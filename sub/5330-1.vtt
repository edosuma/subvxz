to give you the answers

02:11.697 --> 02:14.067
to that history question
on the civil war.

02:14.067 --> 02:17.704

Oh, heavy. Hey, are you sure
you don't want to come over?

02:21.407 --> 02:24.143
Maybe Charlie could
bring a friend or two.

02:24.143 --> 02:25.311
No.

02:25.311 --> 02:27.780

be careful.

in this creepy place,

it's the last time I baby-sit.

Of course I 'm clean.

about the stairs.

12:06.358 --> 12:07.492
I'll clean them.

12:07.492 --> 12:09.261
You know how I like
cleaning gum off of things.

12:09.261 --> 12:13.432
The important thing is that
you calm down and relax.

12:15.501 --> 12:17.970
Well, I 'll be darned.

12:20.638 --> 12:24.376
Aah!

12:27.946 --> 12:31.316
Today is a sad day for me,

12:31.316 --> 12:33.552
perhaps the saddest
in my tenure

12:33.552 --> 12:35.520
as principal
of our school,

12:35.520 --> 12:37.823
dear old Lamab High.

12:37.823 --> 12:40.626
For me, to look
down on the corpses

12:40.626 --> 12:43.562
of 2 former students
is very painful,

12:43.562 --> 12:46.832
and I 'll bet it's no picnic
for the parents either,

12:46.832 --> 12:48.567
but we must go on,

12:48.567 --> 12:51.537
for although
today is a sad day,

12:51.537 --> 12:54.339
it is also a big day--

12:54.339 --> 12:57.509
the day of the big parade.
The big game...

12:57.509 --> 12:59.377
I told her
to be careful.

12:59.377 --> 13:00.444
Shh.

13:00.445 --> 13:01.580
I told her
not to have

13:01.580 --> 13:02.481
Charlie 
come over.

13:03.549 --> 13:05.550
Why wouldn't
she listen?

13:07.553 --> 13:09.487

the big panty raid,

13:11.456 --> 13:13.025

tree trimming.

13:13.025 --> 13:15.361
Stop. How can you
think of sex now?

13:15.361 --> 13:17.729
I can never stop
thinking about it.

13:17.729 --> 13:19.097
Funerals get me hot.

13:19.097 --> 13:22.167
Now this, the big funeral.

13:22.167 --> 13:23.968
Now, we could moan
about the fact

13:23.968 --> 13:25.203
that we have to have

13:25.203 --> 13:27.572
the extracurricular
activities in one day

13:27.572 --> 13:29.908
due to state budget cuts,

13:29.908 --> 13:33.579
but that wouldn't be
in the spirit of Lamab High,

13:33.579 --> 13:34.579
would it?

13:34.579 --> 13:36.915

some protection.

14:17.423 --> 14:19.758

15:22.488 --> 15:25.524
Julie was baby-sitting
at my house when she got it.

15:25.524 --> 15:28.193
Now I wanted you to have
the money I owed her.

15:28.193 --> 15:32.231
It's all there.
5 hours at 65 cents an hour.

15:32.231 --> 15:34.899
Oh, and I also included
Julie 's car fare--

15:34.899 --> 15:36.534
one way, of course.

15:36.534 --> 15:39.204
So, I mean, it's not
your fault, you know?

15:39.204 --> 15:40.839
I've been trying to tell you
that all this time.

15:40.839 --> 15:44.709
Don't worry.
Oh, look. There's Joe.

15:44.709 --> 15:45.710

15:45.711 --> 15:47.513

very funny!

my idea of a joke,

our parking spot.

can be a handicap, too.

done these murders?

I don't know.
It could have been anybody.

16:34.159 --> 16:35.961
Well, it can't
be anybody.

16:35.961 --> 16:37.496
It's gotta be
somebody.

16:37.496 --> 16:38.930
Well, of course,
it's somebody.

16:38.930 --> 16:40.632
But that somebody
could be anybody.

16:40.632 --> 16:42.367
Well, look,
we didn't do it, right?

16:42.367 --> 16:44.069
Right.

16:42.367 --> 16:44.069
So you can't say

16:44.069 --> 16:45.971
it could be anybody.
We're anybody.

16:45.971 --> 16:48.774
True. But
we're also somebody.

16:48.774 --> 16:49.941
Whoever the killer is

16:49.941 --> 16:51.543
couldn't have chosen
a worse day.

16:51.543 --> 16:54.046
In any case, we must
remember the 3 Ps :

16:54.046 --> 16:56.548
No police,
no publicity, and, uh...

16:56.548 --> 16:57.582
No pasta.

16:57.582 --> 16:59.217
Don't let the pressure
get to you, Harlow.

16:59.217 --> 17:01.520
That's
the third &quot;p.&quot;

17:01.520 --> 17:02.954
I can't stand
the pressure.

17:02.955 --> 17:04.255
You're
a brilliant educator.

17:04.255 --> 17:06.392
You need some rest.

17:07.858 --> 17:09.727

17:11.463 --> 17:15.867

how to make...

17:15.867 --> 17:17.068

17:17.068 --> 17:18.435
[class groans]

17:18.435 --> 17:21.003
Perhaps man's highest
cultural achievement

17:21.005 --> 17:23.608
is the horse head bookend.

17:23.608 --> 17:25.542
With rape...

17:25.544 --> 17:27.813
and violence...

17:27.813 --> 17:30.015
rampant in this land.

17:30.015 --> 17:33.151
With human flesh
cheap and...

17:33.151 --> 17:35.654
and vulgarized,

17:35.654 --> 17:38.123
one of the last bastions
of decency

17:38.123 --> 17:40.893
is the gentle satisfaction
one gains

17:40.893 --> 17:45.230
from making
a horse head bookend.

17:46.798 --> 17:47.766
Just a minute, son.

17:48.767 --> 17:49.734
Me, sir?

17:49.734 --> 17:53.639
Yeah, yeah, the one
in the bed sheets.

17:53.639 --> 17:56.841
Take that tambourine
off your head.

17:56.841 --> 17:58.043
You belong to this school?

17:58.043 --> 17:59.043
Yes, sir.

17:59.043 --> 18:00.846
My name is Mawamba.

18:00.846 --> 18:02.647
Is that a fact?

18:02.647 --> 18:05.050
Do you know the school year
began in September?

18:05.050 --> 18:06.584
This is
the last day in June.

18:06.584 --> 18:09.388
I'm a bussing student,
sir, from the zowie.

18:09.388 --> 18:10.789
The zowie?
That near Philadelphia?

18:12.224 --> 18:13.792
It's in Africa, sir.
That's why I 'm late.

18:15.326 --> 18:16.928
My bus just got in.

18:16.928 --> 18:18.763
Do you know
anything about...

18:18.763 --> 18:19.898
horse head bookends?

18:19.898 --> 18:20.799
No, sir.

18:21.500 --> 18:22.768
Good.

18:22.768 --> 18:25.403
Now we only have
one day to work with you

18:25.403 --> 18:27.439
'cause it's
the last day of school.

18:27.439 --> 18:29.674
Now you're gonna make
horse heads, jungle boy.

18:29.674 --> 18:33.078
You're gonna have horse heads
coming out of your ears.

18:33.078 --> 18:34.346
Now one more question.

18:34.346 --> 18:37.482
Would you mind
telling me...

18:37.482 --> 18:39.283
how come you're not
in your neighborhood school?

18:39.283 --> 18:40.985
It's a court order.

18:40.986 --> 18:43.955
A court order, huh?
A court order?

18:43.955 --> 18:46.658
Now that the right people
have taken over this country,

18:46.658 --> 18:49.194
you're gonna see
some real court orders.

18:49.194 --> 18:52.129
Now sit down
and make horse heads.

18:52.130 --> 18:53.331
Now, remember, class...

18:53.331 --> 18:54.533
You won't believe
what I saw over there.

18:54.533 --> 18:55.801
What?

18:55.801 --> 18:57.902
Don't ask.

18:57.902 --> 18:59.904
Look--look at this.

18:59.904 --> 19:01.306
Where did you get that?

19:01.306 --> 19:03.708
I found it where Joe 
and bertha were murdered.

19:03.708 --> 19:05.910
They shouldn't have been
doing that at a funeral.

19:05.910 --> 19:07.579
Talking?

19:07.579 --> 19:10.748
During horse head bookends?

19:10.748 --> 19:11.850
Who was that?

19:13.919 --> 19:15.887
Sure, the girl.

19:15.887 --> 19:18.023
What have we here, Miss...

19:18.023 --> 19:21.326
&quot;Shouldn't be
in the class anyway&quot;?

19:21.326 --> 19:25.063
Well, it's a horse head
bookend, Mr. Duncan.

19:25.063 --> 19:26.932
You stained it
and everything.

19:26.932 --> 19:28.633
Yes, sir.

19:28.633 --> 19:31.937
I couldn't have done
a better job myself.

19:31.937 --> 19:34.872
That's what I was thinking.

19:37.943 --> 19:39.244
Don't mind us, girls.

19:39.244 --> 19:40.812
We prom queen candidates
have to get changed

19:40.812 --> 19:41.745
for the parade.

have to break my ass

and you're hideous.

seen Toby?

20:03.301 --> 20:04.436

with a weapon, and...

the matter with them,

28:31.175 --> 28:32.409
They're gone.

28:36.280 --> 28:37.716
Hardy?

28:42.386 --> 28:43.421
Aah!

28:45.523 --> 28:46.823
What have we here,

28:46.824 --> 28:50.494
Miss &quot;shouldn't be
on the float anyway&quot;?

28:50.494 --> 28:54.164
Wait a minute.

28:54.164 --> 28:55.933
No!

28:55.933 --> 28:58.669
No. I--
I didn't do it!

28:58.669 --> 29:01.539
I didn't do it!
I never do it!

29:01.539 --> 29:03.041
3 down.

29:03.041 --> 29:05.710
This is the anatomy
of the frog,

29:05.710 --> 29:08.612
and here, thousands
of years later, man.

29:08.612 --> 29:09.813
Quite a difference,
huh, class?

29:09.813 --> 29:11.215
And yet
is he perfect?

29:11.215 --> 29:13.318
I think not.

29:13.318 --> 29:15.119
This is totally
unnecessary, ugly,

29:15.119 --> 29:17.955
and gets in the way.
Now...

29:17.955 --> 29:19.491
I can't believe
about all this talk

29:19.491 --> 29:21.625
about Toby being involved
in these murders.

29:21.625 --> 29:23.228
It isn't true.

29:23.228 --> 29:24.028
She's reflecting

29:24.028 --> 29:25.129
very poorly
on our school.

29:25.129 --> 29:26.597
If she has any sense
of self-honor

29:26.597 --> 29:27.866
and decency,
she'd kill herself.

29:29.133 --> 29:32.270
Now, we can't go around
changing men's anatomy,

29:32.270 --> 29:34.906
legally, that is. But
we can change a frog's.

29:34.906 --> 29:36.875
Now if you will all please
expose your frogs.

29:37.742 --> 29:39.744
First, we will remove

29:39.744 --> 29:41.245
all these ugly
little frog penises.

29:41.245 --> 29:42.246
[frog croaks]

29:42.247 --> 29:43.948
Cigarette?

29:43.948 --> 29:46.750
Ok. I'll come
straight to the point.

29:46.750 --> 29:48.919
You're the murderer.

29:48.919 --> 29:50.187
No. That's
impossible!

29:50.187 --> 29:51.854
I wouldn't
hurt a fly.

29:51.855 --> 29:54.359
[fly buzzing]

29:56.761 --> 29:58.763
The girl's
obviously a liar.

29:58.763 --> 29:59.897
Let's give her
the chair.

29:59.897 --> 30:01.232
If you want, I can
saw her head off.

30:01.232 --> 30:03.768
Now wait a minute.
May I make a suggestion?

30:03.768 --> 30:05.736
Instead of sending Toby
directly to jail--

30:05.736 --> 30:07.638
What? And
let her pass go

30:07.638 --> 30:09.774
and collect $200?
No way.

30:09.774 --> 30:11.308
No, I meant
it would be a good idea

30:11.308 --> 30:13.043
if Toby saw
our school psychiatrist

30:13.043 --> 30:14.879
before we came
to any firm conclusions.

30:14.879 --> 30:16.746
I don't believe
in psychiatrists.

30:16.747 --> 30:17.782
What did they
ever do for me?

30:17.782 --> 30:18.949
Obviously
nothing.

30:18.950 --> 30:21.419
Dr. Sigmund is
an eminently--imm--

30:21.419 --> 30:23.387
a top man who has
treated many murderers

30:23.387 --> 30:25.054
before they killed.
I feel strongly

30:25.055 --> 30:26.324
that the proper
course of action

30:26.324 --> 30:29.092
is a thorough psychiatric
consultation. Ok?

30:29.092 --> 30:30.795
No.

30:29.092 --> 30:30.795
I don't think so.

30:30.795 --> 30:33.798
Good. Then it's settled.

30:33.798 --> 30:36.400
Good-bye, and thanks
for your confidence

30:36.400 --> 30:37.334
in me, Mr. Peters.

30:37.334 --> 30:38.803
It's not really
confidence, my dear.

30:38.803 --> 30:41.139
I think you're crazy.

30:48.779 --> 30:52.449
Now let's examine
the evidence again.

30:52.449 --> 30:54.619
Now, here are
the murder weapons.

30:54.619 --> 30:57.521
Now, who would logically
have access to them?

30:57.521 --> 30:58.956
One paperclip.

30:58.956 --> 31:01.259
Harlow,
that's yours.

31:03.161 --> 31:04.963
3 trash bags. Now who
could these belong to?

31:06.431 --> 31:07.298
What's he doing?

31:07.298 --> 31:08.633
This used
to be the rest room

31:08.633 --> 31:10.835
before they remodeled
the building,

31:10.835 --> 31:12.637
and Malvert thinks
it's still here.

31:12.637 --> 31:13.870
I keep a trash can
over there

31:13.871 --> 31:14.973
for just this purpose.

31:16.340 --> 31:17.841
Better to be safe
than sorry.

31:17.842 --> 31:19.844
Of course, the man
deserves some respect.

31:19.844 --> 31:21.679
He was a teacher
before the accident.

31:21.679 --> 31:22.846
What accident?

31:22.846 --> 31:24.482
Oh, he was in
a terrible crash,

31:24.482 --> 31:26.149
he got rammed
from both the front

31:26.150 --> 31:27.952
and the back
at the same time.

31:27.952 --> 31:29.520
Poor fellow
got whiplash

31:29.520 --> 31:30.554
in both directions.

31:30.554 --> 31:33.057
Poor soul. Once
a teacher, now a janitor.

31:33.057 --> 31:35.826
He does enjoy
the raise in pay.

31:35.826 --> 31:38.596
Malvert afford hookers.

31:38.596 --> 31:39.596
All done?

31:39.596 --> 31:41.566
No. [urinates]

31:41.566 --> 31:43.601
Now done.

31:45.903 --> 31:47.672
You can't get
angry with him.

31:47.672 --> 31:49.473
He gets teased
unmercifully.

31:49.473 --> 31:50.874
Wait a minute.

31:50.874 --> 31:54.111
Now, he
could be our man.

31:54.111 --> 31:55.713
Look at him.
Look at him!

31:55.713 --> 31:57.481
He's got blood
on his hands.

31:57.481 --> 31:59.883
No. Since accident,

31:59.883 --> 32:01.919
Malvert 
sometimes pee red.

32:01.919 --> 32:03.454
You know
good urologist?

32:03.454 --> 32:04.621
[telephone rings]

32:04.622 --> 32:07.424
I'll get it. I'm
farthest from the phone.

32:07.424 --> 32:09.860
Miss Mumsley :
That makes sense.

32:09.860 --> 32:12.728
[ring]

32:12.729 --> 32:15.600
[spring breaks]

32:12.729 --> 32:15.600
[ring]

32:15.600 --> 32:16.533
Hello.

32:16.534 --> 32:19.137
Hello! I won't
beat around the bush.

32:19.137 --> 32:21.039
I killed everybody,
and I 'm glad! Heh heh!

32:22.072 --> 32:24.908
I appreciate
your honesty.

32:24.908 --> 32:26.909
What makes your voice
sound so funny?

32:26.910 --> 32:28.712
I'm disguising it,
schmuck.

32:28.712 --> 32:29.780
How?

32:28.712 --> 32:29.780
By talking through

32:29.780 --> 32:30.915
a rubber chicken.

32:30.915 --> 32:32.783
I thought it sounded
like you were

32:32.784 --> 32:34.185
speaking through
a rubber chicken.

32:34.185 --> 32:37.053
Listen, I 'm going to kill
next at the football game.

32:37.054 --> 32:38.856
Click!

32:37.054 --> 32:38.856
Did you hang up?

32:38.856 --> 32:39.890
No. I just said click.

32:39.890 --> 32:41.059
[dial tone]

32:41.892 --> 32:42.993
Well,
who was that?

32:42.993 --> 32:44.861
The killer--
chicken lips.

32:44.862 --> 32:46.263
And if that
was the killer,

32:46.263 --> 32:47.831
then Malvert 
can't be guilty.

32:47.831 --> 32:48.932
You can go,
Malvert.

32:48.932 --> 32:52.703
Damn. Malvert
never get picked!

32:52.703 --> 32:53.904
[bell rings]

32:53.904 --> 32:55.639
I've never been
to a shrink before.

32:55.639 --> 32:56.607
What do I say?

32:56.607 --> 32:57.875
Tell him anything
he wants to hear.

32:57.875 --> 32:59.042
I don't know
what to tell.

32:59.042 --> 33:00.110
Just don't let him
give you a lobotomy

33:00.110 --> 33:01.178
like they did
to Jack Nicholson

33:01.178 --> 33:02.179
in <i> Cuckoo's Nest.</i>

33:02.179 --> 33:03.448
No,
I don't think so.

33:03.448 --> 33:05.649
That would really
mess you up. Don't worry.

33:05.649 --> 33:06.816
I'm scared.

33:06.817 --> 33:07.952
It's routine.

33:07.952 --> 33:10.454
[sniffles] I 'm sorry.

33:10.454 --> 33:12.889
I promised myself
I wouldn't cry.

33:12.890 --> 33:14.092
That's ok. It's
all right to cry.

33:15.860 --> 33:16.894
Perhaps
this will help.

33:16.894 --> 33:18.096
I'm sorry
I'm out of Kleenex.

33:18.963 --> 33:20.964
Thank you, Dr. Sigmund.

33:20.964 --> 33:22.966
Don't be so formal.

33:22.967 --> 33:25.969
Call me Pischer.

33:25.969 --> 33:28.972
Toby,
I'm going to ask you

33:28.972 --> 33:30.007
a difficult
question.

33:30.007 --> 33:31.109
Are you up for it?

33:32.142 --> 33:34.212
I--I think so,
Dr. Sigmund.

33:34.212 --> 33:36.980
Please,
don't be so formal.

33:36.980 --> 33:39.316
Call me daddy.

33:39.316 --> 33:43.020
Daddy? Wouldn't that
be unusual?

33:43.020 --> 33:44.122
Not really, Toby.

33:45.455 --> 33:47.125
You see, some day
I hope to be famous,

33:49.126 --> 33:52.963
a father image
to the disturbed.

33:52.963 --> 33:54.532
All I need is one...

33:54.532 --> 33:55.933
[heavy breathing]

33:55.933 --> 33:58.002
Sensational case.

33:58.002 --> 34:01.806
Multiple personality,
perhaps.

34:01.806 --> 34:04.975
Proof that reincarnation
does exist, perhaps.

34:04.975 --> 34:08.913
The devil
as a patient, perhaps.

34:08.913 --> 34:10.815
Perhaps...

34:10.815 --> 34:13.150
perhaps...

34:13.150 --> 34:16.120
perhaps...perhaps...

34:16.120 --> 34:18.422
perhaps.

34:23.493 --> 34:25.696
Somebody's been
using my office.

34:25.696 --> 34:28.266
[heavy breathing]

34:28.266 --> 34:31.034
Tell me, Toby...

34:31.034 --> 34:33.771
how do you feel
about sex?

34:33.771 --> 34:35.039
What?

34:35.039 --> 34:36.940
Did I pronounce it
right?

34:36.940 --> 34:38.542
Well...

34:38.542 --> 34:41.045
You mean between
a man and a woman.

34:41.045 --> 34:44.081
Yes. Or the species
of your choice.

34:45.149 --> 34:46.183
Well...

34:47.284 --> 34:48.686
well, I think that--

34:48.686 --> 34:50.588
that sex can be
a beautiful thing

34:50.588 --> 34:54.559
if 2 people
are in love and--

34:54.559 --> 34:55.693
and are married

34:55.693 --> 34:59.963
and can share and
care for one another.

34:59.963 --> 35:01.064
Uh-huh.

35:01.064 --> 35:04.335
2 souls
blending into one.

35:04.335 --> 35:07.538
2 hot bodies pressed
 against each other's flesh!

35:07.538 --> 35:08.439
Stop!

35:08.439 --> 35:10.874
But at the same time,

35:10.874 --> 35:13.076
it can be so ugly and--

35:13.076 --> 35:15.913
and dirty and disgusting.

35:15.913 --> 35:17.515
Yuck. My father--

35:17.515 --> 35:19.982
Your father's name
was yuck?

35:19.983 --> 35:21.385
Tell me
about your father.

35:21.385 --> 35:22.786
Did you like yuck?

35:22.786 --> 35:24.988
Oh, no. I hated him.

35:24.988 --> 35:27.124
When I was a child,

35:27.124 --> 35:30.160
he used to beat me
and lock me in my room

35:30.161 --> 35:31.229
with him in it!

35:31.229 --> 35:33.263
Don't call me
daddy anymore.

35:33.264 --> 35:34.232
Well, he--

35:35.165 --> 35:37.067
he told me
that sex was bad

35:37.067 --> 35:38.936
and--and dirty and--

35:38.936 --> 35:39.970
and your mother?

35:39.970 --> 35:41.305
What did
she tell you?

35:41.305 --> 35:43.241
She also told me that
sex was bad and dirty,

35:44.108 --> 35:46.176
but only with my father.

35:46.176 --> 35:48.913
With everyone else,
she said it was great.

35:48.913 --> 35:50.414
[sobbing]

35:54.919 --> 35:56.420
Thank you.

35:56.420 --> 35:58.256
Your fellow students
who were murdered,

35:59.623 --> 36:03.126
they had sex,
didn't they, Toby?

36:03.126 --> 36:06.063
Yes, but I 
tried to warn them.

36:06.063 --> 36:07.264
But the police say

36:07.264 --> 36:09.232
you may be involved
in these murders.

36:09.232 --> 36:12.134
Why would I kill
my best friends?

36:12.135 --> 36:14.138
Listen, you've
gotta believe me!

36:14.138 --> 36:18.142
I believe you, Toby.
But sometimes

36:18.142 --> 36:20.310
the mind plays
strange tricks.

36:20.310 --> 36:22.145
We do things
and afterwards

36:22.145 --> 36:24.348
we don't remember
doing them.

36:24.348 --> 36:26.517
[pipe clunks]
We become forgetful.

36:26.517 --> 36:28.218
Did you know
that forgetfulness

36:28.218 --> 36:30.420
was classified as
a mental illness?

36:30.420 --> 36:33.791
I didn't do anything
I wasn't aware of.

36:33.791 --> 36:35.159
[bell rings]

36:35.159 --> 36:36.727
And--and I don't
feel so well now,

36:36.727 --> 36:39.997
and I 'd like to return
to class, please.

36:39.997 --> 36:41.598
Of course.
We'll continue

36:41.598 --> 36:44.735
some other time.
Good-bye, Sybil,

36:44.735 --> 36:45.803
Uh, eve.

36:45.803 --> 36:48.438
Toby.

36:45.803 --> 36:48.438
Toby.

36:48.438 --> 36:52.143
Today, we will discuss
shakespeare's <i> Hamlet.</i>

36:52.143 --> 36:53.243
Who was Hamlet?

36:53.243 --> 36:54.312
His dog.

36:53.243 --> 36:54.312
His dog?

36:55.179 --> 36:56.246
Wasn't he
a Great Dane?

36:56.246 --> 36:58.249
[students laugh]

36:56.246 --> 36:58.249
Class!

37:00.217 --> 37:01.518
In all my years
of teaching,

37:01.518 --> 37:04.421
that is the stupidest answer
I have ever heard.

37:04.421 --> 37:08.325
Go back
to grammar school.

37:08.325 --> 37:10.060
I know where it is.
I'll show you.

37:10.060 --> 37:12.830
Whoa!

37:10.060 --> 37:12.830
Ok, ok.

37:12.830 --> 37:14.598
Be careful! Hey, where's
your seeing eye dog?

37:14.598 --> 37:17.201
Sorry, man. He stole
my car and everything.

37:17.201 --> 37:19.236
My legs, my legs!

37:19.236 --> 37:20.837
<i>Hamlet</i> is one
of shakespeare's

37:20.837 --> 37:24.908
greatest tragedies.
It is the story of a prince,

37:24.908 --> 37:27.912
the prince of Denmark,
a melancholy man

37:27.912 --> 37:30.913
whose mother is
sleeping with his uncle.

37:30.914 --> 37:32.316
I can relate
to that.

37:32.316 --> 37:35.051
And how does he
solve this problem?

37:35.052 --> 37:37.555
Students: Murder!

37:39.356 --> 37:40.358
Sorry I 'm late.

37:41.091 --> 37:42.526
Take your seat, please.

37:42.526 --> 37:44.327
Peters on P.A.:
Attention, students.

37:44.327 --> 37:47.231
As principal, I am
obligated to report

37:47.231 --> 37:49.300
that Toby Badger
has just come

37:49.300 --> 37:51.235
from a psychiatric session
with Dr. Sigmund.

37:51.235 --> 37:53.337
While Dr. Sigmund
has not reached

37:53.337 --> 37:55.806
any formal conclusion,
he does however feel

37:55.806 --> 37:58.976
there is strong evidence
that Toby may indeed

37:58.976 --> 38:01.946
be the psychotic killer
we've been all looking for.

38:01.946 --> 38:04.415
But until this is confirmed
at a later date,

38:04.415 --> 38:06.384
please treat her just like
any other student.

38:08.251 --> 38:11.355
Murderer!

38:08.251 --> 38:11.355
Bye, killer.

38:17.595 --> 38:19.729
There, there, Harlow.
Don't fret.

38:19.729 --> 38:22.366
You do have
a lot on your mind.

38:22.366 --> 38:24.968
A lot on my mind?
The big day,

38:24.968 --> 38:26.269
the big game,
the big parade,

38:26.269 --> 38:27.837
6 big deaths--

38:27.838 --> 38:29.540
you'd call that
a lot on my mind?

38:29.540 --> 38:31.742
Here, speak
to the student bodies.

38:31.742 --> 38:35.079
You know how you like
having your voice amplified.

38:36.279 --> 38:37.648
Good afternoon, students.

38:37.648 --> 38:41.285
This is Mr. Peters,
your principal.

38:41.285 --> 38:44.855
I have some good news
and some bad news.

38:44.855 --> 38:47.425
The good news is the killer
has definitely been identified

38:48.458 --> 38:49.926
as a psychotic individual

38:49.926 --> 38:52.529
suffering from
paranoiac schizophrenia.

38:52.529 --> 38:54.298
He is armed and dangerous.

38:54.298 --> 38:57.466
The bad news is
we have no idea who it is.

38:57.467 --> 38:59.302
If anyone should
come across an individual

38:59.302 --> 39:01.038
matching this description,

39:01.038 --> 39:02.539
please call me at once,

39:02.539 --> 39:04.507
but don't do it
in front of him.

39:04.507 --> 39:06.310
And remember,
the big football game...

39:06.310 --> 39:08.312
Mr. Malvert,
I wanted to talk to you.

39:08.312 --> 39:10.314
If for some reason
suspicion should fall

39:10.314 --> 39:11.582
on our dear Mr. Peters,

39:11.582 --> 39:13.417
we would like you
to confess.

39:13.417 --> 39:14.683
Well, Mr. Peters

39:14.684 --> 39:16.553
is a valuable asset
to society,

39:16.553 --> 39:18.321
while you are mere scum.

39:18.322 --> 39:20.157
What difference
would jail make to you?

39:20.157 --> 39:21.625
You'll have fun
with the boys.

39:21.625 --> 39:23.594
Women don't
like you much now.

39:23.594 --> 39:25.629
I certainly don't.

39:25.629 --> 39:29.332
Homosexuality is
the up-and-coming thing.

39:29.332 --> 39:31.469
[band playing]

39:33.904 --> 39:35.673
Call again.

39:35.673 --> 39:36.774
Mine.

39:43.247 --> 39:44.848
[blows whistle]

39:44.849 --> 39:47.385
[crowd cheering]

39:52.355 --> 39:53.891
All right! Come on!

40:01.165 --> 40:03.600
Man, wheels, how'd you
get such great seats?

40:03.600 --> 40:04.935
The 50-yard line.

40:04.935 --> 40:07.238
Yeah, I used my influence.
Give me the money.

40:07.238 --> 40:08.906
Oh, yeah, yeah.

40:09.906 --> 40:12.509
[band playing]

40:14.345 --> 40:16.147
[crowd cheering]

40:27.725 --> 40:30.093
Red hots! Hot dogs!
Peanuts!

40:30.093 --> 40:31.394
Give me a hot dog.

40:31.394 --> 40:33.395
Here's your hot dog.
You want mustard?

40:33.396 --> 40:34.965
Yeah, give me some--

40:34.965 --> 40:36.533
How about
something to drink?

40:36.533 --> 40:37.535
Yeah, gi--
[gulps]

40:39.402 --> 40:40.637
Hot dog.

40:39.402 --> 40:40.637
Hot dog!

40:40.637 --> 40:43.407
Here's your hot dog.
Here's your hot dog.

40:43.407 --> 40:45.475
Here, you want
mustard, too?

40:45.475 --> 40:46.544
Here you are.

40:47.844 --> 40:49.513
Peanuts!

40:49.513 --> 40:50.815
Here.

40:52.650 --> 40:54.284
I'm gonna buy you
a hot dog.

40:54.284 --> 40:55.986
Then you'll
like Malvert.

40:55.986 --> 40:57.555
Hot dog!

41:01.391 --> 41:02.726
Malvert: Slut! Slut!

41:02.726 --> 41:06.464
All women alike!
All women with Malvert.

41:19.777 --> 41:20.978
I still think
the boys are being killed

41:20.978 --> 41:23.380
and then stuffed
in the trash bags.

41:23.380 --> 41:25.248
Not necessarily.
It's a well-known fact

41:25.248 --> 41:27.818
that if you put a male
inside a 3-ply hefty bag,

41:27.818 --> 41:29.152
tightly tied at the top,

41:29.152 --> 41:31.287
they'll suffocate
in a matter of minutes.

41:31.287 --> 41:32.422
You can believe me.

41:32.422 --> 41:33.557
That's how
they were murdered.

41:33.557 --> 41:37.026
You're on. Hey, chief,
get over here.

41:39.163 --> 41:40.230
Yes, sir?

41:40.230 --> 41:41.231
Get in the bag.

41:41.231 --> 41:42.232
Why?

41:42.232 --> 41:43.234
Because
I told you so.

41:43.234 --> 41:44.567
Yes, sir.

41:46.903 --> 41:48.471
Oof!

41:48.472 --> 41:50.641
[blows whistle]

41:51.475 --> 41:53.511
[blows whistle]

42:02.052 --> 42:05.556
[thumping]

42:09.993 --> 42:12.696
I'm bad.
That's right. I'm bad.

42:12.696 --> 42:15.464
Hey, blood. Hey, bro.
What's happenin'?

42:15.465 --> 42:17.634
Hey, blood. Whoo!

42:17.634 --> 42:19.870
[crowd cheering]

42:21.438 --> 42:22.873
Try to get out.

42:32.016 --> 42:33.651
[whistle blows]

42:48.933 --> 42:50.668
All right.

42:52.369 --> 42:53.536
Come on!

42:53.536 --> 42:56.674
This is boring.
The game sucks anyway.

43:11.154 --> 43:13.056
Excuse me. I have
to make a phone call.

43:13.056 --> 43:15.192
I got a phone
right here.

43:16.560 --> 43:17.794
I feel like grabbing
a quick shave.

43:17.794 --> 43:20.931
Oh? I used
to be a barber.

43:20.931 --> 43:22.566
I just remembered
I must pick up my daughter

43:22.566 --> 43:23.834
at the airport.

43:23.834 --> 43:25.569
Daddy, daddy,
the plane was early!

43:25.569 --> 43:26.937
I'm back!

43:26.937 --> 43:29.807
Come on. Everybody
will be watching the game.

43:43.387 --> 43:45.722
Stop! Look
at all this crap!

43:45.722 --> 43:48.492
Come on, baby.
Come on.

43:48.492 --> 43:49.727
No. Al, let's stop.
It's cold.

43:50.594 --> 43:52.529
All this garbage
is falling.

43:52.529 --> 43:54.297
The garbage
gets me hot.

43:54.297 --> 43:55.766
Ohh!

43:54.297 --> 43:55.766
Ok, ok, stay here.

43:55.766 --> 43:56.833
I'll get a blanket
and a broom.

43:56.833 --> 43:58.369
Ok. Hurry, hurry.

44:01.305 --> 44:02.305
I'm going.

44:02.305 --> 44:03.707
Wrong time. Don't!

44:03.707 --> 44:05.308
I'm just gonna
keep an eye on her.

44:05.309 --> 44:06.310
Toby.

44:29.232 --> 44:33.237
[heavy breathing]

44:36.807 --> 44:38.908
[breath catches]

44:41.344 --> 44:44.748
Heeeere's Breather!

44:44.748 --> 44:46.349
Al? An eraser?!

44:46.349 --> 44:47.351
Aah!

44:47.351 --> 44:49.687
[crowd cheering]

44:56.526 --> 44:58.127
Joan?

45:00.296 --> 45:01.798
Al?

45:01.798 --> 45:03.866
I saw you guys
come down here,

45:03.867 --> 45:07.671
and I just don't think
is a very good idea.

45:07.671 --> 45:08.705
[thud]

45:08.705 --> 45:10.007
Ohh!

45:18.681 --> 45:19.816
Joan, I 've got 'em.

45:19.816 --> 45:22.319
Best broom and blanket
money can buy.

45:24.087 --> 45:25.689
Joan?

45:25.689 --> 45:26.957
You look terrible.

45:26.957 --> 45:28.924
What's
this white powder?

45:28.925 --> 45:31.328
Ecch,
cut with chalk.

45:32.496 --> 45:33.831
Joan?

45:34.631 --> 45:36.799
No! No! No!

45:36.800 --> 45:39.336
[crowd cheering]

45:45.642 --> 45:47.410
[whistle blows]

45:47.410 --> 45:49.812
[heavy breathing]

45:51.481 --> 45:52.349
[whistle blows]

45:53.550 --> 45:54.351
[team cheers]

45:56.486 --> 45:57.354
Referee: No touchdown.

45:58.988 --> 46:03.426
Dead bodies on field.
15-yard penalty.

46:03.427 --> 46:04.528
Take off.

46:06.964 --> 46:08.431
[blows whistle]

46:08.431 --> 46:10.367
All right, listen up now.

46:10.367 --> 46:12.436
There's been
another double murder.

46:12.436 --> 46:14.571
A killer is among us.

46:14.571 --> 46:16.239
All you people
who have had

46:16.239 --> 46:19.009
no previous duress
for criminal charges,

46:19.009 --> 46:20.878
leave the stadium.

46:31.354 --> 46:33.756
All those who have had
no motives

46:33.756 --> 46:35.459
in connection
with this killing,

46:35.459 --> 46:36.459
you can go home.

46:36.459 --> 46:39.395
[crowd murmuring]

46:43.000 --> 46:44.268
All right, now.

46:44.268 --> 46:46.903
All those whose parents
are of the same sex,

46:46.903 --> 46:48.238
you can go.

46:49.739 --> 46:52.276
Damn. Question
was too obvious.

46:52.276 --> 46:55.444
Sheriff: Well, hell,
we ain't got no suspect.

46:55.445 --> 46:57.647
Peters: Where's Toby Badger?
Has anybody seen her?

46:57.647 --> 46:58.982
Sheriff: No, not me.

46:58.982 --> 47:01.351
She's been found on the scene
of all the crimes.

47:01.351 --> 47:04.254
Sheriff: Well, sounds
like the killer to me.

47:04.254 --> 47:05.422
Ok, I want
everyone deputized.

47:06.756 --> 47:08.725
Spread out and
reconnoiter the area.

47:08.725 --> 47:10.827
Any questions?
Yes, Dr. Sigmund.

47:10.827 --> 47:12.496
Dr. Sigmund: Yes,
where did you learn

47:12.496 --> 47:14.264
to speak English,
a zoo?

47:14.264 --> 47:17.400
I understand this killer
strikes only those

47:17.400 --> 47:19.303
who are having sex.

47:19.303 --> 47:20.603
That could wipe out
the entire senior class.

47:20.603 --> 47:21.738
Wait a minute!

47:21.738 --> 47:23.038
No students leave
the school grounds

47:23.039 --> 47:24.808
without filling out
the proper forms.

47:24.808 --> 47:26.076
But they're dead.

47:26.076 --> 47:27.310
Nurse: If we make
an exception for the dead,

47:27.310 --> 47:30.113
we have to make
an exception for everyone!

47:30.113 --> 47:32.182
I better get my forms.

47:35.419 --> 47:36.519
[engine starts]

47:36.519 --> 47:43.725
[siren]

47:43.726 --> 47:44.794
Damn it, son.

47:44.794 --> 47:47.029
We've been here
for 2 hours now,

47:47.029 --> 47:48.899
and we're not
letting you go anywhere

47:48.899 --> 47:51.468
until you tell us
where the murderess is

47:51.468 --> 47:54.037
of these 2 young bodies.

47:54.037 --> 47:56.038
Now, tell me, boy,

47:56.039 --> 48:00.210
have you ever seen
a dead body? Huh?

48:00.210 --> 48:04.815
Well, now,
has anybody in this room

48:04.815 --> 48:07.117
ever seen a dead body?

48:19.028 --> 48:20.096
Now talk, boy.

48:20.797 --> 48:21.964
I'm not a suspect,

48:21.964 --> 48:23.566
and you can't keep me
here any longer,

48:23.566 --> 48:27.403
and if you had any decency,
you'd remove these bodies.

48:27.403 --> 48:29.640
[farts]

48:30.707 --> 48:33.977
There's something
in the air.

48:33.977 --> 48:35.112
Ok. Who had beans
for lunch?

48:35.979 --> 48:37.078
Who did it?

48:35.979 --> 48:37.078
He did.

48:37.079 --> 48:38.415
Peters:
But he's dead.

48:38.415 --> 48:39.616
Nurse:
It's a well-known fact

48:39.616 --> 48:41.151
that corpses
can pass wind,

48:41.151 --> 48:44.988
urinate,
have erections.

48:44.988 --> 48:46.589
There's an old
Welsh saying--

48:46.590 --> 48:49.326
&quot;Dead men tell no tales,
but they fart.&quot;

48:49.326 --> 48:50.994
this investigation's
going nowhere.

48:50.994 --> 48:52.629
I'm getting
out of here.

48:52.629 --> 48:53.897
[ring]

48:53.897 --> 48:55.232
That was
a high-pitched one.

48:55.232 --> 48:56.800
That was
the phone.

48:56.800 --> 48:57.801
Hello.

48:57.801 --> 48:58.935
Hello again.

48:58.935 --> 49:00.770
Chicken lips again.

49:00.771 --> 49:02.673
Put him on
the speakerphone.

49:02.673 --> 49:05.008
I will kill next
at the prom.

49:05.008 --> 49:07.444
Oh, yeah? Click.

49:07.444 --> 49:08.812
Did you hang up?

49:08.812 --> 49:11.647
No. I just said click.

49:11.648 --> 49:13.016
Ha ha. I got him.

49:13.016 --> 49:15.986
[farts]

49:15.986 --> 49:18.154
Eww! God!

49:19.089 --> 49:21.959
Coach:
Don't you leave town.

49:22.692 --> 49:24.261
[whispering]
Toby.

49:24.261 --> 49:25.661
Toby.

49:25.661 --> 49:26.997
Toby, wake up.

49:26.997 --> 49:28.231
I didn't do it.

49:28.231 --> 49:31.734
Toby, it's me,
Hardy.

49:31.734 --> 49:33.703
Hardy, where am I?

49:33.703 --> 49:35.038
[sniffs]

49:35.038 --> 49:37.107
Cleveland?

someone finds us?

01:00:26.288 --> 01:00:27.924
Patti...

01:00:29.225 --> 01:00:31.227
double time.

01:00:34.129 --> 01:00:35.231
At ease.

01:00:35.231 --> 01:00:36.232
I'm nervous.

01:00:36.232 --> 01:00:38.034
There's nothing
to be nervous about.

01:00:38.034 --> 01:00:39.335
I'm worried.

01:00:39.335 --> 01:00:40.669
What are you
worried about?

01:00:40.669 --> 01:00:41.703
I'm scared.

01:00:41.704 --> 01:00:43.472
Would you pipe down
and strip?

01:00:43.472 --> 01:00:45.875
I wanna get this over with
before you change your mind.

01:00:45.875 --> 01:00:48.143
I've changed my mind.

01:00:48.143 --> 01:00:50.079
What if the murderer
should find us?

01:00:50.079 --> 01:00:51.247
How's he gonna
find us here?

01:00:52.348 --> 01:00:54.316
I can't do it with
all these horse heads

01:00:54.316 --> 01:00:55.350
staring at me.

01:00:55.351 --> 01:00:56.452
I can't help it.

01:00:56.452 --> 01:00:58.688
These horse heads
make me hot.

01:00:58.688 --> 01:01:01.357
[whispering]
Horse heads?

01:01:01.357 --> 01:01:02.424
[clunk]

01:01:02.424 --> 01:01:03.426
What was that?

01:01:03.426 --> 01:01:04.426
Rahr!

01:01:04.426 --> 01:01:05.795
I heard heavy breathing.

01:01:05.795 --> 01:01:07.763
It's me.
Look, it's safe.

01:01:07.763 --> 01:01:09.966
I got protection.

01:01:11.667 --> 01:01:12.902
You don't have one,

01:01:12.902 --> 01:01:13.935
and don't
try to tell me

01:01:13.935 --> 01:01:15.138
you've
had a vasectomy.

01:01:15.138 --> 01:01:17.072
Please don't
pull that line.

01:01:17.072 --> 01:01:18.274
Look, I know
where I can get one.

01:01:19.275 --> 01:01:20.343
Where?

01:01:20.343 --> 01:01:22.611
I planned an occasion
like this last summer.

01:01:22.611 --> 01:01:25.580
I got one
planted upstairs.

01:01:25.581 --> 01:01:26.682
[chuckles]
Where are you going?

01:01:26.682 --> 01:01:27.883
Behind
the men's room toilet.

01:01:27.883 --> 01:01:29.551
Ha! You're crazy.

01:01:29.552 --> 01:01:31.153
I got the idea
from <i> Godfather I.</i>

01:01:31.153 --> 01:01:32.421
Wait here, and
don't open the door

01:01:32.421 --> 01:01:33.888
for anyone but me.

01:01:33.889 --> 01:01:36.358
That's an order,
soldier.

01:01:36.358 --> 01:01:38.161
[laughs]

01:02:00.850 --> 01:02:02.384
[rumbling]

01:02:02.385 --> 01:02:03.419
Scott?

01:02:04.587 --> 01:02:06.456
Scott?

01:02:07.522 --> 01:02:10.093
[rumbling growing louder]

01:02:25.474 --> 01:02:26.342
Aah!

01:02:27.577 --> 01:02:28.344
Who is it?

01:02:29.411 --> 01:02:30.680
[heavy breathing]

01:02:30.680 --> 01:02:32.915
Oh, it's you!
You brought me the crown.

01:02:32.915 --> 01:02:35.117
Oh, I 'm prom queen
after all.

01:02:35.117 --> 01:02:36.084
Aah!

01:02:36.084 --> 01:02:40.356
[machine gun fire,
explosions, sirens]

01:02:47.696 --> 01:02:51.299
[train bell ringing]

01:02:51.300 --> 01:02:52.968
[noises stop]

01:02:52.968 --> 01:02:54.236
All right, soldier.

01:02:54.236 --> 01:02:55.537
You countermanded
a direct order

01:02:55.537 --> 01:02:57.071
by leaving
that door open,

01:02:57.072 --> 01:02:58.174
and as soon
as we're done here,

01:02:58.174 --> 01:03:00.009
you're gonna
police the whole area.

01:03:00.842 --> 01:03:02.145
Scott: Patti?

01:03:03.946 --> 01:03:06.382
[singsong]
Just kidding.

01:03:07.549 --> 01:03:09.519
Look, another minute,
I'll have my clothes off,

01:03:09.519 --> 01:03:11.218
and, uh...

01:03:11.219 --> 01:03:12.854
we'll break the rules
together.

01:03:12.854 --> 01:03:14.356
And don't worry about it--

01:03:14.356 --> 01:03:16.392
one fully-tested safety,
government-issued,

01:03:17.527 --> 01:03:19.295
and I even
cleaned my weapon.

01:03:20.396 --> 01:03:22.198
Patti?

01:03:25.267 --> 01:03:27.970
Patti, you finally
got your crown.

01:03:27.970 --> 01:03:29.805
Mother of god
and country,

01:03:29.805 --> 01:03:30.906
you're dead.

01:03:30.906 --> 01:03:33.843
Let's have one
for old times' sake.

01:03:33.843 --> 01:03:35.810
Bleah.

01:03:35.811 --> 01:03:37.479
Well, I won't
be needing this.

01:03:37.479 --> 01:03:40.482
[heavy breathing]

01:03:40.482 --> 01:03:42.218
Who is that?

01:03:45.487 --> 01:03:46.656
Who's there?

01:03:46.656 --> 01:03:48.490
Hey, I 'm trying
to get laid here.

01:03:48.490 --> 01:03:50.792
[heavy breathing]

01:03:50.792 --> 01:03:52.494
No!

01:03:52.494 --> 01:03:53.729
Aah!

01:03:53.729 --> 01:03:57.499
[rustling]

01:03:57.499 --> 01:03:59.435
[heavy breathing]

01:04:06.441 --> 01:04:08.778
Aw, poor kids.

01:04:08.778 --> 01:04:10.580
They bought the farm.

01:04:11.980 --> 01:04:13.515
At least I 'm safe.

01:04:13.515 --> 01:04:15.016
[chain saw buzzing]

01:04:15.016 --> 01:04:17.519
Feet, do your stuff!

01:04:17.519 --> 01:04:20.857
[heavy breathing]

01:04:20.857 --> 01:04:22.458
What are you doing?
What's up with the saw?

01:04:24.660 --> 01:04:25.461
Ohh, I get it.
I get it.

01:04:27.763 --> 01:04:29.031
You're the killer.

01:04:29.031 --> 01:04:30.465
[chain saw buzzes]

01:04:30.465 --> 01:04:33.335
Look, you've killed
10 people already.

01:04:33.335 --> 01:04:35.705
11 is the legal limit
in this state.

01:04:35.705 --> 01:04:38.274
Best thing you can do
is just unplug the chain saw

01:04:38.274 --> 01:04:40.308
and--and hand it over to me.

01:04:40.309 --> 01:04:41.543
[buzz]

01:04:41.543 --> 01:04:42.945
Keep it.

01:04:42.945 --> 01:04:44.780
What do you want,
my life?

01:04:44.780 --> 01:04:46.315
What would you
 do with it?

01:04:46.315 --> 01:04:49.118
Take my car.
It's a gorgeous k-car.

01:04:49.118 --> 01:04:50.553
I just washed it
an hour ago.

01:04:50.553 --> 01:04:52.821
I buy Japanese.

01:04:52.821 --> 01:04:54.923
[heavy breathing]

01:04:54.923 --> 01:04:58.361
Ooh, better idea.

01:04:58.361 --> 01:05:00.362
While you got
the buzz saw,

01:05:00.362 --> 01:05:01.897
I'll teach you how
to make horse head bookends

01:05:01.897 --> 01:05:02.999
for all your books.

01:05:02.999 --> 01:05:04.366
Ah, ptuh!

01:05:04.367 --> 01:05:05.901
Ah, you probably don't
have much time for reading,

01:05:05.901 --> 01:05:07.036
what with your schedule.

01:05:07.036 --> 01:05:08.504
Only smut.

01:05:08.504 --> 01:05:09.505
Please...

01:05:10.672 --> 01:05:12.508
from one sicko
to another,

01:05:12.508 --> 01:05:13.509
I'm begging you...

01:05:14.377 --> 01:05:16.511
[chuckles]

01:05:16.511 --> 01:05:17.613
[crying]
Mommy...

01:05:17.613 --> 01:05:19.513
mommy.

01:05:19.514 --> 01:05:24.553
[chain saw buzzing]

01:05:27.056 --> 01:05:30.359
Ah ah ah ah.

01:05:33.595 --> 01:05:34.796
Not bad.

01:05:34.796 --> 01:05:36.098
Ahh.

01:05:37.633 --> 01:05:40.569
Were you gonna use that--
that on flesh?

01:05:40.569 --> 01:05:41.670
Uh-huh.

01:05:41.670 --> 01:05:43.105
Where's your rotary?

01:05:43.105 --> 01:05:44.440
That's for wood.

01:05:44.440 --> 01:05:45.675
Huh? Ahh!

01:05:46.875 --> 01:05:48.176
I can see
the heavy breathing,

01:05:48.176 --> 01:05:50.312
but shut off the buzz saw.

01:05:50.312 --> 01:05:51.580
[chain saw
shuts off]

01:05:51.580 --> 01:05:53.015
Good.

01:05:53.015 --> 01:05:55.051
Now, this is
what you gotta do.

01:05:55.051 --> 01:05:57.987
First, unplug
the buzz saw.

01:05:59.021 --> 01:06:00.723
Good.

01:06:00.723 --> 01:06:01.590
Now oil it
and clean it.

01:06:02.858 --> 01:06:04.026
[sprays oil]

01:06:04.026 --> 01:06:05.460
Wipe that grease off.

01:06:05.460 --> 01:06:06.696
Ahh!

01:06:09.365 --> 01:06:11.033
Good.

01:06:11.033 --> 01:06:13.101
Now put it back
in the case.

01:06:13.101 --> 01:06:16.038
[heavy
breathing]

01:06:16.038 --> 01:06:17.606
Put it back on the shelf
where it belongs.

01:06:19.741 --> 01:06:21.177
[thunk]

01:06:22.445 --> 01:06:24.714
Ha ha ha.

01:06:26.816 --> 01:06:29.118
[keys jingling]

01:06:49.738 --> 01:06:52.040
[balloons squeak]

01:06:58.381 --> 01:07:00.649
[rattling]

01:07:21.537 --> 01:07:23.638
[balloons squeak]

01:07:58.674 --> 01:08:01.309
Harlow, Harlow,
where are you going?

01:08:01.309 --> 01:08:02.444
I'm gonna check
my office.

01:08:02.444 --> 01:08:04.913
I think
I lost my keys

01:08:04.913 --> 01:08:06.715
and my cheese.

01:08:18.193 --> 01:08:20.496
[marbles rattling]

01:08:48.023 --> 01:08:50.426
Toby, thinking:
Harlot.

01:08:50.426 --> 01:08:51.926
Slut.

01:08:51.926 --> 01:08:52.760
Floozie.

01:08:54.229 --> 01:08:56.799
Bad girl.
Whore.

01:08:56.799 --> 01:08:57.832
Bimbo.

01:08:57.832 --> 01:08:59.666
Toby.

01:08:59.667 --> 01:09:02.037
Oh.

01:09:02.037 --> 01:09:04.372
Oh, Mr. Peters.

01:09:04.372 --> 01:09:05.841
You--
you startled me.

01:09:05.841 --> 01:09:07.576
I wouldn't
want to do that.

01:09:07.576 --> 01:09:09.211
Um...

01:09:09.211 --> 01:09:10.845
I wanted
to thank you

01:09:10.845 --> 01:09:11.779
for having
Dr. Sigmund, um,

01:09:14.116 --> 01:09:15.149
have those sessions
with me.

01:09:15.149 --> 01:09:16.518
It was very helpful.

01:09:16.518 --> 01:09:17.553
Oh?

01:09:17.553 --> 01:09:19.053
And that's why
you're here in my office?

01:09:19.053 --> 01:09:21.890
Yes!
Yes, that's right.

01:09:21.890 --> 01:09:23.658
Toby, I 'm curious.

01:09:23.658 --> 01:09:25.861
Did you expect to find me
in the filing cabinet?

01:09:25.861 --> 01:09:28.796
Oh. Oh, that.

01:09:28.796 --> 01:09:30.365
Oh, you mean these?

01:09:30.365 --> 01:09:31.800
Well, I was looking
at these pictures,

01:09:33.702 --> 01:09:36.438
and--and, well,
I couldn't wait

01:09:36.438 --> 01:09:37.906
for the yearbook
to come out.

01:09:37.906 --> 01:09:38.807
Is that so, Toby?

01:09:39.642 --> 01:09:42.676
No. Um...

01:09:42.676 --> 01:09:44.345
do you really want
to know the truth?

01:09:44.345 --> 01:09:46.348
Yes, Toby.
Tell me the truth.

01:09:46.348 --> 01:09:48.649
[sighs] Well--

01:09:48.649 --> 01:09:51.385
well, the truth is--
it's that--

01:09:51.386 --> 01:09:53.689
well, as you know,
everyone suspects me

01:09:53.689 --> 01:09:56.292
of having something
to do with the murders,

01:09:56.292 --> 01:09:57.692
like me
being the murderer.

01:09:57.692 --> 01:10:00.495
And--and--and so
I was just thinking--

01:10:00.495 --> 01:10:02.698
Yes, go on, Toby.
What were you thinking?

01:10:02.698 --> 01:10:04.700
Well, to tell you
the truth,

01:10:04.700 --> 01:10:06.501
I didn't know
what to think.

01:10:06.501 --> 01:10:09.004
You're a bright girl, Toby.

01:10:09.004 --> 01:10:12.674
Surely you have some theory
developed by now.

01:10:12.674 --> 01:10:13.842
Well, yes,
as a matter of fact,

01:10:15.711 --> 01:10:16.845
I think that
the murderer knew

01:10:18.414 --> 01:10:22.084
all the victims.

01:10:22.084 --> 01:10:23.751
Yes, go on.

01:10:23.752 --> 01:10:27.923
And he must've had
access to the school...

01:10:27.923 --> 01:10:29.191
Good. Good.

01:10:29.191 --> 01:10:32.327
Because of
the murder weapons.

01:10:33.395 --> 01:10:36.231
Toby: Someone
who's immature

01:10:36.231 --> 01:10:37.566
and crazy and--

01:10:37.566 --> 01:10:40.135
and deranged and--

01:10:40.135 --> 01:10:41.503
and someone
who wanted to see

01:10:41.503 --> 01:10:44.873
harm come
to the students.

01:10:44.873 --> 01:10:45.941
Someone like--

01:10:45.941 --> 01:10:47.742
someone like
the principal.

01:10:47.742 --> 01:10:50.879
Yes, someone
like the principal.

01:10:52.948 --> 01:10:55.484
Mr. Peters!

01:10:56.851 --> 01:10:58.853
You're naked!

01:10:58.854 --> 01:10:59.855
Yes, Toby.

01:10:59.855 --> 01:11:01.924
All these years
I've been secretly naked

01:11:01.924 --> 01:11:02.824
underneath my clothes.

01:11:02.824 --> 01:11:05.160
But did anyone notice?
Any girls?

01:11:05.160 --> 01:11:06.760
Any prom queen candidates?

01:11:06.761 --> 01:11:07.663
No.

01:11:07.663 --> 01:11:10.464
All those lithesome
budding bodies

01:11:10.465 --> 01:11:12.401
changing from girlhood
to womanhood,

01:11:12.401 --> 01:11:14.402
like moths
into butterflies,

01:11:14.402 --> 01:11:16.671
year after year,
right before my eyes.

01:11:16.671 --> 01:11:19.041
Do you realize
how that affects a man?

01:11:19.041 --> 01:11:19.908
Um...
it makes you hot?

01:11:22.210 --> 01:11:23.812
That's right, Toby.

01:11:23.812 --> 01:11:26.281
It makes me...hot.

01:11:26.281 --> 01:11:28.483
Especially the naughty ones

01:11:28.483 --> 01:11:29.852
like Julie 
and Bertha and Joan

01:11:29.852 --> 01:11:31.553
and Dagmar.

01:11:31.553 --> 01:11:32.954
[heavy breathing]

01:11:32.954 --> 01:11:35.090
Do you want to know why
I think they were murdered?

01:11:35.090 --> 01:11:35.924
No. Yes!

01:11:36.991 --> 01:11:38.426
Why?

01:11:38.426 --> 01:11:39.894
Because they were naughty.

01:11:39.894 --> 01:11:40.929
Naughty?

01:11:40.929 --> 01:11:42.798
Disgustingly naughty.

01:11:42.798 --> 01:11:47.001
Each and every one of them
was caught doing...sex.

01:11:47.002 --> 01:11:49.170
Sex? Yuck!

01:11:49.170 --> 01:11:50.806
That's right, Toby.
Yecch.

01:11:50.806 --> 01:11:53.007
Sex is dirty
and sex is bad.

01:11:53.007 --> 01:11:56.009
Yes. Yes, I agree.
I--

01:11:56.010 --> 01:11:57.045
well, I don't know.

01:11:57.045 --> 01:11:58.680
I've never
really done it.

01:11:58.680 --> 01:12:00.014
But you would
like to do it,

01:12:00.014 --> 01:12:01.016
wouldn't you?

01:12:01.016 --> 01:12:03.652
Yes. No! No.

01:12:03.652 --> 01:12:06.788
Excuse me a moment.
I'll be right back.

01:12:06.788 --> 01:12:07.955
What--what are you
going to do?

01:12:09.691 --> 01:12:13.028
Have you ever seen
our school trophy, Toby?

01:12:13.028 --> 01:12:14.396
No, I--

01:12:14.396 --> 01:12:16.465
I never knew
we ever won a trophy.

01:12:16.465 --> 01:12:17.832
Oh, we did.

01:12:17.832 --> 01:12:21.737
In 20 years,
we only won one trophy.

01:12:21.737 --> 01:12:26.041
Ahh, the typing team
really came through that year.

01:12:26.041 --> 01:12:27.508
Typing team?

01:12:27.508 --> 01:12:29.311
We retired the typewriter,

01:12:29.311 --> 01:12:31.346
but we kept the trophy.

01:12:31.346 --> 01:12:33.882
I'll be back.

01:12:33.882 --> 01:12:35.918
[door closes]

01:12:40.055 --> 01:12:41.290
[ringing]

01:12:41.290 --> 01:12:43.858
Hello?
Hello, um--

01:12:43.858 --> 01:12:46.728
Listen, I 'm in
terrible danger

01:12:46.728 --> 01:12:48.330
and I need
some help.

01:12:48.330 --> 01:12:50.398
Recording: You have
reached the police.

01:12:50.398 --> 01:12:52.066
We are closed.

01:12:52.066 --> 01:12:53.867
Look out behind you!

01:12:53.868 --> 01:12:56.004
[gasps]

01:12:56.004 --> 01:12:57.138
I'm back again.

01:12:57.138 --> 01:12:58.006
Look.
Look behind you.

01:12:59.808 --> 01:13:02.911
You're not going to fool me
with that old trick.

01:13:03.879 --> 01:13:06.080
See? I was right.

01:13:06.080 --> 01:13:09.251
This is our trophy, Toby.

01:13:09.251 --> 01:13:10.018
Look!

01:13:10.785 --> 01:13:12.855
No!

01:13:12.855 --> 01:13:15.857
[bell clanking]

01:13:35.109 --> 01:13:37.278
Miss Mumsley : Well,
she's not in the men's room.

01:13:37.278 --> 01:13:38.346
Malvert:
When we catch her,

01:13:38.346 --> 01:13:39.915
can Malvert 
kill her first, ok?

01:13:39.915 --> 01:13:43.051
Ok, but I get
first crack at her.

01:13:43.051 --> 01:13:45.153
[voices arguing]

01:13:45.153 --> 01:13:46.554
Dr. Sigmund:
hello, all.

01:13:46.554 --> 01:13:48.923
Dr. Sigmund,
what are you doing here?

01:13:48.923 --> 01:13:50.392
And what's
that hideous creature

01:13:50.392 --> 01:13:51.626
at the end
of the leash?

01:13:51.626 --> 01:13:53.862
I tamper with
nature as a hobby.

01:13:53.862 --> 01:13:55.997
I crossed a flounder
with a walrus

01:13:55.997 --> 01:13:57.032
and a horny toad.

01:13:57.032 --> 01:13:58.533
What did you get?

01:13:58.533 --> 01:14:00.134
A fish with warts
and a mustache

01:14:00.134 --> 01:14:01.203
that can't
get a date.

01:14:01.203 --> 01:14:04.239
It really belongs
in a zoo.

01:14:04.239 --> 01:14:06.273
Thanks,
but they refused it.

01:14:06.274 --> 01:14:07.075
Well, good night.

01:14:08.876 --> 01:14:10.078
She's got to be
here someplace.

01:14:11.346 --> 01:14:13.080
I'll look
in the men's room.

01:14:13.081 --> 01:14:14.149
Malvert: Ok.

01:14:15.917 --> 01:14:16.918
Aah!

01:14:16.918 --> 01:14:18.954
Ohh.

01:14:18.954 --> 01:14:21.156
Aah! Hardy!

01:14:21.156 --> 01:14:23.191
Hardy!

01:14:23.191 --> 01:14:24.092
Hardy! Hardy!

01:14:25.593 --> 01:14:27.362
Hardy, I killed
Mr. Peters,

01:14:27.362 --> 01:14:29.331
and I think
he's a murderer,

01:14:29.331 --> 01:14:32.000
and everything's
so horrible!

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:33.835
Hardy--

01:14:33.835 --> 01:14:35.003
Aaaah!

01:14:36.004 --> 01:14:37.038
Ohhh!

01:14:37.038 --> 01:14:41.409
He's dead, my dear,
just like the others.

01:14:41.409 --> 01:14:43.478
I didn't have time
to bag him.

01:14:43.478 --> 01:14:45.180
Miss Mumsley!

01:14:45.180 --> 01:14:47.983
Yes, Miss Mumsley.

01:14:47.983 --> 01:14:51.453
Do you think
I look good in green?

01:14:51.453 --> 01:14:53.121
Why, yes, I think
it's quite flattering.

01:14:55.090 --> 01:14:56.758
Thank you.

01:14:56.758 --> 01:14:58.326
Too bad
you have to die.

01:14:58.326 --> 01:14:59.794
You're the only one
of the girls

01:14:59.794 --> 01:15:01.730
who didn't
get laid first.

01:15:01.730 --> 01:15:03.196
Then you did it.

01:15:03.197 --> 01:15:05.033
I only kill
the boys.

01:15:05.033 --> 01:15:06.201
He killed the girls.

01:15:06.201 --> 01:15:07.335
It breaks up
the monotony.

01:15:07.335 --> 01:15:08.403
But why?

01:15:08.403 --> 01:15:09.705
Why not?
I never told him.

01:15:09.705 --> 01:15:10.838
He had no idea.

01:15:10.838 --> 01:15:12.441
I did it
to protect him

01:15:12.441 --> 01:15:14.409
in case there
were any witnesses.

01:15:14.409 --> 01:15:16.210
I don't understand.

01:15:16.211 --> 01:15:17.678
Because he was my son.

01:15:17.678 --> 01:15:19.214
You're his mother?!

01:15:19.214 --> 01:15:20.649
No, his father.

01:15:20.649 --> 01:15:22.583
Oh, my god!

01:15:22.583 --> 01:15:24.686
Father-mother.

01:15:24.686 --> 01:15:27.121
But why did you do it?

01:15:27.121 --> 01:15:29.124
Because I loved him.

01:15:30.892 --> 01:15:33.027
Listen,
please let me go and--

01:15:33.027 --> 01:15:35.363
and I won't tell anyone
you're crazy.

01:15:35.363 --> 01:15:36.164
I swear!

01:15:37.032 --> 01:15:39.033
Hold still
while I kill you.

01:15:39.033 --> 01:15:41.236
I'm an old woman
with arthritis.

01:16:18.073 --> 01:16:20.175
[horse whinnies]

01:16:21.276 --> 01:16:22.711
[horse nickers]

01:16:29.418 --> 01:16:31.286
[cackling laugh]

01:16:44.432 --> 01:16:45.233
Ohh!

01:16:46.434 --> 01:16:47.235
Hee hee hee!

01:16:48.703 --> 01:16:49.771
[creaks]

01:16:49.771 --> 01:16:52.808
[squeaking]

01:17:10.192 --> 01:17:12.227
[gorilla roars]

01:17:14.329 --> 01:17:16.397
Ha ha ha!

01:17:16.397 --> 01:17:19.267
[gunshot echoing]

01:17:23.337 --> 01:17:26.808
Aah!

01:17:31.512 --> 01:17:34.416
[all laughing]

01:17:46.360 --> 01:17:48.929
[monstrous roaring]

01:17:57.772 --> 01:18:00.374
This way out.

01:18:00.374 --> 01:18:03.010
Ohh!

01:18:03.011 --> 01:18:05.981
Aah!

01:18:09.351 --> 01:18:12.387
Toby, snap out of it.
Snap out of it, Toby.

01:18:12.387 --> 01:18:14.322
[gasps]

01:18:16.391 --> 01:18:17.959
Hardy?

01:18:19.394 --> 01:18:21.696
Julie.

01:18:21.696 --> 01:18:23.198
Bertha.

01:18:23.198 --> 01:18:26.268
Toby: Patti and Scott,
you're all alive!

01:18:26.268 --> 01:18:28.102
You're all alive and--

01:18:28.102 --> 01:18:31.806
and you're who you are
in real life.

01:18:31.806 --> 01:18:34.107
Oh, Mr. Dumpkin,
I had this dream and--

01:18:34.108 --> 01:18:36.044
and you weren't even
my French teacher!

01:18:36.044 --> 01:18:38.213
I will always be
your French teacher.

01:18:38.213 --> 01:18:40.982
But you were surrounded
by all these horse heads.

01:18:40.982 --> 01:18:42.216
<i>Qu'est-ce que c'est,
 a horse head?</i>

01:18:42.216 --> 01:18:44.218
You must've had
a terrible dream, no?

01:18:44.218 --> 01:18:46.454
A terrible dream?
It was a nightmare.

01:18:46.454 --> 01:18:48.356
Oh, this swine flu
really affected my mind.

01:18:50.459 --> 01:18:52.360
I--I dreamt that all
my friends were murdered

01:18:54.195 --> 01:18:55.862
because
they were having sex.

01:18:55.863 --> 01:18:58.232
Sounds reasonable.

01:18:58.232 --> 01:19:00.235
Toby: Mr. Mumsley,
you were a woman.

01:19:00.235 --> 01:19:03.137
And Mr. Peters,
you were the principal and--

01:19:03.137 --> 01:19:05.106
it's all due
to sexual repression

01:19:05.106 --> 01:19:06.840
and urban stress,
my dear.

01:19:06.841 --> 01:19:07.875
So who was the murderer?

01:19:07.875 --> 01:19:10.178
Luke, you can walk.

01:19:10.178 --> 01:19:12.146
Yeah, I have been
since I was 2 years old.

01:19:12.146 --> 01:19:14.715
And Mr. Malvert,
you were a janitor.

01:19:14.715 --> 01:19:16.150
Absurd!

01:19:16.150 --> 01:19:19.219
No, really,
I was at this prom and--

01:19:19.220 --> 01:19:21.556
and there was
this weird red punch.

01:19:21.556 --> 01:19:24.759
Sometimes,
Peters pee red.

01:19:24.759 --> 01:19:26.227
While you
were unconscious,

01:19:26.227 --> 01:19:29.964
we all felt so sorry
for you that, well,

01:19:29.964 --> 01:19:32.100
the gang voted you
prom queen.

01:19:32.100 --> 01:19:34.835
It was
Patti Priswell 's idea.

01:19:34.835 --> 01:19:37.739
But, Patti,
all through my dream

01:19:37.739 --> 01:19:39.674
all you wanted
was the crown.

01:19:39.674 --> 01:19:42.777
It's all I wanted
in my dreams, too.

01:19:42.777 --> 01:19:44.245
Will you put these
in water for me?

01:19:44.245 --> 01:19:45.279
Sure.

01:19:45.279 --> 01:19:48.283
In any event, people,
Toby needs her rest.

01:19:48.283 --> 01:19:50.452
We can all
visit her tomorrow.

01:19:50.452 --> 01:19:52.887
Don't forget your appointment
on Tuesday, my dear.

01:19:52.887 --> 01:19:55.257
Bye-bye.

01:19:58.927 --> 01:20:01.029
What was I like
in your dream?

01:20:01.029 --> 01:20:03.297
Well, besides me,

01:20:03.297 --> 01:20:05.500
you were the only one
who was normal.

01:20:05.500 --> 01:20:08.169
Yeah.
Boring, isn't it?

01:20:08.169 --> 01:20:09.603
Nope.

01:20:09.603 --> 01:20:12.374
Boring gets me hot.

01:20:21.315 --> 01:20:22.750
And I don't have
any more nightmares.

01:20:22.750 --> 01:20:23.985
Good.

01:20:23.985 --> 01:20:26.521
Dr. Sigmund told me
that sexual repression

01:20:26.521 --> 01:20:28.022
causes swine flu,

01:20:28.022 --> 01:20:29.791
so I think it's time
for me to do it.

01:20:29.791 --> 01:20:32.860
Here? Now?

01:20:32.860 --> 01:20:34.830
Ok.

01:20:48.876 --> 01:20:50.945
All I ask is that
you just turn your back

01:20:50.945 --> 01:20:54.748
while I undress, ok?

01:20:54.748 --> 01:20:56.617
Yes.

01:20:58.486 --> 01:21:02.424
And I 'll slip into
something more comfortable.

01:21:12.567 --> 01:21:14.870
[heavy breathing]

01:21:18.406 --> 01:21:21.208
Hardy.

01:21:21.208 --> 01:21:24.512
Hardy, what are you doing
with those rubber gloves on?

01:21:26.180 --> 01:21:28.550
Hardy, why are you
breathing so heavy?

01:21:28.550 --> 01:21:29.384
I'm the killer.

01:21:29.384 --> 01:21:31.119
Hardy, you're
not the killer.

01:21:31.119 --> 01:21:33.321
You're my friend,
remember?

01:21:33.321 --> 01:21:36.190
That was a dream.
This is reality.

01:21:36.190 --> 01:21:37.825
Why are you
doing this?

01:21:37.825 --> 01:21:39.393
I don't know.

01:21:39.393 --> 01:21:41.596
I guess I 'm just
that kind of guy!

01:21:41.596 --> 01:21:43.297
Aah! Aah!

01:21:43.297 --> 01:21:44.299
Uhh!

01:21:44.299 --> 01:21:46.434
Hardy, no!

01:21:49.036 --> 01:21:51.105
I know it's unusual
for a psychiatrist

01:21:51.105 --> 01:21:53.007
to speak at a funeral,

01:21:53.007 --> 01:21:55.343
but this was my client.

01:21:55.343 --> 01:21:56.544
The latest victim,
Toby Badger,

01:21:57.612 --> 01:21:59.113
just laid to rest.

01:21:59.113 --> 01:22:02.149
She suffered severe
social repression,

01:22:02.149 --> 01:22:03.551
countered by
an expressed nausea

01:22:04.819 --> 01:22:06.420
towards sex,

01:22:06.420 --> 01:22:09.056
which led to severe
social alienation

01:22:09.056 --> 01:22:11.258
causing huge
psychological problems,

01:22:11.258 --> 01:22:13.693
leading to the greatest
psychological problem

01:22:13.694 --> 01:22:14.562
of them all, death.

01:22:15.797 --> 01:22:18.598
Let us pay
our final respects,

01:22:18.599 --> 01:22:22.504
but the living must go on
and make a new beginning,

01:22:22.504 --> 01:22:25.507
hopefully in a spirit
of openness

01:22:25.507 --> 01:22:26.706
and sharing of grief,

01:22:26.707 --> 01:22:29.544
individually
or in groups.

01:22:29.544 --> 01:22:33.080
I'm sorry I had
to kill you, Toby.

01:22:33.080 --> 01:22:36.651
You just shouldn't
have done it.

01:22:36.651 --> 01:22:38.353
I lost respect,

01:22:38.353 --> 01:22:41.456
but I do
still love you.

01:22:41.456 --> 01:22:45.927
Others have only
brought you one flower,

01:22:45.927 --> 01:22:48.530
but I 've brought you 2.

01:22:48.530 --> 01:22:50.563
And if we should
ever meet again--

01:22:50.564 --> 01:22:51.900
Aah!

01:22:51.900 --> 01:22:54.201
[choking]

01:22:55.305 --> 01:23:01.396
