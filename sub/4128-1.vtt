00:01.000 --> 00:03.400
Our wedding.

00:04.480 --> 00:09.400
Yes Yes Yes.

00:21.280 --> 00:22.480
It's beautiful.

00:22.680 --> 00:24.680
Thanks. It's the
children's ward, so...

00:24.960 --> 00:27.080
...I wanted it to feel
happy and full of light.

00:27.560 --> 00:29.080
It's incredible. You nailed it.

00:32.680 --> 00:34.080
And now that
you're seeing Peter...

00:34.280 --> 00:35.880
...everything's coming
together for you.

00:36.080 --> 00:37.080
Maybe, maybe not.

00:37.480 --> 00:39.960
I'm still not 100% sure,
more importantly...

00:40.880 --> 00:42.960
I miss you so much.
I really wish we...

00:43.280 --> 00:44.680
...got to spend
more time together.

00:44.880 --> 00:46.080
Me too.

00:47.280 --> 00:48.280
Licorice?

00:48.560 --> 00:50.360
No, I have given up sugar.

00:51.160 --> 00:52.480
-Sugar now?
-Yes.

00:52.880 --> 00:54.960
So no caffeine, no gluten,
and now no sugar?

00:55.360 --> 00:58.160
Peter says that sugar is
"nature's sweetest poison."

00:58.760 --> 01:00.160
I know. I read the book.

01:00.560 --> 01:02.480
It's impossible to
live by all of his rules.

01:02.760 --> 01:04.160
Well, he feels
you need to shift...

01:04.560 --> 01:06.360
...your mind in order
to shift your body.

01:08.080 --> 01:10.360
I would give anything to
spend one day with you...

01:10.680 --> 01:12.480
...where we just threw
caution to the...

01:12.880 --> 01:15.160
...wind and lived in the moment
like when we were kids.

01:20.080 --> 01:22.160
-What's going on?
-I don't know.

01:28.760 --> 01:30.080
Poor guy.

01:40.430 --> 01:41.710
Jaclyn Palmer...

01:41.910 --> 01:44.830
Peter? What's happening?
Are you okay?

01:45.630 --> 01:49.830
Five months ago today
was a magical day. My book...

01:50.630 --> 01:51.830
...Happy Heart Health, hit...

01:52.310 --> 01:54.030
...the New York Times'
best-seller list...

01:54.430 --> 01:58.030
...and you came to design the new
addition to the children's wing.

01:59.830 --> 02:03.110
I met you, and it was
practically love at first sight.

02:04.310 --> 02:06.510
I believe you are
the sweetest, smartest...

02:07.910 --> 02:12.230
...prettiest woman
I'm ever going to meet.

02:13.630 --> 02:15.030
Thank you.

02:16.910 --> 02:19.310
The most romantic day
of the year is coming...

02:19.630 --> 02:21.110
...and I can't imagine
spending...

02:21.310 --> 02:23.030
...another day of my
life without you.

02:26.430 --> 02:28.030
Will you marry me?

02:30.430 --> 02:32.030
On Valentine's Day?

02:33.310 --> 02:34.430
Just... just a second.

02:35.710 --> 02:38.310
This Valentine's Day?
Like, a week from now?

02:38.710 --> 02:41.710
Yes, I... I mean... I believe
that when you decide...

02:42.030 --> 02:44.910
No. When you know
you're going to spend...

02:45.230 --> 02:46.830
...the rest of your life
with someone...

02:48.310 --> 02:50.230
...then what's
the point in waiting?

02:55.030 --> 02:56.430
Yes?

02:56.630 --> 02:58.110
You said "yes,"
but you weren't sure.

02:58.310 --> 03:00.230
I mean, you were ambushed,
you had to say yes.

03:00.430 --> 03:01.830
Well, I was surprised.

03:02.030 --> 03:05.510
Do you hear how your voice
goes up at the end? "Yes"?

03:05.710 --> 03:07.710
Like you're asking a question?

03:09.510 --> 03:11.110
Look. Peter's a great guy.

03:11.630 --> 03:13.630
Any woman would be
lucky to marry him.

03:14.030 --> 03:15.710
I agree! He's an amazing man.

03:15.910 --> 03:18.430
He's a handsome,
successful cardiologist...

03:18.630 --> 03:19.910
...with a best-selling book...

03:20.110 --> 03:21.910
...but you've only known
him five months.

03:22.110 --> 03:23.710
Well, sometimes, you just know.

03:24.030 --> 03:26.230
Did you know statistics
say married people are...

03:26.630 --> 03:28.830
...happier and healthier
than single people?

03:29.430 --> 03:31.710
So marriage actually
lowers cholesterol.

03:33.110 --> 03:34.430
Yeah, I read chapter six.

03:34.710 --> 03:36.310
"Marriage makes a heart
grow stronger."

03:36.510 --> 03:38.230
I love that chapter.

03:40.510 --> 03:42.310
This has nothing to do
with Peter wanting...

03:42.510 --> 03:44.630
...to be named the new
Chief of the hospital?

03:44.830 --> 03:48.430
No! Well, yes, it probably
looks good for him...

03:48.830 --> 03:51.110
...to be settled down and
married in order to be...

03:51.510 --> 03:52.910
...considered for
the position...

03:53.230 --> 03:55.630
We are up... to 920,000...

03:55.910 --> 03:57.630
...views in one week?

03:58.230 --> 03:59.510
Are you in love with him?

03:59.710 --> 04:01.110
Does he make your
heart skip a beat?

04:01.430 --> 04:02.630
Does your stomach do flips?

04:02.910 --> 04:04.710
Do your knees get weak
when you see him?

04:05.230 --> 04:06.630
Well, I certainly hope not!

04:06.830 --> 04:08.830
Those are the first symptoms
of cardiac arrest.

04:10.630 --> 04:12.510
Kate... look...

04:13.230 --> 04:16.310
...I have dated some
real losers and I am not...

04:16.829 --> 04:18.230
...getting any younger.
-So...

04:18.510 --> 04:19.910
...you're making
the safe choice.

04:20.630 --> 04:22.110
What's wrong with that?

04:22.910 --> 04:24.110
Nothing, I guess.

04:25.030 --> 04:26.830
But don't you want to
plan your wedding?

04:27.230 --> 04:29.510
Peter's mother has arranged
for a small family dinner...

04:29.710 --> 04:31.910
...at this hotel where his
family's been vacationing...

04:32.110 --> 04:33.110
...for years.

04:33.310 --> 04:36.630
-So just a small, tasteful affair?
-Exactly.

04:36.830 --> 04:38.310
Like that?

04:48.330 --> 04:51.330
I thought this day would never
come, but here you are!

04:54.210 --> 04:58.010
You are the luckiest
girl in the world!

04:58.610 --> 05:01.210
-And Peter's a very lucky man!
-Of course!

05:01.410 --> 05:04.410
Peter's lucky, too. The Chief
of the hospital and his wife,...

05:04.810 --> 05:08.810
...the architect!
Now that is a power couple.

05:09.210 --> 05:14.610
And you must be our maid
of honor? Jaclyn's sister...

05:15.130 --> 05:16.410
-Kate.
-Kate!

05:16.610 --> 05:17.610
And you are our...

05:17.930 --> 05:20.130
...photographer, right?
Now, I was thinking that...

05:20.410 --> 05:22.810
...you could sneak the
photographs to the L.A. Times...

05:23.130 --> 05:26.010
...and they could publish them in
their high-profile wedding issue!

05:26.730 --> 05:28.730
You know, this is
really all too much.

05:29.010 --> 05:31.130
I told her you might not
want all this hoopla, but...

05:31.330 --> 05:33.130
Of course she wants it!
What bride doesn't...

05:33.330 --> 05:35.530
...want a fairy-tale wedding?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

05:35.730 --> 05:37.130
Where's Peter?

05:37.330 --> 05:40.130
He's running. Now, this afternoon
you're gonna meet...

05:40.330 --> 05:43.130
...the rest of the family and then
tomorrow we're gonna have...

05:43.410 --> 05:46.810
...the wedding of my dreams
for you.

05:47.010 --> 05:49.530
Okay.
-Connie now, you come with me.

05:49.810 --> 05:52.130
There is a beautiful room
for the photographs...

05:52.410 --> 05:54.010
...and I think it will be just...

05:54.330 --> 05:55.330
Phillip!

06:00.530 --> 06:01.530
Honey!

06:02.410 --> 06:03.610
I hope you brought a hat.

06:03.930 --> 06:05.810
The sun is particularly
harsh this time of day.

06:06.210 --> 06:08.130
Peter, what is all of this?

06:10.930 --> 06:12.210
I tried to stop her, but...

06:12.530 --> 06:13.930
We talked about this.

06:14.130 --> 06:16.330
If I can't have time to plan
a wedding, then I just...

06:16.530 --> 06:18.530
...want something simple.
This isn't simple!

06:19.610 --> 06:21.330
This is...
I don't know what this is.

06:21.530 --> 06:23.330
Honey. You're right, okay?

06:23.930 --> 06:26.330
I'll talk to Mother and
get her to take it all down.

06:26.610 --> 06:28.130
Okay?
-Thank you.

06:28.530 --> 06:30.130
-I love you.
-I love you.

06:32.210 --> 06:34.330
Just that when she found
out how much I adored you...

06:34.530 --> 06:36.410
...she got a little excited
and went overboard.

06:36.610 --> 06:39.730
-I know. I'm sure she means well.
-She does.

06:39.930 --> 06:41.530
Why don't you go get rested up?

06:41.810 --> 06:45.010
I had them put that sparkling
water you love in your room.

06:45.530 --> 06:48.530
I am going to run two more miles
and then I'm gonna sit down...

06:48.730 --> 06:51.330
...with mother and tell her
to cancel everything.

06:53.110 --> 06:56.830
She will be devastated,
but she'll get over it.

06:59.110 --> 07:03.310
No. No. Don't do that.

07:04.430 --> 07:08.310
-Are you sure?
-Yes?

07:09.030 --> 07:12.110
You are the most thoughtful
person I know.

07:15.310 --> 07:18.510
Honey?
Only 300 steps today?

07:19.110 --> 07:20.910
I didn't have time to
run before the flight.

07:21.830 --> 07:24.630
Run for your heart, and
your heart will run for you.

07:32.030 --> 07:33.110
I like it.

07:33.430 --> 07:34.710
It's good, right?
-Yeah!

07:34.910 --> 07:36.430
Is that too corny
for a book title?

07:36.830 --> 07:39.110
No.
I think it's catchy.

07:39.310 --> 07:40.510
What would I do without you?

07:42.230 --> 07:43.510
I gotta go, I gotta go.
-Okay.

07:44.110 --> 07:45.430
Bye.

07:52.310 --> 07:53.910
Quick! What are
the first words that...

07:54.110 --> 07:56.110
...come to your mind
when you see this tent?

07:57.110 --> 08:00.110
I don't think that
I could put it into words.

08:00.310 --> 08:01.830
She could,
but she really shouldn't.

08:02.710 --> 08:05.230
A Valentine's dream.

08:05.910 --> 08:07.030
More like a nightmare.

08:07.230 --> 08:08.310
Mrs. Lorenzo...
-No.

08:08.630 --> 08:10.910
You must call me "Mama"
or "Mother" or "Mom,"...

08:11.230 --> 08:13.110
...whatever seems most
comfortable. Now, this...

08:13.310 --> 08:15.310
...is where the wedding
cake will go, and this...

08:15.510 --> 08:17.910
...is where you'll have your
first dance with Peter!

08:18.710 --> 08:20.230
Actually, I don't dance.

08:20.910 --> 08:23.110
At all. I'm...
I'm quite uncomfortable...

08:23.430 --> 08:24.830
She really doesn't.

08:25.030 --> 08:28.110
Not at her prom or at
birthday parties, weddings...

08:28.630 --> 08:30.030
You could skip the first dance...

08:30.230 --> 08:31.430
Nonsense!

08:31.630 --> 08:32.830
No, no, no, no, no.

08:33.110 --> 08:34.429
There's nothing to it.

08:34.710 --> 08:38.429
You just put your arms around
Peter's neck, and sway.

08:39.630 --> 08:41.710
I can't wait to show
you the bridal cabin.

08:42.510 --> 08:43.909
There's a bridal cabin?

08:48.130 --> 08:50.610
This is the bridal cabin.

08:51.810 --> 08:53.730
The hotel reserves it
for the bride and groom.

08:54.010 --> 08:55.930
I was lucky to get it
on such short notice!

08:56.530 --> 08:58.010
And I decorated it myself.

08:59.810 --> 09:01.210
So festive.

09:04.410 --> 09:06.210
Surprise!

09:07.210 --> 09:08.730
I know you didn't
have time to shop...

09:08.930 --> 09:10.610
...so I got it out of
storage and had it...

09:10.810 --> 09:12.930
...cleaned for you.
Believe it or not, I was about...

09:13.130 --> 09:14.410
...your size when I got married.

09:16.730 --> 09:17.810
I couldn't.

09:18.410 --> 09:21.210
I... I just brought
a simple white suit.

09:21.610 --> 09:25.130
This is a wedding!
You need a wedding dress!

09:29.130 --> 09:30.210
-What?
-Let's go.

09:30.410 --> 09:33.130
Let's give the bride a chance
to digest some of the...

09:33.410 --> 09:34.930
...special special-ness.

09:35.210 --> 09:36.730
You just relax, and try
that dress on!

09:36.930 --> 09:38.210
Okay.

09:43.730 --> 09:47.330
I want you to take some time
to think about this carefully.

09:49.210 --> 09:50.730
Is this really
what you want to do?

10:03.810 --> 10:06.730
Hi. Is there a bridal
store in town?

10:42.830 --> 10:44.030
Come on!

10:48.510 --> 10:49.830
Come on...

10:53.710 --> 10:55.310
You won't get cell
service out here.

10:58.110 --> 10:59.910
Thank you. I'm...

11:00.310 --> 11:01.910
...I'm... I'm just
looking for the town.

11:03.510 --> 11:05.030
It's that way about a mile.

11:05.830 --> 11:06.830
Great.

11:09.030 --> 11:10.030
And you're lucky.

11:10.230 --> 11:11.230
This time of day, the...

11:11.430 --> 11:13.710
...the bears are sleeping, so...
-Did you just say bears?

11:15.110 --> 11:16.310
I'm kidding.

11:17.230 --> 11:18.310
Good.

11:20.110 --> 11:21.430
Are you, you hurt?

11:25.430 --> 11:26.830
Here, let me have a look.
-Yeah...

11:27.030 --> 11:28.310
No! Thank you, no.I just...

11:28.510 --> 11:30.030
It's fine.
Just fell off the bike.

11:30.830 --> 11:31.830
I know first aid.

11:33.230 --> 11:34.830
What are you,
some kind of Boy Scout?

11:35.030 --> 11:36.430
Actually, yeah, I used to be.

11:36.830 --> 11:38.510
Great. Okay.

11:38.910 --> 11:41.310
I'm gonna go to town.

11:42.230 --> 11:44.230
I'll walk you. I'll make
sure you get there safe.

11:45.710 --> 11:46.710
You don't...

11:46.910 --> 11:48.310
You don't have to do that.

11:48.510 --> 11:50.030
Actually, I do have to do that.

11:50.230 --> 11:52.510
It's in the Boy Scout Handbook,
and I took the oath so...

11:53.230 --> 11:54.710
What about my bike? It's broken.

11:55.430 --> 11:58.510
Yeah, don't worry.
Bears don't ride bikes.

12:04.630 --> 12:05.910
It's so hot.

12:06.110 --> 12:09.310
Yeah, you know, we should really
be wearing sunscreen.

12:10.230 --> 12:11.510
Even with the tree cover...

12:11.830 --> 12:14.230
...the sun damage
this time of day...

12:26.830 --> 12:28.030
Why did you do that?

12:29.310 --> 12:30.510
What?

12:31.630 --> 12:32.830
Wha... That!

12:33.630 --> 12:35.110
I just wanted to
jump in the water.

12:35.510 --> 12:38.710
Well, that was a dangerous and
irresponsible thing to do!

12:39.910 --> 12:42.710
And do you always do the safe
and responsible thing?

12:43.110 --> 12:44.230
If you must know...

12:44.510 --> 12:46.310
...I don't like heights
and I don't swim.

12:46.910 --> 12:48.910
You don't trust yourself that
you'll be able to make the leap.

12:49.110 --> 12:50.830
You don't trust that
you'll be able to...

12:51.030 --> 12:52.510
...handle whatever might happen.

12:53.630 --> 12:54.710
That's complete nonsense.

12:58.430 --> 13:00.110
Clearly, you're
struggling with a decision.

13:00.310 --> 13:01.630
You're obviously preoccupied.

13:02.110 --> 13:03.230
You don't know that!

13:03.910 --> 13:05.030
This reminds me of a saying...

13:05.230 --> 13:07.030
...I heard once from
a wise old Italian woman...

13:07.430 --> 13:08.710
...and basically it
means you know...

13:09.030 --> 13:10.510
...a decision is
right when it feels...

13:10.910 --> 13:12.230
...like getting into a warm bath.

13:12.710 --> 13:14.110
Well, forgive me
if I don't want to...

13:14.430 --> 13:16.030
...discuss my personal
life with a stranger.

13:17.230 --> 13:18.510
That is precisely the reason...

13:18.710 --> 13:20.230
...why you should discuss
it with me.

13:20.430 --> 13:22.830
I'm a chance encounter with
a perfect stranger, whom...

13:23.030 --> 13:24.510
...you'll most likely
never see again.

13:24.710 --> 13:27.430
I'm in the unique position to offer
you unbiased, objective advice.

13:27.630 --> 13:29.830
You shouldn't eat those.
They might be poisonous.

13:30.230 --> 13:31.710
I hate to break it to you...

13:31.910 --> 13:34.510
...but you can do everything right
make all the right choices...

13:34.830 --> 13:36.230
...and still bad
things can happen.

13:37.630 --> 13:40.310
Well, thank you for all
of this stellar advice...

13:40.910 --> 13:42.430
...but I don't need
your help anymore.

13:46.110 --> 13:47.430
Which way do I go?

13:49.310 --> 13:50.910
Are you making this
decision because...

13:51.110 --> 13:53.310
...you think it's right or
because you feel it's right?

13:53.510 --> 13:55.630
Is it your heart or your head
telling you what to do?

13:56.430 --> 13:58.510
I met you an hour ago, and what?

13:59.430 --> 14:00.830
You think you know me?

14:01.510 --> 14:04.630
I... I know that you're...

14:04.830 --> 14:06.230
...you're thoughtful...

14:06.830 --> 14:10.030
...and... and kind...
and a little neurotic.

14:11.430 --> 14:13.430
Well, it's absolutely
arrogant to presume...

14:13.710 --> 14:15.430
...to know anything about me.

14:15.630 --> 14:17.630
Or my life!
Or...or any decis...

14:25.110 --> 14:26.510
Why did you do that?

14:28.230 --> 14:31.030
Impulse. I wanted to
see what would happen.

14:32.430 --> 14:36.230
Well, impulse is the lowest
form of human behavior.

14:37.110 --> 14:43.230
It's... impulsive, and...
immature and irresponsible.

14:45.430 --> 14:47.430
And I am very glad
I will never see you again.

14:54.630 --> 14:56.310
And another thing...

15:11.030 --> 15:13.230
There you are! Honey
where have you been?

15:13.510 --> 15:15.430
Mother and I have been
worried sick about you.

15:15.630 --> 15:17.030
What happened to your leg?

15:17.230 --> 15:20.030
I went for a bike ride in
the woods I fell off, I got lost.

15:20.630 --> 15:22.230
You poor thing.
Let me take a look.

15:23.310 --> 15:26.230
Surface abrasion. Well,
at least you got some exercise.

15:26.510 --> 15:28.830
I wanted to go into town to
look for a wedding dress.

15:29.030 --> 15:31.110
Mother said she's letting you
wear her wedding dress.

15:31.630 --> 15:34.030
Well, it's not exactly
my taste.

15:34.630 --> 15:36.430
Well, we don't want to
hurt her feelings.

15:40.430 --> 15:42.110
What about my feelings?

15:44.910 --> 15:46.430
Peter, does this seem
right to you?

15:47.430 --> 15:48.510
What?

15:48.830 --> 15:51.030
This! Us getting married
so fast.

15:51.830 --> 15:53.310
Are we making
this decision with...

15:53.510 --> 15:55.110
...our heads or our hearts?

15:55.310 --> 15:56.830
I don't understand
the question.

15:57.110 --> 15:59.110
Well, there's just so much
we haven't talked about.

15:59.310 --> 16:00.630
Like, where are
we going to live?

16:01.830 --> 16:03.110
Do we want to travel?

16:03.310 --> 16:04.710
Where do we want to
raise our kids?

16:08.110 --> 16:10.710
Kids? Do you want kids?

16:11.910 --> 16:14.030
I think so. Don't you?

16:15.910 --> 16:19.230
Look, we can discuss it.
If, in a few years...

16:19.710 --> 16:23.310
...you still want...
one, then we'll talk about it.

16:24.910 --> 16:26.910
We love each other,
and there is nothing...

16:27.710 --> 16:30.830
...we can't work through.
I just want you to be happy.

16:32.030 --> 16:33.310
That's so sweet.

16:35.230 --> 16:36.830
I think marrying
you is going to be...

16:37.110 --> 16:38.710
...the smartest decision
I've ever made.

16:46.910 --> 16:49.310
So then this scruffy
mountain man...

16:49.510 --> 16:51.310
...comes out of the
woods and tells me...

16:51.510 --> 16:53.110
...I need to abandon all
my decisions...

16:53.310 --> 16:55.030
...because I'm too responsible!

16:56.110 --> 16:58.110
How can you be
"too responsible"?

16:59.110 --> 17:00.630
Sounds like he really gets you.

17:01.910 --> 17:04.829
He eats poisonous berries
and jumps off cliffs...

17:05.230 --> 17:07.910
...but he thinks he can tell me
how to live my life.

17:08.230 --> 17:09.630
Okay, calm down. He's gone.

17:09.910 --> 17:11.630
You're never gonna
have to see him again.

17:11.829 --> 17:13.430
Well, I hope not,
because I would run...

17:13.630 --> 17:15.030
...the other way
as fast as I could.

17:15.230 --> 17:17.510
I would never give him a
chance to kiss me ever again.

17:17.710 --> 17:20.910
I'm sorry. You kissed him?

17:22.109 --> 17:26.109
No! No. He kissed me.
I didn't kiss him back.

17:26.829 --> 17:29.630
Okay, I mean, I did, but only
because I was so shocked!

17:30.030 --> 17:31.030
You're blushing!

17:31.230 --> 17:32.230
No, I'm not! I am...

17:32.510 --> 17:36.110
...hot in here, and I feel
outraged and indignant.

17:37.110 --> 17:38.510
Or in love.

17:44.030 --> 17:46.630
I met Jaclyn when she was
designing the new addition to...

17:46.830 --> 17:48.630
...the children's
wing at the hospital.

17:48.830 --> 17:50.710
She was the smartest
woman I'd ever dated...

17:52.310 --> 17:54.630
...and now that she's
running and eating right...

17:54.830 --> 17:56.430
...she's also one
of the healthiest.

17:57.030 --> 17:58.030
Well...

17:58.230 --> 18:01.310
You see, she shifted her
mind to shift her body.

18:02.830 --> 18:05.310
And Peter had just
returned from Africa...

18:05.830 --> 18:08.430
...where he was doing
heart surgeries on children.

18:09.230 --> 18:10.430
I was so impressed. I mean...

18:10.630 --> 18:12.630
...I guess I just couldn't
help but fall in love.

18:16.830 --> 18:20.030
Max! I'm really
glad you're here!

18:20.710 --> 18:22.310
I knew you'd make it!

18:24.430 --> 18:27.630
Jaclyn, this is my little
brother and best man...

18:28.430 --> 18:29.710
...Max.

18:33.710 --> 18:37.310
Max, this is Jaclyn.
She's my bride.

18:38.830 --> 18:40.030
It's a pleasure to meet you.

18:40.230 --> 18:43.110
It's so nice to meet you.
For the first time. Ever.

18:43.510 --> 18:45.430
Well, don't be shy!
Come on in there.

18:46.310 --> 18:48.630
Give her a hug. She's gonna
be your new sister-in-law.

18:52.710 --> 18:54.430
You know I never
thought you'd make it.

18:54.630 --> 18:56.310
I sent word, but had
no idea if you were...

18:56.510 --> 18:58.830
...receiving messages in the
jungle, or wherever you were.

18:59.030 --> 19:00.310
You know I'd never miss this.

19:00.830 --> 19:04.230
Okay. Okay,
Max is a pediatrician living...

19:04.510 --> 19:07.710
...and working in Africa.
He travels from city to city...

19:08.510 --> 19:11.110
...taking care of sick children.
That's why I was there.

19:12.710 --> 19:14.630
That's so interesting.
I'm gonna go to the bar.

19:15.030 --> 19:17.910
Yes, he's chosen to use
his Harvard education...

19:19.230 --> 19:22.830
...as an unknown,
poor humanitarian.

19:23.110 --> 19:24.510
Who does such a thing?

19:24.830 --> 19:26.230
It's good to see you too, Mom.

19:28.430 --> 19:29.910
Papa.

19:43.110 --> 19:45.310
Why didn't you tell me
who you were?

19:45.510 --> 19:47.510
I thought you were just
some guy living in the woods!

19:47.710 --> 19:49.710
Why didn't you tell me you
were my brother's fiancée?

19:49.910 --> 19:51.030
Is that what you were
trying to decide?

19:51.230 --> 19:52.310
Whether or not to marry him?

19:52.510 --> 19:54.430
No! Not at all.
That is the one thing...

19:54.630 --> 19:57.110
...that I am absolutely
completely sure of.

19:57.510 --> 19:59.230
You didn't seem so sure
when you kissed me.

19:59.510 --> 20:01.230
I didn't kiss you!
You kissed me.

20:01.510 --> 20:02.830
Nonna.

20:03.030 --> 20:05.310
Questa la mia nonna.
My grandmother, Nonna Rosa.

20:06.430 --> 20:09.510
You make a lovely couple.

20:10.830 --> 20:11.830
No, Nonna.

20:12.230 --> 20:13.430
No, Grandma.

20:17.430 --> 20:20.310
They aren't getting married.
We are getting married!

20:20.630 --> 20:21.830
Ma! Ma. Mom.

20:22.110 --> 20:24.230
She just said
congratulations in Italian.

20:25.110 --> 20:26.230
Thank you!

20:28.230 --> 20:30.430
Well, I'm just exhausted and...

20:30.910 --> 20:33.030
...we have a really
long day tomorrow...

20:33.230 --> 20:35.310
...so I'm going to
go to the bridal cabin...

20:35.630 --> 20:36.830
...and get my beauty sleep.

20:37.310 --> 20:38.830
I'll walk you back.
-No, no it's fine.

20:39.030 --> 20:40.910
Just, stay, enjoy your family.
-Okay.

20:44.630 --> 20:45.630
I'll walk her back.

20:45.910 --> 20:47.430
-Great.
-Yeah.

20:53.510 --> 20:56.510
Well... It's good to
see you, man.

20:56.910 --> 20:58.310
You didn't give me much notice.

20:59.310 --> 21:00.710
What's really going on?

21:01.830 --> 21:02.830
Look...

21:03.110 --> 21:06.630
...writing a New York Times
best-seller is great, but...

21:07.630 --> 21:09.310
...they're never gonna
appoint me chief...

21:09.510 --> 21:12.110
...of the hospital unless
I have a stable, settled life.

21:13.630 --> 21:16.110
And since when do you want
to be chief of the hospital?

21:16.310 --> 21:18.110
That's never what
you wanted to do.

21:18.430 --> 21:19.910
That's what
Mom wanted for you.

21:24.630 --> 21:26.310
What just happened in
there? Are you okay?

21:26.510 --> 21:27.510
I'm fine.

21:27.830 --> 21:29.430
You are clearly not fine.
What happened?

21:29.830 --> 21:32.310
Okay. You know Peter's brother?

21:33.510 --> 21:35.630
Max, the gorgeous
single doctor?

21:36.110 --> 21:37.230
Well...

21:37.510 --> 21:38.630
I've met him before.

21:39.030 --> 21:40.230
When?

21:42.230 --> 21:44.430
He's the scruffy guy you
kissed in the woods?

21:45.510 --> 21:47.030
He cleans up really well!

21:48.830 --> 21:51.430
So you kissed him?
You kissed Peter's brother?

21:51.830 --> 21:53.230
Can you please
stop saying that?

21:53.510 --> 21:55.430
Number one, I didn't know
he was his brother...

21:55.630 --> 21:57.630
...and number two, I didn't
kiss him, he kissed me.

21:58.030 --> 22:01.830
Okay, relax. So?
What are you going to do?

22:03.710 --> 22:07.030
Do? Nothing.
Now that I've met Max...

22:07.310 --> 22:09.630
...I'm more sure than ever
that I want to marry Peter.

22:10.310 --> 22:14.510
Peter is... predictable,
and safe and reliable.

22:15.230 --> 22:16.710
That is exactly
what I want in a man.

22:17.230 --> 22:20.710
Really? That's exactly what
I want in a vacuum cleaner.

22:24.230 --> 22:27.030
Jaclyn, just do one
thing for me. Okay?

22:28.230 --> 22:29.710
When you wake up
tomorrow morning...

22:29.910 --> 22:33.030
...ask yourself if this is the
happiest day of your life.

22:34.230 --> 22:36.030
Is Peter your one true love?

22:37.430 --> 22:39.030
If you can say yes to
those questions...

22:39.230 --> 22:41.830
...I will support you
100%. If not...

22:43.230 --> 22:44.830
...you need to stop
this wedding.

22:45.910 --> 22:47.630
You don't get a do-over.

22:51.110 --> 22:55.030
Sweetie... I promise you,
I will not want a do-over.

22:55.710 --> 22:57.830
Just... be sure.

22:59.830 --> 23:01.110
-Okay.
-Okay.

23:01.510 --> 23:03.230
-See you tomorrow.
-See you.

23:13.030 --> 23:17.710
A do-over. I definitely
will not want a do-over.

23:34.310 --> 23:35.630
Hello?
-Good morning.

23:36.030 --> 23:37.230
This is your wake-up call.

23:37.710 --> 23:39.110
Thank you.

23:49.030 --> 23:51.910
Is this the happiest
day of my life?

23:54.030 --> 23:55.230
Good morning!

23:55.430 --> 23:58.430
Welcome to our wedding
day! Time to get at it!

23:58.910 --> 24:01.830
This is Kenneth, and that's
Gerry, and they are...

24:02.230 --> 24:06.630
...going to transform you
into Cinderella.

24:06.910 --> 24:08.110
I'm leaving you in good hands.

24:08.430 --> 24:10.030
We have a lot to do
before the wedding.

24:10.230 --> 24:11.510
Kate!

24:13.030 --> 24:14.630
I don't know what to say.

24:15.230 --> 24:16.630
Don't say anything.

24:17.310 --> 24:19.230
You are already getting ready?

24:20.430 --> 24:22.830
So I guess that means
you've made your decision?

24:24.110 --> 24:25.230
I have.

24:27.110 --> 24:29.030
Well, then let's get
you married.

24:31.110 --> 24:32.430
Can't you see
where you're going?

24:32.710 --> 24:33.910
What's the matter with you?

24:37.830 --> 24:39.630
This is... just...

24:40.230 --> 24:41.510
...so...

24:42.110 --> 24:44.110
...so "wow."

24:44.430 --> 24:46.430
Margaret really wants me to
wear her wedding dress.

24:46.630 --> 24:49.630
It's so important to her.
I just feel like I can't say no.

24:51.030 --> 24:52.230
Yes, you can.

24:54.030 --> 24:55.230
It's your wedding day.

24:56.910 --> 25:00.430
It is. It's my wedding day.

26:23.710 --> 26:26.710
Friends and family we are
gathered here today to join...

26:27.230 --> 26:30.430
...this man and this
woman in holy matrimony.

26:32.030 --> 26:34.430
Marriage is forever and ever.

26:36.310 --> 26:37.710
It lasts a lifetime and binds...

26:38.030 --> 26:39.830
...two people
together for eternity.

26:41.510 --> 26:44.430
Do you take this woman to be
your lawfully wedded wife,...

26:44.630 --> 26:47.030
...to have and to hold
forever and ever?

26:48.830 --> 26:50.030
I do.

26:50.430 --> 26:52.030
And do you, Jaclyn,
take this man...

26:52.230 --> 26:53.910
...to be your lawfully
wedded husband...

26:54.110 --> 26:56.030
...to have and to hold,
forever and ever?

26:56.510 --> 26:58.030
I do?

27:00.510 --> 27:02.110
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

27:02.910 --> 27:04.310
You may kiss the bride.

27:32.510 --> 27:34.710
All right, ladies and gentlemen,
it's about that time.

27:34.910 --> 27:36.510
It is my privilege to
present to you...

27:37.310 --> 27:41.510
...the new Dr. and
Mrs Peter Lorenzo.

27:41.830 --> 27:43.230
Let 'em feel it! All right.

27:48.310 --> 27:49.310
Son!

27:50.510 --> 27:51.830
Here, grab yourself a drink.

27:53.430 --> 27:54.630
Honey!

27:55.910 --> 27:57.030
Are you okay?

27:58.710 --> 28:00.110
Luckily you saved her.

28:03.510 --> 28:05.310
That will never come out.

28:07.310 --> 28:09.030
The newlyweds will
now go to the dance...

28:09.230 --> 28:10.630
...floor for their
first dance as...

28:10.830 --> 28:12.510
...husband and wife.
-Great.

28:19.030 --> 28:20.430
Thank you.

28:25.030 --> 28:26.230
So sweet.

28:27.230 --> 28:28.910
-Hang on and move your feet.
-Okay.

28:29.430 --> 28:31.030
My mother made my
brother and I take...

28:31.230 --> 28:33.030
...six years of dance lessons,
so just follow me.

28:33.230 --> 28:34.510
-Okay.
-Okay.

28:35.030 --> 28:38.510
Okay, now family only join
them on the dance floor.

29:01.630 --> 29:02.830
Okay.

29:06.510 --> 29:07.830
So much fun.

29:09.430 --> 29:11.030
Is this what you wanted?

29:12.230 --> 29:15.830
Yes. Yes. This is exactly
what I wanted. I'm so happy.

29:17.710 --> 29:21.910
Well, then I am really
happy for you.

29:23.910 --> 29:25.310
Thank you.

29:53.630 --> 29:55.710
When I got the message
to come home and attend...

29:56.110 --> 29:58.230
...my brother's wedding,
I was surprised.

29:59.630 --> 30:01.110
Why were they
getting married after...

30:01.310 --> 30:02.510
...knowing each other for...

30:02.710 --> 30:05.830
...less than a year?
And then I met Jaclyn.

30:08.230 --> 30:13.030
She is beautiful and
intelligent, and...

30:13.430 --> 30:15.830
...when she smiles,
the whole room lights up.

30:21.230 --> 30:24.230
A toast to the happy couple.
-The happy couple.

30:24.830 --> 30:25.910
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

30:26.310 --> 30:27.830
Cheers, congratulations.

30:28.310 --> 30:30.030
I love you.
-I love you, too.

30:34.830 --> 30:37.830
One... two... three!

30:56.430 --> 30:58.630
I think I'll stretch out under
the stars for a while.

30:59.510 --> 31:00.710
Now?

31:02.830 --> 31:04.310
Look at that sky.

31:05.030 --> 31:06.830
I just have to take
this in a minute.

31:15.910 --> 31:17.910
Was this the happiest
day of my life?

31:21.830 --> 31:23.830
I wish I could have a do-over.

31:50.630 --> 31:51.910
Hello?
-Good morning.

31:52.230 --> 31:53.510
This is your wake-up call.

31:54.030 --> 31:56.030
I didn't ask for
another wake-up call.

31:59.510 --> 32:00.830
Peter?

32:02.630 --> 32:04.110
Where are you?

32:07.310 --> 32:08.830
How did they get the wine out?

32:10.030 --> 32:13.630
Good morning!
Welcome to our wedding day!

32:13.910 --> 32:14.910
Time to get at it!

32:15.230 --> 32:17.710
This is Kenneth, and that's
Gerry, and they are...

32:18.030 --> 32:19.830
...going to transform you...

32:20.910 --> 32:22.430
...into Cinderella.

32:25.430 --> 32:26.430
-I...
-Don't worry.

32:26.710 --> 32:28.630
They're going to do
a stunning smoky eye.

32:29.310 --> 32:30.310
What's going on?

32:30.630 --> 32:32.230
You are going to
be a beautiful bride.

32:32.830 --> 32:35.430
-But I already got married.
-You've been married before?

32:36.230 --> 32:38.110
Does Peter know?
You got divorced, didn't you?

32:38.430 --> 32:39.710
Seriously, what's going on?

32:44.030 --> 32:46.710
Kate!
-Don't say anything.

32:48.230 --> 32:49.510
You're already getting ready?

32:49.830 --> 32:51.830
So I guess you've
made your decision.

32:52.710 --> 32:54.030
You already said that.

32:54.310 --> 32:56.030
I already heard you say that...

32:56.230 --> 32:58.510
...and why are you still wearing
that hideous dress?

32:58.710 --> 33:00.110
"Hideous"?

33:01.310 --> 33:02.630
What... what day is it?

33:04.230 --> 33:05.310
It's February 14th.

33:06.230 --> 33:08.110
We already had February 14th.

33:08.830 --> 33:09.910
Are you okay?

33:11.910 --> 33:13.110
Is this a do-over?

33:13.830 --> 33:15.030
Are all of you in on this?

33:16.110 --> 33:17.310
A what?

33:18.510 --> 33:20.030
Can't you see
where you're going?

33:20.230 --> 33:22.030
That! I knew that
was gonna happen.

33:22.430 --> 33:23.630
He did that yesterday.

33:23.910 --> 33:25.310
Then they should fire that guy.

33:25.510 --> 33:26.830
No, you don't understand.

33:27.030 --> 33:29.030
All of this happened yesterday.

33:29.310 --> 33:31.630
You were here. You were
here. You came in.

33:32.030 --> 33:34.710
He dropped his golf clubs,
and then I got married!

33:35.710 --> 33:37.510
Yesterday, when she
got lost in the woods...

33:37.830 --> 33:39.110
...and fell and hurt her leg...

33:39.310 --> 33:40.630
...maybe she hit her head, too?

33:40.830 --> 33:43.430
Maybe she has a concussion.
I'm calling a doctor.

33:43.830 --> 33:46.110
I don't need a doctor!
I need to know what's going on.

33:46.710 --> 33:48.710
What's going on? Wh...

33:53.630 --> 33:54.830
Maybe this is a dream.

33:57.310 --> 33:58.710
You're scaring me.

33:59.030 --> 34:00.430
Has your sister
ever been treated...

34:01.630 --> 34:03.310
...for mental health issues?

34:03.710 --> 34:04.710
Everyone, out!

34:04.910 --> 34:07.110
Let's go. I need to
take care of my sister...

34:07.430 --> 34:09.310
...'cause she's obviously
experiencing...

34:09.510 --> 34:11.030
...some kind of
bridal delusion.

34:11.630 --> 34:13.429
-But, Kate, I...
-No, no...

34:13.630 --> 34:15.230
...you have got to
get out of here now.

34:16.310 --> 34:17.630
Okay, you believe me, right?

34:18.429 --> 34:19.510
Of course I believe you.

34:19.830 --> 34:21.830
I'm just glad you finally
came to your senses!

34:23.030 --> 34:24.710
I say we leave now.

34:25.310 --> 34:27.110
You can call Peter
from the airport...

34:28.310 --> 34:30.230
...and explain that
you changed your mind.

34:30.909 --> 34:32.830
No, Kate, I'm not trying to
get out of the wedding.

34:33.030 --> 34:35.110
I'm telling you,
I already lived this day.

34:35.830 --> 34:36.909
Let's just get home and...

34:37.110 --> 34:39.310
...we can talk about it over
a nice hot cup of tea.

34:39.510 --> 34:41.510
I can't go home with you.
I got married yesterday!

34:42.630 --> 34:44.710
And when I say "cup of tea,"
I mean bottle of wine.

34:47.510 --> 34:49.110
What if I dreamed it?

34:50.110 --> 34:52.630
Okay, so
what if this is real...

34:52.909 --> 34:55.510
...but last night, I dreamed
something very nearly...

34:56.429 --> 34:58.710
...pretty much
exactly like this.

34:59.910 --> 35:00.910
It doesn't matter.

35:01.230 --> 35:02.830
Either way,
I'm getting you out of here.

35:03.310 --> 35:04.430
Let's go.
-No.

35:05.310 --> 35:07.510
No. I can't hurt Peter.

35:07.830 --> 35:09.710
I can't just leave him
at the altar because...

35:09.910 --> 35:12.430
...I'm having some
kind of déjà vu moment.

35:12.830 --> 35:14.910
He's chosen to spend his
life with me and I said yes.

35:16.030 --> 35:17.830
But maybe you don't
want to get married.

35:18.910 --> 35:20.630
He is a wonderful man.

35:22.310 --> 35:24.630
And his whole
family's here today...

35:26.030 --> 35:27.910
...and I'm going to
get married today.

35:51.310 --> 35:52.510
Friends and family, we are...

35:52.710 --> 35:54.510
...gathered here today
to join this man...

35:54.710 --> 35:57.030
...and this woman in
holy matrimony.

35:58.030 --> 35:59.830
Marriage is forever and ever.

36:00.910 --> 36:05.430
It lasts a lifetime and binds
two people together for eternity.

36:06.830 --> 36:09.710
Do you, Peter, take
this woman to be your...

36:10.110 --> 36:12.430
...lawfully wedded wife
to have and to hold...

36:12.710 --> 36:14.110
...forever and ever?

36:15.310 --> 36:16.630
I do.

36:17.910 --> 36:20.030
And do you, Jaclyn,
take this man to be your...

36:20.430 --> 36:21.710
...lawfully wedded husband...

36:22.030 --> 36:23.710
...to have and to hold,
forever and ever?

36:24.310 --> 36:26.230
I do. Again.

36:27.630 --> 36:29.230
I now pronounce
you man and wife.

36:29.910 --> 36:31.030
You may kiss the bride.

36:43.710 --> 36:44.910
My baby.

36:50.030 --> 36:52.230
All right, ladies and gentlemen,
it's about that time.

36:52.430 --> 36:55.230
It is my privilege to
present to you the new...

36:55.910 --> 36:58.830
...Dr. and Mrs. Peter Lorenzo.

36:59.110 --> 37:00.630
Let 'em feel it! All right.

37:03.430 --> 37:05.430
Son!

37:06.910 --> 37:08.510
Here, grab yourself a drink.

37:10.430 --> 37:12.110
That will never come out!

37:12.910 --> 37:14.110
It might.

37:14.310 --> 37:16.310
The newlyweds will now
go to the dance floor...

37:16.510 --> 37:18.830
...for their first dance as
husband and wife. All right.

37:24.510 --> 37:26.030
Thanks.

37:28.910 --> 37:30.110
-You all right?
-Yep.

37:30.310 --> 37:31.310
-Careful.
-Great.

37:31.910 --> 37:34.510
Just move your feet
and hold on.

37:34.710 --> 37:36.030
My mother made my brother
and I take six years...

37:36.230 --> 37:37.510
Brother and you take six
years of dance lessons...

37:37.830 --> 37:39.230
...so I'll just follow you.
-How did you know that?

37:39.430 --> 37:40.430
You told me yesterday.

37:40.630 --> 37:41.830
-I did?
-Yep.

37:43.030 --> 37:44.430
Okay, now family only...

37:46.230 --> 37:47.710
...join them on
the dance floor.

37:55.230 --> 37:56.510
-Excuse me.
-Okay.

38:08.830 --> 38:09.910
Everything okay?

38:10.430 --> 38:12.710
Not really. I think I
might be going insane.

38:15.030 --> 38:16.230
Is there anything I can do?

38:16.510 --> 38:19.430
Nope. I just really want
this day to be over.

38:20.430 --> 38:21.910
Again.

38:34.510 --> 38:36.110
-Smile.
-Okay.

38:52.910 --> 38:54.910
When I got the message
to come home...

38:55.230 --> 38:57.910
...and attend my brother's
wedding I was surprised.

38:58.630 --> 39:00.030
Why would they be
getting married...

39:00.310 --> 39:02.510
...after knowing each other
for less than a year.

39:02.630 --> 39:03.830
And then I met Jaclyn...

39:04.710 --> 39:07.230
Thank you, all,
thank you, all...

39:07.430 --> 39:10.630
...for coming to our wedding
but it's our wedding night and...

39:10.910 --> 39:13.510
...we are very anxious
to go to bed.

39:14.310 --> 39:15.430
To sleep.

39:18.230 --> 39:22.910
Okay what I'm trying to say is
we need to go to our room so...

39:23.230 --> 39:25.110
...this day can finally end.

39:28.430 --> 39:30.830
So that we can look back
on our wedding day...

39:31.110 --> 39:33.030
...and be so happy that
we got married.

39:34.710 --> 39:36.110
-What?
-Please.

39:40.310 --> 39:41.310
This dress!

39:41.710 --> 39:43.710
We really should stay and
spend time with our guests.

39:43.910 --> 39:45.630
The bride and groom.
The bride and groom.

39:45.830 --> 39:47.310
The bride and groom.

39:59.630 --> 40:02.030
I think I'll go stretch out
under the stars for a while.

40:02.230 --> 40:03.310
Again?

40:04.830 --> 40:06.110
I could skip it.

40:06.310 --> 40:07.630
No, no, no, no, it's fine.

40:07.910 --> 40:09.510
Last night, you went
out on the porch...

40:09.710 --> 40:11.030
...and then
I went to bed alone.

40:31.510 --> 40:33.630
Please let this
day end forever.

40:47.430 --> 40:48.830
Hello?
-Good morning.

40:49.110 --> 40:50.310
This is your wake-up call.

41:06.310 --> 41:07.430
Good morning!

41:07.710 --> 41:11.310
Welcome to our wedding
day! Time to get at it!

41:11.710 --> 41:13.710
This is Kenneth and that's
Gerry, and they are...

41:15.110 --> 41:19.510
...going to transform you
into Cinderella.

41:27.030 --> 41:28.830
Well, she fell off her
bike yesterday and...

41:29.030 --> 41:31.310
...might have hit her head.
I think she has a concussion.

41:31.630 --> 41:34.830
-Maybe she's on drugs.
-I'm right here.

41:35.110 --> 41:37.110
I don't have a concussion
and I'm not on drugs.

41:37.630 --> 41:39.230
She recently gave up
sugar, caffeine...

41:39.430 --> 41:41.510
...and gluten, so she
could be hallucinating?

41:41.910 --> 41:43.910
Perhaps you should
all give us some space.

41:48.630 --> 41:52.430
I love you, honey. Remember,
for better or for worse.

41:53.630 --> 41:54.710
Okay?

41:56.030 --> 41:57.430
For better or worse.

42:02.230 --> 42:05.030
So... what's really
going on here?

42:05.510 --> 42:07.310
Well, there's nothing
wrong with me.

42:07.710 --> 42:09.230
I can see that.
You're perfectly fine.

42:09.430 --> 42:12.030
So why am I here? Cold feet?

42:13.430 --> 42:16.110
No! I'm not trying to
get out of the wedding.

42:16.430 --> 42:19.830
I am living the same day over
and over and over again.

42:20.030 --> 42:21.910
Every morning, I wake up,
it's February 14th...

42:22.230 --> 42:23.310
...and I'm getting married.

42:23.630 --> 42:24.830
I've seen this before.

42:25.310 --> 42:28.430
Are you serious?
Thank heaven.

42:29.110 --> 42:30.310
What do I do I fix it?

42:30.630 --> 42:32.710
Well, you're under a lot of stress
that causes anxiety.

42:32.910 --> 42:34.630
I'm gonna put you on
a mild antidepressant.

42:34.830 --> 42:36.510
No! No, no, no.
I don't have anxiety.

42:36.710 --> 42:38.430
I... Okay, well, yes, I do...

42:38.630 --> 42:40.230
...but it's not because
of the wedding...

42:40.430 --> 42:42.110
...it's because I am
living the same day...

42:42.310 --> 42:43.630
...again and again and again.

42:48.830 --> 42:51.910
-All right. Who's calling me?
-I don't know.

42:53.630 --> 42:55.030
Now you have a
credibility problem.

42:55.710 --> 42:57.230
If you were living the same day
again and again and again.

42:57.430 --> 42:58.630
You would know who's calling me.

42:58.830 --> 43:00.510
No, I wouldn't, because
that's not how it works.

43:00.710 --> 43:02.710
Every day's different.
I've never met you before.

43:03.910 --> 43:08.230
So you're living the same day
but it's different?

43:09.310 --> 43:13.310
-That's what I'm saying.
-That's what you're saying?

43:14.230 --> 43:15.710
I asked for a do-over.

43:16.710 --> 43:18.510
I just didn't think it
would actually happen.

43:19.030 --> 43:22.030
-A "do-over"?
-Yeah.

43:24.830 --> 43:25.910
I'm going to be right back.

43:32.430 --> 43:33.430
How's it going?

43:33.630 --> 43:35.430
She has to be in hair
and makeup by 12:00.

43:35.830 --> 43:37.430
I'm going to get
her tested for drugs.

43:38.030 --> 43:39.110
I'm still here.

43:46.430 --> 43:47.710
You okay?

43:49.230 --> 43:50.430
What are you doing here?

43:50.710 --> 43:53.030
Well, rumor has that you
went a little off the rails.

43:54.430 --> 43:55.510
Can you get me out of here?

43:57.230 --> 43:59.630
-Yeah.
-Okay, good, let's go! Come on.

44:05.630 --> 44:08.010
So if I get what you're saying
you're stuck in some kind of...

44:08.110 --> 44:09.630
...cosmic loop and you keep
living the same day...

44:09.930 --> 44:11.910
...over and over again?
How long?

44:12.810 --> 44:14.330
This is day four...

44:14.710 --> 44:18.230
I think. I don't even
care if you believe me.

44:20.310 --> 44:21.510
Well, I do believe you.

44:22.430 --> 44:23.710
You really do?

44:24.630 --> 44:26.110
I have no evidence
to the contrary.

44:29.610 --> 44:31.330
In the villages
I work in, in Africa...

44:31.530 --> 44:33.210
...they believe that
there is a whole...

44:33.410 --> 44:35.410
...world going on around
us that we don't see.

44:37.010 --> 44:38.330
And we're given clues that...

44:38.530 --> 44:40.210
...guide us in our
everyday lives.

44:41.210 --> 44:42.610
Some clues are harder
to understand.

44:44.130 --> 44:45.130
Maybe you're right.

44:45.330 --> 44:46.930
Maybe I'm in some
kind of cosmic loop...

44:47.630 --> 44:49.430
...and I just need
to break the cycle.

44:53.630 --> 44:54.710
Stay with me here tonight.

44:57.510 --> 44:59.510
Maybe if I never go
back to my room...

44:59.710 --> 45:02.030
...then the whole day
can't start all over again.

45:03.510 --> 45:05.430
Yeah, but if I stay
with you here all day...

45:05.630 --> 45:07.130
...you're going to
miss your wedding...

45:07.130 --> 45:08.810
...and my brother's
going to be heartbroken.

45:09.010 --> 45:10.610
Look, I already married
him several times.

45:10.810 --> 45:11.930
I'm not gonna do it again.

45:12.130 --> 45:13.730
So stay with me or
don't stay with me...

45:13.930 --> 45:15.010
...but I'm not going back.

45:15.530 --> 45:16.810
Peter loves you, and this is...

45:17.130 --> 45:18.130
Okay. Okay. Fine.

45:18.410 --> 45:20.410
If this doesn't work and
I can't break the cycle...

45:20.610 --> 45:22.130
...I'll marry him
again tomorrow.

45:23.330 --> 45:24.530
Okay.

45:27.730 --> 45:29.130
So we're stuck here all day?

45:32.530 --> 45:34.010
Might as well make
the most of it.

45:34.810 --> 45:36.930
I'm gonna help you get over
your fear of swimming.

45:38.330 --> 45:41.130
I don't have a fear of swimming
I have a fear of drowning.

45:42.530 --> 45:44.410
Have you ever heard
of immersion therapy?

45:44.730 --> 45:46.210
It's where you take
the person and expose...

45:46.610 --> 45:48.210
...them to what they're
afraid of, a little at a time...

45:48.410 --> 45:50.130
...till they get more
comfortable with it.

45:50.530 --> 45:53.410
-It's not gonna work.
-What have you got to lose?

45:59.210 --> 46:02.530
-I don't think I like this.
-It's okay.

46:02.810 --> 46:04.130
We don't have to go any further.

46:04.330 --> 46:06.130
Today, we can just hang
out in ankle-water.

46:08.010 --> 46:10.210
Your entire family must
think I'm a total nut.

46:12.330 --> 46:13.410
Then you'll fit right in.

46:21.330 --> 46:22.730
I'm so hungry.

46:24.610 --> 46:26.730
Do you want some of the
possibly poisonous berries?

46:28.330 --> 46:29.410
No.

46:29.810 --> 46:32.130
Well they didn't kill me yesterday
so they must be fine.

46:33.210 --> 46:35.810
True! Thank you.

46:40.610 --> 46:42.210
You know that eventually
you're gonna...

46:42.410 --> 46:44.530
...have to trust that
everything's gonna be okay?

46:47.530 --> 46:48.930
I'm so tired.

46:51.010 --> 46:52.410
But we have to
stay awake until...

46:52.810 --> 46:55.210
...it's tomorrow so the day
can't start all over again.

46:57.230 --> 47:01.310
Okay. How about this?
Go to sleep.

47:01.910 --> 47:03.030
I'll take the first shift.

47:03.430 --> 47:05.110
You take the next
shift. I'll go to sleep.

47:05.830 --> 47:08.030
That's a great idea. Thank you.

47:09.310 --> 47:12.710
And if it doesn't work, come
and find me, we'll try again.

47:45.310 --> 47:46.510
Hello?
-Good morning.

47:46.830 --> 47:47.910
This is your wake-up call.

47:48.230 --> 47:50.710
Why is this happening?
What did I do to cause it?

47:51.110 --> 47:52.710
Is there anything
I can do to stop it...

47:52.910 --> 47:55.110
...or am I completely powerless
over what's happening?

47:55.630 --> 47:58.830
Hello? Please, help me!

48:01.230 --> 48:04.310
Good morning! Welcome
to our wedding day!

48:05.110 --> 48:08.030
Time to get started. That's
Kenneth and this is Gerry.

48:08.230 --> 48:09.630
-Great. Great.
-And they are to...

48:09.830 --> 48:11.910
You can't transform me!
Nothing can!

48:12.110 --> 48:14.430
This is going to be
who I am forever.

48:14.710 --> 48:15.910
This one day!

48:16.230 --> 48:18.630
This is my past, my present,
and my future...

48:19.030 --> 48:22.510
...and this is not the
happiest day of my life!

48:30.110 --> 48:31.510
Can you get me 50
more of these?

48:43.910 --> 48:47.110
-Honey?
-Peter.

48:47.830 --> 48:50.510
Are you okay? Everyone's
really worried about you.

48:51.710 --> 48:53.830
It's bad luck to see the
bride before the wedding.

48:55.110 --> 48:57.430
That's exactly what I
wanted to talk to you about...

48:58.630 --> 48:59.830
....the wedding.

49:01.110 --> 49:02.310
Do you know we're supposed...

49:02.510 --> 49:04.110
...to be getting
married in an hour?

49:04.910 --> 49:07.230
I can't go through
with that wedding again.

49:08.230 --> 49:09.430
"Again"?

49:10.410 --> 49:12.610
It feels like we've been
getting married for weeks.

49:16.010 --> 49:17.210
Honey...

49:17.530 --> 49:19.530
Why are you so nervous?
We're a perfect match.

49:20.010 --> 49:22.010
We both love opera, golf
and crossword puzzles.

49:22.610 --> 49:23.930
Is that enough?

49:24.610 --> 49:28.210
I think I know what's happening
here and it's all my fault.

49:29.210 --> 49:30.210
It is?

49:30.530 --> 49:32.530
You have every right to
be confused and upset.

49:32.930 --> 49:34.130
I do?

49:35.410 --> 49:37.210
Thank you so much
for understanding.

49:40.410 --> 49:42.130
I just got so caught
up in my own world...

49:42.330 --> 49:43.930
...I forgot
I'm part of a team now.

49:44.610 --> 49:45.610
And I let you down.

49:46.010 --> 49:47.330
You did?

49:51.130 --> 49:53.530
My book was a
huge success and...

49:53.810 --> 49:55.330
...I became a
celebrity overnight.

49:56.610 --> 49:58.530
Now I'm about to be
named chief of the hospital.

49:59.330 --> 50:00.930
Soon, I'll be given
my own talk show.

50:03.730 --> 50:05.130
That has absolutely
nothing to do...

50:05.330 --> 50:07.010
...with what we're
talking about.

50:08.810 --> 50:10.730
Okay, look, if this is
about having a child...

50:10.930 --> 50:12.730
...I've thought about it and
I've come up with a solution.

50:12.930 --> 50:14.610
If, in a few years,
you still want one...

50:14.810 --> 50:16.410
...we can have a
child, and I'll film...

50:16.610 --> 50:17.610
...the whole thing
for my new TV show.

50:17.810 --> 50:19.010
The segment will be called...

50:19.210 --> 50:21.210
..."Be Heart-Healthy From
Conception to Delivery."

50:21.410 --> 50:23.930
You give birth,
and I deliver live on-air.

50:24.530 --> 50:25.810
No one's done that.

50:29.010 --> 50:30.330
Well? What do you say?

50:30.610 --> 50:32.210
We forget this whole
thing ever happened?

50:32.410 --> 50:35.010
You put on that wedding dress,
and we go get married.

50:43.130 --> 50:44.710
Hello?
-Good morning.

50:44.730 --> 50:45.730
This is your wake-up...

50:53.330 --> 50:56.210
Good morning! Welcome
to our wedding day...

50:57.410 --> 50:58.530
Where are you going?

51:06.010 --> 51:07.010
What are you doing here?

51:07.210 --> 51:08.530
Shouldn't you be getting
ready for your wedding?

51:08.730 --> 51:10.130
You promised to
help me get over...

51:10.330 --> 51:12.410
...my fear of water.
So... help?

51:17.330 --> 51:19.130
So if I understand you...

51:19.710 --> 51:21.830
...this day keeps happening
over and over again...

51:22.130 --> 51:23.810
...and I'm giving you
swimming lessons...

51:23.810 --> 51:25.210
...to help you get over
your fear?

51:25.410 --> 51:26.730
-Yes!
-But...

51:26.930 --> 51:28.530
...I don't remember
any of it because...

51:28.830 --> 51:30.710
...for me, this is the first
time it's happened?

51:31.010 --> 51:34.130
Exactly! So today,
we go in up to our knees.

51:34.730 --> 51:35.930
I'm doing very well.

51:37.210 --> 51:38.530
Well, then I think you should...

51:38.730 --> 51:40.610
...put your head in, maybe
float on your back.

51:40.810 --> 51:43.010
I don't think so.
But maybe tomorrow...

51:43.530 --> 51:46.130
Well, I guess today.
Maybe never.

51:48.330 --> 51:50.330
What happened that made
you so afraid of the water?

51:51.210 --> 51:53.410
You know, I wasn't always
scared of the water.

51:53.810 --> 51:55.410
As a kid, I went
swimming all the time.

51:56.330 --> 51:57.930
But then one day,
I just looked at...

51:58.130 --> 52:00.530
...the water and
decided it was unsafe.

52:00.930 --> 52:03.330
You know? It was
dangerous and risky and...

52:05.910 --> 52:07.510
...I know that doesn't
make any sense.

52:15.030 --> 52:18.110
Okay. Thank you for the lesson.

52:18.910 --> 52:20.230
I have to go get married now.

52:21.510 --> 52:23.430
Okay. See you at the wedding.

52:24.710 --> 52:26.230
By the way,
I love the speech that...

52:26.430 --> 52:28.230
...you're gonna make.
It's very sweet.

52:29.630 --> 52:30.910
I haven't written that yet.

52:34.830 --> 52:36.830
And tomorrow,
we go up to your waist!

52:37.910 --> 52:39.230
Fine.
I'll wear my bathing suit.

52:48.430 --> 52:51.230
I can't believe I went swimming!
I'm a swimmer!

52:52.230 --> 52:53.310
You're a fast learner.

52:58.410 --> 53:00.610
Actually, I'm not.
It's been days of lessons.

53:05.530 --> 53:09.330
-I was just scared.
-Yeah. We all are.

53:10.810 --> 53:13.130
It's what you do in spite of
your fear that defines you.

53:17.410 --> 53:18.730
Peter told me your parents...

53:19.610 --> 53:22.010
...they died in a car accident
when you were pretty young.

53:23.210 --> 53:25.210
They were just on their way
to the hardware store.

53:26.410 --> 53:28.010
I mean, if you can
die while going to...

53:28.210 --> 53:30.410
...pick up lightbulbs,
then nothing's safe.

53:32.130 --> 53:33.810
So that's when you
made the decision to...

53:34.210 --> 53:36.010
...play it safe, not to
take any risk, and...

53:37.210 --> 53:38.610
...live life by the numbers.

53:40.130 --> 53:42.610
And there's nothing wrong
with that. That's smart.

53:44.330 --> 53:45.930
Yes, but it's also an illusion.

53:47.730 --> 53:49.930
I hate to break it to you
but you can make...

53:50.130 --> 53:52.530
...all the right choices and
live life within the lines...

53:53.410 --> 53:55.610
...but life's still gonna
happen to you...

53:55.930 --> 53:57.330
...and you have
no control over it.

53:57.810 --> 53:59.530
Okay, well, I have
the illusion of control.

54:00.730 --> 54:02.330
What's the worst
that could happen?

54:03.610 --> 54:05.330
I don't know.
That's the problem.

54:06.810 --> 54:08.610
Yeah, but it seems
like you already...

54:08.930 --> 54:11.130
...went through the worst,
and you made it through.

54:17.210 --> 54:18.930
So if you could go
anywhere in the world...

54:19.130 --> 54:20.330
...where would you like to go?

54:21.410 --> 54:24.210
-Why?
-Just making conversation.

54:25.330 --> 54:26.330
Egypt.

54:26.610 --> 54:28.330
Cairo. I want to see
the pyramid of Giza.

54:29.730 --> 54:31.130
That's the one in the
middle, right?

54:31.330 --> 54:33.010
The biggest one?
It's still intact.

54:33.730 --> 54:35.130
It's actually
the oldest of the...

54:35.330 --> 54:38.210
...Seven Wonders of the
World. It's breathtaking.

54:39.210 --> 54:42.730
-You've been there?
-Yeah. Cairo's an amazing city.

54:44.530 --> 54:46.810
The architecture there is
still standing after so long.

54:47.410 --> 54:49.410
That's actually why I
wanted to be an architect.

54:50.510 --> 54:53.030
I want to be a part of something
that's here after I'm gone.

54:56.710 --> 54:59.030
Your wedding's happening
in a couple hours, so...

54:59.430 --> 55:00.430
No.

55:01.230 --> 55:03.030
I cannot go through with
that wedding again.

55:03.230 --> 55:04.830
I know your mother
means well, but it is...

55:05.030 --> 55:06.310
Okay, the dress...

55:06.510 --> 55:08.830
...the dress is wrong, the
flowers are horrible, the...

55:09.030 --> 55:12.230
...the cake is sugar-free,
gluten-free lemon.

55:12.910 --> 55:14.830
Who has a lemon wedding cake?
That's just sad.

55:15.430 --> 55:16.710
My first dance is humiliating.

55:17.110 --> 55:18.710
I can't dance, everyone's
looking at me.

55:19.710 --> 55:21.110
So learn to dance.

55:22.030 --> 55:24.230
No, I'm serious. Anyone
can learn to dance.

55:25.230 --> 55:27.030
My mother put Peter
and I in six years of...

55:27.230 --> 55:28.630
...dance classes
when we were kids.

55:28.910 --> 55:31.630
If I can teach you how to swim
I can teach you how to dance.

55:36.110 --> 55:37.110
What are you doing here?

55:37.310 --> 55:39.230
Shouldn't you be getting
ready for your wedding?

55:39.630 --> 55:41.230
You promised to teach
me how to dance.

55:41.510 --> 55:42.510
I did?

55:48.330 --> 55:50.410
Okay, so I'm gonna put
my hand on your waist...

55:50.810 --> 55:52.930
...you put your hand up here
on my shoulder. Good.

55:53.530 --> 55:54.610
I'm gonna step forward.

55:54.810 --> 55:57.410
You step back with your
right foot. And to the side.

55:58.210 --> 56:01.730
And back. And to the side.
Good.

56:02.530 --> 56:03.610
Now, if only we had music.

56:05.610 --> 56:07.730
Okay, not so tense.
Relax your shoulders.

56:08.210 --> 56:10.130
I'm still horrible!
I'll never get this.

56:10.930 --> 56:12.210
Well, it takes time.

56:12.930 --> 56:15.610
Be willing to let go of fear
and judgment, and just...

56:16.010 --> 56:17.730
...move to the music.
-Okay.

56:20.130 --> 56:21.530
Okay, close your eyes.

56:22.330 --> 56:24.730
Now I want you to go back to
when you were a little girl...

56:24.930 --> 56:26.810
...just dancing in your
room with your sister.

56:28.010 --> 56:29.610
There's no fear,
there's no judgment...

56:31.010 --> 56:32.730
...just the joy of
moving to the music.

56:36.210 --> 56:37.930
You know what?
When I was really little...

56:38.130 --> 56:39.330
...I wanted to be a ballerina.

56:39.610 --> 56:40.610
Really?

56:41.330 --> 56:42.930
I have no idea why
I just told you that!

56:43.130 --> 56:44.330
I have never told anyone that.

56:45.610 --> 56:46.810
Dancing is very intimate.

56:48.630 --> 56:50.710
Okay, you tell me something
you've never told anyone.

56:52.110 --> 56:54.310
And you had a huge crush on
your third-grade teacher...

56:54.510 --> 56:55.710
...and you never told anyone.

56:56.310 --> 56:57.830
What? How do you know that?

56:58.510 --> 57:02.110
I know about
Rachel and Lily and Malina.

57:03.510 --> 57:05.710
Okay, so I haven't
been very lucky in love...

57:06.510 --> 57:08.110
...but neither have you,
up until now.

57:08.510 --> 57:10.910
I mean, before my brother,
you dated some epic losers.

57:12.510 --> 57:15.510
-Wait! How did you know that?
-Cause you just told me.

57:25.110 --> 57:27.910
-You're a wonderful dancer.
-I had a great teacher.

57:28.710 --> 57:32.030
-And this is your first lesson?
-It feels like weeks of lessons.

57:33.710 --> 57:37.430
-Where did you get the orchestra?
-I Googled them.

57:45.630 --> 57:47.430
Your grandmother said
something in Italian...

57:47.630 --> 57:49.630
...yesterday, and you and
Peter had a reaction.

57:50.430 --> 57:53.430
-What did she say?
-I can't tell you what she said.

57:54.710 --> 57:56.310
Then I'll just have to
learn Italian.

58:02.630 --> 58:05.710
-Ciao. Come stai?
-Ciao! Come stai?

58:10.430 --> 58:13.510
Lesson two. I'm so
happy to meet you.

58:14.430 --> 58:17.110
Sono cosi contenta
di incontrare voi.

58:19.130 --> 58:22.010
Sono cosi contenta
di incontrare voi.

58:29.010 --> 58:30.730
Era tanti anni che
mi vado in Italia.

58:31.010 --> 58:33.210
Mi piacerebbe trascorrere una
vacanza in quest'estate.

58:34.130 --> 58:36.330
Era tanti anni che
mi vado in Italia.

58:36.730 --> 58:40.930
Mi piacerebbe trascorrere una
vacanza in quest'estate.

58:55.010 --> 58:57.330
There has got to be a way to
make this wedding better.

59:06.210 --> 59:09.530
Hi, Kate? Can you meet me in
the lobby in 10 minutes?

59:13.130 --> 59:15.810
-These smell so good.
-They do.

59:20.010 --> 59:21.010
These are my favorite.

59:22.130 --> 59:23.410
Those are my favorite!

59:24.810 --> 59:28.130
Do you remember when I was little
and I broke my arm skating?

59:29.210 --> 59:30.210
Yes!

59:30.530 --> 59:33.530
You were so brave when they were
putting on your little cast.

59:34.730 --> 59:36.330
You slept in a sleeping
bag on...

59:36.730 --> 59:38.530
...the floor next to my
bed for two weeks.

59:38.930 --> 59:41.530
I can't believe you remember
this. You were so young!

59:42.210 --> 59:44.530
Daddy used to carry you
back to your bed...

59:44.810 --> 59:46.410
...but you'd come back.

59:47.410 --> 59:49.010
Well, I didn't want
you to feel alone.

59:51.130 --> 59:53.730
I'm glad you are my sister.
I love you.

59:57.530 --> 59:59.810
I love you, too. Okay,
what should we do next?

01:00:02.610 --> 01:00:05.010
Try this one. It's like a
surprise party for your mouth.

01:00:07.010 --> 01:00:10.130
So you're back to eating sugar
and gluten and caffeine?

01:00:10.610 --> 01:00:12.130
-Yeah, I'm...
-Thank you.

01:00:12.810 --> 01:00:13.930
I eat everything today.

01:00:14.530 --> 01:00:16.330
I'll stop tomorrow if
tomorrow ever comes.

01:00:16.730 --> 01:00:19.330
That is both optimistic and
pessimistic at the same time.

01:00:20.130 --> 01:00:21.610
I've realized you can
color inside...

01:00:21.810 --> 01:00:24.130
...the lines all you want,
but it doesn't keep you safe.

01:00:24.330 --> 01:00:26.610
It's all an illusion.
Life just happens...

01:00:27.130 --> 01:00:29.730
...and we just have to try
and keep up. That's amazing.

01:00:30.130 --> 01:00:31.410
Try the key-lime.

01:00:33.930 --> 01:00:34.930
That is good.

01:00:35.330 --> 01:00:36.410
Question...

01:00:36.930 --> 01:00:38.410
Why are we here
trying wedding cakes?

01:00:39.010 --> 01:00:41.010
Because I want to get the
best one for my wedding.

01:00:42.210 --> 01:00:44.730
Right... but you realize
that there is a wedding...

01:00:44.930 --> 01:00:46.530
...that is supposed
to happen in an hour?

01:00:46.730 --> 01:00:47.930
A wedding for you and Peter...

01:00:48.130 --> 01:00:49.610
...and they already
have a cake and...

01:00:49.810 --> 01:00:51.010
...flowers and food...

01:00:51.210 --> 01:00:52.730
Yes, but I thought
about what you said...

01:00:52.930 --> 01:00:54.330
...and you were right
it's my wedding.

01:00:54.730 --> 01:00:56.730
Shouldn't I have everything
the way I want it?

01:00:57.410 --> 01:00:59.210
True. I'm just worried...

01:00:59.410 --> 01:01:01.010
...that you might be
losing your mind.

01:01:01.330 --> 01:01:04.130
I might be. But
shouldn't we enjoy it?

01:01:05.210 --> 01:01:06.810
I wish Mom were here
to do this with us.

01:01:07.010 --> 01:01:09.610
She is here, because
we are here and...

01:01:09.810 --> 01:01:11.330
...she's a part of us.

01:01:27.330 --> 01:01:30.730
It's pretty but...

01:01:32.330 --> 01:01:33.410
I agree.

01:01:36.730 --> 01:01:37.730
Careful.

01:01:47.210 --> 01:01:48.330
That's the one.

01:01:48.610 --> 01:01:49.810
I agree!

01:01:53.610 --> 01:01:56.210
It's called the "Princess dress,"
and I love it!

01:01:58.310 --> 01:02:01.230
It's perfect.
You look just like Mom.

01:02:02.510 --> 01:02:04.230
She and Daddy
would be so proud of you.

01:02:06.910 --> 01:02:09.630
You look beautiful!
When's the wedding?

01:02:10.630 --> 01:02:11.710
Today.

01:02:13.710 --> 01:02:16.430
Do you have a maid-of-honor dress
that matches with this?

01:02:16.710 --> 01:02:17.830
Something that isn't pink.

01:02:18.030 --> 01:02:20.230
You know what? I think we do.
I'll be right back.

01:02:22.310 --> 01:02:23.310
So...

01:02:23.510 --> 01:02:25.910
Have you talked to Max
since the kiss yesterday?

01:02:27.110 --> 01:02:28.910
Actually, I have.

01:02:30.030 --> 01:02:32.310
And? What's he like?

01:02:33.230 --> 01:02:36.630
He's intelligent and
inspiring and...

01:02:36.910 --> 01:02:38.710
...compassionate,
and he loves being...

01:02:39.110 --> 01:02:41.110
...a doctor and helping people.

01:02:41.430 --> 01:02:45.310
And he dances and he plays guitar
and he loves children.

01:02:46.230 --> 01:02:50.630
You found all that out in one day?
He sounds like a great guy.

01:02:51.430 --> 01:02:52.830
He really is.

01:02:53.830 --> 01:02:56.230
So? What are you
gonna do about it?

01:02:58.510 --> 01:03:00.510
Nothing. He's Peter's brother.

01:03:01.830 --> 01:03:04.710
Yeah, but when you talk about him
your whole face smiles.

01:03:08.910 --> 01:03:10.510
This is gonna be the
perfect wedding.

01:03:13.630 --> 01:03:15.030
Well...

01:03:15.310 --> 01:03:17.630
I'm just happy I got
to help you plan it.

01:03:19.510 --> 01:03:20.510
Do you know what?

01:03:21.710 --> 01:03:24.710
If I had to live one day
over and over again...

01:03:25.110 --> 01:03:26.630
...I would live this
one with you.

01:03:29.110 --> 01:03:30.430
Do you hear that, universe?

01:03:31.430 --> 01:03:34.110
If I have to live one day
over and over again...

01:03:34.430 --> 01:03:35.510
...I pick this one!

01:03:41.430 --> 01:03:42.510
Hello?
-Good morning.

01:03:42.830 --> 01:03:43.910
This is your wake-up call.

01:03:44.230 --> 01:03:46.110
Good morning, Linda.
How's Pepper doing?

01:03:46.430 --> 01:03:48.430
-You know Pepper?
-Well, of course I know Pepper!

01:03:48.630 --> 01:03:50.830
You can't know Linda without
knowing her puppy, Pepper.

01:03:51.430 --> 01:03:52.510
Hello!

01:03:52.830 --> 01:03:54.630
Can you connect me to
Loretta the concierge?

01:03:55.110 --> 01:03:56.110
Hi, Loretta!

01:03:56.310 --> 01:03:58.110
This is Jaclyn Palmer in
the bridal suite.

01:03:58.630 --> 01:04:00.710
Yesterday, I saw a dress
in the wedding store.

01:04:00.910 --> 01:04:02.430
It's called the "Princess"
gown and...

01:04:02.630 --> 01:04:04.310
...there's a blush-colored
maid-of-honor...

01:04:04.510 --> 01:04:05.510
...dress that matches it.

01:04:05.710 --> 01:04:07.510
I need both dresses
in a size four.

01:04:07.830 --> 01:04:09.310
Can you send someone
down there with...

01:04:09.510 --> 01:04:11.510
...my credit card, and have them
shipped to my room?

01:04:11.710 --> 01:04:14.830
Fantastic! I'm also gonna need
some white roses and some orchids.

01:04:15.110 --> 01:04:16.710
They have them at
the florist on Main.

01:04:16.910 --> 01:04:18.830
I'd like them wrapped in
white ribbon, and...

01:04:19.310 --> 01:04:22.110
You know, can you just come to my
room with a pen and a pad of paper?

01:04:22.430 --> 01:04:24.510
I have a whole list of things
I'm gonna need for today.

01:04:24.710 --> 01:04:25.910
Thanks.

01:04:29.230 --> 01:04:30.510
What's going on?

01:04:30.830 --> 01:04:32.430
I've made some
changes to the wedding.

01:04:32.630 --> 01:04:33.630
What?

01:04:33.910 --> 01:04:36.910
I appreciate everything you've
done but it's my wedding.

01:04:37.630 --> 01:04:39.830
Right? I should have
everything the way I want it!

01:04:40.110 --> 01:04:42.510
-I guess, but there's no time...
-Kate's here.

01:04:43.430 --> 01:04:44.430
Don't say anything.

01:04:45.830 --> 01:04:47.630
Don't worry. You don't
have to wear that.

01:04:48.430 --> 01:04:51.230
Boys I know exactly how
I want my hair and makeup.

01:04:54.030 --> 01:04:56.910
Can't you see where you're going?
What's the matter with you?

01:04:57.310 --> 01:04:58.910
-I'm sorry. I'm so...
-Hold on a second.

01:04:59.110 --> 01:05:01.710
Excuse me! Hi.
It wasn't his fault.

01:05:02.910 --> 01:05:05.510
You were on your cell phone and
you weren't paying attention.

01:05:06.910 --> 01:05:07.910
Have a nice day.

01:05:16.830 --> 01:05:21.410
You look beautiful.
Just like Mom.

01:05:22.510 --> 01:05:23.630
Let's go.

01:05:26.830 --> 01:05:28.830
Friends and family, we are
gathered here today...

01:05:29.030 --> 01:05:31.230
...to join this man and this
woman in holy matrimony.

01:05:31.510 --> 01:05:33.510
Marriage is...
-He does, and I do, too!

01:05:33.910 --> 01:05:36.910
So everyone join us for the best
wedding you'll ever go to!

01:05:39.630 --> 01:05:43.630
-What? What are you doing?
-Phillip, what is she doing?

01:05:57.430 --> 01:05:58.630
Fry?

01:05:59.430 --> 01:06:00.630
What's going on?

01:06:01.110 --> 01:06:04.030
This is our wedding.
We should get to plan it.

01:06:04.510 --> 01:06:06.910
I had them serve all my
favorite foods. Thank you!

01:06:08.830 --> 01:06:10.630
But there's meat
and there's gluten.

01:06:11.310 --> 01:06:13.830
Okay, I thought of a chapter
for your new book.

01:06:14.630 --> 01:06:18.230
"Eat What Makes You Happy So
Your Heart Can Smile."

01:06:20.030 --> 01:06:22.630
But that's completely off-brand
and it makes no sense.

01:06:22.910 --> 01:06:26.510
None of this makes any sense.
Let's dance.

01:06:27.230 --> 01:06:30.110
-You don't dance.
-I do now!

01:06:33.510 --> 01:06:35.310
It's bad for your you'll
have a heart attack!

01:07:18.010 --> 01:07:19.330
That was a wonderful wedding.

01:07:19.810 --> 01:07:21.130
My grandmother's still dancing.

01:07:21.410 --> 01:07:25.930
It was perfect. The dress
and the flowers... the cake.

01:07:31.610 --> 01:07:33.010
Why'd you marry my brother?

01:07:36.530 --> 01:07:40.010
He... asked?

01:07:41.730 --> 01:07:44.010
And it seemed like the
answer to all my dreams...

01:07:45.030 --> 01:07:48.830
...and he makes me
feel safe and cared for.

01:07:50.830 --> 01:07:54.110
And that's enough for you?
To feel "safe and cared for"?

01:07:55.830 --> 01:07:58.710
And he loves me. He
doesn't try and change me.

01:07:59.030 --> 01:08:01.710
He accepts me for
the way I am. Mostly.

01:08:03.910 --> 01:08:08.230
I just think we have a really
good chance of being happy.

01:08:11.230 --> 01:08:13.310
You seem like a strong,
confident woman...

01:08:14.830 --> 01:08:16.430
...and actually,
you're just a coward.

01:08:19.109 --> 01:08:22.109
-I'm a coward?
-Yes. You are.

01:08:22.430 --> 01:08:23.830
You took the easy way out.

01:08:24.830 --> 01:08:28.109
So what's wrong with that?
I'll never be heartbroken...

01:08:28.510 --> 01:08:30.830
...I will never feel
hurt or disappointed...

01:08:31.229 --> 01:08:32.830
...I will never have
to lose someone...

01:08:33.029 --> 01:08:34.430
...who I can't
bear to lose again.

01:08:35.830 --> 01:08:37.310
Yeah that's true.

01:08:40.510 --> 01:08:41.910
But you'll also
never know what...

01:08:42.109 --> 01:08:44.109
...it feels like to love
with your whole heart.

01:08:45.510 --> 01:08:48.029
To know, in a single
moment, what you've...

01:08:48.229 --> 01:08:49.830
...been missing
for an entire lifetime.

01:08:52.229 --> 01:08:55.109
We just met, and I feel
like I've known you forever.

01:08:56.510 --> 01:08:57.830
We just met, and I feel like...

01:08:58.029 --> 01:08:59.830
...we've taken a
hundred long walks...

01:09:00.029 --> 01:09:01.430
...and talked for a
thousand hours.

01:09:06.010 --> 01:09:08.529
But Peter's my brother
and now you're his wife...

01:09:10.930 --> 01:09:14.410
...and this...
this can't be real.

01:09:40.210 --> 01:09:42.210
Well, that was a great
wedding, wasn't it?

01:09:43.810 --> 01:09:47.330
Well, it certainly was different.
I think Mother's feelings were hurt.

01:09:49.529 --> 01:09:51.010
I was thinking
maybe we could go to...

01:09:51.330 --> 01:09:52.810
...Egypt for a honeymoon.

01:09:53.609 --> 01:09:55.330
You know I'm far too
busy for a honeymoon.

01:09:56.010 --> 01:10:00.130
Well, not right now, but someday
I'd like to go to Cairo.

01:10:00.530 --> 01:10:02.210
I really want to see
the pyramid of Giza.

01:10:04.130 --> 01:10:05.610
Why would you
want to go to a city...

01:10:05.810 --> 01:10:07.210
...where everything is old?

01:10:07.410 --> 01:10:10.210
If we take a honeymoon anywhere
it's gonna be Hawaii.

01:10:12.330 --> 01:10:14.130
I think maybe we
should've gotten to know...

01:10:14.330 --> 01:10:16.410
...each other a little better
before we got married.

01:10:16.610 --> 01:10:18.410
We should have taken
a hundred long walks...

01:10:19.330 --> 01:10:20.730
...and talked for a
thousand hours.

01:10:22.610 --> 01:10:23.810
I thought we did.

01:10:42.010 --> 01:10:43.210
Good morning, Linda.

01:10:43.810 --> 01:10:45.810
Good morning.
This is your wake-up call.

01:10:46.410 --> 01:10:47.530
Thank you.

01:10:58.010 --> 01:10:59.010
What are you doing here?

01:10:59.330 --> 01:11:01.210
Shouldn't you be getting
ready for your wedding?

01:11:01.410 --> 01:11:03.210
I was wondering if you
wanted to take a walk.

01:11:37.810 --> 01:11:38.810
What are you doing here?

01:11:39.210 --> 01:11:40.610
Shouldn't you be getting
ready for your wedding?

01:11:40.810 --> 01:11:42.930
I was wondering if you
wanted to go on a bike ride.

01:12:11.110 --> 01:12:12.110
What are you doing here?

01:12:12.610 --> 01:12:13.930
Shouldn't you be getting
ready for your wedding?

01:12:14.130 --> 01:12:16.010
I was wondering if you
wanted to go on a picnic.

01:12:17.810 --> 01:12:19.930
And put on some sunscreen.
You burn so easily.

01:12:21.810 --> 01:12:23.130
How do you know that?

01:12:28.930 --> 01:12:30.210
I love this spot!

01:12:30.730 --> 01:12:31.730
I know.

01:12:32.130 --> 01:12:34.010
It's where you found
your lucky silver dollar.

01:12:34.210 --> 01:12:36.810
-How do you know that?
-Because you told me.

01:12:37.530 --> 01:12:38.610
No, I didn't.

01:12:39.210 --> 01:12:40.930
You say that you keep
it in your wallet...

01:12:41.130 --> 01:12:43.010
...behind your driver's
license for good luck...

01:12:43.210 --> 01:12:46.210
...but I think you really keep
it there to remind you of home.

01:12:47.730 --> 01:12:50.410
-Who are you?
-What do you mean?

01:12:51.010 --> 01:12:52.730
Well, how do you know
so much about me?

01:12:53.130 --> 01:12:55.010
Well, some things I know
because you told me...

01:12:55.210 --> 01:12:58.010
...and some things I know
from spending time with you.

01:12:58.210 --> 01:13:00.210
I've realized I think the
most important thing...

01:13:00.410 --> 01:13:02.530
...in the world is having
someone really know you.

01:13:05.730 --> 01:13:07.010
These are all my favorite foods.

01:13:07.810 --> 01:13:09.130
I know.

01:13:09.530 --> 01:13:11.530
Except for the beets. I...
I don't like Beets.

01:13:11.730 --> 01:13:13.410
-Yes, you do.
-No, I don't.

01:13:13.810 --> 01:13:15.930
You don't like them because
you haven't tried them...

01:13:16.130 --> 01:13:18.730
...but last time we were here you
tried them and you liked them.

01:13:19.630 --> 01:13:21.230
Our last picnic,
which was another...

01:13:21.630 --> 01:13:22.910
...day but is also today?

01:13:23.230 --> 01:13:24.310
Exactly.

01:13:31.230 --> 01:13:32.310
I like beets!

01:13:36.710 --> 01:13:38.030
Peter's a lucky man.

01:13:39.310 --> 01:13:41.030
I don't think he even
wants to get married.

01:13:44.230 --> 01:13:46.630
Well, there's a way to
tell if Peter's unsure...

01:13:46.910 --> 01:13:48.110
...of what he's saying.

01:13:48.430 --> 01:13:50.110
He smiles and he
bites his lower lip.

01:13:50.710 --> 01:13:52.830
That's how I was always
able to beat him at poker...

01:13:53.030 --> 01:13:54.310
...when we were kids.

01:13:59.030 --> 01:14:03.510
The most romantic day of the year
is coming, and I wanted to know...

01:14:04.430 --> 01:14:06.430
...if you'll accept my
proposal in making...

01:14:06.510 --> 01:14:08.030
...our dreams come true.

01:14:14.710 --> 01:14:17.510
Do you, Peter, take this woman
to be your lawfully wedded wife...

01:14:18.110 --> 01:14:19.830
...to have and to hold,
forever and ever?

01:14:21.430 --> 01:14:22.630
I do.

01:14:22.910 --> 01:14:24.630
And do you, Jaclyn,
take this man to be...

01:14:24.830 --> 01:14:26.110
...your lawfully wedded husband?

01:14:26.310 --> 01:14:31.110
-Why do you want to marry me?
-What?

01:14:32.510 --> 01:14:37.310
-Why did you ask me to marry you?
-Because I love you?

01:14:38.430 --> 01:14:39.910
What is it that
you love about me?

01:14:41.830 --> 01:14:43.430
You're really smart
and you're pretty.

01:14:44.630 --> 01:14:48.430
Specifically, what is it
about me that you love?

01:14:49.630 --> 01:14:53.910
-I don't understand the question.
-What's my middle name?

01:14:54.710 --> 01:14:56.030
I don't know.
Is that important?

01:14:57.110 --> 01:15:02.110
Why am I afraid of the water?
Why did I become an architect?

01:15:02.830 --> 01:15:04.510
What's my favorite
flavor of ice cream?

01:15:04.710 --> 01:15:06.430
Where do I want to
live when we get old?

01:15:07.930 --> 01:15:12.330
-How do I take my coffee?
-Should I know those things?

01:15:12.730 --> 01:15:14.410
I mean, won't we have
an entire lifetime...

01:15:14.610 --> 01:15:17.210
...together to discover all of
that stuff about each other?

01:15:17.410 --> 01:15:19.530
That "stuff" is what
makes us who we are.

01:15:19.810 --> 01:15:21.410
It's why we fall in
love with someone.

01:15:22.330 --> 01:15:23.330
Being known and loved...

01:15:23.610 --> 01:15:25.730
...for who you really are,
that's what matters!

01:15:27.530 --> 01:15:28.530
She's crazy!

01:15:30.130 --> 01:15:32.930
-Why are you doing this?
-You don't want to marry me.

01:15:33.130 --> 01:15:34.330
We barely know each other.

01:15:35.010 --> 01:15:36.210
You're only doing this
because your mother...

01:15:36.410 --> 01:15:37.730
...convinced you it
would help you...

01:15:37.930 --> 01:15:39.210
...make chief of the hospital.

01:15:39.510 --> 01:15:42.310
That is the stupidest thing
I've heard in my entire life!

01:15:43.710 --> 01:15:45.030
What's worse is that...

01:15:46.030 --> 01:15:47.810
...I don't think you
even want that job.

01:15:48.730 --> 01:15:50.330
You're a good man
and a great doctor.

01:15:50.730 --> 01:15:53.330
You love writing and
traveling and being on TV.

01:15:54.210 --> 01:15:56.810
You don't want the responsibility
of running a hospital.

01:15:57.210 --> 01:15:58.410
You want to be Dr. Phil!

01:15:58.730 --> 01:16:00.410
You don't know what
you're talking about!

01:16:00.610 --> 01:16:02.410
Peter's dream is to run
that hospital!

01:16:05.610 --> 01:16:06.930
No, Ma.

01:16:09.010 --> 01:16:11.730
She's right. I don't.

01:16:12.410 --> 01:16:13.610
That's nonsense!

01:16:14.010 --> 01:16:17.130
You have the opportunity to have
everything you ever wanted!

01:16:17.330 --> 01:16:18.730
No, Ma, that's
what you want for me.

01:16:19.010 --> 01:16:20.210
You have no idea what I want!

01:16:20.410 --> 01:16:23.730
Margaret! S-sit down.

01:16:36.430 --> 01:16:40.830
Peter, you are a wonderful man.

01:16:43.110 --> 01:16:46.510
But, I want true love...

01:16:48.410 --> 01:16:52.410
...messy, scary love
that requires risk.

01:16:55.130 --> 01:16:56.610
Love that takes a leap of faith.

01:16:59.130 --> 01:17:02.210
You're right.
I don't know if I'm...

01:17:02.610 --> 01:17:03.930
...ready to take that leap.

01:17:04.930 --> 01:17:06.330
But if I did,
it would be with you.

01:17:07.930 --> 01:17:09.330
That's very sweet.

01:17:11.210 --> 01:17:14.210
Se qualcosa e giusta,
ci si sente...

01:17:14.530 --> 01:17:16.410
...come in un bagno caldo.

01:17:19.330 --> 01:17:21.410
She said,
"If something is right...

01:17:21.730 --> 01:17:24.530
...it should feel like you're
getting into a warm bath."

01:17:25.130 --> 01:17:26.330
You speak Italian?

01:17:28.730 --> 01:17:29.730
Yes.

01:17:30.530 --> 01:17:31.930
My sister's so awesome!

01:17:52.130 --> 01:17:53.330
So that went well.

01:17:54.430 --> 01:17:56.710
I will apologize to
your entire family.

01:18:02.230 --> 01:18:03.630
Do you think Peter's okay?

01:18:05.430 --> 01:18:08.830
He looks relieved.
You were brave.

01:18:10.110 --> 01:18:11.510
You told the truth.

01:18:12.630 --> 01:18:15.630
That didn't come from your head
it came from the heart.

01:18:17.030 --> 01:18:21.030
-You know me so well.
-I've only known you two days.

01:18:21.710 --> 01:18:24.830
That's not true.
We've taken a hundred walks...

01:18:25.110 --> 01:18:27.030
...and talked for
a thousand hours.

01:18:28.230 --> 01:18:31.310
-That's impossible.
-You told me you'd say that...

01:18:31.510 --> 01:18:33.310
...and I'm supposed to
tell you that...

01:18:33.510 --> 01:18:35.110
...you became a doctor
because of Sam.

01:18:38.310 --> 01:18:39.310
How could you?

01:18:39.630 --> 01:18:41.230
You didn't tell me
what it meant.

01:18:42.110 --> 01:18:44.110
You just said to tell you
it's because of Sam.

01:18:47.710 --> 01:18:49.710
Sam is this little boy
that I met...

01:18:49.910 --> 01:18:51.430
...on my first trip to
South Africa.

01:18:53.110 --> 01:18:56.110
He came in to the clinic
where I was working and...

01:18:57.310 --> 01:18:59.030
I helped him get his
first pair of glasses.

01:19:01.810 --> 01:19:04.530
And when he put 'em on,
he started crying.

01:19:06.410 --> 01:19:07.410
And I asked him why...

01:19:07.810 --> 01:19:10.530
...and he said because up
until that moment...

01:19:12.610 --> 01:19:14.610
...he didn't know how
beautiful the world could be.

01:19:18.130 --> 01:19:20.530
That little boy opened
my eyes to a world...

01:19:20.810 --> 01:19:22.610
....that I'd never seen before.

01:19:25.930 --> 01:19:29.010
A world where you could make a
real difference in people's lives.

01:19:31.810 --> 01:19:33.530
I'm so glad you
told me that story.

01:19:36.930 --> 01:19:38.730
So we've known each other
for a long time?

01:19:39.530 --> 01:19:40.730
We have.

01:19:45.530 --> 01:19:46.610
So now what?

01:19:47.410 --> 01:19:50.330
Well... we try to stay
awake all night...

01:19:50.330 --> 01:19:51.810
...to see if we can
break the spell...

01:19:52.410 --> 01:19:54.130
...but we fall asleep,
and then...

01:19:55.110 --> 01:19:56.510
...I wake up back in the
cabin...

01:19:56.910 --> 01:19:59.310
...and we have to live this
day all over again.

01:20:02.110 --> 01:20:05.230
Well, I don't mind.
It wasn't such a bad day.

01:20:07.310 --> 01:20:10.510
And no matter what happens,
you won't be alone.

01:20:12.110 --> 01:20:14.510
I'll be there and we'll go
through it together.

01:21:10.410 --> 01:21:11.930
It's a new day.

01:21:21.010 --> 01:21:24.930
This is the happiest
day of my life!

01:21:28.930 --> 01:21:30.130
Morning.

01:21:35.330 --> 01:21:36.330
Come on.

01:21:38.330 --> 01:21:39.930
-Where are we going?
-Just come on!

01:21:49.810 --> 01:21:51.210
What are we doing here?

01:21:51.810 --> 01:21:53.130
Let's jump.

01:21:55.810 --> 01:21:57.610
Aren't you afraid of
water and heights?

01:21:59.010 --> 01:22:00.810
Life is full of risk.

01:22:02.530 --> 01:22:05.410
You never know what's gonna happen
but if you don't take chances...

01:22:05.410 --> 01:22:07.410
...then you will never know
what you're capable of.

01:22:08.430 --> 01:22:09.510
That's very wise.

01:22:10.630 --> 01:22:12.630
