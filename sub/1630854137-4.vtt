31:46.948 --> 31:48.167

31:48.210 --> 31:49.646

31:49.690 --> 31:52.693
He was shot
in the back of the head.

33:04.460 --> 33:07.072

33:07.115 --> 33:11.076

after he shot him.

Because he tried to kill
that Indian girl's parents,

33:13.817 --> 33:15.341

33:16.559 --> 33:19.214

33:19.258 --> 33:20.563

than Elias.

33:24.306 --> 33:25.916

33:25.960 --> 33:28.789

that the bullet entered.

33:31.444 --> 33:34.403
- Maybe it was
that Indian girl
