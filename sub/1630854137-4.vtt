00:03.786 --> 00:04.178
.

00:04.221 --> 00:06.006
- In the criminal justice
system,

00:06.049 --> 00:07.355
sexually based offenses

00:07.398 --> 00:09.618
are considered
especially heinous.

00:09.661 --> 00:12.186
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:12.229 --> 00:13.970
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:14.014 --> 00:15.363
are members of an elite squad

00:15.406 --> 00:17.365
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:17.408 --> 00:19.106
These are their stories.

00:24.372 --> 00:26.678
- Mom!
- Hey, sweetie.

00:26.722 --> 00:28.419
Hi.

00:28.463 --> 00:30.508
- I am so sorry, Miss Olivia.

00:30.552 --> 00:32.684
- Oh,
please don't apologize, Martha.

00:32.728 --> 00:34.860
Go home and take care
of your husband's migraine.

00:34.904 --> 00:36.297
- Thank you.
- OK.

00:36.340 --> 00:37.428
We'll see you tomorrow?
- Yes.

00:37.472 --> 00:39.343
- OK, great.
- Yes, bye.

00:39.387 --> 00:41.084
- She feed you yet?
- Not yet.

00:41.128 --> 00:42.825
- Well, Mommy is tired
and hungry,

00:42.868 --> 00:44.305
so what do you say
we go to Shake Shack?

00:44.348 --> 00:46.350
- Really?
- Cute kid.

00:46.394 --> 00:49.092
- Ah, Noah,
this is Detective Muncy.

00:49.136 --> 00:51.094
- Nice to meet you, little man.
- Hi.

00:51.138 --> 00:53.314
- OK, I'll meet you
at the elevator.

00:53.357 --> 00:54.924
You're working late?
- Yeah.

00:54.967 --> 00:57.666
Sarge approved overtime
on my peeping Tom case.

00:57.709 --> 00:59.668
Figured I'd eliminate
every Hamilton Heights rando

00:59.711 --> 01:01.713
on the sex registry
and maybe get lucky

01:01.757 --> 01:03.280
with a perp
that doesn't like to commute.

01:03.324 --> 01:05.804
- Well, did you find anything?
- Big waste of time.

01:05.848 --> 01:08.590
- So there's nothing that
you can do about dead ends,

01:08.633 --> 01:11.723
but just make sure
that all your mistakes happen

01:11.767 --> 01:13.247
before you hit the stand

01:13.290 --> 01:15.162
because
there's no do-overs in court.

01:15.205 --> 01:16.337
- OK.
- OK.

01:16.380 --> 01:19.514
Also, Muncy,
gentle reminder.

01:19.557 --> 01:21.429
This isn't gang unit, right?

01:21.472 --> 01:23.953
You got to do something
about your wardrobe.

01:23.996 --> 01:26.173
OK. Good night.

01:26.216 --> 01:27.478
- Good night.

01:31.917 --> 01:34.746
- Dad, do you even know
what you're doing?

01:34.790 --> 01:36.966
- I do now,
after watching that video

01:37.009 --> 01:39.577
you were kind enough
to send me three times.

01:39.621 --> 01:41.753
- Why don't we just
call a contractor?

01:41.797 --> 01:42.841
- After what happened?

01:42.885 --> 01:44.669
The less we use them,
the better.

01:44.713 --> 01:46.584
And if I do the work,
we'll save money.

01:46.628 --> 01:49.152
Money we need to buy
all the kitchen equipment.

01:49.196 --> 01:51.676
- Dude, this is
too painful to watch.

01:51.720 --> 01:53.287
- Would you like
to give it a try?

01:53.330 --> 01:56.246
- I totally would, if I didn't
have so much math homework.

01:56.290 --> 01:58.422
- Then go do it, totally,

01:58.466 --> 01:59.771
instead of acting
like my supervisor.

01:59.815 --> 02:02.426
- Hey, hey, hey. OK, you two.
- Whatever.

02:02.470 --> 02:04.080
- Do you hear
how she talks to me?

02:04.124 --> 02:06.865
Dude, totally, whatever.
- OK.

02:06.909 --> 02:08.824
Rav, it's America.

02:08.867 --> 02:12.175
You wanted to come here now
for a change.

02:12.219 --> 02:14.308
[laughter]
Come here.

02:16.484 --> 02:18.050
- So what's next,
a pedicure?

02:18.094 --> 02:22.142
- Do I look like the kind
of girl that gets a pedicure?

02:22.185 --> 02:24.187
- Look, I--

02:24.231 --> 02:26.450
I'm not a stylist.
Why am I here?

02:26.494 --> 02:27.973
- I told you.
My brother's got a date.

02:28.017 --> 02:29.975
- Well, for all you know,
I could have been on one too.

02:30.019 --> 02:33.109
- Oh, yeah?
With which hand?

02:33.153 --> 02:34.415
Which one do you like?

02:34.458 --> 02:36.765
- Split the difference
and go with the gray one.

02:36.808 --> 02:38.810
- All right,
weird question.

02:38.854 --> 02:41.987
Which one's the gray one?

02:42.031 --> 02:43.032
- Are you serious?

02:43.075 --> 02:45.643
- Yeah, I'm colorblind.

02:45.687 --> 02:47.515
That's why I asked you
to come with me.

02:53.434 --> 02:55.305
- Yeah, it looks great.
It suits you.

02:55.349 --> 02:57.264
Whatever.
Just get whatever you like.

02:57.307 --> 03:00.049
- It's not about what I like.
It's about what Benson likes.

03:00.092 --> 03:01.442
SVU is not the gang unit.

03:01.485 --> 03:03.052
We're working with victims now,

03:03.095 --> 03:06.186
and Benson wants me to project
empathy and professionalism.

03:06.229 --> 03:07.274
- Well, you got
the first one down.

03:07.317 --> 03:08.840
Come on, cowgirl.

03:15.282 --> 03:16.457
[door rattles]

03:22.724 --> 03:24.247
[door slams]

03:29.818 --> 03:30.993
- Hey.

03:31.036 --> 03:32.690
Who are you?

03:32.734 --> 03:34.736
[stammering]
What are you doing?

03:34.779 --> 03:36.346
There's no money.

03:36.390 --> 03:38.043
I promise.

03:38.087 --> 03:41.264
There is nothing in the till.
We are not open yet.

03:41.308 --> 03:43.223
[upbeat music playing]

03:43.266 --> 03:44.398
[gunshot]

03:45.703 --> 03:46.704
- Rav?

03:49.272 --> 03:50.839
[gunshot]
Aah!

03:52.362 --> 03:54.712
[dialing]

03:54.756 --> 03:55.800
Hello?

03:55.844 --> 03:57.019
- 911.
What's your emergency?

03:57.062 --> 03:58.716
[door slams]

03:58.760 --> 03:59.848
- Where is Priya?

04:01.415 --> 04:02.459
[gunshot]

04:04.026 --> 04:07.943
[dramatic music]

04:07.986 --> 04:14.950
â™ª

04:51.465 --> 04:51.639
.

04:51.682 --> 04:53.728
- Nisha and Rav Singh
own the restaurant

04:53.771 --> 04:55.033
and live
in the apartment above it.

04:55.077 --> 04:56.687
- So the intruder
forced his way in the back?

04:56.731 --> 04:58.820
- Yeah, he shot the husband
in the kitchen,

04:58.863 --> 05:00.561
made his way upstairs
to the wife.

05:00.604 --> 05:02.302
- Are they OK?
- They're both unconscious.

05:02.345 --> 05:03.825
On their way to Mercy
as we speak.

05:03.868 --> 05:05.392
- Listen, so far, this is
sounding like a home invasion.

05:05.435 --> 05:06.436
Why'd you call us?

05:06.480 --> 05:07.437
- Well, the wife was naked.

05:07.481 --> 05:08.786
It looked like a rape.

05:08.830 --> 05:09.961
- Copy that.

05:10.005 --> 05:13.182
[indistinct chatter]

05:18.318 --> 05:20.624
There's a lot of blood.
- Yeah.

05:22.974 --> 05:24.411
- .45 cal.

05:24.454 --> 05:26.195
That guy is lucky to be alive.

05:26.238 --> 05:28.458
- You think the wife
was the real target?

05:28.502 --> 05:29.503
- I mean,
look at the place.

05:29.546 --> 05:30.939
There's nothing to steal.
- Yeah.

05:32.244 --> 05:34.943
- The missus was
laying right here.

05:36.988 --> 05:38.468
- Shower is still wet.

05:38.512 --> 05:40.165
That explains the nudity.

05:40.209 --> 05:41.863
So wife's washing up.

05:41.906 --> 05:42.994
- She hears him coming in,

05:43.038 --> 05:44.779
reaches for the phone,
and calls 911.

05:44.822 --> 05:46.171
- Boom, ambushed.

05:46.215 --> 05:47.999
- The 911 operator
sends the unis,

05:48.043 --> 05:50.611
who only ID it as rape
and get us involved.

05:50.654 --> 05:53.396
- And you don't think
this is a rape?

05:53.440 --> 05:55.442
- One look at the bedroom
will tell.

05:55.485 --> 05:58.314
Perp was in full control.
Husband is down for the count.

05:58.358 --> 05:59.359
He could have raped her
in the bedroom,

05:59.402 --> 06:00.925
then dragged her over here

06:00.969 --> 06:03.798
in an attempt to wash away
the evidence before the shot.

06:05.887 --> 06:07.584
- Yo, Velasco.

06:07.628 --> 06:10.152
They have a teen daughter.

06:10.195 --> 06:11.240
- Huh.

06:11.283 --> 06:12.894
Unis didn't mention that.

06:12.937 --> 06:15.113
- Yeah, Priya Singh.

06:15.157 --> 06:17.942
- Packed in a hurry, dumped
her clothes in a trash bag.

06:22.294 --> 06:25.167
Now it's starting
to make sense.

06:25.210 --> 06:27.517
Immigrant family, dad
didn't approve of her dating.

06:27.561 --> 06:28.953
She gets the boyfriend
to shoot mom and dad

06:28.997 --> 06:30.433
before they run away together.
- OK.

06:30.477 --> 06:31.652
You're putting
a little too much emphasis

06:31.695 --> 06:33.218
on the birth control there,
hot shot.

06:33.262 --> 06:37.092
Sometimes young girls use them
to regulate their periods.

06:37.135 --> 06:38.485
- I know that.
- Yeah.

06:38.528 --> 06:40.051
- But then,
why hide it?

06:40.095 --> 06:41.705
- Like you said,
immigrant family.

06:41.749 --> 06:44.273
Pop is strict, old world,
wouldn't understand,

06:44.316 --> 06:48.016
so mom tells the girl
to hide them to keep the peace.

06:48.059 --> 06:52.455
But she didn't run away,
not without her phone.

06:52.499 --> 06:53.848
She was taken.

06:57.112 --> 06:58.461
- Priya Singh, 15.

06:58.505 --> 07:00.420
Her family moved to the U.S.
five years ago.

07:00.463 --> 07:02.117
She's now a sophomore
at Stuyvesant.

07:02.160 --> 07:04.162
- And we think that she's the
target of the home invasion?

07:04.206 --> 07:05.425
- It's starting
to look like it.

07:05.468 --> 07:06.687
- So the perp knew
she was home.

07:06.730 --> 07:08.079
- The restaurant was
under construction.

07:08.123 --> 07:09.298
No security cams.

07:09.341 --> 07:10.734
- CSU is checking
for touch DNA, prints.

07:10.778 --> 07:12.344
We canvassed,
but nobody heard anything,

07:12.388 --> 07:13.389
not even the gunshots.

07:13.433 --> 07:14.825
- Crime is on an upswing.

07:14.869 --> 07:17.524
Gunshots are the new soundtrack
of the city.

07:17.567 --> 07:19.308
- What about the parents?
How are they doing?

07:19.351 --> 07:20.744
- Still in surgery.

07:20.788 --> 07:23.443
- Anything on Priya's phone,
social media, friends?

07:23.486 --> 07:25.183
- So far,
no red flags.

07:25.227 --> 07:27.751
[phone buzzes]
- Excuse me, Cap.

07:27.795 --> 07:29.187
- If you ask me,
I think it's a good thing

07:29.231 --> 07:31.102
the guy emptied her drawers
and took some clothes.

07:31.146 --> 07:32.364
He's planning to keep her.

07:32.408 --> 07:34.410
It means there's a chance
she's still alive.

07:34.454 --> 07:36.412
- Good deduction.

07:36.456 --> 07:38.196
By the way,
nice jacket.

07:39.328 --> 07:41.939
- Mother's out of surgery.
She's asking for her daughter.

07:41.983 --> 07:43.593
- Great. Rollins.

07:48.380 --> 07:50.948
- My husband,
is he OK?

07:50.992 --> 07:52.428
- Your husband is alive.

07:52.472 --> 07:53.864
He's here in ICU.

07:53.908 --> 07:55.126
- And Priya?

07:55.170 --> 07:57.825
- She wasn't in the apartment,
Mrs. Singh.

07:57.868 --> 08:00.654
- No. He took her?

08:00.697 --> 08:03.874
Before he shot me,
he was asking where Priya was.

08:03.918 --> 08:05.746
- So he knew her name?
- Mm-hmm.

08:05.789 --> 08:07.487
- Did you get a look at him?

08:07.530 --> 08:10.794
- No, he was wearing a helmet

08:10.838 --> 08:12.927
that covered his face
and his eyes.

08:12.970 --> 08:15.364
- Can you describe
anything else about him?

08:15.407 --> 08:17.366
His race or his build?

08:17.409 --> 08:21.457
- He was a big man
with dirty hands.

08:21.501 --> 08:23.807
After I fell,
I noticed his boots.

08:23.851 --> 08:25.809
His boots,
they were very strange.

08:25.853 --> 08:28.986
They had some kind
of an apron on them.

08:29.030 --> 08:30.597
- OK.

08:30.640 --> 08:35.340
Have you had any men doing work
in your restaurant lately?

08:35.384 --> 08:37.560
- We had a contractor.

08:37.604 --> 08:40.432
But he and Rav had a fight,
and Rav fired him.

08:40.476 --> 08:43.174
- Did he tell you why?
- No.

08:43.218 --> 08:47.265
But that's why Rav has been
doing all of the work himself.

08:47.309 --> 08:49.398
- Yeah, I remember him.

08:49.441 --> 08:51.443
That restaurant job
down on 12th.

08:51.487 --> 08:54.272
The guy is a prick.
- How so?

08:54.316 --> 08:57.885
- That Indian guy wanted
his money back, all of it,

08:57.928 --> 09:01.018
just because him and one of my
day laborers got into a fight.

09:01.062 --> 09:02.324
- About what?

09:02.367 --> 09:03.760
- He claimed
he was looking at his daughter.

09:07.285 --> 09:09.766
- This laborer wouldn't happen
to be a welder, would he?

09:09.810 --> 09:11.899
- Yeah.
How'd you know?

09:13.640 --> 09:15.816
- OK, so we're looking
for a welder

09:15.859 --> 09:18.688
who became fixated with Priya,
kidnapped her.

09:18.732 --> 09:20.211
Do we have anything else
to go on?

09:20.255 --> 09:23.475
- Contractor I spoke to
gave me a first name--Elias.

09:23.519 --> 09:24.738
- And I can't find him

09:24.781 --> 09:26.391
through any other
local contracting companies.

09:26.435 --> 09:28.698
- And I called every trade
school in the tri-state area.

09:28.742 --> 09:30.613
No luck there.
- Got him.

09:30.657 --> 09:32.180
Elias Olsen, 34.

09:32.223 --> 09:34.356
Union says he hasn't
paid his dues since 2015.

09:34.399 --> 09:36.706
- Do we have a last known?
- Union sent his dues notices

09:36.750 --> 09:38.099
to an address
in Fishkill, New York.

09:38.142 --> 09:40.318
- Call the local sheriff,
have them meet us there.

09:40.362 --> 09:41.929
And everybody wears a vest.

09:41.972 --> 09:44.714
This guy shot two people
to get his hands on Priya.

09:44.758 --> 09:47.021
- No telling
what he'll do to keep her.

09:47.064 --> 09:49.893
[tense music]

09:49.937 --> 09:51.634
- It doesn't seem
like anybody's home.

09:51.678 --> 09:53.767
- OK.
Check around back.

09:53.810 --> 09:55.203
Did you run the house?

09:55.246 --> 09:56.900
- The utility bills
and the property taxes

09:56.944 --> 09:59.163
are paid by Soren Olsen,
the owner.

09:59.207 --> 10:00.687
He's Elias's father.

10:00.730 --> 10:02.427
- What do you know about Soren?
- Not a lot.

10:02.471 --> 10:03.690
He has no arrest records,

10:03.733 --> 10:05.779
and there's
no employment records either.

10:08.085 --> 10:09.913
- The light's on.

10:10.914 --> 10:13.047
- What's with the dollhouse?

10:14.657 --> 10:16.050
- Fresh tire tracks.

10:16.093 --> 10:17.660
- Check with the DMV.

10:17.704 --> 10:19.575
- These Olsen guys
don't have any kids, right?

10:19.619 --> 10:21.359
- Not that we know of. Why?

10:21.403 --> 10:22.970
- There's a dollhouse.

10:25.102 --> 10:27.627
- Ready to move
when you are, Captain.

10:27.670 --> 10:30.194
- We're going in now.

10:31.500 --> 10:32.980
Elias Olsen?

10:33.023 --> 10:35.069
NYPD.

10:35.112 --> 10:37.288
- Priya, it's the police.

10:37.332 --> 10:38.463
Can you hear us?

10:38.507 --> 10:40.204
- Go clear the woods out back.

10:40.248 --> 10:46.210
â™ª

10:52.129 --> 10:53.348
- Kitchen clear.

10:53.391 --> 10:54.654
- There's no sign of Elias.

10:54.697 --> 10:56.003
- I guess he didn't bring her
to the house.

10:56.046 --> 10:58.222
- Maybe he's on the run
with her.

10:58.266 --> 11:00.790
- Anybody home?

11:00.834 --> 11:02.139
I got something.
Open this door.

11:02.183 --> 11:03.184
Get me bolt cutters now.

11:08.232 --> 11:10.147
NYPD.

11:10.191 --> 11:11.322
- Hello?

11:11.366 --> 11:17.198
â™ª

11:20.941 --> 11:22.290
Priya?

11:22.333 --> 11:24.031
Captain.

11:24.074 --> 11:25.815
Hi.

11:25.859 --> 11:28.035
My name is Grace.
We're police officers.

11:34.650 --> 11:35.956
- [gasps]

11:38.045 --> 11:39.220
Hey.

11:40.787 --> 11:42.702
My name is Olivia.

11:42.745 --> 11:45.443
You're safe now.

11:45.487 --> 11:47.576
We're gonna take you home.

11:47.619 --> 11:49.491
It's OK.

11:49.534 --> 11:51.014
It's OK.

11:56.367 --> 11:56.585
.

11:56.628 --> 11:58.761
- Your name is Nadine, right?

11:58.805 --> 12:00.328
- We're gonna take you
to the hospital now, Nadine.

12:00.371 --> 12:03.287
- I'm not supposed to leave.

12:06.290 --> 12:09.076
- No one's gonna hurt you now.

12:09.119 --> 12:11.687
- Nadine,
we're gonna take care of you.

12:11.731 --> 12:13.297
Come with us.

12:13.341 --> 12:15.691
Just one step at a time.

12:15.735 --> 12:18.520
It's OK.
It's OK.

12:20.609 --> 12:21.523
There you go.

12:25.614 --> 12:29.618
Listen, you're gonna go
to the hospital now, all right?

12:29.661 --> 12:33.491
And Detective Rollins
is gonna ride with you.

12:33.535 --> 12:35.232
OK.

12:35.276 --> 12:37.757
- I'll be right there.
- OK.

12:40.063 --> 12:43.545
They've been locked in that
house for God knows how long.

12:43.588 --> 12:45.852
We need to ID them and find out
if they have any family.

12:45.895 --> 12:47.941
- We have approximate age.
We have first names.

12:47.984 --> 12:49.333
Nadine, Gillian...

12:49.377 --> 12:51.118
- If those are even
their real names.

12:51.161 --> 12:52.249
I mean,
I know it's a start.

12:52.293 --> 12:54.991
So we check missing persons,
NCMEC.

12:55.035 --> 12:56.514
We run the rapid DNA.

12:56.558 --> 12:59.691
- The little girl, Bella,
keeps calling Gillian "Mommy."

13:01.737 --> 13:03.913
- If that's true, she could
have been born in this house.

13:03.957 --> 13:05.436
- Rush her DNA as well.

13:05.480 --> 13:08.352
Muncy, you're gonna go
with them, all right?

13:08.396 --> 13:10.441
And after they both
get medical attention,

13:10.485 --> 13:11.834
you guys find out
if they can answer

13:11.878 --> 13:13.618
any questions about Elias.

13:13.662 --> 13:15.838
- So take a guess
what the neighbors said.

13:15.882 --> 13:18.362
Elias was quiet,
and he kept to himself.

13:18.406 --> 13:20.147
- Do we know anything
about this guy?

13:20.190 --> 13:22.192
Anything about the father,
Soren?

13:22.236 --> 13:24.804
- No one's seen him in a bit.
- It's real remote up here.

13:24.847 --> 13:26.936
- It's like the sheriff said.
There's not a lot on this guy.

13:26.980 --> 13:28.198
No credit cards, no cell.

13:28.242 --> 13:30.026
- He transported Priya here
last night.

13:30.070 --> 13:31.332
What about the vehicle?

13:31.375 --> 13:33.464
- DMV confirmed
it was a white Chevy pickup.

13:33.508 --> 13:34.944
We have alarms out.

13:34.988 --> 13:38.861
The plate numbers are
in the license plate readers.

13:38.905 --> 13:40.471
- It's been over 12 hours.

13:40.515 --> 13:41.951
He could be anywhere.

13:41.995 --> 13:44.301
- We'll find him, Liv.

13:46.869 --> 13:50.351
- No one talks to the press
until they talk to me.

13:54.921 --> 13:56.270
- Gillian Moore.

13:56.313 --> 13:58.663
She disappeared on vacation
from Virginia Beach

13:58.707 --> 14:00.709
12 years ago.
- I remember that case.

14:00.752 --> 14:03.146
Disappeared walking from the
beach to her parents' rental.

14:03.190 --> 14:04.669
- Mm-hmm.
- Heartbreaking.

14:04.713 --> 14:06.106
- Are the parents still alive?

14:06.149 --> 14:07.803
- Local PD
is alerting them now.

14:09.718 --> 14:10.762
- Nadine Chavez.

14:10.806 --> 14:12.329
Snatched off her bike
10 years ago

14:12.373 --> 14:13.853
in Upper Darby, Pennsylvania.

14:13.896 --> 14:15.898
Her parents were so devastated,
they moved back to Peru.

14:15.942 --> 14:17.378
And we're trying
to track them down now.

14:17.421 --> 14:18.509
- OK, what about
the little girl?

14:18.553 --> 14:20.207
- No missing persons report.

14:20.250 --> 14:22.209
Gillian is sticking to the
story that Belle is her child,

14:22.252 --> 14:23.819
so we're waiting on DNA.

14:23.863 --> 14:26.474
- And another thing,
Nadine is...

14:26.517 --> 14:28.824
three months pregnant.

14:30.913 --> 14:32.175
- Does she even know?

14:32.219 --> 14:34.351
- If she didn't,
she does now.

14:34.395 --> 14:36.701
The doctors say that
they're malnourished.

14:36.745 --> 14:38.921
There's evidence of healed
injuries, sexual assault,

14:38.965 --> 14:42.707
and no medical
or dental work for years.

14:44.274 --> 14:46.450
- OK.
What about Priya?

14:46.494 --> 14:49.018
- Dazed and scared,
but not physically hurt.

14:49.062 --> 14:50.324
- OK, so go talk to her.

14:50.367 --> 14:52.456
She was the last one
to see Elias.

14:54.328 --> 14:57.026
- I woke up.

14:57.070 --> 15:00.856
And I heard my mom...

15:00.900 --> 15:04.033
screaming my name,

15:04.077 --> 15:05.382
then a loud shot.

15:05.426 --> 15:06.775
Is she OK?
- Yeah.

15:06.818 --> 15:08.211
She's OK, Priya.

15:08.255 --> 15:11.258
And the doctors are
taking good care of your dad.

15:11.301 --> 15:13.825
- Can I see them, please?
- Soon.

15:15.392 --> 15:20.397
But right now, we need help
catching the guy who took you.

15:20.441 --> 15:22.617
So can you tell me
what happened?

15:24.401 --> 15:26.490
- He--

15:26.534 --> 15:31.582
he threw me
in the back of his truck,

15:31.626 --> 15:35.586
told me to--
to stay down.

15:38.633 --> 15:43.029
I begged him
to take me back, cried.

15:46.119 --> 15:48.817
But...

15:48.860 --> 15:53.039
any time I said something, he--

15:53.082 --> 15:56.433
he would just tell me,

15:56.477 --> 16:00.002
"Good girls get good things.

16:00.046 --> 16:03.397
Bad girls get bad things."

16:03.440 --> 16:07.227
After that, I--
I just stopped talking.

16:07.270 --> 16:08.489
- Yeah.

16:15.626 --> 16:17.019
- That's Elias.

16:17.063 --> 16:18.412
Is he here?
- No, no.

16:18.455 --> 16:20.370
No, I meant what I said.
You're safe here.

16:20.414 --> 16:22.633
No one is going
to hurt you, OK?

16:22.677 --> 16:24.374
- Where is he, then?

16:24.418 --> 16:26.507
- Well,
that's what we're working on.

16:26.550 --> 16:29.336
When is the last time
you saw him?

16:29.379 --> 16:31.816
- I don't know.
Before you came.

16:31.860 --> 16:33.427
- OK.
Do you know where he was going?

16:33.470 --> 16:36.647
- No, but he was in a hurry.

16:36.691 --> 16:38.475
He brought the new girl
downstairs,

16:38.519 --> 16:40.564
locked her up with us,
said, "Teach her."

16:40.608 --> 16:41.826
- Teach her what?

16:41.870 --> 16:43.872
- The rules.

16:43.915 --> 16:46.396
There's only two.

16:46.440 --> 16:52.054
Good girls get good things,
and bad girls get bad things.

16:54.361 --> 16:57.277
- We got locked up
in the basement.

16:57.320 --> 17:00.019
That only happens
when Elias goes out.

17:00.062 --> 17:01.020
- OK.

17:02.717 --> 17:07.026
Gillian, do you know
when that was?

17:08.418 --> 17:09.941
- I'm trying to think.

17:11.726 --> 17:15.338
I never knew
what day or month it was.

17:15.382 --> 17:19.777
It just always
felt like forever.

17:21.214 --> 17:22.737
All the time.

17:25.566 --> 17:26.871
Sorry.
- Gillian, no.

17:26.915 --> 17:28.525
Gillian. Gillian.
- I'm so sorry.

17:28.569 --> 17:31.398
- You never have to apologize
to me or anyone.

17:31.441 --> 17:33.008
- I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

17:33.052 --> 17:34.575
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- It's OK.

17:34.618 --> 17:36.055
- I'm so sorry.

17:36.098 --> 17:38.187
I'm so sorry.
- It's OK. It's OK.

17:38.231 --> 17:40.102
It's OK.
It's OK.

17:40.146 --> 17:42.626
Your mom's gonna be OK,
sweetheart.

17:44.585 --> 17:47.544
- She's not a big talker,

17:47.588 --> 17:48.980
because it's safer
to stay quiet.

17:49.024 --> 17:51.896
Right, Bella?
What's the rule?

17:51.940 --> 17:54.247
- Be a good girl.

17:54.290 --> 17:57.989
- You are a good, good girl.

17:58.033 --> 18:00.862
- Elias
just disappears sometimes.

18:00.905 --> 18:03.908
- And when he disappears,
are you left alone?

18:03.952 --> 18:06.085
- I don't want
to talk to you anymore.

18:06.128 --> 18:07.216
Where's Gillian?

18:07.260 --> 18:08.957
- Gillian's here
at the hospital.

18:09.000 --> 18:10.567
She's safe,
just like you.

18:10.611 --> 18:12.787
[stammers]

18:12.830 --> 18:15.920
- I'm not feeling well.
I don't want to talk anymore.

18:15.964 --> 18:16.921
- OK.

18:18.575 --> 18:22.579
- It was pitch black
in the basement.

18:22.623 --> 18:24.625
I was scared.

18:24.668 --> 18:27.497
- I'm so sorry
that happened to you.

18:27.541 --> 18:30.152
- I was quiet by then.

18:30.196 --> 18:32.763
He said I was a good girl,

18:32.807 --> 18:35.853
that he would
bring me some treats.

18:42.164 --> 18:44.601
- Hey.
You get anything from Nadine?

18:44.645 --> 18:46.037
- Before she shut down?

18:46.081 --> 18:48.127
I got a full description
of Elias, what he's wearing.

18:48.170 --> 18:50.129
- OK, great.
We'll get that out wide.

18:50.172 --> 18:52.957
- Captain, he's using food
as a tool of control.

18:53.001 --> 18:54.176
- Good girls get good things.

18:54.220 --> 18:55.786
- It's called
operant conditioning.

18:55.830 --> 18:57.745
- Ah, the kitchen was empty.

18:57.788 --> 18:59.138
Nothing in the cupboards,
fridge.

18:59.181 --> 19:01.270
- So coordinate
with Fin and Velasco.

19:01.314 --> 19:04.795
I want an airship looking
for that white Chevy

19:04.839 --> 19:06.928
in every
supermarket parking lot

19:06.971 --> 19:08.669
within spitting distance
of Fishkill.

19:08.712 --> 19:10.192
- On it, Captain.

19:10.236 --> 19:13.152
[tense music]

19:13.195 --> 19:20.159
â™ª

19:24.032 --> 19:26.556
- This one?

19:26.600 --> 19:29.211
Or this one?

19:29.255 --> 19:30.952
- Elias Olsen. NYPD.

19:30.995 --> 19:32.258
- Hands where we can see them.

19:32.301 --> 19:33.955
- Get on the ground now.

19:33.998 --> 19:35.261
- Hey! Stop!

19:37.263 --> 19:39.656
[both grunting]

19:39.700 --> 19:41.571
- I got you,
you sick bastard.

19:41.615 --> 19:43.747
- [straining]
Get her off of me!

19:43.791 --> 19:45.880
Get her off of me.
- Stop. Stop.

19:45.923 --> 19:47.229
- Come on, Muncy.
Come on.

19:47.273 --> 19:48.491
Come on.
Take it easy.

19:48.535 --> 19:50.406
- Get him up.
Get him up.

19:50.450 --> 19:53.148
Elias Olsen,
you're under arrest.

19:53.192 --> 19:54.367
- It wasn't me.

19:54.410 --> 19:55.498
- Then who was it?

19:55.542 --> 19:57.500
- It was my daddy.

19:57.544 --> 20:04.725
â™ª

20:08.772 --> 20:09.208
.

20:09.251 --> 20:11.558
- He's blaming the father?
- Yeah, Soren.

20:11.601 --> 20:13.342
- OK. Any intel
on where this guy might be?

20:13.386 --> 20:16.127
- No credit cards,
no cell phone.

20:16.171 --> 20:17.955
And this guy is smarter
than he looks.

20:17.999 --> 20:19.522
He wanted to wait
on his lawyer.

20:19.566 --> 20:21.394
- Well, his lawyer
is gonna salivate

20:21.437 --> 20:23.787
when he sees
that lump on his head.

20:23.831 --> 20:25.180
What the hell happened?

20:25.224 --> 20:26.486
- I don't want
to cause any trouble,

20:26.529 --> 20:28.879
but it was
your little rescue, Muncy.

20:28.923 --> 20:30.490
- Muncy did that?
- Yeah.

20:30.533 --> 20:32.709
She went all gang unit
on his ass.

20:32.753 --> 20:35.364
Broke one of our radios
on his head.

20:35.408 --> 20:37.540
- OK, I assume
you got him medical attention.

20:37.584 --> 20:39.499
- Just got released
by a doctor.

20:39.542 --> 20:41.588
I don't want to take
any chances on this one.

20:41.631 --> 20:45.069
- Well, he has a thing
for young girls.

20:45.113 --> 20:49.073
When Muncy comes back, have her
go in there and apologize.

20:49.117 --> 20:51.554
- So you got him?

20:51.598 --> 20:55.384
- We just have a few photos
for Priya to look at.

20:55.428 --> 20:57.125
- I don't want
to see him again.

20:57.168 --> 20:59.432
- He can't hurt you
ever again, Priya.

21:09.964 --> 21:11.270
- That's him.

21:13.620 --> 21:15.752
- What happens now?
- We have him in custody.

21:15.796 --> 21:17.537
He's gonna be questioned,
arraigned.

21:17.580 --> 21:19.582
- This guy's going away
for a long time.

21:19.626 --> 21:22.846
- Good news. Mrs. Singh,
your husband's awake.

21:22.890 --> 21:24.239
- Oh!
[phone buzzes]

21:24.283 --> 21:26.720
[laughter]

21:33.857 --> 21:35.337
- Everything OK?
- Yeah.

21:35.381 --> 21:37.426
Elias' lawyer showed up.

21:37.470 --> 21:39.733
Benson wants me
to interrogate him.

21:39.776 --> 21:41.735
- Looks like that blazer
is doing its job.

21:41.778 --> 21:43.345
The question is, can you?

21:46.000 --> 21:47.610
- Detective Muncy,

21:47.654 --> 21:49.873
thanks for freeing up some time
from your busy schedule.

21:49.917 --> 21:51.745
- Is this the woman
who assaulted my client?

21:51.788 --> 21:52.920
- You hit me.

21:52.963 --> 21:54.791
I had to get eight stitches.

21:54.835 --> 21:55.966
- I know.

21:56.010 --> 21:57.228
I'm so sorry about that.

21:57.272 --> 22:00.188
I hope you're OK.

22:00.231 --> 22:03.104
- It's OK.
I got a hard head.

22:03.147 --> 22:06.455
- Well, my client is here
talking, of his own accord.

22:06.499 --> 22:08.979
- That mean
he's ready to cooperate?

22:09.023 --> 22:10.503
Our vic ID'd your client,

22:10.546 --> 22:13.332
and his gun was a match
to the one used on the Singhs.

22:13.375 --> 22:16.204
- Elias, you shot two people.

22:16.247 --> 22:18.467
And you kidnapped
a 15-year-old girl.

22:18.511 --> 22:20.164
- No one's denying that.

22:20.208 --> 22:22.123
But I understand
both victims recovered.

22:22.166 --> 22:24.168
- I didn't...

22:24.212 --> 22:26.257
you know,
touch that girl.

22:26.301 --> 22:28.347
I didn't.

22:28.390 --> 22:29.913
I didn't. I...

22:31.480 --> 22:34.222
- You know what?
I believe you.

22:35.702 --> 22:38.008
OK?

22:38.052 --> 22:41.708
You were buying ice cream
when we picked you up.

22:43.057 --> 22:45.320
For Priya?

22:45.364 --> 22:48.236
- She was good.

22:48.279 --> 22:49.498
- My client is another victim.

22:49.542 --> 22:51.500
- We pulled two women
and a little girl out

22:51.544 --> 22:53.415
of a padlocked basement,

22:53.459 --> 22:56.026
and the keys were in his pocket
when we cuffed him.

22:56.070 --> 22:57.506
- It wasn't me!

23:01.467 --> 23:04.339
- It was your father,
right, you said?

23:04.383 --> 23:06.385
Soren?

23:06.428 --> 23:09.083
Where is he now?

23:09.126 --> 23:10.258
- Hunting.

23:12.869 --> 23:14.654
- When is he coming back?

23:14.697 --> 23:17.047
- I don't know.
He drives around.

23:17.091 --> 23:18.397
- Where?

23:18.440 --> 23:20.573
- Different places.

23:20.616 --> 23:23.793
- Why'd you take Priya?

23:23.837 --> 23:25.839
- I wanted to...

23:25.882 --> 23:27.536
make him proud of me.

23:27.580 --> 23:30.539
- Let's call this
what it was--coercion.

23:30.583 --> 23:33.237
Elias Olsen was held captive,
just like those women.

23:33.281 --> 23:36.980
- Yet somehow, he was able
to do odd jobs as a welder?

23:37.024 --> 23:39.200
- He's the victim
of lifelong physical,

23:39.243 --> 23:40.723
educational,
and emotional neglect.

23:40.767 --> 23:41.855
- Ooh.

23:41.898 --> 23:43.726
Pay attention, Muncy.

23:43.770 --> 23:44.945
You're about
to learn the difference

23:44.988 --> 23:47.164
between a bad lawyer
and a good lawyer.

23:47.208 --> 23:51.255
You see, a bad lawyer can
drag a case out for years.

23:51.299 --> 23:55.346
A good lawyer knows
how to drag it out even longer.

23:55.390 --> 23:56.652
- From what my client tells me,

23:56.696 --> 23:59.089
these women were given
full run of the house

23:59.133 --> 24:00.482
whenever he was home.

24:00.526 --> 24:02.528
They had ample opportunity
to escape over the years,

24:02.571 --> 24:04.878
and yet they didn't,
not once.

24:04.921 --> 24:07.924
- Yeah, well,
not all chains are physical.

24:09.796 --> 24:12.842
- And I might say the same
for my client.

24:12.886 --> 24:15.105
[tense music]

24:15.149 --> 24:18.587
â™ª

24:18.631 --> 24:22.373
- OK, this guy, Carter,
is pretty slick.

24:22.417 --> 24:23.462
- And she's green.

24:23.505 --> 24:25.159
- Imagine
what he'll do to a jury.

24:25.202 --> 24:27.248
- If it goes to trial,
Carisi will rip him up.

24:27.291 --> 24:30.643
- Soren is out there somewhere
hunting other girls.

24:34.647 --> 24:36.431
Where are Gillian
and Nadine now?

24:36.475 --> 24:38.955
- They just got transferred
to Bellevue.

24:38.999 --> 24:41.828
- You know, the walls in that
house that they were locked in

24:41.871 --> 24:43.525
were pretty thin.

24:43.569 --> 24:46.006
Maybe they heard something
about Soren's road trip.

24:50.140 --> 24:52.491
- Yeah, it's sick, but...

24:52.534 --> 24:55.232
Soren calls it hunting.

24:55.276 --> 24:57.104
- So, Gillian, who took you?

24:57.147 --> 25:00.194
Was it Elias?
- No.

25:00.237 --> 25:03.066
Elias is big, but
I've never seen him be violent.

25:03.110 --> 25:04.328
- Are you sure?

25:04.372 --> 25:05.982
Because he shot two people
yesterday.

25:06.026 --> 25:08.289
- Soren is the one
that took me--

25:08.332 --> 25:09.856
alone.

25:09.899 --> 25:12.467
I was coming back
from the beach.

25:12.511 --> 25:14.643
He was kneeling by a car,

25:14.687 --> 25:17.080
said his cat was hiding
underneath it.

25:17.124 --> 25:20.301
And I stopped to help.

25:20.344 --> 25:22.172
And then he threw me
in the trunk.

25:22.216 --> 25:23.522
- [sighs]

25:23.565 --> 25:25.524
That must have been
so frightening.

25:28.091 --> 25:29.702
- He broke my fingers
that first night

25:29.745 --> 25:32.618
to teach me the rules,

25:32.661 --> 25:36.796
and then my ankles once
when I tried to escape.

25:42.410 --> 25:45.456
[indistinct chatter]

25:45.500 --> 25:48.808
But after a while
of being good,

25:48.851 --> 25:52.420
he allowed me to keep Bella.

25:54.030 --> 25:56.990
She's the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

25:59.253 --> 26:01.429
She kept me sane.

26:07.827 --> 26:10.699
- Gillian.

26:10.743 --> 26:13.615
Where does Soren go hunting?

26:20.274 --> 26:24.539
- Soren would make us have sex
with him, like, all the time.

26:24.583 --> 26:26.889
- And what about Elias?

26:26.933 --> 26:28.717
- He never tried to touch us.

26:28.761 --> 26:32.025
He knew we were
Soren's property, not his.

26:32.068 --> 26:35.594
- When is the last time
you saw Soren?

26:37.987 --> 26:39.946
- I don't know.

26:39.989 --> 26:42.252
But when he would
go out hunting,

26:42.296 --> 26:43.863
Elias was in charge.

26:43.906 --> 26:47.867
- Did he say
where he was going hunting?

26:51.653 --> 26:54.525
- I don't--I don't know.
- You don't know?

26:56.876 --> 26:58.660
How long ago did he leave?

26:58.704 --> 27:03.186
- A month or two.

27:03.230 --> 27:07.277
Time passes weird for us.

27:07.321 --> 27:09.366
[door rattles]

27:09.410 --> 27:11.020
No, please!
No closed doors!

27:11.064 --> 27:13.719
- It's OK. It's OK.
- I'm so sorry.

27:13.762 --> 27:16.286
- It's OK.
It's OK.

27:16.330 --> 27:19.246
Look. See?
No closed doors.

27:19.289 --> 27:20.247
It's OK.

27:21.988 --> 27:23.119
Hey.

27:23.163 --> 27:24.904
- Fin and Velasco are back
in Fishkill.

27:24.947 --> 27:26.732
- Cadaver dogs find something?

27:26.775 --> 27:29.691
- Let's hope not, but what
did you learn from Nadine?

27:29.735 --> 27:31.127
- Only that
she's being evasive.

27:31.171 --> 27:34.130
- Well, I can understand why.
The DNA came back.

27:34.174 --> 27:37.177
Elias and Bella
are brother and sister.

27:37.220 --> 27:40.441
- Which means
Soren is Bella's father.

27:40.484 --> 27:44.619
He raped Gillian--Nadine too--
for over a decade.

27:44.663 --> 27:46.577
- Where is this guy?

27:51.321 --> 27:53.715
- The dog alerted in this area
of the yard about an hour ago.

27:53.759 --> 27:55.369
- So what did you find?

27:55.412 --> 27:58.024
- A white male.
I'd say about 60.

27:58.067 --> 28:03.333
â™ª

28:03.377 --> 28:06.162
- Well, it looks like
Soren won't be coming back.

28:06.206 --> 28:09.122
[dog barking]

28:17.521 --> 28:17.696
.

28:17.739 --> 28:19.045
- Advanced decomposition.

28:19.088 --> 28:20.350
The weather's been warm.

28:20.394 --> 28:23.136
The body has been buried
for at least six weeks.

28:23.179 --> 28:26.008
Found a gunshot
in the south occipital region.

28:26.052 --> 28:27.618
- OK.
So you're ruling it a homicide?

28:27.662 --> 28:29.795
- Well, I'm assuming
he didn't shoot himself

28:29.838 --> 28:31.057
in the back of the head.
- Ah.

28:31.100 --> 28:32.928
You should be a detective.

28:32.972 --> 28:34.451
- What else can you tell us?

28:34.495 --> 28:36.279
- The bullet was fired
at a low angle.

28:36.323 --> 28:39.630
And then,
we have our second body,

28:39.674 --> 28:42.459
what the dog alerted to
from across the yard.

28:42.503 --> 28:45.114
Skeletal remains of a newborn.

28:45.158 --> 28:47.638
- Another homicide?
- Hard to tell.

28:47.682 --> 28:50.337
Decomp is faster in newborns.
Less fat.

28:50.380 --> 28:54.471
But the hyoid bone
is splintered.

28:54.515 --> 28:56.604
If I had to hazard a guess,
I'd say he was choked

28:56.647 --> 28:58.693
and in the ground
for at least a few years.

28:58.737 --> 29:00.086
- He?

29:00.129 --> 29:03.089
- Baby boys have
a more defined brow ridge,

29:03.132 --> 29:04.264
prominent cheekbones.
- Two women

29:04.307 --> 29:05.831
were imprisoned in that house,

29:05.874 --> 29:07.441
so either one of them could
have been the boy's mother.

29:07.484 --> 29:08.921
- That might explain
the evasiveness

29:08.964 --> 29:10.313
I was picking up from Nadine.

29:10.357 --> 29:13.316
- Bad girls get bad things.

29:13.360 --> 29:15.101
Well, you can't blame her
for not wanting

29:15.144 --> 29:17.277
to talk about the murder
of her infant son.

29:17.320 --> 29:18.757
- If it's even hers.

29:20.323 --> 29:22.499
- We're gonna need DNA.

29:22.543 --> 29:25.154
- There's something else
that might interest you.

29:25.198 --> 29:26.939
The baby's burial
was respectful,

29:26.982 --> 29:29.768
unlike Mr. Olsen's grave.

29:29.811 --> 29:32.771
[tense music]

29:32.814 --> 29:36.731
â™ª

29:41.867 --> 29:44.521
- No, no.

29:44.565 --> 29:47.394
Daddy is dead?
What happened?

29:47.437 --> 29:50.049
- Are you gonna pretend
you don't know?

29:50.092 --> 29:51.833
The slug
in his cranial cavity

29:51.877 --> 29:54.488
matches the one
you shot the Singhs with.

29:54.531 --> 29:56.185
- My client didn't
shoot his own father.

29:56.229 --> 30:00.015
- Well, like you said,
Elias was terrorized.

30:00.059 --> 30:02.409
- All the more reason
to kill him.

30:02.452 --> 30:05.020
We know he's capable.
He shot two people.

30:05.064 --> 30:06.500
- I never would
have hurt my daddy.

30:06.543 --> 30:09.720
- The problem we're having,
Elias, it was your gun.

30:09.764 --> 30:12.723
So can you explain that?

30:12.767 --> 30:15.683
- One of the girls
must have got in my room.

30:15.726 --> 30:17.163
They sneak around.

30:17.206 --> 30:18.991
- I thought you kept them
locked up when you went out.

30:19.034 --> 30:20.514
- They're tricky.

30:20.557 --> 30:22.298
[voice breaks]
I'm telling you.

30:24.344 --> 30:26.172
[sobbing] No.

30:26.215 --> 30:28.565
I didn't.

30:28.609 --> 30:31.742
I was just trying
to make him proud of me.

30:31.786 --> 30:33.222
I...

30:33.266 --> 30:36.486
What am I supposed to do
without him?

30:38.445 --> 30:41.100
- We have nothing further
to discuss.

30:43.624 --> 30:46.627
- The Dutchess County DA
wants an update on the case.

30:46.670 --> 30:49.586
I mean, certainly,
Elias is guilty of a lot--

30:49.630 --> 30:52.807
attempted murder,
abduction, confinement,

30:52.851 --> 30:54.504
but patricide?

30:54.548 --> 30:56.202
- What are we,
in ancient Greece?

30:56.245 --> 30:58.465
- Look, it was his gun.

30:58.508 --> 31:00.467
We have a ballistics match.

31:00.510 --> 31:03.687
There's no other DNA
or prints on the weapon.

31:03.731 --> 31:06.212
And there's no alibi
at the time of the crime.

31:06.255 --> 31:08.083
- But we don't have
a confession either.

31:08.127 --> 31:10.607
- The opposite, really.
The guy was crying like a baby.

31:10.651 --> 31:12.479
- He's only crying
'cause he got caught.

31:12.522 --> 31:14.873
- What's Elias, 6'2"?

31:14.916 --> 31:16.396
The ME did specify

31:16.439 --> 31:20.400
that the entry wound came
from a low trajectory.

31:20.443 --> 31:22.358
- Well, how tall are the women?

31:22.402 --> 31:24.360
- Gillian and Nadine?
They're under 5'5".

31:24.404 --> 31:29.191
- Look, these women
have been through enough.

31:30.018 --> 31:33.456
So I would prefer not to open
an investigation against them

31:33.500 --> 31:34.849
if we don't have to.

31:34.893 --> 31:37.547
- You have an open homicide,
Captain Benson.

31:37.591 --> 31:40.811
And as long as that's true,
you have an open case.

31:43.727 --> 31:44.685
- Yeah.

31:44.728 --> 31:46.905
- Soren is dead?

31:46.948 --> 31:48.167
Are you sure?

31:48.210 --> 31:49.646
- We found his body.

31:49.690 --> 31:52.693
He was shot
in the back of the head.

31:52.736 --> 31:56.305
Do you know anything
about that?

31:56.349 --> 31:58.829
- I know Elias has a gun.

32:00.614 --> 32:02.268
- OK.

32:02.311 --> 32:05.662
Did you see Elias shoot Soren?

32:05.706 --> 32:06.794
- No.

32:08.361 --> 32:11.407
- We also found...

32:11.451 --> 32:15.150
the body of a--

32:15.194 --> 32:18.240
a baby boy
buried in the yard.

32:18.284 --> 32:21.765
He was wrapped
in a blanket.

32:21.809 --> 32:25.465
Somebody who loved him
buried him like that.

32:27.902 --> 32:32.515
- Soren said he already had
too many mouths to feed.

32:32.559 --> 32:35.170
He said our food
was too expensive,

32:35.214 --> 32:38.347
so he broke his neck.

32:39.827 --> 32:43.048
He killed my baby.

32:43.091 --> 32:44.919
- And you buried him?

32:47.226 --> 32:49.837
- Me and Nadine,

32:49.880 --> 32:54.015
we buried her baby boy together
about two years ago.

32:54.059 --> 32:55.712
- Mm.

32:55.756 --> 32:58.846
OK, and, um...

32:58.889 --> 33:00.413
and what about Soren?

33:02.328 --> 33:04.417
- What about him?

33:04.460 --> 33:07.072
- Who buried him?

33:07.115 --> 33:11.076
- It must have been Elias,
after he shot him.

33:11.119 --> 33:13.774
Because he tried to kill
that Indian girl's parents,

33:13.817 --> 33:15.341
didn't he?

33:15.384 --> 33:16.516
- He did,

33:16.559 --> 33:19.214
but
the medical examiner thought

33:19.258 --> 33:20.563
that Soren was shot

33:20.607 --> 33:24.263
by somebody much shorter
than Elias.

33:24.306 --> 33:25.916
- How do they know that?

33:25.960 --> 33:28.789
- From the angle
that the bullet entered.

33:31.444 --> 33:34.403
- Maybe it was
that Indian girl

33:34.447 --> 33:35.752
'cause she was really upset

33:35.796 --> 33:38.016
over what happened
to her mom and dad.

33:40.018 --> 33:41.454
- Yeah.

33:41.497 --> 33:45.545
That is a good--
that's a good theory, Gillian.

33:45.588 --> 33:49.288
But the timeline
doesn't add up.

33:50.637 --> 33:54.684
So if Soren
didn't shoot himself

33:54.728 --> 33:58.253
and Elias didn't shoot him,

33:58.297 --> 34:01.343
we know
that Priya didn't shoot him.

34:01.387 --> 34:03.519
So that leaves--
- It was me.

34:05.043 --> 34:08.829
- Elias didn't shoot Soren,
did he?

34:11.049 --> 34:12.354
- No.

34:16.141 --> 34:17.403
I did.

34:18.795 --> 34:20.319
I shot him.

34:21.885 --> 34:24.105
- I shot him.

34:24.149 --> 34:25.802
It was self-defense.

34:28.283 --> 34:30.198
- They both confessed?

34:30.242 --> 34:33.158
- Is it possible that Nadine
and Gillian did it together?

34:33.201 --> 34:35.116
- Well, they're definitely
protecting each other.

34:35.160 --> 34:36.335
- Yeah.

34:40.208 --> 34:42.384
- Or somebody else.

34:49.565 --> 34:49.957
.

34:50.000 --> 34:54.788
So, Bella, I know that
you're supposed to be good.

34:54.831 --> 34:56.529
- Good girls
aren't supposed to talk.

34:56.572 --> 34:57.747
- I know.
I know.

34:57.791 --> 35:01.403
So I'm just gonna ask you
a few questions.

35:01.447 --> 35:02.448
That's it.

35:02.491 --> 35:06.669
And you can just
nod yes or no, OK?

35:06.713 --> 35:08.454
All right.

35:10.151 --> 35:14.286
Bella, did you know
that Soren was dead?

35:14.329 --> 35:16.940
That he was buried
in the backyard?

35:16.984 --> 35:18.507
That somebody had shot him?

35:22.816 --> 35:24.252
Was it Nadine?

35:26.950 --> 35:28.822
Was it your mom?

35:32.217 --> 35:34.262
Honey, did you know that--

35:34.306 --> 35:37.657
that Nadine was gonna
have another baby?

35:37.700 --> 35:40.834
- [sobbing]

35:45.491 --> 35:49.843
- And, sweetheart,
just one final question, OK?

35:51.845 --> 35:55.414
Did you know
where Elias kept his gun?

35:55.457 --> 35:58.417
[tense music]

35:58.460 --> 36:03.987
â™ª

36:15.912 --> 36:17.218
- What happened?

36:17.262 --> 36:19.046
Did you get some hot sauce
on your sleeve?

36:19.089 --> 36:22.049
- Nah, it's a speck of blood.

36:22.092 --> 36:23.746
- What,
from that big guy's head?

36:23.790 --> 36:25.792
- Yeah, I probably
shouldn't have

36:25.835 --> 36:27.924
thrown my radio at him
like that.

36:27.968 --> 36:30.927
- You ever heard
the policeman's prayer?

36:30.971 --> 36:33.843
"Lord, get me out of this one,
and I'll never do it again"?

36:33.887 --> 36:35.715
- [chuckles]

36:35.758 --> 36:37.586
That's a good one.

36:37.630 --> 36:39.936
I just don't want
to wind up on YouTube.

36:39.980 --> 36:41.199
- You know,
back in my day,

36:41.242 --> 36:44.027
we used to rough guys up
all the time.

36:44.071 --> 36:46.856
But this is not about YouTube.

36:46.900 --> 36:49.729
You got to learn
to think more tactically.

36:49.772 --> 36:52.732
- Yeah, I'm lucky I didn't
take that guy's eye out.

36:52.775 --> 36:54.690
- I don't care about that.

36:54.734 --> 36:57.345
I'm concerned with you.

36:57.389 --> 37:01.262
You got to protect yourself
in case we're not there.

37:01.306 --> 37:04.265
What if things went real bad
and you needed that radio?

37:06.572 --> 37:07.790
And trust me.

37:07.834 --> 37:09.357
You don't want a guy
like Carter

37:09.401 --> 37:12.012
taking you apart on the stand.

37:13.100 --> 37:15.537
- Copy that, Sarge.

37:15.581 --> 37:19.149
Hey, this tough love thing,
did Benson put you up to it?

37:19.193 --> 37:22.588
- No, this was my idea.

37:24.285 --> 37:25.852
- But she knows, right?

37:25.895 --> 37:28.071
- Oh, yeah.
She knows.

37:28.115 --> 37:30.073
- Is she pissed?

37:30.117 --> 37:32.772
- Listen,
if Benson is pissed,

37:32.815 --> 37:35.383
you'll know about it.

37:35.427 --> 37:36.689
Good night.

37:36.732 --> 37:41.171
- So both Gillian and Nadine
have confessed?

37:41.215 --> 37:44.044
- And they're
obviously both lying.

37:44.087 --> 37:45.872
- And Elias?

37:45.915 --> 37:47.917
- Elias didn't do it.

37:47.961 --> 37:49.310
- So you have no suspects?

37:49.354 --> 37:52.139
No suspects whatsoever?

37:54.968 --> 37:57.449
- Look, all I know

37:57.492 --> 38:02.236
is that Soren murdered
Nadine's baby two years ago.

38:02.280 --> 38:05.283
And now,
Nadine is pregnant again.

38:07.328 --> 38:10.157
- So it would seem likely
that whoever shot Soren

38:10.200 --> 38:13.334
did so to protect this baby.
- Yes.

38:15.075 --> 38:20.080
That seems like
the most likely scenario.

38:21.211 --> 38:24.432
- And this is where you tell me
you haven't the foggiest notion

38:24.476 --> 38:28.436
of who that good Samaritan
might be, isn't it?

38:33.746 --> 38:38.446
I believe this is what we call
a stalemate in chess.

38:40.361 --> 38:42.972
I think I've been clear
with you, haven't I?

38:43.016 --> 38:44.670
An open homicide means

38:44.713 --> 38:46.933
that your case
remains open forever.

38:46.976 --> 38:49.718
- Yes, of course.

38:49.762 --> 38:53.113
And if the investigation
turns up a viable suspect,

38:53.156 --> 38:57.030
you will be the first to know.

38:57.073 --> 38:59.337
- OK.

38:59.380 --> 39:01.687
We understand each other.

39:05.386 --> 39:09.477
But, Captain,
justice may be blind,

39:09.521 --> 39:13.046
but she's not
entirely heartless.

39:16.049 --> 39:18.312
And you'll see
how heartless I can be

39:18.356 --> 39:21.837
should this conversation
ever come back to haunt me.

39:21.881 --> 39:28.583
â™ª

39:30.106 --> 39:32.370
- So Maxwell just let it go?

39:32.413 --> 39:34.720
- Well, "let it go" is
a generous way to phrase it,

39:34.763 --> 39:36.504
but yeah,
she made it clear

39:36.548 --> 39:40.203
that she will not pursue
Soren's homicide unless we do.

39:40.247 --> 39:42.554
- And we're not.

39:42.597 --> 39:45.687
Carisi tells me that Elias'
attorney pled not guilty.

39:45.731 --> 39:48.255
- This is going to trial?

39:48.298 --> 39:51.693
Those women have
to take the stand.

39:51.737 --> 39:56.959
- I just want to say goodbye
and thank you.

39:57.003 --> 39:59.484
Bella and I are going home
to my mother's house.

39:59.527 --> 40:01.703
- I'm so glad to hear that.

40:01.747 --> 40:06.578
And you know that we're here
if you need anything.

40:06.621 --> 40:08.580
And that goes
for you too, Bella.

40:10.582 --> 40:14.586
- I almost don't want to leave
because it's so safe here.

40:18.590 --> 40:20.679
How am I supposed
to walk out that door

40:20.722 --> 40:22.332
knowing what's out there?

40:23.769 --> 40:26.685
- Gillian, you know,

40:26.728 --> 40:32.299
there's also so much good
out there in the world too--

40:32.342 --> 40:36.999
your freedom,
your family,

40:37.043 --> 40:41.917
your whole life ahead of you.

40:41.961 --> 40:43.702
You go live it.

40:46.139 --> 40:48.141
- I'll go with you, Mommy.

40:52.711 --> 40:53.755
- Okay.

40:55.801 --> 40:56.932
Bye.
