WEBVTT

00:04.481 --> 00:06.015
VANESSA:
Eve just called.

00:06.048 --> 00:08.351
She and Kristin
will be here any minute.

00:08.385 --> 00:09.786
Crap.

00:09.819 --> 00:13.356
Wh-What'd you think
the banner was for, Kyle?

00:13.390 --> 00:16.058
Uh, no, no.

00:16.092 --> 00:17.760
I'm-I'm trying to DVR
my favorite show,

00:17.794 --> 00:19.028
but it's not on.

00:19.061 --> 00:21.431
Oh, well,
maybe it got canceled.

00:22.665 --> 00:23.800
You know, the TV business

00:23.833 --> 00:26.002
can be a heartless bastard.

00:27.003 --> 00:29.205
Canceled? Why would they cancel

00:29.238 --> 00:31.808
a popular show
that everybody loves?

00:31.841 --> 00:33.576
(mouthing)

00:33.610 --> 00:35.745
Maybe they're a bunch of idiots.

00:40.583 --> 00:43.252
-Just try another channel.
-Oh, Mike. (scoffs)

00:43.286 --> 00:45.322
They don't just take a show
off one network

00:45.355 --> 00:48.291
-and put it
on a different network.
-(laughs)

00:48.325 --> 00:49.959
Hey, there it is.

00:49.992 --> 00:52.395
-You were right, Mr. B.
-Oh.

00:52.429 --> 00:54.431
*

01:00.837 --> 01:02.772
Am I wrong or is it,
like, way better

01:02.805 --> 01:04.841
-on this network?
-(chuckles)

01:04.874 --> 01:07.844
Way better. Way better.
I'll be damned.

01:07.877 --> 01:09.312
I've never heard
of this happening before.

01:09.346 --> 01:10.947
MIKE:
Well, it's pretty rare.

01:10.980 --> 01:15.151
Show must have a lot
of loyal, kick-ass fans, huh?

01:15.184 --> 01:17.620
Mandy, honey, where are you?
They're here.

01:17.654 --> 01:19.422
-(horn honks)
-Hey.

01:19.456 --> 01:20.957
Uh, just a heads-up.

01:20.990 --> 01:22.859
-Mandy's kind of mad
at me right now.
-Yeah?

01:22.892 --> 01:24.794
Well, she changed something
about herself,

01:24.827 --> 01:27.964
and I can't figure out what.

01:27.997 --> 01:29.499
Marriage is kind of
like karate, right?

01:29.532 --> 01:30.867
You're new at it.
You're, like, a white belt.

01:30.900 --> 01:32.268
Me, I'm a black belt.

01:32.301 --> 01:35.438
So welcome to my dojo, huh?

01:35.472 --> 01:37.440
Mom, Mom. This is really weird,

01:37.474 --> 01:40.377
but I got lost upstairs.

01:40.410 --> 01:42.178
Mandy.

01:42.211 --> 01:44.847
I like it.

01:47.216 --> 01:50.019
She looks exactly the same.

01:52.489 --> 01:54.524
-Oh, my baby's home.
-Hi.

01:54.557 --> 01:56.058
(laughs):
Oh!

01:56.092 --> 01:58.495
Oh, my dignified academy cadet.

01:58.528 --> 02:00.897
Oh, I missed my mommy.

02:00.930 --> 02:01.998
Hey, sis.

02:02.031 --> 02:04.534
Whoa, Mandy!

02:04.567 --> 02:08.070
I love it.

02:08.104 --> 02:10.407
You guys are so sweet.

02:10.440 --> 02:12.575
Oh, Dad.

02:12.609 --> 02:14.577
Dad, Dad, Dad.
You haven't changed a bit.

02:14.611 --> 02:15.978
Well, that's the good thing
about me.

02:16.012 --> 02:17.380
No matter how long
you haven't seen me,

02:17.414 --> 02:20.182
I'm still the same old guy.

02:22.184 --> 02:24.186
*

02:29.025 --> 02:31.227
-Uh-oh, military's here.
-Oh.

02:31.260 --> 02:32.762
But don't worry, Chuck,
she's on our side.

02:32.795 --> 02:34.096
(laughs) Eve!

02:34.130 --> 02:36.499
Or should I say... cadet.

02:36.533 --> 02:38.868
-At ease, jarhead.
-(laughs)

02:38.901 --> 02:41.571
-There she is. There she is.
-Ed.

02:41.604 --> 02:43.406
The best thing that'll happen
to the Air Force.

02:43.440 --> 02:44.707
Well, next to those things
that keep the geese

02:44.741 --> 02:45.942
out of the engines.

02:45.975 --> 02:48.377
Good to see you back, kiddo.

02:48.411 --> 02:50.447
Now you'll be able
to relax a bit, huh?

02:50.480 --> 02:52.882
Oh, she's a cadet
at the Air Force Academy.

02:52.915 --> 02:54.551
She's not gonna relax,
right, Eve?

02:54.584 --> 02:56.953
Well, last night I slept
in my footie pajamas, so...

02:56.986 --> 02:59.188
Hey, Chuck,

02:59.221 --> 03:01.858
I need some help
with my computer. It's frozen.

03:01.891 --> 03:03.860
Uh, you could try
command-alt-delete.

03:03.893 --> 03:06.095
Or command-Chuck-do-it.

03:08.297 --> 03:09.632
Hey, Baxters.

03:09.666 --> 03:11.968
-Hey, Baxter.
-I wanted to get Boyd

03:12.001 --> 03:13.703
and finish his birdhouse.
Where is he?

03:13.736 --> 03:15.137
Uh, he's at home
with his father.

03:15.171 --> 03:17.073
-Mr. Sunshine.
-Ooh.

03:17.106 --> 03:18.608
I haven't seen Ryan in a while.

03:18.641 --> 03:20.643
How's he adapting
to the new and improved America?

03:20.677 --> 03:24.814
Watches TV all day,
and he screams into a pillow.

03:24.847 --> 03:26.983
You know, I get it.
People see me in uniform

03:27.016 --> 03:28.651
and assume I want to hear
their hot take

03:28.685 --> 03:30.286
on what America really needs.

03:30.319 --> 03:33.923
Spoiler alert: I do not.

03:33.956 --> 03:35.892
Hey, I told you I'd spring
for that fancy dinner later

03:35.925 --> 03:38.294
at Outdoor Man Grill.
Be hungry.

03:38.327 --> 03:39.996
I was born hungry.

03:40.029 --> 03:43.566
Well, I've eaten since then,
but I'll be hungry again.

03:43.600 --> 03:45.434
-Want to join us?
-MIKE: Uh, no.

03:45.468 --> 03:47.103
I'm gonna grab Boyd
and bring him back here.

03:47.136 --> 03:48.805
And since Ryan'll be there,
I'll stop by

03:48.838 --> 03:51.107
and pick up
a nice bottle of gloat.

03:55.478 --> 03:56.646
Yo.

03:56.679 --> 03:57.747
-Hey.
-Hey, Boyd.

03:57.780 --> 03:58.815
You ready to go?

03:58.848 --> 04:00.983
Uh, Dad's still
making me dinner.

04:01.017 --> 04:03.119
Did the part come in
for the dirt bike?

04:03.152 --> 04:04.453
(chuckles):
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

04:04.487 --> 04:07.590
I think you mean "birdhouse."

04:07.624 --> 04:11.961
And yes, the part
for the 65cc birdhouse came in.

04:12.962 --> 04:14.797
-Hey, Ryan.
-Hey. (sighs)

04:14.831 --> 04:17.366
Uh, Boyd, dinner's
in the kitchen. Fried chicken.

04:17.399 --> 04:19.368
You fried a chicken?

04:19.401 --> 04:21.337
Yeah.

04:21.370 --> 04:22.772
I get to eat an animal,

04:22.805 --> 04:25.942
-and it's not even Christmas.
-Wow.

04:25.975 --> 04:27.610
I don't get it.

04:27.644 --> 04:30.212
Why eat healthy?
Whole country's going to hell.

04:30.246 --> 04:32.148
Oh, God, you are in deep.

04:32.181 --> 04:33.482
What happened
to that whole thing about,

04:33.516 --> 04:35.785
"chickens are people, too"?

04:35.818 --> 04:38.521
Don't start with me right now,
okay? I'm not in the mood.

04:38.555 --> 04:40.890
You don't have to be
in the mood. Just listen.

04:40.923 --> 04:44.060
Or we can watch TV.

04:44.093 --> 04:45.361
I mean, how can you not watch TV

04:45.394 --> 04:46.729
when the whole world
is going nuts?

04:46.763 --> 04:48.831
See? Look,
another breaking news alert.

04:48.865 --> 04:52.569
It's almost like
they're deliberately forcing us

04:52.602 --> 04:55.538
to stay glued to our TVs.

04:55.572 --> 04:57.073
I mean,

04:57.106 --> 04:59.842
how is it that one person
can create such a mess?

04:59.876 --> 05:04.413
Well, a lot of people didn't
like the last eight years.

05:04.446 --> 05:07.516
Okay, but at least
your bad guy was a good guy.

05:07.550 --> 05:11.353
And more importantly,
he was attractive.

05:11.387 --> 05:14.857
It's always the pretty people
that cause the trouble.

05:14.891 --> 05:16.726
Are you enjoying
making fun of me?

05:16.759 --> 05:18.394
Yes, I am, as a matter of fact.

05:18.427 --> 05:22.031
Come on, listen. Politicians,
politics always change.

05:22.064 --> 05:23.332
Sometimes it's my guys.

05:23.365 --> 05:26.435
-Sometimes it's your morons.
-Okay.

05:26.468 --> 05:28.370
But it is way worse now,
and this is the world

05:28.404 --> 05:30.239
that my son
is gonna have to grow up in.

05:30.272 --> 05:32.241
Not if you keep giving him
fried chicken.

05:32.274 --> 05:34.711
-Please don't block
the TV, Mike.
-Just...

05:34.744 --> 05:36.112
Come on, come on, come on.

05:36.145 --> 05:37.680
I have daughter and a grandson
that need you

05:37.714 --> 05:39.415
to think less about this
and more about them.

05:39.448 --> 05:40.783
-I think about them
all the time.
-No, you don't.

05:40.817 --> 05:42.351
-All you do is sit in...
-Yes, I do, which is what

05:42.384 --> 05:44.553
drives me crazy, because there's
nothing I can do about it.

05:44.587 --> 05:46.055
'Cause you can't change
the world.

05:46.088 --> 05:47.590
But there are certain
small things you can do

05:47.624 --> 05:49.558
to control your own life,
like this. Give me this.

05:49.592 --> 05:52.094
Watch this. Look, watch. Oh!

05:55.097 --> 05:57.934
This is weird.
I can still hear it in my head.

05:57.967 --> 06:00.703
Give yourself a break.
Go somewhere.

06:00.737 --> 06:02.939
There's a march on Saturday.

06:02.972 --> 06:05.608
How about something relaxing?

06:05.642 --> 06:07.309
Protest yoga.

06:07.343 --> 06:11.047
I wasn't aware they had
such a thing, but that's...

06:11.080 --> 06:13.482
Th-That sounds great.

06:15.852 --> 06:17.820
-Hey, honey.
-Hey, baby.

06:17.854 --> 06:19.722
I made your favorite breakfast.

06:19.756 --> 06:22.358
Ooh, spinach frittata
and roasted tomatoes?

06:24.426 --> 06:28.631
No, I think actually
I made my favorite breakfast.

06:28.665 --> 06:30.900
-A pan of ham, man.
-(Vanessa laughs)

06:30.933 --> 06:32.935
Well, hide that.

06:32.969 --> 06:35.638
Ryan just pulled up, and I don't
want him to get scared away.

06:35.672 --> 06:37.674
You know,
we hardly see him anymore.

06:37.707 --> 06:39.175
-You know, I actually think
I fixed that.
-Yeah?

06:39.208 --> 06:40.442
I went over there and gave him

06:40.476 --> 06:42.444
a Mike Baxter
inspirational speech.

06:42.478 --> 06:43.780
I think we're all good.

06:43.813 --> 06:47.283
I'm kind of like Gandhi
but better 'cause I bring ham.

06:48.484 --> 06:50.319
-Knock, knock.
-Hey.

06:50.352 --> 06:52.621
Hey. I come bearing
homemade gifts.

06:52.655 --> 06:54.423
Those are the best kind. Hi.

06:54.456 --> 06:56.358
Which is why you can never
find a parking place

06:56.392 --> 06:59.528
at House of Felt.

06:59.561 --> 07:02.431
As a thank-you, Mike,
for talking me out of my funk,

07:02.464 --> 07:06.168
I brought some fresh jars
of my homemade elderberry jam.

07:07.203 --> 07:08.671
Hey.

07:08.705 --> 07:12.441
Not necessary. Or wanted.

07:12.474 --> 07:14.711
Oh, Mike. But he's berry glad

07:14.744 --> 07:17.446
for help from his elder.

07:17.479 --> 07:19.716
Making it worse, honey.

07:19.749 --> 07:20.983
Oh.

07:21.017 --> 07:22.184
How are you doing?

07:22.218 --> 07:23.552
Uh, I'm good.

07:23.585 --> 07:25.822
Actually, you made me realize

07:25.855 --> 07:28.657
that it's time to get serious
and to stop being a victim

07:28.691 --> 07:31.060
and take some control
of my life.

07:31.093 --> 07:32.995
Just needed a little push.

07:34.063 --> 07:36.866
So I'm moving the family
to Canada.

07:38.667 --> 07:40.402
You're moving to Canada?

07:40.436 --> 07:42.338
Look, I know
it's kind of sudden,

07:42.371 --> 07:44.173
but please try not to overreact.

07:44.206 --> 07:47.343
You're ripping my grandbaby
from my arms.

07:48.344 --> 07:50.579
So there's a "no."

07:50.612 --> 07:52.882
I'm a "no."
What does Kris think?

07:52.915 --> 07:54.650
She's mulling it over.

07:54.683 --> 07:56.385
Kind of loudly.

07:58.120 --> 07:59.521
So there's three "no's."
And I'm sure

07:59.555 --> 08:02.158
Canada's not all that happy
about it.

08:02.191 --> 08:04.060
Look, I know that it's big news,

08:04.093 --> 08:06.963
-but I'm not actually asking
for your permission.
-MIKE: Wha...?

08:09.899 --> 08:12.001
But... what are we
gonna do, Mike?

08:12.034 --> 08:13.870
Not gonna do anything about it.

08:13.903 --> 08:16.338
(scoffs) A lot of people
say they're moving to Canada.

08:16.372 --> 08:18.975
They never move.

08:22.044 --> 08:25.047
He's Canadian!

08:28.818 --> 08:31.320
MANDY:
Ryan can't take Boyd to Canada.

08:32.755 --> 08:35.391
They'll be separated
at the border.

08:35.424 --> 08:37.559
Mandy, Dad and I
need to talk, so...

08:37.593 --> 08:39.728
Well, you should do it now.

08:39.762 --> 08:42.398
You're together.

08:44.400 --> 08:45.802
Get out.

08:45.835 --> 08:48.104
Okay.

08:48.137 --> 08:49.806
What's going on in there?

08:49.839 --> 08:52.074
It is a private discussion.

08:52.108 --> 08:54.076
And?

08:54.110 --> 08:56.779
Ryan wants to move the family
to Canada.

08:58.014 --> 09:00.049
-Oh, Canada the country?
-(Eve sighs)

09:00.082 --> 09:03.485
Wow, typical Ryan.
Loses the election

09:03.519 --> 09:05.221
and whines his way
all the way back

09:05.254 --> 09:08.057
to his poutine-loving
safe space.

09:08.090 --> 09:09.558
Actually,
lots of people aren't happy

09:09.591 --> 09:11.928
with this administration's
social policies.

09:11.961 --> 09:15.064
Whoa. Since when
did you get all woke?

09:15.097 --> 09:17.299
Until last year you thought
the Presidential Seal

09:17.333 --> 09:19.135
was an actual seal.

09:19.168 --> 09:22.004
Hey, I didn't ask
to be socially aware.

09:22.038 --> 09:25.341
The news has seeped into
all my social media platforms--

09:25.374 --> 09:28.677
Twitter, Instagram,
Peepers, Flom-Flom...

09:28.710 --> 09:31.814
All right, look, I swore an oath
to defend this nation,

09:31.848 --> 09:35.084
and if Ryan is so unhappy here,
I say good riddance.

09:35.117 --> 09:36.986
-Eve has a point.
-Just because someone's unhappy

09:37.019 --> 09:39.355
with how things are doesn't mean
they're not patriotic.

09:39.388 --> 09:42.358
Our forefathers--
or maybe there were five--

09:42.391 --> 09:45.194
anyway, they all wanted us
to express our opinions.

09:45.227 --> 09:47.029
-That's true.
-And I'll express my opinion.

09:47.063 --> 09:48.497
The election's over, my friend.

09:48.530 --> 09:51.968
Which election, the popular vote
or the electric college?

09:52.001 --> 09:54.003
-Wow.
-You know, they say

09:54.036 --> 09:55.637
-there's two sides
to every argument.
-MANDY: Yeah.

09:55.671 --> 09:57.706
But you're my husband, so you're
on my side, right, babe?

09:57.739 --> 09:59.508
-Actually, I...
-Oh! Ha!

09:59.541 --> 10:01.510
-He agrees with me.
-No, he agrees with me.

10:01.543 --> 10:03.779
-No, with me.
-Can't I just be in the middle?

10:03.812 --> 10:05.681
-There is no middle anymore!
-There's no middle anymore,
Kyle!

10:05.714 --> 10:07.783
Guys, guys, you got to stop
arguing about this stuff.

10:07.816 --> 10:09.618
Y-You're so loud
we can't even argue.

10:09.651 --> 10:11.120
She's being a right-wing idiot.

10:11.153 --> 10:13.322
Well, she's being
a left-wing idiot.

10:13.355 --> 10:15.791
That's actually redundant.
(laughs)

10:15.824 --> 10:17.126
Electric college?

10:17.159 --> 10:18.895
-Are you actually dumb?
-I'm sorry, do you know...

10:18.928 --> 10:20.029
-Did you hear what I said?
-(overlapping arguing)

10:20.062 --> 10:22.664
-Girls. Girls!
-(whistle blows)

10:22.698 --> 10:25.301
That's it.
For the rest of Eve's visit,

10:25.334 --> 10:27.236
there will be no more
political discussion.

10:27.269 --> 10:31.473
Perfect. Until you leave, Eve,
nobody talks politics but me.

10:31.507 --> 10:33.142
(whistle blows)

10:33.175 --> 10:34.543
Not you, either.

10:34.576 --> 10:36.245
-What happened to free speech?
-Uh-uh.

10:36.278 --> 10:39.115
When did we turn into
UC Berkeley?

10:41.117 --> 10:42.751
CHUCK:
What a great kid.

10:42.784 --> 10:44.486
Yeah. Hey, hi, Mikey.

10:44.520 --> 10:45.922
We're just talking about Eve.

10:45.955 --> 10:47.156
You and Vanessa should be proud

10:47.189 --> 10:49.725
-of all your kids.
-That's right.

10:49.758 --> 10:52.494
They're all a pain in the ass.

10:52.528 --> 10:54.830
It's gonna be a long day.

10:54.863 --> 10:56.232
They're all
at each other's throats

10:56.265 --> 10:59.068
because of all this
political stuff.

10:59.101 --> 11:00.903
Gee, they sound like...

11:00.937 --> 11:03.839
every other person in America.

11:03.872 --> 11:07.643
I blame highly caffeinated
sports drinks.

11:09.645 --> 11:11.613
Now, you know, my wife says

11:11.647 --> 11:13.615
-no more political talk
around the house, you know?
-Mm.

11:13.649 --> 11:15.384
So all we talk about is...

11:15.417 --> 11:17.586
I don't know. What do
boring families talk about?

11:17.619 --> 11:20.589
I don't know.
I live alone.

11:20.622 --> 11:23.192
Alexa and I play Jeopardy!

11:23.225 --> 11:24.593
Sadly,

11:24.626 --> 11:27.063
you're not the only family
going through this, amigo.

11:27.096 --> 11:28.965
Since the election,
when my brother calls,

11:28.998 --> 11:30.967
I don't even answer the phone.

11:31.000 --> 11:33.102
I know he's trolling
for an argument.

11:33.135 --> 11:34.703
Wait a minute,

11:34.736 --> 11:37.506
you haven't been taking
my calls lately.

11:38.574 --> 11:39.908
Okay.

11:39.942 --> 11:41.910
This is not what America's
supposed to be.

11:41.944 --> 11:43.745
-Mm.
-I miss the good old days,

11:43.779 --> 11:45.914
when we were all
on the same page.

11:45.948 --> 11:50.319
Yeah, like...
during the Vietnam War.

11:50.352 --> 11:52.488
That's a good point. All right,
and it was a little tense

11:52.521 --> 11:54.790
-during the McCarthy hearings
in the '50s, too.
-Mm.

11:54.823 --> 11:56.792
Gee, sounds like you fellas
had it rough.

11:56.825 --> 11:59.228
Fortunately, for me,
civil rights movement?

11:59.261 --> 12:01.330
Cake walk.

12:01.363 --> 12:03.332
Maybe there's something
in the Americans' DNA

12:03.365 --> 12:05.001
-that causes conflict.
-I don't think

12:05.034 --> 12:06.335
there's anything wrong
with conflict.

12:06.368 --> 12:08.570
I just don't think we should be
turning on each other.

12:08.604 --> 12:12.274
I mean, we're better
than that, right?

12:12.308 --> 12:16.645
So, I'm liking
the Broncos' defense this year.

12:20.282 --> 12:21.317
Look at this.

12:21.350 --> 12:23.752
Wonderful to see
my two beautiful daughters

12:23.785 --> 12:25.854
spending time with each other.

12:27.189 --> 12:28.257
Oh.

12:28.290 --> 12:29.491
I didn't know she was here.

12:29.525 --> 12:30.859
I'll leave.

12:30.892 --> 12:32.794
Great. I can change
the welcome banner

12:32.828 --> 12:34.830
to "Good-bye."

12:34.863 --> 12:37.166
And I look forward
to seeing how you spell it.

12:38.834 --> 12:42.538
You know, they say
kids just grow up way too fast.

12:42.571 --> 12:45.574
Well, I am still waiting
for that.

12:46.742 --> 12:49.978
Oh, hey, Mr. B.
Welcome home.

12:50.012 --> 12:52.681
(whispers):
Leave.

12:52.714 --> 12:55.117
I think I'm gonna clean
the living room floor now,

12:55.151 --> 12:57.119
so, uh, go to separate rooms.

12:57.153 --> 12:58.620
No, no, no, no.
Everybody stay right here.

12:58.654 --> 13:00.456
Kyle, come back in here.
Come on, come on.

13:00.489 --> 13:02.291
Sit down. Everybody.
You know why?

13:02.324 --> 13:03.959
'Cause we're a family
and we're gonna have

13:03.992 --> 13:06.328
a nonpolitical conversation.
Okay?

13:06.362 --> 13:09.565
Who wants to start?
Who wants to go? Come on.

13:12.568 --> 13:14.370
I'll go.

13:14.403 --> 13:15.904
Great day for me.

13:15.937 --> 13:17.739
Saw a dead beaver.

13:17.773 --> 13:22.578
Right off the exit,
you know, 19.

13:22.611 --> 13:24.546
(sighs)

13:24.580 --> 13:26.548
Okay.

13:26.582 --> 13:28.417
You go.

13:28.450 --> 13:29.851
Thank you. Okay.

13:29.885 --> 13:33.355
Uh, yeah, well,
let's see, um, hmm...

13:33.389 --> 13:35.757
the last time
you tried to fix something,

13:35.791 --> 13:38.860
uh, half the family said
they were moving to Canada.

13:39.895 --> 13:41.029
Thanks for the help.

13:42.598 --> 13:45.767
Eve, say something nice
to your sister, please.

13:45.801 --> 13:47.936
(sighs)
Fine.

13:48.970 --> 13:50.539
Mandy,

13:50.572 --> 13:53.542
I like that you're an idiot,

13:53.575 --> 13:56.612
because you're easy
to win arguments with.

13:56.645 --> 13:58.280
Oh, yeah?

13:58.314 --> 14:01.550
I'm smart enough to not end
a sentence with "with."

14:02.951 --> 14:05.221
(quietly):
Damn it.

14:05.254 --> 14:06.922
Come on, come on, girls.

14:06.955 --> 14:09.758
Are you no longer even capable
of being polite to each other?

14:09.791 --> 14:11.127
-Nope.
-Ditto.

14:11.160 --> 14:13.795
No ditto. No ditto.
You're the ditto.

14:13.829 --> 14:15.297
Have you guys seen Boyd?

14:15.331 --> 14:17.099
-Mom, is Boyd here?
-What?

14:17.133 --> 14:18.134
No, why?

14:18.167 --> 14:19.701
He was supposed to be home
two hours ago.

14:19.735 --> 14:21.370
Oh, boy.
Just relax a second.

14:21.403 --> 14:23.572
(stammers)
Who talked to him last?

14:23.605 --> 14:24.973
We called all of his friends.
Nobody's seen him.

14:25.006 --> 14:26.408
We don't know what to do.

14:26.442 --> 14:28.610
-MIKE: Um, let's...
-Mandy, let's check the park.

14:28.644 --> 14:29.645
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-Good idea. I'll get my keys.

14:29.678 --> 14:30.646
Uh, uh, Kyle and I,

14:30.679 --> 14:32.148
we'll-we'll check the arcade.

14:32.181 --> 14:33.549
-Yeah, he likes the one
on Leetsdale.
-Okay.

14:33.582 --> 14:34.816
I should be home,
in case he shows?

14:34.850 --> 14:36.552
Yeah, and, uh, I'll check
the comic book store.

14:36.585 --> 14:38.287
All right, I'm gonna stay here
in case he comes here.

14:38.320 --> 14:40.922
And call me if you find him!

14:42.591 --> 14:45.127
Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on.

14:45.161 --> 14:46.762
Hey. Larabee, it's me.

14:46.795 --> 14:49.731
Yeah. Do me a favor and,
uh, check the security cams.

14:49.765 --> 14:51.633
Um, go to the loading dock.

14:52.601 --> 14:54.670
CHUCK:
Ah. Huh. Looks like Boyd

14:54.703 --> 14:57.773
-is working on your birdhouse.
-Okay, perfect.

14:57.806 --> 14:59.808
Do me a little favor. Keep
an eye on him till I get there.

14:59.841 --> 15:01.677
I got to call my family.

15:07.683 --> 15:09.251
Hey.

15:09.285 --> 15:11.820
-Hey, Grandpa.
-Don't "Hey, Grandpa" me.

15:11.853 --> 15:13.422
Before I figured out
where you were,

15:13.455 --> 15:16.024
everybody was going crazy
looking for you.

15:16.057 --> 15:18.627
Guess I should've told 'em
where I was going.

15:18.660 --> 15:21.129
You might've thought about that
before you ran away.

15:21.163 --> 15:24.566
And, by the way,
next time you run away, don't.

15:26.067 --> 15:27.803
-Sorry.
-I haven't seen your dad

15:27.836 --> 15:32.374
this upset since Rachel Maddow
took a week off.

15:32.408 --> 15:36.845
I-I just wanted
a quiet place to think.

15:36.878 --> 15:39.014
I get it.

15:39.047 --> 15:41.483
We don't have to talk.

15:47.022 --> 15:49.825
I don't want to move to Canada.

15:49.858 --> 15:51.560
My flag football team

15:51.593 --> 15:55.731
is actually letting me play
this year.

15:55.764 --> 15:56.998
Have you told your folks this?

15:57.032 --> 15:59.501
You can tell your parents
anything, kid.

15:59.535 --> 16:02.003
Except about this.

16:02.037 --> 16:04.740
If they ask you,
you were hiding in my office.

16:04.773 --> 16:06.575
I just hate fighting.

16:06.608 --> 16:10.412
E-Everybody's fighting
about everything.

16:10.446 --> 16:11.847
Even at school.

16:11.880 --> 16:14.182
It's like everything's broken.

16:14.216 --> 16:16.518
We saw this at a garage sale.

16:16.552 --> 16:18.186
Remember what everybody said?

16:18.220 --> 16:21.022
"Why do you want that?
It's broken."

16:21.056 --> 16:23.759
But you said it had a lot
of parts that still work.

16:23.792 --> 16:25.093
That's what I told you.

16:25.126 --> 16:26.762
I told the owner,
"It's a piece of junk.

16:26.795 --> 16:28.464
I'll give you ten bucks for it."

16:30.466 --> 16:34.436
Look, we saw something
worth saving.

16:34.470 --> 16:39.675
And we were both willing to do
the work together to fix it.

16:39.708 --> 16:44.446
If you have that, you can put
anything back together again.

16:45.547 --> 16:47.383
-There. Finished.
-Yeah.

16:47.416 --> 16:52.153
You're gonna have the fastest
birdhouse in the parking lot.

16:54.590 --> 16:56.625
Wipe up your hands.

16:56.658 --> 16:58.660
We're gonna go fix
something else.

17:07.736 --> 17:09.438
Not cool, Boyd.
Okay, you hear me?

17:09.471 --> 17:11.273
That was really,
really not cool.

17:11.307 --> 17:14.410
So, so not cool.
Really, really, really not cool.

17:14.443 --> 17:17.979
Okay. You guys can yell at him--
or whatever this is-- later.

17:18.013 --> 17:20.115
I got to talk to everybody.

17:20.148 --> 17:21.383
I have a-- I really...

17:21.417 --> 17:22.884
Okay, he's not
in the crawlspace.

17:22.918 --> 17:24.286
-No, he's not.
-Wait,

17:24.320 --> 17:26.822
he's in the living room.

17:26.855 --> 17:29.391
Congratulations, Kyle,
you found him.

17:29.425 --> 17:31.827
Okay, great. I-I want
to just talk to the adults.

17:31.860 --> 17:33.161
Boyd, could you give us
a minute, please?

17:34.763 --> 17:36.965
Thank God the kid's back
and you can discipline him

17:36.998 --> 17:38.300
however you want--
that's your business--

17:38.334 --> 17:40.268
but I think we should be
thanking him a little bit.

17:40.302 --> 17:43.004
(chuckles) Really?
Can't wait to hear this one.

17:43.038 --> 17:44.840
'Cause he got in trouble-- thank
God there's nothing wrong--

17:44.873 --> 17:47.008
we started acting like a family
for a minute. This--

17:47.042 --> 17:49.010
-It was good stuff...
-Yeah, so true, Mr. B.

17:49.044 --> 17:51.046
You have a spider in your hair.

17:53.014 --> 17:55.183
Come on, guys.
We're gonna have differences.

17:55.216 --> 17:56.818
-(stammers) Um...
-Right. Right.

17:56.852 --> 17:58.987
-And we're gonna disagree,
yes, yes.
-Right, right.

17:59.020 --> 18:00.756
-But we can't let that
break us apart.
-Exactly.

18:00.789 --> 18:03.325
We have to always remember
that we love each other.

18:03.359 --> 18:06.762
And-and because of that,
we treat each other with dignity

18:06.795 --> 18:10.466
-and respect,
because that's who we are.
-Mm-hmm.

18:10.499 --> 18:13.034
(exhales)
I'm sorry about earlier.

18:13.068 --> 18:15.036
Ditto.

18:15.070 --> 18:17.172
MIKE:
Mm. Great. Good.

18:17.205 --> 18:18.840
I'm sorry we started
this whole thing

18:18.874 --> 18:21.209
with talk of us moving
to Canada.

18:21.242 --> 18:23.845
I just don't feel
like I have a choice.

18:23.879 --> 18:26.114
Look, I know
that you're not happy about it,

18:26.147 --> 18:29.451
but I need to take some action
or I'm gonna lose my mind.

18:29.485 --> 18:32.153
What about everything
my mom and dad just said?

18:32.187 --> 18:34.790
Yeah, it was
a really nice little speech.

18:34.823 --> 18:37.058
But, I mean, come on, do
you honestly respect my opinion?

18:37.092 --> 18:38.494
Not even a little.

18:38.527 --> 18:41.029
But I do respect
your right to have one.

18:41.062 --> 18:42.464
So, here.

18:42.498 --> 18:44.165
-What's this?
-Read it.

18:44.199 --> 18:46.234
You said you want
to do something, do something.

18:46.267 --> 18:48.570
"Application
for U.S. Citizenship"?

18:48.604 --> 18:50.572
We have to fill out a form?

18:50.606 --> 18:51.907
I never did that!

18:51.940 --> 18:53.542
Mandy!

18:53.575 --> 18:55.844
Shh, shh.

18:55.877 --> 18:58.246
Are you sure you want me
to become a U.S. citizen?

18:58.279 --> 18:59.915
-I don't know.
-You realize that this is

18:59.948 --> 19:01.917
-my vote canceling out yours.
-Oh, no.

19:01.950 --> 19:05.153
It's gonna be fine. There's
a lot more me's out there.

19:05.186 --> 19:07.689
You used to talk
about doing this.

19:07.723 --> 19:11.660
Yeah, but it's a long process
and there's no guarantee.

19:11.693 --> 19:13.261
Uh, I guarantee
that I will kill you

19:13.294 --> 19:14.763
if you take away my grandbaby.

19:14.796 --> 19:16.197
There you go.

19:16.231 --> 19:17.599
All right, fine.

19:17.633 --> 19:19.435
-I will think about it.
-MIKE: Great.

19:19.468 --> 19:21.870
-Thank you, honey.
-Hey, Boyd. Come on in.

19:21.903 --> 19:24.673
-Hey, we're done, we're done.
We're good.
-Come here.

19:24.706 --> 19:26.174
-Great job, sweetie.
-Thanks.

19:26.207 --> 19:27.909
-Listen, this worked out
pretty well.
-Mm.

19:27.943 --> 19:29.678
I got an idea. I think
we should have a lot more

19:29.711 --> 19:32.548
-family tragedies, because...
-No! No...

19:32.581 --> 19:34.750
I've got it.

19:34.783 --> 19:36.351
You're taller and blonde!

19:36.384 --> 19:38.053
Yes!
(chuckles)

19:39.721 --> 19:42.223
I'll be damned.

19:49.230 --> 19:50.932
Hey, Mike Baxter here
for Outdoor Man,

19:50.966 --> 19:53.935
here to talk about,
well, talking.

19:53.969 --> 19:56.872
(chuckles) It's one
of my favorite hobbies.

19:56.905 --> 19:59.074
A wise man once said,

19:59.107 --> 20:00.809
"If you don't have
anything nice to say,

20:00.842 --> 20:02.811
don't say anything at all."

20:02.844 --> 20:05.981
And then it was said an even
wiser man said to that guy,

20:06.014 --> 20:09.184
"Look, jackass, listen up.
You might learn something."

20:10.652 --> 20:12.287
All right, you got me.

20:12.320 --> 20:15.290
I'm the second wise man
in that story.

20:15.323 --> 20:17.225
Let's be honest,
if nobody's talking,

20:17.258 --> 20:18.627
then nobody's listening.

20:18.660 --> 20:20.896
If nobody's listening,
nobody's learning.

20:20.929 --> 20:22.297
And if nobody's learning,

20:22.330 --> 20:25.534
then good TV shows
get canceled.

20:30.005 --> 20:32.173
They will.

20:32.207 --> 20:35.443
But even in our country
and even within our families,

20:35.477 --> 20:38.346
not communicating seems to be
the weapon of choice right now.

20:38.379 --> 20:41.517
We un-friend, un-like,
and un-follow

20:41.550 --> 20:43.952
instead of trying
to understand each other.

20:43.985 --> 20:46.021
Now, it doesn't matter
which side you're on...

20:46.054 --> 20:49.124
(chuckling): although one side
literally has the word "right"

20:49.157 --> 20:50.125
right in it.

20:50.158 --> 20:52.561
(muttering, chuckling)

20:53.995 --> 20:55.531
(sighs)

20:55.564 --> 20:57.766
If we just hunker down
in our separate corners,

20:57.799 --> 20:59.367
nobody wins.

20:59.400 --> 21:03.404
(whispers): Except Location
Services on your phone.

21:05.140 --> 21:07.442
In America,
we've always been able

21:07.475 --> 21:09.177
to have tough conversations.

21:09.210 --> 21:10.846
Civil rights, Vietnam,

21:10.879 --> 21:14.282
the human hot potato
Kanye West.

21:14.315 --> 21:17.185
He's yours. Uh, no, yours.
You can have him.

21:17.218 --> 21:19.020
No, he's not ours. He's, like,
yours. You can have him.

21:19.054 --> 21:22.357
No, we don't--
Literally, we don't want him.

21:22.390 --> 21:25.293
So to the families of America
and to the American family,

21:25.326 --> 21:26.461
keep talking.

21:26.494 --> 21:27.863
Unless you know a smarter guy

21:27.896 --> 21:29.531
with better ideas is talking,

21:29.565 --> 21:32.200
then you could just listen
to him.

21:33.935 --> 21:36.104
Baxter out.

21:38.607 --> 21:40.075
(clucking)

21:40.108 --> 21:42.077
