Boys, cookies!

00:03.960 --> 00:06.180
-All right!
-Nuh-uh, not that one.

00:06.267 --> 00:07.964
I put Dewey's antibiotics
in that one.

00:08.051 --> 00:11.054
Take this one.
It's biggest.

00:11.141 --> 00:12.708
Did you put anything
in this one?

00:12.795 --> 00:15.145
Of course not.
Just take it.

00:15.232 --> 00:18.192
Then take this one
20 minutes later.

There's no doubt about it, we're
totally gonna go this year.

00:56.273 --> 00:57.666
Totally.
It's not even a question.

00:57.753 --> 00:59.363
What's there
to question?

00:59.450 --> 01:00.495
-Nothing. Because we're going.
-We're totally going.

01:00.582 --> 01:01.626
Totally.

01:01.713 --> 01:03.237
Oh, God, Burning Man again?

01:03.324 --> 01:04.281
Every year

01:04.367 --> 01:05.891
it's the same thing--

01:05.978 --> 01:07.763
"This time we're totally going!"

01:07.850 --> 01:09.547
"Oh, yeah, totally!"

01:09.634 --> 01:12.202
And every year you chicken out
with some pathetic excuse.

01:12.289 --> 01:15.901
My personal favorite was
last year's "really bad
Slurpee headache."

01:15.988 --> 01:18.165
See? That is exactly
the kind of ignorant talk

01:18.252 --> 01:20.036
I'd expect from someone
who doesn't have

01:20.123 --> 01:21.994
any appreciation for
what Burning Man is--

01:22.082 --> 01:23.866
a week of freedom
out in the desert,

01:23.953 --> 01:26.521
naked women, getting back
to your primal nature,

01:26.608 --> 01:27.957
naked women,

01:28.044 --> 01:30.394
people doing art,
naked women.

01:30.481 --> 01:32.179
-Are all the women naked?
-Oof!

01:32.266 --> 01:34.050
That is all you
heard, isn't it?

01:35.269 --> 01:36.618
Mom...

01:37.662 --> 01:40.317
Dad breakfast... Jamie...

01:40.404 --> 01:42.014
Dewey...

01:44.974 --> 01:47.977
Dad dinner.
[ whispers ]

01:48.064 --> 01:50.371
There. That should get us
till tomorrow.

01:50.458 --> 01:51.937
I can't believe it.

01:52.024 --> 01:53.330
We're really doing it!

01:53.417 --> 01:54.549
We're actually going
to Burning Man!

01:54.636 --> 01:55.941
Hitchhiking?!

01:56.028 --> 01:59.075
Hitchhiking on the highway
like hobos?!

01:59.162 --> 02:00.511
Thank God your mother

02:00.598 --> 02:02.426
undercooked the chicken
last night, or who knows

02:02.513 --> 02:04.124
when we might have
found out about this?!

02:04.211 --> 02:06.082
What were you thinking?!

02:06.169 --> 02:07.823
Sneaking off in
the middle of the night

02:07.910 --> 02:09.868
to go to some overblown
keg party in the desert!

02:09.955 --> 02:12.132
That is not what
Burning Man is all about.

02:12.219 --> 02:14.308
Burning Man is an
incredible, interactive

02:14.395 --> 02:16.832
experiment in human creativity,
where you do art

02:16.919 --> 02:18.703
just for art's sake,
and you make music

02:18.790 --> 02:20.879
from instruments that
came to you in dreams.

02:20.966 --> 02:23.404
It's the one place where you're
free to let go and really see

02:23.491 --> 02:24.709
what you're capable
of creating

02:24.796 --> 02:26.407
without worrying
what anyone else thinks!

02:26.494 --> 02:28.452
That's what Burning Man
is all about!

02:32.108 --> 02:34.458
I think she actually
might've bought that.

02:34.545 --> 02:37.548
This Burning Person sounds like
it's gonna be a lot of fun.

02:37.635 --> 02:39.333
What a great idea, Malcolm.

02:39.420 --> 02:42.118
Yeah. Maybe next year we can
take Grandma to Mardi Gras.

02:42.205 --> 02:44.381
You think I enjoy having powers
that I can't control?

02:44.468 --> 02:47.254
Believe me, I'd much rather be
as stupid as you are.

02:47.341 --> 02:49.038
Don't try sucking
up to me now.

02:49.125 --> 02:52.346
I still can't believe Mr. Barnes
let you borrow his fancy RV.

02:52.433 --> 02:53.782
This is so classy.

02:53.869 --> 02:56.567
This is like
Buckingham Palace on wheels.

02:56.654 --> 02:58.656
He ripped one on the elevator
just before the CEO got on,

02:58.743 --> 03:00.310
and I took the blame for it.

03:00.397 --> 03:02.269
That's the way things work
in the corporate world.

03:02.356 --> 03:03.966
You're unselfish,
and it paid off.

03:04.053 --> 03:05.402
Hey, you boys check out

03:05.489 --> 03:07.143
the flat-screen TV
back in the bedroom?

03:07.230 --> 03:09.319
And the two-thirds-
scale fold-down
pool table?

03:09.406 --> 03:12.148
Boy, we're gonna have
so much fun in this baby!

03:12.235 --> 03:14.629
-[bottle cap pops]
-Whoa, whoa. What was that?

03:14.716 --> 03:16.761
I just opened an apple juice
for Jamie.

03:16.848 --> 03:18.763
And now you can
close it back up.

03:18.850 --> 03:20.591
I thought I was
clear about this.

03:20.678 --> 03:22.419
The camper is going back
without a single stain,

03:22.506 --> 03:24.204
smudge, smell or dent.

03:24.291 --> 03:25.814
Yeah, but I really think
Jamie...

03:25.901 --> 03:27.729
D-D-D-D-Dewey,
what is the rule?

03:27.816 --> 03:30.906
This one RV
is worth three of me.

03:30.993 --> 03:32.473
Okay.

03:34.344 --> 03:36.520
Help me get this grate off.

03:36.607 --> 03:38.348
I'm gonna ditch out
when we slow down for a turn.

03:38.435 --> 03:40.220
I am not going to Burning Man
with Mom and Dad.

03:40.307 --> 03:42.396
Reese, we're in the middle
of the desert.

03:42.483 --> 03:44.006
I know what you're thinking--

03:44.093 --> 03:46.269
the roadrunners are too smart
to catch and eat.

03:46.356 --> 03:48.010
But the coyotes are idiots.

03:48.097 --> 03:49.925
Look, it might not be
as embarrassing as we think.

03:50.012 --> 03:51.318
If we move quick,
we might be able

03:51.405 --> 03:52.841
to sneak off
without anyone knowing

03:52.928 --> 03:54.625
that we came to Burning Man
with our parents.

03:54.712 --> 03:58.847
-[horn blares tune]
-We're here!

03:58.934 --> 04:02.067
[horn continues blaring]

04:17.779 --> 04:20.434
LOIS:
Hey, neighbors!

04:20.521 --> 04:21.870
I'm gonna do art, too.

04:21.957 --> 04:24.133
I brought my paintbrushes.

04:24.220 --> 04:26.048
Okay, let's get moving here.

04:26.135 --> 04:28.703
Reese, Malcolm,
I want you guys...

04:28.790 --> 04:30.226
They're gone.

04:30.313 --> 04:33.055
They shimmied under the
RV and took off running.

04:33.142 --> 04:34.883
Oh. Well,
then I guess it's up to you

04:34.970 --> 04:37.625
to help me set up a protective
perimeter around the camper.

04:37.712 --> 04:39.496
We'll need about 40 rocks,
at least the size

04:39.583 --> 04:41.672
of bowling balls.

04:41.759 --> 04:43.935
I'm sorry, son.
You snooze, you lose.

04:44.022 --> 04:46.373
Now, come on, come on,
don't let the flies get in.

04:46.460 --> 04:49.332
Look at this place--
it's amazing!

04:49.419 --> 04:53.554
That has to be
the coolest guy on Earth!

04:53.641 --> 04:55.033
See? I told you everything
was gonna be all right--

04:55.120 --> 04:56.818
even with Mom and Dad here.

04:56.905 --> 04:58.559
We just need to make sure
we look out for each other...

04:58.646 --> 05:00.125
Whoa! Ow!

05:00.212 --> 05:01.736
Ow! Damn it!

05:01.823 --> 05:04.129
I stepped on a cactus.
Can you give me a hand?

05:04.216 --> 05:06.871
Reese?

05:12.268 --> 05:13.791
Hey, buddy?

05:13.878 --> 05:15.619
You know where the
topless chicks are?

05:15.706 --> 05:17.534
And I'm not interested
in the uggos or blimps,

05:17.621 --> 05:18.840
if you know
what I'm saying.

05:19.928 --> 05:22.365
Follow me,
I'm going that way.

05:22.452 --> 05:24.454
-Hey, man, want some Stanley?
-[whooping]

05:24.541 --> 05:25.760
[chuckling]

05:25.847 --> 05:27.718
-First time at Burning Man?
-Yeah.

05:27.805 --> 05:29.198
Yeah, I can always
tell the newbies.

05:29.285 --> 05:31.026
Hey, you guys,
you want a little Stanley?

05:31.113 --> 05:33.158
[all shout]

05:33.245 --> 05:34.334
What's Stanley?

05:34.421 --> 05:36.684
Oh, Stanley was
a buddy of mine.

05:36.771 --> 05:38.686
We've been coming
to Burning Man together

05:38.773 --> 05:39.774
almost 20 years.

05:39.861 --> 05:41.384
Stanley!

05:41.471 --> 05:43.604
[chuckles]
Anyway, he passed on

05:43.691 --> 05:45.170
over the winter,
and he always said

05:45.257 --> 05:46.955
he wanted his ashes
scattered here,

05:47.042 --> 05:49.349
kind of as a way of spreading
the spirit of Burning Man

05:49.436 --> 05:51.525
to the people
and the family he loved.

05:51.612 --> 05:53.004
[man whoops]

05:53.091 --> 05:54.876
And you're allowed
to do that?

05:54.963 --> 05:57.182
Spray a dead
guy on people?!

05:57.269 --> 05:58.967
I got suspended for a week

05:59.054 --> 06:01.448
for putting a mouse's head
on the end of my pencil.

06:01.535 --> 06:03.101
Burning Man's
all about freedom, dude.

06:03.188 --> 06:05.103
You can do
whatever you want here.

06:05.190 --> 06:07.410
Whatever I want?

06:08.585 --> 06:10.195
You mean, I could
kick this over?

06:10.282 --> 06:11.849
Or break that?

06:11.936 --> 06:15.113
Well, I guess if you
really felt you had to.

06:15.200 --> 06:18.769
Doesn't that kind of take the
fun out of mindless destruction?

06:18.856 --> 06:22.904
That's what
the flaming catapult's for.

06:22.991 --> 06:25.515
Yeah, but the real spirit

06:25.602 --> 06:27.082
of Burning Man isn't
about destruction.

06:27.169 --> 06:30.128
It's about creating,
participating, contributing.

06:30.215 --> 06:31.782
Building a community

06:31.869 --> 06:33.741
that needs you,
relies on you.

06:33.828 --> 06:37.005
It's about allowing yourself
to become part of the whole,

06:37.092 --> 06:40.008
and then coming away from it
with more than you brought.

06:40.095 --> 06:42.924
No, there's no feeling
like it in the world.

06:43.011 --> 06:44.578
-Wow.
-Yeah,

06:44.665 --> 06:47.276
it's a mind-altering
journey, son...

06:47.363 --> 06:49.757
if you're willing
to take it.

06:51.367 --> 06:54.979
You know what?
I think I want some Stanley.

06:57.112 --> 06:59.244
[chuckles]

06:59.331 --> 07:03.858
Wow! This stuff is gorgeous.

07:03.945 --> 07:06.121
We really have to get some
for the house.

07:07.252 --> 07:08.602
Howdy! [chuckles]

07:08.689 --> 07:10.778
Just getting the old homestead
set up.

07:10.865 --> 07:12.083
Best hamburgers
and dogs

07:12.170 --> 07:14.390
you've ever tasted
are on me

07:14.477 --> 07:16.871
when I get this baby
fired up, huh?

07:16.958 --> 07:18.394
What's he doing?

07:18.481 --> 07:20.135
It's performance art.

07:21.571 --> 07:23.399
He's skewering
the empty banality

07:23.486 --> 07:25.401
of the modern suburban dad.

07:25.488 --> 07:28.143
Honey, where'd I put
my good basting brush?

07:28.230 --> 07:30.406
Honey?

07:30.493 --> 07:32.930
Honey?

07:33.017 --> 07:34.845
This guy's good.

07:37.500 --> 07:40.895
No one told me there was
a looky-loo convention in town.

07:40.982 --> 07:43.158
Dad, do I have to circle
the whole thing?

07:43.245 --> 07:44.855
I can't find any more rocks.

07:44.942 --> 07:46.509
Son, look, we might
be in the desert,

07:46.596 --> 07:48.119
but we are still
civilized people,

07:48.206 --> 07:50.339
and civilized people put
up arbitrary boundaries

07:50.426 --> 07:52.733
that they will fight
to the death to protect.

07:52.820 --> 07:55.692
I'm pretty sure we passed
some nice-sized rocks when
we turned into the camp.

07:55.779 --> 07:57.433
That's half a mile away!

07:57.520 --> 07:59.696
Don't be silly.
Two miles, easy.

07:59.783 --> 08:01.481
LOIS:
Here we go!

08:01.568 --> 08:03.265
Whoop-dee-doo!

08:03.352 --> 08:05.093
Hal, this place is so great!

08:05.180 --> 08:08.226
I met the nicest group of gals
down by the Porta-Potty.

08:08.313 --> 08:09.924
They call themselves
a "tribe,"

08:10.011 --> 08:10.925
like a group
of wild Indians.

08:11.012 --> 08:12.361
Isn't that cute?

08:12.448 --> 08:14.972
They invited me to the
hemp-braiding tent later.

08:15.059 --> 08:17.061
What are you using
the Porta-Potties for

08:17.148 --> 08:18.323
when we have the world's

08:18.410 --> 08:20.325
greatest toilet ten feet
away in the RV?

08:20.412 --> 08:22.763
That thing will suck down
a small deer.

08:25.374 --> 08:27.115
[to himself]
Mention free food

08:27.202 --> 08:29.291
and they start
gathering like flies.

08:30.814 --> 08:34.164
This is great-- I'm gonna spend
my entire two days

08:34.251 --> 08:36.211
at Burning Man
standing in this line.

08:36.298 --> 08:37.559
Hey, man.

08:37.647 --> 08:38.822
You know,
the line's much shorter

08:38.909 --> 08:40.302
in front
of the Shaman's tent.

08:40.389 --> 08:41.303
The what?

08:41.390 --> 08:42.739
Oh, you will love her.

08:42.826 --> 08:44.306
She totally cured
my planter's warts.

08:44.393 --> 08:45.699
-Thanks, but...
-Come on, man.

08:45.786 --> 08:47.222
You think
I'd lead you wrong?

09:01.976 --> 09:03.891
And remember, if you're
gonna eat glass,

09:03.978 --> 09:08.199
chew at least ten times
before you swallow. Okay?

09:08.286 --> 09:10.593
Ooh, what do we have here?

09:10.680 --> 09:11.986
I stepped on a cactus.

09:12.073 --> 09:13.335
The needle went
right through my shoe.

09:13.422 --> 09:14.815
Let's take a look.

09:14.902 --> 09:16.207
It's not a big deal.

09:16.294 --> 09:18.035
I think I just need
some disinfectant

09:18.122 --> 09:19.254
and a Band-Aid
and I'll be...

09:19.341 --> 09:21.561
[gasps]
Ma'am?

09:21.648 --> 09:24.476
Mmm. You've internalized

09:24.564 --> 09:26.174
a lot of criticism,
haven't you?

09:26.261 --> 09:28.785
Well, I don't know.
I guess.

09:28.872 --> 09:30.221
But what does...
[gasps]

09:30.308 --> 09:31.658
[panting]

09:33.398 --> 09:36.184
Okay... here's your problem.

09:36.271 --> 09:39.317
You have an incredible amount
of passion in your soul,

09:39.404 --> 09:43.800
but you've got to let down the
armor you're using to shield it.

09:43.887 --> 09:46.194
[spits]
You also need a tetanus shot.

09:47.891 --> 09:49.676
Okay, she's almost
as old as my mom

09:49.763 --> 09:51.721
and obviously crazy
as a loon.

09:51.808 --> 09:53.897
So why am I so turned on?

09:55.725 --> 09:57.858
Most Western medicines
numb the body.

09:57.945 --> 09:59.468
They silence it.

09:59.555 --> 10:01.339
But the body's an
amazing thing, Malcolm--

10:01.426 --> 10:03.080
it can tell you
what's wrong with it.

10:03.167 --> 10:06.518
All real healing
is just listening.

10:06.606 --> 10:09.434
I don't see anything
alternative about that.

10:09.521 --> 10:11.480
I just don't see colonizing
space as the answer.

10:11.567 --> 10:13.438
I mean, if we can't
solve our problems here,

10:13.525 --> 10:15.440
what's the point of just
exporting them there?

10:15.527 --> 10:18.530
Even Werner Von Braun said that
everything science taught him

10:18.618 --> 10:20.620
strengthened his belief
in the continuity

10:20.707 --> 10:22.447
of spiritual existence
after death.

10:22.534 --> 10:25.973
Okay, I buy that Godzilla came
out of the collective purging

10:26.060 --> 10:27.844
of Japanese guilt
after World War II,

10:27.931 --> 10:30.064
but can you explain to me why
the costume had to look so fake?

10:30.151 --> 10:32.066
Well, let's see...

10:32.153 --> 10:34.024
first I'd say...

10:34.111 --> 10:35.635
the Go-Go's,

10:35.722 --> 10:37.375
then The Bangles...

10:37.462 --> 10:39.813
Bananarama
and Josie and the Pussycats.

10:39.900 --> 10:42.163
I can't believe it!
I hated  Charlotte's Web, too!

10:42.250 --> 10:44.469
I just wanted to squash
that whiny little spider.

10:44.556 --> 10:47.385
Deep dish.

10:47.472 --> 10:49.126
Chocolate chip.

10:49.213 --> 10:52.695
-Oscar the Grouch.
-Oscar the Grouch.

10:54.044 --> 10:56.133
Wow. And I thought
all that crap

10:56.220 --> 10:59.049
everyone said about love
was just to piss me off.

11:07.014 --> 11:08.319
So you're going to come?

11:08.406 --> 11:09.712
Oh, absolutely.

11:09.799 --> 11:11.018
That sounds like a hoot
and a half.

11:11.105 --> 11:12.933
Great. It's by
the giant foam tongue.

11:13.020 --> 11:14.717
Just make a left at the guy in
the phone booth full of Jell-O.

11:14.804 --> 11:16.850
If you hit the Men's Diaper
Brigade, you've gone too far.

11:16.937 --> 11:18.199
-See you there.
-Okay.

11:21.593 --> 11:23.117
What's this?

11:23.204 --> 11:24.596
The food's all green.

11:24.684 --> 11:25.772
I added a little food color.

11:25.859 --> 11:27.208
It's artistic.

11:27.295 --> 11:28.513
I'm being artistic.

11:28.600 --> 11:29.906
REESE:
Mom's right.

11:29.993 --> 11:31.299
I always thought art was
just stupid paintings

11:31.386 --> 11:32.430
of old dead guys in drag,

11:32.517 --> 11:34.215
but I was wrong.

11:34.302 --> 11:36.478
Art can be doing something,
or even undoing something.

11:36.565 --> 11:38.088
Like when I blew up
the Muller's mailbox--

11:38.175 --> 11:39.786
that was art, and
I didn't even know it.

11:39.873 --> 11:40.917
HAL:
Green eggs and toast.

11:41.004 --> 11:43.093
I do not like green eggs
and toast.

11:43.180 --> 11:44.965
Oh, for God's sake, Hal,
stretch a little.

11:45.052 --> 11:46.488
We're on vacation.

11:46.575 --> 11:47.663
Vacation?!

11:47.750 --> 11:49.447
Which part of this is vacation?

11:49.534 --> 11:50.884
Armor-Alling
the tires

11:50.971 --> 11:52.494
for six hours,
or scraping the dead bugs

11:52.581 --> 11:54.757
out of the grill
with a toothbrush?

11:54.844 --> 11:56.933
Why do they have to play Frisbee
so close to the RV?

11:57.020 --> 11:58.326
Can't they have
fun with that thing

11:58.413 --> 12:00.284
without constantly
throwing it around?

12:00.371 --> 12:02.634
And where's Malcolm? Did he even
come home last night?

12:02.722 --> 12:04.027
I gotta tell you, Lois,

12:04.114 --> 12:06.029
I really don't think
I like this place.

12:06.116 --> 12:08.118
I think I love this place.

12:10.164 --> 12:12.166
No, I'm sure I do.

12:12.253 --> 12:13.254
Good morning.

12:13.341 --> 12:14.908
Did you know...

12:14.995 --> 12:16.997
you are the most incredible
woman who ever lived?

12:17.084 --> 12:19.173
Well, I knew I was
in the top three,

12:19.260 --> 12:21.566
but I guess your vote
clinches it.

12:21.653 --> 12:25.440
So, are we going to spend
the day together?

12:25.527 --> 12:28.008
I thought we could go check out
the Circle of Infinity...

12:28.095 --> 12:30.619
Oh, I have a ton of re-birthing
ceremonies to do today.

12:30.706 --> 12:32.577
But we can get together
later. How about that?

12:32.664 --> 12:35.276
Sure, that sounds great.

12:35.363 --> 12:36.494
What's the matter?

12:36.581 --> 12:38.018
Nothing.

12:38.105 --> 12:39.149
I'm happy.

12:39.236 --> 12:41.021
-Really, really happy.
-No,

12:41.108 --> 12:43.980
there's something the matter,
but I just can't pin it down.

12:44.067 --> 12:45.329
Nothing's wrong.

12:45.416 --> 12:46.374
You go do your re-birthing
whatevers,

12:46.461 --> 12:48.028
and we'll get together later.

12:48.115 --> 12:50.378
-Contempt. That's it.
-What are you talking about?

12:50.465 --> 12:52.206
You have contempt for
me and for what I do.

12:52.293 --> 12:53.860
No, no, not at all.

12:53.947 --> 12:55.470
I should really just keep
my mouth shut

12:55.557 --> 12:56.558
for the next five seconds.

12:56.645 --> 12:58.821
Four, three...

12:58.908 --> 13:00.780
I mean, it is
a pretty silly ritual,

13:00.867 --> 13:03.086
but I guess I don't see
any real harm in it.

13:03.173 --> 13:04.435
You know, I have
a lot to do today,

13:04.522 --> 13:05.915
and I think you
should probably go.

13:06.002 --> 13:07.743
-No...
-Good-bye, Malcolm.

13:18.101 --> 13:20.930
This guy's really captured
something here.

13:21.017 --> 13:24.238
This piece is as vicious
as it is funny.

13:24.325 --> 13:26.196
What are you looking at?!

13:26.283 --> 13:27.589
Haven't you ever seen a man

13:27.676 --> 13:30.810
sweep his lawn
with a broom before?

13:30.897 --> 13:32.333
[applause]

13:32.420 --> 13:34.509
Okay, that's enough.
I've had it.

13:34.596 --> 13:35.684
Go on, get out of here,
you punks.

13:35.771 --> 13:38.121
[cheering, louder applause]

13:43.648 --> 13:46.434
What the hell is wrong
with you people?!

13:46.521 --> 13:50.699
Doesn't anybody have respect
for personal property anymore?

13:50.786 --> 13:52.614
You can think about that
for a few days

13:52.701 --> 13:54.703
until I give this back to you.

13:54.790 --> 13:57.010
[wild applause]

13:57.097 --> 13:58.185
No!

14:04.539 --> 14:06.323
[liquid gurgling]

14:06.410 --> 14:09.587
I bet orphanages
don't take family trips...

14:09.674 --> 14:12.242
or kids raised by animals.

14:12.329 --> 14:14.244
How come they get
all the breaks?

14:18.988 --> 14:19.946
Okay, Lois,

14:20.033 --> 14:22.035
you can open your eyes now.

14:25.299 --> 14:26.343
Oh, my gosh.

14:26.430 --> 14:27.910
This is fantastic.

14:27.997 --> 14:29.346
Oh...!

14:29.433 --> 14:30.826
I wish there was
a JC Penney nearby.

14:30.913 --> 14:32.872
I'd love to get wallets of this.

14:34.221 --> 14:35.657
Who's stupid idea was it
to come here, anyway?

14:35.744 --> 14:37.354
I'm with you, Malcolm.

14:37.441 --> 14:39.052
We don't belong here.

14:39.139 --> 14:41.489
This place is full of freaks
and weirdoes.

14:41.576 --> 14:44.100
And now your mother and Jamie
are out there with them,

14:44.187 --> 14:45.667
doing God knows what.

14:46.798 --> 14:48.148
You're going to be okay,
Malcolm,

14:48.235 --> 14:49.410
because you are just like me.

14:49.497 --> 14:51.412
-I am?
-Well, sure.

14:51.499 --> 14:53.980
They say we're stubborn,
they say we're closed-minded,

14:54.067 --> 14:55.938
but I say there's
nothing closed-minded

14:56.025 --> 14:59.028
about shunning ideas that make
you scared and uncomfortable.

14:59.115 --> 15:00.203
Yeah.

15:00.290 --> 15:01.509
And who cares

15:01.596 --> 15:02.858
if they say
we're afraid of life?

15:02.945 --> 15:04.773
Life is scary.

15:04.860 --> 15:05.905
Life is

15:05.992 --> 15:07.863
things eating things.

15:07.950 --> 15:11.258
I say let everyone out there
go ahead and eat each other.

15:11.345 --> 15:13.260
You and I--

15:13.347 --> 15:14.261
we're gonna be in here

15:14.348 --> 15:16.176
together, safe and sound.

15:21.094 --> 15:22.399
I've been a total idiot.

15:22.486 --> 15:23.661
I have to get over myself.

15:23.748 --> 15:25.533
Where are you going?

15:25.620 --> 15:27.839
Don't walk away from me when
I'm talking to you, young man!

15:27.927 --> 15:30.233
[roar of applause]

15:32.018 --> 15:34.977
[screaming]

15:36.761 --> 15:40.635
Get... off... my... property!

15:40.722 --> 15:42.898
[cheering]

15:53.561 --> 15:55.302
What? What did I do?

15:57.130 --> 15:58.522
Come with us.

15:58.609 --> 15:59.915
Wait. I want my lawyer.

16:00.002 --> 16:01.525
He's the naked guy
in the buffalo head.

16:01.612 --> 16:03.571
It's okay, Reese,
you're not in any trouble.

16:03.658 --> 16:05.051
We want you to be
the torchbearer

16:05.138 --> 16:06.487
for the big
Burning Man ceremony.

16:06.574 --> 16:07.531
You do?

16:07.618 --> 16:09.011
Absolutely.

16:09.098 --> 16:10.621
I can't think of anyone
who has embraced

16:10.708 --> 16:13.015
and embodied the spirit of
the festival more than you have.

16:13.102 --> 16:14.799
Really?

16:14.886 --> 16:16.845
Wow.

16:16.932 --> 16:19.282
Hey, don't say anything
to my lawyer, okay?

16:19.369 --> 16:21.676
I don't want to have to
give him a piece of this.

16:21.763 --> 16:26.333
THE SHAMAN: Open yourselves
to the energy of re-birthing.

16:26.420 --> 16:29.118
GROUP [chanting]:
The old self dies.

16:29.205 --> 16:30.380
-[shrieking]
-A new self is born.

16:30.467 --> 16:32.513
The old self dies.

16:32.600 --> 16:35.733
A new self is born.

16:35.820 --> 16:37.387
The old self dies.

16:37.474 --> 16:39.433
A new self is born.

16:39.520 --> 16:43.219
[crying]

16:43.306 --> 16:44.829
I can do this.

16:44.916 --> 16:46.309
I can be open-minded.

16:46.396 --> 16:47.876
So it's a little weird.

16:47.963 --> 16:49.486
Most rituals are
a little weird, right?

16:49.573 --> 16:51.575
[baby whimpers]

16:52.576 --> 16:55.014
He really needs
a fresh start.

16:55.101 --> 16:57.364
He made a lot of mistakes
his first two days.

16:58.974 --> 17:01.237
Okay, so it's totally insane.

17:01.324 --> 17:03.674
I don't care. I'm doing it.

17:15.904 --> 17:18.819
I got to tell you, man,
you've been fantastic.

17:18.906 --> 17:20.691
Thanks.

17:20.778 --> 17:23.215
-What's this for?
-What's it for?

17:23.303 --> 17:25.261
It's to set him on fire.

17:25.348 --> 17:26.609
[people chanting]
Burning Man!

17:26.696 --> 17:28.002
What?!

17:28.089 --> 17:29.265
That's how we end
Burning Man, man--

17:29.352 --> 17:30.745
by burning the man.

17:30.832 --> 17:33.182
But it can't end.
I don't want it to.

17:33.269 --> 17:36.142
For the first time in my life,
I feel real, like I belong.

17:36.229 --> 17:38.579
We've all been there, man,
but it still has to end.

17:38.666 --> 17:40.015
But why?

17:40.102 --> 17:41.625
That's just the way it is.

17:41.712 --> 17:43.453
Look, it's cool
if you don't want to...

17:43.540 --> 17:44.715
Get back!

17:44.802 --> 17:46.021
Everyone just stay back!

17:46.108 --> 17:47.588
No one's burning
Burning Man!

17:47.675 --> 17:48.763
[chanting]
Burning Man!

18:00.122 --> 18:01.645
Malcolm?

18:01.732 --> 18:03.560
What are you doing here?

18:03.647 --> 18:04.648
I did it.

18:04.735 --> 18:05.954
I actually did it.

18:06.041 --> 18:08.478
You re-birthed yourself...
for me?

18:08.565 --> 18:12.091
No. Well, yeah, originally,
but something happened in there.

18:12.178 --> 18:14.049
I mean, I was able
to open my mind

18:14.136 --> 18:15.920
and be accepting of something
I didn't believe in.

18:16.007 --> 18:17.879
I've never been able
to do that before.

18:17.966 --> 18:20.621
It's amazing; I actually
feel like I've been reborn.

18:20.708 --> 18:23.841
It feels fantastic, and
it's all thanks to you.

18:23.928 --> 18:25.756
Oh, Malcolm.

18:25.843 --> 18:27.367
We can never
see each other again.

18:27.454 --> 18:29.195
-What?
-This can never work.

18:29.282 --> 18:30.935
You're just
way too malleable.

18:31.022 --> 18:33.503
The condescending cynic
I could deal with, but this...

18:33.590 --> 18:35.070
I don't want you doing things

18:35.157 --> 18:36.245
just because I want you
to do them.

18:36.332 --> 18:38.943
Then I won't,
if that's what you want.

18:39.030 --> 18:40.380
Crap.

18:40.467 --> 18:42.164
I'm sorry, Malcolm.
Life is a journey

18:42.251 --> 18:43.948
that you have to take
on your own.

18:44.035 --> 18:45.950
I've tried my own journey.
It sucks.

18:46.037 --> 18:47.909
Please, please, please,
just take me with you.

18:47.996 --> 18:49.650
I don't take up
a lot of space.

18:49.737 --> 18:50.999
-You have to go now.
-But...

18:53.262 --> 18:54.611
Great.

18:54.698 --> 18:56.047
Who knew this life
could be even crappier

18:56.135 --> 18:57.788
than the last one?

18:57.875 --> 18:59.312
[all chanting]
Burning Man! Burning Man!

18:59.399 --> 19:01.140
REESE:
No! Stay back! Stay back!

19:01.227 --> 19:03.403
I mean it!

19:03.490 --> 19:05.753
[horn blaring tune]

19:08.147 --> 19:10.018
Get in the van, Reese.
We're going home.

19:10.105 --> 19:11.280
Dad, you gotta help me.

19:11.367 --> 19:13.195
They want me to burn
Burning Man.

19:13.282 --> 19:14.718
Oh, for crying out loud,

19:14.805 --> 19:16.503
just torch the bastard
and we're out of here.

19:16.590 --> 19:19.506
I'm ready. I finally got
your precious floor mats clean.

19:19.593 --> 19:20.942
Let's get the
hell out of here.

19:21.029 --> 19:23.466
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Are you insane?

19:23.553 --> 19:24.859
You're not going into
my beautiful van

19:24.946 --> 19:26.034
looking like that.

19:26.121 --> 19:27.340
MAN:
Hey!

19:27.427 --> 19:28.645
Here come the Trumpet Strumpets.

19:28.732 --> 19:30.473
Let's burn the man!

19:30.560 --> 19:32.171
[wild cheering]

19:34.390 --> 19:37.437
[trumpets blowing]

19:50.972 --> 19:52.452
Reese.

19:52.539 --> 19:54.889
You behave yourself, young man.
You hear me?

19:56.804 --> 19:58.371
You look incredible, honey.

19:58.458 --> 19:59.720
Now get in the van.

19:59.807 --> 20:02.113
REESE:
No! No, please!

20:02.201 --> 20:05.682
[chanting louder]:
Burning Man! Burning Man!
Burning Man! Burning Man!

20:05.769 --> 20:07.467
REESE:
Please, no!

20:07.554 --> 20:08.555
No!

20:08.642 --> 20:11.210
No! Burning Man can't end!

20:11.297 --> 20:13.429
I won't let it!

20:21.307 --> 20:25.311
[uproarious cheering]

20:30.707 --> 20:34.537
[chanting]
Burning van! Burning van!
Burning van! Burning van...!

20:34.624 --> 20:36.409
[chanting continues]

20:45.679 --> 20:48.899
I still can't believe
how awesome Burning Man was.

20:48.986 --> 20:51.119
Next year
we're totally going back, right?

20:51.206 --> 20:53.382
[whispers]:
Totally.

20:53.469 --> 20:55.341
Okay, so Burning Man

20:55.428 --> 20:57.081
didn't turn out as great
as I thought it would.

20:57.168 --> 20:59.301
But I think I'll get over it
a lot faster than Dad will.

20:59.388 --> 21:01.738
His boss really loved
that RV.

21:01.825 --> 21:03.436
Don't wait up.

21:03.523 --> 21:05.699
I probably won't be home
until dawn again.

21:05.786 --> 21:08.092
Tonight I'm digging him
a new septic tank.

21:08.179 --> 21:09.964
Come on, Dewey.

21:10.051 --> 21:12.923
First we gotta relocate
the pet cemetery.

21:53.703 --> 21:55.618
