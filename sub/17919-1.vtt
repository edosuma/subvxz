when we were still
being hunted by Muggles.

01:04:14.227 --> 01:04:17.897
Young wizards and witches
sometimes tried to suppress their magic

01:04:18.064 --> 01:04:19.607
to avoid persecution.

01:04:21.150 --> 01:04:24.612
<i>So, instead of learning to harness
or to control their powers,</i>

01:04:25.988 --> 01:04:28.950
they developed
what was called an Obscurus.

01:04:31.827 --> 01:04:34.163
It's an unstable,
uncontrollable dark force

01:04:34.330 --> 01:04:36.332
that busts out and attacks.

01:04:39.585 --> 01:04:41.337

01:07:10.403 --> 01:07:12.905

01:07:13.864 --> 01:07:15.104
Why would I do it deliberately?

01:08:01.328 --> 01:08:03.247
