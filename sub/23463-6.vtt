00:37.440 --> 00:40.550
'Who can forget the
return to work and school

00:40.600 --> 00:41.830
after the summer?

00:42.480 --> 00:45.650
Immaculate shoes, the
pristine pencil case,

00:45.700 --> 00:49.110
the promise that this year,
homework would be done on time,

00:49.160 --> 00:51.560
in absolutely perfect writing.

00:55.300 --> 00:56.510
Oh, for goodness' sake!

00:56.560 --> 00:58.240
Sorry! Sorry!

00:59.520 --> 01:00.950
Mum, stop fussing.

01:01.800 --> 01:02.630
Are you all right?

01:02.680 --> 01:04.629
- I'm fine! - You sure?
- I said I'm fine! - OK.

01:04.680 --> 01:08.350
The prospect of a fresh start
is always an exciting one.

01:08.400 --> 01:10.870
A clean sheet, an open book.

01:10.920 --> 01:13.170
The chance to start again.

01:16.080 --> 01:17.390
Are we nearly there yet?

01:17.440 --> 01:20.270
I think it's just around the next corner.

01:20.320 --> 01:21.790
You said that ages ago!

01:21.840 --> 01:24.390
Yeah, well, it's a big place, this London.

01:24.440 --> 01:26.840
How do we know we're not
living in the Catholic bit?

01:27.920 --> 01:30.630
Look, stuff like that doesn't matter here.

01:30.680 --> 01:33.600
People in London live
mixed up all together.

01:35.840 --> 01:39.620
- Oh, there, there, there it is! There!
- Hey, look! Look!

01:55.920 --> 01:58.950
I mean, it's just like
the photo! It's perfect.

01:59.000 --> 02:01.350
All stocked up and ready to go.

02:01.400 --> 02:04.080
Kids, grab your bags!

02:07.480 --> 02:08.870
This place opening up again?

02:08.919 --> 02:09.949
It certainly is.

02:10.000 --> 02:11.950
Terry Davidson, proprietor.

02:12.000 --> 02:14.030
- This is the missus, Pearl.
- Hello.

02:14.080 --> 02:15.710
We've just taken over the lease.

02:15.760 --> 02:17.950
Fred Buckle. Pleased to meet you.

02:18.000 --> 02:20.150
Is that an Irish accent I'm hearing?

02:20.200 --> 02:21.950
Northern Irish. Is that a problem?

02:22.000 --> 02:23.190
Well, not for me.

02:23.240 --> 02:25.150
As long as you sell the Sporting Life,

02:25.200 --> 02:27.240
me and you are going
to be the best of chums!

02:30.720 --> 02:32.590
Right.

02:32.640 --> 02:34.440
Close your eyes and open your hands.

02:44.600 --> 02:45.710
I love it.

02:45.760 --> 02:47.510
I had it made before we left.

02:47.560 --> 02:49.760
I thought you could put
it up above the door.

02:52.080 --> 02:53.990
Is there anything you haven't thought of?

02:54.040 --> 02:57.270
Food. I think we passed a
chipper a few streets back.

02:57.320 --> 02:59.350
All right, well, I'll
nip out and get some.

02:59.400 --> 03:01.840
You make a start on the
shop. The kids can help.

03:06.280 --> 03:08.630
The first session, I call "the three Ps."

03:08.680 --> 03:11.520
Puberty, periods, and pongs.

03:13.080 --> 03:14.520
Personal hygiene.

03:15.680 --> 03:17.310
All the girls in the class are over 16,

03:17.360 --> 03:19.110
so they've been through most of it,

03:19.160 --> 03:22.150
but you'd be surprised how little
they know about their own bodies.

03:22.200 --> 03:25.110
Mind you, I thought that babies
came out through the belly button

03:25.160 --> 03:26.390
when I was little!

03:26.440 --> 03:30.310
The first day of midwifery training
must have been an eye-opener!

03:31.960 --> 03:34.590
It's good of the youth
club to run the classes.

03:34.640 --> 03:36.190
But... I can't help thinking

03:36.240 --> 03:39.390
a girl should be taught
these things by her mother.

03:39.440 --> 03:42.510
Not every parent is up to the job.

03:42.560 --> 03:45.560
They prefer to leave
the embarrassment to us.

03:47.160 --> 03:48.200
Oh...

03:49.360 --> 03:52.640
Don't be nervous, just follow my lead.

03:54.560 --> 03:56.360
Right, I think we're all set.

03:57.360 --> 03:58.800
Oh, hang on.

04:02.840 --> 04:04.940
The girls always want to know about these.

04:07.040 --> 04:08.360
Tampons?

04:09.600 --> 04:11.040
For unmarried girls?

04:12.000 --> 04:13.040
Come on.

04:15.720 --> 04:18.079
? It ain't right to wanna keep on dancing

04:20.200 --> 04:25.150
? There won't be any
time left for romancing

04:25.200 --> 04:28.030
? Come outside

04:28.080 --> 04:29.830
? Come outside

04:29.880 --> 04:32.830
? There's a lovely moon out there... ?

04:42.280 --> 04:43.630
Sorry I'm late.

04:43.680 --> 04:46.230
My mum forgot to sign my permission slip.

04:46.280 --> 04:47.480
Thank you.

04:49.520 --> 04:51.790
But whatever you call your monthlies,

04:51.840 --> 04:54.550
there's no need for them to
interfere with your daily life,

04:54.600 --> 04:57.000
especially with modern
sanitary protection.

05:00.360 --> 05:03.830
You're probably familiar with
this style of sanitary belt --

05:03.880 --> 05:04.950
it's standard issue.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.750
Unlike the old days, pads are disposable,

05:07.800 --> 05:10.710
and you can buy them at
any chemist in all sizes.

05:10.760 --> 05:13.360
But there are also other options.

05:16.400 --> 05:18.750
Tampons are worn internally,

05:18.800 --> 05:21.470
and come with a little
cardboard applicator

05:21.520 --> 05:23.750
so you can get them in
just the right position.

05:23.800 --> 05:26.830
Or you can just wear something like this.

05:26.880 --> 05:28.430
Well, yes.

05:28.480 --> 05:31.710
But you can't go swimming
in a sanitary belt,

05:31.760 --> 05:35.310
or wear it under your swimsuit
on the beach on a sunny day.

05:35.360 --> 05:39.310
There are very few days one can wear
a swimsuit on the beach in England.

05:39.360 --> 05:40.630
Yes.

05:40.680 --> 05:43.150
So it's very annoying

05:43.200 --> 05:46.510
if you happen to be on your period
on the one day the sun is shining.

05:46.560 --> 05:49.390
Anyway, pass them round.
See what you think.

05:49.440 --> 05:51.000
Elizabeth, you first.

05:54.400 --> 05:56.750
You might try to be a bit more positive.

05:56.800 --> 05:57.790
Sorry.

05:57.840 --> 05:59.320
But you know my views.

06:03.680 --> 06:06.390
I sent him out for chips an hour ago!

06:06.440 --> 06:09.070
He'll have gone to see a man about a dog.

06:09.120 --> 06:10.160
Hmm...

06:14.800 --> 06:16.120
Excuse me?

06:17.320 --> 06:20.720
We're making enquiries about
a Mr Terence Davidson.

06:22.280 --> 06:23.600
I'm his wife.

06:31.960 --> 06:34.670
I thought I heard rustling!

06:34.720 --> 06:38.710
I am instructed to pack for the hospital.

06:38.760 --> 06:42.510
Standard provisions would be
a nightgown and toiletry bag.

06:42.560 --> 06:44.510
But what about nourishment?

06:44.560 --> 06:48.910
Keats may feed my brain,
but what about my belly?

06:48.960 --> 06:50.550
Sister Monica Joan.

06:50.600 --> 06:52.830
Provisions for the hospital.

06:52.880 --> 06:56.110
The operation isn't until next week.

06:56.160 --> 07:00.680
I suggest... we revisit your
preparations in the morning.

07:09.200 --> 07:11.990
So how was that, then?
Do anything interesting?

07:12.040 --> 07:13.720
Only table tennis.

07:15.160 --> 07:16.510
Oh.

07:16.560 --> 07:19.320
It's late, Elizabeth. Let's get you home.

07:28.280 --> 07:29.790
Today, is it?

07:29.840 --> 07:32.790
Fred Buckle. I met your
husband the day you arrived.

07:32.840 --> 07:35.350
I've been looking in
the papers for a notice.

07:35.400 --> 07:37.990
There wasn't one. No-one
round here knew Terry.

07:38.040 --> 07:40.750
I would come. I still could. I
could nip home and get changed.

07:40.800 --> 07:43.350
Thank you, but it's a family funeral only.

07:43.400 --> 07:44.840
I've been in your shoes.

07:46.640 --> 07:49.310
If there's anything that you
need, anything at all, just ask.

07:49.360 --> 07:51.550
Thank you, Mr Buckle,
I know you mean well,

07:51.600 --> 07:53.670
but you needn't concern
yourself with my troubles.

07:53.720 --> 07:55.670
I can manage perfectly well on my own.

07:55.720 --> 08:01.240
Come on, kids. Good day, Mr Buckle.

08:18.720 --> 08:21.630
Oh! Is today the big day?

08:21.680 --> 08:23.630
The planets are not well aligned.

08:23.680 --> 08:24.990
Oh. Oh, dear.

08:25.040 --> 08:26.950
Thank you, Nurse Hereward,

08:27.000 --> 08:30.230
but we'd like to accomplish this
with as little fuss as possible.

08:30.280 --> 08:32.070
Come along, Sister Monica Joan.

08:32.120 --> 08:34.000
Good luck at the hospital.

08:38.440 --> 08:41.270
What sort of business do
you have, Mrs Davidson?

08:41.320 --> 08:42.600
It's a newsagent.

08:43.960 --> 08:46.430
I find it hard to leave
during business hours.

08:46.480 --> 08:47.910
I can't afford to lose the trade.

08:47.960 --> 08:51.200
Oh, is there no-one who can
help you? Your husband?

08:52.360 --> 08:53.960
He was killed in a car accident.

08:55.720 --> 08:57.230
Just after we arrived.

08:57.280 --> 08:58.680
I'm sorry.

09:00.120 --> 09:02.950
Do you have any family in England?

09:03.000 --> 09:04.710
No.

09:04.760 --> 09:07.680
But me and Terry, we
stood on our own feet.

09:08.840 --> 09:10.790
And that's what I'm going to keep doing.

09:10.840 --> 09:16.280
And I am going to get a midwife to
visit you at home, Mrs Davidson.

09:17.560 --> 09:21.280
With luck, someone should
come out to you this evening.

09:22.280 --> 09:23.480
Very well.

09:25.000 --> 09:27.390
But you must tell her
if you're struggling.

09:27.440 --> 09:29.080
I'm not struggling, thank you.

09:30.080 --> 09:31.520
I'm very capable.

09:34.680 --> 09:37.710
There. Sister Winifred and
I have drawn up a rota,

09:37.760 --> 09:39.990
so one of us will visit every day.

09:40.040 --> 09:41.990
You won't be on your own.

09:42.040 --> 09:46.870
Sometimes, solitude is the best society.

09:46.920 --> 09:50.430
Whoo! Ooh! Giddy-up, giddy-up!

09:52.040 --> 09:56.000
Oh! You young men can take me round
the block any day of the week!

09:57.280 --> 10:00.110
There's not many fellas
take my missus for a ride,

10:00.160 --> 10:02.390
- and lives to tell the tale!
- Oh!

10:03.880 --> 10:05.990
Oh, sorry, Sister.

10:06.040 --> 10:08.030
Albie Valentine.

10:08.080 --> 10:10.230
And this is my missus, Maudie.

10:10.280 --> 10:13.310
She'd never normally be
fruity in front of a nun,

10:13.360 --> 10:14.790
but she didn't see you there.

10:14.840 --> 10:16.670
She's blind as an old bat!

10:16.720 --> 10:19.030
I'm in to get me cataract done.

10:19.080 --> 10:23.470
Ripe as a French fig,
and ready for slicing!

10:23.520 --> 10:27.870
I'm Mrs Shelagh Turner, and
this is Sister Monica Joan.

10:27.920 --> 10:29.870
Order of Saint Raymond Nonnatus.

10:29.920 --> 10:32.870
Then there's no need to
stand on ceremony, Albie.

10:32.920 --> 10:35.070
Nonnatons -- they've seen it all!

10:35.120 --> 10:37.310
Oh, yeah, your lot delivered all of ours.

10:37.360 --> 10:40.760
If you don't remember Maudie's face,
you might remember the other half!

10:42.200 --> 10:44.990
I imagine your wife wants to get settled.

10:45.040 --> 10:47.950
Plenty time to catch up later.

10:48.000 --> 10:51.190
Now, where's that handsome young man?

10:51.240 --> 10:53.550
He needs to get me into bed!

10:59.840 --> 11:01.070
Hello?

11:01.120 --> 11:02.240
Shop?

11:04.480 --> 11:05.990
You'll need to be quick.

11:06.040 --> 11:07.510
I'm cashing up.

11:07.560 --> 11:09.990
Aren't you a little young
to be a shop keeper?

11:10.040 --> 11:11.910
I'm the man round here now.

11:11.960 --> 11:14.470
Well, before you ring up for the night,

11:14.520 --> 11:16.920
may I trouble you for a
bag of flying saucers?

11:21.000 --> 11:23.750
My daddy says these taste
like communion wafers.

11:23.800 --> 11:27.190
I agree. But my husband
can't get enough of them.

11:27.240 --> 11:30.320
But then, he is a vicar, so
that might explain things.

11:31.680 --> 11:34.150
Mrs Davidson? Nurse Hereward, midwife.

11:34.200 --> 11:35.920
I believe you're expecting me.

11:39.840 --> 11:42.950
The egg travels down the
fallopian tube to the uterus.

11:43.000 --> 11:45.590
And, if it meets a male seed, or sperm...

11:46.920 --> 11:50.150
.. then the two cells unite,
and a baby begins to grow.

11:50.200 --> 11:51.790
Any questions? Yep.

11:51.840 --> 11:54.950
My sister says that if a lady
goes for a wee after doing it,

11:55.000 --> 11:57.870
then it washes out the man's seed,
and the lady won't fall for a baby.

11:57.920 --> 11:59.430
Mmm. Not true.

11:59.480 --> 12:03.630
If you look here, you can see
the urinary tract and the vagina

12:03.680 --> 12:05.040
are completely separate.

12:06.800 --> 12:08.400
Nurse Anderson?

12:09.800 --> 12:12.430
Please copy the picture on the board,

12:12.480 --> 12:16.400
and label the body parts with
their anatomically correct names.

12:20.840 --> 12:23.670
There. Wasn't too bad, was it?

12:23.720 --> 12:25.390
If they were to ask me those questions,

12:25.440 --> 12:26.790
I wouldn't know where to look.

12:26.840 --> 12:29.630
You look 'em right in the eye,
and you give it to 'em straight.

12:29.680 --> 12:30.950
Better that than they go round

12:31.000 --> 12:32.910
with their heads stuffed full of nonsense.

12:32.960 --> 12:34.960
Ah... come on, girls, knuckle down.

12:40.800 --> 12:43.310
If your others were both nine-pounders,

12:43.360 --> 12:46.720
it's no surprise this
one's a good size, too.

12:51.720 --> 12:53.270
Oh!

12:53.320 --> 12:54.990
Active, as well.

12:55.040 --> 12:56.950
You must be getting kicked to bits.

12:57.000 --> 12:59.470
I haven't really been paying attention.

12:59.520 --> 13:00.550
No.

13:00.600 --> 13:03.880
I can only imagine how
difficult it's been.

13:14.080 --> 13:16.750
Is the flat good enough? I've
scrubbed it top to bottom.

13:16.800 --> 13:18.510
Just don't judge me on me curtains.

13:18.560 --> 13:22.430
That window looks onto a brick
wall, and that one's got bars.

13:22.480 --> 13:24.710
It's fine for a home delivery.

13:24.760 --> 13:25.960
And spotless.

13:27.200 --> 13:29.910
Though you might want to
get rid of these boxes --

13:29.960 --> 13:31.560
they don't leave much space.

13:32.840 --> 13:34.360
They're Terry's things.

13:35.440 --> 13:37.270
I'm so sorry. I...

13:37.320 --> 13:38.750
I didn't think.

13:38.800 --> 13:40.790
I don't know what to do with them.

13:40.840 --> 13:42.670
I could help you go through them.

13:42.720 --> 13:45.350
Or... Or just sit with
you while you do it.

13:45.400 --> 13:47.310
Well, that's not part of your job.

13:47.360 --> 13:50.830
When I'm not being a midwife,
I'm the wife of a curate.

13:50.880 --> 13:54.720
Helping people through life's vile
moments is very much in my remit.

13:55.800 --> 13:58.040
Please. I'd like to help.

13:59.400 --> 14:01.830
Thanks, girls. Don't dally
-- we ran a bit over.

14:01.880 --> 14:03.480
See you next time.

14:06.840 --> 14:08.750
Interesting labelling.

14:08.800 --> 14:12.230
I'm fairly sure that "tuppence"
isn't an anatomical term!

14:13.320 --> 14:14.750
Elizabeth?

14:14.800 --> 14:16.950
Sorry! Just coming.

14:17.000 --> 14:21.040
There you are! I was stood outside
getting worried. Come on, let's go.

14:22.640 --> 14:25.070
What on earth...

14:25.120 --> 14:26.870
Er... it's just an exercise we do,

14:26.920 --> 14:29.360
so the girls know what's what down below.

14:30.480 --> 14:33.950
For the health and relationship class?

14:34.000 --> 14:35.280
The what?

14:36.320 --> 14:38.910
You signed a form for Elizabeth to attend.

14:38.960 --> 14:40.750
I... I saw the slip myself.

14:40.800 --> 14:43.590
I certainly did not!

14:43.640 --> 14:46.790
Why would I want her
exposed to this... filth?

14:46.840 --> 14:48.800
Why do you ruin everything?!

14:49.960 --> 14:51.680
You haven't heard the last of this.

14:54.840 --> 14:58.430
I'm so sorry. I spent longer
with my last lady than I should.

14:58.480 --> 15:01.910
Whoa! Why don't you just
sit down for two minutes.

15:01.960 --> 15:04.630
When we were in Birmingham, I
had time to do our housework.

15:04.680 --> 15:07.030
But now your shirt pile's
getting out of hand.

15:07.080 --> 15:10.190
So leave them. I never used
to iron my shirts before.

15:10.240 --> 15:13.790
I just used to put my jacket on, and
let the creases fall out themselves.

15:13.840 --> 15:16.670
Yes, and when you were
single, that was endearing.

15:16.720 --> 15:19.070
But now, people will just
think I'm a terrible wife.

15:19.120 --> 15:20.960
You are a perfect wife.

15:22.320 --> 15:25.150
I don't know about that, but I'm trying.

15:31.040 --> 15:34.950
Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name...

15:35.000 --> 15:37.310
Six kids I've got, Sister.

15:37.360 --> 15:41.910
Albie would have had more, but I
had to put a stop to it in the end.

15:41.960 --> 15:45.030
Well, nature intervened.

15:45.080 --> 15:48.110
I stood up one day to put on the kettle,

15:48.160 --> 15:50.670
and me insides fell into me knickers.

15:51.840 --> 15:55.390
Course, you'd be no stranger
to that kind of thing.

15:55.440 --> 15:56.910
Please!

15:56.960 --> 16:02.030
I will have peace to say
the offices of the day.

16:02.080 --> 16:03.560
If you say so!

16:05.120 --> 16:07.760
Our Father, who art in heaven...

16:09.120 --> 16:11.230
I've just taken a call from the council.

16:11.280 --> 16:13.590
There's been a complaint about the class

16:13.640 --> 16:18.920
at last night's youth club from a
Mrs Walker, mother of Elizabeth.

16:19.960 --> 16:21.150
Well, Sister...

16:21.200 --> 16:25.030
The allegation that shocks me
the most is that Nurse Anderson

16:25.080 --> 16:30.000
encouraged the girls to produce
drawings of an... indelicate nature.

16:31.640 --> 16:33.110
Oh, my days!

16:33.160 --> 16:37.230
The drawing was my idea, Sister,
and was purely anatomical.

16:37.280 --> 16:39.150
That may well be the case,

16:39.200 --> 16:42.600
but I'm afraid all further
classes will be cancelled...

16:44.160 --> 16:46.230
.. pending investigation.

16:46.280 --> 16:47.360
That's it?

16:48.800 --> 16:50.710
There's nothing we can do?

16:50.760 --> 16:55.120
I suggest a visit to Mrs
Walker, with a fulsome apology.

17:02.920 --> 17:06.839
Her kiddies are about the same
age as my two when I was widowed.

17:08.680 --> 17:10.319
I was away with the war.

17:11.960 --> 17:14.960
It was friends and neighbours
that held my family together.

17:16.640 --> 17:18.910
Mrs Davidson's got none of that.

17:18.960 --> 17:21.270
I popped into the shop the other day,

17:21.319 --> 17:23.630
but I could hardly get a word out of her.

17:23.680 --> 17:24.990
She's a proud woman.

17:26.440 --> 17:28.109
Right, that's you back in action.

17:28.160 --> 17:29.470
Thanks, Fred.

17:29.520 --> 17:30.760
And, er...

17:32.280 --> 17:35.000
- Tell Mrs Davidson I was
asking after her. - Will do.

17:38.720 --> 17:40.680
Mrs Davidson will get there.

17:42.480 --> 17:45.160
We all do... in the end.

17:47.440 --> 17:49.110
Let's get you along to theatre.

17:49.160 --> 17:51.710
No! I have changed my mind!

17:51.760 --> 17:54.430
Go on, off with you! Give me some peace!

17:54.480 --> 17:58.670
It's you who assaults my ears
with your incessant chatter!

17:58.720 --> 18:00.840
Try to be calm, Sister.

18:02.280 --> 18:03.760
It will make things easier.

18:04.840 --> 18:06.470
Pray for me.

18:06.520 --> 18:08.680
And for my immortal soul.

18:12.280 --> 18:14.000
You're in good hands, Sister.

18:15.200 --> 18:17.070
We can only apologise.

18:17.120 --> 18:20.030
If we had known your daughter had
forged her permission slip...

18:20.080 --> 18:22.070
My daughter is not at fault here.

18:22.120 --> 18:23.310
It is you.

18:23.360 --> 18:27.430
Exposing unmarried girls to things
they've no business knowing!

18:27.480 --> 18:29.150
Mrs Walker...

18:29.200 --> 18:30.430
it's my experience

18:30.480 --> 18:33.990
that the more information a
young woman has, the better.

18:34.040 --> 18:39.550
My experience, that precocious
knowledge destroys lives.

18:39.600 --> 18:42.630
I have seen it! Even in my own family.

18:42.680 --> 18:44.960
My sister ruined. So, no!

18:46.080 --> 18:48.390
I will not withdraw my complaint.

18:48.440 --> 18:50.830
In fact, I will not rest
until your classes are banned

18:50.880 --> 18:52.680
from every youth club in the borough!

18:55.000 --> 18:58.480
Elizabeth, show the nurses out.

19:03.160 --> 19:04.590
I'm so sorry.

19:04.640 --> 19:06.550
I never meant to cause any trouble.

19:06.600 --> 19:09.550
Don't worry, it's not your fault.

19:09.600 --> 19:13.110
How else am I supposed to learn anything?

19:13.160 --> 19:15.190
I used to be allowed to go to the library

19:15.240 --> 19:18.230
until she found me reading
a paperback romance.

19:18.280 --> 19:22.110
The youth club was the last
thing I could go to by myself.

19:22.160 --> 19:23.990
She doesn't trust me to go anywhere!

19:24.040 --> 19:27.590
Elizabeth, your mother mentioned
something about her sister.

19:27.640 --> 19:29.150
Auntie Lily.

19:29.200 --> 19:30.790
What do you know about her?

19:30.840 --> 19:32.560
Nothing...

19:33.720 --> 19:34.910
.. except her name.

19:34.960 --> 19:38.080
Elizabeth, I thought you
were showing the nurses out.

19:56.680 --> 19:58.560
I'm alive!

19:59.600 --> 20:00.920
I'm alive!

20:02.040 --> 20:05.430
I have walked through the valley of ether!

20:05.480 --> 20:08.310
And come out the other side.

20:08.360 --> 20:13.230
But you must lie very quietly
to allow things to settle.

20:13.280 --> 20:16.630
The nurse has put sandbags
on either side of your head

20:16.680 --> 20:18.920
to remind you not to turn.

20:20.280 --> 20:22.880
Do you think you can manage to be still?

20:23.960 --> 20:29.480
I shall meditate on stories
of miraculous deliverance.

20:30.560 --> 20:32.200
What an excellent idea.

20:34.120 --> 20:37.750
But first, perhaps... a little sleep.

20:37.800 --> 20:40.630
I can sleep when I'm dead.

20:42.440 --> 20:43.880
But for now...

20:45.560 --> 20:47.990
.. I am alive!

20:50.280 --> 20:52.280
I am alive!

20:56.520 --> 21:00.710
Mrs Davidson, forgive me
if I'm speaking out of turn,

21:00.760 --> 21:04.470
but... have you given any thought
to going back to Ireland?

21:04.520 --> 21:06.790
There's no future for us there.

21:06.840 --> 21:08.760
Terry made me see that.

21:11.240 --> 21:13.710
Though I'd never have
made the move without him.

21:13.760 --> 21:15.160
He made me brave.

21:16.200 --> 21:17.710
He always had a plan.

21:17.760 --> 21:19.270
"Let's have another baby!"

21:19.320 --> 21:21.550
"Lease the shop!" "Move to England!"

21:21.600 --> 21:23.790
Look at us now!

21:23.840 --> 21:26.310
Hundreds of miles from home,
and not a penny in the bank,

21:26.360 --> 21:27.910
and him nowhere to be seen.

21:27.960 --> 21:29.670
And I'm not brave!

21:29.720 --> 21:31.270
Not any more!

21:31.320 --> 21:32.760
And I hate him for it.

21:34.160 --> 21:35.560
For leaving me here.

21:37.000 --> 21:38.670
God forgive me, but I do!

21:38.720 --> 21:40.990
And I hate that I hate him.

21:41.040 --> 21:43.880
- Because I've loved
him all my life! - Oh!

21:54.560 --> 21:55.600
Oh!

21:56.760 --> 21:58.550
Oh!

21:58.600 --> 21:59.670
Ohh!

21:59.720 --> 22:01.190
Hush now.

22:01.240 --> 22:03.670
All is well.

22:03.720 --> 22:05.070
I can't move!

22:05.120 --> 22:08.430
We are hemmed in by our sheets.

22:08.480 --> 22:12.230
We must lie in our trenches
until our wounds are healed.

22:12.280 --> 22:15.270
This isn't a trench, it's a coffin.

22:15.320 --> 22:18.350
I'm under the earth, buried in blackness.

22:18.400 --> 22:20.830
That's the eye patch!

22:20.880 --> 22:24.390
I fancy we look quite Napoleonic.

22:24.440 --> 22:26.910
I don't like it! Nurse!

22:26.960 --> 22:28.030
Nurse!

22:28.080 --> 22:31.270
Summon your inner strength, Mrs Valentine!

22:31.320 --> 22:33.710
You are the mistress of your vision.

22:33.760 --> 22:35.990
Custodia Occulorum.

22:36.040 --> 22:39.470
Custard? What's custard got to do with it?

22:39.520 --> 22:42.230
No! Not custard!

22:42.280 --> 22:43.790
Custody.

22:43.840 --> 22:47.910
Take custody of your mind's eye.

22:47.960 --> 22:52.430
Instruct it to show you
something wonderful.

22:52.480 --> 22:57.350
The night ablaze with the
shimmering Aurora Borealis.

22:57.400 --> 23:00.870
Or the might of the majestic Zambezi

23:00.920 --> 23:04.520
as it drops like a
curtain at Victoria Falls.

23:06.480 --> 23:09.000
Now. What can you see?

23:10.920 --> 23:12.200
Custard.

23:13.760 --> 23:15.590
Lots and lots of custard.

23:15.640 --> 23:18.960
Ha! So do I!

23:20.120 --> 23:23.280
Oh, it looks delicious!

23:28.760 --> 23:30.630
Oh, I spoke to St Cuthbert's.

23:30.680 --> 23:32.550
Sister Monica Joan had a good night.

23:32.600 --> 23:35.390
- Oh, that's wonderful.
- And I have other news.

23:35.440 --> 23:38.750
Following several letters
of support from parents,

23:38.800 --> 23:41.190
the council have decided
that you may resume

23:41.240 --> 23:43.910
your health and relationship classes.

23:43.960 --> 23:46.390
Thank goodness.

23:46.440 --> 23:50.470
It was very unfair that one
parent could prevent the education

23:50.520 --> 23:51.920
of so many girls.

23:52.960 --> 23:54.870
You've changed your tune.

23:54.920 --> 23:56.270
Not entirely.

23:56.320 --> 23:58.390
But I've been given food for thought.

23:58.440 --> 24:01.390
I have assured the relevant authorities

24:01.440 --> 24:05.910
that you will redouble our efforts
to ensure that all participants

24:05.960 --> 24:08.830
have appropriate parental permission.

24:08.880 --> 24:11.480
Absolutely. Thank you.

24:17.520 --> 24:19.710
Gracious, what a racket!

24:19.760 --> 24:23.510
I hope that sweetie is not
intended for Sister Monica Joan.

24:23.560 --> 24:26.830
She is prone, so at risk of choking.

24:26.880 --> 24:28.310
No, no!

24:28.360 --> 24:34.870
Like a Roman, I have become adept
at the art of recumbent dining.

24:34.920 --> 24:36.350
All the same.

24:36.400 --> 24:38.120
Righto!

24:44.640 --> 24:47.870
I don't know how they all
slipped past the ward sister.

24:47.920 --> 24:50.670
There are strict rules
on the number of visitors.

24:50.720 --> 24:53.910
Now, I thought I might read to you.

24:53.960 --> 24:56.270
Where's your book of Keats?

24:56.320 --> 24:59.310
'Ere, anybody fancy a game
of rummy? I've got me cards.

24:59.360 --> 25:01.240
Yes!

25:03.320 --> 25:08.440
Why don't we start with
Ode on a Grecian Urn?

25:12.040 --> 25:13.110
Welcome back.

25:13.160 --> 25:14.440
Thank you.

25:15.520 --> 25:17.190
I've got everyone's permission slip.

25:17.240 --> 25:19.830
I'm not taking any chances.

25:19.880 --> 25:22.150
Oh, here you all are!

25:22.200 --> 25:27.230
Well, you should all be ashamed
of yourselves! Shame! Shame!

25:27.280 --> 25:29.990
Shame on you, and shame on your parents!

25:30.040 --> 25:32.070
Mrs Walker, that is enough.

25:32.120 --> 25:34.110
Wait until the filth turns your minds,

25:34.160 --> 25:35.950
then your mothers will be sorry!

25:36.000 --> 25:37.230
Girls.

25:37.280 --> 25:39.200
Into the cafe and close the door.

25:40.680 --> 25:43.230
They're children! They're
innocent children!

25:43.280 --> 25:46.950
If you continue to harass my class,
I will be forced to call the police.

25:47.000 --> 25:52.320
I'll call them myself. It's
you who's... peddling filth!

25:58.920 --> 26:01.390
Now, you listen, and you listen good.

26:01.440 --> 26:02.750
You need to drop this.

26:02.800 --> 26:05.910
What, am I to stand by while
you corrupt their young minds?!

26:05.960 --> 26:08.550
Well, I know how it ends!
I've seen with my own eyes!

26:08.600 --> 26:11.520
Mrs Walker! What happened to your sister?

26:12.720 --> 26:14.590
I can't...

26:14.640 --> 26:17.110
If I don't understand, I can't help.

26:17.160 --> 26:19.550
It's too late.

26:19.600 --> 26:21.920
As soon as she did it, it was too late.

26:22.880 --> 26:24.390
Did what?

26:24.440 --> 26:26.190
Up an alley with the boys.

26:26.240 --> 26:29.030
And once she started, she couldn't stop.

26:29.080 --> 26:31.550
Climbing out the window in
the middle of the night,

26:31.600 --> 26:33.840
at it like a sewer rat
until she was ruined.

26:35.200 --> 26:37.990
I can still hear her crying
when they took her away.

26:38.040 --> 26:39.320
Where did she go?

26:41.400 --> 26:42.960
Reform school.

26:44.360 --> 26:45.950
I never saw her again.

26:46.000 --> 26:48.270
Not once in all these years?

26:48.320 --> 26:50.000
I told you what she was like.

26:51.120 --> 26:53.830
Even if I could find
her, why would I want to?

26:53.880 --> 26:55.760
Because she's your family.

26:59.760 --> 27:01.270
Da-da-da!

27:01.320 --> 27:05.270
I must say, that was a
very invigorating recital.

27:05.320 --> 27:08.510
As you know, I'm extremely
partial to Spanish guitar music.

27:08.560 --> 27:11.230
I thought the guitarist
was rather partial to you.

27:11.280 --> 27:12.950
He kept looking your way!

27:13.000 --> 27:15.670
Indeed! The poor chap had a lazy eye.

27:15.720 --> 27:17.270
Oh, Phyllis!

27:19.960 --> 27:22.960
Is that smoke coming
from Mrs Davidson's shop?

27:25.040 --> 27:26.640
The family live above!

27:28.360 --> 27:29.430
Hello?!

27:29.480 --> 27:32.710
- Hello! - The flat's at
the back, they won't hear!

27:32.760 --> 27:34.880
Go and phone the fire brigade, Barbara!

28:11.440 --> 28:12.680
Fire, please.

28:13.840 --> 28:15.080
And an ambulance.

28:16.920 --> 28:18.960
Hello? Hello, up there!

28:32.560 --> 28:34.280
Mrs Davidson!

28:36.320 --> 28:38.200
Mummy? Mummy!

28:39.800 --> 28:42.430
There's someone at the door.

28:46.120 --> 28:47.600
How did they get in?

28:48.760 --> 28:50.680
Did we not lock the shop?

28:57.040 --> 28:58.550
Go away!

28:58.600 --> 29:00.550
Or I'll call the police!

29:00.600 --> 29:03.520
Fire! Fire!

29:10.040 --> 29:13.400
Get the children -- we can lower
them down through the window.

29:14.400 --> 29:17.350
But there's barely six inches
between the glass and the wall.

29:17.400 --> 29:20.750
It looks alarming, but I think
we should take our chances.

29:20.800 --> 29:23.480
Cover the children. Wrap them up well.

29:27.600 --> 29:31.000
Keep your nose and your mouth covered!

29:32.560 --> 29:34.320
Here you are, here's yours.

29:37.960 --> 29:39.510
This is for you.

29:39.560 --> 29:42.710
I'll lead the way, and
you bring up the rear.

29:42.760 --> 29:46.160
Here we go! Now, keep low!

29:47.360 --> 29:49.110
Right, head down, head down.

29:49.160 --> 29:51.680
- Down, down, down!
- Don't breathe too hard.

29:58.080 --> 29:59.560
Phyllis!

30:05.280 --> 30:08.990
Phyllis! This way, this way! Come to me!

30:09.040 --> 30:10.320
Come to me!

30:12.480 --> 30:15.510
That's it, that's it!
Mind the ladder, Phyllis.

30:15.560 --> 30:17.240
Go on, lad. Run to Barbara.

30:20.680 --> 30:22.240
Phyllis!

30:25.560 --> 30:27.350
Help! Help!

30:27.400 --> 30:29.920
My friend, she's inside! Please help!

30:36.120 --> 30:38.070
Help! Please help her!

30:38.120 --> 30:40.080
I think she's trapped!

30:45.560 --> 30:48.030
Phyllis! I thought you were...

30:48.780 --> 30:50.590
It'll take more than a
little thing like a...

30:50.640 --> 30:52.630
fire to finish me off.

30:52.680 --> 30:55.830
Oh! I was so scared for you!

30:55.880 --> 30:56.950
Oh!

30:57.000 --> 30:58.150
Where is everyone?

30:58.200 --> 31:01.230
Is any medical attention required?

31:01.280 --> 31:03.310
Yes, by you!

31:03.360 --> 31:06.060
I think you're in shock, and
you've inhaled a lot of smoke.

31:07.680 --> 31:09.230
Ooh, oh, bother.

31:09.280 --> 31:10.630
- Excuse me?
- Yes?

31:10.680 --> 31:11.950
This lady needs help.

31:12.000 --> 31:14.960
- All right, love.
- Thank you.

31:20.720 --> 31:23.830
- Where have you been, Barbara?
- I'll explain in a minute.

31:23.880 --> 31:25.950
But we have some guests for the night.

31:26.000 --> 31:28.950
I'm afraid you'll all have to
bunk in together in our room.

31:29.000 --> 31:31.750
Why don't you pop into the sitting
room while I make a fresh bed?

31:31.800 --> 31:32.920
Thank you.

31:35.200 --> 31:36.950
You'll need my help.

31:37.000 --> 31:38.640
I'll get some blankets.

31:43.040 --> 31:50.630
? Oh, Lord, abide with me... ?

31:52.520 --> 31:53.910
You choose next.

31:53.960 --> 31:57.790
Oh. The one you taught
me. My new favourite!

31:57.840 --> 31:59.430
Well, you start, then.

31:59.480 --> 32:00.550
Ahem...

32:00.600 --> 32:04.390
? You are my sunshine... ?

32:04.440 --> 32:07.190
Yeah. ? You are my...

32:07.240 --> 32:12.510
? ... sunshine My only sunshine

32:12.560 --> 32:17.200
? You make me happy
when skies are grey... ?

32:18.240 --> 32:20.920
Ah... The children are finally asleep.

32:24.320 --> 32:26.590
I am never letting you
out of my sight again.

32:26.640 --> 32:29.310
- You could have been...
- I was never in any danger.

32:29.360 --> 32:31.910
Phyllis was the hero of the hour.

32:31.960 --> 32:34.950
Excuse me? I'm sorry to interrupt,

32:35.000 --> 32:37.270
but my waters have just broken.

32:37.320 --> 32:38.640
I'm having pains.

32:43.800 --> 32:46.350
You are blessed with your family.

32:46.400 --> 32:48.950
My people were cold fish.

32:49.000 --> 32:51.710
It ain't all fun and games.

32:51.760 --> 32:55.510
The kids bring me their
troubles, and I wear 'em.

32:55.560 --> 32:58.830
And Albie looks cheery enough, but...

32:58.880 --> 33:03.400
he never got over us losing
our youngest in the war.

33:05.640 --> 33:07.750
Some days, he takes to his bed,

33:07.800 --> 33:11.440
and all I can do is hold
him till he stops bawling.

33:16.360 --> 33:18.240
Didn't you ever want a fella?

33:21.280 --> 33:24.190
Jason held a fleeting appeal.

33:24.240 --> 33:27.160
But Odysseus was my one true love.

33:28.240 --> 33:30.000
Local boy, was he?

33:31.040 --> 33:32.790
He felt so to me.

33:32.840 --> 33:35.120
But you chose the church.

33:36.160 --> 33:39.840
I chose a life of service and study.

33:40.960 --> 33:43.320
And the freedom to pursue both.

33:44.360 --> 33:45.800
For me...

33:46.800 --> 33:49.800
.. marriage would have been a jail.

33:57.200 --> 34:00.960
That's it, Pearl. Keep going. Keep going!

34:04.960 --> 34:06.270
Rest. Rest now.

34:06.320 --> 34:07.870
Rest.

34:07.920 --> 34:09.590
Rest for a moment.

34:09.639 --> 34:13.310
You're doing wonderfully. Wonderfully!

34:15.040 --> 34:17.080
Last two times...

34:18.040 --> 34:20.400
.. Terry was outside the door...

34:21.800 --> 34:24.840
.. driving the midwife mad with questions.

34:27.880 --> 34:30.440
I keep looking over to see if he's there.

34:31.760 --> 34:33.110
Oh, Pearl.

34:37.800 --> 34:39.510
Oh! Here we go again.

34:39.560 --> 34:41.199
That's the way.

34:43.800 --> 34:46.469
That's the way! Let's meet baby.

34:46.520 --> 34:51.350
Breathe, breathe, breathe!
Slowly! Slowly! Slowly!

34:51.400 --> 34:54.350
That's it, that's it! Here comes baby.

34:54.400 --> 34:56.719
That's it! That's it!

34:58.880 --> 35:01.230
Oh! Oh, look!

35:02.280 --> 35:03.400
Hello!

35:05.800 --> 35:07.680
Oh, well done!

35:14.440 --> 35:16.510
What is it?

35:16.560 --> 35:18.320
It's a little girl.

35:20.280 --> 35:22.520
Oh, Terry was sure it was a boy.

35:25.080 --> 35:26.230
Wrong again!

35:28.920 --> 35:30.160
Hello!

35:35.320 --> 35:37.280
She's perfect.

35:38.360 --> 35:40.920
Yes, she is.

36:02.840 --> 36:05.200
I'm just going to have a little listen.

36:11.220 --> 36:12.010
Come in.

36:12.360 --> 36:14.030
Ah, perfect timing!

36:14.080 --> 36:17.750
I came to check on you, but I see
I've been overtaken by events.

36:17.800 --> 36:20.830
- How are mother and baby?
- Pearl did wonderfully.

36:20.880 --> 36:24.790
Then I'll leave you to it. I
imagine you both need some sleep.

36:24.840 --> 36:28.310
Actually, doctor, if you wouldn't
mind staying a little longer,

36:28.360 --> 36:31.350
we're not quite out of the woods yet.

36:31.400 --> 36:34.870
Pearl, did anyone suggest to you
that you might be expecting twins?

36:34.920 --> 36:36.720
Ohh...

36:58.320 --> 36:59.680
I can't do this any more.

37:00.760 --> 37:02.150
I'm too tired.

37:02.200 --> 37:07.240
I know you're exhausted, but
your body knows what to do.

37:08.960 --> 37:13.040
We'll just sit here together
quietly until it's time.

37:18.040 --> 37:19.830
Oh, sorry to wake you.

37:19.880 --> 37:21.790
Baby number two is on the way.

37:21.840 --> 37:23.470
I've come for more hot water.

37:23.520 --> 37:27.030
Let me do that -- I'm sure you've
got more important things to do.

37:27.080 --> 37:30.350
It won't be long now, and
you can have your wife back.

37:32.440 --> 37:34.470
That's lovely, Pearl!

37:34.520 --> 37:36.390
I can see baby's head!

37:36.440 --> 37:39.640
Keep that push going as long as you can.

37:40.640 --> 37:43.550
That's it. That's it, now breathe gently.

37:43.600 --> 37:45.400
Breathe... that's it.

37:49.320 --> 37:52.000
And the head is born!

37:53.760 --> 37:55.880
The baby's in its waters!

37:57.760 --> 37:58.750
Ooh!

37:58.800 --> 38:00.920
Hello! Where have you been hiding?

38:02.120 --> 38:04.350
Now, a nice gentle push from you, Pearl.

38:04.400 --> 38:06.550
That's it, that's it.

38:06.600 --> 38:08.280
That's it!

38:10.240 --> 38:11.230
Oh!

38:12.440 --> 38:13.920
Baby is here!

38:15.160 --> 38:16.440
Well done!

38:17.840 --> 38:19.350
Oh, hello!

38:19.400 --> 38:21.990
Oh, well done!

38:22.040 --> 38:23.080
Oh!

38:35.320 --> 38:37.400
You have one of each.

38:38.800 --> 38:40.600
A little boy.

38:55.480 --> 38:57.080
Well done!

39:00.760 --> 39:02.160
You were right.

39:04.320 --> 39:06.390
Whatever she did, she's still my sister.

39:06.440 --> 39:10.150
And she shouldn't be out there
with me not knowing where she is.

39:10.200 --> 39:13.830
So... how do you plan to find her?

39:13.880 --> 39:17.080
My mother was never done threatening
me with that reform school.

39:18.480 --> 39:19.870
I thought if I contacted them,

39:19.920 --> 39:22.910
they might have some idea
where Lily went after she left.

39:22.960 --> 39:25.400
It was a place called Larkhill.

39:27.360 --> 39:30.310
Was it... over the river in Bermondsey?

39:30.360 --> 39:32.470
Yes, I think so.

39:32.520 --> 39:34.590
Do you know it?

39:34.640 --> 39:36.320
Maybe.

39:38.960 --> 39:44.080
But... if it is the same place,
it was never a reform school.

39:46.520 --> 39:48.640
It... It was a mental asylum.

40:15.640 --> 40:17.040
Lily?

40:18.640 --> 40:20.310
Still love to dance?

40:20.360 --> 40:21.790
Mrs Walker?

40:21.840 --> 40:24.360
This is your sister.

41:02.040 --> 41:06.510
Lily was admitted in 1938 when she was 15.

41:06.560 --> 41:10.240
The diagnosis at the
time was moral insanity.

41:11.640 --> 41:15.750
Her family felt she was exhibiting
inappropriate sexual behaviour.

41:15.800 --> 41:19.270
And the doctors here just
took their word for it?

41:19.320 --> 41:21.470
Lily was pregnant when she was admitted.

41:21.520 --> 41:24.030
Er... no, that's not possible.

41:24.080 --> 41:25.670
The child was adopted.

41:25.720 --> 41:27.510
Lily still talks about him.

41:27.560 --> 41:29.600
She was put in here for one mistake?

41:30.720 --> 41:32.200
Why is she still here?

41:33.400 --> 41:34.710
As I say,

41:34.760 --> 41:39.430
Miss Ellingham never really got over
giving up her child for adoption.

41:39.480 --> 41:44.520
If she wasn't mentally disturbed
when she was admitted, she is now?

41:49.560 --> 41:52.790
"Though seen of none save
him whose strenuous tongue

41:52.840 --> 41:56.790
"Can burst Joy's grape
against his palate fine... "

41:56.840 --> 42:00.110
That Keats fellah don't
half write some codswallop!

42:00.160 --> 42:04.310
You want to read a proper writer
like Gwendolyn de la Riche.

42:04.360 --> 42:07.910
Oh... I don't think I'm familiar with her.

42:07.960 --> 42:09.710
Course you are!

42:09.760 --> 42:11.750
Caribbean Kisses?

42:11.800 --> 42:13.520
Doctor's Delight?

42:14.760 --> 42:16.550
I'm afraid I'm drawing a blank.

42:16.600 --> 42:19.360
Call yourself educated women!

42:26.160 --> 42:27.470
That's you?

42:27.520 --> 42:28.760
That's right.

42:30.720 --> 42:32.160
I'm your sister.

42:33.760 --> 42:35.160
Maureen?

42:38.320 --> 42:39.480
Mo?

42:41.160 --> 42:42.320
Mo.

42:46.600 --> 42:48.360
Where's your ribbon?

42:50.440 --> 42:53.360
I stopped wearing ribbons a long time ago.

42:56.920 --> 42:58.320
Oh, Lil.

43:01.680 --> 43:03.950
They never told me you were here.

43:04.000 --> 43:05.960
Or about your baby.

43:07.520 --> 43:10.800
Not even when I was old
enough to understand.

43:13.040 --> 43:14.360
I'm sorry.

43:15.680 --> 43:17.800
I might have been able to help you.

43:19.360 --> 43:21.520
You were always a good little girl.

43:26.100 --> 43:27.580
You've got a niece.

43:29.080 --> 43:30.320
Elizabeth.

43:31.400 --> 43:32.800
That's my little girl.

43:34.800 --> 43:36.270
Well, not so little now.

43:36.320 --> 43:38.320
She's a lovely girl.

43:39.600 --> 43:41.790
I always thought she took
after you more than me.

43:41.840 --> 43:45.830
Although there's a touch of
my husband in there as well.

43:45.880 --> 43:47.120
You're lucky.

43:49.040 --> 43:50.320
Baby.

43:51.640 --> 43:53.040
Husband.

43:55.640 --> 43:57.120
He left.

43:59.080 --> 44:00.400
We weren't...

44:01.480 --> 44:02.840
.. compatible.

44:05.840 --> 44:09.030
He wanted us to... be close.

44:09.080 --> 44:13.320
So did I, I wanted nothing
more, but... I couldn't.

44:16.200 --> 44:18.200
And Mum always said girls who like it...

44:19.400 --> 44:20.880
.. end up in trouble.

44:22.120 --> 44:23.470
Sorry, ladies.

44:23.520 --> 44:25.110
I'm afraid that's visiting over.

44:25.160 --> 44:26.200
Oh!

44:27.440 --> 44:28.680
Don't go.

44:30.200 --> 44:31.720
We'll come back.

44:33.080 --> 44:34.840
Now I know where you are.

44:54.800 --> 44:55.920
Come on.

45:05.800 --> 45:06.990
Is it...

45:07.040 --> 45:08.470
Is it really bad?

45:08.520 --> 45:10.120
The fire damage?

45:11.320 --> 45:12.630
Yes.

45:12.680 --> 45:14.600
I'm afraid it is.

45:20.080 --> 45:22.270
I could lose my children.

45:22.320 --> 45:25.950
I have no home, I have no
means of making a living.

45:26.000 --> 45:27.360
Oh, Pearl.

45:31.640 --> 45:33.680
What a waste of two lives.

45:35.280 --> 45:37.590
Lily Ellingham was damned because she did.

45:37.640 --> 45:40.000
Her sister was damned because she didn't.

45:42.720 --> 45:44.640
I'm sorry I doubted you.

45:45.800 --> 45:47.120
And the classes.

45:48.320 --> 45:49.480
Thank you.

45:50.520 --> 45:54.510
But... I'm not sure the classes would
have saved either of the sisters.

45:54.560 --> 45:56.440
Perhaps not.

45:58.200 --> 46:02.160
But with a little knowledge, they
might have made different choices.

46:10.080 --> 46:12.880
Right, now, hold still while I
pop your new glasses on you.

46:16.360 --> 46:18.680
It may take a while for
your eyes to adjust.

46:30.480 --> 46:32.000
Can you see?

46:42.480 --> 46:43.640
Oh!

46:45.680 --> 46:47.670
It's a miracle!

46:49.800 --> 46:54.480
It's a miracle worthy of the name!

46:56.640 --> 46:58.240
Isn't it?

46:59.280 --> 47:00.060
Oh!

47:04.320 --> 47:06.880
Do they know what caused the fire?

47:08.320 --> 47:10.400
They think it was a cigarette.

47:12.200 --> 47:15.390
The flat is mainly smoke
damage, which is bad enough,

47:15.440 --> 47:18.800
but the shop needs gutting.

47:19.920 --> 47:21.670
The insurance will cover it, won't it?

47:21.720 --> 47:23.390
I'm afraid Mr and Mrs Davidson

47:23.440 --> 47:25.630
hadn't got around to
sorting out insurance.

47:25.680 --> 47:28.630
- Eh? - She had so little before, but...

47:28.680 --> 47:32.310
now she's lost her shop,
and her children are in care

47:32.360 --> 47:34.600
until she can get a roof over her head.

47:35.720 --> 47:37.430
I can do something.

47:37.480 --> 47:40.230
I'll have a word with
the fellas at the CDC.

47:40.280 --> 47:42.080
We'll see her right.

47:43.240 --> 47:46.310
I thought we could look out some
bits for the Davidson babies.

47:46.360 --> 47:48.670
Everything their mother
had will smell of smoke.

47:48.720 --> 47:52.070
Now we just need to find some new
clothes for Alistair and Hazel.

47:52.120 --> 47:54.990
That's in hand. I made an
emergency appeal to the Cubs

47:55.040 --> 47:57.830
to ask their mothers for any
appropriate hand-me-downs.

47:57.880 --> 47:59.950
Early results are very promising.

48:00.000 --> 48:02.070
Goodness! What a haul!

48:02.120 --> 48:04.710
There's a lot of competition
between the sixes.

48:04.760 --> 48:07.790
Parakeets are currently leading
the league of donations.

48:07.840 --> 48:09.720
Surprise, surprise!

48:11.080 --> 48:13.230
Oh, Tommy Parker, their sixer --

48:13.280 --> 48:15.910
a charming boy, but devoid of scruples.

48:15.960 --> 48:19.310
I saw his little sister going
off to school this morning

48:19.360 --> 48:21.750
in shoes but no socks!

48:23.840 --> 48:25.200
? What should I write?

48:26.320 --> 48:27.880
? What can I say?

48:29.240 --> 48:36.120
? How can I tell you how much I miss you?

48:38.680 --> 48:44.040
? The weather here has
been as nice as it can be

48:45.760 --> 48:50.440
? Although it doesn't
really matter much to me

48:51.880 --> 48:57.120
? For all the fun I'll have
while you're so far away

48:58.280 --> 49:02.920
? It might as well rain until September

49:05.640 --> 49:11.030
? I don't need sunny skies
for things I have to do... ?

49:11.080 --> 49:13.150
Come on. Let's get you three home.

49:13.200 --> 49:17.280
? .. home the whole day
long and think of you

49:18.800 --> 49:23.510
? As far as I'm concerned,
each day's a rainy day

49:23.560 --> 49:31.560
? Oh, it might as well
rain until September. ?

49:35.840 --> 49:41.150
"And there, under a Caribbean
sun that was as hot as the fire

49:41.200 --> 49:45.870
"burning in his loins, Sebastian
took her in his arms...

49:45.920 --> 49:47.760
"and kissed her...

49:49.240 --> 49:50.440
".. thoroughly."

49:56.800 --> 49:57.990
Oh!

49:58.040 --> 50:00.510
I missed you two so much!

50:00.560 --> 50:03.630
I'll never go away again, I promise.

50:03.680 --> 50:06.070
Shall we go inside and see
what the lads have done?

50:06.120 --> 50:09.150
Oh, Mr Buckle. It looks
better than it ever did!

50:09.200 --> 50:11.320
Wait till you see inside.

50:21.560 --> 50:22.880
Are those for Aunt Lily?

50:24.480 --> 50:26.830
We hated carbolic when we were kids.

50:26.880 --> 50:29.910
Can't stand thinking of
her using it every day.

50:29.960 --> 50:32.310
Here, you can put a little note in.

50:32.360 --> 50:34.080
Tell her what you're up to.

50:35.440 --> 50:39.160
But I'm... not up to anything, am I?

50:42.760 --> 50:44.550
Library's open tomorrow...

50:44.600 --> 50:46.400
if you want to go?

50:54.080 --> 50:56.070
Oh, the twins are adorable.

50:56.120 --> 50:58.910
Just wait till you see
how much they've grown.

50:58.960 --> 51:01.670
I don't know what Mrs Davidson's thinking.

51:01.720 --> 51:05.830
She's got enough on her hands
without having to entertain people.

51:05.880 --> 51:09.280
She's determined to thank everyone,
and I think we should let her.

51:10.920 --> 51:12.110
Ooh!

51:12.160 --> 51:14.310
Is it me, or is it chilly in here?

51:14.360 --> 51:16.390
You've still not shaken off that cold.

51:17.480 --> 51:20.230
How about I fetch you some tea and toast?

51:20.280 --> 51:23.240
Thank you. That would be a treat.

51:37.760 --> 51:39.760
Sorry, would you prefer Marmite...?

51:50.480 --> 51:53.390
Come down the stall if you fancy a natter.

51:53.440 --> 51:54.950
Or a free bag of plums.

51:55.000 --> 51:57.710
I may take you up on that offer.

51:57.760 --> 52:02.710
You know, at the beginning,
I hated calling you Sister.

52:02.760 --> 52:04.470
Too formal.

52:04.520 --> 52:08.390
But now if feels like the
most normal thing in the world.

52:08.440 --> 52:10.910
Because you are like a sister to me.

52:10.960 --> 52:13.510
And you to me.

52:13.560 --> 52:15.310
Come on, then, old girl.

52:15.360 --> 52:18.030
Let's get you home where you belong.

52:18.080 --> 52:19.600
Go safely.

52:27.960 --> 52:29.790
I wonder who you'll have for company

52:29.840 --> 52:32.430
when you come back to
get the other eye done.

52:32.480 --> 52:36.720
I doubt she'll be as amusing
as Mrs Valentine and her brood.

52:38.920 --> 52:41.190
You've seen both sides.

52:41.240 --> 52:43.200
Which is best?

52:44.520 --> 52:46.960
Well, neither, and both.

52:48.240 --> 52:50.030
We do not choose.

52:50.080 --> 52:51.760
We are chosen.

52:55.560 --> 52:57.230
Caribbean Kisses?

52:57.280 --> 53:00.080
A souvenir from a friend.

53:01.160 --> 53:03.710
You may take it if you wish.

53:03.760 --> 53:06.270
I can put it in the maternity home.

53:06.320 --> 53:08.040
It will be appreciated there.

53:09.160 --> 53:11.230
Though obviously, I'll
have to skim it first

53:11.280 --> 53:12.920
to check that it's suitable.

53:23.320 --> 53:26.630
Tom! Why didn't you wake me!

53:26.680 --> 53:29.870
Because you're not well.
You've been burning up all day.

53:29.920 --> 53:33.520
But I can't miss Mrs
Davidson's party. I... Oh!

53:34.960 --> 53:36.950
Although my head is splitting.

53:37.000 --> 53:40.070
You've been doing too much,
and this is the result.

53:40.120 --> 53:43.030
You are on bed rest until I say so.

53:43.080 --> 53:46.310
I've even hired a nurse to make
sure you stay put this evening.

53:46.360 --> 53:47.710
She'll be right up.

53:47.760 --> 53:49.550
I may be late.

53:49.600 --> 53:53.400
After the party, I need to drop in
on old Mr Hennick on the way home.

54:00.880 --> 54:03.390
I come bearing honey and lemon.

54:03.440 --> 54:05.350
I don't need to be supervised!

54:05.400 --> 54:08.390
I told Mr Hereward to
take all the time he needs.

54:08.440 --> 54:10.390
You really don't have to stay.

54:10.440 --> 54:13.470
And you shouldn't miss
the thank you party.

54:13.520 --> 54:16.960
Knowing that family are back
home is all the thanks I need.

54:18.400 --> 54:20.240
And you do look peaky.

54:22.800 --> 54:24.840
And hot and clammy, too.

54:27.720 --> 54:29.760
- Excuse us!
- Sorry!

54:32.960 --> 54:36.360
Mr Buckle, would I be chancing
my arm if I asked one more favour?

54:42.160 --> 54:44.880
I think my husband would be
happy to have it on the door.

54:46.320 --> 54:49.830
And maybe one day T Davidson
Junior will want the shop.

54:49.880 --> 54:53.190
I thought Alistair was next in
line to run the family business?

54:53.240 --> 54:56.110
Change of plan. He's
going to be an astronaut.

54:56.160 --> 55:01.390
And if Terry has a son of his own,
then it'll all work out perfect.

55:01.440 --> 55:03.080
Yeah, maybe.

55:07.960 --> 55:09.430
How is she?

55:09.480 --> 55:12.070
Fever, headache, and now a rash.

55:12.120 --> 55:14.830
Restricted to her arms
last time I checked.

55:14.880 --> 55:16.760
I'm fine.

55:35.200 --> 55:37.030
- Barbara?
- Mmm?

55:37.080 --> 55:39.400
Can you try and bend your neck?

55:42.040 --> 55:43.240
Oh!

55:45.320 --> 55:46.760
I can't.

55:53.720 --> 55:56.910
I don't want to pre-empt a diagnosis,

55:56.960 --> 55:59.670
but there's definitely
an element of septicaemia.

55:59.720 --> 56:02.000
- I should call an ambulance.
- Yes.

56:05.320 --> 56:07.440
I think I'm rather unwell.

56:10.080 --> 56:11.590
Not to worry.

56:11.640 --> 56:14.550
The hospital will get
you fixed up in no time.

56:27.280 --> 56:30.350
How's the patient? Do you
have everything you need?

56:30.400 --> 56:33.160
Yes, thank you. I believe I do.

56:41.360 --> 56:45.030
'Some pages take longer
to turn than others.

56:45.080 --> 56:49.110
It doesn't matter if the spotless
sheet follows a blotted one,

56:49.160 --> 56:53.240
or if the preceding lines
are blurred with tears.

56:54.680 --> 56:58.350
What went before is erased,

56:58.400 --> 57:00.070
or embraced,

57:00.120 --> 57:02.280
as we begin another chapter.

57:08.360 --> 57:09.950
Tom!

57:10.000 --> 57:11.670
Am I needed somewhere?

57:11.720 --> 57:15.110
I'm afraid I have to
take you to the hospital.

57:16.200 --> 57:18.990
Do they need a chaplain
urgently? Barbara's not well.

57:19.040 --> 57:21.000
It's Barbara who needs you.

57:22.200 --> 57:25.680
- What? - Get in. We're
going straight there.

57:37.840 --> 57:40.470
She's young and strong. She's
a fighter, is our Barbara.

57:40.520 --> 57:43.470
He's being pulled in all
directions at the moment,

57:43.520 --> 57:46.150
with the clinic, his
surgery, and Wadelock House.

57:46.200 --> 57:49.350
There's a local boy in
there, same age as Tim.

57:49.400 --> 57:50.750
He troubles me.

57:50.800 --> 57:53.750
I like to pray with other people.
It's how I was brought up.

57:53.800 --> 57:55.910
I would gladly let the good Lord take me,

57:55.960 --> 57:58.040
if he would spare her.
