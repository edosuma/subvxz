WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:02.365
Previously on Grimm...

00:07.400 --> 00:08.401
You told them?

00:10.040 --> 00:11.041
Oh, my God!

00:11.120 --> 00:12.121
It's the new me.

00:14.760 --> 00:18.162
You need to kill her,
before she kills me!

00:18.240 --> 00:21.323
I like this power, Nick.
And I know you do, too...

00:21.400 --> 00:23.084
Stop it!
I can't!

00:23.160 --> 00:26.004
I'm not letting you out.
It's safer for you in here.

00:26.080 --> 00:27.241
And safer for you.

00:29.880 --> 00:33.407
"He had killed man,
the noblest game of all,

00:33.480 --> 00:36.723
and he had killed in the face
of the law of club and fang."

00:38.400 --> 00:41.961
Four tents, eight sleeping
bags, two axes, TP...

00:42.040 --> 00:43.041
I brought some firewood.

00:43.120 --> 00:44.840
No, you didn't. We collect
our own firewood.

00:44.880 --> 00:48.362
And now, it is time to give
me all cell phones, iPads...

00:48.440 --> 00:51.011
Anything that plugs
in goes into this bin.

00:51.080 --> 00:53.765
Come on, guys.
Disconnect, give 'em up.

00:53.840 --> 00:54.887
Nice try, Elliott.

00:54.960 --> 00:58.851
Water, first-aid kit, check, check, check.
You boys are ready to go.

00:58.920 --> 01:01.491
All right, let's load up.

01:08.600 --> 01:10.489
Say goodbye to civilization.

01:18.000 --> 01:19.843
Bye, Maggie.
Bye, Dad.

01:19.920 --> 01:21.081
See you, sis.

01:21.160 --> 01:22.161
See ya.

01:26.360 --> 01:30.081
If Juliette is going to bars and
beating people up and going to jail?

01:30.160 --> 01:31.320
Are you gonna leave her there?

01:31.360 --> 01:33.362
If I get her out,
she could kill somebody.

01:33.440 --> 01:36.683
Did she say anything
along the lines of, like,

01:36.760 --> 01:40.606
"Sorry, I didn't mean to beat
up folks I never met before"?

01:40.680 --> 01:42.409
No. She said she's having fun.

01:42.840 --> 01:45.411
Oh, Nick, this is
not looking good.

01:45.520 --> 01:47.520
You guys haven't found
anything that can stop this?

01:47.560 --> 01:51.929
This is a unique,
like, once-in-a-lifetime,

01:52.000 --> 01:55.447
doesn't-ever-seem-to-have-happened-before
kind of event, conundrum.

01:55.520 --> 01:57.045
We haven't found
anything that works,

01:57.120 --> 01:58.690
and we've looked
through everything.

01:58.760 --> 02:00.444
We're not giving up.

02:00.520 --> 02:03.922
It's just... I mean, we have
no idea where to go from here.

02:04.040 --> 02:05.041
Except Adalind.

02:06.560 --> 02:09.211
She might be the only one that
knows something about this.

02:09.280 --> 02:11.760
No. If I see her again...

02:11.840 --> 02:14.571
I really doubt she'd do anything
to help Juliette, anyway.

02:14.640 --> 02:17.610
Juliette is paying the price
for us taking Adalind's child.

02:20.680 --> 02:23.524
Come on, everyone. Circle
up, circle up, circle up!

02:24.560 --> 02:25.641
Come on.

02:27.080 --> 02:32.246
Now, I know the natural
world seems harsh to you.

02:33.720 --> 02:35.000
That's because
you don't know it.

02:35.840 --> 02:38.286
You don't know it because we've
lost touch with our past,

02:38.360 --> 02:41.762
we've lost touch with that world
and therefore with ourselves.

02:41.920 --> 02:45.891
But that's all gonna change as we
open up to reconnecting to our past,

02:45.960 --> 02:47.530
to who we really are.

02:48.400 --> 02:55.409
You boys, you have a responsibility
to embrace your true natures.

02:57.560 --> 03:00.848
So, get ready. This is not
a game, it's not playtime.

03:02.080 --> 03:03.525
Are you ready?

03:03.600 --> 03:04.931
Yeah.

03:05.000 --> 03:07.446
I said, are you ready?

03:07.600 --> 03:09.125
Yeah!

03:09.200 --> 03:10.565
To the hunt!

03:10.640 --> 03:15.043
To the hunt!
To the hunt! To the hunt!

03:32.280 --> 03:33.850
I got it!
I got it! I got it!

03:33.920 --> 03:35.160
I got it! I got it!
Yes, son!

03:35.240 --> 03:36.480
You got it, son.
Hold on. Hold on.

03:36.560 --> 03:38.324
Hold it high, Elliott, be proud.

03:38.400 --> 03:40.129
I got it.

03:41.080 --> 03:42.969
As our
ancestors once lived,

03:43.040 --> 03:47.887
you boys are about to discover what
it is to be a man, to be Wesen.

03:49.080 --> 03:50.491
But it is not easy.

03:51.640 --> 03:58.091
Whether you are Lowen,
Blutbad, Drang-Zorn or Balam,

03:58.160 --> 03:59.764
we are all blessed.

04:00.920 --> 04:03.161
And when you Woge
for the first time

04:03.240 --> 04:06.289
you will feel a power like
you have never felt before.

04:07.800 --> 04:10.406
But this is
never to be revealed.

04:10.520 --> 04:11.760
Normal people will never feel

04:11.840 --> 04:14.002
what you feel, they will
never know what you know,

04:14.160 --> 04:17.084
they will never live
life as deeply as you.

04:17.680 --> 04:19.523
Do not be afraid
of what you are.

04:21.360 --> 04:25.604
It's your history, be proud.

04:25.840 --> 04:29.526
And now, we feast from the hunt.

06:11.280 --> 06:13.009
Hey! Come on!

06:13.560 --> 06:15.562
I ain't gonna hurt you!

06:15.640 --> 06:17.005
You can still pull over!

06:46.480 --> 06:48.528
Rosalee, it's so
nice of you to pop by.

06:48.600 --> 06:50.921
Juliette, I just...

06:51.000 --> 06:52.729
I wanted you to know
how sorry I am

06:52.800 --> 06:54.723
for everything that's going on.

06:54.800 --> 06:57.371
I feel partially responsible.

06:57.440 --> 06:58.965
You are, but I don't blame you.

06:59.040 --> 07:00.530
In fact, I think
I should thank you.

07:00.680 --> 07:03.843
No, look, Juliette,
this isn't you.

07:03.920 --> 07:07.208
It wasn't me,
but it sure is now.

07:07.760 --> 07:10.331
What happened, did Nick come over
and do a big boo-hoo with you?

07:11.360 --> 07:12.441
He loves you.

07:12.520 --> 07:14.648
That's really nice, Rosalee,
but can the love stuff.

07:14.720 --> 07:18.850
I mean, life is so much
more interesting now.

07:18.920 --> 07:21.605
I mean, would you give up
being a Fuchsbau if you could?

07:22.760 --> 07:24.046
I, uh...

07:24.520 --> 07:26.966
I would, if it was the only
way I could be with Monroe.

07:27.040 --> 07:28.644
And would he do
the same for you?

07:29.680 --> 07:31.011
I believe he would.

07:31.080 --> 07:33.811
Well, Nick wouldn't give it up for me.
He had the chance.

07:33.880 --> 07:35.530
You can't blame Nick for that.

07:35.640 --> 07:38.644
We needed him back because of the
threats against us, and you agreed.

07:38.720 --> 07:43.282
No, no, I'm not complaining. Like,
everything just worked out for the best.

07:43.440 --> 07:44.965
You got your husband back,

07:45.040 --> 07:47.964
Nick is a Grimm again,
and I am on top of the world.

07:48.040 --> 07:51.328
No, no, you're angry and you're
bitter and I don't blame you.

07:51.400 --> 07:55.291
I mean, nobody does.
We're your friends, though.

07:55.400 --> 07:57.323
Juliette, I'm your friend,
and I know you,

07:57.400 --> 07:59.050
and I know you're
still in love with Nick.

08:00.080 --> 08:01.570
Thanks for stopping by.

08:04.000 --> 08:05.081
Juliette!

08:11.040 --> 08:13.327
Victim appears to have been
hitchhiking when he was attacked.

08:13.400 --> 08:15.482
Assumption is he was hit
where he dropped the sign,

08:15.560 --> 08:17.528
seeing that he was probably
fighting for his life

08:17.640 --> 08:19.324
as he was dragged
into the bushes

08:19.400 --> 08:21.687
and not thinking
about getting to Salem.

08:21.760 --> 08:23.091
Who found the body?

08:23.160 --> 08:25.208
A jogger with his dog
about 6:00 this morning.

08:25.280 --> 08:28.090
Credit goes to the dog, who
probably smelled the blood.

08:28.720 --> 08:32.441
Looks like an animal attack,
which it probably wasn't.

08:33.880 --> 08:38.966
Ah, few dollars in his wallet,
belonging to Gary Groff.

08:39.080 --> 08:40.570
Expired Illinois license.

08:40.640 --> 08:42.130
There's some kind of print.

08:42.919 --> 08:43.967
Do you recognize it?

08:44.039 --> 08:46.611
Not really.

08:46.680 --> 08:48.444
But that has got to be Wesen.

08:48.520 --> 08:50.363
Should we track it?
Seriously?

08:50.440 --> 08:53.444
No, I was just waiting for you
to say, "We need Monroe."

08:54.880 --> 08:56.405
We need Monroe.

09:00.960 --> 09:02.724
Captain.

09:02.800 --> 09:04.370
Captain!
Yeah.

09:04.480 --> 09:07.404
Got last night's crime report
you asked for. Busy night.

09:07.880 --> 09:11.248
GTAs, domestic, D and D's,
urinating in public.

09:11.400 --> 09:13.402
Any assaults? Yeah,
plenty of those.

09:13.480 --> 09:14.561
Aggravated?

09:14.640 --> 09:17.450
Uh, there were two in ours
and one in the southeast.

09:19.600 --> 09:21.967
Something specific
you're looking for?

09:22.080 --> 09:24.321
I might have seen something.

09:24.400 --> 09:25.890
Yeah, I was near this one.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.001
Check with the victim,
see if there's any

09:27.080 --> 09:28.081
suspect description.

09:28.160 --> 09:29.491
Yeah, will do.

09:33.080 --> 09:34.764
Honestly.

09:35.560 --> 09:38.040
How can Juliette
be okay with this?

09:38.120 --> 09:41.841
Because we keep thinking she's
the same as she was, and she's not.

09:41.920 --> 09:43.968
I mean, what are you
gonna tell Nick?

09:44.040 --> 09:45.246
He's on his way over here.

09:45.320 --> 09:46.600
I think we should
stay out of it.

09:47.080 --> 09:48.241
She needs to realize
she loves him,

09:48.320 --> 09:49.446
we can't tell her to.

09:49.560 --> 09:51.847
Has she completely
forgotten all the good?

09:51.960 --> 09:53.405
I mean, how much they love...

09:54.600 --> 09:56.364
Hey.
Hey, guys.

09:56.440 --> 09:57.441
You got that photo?

09:57.520 --> 09:58.851
Yeah, right here.

10:01.840 --> 10:03.968
Oh, that looks Lowen,
more than likely.

10:05.040 --> 10:06.530
Not Fuchsbau.

10:06.600 --> 10:07.601
Could be Blutbaden.

10:07.680 --> 10:10.081
I'm sorry?
With those toes?

10:10.160 --> 10:11.844
Yeah, well, definitely Wesen.

10:12.200 --> 10:13.804
What was the condition
of the victim?

10:13.880 --> 10:15.291
Sort of a midnight snack.

10:15.360 --> 10:16.521
Oh, that's not good.

10:16.600 --> 10:18.090
You guys want me to go
out there and have a...

10:18.160 --> 10:19.286
Yes.
Yes.

10:24.200 --> 10:25.281
I will. Thank you.

10:26.560 --> 10:28.120
Got the details
on that assault.

10:28.160 --> 10:29.969
Victim's name is James Waddell.

10:30.040 --> 10:31.451
He was attacked at
2:45 a.m. right next to

10:31.520 --> 10:32.806
the Skidmore Fountain,

10:35.040 --> 10:39.011
on his way home from a late
shift at Olympia Provisions.

10:39.080 --> 10:40.081
No witnesses.

10:40.200 --> 10:41.326
He was semiconscious
at the scene,

10:41.400 --> 10:44.085
but couldn't provide a
description of his attacker.

10:44.560 --> 10:46.801
He's at St. Joe's. You
want me to check on him?

10:46.880 --> 10:48.769
No, thanks.
That's all.

10:52.320 --> 10:54.846
Damerov is no longer
in our employ.

10:54.920 --> 10:57.002
Sean and I came
to an understanding.

10:58.600 --> 10:59.840
I made it very clear

10:59.920 --> 11:03.129
that any more interference on your
son's part would be his last.

11:03.200 --> 11:04.326
Who are you talking to?

11:05.080 --> 11:07.765
The King. You have something
you'd like to say to him?

11:10.600 --> 11:12.250
No, sir.

11:12.320 --> 11:14.448
Sean is well aware
this comes from you.

11:16.920 --> 11:18.081
Thank you.

11:20.280 --> 11:23.011
Is the King going to kill Sean?

11:23.080 --> 11:27.608
Considering he's the father of one of
your children, does that upset you?

11:27.680 --> 11:30.047
Does anyone actually
care what I think?

11:30.120 --> 11:31.360
No.

11:31.440 --> 11:34.603
But I do have some information
you might find interesting.

11:36.120 --> 11:39.602
I just found out your little
Hexenbiest chum, Juliette,

11:39.680 --> 11:41.284
has gotten herself arrested.

11:41.360 --> 11:42.361
She's in jail?

11:42.440 --> 11:45.330
She throttled a couple
of people at a bar.

11:45.400 --> 11:47.289
Apparently, they
didn't have it coming.

11:47.640 --> 11:50.120
If that happened, that means
she's starting to accept

11:50.200 --> 11:52.123
becoming a Hexenbiest.

11:52.200 --> 11:55.647
And things are gonna get worse
before they get really bad.

11:55.720 --> 11:57.449
Including her desire
to kill you?

11:58.040 --> 11:59.166
Yes.

11:59.520 --> 12:01.801
Then this could be the opportunity
we've been waiting for.

12:01.960 --> 12:05.567
I'm sorry, but I don't see an
opportunity anywhere near her.

12:05.640 --> 12:09.326
Juliette knows just about
everything about Mr. Burkhardt,

12:09.440 --> 12:12.284
about his mother, and therefore

12:12.360 --> 12:15.250
about where the child,
your child, might be.

12:15.320 --> 12:17.926
Okay, she may have beat up
a couple people in a bar,

12:18.000 --> 12:19.206
I mean, God knows
we've all done that,

12:19.320 --> 12:21.641
but there is no way she's
going to betray Nick,

12:21.760 --> 12:22.921
if that's where you're going.

12:23.000 --> 12:26.925
It's surprising how quickly
betrayal becomes a viable option,

12:27.000 --> 12:29.128
given the right circumstances.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.526
Which right circumstances?

12:34.600 --> 12:36.170
By the way,

12:37.160 --> 12:41.722
have you made up your mind about
who the father of that one is?

12:44.680 --> 12:48.127
Don't strain yourself.
I know it's Mr. Burkhardt.

12:48.320 --> 12:49.320
What?

12:49.360 --> 12:51.203
Appropriate indignation.

12:51.840 --> 12:53.444
But the real question is,

12:53.520 --> 12:55.602
what will Juliette do
when she finds out

12:55.680 --> 12:57.682
that you and Nick are
having a love child?

12:58.840 --> 12:59.921
You wouldn't.

13:00.000 --> 13:01.809
Given the right circumstances.

13:01.920 --> 13:04.002
I am the mother of
the child you want!

13:04.080 --> 13:06.970
It's surprising how quickly
betrayal becomes a viable option.

13:07.040 --> 13:08.326
Cheerio.

13:15.280 --> 13:17.567
You say the body was
partially consumed?

13:17.640 --> 13:18.721
That's what it looked like.

13:18.840 --> 13:21.127
Or the animals could have
fed after he died. Mmm.

13:21.200 --> 13:22.565
I don't think so.

13:24.080 --> 13:25.366
This feels more like a hunt.

13:25.440 --> 13:26.805
A hunt?

13:26.880 --> 13:28.689
Not all of us are
reformed, you know.

13:30.520 --> 13:31.646
Yeah, look at this.

13:34.280 --> 13:37.648
No shoes, stripped down,
you know, going old school.

13:39.120 --> 13:41.964
Yeah, my guess is this
is some badass dude.

13:43.760 --> 13:48.322
There's not much scent left, but he
might have taken a piece with him.

13:49.840 --> 13:51.888
Maybe we can
track the blood trail.

13:54.320 --> 13:55.845
It's private property.

13:55.920 --> 13:58.810
Wire's bent up like
somebody went through here.

14:04.080 --> 14:06.162
We should see who owns this.

14:06.280 --> 14:08.726
If the killer got through,
they could be in danger.

14:08.920 --> 14:10.081
Or involved.

14:14.440 --> 14:16.363
Wow, I've actually
heard of this place.

14:16.440 --> 14:18.522
It's like a coming-of-age
camp for boys.

14:18.600 --> 14:19.965
Like a Boy Scout camp?

14:20.040 --> 14:21.451
Sort of, yeah.
It's word of mouth.

14:21.520 --> 14:23.170
It's kind of
an underground thing.

14:23.240 --> 14:25.811
It's like a Wesen Men's
Movement deal, you know?

14:25.880 --> 14:27.370
Like that poet, Robert Bly.

14:27.440 --> 14:28.885
Except getting in touch
with your wild side

14:28.960 --> 14:30.530
has a whole different
meaning for Wesen.

14:30.640 --> 14:32.210
I actually went to one
when I was a kid,

14:32.280 --> 14:33.805
then they sort of
died out for a while.

14:33.880 --> 14:34.961
I heard they were
making a comeback.

14:35.120 --> 14:36.281
Can I help you?

14:37.160 --> 14:38.969
Yeah,
I'm Detective Burkhardt.

14:39.640 --> 14:42.291
This is Detective
Griffin and Monroe.

14:43.600 --> 14:45.409
- You the owner of this property?
- I am.

14:45.480 --> 14:48.802
Albert Bowden. This is my son, Todd.
Is there a problem?

14:48.920 --> 14:50.843
We're investigating an attack.

14:50.920 --> 14:53.287
Happened down on the
highway, a man was killed.

14:53.760 --> 14:55.040
Then, what are you
doing up here?

14:55.360 --> 14:57.806
There's a possibility the suspect
crossed through your property.

14:57.880 --> 14:58.881
How would you know that?

14:59.000 --> 15:00.411
We followed the tracks
up to your fence.

15:00.480 --> 15:01.686
You don't look like trackers.

15:07.000 --> 15:08.001
Hey, take it easy.

15:12.840 --> 15:14.285
I've heard about you.

15:14.360 --> 15:16.408
I am not afraid of any Grimm.
Todd!

15:16.480 --> 15:17.766
We're here on an investigation.

15:17.840 --> 15:19.080
We need to ask you
a few questions.

15:19.160 --> 15:20.924
Is that going to be a problem?

15:21.000 --> 15:22.081
Is everything all right?

15:22.160 --> 15:24.561
He's that Grimm
that we heard about.

15:24.680 --> 15:25.920
Wow.

15:26.000 --> 15:27.968
So, this is what
a Grimm looks like.

15:28.040 --> 15:29.644
This is
my daughter Maggie.

15:29.720 --> 15:31.006
What do you need from us?

15:31.680 --> 15:33.569
We just need to know where
everyone was last night.

15:33.640 --> 15:36.928
Right here. All of us.

15:37.040 --> 15:38.804
You say you've heard
of these camps before.

15:38.880 --> 15:42.851
Yeah, I went to an Iron Hans camp
with my dad when I was a kid.

15:42.960 --> 15:44.485
It was great.

15:44.560 --> 15:45.925
Didn't know they
were still doing them.

15:46.000 --> 15:47.650
So, you've accepted who you are.

15:48.000 --> 15:49.206
You could say that.

15:49.680 --> 15:52.286
Well, a lot of Blutbaden can't.

15:53.800 --> 15:55.211
Yeah, it's not always easy.

15:55.520 --> 15:56.760
What did you say your name was?

15:57.040 --> 15:58.201
Monroe.

15:59.160 --> 16:00.400
I've heard of you, too.

16:04.240 --> 16:05.765
Anyone else here last night?

16:05.840 --> 16:10.129
We host two camps most weekends,
one Friday, another Saturday.

16:10.200 --> 16:12.567
Last night we had three
fathers and their sons here.

16:13.000 --> 16:14.001
You were with them all night?

16:14.080 --> 16:17.846
Yeah, that's the point, we were
camping out. Except for Maggie.

16:17.920 --> 16:21.606
Boys only. I was here.
It was nail night.

16:21.680 --> 16:23.364
Maggie.

16:24.160 --> 16:25.207
How far is the camp?

16:25.280 --> 16:26.441
Just a few miles in.

16:26.520 --> 16:27.760
We'd like to take a look at it.

16:28.640 --> 16:30.165
Certainly.

16:30.240 --> 16:31.480
We can take the van.

16:45.600 --> 16:47.443
It's a pleasure to meet you.
You, too.

16:50.640 --> 16:52.244
Well, you seem
to have the touch.

16:52.320 --> 16:53.810
Ooh! Ow!

16:53.880 --> 16:55.564
Hey! I'm so sorry, are you okay?

17:03.600 --> 17:06.523
Time to go.

17:06.599 --> 17:07.681
Where?

17:07.760 --> 17:09.523
Bail's been paid.

17:09.599 --> 17:11.682
By whom?

17:11.800 --> 17:13.006
Not my job.

17:13.079 --> 17:14.809
We like to get them
up here around noon,

17:14.880 --> 17:16.530
let them get settled into camp.

17:16.599 --> 17:18.204
You have to understand that

17:18.280 --> 17:19.441
for most of these
fathers and sons,

17:19.520 --> 17:20.964
it's their first time
out in the woods.

17:21.040 --> 17:22.848
They don't even know what it's
like not to sleep in a bed.

17:22.920 --> 17:24.604
Or have a bathroom.

17:24.680 --> 17:26.603
And the boys haven't Woged yet.

17:26.680 --> 17:29.081
And as you well know,
that can be quite emotional,

17:29.160 --> 17:30.491
for them and for their fathers.

17:30.560 --> 17:32.562
We're gonna need the name of
everyone who was here last night.

17:32.640 --> 17:33.880
Sure, Maggie can
get those for you.

17:33.960 --> 17:36.725
So you're a Blutbad and
you hang with a Grimm?

17:36.840 --> 17:37.887
I do.

17:38.160 --> 17:39.924
You don't have a problem with that?
I don't.

17:40.000 --> 17:42.480
And I'm not interested
in your opinion if you do.

17:45.320 --> 17:46.651
Looks like we got some blood.

17:48.320 --> 17:49.685
It is.

17:49.760 --> 17:51.410
Without the blood, you
miss the whole purpose.

17:51.480 --> 17:52.561
And who does it belong to?

17:54.560 --> 17:57.484
We went on a hunt.
And we did kill something.

17:57.560 --> 17:58.766
A rabbit.

17:58.840 --> 18:02.401
We gutted it right there, we cooked
it right here over the fire,

18:02.480 --> 18:03.606
and we shared its flesh.

18:03.680 --> 18:05.011
Nothing illegal in that.

18:05.080 --> 18:07.162
We don't go after
what our ancestors did.

18:07.680 --> 18:09.728
The days of that kind
of hunt are long gone,

18:09.880 --> 18:11.644
even if you
fantasize they're not.

18:13.480 --> 18:16.529
You've been on
a hunt before, I can tell.

18:17.760 --> 18:20.411
You know the struggle and
you've made peace with it,

18:20.480 --> 18:22.448
and now you work with a Grimm.

18:22.520 --> 18:24.284
Fascinating.

18:24.360 --> 18:26.044
I'd like to hear about
how that happened.

18:27.400 --> 18:28.447
Long story.

18:28.520 --> 18:30.443
Well, maybe you can tell it tonight.
I have a new group.

18:30.520 --> 18:32.727
Oh.
No, I don't think so.

18:33.080 --> 18:35.367
It would be an honor to
have someone like yourself,

18:35.440 --> 18:37.124
someone who's lived it,

18:37.200 --> 18:38.201
talk to us.

18:38.640 --> 18:40.847
You could give a little back,

18:40.920 --> 18:43.526
you could change the lives
of some of these young boys.

18:52.840 --> 18:53.841
Juliette?

18:55.680 --> 18:57.523
My name's Kenneth,
we've never met.

18:58.040 --> 19:00.566
You bailed me out.
Why?

19:01.040 --> 19:02.326
We have something in common.

19:02.400 --> 19:03.526
Am I supposed to ask what?

19:03.600 --> 19:05.602
You're not curious?
No.

19:05.720 --> 19:09.042
He can't be much of a boyfriend
if he left you to rot in jail.

19:10.280 --> 19:14.080
Seems like we both have good
reason to be upset, the Grimm.

19:14.400 --> 19:15.401
What do you want?

19:15.480 --> 19:19.280
What we've always wanted,
Adalind's child.

19:19.360 --> 19:21.169
No surprise there, I suppose.

19:21.600 --> 19:22.761
You're one of the Royals.

19:22.840 --> 19:23.921
Yes.

19:24.480 --> 19:26.403
The one who is going
to get the child back.

19:27.040 --> 19:28.371
Well, I don't know where she is.

19:28.440 --> 19:31.330
I believe that you don't, but I
also believe that you could.

19:31.720 --> 19:33.484
Sorry you wasted
your bail money.

19:33.920 --> 19:37.049
My God, you're still
loyal to the Grimm.

19:37.120 --> 19:38.929
Even after what
he's done to you.

19:39.440 --> 19:41.966
You know, I admire loyalty
when it's deserved,

19:42.040 --> 19:44.566
but this borders on tragic.

19:44.680 --> 19:47.160
You know,
it might be more tragic

19:47.240 --> 19:49.242
for a Royal to die in Portland.

19:49.640 --> 19:53.201
For me,
yes, of course.

19:53.280 --> 19:55.169
But I thought for sure
you would be interested

19:55.240 --> 19:57.561
to know
that Adalind is pregnant.

19:57.640 --> 19:58.641
Again.

19:59.240 --> 20:01.129
And that is a surprise, why?

20:01.200 --> 20:02.725
Think about it.

20:02.800 --> 20:04.529
Nick assumed he was
sleeping with you,

20:04.640 --> 20:07.007
so you can't really blame him
for cheating with Adalind.

20:07.320 --> 20:10.164
Still, you have to
appreciate the irony.

20:10.240 --> 20:12.447
She's having what should
have been your baby,

20:12.520 --> 20:14.170
with your boyfriend.

20:14.760 --> 20:16.000
No, you're wrong.

20:16.080 --> 20:17.241
I'm not.

20:17.360 --> 20:19.761
And the sooner you decide
to help me get what I want,

20:19.840 --> 20:22.047
the sooner I can make
your life a lot better.

20:24.480 --> 20:27.882
When you're ready,
I'll be at the Hotel deluxe.

20:27.960 --> 20:31.169
Otherwise, I'll see if I can get
you an invite to the baby shower.

20:34.520 --> 20:35.760
What time did everyone turn in?

20:36.160 --> 20:37.730
I guess it was about 11:00.

20:38.320 --> 20:41.847
We stayed up for a while, looking
at the stars and talking.

20:44.000 --> 20:45.570
Did you hear anything
after you went to bed?

20:45.680 --> 20:48.160
No, I passed out as soon
as we were in the tent.

20:48.240 --> 20:50.641
I didn't wake up till morning,
probably about 6:30.

20:50.760 --> 20:52.649
Everyone was there in the morning?
Yeah.

20:53.000 --> 20:54.126
Tell us about the hunt.

20:54.800 --> 20:57.201
Well, it was pretty
primitive, you know.

20:57.280 --> 20:59.044
I mean, I don't know
how else to describe

20:59.120 --> 21:01.521
chasing down a rabbit
with our bare hands,

21:01.600 --> 21:02.965
you know?

21:09.000 --> 21:10.843
I have to talk to Nick.

21:12.760 --> 21:13.886
In my humble opinion,

21:14.000 --> 21:17.288
you should get the hell out
of here before Nick sees you.

21:17.360 --> 21:19.408
I have something to tell him.

21:20.040 --> 21:21.720
And what makes you think
Nick is interested

21:21.800 --> 21:23.848
in anything you might have to...

21:27.640 --> 21:28.687
That is not mine.

21:29.440 --> 21:32.410
Of course it's not yours. Don't you
think I know who I've slept with?

21:32.960 --> 21:34.928
Yeah, well, who haven't you slept with?
Let's start there.

21:35.000 --> 21:37.241
I know who the father is.

21:37.320 --> 21:40.369
It happened when he thought
he was sleeping with Juliette.

21:40.440 --> 21:41.441
What?

21:41.520 --> 21:44.808
The child is Nick's. I haven't
been with anybody else.

21:44.880 --> 21:46.689
So where the hell is he?

21:48.640 --> 21:50.768
Watching those boys
chase that jackrabbit,

21:50.840 --> 21:55.562
I mean, we were all connected, it was
so primal, it was awesome!

21:56.960 --> 21:58.007
Uh...

21:58.080 --> 22:01.766
Look, I know this is serious,
but I didn't see anything.

22:04.680 --> 22:07.524
Thanks for your time. We got
everything we need. You can go.

22:07.600 --> 22:10.331
If we have any further
questions, we'll let you know.

22:11.240 --> 22:12.880
Could it be any of them?
I don't think so.

22:13.080 --> 22:14.730
I mean, I can't be certain.

22:14.800 --> 22:17.167
They've all gone home and
showered, so, you know,

22:17.240 --> 22:19.049
they all reek of deodorant
and after-shave.

22:19.120 --> 22:22.203
But I'm not getting any killer
instinct from these guys at all.

22:22.280 --> 22:23.964
Well, then it's gotta
be Hans or Todd.

22:27.400 --> 22:30.404
What if you went back
out there tonight?

22:30.480 --> 22:32.687
I mean, they said they wanted
you to talk to the boys.

22:32.760 --> 22:35.081
You might pick up on something.

22:37.760 --> 22:38.807
I could do that.

22:40.720 --> 22:41.767
Nick.

22:42.400 --> 22:44.562
Can I see you in
my office, please?

22:54.160 --> 22:55.889
ls there a problem?

23:00.920 --> 23:02.285
What the hell is she doing here?

23:02.400 --> 23:03.765
Ask her.

23:03.840 --> 23:05.683
I'm not asking her anything.

23:05.760 --> 23:07.489
I'm done with her.
She ruined Juliette's life.

23:07.560 --> 23:08.891
I didn't know that would happen.

23:08.960 --> 23:10.803
Wait, Nick...
What?

23:17.800 --> 23:19.564
Again?

23:19.640 --> 23:20.801
That's not mine.

23:22.000 --> 23:23.365
It's yours!

23:23.440 --> 23:25.966
Are you crazy?
That's impossible.

23:26.240 --> 23:28.846
Impossible? Don't I wish.

23:30.960 --> 23:34.806
Remember that wild
afternoon with "Juliette"

23:34.880 --> 23:36.928
before Monroe and
Rosalee's wedding?

23:39.320 --> 23:41.687
This is not something
that I wanted, either.

23:42.840 --> 23:44.001
I'm pregnant, Nick.

23:44.120 --> 23:46.202
Look, I had no idea.
Believe me.

23:47.360 --> 23:49.488
And it doesn't look like
she's making it up either.

23:49.560 --> 23:53.042
I've already had one child taken
from me, I'm not losing another.

23:53.160 --> 23:55.447
Even he wouldn't protect
his child last time.

23:55.520 --> 23:57.443
I did what I thought
was best for Diana.

23:57.520 --> 24:00.569
Yeah, well, it's a
room full of heroes.

24:00.680 --> 24:02.205
Well, now, I need one.

24:04.080 --> 24:05.923
I need you, Nick.

24:06.360 --> 24:07.361
What do you want from me?

24:08.040 --> 24:10.520
I need you to protect
me from Juliette.

24:12.040 --> 24:13.451
'Cause nobody else will.

24:13.520 --> 24:14.806
Why the hell would I do that?

24:14.880 --> 24:17.008
I'm not expecting you
to do this for me,

24:17.480 --> 24:20.848
I was hoping that you would
do it for your child.

24:21.200 --> 24:26.445
But, if not for that, maybe
you'll do it for Juliette.

24:26.520 --> 24:28.682
For Juliette?
Are you kidding me?

24:28.760 --> 24:30.091
I know a way to help her.

24:30.160 --> 24:31.685
I don't believe
anything you're saying.

24:31.760 --> 24:34.411
Do you think I would risk coming
here if I didn't have anything?

24:34.920 --> 24:37.651
Look, I'm not making
any promises,

24:37.720 --> 24:40.451
and you have to understand that there
is no way to cure her completely.

24:40.520 --> 24:41.567
Well, then what's
the point of this?

24:41.640 --> 24:45.042
Because there is a way to
suppress the Hexenbiest in her.

24:45.120 --> 24:47.600
But she'll still be one. So what
good does suppressing it do?

24:47.680 --> 24:49.603
Well, a lot, if it works.

24:49.680 --> 24:52.160
If it works?

24:52.240 --> 24:54.481
Yeah, I've heard that before. What
kind of side effects this time?

24:54.560 --> 24:56.050
This isn't about changing her,

24:56.120 --> 25:00.444
this is so that she can live a normal,
if that's what you want, life.

25:00.560 --> 25:02.050
We've been through
the book that you used.

25:02.120 --> 25:03.610
There's nothing
about what you're saying.

25:03.680 --> 25:05.444
It's not in the book,
specifically.

25:05.760 --> 25:07.410
My mother's aunt
told me about this

25:07.480 --> 25:10.006
when my mother was going
through a very tough time.

25:10.080 --> 25:12.731
She didn't end up doing it,
but there is a way.

25:12.800 --> 25:15.531
It's not easy, and there is

25:15.600 --> 25:18.206
one ingredient that's
almost impossible to get.

25:18.760 --> 25:19.760
What is it?

25:19.800 --> 25:21.086
A dead Hexenbiest.

25:21.160 --> 25:22.810
That shouldn't be
too hard to get.

25:22.880 --> 25:25.486
Not me. it can't be fresh.

25:26.280 --> 25:28.681
Besides, if anything
happens to me,

25:28.760 --> 25:31.206
you'll be stuck with Juliette
the way she is forever.

25:31.280 --> 25:34.841
Now, if you're good
with that, then fine.

25:34.920 --> 25:38.402
But it just so
happens that I know

25:38.480 --> 25:41.006
where a dead
Hexenbiest is buried.

25:41.080 --> 25:42.491
That would be my mother.

25:43.440 --> 25:46.205
Your mother killed
her, remember?

25:46.280 --> 25:47.645
And you slept with her.

25:48.320 --> 25:51.210
Right, well, as long as
we're digging up the past,

25:51.320 --> 25:52.810
we may as well
dig up your mother.

25:53.760 --> 25:54.841
What else do you need?

25:54.920 --> 25:56.126
Rosalee's help.

25:56.480 --> 26:00.166
And I need you to convince her,
'cause I can't do that alone.

26:05.720 --> 26:06.960
He's kicking.

26:08.160 --> 26:10.049
Wow. A lot.

26:11.120 --> 26:12.485
It's a boy.

26:13.160 --> 26:15.003
I wanted to know.

26:17.920 --> 26:20.321
He's still kicking.

26:20.400 --> 26:22.129
You should feel this, Nick.

26:27.720 --> 26:28.926
He's yours.

26:29.840 --> 26:33.686
Whether you accept this child
or not, that'll never change.

26:38.800 --> 26:41.929
You all act like I'm
responsible for everything.

26:42.000 --> 26:44.606
But I only did what I did to you

26:44.680 --> 26:47.411
because you took
my child from me.

26:49.840 --> 26:51.569
He's strong,

26:52.720 --> 26:54.085
like you.

27:29.160 --> 27:31.242
I'm going to have
our baby, Nick.

27:34.480 --> 27:36.926
There's only one person
who can stop me.

27:44.080 --> 27:46.208
I'll take you to Rosalee.

27:46.280 --> 27:48.282
But I don't know if she'll help.

27:49.000 --> 27:51.526
I honestly don't think this
could get any more complicated.

27:55.360 --> 27:57.169
This was a big shock to me, too.

27:57.240 --> 27:59.720
It never even occurred to me that
something like this could...

27:59.800 --> 28:01.245
It happened.

28:09.800 --> 28:10.926
Juliette.

28:11.960 --> 28:13.530
So, it's true.

28:14.520 --> 28:16.329
You really are
gonna have a baby.

28:18.800 --> 28:20.290
Well, congratulations.

28:25.280 --> 28:28.648
I should have finished you off
when I had the chance.

28:37.200 --> 28:38.611
Keep her away from me, Nick.

28:39.080 --> 28:40.809
Don't you two
make a cute couple?

28:40.880 --> 28:42.120
Juliette, you know
how this happened.

28:42.240 --> 28:43.241
I sure do.

28:43.480 --> 28:45.562
Adalind told me it was
a real whopper.

28:45.680 --> 28:46.727
Juliette,
listen to me.

28:46.800 --> 28:49.121
I came here because I have
a way of helping you.

28:49.200 --> 28:50.770
I've had enough of your help.

28:50.840 --> 28:51.960
Nothing's gonna happen here.

28:52.280 --> 28:54.647
I'm sorry, Juliette,
but you have to leave.

28:54.720 --> 28:56.484
Really, Nick, that's
what I have to do?

28:57.160 --> 28:58.600
Let me tell you
what I'm going to do.

28:58.840 --> 29:01.161
I'm going to rip this
little bitch's throat out.

29:01.560 --> 29:03.400
You are in a police station.
Lam in hell, Nick.

29:03.480 --> 29:05.482
And it is time she
went there with me.

29:05.560 --> 29:09.246
No matter what you think about
her, the child is innocent.

29:09.320 --> 29:11.322
- You mean your child?
- Juliette!

29:11.520 --> 29:12.931
No child of hers is innocent!

29:13.080 --> 29:14.161
Don't.

29:18.400 --> 29:19.686
You're choosing her over me.

29:19.760 --> 29:20.886
That is not what I'm doing!

29:20.960 --> 29:22.530
Then get out of my way.

29:23.320 --> 29:27.530
Hey, everything okay here, Nick?

29:28.520 --> 29:31.569
Yeah, we're just
working something out.

29:31.640 --> 29:33.483
We're not working anything out.

29:33.560 --> 29:34.561
She needs to leave.

29:34.640 --> 29:37.405
She's right.
I do need to leave.

29:40.920 --> 29:42.570
We'll catch up later.

29:52.080 --> 29:54.287
So how long has
your dad been doing this?

29:54.360 --> 29:56.931
About 10 years,
since I was 20.

29:57.000 --> 29:58.968
That's when my mom died.

29:59.040 --> 30:00.485
He had a rough time with that.

30:00.560 --> 30:02.562
He needed something
to help get him through.

30:02.640 --> 30:05.484
He remembered doing these
camps as a kid, so...

30:07.840 --> 30:09.524
You've really done
it, haven't you?

30:09.600 --> 30:11.682
What are you talking about?

30:11.760 --> 30:13.205
Hunted.

30:16.080 --> 30:18.003
That was a long time ago.

30:23.880 --> 30:26.247
Yeah, I could tell
you were legit.

30:28.680 --> 30:31.001
It's a real good thing,
you talking to those boys.

30:35.080 --> 30:36.080
Hey, Nick.

30:36.120 --> 30:37.246
Hey, Rosalee.

30:37.480 --> 30:38.686
Oh, my God.

30:38.760 --> 30:39.761
That won't be the last.

30:39.840 --> 30:43.003
I thought you never wanted...
Oh, my God! Again?

30:43.080 --> 30:44.844
Nice to see you, too, Rosalee.

30:44.920 --> 30:46.570
Who's the sperm donor this time?

30:47.240 --> 30:48.571
It happened when
she was Juliette.

30:48.920 --> 30:51.651
I think I might explode.

30:51.760 --> 30:53.683
Does Juliette know?
Yes.

30:54.240 --> 30:55.685
Well, you have
a surprise coming.

30:55.760 --> 30:57.524
She's a Hexenbiest, I know.

30:57.600 --> 31:00.524
Look, lam well
aware of your help

31:00.600 --> 31:03.649
in kidnapping Diana,
so nobody's perfect.

31:03.720 --> 31:05.609
Look, if Adalind knows
how to help Juliette,

31:05.680 --> 31:08.001
then we have to help her do it.

31:08.080 --> 31:09.491
Or at least I have
to help do it.

31:09.560 --> 31:12.166
Or you may just never
want to see me again.

31:12.280 --> 31:14.328
That's
my mother's book.

31:14.840 --> 31:16.604
Do you have the hat?
Yes.

31:16.680 --> 31:17.880
Then all we need is my mother.

31:17.960 --> 31:19.291
I thought your mother was dead.

31:19.400 --> 31:21.084
Well, she couldn't
help if she was alive.

31:22.840 --> 31:23.887
Can you do this?

31:26.360 --> 31:30.843
If there's even the slightest
chance it will help Juliette, yes.

31:31.240 --> 31:32.321
Because I have nothing.

31:37.280 --> 31:38.361
Hank.

31:38.440 --> 31:40.363
I know this is
probably not a great time.

31:40.440 --> 31:42.329
Captain told me
why Adalind was here.

31:42.400 --> 31:44.084
You all right?

31:44.160 --> 31:45.161
Pretty far from that.

31:45.280 --> 31:48.250
Yeah, well, another body was
found off the same highway,

31:48.320 --> 31:50.607
half a mile south from where
we found our first vic.

31:50.720 --> 31:52.051
I can meet you there.

31:56.480 --> 31:58.687
He actually told me
to leave her alone.

32:01.280 --> 32:03.009
After what she's done to us.

32:05.200 --> 32:07.965
Well, now that he's
going to be a father,

32:08.040 --> 32:09.929
his protective urges
have shifted.

32:14.960 --> 32:16.166
What's in it for me?

32:16.240 --> 32:17.685
A whole new life,

32:17.800 --> 32:21.441
with a family that values what
you are and what you can do.

32:21.960 --> 32:26.090
This isn't about one city or one country.
This is about everything.

32:26.440 --> 32:28.124
And not to mention
the family is very generous.

32:28.200 --> 32:30.441
You can have anything you want.

32:30.920 --> 32:34.288
So, will you be a pawn
or will you be a queen?

32:35.080 --> 32:36.969
It's up to you.

32:37.040 --> 32:38.246
What do you want me to do?

32:39.320 --> 32:42.403
Nick must have some way of
communicating with his mother, yes?

32:43.080 --> 32:44.127
Yeah.

32:46.200 --> 32:49.647
Wouldn't it be wonderful
if Nick was in mortal danger

32:49.720 --> 32:51.722
and needed Mummy's help?

32:54.360 --> 32:56.408
I do hope she's the heroic type.

32:59.000 --> 33:04.564
We're very fortunate to have a special
guest with us tonight, a Wesen man.

33:04.800 --> 33:10.443
An Erlangen Wieder Weidmann, he
has seen it and done it all.

33:11.800 --> 33:14.121
Monroe, thank you
for being here.

33:14.240 --> 33:15.241
Please.

33:18.600 --> 33:19.681
Thanks.

33:31.440 --> 33:34.523
Any idiot can Woge, okay?

33:34.600 --> 33:37.206
There is a hell of a lot more
to being Wesen than that.

33:38.320 --> 33:41.642
It's true we've been persecuted
down through the ages,

33:41.720 --> 33:44.200
but we've also done
our share of persecuting.

33:45.480 --> 33:49.041
We have tremendous power
within our bodies,

33:49.120 --> 33:51.088
and within ourselves.

33:51.160 --> 33:53.003
But what you do with that power

33:53.080 --> 33:55.606
is ultimately up to each
and every one of you.

33:56.680 --> 34:02.369
As Wesen, we all live
with a dichotomy,

34:02.440 --> 34:03.521
like a split,

34:03.600 --> 34:09.004
a conflict between two perfectly
natural but opposing instincts.

34:09.080 --> 34:10.127
Okay?

34:10.800 --> 34:13.565
One is a killer.

34:13.639 --> 34:16.643
The other very much
respects life.

34:16.960 --> 34:21.123
And every day we have to choose
which one we're gonna be.

34:21.400 --> 34:22.925
And I admit,

34:25.199 --> 34:26.485
I have been both.

34:26.960 --> 34:28.007
Now, no, no, no, no.

34:28.120 --> 34:30.168
That is... It is nothing
to be proud of.

34:30.239 --> 34:33.960
Life is precious,
and it should only be taken

34:34.040 --> 34:37.487
when your very survival
is at stake.

34:37.560 --> 34:39.449
You have to fight the instinct,

34:39.520 --> 34:42.683
basically, that
draws you to blood.

34:44.840 --> 34:51.246
The feeling of blood in your throat and
the  taste of it in your...

34:51.320 --> 34:52.764
Yeah, that... It's just...

34:52.840 --> 34:57.050
It's important that you don't
let it get the better of you.

34:57.120 --> 34:58.451
That's...

34:58.520 --> 34:59.760
Thank you, thank you.

34:59.840 --> 35:00.966
Thanks.

35:07.040 --> 35:10.169
And now, we will use
our power for the hunt!

35:11.760 --> 35:13.250
Flush 'em out!

35:13.320 --> 35:14.731
You have to flush 'em out!

35:19.880 --> 35:21.962
There! Go, go, go, go!

35:36.560 --> 35:37.925
Where the hell did he...

35:47.640 --> 35:49.324
Maggie?

35:49.400 --> 35:50.481
What are you doing?

35:50.880 --> 35:52.723
I'm sharing the hunt.

35:52.800 --> 35:57.283
You're the real thing, an
Erlangen Wieder Weidmann.

35:57.360 --> 36:00.045
You've tasted Kehrseite
blood before.

36:00.720 --> 36:01.846
And tonight,

36:01.920 --> 36:03.410
you're gonna taste
more. Come on.

36:03.480 --> 36:05.926
What? No! No. Are you crazy?

36:06.000 --> 36:07.331
I've already picked him out.
Let's go!

36:07.400 --> 36:08.925
No, Maggie, you can't do this.

36:09.000 --> 36:10.923
Why not? No one
will miss him.

36:11.240 --> 36:15.211
The stronger take the weaker,
that's the old way, the real way.

36:15.280 --> 36:16.930
No, not anymore.
That's...

36:17.040 --> 36:18.530
Not anymore?

36:18.600 --> 36:20.602
Those words just did not
come out of your mouth.

36:20.840 --> 36:22.569
I cannot believe
you just said that.

36:25.120 --> 36:26.849
You're weak.

36:27.080 --> 36:28.241
You're weak.

36:28.320 --> 36:31.767
Just like all the other wannabes
out here playing "find the bunny."

36:31.840 --> 36:33.842
Just like my father
and my brother.

36:33.960 --> 36:38.045
Well, you know what, little
Miss Monroe, guess who's not?

36:38.120 --> 36:39.963
Maggie! Maggie!

36:42.280 --> 36:44.806
Uh, this
one is anything but fresh.

36:44.880 --> 36:46.291
Guesstimate at least a week.

36:46.360 --> 36:47.885
Could still be Hans or his son.

36:47.960 --> 36:49.166
We are close to the ranch.

36:49.240 --> 36:51.242
Well, he says they have
those camps every weekend.

36:51.320 --> 36:53.846
I'm gonna call Monroe,
see if he's still up there.

36:53.920 --> 36:54.920
I saw him! Come on!

36:54.960 --> 36:56.485
Hans! Hans!

36:57.520 --> 36:58.806
We gotta stop her!
What's wrong?

36:58.840 --> 37:00.280
It's Maggie! She's on the hunt!
What?

37:00.320 --> 37:01.920
Maggie? You're crazy.
She's at the house.

37:01.960 --> 37:03.883
I just saw her! She
wanted me to go with her!

37:04.000 --> 37:05.809
Dad, you can't believe this...
Shut up, Todd!

37:05.880 --> 37:06.961
Where did you see her?

37:07.040 --> 37:08.041
Down by the highway...

37:08.160 --> 37:10.447
...she said she already
picked somebody out!

37:10.800 --> 37:11.800
Nick!

37:11.840 --> 37:14.207
We found another body
just off the highway,

37:14.280 --> 37:15.281
killed the same way.

37:15.360 --> 37:16.600
You still at the ranch?

37:16.680 --> 37:19.331
Yeah. I know who's doing it. It's
Hans' daughter. It's Maggie.

37:19.400 --> 37:20.401
His daughter?

37:20.480 --> 37:21.891
She's on the hunt right now!
Where are you?

37:21.960 --> 37:23.166
Just north of the junction.

37:23.240 --> 37:24.446
No, you gotta
come back this way,

37:24.520 --> 37:26.010
we're going
to the highway! Hurry!

37:51.400 --> 37:52.401
Maggie!

38:08.920 --> 38:10.046
Maggie!

38:13.280 --> 38:15.123
There, there. Pull over.

38:20.040 --> 38:21.849
Backpack's here,
no one's with it.

38:40.920 --> 38:42.649
We need an ambulance.
Knife wound.

38:43.920 --> 38:44.921
Help!

38:46.560 --> 38:48.801
I was attacked by an animal.

38:48.880 --> 38:50.484
I was... No.

38:50.560 --> 38:52.528
- No! No, it was an animal!
- Maggie!

38:52.640 --> 38:53.840
- I swear to God!
- Maggie!

38:55.080 --> 38:56.241
No!

38:56.320 --> 38:57.765
Hang in.
Stay right there.

39:00.200 --> 39:01.326
Maggie, Why?

39:01.440 --> 39:03.761
Because you never
paid attention to me,

39:04.520 --> 39:07.888
you never saw how much I wanted
to be a part of your life,

39:07.960 --> 39:10.850
how much all this meant to me.

39:11.960 --> 39:16.522
And then I found out
what even you don't know.

39:18.280 --> 39:20.931
What being a Wesen really means.

39:21.520 --> 39:24.888
You guys are all just
playing in the woods,

39:24.960 --> 39:27.201
like it's some big game.

39:27.360 --> 39:29.328
No, Maggie.
I love you.

39:31.440 --> 39:33.363
I love you, too, Dad.

39:36.480 --> 39:39.484
I just wish you could've
seen me for who I was.

39:42.760 --> 39:44.842
I wasn't just a girl.

39:49.680 --> 39:51.250
No, no.

40:17.480 --> 40:19.687
You are
what you are now.

40:19.760 --> 40:21.967
And there's nothing
we can do to change that.

40:28.800 --> 40:30.768
You can't even look at me.

42:01.480 --> 42:02.766
Juliette, where are you?

42:02.840 --> 42:05.241
You might want to stop by
Aunt Marie's trailer.

42:05.320 --> 42:06.446
What have you done?

42:06.520 --> 42:08.010
Just trying to stay warm, Nick.

42:08.240 --> 42:10.049
I don't have anybody
to hold me anymore.

42:10.120 --> 42:11.849
Juliette...
Bye, Nick.

42:13.120 --> 42:14.565
Juliette!
