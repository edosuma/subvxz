00:01.234 --> 00:02.969
GILES:
 previously on
Buffy The Vampire Slayer--

00:03.003 --> 00:06.073
You two come on in.
Thank you,
kind proprietor.

00:06.107 --> 00:08.141
Just don't touch anything.

00:08.176 --> 00:11.378
She still thinks
 I'm little miss nobody.

00:11.412 --> 00:13.012
Just her sister.

00:13.047 --> 00:14.881
Boy, is she in for a surprise.

00:14.914 --> 00:16.750
Who are you?

00:20.187 --> 00:23.591
You know Walsh pumped all those
chemicals and crap into us.
You got more than anyone.

00:23.623 --> 00:25.759
I'm taking you to the doctor.

00:25.792 --> 00:28.329
The one from the government,
you mean? The ones who did this
to me in the first place?

00:28.361 --> 00:29.862
All patched up.

00:29.896 --> 00:31.399
How's it going in there?

00:31.431 --> 00:34.701
Good.
Back to normal.

00:39.472 --> 00:42.542
(Grunts)

00:42.576 --> 00:44.612
God, I love you
so much.

00:44.645 --> 00:45.978
(Gasps)

00:48.149 --> 00:50.283
(Panting)

01:09.802 --> 01:12.239
(Speaking foreign language)

01:20.248 --> 01:22.816
(All chanting)

01:30.022 --> 01:32.325
(Pounding)

01:32.359 --> 01:35.429
(Speaking foreign language)

01:35.462 --> 01:37.997
(Pounding continues)
(chanting resumes)

01:41.968 --> 01:44.138
(Pounding continues)

01:44.171 --> 01:47.775
(Wind whistling)

01:47.807 --> 01:49.942
(Chanting continues)

02:01.555 --> 02:04.358
(Grunts)
I've always wanted
to kill the Slayer.

02:04.391 --> 02:06.593
And I've always
wanted piano lessons.

02:06.626 --> 02:09.562
So, really,
who's surprised we have
all this unexpressed rage?

02:15.703 --> 02:20.373
But honestly, I think
I'm expressing mine better.

02:20.408 --> 02:22.975
I'll tell you what.

02:24.877 --> 02:26.813
You find yourself a good
anger management class,

02:29.317 --> 02:32.319
and I'll jam this pokey
wood stick through your heart.

02:34.054 --> 02:36.289
(Sighs)

02:36.324 --> 02:39.659
I think that sets the world
speed record for closure.
MAN: Hey.

02:41.762 --> 02:45.199
Miss, if you're lookin'
for one of those rave parties,
I'm afraid you're late.

02:45.233 --> 02:47.901
Chased a bunch of kids
out of here last night.

02:47.935 --> 02:50.403
Oh, right. Yeah. Darn.

02:50.437 --> 02:52.805
My fellow ravers
will be so disappointed.

02:52.840 --> 02:55.543
It was my turn
to bring the bundt cake.

02:55.575 --> 02:58.010
You know, if it
was my call, I'd let you
do whatever you want.

02:58.045 --> 03:00.213
It's not like anybody's
using this place or nothin'.

03:00.247 --> 03:04.183
They just don't pay me enough
to argue with the boss, so--

03:04.217 --> 03:06.219
Already gone.
Oh, hey. Hold it, miss.

03:06.253 --> 03:09.889
Take your, uh,
whatever this is with ya.

03:11.792 --> 03:15.027
-Thank you.
-Glo balls, huh?

03:15.062 --> 03:17.698
I swear, I don't get
your generation.

03:17.730 --> 03:19.533
What is that thing?

03:20.867 --> 03:23.937
I'll let you know
as soon as I find out.

03:27.707 --> 03:29.776
(Theme music plays)

04:24.130 --> 04:28.401
-Dawn, touch nothing.
-Who died and made you
the iron chef?

04:28.435 --> 04:31.904
Look, mom's sick, and I
made her a nice non-instant
breakfast for once.

04:31.939 --> 04:34.173
I don't need you--

04:34.206 --> 04:36.610
(Vase falls)
Oops.

04:38.110 --> 04:40.314
Doing that.
JOYCE:
morning, guys.

04:40.348 --> 04:44.084
Oh. Check out
the "pamper mom" platter.

04:44.117 --> 04:45.952
You two do all this?
Oh, Buffy helped.

04:47.721 --> 04:51.158
-Well, I--I didn't help.
-I'm sure you did.

04:51.191 --> 04:55.463
So, neither of you's
pregnant, failing,
or under indictment?

04:55.495 --> 04:57.497
-Just checking.
-(Scoffs)

04:57.531 --> 05:00.600
We knew you were feeling
less than great, so--

05:00.634 --> 05:03.971
Yeah. The headaches they said
would go away came back and
brought some friends along with.

05:04.004 --> 05:06.439
Well, what did
the doctor say?

05:06.473 --> 05:09.709
Take four of some pills a day
and come back for tests.

05:09.742 --> 05:12.480
-They don't know what's wrong?
-Well, not yet.

05:12.512 --> 05:14.981
That's unacceptable.
I think we should get
a second opinion.

05:15.014 --> 05:17.384
Well, we need a first
opinion first, honey.

05:17.418 --> 05:21.389
-Okay, we'll go right now.
-Buffy, I know you're
concerned, okay?

05:21.422 --> 05:25.959
But don't be. I'm still
the mom, which means I get
to worry about you two,

05:25.992 --> 05:29.463
which is a good thing
because you're
a vampire slayer,

05:29.497 --> 05:31.731
and you, you are
my little pum'kin belly.

05:31.764 --> 05:34.901
(Scoffs)
mom, that's
like my kid name.

05:34.935 --> 05:38.538
-So I can't be retro?
-Did you ever have
any names for me?

05:38.572 --> 05:42.875
No. I think you were
always just Buffy.

05:42.909 --> 05:46.480
I got some names
for ya.

05:46.514 --> 05:50.082
What are you doing
hanging around here?
Isn't this Giles's big day?

05:50.117 --> 05:52.853
Oh, bigger than big.
It's his grand opening.

05:52.886 --> 05:55.889
So go. Bring me back a--

05:55.923 --> 05:57.990
I don't know-- a...

05:58.024 --> 06:00.394
Flying broomstick
or something.

06:00.427 --> 06:03.730
Those never really work.
Whatever.

06:03.764 --> 06:07.166
Book club tonight?
Mm-hmm.

06:07.199 --> 06:09.569
You guys
have a book club?

06:11.904 --> 06:14.040
Okay, I'm gonna go.
I will be back later.

06:14.074 --> 06:16.242
What time is your
doctor's appointment?

06:16.276 --> 06:19.846
I just want to know.
Take it easy.

06:19.879 --> 06:22.115
I want you to relax all day,
keep your feet up,
plenty of Oprah.

06:22.149 --> 06:25.018
Plus, you can check
my rain forest report,

06:25.052 --> 06:27.454
and you know there's, like,
80 badillion old board games--

06:27.487 --> 06:30.122
-Hey! You said I couldn't come.
-Changed my mind.

06:37.465 --> 06:39.331
(Bell jingles)

06:59.519 --> 07:02.689
(Panting)

07:02.790 --> 07:06.293
I told you you couldn't
ditch me. Whoa.

07:06.326 --> 07:10.930
Mr. Giles,
this place is so... Wow.

07:10.963 --> 07:13.233
I mean, check out
all the magic junk.

07:13.266 --> 07:16.168
-Our new slogan.
-So when's it open?

07:16.202 --> 07:18.404
You know, for customers?

07:18.437 --> 07:23.776
-Since 9:00 this morning,
actually.
-Dawn, go. Browse. And--

07:23.810 --> 07:25.612
You break it, you bought it.
Heard you the first 60 times.

07:28.115 --> 07:30.117
Still, not to worry.
Oh--

07:30.149 --> 07:32.653
I've good feelings
about this place.

07:32.685 --> 07:35.923
Magic's a small niche market,
but, um--

07:35.956 --> 07:38.658
Well, think about it.
Sunnydale.

07:38.692 --> 07:41.762
Monsters.
Supply and demand.

07:41.795 --> 07:44.363
They'll be lining up
around the block in no time.

07:44.396 --> 07:48.067
Yeah. You'll be making money
hand over fist.

07:53.040 --> 07:55.543
Which I guess
is a good thing.

07:55.576 --> 07:58.478
You all right?
You seem a little distracted.

07:58.512 --> 08:01.682
It's just my mom's still sick,
and we have no idea
what the deal is.

08:01.714 --> 08:04.050
She is getting
medical attention?

08:04.084 --> 08:06.452
Yeah. We have a highly trained
medical staff...

08:06.485 --> 08:08.521
working around the clock
to tell us diddly.

08:08.555 --> 08:11.324
I'm sorry.
Still, you know,

08:11.358 --> 08:14.360
time and patience--
both great comforts.
(Bell jingles)

08:16.564 --> 08:18.731
Giles, where's
your hat and cloak?

08:18.766 --> 08:21.500
Yeah, the hype
was out of control.

08:21.535 --> 08:23.971
DAWN:
Willow, you gotta
see this.

08:24.004 --> 08:28.141
They have the coolest talismen--
mans-- talisguys.

08:28.175 --> 08:32.412
Actually, I have a little
scooby-centric deal
to deal with first.

08:32.445 --> 08:35.248
I put this
before the group.

08:35.282 --> 08:37.350
What the hell is it?

08:37.384 --> 08:39.385
It appears to be
paranormal in origin.

08:39.418 --> 08:44.224
-How can you tell?
-Well, it's so shiny.

08:44.256 --> 08:47.326
-Found it on patrol.
-May be more where
that came from.

08:47.360 --> 08:49.897
I say we go back out
again tonight.

08:49.929 --> 08:51.731
Um, sure.

08:51.764 --> 08:54.366
You can't patrol.
Buffy said.

08:54.400 --> 08:57.037
-No, I didn't.
-Yeah, remember?

08:57.070 --> 08:59.338
You said it'd be easier
if you didn't have to
look out for anybody.

08:59.371 --> 09:02.542
-Well, I wasn't
talking about Riley.
-Don't worry about it.

09:02.576 --> 09:05.378
Oh, she just said you
look even cuter when you're
all weak and kitteny,

09:05.412 --> 09:08.615
and she'd
better go solo,
or you'd get hurt.

09:08.649 --> 09:11.551
So, welcome to the club.
She'll never let me go either.

09:16.456 --> 09:18.926
What? What?

09:18.958 --> 09:22.763
Giles, you got
that danger room
set up out back?

09:22.796 --> 09:25.365
I'm feelin' the need
for a little physical rehab
about now.

09:25.398 --> 09:27.366
Of course. Yes.
If any customers do--

09:27.399 --> 09:31.203
-On it.
-Dawn, we're going.

09:31.238 --> 09:32.740
Buffy, wait.

09:34.841 --> 09:37.878
Go easy on her.
Why?

09:37.911 --> 09:42.750
I can't help it.
I just have all this
involuntary empathy for Dawn,

09:42.783 --> 09:45.985
'Cause she's,
you know, a big spaz.

09:46.019 --> 09:49.489
She's so annoying,
especially now that mom's sick.

09:49.522 --> 09:51.924
She's all over her,
while I have to be the grown-up,

09:51.959 --> 09:54.260
and the two of them
are like the giggle twins,

09:54.293 --> 09:56.663
and why can't I ever be
little pum'kin belly?

09:58.431 --> 10:01.567
While I don't feel qualified
to address the last part,

10:01.600 --> 10:05.105
I can tell you that Dawn's
not just the youngest.

10:05.138 --> 10:08.508
She's the baby,
and maybe your mom
needs that right now.

10:08.541 --> 10:13.013
Dawn doesn't care
what my mom--

10:13.046 --> 10:17.250
You just have no idea how much
I wish I were an only child
these days.

10:17.283 --> 10:20.687
(Clattering,
glass shatters)

10:20.721 --> 10:22.621
DAWN: Oops.

10:25.859 --> 10:28.327
We can't all be born with big,
fancy "chosen one" reflexes,
you know.

10:28.360 --> 10:31.163
Shh. Mom?
JOYCE:
Mmm.

10:31.197 --> 10:33.165
Mom?
(TV, indistinct)

10:33.200 --> 10:36.102
What's wrong?
(TV off)

10:36.135 --> 10:38.205
It's-- it's just my head.

10:38.238 --> 10:42.042
-I'm taking you to the doctor.
-No, sweetheart, I'm fine.

10:42.075 --> 10:45.812
We don't know that.
We don't know anything.
We're going.

10:45.846 --> 10:47.580
I just need
my prescription. Please?

10:50.817 --> 10:52.820
Hospital pharmacy open?
Mm-hmm.

10:52.852 --> 10:55.621
Ten minutes.

10:55.654 --> 10:58.658
(Woman on P.A., indistinct)

10:58.692 --> 11:00.527
Excuse me.

11:02.195 --> 11:05.631
Hey, it's, uh, Buffy,
isn't it?
Uh--

11:05.664 --> 11:08.368
Ben. But you can
call me Man-nurse.
Everybody else here does.

11:08.400 --> 11:13.306
I don't belong here.
I have important instructions.
Fascists!

11:13.340 --> 11:15.908
You're hurting the nice intern
who's here to help you.

11:15.942 --> 11:19.412
I need nine CC's
of phenobarbital in this--
(grunting)

11:19.446 --> 11:24.384
Or not. Let's strap him.
It's for your own good,
I promise.

11:24.417 --> 11:26.886
Not to be rampantly sexist
in the workplace,

11:26.919 --> 11:29.322
but you've got some
serious muscles for a girl.

11:29.355 --> 11:32.325
I, um--
Radioactive spider bite.

11:32.359 --> 11:36.328
How'd you guess?
I'm a doctor.
Well, almost.

11:36.363 --> 11:40.432
Doesn't--doesn't even help.
Doesn't make a damn
bit of difference!

11:40.466 --> 11:43.536
I-I-I've met this guy.
He's a security guard.

11:43.570 --> 11:46.538
-He's not crazy.
-If you say so.

11:46.572 --> 11:49.241
They're coming at you.

11:49.275 --> 11:51.510
Don't think
you're above it, missy.

11:51.543 --> 11:53.446
They come through the family.

11:53.480 --> 11:56.048
They get to your family.

11:56.082 --> 11:58.518
My family?
What do you mean?

11:58.551 --> 12:01.388
Let's get him to exam one.
Now would be nice.

12:01.421 --> 12:05.024
Your family. Your family!

12:05.057 --> 12:09.395
I'm real sorry about that.
Here.

12:09.428 --> 12:13.133
-For your mom?
-Yeah, thanks.

12:13.166 --> 12:16.269
-She's not feeling better?
-Not yet.

12:16.302 --> 12:18.605
But she-- she will be.

12:18.638 --> 12:20.472
I'm starting to
figure out what's wrong.

12:24.744 --> 12:26.947
(Man speaking
foreign language)

12:43.363 --> 12:45.164
(Loud pounding)

12:55.307 --> 12:57.376
(Pounding continues)

13:11.124 --> 13:15.528
There you are.
I have been looking
all over for you.

13:24.171 --> 13:27.740
Thank you for choosing
to shop at the magic box,
and please do come again.

13:32.211 --> 13:34.380
(Bell jingles)

13:34.413 --> 13:36.816
Did you see that? Customers.
Real live customers.

13:36.850 --> 13:38.817
They came in,
and I gave them things,

13:38.851 --> 13:40.820
and they gave me money,
and then they left.

13:40.854 --> 13:43.023
(Laughs)
It's brilliant.

13:43.056 --> 13:47.394
Congratulations.
You're an official
capitalist running dog.

13:47.427 --> 13:50.697
But I gotta tell ya,
on the orbular front,
we're batting zeros.

13:50.730 --> 13:53.299
Well then, we'll just have
to keep trying.
Look at this.

13:53.332 --> 13:56.702
If there's anything you
need help with, let me know.

13:56.735 --> 13:59.538
Hmm.
Your conjuring powder's
grotesquely overpriced.

13:59.572 --> 14:02.975
Anya--

14:03.009 --> 14:06.312
I'm sorry.
I'm nearly out of money.

14:06.346 --> 14:08.815
I've never had to
afford things before,
and it's making me bitter.

14:08.847 --> 14:12.351
The change is palpable.
That stuff doesn't come cheap.
(Bell jingling)

14:12.384 --> 14:14.486
Well, you're getting
ripped off.

14:14.520 --> 14:16.255
I could hook you up direct
with the troll that sheds it.

14:18.791 --> 14:21.928
Giles, I have an idea
what's making my mom sick.

14:21.961 --> 14:24.530
Have you spoken
with her doctors?
They won't find anything.

14:24.563 --> 14:27.767
What's hurting her--
it's supernatural.

14:27.799 --> 14:29.735
The night watchman
who found this thing--

14:29.769 --> 14:31.638
He went crazy,
like overnight.

14:34.073 --> 14:36.576
It won't hurt us.
I had it on me all night.

14:36.609 --> 14:40.547
But this guy-- he saw things.
He said things.

14:40.580 --> 14:42.715
Such as?

14:42.749 --> 14:45.118
They'll come at me
through my family.

14:45.152 --> 14:47.687
And, uh--
who-who will?

14:47.720 --> 14:49.688
I don't know... Yet.

14:49.721 --> 14:52.024
But whatever
touched this guy,

14:52.058 --> 14:55.261
it made him see through
what the rest of us
are seeing.

14:55.294 --> 14:58.697
He knew someone's hurting
my mom, and they're
trying to get to me.

14:58.730 --> 15:02.134
It's possible, but still, uh,

15:02.168 --> 15:04.571
the ramblings of a madman
aren't much to go on.

15:04.604 --> 15:07.941
Yeah, but it's a start.
We need to find out who's
making my mom sick and how.

15:07.975 --> 15:10.909
Then what?

15:10.943 --> 15:14.846
Then I hunt them,
find them, and kill them.

15:18.750 --> 15:22.254
FEMALE DEMON:
You know, when you think
about it, I'm the victim here.

15:22.288 --> 15:25.658
First off--
I don't even want to be here.

15:25.692 --> 15:28.794
And I'm not talking about
this room or this city
or this state or this planet.

15:28.827 --> 15:30.998
I'm talking about the whole
mortal coil now, you know?

15:31.030 --> 15:33.932
It's disgusting!

15:33.966 --> 15:39.072
The food. The clothes.
The people.

15:39.105 --> 15:42.308
I could crap a better existence
than this.

15:42.341 --> 15:44.844
But-- okay.

15:44.876 --> 15:46.946
And feel free to tell me...

15:46.980 --> 15:48.947
if this next part gets
a little too personal,

15:48.981 --> 15:52.184
because I'm told I have
boundary issues.

15:52.219 --> 15:54.053
But I'm hurt!

15:55.955 --> 16:00.726
Yes. By your incredibly
selfish behavior.

16:03.129 --> 16:05.164
News flash, hairdo.

16:05.197 --> 16:07.000
It's not always about you.

16:08.301 --> 16:11.238
All I want is the key!

16:13.306 --> 16:15.707
Wh--why--

16:15.741 --> 16:18.044
Why can't you tell me
where the key is?

16:21.880 --> 16:23.750
Oh.

16:27.220 --> 16:30.256
Forgive me, Monky.

16:32.225 --> 16:35.794
Sometimes I just--
I get so anxious--

16:35.827 --> 16:38.565
Like there's something
deep inside of me,

16:38.597 --> 16:41.868
and it's swelling up,
and it's making me crazy--

16:41.900 --> 16:46.806
That I forget there's all that
duct tape on your face.
(Whimpers)

16:46.838 --> 16:48.707
Now...

16:50.376 --> 16:52.544
Tell me where...

16:52.578 --> 16:55.048
the key is.
(Grunts)

16:55.081 --> 16:56.749
(Groaning)

16:56.783 --> 16:59.586
Or I'm going bowling.
(Groaning continues)

16:59.619 --> 17:02.522
(Sputtering)

17:02.554 --> 17:05.458
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.
The stutter's sexy.
Keep it coming.

17:09.229 --> 17:11.931
(Speaking foreign language)

17:14.031 --> 17:17.237
(Speaking foreign language)

17:17.269 --> 17:19.471
Speak American!

17:20.771 --> 17:23.910
I... will tell you--

17:23.942 --> 17:27.114
(Breathing heavily)

17:27.146 --> 17:28.980
Nothing.

17:38.458 --> 17:40.826
Fine.

17:42.662 --> 17:44.763
You know what I wish?

17:46.465 --> 17:50.702
I wish that you could feel
what I'm feeling right now.

17:50.737 --> 17:53.640
Lady, whatever you are,
whatever you're on, please--

17:56.742 --> 17:59.412
'Cause I don't know how much
more of this I can take.

18:01.114 --> 18:02.848
MAN:
I-- I have a wife.

18:05.817 --> 18:07.854
Her-- her name's Jennifer.
We-- we have two daughters.

18:14.461 --> 18:17.896
I bet this is fun for you,
isn't it?

18:17.930 --> 18:21.334
Say it.
You like to torture me.

18:22.669 --> 18:25.172
Why? You don't even
own the damn thing.

18:25.204 --> 18:28.240
And I want it, I need it,
and I've gotta have it now.

18:28.275 --> 18:31.411
And you keep refusing
to tell me where the key is!

18:31.443 --> 18:34.314
And it's typical--
it's typical-- it's typical--

18:34.346 --> 18:37.849
The whole mortal meatsack
comes complete with stink
and bile, sweat and protein--

18:37.884 --> 18:40.752
Yes, I said humans--
Not now! Mommy's talking!

18:40.787 --> 18:44.257
Wriggling, piling, prowling,
crawling, clowning, cavorting,
doing it over...

18:44.290 --> 18:47.026
and over and over and over
until someone's gonna
sit down on their tuffet...

18:47.058 --> 18:48.994
and make this birthing stop!

18:49.028 --> 18:50.829
(Screams)

18:54.834 --> 18:56.669
(Groaning)

19:01.740 --> 19:03.509
(Whimpering)

19:06.679 --> 19:08.681
(Sighs)

19:08.714 --> 19:10.950
That is so much better.

19:10.982 --> 19:14.287
(Bell jingling)

19:14.320 --> 19:17.324
Do you gift wrap?
Do we!

19:17.356 --> 19:22.028
Do we? Oh, we do.
A little help.

19:22.060 --> 19:24.631
No, no, no, uh, g-ground,
uh, cloven hooves...

19:24.663 --> 19:27.133
are 30% off, um--

19:27.165 --> 19:29.836
The other ones
are full price.

19:31.170 --> 19:33.405
That's, um, not candy.

19:33.440 --> 19:35.541
And, Xander?

19:35.575 --> 19:38.076
There's too many of them--
people.

19:38.109 --> 19:40.212
A-a-and they all
seem to want things.

19:40.247 --> 19:42.315
I hear ya.

19:42.348 --> 19:44.717
Stay British.
You'll be okay.

19:46.452 --> 19:48.887
The thousand-yard stare.

19:48.921 --> 19:51.590
Damn, you hate to
see it on any man,
but especially in retail.

19:54.059 --> 19:56.863
Please go.

19:56.895 --> 20:00.267
Anya, the shopkeepers
union of America called.

20:00.299 --> 20:04.002
They want me to tell you that
"please go" just got replaced
with "have a nice day."

20:04.036 --> 20:07.240
But I have their money.
Who cares what kind
of day they have?

20:07.273 --> 20:09.942
No one. It's just
a long cultural tradition...

20:09.976 --> 20:12.010
of raging insincerity.

20:12.044 --> 20:13.779
Embrace it.
(Bell jingles)

20:15.213 --> 20:17.317
Hey, you!
Have a nice day.

20:18.550 --> 20:20.319
There's my girl!

20:24.656 --> 20:27.960
Did you ever think
in a million years you'd
miss the high school library?

20:27.993 --> 20:30.028
Someone put a spell
on my mom.

20:30.061 --> 20:32.131
Something to make it
seem like she's sick.

20:33.465 --> 20:36.302
That's a new kinda nasty.
Any suspects?

20:36.336 --> 20:39.005
Well, I've got
the list narrowed down
to just under infinity.

20:43.276 --> 20:45.111
Does this look
right to you?

20:47.480 --> 20:49.816
Sure. If you wrapped it
with your feet.

20:52.984 --> 20:56.655
You know, Buffy,
there used to be
this French sorcerer...

20:56.689 --> 20:59.791
back in the 16th
I-don't-know-what named, um--

20:59.826 --> 21:02.795
Cloutier.
So cute in his
little knickers.

21:02.828 --> 21:04.931
But he had this one spell
demons just hated...

21:04.963 --> 21:07.467
Called tirer la couverture.

21:07.500 --> 21:09.602
Rotate many food stuffs?

21:09.635 --> 21:11.804
Pull the curtain back.

21:11.837 --> 21:15.442
A spell to see spells.
Well, a trance
to see spells, actually.

21:15.474 --> 21:18.611
-But you get the idea. Try that.
-What do you mean, "see spells"?

21:18.644 --> 21:21.480
Um, all spells leave
a-a trace signature.

21:21.513 --> 21:25.250
It's just not perceptible
to the human eye. Um--

21:25.284 --> 21:29.121
In this case,
it could be the image
of a hand choking your mother.

21:29.154 --> 21:31.257
Or a cloud of mist around her.

21:31.289 --> 21:35.327
Or maybe the shape of the demon
that's performing the spell?

21:35.362 --> 21:37.663
Uh, possible, yes.

21:37.697 --> 21:40.767
Okay. So I'll do what
monsieur silk knickers did.

21:40.799 --> 21:43.802
I'll go home, I'll get trancey,
and I'll see what's
affecting my mom.

21:43.836 --> 21:47.006
-I don't know, Buffy. Trances?
-Yes, Buffy,

21:47.038 --> 21:50.676
the sorcerer Cloutier
was legendary.
(Object thumps)

21:50.710 --> 21:54.046
His-- his skills
at achieving higher states
of consciousness were--

21:54.079 --> 21:56.982
Better than mine?
I knew he was gonna say that.

21:57.016 --> 22:00.318
But I've been practicing
concentration drills.
I know I'm close.

22:00.353 --> 22:02.521
-Are you ready?
-It's my mom.

22:02.555 --> 22:05.424
I'll get ready.
What do I need?

22:07.759 --> 22:10.663
Thanks for coming over.
I really appreciate the help.

22:10.696 --> 22:13.199
Sure thing.
So what do I do?

22:13.231 --> 22:16.167
Lots. Tons.

22:16.201 --> 22:18.336
Lots and lots of tons.

22:18.371 --> 22:21.307
This is all kind of--
New terrain?

22:21.339 --> 22:23.375
All prayin', no slayin'.

22:23.410 --> 22:25.978
Okay, so the incense
needs to be ignited,

22:26.011 --> 22:28.580
and-- and there's a job.

22:28.615 --> 22:31.483
And this stuff needs to
get poured around me in
a circle counterclockwise--

22:31.518 --> 22:34.820
-So you need me to light incense
and pour sand?
-Magic incense...

22:34.854 --> 22:37.189
And-- and spooky sand.

22:37.222 --> 22:41.192
-And the ritual itself is--
-Something you do alone.

22:41.227 --> 22:44.063
You sure this isn't your way
of trying to make me feel less--

22:44.096 --> 22:46.932
What are the words--
cute and weak and kittenish?

22:46.965 --> 22:48.768
Kitteny.

22:48.800 --> 22:51.804
Right. Much manlier.

22:52.971 --> 22:55.407
Look, um--

22:58.210 --> 23:01.913
I really am okay.
I know.

23:01.948 --> 23:04.083
So I'm not quite
super guy anymore.

23:04.115 --> 23:07.420
It was borrowed power anyway.
I had to give it back sometime.

23:08.921 --> 23:11.923
I know you can
handle yourself.

23:11.958 --> 23:13.660
I just didn't want
to see you get hurt.

23:15.161 --> 23:17.229
Maybe instead of you
trying to take care of me,

23:17.262 --> 23:19.865
we agree to take care
of each other.

23:19.898 --> 23:22.167
Deal?

23:24.471 --> 23:26.573
Done.

23:26.605 --> 23:28.474
Good.

23:29.741 --> 23:31.978
For luck.
Hey.

23:33.480 --> 23:35.847
A girl needs more luck
than that.

23:41.488 --> 23:43.288
Have a nice trip.

24:15.988 --> 24:18.124
(Knocking on door)

24:18.156 --> 24:22.094
DAWN:
what are you doing?
My boyfriend. Go away.

24:22.127 --> 24:24.163
Liar.
Are you doing magic?

24:24.195 --> 24:27.634
-No, I'm not.
-Can I watch?

24:27.666 --> 24:30.336
-No, you can't!
-Oh, come on!

24:30.368 --> 24:34.641
Please! Please, like,
times 10 and cubed! Please?

24:34.673 --> 24:37.609
Oh!

24:37.644 --> 24:40.512
Yeah, well, I can smell
your stinky incense
down the hall, you know.

24:40.547 --> 24:43.048
And your clothes
are gonna reek.

24:43.082 --> 24:46.018
And if you are doing magic,
I'm so telling.

24:46.051 --> 24:48.186
Fine! Go! Go tell.

24:48.220 --> 24:51.723
Go do whatever you want.
Just go!

24:58.931 --> 25:00.767
(Sighs)

26:31.289 --> 26:34.026
-(Joyce, distorted) Buffy?
-Mom.

26:37.930 --> 26:40.132
Are you going out?

26:40.165 --> 26:43.970
Either modern medicine's
working or I just took
the world's best placebo.

26:44.002 --> 26:46.572
Either way, I'm going out
for a couple hours.

26:46.605 --> 26:49.508
-Nothing.
-Huh?

26:49.540 --> 26:51.542
There's nothing.

26:53.311 --> 26:55.346
Are you sure you're
feeling okay?

26:55.381 --> 26:57.548
You seem a little
out of it.

27:06.357 --> 27:08.359
Hey. Buffy.

27:08.394 --> 27:11.462
Oh. Yeah. I'm fine.

27:11.497 --> 27:13.665
Uh, long--
long day's all.

27:13.700 --> 27:16.067
You go have a good time.

27:17.836 --> 27:19.905
You're so grown up.

27:27.913 --> 27:29.749
(Door closes)

28:10.856 --> 28:13.325
(Dawn, distorted)
Buffy.

28:13.358 --> 28:15.193
Buffy!

28:17.763 --> 28:20.465
Buffy, who said you could
come in my room?

28:25.604 --> 28:27.605
(Wind whistling)

28:27.638 --> 28:30.308
You're not my sister.

28:37.916 --> 28:40.586
Yeah, like I even want to
be related to your nasty--

28:40.618 --> 28:43.255
Ow! What are you doing?
What are you?

28:43.288 --> 28:45.624
Get off me!
You wanna hurt me?

28:45.656 --> 28:47.726
Let go of me, you freak!
Then you deal with me.

28:47.759 --> 28:51.230
I'm telling mom.
You stay away
from my mother.

28:51.262 --> 28:53.499
(Grunts)

29:00.807 --> 29:03.474
(Telephone ringing)

29:03.509 --> 29:05.912
What?
GILES:
Buffy?

29:05.944 --> 29:07.946
Oh, I'm glad I've caught you.
I think we may have...

29:07.980 --> 29:09.949
Underestimated
what we're dealing with.

29:11.983 --> 29:14.619
-Go on.
-Um, it's--

29:14.653 --> 29:18.057
We've uncovered
more than expected
about this-- this orb.

29:18.089 --> 29:20.926
Uh, it's, um--

29:20.960 --> 29:23.796
It's called the--
the Dagon Sphere,

29:23.829 --> 29:26.231
and it has a history
going back many centuries.

29:26.265 --> 29:29.067
What's it do?
It's a protective device...

29:29.101 --> 29:32.805
Used to ward off
ancient primordial evil.

29:32.838 --> 29:37.076
Any word on what
this evil looks like?
Unfortunately, no.

29:37.108 --> 29:40.913
This is where accounts get--
Excuse me.

29:40.947 --> 29:43.148
This is where
accounts get vague.

29:43.182 --> 29:47.252
All we've managed
to uncover so far is, um--

29:47.286 --> 29:49.488
Is the Dagon Sphere
was created to repel...

29:49.520 --> 29:51.522
"that which cannot be named."

29:51.557 --> 29:54.326
I'm gonna go back
to the factory
where I found it.

29:54.359 --> 29:58.130
Whoever planted this doohickey's
got answers.

29:58.163 --> 30:01.133
Buffy, you've heard me
say this before,
but do be careful.

30:01.166 --> 30:03.701
Anything that goes unnamed
is usually an object
of deep worship...

30:03.734 --> 30:05.703
or great fear--
maybe both.

30:05.737 --> 30:08.173
Have you completed
the trance?

30:08.207 --> 30:10.942
Seen what's harming
your mother?

30:10.977 --> 30:12.878
That's the thing.

30:12.912 --> 30:14.746
I just saw--

30:15.914 --> 30:18.349
Yes?

30:18.384 --> 30:21.252
Nothing.
It didn't work.

30:24.923 --> 30:26.692
What are you
talking about?

30:27.926 --> 30:30.828
Slayer stuff.
I'm going out.

30:32.830 --> 30:35.067
Do you really think I care
you're the Slayer?

30:39.105 --> 30:41.339
What's that
supposed to mean?

30:44.742 --> 30:47.479
I'll be home in an hour.

30:47.512 --> 30:49.480
Mom's coming back.

30:49.515 --> 30:51.917
I'll be back first.

31:13.372 --> 31:15.207
Spike.

31:16.442 --> 31:17.808
Hi, Buffy.

31:20.112 --> 31:21.880
Don't take this
the wrong way, but--

31:21.913 --> 31:23.214
Ow!

31:24.916 --> 31:27.252
What are you doing here?

31:27.286 --> 31:29.421
Look--
Five words or less.

31:30.957 --> 31:34.026
Out... For... A... Walk...

31:34.059 --> 31:36.194
Bitch.

31:36.228 --> 31:38.730
Out for a walk at night
by my house.

31:38.763 --> 31:41.032
No one has time
for this, William.

31:41.067 --> 31:44.269
On your merry way then.
(Scoffs)

31:44.302 --> 31:46.904
You know, contrary to one's
self-involved world view,

31:46.939 --> 31:49.875
your house happens to be
directly between...

31:49.907 --> 31:53.412
Parts... and other parts
of this town.

31:53.444 --> 31:56.082
And I would pass by in the day,
but I feel I'm outgrowing...

31:56.115 --> 31:59.317
my whole
"burst into flame" phase.

31:59.351 --> 32:02.421
Fine. Keep going,
I cut you a break.

32:02.453 --> 32:04.289
Yeah, okay. Let me guess.
You won't kill me?

32:04.323 --> 32:06.458
(Sighs)
Ooh!

32:06.491 --> 32:08.794
The whole
"crowd-pleasing threats
and swagger" routine.

32:08.826 --> 32:11.896
Outstandingly original.
You know, I'm just
passing through.

32:11.930 --> 32:14.465
Satisfied?

32:14.500 --> 32:17.635
You know,
(chuckles)
I really hope so,

32:17.669 --> 32:20.071
'Cause god knows you need
some satisfaction in life...

32:20.105 --> 32:22.074
Besides shagging
captain cardboard.

32:22.107 --> 32:24.809
And-- and I never really
liked you anyway,

32:24.843 --> 32:27.512
and-- and you have
stupid hair.

33:42.019 --> 33:43.855
Buffy?

33:46.023 --> 33:47.893
Girls?

33:52.763 --> 33:55.834
Where is everybody?
DAWN: Hi, Mom.

33:55.866 --> 34:00.005
(Gasps)
Oh. Dawn.

34:00.038 --> 34:02.173
Where's Buffy?
You don't have
to worry about her.

34:02.208 --> 34:04.276
You're probably right.

34:04.309 --> 34:06.612
I mean, it's not like
she's never patrolled before.

34:06.644 --> 34:09.414
Anyway, I was feeling
kind of, uh--

34:09.447 --> 34:11.882
What's the medical term?
Crappy?

34:11.916 --> 34:13.851
So I called off
the big night out.

34:13.885 --> 34:16.954
-Want tea, mom?
-Mmm.

34:16.987 --> 34:19.224
I made it for you.

34:28.967 --> 34:31.202
Whoa.

34:31.237 --> 34:33.371
Hey. It was--

34:33.405 --> 34:35.974
It was you who planted
the Dagon Sphere, right?

34:36.007 --> 34:37.376
Oh!

34:37.409 --> 34:40.277
I got it.

34:40.311 --> 34:43.481
Don't worry.
I'm stronger than I look.

34:43.514 --> 34:45.483
I've had experience
with stuff like this before.

34:45.516 --> 34:47.619
(Grunting)
best of all,

34:49.820 --> 34:51.356
I'm not stupid.

35:02.032 --> 35:03.969
You sure about
that last part?

35:09.974 --> 35:12.643
(Bell jingles)

35:12.677 --> 35:16.681
Would someone please rip
that bloody bell off its hinges?

35:16.715 --> 35:19.518
Would that involve moving?

35:19.550 --> 35:21.920
My feet are numb.

35:21.952 --> 35:25.291
I'll see your numbness,
and I'll raise you
a lower-back pain.

35:25.324 --> 35:27.858
I think I liked it better
when demons would
just crash in here...

35:27.893 --> 35:30.161
And tear the place apart.

35:30.262 --> 35:33.632
-Just seemed so much simpler.
-You're out of crystal balls.

35:33.664 --> 35:35.467
Those babies are really popular
with the amateurs.

35:35.501 --> 35:39.938
Better restock
and raise the price 10%.
Make it 15.

35:39.971 --> 35:42.974
-Anya--
-your cash register looks like
squirrels nest in it.

35:43.007 --> 35:45.710
-Anya--
-And the hand of glory
packs some serious raw power.

35:45.744 --> 35:48.679
-Better institute a 7-day
background check for--
-Anya!

35:51.550 --> 35:53.952
Would you like a job?

35:53.985 --> 35:56.054
Okay.

35:56.086 --> 36:00.659
Good. Then we can
talk shop tomorrow.

36:00.692 --> 36:02.527
Okay,

36:03.695 --> 36:05.530
Boss.

36:07.032 --> 36:10.369
Hey, any word from Buffy
on how her spell went?

36:10.402 --> 36:13.304
She said it didn't work.

36:13.338 --> 36:15.306
Now she's off investigating...

36:15.340 --> 36:17.675
Whoever left
the Dagon Sphere behind.

36:17.708 --> 36:20.811
You're not worried about
the slaymaster general,
are you, big "G"?

36:20.846 --> 36:22.981
No, no.

36:23.014 --> 36:25.583
Just hope she isn't
doing anything too rash.

36:29.255 --> 36:31.088
And another thing--
I just want you to know--

36:33.925 --> 36:37.496
This whole
"beat ya to death"
thing I'm doin'?

36:37.528 --> 36:39.431
It's valuable time
out of life that I'm
never gonna get back.

36:42.067 --> 36:44.001
(Groans)
Wait.

36:44.034 --> 36:46.036
I've always wanted
to try this. You know
that thing with worms...

36:46.070 --> 36:49.275
Where if you have one,
you rip it in half,
you get two worms?

36:49.307 --> 36:51.376
Do you think
that'll work with you?

36:53.445 --> 36:56.782
You hit me!
What are you, crazy?

36:56.815 --> 36:59.016
You can't go around...
hitting people.

36:59.050 --> 37:01.420
What, were you...
born in a barn?

37:02.653 --> 37:04.623
Fine. Be that way.
(Groans)

37:09.094 --> 37:11.630
(Grunting)

37:11.663 --> 37:15.199
I just noticed something.
You have super powers.

37:15.233 --> 37:18.903
That is so cool.
Can you fly?

37:18.936 --> 37:20.237
No!

37:29.079 --> 37:31.782
(Moaning)

37:33.083 --> 37:35.521
Hey! Hey, hands off
my holy man.

37:56.106 --> 37:59.143
(Rumbling)

38:04.349 --> 38:05.784
(No audible dialogue)

38:11.456 --> 38:13.458
Stop, please.

38:13.492 --> 38:16.061
No. We have
to keep going.

38:18.295 --> 38:21.065
(Grunting)

38:23.969 --> 38:26.605
My journey is done,
I think.

38:26.637 --> 38:29.173
Don't get metaphory on me.
We're going.

38:29.206 --> 38:33.277
Uh, you have to--
The key.

38:33.311 --> 38:36.181
You must protect
the key.

38:36.213 --> 38:38.449
Fine. We can protect
the key together, okay?

38:38.483 --> 38:40.818
Just far, far from here.

38:40.851 --> 38:43.389
Many more die...

38:43.422 --> 38:46.056
If you don't keep it safe.

38:46.090 --> 38:48.860
How? What is it?

38:48.893 --> 38:52.463
The key is energy.

38:52.498 --> 38:54.800
It's a portal.

38:54.833 --> 38:57.268
It opens the door.

38:58.737 --> 39:02.373
The-- the Dagon Sphere?
No.

39:04.242 --> 39:08.346
For centuries,
it had no form at all.

39:08.380 --> 39:10.581
My brethren,

39:10.615 --> 39:13.083
its only keepers.

39:13.117 --> 39:16.221
Then... the abomination...

39:17.456 --> 39:19.490
found us.

39:19.525 --> 39:21.760
We had to hide the key.

39:21.793 --> 39:25.362
Gave it form,
molded it flesh,

39:25.396 --> 39:29.134
made it human,
and sent it to you.

39:31.536 --> 39:33.371
Dawn.

39:35.907 --> 39:37.976
She's the key.

39:39.644 --> 39:42.947
You put that in my house?

39:42.981 --> 39:46.717
We knew the Slayer
would protect.

39:46.751 --> 39:49.454
My memories, my mom's--

39:49.487 --> 39:52.958
-We built them.
-Then unbuild them.

39:52.990 --> 39:54.992
This is my life you're--
(coughing)

39:58.730 --> 40:01.467
You cannot abandon.

40:03.101 --> 40:05.135
I didn't ask for this.

40:05.170 --> 40:08.273
I don't even know--
what is she?

40:09.507 --> 40:11.809
Human.

40:11.842 --> 40:15.780
Now human... and helpless.

40:15.813 --> 40:18.115
Please.

40:19.349 --> 40:23.387
She's an innocent in this.

40:23.420 --> 40:25.590
She needs you.

40:29.427 --> 40:31.262
She's not my sister.

40:33.931 --> 40:36.601
She doesn't know that.

41:06.965 --> 41:08.800
You're home.

41:10.536 --> 41:12.503
I wasn't bothering her.

41:15.472 --> 41:17.474
What was that all about?

41:18.710 --> 41:20.579
Nothing.

41:26.050 --> 41:27.885
Sister stuff.

41:31.222 --> 41:33.023
DAWN:
Go away.

41:38.664 --> 41:40.498
I'm sorry.

41:42.768 --> 41:45.836
You hurt my arm.
I know.

41:47.572 --> 41:49.373
Butthole.

41:52.210 --> 41:54.045
Really sorry.

41:57.347 --> 42:00.184
I tell you I have this theory?

42:00.217 --> 42:03.989
It goes where you're the one
who's not my sister,

42:04.021 --> 42:07.057
'Cause mom adopted you
from a shoe box full of
baby howler monkeys...

42:07.092 --> 42:09.860
and never told you
'cause it could hurt
your delicate baby feelings.

42:19.871 --> 42:21.639
That's your theory?

42:23.041 --> 42:26.612
Explains your fashion sense...
And smell.

42:29.547 --> 42:31.916
I'm sorry, okay?

42:31.949 --> 42:34.085
Broken record, much?

42:34.119 --> 42:36.454
You can't even take an apology.

42:36.487 --> 42:38.556
You always do that, ever sin--

42:52.637 --> 42:54.773
I just had a bad day.

42:54.806 --> 42:57.141
Well, join the club.

42:57.175 --> 42:59.443
Can I be president?
I'm president.

43:01.179 --> 43:03.949
You could be the janitor.

43:03.981 --> 43:05.851
Okay.

43:21.166 --> 43:23.835
Buffy?
Yeah?

43:25.036 --> 43:26.838
What's wrong with mom?

43:31.976 --> 43:34.512
I don't know.

43:53.798 --> 43:57.635
(theme music plays)

44:23.894 --> 44:25.931
Grr! Arrgh!
