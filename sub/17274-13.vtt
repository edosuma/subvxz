WEBVTT

00:01.696 --> 00:03.664
We need to get her in deeper.

00:03.833 --> 00:06.233
Mashkov might have access
to Intel on Belenko.

00:06.338 --> 00:07.874
Getting our hands on it
would be a game changer.

00:08.003 --> 00:09.138
You think Tony was murdered?

00:09.275 --> 00:10.739
He wouldn't drink himself
to death.

00:10.876 --> 00:12.380
- Who would want that?
- Belenko.

00:12.509 --> 00:13.844
There's a pattern
to his attacks.

00:13.981 --> 00:16.285
Each one killed a guy
from my unit--

00:16.414 --> 00:18.381
first, Charlie Schinderman
in Chicago,

00:18.518 --> 00:21.318
then Mueller, which was based
on false Intel fed to us,

00:21.456 --> 00:22.791
and he had Tony poisoned.

00:22.928 --> 00:24.223
Auggie, you could be next.

00:24.361 --> 00:25.464
You need to be protected.

00:25.594 --> 00:26.594
While you're here,

00:26.666 --> 00:28.402
you want to introduce me
to my babysitter?

00:28.531 --> 00:29.531
Pete, come meet Auggie.

00:29.603 --> 00:30.634
- Hey, Auggie.
- Pete.

00:30.739 --> 00:32.234
She's an FSB operative

00:32.371 --> 00:34.138
with the Special Activities
Directorate,

00:34.275 --> 00:35.706
trained with the SVR.

00:35.843 --> 00:37.506
Name is Olga Akarova.

00:37.611 --> 00:39.131
She's one of their best,
the real deal.

00:39.246 --> 00:41.848
Annie, there is
an FSB assassin in the mix.

00:41.949 --> 00:44.450
The reason I'm here is to make
sure nothing happens to you.

00:44.585 --> 00:46.119
I know you're not Interpol.

00:46.253 --> 00:47.554
You don't know anything.

00:49.089 --> 00:51.891
We're on the same side.

00:51.992 --> 00:54.594
Easy.

00:54.728 --> 00:56.062
Agh!

00:58.000 --> 01:04.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:19.895 --> 01:22.029
Pete...

01:24.266 --> 01:26.134
You around?

01:33.909 --> 01:36.344
Auggie.

01:44.586 --> 01:46.854
Pete, where the hell are you?

02:05.340 --> 02:06.607
Walker, it's me.

02:06.742 --> 02:08.042
Pete blew through
his check-in protocols,

02:08.143 --> 02:09.342
and Auggie's not
answering his door,

02:09.478 --> 02:11.712
so just call me back
as soon as you get this, okay?

02:17.119 --> 02:19.887
Shit.

02:21.757 --> 02:24.258
Ryan McQuaid for Joan Campbell.
It's urgent.

02:34.803 --> 02:36.537
What do you mean
"we're on the same side"?

02:36.638 --> 02:38.478
I mean if you're going
to keep chasing Belenko,

02:38.540 --> 02:39.740
we might as well
be working together.

02:39.842 --> 02:40.842
Come on, we need to go.

02:40.876 --> 02:42.643
Why is the FSB
chasing Belenko?

02:42.778 --> 02:44.145
They're not.
Let's get to the car.

02:44.279 --> 02:45.880
Yeah, so you can put
a bullet in my head?

02:46.014 --> 02:47.014
No, thanks.

02:47.149 --> 02:48.950
If I wanted to kill you,

02:49.084 --> 02:51.619
you would be dead.

02:51.720 --> 02:53.855
I need your help putting
a bullet in Belenko's head.

02:53.989 --> 02:56.123
Why are you working
outside your agency?

02:56.258 --> 02:57.992
Because when I warned them
about Belenko,

02:58.093 --> 02:59.560
they turned a blind eye,

02:59.695 --> 03:01.195
so I'm eliminating him myself.

03:01.296 --> 03:02.597
You're never gonna touch him.

03:02.731 --> 03:04.851
He doesn't go anywhere
without a full security detail.

03:04.933 --> 03:06.667
Only for official events,

03:06.768 --> 03:09.136
but maybe not when he's
meeting someone illicitly,

03:09.271 --> 03:10.438
like Shumer.

03:12.875 --> 03:14.976
Look, you've gotten
this far without me.

03:15.110 --> 03:16.544
Why loop me in now?

03:16.678 --> 03:19.447
We can both go to Frankfurt
and step on each other's toes,

03:19.581 --> 03:21.916
or we could get in the car
right now

03:22.050 --> 03:23.618
and take him out together.

03:29.958 --> 03:32.193
Let's go.

03:32.327 --> 03:33.895
Do you have any idea
who this guy is

03:33.996 --> 03:35.956
that Belenko is meeting, Shumer?

03:35.957 --> 03:37.346
Maybe a courier,
or a financier.

03:38.233 --> 03:39.500
We need to get
the passenger manifest

03:39.635 --> 03:42.169
for all planes and trains
arriving in Frankfurt today.

03:42.304 --> 03:43.704
We I.D. everyone named Shumer,

03:43.839 --> 03:46.239
and then we see if we can spot
a match at the Lindauer Hotel.

03:46.308 --> 03:48.876
I like the way you think,
but I'm way ahead of you.

03:49.011 --> 03:50.177
Where did you get
this information?

03:50.312 --> 03:51.345
I thought you were
working alone.

03:51.480 --> 03:52.813
My old handler at the FSB

03:52.948 --> 03:55.182
still gives me Intel
and resources when I need them.

03:55.317 --> 03:56.517
We worked together
for so long.

03:56.618 --> 03:57.818
I can trust him with anything.

03:57.853 --> 03:59.287
Sounds like a good handler.

03:59.421 --> 04:01.289
So we I.D. Shumer.

04:01.423 --> 04:03.157
We follow him to the meet.

04:03.292 --> 04:05.159
We get a clean shot
on Belenko.

04:09.965 --> 04:11.165
Do you need to answer that?

04:11.300 --> 04:13.401
No.

04:13.535 --> 04:16.003
I don't blame you.

04:16.103 --> 04:18.039
I wouldn't talk
in front of me either.

04:21.243 --> 04:23.209
Annie it's Joan.

04:23.343 --> 04:27.213
I need you to call my office
as soon as you get this.

04:27.347 --> 04:29.148
As you know from your work
in K&R,

04:29.283 --> 04:31.717
the first 48 hours
are the most critical.

04:31.852 --> 04:34.954
We have the entire department
on level one alert status,

04:35.088 --> 04:36.889
and we're mobilizing
every resource we have.

04:37.024 --> 04:38.824
Auggie's trained
for this type of situation.

04:38.959 --> 04:40.560
If anyone can pull through,
he can.

04:43.530 --> 04:46.432
Will you help me
understand something, Ryan?

04:46.567 --> 04:49.168
You and Annie
knew Auggie was in danger,

04:49.303 --> 04:51.404
yet you chose
to keep me in the dark

04:51.538 --> 04:52.872
about this Op he was running.

04:53.006 --> 04:54.941
An Op that he apparently
tried to bring to you,

04:55.075 --> 04:56.609
but he couldn't get
any traction.

05:00.247 --> 05:01.727
He should have been
at the safe house.

05:01.748 --> 05:03.449
You're right, but he refused.

05:06.386 --> 05:07.620
DST has dropped everything

05:07.721 --> 05:08.955
and tapped into
all the security-camera footage

05:09.056 --> 05:10.556
near Auggie's building.

05:12.359 --> 05:14.327
We can only get a partial
on the plates,

05:14.461 --> 05:17.229
but we're scouring
satellite footage as we speak,

05:17.331 --> 05:19.498
trying to piece together
the van's escape route.

05:19.633 --> 05:22.168
What about the assailants--
any clear visuals?

05:22.302 --> 05:25.871
Well, one of them
is still a question mark...

05:26.006 --> 05:32.361
But the other one...

05:32.462 --> 05:35.431
is Allen Langer,

05:35.565 --> 05:36.965
your former employee.

05:37.067 --> 05:39.267
That explains how he was able
to take my operative down.

05:39.369 --> 05:41.336
Langer knows
the security protocols.

05:41.471 --> 05:44.373
We found the van.

05:44.507 --> 05:47.943
We tracked it to a warehouse
in Baltimore.

05:48.078 --> 05:49.918
It pulls in, but it never
comes back out again.

05:50.046 --> 05:51.580
I want a TAC team there now.

05:51.681 --> 05:54.917
I'll run point on the ground.

05:55.051 --> 05:56.285
I'm coming with you.

05:56.419 --> 05:58.374
This is an Agency operation.
I'll keep you apprised.

05:58.375 --> 06:00.046
My operative is out there.

06:00.562 --> 06:02.070
I'm coming with you.

06:27.751 --> 06:28.951
Clear!

06:34.524 --> 06:35.524
To your left.

06:37.727 --> 06:38.927
Clear.

06:41.231 --> 06:43.132
- All clear.
- Open the doors.

06:52.742 --> 06:54.343
Ma'am...

06:54.444 --> 06:55.811
We found a body.

07:08.892 --> 07:10.425
Let me through.

07:17.400 --> 07:18.801
That's Pete...

07:18.935 --> 07:20.602
My operative.

07:20.737 --> 07:22.971
I'm sorry.

07:23.106 --> 07:24.106
We should drag the port

07:24.174 --> 07:26.108
and see if we can find
anything else.

07:29.746 --> 07:31.480
Auggie's not here.

07:33.817 --> 07:37.636
They didn't bring him here
to kill him.

07:37.770 --> 07:39.571
They put him on a boat.

07:40.385 --> 07:44.385

07:49.623 --> 07:51.324
Hey, Auggie, it's me.

07:51.458 --> 07:53.226
I can't reach Joan or Ryan.

07:53.360 --> 07:55.795
Call me back.

08:04.838 --> 08:06.406
Hey, what about these guys?

08:09.109 --> 08:11.578
Maybe Belenko's meeting
with these two guys?

08:11.712 --> 08:13.479
Any matches?

08:15.649 --> 08:18.284
No, not yet.

08:18.419 --> 08:21.521
Wait.

08:21.655 --> 08:23.122
This has to be him.

08:23.257 --> 08:25.925
Brian Shumer, just got
off a plane from America.

08:26.060 --> 08:27.527
That's him.

08:27.661 --> 08:28.928
Okay, I'm on it.

08:29.063 --> 08:31.231
He's a neurologist,
or he used to be.

08:31.332 --> 08:33.198
Lost his medical license
three years ago.

08:33.333 --> 08:35.534
Why is Belenko meeting
with a guy like this?

08:44.245 --> 08:47.981
I, uh--I got to take this.
I'll catch up.

08:49.982 --> 08:51.715
Ryan, what's up?

08:51.717 --> 08:54.051
Annie, Auggie's been taken.

08:57.790 --> 08:58.790
"T-taken"?

08:58.791 --> 08:59.790
Allen Langer and another guy

08:59.792 --> 09:01.592
broke into his apartment
last night,

09:01.594 --> 09:02.660
and they attacked him.

09:02.662 --> 09:03.794
What about your operative?

09:03.796 --> 09:05.596
I thought he was
supposed to be protecting him.

09:05.598 --> 09:06.930
They killed Pete.

09:06.932 --> 09:10.067
Now, we think that they're
keeping Auggie alive.

09:10.069 --> 09:11.368
The theory right now

09:11.370 --> 09:12.770
is that they put him
on a shipping container

09:12.772 --> 09:14.405
and smuggled him
out of the country.

09:14.407 --> 09:15.739
Okay, well, we need
to stop all the ships

09:15.741 --> 09:16.907
and check the containers.

09:16.909 --> 09:18.909
Eight ships passed through
since Auggie was taken.

09:18.911 --> 09:21.045
That's 25,000 containers.

09:21.047 --> 09:22.579
Even if Langley
gets the clearance

09:22.581 --> 09:24.348
to search all of them, then...

09:24.350 --> 09:26.016
That'll take weeks.

09:26.018 --> 09:28.519
Once the ship
hit international waters,

09:28.521 --> 09:30.521
they could have transferred him
to another vessel.

09:30.523 --> 09:32.022
They could have put him
on a helicopter.

09:32.024 --> 09:33.624
I mean, he could be
anywhere by now.

09:37.630 --> 09:38.896
I'm sorry, Annie.

09:38.898 --> 09:40.798
I thought we could protect him.

09:40.800 --> 09:42.666
Well...

09:42.668 --> 09:45.336
We--we can't stop.
We have to find him, Ryan.

09:45.338 --> 09:48.505
I know. We're doing
everything we can.

09:48.507 --> 09:50.808
Where are you right now?
I'm Frankfurt.

09:50.810 --> 09:52.943
We're tracking Belenko.
He has a meeting here today.

09:52.945 --> 09:54.812
You're tracking Belenko?

09:54.814 --> 09:58.048
Yeah, and if anyone
knows where Auggie is, it's him.

09:58.050 --> 09:59.616
What do you need?
I can put a team together.

09:59.618 --> 10:00.984
We could have them
on the ground with you

10:00.986 --> 10:03.954
in a matter of hours.

10:03.956 --> 10:06.023
No, more people will only
make this more difficult.

10:06.025 --> 10:07.791
I don't have a lot of time.

10:07.793 --> 10:09.393
Okay, but if you need
anything, you just--

10:09.395 --> 10:12.529
Call you.

10:17.103 --> 10:18.736
Okay, change of plans.

10:18.738 --> 10:21.472
We're not gonna kill Belenko.

10:21.474 --> 10:23.741
We're gonna black-bag him
and make him talk.

10:25.678 --> 10:27.878
We came here
to kill Belenko--

10:27.880 --> 10:29.413
in and out,
no complications.

10:29.415 --> 10:31.382
- Well, now I need him alive.
- Why?

10:31.384 --> 10:35.119
Because he captured my friend,
and I want him back.

10:35.121 --> 10:37.554
Getting close enough
to Belenko to kill him

10:37.556 --> 10:39.123
is challenge enough.

10:39.125 --> 10:40.758
Getting close enough
to grab him,

10:40.760 --> 10:43.394
it's not possible.

10:43.396 --> 10:45.529
The last time I saw Belenko,
he had a tremor in his hand,

10:45.531 --> 10:47.164
and now we know this guy Shumer
is a doctor.

10:47.166 --> 10:50.634
He must be providing him
some kind of medical treatment.

10:50.636 --> 10:53.537
If we can turn him,
he can get us access.

10:53.539 --> 10:55.005
He's our in.

10:56.976 --> 10:58.108
Fine.

10:58.110 --> 11:00.544
You make the approach.

11:00.546 --> 11:01.845
But if it doesn't work,

11:01.847 --> 11:04.548
we eliminate him
before he can warn Belenko.

11:21.066 --> 11:23.801
Dr. Shumer?

11:23.803 --> 11:26.670
I'd like to speak to you
about Aleksandre Belenko.

11:30.543 --> 11:32.876
Even if Belenko
is keeping Auggie alive,

11:32.878 --> 11:35.179
the chance of recovering him
safely goes down every minute.

11:35.181 --> 11:37.114
We need to move fast.

11:37.116 --> 11:39.049
Annie expects to have eyes
on Belenko soon,

11:39.051 --> 11:41.018
and there's a chance that
he could lead her to Auggie.

11:41.020 --> 11:42.219
Okay, good.

11:42.221 --> 11:44.688
I want every resource
at Annie's disposal.

11:44.690 --> 11:46.056
Well,
from a tactical standpoint,

11:46.058 --> 11:48.492
she needs to operate alone
on this one.

11:48.494 --> 11:50.894
Any involvement from Langley
could disrupt her strategy.

11:50.896 --> 11:53.096
And what
is her strategy exactly?

11:53.098 --> 11:55.966
I'm sure she'll read us in
as soon as it's safe to do so.

11:55.968 --> 11:57.634
My company's had
a lot of experience

11:57.636 --> 11:59.102
with sensitive situations
like this,

11:59.104 --> 12:02.673
and sometimes a small footprint
is the best approach.

12:02.675 --> 12:03.974
I agree.

12:03.976 --> 12:07.144
We have other angles
to work in the meantime...

12:07.146 --> 12:09.046
Such as Langer.

12:09.048 --> 12:11.582
Now, you worked with him
for years.

12:11.584 --> 12:13.684
Can you think of anyone
who might be harboring him?

12:13.686 --> 12:15.152
My operatives
kept to themselves.

12:15.154 --> 12:16.887
It comes with the territory.

12:16.889 --> 12:18.622
It is possible
he got on the boat with Auggie,

12:18.624 --> 12:20.691
smuggled himself
out of the country.

12:20.693 --> 12:23.494
We did a black Ops mission
for the D.O.D. once years ago,

12:23.496 --> 12:25.562
and it involved transporting
certain operatives

12:25.564 --> 12:27.965
to some very
hard-to-get-to places,

12:27.967 --> 12:30.067
and it was in a way
that was impossible to trace.

12:30.069 --> 12:32.035
Sounds lucrative.

12:32.037 --> 12:34.104
We ended up contracting

12:34.106 --> 12:36.740
with an underground
import-export syndicate--

12:36.742 --> 12:39.109
people who can get anyone
anywhere for a price.

12:39.111 --> 12:40.944
Human traffickers.

12:40.946 --> 12:42.546
You think Langer
might have reached out

12:42.548 --> 12:43.580
to one of your old contacts?

12:43.582 --> 12:44.882
Well, it's possible, but...

12:44.884 --> 12:46.884
I didn't end things on the best
of terms with these guys.

12:46.886 --> 12:48.685
There were certain lines
I wasn't willing to cross.

12:48.687 --> 12:50.854
But I can make some phone calls
and see what I can find out.

12:50.856 --> 12:52.089
That's a good start.
Keep us posted.

12:52.091 --> 12:54.758
Okay.

12:54.760 --> 12:57.961
We need to figure out
why Belenko wants Auggie.

12:57.963 --> 13:00.297
I've got Arthur heading a team
at McQuaid Security

13:00.299 --> 13:03.100
analyzing metadata
from the D.O.D. and D.I.A.,

13:03.102 --> 13:05.802
trying to find link between
Belenko and Auggie's unit.

13:05.804 --> 13:07.671
And I'm willing to bet the FSB
knows a lot more

13:07.673 --> 13:09.239
about this guy than we do.

13:09.241 --> 13:11.041
What are you suggesting?

13:11.043 --> 13:13.176
Sydney's in deep
with Mashkov now.

13:13.178 --> 13:15.045
Maybe we can use her
to gain access

13:15.047 --> 13:16.580
to the FSB's files.

13:16.582 --> 13:18.549
Well, if we do that,
we better do it fast.

13:18.551 --> 13:20.017
Mashkov finds out
we've been watching--

13:20.019 --> 13:21.118
No, what I'm saying is,

13:21.120 --> 13:23.554
I think it's time
he did find out.

13:25.090 --> 13:26.090
Who are you?

13:26.091 --> 13:28.692
Did, uh--
did Belenko send you?

13:28.694 --> 13:31.662
You don't ask the questions.
You're gonna do what I say.

13:31.664 --> 13:33.096
Absolutely not.

13:33.098 --> 13:34.865
You try and walk away now,
and I'll tell him

13:34.867 --> 13:37.000
that we are working together
to have him assassinated.

13:39.038 --> 13:40.704
I don't--
I don't even know you.

13:40.706 --> 13:41.972
Belenko does.

13:41.974 --> 13:43.707
He knows I'm looking for him.

13:43.709 --> 13:46.209
If I show him these photos...

13:46.211 --> 13:48.579
Of you and I speaking,

13:48.581 --> 13:50.180
he'll probably kill you
himself.

13:50.182 --> 13:53.817
You know what he's like,
don't you, Brian?

13:53.819 --> 13:56.320
You don't want to go
down that road.

13:58.958 --> 14:01.858
I never should have agreed
to help him in the first place.

14:01.860 --> 14:03.961
What are you
treating him for?

14:05.731 --> 14:08.231
It's a neurodegenerative
disease similar to A.L.S.

14:08.233 --> 14:10.033
He approached me
a couple of years ago.

14:10.035 --> 14:12.202
After you lost your license?

14:12.204 --> 14:14.104
He--he'd heard
that I'd been experimenting

14:14.106 --> 14:16.807
with certain treatments that
were still in the testing phase,

14:16.809 --> 14:19.042
you know, prescribing drugs
before they were...

14:19.044 --> 14:20.844
approved for market.

14:20.846 --> 14:23.180
I was--
I was out of a job, okay?

14:23.182 --> 14:24.781
Now I can't get
away from this guy.

14:27.119 --> 14:30.988
What is this meeting--
some kind of checkup?

14:30.990 --> 14:33.690
I administer
a regular spinal injection.

14:33.692 --> 14:35.959
It's not the miracle cure
he was hoping for,

14:35.961 --> 14:39.663
but it alleviates the symptoms.

14:39.665 --> 14:41.398
You have your medical kit
with you, don't you?

14:41.400 --> 14:42.666
Yeah.

14:42.668 --> 14:44.101
Do you have
an intravenous agent,

14:44.103 --> 14:46.136
like Ketamine or Propofol?

14:46.138 --> 14:48.639
- Why, you gonna drug him?
- No.

14:48.641 --> 14:49.840
You are.

14:54.781 --> 14:57.215
We have to hurry.
It's almost time.

14:57.217 --> 14:59.283
You have to switch out
the injection.

15:02.389 --> 15:04.555
How many bodyguards
does Belenko usually bring--

15:04.557 --> 15:07.492
a full detail?

15:07.494 --> 15:09.360
No, he's very private
about his illness.

15:09.362 --> 15:13.164
He only brings a couple guys,
and they wait outside.

15:13.166 --> 15:15.366
How are you gonna get
past them?

15:21.775 --> 15:23.674
I'm not.

15:23.676 --> 15:25.610
I'm gonna rent
the room next door.

15:44.297 --> 15:47.665
- Did you get a hold of Mashkov?
- He just called me back.

15:47.667 --> 15:49.734
We're meeting up
during his lunch hour.

15:49.736 --> 15:52.703
You sure he wasn't spooked?
You just saw him last night.

15:52.705 --> 15:54.772
I think last night
is all the more reason

15:54.774 --> 15:56.808
why he said yes.

16:02.248 --> 16:04.115
Hey...

16:04.117 --> 16:05.683
What I'm doing...

16:05.685 --> 16:07.418
It's important, right?

16:07.420 --> 16:11.255
It was important when it was
a matter of national security.

16:11.257 --> 16:12.690
Now it's a matter
of life or death,

16:12.692 --> 16:14.325
and the clock is ticking.

16:14.327 --> 16:17.228
Thanks to the hot-sync
you did on Mashkov's phone,

16:17.230 --> 16:18.796
we know he's got
a meeting this afternoon

16:18.798 --> 16:20.631
with a group
of high-level Russian officials.

16:20.633 --> 16:22.767
Okay.

16:30.110 --> 16:32.877
What I need you to do...

16:32.879 --> 16:35.513
Is put this in his clothes

16:35.515 --> 16:37.315
so we can get ears on him.

16:37.317 --> 16:38.649
Not a problem.

16:38.651 --> 16:40.585
I can do it
while he's taking a shower.

16:40.587 --> 16:42.820
Okay.
Be careful.

17:03.476 --> 17:04.575
Hey!

17:08.414 --> 17:12.215
- Can I help you?
- I'm looking for Danny Vostis.

17:12.218 --> 17:14.519
Foreman's inside if you got
a question about a shipment.

17:14.521 --> 17:15.786
I'm not asking
for the Foreman.

17:15.788 --> 17:18.489
I'm asking
for the guy in charge.

17:18.491 --> 17:20.258
Can't help you, buddy.

17:26.699 --> 17:27.932
Isn't it amazing

17:27.934 --> 17:30.268
what falls out of people's
pockets at the shipyard?

17:32.539 --> 17:33.871
Look, buddy...

17:33.873 --> 17:36.507
I'm gonna find Vostis
one way or another,

17:36.509 --> 17:37.775
and some lucky son of a bitch

17:37.777 --> 17:39.744
is gonna make a lot
of easy money helping me out.

17:39.746 --> 17:41.679
Now, that could be anybody.

17:41.681 --> 17:44.448
But I think it's better
for both of us if it's you.

17:56.963 --> 17:59.797
Mm.

17:59.799 --> 18:01.532
I have to admit...

18:01.534 --> 18:04.202
I was surprised
to hear from you today.

18:04.204 --> 18:06.437
don't tell me
you're sick of me already.

18:06.439 --> 18:08.673
Quite the opposite.

18:08.675 --> 18:12.843
I was worried
I was coming on too strong.

18:12.845 --> 18:15.713
I was hoping
I hadn't scared you off.

18:15.715 --> 18:16.814
Oh.

18:16.816 --> 18:19.817
Should I be scared?

18:19.819 --> 18:21.385
Oh, yes...

18:21.387 --> 18:23.654
Very.

18:25.491 --> 18:28.292
When I like something...

18:28.294 --> 18:30.294
I don't let go easy.

18:35.835 --> 18:37.568
I'm sorry.
I have to go.

18:37.570 --> 18:40.271
I can't stay.

18:40.273 --> 18:42.540
What are you doing?

18:42.542 --> 18:45.276
Aren't you gonna hop
in the shower?

18:45.278 --> 18:47.712
Hmm?

18:50.350 --> 18:53.017
Oh, no, I can't.

18:53.019 --> 18:54.952
Stop.
Ooh!

18:54.954 --> 18:57.488
I have meeting I forgot about.

19:00.693 --> 19:03.561
Here, let me help you.

19:08.668 --> 19:11.636
We don't want your colleagues
getting suspicious.

19:13.006 --> 19:15.573
No.

19:15.575 --> 19:17.675
We don't want that.

19:33.459 --> 19:36.427
Is everything in place?

19:36.429 --> 19:38.729
Almost.

19:49.809 --> 19:51.976
He's here.

19:51.978 --> 19:53.978
He's with two men.

20:00.620 --> 20:01.686
Okay...

20:01.688 --> 20:03.688
It's time.
You ready?

20:03.690 --> 20:04.889
Uh, what if he
suspects something?

20:04.891 --> 20:07.525
Just act like it's
any other appointment.

20:07.527 --> 20:09.660
Once he's out cold,
you signal the camera,

20:09.662 --> 20:11.395
you unlock your side
of the door,

20:11.397 --> 20:13.798
and I'll come
and help you carry him out.

20:13.800 --> 20:14.865
Okay.

20:20.807 --> 20:22.073
Thank you.

20:26.846 --> 20:29.480
They're going upstairs now.

20:29.482 --> 20:30.781
Okay?

20:56.909 --> 20:58.709
Aleksandre.

21:51.798 --> 21:54.732
Let's get on with it.

22:02.708 --> 22:06.510
Any, uh, changes
to your symptoms?

22:06.512 --> 22:09.013
Tremors are getting worse.

22:09.015 --> 22:13.717
I'm having trouble
with my dexterity--

22:13.719 --> 22:18.589
unbuttoning,
unlocking doors, et cetera.

22:18.591 --> 22:20.191
Well, the drugs
can only do so much.

22:20.193 --> 22:22.026
Not another lecture,
doctor, please.

22:22.028 --> 22:23.594
I'm aware of the risks.

22:23.596 --> 22:25.029
Let's begin.

22:36.809 --> 22:38.776
Is there a problem, Doctor?

22:38.778 --> 22:41.178
No, no, just, uh...

22:41.180 --> 22:42.847
Okay, here--here we go.

22:54.827 --> 22:56.794
I can read people,
Dr. Shumer.

22:56.796 --> 22:58.496
It's one of my many skills.

22:58.498 --> 23:00.130
Aah! Aah!

23:02.201 --> 23:04.869
Oh!

23:14.247 --> 23:17.915
Shumer's room, now.

23:53.052 --> 23:54.052
Let's go.

24:06.666 --> 24:09.633
I have a safe house nearby.
We can take him there.

24:17.677 --> 24:19.643
Hey, no, no, no, no.
You're not going with us.

24:19.645 --> 24:20.945
You said
you were gonna protect me.

24:20.947 --> 24:22.246
Yeah, don't worry.

24:22.248 --> 24:23.981
Belenko's not gonna
bother you anymore.

24:23.983 --> 24:25.749
What if he's got more guys?
They'll kill me!

24:25.751 --> 24:28.152
You need to get in a cab
and get as far away from us

24:28.154 --> 24:29.853
as you can.

24:33.593 --> 24:35.926
No, Olga...

24:38.097 --> 24:40.598
Get in the car.

25:09.929 --> 25:11.128
Get off me!

25:23.142 --> 25:24.274
We don't have time

25:24.276 --> 25:26.644
for the whole
"good cop, bad cop" routine.

25:26.646 --> 25:29.279
This is quick cop.

25:32.418 --> 25:35.419
Is this about the girl?

25:35.421 --> 25:38.822
You people already tried
to book me for solicitation.

25:38.824 --> 25:41.892
You two are going to be
in much more trouble than me.

25:41.894 --> 25:45.162
We're not the police
or the feds, you piece of shit.

25:45.164 --> 25:46.730
We're not interested in that.

25:46.732 --> 25:48.666
We are interested, though,

25:48.668 --> 25:51.769
in telling the FSB you've
been selling secrets to us.

25:51.771 --> 25:53.437
Ha!

25:53.439 --> 25:54.738
Go to hell.

25:54.740 --> 25:56.407
I would never betray
my country.

25:56.409 --> 25:58.275
Oh, but you already have.

26:03.849 --> 26:06.283
Hmm.

26:06.285 --> 26:08.419
How did you get that?

26:08.421 --> 26:12.456
We've been watching you
for a long time, Mr. Mashkov.

26:12.458 --> 26:15.693
We tapped your phone,
hacked your email.

26:15.695 --> 26:17.061
Thanks to you,

26:17.063 --> 26:20.130
we know a lot
about what the FSB's been up to.

26:20.132 --> 26:21.432
It's not possible.

26:21.434 --> 26:25.335
Your embassy's already worried
there's a leak,

26:25.337 --> 26:27.838
and we're going to tell them
it's you.

26:27.840 --> 26:30.708
Now, you can either
cooperate with us,

26:30.710 --> 26:34.044
or we can slip that recording
to your bosses,

26:34.046 --> 26:35.713
outing you as a double agent.

26:35.715 --> 26:39.183
And they'll send you
and your family back to Russia.

26:39.185 --> 26:40.951
If you're lucky,

26:40.953 --> 26:43.320
you'll end up in some gulag
in Siberia

26:43.322 --> 26:46.290
chopping wood
in sub-zero temperatures...

26:46.292 --> 26:49.026
<i> If</i> you're lucky.

27:15.254 --> 27:16.420
What do you want?

27:20.893 --> 27:23.260
After everything we did to
get Belenko out of there alive,

27:23.262 --> 27:25.362
you're gonna shoot him?

27:25.364 --> 27:27.498
Hey, I need to find my friend.

27:27.500 --> 27:29.166
- Your friend is dead.
- Excuse me?

27:29.168 --> 27:31.101
Belenko took him.
He's already dead.

27:31.103 --> 27:33.170
That's how he operates.
That's why <i> he</i> has to die.

27:33.172 --> 27:34.972
Why do you want
to kill Belenko?

27:34.974 --> 27:37.040
I told you--so he'll stop
killing other people.

27:37.042 --> 27:38.909
Yeah, I know, you said that,
but that's not it.

27:38.911 --> 27:40.310
It feels personal.

27:43.382 --> 27:45.783
A year ago,
Belenko approached me.

27:45.785 --> 27:48.018
He tried to seduce me
into helping him, and I refused.

27:48.020 --> 27:49.052
Helping him do what?

27:49.054 --> 27:50.454
I didn't let it
get that far.

27:50.456 --> 27:52.556
When I told my bosses
at the FSB,

27:52.558 --> 27:54.024
they didn't listen.

27:54.026 --> 27:56.827
He has friends in high places.

27:56.829 --> 27:57.961
So what happened?

27:57.963 --> 28:00.497
Nothing at first.

28:00.499 --> 28:03.133
And then one night
my husband, Sergei,

28:03.135 --> 28:05.135
didn't come home from work.

28:05.137 --> 28:07.571
Two days later, they found
his body on the train tracks.

28:07.573 --> 28:12.075
They said it was suicide,
but I know it was Belenko.

28:12.077 --> 28:15.479
He killed Sergei in retribution
for me reporting him.

28:17.349 --> 28:20.350
I'm sorry.

28:20.352 --> 28:23.520
I used to send him
a postcard

28:23.522 --> 28:27.124
from every city
I traveled to for work.

28:30.296 --> 28:33.363
I can't seem to break
the habit.

28:33.365 --> 28:36.300
I promise that as soon
as we are done with Belenko,

28:36.302 --> 28:38.535
you can have him to do...

28:38.537 --> 28:41.471
Whatever you want
to do with him.

28:41.473 --> 28:44.174
But first, I need answers.

28:54.186 --> 28:56.086
How did you find this place?

28:56.088 --> 28:58.388
The flat belongs to
the parents of a friend of mine.

28:58.390 --> 29:00.958
They're never here.
We can stay as long as we need.

29:32.191 --> 29:34.024
Ms. Walker...

29:36.562 --> 29:39.263
Mrs. Akarova...

29:39.265 --> 29:41.365
Or should I say "miss"?

29:44.470 --> 29:46.570
How long do you really think
you can keep me here?

29:46.572 --> 29:48.272
As long as it takes.

29:51.911 --> 29:54.344
So, if I were you,
I'd start talking.

29:58.526 --> 30:00.393
I'm gonna make this
really simple for you.

30:01.509 --> 30:04.276
All you have to do
is tell me one thing--

30:04.278 --> 30:06.579
where is Auggie Anderson?

30:06.581 --> 30:08.214
It's quite impressive,

30:08.216 --> 30:10.683
this stunt you've managed
to pull off, ladies--

30:10.685 --> 30:14.620
bold, yet calculated.

30:14.622 --> 30:17.590
It'll be a shame to see you die
for such ingenuity.

30:17.592 --> 30:20.292
I wouldn't be worried
about us right now.

30:20.294 --> 30:22.494
Oh, I'm not worried.

30:22.496 --> 30:24.697
Worry implies uncertainty,

30:24.699 --> 30:27.366
and I have more power
and more friends

30:27.368 --> 30:28.901
than you seem to realize.

30:30.638 --> 30:34.373
You didn't get
your regular injection today.

30:37.411 --> 30:38.877
That must be hard,

30:38.879 --> 30:41.880
having to cope with your...

30:41.882 --> 30:43.482
condition.

30:43.484 --> 30:44.984
And how
is your condition, Annie?

30:44.986 --> 30:46.785
Is your heart
slowing you down?

30:49.523 --> 30:51.023
Where's Auggie Anderson?

30:53.761 --> 30:58.397
I'm sorry, but I don't know
who that is.

30:58.399 --> 31:00.699
I know why you rushed
to poison Tony Salgado

31:00.701 --> 31:03.702
after your motorcade plan
went sideways.

31:06.440 --> 31:07.906
You're not usually that sloppy.

31:10.378 --> 31:13.545
But you're running out of time.

31:13.547 --> 31:14.913
You're dying.

31:14.915 --> 31:18.017
A man who lives fully
is prepared to die at any time.

31:18.019 --> 31:21.654
An American writer, I think,
said that.

31:21.656 --> 31:23.756
Where is Auggie Anderson?

31:25.059 --> 31:27.359
Go ahead, do it!
Do it, Annie!

31:27.361 --> 31:29.028
Do it!

31:31.299 --> 31:33.699
Come.

31:37.905 --> 31:40.039
You have to let me talk to him.
Are you kidding?

31:40.041 --> 31:41.907
You will kill him.

31:41.909 --> 31:44.376
If you believe I will,
maybe Belenko does too.

31:44.378 --> 31:45.577
Let's use it.

31:45.579 --> 31:46.945
If he provokes you,
you'll lash out.

31:46.947 --> 31:49.081
I'm putting my friend's life
in your hands.

31:49.083 --> 31:50.449
You know this is the only way

31:50.451 --> 31:51.917
you're going to get anything
out of him.

31:51.919 --> 31:54.353
I'm asking you to trust me.

31:55.790 --> 31:58.090
Okay.

31:58.092 --> 32:00.359
You're up.

32:00.361 --> 32:02.328
Oh, good.

32:14.975 --> 32:17.976
Give me two.

32:37.365 --> 32:40.399
Danny Vostis,
long time no see.

32:40.401 --> 32:41.867
What the hell do you want,
McQuaid?

32:41.869 --> 32:43.936
What I want is a guy
named Allen Langer.

32:43.938 --> 32:45.537
Might have been trying
to leave the country in a hurry

32:45.539 --> 32:46.739
sometime in the last 24 hours.

32:46.741 --> 32:47.941
You heard anything about that?

32:47.942 --> 32:50.542
Even if I did,
I wouldn't tell you shit.

32:54.115 --> 32:55.948
How do you think
I found you here, Vostis, huh?

32:55.950 --> 32:57.549
Any one of your guys

32:57.551 --> 32:59.952
can be bought for less
than you paid for those shoes.

32:59.954 --> 33:01.520
How's that for loyalty?

33:01.522 --> 33:04.390
Now, I know that you have a wife
and two daughters

33:04.392 --> 33:07.626
hidden in the suburbs
where you think they're safe.

33:07.628 --> 33:08.994
How much do you think
it's gonna cost me

33:08.996 --> 33:10.596
to find out
where they are right now, huh--

33:10.598 --> 33:12.664
five grand?
Ten, if you're lucky?

33:15.803 --> 33:18.937
I can take everything from you.

33:18.939 --> 33:21.006
So either you tell me
what you know about Langer,

33:21.008 --> 33:23.041
or we can find out
what my money can buy.

33:26.680 --> 33:29.948
Have you ever lost
someone you loved...

33:29.950 --> 33:31.884
Violently...

33:31.886 --> 33:33.685
Suddenly?

33:33.687 --> 33:36.054
I doubt it.

33:36.056 --> 33:40.793
You see, the pain--
it consumes you over time.

33:42.196 --> 33:45.564
And the only thing
you can think of doing

33:45.566 --> 33:48.634
is finding the person
responsible...

33:52.540 --> 33:56.775
And making them hurt
as much as you.

34:02.783 --> 34:03.882
You killed my husband,

34:03.884 --> 34:08.085
but at least
he's not in pain anymore.

34:08.088 --> 34:10.022
I'm going to start.

34:10.024 --> 34:11.723
Aah!

34:11.725 --> 34:13.559
Aah!

34:13.561 --> 34:15.561
Mm!

34:15.563 --> 34:20.565
I will make you die 100 deaths
for killing my husband...

34:22.536 --> 34:25.003
Unless you start talking now.

34:28.007 --> 34:29.574
Where's Auggie Anderson?

34:31.178 --> 34:33.011
I'm not afraid to suffer,

34:33.013 --> 34:34.713
and I'm not afraid to die.

34:34.715 --> 34:37.483
I wonder if your friend
can say the same.

34:37.485 --> 34:39.083
Are you saying
he's still alive?

34:39.085 --> 34:40.552
For now.

34:43.157 --> 34:45.824
Where is he?

34:47.127 --> 34:48.226
Aah!

34:48.228 --> 34:49.895
Where is he?

34:57.938 --> 35:01.507
Did you find something--
anything I can use on Belenko?

35:01.509 --> 35:02.808
Walker,
where are you right now?

35:02.810 --> 35:04.843
I'm in a safe house
in Frankfurt.

35:04.845 --> 35:07.145
It's not a good time.

35:07.147 --> 35:09.615
I got Belenko.
You know...

35:09.617 --> 35:12.751
I killed your husband,
Sergei, myself.

35:14.788 --> 35:16.822
He screamed like a little girl.

35:16.824 --> 35:18.557
I was very embarrassed for him.

35:19.894 --> 35:21.093
I talked to the guy

35:21.095 --> 35:22.828
who smuggled Langer
out of the country.

35:22.830 --> 35:23.962
He was supposed to be in Grozny,

35:23.964 --> 35:25.864
but he was airlifted
off the cargo boat,

35:25.866 --> 35:27.266
and he landed in Rabat.

35:27.268 --> 35:29.067
- Where is he now?
- Well, that's the thing.

35:29.069 --> 35:30.702
I mean, he said
that something came up,

35:30.704 --> 35:32.237
and he needed help
to get to Frankfurt fast.

35:32.239 --> 35:33.839
His plane
landed 30 minutes ago.

35:33.841 --> 35:35.841
He's looking for Belenko.
We were careful.

35:35.843 --> 35:37.809
Ryan, nobody
could have tracked us here.

35:45.085 --> 35:46.218
Aah!

35:46.220 --> 35:47.819
Aah!

35:47.821 --> 35:49.788
This guy is good,
Walker, okay?

35:49.790 --> 35:51.189
You need to move
to a new location

35:51.191 --> 35:53.825
just in case this--
Okay, I'll call you back.

35:56.964 --> 36:00.032
Get your stuff.
We got to get out of here.

36:03.737 --> 36:07.039
There was a tracking device
in his mouth.

36:18.986 --> 36:20.953
Aah!

36:23.991 --> 36:27.092
Come on.

36:36.070 --> 36:38.236
You've got to make
the stairs.

36:50.084 --> 36:52.250
Come on.

36:55.823 --> 36:57.656
Check the stairs.

37:22.316 --> 37:25.317
Okay, come on, they're going.
We have to get go--

37:42.836 --> 37:44.903
Hey, hey, stay with me.

37:44.905 --> 37:46.004
Stay with me.

37:46.006 --> 37:47.372
Belenko got away.

37:47.374 --> 37:48.707
We're gonna get him.

37:51.245 --> 37:53.779
We're gonna get him.
We're gonna--

38:27.314 --> 38:29.281
thanks for sending in
a sweep team.

38:29.283 --> 38:30.716
The important thing is,

38:30.718 --> 38:32.417
Belenko confirmed
that Auggie's still alive.

38:32.419 --> 38:33.852
Yeah, but he said, "for now,"

38:33.854 --> 38:35.387
like he wanted something
from him.

38:35.389 --> 38:38.156
Then we have a window,
but it's closing fast.

38:38.158 --> 38:39.725
We leveraged a diplomat

38:39.727 --> 38:41.727
that just delivered
everything the FSB has

38:41.729 --> 38:43.161
on Belenko.

38:43.163 --> 38:45.263
Turns out our Georgian diplomat
isn't from Georgia after all.

38:45.265 --> 38:47.466
He's from Grozny, Chechnya.

38:47.468 --> 38:49.768
That's where Allen Langer
was headed.

38:49.770 --> 38:52.270
We believe that's
where he was taking Auggie.

38:52.272 --> 38:53.972
Now, if he went
to such great lengths

38:53.974 --> 38:55.440
to cover up the fact
that he's from there,

38:55.442 --> 38:57.442
he must view it
as some type of safe haven.

38:57.444 --> 38:59.411
Not only that,

38:59.413 --> 39:01.446
but Auggie's unit
was deployed to Grozny

39:01.448 --> 39:03.882
on several occasions.

39:03.884 --> 39:07.753
Annie, we still can't officially
bring you back to the agency

39:07.755 --> 39:08.887
as a field Op,

39:08.889 --> 39:11.022
but we want you
to run this mission for us.

39:11.024 --> 39:13.525
We'll contract you
through McQuaid Security.

39:13.527 --> 39:16.995
You'll have our full support
and any resources you need.

39:16.997 --> 39:21.032
If anybody can find Auggie,
it's you.

39:21.034 --> 39:22.868
Whatever it takes.

39:39.520 --> 39:41.386
I'm glad you're here.

39:42.890 --> 39:44.956
I'm glad you're safe.

39:46.326 --> 39:48.260
Let's go find Auggie
and bring him home.

40:05.145 --> 40:07.145
Auggie Anderson...

40:13.053 --> 40:15.821
I've been waiting for you.

40:15.823 --> 40:17.489
Why did you bring me
out here?

40:19.293 --> 40:21.560
Why don't you just kill me
like the rest of them?

40:23.397 --> 40:25.931
Because you have
something I want.
