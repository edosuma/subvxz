{\an6}I can't...?

39:43.506 --> 39:46.008
{\an1}Just leave.
Please.

39:46.092 --> 39:46.634
{\an8}Please, please.

39:46.092 --> 39:46.634
{\an8}All right, babe.

39:46.717 --> 39:49.095
{\an8}I'm begging you.

39:46.717 --> 39:49.095
{\an9}I'll go.

39:49.178 --> 39:50.096
{\an8}♪ Now you say you've
made a mistake ♪

39:50.179 --> 39:53.307
{\an8}♪ Now you say
your heart's gonna break ♪

39:53.390 --> 39:56.769
{\an8}♪ It's too late to be there ♪

39:56.852 --> 39:58.938
{\an8}♪♪

39:59.021 --> 40:04.110
{\an8}♪ It's too late to bleed ♪♪

40:04.193 --> 40:07.613
{\an8}(breathing deeply)
