WEBVTT

00:00.632 --> 00:02.440
Peralta, there was a botched B & E

00:02.475 --> 00:03.742
at a jewelry store on Atlantic

00:03.777 --> 00:05.543
that just turned into
a hostage situation.

00:05.578 --> 00:07.078
They want you to be the negotiator.

00:07.113 --> 00:09.447
Oh, my God, my prayers
have finally been answered.

00:09.482 --> 00:10.649
You prayed for a hostage situation?

00:10.684 --> 00:12.250
Yes, I did. Every single day.

00:12.285 --> 00:13.985
I don't understand.
Why isn't ESU handling this?

00:14.020 --> 00:16.588
Apparently, the hostage-taker
asked for Jake by name.

00:16.623 --> 00:18.356
Oh, yes, it's getting even cooler.

00:18.391 --> 00:20.025
Oh, man, I wonder who it is. Ooh!

00:20.060 --> 00:21.826
Maybe it's the brother
of someone I put away for life.

00:21.861 --> 00:24.029
Ooh! Or the identical twin of
someone I put away for life.

00:24.064 --> 00:25.797
- Ooh! Or the fraternal twin of...
- Jake!

00:25.832 --> 00:27.098
Just get down there! Take Diaz with you.

00:27.133 --> 00:28.733
Yep. Yep, yep, yep. How do I look?

00:28.768 --> 00:30.041
It doesn't matter. Let's go negotiate!

00:32.806 --> 00:34.873
Hey, everyone, I'm here.

00:34.908 --> 00:37.008
I'm Jake Peralta, the negotiator.

00:37.043 --> 00:39.511
- Oh, so you're Jake Peralta?
- The negotiator, yes.

00:39.546 --> 00:41.713
- Who are you?
- Dennis Kole, ESU.

00:41.748 --> 00:44.188
This was my crime scene
before you bozos got here.

00:44.224 --> 00:45.594
Nice to meet you too, Dennis.

00:45.630 --> 00:47.352
I've spent ten years as a negotiator

00:47.387 --> 00:49.821
and you just took
my first hostage situation.

00:49.856 --> 00:52.190
All I've done up till now is
talk jumpers off of rooftops.

00:52.225 --> 00:54.459
But that must be satisfying
in its own way, right?

00:54.494 --> 00:57.989
Yeah, really satisfying
saving a crazy person's life.

00:58.025 --> 00:59.715
Whatever. Here's a little advice.

00:59.751 --> 01:01.199
- I don't like you two.
- Not so much advice

01:01.234 --> 01:03.802
as it is a hurtful statement
based on limited interaction.

01:03.837 --> 01:05.543
He wants to talk to you.

01:06.732 --> 01:09.458
- Get the hell in there.
- Ooh, it says "negotiator" on it.

01:12.312 --> 01:14.015
This is Jake Peralta.

01:14.547 --> 01:16.158
I am unarmed

01:16.616 --> 01:18.602
and I'm approaching the building

01:20.000 --> 01:26.074
Advertise your product or brand here

01:28.128 --> 01:31.262
- You wanted to talk to me?
- Keep those hands in the air.

01:31.297 --> 01:33.365
And wave 'em like you just don't care.

01:33.400 --> 01:34.632
What?

01:34.667 --> 01:36.067
I'm just messing with you, Peralta.

01:36.102 --> 01:37.893
Put your hands down,
give me a hug, baby.

01:37.929 --> 01:38.904
Judy!

01:59.292 --> 02:00.792
Sergeant, a member of

02:00.828 --> 02:02.570
the Commissioner selection
committee is coming in today

02:02.606 --> 02:04.280
to tour the precinct
and do some interviews.

02:04.316 --> 02:05.551
Would you mind speaking with her?

02:05.587 --> 02:06.931
Of course. Terry loves answering

02:06.966 --> 02:08.265
the hard questions.

02:08.300 --> 02:09.567
Oh, here she is.

02:09.602 --> 02:11.803
I guess you don't have time to take off
those ridiculous suspenders.

02:11.838 --> 02:13.538
- What?
- Hello, Miss Sumter.

02:13.573 --> 02:14.873
Hello, Captain.

02:14.908 --> 02:16.241
I'm excited to speak to you subordinates

02:16.276 --> 02:17.976
and learn more about
your management style.

02:18.011 --> 02:20.044
I thought you could talk
to Sergeant Jeffords here.

02:20.079 --> 02:21.880
Sergeant? Oh, um...

02:21.915 --> 02:23.548
I'd rather not talk to a supervisor.

02:23.583 --> 02:25.717
I was hoping to interview
one of your detectives.

02:25.752 --> 02:28.324
Perhaps, um... him?

02:28.360 --> 02:29.621
No!

02:29.657 --> 02:32.857
- Excuse me?
- There was a wasp near me,

02:32.892 --> 02:34.559
which has since disappeared.

02:34.594 --> 02:36.628
You can interview Detective Hitchcock

02:36.663 --> 02:39.211
and I am completely fine with that.

02:40.800 --> 02:42.033
I gotta admit, man.

02:42.068 --> 02:43.902
I thought you'd be happy to see me.

02:43.937 --> 02:45.603
- Why you being so weird.
- Oh, I don't know.

02:45.638 --> 02:48.039
I didn't sleep well last night,
so I'm probably tired from that.

02:48.074 --> 02:49.808
Oh, and also,
this is a hostage situation!

02:49.843 --> 02:52.811
Wow! It's like that.

02:52.846 --> 02:54.579
Yes, it's like that. What the hell?

02:54.614 --> 02:56.047
- I thought you went straight?
- I did.

02:56.082 --> 02:57.615
I'm a high-end car broker now.

02:57.650 --> 03:00.162
I procure luxury vehicles
for the rich and famous

03:00.198 --> 03:01.305
and I do it legally.

03:01.341 --> 03:02.520
Last week I dropped off a Bugatti

03:02.555 --> 03:04.022
to the kid with the lisp
from "Stranger Things."

03:04.057 --> 03:05.890
You met Dustin? Was he cool?

03:05.925 --> 03:07.570
Do him and the rest of the gang
hang out in real life?

03:07.606 --> 03:08.893
You know what? No.
We are not chatting right now.

03:08.928 --> 03:10.161
You have three hostages.

03:10.196 --> 03:11.763
You mean Pam and the two Bobs?

03:11.798 --> 03:13.498
They not hostages. I prefer to call them

03:13.533 --> 03:15.033
"collateral friendships."

03:15.068 --> 03:16.901
I gave 'em each 500 bucks
out of my own pocket.

03:16.936 --> 03:19.003
- Thanks again, Doug.
- You the man, Doug.

03:19.038 --> 03:21.072
Actually, I'd rather
still not be a hostage.

03:21.107 --> 03:22.607
Pam hasn't come around on me yet.

03:22.642 --> 03:24.309
Tell her I'm a nice person, Jake.

03:24.344 --> 03:26.044
I'm sorry. Officer, are you
friends with this criminal?

03:26.079 --> 03:27.879
- No, not really.
- Absolutely, best friends.

03:27.914 --> 03:29.380
It's a layered relationship, Pam.

03:29.415 --> 03:31.682
- Best friends.
- Judy, get over here.

03:32.952 --> 03:34.986
- What is going on, man?
- This isn't my fault.

03:35.021 --> 03:37.956
Two years ago before I went straight,
I stole a car from a drug dealer.

03:37.991 --> 03:40.358
- Martin Halloway.
- Oh, no, Judy, he's a bad guy.

03:40.393 --> 03:42.093
I know. When I realized it was his car,

03:42.128 --> 03:43.628
I torched it along with the drugs

03:43.663 --> 03:45.463
that were in the trunk
that I didn't know about.

03:45.498 --> 03:46.931
Oh, no, Judy. Trunk drugs?

03:46.966 --> 03:48.233
Millions of dollars of them.

03:48.268 --> 03:50.034
Halloway just found out it was me.

03:50.069 --> 03:52.036
Said I had to do a job for him
to pay off my debt.

03:52.071 --> 03:53.304
But did you tell him you went straight?

03:53.339 --> 03:54.939
- Did you tell him about Dustin?
- I did.

03:54.974 --> 03:56.741
He said he doesn't watch
"Stranger Things."

03:56.776 --> 03:58.543
- Oh, this guy is the worst.
- I know.

03:58.578 --> 04:00.678
He said he's gonna kill my mom
if I don't do this job.

04:00.713 --> 04:01.980
He can't do that. I love your mom.

04:02.015 --> 04:03.881
So do I. That's why I'm here

04:03.917 --> 04:05.783
stealing this big ole bag of diamonds.

04:05.818 --> 04:07.819
Jake, you know how dangerous
this dude can be.

04:07.854 --> 04:10.155
I need you to help me save my mama.

04:10.620 --> 04:12.150
- Help you how?
- Easy.

04:12.186 --> 04:13.686
I got a plan that's good for everyone.

04:13.722 --> 04:15.093
All I need is for you to...

04:15.128 --> 04:17.228
Let him go so he can arrange
a drop with Halloway.

04:17.262 --> 04:19.096
We arrest Halloway, save Judy's mom,

04:19.132 --> 04:21.966
and Judy turns himself in,
and why is that amazing, Rosa?

04:22.000 --> 04:23.868
- Halloway's a huge crime boss.
- And what else?

04:23.903 --> 04:25.574
NYPD's been trying
to get Halloway for years.

04:25.610 --> 04:26.639
- And?
- That's it.

04:26.675 --> 04:28.072
Yeah, it is. So, since we all agree,

04:28.107 --> 04:29.507
I'll go tell Judy that the plan is on.

04:29.542 --> 04:31.876
We don't all agree.
He's trapped and desperate.

04:31.911 --> 04:33.545
Everything he told you is a lie.

04:33.580 --> 04:36.114
- Why do you say he's lying?
- That's all negotiating is.

04:36.149 --> 04:38.049
Two liars lying to each other

04:38.084 --> 04:40.351
until one liar stands
too close to the window

04:40.386 --> 04:41.519
and gets shot in the head.

04:41.554 --> 04:43.388
That can't be all negotiating is.

04:43.423 --> 04:45.056
It absolutely is. Now, get in there

04:45.091 --> 04:47.091
and coax him to a window.
Snipers to one.

04:47.126 --> 04:48.526
The window plan is on. I repeat.

04:48.561 --> 04:50.261
- The window plan is on.
- No, no, no, no, no!

04:50.296 --> 04:52.196
Snipers to zero. Snipers take a nap.

04:52.231 --> 04:54.365
The nap plan is on.
It's nap time, snipers.

04:55.835 --> 04:57.635
Amy, Gina, you came!

04:57.670 --> 04:59.571
You think I'd miss
opening day of your food truck?

04:59.606 --> 05:02.106
- I'm your biggest fan.
- Also your biggest investor.

05:02.141 --> 05:04.208
She was freaking out she was
gonna lose a ton of money.

05:04.243 --> 05:05.777
I told you that in confidence.

05:05.812 --> 05:07.278
We don't have that kind of relationship.

05:07.313 --> 05:09.380
Well, don't worry. I'm feeling good.

05:09.415 --> 05:11.182
"The One Thing" truck is ready to serve.

05:11.217 --> 05:12.483
- "The One Thing"?
- Yeah.

05:12.518 --> 05:13.751
We only serve one thing:

05:13.786 --> 05:15.787
the perfect meatball sandwich...

05:15.822 --> 05:17.889
made exactly the way Nana Boyle used to.

05:17.924 --> 05:19.791
I can't believe this
is finally happening.

05:22.338 --> 05:24.505
- Ahh!
- Uh, Charles?

05:24.541 --> 05:26.397
Sorry, I'm a bit stressed.
Jason and Jeff,

05:26.432 --> 05:28.139
the guys I hired to work the truck,

05:28.175 --> 05:29.917
called in sick so I'm all alone.

05:29.953 --> 05:31.386
What a fun opportunity.

05:31.422 --> 05:33.425
Okay, Boyle, stop freaking out.

05:33.461 --> 05:35.387
I have the day off.
I can step in and help.

05:35.423 --> 05:38.270
Yeah, me too. I'm not off,
but I come and go as I please.

05:38.306 --> 05:40.454
It's part of my charm.
I'm like an outdoor cat.

05:41.781 --> 05:44.115
ESU won't take your deal.
They think you're lying.

05:44.150 --> 05:46.284
I'm not lying.
I don't wanna be a criminal.

05:46.319 --> 05:48.186
I love my life as a average citizen.

05:48.221 --> 05:50.121
I voted for the first time this year.

05:50.156 --> 05:52.165
- Ed Breakfast for school board.
- Who?

05:52.201 --> 05:53.992
I don't know. He had a funny name.
He deserves a shot.

05:54.027 --> 05:55.560
That's why I voted for Stacy Ladle.

05:55.595 --> 05:57.428
Anyway, I'm sorry, but
they're not cutting a deal.

05:57.463 --> 05:59.130
So that's it? I gotta turn myself in

05:59.165 --> 06:01.540
- and let Halloway kill my mama?
- Actually...

06:02.001 --> 06:03.962
there might another way
to get this done.

06:04.170 --> 06:06.462
I've taken your negotiator hostage.

06:06.498 --> 06:08.665
If you come in here, I will shoot him.

06:08.701 --> 06:12.010
Just do whatever he says!
My life is in his hands!

06:13.546 --> 06:15.880
That was so much fun!

06:15.915 --> 06:17.849
Oh, man, you sounded really scary.

06:17.884 --> 06:19.083
No, no, it was all you.

06:19.118 --> 06:20.652
The tremble in your voice sold it.

06:20.687 --> 06:22.720
- "Just do whatever he wants."
- I just made that up.

06:22.755 --> 06:25.056
- Ah, I was so in the moment.
- Dude, seriously?

06:25.091 --> 06:27.892
- You are a great hostage.
- Oh, thanks, Judy.

06:27.927 --> 06:29.994
You're a great hostage taker. Whoop.

06:33.533 --> 06:35.166
Yes, sir.

06:37.112 --> 06:39.613
I can't believe Peralta
got taken hostage.

06:39.648 --> 06:41.331
The good news is...

06:42.217 --> 06:43.684
I'm the negotiator now.

06:43.719 --> 06:45.085
- Finally.
- Congratulations.

06:45.120 --> 06:47.254
I've been waiting
for this moment for so long,

06:47.289 --> 06:48.749
- and...
<i>- I'm ready to negotiate.</i>

06:48.785 --> 06:51.224
<i>But I'll only talk to Rosa Diaz.</i>

06:51.259 --> 06:53.261
- That's me, Dennis.
- Oh, come on!

06:54.463 --> 06:56.997
Okay, I think we're ready
for a practice sandwich.

06:57.032 --> 06:58.932
- Sounds good, boss.
- Please call me "chef."

06:58.967 --> 07:00.599
That's funny.

07:01.550 --> 07:02.997
- Chef.
- Thank you.

07:03.989 --> 07:07.007
Okay, see. The cut is a little slopey.

07:07.042 --> 07:08.942
I want you to cut it straight across.

07:08.977 --> 07:10.877
No big deal. Again.

07:10.912 --> 07:11.927
Oh.

07:12.547 --> 07:13.714
Uhp, slopey.

07:13.749 --> 07:15.652
Don't over think it. Again.

07:17.119 --> 07:18.685
Now you're not thinking enough.

07:18.720 --> 07:19.786
Again.

07:20.455 --> 07:22.083
Still slopey. Again.

07:22.357 --> 07:23.457
Again!

07:23.492 --> 07:24.857
You know what? Why don't we try this:

07:24.893 --> 07:26.093
Why don't you just take that knife,

07:26.128 --> 07:27.427
put it to my throat, and finish the job!

07:27.462 --> 07:28.996
- Huh?
- Do I look like Jake to you?

07:29.031 --> 07:30.364
- What?
- Do I look like Jake to you?

07:30.399 --> 07:32.165
- No, not at all.
- Then why are you trying

07:32.200 --> 07:34.167
- to screw me?
- Oh, my God, Charles,

07:34.202 --> 07:36.403
- what is going on with you?
- It's chef.

07:36.438 --> 07:38.171
You're not ready for this.
Gina, you're up.

07:38.206 --> 07:39.539
Okay, but I'm not calling you chef,

07:39.574 --> 07:41.572
- and you're not yelling at me.
- Mm-hmm.

07:43.412 --> 07:45.012
- There you go.
- Ah, thank you.

07:45.047 --> 07:47.547
No slope! A nice, straight cut!

07:47.582 --> 07:49.082
Thank you.
I felt good 'cause the knife...

07:49.117 --> 07:50.684
But you smushed the bread!

07:50.719 --> 07:52.230
It's too smushy!

07:53.254 --> 07:54.269
Again.

♪ Are you finally single? ♪

08:02.867 --> 08:04.498
- No.
- ♪ I respect that ♪

08:04.533 --> 08:06.333
Now come on in. We gotta talk business.

08:06.368 --> 08:09.022
It's so good to see you. Bring it in.

08:10.105 --> 08:11.404
Doug Judy, you're under arrest.

08:11.440 --> 08:13.073
- Wait, Rosa, stop.
- What's going on?

08:13.109 --> 08:15.100
All right, look, this is not
really a hostage situation.

08:15.136 --> 08:16.769
I mean, Pam and the two Bobs
are definitely being held

08:16.805 --> 08:18.372
against their will,
but not for much longer.

08:18.408 --> 08:20.011
Jake is helping me take down Halloway.

08:20.047 --> 08:22.022
- We can't do it without you.
- Seriously, man?

08:22.058 --> 08:24.150
This is like that story my dad
told me as a little kid.

08:24.186 --> 08:25.519
You're the frog and he's a scorpion.

08:25.554 --> 08:27.054
You're gonna help him across the river.

08:27.089 --> 08:28.794
And in the end, he'll sting you,

08:28.883 --> 08:31.450
- and then you'll both drown.
- Wow, that's dark.

08:31.486 --> 08:32.953
My parents didn't read to me at all.

08:32.989 --> 08:34.431
I just watched cartoons
till I fell asleep.

08:34.467 --> 08:35.667
Do you think that our childhoods shape

08:35.703 --> 08:37.097
- the adults we become?
- They do.

08:37.131 --> 08:38.532
And cartoons shaped you
into a naive little frog.

08:38.567 --> 08:40.267
Okay, first, little frogs are adorable,

08:40.302 --> 08:42.068
and second, he's not
that kind of scorpion anymore.

08:42.104 --> 08:43.437
I'm a changed bug.

08:43.472 --> 08:44.704
Actually, scorpions are arthropods.

08:44.739 --> 08:46.139
Amy made me watch a documentary.

08:46.174 --> 08:48.279
Look, I know he used to be a criminal
and he's fooled me in the past,

08:48.315 --> 08:50.243
and he is currently engaged
in criminal activity.

08:50.278 --> 08:51.812
Innocent until proved guilty.

08:51.847 --> 08:53.847
- But I am doing it.
- Rosa, his mother is in danger

08:53.882 --> 08:55.582
and we have to help her.

08:55.617 --> 08:57.384
Plus, he agreed to turn himself
in when this is all over.

08:57.419 --> 08:59.257
- Right, Judy?
- I promise.

09:00.377 --> 09:01.499
All right.

09:02.290 --> 09:03.637
What do you need from me?

09:03.673 --> 09:04.973
We have an airtight plan.

09:05.009 --> 09:06.793
All we demand is pizza.

09:06.828 --> 09:09.563
Hitchcock, there's a woman
here interviewing detectives

09:09.598 --> 09:11.531
a part of the
Commissioner selection process.

09:11.566 --> 09:13.200
All right, I'll go hide
in the janitor's closet

09:13.235 --> 09:15.026
until this is all over.
Thanks for the heads up.

09:15.062 --> 09:17.170
No, it's too late for that.
She wants to talk to you.

09:17.205 --> 09:19.206
What? No! How could you let this happen?

09:19.241 --> 09:21.308
- I'm nuts!
- Hey, calm down, man.

09:21.343 --> 09:22.943
We just took her
on a tour of the precinct

09:22.978 --> 09:25.612
and how she's at lunch.
That means we have one hour

09:25.647 --> 09:28.148
to teach you how to behave like a human.

09:28.183 --> 09:30.192
Oh, I see.

09:30.228 --> 09:32.886
- You're gonna "My Bare Lady" me.
- "My Bare Lady"?

09:32.921 --> 09:36.101
I'm assuming it's
a "My Fair Lady" porn parody.

09:36.591 --> 09:39.292
Oh, my. We've got our work
cutout for us.

09:39.327 --> 09:41.094
Here's our list of words to avoid:

09:41.129 --> 09:43.363
Chick, foxy, Jew, throb.

09:43.398 --> 09:44.998
Is grundle on the table?

09:45.033 --> 09:47.266
No, it's not on the table.

09:47.302 --> 09:48.668
Practice introducing yourself.

09:48.703 --> 09:51.204
Hello, I'm Detective Michael Hitchcock.

09:51.239 --> 09:52.706
Nice job.

09:52.741 --> 09:54.875
- But why are your hands so wet?
- Trick question.

09:54.910 --> 09:57.344
The answers disgusting,
so I shouldn't tell her.

09:57.379 --> 09:59.279
Just don't have wet hands, man.

09:59.492 --> 10:01.659
Hitchcock, come out.

10:01.695 --> 10:03.628
It's time.

10:05.887 --> 10:08.188
You look incredible.

10:08.224 --> 10:09.283
You bet I do.

10:09.319 --> 10:11.127
These pants really flatter my dong.

10:11.860 --> 10:13.884
What? Dong wasn't on the list.

10:14.496 --> 10:15.729
I cannot believe I didn't know

10:15.764 --> 10:17.063
you and Amy were getting married.

10:17.098 --> 10:18.565
Yeah, well, you're not exactly

10:18.600 --> 10:20.433
- an easy person to find.
- Right, right, right.

10:20.468 --> 10:21.767
I am elusive as hell.

10:21.803 --> 10:24.689
So, is there a La Creuset pot

10:24.725 --> 10:26.673
- on your registry, by chance?
- Of course.

10:26.708 --> 10:28.375
You can cook and serve in them.

10:28.410 --> 10:30.377
And it looks amazing on your shelf.

10:30.412 --> 10:32.112
What's your color of preference?

10:32.147 --> 10:33.547
French grey or mineral blue?

10:33.582 --> 10:35.415
Oh, you really do know your Le Creuset.

10:35.450 --> 10:36.683
French grey.

10:36.718 --> 10:38.518
Mineral Blue makes me want to barf.

10:38.553 --> 10:41.555
Consider it gifted.
Also, it would me my honor,

10:41.590 --> 10:43.156
- to sing at your wedding.
- Yeah, I don't think

10:43.191 --> 10:45.125
- that's gonna be possible.
- Oh, I get it.

10:45.160 --> 10:46.426
You're afraid when I open my mouth.

10:46.461 --> 10:48.295
Everyone's gonna
start smushing on sight.

10:48.330 --> 10:50.297
No, I more meant that your
probably still gonna be in jail.

10:50.333 --> 10:52.625
Damn, that's right.
I almost forgot. Tell you what.

10:52.661 --> 10:53.967
I'll record you some songs.

10:54.002 --> 10:56.269
"Kiss From a Rose"
really exploits my range.

10:56.304 --> 10:57.984
We have your food.

10:58.707 --> 11:00.974
Why are we sending him in?
One of my men should do it.

11:01.009 --> 11:03.310
It would take two of
your people three trips each

11:03.345 --> 11:04.945
to hold this much food. My guy's a pro.

11:04.980 --> 11:07.711
I've been carrying takeout
since before you were born, son.

11:07.747 --> 11:09.810
Fine, but I wanna know
what's going on in there.

11:10.118 --> 11:11.876
We're putting a camera on him.

11:14.623 --> 11:16.323
You're on camera. No audio.

11:16.358 --> 11:17.757
Thought so. That's why I'm tied up.

11:17.792 --> 11:19.492
Scully, where the pepper flakes?

11:19.527 --> 11:21.428
Will you calm down?
The food's a diversion.

11:21.463 --> 11:22.729
Although, Scully, it is crazy

11:22.764 --> 11:24.197
that you forgot the pepper flakes.

11:24.232 --> 11:25.398
Anyways, you know what to do now.

11:25.434 --> 11:27.414
What I do best. Turn my heart off.

11:31.773 --> 11:33.940
- What just happened?
- Looks like Scully collapsed.

11:33.975 --> 11:35.308
<i>What the hell?</i>

11:35.343 --> 11:36.843
<i>Your man just had a heart attack!</i>

11:36.878 --> 11:37.893
<i>Send an ambulance!</i>

11:38.546 --> 11:40.178
We're coming out.

11:42.417 --> 11:43.550
Something doesn't feel right.

11:43.585 --> 11:45.185
Why is there a sheet over his head?

11:45.220 --> 11:46.753
Because that's not our guy.

11:46.788 --> 11:48.320
- Judy's trying to escape.
- There's no way he could...

11:48.356 --> 11:49.756
All units move on the ambulance now!

11:49.791 --> 11:51.891
<i>- All units...</i>
- Move, move, move!

11:51.926 --> 11:53.592
Nice try, Judy.

11:54.663 --> 11:56.062
- Hi, there.
- Nice work, Dennis,

11:56.097 --> 11:58.365
you just caught a man
having a medical emergency.

11:58.400 --> 12:00.000
Why was there a sheet over his head?

12:00.035 --> 12:02.669
- Couldn't find his pulse.
- Yeah, it's super weak.

12:02.704 --> 12:04.838
We got movement.
Hostages are coming out.

12:04.873 --> 12:06.306
Hostages are coming out!

12:06.341 --> 12:07.474
What the hell is going on?

12:07.509 --> 12:09.276
Does anyone have eyes on Judy?

12:09.311 --> 12:11.044
Where is Doug Judy?

12:11.079 --> 12:13.713
So glad Scully put the
uniforms in with the pizza.

12:13.748 --> 12:15.382
I keep finding hidden pepperonis.

12:15.417 --> 12:17.684
Oh, man, all I got was
a pocket full of lettuce.

12:17.719 --> 12:19.586
Jake, I got you.

12:19.621 --> 12:21.596
Ooh, a garlic knot.

12:21.913 --> 12:23.269
Okay, let's ride.

12:24.488 --> 12:26.041
We'll be safe here. I know the owner.
He'd never turn me in.

12:26.077 --> 12:28.400
Yeah, I have the exact same
relationship with the guy who runs

12:28.435 --> 12:30.468
the laser tag place I love.
I mean, gun range.

12:30.503 --> 12:33.238
Peralta, who you
out here stuntin' for, huh?

12:33.273 --> 12:36.207
I love laser-T.
We gotta go sometime, man.

12:36.242 --> 12:37.642
I was hoping you'd say that.

12:37.677 --> 12:39.177
- I wasn't stunting.
- A little bit.

12:39.212 --> 12:40.512
- A little stunting.
- You stunted.

12:40.547 --> 12:42.246
A little bit.
All right, let's text Halloway

12:42.282 --> 12:44.450
- and set up the drop.
- Okay, yeah.

12:44.551 --> 12:46.684
Got the diamonds. Let's meet.

12:46.719 --> 12:48.086
Done.

12:48.121 --> 12:49.354
Okay, now we wait.

12:49.389 --> 12:51.053
Now we wait.

13:00.400 --> 13:02.767
Kind of weird, sitting silently

13:02.802 --> 13:05.136
in a private karaoke room, not singing.

13:05.171 --> 13:06.304
Yeah, but we're on a mission,

13:06.339 --> 13:07.672
so, you know, gotta stay focused.

13:07.707 --> 13:11.242

13:26.891 --> 13:28.524
The drop is set for 5:00 p.m.

13:28.761 --> 13:30.656
- Let's do this.
- Totally.

13:30.997 --> 13:33.698
Although... that is
an hour and a half from now.

13:33.733 --> 13:35.667
And the drop point is
actually pretty close to here.

13:42.715 --> 13:44.098
Order up, chef.

13:44.366 --> 13:46.010
What is this? Why are you making

13:46.045 --> 13:48.012
- six sandwiches at once?
- It's more efficient.

13:48.047 --> 13:49.681
Now we're ready
for the next five customers.

13:49.716 --> 13:51.749
Who gives a hump about efficiency?

13:51.784 --> 13:53.418
The perfect meatball sandwich

13:53.453 --> 13:56.554
is sauced exactly 70 seconds
before being served

13:56.589 --> 13:57.769
to maintain bread integrity.

13:57.805 --> 13:59.991
So sandwich number one will be fine,

14:00.026 --> 14:02.525
but sandwich number six
will be a soggy turd.

14:02.994 --> 14:05.988
Change in menu.
We're serving soggy turds now!

14:06.024 --> 14:08.148
- Get 'em while they're wet.
- Okay, I quit.

14:08.501 --> 14:09.934
Me too. You're insane.

14:09.969 --> 14:12.270
Fine, quit just like Jeff and Jason did.

14:12.305 --> 14:13.805
You told us they got sick.

14:13.840 --> 14:15.940
They got sick of hard work
just like you two!

14:15.975 --> 14:17.876
Get out! You'll never cook
in this town again!

14:17.911 --> 14:19.944
- We're not chefs!
- And you never will be.

14:21.614 --> 14:23.303
Is Hitchcock doing okay?

14:23.650 --> 14:25.683
I think so. Wait.

14:25.718 --> 14:27.629
He's bringing his hand to his face.

14:27.665 --> 14:30.054
Don't pick your teeth.
Don't pick your nose.

14:30.089 --> 14:33.057
Oh, dear, he's going to lick
something off his fingers.

14:33.092 --> 14:35.772
Oh, no, he's stroking his chin.

14:35.808 --> 14:37.258
As if in thought.

14:37.499 --> 14:38.765
Not as if.

14:38.871 --> 14:40.338
He is in thought.

14:40.600 --> 14:42.166
Oop, they're looking at us. Act natural.

14:42.201 --> 14:44.235
- Spreadsheet, spreadsheet.
- Crime, crime.

14:44.270 --> 14:46.137
- Precinct, precinct.
- Yeah.

14:46.172 --> 14:47.405
We swept the area.

14:47.440 --> 14:49.274
No sign of Doug Judy or Peralta.

14:49.309 --> 14:51.075
I can't believe that idiot thought

14:51.110 --> 14:53.211
he could just waltz in here
and do my job.

14:53.246 --> 14:55.079
It's hard to be a negotiator!

14:55.181 --> 14:58.182
My first 50 jumpers, 49 died.

14:58.217 --> 14:59.683
You only talked down one person?

14:59.719 --> 15:02.473
No, he jumped too, but he landed
on this woman who broke his fall.

15:02.509 --> 15:04.622
She died, but you can't
count that against me.

15:04.657 --> 15:06.558
- I definitely can.
- Yeah, well, save it.

15:06.593 --> 15:08.626
Peralta's the one
who got himself taken hostage.

15:08.661 --> 15:10.028
I don't think he was a hostage.

15:10.063 --> 15:12.163
He's pretty good friends
with that Doug guy.

15:12.198 --> 15:13.192
What?

15:13.412 --> 15:15.713
Diaz, what the hell is going on?

15:15.835 --> 15:17.769
First, a jeweler will come out
and inspect the diamonds.

15:17.804 --> 15:19.103
Then, when he gives the okay,

15:19.138 --> 15:20.204
Halloway will come and get them.

15:20.239 --> 15:21.540
And then I'll take him down.

15:22.342 --> 15:24.450
All right, that's the signal.
Here we go.

15:28.114 --> 15:29.447
What's up, dude?

15:33.686 --> 15:34.919
Anybody ever tell you, you look like

15:34.954 --> 15:36.716
the most interesting man in the world?

15:37.277 --> 15:38.515
You get that a lot?

15:39.620 --> 15:42.155
Jeez, I get it. We're not friends.

15:42.191 --> 15:44.191
I'll find another bocce ball partner.

15:44.464 --> 15:47.565
There he is. ♪ Halloway, it's your day ♪

15:47.600 --> 15:48.866
What's up, Mr. Halloway. How you doing?

15:48.901 --> 15:50.868
Shut up. Give me the diamonds.

15:50.903 --> 15:52.870
Man, I guess the no-small-talk policy

15:52.905 --> 15:55.039
- starts at the top.
- Come on, come on, come on.

15:55.074 --> 15:57.308
- Peralta!
- No, no, no, not now.

15:57.343 --> 15:58.610
I tracked your phone, idiot.

15:58.645 --> 15:59.943
Judy wasn't lying.

15:59.979 --> 16:01.445
That's Halloway. We gotta arrest him.

16:01.481 --> 16:03.014
- Jake, he's running.
- Come on, man.

16:03.049 --> 16:04.816
Only if I get the collar
and 100% of the credit.

16:04.851 --> 16:06.283
Are you negotiating right now?

16:06.319 --> 16:07.752
Always.

16:07.788 --> 16:09.486
Okay, that was actually
a really cool thing to say.

16:09.522 --> 16:11.311
All right, let's do it. Judy, stay here.

16:11.347 --> 16:12.472
Okay.

16:13.783 --> 16:14.882
Stop!

16:17.664 --> 16:19.497
Sorry I ran out on you
at the jewelry store.

16:19.532 --> 16:20.732
I just couldn't let this guys get away.

16:20.767 --> 16:22.100
Look, man, I'm fine with it.

16:22.135 --> 16:24.202
Arresting Halloway's
gonna get me a promotion,

16:24.237 --> 16:26.504
and at the end of the day,
that's what this is all about.

16:26.539 --> 16:29.273
Right, well, that and getting
a major drug lord off the streets.

16:29.308 --> 16:31.643
Let me give you some advice.
I don't care about that.

16:31.678 --> 16:33.111
You know, you should really
look up the word advice.

16:33.146 --> 16:34.578
I think you might be surprised
what you see.

16:34.681 --> 16:36.347
All right, let's bring in Doug Judy.

16:36.382 --> 16:37.782
Oh, no!

16:38.484 --> 16:39.851
Where is he? Doug?

16:39.886 --> 16:41.386
Don't worry. We'll get him.

16:41.421 --> 16:42.587
At least we have Halloway
and the diamonds.

16:42.622 --> 16:43.855
- Doug!
- Wait, why are you

16:43.890 --> 16:45.823
- still calling for him?
- Doug!

16:45.858 --> 16:48.426
Oh, my God, he has
the diamonds, doesn't he?

16:48.461 --> 16:51.562
Doug!

16:52.981 --> 16:54.747
I'm sure Judy didn't run off
with the diamonds.

16:54.782 --> 16:56.282
I bet he's looking for us right now.

16:56.317 --> 16:57.817
You know what, I bet he's
worried that we're in trouble.

16:57.852 --> 16:59.318
I'll just call him
and put his mind at ease.

16:59.353 --> 17:01.494
Dude, he's already gone.
He's not picking up.

17:01.822 --> 17:03.522
<i>- What's up, Peralta.</i>
- Ha!

17:03.557 --> 17:04.857
He did pick up. In your...

17:04.892 --> 17:06.791
- This is good-bye forever.
- No!

17:06.827 --> 17:09.095
Ugh, I can't believe you deceived me.

17:09.130 --> 17:10.730
I can't believe you used
my love for your mother

17:10.765 --> 17:12.265
- against me.
- I love that you love her.

17:12.300 --> 17:14.000
Of course I do. She's a living saint.

17:14.035 --> 17:16.002
<i>Amen. Look, I wasn't lying though.</i>

17:16.037 --> 17:18.097
Halloway was gonna hurt her
and you saved her life,

17:18.133 --> 17:19.872
<i>but then I was all alone
with the diamonds,</i>

17:19.906 --> 17:21.773
next thing I know, I'm hot
wiring a car and driving away.

17:21.809 --> 17:24.010
Oh, but I thought you liked
being a good citizen?

17:24.045 --> 17:25.744
You voted Ed Breakfast for school board.

17:25.780 --> 17:27.980
And he immediately had a sex scandal.

17:28.015 --> 17:29.715
- It was very disillusioning.
- For sure.

17:29.750 --> 17:32.118
Our democracy is crumbling.
But what about your job?

17:32.153 --> 17:33.583
What about Dustin
from "Stranger Things"?

17:33.619 --> 17:34.919
Famous kids are monsters.

17:34.955 --> 17:36.335
You do not wanna meet Young Sheldon.

17:36.511 --> 17:39.201
Really? Ah, that's disappointing.
He was so good in "Big Little Lies."

17:39.237 --> 17:41.093
Wait, no, we are not
talking about this right now!

17:41.128 --> 17:42.662
They could take my badge, Judy!

17:42.697 --> 17:44.884
I guess Rosa was right. I'm scorpion.

17:45.162 --> 17:46.662
Scorpion's gonna scorp.

17:46.901 --> 17:48.668
I'm sorry I can't be the man
you want me to be.

17:48.703 --> 17:50.269
<i>Damn it, stop being so romantic.</i>

17:50.305 --> 17:52.706
Now turn around
and come back to me, you fool?

17:52.742 --> 17:54.230
Hello? Hello?

17:54.266 --> 17:55.448
He's gone.

17:55.705 --> 17:57.151
He broke my heart.

17:58.145 --> 18:00.346
Now's the time where you tell
me everything's gonna be okay.

18:00.381 --> 18:02.922
- Everything's gonna be okay.
- You don't know that, Rosa!

18:03.250 --> 18:06.018
Ah, Hitchcock, I just got off
the phone with Anne Sumter.

18:06.053 --> 18:07.987
She said you really helped my candidacy.

18:08.022 --> 18:10.456
- Oh, it's my pleasure, sir.
- You were so professional.

18:10.491 --> 18:12.618
I know. I didn't even fart once.

18:12.654 --> 18:14.215
You're right. I can hold it.

18:14.251 --> 18:16.195
You know, if you can
change for an interview,

18:16.230 --> 18:18.864
- you can change for good.
- Nah, too much work.

18:18.899 --> 18:21.067
But that's not how "My Fair Lady" ends.

18:21.102 --> 18:23.573
Eliza Doolittle doesn't
go back to her old life.

18:23.609 --> 18:25.376
She falls in love with Henry Higgins.

18:25.412 --> 18:27.540
Well, "My Bare Lady,"
is a little different.

18:27.575 --> 18:29.675
It's not Eliza Doolittle
and Henry Higgins.

18:29.710 --> 18:32.345
It's Eliza DooEverybody and Leroy Pipe.

18:32.380 --> 18:33.713
And in the end, they rub...

18:33.748 --> 18:35.314
Nope. We don't need a recap.

18:35.349 --> 18:37.434
- Thank you for your help today.
- Anytime, Captain.

18:39.687 --> 18:41.253
Hey, guys. Uh, can we talk?

18:41.288 --> 18:43.022
Let me guess, you got overwhelmed

18:43.057 --> 18:44.790
and had to use
our six-sandwich technique.

18:44.825 --> 18:46.826
No, my one at a time system
worked perfectly.

18:46.861 --> 18:48.160
- Oh.
- It's just,

18:48.195 --> 18:50.029
making Nana Boyle's meatball recipe

18:50.064 --> 18:52.131
got me thinking a lot about her...

18:52.166 --> 18:54.367
And let me guess,
you realized she'd be ashamed

18:54.402 --> 18:56.836
- of how you acted?
- No, Nana Boyle was a monster.

18:56.871 --> 18:58.571
She once yelled at me so loud,
I fainted.

18:58.606 --> 18:59.788
She was a hateful witch.

18:59.824 --> 19:01.307
- She died with no friends.
- And let me guess,

19:01.342 --> 19:04.322
you realized you were acting
just like her and you felt terrible.

19:04.845 --> 19:05.878
- Yes.
- You see, Amy?

19:05.913 --> 19:07.713
You don't do "and let me guess"

19:07.748 --> 19:09.115
until you're sure you're right.

19:09.150 --> 19:11.016
Can you guys forgive me? Please?

19:11.051 --> 19:12.385
Of course, Charles.

19:12.420 --> 19:14.086
But we will never work for you again.

19:14.121 --> 19:16.522
Yeah, that's a smart move.
It's like Jekyll and Hyde.

19:16.557 --> 19:18.157
I can't control when Nana comes out.

19:18.192 --> 19:19.592
Just got off the phone with the brass.

19:19.627 --> 19:20.960
It doesn't look good.

19:20.995 --> 19:22.328
They're still trying to decide
on a punishment

19:22.363 --> 19:23.763
- for your actions.
- Well, did you tell them

19:23.798 --> 19:24.997
I feel so bad I have a tummy ache?

19:25.032 --> 19:26.399
I did. They were unaffected.

19:26.434 --> 19:28.100
They said they could have
justified your tactics

19:28.135 --> 19:30.136
if you'd come away
with Halloway and the diamonds,

19:30.171 --> 19:32.104
but as things stand,
there are no diamonds.

19:32.139 --> 19:33.739
Well, there are some diamonds.

19:33.774 --> 19:35.374
You know, the tops of engagement rings,

19:35.409 --> 19:37.209
diamond mines, but, yes,
I see what you're saying

19:37.244 --> 19:39.445
in regards to these diamonds
and it ruining my career.

19:39.480 --> 19:41.213
You're looking at
a suspension, maybe worse.

19:41.248 --> 19:42.851
Unless you can track down Doug Judy

19:42.887 --> 19:45.184
- and recover those diamonds.
- Can they wait 12 months?

19:45.219 --> 19:46.975
I usually run into him
about once a year.

19:47.254 --> 19:50.015
Wait a minute. What have we here?

19:50.738 --> 19:52.915
I've got this coupon for a private room.

19:54.128 --> 19:56.030
Yes. Right this way.

19:57.364 --> 19:59.387
We already have a song cued up for you.

20:00.501 --> 20:02.401
Judy.

20:02.436 --> 20:05.304
<i>What's up, Peralta?
Thank you so much for coming.</i>

20:05.339 --> 20:08.941
<i>Look, I thought about it
and I did you dirty.</i>

20:08.976 --> 20:10.643
<i>I never meant to cause you any trouble.</i>

20:10.678 --> 20:12.044
Yeah, well, you caused me a lot.

20:12.079 --> 20:13.706
<i>You're talking to a pre-recorded video,</i>

20:13.742 --> 20:15.548
<i>but it's cool.
I know what you're saying.</i>

20:15.583 --> 20:17.683
<i>- I hear you in my heart.</i>
- What am I doing here?

20:17.718 --> 20:20.486
<i>I feel the same way.
You my best friend too.</i>

20:20.521 --> 20:22.087
<i>Look, I'm not coming back.</i>

20:22.122 --> 20:23.722
<i>I started a new life here in San Diego.</i>

20:23.757 --> 20:25.257
Stupid telling me where you are.

20:25.292 --> 20:27.159
<i>Come on, man,
I ain't in no damn San Diego.</i>

20:27.194 --> 20:29.061
<i>Everybody knows that place sucks!</i>

20:29.097 --> 20:30.388
<i>Here's what I wanna say, though:</i>

20:30.424 --> 20:32.465
<i>I'm sorry I won't be at your wedding.</i>

20:32.500 --> 20:37.236
<i>But I did record you a CD
of original smush jams</i>

20:37.271 --> 20:39.238
<i>that will consummate the marriage.</i>

20:39.273 --> 20:40.906
<i>It's on the table next to you</i>

20:40.941 --> 20:42.544
<i>along with a little something else.</i>

20:45.679 --> 20:47.513
A French grey Le Creuset pot.

20:47.548 --> 20:49.269
<i>Now look inside it.</i>

20:49.417 --> 20:51.784
The diamonds.

20:51.819 --> 20:54.153
Yes! I cannot believe you actually

20:54.188 --> 20:56.622
- brought them back...
<i>- The diamonds!</i>

20:56.657 --> 20:58.958
- Yeah, mistimed that one.
<i>- No, you're the best.</i>

20:58.993 --> 21:01.093
<i>Look, even though I am a scorpion,</i>

21:01.128 --> 21:04.597
<i>I will never drown
your adorable little frog ass.</i>

21:04.633 --> 21:06.065
<i>So that's what I had to say.</i>

21:06.100 --> 21:08.868
<i>I'm sure I'll see you again
at some point.</i>

21:08.903 --> 21:10.369
<i>Now that coupon you got there,</i>

21:10.404 --> 21:12.524
<i>that's for a full hour
in a private room.</i>

21:13.040 --> 21:16.208
- <i>so...</i>
- So...
