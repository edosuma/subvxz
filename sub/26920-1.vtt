02:04.310 --> 02:06.572
Can we get that puppy this week?

02:06.572 --> 02:07.405
Please?

03:34.878 --> 03:36.400
- No.

03:36.400 --> 03:37.233
- No, I'm good.

03:37.233 --> 03:38.066
- Is there a teacher going to be here

03:38.066 --> 03:39.893
or should we just go ahead?

03:45.990 --> 03:47.690
- I have to leave on time though.

03:49.830 --> 03:50.663
- Okay.

05:00.009 --> 05:00.842
Continue.

06:05.319 --> 06:06.530
- You sure your teacher
wants you back next year?

06:08.182 --> 06:11.220
- It's just the first rehearsal
with the ensemble, Gila.

06:11.220 --> 06:12.910
- This is the same person that once said

06:12.910 --> 06:15.310
that he can't teach you
because you're a female.

06:16.144 --> 06:17.890
And he's what

06:17.890 --> 06:18.723
With fake hair.

06:21.880 --> 06:24.880
- He merely suggested that our
sensitivities were different.

06:27.490 --> 06:28.610
It's obvious that he's bullying you,

06:28.610 --> 06:30.220
because he once tried to bone you.

06:30.220 --> 06:31.053
And he's bitter.

06:31.910 --> 06:34.184
Why else would he teach?

06:39.994 --> 06:42.820
- I've never even been out of the country.

06:42.820 --> 06:44.570
Why would I have anything to write about?

06:44.570 --> 06:45.403
There's no plot.

06:49.512 --> 06:50.612
- I have plot for you.

06:53.230 --> 06:54.063
- Come with me.

06:54.063 --> 06:54.896
Man, Gila.

06:56.330 --> 06:57.163
Come on.

06:59.810 --> 07:01.760
Remember that high end network
I was telling you about?

07:01.760 --> 07:03.350
With the prostitutes?

07:03.350 --> 07:04.200
Escorts.

07:05.340 --> 07:06.430
What's the difference?

07:07.550 --> 07:08.910
1500 an hour.

07:10.690 --> 07:12.350
- And he calls a woman's
rights organization

07:12.350 --> 07:13.560
to brag about that?

07:13.560 --> 07:16.500
- Maybe immunity, or possibly Jesus.

07:16.500 --> 07:18.470
But if he's as important as he leads on,

07:18.470 --> 07:20.550
it's gonna lead to a nice bust.

07:20.550 --> 07:22.160
- I could go.

07:22.160 --> 07:23.450
Go where?

07:23.450 --> 07:25.265
- To meet him.

07:25.265 --> 07:26.410
No, you can't.

07:26.410 --> 07:29.460
- I'm done working on
that score and I'm someone

07:29.460 --> 07:30.293
you can trust.

08:53.719 --> 08:54.956
Are you Kim?

08:54.956 --> 08:57.206
Anything else?

08:58.360 --> 08:59.193
Another carrot?

09:23.510 --> 09:25.030
The escorts were male?

09:25.030 --> 09:26.720
You could put it that way.

09:26.720 --> 09:28.840
Only, they paid me.

09:29.890 --> 09:30.723
It's magic.

09:34.560 --> 09:36.120
They were before I quit.

09:41.680 --> 09:44.750
- The ones on the list are
those that kept me interested.

09:44.750 --> 09:46.520
I simply turned the tables on them.

09:47.353 --> 09:49.150
Isn't that dangerous?

09:49.150 --> 09:51.550
- Nothing a little pepper
spray can't handle.

09:51.550 --> 09:56.410
You see, these guys are usually
driven by one of two things.

09:56.410 --> 09:59.040
Narcissism or insecurity.

09:59.040 --> 10:01.970
It only ever becomes
tricky when it's both.

10:01.970 --> 10:05.080
- You graded your clients,
but you didn't judge them.

10:11.280 --> 10:12.130
You're a painter.

10:28.340 --> 10:29.340
These are beautiful.

10:30.640 --> 10:32.020
- He was my favorite.

10:33.590 --> 10:35.580
Quite cheesy, almost a romantic.

10:39.360 --> 10:41.780
Why are you helping the organization?

10:41.780 --> 10:43.730
- Because not all the girls are like me.

10:43.730 --> 10:45.630
Not everyone can handle this business.

10:46.550 --> 10:47.500
It's your list now.

10:48.780 --> 10:52.537
Do whatever you want with it.

10:52.537 --> 10:53.870
- Your painting!

13:02.013 --> 13:04.960
Are you awake?

14:05.971 --> 14:07.970
- Uh, 'scuse miss--

14:10.010 --> 14:10.843
- I'm sorry.

14:11.720 --> 14:12.553
- Uh Miss,

14:15.320 --> 14:16.153
have a seat.

14:24.710 --> 14:26.130
Have you an alternative option?

14:26.130 --> 14:27.540
- No, I haven't because Carl said

14:27.540 --> 14:28.890
that wouldn't be necessary.

14:29.760 --> 14:31.810
- Well even if Carl did say--

14:31.810 --> 14:32.643
- He did!

14:33.590 --> 14:35.010
- It's an emotional situation for you,

14:35.010 --> 14:38.430
but even had he said that,
his letter of recommendation

14:38.430 --> 14:41.430
is just one element among
many in your docket.

14:42.263 --> 14:43.860
- Malorie, let's be civil.

14:44.810 --> 14:46.270
Fred wouldn't be eligible.

14:46.270 --> 14:48.510
- I am not at liberty to say.

14:48.510 --> 14:51.150
- This is the one scholarship
for women composers.

14:51.150 --> 14:53.340
- That was never a set in stone policy.

14:53.340 --> 14:55.070
More of a silent guideline.

14:55.070 --> 14:55.930
Under erasure.

14:57.084 --> 14:59.210
Do you know what that term means?

14:59.210 --> 15:03.327
That refers to the problematic
nature of defining anything.

15:07.940 --> 15:12.940
But, as dean of this
department, I can tell you,

15:12.950 --> 15:15.720
the doors of this
institution are wide open--

15:15.720 --> 15:17.430
- I don't have a scholarship!

15:17.430 --> 15:20.690
And I am already paying off
my student loan until I'm 43.

15:20.690 --> 15:24.160
- You are attending one of
the most prestigious schools

15:24.160 --> 15:24.993
in the country.

15:26.280 --> 15:28.630
There should be ways for
you to acquire a loan,

15:28.630 --> 15:30.780
even at this rather
advanced point in time.

15:39.083 --> 15:40.680
Malorie, talk to me.

15:41.720 --> 15:45.270
- So, in my recommendation
letter, did you write

15:45.270 --> 15:46.690
that Malorie is talented,

15:46.690 --> 15:49.070
but that she failed to develop?

15:49.070 --> 15:51.500
That she has great technique but that her

15:51.500 --> 15:52.790
method sadly sucks.

15:53.650 --> 15:54.540
- That's exactly it.

15:54.540 --> 15:57.210
- I think you're right, I
think the piece is cerebral

15:57.210 --> 16:00.100
and irrelevant and completely boring.

16:06.110 --> 16:07.560
- The ensemble needs that.

16:07.560 --> 16:08.900
- You wanted risk.

16:08.900 --> 16:10.510
- Don't be ridiculous.

16:10.510 --> 16:13.110
Nobody writes a piece a
little over four weeks.

16:14.420 --> 16:16.410
Other students would
kill for that commission

16:16.410 --> 16:17.960
for the Schmierstein Ensemble.

16:19.050 --> 16:20.700
The Schmierstein for fuck's sake!

16:23.330 --> 16:24.450
If you don't hand your score in on time,

16:24.450 --> 16:26.640
I'm gonna have to fail you.

16:26.640 --> 16:29.870
And then, I don't know,
maybe I'll have to have them

16:29.870 --> 16:31.820
play one of my own compositions.

16:31.820 --> 16:33.840
- I'm following your advice to grow a pair

16:33.840 --> 16:36.450
and what was the other dick term you used?

16:36.450 --> 16:37.820
Be more testosteroneous.

16:59.864 --> 17:04.864
("Dance of the Sugar Plum
Fairy" cell phone ring tone)

17:50.206 --> 17:52.120
- Ya know, you don't need a degree,

17:52.120 --> 17:53.730
you can do this by yourself.

17:58.930 --> 18:00.560
Where am I supposed to go?

18:01.690 --> 18:04.760
I can't go back home with
my parents, I'd rather die.

18:11.760 --> 18:12.593
Gila's right.

18:14.200 --> 18:17.350
Women, nobody gives a shit.

18:22.280 --> 18:26.320
- You do not sound like you right now.

18:26.320 --> 18:29.490
- I don't know what I'm
supposed to sound like.

18:29.490 --> 18:31.360
You do, but I don't.

18:33.290 --> 18:36.940
- I wouldn't be an accountant
if I had your talent.

18:36.940 --> 18:38.050
It's not even--

18:38.050 --> 18:40.540
- Everyone stop saying that I'm talented.

18:42.230 --> 18:43.610
Why are you saying that?

18:50.560 --> 18:52.230
I threw out my composition.

18:57.635 --> 18:59.340
You've been working on
that since the beginning

18:59.340 --> 19:01.100
of the year, why?

19:01.100 --> 19:01.933
- It wasn't me.

19:08.820 --> 19:11.110
- Well, I mean I was there, sitting there,

19:11.110 --> 19:13.550
in the apartment writing it, it's just,

19:16.120 --> 19:19.300
Oh, rent's going up 200 bucks.

19:23.800 --> 19:24.633
So,

19:29.280 --> 19:30.710
what do you say?

19:37.243 --> 19:40.576
- I mean I, I, can cover the difference.

19:43.125 --> 19:45.042
That's not the problem.

19:50.079 --> 19:53.496
I've been hanging out with someone, else.

19:57.732 --> 20:01.467
I didn't wanna tell you when
you were writing your piece.

20:01.467 --> 20:03.699
- You were seeing someone
while I was writing my piece?

20:03.699 --> 20:05.449
- Not the whole time.

20:12.137 --> 20:13.887
I feel like an idiot.

20:21.272 --> 20:23.105
I'll go get my things.

26:20.179 --> 26:23.210
He was my favorite.

26:23.210 --> 26:26.300
Quite cheesy, almost a romantic.

27:34.280 --> 27:35.730
I contacted her to make sure.

27:38.980 --> 27:42.570
She says you're a very
special person, Malorie.

27:55.310 --> 27:56.143
- I paint.

27:57.760 --> 28:00.240
Concrete?

28:00.240 --> 28:02.160
- Apartment, white.

28:47.490 --> 28:49.280
- Wait.

28:50.830 --> 28:51.663
- You first.

29:35.418 --> 29:36.835
A shower?
- Okay.

29:39.910 --> 29:40.743
- Together.

29:45.020 --> 29:46.170
You really are special.

31:29.228 --> 31:30.378
Did you enjoy yourself?

31:36.100 --> 31:40.059
I'll pay you double if you come.

33:06.904 --> 33:11.904
("Dance of the Sugar Plum
Fairy" cell phone tone)

33:12.100 --> 33:14.200
Don't call this number again it's private.

33:50.401 --> 33:51.490
- A few short weeks.

33:52.670 --> 33:54.200
It's impossible.

33:54.200 --> 33:57.430
The ensemble is looking forward
to performing your piece.

33:57.430 --> 33:59.400
It's perfectly adequate.

33:59.400 --> 34:00.910
- Maybe they'll like my new piece then.

34:06.820 --> 34:07.653
- Texture.

34:08.650 --> 34:11.050
- Even when your bank loan
in place, if you don't have

34:11.050 --> 34:13.340
a final score, we cannot graduate you.

34:14.480 --> 34:16.380
- That'll at least make it meaningful.

34:18.040 --> 34:20.719
This time I have to find
a voice that's my own.

34:23.350 --> 34:24.699
That's what it'll be about.

34:27.760 --> 34:28.592
Agreed?

34:29.980 --> 34:33.420
And Mal, you already
look much better today.

34:34.800 --> 34:36.228
I can see it in your eyes.

34:42.060 --> 34:42.893
- Pay as you go.

34:53.530 --> 34:54.650
Make sure that you don't lose the number

34:54.650 --> 34:56.599
because it's the only thing
connecting you to the phone.

34:56.599 --> 34:57.432
- Okay.

36:22.393 --> 36:23.393
- Mm.
- Hm.

36:41.152 --> 36:42.202
I noticed your hands.

36:45.270 --> 36:47.070
Hardly the fingernails of a painter.

36:50.190 --> 36:53.760
- I gotta get my train
to be up early tomorrow.

37:06.010 --> 37:06.843
- Choo choo.

37:08.050 --> 37:08.883
Choo choo.

40:01.289 --> 40:03.456
Enjoys tights.

41:22.410 --> 41:23.480
Nice warm day today?

41:24.570 --> 41:25.470
Maybe too much.

41:38.290 --> 41:40.990
Work, too much work.

41:43.560 --> 41:44.960
I'm sure you know how it is.

41:47.620 --> 41:50.730
- Work, I mean you work
too, with your cunt.

41:59.450 --> 42:00.950
But you don't dress like them.

42:04.790 --> 42:06.190
You're like a normal person.

42:12.040 --> 42:15.330
I'm not a freak ya know.

45:33.703 --> 45:36.280
I'm not a freak, ya know.

45:38.700 --> 45:41.580
She says you're a
very special person, Malorie.

46:36.600 --> 46:37.433
For inspiration?

46:39.642 --> 46:41.730
- No, not really.

46:41.730 --> 46:43.540
- Hey, Miranda!

46:43.540 --> 46:46.460
Malorie, Malorie meet Miranda,
this is my best friend

46:46.460 --> 46:48.162
Mal, who helped us get the list.

46:48.162 --> 46:51.620
You are that girl.

46:51.620 --> 46:54.770
Oh, Gila has talked so much about you.

46:56.140 --> 46:58.670
I'm so sorry about your boyfriend.

47:04.870 --> 47:06.860
Why don't you come work for us?

47:07.693 --> 47:09.050
- Well, you've done so much for us already

47:09.050 --> 47:11.560
and I hear you might need
a little financial support.

47:14.736 --> 47:17.667
I have
to make a phone call.

47:17.667 --> 47:18.500
- Okay.

47:26.950 --> 47:28.030
- You did good.

47:28.030 --> 47:28.863
- Thanks.

47:28.863 --> 47:31.060
- Donations have really dried
up in the last two quarters

47:31.060 --> 47:33.160
and a little scandal is just what we need.

47:37.790 --> 47:38.890
- Fingers crossed.

47:38.890 --> 47:41.560
- When is this going down,
like this week or more like

47:41.560 --> 47:42.560
three or four weeks?

47:46.200 --> 47:47.810
Maybe you should come and work for us.

47:47.810 --> 47:49.430
Given that you're completely broke.

47:49.430 --> 47:50.930
The FBI has the list now.

48:00.210 --> 48:02.183
Wanna get that?

48:02.183 --> 48:03.903
- No.

48:03.903 --> 48:06.506
Yes
means yes and no means no.

48:06.506 --> 48:07.339
- It's started.

48:07.339 --> 48:08.504
wherever I go,

48:08.504 --> 48:11.105
yes means yes and no means no.

48:11.105 --> 48:13.757
Whatever I wear and wherever I go

48:13.757 --> 48:16.697
Yes means yes and no means no.

48:17.574 --> 48:18.407
- Sluts.

48:22.744 --> 48:23.827
- That's Kim.

48:25.364 --> 48:27.002
Whatever I wear, wherever I go,

48:27.002 --> 48:28.775
yes means yes and no means no.

48:28.775 --> 48:30.757
Whatever I wear, wherever I go,

48:30.757 --> 48:32.424
yes means yes and no means no.

48:32.424 --> 48:34.256
Whatever I wear, wherever I go,

48:34.256 --> 48:35.489
yes means yes and no means no.

48:36.447 --> 48:37.912
Whatever I wear, wherever I go,

48:37.912 --> 48:39.741
yes means yes and no means no.

48:39.741 --> 48:40.668
Whatever I wear, wherever I go,

48:41.501 --> 48:43.229
yes means yes and no means no.

48:43.229 --> 48:45.167
Whatever I wear, wherever I go

48:45.167 --> 48:46.000
yes mean yes,

48:46.833 --> 48:48.166
Kim!

51:34.255 --> 51:37.422
Need to get them to help us.

51:43.129 --> 51:47.212
Interesting if
like, we were going out.

55:10.432 --> 55:12.349
- Row row row your boat

55:16.930 --> 55:18.763
gently down the stream

55:20.153 --> 55:23.820
merrily merrily merrily
life is but a dream.

57:18.757 --> 57:20.174
You okay?

57:26.510 --> 57:28.340
How about an update in two weeks?

57:28.340 --> 57:29.173
Agreed?

58:26.700 --> 58:27.533
Malorie?

01:00:16.739 --> 01:00:17.572
- Hi.

01:00:25.393 --> 01:00:26.226
Shit!

01:00:32.725 --> 01:00:33.975
You smell nice.

01:00:34.995 --> 01:00:36.855
- I like your hair.

01:00:38.729 --> 01:00:39.646
Three, one.

01:00:41.961 --> 01:00:43.369
- Shit.

01:00:43.369 --> 01:00:44.959
- It's okay.

01:00:44.959 --> 01:00:46.542
Shit two three four

01:00:48.090 --> 01:00:49.340
shit two three.

01:00:50.970 --> 01:00:53.114
Shit two three four.

01:00:53.114 --> 01:00:54.560
Shit two three four.

01:00:54.560 --> 01:00:55.800
- Victoria!

01:00:55.800 --> 01:00:58.000
I explicitly asked you
to wait in my office.

01:01:00.910 --> 01:01:02.279
Malorie?

01:01:02.279 --> 01:01:04.190
What are you doing here?

01:01:04.190 --> 01:01:05.860
- I'm here for my meeting at two.

01:01:05.860 --> 01:01:06.910
- That was last week.

01:01:08.400 --> 01:01:10.200
- I'm pretty sure you said two weeks.

01:01:11.660 --> 01:01:13.870
- I did, but that was three weeks ago.

01:01:17.170 --> 01:01:18.080
What's going on?

01:01:28.240 --> 01:01:29.140
What is this?

01:01:30.240 --> 01:01:32.220
- Well you were pretty
direct with your critique

01:01:32.220 --> 01:01:33.520
and it was pretty helpful.

01:01:35.180 --> 01:01:36.013
The cliff.

01:01:37.080 --> 01:01:38.150
- Yes the cliff.

01:01:39.720 --> 01:01:42.330
- I'm staring at it, from underneath.

01:01:42.330 --> 01:01:43.870
- The beginning part I'm clearest about,

01:01:43.870 --> 01:01:46.360
but the middle and the end
I'm not quite there yet.

01:01:46.360 --> 01:01:47.340
I'm still juggling.

01:01:48.540 --> 01:01:50.290
- If you could show me
where the beginning ends

01:01:50.290 --> 01:01:51.620
and the middle starts.

01:01:53.620 --> 01:01:55.130
- I've been wondering about that.

01:02:00.365 --> 01:02:01.198
Are you even here?

01:02:01.198 --> 01:02:02.230
- Here, here, here.

01:02:02.230 --> 01:02:04.320
- All I see is a mass of random colors.

01:02:05.440 --> 01:02:06.640
You're making fun of me.

01:02:08.690 --> 01:02:10.040
- Most of it is in my head.

01:02:10.900 --> 01:02:13.670
And I'm drawing it all out on
this mindmap I'm working with

01:02:13.670 --> 01:02:15.900
so eight days is totally doable.

01:02:15.900 --> 01:02:18.110
- One. One day is what you have.

01:02:18.110 --> 01:02:20.060
- Just needs transcribing from up here.

01:02:22.120 --> 01:02:23.650
- Malorie, Malorie.

01:02:25.440 --> 01:02:28.110
What am I supposed to tell the ensemble?

01:02:28.110 --> 01:02:28.943
- Under control.

01:02:53.575 --> 01:02:55.750
I'm in place.

01:03:17.060 --> 01:03:18.300
Malorie?

01:03:18.300 --> 01:03:20.400
It's Fred from the Schmierstein Ensemble.

01:03:50.280 --> 01:03:52.060
- About the whole scholarship.

01:03:52.060 --> 01:03:52.893
- No, it's okay.

01:03:58.880 --> 01:04:00.270
Do you want some coffee?

01:04:10.490 --> 01:04:13.350
So you making
progress on that piece?

01:04:13.350 --> 01:04:15.520
Yeah, I'm working on it.

01:04:15.520 --> 01:04:16.370
I saw Carl today.

01:04:18.090 --> 01:04:18.923
- I know.

01:05:04.390 --> 01:05:06.140
- It's a mind map I'm working with.

01:05:07.960 --> 01:05:11.010
Just sounds and impressions for my piece.

01:05:20.570 --> 01:05:25.570
Manhattan, and the subway
going to Queens and Brooklyn.

01:05:31.350 --> 01:05:32.183
This is amazing.

01:05:34.090 --> 01:05:35.510
- Come here, I wanna show you something.

01:05:49.420 --> 01:05:53.320
- I'll play the main melody
and I thought the bassoon

01:05:53.320 --> 01:05:56.150
could shadow it.

01:05:57.570 --> 01:05:59.220
Shadow with what?

01:05:59.220 --> 01:06:00.070
- With the blues.

01:06:16.030 --> 01:06:17.130
Wait, hold on.

01:07:26.350 --> 01:07:27.183
Malorie?

01:07:45.940 --> 01:07:47.990
- You're lucky you were found right away.

01:07:48.900 --> 01:07:51.400
- It's just that I've
been working really hard

01:07:51.400 --> 01:07:52.710
for this deadline that I have.

01:07:52.710 --> 01:07:54.860
- You gotta tell your
boyfriend to remind you

01:07:54.860 --> 01:07:56.030
to eat next time.

01:08:00.020 --> 01:08:00.920
I don't have that.

01:08:09.360 --> 01:08:10.193
- Mmhmm.

01:08:11.680 --> 01:08:13.460
Will you agree to a test?

01:08:14.730 --> 01:08:16.819
- I don't really, I don't have the time.

01:08:16.819 --> 01:08:19.090
- It's just another one of those.

01:08:21.060 --> 01:08:25.420
Better safe than sorry, but I
am obliged to ask you first.

01:08:26.670 --> 01:08:28.689
- Well then yeah, okay.

01:08:28.689 --> 01:08:33.540
- I could prescribe some
Elavil for you or Effexor.

01:08:33.540 --> 01:08:35.130
- No thanks.

01:08:35.130 --> 01:08:40.130
- My brother's an artist,
so I know how it is.

01:08:43.660 --> 01:08:45.760
I used to play the flute.

01:08:46.979 --> 01:08:50.350
Of course, it never
really amounted to much.

01:08:50.350 --> 01:08:52.000
The passion has to be there.

01:08:53.689 --> 01:08:57.620
But with him, I know how crazy
life can be for you people.

01:08:59.470 --> 01:09:00.590
I just admire it.

01:09:02.200 --> 01:09:05.510
All that personal discipline.

01:09:13.818 --> 01:09:15.247
- Rehearsal.

01:09:15.247 --> 01:09:17.325
Man, you do look like shit.

01:09:17.325 --> 01:09:18.890
C'mon let's get you out of here.

01:09:18.890 --> 01:09:20.978
- I gotta go finish my score.

01:09:20.978 --> 01:09:23.200
- And I need to make
sure you have some fun

01:09:23.200 --> 01:09:24.910
before you die of exhaustion.

01:09:24.910 --> 01:09:25.743
Come on.

01:09:27.520 --> 01:09:29.830
- Doesn't even really feel
like sex for me at first,

01:09:29.830 --> 01:09:33.170
it just sort of feels like strange poking.

01:09:33.170 --> 01:09:35.660
I try to talk dirty, but I am awful.

01:09:35.660 --> 01:09:38.340
I don't know you sluts say these things.

01:09:38.340 --> 01:09:41.890
I'll see my mom in the room,
just disappointed in me.

01:09:41.890 --> 01:09:43.120
Like, really Rachel?

01:09:43.120 --> 01:09:44.439
Ram me harder?

01:09:44.439 --> 01:09:46.859
Is that what the girls say at school?

01:09:46.859 --> 01:09:48.319
My goodness!

01:09:48.319 --> 01:09:49.153
I'm wet?

01:09:49.153 --> 01:09:50.050
Is that what Becky says?

01:09:51.140 --> 01:09:52.200
Howard, are you listening to this?

01:09:52.200 --> 01:09:53.033
Get in here.

01:09:53.033 --> 01:09:56.580
She's on her hands and knees,
screaming ram me harder.

01:09:56.580 --> 01:09:59.620
I think you talked about
being a women's studies major

01:09:59.620 --> 01:10:00.453
at one point.

01:10:01.540 --> 01:10:03.350
I was always like an awkward kid.

01:10:03.350 --> 01:10:05.940
Nobody really explained
anything to me also.

01:10:05.940 --> 01:10:08.960
Like about sex, or being a woman at all.

01:10:09.960 --> 01:10:12.260
Oh, what happened, did
you get a text message?

01:10:13.260 --> 01:10:14.450
My parents...

01:10:14.450 --> 01:10:17.610
- This guy Fred, he's
totally in love with you.

01:10:19.680 --> 01:10:21.560
- No, ya just tell with the nerds.

01:10:22.430 --> 01:10:23.390
You're so cute.

01:10:25.480 --> 01:10:27.330
Might be good for your system.

01:10:27.330 --> 01:10:28.163
Shhh.

01:10:28.163 --> 01:10:29.936
Huh?

01:10:32.600 --> 01:10:33.970
Keep getting phone calls.

01:10:36.740 --> 01:10:38.530
Whores, it's time to settle down.

01:10:39.370 --> 01:10:41.080
I mean every once in
a while my grandmother

01:10:41.080 --> 01:10:42.180
would say something,

01:10:43.510 --> 01:10:44.860
- You look a little
pale, do you think it's

01:10:44.860 --> 01:10:47.850
time to get back to NYU
where things make sense?

01:10:47.850 --> 01:10:49.630
Oh, ya gonna leave?

01:10:49.630 --> 01:10:50.820
Are you scared?

01:10:50.820 --> 01:10:52.930
I heard Scott's having a
party at his lake house.

01:10:52.930 --> 01:10:53.763
You should go.

01:10:54.820 --> 01:10:56.310
It's gonna be amazing you guys.

01:10:56.310 --> 01:10:57.920
They're gonna do a lot of keg stands.

01:10:57.920 --> 01:11:01.320
And Scott might try to rape
you, but he always apologizes.

01:11:01.320 --> 01:11:02.470
- Hey, hey!

01:11:02.470 --> 01:11:04.670
Do you know what will happen to you?

01:11:04.670 --> 01:11:06.360
What will happen to me
if this ever gets out?

01:11:06.360 --> 01:11:08.840
You are completely
undermining Purple Justice.

01:11:12.830 --> 01:11:13.860
- Meeting up with strangers.

01:11:13.860 --> 01:11:15.650
- I would hit the first guy in the face

01:11:15.650 --> 01:11:17.150
if he ever offered me money.

01:11:17.150 --> 01:11:19.580
Lowering me with his filthy fucking money?

01:11:22.060 --> 01:11:23.560
The money?

01:11:23.560 --> 01:11:25.230
- Yes, the money.

01:11:25.230 --> 01:11:28.430
You are acting completely irrationally.

01:11:28.430 --> 01:11:30.750
Who knows what diseases you have in you?

01:11:30.750 --> 01:11:32.170
How can you even look at
yourself in the mirror?

01:11:32.170 --> 01:11:33.690
What were you thinking Mal?

01:11:33.690 --> 01:11:34.523
- I wasn't.

01:11:40.113 --> 01:11:41.770
You're just gonna do this
for the rest of your life now

01:11:41.770 --> 01:11:43.120
so you can be an artist?

01:11:43.120 --> 01:11:45.970
- No just one more night and
then I have it all together.

01:11:53.050 --> 01:11:54.020
He pays you, right?

01:11:56.440 --> 01:11:57.273
- Triple.

01:12:16.490 --> 01:12:19.830
Lemme go with
you, hide outside again,

01:12:21.200 --> 01:12:22.410
warn you?

01:12:22.410 --> 01:12:23.620
Of what?

01:12:23.620 --> 01:12:25.270
Looks like client
one is pulling the strings

01:12:25.270 --> 01:12:26.220
inside the network.

01:12:27.178 --> 01:12:29.060
They might make first arrests.

01:12:29.060 --> 01:12:30.110
Trust me.

01:13:56.643 --> 01:13:59.643
Ah!

01:14:09.127 --> 01:14:09.960
Ah.

01:15:49.915 --> 01:15:50.998
- I gotta go.

01:15:52.934 --> 01:15:55.560
Stay the night.

01:15:55.560 --> 01:15:56.393
- I can't.

01:15:58.413 --> 01:16:00.744
I'll pay you for every hour.

01:16:01.577 --> 01:16:02.577
- I'm sorry.

01:16:05.089 --> 01:16:07.006
Sorry for what?

01:16:08.021 --> 01:16:13.021
- I gotta finish something
I started when we first met.

01:16:17.319 --> 01:16:19.402
What do you mean?

01:16:22.343 --> 01:16:24.426
Malorie, what's going on?

01:16:26.994 --> 01:16:29.077
FBI, open up.

01:16:34.613 --> 01:16:35.696

01:20:50.320 --> 01:20:52.000
Otherwise you're normal.

01:20:53.060 --> 01:20:56.650
Sometimes the body acts
that way during pregnancy

01:20:58.000 --> 01:20:58.850
or for no reason.

01:21:00.690 --> 01:21:05.010
Or for no reason at all.

01:21:18.670 --> 01:21:19.503
- Ah!

01:21:36.120 --> 01:21:37.290
$48,000.

01:22:45.597 --> 01:22:48.220
- I was wondering about that painting.

01:22:48.220 --> 01:22:50.700
- 7500, that's the asking price.

01:22:53.100 --> 01:22:56.060
- Do you have contact
information for the artist?

01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:58.800
- We don't give out artist contacts.

01:23:04.020 --> 01:23:06.060
- Julia, no for Kim.

01:23:07.820 --> 01:23:09.860
- That painting's by Julia Colavita.

01:23:40.160 --> 01:23:42.750
- I would like it if she could
get this before tomorrow.

01:23:42.750 --> 01:23:43.600
- I'll see to it.

01:23:47.360 --> 01:23:48.440
Wait, who are you?

01:23:50.100 --> 01:23:54.500
- Just tell her it's
from the girl who grades

01:23:54.500 --> 01:23:55.470
but doesn't judge.

01:23:58.420 --> 01:23:59.253
Not anymore.

01:24:05.550 --> 01:24:07.750
You made it
Malorie, what a relief.

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:58.830
- Dear students, dear faculty,

01:25:00.160 --> 01:25:05.160
