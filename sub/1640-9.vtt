00:01.154 --> 00:03.006
Good morning wonderful people!

00:03.007 --> 00:07.092
You're in a good mood, so did somebody
get their pulsating showerhead fixed?

00:09.079 --> 00:10.839
I'll answer that when
you go through puberty.

00:12.682 --> 00:15.182
Uh, I happen to be in a good mood because

00:15.183 --> 00:17.784
my son Derrick is home from
law school for the Summer.

00:17.785 --> 00:19.859
Now, I don't play favorites
with my children...

00:19.860 --> 00:21.368
But Derrick's my favorite.

00:23.026 --> 00:24.760
So, how is he? Last time I spoke with him,

00:24.794 --> 00:26.528
him and his girlfriend Cheryl
were getting pretty serious.

00:26.563 --> 00:28.230
Well, now it's seriously over.

00:28.264 --> 00:29.464
She was all wrong for him.

00:29.499 --> 00:31.266
And I was not shy about my feelings.

00:32.902 --> 00:34.703
Aww man, poor Cheryl.

00:34.737 --> 00:37.606
I would not want to get on your
bad side because you are just...

00:38.441 --> 00:39.441
The best person ever!

00:41.311 --> 00:43.511
Well, forget about poor
Cheryl, what about poor Derrick?

00:43.535 --> 00:44.813
I mean, the boy's a mess.

00:44.847 --> 00:47.749
Ugh. This is exactly why
I'm never in relationships.

00:47.784 --> 00:49.551
And San Francisco thanks you.

00:52.355 --> 00:55.991
Well, I am going to help him get over her.

00:56.025 --> 00:59.595
I stocked the fridge, upgraded the
cable, and bought a tandem bike.

00:59.629 --> 01:01.163
Wow.

01:01.197 --> 01:03.557
You know exactly what a
broken-hearted 24-year-old guy needs.

01:05.001 --> 01:06.602
Tandem bike riding with his mother.

01:07.670 --> 01:08.910
Look, Derrick's on the rebound.

01:08.934 --> 01:10.272
What he needs is a new girl.

01:10.306 --> 01:12.040
He already has a girl:

01:12.075 --> 01:13.075
His mama.

01:14.711 --> 01:16.972
Maybe you're right. Maybe I should
hook Derrick up with someone.

01:16.996 --> 01:20.115
But where am I going to find
someone good enough for my son?

01:20.149 --> 01:23.752
I mean, come on. Someone who's smart...

01:23.786 --> 01:25.454
Sweet.

01:25.488 --> 01:26.622
I mean, totally together.

01:28.558 --> 01:30.292
- I know, Gabi?
- Yes?

01:31.961 --> 01:33.662
Is Sofia seeing anyone?

01:35.798 --> 01:39.468
Josh! There's been a
horrible disaster, I need you!

01:39.502 --> 01:41.203
What's wrong? You're shaking.

01:41.237 --> 01:44.148
A pipe burst in my townhouse
and all my clothes are wet.

01:45.208 --> 01:46.642
(Panting)

01:46.676 --> 01:49.217
Juju, can I stay here
until they fix everything?

01:49.218 --> 01:51.029
- It should only take a week.
- Of course.

01:51.064 --> 01:53.165
It'll be like a sneak
peek of when we're married.

01:53.199 --> 01:55.901
Maybe you'll get a
little sneak peek tonight?

01:55.935 --> 01:57.503
Living with you is already awesome.

01:58.471 --> 01:59.671
How great is this, right guys?

01:59.695 --> 02:00.695
- Super fun.
- Fantastic.

02:00.700 --> 02:01.700
Can't wait.

02:12.452 --> 02:14.186
Hi.

02:14.220 --> 02:17.022
Oh, you're looking nice for your date.

02:17.056 --> 02:20.073
I'm already getting cozy
with mine, SeÃ±or Kettle Corn.

02:21.094 --> 02:22.394
Oh.

02:22.428 --> 02:24.429
Oh, someone's already
getting to second base.

02:26.065 --> 02:27.065
<i>(Knocking)</i>

02:28.067 --> 02:29.434
Oh, my god, that's him.

02:29.469 --> 02:31.136
I'm so excited.

02:33.039 --> 02:35.073
There's nothing sexier than a lawyer.

02:36.276 --> 02:38.277
Ooh, except a lawyer with flowers.

02:40.246 --> 02:41.346
I do not object.

02:42.382 --> 02:43.382
Sofia?

02:43.383 --> 02:45.150
Guilty as charged.

02:45.185 --> 02:47.286
Come on in, Derrick.

02:47.320 --> 02:50.989
Hi, I'm the girl your mother didn't
think was good enough for you.

02:51.024 --> 02:52.157
Oh, Gabi?

02:52.192 --> 02:53.992
It's funny, you don't
look like a train wreck.

02:55.428 --> 02:58.063
Sofia, I was thinking maybe we could, uh...

02:59.432 --> 03:01.200
I'm sorry, I can't do this.

03:01.234 --> 03:03.368
Wow, that's the fastest
I've ever been dumped.

03:04.441 --> 03:07.688
Look, it's not you, it's just the girl
I'm in love with just broke up with me.

03:07.689 --> 03:09.619
- Sofia and Gabi: Aww
- You should sue her.

03:11.211 --> 03:12.311
Do you wanna talk about it?

03:12.345 --> 03:14.246
Not really.

03:14.280 --> 03:17.049
It's just, she couldn't see a future
with us 'cause my mom didn't like her.

03:17.083 --> 03:18.243
Why, what was wrong with her?

03:18.267 --> 03:19.284
Nothing, she was perfect.

03:19.319 --> 03:22.221
She was top of her class in law
school, and she's an academic fellow

03:22.255 --> 03:23.388
for the united nations.

03:23.423 --> 03:26.692
Wow, so she's good enough for
the entire world, but not Yolanda.

03:27.727 --> 03:29.428
But Derrick, Cheryl sounds like the one.

03:29.462 --> 03:31.302
I mean, you don't just
meet somebody like that.

03:31.326 --> 03:33.805
I mean... I had that with
my last boyfriend, Cooper.

03:33.829 --> 03:35.934
We had this amazing
connection until, you know...

03:35.969 --> 03:37.436
He dumped me and moved to China.

03:38.638 --> 03:40.638
But, you know, the point
is if you love somebody...

03:40.662 --> 03:43.976
I do! And she's perfect for me,
but my mom refuses to see that.

03:44.010 --> 03:45.530
- Well then, you gotta make her.
- How?

03:46.012 --> 03:46.912
I don't know, why don't you...

03:46.946 --> 03:51.216
Date somebody who's not perfect for
you, somebody that Yolanda hates so much

03:51.251 --> 03:53.051
that she'll be begging Cheryl to come back.

03:53.086 --> 03:54.820
Uh, fine. I'll do it.

03:57.590 --> 03:58.757
Not you, Yolanda likes you.

03:58.791 --> 04:01.393
You're sweet and smart
and totally together.

04:01.427 --> 04:04.438
I mean, why do you think she tried
to set Derrick up with you and not me?

04:07.967 --> 04:09.434
Oh, my damn.

04:09.469 --> 04:12.271
Oh, I would be the most perfect
horrible girlfriend for you.

04:12.305 --> 04:14.006
No mother ever approves of me.

04:16.676 --> 04:17.676
<i>(Doorbell rings)</i>

04:20.713 --> 04:22.180
- Hey, mom.
- Oh, hey.

04:22.215 --> 04:23.335
Hey baby, how was your date?

04:23.349 --> 04:24.349
Great, you were so right.

04:24.384 --> 04:26.218
Oh, mama's always right.

04:26.252 --> 04:28.854
She's funny, she's smart, she's amazing!

04:28.888 --> 04:30.422
Oh, good morning, Yolanda.

04:30.456 --> 04:31.456
Hey, baby pie.

04:31.491 --> 04:32.524
(Stammering)

04:34.394 --> 04:36.931
Uh, "baby pie?" Who you callin' "baby pie?"

04:38.164 --> 04:40.866
Ooh, this is going to be
delicious. Tinder can wait.

04:42.368 --> 04:45.937
Yolanda, you have an amazing son,
and we had an amazing time last night.

04:45.972 --> 04:48.674
(Stuttering) No no no no
no no. No, no, oh, no, no, no.

04:49.642 --> 04:53.233
I set you up with Sofia.
Stable, grounded, Sofia!

04:54.113 --> 04:56.048
I mean, Gabi, I love you, but...

04:56.082 --> 04:58.684
You're not exactly future wife
of the second black President

04:58.718 --> 05:00.018
of the United States material.

05:01.487 --> 05:06.358
I think that a, uh, first lady with bad
credit and a few misdemeanors is relatable.

05:06.392 --> 05:07.993
Here come the anger sweats.

05:10.730 --> 05:14.499
I'm a go in that laundry room, and
I'm gon' get on my knees and pray!

05:16.269 --> 05:18.469
That that Tequila I hid in
the cabinet is still there.

05:22.842 --> 05:25.002
She's freaking out, she
totally believes we're a couple.

05:25.037 --> 05:26.537
You think she's ready to call Cheryl?

05:26.572 --> 05:27.512
Patience, okay?

05:27.514 --> 05:29.181
This plan is going to work perfectly.

05:29.215 --> 05:30.849
Soon, you'll be back with your girl?

05:30.883 --> 05:33.881
And I'll be alone on the couch, and
all will be right with the world.

05:37.657 --> 05:39.224
I've got news!

05:39.258 --> 05:41.159
Big news. So big that...

05:41.194 --> 05:43.194
Not now Elliot, I have
enough problems with Derrick.

05:43.218 --> 05:47.466
What would it be worth to you if I
had some information about Derrick?

05:47.467 --> 05:52.204
And by "Derrick," I mean Derrick and Gabi.
And by "Derrick and Gabi," I mean...

05:52.238 --> 05:54.072
Do my laundry for a week and I'll tell you.

05:54.107 --> 05:57.188
Well that shouldn't be too hard, I used
to wash my Barbie and Ken's clothes.

05:58.277 --> 06:00.045
Spit it out!

06:00.079 --> 06:01.079
Girl...

06:01.080 --> 06:03.849
Derrick and Gabi are
playing you like a fiddle.

06:03.883 --> 06:06.518
A big, 'ol, antique fiddle.

06:07.553 --> 06:09.254
What you talking about?

06:09.288 --> 06:11.857
They're pretending to be a
couple you'll hate so much,

06:11.891 --> 06:13.792
that you'll beg Cheryl to come back.

06:13.826 --> 06:15.761
Son of a b!

06:16.829 --> 06:17.763
Anyway...

06:17.797 --> 06:21.366
Tumble dry on low, easy on the starch,
and when it comes to detergents...

06:21.401 --> 06:22.901
I like Summer Meadow.

06:24.771 --> 06:27.572
I'm a teach those two a
lesson they will never forget.

06:27.607 --> 06:29.141
You don't play a player.

06:36.513 --> 06:37.513
I don't get it.

06:37.547 --> 06:38.648
My mom freaks out about us being a couple,

06:38.682 --> 06:41.150
and then invites us to
dinner? It doesn't make sense.

06:41.184 --> 06:42.351
Well, I guess she thought that,
you know, yelling didn't work,

06:42.386 --> 06:43.919
so she's gonna try and reason with us.

06:43.954 --> 06:46.155
But guess what? Reason
and this girl do not mix.

06:47.924 --> 06:49.759
Look, I mean, doing that for a
couple of minutes was one thing,

06:49.793 --> 06:52.113
but I don't think I can lie
to my mom for an entire dinner.

06:52.137 --> 06:53.137
She's a badass.

06:53.563 --> 06:55.264
Well, I am a badder-asser.

06:56.867 --> 06:59.502
And I am gonna be the worst girlfriend
that you have ever had. So let's rehearse.

06:59.536 --> 07:00.896
Sofia, will you be Yolanda, please?

07:00.920 --> 07:03.622
(In a sassy voice) Oh, I
could be Yolanda all night long.

07:06.209 --> 07:08.811
Is that offensive? Because if I
cross the line, just let me know.

07:09.813 --> 07:10.746
You're cool.

07:10.781 --> 07:12.481
You're damn right, I am.

07:13.550 --> 07:15.217
Okay, "Yo-fia,"

07:15.252 --> 07:16.185
give us what you got.

07:16.219 --> 07:19.188
(As Yolanda) Now, Derrick,
what do you see in Gabi?

07:19.222 --> 07:21.757
She can't pay her rent.
She didn't go to college.

07:21.792 --> 07:23.526
That girl is an
emotional tilt-a-whirl.

07:24.494 --> 07:28.197
Sofia... That was an
awesome impression. Good job.

07:28.231 --> 07:29.765
Thank you, baby.

07:29.800 --> 07:32.747
Now, Derrick, I am telling you
that girl is not right for you,

07:32.769 --> 07:34.670
and what makes you think you
know better than your mama!

07:34.705 --> 07:35.638
(Stuttering) I don't.

07:35.672 --> 07:36.672
I'll break up with her.

07:38.308 --> 07:39.442
Derrick, what was that?

07:39.476 --> 07:41.516
You lost in ten seconds.
You gotta toughen up, okay?

07:41.540 --> 07:42.812
Do you want Cheryl back or not?

07:42.846 --> 07:44.547
Yeah.

07:44.581 --> 07:46.449
Okay, then get it together, man!

07:48.352 --> 07:50.119
Less wimp, more pimp.

07:50.153 --> 07:51.954
Don't you use that tone with my son.

07:54.691 --> 07:58.874
Look, she just wants me to be happy and
you should too, you're my mom, damn it!

07:58.909 --> 08:01.764
(Both gasp) Ahh, Derrick, all right.

08:01.798 --> 08:05.187
You do that tonight, and Yolanda will be
on the phone with Cheryl before desert.

08:05.211 --> 08:06.469
(As Yolanda) Yes I will.

08:06.503 --> 08:07.636
Now give me a hug.

08:07.671 --> 08:09.605
Not you, blondie.

08:11.141 --> 08:12.141
Mama needs some sugar.

08:19.249 --> 08:20.449
Hey.

08:20.484 --> 08:23.819
Baby, (stammering) What is all this?

08:23.854 --> 08:25.921
Well, it was touch and go but...

08:25.956 --> 08:27.623
We were able to save half my clothes.

08:29.292 --> 08:30.732
This... this is half of your clothes.

08:30.756 --> 08:32.490
Yolanda's definitely gonna ask for a raise.

08:33.063 --> 08:34.063
Uh...

08:34.063 --> 08:36.565
Don't you think maybe we should
get rid of some of this stuff?

08:36.600 --> 08:39.068
No! I'd feel naked without it.

08:39.102 --> 08:41.270
Hey! Oh, speaking of
naked, do you wanna do that?

08:41.304 --> 08:42.938
(Giggles)

08:44.174 --> 08:47.543
Oh, Juju, not on Calvin Klein.

08:47.577 --> 08:49.345
Um, how about that chair?

08:49.379 --> 08:50.379
No, no, no, no.

08:50.380 --> 08:52.140
- Not on Michael Kors.
- Not on Michael Kors.

08:53.283 --> 08:54.283
That trunk looks good.

08:55.152 --> 08:56.652
Not on Valentino.

08:56.686 --> 08:58.521
You know what, babe? Forget it.

08:58.555 --> 09:00.355
I can't have sex in
front of all these people.

09:00.357 --> 09:01.357
Watch it, Calvin.

09:03.059 --> 09:06.429
Before we go out to eat, I would
just like to make a toast to Josh

09:06.463 --> 09:09.365
for the use of his very romantic terrace.

09:09.399 --> 09:11.300
And to my boo, my boo's mom,

09:11.334 --> 09:12.435
and my "boo-ooze!"

09:13.870 --> 09:15.171
I love to get my drink on.

09:16.907 --> 09:18.641
You know what else I love?

09:18.675 --> 09:21.477
Derrick, for just being the
most generous person ever.

09:21.511 --> 09:24.213
Oh, I mean, come on, babe,
what was I supposed to do?

09:24.247 --> 09:25.447
You needed a thousand dollars.

09:25.471 --> 09:26.682
A thousand dollars?

09:26.716 --> 09:28.717
Oh, yeah, I just got a cash
advance on my credit card.

09:28.752 --> 09:29.912
- Like Gabi told me.
- Mm-hmm.

09:31.555 --> 09:34.123
But don't worry, I already
found a way to pay him back.

09:34.157 --> 09:35.291
Super lotto!

09:36.760 --> 09:39.528
And, I just found out my lucky numbers
from my astrologist so we're good.

09:40.564 --> 09:41.497
Okay, okay, okay.

09:41.531 --> 09:46.101
Now I need to say something. I see that you
two have taken quite liking to each other.

09:46.136 --> 09:47.937
But I can't hold my
tongue any longer, Gabi.

09:47.971 --> 09:48.971
Here it comes.

09:49.005 --> 09:52.408
Welcome to the family!

09:52.442 --> 09:54.276
I couldn't be happier.

09:55.412 --> 09:56.412
Gabi and Derrick: What?

09:56.413 --> 09:57.346
You know what?

09:57.380 --> 09:58.914
Forget this cheap wine.

09:58.949 --> 10:02.718
I'm gonna go pop some of Josh's expensive
stuff so we can have a real toast.

10:02.752 --> 10:04.553
Ooh, I'm so excited!

10:04.588 --> 10:06.388
Ebony and Ivory.

10:10.060 --> 10:11.500
She likes us together? What happened?

10:11.524 --> 10:12.828
I'll tell you what happened.

10:12.863 --> 10:14.663
I'm coming off too well, I'm too adorable.

10:16.266 --> 10:17.266
Hey.

10:17.267 --> 10:19.869
<i>Not so adorable.</i>

10:19.903 --> 10:21.670
I know a little secret.

10:21.705 --> 10:23.672
And it's good.

10:23.707 --> 10:26.509
Hey, Elliot, listen, we're kind of in
the middle of something with Yolanda here.

10:26.543 --> 10:30.112
What would it be worth to you if I
had some information about Yolanda?

10:30.146 --> 10:32.882
And by "Yolanda," I
mean Yolanda and you two.

10:32.916 --> 10:35.518
And by "Yolanda and you two," I mean...

10:37.287 --> 10:39.287
Cook me gourmet meals for
a week and I'll tell you.

10:39.489 --> 10:40.923
Just tell me.

10:40.957 --> 10:42.637
And by "just tell me," I mean just tell me!

10:43.760 --> 10:47.596
Girl, Yolanda is playing you like a fiddle.

10:47.631 --> 10:50.065
A poor, blonde, annoying fiddle.

10:51.001 --> 10:54.970
What's he talking about? She knows
that you two are faking being a couple.

10:55.005 --> 10:56.772
What? How'd she find that out?

10:56.806 --> 10:58.607
I have no idea.

11:00.110 --> 11:04.046
What's more important is that I
love bolognese and duck confit.

11:04.080 --> 11:05.080
She's coming.

11:05.081 --> 11:06.482
I must away.

11:08.451 --> 11:09.618
Don't be shy with the butter.

11:10.520 --> 11:13.856
Ahh, here comes the champagne.

11:13.890 --> 11:15.057
Aww... ooh!

11:15.091 --> 11:16.725
Champagne!

11:16.760 --> 11:18.840
Oh, that would be a perfect
name for your first child.

11:18.864 --> 11:20.729
Okay, Yolanda, you can quit the charade.

11:20.764 --> 11:22.431
Hm? Say what now?

11:22.465 --> 11:23.465
We get it, you win.

11:23.500 --> 11:25.000
You know that we're not a couple.

11:25.035 --> 11:27.036
Ha! You're damn right I know.

11:27.070 --> 11:28.137
I'm not a pair of dice.

11:28.171 --> 11:29.672
Don't try to play me.

11:29.706 --> 11:31.740
I got to give it to
you, mom, you were right.

11:31.775 --> 11:32.935
The whole thing was a ruse...

11:32.959 --> 11:34.677
Mmm, I know, baby.

11:34.711 --> 11:36.979
In the beginning.

11:37.013 --> 11:40.716
But then, I spent so much time
with Gabi, my feelings became real.

11:40.750 --> 11:42.618
It's over! Gotcha!

11:42.652 --> 11:45.767
I'm serious, Gabi. You're smart,
you're funny, you're beautiful...

11:45.791 --> 11:47.189
(Laughs nervously) What?

11:47.223 --> 11:49.191
Look, I didn't mean for this to happen.

11:49.225 --> 11:51.727
Uh, mean for what to
happen? What's happening?

11:52.796 --> 11:54.716
Well, this whole thing
started because of Cheryl.

11:54.740 --> 11:56.620
When I'm with you, I
don't even think about her.

11:57.434 --> 11:58.334
I don't know how to say this, but...

11:58.368 --> 11:59.368
Uh, then don't.

12:00.971 --> 12:03.472
You spent so much time trying
to help me find true love,

12:04.574 --> 12:06.375
- you actually did.
- (Gasps)

12:08.244 --> 12:09.979
Oh, my damn.

12:10.013 --> 12:12.748
(Stammering) Okay, my heart is
racing. Here come the anger sweats.

12:12.782 --> 12:14.750
I'm a go in Josh's office

12:14.784 --> 12:16.719
and I'm gonna get on my
knees and I'm gonna pray.

12:16.753 --> 12:18.993
That that bourbon I hid in
the shredder is still there.

12:20.624 --> 12:22.391
Dude! That was awesome!

12:22.425 --> 12:25.027
What a performance, you even
had me fooled for a second.

12:25.061 --> 12:27.696
It wasn't a performance.

12:27.731 --> 12:28.731
I meant it.

12:29.566 --> 12:30.566
Oh, my damn.

12:36.380 --> 12:37.380
(Whispering) Sofia.

12:38.482 --> 12:39.482
Sofia.

12:40.851 --> 12:42.718
- (Louder) Sofia!
- Oh, my god!

12:42.753 --> 12:44.687
Whoa, it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me!

12:45.756 --> 12:47.456
What the hell is wrong with you?

12:47.491 --> 12:48.724
Um, I, uh...

12:51.428 --> 12:54.030
Listen, I, uh, I really messed up.

12:54.064 --> 12:55.965
Oh, what a shocking turn of events.

12:58.635 --> 13:00.955
Listen, while I was trying to
be the worst girlfriend ever,

13:00.979 --> 13:03.647
charm and sexiness just
kept oozing out of me.

13:05.042 --> 13:07.843
And then Derrick fell in love with me.

13:07.878 --> 13:09.545
With me! With me!

13:09.580 --> 13:12.100
I mean, what is this power I have
over men, I'm like "man crack."

13:12.124 --> 13:13.124
What am I going to do?

13:14.084 --> 13:15.151
Okay, calm down.

13:15.185 --> 13:17.119
- I have a plan.
- Okay, all right, what is it?

13:17.154 --> 13:19.789
But it's big, and you've
never done this before.

13:19.823 --> 13:21.543
Okay, good, I like it
already. Give it to me!

13:22.793 --> 13:24.593
- When you go to work in the morning,
- Uh-huh.

13:24.627 --> 13:26.228
<i>- Gather everybody together.
- Uh-huh.</i>

13:26.262 --> 13:27.341
And you tell them...

13:27.342 --> 13:28.842
- You ready?
- Yeah.

13:28.843 --> 13:30.024
The truth!

13:30.634 --> 13:31.634
And?

13:32.469 --> 13:33.603
There's no "and."

13:33.637 --> 13:35.338
No more plans, okay?

13:35.372 --> 13:38.741
<i>You tell Derrick that he's a great
guy, but you don't like him in that way,</i>

13:38.775 --> 13:44.480
<i>and then you apologize to Yolanda
for breaking her son's heart, again.</i>

13:44.514 --> 13:47.450
And then just stop getting
involved in other people's lives.

13:47.484 --> 13:50.052
But if I don't get involved
in other people's lives

13:50.087 --> 13:52.688
I'll have to focus on my
own and that's not fun.

13:58.128 --> 13:59.929
Josh, why are you here eating alone?

13:59.963 --> 14:01.243
Why are you here drinking alone?

14:04.434 --> 14:05.468
Both: What's wrong?

14:06.570 --> 14:09.038
I think my future wife is a hoarder.

14:09.072 --> 14:12.241
Oh, baby, I'm sure she's had her share
of men, but I wouldn't call her a...

14:12.276 --> 14:13.676
Hoarder!

14:13.710 --> 14:14.644
"Der."

14:14.678 --> 14:16.512
Oh, my bad, sorry.

14:16.546 --> 14:17.647
What's going on with you?

14:17.681 --> 14:21.484
It's Gabi. She tried to play me by
pretending she was Derrick's new girlfriend

14:21.518 --> 14:23.238
and then she made him
fall in love with her.

14:24.254 --> 14:25.855
She's all wrong for him.

14:25.889 --> 14:27.169
What's the matter with that girl?

14:27.924 --> 14:29.425
Yolanda...

14:29.459 --> 14:32.261
I'm gonna say something
that I've never said before.

14:33.330 --> 14:35.064
I don't think Gabi's the problem.

14:35.999 --> 14:37.066
Excuse me?

14:37.100 --> 14:40.736
I didn't hear "Gabi was wrong" or "crazy
white girl" anywhere in that sentence.

14:40.771 --> 14:43.832
I've never heard you say one nice thing
about any of Derrick's girlfriends.

14:43.856 --> 14:46.909
What's wrong with a mother wanting
the perfect girl for her son?

14:46.943 --> 14:48.944
He found her.

14:48.979 --> 14:49.912
Cheryl.

14:49.946 --> 14:51.514
But no...

14:51.548 --> 14:53.349
(Chuckles)

14:55.285 --> 14:57.053
I think you and Caroline
have the same issue.

14:58.088 --> 14:59.155
You can't let go.

15:00.624 --> 15:01.724
Is that what you think?

15:01.758 --> 15:02.758
I'm holding on too tight?

15:03.660 --> 15:04.560
What do you think?

15:04.594 --> 15:06.996
I think if I let him go,

15:07.030 --> 15:09.150
I'm not going to be the main
woman in his life anymore.

15:09.174 --> 15:13.436
And he's gonna run off into the sunset
with some new girl on that tandem bike.

15:14.438 --> 15:15.438
Come here.

15:17.474 --> 15:19.075
He's not going anywhere.

15:19.109 --> 15:20.810
Aww...

15:20.844 --> 15:22.778
You pay all of his bills.

15:26.516 --> 15:27.616
Caroline.

15:27.651 --> 15:29.485
I think I figured out what your problem is.

15:29.519 --> 15:31.253
Oh, which one?

15:31.288 --> 15:34.423
The one that's making my bedroom
look like a Barney's warehouse sale.

15:34.447 --> 15:38.116
Oh, Juju, I wouldn't know,
I've never been to a sale.

15:39.663 --> 15:40.796
I think...

15:40.831 --> 15:42.298
You're afraid of letting go.

15:42.332 --> 15:44.200
Really?

15:44.234 --> 15:46.202
No.

15:46.236 --> 15:49.204
You always told me that when you were a
kid, your parents travelled all the time.

15:49.228 --> 15:50.906
Even your nannies changed all the time.

15:50.941 --> 15:53.409
I was thinking...

15:53.443 --> 15:55.444
The only constant you had was your stuff.

15:57.047 --> 15:58.781
Well, I never thought of it like that.

15:59.750 --> 16:00.750
You might be right.

16:01.785 --> 16:05.254
These designers are like the
only family I've ever had.

16:05.288 --> 16:06.489
Not anymore.

16:08.024 --> 16:09.024
Aww, Juju.

16:10.060 --> 16:11.227
Hey, look at that.

16:11.261 --> 16:13.129
You let go, now there's room for me.

16:13.163 --> 16:15.531
You know which outfit I
want to let go of first?

16:15.565 --> 16:16.499
Huh?

16:16.533 --> 16:17.533
This one.

16:23.173 --> 16:24.173
Gabi?

16:25.075 --> 16:27.009
Oh, Derrick.

16:28.745 --> 16:30.613
Derrick, Derrick, Derrick, we need to talk.

16:30.647 --> 16:32.087
Yeah, actually I wanted to talk to...

16:32.111 --> 16:33.278
No, no, shh. Me first.

16:34.618 --> 16:36.018
Come on, let's go somewhere private.

16:37.554 --> 16:39.088
Derrick...

16:40.056 --> 16:41.924
Love is funny sometimes.

16:41.958 --> 16:44.727
It, uh, it creeps up on you
when you least expect it.

16:44.761 --> 16:46.662
You can't control it. You can't predict it.

16:46.696 --> 16:48.464
And you can't force it.

16:48.498 --> 16:49.432
What I'm trying to say is...

16:49.466 --> 16:51.367
Gabi, I'm not in love with you.

16:51.401 --> 16:53.035
I just wanted my mom to think I was.

16:53.069 --> 16:55.171
Oh, yeah, rejection is hard.

16:55.205 --> 16:57.039
No, it's not that.

16:57.073 --> 16:59.742
It's just when your plan failed
I had to think of something else.

16:59.776 --> 17:02.411
- I was desperate.
- Okay, okay.

17:02.446 --> 17:05.513
Let's say that I believe that
you came up with this new plan.

17:05.549 --> 17:07.116
That was better than mine.

17:08.452 --> 17:09.692
I mean, why didn't you tell me?

17:09.715 --> 17:11.053
Plausible deniability.

17:11.087 --> 17:12.688
(Faintly) Oh, plausible deniability...

17:14.590 --> 17:19.528
You know, Derrick, uh, you talk real fancy,
and it all seems, uh, very believable.

17:21.330 --> 17:24.066
But at the end of the day, you
know, what did your big plan get you?

17:24.099 --> 17:26.001
(Doorbell rings)

17:28.104 --> 17:30.706
Cheryl, thank you so much for coming by.

17:30.740 --> 17:32.641
Thanks for calling, Yolanda.

17:32.676 --> 17:34.477
I do not know what
changed your mind about me,

17:34.511 --> 17:36.278
but I am not going to question it.

17:37.380 --> 17:39.415
Smart girl. Now get ready

17:39.449 --> 17:42.952
because he's gonna be so
surprised when he sees you!

17:42.986 --> 17:43.986
Put on a little lipstick.

17:46.823 --> 17:47.823
Cheryl!

17:47.858 --> 17:49.625
What are you doing here?

17:49.659 --> 17:52.561
Your mom called me.
I've missed you so much.

17:53.730 --> 17:55.364
Thanks mom. You're the best.

17:55.398 --> 17:58.367
I just wanted to see you smile again, baby.

17:58.401 --> 18:00.202
I paid a lot for those teeth.

18:03.039 --> 18:04.599
So, are you okay with me calling Cheryl?

18:04.623 --> 18:08.477
Are you kidding? Yeah. Are you okay that
I manipulated you into calling Cheryl?

18:09.846 --> 18:12.515
I had to. It's true love.

18:12.549 --> 18:14.383
Oh, I know.

18:14.417 --> 18:16.318
But it doesn't mean that I don't love you.

18:16.353 --> 18:18.513
I would be lucky to have
someone like you in my family.

18:18.537 --> 18:20.071
You already do.

18:20.857 --> 18:22.658
I just have, um... I have one question.

18:22.692 --> 18:25.494
At dinner, how did you know that
Derrick and I were faking it?

18:25.529 --> 18:26.729
I have a better question.

18:26.763 --> 18:29.231
How did you know that I
knew that you were faking it?

18:31.535 --> 18:33.235
Both: Elliot!

18:35.205 --> 18:36.205
Okay.

18:36.206 --> 18:37.873
We can work this out.

18:37.908 --> 18:39.875
You, don't have to do my undies.

18:39.910 --> 18:41.477
And you...

18:41.511 --> 18:43.512
Just the duck confit
and we'll call it a day.

18:44.681 --> 18:46.382
So we all good?

18:47.584 --> 18:49.285
(Shouts)

18:52.461 --> 18:54.234
Please, just do it for me one more time.

18:54.235 --> 18:56.374
- No.
- Please, Sofia, please?

18:56.375 --> 18:58.246
Fine. (Clears throat)

18:58.861 --> 19:00.428
(As Yolanda) Oh, hell no!

19:02.531 --> 19:04.365
What did you mess up this time, Gabi?

19:05.601 --> 19:07.602
You are a roller coaster
without the brakes.

19:09.638 --> 19:10.638
Sofia...

19:10.639 --> 19:13.630
Uh-uh, I'm Yolanda, queen of the place!

19:15.628 --> 19:19.671
- Umm, Yolanda's here.
- You're damn skippy, I am.

19:20.513 --> 19:22.965
Yolanda's in the hiz-ouse!

19:23.828 --> 19:25.735
- Sofia!
- What?

19:29.259 --> 19:30.665
Oh, my damn.

19:31.609 --> 19:34.894
Pretty good impression.
You got the voice...

19:34.895 --> 19:36.908
But do you have the moves?

19:38.709 --> 19:40.382
You bet I do.

19:40.383 --> 19:43.728
Get moving!
Come on!

19:43.729 --> 19:47.947
