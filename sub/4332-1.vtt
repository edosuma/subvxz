(THUNDER RUMBLING)

01:04.378 --> 01:06.903
BUG: Now I lay me
down to sleep,

01:06.980 --> 01:08.607
I pray the Lord
my soul to keep.

01:09.249 --> 01:11.479
If I should die
before I wake,

01:11.818 --> 01:14.218
I pray the Lord
my soul to take.

01:14.287 --> 01:16.380
NEWSCASTER:
Before tonight's murder,
there has been no clue

01:16.456 --> 01:18.117
as to who
this killer might be.

01:18.225 --> 01:20.853
But now the Riverton Ripper
and the knife he uses

01:20.927 --> 01:23.657
have been caught
by a high-definition
security camera.

01:23.730 --> 01:24.992
SARAH: Any day, now.
NEWSCASTER: Police say

01:25.065 --> 01:28.296
that the killer
is a Caucasian male
in his mid-to-late 30s.

01:28.368 --> 01:29.926
It's too dark to see his face

01:30.003 --> 01:33.166
but the quality
of the image has allowed
forensic technicians

01:33.240 --> 01:34.639
to zoom in and
enhance it enough

01:34.708 --> 01:36.335
to make out
the word ''Vengeance''

01:36.410 --> 01:39.106
etched on the blade
of the Ripper's weapon.

01:39.179 --> 01:40.771
No one was in the
area at the time...

01:40.847 --> 01:42.405
SARAH: That's beautiful, Abel.

01:42.716 --> 01:44.877
And Leah's going
to love that house.

01:45.051 --> 01:46.712
Shameless distraction device.

01:47.087 --> 01:48.111
Come to bed.

01:48.188 --> 01:50.019
The news is too scary
for me to watch alone.

01:50.090 --> 01:51.216
Okay, Sarah,
I'll be up soon.

01:51.291 --> 01:54.454
NEWSCASTER: We consulted
local psychiatrist
Dr. William Blake.

01:54.761 --> 01:55.955
Oh, shit!

01:56.196 --> 01:58.323
(GROANING)
NEWSCASTER:
Here's what he had to say.

01:58.398 --> 02:00.161
DR. BLAKE:
The identity of
a killer of this sort

02:00.233 --> 02:02.758
may well not even
be known to himself.

02:02.836 --> 02:04.633
He could be
anywhere and anyone

02:04.704 --> 02:07.036
leading a normal life,
so far as he knows,

02:07.274 --> 02:08.798
and never dream
for an instant that,

02:08.875 --> 02:11.673
every so often,
he turns into a monster.

02:12.279 --> 02:13.337
ABEL: What is this?

02:13.413 --> 02:14.778
NEWSCASTER:
Twenty-one-year-old
Penny Anderson,

02:15.048 --> 02:16.174

at Boston University...

02:16.249 --> 02:17.511

Somebody!

02:17.584 --> 02:19.211

...studying for a Ph.D.
in psychology.

NEWSCASTER:
The victim's funeral
will be held tomorrow at...

02:27.093 --> 02:28.754
Dear God, tell me
this is a dream.

02:33.700 --> 02:34.997
ABEL (AS JAMES):
What's with the knife, Abel?

02:35.068 --> 02:36.729
What's with the blood?
It's really crazy stuff.

02:36.870 --> 02:40.237
It's not my knife, James!
I don't know what's with it.

02:40.440 --> 02:41.805
(AS PENNY)
I think someone
has broken in.

02:41.875 --> 02:43.502
(AS BRAD)
No one has broken in.
Come on, Penny.

02:43.577 --> 02:45.135
FEMALE VOICE: Please, Abel.
Blake said it could happen.

02:45.212 --> 02:47.407
A one in a million
chance, he said.

02:47.481 --> 02:48.880
(AS PENNY)
What if it did?

02:48.949 --> 02:51.144
He said to call him, 24/7.

02:51.218 --> 02:53.379
(AS BRAD) Abel, listen.
Call him now. You've
got to call Dr. Blake.

02:53.453 --> 02:56.081
(AS PENNY)
Please put down the knife.
Call the doctor.

02:56.156 --> 02:57.180
FEMALE VOICE:
God will help you.

02:59.392 --> 03:01.883
(AS RIPPER)
Call Dr. Blake,
and I kill your family.

03:01.995 --> 03:03.792
(GASPING)

03:03.864 --> 03:06.662
Sorry, sorry,
I just need a hug.

03:06.900 --> 03:09.391
That knife is so scary,
you know?

03:09.903 --> 03:10.927
What knife?

03:11.004 --> 03:13.598
SARAH: The Ripper's.
They've got it on tape.

03:14.274 --> 03:16.606
RIPPER:
Don't do something
stupid, Abel.

03:16.743 --> 03:17.732
Here's the deal.

03:17.811 --> 03:21.269
Just look the other way
when I kill and
your family stays alive.

03:22.682 --> 03:26.379
Turn me in,
and you'll live alone
in a house of blood.

03:27.087 --> 03:28.145

03:28.221 --> 03:29.779
(PHONE RINGING)

03:32.492 --> 03:33.618
Hello?

03:33.693 --> 03:35.558
Abel, this is Dr. Blake.
ls everything okay?

03:35.629 --> 03:38.120
No, no, no.
Everything is not okay.
I found something.

03:38.965 --> 03:40.330
What did you find?

03:40.500 --> 03:41.626
A knife.

03:41.701 --> 03:45.137
Under my bench.
And not just any knife.

03:45.205 --> 03:47.105
The one on TV.
The Ripper's knife.

03:47.173 --> 03:49.334
I swear before God,
Dr. Blake, I didn't know.

03:49.409 --> 03:51.172
But the second
that I went to call you
there was somebody,

03:51.278 --> 03:53.872
and he said
don't call you, or else...

03:53.947 --> 03:55.915
DR. BLAKE: Or else?

03:55.982 --> 03:57.279
What?

03:57.350 --> 04:00.911
Or else he would
kill Sarah. And Leah.

04:00.987 --> 04:02.113
And the others, too.

04:02.188 --> 04:05.419
Abel, I'll be there
in 10 minutes.
I want you to tell Sarah

04:05.692 --> 04:08.320
to take Leah,
and drive to her sister's.

04:08.395 --> 04:10.659
I haven't told her
about this part of my life.

04:10.730 --> 04:12.220
But you swore
to me you would.

04:12.299 --> 04:13.288
That's part
of the agreement.

04:13.366 --> 04:14.924
Just get here
before it's too late!

04:15.001 --> 04:19.130
DR. BLAKE: Abel, have Sarah
drive to May's house,
with Leah.

04:19.238 --> 04:21.536
May is working nights
and Sarah is sound asleep.

04:21.608 --> 04:22.905
I can't just wake her up.

04:22.976 --> 04:24.500
DR. BLAKE: You have to!

04:24.578 --> 04:26.443
Abel?

04:26.513 --> 04:28.208
You there?

04:28.281 --> 04:29.873

ABEL: No! No!

04:47.267 --> 04:49.394

are you looking at?
Break the door down.

04:49.469 --> 04:50.766
ABEL: I won't let
you do this! I won't!

04:50.837 --> 04:52.031
DR. BLAKE:
Open the door. Abel!

04:52.105 --> 04:53.197

Get away from me.

05:43.390 --> 05:45.051
So is Elvis.
You never know.

05:45.392 --> 05:46.416
You have an epi?

06:12.852 --> 06:13.944
He's not a monster.

06:14.988 --> 06:16.182
What do you
call him, then?

06:16.289 --> 06:18.018
I call him mentally ill.

to be human?

he's blind, too.

them all next time.

07:48.148 --> 07:49.809
What do you think
he meant?

07:50.049 --> 07:52.142
Maybe he was talking
about his other
personalities.

07:53.019 --> 07:54.748
My family is from Haiti.

07:54.821 --> 07:56.083
And down there they don't say

07:56.156 --> 07:58.624
that someone like him
has multiple personalities.

07:58.691 --> 08:00.124
What do they say he has?

08:00.693 --> 08:02.217
Multiple souls.

Abel Plenkov,

11:15.421 --> 11:17.548

turned the Ripper in.

that he can take his revenge.

come out of the river

20:27.139 --> 20:28.868
It's getting late.

20:32.011 --> 20:34.741
Thank you.

Crows, 10.
Snot-nosed kids, zip.

20:41.387 --> 20:42.718
Hey!

20:42.888 --> 20:44.116
Ass-wipe!

20:44.189 --> 20:47.352
Get your little butt to school
before I put my boot up it!

20:49.528 --> 20:51.860
Let's go! Now!

21:02.107 --> 21:04.200
Can you step back
a little bit, Quint?

21:04.276 --> 21:06.972
What's the matter?
Don't you trust me?

21:08.747 --> 21:10.078
Of course I trust you.

21:16.722 --> 21:19.816
Don't trust anyone,
you dumb shit.

21:19.892 --> 21:20.881
(LAUGHS)

21:22.161 --> 21:24.095
Thanks, Quint.
Felt good.

21:24.163 --> 21:25.221
Anytime!

21:30.402 --> 21:31.960
(PHONE RINGING)

21:35.007 --> 21:36.338
I know you want me,
Brittany.

21:37.943 --> 21:39.672
Speaking.
I've got today's
assignment, Brandon.

21:39.745 --> 21:40.734
Got paper and pen?

21:40.813 --> 21:42.508
Of course I do.

21:42.581 --> 21:44.014
Bug Hellerman, three.

21:44.083 --> 21:45.311
Bug?

21:45.484 --> 21:47.509
Alex Dunkelman, eight.
I need it done this morning.

21:47.586 --> 21:48.644
Alex gets an eight?

21:48.821 --> 21:50.618
You have a problem
with that?

21:50.689 --> 21:53.522
No, it's just that
it's pretty high on Fang's
punitive scale.

21:53.592 --> 21:56.652
Usually, giving an eight
to the son of a felon

21:57.463 --> 21:59.363
comes with a bonus, is all.

21:59.431 --> 22:00.955
Don't say something
stupid, Brandon.

22:01.033 --> 22:02.057
Nothing big.

22:02.835 --> 22:04.234
A blowjob would do.

22:04.770 --> 22:08.672
How about I have
my dog bite it off and
bury it in my backyard?

22:09.475 --> 22:11.500
How big is your backyard?

WOMAN ON RADIO:
Good morning, Riverton.

22:14.013 --> 22:17.073
It's hour 7
of Ripper Day 16.

22:17.149 --> 22:18.912
And we're talking
with Betty O'Neil,

22:18.984 --> 22:22.044
mother of Riverton
star quarterback,
Brandon O'Neil

22:22.121 --> 22:25.488
and head of the group,
Citizens for a Saner Riverton.

22:25.858 --> 22:28.588
Mrs. O'Neil,
why ban Ripper Day?

22:28.661 --> 22:30.925
It's just kids
having fun, isn't it?

22:30.996 --> 22:32.759
BETTY: No, it's not
kids having fun.

22:32.831 --> 22:34.059
It's kids having nightmares,

22:34.133 --> 22:36.601
seeing the Ripper
everywhere. Kids...

Jumpy this morning, aren't we?
Where is the sock puppet?

22:41.573 --> 22:42.665
Where did you come from?

22:42.741 --> 22:43.765
Your window, where else?

22:43.842 --> 22:45.639
WOMAN ON RADIO:
ls Brandon damaged,
do you think?

22:45.711 --> 22:47.406
BETTY:
Of course Brandon isn't...

22:47.479 --> 22:48.537
What the fuck is that?

22:48.614 --> 22:49.706
Sock puppet.

22:49.782 --> 22:51.443
On steroids?

22:51.517 --> 22:53.348
Kind of.
Kind of?

22:53.419 --> 22:55.148
Only you wear it this time.

22:55.220 --> 22:57.279
What? Excuse me?

22:57.356 --> 22:59.688
BUG: Like Jay said,
''Shock and awe.''

23:02.861 --> 23:05.159
Thought Edgar
was a home crow.

23:05.364 --> 23:06.456
Raven.

23:06.532 --> 23:08.727
He's a guard.
He watches over you,
you know?

23:08.801 --> 23:11.167
You're still spooked
by last night, right?

23:11.236 --> 23:12.965
We were all watching
the river and he came
from the woods.

23:13.038 --> 23:14.096
That's scary.

23:14.173 --> 23:17.370
Now, that's Jay's whole thing.
Never do what they expect.

23:18.343 --> 23:21.210
And now we got Edgar up there
to keep him away. So...

23:21.280 --> 23:24.215
You can have him
if you want, after tonight.

23:24.717 --> 23:26.378
Edgar.
Seriously?

23:26.452 --> 23:28.317
Yeah. It's your birthday.

23:28.387 --> 23:30.446
Well, thanks.

23:30.522 --> 23:31.955
I should get
you a present.

23:32.024 --> 23:35.653
How about a weekend
in Las Vegas with
Brittany Cunningham?

23:36.228 --> 23:37.388
Brittany doesn't
know I'm alive.

23:37.463 --> 23:39.055
She's gonna,
after two days
and two nights

23:39.131 --> 23:41.691

and high-stakes gambling.

23:41.767 --> 23:43.166
Oh, yeah.

23:43.235 --> 23:45.760
Or I could just
help you with that.

23:46.171 --> 23:48.401
Yeah, that's just as good.

23:48.474 --> 23:49.532
It's heavy.

23:49.608 --> 23:51.041
It's all the fluids.

The Lord is my shepherd.
I shall not want.

beside the still waters.

23:57.015 --> 23:59.040
He restoreth my soul.

23:59.118 --> 24:02.246
Yea, though I walk
through the valley
of the shadow of death,

24:02.321 --> 24:04.846
I will fear no evil,
for thou art with me.

24:05.057 --> 24:08.424
Thou anointest
my head with oil.

Do I close it?

later, Jerome.

not going to do,

out with them.

is ''why not.''

on Ripper Day.

You should totally
come some year, Fang.
It was wild!

25:24.670 --> 25:26.604
Like, Brandon set Bug up
to fight the monster,

25:26.672 --> 25:28.731
which was huge, by the way.

25:28.807 --> 25:31.298
And Bug,
he was so scared.

25:31.376 --> 25:34.470
Brandon didn't set
Bug up. I did.

25:35.480 --> 25:36.777
Do you know how to
steam open an envelope

25:36.849 --> 25:38.077

for an hour.

reseals perfectly.

felt last night, though.

Do not bring the wrath
of Jehovah down upon you.

a stench in the nostrils
of an angry God.

prayer group. Duh!

27:29.227 --> 27:30.489
What men will do
to you in prison

27:30.562 --> 27:33.292
is nothing compared
to what demons will
do to you in Hell.

for this, Penelope.

get you, Brandon,
and it won't be pretty.

expect it, Dunkelman.

No man does.
That's why you
got to fake it.

28:46.505 --> 28:48.097
Fake being a man
to be a man?

That's the way it works.
So, you can't run.

your fear like a man.

28:52.344 --> 28:53.368
Even though I'm not a man?

28:53.445 --> 28:54.639
Because you're not a man.

Listen,
the better you fake it,
the better man you are.

28:56.782 --> 28:58.750
Just fake it?
Well, fake it good.

act like you
don't give a shit.

say, ''Thank you very much.
That felt wonderful.''

got, Brandon?

downright cheated.

I'm amazed that
you're getting this so quick.

effortlessly for days

You don't know the half of it.
Brandon is way past mad.

33:50.342 --> 33:53.140
He's been humiliated
twice in two hours
in front of Brittany.

Me, I got caught outside
the girls' bathroom
between 2:00 and 2:30.

34:08.159 --> 34:10.059
That's when Fang
and her crew talk business.

34:10.128 --> 34:11.458
Anybody caught
in the Fang Zone

34:11.529 --> 34:13.393

is treated like a spy.

out there doesn't mean
you were spying.

something on her

that kind of
intelligence, also.

sick Dr. Blake got me

01:34:40.855 --> 01:34:42.413
and then ran away
like cowards.

01:34:42.490 --> 01:34:44.549
Jumped into the first babies
you could hide in.

01:34:44.625 --> 01:34:46.252
So I saved you for last.

01:34:46.494 --> 01:34:47.586
And I'll kill you now,

01:34:47.662 --> 01:34:49.186
or you can say
yes to a deal.

01:34:49.263 --> 01:34:50.457
What deal?

01:34:50.732 --> 01:34:53.428
Same one
I offered your father,
16 years ago today.

01:34:53.534 --> 01:34:56.765
Say yes, and you live.
Say no, and
I'll cut your throat.

01:34:57.071 --> 01:34:58.732
Say yes to what?

01:34:58.806 --> 01:35:01.138
To my happy ending
of Riverton's fairytale.

01:35:01.275 --> 01:35:02.435
There was no Ripper.

01:35:02.510 --> 01:35:03.909
Just one of the
Riverton Seven

01:35:04.045 --> 01:35:06.411
that was a little crazy,
dressed up like the Ripper,

01:35:06.514 --> 01:35:09.312
killed your mom, and Paterson,
and four of his birth-mates

01:35:09.384 --> 01:35:11.011
before we finally
stopped him.

01:35:11.085 --> 01:35:12.245
One of the Riverton Seven?

01:35:12.320 --> 01:35:14.720
The one of the seven
with the bad soul.

01:35:15.390 --> 01:35:17.187
The Ripper's soul.
BUG: Jerome?

01:35:17.892 --> 01:35:20.554
Great twist, huh?
Everybody will think
you were the killer

01:35:20.628 --> 01:35:24.064
but it turns out the attack
came from a totally
unexpected direction.

01:35:24.265 --> 01:35:25.789
You'd lay all this
on Jerome?

01:35:25.867 --> 01:35:27.960
He won't mind.
He's dead.

01:35:28.036 --> 01:35:30.027
You and me will be
Main-Street heroes

01:35:30.104 --> 01:35:32.265
helping each other
forge a new beginning.

01:35:32.340 --> 01:35:34.706
Recovering from
our tragic losses.

01:35:34.776 --> 01:35:37.643
Friends to the end.
What do you say?

01:35:37.812 --> 01:35:38.972
Deal?

01:35:40.014 --> 01:35:41.641
You're pathetic.

01:35:42.450 --> 01:35:44.315
I don't even think
you're Alex.

01:35:46.254 --> 01:35:47.653
I don't know who you are.

01:35:51.492 --> 01:35:54.928
I'm the one that's
going to kill you
if you don't say yes.

01:35:54.996 --> 01:35:56.224
And then I'll say
you did it.

01:35:56.631 --> 01:35:59.099
And I'll be the hero
all by myself.

01:35:59.167 --> 01:36:01.032
Leah saw the whole fight.
She'll vouch for me.

01:36:01.102 --> 01:36:02.399
Leah doesn't live
through the night.

01:36:02.470 --> 01:36:03.767
That's part of
the deal, too.

01:36:05.339 --> 01:36:07.068
Whoever or
whatever you are,

01:36:07.141 --> 01:36:10.269
get out of Alex.
And go back to hell,
where you came from.

01:36:10.645 --> 01:36:12.010
I mean it.

01:36:13.948 --> 01:36:15.108
Okay.

01:36:16.350 --> 01:36:17.715
But I'll take you with me.

01:36:18.286 --> 01:36:19.548
(GASPING)

01:36:23.691 --> 01:36:25.488
I thought that guy
would never leave.

01:36:27.261 --> 01:36:28.455
Alex.

01:36:31.999 --> 01:36:33.899
Where is the biggest
knife in the kitchen?

01:36:34.068 --> 01:36:35.194
Where it needs to be.

01:36:41.909 --> 01:36:42.967
Condor?

01:36:43.277 --> 01:36:44.437
Crow.

01:36:47.715 --> 01:36:49.444
(GRUNTING IN PAIN)

01:36:54.021 --> 01:36:57.013
It's all right, Bug.
Feels great.

01:36:58.493 --> 01:37:00.290
Feels fucking great.

01:37:02.730 --> 01:37:04.254
Fucking great.

01:37:04.966 --> 01:37:06.831
(SIRENS APPROACHING)

01:37:13.674 --> 01:37:14.800
Fly now.

01:37:21.415 --> 01:37:23.383
I know you're up there.

01:37:25.186 --> 01:37:27.279
And I know we're down here.

01:37:29.223 --> 01:37:30.247
COP 1 : Police!

01:37:30.324 --> 01:37:31.916
COP 2: Police!
Open the door!

01:37:32.026 --> 01:37:33.994
Open up!
Open the door!

01:37:35.129 --> 01:37:36.790
Open the door now!

01:37:37.265 --> 01:37:38.857
BUG: I am the condor.

01:37:39.967 --> 01:37:41.935
The Keeper of the Souls.

01:37:43.404 --> 01:37:46.168
I eat death for breakfast.

01:37:46.240 --> 01:37:48.902
I live in a house of blood

01:37:48.976 --> 01:37:50.637
and I accept that.

01:37:51.212 --> 01:37:52.474
COP 3: Break it down!

01:37:52.547 --> 01:37:53.946
BUG: That's all a man can do.

01:37:57.451 --> 01:37:59.510
I was ready to be
arrested that night.

01:37:59.587 --> 01:38:01.418
I wasn't ready for
what happened instead.

01:38:01.489 --> 01:38:02.547
(PEOPLE APPLAUDlNG)

01:38:02.623 --> 01:38:03.783
Leah had told
them everything,

01:38:03.858 --> 01:38:05.416
and I was celebrated
as a hero.

01:38:05.493 --> 01:38:07.085
Don't worry about it, man.
They're on your side.

01:38:07.161 --> 01:38:08.890
BUG: Alex Dunkelman
killed his stepfather,

01:38:08.963 --> 01:38:11.329
a cop, a mother
and five of the
Riverton Seven.

01:38:11.399 --> 01:38:12.423
Your sister's
right over there.

01:38:12.500 --> 01:38:15.367
BUG: And I alone
had stopped him
from killing more.

01:38:15.436 --> 01:38:17.870
I didn't feel like
a hero at all.

01:38:19.173 --> 01:38:22.108
But if it makes Riverton
feel safe at night,

01:38:22.610 --> 01:38:25.010
I'll fake that I'm their hero.

01:38:25.079 --> 01:38:26.944
And I'll fake it good.

01:38:27.682 --> 01:38:30.207
Alex wouldn't have it
any other way.
