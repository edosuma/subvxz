00:14.876 --> 00:17.948
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:17.948 --> 00:22.125
We finally gota
piece of the pie

00:23.506 --> 00:26.060
Fish don't fryin the kitchen

00:26.060 --> 00:28.925
Beans don't burnon the grill

00:28.925 --> 00:31.514
Took a whole lot of tryin'

00:31.514 --> 00:34.172
Just to get up that hill

00:34.172 --> 00:36.795
Now we're upin
the big leagues

00:36.795 --> 00:39.349
Gettin' our turn at bat

00:39.349 --> 00:41.800
As long as we
live,it's you and me, baby

00:41.800 --> 00:43.664
Ain't nothin' wrongwith that

00:43.664 --> 00:46.460
We're movin' on up

00:59.887 --> 01:04.064
We finally gota
piece of the pie

01:10.035 --> 01:13.176
Oh, Louise, this apple
pie is delicious.

01:13.176 --> 01:16.179
Florence really
outdid herself.

01:16.179 --> 01:18.492
Oh, Florence didn't
make it. I did.

01:18.492 --> 01:21.529
Oh. Well, it's
still delicious.

01:22.668 --> 01:24.187
Thank you.

01:24.187 --> 01:27.363
Except for the hard crust.

01:33.162 --> 01:35.129
You mind if I do the
carpet now, Mrs. Jefferson?

01:35.129 --> 01:37.062
Oh, no. Go right ahead.

01:37.062 --> 01:39.478
That pie sure came
out nice, didn't it?

01:39.478 --> 01:42.240
Yes, it did. You ought to try
some when you get the chance.

01:42.240 --> 01:43.379
Okay.

01:51.041 --> 01:52.871
But, Florence, what
about the carpet?

01:52.871 --> 01:54.976
Yeah, it looks pretty
scrungy, don't it?

01:56.012 --> 01:57.186
Fork, please.

01:58.532 --> 01:59.567
Oh!

01:59.567 --> 02:03.192
Oh, no, Louise!
She spilled the salt!

02:03.192 --> 02:05.366
Oh, don't worry,
Mother Jefferson.

02:05.366 --> 02:07.644
There's plenty left
for your Bloody Mary!

02:11.717 --> 02:15.480
Oh, Helen! Don't tell me
you're superstitious!

02:15.480 --> 02:18.793
Oh, only about a
couple of things.

02:18.793 --> 02:20.761
Really?

02:20.761 --> 02:23.660
Well, don't look at me
like that. Everybody's
superstitious about something.

02:23.660 --> 02:25.593
I'm not.

02:25.593 --> 02:28.217
Louise, you must be a
little superstitious.

02:28.217 --> 02:30.598
Don't black cats
make you nervous?

02:30.598 --> 02:34.326
Not unless they're six
feet tall with stockings
over their heads.

02:36.846 --> 02:38.951
I think you're putting
us on, Louise.

02:38.951 --> 02:40.988
You're not superstitious
about anything?

02:40.988 --> 02:42.196
No.

02:43.404 --> 02:47.028
Well, there's one
itsy bitsy thing.

02:47.028 --> 02:48.720
But it's hardly
worth mentioning.

02:48.720 --> 02:50.549
A-ha! C'mon, tell us.

02:50.549 --> 02:53.276
Oh, it's just an old
dried out thing
I keep in the closet.

02:53.276 --> 02:55.865
One of your dresses, dear?

02:58.419 --> 03:01.491
No! It's sort of a
good luck token.

03:01.491 --> 03:02.596
Like what?

03:02.596 --> 03:05.806
I wore it when George
and I got married.

03:05.806 --> 03:07.256
It brought me luck.

03:07.256 --> 03:10.362
I knew something was
working against me!

03:12.399 --> 03:13.986
Oh, Louise, I
wanna see it.

03:13.986 --> 03:15.643
Yeah, me too.

03:15.643 --> 03:18.025
Well, okay.

03:18.025 --> 03:21.131
George couldn't afford it,
but he bought it anyway.

03:21.131 --> 03:26.240
Back then he was just
a poor man struggling
to make a buck.

03:26.240 --> 03:28.069
And now look at him!

03:28.069 --> 03:31.763
Now he's a rich man
struggling to make a buck.

03:31.763 --> 03:35.939
Here it is. I haven't
looked at it for years.

03:37.286 --> 03:38.735
The Wonder Book
of Knowledge?

03:38.735 --> 03:41.462
You wore this on
your wedding day?

03:41.462 --> 03:44.810
Not the book! It's what
I've got pressed inside.

03:44.810 --> 03:46.191
My wedding corsage.

03:46.191 --> 03:48.918
An orchid that George
bought me.

03:48.918 --> 03:52.922
Lots of women save their
wedding corsages. What's so
superstitious about that?

03:52.922 --> 03:55.580
Well, this may
sound silly.

03:55.580 --> 03:58.099
But I've always had
this crazy idea

03:58.099 --> 04:00.516
that if anything ever
happened to that orchid

04:00.516 --> 04:04.761
if I should ever lose it,
my marriage would bust up.

04:04.761 --> 04:06.694
Sounds dumb, doesn't it?

04:06.694 --> 04:08.248
Yes.

04:11.147 --> 04:14.875
Louise, that is the most
irrational, illogical thing
I've ever heard.

04:14.875 --> 04:17.429
I know, but I can't help it!

04:17.429 --> 04:21.053
Imagine! Letting the
happiness of my marriage

04:21.053 --> 04:24.643
depend on an old,
dried-out corsage...

04:24.643 --> 04:27.128
That isn't in here!

04:27.128 --> 04:28.268
It's not in here!

04:28.268 --> 04:30.131
Oh, my God, it's missing!

04:30.131 --> 04:31.132
It isn't in here!

04:31.132 --> 04:32.651
Louise! Calm down!

04:32.651 --> 04:34.688
You calm down! Your
marriage is not in trouble.

04:34.688 --> 04:37.138
And there's nothing wrong
with yours, either.

04:38.519 --> 04:40.556
Florence, is there
any more pie?

04:40.556 --> 04:42.212
Nope.

04:42.212 --> 04:44.284
Well then,
I think I'll be going.

04:46.113 --> 04:48.115
I can't find it!

04:48.115 --> 04:49.634
Goodbye, Louise.

04:50.945 --> 04:52.913
What am I going to do?

04:52.913 --> 04:54.984
Louise, get hold of yourself.

04:54.984 --> 04:57.745
Two seconds ago you
were saying it was just
a silly superstition.

04:57.745 --> 05:00.679
But that was before I knew
the orchid was missing.

05:00.679 --> 05:02.750
What am I going to do?

05:02.750 --> 05:04.821
Don't worry, dear.

05:04.821 --> 05:10.310
Just tell George that
Mother always has a
room waiting for him.

05:15.901 --> 05:19.146
Louise, believe me,
any marriage that can stand up

05:19.146 --> 05:23.633
to 26 years of George
Jefferson can certainly
handle a lost corsage.

05:25.325 --> 05:29.294
Oh, Helen, I have this
sinking feeling right here.

05:29.294 --> 05:31.814
I just know something
awful is going to happen.

05:31.814 --> 05:35.990
It's like something
horrible is waiting for me on
the other side of that door.

05:38.234 --> 05:41.271
Oh, it ain't that
horrible. It's just Mr. Bentley.

05:41.271 --> 05:43.446
Hello, Florence, ladies...

05:44.930 --> 05:47.070
Oh, I say, is something wrong?

05:47.070 --> 05:49.797
Well, Mrs. Jefferson is
just a little upset.

05:49.797 --> 05:51.523
Oh, nothing serious, I hope?

05:51.523 --> 05:54.561
No. It's all because of
a ridiculous superstition.

05:54.561 --> 05:56.045
Oh, come now, Mrs. J.

05:56.045 --> 05:57.771
Superstition is sheer
poppycock.

05:57.771 --> 05:58.910
You hear that, Louise?

05:58.910 --> 06:00.463
Although I do
remember one time

06:00.463 --> 06:03.328
going out to a dinner
party for 13 people

06:03.328 --> 06:05.606
that turned out to
be most unlucky.

06:05.606 --> 06:06.849
Why? What happened?

06:06.849 --> 06:08.540
I got the check.

06:10.370 --> 06:12.130
I should have looked sooner.

06:12.130 --> 06:14.995
How could I lose my
lucky corsage?

06:14.995 --> 06:17.480
Oh, you don't really believe
in good luck charms, do you?

06:17.480 --> 06:19.240
You have to make
your own luck.

06:19.240 --> 06:22.865
To this day I don't
understand why one would want to
have a rabbit's foot.

06:22.865 --> 06:25.315
If one was a rabbit,
one would!

06:25.937 --> 06:27.594
True!

06:27.594 --> 06:30.459
Mrs. J., let me tell
you about my Uncle Hubert.

06:30.459 --> 06:32.702
Now, he deliberately
defied the fates

06:32.702 --> 06:34.877
by smashing an enormous
mirror in his bedroom.

06:34.877 --> 06:36.119
Oh, no!

06:36.119 --> 06:37.914
Now that's seven
years bad luck!

06:37.914 --> 06:39.502
Not for Uncle Hubert.

06:39.502 --> 06:40.710
Really?

06:40.710 --> 06:43.333
No, that very night, he
died of a heart attack.

06:44.921 --> 06:47.476
Mr. Bentley, is there
something you wanted?

06:47.476 --> 06:49.857
Ah yes. May I
borrow an umbrella?

06:49.857 --> 06:53.723
You see I've mislaid
mine and it smells
a little like rain.

06:53.723 --> 06:55.484
It's a little tricky, so I'll
just show you how to open it.

06:55.484 --> 06:59.453
Oh, no! Oh, you must never
open an umbrella indoors!

06:59.453 --> 07:01.938
The consequences
could be disastrous!

07:01.938 --> 07:06.598
Mr. Bentley! I thought you
just said that superstition
was poppycock?

07:06.598 --> 07:09.152
This isn't superstition,
it's a fact.

07:09.912 --> 07:12.604
Well, toodle-loo!

07:17.575 --> 07:19.887
Oh, Helen, I've got
this terrible feeling.

07:19.887 --> 07:21.268
George is going to leave me!

07:21.268 --> 07:22.856
Now you just stop
that, Louise.

07:22.856 --> 07:25.617
Yeah. Don't you know
it's bad luck to cry
on a dirty carpet?

07:28.344 --> 07:29.966
I think I better go
start dinner.

07:31.727 --> 07:34.108
It's another woman!
I know it is.

07:34.108 --> 07:36.766
I bet she's one of
those size seven sexpots

07:36.766 --> 07:38.872
that just come sashaying

07:38.872 --> 07:40.770
into his store everyday!

07:40.770 --> 07:43.463
You're crazy!
It's all in your head!

07:43.463 --> 07:46.604
That corsage coulda been
lost when you moved
here three years ago.

07:46.604 --> 07:51.540
You mean he's been
sneaking around with
her for three years?

07:51.540 --> 07:54.232
Now, listen to me, Louise,
and you listen good.

07:54.232 --> 07:56.268
The only thing I've ever
given George credit for

07:56.268 --> 07:58.443
is having the good
taste to love you.

07:58.443 --> 08:00.238
Now if there's
one thing I know,

08:00.238 --> 08:03.483
it's that that man is
deeply in love with you.

08:03.483 --> 08:05.519
Now, he may be a little
inconsiderate at times.

08:05.519 --> 08:08.108
But underneath he
really loves you.

08:09.627 --> 08:11.145
Hey, Weezy, don't
just stand there.

08:11.145 --> 08:13.631
Where the hell's dinner?
I'm in a big hurry!

08:15.115 --> 08:17.497
See what I mean.
He's crazy about you!

08:18.325 --> 08:20.085
I better go.
See you later.

08:21.501 --> 08:23.192
Goodbye, George.

08:23.192 --> 08:26.229
Ah! See now, that's the
way I like to hear her talk,
goin' out the door!

08:26.229 --> 08:28.059
Oh, George! You're home!

08:28.059 --> 08:30.751
Hey! Hey, hold it!
What's goin' on here?

08:30.751 --> 08:33.547
Have you been reading
Cosmopolitanagain?

08:35.411 --> 08:38.172
No, I'm just happy to see you.

08:38.172 --> 08:39.795
Did you have a nice day?

08:39.795 --> 08:42.522
Yeah, great.
Especially my lunch date.

08:42.522 --> 08:45.041
You had a date for lunch?
With who?

08:45.041 --> 08:47.181
Fred Landers, from the bank.

08:47.181 --> 08:49.701
Oh, a man.
Well, that's nice.

08:49.701 --> 08:50.978
You bet it was nice.

08:50.978 --> 08:53.256
I got a big loan
to open that new store
I've been looking at.

08:53.256 --> 08:54.534
George, where's your tie?

08:54.534 --> 08:56.225
Oh, Fred liked it,
so I gave it to him.

08:56.225 --> 08:58.986
It was horrible lookin'
anyway.

08:58.986 --> 09:02.990
George, I gave you that
tie for Christmas!

09:02.990 --> 09:06.200
Well, it came in handy, too.

09:06.200 --> 09:08.306
How would you like it
if I went to lunch

09:08.306 --> 09:09.963
and gave away your
Christmas present?

09:09.963 --> 09:11.620
Go ahead, Weezy!

09:11.620 --> 09:14.623
But you'll look kind of
funny going to lunch
wearing a television set.

09:16.141 --> 09:17.626
But, George...

09:17.626 --> 09:21.250
Now look, Weezy, it was
worth it to land that big loan.

09:21.250 --> 09:22.492
What happened to dinner?

09:22.492 --> 09:24.391
Hey, Florence,
I ain't got all night!

09:24.391 --> 09:26.600
Let's get a move on
with them can openers!

09:28.878 --> 09:30.362
What's the rush, George?

09:30.362 --> 09:32.744
I gotta see Lucinda tonight.

09:32.744 --> 09:34.366
Lucinda?

09:34.366 --> 09:36.886
Yeah. Lucinda Adams. The
woman I'm trying to buy
the store from.

09:36.886 --> 09:38.301
Oh.

09:39.544 --> 09:42.029
You call her Lucinda?

09:42.029 --> 09:44.066
Only when I talk to her.

09:46.068 --> 09:47.966
Is she pretty?

09:47.966 --> 09:49.209
Who?

09:49.209 --> 09:51.211
Lucinda!

09:51.211 --> 09:52.833
No, she ain't pretty.

09:52.833 --> 09:56.078
Oh, sure.
I bet she's got long legs,

09:56.078 --> 09:58.839
and big, blinking
eyelashes

09:58.839 --> 10:00.910
and a little puckery
mouth that goes...

10:02.187 --> 10:04.465
Huh, George, is that
what she's got?

10:04.465 --> 10:05.777
What?

10:05.777 --> 10:07.192
A little puckery
mouth that goes...

10:10.540 --> 10:12.197
What's gotten into you?

10:12.197 --> 10:15.338
All right, so she's young
and pretty but that don't
mean nothing to me.

10:15.338 --> 10:17.133
I'm used to you.

10:22.760 --> 10:25.210
Then tell me why
you've met with her

10:25.210 --> 10:27.143
four times this month?

10:27.143 --> 10:29.352
They were business meetings.

10:29.352 --> 10:32.942
I was right. Our marriage
is breaking up.

10:32.942 --> 10:35.393
What the hell is
wrong with you?

10:35.393 --> 10:37.291
Do you really have
to go out tonight?

10:37.291 --> 10:39.362
Is it a matter of
life and death?

10:39.362 --> 10:43.021
Worse. It's a matter of
dollars and cents!

10:45.817 --> 10:49.407
Look, Weezy, I got the
loan this afternoon, I'm gonna
get the store tonight,

10:49.407 --> 10:51.685
and tomorrow I'll own
the biggest cleaners
in the Village.

10:51.685 --> 10:53.376
But, George why use...

10:53.376 --> 10:54.999
Look, Weez, now
don't be hassling me.

10:54.999 --> 10:58.312
You know I need all
my strength to cut
Florence's pot roast.

11:03.973 --> 11:06.631
Will you just answer
me one question?

11:06.631 --> 11:07.632
What?

11:08.978 --> 11:10.221
Do you love me?

11:10.221 --> 11:11.222
Now, that is dumb.

11:11.222 --> 11:13.465
Of course I love you.

11:13.465 --> 11:15.019
Then how come
you never tell me?

11:15.019 --> 11:16.572
I'm telling you now.

11:17.953 --> 11:19.540
I didn't hear you.

11:19.540 --> 11:22.509
Okay, I love you!
I love you! I love you!

11:26.168 --> 11:28.377
You don't love me.

11:32.933 --> 11:35.902
You know, Weezy,
I think you've finally
flipped your lid!

11:35.902 --> 11:39.077
All right, then just tell
me how you feel about me now.

11:39.077 --> 11:40.734
Right now.
This very minute.

11:40.734 --> 11:43.944
Right now, this very
minute, I think you're
a pain in the butt!

11:50.364 --> 11:53.195
Weezy! Hey!

11:53.195 --> 11:54.644
Dinner is served,

11:56.854 --> 11:59.753
maybe for the last time.

11:59.753 --> 12:03.308
What the hell's going on
here? What's with Weezy?

12:03.308 --> 12:05.863
Oh, nothing much, she
just thinks her marriage
is on the rocks.

12:05.863 --> 12:07.519
What makes her think
something like that?

12:07.519 --> 12:10.350
Cause she lost her
wedding corsage.

12:10.350 --> 12:12.766
She can't find it, so she
thinks your marriage is over.

12:12.766 --> 12:15.113
That is ridiculous.
Oh, yeah?

12:17.046 --> 12:18.185
Where are you going?

12:18.185 --> 12:20.015
Out.
Out?

12:20.015 --> 12:22.396
I need to think, George.
I want to be alone.

12:22.396 --> 12:23.639
Look, Weezy, if you
want to be alone

12:23.639 --> 12:25.089
why don't you be alone
like you always are?

12:25.089 --> 12:26.642
Right here, with me.

12:30.404 --> 12:35.030
No, George. This pain in
the butt is butting out!

12:47.559 --> 12:51.253
Where could she be?
She's been gone for hours.

12:51.253 --> 12:53.773
Well, Look, I can't
wait no more. I gotta
get to that meeting.

12:53.773 --> 12:56.085
You leave now and you're
gonna lose your wife.

12:56.085 --> 12:59.399
Look, now don't start
that again! My marriage
is not bustin' up.

12:59.399 --> 13:02.402
It's just some dumb,
ridiculous superstition.

13:02.402 --> 13:07.096
Look, when folks think
something can happen
they can make it happen.

13:07.096 --> 13:09.064
That don't work.
How do you know?

13:09.064 --> 13:12.067
Cause I keep thinking you're
gonna shut up, and you don't!

13:17.727 --> 13:19.833
That's cause I'm right.

13:19.833 --> 13:21.939
What about Dumbo,
the flying elephant?

13:21.939 --> 13:23.699
Dumbo? He wasn't married!

13:23.699 --> 13:26.288
No, but when he thought
he could fly he flew.

13:26.288 --> 13:27.876
Now how do you explain that?

13:27.876 --> 13:30.499
He bought a plane ticket.

13:30.499 --> 13:32.604
No, he flapped his ears.

13:32.604 --> 13:34.020
Look, I'm going to
that meeting.

13:34.020 --> 13:36.643
Okay, but don't come crying
to me when you're all alone.

13:36.643 --> 13:38.610
Cause I don't clean
for bachelors.

13:40.267 --> 13:44.616
You don't clean for
married couples, neither!

13:44.616 --> 13:48.172
You think you so smart.
You think you've got answers
for everything, don't you?

13:48.172 --> 13:49.345
That's right, I do.

13:49.345 --> 13:51.520
Oh yeah, then
where's your wife?

13:53.833 --> 13:55.835
Are you sure the corsage
ain't in the book?

13:55.835 --> 13:57.837
Look for yourself,
it's over there on the desk.

13:59.390 --> 14:01.461
What does she care about
an old flower for anyway?

14:01.461 --> 14:03.946
I mean she's still got the
best thing from the wedding.

14:03.946 --> 14:07.639
What's that?
Me!

14:07.639 --> 14:10.539
Maybe it slipped out
or something. Where'd
she get this book from?

14:10.539 --> 14:12.058
From the hall closet.

14:13.922 --> 14:15.647
But Mrs. Jefferson already
looked in there.

14:17.580 --> 14:20.376
Hey! I found 'em.
I found 'em!

14:20.376 --> 14:21.930
You did?

14:21.930 --> 14:25.036
My boxing shorts from
the Navy. I ain't seen
these in years.

14:25.036 --> 14:26.486
What's that?

14:26.486 --> 14:28.522
Oh! That's my cup.

14:41.742 --> 14:44.642
Your cup? How the heck
do you drink out of that?

14:53.168 --> 14:54.617
You don't drink out of it.

14:54.617 --> 14:56.205
Then what do you do?

14:57.379 --> 14:59.899
Get the doorbell,
Florence!

15:02.694 --> 15:03.972
Oh, hi, Mr. Willis.

15:03.972 --> 15:05.559
Hello, Florence, is
Mr. Jefferson in?

15:05.559 --> 15:07.907
Yeah, he's in the
closet with his cup.

15:11.117 --> 15:14.223
I beg your pardon?
Oh, hi, George.

15:14.223 --> 15:16.053
Well look, don't just
stand there, Willis, help me.

15:16.053 --> 15:17.330
Oh, sure.

15:20.505 --> 15:22.024
Oh, man.

15:22.024 --> 15:23.853
Hey, Florence, why don't you
look in the bedroom closets?

15:23.853 --> 15:27.788
Okay, but it's just a
waste of time. If you ask
me, your marriage is over!

15:27.788 --> 15:30.274
Florence!
I'm going.

15:30.274 --> 15:31.827
What do you want, Willis?

15:31.827 --> 15:33.587
Helen told me
about Louise.

15:33.587 --> 15:36.728
We were pretty worried
about her, so I came down
to see if I could help.

15:36.728 --> 15:38.799
Oh, you can help.
You can help me look
through these books.

15:38.799 --> 15:40.077
Right.

15:41.147 --> 15:42.631
How is Louise?

15:42.631 --> 15:45.323
I don't know. She went
stomping outta here hours ago!

15:45.323 --> 15:47.498
I don't know where she went.
Oh.

15:48.430 --> 15:51.433
Um, may I ask something else?

15:51.433 --> 15:52.537
What?

15:52.537 --> 15:54.332
What am I looking for?

15:55.471 --> 15:57.439
Louise's crummy
wedding corsage.

15:57.439 --> 15:58.612
Oh!

16:00.097 --> 16:02.030
You found it?

16:02.030 --> 16:08.381
No. But when I was
a little boy this was my
very favorite story.

16:08.381 --> 16:10.176
"The Little Engine
That Could."

16:11.832 --> 16:13.282
Willis!

16:13.282 --> 16:15.043
Oh, it's here in this
book of children's stories.

16:15.043 --> 16:17.528
You see this little
railway engine was afraid

16:17.528 --> 16:19.633
that he couldn't make it
up this big, steep hill.

16:19.633 --> 16:22.464
So all the way up he
kept saying to himself

16:22.464 --> 16:25.605
"I think I can,
I think I can,
I think I can."

16:25.605 --> 16:26.882
I don't wanna hear that!

16:26.882 --> 16:28.642
But the best part comes
when the little engine gets

16:28.642 --> 16:32.232
almost to the top of the
hill, after all that climbing.

16:32.232 --> 16:33.440
You know what he did?

16:33.440 --> 16:36.236
He flapped his ears
and flew away.

16:36.719 --> 16:38.066
What?

16:38.066 --> 16:39.757
Oh no, that was...

16:39.757 --> 16:42.484
That was Dumbo.

16:42.484 --> 16:44.555
The little engine said,

16:44.555 --> 16:47.937
"I know I can,
I know I can,
I know I can!"

16:47.937 --> 16:49.939
Will you shut up?

16:49.939 --> 16:51.079
Don't you want to
hear the end?

16:51.079 --> 16:52.735
I know the end! He made it
over the hill and he said,

16:52.735 --> 16:55.324
"I thought I could,
I thought I could,
I thought I could!"

17:00.778 --> 17:04.644
Well if you knew the
story, why didn't you stop me?

17:06.749 --> 17:08.234
Well, it's not here.

17:08.234 --> 17:11.823
Look George, why don't
you just get Louise
another corsage?

17:11.823 --> 17:13.687
Well, she don't want
another one. She wants
the one she lost.

17:13.687 --> 17:18.244
I know, George, but maybe
you can make her believe it
is the one she lost!

17:18.244 --> 17:20.142
Willis, that's dishonest

17:21.592 --> 17:23.111
and wonderful.

17:23.111 --> 17:24.181
You're terrific.

17:24.181 --> 17:27.011
Oh, thank you, George.

17:27.874 --> 17:31.326
Uh oh, touchy-feely time.

17:31.326 --> 17:33.742
Florence, did you hear
that? He likes me.

17:33.742 --> 17:36.917
Well, that puts you in
a smaller minority than us,
Mr. Willis!

17:38.264 --> 17:40.024
No, it ain't gonna work.

17:40.024 --> 17:42.130
Where am I gonna find
a dried-out corsage
this time of night?

17:42.130 --> 17:46.065
Grauer's Flower Power.
It's over at 59th Street and
Lex. They're open till nine.

17:46.065 --> 17:48.032
You can make it if you hurry.

17:48.032 --> 17:50.276
Yeah, well, it's worth a try.

17:51.691 --> 17:53.451
No, it ain't!
Why not?

17:53.451 --> 17:55.384
Cause I've got a
meeting at nine.

17:55.384 --> 17:58.456
If I miss the meeting,
I'll blow the whole deal
and I'll lose my new store.

17:58.456 --> 18:02.529
What's more important to you,
your money or your marriage?

18:02.529 --> 18:05.567
Look, Willis, I ain't got no
time for no tough questions.

18:07.879 --> 18:10.572
If you know what's good
for you, Mr. Jefferson,
you'll get that flower.

18:10.572 --> 18:12.194
How am I gonna do that?

18:12.194 --> 18:13.471
First I gotta find
the florist,

18:13.471 --> 18:15.439
then I gotta pick
out the right flower

18:15.439 --> 18:16.543
then I gotta go out
and find a cab,

18:16.543 --> 18:18.338
which is harder
than finding a flower

18:18.338 --> 18:20.892
then I gotta drive all
the way across town for
my meeting.

18:20.892 --> 18:23.102
And do all that in ten
minutes. That's impossible!

18:23.102 --> 18:25.000
Wait a minute, George.
I know how you can make it.
How?

18:25.000 --> 18:27.278
All the time you're out
there, just keep saying to
yourself,

18:27.278 --> 18:30.143
"I think I can,
I think I can,
I think I can!"

19:00.725 --> 19:02.106
Florence.

19:02.106 --> 19:03.866
Shh!

19:06.559 --> 19:09.631
You scared the shortcake
outta me, Mr. Jefferson!

19:12.047 --> 19:14.049
I didn't want to wake Weezy up
What time did she get home?

19:14.049 --> 19:17.397
About an hour ago.
What took you so long?
It's almost midnight.

19:17.397 --> 19:19.572
I had to go all the way
out to Queens to get this.

19:19.572 --> 19:21.056
What happened to
Grauer's Flower Power?

19:21.056 --> 19:25.060
Closed. That's what I get
for listening to a honkey!

19:25.060 --> 19:27.580
Anyway, I finally found
this place out in Queens.

19:27.580 --> 19:30.203
Then I had to pay the guy 25
bucks just to open the store.

19:30.203 --> 19:34.103
And another 25 bucks to
rummage through his garbage
and find an old dried corsage

19:34.103 --> 19:36.140
and another 25 bucks
for a pair of pants.

19:36.140 --> 19:39.626
A pair of pants?
Yeah, these.

19:42.767 --> 19:44.666
Well, what happened
to your pants?

19:44.666 --> 19:47.634
I left 'em in the alley
with the German shepherd.

19:51.466 --> 19:52.605
What German shepherd?

19:52.605 --> 19:55.332
The German shepherd that
was eating them up!

19:57.334 --> 20:00.199
What was a German shepherd
doing in the flower shop?

20:00.199 --> 20:03.029
About 40 miles an hour
around the turns!

20:05.273 --> 20:07.482
Well, child, you
sure look funny!

20:07.482 --> 20:09.380
Look, you wanna hear this
or not?

20:09.380 --> 20:11.451
Yeah, go on with your story.

20:11.451 --> 20:13.212
Well, there wasn't nothing
in the garbage,

20:13.212 --> 20:16.353
so Kravitz, the florist,
said his wife still had her
old wedding corsage.

20:16.353 --> 20:18.976
So we woke her up
and I bought it from her!

20:18.976 --> 20:23.325
Mrs. Kravitz actually
sold you her one and
only wedding corsage?

20:23.325 --> 20:25.085
What on earth made
her do that?

20:25.085 --> 20:27.156
200 bucks.

20:29.469 --> 20:31.471
Well, the important thing
is that you got it.

20:31.471 --> 20:33.059
Yeah, but it cost
me 275 bucks,

20:33.059 --> 20:35.164
a pair of pants and
a brand new store!

20:35.164 --> 20:36.442
I missed the
business meeting.

20:36.442 --> 20:38.202
I'm proud of you,
Mr. Jefferson.

20:38.202 --> 20:41.205
Yeah. Now where's that book?

20:41.205 --> 20:42.758
Lemme see the corsage.

20:42.758 --> 20:43.897
Hey, gimme that!

20:43.897 --> 20:46.314
LOUISE: So!

20:46.314 --> 20:49.524
You finally decided
to come home, huh?

20:49.524 --> 20:53.148
Weezy, honey!
How are you feeling, my love?

20:53.148 --> 20:54.563
How's Lucinda?

20:54.563 --> 20:56.496
I don't know,
I didn't get a chance...

20:56.496 --> 21:01.260
Uh, I guess she's fine.
In fact, she is fine.
She sends you her love.

21:01.260 --> 21:04.090
Oh boy, I'm so tired from
all that business talk.

21:04.090 --> 21:06.023
I think it's time to hit
the sack. C'mon, Weezy.

21:06.023 --> 21:08.232
Good night!
Good night!

21:10.234 --> 21:11.891
Give me that.
George.

21:12.995 --> 21:14.963
What happened to your pants?

21:17.379 --> 21:18.725
My pants? Oh...

21:18.725 --> 21:20.624
Don't worry about it,
Weezy, these ain't my pants!

21:23.627 --> 21:26.388
Oh. Then where are yours?

21:26.388 --> 21:28.183
Some dog got them.

21:29.633 --> 21:31.393
You left them
with Lucinda?

21:32.843 --> 21:35.708
Weezy!

21:35.708 --> 21:38.952
Look, George, I've done a lot
of thinking about us tonight.

21:38.952 --> 21:41.230
My God!
Florence! What's wrong?

21:41.230 --> 21:43.129
Look!
Where?

21:43.129 --> 21:44.958
There! On the carpet!
Termites!

21:44.958 --> 21:47.616
Termites!
I don't see anything!

21:51.033 --> 21:52.932
It's just the pattern
in the carpet.

21:52.932 --> 21:55.037
I never looked at it
real close before.

21:55.037 --> 21:57.316
Don't it look like
termites to you?

21:58.972 --> 22:02.182
No, it doesn't look
like termites to me.

22:02.182 --> 22:04.806
And I've got more
important things to
worry about, right now!

22:04.806 --> 22:08.223
But see how them little
squiggles go running across...

22:09.293 --> 22:11.433
Florence!

22:11.433 --> 22:13.573
Now you listen to
me, George...

22:13.573 --> 22:14.540
Yes, dear?

22:14.540 --> 22:16.714
We're gonna have this
out, right now.

22:16.714 --> 22:18.129
Look, Weezy,
I know you're upset.

22:18.129 --> 22:20.097
Florence told me about
your losing your corsage.

22:20.097 --> 22:23.825
And you probably think I'm
being very stupid, right?

22:23.825 --> 22:25.309
Wrong, wrong,
wrong, Weezy.

22:25.309 --> 22:27.725
But I just can't see how
it could disappear like that.

22:27.725 --> 22:29.037
You should give it one
more look.

22:29.037 --> 22:30.314
It's gone, George.

22:30.314 --> 22:33.041
C'mon, Weezy, just one
more look. For me.

22:39.461 --> 22:42.775
Oh, my goodness! It
is here after all!

22:42.775 --> 22:44.673
See, there, what'd I tell you?

22:44.673 --> 22:47.020
That means you do love me!

22:47.020 --> 22:50.127
I don't just love you,
Weezy, I'm crazy about you!

22:54.131 --> 22:57.997
George! What about Florence?

22:57.997 --> 23:00.482
Oh...

23:00.482 --> 23:03.451
No, Weezy, I ain't
kissin' her. Let her
get her own kisser.

23:10.354 --> 23:12.218
Isn't it wonderful,
Mrs. Jefferson?

23:12.218 --> 23:14.531
Your corsage was
there all along,

23:14.531 --> 23:17.603
snug as a bug, in a book.

23:17.603 --> 23:19.363
Can it, Florence.

23:19.363 --> 23:22.987
This isn't my corsage.
How do you know?

23:22.987 --> 23:25.680
Because I kept my corsage
in The Wonder Book of
Knowledge.

23:25.680 --> 23:28.924
Not in "The Little
Engine That Could!"

23:30.961 --> 23:33.550
Now, hold on, Mrs. Jefferson,
you could've been mistaken.

23:33.550 --> 23:37.001
Maybe, but I know my
corsage never said

23:37.001 --> 23:38.624
"Good Luck, Irene" on it!

23:41.696 --> 23:43.767
Are you gonna
tell him about it?

23:43.767 --> 23:47.011
You know, Mr. Jefferson
went to a lot of trouble getting
that for you, tonight.

23:47.011 --> 23:49.497
He even missed out on
his big business deal.

23:49.497 --> 23:52.569
Don't worry.
Everything will be okay.

23:52.569 --> 23:56.469
My superstition was
pretty silly, but you know
what was even sillier?

23:56.469 --> 23:59.092
Mr. Jefferson in
them baggy pants?

24:01.750 --> 24:04.581
No, me doubting George.

24:04.581 --> 24:10.207
Anytime he gives up a
business deal to go chase
around for an old flower

24:10.207 --> 24:12.278
that's true love!

24:13.521 --> 24:16.731
Oh, and uh, Florence.

24:16.731 --> 24:19.837
We'll be getting up quite
late tomorrow morning!

24:19.837 --> 24:21.252
Knock wood!

24:46.277 --> 24:50.143
LOUISE: The Jeffersons
was videotaped in front
of a studio audience.
