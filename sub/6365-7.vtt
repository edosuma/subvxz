WEBVTT

00:00.001 --> 00:04.503
<i>Previously on</i> reign...
Why don't we get
to know one another?

00:04.505 --> 00:06.105
What do you want from me?

00:06.107 --> 00:07.639
Greer:
<i>Are you secretly</i>

00:07.641 --> 00:09.041
Protestant?
Ever since
yvette died,

00:09.043 --> 00:10.676
I've been trying
to find something

00:10.678 --> 00:13.012
To help me through it. So I
started going to services.

00:13.014 --> 00:14.380
Francis:
What do you want?

00:14.382 --> 00:17.249
What I want is what is best
for France.

00:17.251 --> 00:18.784
If the people learn
that you killed your father,

00:18.786 --> 00:21.120
They will never believe
your queen didn't know it.

00:21.122 --> 00:24.590
Your heads will be
on two pikes, side by side.

00:24.592 --> 00:25.691
Francis,
what aren't you telling me?

00:25.693 --> 00:27.559
You need to trust me.

00:27.561 --> 00:30.062
Not everything can be solved
by talking.

00:30.064 --> 00:31.530
By love.
There are things

00:31.532 --> 00:32.664
That cannot be undone.

00:37.470 --> 00:40.072
(snoring softly)

00:42.575 --> 00:46.211
Man: Halt.
(horse neighs, sputters)

00:46.213 --> 00:48.547
Here we are.

00:50.550 --> 00:52.284
May I?

00:52.286 --> 00:53.485
Just a sip.

00:53.487 --> 00:54.820
I could use some courage
right about now.

00:54.822 --> 00:56.288
No, my dear,

00:56.290 --> 00:57.689
You're highborn
and far too young.

00:57.691 --> 00:59.491
You will give it to me.

00:59.493 --> 01:01.827
Well, forgive me,
but there's little you could do

01:01.829 --> 01:03.395
To make me...

01:03.397 --> 01:04.596
(whimpers)

01:07.267 --> 01:09.101
(clears throat)

01:09.103 --> 01:10.302
I feel better already.

01:10.304 --> 01:11.804
Wake him up for me, would you?

01:11.806 --> 01:13.205
â™ª if I could wake

01:13.207 --> 01:15.107
(snoring)
â™ª my crooked heart

01:15.109 --> 01:18.510
â™ª if I was there
right from the start â™ª

01:18.512 --> 01:21.180
(chuckles)
I remember you, too.

01:21.182 --> 01:23.115
Now close
your mouth.

01:23.117 --> 01:24.116
Bow.

01:24.118 --> 01:25.484
Beg your pardon,

01:25.486 --> 01:27.786
Truly.

01:27.788 --> 01:30.322
Now go and tell catherine
her daughter's here.

01:30.324 --> 01:31.390
Tell everyone

01:31.392 --> 01:33.459
That princess claude is home.

01:34.427 --> 01:39.364
â™ª running to hide.

01:47.707 --> 01:50.442
Well, we can't seat the duke
next to lady berwell

01:50.444 --> 01:52.611
Because of...

01:54.781 --> 01:56.415
Would you like
for us to move

01:56.417 --> 01:57.749
So that you two can sit next
to each other?

02:01.788 --> 02:03.589
We seem
to be getting our work done.

02:03.591 --> 02:04.756
There's no reason
we can't do it separately.

02:04.758 --> 02:06.325
Well, normally...
Normally

02:06.327 --> 02:07.893
Francis doesn't keep secrets
from me

02:07.895 --> 02:09.895
Or make decisions
that I despise,

02:09.897 --> 02:12.197
Like bowing to corrupt nobles
or releasing murderers.

02:14.334 --> 02:15.234
Narcisse:
Your majesty.

02:15.236 --> 02:17.402
A word.

02:18.872 --> 02:20.172
Please.

02:26.479 --> 02:29.148
I know I'm rarely invited
to these working breakfasts,

02:29.150 --> 02:33.252
But the nobles have asked me
to present this to you.

02:33.254 --> 02:35.254
It's an edict.

02:35.256 --> 02:36.555
For your ratification.

02:36.557 --> 02:38.390
May I read what
you'll want me

02:38.392 --> 02:39.758
To ratify?

02:39.760 --> 02:42.227
Of course.

02:44.764 --> 02:47.266
This would require every
french subject to come forward

02:47.268 --> 02:49.268
And publicly declare their faith
to the king.

02:49.270 --> 02:49.935
What?

02:49.937 --> 02:51.436
As you see,

02:51.438 --> 02:53.672
Nobles from
saint-germain, provence,

02:53.674 --> 02:56.675
Orleans and the other regions
have all signed in support.

02:56.677 --> 02:58.677
This would force our people
to declare their faith,

02:58.679 --> 03:00.512
Under penalty of death.

03:00.514 --> 03:02.714
As long as they come forward,
they have nothing to fear.

03:02.716 --> 03:04.917
Nothing to fear
if they're catholic, you mean.

03:04.919 --> 03:07.886
This law is simply an excuse
to root out the protestants.

03:07.888 --> 03:10.289
If they lie to save themselves,
they'll be committing perjury

03:10.291 --> 03:12.391
In front of their king.
They could be executed.

03:12.393 --> 03:14.193
Then they shouldn't lie
to their king.

03:14.195 --> 03:16.461
And why are you and...

03:16.463 --> 03:19.198
The nobles pushing this now?

03:19.200 --> 03:20.732
Because France
grows more vulnerable

03:20.734 --> 03:22.534
To the protestant threat.

03:22.536 --> 03:25.537
I heard rumors that the
protestant english queen

03:25.539 --> 03:28.307
Managed to turn your
own guards against you.

03:28.309 --> 03:31.643
This is not about the english
queen or her paid traitors.

03:31.645 --> 03:34.379
This edict
will spill french blood.

03:34.381 --> 03:36.481
People will kill each other
in the streets.
True.

03:36.483 --> 03:38.517
And I assume by "people,"
you mean peasants.

03:38.519 --> 03:40.586
Because they are the first to
surrender to protestantism.

03:40.588 --> 03:43.655
By the time it reaches
the nobles, it's too late.

03:43.657 --> 03:46.525
Now's not a good time.

03:46.527 --> 03:49.394
Very well.
But you should know...

03:49.396 --> 03:50.996
Claude is back.

03:50.998 --> 03:52.798
Your little sister?

03:52.800 --> 03:55.334
We must greet her.

03:55.336 --> 03:57.569
I'll join you
shortly.

04:04.877 --> 04:07.879
I take it
that this...

04:07.881 --> 04:10.882
Isn't a request?
Oh, your majesty,

04:10.884 --> 04:13.719
It's not my choice to
overtly threaten my monarch.

04:13.721 --> 04:16.288
But yes.

04:16.290 --> 04:18.290
If this edict
is not ratified,

04:18.292 --> 04:21.026
Then the world will know
that you killed king henry.

04:24.297 --> 04:26.698
(fast tempo acoustic
intro playing)

04:29.469 --> 04:31.870
â™ª they all need something

04:31.872 --> 04:36.775
â™ª to hold on to,
they all mean well â™ª

04:36.777 --> 04:40.345
â™ª you could never
feel my story â™ª

04:40.347 --> 04:42.914
â™ª it's all you know

04:42.916 --> 04:44.049
â™ª oh!

04:44.051 --> 04:47.419
â™ª

04:53.326 --> 04:54.993
I was under the impression
that your task

04:54.995 --> 04:57.529
Was to deliver my daughter
to limoges.

04:57.531 --> 05:00.332
Or was your bishop unclear
about that?

05:00.334 --> 05:02.701
Your majesty,
the-the princess has been away

05:02.703 --> 05:04.303
From home for years.

05:04.305 --> 05:07.072
She longed to return,
and I felt for her.

05:07.074 --> 05:10.575
You do realize
the instructions came from me?

05:13.346 --> 05:15.681
Please don't be angry
with poor father benoit.

05:15.683 --> 05:18.817
I cried, I begged,
I pleaded.

05:18.819 --> 05:20.819
I missed you so.

05:20.821 --> 05:22.621
I missed my home.

05:23.690 --> 05:24.890
(chuckles)

05:26.092 --> 05:29.094
You smell of whiskey already.

05:29.096 --> 05:30.095
And my brother,

05:30.097 --> 05:31.697
Francis.

05:31.699 --> 05:33.098
Claude.

05:33.100 --> 05:34.566
You look well.

05:34.568 --> 05:36.335
The picture
of health.

05:36.337 --> 05:37.602
And you,

05:37.604 --> 05:38.837
A king.

05:38.839 --> 05:40.339
Ruler over all of us.

05:40.341 --> 05:42.040
Married and a baby.

05:42.042 --> 05:44.976
Or should I not mention those
in the same sentence?

05:44.978 --> 05:47.879
Dearest sister, may I acquaint
you with mary, my wife

05:47.881 --> 05:49.848
And your queen.

05:49.850 --> 05:51.383
Princess claude,
welcome back.

05:51.385 --> 05:52.984
You probably
don't remember me.

05:52.986 --> 05:56.588
Oh, but I do. I recall your
lovely dark hair and your smile.

05:56.590 --> 06:00.459
You seemed so tall
in those days. And sporty.

06:00.461 --> 06:02.794
You loved
to muck about outside.

06:02.796 --> 06:04.796
Do you still?
Love the outdoors? Yes.

06:04.798 --> 06:06.865
Perhaps we could go
for a walk sometime.

06:06.867 --> 06:08.633
I'd like that.

06:08.635 --> 06:10.035
Bash.

06:10.037 --> 06:11.436
Is it really you?

06:11.438 --> 06:13.438
Claude, I'd like you to meet

06:13.440 --> 06:14.906
My wife, kenna.

06:14.908 --> 06:17.008
Princess claude.
It's an honor.

06:18.478 --> 06:19.945
Is something wrong?

06:19.947 --> 06:22.080
(chuckles) I was just admiring
your beadwork.

06:22.082 --> 06:24.883
So much to
catch up on.

06:30.523 --> 06:31.923
Mary:
Greer.

06:31.925 --> 06:34.092
Excuse me.

06:36.729 --> 06:39.598
(knocking)
mary:
Greer?

06:39.600 --> 06:43.468
I'm not feeling well, mary.
I'll-I'll see you a bit later.

06:45.405 --> 06:47.806
Greer, what's wrong?

06:49.175 --> 06:50.976
It's all right.
It-it's not serious.

06:52.912 --> 06:54.846
Greer, what
happened?

06:54.848 --> 06:56.782
You're not even supposed to be
done with your wedding tour yet,

06:56.784 --> 06:58.817
And I can see that
you're hurt and upset.

06:58.819 --> 07:00.819
(sighs)

07:00.821 --> 07:04.489
We... We were traveling
through orleans,

07:04.491 --> 07:08.493
And some men attacked us.

07:08.495 --> 07:13.165
They took everything, our coin,
our wedding gifts, my dresses.

07:13.167 --> 07:15.534
We barely escaped
with our lives.

07:15.536 --> 07:17.769
But we did.
We're-we're fine now.

07:17.771 --> 07:19.771
We'll put pressure on the local
authorities to catch them.

07:19.773 --> 07:21.540
No, please don't tell anyone.

07:21.542 --> 07:24.976
Why not? Greer, what
aren't you telling me?

07:24.978 --> 07:26.945
I will find out eventually.

07:26.947 --> 07:30.182
And I won't relent
until I have answers.

07:30.184 --> 07:32.551
In orleans, there were rumors.

07:32.553 --> 07:35.220
Because lord castleroy
didn't take mass.

07:35.222 --> 07:38.590
Church representatives
came to call.

07:38.592 --> 07:42.093
We-we avoided them and moved on.

07:42.095 --> 07:45.697
They came
after us anyway.

07:45.699 --> 07:48.200
Greer, are you
telling me that...

07:48.202 --> 07:50.769
Lord castleroy
is a protestant?

07:51.971 --> 07:53.472
Did you marry a protestant?

07:53.474 --> 07:54.706
Yes.

07:54.708 --> 07:55.974
But I am still
a catholic.

07:55.976 --> 07:58.109
I haven't converted.
Yet.

07:58.111 --> 08:00.979
He is your husband.

08:00.981 --> 08:04.583
The nobles want
francis to sign a law

08:04.585 --> 08:07.586
That would force all french
subjects to declare their faith

08:07.588 --> 08:09.154
To the king publicly.

08:09.156 --> 08:11.623
They want to identify
the protestants,

08:11.625 --> 08:13.925
Put targets
on their backs.

08:13.927 --> 08:17.062
They'll be harassed
and persecuted.

08:17.064 --> 08:20.732
Mary, you must make francis see
how wrong this is.

08:20.734 --> 08:23.802
I promise I will try.

08:23.804 --> 08:25.537
I watched narcisse's estate
for three nights

08:25.539 --> 08:28.673
And no sign of montgomery.
The only visitor of note

08:28.675 --> 08:30.575
Was lola.

08:30.577 --> 08:32.777
Lola?
Why is she visiting narcisse?

08:32.779 --> 08:34.713
Why am I watching narcisse?
What does he have to do

08:34.715 --> 08:36.248
With montgomery?
I told you before

08:36.250 --> 08:38.517
That it's best
that you don't ask questions.

08:38.519 --> 08:40.785
Now, have you found the nanny,
caroline?

08:40.787 --> 08:42.787
Francis, what does
your son's former nanny

08:42.789 --> 08:44.623
Have to do with any of this?

08:44.625 --> 08:46.591
What connection does she have
to the man who killed father

08:46.593 --> 08:48.627
In a joust?
And why are you hunting a man

08:48.629 --> 08:50.629
Who father pardoned himself?

08:50.631 --> 08:52.130
It was an accident.

08:54.200 --> 08:56.034
You think there's more to it.

08:56.036 --> 08:58.103
Stop it.
You don't want to dig into this.

08:58.105 --> 09:00.639
Why not? Do you think
someone hired montgomery?

09:00.641 --> 09:03.241
Father's madness, his
obsession with England,

09:03.243 --> 09:05.010
Threatened everyone.

09:05.012 --> 09:07.579
Even you.

09:07.581 --> 09:09.848
Francis,

09:09.850 --> 09:12.651
Did you hire montgomery
to kill our father?

09:12.653 --> 09:14.719
No.

09:15.988 --> 09:18.557
(whispering):
I did it myself.

09:20.026 --> 09:21.860
I took montgomery's place.

09:26.332 --> 09:28.199
Francis.

09:31.037 --> 09:32.938
I understand.

09:32.940 --> 09:35.006
I know as well
as anyone

09:35.008 --> 09:37.275
The harm he caused.

09:37.277 --> 09:39.077
And you've been carrying
this all alone.

09:39.079 --> 09:41.880
Not alone. Narcisse knows.
He's blackmailing me.

09:41.882 --> 09:43.748
I'll kill him myself.
We can't.

09:43.750 --> 09:45.350
He has montgomery hidden away
somewhere,

09:45.352 --> 09:48.019
Ready to accuse me of regicide
if anything happens to him.

09:48.021 --> 09:50.322
Narcisse can force me
to do anything, sign anything.

09:50.324 --> 09:52.924
I have lost control
of my country.

09:52.926 --> 09:54.960
I need a way out,
or I'll be forced to sign

09:54.962 --> 09:56.328
That edict into law.

09:56.330 --> 09:58.697
People will die.

09:58.699 --> 10:00.065
And mary?

10:00.067 --> 10:02.200
She can never know.
She must

10:02.202 --> 10:05.103
Be able to deny, on oath before
god, that she knew anything.

10:06.372 --> 10:08.907
It's the only way
to keep her safe.

10:08.909 --> 10:11.176
And what of this nanny?

10:11.178 --> 10:13.311
She works for narcisse.

10:13.313 --> 10:15.680
She knew exactly what
to pry out of me.

10:15.682 --> 10:16.982
She knew about montgomery.

10:16.984 --> 10:19.317
So she might know
where he is now.

10:19.319 --> 10:22.120
I'll find this nanny.

10:22.122 --> 10:23.922
Then montgomery.

10:23.924 --> 10:26.725
Then we'll figure out
what to do with them.

10:26.727 --> 10:30.195
And then we kill narcisse.

10:33.199 --> 10:35.767
(birds chirping)

10:38.971 --> 10:40.939
All the fervor surrounding
claude's arrival,

10:40.941 --> 10:43.875
We haven't had a chance
to discuss the edict.

10:43.877 --> 10:46.845
I know it distresses you.

10:46.847 --> 10:48.413
In a way it pleases me.

10:48.415 --> 10:50.415
I know that we've
been moving

10:50.417 --> 10:52.817
In opposite directions,
but today when I saw

10:52.819 --> 10:54.285
Your reaction
to that edict,

10:54.287 --> 10:57.088
I knew we were
on the same side.

10:57.090 --> 10:59.157
Those nobles expect
you to give in.

10:59.159 --> 11:02.427
They don't know
you like I do.

11:02.429 --> 11:05.296
Take a stand, my love.

11:05.298 --> 11:06.698
I'll take it with you.

11:06.700 --> 11:08.299
Mary, I appreciate
your support, but...

11:10.670 --> 11:12.170
You're actually
considering this?

11:12.172 --> 11:15.040
I have to consider it.

11:15.042 --> 11:17.442
I'm the catholic king
of a catholic country.

11:17.444 --> 11:19.844
All my power comes from...
The nobles and
the church.

11:19.846 --> 11:22.113
They fear what happened in
scotland-- well, so do I.

11:22.115 --> 11:24.049
If you treat people

11:24.051 --> 11:26.184
As your enemy, that
is what they become.

11:26.186 --> 11:28.853
This edict is wrong.

11:28.855 --> 11:30.689
In your heart,
you know that.

11:30.691 --> 11:32.390
The man I love knows that.

11:33.926 --> 11:36.394
There are limits
to what I can do.

11:36.396 --> 11:37.996
Even as king.

11:39.331 --> 11:42.701
When the nobles are united,
I am boxed in.

11:42.703 --> 11:44.836
Well, perhaps we can find
a way to divide the nobles.

11:44.838 --> 11:45.870
No.
Together, we...

11:45.872 --> 11:47.138
I need to handle this

11:47.140 --> 11:49.340
On my own,
and I need to do it my way.

11:49.342 --> 11:51.943
What I need from you
is to be patient...

11:51.945 --> 11:54.012
And to believe in me.

11:56.716 --> 11:58.950
All right.

11:58.952 --> 12:01.920
Then I will do that.

12:01.922 --> 12:04.756
Ah...

12:04.758 --> 12:07.926
How do I go back
to my husband now, hmm?

12:07.928 --> 12:10.295
Oh...
(laughs)

12:10.297 --> 12:12.831
Discreetly.
(laughs)

12:13.766 --> 12:15.400
(knocking)

12:15.402 --> 12:16.935
(sighs)

12:16.937 --> 12:18.870
Stay there.

12:24.043 --> 12:25.110
Queen mary.

12:26.312 --> 12:29.047
To what do I owe this surprise?
Unfortunately,

12:29.049 --> 12:31.449
My husband isn't giving me
what I want.

12:31.451 --> 12:32.917
Ah.
So I've come

12:32.919 --> 12:34.385
To ask you instead.

12:38.524 --> 12:41.159
You think francis will
sign this edict into law?

12:41.161 --> 12:44.062
I believe he doesn't want to,
but when the nobles are united,

12:44.064 --> 12:46.297
They're too strong
to oppose.

12:46.299 --> 12:48.933
So why aren't you having this
conversation with your husband?

12:48.935 --> 12:50.268
I've tried.

12:50.270 --> 12:53.004
He says he needs
to handle this alone.

12:53.006 --> 12:55.406
These things he's
doing, they're wrong.

12:55.408 --> 12:58.510
Politically dangerous.
Why isn't he listening to you?

12:58.512 --> 13:00.311
Any man would...

13:00.313 --> 13:02.046
What I mean is,

13:02.048 --> 13:05.083
Mary... You are right
to want to help him,

13:05.085 --> 13:06.818
In any way you can.

13:06.820 --> 13:08.319
What can I do?

13:08.321 --> 13:10.321
We need to divide and conquer
the nobles.

13:10.323 --> 13:11.456
Narcisse reminded me

13:11.458 --> 13:13.191
That once the faith
reaches them,

13:13.193 --> 13:15.059
It's already too late
to stop it.

13:15.061 --> 13:16.561
That gave me an idea.

13:16.563 --> 13:20.198
I need a protestant noble
to oppose the edict, openly.

13:20.200 --> 13:21.466
I am a catholic.

13:21.468 --> 13:23.468
But you are a known sympathizer.

13:23.470 --> 13:25.203
There are nobles
who have already converted.

13:25.205 --> 13:26.504
I am sure of it.

13:26.506 --> 13:28.506
We just need one
to step forward publicly,

13:28.508 --> 13:30.074
And more might follow.

13:30.076 --> 13:32.343
You're asking me to
name names. Mary,

13:32.345 --> 13:34.078
People hide for
a good reason.

13:34.080 --> 13:36.247
Whoever comes forward would
be risking everything.

13:36.249 --> 13:39.050
Just get me in a room with one
so I can make my case directly.

13:39.052 --> 13:41.085
No one wants to
be the first.

13:41.087 --> 13:43.521
You can't ask people
to do things they're
not ready to do.

13:43.523 --> 13:45.490
Consider the risk
if they don't come forward.

13:45.492 --> 13:48.259
The king signs the edict,
and innocent people,

13:48.261 --> 13:52.363
People we both know and care
about, are questioned, tortured.

13:52.365 --> 13:55.200
The inquisition
will reach those nobles.

13:55.202 --> 13:57.001
Their secret faith
will look like treason.

13:57.003 --> 13:58.369
Will they be safe then?

13:58.371 --> 14:01.005
The time is now.

14:01.007 --> 14:02.574
You and I both know it.

14:02.576 --> 14:05.009
Now or never.

14:05.011 --> 14:07.011
I had it especially made
for princess claude.

14:07.013 --> 14:08.446
Do you think
she'll like it?

14:08.448 --> 14:10.014
Why are you giving
claude gifts?

14:10.016 --> 14:11.583
Well, she's a princess,
and your sister.

14:11.585 --> 14:12.584
I think we could

14:12.586 --> 14:14.118
Be friends.
Kenna,

14:14.120 --> 14:15.587
Claude is not your friend.

14:15.589 --> 14:17.522
She's not even my sister;
she's my half-sister.

14:17.524 --> 14:19.524
And while I can't speak
for her passion

14:19.526 --> 14:23.461
For beads, I know that
she's never liked other girls.
Well, people

14:23.463 --> 14:25.530
Can change--
you used to think I was just

14:25.532 --> 14:28.199
A shallow girl who only cared
for nice jewels and parties.

14:29.435 --> 14:31.135
All right, fine, I still like

14:31.137 --> 14:32.270
Nice things
and parties,

14:32.272 --> 14:33.404
But is that a crime?

14:33.406 --> 14:35.073
This castle used
to be fun.

14:35.075 --> 14:37.175
On behalf of France,
I'd like to apologize

14:37.177 --> 14:39.010
For the plague, famine
and religious violence.

14:39.012 --> 14:41.279
<i>And</i> you leave me alone
for days at a time.

14:41.281 --> 14:43.915
You don't say
where you're going.

14:43.917 --> 14:46.050
Come here, wife.
Oh, and you're
off again.

14:46.052 --> 14:47.318
Yes. Yes, I am.

14:50.289 --> 14:52.390
I love you.

14:52.392 --> 14:55.360
There's just something
that I need to look into.

14:55.362 --> 14:58.329
(sighs)

15:02.635 --> 15:05.970
Move pawns east.

15:08.240 --> 15:10.041
You wanted to
show me something?
Yeah.

15:10.043 --> 15:12.410
We found this in that...

15:12.412 --> 15:14.379
Traitor gifford's chambers.

15:14.381 --> 15:16.180
It's a cipher.

15:16.182 --> 15:18.449
Mm, the english use it
to decode messages.

15:18.451 --> 15:21.920
He was feeding
elizabeth information.

15:21.922 --> 15:23.588
If this is how
the english spies communicate,

15:23.590 --> 15:26.291
It stands to reason
there are others in France.

15:26.293 --> 15:28.059
It's a traitor's tool.

15:28.061 --> 15:30.061
And anyone who
is found with one...
No matter

15:30.063 --> 15:32.030
Their standing,
we'd know they were a spy.

15:32.032 --> 15:34.332
And anything
they said...
Would be discredited.

15:34.334 --> 15:35.934
They'd be executed.

15:35.936 --> 15:37.669
I need to borrow this.

15:37.671 --> 15:39.938
Have you made copies?
Of course.

15:39.940 --> 15:43.041
I just need to show it
to some of my advisors.

15:43.043 --> 15:45.443
Just a...
Endeavor I'm working on.

15:45.445 --> 15:47.111
(chuckles)

15:48.347 --> 15:50.515
(door opens)

15:52.551 --> 15:54.619
(child coughing)

15:59.191 --> 16:01.526
Who are you?

16:03.495 --> 16:05.496
What do you want from me?

16:10.369 --> 16:12.437
Am I somehow...

16:12.439 --> 16:15.540
To blame for your death?

16:15.542 --> 16:17.709
(coughing)

16:17.711 --> 16:20.645
You said I didn't protect you--
when did I have a chance?

16:20.647 --> 16:23.047
Why is she coughing?
What's wrong with her?

16:23.049 --> 16:25.383
(gasps)
is this how you died?

16:40.532 --> 16:42.600
Sisters share.

16:43.669 --> 16:45.069
(door opens)

16:45.071 --> 16:46.204
What is it?!

16:46.206 --> 16:47.205
It's princess claude.

16:47.207 --> 16:48.206
I've been keeping

16:48.208 --> 16:49.607
An eye on her, as you asked,

16:49.609 --> 16:52.643
And, well...

16:56.582 --> 16:59.283
â™ª

16:59.285 --> 17:01.019
(panting)

17:01.021 --> 17:02.186
Lord have mercy.

17:02.788 --> 17:04.222
Claude!

17:04.224 --> 17:05.790
Mother!
Oh, god.

17:05.792 --> 17:07.658
(scoffs):
A ride home, indeed.

17:07.660 --> 17:09.761
And you, father.

17:09.763 --> 17:12.330
I don't need this, not today.

17:13.599 --> 17:14.799
It's true I've been

17:14.801 --> 17:16.434
Spending time
with narcisse,

17:16.436 --> 17:18.569
But I'm not sure it's
any of your concern.

17:18.571 --> 17:21.272
Lola, I don't judge you,
but narcisse is dangerous.

17:21.274 --> 17:23.541
And yet you seem willing
to embrace him politically.

17:23.543 --> 17:27.178
(exhales) I just want to know,
have you grown close to him?

17:27.180 --> 17:28.780
What's between you?

17:28.782 --> 17:31.682
I'm not sure. I...

17:31.684 --> 17:33.584
He's let me know
he's interested, is all.

17:33.586 --> 17:35.053
Would he be surprised

17:35.055 --> 17:36.587
If you went back
to his estate?

17:36.589 --> 17:39.057
A moment ago you said
he was dangerous.
He is.

17:39.059 --> 17:40.591
More than you know--
which is why

17:40.593 --> 17:43.161
I must ask you, for me,
to go there tonight.

17:43.163 --> 17:45.263
Tell him that you were on
your way back to the castle

17:45.265 --> 17:47.432
And your horses needed tending,
and when you're admitted,

17:47.434 --> 17:48.800
Hide this envelope.

17:48.802 --> 17:50.401
Somewhere he won't find it.

17:50.403 --> 17:52.336
What is it?

17:52.338 --> 17:54.138
I can only say that
it's insurance,

17:54.140 --> 17:56.407
Should he make himself
an enemy to the crown.

17:56.409 --> 17:58.409
Well... Where am I
supposed to hide it?

17:58.411 --> 18:00.745
It's not as if he
leaves me alone for hours.

18:00.747 --> 18:03.081
You'll find an opportunity.
Francis,

18:03.083 --> 18:06.584
You're asking me
to deceive and betray
a powerful man for you.

18:08.720 --> 18:11.122
You're not a french subject--

18:11.124 --> 18:12.757
I cannot order
you to do this.

18:12.759 --> 18:15.126
So I am asking you to trust me.

18:16.495 --> 18:18.596
Lola, based on all
that you know of both of us,

18:18.598 --> 18:20.765
I'm asking you to choose
who you think is the better man.

18:20.767 --> 18:22.800
If you think it's me,

18:22.802 --> 18:25.236
Help me to take control of a man

18:25.238 --> 18:28.673
Who would spill any amount
of blood to get what he wanted.

18:44.223 --> 18:45.523
How could you
send him away?

18:45.525 --> 18:47.792
He'll be ruined,
defrocked.

18:47.794 --> 18:49.260
I loved him.

18:49.262 --> 18:50.795
And yet you wanted him
"frocked."

18:50.797 --> 18:52.396
You didn't love him.

18:52.398 --> 18:53.831
Oh, you seduced that
poor little priest

18:53.833 --> 18:55.900
Into bringing you home,
and once he was here,

18:55.902 --> 18:59.237
You thought you might as well
make the most of it.
And what is so wrong

18:59.239 --> 19:00.805
With wanting to come home?

19:00.807 --> 19:02.740
You are experiencing
the world, my dear.

19:02.742 --> 19:05.743
Mastering languages,
meeting influential people...

19:05.745 --> 19:08.479
You parked me with anyone
who would take me, because
you can't stand me.

19:08.481 --> 19:09.780
Oh...
What have I done

19:09.782 --> 19:10.815
To earn your ire?

19:10.817 --> 19:12.817
You're spouting nonsense!

19:12.819 --> 19:14.819
Please don't
send me away again.

19:14.821 --> 19:16.521
I've spent years
with strangers.

19:16.523 --> 19:18.189
Self-pity doesn't suit you.

19:19.324 --> 19:21.659
I missed
my brother's wedding,

19:21.661 --> 19:23.394
His coronation,

19:23.396 --> 19:25.396
My father's funeral.

19:26.365 --> 19:27.899
I've missed...

19:27.901 --> 19:30.601
Haven't you missed me at all?

19:30.603 --> 19:33.671
All right, you can stay for now.

19:33.673 --> 19:36.908
But one hint of bad behavior,
and I will send you away.

19:36.910 --> 19:38.843
Now, cheer up

19:38.845 --> 19:41.212
And get dressed
for your party.

19:45.450 --> 19:47.518
Your hair's different.

19:47.520 --> 19:49.787
Uh, there's a shop
in the village

19:49.789 --> 19:52.256
That sells
the loveliest hairpieces.

19:53.492 --> 19:54.559
(laughs softly)

19:54.561 --> 19:56.561
You're not really interested

19:56.563 --> 19:59.430
In the details of my hair,
are you?
No.

19:59.432 --> 20:00.898
Just the hair.

20:00.900 --> 20:04.602
Yes. Uh, well,
I-I was on my way back to court

20:04.604 --> 20:07.205
From the village, as I said,
and realized

20:07.207 --> 20:08.706
My horses needed tending.

20:08.708 --> 20:10.741
Thank you for that, by the way.

20:10.743 --> 20:12.877
Of course.

20:12.879 --> 20:14.645
But I shouldn't stay long.

20:14.647 --> 20:17.215
There's a welcome-home party
for princess claude.

20:17.217 --> 20:18.716
A boat party.

20:18.718 --> 20:20.718
Will you be there?

20:20.720 --> 20:22.320
No.

20:22.322 --> 20:23.921
Why sail

20:23.923 --> 20:26.324
Above the water when you
could submerge yourself

20:26.326 --> 20:27.792
And enjoy it directly?

20:27.794 --> 20:29.760
A bath?

20:29.762 --> 20:31.295
Again?

20:31.297 --> 20:33.297
Are you serious?

20:33.299 --> 20:34.632
Yes.
What is it

20:34.634 --> 20:35.933
About you and baths?

20:35.935 --> 20:37.568
Well, perhaps
I'll tell you...

20:37.570 --> 20:40.004
As you bathe.

20:41.373 --> 20:42.807
Draw it for me.

20:43.976 --> 20:45.977
I'll fetch
your servant.

20:45.979 --> 20:47.411
Uh, no.

20:47.413 --> 20:49.680
You.

20:50.916 --> 20:53.884
Look at you,
making demands already.

20:55.420 --> 20:56.754
You're learning.

21:06.732 --> 21:08.332
(door closes)

21:10.002 --> 21:12.603
(sighs)

21:17.042 --> 21:19.744
(footsteps approaching)

21:24.816 --> 21:29.353
Here. While you wait,

21:29.355 --> 21:33.291
Little something to help
you relax, 'cause you seem

21:33.293 --> 21:35.026
A little nervous.

21:40.699 --> 21:42.500
(instrumental music playing)

21:42.502 --> 21:45.369
(fireworks popping,
people cheering, applause)

21:46.705 --> 21:50.041
That's our protestant
noble, lord cane.

21:50.043 --> 21:52.643
If we can convince him
to join us.

21:55.447 --> 21:57.715
Lord cane.

21:57.717 --> 21:59.583
Francis:
It is beyond rumor now.

21:59.585 --> 22:01.385
My intelligence has confirmed

22:01.387 --> 22:03.487
That there is
another english spy among us.

22:03.489 --> 22:04.855
Among the nobles?

22:04.857 --> 22:06.390
We suspect that he is.

22:06.392 --> 22:07.925
We know that he's using
an english cipher

22:07.927 --> 22:09.593
Meant to encrypt
sensitive information.

22:09.595 --> 22:12.997
We find the cipher,
we find the spy.

22:14.333 --> 22:17.101
(knocking)

22:19.638 --> 22:21.739
(door creaking shut)

22:21.741 --> 22:26.477
You asked me what it was
about baths that I liked.

22:26.479 --> 22:29.080
I suppose it's the
vulnerability.

22:29.082 --> 22:31.882
Sense of comfort one feels,

22:31.884 --> 22:33.351
Covered,

22:33.353 --> 22:35.486
Embraced, when
in fact,

22:35.488 --> 22:37.088
One is quite exposed.

22:38.824 --> 22:40.825
Why are you here?

22:40.827 --> 22:44.095
I told you, I was on my way back
from the village.

22:45.897 --> 22:48.399
You may feel that...

22:48.401 --> 22:52.036
My bath is not the place
to discuss philosophy, but

22:52.038 --> 22:54.405
I find it ideal,
because here,

22:54.407 --> 22:56.574
Both you and I are vulnerable.

22:56.576 --> 22:59.577
And yet, you're the one
with clothes on.

22:59.579 --> 23:00.845
I can change that.

23:00.847 --> 23:03.781
No. Uh, just,
I'm fine as we are.

23:03.783 --> 23:07.418
I promise you that if we go on,

23:07.420 --> 23:09.653
You will see me
without defenses.

23:09.655 --> 23:13.591
The games I like--
they go beyond games.

23:13.593 --> 23:16.494
We will share things
that strip us both bare

23:16.496 --> 23:18.162
In every way possible.

23:18.164 --> 23:20.097
But none of this

23:20.099 --> 23:22.533
Can happen without trust.

23:22.535 --> 23:24.101
I'd like to trust you.

23:24.103 --> 23:25.636
And I you.

23:25.638 --> 23:29.073
But the risk is greater for me.

23:29.075 --> 23:31.108
The risk is always
greater for the woman.

23:31.110 --> 23:32.910
Not...

23:32.912 --> 23:35.613
If the man is seen as an enemy
of the king, your friend.

23:35.615 --> 23:37.515
Once he learns of this,

23:37.517 --> 23:39.150
Francis will try
to use you against me.

23:39.152 --> 23:40.851
That is a certainty.

23:40.853 --> 23:43.487
Why does francis think
that you're his enemy?

23:43.489 --> 23:45.589
That's a
reasonable question.

23:45.591 --> 23:47.425
And a dangerous answer.

23:47.427 --> 23:50.027
So, I will give
you two choices.

23:50.029 --> 23:52.163
One: I can leave,

23:52.165 --> 23:56.600
And you can finish
this delightful bath

23:56.602 --> 23:58.002
And go home.

23:58.004 --> 23:59.904
Your world will
remain as it is.

23:59.906 --> 24:02.807
Or you can join me
in the drawing room downstairs,

24:02.809 --> 24:05.676
And we can begin
this journey into trust.

24:05.678 --> 24:09.547
It's not a journey you will
return from unchanged,

24:09.549 --> 24:12.216
So consider it carefully.

24:22.627 --> 24:23.861
Claude:
<i>How did bash</i>
<i>and kenna get together?</i>

24:23.863 --> 24:25.996
It's a very romantic
story, actually.

24:25.998 --> 24:28.566
Father threatened to kill them
both if they didn't marry.

24:28.568 --> 24:30.734
Leave it to father.

24:30.736 --> 24:34.872
It is kind of funny,
since he'd bedded her, as well.

24:34.874 --> 24:36.574
He wasn't well, claude.

24:36.576 --> 24:37.875
He'd gone mad, I heard.

24:37.877 --> 24:39.510
Was he off his nut
when she went after him?

24:39.512 --> 24:42.012
No, but...
So, she pursued father,

24:42.014 --> 24:43.881
Settled for bash,
and now she's trying

24:43.883 --> 24:46.484
To butter me up
with gifts and invitations.

24:46.486 --> 24:48.919
Quite the social climber.

24:50.755 --> 24:52.890
She's a good person,
and she loves him.

24:52.892 --> 24:55.893
I know that you're very
protective of him, but

24:55.895 --> 24:58.629
Don't cause trouble for them,
or you'll be answering to me.

24:58.631 --> 25:02.233
And not just as your older
brother, but as your king.

25:04.636 --> 25:07.705
(laughter)

25:09.174 --> 25:12.176
Oh, very charismatic
with the nobles, that one.

25:12.178 --> 25:15.913
Gentle warning not to
be too trusting of him.

25:15.915 --> 25:18.215
CondÃ© is a prince of
the blood, after all.

25:18.217 --> 25:20.518
You hold his royal blood
against him?

25:20.520 --> 25:22.086
Well, he's a bourbon,

25:22.088 --> 25:24.989
And the bourbon family were once
rivals for the... Throne.

25:26.591 --> 25:28.592
You didn't know that, did you?

25:28.594 --> 25:30.261
No.

25:31.563 --> 25:32.930
Francis was very sickly

25:32.932 --> 25:35.099
As an infant, and there was talk
that if he died,

25:35.101 --> 25:37.301
And I failed to
produce more sons,

25:37.303 --> 25:39.937
The bourbon princes
would take the throne.

25:39.939 --> 25:41.906
Mary:
Those were different times.

25:41.908 --> 25:44.275
CondÃ© is a loyal friend
to me and to francis.

25:46.077 --> 25:49.213
Lord cane is leaving.
We need to catch him now.

25:49.215 --> 25:51.649
Lola:
<i>I don't dare believe you.</i>

25:51.651 --> 25:54.118
I only have your word
that francis killed henry.
Narcisse: Yes.

25:54.120 --> 25:55.819
I might be lying.

25:55.821 --> 25:58.155
And even if he did,
the king was mad.

25:58.157 --> 25:59.857
Those of us who heard him,

25:59.859 --> 26:02.326
Who saw the terrible things
he did, know that.

26:02.328 --> 26:04.795
I make no moral judgment
on francis's actions.

26:04.797 --> 26:07.698
But you are
blackmailing him?
Yes.

26:07.700 --> 26:10.568
Because France needs
a strong catholic leader

26:10.570 --> 26:11.969
To hold the nation together.

26:11.971 --> 26:13.704
(sighs)

26:13.706 --> 26:15.839
You've just told me
the most profound state secret.

26:15.841 --> 26:17.775
What am I supposed
to do with it?

26:17.777 --> 26:19.109
What can you do?

26:19.111 --> 26:20.844
You can't make it public.

26:20.846 --> 26:22.913
You don't want to see
francis removed from the throne.

26:22.915 --> 26:24.315
That would endanger you
and your child.

26:24.317 --> 26:26.850
And nor do I,
unless forced,

26:26.852 --> 26:29.820
'cause that would
endanger France.

26:29.822 --> 26:32.323
Well, then, why tell me?
Because when

26:32.325 --> 26:35.225
Francis comes to you and, uh,

26:35.227 --> 26:37.595
Asks you to betray my trust,

26:37.597 --> 26:40.598
I want you to remember
which of us told you the truth.

26:40.600 --> 26:45.069
About who we are,
what we are capable of.

26:45.071 --> 26:46.937
You're asking me
to be a martyr?

26:46.939 --> 26:48.372
I'm asking you to be a hero.

26:48.374 --> 26:49.873
Not the kind
with the sword.

26:49.875 --> 26:51.275
The kind who
takes a risk

26:51.277 --> 26:52.710
To save lives,
rather than waiting

26:52.712 --> 26:55.012
For someone else
to lead the way.

26:55.014 --> 26:58.682
Lord cane, the time for hiding
in the shadows has passed.

26:58.684 --> 27:00.618
What is required now is daring.

27:00.620 --> 27:02.653
Show the king that
if he stands up

27:02.655 --> 27:04.054
For the rights of protestants,

27:04.056 --> 27:06.090
That there are nobles
who will support him.

27:06.092 --> 27:08.025
Why does it matter to you?

27:08.027 --> 27:09.760
You're catholic.

27:09.762 --> 27:12.096
I am a queen
who wants to protect her people.

27:12.098 --> 27:14.031
I have a family to think of.

27:14.033 --> 27:15.766
And I have friends
who share your faith.

27:15.768 --> 27:17.635
Friends I promised
I would do

27:17.637 --> 27:19.336
Everything I could to protect.

27:19.338 --> 27:21.038
Don't we owe it

27:21.040 --> 27:23.841
To the people we love to
stand up for what we believe in?

27:25.043 --> 27:27.645
It's not the kind of decision
one can make in the moment.

27:27.647 --> 27:31.081
Let me sleep on it,
then you'll have my answer.

27:31.083 --> 27:32.383
Of course.

27:35.353 --> 27:38.656
(fireworks squealing, popping)

27:38.658 --> 27:42.126
(crowd exclaiming)

27:44.863 --> 27:47.197
You are daring

27:47.199 --> 27:48.732
And fierce.

27:48.734 --> 27:51.135
I feel I
have to be.

27:51.137 --> 27:54.838
Until others find it within
themselves to be the same.

27:54.840 --> 27:57.207
(fireworks popping,
crowd exclaiming)

27:57.209 --> 27:59.743
(sighs)

28:02.047 --> 28:03.681
(fireworks continue)

28:03.683 --> 28:06.050
(door opening)

28:09.387 --> 28:11.388
What happened?
Did you succeed?

28:11.390 --> 28:14.158
What was in the envelope?
I told you before,

28:14.160 --> 28:15.893
It's best for you
if you don't know.

28:15.895 --> 28:17.428
Francis, could whatever
you wanted me to leave there

28:17.430 --> 28:19.930
Cause his death?

28:19.932 --> 28:21.732
Yes.

28:21.734 --> 28:24.268
Why?
Because I need
something in place

28:24.270 --> 28:25.969
In case the threat of
narcisse becomes too great.

28:25.971 --> 28:28.372
Lola, did you plant it or not?

28:28.374 --> 28:29.907
I'm sorry. I wasn't able to.

28:29.909 --> 28:31.241
He became too suspicious,
and I left.

28:31.243 --> 28:33.477
Lola, I know
you were frightened,

28:33.479 --> 28:35.412
But I needed you to do this.

28:35.414 --> 28:37.047
Because you're the better man?

28:38.450 --> 28:41.985
Well, one of you used me,
and it wasn't him.

28:46.458 --> 28:49.793
(door opens, closes)

28:59.070 --> 29:00.504
He's here.

29:03.241 --> 29:05.008
King francis,

29:05.010 --> 29:08.912
We humbly come to ask you
to sign this edict.

29:12.050 --> 29:13.984
He's not going to step forward.

29:13.986 --> 29:18.255
Every noble here is united
in support of it.

29:19.891 --> 29:22.860
He's too scared.
It's over.

29:26.064 --> 29:27.798
Not every noble.

29:27.800 --> 29:29.533
(gasping)

29:29.535 --> 29:32.136
This law invites
the persecution

29:32.138 --> 29:35.038
And bloodshed of innocent people
who share different beliefs.

29:35.040 --> 29:38.008
But it won't stop the protestant
faith from reaching the nobles.

29:38.010 --> 29:39.476
'cause it already has.

29:39.478 --> 29:43.046
I am a noble,
a prince of the blood.

29:43.048 --> 29:45.048
And I am protestant.

29:45.050 --> 29:48.051
(crowd murmuring, chattering)

29:48.053 --> 29:50.154
I stand before you

29:50.156 --> 29:52.322
Today, and before
my fellow nobles,

29:52.324 --> 29:55.459
To tell you the protestants
of France are not your enemy.

29:55.461 --> 29:57.060
Just as any
catholic subject,

29:57.062 --> 30:00.197
We are loyal
to our king, our country.

30:00.199 --> 30:03.233
And we are asking you to stand
on the right side of history.

30:07.071 --> 30:11.408
I'm afraid
prince of condÃ© stands alone.

30:14.345 --> 30:17.915
I am grateful for your
honesty, cousin, but

30:17.917 --> 30:21.218
You are only one man.

30:21.220 --> 30:23.554
Man:
No.

30:24.923 --> 30:26.523
I, too, am protestant.

30:26.525 --> 30:28.225
(crowd murmuring)

30:28.227 --> 30:30.194
This is madness.

30:34.465 --> 30:36.200
King francis,

30:36.202 --> 30:38.936
In light of this development,
I ask you to take

30:38.938 --> 30:41.839
Time to reconsider this law.

30:41.841 --> 30:44.541
The bravery of these
men shall not be ignored.

30:44.543 --> 30:47.344
No one shall harm them.

30:47.346 --> 30:48.979
I shall retire
to further consider

30:48.981 --> 30:50.914
The gravity of this law.

30:56.154 --> 30:58.555
(sighs)

30:58.557 --> 31:01.124
Well, that was a bold move.

31:01.126 --> 31:03.927
There's no going back now,
no matter what your beliefs.

31:03.929 --> 31:06.263
It's what you needed,
isn't it?

31:07.398 --> 31:10.400
I did it for you.

31:11.502 --> 31:14.171
You have my gratitude.

31:22.146 --> 31:25.082
I sense your hand in this.

31:25.084 --> 31:28.886
And though you completely
disregarded my request,

31:28.888 --> 31:33.123
I am proud of you.

31:33.125 --> 31:36.159
I wanted to give you a
chance to do the right thing.

31:36.161 --> 31:38.528
And I still
believe you will.

31:42.100 --> 31:44.001
Tell me that
you have good news.

31:44.003 --> 31:45.435
Did you find the nanny?

31:45.437 --> 31:46.570
At the bottom of a stairwell.

31:46.572 --> 31:47.938
She's been dead for weeks.

31:47.940 --> 31:49.339
I'm sorry.

31:49.341 --> 31:52.276
Narcisse got to her.
He used her to get me to confess

31:52.278 --> 31:54.544
And then disposed of her
before she could tell the tale.

31:54.546 --> 31:56.947
(horse neighing)

31:58.082 --> 31:59.616
Mary and condÃ©
have bought me time,

31:59.618 --> 32:01.652
But behind closed doors...

32:01.654 --> 32:03.921
Narcisse can still
force me to sign that law.

32:03.923 --> 32:05.322
What do you want to do?

32:05.324 --> 32:06.590
The right thing.

32:06.592 --> 32:08.458
Mary has such faith in me.

32:08.460 --> 32:11.295
Every move that she made with
condÃ© was to give me a chance.

32:11.297 --> 32:13.063
I have to take it.

32:13.065 --> 32:16.199
No matter what it costs me.

32:16.201 --> 32:18.468
But it can't cost mary her life.

32:18.470 --> 32:21.204
Ready a boat and some men
to get mary out of the country.

32:21.206 --> 32:23.407
What are you talking about?
If I am accused of regicide,

32:23.409 --> 32:25.008
Mary will be implicated as well.

32:25.010 --> 32:27.311
We need to be ready
to move her immediately.

32:27.313 --> 32:28.946
Someplace safe.

32:28.948 --> 32:30.714
Far away from France.

32:30.716 --> 32:32.349
You're going to call his bluff.

32:32.351 --> 32:34.184
I can't keep running away
from what I've done.

32:34.186 --> 32:37.955
I have to face the consequences
or my country will.

32:37.957 --> 32:40.424
This could cost you your life.

32:40.426 --> 32:43.226
So be it.

32:43.228 --> 32:45.662
Just make sure
that mary is safe.

33:03.047 --> 33:05.248
Francis, is everything
all right?

33:05.250 --> 33:06.683
I was mistaken.

33:06.685 --> 33:09.119
You were right
to get involved.

33:09.121 --> 33:11.355
You and condÃ©
work well together.

33:13.057 --> 33:15.659
<i>We</i> work well together.
You and I.

33:15.661 --> 33:17.694
There was a time
when the only

33:17.696 --> 33:19.296
Way forward was one that we

33:19.298 --> 33:20.664
Made together, and I miss it.

33:22.033 --> 33:24.001
I miss my husband.

33:24.003 --> 33:26.603
I know that the edict is wrong.

33:26.605 --> 33:28.038
I won't sign it.

33:28.040 --> 33:30.607
But it might cost me.

33:30.609 --> 33:33.443
We will face the
consequences together.

33:33.445 --> 33:35.178
And we won't face
them alone.

33:35.180 --> 33:38.015
Other nobles, like condÃ©,
will stand with us.

33:38.017 --> 33:39.549
It might be difficult,

33:39.551 --> 33:41.485
But francis, you are king.

33:42.587 --> 33:44.221
What can they do to you?

33:52.196 --> 33:54.564
No matter what happens,
I love you.

33:58.236 --> 34:00.337
Claude ignored me
the whole night.

34:00.339 --> 34:04.041
She ignored my notes, my
invitations to tea, to supper.

34:04.043 --> 34:05.475
Can't help but think
it's personal, somehow.

34:05.477 --> 34:07.210
I told you she
doesn't like other girls.

34:07.212 --> 34:09.246
I saw her talking to other
girls at her party.

34:09.248 --> 34:10.447
What's her
issue with me?

34:10.449 --> 34:12.049
Well, could it be

34:12.051 --> 34:14.051
That you are the most

34:14.053 --> 34:16.086
Beautiful woman at court

34:16.088 --> 34:17.754
And that claude,
jealous and petty...

34:17.756 --> 34:20.057
And quite beautiful herself.
Very insecure,

34:20.059 --> 34:22.492
Kenna. She'll not
be your friend.

34:22.494 --> 34:24.227
She couldn't take
the competition.

34:24.229 --> 34:25.395
That's very nice,

34:25.397 --> 34:27.230
But is it true?
As you said,

34:27.232 --> 34:29.499
She's my sister.
I would know.

34:38.376 --> 34:40.377
(grunts)
(laughs)

34:40.379 --> 34:42.279
How odd.

34:42.281 --> 34:44.548
A proper hello from
everyone at court but you.

34:44.550 --> 34:46.183
We've said our hellos.
Didn't you

34:46.185 --> 34:47.551
Miss your old playmate?

34:47.553 --> 34:49.619
Didn't you love
the way we played?

34:49.621 --> 34:50.854
When shall we meet?

34:50.856 --> 34:53.156
Where?
Claude, what happened

34:53.158 --> 34:54.858
Between us
can never happen again.

34:54.860 --> 34:57.294
It wouldn't have happened at all
if you hadn't convinced me

34:57.296 --> 34:58.428
That henry wasn't
my real father.

34:58.430 --> 35:00.430
(laughing):
Convinced you?

35:00.432 --> 35:04.234
I cleared the way for you
to do what you truly wanted.

35:04.236 --> 35:07.471
How bold you are now.

35:07.473 --> 35:09.172
A man in full.

35:10.475 --> 35:12.476
Another time, then...

35:12.478 --> 35:15.245
Brother.

35:15.247 --> 35:16.513
(door opens)

35:16.515 --> 35:18.281
Narcisse:
I warned you about condÃ©.

35:18.283 --> 35:19.683
But you cannot
let him

35:19.685 --> 35:23.120
Or a few other protestant
nobles sway you.

35:23.122 --> 35:24.654
We are still the
majority, and this

35:24.656 --> 35:26.523
Will ensure that never changes.

35:26.525 --> 35:29.159
If I sign that, there will be
terror and bloodshed.

35:29.161 --> 35:30.560
Short-lived.

35:30.562 --> 35:33.497
A firm, final push
to ensure your reign.

35:33.499 --> 35:35.832
No.

35:35.834 --> 35:38.802
There are lines I will not
cross, even to save myself.

35:38.804 --> 35:40.804
Reveal my secret,

35:40.806 --> 35:43.807
Because I would rather face the
consequences and lose my head

35:43.809 --> 35:46.276
Than take orders from you.

35:46.278 --> 35:49.846
A compromised king
is not a king at all.

35:51.382 --> 35:53.850
I am impressed
with your courage.

35:53.852 --> 35:56.153
Your willingness
to sacrifice your life.

35:56.155 --> 35:58.288
But I wonder--
are you equally

35:58.290 --> 36:00.257
Prepared to sacrifice the lives

36:00.259 --> 36:01.825
Of your wife and your mother?

36:01.827 --> 36:04.461
I am familiar with this threat.

36:04.463 --> 36:06.696
And it's anyone's guess whether
they would be implicated.

36:06.698 --> 36:09.533
I can guarantee
that they will be.

36:09.535 --> 36:12.369
I'm sure you remember
that mere days

36:12.371 --> 36:14.404
Before you killed him,

36:14.406 --> 36:16.306
There was an attempt
on henry's life

36:16.308 --> 36:19.576
During a private mass.
I spoke to the attending priest

36:19.578 --> 36:23.346
And after some firm persuasion,
he told me all the details.

36:23.348 --> 36:26.316
Mary and catherine

36:26.318 --> 36:28.652
Planned henry's
murder together.

36:28.654 --> 36:31.755
They directed the
priest to poison him.

36:31.757 --> 36:36.760
So, you see this is
no longer just about you.

36:36.762 --> 36:39.329
Your mother, your
wife, will also

36:39.331 --> 36:41.698
Suffer and die.

36:41.700 --> 36:45.268
And when your
head is cut off,

36:45.270 --> 36:47.604
Along with catherine
and mary's,

36:47.606 --> 36:50.340
What do you suppose the nobles
will do to your brothers?

36:50.342 --> 36:52.709
What will happen
to your bastard son

36:52.711 --> 36:55.412
When you're not here
to protect him?

36:55.414 --> 36:58.248
They will all be
assassinated.

36:58.250 --> 37:01.284
Your child will not
reach his first birthday.

37:01.286 --> 37:04.221
It will be the end
of the valois line.

37:06.624 --> 37:09.259
(catherine sighs)

37:21.372 --> 37:22.839
Leave me.

37:43.361 --> 37:44.794
You've been tormenting me.

37:44.796 --> 37:46.396
Now you're here
with my daughter. Why?

37:46.398 --> 37:48.465
(coughs)

37:57.408 --> 37:59.542
Sisters share.

37:59.544 --> 38:01.444
Sisters?

38:04.015 --> 38:06.583
Oh, e-emone.

38:06.585 --> 38:09.719
Henriette? No.

38:09.721 --> 38:11.488
No, you died as infants.

38:11.490 --> 38:12.822
We never left you,

38:12.824 --> 38:14.557
Not really.

38:14.559 --> 38:17.027
And now...
What?

38:17.029 --> 38:18.795
Do you love her more than us?

38:20.564 --> 38:21.598
(gasps)

38:21.600 --> 38:22.766
Do you, mother?

38:23.734 --> 38:26.336
What are you doing here?

38:26.338 --> 38:29.773
I had a change of heart.
You cannot stay at court.

38:29.775 --> 38:31.708
Your home will
be elsewhere.

38:31.710 --> 38:34.577
I will make
the necessary arrangements.

38:34.579 --> 38:36.046
But, mother, why?

38:36.048 --> 38:37.981
You are my family.

38:38.983 --> 38:41.718
Just tell me why.

38:44.922 --> 38:46.589
Lady lola.

38:47.658 --> 38:50.760
Always a delight.

38:50.762 --> 38:53.730
You ask why I came to you.

38:53.732 --> 38:55.732
But I could ask
the same of you.

38:55.734 --> 38:57.334
You say you
seek something

38:57.336 --> 39:00.003
Beyond games, but your
reputation precedes you.

39:00.005 --> 39:01.738
I've read all about it.

39:01.740 --> 39:05.508
In the famed journal.
So it does exist.

39:05.510 --> 39:08.845
What detail
gripped you most?

39:08.847 --> 39:10.814
Not the point.

39:10.816 --> 39:13.416
Court is overfull
with available women.

39:13.418 --> 39:16.453
Uncomplicated women to
explore and discard.

39:16.455 --> 39:18.521
Why me?

39:18.523 --> 39:20.590
I have...

39:20.592 --> 39:22.959
No ulterior motive, lola.

39:22.961 --> 39:26.696
I suppose I do enjoy games, but

39:26.698 --> 39:29.733
I have never had
a worthy opponent.

39:31.435 --> 39:34.104
You make me do things I
would not do otherwise.

39:34.106 --> 39:37.540
But you are an adversary
to francis, an enemy.

39:37.542 --> 39:39.709
And he is not
only the father

39:39.711 --> 39:42.579
Of my child, he is my
king, and my friend.

39:42.581 --> 39:46.049
So you and I, we
cannot contin...

39:49.687 --> 39:51.488
Mm.

39:54.625 --> 39:56.826
(grunts)

39:56.828 --> 39:59.696
Do not seek to take
before I give.

40:03.701 --> 40:06.903
I'm glad to hear
you're thinking of giving.

40:09.006 --> 40:10.607
I've been looking for you.

40:10.609 --> 40:11.941
How's your husband?

40:13.577 --> 40:15.011
What is it?
What's wrong?

40:15.013 --> 40:17.614
You don't know?

40:19.049 --> 40:20.750
Francis signed the edict.

40:20.752 --> 40:23.787
That's not possible.

40:23.789 --> 40:26.022
What have you done?

40:26.024 --> 40:27.624
I did what I had to.

40:27.626 --> 40:29.025
Why?

40:29.027 --> 40:31.194
After telling me
you wouldn't sign.

40:31.196 --> 40:33.897
After telling me
you knew the edict was wrong.

40:33.899 --> 40:36.800
I realized that I could not rule

40:36.802 --> 40:38.935
Without the support
of my catholic nobles.

40:38.937 --> 40:41.504
Oh, spare me
your lies and excuses.

40:43.174 --> 40:45.141
You are not the man
I fell in love with.

40:45.143 --> 40:46.910
And you are not
the king I want to rule

40:46.912 --> 40:48.912
Beside-- you are a coward.

40:48.914 --> 40:51.881
Mary, everything
that I have done...

40:51.883 --> 40:53.683
Enough, enough.

40:53.685 --> 40:55.785
I gave you a chance.

40:55.787 --> 40:59.722
I waited for the man
I fell in love with to return.

40:59.724 --> 41:02.225
But that man is dead

41:02.227 --> 41:05.562
And I am finished
waiting for him.

41:06.864 --> 41:08.731
If that is what you
truly believe, then

41:08.733 --> 41:11.634
Perhaps you should
return to scotland.

41:13.771 --> 41:16.739
Leave me.

41:16.741 --> 41:19.175
Leave France.
