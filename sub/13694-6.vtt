WEBVTT

00:05.465 --> 00:07.260
Why did you give Duncan's job
to Jessica?

00:07.343 --> 00:08.803
Well, it was
his decision to leave,

00:08.886 --> 00:11.347
and I had to replace him
in the best interests
of the estate.

00:11.431 --> 00:13.224
And it's my job to manage,
and that's what I did.

00:13.307 --> 00:16.102
No, no, no. It's our job,
and you never consulted me.

00:16.184 --> 00:18.187
Oh, God, here we go again.

00:18.271 --> 00:20.356
Correct me if I'm wrong,
but I thought we were
running this place together

00:20.440 --> 00:21.691
as partners.

00:21.774 --> 00:24.027
Er, sorry. I'll...

00:26.237 --> 00:28.156
It's just Duncan's job.

00:28.239 --> 00:29.449
It's a side
of the estate business

00:29.532 --> 00:30.742
that you know
very little about.

00:30.824 --> 00:32.409
(SCOFFS)

00:32.493 --> 00:33.870
You just can't let go,
can you?

00:33.953 --> 00:35.830
How can you say that?

00:35.913 --> 00:37.790
I took you in,
I gave you a home,

00:37.874 --> 00:39.625
I gave you a job, a future...

00:39.709 --> 00:42.128
Yeah, maybe at the beginning
you felt you had to do
something out of guilt,

00:42.211 --> 00:44.505
or a sense of responsibility,
but deep down
you don't want me here.

00:44.589 --> 00:46.674
That is not how I feel at all.

00:46.758 --> 00:49.302
Isn't it? You don't
include me in anything.

00:49.385 --> 00:52.347
It seems all you're interested
in is putting me down
until you force me to leave.

00:52.430 --> 00:54.974
-How dare you!
You ungrateful...
-Bastard?

00:55.058 --> 00:58.311
Yeah, yeah, that's what I am,
isn't it, Archie?

00:58.394 --> 01:00.521
-Paul...
-I'm a fighter.
Been fighting all my life

01:01.606 --> 01:02.982
and I'm not leaving, Archie.

01:03.066 --> 01:04.108
What is going on?

01:04.691 --> 01:05.860
Brotherly love!

01:07.195 --> 01:08.237

02:02.834 --> 02:04.752
Whee!

02:04.836 --> 02:07.005
-Oh, and my hat box, yeah.
-There you are, pet!

02:07.088 --> 02:09.048
It's a Stephen Jones...

find her phone.

02:18.808 --> 02:20.184
Oh, bum!

02:23.521 --> 02:26.899
(SIGHING) I hate him.
I loathe him.

02:29.152 --> 02:30.570
He's the giddy limit.

02:30.653 --> 02:32.405
I hate him!

02:32.488 --> 02:34.741
Good morning, Molly!

02:34.824 --> 02:37.201
-Golly.
-Giving those weeds hell,
are you?

02:38.536 --> 02:40.121
Yes!

02:40.204 --> 02:42.832
I find it therapeutic.

02:42.915 --> 02:44.542
Especially when I feel
somewhat let down.

02:45.543 --> 02:46.627
Not by me, I hope?

02:46.711 --> 02:47.962
No, of course not.

02:49.088 --> 02:50.798
You're...

02:50.882 --> 02:52.884
You're as constant
as the North Star, Golly.

02:52.967 --> 02:54.260
We all know that.

02:55.303 --> 02:56.428
And I treasure you for it.

02:59.599 --> 03:01.017
-Oh!
-Here, here.

03:01.100 --> 03:03.019
The cause of my troubles
lies elsewhere.

03:04.103 --> 03:05.313
-(GASPING) Oh!
-What?

03:05.396 --> 03:06.397
(WHISPERING) It's him.

03:07.607 --> 03:09.525
The very last person
I want to see.

03:09.609 --> 03:11.319
Is that right?

03:11.402 --> 03:12.695
(WHISPERING)
Would you be a darling
and get rid of him for me?

03:13.237 --> 03:14.447
My pleasure.

-PAUL: Are you all right?
-What the hell
were you playing at?

03:37.178 --> 03:40.014
-I'm really sorry.
-Oh, you could have
killed both of us.

03:40.098 --> 03:43.226
-Can I help?
-Just get your hands off.

03:43.309 --> 03:45.812
If you want to do
something useful,
get me a double brandy.

03:45.895 --> 03:47.271
Armagnac for preference.

03:48.523 --> 03:49.524
Molly!

03:51.109 --> 03:52.235
Molly!

03:54.195 --> 03:55.780
Are you at home?

03:55.862 --> 03:58.032
Ah, it's yourself, Andrew.

03:58.116 --> 04:00.243
Oh, Golly.

04:00.326 --> 04:01.619
I was seeking
the lady of the house.

04:02.203 --> 04:04.080
Not available.

04:04.163 --> 04:06.332
Curious phrase.
Is she not at home, or...

04:06.416 --> 04:09.627
It would be the best
if you just accept
the answer I'm giving you.

04:09.711 --> 04:11.004
She doesn't want to see me?

04:11.087 --> 04:12.547
GOLLY: She's not available.

04:14.966 --> 04:15.967
I see.

04:16.926 --> 04:19.345
Thank you, Golly.

04:19.428 --> 04:23.474
Perhaps you'd tell Molly
that I'm sorry not to have
caught her.

04:25.768 --> 04:26.853
Andrew!

04:26.936 --> 04:27.936
I didn't know you were here.

04:28.979 --> 04:29.981
Come up.

04:34.193 --> 04:35.486
Available after all.

04:36.696 --> 04:38.114
To some, anyway.

04:46.205 --> 04:49.167
-It's the least I can do.
-Oh, thanks very much.

04:49.250 --> 04:52.795
Oh, no, my lovely hat!

04:52.879 --> 04:55.923
I'm sorry.
I'll get you another one.

04:56.007 --> 04:58.217
They've opened a branch
of Harvey Nicks in Glenbogle,
have they?

04:59.969 --> 05:01.554
I'll just have to use yours.

05:04.891 --> 05:06.976
-Oh, you've cut yourself.
-Have I?

05:07.060 --> 05:08.478
Oh, it must have been
when I...

05:13.107 --> 05:14.192
I think we'd better get going.

05:14.609 --> 05:15.693
Yeah.

05:15.777 --> 05:16.986
Before you knock
me over completely.

05:20.573 --> 05:22.033
We had, what seemed to me,

05:22.116 --> 05:24.327
a perfectly pleasant
and, in its way,

05:24.410 --> 05:26.996
rather sweet
few days together.

05:27.080 --> 05:28.873
We come home, and nothing.

05:28.956 --> 05:31.501
You don't visit,
you don't call, send flowers,

05:31.584 --> 05:33.503
not even a carrier pigeon.

05:33.586 --> 05:35.922
Your silence reverberates
from one end of the loch
to the other.

05:36.005 --> 05:37.715
-Molly.
-What?

05:37.799 --> 05:40.718
Be a good girl for a minute
and stop ranting like
a Stonehaven fishwife.

05:40.802 --> 05:43.429
-(EXHALING)
-There is a reason
why I went into purdah.

05:43.513 --> 05:44.889
Which is?

05:44.972 --> 05:46.349
I was thinking
about the future.

05:46.432 --> 05:47.516
(SIGHING)

05:47.600 --> 05:48.768
I wish people
wouldn't do that.

05:48.851 --> 05:50.103
Very little good comes of it.

05:50.186 --> 05:53.314
-Molly, I care deeply for you.
-Oh, lumme!

05:53.398 --> 05:55.983
I want us to spend
more time together.

05:56.067 --> 05:58.778
I know we can't live together.
You're not that kind of lady,

06:00.279 --> 06:02.573
And I swore to myself,
after the last fiasco,

06:02.657 --> 06:06.160
that I would never,
ever consider this again.

06:06.244 --> 06:07.327
-But...
-But.

06:07.412 --> 06:09.872
Little word. Big meaning.

06:09.956 --> 06:13.459
The hopeless specimen you see
before you is utterly smitten.

06:18.297 --> 06:21.759
Molly, will you marry me?

(TOOTING HORN)

06:28.558 --> 06:29.892
I'd better go
and see who it is.

06:29.976 --> 06:31.936
Maybe you could answer
my question first.

06:32.812 --> 06:33.813
Molly!

06:39.610 --> 06:40.778
(GASPING)

06:40.862 --> 06:43.281
Lizzie! And Martha!

06:45.700 --> 06:47.285
Molly!

06:47.368 --> 06:49.495
How nice to be
in Glenbogle again.

06:49.579 --> 06:51.414
Especially now there are
so many new attractions.

06:52.957 --> 06:54.584
Are you a friend
of Lexie's, then?

06:55.168 --> 06:56.294
Amongst others.

06:56.377 --> 06:59.088
-Anyway, I'm Paul.
-Oh.

06:59.172 --> 07:00.340
-I'm...
-Lizzie!

Mummy!

07:02.717 --> 07:03.843
Lizzie?

07:03.926 --> 07:06.137
Oh, look at you!

07:06.220 --> 07:08.639
-Oh, my little sweetheart.
-Well, well!

07:08.723 --> 07:10.058
Hello, little brother.

07:11.768 --> 07:13.603
And sister-in-law!

07:13.686 --> 07:15.438
Welcome home, Lizzie.

07:15.521 --> 07:18.358
-So you two have already met.
-Oh, we certainly have.

07:18.441 --> 07:19.859
ARCHIE: Have you told her?
LIZZIE: Told her what?

07:21.986 --> 07:23.988
Um, I think
we'd better go inside.

07:24.072 --> 07:27.033
Come on,
let's go on a biscuit hunt.

07:27.116 --> 07:29.535
-Molly?
-Oh, not just now, Andrew.

07:46.344 --> 07:47.887
I'm back, then.

07:55.269 --> 07:56.270
Brother?

07:58.189 --> 08:00.692
Half-brother,
to be strictly accurate.

08:00.775 --> 08:02.402
It's a long story.

08:02.485 --> 08:03.945
Well, try shortening it.

08:04.028 --> 08:07.365
-Well...
-The thing is, my darling,
your father...

08:07.448 --> 08:09.075
Oh, men are such complete...

08:09.158 --> 08:11.703
I think we'd better go
and have a quiet talk.

08:13.371 --> 08:15.123
Lex, I'm so sorry
I missed your wedding.

08:15.206 --> 08:18.835
It was on some blasted heath?
How eccentric.

08:18.918 --> 08:21.045
Special is a better word.

08:21.129 --> 08:22.964
Yeah, course.

08:23.047 --> 08:24.340
See you later, brother.

08:24.424 --> 08:25.425
-Okay.
-Okay.

08:27.051 --> 08:29.262
I think I'll leave you to it.

08:34.308 --> 08:35.308
I'm, er...

08:36.936 --> 08:38.229
I'm sorry about this morning.

08:39.772 --> 08:42.734
-Okay.
-No, I'm sorry.
It was unforgivable.

08:44.527 --> 08:45.903
Come with me
for a minute, will you?

08:49.073 --> 08:52.993
So, that's it, my dear.
Sorry little story.

08:53.077 --> 08:56.622
-But try not to think too
harshly of your poor father.
-I'm not.

08:56.706 --> 08:59.625
He was going through
a difficult period
in his life.

08:59.709 --> 09:02.377
In fact, he's rather gone up
in my estimation.

09:02.462 --> 09:04.213
-I'm sorry?
-Who'd have thought it, eh?

09:04.297 --> 09:05.840
The old dog.

09:05.923 --> 09:08.718
-Lizzie, there's no need
to go that far.
-Or is it a dark horse?

09:08.801 --> 09:11.304
My animal allusions
tend more to porcine.

09:11.387 --> 09:13.264
Mummy, there's a man
over there, waving at us.

09:13.973 --> 09:15.266
No. There isn't.

09:15.350 --> 09:16.434
Yes, there is! Look!

09:16.517 --> 09:18.770
-Who is he?
-Um, a neighbour.

09:18.853 --> 09:21.439
-(STAMMERING)
Andrew something or other.
-Oh, let's go and meet him.

09:21.522 --> 09:24.484
No, no, you're far too upset
about this revelation
about your father.

09:24.567 --> 09:26.361
No, no, I'm not.
He looks rather nice.

09:26.444 --> 09:28.404
-Fiddlesticks!
-Mummy?

09:28.488 --> 09:31.282
You protest too much.
You two are an item.

09:31.366 --> 09:32.700
-Nonsense.
-Have you done the deed?

09:33.326 --> 09:34.577
Lizzie! Enough!

09:35.953 --> 09:38.873
Now, tell me why you're here.

09:38.956 --> 09:42.627
It's lovely to see you
and darling Martha, but what
exactly are you up to?

09:42.710 --> 09:43.920
Nothing!

09:44.003 --> 09:46.089
I've just come to see you.

09:46.172 --> 09:48.216
Tell you some of the things
that've been happening
in my life.

09:48.299 --> 09:50.551
-Must you?
-And my plans for the future.

09:50.635 --> 09:53.971
Oh, Elizabeth,
you haven't joined
another sect, have you?

09:54.514 --> 09:55.515
Mummy!

09:57.350 --> 09:59.268
When we were children, Lizzie
was a bit of a tomboy.

10:00.269 --> 10:02.397
Yeah, I can see that.

10:02.480 --> 10:05.400
She always wanted to join
in the rough and tumble stuff
with Jamie and me.

10:07.110 --> 10:09.237
I think we froze her out.

10:10.363 --> 10:12.281
And now?

10:12.365 --> 10:15.576
Well, to be perfectly honest,
I don't really know
Lizzie at all.

10:17.662 --> 10:22.834
Relationships in families
sometimes get trapped,
don't they?

10:22.917 --> 10:26.379
PAUL: I don't have much
experience of families,
but I guess so, yeah.

10:26.462 --> 10:28.089
Look, what I'm trying
to say is,

10:29.716 --> 10:32.010
you never knew Jamie,

10:32.093 --> 10:33.678
and he's gone
from my life now.

10:35.096 --> 10:36.889
But, for both of us,

10:36.973 --> 10:39.392
when it comes to brothers,

10:39.475 --> 10:41.894
-there's only one
left in stock.
-Yeah.

10:44.397 --> 10:45.815
Let's make it work, Paul.

10:46.941 --> 10:48.151
However hard it might be,

10:49.986 --> 10:51.654
for ourselves, for our father.

10:54.490 --> 10:55.491
I suppose

10:56.659 --> 10:58.077
we both belong here,
don't we?

10:58.911 --> 10:59.912
Yeah.

11:02.832 --> 11:03.875
Fresh start, then.

11:05.501 --> 11:06.544
Fresh start.

11:09.380 --> 11:10.548
Come here.

11:18.765 --> 11:20.183
It's good of you
to put me up though, you know.

11:20.266 --> 11:21.601
It's just till
I get my act together,
you know.

11:21.684 --> 11:24.312
Or until you reach 50.
Whichever comes first.

11:24.395 --> 11:26.814
-Eh?
-You are a numpty.

11:26.898 --> 11:28.358
Leaving a good job
you had here.

11:29.650 --> 11:31.361
Huh?

11:31.444 --> 11:32.612
Good to see you back,
though, son.

11:34.280 --> 11:36.949
Thanks. Where else would I go?

11:37.033 --> 11:38.910
Listen, you know that
Jessica's staying, so...

11:38.993 --> 11:40.370
We'll have to share
the spare bed.

11:44.791 --> 11:45.792
Sorry, Golly,

11:47.043 --> 11:48.252
don't know why I said that.

11:49.087 --> 11:50.129
Hmm.

11:56.135 --> 11:57.261
You look nice.

11:58.805 --> 12:00.264
Silver service!

12:01.557 --> 12:03.768
-In your honour.
-Well, let me help.

12:05.937 --> 12:08.022
Mummy seems okay.

12:08.106 --> 12:11.025
Coping with widowhood,
merry or otherwise.

12:12.527 --> 12:14.195
Yes.

12:14.278 --> 12:17.949
What happened was so awful.

12:18.032 --> 12:20.952
She was the one
who kept everyone else going.

12:21.035 --> 12:23.621
I tried to put it all
in that letter to you.
Did you get it?

12:24.997 --> 12:27.083
Months later.
I was travelling
in the Sahara.

12:29.210 --> 12:32.255
We thought you were in India.
That's what you told us.

12:32.338 --> 12:33.715
Are you angry with me, Archie?

12:33.798 --> 12:35.842
-No.
-Well, you seem to be.

12:35.925 --> 12:36.926
Well, I'm not.

12:38.261 --> 12:40.263
Why do you always
do this to me, Archie?

12:40.346 --> 12:42.432
-Every time I come home.
-Do what?

12:42.515 --> 12:45.184
Make me feel bad, inadequate.

12:45.268 --> 12:47.812
Same old judgemental Archie.

12:47.895 --> 12:49.188
Is this what you do to Paul?

12:50.815 --> 12:52.025
Bit close to the bone, eh?

12:52.108 --> 12:54.736
Look, I don't want a row
today of all days,

12:54.819 --> 12:57.530
but has it ever occurred
to you that you might do
something to me?

12:57.613 --> 12:58.656
What do you mean?

12:58.740 --> 13:01.534
You offload
your problems on me.

13:01.617 --> 13:03.161
You think that
I'm angry with you.
Well, I'm not.

13:03.244 --> 13:05.705
-You're angry with yourself.
-(SCOFFING)

13:05.788 --> 13:08.541
-Maybe you feel guilty
about something.
-Oh, don't be ridiculous!

13:09.250 --> 13:10.626
Close to the bone, eh?

13:10.710 --> 13:12.128
I hate you sometimes.

13:12.211 --> 13:14.339
Don't shout, Lizzie.
It just proves that I'm right.

13:14.422 --> 13:16.090
It just proves you're smug.

13:16.174 --> 13:17.633
LEXIE: Right!

13:17.717 --> 13:19.761
Oh, for heaven's sake!

13:19.844 --> 13:23.348
Molly's gonna be down
any minute and you're both
arguing like children.

13:24.474 --> 13:26.059
(PHONE RINGING)

13:26.893 --> 13:28.144
I'll get that.

13:32.023 --> 13:33.066
Evening!

13:34.359 --> 13:36.194
Why do we do this
to each other, Archie?

13:43.576 --> 13:44.619
Duncan?

13:46.746 --> 13:47.872
You've got stuff on your chin.

13:48.873 --> 13:50.083
Have I? Where? Here?

13:50.792 --> 13:51.793
(CLEARS THROAT)

13:52.502 --> 13:53.544
Here?

13:54.003 --> 13:55.838
Duncan!

13:55.922 --> 13:59.509
It is grand having you both
at my table and under my roof.
A toast.

14:01.636 --> 14:03.262
-To a full house.
-A full house.

14:03.346 --> 14:04.389
A full house.

14:07.475 --> 14:09.769
I've been on my own
for far too long.

14:10.895 --> 14:12.146
-What a waste, eh?
-(SIGHING)

14:14.607 --> 14:15.775
Never too late though,
eh, Dad?

14:16.859 --> 14:18.403
Maybe not.

14:18.486 --> 14:19.612
Probably, though.

14:21.114 --> 14:22.156
Duncan!

14:22.240 --> 14:23.783
(CHUCKLING)

14:24.867 --> 14:25.868
Wait for this.

14:28.663 --> 14:30.164
Jelly and custard!

14:36.671 --> 14:38.881
Don't worry.
It'll be all right
in the morning.

14:39.674 --> 14:41.467
Hmm.

14:41.551 --> 14:42.927
If only it was that simple.

14:46.806 --> 14:47.807
(SIGHING)

15:05.491 --> 15:07.160
Molly!

15:07.243 --> 15:10.621
I used to take your mummy
for a ride in this
when she was little.

15:10.705 --> 15:11.914
And Uncle Archie.

15:12.707 --> 15:14.208
There we go.

15:14.292 --> 15:17.545
Right, we're off
to see a friend.

15:22.675 --> 15:24.969
-Morning, Molly.
-Morning, Golly.

15:34.562 --> 15:35.730
Excuse me.

15:42.403 --> 15:43.571
Out of my way, son.

15:44.072 --> 15:45.073
(SIGHS)

15:48.826 --> 15:50.370
Duncan!

15:50.453 --> 15:52.872
-What?
-You're getting in my wires.

15:52.955 --> 15:54.624
I've nothing to do.

15:54.707 --> 15:57.460
Well, you could start
by looking for another job.

15:57.543 --> 15:59.420
Oh, and the world
is crying out

15:59.504 --> 16:02.799
for another deputy assistant
head ranger gillie
with no other qualifications

16:02.882 --> 16:05.093
or experience.

16:05.176 --> 16:06.594
If you've got
nothing better to do,

16:06.678 --> 16:08.012
this floor needs washing.

16:09.806 --> 16:11.182
Uh, that is woman's work.

16:12.558 --> 16:15.520
-I'm away to read a book.
-Duncan.

16:15.603 --> 16:18.189
There's ones with nice
pictures up in Archie's
old nursery.

16:21.150 --> 16:22.694
-Hi.
-Hi, Lex!

16:22.777 --> 16:24.153
Morning!

16:25.488 --> 16:28.199
-There we are. Breakfast.
-(EXHALING)

16:28.282 --> 16:30.410
Oh, just some dried fruit.

16:30.493 --> 16:31.494
Lovely.

16:33.579 --> 16:35.164
Right.

16:35.248 --> 16:36.666
(BICYCLE BELL RINGING)

16:47.385 --> 16:49.470
ANDREW: Welcome.

16:49.554 --> 16:52.432
You look a bit rough,
if you don't mind
my saying so.

16:52.515 --> 16:55.518
I didn't sleep.
I haven't felt like this
since I was 20.

16:55.601 --> 16:57.437
Oh, Andrew,

16:57.520 --> 16:59.856
I rather left you
hanging yesterday.

16:59.939 --> 17:02.025
You need an answer
and this probably

17:02.108 --> 17:04.694
isn't the one
that you want to hear, but...

17:04.777 --> 17:06.029
Oh, dear.

17:06.112 --> 17:07.739
I haven't been able
to make up my mind.

17:08.489 --> 17:10.074
Oh, that's all right.

17:10.157 --> 17:12.660
Well, what with
Lizzie arriving
and various family things...

17:12.743 --> 17:14.537
-I understand.
-Not to mention

17:14.619 --> 17:19.625
my complete inability
to decide what it is
that I really want.

17:19.709 --> 17:21.586
Please don't pressurise me.

17:21.669 --> 17:24.839
If you do,
I'm liable to say no.

17:24.922 --> 17:28.718
Take your time.
Much better to make the right
decision than a hurried one.

17:28.801 --> 17:30.053
It isn't fair
to keep you waiting.

17:30.136 --> 17:31.679
But tomorrow...

17:31.763 --> 17:33.264
Come and see me tomorrow.

17:34.265 --> 17:36.059
Try and get some rest.

17:37.435 --> 17:39.354
Martha,

17:39.437 --> 17:41.898
let's go and get
some breakfast. Good girl.

17:43.399 --> 17:45.276
You're a wonderful woman,
Molly!

17:45.985 --> 17:47.194
(GIGGLING)

17:47.278 --> 17:49.447
Lex, I'm sorry
about last night. I...

17:49.529 --> 17:51.574
Didn't mean to be rude.

17:51.657 --> 17:53.950
Just, Archie winds me up
something rotten.

17:54.035 --> 17:55.786
Mmm, it's okay.

17:55.870 --> 17:57.370
He has that effect
on me sometimes.

17:57.455 --> 17:59.499
-(CHUCKLING)
-(CHUCKLING) Thanks, Lex.

18:00.917 --> 18:02.793
I do so want to be
your friend.

18:04.754 --> 18:06.506
Lizzie?

18:06.589 --> 18:07.882
Lizzie, what's the matter?

18:10.385 --> 18:11.469
It's Martha.

18:12.261 --> 18:13.513
Martha?

18:13.596 --> 18:15.348
-She's not ill, is she?
-No, no.

18:16.766 --> 18:17.767
No, it's just...

18:19.977 --> 18:21.354
Her father.

18:21.437 --> 18:24.524
Well, we're no longer
together. He's, umm...

18:24.607 --> 18:29.904
He's married
to an absolute witch.
I hate her.

18:29.987 --> 18:34.200
Anyway, Stefan is an architect
and, umm...

18:35.243 --> 18:37.954
He's got a job on in Tuscany.

18:38.037 --> 18:41.666
He wants to take Martha
and his other kids out there
for a few months.

18:41.749 --> 18:44.877
Oh, well,
that's good, isn't it?

18:44.961 --> 18:47.088
That he wants her
to be part of his family?

18:47.922 --> 18:48.923
Yes.

18:50.341 --> 18:51.467
It's just...

18:52.468 --> 18:53.636
It's me...

18:54.512 --> 18:55.555
My life...

18:56.723 --> 18:57.890
It's a mess.

18:59.017 --> 19:01.019
No job.

19:01.102 --> 19:03.104
I haven't got a home,
except this one.

19:05.148 --> 19:07.358
Martha's the only structure
I have.

19:08.443 --> 19:09.986
Without her...

19:10.069 --> 19:11.821
-You feel like
it'll all fall apart?
-Exactly.

19:16.993 --> 19:18.786
Well, maybe...

19:20.705 --> 19:21.956
Maybe...

19:22.040 --> 19:23.207
Maybe you should get away.

19:24.834 --> 19:26.753
While Martha's in Italy.

19:26.836 --> 19:28.755
Just get right away.

19:28.838 --> 19:31.632
You can set yourself
a challenge.

19:31.716 --> 19:33.885
Oh, Lex, I love you to bits.

19:33.968 --> 19:36.054
That is exactly my plan!

19:38.056 --> 19:40.099
I knew you'd understand.

19:40.183 --> 19:42.268
What am I going to do
about me and Arch?

19:42.352 --> 19:43.978
That's just the same thing.

19:44.062 --> 19:46.439
You just need something
that'll break the pattern.

19:48.483 --> 19:49.525
That's perfect.

19:50.401 --> 19:52.737
Oh, Lex,

19:52.820 --> 19:55.198
I can't tell you how much
it means to have your support!

19:57.200 --> 19:58.910
What? Support for what?

20:06.084 --> 20:07.919
I was wondering

20:08.002 --> 20:09.921
if there was anything
we could do about Duncan.

20:10.588 --> 20:11.714
I'm glad.

20:11.798 --> 20:14.717
But what? That's what
I'm trying to work out.

20:14.801 --> 20:16.511
-Well...
-(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

20:16.594 --> 20:17.720
Come in.

20:18.763 --> 20:20.181
Sorry to butt in.

20:23.434 --> 20:26.396
Uh, I just came to say
I can't carry on with the job.

20:28.147 --> 20:30.233
Don't say anything.
My mind's made up.

20:31.401 --> 20:33.611
I can't take Duncan's job.

20:33.695 --> 20:37.865
Jessica, when Archie gave you
Duncan's old job,

20:37.949 --> 20:39.701
he already had one, okay?

20:39.784 --> 20:42.704
-He left here.
-I just can't do it.

20:42.787 --> 20:44.539
It'd be like stabbing
a mate in the back.

20:45.748 --> 20:46.916
I'm sorry.

20:54.632 --> 20:55.925
In a way,

20:56.968 --> 20:58.011
problem solved.

20:58.553 --> 21:00.054
She said that?

21:00.138 --> 21:02.098
Yeah, we tried
reasoning with her
but she just wouldn't have it.

21:02.181 --> 21:03.266
She did that for me?

21:03.850 --> 21:05.184
So, Duncan...

21:06.978 --> 21:08.896
She's really nice, Jess,
isn't she?

21:08.980 --> 21:10.982
You can have
your old job back.

21:11.065 --> 21:12.275
-What?
-Start whenever you like.

21:12.984 --> 21:14.318
Fantastic!

21:17.071 --> 21:18.322
Ah, wait a minute, though.

21:22.076 --> 21:23.661
-No, I couldn't.
-Why not?

21:23.745 --> 21:25.538
What, after she...

21:25.621 --> 21:27.373
It'd be like stabbing
your mate in the back.

21:27.457 --> 21:29.959
Duncan, are you doolally,
or what?

21:30.043 --> 21:31.878
No, I'm sorry gentlemen,

21:31.961 --> 21:33.421
I'm going to have
to decline your offer.

21:34.881 --> 21:35.923
Good day.

21:37.216 --> 21:38.593
MOLLY: Arch?

21:40.803 --> 21:43.264
Arch! Are you there?

21:43.348 --> 21:45.350
Ooh, Lexie, Lexie,

21:48.102 --> 21:49.395
I need a consultation.

21:50.938 --> 21:52.357
Neither of them will take it.

21:53.107 --> 21:54.901
So?

21:54.984 --> 21:57.612
-We just thought...
-We thought you might
have some ideas.

21:57.695 --> 22:00.406
Well, I hope
you're not asking me
to express a preference here?

22:00.490 --> 22:03.951
No, of course not. We just
thought you might be able to
help us break the deadlock.

22:04.035 --> 22:05.995
Uh, it is a bit of a mess,
right enough,

22:06.079 --> 22:08.748
but, a month, a year,
it's hardly gonna
matter a damn.

22:10.458 --> 22:11.876
I'm sorry, Golly.
I don't understand.

22:11.959 --> 22:14.879
No, I'm sorry,
I can't advise you.

22:14.962 --> 22:16.339
I've got other things
on my mind,

22:16.422 --> 22:19.175
things that can
change a person's life,
maybe even two.

22:19.258 --> 22:20.927
I'm sorry
but you'll just have
to excuse me.

22:23.513 --> 22:24.555
PAUL: What on earth?

22:26.516 --> 22:28.226
-So, plan B.
-Yep.

22:28.309 --> 22:30.103
You talk to Duncan,
I'll talk to Jess.

22:30.186 --> 22:31.437
Okay, what shall I say?

22:31.521 --> 22:33.356
-Tell him to accept it and
just to get on with it.

22:33.439 --> 22:34.440
-So...
-LEXIE: (SCREAMING) Oh! Oh!

22:35.817 --> 22:37.193
Molly, no!

22:37.276 --> 22:40.780
(LAUGHING) That's fantastic!

22:40.863 --> 22:42.448
-Is it really?
-You don't think so?

22:43.074 --> 22:44.117
What's wrong?

22:45.660 --> 22:47.036
-Somebody screamed.
-Uh...

22:47.120 --> 22:49.580
(CHUCKLES)
No, no, nobody screamed.

22:49.664 --> 22:52.417
Me and Molly are just
having a wee girly chat.

22:52.500 --> 22:54.210
So, away with the pair of you.

22:55.086 --> 22:57.672
Right. Uh, Molly,

22:57.755 --> 23:00.508
Molly, I'd really like to
speak to you about something.
Could we...

23:00.591 --> 23:03.344
Well, I'm a bit preoccupied
at the moment, but yes.

23:03.428 --> 23:06.097
Well, how about tomorrow then?
First thing?

23:06.180 --> 23:08.266
-Fine.
-Okay, I'll see you then.

23:10.727 --> 23:11.894
Do you love Andrew?

23:13.104 --> 23:14.188
I don't know.

23:14.272 --> 23:17.275
-(STAMMERING) I'm fond of him.
-But?

23:17.358 --> 23:19.902
-Well, I'm worried about
what Archie will think,
and Lizzie.

23:19.986 --> 23:21.279
Don't!

23:21.362 --> 23:24.490
Look, this is your life,
not theirs.

23:24.574 --> 23:27.326
They just...
They want you to be happy.

23:30.121 --> 23:31.247
Aw, Molly!

23:34.500 --> 23:36.210
The thing is, Jess,

23:36.294 --> 23:40.131
we need to discuss
the issues surrounding
this job situation.

23:40.214 --> 23:43.343
I may have to knock
some sense into your
thick skull.

23:43.426 --> 23:44.927
I admire the position
that you've taken.

23:45.011 --> 23:47.930
It shows compassion
and integrity.

23:48.014 --> 23:51.726
You're behaving like a clown!
The only thing you're missing
is a pair of joke shoes.

23:51.809 --> 23:54.103
But now we need
to move forward,

23:54.187 --> 23:55.438
for the sake of the estate

23:55.521 --> 23:58.691
-and all the people
committed to its future.
-Okay.

23:58.775 --> 24:01.194
You need to pull
your finger out
and do your duty.

24:01.277 --> 24:03.029
Archie needs your support,

24:03.112 --> 24:05.365
not your hand-wringing,
namby-pamby gestures.

24:05.448 --> 24:08.159
It would be a fulfilment
of your father's dream,

24:08.242 --> 24:11.579
to see you here,
working alongside him.

24:11.662 --> 24:13.790
Now don't worry about Jessica,
Archie's dealing with her.

24:13.873 --> 24:17.627
Just stop fannying about
like the complete prat you are
and take this job, right!

24:17.710 --> 24:19.504
I'm really touched, Archie.

24:20.838 --> 24:23.091
-Thank you.
-That's wonderful, Jess.

24:23.174 --> 24:24.550
-Okay.
-Right.

24:24.634 --> 24:26.302
This time you sign a contract,

24:26.386 --> 24:27.970
in your own blood
if necessary.

24:28.054 --> 24:29.305
Now, let's go and see Archie.

24:38.314 --> 24:39.524
-Great news!
-Great news.

24:39.607 --> 24:41.109
-Jess has taken the job.
-What?

24:41.859 --> 24:43.319
So has Duncan.

24:43.403 --> 24:44.862
-Oh, no, if she wants it...
-But I can't take it if he...

24:44.946 --> 24:47.532
-Oh, for goodness sake!
-Shut it, Duncan.

24:47.615 --> 24:49.867
Okay, okay. Look I don't know
how this happened,

24:49.951 --> 24:53.162
but for the last time
will one of you please
just take this job?

24:53.246 --> 24:55.039
No, it belongs to him.

24:57.250 --> 24:58.418
Absolutely not!

24:59.419 --> 25:00.545
It's hers by right.

25:05.591 --> 25:07.010
-I don't believe this.
-How exactly did this happen?

25:07.093 --> 25:08.302
I mean, what were you
playing at?

25:09.095 --> 25:10.138
Come on.

25:14.392 --> 25:15.768
Wait till I'm at the bottom.

25:17.186 --> 25:18.187
Ready.

25:19.272 --> 25:20.314
Yay!

25:21.357 --> 25:23.109
Ooh, Archie,
can you spare a minute?

25:24.527 --> 25:26.779
Obviously not. Later, Lizzie.

25:26.863 --> 25:28.698
You asked me
to get Duncan to accept it.

25:28.781 --> 25:31.576
-Yes, that's why...
-That's why I bullied him
into taking the job.

25:32.326 --> 25:34.162
(STAMMERING)

25:34.245 --> 25:36.080
I meant that he
couldn't expect to
simply walk back in here.

25:36.164 --> 25:37.665
Jessica had already started!

25:37.749 --> 25:39.375
But you didn't
make that clear.

25:39.459 --> 25:43.713
Well, I was distracted
by Golly and then Lexie
shouted, you remember.

25:45.631 --> 25:48.176
This is all beside the point.

25:48.259 --> 25:50.303
This whole mess
has come about from you

25:52.305 --> 25:54.807
trying to create a job for me
where there isn't one.

25:54.891 --> 25:56.642
Look, before you
start banging on
about your rights again...

25:56.726 --> 25:58.728
I'm not. I'm not.

25:58.811 --> 26:00.396
You've been
good to me, Archie.
I know that.

26:00.480 --> 26:04.776
You've tried,
and I'm very grateful,
but it won't work.

26:04.859 --> 26:07.236
And if we push it any further,
it's gonna damage us.

26:08.863 --> 26:10.198
And damage the family.

26:15.828 --> 26:16.913
So, what are we going to do?

26:18.664 --> 26:20.041
Maybe I should just go.

26:20.124 --> 26:22.543
-Oh, Paul, you can't...
-I don't want to.

26:22.627 --> 26:23.961
This is my home now.

26:26.047 --> 26:28.049
But I think it would be
for the best.

26:28.132 --> 26:29.217
For everyone.

26:30.718 --> 26:32.136
You and me, especially.

26:35.306 --> 26:36.808
Where's Lizzie?

26:36.891 --> 26:39.560
Um, she's upstairs.
Just putting Martha to bed.

26:39.644 --> 26:40.895
She said
she wasn't very hungry.

26:42.689 --> 26:44.107
I'll take her a glass of wine.

26:44.190 --> 26:45.983
Oh, half a glass, dear.

26:46.067 --> 26:47.694
She's grown-up, Mother.

26:47.777 --> 26:49.654
She can look after herself,
can't she?

26:49.737 --> 26:52.365
Yes, yes, of course,
we all have to make
our own journeys, don't we?

26:59.664 --> 27:00.748
Excuse me.

27:03.710 --> 27:05.211
Archie!

27:05.294 --> 27:06.629
I...

27:06.713 --> 27:09.424
I'd like a wee word,
if that's okay?

27:09.507 --> 27:10.508
Yeah, fine.

27:11.551 --> 27:14.012
Um...

27:14.095 --> 27:18.307
Well, maybe tomorrow morning.
It's a bit personal.

27:18.391 --> 27:20.893
-Are you not eating?
-Eating?

27:22.562 --> 27:24.564
Uh, no. No, no. I'll just...

27:26.274 --> 27:28.109
No, I'm just off to my bed.

27:29.360 --> 27:31.279
Night, son.

27:31.362 --> 27:33.031
Are you okay, Golly?

27:34.198 --> 27:35.742
I'll tell you tomorrow.

27:42.790 --> 27:44.667
(GIGGLING)

27:44.751 --> 27:46.002
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

27:52.884 --> 27:54.886
-I brought you this.
-Oh, thanks!

27:56.721 --> 27:57.930
Mmm!

27:59.599 --> 28:01.100
(SIGHING)

28:01.184 --> 28:03.728
-So, how are things?
-Archie, I can drink a glass
of Chardonnay

28:03.811 --> 28:05.897
without triggering
a three-day bender.

28:05.980 --> 28:07.148
That's not what I meant.

28:08.441 --> 28:09.484
Sorry.

28:10.902 --> 28:13.780
-Okay, honestly.
-Good.

28:16.032 --> 28:17.950
Come on, poppet.

28:18.034 --> 28:19.660
Still searching,

28:21.412 --> 28:23.664
not quite so desperately.

28:23.748 --> 28:26.209
I don't think
I'll be visiting
an ashram again.

28:27.001 --> 28:28.252
Or a psychoanalyst.

28:30.046 --> 28:32.090
Did I tell you,
I tried to do away
with myself.

28:33.257 --> 28:35.009
-Lizzie!
-It's all right.

28:35.968 --> 28:37.136
It wasn't very convincing.

28:38.137 --> 28:39.472
Classic attention seeking.

28:41.599 --> 28:42.975
Stefan found me.

28:43.810 --> 28:46.062
Well, it was about him.

28:46.145 --> 28:47.897
Afterwards, I said to myself,

28:48.815 --> 28:50.650
"Elizabeth, this won't do,

28:50.733 --> 28:52.193
"you have
responsibilities now."

28:55.947 --> 28:59.200
So, I no longer feel
I'm teetering on the edge
of a cliff.

29:00.410 --> 29:01.994
I'm standing
a couple of paces back.

29:04.497 --> 29:05.790
Is there anything I can do?

29:08.126 --> 29:09.377
As a matter of fact, there is.

29:11.254 --> 29:12.463
Let me get her down first.

29:16.426 --> 29:17.468
(WHISPERING) Good girl!

29:21.264 --> 29:22.432
MARTHA: Good night, Mummy!

29:29.230 --> 29:31.065
You said I was feeling guilty
about something.

29:32.900 --> 29:33.901
You were right.

29:35.820 --> 29:37.530
When I got back
from my last trip,

29:38.448 --> 29:39.699
this was waiting for me.

29:41.284 --> 29:42.744
It followed me
all over Africa.

29:44.203 --> 29:45.538
It's a letter from Father.

29:46.831 --> 29:48.249
He'd written it the day
before he died.

29:50.209 --> 29:51.836
You're kidding.

29:51.919 --> 29:53.504
And apart from banging on
about a pike,

29:53.588 --> 29:55.298
it's the most
wonderful letter.

29:56.090 --> 29:58.676
Serene and tender.

29:58.760 --> 30:00.511
He talks about
climbing a mountain

30:02.013 --> 30:04.474
in, uh... In India,

30:04.557 --> 30:06.184
when he was in the Army.

30:06.267 --> 30:08.436
One of the most amazing
weeks of his life, he said.

30:09.687 --> 30:10.897
Listen.

30:12.357 --> 30:15.443
"Maybe one of these days,
I'll climb it again,

30:15.526 --> 30:19.614
"with you and Archie
beside me.

30:22.325 --> 30:23.618
"Then again, maybe not.

30:25.119 --> 30:26.913
"There probably
isn't the time."

30:30.166 --> 30:31.626
Oh, Lizzie.

30:31.709 --> 30:34.754
Archie, Martha's spending
the summer with her father,

30:34.837 --> 30:37.423
and I want to go
to that mountain.

30:38.591 --> 30:40.510
It's not very high, but...

30:40.593 --> 30:44.097
It's holy and it would
make a fine quest.

30:46.391 --> 30:47.684
Okay.

30:47.767 --> 30:49.102
And I want you
to come with me.

30:50.228 --> 30:52.063
-Me?
-Think of it, Archie.

30:52.146 --> 30:54.273
It would be like a pilgrimage.

30:54.357 --> 30:56.859
Yeah, but I've got
an estate to run.
Responsibilities.

30:56.943 --> 30:58.361
You see,

30:58.444 --> 31:00.405
I'm not really sure
I ever knew Father.

31:00.488 --> 31:02.657
And I don't know if you did.

31:04.575 --> 31:07.745
But maybe up there
on that mountain,

31:09.414 --> 31:10.581
we'll find him

31:12.458 --> 31:14.210
and Jamie.

31:14.293 --> 31:16.254
(SOBBING) And maybe...

31:18.214 --> 31:19.424
Maybe each other.

31:21.676 --> 31:24.053
We've never really been
that close, have we, Archie?

31:26.389 --> 31:27.682
Isn't that a shame?

31:29.600 --> 31:30.810
Oh, Lizzie!

31:33.646 --> 31:34.731
I can't.

31:36.357 --> 31:37.984
I'm sorry.
I can't leave Glenbogle.

31:39.527 --> 31:40.820
I see.

31:41.946 --> 31:44.240
"Then again, maybe not.

31:44.323 --> 31:45.825
"There probably
isn't the time."

31:52.498 --> 31:53.708
He's here, you know.

31:54.917 --> 31:56.252
Where he belongs.

31:59.464 --> 32:01.215
I'll take you
to his grave tomorrow.

32:02.925 --> 32:04.135
I should like that.

32:28.284 --> 32:30.912
I mean, she seriously
expected me to just
drop everything

32:30.995 --> 32:32.080
and go off with her.

32:33.539 --> 32:34.957
(SIGHING)

32:35.041 --> 32:38.127
Hmm. Lizzie isn't the problem,
though.

32:38.211 --> 32:41.506
I just can't see a way
of sorting things out
with Paul.

32:42.632 --> 32:43.966
You'll find a way,

32:45.051 --> 32:46.636
and I'll support you.

32:46.719 --> 32:48.554
You know that, whatever.

32:54.644 --> 32:57.021
Then there's Golly.
I don't know
what's the matter with him.

32:59.899 --> 33:00.983
Unless...

33:02.110 --> 33:03.236
What?

33:06.030 --> 33:09.075
Well, he's been very strange
the past couple of days,

33:09.158 --> 33:11.285
talking about his future
and his happiness.

33:13.329 --> 33:14.497
No, it can't be!

33:16.874 --> 33:17.959
Archie, what?

33:19.293 --> 33:20.545
Well, you don't think...

33:22.171 --> 33:24.090
You don't think
he wanted to talk
about Mother?

33:25.174 --> 33:26.718
I mean, you know.

33:28.094 --> 33:30.013
No, it could be.

33:30.096 --> 33:31.973
He's worshipped her for years.

33:32.056 --> 33:34.392
-No.
-(CHUCKLING) Yes!

33:34.475 --> 33:36.310
As plain as the nose
on your face.

33:40.064 --> 33:41.065
Arch,

33:44.193 --> 33:47.280
this is breaking a confidence,

33:47.363 --> 33:51.284
and, well, she's probably
going to turn him
down anyway, but,

33:51.367 --> 33:53.202
I think there's something
you should know.

34:00.251 --> 34:01.919
Have you ever been to Nepal?

34:24.692 --> 34:25.985
Thanks for bringing me here.

34:29.655 --> 34:30.947
It's a lovely place.

34:34.786 --> 34:36.411
Is he here, do you think?

34:45.338 --> 34:48.049
I wish I could make it
all right for you, Lizzie.

34:50.342 --> 34:51.511
I know.

34:54.054 --> 34:55.264
You would if you could.

34:58.768 --> 35:00.061
I'm sorry I let you down.

35:05.149 --> 35:08.528
Chances like this
don't come along
very often, Archie.

35:42.437 --> 35:44.439
(EXHALES)

35:44.522 --> 35:45.982
I really don't know
how to say this.

35:47.315 --> 35:48.316
Is it about my mother?

35:50.111 --> 35:51.154
Yeah.

35:52.697 --> 35:53.823
Come on.

36:11.382 --> 36:14.802
It's not a good time
to think about this.

36:14.885 --> 36:17.512
With Lizzie home,
not being settled.

36:18.681 --> 36:21.601
And all this business
with Paul.

36:21.683 --> 36:25.021
Should their problems
dictate the course
of your life?

36:25.104 --> 36:29.233
They're my children.
Well, not Paul, obviously
but you know what I mean.

36:29.317 --> 36:31.903
Forgive me.
This all sounds
like an excuse.

36:31.986 --> 36:34.614
Take a deep breath
and tell me what
you really think about us.

36:36.491 --> 36:37.700
Very well.

36:41.371 --> 36:43.122
I'm really not sure
that I'm ready.

36:51.214 --> 36:52.799
I had this dream
the other night.

36:55.093 --> 36:56.511
It was about Molly's funeral.

36:58.388 --> 36:59.806
I hope that doesn't
upset you, son.

37:03.643 --> 37:06.437
Anyway, so I dreamt
I was in church,

37:08.356 --> 37:11.609
listening to you saying
what a marvellous
person she was,

37:13.861 --> 37:15.488
and all I could
think about was

37:16.572 --> 37:18.074
how I'd never told her

37:20.034 --> 37:21.035
how I felt for her.

37:22.161 --> 37:23.621
(THUMPING CHEST) In here.

37:27.250 --> 37:29.002
I see.

37:29.085 --> 37:30.586
She's a wonderful woman.

37:32.338 --> 37:33.589
In every way.

37:37.218 --> 37:38.553
So?

37:41.014 --> 37:44.684
Uh, son, I have been
a spectator all my life.

37:46.644 --> 37:49.230
I've watched my existence
just drift by

37:50.606 --> 37:51.941
until it's almost too late.

37:54.569 --> 37:55.653
No more.

37:57.071 --> 37:59.574
I have to do something.
I have to...

38:02.910 --> 38:04.954
I have to tell her
how much she means to me.

38:08.082 --> 38:09.167
That I love her.

38:13.087 --> 38:14.630
But I wanted to say that

38:16.424 --> 38:18.801
I know I could never
take your father's place.

38:23.890 --> 38:25.600
In many ways,
you are my father.

38:27.602 --> 38:29.812
You'll never know how much
it means to hear you say that.

38:33.399 --> 38:34.776
I have your blessing, then?

38:49.916 --> 38:51.459
-Good luck.
-Thank you.

38:52.460 --> 38:54.545
But go now.

38:54.629 --> 38:57.131
-Why do you say that?
-I can't tell you why.
Just go.

39:00.009 --> 39:01.177
Okay.

39:16.484 --> 39:18.778
Well, were we right?

39:23.366 --> 39:24.617
I need to talk to you

39:26.869 --> 39:27.870
about Lizzie.

39:37.130 --> 39:39.007
I'll leave you, then.

39:39.090 --> 39:40.591
MOLLY: What's that?

39:41.426 --> 39:42.677
A gift.

39:44.262 --> 39:46.097
-I couldn't possibly.
-Please.

39:47.265 --> 39:48.808
MOLLY: Oh, it's lovely!

39:49.559 --> 39:51.269
It's your home,

39:51.352 --> 39:52.437
but it isn't finished!

39:52.895 --> 39:54.272
No.

39:54.355 --> 39:56.024
I can't, somehow.

39:56.107 --> 39:57.483
My home, my life,

39:58.484 --> 39:59.694
is incomplete

40:00.445 --> 40:01.487
without you.

40:03.197 --> 40:06.826
Just as there's a blank space
in the centre of this picture,

40:06.909 --> 40:08.661
so there's a hole
in my existence,

40:09.620 --> 40:11.205
and only you can
fill it, Molly.

40:12.540 --> 40:13.875
Take the picture,

40:14.959 --> 40:16.127
but I'd rather you took me.

40:17.545 --> 40:19.380
I love you, you see,

40:19.464 --> 40:20.673
and I want us to be together.

40:24.927 --> 40:26.137
What do you want to do, Molly?

40:27.263 --> 40:28.723
Look at life, or live it?

40:33.978 --> 40:35.521
I think you should
finish the picture.

40:37.357 --> 40:38.858
It's really rather good.

40:50.536 --> 40:52.121
Ah, Molly, are you ready?

40:52.205 --> 40:54.415
Don't go away, Golly,
I'll be back in a second.

40:54.874 --> 40:55.917
Archie!

40:59.045 --> 41:00.505
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

41:02.840 --> 41:04.050
Golly.

41:05.927 --> 41:07.679
You're kidding. Come on!

41:07.762 --> 41:10.264
It'll be great. It's more than
we've ever dreamed of.

41:10.348 --> 41:14.102
-Hmm, maybe, but...
-It solves everything, Lex,
everything.

41:16.229 --> 41:17.814
Yeah, I suppose so.

41:19.440 --> 41:21.776
So?

41:21.859 --> 41:26.155
Uh, I said I would support you
no matter what and I will.

41:26.239 --> 41:29.409
Oh, yes! Thank you, Lex!
I knew I could rely on you.

41:29.492 --> 41:31.953
MOLLY:
Children, are you there?

41:32.036 --> 41:35.415
Ah, Lexie, good!
Come on, both of you.
Come, come!

41:36.958 --> 41:38.084
(GASPING)

41:38.167 --> 41:39.377
He's done it!

41:42.255 --> 41:44.674
(CLEARING THROAT)

41:45.258 --> 41:46.426
I...

41:47.844 --> 41:51.764
We, uh, wanted you all
to know straight away.

41:51.848 --> 41:53.182
LIZZIE: What is it?

41:53.266 --> 41:55.768
-I can hardly speak.
-Mummy?

41:55.852 --> 41:57.687
Um, Andrew's asked me
to marry him,

41:57.770 --> 42:00.565
and this morning I accepted
his very kind offer.

42:02.233 --> 42:05.695
LIZZIE: (KISSING)
Mummy, congratulations!

42:05.778 --> 42:07.071
-Great news!
-Thanks, Paul!

42:07.155 --> 42:08.281
I'll get the champagne.

42:11.242 --> 42:12.869
Let me be first
to kiss the bride.

42:16.664 --> 42:18.041
Golly. My true friend.

42:21.002 --> 42:22.712
-Andrew.
-ANDREW: Golly.

42:24.422 --> 42:26.382
-Congratulations.
-Oh, thank you.

42:27.717 --> 42:29.052
DUNCAN:
Yeah, about time, my man.

42:29.886 --> 42:31.262
You naughty boy.

42:33.264 --> 42:36.517
-Congratulations, Andrew.
-Thank you, Archie.
I'm a happy man.

42:37.560 --> 42:38.603
Mother.

42:40.688 --> 42:42.106
-(WHISPERING) Champagne!
-Yes.

42:42.982 --> 42:44.108
MOLLY: Thank you.

42:48.613 --> 42:49.697
I'm okay.

42:50.823 --> 42:52.283
I'm fine.

42:52.367 --> 42:53.659
I'm okay.

43:00.792 --> 43:02.877
We better tell them
your news then.

43:18.935 --> 43:20.770
-There you go.
-Thank you very much.

43:20.853 --> 43:24.148
ARCHIE: (CLEARING THROAT)
On, uh... On occasions
like these,

43:24.232 --> 43:27.235
there's, there's a gesture,
there's a form of words.

43:27.318 --> 43:30.029
We raise our glasses
to the happy couple.

43:30.113 --> 43:33.074
But there's more
than just form here.

43:34.784 --> 43:37.161
Mother, Andrew,

43:38.538 --> 43:40.123
we wish you joy

43:40.206 --> 43:42.291
from the bottom
of our hearts. Joy.

43:42.375 --> 43:43.751
ALL: Joy.

43:43.835 --> 43:45.461
-Thank you all so much.
Thanks a lot.
-Thank you.

43:45.545 --> 43:47.922
-Thank you, darling!
-Congratulations.

43:48.006 --> 43:50.383
-Congratulations, Molly.
-Thank you, Paul.

43:52.844 --> 43:55.722
And, uh, since this
is a morning for news,

43:55.805 --> 43:58.057
I have a little piece
of my own.

43:59.225 --> 44:00.935
Lizzie is planning
an expedition

44:01.019 --> 44:04.814
to climb a very special
mountain in Nepal.

44:04.897 --> 44:07.316
A mountain that our father
climbed many years ago,

44:08.317 --> 44:09.694
and she asked me
to go with her.

44:11.696 --> 44:14.032
Lizzie, I'd love to.

44:15.742 --> 44:16.909
Archie!

44:16.993 --> 44:20.705
That is wonderful!
For both of you.

44:20.788 --> 44:24.459
-ARCHIE: And Lexie.
Lexie's coming too.
-Fantastic.

44:24.542 --> 44:27.754
But obviously there's going
to need to be a few changes
while we're away.

44:29.630 --> 44:30.673
Paul,

44:31.424 --> 44:32.425
you must stay

44:33.217 --> 44:34.469
and manage the place.

44:35.928 --> 44:36.971
Of course.

44:38.056 --> 44:39.098
Thank you, Archie.

44:40.516 --> 44:43.436
And I think we're gonna need
both Duncan and Jessica

44:43.519 --> 44:46.939
-to keep the great
outdoors in shape.
-Oh, what? Thank you so much.

44:47.023 --> 44:48.816
-Oh, that's great.
-Thank you so much!

44:48.900 --> 44:51.277
JESS: Thanks, Archie
DUNCAN: Excellent, thanks very
much, boss.

44:51.361 --> 44:52.653
Knew we could rely on you.

44:57.033 --> 44:59.285
-You all right, Golly?
-I'm fine, son,

44:59.369 --> 45:01.204
but I think you should
go and see to Lexie.

45:06.876 --> 45:08.044
MOLLY: Well said!

45:10.421 --> 45:13.257
A marvel. Everyone's problem
solved in one fell swoop.

45:30.358 --> 45:32.694
(SIGHING)

45:32.777 --> 45:34.904
Got to make the most
of this view before we leave.

45:36.864 --> 45:39.575
-I'm not coming with you.
-What?

45:39.659 --> 45:41.994
Look, this is for you
and Lizzie.

45:42.078 --> 45:43.496
The two of you should go
on your own.

45:43.579 --> 45:46.290
-Come on, Lex.
-Don't, Arch.
My mind's made up.

45:46.374 --> 45:51.045
I can stay here
and look after the place
while you're away.

45:51.129 --> 45:53.089
-Are you angry with me?
-No.

45:55.049 --> 45:57.010
But this whole thing,

45:57.093 --> 46:00.013
it's not just about going
to the Himalayas
for a few months, is it?

46:03.016 --> 46:04.642
You don't want to live here
any more, do you?

46:05.727 --> 46:07.103
Of course I do!

46:07.186 --> 46:09.939
This is my home, my life.

46:14.694 --> 46:15.820
(SIGHING) Okay.

46:17.363 --> 46:18.698
I was going to talk to you
about this.

46:22.660 --> 46:26.164
I can't help thinking that
I've done all I can do here.

46:29.500 --> 46:32.503
And I can't push
my brother out,
I just can't.

46:32.587 --> 46:34.130
I don't understand.

46:34.213 --> 46:36.758
It'll never work
with me and him together.

46:38.468 --> 46:40.845
You and me,
we can build a life
somewhere else,

46:40.928 --> 46:42.513
but I'm just
not sure about Paul.

46:42.597 --> 46:44.849
Yeah, but you're the laird!

46:44.932 --> 46:48.019
That's what your father
always wanted.

46:48.102 --> 46:50.480
Why d'you feel
like you owe Paul so much?

46:52.648 --> 46:53.900
Come on. Tell me.

46:55.526 --> 46:57.487
Sit here and tell me.

47:06.454 --> 47:07.622
(EXHALING)

47:10.750 --> 47:12.460
I...

47:12.543 --> 47:14.128
I was never meant to be here.

47:16.589 --> 47:18.716
It only happened
because I killed Jamie.

47:18.800 --> 47:20.718
Ah, you didn't kill him.
It was an accident.

47:20.802 --> 47:24.305
That's the way
I've always felt it inside.

47:24.389 --> 47:26.474
And Father, too,
that's what he really thought.

47:28.351 --> 47:33.064
So I can't send
his other son away.
I just can't.

47:33.147 --> 47:37.026
This way, if we do this thing
that I'm talking about,
it takes care of everything.

47:38.027 --> 47:40.488
It's like a gift to Paul,

47:40.571 --> 47:43.366
to Lizzie, to Father,
to everyone.

47:43.449 --> 47:46.619
No more obligations,
no more guilt. I'm clear.

47:51.457 --> 47:52.667
Do you understand?

47:56.671 --> 47:57.755
When we come back...

47:58.798 --> 48:00.717
When... When I come back,

48:02.093 --> 48:04.887
we can take a little bit
of Glenbogle with us.

48:04.971 --> 48:07.598
Start another life
somewhere else, just as sweet.

48:09.183 --> 48:10.268
(SIGHING)

48:12.020 --> 48:14.355
-I'm not sure
if I believe that.
-Why not?

48:18.443 --> 48:19.944
You are angry with me.

48:23.656 --> 48:24.907
I'm proud of you.

48:27.035 --> 48:28.870
I'm proud of what you're doing

48:28.953 --> 48:32.165
for Paul and Lizzie and Duncan
and everyone.

48:33.666 --> 48:35.043
It's wonderful.

48:39.505 --> 48:42.216
But I can't help feeling that

48:42.300 --> 48:44.427
the happiness that
you're making for them

48:46.346 --> 48:48.264
is being bought
at the expense of ours.

48:49.057 --> 48:50.099
But...

48:50.183 --> 48:52.060
I'm sorry,
but that's how I feel.

49:13.289 --> 49:14.290
(ANDREW WHISTLING)

49:18.419 --> 49:19.754
Good evening, Golly!

49:22.048 --> 49:23.174
How can I help you?

49:24.759 --> 49:26.219
Molly.

49:26.302 --> 49:28.304
All's fair in love and war,
Golly, even you know that.

49:28.388 --> 49:30.598
Please, Andrew,
spare me your platitudes.

49:32.850 --> 49:34.352
I've come here
to give you notice.

49:36.354 --> 49:38.356
If you hurt that good woman
in any way,

49:40.900 --> 49:41.984
then you'll answer to me.

49:44.195 --> 49:45.196
Understood?

50:11.431 --> 50:14.642
-I think I'm going to cry.
-Let's do this quickly,
shall we?

50:18.688 --> 50:20.314
MOLLY: Bye, darling boy!

50:22.108 --> 50:24.318
-Be happy, Mother.
-Oh, I'll try.

50:26.279 --> 50:27.780
Bye, Lex.

50:27.864 --> 50:29.490
PAUL: Thanks for everything,
brother.

50:29.574 --> 50:31.325
LEXIE: Come and give Mummy
a great big hug!

50:31.409 --> 50:33.369
Hey, come home soon.

50:33.453 --> 50:35.788
-You take care of them
all, yeah?
-Course.

50:37.290 --> 50:39.208
MOLLY: Archie's doing
such a great thing.

50:40.209 --> 50:41.419
Make the most of it.

50:41.502 --> 50:43.087
LIZZIE: We'll be back
for the wedding.

50:43.921 --> 50:45.590
Whee!

50:45.673 --> 50:46.799
I'm proud of you, son.

50:58.186 --> 50:59.771
Bye, Archie. Good luck.

51:01.022 --> 51:02.106
All aboard.

51:04.192 --> 51:06.444
I hope you've packed
your long johns.

51:06.527 --> 51:08.029
I hear it's a bit nippy
in the Himalayas.

51:10.198 --> 51:11.282
Sorry.

51:12.825 --> 51:15.161
-Not much of a joke.
-I love you.

51:27.757 --> 51:28.925
My man.

51:32.470 --> 51:33.513
Haste ye back!

51:57.286 --> 51:58.371
JESS: Take care!

51:59.163 --> 52:00.164
DUNCAN: See ya!

52:02.417 --> 52:03.793
-Let's go.
-MAN: Right.

52:05.503 --> 52:06.546
Bye!

52:07.630 --> 52:08.715
JESS: See you!

Bye!

52:27.775 --> 52:29.944
(SOBBING) Bye.

52:48.004 --> 52:49.047
What's up?

52:50.882 --> 52:52.383
Have you been deserted, too?

53:05.646 --> 53:06.689
You okay?

53:11.778 --> 53:13.946
Lex, I just wanted
to say I'm, uh...

53:14.030 --> 53:15.573
I'm really looking forward
to working with you.

53:18.159 --> 53:19.827
No, Paul.

53:19.911 --> 53:21.829
I think you'll find
you're working for me.
