WEBVTT

00:03.351 --> 00:04.917
SO, LUKE GOT US
A BARRACKS APARTMENT

00:04.917 --> 00:06.310
THAT IS 2 DOORS AWAY
FROM THE INFIRMARY.

00:06.310 --> 00:07.659
SEE, RIGHT THERE.

00:07.659 --> 00:09.705
AND I HAVE A LINE
ON THE DAYCARE SITUATION

00:09.705 --> 00:11.620
ON THE BASE, WHICH REALLY
WON'T BE A SITUATION

00:11.620 --> 00:13.187
TILL I GET A JOB ANYWAY.

00:13.187 --> 00:17.234
SO I FIGURE
ONE MONTH TO SETTLE IN,

00:17.234 --> 00:20.498
AND THEN WE'LL FLY HER BACK
FOR A MONTH WITH YOU.

00:20.498 --> 00:21.847
DAPHNE--

00:21.847 --> 00:23.762
NOW, THIS IS
RIGHT WHEN THE MIDWEST
FURNITURE SHOW ENDS,

00:23.762 --> 00:25.416
WHICH WILL BE PERFECT,
BECAUSE THEN YOU'LL
REALLY HAVE TIME

00:25.416 --> 00:26.635
TO ACTUALLY
HANG OUT WITH HER.

00:26.635 --> 00:29.725
SO IT JUST
WORKS OUT PERFECTLY,
DON'T YOU THINK?

00:29.725 --> 00:32.771
WELL, YOU'VE PRETTY MUCH
COVERED EVERYTHING, I GUESS.

00:32.771 --> 00:33.990
I KNOW,
PLANNING FOR A BABY,

00:33.990 --> 00:35.644
IT'S LIKE WAGING
A WAR OR SOMETHING.

00:35.644 --> 00:37.733
DOESN'T MAKE SENSE,
THOUGH.

00:37.733 --> 00:39.735
WHAT? DOESN'T--

00:39.735 --> 00:41.519
NO, DAPH, IT DOESN'T.

00:41.519 --> 00:43.217
I MEAN, I'VE BEEN
THINKING ABOUT THIS
A LOT, TOO.

00:43.217 --> 00:45.175
AND...

00:45.175 --> 00:46.133
I MEAN, IT'S GREAT
THAT YOU WANT HER WITH YOU.

00:46.133 --> 00:47.438
IT IS.

00:47.438 --> 00:49.658
BUT YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOUR LIFE
WILL BE LIKE YET.

00:49.658 --> 00:51.007
I MEAN,
JUST THE DIANA STUFF--

00:51.007 --> 00:52.835
YOU DON'T HAVE
A PEDIATRICIAN YET,

00:52.835 --> 00:54.184
YOU DON'T HAVE
HER ROOM SET UP,

00:54.184 --> 00:56.012
YOU DON'T KNOW PEOPLE
WITH KIDS HER AGE
TO PLAY WITH.

00:56.012 --> 00:58.275
PLUS THERE'S ALSO--

00:58.275 --> 01:03.106
I MEAN, LET'S FACE IT,
YOU'RE NOT MARRIED TO LUKE.

01:03.106 --> 01:05.500
YOU'VE ONLY
BEEN LIVING TOGETHER
FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS.

01:05.500 --> 01:06.849
I MEAN, WHAT IF
SOMETHING GOES WRONG?

01:06.849 --> 01:08.372
I'M NOT SAYING
THAT IT WILL, BUT--

01:08.372 --> 01:10.766
CHARLIE, I REALLY
DON'T THINK THAT'S
GOING TO BE A PROBLEM.

01:10.766 --> 01:12.985
I JUST THINK
IT MAKES MUCH MORE SENSE

01:12.985 --> 01:14.683
FOR YOU GUYS TO GET
EVERYTHING SMOOTHED OUT

01:14.683 --> 01:16.641
BEFORE SHE COMES DOWN
FOR A VISIT.

01:16.641 --> 01:18.817
A VISIT?

01:18.817 --> 01:20.689
AND BESIDES, IT'LL BE
A LOT EASIER TO GET SET UP

01:20.689 --> 01:23.344
WITHOUT HAVING TO CHASE
HER AROUND ALL THE TIME.

01:23.344 --> 01:25.868
AND THEN WE'LL
COME DOWN AND SEE YOU.

01:25.868 --> 01:27.522
ME AND KIRSTEN
AND DIANA,

01:27.522 --> 01:29.828
WE'LL ALL
COME DOWN AND SEE YOU.

01:29.828 --> 01:31.961
OK?

01:31.961 --> 01:34.877
WHERE'S
THAT SNACK BAG?

01:34.877 --> 01:36.574
SOMEBODY'S STOMACH'S
GROWLING HERE.

01:36.574 --> 01:37.575
RIGHT HERE.

01:37.575 --> 01:38.707
OH, HERE WE GO.

01:41.362 --> 01:42.928
EVERYTHING OK?

01:44.365 --> 01:46.497

05:29.546 --> 05:30.852
WELL, LET'S SEE, UM,

05:30.852 --> 05:33.768
MY OLD ROOMMATE
JO JO, SHE'S--

NO, FORGET IT.

05:35.596 --> 05:37.075
WHAT?

05:37.075 --> 05:38.686
SHE'S HAVING A PARTY
DOWN ON THE HAIGHT,

05:38.686 --> 05:40.383
AND IT'S NOT
YOUR SCENE

05:40.383 --> 05:42.472
AND IT'S NOT MINE
ANYMORE. SO--

05:42.472 --> 05:44.779
WHY NOT?

05:44.779 --> 05:48.522
AT JO JO'S
LAST SOIREE...

05:48.522 --> 05:50.959
SOMEBODY TAPPED
A KEG WITH
A TIRE IRON,

05:50.959 --> 05:52.221
AND BEER
WENT EVERYWHERE,

05:52.221 --> 05:55.050
AND IT TOOK
2 FIRE MARSHALS

05:55.050 --> 05:57.748
AND 14 COPS
TO BREAK IT UP.

05:57.748 --> 05:58.836
WELL, THAT SOUNDS
LIKE FUN.

05:58.836 --> 06:00.316
UNLESS YOU'RE
NOT INTO IT.

06:00.316 --> 06:04.189
NO, I LOVE WATCHING
JO JO GET BUSTED.
IT'S JUST THAT--

06:04.189 --> 06:07.018
COOL.
WE'RE THERE.

06:07.018 --> 06:08.411
LET'S DO IT.

06:08.411 --> 06:09.412
OK.

06:09.412 --> 06:11.153
OK.

06:18.203 --> 06:21.816
I FEEL LIKE I ATE
A SMALL VILLAGE.

06:21.816 --> 06:24.906
THOSE CHILI CHEESE FRIES
SHOULD BE AGAINST THE LAW.

06:24.906 --> 06:27.778
YEAH, WELL, ELMO'S
ISN'T EXACTLY FAMOUS
FOR ITS SPA CUISINE.

06:27.778 --> 06:29.214

06:29.214 --> 06:30.433
CAN WE PLEASE TALK

06:30.433 --> 06:32.000

06:37.222 --> 06:40.269
I AM WAY BEHIND

06:40.269 --> 06:42.750
SO I SHOULD--
I SHOULD REALLY WRITE.

06:42.750 --> 06:45.579
WHAT?

06:45.579 --> 06:47.581
WHY ARE YOU
SUDDENLY BAILING ON ME?

06:47.581 --> 06:48.886

06:48.886 --> 06:53.630
LOOK, I, UH,
I JUST FEEL WEIRD
BEING THERE.

06:53.630 --> 06:55.893
WHY? THEY INVITED YOU.

06:55.893 --> 06:57.721
NO, I KNOW.

06:57.721 --> 06:59.549
IT'S JUST, UH...

06:59.549 --> 07:00.855
WHAT?

07:00.855 --> 07:02.639
LOOK, THEY'RE

07:02.639 --> 07:06.295
WHAT? A LOUSY COUPLE,
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

07:06.295 --> 07:08.123
THEY'RE A GREAT COUPLE.

07:08.123 --> 07:10.952
ASK JUSTIN. I MEAN,
SHE CHANGED HIS LIFE.

07:10.952 --> 07:12.170
YOU KNOW,
WELL, FROM WHAT I SAW,

07:12.170 --> 07:14.042
THEY DON'T HAVE
A WHOLE LOT IN COMMON.

07:14.042 --> 07:16.610
HOW DO YOU KNOW?

07:16.610 --> 07:18.525
SHE LEADS HIM
AROUND BY THE NOSE.

07:18.525 --> 07:20.222
I MEAN,
THEY DON'T CLICK.

07:20.222 --> 07:22.267
THEY DON'T RIFF OFF
OF EACH OTHER.

07:22.267 --> 07:23.312
RIFF OFF OF EACH OTHER?

07:23.312 --> 07:24.835
WHO RIFFS OFF
OF EACH OTHER?

07:24.835 --> 07:27.925
WELL...
JUSTIN AND YOU.

07:29.884 --> 07:32.016
WHAT?
JUSTIN AND WHAT?

07:32.016 --> 07:33.017
WHY, YOU KIDDING?

07:33.017 --> 07:34.976
IF YOU VIDEOTAPED
OUR EVENING TONIGHT

07:34.976 --> 07:38.022
AND ASKED PEOPLE
TO PICK OUT
THE LOVING COUPLE,

07:38.022 --> 07:39.807
YOU AND JUSTIN
WOULD WIN,

07:39.807 --> 07:40.895
HANDS DOWN.

07:42.810 --> 07:44.507
YEAH, WELL, YOU KNOW,
THAT'S JUST 'CAUSE...

07:44.507 --> 07:48.468
JUSTIN AND I
HAVE KNOWN EACH OTHER
FOR, LIKE, FOREVER.

07:48.468 --> 07:50.644
AND WE HAVE HISTORY.

07:50.644 --> 07:53.603
YEAH,
AND PRESENT AND--

07:53.603 --> 07:54.735
LISTEN, FORGET IT, OK?

07:54.735 --> 07:56.824
WHO CARES?

07:56.824 --> 07:58.782
JUSTIN AND LAURA
ARE HAVING A PARTY TOMORROW

07:58.782 --> 08:00.828
BECAUSE THEY ARE ENGAGED.

08:00.828 --> 08:01.872
IT'S A HAPPY OCCASION,

08:01.872 --> 08:03.178
AND I'M GOING,
AND YOU SAID YOU WOULD TOO,

08:03.178 --> 08:05.310
SO WE'RE GOING
TOGETHER, OK?

08:05.310 --> 08:06.877
OK?

08:26.941 --> 08:28.899
THERE YOU ARE!

08:28.899 --> 08:30.466
HI.

08:30.466 --> 08:31.598
ARE YOU HAVING
A GOOD TIME?

08:31.598 --> 08:32.686
DEFINITELY.

08:32.686 --> 08:35.036
I WAS DANCING WITH
SOME CRAZY BALD GIRL.

08:35.036 --> 08:36.516
AT LEAST I THINK
IT WAS A GIRL.

08:40.607 --> 08:41.999
HEY, WHAT'S THAT TASTE?

08:41.999 --> 08:43.392
COME ON, LET'S DANCE.

08:43.392 --> 08:45.916
WAIT, IS THAT--
IS THAT BEER?

08:45.916 --> 08:48.571
NO.

08:48.571 --> 08:51.226
WELL, OH, NO, IT'S
JUST NON-ALCOHOLIC.

08:51.226 --> 08:54.359
AT JO JO'S?
NO WAY.

08:54.359 --> 08:56.753
OK, HEY, WAIT.

08:56.753 --> 09:00.061
LISTEN,
DON'T FREAK OUT
ON ME HERE, OK?

09:00.061 --> 09:01.192
BUT I HAD A BEER.

09:01.192 --> 09:03.630
YOU WERE DRINKING?

09:03.630 --> 09:05.066

I SHOULD CALL IT OFF.

18:56.047 --> 18:57.266

18:57.266 --> 18:58.441
THAT'S WHAT THAT MEANS.

18:58.441 --> 19:01.444
TO SLOW IT DOWN MEANS
TO NOT GET MARRIED YET.

WANT THAT TO HAPPEN.

IT DOESN'T KILL ME
THAT I CAN'T HAVE IT, TOO.

27:22.466 --> 27:25.861

REALLY GOOD, JULIA.

27:25.861 --> 27:26.862

CREEPS ME OUT,

28:10.079 --> 28:11.167

28:11.167 --> 28:14.518
BECAUSE IT'S THE KIND
OF STUFF I CAN'T DO--

28:14.518 --> 28:16.390
MESSY AND EMOTIONAL.

28:16.390 --> 28:18.174
IT FEELS LIKE
I CAN'T CONTROL IT.

28:18.174 --> 28:19.828
BUT YOU?
YOU DON'T CARE.

28:19.828 --> 28:22.265

THINK SO.

28:53.557 --> 28:56.256
IS SO OBVIOUSLY
YOU AND JUSTIN,

28:56.256 --> 28:58.432
AND THAT IS ALL THAT IS
ON YOUR MIND HERE.

28:58.432 --> 28:59.738
WHAT? WHAT ARE YOU--

28:59.738 --> 29:02.784
NO. THE SIMPLE FACT
IS THAT YOU ARE
TRYING TO PROVE

29:02.784 --> 29:04.220
YOU'RE NOT STILL
ATTRACTED TO HIM

29:04.220 --> 29:06.832
BECAUSE YOU DON'T
WANNA ADMIT THAT
YOU MIGHT ACTUALLY HAVE

29:06.832 --> 29:08.964
SOME SELFISH REASONS
FOR WANTING
TO BREAK THEM UP.

29:08.964 --> 29:11.750
BUT GUESS WHAT?
WHO CARES?

29:11.750 --> 29:13.490
THEY PROBABLY
SHOULD BREAK UP.

29:13.490 --> 29:14.535
ADAM, WAIT.

29:14.535 --> 29:17.320
NO. YOU NEED TO DEAL
WITH THIS, JULIA.

29:17.320 --> 29:18.539
YOU NEED
TO TALK TO JUSTIN

29:18.539 --> 29:20.802
BECAUSE I...

29:20.802 --> 29:22.717
I WOULD LOVE
TO KISS YOU.

29:22.717 --> 29:23.936
YOU KNOW THAT.

29:23.936 --> 29:24.937
ADAM--

29:24.937 --> 29:27.330
BUT WHEN
AND IF I EVER DO,

29:27.330 --> 29:29.811
I DON'T WANNA WONDER
WHEN YOU CLOSE YOUR EYES

29:29.811 --> 29:31.770
IF YOU'RE
THINKING OF HIM.

29:56.359 --> 29:57.360
HEY.

29:57.360 --> 29:58.492
HEY.

30:00.711 --> 30:03.497
WHAT ARE YOU
THINKING ABOUT?

30:05.716 --> 30:07.806
OH. STUPID QUESTION.

30:09.938 --> 30:11.592
I'M JUST...

30:12.854 --> 30:15.552
THERE'S SO MANY SIDES
TO THIS.

30:15.552 --> 30:18.251
I WANNA BE FAIR, BUT...

30:18.251 --> 30:20.906
I AM NOT GONNA LOSE
MY DAUGHTER.

30:20.906 --> 30:23.082
YOU SAID IT YOURSELF.

30:23.082 --> 30:24.997
LEGALLY, I DON'T HAVE
MUCH OF A LEG
TO STAND ON.

30:24.997 --> 30:27.695
I MEAN, WHAT IF SHE
JUST CHANGES HER MIND

30:27.695 --> 30:31.133
AND, YOU KNOW,
TAKES HER?

30:31.133 --> 30:33.483
CHARLIE, SHE'S
NOT GONNA DO THAT.

30:33.483 --> 30:36.399
THAT'S NOT WHO SHE IS.

30:36.399 --> 30:38.401
I KNOW.

30:38.401 --> 30:40.751
AND I HATE THAT
SHE'S THAT UNHAPPY,

30:40.751 --> 30:42.318
BUT I MEAN,
BOTTOM LINE,

30:42.318 --> 30:45.539
I HAVE TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT'S BEST FOR DIANA.

30:47.758 --> 30:50.544
MAN, THIS SITUATION
IS JUST SO...

30:53.286 --> 30:56.637
I'M TRYING TO DO
THE RIGHT THING HERE,
YOU KNOW?

30:56.637 --> 30:57.856
I KNOW.

31:01.163 --> 31:04.384
I REALLY DON'T KNOW
WHAT I'M SUPPOSED TO DO.

31:15.221 --> 31:16.439
HEY.

31:16.439 --> 31:17.832
BAILEY.

31:17.832 --> 31:20.269
THIS JUST KEEPS
HAPPENING TO US, HUH?

31:20.269 --> 31:23.359
JUST WHEN YOU START
TO THINK THAT I MIGHT
NOT BE A LOSER--

31:23.359 --> 31:25.361
LOOK, I DON'T
WANNA BE RUDE--

31:25.361 --> 31:28.147
OK, I KNOW THAT LOOKED BAD.
THAT LOOKED HORRIBLE.

31:28.147 --> 31:29.191
I REALLY--

31:29.191 --> 31:31.193
I'D REALLY RATHER
YOU DIDN'T.

31:31.193 --> 31:37.112
LISTEN, I WAS TRYING
TO HELP OUT THIS OTHER
PERSON, OK, AND...

31:37.112 --> 31:40.376
WHICH IS GETTING TO BE
A REALLY BAD HABIT WITH ME,

31:40.376 --> 31:42.378
TRYING TO FIX EVERYTHING,

31:42.378 --> 31:45.686
WHEN THE TRUTH IS THAT I KNOW
THERE'S SOME THINGS THAT
YOU REALLY JUST CAN'T FIX.

31:45.686 --> 31:47.035
I WANT YOU TO LEAVE.

31:47.035 --> 31:48.210
HOLLY, WAIT.
JUST LET ME--
NO!

31:48.210 --> 31:49.385
I'M NOT INTERESTED.

31:49.385 --> 31:51.866
SEE, NOW, THAT'S NOT TRUE.
I KNOW THAT ISN'T TRUE.

31:51.866 --> 31:53.650
I TOLD YOU THAT I HOPE
THAT I'D BE AROUND

31:53.650 --> 31:55.304
WHEN YOU GOT THINGS
SORTED OUT,

31:55.304 --> 31:57.567
BUT AFTER WHAT I SAW
AT THE HOSPITAL
LAST NIGHT,

31:57.567 --> 31:58.960
IT'S JUST OBVIOUSLY
NOT THE CASE, IS IT?

31:58.960 --> 32:01.702
I DON'T KNOW!
WHAT IS THAT ANYWAY,
"SORTED OUT"?

32:01.702 --> 32:03.182
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

32:03.182 --> 32:06.185
WHEN DOES A PERSON HAVE
ALL OF THEIR PROBLEMS
ALL FIGURED OUT?

32:06.185 --> 32:07.186
NEVER, EVER!

32:07.186 --> 32:09.014
YOU'RE ACTUALLY
BEGINNING TO SCARE ME.

32:11.277 --> 32:13.409
SEE, YOU KNOW WHAT
YOUR PROBLEM IS, HOLLY?

32:13.409 --> 32:14.454
YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS?

32:14.454 --> 32:15.977
IT'S THE WAY YOU LOOK DOWN
AT EVERYTHING

32:15.977 --> 32:17.805
THAT YOU DON'T THINK
IS ABSOLUTELY PERFECT.

32:17.805 --> 32:20.068
YOU ACTUALLY REALLY THINK
YOU'RE EVER GONNA FIND THAT?

32:20.068 --> 32:21.374
DO YOU?

32:21.374 --> 32:23.463
SOMEBODY WHO'S GOT
ALL THEIR PROBLEMS
ALL SORTED OUT?

32:23.463 --> 32:24.681
THAT'S A FANTASY.

32:24.681 --> 32:26.379
I WANT YOU
TO LEAVE NOW.
YOU KNOW
WHAT'S REAL?

32:26.379 --> 32:28.424
THIS IS WHAT'S REAL, HOLLY.
PEOPLE WHO HAVE PROBLEMS.

32:28.424 --> 32:30.774
GET OUT OF MY HOUSE NOW.

32:46.660 --> 32:47.661
HEY.

32:47.661 --> 32:48.662
HEY.

32:48.662 --> 32:50.359
LISTEN, IS SHE--

32:50.359 --> 32:52.666
GO ON IN.

33:05.984 --> 33:07.376
YOU KNOW,
IT'S WEIRD IN A WAY.

33:07.376 --> 33:09.988
I, UH...

33:09.988 --> 33:13.252
I WANTED IT THE MOST,
AND I WAS THE LAST ONE
TO SEE IT.

33:17.343 --> 33:19.693
YOU'RE REALLY HER MOM.

33:22.565 --> 33:23.958
CHARLIE, WHAT ARE YOU--

33:23.958 --> 33:27.309
THERE ARE SOME THINGS
THAT I DON'T WANT HER
TO MISS HERE.

33:27.309 --> 33:31.400
LIKE HER PEDIATRICIAN'S
APPOINTMENT IN MARCH.

33:31.400 --> 33:33.141
THAT'S--THAT'S 4 WEEKS.

33:33.141 --> 33:35.100
AND, UH...

33:35.100 --> 33:37.145
I KNOW THIS
IS GONNA SOUND SILLY,

33:37.145 --> 33:39.321
BUT THERE'S SOME
BIRTHDAYS COMIN' UP,
CLAUD'S AND OWEN'S,

33:39.321 --> 33:42.585
AND, UH...
DIANA JUST LOVES
THAT STUFF, SO--

33:42.585 --> 33:45.632
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

33:45.632 --> 33:50.028
I WANT YOU
TO TAKE HER, DAPH.

33:50.028 --> 33:54.858
I WANT YOU TO GO
TO TEXAS WITH LUKE,
AND, UH...

33:54.858 --> 33:57.209
TAKE OUR GIRL.

33:58.906 --> 34:00.908
HA HA.

34:00.908 --> 34:02.866
CHARLIE. HA HA.

34:05.565 --> 34:08.046
UH, KIRSTEN'S
DOWNSTAIRS IN THE TRUCK
WITH HER RIGHT NOW.

34:08.046 --> 34:09.525
WE PACKED UP
ALL OF HER STUFF.

34:09.525 --> 34:12.833
YOU WHAT?
YOU DID WHAT?

34:12.833 --> 34:15.053
YEAH, WE'LL HAVE
TO FIGURE OUT A SYSTEM
THAT'S BEST FOR HER.

34:15.053 --> 34:20.145
WE'LL...TRADE MONTHS OR
SEASONS OR SOMETHIN'...

34:20.145 --> 34:24.105
BUT WE NEED TO PLAN.
I NEED TO KNOW WHEN
SHE'S GONNA BE HERE.

34:24.105 --> 34:27.239
YEAH, I CAN'T
BELIEVE THAT THIS IS--

34:27.239 --> 34:28.849
IT JUST MAKES
MORE SENSE FOR YOU
TO TAKE HER FIRST.

34:28.849 --> 34:32.548
ME AND KIRSTEN WILL
BE...A LOT LESS BUSY...

34:32.548 --> 34:36.074
IN MARCH, AND...

34:36.074 --> 34:40.078
SHE'LL JUST BE A LOT
HAPPIER WITH A FULL-TIME
PARENT ANYWAY.

34:40.078 --> 34:41.427
YEAH.

34:41.427 --> 34:44.430
I--I MARKED DOWN SOME
DATES ON THE CALENDAR.

34:44.430 --> 34:47.128
NOTHING'S IN STONE,
BUT, YOU KNOW,

34:47.128 --> 34:48.608
THE SOONER WE GET
ALL THAT SETTLED...

34:49.522 --> 34:52.090
I UNDERSTAND.

34:53.003 --> 34:55.005
GOOD.

35:05.799 --> 35:06.800
HEY.

35:06.800 --> 35:08.628
HEY.

35:08.628 --> 35:10.369
THANKS FOR
LETTING ME COME.

35:10.369 --> 35:12.371
YOU WANT SOMETHING
TO DRINK?

35:12.371 --> 35:14.199
COFFEE OR--

35:14.199 --> 35:16.462
I LIED TO YOU, JUSTIN.

35:17.376 --> 35:18.899
YOU WHAT?

35:18.899 --> 35:21.815
I'M JEALOUS
OF YOU AND LAURA.

35:21.815 --> 35:24.339
AND THEN I TRIED
TO PRETEND THAT I WASN'T,

35:24.339 --> 35:29.388
BUT THAT'S WHAT IT IS.
I'M JEALOUS.

35:32.086 --> 35:33.653
WELL, LISTEN--

35:33.653 --> 35:37.091
SEE, UM,
YOU'RE MY FRIEND.

35:37.091 --> 35:39.572
YOU ARE, BUT YOU'RE
ALSO, IN SO MANY WAYS,

35:39.572 --> 35:44.011
YOU'RE...SORT OF MY FIRST.

35:44.011 --> 35:47.014
SO SEEING YOU DO THIS,
COMMITTING YOURSELF
TO THIS OTHER PERSON,

35:47.014 --> 35:51.758
IT'S--IT'S WEIRD.

35:51.758 --> 35:53.760
I MEAN, HOW AM I
SUPPOSED TO FEEL?

35:53.760 --> 35:56.589
AM I SUPPOSED TO FEEL HOPEFUL
BECAUSE YOU MET SOMEONE,

35:56.589 --> 35:57.677
SO MAYBE I WILL, TOO?

35:57.677 --> 35:59.287
OR AM I SUPPOSED
TO FEEL SAD

35:59.287 --> 36:02.464
BECAUSE I'M LOSING
ONE OF THE FEW PEOPLE
WHO EVER MADE SENSE FOR ME?

36:06.033 --> 36:09.863
I GET IT.

36:09.863 --> 36:12.170
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO SAY THAT. IF YOU'RE
ANGRY WITH ME, THEN--

36:12.170 --> 36:16.739
WHY DO YOU THINK
I ASKED YOU IF
I OUGHT TO SLOW DOWN?

36:16.739 --> 36:22.223
IT'S BECAUSE I'M AFRAID
THAT THERE MIGHT BE
SOMEBODY ELSE

36:22.223 --> 36:26.314
THAT I OUGHT TO BE WITH.

36:26.314 --> 36:29.709
AND YOU KNOW,
IF I WERE TO MAKE A LIST
OF WHO THAT MIGHT BE...

36:31.014 --> 36:32.886
WHO DO YOU THINK'S
NUMBER ONE?

36:37.064 --> 36:39.327
WOW. HEH.

36:42.591 --> 36:45.594
SO, UM...

36:45.594 --> 36:47.161
WHAT DO WE DO NOW?

36:50.599 --> 36:52.862
I'M ENGAGED, JULIA.

36:54.212 --> 36:57.563
RIGHT. I--I KNOW.
UM...RIGHT.

36:57.563 --> 37:00.653
I MEAN,
I'M NOT MARRIED...

37:00.653 --> 37:04.526
BUT I'M ENGAGED.

37:07.268 --> 37:12.491
SO, I'M GONNA GO BACK
TO NEW HAVEN WITH LAURA,

37:12.491 --> 37:15.233
AND THEN, UM...

37:17.104 --> 37:18.627
WHAT?

37:19.672 --> 37:22.109
WE'LL SEE.

37:35.122 --> 37:38.517
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO EXPLAIN
HOW LONG A MONTH IS,

37:38.517 --> 37:42.608
BUT...IT'S NOT THAT LONG.

37:42.608 --> 37:45.828
YOU'LL GO NIGHT-NIGHT,
AND YOU'LL WAKE UP,

37:45.828 --> 37:47.700
AND YOU'LL DO THAT
AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN,

37:47.700 --> 37:50.877
AND THEN--AND THEN
DADDY WILL BE THERE.

37:50.877 --> 37:55.273
OK? KIRSTEN AND
I WILL BE THERE, AND
WE'LL BE TOGETHER AGAIN.

37:55.273 --> 37:59.102
AND UNTIL THEN,
WELL, JUST--

37:59.102 --> 38:05.544
WELL, REMEMBER
THAT I LOVE YOU. OK?

38:05.544 --> 38:07.459
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH...

38:07.459 --> 38:12.202
AND WE'LL TALK ON
THE PHONE EVERY DAY. OK?

38:13.029 --> 38:15.031
ALL RIGHT?

38:15.031 --> 38:18.034
I'LL SEE YOU REAL SOON.

38:22.169 --> 38:24.171
I LOVE YOU.

38:33.354 --> 38:35.878
OK, SO...

38:35.878 --> 38:38.838
I WILL CALL YOU AS SOON
AS WE CHECK IN TONIGHT,

38:38.838 --> 38:41.275
AND AS SOON AS
WE HAVE A PHONE NUMBER--

38:41.275 --> 38:45.323
I KNOW. I KNOW.
I KNOW. IT'S OK.

38:54.723 --> 38:56.116
YOU'D BETTER GET GOIN'.

38:56.116 --> 38:57.987
YOU GOTTA MAKE
NEVADA TODAY, SO...

38:57.987 --> 38:59.293
OK.

39:08.389 --> 39:09.651

WHAT DO YOU WANT?

40:27.773 --> 40:29.949
I DON'T KNOW.
JUST...

40:29.949 --> 40:31.559
YOUR JEEP WAS PARKED
KINDA FUNNY,

40:31.559 --> 40:32.691
AND YOUR KEYS WERE
JUST THROWN ON THE RUG,

40:32.691 --> 40:34.257
SO I JUST WANTED
TO MAKE SURE--

40:34.257 --> 40:35.650
CLAUD, COULD YOU NOT
BE HERE RIGHT NOW?

40:35.650 --> 40:38.087
PLEASE, I'M TIRED.
I NEED TO REST.

40:38.087 --> 40:40.655
WHAT'S GOIN' ON?
YOU SEEM KINDA--

40:40.655 --> 40:43.789

TO FLOOR]

40:47.096 --> 40:49.229

40:50.404 --> 40:51.927

HAVE YOU
BEEN DRINKING?

40:56.802 --> 40:59.500

40:59.500 --> 41:00.806
WELL, I DID.

41:00.806 --> 41:02.547
OH, MY GOD, BAILEY.

SOME BIG EMERGENCY,

41:06.333 --> 41:08.335
YOU GUYS, OK?
I HAD A BAD DAY,

41:08.335 --> 41:10.076
SO I HAD A COUPLE
OF DRINKS.

41:10.076 --> 41:12.557
THAT'S IT. I'M NOT
GONNA BURST INTO FLAMES.

41:12.557 --> 41:14.907
BAILEY, WHAT
HAPPENED TO YOU?
HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?

41:14.907 --> 41:16.909
HEH.

41:16.909 --> 41:19.912
HEH...HA.

41:19.912 --> 41:21.304

41:21.304 --> 41:23.393
WELL, LET'S SEE...

LET'S SEE, WE HAD

THAT I PULL OVER NOW,

AND I GET OUT, AND I STRETCH
MY LEGS FOR AWHILE.
