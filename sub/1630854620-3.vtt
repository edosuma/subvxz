WEBVTT

00:03.273 --> 00:06.312
- I love you.
- And I love you.

00:06.312 --> 00:08.784
Do you smell something?

00:11.690 --> 00:12.893
both: Cherry?

00:12.893 --> 00:14.328
both: No!

00:52.137 --> 00:54.242
I thought
my new dog-walking group

00:54.242 --> 00:55.845
would be a chance for me
to dominate socially.

00:55.845 --> 00:59.519
But the female dogs are so
cliquey and full of themselves

00:59.519 --> 01:02.258
with their long coats
and in-proportion bodies.

01:02.258 --> 01:04.262
I get it, Elsa.
I've been trying to make

01:04.262 --> 01:06.266
friends with the birds
outside Kevin's apartment

01:06.266 --> 01:08.136
to save me from my
soul-crushing loneliness,

01:08.136 --> 01:12.177
but they deserve better.
- Chico, I am so sorry...

01:12.177 --> 01:14.315
you thought it was a good idea
to talk just then.

01:14.415 --> 01:16.654
Elsa, I think
the real problem is your issue

01:16.654 --> 01:19.358
with female animals.
- I do not have an issue

01:19.358 --> 01:21.563
with female animals.
I mean, you and I are

01:21.563 --> 01:23.567
basically best friends.
- Incorrect.

01:23.567 --> 01:27.441
Well, Tabs, Nibs, how many
gals' nights have we spent

01:27.441 --> 01:28.844
braiding each other's fur?
- None.

01:28.945 --> 01:32.217
- We never include you in that.
- Okay, well, Bubbles--

01:32.217 --> 01:34.055
Don't ever talk to me.

01:35.692 --> 01:38.430
Honey, do you think
I need to lose weight?

01:38.430 --> 01:40.434
Is this about those mean dogs
at the beach

01:40.434 --> 01:43.173
calling you a small walrus?
- They actually called me

01:43.173 --> 01:45.277
a "smallrus,"
which is more hurtful,

01:45.277 --> 01:48.283
because it's fun to say.
- Smallrus.

01:48.283 --> 01:51.590
No, it's Jill.
She's getting me a dog walker.

01:51.590 --> 01:54.328
Makes no sense.
Most of this is muscle.

01:54.428 --> 01:56.600
Yep, pillowy, soft,
undulating muscle.

01:56.600 --> 01:58.671
But the exercise might be good
for you.

01:58.671 --> 02:01.309
I don't know.
I think I'm in pretty...

02:01.309 --> 02:02.311
good...

02:02.311 --> 02:04.650
shape.

02:04.650 --> 02:08.524
Uh, hey, can you, um--
can you just slow down?

02:08.524 --> 02:10.762
I think I'm maxed out
speed-wise.

02:10.762 --> 02:13.466
Yeah, everyone, can you
please be considerate?

02:13.466 --> 02:16.907
Because this whale ain't used
to walking on dry land!

02:16.907 --> 02:18.276
Bladow!

02:18.276 --> 02:23.521
Ho-ho, oh yeah, Clark?
Well, could a whale do this?

02:25.625 --> 02:27.629
Are you all right there, laddie?

02:27.629 --> 02:31.302
Whoa, did I die?
Are you an angel?

02:31.302 --> 02:34.910
No, you just
fluffed your ruff a bit.

02:34.910 --> 02:36.479
I'm Ruby.
- I'm Chief.

02:36.479 --> 02:39.251
Um, could you give me
a little nudge?

02:39.251 --> 02:42.625
I'm working with, like,
zero core strength here.

02:42.625 --> 02:44.863
Yeah, heh. Thanks.

02:44.863 --> 02:47.368
I miss my house.

02:47.368 --> 02:49.840
I just wanna get back
to my cozy bed and play

02:49.840 --> 02:53.480
with my cool toys and eat
the pot pies my human leaves

02:53.480 --> 02:55.685
on the counter to thaw
while she's at work.

02:55.685 --> 02:58.456
Oh, I'm sure it's a gas
roamin' around your house

02:58.456 --> 03:00.460
flinky binky
while your human's away.

03:00.460 --> 03:02.932
But this walk doesn't have
to be all bad.

03:02.932 --> 03:04.536
My mam mam used to always say,

03:04.536 --> 03:07.642
"You can't blonter a clover
without dimpin' a little gold.

03:07.642 --> 03:09.880
So dry those eyes
and get ploofin'!"

03:09.880 --> 03:13.386
It's not like I don't want
to ploof, but it's hard

03:13.386 --> 03:15.858
when I'm stuck on this walk
with stupid Clark

03:15.858 --> 03:19.298
and his cool wheels
and his awesome floppy legs.

03:19.298 --> 03:21.335
Oh, help!
I'm getting sucked

03:21.436 --> 03:24.408
into the gravitational pull
of this gas giant!

03:24.408 --> 03:25.545
- Ow!
- Bladow!

03:25.545 --> 03:27.649
Oh, forget about him.

03:27.649 --> 03:29.653
What do you reckon you and me
be friends?

03:29.653 --> 03:32.458
Huh?
I'd reckon that very much.

03:32.458 --> 03:35.798
At least there's one
nice dog on this walk.

03:37.936 --> 03:39.305
<i>Watch out, bitches.</i>

03:39.305 --> 03:41.643
I'm about to friend
your brains out.

03:41.643 --> 03:45.117
Making lifelong female friends
in three, two--

03:45.117 --> 03:46.219
Chief?

03:46.319 --> 03:48.490
Honey didn't tell me you were
gonna be on my walks.

03:48.490 --> 03:50.227
- Hey, uh--?
- Elsa.

03:50.227 --> 03:51.429
- You know each other?
- Um...

03:51.429 --> 03:52.799
Uh, know each other?

03:52.799 --> 03:55.036
I'm only at his house, like,
every day.

03:55.036 --> 03:56.573
Well, isn't that a womper?

03:56.573 --> 03:58.577
Well, I'd love
to stay and chat,

03:58.577 --> 04:02.251
but I have some
heavy-duty bondage to get into.

04:02.251 --> 04:05.023
What up, sluts?
You wanna slow your roll

04:05.023 --> 04:07.294
so E-cig can get up in there?

04:07.294 --> 04:09.498
This content has been flagged
as basic.

04:09.498 --> 04:12.672
- Oh, forget it.
- Oh, don't let those lassies

04:12.672 --> 04:14.609
chap your slapper.
They wouldn't know

04:14.609 --> 04:17.347
a loafy from a zagger
if it bit 'em in the dumper.

04:17.347 --> 04:19.519
Yeah!
I'm not the problem here.

04:19.519 --> 04:22.124
Wait, have you been
on these walks before?

04:22.124 --> 04:23.193
Eh, a few times.

04:23.193 --> 04:24.896
I just moved here
from Echo Park.

04:24.896 --> 04:26.432
Oh, yeah, my human

04:26.432 --> 04:29.238
got tear-gassed
in a swan boat there once.

04:29.238 --> 04:30.708
Why don't you have a leash?

04:30.708 --> 04:32.444
My human doesn't believe
in the power dynamic

04:32.444 --> 04:34.381
they support.
Well, sounds like you know

04:34.381 --> 04:37.321
Chief pretty well.
Are you two...

04:37.321 --> 04:39.492
Oh, God, no.
I mean, I can't say

04:39.492 --> 04:40.427
I've never gotten a vibe,

04:40.528 --> 04:43.099
but he's the mate
of my best friend, Honey.

04:43.099 --> 04:44.903
She worships me.
- His mate?

04:44.903 --> 04:47.642
Yeah.
Look at me crushing

04:47.642 --> 04:51.149
female friendship.
Bladow!

04:55.357 --> 04:57.461
Chico, you made it.

04:57.461 --> 04:59.465
Yeah,
thanks for inviting me over.

04:59.465 --> 05:01.002
Kevin's been gone
longer than usual,

05:01.002 --> 05:03.473
and Hoodie Kevin's giving me
the silent treatment again.

05:03.473 --> 05:05.878
Just tell me what I did.

05:05.878 --> 05:07.615
So it's nice
to not be alone for a while.

05:07.615 --> 05:10.521
Happy to help, but you've
got to be out before dark,

05:10.521 --> 05:13.561
because once the Sun goes down,
I cannot protect you.

05:13.661 --> 05:16.667
- Exciting!
- So that's the gym.

05:16.667 --> 05:18.236
Don't go in there
without a spotter.

05:18.236 --> 05:20.240
One...

05:20.240 --> 05:22.110
It's also
the birthing center.

05:22.110 --> 05:23.747
And this is the dining room.

05:23.747 --> 05:25.417
Do not eat anything
you find in here.

05:25.417 --> 05:26.653
Oh, your human's here.

05:26.653 --> 05:28.289
That's
my human's twin sister.

05:28.389 --> 05:29.759
She died years ago.

05:29.759 --> 05:33.734
You have a lovely home,
ma'am.

05:33.734 --> 05:35.505
And this is the pool.

05:35.505 --> 05:36.974
Let me guess--
don't go in there?

05:36.974 --> 05:39.713
Eh, it depends on how
attached you are to your fur.

05:39.713 --> 05:41.917
Maybe I'll skip the pool.

05:44.421 --> 05:46.425
I'll be so happy
when this walk is over

05:46.425 --> 05:48.697
and I'll have lost
all that weight.

05:48.797 --> 05:52.271
So tell me more about Chief.
What twinks his dink?

05:52.271 --> 05:53.941
Let's see.
Well, he likes eating,

05:53.941 --> 05:56.012
obviously.
Um, big napper.

05:56.012 --> 05:58.383
He hates squirrels,
but loves chasing them.

05:58.383 --> 06:00.453
Ooh, complex.

06:00.555 --> 06:04.261
And what is Honey like?
- Well, she's a therapist,

06:04.261 --> 06:06.065
so she likes
to process everything.

06:06.065 --> 06:08.771
Between us, sometimes,
I wonder how her relationship

06:08.771 --> 06:12.311
with Chief even works.
- Oh, so there may be

06:12.311 --> 06:15.818
a crinch in the zeber?
- Uh, maybe.

06:15.818 --> 06:16.820
Hmm.

06:19.325 --> 06:21.697
Oh, boy.
I sure could go for a big bowl

06:21.697 --> 06:23.834
of kibbles and coddle,
right about now,

06:23.934 --> 06:27.742
and then a nice long nap.
- Oh, yeah!

06:27.842 --> 06:31.583
And after that nap, take
another real quick, hard nap.

06:31.583 --> 06:33.988
That would be awesome.
- Then I'd wake up

06:33.988 --> 06:36.359
and chase squirrels
for the rest of the day.

06:36.359 --> 06:38.664
Oh, man, I hate squirrels.

06:38.664 --> 06:40.433
both: But I love chasing them!

06:40.433 --> 06:41.469
Whoa.

06:41.469 --> 06:42.872
It's like you're reading my--

06:42.872 --> 06:45.477
diary.
- Mind--ary.

06:45.477 --> 06:48.918
Oh, Chief,
wouldn't it be a smash

06:48.918 --> 06:51.455
to come up here sometime,
just the two of us?

06:51.455 --> 06:53.894
No Clark?
Sounds awesome.

06:53.894 --> 06:56.667
Well, I'm not doing
anything tonight.

06:56.667 --> 06:58.804
- Oh, me neither.
- Great!

06:58.804 --> 07:00.875
Hey, guys.
What are we talking about?

07:00.875 --> 07:03.079
Come on, Chief.
Let's go find something

07:03.079 --> 07:05.283
stinky to roll in--alone.

07:05.283 --> 07:06.385
Hey, wait up!

07:06.385 --> 07:08.189
Take a hint and get lost,

07:08.189 --> 07:09.626
unless you want
a larch in the garbler.

07:09.626 --> 07:12.431
Not my garbler.

07:17.609 --> 07:19.579
Hi, again.
Thanks for having dinner

07:19.579 --> 07:20.715
with me.
Yeah, uh, no problem.

07:20.815 --> 07:22.785
But can we make it quick?
There's a big yellow ball game

07:22.785 --> 07:24.789
on later.
Oh, if another night would be

07:24.789 --> 07:27.361
better, we can reschedule.
Yeah, you know what?

07:27.361 --> 07:28.764
Let's do that.
Okay, later.

07:28.764 --> 07:30.433
O--o--okay, bye.

07:30.433 --> 07:33.674
I'm all alone.
- No, you're not.

07:33.674 --> 07:35.544
- Who said that?
- Look down.

07:35.544 --> 07:37.114
- Who are you?
- I'm Trey.

07:37.114 --> 07:39.586
I'm a flea--hopped on
at your friend's house.

07:39.586 --> 07:41.322
You seem like
you needed some company.

07:41.322 --> 07:42.792
That was very thoughtful.

07:42.792 --> 07:44.562
Being alone has been
getting to me.

07:44.562 --> 07:47.568
Well, you don't have
to be alone anymore.

07:47.568 --> 07:51.843
I will be with you 24/7.
In fact--nah, never mind.

07:51.843 --> 07:53.580
- What?
- You know, it's just

07:53.580 --> 07:56.485
having one friend--it's great,
don't get me wrong.

07:56.485 --> 07:57.922
But what if I told you

07:57.922 --> 08:00.393
you could have a whole
bunch more friends?

08:03.399 --> 08:05.571
Hello, hi.
I'm Chico.

08:05.571 --> 08:06.840
Nice to meet you.
Jump on.

08:06.840 --> 08:09.512
All right,
I think that's everyone.

08:09.512 --> 08:11.482
Chico, what do you think
of your new squad?

08:11.482 --> 08:13.086
They're beautiful.

08:15.558 --> 08:17.595
<i>I was a little behind
everyone else,</i>

08:17.595 --> 08:20.668
but I aced that walk.
Oh!

08:20.668 --> 08:22.839
And I made a friend.
Her name's Ruby.

08:22.839 --> 08:25.845
She's from Echo Park,
which, judging by her accent,

08:25.845 --> 08:28.049
is in Jamaica, I think.
- Oh, look at you,

08:28.049 --> 08:30.721
making new friends.
You should bring her by group.

08:30.721 --> 08:32.992
Oh, sure, yeah.
I'll find out if she likes

08:32.992 --> 08:34.996
boring stuff.
<i>- We now return to the</i>

08:34.996 --> 08:38.102
<i>Lifetime original movie,
"Watched by a Stranger."</i>

08:38.102 --> 08:40.173
<i>I don't know.
Do you ever just feel</i>

08:40.173 --> 08:43.680
<i>like you're being watched
by a stranger?</i>

08:48.957 --> 08:51.262
Yeah!
Chico's gettin' it!

08:51.262 --> 08:54.268
all: Go Chico!
- Go me!

08:54.268 --> 08:58.376
Go me!

08:58.376 --> 09:00.948
You had your chance.

09:00.948 --> 09:03.887
Epic dance party, guys.
But I got to go to group.

09:03.887 --> 09:05.591
Road trip!

09:05.591 --> 09:07.160
Uh, now, guys, I love you.

09:07.160 --> 09:10.534
I mean, we're squad goals.
But Honey's not as progressive

09:10.534 --> 09:12.505
when it comes to parasites
as I am.

09:12.505 --> 09:13.941
So while we're in there,

09:13.941 --> 09:16.747
please keep it down and cool it
with the skin tickling.

09:16.747 --> 09:20.120
- Boring!
- Shut up, Chet!

09:20.120 --> 09:24.128
Uh, don't worry about it, man.
We'll be cool.

09:24.128 --> 09:26.733
So Elsa,
how's the walking group going?

09:26.733 --> 09:28.904
Well, I'm so glad

09:28.904 --> 09:30.908
you asked me that.
I have made...

09:30.908 --> 09:32.010
- Shh.
- Tons of lady friends.

09:32.010 --> 09:36.051
- Name three.
- Uh, Ruby, Kotex.

09:36.051 --> 09:39.659
The point is, I'm making
friends, and I am itching

09:39.659 --> 09:40.828
to get to know them better.

09:40.828 --> 09:42.899
Itch?

09:42.899 --> 09:44.869
Well, scratch that itch, girl.

09:44.869 --> 09:47.374
- Scratch?
- But play it cool,

09:47.374 --> 09:49.077
or they'll flee.
- Flea?

09:49.077 --> 09:52.250
I'll tell you what really
makes my skin crawl.

09:52.250 --> 09:53.787
Makes?

09:53.787 --> 09:55.925
- What's that sound?
- It's my squad.

09:55.925 --> 09:57.795
- Squad?
- I'm pretty sure I'm crushing

09:57.795 --> 09:59.532
a lot of them,
but I'm just so itchy.

09:59.532 --> 10:01.235
This is not a drill.

10:01.235 --> 10:05.143
Initiate flea protocol.

10:16.833 --> 10:19.471
I'm sorry, Chico.
I don't make the rules.

10:19.471 --> 10:20.574
<i>Yes, you do.</i>

10:20.574 --> 10:22.210
<i>Yes, I do.</i>

10:26.520 --> 10:29.592
- Bla to the dow, chunko!
- Aw.

10:29.592 --> 10:30.761
Where were you last night?

10:30.761 --> 10:32.865
We were supposed to meet
up here for a date.

10:32.865 --> 10:35.771
You meant that?
Oh, I thought we were just

10:35.771 --> 10:38.309
making walk talk.
But also, I can't really

10:38.309 --> 10:41.550
go on dates 'cause of Honey.
- What if there was no Honey?

10:41.550 --> 10:43.419
Oh, well,
then I guess I could.

10:43.419 --> 10:45.156
Ugh, Clark.

10:45.156 --> 10:47.595
I wish you
and your super cool wheels

10:47.695 --> 10:49.064
would just go away forever.

10:49.064 --> 10:50.801
Oh, don't trip, my brother.

10:50.801 --> 10:52.437
Seriously,
we're on a fault line.

10:52.437 --> 10:54.976
Blad--ow!

10:54.976 --> 10:56.880
- Clark!
- Oh, my God,

10:56.880 --> 10:58.216
not again.
- You okay?

10:58.216 --> 10:59.819
- I'ma be sick.
- Dibs.

11:08.369 --> 11:11.977
Hmm...

11:11.977 --> 11:13.479
What's your...

11:13.479 --> 11:16.252
name!

11:20.694 --> 11:22.364
- Password?
- What is that smell?

11:22.364 --> 11:25.036
That was yesterday's
password, but we'll honor it.

11:25.036 --> 11:28.644
I need some information about
an Irish Setter named Ruby.

11:28.744 --> 11:30.179
I have some suspicions
about her

11:30.179 --> 11:33.085
that are completely unrelated
to her being a female animal.

11:33.085 --> 11:36.392
If you think that just
because I'm a scavenger,

11:36.392 --> 11:39.799
that I'm part of a network
of low-lives who dig up dirt

11:39.799 --> 11:41.703
on unsuspecting animals,

11:41.703 --> 11:43.874
then you're exactly right,

11:43.874 --> 11:46.445
and I'll do it if you let me
supermarket sweep

11:46.445 --> 11:47.848
your owner's medicine cabinet.

11:47.848 --> 11:49.752
Mm, sure.
It's mostly fiber pills.

11:49.752 --> 11:52.758
We about to get
litty and loose!

11:56.031 --> 11:58.035
Hey,
you don't need those guys.

11:58.035 --> 12:00.406
You have us now.
- Thanks, Trey.

12:00.406 --> 12:01.242
You're a good friend.

12:01.342 --> 12:02.979
Hey, you know
what'd cheer you up?

12:02.979 --> 12:06.318
Some hot, sexy ticks.

12:06.318 --> 12:10.093
- Show me them tickies!
- Eh, I don't know.

12:10.093 --> 12:12.531
I'm not sure I want
anything else living on me.

12:14.736 --> 12:17.007
Shut it!
Look, hey, you don't wanna

12:17.007 --> 12:19.177
party with us anymore,
that's fine.

12:19.177 --> 12:22.685
We can always go somewhere else
so you can be alone.

12:22.685 --> 12:24.187
- No!
- All right then.

12:24.187 --> 12:27.762
All you gotta do is walk on
into those woods.

12:27.762 --> 12:31.201
Okay.

12:31.201 --> 12:32.605
Whoo!

12:36.245 --> 12:38.984
Ah, it's great to be back
in the whole neighborhood.

12:38.984 --> 12:41.823
You know, I ate my first
cigarette behind that bush.

12:41.823 --> 12:44.696
That was back in 2019.
We didn't know.

12:44.696 --> 12:47.133
Hey, buddy.
Uh-oh.

12:47.133 --> 12:50.608
You got a lot of nerve
showing your face around here.

12:50.608 --> 12:54.515
- Oh, flip!
- You said you loved me!

12:54.515 --> 12:56.987
Look who's back for more.

12:56.987 --> 12:59.024
- These guys aren't talking.
- You're right.

12:59.024 --> 13:00.961
We need to find ourselves
a rat.

13:00.961 --> 13:02.898
Yeah, I know a lot of dogs,

13:02.898 --> 13:05.804
but my memory's not
what it used to be.

13:08.109 --> 13:09.378
Yeah, yeah.
I think I know the dog

13:09.378 --> 13:11.716
you're talking about.
She called herself Cherry,

13:11.716 --> 13:13.085
skipped town not too long ago.

13:13.085 --> 13:14.789
The things I know about her

13:14.789 --> 13:16.325
would knock the stripes
off your tail.

13:16.325 --> 13:20.133
But before I tell you, you
gotta do one more thing for me.

13:20.133 --> 13:21.903
Please say sex.
Please say sex.

13:22.003 --> 13:23.573
Can you untie me
from this thing?

13:23.573 --> 13:26.011
I hate these guys.

13:26.011 --> 13:27.948
This is real bad, man!

13:27.948 --> 13:30.253
We have to get back as fast
as raccoonily possible

13:30.253 --> 13:32.390
to tell Elsa what the rat said.
It's life or death!

13:32.390 --> 13:34.729
We can't let anything
distract us from our--

13:39.037 --> 13:41.509
Okay, three rides,
two snacks, but that's it.

13:44.147 --> 13:45.751
- Hey, watch it!
- What the--?

13:45.751 --> 13:48.422
Are you a flea?
- Yeah, hi, I'm--

13:48.422 --> 13:50.193
No names.
We can do this the easy way

13:50.293 --> 13:52.665
or the hard way.
- You wouldn't.

13:55.904 --> 13:58.744
Oh, no!
Fleas!

13:58.744 --> 14:01.015
Empty!
No!

14:01.015 --> 14:02.852
Hold on, sweet girl.

14:02.852 --> 14:04.889
You are so screwed.

14:04.989 --> 14:07.595
Those fleas messed
with the wrong childless,

14:07.595 --> 14:10.466
overcompensating dog mom.

14:11.168 --> 14:14.041
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God!

14:21.055 --> 14:23.960
Oh, I don't know
how I didn't see the car.

14:23.960 --> 14:26.298
Aw, don't feel bad.
I once got run over

14:26.298 --> 14:28.402
by a parade.
It was pretty fun.

14:28.402 --> 14:31.108
I met Al Roker.
- I was just dropping by

14:31.108 --> 14:34.214
to see this fabulous Honey
I've heard so much about.

14:34.214 --> 14:36.452
Fabulous?
I don't know about that.

14:36.452 --> 14:39.091
I mean, well, it does track.
- I know it was just

14:39.091 --> 14:41.195
a little bump,
but I'm a bit jankered.

14:41.195 --> 14:44.167
If only I knew someone
who would help me process

14:44.167 --> 14:47.675
this traumatic event.
You know, like a counselor

14:47.675 --> 14:49.478
or a... therapist.

14:49.478 --> 14:51.148
I'm a therapist!

14:51.148 --> 14:52.918
Maybe we could take a walk

14:52.918 --> 14:55.958
later to somewhere private.
- Oh, absolutely!

14:55.958 --> 14:59.364
Oh, great.
Your bed is so comfortable.

14:59.364 --> 15:01.068
Thanks for letting me
rest in it.

15:01.068 --> 15:02.938
Of course,
what's mine is yours.

15:02.938 --> 15:04.441
- It will be.
- What?

15:04.441 --> 15:05.276
What?

15:05.410 --> 15:08.583
all: Chug, chug, chug,
chug, chug, chug!

15:08.583 --> 15:10.687
Yeah!

15:12.591 --> 15:14.829
Tr-Trey?
Trey?

15:14.829 --> 15:16.098
Make it quick.
I've only got Crystal

15:16.198 --> 15:17.233
for, like, five more minutes.

15:17.233 --> 15:19.639
I love hanging out
with you guys,

15:19.639 --> 15:22.043
but I have
very little blood left,

15:22.143 --> 15:25.416
so I think it's time
to dial back the party.

15:25.416 --> 15:29.391
You don't get it, do you?
This body is ours now,

15:29.391 --> 15:33.733
and we're not leaving
until every last drop of blood

15:33.733 --> 15:35.336
is gone.

15:35.336 --> 15:39.879
Puke and rally!

15:43.119 --> 15:44.655
We got here
as fast as we could.

15:44.655 --> 15:47.995
- What did you find out?
- Ruby's real name is Cherry.

15:47.995 --> 15:49.632
And she's a total psycho.

15:49.632 --> 15:52.003
Hey,
that's really insensitive.

15:52.003 --> 15:53.573
But yeah, I mean,
she's totally nuts.

15:53.573 --> 15:56.278
Back in Echo Park, she became
obsessed with this foxhound,

15:56.278 --> 15:58.315
<i>but the foxhound had a mate.</i>

15:58.315 --> 16:00.052
<i>Ruby tried to get
all chummy with him,</i>

16:00.052 --> 16:02.190
<i>but the mate wasn't buying it.</i>

16:02.190 --> 16:04.962
Do you smell something?

16:07.267 --> 16:08.904
both: Cherry?

16:09.004 --> 16:10.841
both: No!

16:10.841 --> 16:12.343
<i>Anyway, their house blew up.</i>

16:12.343 --> 16:14.749
And she didn't
even look back?

16:14.749 --> 16:16.619
I have to warn Honey and Chief.

16:18.657 --> 16:22.832
- Chico?
- Look, I'm popular.

16:22.832 --> 16:24.234
Oh, no.
Chico, we gotta get rid

16:24.234 --> 16:25.504
of them
before they bleed you dry.

16:25.504 --> 16:29.110
But they're my squad.
I was lonely,

16:29.110 --> 16:32.250
and now I'm not.
So go away.

16:32.350 --> 16:35.189
all: Yeah, go away!
- Chico, please!

16:35.189 --> 16:36.726
They're killing you.

16:36.726 --> 16:39.331
I'm fine.

16:44.174 --> 16:46.411
Honey, you're in danger!

16:46.411 --> 16:49.819
Ruby wants to kill you
and take over your life.

16:49.819 --> 16:50.787
What's going on?

16:50.787 --> 16:52.190
What is she doing here?

16:52.190 --> 16:54.562
She's staying with us
until Jill finds her human.

16:54.562 --> 16:57.801
Honey, no, don't believe her.
She doesn't even have a human,

16:57.801 --> 17:00.306
do you, Cherry?
- Cherry?

17:00.306 --> 17:03.479
Yeah, that's her real name,
and she's a total psychopath!

17:03.479 --> 17:06.553
Ask any raccoon!
- Oh, Honey, you've got

17:06.553 --> 17:08.990
your paws full
with this little duffle pump.

17:08.990 --> 17:11.361
She's two potatoes shy
of a mash.

17:11.361 --> 17:13.399
Yeah, talk therapy
has its limits,

17:13.399 --> 17:15.938
and I can't legally prescribe.
Oh, well.

17:15.938 --> 17:17.373
How about we take
that walk now?

17:17.373 --> 17:19.879
- I'd like that.
- And let's get into that

17:19.879 --> 17:21.950
trauma-lama-ding-dong.

17:21.950 --> 17:24.087
I mean,
if you're ready to share.

17:26.291 --> 17:29.732
Honey, she just
looked at me menacingly.

17:29.732 --> 17:32.571
Menacingly!

17:34.074 --> 17:36.011
- You caw-caw'd?
- Ruby's not Ruby.

17:36.011 --> 17:37.514
She's Cherry,
and she's a murderer.

17:37.514 --> 17:39.885
She's gonna kill Honey
so she can be with you

17:39.885 --> 17:42.257
and take over her life!

17:42.257 --> 17:45.096
Okay,
I'ma need that one more time.

17:45.096 --> 17:47.133
I can't imagine

17:47.133 --> 17:48.970
how heavy you'd be with blood.

17:51.141 --> 17:52.410
There's a reason all the fleas

17:52.410 --> 17:54.014
in this house know
to leave us alone.

17:54.014 --> 17:57.554
And it's right here.

18:01.596 --> 18:03.465
It's a little spooky
up here at night.

18:03.465 --> 18:07.473
Don't worry.
We're all alone.

18:07.473 --> 18:12.116
- Come on, buddy.
- I can't do it, Gray One.

18:12.116 --> 18:13.887
I don't wanna go back
to being alone.

18:13.887 --> 18:17.393
You're not alone, Cheeks.
I'll always be by your side.

18:17.393 --> 18:21.268
Whoa, Chico.
What about your squad?

18:25.242 --> 18:27.915
Sorry, Trey.
Party's over.

18:27.915 --> 18:30.921
No!

18:39.204 --> 18:41.208
Oh, no.

18:41.308 --> 18:45.116
Chico?

18:45.116 --> 18:47.888
We did it!
I'm finally free!

18:47.888 --> 18:50.894
Thank you, The Pink One.

18:50.894 --> 18:52.263
I'll never forget you.

18:52.263 --> 18:55.102
I mean, I think there's room
on there for both of us.

18:55.102 --> 18:56.873
Uh...

18:56.873 --> 19:00.514
Ah, it's beautiful up here--
great place to plumb the depths

19:00.514 --> 19:03.152
of your subconscious.
You go first.

19:03.152 --> 19:05.456
Hey, why don't we talk
in that cave?

19:05.456 --> 19:07.728
Yeah, okay, let's cave it up,
girl!

19:09.197 --> 19:11.736
Ooh, it's dark in here
like the womb.

19:11.736 --> 19:14.307
Speaking of,
what's your earliest memory?

19:14.307 --> 19:15.711
Where do you think
this pit goes?

19:15.711 --> 19:18.082
I don't know,
but it looks pretty deep.

19:18.082 --> 19:19.719
I bet if someone fell in,
they'd fall--

19:19.719 --> 19:21.054
All the way to hell!

19:21.054 --> 19:22.357
Stupid fleas.

19:22.357 --> 19:23.793
Wait, were you just

19:23.793 --> 19:27.968
about to push me into the pit
without an accent?

19:27.968 --> 19:29.572
Yes, and now you can plunge

19:29.572 --> 19:31.509
to your death
knowing the truth.

19:31.509 --> 19:34.682
- Why are you doing this?
- It's nothing personal.

19:34.682 --> 19:37.588
You just have something
I want, and after all I've

19:37.588 --> 19:39.625
suffered through,
I know better than to wait

19:39.625 --> 19:42.363
for someone to give it to me.
- Don't this, Ruby.

19:42.363 --> 19:43.499
We've all suffered.

19:43.499 --> 19:46.138
No one has suffered
like I have!

19:46.138 --> 19:47.508
I was taken from my mother

19:47.508 --> 19:50.146
and my siblings
when I was just 12 weeks old.

19:50.146 --> 19:51.381
The people who took me

19:51.381 --> 19:54.220
made me sleep in a cage
and eat off the floor.

19:54.220 --> 19:56.692
I would have to beg
for scraps of food.

19:56.692 --> 19:57.661
Beg!

19:57.828 --> 20:00.433
That all sounds
like pretty standard dog stuff.

20:00.433 --> 20:02.538
But I love that you're talking.
- Shut up.

20:02.538 --> 20:05.076
You have no idea
how good you have it.

20:05.076 --> 20:06.813
That's why I'm gonna take it
from you.

20:06.813 --> 20:07.480
No!

20:07.480 --> 20:10.119
Let me go!

20:10.219 --> 20:11.556
- Never!
- Honey!

20:11.556 --> 20:14.595
- Elsa, help!
- Hold on!

20:14.595 --> 20:17.166
I can't do it.
You're too heavy,

20:17.166 --> 20:19.270
and I'm just a slip
of a thing.

20:19.270 --> 20:21.408
I'm sorry I doubted you,
Elsa!

20:21.408 --> 20:23.546
It's okay!
It would be cruel of me

20:23.546 --> 20:26.051
not to forgive you
considering the circumstances.

20:26.051 --> 20:29.725
Blimey, how has no one tried
to off both of you knackies

20:29.725 --> 20:32.196
before this?
- Oh, now your accent's back

20:32.196 --> 20:33.600
for Elsa?
- Really?

20:33.600 --> 20:36.271
Elsa, focus!

20:36.271 --> 20:38.610
Oh, no!

20:38.610 --> 20:42.049
- I got you!
- You'll never get me.

20:47.628 --> 20:50.366
And this is why
I don't exercise.

20:54.340 --> 20:57.648
<i>I can't even look at that
cave without wondering</i>

20:57.648 --> 21:01.221
<i>"Am I safe,
or will Ruby be back</i>

21:01.221 --> 21:03.593
to finish what she started?"

21:03.593 --> 21:06.465
Well, first of all,
she tried to kill me, not you,

21:06.465 --> 21:09.471
and second,
Ruby can't hurt anyone anymore.

21:11.709 --> 21:13.513
Please pick me.
Please pick me.

21:13.613 --> 21:16.619
Oh, good day, kind family.
Care to bring me home?

21:16.619 --> 21:19.090
No?
Well, your kid's [bleep] ugly!

21:20.493 --> 21:22.898
Oh, look at this one!
Can we get her?

21:22.898 --> 21:24.467
Can we?
- Sure thing, kiddo.

21:24.467 --> 21:26.238
Let's go make that happen.
