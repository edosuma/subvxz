WEBVTT

01:17.477 --> 01:19.581
We have reports of shots fired,

01:19.614 --> 01:21.716
residence, between
North Highland

01:21.749 --> 01:23.350
and Rosewood Avenue.

01:32.927 --> 01:34.796
Arrived at residence.

01:34.829 --> 01:36.564
Multiple units on the ground.

01:44.706 --> 01:47.274
Suspect reported to be on foot

01:47.307 --> 01:49.877
heading toward Melrose Avenue.

01:49.911 --> 01:51.445
Armed and dangerous.

02:28.783 --> 02:30.183
Everybody on the ground!

02:32.386 --> 02:33.655
Now!

03:24.038 --> 03:25.640
Damn it.

03:49.630 --> 03:52.934
"Gallery 86 is now
one month behind on payment.

03:52.967 --> 03:56.236
If payment is not remitted
by blah, blah, blah..."

04:05.312 --> 04:07.782
Declined, declined,
declined, declined.

04:07.815 --> 04:09.050
Stop behaving like a child.

04:09.083 --> 04:10.585
What are you doing?

04:10.618 --> 04:11.919
We're minutes away from opening.

04:11.953 --> 04:13.353
No, what are you doing?

04:13.386 --> 04:14.989
We put everything we had
into this gallery.

04:15.022 --> 04:16.456
You said it was doing well.

04:16.490 --> 04:17.925
Where's the fucking money?

04:17.959 --> 04:19.359
It's the economy.

04:19.392 --> 04:20.561
Have you been living
under a rock?

04:20.595 --> 04:22.930
- Bullshit.
- It's true.

04:22.964 --> 04:25.398
I need you
to promise me something.

04:26.333 --> 04:27.502
What?

04:27.535 --> 04:30.403
That I wasn't wrong
to trust you.

04:30.437 --> 04:32.807
Cross my heart.

04:32.840 --> 04:35.810
This exhibit
better bring in some money.

04:43.684 --> 04:46.821
Everything is gonna be...

04:46.854 --> 04:48.756
okay.

04:53.528 --> 04:57.430
You are gonna be okay.

05:08.943 --> 05:10.343
Just keep breathing.

05:19.419 --> 05:20.822
Okay.

05:42.610 --> 05:44.645
This was a bad idea.

05:53.754 --> 05:55.422
You can do this.

05:57.158 --> 05:58.926
I can do this.

06:15.109 --> 06:16.978
You know what?

06:17.011 --> 06:19.513
I am so glad
I finally found time

06:19.547 --> 06:20.882
to swing by and see you.

06:20.915 --> 06:21.983
Yeah, I'm really glad!

06:22.016 --> 06:23.684
It's nice to have you over
for dinner finally,

06:23.718 --> 06:25.452
- after all these years.
- Too long.

06:25.485 --> 06:27.188
It has been too long.

06:37.231 --> 06:38.733
Madeline, I'm home.

06:38.766 --> 06:41.035
Oh!

06:41.068 --> 06:43.504
I'm so glad you're home early
tonight, honey!

06:43.537 --> 06:44.538
Hey!

06:44.572 --> 06:46.574
This is Dallas,
he's visiting from Indiana.

06:46.607 --> 06:48.576
- Remember I told you?
- Great to meet you, man.

06:48.609 --> 06:49.710
- Hey.
- Madeline's told me

06:49.744 --> 06:51.679
- so much about you.
- Glad you're finally meeting!

06:51.712 --> 06:53.047
Have a seat, babe!

06:55.683 --> 06:57.218
So how was your day?

06:57.251 --> 07:00.688
Oh, you know how it is.

07:00.721 --> 07:05.760
Four clogged toilets,
three slowly draining sinks,

07:05.793 --> 07:08.729
and one leaky faucet.

07:08.763 --> 07:10.998
Well, Travis is
the best plumber in the area.

07:11.032 --> 07:13.234
- They only trust his work.
- Oh, cool.

07:13.267 --> 07:15.036
Wine? Oh, no,
I think you're good.

07:15.069 --> 07:16.170
I'm good, yeah.

07:18.139 --> 07:22.209
Madeline told me you served
Iraq, Afghanistan.

07:24.045 --> 07:27.081
So Dallas is in town visiting
his cousin for a few days,

07:27.114 --> 07:29.750
and I invited him
to come over and have dinner.

07:29.784 --> 07:31.218
It's been forever
since we've seen each other.

07:31.252 --> 07:33.187
We went to the same high school
back in Marion

07:33.220 --> 07:35.189
and our parents are
actually longtime friends.

07:35.222 --> 07:37.258
Yeah.

07:37.291 --> 07:38.960
What do you do?

07:38.993 --> 07:39.961
Oh.

07:41.028 --> 07:42.763
I'm a software engineer.

07:44.732 --> 07:46.200
Sounds boring.

07:46.233 --> 07:48.135
Oh, yeah, it is, it is,

07:48.169 --> 07:50.705
but you know,
it pays the mortgage, so...

07:52.039 --> 07:53.240
That's fair.

07:55.009 --> 07:56.610
You want some chicken?

07:56.644 --> 07:58.112
Mm, yeah.

07:58.145 --> 08:00.881
Salad, too. Can't quite reach.

08:00.915 --> 08:02.016
Dallas, could you
pass the salad?

08:02.049 --> 08:03.284
Thanks.

08:17.798 --> 08:20.067
- Didn't mean to startle you.
- No, it's all right.

08:21.969 --> 08:24.705
- You look great.
- Thank you, likewise.

08:26.040 --> 08:27.641
- Bubbly?
- Thank you.

08:33.581 --> 08:34.949
To you, my dear.

08:34.982 --> 08:36.851
To our friendship.

08:39.020 --> 08:40.921
Mm, I have been dying
to get the artist's tour.

08:40.955 --> 08:43.524
Oh, well, I would love
to give it to you.

08:44.992 --> 08:48.095
So this one was
at a crazy music festival,

08:48.129 --> 08:50.031
and this one just
really caught the vibe,

08:50.064 --> 08:51.065
but you know what?

08:51.098 --> 08:54.001
Let me just show you
my favorite.

08:54.035 --> 08:56.604
Okay, so this one was
in Thailand five years ago,

08:56.637 --> 08:58.873
the most beautiful sunset
I've ever seen.

08:58.906 --> 09:02.276
Okay, now, back up with me,
just a little bit.

09:02.309 --> 09:04.779
- Do you see the change?
- The colors just come together.

09:04.812 --> 09:07.114
- Exactly.
- What about this one?

09:08.816 --> 09:13.754
St. John's Church,
Byblos, Lebanon.

09:13.788 --> 09:15.990
Nadia Morcos's images...

09:18.826 --> 09:25.032
...altogether express
the dichotomy of time.

09:46.921 --> 09:48.689
Let me tell you a bit
about this collection.

09:48.722 --> 09:50.624
Yeah, I'd love to hear that!

09:50.658 --> 09:52.960
They were taken in Paris
in 2000.

09:52.993 --> 09:55.663
Don't you love the architecture
on these buildings?

09:55.696 --> 09:58.399
And this is outside
the Cafe Balzac.

09:58.432 --> 09:59.934
Are you getting all this
or am I...

09:59.967 --> 10:00.801
do I need to back it up?

10:00.835 --> 10:03.637
I've been doing this
for 10 years.

10:03.671 --> 10:05.339
I've followed your work
in the past.

10:05.372 --> 10:07.141
You've been quite consistent!

10:07.174 --> 10:09.643
- Thank you.
- Oh, hi, Bill.

10:09.677 --> 10:10.945
And quite eclectic.

10:10.978 --> 10:12.313
Excuse me.

10:12.346 --> 10:14.849
So, who is this artist?

10:14.882 --> 10:16.150
She's from Lebanon.

10:16.183 --> 10:17.284
It's her first exhibit

10:17.318 --> 10:19.787
following
a recent career change.

10:19.820 --> 10:21.755
- She was an...
- ER nurse.

10:21.789 --> 10:23.858
Couldn't handle
the stress anymore.

10:23.891 --> 10:26.994
Nadia, this is Bill
from The Los Angeles Review...

10:27.027 --> 10:28.796
- Nice to meet you, Bill.
- ...and Cathy

10:28.829 --> 10:30.030
from Blueprint Arts.

10:30.064 --> 10:32.733
Very nice to meet you.

10:32.766 --> 10:34.135
You three get acquainted.

10:34.168 --> 10:35.703
I have guests to schmooze.

10:35.736 --> 10:36.871
Pardon me.

10:40.774 --> 10:44.912
And your name is Handsome?

10:44.945 --> 10:48.749
- Ross.
- Ross.

10:48.782 --> 10:51.418
So what does Ross do?

10:51.452 --> 10:54.388
- Collect.
- Collect.

10:54.421 --> 10:56.991
Anything in particular?

10:57.024 --> 10:59.226
Anything I particularly like.

10:59.260 --> 11:01.328
Nice!

11:01.362 --> 11:03.697
Follow me.

11:07.201 --> 11:10.971
To Nadia and the start
of a brilliant career.

11:11.005 --> 11:13.908
To you, Craig,
for your continuous support

11:13.941 --> 11:15.209
and for constantly nagging me

11:15.242 --> 11:17.144
to hold my first exhibit.

11:17.178 --> 11:19.246
I had no choice, darling.

11:19.280 --> 11:22.016
Your photographs speak
to the beauty of life

11:22.049 --> 11:23.350
better than any poem.

11:23.384 --> 11:26.153
I just had to have them.

11:26.187 --> 11:29.490
But please,
don't take my word for it.

11:29.524 --> 11:33.260
Peruse, ponder,

11:33.294 --> 11:35.296
and purchase.

11:37.031 --> 11:39.833
Your work has lots
of blossoms and blooms.

11:39.867 --> 11:41.869
Is there some kind
of underscore?

11:41.902 --> 11:45.206
Yes, actually,
rebirth and new beginnings.

11:45.239 --> 11:47.308
A fresh start for my body,
mind, and spirit.

11:47.341 --> 11:49.743
So your work reflects
personal experience then.

11:49.777 --> 11:52.246
Absolutely. Growing up
in war-torn Lebanon

11:52.279 --> 11:54.315
and then later immigrating
to the States.

11:54.348 --> 11:55.449
How long ago?

11:55.482 --> 11:58.352
Gosh, like 20 years ago?

11:58.385 --> 12:00.955
And have you always wanted
to be a photographer?

12:00.988 --> 12:03.190
For as long as I can remember.

12:03.224 --> 12:05.025
I used to cut photographs
from magazines

12:05.059 --> 12:06.460
when I was a kid.

12:06.493 --> 12:09.531
Anything that spoke to what
I was feeling in the moment.

12:09.564 --> 12:13.033
And then I used to hide them
in my pencil drawer.

12:13.067 --> 12:14.835
And this is your first exhibit?

12:14.868 --> 12:16.837
- Yes.
- Your job is not

12:16.870 --> 12:19.507
to judge the artist,
but the art.

12:19.541 --> 12:21.442
I'm getting to know
the artist first.

12:21.475 --> 12:23.177
Her bio is on these walls!

12:23.210 --> 12:25.045
There, there!

12:25.079 --> 12:27.248
- What else do you need?
- What's your problem, Bill?

12:27.281 --> 12:29.116
I don't have a problem, Cath,

12:29.149 --> 12:32.419
because fortunately,
you don't work for me.

12:32.453 --> 12:35.856
Because you can't afford me.

12:35.889 --> 12:39.561
Colleagues.
We really love each other.

12:39.594 --> 12:43.097
- So tell me more about this.
- Sure.

12:43.130 --> 12:46.100
So this I took in Paris,
actually.

12:46.133 --> 12:49.837
It was one of
my favorite photos.

12:49.870 --> 12:52.006
- This is great, honey.
- Good, I'm glad you like it.

12:52.039 --> 12:53.874
- What do you think?
- It's really good.

12:53.907 --> 12:56.143
- Good, good.
- You're a good cook.

12:56.176 --> 12:57.545
It's not my mom's cooking,
but...

12:57.579 --> 12:58.846
Really good.

12:59.581 --> 13:02.316
All right, I gotta ask.

13:04.351 --> 13:06.554
You got any crazy stories
from over there?

13:08.623 --> 13:09.857
No.

13:12.192 --> 13:13.427
- Okay.
- Travis doesn't like

13:13.460 --> 13:15.429
to talk about the war.

13:15.462 --> 13:16.430
Oh.

13:17.565 --> 13:18.999
I get it.

13:20.502 --> 13:21.835
Okay.

14:05.312 --> 14:07.181
Not bad, huh?

14:07.214 --> 14:10.351
I like that one.

14:10.384 --> 14:15.255
Do you know where I could find
a Mr. Beaumont?

14:15.289 --> 14:17.925
Look at all these photos.

14:17.958 --> 14:20.394
Different places!

14:20.427 --> 14:22.496
I want to go there.

14:22.530 --> 14:25.899
I'd even take a job like yours
to make it happen.

14:25.933 --> 14:27.669
You mean this?

14:27.702 --> 14:30.104
At least you get to be outside
moving around,

14:30.137 --> 14:32.373
not stuck between walls like me.

14:32.406 --> 14:34.441
I can do more than this.

14:34.475 --> 14:37.111
But I've also got
rent to pay, you know?

14:38.546 --> 14:40.381
How are those?

14:40.414 --> 14:41.516
So-so.

14:41.549 --> 14:43.585
I'm hypoglycemic.

14:43.618 --> 14:46.120
You keep those, I'll get my own.

14:49.657 --> 14:52.226
You're not wearing a ring.

14:52.259 --> 14:53.661
Not anymore.

14:53.695 --> 14:57.297
So why is a handsome guy
like you still on the loose?

14:57.331 --> 14:59.099
I don't believe in marriage.

14:59.133 --> 15:01.603
- Didn't work for me.
- Can't agree with you more.

15:01.636 --> 15:03.538
Personally,
I'd never put my future

15:03.571 --> 15:05.507
in someone else's hands.

15:05.540 --> 15:07.408
Interesting way to put it!

15:07.441 --> 15:08.976
Let me get you some wine.

15:09.009 --> 15:10.277
Thanks, but...

15:10.310 --> 15:11.945
I've had my last drink.

15:11.979 --> 15:14.014
Ah, clean and sober.

15:14.047 --> 15:16.984
No, just sober.

15:17.017 --> 15:22.590
Women, very complex
and incredibly hormonal.

15:22.624 --> 15:24.324
Is that what it is?

15:24.358 --> 15:27.227
Men, so much easier.

15:30.130 --> 15:32.433
I like this piece.

15:32.466 --> 15:36.136
You, my dear,
have a fabulous taste.

15:36.170 --> 15:39.741
This is part
of a larger collection.

15:39.774 --> 15:42.042
But let me show you the rest.

15:42.075 --> 15:45.580
I like to think of them
as, well,

15:45.613 --> 15:47.749
a dealmaker.

15:47.782 --> 15:50.350
Here, follow me.

16:15.108 --> 16:19.446
You know, I will say

16:19.480 --> 16:23.116
I feel like we gave
those people their freedom,

16:23.150 --> 16:25.419
and they owe us big, you know?

16:27.120 --> 16:28.088
What do they owe you?

16:29.223 --> 16:31.225
Well, we liberated them.

16:32.259 --> 16:33.494
Liberated them from what?

16:36.396 --> 16:37.699
Liberated them from what?

16:40.602 --> 16:42.302
All their leaders?

16:42.336 --> 16:43.671
I mean, their leaders to start,

16:43.705 --> 16:46.240
but then they had
all those little groups,

16:46.273 --> 16:48.242
and I felt like
we kinda liberated them

16:48.275 --> 16:50.678
from those groups, too.

16:50.712 --> 16:52.312
What do you know about it, huh?

16:52.346 --> 16:53.748
No, really, tell me,
what do you know?

16:53.781 --> 16:55.015
Because,
from where I'm standing,

16:55.048 --> 16:59.052
I think you were just sitting
comfortably behind a computer

16:59.086 --> 17:01.388
in Marion, Indiana.

17:06.260 --> 17:09.631
You know, I watch the news,
and I just feel like

17:09.664 --> 17:11.599
we should have let them
ride their camels

17:11.633 --> 17:13.467
like they ride their wives,
you know?

17:15.168 --> 17:17.371
Baby, please.

17:17.404 --> 17:19.807
You're sitting at my table.

17:19.841 --> 17:23.678
You're eating my food,
drinking my wine,

17:23.711 --> 17:26.246
and you're gonna be
disrespectful

17:26.280 --> 17:28.415
in front of my wife?

17:28.448 --> 17:31.084
I was just trying
to make conversation.

17:31.118 --> 17:32.720
Okay?

17:32.754 --> 17:34.656
Babe.

17:36.858 --> 17:39.794
Let's just enjoy our dinner.

17:39.827 --> 17:43.330
I do feel like
we gave them too much

17:43.363 --> 17:45.867
and we sacrificed too much
for nothing back in return.

17:45.900 --> 17:46.768
Dallas.

17:48.836 --> 17:50.672
I'm not gonna sit here
and say I don't.

17:50.705 --> 17:53.541
They didn't deserve all
that we sacrificed for them.

17:53.575 --> 17:54.876
I will stand by that.

17:54.909 --> 17:56.844
What did you sacrifice for them?

17:56.878 --> 17:58.245
Get the fuck off me!

17:58.278 --> 17:59.747
No, please, both of you, stop!

17:59.781 --> 18:01.481
What the fuck do you know?

18:01.516 --> 18:03.150
You've got
a fucking temper, man.

18:03.183 --> 18:05.452
- Yeah?
- Oh, my God.

18:12.326 --> 18:14.294
Get out of my house
or I'll fucking kill you.

18:14.328 --> 18:15.863
Baby, please.

18:18.265 --> 18:20.500
You're really gonna kill me?

18:26.808 --> 18:29.209
Travis, please stop!

18:31.278 --> 18:33.146
Travis, please stop!

18:36.517 --> 18:38.586
Oh! Oh, my God!

18:38.620 --> 18:41.488
Travis!

18:43.256 --> 18:45.459
Travis, call an ambulance!

18:47.194 --> 18:48.796
- Travis!
- Shit!

18:56.303 --> 18:57.672
She demands your attention.

18:57.705 --> 18:59.439
Absolutely.

18:59.473 --> 19:00.875
I'm gonna look at her bio.

19:00.908 --> 19:03.176
Great, I'll catch up
with you later.

19:03.210 --> 19:06.213
- You got him on the hook?
- Working on him.

19:07.715 --> 19:10.952
Listen, I wanted
to apologize about earlier.

19:10.985 --> 19:13.755
I know things are difficult
and I'm on you all the time...

19:13.788 --> 19:16.423
It's that fiery passion
that drew me to you.

19:18.425 --> 19:20.628
I'm just worried
about our finances, that's all.

19:20.662 --> 19:23.831
I know, I know.

19:23.865 --> 19:25.800
Is there anything
I can do to help?

19:25.833 --> 19:28.503
Actually, yes,
it's a bit warm in here.

19:28.536 --> 19:30.370
Would you mind putting my jacket
in the office?

19:30.404 --> 19:31.973
Absolutely.

20:15.983 --> 20:21.488
Nadia Morcos's images
hang proudly at Gallery 86,

20:21.522 --> 20:23.925
all at once capturing
the frailty of life

20:23.958 --> 20:26.259
as well as its beauty.

20:26.293 --> 20:28.763
Seemingly
inconsequential moments

20:28.796 --> 20:35.036
transformed into
expressions of life, love,

20:35.069 --> 20:38.940
and the connection
of all things.

20:47.582 --> 20:48.950
You sound as though
the photographer

20:48.983 --> 20:50.618
has made you a fan of her work.

20:50.651 --> 20:51.886
Ah, yes.

20:51.919 --> 20:53.755
Habit.

20:53.788 --> 20:55.455
As I get older,
my short-term memory

20:55.489 --> 20:56.958
is not what it once was.

20:56.991 --> 20:59.694
Time has a way
of erasing things.

20:59.727 --> 21:01.796
Perhaps occasionally
for the best.

21:01.829 --> 21:03.064
Have you met the artist?

21:03.097 --> 21:05.533
I haven't had the pleasure yet.

21:05.566 --> 21:08.435
But it would seem
our history precedes us.

21:08.468 --> 21:10.571
What do you think?

21:10.605 --> 21:12.774
- I think she's talented.
- Very.

21:12.807 --> 21:14.709
- We need to talk.
- In a moment.

21:14.742 --> 21:16.644
- Now.
- I'm sorry, Bill,

21:16.677 --> 21:17.912
will you excuse me
for one moment?

21:17.945 --> 21:19.781
- Sure.
- Excuse me.

21:23.951 --> 21:25.318
This better be good.

21:25.352 --> 21:26.854
Is this where
all the money's going?

21:26.888 --> 21:29.389
Not now.

21:29.422 --> 21:31.324
I told you
I can't be with a user.

21:31.358 --> 21:32.860
You know my only brother OD'd.

21:34.529 --> 21:36.496
- It's just tonight.
- Bullshit!

21:37.565 --> 21:39.000
And you promised me.

21:39.033 --> 21:41.068
I'm sorry I believed you.

22:10.131 --> 22:13.034
Don't worry, there's gonna be
some more buyers.

22:13.067 --> 22:15.402
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

22:15.435 --> 22:18.806
So we're now featuring
up-and-coming artists.

22:18.840 --> 22:21.642
They're looking at you.

22:21.676 --> 22:24.512
Yeah, I'm not a fan of that one.

22:24.545 --> 22:26.647
Right this way.

22:26.681 --> 22:29.750
Oh, you know,
better I meet the artist first.

22:29.784 --> 22:32.086
Absolutely.

22:32.119 --> 22:33.688
Bill, can I have a word
with you, please?

22:33.721 --> 22:37.792
You work is very impressive.

22:37.825 --> 22:40.427
It seems inspired
by life's experiences.

22:40.460 --> 22:42.864
Well, that's unavoidable.

22:42.897 --> 22:45.633
Oh, excuse me.

22:45.666 --> 22:46.868
Ah.

22:49.770 --> 22:53.808
Sorry, I have to respond
to an event for tomorrow.

22:53.841 --> 22:55.543
She's pretty.

22:55.576 --> 22:57.011
Your wife?

22:57.044 --> 22:59.013
Was my wife.

22:59.046 --> 23:01.716
Your work is so expressive,

23:01.749 --> 23:03.918
and this one, this one,

23:03.951 --> 23:07.788
there's a striking aspect
of loneliness.

23:07.822 --> 23:10.558
- Loneliness?
- Yeah.

23:10.591 --> 23:13.060
There's life in every single one
of my pieces.

23:13.094 --> 23:15.196
Yeah, like this one.

23:15.229 --> 23:20.067
It's like an empty house
longing to be inhabitated,

23:20.101 --> 23:22.169
perhaps suggesting
there's something missing

23:22.203 --> 23:23.938
in your life.

23:23.971 --> 23:27.608
Well, there's
nothing missing tonight.

23:27.642 --> 23:29.442
Except buyers.

23:31.712 --> 23:33.014
Do you feel lonely?

23:34.682 --> 23:36.150
I might.

23:36.183 --> 23:38.485
If more people don't show up.

23:38.519 --> 23:41.889
Guess who's being featured
in The Los Angeles Review!

23:41.923 --> 23:43.758
- You, my dear!
- Really?

23:43.791 --> 23:45.159
- That's great!
- Excuse me, bro.

23:45.192 --> 23:46.761
- I've got, um...
- Hold that thought

23:46.794 --> 23:48.162
for five minutes.

23:48.195 --> 23:49.496
Be right back!

23:49.530 --> 23:50.765
Hi, let me introduce myself.

23:50.798 --> 23:52.199
My name's Avi Dahan.

23:52.233 --> 23:53.901
I'm your neighbor.

23:53.935 --> 23:55.903
Neigh... oh, you live on Fairfax!

23:55.937 --> 23:57.772
No, I'm from Israel.

23:57.805 --> 24:00.174
Oh, those neighbors.

24:00.207 --> 24:02.009
The ones that invaded
my country.

24:02.043 --> 24:04.645
- I didn't invade your country.
- Oh, no?

24:04.679 --> 24:06.881
You just left that
up to your countrymen?

24:08.182 --> 24:09.617
Everybody on the ground!

24:12.253 --> 24:13.788
Now!

24:16.624 --> 24:18.759
Get on the ground!

24:18.793 --> 24:22.096
My legs... I can't move my legs.

24:24.265 --> 24:26.734
I said get on the ground!

24:26.767 --> 24:28.035
Why didn't you?

24:29.704 --> 24:33.674
Listen,
everybody just do what I say

24:33.708 --> 24:35.042
and no one gets hurt.

24:35.076 --> 24:36.844
Whose phone is that?

24:36.877 --> 24:39.213
- Whose phone?
- It's mine, it's mine!

24:39.246 --> 24:40.748
Turn it off.

24:40.781 --> 24:41.716
You know what,
just give it to me.

24:41.749 --> 24:45.186
- Give it to me.
- Okay, all right, take it.

24:46.654 --> 24:48.756
Okay.

24:48.789 --> 24:50.558
You know what,
everybody take out their phones,

24:50.591 --> 24:52.760
wallets, and purses,
slide them to me.

24:54.095 --> 24:56.063
Do it now, slide 'em!

24:56.097 --> 24:59.066
Take 'em out, phones,
wallets, purses, come on!

25:02.837 --> 25:04.538
Give me your phone,
give me your phone!

25:04.572 --> 25:06.774
- Come on!
- There, there, there!

25:09.343 --> 25:11.946
Okay, over here.

25:11.979 --> 25:14.749
You got a phone?

25:14.782 --> 25:16.183
You?

25:16.217 --> 25:18.252
Anybody else?

25:18.285 --> 25:19.653
- Is anybody back there?
- No, no.

25:19.687 --> 25:20.855
Is anybody back there?

25:20.888 --> 25:22.823
No, no!

25:22.857 --> 25:25.259
All right, no funny business.

25:25.292 --> 25:28.763
Don't try anything stupid, okay?

25:28.796 --> 25:30.765
Is this it?

25:30.798 --> 25:31.866
Anybody else?

25:31.899 --> 25:34.201
Phones, wallets! Anything else!

25:36.704 --> 25:37.972
Okay.

25:40.708 --> 25:41.876
All right.

25:43.944 --> 25:45.679
What do you want?

25:45.713 --> 25:47.248
- Shut up!
- Okay.

25:47.281 --> 25:50.217
Keep your head down
and shut the fuck up, okay?

25:50.251 --> 25:51.218
We don't have money.

25:51.252 --> 25:53.087
I mean, we have a few bucks
here and there.

25:53.120 --> 25:55.122
If you look in the top
left drawer in the office,

25:55.156 --> 25:57.024
- it's just...
- I have money.

25:57.058 --> 25:58.692
I've got 43 bucks
in the wallet...

25:58.726 --> 26:00.127
in the green purse...

26:03.064 --> 26:05.032
Shut up!

26:06.300 --> 26:08.936
You know what,
everyone over here.

26:08.969 --> 26:10.704
Pretty boy, let's go, come on!

26:10.738 --> 26:11.705
- That way.
- Okay.

26:11.739 --> 26:13.207
Quick, everybody!

26:13.240 --> 26:15.076
Over there, come on.

26:16.944 --> 26:19.713
A little faster, come on.

26:19.747 --> 26:21.348
Come on.

26:21.382 --> 26:23.617
Let me see your hands.

26:23.651 --> 26:25.386
Hands!

26:25.419 --> 26:27.721
In the white, hands, okay.

26:27.755 --> 26:29.156
What's in your hand?

26:30.958 --> 26:33.661
- Hands?
- Hands.

26:33.694 --> 26:36.230
What's in your hand?
In the white!

26:36.263 --> 26:37.832
All right, we're good.

26:37.865 --> 26:39.767
Are you good?

26:39.800 --> 26:41.302
Everybody stay down.

26:42.803 --> 26:44.705
And just shut up.

26:44.738 --> 26:46.841
All right,
nobody do anything stupid.

26:46.874 --> 26:48.876
Okay? All good?

26:54.281 --> 26:58.853
You will serve just like
your grandfather and I served.

26:58.886 --> 27:00.154
This is your duty!

27:00.187 --> 27:04.091
Dad, you know I don't believe
in that language of violence.

27:04.125 --> 27:07.094
Don't start again
with that peace and love crap.

27:07.128 --> 27:08.863
I'm not joining the IDF.

27:08.896 --> 27:11.732
I'm not killing people for land.

27:11.765 --> 27:14.802
Your duty is to preserve
your identity,

27:14.835 --> 27:16.270
your heritage!

27:16.303 --> 27:17.304
How?

27:17.338 --> 27:20.107
By erasing others' identities
and heritages?

27:21.942 --> 27:26.046
You are beginning to sound
very American.

27:26.080 --> 27:28.048
You sent me there
to get the best education.

27:28.082 --> 27:30.918
Isn't that what you wanted?

27:30.951 --> 27:34.889
You will join the IDF,
just like all of us.

27:34.922 --> 27:36.757
I won't have blood
on my hands like you.

27:38.492 --> 27:41.028
Then go back to America!

27:49.170 --> 27:52.106
Everybody just stay down

27:52.139 --> 27:54.108
and shut the fuck up.

27:54.141 --> 27:55.142
Okay?

28:18.399 --> 28:20.067
I don't want
to hurt anybody, okay?

28:49.230 --> 28:51.899
I just shot a man,

28:51.932 --> 28:54.101
and I don't want
to shoot anyone else,

28:54.134 --> 28:56.770
so don't... don't push me.

28:59.139 --> 29:01.308
Please, just...

29:01.342 --> 29:02.309
Don't talk to him.

29:04.445 --> 29:07.014
You should listen
to your friend.

29:07.047 --> 29:08.215
He's got his senses back.

29:09.517 --> 29:11.118
He's not my friend.

29:12.353 --> 29:14.255
No?

29:14.288 --> 29:17.124
Hey? Look at me.

29:17.157 --> 29:18.492
Look at me!

29:18.526 --> 29:21.161
Look at me.

29:24.198 --> 29:25.499
Is she your woman?

29:25.533 --> 29:29.303
- Not in a million years.
- Absolutely not.

29:31.338 --> 29:33.807
You jumped to protect her.

29:33.841 --> 29:35.142
I saw it.

29:37.911 --> 29:38.846
I saw it.

29:39.947 --> 29:41.549
It was a reflex.

29:45.085 --> 29:46.887
It looked like more
than a reflex to me.

29:46.920 --> 29:49.156
No, that was a reflex.

29:49.189 --> 29:50.924
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

29:53.227 --> 29:55.429
Did he cheat on you?

29:58.499 --> 30:00.067
Fuck!

30:02.002 --> 30:02.870
Fuck!

30:24.224 --> 30:26.160
Those sons of bitches are fast.

31:02.597 --> 31:05.567
Be quiet. Please, Craig.

31:05.600 --> 31:07.602
Craig, please.

31:10.971 --> 31:13.575
I just wanted to say
I'm sorry for lying to you.

31:13.608 --> 31:15.309
Be quiet.
You're gonna get us killed.

31:15.342 --> 31:17.311
I love you, I really do.

31:17.344 --> 31:18.680
Craig, please.

31:18.713 --> 31:22.349
- Now is not the time.
- It might be the last time.

31:22.383 --> 31:23.984
- You think so?
- I don't know,

31:24.017 --> 31:25.219
but I'm glad I'm here with you.

31:35.429 --> 31:37.665
I'm glad I'm here with you.

31:39.601 --> 31:41.201
Shut the fuck up!

31:43.036 --> 31:45.472
What are you laughing at,
huh, faggot?

31:47.474 --> 31:49.977
Something funny?

32:38.325 --> 32:39.393
Everything's fine.

32:53.106 --> 32:54.475
Stay where you're at.

32:54.509 --> 32:56.076
Stay down.

33:00.080 --> 33:03.551
This is the Los Angeles
Police Department.

33:03.585 --> 33:06.420
My name Mike Gallagher.

33:06.453 --> 33:08.422
The gallery is
completely surrounded.

33:09.456 --> 33:12.192
Just talk to us.

33:12.226 --> 33:13.628
We're here to help.

33:16.396 --> 33:19.266
What's your name?

33:19.299 --> 33:21.468
I'm not telling you
my fucking name.

33:21.503 --> 33:24.806
We had reports
that gunshots were fired.

33:24.839 --> 33:25.673
Is anyone hurt?

33:28.075 --> 33:29.644
Nobody's hurt.

33:29.677 --> 33:31.245
Good, good.

33:32.346 --> 33:34.549
So how can I help?

33:36.383 --> 33:38.520
I don't want your fucking help.

33:43.423 --> 33:46.159
Fucking cops.

33:46.193 --> 33:48.295
I mean, am I right?

33:48.328 --> 33:50.832
Who really likes cops,
am I right?

33:50.865 --> 33:52.800
I don't.

33:52.834 --> 33:54.201
Of course you don't.

33:54.234 --> 33:56.103
They kill Black guys every day.

33:57.237 --> 33:59.139
What's your name, huh?

33:59.172 --> 34:00.575
Dwayne.

34:00.608 --> 34:02.109
Dwayne.

34:03.176 --> 34:04.712
What do you do, Dwayne, huh?

34:04.746 --> 34:06.548
Do you deliver?

34:08.248 --> 34:10.250
I wasn't even
supposed to be here.

34:10.284 --> 34:14.556
I'm just covering
for a coworker who's sick.

34:14.589 --> 34:16.524
This isn't even my area
of delivery.

34:17.491 --> 34:19.126
That sucks.

34:29.737 --> 34:33.240
Please, stop that noise.

34:35.175 --> 34:37.110
You mean this noise?

34:53.427 --> 34:54.596
Steven?

34:56.564 --> 34:58.365
It's not working, Dad.

35:01.301 --> 35:05.105
The doctor said there'd be
good days and bad days.

35:06.874 --> 35:09.376
Steven, did you stop
taking your meds again?

35:11.244 --> 35:15.550
Steven, you've got
to keep taking your meds.

35:15.583 --> 35:18.218
Tomorrow, we'll tell the doctor
to adjust the dosage

35:18.251 --> 35:19.687
when we see him.

35:19.721 --> 35:20.788
Listen to me.

35:20.822 --> 35:22.523
Steven?

35:22.557 --> 35:24.358
I'm sorry, Dad.

35:24.391 --> 35:26.628
No!

35:29.296 --> 35:32.600
Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

35:32.634 --> 35:34.836
Thy kingdom come,
thy will be done

35:34.869 --> 35:37.505
on earth as it is in heaven.

35:37.538 --> 35:40.374
Give us this day
our daily bread,

35:40.407 --> 35:42.577
and forgive us our trespasses

35:42.610 --> 35:44.879
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

35:44.912 --> 35:46.614
And lead us not to temptation

35:46.648 --> 35:48.616
but deliver us from evil.

35:48.650 --> 35:50.183
For thine is the kingdom
and the power

35:50.217 --> 35:51.753
and the glory forever. Amen.

35:51.786 --> 35:53.420
What's your name?

35:54.589 --> 35:55.957
Fiona.

35:59.827 --> 36:01.829
You scared of dying, Fiona?

36:01.863 --> 36:04.264
I'm scared of dying.

36:04.297 --> 36:06.299
I'm scared of living.

36:06.333 --> 36:08.603
I've never left California.

36:11.706 --> 36:13.641
I'm scared of dying, too.

36:14.976 --> 36:17.310
When I served in Afghanistan...

36:22.349 --> 36:23.551
...and Iraq.

36:35.863 --> 36:39.000
I'm betting five in.

36:39.033 --> 36:40.835
Just gonna randomly
throw that king in?

36:40.868 --> 36:42.670
Is that what you're gonna do?
I got you, man.

36:44.438 --> 36:45.540
We're under attack!

36:45.573 --> 36:47.374
Grab your shit,
get the fuck out now!

36:47.407 --> 36:49.342
- Let's go!
- Go, go, go, go!

37:14.035 --> 37:16.904
I saw death

37:16.938 --> 37:20.407
almost every day.

37:20.440 --> 37:22.309
For two years.

37:28.482 --> 37:30.250
Who told you to move?

37:33.988 --> 37:36.490
She's all right.

37:36.524 --> 37:39.426
- Right?
- Mhm.

37:39.459 --> 37:41.028
See?

37:41.062 --> 37:42.864
She's all right.

37:50.838 --> 37:53.040
Mr. Big Shot.

37:57.845 --> 38:00.380
Have you ever been in the war?

38:00.413 --> 38:01.381
Huh?

38:04.085 --> 38:07.420
Have you ever
sacrificed everything

38:07.454 --> 38:08.623
for your country?

38:12.492 --> 38:14.061
See, I thought you hadn't.

38:15.563 --> 38:18.666
Oh, no, I know you, man.

38:20.001 --> 38:22.069
You're the kind of guy

38:22.103 --> 38:24.839
who's always had everything
handed to him.

38:26.941 --> 38:29.877
I work hard
for everything I had.

38:32.547 --> 38:34.749
You have no idea
what my life has been like.

38:36.083 --> 38:38.553
Nothing was handed to me.

38:41.122 --> 38:43.057
But it was all taken away.

38:45.693 --> 38:48.495
She's going after
everything you've got

38:48.529 --> 38:50.898
'cause of this goddamn prenup.

38:50.932 --> 38:52.432
She can have it all.

38:52.465 --> 38:55.903
- I don't care anymore.
- She gets the house,

38:55.937 --> 38:59.472
the cars, the stocks,
everything.

38:59.507 --> 39:00.808
Not everything.

39:00.842 --> 39:04.477
Oh, yes, that's right.

39:04.512 --> 39:08.015
Apparently you stood strong
on your art collection.

39:08.049 --> 39:09.584
That's right.

39:09.617 --> 39:11.719
How much is that worth?

39:11.752 --> 39:13.554
$200,000, right?

39:15.189 --> 39:18.159
Why are you doing this, Ross?

39:18.192 --> 39:20.561
If you let her have
what she's asking for,

39:20.595 --> 39:22.697
you're going to have
nothing left.

39:22.730 --> 39:24.397
Nothing of value.

39:24.431 --> 39:27.134
I already lost
everything that mattered.

39:27.168 --> 39:30.872
You should fight this.

39:30.905 --> 39:32.874
She's the one
who cheated on you.

39:32.907 --> 39:34.709
I'm done fighting.

39:34.742 --> 39:37.745
She's fallen for someone else,
and that's it.

39:37.778 --> 39:39.947
I want to end my marriage.

39:39.981 --> 39:42.750
And you're gonna reward her
by giving her everything

39:42.783 --> 39:44.518
that you've worked hard for.

39:44.552 --> 39:46.621
I can always get new things.

39:46.654 --> 39:48.189
Work harder, make more money.

39:48.222 --> 39:50.423
None of that matters to me.

39:50.457 --> 39:52.093
But I can't live in a house
filled with things

39:52.126 --> 39:54.095
that remind me of her.

39:55.796 --> 39:58.532
You have no idea
what my life has been like.

40:00.500 --> 40:02.904
I worked hard
for everything I had.

40:05.072 --> 40:06.807
But it was all taken back.

40:08.009 --> 40:10.945
How about you shut the fuck up?

40:10.978 --> 40:13.648
Before I put a bullet
in your skull

40:13.681 --> 40:16.617
and make it look
a little more interesting.

40:16.651 --> 40:18.119
Understood?

40:22.023 --> 40:23.557
Fuck.

40:33.601 --> 40:35.002
This guy's a lunatic.

40:36.237 --> 40:37.905
He needs to be stopped.

40:37.939 --> 40:39.140
Are you crazy?

40:40.274 --> 40:41.776
Fuck.

40:43.978 --> 40:45.813
You want to play hero

40:45.846 --> 40:47.782
and get all of us killed
with you.

41:05.866 --> 41:07.268
Have a better plan?

41:07.301 --> 41:11.672
Yeah. I want to stay alive
like everyone else.

41:11.706 --> 41:13.941
Oh, that sounds good.

41:13.975 --> 41:16.877
How are you gonna do that,
exactly?

41:16.911 --> 41:18.946
By keeping quiet.

41:18.980 --> 41:20.848
Perhaps you should do the same.

41:20.881 --> 41:21.916
Hey!

41:23.584 --> 41:27.688
You two crazy lovers

41:27.722 --> 41:29.056
can't spend a minute

41:29.090 --> 41:31.559
not talking to one another,
can you?

41:32.860 --> 41:36.197
Can you?

41:39.600 --> 41:40.868
Is that what's goin' on?

41:40.901 --> 41:42.837
No.

41:42.870 --> 41:43.938
Hey!

41:43.971 --> 41:46.073
What are you doin'?

41:46.107 --> 41:47.908
Are you writing coded
messages to them or somethin'?

41:47.942 --> 41:49.777
- Who?
- You know who.

41:49.810 --> 41:54.248
- The cops!
- No, no, no, no, I swear.

41:54.281 --> 41:56.117
I'm only writing
to calm myself down.

41:56.150 --> 41:58.786
I have panic attacks.

41:58.819 --> 42:00.921
The hell is this?

42:00.955 --> 42:02.690
Grab snacks.

42:02.723 --> 42:04.692
He looks hungry.

42:04.725 --> 42:07.194
Walking back to us.

42:07.228 --> 42:12.833
Looked unsettled and scared.

42:12.867 --> 42:14.802
Two underlines, huh?

42:16.270 --> 42:18.672
How's your anxiety?

42:18.706 --> 42:19.907
Worse.

42:19.940 --> 42:20.808
I can't sleep at night,

42:20.841 --> 42:23.644
and I can't concentrate
during the day.

42:25.846 --> 42:28.582
How's the frequency of your

42:28.616 --> 42:30.651
elevated heart rate?

42:30.684 --> 42:32.753
Only when I'm stressed,
which is all the time now.

42:32.787 --> 42:35.923
I started a new position.

42:35.956 --> 42:37.925
The pay is better,
but the workload is heavier

42:37.958 --> 42:41.128
and more stressful.

42:41.162 --> 42:43.330
I think I need
something stronger.

42:43.364 --> 42:46.233
You're taking the maximum dose.

42:46.267 --> 42:49.670
I can't give you
anymore medication,

42:49.703 --> 42:52.840
but we could try
something else.

42:52.873 --> 42:54.909
- Like what?
- There are a myriad

42:54.942 --> 42:56.677
of coping mechanisms.

42:56.710 --> 42:59.780
Writing can be helpful.

42:59.814 --> 43:01.048
Writing?

43:01.082 --> 43:03.984
That's what I do
at work all day,

43:04.018 --> 43:06.187
writing reviews.

43:06.220 --> 43:10.291
I don't see how writing more
is supposed to help me.

43:10.324 --> 43:14.228
In patients with
a high level of anxiety,

43:14.261 --> 43:17.631
writing everything
that comes to mind

43:17.665 --> 43:22.036
has been proven to be
extremely helpful.

43:22.069 --> 43:23.270
Like a journal?

43:23.304 --> 43:24.472
Not exactly,

43:24.506 --> 43:28.776
just everything and anything
that goes through your mind,

43:28.809 --> 43:33.013
whether it be
about you or others.

43:33.047 --> 43:35.983
Writing helps you
stay focused

43:36.016 --> 43:38.953
and calm.

43:38.986 --> 43:41.122
You really think
it can help me?

43:41.155 --> 43:42.690
I do.

43:46.093 --> 43:49.430
I'm going to refill your

43:49.463 --> 43:52.166
prescription for Xanax...

43:53.734 --> 43:55.436
...and I'll see you
in a month.

43:55.469 --> 43:58.105
Try to do things
that help you relax.

43:58.139 --> 44:00.141
Actually, tomorrow I'm
covering a photo exhibit.

44:00.174 --> 44:03.110
It should be fun!

44:03.144 --> 44:07.148
May I please have it back?

44:07.181 --> 44:08.082
Please?

44:08.115 --> 44:09.850
You want it back?

44:09.884 --> 44:10.818
Please!

44:10.851 --> 44:13.854
This?

44:13.888 --> 44:15.990
Please!

44:16.023 --> 44:18.058
Write this down.

44:18.092 --> 44:20.227
- Fucking write it now!
- Yes.

44:27.034 --> 44:32.106
- Travis is a hero...
- Travis is a hero...

44:32.139 --> 44:34.909
- ...a marine...
- ...a marine...

44:34.942 --> 44:36.944
...who served his country

44:36.977 --> 44:38.846
with the utmost courage.

44:38.879 --> 44:40.881
With the utmost...

44:40.915 --> 44:42.783
- Courage.
- ...courage.

44:45.352 --> 44:48.856
You gotta be kidding me.

44:48.889 --> 44:51.192
Stop fucking calling!

44:54.962 --> 44:57.898
Shots fired.

45:00.901 --> 45:05.005
Okay, look, just
listen to me for a second.

45:05.039 --> 45:06.207
Hello?

45:23.190 --> 45:25.426
Please, please don't kill me!

45:25.459 --> 45:27.761
Please don't kill me!

45:27.795 --> 45:30.532
I'm sorry, I didn't...

45:30.565 --> 45:32.233
I didn't mean to shoot you.

45:32.266 --> 45:34.435
Keep pressure on it, okay?

45:38.005 --> 45:39.873
Are you a doctor?

45:39.907 --> 45:41.775
I was a nurse.

45:41.809 --> 45:44.011
Do you want me to check that?

45:44.044 --> 45:45.346
This?

45:48.550 --> 45:51.785
No, no, no, it's not my blood.

46:01.862 --> 46:04.131
Look, stop calling!

46:04.164 --> 46:07.301
Let me send in some paramedics
if anyone's hurt, okay?

46:07.334 --> 46:10.204
No cops, just paramedics.

46:10.237 --> 46:14.074
We don't need
any paramedics.

46:14.108 --> 46:17.278
Well, then what do you need?

46:17.311 --> 46:18.912
I need to think,

46:18.946 --> 46:20.914
so just stop calling

46:20.948 --> 46:23.317
'cause I can't fucking think

46:23.350 --> 46:24.952
when you're calling

46:24.985 --> 46:27.488
all the time!

46:34.461 --> 46:37.998
I have also
seen death many times.

46:43.103 --> 46:47.041
I understand how you feel.

46:47.074 --> 46:49.376
What the fuck
are you talking ' about?

46:49.410 --> 46:50.878
We're a lot alike.

46:55.282 --> 46:58.620
You have no idea

46:58.653 --> 47:00.421
how I feel.

47:00.454 --> 47:02.256
I lived it

47:02.289 --> 47:05.125
in Lebanon for many years.

47:05.159 --> 47:07.895
I know how you feel.

47:07.928 --> 47:10.164
All the things I've seen.

47:13.635 --> 47:17.539
The things we've done.

47:17.572 --> 47:20.307
All the things we've done.

47:27.649 --> 47:30.117
Where's the next attack?

47:34.254 --> 47:37.391
He says, "I don't know."

47:37.424 --> 47:39.661
Where's the next attack?

47:44.231 --> 47:46.033
He says he doesn't know.

47:56.711 --> 47:58.979
Fuck this, I got a better idea.

47:59.012 --> 48:00.247
Gunnery!

48:00.280 --> 48:01.415
What the fuck are you doin'?

48:01.448 --> 48:03.283
Back off, marine.

48:05.085 --> 48:07.354
Tell him I'm gonna
count to three.

48:07.388 --> 48:08.922
If he doesn't answer
my question by then,

48:08.956 --> 48:11.358
I'm gonna blow
his fuckin' head off.

48:11.392 --> 48:12.627
Tell him!

48:18.065 --> 48:21.669
One...

48:21.703 --> 48:23.638
...two...

48:26.340 --> 48:31.311
Tell him after two comes three,
and he's gonna die.

48:31.345 --> 48:35.482
Just fucking tell him!

48:39.754 --> 48:42.222
Maybe he doesn't know anything.

48:42.256 --> 48:43.223
Fuckin' liar.

48:44.759 --> 48:46.126
What the fuck, man?

48:46.160 --> 48:47.529
You said you
weren't gonna kill him!

48:47.562 --> 48:49.430
You said you were
just gonna mess around!

48:49.463 --> 48:51.031
That was not
your call to make,

48:51.064 --> 48:52.600
and you should not have
made it that way.

48:52.634 --> 48:54.368
What the fuck are you doing?

48:54.401 --> 48:58.172
What the fuck?

49:02.042 --> 49:04.077
We killed him.

49:06.246 --> 49:08.516
We killed him.

49:12.754 --> 49:16.356
It was all okay.

49:16.390 --> 49:18.425
It was all okay.

49:18.459 --> 49:20.695
Do you know why?

49:20.728 --> 49:23.230
No.

49:23.263 --> 49:25.499
'Cause we're the good guys.

49:33.273 --> 49:35.577
After the war,

49:35.610 --> 49:37.377
I felt lost

49:37.411 --> 49:40.414
and angry for a very long time,

49:43.150 --> 49:45.520
but I've learned something.

49:45.553 --> 49:47.555
If you can look
within yourself

49:47.589 --> 49:50.725
and capture that moment of
the person that you were once,

49:50.758 --> 49:53.093
and hold onto it,

49:53.126 --> 49:56.029
I promise you
you can feel peace again.

49:58.332 --> 50:00.100
- Yes.
- It doesn't work that way.

50:00.133 --> 50:01.669
Yes, it does.

50:08.242 --> 50:11.278
I...

50:11.311 --> 50:14.214
I need, I need to figure out

50:14.248 --> 50:16.316
what I'm gonna do

50:16.350 --> 50:19.086
before they come in here.

50:21.388 --> 50:26.426
So, just stay down.

50:26.460 --> 50:29.631
Stay down.

50:35.302 --> 50:37.070
He's not responding.

50:37.104 --> 50:38.773
Not pickin' up.

51:03.698 --> 51:07.569
I shot him.

51:07.602 --> 51:09.637
I think I killed him.

51:12.574 --> 51:14.676
I fuckin' killed him.

51:22.817 --> 51:27.387
I was... I was just
coming home from work.

51:32.660 --> 51:35.495
It was a long day,

51:35.530 --> 51:38.733
and I just wanted
to see my wife.

51:38.766 --> 51:40.702
So glad I finally
found time

51:40.735 --> 51:42.870
- to swing by and see you.
- Yeah, after all these years!

51:42.904 --> 51:47.174
- Too long.
- It has been too long.

51:47.207 --> 51:49.142
Madeline, I'm home.

51:53.180 --> 51:55.917
Hey!

51:55.950 --> 51:57.819
Maybe he's not dead.

51:57.852 --> 52:00.354
Yeah, he might still be alive.

52:00.387 --> 52:03.190
You could claim self defense.

52:03.223 --> 52:05.593
Everybody shut the fuck up!

52:11.331 --> 52:13.467
You don't know.

52:16.838 --> 52:21.208
What, what do you
think he's doing?

52:21.241 --> 52:23.544
He's probably deciding
which one of us to kill first.

52:23.578 --> 52:26.179
I thought I was
the fatalistic one.

52:26.213 --> 52:28.716
You think we can take him
before he fires another shot?

52:28.750 --> 52:31.451
- Are you freakin' nuts?
- What?

52:31.485 --> 52:33.387
I'm hypoglycemic.

52:33.420 --> 52:35.455
If I don't eat soon,
I'm gonna pass out.

52:35.489 --> 52:37.692
I lost a lot of blood.

52:37.725 --> 52:40.394
Take slow,
deep breaths, okay?

52:40.427 --> 52:41.829
Slow.

52:58.311 --> 53:01.214
Ah, shit.

53:01.248 --> 53:03.685
Shit, shit, shit, shit!

53:03.718 --> 53:05.853
Oh, shit!

53:09.691 --> 53:11.926
You think the cops can
see us through those windows?

53:11.959 --> 53:14.294
I hope so, they'll save us.

53:14.327 --> 53:16.329
If they come in,
they'll be guns a-blazing.

53:16.363 --> 53:18.498
We'll all be dead in seconds.

53:19.967 --> 53:21.669
Don't say that, just...

53:21.703 --> 53:23.370
he's traumatized.

53:23.403 --> 53:27.240
It's a worst-case scenario.

53:27.274 --> 53:29.443
They're not gonna
come in here shooting at us.

53:29.476 --> 53:30.978
But you don't know that!

53:31.012 --> 53:33.480
We just have to
keep our heads down.

53:38.019 --> 53:39.921
Everybody up!

53:39.954 --> 53:41.589
Everybody up!

53:41.622 --> 53:44.625
Get the fuck up, now!

53:44.659 --> 53:46.694
Up! Up! Come on!

53:46.728 --> 53:49.396
- Go! Go!
- Okay, get up.

53:49.429 --> 53:52.399
Okay.

53:52.432 --> 53:54.869
Now...

53:54.902 --> 53:57.471
slowly...

53:57.505 --> 53:59.707
put up your hands.

53:59.741 --> 54:00.975
Come on.

54:01.008 --> 54:02.409
Up, up.

54:02.442 --> 54:03.511
Up, up!

54:03.544 --> 54:05.046
There we go.

54:08.381 --> 54:10.283
Nice and slow.

54:12.486 --> 54:15.022
Come towards the windows.

54:15.056 --> 54:16.490
Keep movin'.

54:16.524 --> 54:17.658
Hands up.

54:17.692 --> 54:19.359
Move it!

54:22.830 --> 54:26.067
Nice and easy.

54:26.100 --> 54:29.003
Keep movin'.

54:29.036 --> 54:30.972
Keep on goin'.

54:36.811 --> 54:39.614
Hands up.

54:39.647 --> 54:41.616
Keep it walkin'.

54:43.885 --> 54:45.820
Okay.

54:45.853 --> 54:48.523
Keep your hands up,

54:48.556 --> 54:51.559
and slowly turn around
and face me.

54:54.695 --> 54:58.099
Keep those hands up.

54:58.132 --> 55:00.333
Good.

55:00.367 --> 55:04.337
Now don't move.

55:04.371 --> 55:06.107
Don't move.

55:47.915 --> 55:49.750
Who took these?

55:53.888 --> 55:56.456
Who took these?

55:56.489 --> 55:58.059
I did.

56:10.504 --> 56:12.573
Real nice.

56:23.618 --> 56:25.786
I don't wanna
fuckin' talk to anybody.

56:25.820 --> 56:28.022
Look, we're not goin' anywhere

56:28.055 --> 56:30.658
until we know everybody's safe,

56:30.691 --> 56:33.828
including you.

56:33.861 --> 56:35.863
Let us help you.

56:37.765 --> 56:39.567
I already told you

56:39.600 --> 56:41.669
I don't want your help.

56:41.702 --> 56:43.871
How about if you release
some of the hostages,

56:43.905 --> 56:46.040
and we'll have
some food sent in,

56:46.073 --> 56:49.210
okay?

56:49.243 --> 56:51.579
How many people are in there?

56:51.612 --> 56:54.715
You just don't get it, man.

56:54.749 --> 56:57.551
I'm not sendin'
any of them out there.

56:57.585 --> 56:59.020
What don't I get?

56:59.053 --> 57:01.956
Help me understand!

57:01.989 --> 57:07.595
We can end this peacefully
without anybody getting hurt.

57:07.628 --> 57:11.165
That's fuckin' bullshit,
and you know it!

57:11.198 --> 57:14.135
I see them out there.

57:14.168 --> 57:16.671
I see your snipers.

57:16.704 --> 57:19.807
They've got lasers on me

57:19.840 --> 57:21.509
ready to shoot.

57:21.542 --> 57:23.544
They're not going to shoot.

57:23.577 --> 57:25.680
You have my word.

57:25.713 --> 57:29.583
Your word?

57:29.617 --> 57:33.120
Your word doesn't
mean anything to me.

57:33.154 --> 57:35.488
Well, it's up to you now.

57:35.523 --> 57:38.592
All you have to do
is trust me.

57:41.529 --> 57:43.798
Trust you?

57:43.831 --> 57:46.499
How?

57:46.534 --> 57:48.135
How can I trust you

57:48.169 --> 57:50.671
when I can't even trust myself?

58:04.752 --> 58:07.221
- Are you crazy?
- You'll get us all killed!

58:07.254 --> 58:09.657
Get back.

58:09.690 --> 58:11.726
Please, get back.

58:14.095 --> 58:17.565
Don't worry.

58:17.598 --> 58:20.167
Trust me.

58:23.170 --> 58:24.605
Stand back!

58:27.341 --> 58:30.811
Or I'll put a bullet
in your skull.

58:30.845 --> 58:34.915
- You're not a killer.
- Stand back!

58:34.949 --> 58:37.885
Do it.

58:37.918 --> 58:40.087
Okay.

58:40.121 --> 58:41.856
Look, you haven't
hurt any of us.

58:41.889 --> 58:43.290
I'm hurt!

58:47.962 --> 58:50.297
We can still walk
out of here alive.

58:55.803 --> 58:57.872
You...

58:57.905 --> 59:01.308
you can put an end
to this, okay?

59:05.880 --> 59:07.715
I shot a man...

59:10.217 --> 59:12.853
...and I think I killed him.

59:12.887 --> 59:14.755
He might still be alive.

59:15.990 --> 59:18.125
He was bleedin'.

59:21.996 --> 59:24.365
And Madeline was upset.

59:24.398 --> 59:26.133
I just ran out.

59:26.167 --> 59:28.769
No, no,
he could still be alive.

59:28.803 --> 59:30.237
Look, look, look!

59:30.271 --> 59:33.107
Look, we're all alive.

59:34.775 --> 59:37.611
We, we, we, we can all
walk out of this together.

59:37.645 --> 59:40.247
- Just shut up for a second!
- Okay, okay, okay.

59:40.281 --> 59:42.149
Just shut up.

1:00:32.867 --> 1:00:37.438
It's not... You don't...

1:00:37.471 --> 1:00:41.342
You don't have to do this.

1:00:41.375 --> 1:00:42.743
There's no other way.

1:00:42.776 --> 1:00:45.713
No, no, no, no,
there's a way out.

1:00:45.746 --> 1:00:48.249
There is always,
always a way out!

1:00:48.282 --> 1:00:49.783
- No, there isn't!
- Yes, there is!

1:00:49.817 --> 1:00:52.186
What do you fuckin' know?

1:00:52.219 --> 1:00:54.021
Huh?

1:00:54.054 --> 1:00:56.090
What do you know?

1:00:56.123 --> 1:00:58.926
Oh, I know.

1:00:58.959 --> 1:01:01.095
My wife,

1:01:01.128 --> 1:01:04.131
my wife...

1:01:04.165 --> 1:01:07.801
was shot and killed

1:01:07.835 --> 1:01:10.070
by a 17-year-old.

1:01:12.740 --> 1:01:14.375
So, I understand.

1:01:14.408 --> 1:01:16.243
I understand your pain,

1:01:16.277 --> 1:01:18.279
and I get...

1:01:20.181 --> 1:01:23.417
...how long it hurts.

1:01:23.450 --> 1:01:26.921
And I wanted to find that kid,
and I wanted to kill that kid!

1:01:32.359 --> 1:01:34.962
Why didn't you?

1:01:34.995 --> 1:01:38.232
It wouldn't change anything.

1:01:38.265 --> 1:01:40.501
Wouldn't take away the pain,

1:01:40.535 --> 1:01:42.803
and it wouldn't bring her back.

1:01:45.773 --> 1:01:48.175
There's no comin'
back from this, man.

1:01:50.377 --> 1:01:52.446
Not for people like me.

1:01:52.479 --> 1:01:56.116
That's not true.

1:01:56.150 --> 1:01:59.753
You're a good guy.

1:01:59.787 --> 1:02:01.789
I wanted to be.

1:02:01.822 --> 1:02:03.891
Hey, don't do it.

1:02:03.924 --> 1:02:06.528
Think of Madeline.

1:02:06.561 --> 1:02:09.797
Madeline!

1:02:09.830 --> 1:02:12.800
What did you
sacrifice for them?

1:02:12.833 --> 1:02:14.368
Baby, no!

1:02:21.842 --> 1:02:24.445
Get outta my house,
or I'll fuckin' kill you.

1:02:43.464 --> 1:02:46.534
Tell him after two comes three,
and he's gonna die.

1:02:57.612 --> 1:03:00.281
I'm sorry, Madeline.

1:03:29.209 --> 1:03:31.145
Ms. Morcos,

1:03:31.178 --> 1:03:33.914
how 'bout we talk
about your friend?

1:03:33.947 --> 1:03:35.149
Who, Craig?

1:03:35.182 --> 1:03:39.019
No, Avi Dayhan.

1:03:39.053 --> 1:03:42.423
I don't know him.

1:03:42.456 --> 1:03:46.960
- Mr. Dayhan.
- It's Dahan.

1:03:46.994 --> 1:03:49.229
- Mr. Dahan.
- Thank you.

1:03:49.263 --> 1:03:52.399
Did you have any prior
relationship with anyone there?

1:03:52.433 --> 1:03:56.036
Look, I already
told you what happened.

1:03:56.070 --> 1:03:58.272
From your notebook:

1:03:58.305 --> 1:04:01.375
"Nadia is upset at Avi,
they both argue."

1:04:01.408 --> 1:04:04.612
Cathy, why were Avi
and Nadia arguing?

1:04:04.646 --> 1:04:06.180
I don't remember.

1:04:06.213 --> 1:04:09.983
I was writing notes
to calm myself down.

1:04:10.017 --> 1:04:12.219
My psychiatrist recommended it

1:04:12.252 --> 1:04:15.422
when I get panic attacks.

1:04:15.456 --> 1:04:18.325
There was so much
tension between them.

1:04:18.359 --> 1:04:20.994
Can you be more specific?

1:04:21.028 --> 1:04:24.231
He just seemed to
want her back.

1:04:24.264 --> 1:04:26.200
Oh, and I remember she said,

1:04:26.233 --> 1:04:28.435
"Not in a million years!"

1:04:28.469 --> 1:04:30.471
Are you sure about that, Fiona?

1:04:30.505 --> 1:04:32.439
Absolutely!

1:04:34.174 --> 1:04:37.444
Is Ms. Nadia Morcos
your friend?

1:04:37.478 --> 1:04:38.680
No.

1:04:38.713 --> 1:04:40.447
Have you ever met her?

1:04:40.481 --> 1:04:43.917
She's Lebanese
and I'm Israeli.

1:04:43.951 --> 1:04:46.688
What are the chances
of us meeting?

1:04:46.721 --> 1:04:49.657
You tell us.

1:04:49.691 --> 1:04:53.260
So, all this
display of emotions,

1:04:53.293 --> 1:04:56.330
all that for a man
you met today.

1:04:56.363 --> 1:05:00.267
What can I say, he leaves
quite an impression.

1:05:00.300 --> 1:05:02.469
What time did you get there?

1:05:02.503 --> 1:05:04.572
The first time
or the second time?

1:05:04.606 --> 1:05:06.674
Did you go in twice?

1:05:06.708 --> 1:05:09.309
- Uh, yes.
- Why?

1:05:09.343 --> 1:05:10.645
I was there when
the show started,

1:05:10.678 --> 1:05:13.313
then I left and came back.

1:05:13.347 --> 1:05:14.582
And why did you come back, Nick?

1:05:14.616 --> 1:05:18.152
To support my boyfriend.

1:05:18.185 --> 1:05:20.053
Why, is that a problem?

1:05:29.062 --> 1:05:31.965
How long has your boyfriend
had a drug problem?

1:05:31.999 --> 1:05:33.434
He doesn't!

1:05:37.471 --> 1:05:39.339
I mean,

1:05:39.373 --> 1:05:41.208
not for long.

1:05:46.748 --> 1:05:49.450
I did catch him
doing some today.

1:05:49.483 --> 1:05:53.287
Know anything about this?

1:05:53.320 --> 1:05:56.123
Never seen that before.

1:05:56.156 --> 1:05:58.425
Have you ever
done cocaine, Craig?

1:05:58.459 --> 1:06:01.094
Oh, God, no!

1:06:04.498 --> 1:06:06.500
Shall we do a blood test?

1:06:09.369 --> 1:06:12.439
What were you doing
at 86 Melrose Avenue?

1:06:12.473 --> 1:06:15.008
Delivering a package?

1:06:15.042 --> 1:06:18.746
And what was in the package?

1:06:18.780 --> 1:06:20.347
Why were you at the gallery,

1:06:20.380 --> 1:06:24.384
when the package is
addressed to Mr. Beaumont?

1:06:24.418 --> 1:06:27.120
- What?
- The package is being handled

1:06:27.154 --> 1:06:28.455
by a special
law enforcement unit

1:06:28.489 --> 1:06:31.425
for suspicious content.

1:06:31.458 --> 1:06:35.262
It would help if you tell us
who gave you the package.

1:06:35.295 --> 1:06:36.698
My, my manager did

1:06:36.731 --> 1:06:39.701
like he does every day
when I have packages to deliver.

1:06:43.838 --> 1:06:46.774
Travis has PTSD.

1:06:46.808 --> 1:06:49.042
I thought you said
you didn't know him?

1:06:49.076 --> 1:06:52.212
I know PTSD,
and I can tell that he has it.

1:06:52.246 --> 1:06:54.582
I have it too.

1:06:54.616 --> 1:06:56.416
"Travis is a war hero,

1:06:56.450 --> 1:06:59.419
a marine who served his country
with the utmost courage,

1:06:59.453 --> 1:07:02.256
- a great American."
- He made me write that.

1:07:05.425 --> 1:07:08.663
It was very intense.

1:07:08.696 --> 1:07:11.098
Everyone was panicking.

1:07:11.131 --> 1:07:13.367
Ross, did you know
this guy Travis?

1:07:13.400 --> 1:07:14.368
Oh, no.

1:07:14.401 --> 1:07:19.373
He was some crazy
ex-marine who stormed in.

1:07:19.406 --> 1:07:21.275
How did you know
he was an ex-marine?

1:07:21.308 --> 1:07:22.710
He told us.

1:07:22.744 --> 1:07:25.412
What else did he say?

1:07:25.445 --> 1:07:29.082
He said he killed a man.

1:07:29.116 --> 1:07:30.752
He was very upset.

1:07:32.352 --> 1:07:35.222
Here you go!

1:07:35.255 --> 1:07:37.157
Oh.

1:07:37.190 --> 1:07:38.292
Thank you for these.

1:07:38.325 --> 1:07:39.459
Of course.

1:07:39.493 --> 1:07:40.862
I was getting so dizzy.

1:07:40.895 --> 1:07:43.463
I'm sure.

1:07:43.497 --> 1:07:45.332
So, they spoke a lot

1:07:45.365 --> 1:07:46.734
and argued a lot.

1:07:46.768 --> 1:07:48.536
And that guy
with the gun, Travis,

1:07:48.570 --> 1:07:52.306
he called them
"crazy lovebirds."

1:07:52.339 --> 1:07:53.841
Crazy lovebirds?

1:07:53.875 --> 1:07:55.275
Uh-huh.

1:07:55.309 --> 1:07:56.578
And then Nadia told Travis

1:07:56.611 --> 1:07:59.413
that she and he
had a lot in common.

1:07:59.446 --> 1:08:01.516
- A lot in common?
- Yeah.

1:08:01.549 --> 1:08:05.152
Something about
both being in, um,

1:08:05.185 --> 1:08:06.654
Lebanon.

1:08:10.592 --> 1:08:13.293
Oh, and that other guy,

1:08:13.327 --> 1:08:15.462
he was jealous.

1:08:15.495 --> 1:08:16.898
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

1:08:16.931 --> 1:08:18.131
Hm.

1:08:18.165 --> 1:08:19.734
I don't know her, but...

1:08:19.767 --> 1:08:22.235
but she has talent.

1:08:22.269 --> 1:08:25.205
Very visual.

1:08:25.238 --> 1:08:28.910
She uses her dark past
to express her present life.

1:08:28.943 --> 1:08:30.344
Dark past?

1:08:30.377 --> 1:08:33.313
Growing up in Lebanon
during the war?

1:08:33.347 --> 1:08:35.282
Seems pretty dark to me.

1:08:35.315 --> 1:08:36.684
How about Avi,

1:08:36.718 --> 1:08:38.586
the man with the beard?

1:08:38.620 --> 1:08:40.287
Oh, he's conceited.

1:08:40.320 --> 1:08:43.725
I've seen him before
at other exhibits.

1:08:43.758 --> 1:08:46.293
Seems to come from money.

1:08:46.326 --> 1:08:48.161
Likes to buy art.

1:08:48.195 --> 1:08:49.731
So you're saying that
you and your boyfriend

1:08:49.764 --> 1:08:52.900
didn't know anyone there
except for the photographer?

1:08:52.934 --> 1:08:54.669
Nadia's a friend.

1:08:54.702 --> 1:08:56.470
Cathy and Bill
are art critics,

1:08:56.503 --> 1:08:58.806
we've met before.

1:08:58.840 --> 1:09:01.643
The rest we didn't know.

1:09:01.676 --> 1:09:05.245
Why don't you tell me
about Nadia Morcos.

1:09:05.278 --> 1:09:07.347
I've known her
for over ten years.

1:09:07.381 --> 1:09:08.883
She's such a sweetheart.

1:09:08.916 --> 1:09:11.351
Was she and Mr. Dahan
in a relationship?

1:09:11.385 --> 1:09:12.854
Be serious.

1:09:12.887 --> 1:09:14.522
Travis?

1:09:14.555 --> 1:09:15.857
You're kidding, right?

1:09:15.890 --> 1:09:18.392
Do you even know
Avi or Travis?

1:09:18.425 --> 1:09:19.359
No.

1:09:19.393 --> 1:09:22.530
Guys with beards are
definitely not my type.

1:09:22.563 --> 1:09:24.966
The other one is a homophobe.

1:09:24.999 --> 1:09:26.634
He called me a faggot.

1:09:26.668 --> 1:09:28.903
You really want that blood test!

1:09:28.936 --> 1:09:31.973
I'm telling you the truth!

1:09:32.006 --> 1:09:34.976
Care to know what
was in the package?

1:09:35.009 --> 1:09:36.811
I was just covering
for a coworker who's sick.

1:09:36.844 --> 1:09:39.947
Batteries,
batteries with wires.

1:09:39.981 --> 1:09:43.450
Batteries for a toy car
for Mr. Beaumont's son.

1:09:43.483 --> 1:09:47.522
Mr. Beaumont is at
68 Melrose Avenue.

1:09:55.830 --> 1:09:59.834
Which means that you...

1:09:59.867 --> 1:10:02.737
were at the wrong address.

1:10:12.714 --> 1:10:16.017
She said that you had left
quite an impression on her.

1:10:16.050 --> 1:10:17.018
Really?

1:10:17.051 --> 1:10:21.856
Mr. Dahan, are you
and Ms. Morcos neighbors?

1:10:21.889 --> 1:10:23.658
You could say that.

1:10:23.691 --> 1:10:26.493
You guys live on
opposite sides of the city.

1:10:26.527 --> 1:10:30.698
Tell us, what
makes you neighbors?

1:10:30.732 --> 1:10:33.366
That's a question
you'd have to ask God.

1:10:50.718 --> 1:10:52.486
Anything else you care to add?

1:10:55.089 --> 1:10:59.894
Look, I've had a long day
and I'm really tired.

1:11:02.697 --> 1:11:04.464
Why don't you ask Travis,
he's gonna tell you

1:11:04.498 --> 1:11:06.601
everything that
you need to know.

1:11:10.037 --> 1:11:12.039
He's dead.

1:11:12.073 --> 1:11:14.776
What?

1:11:14.809 --> 1:11:16.611
He wasn't gonna hurt anyone.

1:11:16.644 --> 1:11:20.413
He was in pain, he witnessed
the violence of war.

1:11:23.350 --> 1:11:25.686
You didn't have to shoot him.

1:11:25.720 --> 1:11:27.522
He shot himself.

1:11:37.732 --> 1:11:40.034
Am I under arrest,
or can I go?

1:12:06.160 --> 1:12:07.829
Hey,

1:12:07.862 --> 1:12:10.665
how was it?

1:12:10.698 --> 1:12:13.000
They tried really hard
to connect us.

1:12:13.034 --> 1:12:14.969
Us?

1:12:15.002 --> 1:12:17.772
Us is a word that will
never connect you and me.

1:12:17.805 --> 1:12:22.442
My ride is here,
can I give you a lift?

1:12:22.475 --> 1:12:25.046
Hey, neighbor, am I gonna
ever see you again?

1:12:25.079 --> 1:12:26.881
Maybe!

1:12:26.914 --> 1:12:28.649
In the afterlife.

1:12:28.683 --> 1:12:30.383
I hope so!

1:12:30.417 --> 1:12:31.752
Maybe then we can
have some peace,

1:12:31.786 --> 1:12:33.754
even for a moment!

1:12:40.595 --> 1:12:41.796
Hello, sir.

1:12:41.829 --> 1:12:42.830
Hello, David.

1:12:42.864 --> 1:12:44.431
Straight home, Mr. Dahan?

1:12:44.464 --> 1:12:45.700
Yes, please.

1:12:48.035 --> 1:12:50.938
Friend of yours, sir?

1:12:53.040 --> 1:12:54.575
Neighbor.

1:13:59.674 --> 1:14:00.808
Come in.

1:14:03.244 --> 1:14:04.912
What's this?

1:14:04.946 --> 1:14:06.881
It's my letter
of resignation.

1:14:06.914 --> 1:14:07.882
What?

1:14:07.915 --> 1:14:09.817
I almost died last week.

1:14:09.850 --> 1:14:13.587
I wanna travel and discover
new places before I die.

1:14:16.691 --> 1:14:19.093
Life is so unpredictable.

1:14:29.136 --> 1:14:31.072
Feeling yourself

1:14:31.105 --> 1:14:34.508
relaxing into the support

1:14:34.542 --> 1:14:37.044
behind and...

1:14:43.884 --> 1:14:45.086
This is Cathy.

1:14:45.119 --> 1:14:47.054
Need you at
the gallery by 7:00.

1:14:47.088 --> 1:14:49.023
Sure, I'm on it.

1:14:49.056 --> 1:14:50.925
Good to have you back.

1:14:59.300 --> 1:15:03.037
Close your eyes
and let go.

1:15:03.070 --> 1:15:07.074
Feel the lightness
of your body.

1:15:18.753 --> 1:15:20.121
My name is Bill.

1:15:20.154 --> 1:15:22.256
Hi, Bill.

1:15:22.289 --> 1:15:25.559
My son,

1:15:25.593 --> 1:15:28.295
Steven,

1:15:28.329 --> 1:15:31.699
shot himself

1:15:31.732 --> 1:15:33.667
six months ago.

1:15:36.203 --> 1:15:38.739
I haven't been able to grieve

1:15:38.773 --> 1:15:43.644
or talk about it since.

1:16:26.921 --> 1:16:28.222
Hi!

1:16:28.255 --> 1:16:29.256
I'm Ross.

1:16:29.290 --> 1:16:31.292
Tina.

1:16:31.325 --> 1:16:34.795
You're much more beautiful
than your profile pictures.

1:16:34.829 --> 1:16:36.363
Oh, thank you.

1:16:36.397 --> 1:16:37.364
Can I get you a beer?

1:16:37.398 --> 1:16:39.100
- Yes, please.
- Great!

1:16:39.133 --> 1:16:43.337
Uh, bartender,
two beers, please.

1:16:43.370 --> 1:16:45.639
Sorry, traffic.

1:16:45.673 --> 1:16:47.007
I understand.

1:17:02.690 --> 1:17:04.992
Sorry I'm late.

1:17:05.025 --> 1:17:06.160
Are you kidding?

1:17:06.193 --> 1:17:09.763
You are always late.

1:17:09.797 --> 1:17:11.332
Don't you look happy!

1:17:11.365 --> 1:17:14.201
Yes, well, I have a little
something to celebrate.

1:17:14.235 --> 1:17:16.971
Are you and Nick
finally getting married?

1:17:17.004 --> 1:17:18.939
Nick and I have separated,

1:17:18.973 --> 1:17:20.441
but we're still
business partners.

1:17:20.474 --> 1:17:22.376
I'm so sorry, Craig.

1:17:22.409 --> 1:17:24.411
We still love each other,

1:17:24.445 --> 1:17:27.915
but I guess love's not enough.

1:17:27.948 --> 1:17:29.984
However, that's not
the reason I'm here.

1:17:30.017 --> 1:17:31.218
You know your little exhibit,

1:17:31.252 --> 1:17:33.687
the one I nagged you
incessantly to do?

1:17:33.721 --> 1:17:36.790
How could I forget?

1:17:36.824 --> 1:17:39.193
We have a buyer.

1:17:39.226 --> 1:17:40.928
Are you serious?

1:17:44.198 --> 1:17:46.267
What piece got bought?

1:17:46.300 --> 1:17:48.369
All the pieces
that survived the bullets.

1:17:48.402 --> 1:17:50.070
I'm sorry,
didn't I mention that?

1:17:50.104 --> 1:17:51.972
- You're joking!
- I'm not.

1:17:52.006 --> 1:17:54.008
If this is a joke, Craig,
it ain't funny.

1:17:54.041 --> 1:17:56.076
No joke,
you're a sensation

1:17:56.110 --> 1:17:58.112
thanks to me, of course.

1:17:58.145 --> 1:18:01.882
Now you're off to
a new successful career.

1:18:01.916 --> 1:18:03.017
Wait a minute,
you're saying people bought

1:18:03.050 --> 1:18:04.985
every single piece
that survived?

1:18:05.019 --> 1:18:07.121
Not people, one person,

1:18:07.154 --> 1:18:09.456
and apparently he's
quite a fan of yours.

1:18:09.490 --> 1:18:10.724
Fan?

1:18:10.758 --> 1:18:13.427
A fan by the name
of Avi Dahan.

1:18:13.460 --> 1:18:16.230
The Israeli?

1:18:16.263 --> 1:18:19.266
Oh, before I forget,

1:18:19.300 --> 1:18:21.135
this also came for you.

1:18:30.044 --> 1:18:32.446
You gonna go?

1:19:01.242 --> 1:19:03.777
You deserve a fresh start.

1:19:06.380 --> 1:19:09.883
This is gonna be
a new chapter.

1:19:36.544 --> 1:19:38.412
- Thank you, Paul.
- Anything else, Mr. Dahan?

1:19:38.445 --> 1:19:40.582
I'm good for now, thank you.

1:20:12.514 --> 1:20:15.316
- Oh, sorry!
- Oh!

1:20:15.349 --> 1:20:18.352
Sorry I'm late.

1:20:18.385 --> 1:20:20.154
Better late than never.

1:20:22.489 --> 1:20:25.059
- Hi.
