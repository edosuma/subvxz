WEBVTT

00:05.772 --> 00:08.540
Another win for Remi,

00:08.576 --> 00:12.046
which means one more
chore for Roman.

00:14.314 --> 00:16.881
You're never gonna
beat your sister

00:16.917 --> 00:17.948
if you keep
playing like that.

00:17.984 --> 00:19.049
I'm trying!

00:19.085 --> 00:22.753
Well, try harder.

00:22.789 --> 00:26.727
Now, let's see
who's doing laundry.

00:28.000 --> 00:34.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:03.364 --> 01:05.363
Yes! I won!
I did it, I beat her!

01:05.399 --> 01:08.198
No. You didn't.

01:08.234 --> 01:09.834
Remi threw the game.

01:09.870 --> 01:12.936
Oh, you think
you did him a favor?

01:12.972 --> 01:15.673
Then why don't you do him
a few more.

01:15.709 --> 01:17.745
No! That isn't fair!

01:18.879 --> 01:20.111
And you're not to help her

01:20.147 --> 01:21.879
do any of these,
do you understand?

01:21.915 --> 01:23.947
Your sister thinks
you're weak,

01:23.983 --> 01:25.950
that you need help.

01:25.986 --> 01:27.852
So, let her help you.

01:27.888 --> 01:31.822
I want these all done by
the end of the day.

01:31.858 --> 01:34.257
I know why you keep losing.

01:34.293 --> 01:36.361
You're only thinking
about your next move.

01:36.397 --> 01:38.295
You've got to think about
what I'm going to do next, too.

01:38.331 --> 01:40.298
Mom says you're my opponent.

01:40.334 --> 01:42.165
Why do you want me
to get better?

01:42.201 --> 01:43.735
The game's more fun
when your enemy's

01:43.771 --> 01:45.772
as good as you are.

01:54.347 --> 01:57.814
Wow, you two do not look
like your best selves.

01:57.850 --> 01:59.650
We've been interrogating
a murderer all night.

01:59.686 --> 02:00.751
Please tell me Lynnette
gave you something

02:00.787 --> 02:01.885
that'll help us find Crawford.

02:01.921 --> 02:03.186
Nothing.
She's stonewalling.

02:03.222 --> 02:05.322
She won't even admit
that she works for him.

02:05.358 --> 02:07.025
Our only lead is that
Crawford made Lynnette steal

02:07.061 --> 02:08.758
all the security codes
from Franklin-Dorfman?

02:08.794 --> 02:10.328
Yeah, which are
only good for 24 hours.

02:10.364 --> 02:11.895
He has to be using them today...

02:11.931 --> 02:13.698
we just don't know what for.

02:13.734 --> 02:16.768
Franklin-Dorfman provides
high-end security

02:16.804 --> 02:20.371
at 117 buildings in
New York and New Jersey.

02:20.407 --> 02:21.972
Private schools,
corporate offices,

02:22.008 --> 02:23.707
and my personal favorite,
a warehouse

02:23.743 --> 02:26.076
full of Lucite
animal sculptures.

02:26.112 --> 02:27.778
We can't seem to find
a single connection

02:27.814 --> 02:30.114
between Crawford
and any of these buildings.

02:30.150 --> 02:31.382
One of them could be a tattoo,

02:31.418 --> 02:32.917
but we can't say for sure

02:32.953 --> 02:34.318
because Roman is still
flooding the databases.

02:34.354 --> 02:35.819
Crawford is safely in hiding.

02:35.855 --> 02:37.320
If he's willing
to risk exposure

02:37.356 --> 02:39.857
to breach one or more
of these places,

02:39.893 --> 02:41.825
this has to be something big.

02:41.861 --> 02:43.461
We really have to work out
what the hell he's up to.

02:43.497 --> 02:45.729
Okay, well, we're still scouring
Lynnette's laptop for clues.

02:45.765 --> 02:47.134
Okay.
Get back to it.

02:52.872 --> 02:54.472
No, it's getting worse,
yeah.

02:54.508 --> 02:55.972
It's not just
the headaches now.

02:56.008 --> 03:00.211
There's, um, this sharp,
uh, buzzing and, um,

03:00.247 --> 03:02.246
I'm starting to see things.

03:02.282 --> 03:03.847
Sure you have enough guns?

03:05.051 --> 03:06.349
It's not gonna work,

03:06.385 --> 03:08.385
because I'm not really here.

03:08.421 --> 03:10.822
I'm trying not to
lose hope, but...

03:10.858 --> 03:13.758
I know, I know.
I just, um,

03:13.794 --> 03:16.093
wish things
could have been different.

03:16.129 --> 03:18.429
Uh, we could have just
been a family.

03:18.465 --> 03:20.902
I know, we're out of time.

03:23.402 --> 03:24.968
The first half is done.

03:25.004 --> 03:26.774
They're on their way
to Little Sky now.

03:31.411 --> 03:33.877
- You made it.
- I'm so sorry.

03:33.913 --> 03:35.750
Lunch went long.

03:36.817 --> 03:38.115
Is everything okay?

03:38.151 --> 03:39.449
Yeah, fine.

03:39.485 --> 03:41.284
Blake Crawford, welcome.

03:41.320 --> 03:44.421
- I'm Edmund, Hotel Manager.
- Oh, very nice to meet you.

03:44.457 --> 03:46.389
This is Tom Jakeman,
head of security

03:46.425 --> 03:48.793
- for my father's company.
- It is unfortunate

03:48.829 --> 03:50.394
that your father
couldn't make it himself.

03:50.430 --> 03:52.028
Oh, he had other
business to attend to.

03:52.064 --> 03:55.032
But, well, he trusts me
with all preparations.

03:55.068 --> 03:56.433
Well, I'm sure
you will both be pleased

03:56.469 --> 03:58.401
to see our selection of
beautiful spaces.

03:58.437 --> 04:00.403
Yeah, I'll need a full tour of
the hotel's security measures

04:00.439 --> 04:03.176
before we see any event space,
beautiful or otherwise.

04:04.578 --> 04:06.544
We've had some issues
in the past.

04:06.580 --> 04:08.211
We would just...
We'd love to know

04:08.247 --> 04:09.546
what safeguards
you have in place.

04:09.582 --> 04:12.120
Of course.
Please, follow me.

04:20.526 --> 04:21.962
Hey.

04:22.995 --> 04:24.097
Hey.

04:28.334 --> 04:31.072
Look, I'm sorry about
yesterday. I was a jerk.

04:32.538 --> 04:35.475
I should have kept
my mouth shut around Meg.

04:37.076 --> 04:39.110
Patterson told me
you guys split up.

04:39.146 --> 04:40.911
That had nothing
to do with you.

04:40.947 --> 04:42.180
- Meg and I had our own issues.
- Yeah, but if I hadn't...

04:42.216 --> 04:44.048
It wouldn't have
made a difference.

04:44.084 --> 04:46.918
Your feelings
weren't the problem.

04:46.954 --> 04:50.922
Are you telling me that you have
never had feelings for Tasha?

04:50.958 --> 04:54.057
We couldn't make it work.

04:54.093 --> 04:55.959
Okay.

04:55.995 --> 04:59.596
I'm sorry...
for both of you.

04:59.632 --> 05:02.199
I really liked Meg.

05:02.235 --> 05:05.101
Thanks. Me, too.

05:05.137 --> 05:06.536
Friends?

05:06.572 --> 05:10.074
Well, I'm never gonna ask you
to be my best man again,

05:10.110 --> 05:11.509
but, yeah, we're cool.

05:11.545 --> 05:13.844
That seems fair.

05:13.880 --> 05:16.980
Ah! Here you guys are.
Been looking around forever.

05:17.016 --> 05:18.481
- We were with you two minutes ago.
- Yeah, well,

05:18.517 --> 05:20.218
time is a flat circle
and I have ADHD.

05:20.254 --> 05:22.290
We got a hit on
the security codes. Come on.

05:26.894 --> 05:28.559
Are you sure you should
be back here already?

05:28.595 --> 05:30.026
You just got shot yesterday.

05:30.062 --> 05:31.528
Oh, my arm's fine.
I just...

05:31.564 --> 05:33.997
I just get these headaches
from not sleeping.

05:34.033 --> 05:35.600
As soon as we take down
Roman and Crawford,

05:35.636 --> 05:37.935
I'm probably gonna hibernate
for like a year.

05:40.574 --> 05:42.540
- What have you got?
- Uh, okay.

05:42.576 --> 05:43.574
So, one of the buildings

05:43.610 --> 05:45.175
using Franklin-Dorfman
security

05:45.211 --> 05:47.944
just got broken into.
Farm Fresh Solvents...

05:47.980 --> 05:49.947
it's a factory
that manufactures

05:49.983 --> 05:53.584
industrial cleaning
products for dairy farms.

05:53.620 --> 05:55.286
So, the heist
would have two parts.

05:55.322 --> 05:57.588
First, we hit the Farm Fresh
Solvents factory here.

05:57.624 --> 06:01.024
They store huge quantities
of dinitrogen tetroxide.

06:01.060 --> 06:03.560
- Part two is getting the reactant...
- All right.

06:03.596 --> 06:05.329
Thank you, Roman.
I've heard enough.

06:05.365 --> 06:07.298
It's too complicated.

06:07.334 --> 06:09.466
I've already reached out
to a local gang

06:09.502 --> 06:10.901
that traffics explosives.

06:10.937 --> 06:12.903
The Viper Kings,

06:12.939 --> 06:14.572
they can get us
all the HMX we need.

06:14.608 --> 06:17.110
Stick to what you're good at
and leave the planning to me.

06:23.016 --> 06:24.081
Aah!

06:27.487 --> 06:30.988
- Your plan is good.
- So tell Shepherd that.

06:31.024 --> 06:34.125
Her plan is better
for what we need right now.

06:34.161 --> 06:35.927
But who knows what we're
gonna need in the future,

06:35.963 --> 06:37.999
so don't be so quick
to throw this away.

06:39.232 --> 06:42.333
This is Roman.

06:42.369 --> 06:44.367
It's a plot he devised to steal
explosives from Sandstorm.

06:44.403 --> 06:46.103
This is the first half of it.

06:46.139 --> 06:48.072
What? So Roman
stole explosives

06:48.108 --> 06:49.473
from this factory
for Crawford?

06:49.509 --> 06:54.377
Well, at least the first part
of an explosive. Uh...

06:54.413 --> 06:57.113
Dinitrogen tetroxide?

06:57.149 --> 07:00.084
Innocuous enough
on its own, stable...

07:00.120 --> 07:01.651
Yeah, unless
the second part is...

07:01.687 --> 07:04.221
- Monomethylhydrazine.
- Monomethylhydrazine.

07:04.257 --> 07:06.690
Okay, Wonder Twins,
you want to fill us in?

07:06.726 --> 07:08.625
Roman and Crawford are
building a hypergolic bomb.

07:08.661 --> 07:12.096
It doesn't require a charge,
just two chemicals that explode

07:12.132 --> 07:13.630
when they come into
contact with each other.

07:13.666 --> 07:15.231
A bomb with no charge.
It sounds like a good way

07:15.267 --> 07:16.634
to smuggle something in
undetected.

07:16.670 --> 07:18.134
And Farm Fresh
happens to have

07:18.170 --> 07:20.237
a very impressive amount
of dinitrogen tetroxide.

07:20.273 --> 07:22.105
There's no
reason to steal that much

07:22.141 --> 07:23.641
unless you're trying to level
a massive target

07:23.677 --> 07:25.242
or multiple targets.

07:25.278 --> 07:26.644
If you're right about this,
that means that Crawford

07:26.680 --> 07:29.146
is planning a mass bombing
on US soil.

07:29.182 --> 07:30.548
It's not exactly his MO.

07:30.584 --> 07:32.649
I mean, he doesn't have
a problem with violence,

07:32.685 --> 07:34.552
but it's usually
a means to an end.

07:34.588 --> 07:36.153
So, what does he
stand to profit

07:36.189 --> 07:37.988
from a terrorist attack
on his own country?

07:38.024 --> 07:39.290
Still nothing from
Lynnette's laptop?

07:39.326 --> 07:40.658
She's not exactly
labelling her files

07:40.694 --> 07:42.560
massive-attack-plans
- dot-p-d-f, so...

07:42.596 --> 07:44.528
You said Roman
is planning to steal

07:44.564 --> 07:46.430
the second part too,
right? The MMH?

07:46.466 --> 07:49.033
If we can figure out
where he's stealing it from,

07:49.069 --> 07:50.334
we could head him off.

07:50.370 --> 07:52.069
I didn't get a good look
at his schematics.

07:52.105 --> 07:53.670
I don't know
the second location,

07:53.706 --> 07:57.644
but, uh, there's one person
who might.

08:08.321 --> 08:10.286
Hello, Kurt.

08:15.255 --> 08:20.255
Subtitles by explosiveskull

08:22.406 --> 08:26.790
This field trip
was a nice surprise.

08:26.826 --> 08:28.190
What's the occasion?

08:28.226 --> 08:29.895
We need to ask you
some questions.

08:32.130 --> 08:33.765
Marriage advice?

08:38.169 --> 08:40.001
So, who's the lucky lady?

08:40.038 --> 08:41.337
It couldn't be my Remi,
could it?

08:41.373 --> 08:43.071
It's not Remi.

08:43.107 --> 08:48.844
Oh, I see. Jane.

08:48.880 --> 08:52.348
I guess I missed my
calling as a matchmaker.

08:52.384 --> 08:57.987
Jane Doe was tailor-made
for you, Kurt... by me.

08:58.023 --> 09:01.427
Where would Roman go to steal
a chemical called MMH?

09:02.894 --> 09:04.898
That old plan?

09:06.231 --> 09:07.997
He must be
getting desperate.

09:08.033 --> 09:10.132
You know,
if he's not careful,

09:10.168 --> 09:11.467
people might get hurt.

09:11.503 --> 09:12.569
Do you know where
he's going or not?

09:12.605 --> 09:14.374
Of course I know.

09:18.210 --> 09:19.541
Get me Jane.

09:19.577 --> 09:24.881
I'll reveal the location,
but only to her.

09:24.917 --> 09:26.315
That is not gonna happen.

09:26.351 --> 09:28.221
You never change, Kurt.

09:31.490 --> 09:35.624
You've always had that
protective streak in you,

09:35.660 --> 09:38.530
ever since
you were a little kid.

09:40.599 --> 09:42.602
- It's a waste of time.
- Wait!

09:46.639 --> 09:49.609
I'll tell you.
I'll tell you, I swear.

09:51.110 --> 09:53.145
I just need to speak
to my daughter.

09:55.380 --> 09:57.313
We can't just give
Shepherd what she wants!

09:57.349 --> 09:58.982
Do you know the hoops
I had to jump through

09:59.018 --> 10:01.316
to get her in here?
I got you access to Shepherd

10:01.352 --> 10:03.585
so we could catch Crawford.
We're not giving up because

10:03.621 --> 10:04.988
Jane's feelings
might get hurt.

10:05.024 --> 10:06.656
No one is giving up.
There are other ways

10:06.692 --> 10:08.056
to get information
out of her.

10:08.092 --> 10:09.592
Isn't that a CIA specialty?

10:09.628 --> 10:12.628
She resisted all enhanced
interrogation techniques.

10:12.664 --> 10:13.966
I'll do it.

10:15.634 --> 10:17.103
Jane, are you sure?

10:20.239 --> 10:23.071
You know that she's gonna
try to manipulate you.

10:23.107 --> 10:24.507
That's what she does.

10:24.543 --> 10:26.541
Lives are on the line.

10:26.577 --> 10:29.078
We have to stop Roman
and Crawford's attack.

10:29.114 --> 10:31.281
I can handle
my mother's mind games.

10:31.317 --> 10:34.550
A few months ago,
this was all I wanted,

10:34.586 --> 10:37.085
to confront her,

10:37.121 --> 10:39.656
ask her why she stole
Avery from me.

10:39.692 --> 10:41.357
But now that I'm here, I...

10:41.393 --> 10:43.526
I don't want
anything from her.

10:43.562 --> 10:46.899
This will be the last time
I ask my mother for anything.

10:52.270 --> 10:54.206
So, how...

10:56.341 --> 10:57.674
Are you well?

10:57.710 --> 11:00.676
You wanted to talk.

11:00.712 --> 11:02.411
Talk.

11:04.416 --> 11:06.983
I wanted to tell you
I'm sorry.

11:07.019 --> 11:11.521
I'm sorry for trying to tear
you and Roman apart.

11:11.557 --> 11:14.324
Of all the things I've done,

11:14.360 --> 11:16.962
it's my biggest regret.

11:18.297 --> 11:21.033
I pitted you two
against each other.

11:23.168 --> 11:27.307
When I rescued you from
that horrible orphanage...

11:28.740 --> 11:31.273
you two were inseparable.

11:31.309 --> 11:34.676
I wanted you to love me as
much as you loved each other,

11:34.712 --> 11:40.550
but your bond with Roman
is unique.

11:40.586 --> 11:44.186
It's... it's deep,
it's strange,

11:44.222 --> 11:46.555
and I didn't understand it.

11:46.591 --> 11:50.196
Roman needed you.
That much, I knew.

11:52.331 --> 11:55.198
He was never meant
to be on his own.

11:55.234 --> 11:57.699
It's in his DNA.

11:57.735 --> 12:01.204
My mistake was with you.

12:01.240 --> 12:06.479
What I couldn't see
was how much you needed him.

12:07.779 --> 12:10.313
I tore you apart.

12:10.349 --> 12:13.782
My... my two children
are trying to kill each other.

12:13.818 --> 12:16.118
It's all my fault.

12:16.154 --> 12:18.091
Remi...

12:19.792 --> 12:21.223
Jane...

12:21.259 --> 12:24.127
don't make
the same mistake I did.

12:24.163 --> 12:27.133
Don't destroy
the thing you love.

12:28.700 --> 12:31.800
See, you don't know it now,

12:31.836 --> 12:34.673
but you need him.

12:35.807 --> 12:38.141
If he dies,

12:38.177 --> 12:39.579
you die with him.

12:42.413 --> 12:46.782
I want you to take
a good long look at me,

12:46.818 --> 12:48.383
because this is the last time

12:48.419 --> 12:51.154
you'll ever see either
of your children again.

12:51.190 --> 12:53.656
It's none of your concern
what happens to us now.

12:53.692 --> 12:56.592
You lost that privilege when
you stole our childhoods,

12:56.628 --> 12:59.829
not to mention my child.

12:59.865 --> 13:01.464
I heard you out.

13:01.500 --> 13:02.732
Now, you tell me

13:02.768 --> 13:06.605
where Roman
is stealing the MMH.

13:09.107 --> 13:10.540
Little Sky.

13:10.576 --> 13:14.477
He's going to Little Sky.

13:14.513 --> 13:16.545
Little Sky Storage
is a military subcontractor

13:16.581 --> 13:19.415
that specializes in the
storage of hazardous materials.

13:19.451 --> 13:21.084
- They're just outside of Poughkeepsie.
- I'll have the field office

13:21.120 --> 13:22.484
up there
send tac teams in now.

13:22.520 --> 13:24.222
We'll meet them up there.

13:26.457 --> 13:28.424
Our security
is top of the line.

13:28.460 --> 13:30.693
Real-time cameras
on a closed-circuit,

13:30.729 --> 13:33.329
strict keycard access,
and all of our guards

13:33.365 --> 13:35.330
come from the most
respected agencies.

13:35.366 --> 13:36.833
I'll need to see
the Presidential Suite

13:36.869 --> 13:38.834
where Ms. Crawford will be
staying during the event.

13:38.870 --> 13:40.837
Yes, unfortunately,
the Presidential

13:40.873 --> 13:43.606
- is unavailable for viewing.
- I can't assess the security

13:43.642 --> 13:45.340
of a room I can't see,
Edmund, and I will not

13:45.376 --> 13:47.109
put Blake's life at risk
because of your incompetence.

13:47.145 --> 13:48.146
Tom!

13:50.349 --> 13:55.318
I apologize for
Mr. Jakeman's short fuse.

13:55.354 --> 13:57.520
My father places
a great deal of trust in him,

13:57.556 --> 13:59.354
which, as you can imagine,
also places him

13:59.390 --> 14:01.189
under a great deal
of pressure.

14:01.225 --> 14:03.391
Of course. But I'm afraid
it's out of my hands.

14:05.364 --> 14:08.196
This charity ball is one of
the biggest events of the year.

14:08.232 --> 14:10.398
Many influential people
will be in attendance,

14:10.434 --> 14:12.767
and they will be entrusting us
with their security.

14:12.803 --> 14:15.204
- I understand that.
- Then please also understand

14:15.240 --> 14:16.872
that unless every one
of Tom's requests can be met,

14:16.908 --> 14:19.742
I cannot, in good conscience,
hold this ball at your hotel,

14:19.778 --> 14:22.344
nor can I recommend to any of my
clients or business associates

14:22.380 --> 14:24.412
to use your venue
in the future.

14:24.448 --> 14:26.882
Word travels quickly in my
circles, and I would hate

14:26.918 --> 14:29.151
for Hotel Cerulean
to develop a reputation

14:29.187 --> 14:30.456
that it didn't need to.

14:31.822 --> 14:33.890
Well, let me see
what I can do.

14:33.926 --> 14:35.728
Thank you.

14:38.429 --> 14:40.228
You okay?

14:40.264 --> 14:42.497
I'm fine. It's just...

14:42.533 --> 14:45.901
the last time I had a chance
to take Roman down,

14:45.937 --> 14:47.306
my gun jammed.

14:52.476 --> 14:53.910
Good to know.

14:53.946 --> 14:56.646
And you took the shot.
That's all that counts.

14:56.682 --> 14:59.247
Guns jam.
It happens, Jane.

14:59.283 --> 15:00.782
I didn't purposely
sabotage it,

15:00.818 --> 15:05.521
but what if I subconsciously
loosened my grip

15:05.557 --> 15:08.790
and that caused the jam?
Maybe part of me is afraid

15:08.826 --> 15:11.794
of what's gonna happen to me
after he's gone.

15:11.830 --> 15:13.662
- What do you mean?
- Even after

15:13.698 --> 15:16.799
all the horrible things
Roman's done,

15:16.835 --> 15:18.401
Shepherd's right.

15:18.437 --> 15:20.869
There's a bond between us
I can't shake.

15:20.905 --> 15:23.271
I don't remember
most of our life together,

15:23.307 --> 15:26.409
but I can feel it.

15:26.445 --> 15:29.344
What if a piece of me
dies with him?

15:29.380 --> 15:32.217
I think that's
how it always feels

15:32.253 --> 15:33.815
when you lose someone
that you've loved.

15:33.851 --> 15:38.286
Now, this idea that
Shepherd has put in your head,

15:38.322 --> 15:40.289
that you can't live
in a world without Roman,

15:40.325 --> 15:42.728
it's just not true, Jane.

15:47.599 --> 15:49.632
Patterson wants us
back in the lab.

15:49.668 --> 15:51.937
Come on.

15:53.038 --> 15:54.303
Why are we still here?

15:54.339 --> 15:55.570
We should be on the road.

15:55.606 --> 15:57.707
- We're too late.
- What do you mean?

15:57.743 --> 15:59.709
Local field teams just arrived
at Little Sky.

15:59.745 --> 16:02.310
All the guards are dead, and
Roman got away with their MMH.

16:02.346 --> 16:03.512
He and Roman have enough

16:03.548 --> 16:04.880
to take out
a full city block.

16:04.916 --> 16:06.415
And we have no idea where
they're gonna use it.

16:06.451 --> 16:07.816
I got something.
The field team just called in.

16:07.852 --> 16:09.618
A Little Sky employee saw
a truck drive off

16:09.654 --> 16:11.887
that had a marking on it.
A red star with seven points.

16:11.923 --> 16:14.957
Okay.
Red star, seven points.

16:14.993 --> 16:18.426
Okay. It's the logo
for Officiant Office Supply.

16:18.462 --> 16:20.563
They have a fleet of 1,000
trucks in the New York area.

16:20.599 --> 16:21.631
You think Roman's
gonna pull a McVeigh,

16:21.667 --> 16:23.299
use a truck as a bomb?

16:23.335 --> 16:25.501
Or it's a Trojan...
Horse, not condom.

16:25.537 --> 16:27.637
Hypergolic bombs are
relatively easy to conceal,

16:27.673 --> 16:28.938
and no one's gonna be checking

16:28.974 --> 16:30.506
a truck full of office supplies
that carefully.

16:30.542 --> 16:31.973
Yeah, but we have to
find this truck

16:32.009 --> 16:33.709
before it delivers its cargo.

16:33.745 --> 16:35.911
Oh, lovely.

16:35.947 --> 16:38.314
The sculptures,
are they Ermalinas?

16:38.350 --> 16:39.949
Good eye, Ms. Crawford,

16:39.985 --> 16:42.318
but the true draw
of this suite

16:42.354 --> 16:45.854
is its unparalleled view
of the East River.

16:45.890 --> 16:47.522
Okay, here we go.
Red light camera

16:47.558 --> 16:48.824
two blocks from Little Sky

16:48.860 --> 16:51.661
captured a truck
with a star marking on it.

16:51.697 --> 16:53.396
Got a license plate.

16:53.432 --> 16:55.964
This particular truck
only goes to one location.

16:56.000 --> 16:57.565
Oh, my God.

16:57.601 --> 17:00.873
You were right, Tom.
It is worth the price.

17:04.976 --> 17:08.542
Crawford's about to bomb
the United Nations.

17:08.579 --> 17:10.915
I hope everything is up to
your standards, Mr. Jakeman.

17:12.116 --> 17:13.786
It's perfect.

17:16.848 --> 17:18.773
Well, I'm impressed.

17:18.810 --> 17:22.140
Now, tell me more about
your ballroom options.

17:22.714 --> 17:24.179
- Tom, are you okay?
- Mr. Jakeman.

17:24.214 --> 17:25.714
Yeah, yeah,
it's just, um...

17:25.750 --> 17:27.428
another migraine.

17:27.464 --> 17:28.917
It took me by surprise.

17:28.953 --> 17:31.218
- I should get you home.
- No, uh...

17:31.254 --> 17:33.419
you finish up here.
I'll show myself out.

17:33.455 --> 17:35.189
- Are you sure? You seem...
- I'll be fine.

17:35.225 --> 17:36.962
I just need some rest.

17:40.363 --> 17:43.131
I understand a floor of
the hotel is under renovation.

17:43.167 --> 17:44.970
I trust that won't
be an issue?

17:48.505 --> 17:50.871
Assistant Director Reade,
Dana Coriano,

17:50.907 --> 17:52.940
Head of Security for the
United Nations Headquarters.

17:52.976 --> 17:55.209
- How's the evacuation going?
- We have over 6,000 staff members

17:55.245 --> 17:57.411
to account for, not to
mention visiting dignitaries.

17:57.447 --> 17:59.413
The buildings won't be cleared
for another 20 minutes.

17:59.449 --> 18:01.248
We're actually looking for
a truck that delivers here,

18:01.284 --> 18:03.351
Officiant Office Supply.

18:03.387 --> 18:05.821
Looks like it's already gone.

18:05.857 --> 18:06.888
According to the records,
they dropped off

18:06.924 --> 18:08.256
their delivery
at the loading dock,

18:08.292 --> 18:09.390
then left right before
we got your warning.

18:09.426 --> 18:11.092
The bomb's already inside.

18:11.128 --> 18:12.227
All right, Zapata and I
will check the loading dock.

18:12.263 --> 18:13.428
You guys stay here with Dana,

18:13.464 --> 18:14.496
see if anything else
is compromised.

18:14.532 --> 18:16.163
- Copy that.
- All right.

18:16.199 --> 18:19.234
I can't find anything
on this stupid laptop

18:19.270 --> 18:20.869
that tells us why Crawford
wants to attack the UN.

18:20.905 --> 18:23.371
Really? 'Cause I just
cracked a new drive

18:23.407 --> 18:25.106
and I'm pretty sure
I'm on to something here,

18:25.142 --> 18:26.373
like how Lynnette's wife
used to work

18:26.409 --> 18:27.878
for Franklin-Dorfman
Security.

18:29.280 --> 18:30.512
What?

18:30.548 --> 18:32.747
She's an IP lawyer now,
but back in the day,

18:32.783 --> 18:34.282
her firm did
a little consulting

18:34.318 --> 18:35.516
for Frank-Dizorf.

18:35.552 --> 18:36.985
I traced Lynnette's
credentials

18:37.021 --> 18:38.053
and they belong
to wifey's old law partner.

18:38.089 --> 18:39.286
They're on the drive.

18:39.322 --> 18:40.522
Lynnette is
a pretty solid hacker,

18:40.558 --> 18:42.023
so we just assumed

18:42.059 --> 18:44.125
that she breached
the Franklin-Dorfman server

18:44.161 --> 18:45.293
illegally to get the codes.

18:45.329 --> 18:46.995
She just logged right in.

18:47.031 --> 18:48.863
- Or her wife did.
- Yeah, but either way,

18:48.899 --> 18:50.798
her wife's implicated.
We can use that.

18:50.834 --> 18:53.200
If the UN doesn't
blow up first, yeah.

18:53.236 --> 18:54.805
<i>Patterson, we're
in the UN basement.</i>

18:57.375 --> 18:58.873
Red star, seven points.

18:58.909 --> 19:00.044
That's their logo.

19:07.517 --> 19:10.354
Why is the power on?
It's not even plugged in.

19:22.465 --> 19:24.431
A countdown timer.

19:24.467 --> 19:26.901
The copier's the bomb.

19:26.937 --> 19:30.572
Okay. Uh, see if you
can find anything

19:30.608 --> 19:31.907
<i>that could contain
the two chemicals</i>

19:31.943 --> 19:33.307
<i>and keep them separate.</i>

19:33.343 --> 19:35.142
Roman would've found a way
to keep them apart

19:35.178 --> 19:36.510
until he wanted it
to go off.

19:36.546 --> 19:38.013
Because the second
those chemicals mix,

19:38.049 --> 19:39.080
that whole neighborhood's
going up

19:39.116 --> 19:40.247
like the club on a Tuesday.

19:40.283 --> 19:41.515
All right, there's
a whole bunch

19:41.551 --> 19:42.984
of ink cartridges
inside the copier.

19:43.020 --> 19:44.986
Yeah, and a ton of spares
in boxes.

19:45.022 --> 19:46.822
If the copier goes off,
it's gonna set off

19:46.858 --> 19:48.890
- <i>a chain reaction.</i>
- That's why UN security

19:48.926 --> 19:50.025
couldn't find any chemicals,
because they would have

19:50.061 --> 19:51.293
had to crack open
every cartridge.

19:51.329 --> 19:52.960
That Roman...
brains and beauty.

19:52.996 --> 19:54.563
Okay, you need to look
for a mechanism

19:54.599 --> 19:56.363
that would
open the cartridges.

19:56.399 --> 19:58.099
<i>I'm guessing it's connected
to the countdown timer.</i>

19:58.135 --> 19:59.433
I don't see anything.
I guess the mechanical part

19:59.469 --> 20:01.503
of the bomb is sealed
inside the machine.

20:01.539 --> 20:03.170
<i>Okay, well that
makes things a little tricky.</i>

20:03.206 --> 20:04.573
Yeah, well, we only
have 24 seconds.

20:04.609 --> 20:06.140
<i>Okay, you're gonna
have to get</i>

20:06.176 --> 20:07.542
the cartridges
away from the copier

20:07.578 --> 20:09.214
and make sure that they
don't crack and mix.

20:19.590 --> 20:20.921
Wait.

20:20.957 --> 20:22.189
Good catch.

20:22.225 --> 20:24.458
Five seconds left!

20:26.898 --> 20:28.529
Pull it.
Just pull the wire.

20:31.502 --> 20:33.000
All right, we got it.

20:33.036 --> 20:35.039
The bomb is disarmed.
We're clear.

20:39.944 --> 20:43.277
Saved the day again.
Up top. Boom! Uhh!

20:43.313 --> 20:45.546
This is definitely featuring
in my new graphic novel.

20:45.582 --> 20:47.148
Have I told you about that,
by the way?

20:47.184 --> 20:50.150
It's the adults-only chronicle
of billionaire tech guru

20:50.186 --> 20:52.086
and retired Harlem
Globetrotter mitch.org.

20:52.122 --> 20:53.955
See, he joins forces
to fight crime

20:53.991 --> 20:56.224
with swinging married cops
Keller and Jade,

20:56.260 --> 20:58.459
brooding hunk Agent Reese
and his annoying

20:58.495 --> 21:00.562
but his occasionally
helpful assistant, Peterson.

21:00.598 --> 21:02.363
And that's you...
you're Peterson.

21:02.399 --> 21:04.064
This was too easy.

21:04.100 --> 21:05.367
Or we're just that good.

21:05.403 --> 21:08.069
Something's not right.

21:08.105 --> 21:09.437
Why the UN?

21:09.473 --> 21:10.906
I don't know.
It's a big, flashy target.

21:10.942 --> 21:12.439
What terrorist wouldn't
want to bomb the UN?

21:12.475 --> 21:14.242
Yeah, that's the thing.
Crawford's not a terrorist.

21:14.278 --> 21:16.945
It's like Jane said, he doesn't
just want death and chaos,

21:16.981 --> 21:20.215
he has a very specific
reason for his violence.

21:20.251 --> 21:21.917
- Yeah, but Roman would kill a...
- Roman may be

21:21.953 --> 21:24.052
the only other person
I've met who loves games

21:24.088 --> 21:26.587
and annoyingly intricate
puzzles as much as I do.

21:26.623 --> 21:28.122
Rude.

21:28.158 --> 21:30.958
No, these men's nuances
have nuances,

21:30.994 --> 21:32.627
and I'm supposed to believe
that when they team up,

21:32.663 --> 21:36.398
their grand plan
is to set off one bomb,

21:36.434 --> 21:39.367
delivered imprecisely,
to kill a large

21:39.403 --> 21:42.003
but random assortment
of UN workers?

21:42.039 --> 21:44.238
Okay, when you list it
all in a row like that,

21:44.274 --> 21:45.606
you make a valid point.

21:45.642 --> 21:46.675
There must be something

21:46.711 --> 21:47.913
we're not seeing.

21:50.046 --> 21:52.246
I think it's time to have
another chat with Lynnette.

21:52.282 --> 21:54.349
Okay.

21:54.385 --> 21:56.083
The codes
you gave to Crawford

21:56.119 --> 21:58.352
were just used in an
attempted terror attack

21:58.388 --> 22:00.220
on the United Nations.

22:00.256 --> 22:01.488
You want to go down
with the ship,

22:01.524 --> 22:03.358
that's your prerogative.

22:03.394 --> 22:06.298
But are you willing to drag
your wife down with you?

22:07.665 --> 22:09.163
That's a mic drop.

22:09.199 --> 22:12.100
My wife had nothing
to do with this.

22:12.136 --> 22:13.968
Good luck proving that.

22:14.004 --> 22:16.504
You used her old
law partner's credentials

22:16.540 --> 22:20.175
to steal the security codes,
meaning she provided

22:20.211 --> 22:21.709
material support to terrorists

22:21.745 --> 22:24.245
and she will be going
to super-max prison,

22:24.281 --> 22:26.648
unless you go ahead
and tell me why Crawford

22:26.684 --> 22:29.354
was targeting the UN
right now.

22:30.487 --> 22:32.519
I don't know the whole plan,

22:32.555 --> 22:33.688
I swear.

22:33.724 --> 22:35.724
It probably has...

22:35.760 --> 22:38.258
something to do
with the pipeline.

22:38.294 --> 22:39.660
What pipeline?

22:39.696 --> 22:42.130
There's a huge oil pipeline

22:42.166 --> 22:44.332
going to break ground
any day.

22:44.368 --> 22:48.303
Crawford's been obsessed
about it for months

22:48.339 --> 22:50.537
and he said whoever's
in charge of the project

22:50.573 --> 22:53.073
is gonna make trillions.
Kambezi and Odan...

22:53.109 --> 22:56.010
Kambezi and Odan?
Those are the countries

22:56.046 --> 22:57.344
that the pipeline
is running through?

22:57.380 --> 22:58.382
They will be.

23:03.320 --> 23:04.686
The land.

23:04.722 --> 23:08.355
The land that Crawford
acquired from Bruyere.

23:08.391 --> 23:10.057
It borders both countries.
This is it.

23:10.093 --> 23:11.458
- I'm right, right?
- He wants the pipeline

23:11.494 --> 23:12.664
built through his property.

23:14.231 --> 23:17.798
Kambezi and Odan have
a long, violent history.

23:17.834 --> 23:19.400
Oh, God.

23:19.436 --> 23:21.468
Their leaders
just agreed to sit down

23:21.504 --> 23:24.272
for their first peace talks
in a decade at the UN today.

23:24.308 --> 23:25.774
If the leaders of both
those nations are killed,

23:25.810 --> 23:27.208
there'll be all-out war.

23:27.244 --> 23:28.610
The pipeline
won't move forward.

23:28.646 --> 23:29.744
They'll have to reroute it

23:29.780 --> 23:31.612
through the one possible
alternative.

23:31.648 --> 23:32.746
Crawford's land.

23:32.782 --> 23:34.548
It's not a terrorist attack.

23:34.584 --> 23:36.253
It's an assassination.

23:42.968 --> 23:44.334
<i>Weller, Jane,</i>

23:44.370 --> 23:45.796
<i>Crawford is targeting
the leaders</i>

23:45.832 --> 23:48.065
of Kambezi and Odan.
They're still in danger.

23:48.101 --> 23:51.003
We need to find King Almasi
and President Botros right now.

23:51.039 --> 23:52.670
What if the bomb
was to flush them out,

23:52.706 --> 23:55.573
evacuate the buildings
to get them out in the open?

23:55.609 --> 23:57.941
We're surrounded
by vantage points.

23:57.977 --> 24:00.544
There could be snipers
in any of these buildings.

24:00.580 --> 24:02.412
All these people
are sitting ducks.

24:02.448 --> 24:04.081
We've got to find them.

24:04.117 --> 24:07.084
President Botros and
King Almasi were meeting

24:07.120 --> 24:08.818
for peace talks
in the conference building.

24:08.854 --> 24:10.821
Their evac point
should be here,

24:10.857 --> 24:13.361
in the northeast corner...
there.

24:14.761 --> 24:16.994
King Almasi,
President Botros,

24:17.030 --> 24:18.162
I'm Kurt Weller
with the FBI.

24:18.198 --> 24:20.096
We have credible intel
informing us

24:20.132 --> 24:21.632
there's a threat
on both your lives.

24:21.668 --> 24:22.767
For your safety,
we're gonna take you

24:22.803 --> 24:23.834
to our New York Office.

24:23.870 --> 24:25.469
I'm afraid
that's not possible.

24:25.505 --> 24:27.738
UN security protocols
dictates that world leaders

24:27.774 --> 24:29.440
be brought to
a prearranged safe house

24:29.476 --> 24:31.741
in an emergency under
the care of the Secret Service.

24:31.777 --> 24:33.009
We know the criminals
that are targeting them.

24:33.045 --> 24:34.879
We've dealt with them before.

24:34.915 --> 24:36.713
And yet these criminals
are still at large?

24:36.749 --> 24:38.481
The evacuation
is part of their plan.

24:38.517 --> 24:40.750
We think they were counting
on you following protocol.

24:40.786 --> 24:42.452
The FBI has
no jurisdiction here.

24:42.488 --> 24:43.586
This is not a debate.

24:43.622 --> 24:44.854
Okay. At least let us
go with them.

24:44.890 --> 24:46.427
Two more pairs of eyes
can't hurt.

24:47.627 --> 24:49.727
Fine.
Get 'em out of here.

24:49.763 --> 24:50.831
Let's go.

24:59.072 --> 25:02.139
We're removing all unauthorized
personnel from the hotel now.

25:02.175 --> 25:03.540
No one will be
admitted to the premises

25:03.576 --> 25:05.042
without Secret Service
credentials.

25:05.078 --> 25:07.181
The safe house
is on the 14th floor.

25:11.685 --> 25:14.485
I did not consent to be
sequestered with her.

25:14.521 --> 25:16.487
How do I know she's not involved
with these criminals?

25:16.523 --> 25:19.623
Please, I barely got you to
the table for these accords.

25:19.659 --> 25:21.892
Perhaps it is you who did
all this just to derail them.

25:21.928 --> 25:23.693
You've been plotting
against me for a long time,

25:23.729 --> 25:25.829
spread rumors and lies
to my own people.

25:25.865 --> 25:28.031
Now, let me out of here.
That is an order.

25:28.067 --> 25:29.900
I'm sorry, but no one
is going anywhere.

25:29.936 --> 25:32.902
Neither of your countries
is behind this.

25:32.938 --> 25:35.506
The man who's targeting you
is Hank Crawford.

25:35.542 --> 25:39.677
Crawford! That snake
wanted to charge my country

25:39.713 --> 25:42.779
to transport our own
resources from our own land.

25:42.815 --> 25:44.515
He approached both of us.

25:44.551 --> 25:47.517
He wanted to buy land and
rights to build a pipeline

25:47.553 --> 25:50.187
to transport Odan's oil
through Kambezi to the coast.

25:50.223 --> 25:52.222
- And you said no.
- Mm-hmm.

25:52.258 --> 25:54.525
As often as
I disagree with King Almasi,

25:54.561 --> 25:57.260
we've both seen what happens
when white businessmen

25:57.296 --> 25:59.262
control a country's resources.

25:59.298 --> 26:01.731
So we thought it made more
sense to come together

26:01.767 --> 26:03.066
and bargain in peace

26:03.102 --> 26:04.869
and keep control of
our own resources

26:04.905 --> 26:08.005
rather than sell out
to foreign powers.

26:08.041 --> 26:09.672
Then hold onto that.

26:09.708 --> 26:10.940
Everything
that's happening today

26:10.976 --> 26:13.009
is just Crawford
trying to control you

26:13.045 --> 26:14.914
and your countries
all over again.

26:15.982 --> 26:17.518
Don't let him win.

26:22.022 --> 26:23.554
- Seriously?
- What?

26:23.590 --> 26:25.021
Don't look at me like that.
Sometimes that works.

26:25.057 --> 26:26.856
No, this is not
a Sega Genesis.

26:26.892 --> 26:29.093
The problem
is not on our end.

26:29.129 --> 26:31.295
I'm connected
to the hotel systems,

26:31.331 --> 26:32.696
but there's
some kind of interference.

26:32.732 --> 26:34.131
- The video's all jumpy.
- Wait a minute.

26:34.167 --> 26:35.231
I know this one.

26:35.267 --> 26:36.700
Someone's tapped
into the drop.

26:36.736 --> 26:37.767
That's how I used to steal

26:37.803 --> 26:39.036
adult entertainment channels

26:39.072 --> 26:40.304
from Mr. Yavuz,
who lived next door

26:40.340 --> 26:41.671
So you're saying
the connection is weak

26:41.707 --> 26:43.606
because there's
a third person

26:43.642 --> 26:45.675
- using the security feed?
- Who's tapped into it

26:45.711 --> 26:47.545
right at the source.
Oh, that's not good.

26:47.581 --> 26:49.012
Yeah, that is very not good.

26:49.048 --> 26:50.614
It means the assassins
are already in the hotel,

26:50.650 --> 26:52.615
and I can't cut
their camera access

26:52.651 --> 26:53.816
without blinding us too.

26:53.852 --> 26:56.287
Did you see that?

26:56.323 --> 26:57.688
One of the cameras
just went out.

26:57.724 --> 26:59.289
The one in
the service elevator?

27:01.127 --> 27:02.793
I'm afraid
it's out of my hands.

27:02.829 --> 27:04.161
This charity ball

27:04.197 --> 27:06.296
is one of the biggest
events of the year.

27:15.074 --> 27:16.105
- Tom, are you okay?
- Mr. Jakeman.

27:16.141 --> 27:18.174
Yeah, yeah,
it's just, um...

27:18.210 --> 27:19.212
another migraine.

27:22.349 --> 27:25.682
Oh, God, it's coming
right to them.

27:25.718 --> 27:28.052
Weller, Jane, the service
elevator has been compromised.

27:28.088 --> 27:29.185
It's headed
right to the 14th floor.

27:29.221 --> 27:30.688
You need to tell
the Secret Service

27:30.724 --> 27:32.189
you all need to get
out of the hotel right now.

27:41.034 --> 27:43.667
Agent Briggs, here
to relieve your team, sir.

27:43.703 --> 27:45.068
You're to secure
the perimeter.

27:45.104 --> 27:46.973
I'll just need to see
some ID and confirm with HQ.

28:08.995 --> 28:11.260
They must have gone out
through this adjoining room.

28:11.296 --> 28:12.829
You ready?

28:12.865 --> 28:14.033
Wait.

28:18.938 --> 28:22.171
Jane. That's why the UN
bomb never went off.

28:22.207 --> 28:23.406
We'll have to be quick.

28:23.442 --> 28:25.008
This place will be
swarming with Feds soon.

28:25.044 --> 28:27.111
Botros and Almasi
are in the east stairwell

28:27.147 --> 28:28.746
with two FBI Agents.

28:28.782 --> 28:31.018
Shoot to kill.

28:35.925 --> 28:39.552
Son of a bitch.
Uh, slight complication.

28:39.588 --> 28:40.626
<i>Roman is in the building.</i>

28:40.662 --> 28:42.268
<i>I've got eyes on him
coming out of the suite</i>

28:42.304 --> 28:43.429
<i>on the 14th floor.</i>

28:43.465 --> 28:44.663
He's got a bunch
of guys with him

28:44.699 --> 28:45.664
and they're all dressed
as Secret Service.

28:45.700 --> 28:47.267
And since the security feed

28:47.303 --> 28:48.800
is on the fritz due to
little Romeo's connections...

28:48.836 --> 28:50.903
We can't tell who's legit
and who's with Roman.

28:50.939 --> 28:53.306
They've got real comms too.
I'm informing the Secret Service

28:53.342 --> 28:54.707
they're compromised,
but for now...

28:54.743 --> 28:56.642
Trust no one.
Don't shoot at them

28:56.678 --> 28:57.943
unless they shoot at us.
Got it.

28:57.979 --> 28:59.511
Exactly, but
I'm gonna do my best

28:59.547 --> 29:00.947
to help you avoid
everyone altogether.

29:00.983 --> 29:03.219
Exit the stairwell now.

29:10.292 --> 29:12.424
We need backup
in here now.

29:12.460 --> 29:14.427
They're on their way
with the team. So is the NYPD.

29:14.463 --> 29:16.296
- <i>But they're five minutes out.</i>
- We can't wait.

29:16.332 --> 29:18.530
- We've got to get out of here now.
- <i>Yeah, I'm working on it.</i>

29:18.566 --> 29:20.466
We have to assume
the elevators are compromised,

29:20.502 --> 29:23.937
so I need you to get
to the west stairwell,

29:23.973 --> 29:26.743
so turn left at the end
of this hall. Go, go, go!

29:32.348 --> 29:34.814
They're making their way
across the fifth floor.

29:36.986 --> 29:38.188
Move!

29:40.755 --> 29:43.422
<i>Okay, listen to me.
I've cut the camera feeds.</i>

29:43.458 --> 29:45.691
Roman can't see you,
but that means I can't either.

29:45.727 --> 29:47.994
Now, I need you to get
to that west stairwell,

29:48.030 --> 29:50.363
take it down
to the third floor.

29:50.399 --> 29:53.736
There's a construction
chute in Room 305.

29:56.604 --> 29:59.508
They should still be
on this floor. Find them!

30:05.346 --> 30:08.483
- Go. Go.
- Go, go.

30:16.925 --> 30:20.526
Room 305 is this way.
Follow me!

30:22.430 --> 30:24.831
- No! No!
- Come here!

30:24.867 --> 30:26.703
Come here! Don't worry about it.
Coming back!

30:29.405 --> 30:31.371
I'll hold them off!
Get them out of here!

30:35.878 --> 30:38.911
Okay, I need to have
a look at that.

30:38.947 --> 30:41.314
We need to find something
to stop that bleeding.

30:41.350 --> 30:42.685
Here.

30:44.719 --> 30:46.552
You are going to
be fine, King Almasi.

30:46.588 --> 30:48.787
We will both live to see
our countries have peace

30:48.823 --> 30:49.855
and flourish.

30:56.598 --> 30:59.565
Patterson, King Almasi's
been shot, okay?

30:59.601 --> 31:00.799
<i>We need to get him
to a hospital.</i>

31:00.835 --> 31:01.867
Reade and Zapata
are out on the street.

31:01.903 --> 31:02.871
Send him down.

31:09.977 --> 31:11.411
<i>My longarm's out. Hurry up!</i>

31:11.447 --> 31:12.545
- You've got to go feet first.
- Okay.

31:12.581 --> 31:13.578
Here we go.
Okay?

31:13.614 --> 31:15.681
- Yeah.
- Ready?

31:15.717 --> 31:17.586
One, two, three, go!

31:26.661 --> 31:28.694
Feet first.

31:28.730 --> 31:29.961
- Okay?
- Okay.

31:29.997 --> 31:32.431
Now, keep your arms up.
Like that. Ready?

31:32.467 --> 31:33.902
One, two, three...

31:36.037 --> 31:37.372
Oh!

31:44.746 --> 31:46.879
I got ya.
I got ya.

31:51.553 --> 31:53.656
I'm out of ammo.
I'm heading to you.

31:57.659 --> 31:58.857
We've got to
barricade the door.

31:58.893 --> 32:00.392
Throw that!

32:00.428 --> 32:02.564
Throw it!

32:15.944 --> 32:17.046
Okay.

32:18.580 --> 32:19.716
- You ready?
- Yeah, I'm ready.

32:22.551 --> 32:24.419
One, two...

32:25.954 --> 32:26.956
- Three.
- Three. Go!

32:40.101 --> 32:42.402
Another win for Remi.

32:51.213 --> 32:53.512
I just got off the phone
with the US Attorney,

32:53.548 --> 32:55.547
and with
the attempted bombing

32:55.583 --> 32:58.718
and the assassinations, we
have enough to arrest Crawford.

32:58.754 --> 33:00.553
It still won't
be easy to bring him in.

33:00.589 --> 33:02.421
He owns land in
non-extradition countries

33:02.457 --> 33:03.823
and he has connections
all around the world.

33:03.859 --> 33:05.190
Roman's still
out there too.

33:05.226 --> 33:07.192
The sooner we find
them both, the better.

33:07.228 --> 33:09.461
They know we have them
dead to rights now.

33:09.497 --> 33:11.096
Yeah, but they're backed
into a corner,

33:11.132 --> 33:13.598
so there's no telling
what they could do

33:13.634 --> 33:15.170
or who could get caught
in the crossfire.

33:23.245 --> 33:24.447
Patterson.

33:26.614 --> 33:29.949
- Hey.
- I just got a call from Dana Coriano at the UN.

33:29.985 --> 33:32.218
She's saying that President
Botros' phone is missing.

33:32.254 --> 33:34.219
She claims it was still in the
hotel suite when they escaped,

33:34.255 --> 33:35.854
but the Secret Service
can't find it.

33:35.890 --> 33:38.024
Do you think Roman took it?
I mean, if it's got

33:38.060 --> 33:40.026
Botros' schedule,
her contacts,

33:40.062 --> 33:42.127
he could still be
targeting her and Almasi.

33:42.163 --> 33:43.696
Well, that's what
I want to find out.

33:43.732 --> 33:46.035
- Can you bring up the footage?
- Yeah.

33:48.136 --> 33:50.068
All right, here's Roman
and his baddies

33:50.104 --> 33:52.904
leaving the suite.
No sign of the phone.

33:52.940 --> 33:54.640
Did he come back later?

33:54.676 --> 33:55.807
Let's see.

33:55.843 --> 33:58.610
Who's this?
The timestamp says

33:58.646 --> 34:00.146
it was 20 minutes
after the shootout.

34:00.182 --> 34:02.148
Wait.

34:02.184 --> 34:04.053
This is after
Roman escaped.

34:05.653 --> 34:07.122
That can't be right,
can it?

34:09.056 --> 34:12.023
Roman didn't take
the president's phone.

34:12.059 --> 34:13.128
Zapata did.

34:20.248 --> 34:21.893
Look, we don't want to
point any fingers.

34:21.929 --> 34:23.244
I'm sure there's
a reasonable explanation.

34:23.280 --> 34:25.038
Oh, so you let Roman escape

34:25.074 --> 34:26.523
with the phone
of a world leader,

34:26.559 --> 34:28.927
a phone he could use to
sabotage their governments,

34:28.963 --> 34:30.427
so now you're looking for
someone else to blame.

34:30.463 --> 34:34.768
Not someone. You.

34:45.445 --> 34:46.514
Why did you take it?

34:49.916 --> 34:51.851
Because the CIA wanted me to.

34:53.454 --> 34:54.885
What for?

34:54.920 --> 34:56.353
This is what we do.

34:56.389 --> 34:57.889
We're the Central
Intelligence Agency.

34:57.925 --> 34:59.356
We gather intelligence.

34:59.392 --> 35:00.425
We're gonna
need that phone back.

35:00.461 --> 35:01.492
I'm not about to be party

35:01.528 --> 35:02.693
to an international incident.

35:02.729 --> 35:04.733
Yeah, it's fine.
Give it back.

35:08.936 --> 35:12.740
I can't because
I gave it to you.

35:15.343 --> 35:17.374
Could we speak privately?

35:17.410 --> 35:19.744
Oh, come on, Keaton.
They know.

35:19.780 --> 35:21.378
- They saw me on tape.
- Tasha,

35:21.414 --> 35:22.880
I don't know what
you're doing right now.

35:22.916 --> 35:25.650
You asked me to get you the
phone, I got you the phone.

35:25.686 --> 35:27.351
You want to do this here,
that's fine.

35:27.387 --> 35:29.454
I did not ask for you
to get me that phone,

35:29.490 --> 35:30.989
nor did I receive it.
I don't know what

35:31.025 --> 35:32.356
you think you're gonna
gain by doing this

35:32.392 --> 35:33.458
in front of them,
but I can't

35:33.494 --> 35:35.460
protect you on this.
The CIA takes

35:35.496 --> 35:36.894
no responsibility
for this action.

35:36.930 --> 35:38.662
Okay, this is crazy.

35:38.698 --> 35:40.932
So, why would I
take it

35:40.968 --> 35:42.766
if it wasn't for the CIA?

35:42.802 --> 35:44.501
I have no idea. Money?

35:44.537 --> 35:45.936
A world leader's phone
would fetch a lot

35:45.972 --> 35:48.472
on the black market.
You off the wagon again,

35:48.508 --> 35:49.773
placing bets
you can't cover?

35:49.809 --> 35:50.941
Maybe you saw
a quick way to settle up.

35:50.977 --> 35:52.744
- Why are you doing this?
- Why am I...

35:52.780 --> 35:55.780
Do you have any idea
the chance I took on you?

35:55.816 --> 35:58.650
Bringing a hot-headed FBI
amateur into the big leagues?

35:58.686 --> 36:00.517
Because this is
on my head now.

36:00.553 --> 36:02.820
You just became my mistake.

36:02.856 --> 36:04.489
You're right. Maybe we
should speak privately.

36:04.525 --> 36:05.660
You think so?

36:11.564 --> 36:13.400
What the hell
just happened?

36:31.852 --> 36:33.918
- Hey.
- <i>Tom, thank God!</i>

36:33.954 --> 36:35.552
Where are you?
Are you okay?

36:35.588 --> 36:37.421
I went back to our room
and you weren't there,

36:37.457 --> 36:38.923
<i>and my father isn't
answering his phone.</i>

36:38.959 --> 36:41.860
Yeah, sorry.
Um, I got called away.

36:41.896 --> 36:44.929
This is about what happened
at the hotel, isn't it?

36:44.965 --> 36:47.065
<i>The manager said we can't
hold the charity ball there</i>

36:47.101 --> 36:50.101
because someone shot it up.
It's all over the news.

36:50.137 --> 36:51.568
<i>Did you have something
to do with this?</i>

36:51.604 --> 36:53.405
<i>The way you disappeared...</i>

36:53.441 --> 36:55.977
<i>Tom, what happened today?</i>

37:00.046 --> 37:02.847
I'm sorry. I'll, um...

37:02.883 --> 37:05.883
I'll tell you everything
as soon as I can, I promise.

37:06.986 --> 37:09.420
<i>I let your dad down.</i>

37:09.456 --> 37:12.456
<i>Just give me some time
to fix this, okay?</i>

37:12.492 --> 37:14.528
I love you.

37:18.465 --> 37:19.731
Is this what it's like
to wait for your buddy

37:19.767 --> 37:20.898
outside the
principal's office?

37:20.934 --> 37:22.132
'Cause I was usually
the one in there,

37:22.168 --> 37:23.601
- getting in trouble.
- Really?

37:23.637 --> 37:25.503
'Cause Boston told me
you were a hall monitor.

37:25.539 --> 37:28.807
I would not have wanted
Boston to tell you that.

37:28.843 --> 37:29.944
Hey, Tasha!

37:33.046 --> 37:36.648
Does anybody know how
to file for unemployment?

37:36.684 --> 37:38.081
I just got fired.

37:38.117 --> 37:41.085
Keaton said the CIA
couldn't trust me anymore.

37:41.121 --> 37:42.920
That's rich,
coming from them.

37:42.956 --> 37:45.757
I believe you.
We believe you.

37:45.793 --> 37:46.891
You wouldn't have
taken that phone

37:46.927 --> 37:47.925
unless Keaton
ordered you to.

37:47.961 --> 37:49.494
They got caught,
all right?

37:49.530 --> 37:50.829
So now they're
throwing you under the bus.

37:50.865 --> 37:52.095
We'll figure this out.

37:52.131 --> 37:53.565
You know,
I know a great lawyer

37:53.601 --> 37:55.032
if you speak
conversational Latvian.

37:55.068 --> 37:57.101
Guys, it's...
It's done.

37:57.137 --> 37:58.503
You have me on tape.

37:58.539 --> 38:00.838
It's my word
against the CIA.

38:00.874 --> 38:03.173
I can't fight that,
and even if I did,

38:03.209 --> 38:04.842
I'd still be out a job.

38:04.878 --> 38:07.045
So come back to the FBI.

38:07.081 --> 38:10.782
I can't. Think about it.
Guys, I am poison.

38:10.818 --> 38:13.717
Nobody is gonna trust you
if you're working with me.

38:13.753 --> 38:15.552
- Let us worry about that.
- No.

38:15.588 --> 38:17.121
I'm out of moves.

38:17.157 --> 38:20.093
I have to figure it out
on my own.

38:30.236 --> 38:31.536
You can't leave.

38:31.572 --> 38:32.871
I can't stay.

38:32.907 --> 38:35.240
Why not?
Why are you giving up?

38:35.276 --> 38:37.876
I'm on a path, Reade,
and I can't go back

38:37.912 --> 38:39.744
and I can't take
you guys with me,

38:39.780 --> 38:42.079
so, please, don't make
this harder than it is

38:42.115 --> 38:44.581
- and let me go.
- No.

38:44.617 --> 38:45.853
Not this time.

38:58.264 --> 38:59.963
You're rebounding from Meg,

38:59.999 --> 39:01.032
I just got fired
from the CIA...

39:01.068 --> 39:02.266
there are a million reasons

39:02.302 --> 39:04.135
why we shouldn't
do this right now.

39:04.171 --> 39:05.269
Look, if you think about
anything long enough,

39:05.305 --> 39:06.704
you'll find a reason
not to do it.

39:06.740 --> 39:08.075
Whatever it is between us...

39:09.809 --> 39:11.144
I'm tired of thinking.

39:12.746 --> 39:15.148
I can't.

39:29.630 --> 39:30.631
Hmm.

39:36.903 --> 39:38.869
This day's been
a lot of fun.

39:38.905 --> 39:40.671
- Hmm.
- Hmm?

39:40.707 --> 39:43.807
Yeah, one big
happy family reunion.

39:43.843 --> 39:47.211
Funny how there always seems
to be bombs involved with mine.

39:47.247 --> 39:49.012
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

39:49.048 --> 39:52.215
I realized something
about what Shepherd said.

39:52.251 --> 39:56.056
Your bond with Roman
is unique.

39:57.256 --> 39:59.624
The connection
with Roman is real,

39:59.660 --> 40:01.892
and it's intense.

40:01.928 --> 40:03.327
When Remi and Roman
were kids,

40:03.363 --> 40:04.762
they walked
through fire together

40:04.798 --> 40:07.068
and they came out
the other side.

40:08.334 --> 40:11.769
But I'm not Remi.

40:11.805 --> 40:14.671
She was half of a whole
with Roman,

40:14.707 --> 40:16.106
and she might not have
been able to survive

40:16.142 --> 40:19.581
without her brother,
but I can.

40:25.686 --> 40:27.822
My other half is you.

40:35.963 --> 40:38.095
What is that?

40:38.131 --> 40:39.601
We need to get Patterson.

40:54.314 --> 40:55.813
Tasha?

40:55.849 --> 40:56.914
Let's not think about it.

41:23.910 --> 41:25.742
Roman must have ended
his program overload.

41:25.778 --> 41:27.744
The false tattoo hits
have all gone silent.

41:27.780 --> 41:30.280
- So this hit is real?
- Oh, it's very real.

41:30.316 --> 41:32.749
The platonic solid tattoo
decrypts to a website

41:32.785 --> 41:35.753
that has always been blank
until now.

41:35.789 --> 41:37.057
A video was just uploaded
a few minutes ago.

41:42.329 --> 41:47.231
<i>Moreover, what from being so
long in twilight or darkness,</i>

41:47.267 --> 41:49.166
<i>his eyes
had acquired the faculty</i>

41:49.202 --> 41:51.836
<i>of distinguishing
three objects in the night,</i>

41:51.872 --> 41:56.039
<i>words common

41:56.075 --> 41:59.713
<i>I think it's time
we finish what we started.</i>

42:00.947 --> 42:03.380
<i>One last game, sis.</i>

42:03.416 --> 42:05.119
<i>Winner take all.</i>
