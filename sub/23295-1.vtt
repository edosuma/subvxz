00:38.000 --> 00:39.560
Whoo-hoo!

00:40.240 --> 00:43.160
{\an8}-[meows]
-Don't worry, Tabby, we can do this.

00:55.440 --> 00:56.280
{\an8}Maud!

00:56.720 --> 00:57.560
Enid!

00:57.920 --> 00:58.760
Well met.

00:59.080 --> 01:00.480
Wait for me!

01:02.120 --> 01:03.920
Wait, Mil. Look out for the...

01:05.880 --> 01:07.200
[crow croaking]

01:07.280 --> 01:08.120
...tree.

01:10.000 --> 01:11.840
[Maud and Enid chuckling]

01:13.600 --> 01:14.720
You nailed it!

01:15.000 --> 01:16.640
Might have been practicing.

01:24.240 --> 01:26.400
[Mildred] <i>This year is gonna be</i>
<i>so different.</i>

01:27.800 --> 01:31.200
<i>No more crash landings,</i>
<i>no more clumsy mistakes.</i>

01:33.120 --> 01:34.400
<i>No more disasters.</i>

01:34.720 --> 01:37.120
[bubbling]

01:37.200 --> 01:41.560
[Mildred shouting] <i>This term is going to</i>
<i>be brilliaaaaaaaant!</i>

01:48.760 --> 01:49.880
My project!

01:51.840 --> 01:53.880
Is it supposed to be able to fly?

01:54.280 --> 01:55.120
No!

01:56.880 --> 01:58.280
You go on without me!

01:58.840 --> 02:00.720
[crows croaking]

02:02.320 --> 02:03.680
-[screams]
-[gasps]

02:04.840 --> 02:06.800
Sorry, Ethel.

02:07.200 --> 02:09.280
I think I'm just a bit nervous.

02:10.080 --> 02:11.039
Of what?

02:11.680 --> 02:16.040
Flying, falling off,
Ms. Hardbroom yelling at me.

02:16.480 --> 02:18.680
Losing my powers like poor Esmerelda.

02:19.000 --> 02:21.280
Sybil, you're a Hallow, aren't you?

02:22.840 --> 02:24.880
Then you'll be absolutely fine.

02:33.960 --> 02:35.440
I hope Millie hurries up.

02:43.480 --> 02:46.200
-[girl] It's great to be back!
-[woman] In here. One minute.

02:46.280 --> 02:49.120
[bell ringing]

02:49.200 --> 02:50.760
[woman] Come on, girls, hurry up!

02:53.960 --> 02:57.600
[indistinct chatter]

03:00.720 --> 03:03.440
First day at Cackle's.
Think I'm gonna explode!

03:03.680 --> 03:06.000
Please don't.
This uniform's brand-new.

03:06.360 --> 03:09.520
-You're the funny one from selection day.
-Am I?

03:10.080 --> 03:12.480
-Well met. I'm...
-[cat meows]

03:13.480 --> 03:15.360
Beatrice Bunch. Bea for short.

03:15.680 --> 03:18.120
Clarice Twigg. Well met, Bea for short.

03:18.680 --> 03:19.560
[giggles]

03:20.280 --> 03:22.760
[chatter continues]

03:25.480 --> 03:28.000
-[girl] Where do first-years go?
-[girl 2] This way.

03:28.200 --> 03:29.080
On the left.

03:29.160 --> 03:32.400
Here they come, the future of witchcraft.

03:32.480 --> 03:35.760
I admire your positivity after last year.

03:35.840 --> 03:36.760
Precisely.

03:37.040 --> 03:39.880
We couldn't possibly have a debacle
like that again.

03:41.240 --> 03:43.960
This term is going to be brilliant.

03:53.560 --> 03:54.680
-Well met.
-Well met.

03:57.160 --> 03:58.560
[Mildred] Ethel, that's mine!

03:59.240 --> 04:01.160
Your project nearly took my head off!

04:01.560 --> 04:03.400
Sorry. Let me help you up.

04:05.920 --> 04:07.880
-[screaming]
-[Ethel gasps]

04:08.160 --> 04:12.840
Now, you may recall
we had a few security issues last term.

04:13.880 --> 04:15.360
[screaming continues]

04:16.320 --> 04:18.200
Let me assure you all, however,

04:18.480 --> 04:23.760
that every possible step has been taken
to ensure the school is 100 percent...

04:23.920 --> 04:25.280
[all gasp, scream]

04:26.920 --> 04:27.760
...safe.

04:28.200 --> 04:29.800
[screaming continues]

04:31.320 --> 04:32.360
[all gasping]

04:32.800 --> 04:34.760
[students gasping, murmuring]

04:40.400 --> 04:42.520
Just the whole school looking, then.

04:43.120 --> 04:43.960
No big deal.

04:44.640 --> 04:49.200
Welcome back, Mildred Hubble.

04:54.640 --> 04:56.800
Shouldn't we do something to help?

04:58.000 --> 04:59.200
Mildred's way beyond help.

04:59.920 --> 05:03.040
She thinks she's come up with a spell
that makes animals talk.

05:04.520 --> 05:05.360
[Sybil sighs]

05:08.360 --> 05:10.960
Find your mistress.
There's a good broom.

05:19.280 --> 05:20.120
Okay.

05:28.480 --> 05:29.520
[grunts] Come on.

05:38.320 --> 05:42.640
<i>Upside down, inside out,</i>
<i>scream and shout, get me out!</i>

05:42.720 --> 05:43.560
[snaps fingers]

05:44.800 --> 05:45.640
[sighs]

05:49.560 --> 05:51.840
I am really sorry, Ms. Cackle.
My project flew off,

05:51.920 --> 05:54.040
and then there was a tile loose
and I ended--

05:54.120 --> 05:56.280
-[Cackle] No harm done, Mildred.
-[cracking]

05:56.360 --> 05:58.200
[sighs] Now, where was I?

06:00.280 --> 06:03.120
Uh, yes, safety.

06:03.480 --> 06:05.480
[cracking, rumbling]

06:07.960 --> 06:08.800
Felicity.

06:09.200 --> 06:10.040
Well met.

06:10.120 --> 06:12.240
[rumbling, cracking continues]

06:15.880 --> 06:17.720
[cracking continues]

06:17.800 --> 06:20.280
We've clearly got some work to do
on the roof.

06:22.280 --> 06:24.200
[girls murmuring]

06:24.280 --> 06:28.440
Apart from that, I'm certain you really
couldn't be more protected

06:28.520 --> 06:30.520
than here at Cackle's.

06:30.600 --> 06:32.240
-[cracking]
-[girls exclaiming]

06:32.320 --> 06:34.160
[rumbling]

06:34.240 --> 06:35.880
[all screaming]

06:44.520 --> 06:45.640
[stones thudding]

06:45.960 --> 06:47.040
[sighs]

06:47.120 --> 06:48.680
The school just collapsed,

06:49.680 --> 06:51.040
didn't it, Ms. Hardbroom?

06:51.120 --> 06:52.600
[thudding continues]

06:52.680 --> 06:55.600
I believe it did, Ms. Cackle.

06:57.040 --> 06:58.520
[Cackle inhales]

07:03.000 --> 07:04.680
[crows croaking]

07:17.400 --> 07:21.000
I've used an extra strong binding spell
on the walls.

07:21.080 --> 07:23.320
The rest of the school
isn't going anywhere.

07:24.440 --> 07:25.960
Any idea what caused it?

07:29.360 --> 07:33.600
I've just destroyed the school
in the first five minutes of term.

07:34.200 --> 07:37.840
Don't flatter yourself.
You're nowhere near that powerful.

07:38.560 --> 07:40.040
And it was only the east wing.

07:40.240 --> 07:41.800
[indistinct chatter]

07:41.880 --> 07:42.720
Here.

07:43.160 --> 07:45.520
-Thanks for catching it.
-With your face.

07:51.480 --> 07:53.160
Haven't even started my project.

07:53.480 --> 07:54.320
Have to wing it.

07:54.920 --> 07:56.960
I've researched this really crafty spell.

07:57.080 --> 07:59.680
Took most of the holidays to get it
working. I'm proud.

08:00.040 --> 08:00.880
Let's see.

08:01.360 --> 08:04.880
No, I want to surprise you in class.
It'll be worth the wait, I promise.

08:07.760 --> 08:08.600
[Cackle sighs]

08:09.000 --> 08:13.560
Leftover bad magic from Agatha's
annihilation spell last term.

08:17.120 --> 08:18.680
But we reversed it.

08:19.160 --> 08:21.520
Traces were hidden deep in the walls.

08:22.280 --> 08:24.480
The flagpole coming out
caused a chain reaction.

08:25.000 --> 08:27.840
Thank goodness
for Mildred's aerial predicament.

08:28.120 --> 08:32.039
Indeed. It could have spread through
the entire school if left unchecked.

08:32.280 --> 08:35.679
We'll have to remove it, stone by stone.

08:36.400 --> 08:38.080
We can't rebuild until it's gone.

08:38.159 --> 08:40.159
Space will be tight for a while.

08:40.520 --> 08:41.600
But we'll manage.

08:42.080 --> 08:44.600
Keep calm and witch on.

08:45.480 --> 08:47.880
[door opens]

08:48.000 --> 08:50.720
Sybil Hallow? They've got us in with you.

08:51.040 --> 08:52.760
Our bedrooms were annihilated.

08:55.240 --> 08:56.200
Well met.

08:57.080 --> 08:58.760
She's Clarice, I'm Beatrice.

08:58.840 --> 09:00.880
-You can call me Bea.
-Call me Clarice.

09:01.720 --> 09:04.120
She's weird, but nice. Don't worry.

09:05.840 --> 09:07.840
You're head of Year One, aren't you?

09:08.880 --> 09:10.520
-Congrats.
-Thanks.

09:11.400 --> 09:14.320
Is Esmerelda Hallow your big sister?

09:14.720 --> 09:16.200
You've heard about her?

09:16.720 --> 09:18.400
People are saying she lost her magic.

09:18.880 --> 09:20.840
She didn't lose it,

09:21.280 --> 09:25.040
she was tricked into giving it away
and then she couldn't get it back.

09:25.680 --> 09:26.960
-[stammers]
-Are you okay?

09:28.280 --> 09:31.560
Just now my other sister got knocked
clean off her broom

09:31.760 --> 09:33.560
and then the school fell down.

09:33.640 --> 09:35.200
She's not okay.

09:36.560 --> 09:38.360
This place is really scary.

09:38.920 --> 09:39.760
Go home, then.

09:40.040 --> 09:42.760
I can't. My mum's even scarier.

09:43.200 --> 09:45.880
I guess I just have to stay here
and be brave.

09:46.800 --> 09:48.160
I think I can help with that.

09:49.840 --> 09:51.840
[birds chirping]

10:02.240 --> 10:03.320
Hmm.

10:03.400 --> 10:05.160
Don't reckon much to the view.

10:05.240 --> 10:06.120
Shh!

10:06.200 --> 10:08.080
Pets are banned, remember?

10:08.320 --> 10:09.560
I have to hide you.

10:10.080 --> 10:12.200
Not one more word
until I present my project.

10:12.440 --> 10:13.440
No problemo.

10:13.680 --> 10:14.600
Einstein.

10:14.680 --> 10:16.320
Sorry! Last one.

10:16.640 --> 10:17.480
Oh!

10:17.560 --> 10:18.840
-That was another.
-Shh.

10:18.920 --> 10:20.240
Sorry.

10:27.880 --> 10:29.880
Everyone's talking about Esmerelda.

10:30.360 --> 10:32.480
Is it true she's not magic anymore?

10:33.320 --> 10:37.040
-Mother told us not to say anything.
-But she isn't coming back?

10:37.520 --> 10:38.760
Not for now, no.

10:39.560 --> 10:43.120
Must be strange,
especially with Drusilla changing schools.

10:43.680 --> 10:45.760
I heard she's at Pentangle's now.

10:46.040 --> 10:48.280
[girl] Really? She's so lucky.

10:48.760 --> 10:51.720
I know, right?
Ms. Pentangle is everything.

10:53.200 --> 10:54.040
Oh, no!

10:55.920 --> 10:57.360
Oh, foaming frogspawn!

10:57.960 --> 10:58.840
No!

10:59.000 --> 11:01.720
-What?
-My holiday project for HB.

11:02.360 --> 11:03.280
It's not here!

11:05.120 --> 11:07.040
[crows croaking]

11:08.160 --> 11:11.920
-Tell me how it happened again.
-Hide and seek with my cousin Henry.

11:12.000 --> 11:14.480
Magical hide and seek is epic!

11:14.680 --> 11:16.440
Which means things can go wrong.

11:16.960 --> 11:19.240
I thought he'd never find me
with a different face.

11:20.360 --> 11:23.200
I'm still me... underneath.

11:23.640 --> 11:26.000
Obviously. I'd know you anywhere.

11:26.480 --> 11:28.600
You didn't change anything
over the holidays?

11:28.680 --> 11:31.520
No, I just went on a world tour
with Mum and Dad!

11:31.600 --> 11:34.040
-Mm!
-It was like watching pondweed dry.

11:34.120 --> 11:37.040
-[chuckles]
-We visited the Natural Witchery Museum.

11:37.280 --> 11:38.600
Very educational.

11:38.680 --> 11:41.600
Followed by a broomstick water-skiing trip
over Niagara Falls.

11:41.680 --> 11:43.160
-Nice.
-What about you?

11:43.640 --> 11:44.640
Caravan holiday.

11:45.400 --> 11:48.320
As in camels across the Sahara?

11:48.840 --> 11:51.200
As in Wales across the A48.

11:52.240 --> 11:53.240
Really?

11:53.520 --> 11:55.480
-How did you get there?
-On a bus.

11:55.600 --> 11:57.120
An actual bus?

11:57.200 --> 12:00.280
Yep, just a normal actual bus.

12:00.600 --> 12:03.400
That settles it.
Next break, we're staying with you.

12:03.480 --> 12:04.320
[all chuckling]

12:07.160 --> 12:10.120
My dad made it.
Helps boost your confidence.

12:11.800 --> 12:15.480
Hallows aren't supposed
to need help with things.

12:15.560 --> 12:17.120
Everyone does sometimes.

12:22.560 --> 12:24.160
You didn't pack my project!

12:24.240 --> 12:25.280
Hello, I'm Bea--

12:25.360 --> 12:28.240
I told you to get the folder
next to Mum's cauldron

12:28.320 --> 12:29.600
and put it in my trunk.

12:29.680 --> 12:31.480
Can't your mum just transfer it?

12:31.600 --> 12:34.280
Tell her we left it behind?
Are you insane?

12:34.840 --> 12:36.120
Sybil, have you any idea

12:36.200 --> 12:38.840
what HB's going do to me
when I turn up without my--

12:38.920 --> 12:41.200
<i>You </i> left it behind.

12:41.440 --> 12:42.600
Excuse me?

12:43.280 --> 12:44.960
I packed it in your trunk.

12:45.200 --> 12:48.560
You took it out again and you decided
my packing wasn't neat enough.

12:48.800 --> 12:51.040
If you forgot it, that's your fault.

12:52.520 --> 12:53.600
[scoffs]

12:55.520 --> 12:57.200
Did I really just say that?

12:57.440 --> 13:00.040
Your father makes excellent potions.

13:03.160 --> 13:05.680
<i>So, you got off to a sticky start.</i>

13:06.800 --> 13:08.800
<i>Sounds like your flying</i>
<i>was on point, though.</i>

13:09.000 --> 13:11.080
Enid and Maud were super impressed.

13:11.400 --> 13:14.000
<i>Told you all those hours</i>
<i>we put in would be worth it.</i>

13:14.360 --> 13:15.200
Thanks, Mum.

13:15.760 --> 13:18.440
<i>-And are you ready for your project?</i>
-Can't wait.

13:18.520 --> 13:21.400
I've made extra in case
people want to give it a try themselves.

13:21.880 --> 13:24.800
<i>Nobody's gonna be talking</i>
<i>about the school falling down, then.</i>

13:25.160 --> 13:26.000
You think?

13:28.720 --> 13:32.600
[Einstein] Come on, Tabby.
You can get into the kitchen easy.

13:41.000 --> 13:43.760
Go on, Tabby, be a sport.

13:44.280 --> 13:45.800
Grab us a bit of cabbage.

13:46.600 --> 13:47.520
Maybe a carrot.

13:48.200 --> 13:49.520
No one would miss it.

13:52.280 --> 13:53.560
Come on, Tabby.

14:02.080 --> 14:03.120
Hello!

14:03.880 --> 14:05.280
Got any food on you?

14:06.360 --> 14:07.360
Oops.

14:07.440 --> 14:09.960
Forget I said that, and that.

14:10.880 --> 14:11.960
Mildred's spell.

14:13.640 --> 14:14.680
It worked.

14:16.000 --> 14:17.120
[Einstein] Uh-oh.

14:17.880 --> 14:19.440
[bell ringing]

14:21.320 --> 14:23.560
[indistinct chatter]

14:25.440 --> 14:27.440
[Mildred] Wait, Maud, are you going first?

14:27.720 --> 14:28.560
I don't know.

14:29.520 --> 14:30.360
Are you?

14:30.960 --> 14:33.560
-Aren't you worried about winging it?
-No.

14:34.000 --> 14:37.640
Not being able to think of something
made me think of something.

14:39.720 --> 14:40.800
Silence!

14:41.120 --> 14:42.120
[chatter stops]

14:42.280 --> 14:44.520
-[water boiling]
-[crows croaking]

14:46.920 --> 14:49.800
You will each present your project.

14:50.000 --> 14:55.280
Marks are awarded for originality,
flair, and difficulty.

14:56.400 --> 15:01.920
The highest-scoring witch
wins a prize of my choosing.

15:03.880 --> 15:04.720
Begin.

15:10.840 --> 15:13.600
Okay, so my project is all about...

15:17.200 --> 15:19.800
How to get your brain fizzing
when you haven't got a clue.

15:21.080 --> 15:24.560
Why just have one hair colour
when you can have every hair colour?

15:24.640 --> 15:26.880
You simply sprinkle the potion
like this...

15:29.680 --> 15:31.960
Tap your head like this.

15:32.400 --> 15:34.840
Chant the words
at the top of your voice and...

15:35.040 --> 15:38.000
A convenient portable broomstick
for any occasion.

15:41.640 --> 15:43.760
You get the perfect idea every time.

15:45.760 --> 15:46.800
Rainbow hair!

15:46.880 --> 15:48.120
[applause]

15:52.400 --> 15:53.920
Next.

15:56.760 --> 15:59.800
I'd like to share a very important
magical breakthrough,

15:59.920 --> 16:03.320
which I, Ethel Hallow,
discovered during my extensive research

16:03.400 --> 16:04.480
over the holidays.

16:04.920 --> 16:06.160
Meet Cyril, everyone.

16:06.760 --> 16:08.480
Pleased to make your acquaintance.

16:08.640 --> 16:09.840
-[all gasping]
-[girl] Wow!

16:10.400 --> 16:11.800
That's amazing!

16:21.160 --> 16:22.000
[meowing]

16:26.200 --> 16:27.680
Glad I didn't miss this.

16:27.760 --> 16:30.320
Nothing scary about getting a cat.

16:30.800 --> 16:33.040
Nope, not one thing.

16:37.120 --> 16:39.120
[cats meowing]

16:44.840 --> 16:45.960
[sneezes]

16:48.080 --> 16:50.320
You have to be precise
with the talking equation.

16:50.400 --> 16:53.280
-Ms. Hardbroom!
-No questions till Ethel's finished.

16:53.360 --> 16:56.600
Once you've worked out
the potion-to-surface-area ratio, however,

16:56.840 --> 16:59.040
it should work on almost any small animal.

16:59.240 --> 17:00.560
Don't see why not.

17:00.800 --> 17:02.120
Ms. Hardbroom!

17:02.440 --> 17:05.599
That really is a fascinating discovery,
Ethel.

17:05.680 --> 17:08.040
-Ms. Hardbroom!
-Yes, Mildred?

17:08.119 --> 17:09.520
That's my spell!

17:14.960 --> 17:16.680
Bea vanished into thin air.

17:17.680 --> 17:20.839
I'm not afraid of that.
Witches vanish all the time.

17:21.280 --> 17:22.839
Not first-years, though.

17:23.040 --> 17:25.920
-So you're scared now?
-I just think we should go and find her.

17:26.960 --> 17:30.880
[Mildred] Ethel must have stolen it!
I can prove it, Ms. Hardbroom. Look!

17:33.320 --> 17:36.840
I had hoped
you'd be taking this year seriously.

17:38.480 --> 17:42.600
Clearly, some things never change.

17:42.680 --> 17:45.520
But there was a whole project in there.
I swear it!

17:45.880 --> 17:49.120
And I made Einstein talk.
He'll tell you himself!

17:54.920 --> 17:56.960
She stole my tortoise, too.

17:57.320 --> 18:00.840
You brought a pet tortoise to school?
Isn't that against the rules?

18:00.920 --> 18:02.960
Mildred Hubble,
if this is an attempt

18:03.040 --> 18:05.600
to cover up the fact
that you haven't done the work--

18:05.680 --> 18:07.280
I did it. I promise.

18:07.680 --> 18:11.440
And Einstein wasn't a pet,
he was part of my project.

18:11.520 --> 18:12.640
[Hardbroom] Mildred.

18:13.080 --> 18:15.000
Cast the spell. Prove it.

18:16.840 --> 18:18.680
Perhaps if I could show you...

18:20.720 --> 18:24.440
<i>Pitter-patter, chitter-chatter,</i>
<i>oink or gobble, wink and natter,</i>

18:24.520 --> 18:27.840
<i>croak me out, bark or tweet,</i>
<i>you were silent, now you speak!</i>

18:29.640 --> 18:31.640
[crows croaking]

18:34.120 --> 18:36.560
[snail] Oh, I wish they'd
keep the noise down.

18:36.640 --> 18:38.360
I was having a snooze.

18:39.000 --> 18:40.440
Sid, I think they heard you.

18:40.680 --> 18:41.920
No, they didn't.

18:42.240 --> 18:44.440
We did, actually.

18:46.400 --> 18:50.200
Wow, hello.
Could you let me out of this jar, please?

18:51.360 --> 18:53.120
Yes! What she said.

18:53.200 --> 18:56.040
Save us from HB. She's a monster!

18:56.120 --> 18:57.600
[girls laughing]

18:58.480 --> 18:59.560
[laughter stops]

19:01.360 --> 19:02.200
Bea!

19:04.280 --> 19:06.240
Bea, come out, wherever you are!

19:06.920 --> 19:09.280
-Bea!
-[Einstein] Hello!

19:09.560 --> 19:11.480
Hello down there!

19:11.840 --> 19:13.080
Help!

19:13.440 --> 19:14.280
Hello?

19:14.560 --> 19:16.440
I think I've been kidnapped!

19:16.920 --> 19:18.920
Any chance you could get me down?

19:23.200 --> 19:25.720
[indistinct chatter]

19:29.920 --> 19:31.760
Okay, Einstein was never that loud.

19:31.840 --> 19:34.000
-I'm not sure what went wrong.
-[chatter stops]

19:34.760 --> 19:37.360
You used magic in anger.

19:37.800 --> 19:39.160
That's what went wrong.

19:39.480 --> 19:40.720
Sorry, Ms. Hardbroom.

19:40.960 --> 19:42.960
However, you have proven yourself...

19:44.080 --> 19:47.520
as the girl who attempted
to copy Ethel's project.

19:48.000 --> 19:50.680
Ms. Cackle will decide
what to do with you.

20:00.480 --> 20:01.600
[stones thudding]

20:13.920 --> 20:16.480
[grunting]

20:16.560 --> 20:20.320
No offense,
but you look a little unbalanced.

20:21.040 --> 20:22.160
I'm a first-year.

20:22.880 --> 20:24.000
Still learning.

20:24.640 --> 20:25.880
[Einstein] Ooh! Careful.

20:26.560 --> 20:27.400
Hello.

20:29.520 --> 20:30.360
Hello.

20:30.880 --> 20:33.160
Oh, you found us.

20:33.400 --> 20:35.520
It was supposed to be
the other way around.

20:35.640 --> 20:39.440
I heard you looking,
but I was embarrassed.

20:39.520 --> 20:41.880
I've got... asthma.

20:41.960 --> 20:44.440
It transfers me around sometimes
when it gets bad.

20:46.640 --> 20:49.760
-What's she doing up there?
-[Clarice] Just rescuing a tortoise.

20:50.160 --> 20:52.120
She's fearless now, thanks to you.

20:56.360 --> 20:59.000
Cheating is a very serious allegation.

20:59.080 --> 21:01.840
I swear on Tabby's life, I didn't do it.

21:03.280 --> 21:06.880
We shall have to talk to both of you,
see if we can't get to the bottom of it.

21:07.400 --> 21:08.240
Come on.

21:09.200 --> 21:11.720
[crows croaking]

21:15.240 --> 21:20.720
Well, knock me down with a lily pad!

21:24.320 --> 21:27.200
Whatever did you land on?

21:30.080 --> 21:30.920
Mildred?

21:35.480 --> 21:39.720
For the most imaginative
and unusual holiday project,

21:40.120 --> 21:43.120
I declare Ethel Hallow the winner.

21:43.200 --> 21:44.320
[scattered applause]

21:44.400 --> 21:45.560
[Cyril] Congratulations.

21:48.160 --> 21:49.840
[whispers] This is so unfair.

21:50.000 --> 21:51.120
What are we gonna do?

21:56.240 --> 21:57.880
[electricity buzzes, zaps]

21:59.160 --> 22:00.760
We need to find that tortoise.

22:01.480 --> 22:03.560
I never thought I'd see the day.

22:04.440 --> 22:05.840
What is it, Ms. Cackle?

22:06.880 --> 22:11.000
Something very special indeed!

22:13.000 --> 22:17.080
-Do you disappear every time you sneeze?
-Yes, unfortunately.

22:18.040 --> 22:19.400
Well, we covered for you.

22:20.520 --> 22:22.560
Broomsticks crossed, no one missed us.

22:22.640 --> 22:24.360
But what if it happens again?

22:24.920 --> 22:28.080
You can't just keep disappearing
at the drop of a hat.

22:32.440 --> 22:33.480
Hand it over.

22:33.920 --> 22:34.760
What?

22:35.000 --> 22:37.360
You know what. We used a tracking spell.

22:38.200 --> 22:40.160
[Einstein] I think she means me.

22:44.440 --> 22:46.640
Busted tortoise-handed.

22:47.120 --> 22:48.520
[Einstein] Oh, dear.

22:52.560 --> 22:53.400
Ms. Cackle!

22:56.000 --> 22:57.760
[indistinct chatter]

23:03.200 --> 23:04.520
[Maud] What's happened now?

23:04.600 --> 23:06.960
[Felicity] They found something awesome
in the ruins.

23:10.160 --> 23:13.000
So the second-years hate us now.

23:13.080 --> 23:15.040
For helping a defenceless animal?

23:15.640 --> 23:18.360
They might think
I was in on it with Ethel.

23:18.440 --> 23:19.520
But you weren't.

23:21.240 --> 23:23.360
Can I have some more
of your confidence potion?

23:24.040 --> 23:25.720
Actually, I made that.

23:26.680 --> 23:28.520
Really? What was in it?

23:29.560 --> 23:30.400
Water.

23:30.880 --> 23:31.840
Magic water?

23:32.200 --> 23:34.080
No, just water-water.

23:36.520 --> 23:38.200
I stood up to my sister.

23:38.600 --> 23:39.440
Yep.

23:39.760 --> 23:44.520
I flew to the top of the tallest tree
I've... ever seen.

23:45.000 --> 23:48.560
Yes, and you didn't need magic
to do any of it.

23:48.640 --> 23:50.120
You did it all by yourself.

23:50.200 --> 23:51.280
Isn't that amazing?

23:52.640 --> 23:54.200
-No.
-No?

23:54.920 --> 23:58.920
No, it's not amazing, it's petrifying.

23:59.240 --> 24:01.720
I-- I could have been seriously hurt.

24:04.160 --> 24:06.560
Come closer, everyone!

24:08.000 --> 24:09.520
[chuckles] That's it!

24:10.480 --> 24:13.840
[sighs] I'd like to present to you all...

24:15.280 --> 24:17.840
the founding stone of the school.

24:18.400 --> 24:21.680
[Hardbroom] Set down
by the first Ms. Cackle centuries ago,

24:22.000 --> 24:23.640
when the school was built.

24:23.920 --> 24:26.560
It's what makes a magical school magical.

24:26.920 --> 24:28.320
The collapse revealed it.

24:28.400 --> 24:31.280
No living person has ever seen one before!

24:31.960 --> 24:33.600
Doesn't look all that to me.

24:34.000 --> 24:38.360
This stone is a source of great power
and it deserves your respect.

24:38.720 --> 24:40.480
Who said that?

24:41.480 --> 24:43.280
[Einstein] Um, I did.

24:44.000 --> 24:49.720
Maud Spellbody, is that a tortoise?

24:50.720 --> 24:52.600
Yes, Ms. Hardbroom.

24:53.480 --> 24:54.880
A talking one.

25:00.880 --> 25:02.880
She snatched me from under the bed,

25:03.640 --> 25:06.480
used a spell to copy Mildred's project,

25:07.280 --> 25:09.320
and dumped it in the kitchen bin.

25:09.960 --> 25:14.600
Then she flew out to the woods
and hid me in a tree.

25:15.640 --> 25:17.240
Is this true?

25:17.880 --> 25:21.040
No, Ms. Hardbroom.
And you can't take his word for it.

25:21.400 --> 25:23.800
-He's a tortoise.
-You do have a point.

25:24.840 --> 25:28.000
Which is why we're going to pay
a visit to the bins.

25:32.040 --> 25:34.040
Keep looking, Ethel.

25:34.400 --> 25:36.960
You're going to turn over
every old teabag and fish skin

25:37.040 --> 25:40.120
-until we have a definitive answer.
-I can see it, right at the back.

25:40.200 --> 25:41.040
-Look!
-There!

25:41.520 --> 25:43.720
There it is!
I can tell from the green ink.

25:47.960 --> 25:49.240
[Cackle clicks her tongue]

25:50.560 --> 25:52.000
[sighs] I'm sorry.

25:52.640 --> 25:56.560
I did my own and it was excellent,
but I forgot it.

25:57.320 --> 26:01.200
I didn't want my mother to find out
because she's been so worried about Esme.

26:03.520 --> 26:06.320
We have a zero-tolerance approach
to plagiarism.

26:07.040 --> 26:10.160
Rest assured
she will be punished, Mildred.

26:15.040 --> 26:16.200
How many lines?

26:18.000 --> 26:21.800
Two hundred and fifty thousand,
to start off with.

26:22.400 --> 26:24.480
-You made him speak.
-Chop, chop!

26:25.840 --> 26:28.680
"I must not steal other people's ideas."

26:30.360 --> 26:32.600
[Cyril] Best handwriting. Begin.

26:33.520 --> 26:35.800
-[all laughing]
-You should have seen Ethel.

26:36.000 --> 26:39.560
Covered in bin juice,
face like she'd eaten mouldy porridge.

26:39.640 --> 26:40.600
[chuckling]

26:40.880 --> 26:41.840
[Enid gasps]

26:42.920 --> 26:46.200
Your prize: toadstools in crow saliva.

26:46.440 --> 26:47.840
Use them sparingly.

26:48.280 --> 26:49.120
I won?

26:49.960 --> 26:52.080
[clicks tongue] I remarked
the holiday projects

26:52.160 --> 26:53.680
in light of recent events.

26:53.760 --> 26:57.200
-So, yes, you are now...
-[Maud gasps]

27:00.000 --> 27:00.840
the winner.

27:01.280 --> 27:04.520
-Yes!
-[whispers] Do not let it go to your head.

27:07.600 --> 27:09.360
We're so proud of you, Mil!

27:09.760 --> 27:11.520
I'm just proud of Einstein.

27:12.040 --> 27:13.480
Shame he has to go home.

27:14.200 --> 27:16.400
I think I'll like it better there.

27:17.000 --> 27:20.680
-This school is a bit too exciting for me.
-[giggles]

27:22.320 --> 27:24.640
But have a brilliant term, Mildred.

27:25.400 --> 27:27.800
You know what? I think I might.

27:28.440 --> 27:29.800
[Einstein chuckles]
