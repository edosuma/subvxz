WEBVTT

00:06.131 --> 00:07.466
(HIGH-PITCHED) Whoa.

00:09.760 --> 00:13.889
Look who's come
crawling back
to beg for his job.

00:14.014 --> 00:15.724
Neither crawling
nor begging.

00:15.850 --> 00:17.935
Just retrieving
the last of my things.

00:18.059 --> 00:19.728
Oh, and you just happen
to be retrieving it all

00:19.854 --> 00:21.313
the exact moment
I always come in to work?

00:21.438 --> 00:22.523
I've never seen you
in the office before noon.

00:24.441 --> 00:25.400
Before noon?
What time is it?

00:25.526 --> 00:26.401
8:00.
O'clock?

00:28.445 --> 00:29.697
Anyway, listen.
I've thought about it.

00:29.822 --> 00:30.656
I'm willing
to take you back.

00:30.781 --> 00:32.491
I mean, who even remembers

00:32.616 --> 00:34.368
why you left
in the first place?

00:34.493 --> 00:35.285
I do.

00:37.204 --> 00:38.789
Under the guise
of a flu shot,

00:38.914 --> 00:41.000
you implanted
a GPS tracking chip
into my arm.

00:43.084 --> 00:44.211
Are we still talking
about this?

00:44.336 --> 00:45.170
It was a week ago.

00:46.714 --> 00:48.465
No matter.

00:48.590 --> 00:50.718
I have a new job,
which I also happen to love.

00:50.843 --> 00:52.887
Oh, yeah.
What's this gig again?

00:53.012 --> 00:54.596
You're a, uh,
call center operator?

00:56.515 --> 00:57.474
Street urchin?
Hmm.

00:58.350 --> 00:59.267
Snake charmer?

01:00.769 --> 01:01.770
Are you fin...
Magic carpet repairman?

01:04.147 --> 01:06.191
I am assistant
to Mr. William Charles,

01:06.316 --> 01:07.693
president of
one of New York's

01:07.818 --> 01:08.903
premier commercial
real estate firms,

01:09.028 --> 01:10.571
and I will
have you know, sir,

01:10.696 --> 01:12.364
I have already
learned more there

01:12.489 --> 01:13.323
than I did
in five years here.

01:15.242 --> 01:18.078
Well, a teacher's only
as good as his student.

01:18.203 --> 01:20.915
So you have
nothing else to say?

01:21.040 --> 01:22.416
Because when I walk
out that door,

01:22.541 --> 01:24.459
I will never set foot
in this office again.

01:25.920 --> 01:26.712
Sounds good.

01:28.422 --> 01:30.549
Typical.

01:30.674 --> 01:31.550
I'd be a fool
to expect anything more.

01:32.885 --> 01:33.594
Timmy, wait.

01:35.930 --> 01:36.722
There is something.

01:36.847 --> 01:38.557
Yes?

01:38.682 --> 01:40.059
Have you seen
my "no fat chicks" sign?

01:41.894 --> 01:42.895
I haven't, no.

01:45.064 --> 01:46.815
Perhaps one of
the full-figured gals
ate it.

01:53.530 --> 01:55.574
♪ How many ways
to say I love you?

01:58.744 --> 02:02.998
♪ How many ways
to say that I'm not scared?

02:03.123 --> 02:08.003
♪ With you by my side
There is no denying

02:08.128 --> 02:10.047
♪ I can't wait
for me and you ♪

02:19.765 --> 02:20.682
God, you are humongous.

02:20.808 --> 02:21.809
When is this baby due?

02:24.770 --> 02:26.605
Two and a half weeks.
When is your mustache due?

02:29.942 --> 02:31.819
Hey, Jeff,
will you please
pass the salt?

02:31.944 --> 02:32.611
Oh, sure.
Here you go.

02:35.238 --> 02:36.323
You've got
to meet me halfway.

02:38.826 --> 02:39.868
Jeff, just give it to her.
This is as far
as I can push it.

02:39.994 --> 02:42.579
Just give it.
Oh.

02:42.704 --> 02:44.205
Why do you have
to taunt the woman
who's carrying our baby?

02:44.331 --> 02:45.290
Because you won't.

02:47.876 --> 02:48.627
Somebody's got
to represent.

02:50.712 --> 02:51.839
Will you hurry up
and have this kid?

02:51.964 --> 02:52.798
I want the attention
back to me.

02:54.215 --> 02:55.509
Trust me, I can't wait.

02:55.634 --> 02:57.886
I can't even
bend over anymore.

02:58.012 --> 02:59.763
You know, the other day
in the subway,
I dropped my bag.

02:59.888 --> 03:00.722
I just left it there.

03:02.432 --> 03:04.518
Anyway, you want
to hear the worst part?
ALL: Mmm-hmm.

03:04.643 --> 03:05.644
If I laugh too hard, I pee.

03:07.479 --> 03:09.898
Uh, wait a second.
You've been
wetting your pants?

03:10.024 --> 03:11.900
No, it's...
It's perfectly normal.

03:12.026 --> 03:13.192
Yeah, if you're 11.

03:15.863 --> 03:16.780
Four?

03:18.490 --> 03:20.325
Yeah, it only
happened once,

03:20.450 --> 03:22.703
and so I've just decided
to avoid anything funny.

03:22.828 --> 03:23.787
Hence this booth.

03:24.538 --> 03:26.247
(LAUGHING)

03:26.373 --> 03:27.624
Audrey, come on.
We should get going.

03:27.749 --> 03:29.710
We don't want to be late
for the movie.

03:29.835 --> 03:31.628
The movie doesn't
start for an hour.
It's only three blocks away.

03:31.753 --> 03:32.671
Yeah, I know.
We're going to be
cutting it pretty close.

03:34.006 --> 03:34.965
Okay. I see what you mean.

03:35.090 --> 03:36.842
I'll be home
around 10:00.

03:36.967 --> 03:40.512
Oh, this is
the best thing ever.

03:40.637 --> 03:42.848
(SCOFFS) Audrey's only
going to be gone
a couple hours.

03:42.973 --> 03:43.640
You must really
not like your wife.

03:45.266 --> 03:46.518
Nah, I love
the feisty broad.

03:46.643 --> 03:47.352
I'm talking about Brenda.

03:48.187 --> 03:49.104
When she laughs,

03:49.855 --> 03:51.065
she...she pees.

03:53.400 --> 03:54.609
So if I can
make her laugh,

03:56.236 --> 03:57.071
maybe she'll pee herself.

03:58.446 --> 03:59.781
Then what?

03:59.907 --> 04:00.824
Well, like there needs
to be more?

04:00.949 --> 04:02.283
That's the whole thing.

04:02.409 --> 04:04.161
You know, I'd help,

04:04.285 --> 04:05.996
but I've got interviews
set up for Timmy's
replacement.

04:06.121 --> 04:07.039
He's really not
coming back, huh?

04:07.164 --> 04:08.248
Oh, he wants to.

04:09.332 --> 04:10.959
Came by a couple weeks ago.

04:11.085 --> 04:12.211
"Hey, can I
have my job back?"

04:12.335 --> 04:14.213
I'm like, "No".

04:14.337 --> 04:16.131
And he's like,
"Please, sir, I'm begging."

04:22.846 --> 04:23.889
(SINGSONG) Jen.

04:26.808 --> 04:28.185
We're getting married
tonight.

04:30.353 --> 04:33.190
Oh, that's such
a romantic way
to wake me up.

04:33.314 --> 04:34.900
Romantic?

04:35.025 --> 04:36.317
Honey, you know
my voice gets
all singsongy

04:36.443 --> 04:37.444
when I get nervous.

04:39.696 --> 04:41.156
Now, now, get up. Get up.

04:41.281 --> 04:42.991
We have a million things
to do.

04:43.117 --> 04:45.619
Adam, everything's gonna
be fine, okay?

04:45.744 --> 04:47.537
It's all under control.
Under control?

04:47.662 --> 04:49.206
Oh, no.
We've got to work out
the seating chart,

04:49.330 --> 04:50.874
then I've got
to pick up my suit
from the dry cleaner's,

04:50.999 --> 04:52.292
and if you think
I'm done choreographing
our first dance,

04:52.417 --> 04:53.252
you're insane.
Ugh.

04:55.003 --> 04:59.174
Look, it's all
taken care of, okay?

04:59.299 --> 05:01.468
(CLEARING THROAT)
We planned a simple,
small get-together

05:01.593 --> 05:03.386
to avoid all the usual
wedding craziness.

05:03.511 --> 05:06.306
So just calm down, okay?

05:06.431 --> 05:08.016
If you get nervous,
you're gonna
make me nervous.

05:08.142 --> 05:10.435
Okay. I hear you,
I hear you.

05:10.560 --> 05:12.104
But I have barely
scratched the surface
of my to-do list.

05:13.772 --> 05:15.690
To-do list?

05:15.816 --> 05:17.651
"Add hydrangeas
to centerpieces?"
Can we?

05:17.776 --> 05:18.902
It's unseasonably warm.
I don't know.

05:21.321 --> 05:22.614
"Invent signature
wedding cocktail?"

05:22.739 --> 05:23.907
Already got the name.

05:24.032 --> 05:24.950
The "Jadam".

05:27.244 --> 05:29.871
Train Mambo
to be ring bearer."

05:29.997 --> 05:31.165
We are not
having your bird
be the ring bearer.

05:33.250 --> 05:34.168
He is your bird too.

05:36.670 --> 05:37.963
Come on,

05:38.088 --> 05:39.965
just let me stay in bed
a while longer.

05:42.176 --> 05:43.802
Okay.

05:43.927 --> 05:45.637
Well, "Final premarital
intercourse" is on the list.

05:48.265 --> 05:49.766
All right, look.
We've got
to multi-task, okay?

05:49.891 --> 05:51.643
So while we're doing it,

05:51.768 --> 05:53.228
you've gotta
think of garnishes
for the "Jadam."

05:53.352 --> 05:55.022
Ugh.
Ow! Hey.

06:00.819 --> 06:03.655
(SIGHS) Jeff, Jen and I
are going to get
wedding day massages.

06:03.780 --> 06:06.116
Did you do something
with my purse?

06:06.241 --> 06:07.492
Yeah, I took it
to work yesterday.

06:10.453 --> 06:11.538
Really made my outfit pop.

06:13.623 --> 06:15.709
Ha, ha.

06:15.834 --> 06:16.584
Just go back
to reading your book.

06:18.962 --> 06:20.130
Wait, you're reading a book?

06:23.258 --> 06:24.218
Yeah, it's a joke book.
Guess why.

06:25.177 --> 06:27.721
Something stupid?

06:27.846 --> 06:29.306
I'm gonna try to make
Brenda laugh so hard

06:29.430 --> 06:30.057
that she pees
in her underpants.

06:32.851 --> 06:34.853
Why on earth
would you do that?

06:34.978 --> 06:37.064
'Cause I don't want
to be the guy

06:37.189 --> 06:38.690
who could have
made my friend
pee in her pants

06:39.649 --> 06:40.692
and didn't.

06:41.693 --> 06:42.819
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

06:46.156 --> 06:47.532
Aha, there she is.

06:47.657 --> 06:49.450
Big day. You nervous?

06:49.576 --> 06:51.286
Yes, but only because
Adam's driving me crazy.

06:51.410 --> 06:53.372
Oh, Mambo?

06:53.496 --> 06:55.749
Oh, no, it's gone
way beyond
just bird stuff.

06:55.874 --> 06:58.417
(LAUGHING) Okay,
let's get you to the spa
for some relaxation.

06:58.543 --> 06:59.878
Here's the thing.

07:00.003 --> 07:01.338
It would relax me
a lot more

07:01.462 --> 07:02.923
if you would just take
Adam instead.

07:03.048 --> 07:04.299
Are you sure? Why?

07:04.423 --> 07:05.967
Because if he's
getting a massage,

07:06.093 --> 07:07.552
he's not ruining
our wedding.

07:07.677 --> 07:09.428
I don't want
to come home to find

07:09.554 --> 07:09.846
that I'm being walked
down the aisle by Mambo.

07:11.806 --> 07:14.809
Honey, my goal
is to relax you.

07:14.935 --> 07:16.228
So if this does it, fine.
Yeah, I'll take Adam.

07:18.730 --> 07:19.898
Hey, hey.

07:20.023 --> 07:21.316
Which tux for Mambo, okay?

07:23.902 --> 07:26.113
I'm thinking this one
if he's a guest,

07:26.238 --> 07:27.155
and this one
if he's walking you
down the aisle.

07:35.122 --> 07:35.747
Good morning, Timir.

07:36.623 --> 07:37.832
Ah, good morning, sir.

07:37.958 --> 07:39.042
Your daily schedule
is on your desk,

07:39.167 --> 07:40.835
as are your phone messages.

07:40.961 --> 07:43.463
Oh, and as I have a wedding
to attend this evening,

07:43.588 --> 07:46.466
I was wondering
if it'd be all right
if I left at 5:00?

07:46.591 --> 07:47.759
Well, yes, that's when
the workday ends, anyway.

07:48.676 --> 07:49.970
It ends?
How refreshing.

07:51.846 --> 07:53.014
Did you receive
the details

07:53.140 --> 07:54.891
on tomorrow evening's
cocktail reception?

07:55.016 --> 07:56.768
I did. The reception
begins at 7:30,

07:56.893 --> 07:58.812
so I figured
we'd leave at 7:00.

07:58.937 --> 08:01.064
I thought perhaps
you'd need a wingman.

08:01.189 --> 08:02.732
You know, in case a lady
you're interested in
has an unpleasant friend.

08:03.817 --> 08:05.402
That won't be necessary.

08:05.526 --> 08:06.611
It's a business function.
I'm not there to meet women.

08:07.237 --> 08:08.529
Of course.

08:08.655 --> 08:10.157
Besides, you have
enough duties already.

08:10.282 --> 08:11.366
Ha. Duties.

08:12.533 --> 08:13.618
Pardon?
Pardon?

08:15.536 --> 08:17.372
Anyway, Timir,
you're doing a great job.

08:18.415 --> 08:20.125
I can't imagine
your old boss

08:20.250 --> 08:21.376
finding a better
replacement.
Mmm.

08:22.336 --> 08:24.921
Well, knowing him,

08:25.046 --> 08:28.508
I'm sure he's conducting
a thoroughly
professional search.

08:28.633 --> 08:31.428
Confucius say,
if you're gonna
be my new assistant,

08:31.552 --> 08:32.471
I'll be getting
my own cokes.

08:35.932 --> 08:37.517
Okay,  La bamba,

08:37.642 --> 08:39.436
I don't mind
the occasional siesta,

08:39.560 --> 08:41.104
but I don't want
your whole family

08:41.229 --> 08:41.646
moving into the office,
comprende?

08:46.567 --> 08:48.695
You brought the HR lady
with you, huh?

08:48.820 --> 08:49.737
I like that.
You're smart.

08:51.072 --> 08:51.823
All right,
welcome aboard.

08:53.700 --> 08:54.534
Thank you very much.

08:58.163 --> 08:58.830
All right, murder-ball,
let's get started.

09:02.125 --> 09:04.627
So the bartender says,

09:04.752 --> 09:06.921
"Lady, we don't even have
a mechanical bull."

09:09.674 --> 09:14.513
Yeah, yeah, that is by far
the best one.

09:14.637 --> 09:16.097
You know, still not
worth the cab ride
over here, but funny.

09:17.557 --> 09:18.475
It was. So, uh...

09:20.143 --> 09:20.935
Anything come out, or...

09:23.146 --> 09:24.272
What?

09:24.398 --> 09:26.525
You know...whiz-wise.

09:29.694 --> 09:32.739
Jeff, are you
actually trying
to make me pee myself?

09:34.615 --> 09:35.534
Yeah.

09:37.452 --> 09:39.287
All right.
Well, it's not gonna happen,

09:39.413 --> 09:40.997
'cause your corny jokes,
just not cutting it.

09:41.122 --> 09:42.832
Mmm. Well, that's okay,
because I got backup.

09:42.957 --> 09:43.833
Check out this video
right here.

09:46.545 --> 09:47.712
(PAINED GRUNT)
(LAUGHS)

09:47.837 --> 09:48.671
Ow!

09:49.964 --> 09:50.798
Right in the nuts.
Yeah.

09:51.591 --> 09:53.301
Ow.

09:53.427 --> 09:54.719
That guy
is not all right.
Yeah, no.

09:56.304 --> 09:57.138
Anything?

09:58.765 --> 10:00.934
No. And you realize that,
if anything were to happen,

10:01.059 --> 10:02.394
that I'm sitting
on your couch, right?

10:04.396 --> 10:05.480
Be worth it. Here.

10:06.940 --> 10:08.483

(PAINED GROANS)
(LAUGHS)

10:11.819 --> 10:12.946
It's the same thing.

10:14.739 --> 10:15.574
Different nuts.

10:23.373 --> 10:25.666
Oh, boy,
I cannot tell you

10:25.792 --> 10:27.001
how much I have been
looking forward to this.

10:27.127 --> 10:28.669
A nice, quiet hour.

10:28.795 --> 10:29.837
Why are there
two tables?

10:29.963 --> 10:31.798
I mean,
where is it written

10:31.923 --> 10:33.674
that a ring bearer
can't be a bird,
you know?

10:35.260 --> 10:36.553
Oh, hey, Audrey.

10:36.677 --> 10:38.388
Uh, why is he here?

10:38.513 --> 10:39.847
Your certificate was
for a couple's massage.

10:40.974 --> 10:42.601
Oh. I didn't realize.

10:42.725 --> 10:44.060
Well, we are not a couple,

10:44.185 --> 10:45.645
so we're gonna need
separate rooms.

10:45.770 --> 10:48.315
I'm sorry,
but every room
is booked today.

10:48.440 --> 10:51.526
Uh, okay, I'm...
I'm not sure this
is gonna work for me.

10:51.651 --> 10:53.069
Hey, come on.
Audrey, look.

10:53.194 --> 10:54.529
We're both
adults here, right?

10:54.654 --> 10:56.156
And we both
really need massages.

10:56.281 --> 10:57.282
It's only as uncomfortable
as we make it.

10:59.826 --> 11:01.536
Uh, yeah.

11:01.661 --> 11:03.330
I mean,
I guess you're...

11:03.455 --> 11:04.664
Naked.

11:04.789 --> 11:06.707
Um...
Come on.

11:07.501 --> 11:08.126
Let's get our rub on.

11:17.511 --> 11:19.012

11:19.137 --> 11:20.305

11:22.182 --> 11:23.391
Hi, Mr. Dunbar.

11:23.517 --> 11:25.101
I put your messages
on your desk.

11:25.226 --> 11:26.227
I was just about
to head to the men's room.

11:26.894 --> 11:27.854
Oh, boy.

11:29.481 --> 11:30.565

Mr. Dunbar?

11:47.248 --> 11:47.999
It's Timmy.

11:49.501 --> 11:51.545
Oh, I knew
a Timmy once.

11:51.670 --> 11:53.171
Mmm.

11:53.296 --> 11:55.131
Answering your own phone?

11:55.256 --> 11:56.216

a replacement for me?

11:58.176 --> 12:00.803
Oh, no, I found
a replacement in,
like, mmm, nine seconds.

12:02.472 --> 12:03.598
And he's really
hit the ground running.

12:06.184 --> 12:07.768
How are you
getting along with
your precious new boss?

12:07.894 --> 12:09.896
Oh, very well.

12:10.021 --> 12:13.650
He's all business,
very professional,
just as I wanted.

12:13.774 --> 12:14.859
Anyway, I'm merely calling
because I think

12:14.984 --> 12:16.361
I left my gray cardigan there.

12:17.237 --> 12:18.112
Have you seen it?

12:18.238 --> 12:19.738
Uh, no, I haven't.

12:19.864 --> 12:21.241
Now, if you'll excuse me,

of cool things to do

12:39.718 --> 12:40.843
I wish you didn't
quit me, Timmy.

at this moment,

12:49.018 --> 12:50.729
be overrun

they belong.

That's...that's good stuff
right there.

13:03.658 --> 13:05.452
Hey, thanks again
for this, Audrey.

13:05.577 --> 13:08.204
I mean, it is
so, so relaxing.

13:08.329 --> 13:09.581
You know,
I really needed this,

13:09.706 --> 13:11.207
because, to be honest,

13:11.332 --> 13:14.168
Jen's really getting
on my nerves
a little bit, so...

13:14.294 --> 13:16.296
I'm really happy
you're enjoying yourself.

13:16.421 --> 13:18.047
I prefer my massages
to be silent.

13:18.172 --> 13:19.466
I hear you loud and clear.

13:19.591 --> 13:21.593
Yeah, because when things
get quiet,

13:21.718 --> 13:23.010
that's really when
the other senses kick in.

in here.

with the greatest idea
for the wedding, right?

get in there.

to relax.

from, like, a long line
of masseuser-ers?

is much better.

He gives me a whole hour
for lunch.

15:27.301 --> 15:28.845
I could go to a museum,

15:28.969 --> 15:29.804

catch up on my reading.

are all so exciting.

but I don't really know
how this works.
