<i>Theorizing that one could time travel
within his own lifetime,</i>

00:05.739 --> 00:08.674
<i>Dr. Sam Beckett stepped
into the Quantum Leap accelerator...</i>

00:08.742 --> 00:10.733
<i>and vanished.</i>

00:15.949 --> 00:19.441
<i>He awoke to find himself
trapped in the past,</i>

00:19.519 --> 00:22.545
<i>facing mirror images
that were not his own...</i>

00:22.622 --> 00:26.854
<i>and driven by an unknown force
to change history for the better.</i>

00:26.926 --> 00:32.192
<i>His only guide on this journey is Al,
an observer from his own time,</i>

00:32.265 --> 00:36.634
<i>who appears in the form of a hologram
that only Sam can see and hear.</i>

00:36.703 --> 00:41.072
<i>And so, Dr. Beckett finds himself
leaping from life to life,</i>

00:42.442 --> 00:44.876
<i>striving to put right
what once went wrong...</i>

00:44.944 --> 00:47.344
<i>and hoping each time
that his next leap...</i>

00:47.414 --> 00:49.405
<i>will be the leap home.</i>

00:54.020 --> 00:56.284
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

01:02.062 --> 01:04.053
Can you hear me?

01:06.499 --> 01:08.558
Who are you?

01:11.538 --> 01:14.166
Oh, boy! Oh, boy!

Who are you?

02:40.126 --> 02:42.321
<i>No.!</i>

02:42.395 --> 02:46.195
No, come back!
Come back!

02:46.266 --> 02:48.734
Pop. Hey!
No!

02:48.801 --> 02:50.792
There you are.

02:52.005 --> 02:54.496
Come back.

02:54.574 --> 02:57.441
Come on, Pop. Not
again. Did you see that?

02:57.510 --> 02:59.978
Did you see them?
Yeah.

03:00.046 --> 03:02.241
Pop. You had to have seen
that. It was incredible.

03:02.315 --> 03:07.844
Oh, my God! Th-The lights, then the-the-the
spinning and then it whoosed like that.

03:07.921 --> 03:10.947
They got
- They gotta come back. Yeah. Yeah. Sure.

03:11.024 --> 03:14.289
Come on, Pop. Come on.
If I don't get you back, they'll-

03:14.360 --> 03:17.386
<i>Will you just come on before-
Hold it right there, please.</i>

03:19.465 --> 03:22.491
Oh, major bummer.

03:25.338 --> 03:27.431
<i>Thank God.
Where were they?</i>

03:27.507 --> 03:31.944
I found 'em in the woods out by the
hospital. I guess I'll be on my way. Ma'am.

03:34.180 --> 03:36.307
Thanks.

03:36.382 --> 03:40.819
Well, you got a long way this time,
Dad, especially in your slippers.

03:40.887 --> 03:43.947
<i>- Dad.
- Well, are you both all right?</i>

03:44.023 --> 03:46.685
<i>Of course.
Don't you talk to your mother like that,</i>

03:46.759 --> 03:48.784
<i>especially after
worrying us this way.</i>

03:48.861 --> 03:52.160
<i>What about you, Dad? Don't you
have anything to say for yourself?</i>

03:52.232 --> 03:56.066
Uh, yeah. S-Sorry.

03:56.135 --> 03:59.104
- Dad, get off his case.
- You get your butt up to bed.

03:59.172 --> 04:02.630
<i>I'll deal with you in the morning. Deal with me, what? L
- I just went out to find him.</i>

04:02.709 --> 04:06.805
Without telling us. What, so you could
sneak him up the back stairs again?

04:06.879 --> 04:09.575
How many times you guys
gotten away with it?

04:09.649 --> 04:13.278
Look, I'm-I'm sorry if I've caused any
trouble, but maybe if we all got some sleep-

04:13.353 --> 04:16.322
- Don't you want to tell us about your little walk?
- Little walk?

04:16.389 --> 04:18.755
See anything... interesting?

04:18.825 --> 04:21.190
A- As a matter of fact-

04:25.231 --> 04:27.461
It was a beautiful night.

04:27.533 --> 04:30.001
<i>Beautiful night?
Yeah. It was a trip, Dad.</i>

04:30.069 --> 04:32.094
Bright stars, quarter moon.

04:33.072 --> 04:38.009
- Besides, who could blame him for wanting to get out of here?
- I thought I told you to get up to bed.

04:38.077 --> 04:41.843
<i>John, look, Pop's right. We're all gonna
feel a lot better after a good night's sleep.</i>

04:41.914 --> 04:43.905
Come on.

04:44.917 --> 04:47.511
I won't.

04:51.391 --> 04:53.552
Good goin', Pop.
You totally maintained.

04:53.626 --> 04:55.560
Well, I lied to 'em, yeah.

04:55.628 --> 05:00.156
Well, don't tell 'em anything they don't
want to hear. Ah, you and Richard Nixon.

05:00.233 --> 05:03.066
Old Tricky Dick?
He's history.

05:03.136 --> 05:06.367
Right.

05:06.439 --> 05:09.067
Look,

05:09.142 --> 05:13.476
are you sure
that your dad- my son-

05:13.546 --> 05:15.810
Does he know what
happened out there?

05:15.882 --> 05:17.816
<i>Get a clue, Pop.</i>

05:17.884 --> 05:23.379
<i>You haven't talked about anything but
saucers and spaceships for two months now.</i>

05:25.124 --> 05:30.061
- Or are you losing it for real this time?
- No, I'm-I'm-I'm fine, I think.

05:30.129 --> 05:35.032
- And you're sure you didn't see anything?
- A lot of trees, bushes.

05:35.101 --> 05:38.559
- I tripped on a boulder, almost wasted my knee.
- You know what I mean.

05:38.638 --> 05:41.163
Yeah. I know.

05:41.240 --> 05:45.370
Look, Pop, I wish I did see
your little green men.

05:45.445 --> 05:47.913
I'm not talkin' about
little green men, all right?

05:47.980 --> 05:51.472
I'm talkin' about the lights, about
the ship. You had to have seen the-

05:53.252 --> 05:56.517
All right, all right. What
else have I been telling you?

05:58.291 --> 06:02.489
Look, Pop, you're tired, okay?

06:02.562 --> 06:05.895
Just get some rest.
But will you stay put, please?

06:05.965 --> 06:11.494
'Cause I can't keep fishin' you out of the woods,
or the old man is gonna ground me until I'm your age.

06:11.571 --> 06:14.369
So give it a rest, okay?

06:14.440 --> 06:17.068
Okay.
All right.

06:19.912 --> 06:21.937
Tim?
Hmm?

06:22.014 --> 06:24.107
- You're a good kid.
- You too.

06:24.984 --> 06:27.316
- Good night.
- Night.

06:39.565 --> 06:42.125
<i>I know you're out there.</i>

07:05.024 --> 07:08.016
Hmm.
What on earth was that?

07:23.843 --> 07:25.970
Oh, my God.

07:28.414 --> 07:30.848
<i>"Photo by Maxwell Stoddard. "</i>

07:34.020 --> 07:37.649
<i>Oh, 1966. Great. When in 1966?</i>

07:37.723 --> 07:42.285
You're absolutely right, Sam.
It is 1966. It's May 21, to be exact, yes.

07:42.361 --> 07:44.488
Thank God you're here.
Oh, good to see you.

07:44.564 --> 07:46.555
Um, I saw something.
Oh, you did?

07:46.632 --> 07:48.862
Yeah.
And it was incredible.

07:48.935 --> 07:52.268
I mean, the lights, the motion-
Oh, not you too.

07:52.338 --> 07:56.365
It started right after I leaped in. In fact, at
first, I thought it was a part of the leap-in,

07:56.442 --> 07:58.501
or that maybe I was gonna leap
right back out again.

07:58.578 --> 08:00.637
Only it kept on going
and it became more beautiful.

08:00.713 --> 08:04.171
You'll never guess what it was. It was the
most beautiful thing. You saw a flying saucer.

08:04.250 --> 08:06.912
Well, no. It wasn't exactly a saucer,
see, because it wasn't that flat.

08:06.986 --> 08:09.648
It was more like a bowl. Of course,
I was only seeing it from the-

08:10.656 --> 08:12.590
You know?
Of course, I know.

08:12.658 --> 08:15.991
Your name is Maxwell Stoddard,
you're 79 years old...

08:16.062 --> 08:18.656
and you're convinced that
you've been seeing U.F.O.s.

08:18.731 --> 08:21.529
I did see one. Uh, yeah. But see,
that's what happens to you, Sam.

08:21.601 --> 08:25.594
Ziggy says your memory is Swiss-cheesed
with the real Mr. Stoddard,

08:25.671 --> 08:30.404
who, by the way right now, is in the waiting
room and he thinks he's on his way to Venus.

08:30.476 --> 08:33.570
Guy must be terrified. Au
contraire. He's in heaven.

08:33.645 --> 08:36.672
He keeps fingering our clothes.
He wants to know what we eat.

08:36.749 --> 08:39.946
You know what he says to me?
He says- He says, "Take me to your leader. "

08:40.019 --> 08:43.419
So I turned him over to Gooshie. Told him
he was the king of the planet Halitosis.

08:43.489 --> 08:47.016
Al, I've got to find a way
to get back to those woods.

08:47.093 --> 08:50.756
Because there has to be some
kind of physical evidence there-

08:50.830 --> 08:53.025
<i>That's exactly what
you should not do.</i>

08:53.099 --> 08:55.590
No, no, no, no. See, you don't
realize what I've discovered. No, Sam,

08:55.668 --> 08:58.899
you don't realize that in
less than a week, your son, John,

08:58.971 --> 09:02.702
is gonna have you committed
to the local mental hospital.

09:02.775 --> 09:07.610
<i>Just because I saw a U.F.O.? No. Because Max saw
- Max thinks he saw a U.F.O.</i>

09:07.680 --> 09:11.810
And he's been blabbing about it to everybody,
including the parish priest, the ice cream man-

09:11.884 --> 09:13.818
Al, the man is no more
crazy than I am.

09:13.886 --> 09:16.218
And if I can get back to those woods,
I can prove it to you.

09:16.289 --> 09:20.282
That's all we need is for you to go traipsing
through the underbrush in your long johns.

09:20.359 --> 09:23.419
That'll get you into
the hospital even sooner.

09:23.496 --> 09:26.431
Are you sure? I mean, is Ziggy
sure that that's why I'm here?

09:26.499 --> 09:28.865
Uh, 78.1%.

09:28.935 --> 09:32.302
What are the odds of me being here to
prove the existence of extraterrestrials?

09:32.371 --> 09:36.501
Uh, 73.3%. I win!
Yeah, but it's very close.

09:36.576 --> 09:40.103
This isn't horseshoes, Sam. You know Ziggy.
She'll come up with one figure one minute...

09:40.179 --> 09:43.273
and the next, she'll have a whole new
calculation. Sam, you're not being objective.

09:43.349 --> 09:46.512
I'm a scientist. Scientists are
objective. You're not being objective.

09:46.586 --> 09:50.647
Are you kidding? If all scientists were
objective, we wouldn't have the lightbulb.

09:50.723 --> 09:52.657
We never would have
even landed on the moon.

09:52.725 --> 09:54.852
This is '66. You got three years
before you go to the moon.

09:54.927 --> 09:57.794
And I would not be traveling around in time.
You gotta have the dream first, Al.

09:57.863 --> 10:01.629
Great scientists are never objective. And that's
why people always think that they're loony.

10:01.701 --> 10:05.034
Which is exactly
what they think about Max.

10:05.104 --> 10:08.164
But don't you see-

10:08.240 --> 10:10.504
<i>I mean, don't you get it, Al?</i>

10:10.576 --> 10:13.010
You see, a discovery like this-
I mean, it could mean-

10:13.079 --> 10:18.915
<i>I feel the way I felt the first time I saw
my time-travel calculations working.</i>

10:18.985 --> 10:24.321
I'm so unbelievably lucky to
- to be there on the cutting edge of solving one of mankind's oldest riddles.

10:24.390 --> 10:28.258
And now
- now I have a chance to solve a second one in the same lifetime.

10:28.327 --> 10:30.318
I mean-

10:30.396 --> 10:34.662
Nobody gets that chance.
Nobody.

10:37.737 --> 10:40.570
Oh, God.
John.

10:40.640 --> 10:45.168
He's gotten worse. We just can't
give him the care that he needs.

10:45.244 --> 10:50.546
He'll be miserable in a hospital.
We don't have a choice.

10:50.616 --> 10:52.607
Oh.

11:00.359 --> 11:05.956
<i>I was up at dawn dying to prove that
what I'd seen in the woods last night was real.</i>

11:06.032 --> 11:11.664
<i>And then if I could reconcile Tim and his dad in
the process, that would be the icing on the cake.</i>

11:11.737 --> 11:14.069
<i>Get it while it's hot.</i>

11:16.142 --> 11:18.508
Morning.
Morning, Pop.

11:18.577 --> 11:21.410
You hungry?
I could eat a horse.

11:21.480 --> 11:25.280
Well, I'm afraid you're gonna have to
settle for bacon and eggs this morning. Sit.

11:25.351 --> 11:27.819
<i>So then I'm supposed to go
Just because you want me to?</i>

11:27.887 --> 11:30.185
<i>Because I know
what's right for you.</i>

11:30.256 --> 11:34.249
You don't even know who I am.
I mean, college isn't right for everyone.

11:34.326 --> 11:37.090
Seventeen years old
and he thinks he knows everything.

11:37.163 --> 11:40.257
Oh, okay. The older you
are, the smarter you are?

11:40.332 --> 11:44.632
<i>Fine. We'll ask Pop. He's older than
both of us, all of us, put together.</i>

11:44.704 --> 11:46.968
<i>Oh, no. Don't put your
grandfather in the middle of this.</i>

11:47.039 --> 11:49.371
Why? Don't you respect
your own father's wisdom?

11:49.442 --> 11:51.376
You're my son, not his.

11:51.444 --> 11:55.778
Pop, you were a teenager
when you left Ireland, right?

11:55.848 --> 12:00.410
<i>He was trying to escape a potato famine,
not run away to Greenwich Village.</i>

12:00.486 --> 12:03.785
He wanted a better life,
which is exactly what I want.

12:03.856 --> 12:05.983
<i>I want to be a musician.</i>

12:06.058 --> 12:08.117
Or a long-haired hippie bum.

12:08.194 --> 12:11.288
<i>Dad, I have the talent.
I gotta at least try.</i>

12:11.363 --> 12:14.730
You can either go to City College
or come to work with me.

12:14.800 --> 12:16.927
<i>You know, uh, maybe-</i>

12:17.002 --> 12:20.460
- maybe there's a way you could do both.
- You stay out of this, Pop.

12:20.539 --> 12:23.770
<i>Wh-Why should he? He's been more of
a father to me than you ever have.</i>

12:48.100 --> 12:50.466
<i>Look, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, uh, Son.</i>

12:50.536 --> 12:54.404
Uh, he's young, you know?
Don't make excuses.

12:54.473 --> 12:56.964
I'm not. I'm on your side
on this one. That's a first.

12:57.042 --> 13:00.205
Look, could you just slow down
for a second? I'm sorry, Dad.

13:00.279 --> 13:02.213
How's your hip doing?

13:02.281 --> 13:05.580
It's good. It's good. It's, uh- It's
feelin' good. L- I feel like I'm 40 today.

13:05.651 --> 13:07.915
Good. That's good, Sam. Great,
Dad. I'll see you tonight.

13:07.987 --> 13:10.615
<i>- And you're sounding like your sane.
- I am sane.</i>

13:10.689 --> 13:15.456
Dad, I never said you were insane.

13:15.528 --> 13:18.656
All right. Maybe that's, um-
that's too strong of a word.

13:18.731 --> 13:22.667
But you think that
I'm losing touch, right?

13:22.735 --> 13:28.435
Look, I-I know it can't be easy
living with someone... eccentric like me.

13:28.507 --> 13:32.170
But don't underestimate Max Stoddard.
He's got plenty of good years left in him.

13:32.244 --> 13:34.007
- Oh, he's got 20.
- Sure, you do.

13:34.079 --> 13:35.979
You believe that?
Yeah.

13:36.048 --> 13:38.881
Then why are you giving up on
me? Dad, I'm not giving up on you.

13:38.951 --> 13:41.442
You're talking about
sending me to a sanitarium.

13:41.520 --> 13:47.186
Well, your hearing's still good.
Yeah, it is. And so is my mind.

13:47.259 --> 13:49.693
I don't care what you think,
I'm not crazy.

13:49.762 --> 13:54.358
But a couple months in a psych ward and
I will be. Now, is that what you want?

13:54.433 --> 13:56.264
Dad, be fair.
Fair?

13:56.335 --> 14:01.602
I gave you more than a few second chances
when you were a snot-nosed little kid, right?

14:01.674 --> 14:04.199
More than a few.
Then do the same for me.

14:04.276 --> 14:07.404
I promise I won't let you down.

14:07.479 --> 14:10.915
All right.
Thanks.

14:15.054 --> 14:19.923
Uh, just promise me that you won't
head for the woods as soon as I leave.

14:19.992 --> 14:22.392
Hmm. Promise.

14:27.132 --> 14:29.760
Where are you goin'?

14:29.835 --> 14:33.737
I'm goin' for a walk, okay?
We need to talk.

14:33.806 --> 14:37.469
<i>Max Stoddard's been keeping
detailed U.F.O. Records for 50 years, Al.</i>

14:37.543 --> 14:39.534
<i>I know he must have a theory.</i>

14:39.612 --> 14:43.878
<i>And according to his diary, this town has
a long history of unexplained sightings.</i>

14:43.949 --> 14:49.285
<i>I want you to get Ziggy to back-trace all the data from
the local newspapers and see what she comes up with.</i>

14:49.355 --> 14:51.755
I can't help you with that, Sam, because
- Why not?

14:51.824 --> 14:55.726
Well, the local library burned down.
Ziggy can't access that information.

14:55.794 --> 14:57.728
When'd it burn down?

14:57.796 --> 14:59.730
When?
Yeah.

14:59.798 --> 15:03.029
Oh, September 7, 1968.

15:03.102 --> 15:05.593
So then it's still there.
Yeah. Yeah.

15:05.671 --> 15:08.333
But seriously, Sam-
Seriously what? Why don't you-

15:08.407 --> 15:11.001
<i>You don't wanna go
- Hey, look at that. I had a paper route once.</i>

15:11.076 --> 15:13.977
It's stuffy in the library.
Look out.

15:14.046 --> 15:16.776
Hi, Max!
Hey! Hey! He almost hit you!

15:16.849 --> 15:19.818
But seriously, Sam. Now seriously.
You gotta- Sam!

15:19.885 --> 15:24.948
Come on. For Max's sake, you've got to get off
this U.F.O. Stuff and don't go to the library.

15:25.024 --> 15:27.822
Why? I'm just gonna do a little
reading, okay? A little reading.

15:27.893 --> 15:31.761
Yes. About flying saucers and little
aliens and-and "Beam me up, Scotty. "

15:31.830 --> 15:35.197
What happens ifJohn catches you? He's
at work. So's Eva. Tim's at school, okay?

15:35.267 --> 15:38.327
I promise you, I won't take anything
out of the library, all right? Sam. Sam.

15:38.404 --> 15:40.634
Lookit, in a town like
this, everybody talks. What?

15:40.706 --> 15:45.006
That old coot, Max, is babbling to everybody,
and you're not helping anything.

15:45.077 --> 15:48.638
Don't call him an old coot.
Okay, he's a young coot.

15:48.714 --> 15:51.581
Sam, I don't mean
to frustrate you.

15:51.650 --> 15:53.584
Well, you are.
It's just-

15:53.652 --> 15:57.213
If you think that Max has got Alzheimer's or
somethin' like that, forget it. No, I don't-

15:57.289 --> 16:01.385
This guy has been into U.F.O. S, according to his
scrapbook, since he was a pilot in World War I.

16:01.460 --> 16:03.826
<i>Fascinating.</i>

16:03.896 --> 16:06.524
Absolutely fascinating.

16:06.598 --> 16:08.532
The man talks to himself.

16:08.600 --> 16:12.866
<i>Any testimony he gives us will
be compromised. Not necessarily.</i>

16:12.938 --> 16:15.031
<i>Sigmund Freud
talked to himself constantly.</i>

16:15.107 --> 16:19.271
<i>Ludwig van Beethoven carried on
entire conversations with thin air.</i>

16:19.345 --> 16:23.611
Yeah. But I don't think they thought
they were talking to spacemen.

16:26.285 --> 16:32.019
Correct me if I'm wrong, but wasn't 1966 the year when
there was a worldwide increase in U.F.O. Sightings?

16:32.091 --> 16:34.184
How come you remember
that? Yes or no?

16:34.259 --> 16:37.922
I don't know! Maybe! And weren't there a
significant number of sightings in the northern U.S.?

16:37.997 --> 16:41.728
Sam, will you stop?
Al, do you think that I'm crazy?

16:41.800 --> 16:45.759
Do you think I'm irresponsible? No. Do you
- Do you think I'm prone to hallucinations, huh?

16:45.838 --> 16:49.604
Well, sometimes when you
psycho-synergize, like you did with Oswald.

16:49.675 --> 16:52.610
Well, never mind. Okay.
If anything, you're too sane.

16:52.678 --> 16:58.116
All right. Then listen to me. I have spent my
whole life learning to be a trained observer.

16:58.183 --> 17:00.117
So? So have I.
I'm an observer.

17:00.185 --> 17:04.815
Al, I am telling you that what
I saw in those woods last night...

17:04.890 --> 17:09.292
can only be explained in one way. But
I am telling you it doesn't matter.

17:09.361 --> 17:14.230
You're still here to keep Max Stoddard
from dying in some state-run bedlam.

17:14.299 --> 17:17.233
I know that. I know that.
But, Al, my God,

17:17.301 --> 17:20.760
if I can prove
that U.F.O. S exist,

17:20.839 --> 17:25.367
<i>I mean, it's as equally as important
as Project Quantum Leap itself.</i>

17:25.444 --> 17:29.073
At the same time, I could prove that
Max isn't crazy. I want to do both.

17:29.148 --> 17:32.083
- But. Sam, you can't.
- Why not? If I give them irrefutable evidence-

17:32.151 --> 17:35.052
But they'll refute it
no matter what it is.

17:35.120 --> 17:38.021
People have been trying to prove that
U.F.O. S exist for hundreds of years.

17:38.090 --> 17:40.081
They can't do it!
What makes you so special?

17:40.159 --> 17:43.617
I don't know, Al. But I know
what I saw. But it's too risky.

17:43.695 --> 17:47.927
You go out your bedroom window tonight, you get
as far as the corner market, they pick you up.

17:48.000 --> 17:51.902
What happens to Max? What if they don't
pick me up, huh? What if I don't get caught?

17:55.274 --> 17:59.108
I changed my mind.
You are crazy.

18:00.179 --> 18:03.114
This is pointless.
The old man's coming unglued.

18:03.182 --> 18:05.412
We don't know that for sure.

18:06.518 --> 18:12.150
Come on. When you're riding alone in a car,
don't you ever rehearse conversations...

18:12.224 --> 18:14.920
<i>or things you wish you'd said?
Yeah. Sure I do.</i>

18:14.993 --> 18:17.928
But he's not in a car.
He's on a public dock.

18:17.996 --> 18:20.863
<i>And I usually don't wave my arms
and pace around like a caged animal.</i>

18:20.933 --> 18:23.299
Next thing you know,
he'll be foaming at the mouth.

18:23.368 --> 18:26.826
Look, I don't try to play soldier.
Why don't you quit playing psychiatrist?

18:26.905 --> 18:29.305
I say we classify him "Not Relevant"
and head back to D.C.

18:29.374 --> 18:32.366
- We've got plenty of other subjects.
- Not who've kept notes like Stoddard,

18:32.444 --> 18:34.378
<i>or written articles.</i>

18:34.446 --> 18:38.280
<i>Frankly, I find his theory of return U.F.O.
Visitations in this area quite coherent.</i>

18:38.350 --> 18:40.284
<i>Yeah. Alice In Wonderland
is coherent too.</i>

18:40.352 --> 18:43.378
- That doesn't mean I believe in grinning cats who disappear.
- You give up too easily.

18:43.455 --> 18:47.949
<i>Are you seriously gonna put your signature on a report
about a man whose own son wants to have him committed?</i>

18:48.026 --> 18:51.359
<i>Not unless I can verify
his testimony with other ways.</i>

18:51.430 --> 18:54.331
- You know I don't like those other ways.
- They work, Major.

18:54.399 --> 18:59.803
<i>I think maybe the state hospital Just might be
the safest place for Maxwell Stoddard after all.</i>

19:13.852 --> 19:16.480
<i>Hey, Tim, I was think-</i>

19:19.057 --> 19:23.016
Going somewhere? Uh, yeah,
um, camping with the guys.

19:23.095 --> 19:26.587
Um, we're, you know, hanging out,
maybe catch some fish.

19:26.665 --> 19:29.099
How come you're home early?

19:29.168 --> 19:33.935
I thought you and I were supposed
to have a real, honest relationship.

19:34.006 --> 19:36.372
We do.

19:36.441 --> 19:38.500
You're not going camping.

19:38.577 --> 19:44.015
Okay. Lanny's picking me up tonight,
we're goin' down to the Village.

19:44.082 --> 19:47.279
When are you coming back?
I'm not, Pop.

19:49.955 --> 19:53.618
You're running away? In three months,
I'll be old enough to get drafted.

19:53.692 --> 19:55.683
I'm old enough to
choose my own life.

19:55.761 --> 19:58.457
I agree with that.

19:59.531 --> 20:02.193
You do?
That's great, Pop.

20:02.267 --> 20:05.361
You're also old enough to know that this
is a bad idea. Oh, don't you start on me.

20:05.437 --> 20:08.964
Look, how do you think your dad's gonna feel
when he wakes up tomorrow and you're not here?

20:09.041 --> 20:11.805
Relieved. No way. No way.
And neither is your mom.

20:13.478 --> 20:16.038
Hey, I'll write
as soon as I'm settled.

20:16.114 --> 20:19.743
Look, your dad wants you to stay in school,
right? Right. Right. Community college.

20:19.818 --> 20:23.015
The pits. He just wants to keep me at
home. Maybe that's all he can afford.

20:23.088 --> 20:26.023
They don't even have music classes.

20:26.091 --> 20:31.586
You want to go sleep on sidewalk in
the Village? No way. Lanny's got a van.

20:32.664 --> 20:34.655
What if there was a way
you could do both?

20:35.968 --> 20:40.302
I don't get it. Look, what if you went
to college in New York during the day...

20:40.372 --> 20:42.431
and then you got a job at night
playing the guitar?

20:42.507 --> 20:46.238
You take the money that you earn there
and you put it towards the extra tuition.

20:47.879 --> 20:50.109
No. No. My dad
would never go for it.

20:50.182 --> 20:54.619
Hey, look, you don't know that. Besides, that
depends on how hard we try and sell him on it.

20:54.686 --> 20:58.019
We? Yeah. I'll help you.
I'm sure your mom will too.

20:59.191 --> 21:03.127
I don't know, Pop.
Oh, come on now. Just-

21:03.195 --> 21:06.289
Just think about it, okay?

21:06.365 --> 21:09.425
<i>It's a nice guitar.
Who's your favorite guy?</i>

21:09.501 --> 21:12.163
Lead guy, you know? Chuck
Berry. Keith Richards.

21:12.237 --> 21:15.138
This new guy I haven't told you about
- uh, English guy, Clapton.

21:15.207 --> 21:17.971
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
You ever hear ofJimi Hendrix?

21:18.043 --> 21:20.807
Who's he?
Some old big-band guy?

21:20.879 --> 21:22.813
No, not actually.

21:22.881 --> 21:28.046
If you ever get a chance to hear him play,
you-Wait. You will actually, within the year.

21:28.120 --> 21:30.884
Yeah? Where's he
playing? Woodstock.

21:30.956 --> 21:34.687
Oh, right. There's nothing up there but
farms, Pop. Who's gonna listen, the cows?

21:34.760 --> 21:38.560
Trust me on this, okay?
What's he sound like?

21:43.669 --> 21:47.036
Well, he-he kind of-
Plug that thing in.

21:47.105 --> 21:51.041
Let me see if I can, uh- It's been
a while but, uh- Turn the radio off.

21:56.148 --> 21:58.343
All right. Here we go.

21:59.651 --> 22:02.916
Pop, Pop, be careful.
I just had it fixed.

22:46.998 --> 22:50.058
What the hell is this?

22:50.135 --> 22:52.797
Uh, just a little, uh,
dem-demonstration.

22:52.871 --> 22:56.068
Of what?
A cat in a garbage disposal?

23:00.846 --> 23:04.009
S- Sorry, I- I, uh-

23:04.082 --> 23:06.414
That's okay.
Forget it, Pop.

23:14.226 --> 23:17.252
I can't remember the last time
I had a meal this good.

23:17.329 --> 23:19.297
Thank you, Max.

23:20.365 --> 23:22.356
Tim, you, uh-

23:24.236 --> 23:27.501
you want to talk about what
we discussed this afternoon?

23:29.608 --> 23:32.873
Honey, are you all right?
You've hardly touched your food.

23:32.944 --> 23:34.935
I'm fine.

23:35.013 --> 23:37.641
Your mother worked hard
to put food on the table.

23:37.716 --> 23:41.413
So that makes me an eating machine?
You'll eat it and be glad you have it.

23:41.486 --> 23:44.353
I'm not three anymore, Dad.

23:46.158 --> 23:48.149
It was about college.

23:48.226 --> 23:53.493
<i>Tim wants to play music. You want him to go
to school. I don't see why he can't do both.</i>

23:53.565 --> 23:58.366
- Well, that sounds sensible.
- I thought you said City College didn't have a music department?

23:58.437 --> 24:00.837
L- I-I don't want to study it, Dad.
I want to play it.

24:00.906 --> 24:05.275
<i>We were talking about using his talent
to help pay part of the tuition...</i>

24:05.343 --> 24:07.368
down in Manhattan.

24:10.148 --> 24:13.948
- We've been through this. - Uh, John,
j-just wait a minute. This sounds different.

24:14.019 --> 24:18.479
<i>People do it, Dad. L
- I can play clubs at night and go to school in the day.</i>

24:18.557 --> 24:21.549
And when do you study?
While you sleep?

24:21.626 --> 24:24.322
I don't understand you,
honestly.

24:24.396 --> 24:29.265
<i>If Pop here had offered to feed me and put
me up while I went to college on his nickel,</i>

24:29.334 --> 24:31.393
don't you think I wouldn't
have jumped at the chance?

24:31.470 --> 24:35.497
News flash, Dad: I'm not you! Don't
you ever use that tone with me again.

24:35.574 --> 24:39.032
Fine.
If that's the way you want it.

24:42.447 --> 24:44.881
Tim Stoddard, get back-

24:44.950 --> 24:47.578
Tim-
Where are you going?

24:47.652 --> 24:50.485
I'm goin' to bring him back.
Don't bother.

24:50.555 --> 24:54.184
- John!
- Well, look at 'em. You see how they gang up on me?

24:54.259 --> 24:56.489
It takes a gang
to get through to you.

25:02.300 --> 25:05.929
<i>Tim! He went that way,
Sam. Down by the water.</i>

25:06.004 --> 25:08.529
Al, have Ziggy run a projection
on Timothy's future.

25:08.607 --> 25:10.768
Well, h-he runs away to Manhattan.

25:10.842 --> 25:15.040
And then he plays in a couple of performances
with a small-time band called River Wind.

25:15.113 --> 25:19.743
And- Uh-oh.
He winds up on a slab at Bellevue.

25:19.818 --> 25:22.343
What?
Overdosed on heroin.

25:25.290 --> 25:27.554
Sam?

25:27.626 --> 25:29.617
<i>Sam.!</i>

25:34.032 --> 25:36.193
<i>Tim?</i>

25:36.268 --> 25:39.101
<i>Hey, Tim.!
It's me, Pop.!</i>

25:40.171 --> 25:42.833
I gotta talk to you.

25:42.908 --> 25:44.899
Tim.

25:50.682 --> 25:54.709
Tim? Tim!
Come on. It's just me!

25:56.588 --> 25:58.647
Why is he such a jerk?

26:01.059 --> 26:04.256
Well, that's- that's my son
you're talking about, you know.

26:04.329 --> 26:08.163
I wanted to tell him. I tried
to tell him. I was there.

26:08.233 --> 26:12.932
And he treats us both like babies. And
you're pushing 80. Doesn't that hack you off?

26:13.004 --> 26:15.097
Yeah.

26:17.709 --> 26:19.939
I just got to get out of that house.

26:21.413 --> 26:23.973
Sam, check this out.
Given this new information,

26:24.049 --> 26:26.950
Ziggy's projecting that
your secondary objective is Tim.

26:27.018 --> 26:29.748
That you gotta prevent him
from O.D.'ing.

26:46.938 --> 26:49.099
You get high, don't you?

26:49.174 --> 26:53.702
- Me? What does that have to do with anything?
- This is just between you and me.

26:53.778 --> 26:59.375
Yeah. I've smoked a few joints in my time. L-I use
it for playing music and for listening. It's great.

26:59.451 --> 27:02.978
- No, it's not great.
- What, you've tried it?

27:04.055 --> 27:06.250
No. No.

27:06.324 --> 27:10.784
L
- I'm just telling you that it's not good, okay, for you or for your music.

27:10.862 --> 27:14.764
L- I can't tell you
the number of- of musicians...

27:14.833 --> 27:17.927
whose-whose lives
have been cut short bec-

27:19.871 --> 27:22.806
Actually, I- I can.

27:22.874 --> 27:26.310
- You rememberJimi Hendrix? I was telling you about him?
- Yeah, what about him?

27:26.378 --> 27:29.074
Okay. Remember his name.
And-And Janis Joplin?

27:29.147 --> 27:33.675
I never heard of her.
Well, um, Jim Morrison.

27:33.752 --> 27:36.152
Uh- Uh, Brian Jones.

27:36.221 --> 27:39.850
- He's in the Stones.
- Was. Is. But- But not for long.

27:39.924 --> 27:43.018
- Elvis.
- Right. And Elvis.

27:43.094 --> 27:45.255
Oh, Pop, you're flippin' out
on me again.

27:45.330 --> 27:48.060
No, I'm telling you,
listen to me.

27:48.133 --> 27:52.695
Everyone of those people I just told you about-
Their deaths are all drug related.

27:52.771 --> 27:55.763
I mean it!

27:58.276 --> 28:01.712
Now- Now listen.

28:01.780 --> 28:04.374
I know this doesn't
make a whole lot of sense,

28:05.717 --> 28:09.949
but if you run off to New York City- whatever
you're gonna do- and I'm not around to help you,

28:10.021 --> 28:14.890
I want you to remember this conversation,
okay, and remember those people's names.

28:14.959 --> 28:20.829
And if you start getting' into drugs, okay, not
just grass, but into heavy drugs and stuff like that,

28:20.899 --> 28:24.733
you look at those people,
you look what happened in their lives,

28:24.803 --> 28:27.704
<i>and you remember that we had this talk.
This is brilliant.</i>

28:27.772 --> 28:30.036
- His odds are improving.
- You promise?

28:30.108 --> 28:32.633
I promise. Okay. Tell
me their names again.

28:32.711 --> 28:35.339
Hendrix. JanetJoplin-
Janis.

28:35.413 --> 28:39.907
Whatever. Elvis, Brian Jones.
Too weird.

28:39.984 --> 28:41.918
Uh, Jim Morrison.
Jim Morrison.

28:41.986 --> 28:45.444
- That's it, Sam. He's- He's safe now.
- Thank God.

28:45.523 --> 28:49.584
Pop, you are the original
space cadet.

28:52.964 --> 28:55.933
If you only knew.
Come on. Let's go home.

28:56.000 --> 28:57.991
Let's get out of here.

29:17.088 --> 29:19.886
<i>Mom, Dad.</i>

29:21.192 --> 29:24.753
- I'm sorry.
- Dad, this is Dr. Hardy.

29:24.829 --> 29:27.059
<i>He's a psychiatrist.
Uh-oh.!</i>

29:27.132 --> 29:30.966
- Mr. Stoddard, so glad to meet you.
- Don't- Don't answer them.

29:32.437 --> 29:35.770
I don't understand.
What's he doing here?

29:35.840 --> 29:41.073
- Pop's not crazy.
- Nobody said he was, son. Major Irwin Meadows, U.S. Air Force Intelligence.

29:41.146 --> 29:43.137
Thank you for allowing us
into your home.

29:43.214 --> 29:45.148
<i>I don't know that I did.
You didn't.</i>

29:45.216 --> 29:48.617
Pop, these men are part of
a special government project.

29:48.686 --> 29:52.520
<i>- Come on. Come sit down.
- Yeah. Watergate was a special project too.</i>

29:52.590 --> 29:56.720
What, uh, sort of
a government project?

29:56.795 --> 30:00.322
We investigate unexplained events that
might have a bearing on national security.

30:00.398 --> 30:04.334
- What kind of events?
- Flying saucers, Mr. Stoddard. U.F.O.s.

30:04.402 --> 30:08.839
<i>You're rather well known in these parts for your
interest in the subject. We thought we could talk.</i>

30:08.907 --> 30:10.898
<i>Just don't say anything, Sam.</i>

30:10.975 --> 30:16.572
<i>- Well, you know, some people have
actually, uh, questioned my sanity- - Sam.!</i>

30:16.648 --> 30:21.347
<i>- for claiming these things, so, uh, forgive me if I have
a little, uh, reluctance to- - Totally understandable.</i>

30:21.419 --> 30:26.186
A few crackpots have poisoned the well for
anyone who's seriously interested in the subject.

30:26.257 --> 30:28.987
- And you two are seriously interested?
- Absolutely.

30:29.060 --> 30:33.724
Well, what do you want me to do? I mean, have
you seen something and you want me to confirm it?

30:33.798 --> 30:36.164
<i>I want you to clam up.
Not really.</i>

30:36.234 --> 30:39.965
The government just can't take chances,
what with the Cold War and all.

30:40.038 --> 30:44.600
<i>Our equipment can't see everything,
so we rely on citizens like yourself.</i>

30:44.676 --> 30:48.703
Well, what I saw,
or what I might have seen,

30:48.780 --> 30:51.010
I don't think it had anything
to do with the Russians.

30:51.082 --> 30:54.074
Oh, we believe that. But we have
to consider every possibility.

30:54.152 --> 30:56.279
You believe me?
Yes, sir.

30:56.354 --> 30:59.346
So you're saying that it's-

30:59.424 --> 31:03.383
Well, that seeing something unusual in the
sky doesn't necessarily make a person crazy.

31:03.461 --> 31:06.555
Have you seen a U.F.O.,
Mr. Stoddard?

31:06.631 --> 31:11.068
<i>Not one word. Zero. Zip. Zilch. Nada.</i>

31:11.135 --> 31:13.069
You know, uh,

31:13.137 --> 31:17.870
I really would like to talk to you,
but I've- I've had a very busy day.

31:17.942 --> 31:22.072
<i>I'm surprised. Our sources told us that
you'd be more than willing to cooperate.</i>

31:22.146 --> 31:25.411
Sources? What-What sources?

31:25.483 --> 31:27.576
You've been checking up on me?
We just want your cooperation.

31:27.652 --> 31:29.142
You do?
Yes, sir.

31:29.220 --> 31:33.088
That's what I want. Your cooperation. I'd like to
know a little something about Project Blue Book.

31:36.561 --> 31:38.495
That's classified information,

31:38.563 --> 31:40.155
<i>Mr. Stoddard.</i>

31:40.231 --> 31:45.134
But if your testimony turns out
the way we expect it will,

31:45.203 --> 31:49.606
<i>we might be able to influence our superiors
to share a summary with you.</i>

31:50.675 --> 31:54.202
Oh, that'd be great.
See, I told you you could-

31:54.279 --> 31:56.213
<i>Have faith in me.</i>

31:56.281 --> 31:58.442
Ziggy says don't trust 'em, Sam.
They're big-time nozzles.

31:58.516 --> 32:01.508
<i>Why don't we arrange to meet
tomorrow, somewhere comfortable,</i>

32:01.586 --> 32:03.520
given how much
you have to tell us.

32:03.588 --> 32:06.989
I'm sure the government wouldn't mind giving
you the royal treatment. Well, thank you.

32:07.058 --> 32:11.119
L- I'm sure you'll find that my observations
will be very detailed and accurate.

32:11.195 --> 32:13.129
All right, Pop. Oh,
Pop, we're proud of you.

32:13.197 --> 32:15.165
- See you tomorrow.
- Okay. Thank you.

32:15.233 --> 32:17.098
- I'll show you out.
- Ma'am.

32:26.144 --> 32:28.135
Thanks a lot.

32:32.550 --> 32:34.984
Let's talk.

32:35.053 --> 32:38.386
Thank you very much.
You can't imagine our relief.

32:38.456 --> 32:42.688
These situations are very difficult to evaluate.
What time tomorrow do you want to see him?

32:42.760 --> 32:46.355
I don't think we really need
to speak to him, Mr. Stoddard.

32:46.431 --> 32:50.959
But you said- Dr. Hardy and I have interviewed
hundreds of these so-called witnesses.

32:51.035 --> 32:53.731
We have yet to find a single one
whose facts make any sense at all.

32:53.805 --> 32:57.332
He seems like a sweet old man.
Reminds me of my dad.

32:57.408 --> 32:59.376
Then how the hell can you
lead him along that way?

32:59.444 --> 33:05.144
We thought the appointment idea might give you a chance
to take him to a care facility without him struggling.

33:05.216 --> 33:07.150
You told us you've
had trouble controlling him.

33:07.218 --> 33:10.710
We'll be heading back to D.C.
In the morning.

33:10.788 --> 33:13.985
Listen, be grateful
the hospital's so close.

33:14.058 --> 33:16.652
It makes visitation
so much easier.

33:18.563 --> 33:20.724
Good night.

33:30.408 --> 33:33.343
Did you see their faces when I
said Project Blue Book? Uh, yeah.

33:33.411 --> 33:35.379
Did you see them? I mean,
they were like- Yeah. Um-

33:35.446 --> 33:37.937
<i>Yeah, but I also saw Brando
in One-Eyed Jacks.</i>

33:38.016 --> 33:40.507
Never trust a face when
you can only see one side.

33:40.585 --> 33:42.917
All right. Okay.
What does Ziggy say?

33:42.987 --> 33:45.046
What does Ziggy- Oh.
Yeah.

33:45.123 --> 33:47.523
Uh, "Data inconclusive. "
Huh?

33:47.592 --> 33:53.189
"Data inconclusive"? I got a bad feeling about
this, Sam. Like my second wife. You know? Uh- Uh-

33:53.264 --> 33:55.255
Al-
What's her name?

33:55.333 --> 33:57.426
Yeah, yeah. Al. Al.
The Hungarian one?

33:57.502 --> 34:01.939
What about the data I gave you from the library?
I gave you four very specific activity periods.

34:02.006 --> 34:03.940
Oh, okay.
Oh, yeah. Okay.

34:04.008 --> 34:06.374
Well, in addition to your alleged sighting
- Yeah.

34:06.444 --> 34:11.973
There were two in '62, and then
there was one in June of'58. Just one?

34:12.050 --> 34:14.280
Yes. Well, they could
have missed the second one.

34:14.351 --> 34:18.721
And then there were two
on New Year's, January '55.

34:18.790 --> 34:22.054
Of course, that could have been champagne.
There's a pattern. There's a pattern, Al.

34:22.126 --> 34:25.118
Have Ziggy run a time-coordinated
collation of the sightings, okay? Okay.

34:25.196 --> 34:26.754
Hurry up.
Okay.

34:26.831 --> 34:30.766
<i>Come on. Please be right.
Please be right.</i>

34:31.902 --> 34:33.803
What? You're right,
there's a pattern.

34:33.871 --> 34:38.672
There's a sighting approximately
every 47.51 Earth months.

34:38.743 --> 34:41.303
Yeah? And then there's
a second sighting...

34:41.379 --> 34:44.177
three or four days after
the first one. Yes! Yes!

34:44.248 --> 34:47.978
Don't you see? That's it! They're coming back.
They're coming back. And it could happen any time.

34:48.052 --> 34:52.351
I'm gonna be here to confirm their visit. This is
unbelievable! Don't you understand what I'm saying?

34:52.422 --> 34:56.688
With everything we know now, and with Ziggy
- I mean, if we can make contact, right?

34:56.761 --> 34:59.787
<i>And you gotta presume that they have
some kind of a computer system, right?</i>

34:59.864 --> 35:04.460
<i>If Ziggy can hook up into that, the possibilities-
They're endless, right? We can go- I mean-</i>

35:05.570 --> 35:11.406
<i>You see, Project Blue Book has
Washington's top priority U.F.O. Research.</i>

35:11.476 --> 35:14.445
<i>I can't wait to get a look
at what they must have.</i>

35:14.512 --> 35:18.004
I'll even bet they'll want to
include my information with it.

35:19.884 --> 35:23.752
Boy, I can't wait
to tell those guys.

35:23.821 --> 35:26.153
Huh? I mean, to see
their faces when I'll tell 'em.

35:26.224 --> 35:28.852
They're gonna-
Charlemont State Hospital?

35:28.926 --> 35:31.554
Wh-What's goin' on? I
thought we were goin'- Dad.

35:31.629 --> 35:33.824
Aw, no. No! Dad, look,
don't make it harder.

35:33.898 --> 35:36.093
Don't! You're gonna get hurt.
Pop! You'll just make it worse!

35:36.167 --> 35:38.397
You're makin' a mistake!
You're gonna be all right.

35:38.469 --> 35:40.903
You're making a terrible mistake!
Please, Pop.

35:40.972 --> 35:42.906
<i>Make it easy on yourself.
Please.!</i>

35:42.974 --> 35:47.411
<i>Just let me go, plea-Ah.! Let me go.!</i>

35:47.478 --> 35:49.412
No, listen to me!
Come here!

35:49.480 --> 35:53.416
This is all wrong. Look, I was invited
to meet a team of government officials,

35:53.484 --> 35:55.418
not to come here.

35:55.486 --> 35:58.546
<i>But we are here.</i>

35:59.824 --> 36:01.815
Shall we get started?

36:13.271 --> 36:15.205
I studied your service record,
Mr. Stoddard.

36:15.273 --> 36:17.867
Most combat veterans would be eager
to help when their country called.

36:17.942 --> 36:20.536
How about when their country
kidnaps them and ties 'em up in bed?

36:20.611 --> 36:24.411
<i>Please understand.
This is our job- a government mission.</i>

36:24.482 --> 36:27.747
<i>Uh, Sam? Ohh.</i>

36:27.818 --> 36:31.049
- Oh, Sam, I wouldn't let 'em do that.
- Do I have a choice?

36:31.122 --> 36:34.455
- You made your choice last night.
- What's in the needle?

36:34.525 --> 36:38.222
<i>What's in the needle?
Sodium Pentothal.</i>

36:38.296 --> 36:43.131
A truth serum, widely used.
Short-acting, no lasting effects.

36:43.201 --> 36:46.762
No. No, Sam, don't let 'em give you that.
There's no telling what you'll say.

36:46.837 --> 36:49.738
<i>Uh, you could change history.
You could even doom Quantum Leap.</i>

36:49.807 --> 36:53.743
- Hold him down.
- Look, h-how could you do this? You're a doctor.

36:53.811 --> 36:57.406
You know, he's got a point. I didn't
join the air force to harass old men.

36:57.481 --> 37:00.575
You joined it, so follow
orders. Sam, say something!

37:00.651 --> 37:03.916
Tell 'em anything! Make it up if you have to!
But don't let 'em shoot you with that junk!

37:03.988 --> 37:06.821
<i>All right, all right. Look.</i>

37:06.891 --> 37:10.258
I saw a self-illuminated elliptical orb...

37:10.328 --> 37:15.095
<i>- roughly 15 meters on the long axis, 10 on the short.
- Record this.</i>

37:15.166 --> 37:17.930
<i>This was three nights ago,
correct?</i>

37:18.002 --> 37:20.266
- May 21.
- Right. Right.

37:20.338 --> 37:24.672
It hovered approximately
10 to 20 meters above the ground...

37:24.742 --> 37:28.473
- with no apparent means of propulsion.
- Wow. Photographic memory?

37:28.546 --> 37:31.845
He could be quoting from something he read.
Let's make sure.

37:31.916 --> 37:34.908
- No! No!
- No! Hey! You bastards!

37:34.986 --> 37:37.887
Gooshie, what am I gonna do now?

37:40.391 --> 37:42.689
Oh, boy.

37:45.529 --> 37:48.965
Could you believe
all those forms?

37:49.033 --> 37:52.002
Look, we had to do it.
I know, I know.

37:52.069 --> 37:55.732
Tim, don't blame me.
Some day you're gonna understand.

37:55.806 --> 37:59.708
It's okay, Dad. I caught him
talking to himself last night.

37:59.777 --> 38:02.507
Not just mumbling,
a whole conversation.

38:02.580 --> 38:07.313
Yeah. I've seen him do that too. It's
almost like he's got some imaginary friend.

38:07.385 --> 38:12.755
Maybe it runs in the family.
You had one when you were little.

38:12.823 --> 38:15.815
Oh, I just hope I never
have to put you in here.

38:19.730 --> 38:22.665
Hold on.
That's their car.

38:22.733 --> 38:26.032
<i>Whose? Your government guys. I thought you
said they were going back to Washington.</i>

38:26.103 --> 38:29.595
That's what they told me. It's a
blue sedan. It could be anybody's.

38:29.674 --> 38:33.542
With government plates?
Let's go see.

38:33.611 --> 38:36.910
<i>We are going to ask you
a series of questions.</i>

38:36.981 --> 38:40.075
<i>You will answer
all of them truthfully.</i>

38:40.151 --> 38:42.381
Do you understand?

38:44.021 --> 38:45.955
Truthfully.

38:46.023 --> 38:49.254
Let's start with something simple,
like your name.

38:49.327 --> 38:52.490
- No, Sam.
- Sam.

38:52.563 --> 38:57.159
<i>- Louder, please.
- Dr. Samuel Beckett.</i>

38:58.235 --> 39:01.329
- No.
- Think you gave him too much?

39:01.405 --> 39:06.001
- Do you know where you are?
- I'm in, uh, New Mexico.

39:06.077 --> 39:08.443
What is the date?

39:08.512 --> 39:12.539
May 1, 1999.

39:12.616 --> 39:18.384
<i>Gooshie, if I should suddenly, pop out of existence,
I wanna leave everything to my first wife, Beth.</i>

39:18.456 --> 39:20.424
Tell us about yourself,
Dr. Beckett.

39:20.491 --> 39:25.895
Born: 8%8%53.
Terrific.

39:25.963 --> 39:29.091
He's 13 years old?
Or 113.

39:29.166 --> 39:32.567
<i>Father's name:
John Samuel Beckett.</i>

39:32.636 --> 39:35.935
Mother's name:
Thelma Louise Beckett.

39:36.006 --> 39:39.066
<i>Social security number:</i>

39:41.045 --> 39:44.139

39:44.215 --> 39:46.308

40:04.902 --> 40:09.362
<i>- Did you hear that?
- It's a coincidence. He was in the service.</i>

40:09.440 --> 40:12.932
In World War I.
Umbra is an operative code.

40:14.178 --> 40:18.239
- Why do you need a clearance?
- Hang in there, Sam. Hang in there.

40:18.315 --> 40:21.512
- Why do you need a clearance, Dr. Beckett?
- My project.

40:21.585 --> 40:23.576
No!

40:23.654 --> 40:25.588
<i>What is your project?</i>

40:25.656 --> 40:29.786
Project... Quantum Leap.

40:29.860 --> 40:33.125
- No! No! No!
- This project studies unidentified flying objects?

40:44.341 --> 40:48.368
<i>What is it?

40:48.446 --> 40:52.849
<i>This patient is under private care.

40:53.918 --> 40:56.978
<i>- Just back off.
- Come on, Pop. Wake up.</i>

40:57.054 --> 40:59.488
- You're making a bad mistake, sir.
- I don't think so.

40:59.557 --> 41:01.491
Tim?
Yeah. Let's go.

41:01.559 --> 41:06.792
- You don't know what you're doing.
- We're taking my father away from you. What else do we need to know?

41:06.864 --> 41:10.391
- Let's get out of here. Can you walk?
- I'll do my best.

41:12.303 --> 41:17.468
<i>Anybody sticks his face out this door, I
swear to God I'll blow it right offhis head.</i>

41:21.111 --> 41:24.478
<i>God, you're heavy.</i>

41:24.548 --> 41:27.574
- Hey, you!
- This way!

41:33.958 --> 41:37.018
Sam. Sam. That
way. Pop, come on!

41:37.094 --> 41:39.654
No. No.
This way.

41:42.233 --> 41:45.066
Let's just rest here.
Pop, where are we goin'?

41:45.135 --> 41:46.830
Over the guardrail.

41:46.904 --> 41:49.702
Pop! Wait!
Dad, watch it. Be careful!

41:53.277 --> 41:56.804
<i>Come on, Sam.
God. Are we lost?</i>

41:56.881 --> 41:59.816
All right. Don't dawdle. You can't
dawdle. They're closing in on you.

41:59.884 --> 42:03.342
There's a creek down there.
We can follow it out of here.

42:03.420 --> 42:06.014
No. No, it-it-it's this way.

42:06.090 --> 42:08.581
Pop, ifTim says the creek
is there, it's there.

42:08.659 --> 42:10.684
Yeah. But we're not
supposed to go there. Dad!

42:10.761 --> 42:13.753
It's this way.
Where you been?

42:13.831 --> 42:16.698
- This is it.
- Are you sure?

42:16.767 --> 42:19.895
Yeah. I'm positive.
This is where they'll come.

42:19.970 --> 42:23.906
<i>- Far out, Pop. This is the spot from the other night.
- This is exactly what this is.</i>

42:23.974 --> 42:26.238
<i>Hey, hide!</i>

42:26.310 --> 42:30.110
<i>You gotta hide.! Hurry up.! Hide.! Hide.!
Hide.! All right! Come on! Come on! This way!</i>

42:30.180 --> 42:33.513
Mr. Stoddard.
Mr. Stoddard, we need to talk.

42:33.584 --> 42:35.643
Well, Dr. Jekyll
and Major Hyde, huh?

42:35.719 --> 42:39.246
Listen, try and find 'em,
you slime buckets.

42:39.323 --> 42:43.259
<i>You don't seriously plan on keeping
your father out here all night, do you?</i>

42:43.327 --> 42:47.525
You're interfering with an official U.S.
Government investigation. That can be a felony.

42:47.598 --> 42:50.999
What do I do? I don't know. We're
way outside the original history now.

42:51.068 --> 42:54.333
<i>You don't want to see your son and grandson
do time in a federal prison.</i>

42:58.709 --> 43:00.700
What are you doin'?

43:04.481 --> 43:06.472
Over here.

43:11.355 --> 43:14.791
You made the smart choice.

43:14.858 --> 43:17.088
Come on, sir.

43:18.329 --> 43:22.197
Let him go!

43:24.034 --> 43:27.868
Put the shotgun down, Son.
Don't be stupid.

43:29.740 --> 43:33.335
<i>The shot pattern on that gun
will certainly kill your father too.</i>

43:33.410 --> 43:36.004
Yeah, like you care!

43:37.047 --> 43:39.277
Let him go!

43:49.960 --> 43:53.396
<i>Well, I'll be, Dad.
You were right all along.</i>

43:53.464 --> 43:56.592
<i>A self-illuminated elliptical orb...</i>

43:56.667 --> 43:59.227
<i>approximately 15 meters
on the long axis,</i>

43:59.303 --> 44:01.237
<i>10 on the short.</i>

44:01.305 --> 44:03.739
<i>Hop aboard, Sam.
What?</i>

44:03.807 --> 44:09.143
<i>There's a 98.6% chance the old coot
is gonna take a ride ofhis lifetime.!</i>

44:21.625 --> 44:24.059
Hello!

44:27.431 --> 44:29.422
Bye, Pop.

44:48.686 --> 44:51.883
Hey! Hey! Hey!
What the hell you doin'?

44:54.858 --> 44:56.849
Kill the engine!
Shut it down!

44:56.927 --> 45:00.294
What, are you crazy?
You all right, Jimmy?

45:00.364 --> 45:03.231
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm sorry.
Everybody all right?

45:03.300 --> 45:05.495
<i>Yeah. We're all right.
Get him off there.</i>

45:05.569 --> 45:08.732
Didn't I tell you to stay away from the forklift?
You're not ready to drive it yet.

45:08.806 --> 45:13.766
Frank, is that you? Of course
it's me. Did you hit your head?

45:13.844 --> 45:18.872
No. No, I- No.
No, I didn't-

45:18.949 --> 45:21.110
Jimmy.

45:21.185 --> 45:25.315
Jimmy. I'm Jimmy.

45:25.389 --> 45:28.483
I know you'reJimmy.
And I'm back. I'm back, Frank.

45:28.559 --> 45:30.390
Ha! Look, I'm Jimmy!

45:31.495 --> 45:33.486
Oh, boy.
