WEBVTT

01:17.494 --> 01:18.787
There it is.

01:21.831 --> 01:22.916
By the way,

01:22.999 --> 01:26.086
don't you think there's something
going on between Na-bi and Jae-eon?

01:26.169 --> 01:29.672
Hey. Honestly, how could Na-bi date
a guy like Jae-eon?

01:29.756 --> 01:31.591
Why? Na-bi's pretty.

01:32.091 --> 01:34.344
That's not what I mean.
Jae-eon is the problem.

01:34.928 --> 01:36.513
He's not sincere toward anyone.

01:37.305 --> 01:39.516
That's why I ended things
after a few dates.

01:40.391 --> 01:43.520
Really? You're the one who rejected him?

01:44.312 --> 01:48.191
Yes. I got away from him,
but Na-bi didn't.

01:48.274 --> 01:49.692
There are rumors about her.

01:49.776 --> 01:51.861
What a way to end her school life.

01:51.945 --> 01:53.363
I know, right?

01:53.446 --> 01:55.824
-Did you get everything?
-Yes. Let's go.

02:07.669 --> 02:10.839
<i>Are you working?
I'm arriving at school soon.</i>

02:14.676 --> 02:17.262
Is there someone else you're seeing?

02:18.763 --> 02:19.889
No.

02:21.391 --> 02:22.225
Really?

02:37.991 --> 02:39.325
Excuse me.

02:40.118 --> 02:42.328
Are you Park Jae-eon, by any chance?

02:43.288 --> 02:44.205
Yes.

02:46.457 --> 02:47.959
So it's you.

02:49.961 --> 02:51.671
You bastard!

02:53.715 --> 02:55.174
Sir! What are you doing?

02:55.258 --> 02:57.218
-Move!
-Why are you doing this?

02:59.137 --> 03:02.849
To be honest,
I don't get why you're so upset.

03:02.932 --> 03:04.684
You didn't need to ghost me like that.

03:10.565 --> 03:12.734
I…

03:12.817 --> 03:14.402
Get out of the way!

03:15.069 --> 03:15.987
What was that?

03:18.823 --> 03:19.866
Na-bi!

03:23.161 --> 03:24.537
Get up, you jerk!

03:27.540 --> 03:28.625
Stop, Jae-eon!

03:32.378 --> 03:35.256
-You asshole. Move!
-Sir, wait!

03:35.340 --> 03:37.050
-Move!
-Sir!

03:37.133 --> 03:39.010
-Why did you do it?
-What are you doing?

03:39.093 --> 03:40.637
Why did you do it?

03:40.720 --> 03:42.889
Why? Why did you do it?

03:42.972 --> 03:45.266
-Why did you do it?
-Police?

03:45.350 --> 03:48.353
I'm at Hongseo University and a man is…

03:48.436 --> 03:50.063
-Sol, stop him.
-Why did you do it?

03:50.146 --> 03:51.731
-Come quickly!
-Are you okay?

03:52.440 --> 03:53.691
Why?

03:54.901 --> 03:57.111
Stop it, Jae-eon.

03:59.906 --> 04:04.577
EPISODE 5: I KNOW NOTHING WILL CHANGE.
NEVERTHELESS,

04:08.331 --> 04:09.791
We'll be off now.

04:09.874 --> 04:12.168
What? I'm curious…

04:13.169 --> 04:16.673
I mean, I'm worried about them.

04:16.756 --> 04:19.217
Call me if anything happens.

04:19.842 --> 04:21.719
Okay. You should go.

04:21.803 --> 04:23.054
Bye.

04:23.638 --> 04:26.182
-Be careful. Bye.
-Make sure to call if anything happens.

04:30.478 --> 04:33.022
HONGSEO POLICE STATION

04:58.214 --> 05:02.051
How dare you touch someone
who's already taken?

05:02.969 --> 05:04.929
If you ever come near my sister again,

05:05.013 --> 05:07.890
I'm going to kill you. You scumbag.

05:10.059 --> 05:11.352
Miss.

05:11.436 --> 05:13.563
Let me give you some advice.

05:13.646 --> 05:16.899
You should meet a decent guy.

05:16.983 --> 05:21.154
You'll ruin your life
if you date an asshole like him.

05:35.877 --> 05:37.295
You had something to say.

05:38.046 --> 05:40.465
-What is it?
-Let's talk later.

05:40.548 --> 05:41.966
I'm going home.

05:42.050 --> 05:44.552
Didn't you get hurt?
Let's go to the hospital.

05:44.635 --> 05:46.554
I'm fine. Just worry about yourself.

05:53.519 --> 05:57.065
I wonder what they're talking about now.
I bet they're totally fighting.

05:57.690 --> 06:00.860
I think I just made things worse
by reporting it.

06:00.943 --> 06:03.321
No, you did the right thing.
And it's fine now.

06:03.404 --> 06:06.032
Na-bi could have gotten hurt.

06:06.532 --> 06:07.700
Right?

06:08.993 --> 06:12.747
But Na-bi was trying to stop that man
from hitting Jae-eon.

06:12.830 --> 06:14.540
It was so cool.

06:14.624 --> 06:16.417
-She would have been so scared.
-Right.

06:16.501 --> 06:19.796
Na-bi should have been angry at him,

06:19.879 --> 06:22.256
but she took his side.

06:22.340 --> 06:25.426
I guess it's because she likes him a lot.

06:33.518 --> 06:34.435
I should go.

06:35.812 --> 06:36.938
See you tomorrow.

06:38.940 --> 06:40.274
I'll take you home.

06:41.484 --> 06:44.654
You're acting a bit strange today.
Do you have something to say?

06:45.863 --> 06:48.866
We didn't get to finish
what we were talking about.

06:50.368 --> 06:52.245
It's fine.

06:52.328 --> 06:54.288
This is how we always make up.

06:54.372 --> 06:56.040
As if nothing happened.

06:57.375 --> 07:00.253
I feel like
we shouldn't do that this time.

07:01.337 --> 07:03.464
I'm sorry I didn't tell you about leaving

07:05.341 --> 07:06.592
as an exchange student.

07:06.676 --> 07:10.888
I was more upset by how you said
that was the extent of our relationship.

07:10.972 --> 07:12.306
Hey! You're the one who--

07:16.394 --> 07:18.354
All right. I'm sorry about that too.

07:19.272 --> 07:23.067
I'm sorry about
how I acted at the flea market too.

07:23.151 --> 07:25.319
But why aren't you sorry for
not telling me about him?

07:25.403 --> 07:27.280
Hey, that's unfair.

07:27.363 --> 07:29.323
Ju-hyeok and I aren't dating.

07:29.407 --> 07:31.284
Then what's your relationship with him?

07:57.643 --> 07:59.061
Put this on your lip.

08:05.318 --> 08:06.486
Thanks.

08:07.612 --> 08:09.447
I didn't want you to see me like this.

08:10.156 --> 08:12.283
You nursed me when I was sick.

08:12.366 --> 08:15.203
So let's call it even now. I'm going home.

08:16.579 --> 08:18.247
You're not going to see me anymore?

08:22.793 --> 08:24.587
I want to stay friends with you.

08:25.087 --> 08:25.922
"Friends"?

08:26.589 --> 08:29.342
What do friends even mean to you?

08:29.926 --> 08:32.470
-What do you mean?
-Why did you lie to me?

08:32.553 --> 08:34.472
You said you weren't seeing anyone else.

08:35.056 --> 08:37.225
-Is that so important?
-Hey.

08:38.226 --> 08:40.394
What do you want from me?

08:41.395 --> 08:42.438
Right.

08:44.065 --> 08:46.817
You just want someone who's stupid
so you can--

08:46.901 --> 08:48.903
-What's with you?
-What?

08:48.986 --> 08:51.739
You always draw the line like this.

08:52.823 --> 08:55.368
You just want to see me when you want,

08:55.451 --> 08:57.161
but you're scared I'll get clingy?

08:57.245 --> 08:58.829
Don't worry.

08:59.413 --> 09:01.082
That's not going to happen.

09:02.416 --> 09:03.834
It's not like that!

09:10.967 --> 09:12.885
Then what are we?

09:16.347 --> 09:18.307
Weren't you okay
with everything until now?

09:19.058 --> 09:20.518
-Why are you suddenly--
-Right.

09:21.310 --> 09:23.646
Sorry for acting so cool about it
until now.

09:24.897 --> 09:28.025
Honestly, I haven't heard anything good
since I started seeing you.

09:28.109 --> 09:30.945
I pretended not to notice even
when I knew you weren't sincere,

09:31.028 --> 09:32.196
because…

09:34.532 --> 09:35.700
Because…

09:36.951 --> 09:38.202
<i>I like you.</i>

09:47.044 --> 09:50.047
But I can't stand this anymore.
Let's end this.

09:51.382 --> 09:52.383
What?

09:52.466 --> 09:53.426
It's funny, right?

09:54.010 --> 09:56.262
There's nothing to end anyway.

09:59.223 --> 10:00.349
Yu Na-bi.

10:00.433 --> 10:04.061
Thanks for giving me a reason
to decide to end things.

10:08.316 --> 10:10.776
All right. Let's end this.

10:11.986 --> 10:14.155
You're the one who gets to decide.

10:20.077 --> 10:22.330
Gosh. You're really…

10:26.667 --> 10:28.461
You're really a jerk until the end.

11:36.278 --> 11:38.697
Jae-eon and Na-bi were having an affair,

11:38.781 --> 11:41.450
and that woman caught them!

11:41.951 --> 11:45.371
-No way! They got caught in the act?
-Yes.

11:45.454 --> 11:49.458
So Jae-eon actually got hit by that woman?
That's what happened to his face?

11:49.542 --> 11:51.544
-Yes.
-I heard it was a guy, though.

11:53.546 --> 11:55.589
-Is Jae-eon…
-No way.

11:55.673 --> 11:57.091
Are you sure about that?

11:57.174 --> 12:00.761
I heard it was Na-bi who hit Jae-eon.

12:00.845 --> 12:02.596
Someone saw them fighting at night.

12:02.680 --> 12:04.473
Why would Na-bi hit him?

12:04.557 --> 12:07.351
-Because she found out he was cheating!
-That's ridiculous.

12:07.435 --> 12:11.439
Se-yeong. If Na-bi really hit Jae-eon
that hard, she should join the UFC.

12:12.356 --> 12:14.817
Na-bi should have been happy
after leaving me.

12:14.900 --> 12:17.695
-Jeez.
-You're so ridiculous.

12:19.238 --> 12:20.239
What's that reaction?

12:20.322 --> 12:21.657
It's just a hair dye.

12:21.740 --> 12:23.742
-You're unbelievable.
-It's so pretty.

12:23.826 --> 12:25.077
What should we do with you?

12:25.161 --> 12:28.330
She's a total attention-seeker.

12:28.414 --> 12:29.248
Why? Looks good.

12:29.331 --> 12:32.460
Is it that bad? Everyone at the hair shop
said I looked good.

12:32.543 --> 12:34.628
It's pretty, but it's a shocking look.

12:34.712 --> 12:37.089
The color's really pretty.
Did you bleach it first?

12:37.173 --> 12:39.091
Yes. I almost lost all my hair.

12:42.303 --> 12:43.762
By the way, Bit-na.

12:43.846 --> 12:47.516
Did you hear anything
about Na-bi and Jae-eon?

12:47.600 --> 12:49.101
Hey, be quiet. Na-bi's coming.

12:52.021 --> 12:53.731
-Sol's coming too.
-Hey!

12:53.814 --> 12:55.941
You both aren't coming to the workshop?

12:56.484 --> 12:58.819
Bit-na, you changed your hair.
It looks nice.

12:58.903 --> 13:00.863
Thanks, but don't change the subject.

13:00.946 --> 13:02.948
How can both of you not come?

13:03.032 --> 13:05.242
I feel so betrayed right now!

13:05.826 --> 13:07.369
You should come.

13:07.453 --> 13:09.205
The professors aren't coming.

13:09.288 --> 13:11.874
We can just hang out by ourselves.

13:11.957 --> 13:15.294
-I'm not sure.
-You should both come.

13:15.377 --> 13:17.505
Can't you ask Jae-eon to come, too?

13:17.588 --> 13:19.548
Everyone will come if he comes.

13:19.632 --> 13:21.759
Ask him yourself.
Don't ask her to do that.

13:22.343 --> 13:23.969
But they're close…

13:24.053 --> 13:27.181
But what happened to Jae-eon's face?

13:28.599 --> 13:29.683
What do you mean?

13:30.351 --> 13:33.479
You know, right?
Who did he have a fight with?

13:35.523 --> 13:39.693
Can you please stop asking me
about Jae-eon now?

13:40.986 --> 13:42.988
I don't know much about him, either.

13:43.572 --> 13:46.867
-Hey.
-Jeez, what are you doing?

13:46.951 --> 13:48.536
Come on. Start working.

14:01.382 --> 14:02.466
Hi.

14:07.346 --> 14:08.347
I'm so sorry.

14:10.266 --> 14:12.977
He must have seen something
and misunderstood.

14:13.769 --> 14:15.354
He suddenly went all crazy.

14:17.773 --> 14:19.608
You must be really upset.

14:20.526 --> 14:22.945
Tell your girlfriend I'm sorry too.

14:23.612 --> 14:26.323
-My girlfriend?
-I heard you were with someone.

14:26.907 --> 14:28.534
Wasn't she your girlfriend?

14:29.618 --> 14:31.412
If anything happens, call me.

14:32.246 --> 14:35.291
Even if it's nothing special.

14:35.374 --> 14:38.043
That won't happen.
It'll be the best for both of us.

14:39.044 --> 14:40.045
Right.

14:57.229 --> 14:58.397
Gyu-hyun?

15:04.486 --> 15:05.738
Thank you.

15:13.370 --> 15:14.872
How is it?

15:14.955 --> 15:17.958
He's actually eating mint chocolate?

15:19.668 --> 15:20.544
PINT SIZE
CHOOSE 3 FLAVORS

15:20.628 --> 15:22.212
Chocolate and cashew nuts.

15:24.048 --> 15:25.549
-Hi!
-Hi.

15:25.633 --> 15:28.093
Hey, we're ordering ice cream.
Choose a flavor.

15:28.177 --> 15:31.138
-I want…
-Sorry, you can't choose anymore.

15:31.221 --> 15:33.724
I'm going to order mint chocolate
for the third one.

15:35.225 --> 15:38.646
What? You both don't like mint chocolate?

15:38.729 --> 15:40.898
-I hate it.
-Why would you eat toothpaste?

15:40.981 --> 15:42.024
I know, right?

15:44.944 --> 15:45.903
It's good.

16:34.868 --> 16:36.870
This isn't that simple, you know.

16:36.954 --> 16:38.872
Art isn't easy.

16:38.956 --> 16:41.792
Making something doesn't mean
it will become an art piece.

16:41.875 --> 16:43.377
Haven't I told you several times?

16:43.460 --> 16:45.796
<i>I've never seen his face like that.</i>

16:45.879 --> 16:47.297
<i>Did he feel hurt by my words?</i>

16:47.381 --> 16:51.385
-And most of all, your inspiration…
-<i>No, there's no way.</i>

16:51.468 --> 16:54.763
Na-bi. Are you listening to me?

16:54.847 --> 16:55.806
What?

16:59.101 --> 17:00.519
This is bad.

17:00.602 --> 17:04.231
Will you even
be able to finish this on time?

17:05.065 --> 17:06.275
Sorry, Professor.

17:17.119 --> 17:18.829
That traitor.

17:27.838 --> 17:31.800
I was wondering why you were
in the studio for a change.

17:31.884 --> 17:33.469
Did you get rejected, too?

17:33.552 --> 17:35.179
Of course not, Professor.

17:35.262 --> 17:37.848
I'm the one who rejects guys.
I'd never get rejected.

17:38.807 --> 17:40.851
And I work at the studio often too.

17:40.934 --> 17:42.770
-Is that so?
-Yes.

17:42.853 --> 17:45.022
Then when can I see your work?

17:45.105 --> 17:47.983
I promise to show mine to you
next time, Professor.

17:59.119 --> 18:00.329
Sol.

18:01.705 --> 18:02.873
Yun Sol.

18:03.582 --> 18:05.876
You're losing focus these days too.

18:05.959 --> 18:09.630
Did you decide to give up everything
since you're not leaving?

18:12.883 --> 18:14.802
No. I'm sorry, Professor.

18:19.515 --> 18:22.392
Sol didn't tell me again.

18:27.689 --> 18:29.942
Everything's a mess.

18:30.484 --> 18:32.319
What has gotten into you all?

18:32.903 --> 18:35.572
You should be putting everything
into your work right now.

18:36.824 --> 18:39.118
I told you to get inspiration,

18:39.201 --> 18:41.036
not be reckless!

18:44.414 --> 18:46.959
"She's at it again."
That's what you're thinking, right?

18:47.042 --> 18:49.586
I'm just barking like a dog, aren't I?

18:50.087 --> 18:53.090
My goodness. Maybe I was
a dog in my previous life.

18:53.173 --> 18:54.258
No, Professor.

18:54.341 --> 18:55.926
-No, Professor.
-Sorry, Professor.

19:03.267 --> 19:06.353
-Yun Sol. Here.
-What? Thanks.

19:06.436 --> 19:09.231
Don't take it too personally.
I loved your piece.

19:09.857 --> 19:11.150
Right. Thanks.

19:11.233 --> 19:15.779
By the way, did you really decide
not to leave as an exchange student?

19:23.996 --> 19:25.164
Yes.

19:27.416 --> 19:29.751
Why? Did something happen?

19:31.420 --> 19:32.379
Just because.

19:33.380 --> 19:35.048
I didn't want to leave.

19:38.343 --> 19:40.179
SPICY STIR-FRIED PORK TRIPE

19:55.861 --> 19:58.155
You said your tongue gets numb.

20:22.304 --> 20:25.098
But I can't stand this anymore.
Let's end this.

20:28.310 --> 20:30.771
All right. Let's end this.

20:31.980 --> 20:33.857
You're the one who gets to decide.

21:54.062 --> 21:55.689
Move!

21:58.150 --> 21:59.026
Na-bi!

22:49.493 --> 22:53.413
PARK JAE-EON

22:57.501 --> 23:00.128
<i>The number you have dialed is not
in the directory.</i>

23:00.212 --> 23:02.756
<i>Please check the number and call again.</i>

24:44.357 --> 24:47.319
ALARM

25:48.213 --> 25:49.631
<i>I miss him.</i>

26:00.308 --> 26:03.228
Na-bi's lost it after ending things
with Jae-eon.

26:03.812 --> 26:05.939
She totally got busted by the professor.

26:06.022 --> 26:07.857
She does seem strange these days.

26:07.941 --> 26:10.735
She's working late,
but there's no progress.

26:10.819 --> 26:13.697
I know, right? Why did she have
to get in a relationship?

26:13.780 --> 26:17.575
Things would have been better
if it was an actual relationship.

26:17.659 --> 26:19.077
That's the same thing.

26:19.160 --> 26:21.162
Why would you do that to yourself?

26:21.246 --> 26:24.165
One is bound to end up like that
when it's over.

26:26.543 --> 26:27.919
You should be careful too.

26:29.504 --> 26:30.338
Gosh.

26:31.214 --> 26:32.757
We're totally fine.

26:39.472 --> 26:42.309
There's another victim of love over there.

26:46.688 --> 26:48.023
Nam Gyu-hyun?

26:49.357 --> 26:50.775
Did something happen?

26:50.859 --> 26:53.653
I set him up on a blind date, remember?

26:53.737 --> 26:56.740
I thought it was going well,
but my friend rejected him!

26:58.742 --> 27:01.911
Look at him. I feel so sorry.

27:01.995 --> 27:05.457
So you're saying he's like that
because he got rejected by her?

27:05.540 --> 27:06.833
Yes.

27:06.916 --> 27:07.917
Hey!

27:08.543 --> 27:12.172
Is your friend that attractive?
To be honest, she didn't look that pretty…

27:12.255 --> 27:14.632
What? Have you seen her?

27:17.135 --> 27:21.181
No. I'm just saying…

27:21.848 --> 27:23.933
Gyu-hyun's pretty good-looking, you know.

27:24.017 --> 27:25.810
That's right.

27:25.894 --> 27:28.355
But I shouldn't set up
any more blind dates.

27:33.526 --> 27:35.278
Darn it.

27:51.336 --> 27:53.004
Why don't you leave your hair down?

27:55.548 --> 27:57.133
Just for me.

28:42.595 --> 28:46.891
I was thinking of returning
the necklace to you.

28:47.517 --> 28:48.977
Just throw it away, then.

28:50.812 --> 28:52.689
You say that so easily.

28:58.486 --> 28:59.946
SEOL-A

29:11.875 --> 29:13.042
Hey, Seol-a.

29:14.836 --> 29:16.004
What?

29:18.923 --> 29:20.258
I'll be there right away.

29:35.607 --> 29:37.901
The fee should be about 50,000 won each,

29:37.984 --> 29:39.986
so let's go with the place we changed to.

29:42.280 --> 29:43.615
Are you writing this down?

29:45.074 --> 29:47.160
Yes. He's done.

29:48.203 --> 29:49.537
Okay, that's it for today.

29:51.206 --> 29:52.332
What should we get?

29:52.415 --> 29:54.125
-Vodka?
-Yes!

29:54.209 --> 29:55.919
Should we go for drinks?

29:56.002 --> 29:57.712
-Let's go!
-Yes!

29:57.796 --> 29:59.255
Should we call the others?

29:59.339 --> 30:02.175
Who? Remember last time
when you called so many people?

30:02.258 --> 30:04.135
Gyu-hyun, aren't you coming?

30:04.219 --> 30:05.386
No.

30:05.470 --> 30:07.889
Oh, no. He must have really liked her.

30:07.972 --> 30:10.183
Maybe I should talk to my friend.

30:12.894 --> 30:16.147
VISITORS RESTRICTED
IN EMERGENCY ROOM

30:17.232 --> 30:19.234
How do you feel? Are you okay?

30:21.194 --> 30:23.071
Yes. Thanks.

30:24.155 --> 30:25.573
How much was it?

30:25.657 --> 30:26.699
It's fine.

30:27.242 --> 30:29.118
You have severe anemia.

30:29.911 --> 30:31.579
Make sure to take your meds.

30:33.540 --> 30:35.959
-It's so bothersome.
-You could faint on the streets.

30:38.002 --> 30:41.381
You put your hair down. It suits you.

30:42.131 --> 30:43.216
Really?

30:44.300 --> 30:45.677
I should keep it down, then.

30:48.638 --> 30:49.681
Is something going on?

30:53.059 --> 30:56.229
You changed your number
and your hairstyle.

30:56.312 --> 30:58.231
What's going on?

31:02.569 --> 31:03.570
Just because.

31:04.571 --> 31:05.989
I got sick of things.

31:06.990 --> 31:07.907
What do you mean?

31:09.367 --> 31:10.827
I'm sick of myself.

31:16.624 --> 31:20.336
It will be a narrow but firm base.

31:22.171 --> 31:23.172
Right.

31:26.467 --> 31:27.552
Hey.

31:36.811 --> 31:38.521
Is it really okay for you to be here?

31:38.605 --> 31:40.356
Sure, just for a little while.

31:42.984 --> 31:44.986
Is that what you're presenting tomorrow?

31:46.070 --> 31:47.822
Well, yes.

31:48.406 --> 31:50.408
Can I see? I'm curious.

31:52.368 --> 31:53.369
Sure.

31:55.330 --> 31:56.915
It's nothing special.

31:56.998 --> 32:01.419
I'm just going to explain
what kind of piece I'm making.

32:04.714 --> 32:07.884
But honestly, I don't know
if I can really make it like that.

32:08.801 --> 32:11.888
-Gosh. This is so cool.
-This is so good.

32:18.853 --> 32:20.396
How do you come up with this?

32:21.147 --> 32:22.482
You're awesome.

32:23.441 --> 32:26.110
It's really nothing special.

32:26.194 --> 32:28.488
There are so many people better than me.

32:29.739 --> 32:31.783
Is there a good or bad for art, too?

32:31.866 --> 32:33.201
Of course.

32:33.868 --> 32:36.704
It's similar to cooking skills.

32:36.788 --> 32:38.873
You can have different tastes,

32:38.957 --> 32:42.752
but there's a clear line between
good food and bad food.

32:46.255 --> 32:48.299
I don't know much about art,

32:48.967 --> 32:51.469
but I like yours.
I have a good feeling about it.

32:56.724 --> 32:57.767
Really?

33:07.652 --> 33:08.987
This is so good.

33:09.070 --> 33:11.614
Can you explain how it tastes
in more detail?

33:15.159 --> 33:19.122
The noodles taste similar
to what your grandpa made,

33:19.205 --> 33:23.626
but the soup
is a bit more savory and light.

33:27.046 --> 33:28.423
Anyway, I like this one more.

33:30.383 --> 33:31.926
That's a relief.

33:32.010 --> 33:34.762
I want to brag about this to my grandpa.

33:34.846 --> 33:36.681
You shouldn't brag yet, though.

33:38.683 --> 33:40.184
Oh, right.

33:41.728 --> 33:42.770
Here.

33:42.854 --> 33:45.273
I just picked it up, thinking of you.

33:46.441 --> 33:48.276
Good luck with your presentation.

33:50.528 --> 33:51.487
What's this?

33:53.448 --> 33:54.991
Is it lipstick?

33:57.452 --> 33:58.661
A gift for me?

34:00.246 --> 34:01.289
Yes.

34:14.886 --> 34:15.887
How does it look?

34:16.637 --> 34:18.598
It looks good on you.

34:21.893 --> 34:22.727
Thanks.

34:24.520 --> 34:26.564
I'll do my best on my presentation.

34:27.190 --> 34:28.149
Do-hyeok.

34:28.733 --> 34:31.110
Right. Enjoy your food.

34:37.366 --> 34:39.118
We're here again.

34:39.202 --> 34:40.828
-Welcome.
-Welcome.

34:41.329 --> 34:42.413
Yes?

34:43.539 --> 34:46.084
You're all smiles.
Do you like her that much?

34:46.709 --> 34:47.919
What?

34:51.464 --> 34:53.049
Is it that obvious?

34:53.132 --> 34:54.383
Yes. Totally.

34:55.051 --> 34:56.803
She's going to find out soon.

34:58.054 --> 34:59.055
Here.

35:02.183 --> 35:03.309
On the house.

35:03.810 --> 35:06.145
-You shouldn't have.
-Go on, give it to her.

35:07.563 --> 35:09.398
But this heart's a bit…

35:09.482 --> 35:11.818
Should I make a circle, then? Just go.

35:12.985 --> 35:15.988
-Gosh…
-Come on. Don't be so shy.

35:25.623 --> 35:28.751
It's no problem.

35:50.189 --> 35:53.151
YU SE-HUN

35:56.821 --> 35:59.824
<i>Hey, Gyu-hyun.
You know where Bit-na lives, right?</i>

35:59.907 --> 36:01.868
<i>Text me her address.</i>

36:01.951 --> 36:03.369
Why?

36:03.452 --> 36:05.454
She's totally wasted.

36:05.538 --> 36:07.623
I'm going to send her home in a taxi.

36:07.707 --> 36:09.417
-<i>On the count of three.</i>
-What?

36:09.500 --> 36:12.503
You can come pick her up
if you have a problem with that.

36:12.587 --> 36:13.588
<i>So what will it be?</i>

36:13.671 --> 36:15.548
-<i>Hey!</i>
-Where are you? I'll be there.

36:15.631 --> 36:18.426
<i>What? Really? Didn't you say
you weren't feeling well?</i>

36:18.509 --> 36:20.344
I'm fine. Send me your location.

36:42.575 --> 36:44.994
What's happening?

36:49.582 --> 36:51.500
Who are you?

36:57.673 --> 36:58.799
Who is that?

37:04.847 --> 37:06.390
Darn it.

37:11.646 --> 37:13.105
Oh, my gosh.

37:13.189 --> 37:16.651
Gosh, you startled me!

37:20.112 --> 37:21.530
Let's go for another round.

37:21.614 --> 37:22.740
-Yes!
-Yes!

37:22.823 --> 37:24.033
After we send her home.

37:24.116 --> 37:26.911
No, we have to take her with us.
Bit-na, let's go.

37:26.994 --> 37:29.038
-Send her home.
-Bit-na, what's with you?

37:29.121 --> 37:30.915
-Get up.
-Where should we go?

37:31.582 --> 37:33.459
What? He took a taxi?

37:33.542 --> 37:35.795
-Did you come like that?
-This far?

37:35.878 --> 37:38.631
-Hey.
-It must have been expensive.

37:43.552 --> 37:45.972
Go on. I'll take Bit-na home.

37:46.055 --> 37:49.350
No! I can't let Bit-na go alone.
I'll come with you.

37:49.433 --> 37:51.435
Where are you going?
You're coming with me.

37:52.061 --> 37:54.355
-Hey!
-Right. I should go with you.

37:54.438 --> 37:56.315
-What are you looking at?
-Just go.

37:56.399 --> 37:59.402
Hey, thanks for this.

37:59.485 --> 38:01.404
Gosh, you reek of alcohol.

38:01.487 --> 38:03.739
Take her back safely,

38:03.823 --> 38:05.574
and send us a picture when you arrive.

38:05.658 --> 38:07.368
Go on.

38:07.451 --> 38:08.911
Stop that.

38:17.295 --> 38:18.296
Hey, Bit-na.

38:19.839 --> 38:20.923
Get up.

38:28.055 --> 38:29.640
Who are you?

38:29.724 --> 38:31.100
It's me.

38:34.603 --> 38:35.688
Get on my back.

38:43.279 --> 38:45.031
What? Are you crying?

38:45.781 --> 38:48.909
How can you do this to me, you jerk?

38:49.702 --> 38:53.372
Get lost! I don't want to touch
a traitor like you!

38:54.248 --> 38:55.708
What is it this time?

38:57.543 --> 38:59.920
What's the point of talking
to a drunk girl?

39:00.004 --> 39:01.881
Come on, get on my back.

39:04.050 --> 39:06.177
-You jerk.
-Hey! Have you lost it?

39:06.260 --> 39:08.471
You said you hated mint chocolate!

39:08.554 --> 39:10.389
You hate mint chocolate.

39:10.473 --> 39:13.392
-Did you like her that much?
-What?

39:13.476 --> 39:15.478
You jerk.

39:15.561 --> 39:18.147
You said you wanted to date me
only a while ago.

39:19.023 --> 39:22.234
Too bad you got rejected when
you even ate mint chocolate for her.

39:22.318 --> 39:23.944
It must be so agonizing.

39:24.028 --> 39:26.030
Who says I got rejected?

39:26.113 --> 39:29.450
Get lost. I'm not going to talk
to a guy who eats mint chocolate.

39:29.533 --> 39:32.244
What about you? You were
being so friendly with Mr. An.

39:32.328 --> 39:33.454
What? No way.

39:33.537 --> 39:35.873
Then why did you ignore me
at the bar last time?

39:35.956 --> 39:39.710
This is ridiculous. You were with
another guy back then too.

39:41.420 --> 39:42.838
Whatever.

39:45.549 --> 39:46.759
Stop crying.

39:51.764 --> 39:53.557
I didn't eat it because she asked to.

39:55.184 --> 39:59.146
I tried it because I heard
it's good for stress and insomnia.

39:59.980 --> 40:01.607
But it wasn't effective at all.

40:02.942 --> 40:05.778
I can't even sleep these days
because of you.

40:05.861 --> 40:08.364
That's nonsense!
Why would that be my fault?

40:11.075 --> 40:12.201
Well…

40:13.160 --> 40:16.664
I think of you every night.

40:20.084 --> 40:21.293
What?

40:22.753 --> 40:25.423
Why are you hitting on me now?

40:30.928 --> 40:32.179
Come here.

40:43.315 --> 40:44.817
Stop crying.

40:47.736 --> 40:49.280
Let's go. It's late.

40:51.449 --> 40:52.575
Let's go.

40:53.701 --> 40:54.994
Come on.

41:05.087 --> 41:06.172
There you go.

41:07.882 --> 41:09.008
Get on my back.

41:16.974 --> 41:21.562
Hey. Stop seeing other girls
and just go out with me.

41:22.688 --> 41:23.856
That's a lame line.

41:23.939 --> 41:27.151
Give me a break.
I've never asked someone out before.

41:28.486 --> 41:30.863
You better not go back
on your word tomorrow.

41:30.946 --> 41:32.156
I can't be sure.

41:33.782 --> 41:37.203
And why did you dye your hair like that?

41:38.120 --> 41:39.288
You're already so pretty.

41:40.456 --> 41:43.250
And stop drinking so much.

41:43.751 --> 41:47.171
You know how dangerous it is
to get wasted like that at night?

41:47.254 --> 41:49.340
-Jeez! Hey!
-What?

41:49.423 --> 41:53.093
Everything you say is so boring.

41:53.177 --> 41:55.095
But why are you such a good kisser?

41:55.179 --> 41:56.764
Right, I'm a good kisser.

41:58.432 --> 41:59.683
Let's go.

42:01.894 --> 42:02.937
Let's go!

43:05.916 --> 43:08.627
I think it's too much to the left.

43:08.711 --> 43:10.212
Move it more to the right.

43:10.296 --> 43:11.630
-All right!
-Okay.

43:11.714 --> 43:12.840
Just a little more.

43:14.675 --> 43:16.927
What? What is it?

43:17.011 --> 43:18.637
It's unbelievable.

43:18.721 --> 43:20.472
How could you have been living there?

43:20.556 --> 43:21.974
Hey!

43:22.057 --> 43:23.976
Is there something wrong?

43:24.059 --> 43:26.895
No, it's okay. It's perfect now.

43:29.023 --> 43:32.151
I'm only sleeping there until tonight.
So keep it a secret.

43:32.234 --> 43:33.402
What about after that?

43:36.405 --> 43:38.532
Just mind your own business.

43:38.616 --> 43:39.617
You know--

43:39.700 --> 43:42.870
No! I don't want to ask
my parents for help.

43:42.953 --> 43:44.204
You can stay at my house.

43:47.625 --> 43:50.210
My roommate went to the military
a while ago.

43:51.920 --> 43:55.174
What are you on about?
Are you asking me to live with you?

43:55.924 --> 43:58.677
You and me? That's total nonsense.

43:58.761 --> 44:00.262
Why? What about it?

44:00.929 --> 44:02.848
Lots of people do that in other countries.

44:05.351 --> 44:07.436
Well, that's true, but…

44:09.021 --> 44:10.272
Just think about it.

44:10.356 --> 44:12.858
Just pay the rent
you paid for your old house.

44:14.902 --> 44:18.739
Hey, raise the right side. The right side.

44:18.822 --> 44:20.157
My gosh.

44:21.575 --> 44:22.743
He's just too nice.

44:26.955 --> 44:28.415
Are you nervous?

44:29.583 --> 44:30.876
Yes, more than I thought.

44:33.921 --> 44:35.089
Look at me.

44:36.548 --> 44:38.175
Do I look better with my hair up?

44:43.555 --> 44:45.599
-There isn't much difference.
-Right?

44:45.683 --> 44:47.184
They're both pretty.

44:48.060 --> 44:50.062
Right. Did you get an assistant?

44:50.145 --> 44:54.316
The others seemed to be talking
about who they'll have as an assistant.

44:55.776 --> 44:56.652
Not yet.

44:57.444 --> 44:59.363
I should've done that too.

44:59.446 --> 45:01.281
What if nobody volunteers?

45:01.365 --> 45:02.950
I'm sure there will be volunteers.

45:06.036 --> 45:08.997
Oh, right. Sol was looking for you.

45:09.081 --> 45:10.499
Did you talk to her?

45:10.582 --> 45:13.627
No. I don't want to talk to her.

45:14.336 --> 45:16.422
What is it? Did something happen?

45:18.173 --> 45:19.425
You knew, right?

45:20.008 --> 45:22.886
You knew she decided not to leave
as an exchange student, right?

45:22.970 --> 45:24.263
I didn't.

45:25.055 --> 45:27.182
I didn't know. Did she say she's staying?

45:27.266 --> 45:28.267
You're so obvious.

45:30.727 --> 45:34.606
I'm trying to hold back until her
presentation's over, so I'm ignoring her.

45:34.690 --> 45:36.692
But this is driving me crazy.

45:38.235 --> 45:41.071
Good thinking. Just yell at her
once her presentation's over.

45:41.738 --> 45:43.323
She's so annoying!

45:43.407 --> 45:46.368
If she's treating me like this,
she shouldn't call me her bestie!

45:46.452 --> 45:50.497
She's making me feel
like I'm obsessing over her.

45:54.168 --> 45:55.210
I'm going.

45:55.919 --> 45:57.212
Good luck.

45:58.589 --> 45:59.673
Thanks.

46:00.674 --> 46:03.343
-You're the best, Na-bi.
-Thanks.

46:27.951 --> 46:31.079
I have to do my best on the presentation
and get an assistant.

46:31.163 --> 46:33.332
I'm sure you'll do well,

46:33.415 --> 46:35.751
but if you can't find one, I'll help you.

46:35.834 --> 46:37.669
<i>I'm good at taking orders.</i>

46:38.795 --> 46:41.840
Really? You promise, right?
You can't go back on your words.

46:42.633 --> 46:45.344
But what do I do if no one volunteers?

46:47.846 --> 46:49.223
I'm so worried.

46:50.891 --> 46:51.808
Oh, my gosh.

46:54.520 --> 46:57.397
Sorry, Do-hyeok. My friend is here.

46:57.481 --> 46:58.815
I'll call you again later.

47:00.984 --> 47:02.444
What was that for?

47:02.528 --> 47:05.030
-I was jealous.
-What?

47:05.739 --> 47:07.574
You look better with your hair up.

47:16.875 --> 47:18.335
How long are you going to avoid me?

47:19.378 --> 47:20.337
When did I avoid you?

47:21.547 --> 47:24.299
You're the one who ignored me
when we ran into each other.

47:26.009 --> 47:27.469
At the stairs?

47:28.387 --> 47:29.888
Did that bother you?

47:30.931 --> 47:32.349
I guess it worked.

47:35.602 --> 47:36.770
What are you on about?

47:39.064 --> 47:40.524
Good luck on your presentation.

47:52.411 --> 47:56.873
We will now begin the presentations
for the 12th Hongseo Gallery Exhibition.

47:56.957 --> 47:58.333
A round of applause, please.

48:02.796 --> 48:05.173
There are nine presenters today.

48:05.257 --> 48:07.175
We will select the assistants

48:07.259 --> 48:10.554
for each piece
after their presentations are over.

48:11.138 --> 48:15.309
The assistants will help the presenters
with their pieces.

48:15.392 --> 48:18.604
They will be helping them through
the entire process, starting from

48:18.687 --> 48:21.231
making the piece
up to preparing for the exhibition.

48:21.315 --> 48:23.942
It differs by each piece,

48:24.026 --> 48:26.236
but we recommend having

48:26.320 --> 48:29.698
around one to three assistants.

48:30.657 --> 48:33.201
There is a limit to the number
of volunteers,

48:33.702 --> 48:37.247
so even if there are many for your piece,
it's best not to use them all.

48:38.165 --> 48:41.627
The theme of my piece
is "observation of objects."

48:41.710 --> 48:44.546
What I want to express through my piece

48:44.630 --> 48:46.923
is human desire.

48:51.011 --> 48:53.639
Hello, I'm Yun Sol from
the Department of Sculpture.

48:53.722 --> 48:55.432
12TH HONGSEO GALLERY EXHIBITION
PRESENTATION BY YUN SOL

48:55.515 --> 48:58.852
The main theme of my piece is "union."

48:59.436 --> 49:02.564
The main material I used
is railway sleepers.

49:02.648 --> 49:05.692
The rigidity and the traces of endurance

49:05.776 --> 49:08.362
on abandoned sleepers
seemed very attractive.

49:08.862 --> 49:12.324
So I focused on emphasizing
the basic attributions of the material,

49:12.407 --> 49:14.409
such as the oil stains made over time.

49:14.993 --> 49:17.079
I wanted to make the materials

49:21.625 --> 49:22.918
seem attractive.

49:24.378 --> 49:25.337
Thank you.

49:28.048 --> 49:29.549
You're the best, Yun Sol!

49:29.633 --> 49:30.634
What?

49:33.178 --> 49:34.179
Good job.

49:37.015 --> 49:40.435
Next, Yu Na-bi from
the Department of Sculpture.

49:47.359 --> 49:49.820
Hello, I'm Yu Na-bi
from the Department of Sculpture.

49:49.903 --> 49:52.030
The theme of my piece is…

49:56.159 --> 49:57.244
Well…

49:59.454 --> 50:02.457
The theme of my piece is <i>"yeoji."</i>

50:03.542 --> 50:06.586
The Chinese characters
mean "left over" and "land."

50:06.670 --> 50:10.090
Thus, an empty area of land.

50:10.590 --> 50:13.844
It means a possibility or hope
of something happening.

50:15.595 --> 50:18.890
Cho Seong-sik from Sculpture
with the piece titled "coexistence."

50:19.808 --> 50:22.269
Raise your hand if you want to be
an assistant.

50:22.352 --> 50:24.855
-I want to do it.
-Me too.

50:24.938 --> 50:26.231
Me too.

50:26.314 --> 50:29.985
Cho Seong-sik?
Do you accept them as your assistants?

50:30.068 --> 50:31.403
-Yes.
-Come on out.

50:40.662 --> 50:44.666
Yu Na-bi from Sculpture
with the piece titled <i>"yeoji."</i>

50:44.750 --> 50:47.502
Who would like to assist Yu Na-bi?
Raise your hands.

50:51.673 --> 50:52.883
What?

51:03.310 --> 51:04.811
What? No way.

51:06.980 --> 51:11.318
Na-bi. Do you accept
Jae-eon as your assistant?

51:17.741 --> 51:18.992
Yes.

51:20.202 --> 51:22.287
-All right. If that's everyone--
-Me!

51:23.538 --> 51:24.664
I'll volunteer as well.

51:25.373 --> 51:27.667
Do you accept Hwang Jin-su
as your assistant?

51:27.751 --> 51:28.752
Yes, I do.

51:33.131 --> 51:34.591
All right. Come up.

51:52.067 --> 51:55.654
All right, then.
You should share your work schedules

51:55.737 --> 51:59.574
and related materials with your assistants

51:59.658 --> 52:01.034
before we finish up.

52:01.701 --> 52:04.830
The report format
is uploaded on our school website.

52:04.913 --> 52:06.998
-Make sure to check that.
-Okay.

52:07.082 --> 52:09.668
-Good job.
-Thank you!

52:12.671 --> 52:13.672
You tied your hair.

52:14.548 --> 52:17.843
Yes. It was a bit hot.

52:19.302 --> 52:21.179
Are you really going to do this?

52:22.305 --> 52:23.682
What do you mean?

52:23.765 --> 52:25.392
You really don't need to.

52:25.475 --> 52:26.893
I thought it'd be fun.

52:28.061 --> 52:29.479
I like your ideas.

52:29.563 --> 52:33.108
And it seems interesting to work
with metal.

52:35.652 --> 52:40.115
To be honest, I haven't worked with
metal before. So I'm not that skilled.

52:40.198 --> 52:43.159
I'll help you.
That's what assistants are for.

52:46.454 --> 52:48.164
You don't want to work with me?

52:48.832 --> 52:52.085
It's not like that, but…

52:52.168 --> 52:53.420
But?

52:53.503 --> 52:57.215
<i>I feel embarrassed
for not being able to believe</i>

52:57.299 --> 52:59.342
<i>-that he sincerely liked my piece.</i>
-Na-bi.

53:02.387 --> 53:04.222
I'm looking forward to working with you.

53:04.973 --> 53:07.601
-Thanks.
-I'm in an awesome team.

53:10.061 --> 53:11.688
Me too.

53:16.067 --> 53:17.235
Me too.

53:26.119 --> 53:27.996
Thanks for volunteering to assist me.

53:30.665 --> 53:32.208
Here are the materials.

53:38.173 --> 53:40.508
Do you both have time this evening?

53:41.843 --> 53:43.511
Drinks to celebrate becoming a team?

53:44.554 --> 53:46.348
I know a metalworking studio.

53:47.599 --> 53:48.558
Want to check it out?

53:50.185 --> 53:51.186
Yes!

53:54.689 --> 53:57.484
All right then.

54:25.595 --> 54:28.306
JAE-EON

54:43.822 --> 54:44.990
Come in.

54:52.414 --> 54:54.332
What? Why is there no one here?

54:54.916 --> 54:56.501
The owner got off work.

54:57.252 --> 55:00.171
I'm using his studio when it's not open.

55:01.506 --> 55:02.882
I live upstairs.

55:04.092 --> 55:05.218
I see.

55:06.469 --> 55:08.388
I didn't know you worked this hard.

55:09.931 --> 55:11.433
Aren't you overdoing it?

55:11.516 --> 55:12.976
I have a long way to go.

55:14.561 --> 55:17.022
<i>I envy his passion.</i>

55:23.319 --> 55:26.573
<i>I think I'll be about 30 minutes late.
Sorry.</i>

55:28.033 --> 55:29.659
Jin-su's going to be a bit late.

55:30.660 --> 55:31.995
Sit down.

55:46.676 --> 55:48.803
-Do you want a drink?
-Sure.

56:04.444 --> 56:06.404
It's been a while since we talked.

56:06.988 --> 56:08.531
It hasn't been that long.

56:16.206 --> 56:17.207
What?

56:20.668 --> 56:22.670
The day we went to the police station…

56:25.423 --> 56:26.674
I'm sorry.

56:28.259 --> 56:29.677
I shouldn't have done that to you.

56:30.887 --> 56:32.514
What's with the sudden apology?

56:32.597 --> 56:35.850
You were right about me drawing the line.

56:38.686 --> 56:41.189
When people cross a certain line,

56:42.649 --> 56:44.859
they feel like it's meaningless.

56:46.528 --> 56:47.737
But…

56:48.738 --> 56:50.490
I want to change now.

56:54.410 --> 56:56.830
<i>I should stop reading too much
into his words now.</i>

56:57.539 --> 57:00.500
Change how?
Are you thinking of dating now?

57:03.169 --> 57:04.254
I'm not sure.

57:06.131 --> 57:09.759
I'm thinking of changing bit by bit.

57:10.552 --> 57:12.053
Then who knows?

57:12.679 --> 57:14.305
I might meet my soulmate.

57:17.767 --> 57:19.644
I'll be rooting for you, then.

57:21.354 --> 57:23.356
I hope you can be sincere this time.

57:59.976 --> 58:02.812
You can adjust the fire with this.

58:11.154 --> 58:13.031
Be careful. It's hot.

58:14.657 --> 58:16.951
Start from the middle and go to the edge.

58:24.167 --> 58:26.753
Start here and straighten it out
little by little.

58:31.883 --> 58:33.259
It's not straightening out.

58:33.343 --> 58:34.594
Hit it harder.

58:45.021 --> 58:46.439
-It's flat, right?
-Cool.

58:50.944 --> 58:53.238
-Yes, like that.
-It's getting flat.

58:53.321 --> 58:55.156
Good. You're getting better.

59:03.206 --> 59:06.751
Jin-su said he'd be 30 minutes late,
but he never came.

59:09.295 --> 59:11.881
How was it?
It wasn't that difficult, right?

59:13.132 --> 59:14.217
Right.

59:14.926 --> 59:16.970
I think I can do it if I work hard.

59:17.053 --> 59:19.973
Call me whenever you want to work.
You'll make a masterpiece.

59:20.056 --> 59:21.432
Stop teasing me.

59:21.516 --> 59:24.102
I'm not teasing you. I like your pieces.

59:24.769 --> 59:27.313
Especially this one.
I'm looking forward to it.

59:29.941 --> 59:32.360
I didn't know you liked it that much.

59:35.613 --> 59:36.864
I'll get going.

59:38.866 --> 59:40.034
Na-bi.

59:45.707 --> 59:47.375
I changed my number.

59:57.510 --> 59:58.636
Bye.

1:00:11.065 --> 1:00:12.609
MISSED CALLS
SEOL-A

1:00:36.382 --> 1:00:38.092
<i>-Hey, Seol-a.</i>
-Hey.

1:00:38.176 --> 1:00:39.427
Were you waiting for me?

1:00:41.554 --> 1:00:42.639
No.

1:00:43.514 --> 1:00:47.185
I just called to say
I can't make it today.

1:00:47.769 --> 1:00:50.271
-That's a relief.
-Were you busy?

1:00:50.355 --> 1:00:52.273
Yes, a bit. I was working.

1:00:53.524 --> 1:00:54.609
All right.

1:00:56.277 --> 1:00:57.654
Go back to work, then.

1:01:12.251 --> 1:01:14.003
I like your pieces.

1:01:14.087 --> 1:01:17.674
Especially this one.
I'm looking forward to it.

1:03:09.702 --> 1:03:13.289
So is this crumbling down,

1:03:13.372 --> 1:03:15.082
or being made?

1:03:16.751 --> 1:03:18.211
That's up to interpretation.

1:03:24.926 --> 1:03:26.427
It's good.

1:03:29.847 --> 1:03:32.058
Na-bi seems to have gained
her focus again.

1:03:32.642 --> 1:03:33.976
Thank you.

1:03:34.060 --> 1:03:37.313
It's so cool. Just a few days ago,
there was nothing.

1:03:39.398 --> 1:03:43.820
Bit-na. When are you
going to show me your piece?

1:03:46.781 --> 1:03:49.784
Focus on your work, okay?

1:03:49.867 --> 1:03:52.286
Bit-na, let me see you work properly!

1:03:52.370 --> 1:03:54.038
Where is she going?

1:03:55.289 --> 1:03:56.541
This is great.

1:04:17.770 --> 1:04:20.189
Doesn't Jae-eon seem a bit different?

1:04:21.190 --> 1:04:22.692
He seems a bit purer.

1:04:22.775 --> 1:04:25.319
Right. He seems different somehow.

1:04:25.403 --> 1:04:27.446
I heard he doesn't hang out with girls.

1:04:27.530 --> 1:04:29.615
What happened to him?

1:04:30.950 --> 1:04:32.869
Is he dating someone for real now?

1:04:32.952 --> 1:04:36.622
How would we ever understand the life
of a handsome guy?

1:04:36.706 --> 1:04:38.666
-Good work.
-Good work.

1:04:42.211 --> 1:04:43.546
-Give me one too.
-Here.

1:04:44.297 --> 1:04:45.882
-Here you go.
-Have one.

1:04:47.133 --> 1:04:49.135
-You try this.
-It's good.

1:05:01.314 --> 1:05:03.065
-You want to make wings?
-Yes.

1:05:03.691 --> 1:05:07.361
But I don't know what kind of shape
I should make it into.

1:05:11.782 --> 1:05:13.951
I should print this one.

1:05:41.687 --> 1:05:43.814
FOR REFERENCE

1:05:43.898 --> 1:05:46.233
I wish I could see this in person.

1:05:46.317 --> 1:05:49.111
-You can.
-How?

1:05:49.195 --> 1:05:51.322
This artist's having an exhibition.

1:05:51.405 --> 1:05:53.532
It opens next week. Do you want to go?

1:05:55.993 --> 1:05:57.244
Sure. Let's do that.

1:05:57.328 --> 1:05:58.788
Hey, Jin-su.

1:06:03.417 --> 1:06:04.961
He's sleeping again.

1:06:05.544 --> 1:06:08.381
<i>Our relationship took a new turn,</i>

1:06:08.464 --> 1:06:12.802
<i>and I found peace in my mind
within that friendly relationship.</i>

1:06:16.180 --> 1:06:17.974
Yes, I'm here.

1:06:18.641 --> 1:06:19.767
Just because.

1:06:24.605 --> 1:06:26.440
I thought I should cut my hair.

1:06:26.524 --> 1:06:30.945
I didn't go to a hair shop in America,
so it got kind of messy.

1:06:32.363 --> 1:06:34.949
Really? Should I cut it short, then?

1:06:37.451 --> 1:06:39.912
I guess I'll do that. All right.

1:06:39.996 --> 1:06:41.247
I'll see you tomorrow.

1:06:48.212 --> 1:06:49.755
I'll get it for you…

1:06:58.597 --> 1:06:59.807
Thanks.

1:07:04.645 --> 1:07:07.064
Are you Yu Na-bi, by any chance?

1:07:07.648 --> 1:07:09.275
Do you know me?

1:07:09.358 --> 1:07:12.486
Jae-eon said you were a friend
in the same department.

1:07:15.489 --> 1:07:16.323
Right.

1:07:17.366 --> 1:07:18.993
Are you here to see Jae-eon?

1:07:19.827 --> 1:07:23.205
Yes. I just came
because I wanted to see him.

1:07:23.831 --> 1:07:26.876
He's probably busy.
We have a lot of assignments.

1:07:26.959 --> 1:07:28.169
Really?

1:07:29.336 --> 1:07:31.964
He said he'd come out.
I feel kind of sorry now.

1:07:38.804 --> 1:07:40.056
Hey, Jae-eon.

1:07:41.348 --> 1:07:42.516
Oh, really?

1:07:43.976 --> 1:07:45.561
It's fine. Take your time.

1:07:47.271 --> 1:07:48.981
I don't smoke that much.

1:07:50.524 --> 1:07:52.109
All right.

1:07:56.822 --> 1:08:00.785
Excuse me,
but what's your relationship with Jae-eon?

1:08:01.577 --> 1:08:03.245
We used to date.

1:08:05.372 --> 1:08:06.499
I see.

1:08:10.920 --> 1:08:12.004
And…

1:08:14.215 --> 1:08:16.092
we're seeing each other again.

1:08:23.516 --> 1:08:27.686
But are you really just friends with him?

1:08:35.611 --> 1:08:37.905
Yes. We're just friends.

1:08:39.365 --> 1:08:40.825
That's a relief.

1:08:40.908 --> 1:08:43.244
I thought maybe I said something
I shouldn't have.

1:08:54.755 --> 1:08:55.756
You should

1:08:57.216 --> 1:08:58.843
just keep your hair that way.

1:08:59.885 --> 1:09:00.719
What?

1:09:02.096 --> 1:09:06.058
Jae-eon likes doing it
with your hair tied.

1:10:03.115 --> 1:10:07.578
<i>A distance that's close enough
yet not too close to hurt each other.</i>

1:10:07.661 --> 1:10:10.456
<i>Jae-eon likes doing it
with your hair tied.</i>

1:10:10.539 --> 1:10:12.583
-Na-bi is coming?
-You didn't know?

1:10:12.666 --> 1:10:14.460
<i>She disappeared.</i>

1:10:14.543 --> 1:10:16.545
<i>That's what you hate the most.</i>

1:10:16.629 --> 1:10:18.339
<i>Getting clingy.</i>

1:10:18.422 --> 1:10:20.049
<i>Certainty about the relationship.</i>

1:10:20.132 --> 1:10:22.509
How does one get that certainty?

1:10:22.593 --> 1:10:24.678
<i>I didn't know you'd be coming along.</i>

1:10:24.762 --> 1:10:27.181
I've always wanted to come here.

1:10:27.264 --> 1:10:28.098
Cheers.

1:10:28.182 --> 1:10:30.851
<i>Then is it over with him now?</i>

1:10:30.935 --> 1:10:32.686
<i>It must be someone you like.</i>

1:10:32.770 --> 1:10:34.355
<i>No, just someone bothersome.</i>

1:10:34.438 --> 1:10:37.691
<i>I know very well that a person
who doesn't know how to love someone</i>

1:10:37.775 --> 1:10:38.817
<i>can never be happy.</i>

1:10:39.485 --> 1:10:40.319
<i>You're coming here?</i>

1:10:40.402 --> 1:10:43.405
<i>Hello. I'm Park Jae-eon.</i>

1:10:43.489 --> 1:10:47.618
