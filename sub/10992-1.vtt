05:05.467 --> 05:06.499
Yes?

05:06.500 --> 05:10.200
We're ready for you,
miss Crawford.

05:15.133 --> 05:16.667
Let's go.

05:19.167 --> 05:22.132
And on our left,
just up the hill,

05:22.133 --> 05:25.132
the palatial home
of movie queen Joan Crawford,

05:25.133 --> 05:28.900
whose new movie,
<i>ice follies 1939...</i>

05:43.267 --> 05:44.267
Excuse me.

05:46.367 --> 05:49.866
Helga's finished in the
living room, miss Crawford.

05:49.867 --> 05:51.133
Oh, good.

06:27.500 --> 06:30.599
Carol Ann, help me with this.

06:30.600 --> 06:32.000
Ohh.

06:33.267 --> 06:34.766
Helga...

06:34.767 --> 06:39.766
When you Polish the floor,
you have to move the tree.

06:39.767 --> 06:42.766
If you can't do something
right, don't do it at all.

06:42.767 --> 06:44.266
I'm sorry, miss Crawford.

06:44.267 --> 06:46.266
Give me the soap.

06:46.267 --> 06:47.732
You see, Carol Ann,

06:47.733 --> 06:51.733
you have to stay on top of
things every single minute.

06:54.733 --> 06:56.766
Carol Ann, will you get that?

06:56.767 --> 06:58.066
Yes, miss Crawford.

06:58.067 --> 07:00.932
Helga, I'm not mad at you,
I'm mad at the dirt.

07:00.933 --> 07:02.132
Come on. Yes, ma'am.

07:02.133 --> 07:04.032
Hello, Carol Ann.

07:04.033 --> 07:05.732
Oh, Mr. Savitt. Come in.

07:05.733 --> 07:08.599
Greg, you're early.

07:08.600 --> 07:10.599
Only an hour and a half.

07:10.600 --> 07:12.199
Well, take your shoes off.

07:12.200 --> 07:14.333
I've just washed that floor.

07:20.667 --> 07:22.800
What about the socks?

07:34.367 --> 07:37.033
I can handle the socks.

08:26.633 --> 08:28.067
Hello, bridget.

08:30.733 --> 08:35.332
Miss Crawford, words cannot
express our gratitude

08:35.332 --> 08:40.666
for the happiness
you bring our children.

08:40.667 --> 08:43.765
No. I'm the one who's
grateful, reverend mother.

08:43.767 --> 08:47.366
Being here with you and
the children at Christmas

08:47.367 --> 08:50.432
is one of the things
I most look forward to.

08:50.433 --> 08:51.967
Bridget, look.

08:54.100 --> 08:55.299
Be careful.

08:55.300 --> 08:56.933
Merry Christmas, bridget.

09:06.600 --> 09:09.699
You know what's missing
in my life?

09:09.700 --> 09:11.266
A hit movie.

09:11.267 --> 09:12.466
Come on.

09:12.467 --> 09:14.566
You've got everything you want.

09:14.567 --> 09:17.632
No, I don't. I want a baby.

09:17.633 --> 09:19.099
A baby?

09:19.100 --> 09:20.299
Yeah.

09:20.300 --> 09:22.832
You know I've always
wanted a kid.

09:22.833 --> 09:25.367
You're too vain to be pregnant.

09:26.467 --> 09:28.499
Vain.

09:28.500 --> 09:31.599
I can't have one.

09:31.600 --> 09:34.632
I was pregnant seven
times with franchot.

09:34.633 --> 09:36.600
I lost them all.

09:38.300 --> 09:40.799
I'm going to adopt one.

09:40.800 --> 09:43.432
Out of the question.

09:43.433 --> 09:45.132
What do you mean?

09:45.133 --> 09:47.666
I mean no agency
would give you a baby.

09:47.667 --> 09:48.999
How do you know?

09:49.000 --> 09:50.366
I'm a lawyer.

09:50.367 --> 09:51.732
Bend the law.

09:51.733 --> 09:53.199
Bend the law?

09:53.200 --> 09:55.832
Joan, you're an actress.
You've been divorced twice.

09:55.833 --> 09:57.599
Adoption agencies
can be brutal.

09:57.600 --> 10:00.232
Besides, a baby needs a father.

10:00.233 --> 10:01.633
A father.

10:04.067 --> 10:05.600
A father...

10:08.667 --> 10:10.566
I never had a father.

10:10.567 --> 10:13.799
Ma changed husbands faster
than she changed bed sheets.

10:13.800 --> 10:17.533
Ma, with her sloppiness
and her dirt.

10:19.633 --> 10:22.166
You know, hard times is good for people.
I tell you it is.

10:22.167 --> 10:24.132
Would I be where I am
if I hadn't had them?

10:24.133 --> 10:26.132
I could be a mother
and a father.

10:26.133 --> 10:28.799
I know how to teach a kid
to take care of himself

10:28.800 --> 10:31.432
and amount to something.
I know I could.

10:31.433 --> 10:32.932
Maybe you could.

10:32.933 --> 10:34.466
One thing's certain.

10:34.467 --> 10:36.532
You'd sure get
a lot of publicity.

10:36.533 --> 10:37.900
Don't you...

10:39.500 --> 10:40.500
bastard.

10:41.900 --> 10:45.766
You guys in Hollywood, all you
think about is publicity,

10:45.767 --> 10:48.066
deals, box office.

10:48.067 --> 10:51.633
Why don't you try
to understand a woman?

10:54.267 --> 10:58.766
I'm afraid I have some difficult
news for you, miss Crawford.

10:58.767 --> 11:02.632
The agency has denied your
application for adoption.

11:02.633 --> 11:04.567
But why?

11:05.733 --> 11:08.832
Well... You live alone.

11:08.833 --> 11:12.199
There's no other
family member in the home.

11:12.200 --> 11:16.232
You have two previous divorces.

11:16.233 --> 11:17.932
You're a busy, active woman,

11:17.933 --> 11:21.600
"and the candidate is found
to be an unsuitable parent."

11:24.267 --> 11:26.033
Unsuitable?

11:27.333 --> 11:28.899
Please, miss Crawford.

11:28.900 --> 11:31.532
Don't you dare judge me!

11:31.533 --> 11:34.399
We have a moral and legal
responsibility in this job.

11:34.400 --> 11:35.899
Obviously you don't understand.

11:35.900 --> 11:39.532
What you're really doing is
denying one of your children

11:39.533 --> 11:44.600
the opportunity to live a
wonderful and advantaged life.

11:48.833 --> 11:50.667
How sad that is.

11:53.533 --> 11:55.133
Good afternoon.

11:58.667 --> 12:00.732
Do I look all right?

12:00.733 --> 12:02.132
Am I dressed right?

12:02.133 --> 12:05.132
Oh, for god's sake, Joan.

12:05.133 --> 12:07.099
Everything...

12:07.100 --> 12:08.533
Perfect.

12:09.867 --> 12:11.632
Perfect.

12:11.633 --> 12:14.132
The kid's only
a couple of months old.

12:14.133 --> 12:16.632
It's not going to know.

12:16.633 --> 12:17.699
<i>I </i> know.

12:17.700 --> 12:19.266
Why aren't they here?

12:19.267 --> 12:20.799
I don't know.

12:20.800 --> 12:21.832
Greg, darling,
please don't drink.

12:21.833 --> 12:23.632
I don't want whiskey
on your breath.

12:23.633 --> 12:25.666
Damn it, Joan,
I got you the baby.

12:25.667 --> 12:26.967
It's yours! You have it.

12:28.667 --> 12:30.333
I know.

12:31.833 --> 12:33.000
They're here.

12:37.733 --> 12:38.932
Hello.

12:38.933 --> 12:40.667
Please, this way.

12:56.033 --> 12:58.066
We're so pleased,
miss Crawford.

12:58.067 --> 12:59.599
Thank you, doctor.

12:59.600 --> 13:01.067
Thank you.

13:02.667 --> 13:04.033
Hello.

13:09.733 --> 13:11.867
Oh, Greg.

13:14.367 --> 13:15.867
She's perfect.

13:17.733 --> 13:19.600
You're perfect.

13:23.767 --> 13:25.567
A daughter.

13:31.733 --> 13:33.899
My own...

13:33.900 --> 13:35.933
Daughter.

14:14.867 --> 14:19.332
I'm going to make
a perfect life for you.

14:19.333 --> 14:25.799
I'm going to give you all
the things I never had.

14:25.800 --> 14:29.800
My beautiful little darling.

14:33.800 --> 14:34.800
Oh...

14:36.800 --> 14:38.832
You're a lucky little girl...

14:38.833 --> 14:40.832
And very expensive.

14:40.833 --> 14:43.800
You cost me a lot of favors.

14:49.833 --> 14:51.800
I'm going to call you...

14:54.300 --> 14:55.533
Christina.

14:57.500 --> 14:59.300
Christina, darling...

15:00.333 --> 15:03.500
My darling daughter.

15:06.267 --> 15:07.733
My own...

15:10.867 --> 15:13.433
Christina Crawford.

15:59.800 --> 16:03.100
Are you having a happy
birthday, Christina, darling?

16:05.733 --> 16:08.999
This is the best party
I ever had.

16:09.000 --> 16:11.032
I love you, mommie dearest.

16:11.033 --> 16:13.067
I love you, Tina, darling.

16:17.733 --> 16:19.100
Up.

16:25.967 --> 16:27.999
Here's your mommie.

16:28.000 --> 16:29.667
Hello.

16:31.067 --> 16:32.632
This is Christopher,

16:32.633 --> 16:34.199
my second child.

16:34.200 --> 16:38.299
I would like to adopt every
unwanted child in the world.

16:38.300 --> 16:40.366
No one should be unwanted.

16:40.367 --> 16:42.567
Oh, look at that, darling.

16:44.500 --> 16:47.599
Life is tough enough
when you are wanted,

16:47.600 --> 16:48.799
isn't it?

16:48.800 --> 16:50.966
It's time for his nap.

16:50.967 --> 16:52.232
He's sleepy.

16:52.233 --> 16:54.900
Have nanny
tuck him in properly.

16:57.800 --> 16:59.433
Christina.

17:02.867 --> 17:04.531
Come...

17:04.532 --> 17:06.499
Birthday girl.

17:06.500 --> 17:08.665
Now, what do you think?

17:08.666 --> 17:10.632
Shall we open the presents now?

17:10.633 --> 17:11.665
Yes.

17:11.666 --> 17:14.132
You think it's about time to?

17:14.133 --> 17:15.132
Yes!

17:15.133 --> 17:16.665
I'm not so sure.

17:16.666 --> 17:17.632
Oh, please?

17:17.633 --> 17:19.132
They're right there.

17:19.133 --> 17:20.732
Miss Crawford.

17:20.733 --> 17:23.632
The studio would like
some shots of you

17:23.633 --> 17:25.165
watching Christina
open presents.

17:25.166 --> 17:27.398
All right, Jimmy.

17:27.400 --> 17:28.866
Come on, darling.

17:28.867 --> 17:31.467
Oh, I have a grass stain.

17:32.767 --> 17:35.232
Oh, darling,
that will never show.

17:35.233 --> 17:38.732
I'll just run upstairs and
have nanny take care of it.

17:38.733 --> 17:40.632
No, dear. We'll take
the photographs now.

17:40.633 --> 17:43.133
Actually, miss Crawford,
it might read.

17:48.667 --> 17:50.632
All right, dear, go along.

17:50.633 --> 17:52.166
Have nanny fix it.

17:52.167 --> 17:54.633
We'll wait for you here.

17:58.667 --> 18:00.699
O.K., Christina.

18:00.700 --> 18:02.667
Hold it a little more.

18:03.700 --> 18:05.166
Big smile, Christina.

18:05.167 --> 18:06.432
O.K., Christina.

18:06.433 --> 18:08.332
Wide smile now, wide eyes.

18:08.333 --> 18:10.832
A little to your right,
Christina.

18:10.833 --> 18:13.566
Now hang on, Christina.

18:13.567 --> 18:14.999
Beautiful!

18:15.000 --> 18:17.232
She's a real natural,
miss Crawford.

18:17.233 --> 18:19.232
I think that's enough now, hmm?

18:19.233 --> 18:21.766
Tina, run down and get
the other children.

18:21.767 --> 18:24.700
Tell them to come up. We'll
open the presents for real.

18:26.200 --> 18:28.566
Miss Crawford, I promised the
studio some real good stuff

18:28.567 --> 18:29.999
when she blows out the candles.

18:30.000 --> 18:31.267
All right, Jimmy.

18:39.600 --> 18:41.799
Oh, mommie,

18:41.800 --> 18:43.332
thank you.

18:43.333 --> 18:46.832
She's so beautiful.

18:46.833 --> 18:49.200
What should I name her?

18:50.600 --> 18:53.566
Is that the present
you like best?

18:53.567 --> 18:55.567
Oh, yes.

18:56.600 --> 19:00.166
Then that's the present
you can keep.

19:00.167 --> 19:01.999
We'll take the rest

19:02.000 --> 19:05.766
to the orphans
who don't have anything.

19:05.767 --> 19:09.799
And tomorrow we'll write
our thank-you notes.

19:09.800 --> 19:11.667
Oh.

19:13.233 --> 19:16.100
Christina, why can't you...

19:19.467 --> 19:20.733
Hello, hello.

19:22.167 --> 19:25.100
Happy birthday, darling.

19:27.367 --> 19:28.899
Oh, hello, darling.

19:28.900 --> 19:30.132
Darling.

19:30.133 --> 19:32.699
Oh, uncle Greg.

19:32.700 --> 19:34.766
It's just what I wanted.

19:34.767 --> 19:36.466
You like it?

19:36.467 --> 19:37.899
I love it.

19:37.900 --> 19:39.099
Look.

19:39.100 --> 19:40.599
Oh, but, you see,

19:40.600 --> 19:43.732
I'm only keeping one present,

19:43.733 --> 19:47.866
and all the rest I'm going
to give to the poor orphans.

19:47.867 --> 19:51.666
Yes, I... I read about that
in the newspapers.

19:51.667 --> 19:53.199
It's... it's wonderful.

19:53.200 --> 19:57.332
So I'll just keep this for you

19:57.333 --> 20:01.466
until you don't have to choose.

20:01.467 --> 20:04.532
I put a lot of thought
into this

20:04.533 --> 20:06.533
when I picked it for you.

20:11.767 --> 20:13.467
All right.

20:15.433 --> 20:19.032
This time we'll make
an exception.

20:19.033 --> 20:22.132
You may keep the doll...

20:22.133 --> 20:24.199
And the bracelet.

20:24.200 --> 20:26.200
Oh, mommie dearest.

20:29.867 --> 20:31.932
Mmm.

20:31.933 --> 20:34.133
What about
Christopher's present?

20:36.433 --> 20:37.632
This one.

20:37.633 --> 20:41.766
Darling, remember
what I told you

20:41.767 --> 20:44.332
about adopted children?

20:44.333 --> 20:46.899
Adopted children are luckiest

20:46.900 --> 20:49.032
'cause they were chosen.

20:49.033 --> 20:50.300
That's right.

20:56.000 --> 20:57.532
Well, that's good,

20:57.533 --> 21:00.932
but you've got to push off
more with your weight.

21:00.933 --> 21:03.466
Come on, let's see another one.

21:03.467 --> 21:04.932
She's had enough, Joan.

21:04.933 --> 21:07.032
But I'm tired, mommie.

21:07.033 --> 21:08.400
Quitter.

21:14.467 --> 21:16.632
All right, ready?

21:16.633 --> 21:18.932
1, 2, 3...

21:18.933 --> 21:20.067
Dive!

21:21.833 --> 21:24.832
Better, but you've got to
keep your legs together

21:24.833 --> 21:27.332
when you go in the water.

21:27.333 --> 21:29.466
She's only a kid.

21:29.467 --> 21:33.599
So was I... only a kid.

21:33.600 --> 21:35.599
I learned early.

21:35.600 --> 21:38.132
Life goes by too damn fast.

21:38.133 --> 21:41.632
You've got to know how
to compete and win.

21:41.633 --> 21:45.599
I don't want her growing up
a spoiled Hollywood brat,

21:45.600 --> 21:47.567
just because she's
Crawford's daughter.

21:51.967 --> 21:54.466
Ah... It's lovely.

21:54.467 --> 21:55.466
Isn't it?

21:55.467 --> 21:56.966
Yes, it is.

21:56.967 --> 21:59.432
It's a great Sunday at home...

21:59.433 --> 22:00.899
With a star.

22:00.900 --> 22:02.399
Oh... Ha ha.

22:02.400 --> 22:06.867
You know, we hardly ever have
nice days like this anymore.

22:08.900 --> 22:10.367
I've got an appointment.

22:12.400 --> 22:15.466
They call, you run.

22:15.467 --> 22:18.500
Who calls, I run?

22:20.900 --> 22:22.500
Nobody.

22:26.400 --> 22:28.899
Then why do you say that?

22:28.900 --> 22:31.366
Because I'm damn mad at you!

22:31.367 --> 22:32.699
Why?

22:32.700 --> 22:35.366
Look, this script is the
best script the studio has,

22:35.367 --> 22:37.899
and it hasn't been
offered to me.

22:37.900 --> 22:39.399
You could help.

22:39.400 --> 22:40.866
Joan, that's Mayer's business.

22:40.867 --> 22:44.866
I never tell a man I respect
how to run his business.

22:44.867 --> 22:46.633
They think I'm slipping.

22:48.867 --> 22:50.266
Are you?

22:50.267 --> 22:51.399
No.

22:51.400 --> 22:52.867
So?

22:56.200 --> 22:57.200
Yes.

23:02.300 --> 23:05.800
I just want that part.

23:07.333 --> 23:09.299
Mm-hmm.

23:09.300 --> 23:11.999
I want you, too.

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
You got me.

23:28.833 --> 23:30.966
Have a good time, Tina.

23:30.967 --> 23:32.932
Thanks, uncle Greg.

23:32.933 --> 23:34.432
I love you.

23:34.433 --> 23:35.800
Ah...

23:42.333 --> 23:44.232
Who wants to go swimming?

23:44.233 --> 23:45.433
I do!

23:46.833 --> 23:48.266
I'll race you.

23:48.267 --> 23:49.732
On your mark,

23:49.733 --> 23:51.166
get set,

23:51.167 --> 23:52.333
go!

24:11.567 --> 24:12.600
Again?

24:17.667 --> 24:20.632
I'll give you
a bigger head start.

24:20.633 --> 24:22.433
Come on, Tina.

24:30.767 --> 24:32.266
On your mark,

24:32.267 --> 24:35.299
get set...

24:35.300 --> 24:36.467
And go!

25:00.867 --> 25:03.566
Ah, you lost again.

25:03.567 --> 25:05.199
It's not fair.

25:05.200 --> 25:07.232
You're bigger than I am.

25:07.233 --> 25:09.599
It's not fair to win twice.

25:09.600 --> 25:15.232
Ah, but nobody ever said
that life was fair, Tina.

25:15.233 --> 25:17.932
I'm bigger, and I'm faster.

25:17.933 --> 25:19.967
I will always beat you.

25:21.667 --> 25:24.566
Then I'm not going
to play with you anymore.

25:24.567 --> 25:25.533
Ever!

25:26.733 --> 25:29.732
Don't you <i> ever</i>

25:29.733 --> 25:32.699
use that tone of voice
with me, missy!

25:32.700 --> 25:35.732
Who do you think
you're talking to?

25:35.733 --> 25:38.732
I'll tell you
what you're going to do.

25:38.733 --> 25:41.732
You're going to march yourself
upstairs to your room

25:41.733 --> 25:44.066
and you will stay there until
I tell you to come out!

25:44.067 --> 25:45.999
No, I won't!

25:46.000 --> 25:48.767
No, you won't?

25:50.200 --> 25:53.432
Yes, you will!

25:53.433 --> 25:54.932
Ow! Ow!

25:54.933 --> 25:56.299
Now, go up...

25:56.300 --> 25:57.566
I won't go!

25:57.567 --> 25:58.932
All right, all right!

25:58.933 --> 26:00.332
I won't go!

26:00.333 --> 26:02.766
You will stay in here until
you are ready to behave...

26:02.767 --> 26:04.166
I won't!

26:04.167 --> 26:06.132
And to apologize!

26:06.133 --> 26:07.332
I won't!

26:07.333 --> 26:08.632
In!

26:08.633 --> 26:10.999
Aah!

26:11.000 --> 26:12.000
Mommie!

26:31.400 --> 26:35.266
Fans should know
the price you pay.

26:35.267 --> 26:38.233
Mayer should know
the price I pay.

26:42.167 --> 26:45.166
The biggest
female star he's got,

26:45.167 --> 26:47.166
ever had,

26:47.167 --> 26:49.166
and he's burying me alive.

26:49.167 --> 26:51.199
He's not going to beat me.

26:51.200 --> 26:54.699
I will survive. I will survive.
I will survive.

26:54.700 --> 26:58.833
I will survive. I will survive.
I will survive.

27:10.600 --> 27:12.066
Where's Tina?

27:12.067 --> 27:15.099
She'll be down in a
minute, miss Crawford.

27:15.100 --> 27:17.067
Hello, darling.

27:18.567 --> 27:20.067
Oh, god.

27:39.067 --> 27:40.366
Hello.

27:40.367 --> 27:42.332
Oh...

27:42.333 --> 27:44.799
Oh, yes, sir. Joan.

27:44.800 --> 27:46.032
Who?

27:46.033 --> 27:47.966
At this hour?

27:47.967 --> 27:49.466
It's Mr. Savitt

27:49.467 --> 27:51.967
calling from
Mr. Mayer's office.

27:55.567 --> 27:57.432
Greg, darling...

27:57.433 --> 27:58.932
Hello.

27:58.933 --> 28:01.766
Is anything wrong?

28:01.767 --> 28:04.266
We had to settle
a little labor problem,

28:04.267 --> 28:06.699
so we had to set
a little early meeting.

28:06.700 --> 28:08.032
By the way,

28:08.033 --> 28:11.766
Mayer thinks you'd be wonderful
in the picture you wanted.

28:11.767 --> 28:13.032
What? Wh-what, Greg?

28:13.033 --> 28:17.032
I tried to talk him out
of it, but I couldn't.

28:17.033 --> 28:19.699
Oh, Greg! No, Greg, wait!

28:19.700 --> 28:20.899
Good-bye.

28:20.900 --> 28:23.966
No, Greg!

28:23.967 --> 28:25.032
Wait, Greg!

28:25.033 --> 28:26.099
Oh!

28:26.100 --> 28:27.366
Greg!

28:27.367 --> 28:29.266
Carol Ann!

28:29.267 --> 28:30.999
Oh!

28:31.000 --> 28:32.266
I've got it!

28:32.267 --> 28:33.499
Oh!

28:33.500 --> 28:34.600
I've got it!

28:35.967 --> 28:38.166
I've got it!

28:38.167 --> 28:39.799
I've got it!

28:39.800 --> 28:41.967
Ahhh!

28:44.033 --> 28:45.832
Christina!

28:45.833 --> 28:47.600
Christina, darling, guess what.

28:50.833 --> 28:52.199
Oh, yes...

28:52.200 --> 28:54.199
It was thrilling.

28:54.200 --> 28:57.099
I'm so grateful to you all,

28:57.100 --> 28:59.932
my wonderful fans...

28:59.933 --> 29:02.100
Who've made me a star.

29:03.967 --> 29:06.966
Oh, yes. It was thrilling.

29:06.967 --> 29:09.966
I'm so grateful to you all.

29:09.967 --> 29:16.200
My wonderful fans who
have made me a star!

29:19.967 --> 29:20.933
Mommie!

29:24.467 --> 29:26.932
What do you think you're doing?

29:26.933 --> 29:29.132
Nothing, mommie.

29:29.133 --> 29:31.767
I was just... just playing.

29:33.967 --> 29:35.933
What do you mean, playing?

29:38.933 --> 29:40.700
Pawing through my things...

29:43.467 --> 29:45.466
Making fun of me?

29:45.467 --> 29:47.932
I wasn't making fun of you.

29:47.933 --> 29:50.500
I was just trying to...

29:52.967 --> 29:54.466
I was acting.

29:54.467 --> 29:56.032
Playacting.

29:56.033 --> 29:58.100
Like you're always doing.

30:03.467 --> 30:04.933
Look at yourself.

30:10.967 --> 30:12.433
Give me that.

30:14.300 --> 30:15.632
Ow!

30:15.633 --> 30:17.632
What have you done to your...

30:17.633 --> 30:20.232
Tina, what have you
put on your hair?

30:20.233 --> 30:23.232
What have you done
to this damn hair?

30:23.233 --> 30:24.766
I'm sorry. I'm sorry!

30:24.767 --> 30:26.766
It was just setting lotion.

30:26.767 --> 30:28.266
Oh, mommie, ow!

30:28.267 --> 30:29.433
Ohhh!

30:31.967 --> 30:33.932
What are you doing?

30:33.933 --> 30:35.966
Oh, mommie, don't!

30:35.967 --> 30:38.466
Don't you tell me
what I'm doing.

30:38.467 --> 30:40.432
Oh, no. Mommie, I look awful!

30:40.433 --> 30:41.666
I know you look awful.

30:41.667 --> 30:43.166
You be quiet!

30:43.167 --> 30:45.132
You're always rummaging
through my drawers.

30:45.133 --> 30:48.666
Trying to find a way to
make people look at you?

30:48.667 --> 30:50.432
Why are you always looking
at yourself in the mirror?

30:50.433 --> 30:51.932
Why are you? Tell me!

30:51.933 --> 30:53.466
You sit still now.

30:53.467 --> 30:56.432
I'm going to teach you,
you're vain, spoiled.

30:56.433 --> 30:58.966
Mommie, I can't go
to school like this.

30:58.967 --> 31:01.833
I'd rather you go bald to school
than looking like a tramp.

31:02.867 --> 31:05.166
No, mommie, please!

31:05.167 --> 31:07.266
Why?

31:07.267 --> 31:11.266
Mommie, I can't go
to school like this.

31:11.267 --> 31:12.899
Mommie, please!

31:12.900 --> 31:14.399
You spoiled it.

31:14.400 --> 31:18.166
You spoiled it just
like I spoiled you!

31:18.167 --> 31:19.599
Please!

31:19.600 --> 31:21.266
Mom!

31:21.267 --> 31:24.267
Aah, aah, aah.

31:34.533 --> 31:35.867
Joan Crawford!

31:41.167 --> 31:44.467
Joan Crawford! Joan Crawford!

31:45.500 --> 31:46.867
Take it easy.

32:15.333 --> 32:16.832
Good evening, miss Crawford.

32:16.833 --> 32:17.799
Good evening.

32:17.800 --> 32:18.799
Welcome.

32:18.800 --> 32:20.300
Your booth is ready.

32:39.800 --> 32:41.200
Excuse me.

32:44.500 --> 32:47.599
Well, I'm glad to see they
finally let go of you.

32:47.600 --> 32:50.032
I was about to send out
a rescue party.

32:50.033 --> 32:52.466
Hello, I.B. What a
pleasant surprise.

32:52.467 --> 32:54.966
Joanie, I want you to meet a few
financial friends from New York.

32:54.967 --> 32:56.499
They're bankers.

32:56.500 --> 32:57.966
Mr. Lubin, Mr. Dodd.

32:57.967 --> 32:58.999
It's a pleasure.

32:59.000 --> 33:00.466
Mr. Lubin, Mr. Dodd.

33:00.467 --> 33:02.432
Please, sit down. Join us.

33:02.433 --> 33:03.932
My daughter Helen

33:03.933 --> 33:06.399
would love to have your
signature, miss Crawford.

33:06.400 --> 33:07.666
Of course.

33:07.667 --> 33:10.266
You see, she didn't ask
for I.B. Mayer's signature.

33:10.267 --> 33:13.499
That's because she's not
as smart as her father.

33:13.500 --> 33:14.866
Ha ha ha!

33:14.867 --> 33:17.999
She doesn't know
that you are the king.

33:18.000 --> 33:19.999
Thank you.

33:20.000 --> 33:21.566
Where are you going?

33:21.567 --> 33:23.099
Come join us.
We're having dinner.

33:23.100 --> 33:25.166
You're one of the reasons
bankers love Metro.

33:25.167 --> 33:27.332
Thank you, I.B.,
but our table is ready.

33:27.333 --> 33:28.500
I insist.

33:36.367 --> 33:37.966
You're aces, joanie.

33:37.967 --> 33:39.999
I'm glad you think that, I.B.,

33:40.000 --> 33:42.066
because aces beat kings.

33:42.067 --> 33:44.132
Ha ha ha!

33:44.133 --> 33:45.666
Not in Hollywood, dear.

33:45.667 --> 33:48.732
I'm sure you'll find
the interest arrangements

33:48.733 --> 33:49.966
quite agreeable.

33:49.967 --> 33:51.999
That'll be just fine, I.B.

33:52.000 --> 33:54.433
We'll all meet
in New York, hmm?

33:58.700 --> 34:01.199
Hauling me over
to Mayer's table

34:01.200 --> 34:03.399
like some picked-up floozy!

34:03.400 --> 34:04.899
Or one of those starlets,

34:04.900 --> 34:07.932
out to give the big shots
a nice night in town.

34:07.933 --> 34:11.032
Is that what you think of me?

34:11.033 --> 34:13.032
How many drinks is that?

34:13.033 --> 34:14.166
Oh.

34:14.167 --> 34:17.299
When you were a kid,
that made you look sexy.

34:17.300 --> 34:19.467
Now it just makes you
look drunk.

34:22.933 --> 34:25.498
I may as well have
"property of mgm"

34:25.500 --> 34:27.632
tattooed on my backside!

34:29.567 --> 34:33.431
And damn it,
perino's is <i> my </i> place.

34:33.433 --> 34:36.632
Nobody wanted my signature,
so I just walked in.

34:36.632 --> 34:39.199
You expect me
to ignore my fans?

34:39.199 --> 34:41.766
They're life and
death to me, baby.

34:41.766 --> 34:44.299
They're the ones
who really make me.

34:44.300 --> 34:46.599
I expect you to walk in with me

34:46.600 --> 34:48.399
and sit down
at your table with me!

34:48.400 --> 34:50.431
Then Mayer would have
to bring his bankers over,

34:50.433 --> 34:52.065
introduce them, and get
your autograph and leave!

34:52.067 --> 34:53.766
That's what you should've done!

34:53.766 --> 34:55.299
Maybe that's what
I would've done

34:55.300 --> 34:58.432
if you'd been nice enough
to stay out there with me,

34:58.433 --> 35:00.432
help me through the crowd
and into the restaurant

35:00.433 --> 35:01.532
like a gentleman!

35:01.533 --> 35:03.099
Why are you screaming?

35:03.100 --> 35:04.933
Because I'm damn mad!

35:06.933 --> 35:09.166
Damn it, Greg.

35:09.167 --> 35:12.132
How can you put Mayer over me?

35:12.133 --> 35:15.700
You know that son of a bitch is
trying to destroy my career.

35:17.500 --> 35:19.799
If your career's in trouble,

35:19.800 --> 35:21.766
it has nothing to do with him.

35:21.767 --> 35:24.266
Then what is it?

35:24.267 --> 35:28.232
You were always the shop girl
who fought her way to the top,

35:28.233 --> 35:29.499
made a great success.

35:29.500 --> 35:31.932
Well, you're not
a little shop girl anymore.

35:31.933 --> 35:34.932
Now that's the truth,
to face and deal with...

35:34.933 --> 35:36.932
If you want to survive.

35:36.933 --> 35:40.133
The truth is,
you're getting old.

35:42.567 --> 35:43.732
Yeah.

35:43.733 --> 35:47.699
You're nothing but a
rotten, crooked lawyer,

35:47.700 --> 35:52.800
supplying the grease that makes
this shitty movie business work.

35:54.467 --> 35:56.466
You think your life's
a mystery.

35:56.467 --> 35:59.866
There isn't a dirty cover-up
in this entire business

35:59.867 --> 36:01.399
that I don't know about,

36:01.400 --> 36:03.899
and your hand
is in every one of them!

36:03.900 --> 36:05.766
You reek of it!

36:05.767 --> 36:06.899
Damn you!

36:06.900 --> 36:08.766
Are you crazy?

36:08.767 --> 36:11.799
No person talks
to me like that.

36:11.800 --> 36:14.199
No one anywhere! Are you crazy?
Are you?

36:14.200 --> 36:15.400
Tell me!

36:16.533 --> 36:17.732
Tell me!

36:17.733 --> 36:19.567
I'm crazy.

36:29.267 --> 36:31.899
I didn't mean that, Greg.

36:31.900 --> 36:33.967
I didn't mean it.

36:39.700 --> 36:41.432
Get up.

36:41.433 --> 36:43.900
There's no camera in here.

36:58.933 --> 37:00.300
Greg.

37:03.967 --> 37:05.666
Where you going?

37:05.667 --> 37:09.199
Where I belong...

37:09.200 --> 37:11.199
out of here.

37:11.200 --> 37:13.067
You belong here.

37:28.500 --> 37:30.600
I'm waiting for you.

37:32.033 --> 37:33.867
Good night, Joan.

37:39.033 --> 37:42.032
Please don't leave,
because if you do,

37:42.033 --> 37:44.532
you'll never
come back in again,

37:44.533 --> 37:47.867
no matter what you
say or ask or do.

37:50.167 --> 37:52.666
I'll always...

37:52.667 --> 37:55.000
Wish you well, Joan.

37:56.533 --> 37:59.433
And I'll only
speak well of you.

38:03.933 --> 38:05.433
Please don't go.

38:08.467 --> 38:10.433
Don't leave me here alone.

38:13.300 --> 38:14.533
Please?

38:16.767 --> 38:19.732
If you're acting,
you're wasting your time.

38:19.733 --> 38:22.699
If you're not,
you're wasting mine.

38:22.700 --> 38:25.433
I'm not acting.

38:27.467 --> 38:28.867
I'm not acting.

38:29.900 --> 38:30.933
Good night.

38:32.267 --> 38:33.267
Good luck.

38:37.800 --> 38:38.867
Good-bye.

39:10.400 --> 39:11.732
Good morning.

39:11.733 --> 39:14.399
Good morning, dearest heart.

39:14.400 --> 39:16.366
Hello, darling.

39:16.367 --> 39:17.866
Ahh!

39:17.867 --> 39:20.299
Hello, Christopher, my angel.

39:20.300 --> 39:21.799
Look. How are you?

39:21.800 --> 39:23.266
Did you sleep well?

39:23.267 --> 39:24.432
Did you?

39:24.433 --> 39:26.399
Mmm.

39:26.400 --> 39:27.966
Run along downstairs.

39:27.967 --> 39:29.599
Get your breakfast,

39:29.600 --> 39:31.132
and <i> don't </i> be late for school.

39:31.133 --> 39:32.366
I won't.

39:32.367 --> 39:33.399
Look after Christopher.

39:33.400 --> 39:34.633
Whoa, o.K.

39:41.000 --> 39:43.667
If she doesn't like you...

39:45.267 --> 39:47.733
She can make you disappear.

40:04.367 --> 40:05.932
Ginny, are we running short?

40:05.933 --> 40:08.132
Shall I send
for more photographs?

40:08.133 --> 40:09.399
Oh, no, miss Crawford.

40:09.400 --> 40:11.899
The studio just
sent over a new batch.

40:11.900 --> 40:13.099
We've got plenty.

40:13.100 --> 40:15.099
Good. You're all
so gracious to help,

40:15.100 --> 40:17.366
and you're doing
a wonderful job.

40:17.367 --> 40:18.366
And you.

40:18.367 --> 40:20.199
Let's see.

40:20.200 --> 40:22.699
I'll roll it to you this way.

40:22.700 --> 40:24.199
Go get it, Christopher.

40:24.200 --> 40:25.766
Come on! Get it, Christopher.

40:25.767 --> 40:28.232
Here I come! Get it!

40:28.233 --> 40:30.899
Christina! Christopher!

40:30.900 --> 40:33.166
Damn it!

40:33.167 --> 40:34.399
Carol Ann!

40:34.400 --> 40:37.932
I have asked you to keep
the children quiet today!

40:37.933 --> 40:42.032
Now, for Christ's sake,
get them out of the garden!

40:42.033 --> 40:43.399
I'm sorry, Joan.

40:43.400 --> 40:46.032
Have Tina bring me up
my coffee.

40:46.033 --> 40:47.333
All right, Joan.

40:54.200 --> 40:57.366
I'm sorry, mommie.

40:57.367 --> 41:00.332
I tried to be quiet.

41:00.333 --> 41:01.832
We were playing.

41:01.833 --> 41:03.300
And you forgot.

41:06.800 --> 41:09.399
You promised last night.

41:09.400 --> 41:10.900
You promised.

41:13.500 --> 41:15.632
Look, I told you

41:15.633 --> 41:18.199
how important
today is to mommie.

41:18.200 --> 41:19.799
I explained why,

41:19.800 --> 41:21.300
didn't I, Tina?

41:22.367 --> 41:24.467
I'm sorry, mommie.

41:27.633 --> 41:30.700
Go to your room
until I come for you.

41:39.067 --> 41:43.899
You're very, very bad
to wake mommie up like that.

41:43.900 --> 41:45.466
<i>Very </i> naughty.

41:45.467 --> 41:46.999
I told you,

41:47.000 --> 41:50.666
mommie has to be
beautiful today.

41:50.667 --> 41:55.832
This afternoon,
she has to see Mr. Mayer.

41:55.833 --> 41:58.466
Today is so important.

41:58.467 --> 42:01.699
You are selfish
and thoughtless.

42:01.700 --> 42:05.532
You must learn to think
about other people.

42:05.533 --> 42:08.333
You're bad,
bad spoiled children.

42:27.733 --> 42:29.266
My babies.

42:29.267 --> 42:32.866
Someone stole both my babies.

42:32.867 --> 42:35.367
That's good, darling.

42:36.800 --> 42:42.133
They were thoughtless,
selfish, spoiled children.

42:44.000 --> 42:48.267
Now they won't wake you up
when you need <i> your </i> rest.

43:14.067 --> 43:15.566
Good morning, miss Crawford.

43:15.567 --> 43:17.566
Good morning, Ellen.
What a lovely blouse.

43:17.567 --> 43:19.133
Thank you very much.

43:21.200 --> 43:22.199
Come.

43:22.200 --> 43:24.300
Thank you, Connie.

43:25.567 --> 43:26.700
Joan.

43:29.167 --> 43:32.066
Look at you. Look at you.

43:32.067 --> 43:34.832
18 years in the business,

43:34.833 --> 43:37.833
and who could hold
a candle to you?

43:40.200 --> 43:41.866
You're always so kind.

43:41.867 --> 43:46.166
Kind? Of all my picture
family, who turned out best?

43:46.167 --> 43:48.166
Who never let me down?

43:48.167 --> 43:49.332
Joan Crawford.

43:49.333 --> 43:51.066
To all the new kids coming up,

43:51.067 --> 43:52.532
she's like a diamond.

43:52.533 --> 43:54.300
Class.

43:55.533 --> 43:58.066
Have I ever lied to you
in your whole career,

43:58.067 --> 44:00.599
or given you one piece
of bad advice?

44:00.600 --> 44:01.900
Never.

44:03.600 --> 44:04.767
Never.

44:06.600 --> 44:09.632
Your treatment of me
has been divine.

44:09.633 --> 44:13.366
Joan, my Joan, you're in a
position to do me a favor.

44:13.367 --> 44:16.599
It will be as big a favor
for you as it is for me.

44:16.600 --> 44:19.132
You don't have to ask.

44:19.133 --> 44:21.166
You only have to tell me.

44:21.167 --> 44:23.900
Good. I want you
to leave Metro.

44:27.433 --> 44:28.667
Leave Metro?

44:35.367 --> 44:37.866
Leave Metro?

44:37.867 --> 44:41.299
Your pictures, one after
another, are losing money.

44:41.300 --> 44:44.666
Theater owners voted you
box-office poison.

44:44.667 --> 44:47.632
Even so, for years
I've paid no attention.

44:47.633 --> 44:49.232
You know me, Joan.

44:49.233 --> 44:51.266
I don't give up so easily.

44:51.267 --> 44:54.266
We'll pay you off
on your contract.

44:54.267 --> 44:57.999
But you can't afford to make three
or four more losers for us.

44:58.000 --> 45:00.732
It's the scripts, I.B.

45:00.733 --> 45:02.732
Bad pictures, bad directors...

45:02.733 --> 45:04.399
bad with you, good with others.

45:04.400 --> 45:07.066
No. Listen to me, I.B.
I have been begging you!

45:07.067 --> 45:09.066
Begging you for a good script.

45:09.067 --> 45:12.066
Now, you've always given me
my share of bad movies

45:12.067 --> 45:14.532
because you knew
I'd make them work.

45:14.533 --> 45:16.766
Well, I can't keep
doing it, I.B.

45:16.767 --> 45:19.566
Listen with your ears
and not with your pride.

45:19.567 --> 45:22.567
With me, feeling is more
important than money.

45:23.867 --> 45:26.032
You're a great star.

45:26.033 --> 45:27.533
You're Hollywood royalty.

45:28.867 --> 45:31.132
But styles change.

45:31.133 --> 45:33.166
You'll leave.

45:33.167 --> 45:35.132
We have creative differences.

45:35.133 --> 45:38.499
We don't want to fight
or argue with each other

45:38.500 --> 45:40.566
because we love each other.

45:40.567 --> 45:43.799
Every studio will think
they're smarter than I.B.

45:43.800 --> 45:46.099
They'll try to finesse me.

45:46.100 --> 45:49.300
You'll be offered one, two,
three, four, five films.

45:50.433 --> 45:53.266
You may even get a hit.

45:53.267 --> 45:55.733
Will you be sorry then?

45:57.367 --> 45:58.933
I'm sorry now.

46:00.500 --> 46:03.999
But here there's no
confidence, there's no hope.

46:04.000 --> 46:05.966
It's time for a change.

46:05.967 --> 46:09.966
New faces, new voices,
a breath of fresh air.

46:09.967 --> 46:11.100
Who knows?

46:13.700 --> 46:16.433
Don't do this to yourself.

46:22.000 --> 46:23.567
I'll, uh...

46:26.000 --> 46:30.499
I'll have my maid and studio
people clear out my bungalow.

46:30.500 --> 46:33.732
I have a lot of years
to collect.

46:33.733 --> 46:35.399
It's done, Joan.

46:35.400 --> 46:36.532
They've packed your things.

46:36.533 --> 46:38.167
They're loading your car.

46:40.500 --> 46:44.532
You mean everybody...
Already knows?

46:44.533 --> 46:48.333
That we parted friends
because we didn't agree.

47:08.900 --> 47:11.433
Will you walk me to my car?

47:17.900 --> 47:19.967
Hollywood royalty.

47:34.867 --> 47:36.932
Aah!

47:36.933 --> 47:39.933
I'm... Hollywood royalty!

47:45.500 --> 47:48.899
Everyone already knows...
box-office poison.

47:48.900 --> 47:51.399
Box-office poison!

47:51.400 --> 47:54.432
Class. You're... Class.

47:54.433 --> 47:56.066
You're class!

47:56.067 --> 47:57.766
Box-office poison!

47:57.767 --> 47:58.899
Wake up. Wake up.

47:58.900 --> 48:00.899
Come on, children. Wake up.

48:00.900 --> 48:02.299
Wha-what's happening?

48:02.300 --> 48:04.099
Your mother wants you
downstairs in the rose garden.

48:04.100 --> 48:05.766
Come on. Hurry up.

48:05.767 --> 48:07.866
You, too, Christopher. Come on.

48:07.867 --> 48:08.866
Come on. Come along.

48:08.867 --> 48:10.732
Your mother wants you
right away.

48:10.733 --> 48:13.432
18 years in the business!

48:13.433 --> 48:14.633
Parted friends!

48:16.667 --> 48:19.366
Creative differences!

48:19.367 --> 48:22.399
Oh, good. I want
some help here.

48:22.400 --> 48:25.199
I want all of these branches
cleared out of here now!

48:25.200 --> 48:28.299
Carol Ann and Christopher, start
clearing away all these branches.

48:28.300 --> 48:29.366
Start gathering them up.

48:29.367 --> 48:32.500
Go and get the wheelbarrow
and the rake.

48:48.500 --> 48:49.800
Tina!

48:51.833 --> 48:53.500
Bring me the ax!

49:58.367 --> 50:01.066
Carol Ann, get some more emotion
into the scene, some expression.

50:01.067 --> 50:02.799
I can't keep the emotion up

50:02.800 --> 50:05.566
if you don't come in
right away.

50:05.567 --> 50:10.933
Let's, uh... after the uniform...
downtown... restaurants.

50:13.267 --> 50:16.199
My mother, a common waitress.

50:16.200 --> 50:18.199
I took the best job
I could find

50:18.200 --> 50:19.366
so that you and your
sister could eat

50:19.367 --> 50:20.366
and have a place to sleep

50:20.367 --> 50:21.799
and some clothes on your backs.

50:21.800 --> 50:24.699
Aren't the pies enough?
Do you have to degrade us?

50:24.700 --> 50:26.232
Veda, don't say that.

50:26.233 --> 50:27.799
I'm really not surprised.

50:27.800 --> 50:30.299
You've never spoken of your
people, who you came from,

50:30.300 --> 50:31.832
so perhaps it's natural.

50:31.833 --> 50:34.167
Maybe that's why father left!

50:36.933 --> 50:38.933
I'm sorry I did that.

50:42.567 --> 50:45.200
I'd have rather
cut off my hand.

50:50.367 --> 50:52.966
Your mother's been
practicing and practicing.

50:52.967 --> 50:56.366
You know how perfect
she always wants to be.

50:56.367 --> 51:00.766
Well, this time
she <i> must </i> be perfect.

51:00.767 --> 51:02.332
Do you understand?

51:02.333 --> 51:05.933
She wants everything
to be perfect.

51:07.367 --> 51:10.500
This time it's even
more important.

51:14.367 --> 51:18.100
They're making your mother
take a screen test.

51:19.400 --> 51:21.699
Do you know what that is?

51:21.700 --> 51:24.499
When they're not sure
they want you?

51:24.500 --> 51:28.066
And you know how shameful
that is for her.

51:28.067 --> 51:30.499
She wants this film.

51:30.500 --> 51:32.166
She knows she's right.

51:32.167 --> 51:35.832
She <i> is </i> this character,
Mildred Pierce.

51:35.833 --> 51:37.832
We have to help her.

51:37.833 --> 51:39.866
We will, won't we?

51:39.867 --> 51:41.232
I will.

51:41.233 --> 51:43.500
I will.

51:47.767 --> 51:50.432
Christina?

51:50.433 --> 51:52.800
You haven't touched your lunch.

51:56.367 --> 51:58.099
It's raw.

51:58.100 --> 51:59.732
It's rare,

51:59.733 --> 52:01.699
not raw.

52:01.700 --> 52:05.699
But it's got all this red
juice when I push on it.

52:05.700 --> 52:08.099
Then don't push on it.

52:08.100 --> 52:11.132
Darling, rare meat
is good for you.

52:11.133 --> 52:12.800
The doctor said so.

52:25.533 --> 52:27.999
Christina...

52:28.000 --> 52:33.732
Meat loses its vitamins
if it's overcooked.

52:33.733 --> 52:36.199
I've had my vitamins
this morning.

52:36.200 --> 52:37.700
Pills.

52:39.300 --> 52:43.100
She negotiates everything,
like a goddamn Hollywood agent.

52:46.500 --> 52:47.567
Christina...

52:50.133 --> 52:52.000
Eat your lunch.

52:54.800 --> 52:57.799
You are not getting up
from this table

52:57.800 --> 53:00.267
until you have
finished that meat.

53:38.067 --> 53:41.066
You may get up
from the table now.

53:41.067 --> 53:43.700
Just a minute, young lady!

53:46.567 --> 53:50.032
Pick up that plate,
take it into the kitchen,

53:50.033 --> 53:52.433
and put it
into the refrigerator.

53:56.700 --> 53:59.499
Now, do you know
I'm going out this evening?

53:59.500 --> 54:01.499
You will have dinner
in your room alone.

54:01.500 --> 54:03.332
You will eat everything
on that plate.

54:03.333 --> 54:04.967
Do you understand?

55:35.933 --> 55:38.432
You may drink
your glass of milk

55:38.433 --> 55:42.067
and then you may be excused
from the table, Christina.

55:48.933 --> 55:50.133
Tina...

55:51.433 --> 55:53.666
Empty that plate...

55:53.667 --> 55:55.633
Into the trash can.

56:11.367 --> 56:14.933
Why must everything
be a contest?

56:18.067 --> 56:20.033
<i>The envelope, please.</i>

56:22.467 --> 56:25.399
<i>And the winner is...</i>
<i>Ray milland!</i>

56:25.400 --> 56:27.200
<i>For </i> the lost weekend.

56:28.233 --> 56:30.432
God! I hate this night!

56:30.433 --> 56:33.333
It turns every year
into a crisis.

56:38.300 --> 56:40.032
I wish I did have pneumonia.

56:40.033 --> 56:43.232
I wish I was raging mad
over the flu.

56:43.233 --> 56:47.199
And a fever so I wouldn't
have even listened!

56:47.200 --> 56:50.666
<i>Now for the best female
performance in a leading role,</i>

56:50.667 --> 56:53.532
<i>the nominees are...</i>
<i>Ingrid bergman</i>

56:53.533 --> 56:56.132

<i>and Jennifer Jones for</i>

57:11.467 --> 57:13.833
You're going to win, I know it.

57:14.933 --> 57:16.066
<i>May I have the envelope...</i>

57:16.067 --> 57:17.899
The picture <i> is </i> a hit.

57:17.900 --> 57:19.732
Shh!

57:19.733 --> 57:21.632
<i>And the winner is...</i>

57:21.633 --> 57:23.899
<i>Joan Crawford for</i>

57:23.900 --> 57:25.467
Oh! Oh!

57:26.567 --> 57:28.432
<i>Accepting for Joan Crawford</i>

57:28.433 --> 57:31.767
<i>is the director of </i> Mildred
Pierce, <i>Michael curtiz.</i>

57:32.800 --> 57:34.399
Oh, mommie, you won!

57:34.400 --> 57:36.267
Oh, it's wonderful!

57:37.800 --> 57:38.866
Oh... Joan!

57:38.867 --> 57:40.432
Listen to them.

57:40.433 --> 57:43.299
They're so happy for you!

57:43.300 --> 57:45.133
Oh, I knew it!

58:07.867 --> 58:10.399
I would rather be here with you

58:10.400 --> 58:12.832
than anywhere else
in the world!

58:12.833 --> 58:15.066
Ohh! Ohh! Ohh!

58:15.067 --> 58:18.132
You... All of you here

58:18.133 --> 58:19.832
and everywhere...

58:19.833 --> 58:21.900
Gave me this award tonight.

58:23.200 --> 58:28.066
And I accept it from you
and only you.

58:28.067 --> 58:30.533
Ahh! That's beautiful!

58:33.533 --> 58:36.266
I love all of you!

58:36.267 --> 58:38.632
Miss Crawford, we love you!

58:38.633 --> 58:41.299
Now please forgive me.

58:41.300 --> 58:43.000
Good night.

58:53.500 --> 58:58.367
Radio: ...All this glamour, this has
surely got to be everyone's dream.

01:00:53.567 --> 01:01:00.299
No... Wire... Hangers!

01:01:00.300 --> 01:01:03.166
What's wire hangers
doing in this closet

01:01:03.167 --> 01:01:07.132
when I told you
no wire hangers?

01:01:07.133 --> 01:01:08.600
Ever!

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:13.199
I work and work
until I'm half dead,

01:01:13.200 --> 01:01:17.199
and I hear people saying,
"she's getting old."

01:01:17.200 --> 01:01:20.599
And what do I get?

01:01:20.600 --> 01:01:23.299
A daughter!

01:01:23.300 --> 01:01:24.599
Who cares as much

01:01:24.600 --> 01:01:27.799
about the beautiful
dresses I give her

01:01:27.800 --> 01:01:32.066
as she cares about me!

01:01:32.067 --> 01:01:36.733
What's wire hangers doing
in this closet?

01:01:38.100 --> 01:01:40.232
Answer me!

01:01:40.233 --> 01:01:43.932
I buy you beautiful dresses,

01:01:43.933 --> 01:01:47.399
and you treat them like
they were some dishrag!

01:01:47.400 --> 01:01:53.566
You'd put a $300 dress
on a wire hanger?

01:01:53.567 --> 01:01:57.299
We'll see how many
you've got hidden over here!

01:01:57.300 --> 01:01:59.066
We'll see!

01:01:59.067 --> 01:02:02.366
We'll see...
get out of that bed!

01:02:02.367 --> 01:02:04.866
All of this is going out! Out!

01:02:04.867 --> 01:02:05.866
Mommie, please!

01:02:05.867 --> 01:02:06.866
Out! Out!

01:02:06.867 --> 01:02:07.832
No! Mommie!

01:02:07.833 --> 01:02:09.500
Out!

01:02:11.133 --> 01:02:13.466
We're going to see
how many wire hangers

01:02:13.467 --> 01:02:16.099
you've got in your closet!

01:02:16.100 --> 01:02:17.400
Wire...

01:02:19.400 --> 01:02:20.366
Wire...

01:02:20.367 --> 01:02:22.332
Wire hangers...

01:02:22.333 --> 01:02:23.999
why?

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.833
Why? Christina,
get out of that bed!

01:02:28.500 --> 01:02:29.732
Get out of that bed!

01:02:29.733 --> 01:02:31.466
Oh!

01:02:31.467 --> 01:02:35.166
You live in the most beautiful
house in brentwood...

01:02:35.167 --> 01:02:36.499
Mommie!

01:02:36.500 --> 01:02:37.832
And you don't care

01:02:37.833 --> 01:02:40.499
if your clothes are stretched
out from wire hangers!

01:02:40.500 --> 01:02:43.366
Please! Mommie, don't!

01:02:43.367 --> 01:02:47.632
Mommie... Don't!

01:02:47.633 --> 01:02:51.466
And your room looks like
a 2-dollar refurnished room

01:02:51.467 --> 01:02:55.066
in some 2-bit back-street town

01:02:55.067 --> 01:02:56.100
in Oklahoma!

01:03:00.800 --> 01:03:03.100
Now, get up! Get up!
Clean up this mess!

01:03:23.333 --> 01:03:26.900
Did you scrub
the bathroom floor today?

01:03:29.633 --> 01:03:30.600
Did you!?

01:03:32.133 --> 01:03:33.900
Yes, mommie.

01:03:36.567 --> 01:03:37.833
Yes, mommie what?

01:03:42.067 --> 01:03:44.000
Yes, mommie dearest.

01:03:46.933 --> 01:03:51.766
When I told you
to call me that...

01:03:51.767 --> 01:03:54.667
I wanted you to mean it.

01:03:56.633 --> 01:03:58.033
Come here.

01:04:02.267 --> 01:04:05.066
Look at this floor.

01:04:05.067 --> 01:04:06.799
Do you call that clean?

01:04:06.800 --> 01:04:08.266
Do you?

01:04:08.267 --> 01:04:10.433
Miss Jenkins said it was clean.

01:04:13.533 --> 01:04:16.033
Miss Jenkins said it was clean?

01:04:17.800 --> 01:04:20.266
Do you think it's clean?

01:04:20.267 --> 01:04:22.067
Do <i> you </i> think it's clean?

01:04:23.300 --> 01:04:25.166
Look at that. Do you?

01:04:25.167 --> 01:04:27.600
Yes, I do.

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:34.499
Get on the floor.

01:04:34.500 --> 01:04:36.966
We're going
to clean this floor.

01:04:36.967 --> 01:04:38.566
You and me together.

01:04:38.567 --> 01:04:40.999
Go.

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.032
Go. Scrub hard.

01:04:43.033 --> 01:04:44.032
Scrub.

01:04:44.033 --> 01:04:45.066
Mommie...

01:04:45.067 --> 01:04:46.067
scrub, Christina.

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:49.532
This floor's already clean.

01:04:49.533 --> 01:04:52.832
It's not... this floor
is not clean!

01:04:52.833 --> 01:04:54.299
Look at it!

01:04:54.300 --> 01:04:56.199
This floor is not clean!

01:04:56.200 --> 01:04:57.899
Mommie, no!

01:04:57.900 --> 01:05:00.166
This floor is not clean!

01:05:00.167 --> 01:05:01.499
Nothing is clean!

01:05:01.500 --> 01:05:04.899
This whole place is a mess!

01:05:04.900 --> 01:05:05.866
Mommie!

01:05:05.867 --> 01:05:09.367
It's... A... Mess...

01:05:12.767 --> 01:05:18.033
Mommie! I... I don't
understand!

01:05:51.367 --> 01:05:54.433
Clean up this mess!

01:05:58.300 --> 01:05:59.500
But...

01:06:01.667 --> 01:06:02.867
How?

01:06:05.567 --> 01:06:08.133
You figure it out.

01:06:34.600 --> 01:06:37.032
I'll help you clean it up.

01:06:37.033 --> 01:06:40.299
No. Go back.

01:06:40.300 --> 01:06:42.566
Strap yourself in.

01:06:42.567 --> 01:06:45.533
She'll kill me
if she found out.

01:06:56.400 --> 01:06:59.267
Jesus... Christ!

01:07:05.033 --> 01:07:09.199
No report on Christmas
would be complete

01:07:09.200 --> 01:07:10.699
without a description

01:07:10.700 --> 01:07:14.299
of how one Hollywood family
spends this holiday.

01:07:14.300 --> 01:07:18.966
So now, let us all hop
on our imaginary sleigh

01:07:18.967 --> 01:07:21.499
and whisk away to the home

01:07:21.500 --> 01:07:23.699
of one of America's
foremost actresses...

01:07:23.700 --> 01:07:25.499
miss Joan Crawford.

01:07:25.500 --> 01:07:29.499
We're so very happy to
have you with us, George.

01:07:29.500 --> 01:07:31.499
This is my daughter Christina.

01:07:31.500 --> 01:07:32.966
Hello, everybody.

01:07:32.967 --> 01:07:35.466
And my son Christopher.

01:07:35.467 --> 01:07:37.499
Hello.

01:07:37.500 --> 01:07:40.599
All of America knows
of your generosity

01:07:40.600 --> 01:07:43.032
in adopting these
two homeless children.

01:07:43.033 --> 01:07:45.032
And might I say
to all of our listeners

01:07:45.033 --> 01:07:48.332
they're beautifully behaved.

01:07:48.333 --> 01:07:49.866
Thank you, George.

01:07:49.867 --> 01:07:52.299
I feel that discipline
mixed with love

01:07:52.300 --> 01:07:55.266
is such a good recipe.

01:07:55.267 --> 01:07:58.866
Christina, do you and your
brother get lots of presents

01:07:58.867 --> 01:08:00.399
at christmastime?

01:08:00.400 --> 01:08:01.799
Yes, we do.

01:08:01.800 --> 01:08:05.132
Mother's fans send us
so many beautiful things,

01:08:05.133 --> 01:08:07.932
but we like to share them
with other boys and girls,

01:08:07.933 --> 01:08:10.932
who aren't so fortunate.

01:08:10.933 --> 01:08:12.566
Miss Crawford...

01:08:12.567 --> 01:08:14.832
Could you tell us
what will happen

01:08:14.833 --> 01:08:16.832
after we leave you
this evening?

01:08:16.832 --> 01:08:18.832
Well, the children
and I will probably

01:08:18.832 --> 01:08:20.832
sit and watch the
Christmas tree lights,

01:08:20.832 --> 01:08:22.332
and then later we'll welcome

01:08:22.332 --> 01:08:24.166
some of the children's friends

01:08:24.167 --> 01:08:26.066
to help us sing
Christmas Carols.

01:08:26.067 --> 01:08:29.299
And surely you'll
finish up by reading

01:08:29.300 --> 01:08:30.799
<i>'twas the night</i>
<i>before Christmas.</i>

01:08:30.800 --> 01:08:34.532
No Christmas Eve would be
complete without that.

01:08:34.533 --> 01:08:37.066
Well, as a Christmas present
to our listeners,

01:08:37.067 --> 01:08:40.700
would all of you like
to say the last two lines?

01:08:43.167 --> 01:08:45.166
And I heard him exclaim

01:08:45.167 --> 01:08:47.765
as he drove out of sight,

01:08:47.767 --> 01:08:50.299
"merry Christmas to all,

01:08:50.300 --> 01:08:53.166
and to all a good night."

01:08:53.167 --> 01:08:56.099
And good night to you, miss
Crawford, and thank you,

01:08:56.100 --> 01:08:59.499
for allowing all of us to
share your Christmas Eve.

01:08:59.500 --> 01:09:01.099
And thank you, George,

01:09:01.100 --> 01:09:02.799
and merry Christmas to you

01:09:02.800 --> 01:09:06.631
and to all your listeners.

01:09:06.633 --> 01:09:10.399
Mommie's not quite
ready yet, Mr. Gilbert.

01:09:10.399 --> 01:09:12.566
Will it be scotch
with ice tonight?

01:09:12.567 --> 01:09:15.067
Please. Take it easy
with the scotch, honey.

01:09:33.067 --> 01:09:35.600
Easy. Easy on the scotch,
Christina.

01:09:37.300 --> 01:09:39.232
Mr. Gilbert...

01:09:39.233 --> 01:09:42.667
I fix all my uncles'
drinks this way.

01:09:45.067 --> 01:09:47.800
I...Am not your uncle.

01:10:19.900 --> 01:10:21.299
Mommie?

01:10:21.300 --> 01:10:23.532
Mr. Gilbert is here.

01:10:23.533 --> 01:10:25.899
Very good, darling.

01:10:25.900 --> 01:10:26.899
Hello, Ted.

01:10:26.900 --> 01:10:27.933
Joan.

01:10:29.767 --> 01:10:32.399
You know by now you can
call him uncle Ted.

01:10:32.400 --> 01:10:34.132
Yes, mommie dearest.

01:10:34.133 --> 01:10:36.067
Uncle Ted.

01:10:37.967 --> 01:10:39.567
See you later, Tina darling.

01:10:47.800 --> 01:10:49.332
It's not good.

01:10:49.333 --> 01:10:50.799
You didn't like it?

01:10:50.800 --> 01:10:53.200
No. It's not good.

01:10:55.400 --> 01:10:57.566
We have to find
something wonderful.

01:10:57.567 --> 01:10:59.800
I think we have everything
here there is to find.

01:11:42.933 --> 01:11:44.567
We've got company.

01:11:52.200 --> 01:11:53.167
Tina?

01:11:54.700 --> 01:11:57.367
I made you a fresh one,
mommie dearest.

01:12:01.767 --> 01:12:03.667
Thank you, Tina darling.

01:12:18.433 --> 01:12:21.633
That's quite an
extraordinary young lady.

01:12:26.733 --> 01:12:28.432
Whatever I did...

01:12:28.433 --> 01:12:31.232
I won't do it again.

01:12:31.233 --> 01:12:32.732
I promise.

01:12:32.733 --> 01:12:34.499
I can be better.

01:12:34.500 --> 01:12:36.999
You'll see. The time
will fly by.

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:38.967
You can call me
anytime collect.

01:13:09.433 --> 01:13:10.932
Oh.

01:13:10.933 --> 01:13:14.432
Mrs. Chadwick, how kind
of you to greet us.

01:13:14.433 --> 01:13:15.832
This is Christina.

01:13:15.833 --> 01:13:18.066
I know you'll be
happy here, Christina.

01:13:18.067 --> 01:13:19.666
I won't.

01:13:19.667 --> 01:13:22.167
Please don't make me stay.

01:13:25.300 --> 01:13:27.299
I don't want to leave home.

01:13:27.300 --> 01:13:30.299
You're not, darling.
Now listen to me.

01:13:30.300 --> 01:13:32.399
You're not leaving home.

01:13:32.400 --> 01:13:35.066
You'll be home some
weekends and holidays.

01:13:35.067 --> 01:13:37.032
What will Mrs. Chadwick think?

01:13:37.033 --> 01:13:39.532
I'm sure everything
will be fine

01:13:39.533 --> 01:13:41.233
once you settle in.

01:13:42.433 --> 01:13:45.400
Now, I'll call you
later, all right?

01:13:58.867 --> 01:14:02.267
I understand just
how you feel, Christina.

01:14:05.500 --> 01:14:07.933
I understand.

01:14:10.433 --> 01:14:12.467
Understand.

01:14:14.667 --> 01:14:17.633
The first word I ever heard...

01:14:19.533 --> 01:14:21.499
Out of any of you

01:14:21.500 --> 01:14:23.666
was that word...

01:14:23.667 --> 01:14:26.599
"Understand."

01:14:26.600 --> 01:14:31.332
There will be time enough
to understand when I'm old,

01:14:31.333 --> 01:14:35.066
if I ever am old.

01:14:35.067 --> 01:14:37.967
Oh, but not now.

01:14:44.067 --> 01:14:45.532
That was great, Christina.

01:14:45.533 --> 01:14:46.600
Thank you.

01:14:48.267 --> 01:14:50.832
Well, what play was that from?

01:14:50.833 --> 01:14:52.132
It's <i> antigone.</i>

01:14:52.133 --> 01:14:54.666
It's a Greek myth written
by a French playwright.

01:14:54.667 --> 01:14:56.599
Well, can I have your autograph

01:14:56.600 --> 01:14:58.699
when you're a big movie star?

01:14:58.700 --> 01:15:01.232
Darling, if I'm not too booked.

01:15:01.233 --> 01:15:03.266
Not too booked,
miss movie star?

01:15:03.267 --> 01:15:05.366
What is this, not too booked?

01:15:05.367 --> 01:15:06.899
Stop it, Tony.

01:15:06.900 --> 01:15:09.067
Yes, stop it.

01:15:22.867 --> 01:15:24.933
Christina, do sit up properly.

01:15:27.867 --> 01:15:29.932
Isn't this fun...

01:15:29.933 --> 01:15:31.466
Us having a date

01:15:31.467 --> 01:15:34.300
on your weekend
home from school?

01:15:42.800 --> 01:15:44.366
Charming hat, Christina.

01:15:44.367 --> 01:15:46.832
Oh, why thank you, Tommy.

01:15:46.833 --> 01:15:49.532
I picked it out myself.

01:15:49.533 --> 01:15:51.367
Don't flirt, Christina.

01:15:54.467 --> 01:15:58.966
Tommy, we'll have the New
York steak for two, rare...

01:15:58.967 --> 01:16:00.867
And two limestone salads.

01:16:04.967 --> 01:16:05.999
Thank you, miss Crawford.

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:07.200
Thank you, Tommy.

01:16:12.467 --> 01:16:14.199
Tina...

01:16:14.200 --> 01:16:17.299
Flirting can be...

01:16:17.300 --> 01:16:18.767
Taken the wrong way.

01:16:20.267 --> 01:16:21.767
Do you understand?

01:16:23.033 --> 01:16:25.832
Mmm.

01:16:25.833 --> 01:16:27.267
I want to show you something.

01:16:30.233 --> 01:16:32.699
I got all as...

01:16:32.700 --> 01:16:33.700
One "b."

01:16:36.700 --> 01:16:39.199
I'm very proud
of you, Christina.

01:16:39.200 --> 01:16:40.232
Thank you.

01:16:40.233 --> 01:16:41.367
Very proud.

01:16:45.967 --> 01:16:49.633
Now, what about your
Christmas card list?

01:16:51.467 --> 01:16:53.966
Christmas cards?

01:16:53.967 --> 01:16:56.966
I've been studying for exams.

01:16:56.967 --> 01:17:00.399
I'll get the cards
out on time, o.K.?

01:17:00.400 --> 01:17:03.399
You know, Tina,
being away at school

01:17:03.400 --> 01:17:05.566
has made you more rebellious.

01:17:05.567 --> 01:17:08.266
I am not a baby anymore.

01:17:08.267 --> 01:17:11.900
Maybe you'd be
better off at home.

01:17:15.300 --> 01:17:16.533
Sorry.

01:17:18.300 --> 01:17:21.332
I have had a lot of schoolwork.

01:17:21.333 --> 01:17:24.299
Times are tough.

01:17:24.300 --> 01:17:27.299
Still, I treat you
to a lovely evening...

01:17:27.300 --> 01:17:28.832
What do I get?

01:17:28.833 --> 01:17:30.600
Smart-aleck back talk.

01:17:32.533 --> 01:17:35.232
I'm sorry, mommie dearest.

01:17:35.233 --> 01:17:38.232
It's all right.

01:17:38.233 --> 01:17:41.199
I've had to let Helga go.

01:17:41.200 --> 01:17:43.333
I'll need your help
at home this weekend.

01:17:45.900 --> 01:17:48.367
Well, let's have
a lovely evening.

01:17:49.833 --> 01:17:51.300
Shall we?

01:18:11.200 --> 01:18:13.266
God, you scared me.

01:18:13.267 --> 01:18:14.567
Sorry, Tina.

01:18:18.233 --> 01:18:20.233
How are you doing?

01:18:22.767 --> 01:18:24.266
About finished?

01:18:24.267 --> 01:18:26.033
Almost.

01:18:27.233 --> 01:18:29.666
Sit down, Tina.

01:18:29.667 --> 01:18:32.633
I want to talk to you
about something.

01:18:37.667 --> 01:18:39.267
What did I do?

01:18:43.600 --> 01:18:45.000
It's not you.

01:18:54.667 --> 01:18:56.133
Tina, darling, I...

01:18:58.633 --> 01:19:00.699
I'm having some...

01:19:00.700 --> 01:19:02.633
Financial difficulties.

01:19:05.167 --> 01:19:09.132
I just spoke to Mrs. Chadwick.

01:19:09.133 --> 01:19:11.666
She's agreed to let you go

01:19:11.667 --> 01:19:13.633
on a work scholarship program.

01:19:23.667 --> 01:19:26.166
That's all right.

01:19:26.167 --> 01:19:27.867
We'll manage.

01:19:42.367 --> 01:19:44.867
You know, I was on a work
scholarship program.

01:19:48.733 --> 01:19:51.067
Made my way through school
scrubbing floors.

01:19:52.100 --> 01:19:54.066
Mostly...

01:19:54.067 --> 01:19:55.267
Work.

01:20:03.833 --> 01:20:05.200
What is it?

01:20:08.300 --> 01:20:10.400
There is something else.

01:20:14.300 --> 01:20:17.133
I lost my contract at Warner's.

01:20:27.800 --> 01:20:28.832
I...

01:20:28.833 --> 01:20:31.800
I don't feel I have anybody.

01:20:35.500 --> 01:20:37.067
No contract.

01:20:39.133 --> 01:20:40.633
No studio.

01:20:42.767 --> 01:20:44.000
No money.

01:20:47.100 --> 01:20:48.099
Oh, Tina.

01:20:48.100 --> 01:20:51.067
I don't know what
I'm going to do.

01:20:54.600 --> 01:20:57.366
I don't know what
I'm going to do.

01:20:57.367 --> 01:20:59.833
It'll be o.K.

01:21:04.333 --> 01:21:06.100
We'll manage.

01:21:15.900 --> 01:21:18.033
I'm scared, Tina.

01:21:22.367 --> 01:21:24.033
I'm scared.

01:21:27.767 --> 01:21:29.799
After all those years,

01:21:29.800 --> 01:21:32.933
I never thought
it could happen to me.

01:21:38.333 --> 01:21:41.300
I don't know what
I'm going to do.

01:21:44.833 --> 01:21:47.800
I don't know what
I'm going to do.

01:21:52.800 --> 01:21:54.300
Don't worry.

01:21:56.567 --> 01:21:58.332
Oh, mommie...

01:21:58.333 --> 01:21:59.933
I love you.

01:22:12.467 --> 01:22:13.600
Mommie.

01:22:15.633 --> 01:22:16.767
Mommie?

01:22:18.300 --> 01:22:21.767
I came up to say good night
to you.

01:22:33.800 --> 01:22:35.500
Mommie?

01:22:38.633 --> 01:22:40.300
Mommie.

01:22:41.867 --> 01:22:43.400
Mommie.

01:22:44.233 --> 01:22:45.667
Mommie.

01:22:47.633 --> 01:22:49.999
Carol Ann.

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:51.333
Carol Ann!

01:22:52.867 --> 01:22:53.832
Something's happened.

01:22:53.833 --> 01:22:55.366
What's the matter?

01:22:55.367 --> 01:22:56.833
I don't know.

01:22:59.333 --> 01:23:00.799
I came in,

01:23:00.800 --> 01:23:03.267
and I found her like this.

01:23:04.833 --> 01:23:07.099
I think she needs an ambulance.

01:23:07.100 --> 01:23:09.666
She doesn't need an ambulance.

01:23:09.667 --> 01:23:11.967
She's drunk.

01:23:14.400 --> 01:23:16.866
Come on. Let's put her to bed.

01:23:16.867 --> 01:23:18.100
Joan.

01:23:21.167 --> 01:23:23.499
When did she buy all of these?

01:23:23.500 --> 01:23:26.466
Two days ago. They were
delivered this afternoon.

01:23:26.467 --> 01:23:28.199
Get up. Get up.

01:23:28.200 --> 01:23:31.266
She told me we were broke.

01:23:31.267 --> 01:23:32.999
Come on. Help me.

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.133
Stop it. Help me. Come on.

01:23:37.033 --> 01:23:39.032
Come on, Joan. Come on.

01:23:39.033 --> 01:23:40.532
Give me the pillow.

01:23:40.533 --> 01:23:43.532
Come on. Give me the pillow.

01:23:43.533 --> 01:23:46.166
Give me the pillow. Good.

01:23:46.167 --> 01:23:47.132
Good.

01:23:47.133 --> 01:23:49.066
You're a lousy substitute...

01:23:49.067 --> 01:23:52.532
For someone who really cares.

01:23:52.533 --> 01:23:53.533
Huh?

01:23:59.600 --> 01:24:01.900
Christina, darling.

01:24:06.633 --> 01:24:08.966
Christina, darling.

01:24:08.967 --> 01:24:10.167
Come on, Joan.

01:24:11.867 --> 01:24:14.132
Joan.

01:24:14.133 --> 01:24:15.932
Christina, darling.

01:24:15.933 --> 01:24:18.732
Sorry it has to be like this.

01:24:18.733 --> 01:24:21.099
For you... For her...

01:24:21.100 --> 01:24:24.032
Christina, darling.

01:24:24.033 --> 01:24:25.766
Come on, Joan.

01:24:25.767 --> 01:24:26.732
Joan.

01:24:26.733 --> 01:24:29.099
It all comes out in the wash.

01:24:29.100 --> 01:24:30.699
You come on now.

01:24:30.700 --> 01:24:34.467
Hold on to me... Hold on.

01:24:43.567 --> 01:24:44.566
Hi, Tony.

01:24:44.567 --> 01:24:45.766
Hi.

01:24:45.767 --> 01:24:48.199
You handle that
horse pretty well

01:24:48.200 --> 01:24:49.732
for a lousy rider.

01:24:49.733 --> 01:24:51.232
Yeah, he's a great horse.

01:24:51.233 --> 01:24:52.732
Want to ride him?

01:24:52.733 --> 01:24:53.732
When?

01:24:53.733 --> 01:24:55.232
When you want to?

01:24:55.233 --> 01:24:56.966
Well, I work all day.

01:24:56.967 --> 01:24:58.832
How about tonight?

01:24:58.833 --> 01:25:01.133
I'll go with you.

01:25:02.233 --> 01:25:03.732
What about vera?

01:25:03.733 --> 01:25:05.900
She's just a friend.

01:25:09.600 --> 01:25:10.766
8:30?

01:25:10.767 --> 01:25:12.733
Right here?

01:25:35.500 --> 01:25:37.999
That was my first kiss.

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:39.832
I'll bet.

01:25:39.833 --> 01:25:41.067
Well, kinda.

01:26:12.367 --> 01:26:13.399
Swell.

01:26:13.400 --> 01:26:14.899
This is really swell.

01:26:14.900 --> 01:26:16.066
Vera.

01:26:16.067 --> 01:26:17.699
I'm going to tell.

01:26:17.700 --> 01:26:20.866
Oh, I am. I am going to tell.

01:26:20.867 --> 01:26:22.899
How? How could this happen?

01:26:22.900 --> 01:26:24.766
How could you humiliate me
this way?

01:26:24.767 --> 01:26:26.766
I am ashamed to be your mother!

01:26:26.767 --> 01:26:29.232
And you, how could you
let this happen?

01:26:29.233 --> 01:26:31.299
Both students have
been put on probation

01:26:31.300 --> 01:26:33.732
and will have no
privileges for a month.

01:26:33.733 --> 01:26:34.766
Probation?

01:26:34.767 --> 01:26:36.299
This is appalling.

01:26:36.300 --> 01:26:37.799
I have devoted myself

01:26:37.800 --> 01:26:39.766
to making Christina
a proper young lady.

01:26:39.767 --> 01:26:41.832
That boy should be expelled.

01:26:41.833 --> 01:26:43.066
Now, miss Crawford,

01:26:43.067 --> 01:26:45.399
when this sort of thing
has happened before...

01:26:45.400 --> 01:26:46.399
before?

01:26:46.400 --> 01:26:49.032
Is this an institution
of learning

01:26:49.033 --> 01:26:50.766
or a teenage brothel?

01:26:50.767 --> 01:26:52.899
Chadwick has an
impeccable reputation,

01:26:52.900 --> 01:26:55.866
and when students
break the rules,

01:26:55.867 --> 01:26:57.899
we curtail their freedom.

01:26:57.900 --> 01:27:00.832
Well, we are leaving here
right now.

01:27:00.833 --> 01:27:02.866
Obviously she
cannot be controlled

01:27:02.867 --> 01:27:04.432
in this environment.

01:27:04.433 --> 01:27:06.032
Nothing really happened
between your daughter

01:27:06.033 --> 01:27:08.232
and the young man.
It was innocent.

01:27:08.233 --> 01:27:09.699
No thanks to you.

01:27:09.700 --> 01:27:12.332
I think you're overreacting,
miss Crawford.

01:27:12.333 --> 01:27:15.200
And I think you're
underreacting, Mrs. Chadwick.

01:27:19.400 --> 01:27:21.199
My compliments to your school

01:27:21.200 --> 01:27:22.732
on its impeccable reputation.

01:27:22.733 --> 01:27:24.000
Christina, come on.

01:27:38.833 --> 01:27:40.967
There's a liquor store
to the right.

01:27:44.100 --> 01:27:45.732
I should have known

01:27:45.733 --> 01:27:49.033
you'd know where to find
the boys <i> and </i> the booze.

01:28:00.733 --> 01:28:02.732
All right.

01:28:02.733 --> 01:28:04.199
Tina, look at me.

01:28:04.200 --> 01:28:06.732
Barbara Bennett is
here from New York

01:28:06.733 --> 01:28:09.732
doing a cover story
on me for <i> redbook.</i>

01:28:09.733 --> 01:28:11.200
Tina, look at me...

01:28:12.233 --> 01:28:13.900
When I'm talking to you.

01:28:17.400 --> 01:28:20.799
This is very important to me.

01:28:20.800 --> 01:28:23.067
I don't want any
trouble from you.

01:28:37.400 --> 01:28:38.866
I'm back.

01:28:38.867 --> 01:28:41.099
You're going to love this.

01:28:41.100 --> 01:28:43.866
"Movie star manages
to have it all...

01:28:43.867 --> 01:28:46.767
career, home, and family."

01:28:48.200 --> 01:28:49.800
Let me see that.

01:28:52.233 --> 01:28:55.032
My god, Christina.

01:28:55.033 --> 01:28:57.666
It can't be.

01:28:57.667 --> 01:29:00.866
The last time I saw you,
you were 4.

01:29:00.867 --> 01:29:02.666
How are you, miss Bennett?

01:29:02.667 --> 01:29:04.166
God, call me Barbara.

01:29:04.167 --> 01:29:08.866
Teaching you some fancy
manners at chadwick.

01:29:08.867 --> 01:29:11.867
That's not all
they've been teaching her.

01:29:13.167 --> 01:29:15.332
Well, how do you like school?

01:29:15.333 --> 01:29:17.499
Very much, thank you.

01:29:17.500 --> 01:29:19.332
She got expelled.

01:29:19.333 --> 01:29:20.933
That's a lie.

01:29:26.500 --> 01:29:27.967
Excuse me, Barbara.

01:29:31.833 --> 01:29:34.200
Tina, I want to talk to you.

01:29:35.967 --> 01:29:38.000
In the other room.

01:29:54.233 --> 01:29:56.199
Why do you
deliberately defy me?

01:29:56.200 --> 01:29:58.232
Why did you tell her
I got expelled?

01:29:58.233 --> 01:30:00.699
Because you did get expelled!

01:30:00.700 --> 01:30:03.533
That is a lie.

01:30:13.167 --> 01:30:14.799
You love it, don't you?

01:30:14.800 --> 01:30:18.099
You love to make me hit you!

01:30:18.100 --> 01:30:19.366
Joan!

01:30:19.367 --> 01:30:21.066
Barbara, please.

01:30:21.067 --> 01:30:22.732
Please, Barbara.

01:30:22.733 --> 01:30:24.166
Leave us alone, Barbara.

01:30:24.167 --> 01:30:26.532
If you need anything,
ask Carol Ann.

01:30:26.533 --> 01:30:28.332
Oh...

01:30:28.333 --> 01:30:29.832
This is wonderful.

01:30:29.833 --> 01:30:32.167
This is wonderful!

01:30:33.333 --> 01:30:34.832
You...

01:30:34.833 --> 01:30:37.332
You deliberately embarrass me

01:30:37.333 --> 01:30:39.332
in front of a reporter!

01:30:39.333 --> 01:30:40.399
A reporter.

01:30:40.400 --> 01:30:43.866
I told you how important
this is to me.

01:30:43.867 --> 01:30:45.466
I told you!

01:30:45.467 --> 01:30:48.866
Why did you adopt me?

01:30:48.867 --> 01:30:50.632
What?

01:30:50.633 --> 01:30:53.867
Why did you adopt me?

01:30:59.033 --> 01:31:01.000
Because I wanted a child.

01:31:04.833 --> 01:31:07.566
Because I wanted
someone to love.

01:31:07.567 --> 01:31:11.833
Don't you act for me.

01:31:13.900 --> 01:31:16.400
I want to know.

01:31:18.500 --> 01:31:21.767
Why did you adopt me?!

01:31:23.833 --> 01:31:26.932
Maybe I did it for a
little extra publicity.

01:31:26.933 --> 01:31:29.266
Tina...

01:31:29.267 --> 01:31:31.233
That's not true.

01:31:33.467 --> 01:31:37.099
You know that's not true.

01:31:37.100 --> 01:31:40.233
Maybe just a little true.

01:31:47.033 --> 01:31:49.533
I don't know
what to do with you.

01:31:51.033 --> 01:31:53.899
I don't know
what to do with you.

01:31:53.900 --> 01:31:55.967
Why not?

01:32:02.433 --> 01:32:05.400
I don't ask much
from you, girl.

01:32:08.233 --> 01:32:12.999
Why can't you
give me the respect

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:15.233
that I'm entitled to?

01:32:17.400 --> 01:32:20.099
Why can't you treat me

01:32:20.100 --> 01:32:22.132
like I would be treated

01:32:22.133 --> 01:32:25.766
by any stranger on the street?

01:32:25.767 --> 01:32:28.532
Because I am not

01:32:28.533 --> 01:32:31.367
one of your fans!

01:32:33.867 --> 01:32:35.599
Aah!

01:32:35.600 --> 01:32:36.799
Mommie!

01:32:36.800 --> 01:32:38.232
You never loved me!

01:32:38.233 --> 01:32:40.166
Mommie!

01:32:40.167 --> 01:32:41.166
Aah!

01:32:41.167 --> 01:32:43.199
Taken! Taken! Taken!

01:32:43.200 --> 01:32:44.666
You hated me!

01:32:44.667 --> 01:32:46.932
You never loved me!

01:32:46.933 --> 01:32:50.132
Never! Never!

01:32:50.133 --> 01:32:51.867
You've always taken and taken!

01:32:53.633 --> 01:32:56.966
You never wanted
to be my daughter!

01:32:56.967 --> 01:33:00.332
You've always taken everything!

01:33:00.333 --> 01:33:02.932
Everything you ever need!

01:33:02.933 --> 01:33:05.166
And you give nothing back!

01:33:05.167 --> 01:33:06.166
Why?

01:33:06.167 --> 01:33:08.166
Love me!

01:33:08.167 --> 01:33:11.599
Aah!

01:33:11.600 --> 01:33:13.832
Joan, stop! You're
going to kill her!

01:33:13.833 --> 01:33:16.867
Aah!

01:33:21.267 --> 01:33:22.467
Get out!

01:33:24.033 --> 01:33:26.600
Get out...

01:33:32.800 --> 01:33:33.866
Mommie.

01:33:33.867 --> 01:33:36.567
Dear Christina...

01:33:38.367 --> 01:33:41.366
God has brought you
to our convent school

01:33:41.367 --> 01:33:43.366
so that you could see

01:33:43.367 --> 01:33:45.366
the error of your ways.

01:33:45.367 --> 01:33:47.366
Your mother has told us

01:33:47.367 --> 01:33:49.199
how difficult you've been,

01:33:49.200 --> 01:33:52.299
both at home and
at your former school.

01:33:52.300 --> 01:33:56.299
She has requested the
strictest discipline for you.

01:33:56.300 --> 01:33:58.799
There will be no privileges.

01:33:58.800 --> 01:34:02.232
You're not to leave the school.

01:34:02.233 --> 01:34:06.699
There will be no telephone
calls in or out.

01:34:06.700 --> 01:34:08.499
No visitors.

01:34:08.500 --> 01:34:10.599
No mail.

01:34:10.600 --> 01:34:14.366
You have sinned in the past,

01:34:14.367 --> 01:34:17.766
transgressed against
the holy commandments,

01:34:17.767 --> 01:34:22.066
but you shall find
forgiveness here

01:34:22.067 --> 01:34:24.499
and be cleansed.

01:34:24.500 --> 01:34:27.532
Let us pray together
for your repentance.

01:34:27.533 --> 01:34:30.299
The good lord will grace you

01:34:30.300 --> 01:34:32.267
with his comfort and kindness.

01:34:54.967 --> 01:34:56.432
To Joan and Alfred,

01:34:56.433 --> 01:34:58.466
a long and happy marriage.

01:34:58.467 --> 01:34:59.899
Hear, hear!

01:34:59.900 --> 01:35:01.366
Hear, hear!

01:35:01.367 --> 01:35:02.832
Hold it. Hold it.

01:35:02.833 --> 01:35:04.467
Look this way, please.

01:35:05.933 --> 01:35:06.933
Thank you.

01:35:08.400 --> 01:35:10.399
Alfred, darling, I'm so happy.

01:35:10.400 --> 01:35:11.399
Speech!

01:35:11.400 --> 01:35:12.766
Speech!

01:35:12.767 --> 01:35:13.766
Oh...

01:35:13.767 --> 01:35:14.766
Speech!

01:35:14.767 --> 01:35:17.766
Uh, thank you all
for being here

01:35:17.767 --> 01:35:19.733
on such short notice.

01:35:21.767 --> 01:35:24.766
If this marriage comes
as a surprise

01:35:24.767 --> 01:35:26.266
to some of you,

01:35:26.267 --> 01:35:27.766
just think how I felt

01:35:27.767 --> 01:35:28.933
when Joan said yes.

01:35:31.033 --> 01:35:33.099
You know, a few minutes ago

01:35:33.100 --> 01:35:35.099
a reporter asked me
what I thought

01:35:35.100 --> 01:35:36.599
and how I would describe

01:35:36.600 --> 01:35:39.099
the marriage between
the soft drink king

01:35:39.100 --> 01:35:40.566
and the queen of Hollywood.

01:35:40.567 --> 01:35:44.933
I told him I thought it
was a hell of a match.

01:35:47.133 --> 01:35:48.766
That's my pally.

01:35:48.767 --> 01:35:51.099
Oh, pally. That's
what he calls you

01:35:51.100 --> 01:35:53.099
when he can't
remember your name.

01:35:53.100 --> 01:35:56.066
Oh, don't you let her kid you.

01:35:56.067 --> 01:35:57.566
I remember her name.

01:35:57.567 --> 01:35:59.099
It's Mrs. Alfred Steele.

01:35:59.100 --> 01:36:00.066
Right, pally?

01:36:00.067 --> 01:36:01.533
Right.

01:36:16.233 --> 01:36:17.733
Thank you, sister...

01:36:19.600 --> 01:36:22.566
For being so good to me.

01:36:22.567 --> 01:36:25.899
These years have been...

01:36:25.900 --> 01:36:27.499
Very hard.

01:36:27.500 --> 01:36:30.099
Good-bye, dear child.

01:36:30.100 --> 01:36:32.367
God be with you.

01:36:35.367 --> 01:36:37.167
Thank you.

01:36:49.200 --> 01:36:51.166
No, thanks. I can manage it.

01:36:51.167 --> 01:36:52.700
I'm o.K.

01:37:31.800 --> 01:37:32.767
Mommie?

01:37:55.867 --> 01:37:57.166
Ho ho ho. Well...

01:37:57.167 --> 01:37:59.866
Oh, I miss you, too, darling.

01:37:59.867 --> 01:38:01.032
Yes.

01:38:01.033 --> 01:38:03.599
You get to New York so often.

01:38:03.600 --> 01:38:04.832
You know?

01:38:04.833 --> 01:38:06.832
We'll see each other there.

01:38:06.833 --> 01:38:09.499
Yes, I've put the house
up for sale.

01:38:09.500 --> 01:38:11.499
Alfred travels so much,
and, um,

01:38:11.500 --> 01:38:14.100
well, corporate headquarters
are in New York.

01:38:16.133 --> 01:38:18.566
Darling, my daughter's here.

01:38:18.567 --> 01:38:21.099
I'll talk to you
before we leave.

01:38:21.100 --> 01:38:23.367
All right. Love to you, too.

01:38:25.700 --> 01:38:26.967
Hello, mother.

01:38:30.633 --> 01:38:32.599
Christina.

01:38:32.600 --> 01:38:35.966
I want you to meet my husband.

01:38:35.967 --> 01:38:37.732
What do I call him?

01:38:37.733 --> 01:38:40.466
What would you call
anyone who's your father?

01:38:40.467 --> 01:38:41.932
Go introduce yourself.

01:38:41.933 --> 01:38:43.400
Go on.

01:39:02.433 --> 01:39:04.199
Hello, daddy.

01:39:04.200 --> 01:39:06.000
I'm Christina.

01:39:20.033 --> 01:39:21.866
Hello, Arthur.

01:39:21.867 --> 01:39:22.932
Well...

01:39:22.933 --> 01:39:24.966
I don't know what to do.

01:39:24.967 --> 01:39:28.267
That bitch of a bearing
wall is blocking my view.

01:39:38.567 --> 01:39:41.832
I'll tell you what to do.

01:39:41.833 --> 01:39:45.566
Tear down that bitch
of a bearing wall

01:39:45.567 --> 01:39:50.567
and put a window
where it ought to be!

01:40:01.967 --> 01:40:03.767
Tina, what do you think?

01:40:05.167 --> 01:40:07.400
It'll be great.

01:40:09.200 --> 01:40:10.499
Darling, coffee?

01:40:10.500 --> 01:40:12.200
Yeah, sure.

01:40:15.567 --> 01:40:17.067
Tina, darling, coffee?

01:40:21.667 --> 01:40:23.899
So you're acting?

01:40:23.900 --> 01:40:25.367
Yeah.

01:40:26.367 --> 01:40:28.199
Where?

01:40:28.200 --> 01:40:30.099
Well, mostly in stock.

01:40:30.100 --> 01:40:32.633
I think I may be pretty good.

01:40:34.067 --> 01:40:35.800
Good luck, darling.

01:40:41.167 --> 01:40:42.999
I have been working nights

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:46.599
so I can go on interviews
during the day.

01:40:46.600 --> 01:40:49.299
See, the thing is, I...

01:40:49.300 --> 01:40:53.599
Well, I was wondering if, uh, you
could lend me a little money,

01:40:53.600 --> 01:40:56.167
you know, to get by this month.

01:40:58.333 --> 01:41:00.066
Not a cent.

01:41:00.067 --> 01:41:02.232
Joan, come on.
A little something.

01:41:02.233 --> 01:41:05.766
Doing things on your own...

01:41:05.767 --> 01:41:07.799
Is best.

01:41:07.800 --> 01:41:10.433
Don't you agree, Tina?

01:41:12.033 --> 01:41:13.767
Sure.

01:41:15.433 --> 01:41:17.467
I'll get by.

01:41:26.367 --> 01:41:27.400
Between us.

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:34.299
Now, the sofa will
have to be delivered.

01:41:34.300 --> 01:41:35.466
This is wonderful.

01:41:35.467 --> 01:41:36.499
And this chair...

01:41:36.500 --> 01:41:37.832
That is my favorite.

01:41:37.833 --> 01:41:39.199
It's my favorite, too.

01:41:39.200 --> 01:41:40.532
All on the terrace.

01:41:40.533 --> 01:41:43.166
Would you excuse us
for a minute, please?

01:41:43.167 --> 01:41:44.466
Oh. Yes.

01:41:44.467 --> 01:41:45.766
Al, look at this.

01:41:45.767 --> 01:41:47.999
It's perfect
except for the colors.

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:49.666
They're too strong.

01:41:49.667 --> 01:41:53.199
And I want you
to look at these.

01:41:53.200 --> 01:41:56.499
I, uh, hate to bring
this up, but, um...

01:41:56.500 --> 01:42:00.066
We're going to have to cut
back on our spending.

01:42:00.067 --> 01:42:02.599
What are you talking about?

01:42:02.600 --> 01:42:04.932
Al, I'm doing all this for you.

01:42:04.933 --> 01:42:07.466
I'm turning this apartment
into <i> your </i> showplace.

01:42:07.467 --> 01:42:09.866
You're doing a marvelous job,

01:42:09.867 --> 01:42:11.866
but we've got to economize.

01:42:11.867 --> 01:42:13.299
Most of our expenses,

01:42:13.300 --> 01:42:14.732
including this apartment,

01:42:14.733 --> 01:42:16.199
are for <i> your </i> company.

01:42:16.200 --> 01:42:19.199
We have to look great
for Pepsi-cola!

01:42:19.200 --> 01:42:21.232
I want us to look great,

01:42:21.233 --> 01:42:23.932
and I want us to live well,
but there's a limit.

01:42:23.933 --> 01:42:26.432
We're going into debt.

01:42:26.433 --> 01:42:28.999
Al, you're a great businessman.

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:30.599
You and your company

01:42:30.600 --> 01:42:35.066
have found yourselves a movie
star to sell your soda pop.

01:42:35.067 --> 01:42:38.032
Well, you got to pay the price.

01:42:38.033 --> 01:42:39.799
Be reasonable, pally.

01:42:39.800 --> 01:42:42.266
You've got everything
you need for this place.

01:42:42.267 --> 01:42:45.166
Just look at this joint.

01:42:45.167 --> 01:42:49.032
You genius
of the soft drink world!

01:42:49.033 --> 01:42:52.066
Get the goddamned
company to pay the bill!

01:42:52.067 --> 01:42:54.432
You've got to understand!
It's a public company!

01:42:54.433 --> 01:42:55.766
This isn't Hollywood

01:42:55.767 --> 01:42:58.699
where someone takes care of
things with a phone call!

01:42:58.700 --> 01:43:00.632
This is the real world!

01:43:00.633 --> 01:43:04.966
The real world expects us
to live in a certain way.

01:43:04.967 --> 01:43:07.400
Yeah, well, that way
is breaking my back.

01:43:16.500 --> 01:43:18.467
We'll find a solution.

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:22.167
You love a challenge.

01:43:25.667 --> 01:43:27.467
O.K., pally.

01:43:29.167 --> 01:43:31.032
Miss Crawford, the condolences

01:43:31.033 --> 01:43:34.299
of every person at
Pepsi-cola are with you.

01:43:34.300 --> 01:43:36.932
Al Steele helped
make this company.

01:43:36.933 --> 01:43:39.199
And you were right by his side,

01:43:39.200 --> 01:43:41.166
sharing the burdens and the joy.

01:43:41.167 --> 01:43:45.366
And we want to give you ample
time to repay the debt.

01:43:45.367 --> 01:43:46.499
Plenty of time.

01:43:46.500 --> 01:43:47.632
Of course,

01:43:47.633 --> 01:43:50.466
we'll have to take the
5th Avenue apartment.

01:43:50.467 --> 01:43:54.032
You probably wouldn't want
to stay there alone, anyway.

01:43:54.033 --> 01:43:55.799
What debt?

01:43:55.800 --> 01:43:58.866
I've got 100,000 shares
of stock.

01:43:58.867 --> 01:44:01.566
Your husband had to
borrow against the stock

01:44:01.567 --> 01:44:04.266
to pay for the construction
on your apartment.

01:44:04.267 --> 01:44:07.266
And we loaned him a
considerable sum, in addition,

01:44:07.267 --> 01:44:10.767
to meet expenses his
salary didn't cover.

01:44:12.733 --> 01:44:16.166
You think you're
very clever, don't you,

01:44:16.167 --> 01:44:19.232
trying to sweep
the poor little widow

01:44:19.233 --> 01:44:21.599
under the carpet?

01:44:21.600 --> 01:44:23.399
Well...

01:44:23.400 --> 01:44:25.567
Think again.

01:44:27.900 --> 01:44:30.099
I'm on the board of directors

01:44:30.100 --> 01:44:32.566
of this lousy company.

01:44:32.567 --> 01:44:34.632
Well, we assumed that
with your husband gone,

01:44:34.633 --> 01:44:37.499
you would no longer
want to be on the board.

01:44:37.500 --> 01:44:41.166
Al and I helped build Pepsi
to what it is today.

01:44:41.167 --> 01:44:44.132
I intend to stay with it.

01:44:44.133 --> 01:44:47.899
We appreciate your
devotion and contribution,

01:44:47.900 --> 01:44:49.832
miss Crawford,

01:44:49.833 --> 01:44:52.732
but we have retired you

01:44:52.733 --> 01:44:55.099
from the board of directors.

01:44:55.100 --> 01:44:57.532
You drove al Steele
to his grave,

01:44:57.533 --> 01:45:00.299
and now you're trying
to stab me in the back?

01:45:00.300 --> 01:45:01.732
Forget it!

01:45:01.733 --> 01:45:04.832
I've fought worse monsters than
you for years in Hollywood.

01:45:04.833 --> 01:45:07.832
I know how to win the hard way!

01:45:07.833 --> 01:45:10.332
Miss Crawford, we don't
want any hard feelings.

01:45:10.333 --> 01:45:12.732
You don't know
what hard feelings are

01:45:12.733 --> 01:45:16.366
until I come out publicly
against your product,

01:45:16.367 --> 01:45:19.099
and you'll see
how much you sell.

01:45:19.100 --> 01:45:20.732
Please, miss Crawford,

01:45:20.733 --> 01:45:22.732
it's hardly necessary
to make threats

01:45:22.733 --> 01:45:24.299
you surely don't mean.

01:45:24.300 --> 01:45:26.800
Don't fuck with me, fellas!

01:45:28.100 --> 01:45:30.866
This ain't my first time
at the rodeo.

01:45:30.867 --> 01:45:35.466
You forget the press I delivered
to Pepsi was <i> my </i> power.

01:45:35.467 --> 01:45:38.166
I can use it any way I want.

01:45:38.167 --> 01:45:39.433
The sword...

01:45:41.167 --> 01:45:43.167
Cuts both ways.

01:45:45.500 --> 01:45:46.833
Ahem.

01:45:48.633 --> 01:45:50.832
The board has failed to realize

01:45:50.833 --> 01:45:53.566
the extent of your
interest in the company...

01:45:53.567 --> 01:45:55.267
apart from al's position.

01:45:57.933 --> 01:46:00.433
We, um...

01:46:02.933 --> 01:46:04.999
Misjudged.

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:08.933
We shall be... Pleased
to have you stay on.

01:46:14.333 --> 01:46:16.067
Thank you, gentlemen.

01:46:17.667 --> 01:46:20.967
Now let's get to work.

01:46:54.400 --> 01:46:55.400
Coming.

01:47:05.533 --> 01:47:06.633
Mommie.

01:47:08.267 --> 01:47:09.566
Oh, Tina, darling.

01:47:09.567 --> 01:47:12.232
I wish I would've known
you were coming.

01:47:12.233 --> 01:47:13.532
Well...

01:47:13.533 --> 01:47:16.199
I just happened to be
in the neighborhood.

01:47:16.200 --> 01:47:18.500
I would've straightened
up a little bit.

01:47:19.800 --> 01:47:22.033
Looks quite neat to me.

01:47:24.433 --> 01:47:27.000
Oh, Jesus Christ.

01:47:29.800 --> 01:47:32.267
I'd forgotten what it was like.

01:47:37.600 --> 01:47:38.767
Sit down.

01:47:44.800 --> 01:47:46.799
How are you, Tina?

01:47:46.800 --> 01:47:48.266
Been making rounds.

01:47:48.267 --> 01:47:50.232
A lot of rejections.

01:47:50.233 --> 01:47:52.432
But I'm up for a part.

01:47:52.433 --> 01:47:53.432
Good.

01:47:53.433 --> 01:47:54.799
It's a soap opera.

01:47:54.800 --> 01:47:57.899
Well, it's very
good experience.

01:47:57.900 --> 01:48:00.366
Have you got a glass, darling?

01:48:00.367 --> 01:48:01.799
Oh, yeah.

01:48:01.800 --> 01:48:04.099
Hey, you know where
I got this from?

01:48:04.100 --> 01:48:05.099
Uh-uh.

01:48:05.100 --> 01:48:07.132
Batista himself. Ha ha.

01:48:07.133 --> 01:48:08.232
Yeah?

01:48:08.233 --> 01:48:11.333
When I opened a plant
outside havana.

01:48:12.567 --> 01:48:14.932
It's all they gave you?

01:48:14.933 --> 01:48:15.933
That's it.

01:48:20.400 --> 01:48:21.832
Cheap bastards.

01:48:21.833 --> 01:48:23.533
Ha ha ha ha.

01:48:25.400 --> 01:48:28.300
Do you miss all that?

01:48:29.600 --> 01:48:31.067
I miss al more.

01:48:38.100 --> 01:48:39.067
So...

01:48:41.033 --> 01:48:42.567
How are the guys?

01:48:46.100 --> 01:48:47.599
Guys are guys.

01:48:47.600 --> 01:48:49.233
It... it hasn't changed.

01:48:51.500 --> 01:48:53.632
I brought you...

01:48:53.633 --> 01:48:54.667
A gift.

01:49:05.433 --> 01:49:06.933
Thank you, mommie.

01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:19.433
Oh...

01:49:24.033 --> 01:49:26.133
They were the first present
that al ever gave me.

01:49:28.067 --> 01:49:30.800
They're beautiful.

01:49:31.900 --> 01:49:35.099
I want you to have them.

01:49:35.100 --> 01:49:36.600
Thank you.

01:49:40.900 --> 01:49:43.132
And, Tina...

01:49:43.133 --> 01:49:45.366
If you don't get this part,

01:49:45.367 --> 01:49:48.633
for Christ's sake,
don't hock 'em.

01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:53.467
Oh, I wouldn't.

01:49:57.267 --> 01:49:59.367
Thank you, mommie.

01:50:10.900 --> 01:50:13.866
Hey, don't be a stranger.

01:50:13.867 --> 01:50:14.833
No.

01:50:22.833 --> 01:50:25.332
Is it 4:00 yet?

01:50:25.333 --> 01:50:26.632
It's five after.

01:50:26.633 --> 01:50:28.932
Five after?
Turn the set on now.

01:50:28.933 --> 01:50:29.966
All right.

01:50:29.967 --> 01:50:32.232
I want that set on every day...

01:50:32.233 --> 01:50:34.699
At 4:00 sharp.

01:50:34.700 --> 01:50:38.032
<i>Well, I'm going to try</i>
<i>to make him happy,</i>

01:50:38.033 --> 01:50:39.666
<i>you know, in every way.</i>

01:50:39.667 --> 01:50:41.867
<i>You two make a lovely couple.</i>

01:50:44.033 --> 01:50:47.766
<i>Well, I want so much</i>
<i>to be a good wife.</i>

01:50:47.767 --> 01:50:48.966
<i>You will be.</i>

01:50:48.967 --> 01:50:51.666
<i>But there's so much to learn.</i>

01:50:51.667 --> 01:50:54.000
<i>Don't worry. Love
conquers all, right?</i>

01:50:55.333 --> 01:50:57.866
<i>You're so good to me, Susan.</i>

01:50:57.867 --> 01:50:59.866
<i>You're so understanding.</i>

01:50:59.867 --> 01:51:01.932
<i>And your mother,</i>
<i>how's she doing?</i>

01:51:01.933 --> 01:51:03.599
<i>Oh, you know mom.</i>

01:51:03.600 --> 01:51:06.632
<i>I think she's been secretly
planning this for years.</i>

01:51:06.633 --> 01:51:08.866
<i>You're in good hands, then.</i>

01:51:08.867 --> 01:51:11.333
<i>Sometimes I feel like</i>
<i>it's her wedding.</i>

01:51:12.767 --> 01:51:15.232
<i>But Bruce is being good.</i>

01:51:15.233 --> 01:51:17.866
<i>Although, I know he
feels very far removed</i>

01:51:17.867 --> 01:51:19.833
<i>from all the planning.</i>

01:51:24.033 --> 01:51:26.032
She's doing quite well,

01:51:26.033 --> 01:51:27.500
don't you think?

01:51:28.900 --> 01:51:30.999
She's improving.

01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:34.132
A lot of fans have written

01:51:34.133 --> 01:51:36.532
how impressed they
are with Christina

01:51:36.533 --> 01:51:40.133
and how proud you must
be of her acting.

01:51:41.567 --> 01:51:43.099
Well...

01:51:43.100 --> 01:51:46.199
Something good had to rub off.

01:51:46.200 --> 01:51:48.433
Come on, let's get to work.

01:51:59.500 --> 01:52:00.600
Ohh.

01:52:01.700 --> 01:52:02.700
Ohh.

01:52:20.467 --> 01:52:21.467
Ohh...

01:52:56.633 --> 01:52:58.700
Mommie...

01:53:10.167 --> 01:53:11.200
Miss Crawford.

01:53:15.167 --> 01:53:17.132
I'm belinda Rosenberg,
Christina's producer.

01:53:17.133 --> 01:53:18.499
How do you do?

01:53:18.500 --> 01:53:19.499
Fine.

01:53:19.500 --> 01:53:21.066
Thank you so much
for calling us.

01:53:21.067 --> 01:53:22.832
She'll be fine. How is she?

01:53:22.833 --> 01:53:26.466
It was an ovarian tumor, but
completely benign, thank god.

01:53:26.467 --> 01:53:27.499
Thank god.

01:53:27.500 --> 01:53:29.299
It's a rotten break for her.

01:53:29.300 --> 01:53:32.399
Tell me, this won't affect
her job in any way, will it?

01:53:32.400 --> 01:53:35.066
Well, how long
will she be here?

01:53:35.067 --> 01:53:37.799
Well, the doctor's
not sure yet.

01:53:37.800 --> 01:53:39.532
Uh...

01:53:39.533 --> 01:53:40.899
Tell you what.

01:53:40.900 --> 01:53:42.599
Let me call you tomorrow.

01:53:42.600 --> 01:53:44.132
We'll discuss it.

01:53:44.133 --> 01:53:45.232
Please.

01:53:45.233 --> 01:53:46.467
Good.

01:53:54.367 --> 01:53:55.832
Your TV show is on.

01:53:55.833 --> 01:53:57.466
Don't you want to watch?

01:53:57.467 --> 01:54:02.532
To see how well
they manage without me?

01:54:02.533 --> 01:54:04.732
To see your mother.

01:54:04.733 --> 01:54:08.966
They just announced your mother
is going to stand in for you

01:54:08.967 --> 01:54:10.932
until you're well.

01:54:10.933 --> 01:54:12.167
Oh.

01:54:13.633 --> 01:54:17.066
She can't.

01:54:17.067 --> 01:54:21.499
My character's
only 28 years old.

01:54:21.500 --> 01:54:22.766
<i>Bill...</i>

01:54:22.767 --> 01:54:24.600
<i>Could you, uh...</i>

01:54:30.333 --> 01:54:32.300
<i>Could you call...</i>

01:54:39.233 --> 01:54:42.199
<i>You want me</i>
<i>to call Cindy for you?</i>

01:54:42.200 --> 01:54:43.433
<i>Yes.</i>

01:54:45.100 --> 01:54:47.066
<i>You know, she, uh...</i>

01:54:47.067 --> 01:54:48.667
<i>She wants to...</i>

01:54:54.833 --> 01:54:57.766
<i>Uh, I know she wants to</i>
<i>have an affair with Robert.</i>

01:54:57.767 --> 01:55:01.467
But are you sure
his divorce is final?

01:55:03.667 --> 01:55:05.367
His divorce is final?

01:55:07.500 --> 01:55:09.966
Fade and out.

01:55:09.967 --> 01:55:11.732
Miss Crawford,
are you all right?

01:55:11.733 --> 01:55:14.533
Oh, fine. Just nervous as hell.

01:55:15.633 --> 01:55:17.632
Give me a drink,
and I'll be all right.

01:55:17.633 --> 01:55:20.132
We've only got
another 90 seconds.

01:55:20.133 --> 01:55:21.666
Now, you're doing swell.

01:55:21.667 --> 01:55:24.666
You just, uh,
keep finding those, uh...

01:55:24.667 --> 01:55:26.032
Cue cards.

01:55:26.033 --> 01:55:29.032
That's the problem. The cue
cards are too goddamn low.

01:55:29.033 --> 01:55:31.966
Tell them to bring
them up higher, huh?

01:55:31.967 --> 01:55:33.899
I think that's
where I went wrong.

01:55:33.900 --> 01:55:35.199
Right. Uh...

01:55:35.200 --> 01:55:36.799
You all right?

01:55:36.800 --> 01:55:37.766
Mm-hmm.

01:55:37.767 --> 01:55:38.767
O.K. Go.

01:55:40.500 --> 01:55:41.467
You're perfect.

01:55:43.800 --> 01:55:45.699
In 10, please.

01:55:45.700 --> 01:55:47.733
9...8...

01:55:51.667 --> 01:55:54.132
3...2...

01:55:54.133 --> 01:55:56.166
1.

01:55:56.167 --> 01:55:58.367
Now, what about us?

01:56:00.233 --> 01:56:02.033
What about our situation?

01:56:04.167 --> 01:56:06.532
Maybe we should elope.

01:56:06.533 --> 01:56:07.500
No.

01:56:09.700 --> 01:56:10.966
Absolutely not.

01:56:10.967 --> 01:56:12.933
I was afraid of that.

01:56:17.533 --> 01:56:19.500
<i>Oh, be serious, now, bill.</i>

01:56:20.967 --> 01:56:23.632
<i>Mother and I have</i>
<i>to make plans today.</i>

01:56:23.633 --> 01:56:25.299
<i>I was serious.</i>

01:56:25.300 --> 01:56:28.066
<i>Think of all the work</i>
<i>we'll save your mother.</i>

01:56:28.067 --> 01:56:31.466
<i>Mom loves every minute of it.</i>

01:56:31.467 --> 01:56:34.799
<i>Don't you have any more</i>
<i>romantic ideas?</i>

01:56:34.800 --> 01:56:37.000
<i>Small, simple ceremony?</i>

01:56:38.433 --> 01:56:41.599
<i>It'll be grand.</i>

01:56:41.600 --> 01:56:43.266
<i>And don't worry about me.</i>

01:56:43.267 --> 01:56:44.533
Turn it off.

01:56:45.933 --> 01:56:47.933
Turn it off.

01:57:08.900 --> 01:57:11.532
Come on in.

01:57:11.533 --> 01:57:15.132
Here's everything your mother
picked out for you, dear.

01:57:15.133 --> 01:57:17.232
Let me take that from you.

01:57:17.233 --> 01:57:19.866
My god, Carol Ann.

01:57:19.867 --> 01:57:23.032
She's still picking out
my clothes for me.

01:57:23.033 --> 01:57:26.299
She went to such lengths
to pick out

01:57:26.300 --> 01:57:28.532
just the right colors for you.

01:57:28.533 --> 01:57:30.766
Well, I hope it fits.

01:57:30.767 --> 01:57:32.932
It is pretty.

01:57:32.933 --> 01:57:34.299
Pretty colors.

01:57:34.300 --> 01:57:38.600
Carol Ann, can I get you
a cup of tea or something?

01:57:42.300 --> 01:57:43.367
Carol Ann?

01:57:47.133 --> 01:57:48.467
Carol Ann?

01:57:49.600 --> 01:57:51.066
What is it?

01:57:51.067 --> 01:57:53.299
Oh, Christina...

01:57:53.300 --> 01:57:54.800
What's the matter?

01:57:55.800 --> 01:57:57.200
Your mother...

01:57:58.767 --> 01:58:01.266
Is going to be so alone

01:58:01.267 --> 01:58:03.499
when you leave.

01:58:03.500 --> 01:58:05.567
Don't you worry.

01:58:07.867 --> 01:58:09.467
She'll be all right.

01:58:12.467 --> 01:58:14.000
She always is.

01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:30.000
Hello.

01:58:31.600 --> 01:58:33.000
Yes, mommie.

01:58:34.667 --> 01:58:37.132
No, she's here. Uh-huh.

01:58:37.133 --> 01:58:39.899
Mommie, I told you,

01:58:39.900 --> 01:58:42.767
I want to do it for you.

01:58:46.900 --> 01:58:48.532
As the final event

01:58:48.533 --> 01:58:50.132
of this prestigious evening,

01:58:50.133 --> 01:58:51.999

01:58:56.167 --> 01:58:59.799
not only as an academy
award-winning actress,

01:58:59.800 --> 01:59:03.766
<i>but also as a business

01:59:38.933 --> 01:59:39.933
<i>Thank you.</i>

01:59:42.467 --> 01:59:44.999
<i>Thank you,</i>

01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:47.666

<i>on behalf of my mother</i>

01:59:53.833 --> 01:59:55.899
<i>When I spoke with her,</i>

01:59:55.900 --> 01:59:58.399
<i>she asked me to convey to you</i>

01:59:58.400 --> 02:00:00.932
<i>her deepest gratitude.</i>

02:00:00.933 --> 02:00:02.732
<i>She wanted so much</i>

02:00:02.733 --> 02:00:04.932
<i>to be here in person tonight,</i>

02:00:04.933 --> 02:00:06.432
<i>but...</i>

02:00:06.433 --> 02:00:09.732
<i>She was simply not well enough.</i>

02:00:09.733 --> 02:00:14.232
<i>I know she would want me</i>
<i>to say thank you</i>

02:00:14.233 --> 02:00:16.266
<i>to each...</i>

02:00:16.267 --> 02:00:18.632
<i>And every one of you</i>

02:00:18.633 --> 02:00:21.732
<i>who made this honor possible.</i>

02:00:21.733 --> 02:00:24.500
<i>And on a more personal note...</i>

02:00:26.667 --> 02:00:29.800
<i>I would like to say</i>
<i>directly to her...</i>

02:00:34.900 --> 02:00:37.800
<i>Congratulations.</i>

02:00:39.167 --> 02:00:41.299
<i>And...</i>

02:00:41.300 --> 02:00:43.833
<i>I love you...</i>

02:00:47.867 --> 02:00:50.632
<i>Mommie dearest.</i>

02:00:50.633 --> 02:00:53.267
<i>Thank you so much.</i>

02:01:35.800 --> 02:01:38.100
Oh, mommie.

02:01:43.900 --> 02:01:45.900
I always loved you so.

02:01:49.600 --> 02:01:50.933
It's over.

02:01:53.200 --> 02:01:55.000
The pain.

02:01:56.833 --> 02:01:58.967
There's no more pain.

02:02:00.667 --> 02:02:02.600
You're free.

02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:09.832
You're free.

02:02:09.833 --> 02:02:13.132
Oh, mommie.

02:02:13.133 --> 02:02:15.200
Mommie.

02:02:27.633 --> 02:02:29.867
Oh, mommie.

02:02:38.400 --> 02:02:41.066
Christopher.

02:02:41.067 --> 02:02:43.167
Oh, I'm so glad you're here.

02:02:46.233 --> 02:02:47.332
You o.K.?

02:02:47.333 --> 02:02:48.699
Yeah.

02:02:48.700 --> 02:02:49.699
You?

02:02:49.700 --> 02:02:50.700
I'm o.K.

02:02:52.800 --> 02:02:54.966
Did you meet David, my husband?

02:02:54.967 --> 02:02:56.266
Yeah.

02:02:56.267 --> 02:02:58.267
Let's go out, get some air.

02:03:00.600 --> 02:03:01.932
Miss Crawford,

02:03:01.933 --> 02:03:04.166
I've always been such a
fan of your mother's.

02:03:04.167 --> 02:03:07.832
I do hope you feel
we've done her justice.

02:03:07.833 --> 02:03:11.232
Actually, I worked from my own
personally autographed photo

02:03:11.233 --> 02:03:12.699
of your mother.

02:03:12.700 --> 02:03:15.366
You did a beautiful job.

02:03:15.367 --> 02:03:16.699
She looked lovely.

02:03:16.700 --> 02:03:18.132
Thank you.

02:03:18.133 --> 02:03:19.400
Thank you.

02:03:34.500 --> 02:03:36.866
Christina.

02:03:36.867 --> 02:03:37.867
Carol.

02:03:43.933 --> 02:03:45.400
My dear Tina.

02:03:51.133 --> 02:03:53.500
She always loved you...

02:03:55.533 --> 02:03:57.566
So very much...

02:03:57.567 --> 02:03:58.933
Christina.

02:04:00.733 --> 02:04:02.367
I need to believe that.

02:04:04.933 --> 02:04:07.400
I need so much...

02:04:09.467 --> 02:04:12.866
To be able to believe that now.

02:04:12.867 --> 02:04:14.700
She did.

02:04:22.833 --> 02:04:25.266
Here it is.

02:04:25.267 --> 02:04:28.733
This is the section pertaining
to you and Christopher.

02:04:31.367 --> 02:04:32.400
Ahem.

02:04:34.033 --> 02:04:35.899
"It is my intention

02:04:35.900 --> 02:04:38.199
"to make no provision herein

02:04:38.200 --> 02:04:40.200
"for my son Christopher...

02:04:42.067 --> 02:04:44.599
"And my daughter Christina

02:04:44.600 --> 02:04:48.600
"for reasons which
are well-known to them."

02:04:50.800 --> 02:04:52.933
What reasons? I mean...

02:04:59.467 --> 02:05:02.633
Jesus Christ.

02:05:09.900 --> 02:05:12.867
As usual,
she has the last word.

02:05:20.667 --> 02:05:21.667
Does she?

02:05:34.767 --> 02:05:36.133
Does she?
