WEBVTT

02:32.420 --> 02:33.954
At ease.

02:35.756 --> 02:36.990
Well, let's get to it.

02:36.990 --> 02:39.493
I've never known you
any other way.

02:39.493 --> 02:41.729
An intelligence binder.

02:41.729 --> 02:43.797
It's fallen into enemy hands.

02:43.797 --> 02:45.499
It has the names and locations

02:45.499 --> 02:47.268
of hundreds of
Vietnamese operatives

02:47.268 --> 02:49.002
working with our military.

02:50.003 --> 02:52.840
As you can imagine,
it's imperative

02:52.840 --> 02:55.175
that their identities
not fall into the Viet Cong.

02:57.278 --> 02:59.647
That binder must be
retrieved and destroyed

02:59.647 --> 03:01.582
at any cost.

03:01.582 --> 03:03.150
Understood.

03:03.150 --> 03:06.987
We sent two Special Forces teams
north to recapture it.

03:06.987 --> 03:08.622
They're en route back to us.

03:08.622 --> 03:11.525
- Where?
- North of DMC.

03:11.525 --> 03:14.094
Small outpost
in the Quang Tri province.

03:14.094 --> 03:15.763
The area's hot.

03:15.763 --> 03:17.965
If the Viet Cong discover
the binder is missing...

03:17.965 --> 03:19.800
They'll send
a division after it.

03:19.800 --> 03:21.168
Expect a firefight.

03:21.168 --> 03:23.971
- When do I leave?
- Chopper's ready.

03:23.971 --> 03:25.873
I'm sending Crawford with you.

03:25.873 --> 03:28.008
Crawford?

03:28.008 --> 03:29.843
What aren't you telling me?

03:29.843 --> 03:32.079
It's chess.

03:33.080 --> 03:35.182
Let's stay 10 moves ahead.

04:29.236 --> 04:31.004
I'm Corporal Ackerman,
engineer, sir.

04:31.004 --> 04:32.906
- You in charge?
- Of the camp, yes, sir.

04:32.906 --> 04:35.208
The... the ARVN soldiers
fall under the Special Forces

04:35.208 --> 04:36.710
who are training them, sir.

04:36.710 --> 04:38.379
Leaving you the tents?

04:38.379 --> 04:40.748
Sir?

04:40.748 --> 04:43.584
Do you understand
the nature of my presence here?

04:43.584 --> 04:46.153
No, sir. Your mission has not
been disclosed to me, sir.

04:47.154 --> 04:49.022
Take me to HQ.

04:49.022 --> 04:50.491
This way, sir.

04:59.232 --> 05:00.534
What are your orders?

05:00.534 --> 05:02.135
Sir, to assess
the viability of this site

05:02.135 --> 05:03.537
as a forward base location,

05:03.537 --> 05:05.272
study the topography,
sightlines, threat levels,

05:05.272 --> 05:07.741
evaluate what construction
equipment is needed for a base

05:07.741 --> 05:09.710
and to establish a 100% secure

05:09.710 --> 05:11.945
camp perimeter
concurrently, sir.

05:11.945 --> 05:14.047
- Concurrently?
- Yes, sir.

05:14.047 --> 05:15.716
100% secure?

05:15.716 --> 05:17.918
That is the attitude
I must maintain, sir.

05:19.286 --> 05:22.390
A highly classified package
is due to be delivered here.

05:22.390 --> 05:24.958
- This has yet to occur. Correct?
- Yes, sir...

05:24.958 --> 05:27.227
Uh, no. No, sir.
It has not occurred, sir.

05:27.227 --> 05:28.962
To be painfully clear,

05:28.962 --> 05:31.331
if any package,
no matter how small,

05:31.331 --> 05:34.134
were brought to this location,
you would know about it?

05:35.135 --> 05:36.804
I'm in charge of the camp, sir.

05:36.804 --> 05:38.305
Except for the ARVN soldiers

05:38.305 --> 05:40.173
and the Special Forces commandos.

05:40.173 --> 05:41.609
Except for them, sir.

05:43.611 --> 05:45.312
Leaving you the tents.

05:45.312 --> 05:46.780
Sir?

05:46.780 --> 05:48.449
Dismissed.

05:58.559 --> 06:00.360
Easy.

06:11.672 --> 06:16.877
Belt-fed, gas-operated,
1,800 metres effective rounds.

06:31.058 --> 06:34.662
Hey. Uh, do you
need help with anything?

06:34.662 --> 06:35.896
Well,
aren't you eager?

06:35.896 --> 06:37.330
- Sir.
- What?

06:37.330 --> 06:39.399
Did you find out what
we are really doing out here?

06:39.399 --> 06:40.901
They're not building
a base out here, right?

06:40.901 --> 06:41.969
- We're too exposed.
- Guys...

06:41.969 --> 06:43.537
Is that what
that captain... Wait.

06:43.537 --> 06:45.839
That guy is a captain, right?
Is that what he's doing here?

06:45.839 --> 06:47.908
I'm assuming you told him
we've been done here for weeks.

06:47.908 --> 06:49.042
- I mean...
- Guys! Guys, guys, guys!

06:49.042 --> 06:50.511
Please, please. I, um...

06:50.511 --> 06:52.045
I just need to know if, uh...

06:52.045 --> 06:53.814
Have you seen a package
get delivered here?

06:53.814 --> 06:56.584
A package? Do we get
mail service out here?

06:56.584 --> 06:58.251
- No. No, no, no. Never mind.
- No, we...

06:58.251 --> 07:01.889
Never mind. Just... as you were.
Forget about it. Thank you.

07:01.889 --> 07:04.391
- Hey, hey!

07:06.026 --> 07:08.228
I need to be painfully clear
about something.

07:08.228 --> 07:10.263
Have either of you witnessed
the Special Forces boys

07:10.263 --> 07:12.232
receive a package
to this location?

07:12.232 --> 07:14.702
Mail? We don't get
mail service out here.

07:14.702 --> 07:17.437
No. No, not like mail.

07:17.437 --> 07:19.406
And not officially delivered.

07:19.406 --> 07:21.742
- Covertly brought here.
- No.

07:21.742 --> 07:23.210
You seen anything
that looked like that?

07:23.210 --> 07:25.445
- No, nothing like that.
- Well, you know how they are.

07:25.445 --> 07:26.880
They might not disclose
something like that

07:26.880 --> 07:28.882
to the engineers,
but I need to know

07:28.882 --> 07:31.118
everything that goes on
inside this camp, alright?

07:31.118 --> 07:33.787
- You feel like you don't?
- Yes.

07:33.787 --> 07:36.123
No, I...

07:36.123 --> 07:38.358
I do not have eyes
on 50 men, alright?

07:38.358 --> 07:40.427
So I asked my team for
a little bit of assistance.

07:40.427 --> 07:42.229
- You are a part of this team?
- Yes, sir.

07:42.229 --> 07:45.365
Yeah, I am part
of your team, sir.

07:45.365 --> 07:47.034
Who's the new captain?

07:47.034 --> 07:48.636
He's just a new captain.

07:48.636 --> 07:51.004
Were you supposed to have
a package for him?

07:52.806 --> 07:55.275
Never mind.
As you were.

08:10.858 --> 08:12.325
- You seen a package?
- My friend.

08:12.325 --> 08:13.894
- What?
- I need you to get down.

08:13.894 --> 08:16.797
- And grab yourself a rifle.
- Why? What do you see?

08:17.798 --> 08:19.967
- Movement.
- Where?

08:19.967 --> 08:21.535
Somewhere.

08:34.381 --> 08:35.916
American?!

08:35.916 --> 08:37.818
American!

08:43.056 --> 08:44.858
Your engineers set mines
around the camp, right?

08:44.858 --> 08:46.293
Uh-huh.

08:46.293 --> 08:48.128
Please safely escort our guests.

08:48.128 --> 08:50.664
Oh, yeah. Yeah. OK.

08:54.034 --> 08:55.636
Shit.

08:58.138 --> 08:59.840
OK.

08:59.840 --> 09:02.242
Hi. How you doing?
I'm Corporal Ackerman.

09:04.177 --> 09:06.213
- Water?
- Water? Yeah.

09:06.213 --> 09:08.181
Yeah, we have water.
Sure. You want some?

09:08.181 --> 09:10.718
Um, OK, just follow me.
Uh, we got some at the base.

09:10.718 --> 09:11.985
You have to be careful

09:11.985 --> 09:13.453
'cause we've got mines
around the perimeter.

09:13.453 --> 09:14.922
So just...

09:19.426 --> 09:22.596
Captain Mora,
Special Forces Commander.

09:23.697 --> 09:26.700
My family summers in Lake Tahoe.

09:26.700 --> 09:28.969
Are you familiar
with Lake Tahoe?

09:28.969 --> 09:31.571
Tahoe is a term
we are familiar with.

09:42.750 --> 09:44.184
Just the two of you?

09:45.185 --> 09:46.687
There were six of us, sir.

09:47.921 --> 09:50.223
Does the enemy know about this?

09:51.224 --> 09:53.060
There were six, sir.

09:54.061 --> 09:55.763
Safeties off tonight, sir.

09:58.431 --> 10:02.035
OK. Let's get you guys some R&R.

10:07.474 --> 10:10.443
Shit.
Friendly fire! Friendly fire!

10:18.518 --> 10:20.287
You're crazy.

10:23.924 --> 10:25.592
You don't want to do that.

10:30.397 --> 10:31.899
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

10:31.899 --> 10:34.634
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

10:36.069 --> 10:38.706
What the fuck were you doing?!

10:42.209 --> 10:44.244
I did not order you to breathe!

10:44.244 --> 10:47.114
I ordered you
to answer my question!

10:47.114 --> 10:48.749
Sir, he was
cleaning his weapon, sir.

10:48.749 --> 10:50.050
That is correct!

10:50.050 --> 10:51.584
He is under your command

10:51.584 --> 10:53.721
so you will answer for him!

10:53.721 --> 10:56.323
What the fuck was he doing?!

10:56.323 --> 10:58.458
Sir, he was cleaning
his weapon, sir!

10:58.458 --> 11:01.594
I ordered him to do it, sir.
Sir, it is my fault, sir!

11:01.594 --> 11:03.897
What the actual fuck

11:03.897 --> 11:06.366
does that child need with a gun?

11:07.367 --> 11:09.970
That was not
rhetorical, dipshit!

11:09.970 --> 11:11.772
Sir, protection
of this camp, sir!

11:11.772 --> 11:13.473
He does not protect.

11:13.473 --> 11:16.910
You and your engineers
do not protect.

11:16.910 --> 11:22.182
You build. You dig a ditch.
You plant some goddamn mines.

11:22.182 --> 11:27.587
But you sure as shit don't fire
your weapons in my perimeter!

11:27.587 --> 11:29.089
Sir, yes, sir!

11:29.089 --> 11:32.993
But what you can do
is help that fucking child

11:32.993 --> 11:38.866
build a world class
shit-eating latrine!

11:49.642 --> 11:51.812
I have it in my possession.

11:51.812 --> 11:53.847
Excellent.

11:53.847 --> 11:55.983
Describe the contents.

11:55.983 --> 11:58.485
I have a translator
on that right now.

11:58.485 --> 12:01.822
ETA for confirmation
is five hours.

12:01.822 --> 12:03.256
Confirmed.

12:04.925 --> 12:07.594
What type of documents are
these, based on the structure?

12:10.063 --> 12:11.899
Maps and lists.

12:11.899 --> 12:14.167
Does it read like a ledger?

12:14.167 --> 12:15.668
Yes.

12:17.037 --> 12:18.505
Listen to me.

12:18.505 --> 12:21.541
Cross-reference the words
from the ledger

12:21.541 --> 12:23.543
and scan the map.

12:23.543 --> 12:25.478
Yes, there is a relationship

12:25.478 --> 12:29.883
between the markings on the maps
and the words in the columns.

12:29.883 --> 12:33.620
See if the same words appear
on the maps in the binder.

12:34.687 --> 12:36.423
Yeah, I recognise them.

12:36.423 --> 12:39.759
This is Trie Phong,
right in our own backyard.

12:39.759 --> 12:41.995
Well, it seems we have a map

12:41.995 --> 12:44.464
of potential locations
to operatives, doesn't it?

12:48.401 --> 12:51.371
The sooner we get this
to a secure base, the better.

12:51.371 --> 12:53.941
How long until extraction?

12:53.941 --> 12:55.508
ASAP, first thing tomorrow,

12:55.508 --> 12:57.610
barring a marine layer
or any other bullshit.

12:57.610 --> 12:59.546
Confirmed.

13:02.349 --> 13:05.919
- Oh, you missed the move.

13:05.919 --> 13:07.554
Hey, buddy.

13:08.555 --> 13:10.223
What the fuck you want?

13:10.223 --> 13:12.092
Do we help them?

13:12.092 --> 13:14.061
What? Dig a shithole?

13:14.061 --> 13:16.129
OK, yeah, yeah.
You could go if you want.

13:16.129 --> 13:18.731
But, hey, make sure you're
sleeping outside tonight, OK,

13:18.731 --> 13:21.234
'cause I don't want to have
nobody stinkin' up the place.

13:21.234 --> 13:22.769
You already stink enough.

13:22.769 --> 13:24.404
But it's not
our call, is it?

13:24.404 --> 13:26.940
We have to follow our...
our leader.

13:26.940 --> 13:30.210
Come on, man.
What's in the binder?

13:30.210 --> 13:32.079
Wait, you looked in the package?

13:33.613 --> 13:35.548
Tell me you're kidding.

13:35.548 --> 13:38.018
Is everyone in this squad
a fucking moron?

13:42.990 --> 13:44.925
Come on.

13:46.593 --> 13:48.461
Let me tell you something, guys.

13:49.529 --> 13:51.331
I don't have a good hand.

13:51.331 --> 13:52.966
I haven't had
a good hand all night.

13:52.966 --> 13:56.469
Uh, so if you could, like,
trade, that'd be good.

13:56.469 --> 13:58.538
- You trying to...
- What was in it?

14:01.141 --> 14:03.977
Words, the letters,
and the like, so...

14:03.977 --> 14:05.512
Asshole.

14:05.512 --> 14:08.281
Look, honestly,
half of it was in Viet Cong

14:08.281 --> 14:11.251
with some English code words
next to it, so...

14:11.251 --> 14:12.819
Like a ledger?

14:13.820 --> 14:15.989
- What do you mean, a ledger?
- A list.

14:17.657 --> 14:19.026
Yeah, like a list.

14:20.027 --> 14:21.861
Like why are so many
of us engineers and ARVN

14:21.861 --> 14:23.130
sitting out here for a month

14:23.130 --> 14:24.697
if we're not actually
building a base?

14:25.698 --> 14:27.500
Maybe Captain Mora is...

14:27.500 --> 14:28.835
Knows what our mission is

14:28.835 --> 14:30.470
once he decodes
whatever the binder is.

14:32.005 --> 14:35.108
Hey, what's his deal anyway?
Is he... is he in charge now?

14:35.108 --> 14:37.110
Is anyone in charge?

14:37.110 --> 14:39.179
Why do you rag on him so hard?

14:40.880 --> 14:43.450
Gates wants
a promotion.

14:43.450 --> 14:47.320
What do you guys think, huh?
Gates for corporal, 1966?

14:50.890 --> 14:52.025
Huh?

14:52.025 --> 14:53.360
You know, I'm afraid
there's gonna come

14:53.360 --> 14:55.695
a time when he gets
all of our asses killed.

14:56.896 --> 14:59.066
You stick close to Captain Mora.

14:59.066 --> 15:00.700
I'd rather have a hardass
giving me orders

15:00.700 --> 15:03.203
than a little buddy.

15:05.338 --> 15:06.406
Take all three.

15:31.898 --> 15:34.067
Oh, hey!

15:34.067 --> 15:36.703
This bullshit tastes
like horseshit this morning.

15:36.703 --> 15:38.938
Yeah, I know
that's right.

15:38.938 --> 15:40.840
Hey. I like it.

15:40.840 --> 15:43.076
Come on, man.

15:43.076 --> 15:46.613
You eat that rancid babyshit
and just do your job.

15:48.081 --> 15:49.582
Oh, right on.

15:49.582 --> 15:52.352
I'm crushed under the weight
of your rancid words, sir.

15:52.352 --> 15:53.886
So crushed.

15:53.886 --> 15:55.922
- Ain't that right, boy?
- Can I go home now?

15:55.922 --> 15:57.257
What kind
of horseshit are we

15:57.257 --> 15:58.591
not gonna be able to shit later?

15:58.591 --> 16:01.028
You know, the thing
with, um... with that

16:01.028 --> 16:04.097
is that MREs only contain
one gram of fibre, so...

16:04.097 --> 16:07.934
Did you sift through
your own shit to discover that?

16:07.934 --> 16:10.037
No, that information
was achieved

16:10.037 --> 16:11.438
through something
called reading.

16:11.438 --> 16:12.705
I'm reading that your face

16:12.705 --> 16:14.207
was so far up
Captain Mora's asshole

16:14.207 --> 16:16.276
that you just sampled it
off your nose.

16:19.379 --> 16:21.048
Damn, man!

16:21.048 --> 16:23.116
The ultra-smart
engineer has no reply?

16:23.116 --> 16:25.418
In front of your men?

16:25.418 --> 16:27.287
- Y'all want him to roast me?
- Whoo!

16:27.287 --> 16:29.289
- Come on, please.
- Come on, Ackerman.

16:29.289 --> 16:31.058
Ackerman!

16:31.058 --> 16:33.760
A true leader can out-shit-talk
a dumb grunt like me.

16:33.760 --> 16:35.928
- Not before my coffee.
- Well, that's no fun.

16:37.397 --> 16:39.332
Fuck! Get down!

16:40.667 --> 16:42.402
Fucking get down!

16:45.638 --> 16:48.308
Get down! Get down!

16:51.478 --> 16:52.845
Take cover!

18:02.915 --> 18:04.317
Arggh!

18:06.018 --> 18:07.720
Take cover!

18:07.720 --> 18:09.889
Go, go, go, go, go!

18:15.195 --> 18:17.230
- Arggh!

18:19.199 --> 18:21.234
Get your head
in the battle, son,

18:21.234 --> 18:24.036
and get to the .60 now!

18:24.036 --> 18:25.905
Yeah... Yes, sir.

18:54.167 --> 18:55.635
Fuck!

19:03.576 --> 19:06.979
Everyone, full assault! Now!

19:11.751 --> 19:13.220
Kill them all!

19:22.629 --> 19:25.765
No! No!

19:25.765 --> 19:28.301
God! Goddammit!

19:30.136 --> 19:31.971
Shit!

19:37.710 --> 19:39.879
-  Clear line.
- Captain.

19:42.048 --> 19:43.750
Give me a status report.

19:43.750 --> 19:46.085
14 casualties.

19:46.085 --> 19:48.355
40 enemy dead.

19:49.522 --> 19:50.923
And the binder?

19:50.923 --> 19:52.792
Gone.

19:52.792 --> 19:56.596
Then why are you
still alive? Huh!

19:56.596 --> 19:59.165
You fought off an ambush
outnumbered and surrounded.

19:59.165 --> 20:01.100
They knew the value
of what you had.

20:01.100 --> 20:02.802
Wow.

20:04.136 --> 20:07.206
To be fair, we didn't know
if the information was legit.

20:07.206 --> 20:09.141
I need to be
in the field, James.

20:10.142 --> 20:11.444
I don't know
what's really happening

20:11.444 --> 20:12.679
sittin' behind this desk.

20:12.679 --> 20:15.181
You can do a lot of good
at that desk.

20:15.181 --> 20:17.884
The army needs combat vets
calling the shots,

20:17.884 --> 20:19.986
not bureaucrats.

20:19.986 --> 20:21.988
Well, this office
is full of those.

20:23.723 --> 20:27.527
Dammit, James. I can't know the
enemy if I can't see 'em fight.

20:27.527 --> 20:29.729
Tell me the truth.

20:29.729 --> 20:32.499
- They're relentless and fast.
- Give me more.

20:32.499 --> 20:35.568
They'll face down the barrel
of your gun and charge in,

20:35.568 --> 20:37.870
totally fearless.

20:37.870 --> 20:42.008
What it must be like to command
a platoon of men like that.

20:42.008 --> 20:44.644
We are fighting them
with engineers, sir.

20:44.644 --> 20:46.713
Special Forces might be
the tip of the spear,

20:46.713 --> 20:50.317
but the rest,
they're construction workers.

20:50.317 --> 20:52.385
We're up against
the clock, James.

20:52.385 --> 20:54.654
Whatever your orders are,

20:54.654 --> 20:56.689
I will not fail you again.

20:56.689 --> 20:59.459
We have any idea which
direction the attack came from?

21:00.427 --> 21:03.330
We were suddenly surrounded.

21:03.330 --> 21:06.333
And we have no trace on which
direction they left with?

21:06.333 --> 21:07.767
Minimal.

21:07.767 --> 21:11.404
The battle tore up
the remaining terrain.

21:11.404 --> 21:13.406
I'm gonna send someone in,

21:13.406 --> 21:15.542
someone who can
take care of this,

21:15.542 --> 21:17.744
someone who thinks
outside the box.

21:17.744 --> 21:19.078
Confirmed.

21:19.078 --> 21:20.980
This is a new kind of warfare.

21:27.954 --> 21:30.923
Sir. You, uh...
you asked for the map, sir?

21:34.794 --> 21:37.296
You've studied
the surrounding topography.

21:37.296 --> 21:40.633
If you had to guess,
which direction?

21:40.633 --> 21:42.301
Um, well, sir...

21:43.269 --> 21:45.304
...Cambodia is that way

21:45.304 --> 21:47.774
and Hanoi is that way.

21:51.177 --> 21:53.446
That is very fucking helpful.

22:22.775 --> 22:24.611
- Morning, sir.
- Good morning.

22:24.611 --> 22:27.146
Where's your boss?

22:27.146 --> 22:29.148
Captain Mora is CO.

22:29.148 --> 22:31.017
You can find him at HQ
with Ackerman.

22:32.018 --> 22:33.285
Alright.

22:53.305 --> 22:55.041
Captain Mora, sir?

22:55.041 --> 22:56.709
Lieutenant Colonel Miller.

22:57.910 --> 22:59.879
Drummond gave me a report
that you guys were attacked

22:59.879 --> 23:02.915
by an invisible enemy that
seemed to come out of nowhere.

23:03.916 --> 23:06.553
I'm not familiar
with that description.

23:08.521 --> 23:10.056
Now you are.

23:12.892 --> 23:14.961
- Ackerman, right?
- Yes, sir.

23:14.961 --> 23:16.195
Let's hear it.

23:16.195 --> 23:18.565
We had sightlines
going out 50 metres, sir.

23:18.565 --> 23:20.132
We surveyed
the surrounding topography

23:20.132 --> 23:21.568
and had claymores and flares

23:21.568 --> 23:23.335
set to tripwire
deep in the jungle.

23:24.904 --> 23:27.406
But they seemed to
bypass all that, right?

23:27.406 --> 23:29.308
- Yeah.
- Like it came out of nowhere?

23:29.308 --> 23:31.744
More practically speaking,

23:31.744 --> 23:34.080
we were dug in
and they moved about undetected

23:34.080 --> 23:36.348
because they're
familiar with the land.

23:37.349 --> 23:40.252
We need to find out
where they're going.

23:40.252 --> 23:41.888
Where they're going?

23:43.690 --> 23:45.692
Don't you mean
where they came from?

23:45.692 --> 23:47.694
No.

23:47.694 --> 23:49.395
Can you track them?

23:50.597 --> 23:52.231
That's the idea.

23:54.233 --> 23:56.936
We need to
find them immediately.

23:56.936 --> 23:59.739
Well, that is
usually the desire, sir.

23:59.739 --> 24:04.777
I'm not experiencing a sense
of urgency from you, sir.

24:04.777 --> 24:09.549
Well, Captain Mora,
huntin' is huntin'.

24:09.549 --> 24:11.951
There is
a highly classified document

24:11.951 --> 24:14.587
which is missing
and must be retrieved.

24:14.587 --> 24:17.223
Time is of the essence.

24:17.223 --> 24:19.225
I appreciate that, sir.

24:20.727 --> 24:22.729
- Ackerman.
- Sir?

24:22.729 --> 24:25.231
Get me a dead body,
a nice fresh one.

24:26.265 --> 24:27.600
Thank you, sir.

24:31.303 --> 24:33.039
What's with the kid?

24:33.039 --> 24:36.509
Engineer. Very green.

24:39.646 --> 24:41.280
Engineer, huh?

24:45.618 --> 24:47.253
Good.

24:47.253 --> 24:49.822
We're gonna need him
with what we'll find.

24:49.822 --> 24:51.357
And what is that?

24:53.159 --> 24:55.127
Well...

24:55.127 --> 24:58.430
...I expect to find
their subway system,

24:58.430 --> 24:59.799
so to speak.

25:02.935 --> 25:06.505
Your cooperation on this
is much appreciated, sir.

25:10.342 --> 25:12.945
Come on. Go on.

25:19.051 --> 25:20.386
Go on, boy.

25:22.054 --> 25:23.756
Come on. Come here.

25:23.756 --> 25:25.257
Hey. Look at me.

25:25.257 --> 25:27.259
Hey, you good?

25:27.259 --> 25:29.295
- Alright.

25:29.295 --> 25:31.330
Time to hunt.

25:31.330 --> 25:33.065
I'll need three teams.

25:36.035 --> 25:38.204
OK, boys, let's move out.

25:50.282 --> 25:52.919
- Come on.

25:54.186 --> 25:55.988
Not bad back there.

25:55.988 --> 25:57.523
That was you on the .60?

25:57.523 --> 25:59.225
Yeah.

25:59.225 --> 26:00.960
Hey, thanks.

26:00.960 --> 26:03.630
That's where a boot like you
will earn the rank.

26:03.630 --> 26:06.633
More importantly,
the respect of your men.

26:06.633 --> 26:09.869
You, uh, mind saying that
a little bit louder,

26:09.869 --> 26:12.471
how good a job I done,
just so the guys could hear?

26:12.471 --> 26:14.674
It doesn't work
that way out here.

26:14.674 --> 26:17.243
Nothing can be faked.
If I see it, they'll see it.

26:18.711 --> 26:20.880
You short term, Rusty?

26:20.880 --> 26:22.882
Double digits.

26:22.882 --> 26:25.517
I'm so short, I can't see
over the dogs up there.

26:26.518 --> 26:28.087
64 days and a wake-up

26:28.087 --> 26:30.122
and my ass is DD
out of the bush.

26:31.557 --> 26:32.892
You?

26:32.892 --> 26:35.294
Um, 325 days.

26:36.929 --> 26:38.965
How about you count
the months at this point?

26:46.205 --> 26:48.574
- Rusty!

26:50.843 --> 26:52.578
Medic!

27:01.187 --> 27:03.055
Cole, where you at?!

27:03.055 --> 27:04.623
Where you at?!

27:06.425 --> 27:08.861
C-team, get my six! Get my six!

27:08.861 --> 27:10.296
Wills!

27:12.665 --> 27:15.434
Move your men to the right.
Stay low. Go!

27:15.434 --> 27:17.804
Yes, sir. C-team!

27:28.681 --> 27:31.117
Wills! Go!

27:35.788 --> 27:38.891
Make way! Make way!
Make way left! Make way left!

27:38.891 --> 27:40.159
Stay left!

27:40.159 --> 27:42.028
Cole, I'm on your six!

27:45.932 --> 27:48.400
Hey! Left side!

27:48.400 --> 27:50.937
I got two! I got two!

28:03.850 --> 28:05.651
Now!

28:06.652 --> 28:07.954
Go!

28:18.230 --> 28:19.698
Clear!

28:39.752 --> 28:41.921
Right, go on. Go on.

28:44.891 --> 28:47.093
What... what is that?

28:58.771 --> 29:00.773
We're fighting a new enemy.

29:02.274 --> 29:05.978
They don't come from the sky,
they don't come across water

29:05.978 --> 29:07.914
and they don't come on land.

29:08.915 --> 29:11.017
They come from the earth.

29:11.017 --> 29:12.451
Flashlight.

29:57.296 --> 29:59.932
I need you to send
a message to Captain Mora.

29:59.932 --> 30:02.134
- Pay close attention.
- Yes, sir.

30:09.008 --> 30:10.476
What happened?

30:10.476 --> 30:11.978
It's to a tunnel.

30:11.978 --> 30:13.545
Miller said they can surface

30:13.545 --> 30:15.581
an entire regiment through them.

30:15.581 --> 30:17.749
They go on for miles.

30:17.749 --> 30:19.185
Miles?

30:23.589 --> 30:26.458
Did he say how long it would
take to cover miles of tunnel?

30:28.294 --> 30:29.795
He didn't.

30:29.795 --> 30:33.132
Miller's plan is to cover above

30:33.132 --> 30:34.600
and send a team below,

30:34.600 --> 30:37.569
see what's down there
and map it out for us.

30:37.569 --> 30:40.506
He said subterranean
warfare is new.

30:40.506 --> 30:42.741
A lot of unknowns.

30:42.741 --> 30:44.410
Crawford there?

30:44.410 --> 30:46.178
As requested.

30:47.213 --> 30:49.648
So we can expect the binder
is in the tunnels.

30:51.350 --> 30:53.152
And they have limited comms...

30:54.386 --> 30:56.455
...which gives us
a window of time.

30:57.456 --> 30:59.992
Do we have protocol
for tunnel warfare?

30:59.992 --> 31:01.660
No.

31:01.660 --> 31:03.195
Improvise.

31:05.531 --> 31:07.233
You got two hours.

31:08.467 --> 31:11.337
What's at the end of two hours?

31:11.337 --> 31:13.072
The end.

31:16.208 --> 31:19.145
Where do we put the pawns
and where do we put the queen?

31:19.145 --> 31:20.612
Bishops, rooks,

31:20.612 --> 31:23.649
knights, up on top.

31:26.585 --> 31:28.387
Pawns down below.

31:32.424 --> 31:34.326
And one queen with them.

31:34.326 --> 31:35.727
I'll go below.

31:35.727 --> 31:37.363
Negative.

31:38.364 --> 31:39.932
I need you above ground.

31:40.933 --> 31:43.669
Sir, my experience is an asset.

31:43.669 --> 31:45.737
You're my link in this fight.

31:45.737 --> 31:47.906
I can source a radio man.

31:47.906 --> 31:50.676
Are my orders received, Captain?

31:50.676 --> 31:53.812
Crystal clear, sir.

31:53.812 --> 31:55.447
Speak.

31:56.448 --> 31:57.883
They're kids.

31:57.883 --> 32:01.653
I'm afraid they don't have
the stones for close combat.

32:01.653 --> 32:03.755
Then tell them to grow a pair!

32:04.890 --> 32:08.060
Confirmed. Over and out.

32:08.060 --> 32:09.861
Captain, step aside.

32:09.861 --> 32:11.563
I want to speak
to Crawford in private.

32:14.600 --> 32:16.368
Stepping out.

32:28.214 --> 32:29.681
Sir.

32:29.681 --> 32:31.050
Crawford.

32:32.318 --> 32:34.720
Are you seeing
anything Mora hasn't?

32:34.720 --> 32:36.955
I believe you're asking
for a contingency plan

32:36.955 --> 32:39.058
when the two hours are up.

32:39.058 --> 32:41.393
Does a failsafe exist?

32:41.393 --> 32:42.794
It does.

32:43.795 --> 32:46.398
Is it an ironclad solution?

32:47.733 --> 32:49.635
It clears the board
of all the pieces,

32:49.635 --> 32:51.803
but that's only
a call you can make.

32:52.804 --> 32:55.741
Two hours, then clear it.

32:55.741 --> 32:57.809
10-4.

34:00.806 --> 34:02.808
OK. Understand me?

34:06.245 --> 34:08.547
We gotta get to L-4.

34:08.547 --> 34:10.449
We got two hours.

34:10.449 --> 34:12.684
Copy that.

34:12.684 --> 34:14.353
Let's brief them.

34:16.722 --> 34:19.057
Gentlemen, if I could
have your attention, please.

34:22.027 --> 34:23.795
A binder was stolen
during the battle

34:23.795 --> 34:25.297
that contains information

34:25.297 --> 34:28.134
about South Vietnamese
operatives north.

34:28.134 --> 34:32.338
We need to retrieve or destroy
that binder at all costs.

34:32.338 --> 34:34.740
Now, we will have teams
covering the jungle

34:34.740 --> 34:36.375
for enemy resurfacing,

34:36.375 --> 34:38.577
but we will have to send
a team below.

34:38.577 --> 34:40.479
Ackerman, your team's below.

34:40.479 --> 34:43.482
Cole, you're with them.
Cole takes the rear.

34:43.482 --> 34:45.851
The rest of you concentrate
on mapping that network.

34:45.851 --> 34:48.053
Sir, what does
my team offer, sir?

34:48.053 --> 34:50.722
Jesus, Ackerman.

34:50.722 --> 34:53.592
Are you seriously asking me why
you're being sent below, sir?

34:53.592 --> 34:55.827
Yes, I am, sir.

34:55.827 --> 34:57.296
OK.

34:58.697 --> 35:00.366
It's obvious.

35:00.366 --> 35:03.034
You're an engineer
and you're smart.

35:03.034 --> 35:06.004
I need your eyes to analyse
what's down there.

35:06.004 --> 35:08.207
I will provide
a detailed map, sir.

35:08.207 --> 35:10.442
Well,
I'd appreciate that, Ackerman.

35:10.442 --> 35:13.044
However, the priority
of this mission

35:13.044 --> 35:15.947
is the retrieval or
the destruction of that binder.

35:15.947 --> 35:17.916
While that is being pursued,

35:17.916 --> 35:20.952
I need you boys to focus
on mapping that network.

35:20.952 --> 35:24.523
And, boys, it's likely gonna
be a labyrinth down there.

35:24.523 --> 35:26.592
So watch your topknot.

35:26.592 --> 35:28.860
At minimum, you're recon.

35:28.860 --> 35:31.763
At best, you get in the shit
and you save the day

35:31.763 --> 35:34.032
and we all live above ground
as normal mammals.

35:34.032 --> 35:35.567
Yes, sir.

35:35.567 --> 35:37.603
We gonna save the day,
young man.

35:37.603 --> 35:39.338
Ackerman.

35:40.472 --> 35:42.241
Cole is your ace.

35:42.241 --> 35:45.043
If it gets hot, you lean on him.

35:45.043 --> 35:46.445
The rest of you boys,

35:46.445 --> 35:48.914
concentrate on mapping
that network

35:48.914 --> 35:50.816
and get back here alive.

35:52.318 --> 35:55.221
You have two hours
to complete your mission.

35:55.221 --> 35:57.789
What happens
at the end of two hours, sir?

35:59.024 --> 36:00.692
You have two hours.

36:02.160 --> 36:04.930
Lock and load,
gentlemen. Godspeed.

36:04.930 --> 36:08.600
Damn, man.
That's fucking narrow.

36:08.600 --> 36:10.168
I'll take point.

36:10.168 --> 36:12.070
I don't mind, sir.

36:12.070 --> 36:14.172
No, that's my job.

36:14.172 --> 36:16.442
Why don't you lead
from the middle,

36:16.442 --> 36:17.943
help Boyd and Tommy...

36:17.943 --> 36:19.445
Hey, sure thing.

36:19.445 --> 36:21.780
You ain't gotta ask.
Just make the order.

36:23.014 --> 36:24.483
Wait until
the person ahead of you

36:24.483 --> 36:26.117
gives the all clear
before descending.

37:37.222 --> 37:38.557
Clear!

38:18.096 --> 38:20.265
I'll see you
on the other side, man.

38:43.288 --> 38:45.924
These are cool, man.
They made all these?

38:51.797 --> 38:53.565
Hey,
count pace with me.

38:53.565 --> 38:55.767
Yeah, you got it.

39:03.074 --> 39:04.576
What the fuck?!

39:04.576 --> 39:08.046
Oh, shit! Fuck.

39:48.119 --> 39:49.254
Shh.

41:12.504 --> 41:14.272
Make space. Pass it along.

41:14.272 --> 41:16.241
Cole says make space.

41:20.779 --> 41:22.714
What's... what's your count
to this juncture?

41:22.714 --> 41:24.315
I got 35 metres. You?

41:24.315 --> 41:26.251
OK, I had 40.
That's close enough.

41:26.251 --> 41:28.119
Keep charting.

41:28.119 --> 41:29.688
OK.

41:33.358 --> 41:34.860
It's clear.

41:53.679 --> 41:55.246
What's the status?

41:55.246 --> 41:56.815
Mapping the tunnels.

41:56.815 --> 41:59.484
But, um, I think we...
we gotta split up or...

41:59.484 --> 42:00.819
We can split up.

42:00.819 --> 42:03.021
Who else can create
a map of the progress?

42:03.021 --> 42:04.956
Nevins.

42:06.558 --> 42:09.427
OK. He'll go with me
and another.

42:09.427 --> 42:11.096
Give me anyone difficult
off your hands,

42:11.096 --> 42:13.364
I'll see to it
they stay in line.

42:15.466 --> 42:17.936
Gledhill, Nevins,
you're going with Cole.

42:17.936 --> 42:20.105
So, Mera, Boyd, Gates,
you're with me.

42:20.105 --> 42:21.807
If any direction
gets too hot or confusing,

42:21.807 --> 42:23.642
we rendezvous back here, OK?

42:23.642 --> 42:24.943
Copy.

42:24.943 --> 42:26.211
OK.

42:26.211 --> 42:27.846
Let's move out.

42:37.589 --> 42:39.057
Shit.

42:57.876 --> 43:00.445
Hey,
I...I can take point.

43:01.446 --> 43:03.548
I need you
to cover my six.

43:03.548 --> 43:05.550
Don't you know
that's most important?

43:06.918 --> 43:09.054
Yeah, that's...
that's right, that's right.

43:09.054 --> 43:11.089
Hey, thanks for
your bravery, Gledhill.

43:12.257 --> 43:13.725
Yeah, no problem.

43:14.860 --> 43:17.028
God, you're a tool, man.

43:26.938 --> 43:29.207
OK, alright.

43:29.207 --> 43:32.177
Mera, I need you to take point.

43:32.177 --> 43:34.379
Go slow and don't go far.

43:35.814 --> 43:37.582
OK, sir. Yep.

43:38.750 --> 43:40.585
OK, Gates,
stay on our six.

43:40.585 --> 43:41.820
OK.

43:51.663 --> 43:54.232
- Fuck! Fuck!

43:54.232 --> 43:56.601
- Fuck! Shit!
- Mera, what the fuck?

43:56.601 --> 43:58.603
- Mera! Come on, get here!

43:58.603 --> 44:01.406
- Fuck, fuck!
- Here! Come on!

44:01.406 --> 44:04.075
- Mera!

44:04.075 --> 44:05.410
What's wrong?

44:05.410 --> 44:07.378
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

44:07.378 --> 44:10.381
Calm down, calm down.
It's OK. It's OK.

44:10.381 --> 44:11.917
What's wrong?

44:13.351 --> 44:15.320
- Holy shit.

44:15.320 --> 44:18.056
It's OK. It's alright.
You're good. It's alright.

44:18.056 --> 44:20.491
Oh...

44:20.491 --> 44:23.594
- It's alright.
- Can't these things kill me?

44:23.594 --> 44:28.233
No, they... they're just like
really bad bee stings.

44:28.233 --> 44:29.667
How you know that?

44:30.668 --> 44:32.170
I read about it.

44:32.170 --> 44:33.671
OK, listen, Mera.

44:33.671 --> 44:35.173
If we come across an exit shaft,

44:35.173 --> 44:37.608
I'm gonna send you and Gates
up and back to camp, OK?

44:37.608 --> 44:39.477
- Yes, sir.
- But I need you to get up.

44:39.477 --> 44:42.180
- You gotta get up, alright?
- OK, get up. Come on, come on.

44:42.180 --> 44:44.282
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

44:44.282 --> 44:45.817
Come across here.

44:46.818 --> 44:48.019
Alright.

44:49.387 --> 44:51.289
OK. Come on, boys.

44:57.028 --> 45:00.065
Easy, easy. Shh.

45:58.189 --> 45:59.657
Gledhill?

45:59.657 --> 46:01.392
Gledhill?

46:04.229 --> 46:06.898
Gledhill! Fuck.

46:19.310 --> 46:20.812
Gledhill?

46:23.548 --> 46:25.817
Oh! Ugh!

46:35.861 --> 46:37.428
Oh, fuck.

46:49.440 --> 46:51.542
Hey. You OK?

46:51.542 --> 46:53.611
He's fucking dead.

46:53.611 --> 46:55.446
Fuck.

46:55.446 --> 46:59.317
Oh, fuck. Fuck.

47:01.652 --> 47:05.656
Hey. Hey, look. We have to go.

47:06.925 --> 47:08.726
Look. Listen to me.

47:08.726 --> 47:10.428
We have to go.

47:10.428 --> 47:11.997
Come on.

47:31.482 --> 47:33.018
Stay here.

47:37.288 --> 47:38.356
Ugh!

47:39.824 --> 47:42.127
- Oh!

47:51.602 --> 47:54.072
Nevins, come here!

47:55.473 --> 47:58.743
Check... check them.
Check all of them.

48:04.015 --> 48:06.117
Find the goddamn binder.

48:06.117 --> 48:08.053
I...I can't.

48:08.053 --> 48:10.956
- I don't see shit.
- Just look.

48:14.425 --> 48:16.027
Hey, I have to...

48:16.027 --> 48:18.896
I just gotta find this thing
and I'll get you out of here.

48:18.896 --> 48:21.332
Hey, we'll get you topside
and it'll all be good, OK?

48:23.501 --> 48:25.170
It ain't here, brother.

48:25.170 --> 48:27.672
Fucking... fucking useless shit!

48:28.739 --> 48:31.042
Hey. Hey, prop me up.

48:31.042 --> 48:32.643
I command you.

48:32.643 --> 48:34.980
Now!

48:34.980 --> 48:37.082
OK, OK.

48:37.082 --> 48:38.516
Hey, hey, I got you.

48:38.516 --> 48:40.918
I got you, bro.
Come here, man. Come here.

48:48.859 --> 48:51.596
Fuck. Oh, fuck.

48:51.596 --> 48:53.598
Give me... give me the AK.

49:01.106 --> 49:03.408
Listen. Listen.

49:03.408 --> 49:05.710
They're closing on in.

49:05.710 --> 49:08.246
Your friend's dead.

49:08.246 --> 49:09.947
Go and get out of here.

49:09.947 --> 49:11.316
Hey.

49:12.917 --> 49:15.253
We don't leave men behind.

49:15.253 --> 49:17.388
That's a command.

49:18.589 --> 49:20.425
It's just war.

49:22.593 --> 49:24.229
It's just war.

49:27.232 --> 49:28.933
I'll buy you time.

49:32.837 --> 49:34.572
It's gonna be OK.

49:52.623 --> 49:54.625
Oh!

50:23.821 --> 50:25.056
Clear.

50:26.891 --> 50:29.860
OK. Mera, Boyd, I need you
to cover our exits.

50:31.962 --> 50:34.265
Oh, here we go.
Here we go.

50:34.265 --> 50:36.000
It's a...
it's not gonna be papers.

50:36.000 --> 50:37.335
It's... it's like a ledger.

50:37.335 --> 50:39.837
It's bound, like a book.

50:41.038 --> 50:42.507
Mera, exits!

50:42.507 --> 50:44.075
Yes, sir.

50:59.056 --> 51:00.525
- You see this?
- You found something?

51:00.525 --> 51:02.127
- It's a map.
- OK. OK.

51:02.127 --> 51:03.728
They're
trying to find our camp.

51:03.728 --> 51:05.830
Well, write some down.
Write some down.

51:05.830 --> 51:07.565
- Boyd!

51:07.565 --> 51:09.434
Boyd, I heard something.

51:11.769 --> 51:14.139
- See these?
- Oh, shit.

51:27.017 --> 51:28.919
Watch the rear!

51:28.919 --> 51:32.022
OK. OK. Let's go.

51:32.022 --> 51:33.891
Let's just give them
everything, right?

51:33.891 --> 51:36.261
- It's not here, man.
- How do you know that?

51:36.261 --> 51:38.996
Because you saw how many guys
came after it at camp.

51:38.996 --> 51:41.266
They wouldn't leave it
unguarded. Alright?

51:41.266 --> 51:43.768
And those shots we just heard,
that's our team.

51:43.768 --> 51:45.870
- We gotta find them.

51:45.870 --> 51:48.005
Let's go. Get up.

51:48.005 --> 51:50.241
Come on.

51:50.241 --> 51:51.776
OK.

52:38.022 --> 52:40.791
These fuckers need to come out
and start fighting like men.

52:42.360 --> 52:43.994
New objective.

52:43.994 --> 52:47.432
We take the fight to them,
put an end to this bullshit.

52:49.033 --> 52:50.935
We're in and out
in under an hour.

52:52.603 --> 52:55.640
An hour's up, anything
in that tunnel is dead.

52:55.640 --> 52:57.141
Come on.

53:34.479 --> 53:36.714
It's better for the dog
if we move in downwind.

53:36.714 --> 53:38.182
Copy.

53:44.322 --> 53:46.324
- What is it?

53:47.592 --> 53:49.560
- Bunker.
- Where?

53:49.560 --> 53:51.962
I don't know.
I gotta flank wide.

53:51.962 --> 53:54.465
How do you know?

53:54.465 --> 53:57.335
It's that nasty fermented
fish sauce they fucking eat.

53:57.335 --> 53:59.704
Dogs aren't the only ones
who can smell.

54:00.938 --> 54:03.140
You slacking on me, boy? Huh?

54:03.140 --> 54:05.676
- No!

54:05.676 --> 54:07.978
Alright, let's go.

54:09.847 --> 54:12.750
Move up. Slowly.

54:36.941 --> 54:38.409
Lights.

54:46.817 --> 54:48.252
Alright, we're clear.

54:48.252 --> 54:50.287
Shit.

54:54.291 --> 54:56.260
Oh, fuck, fuck.

54:56.260 --> 54:57.962
Look at the size
of this thing.

54:57.962 --> 54:59.730
You could feed a whole regiment.

54:59.730 --> 55:01.466
How many soldiers
you think are down here?

55:01.466 --> 55:02.967
That doesn't matter.

55:02.967 --> 55:05.436
We're at a dead end.
We gotta keep moving.

55:06.404 --> 55:09.273
- You know where we are?
- Yeah.

55:09.273 --> 55:11.141
Then why
are we at a dead end?

55:11.141 --> 55:12.477
Because it's a maze.

55:12.477 --> 55:14.812
You find your way through
by eliminating dead ends.

55:14.812 --> 55:17.081
- Stop.

55:17.081 --> 55:18.883
- Nevins?
- Ack?

55:18.883 --> 55:20.785
Hey, hey, hey,
come here, come here.

55:20.785 --> 55:23.087
- Oh, shit. You're hurt?
- Fuck, fuck.

55:23.087 --> 55:24.955
Hey, where's Gledhill?

55:24.955 --> 55:26.491
They're all fucking dead.

55:27.658 --> 55:29.794
- Gledhill's dead?
- Yeah.

55:29.794 --> 55:31.328
Cole?

55:31.328 --> 55:33.498
- It's his blood.
- No.

55:33.498 --> 55:36.601
Cole's gone? We're fucked.

55:36.601 --> 55:39.103
He was our best chance
of getting out of here!

55:39.103 --> 55:41.171
Tighten up. What happened?

55:41.171 --> 55:43.273
I...I don't fucking know, man.

55:43.273 --> 55:44.909
We... we found a room.

55:44.909 --> 55:47.244
I mean, everything fucking
just went to shit, man.

55:47.244 --> 55:49.747
We... we fucking found this room
and there was nothing in it.

55:49.747 --> 55:51.449
We searched the whole
fucking thing and I...

55:51.449 --> 55:52.983
...I just couldn't
find shit, man!

55:52.983 --> 55:54.519
- OK, it's alright.
- And then... and then...

55:54.519 --> 55:58.523
I, uh... I crawled back here.
I got bit by spiders and shit.

55:59.524 --> 56:01.325
Fuck, man. Fuck, fuck!

56:01.325 --> 56:03.461
This place is fucked, man.
We're all gonna fucking die!

56:03.461 --> 56:04.862
Hey, we're not, we're not.

56:04.862 --> 56:06.764
- We're not gonna die.
- Yeah? Do you know the exits?

56:06.764 --> 56:08.132
- Yes.
- Yeah? Then which fucking way?!

56:08.132 --> 56:09.467
He doesn't know
what he's doing.

56:09.467 --> 56:10.968
Yes, I do. I know where we are.

56:10.968 --> 56:13.438
- I know how to get out of here.
- Bullshit.

56:13.438 --> 56:15.606
That map tells you the same exit
that we already came,

56:15.606 --> 56:17.675
the same exit
we all already know.

56:17.675 --> 56:19.209
You are lost!

56:19.209 --> 56:20.811
We are about
a click away from camp

56:20.811 --> 56:22.212
so we're due for another exit.

56:22.212 --> 56:24.348
Now, I told Mera
I would get him out of here.

56:24.348 --> 56:27.518
That's what I'm gonna do.
But I need your help.

56:27.518 --> 56:29.386
Please, man.

56:29.386 --> 56:31.622
We've been, uh, yelling

56:31.622 --> 56:33.624
and... and they can
probably hear us.

56:33.624 --> 56:36.727
So can... can we move, please?

56:38.362 --> 56:40.230
Let's go.

57:38.388 --> 57:40.224
He's fucking lost, man.

57:41.258 --> 57:44.428
Hey, Gates for corporal, 1966.

57:45.730 --> 57:48.132
Double the space
between you.

57:48.132 --> 57:50.067
This is tighter.

58:27.572 --> 58:29.439
Mera?

58:33.578 --> 58:35.345
I got daylight.

58:35.345 --> 58:38.148
OK. Come on.

58:38.148 --> 58:41.451
Hey, you think
you can cover me?

58:41.451 --> 58:43.688
- Yeah. One second.
- OK.

59:00.537 --> 59:02.339
- You got me?
- Yeah, I got you.

59:02.339 --> 59:04.975
OK.

1:00:08.405 --> 1:00:09.907
- Friendly?!
- Yeah.

1:00:09.907 --> 1:00:11.776
- Who is it?
- It's Ackerman!

1:00:11.776 --> 1:00:14.344
I've got a wounded man!
Am I clear to come out?

1:00:14.344 --> 1:00:15.780
Hold your fire!

1:00:15.780 --> 1:00:17.782
They shot Mera!

1:00:17.782 --> 1:00:19.383
- Ackerman?
- Yeah?

1:00:19.383 --> 1:00:21.218
All clear. Come out.

1:00:21.218 --> 1:00:24.388
Guys, send Mera up!
Send him up. We're good.

1:00:32.162 --> 1:00:34.431
- Come on, Mera. Hey.
- Come on. Come on, man.

1:00:34.431 --> 1:00:36.133
- Come on, man.
- Come on. I got you, buddy.

1:00:36.133 --> 1:00:37.534
- No, no!
- I got you.

1:00:37.534 --> 1:00:38.936
OK,
I won't touch it. Here.

1:00:38.936 --> 1:00:41.071
- Come on. Come on.
- Come on, come on, come on.

1:00:41.071 --> 1:00:43.607
- Lay down. Lay down right here.

1:00:43.607 --> 1:00:45.309
- Where's he hit?

1:00:45.309 --> 1:00:47.111
Mera,
where'd they get you, buddy?

1:00:47.111 --> 1:00:49.446
- Huh? Where'd they get you?
- My shoulder.

1:00:49.446 --> 1:00:51.048
Shoulder?
It's his shoulder.

1:00:51.048 --> 1:00:53.483
- I can feel it in my body.
- OK. Alright.

1:00:53.483 --> 1:00:55.085
-  Please!
- It's OK.

1:00:55.085 --> 1:00:57.221
- You're gonna be alright.

1:00:57.221 --> 1:00:58.588
- Ackerman?
- Yeah.

1:00:58.588 --> 1:01:00.124
- On me.
- OK.

1:01:02.192 --> 1:01:04.294
It's alright, man.
It's alright. It's alright.

1:01:04.294 --> 1:01:06.931
Your boy's been shot
in his extremities.

1:01:06.931 --> 1:01:08.833
No organs or arteries damaged.

1:01:08.833 --> 1:01:10.467
He ain't gonna die.

1:01:10.467 --> 1:01:12.937
But his body is trying to panic
and go into shock.

1:01:12.937 --> 1:01:15.605
If that happens,
his life's in danger.

1:01:15.605 --> 1:01:18.175
What he needs right now
is people around him

1:01:18.175 --> 1:01:21.779
who aren't panicking,
who are firm and calm.

1:01:21.779 --> 1:01:24.849
You're his leader. What do you
think you should do?

1:01:24.849 --> 1:01:26.283
You're alright,
you're alright.

1:01:26.283 --> 1:01:28.652
- Yes, sir.
- You're alright. You're alright.

1:01:28.652 --> 1:01:30.687
Hey, uh... Hey, Mera?

1:01:32.790 --> 1:01:34.524
Hey. Hey, can you
do me a big favour?

1:01:34.524 --> 1:01:35.826
Can you hold this for me?

1:01:35.826 --> 1:01:38.495
Hey, so I just spoke
to the colonel.

1:01:38.495 --> 1:01:40.831
And you know what he said? Huh?

1:01:40.831 --> 1:01:43.267
Look at me. He said
you're gonna be fine.

1:01:43.267 --> 1:01:45.335
Huh?

1:01:45.335 --> 1:01:49.306
So... you're gonna
be fine, right? Yeah?

1:01:49.306 --> 1:01:51.341
- OK.
- OK, do me a favour.

1:01:51.341 --> 1:01:53.978
Breathe like
you're fine. Alright?

1:01:53.978 --> 1:01:56.713
- I'm going to be fine, sir.
- Yeah, you can breathe.

1:01:56.713 --> 1:01:59.149
OK, you three,
take him back to the camp

1:01:59.149 --> 1:02:01.786
and report his status
to Captain Mora.

1:02:01.786 --> 1:02:03.653
- It's you and me, cowboy.
- Copy that.

1:02:03.653 --> 1:02:06.824
- You got the documents?
- Yeah. Yeah.

1:02:06.824 --> 1:02:08.458
Wills, take a look.

1:02:08.458 --> 1:02:09.994
Can I see them?

1:02:11.361 --> 1:02:12.729
You want one, sir?

1:02:14.264 --> 1:02:15.833
Here you go.

1:02:17.868 --> 1:02:19.403
Mm-hm.

1:02:20.838 --> 1:02:22.339
What we got?

1:02:27.211 --> 1:02:29.279
- These ain't them.
- Fucking shit.

1:02:33.283 --> 1:02:35.219
We missing someone?

1:02:39.189 --> 1:02:40.657
Sorry.

1:02:40.657 --> 1:02:42.392
Cowboy, why...
why don't you take a minute?

1:02:42.392 --> 1:02:44.394
Mm, mm...

1:02:44.394 --> 1:02:47.331
Take 10 steps away.
Turn around.

1:02:47.331 --> 1:02:50.734
You are ordered to breathe.
You are ordered to be alone.

1:02:50.734 --> 1:02:52.302
Go on now.

1:03:04.081 --> 1:03:06.183
I'm sorry about your boys.

1:03:06.183 --> 1:03:07.918
Pretty hot down there, huh?

1:03:09.253 --> 1:03:11.388
It's heavy contact
with the enemy, sir.

1:03:11.388 --> 1:03:13.924
Two KIA and now one wounded.

1:03:13.924 --> 1:03:15.392
It twisted and turned.

1:03:15.392 --> 1:03:17.627
It's a very extensive system
down there, sir.

1:03:18.628 --> 1:03:21.298
You're just a click away
from forward camp.

1:03:21.298 --> 1:03:23.367
Yeah, that was roughly
my estimate.

1:03:23.367 --> 1:03:25.402
- Let me take a look.
- Yes, sir.

1:03:34.845 --> 1:03:36.646
You do this
just by counting steps?

1:03:36.646 --> 1:03:38.182
Been trying to.

1:03:40.084 --> 1:03:41.718
Is it accurate?

1:03:41.718 --> 1:03:43.888
I hope so.

1:03:43.888 --> 1:03:45.655
Gates, Boyd,

1:03:45.655 --> 1:03:47.992
I need you two to make me
a copy of this map.

1:03:47.992 --> 1:03:50.827
And, Gates, I want it
detailed as this one is.

1:03:50.827 --> 1:03:52.296
You got it. No problem.

1:03:52.296 --> 1:03:53.964
- I know you will.
- Alright.

1:03:57.367 --> 1:04:00.104
So you want the good news
or the bad news?

1:04:00.104 --> 1:04:01.838
How about the bad news, sir?

1:04:01.838 --> 1:04:03.573
The Mets lost.

1:04:03.573 --> 1:04:05.775
And you gotta go back inside.

1:04:09.646 --> 1:04:11.481
You did good, Ackerman.

1:04:11.481 --> 1:04:13.750
- You did real good.
- Yes, sir.

1:04:13.750 --> 1:04:15.352
Get some chow.

1:04:31.068 --> 1:04:32.402
Clear.

1:05:02.499 --> 1:05:03.934
Clear.

1:05:16.913 --> 1:05:18.482
Hey, hey.

1:05:21.518 --> 1:05:24.054
- Fuck.
- Hold your fire!

1:05:24.054 --> 1:05:25.489
- Friendlies?
- Yeah.

1:05:25.489 --> 1:05:27.191
Yeah, there's
four of us in here.

1:05:28.425 --> 1:05:30.360
Hey, you're, uh...
you're Crawford, right?

1:05:30.360 --> 1:05:33.097
Yeah. You're 'Hack', right?

1:05:33.097 --> 1:05:35.865
Ackerman, 'Ack'.
How many of you are there?

1:05:35.865 --> 1:05:37.434
There's three of us.
You find the binder?

1:05:37.434 --> 1:05:39.236
No, did you?

1:05:40.270 --> 1:05:42.372
Would I ask if I had?

1:05:42.372 --> 1:05:44.074
No.

1:05:44.074 --> 1:05:45.842
What's with the arsenal?

1:05:45.842 --> 1:05:47.744
Oh, we found
their weapons storage.

1:05:47.744 --> 1:05:49.379
About 50 metres down there,
turn right.

1:05:49.379 --> 1:05:50.747
Go grab yourself something.

1:05:50.747 --> 1:05:52.682
I think we're good.

1:05:52.682 --> 1:05:55.185
Suit yourself.
There's some good shit in there.

1:05:55.185 --> 1:05:56.753
Check this baby out.

1:05:56.753 --> 1:05:58.722
- Need a light?
- Hey, stop!

1:06:00.124 --> 1:06:01.891
It's not a fucking joke, man!

1:06:01.891 --> 1:06:03.393
Oh!

1:06:05.462 --> 1:06:07.764
Where are the rest of you? Lost?

1:06:07.764 --> 1:06:10.234
There were three casualties,
one wounded.

1:06:12.336 --> 1:06:15.205
Is what it is, hmm?

1:06:15.205 --> 1:06:18.442
Come on. Let's check this out,
see what we can find.

1:06:18.442 --> 1:06:20.910
Aren't you supposed to
be topside covering the exits?

1:06:22.812 --> 1:06:24.481
Let's go, big man.

1:06:53.009 --> 1:06:54.944
Recon down left,
see what you find.

1:06:54.944 --> 1:06:56.280
- Yeah.
- Ditch diggers?

1:06:56.280 --> 1:06:57.847
You're going right.

1:07:12.729 --> 1:07:14.864
You and me are gonna
hold this junction, chief.

1:07:19.869 --> 1:07:21.838
This ain't up for
discussion, kiddos.

1:07:25.242 --> 1:07:27.377
It's OK.
Just be careful.

1:07:54.938 --> 1:07:56.473
How you feeling, chief?

1:07:56.473 --> 1:07:59.243
I'm great.

1:08:01.411 --> 1:08:03.180
Too bad about those casualties.

1:08:04.948 --> 1:08:06.450
Yes, it is.

1:08:08.017 --> 1:08:10.987
Hell of a thing, sending all
you engineers into this shit.

1:08:10.987 --> 1:08:12.989
Yeah.

1:08:12.989 --> 1:08:15.492
Why you think they put this
whole mission on your shoulders?

1:08:15.492 --> 1:08:17.026
I don't know.

1:08:17.026 --> 1:08:19.028
You would have to ask
Captain Mora.

1:08:21.631 --> 1:08:23.867
Well, they want you
to find this thing,

1:08:23.867 --> 1:08:26.436
but what else is your objective?

1:08:26.436 --> 1:08:28.338
To map the tunnels.

1:08:31.875 --> 1:08:35.712
That's a mission, huh?
Draw maps?

1:08:38.448 --> 1:08:41.185
"What did you do
in the war, Daddy?"

1:08:41.185 --> 1:08:44.087
"Well, son, I drew maps."

1:08:48.392 --> 1:08:51.228
Wow. You got us figured out.

1:08:51.228 --> 1:08:54.398
Eh, wanna know my guess?

1:08:54.398 --> 1:08:57.301
- Sure.
- Bait.

1:08:58.635 --> 1:09:00.937
Send you down
hoping they'll go topside.

1:09:02.772 --> 1:09:05.609
How's that sit with you? Hmm?

1:09:07.143 --> 1:09:09.746
Hmm? Bait.

1:09:12.949 --> 1:09:16.085
Hmm.

1:09:16.085 --> 1:09:19.256
Less than an hour
of map-making left.

1:09:25.795 --> 1:09:28.665
Nothing that way. Just
a water well and a dead end.

1:09:28.665 --> 1:09:30.500
But no enemy contact.

1:09:31.835 --> 1:09:33.570
My team, on my six.

1:09:33.570 --> 1:09:37.140
Ackerman, you and your boys
hold this junction.

1:10:07.837 --> 1:10:10.039
- Arggh!

1:10:42.005 --> 1:10:43.507
Turn your lights off.

1:12:01.250 --> 1:12:03.086
Contact! Hold your fire.

1:12:04.087 --> 1:12:05.522
Hold your fire.

1:12:20.003 --> 1:12:21.605
Hey, what are you guys
waiting for?

1:12:21.605 --> 1:12:23.339
- Whoa, whoa! Leave them be!

1:12:23.339 --> 1:12:25.274
- What the fuck do you care?!
- He's barely alive.

1:12:25.274 --> 1:12:26.643
Yeah, well,
then it's a mercy kill...

1:12:26.643 --> 1:12:27.977
Hey, you leave them!

1:12:27.977 --> 1:12:29.613
There's no honour
in killing sick and wounded.

1:12:29.613 --> 1:12:31.014
Honour?!

1:12:31.014 --> 1:12:33.249
These guys sharpened stakes,
hid them in the ground,

1:12:33.249 --> 1:12:35.519
and Gledhill died on them, man!

1:12:35.519 --> 1:12:37.687
I'm sorry that you weren't there
to watch him bleed out!

1:12:37.687 --> 1:12:39.456
- Were you guys there for that?
- Relax.

1:12:39.456 --> 1:12:42.125
Relax? Relax? Is that
the honourable thing to do?!

1:12:42.125 --> 1:12:44.193
Look, I'm not trying to
take away from what you saw.

1:12:44.193 --> 1:12:46.295
But this is war, right?
It's what you signed up for!

1:12:46.295 --> 1:12:47.764
- You think...
- Hey! Hey! Hey!

1:12:47.764 --> 1:12:49.833
- I didn't grab you! No grabbing!
- None of us were there!

1:12:49.833 --> 1:12:51.601
None of us were there!
That's my fault!

1:12:51.601 --> 1:12:53.336
It's my fault, OK?

1:12:53.336 --> 1:12:55.204
And if you think it's right
to kill these people,

1:12:55.204 --> 1:12:58.041
then you should do it,
but I am ordering you not to.

1:12:59.042 --> 1:13:00.477
It's your choice.

1:13:01.478 --> 1:13:03.046
Captain Mora ordered us
down here, right?

1:13:03.046 --> 1:13:04.981
- Yes.
- Well, then, it's his call.

1:13:04.981 --> 1:13:07.951
And he doesn't give a damn
about us or anybody's life!

1:13:07.951 --> 1:13:10.687
Well, Mora ain't here, is he?
Ack's giving orders.

1:13:10.687 --> 1:13:13.823
Hey, weren't you the one
that said, "Stick close to Mora,

1:13:13.823 --> 1:13:16.726
"don't listen to Ack," because
Ack was gonna get us killed?

1:13:19.028 --> 1:13:20.396
Yeah, you know what?

1:13:20.396 --> 1:13:23.166
Topside, that's the right call.
You follow the vets.

1:13:23.166 --> 1:13:25.334
But it's just us down here.

1:13:25.334 --> 1:13:28.672
And like I said, you choose to
follow my orders or you won't.

1:13:31.007 --> 1:13:33.009
Do you want to do this, Daniel?

1:13:34.043 --> 1:13:36.045
Do you want to
kill these people?

1:13:40.750 --> 1:13:42.251
We're moving out.

1:13:46.723 --> 1:13:48.191
We're moving out.

1:13:57.200 --> 1:13:58.635
Go ahead.

1:14:38.341 --> 1:14:40.443
Fat fuck!

1:14:40.443 --> 1:14:41.845
Huh!

1:14:43.513 --> 1:14:45.782
- Sh...

1:14:56.593 --> 1:14:58.194
What the fuck was that?

1:14:59.462 --> 1:15:01.030
That was Crawford.

1:15:13.209 --> 1:15:15.078
Hey, what's the point
of the map, man?

1:15:15.078 --> 1:15:17.446
I mean, this is fucking chaos.

1:15:17.446 --> 1:15:19.949
- Do you know the way?
- I'm just saying.

1:15:19.949 --> 1:15:22.285
The map's only good for
the next person you give it to.

1:15:22.285 --> 1:15:23.620
It's so we don't keep going down

1:15:23.620 --> 1:15:25.088
the same tunnels
we done been down.

1:15:25.088 --> 1:15:26.623
Can you quit your bitching?

1:15:26.623 --> 1:15:28.992
- The fuck is that?

1:15:58.655 --> 1:16:00.056
Nevins?

1:16:06.663 --> 1:16:08.164
Nevins?

1:16:11.234 --> 1:16:12.836
Nevins's gone.

1:16:18.041 --> 1:16:21.010
Come on, baby.
Come on, Nevins. Come on.

1:16:23.479 --> 1:16:25.514
I'm not leaving him.
I'm not leaving him.

1:16:25.514 --> 1:16:27.050
- We have to.
- No, we don't.

1:16:27.050 --> 1:16:29.252
- You're hurt.
- We don't leave men behind.

1:16:29.252 --> 1:16:30.920
We don't leave men behind.

1:16:30.920 --> 1:16:35.324
Ack, we either take Gates
or we drag Nevins's corpse.

1:16:35.324 --> 1:16:36.693
We can't do both.

1:16:36.693 --> 1:16:38.327
Come on, man. Come on, man.

1:16:38.327 --> 1:16:40.764
You're strong, man.
I'm gonna get you out of here.

1:16:40.764 --> 1:16:42.098
We're leaving him.

1:16:42.098 --> 1:16:43.566
- No.
- We gotta leave him.

1:16:43.566 --> 1:16:45.835
- I'm gonna get you out of here.
- No, we gotta leave him.

1:16:45.835 --> 1:16:47.536
- No! No, we don't.
- We gotta leave him.

1:16:47.536 --> 1:16:48.905
- Gates!
- No, I can't!

1:16:48.905 --> 1:16:50.339
We gotta... we gotta leave him.

1:16:50.339 --> 1:16:52.041
- No, I can't!
- Gates, please!

1:16:52.041 --> 1:16:55.211
- No! No!
- Please! Please, man! Please!

1:16:55.211 --> 1:16:57.513
Stop!

1:16:57.513 --> 1:16:59.115
OK.

1:16:59.115 --> 1:17:02.051
- Move.
- Grab my fucking arm.

1:17:04.888 --> 1:17:07.123
Go right. Right.

1:17:07.123 --> 1:17:10.093
Fuck...

1:17:14.330 --> 1:17:16.599
- Sit. Sit.

1:17:16.599 --> 1:17:18.267
Fuck, fuck...

1:17:21.938 --> 1:17:23.907
I can't hear anything!

1:17:27.744 --> 1:17:30.880
Hey, that, uh... that grenade
came from up top, right?

1:17:30.880 --> 1:17:32.581
The ceiling had a hole in it.

1:17:32.581 --> 1:17:33.817
OK.

1:17:34.818 --> 1:17:36.585
So they're ventilation shafts.

1:17:36.585 --> 1:17:38.587
That means multiple layers.

1:17:38.587 --> 1:17:40.957
The smoke from here has
to be fed up and out somehow.

1:17:40.957 --> 1:17:43.159
How big is this fucking place?

1:17:45.028 --> 1:17:47.997
Hey, Gates, we'll find
a ventilation shaft

1:17:47.997 --> 1:17:50.099
big enough to put you in,
get you topside.

1:17:50.099 --> 1:17:51.868
What about the binder?

1:17:52.869 --> 1:17:54.537
Do you give a shit?

1:17:55.839 --> 1:17:57.807
Hell no.

1:17:57.807 --> 1:17:59.809
I'm not losing you guys.

1:18:06.282 --> 1:18:07.917
OK.

1:18:07.917 --> 1:18:10.653
- Come on.

1:18:10.653 --> 1:18:12.521
Good? Let's go.

1:18:31.540 --> 1:18:33.176
Oh, shit.

1:18:33.176 --> 1:18:35.311
Shit, I think
this is a dead end.

1:18:50.559 --> 1:18:52.428
We can't go
no further down.

1:18:53.429 --> 1:18:54.864
We gotta make a stand.

1:18:55.932 --> 1:18:58.701
He's right.
We fight our way out.

1:18:58.701 --> 1:19:00.503
- Fuck!

1:19:06.810 --> 1:19:08.111
No!

1:19:22.291 --> 1:19:23.426
Huh!

1:19:53.189 --> 1:19:54.824
- Oh!

1:20:03.132 --> 1:20:05.268
Oh, Gates.

1:20:05.268 --> 1:20:07.736
Hey! Hey, hey, hey.
You alright? Gates?

1:20:07.736 --> 1:20:10.339
Boyd, you're doing good.

1:20:11.340 --> 1:20:13.442
Don't listen to Nevins.
He's an idiot.

1:20:16.012 --> 1:20:18.882
Ack's a good leader. OK?

1:20:18.882 --> 1:20:23.186
Just tell... tell Gledhill
to do... do what he says.

1:20:36.032 --> 1:20:39.002
No! Boyd?!

1:20:39.002 --> 1:20:41.270
Yeah?

1:20:41.270 --> 1:20:43.039
He's gone.

1:20:44.040 --> 1:20:46.775
It's... it's just us.

1:20:48.144 --> 1:20:50.179
- I'm sorry.
- It's OK.

1:20:54.550 --> 1:20:58.287
We got... we got 30 minutes.

1:21:01.324 --> 1:21:03.092
What happens after that?

1:21:03.092 --> 1:21:06.029
I think Mora only cares about
the mission succeeding.

1:21:07.030 --> 1:21:10.866
Nothing else matters.
We... we don't matter.

1:21:12.635 --> 1:21:14.370
Is the mission over?

1:21:16.472 --> 1:21:17.974
I don't know.

1:21:20.809 --> 1:21:22.311
What do you wanna do?

1:21:24.380 --> 1:21:26.315
They died for that binder.

1:21:28.417 --> 1:21:31.820
If we finish, it's for them.

1:21:36.359 --> 1:21:39.895
20 minutes. OK?

1:21:40.896 --> 1:21:43.532
We don't find it,
we get out of here.

1:21:43.532 --> 1:21:45.434
OK.

1:21:46.702 --> 1:21:48.271
But for them.

1:21:49.272 --> 1:21:51.574
Not for Mora.

1:21:51.574 --> 1:21:53.076
OK.

1:21:54.077 --> 1:21:55.778
OK, for them.

1:21:59.115 --> 1:22:00.849
Where do we go now?

1:22:04.587 --> 1:22:06.055
Up.

1:22:15.731 --> 1:22:17.100
OK.

1:22:19.368 --> 1:22:21.204
Ready?

1:22:23.639 --> 1:22:27.243
Boyd, come on.

1:22:34.483 --> 1:22:35.951
Hold on.

1:22:42.992 --> 1:22:45.028
OK. We need to go that way.

1:22:45.028 --> 1:22:47.396
Um, you take point.

1:22:48.397 --> 1:22:50.566
- You sure?
- Yeah, you're faster anyway.

1:22:50.566 --> 1:22:52.601
I'll follow you.

1:22:52.601 --> 1:22:54.103
OK.

1:23:13.489 --> 1:23:15.091
You know where we are?

1:23:15.091 --> 1:23:17.260
Yeah, hold on.
I think so.

1:23:19.762 --> 1:23:20.963
Right or straight?

1:23:20.963 --> 1:23:22.998
Um, go straight.

1:23:22.998 --> 1:23:25.268
- Alright. OK.
- Yeah.

1:23:43.686 --> 1:23:45.121
Storage.

1:23:45.121 --> 1:23:48.457
Rockets and grenades.

1:23:48.457 --> 1:23:50.293
Good job.

1:23:51.294 --> 1:23:52.695
OK.

1:24:33.068 --> 1:24:34.737
Jackpot.

1:24:34.737 --> 1:24:36.505
- What? The binder?
- Yeah.

1:24:36.505 --> 1:24:38.674
- OK.
- OK.

1:24:40.376 --> 1:24:43.346
Um, let me think. OK.

1:24:43.346 --> 1:24:45.148
You turn around.

1:24:45.148 --> 1:24:48.551
We're gonna go back
through this way. Alright?

1:24:48.551 --> 1:24:51.220
- OK.
- Come on.

1:25:11.707 --> 1:25:14.042
Hey, Boyd, I'm, uh...

1:25:14.042 --> 1:25:15.378
- I think...
- Yeah?

1:25:15.378 --> 1:25:17.012
I'm out.
You got any other clips?

1:25:17.012 --> 1:25:18.747
- No. I'm out too.
- OK.

1:25:18.747 --> 1:25:21.350
We're gonna search the boxes
when we get in there.

1:25:23.986 --> 1:25:26.088
OK. Quiet.

1:25:31.560 --> 1:25:33.762
If we... if we can't
find something,

1:25:33.762 --> 1:25:35.664
we gotta grab an AK.

1:26:09.164 --> 1:26:11.099
Boyd, go and get the binder!

1:26:11.099 --> 1:26:13.336
Get the binder! The binder!

1:26:23.546 --> 1:26:26.114
Fuck. Hey, hey, hey.

1:26:27.816 --> 1:26:29.518
- Fuck.
- Oh!

1:26:29.518 --> 1:26:32.255
Come on.
Get up, get up, get up.

1:26:32.255 --> 1:26:35.458
Hey, Sam. Hey, hey, hey, hey!

1:26:35.458 --> 1:26:37.593
The binder? The binder?!

1:26:37.593 --> 1:26:39.695
Have you seen the binder?

1:26:39.695 --> 1:26:41.530
The binder? The binder?

1:26:41.530 --> 1:26:43.165
Have you seen it?

1:26:43.165 --> 1:26:45.801
Yes? Where? Here?

1:26:45.801 --> 1:26:48.704
Fuck! Here, here, here?

1:26:48.704 --> 1:26:51.440
Here? Here? Here?

1:26:51.440 --> 1:26:52.875
Here? Here?

1:26:52.875 --> 1:26:54.643
Here.

1:26:57.546 --> 1:26:59.782
Fuck.  OK.

1:26:59.782 --> 1:27:01.984
Fuck! Oh!

1:27:01.984 --> 1:27:03.586
Fuck!

1:27:06.989 --> 1:27:08.557
Fuck!

1:27:12.227 --> 1:27:14.397
Open. Please, please.

1:27:15.398 --> 1:27:18.901
Oh, fuck! Oh!

1:27:22.938 --> 1:27:24.707
- Ugh!

1:27:32.915 --> 1:27:34.182
Arggh!

1:27:38.387 --> 1:27:40.255
Ugh!

1:27:47.963 --> 1:27:49.632
Come on!

1:27:58.441 --> 1:28:00.943
This way. Come on.

1:28:00.943 --> 1:28:03.946
Boyd! Boyd, no!
Go that way! Go that way!

1:28:03.946 --> 1:28:06.549
Back! Back! Back away.

1:28:36.745 --> 1:28:38.246
Hey, hey, come on.

1:28:38.246 --> 1:28:40.248
Please, please,
I need a minute. My fucking leg.

1:28:40.248 --> 1:28:41.750
- We don't have a minute!
- OK, go.

1:28:41.750 --> 1:28:43.452
You just go and I'll
catch up with you.

1:28:43.452 --> 1:28:45.988
What? No.
We don't leave men behind.

1:28:45.988 --> 1:28:47.956
I left fucking
everyone behind, Boyd!

1:28:47.956 --> 1:28:49.758
They're all fucking dead
because of me!

1:28:49.758 --> 1:28:52.928
No. Those deaths aren't on you.

1:28:52.928 --> 1:28:56.064
These are Captain Mora's orders,

1:28:56.064 --> 1:28:58.801
from someone above him,
from someone above him!

1:28:59.935 --> 1:29:02.838
You always gave a shit.

1:29:04.106 --> 1:29:05.240
Ack!

1:29:08.343 --> 1:29:09.978
It's nearby. I was here last.

1:29:09.978 --> 1:29:11.847
I lost my... my torch.

1:29:11.847 --> 1:29:13.348
- Come on.
- OK.

1:29:18.787 --> 1:29:20.389
Hey!

1:29:24.527 --> 1:29:26.361
Arggh!

1:29:52.821 --> 1:29:54.056
Hey!

1:29:55.057 --> 1:29:56.792
- Get up.
- Go!

1:30:10.673 --> 1:30:12.475
Time's up.

1:30:15.478 --> 1:30:17.045
They're still down there.

1:30:18.046 --> 1:30:19.815
Is that a problem?

1:30:19.815 --> 1:30:23.418
We needed a failsafe.
Crawford took care of it.

1:30:24.453 --> 1:30:27.355
I've never known you
to turn a blind eye.

1:30:27.355 --> 1:30:29.391
Or fail.

1:30:30.693 --> 1:30:33.596
No, but not like this.

1:30:33.596 --> 1:30:36.098
Victory is measured
in body count.

1:30:38.066 --> 1:30:40.903
How do you count them
when they're buried?

1:30:40.903 --> 1:30:42.805
One by one.

1:30:44.973 --> 1:30:46.609
Hell of a war.

1:30:46.609 --> 1:30:48.744
Link up with Miller at the LZ.

1:30:48.744 --> 1:30:51.113
Confirm mission success.

1:30:51.113 --> 1:30:52.447
Yeah.

1:30:59.121 --> 1:31:00.956
It's just a war.

1:31:08.296 --> 1:31:11.700
Come on, Ack!
It's just right there.

1:31:30.619 --> 1:31:32.555
Identify yourself!

1:31:32.555 --> 1:31:34.890
- We're friendlies! Hold fire!
- Who is it?!

1:31:34.890 --> 1:31:38.393
It's Boyd and Ackerman!

1:31:38.393 --> 1:31:40.228
He's wounded. We need help.

1:31:40.228 --> 1:31:42.264
Come on.
Oh, you gotta stop eating, man.

1:31:43.566 --> 1:31:45.668
Can you see my hand?

1:31:53.208 --> 1:31:55.243
- Do you have the package?

1:31:55.243 --> 1:31:57.112
There. There.

1:32:01.383 --> 1:32:03.085
How'd you find us?

1:32:03.085 --> 1:32:04.820
His dogs.

1:32:08.356 --> 1:32:10.058
Cowboy, we good?

1:32:11.059 --> 1:32:12.728
Yes, sir.

1:32:17.866 --> 1:32:20.202
You won the hunt, son.

1:32:25.608 --> 1:32:27.375
Let's try this again.

1:32:36.084 --> 1:32:37.820
We've got it.

1:32:38.887 --> 1:32:42.024
Destroy it. Direct orders.

1:32:46.829 --> 1:32:48.396
Put the engineer on.

1:33:00.242 --> 1:33:02.044
General Drummond.

1:33:07.349 --> 1:33:09.517
This is Ackerman.

1:33:09.517 --> 1:33:11.920
You did good, kid.

1:33:13.255 --> 1:33:17.392
It seemed like it was, uh,
do or die after two hours, sir.

1:33:17.392 --> 1:33:20.228
We can't let that information
get into enemy hands.

1:33:21.463 --> 1:33:24.566
If you're overrun before
that Huey arrives,

1:33:24.566 --> 1:33:27.235
we're gonna have to start
this whole shit show over.

1:33:27.235 --> 1:33:30.238
Failure didn't seem
like an option, sir.

1:33:33.208 --> 1:33:35.210
This your first time
in combat, son?

1:33:36.211 --> 1:33:37.746
Yes.

1:33:37.746 --> 1:33:40.015
Well...

1:33:40.015 --> 1:33:43.418
...this is your one time
to speak to a general freely.

1:33:43.418 --> 1:33:45.587
What the...
What are you doing?!

1:33:46.588 --> 1:33:49.792
That is a general on the line.

1:33:49.792 --> 1:33:53.929
You will talk
and you will accept.

1:33:53.929 --> 1:33:57.465
I'm gonna let you go now.
Understand?

1:33:59.968 --> 1:34:02.570
I have to confirm that
they're burning the binder.

1:34:05.640 --> 1:34:08.977
My friends died
bringing that binder back.

1:34:10.412 --> 1:34:12.447
Is there no...

1:34:12.447 --> 1:34:14.649
...is there no record
of what they did here?

1:34:15.650 --> 1:34:18.220
Listen to me, son.

1:34:18.220 --> 1:34:20.756
Now, I didn't write this
and I'm not the first to say it.

1:34:22.257 --> 1:34:24.326
But a warrior's record

1:34:24.326 --> 1:34:26.394
is not written in books

1:34:26.394 --> 1:34:28.330
or decorated with medals.

1:34:29.798 --> 1:34:31.366
You and your men...

1:34:34.202 --> 1:34:36.304
...you're part
of something deeper now.

1:34:38.373 --> 1:34:40.342
Their blood is in the earth.

1:34:43.545 --> 1:34:45.280
They live forever.

1:34:52.821 --> 1:34:54.823
Out.

1:35:10.305 --> 1:35:12.307
Let it go.

1:35:12.307 --> 1:35:14.810
That's not what
you take from here.
