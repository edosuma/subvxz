01:29.264 --> 01:31.132
Okay. Okay.

01:33.202 --> 01:34.795
I hear you.

02:52.281 --> 02:53.478
<i>...quite severe storminess...</i>

02:53.513 --> 02:54.809
<i>...the beginning part</i>
<i>of the day.</i>

02:54.844 --> 02:57.416
<i>Clouds in the North Country,</i>
<i>partly cloudy...</i>

02:58.815 --> 03:00.617
<i>High pressure</i>
<i>coming down from Canada.</i>

03:00.652 --> 03:03.884
<i>...further south</i>
<i>over the next few days.</i>

03:03.919 --> 03:06.656
<i>Futurecast shows</i>
<i>clouds are hugging</i>
<i>the tops of the mountains</i>

03:06.691 --> 03:08.658
<i>for a while today, for sure.</i>

03:08.693 --> 03:10.660
<i>Stronger winds coming</i>
<i>through the afternoon.</i>

03:10.695 --> 03:12.893
<i>Low pressure from the North</i>
<i>also bringing rain.</i>

03:12.928 --> 03:15.764
<i>Possibly some snow</i>
<i>among the higher peaks.</i>

03:15.799 --> 03:18.998
<i>If you're doing anything</i>
<i>outdoors today, make sure</i>
<i>you bundle up for that.</i>

03:19.033 --> 03:20.868
<i>Temperatures</i>
<i>could drop below freezing,</i>

03:20.903 --> 03:23.574
<i>with a bit of a breeze,</i>
<i>which will make it</i>
<i>feel even colder.</i>

03:23.609 --> 03:25.279
<i>Overnight tonight, very cold.</i>

03:25.314 --> 03:27.479
<i>One of the coldest nights</i>
<i>we've seen for a while.</i>

03:27.514 --> 03:28.546
<i>And that possibility...</i>

03:40.021 --> 03:41.592
May need this one.

03:48.469 --> 03:50.469
Can't forget you guys.

05:18.119 --> 05:19.393
Ow!

05:21.892 --> 05:23.056
Yoo-hoo?

05:30.901 --> 05:32.703
Oh!

05:32.738 --> 05:34.969
Look who wants to come
and see you.
Look at my little baby.

05:35.004 --> 05:37.807
Little piece of... Ooh.

05:37.842 --> 05:39.006
I love this dog.

05:39.041 --> 05:40.909
I know.

05:40.944 --> 05:43.813
That face,
I can never get over it.

05:43.848 --> 05:46.046
-Look at you.

05:46.081 --> 05:48.653
You know,
I don't like you
going up there alone.

05:50.052 --> 05:53.724
Cell phone service
is so unreliable.

05:53.759 --> 05:54.956
Mmm.

05:54.991 --> 05:58.157
Well,
you can be my chaperone.
Oh!

05:58.192 --> 05:59.763
Can you be my chaperone?

05:59.798 --> 06:03.866
Thirty years of scrambling
up those trails daily.

06:03.901 --> 06:04.933
I'm done.

06:06.673 --> 06:08.970
Nope.
But not Pam Bales.

06:09.005 --> 06:10.103
Nope.

06:12.514 --> 06:15.812
Hey, Pam,
you seen the weather forecast?

06:17.013 --> 06:18.551
Don't go up there.

06:18.586 --> 06:21.081
You know what day it is.

06:24.757 --> 06:25.855
Yeah.

06:29.630 --> 06:31.465
Anyway,
it's cheaper than therapy.

06:31.500 --> 06:35.469
And the mountains
always listen
and never talk back.

06:40.036 --> 06:42.542
No holdin' back
on the cocoa.

06:42.577 --> 06:44.137
Cheap bastard.
Oh!

06:44.172 --> 06:46.777
How many ex-husbands
do you have again?

06:46.812 --> 06:48.009
Too many.

06:52.521 --> 06:53.850
Boom.

06:53.885 --> 06:54.983
Thank you.

06:56.591 --> 06:57.623
Uh, jacket?

07:02.124 --> 07:04.058
Watch the weather.
I will.

07:04.797 --> 07:05.928
Hey.

07:06.601 --> 07:07.864
Be safe.

07:07.899 --> 07:09.701

Yes.

I'm sorry, bud.

31:54.351 --> 31:57.319
Hey, listen.

31:57.354 --> 32:00.751
My name's Pam,
and I'm going to get you
out of here.

32:00.786 --> 32:02.324
Can you hear my voice?

32:03.789 --> 32:07.263
I'm gonna get you
down the mountain.
What's your name?

32:07.298 --> 32:09.034
John.
I'm gonna call you John.

32:09.069 --> 32:10.497
Can you hear my voice?

32:10.532 --> 32:12.598
I'm with search and rescue,
okay?

32:12.633 --> 32:16.041
Now, stay with me, John.
I'm gonna need
to undress you, okay?

32:18.375 --> 32:20.408
I'll get
your body temperature up.

32:22.445 --> 32:24.478
Jesus, you're dressed
for the beach.

33:37.421 --> 33:39.190
Going to put this hat on.

33:40.622 --> 33:44.525
I need you to stay with me.
We're going to get you
down the mountain.

33:44.560 --> 33:47.099
I'm gonna get you in a bag.
Okay?

35:44.878 --> 35:46.482
Look at me.

35:46.517 --> 35:49.254
We need to move, okay?

35:49.289 --> 35:52.752
If we don't get moving,
we're dead.

35:53.821 --> 35:55.194
You understand me?

35:55.724 --> 35:56.855
I can't.

36:00.861 --> 36:01.926
If we don't...

36:07.703 --> 36:09.241
I'm not leaving you.

36:10.706 --> 36:12.343
You hearing me?

36:12.378 --> 36:13.806
I'm not leaving you.

36:33.630 --> 36:34.893
Damn it, John.

36:38.668 --> 36:39.964
This way, John.

36:42.540 --> 36:44.738
Listen to me.
Are you on something?

36:44.773 --> 36:47.576
Are you drinking?
Drugs? Oxy?

36:48.777 --> 36:50.678
Are you tripping?
Are you on mushrooms?

36:50.713 --> 36:51.778
Come on, John.

36:52.583 --> 36:53.912
This way, John.

36:55.080 --> 36:57.289
Let's get down
the mountain.

37:06.091 --> 37:08.498
John,
put this hat on.

37:09.534 --> 37:10.698
John!

37:10.733 --> 37:12.436
Oh, now he can walk.

37:15.507 --> 37:16.539
Listen to me.

37:19.907 --> 37:23.447
Once again, hat on.
And follow me.

37:23.482 --> 37:24.547
John.

37:26.551 --> 37:29.321
Listen,
we're going that way.

37:29.356 --> 37:31.884
We need to get down, okay?

37:32.788 --> 37:33.820
Attaboy.

38:43.463 --> 38:44.660
John.

38:46.532 --> 38:47.696
John.

38:48.501 --> 38:51.161
I told you, I can't!

38:51.196 --> 38:52.767
No!

38:52.802 --> 38:53.999
John!

39:24.966 --> 39:26.471
John.

39:26.506 --> 39:27.604
Are you okay?

39:28.772 --> 39:29.903
Are you okay?

39:30.939 --> 39:33.544
Yeah?
I'm gonna get you out, okay?

39:33.579 --> 39:34.809
On the count of three.

39:36.681 --> 39:37.713
One...

39:38.815 --> 39:39.847
two...

39:40.685 --> 39:41.717
three.

39:52.499 --> 39:54.730
Don't touch it! Get off!

40:18.855 --> 40:20.888
No! No! Don't eat that.

40:22.056 --> 40:25.959
No, John, that'll just
dehydrate you more.

40:25.994 --> 40:27.631
No, trust me.

40:46.982 --> 40:47.781
Okay.

40:49.182 --> 40:51.556
Do you have anyone
waiting for you, John?

40:54.022 --> 40:55.626
Cat.

40:55.661 --> 40:58.794
Cat.
What's your cat's name?

40:59.995 --> 41:01.225
Cat.

41:01.260 --> 41:03.029
Oh, that's not
very original, John.

41:03.834 --> 41:05.966
I'm more of a dog person.

41:06.001 --> 41:09.805
Thank God, me too.
I hate cats.

41:11.336 --> 41:14.645
All right, time to go.
Get up.

41:17.210 --> 41:20.178
Get up, John.- 30.

41:20.213 --> 41:23.621
We need to get
below tree line
before dark.

41:42.708 --> 41:46.105
Night's gonna drop
about 20 degrees
when the sun goes down.

41:46.140 --> 41:47.205
You hear me?

41:51.849 --> 41:56.049
So, we do not want to
be up here
when that happens.

43:37.317 --> 43:39.317
Oh, God!

43:58.943 --> 44:00.404
Okay there?
Fine.

44:12.451 --> 44:14.187
Oh, shit.

44:15.520 --> 44:18.796
I'm-- Pam, I'm done.

44:19.832 --> 44:22.162
I can't... I can't...

44:22.197 --> 44:24.065
I know. I know.

44:35.782 --> 44:36.946
Stand up.

44:46.386 --> 44:47.858
Come on.

44:47.893 --> 44:50.322
Fuck off! Fuck off!
And leave me alone.

44:51.424 --> 44:54.095
Nope, I can't.

44:56.429 --> 44:57.967
Let's go.
Go away.

45:01.533 --> 45:03.467
Go away, please.

45:03.502 --> 45:05.436
Let's go, bud.

45:13.281 --> 45:16.018
Well, look on the bright side.

45:16.889 --> 45:18.350
I mean, the frostbite...

45:21.124 --> 45:22.486
you can't feel it.

45:33.070 --> 45:35.433
I know. This sucks.

45:36.139 --> 45:37.303
This sucks, all right.

45:38.339 --> 45:40.306
Put your arms around me.

45:43.344 --> 45:45.113
Oh, my fucking ankle.

45:45.148 --> 45:46.543
I know.

45:46.578 --> 45:48.182
Put your arms
around my neck.

46:05.498 --> 46:08.004
I'm going to
look at you.

46:08.039 --> 46:10.501
There you go.
You okay?

46:14.980 --> 46:16.078
That's it.

46:25.089 --> 46:27.386
Okay, this'll help.

46:30.325 --> 46:32.259
Here you go.
Take some of these.

46:34.494 --> 46:36.901
First,
I'm going to get you warm.

46:39.070 --> 46:40.267
Here you go.

46:43.305 --> 46:46.944
This will help for the pain.
Small piece of chocolate.

46:46.979 --> 46:48.209
It's good for energy.

46:55.383 --> 46:57.251
Shit, there we go.

47:03.963 --> 47:04.995
I know.

47:11.564 --> 47:13.938
I can't. I can't.

47:13.973 --> 47:16.567
Don't worry,
you can trust me.
I'm a nurse.

47:19.176 --> 47:20.208
Here you go.

47:22.014 --> 47:28.117
It's my last pair,
so, no funny business
from here on out.

47:28.152 --> 47:29.184
You hear me?

47:29.989 --> 47:31.120
There you go.

47:44.498 --> 47:45.596
There you go.

47:46.698 --> 47:47.939
Whoo!

47:50.471 --> 47:53.670
Do you belong
to this... Pemige--

47:53.705 --> 47:56.343
Pemigewasset
Search and Rescue.

47:56.378 --> 47:59.214
Yeah, that's me. Pam Bales.

48:01.581 --> 48:03.350
You guys have a helicopter?

48:03.385 --> 48:06.089
What, heli--
No, sir.

48:06.124 --> 48:08.091
Just me.

48:08.126 --> 48:10.995
No cell phone service
until we get to
the parking lot either.

48:12.031 --> 48:14.097
No backup either?

48:14.132 --> 48:16.198
Nope,
just you and me.

48:17.531 --> 48:18.662
Shit.

48:20.303 --> 48:21.434
Shit.

48:23.636 --> 48:26.472
We're not--
We're not going to make it.

48:28.344 --> 48:30.641
We're not going to make it.

48:30.676 --> 48:33.413
We're-- We're going to die.

48:47.627 --> 48:50.430
I wanna-- I wanna go home.

48:54.337 --> 48:56.975
Save the tears.
Not now.

49:03.478 --> 49:07.117
We're gonna get you
down that mountain
before dark.

49:14.324 --> 49:17.754
Goddamn it. Oh, Pam.

49:18.526 --> 49:20.592
Oh.

50:40.179 --> 50:42.674
Come on, bud.
You can't sleep now.

51:12.409 --> 51:15.278
Can you hear the river?

51:15.313 --> 51:16.873
You're getting closer now.

51:17.678 --> 51:19.513
Okay.

51:22.518 --> 51:23.682
Let's get down here.

51:25.224 --> 51:28.555
You can do it, John.
Watch me.

51:28.590 --> 51:30.458
Just go on your belly.

51:35.366 --> 51:36.497
Grab on.

51:42.208 --> 51:43.768
Watch out.

51:47.543 --> 51:48.806
Okay.

51:54.814 --> 51:55.879
Easy.

52:11.798 --> 52:13.633
Yeah, okay.

52:13.668 --> 52:15.305
Go, John.

52:23.414 --> 52:25.711
Don't you fucking fall in,
John.

52:31.290 --> 52:32.421
Oh, God.

53:14.630 --> 53:15.992
Oh, God.

53:59.477 --> 54:00.707
John?

54:04.911 --> 54:06.284
John?

54:21.895 --> 54:22.960
John?

54:26.603 --> 54:27.734
John?

54:32.477 --> 54:34.103
John.

54:34.138 --> 54:35.643
Oh, goddamn it.

54:40.485 --> 54:43.046
Goddamn it.

55:19.821 --> 55:22.360
Oh, God. There you are.

55:24.023 --> 55:26.595
I got you, John.
I got you.

55:27.961 --> 55:29.125
You okay?

55:29.160 --> 55:33.569
Bud, hey.
I'm right here, John.

55:34.671 --> 55:35.703
Okay.

55:48.487 --> 55:49.618
I got you.

55:59.696 --> 56:02.158
You okay, John? You okay?

56:02.193 --> 56:05.601
Can you hear my voice?
Yes? You with me?
All right.

56:05.636 --> 56:07.867
Okay.
I need you to open your eyes.

56:07.902 --> 56:10.441
Look into my light.
I need to see your eyeballs.

56:10.476 --> 56:13.004
Yes. Oh, yeah. Okay.

56:13.039 --> 56:16.172
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.

56:20.684 --> 56:23.487
Let's get you
out of the water fully.

56:23.522 --> 56:26.655
Okay, okay, okay, yeah.
Okay, bud.

56:32.256 --> 56:34.091
Okay. I'm sorry, bud.

56:36.832 --> 56:37.930
Easy does it.

56:37.965 --> 56:39.195
Oh, God.

56:39.230 --> 56:42.473
You okay? I gotcha.

56:42.508 --> 56:44.068
Okay,
I'm going to need you to...

56:44.103 --> 56:48.105
Where are we?
...move a few more feet
out of this water.

56:48.140 --> 56:51.009
Or you're going to freeze
your goddamn balls off.

56:53.750 --> 56:57.147
Goddamn it!
You are such an asshole!

56:57.182 --> 56:58.786
I want...

56:58.821 --> 57:02.119
I told you it was slippery,
did I not? Did I not?

57:03.287 --> 57:04.825
Get over here.
Don't do that.

57:04.860 --> 57:06.222
Okay.
Stop doing that.

57:06.257 --> 57:08.191
Okay, I'm sorry.
Or I'll hit you back.

57:08.226 --> 57:10.864
Okay.
All right, all right.

57:10.899 --> 57:14.802
You can hit me back.
You can hit me back
if you have to.

57:18.137 --> 57:19.939
You scared the bejesus
out of me.

57:19.974 --> 57:21.039
I'm sorry.

57:23.714 --> 57:25.945
I was pretty scared too.

57:25.980 --> 57:29.014
You're such
a fuckin' asshole.

57:29.049 --> 57:31.753
One, two, three.

57:31.788 --> 57:34.525
Okay. Okay, you're good?

57:34.560 --> 57:35.625
Yeah.
You good?

57:35.660 --> 57:37.187
Yeah, I'm good.
Okay.

57:37.222 --> 57:39.189
I mean--
Try not to be a jackass,
okay?

57:39.224 --> 57:40.960
I'll try my best.
Anymore.

57:40.995 --> 57:43.930
You've got more lives in you
than your stupid cat.

57:43.965 --> 57:46.295
Okay, we're going to need
to head this way.

57:46.330 --> 57:50.101
You see that down there, John?
That's home.

57:53.007 --> 57:55.975
Let's go home, John.
Come on.

57:56.010 --> 57:59.077
You're good.
You're good, that's it.
Thank you.

57:59.112 --> 58:02.179
Look at that. Home.
Let's go.

58:02.214 --> 58:04.049
Now, you know any songs?

58:04.084 --> 58:07.822
No. I can't sing.
Oh, come on,
you must know one.

58:07.857 --> 58:10.022
Trust me,
you don't want to
hear me sing.

58:10.057 --> 58:11.089
Okay, John.

58:11.927 --> 58:14.092
Come on, anything.

58:14.127 --> 58:17.997

Okay. Okay, bud.

1:01:42.038 --> 1:01:46.436

It's getting cold.

Hey! Hey!
Hey. Hey.

1:02:03.554 --> 1:02:05.554
Hey. Hey!
Oh, God.

1:02:05.589 --> 1:02:06.995
Stop!

1:02:07.030 --> 1:02:08.491
Wait!
Please!

John.

1:03:26.241 --> 1:03:27.405
Come on.

1:03:38.121 --> 1:03:39.483
We found the road, bud.

1:03:42.026 --> 1:03:43.454
Get up.

1:03:43.489 --> 1:03:45.324
This is the last time.

1:03:52.432 --> 1:03:54.432
You okay?
You okay, bud?

1:03:56.337 --> 1:04:00.141
We're here.
We're good.

1:04:00.176 --> 1:04:02.110
We made it.
You see?

1:04:06.545 --> 1:04:09.018
Okay. Okay, let's go.

1:04:09.053 --> 1:04:10.987
Let's get--
get you to the car.

1:04:18.194 --> 1:04:19.963
Okay. Okay.

1:04:21.164 --> 1:04:22.196
Okay.

1:04:26.235 --> 1:04:27.267
Okay, here.

1:04:27.302 --> 1:04:29.170
Just wait right here, okay?

1:04:32.109 --> 1:04:33.108
You okay, bud?

1:04:34.078 --> 1:04:36.078
Look at me.
You hear my voice?

1:04:37.444 --> 1:04:41.083
Okay, good.
Just give me a sec.

1:04:41.118 --> 1:04:43.580
Okay, I'll get you warm.

1:04:43.615 --> 1:04:44.988
I'll turn the car on.

1:04:49.225 --> 1:04:51.456
Oh, shit, it's the other one.

1:04:51.491 --> 1:04:52.523
Okay.

1:04:55.693 --> 1:04:57.528
Okay, here. Here.

1:05:15.416 --> 1:05:17.515
You okay? Hey, John.

1:05:19.024 --> 1:05:20.716
John. Get in.

1:05:27.296 --> 1:05:28.559
John?

1:05:28.594 --> 1:05:30.363
Oh, shit.

1:05:36.602 --> 1:05:37.634
John?

1:05:39.077 --> 1:05:40.109
Hey!

1:05:40.672 --> 1:05:43.310
John, what are you doing?

Wait,
what's going on, bud?

1:05:54.752 --> 1:05:55.993
John!

1:05:56.622 --> 1:05:59.623
Hey! Hey! John!

<i> News.</i>

1:15:44.781 --> 1:15:46.242
<i>An update from the amazing</i>
<i>story from Mount Washington,</i>
<i>New Hampshire.</i>

1:15:46.277 --> 1:15:48.376
<i>Pam Bales has been identified</i>
<i>as the lone woman</i>

1:15:48.411 --> 1:15:51.280
<i>who tracked</i>
<i>and saved a young man</i>
<i>close to death from exposure</i>

1:15:51.315 --> 1:15:53.656
<i>on the Westside Trail</i>
<i>in a heavy snowstorm.</i>

1:15:53.691 --> 1:15:55.823
<i>The man, who has asked</i>
<i>to remain anonymous,</i>

1:15:55.858 --> 1:15:58.958
<i>informed the police</i>
<i>of the woman's daring attempt</i>
<i>to rescue him</i>

1:15:58.993 --> 1:16:02.830
<i>and praised her bravery</i>
<i>in bringing him down off</i>
<i>the mountain all on her own.</i>

1:16:02.865 --> 1:16:05.129
<i>From details the man gave</i>
<i>from the badge on her jacket,</i>

1:16:05.164 --> 1:16:08.066
<i>we were able to identify</i>

<i>from the extreme cold.</i>

1:16:15.944 --> 1:16:18.648
<i>He'd given up, but against</i>

1:16:18.683 --> 1:16:20.045
<i>Pam Bales refused to give up</i>

1:16:20.080 --> 1:16:22.718

1:18:16.163 --> 1:18:18.196
<i>Yeah, got your message.</i>

1:18:18.231 --> 1:18:22.134
<i>Uh, sorry, no.</i>
<i>He left no phone number,</i>
<i>no address.</i>

1:18:22.169 --> 1:18:24.004
<i>Not even his name.</i>

1:18:24.039 --> 1:18:28.041
<i>Just some story about looking</i>

1:18:28.076 --> 1:18:30.109
<i>Sorry. Bye.</i>

1:19:29.500 --> 1:19:31.599
Hi. Pam Bales.

1:19:31.634 --> 1:19:35.207
Uh...
...you just missed her.

1:19:35.242 --> 1:19:36.879
Oh.

1:19:37.409 --> 1:19:38.441
Damn.

1:19:40.247 --> 1:19:42.577
Well...

1:19:42.612 --> 1:19:46.889
I could swear the woman
I've seen on the news
was looking a lot like you.

1:19:48.420 --> 1:19:50.453
If you see her, Pam...

1:19:53.425 --> 1:19:55.865
Maybe you can ask her
to contact me.

1:19:58.397 --> 1:19:59.561
If you see her.

1:20:04.205 --> 1:20:06.436
Hey, uh...

1:20:06.471 --> 1:20:10.077
I think there are
a lot of people that
want to just say thanks.

1:20:19.055 --> 1:20:20.087
For you.

1:20:22.289 --> 1:20:23.321
Thanks.

1:20:36.435 --> 1:20:41.405
Right, so...
have you heard from him? John?

1:20:42.276 --> 1:20:43.473
Not a word.

1:20:45.180 --> 1:20:46.674
Hmm.

1:20:46.709 --> 1:20:49.347
And what do you think
he was doing?

1:20:50.515 --> 1:20:52.515
Doing? What...

1:20:52.550 --> 1:20:56.552
Up there? In November.
Dressed like that.

1:20:59.359 --> 1:21:01.095
Why does it matter?

1:21:02.362 --> 1:21:04.395
Because I'm gonna
try to find him.

1:21:05.596 --> 1:21:06.903
Why?

1:21:08.038 --> 1:21:10.038
You were up there for hours.

1:21:10.634 --> 1:21:12.139
You saved this man's life.

1:21:13.373 --> 1:21:15.241
Maybe he wants to
tell you something.

1:21:17.047 --> 1:21:19.443
If he wanted to do that,
he would have done it.

1:21:21.447 --> 1:21:22.611
Maybe.

1:21:24.252 --> 1:21:26.516
But there's only one way
to find out.

1:23:19.598 --> 1:23:20.630
I, um...

1:23:26.176 --> 1:23:28.407
The jacket and the pants.

1:23:29.608 --> 1:23:32.576
Threw the socks out.
Didn't think you'd mind.

1:23:34.250 --> 1:23:35.082
I don't.

1:23:38.617 --> 1:23:41.486
Dave will be happy
to have his jacket back.

1:23:49.298 --> 1:23:52.431
I don't even know
what to call you.

1:23:53.302 --> 1:23:56.204
John is fine.
John is good.

1:23:58.274 --> 1:23:59.405
Okay.

1:24:03.741 --> 1:24:05.213
How's your ankle?

1:24:06.711 --> 1:24:08.117
Getting better.

1:24:09.186 --> 1:24:11.417
Ten toes?
Ten fingers?

1:24:28.733 --> 1:24:34.440
I can't see her face anymore.

1:24:40.547 --> 1:24:42.316
That's what's so surprising.

1:24:45.222 --> 1:24:47.255
I never expected to...

1:24:48.621 --> 1:24:50.852
forget a face so easily.

1:24:54.363 --> 1:24:58.596
Uh, I know every detail,
but I--

1:25:00.237 --> 1:25:01.830
I can't see it.

1:25:03.867 --> 1:25:08.276
Like,
I know she had little lines
when she smiled.

1:25:11.578 --> 1:25:15.514
A birthmark on her cheek
that you could only see
when it was cold.

1:25:26.725 --> 1:25:28.329
And where did she go?

1:25:34.700 --> 1:25:36.502
What does it mean...

1:25:38.440 --> 1:25:40.209
to-- to die?

1:25:45.645 --> 1:25:47.414
That was a year ago.

1:25:50.683 --> 1:25:54.949
When you found me,
I'd gone back up there
to look for her.

1:25:56.854 --> 1:25:59.360
I almost stopped
looking for her.

1:26:01.694 --> 1:26:05.861
Then I realized
I didn't need to look.

1:26:06.831 --> 1:26:09.799
I could just wait
and she would come.

1:26:13.442 --> 1:26:17.543
So I sat down
and I closed my eyes...

1:26:20.383 --> 1:26:23.450
and I waited for her
to speak to me.

1:26:29.887 --> 1:26:32.987
But you spoke to me instead.

1:26:42.801 --> 1:26:43.833
Thank you.

1:26:48.543 --> 1:26:49.905
See-- Mmm.

1:26:52.008 --> 1:26:56.714
There was a gas leak
in my building
a long time ago.

1:27:00.753 --> 1:27:05.558
I slept in the living room
on the couch
with the window cracked,

1:27:06.627 --> 1:27:08.759
I woke up and...

1:27:10.026 --> 1:27:11.861
I-- I couldn't stand.

1:27:13.436 --> 1:27:15.799
And I see it every day
in my head.

1:27:17.407 --> 1:27:18.637
I remember...

1:27:22.709 --> 1:27:25.875
I remember
the paint on the walls...

1:27:27.879 --> 1:27:32.915
the, uh, feeling of the carpet
on my hands and knees.

1:27:35.084 --> 1:27:39.724
And I was crawling
to my little girls' room,

1:27:39.759 --> 1:27:44.531
saying,
"I'm coming. I'll save you."

1:27:48.537 --> 1:27:50.867
But I didn't. I couldn't.

1:27:55.775 --> 1:27:57.610
They were five and six.

1:27:59.548 --> 1:28:03.649
And I wanted to die
just like you.

1:28:08.458 --> 1:28:11.558
Does it get easier?

1:28:15.025 --> 1:28:20.831
Even in the storm,
even in the pain
and the wind...

1:28:23.869 --> 1:28:25.935
there is so much beauty.

1:28:31.580 --> 1:28:37.452
The whole universe
appears as
an infinite storm of beauty.
