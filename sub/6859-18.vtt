Supreme
Chancellor in peril!

00:19.719 --> 00:23.163
After surviving the ordeals
of The Box, Obi-Wan Kenobi--

00:23.232 --> 00:27.063
working undercover as assassin
Rako Hardeen--is invited to join

00:27.131 --> 00:30.062
Count Dooku's plot against
Chancellor Palpatine.

00:30.131 --> 00:33.761
Working with a team of deadly
bounty hunters, Obi-Wan travels

00:33.797 --> 00:36.600
to the planet of Naboo
where the Chancellor will

00:36.636 --> 00:38.608
preside over the Festival of Light.

00:38.643 --> 00:41.176
Now as the Jedi Council
and Count Dooku finalize

00:41.244 --> 00:46.051
their respective plans, a deadly
confrontation seems inevitable.

00:46.087 --> 00:48.355
As you can see, we've mapped
the Chancellor's route

00:48.390 --> 00:49.891
to and from the festival stage.

00:49.926 --> 00:53.620
We know where he'll be at every moment
from the time we land on Naboo.

00:53.740 --> 00:55.842
What security measures are in place?

00:56.102 --> 00:58.967
The Naboo royal guard will
have armed sentries at

00:59.036 --> 01:00.501
all entry points on the palace.

01:00.536 --> 01:02.970
And the stage itself will be
sealed off by a ray shield

01:03.038 --> 01:04.837
for the duration of the event.

01:04.906 --> 01:06.839
I see nothing here to worry about.

01:06.908 --> 01:09.540
With complacency comes vulnerability.

01:09.576 --> 01:11.008
Yes.

01:11.077 --> 01:14.177
It is what we do not
see that concerns me.

01:14.245 --> 01:18.349
A long time to plan his
attack Count Dooku has.

01:18.418 --> 01:19.550
Yes.

01:19.585 --> 01:21.554
We thought we'd have an
advantage with Obi-Wan

01:21.589 --> 01:25.326
on the inside, but we've had no
communication from him in days.

01:25.361 --> 01:27.161
Obi-Wan will do his part.

01:27.196 --> 01:29.797
Let's make sure we do ours.

01:54.855 --> 01:55.620
Ah!

Thud!

01:59.025 --> 02:00.960
Torti ito dee day.

02:02.864 --> 02:03.629
Ahh!

02:05.033 --> 02:06.532
Shh!

02:12.406 --> 02:14.039
Ah!

02:15.642 --> 02:16.608
Blahh!

02:16.677 --> 02:17.609
Oh!

02:21.248 --> 02:21.880
Ah!

02:21.916 --> 02:23.516
Well, hello there.

02:24.486 --> 02:25.418
Oh!

02:31.160 --> 02:33.293
All clear.

02:42.837 --> 02:46.939
This is it, my friends, the day
of reckoning for the Republic.

02:46.975 --> 02:50.309
I have it from a very reliable
source that everything will

02:50.344 --> 02:52.644
happen exactly as we planned.

02:52.680 --> 02:55.481
Execute your roles as
you've been instructed,

02:55.517 --> 02:58.951
and you will all be immortalized
in history, not to mention

02:59.020 --> 03:00.786
rewarded with enough credits

03:00.855 --> 03:03.656
that you will never have to work again.

03:03.691 --> 03:07.828
I will let Cad Bane take it from here.

03:07.864 --> 03:08.829
Listen up.

03:08.865 --> 03:10.831
I'm only saying it once.

03:10.867 --> 03:15.003
Each device tells you your
position and essential details

03:15.038 --> 03:17.105
about your part of the plot.

03:17.140 --> 03:20.108
Aren't you gonna tell us how
all the pieces fit together?

03:20.143 --> 03:23.312
Derrown here is going
to breach the shield.

03:23.381 --> 03:26.015
Moralo Eval is the getaway driver.

03:26.050 --> 03:30.019
Two of you will act as guards
protecting the Chancellor.

03:30.055 --> 03:32.137
And you, Hardeen...

03:35.011 --> 03:36.555
Are the sniper.

03:38.363 --> 03:40.396
That's all you need to know.

03:40.432 --> 03:42.031
Once we have the Chancellor,

03:42.100 --> 03:45.202
the devices will lead you
to the rendezvous point.

03:45.270 --> 03:47.204
Any questions?

03:47.273 --> 03:49.206
Now for our disguises.

03:49.275 --> 03:51.909
Everyone step back.

03:51.944 --> 03:54.211
This will get us into the inner circle.

03:54.280 --> 03:56.747
Step into the shadow hologram,
and you will receive

03:56.782 --> 03:58.081
your new identity.

04:07.224 --> 04:09.525
When you leave here, you'll
have no communication

04:09.561 --> 04:11.861
with the rest of the team.

04:11.896 --> 04:12.828
All right, then.

04:12.897 --> 04:15.998
Get to your positions.

04:16.067 --> 04:17.200
Well handled.

04:17.235 --> 04:20.202
I should have put you
in charge long ago.

04:20.238 --> 04:22.538
A word of advice, though.

04:22.574 --> 04:25.075
Keep an eye on Hardeen.

04:25.110 --> 04:28.912
There's something about
him I do not trust.

04:28.948 --> 04:30.080
Don't worry.

04:30.116 --> 04:33.718
I'm keeping my eye on all of them.

05:08.522 --> 05:10.823
Greetings, Your Majesty.

05:10.892 --> 05:12.525
Welcome home, Chancellor.

05:12.560 --> 05:15.427
I'm thankful to the Jedi for
bringing you here safely.

05:15.463 --> 05:16.895
Yes, senator.

05:16.964 --> 05:18.597
It is good to be back.

05:18.633 --> 05:19.899
Although I think the amount of

05:19.967 --> 05:23.602
security that has accompanied
me is overkill.

05:23.637 --> 05:26.605
With all due respect,
Chancellor, where your safety

05:26.640 --> 05:31.410
is concerned, there is no
such thing as overkill.

05:31.445 --> 05:32.578
So you keep insisting,

05:32.613 --> 05:36.202
Master Jedi, but I've grown
tired of discussing it.

05:37.952 --> 05:41.754
Anakin, Ahsoka, welcome to the Festival.

05:41.790 --> 05:44.057
I've never seen the Festival of Light.

05:44.125 --> 05:45.592
Sounds like a big event.

05:45.627 --> 05:48.161
They're expecting a
large crowd, which means

05:48.196 --> 05:51.164
it will be difficult for Dooku
to attack during the ceremony.

05:51.200 --> 05:54.134
That leaves the palace as the
best opportunity for an ambush.

05:54.169 --> 05:56.970
Are you that certain
an attack is imminent?

05:57.006 --> 05:58.305
I'm afraid so.

05:58.340 --> 06:00.974
Which is why I'm making Ahsoka
your personal bodyguard.

06:01.043 --> 06:03.310
At your service, My Lady.

06:03.345 --> 06:04.511
If there's trouble, Ahsoka

06:04.547 --> 06:07.681
will get you, the Queen, and the
rest of your staff to safety.

06:07.717 --> 06:08.682
What about you?

06:08.718 --> 06:11.151
Hopefully, I'll be where I always am.

06:11.220 --> 06:12.853
He means saving the day.

06:12.888 --> 06:15.021
Of course he does.

06:44.592 --> 06:46.120
Make sure you have two guards posted.

06:47.157 --> 06:48.290
Excuse me.

06:49.959 --> 06:52.927
Obi-Wan, thank goodness you're alive.

06:52.996 --> 06:55.535
Yes, I've seen better days.

06:55.655 --> 06:57.004
I'm here in Theed.

06:58.289 --> 07:00.201
So Dooku's plan is still on?

07:00.236 --> 07:01.035
Yes.

07:01.070 --> 07:03.538
How are they planning
to attack the Chancellor?

07:03.573 --> 07:06.373
Three of the bounty hunters
are disguised as senate guards.

07:06.409 --> 07:08.842
Eval is the getaway driver, and
they have a Parwan that can

07:08.911 --> 07:10.377
pass through the ray shield.

07:10.413 --> 07:11.946
I have a sniper rifle.

07:12.015 --> 07:12.947
Don't worry.

07:13.015 --> 07:14.915
It's loaded with stun blasts.

07:14.950 --> 07:17.918
I'm supposed to immobilize the
Chancellor, not kill him.

07:17.954 --> 07:19.086
Where are you?

07:19.121 --> 07:21.988
In a tower overlooking the Plaza.

07:22.023 --> 07:24.124
So the attack is going
to take place outside.

07:24.192 --> 07:24.991
Yes.

07:25.027 --> 07:27.155
From here, I can be your eye in the sky.

07:27.275 --> 07:30.796
I'll be able to tell you
everything that's going on.

07:30.831 --> 07:32.797
They will try to infiltrate
the security area.

07:32.833 --> 07:35.467
Make sure you have someone
double-check the guards' identities.

07:35.536 --> 07:37.736
That's gonna take time.

07:37.772 --> 07:39.438
You'll have to do your best, my friend.

08:09.538 --> 08:11.006
The stage is set.

08:11.041 --> 08:12.808
Activate the ray shield.

08:12.876 --> 08:14.442
Copy that, General Skywalker.

08:39.383 --> 08:42.751
It is an honor to be
here for this momentous occasion.

08:42.787 --> 08:47.490
The pride I feel for this planet
cannot be put into words.

08:47.558 --> 08:52.395
847 years ago, Naboo
joined the Republic.

08:52.431 --> 08:56.400
And tonight, we celebrate that union.

09:09.948 --> 09:12.383
What's your identification number?

09:12.418 --> 09:14.551
SG-1984.

09:14.586 --> 09:16.553
All right, move along.

09:16.588 --> 09:18.388
But stay sharp.

09:19.758 --> 09:23.193
Take a moment and look around
this glorious city of yours.

09:23.262 --> 09:27.564
It wasn't long ago this
was all plasma mines.

09:27.599 --> 09:31.100
Naboo has indeed come a long way.

09:31.136 --> 09:37.540
But as we chart a bold course for the
future, let us never forget our past.

09:50.322 --> 09:52.457
Mace, so far so good.

09:55.161 --> 09:55.994
Gotcha!

09:56.029 --> 09:57.462
East side!

09:57.530 --> 09:59.330
The security guard on the stairs.

09:59.365 --> 10:03.000
Skywalker, the shield generator.

10:06.872 --> 10:07.504
Ooh!

10:12.144 --> 10:14.910
All right, you two, take
the Chancellor to that

10:14.946 --> 10:17.880
speeder and get him out of here!

10:17.915 --> 10:19.081
This way, Your Majesty.

10:19.116 --> 10:20.205
Hurry!

10:40.670 --> 10:41.302
Ah!

10:42.005 --> 10:42.604
Blast!

10:42.672 --> 10:43.605
It's only good for one shot.

10:45.975 --> 10:49.510
Mace, Anakin's down, and I
don't see Bane anywhere.

10:49.578 --> 10:50.877
I'll find him.

10:52.915 --> 10:55.048
Let's make the switch.

10:55.084 --> 10:57.051
Evo compren Chancellor.

11:02.992 --> 11:05.127
A ley.

11:11.603 --> 11:15.672
You're coming with me, Chancellor.

11:19.345 --> 11:21.244
Those tentacles pack quite a punch.

11:21.280 --> 11:23.881
Come on.

11:23.949 --> 11:25.048
The Chancellor!

11:25.084 --> 11:28.599
The guard escorting them
is a bounty hunter!

11:32.991 --> 11:35.592
Ha necha.

11:38.531 --> 11:40.499
Chancellor, are you all right?

11:42.703 --> 11:44.303
Ah!

11:46.875 --> 11:48.642
Where is the Chancellor?

11:50.479 --> 11:51.278
Move it!

11:51.313 --> 11:53.581
Move it!

11:59.055 --> 12:01.688
So long, Jedi.

12:10.029 --> 12:11.663
I'm going after the Chancellor.

12:11.731 --> 12:13.131
Copy that, Obi-Wan.

12:13.166 --> 12:14.098
I'll send you the coordinates

12:14.134 --> 12:17.635
and hold Bane there as long as I can.

12:23.209 --> 12:25.644
This is the rendezvous point.

12:25.713 --> 12:30.183
Dooku said he would meet us here.

12:30.219 --> 12:31.485
Hmm.

12:31.554 --> 12:33.354
What did I tell you, Bane?

12:33.389 --> 12:36.491
My plan worked to perfection.

12:36.559 --> 12:38.826
It wasn't your plan.

12:38.895 --> 12:41.829
It was my execution of your plan.

12:41.898 --> 12:42.663
Come on.

12:42.732 --> 12:43.531
Get up.

12:43.566 --> 12:47.001
How dare you disrespect Moralo Eval!

12:47.070 --> 12:48.369
Pipe down.

12:48.404 --> 12:49.537
Where is Dooku?

12:49.572 --> 12:51.839
I thought you said he'd meet us here.

12:51.908 --> 12:52.707
That was the plan.

12:57.846 --> 13:00.448
Hardeen, you're not
supposed to be here yet.

13:00.483 --> 13:03.718
I don't want to be double-crossed
and left behind again.

13:03.754 --> 13:06.722
I think we've all been double-crossed.

13:06.757 --> 13:08.190
Dooku's a no-show.

13:08.259 --> 13:09.191
What do you mean?

13:09.260 --> 13:11.260
What do we do with the Chancellor now?

13:11.295 --> 13:14.096
We'll ransom him ourselves.

13:14.165 --> 13:17.833
If Dooku won't pay us,
somebody else will.

13:17.902 --> 13:21.869
I'm afraid the Chancellor
is coming with me.

13:24.907 --> 13:25.706
Ah!

13:40.155 --> 13:42.088
Ah!

13:57.371 --> 13:58.338
Ah!

13:58.373 --> 13:59.339
Please!

13:59.374 --> 14:01.974
Do not kill Moralo Eval!

14:02.043 --> 14:04.677
Take him and Bane into
custody, and make sure

14:04.713 --> 14:08.982
the Chancellor is returned
safely to the palace.

14:09.050 --> 14:12.685
You did a good job, Obi-Wan.

14:12.721 --> 14:14.687
Kenobi!

14:14.723 --> 14:16.856
I should have known.

14:16.891 --> 14:20.860
Something smelled wrong
about you from the start.

14:20.896 --> 14:21.694
Yes.

14:21.763 --> 14:25.432
Well, spending so much time
with you was no reward either.

14:25.467 --> 14:26.599
Reward!

14:26.635 --> 14:31.404
I'll give you a reward, when I
plug you full of laser bolts!

14:31.440 --> 14:33.607
Such a pleasant fellow.

14:33.642 --> 14:35.409
I hope this was all worth it.

14:35.478 --> 14:36.944
We saved the Chancellor.

14:36.979 --> 14:39.113
That's the important thing.

14:55.896 --> 14:58.030
Once again, you have all
distinguished yourselves

14:58.066 --> 15:02.968
in the eyes of the Republic, and the
people of Naboo are in your debt.

15:03.003 --> 15:04.982
It's all part of the job, My Lady.

15:10.343 --> 15:12.944
I'm not sure I agree with
your orders to send the rest

15:12.979 --> 15:15.146
of the security detail
back to Coruscant.

15:15.182 --> 15:17.143
Now that the threat has passed,

15:17.263 --> 15:20.882
I think Anakin is all the security I need.

15:22.155 --> 15:23.488
You look terrible.

15:24.857 --> 15:26.957
Being a criminal is not easy work.

15:27.026 --> 15:29.827
If I'd known what was going
on, I could have helped you.

15:29.862 --> 15:32.830
Too bad the Council didn't trust me.

15:32.865 --> 15:36.833
Anakin, it was my decision
to keep the truth from you.

15:36.869 --> 15:40.007
I knew if you were convinced I was
dead, Dooku would believe it as well.

15:41.040 --> 15:42.907
Your decision?

15:42.942 --> 15:47.578
Look, I know I did some questionable
things, but I did what I had to do.

15:47.614 --> 15:49.547
I hope you can understand that.

15:49.582 --> 15:50.681
You lied to me!

15:50.750 --> 15:54.485
How many other lies have I
been told by the Council?

15:54.553 --> 15:58.022
And how do you know that you
even have the whole truth?

16:10.170 --> 16:12.638
We should get you into the
transformation chamber.

16:12.673 --> 16:15.940
Everyone's a little tired of looking
at that ugly face of yours.

16:16.009 --> 16:18.810
This is the face that
saved the Republic.

16:18.845 --> 16:20.478
But I think you're right.

16:20.513 --> 16:23.113
It's time to go back to
being Obi-Wan Kenobi.

16:23.182 --> 16:26.021
I can sense something
is still bothering you.

16:26.852 --> 16:28.118
Yes.

16:28.187 --> 16:31.288
Something Anakin said has me worried.

16:31.356 --> 16:33.184
Do we know the whole truth?

16:34.693 --> 16:36.460
I think I'll stay.

16:36.528 --> 16:38.784
I need to check one last thing.

17:18.635 --> 17:19.401
Dooku was listening.

17:19.470 --> 17:21.670
He knew all along.

17:21.705 --> 17:25.007
We will leave as soon as Queen
Neeyutnee's banquet is over.

17:25.042 --> 17:27.643
I also want to say good-bye
to senator Amidala.

17:27.712 --> 17:29.960
She has been a very gracious host.

17:30.220 --> 17:31.180
Hmm.

17:31.216 --> 17:33.383
Padme didn't mention a banquet to me.

17:33.418 --> 17:36.119
Perhaps she meant it as a surprise.

17:37.021 --> 17:41.024
I must say, the lengths the Jedi will
go to is nothing short of incredible.

17:41.060 --> 17:46.663
I assume the brilliant plan to
disguise Obi-Wan Kenobi was yours.

17:46.732 --> 17:47.531
No.

17:47.566 --> 17:48.665
It wasn't, Sir.

17:48.734 --> 17:50.634
I was in the dark as much as you were.

17:50.669 --> 17:52.102
Really?

17:52.170 --> 17:53.102
Interesting.

17:53.171 --> 17:57.107
I was under the impression the
Jedi always worked as a team.

17:58.677 --> 17:59.909
Welcome.

18:03.481 --> 18:06.282
My gracious, it's a trap!

18:06.350 --> 18:07.983
Chancellor, stay back!

18:12.523 --> 18:17.626
You should have quit while
you were still alive, Dooku.

18:17.661 --> 18:21.630
Fighting off the entire Jedi
security force would have been

18:21.665 --> 18:24.525
difficult, but now that they are gone...

18:26.169 --> 18:29.370
Defeating you alone
will be an easy task.

18:43.921 --> 18:45.221
Whoosh!

18:47.792 --> 18:48.725
Chancellor!

18:48.794 --> 18:50.427
Get out of here!

18:50.462 --> 18:53.063
Good idea.

18:56.135 --> 18:58.902
Unhand me!

19:07.878 --> 19:09.845
Whoosh!

19:17.055 --> 19:19.022
Whoosh!

19:34.706 --> 19:36.674
Whoosh!

19:55.692 --> 19:56.324
Uh!

20:05.567 --> 20:07.501
Whoosh!

20:16.946 --> 20:18.747
Are you all right?

20:18.783 --> 20:20.750
Come on!

20:40.672 --> 20:43.473
Well done, Master Kenobi.

20:43.509 --> 20:45.475
You are a worthy adversary.

20:45.544 --> 20:49.112
I cannot say the same about
your young apprentice.

20:56.254 --> 20:57.888
Chancellor!

20:57.924 --> 20:59.557
Are you all right?

20:59.592 --> 21:00.725
Yes.

21:00.760 --> 21:03.408
Thanks again to the heroics of the Jedi.

21:03.930 --> 21:06.164
That's the second time today.

21:06.199 --> 21:08.934
We specialize in heroics, Chancellor.

21:09.002 --> 21:13.372
As long as I live, no harm will
ever come to you, Your Excellency.

21:13.441 --> 21:19.111
Hmm, well, here's to your long
and prosperous life, Anakin.

21:19.179 --> 21:23.538
One shudders to think where the
galaxy would be without the Jedi.
