00:14.806 --> 00:17.183
Hey, FloJo,
can you slow down a second?

00:18.727 --> 00:23.314
You know, this could be why I'm one of
<i>Manhattan Magazine's </i>50 most eligible men,

00:23.398 --> 00:25.066
and you're not.

00:25.150 --> 00:28.111
It's amazing how many times that comes up
in a mile and a half.

00:29.112 --> 00:32.323
Are you coming to the event tonight?
I'm not the only homo on the list.

00:32.407 --> 00:34.993
You could snag
an eligible single of your own.

00:35.076 --> 00:36.619
Is Stanley gonna be there?

00:37.328 --> 00:38.163
No.

00:39.205 --> 00:40.832
It's Friday.

00:40.915 --> 00:44.002
He's got his table for one somewhere.
Remember?

00:44.502 --> 00:48.339
PS, if I ever start taking myself out
to hot new restaurants on Friday nights

00:48.423 --> 00:51.134
and posting pics of my lonely Negroni,

00:51.217 --> 00:53.219
please reintroduce me to my dick.

00:53.303 --> 00:54.179
Hah. Deal.

00:54.262 --> 00:56.431
-And, just asking…

00:56.514 --> 00:59.642
…when is this teen girl nonsense
between you two going to end?

00:59.726 --> 01:03.271
What? It's not nonsense.
He fucking betrayed me.

01:03.354 --> 01:06.274
W-- Would you have gone
to a dinner party at Colin's

01:06.357 --> 01:08.193
the week after he kicked me to the curb?

01:08.276 --> 01:09.110
-No!
-Well--

01:09.194 --> 01:11.738
But only partly out of loyalty to you.

01:12.405 --> 01:14.032
Your boy was a little dull.

01:14.657 --> 01:16.576
-Bam!
-Seriously? You always thought that?

01:16.659 --> 01:17.786
Oh no. We are not doing that.

01:17.869 --> 01:19.370
-Just make sure you come tonight.
-Wha--

01:19.454 --> 01:22.165
I'll try. I've got a busy workday
and lunch with my mom.

01:22.248 --> 01:24.375
I'm gonna finally tell her
that Colin left.

01:24.876 --> 01:25.752
-Oh, damn.

01:25.835 --> 01:27.378
Doesn't she love Colin?

01:27.462 --> 01:30.673
Yeah, for his looks and his money.
She's deep that way.

01:31.341 --> 01:33.885
Hundred bucks says
she was at that dinner party.

01:35.887 --> 01:37.639
Wait, wait, wait…

01:51.027 --> 01:53.738
Whew! That salad was overrated, right?

01:53.822 --> 01:54.781
Eh…

01:54.864 --> 01:59.786
It's crazy. <i>The Times </i>gushes,
like the chef reinvented the Nicoise,

01:59.869 --> 02:03.289
everybody trips over themselves
to go try it, and then it's like,

02:03.790 --> 02:08.461
"It was fine! It's a tuna salad.
People, take a chill pill."

02:08.962 --> 02:11.840
"Chill pill?" Mom, don't say chill pill.
That's not okay.

02:11.923 --> 02:17.554
Chillax, honey. I didn't mean
to offend your super hip ears.

02:18.471 --> 02:20.181
What is going on with you?

02:20.265 --> 02:24.310
All day, you've either been monosyllabic
or kind of a bitch.

02:25.687 --> 02:26.646
Did I do something?

02:26.729 --> 02:28.565
No, I'm sorry. It's not you. I just…

02:28.648 --> 02:31.985
I have something big to tell you,
and it's harder than I thought.

02:34.946 --> 02:35.947
Colin left.

02:36.573 --> 02:37.407
Left where?

02:37.490 --> 02:38.449
Left me.

02:38.533 --> 02:39.784
He walked out,

02:39.868 --> 02:42.620
took all his shit,
and dumped me in a text.

02:42.704 --> 02:45.123
No. No, this can't be.

02:45.206 --> 02:48.001
No, you seemed so in love
at the birthday party.

02:48.084 --> 02:49.294
What did you do?

02:50.044 --> 02:50.879
Did you cheat?

02:50.962 --> 02:52.338
Uh-- Of course not!

02:52.422 --> 02:54.632
This makes no sense! Think back.

02:54.716 --> 02:57.635
Did you do something to push him away?

02:57.719 --> 03:00.805
No. Jesus, believe me, I keep
asking myself the same question,

03:00.889 --> 03:03.349
but it'd be nice if it wasn't
the first thing my mother went to.

03:03.433 --> 03:04.350
-My--

03:04.434 --> 03:06.978
-Okay, Mom, you don't have to get hyster--

03:07.061 --> 03:09.981
-Michael! Down here!
-Mom?

03:10.940 --> 03:12.400
Oh my God. Are you okay?

03:12.483 --> 03:13.484
I'm alive!

03:14.527 --> 03:17.322
But I'm very disappointed in you!

03:18.281 --> 03:19.115
I…

03:23.786 --> 03:28.041
-The hospital just sent her home?
-Yeah. She's banged up, but she's okay.

03:28.124 --> 03:30.335
Dad's there.
I'll check in on her a bit later.

03:31.085 --> 03:35.173
The kitchen has a breakfast nook
and a walk-in pantry, so…

03:37.217 --> 03:38.551
-Oh!

03:38.635 --> 03:39.636
Oh my God.

03:39.719 --> 03:41.054
She's back early.

03:41.763 --> 03:44.974
Careful. You scuff a wall,
you're telling Claire.

03:45.058 --> 03:47.477
I'd like to keep my balls,
thank you very much.

03:47.560 --> 03:49.312
Stanley! Wow!

03:50.480 --> 03:52.899
-Nice surprise.
-Yes, for all of us, huh?

03:54.067 --> 03:55.068
Hello, Michael.

03:55.652 --> 03:56.486
Hi.

03:57.904 --> 04:00.949
Claire bought a piece
at the Sayre Gomez show,

04:01.032 --> 04:03.368
and I wanted
to supervise the installation.

04:05.036 --> 04:06.204
Whatever you need to do.

04:09.165 --> 04:10.833
He's just hurting, you know.

04:10.917 --> 04:13.628
I do, but come on, we're almost 50.

04:13.711 --> 04:16.673
Girl, didn't I go to your 50th,
like, two years ago?

04:16.756 --> 04:19.759
Shut up, Suzanne. Everybody shaves.

04:20.426 --> 04:22.804
I'd like to get a peek
at your driver's license sometime.

04:22.887 --> 04:24.097
Ooh!

04:24.180 --> 04:25.431
-Ooh!

04:37.944 --> 04:41.406
Okay, we've been friends for 20 years.

04:41.489 --> 04:43.283
I know you're going through a lot,

04:43.366 --> 04:45.451
but are we seriously
not even going to talk?

04:45.535 --> 04:46.452
Yes.

04:46.536 --> 04:49.622
When you betray people,
they often don't wanna talk to you.

04:49.706 --> 04:51.040
Okay, come on.

04:51.124 --> 04:53.251
"Betray" is a pretty dramatic word.

04:53.334 --> 04:55.837
-Can you even let me ex--
-Ah-- I'm in the middle of a showing.

05:04.137 --> 05:06.055
It's super perfume-y in here.

05:08.933 --> 05:10.101
I'm so sorry.

05:10.184 --> 05:12.353
No, no. it's great. I'll call you back.

05:12.437 --> 05:14.063
We just got an offer.

05:14.147 --> 05:15.148
-Really?
-Yes!

05:15.231 --> 05:16.816
-From who? Whom? Wait.

05:16.899 --> 05:19.569
It doesn't matter!
Someone from last week's open house.

05:19.652 --> 05:22.739
It's a smidge under asking,
but I bet we can get Claire on board.

05:22.822 --> 05:24.741
-You think? Oh my God.
-Yes!

05:24.824 --> 05:26.701
-I need this. I'm so excited!

05:26.784 --> 05:29.370
-Me too! I'm all tingly down there.
-Oh-ho!

05:33.708 --> 05:36.169
You see that text?
She says she's coming up the block.

05:36.252 --> 05:38.379
-Oh God, I hope she takes this offer.
-Yeah.

05:38.463 --> 05:41.591
Second notice on the liquor bill
for Colin's party.

05:41.674 --> 05:44.635
Based on this, everyone there
should've died of alcohol poisoning.

05:44.719 --> 05:46.637
He should really
help you out with that.

05:46.721 --> 05:48.431
Tell him you need some cash.

05:48.514 --> 05:50.224
Oh, believe me, I'd love to,

05:50.308 --> 05:53.644
but how could I ask him for money
without sounding like a pathetic loser?

05:53.728 --> 05:56.647
Like this. "Bitch, you wanna leave?
The price is half your shit."

05:58.399 --> 06:00.276
-Hey.
-God!

06:00.360 --> 06:03.613
Why are you jumping up at me like that
the second I walk in the door?

06:03.696 --> 06:06.532
It gives me flashbacks
to when I had to raise my children.

06:06.616 --> 06:13.081
Sorry. We're just all worked up
because we got a great offer.

06:13.164 --> 06:14.457
-Oh!

06:14.540 --> 06:16.292
-It's a bit under asking, but--
-No.

06:16.959 --> 06:17.794
No?

06:17.877 --> 06:20.296
I am not taking less than asking

06:20.380 --> 06:25.009
just so my cradle-robbing ex-husband
can jump-start his bloated new life.

06:25.093 --> 06:27.553
Yes, he's fatter now.

06:27.637 --> 06:30.681
Who knew that he could shack up
with his Pilates instructor

06:30.765 --> 06:32.683
and somehow end up
with an even bigger ass?

06:32.767 --> 06:33.976
-But--
-Me. I knew.

06:34.060 --> 06:35.770
Listen.

06:35.853 --> 06:41.234
I hear you, but we've had dozens
of showings, and this is the only bite.

06:41.317 --> 06:44.946
And our asking price
might actually be a little high

06:45.029 --> 06:47.198
for the comps in this neighborhood.

06:47.281 --> 06:49.367
That is all gobbledygook to me.

06:51.411 --> 06:55.873
There have been a lot of showings, Claire,
and this is the only offer we've gotten.

06:55.957 --> 06:58.876
A comp in the building
did sell at this price.

06:58.960 --> 07:02.130
Okay. I get what you're saying.

07:02.213 --> 07:04.841
But I don't want
to upend my whole life here

07:04.924 --> 07:07.718
when the right buyer may come along later.

07:07.802 --> 07:10.179
I mean, I have time.

07:10.680 --> 07:12.014
Where am I even going?

07:12.098 --> 07:15.226
Actually, um… you have a good point.

07:15.309 --> 07:17.812
Is it possible
you might be holding on to your old life

07:17.895 --> 07:20.022
because it's hard to picture a new one?

07:20.106 --> 07:23.276
What if we showed you some apartments

07:23.359 --> 07:29.073
and gave you an idea of how great
your life would be once this is all over?

07:29.157 --> 07:31.784
It could help you let go emotionally.

07:32.368 --> 07:35.079
Do we have this kind of relationship?

07:35.163 --> 07:36.205
I get it, though.

07:36.289 --> 07:38.791
Like, with Colin,
when I think ahead to Christmas,

07:38.875 --> 07:41.252
I dread doing it without him.

07:41.335 --> 07:45.381
But then I remember Colin only
let us have white lights on our tree.

07:45.465 --> 07:49.218
So this year,
I am doing colors, which I like.

07:49.927 --> 07:54.098
Point being, when I let myself
imagine a fun life without him,

07:54.974 --> 07:56.559
I do feel better.

07:57.435 --> 07:59.645
Yeah, that makes sense.

07:59.729 --> 08:04.358
Okay, so I say
we give you a fresh new start.

08:04.442 --> 08:07.862
Somewhere totally different
with no bad memories.

08:08.905 --> 08:10.781
What about downtown?

08:10.865 --> 08:14.202
Downtown is for restaurants.
Not for living.

08:14.285 --> 08:17.622
Come on, Claire, change it up.

08:17.705 --> 08:24.629
I could totally see you in a sexy loft,
downtown, living your best life.

08:24.712 --> 08:26.714
And wouldn't it be nice
to walk to the corner

08:26.797 --> 08:31.177
and not be reminded of places you went
with your morbidly obese ex-husband?

08:33.012 --> 08:35.181
You do make it sound fun.

08:35.890 --> 08:38.684
You know, there's a place
I think you will love.

08:39.977 --> 08:42.063
And I bet we could get in this afternoon.

08:42.146 --> 08:43.064
Oh.

08:43.147 --> 08:46.150
Yes. I think I can make that work.
I'm free at 5:00.

08:46.234 --> 08:47.652
Great.

08:48.361 --> 08:49.320
-Let's order.
-Yes.

08:49.403 --> 08:52.031
Oh, I'm not eating here.
The food is terrible.

09:00.623 --> 09:01.791
Hey, it's me!

09:01.874 --> 09:03.209
In my room, honey!

09:03.709 --> 09:04.919
What, Mike?

09:05.002 --> 09:08.130
-Uh, stop in the kitchen first!
-Uh, I wanna check in on Mom.

09:08.214 --> 09:10.633
Uh, no, wait. Mike. Mikey!

09:13.803 --> 09:16.681
I, uh, think your dad
was trying to warn you that I'm here.

09:17.431 --> 09:19.725
-Makes sense. Hi.
-Hi.

09:20.351 --> 09:21.852
Uh… Sorry, Colin.

09:21.936 --> 09:25.439
It's just that we only learned today
what's going on with you two.

09:26.566 --> 09:30.695
So, Mom, did you tell Colin that you fell
so that he would come over?

09:30.778 --> 09:33.281
No, he came over on his own, thank you.

09:33.364 --> 09:35.783
I'm still on the family text thread.
I read it there.

09:36.534 --> 09:39.203
And saw a pretty appetizing picture
of your lunch salads.

09:39.287 --> 09:40.871
Oh, they were fine.

09:40.955 --> 09:43.249
I just wanted to make sure
that your mom was okay.

09:43.332 --> 09:47.003
Which I really appreciate.
Such a lovely gesture, coming over here.

09:49.714 --> 09:52.508
FYI, you know,
Ben and I took some time off once

09:52.592 --> 09:54.302
when he was sleeping with his secretary.

09:55.052 --> 09:56.304
-I was not--
-Mom.

09:56.387 --> 09:59.932
Please stop saying that.
I just wanted space.

10:00.016 --> 10:02.143
Yes, space between another woman's legs.

10:03.185 --> 10:05.062
It's fine. We're fine now!

10:05.146 --> 10:08.441
I mean, these things happen,
and you never think about them again.

10:09.025 --> 10:10.109
What--

10:10.192 --> 10:11.694
All right. Well, I should go.

10:11.777 --> 10:12.653
Um…

10:12.737 --> 10:14.405
I'm glad you're feeling okay, Lisa.

10:17.825 --> 10:20.620
-Nice to see you, Michael.
-Yeah, you too. Maybe.

10:20.703 --> 10:21.579
I'm not sure yet.

10:21.662 --> 10:23.456
-Don't be a stranger.
-See you soon!

10:23.539 --> 10:26.083
"You too, maybe?" What is wrong with you?

10:26.167 --> 10:28.961
-I don't--
-Clearly, he still cares about you.

10:29.045 --> 10:32.548
-Go after him, fix this!
-He never even told me why he left.

10:32.632 --> 10:35.343
You're not gonna find out in here,
knucklehead. Go!

10:37.511 --> 10:39.180
Colin? Hey. Hey!

10:39.680 --> 10:40.598
I just, um… Hi.

10:40.681 --> 10:44.143
I just wanted to, uh, say sorry
for the dumb goodbye.

10:44.226 --> 10:45.102
-It's, uh--

10:45.186 --> 10:47.813
-I still don't know how to act yet.
-I get it. Me either.

10:47.897 --> 10:50.316
Oh. That's weirdly comforting.

10:51.233 --> 10:53.402
Thanks for checking in on Mom.
That was sweet of you.

10:53.486 --> 10:56.447
Oh, of course.
I spent 17 years with your family.

10:57.323 --> 10:59.033
I care about them. That won't change.

10:59.116 --> 11:01.911
I won't forget one of the five women
who've seen me naked.

11:01.994 --> 11:03.496
-Oh my God.

11:03.579 --> 11:07.333
In that creepy house
that my sister rented on the Jersey Shore.

11:07.416 --> 11:09.168
I get shivers thinking about your mother

11:09.251 --> 11:11.212
accidentally walking in on me
in the shower.

11:11.295 --> 11:14.131
Accidentally, my ass!
She knew you were in there.

11:16.300 --> 11:19.470
So how's work? I hear
the market's pretty strong these days.

11:19.553 --> 11:20.429
Yeah, sure.

11:21.138 --> 11:21.972
Kinda.

11:22.640 --> 11:23.474
Kinda?

11:24.183 --> 11:25.267
You need anything?

11:27.019 --> 11:28.020
Um…

11:30.523 --> 11:31.607
No, I'm good.

11:32.400 --> 11:34.068
I think I have a big sale comin' up, so…

11:34.151 --> 11:36.987
Oh, that's great. I'm not worried.
You're the best.

11:40.116 --> 11:41.409
All right, I really gotta go.

11:41.992 --> 11:44.912
Dog's been locked away for hours now.

11:44.995 --> 11:46.288
Do-- dog?

11:46.956 --> 11:48.999
You're joking. You got a dog?

11:49.083 --> 11:52.002
Can we please end
on the nice moment we just had?

11:52.086 --> 11:56.716
Uh, if you want a nice moment,
don't tell me that you just got a dog

11:56.799 --> 12:01.554
when I always wanted us to have a dog,
and you said you never ever wanted a dog.

12:01.637 --> 12:05.975
Did you get an Eames lounge chair now too,
or is that still a tired gay cliché?

12:06.058 --> 12:06.934
What about cilantro?

12:07.017 --> 12:08.644
-Suddenly delicious?
-No matter what I say,

12:08.728 --> 12:10.187
you always have the biggest feelings.

12:10.271 --> 12:13.858
Was that it? My feelings were too big?
I still don't know what happened with us.

12:13.941 --> 12:15.526
-I'm not doing this now.
-You're not--

12:15.609 --> 12:17.278
-And I'm not gonna be yelled at.
-Wh--

12:17.361 --> 12:20.489
I'm not yelling! I'm confused!

12:20.573 --> 12:22.950
This is my very confused voice!

12:24.577 --> 12:27.455
And the Eames chair is a classic!

12:33.794 --> 12:36.756
-Hey, sorry to be so late.
-It's cool. Claire's upstairs.

12:36.839 --> 12:39.341
She asked
for some time alone in the loft.

12:39.425 --> 12:42.803
Either she really can't stand me,
or she's poopin'.

12:43.763 --> 12:46.474
What's wrong?
You love a snooty lady pooping joke.

12:46.557 --> 12:49.810
Sorry, I ran into Colin at my mother's.
He got a dog.

12:50.352 --> 12:51.771
-What? After you--
-Yeah.

12:51.854 --> 12:52.980
-And he kept sayin'--
-Uh-huh.

12:53.063 --> 12:54.690
Oh, I'm officially out of the fan club.

12:54.774 --> 12:58.402
I don't hate it.
Can't argue with the views.

12:58.486 --> 13:01.989
It has a sexy feel that I would have loved
when I was young and gorgeous.

13:02.072 --> 13:03.657
-Stop. You're gorgeous.
-You're gorgeous.

13:03.741 --> 13:05.284
I mean gorgeous to men.

13:05.367 --> 13:06.827
-You know what I mean.

13:06.911 --> 13:10.956
Divorced, middle-aged lady moves
to downtown in a feeble attempt to be hip?

13:11.040 --> 13:13.417
That's what people
are going to be saying.

13:13.501 --> 13:16.212
No, they won't. And why don't we
continue this conversation

13:16.295 --> 13:18.881
at a party
for Manhattan's most eligible men?

13:18.964 --> 13:22.009
-It's just up the block.
-Oh… Can I go home and change first?

13:22.092 --> 13:22.968
-No.
-No.

13:31.185 --> 13:32.853
-Thank you.
-One second.

13:36.273 --> 13:37.441
They're small.

13:37.525 --> 13:38.943
-So small.
-No judgment.

13:39.610 --> 13:40.444
Oh! There's Billy.

13:40.528 --> 13:42.571
-I'm gonna go tell him that we're here.
-Mm-mm!

13:42.655 --> 13:44.281
No, no. No. Wh--

13:44.365 --> 13:47.535
So this is your plan
to get me to accept the offer?

13:47.618 --> 13:48.452
Mm…

13:48.536 --> 13:50.496
Hook me up with some eligible bachelor,

13:50.579 --> 13:52.748
show me that there's life
after being left.

13:52.832 --> 13:55.209
We just want you to have a good time,
feel some hope.

13:55.292 --> 13:58.504
And, come on, we've read the books,
we've heard the songs.

13:58.587 --> 14:00.673
You don't need a man
to move on with your life.

14:00.756 --> 14:05.135
Good thing. They're not exactly lining up
for a divorced mother of a certain age.

14:05.219 --> 14:06.345
I heard that.

14:06.428 --> 14:10.558
I mean, there is a line, but it's a little
more urgent care than velvet rope.

14:11.058 --> 14:12.935
Wait, you have children?

14:13.519 --> 14:15.688
That's so odd. I picture you alone.

14:15.771 --> 14:19.233
Well, not sad alone, but independent.

14:20.192 --> 14:21.986
Thank you for clarifying.

14:22.069 --> 14:25.364
Uh, and I do have a son, yeah.
Kai. He's 25.

14:26.365 --> 14:27.199
Husband?

14:27.700 --> 14:29.535
Never married. I--

14:29.618 --> 14:31.912
I took a summer off
to backpack through Europe,

14:31.996 --> 14:33.914
and… had a lot of fun.

14:34.623 --> 14:36.250
Like a <i>lot </i>a lot.

14:36.333 --> 14:37.418
Meaning?

14:39.753 --> 14:44.550
Kai's dad is one of three men
that I had no idea how to find in 1997.

14:45.968 --> 14:47.428
My God!

14:48.220 --> 14:50.890
Your life is that horrendous ABBA movie.

14:50.973 --> 14:53.142
Except my life has Black people in it.

14:54.476 --> 14:55.769
-Oh!

14:55.853 --> 14:57.229
-You got it.

14:57.313 --> 14:59.106
That's much better. Thank you!

15:01.400 --> 15:02.526
-Hey!
-Oh, hey!

15:02.610 --> 15:04.236
-Hey!

15:04.320 --> 15:06.655
Yo, my people, this is Michael.

15:06.739 --> 15:07.823
-Hey.
-Hi, hi.

15:07.907 --> 15:09.533
My best friend of many years.

15:09.617 --> 15:13.954
He's newly eligible himself,
and any of you would be lucky to have him.

15:14.038 --> 15:15.331
Trust me. I've had him.

15:15.414 --> 15:17.750
Years ago, when we were children.

15:17.833 --> 15:19.501
Like everyone Billy dates now.

15:19.585 --> 15:22.254
-Ah!
-You didn't tell me he was cute and funny.

15:22.338 --> 15:26.634
Oh! Dive right in, okay.
Michael, this is Alex.

15:26.717 --> 15:28.677
He's on the eligible men's list too.

15:28.761 --> 15:30.971
Oh, cool. Congratulations.

15:31.055 --> 15:35.267
Alex has a big podcast
about climate change from an LGBTQ angle.

15:35.351 --> 15:37.853
It's called <i>Emissions Control.</i>

15:38.604 --> 15:39.688
How funny is that?

15:39.772 --> 15:41.649
Ah, yeah, that is funny.

15:42.191 --> 15:44.234
So why are you newly eligible?

15:44.318 --> 15:46.820
My partner dumped me on his 50th birthday

15:46.904 --> 15:49.406
at a surprise party I'm still paying off.

15:49.490 --> 15:50.908
Damn. Are you serious?

15:50.991 --> 15:52.952
Sorry for eavesdropping.
That sounds rough.

15:53.035 --> 15:56.372
It was. But we don't wanna
talk about that right now, do we?

15:56.455 --> 15:58.165
I ran into him today, by the way,

15:58.248 --> 16:01.919
and, um, found out
that he bought himself a dog.

16:02.002 --> 16:03.337
-Oh.
-Can you fucking believe that?

16:03.420 --> 16:05.547
I always wanted a dog, but he refused.

16:05.631 --> 16:08.801
Now that he's single, he is all about
rushing home to walk a stupid dog.

16:08.884 --> 16:10.469
-Jesus.
-That's so cold.

16:10.552 --> 16:12.596
We're really doing this?

16:12.680 --> 16:14.264
You know,

16:15.140 --> 16:19.979
Pierce Brosnan once hit on me
in the first-class lounge at Heathrow.

16:20.062 --> 16:22.815
But I've been faithful
for some goddamn reason.

16:22.898 --> 16:24.900
Oh, you shoulda hit that.

16:24.984 --> 16:26.860
Trust me, I pictured it more than once

16:26.944 --> 16:30.322
while Jabba the Husband
was squirming around on top of me.

16:30.406 --> 16:31.699
Oh my God!

16:33.158 --> 16:34.827
-Oh!
-You know…

16:35.995 --> 16:38.664
-This is fun.
-Mm! This is fun.

16:39.248 --> 16:40.082
You're fun.

16:41.083 --> 16:43.293
I have to say,
I thought you didn't like me.

16:43.794 --> 16:48.257
No. I'm just chilly
with people who work for me.

16:48.340 --> 16:51.093
-Ah.
-And also with family and friends.

16:53.053 --> 16:57.683
And Stanley kept the whole dinner party
a secret, which is such a huge betrayal!

16:57.766 --> 17:00.394
-Huge!
-Sorry, that's awful.

17:00.477 --> 17:03.188
Thank you. It means a lot
that you guys get it.

17:03.272 --> 17:04.440
Yeah, of course.

17:04.523 --> 17:07.234
But don't worry, you're cute.
You have a good job. You'll do fine.

17:07.317 --> 17:08.610
You know what you need?

17:08.694 --> 17:10.946
To get out of your head
and into your body,

17:11.030 --> 17:14.450
possibly with a not crazy,
STD-free couple on PrEP.

17:16.118 --> 17:17.327
Did you say couple?

17:17.953 --> 17:19.872
I thought you were an eligible man.

17:19.955 --> 17:22.666
No, no, Luis and I
have been together for years.

17:22.750 --> 17:24.918
But single's better for the brand.

17:25.002 --> 17:27.379
He doesn't care,
and we get to be single together.

17:27.463 --> 17:28.422
So what do you say?

17:28.505 --> 17:30.966
Maybe Alex and I
licking your wounds for a night

17:31.050 --> 17:32.968
could turn that frown upside down?

17:33.052 --> 17:34.762
-Yeah. We don't want you to be sad.

17:36.889 --> 17:38.390
Wait. Are you offering me

17:39.016 --> 17:40.768
a pity three-way?

17:40.851 --> 17:45.731
-Well, we feel bad for you.
-So, yes, Okay, um… pass.

17:45.814 --> 17:48.192
I'm not really feeling
a charity fuck tonight,

17:48.275 --> 17:52.863
but, um, good luck, and, um,
thanks, I guess?

17:55.115 --> 17:58.118
You know, I was at that party
where they broke up.

17:58.202 --> 17:59.703
Just awful.

18:00.788 --> 18:02.915
It's been very, very hard on all of us.

18:05.501 --> 18:06.335
Oh.

18:15.761 --> 18:17.888
Get it, get it, hey!

18:19.598 --> 18:22.518
-You two sure seem to be having fun.
-Oh, you know it!

18:22.601 --> 18:25.270
I think it is time for me to go!

18:25.354 --> 18:28.148
-Good night, both of you.
-Oh!

18:28.232 --> 18:30.025
Thank you so much.

18:30.109 --> 18:33.654
-Tonight was very needed.

18:33.737 --> 18:35.197
-You all right to get home?
-Yes.

18:35.280 --> 18:37.533
-All right.

18:37.616 --> 18:40.702
Do you really think that's the best price
I'll get on the apartment?

18:40.786 --> 18:43.664
We-- we do.
We think it's a very valid offer.

18:43.747 --> 18:45.332
Exactly. In this market?

18:45.415 --> 18:46.542
I understood her.

18:47.126 --> 18:48.669
I trust your judgment.

18:48.752 --> 18:51.672
I'll sign the things and do the stuff.

18:51.755 --> 18:52.965
-Seriously?
-Really?

18:53.507 --> 18:56.635
Onwards, motherfuckers, onwards.

18:56.718 --> 18:57.845
Yeah!

18:57.928 --> 19:01.932
-It worked! How did that work?
-Honey, you know I'm magic!

19:07.354 --> 19:12.192
Thank you, thank you, my chickens!

19:12.276 --> 19:15.821
Mwah! Mwah!

19:15.904 --> 19:18.699
-I'll be back in just a moment!
-Holy shit!

19:19.491 --> 19:22.578
I think that drag queen
was our couples therapist.

19:22.661 --> 19:24.663
Man, it really is a gig economy.

19:28.876 --> 19:29.877
Dr. Sweeny.

19:31.461 --> 19:32.838
Oh, hello, Michael.

19:32.921 --> 19:37.885
You should know, Colin walked out on me
right after our session with you.

19:37.968 --> 19:42.389
A session you described as a terrific
first step to falling in love again.

19:42.472 --> 19:43.640
Oh.

19:43.724 --> 19:45.934
I'm so sorry you're hurting, Michael.

19:46.518 --> 19:49.229
But I'm not a psychic. I'm a therapist.

19:49.313 --> 19:51.398
Maybe you're a better drag queen.

19:52.399 --> 19:53.317
Drag performer,

19:53.984 --> 19:56.445
who has to take the stage again
in 15 minutes,

19:56.528 --> 19:59.990
so how about you take
the bitter divorcé shit down a notch, huh?

20:00.073 --> 20:04.661
Wow! Wow, what a professional way
for a therapist to speak to an ex-patient.

20:04.745 --> 20:06.955
But I'm not a therapist
right now.

20:07.039 --> 20:09.458
I'm Miss Communication.

20:09.541 --> 20:12.127
And I can say
whatever the fuck I want to you

20:12.211 --> 20:15.547
when you come for me about my job,

20:15.631 --> 20:18.842
which I am very good at, okay?

20:18.926 --> 20:22.971
Are you? Because with Colin and me,
you were way off.

20:23.555 --> 20:26.016
You wanna know
what happened in that session?

20:26.516 --> 20:28.477
You heard exactly what you wanted to hear,

20:28.560 --> 20:31.104
which was the sound
of your whiny-ass voice

20:31.188 --> 20:32.981
suckin' all the air out of the room.

20:33.065 --> 20:35.567
You didn't even let your man speak.

20:35.651 --> 20:37.611
Maybe that was the problem
in your marriage,

20:37.694 --> 20:39.863
'cause it sure as shit wasn't me.

20:40.697 --> 20:43.742
Can I speak to Dr. Sweeny again?
'Cause Miss Communication's mean.

20:43.825 --> 20:45.035
No, I'm not done.

20:45.535 --> 20:48.956
Stop lookin' for answers.
Stop lookin' for someone to blame.

20:49.039 --> 20:51.083
He's gone. Let him go.

20:51.166 --> 20:52.793
You want someone to love?

20:52.876 --> 20:53.919
Love yourself.

20:54.002 --> 20:56.755
Love the people in your life
who still wanna be there,

20:56.838 --> 21:00.300
and keep your messy shit off of me, queen.

21:12.229 --> 21:14.523
-Did you hear all that?
-Hard not to.

21:15.691 --> 21:17.651
-You okay?
-No, I'm not.

21:19.027 --> 21:21.613
I'm getting really, really tired
of feeling

21:22.572 --> 21:23.407
wrong.

21:24.408 --> 21:26.910
Like I don't know what to do
to fucking get through this.

21:26.994 --> 21:29.162
Of course you don't, love. Who does?

21:30.789 --> 21:33.208
I mean,
Colin was a part of our world, too,

21:33.292 --> 21:36.461
and we're all trying to figure out
life without him the best we can.

21:37.713 --> 21:39.339
What?

21:39.423 --> 21:40.424
You mad at me now?

21:40.507 --> 21:41.800
No, no.

21:42.718 --> 21:43.552
Just…

21:45.137 --> 21:48.348
Thank you for being one of the people
who still wants to be in my life.

21:54.646 --> 21:55.480
I gotta go.

22:18.837 --> 22:20.797
Could you give it
to the guy at the end of the bar?

22:20.881 --> 22:22.090
-Sure.
-Thanks.

22:25.886 --> 22:27.220
From that guy down there.

22:49.368 --> 22:50.994
So did you know about the dog?

22:52.371 --> 22:53.205
I'm sorry.

22:54.498 --> 22:57.000
-I didn't want to be the one to tell you.
-I bet.

22:57.542 --> 22:59.878
For what it's worth,
the whole dog thing is bananas.

23:00.504 --> 23:02.047
Suddenly he wants a dog?

23:02.130 --> 23:05.300
I don't get what's goin' on with that man,
and I've tried.

23:05.384 --> 23:08.011
It's like someone flipped a switch.

23:08.095 --> 23:08.929
Yes.

23:10.013 --> 23:13.975
But I still went over there for dinner,
thinking, naively, that I could

23:14.559 --> 23:16.186
somehow figure it all out.

23:16.770 --> 23:19.606
Uncover some clue
that might explain what he did.

23:21.525 --> 23:22.401
And why.

23:23.652 --> 23:24.653
For me?

23:25.570 --> 23:26.822
Of course for you.

23:29.908 --> 23:32.953
I'm sorry, Stanley.
You're not the guy I'm mad at.

23:33.036 --> 23:33.870
I know.

23:35.580 --> 23:38.458
And I may never get my answer.
I've got to be okay with that.

23:40.252 --> 23:43.880
Besides, I think
a lot of what happened was my fault.

23:44.589 --> 23:49.052
I push people away
with my big, giant feelings.

23:49.928 --> 23:53.432
-Sucking the air out of rooms and--
-No, no, no. No. Don't do that.

23:54.015 --> 23:55.976
Don't blame yourself for what happened.

23:56.059 --> 23:58.562
I won't let you go down that path.
There's nothing good there.

24:00.188 --> 24:01.022
You got it?

24:03.316 --> 24:04.734
So I don't have giant feelings?

24:05.318 --> 24:08.905
I mean, could they use a little tweak
now and then? Sure.

24:10.157 --> 24:13.660
But you are absolutely
a person worth loving.

24:14.786 --> 24:15.620
Period.

24:19.249 --> 24:21.668
Thank you, my friend.

24:23.295 --> 24:24.629
-Uh, drink that.

24:25.422 --> 24:27.340
-I've already had three.
-Gladly.

24:28.425 --> 24:29.509
Oh!

24:34.556 --> 24:36.516
-Gotta take a picture.
