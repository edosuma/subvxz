00:02.697 --> 00:04.554
Previously on <i>Madam Secretary</i>...

00:04.555 --> 00:05.721
Well, this can't be good.

00:05.723 --> 00:07.627
The secretary of state's plane

00:07.628 --> 00:09.147
just went down over the Atlantic.

00:09.148 --> 00:10.782
- I want you to step in.
- Step into what?

00:10.783 --> 00:13.181
- Secretary of State.
- <i>Probably should've brought my own staff.</i>

00:13.182 --> 00:13.956
Probably.

00:13.957 --> 00:15.393
But you know what, their
boss had just died.

00:15.394 --> 00:17.055
I couldn't just clean house like that.

00:17.056 --> 00:18.926
- It's an encoded text.
- Saying what?

00:18.927 --> 00:19.691
It's from George.

00:19.692 --> 00:22.393
Vincent Marsh's plane
crash was not an accident.

00:22.394 --> 00:23.761
Be careful, Bess.

00:23.762 --> 00:25.530
This is me not being a politician.

00:25.531 --> 00:28.166
- Trust me.
- You'd better be right about this.

00:28.167 --> 00:29.467
I got the president to sign off.

00:29.468 --> 00:31.059
How could you do that
without my knowledge?

00:31.060 --> 00:33.938
By blatantly
circumnavigating your authority.

00:33.939 --> 00:34.973
What's wrong?

00:34.974 --> 00:36.140
George is dead.

00:36.141 --> 00:37.909
That wasn't an accident.

00:37.910 --> 00:40.911
I know.

00:43.873 --> 00:45.191
_

00:45.273 --> 00:46.845
WOMAN: Uh, sweetie,
will you bring this in, please?

00:46.845 --> 00:49.152
Thank you.

00:51.623 --> 00:53.458
That's wrong.

00:53.459 --> 00:54.592
It is not!

00:54.593 --> 00:56.294
Fine. Leave it.

00:56.295 --> 00:57.195
What's the answer?

00:57.196 --> 00:58.796
(laughs) You suck at math.

00:58.797 --> 01:00.264
- Hey!
- Don't say "suck."

01:00.265 --> 01:01.766
Make him stop bothering me!

01:01.767 --> 01:04.035
- Stop bothering your sister.
- I was helping.

01:04.036 --> 01:06.469
(gunshots nearby)
(woman screams)

01:07.972 --> 01:09.240
Okay.

01:09.241 --> 01:11.641
Stay here.

01:13.678 --> 01:15.879
(men shouting, gunshots nearby)

01:17.448 --> 01:19.850
(crowd chanting in Arabic)

01:22.487 --> 01:23.011
(automatic gunfire)

01:23.012 --> 01:24.305

01:24.356 --> 01:26.756
(chanting continues)

01:28.459 --> 01:30.861
(chanting continues)

01:35.800 --> 01:38.002
(automatic gunfire)

01:38.003 --> 01:40.804
(crowd cheering)

01:43.341 --> 01:46.044
(horn honking)

01:46.045 --> 01:48.778

01:49.714 --> 01:52.816
(men shouting)

01:54.485 --> 01:57.020

02:11.936 --> 02:13.104
(groans) No.

02:13.105 --> 02:14.739
It's this one.

02:14.740 --> 02:17.375
- Give me this...
- It's the landline.

02:17.376 --> 02:19.776
(ringing continues)

02:21.579 --> 02:23.281
Yes. Hello, hello?

02:23.282 --> 02:26.317
NADINE: Madam Secretary, at
approximately 0800 hours,

02:26.318 --> 02:28.152
<i>local time, our embassy in Yemen</i>

02:28.153 --> 02:31.723
<i>came under heavy encroachment
by a crowd of armed protestors.</i>

02:31.724 --> 02:34.358
(sighs) Define "encroachment."

02:34.359 --> 02:36.094
<i>It means they breached our perimeter.</i>

02:36.095 --> 02:38.429
<i>We have reports of gunfire.</i>

02:38.430 --> 02:40.531
Are they still outside the compound?

02:40.532 --> 02:42.700
<i>Yes. And their numbers are growing.</i>

02:42.701 --> 02:44.836
Okay, what's the threat assessment?

02:44.837 --> 02:47.038
<i>The situation is still fluid.</i>

02:47.039 --> 02:48.539
Let me put it this way.

02:48.540 --> 02:49.574
On a scale of one to ten,

02:49.575 --> 02:52.877
how far are we from another Benghazi?

02:52.878 --> 02:54.278
<i>Best guess...</i>

02:54.279 --> 02:57.882
<i>we're looking at a seven.</i>

02:57.883 --> 02:59.717
Okay, I'm gonna...

02:59.718 --> 03:01.686
I'm gonna SIVITS in with Paul.

03:01.687 --> 03:04.087
Put everybody on standby.

03:05.590 --> 03:07.425
(sighs)

03:07.426 --> 03:09.393
Baptism by fire.

03:09.394 --> 03:11.262
You were bored at the horse farm.

03:11.263 --> 03:13.231
No, I was not.

03:13.232 --> 03:15.166
Ah, there can't have been
more than 25 of them.

03:15.167 --> 03:16.868
Lot of yelling, shots in the air.

03:16.869 --> 03:18.035
Scared the hell out of us,

03:18.036 --> 03:19.871
but it was the shock more than anything.

03:19.872 --> 03:21.939
So there haven't been
protests leading up to this?

03:21.940 --> 03:23.608
Nothing. There was a drone strike

03:23.609 --> 03:24.909
in the Abyan Province yesterday,

03:24.910 --> 03:26.511
which apparently set them all off.

03:26.512 --> 03:29.280
Bet the Yemeni troops have
it under control for now.

03:29.281 --> 03:30.915
Has the crowd dispersed now?

03:30.916 --> 03:33.217
No, they're still out
there, but unarmed.

03:33.218 --> 03:34.690
They're just chanting, you know.

03:34.691 --> 03:36.454
Standard "Death to America" stuff.

03:36.455 --> 03:38.856
These things have a way of
picking up steam pretty quickly.

03:38.857 --> 03:40.458
I'd feel better about it if you took

03:40.459 --> 03:42.226
a nice, long diplomatic vacation.

03:42.227 --> 03:44.295
I can't do that. Cut and run
at the first loud noise?

03:44.296 --> 03:46.330
That's not part of the job description.

03:46.331 --> 03:48.566
Well, at least let me get
Jessica and the kids out.

03:48.567 --> 03:50.268
She's way ahead of you on that one.

03:50.269 --> 03:52.203
They're on the first flight to D.C.

03:52.204 --> 03:55.039
I'm gonna work on
beefing up your security.

03:55.040 --> 03:56.407
It's not necessary.

03:56.408 --> 03:57.708
I'll be the judge of that.

03:57.709 --> 04:01.778
Yes, ma'am, Madam Secretary.

04:09.087 --> 04:11.626
ELIZABETH: <i>Director Munsey,
what does the CIA have?</i>

04:11.627 --> 04:14.085
MUNSEY: The drone strike in the Abyan
Province was on a militant camp

04:14.086 --> 04:15.493
of fighters being trained
to kill Americans.

04:15.494 --> 04:18.029
Al-Qaeda are claiming that three
civilians were among the dead,

04:18.029 --> 04:20.531
and are circulating photos
of mangled women and children.

04:20.531 --> 04:23.100
The pictures are fake, but many
local Yemenis believe them.

04:23.101 --> 04:25.336
The crowd has doubled in
size since yesterday.

04:25.337 --> 04:27.538
The good news is that
they're much less volatile.

04:27.539 --> 04:29.907
There are no more reports of gunfire

04:29.908 --> 04:31.275
- (crowd shouting on TV)
- and the Yemeni

04:31.276 --> 04:33.211
Security Forces seem
to have it in hand.

04:33.212 --> 04:35.546
(mutes TV) Well, that's also the bad news.

04:35.547 --> 04:37.648
Without active aggression,
we're gonna have a hard time

04:37.649 --> 04:39.717
pushing the button on FAST.
That's Marine...

04:39.718 --> 04:42.720
Marine Fleet Anti-Terrorism
Security Teams. I know.

04:42.721 --> 04:45.590
I've been in a situation
to recommend that action.

04:45.591 --> 04:47.758
So you know how challenging
it is to get it approved.

04:47.759 --> 04:49.794
Have the protestors given
themselves a name?

04:49.795 --> 04:51.929
Their clarion cry is "Death to America."

04:51.930 --> 04:54.498
Early Intel was that they
are not an organized group.

04:54.499 --> 04:56.567
But they have been calling themselves

04:56.568 --> 04:58.736
"Al mawt Li Amreeka,"
which means...

04:58.737 --> 05:00.171
"Death to America."

05:00.172 --> 05:01.405
All right, so aside

05:01.406 --> 05:02.773
from a startling vocabulary,

05:02.774 --> 05:04.308
what else is in their arsenal?

05:04.309 --> 05:06.911
A handful of automatic weapons
and a lot of enthusiasm.

05:06.912 --> 05:08.212
What about Paul?

05:08.213 --> 05:09.512
What protection does he have

05:09.513 --> 05:11.726
other than the standard
Marine Guard complement?

05:11.727 --> 05:13.184
The ministry of the
interior has deployed

05:13.185 --> 05:14.867
a handful of troops for now.

05:14.868 --> 05:16.687
They don't have the
resources to keep them there,

05:16.688 --> 05:18.789
let alone send more if
the action escalates.

05:18.790 --> 05:20.689
The ambassador's office is still saying

05:20.690 --> 05:22.326
he doesn't want reinforcements.

05:22.327 --> 05:24.462
I know Paul.

05:24.463 --> 05:28.165
He was a visiting scholar
when I was at UVA.

05:28.166 --> 05:30.735
He wore cowboy boots with a
suit and drove a Harley.

05:30.736 --> 05:33.037
He's not a man whose sense
of environment you can trust.

05:33.038 --> 05:34.338
MUNSEY: Is there any way to send

05:34.339 --> 05:36.274
extra Marines without
declaring it an emergency?

05:36.275 --> 05:38.476
No, not without going
through Everard Burke.

05:38.477 --> 05:40.344
Chairman of the Appropriations Committee.

05:40.345 --> 05:42.480
Fighting off jihad is a cakewalk

05:42.481 --> 05:44.115
compared to getting anything past him.

05:44.116 --> 05:45.549
What kind of guy is he?

05:45.550 --> 05:47.385
Slow, methodical...

05:47.386 --> 05:48.719
cheap.

05:48.720 --> 05:50.621
It'll take us a month to get a meeting.

05:50.622 --> 05:51.989
I mean, what does he like?

05:51.990 --> 05:53.925
Fruit baskets? Steak?

05:53.926 --> 05:56.326
Is flirting gonna get me anywhere?

05:56.827 --> 05:58.995
Everybody has a weakness.

06:03.100 --> 06:04.802
MAN: Nice shot.

06:04.803 --> 06:06.769
You're up, Congressman.

06:18.783 --> 06:21.485
ELIZABETH: Nice shot.

06:21.486 --> 06:23.387
Congressman Burke? Elizabeth McCord.

06:23.388 --> 06:27.123
We haven't officially been introduced.

06:27.992 --> 06:29.393
Madam Secretary.

06:29.394 --> 06:31.329
I was told I might find you out here.

06:31.330 --> 06:32.596
You play?

06:32.597 --> 06:34.432
Uh, I was raised in Virginia

06:34.433 --> 06:36.200
by a man who wanted sons.

06:36.201 --> 06:38.269
What do you think?

06:38.270 --> 06:39.904
You know, now that I have
you, I was wondering

06:39.905 --> 06:41.472
if maybe we might
talk a little business?

06:41.473 --> 06:43.975
(sighs) Of course.

06:43.976 --> 06:46.944
We have a situation
at the embassy in Yemen.

06:46.945 --> 06:49.113
Yes, I've heard about that.

06:49.114 --> 06:51.382
I want to bring in
some military personnel

06:51.383 --> 06:52.750
on the ground for protection.

06:52.751 --> 06:54.518
Hmm, sounds expensive.

06:54.519 --> 06:55.686
Uh, not a full unit.

06:55.687 --> 06:58.055
Special ops forces. 50 guys.

06:58.056 --> 07:01.092
Madam Secretary, I am sure
that, uh, your boss is aware

07:01.093 --> 07:02.727
that he's coming up
against a hard deadline

07:02.728 --> 07:04.795
for pulling troops out of Afghanistan?

07:04.796 --> 07:06.931
- Yes.
- Well, uh, that involves

07:06.932 --> 07:08.399
a lot of military personnel.

07:08.400 --> 07:10.067
And that's not cheap.

07:10.068 --> 07:12.403
You think war is expensive?

07:12.404 --> 07:15.172
Wait until you get a load of peace.

07:15.173 --> 07:17.002
Well, perhaps if I could
get you to read the briefs

07:17.003 --> 07:18.576
that I sent over from my office?

07:18.577 --> 07:19.710
I've read them.

07:19.711 --> 07:21.711
The answer is no.

07:23.781 --> 07:26.450
Uh, I was, uh, gonna take a mulligan.

07:26.451 --> 07:27.651
Why don't you play through?

07:27.652 --> 07:29.453
No, that's all right. You go ahead.

07:29.454 --> 07:30.755
No, no really.

07:30.756 --> 07:33.256
I insist.

07:44.935 --> 07:46.336
(sighs)

08:15.099 --> 08:17.567
Thanks for your time.

08:19.370 --> 08:22.973
DALTON: <i>Now, what makes you think
this is large scale aggression</i>

08:22.974 --> 08:25.342
as opposed to small scale irritation?

08:25.343 --> 08:27.812
12 years of working
in the CIA under you.

08:27.813 --> 08:30.214
I was trained to recognize
a global hot spot.

08:30.215 --> 08:31.215
Give me the criteria.

08:31.216 --> 08:32.616
Organization.

08:32.616 --> 08:34.717
These guys have given
themselves a name.

08:34.719 --> 08:36.754
A modest show of retaliation.

08:36.755 --> 08:39.623
But the Marine Guard,
they're not allowed to engage.

08:39.624 --> 08:40.857
This group doesn't understand that.

08:40.859 --> 08:41.991
They perceive it as weakness.

08:41.993 --> 08:44.428
Yeah. And news coverage is increasing,

08:44.429 --> 08:46.831
which adds validity to their cause.

08:46.832 --> 08:48.299
It's a solid ground for precaution,

08:48.300 --> 08:50.294
but it doesn't qualify
as a dire security threat.

08:50.295 --> 08:52.371
There are protests outside
embassies all over the world.

08:52.372 --> 08:53.856
We have a Naval base in Djibouti.

08:53.857 --> 08:56.006
If things get worse, we
could have troops there

08:56.007 --> 08:57.141
in an hour and a half.

08:57.142 --> 08:58.876
Exactly. An hour and a half.

08:58.877 --> 08:59.844
We're preparing

08:59.845 --> 09:01.679
to pull troops out of Afghanistan.

09:01.680 --> 09:03.747
Sending the cavalry to Yemen
without sufficient provocation

09:03.748 --> 09:05.449
delivers entirely the wrong message.

09:05.450 --> 09:06.684
It looks like a shell game.

09:06.685 --> 09:07.952
I agree.

09:07.953 --> 09:09.420
Then I recommend pulling

09:09.421 --> 09:11.188
Ambassador Wellington out of there.

09:11.189 --> 09:12.656
Not an option.

09:12.657 --> 09:14.125
That's worse than sending forces.

09:14.126 --> 09:15.960
It's tantamount to an act of war.

09:15.961 --> 09:17.928
I think that's an exaggeration.

09:17.929 --> 09:20.164
Really? We once had
diplomatic relations with you,

09:20.165 --> 09:21.499
now we're shutting down the embassy and

09:21.500 --> 09:23.000
we have none?

09:23.001 --> 09:24.783
That's not an invitation to a sleepover.

09:24.784 --> 09:26.937
We're not braiding each
other's hair after that.

09:26.938 --> 09:28.539
She gets the point, Russell.

09:28.540 --> 09:29.940
Bess, I can't make a move here.

09:29.941 --> 09:31.242
My hands are tied.

09:31.243 --> 09:33.677
I have to kick this over to State.

09:33.678 --> 09:35.212
The situation has to be resolved

09:35.213 --> 09:37.114
and it can't look
like a military action.

09:37.115 --> 09:39.183
How you get that
accomplished is up to you.

09:39.184 --> 09:41.517
It's your call.

09:46.056 --> 09:48.325
So, when he says

09:48.326 --> 09:50.294
it's my call,

09:50.295 --> 09:52.530
what does he mean by that?

09:52.531 --> 09:55.498
He means it's your ass.

10:02.374 --> 10:07.062
Sync and corrections by awaqeded
- www.addic7ed.com -

10:18.321 --> 10:20.089
Got a call from Everard Burke's office.

10:20.090 --> 10:21.157
He was a little taken aback

10:21.158 --> 10:23.059
by your encounter on the golf course.

10:23.060 --> 10:24.327
Oh, what can I say?

10:24.328 --> 10:25.995
I'm a beast off the tee.

10:25.996 --> 10:28.764
My short game would've made him relax.

10:28.765 --> 10:30.800
All jokes aside, Madam Secretary.

10:30.801 --> 10:32.568
There's a concern that you
might be overreacting

10:32.569 --> 10:34.570
to the situation in Yemen.

10:34.571 --> 10:35.938
Thanks.

10:35.939 --> 10:38.040
Do you have any actual
Intel on the situation?

10:38.041 --> 10:39.275
Not much change.

10:39.276 --> 10:40.710
Crowd's about the same.

10:40.711 --> 10:43.813
Here. This is the only photograph

10:43.814 --> 10:45.615
of George I've got.

10:45.616 --> 10:47.215
Thanks.

10:48.551 --> 10:50.686
When we cleaned out
his desk at Langley,

10:50.687 --> 10:52.121
we couldn't find anything.

10:52.122 --> 10:55.157
He left no paper trail,
like he never existed.

10:55.158 --> 10:58.461
Well, he was good at his job.

10:58.462 --> 11:00.062
I didn't want to put
together a memorial

11:00.063 --> 11:01.230
without a recent photo.

11:01.231 --> 11:02.565
I will get this back to you.

11:02.566 --> 11:06.135
Hey, Andrew, you know, we, uh...

11:06.136 --> 11:08.937
we never got a chance to talk
about George's accident.

11:10.640 --> 11:13.409
Just wanted to know that
The Company handled it properly.

11:13.410 --> 11:14.644
I'm not sure I follow.

11:14.645 --> 11:16.178
He was a former operative

11:16.179 --> 11:20.049
who died in a dramatic
single-car collision.

11:20.050 --> 11:22.518
I trust you handled the investigation.

11:22.519 --> 11:26.756
You checked his online history, e-mail,

11:26.757 --> 11:30.560
bank accounts, professional
correspondence...

11:30.561 --> 11:32.228
Just tell me you looked into it.

11:32.229 --> 11:33.496
Thoroughly.

11:33.497 --> 11:34.630
Of course we did.

11:34.631 --> 11:36.732
And you're satisfied with the results.

11:36.733 --> 11:38.568
I know what you're getting at.

11:38.569 --> 11:41.070
Unfortunately, there was
too much damage to the body

11:41.071 --> 11:42.705
to test for substances.

11:42.706 --> 11:44.340
He was hitting the bottle pretty hard

11:44.341 --> 11:45.975
there toward the end.

11:45.976 --> 11:47.510
I don't think we can count it out,

11:47.511 --> 11:48.844
but we'll never really know.

11:48.845 --> 11:52.348
Of course, the official
word is just an accident.

11:52.349 --> 11:54.749
Of course.

11:55.618 --> 11:57.619
Thank you.

12:03.793 --> 12:05.361
ELIZABETH: So...

12:05.362 --> 12:07.063
I struck out with Mr. Burke

12:07.064 --> 12:09.699
and the president has put
the ball in my court.

12:09.700 --> 12:11.801
We need to come up with
a solution to Yemen.

12:11.802 --> 12:13.903
It needs to be fast and
it needs to be something

12:13.904 --> 12:16.105
that we can push the
button on ourselves.

12:16.106 --> 12:17.506
Madam Secretary...

12:17.507 --> 12:18.641
we have another problem.

12:18.642 --> 12:19.875
Since when?

12:19.876 --> 12:21.143
This morning.

12:21.144 --> 12:23.713
The headline was on
the Policy POV startup page.

12:23.714 --> 12:24.814
There are mentions everywhere,

12:24.815 --> 12:26.582
including the <i>Post</i> and the <i>Times.</i>

12:26.583 --> 12:29.952
There's also footage
on YouTube and TMZ.

12:29.953 --> 12:31.621
"Secretary of State's Daughter

12:31.622 --> 12:33.923
Leads Lovell University Protest,
Detained By Security."

12:33.924 --> 12:35.024
Yes, I can read.

12:35.025 --> 12:35.958
Any idea why she's decided

12:35.959 --> 12:37.059
to come out of hiding?

12:37.060 --> 12:38.327
MATT: Wait.

12:38.328 --> 12:39.662
You have a hidden daughter?

12:39.663 --> 12:41.263
She's not hidden.

12:41.264 --> 12:42.331
She's underrepresented.

12:42.332 --> 12:43.431
It was in the official bio.

12:43.432 --> 12:45.501
It was in all the papers during
the confirmation hearing.

12:45.502 --> 12:47.303
It's not her fault the public has

12:47.304 --> 12:49.839
the long-term memory of a goldfish.

12:49.840 --> 12:51.273
Madam Secretary,

12:51.274 --> 12:52.942
you've never mentioned her before.

12:52.943 --> 12:54.477
So even if you're not
trying to hide her,

12:54.478 --> 12:57.413
it's like you're trying to hide her.

12:57.414 --> 12:59.515
ELIZABETH: When I talked to the family

12:59.516 --> 13:01.584
about taking this job,
everyone agreed, but Stephanie

13:01.585 --> 13:03.386
had conditions.

13:03.387 --> 13:05.621
She didn't want to be
talked about in the press,

13:05.622 --> 13:07.657
she didn't want to trotted
out for functions

13:07.658 --> 13:09.859
and she didn't want to be
hounded by reporters.

13:09.860 --> 13:11.961
She asked that I keep

13:11.962 --> 13:13.829
her presence low-profile.

13:13.830 --> 13:15.398
She's a legal adult, she's in college,

13:15.399 --> 13:17.611
and she wants to live her
own life. I respect that.

13:17.612 --> 13:19.502
Then how did she go from Greta Garbo

13:19.503 --> 13:21.070
to Erin Brockovich overnight?

13:21.071 --> 13:23.205
Well, that I can't explain.

13:23.206 --> 13:24.874
She's never been outwardly political.

13:24.875 --> 13:26.609
It doesn't sound like her.
What's the issue?

13:26.610 --> 13:29.412
Lovell University is changing
its admissions policy

13:29.413 --> 13:31.781
from need blind to need aware,
which means a student's

13:31.782 --> 13:34.417
ability to pay will be
taken into consideration.

13:34.418 --> 13:35.584
She's against it.

13:35.585 --> 13:37.019
That's a worthy cause.

13:37.020 --> 13:38.487
The cause isn't the issue.

13:38.488 --> 13:41.457
Fine. You want me to talk to her

13:41.458 --> 13:43.192
and explain why the
Secretary of State's daughter

13:43.193 --> 13:45.561
can't be doing things like this?

13:45.562 --> 13:47.263
And we need to release a statement.

13:47.264 --> 13:49.131
Explaining your mystery daughter.

13:49.132 --> 13:50.299
Not a mystery daughter.

13:50.300 --> 13:52.501
By "mystery" do you mean
born out of wedlock

13:52.502 --> 13:54.003
or sired by aliens?

13:54.004 --> 13:56.328
MATT: Well, we'd like to remove all doubt

13:56.329 --> 13:57.873
about either of those speculations.

13:57.874 --> 13:59.245
ELIZABETH: Knock yourself out.

13:59.246 --> 14:01.110
Can we talk about

14:01.111 --> 14:02.478
matters of national security now?

14:02.479 --> 14:03.779
- Please?
- JAY: Sure.

14:03.780 --> 14:06.182
But the situation in Yemen
is not a long discussion.

14:06.183 --> 14:07.383
If we can't pull Wellington out

14:07.384 --> 14:09.318
and we can't send in military support,

14:09.319 --> 14:11.719
what do we have to talk about?

14:12.688 --> 14:14.255
The last resort.

14:14.957 --> 14:17.359
We have a discretionary fund.

14:17.360 --> 14:21.063
I'd like to think about hiring
private security contractors.

14:21.064 --> 14:22.897
(laughs softly) Okay, come on.

14:24.533 --> 14:26.869
You mean, like Vesuvian?

14:26.870 --> 14:29.371
I mean exactly like Vesuvian.

14:29.372 --> 14:31.774
- That might be a problem.
- I'm aware.

14:31.775 --> 14:33.909
DAISY: We are talking about
the people you referred to

14:33.910 --> 14:36.912
a year ago in a national publication as...

14:36.913 --> 14:39.248
"the latest guise of Satan,

14:39.249 --> 14:41.317
"bloodless mercenaries
who serve and protect

14:41.318 --> 14:42.651
"and kill out of naked ambition

14:42.652 --> 14:43.819
"rather than honor or duty,

14:43.820 --> 14:46.388
"while cashing a check
three times the size

14:46.389 --> 14:48.457
of anyone in military service."

14:48.458 --> 14:51.160
I really thought I'd cut the Satan line.

14:51.161 --> 14:52.962
The press will jump all over that.

14:52.963 --> 14:55.865
And my crack team will
handle it brilliantly.

14:55.866 --> 14:58.234
Look, on an ideological level,

14:58.235 --> 15:00.903
I'm opposed to everything
a private army stands for.

15:00.904 --> 15:03.739
But there is a reason they exist.

15:03.740 --> 15:05.541
Given our limited options,

15:05.542 --> 15:07.543
this would be the most efficient way

15:07.544 --> 15:09.044
to keep the ambassador safe.

15:09.045 --> 15:11.280
And unless I'm missing something,

15:11.281 --> 15:13.848
right now it's the only way.

15:21.724 --> 15:23.259
(indistinct conversations)

15:23.260 --> 15:25.461
STEVIE: <i>You guys are really</i>

15:25.462 --> 15:26.662
overreacting.

15:26.663 --> 15:28.464
I wasn't arrested... I was detained

15:28.465 --> 15:30.466
by the campus security.

15:30.467 --> 15:31.700
For like an hour.

15:31.701 --> 15:32.935
I understand that, but...

15:32.936 --> 15:34.937
And the need aware policy

15:34.938 --> 15:36.438
is so screwed up.

15:36.439 --> 15:38.140
I have a right to speak up

15:38.141 --> 15:39.909
against things that I
believe are wrong.

15:39.910 --> 15:41.811
Speak up? Yes.

15:41.812 --> 15:43.245
Organize a protest?

15:43.246 --> 15:45.546
That was not part of the agreement.

15:46.615 --> 15:48.017
Is that Mom talking?

15:48.018 --> 15:51.320
No, actually, it's the State Department.

15:51.321 --> 15:54.323
And as head of that, I guess, yeah.

15:54.324 --> 15:56.559
Look, just...

15:56.560 --> 15:59.562
try to stay below the
radar until Thanksgiving

15:59.563 --> 16:01.497
when we can all talk about this, okay?

16:01.498 --> 16:03.666
Okay.

16:03.667 --> 16:05.066
Thank you.

16:07.403 --> 16:09.638
(sighs heavily)

16:09.639 --> 16:12.875
Okay, here's the latest
Stephanie McCord business.

16:12.876 --> 16:15.711
Most popular headline,
some version of "It's A Girl!

16:15.712 --> 16:18.345
Madam Secretary Welcomes
a Newborn Adult Daughter."

16:18.346 --> 16:20.333
There's an article saying
she's illegally adopted,

16:20.334 --> 16:22.384
one saying she's a Communist

16:22.385 --> 16:23.853
and another saying she's a love child.

16:23.854 --> 16:25.020
Exact words.

16:25.021 --> 16:26.655
Wait, here's one randomly demanding

16:26.656 --> 16:27.857
to see Madam Secretary's

16:27.858 --> 16:29.325
birth certificate and her college records.

16:29.326 --> 16:31.093
All right, you knew it would be ugly.

16:31.094 --> 16:32.228
It's one news cycle

16:32.229 --> 16:33.963
and one uncomfortable late-night circuit.

16:33.964 --> 16:35.097
I don't think so.

16:35.098 --> 16:36.599
She has to put out a statement now.

16:36.600 --> 16:38.500
- She doesn't have time.
- Why? What's she doing?

16:38.501 --> 16:40.236
- Meeting with Satan.
- More specific, please?

16:40.237 --> 16:41.437
Oh, Isaac Bishop.

16:41.438 --> 16:42.805
The CEO of Vesuvian.

16:42.806 --> 16:44.073
The private security for Yemen.

16:44.074 --> 16:45.875
Oh. That Satan.

16:45.876 --> 16:47.910
I met with him. He
seems like a nice guy.

16:47.911 --> 16:49.544
That's how he gets you.

16:49.975 --> 16:50.622
I've come up with

16:50.623 --> 16:52.047
a threat assessment evaluation

16:52.048 --> 16:53.916
based on your memo
and the film footage.

16:53.917 --> 16:55.885
50 men on the ground should do it.

16:55.886 --> 16:58.387
Put some in the air if
you feel it's necessary,

16:58.388 --> 16:59.922
and then a helo or two on standby

16:59.923 --> 17:01.276
in case of a sudden evacuation.

17:01.277 --> 17:03.592
One should do it.

17:03.593 --> 17:05.194
We've pulled most of the personnel.

17:05.194 --> 17:08.263
The point is not to let it get to that.

17:08.265 --> 17:10.266
Our whole approach is
to demonstrate our ability

17:10.267 --> 17:11.467
and willingness to use force,

17:11.468 --> 17:12.667
so that we don't have to.

17:12.669 --> 17:14.637
I have your word on that.

17:14.637 --> 17:16.672
Of course.

17:16.673 --> 17:17.565
Can I ask you

17:17.566 --> 17:19.208
how you plan to handle
the financial end?

17:19.209 --> 17:22.310
We have a discretionary fund.

17:22.311 --> 17:24.780
This'll classify as a home improvement.

17:24.781 --> 17:26.781
Happy to pave over the
money trail accordingly.

17:26.782 --> 17:27.849
No.

17:27.851 --> 17:30.218
I'm not afraid if this becomes public.

17:30.920 --> 17:33.789
So the illusion of transparency?

17:33.790 --> 17:36.825
No, Mr. Bishop, actual transparency.

17:36.826 --> 17:39.028
I'm happy

17:39.029 --> 17:41.664
to defend actions
that protect our people.

17:41.665 --> 17:44.333
And making the ambassador's home safer

17:44.334 --> 17:46.669
qualifies as an improvement,
don't you think?

17:46.670 --> 17:49.036
Maybe I'll throw in a fountain.

17:50.205 --> 17:52.808
If anyone is well-acquainted
with your code of ethics,

17:52.809 --> 17:54.743
Madam Secretary, it is
"the new guise of Satan."

17:54.744 --> 17:57.646
I didn't actually call you Satan.

17:57.647 --> 17:59.648
No, no. Just my life's work.

17:59.649 --> 18:01.283
I was in academia then.

18:01.284 --> 18:04.320
I have a different job now.

18:04.321 --> 18:05.521
Right.

18:05.522 --> 18:06.956
You're a diplomat.

18:06.957 --> 18:09.325
I'm responsible for the safety

18:09.326 --> 18:11.726
of our employees overseas.

18:12.294 --> 18:13.562
I understand.

18:13.563 --> 18:16.265
Desperate times, desperate
measures and all of that.

18:16.266 --> 18:19.534
We'll let Shakespeare have the
last word on that, shall we?

18:21.203 --> 18:23.172
How does it feel?

18:23.173 --> 18:25.006
To make a deal with the devil?

18:26.275 --> 18:28.676
Thank you, Mr. Bishop.

18:36.452 --> 18:39.722
Do not come near me with that.

18:39.723 --> 18:42.056
Don't.

18:42.691 --> 18:44.293
I love you.

18:44.294 --> 18:46.360
I know.

18:47.496 --> 18:49.264
Can you really not give work a break?

18:49.265 --> 18:50.432
I am.

18:50.433 --> 18:52.201
I'm-I'm... I'm shopping.

18:52.202 --> 18:53.635
It's weird.

18:53.636 --> 18:55.537
Nobody's doing a wedge heel this fall.

18:55.538 --> 18:57.738
Right? Seriously.
I called my congressman.

18:58.774 --> 19:00.476
(door opens, door closes)

19:00.477 --> 19:02.778
HENRY: What? Hey!

19:02.779 --> 19:05.114
What are you doing here, Norma Rae?

19:05.115 --> 19:06.081
Go ahead.

19:06.082 --> 19:07.549
Get it out of your system.

19:07.550 --> 19:09.351
I just needed the one. I'm good.

19:09.352 --> 19:10.786
I'm good.

19:10.787 --> 19:12.588
How'd you get here so fast?
I just talked to you.

19:12.589 --> 19:13.589
I know.

19:13.590 --> 19:14.957
I hung up

19:14.958 --> 19:16.492
and I suddenly realized
what I needed to do.

19:16.493 --> 19:17.693
I quit.

19:17.694 --> 19:19.228
You quit what?

19:19.229 --> 19:21.063
College.

19:21.064 --> 19:23.565
Is there any more of that?

19:23.566 --> 19:25.067
No, no, no, no.

19:25.068 --> 19:26.434
Uh...

19:36.161 --> 19:38.188
STEVIE: <i>I can't believe
you don't even have</i>

19:38.188 --> 19:39.864
- a room for me.
- HENRY: You have a room.

19:39.865 --> 19:42.167
It just happens to be filled
with boxes at the moment.

19:42.168 --> 19:44.636
Don't get any ideas about
sharing a room with me.

19:44.637 --> 19:45.804
Don't worry.

19:45.805 --> 19:47.739
You know, for what it's worth,

19:47.740 --> 19:50.175
I applaud you for pulling
out of a corrupt system.

19:50.176 --> 19:51.776
- Thank you.
- ELIZABETH: Okay. Time for bed.

19:51.777 --> 19:53.978
- Let's go. You two, upstairs.
- HENRY: Out.

19:53.979 --> 19:56.181
Please.

19:56.182 --> 19:58.249
So you need the WI-Fi
password or anything?

19:58.250 --> 19:59.617
I'm good, Dad.

19:59.618 --> 20:02.187
Not that we want you
posting on Facebook...

20:02.188 --> 20:04.821
Okay. Your turn.

20:07.992 --> 20:09.594
Okay...

20:09.595 --> 20:11.229
Can we save the lecture for the morning?

20:11.230 --> 20:13.198
Sure.

20:13.199 --> 20:14.966
I think you know what I'm going to say.

20:14.967 --> 20:16.167
Mom,

20:16.168 --> 20:18.002
the need aware policy means

20:18.003 --> 20:19.504
that you can buy your degree.

20:19.505 --> 20:21.539
It doesn't make you
qualified to do anything.

20:21.540 --> 20:24.275
Meanwhile, as I'm sure you're aware,

20:24.276 --> 20:25.543
there's a dearth of employees

20:25.544 --> 20:27.345
in a whole host of
hands-on professions.

20:27.346 --> 20:29.848
Yes. Large machinery mechanics.

20:29.849 --> 20:31.983
You plan on working on tractors?

20:31.984 --> 20:33.318
I don't know what I'm going to do yet.

20:33.319 --> 20:34.953
I need more than half a
day to think about it.

20:34.954 --> 20:37.655
Well, let me take the
mystery out of it for you.

20:37.656 --> 20:38.990
You're going back to college.

20:38.991 --> 20:40.625
Not back to Lovell.

20:40.626 --> 20:43.260
I alerted my advisors
and signed the forms.

20:45.230 --> 20:47.866
Your cerebral cortex isn't fully formed

20:47.867 --> 20:50.001
until you're 25 years old.

20:50.002 --> 20:52.402
That's the decision-making
part of your brain.

20:53.438 --> 20:54.973
- That's science.
- (sighs)

20:54.974 --> 20:56.840
Good night, Mom.

21:09.454 --> 21:11.855
(people shouting in Arabic)

21:13.658 --> 21:16.059
(crowd chanting in Arabic)

21:23.835 --> 21:26.770
(chanting continues)

21:34.779 --> 21:37.080
(whistles sharply)

21:39.450 --> 21:41.685
(crowd chanting in Arabic)

21:47.458 --> 21:50.027
(tires screech)

21:52.897 --> 21:55.266
(barking)

21:55.267 --> 21:58.101
(shouting)

21:59.604 --> 22:02.005
(dogs barking)

22:14.619 --> 22:17.288
MATT: <i>There's going to be fallout</i>

22:17.289 --> 22:18.857
from her hiring Vesuvian.

22:18.858 --> 22:21.125
Look, I know that's just
amusing to the rest of you,

22:21.126 --> 22:23.027
but I got to write the actual statement.

22:23.028 --> 22:24.596
It's an easy spin.

22:24.597 --> 22:26.531
There's a difference between
philosophical thought,

22:26.532 --> 22:29.234
academia and practical application...

22:29.235 --> 22:31.135
work in action.

22:31.136 --> 22:33.438
MATT: Well, if it's so... easy,

22:33.439 --> 22:35.006
why don't you give me
the headline to that?

22:35.007 --> 22:36.474
Uh, "Secretary of State.

22:36.475 --> 22:37.575
"Discovers that Doing

22:37.576 --> 22:38.576
"is More Challenging than

22:38.577 --> 22:40.478
<i>Talking</i> About Doing"?

22:40.479 --> 22:41.646
And we still have to explain

22:41.647 --> 22:42.847
the mystery daughter.

22:42.848 --> 22:44.015
Not a mystery daughter.

22:44.016 --> 22:46.150
Blake... everyone appreciates

22:46.151 --> 22:47.685
your allegiance to your boss.

22:47.686 --> 22:50.347
Well, she is not my
boss, she's <i>our</i> boss.

22:50.348 --> 22:50.994
JAY: The fact is,

22:50.995 --> 22:53.258
she publicly denounced Vesuvian
and now she's employing them.

22:53.259 --> 22:55.426
We all have to figure out
a way to explain that.

22:55.427 --> 22:58.020
Well, call me goofy,
but I'm going with,

22:58.021 --> 22:59.510
"She's Concerned
with the Personal Safety

22:59.511 --> 23:00.851
of a State Department Official"?

23:00.852 --> 23:01.699
You're goofy.

23:01.700 --> 23:03.434
NADINE: Let's not get
lost in the weeds.

23:03.435 --> 23:05.536
We have to sell Vesuvian

23:05.537 --> 23:08.273
and defend her daughter's behavior.

23:08.274 --> 23:10.275
First order of business...

23:10.276 --> 23:11.409
the situation in Yemen.

23:11.410 --> 23:13.144
Oh, it was pretty quiet
there this morning...

23:13.145 --> 23:14.741
it looks like employing Vesuvian

23:14.742 --> 23:16.848
was a knee-jerk move; waste of money.

23:16.849 --> 23:18.116
Let's find a way to make it

23:18.117 --> 23:20.016
<i>not</i> look like that.

23:32.196 --> 23:33.564
Wow!

23:33.565 --> 23:35.133
Nice digs!

23:35.134 --> 23:36.401
- Hey.
- (chuckles)

23:36.402 --> 23:37.735
You're actually taking up

23:37.736 --> 23:38.836
my invitation for lunch?

23:38.837 --> 23:40.271
A girl's got to eat.

23:40.272 --> 23:41.940
(both moan)

23:41.941 --> 23:43.274
Seriously...

23:43.275 --> 23:44.876
this place is insane.

23:44.877 --> 23:46.110
Did you get a promotion?

23:46.111 --> 23:47.245
Uh... sort of.

23:47.246 --> 23:49.147
Theology Department is better funded.

23:49.148 --> 23:50.415
Hey, have a seat.

23:50.416 --> 23:51.582
(singsongy): Uh-oh...

23:51.583 --> 23:53.217
there's a pre-lunch discussion.

23:53.218 --> 23:54.786
Feels like a trap.

23:54.787 --> 23:56.786
Just... sit.

23:59.123 --> 24:00.458
(smacks lips)

24:00.459 --> 24:01.726
Consider giving your mom a break.

24:01.727 --> 24:03.628
God, Dad.

24:03.629 --> 24:05.196
You would defend her

24:05.197 --> 24:07.865
if she were standing over a
bloody corpse with a knife.

24:07.866 --> 24:09.434
I would not, it-it would totally depend

24:09.435 --> 24:10.802
who the corpse was.

24:10.803 --> 24:13.972
You guys just really don't
know me at all, do you?

24:13.973 --> 24:16.507
Other than sucking
snot out of your nose

24:16.508 --> 24:18.147
with a tube when you were two days old,

24:18.148 --> 24:19.717
I'm barely acquainted with you.

24:21.446 --> 24:22.647
Okay, come on,

24:22.648 --> 24:24.247
I'm hungry.

24:26.451 --> 24:28.219
STEVIE: Look, I'm not a brat.

24:28.220 --> 24:29.387
Hmm.

24:29.388 --> 24:30.621
I know how lucky I am

24:30.622 --> 24:32.390
- to have you guys as parents.
- Hmm.

24:32.391 --> 24:33.624
(both laugh)

24:33.625 --> 24:35.493
And when Mom asked us
about taking the job,

24:35.494 --> 24:36.728
I was on board;

24:36.729 --> 24:38.963
I thought it would be cool
to have a famous mother.

24:38.964 --> 24:40.264
Guess what?

24:40.265 --> 24:42.033
It's <i>not</i> cool.

24:42.034 --> 24:43.201
Tell me about it.

24:43.202 --> 24:44.802
Okay, even though you guys

24:44.803 --> 24:46.304
tried to keep me out of it,

24:46.305 --> 24:48.573
um, everyone at school
found out anyway.

24:48.574 --> 24:51.009
Then I had people who hated me

24:51.010 --> 24:52.910
(laughs): trying to be my friend.

24:52.911 --> 24:55.380
People who liked me
trying to be better friends.

24:55.381 --> 24:56.647
Then there were the people

24:56.648 --> 24:58.516
who were just openly hostile,

24:58.517 --> 24:59.984
because... they didn't approve

24:59.985 --> 25:01.185
of her politics

25:01.186 --> 25:02.587
or... the way she got the job

25:02.588 --> 25:04.122
or the way she wears her hair;

25:04.123 --> 25:05.323
anything, it doesn't matter.

25:05.324 --> 25:07.725
And it doesn't matter that I'm not her.

25:07.726 --> 25:11.529
What do you expect
your mom to do, quit?

25:11.530 --> 25:13.698
No!

25:13.699 --> 25:16.434
That's the reason I came home.

25:16.435 --> 25:19.137
She can't quit.

25:19.138 --> 25:21.504
So... I have to.

25:24.108 --> 25:25.476
The Vesuvian guys

25:25.477 --> 25:26.414
are here on post.

25:26.415 --> 25:28.146
I'm better protected than Kate Middleton.

25:28.147 --> 25:29.414
(laughs)

25:29.415 --> 25:31.182
It's good to hear.

25:31.183 --> 25:32.650
You really shouldn't have.

25:32.651 --> 25:34.118
But I have to admit,

25:34.119 --> 25:35.853
it's nice to see them out there.

25:35.854 --> 25:37.288
Your family back home?

25:37.289 --> 25:40.258
Yeah. My daughter's already
enrolled in swimming lessons.

25:40.259 --> 25:42.560
Good. Listen, I want you to keep

25:42.561 --> 25:44.562
the phone lines open;
I'm not taking any chances.

25:44.563 --> 25:45.763
Got it.

25:45.764 --> 25:49.033
Hey, by the way, the coffee
here, it's amazing...

25:49.034 --> 25:50.201
they bring it in from Turkey.

25:50.202 --> 25:51.669
We don't have anything like it at home.

25:51.670 --> 25:54.656
- (explosion)
- I'll bring you some next time I'm...

25:54.657 --> 25:55.706
Hey, Paul?!

25:55.707 --> 25:58.543
Paul, are you there?! _

25:58.544 --> 26:00.977
Blake!

26:07.464 --> 26:10.752
ELIZABETH: <i>We have no contact on
the ground... radios, cell phones,</i>

26:10.753 --> 26:12.920
cameras; everything's down.

26:12.921 --> 26:15.523
Drone images just show fire and rubble.

26:15.524 --> 26:17.324
What about Vesuvian?

26:17.325 --> 26:19.326
Haven't made contact. (sighs)

26:19.327 --> 26:20.861
How many guys on the ground?

26:20.862 --> 26:22.596
50. One in the air.

26:22.597 --> 26:24.565
You think that was enough?

26:24.566 --> 26:26.166
It was about 50 more

26:26.167 --> 26:28.768
than anyone else thought we should have.

26:32.806 --> 26:35.208
(female reporter speaking Arabic over TV)

26:36.443 --> 26:38.212
Where are we?

26:38.213 --> 26:41.393
MUNSEY: We're finally getting
some footage from Al-Harun.

26:42.383 --> 26:44.082
JACKSON: Any idea what they're saying?

26:44.083 --> 26:45.486
I have a rough translation.

26:45.487 --> 26:48.889
The protestors were
peaceful; no mention of

26:48.890 --> 26:50.090
Death to America.

26:50.091 --> 26:51.392
They're saying the

26:51.393 --> 26:52.960
American security guys

26:52.961 --> 26:54.361
fired first into the crowd.

26:54.362 --> 26:57.565
At least one civilian
death has been reported.

26:57.566 --> 26:59.500
The explosion was a retaliation

26:59.501 --> 27:00.801
to this action.

27:00.802 --> 27:03.137
DALTON: President Bassara
assures me his people

27:03.138 --> 27:05.411
are on top of it, which means
they're all in some room

27:05.412 --> 27:07.062
like this getting their story straight.

27:07.063 --> 27:08.561
Have our forces been deployed?

27:08.562 --> 27:10.629
Yes, sir. Special Ops are on their way.

27:10.630 --> 27:12.741
Should be on the ground
in 90 minutes or less.

27:12.742 --> 27:15.067
Is it safe to say, this
is another Benghazi?

27:15.068 --> 27:16.836
JACKSON: Oh, it's safe to say,

27:16.837 --> 27:18.971
it's a lot worse than that,
politically speaking.

27:18.972 --> 27:20.106
'Cause it looks like we didn't

27:20.107 --> 27:21.507
learn anything from the first one.

27:21.508 --> 27:23.609
We need more information.

27:23.610 --> 27:25.378
We're in the blind.

27:25.379 --> 27:27.699
There's nothing to do but
stay on top of this for now.

27:29.615 --> 27:32.450
(door opens)

27:34.086 --> 27:37.382
(phone buzzing)

27:37.383 --> 27:39.646
_

27:45.131 --> 27:46.365
HENRY: <i>How's it going in there?</i>

27:46.366 --> 27:47.666
ELIZABETH: <i>Not good.</i>

27:47.667 --> 27:49.635
We can't get any information

27:49.636 --> 27:52.271
and the images we're getting
look like the end of the world.

27:52.272 --> 27:53.739
Oh, I'm sorry.

27:53.740 --> 27:56.208
Guess this isn't a
good time to give you

27:56.209 --> 27:58.110
something else to think about.

27:58.111 --> 28:00.379
You're about to plead
Stevie's case, aren't you?

28:00.380 --> 28:01.947
It's not a case. It's a situation.

28:01.948 --> 28:03.616
Why didn't she come to me about it?

28:03.617 --> 28:05.651
(stammers) She's scared of you.

28:05.652 --> 28:07.620
Because of my long history

28:07.621 --> 28:09.588
of chastising and humiliating her?

28:09.589 --> 28:10.990
She doesn't want to let you down.

28:10.991 --> 28:12.458
- She said that?
- Of course not.

28:12.459 --> 28:14.693
'Cause last night it was all
about how she was gonna

28:14.694 --> 28:15.928
work on farm equipment.

28:15.929 --> 28:17.663
- That was a defense.
- Yes, I'm beginning

28:17.664 --> 28:19.331
- to pick up on that.
- Everyone at school

28:19.332 --> 28:21.267
has turned on her in one way or another.

28:21.268 --> 28:22.902
She's become a spectacle.

28:22.903 --> 28:25.171
And she can't handle it.

28:25.172 --> 28:26.972
That's why she started acting out

28:26.973 --> 28:29.742
and that's why she came home.

28:29.743 --> 28:32.244
So then she can... take some time off.

28:32.245 --> 28:34.980
And when she feels
better, she can go back.

28:34.981 --> 28:37.483
I just wish that she
wouldn't split us like this.

28:37.484 --> 28:40.453
And you're not helping,
acting like her lawyer.

28:40.454 --> 28:43.022
No, <i>you're</i> not helping.
That's what she's telling you.

28:43.023 --> 28:45.558
Excuse me, that's what
she's telling <i>you</i>

28:45.559 --> 28:46.926
and you're telling me.

28:46.927 --> 28:49.128
Since when do we have
a system like that?

28:49.129 --> 28:50.696
I was there.

28:50.697 --> 28:52.998
She was upset. I listened
to my daughter. Guilty.

28:52.999 --> 28:54.867
Really?

28:54.868 --> 28:56.202
You're gonna go there?

28:56.203 --> 28:57.703
Oh, I'm already regretting it.

28:57.704 --> 29:00.106
I will talk to her.

29:00.107 --> 29:02.440
And I'll make it better.

29:03.375 --> 29:05.444
I just wish she'd come to me first.

29:05.445 --> 29:07.646
Henry, look at me.

29:07.647 --> 29:10.116
I can't quit this job.

29:10.117 --> 29:11.917
I know.

29:11.918 --> 29:13.919
Can I?

29:13.920 --> 29:17.121
N-No, you can't.

29:18.057 --> 29:20.291
(phone buzzing)

29:20.421 --> 29:21.368
_

29:22.728 --> 29:25.129
I got to get back.

29:26.098 --> 29:28.333
- Hang in there.
- I will.

29:30.669 --> 29:33.305
MAN: <i>I'm inside what used to
be the ambassador's residence.</i>

29:33.306 --> 29:36.041
Not sure what did this.
Couple of grenades?

29:36.042 --> 29:38.544
Maybe they got some C4 in somehow.

29:38.545 --> 29:41.013
It's gonna take a while
to dig through this rubble.

29:41.014 --> 29:43.482
Is there any sign
of the Vesuvian detail?

29:43.483 --> 29:45.684
No, ma'am. Nobody in sight.

29:45.685 --> 29:48.229
I hate to use the language "cut and run"

29:48.230 --> 29:49.054
but those guys just work

29:49.055 --> 29:51.472
for a paycheck. I don't think I
would have hung around for that.

29:51.473 --> 29:54.293
What's the status on casualties?

29:54.294 --> 29:56.495
Don't have that
information right now, sir.

29:56.496 --> 29:58.497
But I can say with full certainty...

29:58.498 --> 30:01.999
that nobody could have survived this.

30:08.641 --> 30:11.410
And if we avoid making a statement,

30:11.411 --> 30:13.078
it makes us looks weak.

30:13.079 --> 30:15.247
Well, I am not going on the air

30:15.248 --> 30:17.650
with "no one could have
survived the attack."

30:17.651 --> 30:20.297
The destruction is gruesome.
His family's watching.

30:20.298 --> 30:22.755
- Absolutely.
- Madam Secretary, Isaac Bishop is here.

30:22.756 --> 30:26.091
Finally. Did he give up a spa day?

30:26.092 --> 30:27.660
He didn't say.

30:27.661 --> 30:30.362
Gee, I hope I'm not
interrupting anything.

30:30.363 --> 30:33.199
Not at all. How's it going?

30:33.200 --> 30:35.301
You tell me.

30:35.302 --> 30:37.636
I've been unable to
raise any of my men.

30:37.637 --> 30:39.772
We have a shutdown procedure,
just as the military does.

30:39.773 --> 30:41.574
They can't take a chance on
anyone following a signal.

30:41.575 --> 30:43.042
I'm sure we'll hear from them

30:43.043 --> 30:45.878
any minute and as soon as I do,
you'll be the first to know.

30:45.879 --> 30:49.582
Al-Harun is reporting that
your guys fired into the crowd

30:49.583 --> 30:50.983
and provoked the attack.

30:50.984 --> 30:53.351
Let's not convict them just yet, okay?

30:55.621 --> 30:58.224
You let me know the minute I can.

30:58.225 --> 31:01.025
Yes, ma'am.

31:13.504 --> 31:14.578
ELIZABETH: <i>Hello.</i>

31:14.579 --> 31:15.578
Hi.

31:15.579 --> 31:16.530
Hey, Mom.

31:16.531 --> 31:19.249
- Hi.
- You okay?

31:19.250 --> 31:20.817
I'm fine.

31:20.818 --> 31:22.085
- Hi.
- Hi.

31:22.086 --> 31:23.386
We saved you dinner.

31:23.387 --> 31:26.589
Wow, that was really sweet. Thank you.

31:26.590 --> 31:27.991
Maybe you'd like a... (quietly) drink?

31:27.992 --> 31:30.893
(quietly): Yeah, I would. A big one.

31:33.596 --> 31:35.699
I can't believe you guys.

31:35.700 --> 31:37.367
Whoa. What guys?

31:37.368 --> 31:40.904
The State Department.
You used Vesuvian?

31:40.905 --> 31:44.341
They're mercenaries.
They're completely corrupt.

31:44.342 --> 31:45.742
Why didn't you send troops?

31:45.743 --> 31:47.677
Because they wouldn't authorize it.

31:47.678 --> 31:49.212
Who's they?

31:49.213 --> 31:52.082
Stevie, mom knows this guy
that's probably dead.

31:52.083 --> 31:53.350
It's not just a headline.

31:53.351 --> 31:54.951
Yeah, it's not a kingdom, all right?

31:54.952 --> 31:56.753
She-She can't just do what she wants.

31:56.754 --> 31:59.089
Uh, you know what, you guys?
(clears throat)

31:59.090 --> 32:01.057
Would you mind giving
us a minute with your

32:01.058 --> 32:02.859
sister, please?

32:02.860 --> 32:05.261
Of course.

32:05.262 --> 32:07.863
ELIZABETH: Thank you.

32:11.768 --> 32:13.803
I understand you're upset.

32:13.804 --> 32:16.339
Your dad told me about
what happened at school.

32:16.340 --> 32:18.174
I am so sorry, Stevie.

32:18.175 --> 32:20.143
I wish that you'd
talked to me about it.

32:20.144 --> 32:23.079
- I was trying to be a team player.
- I know,

32:23.080 --> 32:26.015
and I really I appreciate it.

32:26.016 --> 32:28.118
This whole thing has turned out to be

32:28.119 --> 32:31.254
a lot harder on all of us
than we anticipated.

32:31.255 --> 32:33.256
And it's still relatively new.

32:33.257 --> 32:35.892
We need to find out
a way to get through it.

32:35.893 --> 32:37.961
So...

32:37.962 --> 32:41.164
we're okay with you leaving
college. Taking a year off.

32:41.165 --> 32:43.433
But, in the meantime,
you got to stay busy.

32:43.434 --> 32:45.101
You got to start looking for a job.

32:45.102 --> 32:46.587
We'd be glad to help
you with your résumé.

32:46.588 --> 32:47.564
Yeah.

32:48.606 --> 32:50.774
What, you mean, like,
working in an office?

32:50.775 --> 32:52.075
Being a waitress?

32:52.076 --> 32:54.911
Well, whatever interests you.

32:54.912 --> 32:56.679
None of it interests me.

32:56.680 --> 32:58.715
I'm working on a novel.

32:58.716 --> 33:01.151
I-I was gonna take the
time to finish that.

33:01.152 --> 33:03.086
Well, you can still write your novel.

33:03.087 --> 33:04.754
Everybody needs a day job.

33:04.755 --> 33:06.788
Chekhov was a doctor.

33:09.360 --> 33:10.795
(phone buzzing)

33:10.796 --> 33:12.562
Oh.

33:14.697 --> 33:16.433
Oh, God. We have more Intel coming in.

33:16.434 --> 33:18.501
I got to go back. I'll
see you guys later.

33:18.502 --> 33:20.284
- Bye.
- Bye.

33:21.905 --> 33:23.147
Oh...

33:23.908 --> 33:25.842
(door opens, closes)

33:25.843 --> 33:27.310
This doesn't feel like guidance.

33:27.311 --> 33:29.746
It feels punitive.

33:29.747 --> 33:32.415
Okay. Look, honey.

33:32.416 --> 33:35.385
College is like a four-year
deferment from real life.

33:35.386 --> 33:36.719
You say you don't want the full four,

33:36.720 --> 33:39.154
so you gotta go to work.

33:40.323 --> 33:41.324
Tell me the truth.

33:41.325 --> 33:43.092
Is this you or is this her?

33:43.093 --> 33:44.828
This is us.

33:44.829 --> 33:46.395
We're a unit.

33:47.030 --> 33:49.097
You got that?

33:56.606 --> 33:58.641
(sighs)

33:58.642 --> 34:00.909
(people talking quietly)

34:03.213 --> 34:06.216
I came as soon as I got the message.

34:06.217 --> 34:07.984
JACKSON: You haven't missed anything.

34:07.985 --> 34:09.185
Mr. Bishop refused to give us

34:09.186 --> 34:11.321
any information until you arrived.

34:11.322 --> 34:13.014
BISHOP: Technically speaking, I do work

34:13.014 --> 34:14.456
for Madam Secretary.

34:14.458 --> 34:16.493
What's going on?

34:16.494 --> 34:17.946
BISHOP: I just started receiving

34:17.947 --> 34:18.996
communication from my men.

34:18.998 --> 34:20.202
They waited until they were completely

34:20.203 --> 34:21.737
out of the war zone to get in touch.

34:21.737 --> 34:23.040
We've located them in a Vesuvian

34:23.041 --> 34:24.967
safe house, and if you're
ready, we'll connect with them.

34:24.969 --> 34:27.036
I believe we're more than ready.

34:27.036 --> 34:29.404
TECH: We've got video coming in.

34:30.306 --> 34:32.509
- Oh...
- Oh, Paul.

34:32.510 --> 34:35.145
Hey. It is really good to see you.

34:35.146 --> 34:36.746
WELLINGTON: It's really good to be seen.

34:36.746 --> 34:39.815
Next time you ask me to vacate
the premises, Madam Secretary,

34:39.817 --> 34:41.384
that's exactly what I'm gonna do.

34:41.385 --> 34:43.186
You okay?

34:43.187 --> 34:45.344
Yeah, not a scratch,
thanks to these boys.

34:45.346 --> 34:47.357
The first explosion
didn't do much damage.

34:47.358 --> 34:50.493
My men mobilized and
evacuated Mr. Wellington.

34:50.494 --> 34:52.128
He was well inside an armored vehicle

34:52.129 --> 34:53.530
when the second explosion occurred.

34:53.531 --> 34:55.732
They proceeded away
from the high-risk area

34:55.733 --> 34:58.268
and did not attempt contact
until the package...

34:58.269 --> 35:00.270
I mean, the ambassador... was secure,

35:00.271 --> 35:01.371
according to our protocol.

35:01.372 --> 35:02.639
We've also received better Intel

35:02.640 --> 35:03.907
from our people on the ground.

35:03.908 --> 35:05.575
Al-Harun reporting was,

35:05.576 --> 35:06.810
in fact, not accurate.

35:06.811 --> 35:08.311
Our men did not fire first.

35:08.312 --> 35:10.113
I believe you mean my men, Mr. Munsey.

35:10.114 --> 35:12.080
Of course.

35:13.483 --> 35:15.418
The only casualty was one of my men.

35:15.419 --> 35:16.953
A sweeper. He was checking the premises

35:16.954 --> 35:18.754
to make sure all souls had cleared out.

35:22.325 --> 35:23.460
I'm sorry to hear that.

35:23.461 --> 35:25.528
So were we, Madam Secretary.

35:25.529 --> 35:27.329
He was aware of the risk.

35:28.665 --> 35:30.099
Thank you, Mr. Bishop.

35:30.100 --> 35:32.101
We are indebted to
your security forces.

35:32.102 --> 35:34.003
However, your display of theatrics here

35:34.004 --> 35:35.138
was unworthy of them.

35:35.139 --> 35:36.506
I have my way, Mr. President.

35:36.507 --> 35:37.740
You all have yours.

35:37.741 --> 35:40.910
If that's all, Mr. Bishop,

35:40.911 --> 35:42.579
we'll, uh, say good bye to you

35:42.580 --> 35:45.281
and get on with our
situational assessment.

35:45.282 --> 35:48.283
Pleasure doing business, gentlemen. Ma'am.

35:50.687 --> 35:53.156
That's quite a character
you found there.

35:53.157 --> 35:54.157
You're welcome.

35:54.158 --> 35:56.226
JACKSON: Very happy to have you safe

35:56.227 --> 35:57.494
and sound, Mr. Ambassador.

35:57.495 --> 35:59.729
We'll get you home that way, too.

35:59.730 --> 36:00.763
Thank you.

36:00.764 --> 36:02.130
I'm looking forward to it.

36:03.600 --> 36:05.502
That's about as close as it gets.

36:05.503 --> 36:08.036
We got very lucky.

36:11.774 --> 36:13.576
(clears throat)

36:13.577 --> 36:15.111
May I take a moment, sir?

36:15.112 --> 36:17.713
Go ahead, Bess.

36:24.187 --> 36:26.356
Mr. Bishop.

36:26.357 --> 36:28.992
The man who died in this operation...

36:28.993 --> 36:30.994
I would like to tell his family.

36:30.995 --> 36:32.695
They've already been told.

36:32.696 --> 36:35.698
Well, then, I'd like to see them.

36:35.699 --> 36:37.433
That's not protocol, ma'am.

36:37.434 --> 36:39.369
You may have picked up on this:

36:39.370 --> 36:41.771
I'm not big on protocol.

36:41.772 --> 36:44.240
Then that makes us two peas in a pod.

36:44.241 --> 36:46.509
- May I call you Elizabeth?
- No.

36:46.510 --> 36:48.878
Madam Secretary, you should know this.

36:48.879 --> 36:49.895
That little article you wrote?

36:49.896 --> 36:51.748
You know, the one where
you called me Satan?

36:51.749 --> 36:53.883
I-I didn't actually call you Satan...

36:53.884 --> 36:55.184
It changed our policy.

36:55.185 --> 36:57.153
Our guys had

36:57.154 --> 36:59.022
a tendency to fire at
first provocation.

36:59.023 --> 37:00.327
Made some bad calls under pressure.

37:00.328 --> 37:02.898
Following your article,
we did a lot of training

37:02.899 --> 37:04.894
and we built some real
restraint into our procedures.

37:04.895 --> 37:07.397
I think, in this case, it paid off.

37:07.398 --> 37:10.300
We didn't fire first.

37:10.301 --> 37:11.734
I'm grateful.

37:11.735 --> 37:13.702
It was your idea.

37:16.506 --> 37:18.141
What you did for me back there?

37:18.142 --> 37:19.375
It was unnecessary.

37:19.376 --> 37:21.010
I'd be tempted to thank you,

37:21.011 --> 37:22.445
but it was very risky.

37:22.446 --> 37:26.482
That is the President
of the United States.

37:26.483 --> 37:28.483
Yeah, I didn't vote for him.

37:33.356 --> 37:35.757
(crickets chirping)

38:06.289 --> 38:08.691
This is my son, Dylan.

38:08.692 --> 38:10.560
Dylan.

38:10.561 --> 38:13.195
Nice to meet you.

38:24.107 --> 38:26.709
Thank you for seeing me so quickly.

38:26.710 --> 38:28.711
We were impressed by your résumé.

38:28.712 --> 38:30.079
You did a lot of copy editing

38:30.080 --> 38:32.115
at Lovell, I see.

38:32.116 --> 38:34.050
STEVIE: Yes, and I did some freelancing

38:34.051 --> 38:35.618
for charity organizations.

38:35.619 --> 38:38.354
I believe very strongly in your cause.

38:38.355 --> 38:40.423
Potable water for the developing world

38:40.424 --> 38:42.492
is the most pressing issue of our time.

38:42.493 --> 38:43.893
So you said in your e-mail.

38:43.894 --> 38:45.395
Your passion was well articulated.

38:45.396 --> 38:47.830
- Thank you.
- Sit.

38:47.831 --> 38:49.799
I'm afraid your résumé needs work.

38:49.800 --> 38:51.100
It's not up to date.

38:51.101 --> 38:52.101
It's not?

38:52.102 --> 38:54.184
You haven't listed your BA.

38:54.185 --> 38:56.172
It looks like you haven't
graduated college.

38:56.173 --> 38:58.908
Oh. Well...

38:58.909 --> 39:00.743
that's because I haven't
graduated college.

39:00.744 --> 39:03.379
This is a full-time position.

39:03.380 --> 39:05.048
It requires a four-year degree.

39:05.049 --> 39:07.850
I thought you might make an exception.

39:07.851 --> 39:09.786
I'm sorry, we can't.

39:09.787 --> 39:11.220
We'll keep your résumé on file.

39:11.221 --> 39:14.489
You can contact us when you've
completed your education.

39:15.324 --> 39:16.725
Thanks.

39:31.941 --> 39:33.443
Ms. Hardwick...

39:33.444 --> 39:36.045
I have an unusual

39:36.046 --> 39:39.347
amount of exposure to world politics.

39:40.950 --> 39:43.318
My mother is Elizabeth McCord.

39:44.420 --> 39:45.822
The Secretary of State?

39:45.823 --> 39:48.256
Yes.

39:49.992 --> 39:53.162
Well, that kind of... exposure

39:53.163 --> 39:56.466
creates an interesting perspective.

39:56.467 --> 39:59.534
Perhaps we can work something out.

40:02.271 --> 40:04.507
No. Sorry, we can't.

40:04.508 --> 40:07.208
Thank you for your time.

40:18.188 --> 40:19.395
Hi. Good afternoon.

40:19.396 --> 40:21.206
I'm glad I caught you.
Do you have a minute?

40:21.206 --> 40:22.873
Uh, not really.

40:22.874 --> 40:26.777
I just got confirmation
from our SEAL team

40:26.778 --> 40:29.480
that they captured the ringleaders
in the embassy attack.

40:29.481 --> 40:32.516
The Yemenis are fully
cooperating with the rendition.

40:32.517 --> 40:34.551
They're being taken into
FBI custody as we speak.

40:34.552 --> 40:36.619
Good.

40:37.287 --> 40:39.456
The Yemeni government

40:39.457 --> 40:41.425
also agreed to rebuild the embassy.

40:41.426 --> 40:43.894
So Wellington could be back
in there within the year.

40:43.895 --> 40:45.262
All right, that's great.

40:45.263 --> 40:46.730
Sorry, I've got a call holding.

40:46.731 --> 40:48.999
How long do you think
you're going to punish me

40:49.000 --> 40:50.334
for going around you?

40:50.335 --> 40:52.670
I don't know what you mean.

40:52.671 --> 40:55.838
"We got lucky yesterday"?

40:56.507 --> 40:58.742
That's one way to look at it.

40:58.743 --> 41:01.477
Yes, I know.

41:02.479 --> 41:03.647
If it's any consolation,

41:03.648 --> 41:05.182
that's not how the president sees it.

41:05.183 --> 41:06.850
He thinks you saved his ass.

41:06.851 --> 41:07.918
Told me to tell you that.

41:07.919 --> 41:11.387
Were you... going to tell me that?

41:13.023 --> 41:16.025
I hadn't decided.

41:25.602 --> 41:26.870
(door closes)

41:26.871 --> 41:29.071
Hello?

41:30.741 --> 41:33.009
Hi.

41:36.480 --> 41:38.449
I will give you $50 cash

41:38.450 --> 41:40.316
for a bite of what's in that bowl.

41:43.721 --> 41:46.156
Well, you got really lucky
about the Wellington thing.

41:46.157 --> 41:47.291
Congratulations.

41:47.292 --> 41:49.860
Let's not to use the "L" word, shall we?

41:49.861 --> 41:52.863
Why? Did you pull off
some badass diplomacy?

41:52.864 --> 41:55.466
Let's just say a strategy came together

41:55.467 --> 41:57.401
and some people made

41:57.402 --> 42:00.537
very big sacrifices to make it happen.

42:00.538 --> 42:02.506
Yeah, the Vesuvian guy.

42:02.507 --> 42:03.540
I heard.

42:03.541 --> 42:04.641
That's too bad.

42:04.642 --> 42:07.444
How'd your job search go today?

42:07.445 --> 42:09.246
(laughs)

42:09.247 --> 42:10.814
Uh, unsuccessful.

42:10.815 --> 42:12.583
That's all right.

42:12.584 --> 42:13.784
It's just day one.

42:13.785 --> 42:16.018
- Something'll come up, you know?
- Mm-hmm.

42:19.423 --> 42:21.091
Don't ever tell me how to make this.

42:21.092 --> 42:23.427
I mean, ever. Mmm.

42:23.428 --> 42:25.795
Mmm.

42:26.830 --> 42:28.198
Uh, yeah, Dad opened that.

42:28.199 --> 42:29.700
I looked at it. I hope that's okay.

42:29.701 --> 42:31.383
Yeah.

42:32.103 --> 42:34.004
George was a good friend.

42:34.005 --> 42:35.671
He was.

42:36.874 --> 42:39.342
Remember those bad magic
tricks he used to do?

42:40.477 --> 42:42.249
You never fell for those?

42:42.475 --> 42:43.576
No!

42:43.577 --> 42:45.783
- Even as a kid?
- No, they were terrible.

42:45.784 --> 42:47.851
(laughs)

42:47.852 --> 42:49.219
He was funny, though.

42:49.220 --> 42:53.223
He could hide an entire
top secret operations,

42:53.224 --> 42:54.958
make it disappear into thin air,

42:54.959 --> 42:57.094
but not a quarter.

42:57.095 --> 42:59.096
(both laughing)

42:59.097 --> 43:00.364
No.

43:00.365 --> 43:03.199
You could always see
it under his thumb.

43:03.292 --> 43:04.685
_

43:05.135 --> 43:07.471
How did he die?

43:07.472 --> 43:08.806
A car crash.

43:08.807 --> 43:10.541
Oh.

43:10.542 --> 43:12.375
How'd it happen?

43:20.184 --> 43:23.019
It was an accident.

43:28.956 --> 43:37.712
