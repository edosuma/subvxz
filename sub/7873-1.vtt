00:40.164 --> 00:43.656
Shut up, Steve!
I have a term paper due.

00:43.767 --> 00:46.031
Ooh, yeah, right.
Community college.

00:46.136 --> 00:49.037
Big girl. Big girl.
Hey, you think that diploma...

00:49.139 --> 00:52.438
will help you land a better section when
you're waitressing at the Olive Garden?

00:52.543 --> 00:54.670
Think you'll hit puberty
before you turn 14?

00:54.778 --> 00:56.746
Why? You wanna do it with me?
You're sick.

00:56.847 --> 00:59.782
Steve, you've only got one sister.
Be nice.

00:59.883 --> 01:02.408
And, Hayley,
Steve's big-boy hair isn't gonna...

01:02.519 --> 01:05.010
come in any faster
with you taunting him.

01:05.122 --> 01:07.249
Oh, Francine, Liebchen...

01:07.357 --> 01:10.019
I love the way you rule
with an iron fist.

01:10.127 --> 01:14.086
You know, perhaps when you are finished there,
you would stick your naughty pinky finger...

01:14.198 --> 01:16.325
into mein bowl
und let me feel you.

01:16.433 --> 01:20.267
- Klaus, I don't think.
- You're right. When the kids are gone.

01:20.370 --> 01:22.497
No, Roger, you cannot
borrow the car!

01:22.606 --> 01:26.770
You think you'd be a little more grateful
to the guy who saved your life at Area 51.

01:26.877 --> 01:31.211
If my superiors at the C.I.A. found out you were
living here, we'd have our memories erased.

01:31.315 --> 01:34.341
Did you see Memento?
It's not as good the second time.

01:34.451 --> 01:37.682
- The point is, you are not allowed to leave the house.
- For God's sakes, Stan.

01:37.788 --> 01:39.688
I just wanna
pick up a pack of smokes.

01:39.790 --> 01:42.418
Have you managed
to contact your home planet yet?

01:42.526 --> 01:46.018
Oh, you know, I was gonna do it yesterday,
but I got distracted.

01:46.130 --> 01:49.258
VH1 was running
this "I Love the '80s" marathon.

01:49.366 --> 01:51.459
Did you know Lou Ferrigno was deaf?

01:51.568 --> 01:54.298
I don't know. Somehow it's hard
to take him as seriously.

01:54.404 --> 01:57.862
Oh, hey, Francine, did you get
those pecan sandies I asked for?

01:57.975 --> 02:02.469
Oh, Roger, I'm sorry. I was
at the market yesterday, and I forgot.

02:02.579 --> 02:07.141
Pretty sure I asked for pecan sandies.

02:07.251 --> 02:10.777
- I'll pick some up this afternoon.
- Francine, be careful today.

02:10.888 --> 02:14.119
We're at terror alert orange,
which means something might go down...

02:14.224 --> 02:16.954
somewhere in some way
at some point in time, so look sharp!

02:17.060 --> 02:19.153
You know, Dad, it's great that
you and your C.I.A. buddies...

02:19.263 --> 02:22.391
have created a fun little system
to keep the masses paralyzed in fear.

02:22.499 --> 02:24.763
You like shavin' your armpits,
Hayley, huh?

02:24.868 --> 02:27.735
'Cause if the terrorists take over
this country, that's the first thing to go.

02:32.376 --> 02:34.901
It's just toast, Dad.

02:35.012 --> 02:37.742
This time it was toast,
Hayley this time.

02:37.848 --> 02:39.839
It's okay.
This one'll be mine.

02:39.950 --> 02:43.886
Hey, Steve, how's it goin' with that gal
on the lacrosse team I picked out for ya?

02:43.987 --> 02:46.717
Actually, Dad,
I have decided to go for the brass ring.

02:46.823 --> 02:52.125
Today I'm asking out Lisa Silver,
head cheerleader and future Mrs. Steve Smith.

02:52.229 --> 02:55.926
Yeah. I like the sound of that:
Steve Smith.

02:56.033 --> 02:58.297
That's my boy.
You hear that, Francine?

02:58.402 --> 03:00.802
Hey, Francine, tell Steve how many girls
I dated in high school.

03:00.904 --> 03:03.464
- I didn't meet you till college.
- No, but I've told you.

03:03.574 --> 03:06.475
- Steve, I sure hope she says yes.
- Don't worry.

03:06.577 --> 03:10.707
She won't turn you down. You're a Smith,
and a Smith always gets his girl.

03:12.916 --> 03:15.248
Resist him, Francine.
Resist him!

03:15.352 --> 03:18.947
You und I are meant to be.
Happy hour!

03:21.191 --> 03:23.751
Steve, isn't Lisa Silver
way out of your league?

03:23.860 --> 03:26.260
Well, now, Hayley, don't bury him
before he's dead.

03:26.363 --> 03:29.526
I think you got a shot, Steve, as long
as you don't wear that Shazam! shirt.

03:31.668 --> 03:33.761
Oh, don't everybody
help at once.

03:33.870 --> 03:37.567
My goodness, Roger. When
was the last time you weighed yourself?

03:37.674 --> 03:40.871
Francine.
You know, we can't all look...

03:40.978 --> 03:43.913
like those anorexic aliens
in the James Cameron movies.

03:44.014 --> 03:46.414
I'm sorry, Roger,
but I'm putting you on a diet.

03:46.516 --> 03:50.384
- Starting today, no more junk food.
- What? No.

03:50.487 --> 03:54.218
No. Not my Franken Berries. Oh, Francine,
please. Be reasonable.

03:54.324 --> 03:58.260
Oh, God.
I've got a bear claw in my ass.

04:00.130 --> 04:03.759
Okay. So that's two million halogen lamps
and 500,000 coffee tables.

04:03.867 --> 04:06.097
- Thanks a lot.
- Hey, Stan. What was that all about?

04:06.203 --> 04:08.865
Oh, we just signed a contract
with IKEA to furnish Iraq.

04:08.972 --> 04:11.440
Basically, the whole country's gonna
look like your first apartment.

04:11.541 --> 04:14.840
I like this. It fits with our hip,
twentysomething lifestyle.

04:14.945 --> 04:18.608
Oh, for Allah's sake,
put some clothes on!

04:18.714 --> 04:21.946
Now, how about a beer?

04:22.052 --> 04:24.953
Hey, Jackson. Check out
what I bought online. It's a pencil...

04:25.055 --> 04:27.717
and the eraser
is stuck up Bin Laden's pooper.

04:27.824 --> 04:29.792
Ha! Best 40 bucks I ever spent.

04:29.893 --> 04:32.521
- Wow. You're in a good mood today.
- You bet I am.

04:32.629 --> 04:34.995
- My kid's asking out a cheerleader.
- Steve?

04:35.098 --> 04:37.999
That's right. I tell you.
He's just like his old man.

04:38.101 --> 04:42.128
Hey, Marcus, check this out!
The eraser is stuck up Bin Laden's pooper!

04:44.441 --> 04:46.409
He thought it was funny too.

04:49.913 --> 04:53.007
There she is. Gentlemen,
if you'll excuse me...

04:53.116 --> 04:55.175
I have a fully
developed woman to conquer.

04:55.285 --> 04:57.549
Lisa Silver?
Dude, you're a madman.

04:57.654 --> 04:59.121
Thank you, Snot.

05:04.227 --> 05:08.254
It is a beautiful day for love, Toshi.
Thank you.

05:08.365 --> 05:11.926
- Steven! Steven! Steven!
- You're cool with chicks. You're cool with chicks.

05:14.037 --> 05:17.097
Hi, Lisa.
Did that hurt so good?

05:17.207 --> 05:19.937
It's Steve, Steve Smith.
Remember me?

05:20.043 --> 05:23.035
Ah, it'll come to ya.
Hey, you wanna go out Friday night?

05:23.146 --> 05:27.606
- It's okay, baby. I can handle this.
- Yeah, baby.

05:27.718 --> 05:31.518
How could she just reject me like-
like I was a nobody?

05:31.621 --> 05:33.953
- Hey. I love your dog.
- Thanks.

05:34.057 --> 05:36.116
Hey, wanna come back to my apartment
and pet my schnauzer?

05:36.226 --> 05:38.421
- Okay.
- And then we can play with this dog.

05:38.528 --> 05:41.588
Wait a minute.
That's it! I just need to get a dog...

05:41.698 --> 05:44.132
and women will
be all over my jock.

05:45.702 --> 05:48.603
In other news,
the White House was stunned today...

05:48.705 --> 05:51.299
when President Bush
received a phone call from God himself.

05:51.408 --> 05:53.501
Uh, hey, George. It's God.

05:53.610 --> 05:56.704
- Well, hey. How you doin'?
- Good. Good. Doin' good.

05:56.813 --> 06:01.011
Hey, listen. Big favor. Is there any way
that you could kind of, uh...

06:01.118 --> 06:06.055
from now on just sort of downplay
our relationship more in your public addresses?

06:06.156 --> 06:09.785
- What do you mean?
- Well, I mean, uh...

06:09.893 --> 06:11.861
to give you an example...

06:11.962 --> 06:15.227
All right. When you make comments like,
"God wanted me to be president."

06:15.332 --> 06:19.291
You know, that would be an example of maybe
something to just kind of keep to yourself.

06:19.403 --> 06:22.497
Just to kind of, like,
distance yourself from me a bit more.

06:22.606 --> 06:25.632
- Well, uh, sure. I mean, if you want.
- Great. Great. Thanks.

06:25.742 --> 06:29.838
Ooh. That's Cheney.
I gotta take it. Yes, sir?

06:29.946 --> 06:33.347
And on Wall Street today,
the Dow was down again.

06:33.450 --> 06:37.887
Ow! Dad, get off me!
I have to study for my term paper!

06:37.988 --> 06:40.923
- You know the procedure, Hayley.
- How come you never search Steve?

06:41.024 --> 06:43.822
Now, honey, I love you both,
but Steve is not a left-wing liberal...

06:43.927 --> 06:45.827
who I tried to raise properly
but somehow...

06:45.929 --> 06:48.397
- What's this?
- It's a pack of gum.

06:51.501 --> 06:53.492
All right. It's gum.

06:53.603 --> 06:55.662
Hey, champ.
When's your big date?

06:55.772 --> 06:59.264
- Um, she was out sick today.
- Well, that's all right. You'll get her tomorrow.

06:59.376 --> 07:02.368
Hey, listen.
Mom, Dad, can I have a dog?

07:02.479 --> 07:04.777
Absolutely not.
It's enough that we've got an alien...

07:04.881 --> 07:06.974
and a goldfish
with the brain of a German guy.

07:07.083 --> 07:11.019
Oh, Francine,
I can see your Schmutzklitzen.

07:11.121 --> 07:13.419
Sorry, Steve. No dog.

07:13.523 --> 07:16.151
- I'm more than happy to get you an Etch A Sketch.
- Mom.

07:16.259 --> 07:18.921
You know, Stan,
a dog's not such an awful idea.

07:19.029 --> 07:21.497
It might teach Steve
the responsibility he'll need...

07:21.598 --> 07:23.964
for when he, one day,
joins the army.

07:24.067 --> 07:26.900
- Are you seriously contemplating a military career?
- Thinking about it.

07:28.038 --> 07:31.235
Hey, did somebody
order a brand-new dog?

07:31.341 --> 07:34.674
Oh, sweet, Dad! You're the best!
What the hell is that?

07:34.778 --> 07:38.475
It's a dog.

07:38.582 --> 07:41.483
- Oh, my God.
- He can barely stand up.

07:41.585 --> 07:46.522
- Well, of course. He's 19.
- Stan, honey, didn't the pound
have any younger dogs?

07:46.623 --> 07:50.650
Francine, this dog has character.
He was around for the Reagan administration.

07:50.760 --> 07:53.160
He knows how things are supposed to be.

07:53.263 --> 07:55.424
Oh, damn it.
He's gonna pee! No, no, no, no!

07:55.532 --> 07:57.523
Nope. Just dust.

07:57.634 --> 08:00.330
Hey, dumb-ass!
Your dog's half dead!

08:00.437 --> 08:04.703
You hear that, boy? That girl talked to me,
and I didn't even have to talk to her first.

08:04.808 --> 08:07.709
Come on, Thor.
Let's go cruise the mall.

08:11.548 --> 08:14.108
Francine,
you are one lucky lady.

08:14.217 --> 08:16.777
You can do anything you want
to this body because you married it.

08:16.887 --> 08:19.856
I hope you're not taking
all this for granted.

08:19.956 --> 08:21.947
No potato chips.
No cupcakes.

08:22.058 --> 08:25.619
Damn it, Francine, I'm gonna
hawk a loogie in your Oil of Olay!

08:27.631 --> 08:30.225
- Where's your machete?
- Honey, take it easy.

08:30.333 --> 08:33.097
If I die, you must
protect the clan!

08:39.409 --> 08:42.400
Osama, is that you?

08:44.080 --> 08:46.480
Gee, Stan. What gives?

08:46.583 --> 08:50.212
Holy Toledo.
You killed your son's dog.

08:50.320 --> 08:53.016
And don't ask me to bring him back
with that E.T. finger thing...

08:53.123 --> 08:55.091
because that's
a giant load of crap.

08:57.060 --> 09:00.052
God, please watch over the soul
of this dead dog...

09:00.163 --> 09:03.792
and carry him up to heaven,
because he sure as hell can't walk.

09:03.900 --> 09:07.233
- He's dead. Amen.
- That was beautiful, honey.

09:07.337 --> 09:11.034
I used to have a dog
and legs and arms.

09:11.141 --> 09:15.737
I was an Olympic skier before the C.I.A.
switched mein brain with ein goldfish.

09:15.845 --> 09:19.906
What were we supposed to do?
Just let East Germany win that
gold medal? Not on my watch.

09:29.025 --> 09:34.156
Steve's dog would still be alive if you
right-wing lunatics would agree to gun control.

09:34.264 --> 09:37.290
You know what I have
to say to that?

09:37.400 --> 09:39.664
Ah. I thought
I was gonna fart.

09:39.769 --> 09:42.636
This sucks.
Now I'm never gonna get a girl.

09:42.739 --> 09:45.765
- Wait a minute. Is that why you wanted the dog?
- Yes, sir.

09:45.875 --> 09:48.343
Son, you don't need a dog
when your old dad...

09:48.445 --> 09:51.039
is the greatest ladies' man
of all time... come on!

09:53.917 --> 09:56.112
Now, Steve, girls love a guy
who can protect them.

09:56.219 --> 09:58.551
Now I'm gonna pretend I'm a thief
and snatch her purse.

09:58.655 --> 10:00.782
Then you'll chase me down,
tackle me and win her heart.

10:00.890 --> 10:03.518
- Got it?
- Got it, Dad.

10:03.627 --> 10:06.289
Oh, my God. My mom almost caught me
throwing up last night...

10:06.396 --> 10:08.990
- Hey! My purse!
- Don't worry, young lady!

10:09.099 --> 10:11.533
Hey, you!
Come back here!

10:21.678 --> 10:24.078
- Hey!
- Oh, no!

10:39.262 --> 10:41.526
Okay. I got a little carried away
back there.

10:49.539 --> 10:52.064
- Hey, Jeff.
- Hey, babe. Some guy at the restaurant...

10:52.175 --> 10:56.509
sent his meat loaf back because there was
a hair in it, but it's cool, because it was mine!

10:56.613 --> 10:59.377
- Picnic in the park?
- I can't. I have this paper due.

10:59.482 --> 11:01.609
Bummer. Well, you know
what Shakespeare said.

11:01.718 --> 11:04.346
I mean, I don't,
but I'm sure you do. See ya!

11:05.455 --> 11:07.753
Chillin' with Jeff.
Sounds like fun.

11:07.857 --> 11:10.849
- Yeah, but this is due tomorrow.
- Listen, Hayleykins.

11:10.960 --> 11:14.157
Obviously I can't leave the house,
but if you supply me with Twinkies...

11:14.264 --> 11:17.290
Ho Hos, you know,
any of your basic white trash foodstuffs...

11:17.400 --> 11:20.801
that your freakin' mother won't let me have,
I'll write your paper for you.

11:20.904 --> 11:24.203
- What do you know about Crime and Punishment?
- You mean, besides the fact...

11:24.307 --> 11:26.707
that the suffering of man
is both necessary and useful...

11:26.810 --> 11:29.870
which is revealed to us
during Raskolnikov's redemption?

11:29.979 --> 11:31.947
- Nothing.
- You got a deal.

11:32.048 --> 11:36.542
Sorry about that.
Once every seven hours, like clockwork.

11:38.221 --> 11:42.055
Oh, my God.
Dad, why is Hilary Duff in our house?

11:42.158 --> 11:45.719
Hilary is here of her own free will
because she wants to have dinner with Steve.

11:45.829 --> 11:49.128
- Hilary, could you pass the salt?
- Pass him the salt.

11:49.232 --> 11:52.099
So, as I was saying,
student body elections are next week...

11:52.202 --> 11:55.171
and I have personally
been wedgied by both candidates.

11:55.271 --> 11:58.399
Whoa. You hear that, Hilary?
Looks like you're a winner with Steve.

11:58.508 --> 12:00.601
Help me!

12:00.710 --> 12:04.077
Dad, you can't go around abducting people
just because you're C.I.A.

12:04.180 --> 12:06.080
Hilary, look out for the mines!

12:06.182 --> 12:08.116
What did I just say? You heard me.
What did I just say?

12:08.218 --> 12:10.652
- You said, "Look out for the mines."
- I said "Look out for the mines."

12:12.055 --> 12:15.456
I didn't have
this problem getting girls.

12:15.558 --> 12:18.493
A little observation, Stan.
Steve isn't like you.

12:18.595 --> 12:23.191
You're a big, powerful guy. Women are attracted
to power, and Steve just doesn't have any.

12:23.299 --> 12:25.859
That's it.
If Steve needs power...

12:25.969 --> 12:28.529
I'll rig the school election
and make him student body president.

12:28.638 --> 12:32.369
- Wow. Can you do that?
- Rigging elections is my bread and butter, Roger.

12:32.475 --> 12:35.273
You know how many votes George Bush
actually got in the first election?

12:35.378 --> 12:36.936
Seven.

12:38.448 --> 12:40.575
All right, Steve.
Now the key to fixing any election...

12:40.683 --> 12:42.651
is to cast doubt
on your opponent.

12:42.752 --> 12:46.586
Vote Shelly Maxwell for student body president.
Shelly for president.

12:46.689 --> 12:50.284
Sure, you can vote for Shelly Maxwell,
if you don't mind voting for a prostitute!

12:50.393 --> 12:53.453
- What?
- Don't play coy, you cardigan Jezebel!

12:53.563 --> 12:57.397
I have photographic evidence of you having
sexual relations with the Jack in the Box man.

12:59.936 --> 13:02.131
- The Jack in the Box man? He's not even human!
- That's sick!

13:02.238 --> 13:06.004
- Dad, is that really the Jack in the Box man?
- Yeah. He's in our basement.

13:12.916 --> 13:15.350
- You know, I got an "A" on that paper.
- My pleasure.

13:15.451 --> 13:18.511
- Got anything else in the pipeline?
- I've got a poli-sci paper.

13:18.621 --> 13:21.522
- You know anything about Henry Kissinger?
- All I know is he's Jewish...

13:21.624 --> 13:25.720
but if you get me some churros, I can
probably stretch that into about 12 pages.

13:31.901 --> 13:34.369
Hey, Steve. Congratulations.

13:34.470 --> 13:39.498
Why, thank you, Lisa. Say,
I was thinking, maybe you and I could...

13:39.609 --> 13:42.407
- Go out? I'd love to.
- Yes!

13:42.512 --> 13:46.312
Oh, my God!
Score, score, score, score, score!

13:46.416 --> 13:49.749
- Women love a man with power.
- You were right, Dad.

13:49.853 --> 13:51.912
Hey. Sorry to interrupt, Stan.

13:52.021 --> 13:56.117
- I was gonna take a shower, but we're
all out of Prell. You mind pickin' some up?
- Yeah, yeah.

13:56.226 --> 13:59.923
Thanks.
Oh, hey, Steve, kudos on the beeyatch.

14:00.029 --> 14:03.294
- Man, your stream is so powerful.
- Thanks.

14:03.399 --> 14:05.458
I wish your locker wasn't
right next to the boys' room.

14:05.568 --> 14:09.868
Yeah, me too.
Then again, I am student body president.

14:09.973 --> 14:12.771
Smith, what's the meaning of this?

14:12.876 --> 14:15.242
Principal Lewis,
I'm taking your office.

14:15.345 --> 14:19.475
Pursuant to Pearl Bailey High Statute 39-F,
quote, "The student body president...

14:19.582 --> 14:23.780
may acquisition any room on school premises
for the purpose of conducting school business."

14:23.887 --> 14:29.291
You can read! The system works!
I'll be back for my stuff.

14:29.392 --> 14:34.955
You're amazing, Steve. I'm gonna
go tell everyone we're going out.

14:36.332 --> 14:39.460
This is it.
I have absolute power.

14:39.569 --> 14:42.003
Doris, could you please
send in our high school mascot?

14:43.539 --> 14:46.235
Welcome, buffalo.
As you must have heard...

14:46.342 --> 14:48.242
I've been elected
student body president.

14:48.344 --> 14:50.539
As such,
I can do anything I want...

14:50.647 --> 14:53.445
and I want... to ride the buffalo!

14:53.549 --> 14:56.040
Yes! Yes!

14:56.152 --> 14:59.451
I'm riding the buffalo!

15:01.124 --> 15:03.490
Now send in the lunch lady.

15:06.729 --> 15:10.597
The lady's steak is not nearly
Salisbury enough. Take it back.

15:10.700 --> 15:13.225
Steve, you're the greatest boyfriend
I've ever had.

15:13.336 --> 15:15.930
My dear, I'm just getting started.
Bobby, get over here.

15:16.039 --> 15:19.065
I want my Shazam! shirt dry-cleaned
and pressed by third period.

15:19.175 --> 15:22.838
Oh, and another thing.
All periods will now be called "Steves."

15:22.946 --> 15:25.278
Hey, I'm thinkin' of
cuttin' third Steve. You in?

15:25.381 --> 15:28.179
- Yeah, as long as I'm back by fourth Steve.
- So if it's a statement...

15:28.284 --> 15:30.343
it should always
be followed by a Steve.

15:30.453 --> 15:33.388
Mr. Philips, may I be excused?
I'm having my Steve.

15:35.892 --> 15:38.452
Oh, Hayley, you are the best.

15:38.561 --> 15:43.055
Now what else we got here?
Chocodiles. Haven't tried those.

15:45.768 --> 15:49.226
Oh, my God!
How good are these!

15:49.339 --> 15:53.366
Dangerous.

15:53.476 --> 15:56.206
How's my paper comin', Roger?
You know, it's due tomorrow morning.

15:56.312 --> 15:59.509
- I got it under control, Hayley. Do not worry.
- Okay.

15:59.615 --> 16:03.244
By the way, Hayley.
Oh, my God. These Chocodiles.

16:03.353 --> 16:05.685
These Chocodiles, Hayley-
Oh, my God.

16:05.788 --> 16:07.688
These Chocodiles.
Oh, my God.

16:07.790 --> 16:12.693
- Um, yeah. They're good. Back to work.
- I'm on it.

16:20.703 --> 16:23.604
Oh, no. Hayley!

16:23.706 --> 16:27.142
Hayley! Hayley, wake up. I fell a sleep.
I had a sugar crash and I fell a sleep.

16:27.243 --> 16:30.440
- I didn't do the paper.
- What? It's due in two hours!

16:30.546 --> 16:34.949
I know. I'm a douche bag, but the important thing
now is to find a way to buy more time...

16:35.051 --> 16:38.282
Holy frijole. I got an idea.

16:38.388 --> 16:42.722
Well, under the circumstances, I think
we can give you another few days for your paper.

16:42.825 --> 16:44.793
Thank you, Mr. Goodwin.

16:48.197 --> 16:50.290
Hey, these chocolate lockers
were a great idea!

16:50.400 --> 16:53.801
- Mine has nut clusters. Thanks, Steve.
- No problem.

16:53.903 --> 16:57.134
I am a river to my people, and I hope
you're all enjoying the computer lab...

16:57.240 --> 16:59.174
now that I've
disabled the porn blocker.

16:59.275 --> 17:01.641
Yeah. I never knew
Todd's mom had a Web site.

17:01.744 --> 17:04.736
- Pretty sexy, huh, guys?
- Sure is, Todd.

17:04.847 --> 17:07.247
Oh, hello, gorgeous.

17:07.349 --> 17:10.944
- Ew. What are you doing?
- What? I'm kissing my woman.

17:11.054 --> 17:15.548
Steve, I like the perks of dating
the school president, but I'm not gonna kiss you.

17:15.657 --> 17:19.150
I mean, I'm beautiful,
and you're repulsive.

17:19.262 --> 17:23.425
- But- But I thought you liked me.
- Yeah. You were supposed to.

17:31.441 --> 17:33.909
There is a new school policy.

17:34.010 --> 17:37.241
Anyone caught holding hands,
hugging or swapping saliva...

17:37.346 --> 17:40.144
will be expelled from school
permanently.

17:41.551 --> 17:44.452
It's too risky right now.
I'll come back tonight.

17:44.554 --> 17:47.523
This is Stan Smith.

17:47.623 --> 17:50.183
Mr. Smith, I'm afraid
there's a problem with your son.

17:50.293 --> 17:52.420
Oh, God. He's gay.
This is it. This is the gay call.

17:52.528 --> 17:55.053
- I've been ready for this for years.
- Uh, no.

17:55.164 --> 17:57.359
It's just that
he's gone mad with power.

17:57.467 --> 18:01.096
He evacuated the entire school
and barricaded himself in my office.

18:01.204 --> 18:03.468
I see. Henry, antidote!

18:03.573 --> 18:07.634
Hey, how'd the dead dog work out?
Did it buy us some time?

18:07.743 --> 18:10.507
- Yeah. He gave me till Monday.
- Oh, great. Here's my list.

18:10.613 --> 18:14.174
Sorry, Roger. That was too close a call.
I'm gonna do my own work.

18:14.283 --> 18:17.275
Wha... But l..
Wh... Where am I gonna get my fix?

18:17.386 --> 18:19.786
- Not my problem.
- You can't do it alone, Hayley.

18:19.889 --> 18:22.915
You don't have the skills.
You're not smart enough.

18:23.025 --> 18:25.016
Somebody'll clean that up.

18:28.131 --> 18:32.329
- Steve, this is your father.
- Get out of here, Dad. I'm not comin' out.

18:32.435 --> 18:34.801
All right. I'm going in.
Francine, keep talking to him.

18:34.904 --> 18:38.305
- Be careful, honey.
- Hey, don't worry about me, kiddo.

18:38.407 --> 18:41.103
- Oh, oh. Oh, my God. Are you all right?
- I'm fine, honey. It's okay.

18:41.210 --> 18:43.872
- Oh, God. I just meant to brush you lightly.
- I know, sweetie. It's all right.

18:43.980 --> 18:46.540
- I guess I don't know my own strength.
- Go get Steve, honey.

18:46.649 --> 18:49.174
- Right.
- Steve, it's Mommy.

18:49.285 --> 18:51.685
Listen, honey.
You're not alone.

18:51.787 --> 18:55.689
When I was your age,
I had a huge crush on someone too..

18:55.791 --> 18:58.487
Mr. Feeny, my algebra teacher.

18:58.594 --> 19:02.052
Such a cute man with
a neat little beard.

19:02.165 --> 19:05.157
Of course, he didn't take me seriously,
but that all changed...

19:05.268 --> 19:07.759
when his wife found me
in their closet...

19:07.870 --> 19:11.533
cutting myself and
sniffing his T-shirts.

19:11.641 --> 19:15.168
- Dad, what are you doing?
- Stopping you from making a huge mistake.

19:15.278 --> 19:17.906
I lied
and told the police we were lovers.

19:18.014 --> 19:21.745
- He either killed himself, or he's in jail...
- Francine, for God's sake!

19:21.851 --> 19:24.217
I got him!
Wanna talk about it, champ?

19:24.320 --> 19:27.847
Dad, Lisa only liked me
because I was school president.

19:27.957 --> 19:31.518
She thinks I'm repulsive,
and the worst part of it is, she's right.

19:31.627 --> 19:36.360
Steve, I promise you, and this comes from
years of experience: Women are never right.

19:36.465 --> 19:39.559
I was crazy to think
any girl could ever like me.

19:39.669 --> 19:42.001
Look at me. I am repulsive.

19:42.104 --> 19:45.596
No, you're not. Look, Son. Roger was right.
You're not like me.

19:45.708 --> 19:49.735
You're not as good looking or as strong
or as smart or as good sexually.

19:49.845 --> 19:52.279
Oh, wait. He killed himself in jail.

19:52.381 --> 19:54.611
Damn it, Francine!
We're having a moment here!

19:54.717 --> 19:58.346
Listen, Son. I'm gonna show you something
I've never shown anyone before.

19:58.454 --> 20:01.548
- That's me when I was your age.
- Oh, my God! You were hideous!

20:01.657 --> 20:03.955
Well, I certainly wasn't the stallion
I am today.

20:04.060 --> 20:07.723
The point is, Steve, you'll be just fine,
because you're chock-full of potential.

20:07.830 --> 20:12.130
Wow. Thanks, Dad.
Aw, but I don't wanna face Lisa Silver.

20:12.235 --> 20:14.760
I got you covered.
Hello? I.N.S?

20:14.870 --> 20:18.601
Is this Nick? Hey, Nick.
It's Stan. Hey, what's goin' on?

20:18.708 --> 20:21.677
Hey, how'd that wiretap
on your wife work out?

20:21.777 --> 20:24.575
Oh. Oh. Sorry about that.

20:24.680 --> 20:27.114
But, hey, better with your brother
than some stranger, right?

20:27.216 --> 20:30.083
Yeah. Movin' on.
Movin' on. Right. Right.

20:30.186 --> 20:32.279
Say, listen,
could you do me a huge favor?

20:32.388 --> 20:36.484
You know the Silver family at 419 Elm?
Yeah. Let's deport them.

20:36.592 --> 20:38.617
You're the best, Dad.

20:40.830 --> 20:43.025
Great stew, Francine.

20:43.132 --> 20:46.363
The peas are like floating survivors
from a sunken beef ship.

20:46.469 --> 20:50.872
Steve, you're awfully quiet. Are you
still upset about what happened at school?

20:50.973 --> 20:54.636
I'm fine with that. I just wish
I was smoother with the ladies.

20:56.412 --> 21:00.348
Oh, okay, Melissa. So I'll meet you
at the arcade tomorrow after school.

21:00.449 --> 21:02.610
Bye. Thanks for the help, coach.

21:02.718 --> 21:05.278
My pleasure.
But if you expect to get any boob...

21:05.388 --> 21:08.357
I'm gonna need
a butt-load of Twinkies.

21:09.425 --> 21:12.087
Uh, "Gesundheit"?

21:44.226 --> 21:45.950
Have a great night.

21:45.950 --> 21:47.950
