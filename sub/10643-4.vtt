{\an1}you're--you're not.

18:46.375 --> 18:46.875
{\an1}It gets to the point, we're

18:46.959 --> 18:47.835

18:47.918 --> 18:48.460

{\an1}Yeah, you small as hell."

18:51.630 --> 18:52.506
{\an1}He says, "I'll be right back.

18:52.589 --> 18:53.340
{\an1}"I'm gonna get my tattoo

{\an1}"You know what? Go for it."

18:58.095 --> 18:58.637

18:59.346 --> 18:59.888
{\an1}He comes back.

19:01.348 --> 19:01.849
{\an1}He has all of his equipment.

19:01.932 --> 19:02.766

19:03.767 --> 19:04.893

19:04.977 --> 19:05.811
{\an1}in front of everybody.

19:05.894 --> 19:06.562
{\an1}And I just figured he had a

19:06.645 --> 19:07.563

19:07.646 --> 19:08.397
{\an1}with me.

19:08.480 --> 19:10.440
{\an1}But he proceeded to give me some

{\an1}sort of tattoo.

19:11.567 --> 19:13.402
{\an1}At the time, I had-I had no

19:21.994 --> 19:23.662
{\an1}I'm sure it's really a tattoo."

19:23.745 --> 19:24.371
{\an1}My friend told me the next

19:24.454 --> 19:25.914
{\an1}morning that it took about three

19:25.998 --> 19:26.623
{\an1}hours.

19:26.707 --> 19:27.291
{\an1}Me and my buddy are looking at

19:27.374 --> 19:29.251
{\an1}it, I'm like...

19:29.334 --> 19:32.421

19:34.548 --> 19:35.090

{\an1}been some sort of famous person.

19:36.717 --> 19:38.677
{\an1}So we type in Google.

19:39.219 --> 19:43.348
{\an1}And we look up bald...with, um,

{\an1}glasses.

19:44.558 --> 19:45.684
{\an1}And I look to my buddy Miles.

19:45.767 --> 19:46.935

19:54.818 --> 19:56.862
{\an1}"Seinfeld."

19:56.945 --> 19:57.446
{\an1}Why did he decide to put him?

19:57.529 --> 19:58.906
