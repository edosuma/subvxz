AND IT'S STILL THE ONLY
THING PEOPLE WANT ME

08:41.042 --> 08:42.347
I WANT--
I DON'T KNOW.

08:42.347 --> 08:43.610

OK, SO, UH...

09:18.688 --> 09:21.169
MIGHT HAVE GOTTEN
A LITTLE COLD HERE.

09:21.169 --> 09:25.826
YOU WANT PESTO
OR SUN-DRIED TOMATO
BASIL FUSILLI?

09:25.826 --> 09:28.437
I'VE DECIDED TO ANNUL
MY MARRIAGE TO WILL.

09:30.961 --> 09:33.485
HEH. SO NEITHER, THEN.

09:33.485 --> 09:36.445

SOME SALAD?

09:36.445 --> 09:38.099
I'M SERIOUS, BAILEY.

09:42.277 --> 09:45.367
OK...

09:45.367 --> 09:46.760
LET'S TALK
ABOUT THIS.

09:46.760 --> 09:49.414
YOU KNOW, YOU SHOULD HAVE
THOUGHT OF THAT SOONER.

09:50.241 --> 09:51.634
WHAT?

09:51.634 --> 09:53.636
THERE WAS A WHOLE LOT
TO TALK ABOUT, WASN'T THERE?

09:53.636 --> 09:57.248
BUT YOU DECIDED
TO KEEP IT ALL QUIET.

09:57.248 --> 09:59.468
WAIT. WHAT HAPPENED?

09:59.468 --> 10:01.513
YOU KNOW WHAT
THE SAD THING IS?

10:01.513 --> 10:04.342
IS EVEN THOUGH BOTH
ME AND WILL WERE LYING

10:04.342 --> 10:05.779
WHEN WE SAID THOSE VOWS,

10:05.779 --> 10:07.911
HE MEANT THAT STUFF
MORE THAN YOU DO.

10:07.911 --> 10:10.566
LOVE, HONOR, CHERISH--

10:10.566 --> 10:11.611
HOLLY--

10:11.611 --> 10:13.177
IT'S REALLY NICE
TO BE HONORED, BAILEY.

10:13.177 --> 10:14.222
TO BE TOLD THE TRUTH.

10:14.222 --> 10:17.181
I WAS--I WAS TRYING
TO PROTECT YOU, OK?

10:17.181 --> 10:18.443
I WAS TRYING
TO PROTECT BOTH OF YOU.

10:18.443 --> 10:19.488
YEAH, WELL, YOU DIDN'T.

10:19.488 --> 10:21.664
YOU JUST MADE IT
A THOUSAND TIMES WORSE,

10:21.664 --> 10:23.448
AND NOW I HAVE TO
BREAK UP THE MARRIAGE,

10:23.448 --> 10:24.667
AND PRAY THAT WILL
AND I DON'T GET CAUGHT.

10:24.667 --> 10:26.930
YOU KNOW YOU DON'T HAVE
TO DO THAT. YOU DON'T.

10:26.930 --> 10:28.149
SO, WHAT'S
THE ALTERNATIVE THEN?

10:28.149 --> 10:29.803
I MEAN, NOW THAT WE'RE
ACTUALLY TALKING ABOUT IT.

10:29.803 --> 10:33.154
OK, WELL, HANG ON.

10:33.154 --> 10:37.462
YOU--WE CAN STILL
KEEP THIS UNDER CONTROL.

10:37.462 --> 10:38.899
UNDER CONTROL?

10:38.899 --> 10:43.077
YOU MADE THINGS
UNBELIEVABLY PAINFUL
FOR BOTH ME AND WILL,

10:43.077 --> 10:44.252
NOT TO MENTION
YOU AND WILL.

10:44.252 --> 10:45.253
LISTEN--

10:45.253 --> 10:46.254
AND YOU LIED TO ME,
BAILEY!

10:46.254 --> 10:47.603
FORGET ABOUT
ME AND WILL, OK?

10:47.603 --> 10:48.604
FORGET ABOUT ALL
THAT OTHER STUFF--

10:48.604 --> 10:49.823
FORGET ABOUT IT?

10:49.823 --> 10:52.216
DO YOU WANT TO STAY
IN THIS COUNTRY OR NOT?

10:53.653 --> 10:55.742
DO YOU WANT TO GET THAT
DEGREE FROM STANFORD

10:55.742 --> 10:57.569
OR DON'T YOU?

10:59.659 --> 11:00.964
OF COURSE I DO.

11:00.964 --> 11:02.270
OK.

11:02.270 --> 11:03.706
WELL, THEN, YOU
FORGET ALL OF THAT
OTHER STUFF, OK?

11:03.706 --> 11:05.490
BECAUSE THIS IS
WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO.

11:05.490 --> 11:08.145
YOU HAVE TO STAY
MARRIED TO WILL.

11:09.320 --> 11:11.018
ALL RIGHT?

11:14.674 --> 11:16.153
HEY.
HI.

11:16.153 --> 11:18.199
I'M SORRY I'M LATE.

11:18.199 --> 11:19.853
DID I MISS HER?
IS SHE DOWN ALREADY?

11:19.853 --> 11:21.985
OH, SHE WENT DOWN
ABOUT AN HOUR AGO.

11:21.985 --> 11:23.813
MMM.

11:24.684 --> 11:26.163
I'M SO SORRY.

11:26.163 --> 11:28.731
BAILEY AND I HAD TO
FINISH UP THAT PITCH.

11:28.731 --> 11:31.691
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
I HAD SOME WORK TO DO, TOO.

11:31.691 --> 11:32.692
[SIGH]

11:32.692 --> 11:33.693
I BROUGHT DESSERT.

11:33.693 --> 11:35.303
AH...

11:35.303 --> 11:36.478
MMM.
HEH HEH.

11:36.478 --> 11:39.742
RUM RAISIN. OH, AND
CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIES?

11:39.742 --> 11:41.396
YEAH, IS IT TOO MUCH?

11:41.396 --> 11:42.397
NO...

11:42.397 --> 11:44.573
IT'S JUST...

11:44.573 --> 11:47.141
I KNOW IT'S PROBABLY
BAD LUCK TO SAY THIS,

11:47.141 --> 11:50.579
BUT I REALLY THINK THAT
WE'RE GONNA LAND THIS
NEW CLIENT.

11:50.579 --> 11:52.146
OH, IT SOUNDS GREAT.

11:52.146 --> 11:55.584
NOT THAT YOU NEED A REASON
TO SHOWER ME WITH DESSERTS,
BELIEVE ME.

11:55.584 --> 12:00.110
WELL, I'M PROBABLY GONNA
BE IN AFTER MIDNIGHT
THE NEXT COUPLE NIGHTS.

12:00.110 --> 12:03.374
OH, I SEE.
NOW IT'S MAKING SENSE.

12:03.374 --> 12:08.640
BUT I'LL BE HOME
EARLY NEXT WEEK,
I PROMISE.

12:08.640 --> 12:13.254
JUST PROMISE ME YOU'LL
SEND SOME RECENT PHOTOS
EVERY NOW AND AGAIN.

12:13.254 --> 12:15.386
[CELL PHONE RINGS]

12:15.386 --> 12:17.388
CHARLIE...

12:17.388 --> 12:18.389
GET IT.

12:18.389 --> 12:19.390
OK.

12:19.390 --> 12:21.566
GO AHEAD.

12:24.091 --> 12:25.875
YEAH?

12:27.877 --> 12:30.314
WAIT. WHEN?

12:30.314 --> 12:33.143
IS HE OK?

12:35.755 --> 12:38.105
OK, YEAH--
I'M ON MY WAY.

12:38.105 --> 12:42.326
YEAH, JUST TELL THEM
I'LL BE THERE. OK.

12:42.326 --> 12:43.327
WHAT?

12:43.327 --> 12:46.374
MITCH, MY...

12:46.374 --> 12:48.071
MY FOREMAN
JUST COLLAPSED
ON THE FLOOR.

12:48.071 --> 12:49.943
THEY TOOK HIM AWAY
IN AN AMBULANCE.

12:49.943 --> 12:51.466
OH, MY GOD, CHARLIE.

12:51.466 --> 12:54.121
THEY THINK
IT MIGHT BE HIS HEART.

12:54.121 --> 12:56.776
I, UH...

12:56.776 --> 12:58.734
GOTTA GET TO
THE HOSPITAL. OK?

13:09.353 --> 13:12.226
EXCUSE ME. I'M LOOKING
FOR MITCH GALLAGHER.

13:12.226 --> 13:13.357
THEY JUST
BROUGHT HIM IN.

13:13.357 --> 13:14.706
YOU A RELATIVE?

13:14.706 --> 13:17.884
NO. NO,
HE WORKS WITH ME.

13:17.884 --> 13:19.711
MR. GALLAGHER'S
IN SURGERY.

13:19.711 --> 13:21.409
THAT'S HIS WIFE
OVER THERE.

13:27.502 --> 13:29.025
MRS. GALLAGHER?

13:29.025 --> 13:30.026
YES?

13:30.026 --> 13:31.636
I'M...
CHARLIE SALINGER.

13:31.636 --> 13:33.247
I KNOW WHO YOU ARE.

13:33.247 --> 13:36.076
IS MITCH ALL RIGHT?
THE NURSE SAID THAT
HE WAS IN SURGERY.

13:36.076 --> 13:38.121
HE HAD A HEART ATTACK.

13:38.121 --> 13:41.255
THEY'RE TRYING TO FIND OUT
HOW MUCH DAMAGE IT DID.

13:47.130 --> 13:49.437
HE HAD A PRE-EXISTING
CONDITION.

13:49.437 --> 13:51.874
MITCH NEVER TOLD YOU
ABOUT THAT, DID HE?

13:51.874 --> 13:54.181
NO. NO, HE NEVER
SAID A WORD.

13:54.181 --> 13:57.140
NO, OF COURSE NOT.

13:57.140 --> 13:59.142
HE DIDN'T WANT
TO WORRY YOU.

14:00.665 --> 14:02.624
LISTEN, IS THERE
ANYTHING THAT I CAN DO?

14:02.624 --> 14:04.278
ANYTHING?

14:05.975 --> 14:09.196
I BEGGED HIM
TO SLOW DOWN.

14:09.196 --> 14:12.939
14-HOUR DAYS,
6 DAYS A WEEK...

14:12.939 --> 14:14.810
BUT HE KEPT ON
TELLIN' ME,

14:14.810 --> 14:16.856
JUST HANG IN,
JUST A LITTLE MORE TIME.

14:16.856 --> 14:18.727
WE'RE REALLY BUILDIN'
SOMETHIN' HERE.

14:20.990 --> 14:24.515
CHARLIE'S GOT
PLANS FOR THIS PLACE.

14:28.389 --> 14:30.608
I DON'T KNOW IF
PROFESSOR SHAW TOLD YOU,

14:30.608 --> 14:34.047
BUT GODDESSIS NOT
YOUR TRADITIONAL
WOMEN'S MAGAZINE.

14:34.047 --> 14:37.572
IN FACT, IT'S NOT
STRICTLY A WOMAN'S
MAGAZINE AT ALL,

14:37.572 --> 14:42.533
DESPITE THE FACT THAT
WE COVER WOMEN'S ISSUES,
FASHION, HAIR, MAKE-UP--

14:42.533 --> 14:44.709
IT IS CALLED
GODDESS,AFTER ALL.

14:44.709 --> 14:48.061
WHICH, TO US,
MEANS NOT COMPROMISING.

14:48.061 --> 14:50.367
WE DON'T NEED TO BE
ALL THINGS TO ALL PEOPLE.

14:50.367 --> 14:53.370
WE WANT TO SHOCK,
WE WANT TO INTRIGUE,

14:53.370 --> 14:55.546
BUT BY ACTUALLY
SAYING SOMETHING.

14:55.546 --> 14:56.547
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

14:56.547 --> 14:58.941
SURE. I CAN'T
WAIT TO READ IT.

14:58.941 --> 15:02.118
ACTUALLY, I WAS HOPING
YOU'D WRITE IT.

15:02.118 --> 15:03.598
I'M SORRY?

15:03.598 --> 15:04.947
JULIA, I READ YOUR BOOK,

15:04.947 --> 15:07.428
AND I THINK YOUR
VOICE WOULD BE PERFECT
FOR THE MAGAZINE.

15:07.428 --> 15:09.734
HOW DO YOU MEAN?

15:09.734 --> 15:11.998
I WAS THINKING
MAYBE A MONTHLY COLUMN.

15:11.998 --> 15:14.783
SAY, 500 WORDS
ON THE SUBJECT
OF YOUR CHOICE.

15:14.783 --> 15:16.219
HOW'S THAT SOUND?

15:16.219 --> 15:17.612
UH...

15:17.612 --> 15:19.919
WELL, I THOUGHT
I WAS JUST APPLYING
FOR AN INTERNSHIP--

15:19.919 --> 15:22.747
THE TRUTH IS,
WE'VE BEEN LOOKING
FOR SOMEBODY YOUR AGE,

15:22.747 --> 15:24.097
WITH YOUR POINT OF VIEW.

15:24.097 --> 15:28.014
SO, I WANT YOU
TO GO HOME RIGHT NOW
AND TRY ONE FOR ME.

15:28.014 --> 15:30.625
WE BASICALLY
GO TO PRESS ANY MINUTE,

15:30.625 --> 15:31.931
BUT WE'LL WAIT FOR YOU.

15:32.757 --> 15:34.934
OK.

15:41.375 --> 15:42.767
HEY.

15:42.767 --> 15:44.421
I CAME AS SOON
AS I GOT YOUR MESSAGE.

15:44.421 --> 15:46.249
HOW'S HE DOIN'?

15:46.249 --> 15:48.034
HE'S STILL UNCONSCIOUS.

15:48.034 --> 15:50.297
THEY SAID IT WAS
A PRETTY SEVERE ATTACK,

15:50.297 --> 15:52.995
AND THEY FOUND
SOME PROBLEMS WITH
THE WALL OF HIS HEART...

15:52.995 --> 15:54.779
AND MIGHT HAVE
TO GO BACK IN.

15:54.779 --> 15:57.739
OH, MAN.

15:57.739 --> 15:59.436
LISTEN, UM...

15:59.436 --> 16:01.221
I JUST WANT TO BE HERE
WHEN HE WAKES UP.

16:01.221 --> 16:02.396
AND I KNOW YOU'RE REALLY
SWAMPED RIGHT NOW,

16:02.396 --> 16:03.440
BUT I YOU COULD
MAYBE JUST--

16:03.440 --> 16:06.530
I'M ALREADY ON IT.
DON'T WORRY.

16:06.530 --> 16:09.011
UM...BUT...CHARLIE,

16:09.011 --> 16:11.796
TOMMY TOLD ME ABOUT
YOU CUTTING BACK
THE SCHEDULE.

16:11.796 --> 16:15.148
THAT'S RIGHT.

16:15.148 --> 16:17.280
OK, LISTEN, I KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE THINKIN' HERE, OK?

16:17.280 --> 16:19.152
BUT WE DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS.

16:19.152 --> 16:21.806
WHAT HAPPENED WITH MITCH,
IT'S...A FLUKE THING.

16:21.806 --> 16:23.417
I DON'T CARE.
I DON'T CARE.

16:23.417 --> 16:25.158
ALL RIGHT, I'M MAKIN'
SOME CHANGES.

16:25.158 --> 16:26.811
I'VE BEEN
PUSHIN' TOO HARD.

16:26.811 --> 16:28.465
BUT WE'RE GONNA
FALL BEHIND.

16:28.465 --> 16:30.815
WE DON'T WANT WORD
GETTING OUT THAT
WE'RE BEHIND,

16:30.815 --> 16:32.121
ESPECIALLY WHEN WE'RE
MEETING WITH KIMBALL--

16:32.121 --> 16:33.122
I CANCELLED
THAT MEETING.

16:33.122 --> 16:35.690
OH, WAIT. WHAT?

16:35.690 --> 16:39.172
BAILEY, WE CAN'T HANDLE
ALL THIS NEW BUSINESS
RIGHT NOW,

16:39.172 --> 16:40.956
AND I'M NOT GONNA
DO THAT TO MY GUYS.

16:40.956 --> 16:43.654
OK, CHARLIE,
LISTEN TO ME.

16:43.654 --> 16:44.829
I KNOW THAT
THIS IS HARD.

16:44.829 --> 16:47.049
OK, I KNOW THAT,
AND WE ALL FEEL BAD,

16:47.049 --> 16:50.052
BUT YOU CAN'T JUST
GIVE UP ON THIS STUFF NOW.

16:50.052 --> 16:51.488
SO, PLEASE,
THINK THIS THROUGH.

16:51.488 --> 16:53.534
I HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT IT.

16:53.534 --> 16:55.275
ALL RIGHT?
AND I'M DOIN' THIS.

16:55.275 --> 16:57.364
THAT'S IT.

17:07.330 --> 17:09.332
OK...

17:09.332 --> 17:10.377
YOU FIRST.

17:10.377 --> 17:11.334
YOU GO.

17:11.334 --> 17:13.684
NO, YOU.
PLEASE?

17:13.684 --> 17:16.557
OK,
BUT WE TAKE TURNS.

17:16.557 --> 17:18.689
BAD NEWS FIRST.

17:18.689 --> 17:21.344
SO, NO FROM
WOODBRIDGE.

17:21.344 --> 17:23.433
WAIT-LISTED
AT WOODBRIDGE.

17:23.433 --> 17:24.913
OK, WE HATE WOODBRIDGE.

17:24.913 --> 17:29.135
SO...YES FROM
SAN FRANCISCO, BUT...

17:29.135 --> 17:31.311
IT'S A SAFETY COLLEGE,
SO WHATEVER.

17:31.311 --> 17:32.790
YOU?

17:32.790 --> 17:35.315
YES FROM STANFORD.

17:35.315 --> 17:37.317
CLAUDIA, THAT'S AMAZING.

17:39.188 --> 17:41.234
AND YES FROM JULLIARD.

17:42.365 --> 17:43.714
YOU GOT IN?

17:43.714 --> 17:46.630
YOU GOT INTO
JULLIARD?

17:46.630 --> 17:48.023
CLAUDIA--

17:48.023 --> 17:50.156
I KNOW.

17:50.156 --> 17:51.983
YOU'RE GOIN'
TO JULLIARD.

17:51.983 --> 17:54.508
NO, STOP, I'M NOT.

17:54.508 --> 17:56.466
WHAT? WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

17:56.466 --> 17:57.685
I MEAN, HOW COULD
YOU NOT GO?

17:57.685 --> 17:59.339
BECAUSE, I MEAN,
I ONLY AUDITIONED

17:59.339 --> 18:00.905
JUST TO SEE
IF I COULD GET IN.

18:00.905 --> 18:03.734
YEAH, BUT YOU DID.
YOU GOT IN.

18:03.734 --> 18:04.866
IT'S EXPENSIVE.

18:04.866 --> 18:07.216
I MEAN, AT LEAST STANFORD
IS CLOSE TO HOME.

18:07.216 --> 18:09.914
YOU KNOW, I COULD--
I COULD SAVE MONEY
BY LIVING AT HOME,

18:09.914 --> 18:12.526
AND I WOULDN'T
HAVE TO BUY TICKETS
BACK AND FORTH TO NEW YORK.

18:12.526 --> 18:14.658
CLAUDIA--

18:14.658 --> 18:17.705
I KNOW.

18:17.705 --> 18:20.664
BUT IT WOULD MEAN
LEAVING MY FAMILY...

18:21.491 --> 18:23.667
AND YOU.

18:28.150 --> 18:30.239
WE ROTATE OUR PEOPLE
THROUGH THE PRODUCT LINE
ALL THE TIME.

18:30.239 --> 18:31.936
THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT
TO CHARLIE.

18:31.936 --> 18:34.374
IT KEEPS EVERYONE OPEN
TO NEW WAYS OF IMPROVING
THE PROCESS.

18:34.374 --> 18:35.418
VERY SMART.

18:35.418 --> 18:38.987
SO, TO TAKE UP THE SLACK
LEFT BY AMBRUSO,

18:38.987 --> 18:40.858
THAT REALLY WOULDN'T
BE A PROBLEM AT ALL,
MR. KIMBALL.

18:40.858 --> 18:42.033
YOU MAKE A GOOD PITCH.

18:42.033 --> 18:44.035
WHAT ABOUT CHARLIE?

18:44.035 --> 18:45.994
DO WE NEED TO TALK?

18:45.994 --> 18:47.430
UH, ABOUT WHAT?

18:47.430 --> 18:49.389
WELL, I HEARD FROM
THE BOYS AT BAXTER

18:49.389 --> 18:50.868
THAT YOU WERE
SLOWING THINGS DOWN.

18:50.868 --> 18:54.263
YOUR BROTHER SAID
THEY COULD EXPECT
SOME DELAYS.

18:54.263 --> 18:57.440
RIGHT, SEE,
WHAT HAPPENED WAS,

18:57.440 --> 19:00.008
WE HAD A GUY
ON THE FLOOR GET SICK.

19:00.008 --> 19:01.792
SO CHARLIE'S
NOT TAKING ANY CHANCES.

19:01.792 --> 19:05.274
WHICH, FRANKLY,
THAT'S WHY OUR GUYS
WORK AS HARD AS THEY DO.

19:05.274 --> 19:07.972
BECAUSE CHARLIE TREATS
EVERYONE AROUND HERE
LIKE FAMILY.

19:07.972 --> 19:10.018
SO, AS SOON AS
WE'RE BACK ONLINE,

19:10.018 --> 19:12.412
WE'LL BE CRANKING
THINGS OUT AT 110%.

19:12.412 --> 19:14.675
I GET THE FEELING
YOU COULD SELL ANYTHING.

19:14.675 --> 19:16.633
THAT'S A COMPLIMENT.

19:16.633 --> 19:18.461
SO, WHAT ARE YOU,
JUST OUT OF COLLEGE?

19:18.461 --> 19:19.810
NO, NEVER GRADUATED.

19:19.810 --> 19:22.596
DROPPED OUT EARLY TO HELP
WITH THE FAMILY BUSINESS?

19:22.596 --> 19:23.727
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

19:23.727 --> 19:25.729
EVER GIVE ANY THOUGHT
TO GOING BACK,

19:25.729 --> 19:27.166
MAYBE GETTING
A BUSINESS DEGREE?

19:27.166 --> 19:32.954
UH, SURE, A LITTLE.
A LOT...ACTUALLY. WHY?

19:32.954 --> 19:35.826
IF IT'S SOMETHING
YOU'RE INTERESTED IN,

19:35.826 --> 19:36.784
YOU SHOULD CALL ME.

19:36.784 --> 19:39.352
I RECRUIT FOR
MY B-SCHOOL BACK EAST.

19:39.352 --> 19:41.615
THEY LOVE GUYS LIKE YOU
WITH EXPERIENCE.

19:41.615 --> 19:44.139
YOU WORK REALLY HARD,
GO TO SUMMER SCHOOL, TOO,

19:44.139 --> 19:45.880
HAVE A DEGREE
IN A COUPLE OF YEARS.

19:45.880 --> 19:48.187
AND THEN...
THE SKY'S THE LIMIT.

19:48.187 --> 19:50.580
WITH THIS ECONOMY
THESE DAYS,

19:50.580 --> 19:53.757
YOU CAN'T AFFORD
NOT TO THINK BIG.

19:59.110 --> 20:00.547
HEY, HEY, HEY.

20:00.547 --> 20:02.331
HEY.

20:03.202 --> 20:04.203
HMM?

20:04.203 --> 20:05.465
YOU LOOK NICE.

20:05.465 --> 20:08.163
THANK YOU. YOU, TOO,
IN THAT SORT OF

20:08.163 --> 20:11.122
I'M-NOT-REALLY-READY-
TO-GO-TO-DINNER WAY.

20:11.122 --> 20:13.429
OH, MY GOD. DINNER.

20:13.429 --> 20:15.779
OH, I'M SO SORRY.
I TOTALLY SPACED.

20:15.779 --> 20:17.477
I JUST CAME RIGHT HOME
AND STARTED WRITING.

20:17.477 --> 20:18.478
YEAH, WHAT?

20:18.478 --> 20:19.522
YEAH.

20:19.522 --> 20:21.002
YOU DOIN' YOUR SPEECH
FOR THE CONFERENCE?

20:21.002 --> 20:23.874
NO. ACTUALLY,
I HAD TO CALL MAGGIE
AND SAY I COULDN'T DO IT.

20:23.874 --> 20:25.485
REALLY? WHY?

20:25.485 --> 20:27.791
BECAUSE I HAD THE MOST
AMAZING INTERVIEW

20:27.791 --> 20:29.445
AT GODDESSMAGAZINE
TODAY.

20:29.445 --> 20:31.447
YEAH? GODDESS?
THAT'S WHAT IT'S CALLED?

20:31.447 --> 20:33.449
JUSTIN, THE EDITOR
LOVED MY BOOK.

20:33.449 --> 20:35.321
SHE OFFERED ME
A MONTHLY COLUMN.

20:35.321 --> 20:37.236
MY OWN MONTHLY COLUMN.

20:37.236 --> 20:38.411
WELL--JULIA,
THAT'S--REALLY?

20:38.411 --> 20:39.977
I KNOW. YEAH!

20:39.977 --> 20:41.327
WOW. ALL RIGHT.
WELL, COME ON.

20:41.327 --> 20:43.851
LET'S--GET DRESSED.
RESERVATIONS ARE 8:30.

20:43.851 --> 20:44.808
WE GOTTA CELEBRATE.

20:44.808 --> 20:46.070
NO, NO, NO, I CAN'T.

20:46.070 --> 20:47.333
I HAVE TO DO THIS COLUMN
FOR TOMORROW.

20:47.333 --> 20:49.204
I WANT TO MAKE IT
ORIGINAL, YOU KNOW?

20:49.204 --> 20:51.250
COME ON,
A GIRL'S GOTTA EAT.

20:51.250 --> 20:52.773
OH, WELL, CAN'T WE
CELEBRATE TOMORROW?

20:52.773 --> 20:53.774
NO, WE CAN'T.

20:53.774 --> 20:56.037
WE'RE HAVING DINNER
WITH MY PARENTS,

20:56.037 --> 20:57.865
AND THEN I HAVE TO GO BACK
TO NEW HAVEN THE NEXT DAY.

20:57.865 --> 20:59.432
WELL, THEN, WE'LL
CELEBRATE WITH THEM.

20:59.432 --> 21:01.085
[SIGH]

21:01.085 --> 21:04.175
JUSTIN, I'M SORRY.
IT'S JUST THIS
IS SO EXCITING FOR ME.

21:04.175 --> 21:05.351
I'VE BEEN WANTING
SOMETHING NEW,

21:05.351 --> 21:06.569
AND THIS COULD BE IT.

21:10.530 --> 21:13.402
ALL RIGHT. FINE.
YOU'RE THE GODDESS.

21:13.402 --> 21:15.535
WE'LL HAVE FUN TOMORROW.
I PROMISE.

21:15.535 --> 21:16.536
OK.

21:16.536 --> 21:17.841
OK.

21:27.547 --> 21:28.548
HEY.

21:28.548 --> 21:30.376
WHAT THE HELL'S
GOIN' ON, WILL?

21:30.376 --> 21:31.464
LOOK, TAKE IT EASY,
ALL RIGHT?

21:31.464 --> 21:32.726
TAKE IT EASY?!

21:32.726 --> 21:34.031
YOU KNOW WHAT IT
TOOK ME TO FIND YOU?

21:34.031 --> 21:35.163
HUH?

21:35.163 --> 21:36.860
YOU MOVE OUT
OF MY HOUSE,

21:36.860 --> 21:37.948
YOU TAKE ALL YOUR STUFF
OUT OF HOLLY'S

21:37.948 --> 21:39.689
WITHOUT A WORD TO ME,
NOT A WORD.

21:39.689 --> 21:42.605
AND THEN I CALL
YOUR OFFICE, AND THEY
TELL ME THAT YOU QUIT.

21:42.605 --> 21:44.390
SO WHY DON'T YOU
TELL ME WHAT THE HELL'S
GOIN' ON?

21:44.390 --> 21:46.130
WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE?

21:46.130 --> 21:47.958
IT LOOKS LIKE
YOU'RE BAILING ON ME.

21:47.958 --> 21:49.786
IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE
PULLIN' UP THE STAKES,

21:49.786 --> 21:51.135
AND YOU ARE
RUINING EVERYTHING.

21:51.135 --> 21:54.138
LOOK, HOLLY KNOWS
WHAT I'M DOING, OK?
SHE UNDERSTANDS.

21:54.138 --> 21:55.792
SHE'S GONNA
BE DEPORTED, WILL!

21:55.792 --> 21:59.927
BAILEY, SHE KNOWS.
OK? JUST SEEING HER,
IT'S HUMILIATING.

21:59.927 --> 22:01.102
I DON'T CARE.

22:01.102 --> 22:02.103
WHAT?

22:02.103 --> 22:03.452
WILL, YOU TOOK AN OATH.

22:03.452 --> 22:04.627
YOU DON'T CARE?

22:04.627 --> 22:06.847
IS THAT WHAT
YOU JUST SAID?

22:06.847 --> 22:10.111
THAT--LOOK,
I DON'T MEAN THAT. OK?

22:10.111 --> 22:12.809
YES, YOU DO!
YOU DO!

22:12.809 --> 22:16.335
IF YOU WERE HONESTLY
ASKING ME TO STAY THERE,
AFTER EVERYTHING I TOLD YOU,

22:16.335 --> 22:18.467
THEN THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT
YOU MEAN. YOU DON'T CARE!

22:18.467 --> 22:19.816
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
HER FUTURE.

22:19.816 --> 22:21.862
WILL, WE'RE TALKING
ABOUT HER WHOLE LIFE!

22:21.862 --> 22:22.950
NO, WE'RE NOT!

22:22.950 --> 22:24.517
ASK HOLLY.

22:24.517 --> 22:27.084
COME ON, THERE'S OTHER
MED SCHOOLS, BAILEY.

22:27.084 --> 22:29.826
THERE'S SCHOOLS IN CANADA
WHERE SHE'D BE A 2-HOUR
PLANE FLIGHT AWAY.

22:29.826 --> 22:31.132
IF YOU'D ACTUALLY
TALK TO HER--

22:31.132 --> 22:32.133
WHOA, HANG ON A SECOND.

22:32.133 --> 22:33.830
DON'T YOU TURN THIS
AROUND ON ME.

22:33.830 --> 22:35.179
YOU MADE A PROMISE!

22:35.179 --> 22:37.225
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M BREAKING IT!

22:37.225 --> 22:39.314
OK?

22:39.314 --> 22:41.664
I'M BREAKIN' THE DEAL.

22:41.664 --> 22:44.363
AND YOU NEED
TO ASK YOURSELF,

22:44.363 --> 22:47.931
WHAT THE HELL
IS WRONG WITH YOU?

22:47.931 --> 22:50.412
WHY YOU KEEP
PUSHING AND PUSHING
AND PUSHING THIS THING

22:50.412 --> 22:52.893
WHEN NOBODY ELSE WANTS IT.

22:52.893 --> 22:55.069
WHY EVERYBODY ELSE
IS READY TO LET GO,

22:55.069 --> 22:58.115
BUT YOU'RE STILL
HANGING ON.

23:10.127 --> 23:11.172
DON'T GET ME WRONG,

23:11.172 --> 23:12.173
I THINK IT'S
A WONDERFUL PIECE,

23:12.173 --> 23:14.567
AND I LOVE
THE CENTRAL IDEA--

23:14.567 --> 23:17.221
HOW WE AS WOMEN
ARE CONSTANTLY STRIVING
TO REINVENT OURSELVES,

23:17.221 --> 23:18.962
TO START OVER, BUT--

23:18.962 --> 23:22.009
YOU WANT ME
TO START OVER.

23:22.009 --> 23:24.272
IT'S JUST A LITTLE
ABSTRACT RIGHT NOW,

23:24.272 --> 23:26.361
A LITTLE TOO MUCH
ABOUT THE IDEA.

23:26.361 --> 23:29.799
BUT IF YOU COULD
SELL IT WITH SOME
CONCRETE EXAMPLES,

23:29.799 --> 23:31.192
MADONNA'S
AN OBVIOUS CHOICE...

23:31.192 --> 23:33.673
COURTNEY LOVE,
BRITNEY SPEARS.

23:33.673 --> 23:36.371
SO, FROM A MORE
POP CULTURE ANGLE?

23:36.371 --> 23:37.677
EXACTLY...

23:37.677 --> 23:40.593
AND HOW OUR READERS
CAN RELATE TO THOSE
GODDESSES,

23:40.593 --> 23:42.377
WAYS THEY CAN
REINVENT THEMSELVES.

23:42.377 --> 23:44.771
A NEW LOOK,
A NEW HAIRSTYLE,

23:44.771 --> 23:48.296
HOW EVEN A NEW LIPSTICK
CAN MAKE YOU FEEL LIKE
A DIFFERENT PERSON.

23:48.296 --> 23:49.471
LIPSTICK?

23:49.471 --> 23:51.734
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

23:51.734 --> 23:53.693
WELL, NO, I'M NOT SURE
THAT I DO.

23:53.693 --> 23:56.391
I MEAN, THIS SHOULDN'T
BE A HOW-TO, SHOULD IT?

23:56.391 --> 23:57.784
SHOULDN'T IT
BE MORE OF A WHY?

23:57.784 --> 24:00.439
IT COULD BE BOTH,
RIGHT?

24:00.439 --> 24:02.484
WELL, IT COULD--

24:02.484 --> 24:04.486
I'M SORRY,
I GUESS I JUST THOUGHT

24:04.486 --> 24:07.184
YOU WANTED MORE
OF AN ESSAY FROM
MY POINT OF VIEW.

24:07.184 --> 24:10.797
LOOK, WE HAVE
A MAGAZINE TO SELL.

24:10.797 --> 24:13.277
IF YOU CAN DO THAT
AND GET YOUR POINT
OF VIEW ACROSS,

24:13.277 --> 24:15.715
SO MUCH THE BETTER,
RIGHT?

24:15.715 --> 24:17.847
RIGHT.

24:34.385 --> 24:35.386
HEY.

24:35.386 --> 24:37.301
HI.

24:40.566 --> 24:42.611
HOW YA FEELIN'?

24:42.611 --> 24:47.094
WELL, I WON'T LIE.
I'VE BEEN BETTER.

24:47.094 --> 24:51.228
IT'S A HELL OF A WAY
TO SCORE A DAY OFF.

24:51.228 --> 24:52.882
THE GUYS SENT THIS OVER.

24:52.882 --> 24:54.231
THANKS.

24:54.231 --> 24:55.276
THEY ALL SIGNED IT.

24:55.276 --> 24:57.104
YEAH. HEY, TELL 'EM
NO SLACKIN' OFF,

24:57.104 --> 24:59.498
OR I'LL
COME DOWN THERE AND
KICK SOMEBODY'S BUTT.

25:01.935 --> 25:03.589
I CALLED
THE INSURANCE COMPANY,

25:03.589 --> 25:06.983
AND YOU'RE
COMPLETELY COVERED,

25:06.983 --> 25:10.378
AND YOUR SALARY'S
GUARANTEED,

25:10.378 --> 25:13.381
AND IF THERE'S ANYTHING
THAT YOUR FAMILY NEEDS--

25:13.381 --> 25:15.514
YOU REALLY WANT
TO HELP ME?

25:15.514 --> 25:18.517
THEN TELL ME WHY YOU'RE
SLOWIN' THE LINE DOWN.

25:18.517 --> 25:20.954
WHAT? HOW DID YOU--

25:20.954 --> 25:24.435
I CALLED
TOMMY TO CATCH UP,
AND HE MENTIONED IT.

25:24.435 --> 25:26.525
OH, MITCH...

25:26.525 --> 25:28.396
YOU HAD A HEART ATTACK.

25:28.396 --> 25:30.485
LET'S JUST WORRY ABOUT
YOU GETTING BETTER.

25:30.485 --> 25:32.879
I WORKED MY ASS OFF
TO GET THAT LINE
UP AND RUNNING.

25:32.879 --> 25:36.491
YOU--YOU THINK I WANT
YOU UNDOING ALL THAT?

25:36.491 --> 25:38.188
JUST RELAX.

25:38.188 --> 25:40.321
THIS IS NOT SOMETHING
THAT YOU SHOULD BE
STRESSING OUT ABOUT.

25:40.321 --> 25:45.195
CHARLIE, YOUR PUSHING ME
DIDN'T GIVE ME
THIS HEART ATTACK.

25:45.195 --> 25:49.025
I PUSHED MYSELF BECAUSE
I WANT THE SAME THINGS
THAT YOU WANT.

25:49.025 --> 25:51.637
I WANT SOMETHING TO COME
FROM THE WORK THAT I DO,

25:51.637 --> 25:55.597
SOMETHING THAT'S
BIG ENOUGH TO LAST
FOR MY FAMILY AND ME.

25:55.597 --> 25:57.599
MY WIFE DOESN'T
UNDERSTAND THAT.

25:57.599 --> 26:01.342
MAYBE--MAYBE YOURS
DOESN'T, EITHER, BUT...

26:01.342 --> 26:05.215
THAT'S WHY WE DO
WHAT WE DO, ISN'T IT?

26:23.930 --> 26:26.367
WAIT.

26:26.367 --> 26:29.022
WHAT'S UP?

26:29.022 --> 26:31.851
I'VE BEEN THINKING
ABOUT IT, AND...

26:35.855 --> 26:37.247
I WANT TO.

26:37.247 --> 26:39.162
REALLY?

26:39.162 --> 26:41.425
YES.

26:47.040 --> 26:49.608
JUST ONE SECOND.

27:00.009 --> 27:02.055
WHAT?

27:03.099 --> 27:04.623
UH, WAIT.

27:04.623 --> 27:08.714
YOU THOUGHT
ABOUT THIS TODAY?

27:08.714 --> 27:11.891
YEAH.

27:11.891 --> 27:12.892
WHY?

27:12.892 --> 27:17.374
JUST...YOU HAVE
TO DECIDE ABOUT COLLEGE.

27:17.374 --> 27:20.029
THIS GIANT DECISION...

27:20.029 --> 27:22.597
AND YOU THOUGHT
ABOUT THIS?

27:22.597 --> 27:24.338
TODD,
I DON'T UNDERSTAND--

27:24.338 --> 27:26.949
YOU WEREN'T READY
TO DO THIS FOR SO LONG,

27:26.949 --> 27:28.690
AND THEN
ALL OF A SUDDEN,

27:28.690 --> 27:30.866
THE DAY
AFTER YOU FIND OUT
YOU GOT INTO JULLIARD--

27:30.866 --> 27:32.389
OH, WAIT. HOLD ON.

27:32.389 --> 27:38.482
I'M SORRY, I JUST DON'T
WANT OUR FIRST TIME
TO BE OUT OF GUILT.

27:38.482 --> 27:39.875
GUILT?

27:39.875 --> 27:42.878
I TOLD YOU, TODD,

27:42.878 --> 27:45.838
I'M NOT GONNA GO THERE.

27:45.838 --> 27:47.535
YEAH, BUT...

27:47.535 --> 27:49.406
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU.

27:51.495 --> 27:55.325
I MEAN, IF YOU CAN
HONESTLY TELL ME THAT
YOU DON'T WANT TO GO...

28:00.461 --> 28:02.376
I DIDN'T THINK SO.

28:09.252 --> 28:10.253
[SIGH]

28:10.253 --> 28:11.298
[FOOTSTEPS]

28:11.298 --> 28:12.734
BAILEY, CLAUD,
HELLO?

28:12.734 --> 28:15.432
NO, IT'S ME.

28:15.432 --> 28:16.956
REMEMBER ME?

28:16.956 --> 28:18.131
VAGUELY.

28:18.131 --> 28:20.350
YOU LOOK LIKE THIS GUY
I DATED IN HIGH SCHOOL.

28:20.350 --> 28:22.483
ONLY CUTER.

28:22.483 --> 28:24.485
SO, WE MISSED YOU
AT DINNER.

28:24.485 --> 28:26.487
YEAH, I'M SORRY.
I CALLED YOUR PARENTS

28:26.487 --> 28:27.880
AND TOLD THEM I WISH
I COULD HAVE BEEN THERE.

28:27.880 --> 28:29.011
HOW--HOW WAS IT?

28:29.011 --> 28:32.014
WELL, YOU KNOW...

28:32.014 --> 28:35.365
WITHOUT YOU, IT WAS...
KIND OF PARENTISH.

28:35.365 --> 28:37.585
MMM.

28:37.585 --> 28:38.629
[SIGH]

28:38.629 --> 28:40.501
SO THIS IS WHAT
YOU MISSED DINNER FOR,

28:40.501 --> 28:42.546
YOU'RE READING
OLD ISSUES OF SASSY?

28:42.546 --> 28:45.854
YEAH, LISA SEEMS TO
THINK IT'LL GIVE ME
A BETTER SENSE OF...

28:45.854 --> 28:49.249
I DON'T KNOW WHAT.
SOMEWHERE TO START,
ANYWAY.

28:49.249 --> 28:51.512
IT'S GETTING
KIND OF LATE,

28:51.512 --> 28:54.558
AND...I HAVE TO GO BACK
TO SCHOOL TOMORROW.

28:54.558 --> 28:56.212
SO...

28:56.212 --> 28:57.953
DO YOU WANT ME
TO SPEND THE NIGHT?

28:57.953 --> 28:59.172
YEAH, I DO.

28:59.172 --> 29:00.390
IF YOU WANT TO.

29:00.390 --> 29:02.784
I MEAN, I PROBABLY
WON'T GET TO BED
TILL LATE.

29:02.784 --> 29:05.047
WELL, I GUESS I SHOULD
PROBABLY GO THEN.

29:05.047 --> 29:08.050
NO. NO, NO,
NO, NO, JUSTIN--

29:08.050 --> 29:09.269
JUSTIN, I'M SORRY
I HAVEN'T BEEN

29:09.269 --> 29:11.619
THAT MUCH FUN
THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS.

29:11.619 --> 29:14.274
ALL RIGHT, BUT THIS
IS A BIG DEAL FOR ME.

29:14.274 --> 29:15.841
I KNOW YOU THINK
IT'S SILLY,

29:15.841 --> 29:18.757
BUT IT'S A CHANCE FOR ME
TO WRITE FOR A LIVING,
YOU KNOW?

29:18.757 --> 29:23.065
I MEAN, TO DO SOMETHING
DIFFERENT EVERY MONTH,
DO SOMETHING NEW.

29:23.065 --> 29:25.851
YEAH, I KNOW,
DIFFERENT AND NEW.
YOU SAID THAT.

29:25.851 --> 29:28.244
WHY IS IT THAT I'M SUDDENLY
KIND OF FEELING...

29:28.244 --> 29:29.985
OLD AND FAMILIAR?

29:32.118 --> 29:34.685
WHEN YOU GET BACK,
WE'LL SPEND TIME
TOGETHER. I PROMISE.

29:34.685 --> 29:37.297
NO, JULIA,
FORGET ABOUT ME.

29:37.297 --> 29:39.778
YOU TURNED DOWN
A SPEAKING ENGAGEMENT

29:39.778 --> 29:42.563
AT THE NAPA WOMEN'S
CONFERENCE FOR WHAT?

29:42.563 --> 29:47.176
SO THAT YOU CAN WRITE
HOW TO TEST DRIVE YOUR
SECRET SEX FANTASIES?

29:47.176 --> 29:50.658
I MEAN, YOU'RE
BLOWING OFF THINGS
THAT ACTUALLY MATTER.

29:50.658 --> 29:53.704
YOU SHOULD THINK
ABOUT THAT.

30:20.644 --> 30:22.385
HI.

30:23.299 --> 30:24.300
WHAT ARE YOU--

30:24.300 --> 30:26.259
WHAT'S GOIN' ON?

30:26.259 --> 30:28.565
I'M ON A FLIGHT
TO LONDON.

30:30.045 --> 30:32.613
I WAS GONNA COME OVER
AND SAY GOOD-BYE.

30:32.613 --> 30:36.051
WAIT...
FOR HOW LONG?

30:36.051 --> 30:39.489
I MEAN, YOU'RE PACKIN'
ALL YOUR STUFF UP.

30:39.489 --> 30:41.100
I'M NOT COMING BACK.

30:41.100 --> 30:43.450
HOLLY...

30:43.450 --> 30:44.886
HEY--

30:44.886 --> 30:47.236
I'M SORRY, I COULDN'T
LET YOU TALK ME OUT
OF THIS, BAILEY.

30:47.236 --> 30:48.281
I CAN NEVER
SAY NO TO YOU.

30:48.281 --> 30:49.717
YOU SHOULDN'T.

30:49.717 --> 30:53.025
LISTEN, EVEN IF
YOU HAVE TO BREAK OFF
THIS MARRIAGE WITH WILL,

30:53.025 --> 30:55.114
IT'S NOT TOO LATE.

30:55.114 --> 30:56.202
HOLLY,
THERE'S STILL ME.

30:56.202 --> 30:59.292
BAILEY...

30:59.292 --> 31:01.860
PLEASE, CAN'T WE JUST--

31:03.209 --> 31:05.559
CAN'T WE JUST HAVE
A SIMPLE GOOD-BYE?

31:12.348 --> 31:13.959
WHY?

31:13.959 --> 31:17.310
WHY ARE YOU GIVING UP
ON THIS SO EASILY?

31:17.310 --> 31:19.051
EASILY?

31:19.051 --> 31:21.357
YOU THINK
THIS IS EASY?

31:21.357 --> 31:23.185
NO, NO, I DON'T.

31:23.185 --> 31:25.187
LOOK, WE BOTH KNOW
THE TIMING

31:25.187 --> 31:27.450
HAS BEEN LOUSY FOR US
FROM THE START.

31:27.450 --> 31:30.192
I ONLY MET YOU
BY MISTAKE.

31:30.192 --> 31:32.238
AND THEN, THINGS
MOVED SO QUICKLY,

31:32.238 --> 31:33.892
AND...

31:33.892 --> 31:37.852
LIFE HAS
BEEN SCREAMING AT US,
"IT'S NOT MEANT TO BE."

31:41.595 --> 31:43.902
I WISH I COULD STAY.

31:45.120 --> 31:47.122
BUT THE FACT OF
THE MATTER IS THAT

31:47.122 --> 31:50.386
THAT WOULDN'T BE GOOD
FOR EITHER OF US.

31:50.386 --> 31:52.040
I'VE BEEN AWAY FROM HOME
FOR TOO LONG,

31:52.040 --> 31:55.130
AND YOU--YOU--

31:55.130 --> 31:58.525
YOU'VE
BEEN TRYING TO FIND
WHERE YOU WANT TO BE.

31:58.525 --> 32:00.875
I'M SLOWING YOU DOWN.

32:03.356 --> 32:07.012
YOU'LL FIND WHAT
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR
FASTER WITHOUT ME.

32:23.158 --> 32:25.378
I'LL MISS YOU.

32:31.210 --> 32:33.995
NO, WE'RE ON SCHEDULE.
MAYBE A DAY OR 2 BEHIND.

32:33.995 --> 32:36.345
THAT'S RIGHT.

32:36.345 --> 32:37.738
WHERE YOU BEEN?

32:37.738 --> 32:38.739
UH, THE OFFICE.

32:38.739 --> 32:40.393
NO, NO, YOU CAN
ADD TO THE ORDER,

32:40.393 --> 32:43.178
BUT YOU HAVE TO EXPECT
SOME EXTRA TIME UNTIL
WE GET THE SETS MATCHED.

32:43.178 --> 32:44.310
CHARLIE--

32:44.310 --> 32:45.702
TOMMY, I GOTTA
TAKE CARE OF THIS,

32:45.702 --> 32:47.574
AND I NEED YOU
TO STAY ON THE LINE
UNTIL MITCH GETS BACK.

32:47.574 --> 32:50.403
CHARLIE, MITCH IS DEAD.

32:51.317 --> 32:52.274
WHAT?

32:52.274 --> 32:55.190
ELAINE--
ELAINE JUST CALLED.

32:55.190 --> 32:56.583
MITCH WENT INTO
CARDIAC ARREST,

32:56.583 --> 32:59.325
AND THEY COULDN'T
BRING HIM BACK
THIS TIME.

33:00.717 --> 33:02.415
BUT I JUST TALKED TO HIM.

33:02.415 --> 33:05.157
I BETTER
GO TELL THE GUYS.

33:20.520 --> 33:21.782
HEY.

33:21.782 --> 33:24.002
I JUST TRIED
CALLING YOU.

33:24.002 --> 33:25.786
YOUR DAD SAID
YOU WERE ON YOUR
WAY TO THE AIRPORT.

33:25.786 --> 33:28.919
YEAH, I AM. MY MOM'S
IN THE CAR RIGHT NOW.

33:31.270 --> 33:34.142
I, UH, I JUST
WANTED TO STOP BY
AND SEE HOW YOU WERE.

33:34.142 --> 33:39.104
I...KIND OF WENT OFF
ON YOU LAST NIGHT, SO...

33:39.104 --> 33:40.975
I STAYED UP TILL
5:00 IN THE MORNING

33:40.975 --> 33:42.803
TRYING TO WRITE
THAT STUPID PIECE,

33:42.803 --> 33:43.934
THINKING ABOUT
WHAT YOU SAID,

33:43.934 --> 33:45.545
AND YOU WERE RIGHT.

33:45.545 --> 33:47.982
I SHOULD HAVE BEEN
WRITING THE SPEECH FOR
THE WOMEN'S CONFERENCE.

33:47.982 --> 33:48.983
SO...

33:48.983 --> 33:50.506
THAT'S WHAT I DID.

33:50.506 --> 33:54.467
I THOUGHT
YOU DIDN'T WANT TO WRITE
ABOUT OLD THINGS ANYMORE?

33:54.467 --> 33:56.556
YEAH, WELL,
I PUT A NEW SPIN ON IT.

33:56.556 --> 33:57.948
IT WORKS SOMETIMES,
YOU KNOW.

33:57.948 --> 33:59.341
YEAH.

33:59.341 --> 34:02.040
HEH. SO, UM...

34:02.040 --> 34:04.607
COME HOME SOON.

34:04.607 --> 34:07.132
I WANT MY OLD
BOYFRIEND BACK.

34:41.992 --> 34:45.170
GOD, THOSE POOR KIDS.

34:45.170 --> 34:48.303
I KNOW.

34:49.174 --> 34:50.175
[SNIFFLES]

34:50.175 --> 34:52.307
YOU OK?

34:53.830 --> 34:55.832
CHARLIE...

34:55.832 --> 34:58.661
I LOVE YOU.

34:58.661 --> 35:01.273
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.

35:04.493 --> 35:06.669
[CRYING]

35:11.544 --> 35:12.632
HEY.

35:12.632 --> 35:14.024
YOUR MOM WAS
ON HER WAY OUT,

35:14.024 --> 35:18.681
BUT SHE SAID
I SHOULD JUST COME UP.

35:18.681 --> 35:20.379
IS THAT OK?

35:20.379 --> 35:22.903
YEAH, OF COURSE.

35:24.383 --> 35:26.863
SO, I WROTE
THE CHECK TODAY...

35:26.863 --> 35:28.474
TO STANFORD.

35:28.474 --> 35:29.562
WHAT?

35:29.562 --> 35:30.911
I TOLD YOU.

35:30.911 --> 35:32.826
I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

35:36.873 --> 35:38.092
BUT I THOUGHT--

35:38.092 --> 35:40.268
I WOULD LIKE
TO GO TO JULLIARD.

35:40.268 --> 35:44.098
I THINK ABOUT
EVERYTHING THAT
I'D HAVE TO GIVE UP.

35:44.098 --> 35:48.494
IT'S TOO MUCH.

36:05.728 --> 36:08.078
CLAUDIA...

36:26.662 --> 36:31.014
SO LISTEN. UH...MAYBE IT'S
TOO SOON TO BRING THIS UP,

36:31.014 --> 36:35.932
BUT I WAS THINKING THAT WE WAIT
A WEEK OR SO AND THEN PROMOTE
TOMMY TO FOREMAN.

36:35.932 --> 36:38.108
YEAH, I THINK
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

36:38.108 --> 36:41.851
IT'S NOT ALL WE HAVE TO
CHANGE AROUND HERE, EITHER.

36:41.851 --> 36:43.201
WE HAVE BEEN PUSHING TOO HARD.

36:43.201 --> 36:49.511
CHARLIE,
YOU CAN'T MAKE DECISIONS
LIKE THAT RIGHT NOW, OK?

36:49.511 --> 36:51.774
NOT WHEN
YOU'RE STILL FEELING
ALL THIS STUFF FOR MITCH.

36:51.774 --> 36:54.081
IT'S ACTUALLY SOMETHING
THAT HE SAID.

36:54.081 --> 36:57.432
HE SAID THAT WE'RE
BUILDING THIS THING

36:57.432 --> 36:59.391
TO PROTECT OUR FAMILIES.

36:59.391 --> 37:04.396
YOU KNOW WHAT?
WE CAN'T GUARANTEE THAT.

37:04.396 --> 37:07.268
WE COULD BUILD IT
AND BUILD IT AND BUILD IT,

37:07.268 --> 37:08.835
AND IT COULD STILL FAIL.

37:08.835 --> 37:10.967
AND THE ONLY THING
THAT WE CAN BE SURE ABOUT

37:10.967 --> 37:12.926
IS THAT OUR FAMILIES
ARE HERE RIGHT NOW.

37:12.926 --> 37:15.233
AND IF DON'T SPEND TIME
WITH THEM WHILE WE CAN...

37:17.931 --> 37:19.672
I WANT TO KEEP
THIS COMPANY SMALL.

37:19.672 --> 37:22.675
A MANAGEABLE FAMILY BUSINESS.

37:22.675 --> 37:25.547
SOMETHING THAT I CAN RUN
WITHOUT TOO MUCH HELP.

37:25.547 --> 37:29.334
MAYBE JUST ONE
BUSINESS PARTNER. PERIOD.

37:29.334 --> 37:31.379
CHARLIE, BEFORE YOU--

37:31.379 --> 37:34.077
AND I'M THINKING THAT MAYBE
I'M GONNA CHANGE THE NAME
OF THE COMPANY.

37:34.077 --> 37:36.645
HOW'S SALINGER BROTHERS SOUND?

37:40.519 --> 37:41.955
CHARLIE...

37:41.955 --> 37:44.871
I KNOW THIS IS NOT EVERYTHING
THAT YOU'VE EVER DREAMED ABOUT,

37:44.871 --> 37:47.874
BUT THIS COULD
BE GREAT FOR YOU.

37:47.874 --> 37:51.051
IT'S A 9-5 JOB
WITH PLENTY OF TIME
TO DO OTHER STUFF, TOO.

37:51.051 --> 37:54.881
BE WITH FAMILY. TAKE CLASSES.
WHATEVER YOU WANT.

37:54.881 --> 37:59.581
AND WE'LL BE WORKING TOGETHER,
AND WE'LL JUST...TAKE IT EASY

37:59.581 --> 38:02.454
AND...KEEP THINGS SMALL.

38:04.847 --> 38:07.502
WOW. UH...

38:07.502 --> 38:10.636
DON'T ANSWER RIGHT NOW.
IT'S A BIG STEP. I KNOW.

38:10.636 --> 38:13.856
I JUST WANT YOU TO GIVE IT
SOME THOUGHT.

38:13.856 --> 38:16.119
I WILL.

38:17.425 --> 38:18.557
I WILL.

38:26.869 --> 38:29.959
I HAD SEX.

38:29.959 --> 38:33.049
I KNOW. I WAS THERE.

38:34.573 --> 38:37.140
ARE YOU OK?

38:37.140 --> 38:39.186
I MEAN, WAS IT...

38:39.186 --> 38:41.623
YEAH.

38:43.103 --> 38:44.626
IT WAS...

38:45.932 --> 38:47.325
IT WAS...

38:47.325 --> 38:48.891
OH, GOD.

38:48.891 --> 38:53.940
NO, IT WAS JUST--IT WAS
DIFFERENT THAN I EXPECTED.

38:55.898 --> 38:58.336
IT WAS LIKE WE ARE,
YOU KNOW.

38:58.336 --> 39:02.383
IT WAS KIND OF INTENSE,

39:02.383 --> 39:04.864
KIND OF FUNNY,

39:04.864 --> 39:08.346
AND A LITTLE BIT
AWKWARD IN PLACES.

39:10.783 --> 39:13.438
IT WAS JUST DIFFERENT,
THAT'S ALL.

39:14.700 --> 39:17.050
LIKE IT IS NOW.

39:19.661 --> 39:21.707
IT'S ALL DIFFERENT.

39:38.027 --> 39:39.377
HEY.

39:42.075 --> 39:45.252
YOUR MOM TOLD ME YOU'RE
HEADING BACK TO SCHOOL.

39:45.252 --> 39:49.865
YEAH. I CALLED, AND THEY SAID
IF I TAKE SUMMER SCHOOL CLASSES,

39:49.865 --> 39:52.477
I CAN MAKE UP MOST OF THE YEAR.

39:52.477 --> 39:56.481
OH.

39:56.481 --> 40:00.398
I GUESS I JUST
DIDN'T EXPECT YOU TO
BE TAKING OFF SO SOON.

40:04.097 --> 40:06.752
SO, ARE THEY MAD?

40:06.752 --> 40:08.057
YOUR PARENTS?

40:08.057 --> 40:09.711
NO, NOT ANYMORE.

40:09.711 --> 40:13.106
NOW THAT I'VE SEEN
THE ERROR OF MY WAYS.

40:13.106 --> 40:16.588
NOW THAT "THE WASTED YEAR"
IS ENDING.

40:18.372 --> 40:20.113
THAT WHAT IT WAS?

40:23.595 --> 40:27.990
LISTEN, THIS HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH YOU.

40:27.990 --> 40:30.950
NOT REALLY.

40:30.950 --> 40:34.127
IT'S MORE LIKE
WHAT'S WRONG WITH MY LIFE

40:34.127 --> 40:36.956
IF THE MOST USEFUL THING
I CAN THINK TO DO

40:36.956 --> 40:40.176
IS TO MARRY SOMEONE TO HELP THEM
GET THEIR GREEN CARD?

40:43.005 --> 40:47.532
WILL...I'M SORRY.

40:47.532 --> 40:49.534
DON'T BE.

40:50.839 --> 40:53.581
I'D DO IT ALL AGAIN.

40:53.581 --> 40:54.843
BECAUSE THE REASON
I DID IT...

40:54.843 --> 40:56.192
I KNOW.

40:56.192 --> 41:00.066
YOU'RE THE MOST
UNBELIEVABLE FRIEND.

41:03.286 --> 41:05.027
AND NOW YOU'RE LEAVING.

41:07.595 --> 41:10.555
EVERYBODY'S LEAVING
ALL OF A SUDDEN.

41:10.555 --> 41:14.689
I DON'T KNOW, IT'S JUST...

41:14.689 --> 41:16.822
IT'S TIME.

41:16.822 --> 41:18.563
I UNDERSTAND.

41:20.826 --> 41:22.741
I ACTUALLY DO.

41:23.916 --> 41:25.570
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

41:26.832 --> 41:30.139
YOU THINKING
OF MAKING A MOVE, TOO?

41:32.838 --> 41:34.535
I DON'T KNOW.

41:34.535 --> 41:41.803
WELL...IF YOU EVER
MAKE A MOVE BACK EAST,

41:41.803 --> 41:43.675
I HOPE IT'S NEAR ME.

41:46.068 --> 41:48.462
YEAH.

41:48.462 --> 41:50.290
ME, TOO.

41:57.036 --> 42:01.388
...CURRENT DESIRE
TO REINVENT OURSELVES,

42:01.388 --> 42:03.303
TO BE FASHIONABLE,
TO BE CURRENT,

42:03.303 --> 42:04.870
IF NOT AHEAD OF THE CURVE.

42:04.870 --> 42:08.221
WE READILY ACCEPT--
THERE'S NO ESCAPING IT.

42:08.221 --> 42:12.094
THE PREDOMINANTLY MALE CULTURE'S
EXPECTATIONS OF ITS WOMEN ARE--
