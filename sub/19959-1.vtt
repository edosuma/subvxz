01:11.346 --> 01:12.345
Christine!

01:12.545 --> 01:15.144
Don't shout, I tell you!
Don't shout!

01:15.344 --> 01:18.342
I will shout if I want to! Who's
going to prevent me from shouting

01:20.341 --> 01:22.740
Listen to me! Why won't you
listen?

01:22.940 --> 01:25.139
You're a liar! A liar! You lied
when you met me!

01:25.339 --> 01:26.938
You lied to get rid of me!
You're a liar and a cheat!

01:27.138 --> 01:28.537
That's enough of it! Get out
of here!

01:28.737 --> 01:29.937
That's a nice thing for a wife
to say!

01:30.136 --> 01:31.136
I'm nothing of the sort!

01:31.336 --> 01:32.735
Oh, yes, you are! And you're not
going to get rid of me with...

01:32.935 --> 01:34.135
...your silly Reno divorce!
You're my wife!

01:34.334 --> 01:35.334
Well, what about it?

01:35.534 --> 01:37.933
And I'm not going to have any
boys hanging around

01:38.133 --> 01:39.132
What do you mean?

01:39.332 --> 01:41.331
Oh, you can't fool me! I've
watched him! I saw him come in!

01:41.531 --> 01:43.130
Don't be a fool! That boy
is not...

01:43.330 --> 01:46.129
-A liar! A liar!
-Why won't you listen?

01:46.329 --> 01:47.528
Because I'm not an idiot!

01:47.728 --> 01:49.327
You quit me eight years ago to go
on the screen!

01:49.527 --> 01:51.326
I, who worked for you! Took you
out the chorus...

01:51.526 --> 01:52.926
...let you out of the gutter

01:53.125 --> 01:55.524
And now you spend your time
going around with boys, you!

01:55.724 --> 01:58.723
Go on, say it, say it!

03:12.687 --> 03:14.686
Christine!

03:59.065 --> 04:02.064
-Is she drowned?
- No, she's a mermaid

04:03.263 --> 04:07.461
This woman was never drowned
She was strangled with this belt

04:08.860 --> 04:10.060
Keep back, please!

04:13.658 --> 04:16.457
Now then, which of you found the
body first?

04:16.656 --> 04:19.255
-I did
-No, he didn't! We did

04:19.454 --> 04:21.254
-Both of you?
-Elsa saw it first.

04:21.454 --> 04:23.054
-That's right!
-But he says he did

04:23.253 --> 04:25.252
-Well, he didn't!
-Contradict the evidence, eh?

04:25.452 --> 04:26.452
Don't be silly

04:26.652 --> 04:28.851
Well, just a moment if you
don't mind

04:29.051 --> 04:30.050
Now, miss, what's your tale?

04:30.250 --> 04:32.449
Well, we were both going down
to bathe

04:32.649 --> 04:34.848
And just as we got

04:35.048 --> 04:36.447
We saw this young man running
away

04:36.847 --> 04:38.246
It's absurd, I was running to
get home

04:38.446 --> 04:39.845
You weren't, you were running
away, wasn't he, Helen?

04:40.045 --> 04:41.844
-That's right
-Nonsense, the girl's hysterical

04:42.044 --> 04:44.643
I'm not! I'm not hysterical!

04:45.243 --> 04:46.842
You were running away, you know
you were!

04:47.042 --> 04:48.641
It's fantastic! I saw the body
from the top of the crest and...

04:48.841 --> 04:50.240
...naturally came down

04:50.440 --> 04:52.239
I couldn't be sure if she was
already dead or only unconscious

04:52.439 --> 04:53.639
You see, I didn't see the belt

04:53.839 --> 04:56.437
I ran out to get help so that I
could make artificial respiration

04:56.637 --> 04:58.237
I was only there a few minutes

04:58.437 --> 05:01.035
This woman has only been dead
a few minutes

05:58.608 --> 06:01.006
Well, it's time we got this thing
finished

06:01.406 --> 06:03.006
Now, is this belt yours or
isn't it?

06:03.205 --> 06:04.405
For the hundredth time I tell
you it isn't!

06:04.605 --> 06:05.804
How do you know it isn't?

06:06.004 --> 06:08.403
You've already admitted that
you've got a raincoat

06:08.603 --> 06:10.402
"Don't put down ""got"", put ""had"" a "
raincoat.

06:10.602 --> 06:13.401
-Which you've lost
-No, not lost, which I had stolen

06:13.600 --> 06:14.800
Why are you trying to distort
everything I say?

06:14.880 --> 06:17.199
Don't get excited, old man, it's
only a formality

06:17.399 --> 06:20.797
You had it stolen, let it go as
that. When was it stolen?

06:20.997 --> 06:22.196
Well, I can't remember

06:22.396 --> 06:24.395
You see, I left it in the car and
went in to get some cigarettes

06:24.595 --> 06:25.994
When I came back it was gone

06:26.194 --> 06:29.393
You mean it just went into
thin air?

06:29.593 --> 06:30.792
What sort of a place was this?

06:30.992 --> 06:32.791
A common shelter called
Tom's Hat

06:32.991 --> 06:34.191
All right, we'll let that go

06:34.390 --> 06:36.190
Now, did you know the dead
woman well?

06:36.390 --> 06:38.189
Yes, fairly well, I knew her in
America

06:38.389 --> 06:40.388
Could it be unfair to suggest
that you were especially...

06:40.587 --> 06:42.587
...good friends?

06:43.586 --> 06:46.984
-Mr. Kent means her lover
- It would be unfair!

06:47.184 --> 06:48.384
Then we could put down that you
were friends, good friends

06:48.584 --> 06:50.183
Oh, put down what you like!

06:50.383 --> 06:52.982
Were you good enough friends to
discuss money?

06:53.181 --> 06:54.981
What's the idea? We discussed
money three years ago when...

06:55.180 --> 06:57.779
... I sold her a story.
Paid in good hard cash

06:57.979 --> 07:08.774
I received money from her on
former occasions

07:08.974 --> 07:12.372
Talking of money, would it be
accurate to say that you are...

07:12.572 --> 07:13.772
...not well off?

07:13.971 --> 07:15.771
More than that, it would be
practically true

07:15.971 --> 07:18.969
Would it? Considering the fact
that she's left you...

07:19.169 --> 07:21.568
...twelve hundred pounds in
her will?

07:30.763 --> 07:34.162
-What's happened to him?
-He passed out or pretended to

07:34.362 --> 07:36.361
Of course he's passed out.
I've been told that

07:36.561 --> 07:39.159
-What's that for?
-To put under his head, of course

07:39.359 --> 07:41.158
That's no good. Sit him up and
hold his head down

07:41.358 --> 07:43.357
Give me a hand!

07:45.356 --> 07:47.755
Go and get some brandy

07:48.555 --> 07:50.354
You seem to be pretty good at
this sort of thing

07:50.554 --> 07:53.552
Yes, I learnt something about it
in a girl guide

07:55.751 --> 07:58.350
You learnt that slapping trick
in the guides too?

07:58.550 --> 08:01.749
No, I learnt that from riding in
cars with detectives

08:04.147 --> 08:05.947
Could you do that to detective's
ears as well?

08:06.146 --> 08:08.145
No, I got this from a boxer's
dressing room

08:08.345 --> 08:09.345
Brings them round like fun

08:09.545 --> 08:11.144
A bit painful, isn't?

08:11.344 --> 08:12.743
Well, you don't know, Sir, when
you have the rest of your face...

08:12.943 --> 08:13.943
...bashed in

08:14.143 --> 08:15.542
I'd say we weren't as brutal as
all that, you know

08:15.742 --> 08:16.941
Give me the brandy, I'll do it

08:17.141 --> 08:19.340
You'll be all right in a minute.
What have you been doing to him?

08:19.540 --> 08:22.139
Oh, he's all right. Don't waste
your time on him, Miss Burgoyne

08:22.539 --> 08:24.138
-Is he guilty?
-No idea yet

08:24.338 --> 08:25.937
He doesn't look like a criminal

08:26.137 --> 08:28.136
Don't let the looks influence
you, young lady

08:28.736 --> 08:30.135
I don't

08:30.535 --> 08:34.933
-Anyway, he's not my type at all
-What the hell has happened?

08:35.133 --> 08:36.332
You passed out

08:36.532 --> 08:38.931
Don't be ridiculous, I never
pass out. What do you mean?

08:39.131 --> 08:40.330
Well, that was something very
much like it

08:40.530 --> 08:41.729
Don't worry, you'll be all right

08:54.123 --> 08:58.921
I must go and find my father.
He seems to like the brandy

09:00.121 --> 09:01.320
He will probably go again

09:01.520 --> 09:03.919
Next time throw a bucket of water
on him

09:04.119 --> 09:06.717
-Who's that?
-She's Chief Constable's daughter

09:06.917 --> 09:09.316
-She's got a nerve!
-She certainly has!

09:18.912 --> 09:20.111
Hello, father!

09:20.311 --> 09:21.310
The proceeding has been
quite formal

09:21.510 --> 09:23.909
Well, in that case, why have they
questioned him half the night?

09:24.109 --> 09:25.908
Scotland Yard may have their own
methods, Sir

09:26.108 --> 09:27.707
Is there someone decent to
represent him?

09:27.907 --> 09:29.506
I think they've got
Mr. Briggs, Sir

09:29.706 --> 09:32.105
-Don't talk nonsense, lnspector
-Well, there was no one else, Sir

09:32.305 --> 09:34.304
-All right. Where have you been?
-I've been snooping around

09:34.504 --> 09:36.503
I left my papers in the car
Go on, go and get them for me

09:36.703 --> 09:39.102
-Get them yourself!
-Well, ordinarily I would

09:39.302 --> 09:41.101
If I was seen beside that thing
I'd have to resign

09:41.301 --> 09:43.100
You never said you were a
disgusting snob, father

09:43.300 --> 09:44.699
Besides, it's almost human, you
ought to love it

09:44.899 --> 09:46.298
And you're asked very politely
to move

09:46.498 --> 09:48.497
It's blocking the entrance of the
court

10:04.490 --> 10:05.489
Come on!

10:05.689 --> 10:07.088
Sorry I can't help you.
Some other time, perhaps

10:07.288 --> 10:10.287
-Come on
-Try and give it some brandy

10:29.478 --> 10:31.077
-Good morning
-Good morning

10:31.277 --> 10:34.475
I'm Briggs. Lovely morning

10:34.675 --> 10:37.274
We mustn't be downhearted on a
morning like this, must we?

10:37.474 --> 10:39.873
It does one good to see the sun,
doesn't it?

10:40.073 --> 10:42.072
My wife was saying only this
morning

10:42.271 --> 10:45.270
Henry, don't be so gloomy about
the case, she said

10:45.470 --> 10:47.269
-Nice of her!
-Wasn't it?

10:47.469 --> 10:50.867
We hadn't had a case like this
for... twelve years

10:51.067 --> 10:54.066
Hardly to be expected in a little
place of this sort

10:54.266 --> 10:56.864
Mostly affiliation orders and
things like that

10:57.064 --> 10:59.863
No, a case like this is most
exciting for us all

11:00.063 --> 11:01.462
Wouldn't it be a good thing to
talk it over?

11:02.262 --> 11:04.861
Well, it can't do any actual harm

11:05.061 --> 11:07.259
There will be plenty of time
before the trial

11:08.259 --> 11:10.858
-The trial?
-Oh, I'm afraid so

11:11.058 --> 11:12.457
Oh, dear, dear, dear

11:14.456 --> 11:20.253
Well now, where was l?
Oh, yes! Yes. Well now...

11:20.453 --> 11:22.052
Well, it doesn't look too good,
does it?

11:22.452 --> 11:24.251
However, we mustn't be
depressed about it

11:24.451 --> 11:26.450
Now, take this point

11:27.250 --> 11:30.248
Those two girls that saw you
running away

11:30.448 --> 11:32.048
-Why were you running away?
-I wasn't

11:32.248 --> 11:35.846
No? Well, it certainly looked
very like it

11:36.046 --> 11:38.445
I mean, that's going to be very
hard to explain away

11:38.644 --> 11:41.243
Like the money that poor dead
creature left you

11:41.443 --> 11:44.042
That's going to be hard to
explain away too

11:44.242 --> 11:47.840
Yes, that... that looks very like
a motive to me

11:48.040 --> 11:54.237
However, we mustn't despair. Not
actually despair. Non desperandum

11:54.637 --> 11:57.036
Oh, now I should be very much
happier

11:57.236 --> 12:00.234
Oh, much, much happier... if it
were not for that belt

12:00.434 --> 12:02.033
Oh, dear me, that belt

12:02.233 --> 12:05.032
I wish I could go out and find
that blasted coat!

12:05.232 --> 12:06.831
I swear it was stolen at Tom's
Hat

12:07.031 --> 12:08.430
-You lost your hat too?
-Oh, no

12:08.630 --> 12:10.229
Oh, well, that's something

12:10.429 --> 12:13.428
Oh, yes, that's quite a good
point! Or isn't it?

12:13.628 --> 12:18.225
Tom's Hat is a common shelter on
the main Crompton Road

12:18.425 --> 12:20.224
If only I could get my coat with
the belt, the police would...

12:20.424 --> 12:22.024
...realize what a colossal blunder
they're making!

12:22.224 --> 12:24.822
Well, of course I'll do
everything I can for you

12:25.022 --> 12:29.020
Though I wish you had been more
frank with the police about it

12:29.220 --> 12:31.419
It always pays to be frank with
the police. However...

12:31.619 --> 12:34.218
Are you representing the police,
by any chance?

12:34.418 --> 12:38.416
Oh, dear me, no, my dear fellow,
I'm on your side

12:39.415 --> 12:42.814
Tell me, when they searched you,
did they leave you your money?

12:43.014 --> 12:47.212
Oh, yes, Sir...
Two pounds and three schillings

12:47.411 --> 12:49.610
I wonder if it would be asking
too much if I could have...

12:49.810 --> 12:51.609
...a trifle on account

12:51.809 --> 12:53.009
Certainly, how much?

12:53.209 --> 12:55.208
Well, I thought perhaps a couple
of pounds?

12:55.408 --> 12:57.607
Oh, thank you!

12:58.006 --> 13:00.205
Yes, it would be a great pity if
you hadn't any money

13:00.405 --> 13:02.204
Counselling costs a great deal,
you know?

13:02.404 --> 13:04.403
However, perhaps you've got some
friends who will come to your...

13:04.603 --> 13:06.202
...rescue at the last minute

13:06.402 --> 13:09.001
-Your case next, Mr. Briggs
-Oh, dear...

13:11.000 --> 13:14.798
Oh, dear me, I just mislaid my
glasses

13:14.998 --> 13:17.197
You know, I'm quite lost without
them

13:17.397 --> 13:20.196
Ask them to delay the procedure
for me a little while, will you?

13:20.396 --> 13:22.395
I shan't be able to read my notes

13:22.595 --> 13:26.393
We mustn't be depressed on a
day like this, must we?

13:37.387 --> 13:39.187
Hold on a minute, the other case
has just finished

13:39.386 --> 13:41.386
Yes, yes, well, we needn't go
into that

13:42.985 --> 13:45.983
Mrs. Bessons, do you really want
a separation order?

13:46.183 --> 13:49.182
Oh, no, Sir, but I don't him
to carry on

13:49.382 --> 13:53.180
Mr. Bessons, will you promise me
to behave yourself in future?

13:53.380 --> 13:56.378
Aye, I will, Sir.
Maybe I were a bit hasty

14:00.376 --> 14:04.175
Well, I shall bind you over to
keep the peace for six months

14:04.374 --> 14:07.173
Sir, can't you make it eight
months to carry me over Christmas?

14:07.373 --> 14:11.971
-No, that'll do.
-Next case, please

14:14.370 --> 14:16.369
-Come straight home
-I'm off to see an old pal

14:16.569 --> 14:18.168
Yes, your old pals at King's
Crown

14:18.368 --> 14:19.367
Hold it!

14:21.966 --> 14:24.165
Look here, this is the wrong man!

14:56.949 --> 15:00.148
The prisoner has escaped!
-The prisoner has escaped?

15:14.341 --> 15:16.340
Your Worship, l...

15:29.334 --> 15:31.133
Come on, you lot!
Run down the street

15:31.333 --> 15:33.932
Three of you surround him. Have
another one search the spinning

15:34.131 --> 15:35.131
Look for a murder in a spinning?
Not me!

15:35.331 --> 15:37.530
-You're not afraid, are you?
-No, but I'm not a fool!

15:37.730 --> 15:40.528
Well, take two others with you!
Here, you two!

15:40.728 --> 15:41.928
And you, with the spectacles!

15:42.128 --> 15:45.126
Go down the Mill Lane, that will
take you to the High Road

15:45.326 --> 15:47.325
One each side of the fence and
one up the road!

16:02.318 --> 16:03.917
Sergeant, take this car and go to
the station

16:04.117 --> 16:05.316
There's a train leaving in a
quarter of an hour

16:05.516 --> 16:06.716
-Make sure he's not on it
-Yes, Sir

16:06.916 --> 16:08.115
And see that every station on the
line is warned

16:08.315 --> 16:09.315
-Right, Sir
-Can you drive it?

16:09.514 --> 16:10.714
-I can drive everything, Sir
-Oh, but...

16:10.914 --> 16:12.113
All right, Erica, the Sergeant
will do it

16:12.313 --> 16:13.912
Yes, but the thing to do is
to pull this...

16:14.112 --> 16:15.312
All right, Miss, you leave
it to us!

16:15.512 --> 16:16.911
Yes, but don't you see you've got
to pull the choke!

16:17.111 --> 16:18.910
Sometimes these get a bit cold.
What's this string doing here?

16:19.110 --> 16:22.708
Hey, that's the choke! It's no
good, you can't sort it out!

16:24.107 --> 16:27.906
Crank up again!

16:47.896 --> 16:51.694
-It's all right, I stopped
-I thouhgt you must have, Miss

16:51.894 --> 16:52.494
It wasn't very uphill

16:52.694 --> 16:54.693
You know, we'll never catch him
this way. You two go on your own

16:54.893 --> 16:56.092
-What about you, Miss?

16:56.292 --> 16:57.891
Oh, I'll be all right. I'll find
some help from somebody

17:02.889 --> 17:05.887
-Halt, young man!
-For what?

17:06.087 --> 17:08.086
-We've got to commandeer you
-You're going to what?

17:08.286 --> 17:10.085
Use your car, in the name
of the law

17:10.285 --> 17:12.483
You can't do that, it isn't a
Black Maria

17:12.684 --> 17:13.684
It is for the moment

17:13.884 --> 17:15.083
We've got to get to the railway
station quickly!

17:15.282 --> 17:18.082
I can't go quickly, the pigs
don't like it

17:18.281 --> 17:19.681
We can't hold back, we're on
a job!

17:19.881 --> 17:21.079
Pigs is my job

17:21.280 --> 17:22.679
I hope you will be all right,
Miss

17:22.878 --> 17:24.478
Don't worry, I hope you'll
find him

17:25.078 --> 17:26.877
-Now then, where do we sit?
-With the pigs

17:27.077 --> 17:28.876
Go on, jump up

17:37.872 --> 17:39.071
Can't you give us a bit more
room?

17:39.271 --> 17:41.470
Carts don't take more than ten
pigs

17:42.270 --> 17:43.869
Come on!

18:09.057 --> 18:10.256
Well, if it isn't Florence
Nightingale!

18:10.456 --> 18:12.056
What are you doing here?

18:12.256 --> 18:13.855
You must be mad, don't you
remember who I am?

18:14.055 --> 18:16.054
Yes, you're only the Chief
Constable's daughter

18:16.254 --> 18:17.453
And my ministering angel

18:17.653 --> 18:19.852
I don't think that's very funny

18:20.052 --> 18:22.651
Don't you realize half the
countryside is looking for you?

18:22.850 --> 18:24.250
And so am l, for that matter

18:24.450 --> 18:26.449
Yes, and now that you've found
me I insist on helping you

18:26.649 --> 18:28.048
I'm determined to push this old
crock as far as the...

18:28.248 --> 18:29.247
...petrol station

18:29.447 --> 18:31.646
What do you mean old crock?

18:31.846 --> 18:34.045
Oh, you're crazy, you haven't
got a hope of escaping

18:34.245 --> 18:35.844
I shall have tell the police
at once!

18:36.044 --> 18:37.643
-There's one thing you should do
-What?

18:37.843 --> 18:38.843
Thank me for pushing the car

18:40.242 --> 18:41.841
Thank you

18:42.041 --> 18:44.240
So you should, especially since
I'm doing all the work

18:53.236 --> 18:55.435
-Two...
-Two gallons, please!

18:55.635 --> 18:58.233
Ginger! Two gallons!

19:04.231 --> 19:08.628
Heard about the escaped man?
He's wanted by the police

19:08.828 --> 19:09.828
-Really?

19:10.028 --> 19:12.027
Just had a police car.
It stopped here for a fill up

19:12.227 --> 19:14.825
If you see that pal you might
tell him to keep on escaping

19:15.025 --> 19:16.625
-It's good for business
-I certainly will

19:17.824 --> 19:21.222
Oi, dad! Dad, oi!

19:24.621 --> 19:26.220
Thanks

19:30.818 --> 19:32.417
-How much?
-Two and eleven

19:32.617 --> 19:33.816
-You keep the penny

19:34.616 --> 19:38.414
Thank you. You must let me know
where to send the money to

19:38.614 --> 19:41.013
Anywhere you like

19:43.812 --> 19:45.411
Will you give it a swing, please?

19:45.611 --> 19:47.210
All right, I'll do it

19:49.609 --> 19:51.008
How far is it to Tom's Hat?

19:51.208 --> 19:53.807
You go straight along that road
about twice as far as you can see

19:54.007 --> 19:56.605
How far would that be?
-Oh, about five miles, I reckon

19:56.805 --> 19:59.204
Then turn right. Go along a mile.
Take the left fork...

19:59.404 --> 20:01.803
...and two miles along that road.
Not the right fork

20:02.003 --> 20:04.602
The right fork would take you
back to town

20:05.801 --> 20:06.801
The left fork...

20:07.000 --> 20:08.800
That's right. There's two miles
up that road

20:09.799 --> 20:10.799
Did you hear that my dear?

20:10.999 --> 20:12.598
Five miles straight ahead, turn
right, along a mile...

20:12.798 --> 20:14.797
...then take the left fork
-Yes, I heard

20:15.596 --> 20:18.595
-You know I can't possibly!
-Don't forget it's my petrol

20:18.795 --> 20:21.593
Straight down that road, it's
about five miles

20:21.793 --> 20:22.993
Yes, thank you, I heard

20:37.586 --> 20:39.785
-This isn't Tom's Hat
-Will you please get out?

20:39.985 --> 20:41.184
-Why?
-Because it's my car

20:41.384 --> 20:42.783
It may seem a good reason to
you but it doesn't to me

20:42.983 --> 20:45.182
It's the best thing you can do!

21:01.574 --> 21:03.973
-So I've won you over
-You certainly have not!

21:04.173 --> 21:05.972
Oh, yes, I have. You see that
it's too risky for me to go to...

21:06.172 --> 21:07.771
...Tom's Hat by daylight, so what
do you do?

21:07.971 --> 21:08.971
Not a thing

21:09.171 --> 21:10.570
You persuade me to stay in this
deserted mill until dark

21:10.770 --> 21:13.369
Then you return and ride me over
to Tom's Hat before it closes

21:13.968 --> 21:15.767
I feel like Bonnie Prince Charlie

21:15.967 --> 21:17.167
You must be Flora MacDonald

21:17.367 --> 21:19.366
A little while ago I was
Florence Nightingale

21:19.566 --> 21:21.365
That's what I like about you,
you're different

21:21.565 --> 21:22.964
How can you joke about this?

21:23.164 --> 21:24.763
Don't you know what it means if
you're caught?

21:24.963 --> 21:26.962
I'd make a rough guess .
Horribly rough

21:27.162 --> 21:28.761
Well, it isn't funny, you see?

21:28.961 --> 21:30.760
No, but I can laugh because
I'm innocent

21:30.960 --> 21:33.159
You don't believe that, do you?

21:33.359 --> 21:35.158
I wish you did

21:37.957 --> 21:39.756
Well, what are you going to do?

22:39.727 --> 22:41.526
For what we're about to receive

22:41.726 --> 22:42.926
Let the Lord make us truly
thankful

22:43.126 --> 22:44.125
O.K.

22:44.325 --> 22:46.324
Chris, you behave yourself.
Think of what this means

22:46.524 --> 22:48.123
O.K.

22:48.323 --> 22:50.322
It ought to be said in
Latin, really

22:50.522 --> 22:53.321
You needn't swag just because you
were talking Latin last term

22:53.521 --> 22:54.720
Did you go to the dentist's this
morning?

22:54.920 --> 22:55.919
-Yes, dad
-It hurt?

22:56.119 --> 22:57.719
No fear, look!

22:58.118 --> 22:59.518
Oh, it is a big hole, isn't it?

22:59.718 --> 23:01.717
That didn't hurt.
I hardly felt anything

23:01.916 --> 23:03.916
The only thing is I must take my
potatoes mashed

23:04.315 --> 23:06.714
You know, I don't mind going to
the dentist's

23:06.914 --> 23:08.513
You were jolly white at breakfast

23:08.713 --> 23:09.913
-I wasn't!
-Yes, you were

23:10.113 --> 23:11.312
You were walking like a jellyfish

23:11.512 --> 23:13.911
-Let's have a look!
-Big, isn't it?

23:14.111 --> 23:16.509
Get over with your lunch, it's
not a nice conversation

23:16.709 --> 23:17.309
I may even bleed

23:17.509 --> 23:18.509
Stanley, be quiet!

23:18.708 --> 23:20.508
Chris, you might lend me your gun
after lunch

23:20.707 --> 23:21.907
I want it for myself, old boy

23:22.107 --> 23:23.706
Erica, you shouldn't let either
of them have it, it's...

23:23.906 --> 23:25.105
...highly dangerous

23:25.305 --> 23:27.504
-Top of the class!
-Don't tease him, you two!

23:27.704 --> 23:29.703
-He does speak English
-Highly dangerous

23:29.903 --> 23:31.702
-Oh, shut up!
-Now that is English

23:31.902 --> 23:33.102
Chris can't shoot straight anyway

23:33.301 --> 23:34.901
Can't l? What about this?

23:35.101 --> 23:37.699
-Christopher don't be disgusting!
-It's a jolly fine one!

23:37.899 --> 23:39.299
Take it away, Chris, and go wash
your hands!

23:39.498 --> 23:40.698
-I washed them before lunch
-Do as I tell you!

23:40.898 --> 23:41.897
O.K.

23:42.097 --> 23:43.896
Sergeant tells me you ran out of
petrol, Erica

23:44.296 --> 23:47.295
Yes, l... I had to push it
for miles

23:47.495 --> 23:49.494
-Haven't they caught him yet?
-No, not yet

23:49.694 --> 23:51.493
It's only a matter of time,
of course

23:51.693 --> 23:52.692
Of course, my dear Watson

23:52.892 --> 23:54.891
Is your tooth all right, Stanley?

23:55.091 --> 23:57.090
Shall I have your potatoes mashed
with milk?

23:57.290 --> 23:58.889
It's all right, don't fuss, Erica!

23:59.089 --> 24:01.488
It really depends how much
money he has

24:01.688 --> 24:04.287
That's often a big factor in
cases like this

24:04.486 --> 24:06.685
-A big what?
-Factor!

24:06.885 --> 24:08.485
-Never heard of him
-Richard...

24:08.684 --> 24:09.684
How much did he have on him?

24:09.884 --> 24:11.483
Oh, the police think about three
schillings

24:11.683 --> 24:14.282
The solicitor took two or three
pounds in advance

24:15.281 --> 24:16.481
Did you wash your hands,
Christopher?

24:16.681 --> 24:17.680
Yes, Erica

24:17.880 --> 24:18.880
Then sit down and get on with
your lunch

24:19.079 --> 24:21.278
If he has spent those last three
schillings it looks to me as...

24:21.478 --> 24:23.477
...if he's caught like a rat
in a trap

24:24.477 --> 24:25.876
Do as I tell you, Christopher!

24:26.076 --> 24:29.075
O.K. Guns are the best things for
rats

24:29.275 --> 24:30.274
Don't be such a swank!

24:30.474 --> 24:31.673
The rat was probably dead when
you shot it!

24:31.873 --> 24:33.672
It wasn't! The rat was running
across the backyard

24:33.872 --> 24:36.471
If I had gone with the police
with my gun I could've shot...

24:36.671 --> 24:37.870
...him, couldn't I father?

24:38.070 --> 24:39.470
Christopher, don't talk so much!

24:39.670 --> 24:41.669
-What's the matter with you?
-Nothing

24:41.869 --> 24:43.668
I wonder what he would buy with
these last three schillings

24:43.868 --> 24:44.867
Food, of course!

24:45.067 --> 24:46.466
I know that, I meant what kind
of food

24:46.666 --> 24:47.666
Sausages!

24:47.866 --> 24:48.865
The best thing would be chocolate

24:49.065 --> 24:50.664
It has very good staying power

24:50.864 --> 24:52.663
Suppose he didn't dare to go
into a shop and get food

24:52.863 --> 24:54.662
Then I'm afraid he would be very
hungry

24:54.862 --> 24:56.462
And that, of course, may force
him to come back

24:56.661 --> 24:58.660
Unless he faints with hunger or
dies in the fields

24:58.860 --> 25:00.659
With rooks pecking at his eyes

25:05.057 --> 25:08.056
Inspector Marsh is on the phone
for you

25:12.654 --> 25:14.053
Perhaps there's some news

25:14.853 --> 25:18.451
Yes, lnspector.
No news at all?

25:20.850 --> 25:24.448
Well, there must be some
sort of clue

25:25.248 --> 25:31.045
Yes, I see.
Oh, dear me

25:32.044 --> 25:34.443
All right, I'll come along
quickly

25:35.843 --> 25:38.042
Let me know if anything turns up

25:39.041 --> 25:42.639
Yes. Goodbye

25:43.039 --> 25:45.238
-Have they caught him yet?
-No, not yet

25:45.438 --> 25:46.837
That don't say much of our
police force

25:47.037 --> 25:48.836
They want some young blood,
don't they father?

25:49.036 --> 25:50.835
"What do you mean ""young "
"blood""?"

25:51.035 --> 25:53.634
If they don't find him, you will
get the sack, father?

25:53.834 --> 25:55.033
I shouldn't be too depressed

25:55.233 --> 25:57.032
I don't think he's got much
chance, though

25:57.232 --> 25:58.632
The inspector tells me he only
has a couple of schillings on him

25:58.832 --> 26:00.831
Excuse me, I shall be here in
a minute

26:01.031 --> 26:03.829
All the roads are circled.
Can't last long

26:04.029 --> 26:06.028
It's jolly exciting, isn't it?

28:01.773 --> 28:03.172
Looking for these?

28:05.971 --> 28:09.169
So you came back after all?
You really do think I'm innocent

28:09.369 --> 28:13.967
Not at all, l... I came back to
pay my debt for the petrol

28:14.966 --> 28:16.366
Hello, what's that?

28:18.365 --> 28:19.364
Food?

28:20.364 --> 28:24.562
I... I really don't know

28:27.960 --> 28:28.960
Goodbye

28:30.759 --> 28:31.958
Perhaps you're right

28:32.158 --> 28:34.357
It's dangerous for you to be
around here

28:34.757 --> 28:36.756
Seriously, I'm very grateful

28:36.956 --> 28:40.354
If it's any consolation to you I
want to you know I'm innocent

28:41.354 --> 28:43.353
Just because I know nothing about
this horrible business I made...

28:43.553 --> 28:44.752
...a dash this morning

28:44.952 --> 28:47.151
I know if only I could get to
that common shelter I would...

28:47.351 --> 28:49.949
...put an end to this crazy
situation

28:52.348 --> 28:54.547
You mind if I eat?

28:59.345 --> 29:01.744
Talking about shelters, this is
more than I can bear

29:01.944 --> 29:04.542
Twenty four hours since I had
the police station tea

29:11.739 --> 29:13.338
No table

29:39.726 --> 29:42.324
You wouldn't trust a murderer
like me with a knife, eh?

29:42.524 --> 29:45.723
It isn't that at all, l...
I just forgot it

29:45.923 --> 29:48.521
There you are, you see?
You don't believe I'm a murderer

29:49.721 --> 29:51.120
Now, where was l?
Oh, yes

29:51.320 --> 29:53.319
Christine Clay was strangled with
a belt from a raincoat

29:53.519 --> 29:55.718
I knew her and can't produce my
raincoat, it was stolen

29:55.918 --> 29:58.317
But I'm going to find it with its
belt, you will see

29:58.517 --> 30:02.715
-Then I shall be cleared
-Did you...?

30:03.314 --> 30:05.513
-What were you going to say?
-No, nothing, it doesn't matter

30:05.713 --> 30:07.712
No, go on, what were you going
to say?

30:08.912 --> 30:11.310
Did you know Christine Clay
very well?

30:11.510 --> 30:14.709
No. I met her in Hollywood

30:14.909 --> 30:16.708
She liked a story I wrote and
asked me to write another...

30:16.908 --> 30:17.907
...that's all

30:18.107 --> 30:20.506
I went to her cottage three or
four times to talk things over

30:20.706 --> 30:21.905
Beyond that...

30:22.705 --> 30:24.504
-See that?
-What?

30:24.704 --> 30:26.703
A bit of paper coming out of
the old mill

30:26.903 --> 30:29.502
-Someone's in there
-Perhaps it's...

30:29.702 --> 30:31.301
Yes. Come on

30:31.501 --> 30:38.000
We were on good terms but I'd
never dream she'd go as far as...

30:33.700 --> 30:35.299
...to leave me something in
her will

30:35.899 --> 30:37.298
-Is that your dog?
-Yes, why?

30:37.498 --> 30:40.097
-What's it barking for?
-Well, he wants dinner, I suppose

30:45.694 --> 30:46.893
Grab hold of him

30:47.093 --> 30:48.892
-Me?
-Yes, get on with it

30:49.092 --> 30:50.292
What if he bites me?

30:50.492 --> 30:51.891
In the course of duty you might
get a stripe

30:52.091 --> 30:54.090
What's the good of a stripe if
I've got no arm to wear it on?

30:54.290 --> 30:56.089
Go on, grab hold of that dog!

31:01.886 --> 31:04.085
It's all right, leave him alone
and come inside

31:09.083 --> 31:11.482
-Anyone up there?
-No

31:11.681 --> 31:13.680
Lad, it's no time for fun

31:13.880 --> 31:16.679
You go to the loft and have
a look!

31:33.271 --> 31:35.270
All right, Sergeant, no one
up there

31:35.470 --> 31:37.469
-Are you sure?
-Oh, I couldn't see no one

31:37.669 --> 31:39.468
-Did you look?
-Of course I did!

31:39.868 --> 31:41.667
I'm going to make sure

31:41.867 --> 31:43.466
Haven't you got no confidence in
me, Sergeant?

31:43.666 --> 31:44.666
None at all!

31:46.665 --> 31:48.864
I have a good mind to go up and
have a look myself

31:56.460 --> 31:58.259
-Don't let them see you!
-Where are we going?

31:58.459 --> 32:00.658
Don't ask questions, pull
that string!

32:01.857 --> 32:08.454
Come here! Stop! ln the name of
the law! Stop that car!

32:08.654 --> 32:10.653
Dowser, we left Dowser behind!

32:11.253 --> 32:13.652
-It's all right, he's keeping up
-If you don't stop I'll jump out!

32:22.647 --> 32:24.446
I've got the sun in my eyes

32:24.646 --> 32:26.645
We will wait until dark now.
Next stop, Tom's Hat

32:26.845 --> 32:28.445
What has the man at the petrol
pump said?

32:28.844 --> 32:30.444
A mile across, then take the
left fork

32:30.644 --> 32:32.243
Two miles beyond that, the end to
all our troubles!

32:32.443 --> 32:34.642
Our troubles? Your troubles,
you mean!

32:34.842 --> 32:36.241
Can't you realize what you've
done?

32:36.441 --> 32:38.240
You made me run away from
Sergeant Roberts

32:38.440 --> 32:40.639
He's my friend, he taught me how
to drive!

32:40.839 --> 32:43.237
My father is chief constable,
can't you understand?

32:43.437 --> 32:44.637
I'm on their side!

32:47.236 --> 32:50.834
Sorry. Forgive me, of course you
must drive straight back

33:26.217 --> 33:28.816
So what? I was going to take the
left fork anyway

33:54.603 --> 33:57.202
No, you'd better not go in.
Someone might recognize you

33:57.402 --> 33:59.201
I'll find out all I can about
the coat

33:59.401 --> 34:01.800
I might as well see if it's
true now

34:05.798 --> 34:07.797
You'd better hide behind it

34:21.790 --> 34:24.188
A cup of tea and a piece of cake,
please

34:26.388 --> 34:27.587
Take a seat

34:27.786 --> 34:28.786
Bill...

34:28.987 --> 34:31.186
You'll have to stick a card out
DAINTY TEAS

34:32.585 --> 34:35.384
I think it's very nice to have a
lady's company for a change

34:35.583 --> 34:38.782
Don't you have lots of it? I
thought lorries were very popular

34:38.982 --> 34:40.380
Is yours that lorry out there?

34:40.581 --> 34:42.580
I've always wanted to drive one
of those

34:42.780 --> 34:45.379
I've always wanted to be a tight
rope walker myself

34:45.579 --> 34:49.577
No, you're the wrong built. You'd
better stick to lorry driving

34:54.175 --> 34:56.174
You don't happen to know, do you,
lf a raincoat was found here...

34:56.373 --> 34:57.573
...last week?

34:57.773 --> 35:00.771
If it was it will never reach the
lost property office

35:01.171 --> 35:03.770
Let me see now... a coat

35:03.970 --> 35:06.569
Well, as a matter of fact there
was one old fellow

35:06.769 --> 35:11.166
More or less of a tramp, really.
He mends broken chi...

35:13.565 --> 35:16.964
No, I'm wrong Miss, you'll never
find that coat

35:17.164 --> 35:19.363
No, you're right, Bill, it was
old Will, the china mender

35:19.562 --> 35:22.161
Don't remember? He had a
raincoat that was nearly new

35:22.361 --> 35:24.560
He said a bloke had given it
to him. We teased him about it

35:24.760 --> 35:27.559
Trying to kid us that people give
brand new clothes away!

35:30.957 --> 35:33.956
Leave old Will alone

35:34.155 --> 35:37.354
If he did, no need for you to go
opening your trap and shouting...

35:37.554 --> 35:39.753
...his name all over the place

35:39.953 --> 35:41.752
So will I do if I like!
What, you're a couple of rotten..

36:29.329 --> 36:30.928
I don't want you to get hurt
What was all the fuss about?

36:31.128 --> 36:33.327
Your coat! You're quite right,
it was stolen!

36:33.527 --> 36:36.526
An old tramp's got it but his two
friends wouldn't let him tell me

36:36.725 --> 36:39.524
Oh, put your head under that

36:51.318 --> 36:53.118
It's difficult!

37:00.514 --> 37:02.713
If you want to find old Will, the
china mender, you'll get him...

37:02.913 --> 37:04.512
...late tonight at Nobby's lodging
house

37:04.712 --> 37:05.711
Well, how far is that?

37:05.911 --> 37:08.310
About thirty miles, I've often
given him a lift there

37:08.510 --> 37:11.309
What's the matter with you?
Get out of here!

37:11.709 --> 37:14.307
-Well?
-Well?

37:14.507 --> 37:16.506
All you have to do now is to get
the coat back from the tramp

37:17.706 --> 37:19.105
I'm glad you took the left fork

37:22.304 --> 37:23.503
So am I now

37:24.702 --> 37:27.701
Goodbye. And many, many
thanks

37:29.300 --> 37:34.098
Can l...
Can I just wish you good luck?

37:38.296 --> 37:40.095
-You ought to get back
-How are you going to get there?

37:40.295 --> 37:42.094
-I'll climb on one of the lorries
-They're all going the other way

37:42.294 --> 37:44.493
Or I could get a lift on a police
car, there will be one along soon

38:04.683 --> 38:06.282
I think it's marvellous of you
but you're not being very...

38:06.482 --> 38:07.482
...sensible, you know?

38:07.682 --> 38:08.681
Must we go on and on about this?

38:08.881 --> 38:10.281
Yes, what about your father,
won't he miss you?

38:10.480 --> 38:11.680
I thought all that out

38:11.880 --> 38:14.279
My aunt lives about two miles
from where we want to go

38:14.478 --> 38:16.078
I will call on her and then tell
my father the truth about...

38:16.278 --> 38:17.277
...where I've been

38:17.477 --> 38:20.276
-To save your conscience, eh?
-Yes, if you like

38:20.476 --> 38:23.474
I will only stay two or three
minutes, then we can be off again

38:23.674 --> 38:26.073
-This may be useful
-What's that for?

38:26.273 --> 38:28.272
For getting in touch with old
Will

38:28.472 --> 38:30.271
He might be in bed when I get
to the lodging house

38:30.471 --> 38:31.670
You mean he doesn't do night
work?

38:31.870 --> 38:34.269
-I shouldn't think so
-Well, we can do without it then

38:49.862 --> 38:53.660
-I shan't be two minutes
-I don't feel too safe sitting here

38:57.258 --> 39:00.456
How are you, Miss Erica? It's a
long time since we saw you last

39:00.656 --> 39:03.455
-Madam will be pleased to see you
-It's nice to see you, Lehmann

39:03.655 --> 39:05.054
-Is auntie in?
-Oh, yes, Miss

39:05.254 --> 39:06.454
It's Miss Felicity's birthday,
you know?

39:06.653 --> 39:08.453
She's having a party

39:09.252 --> 39:12.251
Perhaps I'd better not stay, I
had forgotten about the birthday

39:12.451 --> 39:13.450
No, but you must stay Miss Erica

39:13.650 --> 39:15.249
She'd be so disappointed if
you didn't

39:15.449 --> 39:17.248
Just go in, it'll be quite all right

39:38.038 --> 39:44.036
I will tie two handkerchiefs
One red, the other green

39:44.235 --> 39:46.434
Now, I want you to watch very
carefully because I'm going to...

39:46.634 --> 39:49.633
...tie them together very securely
in this manner

39:49.833 --> 39:53.431
One knot, two knots
I fold them quite tight

39:53.631 --> 39:57.229
Now, the next thing I'll do is to
roll them up tightily into a ball

39:57.429 --> 40:01.227
My dear, this is a surprise!
Will you just have lunch?

40:01.427 --> 40:02.826
And then perhaps after that you
might help us to...

40:03.026 --> 40:04.226
...look after the children

40:04.426 --> 40:06.625
It's so sweet of you to remember
Felicity's birthday!

40:10.223 --> 40:13.421
Now, children, you all know the
game. Don't fidget so, Marjorie!

40:13.621 --> 40:15.420
-One of you has to go outside.
-Me!

40:15.620 --> 40:18.419
-Don't interrupt, Harold!
-I want to go outside

40:18.619 --> 40:21.218
-That is for me to decide.
-I think I must go

40:21.617 --> 40:26.815
Oh... I see. Well, run along,
Harold. And come back!

40:27.015 --> 40:30.213
Erica! Erica! You know this
game, don't you?

40:30.413 --> 40:33.412
I don't think I remember, auntie
I really ought to go

40:33.612 --> 40:35.211
But you've only just come!

40:35.411 --> 40:37.610
Of course you remember the game,
you used to play it so often

40:37.810 --> 40:40.408
Now, you go outside and don't
come in until we tell you

41:09.395 --> 41:11.993
Isn't it Erica's car?
-Yes, it is

41:12.193 --> 41:14.992
-Are you a friend of hers?
-Oh, yes, she's inside

41:15.192 --> 41:16.791
Oh, and left you out here?
I'd never heard such a thing!

41:16.991 --> 41:17.990
She said she won't be long

41:18.190 --> 41:19.989
Oh, she will, it's Felicity's
birthday party

41:20.189 --> 41:21.189
Felicity?

41:21.389 --> 41:22.588
My little daughter, she's seven
today

41:22.788 --> 41:24.587
Oh, yes, of course, Felicity's
birthday, I was forgetting

41:24.787 --> 41:27.186
She always brings her a present,
hasn't missed a year

41:27.386 --> 41:29.385
-Really?
-No, not a year

41:30.384 --> 41:31.584
-All right
-Well, come along in

41:31.784 --> 41:33.183
No, I'd better not

41:33.383 --> 41:34.982
I can't leave you out here like a
criminal

41:35.182 --> 41:38.581
-Come along, it'll be great fun
-Sure it will

41:47.576 --> 41:49.975
Erica, my dear!
It isn't a nice thing

41:50.175 --> 41:51.774
You bring a young man and leave
him outside!

41:51.974 --> 41:53.373
I only meant to stay a few
minutes, uncle

41:53.573 --> 41:56.572
Oh, nonsense, you will stay here
and see the party in full swing

41:57.372 --> 41:59.171
We must get away, every minute
is important!

41:59.371 --> 42:01.170
It's this frightful party, I'm
having an awful job!

42:01.370 --> 42:03.569
Yes, I know. You've been so
good, I'm so grateful...

42:03.768 --> 42:04.768
Come in now!

42:07.367 --> 42:09.366
-I'm sorry, I didn't know
-Hello, my dear

42:09.566 --> 42:11.365
You know what Erica did?
She left her friend outside...

42:11.565 --> 42:13.364
...while she was playing with the
children

42:13.564 --> 42:16.162
I'm very sorry, I only meant to
stay a few minutes

42:16.362 --> 42:17.362
I came because I wanted to...

42:17.562 --> 42:20.161
You came to give Felicity a
birthday present, didn't you?

42:22.559 --> 42:25.158
Oh, how sweet of you, Erica!

42:25.358 --> 42:28.557
One of those lovely stone dwarfs
for the garden. Isn't it nice?

42:28.756 --> 42:31.755
Exactly like the ones we've got
It will fit in so nicely

42:31.955 --> 42:33.554
Shall we join the others?

42:35.353 --> 42:37.352
-Hello, daddy!
-Hello, darling!

42:37.552 --> 42:40.351
Oh, Erica, let's play find the
thimble!

42:40.551 --> 42:41.950
Hello, Felicity, are you having
a nice time?

42:42.150 --> 42:44.349
Yes, thank you, Erica! But I want
to play find the thimble!

42:44.549 --> 42:46.348
Well, I expect you can if you ask
mummy

42:46.548 --> 42:49.347
-I mean I want you to play
-I can't just now, dear

42:49.546 --> 42:52.145
-I will presently
-Why can't you play now?

42:52.345 --> 42:54.344
Come on, we'll play it on
our own!

42:56.943 --> 42:58.542
Major Cunningham, Mrs.
Cunningham

43:09.337 --> 43:10.936
Sit by me

43:12.336 --> 43:15.134
.Get the crackers, please!
-Oh, yes, yes, of course

43:15.334 --> 43:16.534
Mr... Mr...

43:21.131 --> 43:22.531
I suppose you're staying with the
Burgoynes, Mr...

43:22.731 --> 43:23.930
Not exactly, quite near...

43:24.130 --> 43:25.729
That's a large family, I've never
known how many they are but...

43:25.929 --> 43:27.328
...l suppose you find it rather
difficult to...

43:27.528 --> 43:28.528
Yes, I'm not too sure myself

43:28.728 --> 43:31.526
Erica, I'm so sorry, I didn't
quite catch your friend's name

43:32.326 --> 43:33.925
-Beechcott Manningtree
-Oh, really?

43:34.125 --> 43:35.324
That's a extraordinary name,
isn't it?

43:35.524 --> 43:36.924
I don't think I've ever come
across it before

43:38.123 --> 43:39.323
Come along, Erica

43:44.520 --> 43:45.520
Let's go now

43:45.720 --> 43:46.919
We can't, they'll start thinking
things

43:47.119 --> 43:48.318
I started thinking things
long ago

43:48.518 --> 43:49.518
Be quiet

43:49.718 --> 43:52.116
Love calls but once though
passion...

43:52.916 --> 43:55.115
-Steady, old girl
-I'll read it out

43:55.315 --> 43:56.514
You must leave things like that
to me, Harold

43:56.714 --> 43:58.513
It was my motto

43:59.913 --> 44:02.112
-Ah, the ice is here
-In the nick of time

44:15.505 --> 44:16.905
Auntie, we really ought to be
going

44:17.104 --> 44:19.103
-Yes, I really think we should
-Yes, yes, of course

44:19.303 --> 44:21.302
Would you mind picking these
ices for me, please?

44:21.502 --> 44:23.701
Oh, certainly, of course.
Are they strawberry?

44:23.901 --> 44:26.100
Yes, the red's strawberry and the
white's vanilla, you see

44:26.300 --> 44:27.899
Fancy!

44:28.499 --> 44:32.097
It's a nice young man, Erica.
Has your father known him long?

44:32.297 --> 44:35.096
-Not very
-What does he do for a living?

44:36.095 --> 44:38.294
-A sort of a clerk, I believe
-Oh, in what?

44:40.893 --> 44:43.092
Advertising. He makes up
advertisements

44:43.292 --> 44:46.890
What a very uncommon name!
What did you say it was?

44:47.490 --> 44:49.689
-Beechtree Manningcott.
-I didn't see you

44:49.889 --> 44:53.087
Would you just take those ices to
those nurses over there for me?

44:54.487 --> 44:57.885
What a very sweet Erica is, don't
you think so Mr... Croft?

44:58.085 --> 44:59.084
Yes, awfully nice

44:59.284 --> 45:00.484
Have you known Colonel Burgoyne
long?

45:00.684 --> 45:02.083
Oh, yes, years and years

45:02.283 --> 45:04.282
Your work must be very
interesting

45:04.482 --> 45:05.481
My work?

45:05.681 --> 45:07.280
Yes, Erica's just been talking to
me about it

45:07.480 --> 45:09.079
-Oh, yes, of course.
-Do you like it?

45:09.279 --> 45:11.079
So many young men of today
dislike their work

45:11.278 --> 45:12.878
Oh, I love it, I find it very
satisfying

45:13.078 --> 45:14.877
But it must be awfully difficult
to strike the right note

45:15.077 --> 45:17.076
Well, at first, perhaps, but of
course you need a good ear

45:17.276 --> 45:18.275
Ear?

45:18.475 --> 45:20.274
I should have thought the eye
would be much more important

45:20.474 --> 45:23.473
Yes, that's important, certainly
but I can read at sight now

45:23.672 --> 45:24.672
I beg your pardon?

45:24.872 --> 45:26.871
I mean, I can see a piece of
music if it's put in front of me

45:27.071 --> 45:28.870
-I see
-And play, of course

45:29.070 --> 45:30.669
Oh, yes, of course

45:34.867 --> 45:36.866
I'll tell her definitely we're
going

45:41.064 --> 45:42.663
Auntie, I've got rid of those
ices

45:42.863 --> 45:43.863
Now we really should be going

45:44.063 --> 45:46.062
Very well, my dear, it was nice
of you to come

45:46.262 --> 45:47.861
It's a pity you have to go so
soon, I've had such an...

45:48.061 --> 45:50.260
...interesting talk with your
friend, Mr. Manningcroft

45:50.460 --> 45:51.659
We want another game, mother

45:51.859 --> 45:53.458
Oh, let's get the ices served
first

45:59.255 --> 46:01.854
Just before children go.
Well, what should it be?

46:02.054 --> 46:03.853
-Harold wants blind man's buff
-I'll be blind man!

46:04.053 --> 46:07.052
-That's for me to decide, Harold.
-Mothers will be first blind man

46:07.252 --> 46:09.251
-Can't l, uncle?
-I don't think so, dear

46:09.451 --> 46:10.850
All right, you can try and
catch me

46:11.050 --> 46:12.449
Oh, very well

46:40.835 --> 46:47.032
It's... Mr. Beechtree!
Oh... Where's Erica?

46:47.232 --> 46:49.032
They went home.
They asked me to say goodbye

46:49.231 --> 46:50.231
You idiot!

46:50.431 --> 46:52.030
Don't you realize there was
something going on between them?

46:52.230 --> 46:53.629
She didn't know his name! He
didn't know it himself, really!

46:53.829 --> 46:54.829
Oh, you're exaggerating, my dear

46:55.029 --> 46:57.627
Nothing of the sort! I wanted to
find out more about them

46:57.827 --> 46:59.826
You had to make me play blind
man's buff!

47:13.020 --> 47:14.619
There you are, what did I
tell you?

47:14.819 --> 47:17.418
They're not going home, they're
taking the other direction!

47:21.416 --> 47:24.215
Kingston 8-40, please.
Hurry!

47:28.013 --> 47:29.612
All right, hello, Margaret

47:29.812 --> 47:31.011
I thought we would never get
away

47:31.211 --> 47:32.211
Don't you think she seemed a bit
suspicious?

47:32.411 --> 47:34.010
I don't think so, just naturally
inquisitive

47:34.210 --> 47:36.009
She seemed satisfied with the
answers I gave

47:36.209 --> 47:38.008
I nearly died when you produced
that china dwarf

47:38.208 --> 47:39.807
I wonder if she'll ever miss
it from the garden

47:40.007 --> 47:41.206
We mustn't laugh

47:41.406 --> 47:43.006
It was very funny when she asked
my name

47:43.206 --> 47:45.804
-I was scared stiff!
-The look on your face!

47:46.004 --> 47:47.204
We mustn't laugh, it's very
serious!

47:47.404 --> 47:48.603
You look so much better when
you're laughing

47:48.803 --> 47:49.602
Do l?

47:49.802 --> 47:51.202
Of course I don't want to make
trouble

47:51.402 --> 47:52.801
But I feel it's duty to tell you

47:53.001 --> 47:55.200
I mean, Erica's so young, she's
at an awkward age

47:55.400 --> 47:58.998
Oh, but l, I can't understand it

47:59.198 --> 48:01.997
Erica always tells me if she's
going a long way

48:02.196 --> 48:04.795
And certainly who she's going
with

48:06.794 --> 48:09.193
Gordon Bleam is the only man I
don't like to see her with

48:09.393 --> 48:12.591
Then it was him! I was sure that
he gave a false name

48:12.791 --> 48:13.991
Yes, but he's in lndia!

48:14.191 --> 48:15.390
Oh, then it wasn't him

48:15.590 --> 48:18.189
Which way did you see the car
going?

48:18.589 --> 48:25.385
Yes... Yes...
All right, I'll phone you later

48:28.184 --> 48:30.183
He never even thanked me

48:30.383 --> 48:32.582
Two more miles and we'll be
there!

48:32.782 --> 48:33.981
Yes, we'll be there but what
then?

48:34.181 --> 48:36.780
What then, my child? What then?
The tramp, the coat, the belt

48:36.980 --> 48:38.779
Are you sure the tramp will
be there?

48:38.979 --> 48:41.977
Of course, he will be standing at
the door in tears, saying...

48:42.177 --> 48:44.976
"-...""here you are, governor"" "
-Will it be as easy as all that?

48:45.176 --> 48:46.175
Why not, everything has gone all
right up to now

48:46.375 --> 48:47.375
I don't see why that should
change

48:47.575 --> 48:49.574
I hope not. It would be such a
waste

48:49.774 --> 48:51.173
When you go back to your father
you can burst open the...

48:51.373 --> 48:53.172
-...door and say...
-With a throb in my voice

48:53.372 --> 48:55.171
Yes, a throb in the voice is
certainly indicated

48:55.371 --> 48:58.769
You will stand in front of him
and say: I've travelled far...

48:58.969 --> 49:00.368
...and risked much and here is the
man in all his innocence

49:00.568 --> 49:01.968
Then he'll tap me on my head
and say...

49:02.168 --> 49:03.167
With a throb in his voice

49:03.367 --> 49:04.966
-Thank you, Erica, thank you
-It'll be touching

49:05.166 --> 49:08.565
Oh, Robert, if only things would
turn out all right

49:08.764 --> 49:10.963
-They started to
-What do you mean?

49:11.163 --> 49:13.762
-You called me Robert
-Oh, did l?

49:13.962 --> 49:15.161
I didn't notice it

49:15.361 --> 49:18.360
She will be going through Lemming
unless she turns back

49:18.760 --> 49:23.557
Well, it's an old Morris.
No, I don't remember the number

49:23.757 --> 49:27.555
She'll have someone with her.
A young man, I believe

49:27.755 --> 49:29.554
Get her to telephone me, will
you?

49:40.149 --> 49:41.949
Excuse me, are you Miss
Burgoyne?

49:42.148 --> 49:43.148
Yes

49:43.348 --> 49:45.147
Your father's Chief Constable,
isn't he?

49:45.347 --> 49:46.346
Yes, why?

49:46.546 --> 49:47.946
He wants you to phone him
right away

49:48.146 --> 49:50.544
He said it's urgent, will you
step inside?

49:51.144 --> 49:53.743
Why, you are the chap who
escaped from the police this morning

49:53.943 --> 49:56.142
I've seen your picture!
You'd better come inside here...

49:56.342 --> 49:57.941
Quick, step on it!

49:58.940 --> 50:01.939
We were overconfident, I didn't
think about the papers

50:02.139 --> 50:03.938
Thought we may do it
We seem to be crawling

50:04.338 --> 50:06.937
I can't run away like this
Especially with an escaped man

50:07.136 --> 50:09.135
It means I'm an accessory.
And accesories get ten years!

50:09.335 --> 50:11.534
Oh, it's terrible, what will
happen to the boys?

50:11.734 --> 50:15.333
Poor father! We must go faster.
You've to get that coat back

50:15.532 --> 50:17.332
I can't go back now!

50:17.531 --> 50:19.131
Poor father, what shall I
tell him? What shall I tell him?

50:19.331 --> 50:22.329
Right. I suppose he must be
the man

50:23.129 --> 50:26.327
I can't understand it

50:28.326 --> 50:31.325
Keep my daughter's name out of
it, lnspector

50:31.925 --> 50:33.324
For the time, anyway

50:33.524 --> 50:35.723
That's all right, Sir.
Don't you worry

50:35.923 --> 50:37.722
The search is well underway

50:37.922 --> 50:39.921
He's probably forced her to go
to Ashcroft Forest

50:40.121 --> 50:42.120
There'll be less chance for him
to be found there

50:42.320 --> 50:44.319
We're combing the forest
now, Sir

51:25.099 --> 51:26.898
It's all right, my dear, we're
perfectly safe here

51:27.098 --> 51:28.297
We'll hide here for a bit

51:28.497 --> 51:30.896
The whole thing will be over in
a couple of hours or so

51:31.096 --> 51:32.895
We'll shake hands and you'll
never see me again

51:34.295 --> 51:34.694
Won't l?

51:34.894 --> 51:37.093
Oh, you needn't see me again

51:39.092 --> 51:41.691
-Put your coat on
-It's all right

51:41.891 --> 51:45.289
Now you do as I tell you.
I know exactly how you feel

51:46.289 --> 51:49.487
You see no end.
You don't believe it's true

51:50.087 --> 51:53.086
The night always exaggerates
things, doesn't it?

51:53.285 --> 51:56.284
Personally, I like the night,
it's much more alive than the day

51:57.284 --> 52:01.881
Look at those people on that
train. Eating... actually eating

52:02.081 --> 52:04.080
I'll tell you what. I'll scout
about for some food, shall l?

52:05.080 --> 52:07.279
No, we'll wait. We'll wait till
the coat is safe in our hands...

52:07.479 --> 52:09.078
...and then we'll eat, and how!

52:09.278 --> 52:12.676
Straight to a seven course dinner
Seven helpings and champagne

52:12.876 --> 52:16.674
Well, I'm going now.
I shan't be long

52:16.874 --> 52:19.673
And off we'll go before their
goggling eyes

52:21.072 --> 52:22.671
And then I'll carry you all the
way home

52:24.271 --> 52:26.270
Well, now off to the lodging
house

52:29.668 --> 52:31.867
I'll pinch the rover man's hat

52:55.056 --> 52:57.055
Well, how do I look?

53:04.052 --> 53:07.850
Erica...Erica, darling, do say
something

53:10.249 --> 53:15.246
I can't. I just can't

53:18.045 --> 53:27.240
I know I'm being silly but...
I'm so terribly... Terribly tired

53:33.837 --> 53:37.236
My dear, of course you are.
What can I do?

53:37.436 --> 53:39.035
Perhaps you'd better get along
home

53:39.235 --> 53:45.432
-No. I will sit out now
-You're marvellous

53:46.631 --> 53:49.830
I'll be all right here

53:50.029 --> 53:51.829
I don't want anything to happen
to you

53:52.028 --> 53:54.827
You'll be perfectly safe, I
promise you

53:55.027 --> 53:58.226
Now you have a little nap and try
to forget all your worries

53:59.025 --> 54:01.024
That's right

54:05.022 --> 54:10.220
Dowser! Dowser!
Look after her, Dowser

54:14.218 --> 54:19.615
I don't want anything to happen
to you either

54:43.804 --> 54:46.202
-Good evening, Nobby

54:48.002 --> 54:51.000
I ain't Nobby. He's been dead
since before the war

54:51.600 --> 54:53.599
-Have you got a bed?
-One left

54:53.799 --> 54:54.998
-O.K.
-Number 6

54:55.198 --> 54:58.597
-Thanks. Is Old Will in yet?
-Will?

54:58.796 --> 55:02.795
No, I've kept his bed
Are you a pal of his?

55:02.994 --> 55:05.393
-Yes
-I didn't know he had one

55:05.593 --> 55:08.192
Oh, yes. Good night

56:55.940 --> 56:57.939
I don't want any of that business
here, you understand?

56:58.139 --> 56:59.738
And I don't want to come here
again

56:59.938 --> 57:01.538
That's all right, then you keep
out

57:01.737 --> 57:02.937
You will eat those words,
you Finney!

57:03.137 --> 57:04.536
Get out!

57:04.736 --> 57:07.135
Old Will hasn't gone yet, has he?

57:07.735 --> 57:09.934
You're his pal, you ought to know

57:10.133 --> 57:11.733
I just woke up

57:22.527 --> 57:23.727
You know which is Old Will, the
china mender?

57:23.927 --> 57:26.526
No, mate, I never heard of him

57:39.719 --> 57:41.918
So that's the game, is it?

57:45.117 --> 57:47.515
So you are a pal of his after all

57:47.715 --> 57:49.914
How long has this racket been
going on? Will!

57:50.914 --> 57:53.912
Who wants me?
Oh, the governor!

57:57.111 --> 58:00.509
-Hello. A cup wants mending?
-Don't you come here racketing!

58:00.709 --> 58:01.709
What's the trouble?

58:01.909 --> 58:03.908
Getting your pal to bash up my
china so you can mend it!

58:04.108 --> 58:05.107
My pal?

58:05.307 --> 58:06.706
I don't want any argument from
you, it's the last time you've...

58:06.906 --> 58:07.906
...come in here!

58:08.106 --> 58:10.504
What does he mean?
And who are you?

58:10.704 --> 58:11.904
Listen, I want to talk to you

58:12.104 --> 58:13.303
I'll be with you in a minute,
it's my work

58:13.503 --> 58:14.902
I've got to talk to you, it's
about something very important

58:15.102 --> 58:16.701
What's your game?
And who says that I'm your pal?

58:16.901 --> 58:17.901
Well, that was a mistake

58:18.101 --> 58:19.100
I was thinking it pretty well was

58:19.300 --> 58:20.700
I've traced you for nearly
fifteen miles

58:20.899 --> 58:22.499
Fifteen miles, what for?

58:22.699 --> 58:24.098
Do you know anything about a
raincoat?

58:25.097 --> 58:28.696
I don't know what are you talking
about. I've got to get along

58:28.896 --> 58:30.095
You do know something about it

58:30.295 --> 58:31.894
But I'm not interested in you,
I only want the coat

58:32.094 --> 58:33.094
Come on, Will, bash his mouth in

58:33.294 --> 58:35.293
He will get something he don't
expect in a minute

58:35.492 --> 58:37.691
You got a coat from Tom's Hat,
didn't you? Well, it's mine

58:37.891 --> 58:39.690
I only want it as evidence, you
can have it back afterwards

58:39.890 --> 58:41.889
It's no good asking me, I'll keep
telling you I don't know...

58:42.089 --> 58:43.289
...nothing about it!

58:43.489 --> 58:44.488
Why are you so obstinate?

58:44.688 --> 58:46.687
I tell you it's a matter of life
and death! It's going to save me!

58:46.887 --> 58:48.486
It's going to save me from a
charge of murder, the police...

58:48.686 --> 58:49.686
...are after me now!

58:49.886 --> 58:52.884
-Come on!
-I can't come now

58:53.884 --> 58:56.882
Erica! I've got to find her!

58:57.082 --> 58:58.481
Come on, I'm not finished with
you yet!

58:58.681 --> 59:01.680
What's the idea? Wait a minute!
Where are you going?

59:01.880 --> 59:03.079
Halt, stop him!

59:04.079 --> 59:05.678
Hurry up, Sergeant, they're just
going out!

59:10.076 --> 59:14.674
-Erica! Erica! Quick!
-What's the idea?

59:21.670 --> 59:22.870
Drive that way!

59:24.469 --> 59:25.668
You've got the coat?

59:25.868 --> 59:27.667
He knows everthing about it but
he's keeping his mouth shut

59:27.707 --> 59:28.467
I'm kidnapped!

59:28.667 --> 59:29.666
They're coming!

59:39.862 --> 59:41.261
Come on, pal, what's the matter
with the dog!

59:41.461 --> 59:42.860
My cheese, he smells!

59:44.859 --> 59:49.057
The coat! Look, the raincoat!
Pull up, we've got it!

01:00:05.049 --> 01:00:07.648
I didn't know what you were up
to, governor

01:00:07.848 --> 01:00:10.847
Coming along and saying you're
my pal

01:00:11.047 --> 01:00:15.245
And dragging me about like this
I feel like a shy bride

01:00:17.044 --> 01:00:19.043
I'm terribly glad

01:00:20.642 --> 01:00:21.841
I wonder how far is the nearest
telephone box

01:00:22.041 --> 01:00:25.040
-I ought to get on to father
-Here you are

01:00:25.839 --> 01:00:28.038
It's mine, all right

01:00:30.037 --> 01:00:33.036
There's no belt
What have you done with the belt?

01:00:33.436 --> 01:00:34.635
What have you done with that
belt?

01:00:34.835 --> 01:00:35.635
Belt?

01:00:35.835 --> 01:00:37.034
Here's a stitch. What happened
to it?

01:00:37.234 --> 01:00:39.233
There was no belt on it when
that bloke gave it to me

01:00:39.433 --> 01:00:43.631
Then it was my belt. Who do you
say gave you the coat?

01:00:43.831 --> 01:00:45.030
I told you, some fellow

01:00:45.230 --> 01:00:46.430
But can't you remember what he
looked like?

01:00:46.630 --> 01:00:49.228
-Yes, he blinked
"-What do you mean ""blinked""?"

01:00:49.428 --> 01:00:51.027
Like this

01:00:51.627 --> 01:00:53.226
Anyhow, his evidence is as good
as the belt, he knows that...

01:00:53.426 --> 01:00:54.426
...l didn't give it to him

01:00:54.626 --> 01:00:57.824
-Oh, no governor, it wasn't you
-It's no good, Robert

01:00:58.024 --> 01:00:59.823
Of course it is, it's perfectly
good proof!

01:01:00.023 --> 01:01:01.822
The police will never believe
his evidence

01:01:02.022 --> 01:01:03.421
What do you mean, I'm
respectable

01:01:03.621 --> 01:01:05.820
And as for a tramp saying he was
given a practically new overcoat

01:01:06.020 --> 01:01:07.420
They'll think it's fantastic

01:01:10.218 --> 01:01:11.618
I've got to talk to you more
this. The police will catch up...

01:01:11.817 --> 01:01:13.617
...with us soon. Where's the best
place to hide?

01:01:13.816 --> 01:01:15.815
Well, there's a Boulevard
three mile off

01:01:16.015 --> 01:01:18.614
And there's a quiet little lane
where nobody goes much

01:01:18.814 --> 01:01:20.613
Before you get to...

01:01:20.813 --> 01:01:23.412
Oh, what about the old mine
workings? It's about a mile or so

01:01:23.612 --> 01:01:24.811
We'll go, Erica

01:01:54.797 --> 01:01:56.796
Let's try the old mine workings!

01:02:12.988 --> 01:02:15.987
-Robert!
-Hang on, I'm coming!

01:02:53.768 --> 01:02:55.967
-Here they are!
-Quick, they are in here!

01:02:59.566 --> 01:03:01.565
-We left the dog behind!
-He's all right, don't mind it!

01:03:01.765 --> 01:03:02.964
-What do you mean?
I'm going back!

01:03:03.164 --> 01:03:05.363
Don't be such an idiot!
Come!

01:03:06.962 --> 01:03:09.361
-Hold on, Miss, hold on
-Have you got him?

01:03:09.561 --> 01:03:11.960
-No
-Which way did he go?

01:03:12.759 --> 01:03:15.558
Now, Miss Burgoyne. We know
that you have been involved in this

01:03:15.758 --> 01:03:17.957
-It's no fault of your own
-Really?

01:03:18.157 --> 01:03:20.756
I mean, we naturally saw that you
were trying to track him

01:03:20.955 --> 01:03:21.955
I see

01:03:22.155 --> 01:03:24.754
When he gave you the slip, where
do you think he was making for?

01:03:24.954 --> 01:03:27.552
-I don't know
-And he said nothing at all?

01:03:27.752 --> 01:03:28.752
Nothing at all

01:03:28.952 --> 01:03:31.350
Miss Burgoyne, I'm doing all I
can to make things easy for you

01:03:31.550 --> 01:03:33.749
Will you please try and make
them easy for me?

01:03:33.949 --> 01:03:36.148
I've got a job on here and I've
got to find a murderer

01:03:36.348 --> 01:03:37.747
-Then why don't you?
-We're doing our best

01:03:37.947 --> 01:03:40.346
You're not! Can't you see what a
mistake you're making?

01:03:40.546 --> 01:03:42.345
You find a clue and follow it
to death

01:03:42.545 --> 01:03:43.744
The evidence against him is
very strong

01:03:43.944 --> 01:03:45.544
It's not! Can't you tell he
didn't do it?

01:03:45.744 --> 01:03:46.743
He had no reason to do it

01:03:46.943 --> 01:03:48.342
That woman was helping him, he
told you that

01:03:48.542 --> 01:03:49.742
Yes, he told us a lot of things

01:03:49.942 --> 01:03:51.741
And if you stopped chasing him he
might find the real murderer

01:03:51.941 --> 01:03:54.339
I should like to know why you
take all this interest in this

01:03:54.739 --> 01:03:57.938
Because... Because he's innocent

01:03:58.737 --> 01:04:01.736
He couldn't kill anything!
He's much too kind and gentle

01:04:01.936 --> 01:04:03.335
Why, he's the finest person...

01:04:03.535 --> 01:04:05.934
I'm sorry to have kept you
waiting, gentleman

01:04:11.731 --> 01:04:13.930
... For what we're about to
receive

01:04:14.130 --> 01:04:16.329
May the Lord make us truly
thankful

01:04:26.724 --> 01:04:29.523
Christopher, try not to make
noises when eating your soup

01:04:29.722 --> 01:04:31.322
O.K.

01:04:50.313 --> 01:04:53.911
Your father would like to see you
when you finish, Miss Erica

01:05:03.706 --> 01:05:05.705
Come in

01:05:14.901 --> 01:05:16.300
Come in Erica, my dear

01:05:17.899 --> 01:05:20.098
I wanted us to have a little talk
together

01:05:23.697 --> 01:05:26.095
I can quite understand that you
didn't want to speak in front...

01:05:26.295 --> 01:05:28.894
...of those detectives

01:05:30.093 --> 01:05:32.892
But surely there's something you
want to tell me

01:05:33.092 --> 01:05:35.291
That might help us to find this
fellow

01:05:36.690 --> 01:05:41.488
-No, father, there's nothing
-I see...

01:05:41.888 --> 01:05:44.886
You still insist on shielding a
man wanted for murder

01:05:45.286 --> 01:05:46.486
He's not a murderer

01:05:51.483 --> 01:05:54.682
You know as well as I do that you
are committing a criminal offence

01:05:54.882 --> 01:05:57.280
And I'm responsible

01:06:03.477 --> 01:06:05.476
You'd better read this

01:06:17.871 --> 01:06:19.270
Must you do this, father?

01:06:22.468 --> 01:06:25.867
You'd better go to your room and
stay there for the time being

01:07:38.832 --> 01:07:41.231
Is everything all right?
Has Old Will found him?

01:07:43.429 --> 01:07:44.829
I'm going to give myself out

01:07:47.028 --> 01:07:48.627
That's why I came back

01:07:48.827 --> 01:07:51.426
I want you to tell them that I
forced you to do that

01:07:51.626 --> 01:07:55.624
-And to say goodbye
-I did it because I wanted to!

01:07:55.824 --> 01:07:56.823
It's no use

01:07:57.023 --> 01:07:59.222
That coat with no belt was the
end of everything

01:07:59.422 --> 01:08:01.221
I suppose they found it in
the car

01:08:01.421 --> 01:08:03.220
Yes, they brought it in while I
was being questioned

01:08:03.420 --> 01:08:05.219
No belt in the pocket by any
chance?

01:08:05.419 --> 01:08:09.417
No, nothing but a box of matches
of the Grand Hotel

01:08:29.807 --> 01:08:32.805
I've got to go. Old Will's waiting

01:08:35.604 --> 01:08:40.602
Will you go now?
I don't want it

01:09:13.386 --> 01:09:14.786
Erica!

01:09:19.783 --> 01:09:23.381
Those matches!
Did you say Grand Hotel?

01:09:23.581 --> 01:09:24.781
Yes, why?

01:09:24.981 --> 01:09:27.779
I've never been there in my life!

01:09:28.779 --> 01:09:29.978
Then whoever killed her...

01:09:30.178 --> 01:09:33.776
Has been or still is at the
Grand Hotel

01:09:58.764 --> 01:10:01.763
Well, if it isn't Cinderella!
What's the idea?

01:10:01.963 --> 01:10:04.362
-What idea?
-This dressing up for the ball

01:10:04.562 --> 01:10:05.761
I don't know what you mean,
officer

01:10:05.961 --> 01:10:08.160
Well, look: This

01:10:09.759 --> 01:10:12.758
I've been watching you for the
last half hour

01:10:25.552 --> 01:10:26.751
I'm so glad you came back

01:10:26.951 --> 01:10:28.550
I don't know what I'd had done
without you

01:10:28.750 --> 01:10:30.349
After all, you're the only one
who can recognize him

01:10:30.549 --> 01:10:31.549
These boots pinch a bit

01:10:31.749 --> 01:10:34.547
I haven't had the time to slit
them for my corns

01:10:39.345 --> 01:10:40.744
Hadn't we better start looking
for him?

01:10:40.944 --> 01:10:42.543
Yes

01:10:51.339 --> 01:10:53.538
-Here, what's that place?
-That's the office

01:10:53.738 --> 01:10:55.537
Well, perhaps they know that
bloke that twitches

01:10:55.737 --> 01:10:57.536
Let's go and ask

01:10:59.735 --> 01:11:02.734
Excuse me, Miss, you don't
happen to know...?

01:11:02.934 --> 01:11:05.732
-Just a moment, please
-All right

01:11:08.131 --> 01:11:10.530
No good asking her, she'll never
know a thing like that

01:11:12.529 --> 01:11:14.728
-What if I try in there?
-Yes, anywhere

01:11:34.519 --> 01:11:36.518
Yes, Sir?

01:11:38.517 --> 01:11:40.116
-Table for two, please
-Thank you

01:11:47.712 --> 01:11:50.311
We ought to order tea or
something, we can't stay here

01:11:50.511 --> 01:11:52.110
I'd rather have a beer

01:11:52.310 --> 01:11:53.509
I don't think you can get that
kind of thing here

01:11:53.709 --> 01:11:56.308
I'd better order because I'm
the man

01:11:56.708 --> 01:11:59.706
-Two cups of tea, please
-Indian or Chinese, Sir?

01:12:00.106 --> 01:12:02.105
Tea!

01:12:12.300 --> 01:12:13.300
Keep an eye on her while I
telephone her father

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:14.299
Very good, Sergeant

01:12:14.499 --> 01:12:16.298
Haven't you seen anyone with
a twitch?

01:12:16.498 --> 01:12:18.697
-There are too many people
-You must find him!

01:12:18.897 --> 01:12:20.896
Well, I can't ask them all if
they twitch, can l?

01:12:21.096 --> 01:12:23.495
We have bitten more than we can
chew

01:12:23.695 --> 01:12:25.094
He must be here, somewhere!

01:14:02.647 --> 01:14:05.046
What sort of twitch has he?
Just in one eye?

01:14:06.446 --> 01:14:08.645
No, both eyes

01:14:18.040 --> 01:14:21.039
I can't see nothing with all
these people crowding about

01:14:21.239 --> 01:14:23.837
-Can't we go to another table?
-No, we can't, they're all taken

01:14:24.037 --> 01:14:25.237
Oh, we've got to take a look
somehow

01:14:25.636 --> 01:14:28.835
-What about dancing?
-Can you dance?

01:14:29.035 --> 01:14:31.434
No, of course not, duckie, but I
don't mind having a go

01:14:31.634 --> 01:14:34.232
-It's only half walking, anyway
-Oh, well

01:14:34.432 --> 01:14:37.031
I wish I had my old boots

01:16:09.986 --> 01:16:13.185
I want you, old man

01:16:13.385 --> 01:16:14.984
Don't come in again like that

01:16:15.184 --> 01:16:18.582
It isn't funny and I pay someone
else to make the orchestrations

01:16:23.380 --> 01:16:26.378
-I'm afraid it's no good, duckie
-We mustn't give up

01:16:26.578 --> 01:16:29.377
The cops have been watching us
for the past quarter of an hour

01:16:29.577 --> 01:16:31.776
I know. I didn't think you had
noticed

01:16:31.976 --> 01:16:33.175
I didn't think you had either

01:16:33.375 --> 01:16:35.374
They're probably looking for
Mr. Tisdall

01:17:04.360 --> 01:17:05.959
I shouldn't take too many of
those, old man

01:17:06.159 --> 01:17:09.158
-I take as many as I want
-All right, all right

01:17:09.358 --> 01:17:11.957
I'm sorry, but I take them to
stop these twitches

01:17:12.156 --> 01:17:14.555
Got to be stopped somehow, it's
getting on my nerves

01:17:15.555 --> 01:17:17.354
Come on, boys, time's up

01:17:20.353 --> 01:17:22.352
I want to thank you for your
patience and your consideration

01:17:22.551 --> 01:17:24.551
The whole thing's beyond me.
Please, go in

01:17:24.750 --> 01:17:25.950
I'm sorry, Sir, but it can't be
helped

01:17:26.150 --> 01:17:29.148
Of course, do whatever you think

01:17:29.348 --> 01:17:30.548
There's nothing you need to do
to her

01:17:31.147 --> 01:17:33.346
I was saying there's nothing you
need to do to her

01:17:33.546 --> 01:17:34.946
It's all right, I'm not going to
give you any trouble

01:17:35.145 --> 01:17:36.345
It's a pity you didn't think that
sooner

01:17:36.545 --> 01:17:37.944
You might have saved a great
deal of trouble

01:17:38.144 --> 01:17:39.343
Go and take him inside, Sergeant

01:17:39.543 --> 01:17:41.542
I'm going to get Miss Burgoyne
and the old man

01:17:44.141 --> 01:17:45.740
Come on, boys

01:17:47.340 --> 01:17:50.138
-Where are they?
-Over there

01:17:50.338 --> 01:17:52.537
Ask them to come out, will you?

01:19:28.091 --> 01:19:32.489
Please, stand back, he needs air
Please, keep clear!

01:19:33.489 --> 01:19:35.488
All right, let's get along

01:19:41.685 --> 01:19:43.084
What's happened with the band,
waiter?

01:19:43.284 --> 01:19:44.883
I don't know, Sir, I was trying
to find the doctor

01:19:45.083 --> 01:19:46.283
They don't seem to do what to
do for him

01:19:48.282 --> 01:19:49.281
Can't we help?

01:19:49.481 --> 01:19:52.080
Your last efforts of first aid
weren't much of a success

01:19:52.280 --> 01:19:54.079
Can't you be human for once?

01:20:05.273 --> 01:20:07.272
Here, let me see

01:20:08.072 --> 01:20:10.071
-Get some brandy, Sir
-Certainly

01:20:13.070 --> 01:20:15.069
Will! Will!

01:20:22.865 --> 01:20:24.464
Look, Will, his eyes!

01:20:25.664 --> 01:20:27.463
Will someone wipe the black in
his face?

01:20:38.258 --> 01:20:40.257
It's him, Miss! It's him,
all right

01:20:47.253 --> 01:20:50.452
You gave the old tramp a
raincoat, didn't you?

01:20:53.450 --> 01:20:56.449
What did you do with the belt of
the raincoat?

01:20:56.649 --> 01:21:00.447
What did I do with the belt?

01:21:04.445 --> 01:21:08.243
I twisted it round her neck and
choked her life out of her

01:21:20.237 --> 01:21:22.236
I found him, it's all right,
it's over

01:21:38.229 --> 01:21:44.226
Father, don't you think we ought
to ask Mr. Tisdall to dinner?

01:21:45.305 --> 01:21:51.173
