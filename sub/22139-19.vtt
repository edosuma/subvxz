WEBVTT

00:02.903 --> 00:04.872
Guess who's also
having a baby?

00:04.905 --> 00:06.740
What?!

00:06.774 --> 00:07.908
Yay!

00:07.941 --> 00:09.910
I was gonna say your cheeks
were looking rounder,

00:09.943 --> 00:11.379
but I wasn't sure.

00:11.412 --> 00:14.315
I'm referring to my book -- "A
Case of a Knife to the Brain."

00:14.348 --> 00:16.484
I finally got
a publication date.

00:16.517 --> 00:18.386
What? Yay!

00:18.419 --> 00:19.887
You think my cheeks
are rounder?

00:19.920 --> 00:23.191
Hey, you should come to Key West
with me to celebrate.

00:23.224 --> 00:25.493
My doctor prescribed
rest and relaxation,

00:25.526 --> 00:27.061
and it might be the last time
I can get away

00:27.095 --> 00:28.096
before the baby arrives.

00:28.129 --> 00:29.663
Rest and relaxation?

00:29.697 --> 00:31.265
When I was pregnant
with Emery,

00:31.299 --> 00:34.102
I was working right up
until my contractions

00:34.135 --> 00:35.703
were under
a minute apart.

00:35.736 --> 00:38.239
And if you have
a dinner party...

00:38.272 --> 00:40.508
you can extend it

00:40.541 --> 00:43.010
with the
built-in...table leaf.

00:43.043 --> 00:44.112
Uh, oh,
we'll take it!

00:44.145 --> 00:46.114
Just please go to
the hospital.

00:46.147 --> 00:48.282
Of course you'll need chairs
to go with it!

00:48.316 --> 00:51.119
I appreciate the invite,
but I'm just too busy.

00:51.152 --> 00:53.954
I have to come up with a
treatment for my follow-up book.

00:53.987 --> 00:56.290
I have to think of talking
points for the book tour.

00:56.324 --> 00:59.527
But first, I need to
solicit praise quotes
for the book cover.

00:59.560 --> 01:01.095
The publishers have
already reached out

01:01.129 --> 01:02.596
to Dean Koontz
and Kenny Rogers,

01:02.630 --> 01:05.299
but I have my sights set
on the king -- Stephen King.

01:05.333 --> 01:07.468
Wow. You do have a lot
going on.
Yes.

01:07.501 --> 01:11.071
Ah, but remember, "All work and
no play makes Jack a dull boy."

01:11.105 --> 01:13.073
Is that some sort
of a joke?

01:13.107 --> 01:14.542
That's a line from
"The Shining."

01:14.575 --> 01:17.145
The movie,
not the book.

01:17.178 --> 01:20.448
That's Kubrick Kubricking
all over the work of a genius.

01:20.481 --> 01:23.151
See, this is the kind of junk
I need to get ahead of.

01:23.184 --> 01:25.586

All right, Koontz,
lay it on me.

01:42.370 --> 01:45.406
"Jessica Huang's debut book
shows a lot of promise

01:45.439 --> 01:48.409
in this cover-to-cover
mystery."

01:48.442 --> 01:49.710
Meh.

01:51.512 --> 01:54.114
The new restaurant sign
has arrived!

01:54.148 --> 01:55.583
Now that I've regained
full ownership,

01:55.616 --> 01:56.950
I'm putting my name
out front --

01:56.984 --> 01:59.320
"Louis Huang's
Cattleman's Ranch Steakhouse."

01:59.353 --> 02:01.255
I can't wait
to see her all lit up,

02:01.289 --> 02:03.624
especially since Emery
designed it.

02:03.657 --> 02:05.159
Emery: Sorry for all
the shaky lines.

02:05.193 --> 02:07.928
It's hard to draw at night when
the occupant of the bottom bunk

02:07.961 --> 02:09.963
shakes the bed
laughing at joke books.

02:09.997 --> 02:11.865
Well, at least your hand
doesn't get stepped on

02:11.899 --> 02:13.301
when the occupant
of the top bunk

02:13.334 --> 02:15.636
jumps down for
a middle-of-the-night pee!

02:18.138 --> 02:21.342
You're messing up
my filing system!

02:22.310 --> 02:23.377
Oh, my God.

02:23.411 --> 02:25.012
It's a letter
from Bangor, Maine!

02:25.045 --> 02:26.347
Stephen King wrote me!

02:27.648 --> 02:30.784
"Dear Jessica,
thanks for sharing your book.

02:30.818 --> 02:35.289
Unfortunately, I don't comment
on other authors' works.

02:35.323 --> 02:39.293
Happy scribbling,
Stephen King."

02:43.531 --> 02:44.565
Grandma: Ai-yah!

02:47.735 --> 02:50.971
**

02:51.004 --> 02:53.641
Spring dance tickets.
Love is in the air.

02:53.674 --> 02:55.709
No way. Dress up the gym
however you want,

02:55.743 --> 02:56.844
it's still extra school.

02:56.877 --> 03:00.648
I see. Noted.

03:00.681 --> 03:02.216
Planted in the curls.

03:02.250 --> 03:05.253
**

03:05.286 --> 03:06.820
I think it would be fun
to go.

03:06.854 --> 03:08.989
Nice to have someone to dance
with other than my mom.

03:09.022 --> 03:10.224
It's too late.

03:10.258 --> 03:12.726
At this point, we would have
to scramble to find dates.

03:12.760 --> 03:13.927
Let's go as a group!

03:13.961 --> 03:16.730
It's crazy that we're all single
at the same time.

03:16.764 --> 03:18.932
You've always been single.
Your whole time.

03:18.966 --> 03:22.570
I'm down to go as a group.
If it's cool, cool.

03:22.603 --> 03:25.072
If it sucks, it's still cool
because we're cool.

03:25.105 --> 03:27.441
Okay.
What are we gonna wear?

03:27.475 --> 03:29.610
We should pick a theme,
like Camelot.

03:29.643 --> 03:31.279
Or "Dusk till Dawn."

03:31.312 --> 03:32.913
Why do you like that movie
so much?

03:32.946 --> 03:34.014
You're right.

03:34.047 --> 03:35.749
It's just George Clooney
fighting vampires.

03:35.783 --> 03:37.217
Who would love that?

03:37.251 --> 03:38.686
What if we wear
the blue and orange tuxedos

03:38.719 --> 03:39.787
from "Dumb and Dumber"?

03:39.820 --> 03:43.624
**

03:43.657 --> 03:45.293
And the winner is...

03:45.326 --> 03:46.527
Nicole's idea!

03:46.560 --> 03:48.128
Of course that's what
we should wear.

03:48.161 --> 03:49.963
-100%
-Totally.

03:49.997 --> 03:51.231
That was Clooney?

03:52.833 --> 03:55.235
Thanks for coming
to what I hope is an...

03:55.269 --> 03:57.571
illuminating experience.

03:57.605 --> 04:00.474
Louis, sorry I will miss
your sign party.

04:00.508 --> 04:02.610
I decided to go on that trip
with Honey after all.

04:02.643 --> 04:04.612
Oh, thank God.

04:04.645 --> 04:06.647
Now I can just wing it
knowing you won't be yelling

04:06.680 --> 04:09.116
"Talk faster!"
in the middle of my speech.

04:09.149 --> 04:11.285
Everybody's bored!

04:11.319 --> 04:13.421
Remember that, since I won't
be there to tell you.

04:14.622 --> 04:18.125
**

04:22.330 --> 04:23.997
Ma, you want to go
check out the new sign?

04:24.031 --> 04:26.634
If it's not crowded, you could
do wheelies in the parking lot.

04:31.104 --> 04:32.139
What?

04:41.048 --> 04:42.316
You're moving out?

04:52.826 --> 04:55.629
I'm so happy
you changed your mind.

04:55.663 --> 04:57.498
And getting away from the book
will be healthy for you, too.

04:57.531 --> 04:59.833
I promise.
Hey, can you lean back
a little bit?

04:59.867 --> 05:03.003
I'm tracking a shifty-looking
Taurus in the side-view.

05:03.036 --> 05:04.037
Oops!

05:04.071 --> 05:06.474
Oh, you accidentally got on
95 North.

05:06.507 --> 05:08.008
We need South
for Key West.

05:08.041 --> 05:11.144
It wasn't an accident. We're
taking a quick detour to Maine.

05:11.178 --> 05:13.914
I just got to get that quote
from Stephen King first.

05:15.349 --> 05:17.518
Uhp, you're leaning
forward again.

05:24.157 --> 05:25.726
Maine? The big hat
on top of our country?

05:25.759 --> 05:27.395
That's 11 states away!

05:27.428 --> 05:29.497
I felt bad about
Stephen King's letter

05:29.530 --> 05:32.800
until I remembered reading that
his agent screens his mail.

05:32.833 --> 05:35.035
Stephen never even saw
my manuscript.

05:35.068 --> 05:38.138
If I can hand him a copy myself,
I know he'll read it,

05:38.171 --> 05:40.307
love it,
and write a glowing quote.

05:40.340 --> 05:43.176
Jessica, this is supposed to be
my chance to get away and relax.

05:43.210 --> 05:44.545
I packed for the beach.

05:44.578 --> 05:46.246
Maine has beaches.

05:46.279 --> 05:48.549
They just have more rocks
and family secrets.

05:50.350 --> 05:53.487
Look, just because it's
a different destination

05:53.521 --> 05:57.257
doesn't mean we can't still have
a fun and relaxing time.

05:57.290 --> 06:00.994
I have always wanted to see
New England.

06:01.028 --> 06:03.731
I've never seen
a craggy coastline in person.

06:03.764 --> 06:06.434
You know what?
Let's go to Maine!

06:06.467 --> 06:08.101
Yes!

06:08.135 --> 06:12.039
Don't get mad, but I invited
somebody else along.

06:12.072 --> 06:13.441
Miss Amy Grant.

06:13.474 --> 06:16.944
* Every heartbeat
bears your name *
Yes.

06:16.977 --> 06:19.279
* Loud and clear, they... *

06:21.715 --> 06:22.683
Jessica: Leave a message.

06:22.716 --> 06:24.585
Hey, Jessica, it's me.

06:24.618 --> 06:26.954
You're not gonna believe this.
My mom wants to move out.

06:26.987 --> 06:28.388
Call me back.

06:28.422 --> 06:29.890
Your mother's
moving out?

06:29.923 --> 06:32.292
Aw, I can't imagine
what that's like.

06:32.325 --> 06:34.595
That's because I don't deal
in hypotheticals.

06:34.628 --> 06:37.130
I mean, I'm a realist.

06:37.164 --> 06:39.232
In our culture, you never
leave your family.

06:39.266 --> 06:40.901
You get old,
you move in with your kids,

06:40.934 --> 06:42.570
and you sweep their driveway
until you die.

06:42.603 --> 06:44.638
She doesn't really
want to move out.

06:44.672 --> 06:47.374
She just wants to
feel appreciated.

06:47.407 --> 06:51.945
A beautiful bird like that
sitting around all day alone?

06:51.979 --> 06:53.714
Classic cry
for attention.

06:53.747 --> 06:56.584
Heck, Amy here threatens to run
off with Max's karate sensei

06:56.617 --> 06:57.918
twice a month.

06:57.951 --> 06:59.119
It's just
a little skit we do

06:59.152 --> 07:00.488
when I forget to
wash the dishes.

07:01.989 --> 07:03.957
It's just a little skit.

07:05.793 --> 07:08.496
Oh-ho-oh, goodness.

07:13.033 --> 07:15.636
Evan, I'm moving out.

07:15.669 --> 07:17.638
Grandma leaving means
her room's in play,

07:17.671 --> 07:18.939
so I'm gonna take it.

07:18.972 --> 07:20.307
What

07:20.340 --> 07:21.609
Remember in
"An American Tail"

07:21.642 --> 07:23.977
when Fievel the mouse
leaves Ukraine for America

07:24.011 --> 07:25.579
after hearing that
there are no cats

07:25.613 --> 07:27.280
and the streets are
paved with cheese?

07:27.314 --> 07:29.449
That's what Grandma's room
means to me --

07:29.483 --> 07:30.784
opportunity.

07:30.818 --> 07:33.120
We're not sharing
a room anymore?

07:33.153 --> 07:34.588
It's time, Evan.

07:34.622 --> 07:37.024
I mean, how long did you think
this was gonna last?

07:46.500 --> 07:49.136
Uh, vetoed.

07:49.169 --> 07:50.504
Get me the vice president!

07:50.538 --> 07:52.806
Yes, Dr. President?

07:52.840 --> 07:54.808
Never gets old!

07:57.077 --> 07:59.513
Hello, First Lady
Kristi Yamaguchi-Huang.

07:59.547 --> 08:01.649
Husband, what do you
feel like tonight?

08:01.682 --> 08:06.186
A '52 Fontaine Laroche
or a 1998 Red Antler Cabernet?

08:06.219 --> 08:07.287
Well, who's coming
to dinner?

08:07.320 --> 08:08.989
Your brother, Eddie.

08:09.022 --> 08:10.157
Both:
The Red Antler Cabernet.

08:12.560 --> 08:15.295
You really think you're gonna
marry Kristi Yamaguchi?

08:15.328 --> 08:18.465
Well, yeah, after I play
the field a little first.

08:18.498 --> 08:19.900
I'll tell you what
I'm not gonna miss --

08:19.933 --> 08:21.735
that cocky attitude
of yours.

08:21.769 --> 08:23.470
Well, if you're
so anxious to leave,

08:23.503 --> 08:25.438
why don't you grab your things
and get out of my room?

08:28.709 --> 08:30.510
Enjoy smelling like a lady,

08:30.544 --> 08:33.513
because Grandma's perfume is
never coming out of those walls!

08:36.617 --> 08:38.318
Welcome to Maine.

08:38.351 --> 08:40.487
It's freezing.

08:40.520 --> 08:42.522
I'm glad I got this sweatshirt
at a rest stop.

08:42.556 --> 08:43.891
Okay, let's go.

08:43.924 --> 08:46.159
I heard Stephen King is
a regular at the local diner.

08:46.193 --> 08:48.228
We'll wait for him there,
and I'll give him my book.

08:48.261 --> 08:49.329
But we just got here.

08:49.362 --> 08:50.564
Irma's on her way up
to show us

08:50.598 --> 08:53.333
which room the old
ship captain haunts!

08:55.569 --> 08:56.770
Did you see this?

08:56.804 --> 08:59.239
The PTA issued a new dress code
for the dance.

08:59.272 --> 09:01.008
"Boys must wear jackets
and ties.

09:01.041 --> 09:02.943
Girls must wear dresses
or skirts."

09:04.277 --> 09:06.947
So, Alison and I
can't wear tuxedos?

09:06.980 --> 09:09.382
Someone must've heard about our
plan and tipped off the PTA.

09:09.416 --> 09:14.421
**

09:14.454 --> 09:16.223
Me and Nicole can just wear
orange and blue dresses.

09:16.256 --> 09:19.292
I'll take blue,
so you're orange, right?

09:19.326 --> 09:20.961
Say it.
Say you're orange.

09:20.994 --> 09:22.529
The school can't tell me
what to wear.

09:22.562 --> 09:23.764
What's the big deal?

09:23.797 --> 09:25.699
Just wear a skirt.
You wear them all the time.

09:25.733 --> 09:27.367
Yeah, when I want to,

09:27.400 --> 09:30.303
not because the PTA can't handle
a chick in a suit.

09:30.337 --> 09:33.306
They expect everyone to look
and act a certain way.

09:33.340 --> 09:35.242
There's a term for that,
you know?

09:35.275 --> 09:37.444
No, I don't know.
What is it?

09:37.477 --> 09:38.979
"Gender conformity."

09:39.012 --> 09:40.113
That's what Anthony Kiedis

09:40.147 --> 09:41.749
from the Red Hot Chili Peppers
calls it.

09:41.782 --> 09:43.784
-No. Not Flea.

09:43.817 --> 09:45.052
Anthony Kiedis.

09:45.085 --> 09:46.620
I thought that was Flea's

her room into my office.

19:53.860 --> 19:56.162
It would help me separate work
from family.

19:56.195 --> 19:58.865
If you take
Grandma's room, then...

19:58.898 --> 20:00.567
I'd have to move back in
with Evan!

20:00.600 --> 20:01.934
Thank the Maker!

20:01.968 --> 20:03.870
**

20:06.239 --> 20:07.440
Happy to have you back.

20:07.474 --> 20:08.941
It's good to be back.

20:08.975 --> 20:10.577
Moms, welcome home!

20:10.610 --> 20:11.878
I wanna hear
all about your trip,

20:11.911 --> 20:13.946
but I gotta return
the skirt I wore to the dance

20:13.980 --> 20:15.782
and then go through
the yearbook with Nicole

20:15.815 --> 20:18.451
to find out who those bisexual
parking-lot sirens were.

20:22.655 --> 20:23.623
This!

20:23.656 --> 20:25.892
This is what you use
the cellphone for.

20:30.597 --> 20:31.698
...me as something more than
that. He wants to marry me.

20:31.731 --> 20:33.800
Oh-ho-ho, no.
He's not marrying you.

20:33.833 --> 20:35.868
Bangor. Maine.

20:35.902 --> 20:37.937
Stephen King
finally wrote me praise

20:37.970 --> 20:40.072
for "A Case of a Knife
to the Brain"!

20:40.106 --> 20:43.810
This is what persistence and
dedication can do for you, boys.

20:43.843 --> 20:45.978
Learn from this.

20:46.012 --> 20:48.648
"Dear Jessica Huang,
this is a restraining order

20:48.681 --> 20:50.116
issued to protect Stephen King

20:50.149 --> 20:52.452
pursuant to stalking him
at his local diner,

20:52.485 --> 20:53.620
harassing his plumber,

20:53.653 --> 20:56.756
and desecrating
his deceased cat's grave.

20:56.789 --> 20:59.959
Plaintiff Stephen King claims,

20:59.992 --> 21:02.629
'Jessica Huang is scarier
than any character

21:02.662 --> 21:04.196
I could ever write myself.'"

21:06.499 --> 21:11.338
**

21:11.371 --> 21:13.139
I knew Stephen
would come through.

21:13.172 --> 21:15.808
Look at us.
We made it.

21:15.842 --> 21:17.777
Moved here with
nothing but a dream.

21:17.810 --> 21:19.145
Now we own our home,

21:19.178 --> 21:21.614
both our names are displayed
on public signs,

21:21.648 --> 21:22.849
and our boys
have blossomed into --

21:22.882 --> 21:24.851
Already too long!
