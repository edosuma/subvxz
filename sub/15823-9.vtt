<i>Hi folks, you've reached Judy Lynn</i>
<i>The Last Women Standing.</i>

00:04.058 --> 00:05.925
<i>If you're calling for tickets</i>
<i>to Saturday's show,</i>

00:05.959 --> 00:07.126
<i>it's sold out.</i>

00:07.160 --> 00:08.460
<i>For future performance dates,</i>

00:08.495 --> 00:10.329
<i>plus the latest ravings</i>
<i>and rantings on my vlog,</i>

00:10.363 --> 00:13.698
<i>go to</i>
<i>www.last-woman-standing.com</i>

00:13.732 --> 00:15.369
<i>or if you'd like,</i>
<i>leave a message here.</i>

00:16.658 --> 00:19.726
<i>Hey, Judy.</i>
<i>Just wanted to hear your voice.</i>

00:19.761 --> 00:22.629
<i>And your father and I are dying</i>
<i>to learn how your night went.</i>

00:22.664 --> 00:25.132
<i>Call me.</i>
<i>Love you. Bye.</i>

00:27.168 --> 00:29.136
Man) <i>Okay.</i>(
<i>Trying you everywhere.</i>

00:29.170 --> 00:31.638
<i>I've left six messages</i>
<i>on your cell, and I'm worried.</i>

00:31.673 --> 00:32.738
<i>What's up?</i>

00:35.810 --> 00:37.578
<i>Hey, Judy,</i>
<i>your mother's getting worried</i>

00:37.612 --> 00:39.212
<i>because we haven't heard</i>
<i>from you.</i>

00:39.247 --> 00:42.215
<i>How's the show going?</i>
<i>Call when you have a second.</i>

00:44.252 --> 00:46.620
The air conditioner was
turned all the way down to 62,

00:46.654 --> 00:48.055
so it's hard to say,

00:48.089 --> 00:50.958
but I'm guessing she's been dead
at least 36 hours.

00:51.415 --> 00:55.415
<font color=#7fff00>The Closer 6x09</font>
<font color=#ffff00>Last Woman Standing</font>
Original Air Date on September 6, 2010

00:57.465 --> 00:58.765
Sexual assault?

00:58.800 --> 01:00.767
Sex, maybe.

01:00.802 --> 01:03.403
Uh, assault?

01:03.438 --> 01:05.639
There's a bottle of lubricant
on the floor over here.

01:05.673 --> 01:06.840
Peach flavored.

01:07.497 --> 01:11.097
-- Sync, corrected by <font color=#00ff00>elderman</font> --
-- for <font color=#00ffff>www.addic7ed.com</font> --

01:11.613 --> 01:16.016
Well, she's still got her wallet
with over $200 cash,

01:16.050 --> 01:18.518
so it's not a robbery.

01:18.553 --> 01:22.356
Man, that is
a nasty head wound.

01:22.390 --> 01:25.225
What happened to her lip?

01:25.259 --> 01:26.760
She bit it.

01:26.794 --> 01:29.730
The skull fracture
didn't kill her.

01:29.764 --> 01:32.866
She was smothered to death
with this pillow.

01:32.900 --> 01:35.802
It left blood transfer
on her face.

01:37.472 --> 01:40.040
See the threads
in her teeth?

01:41.943 --> 01:43.210
She was chewing
through this pillow,

01:43.244 --> 01:45.879
fighting to breathe.

01:45.913 --> 01:49.616
She knew she was dying.

01:49.651 --> 01:51.752
She knew it
up until her last breath.

01:55.123 --> 01:56.757
Anybody back there?
I am.

01:56.791 --> 01:58.558
Could you get me unplugged?

01:58.593 --> 01:59.760
Sure.

01:59.794 --> 02:01.962
Oh, I'm sorry, Chief.

02:01.996 --> 02:04.798
Uh, I'm just trying
to take this stuff with us.

02:04.832 --> 02:06.566
Right.

02:06.601 --> 02:07.768
Hi, Chief.

02:12.006 --> 02:13.740
Sorry it took me so long.
I'll take it from here.

02:13.775 --> 02:15.909
Captain Raydor's waiting.
One second, one second, Commander.

02:15.943 --> 02:17.044
Yes, Lieutenant?

02:17.078 --> 02:18.812
Yeah, so in case
you haven't seen her name

02:18.846 --> 02:20.113
on every poster
in the place,

02:20.148 --> 02:21.682
the victim's name
was Judy Lynn.

02:21.716 --> 02:24.918
She was
an actress/data-entry clerk.

02:24.952 --> 02:26.386
Building manager
says she lived alone,

02:26.421 --> 02:29.423
so there was no need
for a warrant.

02:29.457 --> 02:33.060
Her nails look perfect,

02:33.094 --> 02:34.795
so it wasn't much of a fight,
was it?

02:34.829 --> 02:36.096
Probably not.

02:36.130 --> 02:38.965
Looks like Judy was
either shoved or -- Julio? --

02:39.000 --> 02:41.435
or thrown into the wall.

02:41.469 --> 02:44.971
Smashes her head on the corner
of this picture frame, Chief.

02:45.006 --> 02:46.907
She falls,

02:46.941 --> 02:48.742
lies on the floor,
bleeding.

02:48.776 --> 02:50.711
Then gets carried
back to the bed

02:50.745 --> 02:52.379
to have a pillow put
over her face,

02:52.413 --> 02:54.347
which is like some kind
of weirdo thing to do.

02:54.382 --> 02:55.649
But she had
her nails done,

02:55.683 --> 02:56.750
had makeup on.

02:56.784 --> 02:57.984
Maybe she'd just been
on a date.

02:58.019 --> 02:59.486
Well, that's how
you meet weirdos.

02:59.520 --> 03:01.421
Chief...

03:01.456 --> 03:03.457
Uh, Buzz,
uh, if you have all this,

03:03.491 --> 03:05.392
would you please document
the body,

03:05.426 --> 03:07.327
especially the lips?

03:07.361 --> 03:09.129
Yes, Chief.
Thank you.

03:09.163 --> 03:12.099
Where's the gentleman who called this in?
He's in the living room.

03:16.070 --> 03:17.838
Uh, back here, please.

03:17.872 --> 03:21.108
Chief, you're supposed
to be preparing

03:21.142 --> 03:22.943
for your final interview
with the Mayor.

03:22.977 --> 03:24.244
Yeah, I'll need
to reschedule that.

03:24.278 --> 03:26.446
No, y-y-you can't do that.

03:26.481 --> 03:27.781
Look, Chief...

03:27.815 --> 03:29.282
I can handle
this investigation.

03:29.317 --> 03:31.485
You only caught this murder

03:31.519 --> 03:33.520
'cause Hollywood's got
no overtime left.

03:33.554 --> 03:36.423
Technically...
This isn't even a major crime.

03:37.492 --> 03:39.159
Why don't you tell
the victim's parents that?

03:39.193 --> 03:40.260
Excuse me.

03:43.498 --> 03:45.632
Uh, Stuart,
this is Chief Johnson.

03:45.666 --> 03:48.702
Chief, Stuart directed
the victim in a one-woman show.

03:48.736 --> 03:50.337
He also discovered
the body.

03:50.371 --> 03:54.074
This is like some kind
of cosmic mistake.

03:54.108 --> 03:55.442
I mean,
how could this happen?

03:55.476 --> 03:57.511
We're trying
to figure that out.

03:57.545 --> 03:59.212
Now, I'm just gonna ask you
a few questions

03:59.247 --> 04:01.481
and then we're gonna get you
a ride home, okay?

04:01.516 --> 04:03.617
Judy was
your...Colleague?

04:03.651 --> 04:05.619
Colleague?

04:05.653 --> 04:07.487
Yes,
she was my colleague.

04:07.522 --> 04:08.688
But she was --

04:08.723 --> 04:11.558
we were
very, very good friends.

04:12.627 --> 04:13.794
Oh, my God.

04:13.828 --> 04:16.997
A-and you dropped by
this morning because...

04:17.031 --> 04:19.533
Judy never misses
a tech rehearsal.

04:19.567 --> 04:21.434
So when she didn't show up
last night

04:21.469 --> 04:23.970
and didn't answer her phone
and never called me back,

04:24.005 --> 04:26.506
I knew something was wrong.
I knew it.

04:26.541 --> 04:29.509
So I drove over, and I-I made
Gifford open the door for me.

04:29.544 --> 04:31.444
Gifford is
the building manager.

04:31.479 --> 04:33.613
So was the door locked
when you got here?

04:33.648 --> 04:34.981
Yeah.
Dead bolt and bottom.

04:35.016 --> 04:37.184
Did you notice anyone visiting
Judy the night before last,

04:37.218 --> 04:39.152
or did she go out
with anyone?

04:39.187 --> 04:40.287
I don't know, really.

04:40.321 --> 04:42.022
The tenants mostly buzz up
their own guests.

04:42.056 --> 04:44.457
In a refreshing change
of pace,

04:44.492 --> 04:46.026
they have
working surveillance cameras

04:46.060 --> 04:47.294
at every entrance
and exit.

04:47.328 --> 04:49.930
Videos are here.
Okay.

04:49.964 --> 04:53.333
Okay, Stuart, I just have
a few more questions.

04:53.367 --> 04:55.836
Um, since you were
so close to Judy,

04:55.870 --> 04:58.238
c-can you tell me if she was
going out with anyone?

04:58.272 --> 05:00.173
The whole world
could tell you that.

05:00.208 --> 05:02.676
That's what her last
vlog posting was about.

05:02.710 --> 05:03.710
Her what?

05:03.744 --> 05:05.212
Well, you're police people,

05:05.246 --> 05:07.781
so you probably haven't heard
about her play,

05:07.815 --> 05:09.049
"Last Woman Standing"?

05:09.083 --> 05:10.951
Not before today. No.

05:10.985 --> 05:12.085
Okay, well...

05:12.119 --> 05:13.954
It was
actually an extension

05:13.988 --> 05:16.389
of this really popular vlog
she started,

05:16.424 --> 05:19.326
this online video diary
she kept

05:19.360 --> 05:21.528
on her struggle
to get work as an actor

05:21.562 --> 05:24.831
and how all the girls
that she started out with

05:24.866 --> 05:27.968
have basically given up
their own aspirations for men,

05:28.002 --> 05:30.437
which left Judy
the Last Woman Standing.

05:30.471 --> 05:32.939
The play
was a big success.

05:32.974 --> 05:34.608
Except --
I don't know --

05:34.642 --> 05:36.376
guys, they just completely
stopped asking her out,

05:36.410 --> 05:38.245
so she joined
an Internet dating site.

05:38.279 --> 05:40.247
and I --

05:40.281 --> 05:43.683
I sort of encouraged her
to do it.

05:43.718 --> 05:45.518
Oh, God.

05:45.553 --> 05:49.522
C-can you tell me the name
of this dating site?

05:49.557 --> 05:51.858
<i>LAGuysandDolls.com.</i>

05:51.893 --> 05:55.462
<i>And, yes, I chose it because</i>
<i>i'm a musical-theater whore.</i>

05:55.496 --> 05:56.730
Plus, it's free.

05:57.798 --> 05:59.933
So, I made up a user-name,

05:59.967 --> 06:02.068
since guys
won't ask me out anymore.

06:02.103 --> 06:03.670
However...

06:03.704 --> 06:05.005
Apparently,

06:05.039 --> 06:08.541
"Last Woman Standing"
made it seem like I hated men.

06:08.576 --> 06:09.743
And I don't.

06:10.945 --> 06:13.313
<i>In fact...</i>

06:13.347 --> 06:15.282
<i>I already have a date</i>
<i>with one.</i>

06:17.018 --> 06:18.218
But not to worry.

06:18.252 --> 06:20.720
I still won't
have to change myself

06:20.755 --> 06:23.323
to become what others expect,

06:23.357 --> 06:25.158
<i>because thanks to</i>
<i>LAGuysandDolls.com,</i>

06:25.192 --> 06:27.827
<i>I can create</i>
<i>a completely fake identity</i>

06:27.862 --> 06:30.263
<i>while still keeping</i>
<i>the one I have.</i>

06:30.298 --> 06:32.766
<i>Hey, you guys</i>
<i>want to see my profile?</i>

06:32.800 --> 06:34.367
Okay.

06:34.402 --> 06:36.670
Judy posted this video blog
entry to her server

06:36.704 --> 06:40.073
Tuesday evening, 7:05 P.M.

06:40.107 --> 06:41.675
<i>Oh, he's here.</i>

06:43.177 --> 06:45.779
<i>And, no, I am not gonna give</i>
<i>you his real name.</i>

06:45.813 --> 06:48.415
Well, of course not.
Why make our job any easier?

06:48.449 --> 06:51.117
<i>But online,</i>
<i>he goes by "Dreamweaver."</i>

06:51.152 --> 06:53.586
<i>And he's cute.</i>

06:53.621 --> 06:57.524
<i>Plus, he told me my picture</i>
<i>made me look like trouble.</i>

06:57.558 --> 06:58.925
Yeah,
I'll pass it along.

06:58.960 --> 07:00.593
Chief, Morales --

07:00.628 --> 07:01.828
hold on one second.

07:01.862 --> 07:03.096
<i>So --</i>
<i>Yes?</i>

07:03.130 --> 07:04.831
Morales
can't confirm rape,

07:04.865 --> 07:07.801
but he's got a good DNA sample
to go with all the fingerprints

07:07.835 --> 07:09.636
we got off the bottle
of lubricant.

07:09.670 --> 07:10.937
Thank you.

07:10.972 --> 07:13.840
<i>How do I look?</i>
<i>First date in over two years.</i>

07:13.874 --> 07:15.709
Okay -- Dreamweaver.

07:15.743 --> 07:16.810
Dreamweaver.

07:16.844 --> 07:20.113
<i>And, dad...Don't wait up.</i>

07:21.315 --> 07:22.849
No!

07:22.883 --> 07:25.051
We need to meet him.

07:25.086 --> 07:26.286
Yes, Lieutenant?

07:26.320 --> 07:28.288
I have Dreamweaver's profile
from the website.

07:28.322 --> 07:29.622
No photo and no passwords

07:29.657 --> 07:31.424
to either his
or Judy's account.

07:31.459 --> 07:34.861
"I like dinner and a movie.
How about you?

07:34.895 --> 07:36.963
"I work with my head,
train with my body,

07:36.998 --> 07:39.399
"live with my heart.

07:39.433 --> 07:41.634
Looking to get my smile back.
No drugs, please."

07:41.669 --> 07:44.671
She'd still want a picture before going
out with him, Chief.

07:44.705 --> 07:47.507
Yeah, Judy said he was cute,
so he must've sent her one.

07:47.541 --> 07:50.710
There's no photo in her e-mail.
Nothing about a date.

07:50.745 --> 07:53.179
That's not how it's done, Tao.

07:54.248 --> 07:56.716
What? I've tried it.

07:57.618 --> 07:59.452
The only way
to exchange info

07:59.487 --> 08:01.354
is through your account
on the website.

08:02.690 --> 08:06.059
Nothing else on her computer
about dating,

08:06.093 --> 08:07.527
just letters home,

08:07.561 --> 08:08.828
letters to agents.

08:08.863 --> 08:10.864
She communicated
with her cable provider.

08:10.898 --> 08:12.232
Lots of problems --

08:12.266 --> 08:15.368
trying to figure out when either
she or her building manager

08:15.403 --> 08:16.469
could let them in.

08:16.504 --> 08:17.737
Lots of appointments.

08:17.772 --> 08:19.906
Yeah, well,
damn cable companies.

08:19.940 --> 08:22.042
They say they're gonna be there
between 8:00 and 6:00.

08:22.076 --> 08:23.176
They show up at 7:00.

08:24.945 --> 08:26.413
You know,
she lived in an older building.

08:26.447 --> 08:29.249
Maybe she had a hard time
finding that sweet spot

08:29.283 --> 08:32.217
where television, computers,
phone, routers, all --

08:32.253 --> 08:34.187
uh, excuse me, Lieutenant.

08:34.221 --> 08:35.522
Um, Judy
and this Dreamweaver

08:35.556 --> 08:37.023
may have exchanged
phone numbers,

08:37.058 --> 08:39.826
so, uh, let's dump her phones
and see who she was talking to.

08:39.860 --> 08:42.828
Okay. And let's serve this dating site with
a warrant, please.

08:42.863 --> 08:44.931
I want to meet
Mr. Dreamweaver myself,

08:44.965 --> 08:46.933
and I want his account
information in full.

08:46.967 --> 08:47.934
Already on hold
with the judge.

08:47.968 --> 08:48.902
Chief?

08:48.936 --> 08:50.603
We're ready.

08:50.638 --> 08:52.739
So, we have footage
from all the security cameras

08:52.773 --> 08:54.407
from the victim's building.

08:54.442 --> 08:57.077
Okay, now,
the camera over the front door

08:57.111 --> 08:59.145
pans the whole area
at about a, what,

08:59.180 --> 09:01.781
135-degree arc, Gifford?

09:01.816 --> 09:04.584
Uh, well, the camera goes back
and forth all the time, yeah.

09:04.618 --> 09:07.954
Between 6:00
and 7:00 P.M., Gifford here says

09:07.988 --> 09:09.089
that all the people we see

09:09.123 --> 09:10.190
going in and out of the building
are tenants.

09:10.224 --> 09:12.125
Until 7:02,

09:12.159 --> 09:13.927
when this Camaro pulls up

09:13.961 --> 09:17.630
and the guy with the sports coat
here gets out.

09:17.665 --> 09:18.932
Never get a look
at his face.

09:18.966 --> 09:21.734
That's 'cause
he's texting the whole time.

09:21.769 --> 09:24.304
Do you know this man, Gifford?
I don't think so.

09:24.338 --> 09:26.473
Well, how do you know he's not
a tenant from the building?

09:27.608 --> 09:29.242
That's a 1970 Z28 Camaro.

09:29.276 --> 09:31.978
No one in our building
has a ride like that.

09:32.012 --> 09:33.279
Okay, now, Judy,
on the other hand,

09:33.314 --> 09:34.447
drives
a silver Nissan Altima.

09:34.482 --> 09:36.716
Which we have
on the security camera

09:36.750 --> 09:38.918
over the exit to the garage.

09:40.287 --> 09:42.088
Now, that's the victim
behind the wheel.

09:42.123 --> 09:44.924
Check out
the passenger's coat.

09:46.994 --> 09:48.795
Dreamweaver.

09:48.829 --> 09:50.163
They leave...

09:50.197 --> 09:52.799
Time passes...

09:52.833 --> 09:56.569
Dinner and a movie.
Why didn't they take his car?

09:56.604 --> 09:58.271
He had
a great parking spot,

09:58.305 --> 10:00.707
and -- I don't know --
maybe Judy wanted him

10:00.741 --> 10:02.742
to come up to her place
afterwards.

10:02.776 --> 10:04.377
Right.
Love at first sight.

10:04.411 --> 10:07.480
Judy's car comes back
at 11:03 P.M.

10:07.515 --> 10:09.949
Too dark to see anyone.

10:09.984 --> 10:11.651
More time passes...

10:11.685 --> 10:13.853
When, you know...

10:13.888 --> 10:15.922
He has sex with the girl
and then kills her.

10:15.956 --> 10:17.624
At least
I hope that's the order.

10:17.658 --> 10:20.994
And then here he comes again
at the front door.

10:21.028 --> 10:23.096
Now, we still don't see
his face, but look here.

10:23.130 --> 10:24.097
He stops.

10:24.131 --> 10:25.798
'Cause when the camera
pans back,

10:25.833 --> 10:26.833
he's still there.

10:26.867 --> 10:29.169
Why did he stand there
for so long?

10:29.203 --> 10:31.838
No idea, Chief.

10:33.541 --> 10:35.608
Hey. I've been looking for you.
Can we talk for a second?

10:35.643 --> 10:38.311
Sure.

10:40.648 --> 10:42.015
What is the deal here?

10:42.049 --> 10:44.551
The Mayor's expecting
to interview you tomorrow

10:44.585 --> 10:45.752
to be Chief,

10:45.786 --> 10:47.720
and now you want to cancel
that appointment?

10:47.755 --> 10:49.422
Look, I-I picked up a murder
this morning,

10:49.456 --> 10:51.024
and I just don't think that now --
come on.

10:51.058 --> 10:52.192
You've almost caught the guy
already.

10:52.226 --> 10:53.459
Taylor can take it from here.
No problem.

10:54.929 --> 10:55.962
Come on.

11:01.335 --> 11:02.769
What is going on?

11:02.803 --> 11:06.539
I've thought about it, will,
and honestly, I...

11:06.574 --> 11:09.042
I just -- I don't want to be
Chief of Police.

11:17.582 --> 11:19.450
Thank you.

11:19.484 --> 11:20.584
Captain.

11:20.619 --> 11:22.386
Chief,
thanks for making the time.

11:22.420 --> 11:25.322
Well, I hope
we're not wasting it.

11:25.357 --> 11:27.157
I think it might be Captain Raydor who's
been wasting her time,

11:27.192 --> 11:28.826
since she's spent hours
waiting for you

11:28.860 --> 11:30.661
and days figuring out how to
prepare you

11:30.695 --> 11:32.563
for what may be
a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity

11:32.597 --> 11:34.832
to be the next Chief.

11:34.866 --> 11:37.067
So, when you say you're
not interested in the job,

11:37.102 --> 11:38.636
it's --
it's very disappointing.

11:38.670 --> 11:40.404
Didn't you tell me yourself

11:40.438 --> 11:43.173
that I had no real chance
at being Chief?

11:43.208 --> 11:45.576
That you were only permitting me
to submit an ap--

11:45.610 --> 11:47.378
excuse me? Permission?
No, that's -- that's --

11:47.412 --> 11:48.846
that's not what I said.
I did not say that.

11:48.880 --> 11:50.381
Yes, you did.

11:50.415 --> 11:53.083
You permitted me to apply
as a sort of stalking horse --

11:53.118 --> 11:54.685
you did not.

11:54.719 --> 11:57.521
I did not
give her permission.

11:58.456 --> 11:59.924
Okay,
I think we can all agree

11:59.958 --> 12:01.091
that there were
some serious flaws

12:01.126 --> 12:04.328
in my approach
to campaign to be Chief.

12:04.362 --> 12:06.196
For one thing,
I'm no longer in the running.

12:06.231 --> 12:07.765
But it is now
in my best interest --

12:07.799 --> 12:09.900
in all of our
best interest --

12:09.935 --> 12:11.569
that the Mayor appoint you
as our next boss.

12:11.603 --> 12:13.537
And if you
just quit now...

12:13.572 --> 12:15.606
People will think
you're hiding something.

12:15.640 --> 12:17.308
Or worse,
you'll seem like a flake

12:17.342 --> 12:18.943
or like you broke
under pressure.

12:18.977 --> 12:21.545
Whatever you do, you can't
just cancel this interview,

12:21.580 --> 12:22.780
and you can't reschedule.

12:22.814 --> 12:25.015
Because when the Mayor calls
for a meeting

12:25.050 --> 12:26.150
with his Chief of Police,

12:26.184 --> 12:27.952
he expects him -- or her --
to show up.

12:27.986 --> 12:30.087
Well, when people are smothered
to death in their homes,

12:30.121 --> 12:31.422
they expect me
to show up, too.

12:31.456 --> 12:34.258
Okay, I don't know what
it was like in Atlanta, honey,

12:34.292 --> 12:37.461
but when you apply for
Chief of police in Los Angeles

12:37.495 --> 12:40.731
and you don't get the job,
there are big consequences.

12:40.765 --> 12:41.966
Yeah, first, I get fired.

12:42.000 --> 12:43.367
You don't know that.

12:43.401 --> 12:46.503
And then,
every success he's had,

12:46.538 --> 12:48.872
like, uh, Major Crimes,
for instance,

12:48.907 --> 12:51.308
well, that gets
completely dismantled.

12:51.343 --> 12:53.210
Chief...

12:53.244 --> 12:55.813
If you don't at least <i>attend</i>
<i>this final interview,</i>

12:55.847 --> 12:59.783
the women of the L.A.P.D.
will be completely demoralized,

12:59.818 --> 13:02.486
and many of them
will never forgive you.

13:02.520 --> 13:03.687
Ever.

13:06.191 --> 13:09.493
Well, can I just skip
the whole prep part?

13:09.527 --> 13:11.929
I'll just go in there
and be myself.

13:11.963 --> 13:14.665
That is a terrible idea.

13:16.134 --> 13:17.835
Come in.

13:17.869 --> 13:19.003
Excuse me.

13:19.037 --> 13:20.404
Uh, Chief,
we don't have an address,

13:20.438 --> 13:22.406
a work history,
or a social yet,

13:22.440 --> 13:25.042
but the warrant
on the dating site

13:25.076 --> 13:27.311
got us a name
and a picture.

13:27.345 --> 13:28.746
Meet Marc Torres,

13:28.780 --> 13:31.415
A.K.A. Dreamweaver.

13:31.449 --> 13:33.450
Have a good idea where to find him.
Where?
Where?

13:34.419 --> 13:35.853
He's got another date.

13:35.887 --> 13:38.155
This afternoon.

13:41.526 --> 13:43.360
Well, we can't arrest him

13:43.395 --> 13:46.296
unless we match his DNA
to what was found in the victim.

13:46.331 --> 13:47.898
So let's keep him
under tight surveillance

13:47.932 --> 13:49.566
over the next two days
and try and get --

13:52.070 --> 13:53.404
for heaven's sake, Commander,

13:53.438 --> 13:55.139
y-you know how to handle this,
don't you?

13:55.173 --> 13:57.808
Yes. Thank you.

13:59.177 --> 14:00.310
Uh...

14:00.345 --> 14:03.313
Let's go, Detective.
Come on.

14:03.348 --> 14:04.682
Okay. Uh, sure.

14:04.716 --> 14:06.116
Thank you.

14:08.000 --> 14:14.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

14:24.402 --> 14:26.003
Hey, guys.

14:26.037 --> 14:27.971
Hey, guy, Torres is here.

14:28.006 --> 14:29.840
I got the plate on his Camaro.
You ready?

14:29.874 --> 14:34.678
That's 3, Henry, X-ray,
Lincoln, 8, 0, 7.

14:34.713 --> 14:36.046
Did you get that?

14:36.081 --> 14:39.249
I lost my Web connection.
I lost Sanchez.

14:42.921 --> 14:45.889
Here. You can hook up to
the Internet with my overdrive.

14:45.924 --> 14:47.458
Password's there.
Hmm.

14:48.860 --> 14:49.893
Cool.

14:55.100 --> 14:56.567
Okay, Taylor,

14:56.601 --> 14:59.036
the dirtbag is going
into the coffee shop now.

14:59.070 --> 15:01.505
Can we get
to his vehicle?

15:04.843 --> 15:08.545
Julio says
Torres will have his back to us.

15:08.580 --> 15:11.582
Did you read what he wrote
to the new girl he's meeting?

15:11.616 --> 15:12.850
"Great picture.

15:12.884 --> 15:14.251
"I've read your profile,

15:14.285 --> 15:17.020
but, to be completely honest,
you look like trouble."

15:17.055 --> 15:19.323
That's the exact same thing
he said to Judy.

15:19.357 --> 15:20.557
Well, it worked.

15:20.592 --> 15:23.694
This guy made over 11 dates
on this site

15:23.728 --> 15:25.062
using the same line.

15:25.096 --> 15:26.263
Taylor?

15:26.297 --> 15:27.898
We're checking
on all those girls

15:27.932 --> 15:28.932
to make sure they're okay.

15:28.967 --> 15:30.400
Listen up.

15:30.435 --> 15:33.270
I just got Marc Torres' address
from dmv.

15:33.304 --> 15:36.340
If we're going to get
a search warrant for his home,

15:36.374 --> 15:38.075
now looks like a perfect time.

15:38.109 --> 15:41.278
What makes tomorrow better
than any other day?

15:41.312 --> 15:43.413
Because the Mayor's
just finished interviewing

15:43.448 --> 15:45.549
the other four applicants
for Chief of Police.

15:45.583 --> 15:46.950
And you're the only woman,

15:46.985 --> 15:48.986
so you'll make
for a vivid contrast.

15:49.020 --> 15:52.389
I think
that we should capitalize

15:52.423 --> 15:54.892
on your
feminine strengths.

15:54.926 --> 15:56.026
Which are?

15:56.060 --> 15:58.996
Uh, don't take this
the wrong way, Chief.

15:59.030 --> 16:00.931
Because
I have always admired

16:00.965 --> 16:03.801
with how little you care
about current fashion.

16:03.835 --> 16:05.435
And the -- the purse.

16:05.470 --> 16:06.637
That...

16:06.671 --> 16:07.805
That purse.

16:07.839 --> 16:09.439
Come on.
That -- the -- the purse.

16:11.676 --> 16:14.912
This purse helps people
underestimate you,

16:14.946 --> 16:17.147
which I think,
you know, is a good thing

16:17.182 --> 16:18.816
when it comes
to criminals.

16:18.850 --> 16:21.084
But the Mayor -- he's somebody
you really want to impress,

16:21.119 --> 16:22.452
so I was wondering
if we could --

16:22.487 --> 16:24.755
you know, Captain,
I have a lot of nice clothes.

16:24.789 --> 16:26.390
I just don't like
to overdress at work.

16:26.424 --> 16:28.492
Absolutely.

16:28.526 --> 16:29.726
And you know what?

16:29.761 --> 16:31.328
There's no one that would ever
accuse you of that.

16:31.362 --> 16:34.565
But we want the Mayor's
first impression of you

16:34.599 --> 16:38.802
to be as a woman capable
of handling a lot of power,

16:38.837 --> 16:41.638
to look at you
and think something like...

16:43.641 --> 16:44.908
Wow.

16:44.943 --> 16:46.476
You look great.

16:46.511 --> 16:47.744
You too.
You too.

16:47.779 --> 16:49.046
It's always a relief

16:49.080 --> 16:51.782
when people resemble
their pictures a little.

16:51.816 --> 16:53.483
Well, you look even better
than yours.

16:59.457 --> 17:00.858
You know,
I had a speech ready,

17:00.892 --> 17:01.859
just in case your first
inclination was to run.

17:01.893 --> 17:03.360
Which was?

17:03.394 --> 17:06.262
I know that I'm maybe
not what you had in mind...

17:06.297 --> 17:08.432
You mean
because I'm a woman.

17:08.465 --> 17:10.099
No. No, no.

17:10.134 --> 17:13.237
Because most candidates
for Chief of Police

17:13.271 --> 17:15.137
run popularity contests,

17:15.173 --> 17:17.140
and you're not
especially political,

17:17.175 --> 17:18.842
well-liked,
or even friendly.

17:18.877 --> 17:21.778
I'm not interested
in politics at all.

17:21.813 --> 17:22.846
Exactly.

17:22.881 --> 17:24.982
And therefore,
you won't blame the Mayor

17:25.016 --> 17:26.550
for the L.A.P.D.'S
budgetary crisis

17:26.584 --> 17:28.385
or publicly demand
that he fix it.

17:28.419 --> 17:29.987
Chief...

17:31.689 --> 17:32.689
Okay.

17:32.724 --> 17:33.857
There is a reason

17:33.892 --> 17:36.326
that this is a short meeting
in the afternoon,

17:36.361 --> 17:38.495
because all the Mayor
really wants to know is

17:38.529 --> 17:41.398
how the two of you
will get along.

17:41.432 --> 17:42.633
I hope you don't mind

17:42.667 --> 17:45.535
this little -- I don't know --
speed date.

17:45.570 --> 17:47.804
Oh, no. I get it.
Totally.

17:47.839 --> 17:49.339
Think of it as a...

17:49.374 --> 17:50.874
Chemistry test.

18:05.123 --> 18:08.058
And there was this one thing
I wanted to know about.

18:08.092 --> 18:09.059
What thing?

18:09.093 --> 18:11.895
"Honestly,
you look like trouble"?

18:11.930 --> 18:14.531
What did you mean by that?

18:15.900 --> 18:17.000
Look...

18:17.035 --> 18:18.468
I got dumped
about a year ago.

18:20.405 --> 18:23.340
And I wasn't sure
that I was, you know,

18:23.374 --> 18:26.109
ready to put myself
back out there.

18:26.144 --> 18:29.346
But then I saw your profile
and your picture.

18:29.380 --> 18:31.782
<i>I don't know.</i>
<i>My heart moved a little.</i>

18:31.816 --> 18:33.817
No way this rap works.

18:33.851 --> 18:35.218
Yeah.

18:35.253 --> 18:38.822
If it does,
I'll be using it word for word.

18:38.856 --> 18:40.857
<i>Maybe it's just me, but...</i>

18:40.892 --> 18:42.459
<i>That sounded</i>
<i>a little rehearsed.</i>

18:42.493 --> 18:44.261
You tell him, Jenny.

18:44.295 --> 18:46.563
<i>Wow.</i>
<i>You're a little cynical.</i>

18:46.597 --> 18:48.198
No.

18:48.232 --> 18:49.733
I'm a lot cautious.

18:56.975 --> 19:00.944
So, I stuck the tracking device
underneath the front fender.

19:00.979 --> 19:05.782
So now, let's see what we have
in the way of...

19:05.817 --> 19:09.286
Fingerprints, Mr. Torres.

19:09.320 --> 19:11.955
I have to get back
to work.

19:11.990 --> 19:13.123
Yeah.

19:13.157 --> 19:15.459
Um...

19:15.493 --> 19:17.361
So...

19:17.395 --> 19:18.528
Movies next week or...?

19:18.563 --> 19:19.663
Maybe.

19:20.798 --> 19:21.798
All right.

19:21.833 --> 19:23.100
Bye.

20:03.007 --> 20:05.075
All right, Buzz.
Let's go.

20:19.190 --> 20:21.058
Little update, Chief?
Right.

20:21.092 --> 20:22.426
Pardon me.

20:22.460 --> 20:24.061
We got our DNA sample
from Torres,

20:24.095 --> 20:25.662
and it's off to the lab.

20:25.696 --> 20:29.332
We also matched fingerprints
off his car

20:29.367 --> 20:30.934
to those
in the victim's apartment.

20:30.968 --> 20:35.372
Now, Tao thinks he might've
paused outside Judy's building

20:35.406 --> 20:38.141
because someone keyed his car
while he was inside.

20:38.176 --> 20:39.276
We don't know.

20:39.310 --> 20:40.510
Look,
we have a problem.

20:40.545 --> 20:42.279
What's that?

20:44.082 --> 20:46.316
Marc Torres
is on another date.

20:46.350 --> 20:48.018
What?!

20:48.052 --> 20:50.520
The young Lady was waiting
for him on a corner in Larchmont Village.

20:50.555 --> 20:52.289
We don't know who she is
or where she came from.

20:52.323 --> 20:54.157
What we do know is

20:54.192 --> 20:55.625
that he took her
to dinner and a movie.

20:55.660 --> 20:57.094
Just like Judy.
And now?

20:57.128 --> 20:58.261
Now he's just parked

20:58.296 --> 21:01.264
beneath an apartment building
on Melrose.

21:01.299 --> 21:03.867
But, uh...
It's not his home address.

21:03.901 --> 21:05.702
Chief, you already --
one second.
One second.

21:05.736 --> 21:07.337
Commander,
under no circumstances

21:07.371 --> 21:08.905
is Marc Torres
to be left alone

21:08.940 --> 21:10.674
with another woman
in her apartment.

21:10.708 --> 21:13.210
Got it.
Thank you.

21:13.244 --> 21:15.178
Spot 42.
42!

21:15.213 --> 21:16.379
Whose spot is that?!

21:16.414 --> 21:17.681
Uh, apartment 207.

21:17.715 --> 21:20.150
All right, take us there!
Come on, take us!

21:23.855 --> 21:24.988
Let's go!

21:26.224 --> 21:28.325
Come on!

21:28.893 --> 21:30.393
Whoa! Whoa!

21:30.428 --> 21:31.695
What the hell?!

21:31.729 --> 21:33.130
What are you doing?!

21:34.732 --> 21:36.833
L.A.P.D., Mr. Torres!

21:36.868 --> 21:38.401
Now, you stop moving!

21:38.436 --> 21:41.304
What did I do?
Ow! What did I do?

21:41.339 --> 21:43.540
What are you doing?!
We're saving your life!

21:43.574 --> 21:44.774
From my fiancÃ©?!

21:46.944 --> 21:48.044
FiancÃ©?

21:48.079 --> 21:50.547
Why are you treating Marc
like this?

21:53.784 --> 21:56.686
To be completely honest
with you, ma'am,

21:56.721 --> 21:58.522
he looks like trouble.

22:08.663 --> 22:10.663
So unless you are arrested
this Dreamweaver idiot

22:10.719 --> 22:12.187
for cheating on his fiancÃ©e --

22:12.221 --> 22:15.023
not a criminal offense, by the way --
we got nothing on him.

22:15.057 --> 22:17.992
I gave the order to arrest
Marc Torres, not them.

22:18.027 --> 22:20.261
I was with you.
You did not give that order.

22:20.296 --> 22:21.830
Yeah,
you were not in charge.

22:21.864 --> 22:22.964
It was either Taylor
or Provenza

22:22.998 --> 22:24.833
who made the call
to break in without a warrant.

22:24.867 --> 22:26.367
So, why did you think
it was worth it

22:26.402 --> 22:29.003
to bust in on this couple without
enough evidence to hold this guy?

22:29.038 --> 22:30.271
You mean besides the fact

22:30.306 --> 22:33.174
that he killed his date
from the night before last?

22:33.209 --> 22:35.510
Did you want us
to let him murder someone

22:35.544 --> 22:37.946
while under
L.A.P.D. surveillance?

22:37.980 --> 22:40.014
Because then we could have
held him without any problems.

22:40.049 --> 22:41.516
But we won't have
any problems anyway

22:41.550 --> 22:43.585
if you let me just talk
to the guy for 10 minutes.

22:43.619 --> 22:45.520
I really don't
want her involved.

22:45.554 --> 22:47.755
Uh, excuse me.

22:47.790 --> 22:51.192
Uh, do you really need me
to ask this guy these questions?

22:51.227 --> 22:52.260
Yes. Thank you.

22:52.294 --> 22:53.795
We can arrest Marc Torres
in 10 minutes

22:53.829 --> 22:56.130
if everyone will just calm down
and let me do my job.

22:56.165 --> 22:58.333
Okay? May I?

22:58.367 --> 23:01.369
I thought y'all wanted me
to be your boss.

23:01.937 --> 23:03.004
Gentlemen.

23:04.473 --> 23:05.473
Captain.

23:08.444 --> 23:09.677
Mr. Torres,

23:09.712 --> 23:12.046
I'm deputy Chief Brenda leigh Johnson
of the L.A.P.D.,

23:12.081 --> 23:14.782
and this is Special Agent
Fritz Howard of the FBI.

23:14.817 --> 23:17.385
We want to thank you so much
for cooperating with us.

23:17.419 --> 23:18.887
Why the hell am I here?

23:18.921 --> 23:20.555
We're just about to get
to the bottom of that.

23:20.589 --> 23:21.990
Detective Sanchez,
would you please

23:22.024 --> 23:24.859
<i>uncuff Marc, here,</i>
<i>so that he's comfortable?</i>

23:26.161 --> 23:27.862
<i>Thank you so much.</i>

23:27.897 --> 23:30.198
<i>All right, then,</i>
<i>first things first.</i>

23:30.232 --> 23:32.533
<i>The FBI has a few questions</i>
<i>that they need you to answer</i>

23:32.568 --> 23:34.636
because of
a computer server issue.

23:34.670 --> 23:36.070
We've got
your fiancÃ©e, Debbie,

23:36.105 --> 23:37.605
waiting for you
in the next room.

23:37.640 --> 23:40.441
Agent Howard,
if you'd like to start.

23:40.476 --> 23:43.578
Mr. Torres...

23:43.612 --> 23:46.047
Do you know this woman,
Judy Lynn?

23:46.081 --> 23:48.917
Uh,
you said Debbie's here?

23:48.951 --> 23:51.920
She is, waiting for you.
And she's very confused.

23:51.954 --> 23:53.888
Chief Johnson,
do you mind?

23:53.923 --> 23:55.189
Oh, no. Not at all.
So sorry.

23:55.224 --> 23:56.224
Go ahead.

23:56.258 --> 23:58.393
Do you know this woman,
Judy Lynn?

23:58.427 --> 24:00.194
No.

24:00.229 --> 24:01.262
No.

24:01.297 --> 24:02.730
Did --

24:04.033 --> 24:06.601
did you go on a date with her
the night before last?

24:06.635 --> 24:08.436
Nope.
No.

24:08.470 --> 24:10.571
Were you ever in her apartment?
No.

24:10.606 --> 24:12.006
No.

24:12.041 --> 24:13.274
Did you ever
have sex with her?

24:13.309 --> 24:14.509
Of course not.

24:14.543 --> 24:15.610
<i>I'm engaged. God.</i>

24:15.644 --> 24:18.413
That's great, just great.
Brilliant.

24:18.447 --> 24:19.881
<i>That's all for me.</i>

24:19.915 --> 24:22.216
<i>I believe Chief johnson</i>
<i>has some questions for you now.</i>

24:22.251 --> 24:24.752
Do you know this woman, Judy Lynn?
I just told you no.

24:25.688 --> 24:27.255
Here is
all the communication,

24:27.289 --> 24:30.758
including pictures
and e-mails exchanged

24:30.793 --> 24:31.960
between you
and Judy Lynn,

24:31.994 --> 24:34.195
using an Internet
dating website

24:34.229 --> 24:37.198
called LAGuysandDolls.com.

24:38.667 --> 24:40.368
That's Judy?

24:40.402 --> 24:44.272
Uh, well, yeah, I-I might've
written to her maybe,

24:44.306 --> 24:45.740
but she looks different
than her other photos.

24:45.774 --> 24:48.242
Did you ever go
to her apartment?

24:48.277 --> 24:49.344
No. Never.

24:51.246 --> 24:55.283
These are pictures
taken from the security cameras

24:55.317 --> 24:57.986
above the front door
of Judy Lynn's building.

24:58.020 --> 25:02.490
You'll notice you
in your sport coat

25:02.524 --> 25:04.092
exiting your vehicle

25:04.126 --> 25:08.229
<i>and again, here,</i>
<i>entering the building.</i>

25:09.865 --> 25:12.367
Wow. Um...

25:12.401 --> 25:14.502
I-I know somebody
who lives in that same place.

25:14.536 --> 25:16.004
So...

25:16.038 --> 25:17.638
That's a coincidence.

25:17.673 --> 25:19.374
Really?

25:21.510 --> 25:25.179
Here is a fingerprint that
was taken off of your vehicle.

25:25.214 --> 25:26.514
And this one...

25:26.548 --> 25:29.951
Was taken
from inside Judy's apartment

25:29.985 --> 25:32.954
off a bottle
of peach-flavored lubricant.

25:32.988 --> 25:34.655
They match perfectly.

25:34.690 --> 25:38.226
Is that a coincidence, too,
Mr. Torres?

25:40.229 --> 25:42.196
Did you have sex
with Judy Lynn?

25:42.231 --> 25:45.066
Because
Detective Sanchez here

25:45.100 --> 25:48.036
took a straw that you were using
from your date this afternoon,

25:48.070 --> 25:50.605
and if the DNA that we collected
off that straw

25:50.639 --> 25:52.206
matches what we found
in Judy Lynn --

25:52.241 --> 25:54.042
<i>all right!</i>
<i>What do you want from me?</i>

25:54.076 --> 25:57.211
<i>I went on a date with her.</i>
<i>We had sex.</i>

25:57.246 --> 25:58.880
<i>And then I got out of there</i>
<i>as fast as I could.</i>

25:58.914 --> 26:00.615
Because you know what?
She kind of freaked me out.

26:00.649 --> 26:02.116
Freaked you out how?

26:02.151 --> 26:03.951
When we got to her place,
she practically attacked me.

26:03.986 --> 26:05.953
A-and then -- then
she got all hysterical

26:05.988 --> 26:07.221
when I told her
I had to leave.

26:07.256 --> 26:10.158
And she keyed my car
when I was in the shower.

26:10.192 --> 26:11.225
Bitch.

26:11.260 --> 26:12.360
Judy attacked you?

26:13.996 --> 26:16.130
Did y'all
get into a fight?

26:16.165 --> 26:18.800
Because I don't know what she
looked like when you left her,

26:18.834 --> 26:20.134
but here's how she looked
when I met her.

26:24.173 --> 26:26.541
The night
y'all went to the movies,

26:26.575 --> 26:28.276
Judy Lynn
was brutally murdered.

26:28.310 --> 26:30.711
And now, Mr. Torres,
you lied about knowing her,

26:30.746 --> 26:32.280
you lied about going
on a date with her,

26:32.314 --> 26:33.848
you lied about being
in her apartment,

26:33.882 --> 26:36.050
and you lied
about having sex with her!

26:36.085 --> 26:38.352
When you say it all out loud
like that, it sounds pretty bad.

26:38.387 --> 26:41.389
Yeah, I lied.

26:41.423 --> 26:42.924
My fiancÃ©e's
in the next room.

26:42.958 --> 26:45.226
I didn't even know
what this was about, all right?

26:45.260 --> 26:46.494
But I have a lot of cops
in my family,

26:46.528 --> 26:49.564
and you don't have
enough evidence to hold me.

26:49.598 --> 26:51.499
And lying to the police
isn't against the law.

26:51.533 --> 26:53.167
That's true.

26:53.202 --> 26:54.936
But it is a crime
to lie to the FBI.

26:57.739 --> 26:59.540
That means you're under arrest,
Mr. Torres.

27:01.743 --> 27:03.377
Yeah?

27:03.412 --> 27:05.580
<i>You want to play it</i>
<i>that way?</i>

27:05.614 --> 27:06.981
<i>I want a lawyer.</i>

27:07.015 --> 27:10.485
Well, let's hope his DNA matches
what we found in the victim.

27:10.519 --> 27:13.955
Will you make sure she gets
across the street tomorrow?

27:13.989 --> 27:15.857
I'll walk her myself.

27:17.693 --> 27:20.094
I'll open a file on him
if you want.

27:20.129 --> 27:22.463
But when he's arraigned,
you're gonna want to swap

27:22.498 --> 27:24.932
those "lying to a federal agent"
charges with murder.

27:24.967 --> 27:27.602
Well, that's something
to look forward to.

27:27.636 --> 27:30.338
Don't be late.
You got a big day tomorrow.

27:34.276 --> 27:36.644
So everyone keeps telling me.

27:41.416 --> 27:42.783
It's not how it looks.

27:42.818 --> 27:45.820
If he were a drunk, of course,
it would be more obvious,

27:45.854 --> 27:48.956
but addiction
is addiction.

27:48.991 --> 27:51.425
And he just
fell off the wagon.

27:51.460 --> 27:55.163
Ms. Shriner, your fiancÃ© has had
11 dates that we know of

27:55.197 --> 27:56.564
over the past two weeks.

27:56.598 --> 27:59.934
Look, your boyfriend didn't
just "fall off the wagon."

27:59.968 --> 28:01.269
He jumped with both feet.

28:02.738 --> 28:04.071
And then he pushed the wagon
over the cliff.

28:04.106 --> 28:06.874
It's not Marc.
It's the disease.

28:06.909 --> 28:10.211
And these
horribly enabling women

28:12.881 --> 28:15.283
these -- these whores.

28:15.317 --> 28:16.584
I hate them!

28:17.653 --> 28:20.021
Sorry for interrupting.

28:20.055 --> 28:22.924
Um...

28:22.958 --> 28:26.260
Pardon me, Ms. Shriner.

28:29.831 --> 28:32.266
I was going through
Judy's computer,

28:32.301 --> 28:34.936
and I found the last entry
to her vlog.

28:34.970 --> 28:36.204
Mm-hmm.

28:36.238 --> 28:39.974
But...She died
before posting it.

28:40.008 --> 28:41.442
Thank you.

28:42.311 --> 28:44.879
You got the left to the right
and the right to the left.

28:44.913 --> 28:47.348
Yes, that -- left.
Oh, for heaven's sakes!

28:47.382 --> 28:48.716
No, the right --
terrible, terrible.

28:48.750 --> 28:49.750
Yeah, you got it.

28:53.789 --> 28:55.156
<i>Okay.</i>

28:57.292 --> 29:00.127
<i>I can't talk...Long, but...</i>

29:02.531 --> 29:06.701
<i>This is raw, all right.</i>

29:06.735 --> 29:10.571
He said that...
I gave him that rush you feel

29:10.606 --> 29:14.108
when you meet
the first person you like

29:14.142 --> 29:17.311
who really likes you back.

29:17.346 --> 29:19.914
And...

29:19.948 --> 29:22.917
I fell for it.

29:22.951 --> 29:26.454
And then the second --
and I mean the <i>very</i> second --

29:26.488 --> 29:28.256
he was through,

29:28.290 --> 29:31.192
he got off me
and he said he had to go

29:31.226 --> 29:34.629
and could he
take a shower first.

29:37.032 --> 29:39.734
<i>God, I'm an idiot.</i>

29:43.372 --> 29:45.806
<i>Last woman dating</i>
<i>is officially over.</i>

29:47.075 --> 29:49.577
<i>But not before the part</i>
<i>where I tell him off...</i>

29:51.380 --> 29:56.484
<i>...Which is coming up next.</i>

29:56.518 --> 29:59.987
So, that's how it went
for that so-called whore

30:00.022 --> 30:04.258
last time
your fiancÃ© had a relapse.

30:04.293 --> 30:05.593
That's how she felt.

30:07.095 --> 30:10.564
You see Marc's jacket,
there on the bed behind her?

30:13.268 --> 30:14.735
I'm sorry for this woman.

30:16.438 --> 30:18.339
And I know
how it must seem to you,

30:18.373 --> 30:23.077
like Marc and she got
into some kind of fight, but...

30:28.617 --> 30:30.117
It's not how it looks.

30:37.993 --> 30:41.095
Whoa. Slow down there, miss.
I'll walk you out.

30:44.399 --> 30:46.434
You think
she's telling the truth?

30:46.468 --> 30:48.302
I don't know,
but she's right about one thing.

30:48.337 --> 30:49.870
Buzz...

30:51.473 --> 30:53.507
It's not how it looks.

31:10.896 --> 31:12.230
<i>Anybody back there?</i>

31:12.264 --> 31:13.464
<i>Yeah, I am.</i>

31:15.267 --> 31:17.001
<i>Could you get me unplugged?</i>

31:17.035 --> 31:18.202
<i>Sure.</i>

31:50.569 --> 31:52.770
Hello, Lieutenant Tao?
I was --

31:53.906 --> 31:57.174
fine. Thank you.
I was looking at the --

31:57.209 --> 32:01.112
yes, it is very exciting.
The interview.

32:01.146 --> 32:02.680
But I was --

32:02.714 --> 32:03.748
Lieutenant!

32:03.782 --> 32:05.850
I have a problem.

32:05.884 --> 32:08.619
Marc Torres said
that the victim keyed his car,

32:08.654 --> 32:09.954
but she couldn't have.

32:09.988 --> 32:11.889
While he was in the shower,

32:11.924 --> 32:15.226
Judy made a very emotional entry
to her online diary.

32:15.260 --> 32:19.397
So, my question is,
"who scratched the Camaro?"

32:19.431 --> 32:21.732
Here's what I need you to do.
Okay?

32:26.471 --> 32:29.407
Now, Judy's vlog
again, Buzz.

32:35.247 --> 32:36.714
Chief...

32:36.748 --> 32:39.684
You look great.

32:39.718 --> 32:42.053
Well, thank you, Captain.

32:42.087 --> 32:43.788
I've made a reservation for us
down the --

32:43.822 --> 32:45.856
oh, I don't have time
for breakfast, actually.

32:45.891 --> 32:48.159
Why?

32:48.193 --> 32:49.560
What are you doing?

32:49.594 --> 32:51.862
Trying to find out
the exact time

32:51.897 --> 32:53.364
Marc Torres' car was keyed.

32:56.902 --> 32:59.236
Okay, you're going
backwards...

32:59.271 --> 33:00.671
Backwards...
Wait.

33:00.706 --> 33:02.406
Hold it.

33:02.441 --> 33:04.208
There it is.

33:04.242 --> 33:05.509
See? No scratch.

33:05.544 --> 33:06.610
And then...

33:09.281 --> 33:11.215
Scratch.

33:11.249 --> 33:12.550
We don't see who did it.

33:12.584 --> 33:13.684
No, Chief.

33:13.719 --> 33:15.252
What does that mean?

33:15.287 --> 33:17.688
It means I've been spending
a lot of the morning

33:17.723 --> 33:19.390
looking for things
I can't see.

33:19.424 --> 33:21.692
That scratch happened
at 9:45 P.M.,

33:21.727 --> 33:22.927
when Judy was on her date.

33:22.961 --> 33:26.163
Would you bring Marc Torres
up from holding, please?

33:26.198 --> 33:27.598
I may need him.

33:27.632 --> 33:30.434
And, um, your bag of tricks,
too. Thank you.

33:30.469 --> 33:31.435
Chief,
surely this can it.

33:31.470 --> 33:33.237
I won't miss my appointment,
Captain!

33:33.271 --> 33:34.305
I promise.

33:34.339 --> 33:36.407
I promise,
I promise, I promise.

33:50.155 --> 33:52.890
Gifford, I want to thank you
so much for letting us in.

33:52.924 --> 33:54.458
We shouldn't be
but a minute.

33:54.493 --> 33:55.626
You're making
a big mistake.

33:55.660 --> 33:56.761
Hey, you don't talk

33:56.795 --> 33:58.195
unless you're revoking
your right to an attorney.

33:59.064 --> 34:00.765
Oh, uh, Gifford,
since you helped

34:00.799 --> 34:02.900
the cable company get
everything installed,

34:02.934 --> 34:04.101
do you think you could help us
put it back the way we found it?

34:04.136 --> 34:05.169
Sure.
Thanks.

34:07.572 --> 34:10.474
You ready to talk yet,
Mr. Torres?

34:10.509 --> 34:11.609
No?
Mind the blood.

34:13.578 --> 34:18.248
So, I think the computer
was set right here.

34:19.284 --> 34:22.719
Do you remember where the
lubricant came from, Mr. Torres?

34:22.754 --> 34:25.589
Don't answer that, sir.
Your lawyer would be very upset.

34:25.623 --> 34:27.224
Don't worry.
I'm not talking.

34:27.259 --> 34:29.460
Well, you know what?
You don't have to talk,
but you do have to watch.

34:29.494 --> 34:31.695
Uh, Gifford, do you mind
pulling these through,

34:31.730 --> 34:33.063
plugging it in
on the other side?

34:33.098 --> 34:35.366
Sure.
Thanks.

34:41.505 --> 34:43.674
What the hell
are you doing, Lady?

34:43.708 --> 34:46.310
Just admiring how well
you set up that closet for Judy.

34:46.344 --> 34:49.380
She had trouble getting
her modem and her router

34:49.414 --> 34:51.382
and her phone to work
from the other room.

34:51.416 --> 34:53.016
I wonder why,
because we checked,

34:53.051 --> 34:55.252
and no one else in the building
had any trouble at all.

34:55.286 --> 34:58.522
Anyway, somehow,
you helped the cable company

34:58.557 --> 35:01.225
get it all hooked up for her
in here.

35:01.259 --> 35:04.095
'Cause you watched out for her,
didn't you, Gifford?

35:04.129 --> 35:07.731
A-and that's why you drilled
this hole in the wall?

35:07.766 --> 35:09.500
For all the cables
to go through?

35:09.534 --> 35:11.335
That's a big hole,
Gifford.

35:11.369 --> 35:13.537
Y-you can sit on that stool

35:13.572 --> 35:15.573
and look into Judy's room
without being seen

35:15.607 --> 35:17.374
and watch over her
for hours.

35:17.409 --> 35:19.243
I never did that.
Really?

35:19.277 --> 35:20.444
You know, I wonder

35:20.479 --> 35:22.413
if the DNA evidence
on the bottom of that closet

35:22.447 --> 35:24.381
will back you up on that?

35:24.416 --> 35:27.084
Sure you cleaned up
after yourself, Gifford?

35:27.119 --> 35:30.321
You know what else
can't be seen

35:30.355 --> 35:32.623
on her vlog entries?

35:32.657 --> 35:34.925
The pillow used
to smother Judy to death.

35:34.960 --> 35:37.628
That's because
it came from this closet.

35:37.662 --> 35:39.196
That's why we never saw it
in her bedroom

35:39.231 --> 35:40.364
on any of her vlogs.

35:40.398 --> 35:43.100
Just like we couldn't see
who keyed her date's car

35:43.135 --> 35:46.203
because you knew how to avoid
the security camera out front.

35:46.238 --> 35:47.705
I never scratched
that car.

35:47.739 --> 35:50.474
You want to see the gold paint
on this key

35:50.509 --> 35:53.844
you so kindly left
in the front door for us?

35:55.313 --> 35:57.815
Now, that we can see.
Now, listen to me, Gifford.

35:57.849 --> 36:01.819
I have a feeling that what happened
in that hallway was just a terrible accident.

36:01.853 --> 36:05.456
But if I'm right about that,
I-I need to hear it from you.

36:05.490 --> 36:07.057
Look...

36:08.426 --> 36:10.361
I liked her.

36:10.395 --> 36:11.829
I liked her a lot.

36:11.863 --> 36:16.000
And I only wanted
to look at --

36:16.034 --> 36:17.968
w-watch over her,
like you said.

36:18.003 --> 36:19.603
And that's what you were doing
the other night

36:19.638 --> 36:21.438
when she came home
from her date.

36:21.473 --> 36:23.207
You were
just watching over her.

36:23.241 --> 36:24.475
Mainly.

36:24.509 --> 36:26.277
Yeah.

36:26.311 --> 36:28.479
And normally, she takes a shower
before going to bed.

36:28.513 --> 36:29.747
And that's when I go.

36:29.781 --> 36:33.250
But she was upset
after that asshole left.

36:33.285 --> 36:37.188
She just laid down on the bed
for a long time.

36:37.222 --> 36:39.356
I thought she was asleep.

36:39.391 --> 36:43.894
When I tried to get out...

36:43.929 --> 36:46.697
She heard me.

36:46.731 --> 36:49.733
I got back in the closet,
but it was too late.

36:49.768 --> 36:51.869
She opened the door,
and --

36:51.903 --> 36:54.205
a-and you held up
this pillow,

36:54.239 --> 36:55.873
because she was hitting you,
right?

36:55.907 --> 36:57.875
I mean, you were just probably
trying to get out this door.

36:57.909 --> 36:59.510
But she wouldn't let me go.
Right!

37:05.617 --> 37:07.618
I didn't even know
I could push anyone that hard.

37:09.955 --> 37:11.522
It happened so fast.

37:15.660 --> 37:18.195
You were just trying
to protect yourself.

37:18.230 --> 37:20.598
A-and you tried to help her,
didn't you, after she fell?

37:22.834 --> 37:24.101
Show me.

37:25.637 --> 37:27.371
Well...

37:27.405 --> 37:28.739
She was knocked out
for a second,

37:28.773 --> 37:31.575
so I...

37:31.610 --> 37:34.745
I put the pillow under her head
to stop the bleeding,

37:34.779 --> 37:36.013
and then I...

37:36.047 --> 37:38.549
I carried her
to the bed.

37:40.518 --> 37:42.886
But then she started
the screaming all over again.

37:42.921 --> 37:45.189
So you were just trying
to muffle the noise

37:45.223 --> 37:46.590
so she didn't wake
the whole building.

37:46.625 --> 37:49.460
I couldn't think
of anything else to do.

37:49.494 --> 37:51.128
She was so loud.

37:53.798 --> 37:55.499
I think...

37:55.533 --> 37:56.834
I think you've done
a very good job

37:56.868 --> 37:58.235
explaining all this,
Gifford.

38:03.475 --> 38:06.143
So, Gifford...

38:06.177 --> 38:10.648
I'll tell you what we need
to finish our report.

38:10.682 --> 38:13.017
I'm going to tell you
your rights.

38:13.051 --> 38:15.552
And then you're going to
write down exactly,

38:15.587 --> 38:18.255
everything you said
about this accident.

38:18.290 --> 38:20.691
And then we'll be done.
Okay?

38:20.725 --> 38:22.393
Okay.

38:25.764 --> 38:27.731
Okay.

38:28.967 --> 38:31.735
So what the hell
did you bring me for?

38:31.770 --> 38:33.237
Uh...

38:35.340 --> 38:37.207
Oh, well, you know,
there wouldn't have been

38:37.242 --> 38:38.709
any paint left
on Gifford's keys,

38:38.743 --> 38:40.110
so we had to scratch
your car again.

38:40.145 --> 38:42.146
What?
Sorry about that.

38:42.180 --> 38:45.049
Oh, and, uh, I needed a witness
to the confession.

38:45.083 --> 38:47.885
Gosh, I wonder
if your testimony at the trial

38:47.919 --> 38:49.119
is gonna affect
your wedding plans.

38:49.154 --> 38:50.187
I'll tell you what.

38:50.221 --> 38:51.855
You spring
for the paint job,

38:51.890 --> 38:54.325
and I'll get the FBI
to drop the charges, okay?

39:21.577 --> 39:23.744
I was tempted
to bring a uniform escort

39:23.779 --> 39:25.513
to take you
across the street.

39:25.547 --> 39:28.449
Oh, that's not necessary.

39:28.483 --> 39:29.884
May I ask you a question?

39:29.918 --> 39:32.386
Sure, Captain. Why not?

39:33.755 --> 39:36.991
Do you really not want to be
Chief of Police?

39:37.025 --> 39:38.826
No, I don't.

39:38.860 --> 39:40.127
And as a woman,

39:40.162 --> 39:43.397
don't you feel an obligation
to at least give it a try?

39:43.432 --> 39:46.100
As a woman, I feel I've earned
the right to options,

39:46.134 --> 39:48.336
and one of my options
should be to say no.

39:48.370 --> 39:51.872
You don't think that I wanted
to spend my career

39:51.907 --> 39:53.474
in Internal Affairs,

39:53.508 --> 39:56.010
doing a job that leaves me
disliked and mistrusted

39:56.044 --> 39:57.878
by my fellow officers
every day of my life?

39:57.913 --> 39:59.947
No, I chose I.A.
because I thought it was

39:59.982 --> 40:01.682
the quickest way
to achieve rank.

40:01.717 --> 40:04.785
And I also thought it'd be good
for the department

40:04.820 --> 40:06.988
to see a woman
in a Captain's uniform.

40:07.022 --> 40:10.858
And, of course, you got
your job the old-fashioned way.

40:10.892 --> 40:12.860
How's that?

40:12.894 --> 40:14.395
By sleeping with the boss.

40:16.198 --> 40:17.531
That's not an insult.

40:17.566 --> 40:20.201
It is a time-honored way
of moving forward.

40:20.235 --> 40:22.903
But those roads are not open
to everyone,

40:22.938 --> 40:26.474
and you have the chance to maybe
change that a little.

40:26.508 --> 40:28.275
So, you're saying
I should take the job

40:28.310 --> 40:29.377
whether I want it or not.

40:29.411 --> 40:30.711
Yes.

40:30.746 --> 40:34.682
Please make
the oh-so-terrible sacrifice

40:34.716 --> 40:36.183
of accepting a promotion

40:36.218 --> 40:39.086
that offers you more money,
prestige, and power

40:39.121 --> 40:41.188
than any other job
in the city.

40:41.223 --> 40:43.858
And if it will help you
with the suffering,

40:43.892 --> 40:46.527
you'll not only be
a positive role model

40:46.561 --> 40:49.163
for little girls
all over this country,

40:49.197 --> 40:53.100
but I personally
will feel very...

40:56.271 --> 40:58.873
I will feel very proud

40:58.907 --> 41:02.710
to have a Chief
that I can truly admire.

41:06.114 --> 41:08.282
Well, thank you, Captain.

41:12.921 --> 41:14.822
It's my pleasure, Chief.

41:31.640 --> 41:33.140
See ya.
