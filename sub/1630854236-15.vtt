00:13.758 --> 00:14.965
<i>Previously on Walker...</i>

00:15.068 --> 00:16.551
Tessa Graves, FBI,

00:16.655 --> 00:18.862
San Antonio office. Pleasure.

00:18.965 --> 00:20.724
Coop, you faked your own death?

00:20.827 --> 00:23.137
What, now all my credibility
goes out the window?

00:23.241 --> 00:25.413
It's a lot to take in.

00:25.517 --> 00:26.482
I know.

00:26.586 --> 00:28.310
Happy you chose the right side.

00:28.413 --> 00:30.379
Likewise.

00:30.482 --> 00:31.931
What is the mission, exactly?

00:32.034 --> 00:33.034
You'll hear soon enough.

00:33.137 --> 00:34.275
And when you do...

00:37.448 --> 00:38.482
<i>Kevin knows everything.</i>

00:38.586 --> 00:39.655
He knows
that Trey was undercover.

00:39.758 --> 00:40.896
Oh, God.
Julia!

00:41.000 --> 00:42.310
Get down!

00:57.206 --> 00:59.448
How many are among the dead?

00:59.551 --> 01:00.862
How long has this group
operated?

01:00.965 --> 01:02.586
Is the mayor among the deceased?

01:02.689 --> 01:04.000
What else do you know
about this group?

01:04.103 --> 01:05.068
Who was the target
of the attack?

01:05.172 --> 01:06.931
Is there a suspect in custody?

01:07.034 --> 01:08.793
Listen, listen,
I can answer your questions

01:08.896 --> 01:11.137
or y'all can keep shouting
at me, but we can't do both.

01:12.931 --> 01:14.655
Thank you.

01:14.758 --> 01:17.517
Uh... good morning.

01:18.344 --> 01:20.965
At approximately
3:45 p.m. yesterday,

01:21.068 --> 01:25.034
a detonated explosive took
the lives of six FBI agents

01:25.137 --> 01:28.068
and civilian reporter
Julia Johnson.

01:28.172 --> 01:31.034
Mayor Newburg was also present.

01:31.137 --> 01:33.068
He remains
in critical condition.

01:33.172 --> 01:35.068
We can confirm
that the mayor was

01:35.172 --> 01:36.689
the intended target
of the attack,

01:36.793 --> 01:39.655
and that the bombing
was committed

01:39.758 --> 01:41.724
by an organization
called Grey Flag.

02:29.310 --> 02:31.655
I'm sorry to see you all
again like this.

02:31.758 --> 02:33.620
- Agent Graves,
what is this all this, um...
- We're going

02:33.724 --> 02:35.482
to try to get through this
as smoothly as possible.

02:35.586 --> 02:38.551
Just understand
we have jobs to do here.

02:38.655 --> 02:40.241
Start with the ranch house,

02:40.344 --> 02:41.620
move to the farmhouse.
Sweep for firearms.

02:41.724 --> 02:43.482
Aw, this is bull!

02:43.586 --> 02:46.241
Now, this isn't
exactly Rodeo Kings, okay?

02:46.344 --> 02:48.310
My brother was
captured and tortured.

02:48.413 --> 02:49.862
- I was tortured.
- Yes, I know.

02:49.965 --> 02:52.103
You were right there
right alongside Ranger Walker.

02:52.206 --> 02:55.379
Which means I have questions
for you too, Counselor.

02:57.862 --> 02:59.482
<i>The FBI has reason to believe</i>

02:59.586 --> 03:02.344
that Mr. Golden's accomplice
in yesterday's attack

03:02.448 --> 03:05.517
was Texas Ranger Cordell Walker.

03:05.620 --> 03:08.275
Deputies responded
to the report of a man

03:08.379 --> 03:09.655
matching the description
of Mr. Walker

03:09.758 --> 03:11.241
fleeing the scene
of the bombing.

03:26.413 --> 03:29.482

03:29.586 --> 03:32.793
Both should be considered
armed, dangerous

03:32.896 --> 03:35.862
and fugitives at large.
No further questions.

03:35.965 --> 03:38.551
How did Golden infiltrate
the mayor's office?

03:38.655 --> 03:39.862
Captain, do you have any idea

03:39.965 --> 03:41.862
of the whereabouts
of Ranger Walker?

04:13.413 --> 04:15.655
Give my best to Eloise.

04:22.862 --> 04:24.931
Sir, could you stop there
a minute?

04:26.275 --> 04:27.896
You okay?

04:28.000 --> 04:29.689
Yeah.

04:30.517 --> 04:31.896
On your shirt.

04:32.000 --> 04:33.448
Looks like blood.

04:35.275 --> 04:36.827
And those scratches
on your face--

04:36.931 --> 04:38.103
what happened?

04:38.206 --> 04:39.965
Yeah, the-the...

04:40.068 --> 04:41.655
Accident at the ranch.

04:41.758 --> 04:43.896
My granddad used to call that
a bad omen

04:44.000 --> 04:45.413
for a worse day.

04:45.517 --> 04:47.758
You don't know the half of it.

04:57.827 --> 04:59.241
I need a coffee.

05:04.275 --> 05:07.724

05:30.896 --> 05:32.965
It's an exact match, Captain.
The C4 found at Walker's house

05:33.068 --> 05:35.103
is the same Grey Flag used
at the Safe House.

05:35.206 --> 05:37.448
That's not in dispute,
but Walker keeping an explosive

05:37.551 --> 05:39.172
- ten feet from his kid...
- Is reckless.

05:39.275 --> 05:40.965
- It's illogical.
- Look,

05:41.068 --> 05:43.448
I honestly want you to show me
the dot I'm missing here.

05:43.551 --> 05:45.551
I want to be able
to see what you see.

05:45.655 --> 05:47.655
But right now,
it looks like a straight line

05:47.758 --> 05:49.517
to Walker taking lives
and fleeing.

05:49.620 --> 05:51.241
Innocent people don't run.

05:51.344 --> 05:52.689
They do when they've been framed

05:52.793 --> 05:54.413
and they see a circus
like this coming at 'em.

05:54.517 --> 05:56.034
Now again with this
frame job theory.

05:56.137 --> 05:58.620
Look, look, we all read
Johnson's article, great.

05:58.724 --> 06:00.000
Appreciate the editors
handing it over.

06:00.103 --> 06:02.344
But you can't deny
that it's damning.

06:02.448 --> 06:04.793
Your Ranger was psychologically
tormented by this group.

06:05.965 --> 06:08.000
He turned. I know
you don't want to hear this,

06:08.103 --> 06:09.793
but it's understandable

06:09.896 --> 06:12.344
- and unforgivable.
- Okay,

06:12.448 --> 06:14.586
who exactly
were Julia's sources?

06:15.551 --> 06:16.896
'Cause it obviously
wasn't Walker,

06:17.000 --> 06:19.758
and I'd be willing to bet
that it was Kevin Golden.

06:20.482 --> 06:22.103
Captain...

06:22.206 --> 06:24.482
I can't imagine
what you're going through.

06:24.586 --> 06:27.793
Our suspect's not just one of
your own, he's your old partner.

06:27.896 --> 06:29.931
But there's a time
for objectivity and it's now.

06:30.034 --> 06:32.275
- The man was...
- We are dealing with

06:32.379 --> 06:34.413
the man who ran
with the Rodeo Kings way longer

06:34.517 --> 06:36.068
than he should have.

06:36.172 --> 06:38.137
And you and I both know
that never sat right.

06:38.241 --> 06:41.241
You need to start wrapping your
head around where this goes.

06:41.344 --> 06:44.000
I did your
press conference, right?

06:44.103 --> 06:45.793
If he's guilty,

06:45.896 --> 06:47.896
I'll put the cuffs
on him myself.

06:49.172 --> 06:51.379
How about that?

06:53.206 --> 06:54.689
I don't know where to start.

06:54.793 --> 06:55.965
Maybe with the part
where you ran.

06:56.068 --> 06:57.724
Where a bomb went off
and you ran.

06:57.827 --> 06:59.344
Ok, Cassie, you weren't there.

06:59.448 --> 07:02.068
I-I was listening
to everything Jul...

07:03.586 --> 07:05.241
She was...

07:05.344 --> 07:06.724
explaining this article, right?

07:06.827 --> 07:08.758
How Kevin had fed her
all of this information.

07:08.862 --> 07:10.551
That I turned. That I was
working with Grey Flag.

07:10.655 --> 07:12.793
That I'd helped them find
and kill Tommy.

07:12.896 --> 07:15.793
And then it happens, you know?

07:15.896 --> 07:18.068
And she's just... she's gone.

07:18.172 --> 07:20.344
I'm talking to her and then,
in an instant,

07:20.448 --> 07:22.620
she's gone, so I went to

07:22.724 --> 07:24.275
my truck to radio for back up,

07:24.379 --> 07:26.724
and hear my name on an APB.

07:26.827 --> 07:28.068
Me.

07:28.172 --> 07:30.448
So, now she's dead.

07:30.551 --> 07:33.620
And if I'm in handcuffs,
what-what good am I to anybody?

07:40.551 --> 07:41.931
Cass...

07:42.034 --> 07:44.103
I asked her to meet me there.

07:44.206 --> 07:45.758
Where she was murdered.

07:45.862 --> 07:49.206
How-How's that
gonna look, right?

07:50.379 --> 07:51.965
"Corrupted Ranger

07:52.068 --> 07:54.724
kills journalist about
to blow the whistle on him."

07:54.827 --> 07:56.793
Among other things, yes.

07:56.896 --> 07:59.413
I just can't believe
how-how Kevin checkmated us.

07:59.517 --> 08:02.034
- How... Checkmated me.
- Or why.

08:02.137 --> 08:04.000
He infiltrated your life,
my life,

08:04.103 --> 08:05.827
all seemingly...

08:05.931 --> 08:09.379
- For this moment to happen.
- Yeah. Damn.

08:09.482 --> 08:11.517
What'd you do to him?

08:13.689 --> 08:15.275
I really wish I knew.

08:18.586 --> 08:19.965
All right,
what's your next move?

08:20.068 --> 08:21.793
I got to find Kevin,
bring him in.

08:21.896 --> 08:25.310
And hope like hell
his testimony clears me.

08:25.413 --> 08:27.172
So, I'm fine.

08:27.275 --> 08:28.862
You're not fine.

08:28.965 --> 08:30.931
Your proximity
to an explosion like that?

08:31.034 --> 08:32.965
I'm pretty sure
you have a concussion.

08:33.068 --> 08:36.344
You need medical attention.
And rest.

08:36.448 --> 08:37.896
I think I might know a place.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.655
Good.
Now come on.

08:39.758 --> 08:42.000
We need a way to keep in touch.

08:43.310 --> 08:44.793

08:48.517 --> 08:52.655

08:54.551 --> 08:56.793
Yeah, perfect.

08:59.586 --> 09:01.482
Okay.

09:01.586 --> 09:03.413

09:03.517 --> 09:05.172

- That notebook,
that stupid notebook,

10:45.206 --> 10:46.896
- that's on me.
- It was coded, the notebook...

10:47.000 --> 10:48.896

11:55.000 --> 11:57.862
All right? The feds...

11:59.793 --> 12:02.896
All they care about is Walker.

12:03.000 --> 12:04.275
You know,
it is not my fault that he

12:04.379 --> 12:06.034
doesn't know how a pen works,
'cause if he did

12:06.137 --> 12:07.931
I could tell him exactly
where he could shove it.

12:08.034 --> 12:09.310
What the hell's going on? Liam.

12:10.689 --> 12:12.310
The hell's going on?

12:12.413 --> 12:14.034
Ask Agent Graves.

12:14.137 --> 12:16.241
Because all I'm hearing
are questions about Cordi,

12:16.344 --> 12:19.379
- and I am telling you...
- I made clear we'd look into it.

12:19.482 --> 12:21.379
Yeah, but, see, it's said
dismissively. I am telling you

12:21.482 --> 12:24.000
that it is Kevin.
The guy glad-hands

12:24.103 --> 12:25.827
jet-setting donors
and he's at our ranch

12:25.931 --> 12:28.896
talking about his throttle hand.

12:29.000 --> 12:32.103
Kevin Golden is a flight risk.

12:32.206 --> 12:33.827
Kind of feels relevant.

12:33.931 --> 12:35.862
Okay, if Agent Graves
said she'd look into it,

12:35.965 --> 12:37.793
and she will.

12:37.896 --> 12:39.758
Right? We will.

12:39.862 --> 12:41.482
Well, that's mighty reassuring.

12:41.586 --> 12:43.034
- Abby.
- Larry.

12:43.137 --> 12:44.827
What is this fascination
with my son?

12:44.931 --> 12:46.689
Uh, the Bureau gets called in,

12:46.793 --> 12:48.275
- and that tends
to happen to suspects.
- You do remember the part

12:48.379 --> 12:50.068
where these folks
kidnapped my boys, right?

12:50.172 --> 12:52.103
- Got it. Wh...
- Okay, can-can I handle this?

12:52.206 --> 12:53.793
Please?

12:53.896 --> 12:55.931
I need y'all to listen to me.

12:56.034 --> 12:57.793
Last time, you guys
were the victims,

12:57.896 --> 12:58.931
this time
you are a coin flip away

12:59.034 --> 13:00.793
from being suspects.

13:01.655 --> 13:03.482
Go home, hang tight.

13:03.586 --> 13:06.517
If Cordell makes contact, you
tell him to call me immediately.

13:06.620 --> 13:07.896
We need to talk about this.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.448
We can't, Abby!

13:09.551 --> 13:10.655
Do you get that?

13:10.758 --> 13:12.275
Go home.

13:49.965 --> 13:53.482
I knew it'd be a matter of time
before you showed up here.

13:56.275 --> 13:57.724
Just...

13:57.827 --> 13:59.379
didn't picture it like this.

14:02.689 --> 14:04.620
Geri.

14:04.724 --> 14:06.379
Hi.

14:06.482 --> 14:07.655
Hey.

14:07.758 --> 14:09.827
Hey, hey, hey.

14:09.931 --> 14:12.172
I'm-I'm sorry to be here.

14:12.275 --> 14:14.448
I'm so sorry to put you
in this position.

14:14.551 --> 14:15.758
But I need you...

14:15.862 --> 14:17.689
to get in contact
with my family somehow.

14:17.793 --> 14:19.689
I am sure their phones
are tapped at this point,

14:19.793 --> 14:22.000
so you can't make it obvious,
but I need you

14:22.103 --> 14:23.827
to let them know that I'm okay.

14:23.931 --> 14:25.241
I'm alive.

14:25.344 --> 14:27.206
But?
What-what are you saying?

14:27.310 --> 14:28.413
Look...

14:28.517 --> 14:30.758
But I-I won't be home
for a while.

14:30.862 --> 14:32.689
Okay, Cordi, just come inside.

14:32.793 --> 14:34.103
Okay?
Get some rest.

14:34.206 --> 14:35.241
You don't look good.

14:35.344 --> 14:37.000
You can't harbor a fugitive.

14:37.103 --> 14:38.517
Well, it wouldn't be my first.

14:38.620 --> 14:40.344
Figure it won't be my last.
Come on.

14:40.448 --> 14:42.896
I-I wouldn't even
be here if it-if...

14:44.103 --> 14:46.413
Stella and Augie.

14:47.344 --> 14:49.965
- I can't let them think
that I'm dead.
- Okay.

14:50.068 --> 14:52.000
- Okay. Okay.
- Okay, I will tell them.

14:52.103 --> 14:53.206
- Okay? I can't.
- Come inside.

14:53.310 --> 14:54.379
- I know, I have to go.
- Cordi,

14:54.482 --> 14:55.655
- just come inside.
- Ger, Ger,

14:55.758 --> 14:56.896
I have to keep moving, okay?

14:57.000 --> 14:58.896
- I have to go.
- Cordi.

14:59.000 --> 15:00.620
'Cause if I don't... I don...

15:02.034 --> 15:04.448
Cordi! Oh, my God.

15:04.551 --> 15:06.517
Cordi.

15:06.620 --> 15:08.931
Cordi. Cordi!

15:15.793 --> 15:18.068
Shh, shh. It's okay.
You're okay, hey, hey. Hi.

15:19.482 --> 15:21.344
Hey.

15:21.448 --> 15:22.896
Uh...

15:23.000 --> 15:24.827
how long were you

15:24.931 --> 15:27.137
planning on hiding out here?

15:27.241 --> 15:29.310
I wouldn't call it hiding out.

15:29.413 --> 15:31.379
I also don't really think
that today is...

15:31.482 --> 15:34.172
Today is the day to explain
this m-mysterious

15:34.275 --> 15:36.793
"Broussard family drama?"

15:36.896 --> 15:38.965
- Mm, I said that, didn't I?
- Yeah, you did.

15:39.068 --> 15:41.724
Yes, and I caught you.
Still got it.

15:41.827 --> 15:43.793
Cordi.

15:43.896 --> 15:46.172
Are you sure-- running?

15:46.275 --> 15:48.689
That's the only way
to clear your name?

15:48.793 --> 15:52.068
Geri, it's...
it's what's best for everyone.

15:52.172 --> 15:54.586
What's that supposed to mean?

15:55.448 --> 15:58.344
A violent man needs to be
brought to justice, that's all.

15:59.172 --> 16:00.551
Okay, cowboy.

16:00.655 --> 16:02.241
That's a dodge.

16:02.344 --> 16:04.344
What'd you actually mean?

16:05.551 --> 16:08.413
We, uh, we never really talked

16:08.517 --> 16:11.275
about Afghanistan
after I came home.

16:12.965 --> 16:15.275
There was this guy, Clay Cooper.

16:15.379 --> 16:18.172
Um, real edge of the coin.

16:18.275 --> 16:20.275
You know? Uh, a guy

16:20.379 --> 16:23.137
22-year-old Cordell
looked at and thought,

16:23.241 --> 16:25.000
"That's the person
I want to be."

16:25.103 --> 16:26.448
An honest man.

16:26.551 --> 16:28.482
Or so I thought.

16:28.586 --> 16:31.068
I thought Coop died over there.

16:31.172 --> 16:33.000
We-we all did.

16:33.103 --> 16:35.000
Um...

16:35.103 --> 16:38.206
A few days ago, he... found me.

16:38.310 --> 16:40.413
A dead man found you.

16:40.517 --> 16:43.620
Yeah, so he had deserted us.

16:44.793 --> 16:47.241
But, uh, Coop

16:47.344 --> 16:49.896
told me the reason
he faked his own death

16:50.000 --> 16:51.931
was because

16:52.034 --> 16:54.172
he thought his family would

16:54.275 --> 16:56.310
be better off without him.

16:56.413 --> 16:57.965
Mm, geez.

16:58.068 --> 16:59.827
That's heartbreaking.

16:59.931 --> 17:02.413
Yeah.

17:04.655 --> 17:06.931
You know, maybe Coop and I...

17:07.034 --> 17:08.689
aren't so different.

17:08.793 --> 17:11.068
And that's foolish.

17:11.172 --> 17:12.655
Geri...

17:12.758 --> 17:14.206
you-you've been gone,

17:14.310 --> 17:16.379
so you haven't seen it.

17:16.482 --> 17:18.655
But since I've been so

17:18.758 --> 17:20.758
preoccupied with...

17:20.862 --> 17:22.551
with all this...

17:22.655 --> 17:24.655
August found his footing again.

17:24.758 --> 17:28.172
S-Stella has a business
with Liam.

17:28.275 --> 17:31.413
Things are good
at the ranch, finally.

17:31.517 --> 17:33.413
Uh...

17:33.517 --> 17:36.931
My daddy even asked me to leave,
to move out.

17:37.034 --> 17:39.103
So, I don't know.

17:39.206 --> 17:41.931
Maybe-maybe he's looking
ahead of the curve.

17:42.034 --> 17:44.482
Mm. Which is why
you want to run.

17:44.586 --> 17:46.793
I...
Not "want to."

17:46.896 --> 17:48.896
Just...

17:49.862 --> 17:52.482
Maybe not the worst timing
to need to.

17:52.586 --> 17:56.655
Okay, I'm gonna
chalk this up to exhaustion.

17:57.689 --> 17:59.551
Because this guy--
what you're telling me--

17:59.655 --> 18:02.172
it's not the man that I know.

18:05.413 --> 18:07.827
Certainly not a man
I want to know.

You got something?

19:35.137 --> 19:36.931
Yeah, I think I might.

19:37.034 --> 19:39.862
I was going through my
notebook and I remembered

19:39.965 --> 19:41.172
Kevin said this thing about

19:41.275 --> 19:42.758
"big money,
corporate interests."

19:42.862 --> 19:46.275
It was just a throwaway,
but I wrote it down anyways.

19:46.379 --> 19:47.655
Yeah, well,
compound like that would need

19:47.758 --> 19:49.379
steady financial backing, sure.

19:49.482 --> 19:51.482
Yeah, exactly,
so I checked it out.

19:51.586 --> 19:53.620
And the money trail
is murky, but

19:53.724 --> 19:55.448
there was this one name
I heard tossed around,

19:55.551 --> 19:58.482
who's on paper, connected--
Danny Dawson.

19:58.586 --> 20:00.310
Wait, Danny Dawson.

20:00.413 --> 20:03.206
That's the billionaire,

20:03.310 --> 20:04.586
gold-standard, wind energy dude?

20:04.689 --> 20:06.827
- Fits ideologically, right?
- Yeah.

20:06.931 --> 20:08.379
Well, among
his many properties is

20:08.482 --> 20:10.137
an airstrip that's
about 100 miles south.

20:10.241 --> 20:12.448
It got me thinking--
if I'm Kevin,

20:12.551 --> 20:14.172
I've planned out
this whole frame job,

20:14.275 --> 20:16.310
my next move would be
to flee the country, right?

20:16.413 --> 20:19.137
Avoid ports of entry
and try to get somewhere

20:19.241 --> 20:21.586
- without an extradition treaty.
- Mm-hmm.

20:21.689 --> 20:23.448
So my next move would be...

20:23.551 --> 20:25.827
- Somewhere private.
- Yes.

20:25.931 --> 20:27.241
And a throttle hand.

20:27.344 --> 20:28.344
What is a throttle hand?

20:28.448 --> 20:29.551
Uh, a throttle hand.

20:29.655 --> 20:31.172
Liam mentioned it earlier.

20:31.275 --> 20:33.620
It's an aviator's term,
so how much you want to bet...

20:33.724 --> 20:35.172
This airstrip

A journalist.
A useful one.

21:52.241 --> 21:53.310
And there will be

21:53.413 --> 21:54.758
to unpack it all, but right now,

21:54.862 --> 21:56.206
I need that plane.

21:56.310 --> 21:58.448
You got obsessed with some
Ranger and you got sloppy

21:58.551 --> 22:01.620
and you used our resources
for what, revenge?

22:01.724 --> 22:03.344
What'd he even
do to you, anyway?

- Oh, it is.

22:06.517 --> 22:07.931

and get him up to speed

23:09.620 --> 23:11.137
on this airstrip.

23:11.241 --> 23:12.551
Hell yeah.

23:12.655 --> 23:14.862
Dream team rides again, huh?

23:14.965 --> 23:17.793
Well, maybe no victory lap
quite so early,

23:17.896 --> 23:19.068
but yeah, it could be good.

23:19.172 --> 23:20.896
Okay. I'm sorry,
would you like to tell me

23:21.000 --> 23:23.241
the exact amount of excited
that you'd like me to be

23:23.344 --> 23:25.758
- so I could stop screwing up?
- You're fine.

23:25.862 --> 23:27.793
Well, we're not.
That's for damn sure.

23:27.896 --> 23:28.827
We need to move.

23:28.931 --> 23:30.862
No, no, no.
Cass, Cass.

23:30.965 --> 23:33.551
We have to be on
the same page, all right?

23:33.655 --> 23:35.310
We could be walking into
a firefight right now

23:35.413 --> 23:37.000
for all we know, and you're
over here giving me

23:37.103 --> 23:39.103
the cold shoulder.
And I-I don't even know why.

23:39.206 --> 23:42.758
Fine, Trey, fine.

23:45.379 --> 23:48.793
Why couldn't you have just
listened to me about Kevin?

23:48.896 --> 23:50.137
What's that supposed to mean?

23:50.241 --> 23:51.896
From the jump I didn't like him.

23:52.000 --> 23:54.379
I just felt like
something was off.

23:55.793 --> 23:58.965
But you nudged in that
charming way that you do,

23:59.068 --> 24:00.758
and Walker said
work-life balance,

24:00.862 --> 24:03.275
and so I started to think
that it was me.

24:03.379 --> 24:07.689
You know, me just being crazy
again with my nagging feelings.

24:07.793 --> 24:10.000
And y'all kept saying,
"Oh, he's such a great guy.

24:10.103 --> 24:11.275
Why don't you
give him a chance?"

24:11.379 --> 24:13.310
So when my heart pounded

24:13.413 --> 24:14.931
a little faster around him,

24:15.034 --> 24:18.206
rather than listen to my
instincts that that was fear...

24:19.586 --> 24:21.241
...I just made myself
go with the flow,

24:21.344 --> 24:22.517
call it a crush.

24:22.620 --> 24:24.793
But I wasn't crazy.

24:25.655 --> 24:27.241
And now people are dead.

24:27.344 --> 24:30.034
Kevin played all of us, Cass,
not just you.

24:30.137 --> 24:32.103
Oh, God, you're not getting it.
It's...

24:32.206 --> 24:33.931
This all could have
been different somehow

24:34.034 --> 24:35.689
if I hadn't let you
convince me...

24:35.793 --> 24:37.275
Oh, so now that's
all on me now?

24:37.379 --> 24:40.172
No, no, of course not, but...

24:40.275 --> 24:42.931
I look at you and it just
hurts so much more.

24:43.034 --> 24:44.517
Wow.

24:44.620 --> 24:45.793
I know that doesn't
make any sense,

24:45.896 --> 24:47.413
but don't tell me
that it's not valid.

24:47.517 --> 24:49.103
Have you even stopped to think
what it's been like for me

24:49.206 --> 24:51.482
- since that C4 went off?
- Oh, I know.

24:51.586 --> 24:53.275
Oh, no, I kind of hope
you don't know.

24:53.379 --> 24:55.620
Because there is no one--
and I mean no one--

24:55.724 --> 24:57.586
who blames themselves
more than I do.

24:57.689 --> 24:59.689
I have been trying
very hard to just

24:59.793 --> 25:01.862
keep my head down and Ranger up.

25:01.965 --> 25:04.379
Because the alternative--
it takes me to a very dark place

25:04.482 --> 25:06.482
of my own making.

25:06.586 --> 25:08.034
So you know what,
maybe you could just

25:08.137 --> 25:09.931
back the hell off.

25:10.034 --> 25:13.551
And I'll work on
my listening skills.

25:40.586 --> 25:44.896
<i>Kevin, I know you don't want
to hear anything from me,</i>

25:45.000 --> 25:48.000
<i>but if you do hear this,</i>

25:48.103 --> 25:50.310
<i>please just turn
yourself in, son.</i>

25:50.413 --> 25:53.586
<i>Put an end to this.
In the wake of
these revelations,</i>

25:53.689 --> 25:55.206
<i>family and friends have...</i>

25:55.310 --> 25:56.689
Did you forget something?

25:57.655 --> 25:59.379
Hey.

25:59.482 --> 26:01.310
Is this Duke?

26:03.724 --> 26:06.413
Yeah, yeah, it helps me

26:06.517 --> 26:07.793
click into the mindset.

26:08.586 --> 26:10.068
Okay, Duke,

26:10.172 --> 26:12.689
what do you think
my outlaw name would be?

26:12.793 --> 26:14.241
You know, if I went with you.

26:14.344 --> 26:18.965
Well, you strike me as,

26:19.068 --> 26:22.344
- uh, Alejandra.
- Ooh.

26:22.448 --> 26:23.896
- Yeah.
- Ali for short.

26:24.000 --> 26:25.448
Exactly. When time is
of the essence and the feds

26:25.551 --> 26:27.413
are chasing us, you can always
start the getaway car.

26:27.517 --> 26:29.862
- You can start
your own damn car.
- Ah...

26:29.965 --> 26:31.965
'Cause I just stole the jewels.

26:32.068 --> 26:33.517
- The jewels?
- Uh-huh.

26:33.620 --> 26:35.551
So-so, jewels have
something to do with Kevin now?

26:35.655 --> 26:37.896
- Yeah. It's the plot
twist. Yeah.
- The plot twist? Okay.

26:38.000 --> 26:39.586
All right, I buy it, I buy it.

26:43.793 --> 26:47.724
Geri, why don't you
come back to Austin?

26:50.896 --> 26:53.551
Take your own advice, Cordi.

26:55.241 --> 26:56.758
Hey, get back, get back.

26:56.862 --> 26:58.517
- Shh, shh.
- No, no.

26:58.620 --> 27:01.034
Cordi. Cordi, stop!

27:01.137 --> 27:03.931
- Geri...
- Just put it down. Cordi!

27:07.000 --> 27:09.413
Gonna shoot your old man?

27:09.517 --> 27:10.827
<i>There's no</i>

27:10.931 --> 27:13.862
tails.
I only used pay phones.

27:13.965 --> 27:15.448
There's nothing you need
to worry about.

27:15.551 --> 27:17.068
It's not safe to be here, Daddy.

27:17.896 --> 27:19.965
Geri told you to come,
didn't she?

27:20.068 --> 27:22.482
I had no choice.
Especially after what Geraldine

27:22.586 --> 27:23.655
told me you were fixin' to do.

27:23.758 --> 27:25.862
Alone, mind you.

27:25.965 --> 27:27.965
Alone is the only partner
I have right now

27:28.068 --> 27:29.517
after what I put
this family through.

27:29.620 --> 27:32.034
Only way to clear my name,
make things right.

27:32.137 --> 27:34.793
This whole desperado thing,
Cordell, uh...

27:34.896 --> 27:38.206
Cordell. Cordell!

27:41.586 --> 27:43.931
Now, listen to me, I...

27:45.793 --> 27:48.724
I know I-I asked you
to move out.

27:48.827 --> 27:51.413
But I was angry, and I...

27:51.517 --> 27:54.275
That stroke just about
broke this family.

27:54.379 --> 27:56.965
It took your mama,
and I-I took it out on you,

27:57.068 --> 27:59.241
and then Abeline
took it out on me.

27:59.344 --> 28:00.448
So then there's that.

28:00.551 --> 28:03.551
But, Cordell,
you have this thing, and

28:03.655 --> 28:06.172
you get it from me.

28:06.275 --> 28:09.275
But when it's all hell's bells,
you think that you have to

28:09.379 --> 28:11.827
sacrifice yourself
to protect the family.

28:11.931 --> 28:13.206
One of these days
you're gonna see

28:13.310 --> 28:15.448
that this family doesn't
want your protection

28:15.551 --> 28:17.000
if it comes with your absence.

28:20.724 --> 28:21.931
That's Cassie.

28:23.310 --> 28:25.034
Well, let's hope
she has some good news

28:25.137 --> 28:26.103
because wherever you're going,
I'm going with you.

28:26.206 --> 28:27.965
Don't you dare try to stop me.

28:32.068 --> 28:35.103
Cass, hey.
Tell me you got something.

28:39.620 --> 28:41.758
Okay.

28:43.965 --> 28:47.931
Got it.
On our way.

28:55.000 --> 28:57.862
Yeah, three, by my count.

28:57.965 --> 28:59.206
Is Kevin with them?

28:59.310 --> 29:00.793
- Negative.
- All right. Well, we got to

29:00.896 --> 29:02.482
find Kevin before they find us.

29:02.586 --> 29:04.241
Daddy.

29:25.724 --> 29:28.931

29:42.172 --> 29:45.586

29:58.034 --> 30:00.172
Yeah.
Never a doubt in my mind.

30:02.551 --> 30:04.724
- I'm out, Daddy.
- What are you fixin' to do?

30:04.827 --> 30:06.724
I'm gonna push forward.
Cover me.

30:06.827 --> 30:08.931
All right, I got the perimeter.

30:14.206 --> 30:16.448
Kevin Golden!
Stop right there. Don't move.

30:16.551 --> 30:20.448
It's over. You have the right
to remain silent.

30:20.551 --> 30:22.931
Is that what this is?

30:23.965 --> 30:25.758
- An arrest?
- Could be.

30:25.862 --> 30:27.931
I'm not sure you want
to try out the other route.

30:28.034 --> 30:29.655
Don't get it twisted.

30:29.758 --> 30:32.172
You're a fugitive, Cordell.

30:33.000 --> 30:34.206
Just like me.

30:34.310 --> 30:36.068
Whatever authority
you had yesterday,

30:36.172 --> 30:37.482
you don't anymore.

30:37.586 --> 30:40.137
You're a wanted terrorist,
a murderer.

30:40.241 --> 30:45.206
You killed decorated soldiers,
federal agents.

30:45.310 --> 30:48.137
A journalist.
You can take your pick

30:48.241 --> 30:50.275
on the alphabet soup,
but I guarantee you

30:50.379 --> 30:52.931
there's a long line of people
willing to hunt you down.

30:53.034 --> 30:54.655
Yeah, maybe.

30:54.758 --> 30:56.379
But you won't be one of them.

30:56.482 --> 30:59.931
No, you're gonna suffer
the same fate

31:00.034 --> 31:02.068
you all gave to Clay.

31:02.172 --> 31:04.103
You think I abandoned Coop?

31:05.862 --> 31:07.103
That isn't what happened.

31:07.206 --> 31:09.172
- That is what happened.
- No, it's not.

31:09.275 --> 31:12.827
Turner, Adams Ortiz, me--

31:12.931 --> 31:16.241
we all went back
for our brother.

31:19.724 --> 31:21.517
We all went back

31:21.620 --> 31:24.068
for your brother.

31:24.172 --> 31:25.965
Yeah, you know, I've been,
uh, racking my brain

31:26.068 --> 31:28.068
these last couple days
wondering "why me?

31:28.172 --> 31:31.827
Why did you target me?"

31:31.931 --> 31:34.137
Well, I know now.

31:34.241 --> 31:36.689
It's because Clay Cooper

31:36.793 --> 31:40.344
is your brother. Right?

31:40.448 --> 31:42.689
Please just turn
yourself in, son.

31:42.793 --> 31:44.000
<i>Put an end to this.</i>

31:48.896 --> 31:50.034
He was coming home.

31:50.137 --> 31:52.034
Kevin, I can explain.

31:52.137 --> 31:54.448
He was coming home!

31:56.413 --> 31:59.275
There's nothing to explain.

31:59.379 --> 32:02.137
You didn't then
and you can't now.

32:02.241 --> 32:04.448
What do you mean, "then"?

32:04.551 --> 32:07.137
Walter Reed, 2004.

32:07.241 --> 32:10.413
You were being pinned
for your courage under fire.

32:10.517 --> 32:14.068
For getting Turner and Ortiz
and Adams to safety,

32:14.172 --> 32:16.034
but not Clay.

32:17.517 --> 32:19.586
- I remember.
- Tell me something,

32:19.689 --> 32:21.310
do you remember coming
to my family's table

32:21.413 --> 32:23.275
and giving us your condolences?

32:24.310 --> 32:25.172
No.

32:25.275 --> 32:27.137
Because you didn't.

32:42.000 --> 32:43.379
Psst.

32:59.413 --> 33:01.137
<i>I learned something that day.</i>

33:01.241 --> 33:03.931
You Marines are all part
of the same machine.

33:04.034 --> 33:06.310
You're all a bunch of liars.

33:06.413 --> 33:08.965
No apologies are gonna
bring my brother back.

33:09.068 --> 33:10.586
They don't have to.

33:18.551 --> 33:21.344
Clay.

33:21.448 --> 33:23.103
Look...

33:24.068 --> 33:25.137
Look...

33:27.034 --> 33:28.310

33:28.413 --> 33:30.241
Put the gun down, Kevin.

33:30.344 --> 33:33.172
What is this?
What's happening?

33:33.275 --> 33:35.482
Listen to your brother.
Put the gun down.

33:35.586 --> 33:37.310
We can sort all this out
once and for all.

33:37.413 --> 33:39.310
All cards up, no more lies.

33:39.413 --> 33:41.827
No, they left you for dead.

33:41.931 --> 33:43.000
He abandoned you.

33:43.103 --> 33:44.965
No, no, Kevin, this is my fault.

33:45.068 --> 33:46.620
I abandoned both of you.

33:49.172 --> 33:50.758
You said you were coming home.

33:52.241 --> 33:53.758
You said it was gonna be us,

33:53.862 --> 33:55.172
that Dad didn't have to
stay in the picture.

33:55.275 --> 33:57.517
You said you were coming home!

33:58.344 --> 34:01.482
Yeah, I know I did, buddy,
and I know I failed you.

34:02.586 --> 34:05.068
I've let you down and I'm sorry.

34:06.965 --> 34:09.517
I was not in a good place,
and I honestly thought

34:09.620 --> 34:12.758
that you'd be better off
without me, and I was wrong.

34:14.793 --> 34:17.379
What about me?
You left me with him.

34:18.172 --> 34:19.965
Did you put him up to this?

34:20.068 --> 34:21.413
Are you guys in
this together, is that
No, no, no, Kevin,

34:21.517 --> 34:22.413
- what this is?
- no, no, no, no, no.

34:22.517 --> 34:24.034
Kevin, I'm here on my own.

34:24.137 --> 34:27.827
Words cannot express
how sorry I am

34:27.931 --> 34:30.448
for everything that's happened.

34:30.551 --> 34:31.620
For all the people that suffered

34:31.724 --> 34:32.862
because of what I did

34:32.965 --> 34:35.241
and because of what
I made you do.

34:37.344 --> 34:39.241
But it's got to stop, Kevin.

34:39.344 --> 34:41.620
Time's come for us
to put an end to this

34:41.724 --> 34:43.448
and turn ourselves in.

34:45.068 --> 34:47.206
Too many people are dead.

34:47.310 --> 34:49.344
<i>♪ You can run... ♪</i>

34:51.137 --> 34:52.586

35:26.344 --> 35:27.689
It went all the way through.

35:27.793 --> 35:29.172
All right.

35:29.965 --> 35:32.000
I got him.
All right, here we go, okay?

35:32.103 --> 35:33.896
You go take care of that.
I got him.

35:34.000 --> 35:36.275
Okay.
Wait, wait, Cordi.
Come here.

35:36.379 --> 35:40.241
Go get him.
Be careful.

Always had a bad feeling
about that guy.

38:51.379 --> 38:53.862
- We appreciate it.
- Thank you.

38:56.689 --> 38:58.068
Well, what can I say?

38:58.172 --> 39:01.448
Whatever it is,
hopefully it's over a steak

39:01.551 --> 39:03.103
at the Big Texan.

39:03.206 --> 39:06.724
Seventy-two ounces
sounds fair, considering.

39:06.827 --> 39:07.965
I owe you more than a steak.

39:08.068 --> 39:09.413
Yeah, especially since

39:09.517 --> 39:11.000
you didn't get to shoot me
this time.

39:11.103 --> 39:13.413
May I?

39:13.517 --> 39:17.034
Happy to say that
we all owe you an apology.

39:17.137 --> 39:18.758
Let's just add it
to the list of things

39:18.862 --> 39:21.344
he's gonna be recognized for
at the medal ceremony.

39:21.448 --> 39:25.137
We're rescheduling that, right?

39:25.241 --> 39:26.517
Too soon?

39:26.620 --> 39:28.965
Yeah. My people will be

39:29.068 --> 39:30.379
reaching out
for an official statement,

39:30.482 --> 39:32.137
but Mr. Cooper's
confirmed your innocence

39:32.241 --> 39:34.655
and helped us connect
some dots we couldn't

39:34.758 --> 39:36.137
on Mr. Golden before now.

39:36.241 --> 39:38.689
CCTV cameras in the hangar
should do the rest.

39:38.793 --> 39:41.413
FBI also agreed to a joint
press conference tomorrow

39:41.517 --> 39:43.413
so we can
set the record straight.

39:43.517 --> 39:45.241
Yeah, maybe next time I see you

39:45.344 --> 39:47.551
we can be on
the same side of things.

39:54.517 --> 39:55.724
I'd like that.

39:58.655 --> 39:59.965
All right, man.

40:00.068 --> 40:01.931
Come on, now,
your dad's waiting.

40:02.034 --> 40:05.379
Ride out and roll out,
and the rest--

40:05.482 --> 40:07.482
- Just don't tell Mama.
- don't tell Mama.

40:09.068 --> 40:10.931
You know, maybe we should
tell your mama this time.

40:11.793 --> 40:13.137
Think I owe her a conversation.

40:13.241 --> 40:15.379
Yeah.

40:25.655 --> 40:28.413
- Hey.
- Hey.

40:29.689 --> 40:32.034
Look, I was thinking.

40:32.137 --> 40:35.379
Maybe some wings
at The Side Step are in order?

40:36.379 --> 40:38.517
That and an overdue apology?

40:39.655 --> 40:41.137
I've been thinking, too.

40:41.241 --> 40:44.827
Cass, I'm not looking
for an apology from you. Uh...

40:46.862 --> 40:48.931
I know why it hurts
so much more with you.

40:51.310 --> 40:52.931
I mean...

40:53.034 --> 40:54.413
we're both coming up.

40:54.517 --> 40:56.344

40:56.448 --> 40:59.000
Hell, we're
practically roommates.
