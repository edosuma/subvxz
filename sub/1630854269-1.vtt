just leave me alone?

12:25.810 --> 12:26.710
We've been done.

12:28.989 --> 12:30.857
So you not listening to me?

12:48.140 --> 12:49.304
[DOOR OPENS]

12:51.176 --> 12:52.307
Hey, Jerome.

12:54.179 --> 12:55.079
What's up, Rayven?

12:55.576 --> 12:56.674
[SIGHS] Nothing.

12:59.382 --> 13:01.184
I'm all right, I
couldn't sleep.

13:02.682 --> 13:03.956
You up for a walk?

13:03.991 --> 13:05.782
Let me, um,
change my clothes, all right?

13:09.326 --> 13:10.457
[DOOR OPENS]

13:17.202 --> 13:18.795
You look nice tonight.

13:18.830 --> 13:21.534
-You got a little date night
or something?
-[CHUCKLES]

13:21.569 --> 13:22.502
You can say that.

13:23.736 --> 13:25.879
Oh, wait. So,
like, the ex-boo?

13:27.377 --> 13:28.508
Somebody I grew up with.

13:31.150 --> 13:32.446
What's going on?

13:32.481 --> 13:34.085
-What's going through your
mind? -[SIGHS]

13:36.089 --> 13:38.023
Well...

13:38.058 --> 13:40.817
I really shouldn't be
telling you this 'cause
I don't know you like that,

13:41.721 --> 13:43.160
but I don't know.

13:43.195 --> 13:44.557
You seem cool.

13:44.592 --> 13:46.658
Kinda feel like
I can trust you.

13:46.693 --> 13:49.661
Trust me? Don't
I feel special.

13:49.696 --> 13:52.598
-You should,
because I'm a special girl.
-[CHUCKLES]

13:54.437 --> 13:55.535
[SIGHS]

13:56.043 --> 13:57.471
Anyway...

14:02.577 --> 14:04.445
-Jerome, I'm a stripper.
-[LAUGHS]

14:05.349 --> 14:06.953
Come on, stop playin'.

14:06.988 --> 14:08.845
No, I'm serious.

14:08.880 --> 14:10.748
-I've been dancing
for some years now.
-Wanna sit down?

14:16.965 --> 14:18.162
[SIGHS]

14:19.231 --> 14:21.429
I've been dancing
for some years now,

14:21.464 --> 14:23.970
and I'm trying
to get out of it.

14:25.699 --> 14:26.764
So what's stopping you?

14:27.635 --> 14:28.766
Bills.

14:30.374 --> 14:33.276
[SIGHS] And sad
to say, Robert.

14:35.478 --> 14:38.578
Met him when I first started
working at the strip club
a few years ago.

14:40.285 --> 14:42.318
He was a good guy
and he helped me out a lot.

14:43.948 --> 14:46.685
But then he started changing.

14:48.755 --> 14:51.998
I didn't have a place to live
and he let me stay with him.

14:52.033 --> 14:55.100
But he would literally
just take all my money.

14:56.466 --> 14:59.500
He just became really abusive

14:59.535 --> 15:01.469
and was, like, threatening me
all the time.

15:04.276 --> 15:06.804
I was dumb and I didn't really
wanna believe that that's
what he was doing,

15:06.839 --> 15:07.838
but he was.

15:12.020 --> 15:14.449
[EXHALES] I just don't know
what to do.

15:16.453 --> 15:17.683
So what you want me to do?

15:19.522 --> 15:21.753
I don't know,
you're a cop, right?

15:21.788 --> 15:23.425
Can't you arrest his ass
or something?

15:23.460 --> 15:24.855
It don't work like that.

15:25.990 --> 15:27.495
You say
he a powerful guy, right?

15:29.400 --> 15:30.795
Plus, I'm just a street cop.

15:32.469 --> 15:33.765
Yeah, and?

15:33.800 --> 15:37.538
Okay, that means he gotta
have somebody on payroll.

15:42.974 --> 15:44.347
But I can keep an ear
open for you.

15:46.450 --> 15:47.548
All right?

15:49.717 --> 15:50.881
Can I ask you a question?

15:52.159 --> 15:53.059
Yeah.

15:54.425 --> 15:56.722
Is... dancing all you do?

15:59.023 --> 16:00.561
What, you trying
to ask me if I'm a ho?

16:01.564 --> 16:02.563
I'm not.

16:04.897 --> 16:09.900
I have slept with a few guys,
here and there, but that's it.

16:12.674 --> 16:13.574
If I'm being honest...

16:14.907 --> 16:16.907
my mother was a prostitute.

16:19.087 --> 16:21.318
And all I know
is she died from it.

16:25.159 --> 16:26.059
I'm sorry to hear that.

16:27.920 --> 16:29.722
Wait. What do you mean,
from all you know?

16:33.101 --> 16:35.497
I grew up in a foster home.

16:35.532 --> 16:37.367
That's why I never really knew
what happened to my mother.

16:40.603 --> 16:42.603
That's the reason
why I became a cop.

16:45.608 --> 16:48.114
To protect women
of the streets like yourself.

16:52.120 --> 16:53.053
But I got you.

16:54.221 --> 16:55.286
You gonna be good, all right?

16:59.017 --> 17:01.226
Come on, let me treat you
to some coffee.

17:01.954 --> 17:03.327
Coffee?

17:03.362 --> 17:05.098
That's that bougie shit.
I'm gonna need a real drink.

17:05.133 --> 17:07.991
-[CLICKS TONGUE]
What you want, some Henny?
-Yeah.

17:08.026 --> 17:10.069
-Want some Patron?
-[LAUGHS] For sure.

17:34.657 --> 17:36.228
JEROME: Oh, look who it is.

17:36.263 --> 17:37.493
Hey, what's up?

17:37.528 --> 17:39.297
-What's going on, Rayven?
-You okay?

17:39.332 --> 17:41.794
-I'm good, how are you?
-Good.

17:41.829 --> 17:44.566
-How you feeling?
-I feel good.

17:44.601 --> 17:46.370
I actually thought
about you earlier.

17:46.405 --> 17:48.273
-Oh, yeah?
-Mmm-hmm.

17:48.308 --> 17:52.409
Yeah, I really wanted
to thank you for our long talk
last night.

17:52.444 --> 17:55.643
-I really, really,
really needed that.
-Hmm.

17:55.678 --> 17:57.810
So much so that...

17:57.845 --> 17:59.548
I decided to stop dancing.

17:59.583 --> 18:01.286
-Wait, what?
-Yeah.

18:01.321 --> 18:03.585
I'm gonna enroll myself
in school.

18:03.620 --> 18:05.950
That's what's up.
Where'd that come from?

18:05.985 --> 18:08.986
I don't know, I just think
it's time for a change.

18:09.021 --> 18:12.264
So I called my boss and I was
like, "Look, I'm done."

18:12.299 --> 18:15.333
And, so, tonight is actually
my last night dancing.

18:16.468 --> 18:19.733
[EXHALES] And I was...

18:19.768 --> 18:21.834
kind of hoping
that you could come.

18:21.869 --> 18:24.771
Well, first of all,
congratulations.

18:24.806 --> 18:26.674
I'm proud of you
taking different steps.

18:26.709 --> 18:27.972
That's a good thing.

18:28.007 --> 18:30.183
Thank you. I mean,
I really owe it all to you.

18:30.218 --> 18:32.009
Nah, you don't owe me, man.

18:33.320 --> 18:35.848
[CLICKS TONGUE]
So I'mma see you tonight?

18:36.686 --> 18:38.950
Oh, man. [EXHALES]

18:38.985 --> 18:42.393
I don't wanna make you
any promises, but I can see
what I can do, all right?

18:44.529 --> 18:46.463
All right, I understand.

18:46.498 --> 18:47.761
I know you're a busy man.

18:47.796 --> 18:50.731
-Got a job and all that.
-[CHUCKLES]

18:50.766 --> 18:54.031
But I do hope to
see you tonight.

18:54.066 --> 18:56.132
-Cool?
-Cool.

18:57.740 --> 18:59.872
All right, well, I'm gonna
hurry up and get out of here

18:59.907 --> 19:02.039
'cause I got a lot of stuff
to do.

19:02.074 --> 19:03.678
What you got
there, little girl?

19:03.713 --> 19:06.175
I got stuff to do,
it's my last night.

19:06.210 --> 19:07.979
-Mmm-hmm.
-You gonna miss it.

19:08.014 --> 19:09.981
Hopefully not.

19:10.016 --> 19:13.182
But you, my friend,
are gonna be safe
in these streets.

19:13.217 --> 19:15.360
-All right,
I'll see you later on.
-See you later.

19:15.395 --> 19:16.757
-Have a good night.
-You too.

19:19.696 --> 19:20.794
Damn.

19:22.270 --> 19:23.566
[SIGHS]

19:31.939 --> 19:33.312
All right, later.

-No, it is not like that.

20:15.983 --> 20:17.488
What are you doing here?

20:17.523 --> 20:19.017
You know,
I'll miss your grand finale.

20:19.052 --> 20:21.591
Least I could do was come
to give you a ride, right?

20:21.626 --> 20:23.923
-Aw, thank you.
-How was your night?

20:23.958 --> 20:26.222
It was good. It
was really good.

20:26.257 --> 20:27.960
Okay. Got a lot of money?

20:27.995 --> 20:30.435
-[PATS BAG] Money in the bag.

-I got you something.
-Really?

20:31.900 --> 20:32.932
-Yeah, hold on.
-Okay.

20:39.446 --> 20:41.237
Aw, thank you.

20:42.482 --> 20:44.779
So sweet of you.

20:44.814 --> 20:46.715
Yeah, I don't know.

20:46.750 --> 20:48.750
It's the thought
that counts, right?

20:48.785 --> 20:49.916
It's a little sign.

20:57.024 --> 20:58.254
Thank you.

20:59.598 --> 21:00.861
Very sweet.

21:02.293 --> 21:03.369
I really appreciate that.

21:03.998 --> 21:05.503
No doubt. Shall we?

21:06.132 --> 21:07.604
Sure.

21:07.639 --> 21:08.671
Wait.

21:10.136 --> 21:12.543
-I wanna take you somewhere.
-Take me where?

21:13.304 --> 21:14.545
It's a surprise.

21:14.580 --> 21:16.008
-A surprise?
-Mmm-hmm.

21:17.176 --> 21:19.044
-Are you down?
-I'm down.

21:19.079 --> 21:20.947
-All right.
-Come one.

21:20.982 --> 21:22.652
No, wait, actually,
let me drive.

21:23.490 --> 21:24.687
You ain't even got no license.

21:24.722 --> 21:26.953
I don't need a license.
You a cop, remember?

21:26.988 --> 21:29.252
[CHUCKLES]

21:29.287 --> 21:31.958
-You better not scratch my
car, all right?
-I got you.

21:36.470 --> 21:38.536
You better not,
I'm telling you.

21:38.571 --> 21:39.834
That bag gonna be mine.

21:49.648 --> 21:50.845
RAYVEN: You like?

21:51.815 --> 21:53.012
JEROME: It's beautiful.

21:54.180 --> 21:55.179
Yeah.

21:56.556 --> 21:59.359
I come here whenever I wanna
just escape the world.

22:05.026 --> 22:06.432
You're really spiritual, huh?

22:07.567 --> 22:08.467
Yeah, a little.

22:10.702 --> 22:12.999
I get it from my mother.

22:13.034 --> 22:15.573
She used to read
these spiritual books
to me before bed.

22:17.005 --> 22:19.137
Taught me so much
about the moon.

22:21.581 --> 22:22.778
So tell me about this moon.

22:25.343 --> 22:26.848
Well...

22:26.883 --> 22:30.753
That's a full moon,
which represents
our inner world.

22:32.053 --> 22:33.393
Our hidden emotions.

22:34.319 --> 22:35.626
Our desires.

22:36.354 --> 22:38.596
Our shadow self.

22:38.631 --> 22:40.895
Our fears, our worries,
and our dreams.

22:45.396 --> 22:48.034
It offers us the ability
to escape,

22:48.905 --> 22:50.366
and learn from the past,

22:51.776 --> 22:54.711
and creatively unlock
and express our essence.

22:57.177 --> 22:58.682
Wow.

22:58.717 --> 23:00.948
I didn't know the moon
had so much of a purpose.

23:02.314 --> 23:03.313
It gets deeper.

23:06.626 --> 23:08.428
I'm glad you're willing
to learn it, friend.

23:09.288 --> 23:10.254
You mentioned your mother.

23:11.598 --> 23:12.960
Where is she?

23:12.995 --> 23:14.731
She died when I was six.

23:16.460 --> 23:17.800
My aunt raised me.

23:21.575 --> 23:23.267
That sounds similar
to my story.

23:25.073 --> 23:27.139
-What about your father?
-Mmm.

23:29.308 --> 23:31.484
He's around, you know?

23:31.519 --> 23:34.410
I talk to him every now and
then whenever he wants to be
loving.

23:35.083 --> 23:36.918
But...

23:36.953 --> 23:39.954
He's not the typical
type of father that you like
to show off, you know?

23:41.485 --> 23:44.794
-Yeah.
-But we don't get to pick
our parents.

23:46.028 --> 23:47.126
[SIGHS]

23:48.998 --> 23:50.162
Word.

23:50.197 --> 23:51.328
Why do you say that?

23:52.870 --> 23:54.166
Just the stuff he doing.

23:55.235 --> 23:56.641
I don't agree with it.

23:59.811 --> 24:02.713
That's probably why
I'm fucked up now
and have daddy issues.

24:09.315 --> 24:10.721
Your hands are so filthy.

24:12.120 --> 24:13.592
You should take
better care of them.

24:17.664 --> 24:18.630
I'll try.

24:21.063 --> 24:22.194
You ready to go?

24:23.032 --> 24:24.262
I'm getting a little chilly.

24:30.171 --> 24:31.302
Not yet.

24:32.239 --> 24:33.876
I'm kind of
enjoying the moment.

24:36.210 --> 24:37.242
Get up.

-What?

25:15.953 --> 25:17.722
Nothing.

25:17.757 --> 25:19.625

turned out perfect.

25:21.959 --> 25:24.157

your jacket back.

being a gentleman.

-Nothing.
-What, you got a girl
or something?

25:43.409 --> 25:44.716
No, it's not that.

It's just, I don't wanna
move too fast.

I got a habit
of messing things up.

Trying to figure out who I am,
where I want to be at.

01:12:55.238 --> 01:12:57.007
Sometimes as a parent,

01:12:58.175 --> 01:13:00.307
you don't make
all the right decisions.

01:13:02.212 --> 01:13:04.311
That's just an excuse, Daddy.

01:13:05.721 --> 01:13:08.018
Well, that's my truth.

01:13:08.053 --> 01:13:09.382
Well, it's not good enough.

01:13:18.602 --> 01:13:19.898
Daddy, do you know...

01:13:22.331 --> 01:13:23.671
what I had to do for money?

01:13:27.072 --> 01:13:28.104
[SNIFFLES]

01:13:32.440 --> 01:13:34.407
[CRYING] I had to dance

01:13:36.246 --> 01:13:37.553
and sleep with men...

01:13:41.185 --> 01:13:43.053
thinking that they would
give me the kind of love

01:13:43.088 --> 01:13:44.560
that I should have
gotten from you.

01:13:47.532 --> 01:13:50.731
Well, you did what
you had to do, right?

01:13:51.833 --> 01:13:53.602
What?

01:13:53.637 --> 01:13:55.802
What kind of father says that
to their daughter?

01:13:55.837 --> 01:13:58.838
The kind of father
that is still healing, Rayven.

01:13:58.873 --> 01:14:00.070
I'm not perfect.

01:14:00.105 --> 01:14:02.974
I've done some messed-up
things in my life.

01:14:03.009 --> 01:14:05.713
But I didn't sit around
and pout about it.

01:14:05.748 --> 01:14:07.407
One thing about being a man,

01:14:07.442 --> 01:14:10.377
a man can never
stop being a man,

01:14:10.412 --> 01:14:13.919
and I'm man enough
to step up and say,

01:14:14.790 --> 01:14:16.955
I'm sorry. I admit my wrong.

01:14:23.964 --> 01:14:26.426
Life is not gonna
always be easy, Rayven.

01:14:29.266 --> 01:14:30.672
We have to put forth

01:14:32.137 --> 01:14:33.807
better effort to be
a better person

01:14:36.141 --> 01:14:39.241
and good results
will show from that.

01:14:42.510 --> 01:14:47.821
This is me asking you
for your forgiveness

01:14:50.727 --> 01:14:51.825
and to help me

01:14:53.323 --> 01:14:55.961
become a better
father for you.

01:15:00.638 --> 01:15:01.571
Did you kill her?

01:15:02.970 --> 01:15:04.200
Your mother? No.

01:15:05.071 --> 01:15:07.709
No. [SNIFFLES] Jerome's mom.

01:15:09.108 --> 01:15:13.616
Rayven, I have never
killed another soul.

01:15:14.949 --> 01:15:17.620
Jerome's mother
was my close friend...

01:15:20.790 --> 01:15:21.954
and still is.

01:15:25.388 --> 01:15:27.058
What do you mean
and she still is?

01:15:29.227 --> 01:15:30.226
She's not dead.

I just want to thank you
for not giving up on me.

01:17:18.501 --> 01:17:19.434
Thank you.

01:17:20.635 --> 01:17:22.074
You taught me a lot,
to be honest.

01:17:23.011 --> 01:17:26.848
Not to be afraid,
to embrace it.

01:17:31.888 --> 01:17:32.986
Why don't we get away?

01:17:34.121 --> 01:17:35.549
You know, like,
maybe go to New York

01:17:35.584 --> 01:17:37.056
since I've never been.

01:17:37.091 --> 01:17:39.520
-You're really stuck
on this New York shit.
-[LAUGHS]

01:17:39.555 --> 01:17:41.698
I am. Let's go.

01:17:43.163 --> 01:17:46.164
-I'm down for it.
-Okay. Cool.

01:17:48.333 --> 01:17:51.004
-You wanna leave tomorrow?
-All right.

01:18:03.051 --> 01:18:05.183
Baby, I've been
texting my dad.

01:18:05.218 --> 01:18:06.316
We talk.

01:18:08.155 --> 01:18:10.221
Mainly because I needed
closure for myself.

01:18:13.391 --> 01:18:14.390
That's good.

01:18:19.034 --> 01:18:21.199
I asked him to meet me here.

01:18:21.234 --> 01:18:23.971
Baby, I think
you two should talk.

01:18:24.006 --> 01:18:27.975
-Talk about what, baby?
-Your mom.

01:18:28.010 --> 01:18:31.044
Baby, to heal,
you have to be able

01:18:31.079 --> 01:18:32.672
to face those who scarred you.

01:18:33.818 --> 01:18:35.983
And even though he scarred me,

01:18:36.018 --> 01:18:37.919
he has some unknown answers

01:18:37.954 --> 01:18:39.987
that he could
probably help you with.

01:18:40.022 --> 01:18:42.121
That man
can't help me with shit.

01:18:45.225 --> 01:18:46.521
Baby, I forgave him.

01:18:48.261 --> 01:18:49.865
Can you just try it for me?

01:18:51.198 --> 01:18:52.098
Please?

01:18:55.499 --> 01:18:56.399
Please.

01:19:00.273 --> 01:19:01.107
Hey, Daddy.

01:19:06.213 --> 01:19:08.510
I'm gonna
let you two talk, okay?

01:19:08.545 --> 01:19:09.709
Baby, I'll be in the car.

01:19:22.625 --> 01:19:23.525
I'm sorry, Jerome.

01:19:25.364 --> 01:19:28.937
Us parents don't
always get it right.

01:19:30.468 --> 01:19:31.599
Some do.

01:19:31.634 --> 01:19:32.534
Some don't.

01:19:35.803 --> 01:19:37.572
Shit. If I'm
going to be honest,

01:19:38.377 --> 01:19:40.179
it has taken me some 30 years

01:19:41.446 --> 01:19:43.248
and I'm still learning
how to be a father.

01:19:47.386 --> 01:19:49.683
But one thing I do know
about your mother,

01:19:50.994 --> 01:19:52.455
she is a fighter.

01:19:52.490 --> 01:19:54.655
Come on, man.
Stop talking
about my mother, man.

01:19:57.297 --> 01:19:58.428
A fighter just like you.

01:20:02.170 --> 01:20:05.171
I'm working on
having a better
relationship with Rayven

01:20:07.274 --> 01:20:08.636
and hope that
includes you too.

01:20:11.113 --> 01:20:13.850
My baby girl, she loves you.

01:20:15.986 --> 01:20:17.678
And love is hard to come by.

01:20:20.485 --> 01:20:21.583
Take it from me.

01:20:32.563 --> 01:20:33.760
What's this, man?

01:20:34.895 --> 01:20:37.335
It's the address
where your mother is.

01:20:39.306 --> 01:20:41.504
Come on, man,
you come over here
to talk about my mother, yo?

01:20:42.276 --> 01:20:43.473
My mother's dead. All right?

01:20:48.579 --> 01:20:49.545
Your mother's not dead.

01:20:51.417 --> 01:20:52.350
Go see her.

01:21:26.749 --> 01:21:28.089
RAYVEN: You got everything?

01:21:28.124 --> 01:21:31.587
Yeah. What the hell
you got in these bags?

01:21:31.622 --> 01:21:32.654
We're going to
New York, right?

01:21:35.263 --> 01:21:36.592
Remind me to change my shoes

01:21:36.627 --> 01:21:38.231
-before I get out the car.
-All right.

01:21:40.070 --> 01:21:43.368
Jerome, I love you.

01:21:43.403 --> 01:21:44.435
Girl, get in the car.

01:21:44.470 --> 01:21:47.009
-Jerome, I love you.
-I love you, too.

01:22:05.326 --> 01:22:06.886
Which house is it?

01:22:06.921 --> 01:22:09.130
It's this one right here.

01:22:09.165 --> 01:22:10.593
You sure you don't
want me to go in with you?

01:22:11.794 --> 01:22:12.694
I'm sure.

01:22:13.268 --> 01:22:14.399
Okay.

01:22:14.434 --> 01:22:16.137
I'll be right here
when you get back.

01:22:16.172 --> 01:22:17.072
All right.

01:22:43.023 --> 01:22:44.033
SHEILA: Who at my door?

01:22:53.704 --> 01:22:55.341
Oh, my God.

01:22:55.376 --> 01:22:58.179
-Jerome, hey, baby.
-Don't touch me!

01:22:59.039 --> 01:23:00.511
Well, you wanna come in?

01:23:00.546 --> 01:23:02.414
No, I don't wanna come inside.

01:23:02.449 --> 01:23:05.648
Now, Jerome, you listen here.

01:23:05.683 --> 01:23:07.122
You need to lower your voice.

01:23:07.157 --> 01:23:08.354
No, you listen to me.

01:23:10.688 --> 01:23:12.556
How could you just
leave me like that?

01:23:14.494 --> 01:23:16.824
All these years I'm out here
searching for somebody

01:23:16.859 --> 01:23:18.826
who killed you,
and you're alive.

01:23:21.061 --> 01:23:23.501
Did you even think
about searching for me?

01:23:23.536 --> 01:23:24.568
I'm sorry.

01:23:26.572 --> 01:23:28.539
-I wasn't there.
-[INAUDIBLE]

01:23:30.510 --> 01:23:31.773
But I thought of you, though.

01:23:31.808 --> 01:23:35.084
You... [SCOFFS]
You thought of me?

01:23:38.386 --> 01:23:41.222
Why? Can you answer that? Why?

01:23:42.390 --> 01:23:45.292
I wasn't well, Jerome.

01:23:45.327 --> 01:23:49.164
I couldn't take care of you.
I couldn't take care of
myself.

01:23:49.199 --> 01:23:52.497
I wasn't good for myself,
for you, and nobody else.

01:23:53.533 --> 01:23:54.994
You gotta understand.

01:23:57.834 --> 01:23:58.668
I couldn't do it.

01:24:00.067 --> 01:24:02.606
You don't know what
I've been going through.

01:24:03.840 --> 01:24:05.037
You don't know how I feel.

01:24:07.745 --> 01:24:10.548
That is not a good enough
answer for me.

01:24:15.291 --> 01:24:16.224
Thank you, though.

01:24:18.954 --> 01:24:21.460
-Thank you for nothing.
-Jerome...

01:24:23.057 --> 01:24:24.892
Jerome, now you
get back here right now.

01:24:24.927 --> 01:24:27.235
I said get back here, Jerome!
