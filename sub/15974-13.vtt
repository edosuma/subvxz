<i>Dan: It was the fourth
second-round knockout</i>

01:27:25.877 --> 01:27:27.038
<i>recorded by the middleweight,</i>

01:27:27.112 --> 01:27:29.513
whose next fight will be in June
against Ramon Castilla

01:27:29.581 --> 01:27:31.379
at the MGM Grand
in Las Vegas, Nevada.

01:27:31.450 --> 01:27:33.885
A city, I'm told, that recently
legalized gambling.

01:27:33.952 --> 01:27:35.113
Dan, fill for 15 seconds.

01:27:35.187 --> 01:27:36.177
Our producer, Dana Whitaker,

01:27:36.254 --> 01:27:37.653
has asked me
to fill for 15 seconds,

01:27:37.722 --> 01:27:39.690
-- but I honestly don't have
anything to say. -- Dan...

01:27:39.758 --> 01:27:41.419
-- She's begging me now.
-- Dan...

01:27:41.493 --> 01:27:42.858
Now she seems pretty mad.

01:27:42.928 --> 01:27:44.760
-- Dan... -- You'd all like
her a lot if you met her.

01:27:44.830 --> 01:27:46.127
You're a funny boy, Daniel.

01:27:46.198 --> 01:27:47.393
And that was 15 seconds.

01:27:47.466 --> 01:27:49.195
-- Casey?
-- That does it for us.

01:27:49.267 --> 01:27:51.395
I'm Casey McCall
alongside Dan Rydell.

01:27:51.470 --> 01:27:53.336
I'm off tomorrow,
but I'll be back on Friday.

01:27:53.405 --> 01:27:55.533
You've been watching
"Sports Night" on CSC.

01:27:55.607 --> 01:27:56.540
See you later.

01:27:56.608 --> 01:27:57.541
-- Music.
-- Go.

01:27:57.609 --> 01:27:58.906
-- Animation.
-- Go.

01:27:58.977 --> 01:27:59.910
<i>We're out.</i>

01:27:59.978 --> 01:28:01.275
-- Here's the thing.
-- Yes.

01:28:01.346 --> 01:28:03.178
I don't have to take
tomorrow night off.

01:28:03.248 --> 01:28:04.215
Yes, you do.

01:28:04.282 --> 01:28:06.341
I'm saying I could do the show
with you tomorrow.

01:28:06.418 --> 01:28:08.614
And I'm saying when your night
off comes up in the rotation,

01:28:08.687 --> 01:28:09.779
you take the night off.

01:28:09.855 --> 01:28:12.256
Yes, but I'm saying I'm willing
to waive that tradition

01:28:12.324 --> 01:28:13.485
and not take the night off.

01:28:13.558 --> 01:28:15.151
No, what you were saying was
you're a big wuss

01:28:15.227 --> 01:28:16.854
who wants to get out of
his date tomorrow night.

01:28:16.928 --> 01:28:18.157
I don't believe
I was saying that.

01:28:18.230 --> 01:28:19.789
-- I believe you were.
-- And <i>it's</i> not a <i>date.</i>

01:28:19.865 --> 01:28:20.764
I believe it is.

01:28:20.832 --> 01:28:22.231
I'm saying
it's not an actual date.

01:28:22.300 --> 01:28:23.893
-- Right, and I'm saying you're a wuss.
-- Look...

01:28:23.969 --> 01:28:25.903
Can we be men for a second?

01:28:25.971 --> 01:28:27.496
All right,
but just a second.

01:28:27.572 --> 01:28:29.768
-- I really don't want to go.
-- No kidding?

01:28:29.841 --> 01:28:30.933
L-| really don't want to go
on a date,

01:28:31.009 --> 01:28:32.670
and there's no question there's
a way to look at this thing

01:28:32.744 --> 01:28:34.576
that makes it appear
a lot like a date.

01:28:34.646 --> 01:28:37.047
-- Yes. -- Plus it's a double
date, and it's a blind date.

01:28:37.115 --> 01:28:39.550
On top of which,
let's not forget, it's a date,

01:28:39.618 --> 01:28:42.383
so there's about three different
ways this thing is bad.

01:28:42.454 --> 01:28:43.387
Wow.

01:28:43.455 --> 01:28:44.388
What?

01:28:44.456 --> 01:28:46.015
You're just a really big wuss.

01:28:46.091 --> 01:28:48.059
I'm just saying I don't
have to take the night off.

01:28:48.126 --> 01:28:49.321
-- Tomorrow?
-- Yes.

01:28:49.394 --> 01:28:50.657
It's your night off.

01:28:50.729 --> 01:28:53.130
It is my night off, but I don't
have to <i>take</i> the night off.

01:28:53.198 --> 01:28:54.632
Then it wouldn't be
your night off.

01:28:54.699 --> 01:28:56.064
And I'm saying
I'm okay with that.

01:28:56.134 --> 01:28:57.966
-- I thought you had plans with Gordon.
-- I did.

01:28:58.036 --> 01:28:58.969
You don't anymore?

01:28:59.037 --> 01:29:01.631
No, but now Gordon fixed Casey
up with a woman from his office,

01:29:01.706 --> 01:29:02.798
and it's the four of us.

01:29:02.874 --> 01:29:03.932
What are you doing?

01:29:04.009 --> 01:29:06.103
We're going to see a modern-dance
concert at City Center

01:29:06.178 --> 01:29:08.146
-- and then we're having dinner.
-- That'll be nice.

01:29:08.213 --> 01:29:10.011
-- Casey hates modern dance.
-- So do I.

01:29:10.081 --> 01:29:12.175
But this is the Holly Dixon
Dance Company.

01:29:12.250 --> 01:29:13.615
These were very hard tickets
to get.

01:29:13.685 --> 01:29:15.551
I'm sure you'll all have
a good time.

01:29:15.620 --> 01:29:16.781
I would have had a good time.

01:29:16.855 --> 01:29:18.755
I would have had a wonderful
time sitting with Gordon,

01:29:18.823 --> 01:29:21.349
watching the Holly Dixon Dance
Company and then having some dinner.

01:29:21.426 --> 01:29:23.053
But I don't think
I'll have a good time

01:29:23.128 --> 01:29:27.031
doing the same thing with Gordon,
Casey, and blind-date-lawyer woman.

01:29:27.098 --> 01:29:28.224
Does she like modern dance?

01:29:28.300 --> 01:29:30.234
Who cares, Isaac?

01:29:30.302 --> 01:29:31.463
Certainly not me.

01:29:31.536 --> 01:29:33.868
The point is I can work
tomorrow night if you want.

01:29:33.939 --> 01:29:36.840
No, the point is you don't want to
see Casey out with another woman.

01:29:36.908 --> 01:29:37.841
<i>Another woman'?</i>

01:29:37.909 --> 01:29:39.035
Yes.

01:29:39.110 --> 01:29:41.010
Another woman other than whom?

01:29:41.079 --> 01:29:42.410
Can I please go home?

01:29:42.480 --> 01:29:44.039
That is not true.

01:29:44.115 --> 01:29:45.207
I love my home.

01:29:45.283 --> 01:29:46.842
You are wrong.

01:29:46.918 --> 01:29:48.545
Then enjoy the Holly Dixon
people.

01:29:48.620 --> 01:29:50.054
Holly Dixon Dance Company.

01:29:50.121 --> 01:29:53.056
And I can't believe that you, of
all people, have joined those

01:29:53.124 --> 01:29:55.752
who believe I have anything but
a friendly interest in Casey.

01:29:55.827 --> 01:29:57.056
I can't believe it.

01:29:57.128 --> 01:30:00.359
I can't believe I've been standing
here talking to you this long.

01:30:00.432 --> 01:30:01.831
-- Hey, Isaac --
-- I'm going home, Casey.

01:30:01.900 --> 01:30:02.958
Yeah, I was just thinking,

01:30:03.034 --> 01:30:04.593
tomorrow midnight's
the trade deadline.

01:30:04.669 --> 01:30:06.694
-- Yes? -- There might be
an eleventh-hour trade.

01:30:06.771 --> 01:30:07.761
-- There won't be.
-- There might be.

01:30:07.839 --> 01:30:08.965
-- <i>There won't be.</i>
-- <i>There could be.</i>

01:30:09.040 --> 01:30:10.201
-- Casey --
-- Look...

01:30:10.275 --> 01:30:12.243
<i>Natalie's running the room
for the first time.</i>

01:30:12.310 --> 01:30:13.744
If there's breaking news,
I should be there.

01:30:13.812 --> 01:30:15.610
-- <i>To</i> do <i>what?</i>
-- <i>The things I do.</i>

01:30:15.680 --> 01:30:16.613
Good night.

01:30:16.681 --> 01:30:17.614
Isaac --

01:30:17.682 --> 01:30:18.911
-- Casey's right.
-- I am?

01:30:18.984 --> 01:30:20.748
Yes, except I should be
the one to stay

01:30:20.819 --> 01:30:23.618
because of the trade deadline
and because Casey won't be here.

01:30:23.688 --> 01:30:24.587
<i>I Will</i> be here.

01:30:24.656 --> 01:30:26.647
You don't have to be here.
I can be here.

01:30:26.725 --> 01:30:27.658
Any chance I can not be here?

01:30:27.726 --> 01:30:28.784
Isaac --

01:30:28.860 --> 01:30:32.319
I've talked to four people in the
G.M.'s office, including the G.M.

01:30:32.397 --> 01:30:34.058
they are not making the trade.

01:30:34.132 --> 01:30:36.328
Nothing is going to happen
at the eleventh hour.

01:30:36.401 --> 01:30:37.891
Natalie's show will be simple.

01:30:37.969 --> 01:30:40.404
Both of you are off.
ls there anything else?

01:30:40.472 --> 01:30:42.201
-- It is possible...
-- I'm just saying...

01:30:42.274 --> 01:30:44.265
Good.
I'll see you both Friday.

01:30:46.745 --> 01:30:49.442
Well, you seem awfully eager
to bail on your date.

01:30:49.514 --> 01:30:51.414
-- It's not a date.
-- It <i>is</i> a date.

01:30:51.483 --> 01:30:54.714
And it seems to me your reason for
wanting to work tomorrow night

01:30:54.786 --> 01:30:58.051
has a lot to do with not wanting
to see Gordon and me on a date.

01:30:58.123 --> 01:31:01.320
It seems to me the reason you're
practically tackling Isaac to the ground

01:31:01.393 --> 01:31:04.294
is because you don't want to see me go
out on a date with anyone who isn't you.

01:31:04.362 --> 01:31:05.955
-- Casey.
-- I'm excited for this date.

01:31:06.031 --> 01:31:06.964
No, you're not.

01:31:07.032 --> 01:31:08.864
Particularly
the Hickory Dickory Dancers.

01:31:08.933 --> 01:31:10.594
The Holly Dixon Dance Company,

01:31:10.669 --> 01:31:12.967
and don't think
I don't know your M.O.

01:31:13.038 --> 01:31:14.972
-- I don't have an M.O.
-- Yes, you do.

01:31:15.040 --> 01:31:18.408
My M.O. is to experience lively
conversation, fine dining,

01:31:18.476 --> 01:31:21.411
and some of the best interpretive
dancing money can buy.

01:31:21.479 --> 01:31:24.176
No, you think at a certain point
during the evening,

01:31:24.249 --> 01:31:26.980
you'll say something wonderful
to me, and I'll melt,

01:31:27.052 --> 01:31:30.044
and that'll teach me for going
out with Gordon instead of you.

01:31:30.121 --> 01:31:31.885
I'll settle for you spilling
something on yourself.

01:31:31.956 --> 01:31:34.357
-- I'll see you tomorrow.
-- Yes, you will.

01:31:37.228 --> 01:31:39.856
<i>Jeremy: Am I the only one who thought they
were gonna make the trade? Natalie: Yes.</i>

01:31:39.931 --> 01:31:41.194
I really thought
they were gonna make the trade.

01:31:41.266 --> 01:31:42.995
-- And I was pretty certain they weren't.
-- I know.

01:31:43.068 --> 01:31:46.299
In fact, I'm pretty sure I bet you $5
they weren't gonna make the trade.

01:31:46.371 --> 01:31:48.999
-- Yes, I know. -- You took the position
that they were gonna make the trade,

01:31:49.074 --> 01:31:51.600
and I was an advocate for the
notion that they were not.

01:31:51.676 --> 01:31:53.007
These are all things
that I know.

01:31:53.078 --> 01:31:55.672
-- Do you know you owe me $5? --
The trade deadline's midnight.

01:31:55.747 --> 01:31:57.146
I'm gonna want a crisp $5 bill,

01:31:57.215 --> 01:31:59.343
not some raggedy-ass thing
from the newsstand.

01:31:59.417 --> 01:32:00.612
<i>Yeah, yeah.</i>

01:32:00.685 --> 01:32:01.948
Bumpers in and out of 10.

01:32:02.020 --> 01:32:04.614
We'll tease Villanova for now,
but that might change.

01:32:04.689 --> 01:32:05.918
Elliott, where are we on time?

01:32:05.990 --> 01:32:07.958
Uh, we need a buck fifty back.

01:32:08.026 --> 01:32:09.892
-- What can we cut?
-- Formula 1.

01:32:09.961 --> 01:32:12.453
That's good film.
Let's bump Oksana Baiul.

01:32:12.530 --> 01:32:13.895
-- Oksana Baiul?
-- Lose it.

01:32:13.965 --> 01:32:16.297
The Ukrainian jewel,
Oksana Baiul?

01:32:16.368 --> 01:32:18.735
-- Yes.
-- You can't bump Oksana Baiul.

01:32:18.803 --> 01:32:20.396
And yet look how I just did.

01:32:20.472 --> 01:32:21.405
Here at 6:00.

01:32:21.473 --> 01:32:23.965
Will, Chris, Dave,
I can count on you guys tonight?

01:32:24.042 --> 01:32:26.568
-- Absolutely. -- Big night.
-- Natalie's running the room.

01:32:26.644 --> 01:32:27.736
Nat, you got a sec?

01:32:27.812 --> 01:32:28.870
-- One sec. Kim?
-- Yeah?

01:32:28.947 --> 01:32:30.415
<i>Should we hold off
in the 40s?</i>

01:32:30.482 --> 01:32:31.779
-- <i>Tampa Bay?</i>
-- <i>Should we wait?</i>

01:32:31.850 --> 01:32:33.443
-- I'd wait till 10:00.
-- Tell Elliott. -- Okay.

01:32:33.518 --> 01:32:34.451
How can I help you?

01:32:34.519 --> 01:32:36.851
-- First let me say this is an
exciting night for you. -- Yes.

01:32:36.921 --> 01:32:38.514
-- We're all very excited for you.
-- Thanks.

01:32:38.590 --> 01:32:40.183
-- 'Cause it's exciting.
-- What do you need, Dan?

01:32:40.258 --> 01:32:41.726
-- Special night.
-- It's no big deal.

01:32:41.793 --> 01:32:43.727
-- It's a very big deal.
-- What do you need?

01:32:43.795 --> 01:32:46.662
You know I would never question your
choice of substitute anchor, right?

01:32:46.731 --> 01:32:49.029
-- Right. -- I mean, this is your
first time stepping in for Dana.

01:32:49.100 --> 01:32:50.363
These are your decisions
tonight.

01:32:50.435 --> 01:32:53.097
I would never second-guess you, and
I would certainly never question

01:32:53.171 --> 01:32:54.468
your choice
of substitute anchor.

01:32:54.539 --> 01:32:57.167
-- So what's on your mind? -- I-l question
your choice of substitute anchor.

01:32:57.242 --> 01:32:59.176
-- Bobbi's fine.
-- She's better than fine.

01:32:59.244 --> 01:33:01.235
-- She's very good.
-- She's very, very good.

01:33:01.312 --> 01:33:02.677
-- So what's the problem?
-- There's no problem.

01:33:02.747 --> 01:33:05.011
-- It sounded like there was a problem.
-- I'm not spreading ill will here.

01:33:05.083 --> 01:33:07.415
That should be clear. I'm not
dropping a dime on anybody.

01:33:07.485 --> 01:33:09.078
Where I come from, we don't
say things about people.

01:33:09.154 --> 01:33:10.519
-- You come from Connecticut.
-- That's right.

01:33:10.588 --> 01:33:12.454
You don't say things about
people in Connecticut?

01:33:12.524 --> 01:33:14.049
-- We do not.
-- What's the problem?

01:33:14.125 --> 01:33:14.956
-- Bobbi's a lunatic.
-- Dan --

It was Spain.
