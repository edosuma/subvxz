Great!

To start
today's adventure,

01:26.319 --> 01:27.853
[Marina] There they are!

- [Bucky rings bell]
- [all] Ahoy, Marina!

01:29.890 --> 01:32.257
Welcome to
Mermaid Lagoon!

01:32.259 --> 01:35.094
- [burbling]
- [giggles]

01:35.096 --> 01:36.728
That's right, Octopus.

01:36.730 --> 01:38.864
Welcome most of all
to you, Bucky!

01:38.866 --> 01:41.600
- [bell rings]
- Bucky!

01:41.602 --> 01:44.036
- Yippee!
- Yeah!

01:44.038 --> 01:47.272
We've got a big
surprise for you!

01:47.274 --> 01:52.277
[clears throat] Bucky, we,
the crew of the best ship ever,

01:52.279 --> 01:56.348
bestow upon you the greatest
honor a ship can receive!

01:56.350 --> 01:59.251
In recognition
of your bravery at sea,

01:59.253 --> 02:01.420
loyalty to your crew...

02:01.422 --> 02:03.355
And because you're so cool...

02:03.357 --> 02:06.692
We present you
with your very own...

02:06.694 --> 02:11.029
- [Skully sings fanfare]
- [all] Golden anchor!

02:11.031 --> 02:13.332
[bell ringing]

02:13.334 --> 02:17.669
[Hook] What are those
popinjays up to now?

02:17.671 --> 02:21.640
[gasps] A golden anchor!

02:21.642 --> 02:23.375
So shiny! So new!

02:23.377 --> 02:26.111
While I, Captain Hook, am stuck

02:26.113 --> 02:29.648
with this miserable excuse
for an anchor.

02:29.650 --> 02:32.918
Now, sir, it just needs
a little polishing, is all!

02:32.920 --> 02:35.420
[wheezing]

02:37.757 --> 02:41.293
The    <i>Jolly Rog</i>deserves
that golden anchor!

02:41.295 --> 02:44.296
To Mermaid Lagoon!

02:46.367 --> 02:50.435
it's time to attach
the new anchor to Bucky.

02:50.437 --> 02:52.037
- [gasps]
- Huh?

02:52.039 --> 02:54.406
- [sawing noise]
- Crackers! What's that noise?

02:57.343 --> 02:59.711
- [anchor clangs]
- [all] What?

02:59.713 --> 03:03.882
- [cackling]
- [all] Captain Hook?

03:03.884 --> 03:06.385
That anchor
belongs to Bucky!

03:06.387 --> 03:08.820
You are mistaken, Jake.

03:08.822 --> 03:11.423
An anchor this stunning
will look much more at home

03:11.425 --> 03:16.261
on the <i>Jolly Roger</i> than
on that old heap of yours.

03:16.263 --> 03:18.163
We have to get it back.

03:18.165 --> 03:21.400
- [bell rings]
- Bucky, wait for us!

03:21.402 --> 03:24.469
[Skully] Crackers! Bucky's
moving like he's on a mission.

03:24.471 --> 03:27.139
Will you help us
catch up to Bucky?

03:27.141 --> 03:30.742
And get his golden anchor
back from Captain Hook?

03:32.378 --> 03:33.946
[both] Yay-hey!

03:33.948 --> 03:36.415
Remember to keep a lookout
for gold doubloons.

03:36.417 --> 03:40.018
Whenever we solve
a pirate problem together,
they'll appear.

03:40.020 --> 03:43.355
Then we'll collect them and put
'em in our Team Treasure Chest.

03:43.357 --> 03:45.457
Is everybody ready?

03:45.459 --> 03:48.393
- I've got my sword!
- I got my map!

03:48.395 --> 03:50.862
And I've got
my pixie dust!

03:50.864 --> 03:54.266
The fairies gave it to me
so that we can use it to fly.

03:54.268 --> 03:56.134
But only in emergencies!

03:56.136 --> 03:58.370
Yo-ho, let's go!

03:58.372 --> 04:02.841
But how are we gonna catch up
with our ship... without a ship?

04:02.843 --> 04:05.277
[gasps] Look!
Over there!

04:05.279 --> 04:09.181
That old sailboat wreck. You
could catch up to Bucky in that.

04:09.183 --> 04:10.849
Good idea, Marina.

04:10.851 --> 04:14.152
It's no Bucky, but I think
we can make it work.

04:16.389 --> 04:20.759
Barnacles! The puny pirates
are gaining on me.

04:20.761 --> 04:23.428
[both] Heave-ho!

04:23.430 --> 04:27.032
Heave-ho!
Heave-ho!

04:27.034 --> 04:32.104
Good! That floating fence
should slow down the popinjays.

04:33.940 --> 04:36.341
Your plan is
working, cap'n!

04:36.343 --> 04:38.443
[Hook laughs]

04:38.445 --> 04:42.547
- Farewell, popinjays!
- [bell ringing]

04:45.285 --> 04:47.486
[chittering]

04:58.231 --> 04:59.564
[bell ringing]

05:02.969 --> 05:04.870
[all straining]

05:06.239 --> 05:09.274
What do you know,
the old boat floats.

05:09.276 --> 05:11.910
But the sail is full of holes!

05:11.912 --> 05:14.279
And there aren't
any paddles on board!

05:14.281 --> 05:18.050
- How can we get moving?
- The octopus could do it.

05:18.052 --> 05:21.153
With his legs over
the side, he can kick.

05:21.155 --> 05:23.221
[burbling]

05:25.325 --> 05:30.062
Thanks, Mr. Octopus!
Yay-hey, we're on our way.

05:30.064 --> 05:32.564
And we got three gold doubloons!

05:32.566 --> 05:36.101
Let's grab them and
go catch up with Bucky.

05:36.103 --> 05:39.237
<i>¶ Yo-ho, mateys, away! </i>

05:39.239 --> 05:41.873
<i>¶ There'll be treasure</i>

05:41.875 --> 05:43.241
<i>¶ Let's go </i>

05:43.243 --> 05:46.311
<i>¶ Heave ho, here we go</i>
<i>Together as a team ¶</i>

05:46.313 --> 05:49.348

05:49.350 --> 05:51.416
<i>¶ And me </i>

05:54.253 --> 05:55.987
[Hook] Bilge water!

05:55.989 --> 05:59.958
The popinjays somehow
got past my floating fence.

05:59.960 --> 06:03.395
Cap'n, sir,
fog bank dead ahead.

06:04.330 --> 06:07.566
Excellent!
Sail directly into it.

06:07.568 --> 06:10.268
All right. But, cap'n...

06:10.270 --> 06:13.572
We won't be able to see our
nose on our face in that fog.

06:13.574 --> 06:16.074
If we can't see anything,

06:16.076 --> 06:19.177
neither can the
itty-bitty pirates!

06:19.179 --> 06:23.348
Into the fog!
That is an order.

06:25.952 --> 06:29.321
Oh, my! I really
can't see a thing!

06:29.323 --> 06:33.024
[Sharky] Oy!
Which way do we go?

06:33.026 --> 06:35.360
<i>¶ Which way do we go?</i>
<i>Which way do we go? ¶</i>

06:35.362 --> 06:37.362
<i>¶ Heave-ho, oh, no </i>

06:37.364 --> 06:40.332
<i>¶ Which way do we go</i>
<i>when we're lost at sea? ¶</i>

06:40.334 --> 06:43.034
<i>¶ Which way do we go</i>
<i>when we can't see a thing? ¶</i>

06:43.036 --> 06:45.036
<i>¶ Nothing for a mate</i>
<i>to do but sing ¶</i>

06:45.038 --> 06:46.972
<i>¶ Heave-ho, oh, no </i>

06:46.974 --> 06:49.474
<i>¶ Which way do we go</i>
<i>when we're lost at sea? ¶</i>

06:51.177 --> 06:52.444
[bell rings]

06:54.247 --> 06:56.481
[cackling]
We're out of the fog,

06:56.483 --> 06:59.184
and we lost
the sea pups.

06:59.186 --> 07:03.422
Now we sail away
and they say goodbye

07:03.424 --> 07:07.492
- to their golden anchor!
- [Bucky's bell rings]

07:18.271 --> 07:19.504
[Skully]
Hook's getting away!

07:19.506 --> 07:22.007
[Izzy] But Bucky's
nowhere in sight.

07:22.009 --> 07:24.409
Maybe he's lost
in that thick fog.

07:24.411 --> 07:28.413
That huge cloud of fog hides
the Swirling Whirling-Pool.

07:28.415 --> 07:31.183
[all] The Swirling
Whirling-Pool?!

07:31.185 --> 07:34.186
[bell ringing]

07:34.188 --> 07:37.155
It's Bucky.
He's calling for help!

07:37.157 --> 07:39.558
I know my way around the
Swirling Whirling-Pool.

07:39.560 --> 07:41.159
I can lead you.

07:45.398 --> 07:46.498
[bell ringing]

07:46.500 --> 07:49.201
We're glad to see you,
too, Bucky.

07:49.203 --> 07:52.003
We'll tow you out. Catch!

07:53.506 --> 07:58.543
- [Marina straining]
- [bell ringing]

07:58.545 --> 08:01.446
Bucky's right,
we need more power!

08:01.448 --> 08:04.483
I know who can help.
[whistles]

08:07.186 --> 08:10.622
- [chittering]
- Ahoy, dolphins.

08:10.624 --> 08:13.525
Bucky is heading for the
Swirling Whirling-Pool.

08:13.527 --> 08:18.396
- Can you help us save him?
- [chittering]

08:18.398 --> 08:20.232
Thanks, mateys!

08:24.437 --> 08:27.405
Everybody,
paddle hard with us.

08:33.613 --> 08:36.548
- [Bucky's bell ringing]
- Bucky's safe!

08:36.550 --> 08:39.518
- That was close!
- Wa-hoo!

08:39.520 --> 08:41.453
Well done!

08:41.455 --> 08:44.022
- [bell ringing]
- You're welcome, Bucky!

08:44.024 --> 08:46.024
We'd never let you down.

08:46.026 --> 08:49.761
We saved you from going down
The Swirling Whirling-Pool!

08:49.763 --> 08:52.464
And got five more
gold doubloons.

08:52.466 --> 08:55.534
Let's grab 'em and go get
Bucky's new anchor back

08:55.536 --> 08:57.402
from Captain Hook.

09:00.373 --> 09:03.275
Oh, Mr. Smee,
what an honor it is

09:03.277 --> 09:05.377
to receive
this golden anchor.

09:05.379 --> 09:08.713
Well, cap'n, I'm not sure
it's such an honor

09:08.715 --> 09:10.749
to take something that isn't...

09:10.751 --> 09:13.184
[dolphins chittering]

09:14.053 --> 09:16.388
[exclaims]
Wild dolphins, cap'n!

09:16.390 --> 09:20.458
They took me hat. Imagine!

09:20.460 --> 09:24.195
Taking something that
doesn't belong to you.

09:26.699 --> 09:30.402
Stop this at once,
foul beasts of the deep!

09:30.404 --> 09:32.537
Don't you know who I am?

09:32.539 --> 09:36.274
- I am the legendary...
- [Jake] Captain Hook!

09:36.276 --> 09:38.410
[Bucky's bell ringing]

09:39.645 --> 09:41.379
- Yay-hey!
- Whee!

09:42.481 --> 09:44.816
I thought I lost you in the fog!

09:44.818 --> 09:48.386
We're here to take back what
belongs to our friend Bucky.

09:48.388 --> 09:50.188
Here it is,
mateys.

09:50.190 --> 09:51.623
Bucky's
golden anchor.

09:51.625 --> 09:53.825
Let's grab it and go!

09:53.827 --> 09:56.528
[all straining]

09:56.530 --> 10:00.465
Not so easy, is it,
puny pirates?

10:00.467 --> 10:02.400
Make way, mateys!

10:02.402 --> 10:04.836
This calls for
a little pixie dust.

10:04.838 --> 10:07.372
Quick, mateys, hop on!

10:08.441 --> 10:11.276
Blast!
Put that down!

10:11.278 --> 10:13.411
Yo-ho, Bucky!

10:13.413 --> 10:15.580
- [bell ringing]
- [Jake] We need a lift!

10:19.685 --> 10:21.586
[all] Yeah!

10:25.257 --> 10:29.461
- Bye-bye, Captain Hook!
- Blast you, puny pirates!

10:29.463 --> 10:34.232
- Blast you!
- Yo-ho, way to go!

10:34.234 --> 10:36.668
We got Bucky's
golden anchor back.

10:36.670 --> 10:40.238
And we got three more
gold doubloons!

10:40.240 --> 10:43.608
Let's grab 'em and go
back to Pirate Island!

10:47.813 --> 10:50.248
Enjoy your
new anchor, Bucky!

10:50.250 --> 10:52.350
Now that we've helped Bucky out,

10:52.352 --> 10:56.621
let's put all our gold doubloons
into our Team Treasure Chest.

11:04.263 --> 11:06.464
<i>¶ Way, hey</i>
<i>Well done, crew ¶</i>

11:06.466 --> 11:08.466

Yo-ho! For solving
pirate problems today,

11:31.725 --> 11:33.958
we got 11 gold doubloons!

11:35.261 --> 11:37.495
Thanks for
your help, mateys.

11:37.497 --> 11:38.830
With you on this crew,

Bucky will
always be shipshape.

[Hook gasps] Look!
The Swirling Whirling-Pool!

11:50.444 --> 11:54.345
- Abandon ship!
- Aye-aye, cap'n!

11:58.451 --> 12:01.453
Oh, there goes me ship.

12:01.455 --> 12:04.556
Oh! Good thing I got
my inflatable dinghy.

<i>at the end of the rainbow ¶</i>

12:22.008 --> 12:24.476
<i>¶ Where did all the clouds</i>
<i>and the rain go? ¶</i>

12:24.478 --> 12:27.612
¶ There be treasure at the end
Before it's gone again ¶

12:27.614 --> 12:29.314
Here we go, mateys!

12:29.316 --> 12:31.850
<i>¶ Treasure at the end</i>
<i>of the rainbow ¶</i>

12:31.852 --> 12:35.453
What is this ridiculous racket?

12:35.455 --> 12:38.256
Oh, uh,
sorry, cap'n. Look!

12:39.291 --> 12:44.028
A rainbow. I don't care
about silly rainbows,

12:44.030 --> 12:47.031
I care about treasure!

12:47.033 --> 12:48.666
Well, you know
what they say:

12:48.668 --> 12:51.469
there be treasure at
the end of every rainbow.

12:51.471 --> 12:55.373
Which is why I absolutely adore

12:55.375 --> 12:57.609
these wonderful rainbowy things!

12:57.611 --> 13:00.044
Men, set sail for Never Land,

13:00.046 --> 13:04.816
and the treasure
at the end of that rainbow!

13:07.319 --> 13:10.054
I've never seen
a rainbow like that before.

13:10.056 --> 13:12.056
I bet I know
who made it!

13:12.058 --> 13:14.058
[Pirate Princess]
Ahoy, pirate friends!

13:14.060 --> 13:16.594
[all] Ahoy,
Pirate Princess!

13:18.030 --> 13:20.465
It's not one of my rainbows.

13:20.467 --> 13:23.568
So you didn't
make that rainbow?

13:23.570 --> 13:25.603
Well, it is lovely,

13:25.605 --> 13:28.606
but I couldn't have made it,
even if I wanted to.

13:28.608 --> 13:32.377
Yesterday, I tried to make
a rainbow over Mermaid Lagoon,

13:32.379 --> 13:35.046
but my Rainbow Wand
ran out of colors.

13:35.048 --> 13:38.082
See? No rainbows.

13:38.084 --> 13:40.485
But I know how
I can fix my wand.

13:40.487 --> 13:43.054
That is the
Never Rainbow.

13:43.056 --> 13:44.756
At the end
of the Never Rainbow

13:44.758 --> 13:47.091
is the Dazzle Diamond.

13:47.093 --> 13:49.627
If I tap my wand
on the Dazzle Diamond,

13:49.629 --> 13:51.429
its colors will return

13:51.431 --> 13:53.498
and I'll be able
to make rainbows again!

13:53.500 --> 13:55.900
Can you help me find
this magical stone?

13:55.902 --> 14:01.506
Say, mateys, will you go to the
end of the Never Rainbow with us

14:01.508 --> 14:03.842
to find the Dazzle Diamond?

14:05.344 --> 14:08.847
Great! Remember to keep a
lookout for gold doubloons.

14:08.849 --> 14:12.417
Whenever we solve
a pirate problem together,
they'll appear.

14:12.419 --> 14:15.887
Then we'll collect them and put
them in our Team Treasure Chest.

14:15.889 --> 14:19.591
Yo-ho, let's go
follow the rainbow!

14:23.095 --> 14:26.097
<i>¶ Yo-ho, mateys, away! </i>

14:26.099 --> 14:28.700
<i>¶ There'll be treasure</i>
<i>and adventure today ¶</i>

14:28.702 --> 14:30.068
<i>¶ Let's go </i>

14:30.070 --> 14:33.104
<i>¶ Heave ho, here we go</i>
<i>Together as a team ¶</i>

14:33.106 --> 14:36.407
<i>¶ Jake and the</i>
<i>Never Land Pirates ¶</i>

14:36.409 --> 14:38.042
<i>¶ And me </i>

14:40.846 --> 14:42.513
Hurry, pirate friends!

14:42.515 --> 14:44.849
The Never Rainbow
and its Dazzle Diamond

14:44.851 --> 14:48.753
- will fade away at sunset.
- Don't worry, Princess.

14:48.755 --> 14:51.956
With my crew on board,
we'll find that diamond!

14:51.958 --> 14:54.125
I'm on it, Jake.

14:54.127 --> 14:56.461
To get to the end
of the Never Rainbow,

14:56.463 --> 15:00.064
we have to go past a field
of giant sunflowers,

15:00.066 --> 15:02.033
down a purple path,

15:02.035 --> 15:04.068
which will get us
to the end of the rainbow

15:04.070 --> 15:05.637
and the Dazzle Diamond.

15:05.639 --> 15:08.506
Come on, mateys.
Let's go!

15:11.143 --> 15:14.078
Did you hear that, boys?

15:14.080 --> 15:16.114
The "dazzly" diamond.

15:16.116 --> 15:20.118
It must be the treasure
at the end of the rainbow.

15:21.654 --> 15:24.422
Come on, everybody.
I think we go this way.

15:26.525 --> 15:30.128
Shiver me petals!
Did I do that?

15:30.130 --> 15:34.432
We need to be careful
not to touch any of these
giant sunflowers.

15:34.434 --> 15:38.636
Yeah, if they start spinning,
we'll blow away.

15:38.638 --> 15:40.905
Now that's an idea!

15:40.907 --> 15:43.741
If those puny pirates
blew away,

15:43.743 --> 15:47.011
I could get to the end
of the rainbow first!

15:47.013 --> 15:48.613
Sharky, Bones,

15:48.615 --> 15:52.483
sally forth and make
those sunflowers spin!

15:52.485 --> 15:54.085
Aye-aye, cap'n!

15:57.589 --> 15:59.657
<i>¶ To make sunflowers spin </i>

15:59.659 --> 16:01.826
<i>¶ We rumpy bump into them </i>

16:01.828 --> 16:03.828
¶ We do this for the captain

16:03.830 --> 16:05.863
¶ So he can get that diamond

16:05.865 --> 16:08.132
[scatting]

16:13.939 --> 16:17.575
- Aw, flying coconuts!
- Come on, crew!

16:17.577 --> 16:18.977
We've got to get
through this field

16:18.979 --> 16:20.244
before we
blow away!

16:21.213 --> 16:23.114
[gasps] My wand!

16:23.116 --> 16:27.151
- [exclaims] Help!
- Hold on, Pirate Princess!

16:27.153 --> 16:29.120
[grunts] Gotcha!

16:30.589 --> 16:32.123
[both] Whoa!

16:32.125 --> 16:34.058
Izzy, grab on!

16:34.060 --> 16:36.661
Whoa! This isn't working!

16:36.663 --> 16:38.830
Hang on!

16:38.832 --> 16:42.700
Ah, coconuts!
We need a little more help.

16:42.702 --> 16:44.869
That means me!

16:47.639 --> 16:50.041
Whoo-hoo!
We did it!

16:50.043 --> 16:54.245
Yay-hey! We worked together to
save our crew from blowing away.

16:54.247 --> 16:56.748
And we got three gold doubloons.

16:56.750 --> 16:59.250
Let's grab 'em and go!

17:01.954 --> 17:05.590
Look alive, me hearties!
I spy the purple path.

17:05.592 --> 17:09.193
[Cubby] That's the path
that leads to the end
of the Never Rainbow.

17:09.195 --> 17:11.262
Sunny skies!

17:11.264 --> 17:15.099
We'll soon find the Dazzle
Diamond so I can fix my wand!

17:15.101 --> 17:19.203
I'm afraid that didn't
work out as planned.

17:19.205 --> 17:24.175
I need a new plan to get ahead
of those puny pirates.

17:27.780 --> 17:29.947
[yelling]

17:29.949 --> 17:32.250
- [Jake] Captain Hook?
- [gasps]

17:32.252 --> 17:35.753
Captain Hook must want
the Dazzle Diamond, too.

17:36.822 --> 17:38.990
[all groaning]

17:41.160 --> 17:44.295
What is this
purple goo?

17:44.297 --> 17:48.032
Oh, my, it's the
purple path.

17:48.034 --> 17:50.568
The one that leads
to the Dazzle Diamond!

17:50.570 --> 17:54.906
Ah! I need to trick
those puny pirates

17:54.908 --> 17:57.608
into taking the wrong path.

17:57.610 --> 18:00.244
If only the yellow path
was purple,

18:00.246 --> 18:03.314
then they'd take
the wrong path!

18:04.850 --> 18:06.584
Boys, I think it's time

18:06.586 --> 18:09.821
we paint this
yellow path purple.

18:13.358 --> 18:16.227
[chuckling]
You were right, cap'n,

18:16.229 --> 18:20.164
this berry goo makes
the perfect purple paint.

18:20.166 --> 18:22.200
Your plan is genius!

18:22.202 --> 18:26.170
Now let's take the real
purple path to the diamond,

18:26.172 --> 18:30.308
while Jake and his crew take
the fake purple path, and...

18:30.310 --> 18:32.810
[both] Get hopelessly lost!

18:32.812 --> 18:35.680
Uh, cap'n, slow down!

18:35.682 --> 18:38.716
Are you sure this is
the real purple path?

18:38.718 --> 18:41.018
Captain Hook
is always sure!

18:41.020 --> 18:43.020
Now hide the path,

18:43.022 --> 18:46.190
so those itty-bitty
buccaneers don't follow us.

18:46.192 --> 18:49.393
Bones, which path
are we supposed to hide?

18:49.395 --> 18:52.163
Don't have a clue!

18:52.165 --> 18:54.866
[Sharky] Well,
if we block this path,

18:54.868 --> 18:58.336
- we can't follow the captain.
- Good point.

19:03.175 --> 19:05.409
Step lively, men,
and follow...

19:05.411 --> 19:07.111
[exclaiming] ...me!

19:07.113 --> 19:09.213
[all yelling]

19:10.215 --> 19:12.250
Blast!

19:13.752 --> 19:17.088
Awesome coconuts!
The purple path.

19:17.090 --> 19:20.958
Oh, no! The Never Rainbow's
starting to fade.

19:20.960 --> 19:22.193
We've got to get to the end

19:22.195 --> 19:25.696
before it and the
Dazzle Diamond disappear.

19:26.965 --> 19:29.400
Izzy, Pirate Princess,
slow down!

19:29.402 --> 19:31.869
- Whoops!
- [grunts]

19:31.871 --> 19:35.072
This purple path
isn't really purple.

19:35.074 --> 19:37.208
Someone
painted it purple!

19:39.745 --> 19:41.212
Yo-ho, way to go!

19:41.214 --> 19:43.781
The real purple path
is over here.

19:43.783 --> 19:46.284
What a sneaky trick.

19:46.286 --> 19:50.721
Just the kind of sneaky trick
that Captain Hook likes.

19:50.723 --> 19:53.057
And we almost
fell for it.

19:53.059 --> 19:56.794
- We did fall for it!
- [both laughing]

19:56.796 --> 19:59.230
Well, the good thing is
that we found the purple path,

19:59.232 --> 20:02.333
and we got three more
gold doubloons!

20:02.335 --> 20:06.904
Let's grab them and go
to the end of the Never Rainbow!

20:09.308 --> 20:12.143
- Radiant rainbows!
- Awesome!

20:12.145 --> 20:14.212
[all exclaiming]

20:14.214 --> 20:16.747
[Izzy]
The Dazzle Diamond!

20:16.749 --> 20:19.450
I just need to tap
the Dazzle Diamond,

20:19.452 --> 20:22.386
and my wand will be able
to make rainbows again.

20:22.388 --> 20:27.191
Excuse me, Princess,
but diamonds are
a pirate's best friend!

20:27.193 --> 20:30.261
Izzy, this is an emergency!

20:30.263 --> 20:32.196
Pixie dust away!

20:33.899 --> 20:36.267
Izzy, my wand! Catch!

20:37.769 --> 20:40.404
Come on, we've got to
tap the Dazzle Diamond

20:40.406 --> 20:43.374
with the Pirate
Princess's Rainbow Wand.

20:46.311 --> 20:48.312
Captain Hook,
the Pirate Princess

20:48.314 --> 20:50.081
needs that
Dazzle Diamond!

20:50.083 --> 20:53.384
- You can't take it!
- That's what you think!

20:53.386 --> 20:55.219
That's what I know!

20:57.155 --> 21:00.491
- Pretty colors!
- Oh, barnacles!

21:01.927 --> 21:05.463
Whoa! We fixed the Pirate
Princess's Rainbow Wand

21:05.465 --> 21:08.266
and got four more
gold doubloons!

21:08.268 --> 21:10.301
Let's grab 'em and go!

21:10.303 --> 21:14.238
Ha-ha! Who cares
about a silly wand

21:14.240 --> 21:17.174
when the treasure
is all mine!

21:17.176 --> 21:18.409
Not for long.

21:21.947 --> 21:23.447
[spluttering] What?

21:23.449 --> 21:26.317
Is this some kind of
puny pirate trick?

21:26.319 --> 21:29.320
Nope! The Dazzle
Diamond fades away

21:29.322 --> 21:31.389
when the Never Rainbow
fades away.

21:31.391 --> 21:33.124
[both laugh]

21:33.126 --> 21:37.295
And that's what you call
the end of the rainbow!

21:38.297 --> 21:40.064
I hadn't noticed.

21:44.102 --> 21:46.971
Thanks for helping the
Pirate Princess today, mateys.

21:46.973 --> 21:51.542
Now let's count our gold
doubloons and put 'em
in our Team Treasure Chest.

21:59.151 --> 22:01.285
<i>¶ Way, hey</i>
<i>Well done, crew ¶</i>

22:01.287 --> 22:03.321

22:14.466 --> 22:17.234
[Jake] One, two, three...

22:17.236 --> 22:19.003
[Cubby] Four, five...

22:19.005 --> 22:23.274

eight, nine, ten!

22:23.276 --> 22:26.410
[Jake] Yo-ho! For solving
pirate problems today,

22:26.412 --> 22:28.846
we got ten gold doubloons!

22:29.881 --> 22:33.184
Thanks, pirate friends,
for all your help.

22:33.186 --> 22:34.618
You're welcome!

22:34.620 --> 22:38.055
Izzy, would you like
to try making a rainbow?

22:38.057 --> 22:40.324
Thanks, Pirate Princess!

22:43.161 --> 22:45.396
Cool! Can I try?

22:47.999 --> 22:51.202
Whoa! Rainbow, ahoy!

22:51.204 --> 22:55.573
[Hook] Ooh! I never want
to see another rainbow again!

22:56.274 --> 22:58.109
[hollering]

22:58.111 --> 23:01.345
[chuckling] Oh, cap'n,
you're very colorful.

23:01.347 --> 23:03.714
I hadn't noticed.

23:03.716 --> 23:06.317
Well, it's a good thing I...
Oh, never mind.

23:09.154 --> 23:12.256
