WEBVTT

03:37.925 --> 03:39.216
Next!

03:46.761 --> 03:48.597
Sorry, girl.
Still can't help you.

03:48.632 --> 03:51.096
Ain't nothing's changed here
since last week.

03:52.433 --> 03:53.439
Okay.

03:55.072 --> 03:56.167
Thank you.

03:57.372 --> 03:58.235
Next.

04:18.966 --> 04:20.765
Valedictorian.

04:27.500 --> 04:28.342
Ah.

07:07.764 --> 07:10.129
Whoa! Wow!

07:10.165 --> 07:11.931
-You did.

07:11.966 --> 07:13.202
Fifty-three, baby!

07:14.838 --> 07:17.407
-Okay! What else?

07:17.442 --> 07:18.479
Like what?

07:34.527 --> 07:37.153
-Whoa!

07:37.189 --> 07:39.230
-Wow.

07:39.266 --> 07:40.798
-Mm.

08:17.329 --> 08:18.599
How much did you say you paid?

08:18.635 --> 08:19.573
Fifteen.

08:20.635 --> 08:22.100
Cents, I hope?

08:22.135 --> 08:25.375
-No. Dollars. Ma!
-Mm-hmm.

08:26.078 --> 08:28.147
You paid three weeks
of ice cream money
for some crackhead--

08:28.182 --> 08:30.109
She is not a crackhead!

08:30.144 --> 08:31.808
You know it's mathematically
impossible--

08:35.487 --> 08:39.155
And for your information,
she has predicted a lot of stuff
that has come true.

08:39.191 --> 08:42.526
-Really? Like what?
-Today, how many<i> platanitos</i>
were in the ba--

08:42.561 --> 08:45.129
-You're joking?
-Ma!

08:54.408 --> 08:55.802
-This year.
-Hmm.

08:55.838 --> 08:57.504
-Shut up!

09:02.578 --> 09:05.512
She said
to keep playing the numbers
Abu always plays.

09:05.548 --> 09:06.818
Clever.

09:08.121 --> 09:12.087
Watch,
when we win, you're going to
be sorry for not believing me.

09:12.751 --> 09:13.550
Okay.

09:15.196 --> 09:16.555
Okay. Just warning you.

09:16.590 --> 09:17.961
Okay.

09:31.111 --> 09:32.173
Hmm.

09:55.498 --> 09:56.593
Mm.

10:29.364 --> 10:31.696
What are you doing?
-Nothing.

10:32.332 --> 10:35.234
Nothing? Then why'd you jump
when I came in?

10:35.269 --> 10:37.337
School stuff... you caught me
off guard.

10:38.045 --> 10:39.174
Okay.

10:42.712 --> 10:44.008
-Give me--
-You're--

10:44.043 --> 10:45.251
-Give me that!
-Shh!

10:45.286 --> 10:46.720
-I thought--
-Shh!

10:47.723 --> 10:50.655
-Did you tell Mom?
-No. I don't wanna worry her.

10:50.690 --> 10:53.191
Ooh. Mrs. Perfect's got
a bad side!

10:54.725 --> 10:55.927
This isn't bad?!

10:57.056 --> 10:58.663
-Ah!

10:58.699 --> 11:00.792
Bad is bad. No exceptions!

11:08.642 --> 11:10.370
-What?
-Don't do it.

11:11.844 --> 11:13.145
It's fine, Gaby. Relax.
Go do your homework.

11:15.744 --> 11:17.215
-Ceci?
-Hmm?

11:53.551 --> 11:54.711
Hey.

12:41.226 --> 12:44.062
Seriously, though.
When are you gonna stop
carrying that with you?

12:44.097 --> 12:45.806
You look like a weirdo.

12:47.669 --> 12:51.471
If you stare at it long enough,
it kinda looks like a bridge.

12:53.180 --> 12:54.111
So?

12:55.074 --> 12:57.774
So it inspires me.

12:58.851 --> 13:01.286
Reminds me
that I will build them.

13:01.956 --> 13:04.715
Like, for real build them
or like in your mind?

13:06.259 --> 13:07.591
Both.

13:07.626 --> 13:10.325
Okay, freak.

13:10.361 --> 13:12.789
But you can't build a bridge
to Venezuela, homegirl...

13:13.300 --> 13:14.791
you stuck.

14:04.152 --> 14:05.886
I see most
of your classmates regularly.

14:07.316 --> 14:09.118
We've locked down
their choices together,

14:09.153 --> 14:11.683
but I haven't seen you in here
all year.

14:15.196 --> 14:15.962
I--

14:18.564 --> 14:20.730
-I just--
-At this rate, you're gonna
have to start in the spring

14:20.766 --> 14:22.463
and not this coming fall.

14:27.603 --> 14:30.703
I actually wanted to ask you
about Florida Bright Futures.

14:31.706 --> 14:34.706
You're not thinking of staying
in Florida for school...?

14:34.742 --> 14:38.083
-Well--
-Most of your top choices
are out of state.

14:40.218 --> 14:45.322
-I know, but--
-María, with a GPA like yours,

14:45.358 --> 14:48.588
you really shouldn't
be anywhere short
of an Ivy League--

14:49.089 --> 14:50.722
I know, um...

14:52.200 --> 14:52.966
But...

14:54.699 --> 14:55.727
Hmm...

14:56.736 --> 14:57.894
Think you'll get homesick?

15:00.775 --> 15:03.141
Most of you kids do.

15:04.109 --> 15:08.279
American kids?
They don't care.

15:09.415 --> 15:12.348
-They just can't wait
to get out the house!

15:14.952 --> 15:17.914
-Yeah...
-And that speech?

15:19.224 --> 15:21.753
I need you to come in more often
so I can see it.

15:49.851 --> 15:52.986
-Got it.
Here it is. Twice divorced.
-Yes.

15:53.022 --> 15:56.886
All right, well, I see here
that your latest husband, Brent,
removed your--

15:56.922 --> 15:59.994
Well, I am inquiring
about my current adjustment.

16:00.030 --> 16:02.762
Okay. I see. Let me check.

16:02.798 --> 16:04.632
Oh.

16:04.667 --> 16:07.838
Um. There seems to have been
a mix-up because of your last--

16:07.873 --> 16:09.608
uh, because of your maiden name.

16:09.643 --> 16:11.174
It hadn't been adjusted?

16:11.209 --> 16:14.614
Not that I can see,
but I will do it now.

16:14.649 --> 16:17.448
-Please.

16:17.483 --> 16:21.650
-All right, done.
Sorry for the delay.
-A three-year delay.

16:21.686 --> 16:25.488
-I do apologize, but we have had
a serious back up.
-I can see that.

16:25.523 --> 16:27.652
But with this small correction,
looks like you are in line

16:27.687 --> 16:29.757
for final review
between today and tomorrow.

16:29.792 --> 16:32.024
You should be getting
a response within
the next few weeks.

16:33.127 --> 16:37.195
-How many weeks?
-We are experiencing a back up,
ma'am, so I can't be sure,

16:37.231 --> 16:39.600
but within the next few weeks
you should be getting a response
in the mail.

16:40.867 --> 16:42.471
But if you could at least
give me an estimate--

16:42.506 --> 16:44.640
Sorry, ma'am.
That's all the information
I have.

16:44.675 --> 16:48.545
But you can always call
our hotline for updates.
One sixty-two!

16:48.580 --> 16:54.811
<i> Now serving</i>
<i>B-3-0-9 at window number 13.</i>

16:54.846 --> 16:57.849
<i>-Now serving S-9...</i>

17:23.445 --> 17:24.579
María?

17:25.245 --> 17:26.251
Care to join us?

17:26.882 --> 17:28.220
María?!

17:30.119 --> 17:32.982
Cecilia. María Cecilia.

17:33.017 --> 17:35.760
Your brain frying
from all that brainstorming?

17:35.795 --> 17:37.694
Talking to yourself now?

17:37.730 --> 17:38.923
No, it's just...

17:39.933 --> 17:42.535
-names are important.
-Okay.

17:42.571 --> 17:45.668
So why don't you stand up
for yourself and tell people
what to call you?

17:45.703 --> 17:48.271
I-- I--

17:48.306 --> 17:50.438
What you stuttering for?

17:50.473 --> 17:51.942
You better learn to stand up
for yourself

17:51.977 --> 17:53.771
and get things off your chest.

17:53.806 --> 17:56.047
Keeping things in
causes throat cancer.

17:56.082 --> 17:59.116
-For real. And girl,

17:59.152 --> 18:00.947
you been here more than half
your life.

18:00.982 --> 18:03.455
You should be used
to people chopping up
your name by now.

18:03.490 --> 18:04.487
I know.

18:05.991 --> 18:08.161
Or if it really bothers you,

18:08.926 --> 18:10.020
say something.

18:30.613 --> 18:32.717
-Don't think I forgot,
valedic-freak!
-Oh!

18:38.087 --> 18:40.627
Guess what?!
I just got my full ride
to USC for track!

18:40.662 --> 18:41.725
-What?!
-Yes, girl!

18:41.760 --> 18:43.293
Oh, my God!

18:43.328 --> 18:46.431
-So, uh, party at my house?
-Oh, hell, yeah.

18:46.466 --> 18:48.466
My parents are throwing me
a huge party after graduation.

18:48.501 --> 18:51.171
It's gonna be off the chain.
You should come, too, Ceci.

18:51.206 --> 18:53.835
Oh, I'll make sure
she gets there.
This is huge!

18:53.871 --> 18:58.071
-I know. Yo, I was freaking out.
-I know, you were
driving me nuts.

18:58.107 --> 19:01.070
-Well, it was
really hard competition.
-You're the best runner I know.

19:01.105 --> 19:03.773
-I'm the only runner you know.
-True.

19:03.808 --> 19:05.414
-Whatever.

19:05.450 --> 19:07.484
Oh, shit. We're late.
Okay. My bad. Gotta go.

19:07.519 --> 19:11.287
-Ey. I'm proud of you!
-Thank you!

19:11.322 --> 19:14.319
-Bye, Ceci. Happy birthday!
-Thanks.

19:14.355 --> 19:16.957
And congratulations!

19:16.992 --> 19:20.424
Oh, hey, congratulations.

20:32.939 --> 20:33.933
Hello?

22:29.748 --> 22:31.686
Hel-lo!

22:31.721 --> 22:33.387
-It's Wednesday

22:33.423 --> 22:35.054
<i>and </i> it's your birthday.

22:36.492 --> 22:38.090
We dress up on Wednesdays.

22:38.890 --> 22:40.395
Sorry. I forgot.

22:40.430 --> 22:42.427
Well, don't be sorry! Go change.

22:42.762 --> 22:45.033
Gaby, I really don't want to.

22:45.836 --> 22:48.073
Come on, we'll never win
with you dressed like a slob.

22:48.108 --> 22:49.740
We'll never win regardless.

22:49.776 --> 22:50.806
Hey!

22:51.769 --> 22:52.643
Sorry.

22:54.845 --> 22:57.345
What does what we wear
have to do with anything?

22:57.381 --> 23:00.376
It's just-- it's bad juju.

23:02.857 --> 23:04.787
Come on, please.

23:05.855 --> 23:08.890
-Is this gonna go on all year?
-'Til we win.

23:10.791 --> 23:12.729
-Come on. Hurry up.

23:14.864 --> 23:16.495
-Pick your best outfit.

23:44.796 --> 23:46.057
I can't believe

23:46.092 --> 23:48.095
-I know that long-ass song.

23:48.130 --> 23:50.302
You've been hanging
out with us for too long.

23:50.337 --> 23:52.598
-Okay, come on!

23:52.633 --> 23:54.331
-What?

24:07.912 --> 24:09.547
Oh!

24:16.827 --> 24:18.564
I'll explain later.
-Okay.

25:53.684 --> 25:55.353
<i>We apologize for the delay.</i>

25:55.389 --> 25:58.361
<i>All of our agents are still</i>
<i>assisting other calls.</i>

25:58.396 --> 26:00.831
-Ow!

26:03.134 --> 26:04.296
Hmm?

26:13.807 --> 26:17.773
-<i> All right,</i>
<i>ma'am. Sorry about that.</i>
-No problem.

26:17.808 --> 26:22.616
<i>-So it looks like it is finally</i>
<i>being reviewed--</i>
-Oh, thanks God.

26:22.651 --> 26:27.255
<i>And you should be getting</i>
<i>a response in the mail</i>
<i>within one to 12 weeks.</i>

26:27.290 --> 26:31.296
-Twelve?
<i>-That is correct, due to</i>
<i>the high volume of callers.</i>

26:31.331 --> 26:34.728
<i>If there is anything else</i>
<i>we can help you with,</i>
<i>please visit our website.</i>

26:34.763 --> 26:40.204
-Well, if at least you--
<i>-And don't forget to fill out</i>
<i>the survey on our service!</i>

26:42.835 --> 26:44.105
Okay.

27:04.932 --> 27:05.698
Nah...

27:55.508 --> 27:58.308
Supervisor said
the same thing.

27:58.343 --> 28:00.951
Gotta be the original.
Sorry, honey.

28:02.088 --> 28:02.953
Okay.

28:04.685 --> 28:05.681
Thank you.

28:06.752 --> 28:07.683
María!

28:09.993 --> 28:12.695
But I'll see if there's
anything I can do.

28:12.731 --> 28:15.559
If there is,
you'll get a email.

29:11.725 --> 29:12.825
Yeah, I went during lunch.

29:14.228 --> 29:14.992
Damn.

29:15.623 --> 29:16.653
Yup.

29:22.768 --> 29:26.972
-Yo! Defender of the people!
-Hey!

29:27.007 --> 29:31.067
-Look at my dorm!
-Oh, my God! Look!

29:31.103 --> 29:34.113
I got my dad to make me
a cute little neon 305 sign
to hang over the bed.

29:34.148 --> 29:37.246
-Did you figure
yours out yet?

29:37.281 --> 29:39.611
You know my mom's tripping.

29:39.646 --> 29:41.620
-Trying to make me
stay home for school.

29:41.655 --> 29:43.252
But I've been fighting
the good fight.

29:43.287 --> 29:45.816
-Your girl's gonna be
a lawyer someday!

29:45.852 --> 29:49.057
Listen,
you gon' build yo' bridges,
I'm gonna fight injustices,

29:49.092 --> 29:50.958
and you gon' run after
everybody. Trifecta.

29:50.994 --> 29:54.428
-Watch out, America.

29:54.463 --> 29:56.632
-You going to Jabari's tonight?
-I got my mom's car!

29:56.668 --> 29:58.660
-Scoop me?
-Yeah! Duh.

29:58.695 --> 30:00.270
We should have
a designated driver, though.

30:00.305 --> 30:02.303
True.

30:05.004 --> 30:06.437
Oh, no, I can't.

30:06.472 --> 30:08.237
-Come on!
-You don't even drink!

30:08.272 --> 30:10.239
-I don't.
-So then?

30:10.274 --> 30:12.808
-Well, I--
-You what?

30:13.949 --> 30:15.815
-I can't.
-Ugh! Lame.

30:15.851 --> 30:17.483
Seriously. Come on.

30:20.452 --> 30:22.488
-Oh, shit.

30:24.157 --> 30:27.323
She's got something to do.
We'll figure something else out,
though, Ash. We good.

30:27.358 --> 30:30.133
-All right.
-And I gotta go!

30:30.168 --> 30:32.329
Final disbursement scholarship
letters come in today!

30:32.365 --> 30:33.870
-Get it, girl!

30:33.905 --> 30:36.003
Ey, don't go spending
your afternoon

30:36.039 --> 30:37.541
brainstorming your brain
to death,

30:37.576 --> 30:39.141
María Cecilia Lopez Lugo

30:39.176 --> 30:42.107
Martinez Rodriguez
Ramirez... Perez!

30:42.143 --> 30:43.949
-See ya!
-Bye.

31:17.748 --> 31:18.544
Vee!

31:20.785 --> 31:22.521
Brent. What are you doing here?

31:22.556 --> 31:24.286
I, uh... I live around here.

31:24.884 --> 31:25.881
I know.

31:29.122 --> 31:31.887
You're stunning as ever.

31:36.403 --> 31:37.893
Uh, I... uh...

31:39.796 --> 31:42.163
I thought I saw you over there
at the light

31:42.199 --> 31:44.438
-and so I wanted to come
over here and talk to you.
-I'm working.

31:46.605 --> 31:48.640
Vee, I feel really bad
about what I did.

31:50.247 --> 31:52.446
Here, let me-- let me help you.
Let me help you.

31:55.147 --> 31:56.912
Yeah, there, yeah.

32:00.119 --> 32:01.323
Will you, um...

32:02.958 --> 32:05.128
do you think you could

32:05.163 --> 32:06.856
give me a chance to show you
that I've changed?

32:22.947 --> 32:25.809
-Hello?!
-Sorry!

32:27.287 --> 32:28.987
So?

32:29.022 --> 32:32.720
-Car wash boss.
He didn't ask any ques--
-Shh!

32:32.756 --> 32:35.556
-They don't even speak English!
-I don't care, keep your voice
down.

32:36.091 --> 32:38.457
Okay, so did he?

32:38.492 --> 32:40.494
No. I told you it was just
to shelve it.

32:41.627 --> 32:44.960
-And what about Miami-Dade?
-Nothing yet.

32:46.673 --> 32:48.606
So then, what does that mean?

32:48.641 --> 32:51.406
-Out of state.
-So?

32:53.311 --> 32:55.971
-Nothing, I don't wanna talk
about it.
-Fine.

32:58.311 --> 33:01.010
-You're a genius!
-Hmm.

33:01.880 --> 33:04.315
You are! Mine's going to be
the best in the class.

33:04.350 --> 33:06.684
Mm, not so fast... .

33:06.719 --> 33:09.824
Put it back together!
-What?!

33:09.859 --> 33:12.593
How are you
gonna do your presentation
if you don't know how it works?

33:12.629 --> 33:13.824
Ugh!

34:32.242 --> 34:33.842
-Hello?

38:45.662 --> 38:48.367
-<i> Hello?</i>

39:20.425 --> 39:21.400
Hmm.

41:03.494 --> 41:05.762
There are lotto
drawings on Saturdays, too!

41:05.798 --> 41:08.134
That doubles our chances.

41:08.170 --> 41:10.834
Don't tell me
we have to dress up
on weekends now, too.

41:10.869 --> 41:13.471
Duh. Gonna go get that ticket.

41:16.444 --> 41:19.749
Make it casual Saturdays!
Maybe it brings better luck.

41:30.722 --> 41:31.728
Hmm?

41:57.220 --> 41:58.381
Oh!

42:15.398 --> 42:17.235
Maggy, Saturdays too!

42:18.608 --> 42:21.272
-That's right!

42:39.862 --> 42:41.730
What does that have to do
with anything?

42:41.766 --> 42:44.930
I don't know.
Those things are truth.

42:45.599 --> 42:48.535
I still feel some type of way
every time I see Jabari
in fourth period.

42:51.209 --> 42:52.670
That's different.

42:53.540 --> 42:56.344
I think he should come here
and they should get
back together.

42:56.380 --> 42:58.879
-Who?
-Your pop.

42:58.914 --> 43:02.577
-Oh. It doesn't work like that.
-Why not?

43:03.985 --> 43:07.582
-He has work there.
-So? He could work here.

43:09.129 --> 43:11.424
He's a lawyer there.

43:11.460 --> 43:13.588
Well, there's no laws
over there right now,
so what's he lawyering?

43:13.966 --> 43:15.128
True.

43:16.569 --> 43:19.596
That place is twisted.

43:19.631 --> 43:20.870
I know.

43:21.672 --> 43:25.208
Hurts to be there.
Hurts to be out.

43:25.243 --> 43:29.113
Ooh, that's good.

43:29.148 --> 43:30.209
Write about that.

43:32.650 --> 43:34.712
-What was that?

43:34.748 --> 43:36.611
What? I don't know.

43:38.750 --> 43:41.490
You don't think
we could get busted
for trespassing here, do you?

43:41.526 --> 43:42.958
No, scaredy-cat.

44:19.991 --> 44:20.765
Brent.

44:38.712 --> 44:39.674
No.

44:58.029 --> 44:59.235
No.

46:22.081 --> 46:23.052
Shit.

46:44.641 --> 46:47.010
Hi. Come in. Come in.

46:55.152 --> 47:00.650
Come on in.
Here, I'll put the chair here
for ya.

47:02.225 --> 47:05.358
There you go!
It's good that you came.
Thank you.

47:10.466 --> 47:11.727
Oh...

47:21.180 --> 47:21.946
Yeah.

47:22.744 --> 47:24.014
This is great.

47:24.844 --> 47:26.082
Oh, this...

47:26.816 --> 47:28.777
-Oh! Sorry.

47:35.052 --> 47:37.258
Okay. Ah.

47:37.725 --> 47:38.853
Hmm

47:40.925 --> 47:41.900
It's...

47:48.337 --> 47:49.906
That's gonna be
like 20 minutes, okay?

47:49.942 --> 47:52.867
-All right, that's fine.
-Here you go. No change.

47:56.514 --> 47:58.643
-Yo!
-Hey!

47:58.679 --> 48:01.177
Look what I inherited
from my ugly-ass brother
for campus!

48:01.213 --> 48:02.652
That's so cool.

48:02.687 --> 48:04.384
Wanna be my first passenger?

48:05.015 --> 48:06.221
Uh...

48:08.025 --> 48:10.159
Don't tell me you're scared
of being towed.

48:11.261 --> 48:13.926
-Can't we get, like,
pulled over for that?
-What?

48:13.961 --> 48:17.000
No. I mean, it's a bike.

48:17.036 --> 48:19.199
-I know, but still--
-Ah, I don't wanna hear it.

48:19.234 --> 48:21.435
You have no choice.
You're coming with me.

48:22.071 --> 48:24.370
But I'm not off 'til like 20,
so...

48:24.406 --> 48:26.802
I'll wait for your
scaredy-cat ass. Ha-ha!

48:36.980 --> 48:40.285
I mean,
if it makes you feel better,
sure.

48:40.320 --> 48:44.358
But...
even if I didn't...

48:46.097 --> 48:48.923
fuck with your petition again,
which I won't--

48:49.734 --> 48:52.531
I would never do that again.

48:53.832 --> 48:57.298
It'd be pretty difficult
for you to keep
that agreement,

48:57.333 --> 49:00.044
you know, legally.

49:01.404 --> 49:02.871
For my peace of mind.

49:05.079 --> 49:08.349
Okay. We'll do that. Sure.

49:09.180 --> 49:11.946
Uh...

49:13.089 --> 49:15.059
I wanna show you
that I've changed.

49:16.595 --> 49:18.062
In due time, I will.

49:22.359 --> 49:24.035
I'm a man of God now.

50:18.481 --> 50:19.849
Go! Go!

50:28.866 --> 50:30.068
There you go!

50:33.034 --> 50:34.569
I'm alive!

51:14.975 --> 51:17.071
That wasn't so bad, huh,
Hesitaty Hennesy?

51:17.814 --> 51:19.579
-No.
-Told ya.

51:21.548 --> 51:23.955
I'm not graying prematurely
for no reason.

51:23.990 --> 51:26.352
There is wisdom sprouting
from this head.

51:26.388 --> 51:29.688
-Shut up.
-It's true!

51:30.794 --> 51:32.790
Ooh. That's good!

51:45.503 --> 51:48.344
Wait. Rice, really?

51:49.775 --> 51:53.384
Whoa.
Sky's blazing tonight, right?

51:54.087 --> 51:56.812
Our spot is Miami's
best kept secret.

51:56.848 --> 51:59.752
Psh.
We're Miami's best kept secret.

51:59.787 --> 52:02.853
-Especially you with your
secretive behind.

52:16.006 --> 52:17.131
That's real.

52:20.777 --> 52:21.674
You know...

52:24.113 --> 52:25.810
I never say this to you, but...

52:27.318 --> 52:28.984
it feels so good
to be able to switch language

52:29.019 --> 52:31.046
and you still understand me.

52:31.624 --> 52:33.147
-Mm.
-Like...

52:34.622 --> 52:37.424
I always feel that people
only know half of me

52:37.459 --> 52:40.022
if I can't also speak to them
in Spanish.

52:42.131 --> 52:43.766
I always say the same thing.

52:52.005 --> 52:53.035
Yo.

52:54.843 --> 52:58.007
I'm really sorry
about that whole
designated driver thing earlier.

53:00.246 --> 53:01.219
It's all right.

54:24.463 --> 54:25.529
Hello?

54:28.266 --> 54:29.307
Hello?

54:49.685 --> 54:51.527
Hi, Mama.

54:53.463 --> 54:55.356
The bosses up top decided
to get picky.

54:56.326 --> 55:00.162
Hmm? I tried to plead for you,
but it... it didn't work.

55:03.140 --> 55:04.507
You can't keep working here.

55:55.686 --> 55:58.088
<i> No. No.</i>

56:47.739 --> 56:48.512
Ceci...

57:30.748 --> 57:33.381
Whoa...

57:34.859 --> 57:36.659
Wifey.

57:37.591 --> 57:39.354
I didn't expect to see you here.

57:44.931 --> 57:47.731
-You missed me?
-Did you call me last night?

57:48.200 --> 57:51.465
-What?
-In the middle of the night.
Was that you?

57:54.276 --> 57:55.546
Maybe.

57:56.881 --> 57:57.911
What?

57:59.313 --> 58:02.476
Why,
I couldn't finish myself off.
I needed to hear your voice.

58:02.511 --> 58:05.948
-Hey, hey, hey.
Come on now. Come on.

58:05.984 --> 58:08.356
Come on.
Give me some of this shit!

58:08.391 --> 58:10.255
-Hey!

58:18.331 --> 58:19.900
Fuck.

58:23.140 --> 58:25.741
I'm sorry. Sorry.

58:30.707 --> 58:31.780
I'm sorry.

1:01:51.550 --> 1:01:53.744
-Hello?

1:03:47.960 --> 1:03:49.031
Hi, Gabs.

1:04:05.075 --> 1:04:06.180
Hey.

1:04:24.159 --> 1:04:26.365
But I still don't know
if I'll have the guts to do it.

1:04:32.176 --> 1:04:34.274
I think you said this one
was your favorite.

1:04:38.075 --> 1:04:40.313
-Is it?
-Yeah!

1:04:44.052 --> 1:04:46.154
It's the first ever
iron arch one.

1:04:48.020 --> 1:04:52.558
It's a mystery how they did it
because so many others had tried
and failed.

1:04:52.593 --> 1:04:53.623
But...

1:04:56.465 --> 1:04:58.498
someway,

1:04:58.534 --> 1:04:59.893
somehow...

1:05:02.032 --> 1:05:03.303
they did it.

1:05:06.775 --> 1:05:08.308
You got this.

1:06:43.539 --> 1:06:46.340
Ladies and gentlemen,
without further ado,

1:06:46.376 --> 1:06:48.806
-your valedictorian,
María Lopez.
