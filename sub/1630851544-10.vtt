WEBVTT

00:01.088 --> 00:02.306
<i>Previously on</i> SWAT...

00:02.350 --> 00:04.221
The principal is concerned
about her conduct.

00:04.265 --> 00:05.222
Yeah, but I'm gonna
fix this, okay?

00:05.266 --> 00:07.224
Kelly, you start
this fall.

00:07.268 --> 00:08.399
No way!
Yes, way.

00:08.443 --> 00:09.792
Thank you.

00:09.835 --> 00:11.750
I wanted you to meet
some community activists.

00:11.794 --> 00:14.449
You've earned their trust,
and you have their ear.

00:14.492 --> 00:16.059
I don't have the pull in
the department like I used to.

00:16.103 --> 00:18.148
Partner with some
of the people you met today.

00:18.192 --> 00:20.194
I'm sure they can
make it happen.

00:20.237 --> 00:21.717
Darryl and me, we're starting
a business together.

00:21.760 --> 00:24.111
What's this
- business idea?
- Auto repair shop.

00:24.154 --> 00:26.330
I respect what you're doing,
the sacrifice you're making.

00:26.374 --> 00:29.159
Well, when you really believe
in something, in someone...

00:29.203 --> 00:30.682
It ain't a sacrifice.

00:33.294 --> 00:36.601
Someone took my stuff,
and you messing with me?

00:36.645 --> 00:38.777
People up there are
always watching me,

00:38.821 --> 00:40.388
waiting to steal
from me,

00:40.431 --> 00:41.606
signaling the others,

00:41.650 --> 00:43.739
the way you watching me now.

00:43.782 --> 00:45.436
Not gonna ask you again.
Put the stick down

00:45.480 --> 00:47.395
and show us your hands.

00:47.438 --> 00:48.613
What's going on,
Officers?

00:48.657 --> 00:50.311
Sir, step back
the way you came.

00:50.354 --> 00:51.660
Name's Leroy.

00:51.703 --> 00:54.445
This my auto shop right here.
Dave's a friend.

00:54.489 --> 00:56.099
He ain't looking
for no trouble.

00:56.143 --> 00:57.535
He's a veteran,
working through some things.

00:57.579 --> 01:00.103
They think I won't notice
my stuff missing!

01:00.147 --> 01:01.583
It's not right!

01:01.626 --> 01:03.106
Dave. Talk to me, man.

01:03.150 --> 01:04.455
My partner told you
to step back.

01:04.499 --> 01:06.501
I'm listening. What'd you lose?

01:06.544 --> 01:08.329
It's my swivel head
ratchet wrench.

01:08.372 --> 01:09.591
Now it's gone!

01:09.634 --> 01:11.288
Ah, well, I'm sorry
to hear that, man.

01:11.332 --> 01:14.639
How about I help you look
for it? Or, if you want,

01:14.683 --> 01:17.120
I got some spare wrenches
in the shop.

01:17.164 --> 01:18.774
Have your pick,

01:18.817 --> 01:20.689
all right?

01:24.214 --> 01:26.129
Sir, give me the stick.

01:26.173 --> 01:27.565
Turn around, put your hands
behind your back.

01:27.609 --> 01:29.132
Hey, come on, come on.

01:29.176 --> 01:30.568
He was doing what you asked.
Is that necessary?

01:30.612 --> 01:32.266
We've got it
from here.

01:32.309 --> 01:34.137
So, what, you're just gonna
drag him downtown? For what?

01:34.181 --> 01:36.661
You want to join him?
I told you to get back.

01:36.705 --> 01:38.098
Hey, Leroy.

01:39.186 --> 01:41.666
You out here?

01:44.191 --> 01:45.801
Sergeant Harrelson, SWAT.

01:45.844 --> 01:48.064
All good here, Sergeant.
Just heading out.

01:50.197 --> 01:54.157
Next time an officer tells you
to do something, you listen.

01:54.201 --> 01:56.464
Understood?

02:01.730 --> 02:03.427
You got some
great damn timing.

02:03.471 --> 02:05.125
Came by to pick up
my pop's '64.

02:05.168 --> 02:06.517
He's been nagging
the hell out of me.

02:06.561 --> 02:08.128
You want to tell me
what just happened here?

02:08.171 --> 02:09.346
Same old LAPD.

02:09.390 --> 02:12.175
Hassling a homeless man
for no reason.

02:12.219 --> 02:13.481
I told them he's not a threat,

02:13.524 --> 02:14.656
just wanted
to be left alone.

02:14.699 --> 02:16.397
It's just officers
doing their job.

02:16.440 --> 02:18.747
Maybe they can get
- your friend some help.
- Come on, man.

02:18.790 --> 02:22.577
Dave wouldn't walk into
a police station if he got shot.

02:22.620 --> 02:25.188
Man, they just want
to drive him downtown,

02:25.232 --> 02:26.668
so some psych
can diagnose him,

02:26.711 --> 02:29.584
and then turn him back out.
So, who is that helping?

02:30.715 --> 02:33.414
All right, listen, I'll tell you
what, I got to head out,

02:33.457 --> 02:34.850
but let me put in a call,
check on Dave's booking.

02:34.893 --> 02:36.765
I'll see if there's
anything I can do.

02:36.808 --> 02:38.767
Yeah. Yeah.

02:50.039 --> 02:53.347
And did you always know
you wanted to be a SWAT officer?

02:53.390 --> 02:54.609
Definitely.
Luca family's

02:54.652 --> 02:57.220
always been O.G. SWAT,
but it's more than that

02:57.264 --> 02:59.701
'cause I love what I do.

02:59.744 --> 03:01.572
I get to help people
every day

03:01.616 --> 03:03.574
and keep their families
and neighborhoods safe,

03:03.618 --> 03:05.185
so... how was that?

03:05.228 --> 03:07.317
Great, but the interview's
not over yet.

03:07.361 --> 03:09.319
I still got
more questions.

03:09.363 --> 03:10.799
Look, this article
goes to press,

03:10.842 --> 03:12.366
I'm getting first dibs
on a copy, right?

03:12.409 --> 03:14.281
I don't think Luca
would be more excited

03:14.324 --> 03:15.369
if Oprah was interviewing him.

03:15.412 --> 03:17.240
Oh, Kelly's the excited one.

03:17.284 --> 03:18.502
Her first shot
at writing

03:18.546 --> 03:20.025
for the school paper.

03:20.069 --> 03:21.853
Luca's support
means everything to her.

03:21.897 --> 03:24.029
Let's talk about
when you're not at work.

03:24.073 --> 03:25.117
What do you like to do
on the weekend?

03:25.161 --> 03:26.293
I get up early,

03:26.336 --> 03:27.946
catch some waves at Redondo,

03:27.990 --> 03:29.426
then I cruise over
to Katie's Grill

03:29.470 --> 03:31.907
for the number four
banh mi sandwich

03:31.950 --> 03:33.343
with a Neapolitan shake.

03:33.387 --> 03:34.997
So that's your favorite thing
to do on your day off?

03:35.040 --> 03:36.259
If I wasn't a SWAT officer,

03:36.303 --> 03:38.435
that's what I would do
every day.

03:41.264 --> 03:43.310
Agent Lyons,
great to finally meet.

03:43.353 --> 03:45.399
I heard the DEA
could use our help.

03:45.442 --> 03:47.575
Really appreciate SWAT
stepping in on this, Commander.

03:47.618 --> 03:50.534
No knock on our own SRT,
but given your recent success

03:50.578 --> 03:52.493
against the Corrido cartel,
it only makes sense.

03:52.536 --> 03:53.929
And you've confirmed
the shipment's

03:53.972 --> 03:55.496
in the cartel's pipeline?

03:55.539 --> 03:56.932
All thanks
to you guys convincing

03:56.975 --> 03:58.107
Miguel Velez to cooperate.

03:58.150 --> 03:59.456
His intel's been invaluable.

03:59.500 --> 04:01.110
We play this right,
we could put a real hurt

04:01.153 --> 04:02.372
on their smuggling operations.

04:02.416 --> 04:04.244
My people have eyes
on the route, so as soon

04:04.287 --> 04:06.289
as I get word the shipment's
inbound, I'll let you know.

04:06.333 --> 04:08.509
Ah, SWAT will be ready to roll.
It's what we do.

04:19.041 --> 04:20.782
20-David.
Talk to me. How we looking?

04:20.825 --> 04:23.132
26-David. We're keeping eyes
on the loading bay.

04:23.175 --> 04:24.264
No movement yet.

04:24.307 --> 04:25.830
24-David.

04:25.874 --> 04:27.571
No confirmed sighting
of the cargo. Looks quiet.

04:27.615 --> 04:30.444
All right, it's got to be close.
Stay sharp, keep your eyes open.

04:35.318 --> 04:38.495
Still nothing?
No.

04:38.539 --> 04:40.367
Thanks again for having
our backs on this.

04:40.410 --> 04:41.498
Count on it.

04:41.542 --> 04:43.108
Commander says this is
your white whale.

04:43.152 --> 04:44.327
Spent the last
15 months

04:44.371 --> 04:45.589
tracking cartel
smuggling routes.

04:45.633 --> 04:47.243
This has been
their major pipeline.

04:47.287 --> 04:48.592
Well, shutting them down
is gonna send a message.

04:48.636 --> 04:50.333
When I was working vice,
we'd say it only takes

04:50.377 --> 04:51.943
one domino to fall
for the whole thing to collapse.

04:51.987 --> 04:53.293
You were vice?

04:53.336 --> 04:54.598
Hollywood division, three years.

04:54.642 --> 04:56.992
Then you must know my husband,
Ralph Lyons.

04:57.035 --> 04:59.211
Yeah, Ralph, solid guy.
Tell him he still owes me dinner

04:59.255 --> 05:00.430
and a good shirt
from that one job

05:00.474 --> 05:02.998
- on Sunset.
- I'll hold him to it.

05:07.350 --> 05:08.395
Everything okay?

05:08.438 --> 05:10.135
It's Tuana.
She wants to know

05:10.179 --> 05:11.354
if I'm down to go
to Redondo this Saturday,

05:11.398 --> 05:12.877
grab some dinner
at Katie's Grill after,

05:12.921 --> 05:13.965
just the two of us.

05:14.009 --> 05:15.619
Like on a date?

05:15.663 --> 05:18.405
Oh, yeah. She added the winky
face at the end, that's a date.

05:18.448 --> 05:20.798
You know, it's
probably nothing, but...

05:20.842 --> 05:23.410
those last couple interview
questions Kelly asked you?

05:23.453 --> 05:24.628
That might've been Tuana

05:24.672 --> 05:26.456
trying to suss out
a way to ask you out.

05:26.500 --> 05:28.502
All right, what if I say no,
and she takes it the wrong way,

05:28.545 --> 05:30.417
and it's awkward for her
and Kelly to come around?

05:30.460 --> 05:32.157
No, man. I mean,
she's a grown woman,

05:32.201 --> 05:34.203
just talk to her in person.
You'll be fine.

05:44.213 --> 05:45.432
24-David. I have visual.

05:45.475 --> 05:47.129
Let's go.

06:21.424 --> 06:24.209
Looks like it's going
down. They're unloading.

06:24.993 --> 06:26.516
Counting five

06:26.560 --> 06:29.911
armed suspects.
Plus one, no visible weapon.

06:31.216 --> 06:32.870
That's Ricardo Alvarez,

06:32.914 --> 06:35.046
smuggler for the cartel.
This is his route.

06:35.090 --> 06:36.439
What about the cargo?

06:37.875 --> 06:40.138
- Confirmed.
- We have confirmation.

06:40.182 --> 06:42.402
Luca, Street,
approach from the north side.

06:42.445 --> 06:44.839
Tan and I will come around
from the south.

06:44.882 --> 06:46.406
Let's move in.

06:52.107 --> 06:54.414
22-David, we're in position.

07:04.467 --> 07:06.426
Hondo, cargo's almost loaded.

07:06.469 --> 07:08.863
Move in now. Now!

07:08.906 --> 07:11.300
LAPD! Drop your weapons!

07:15.913 --> 07:18.786
Drop your weapons!
Cover, cover, cover!

07:18.829 --> 07:20.744
Alvarez is in the truck.

07:22.354 --> 07:24.792
- Luca, you got flashbangs?
- Got it, got it, got it.

07:24.835 --> 07:27.272
Tan, get with Street. Don't let
- that truck get out of here.
- Roger.

07:33.148 --> 07:34.018
Now, now.

07:35.933 --> 07:37.892
Down on the ground!
Down on the ground!

07:37.935 --> 07:39.546
On your knees,
on your knees!

07:39.589 --> 07:41.417
Don't even think about it. Down!

07:53.255 --> 07:56.214
Hands in the air.
Don't move!

07:58.347 --> 08:00.305
Get on the ground.

08:00.349 --> 08:01.916
On your stomach,
on your stomach!

08:01.959 --> 08:04.484
Hands behind your back.
Hands behind your back, now.

08:05.354 --> 08:07.443
Got it?

08:07.487 --> 08:09.271
Yeah.

08:12.404 --> 08:13.710
Looks like Lyons
gets her win today.

08:13.754 --> 08:14.711
Luca, do the honors.

08:14.755 --> 08:16.844
You got it, boss.

08:28.595 --> 08:30.771
What the hell is this thing?

08:30.814 --> 08:32.555
It's a portable
rocket launcher.

08:32.599 --> 08:34.731
Not one I've ever seen before.
It ain't U.S.

08:34.775 --> 08:36.603
What happened
to the cartel drugs?

08:36.646 --> 08:38.518
Maybe Agent Lyons can tell us.

08:39.431 --> 08:42.522
Who has eyes on Lyons?

08:52.444 --> 08:55.578
- 25-David. I need an R/
- A here, now. Agent down!

08:55.622 --> 08:58.102
Hey, hey, hey. Hey.
Hey, stay with me.

08:58.146 --> 09:00.452
You know Ralph will have
my ass if you don't.

09:07.068 --> 09:09.897
I'm gonna ride with.
Tell Hondo.

09:09.940 --> 09:11.551
See you back at HQ.

09:22.126 --> 09:25.782
Hondo, this is Agent Frank
Gunther with Homeland Security.

09:25.826 --> 09:28.611
Agent Gunther,
Sergeant Harrelson.

09:28.655 --> 09:29.786
How you doing?

09:29.830 --> 09:31.396
You got any idea
what this thing is,

09:31.440 --> 09:33.485
or what it was doing
at a DEA raid?

09:33.529 --> 09:35.531
Portable BGM-71D.

09:35.575 --> 09:36.924
Anti-tank weapon.

09:36.967 --> 09:38.795
Nothing like them
on the market yet.

09:38.839 --> 09:40.318
At least, not our market.

09:40.362 --> 09:42.059
Well, it looks like
some serious firepower.

09:42.103 --> 09:44.627
Well, I guess it's a good thing
that it's in our hands, now.

09:44.671 --> 09:46.498
Where are the rest
of them?

09:46.542 --> 09:48.283
What do you mean?

09:48.326 --> 09:50.633
We checked the entire yard.
This was the only one.

09:50.677 --> 09:52.287
The alert we received
from the Israeli government

09:52.330 --> 09:55.246
warned that three of these
weapons were stolen in Haifa.

09:55.290 --> 09:58.162
Their intel says all three
were headed to Los Angeles.

09:58.728 --> 10:01.165
So, where the hell
are the other two?

10:41.292 --> 10:43.468
Weapon you recovered
is advanced Israeli arms tech.

10:43.512 --> 10:45.427
The Israelis consider it
still in development,

10:45.470 --> 10:47.081
but what makes it so dangerous

10:47.124 --> 10:49.474
is the cutting-edge
thermic metal technology.

10:49.518 --> 10:51.999
It can penetrate
tank armor like butter.

10:52.042 --> 10:53.348
Ah, a weapon like this...

10:53.391 --> 10:55.437
I mean, the potential
targets are endless.

10:55.480 --> 10:57.178
It could breach our
most fortified buildings,

10:57.221 --> 10:58.527
not to mention what it
could do to Black Betty.

10:58.570 --> 11:00.007
Who knows how many
innocent victims

11:00.050 --> 11:01.617
this weapon could be turned on.

11:01.661 --> 11:03.227
Does this mean the cartel's
getting into the arms business?

11:03.271 --> 11:04.402
That's a
frightening thought.

11:04.446 --> 11:05.708
Only ups the urgency

11:05.752 --> 11:07.318
that we find the other two
launchers right away.

11:07.362 --> 11:09.712
The smugglers we took down
only had one in their cargo.

11:09.756 --> 11:11.714
My guess is, whoever shipped
them is using a redundancy plan.

11:11.758 --> 11:13.194
Yeah, ship three guns,
three different routes,

11:13.237 --> 11:15.718
to ensure that at least one
of them arrives.

11:15.762 --> 11:17.372
Which means someone really wants
to get their hands

11:17.415 --> 11:19.330
on this weapon. Why?

11:19.374 --> 11:21.115
Homeland was only notified
of the theft about a week ago.

11:21.158 --> 11:23.813
No intel yet on what
the potential target might be.

11:23.857 --> 11:26.163
What do we have on our smugglers
from the container yard?

11:26.207 --> 11:28.209
Ricardo Alvarez
was the man in charge.

11:28.252 --> 11:30.254
Started as a foot soldier
for the Corrido cartel,

11:30.298 --> 11:32.387
rose up, and now oversees
smuggling and distribution

11:32.430 --> 11:34.998
- into the U.S.
- Well, if he's the top dog,

11:35.042 --> 11:36.739
he must know where
the weapon was headed.

11:36.783 --> 11:38.175
Have Street and Luca
talk to him.

11:38.219 --> 11:39.742
Agent Gunther can monitor
from Observation.

11:39.786 --> 11:42.092
Homeland appreciates your help
on this one, Commander.

11:42.136 --> 11:43.572
These weapons
are in my city.

11:43.615 --> 11:46.488
Nobody wants them found
as badly as I do.

11:48.359 --> 11:50.057
High casualty weapons.

11:50.100 --> 11:51.754
That's new territoryfor you,

11:51.798 --> 11:53.147
so who were you taking it to?

11:53.190 --> 11:54.844
No idea what that is.
Never seen it before.

11:54.888 --> 11:56.541
We caught you smuggling
this into the city.

11:56.585 --> 11:58.413
You're telling us that you
never looked inside that box?

11:58.456 --> 12:01.068
I made a deal
to deliver a crate.

12:01.111 --> 12:02.765
Didn't ask what was in it.

12:02.809 --> 12:06.116
So, this isn't cartel business.
What then? A side gig?

12:06.160 --> 12:07.378
Job's a job.

12:07.422 --> 12:09.076
I get paid to deliver.

12:09.119 --> 12:11.165
Maybe next time you
want to get a little more info

12:11.208 --> 12:12.862
on what you're smuggling?

12:12.906 --> 12:16.257
Just considering the prison time
you're looking at now. Look,

12:16.300 --> 12:18.302
three of these weapons
were stolen

12:18.346 --> 12:19.477
from an Israeli
arms manufacturer

12:19.521 --> 12:21.001
and sent to Los Angeles.

12:21.044 --> 12:23.394
Now, if any one of them
falls in the wrong hands...

12:23.438 --> 12:25.266
Well, you just went from
being a drug smuggler

12:25.309 --> 12:26.920
to a conspirator
in a terror plot.

12:26.963 --> 12:28.399
And there's a federal
agent in the hospital

12:28.443 --> 12:29.836
fighting for her life
because of you.

12:29.879 --> 12:32.186
Help us, and it might
help your case.

12:32.229 --> 12:33.970
Who were you supposed to
deliver it to?

12:36.843 --> 12:38.801
I never met the buyer.

12:38.845 --> 12:42.283
I was only paid to smuggle the
cargo through my usual route.

12:42.326 --> 12:44.502
Where were you
taking it?
I don't know.

12:44.546 --> 12:46.896
Swear on my mother, I don't.

12:46.940 --> 12:49.203
The buyer told me to download
a coded messaging app.

12:49.246 --> 12:52.815
Said I'd get the location
of the drop when I landed.

12:52.859 --> 12:53.947
Show us.

13:01.955 --> 13:04.087
That's it? Just a number?

13:04.131 --> 13:06.307
That's all I've got.

13:06.350 --> 13:08.439
I tried dialing it, but I don't
think it's a valid phone number.

13:08.483 --> 13:11.051
Well, it's too short
to be a coded text.

13:11.094 --> 13:12.313
What the hell is it?

13:12.356 --> 13:14.315
Address? Password?

13:14.358 --> 13:16.099
This sender's
extra cautious.

13:16.143 --> 13:17.448
Used a redundancy plan
to make sure

13:17.492 --> 13:19.146
that at least one
of the guns came through.

13:19.189 --> 13:21.975
I don't think they'd risk all
their eggs in Alvarez's basket.

13:22.018 --> 13:23.324
If this text is a clue,

13:23.367 --> 13:24.760
it's probably
only half of it.

13:24.804 --> 13:26.283
Search the phone
of the other smugglers

13:26.327 --> 13:27.502
who were with Alvarez
at the container yard.

13:27.545 --> 13:29.025
Maybe we find
the other half

13:29.069 --> 13:30.331
- on one of them.
- All right.

13:30.374 --> 13:31.506
Hey, Commander.

13:31.549 --> 13:34.291
- Got a minute?
- Yeah. What's up?

13:34.335 --> 13:36.859
I walked into a situation
this morning

13:36.903 --> 13:38.992
in front of Leroy
and Darryl's auto shop

13:39.035 --> 13:40.384
involving some officers

13:40.428 --> 13:42.082
responding to an individual
with mental illness.

13:42.125 --> 13:43.866
Leroy stepped
in the middle of it.

13:43.910 --> 13:46.477
It sounded like things might've
gone sideways if he hadn't.

13:46.521 --> 13:47.870
Everyone okay?

13:47.914 --> 13:49.959
Yeah, but this whole thing
put me on to something

13:50.003 --> 13:51.482
that I've been going over
in my head.

13:51.526 --> 13:52.962
Few weeks back,
my girl Nichelle

13:53.006 --> 13:54.790
had me sit down
with community activists

13:54.834 --> 13:57.445
about an initiative
to send trained volunteers

13:57.488 --> 14:00.100
out to mental health
crisis calls instead of cops.

14:00.143 --> 14:02.406
Programs just like this
have worked, sir,

14:02.450 --> 14:04.408
in Harlem, San Diego,
and Oakland.

14:04.452 --> 14:05.932
Fatal encounters
between the police

14:05.975 --> 14:07.759
and the mentally ill
have gone way down.

14:07.803 --> 14:09.065
And you want to start one here?

14:09.109 --> 14:10.458
I'd like your help to trial it.

14:10.501 --> 14:12.547
Well, funding programs
like this,

14:12.590 --> 14:14.070
it means money
coming from somewhere

14:14.114 --> 14:15.680
inside the LAPD budget,

14:15.724 --> 14:17.117
diverting the use
of funds.

14:17.160 --> 14:19.423
And you're already on
thin ice with the brass.

14:19.467 --> 14:20.816
I came back from Mexico
willing to take

14:20.860 --> 14:21.904
whatever they want
to throw at me.

14:21.948 --> 14:23.427
If I want to see
things change,

14:23.471 --> 14:25.081
I know I got to be the one
out there making it happen.

14:25.125 --> 14:27.910
I'm done waiting on the brass
or the system to do it.

14:27.954 --> 14:29.477
All right, you got my backing.

14:29.520 --> 14:31.087
I'll run it up
the chain of command.

14:31.131 --> 14:33.873
I'll let you know
- what I hear.
- Thank you, sir.

14:37.485 --> 14:39.443
Hey.
Hey.

14:39.487 --> 14:40.923
You're just getting back
from the hospital?

14:40.967 --> 14:42.707
Yeah. I stayed until
her husband got there.

14:42.751 --> 14:43.883
We used to
work together.

14:43.926 --> 14:45.145
I wanted him to see
a friendly face.

14:45.188 --> 14:46.886
- How's Agent Lyons doing?
- Still hadn't stabilized.

14:46.929 --> 14:50.106
They were taking her in
for a second surgery. I just...

14:50.150 --> 14:51.847
I keep thinking if, maybe
I'd gotten to her faster...

14:51.891 --> 14:53.109
You were
the first one there.

14:53.153 --> 14:55.024
Sh-She's gonna
keep on fighting, okay?

14:55.068 --> 14:57.897
Yeah, but it's
not just her life.

14:57.940 --> 14:59.463
She's pregnant.

15:00.987 --> 15:03.076
- I had no idea.
- No one did.

15:03.119 --> 15:06.079
Ralph said she wanted to hold
the news until after the raid.

15:06.122 --> 15:08.124
She's not the type
to leave a job half-finished.

15:08.168 --> 15:10.953
I just-- I can't imagine,
for Ralph and her family,

15:10.997 --> 15:12.563
what they must be
going through.

15:12.607 --> 15:15.044
I-I feel so helpless,
like there's nothing I can do,

15:15.088 --> 15:17.133
and I just...
came to work to get away

15:17.177 --> 15:18.830
from feeling like that.
I don't know.

15:18.874 --> 15:20.876
What do you mean?

15:21.877 --> 15:23.661
Did something happen at home?

15:26.142 --> 15:28.666
Bonnie had a miscarriage,
Tuesday night.

15:28.710 --> 15:32.061
Oh... Tan, I'm so sorry.

15:32.105 --> 15:33.628
How's she doing?

15:33.671 --> 15:35.935
Better, I guess.

15:37.023 --> 15:38.502
She's taking
some time off work.

15:38.546 --> 15:40.896
I'm trying to call
and check in when I can.

15:42.593 --> 15:44.987
It happened early, though.

15:45.031 --> 15:46.858
You know, we'd only just
found out she was pregnant

15:46.902 --> 15:49.426
the week before,
but, still, it's, uh...

15:49.470 --> 15:50.862
it's a, it's a lot.

15:50.906 --> 15:52.647
Of course, for both of you.

15:52.690 --> 15:54.866
Bonnie's the one who really
went through it. I'm just...

15:54.910 --> 15:56.868
I'm trying to be there for her.

15:58.958 --> 16:01.003
I'll be fine, okay?

16:07.444 --> 16:08.706
I'm not seeing it yet.

16:08.750 --> 16:10.360
Alvarez says he
doesn't know the buyer,

16:10.404 --> 16:12.362
and this was his only clue
to the delivery location.

16:12.406 --> 16:14.625
That's only half the clue.
Hondo was right.

16:14.669 --> 16:16.192
One of Alvarez's guys

16:16.236 --> 16:18.020
had the same messaging app
on his phone. Another number,

16:18.064 --> 16:20.022
except eight digits
this time.

16:20.066 --> 16:21.502
Code looks like something
I've seen before.

16:21.545 --> 16:22.546
I just can't figure out what.

16:22.590 --> 16:24.722
Hold on.

16:26.594 --> 16:28.813
- Ah, GPS coordinates.
- Nice.

16:28.857 --> 16:30.554
I worked a summer
at the Long Beach Marina.

16:30.598 --> 16:32.165
I spent most
of my time

16:32.208 --> 16:34.080
radioing our coordinates to
pleasure boats from out of town.

16:34.123 --> 16:35.951
Looks like an industrial
supply warehouse.

16:35.995 --> 16:38.040
If that's where Alvarez
was gonna deliver the weapon,

16:38.084 --> 16:41.000
it could be where the other two
are being stored. Let's go.

16:53.012 --> 16:56.015
May not be the first ones here.
Keep your eyes open.

17:10.116 --> 17:11.856
Over.

17:13.075 --> 17:15.947
Street, Tan,
sweep west to north.

17:15.991 --> 17:18.037
Chris, Luca, and I will cover
the southeast side.

17:25.131 --> 17:27.611
Rocket launchers could be
anywhere. Place is crammed full.

17:27.655 --> 17:29.439
It's a good place for storing
what you don't want found.

17:29.483 --> 17:33.052
Luca, go right.
Chris, with me.

17:40.189 --> 17:43.453
All clear in the west aisle.
We're heading north.

17:46.108 --> 17:47.805
26-David.

17:47.849 --> 17:49.894
- I think we got company.
- All right, someone knows we're here.

17:49.938 --> 17:52.158
Keep moving towards
the cargo bay.

18:11.699 --> 18:13.831
Don't move. LAPD!

18:13.875 --> 18:15.703
25-David, we got a runner.

18:16.921 --> 18:19.054
LAPD! Show me your hands!
Cover, cover!

18:20.708 --> 18:24.015
We got one, make that two more.

18:27.715 --> 18:30.805
Down! Hands behind
your back, now!

18:32.894 --> 18:35.026
Stay down. Don't move.

18:37.725 --> 18:39.030
Police. Don't move!

18:39.074 --> 18:41.903
On your knees.
Hands behind your back.

18:43.948 --> 18:45.167
Hondo.

18:45.211 --> 18:47.387
I think we found
what we're looking for.

18:49.650 --> 18:50.999
Nothing.

18:55.873 --> 18:56.961
Same thing.

18:57.005 --> 18:59.094
Launchers are gone.

19:01.052 --> 19:03.664
Who the hell are you, and
what'd you do with the weapons?

19:10.627 --> 19:12.107
Found these
in their ride.

19:12.151 --> 19:13.978
- Israeli passports.
- Yeah, check out

19:14.022 --> 19:16.372
the departure stamps.
They were issued in Haifa.

19:16.416 --> 19:19.549
It's the same place
the weapons were stolen from.

19:19.593 --> 19:21.856
That can't be
a coincidence.

19:22.683 --> 19:24.511
Given your passports,

19:24.554 --> 19:26.730
I got a feeling that we're
all looking for the same thing.

19:26.774 --> 19:28.384
You know what these weapons
are capable of,

19:28.428 --> 19:30.038
and it'll be bad news
for both of our countries

19:30.081 --> 19:31.779
if they end up
in the wrong hands.

19:33.868 --> 19:35.783
We've been tracking the weapons

19:35.826 --> 19:37.785
since they were stolen
from Haifa.

19:37.828 --> 19:39.917
We were sent
by the manufacturer.

19:39.961 --> 19:41.136
Well, then you should've
contacted our department

19:41.180 --> 19:43.094
or the FBI
the moment you arrived.

19:43.138 --> 19:45.401
We were hoping to keep
this whole thing quiet.

19:45.445 --> 19:46.881
Obviously, we're past that now.

19:46.924 --> 19:48.099
How'd you know they were here?

19:48.143 --> 19:50.928
The weapons are prototypes,
preproduction.

19:50.972 --> 19:54.410
The developers placed trackers
inside them as a precaution.

19:54.454 --> 19:56.717
As soon as we landed
in L.A., we were able

19:56.760 --> 19:58.501
to activate them remotely.

19:58.545 --> 19:59.937
This is where they brought us.

19:59.981 --> 20:01.939
Problem is,

20:01.983 --> 20:03.854
the signal died
before we arrived.

20:03.898 --> 20:05.247
We were too late.

20:05.291 --> 20:06.857
Can you still get a read
off the trackers?
No.

20:06.901 --> 20:09.556
Whoever has the weapons
must have disabled them.

20:09.599 --> 20:11.514
You got any idea who might be
behind something like this?

20:11.558 --> 20:14.952
No, but what you said
about the launchers is true.

20:14.996 --> 20:18.956
They're dangerous, and
even more so in the wrong hands.

20:19.000 --> 20:22.743
The trackers were our
last chance at finding them.

20:34.494 --> 20:36.017
That about Agent Lyons?

20:36.060 --> 20:38.672
No. Her husband texted earlier,
said she's still in surgery.

20:38.715 --> 20:40.500
That was Bonnie.

20:40.543 --> 20:41.849
She keeps telling me
she's fine, but...

20:41.892 --> 20:43.459
But you're
still worried.

20:43.503 --> 20:46.070
You know, she's probably
feeling the same way about you.

20:46.114 --> 20:48.595
Maybe you should
take some time off.

20:48.638 --> 20:50.553
Deacon's on
a family vacation.

20:50.597 --> 20:52.642
You should look after
your family, too.

20:52.686 --> 20:55.471
I'm sure Hondo and
the commander would... I'm fine.

20:55.515 --> 20:56.907
It's nothing
I can't push through.

20:56.951 --> 20:58.474
Anything turn up on the security footage

20:58.518 --> 20:59.736
from outside the warehouse?

20:59.780 --> 21:01.390
The Israelis told us
the trackers went dark

21:01.434 --> 21:02.957
around 1330 hours,
which helped me

21:03.000 --> 21:05.046
narrow down the time frame
with the surveillance footage.

21:05.089 --> 21:06.526
An SUV left

21:06.569 --> 21:08.658
the site about half-hour
after the trackers died.

21:08.702 --> 21:11.052
Couldn't grab the plates.

21:11.095 --> 21:13.446
You see this decal
on the windshield?

21:13.489 --> 21:14.925
It's a parking
gate pass,

21:14.969 --> 21:16.971
about a dozen businesses
use the garage.

21:17.014 --> 21:18.668
What kind
of businesses?

21:18.712 --> 21:20.975
That's what I'm looking at.
Some production companies,

21:21.018 --> 21:22.629
catering group,

21:22.672 --> 21:24.108
something here with
conspicuous lack of information

21:24.152 --> 21:25.675
called the
Eris Group.

21:25.719 --> 21:27.590
Eris is a private,
upstart military contractor

21:27.634 --> 21:29.897
focused on developing
the latest weapons.

21:29.940 --> 21:31.072
Think they'd actually
lift foreign arms

21:31.115 --> 21:32.508
and have them smuggled
here illegally?

21:32.552 --> 21:34.031
Given the circumstances,
can't rule it out.

21:34.075 --> 21:36.164
If the Israeli weapons
have superior tech...

21:36.207 --> 21:37.992
Steal the weapon
and copy it.

21:38.035 --> 21:39.863
A lot easier than
developing one on their own.

21:39.907 --> 21:41.038
Can DHS get us
a warrant?

21:41.082 --> 21:43.214
I'll see
what I can do.

21:47.044 --> 21:49.525
So, this is how
the other side lives?

21:49.569 --> 21:51.614
Thanks. I'll
take it from here.

21:51.658 --> 21:53.050
All right.

21:53.094 --> 21:55.096
Appreciate you
coming in.

21:55.139 --> 21:57.011
I wanted to talk to you
about this morning.

21:57.054 --> 21:59.622
About Dave?
You hear anything?

21:59.666 --> 22:02.451
It's actually about what
we can do for folks like Dave.

22:02.495 --> 22:03.931
Oh, really?
Is that what you thinking?

22:03.974 --> 22:05.541
'Cause this morning,

22:05.585 --> 22:07.848
sounded like you were telling me
to stay in my lane,

22:07.891 --> 22:09.458
"Let the cops
do their job."

22:09.502 --> 22:13.070
Leroy. I am hoping to launch
a program with the LAPD.

22:13.114 --> 22:15.943
Train volunteers to respond
to nonviolent calls.

22:15.986 --> 22:18.467
And I want you
to be a part of it.

22:18.511 --> 22:20.077
Look, man, we both know
it doesn't take much

22:20.121 --> 22:22.166
for things to escalate
when the cops show up,

22:22.210 --> 22:23.951
even when they're
called to be there.

22:23.994 --> 22:25.648
Just their presence
can feel like a threat

22:25.692 --> 22:27.084
to someone like Dave.

22:27.128 --> 22:28.695
- So? What do you need me for?
- I've seen how you are

22:28.738 --> 22:30.914
under pressure. You know how
to defuse a situation.

22:30.958 --> 22:32.089
You know how to keep your cool,

22:32.133 --> 22:33.917
especially when
somebody's trying

22:33.961 --> 22:36.093
to get a reaction out of you.
I want you to join the program,

22:36.137 --> 22:39.488
help train, even.
What you think?

22:39.532 --> 22:42.448
Yeah, I got
no damn reason to help LAPD.

22:42.491 --> 22:44.754
Prefer they just leave me
the hell alone.

22:44.798 --> 22:48.584
Leroy, you put yourself between
Dave and those cops. Why?

22:48.628 --> 22:51.805
How's it gonna look, things
go sideways in front of my shop?

22:51.848 --> 22:53.459
Was purely a business decision.

22:53.502 --> 22:54.982
You and me may have
gone down different paths,

22:55.025 --> 22:57.898
man, but we still want
some of the same things.

22:57.941 --> 22:59.378
We keep an eye out
for our people,

22:59.421 --> 23:01.031
and we show up
for the community

23:01.075 --> 23:03.251
because we care. That's why
you stepped in for Dave.

23:03.294 --> 23:05.862
Look, if this
program works,

23:05.906 --> 23:08.299
there could be a case for less
LAPD patrols in the area.

23:08.343 --> 23:09.431
Isn't that something
you want to see?

23:09.475 --> 23:11.781
I-I ain't buying this, man.

23:11.825 --> 23:14.697
I mean, thinking that
this program's

23:14.741 --> 23:18.440
all it's gonna take for LAPD to
look like they're making change

23:18.484 --> 23:19.572
in South L.A.?

23:19.615 --> 23:21.443
Yeah, I hear you,
and you're right.

23:21.487 --> 23:23.793
This ain't gonna solve
everything, or most stuff,

23:23.837 --> 23:26.274
but, Leroy, it's a step
to some real change, and that's

23:26.317 --> 23:27.797
worth it to me.

23:27.841 --> 23:29.190
What else am I
gonna do, hmm?

23:29.233 --> 23:32.149
Just sit back
and do nothing?

23:38.025 --> 23:39.243
I got to make a move.

23:39.287 --> 23:41.115
Look, I appreciate you
coming out.

23:41.158 --> 23:44.423
I just thought this might be
something was worth your while.

23:44.466 --> 23:48.252
Just... think about it,
all right?

23:56.522 --> 23:58.175
I'm Byron Hughes, Eris CEO.

23:58.219 --> 24:00.177
Someone want to tell me
what the hell is going on here?

24:00.221 --> 24:01.657
Agent Gunther,
Homeland Security.

24:01.701 --> 24:03.833
I have a federal warrant
to search the premises.

24:03.877 --> 24:05.748
Just what exactly
are you hoping to find?

24:05.792 --> 24:07.794
There's highly sensitive
projects being developed here.

24:07.837 --> 24:10.361
I can't have you just running
roughshod wherever you please.

24:10.405 --> 24:11.885
I'm afraid you don't have
a choice, Mr. Hughes.

24:11.928 --> 24:14.844
We do a lot of work
with the U.S. government.

24:14.888 --> 24:15.932
We're not the enemy.

24:15.976 --> 24:17.151
Maybe I can help.

24:17.194 --> 24:19.196
I'm Sergeant Harrelson,
LAPD SWAT.

24:19.240 --> 24:21.024
We're looking into
stolen Israeli weapons

24:21.068 --> 24:22.156
smuggled into L.A. from Haifa.

24:22.199 --> 24:24.114
Any of that
ring a bell?

24:24.158 --> 24:25.768
I'm not sure
what you've heard, Sergeant,

24:25.812 --> 24:27.857
but we build
our own weapons at Eris.

24:27.901 --> 24:29.337
I'm proud to say the products
we develop here

24:29.380 --> 24:31.861
protect our country,
both at home and abroad.

24:31.905 --> 24:33.341
You ever seen
this before?

24:35.735 --> 24:37.693
Could be
a coincidence, but...

24:37.737 --> 24:39.086
we're developing
something similar.

24:39.129 --> 24:40.696
It's nowhere near
completion yet, though.

24:40.740 --> 24:42.089
And your company would never stoop

24:42.132 --> 24:43.220
to stealing foreign arms tech

24:43.264 --> 24:44.744
to help your project move along?

24:47.268 --> 24:51.141
Look, we're in
a competitive business.

24:51.185 --> 24:53.230
Everybody borrows from somebody.

24:53.274 --> 24:55.232
You know how often
weapons tech is stolen,

24:55.276 --> 24:56.843
copied, or remade
in this industry?

24:56.886 --> 25:00.324
It's the only way
to keep up, keep an edge.

25:00.368 --> 25:03.240
That's not to say I personally
know anything about any theft.

25:03.284 --> 25:05.895
I, uh, don't concern myself

25:05.939 --> 25:07.288
with the
day-to-day details.

25:07.331 --> 25:08.942
That's a convenient way
to keep your hands clean.

25:08.985 --> 25:10.813
Who does deal with the details?

25:10.857 --> 25:12.119
That'd be the lead engineer,
Chip Webb.

25:12.162 --> 25:14.034
And where do we find
Mr. Webb?

25:14.077 --> 25:16.297
I'll have him
come join us.

25:21.955 --> 25:23.391
Is there a problem?

25:23.434 --> 25:25.088
He should be in his office or the lab,

25:25.132 --> 25:28.091
but... this says he logged out
ten minutes ago.

25:28.135 --> 25:30.920
Do you have cameras
in the parking lot?

25:36.491 --> 25:38.885
Stop it right there.

25:38.928 --> 25:40.408
Is that Mr. Webb?

25:40.451 --> 25:42.497
Luca, get a BOLO out
- on that truck.
- On it, boss.

25:42.541 --> 25:45.326
Any reason you can think of
that he would want this weapon?

25:48.242 --> 25:49.722
Talk to me, Street.

25:49.765 --> 25:51.245
Nothing from the BOLO
on the SUV,

25:51.288 --> 25:53.290
and patrol didn't find
anything at his place.

25:53.334 --> 25:54.465
Hondo said
they recovered

25:54.509 --> 25:56.206
one of the Israeli weapons
back at Eris,

25:56.250 --> 25:58.165
but this clown's
still got the last one,

25:58.208 --> 26:00.776
and that's enough. Who the hell
is Chip Webb, anyway?

26:00.820 --> 26:01.777
He's nobody.

26:01.821 --> 26:03.474
"Chip Webb"
is a fake identity

26:03.518 --> 26:04.954
this guy built
in order to get past

26:04.998 --> 26:06.782
Eris's flimsy background check.

26:06.826 --> 26:08.218
His real name is Jason Wells.

26:08.262 --> 26:10.090
Six years ago, he attended

26:10.133 --> 26:11.657
an engineering conference
in Manila.

26:11.700 --> 26:13.354
His tour bus was ambushed
by a terrorist cell

26:13.397 --> 26:15.748
called Abu Sibi,
and he was taken prisoner.

26:15.791 --> 26:16.792
I've heard of Abu Sibi.

26:16.836 --> 26:18.751
Big on for-profit
kidnapping.

26:18.794 --> 26:20.840
So how did Wells get out?
Family pay the ransom?

26:20.883 --> 26:22.102
Family didn't have the means,

26:22.145 --> 26:23.799
so they appealed
to the U.S. government...

26:23.843 --> 26:26.236
But the U.S. government doesn't
negotiate with terrorists.

26:26.280 --> 26:27.673
Not officially,anyway.

26:27.716 --> 26:29.457
But, nonetheless,
six months after he was taken,

26:29.500 --> 26:32.155
Jason turns up at a Red Cross
outpost in Quezon City.

26:32.199 --> 26:35.724
Told aid workers that
Abu Sibi just let him walk out.

26:35.768 --> 26:37.378
Now, take a look at his
social media.

26:37.421 --> 26:41.251
Posts are a call to arms against
the greed of the Western world

26:41.295 --> 26:43.253
and the need to fight
against American corruption.

26:43.297 --> 26:46.169
Echoing Abu Sibi's
ideology.
Look,

26:46.213 --> 26:47.997
guy has no
immediate family,

26:48.041 --> 26:49.129
his mother died
when he was young,

26:49.172 --> 26:50.260
no record of his birth father.

26:50.304 --> 26:51.827
Lonely kid
turned hostage?

26:51.871 --> 26:52.828
Would've made him
more susceptible

26:52.872 --> 26:54.395
to Abu Sibi's
teachings.

26:54.438 --> 26:55.788
They must've
recruited him.

26:55.831 --> 26:57.746
Now he has a weapon
capable of who knows what,

26:57.790 --> 26:59.400
and we have no idea
how he's planning to use it.

26:59.443 --> 27:00.662
Well, he knows
we're onto him,

27:00.706 --> 27:02.664
which means he's likely
to accelerate his plan.

27:02.708 --> 27:04.057
And if he's working
with Abu Sibi,

27:04.100 --> 27:05.145
whatever he does
will be big.

27:05.188 --> 27:06.450
Designed to send
a message.

27:06.494 --> 27:08.496
Street, see if Agent Gunther
can give us any info

27:08.539 --> 27:10.541
on active Abu Sibi members
on their watchlist.

27:10.585 --> 27:12.239
It could help us to know
if Jason's working alone,

27:12.282 --> 27:14.720
- or if he's got accomplices.
- Okay.

27:33.129 --> 27:35.305
Let's go, let's go.

27:37.220 --> 27:39.222
Hey, you guys can't
read or what?

27:39.266 --> 27:42.182
This place is zoned
as off-limits.

27:42.225 --> 27:44.445
How'd you even get past
all the...

28:03.116 --> 28:05.945
A DHS analysis of Jason Wells'
recent communication

28:05.988 --> 28:07.381
indicates that he's been
in contact with

28:07.424 --> 28:09.383
these five Abu Sibi
accomplices.

28:09.426 --> 28:10.514
Three of them are
from out of state,

28:10.558 --> 28:11.864
the other two are local.

28:11.907 --> 28:13.387
We sent unis over
to their addresses;

28:13.430 --> 28:14.910
both places were stripped.

28:14.954 --> 28:17.043
Not so much as a calendar
on the wall.

28:17.086 --> 28:18.522
Probably on their way
to link up with Jason

28:18.566 --> 28:20.350
- or with him now.
- The I.T. brains at Eris Group

28:20.394 --> 28:21.569
did a search
of Jason's computer.

28:21.612 --> 28:23.310
I think they found a lead
on his target.

28:23.353 --> 28:25.181
Right before he ran out
of Eris,

28:25.225 --> 28:26.313
he was working
to modify the gun's

28:26.356 --> 28:27.836
tracking and targeting system.

28:27.880 --> 28:29.359
- Modify it how?
- He was programming it

28:29.403 --> 28:31.100
to lock onto
the transponder frequencies

28:31.144 --> 28:32.493
used by commercial airliners.

28:32.536 --> 28:33.929
He's gonna shoot
down a plane.

28:33.973 --> 28:36.410
How soon can DHS ground
all commercial flights

28:36.453 --> 28:38.064
into and out of
Southern California?

28:38.107 --> 28:39.500
I'll put out the call now.

28:39.543 --> 28:41.937
Jason Wells barely made it
out of Eris when we arrived.

28:41.981 --> 28:43.243
He's gonna try and
use that weapon now,

28:43.286 --> 28:44.548
while he still can.

28:44.592 --> 28:46.072
Is there any way of
tracking the gun itself?

28:46.115 --> 28:47.856
The manufacturer equipped it
with a tracking device,

28:47.900 --> 28:50.076
but it was disabled before
the guns left the warehouse.

28:50.119 --> 28:51.512
There still might be a way.

28:51.555 --> 28:53.079
The weapon's own targeting
system emits a high-end

28:53.122 --> 28:55.081
EMF signal, but not until
it's activated.

28:55.124 --> 28:57.213
So by the time we're able to
pinpoint its location...

28:57.257 --> 28:58.867
It may already be
too late.

28:58.911 --> 29:01.087
ATC is working on grounding
and diverting all flights,

29:01.130 --> 29:03.480
but there's an A380
inbound to LAX.

29:03.524 --> 29:05.395
It's low on fuel
and needs to land soon.

29:05.439 --> 29:07.093
A380s are massive.

29:07.136 --> 29:08.398
Board over 800 passengers.

29:08.442 --> 29:09.922
- Can't they divert it?
- Afraid not.

29:09.965 --> 29:12.576
LAX is the only runway
big enough to handle an A380.

29:12.620 --> 29:14.187
Like it or not,
she's coming in.

29:14.230 --> 29:15.928
Clock's ticking. You need to get over to LAX.

29:15.971 --> 29:18.147
I'll see what I can do
about getting air support

29:18.191 --> 29:19.366
to direct the search.

29:21.847 --> 29:23.239
Five minutes out.20-David to Command.

29:23.283 --> 29:24.937
We're nearing the airport.

29:24.980 --> 29:26.112
What do you got for us?

29:26.155 --> 29:27.548
No luck in getting
air support.

29:27.591 --> 29:30.856
Everything above LAX is
still restricted airspace.

29:30.899 --> 29:33.206
But the good news is
we haven't picked up

29:33.249 --> 29:35.121
any unusual EMF
in the area.

29:35.164 --> 29:37.123
What about our inbound plane?

29:37.166 --> 29:39.952
ATC has the flight on approach
to runway two-five-right.

29:39.995 --> 29:42.432
That's gonna put it
over a corridor

29:42.476 --> 29:44.957
just south of Century Boulevard,
running from Westmont

29:45.000 --> 29:46.001
to the Lennox area.

29:46.045 --> 29:47.263
Okay, there's an office park

29:47.307 --> 29:49.048
just east of Grand
and Center Street.

29:49.091 --> 29:51.137
A couple of the buildings there
are scheduled for demolition.

29:51.180 --> 29:53.879
The plane will fly
right over them.

29:53.922 --> 29:55.663
Luca, get us to Grand
and Center Street.

29:55.706 --> 29:56.838
Okay, roger that.

30:10.591 --> 30:12.549
Street, check our man down.

30:14.508 --> 30:16.118
No pulse.

30:17.163 --> 30:19.382
Hondo, it looks like
Jason's car.

30:19.426 --> 30:22.472
Hondo, the gun's EMF signal
just lit up

30:22.516 --> 30:23.909
right on top of you.

30:23.952 --> 30:25.736
You're in the right place,
but you've got to move.

30:25.780 --> 30:27.477
Flight's six minutes out.

30:27.521 --> 30:29.044
Roger that, Commander.
Making entry now.

30:29.088 --> 30:30.611
The building has two stairwell
access routes to the roof.

30:30.654 --> 30:32.831
North and south entrances.
Building plans list

30:32.874 --> 30:34.441
a service entry from the south.

30:34.484 --> 30:36.095
All right, Chris, Street,
Luca, find the north stairs.

30:36.138 --> 30:37.879
Tan, we'll take
the service entrance.

30:37.923 --> 30:40.795
This plane's gonna land any
minute; let's get to the roof.

31:33.804 --> 31:34.805
24-David.

31:34.849 --> 31:36.068
One suspect in custody.

31:36.111 --> 31:39.114
Making our way up
the north side stairs.

31:52.736 --> 31:54.477
Anything?

31:57.002 --> 32:00.048
There. Just coming into view.

32:04.183 --> 32:06.663
26-David, ready
at the north landing, Hondo.

32:06.707 --> 32:07.751
Roger.

32:07.795 --> 32:09.666
In position at the south entry.

32:09.710 --> 32:12.017
Prepare to breach on my call.

32:12.060 --> 32:14.019
Three, two...

32:14.062 --> 32:15.977
- one, go.
- Go.

32:24.899 --> 32:26.814
24-David. No eyes

32:26.857 --> 32:28.772
on Jason yet.

32:30.992 --> 32:33.125
Soon! Almost in range.

32:50.577 --> 32:52.448
Tan, cover me.

32:57.758 --> 33:00.848
Don't move. Put it down now!

33:00.891 --> 33:03.894
Hands behind your back.
On your knees!

33:03.938 --> 33:06.897
- Thanks, Chris.
- Always got your back.

33:08.812 --> 33:10.031
Third suspect in custody.

33:10.075 --> 33:12.120
We got Jason
and two more to go.

33:12.164 --> 33:13.904
Anyone got eyes?

33:15.776 --> 33:17.821
Cover!
Get down!

33:36.188 --> 33:37.319
Is everybody good?

33:37.363 --> 33:39.365
I'm good.

33:42.324 --> 33:44.109
Southwest corner!

33:44.152 --> 33:46.328
- He's gonna get the shot.
- That can't happen.

33:46.372 --> 33:48.417
Cover me.
Everything you got.

34:16.576 --> 34:18.143
Don't move!
Don't move!

34:18.186 --> 34:21.233
This is 20-David to Command.
The weapon is secure.

34:21.276 --> 34:23.931
All suspects are down
or in custody. We're Code 4.

34:30.633 --> 34:34.202
Hondo, flight made it in safe.
About to touch down.

34:34.246 --> 34:35.290
Good work.

34:37.205 --> 34:40.078
It was a pleasure working
- with you, Agent Gunther.
- Likewise.

34:40.121 --> 34:41.905
I'll talk to my people
at DoD.

34:41.949 --> 34:44.473
Get them to reconsider
the defense contracts

34:44.517 --> 34:46.997
they have with Eris.

34:49.913 --> 34:51.611
Nice job today, guys.
See you tomorrow

34:51.654 --> 34:52.960
so we can do it
all over again?

34:53.003 --> 34:54.918
Hopefully not all of it.

34:54.962 --> 34:56.181
Have a good night, guys.

34:58.357 --> 35:00.533
Hey, good news.

35:00.576 --> 35:02.143
I called the hospital.

35:02.187 --> 35:03.492
Agent Lyons came through
her surgery,

35:03.536 --> 35:06.321
and doctors say she's gonna
be okay; the baby, too.

35:06.365 --> 35:08.889
That's great. I'm glad.

35:08.932 --> 35:10.978
What about you?

35:11.021 --> 35:13.111
Are you gonna be okay?

35:20.422 --> 35:23.121
I picked this up the night
Bonnie told me she was pregnant.

35:23.991 --> 35:26.559
I knew it was too early
to be buying stuff, but...

35:26.602 --> 35:29.170
You were excited
to be a dad.

35:29.214 --> 35:31.041
Yeah.

35:31.085 --> 35:34.436
We weren't planning
to have kids yet, but

35:34.480 --> 35:37.178
the second I heard,
in my head I'm thinking

35:37.222 --> 35:40.921
about names, signing
up for soccer,

35:40.964 --> 35:43.228
wondering about schools.

35:43.271 --> 35:45.926
I was so stupid,
I probably jinxed myself

35:45.969 --> 35:49.147
- getting my hopes up.
- No. You did nothing wrong.

35:49.190 --> 35:50.583
And what happened
isn't something

35:50.626 --> 35:52.846
you could have fixed
or prevented.

35:54.804 --> 35:57.024
When Erica died,
I thought about

35:57.067 --> 35:59.766
a million and one reasons
why I was responsible.

35:59.809 --> 36:02.072
So how'd you get past it?

36:02.116 --> 36:05.554
Well, it wasn't just one thing.

36:05.598 --> 36:07.643
You got me into
boxing therapy.

36:07.687 --> 36:10.603
Street urged me
to go to A.A.

36:10.646 --> 36:12.605
But what really
got me out of it was

36:12.648 --> 36:14.520
having everyone there
beside me.

36:14.563 --> 36:16.870
The way I'm gonna be there
with you through this.

36:16.913 --> 36:19.177
And the way you're gonna
be there for Bonnie.

36:28.534 --> 36:30.579
Hey, guys.
Thanks for coming on by.

36:30.623 --> 36:32.146
- Why don't you come on in?
- Actually, your timing was great.

36:32.190 --> 36:34.496
Kelly realized she left
her notebook here this morning.

36:34.540 --> 36:36.019
Oh. Why don't you
go look for it

36:36.063 --> 36:37.586
- while I talk to your mom.
- Okay.

36:38.283 --> 36:40.720
So, what'd you want
to talk about?

36:40.763 --> 36:43.418
Well, first I want to
say thank you

36:43.462 --> 36:44.637
for the invitation.

36:44.680 --> 36:47.074
I think you are
an amazing woman

36:47.117 --> 36:49.250
and incredible mom,

36:49.294 --> 36:53.515
and anyone would be lucky
to be with you.

36:53.559 --> 36:55.474
Just... I'm just not looking for

36:55.517 --> 36:57.867
a romantic relationship
right now.

36:57.911 --> 36:59.869
Wait, what invitation?

36:59.913 --> 37:02.742
The text you sent me about
catching waves at Redondo,

37:02.785 --> 37:06.006
and then grabbing a bite to eat
at Katie's Grill after.

37:06.049 --> 37:07.834
Just the two of us.
This one?

37:07.877 --> 37:10.793
I didn't send that text.

37:12.665 --> 37:15.885
Wait, my entire message thread
with you is gone.

37:15.929 --> 37:17.844
It's been deleted.

37:17.887 --> 37:19.802
I found it.

37:21.151 --> 37:22.196
Oh, my God.

37:22.240 --> 37:23.589
I'm so sorry.

37:23.632 --> 37:25.155
I'll talk to Kelly
when we get home.

37:25.199 --> 37:27.767
- This is so embarrassing.
- No, don't even worry about it.

37:27.810 --> 37:29.421
In fact, you know,
maybe we should

37:29.464 --> 37:30.770
talk to Kelly about it
together.

37:30.813 --> 37:32.337
What's wrong?

37:32.380 --> 37:35.078
Is there something you want to
tell me and your mom, um,

37:35.122 --> 37:36.776
about the text?

37:37.951 --> 37:39.561
No.

37:39.605 --> 37:40.693
I got a text

37:40.736 --> 37:42.825
from your mom today
asking me on a date.

37:43.565 --> 37:47.134
Oh, are-are you asking
if that'd be weird?

37:47.177 --> 37:49.179
Because I'd be okay with that.

37:49.223 --> 37:51.617
I didn't send Luca
that text.

37:51.660 --> 37:54.097
We're both pretty sure
you sent it.

37:55.838 --> 37:57.057
Talk to me.

37:57.100 --> 37:58.580
That's not like you
going through

37:58.624 --> 38:01.496
your mom's phone,
and lying to me.

38:02.671 --> 38:04.020
What's going on?

38:04.064 --> 38:08.982
Okay. I thought if you two
spent time together

38:09.025 --> 38:11.767
you'd see he should be
a part of our family.

38:12.464 --> 38:14.988
You're the two best people
I know.

38:15.031 --> 38:17.469
Luca is a great friend.

38:17.512 --> 38:19.819
He <i>is</i> like family.

38:19.862 --> 38:21.821
Yeah, but what if one day

38:21.864 --> 38:23.823
you meet somebody

38:23.866 --> 38:26.565
and you start your own family?

38:26.608 --> 38:29.611
You'll just forget about me.

38:29.655 --> 38:31.657
Hey, I worry about it, too.

38:31.700 --> 38:35.182
Except I worry one day
you're gonna outgrow me.

38:35.225 --> 38:36.923
You won't need me anymore.

38:36.966 --> 38:40.405
You'll have some boyfriend
or some other interest,

38:40.448 --> 38:43.973
and dropping by here won't
sound so appealing anymore.

38:44.017 --> 38:47.455
Your mom and I...

38:47.499 --> 38:50.502
we're not gonna date
each other like that.

38:50.545 --> 38:52.634
But I promise you

38:52.678 --> 38:55.811
I'll always be there
for you and your mom.

38:56.725 --> 38:58.074
Okay? No matter what.

38:58.118 --> 39:00.599
'Cause that's what families
do for each other.

39:01.687 --> 39:03.906
And we're family, right?

39:09.216 --> 39:12.132
I really put myself out there
with the brass

39:12.175 --> 39:14.047
to make this
happen, so...

39:14.090 --> 39:15.744
I hope you know
what you're doing.

39:15.788 --> 39:17.746
It's not gonna change
everything, sir.

39:17.790 --> 39:20.749
But I do believe it will
change some things.

39:20.793 --> 39:23.448
And right now, that's
as good as anything.

39:23.491 --> 39:26.015
Well, we should
get started soon.

39:26.059 --> 39:27.103
Is Leroy coming?

39:27.147 --> 39:28.496
He never promised to show.

39:28.540 --> 39:30.455
I just extended the offer.

39:30.498 --> 39:31.934
He's got his reasons.

39:31.978 --> 39:34.894
There's a part of me that
gets where he's coming from.

39:34.937 --> 39:36.591
All right.

39:37.418 --> 39:38.724
I want to thank you all
for coming.

39:38.767 --> 39:40.726
Would you mind having a seat?

39:40.769 --> 39:42.902
I'm Sergeant Daniel Harrelson.

39:42.945 --> 39:44.643
Now, if you're here,
you've probably heard about

39:44.686 --> 39:46.427
the community policing
initiative

39:46.471 --> 39:48.516
that we're starting here
in South L.A.

39:48.560 --> 39:50.953
Or maybe you're just here
to have some lukewarm coffee.

39:53.303 --> 39:56.045
I grew up in this neighborhood.

39:56.089 --> 39:58.221
It's my home.

39:58.265 --> 40:00.049
So I know the history
of this community

40:00.093 --> 40:01.181
and what it's gone through.

40:01.224 --> 40:03.488
And like many of you,

40:03.531 --> 40:06.055
I've lost faith
a couple of times

40:06.099 --> 40:10.756
in the empty promises
for change and justice.

40:10.799 --> 40:12.714
I thought that
doing the right thing meant

40:12.758 --> 40:16.718
waiting on the system to deliver
the kind of change that I want.

40:20.722 --> 40:22.855
But if I've learned anything
over the past year,

40:22.898 --> 40:25.205
it's realizing that
the change that we want

40:25.248 --> 40:27.773
in our communities,
in our neighborhoods

40:27.816 --> 40:30.123
is on each and every one of us.

40:30.166 --> 40:34.170
Because it won't happen
unless we make it happen.

40:36.259 --> 40:39.480
Yeah, so-so what you're saying

40:39.524 --> 40:42.962
sort of sounds like
the community

40:43.005 --> 40:46.052
would be doing what the police <i>
should</i> be doing.

40:46.095 --> 40:49.969
Now, maybe some of us
don't want to help the LAPD

40:50.012 --> 40:53.015
do the jobs they're already
being paid enough to do.

40:53.625 --> 40:56.584
You're not here
to help the police.

40:56.628 --> 40:59.500
You're here to help the people.

41:03.548 --> 41:04.505
So let's get started.

41:19.999 --> 41:22.001
