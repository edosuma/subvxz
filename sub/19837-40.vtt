00:03.730 --> 00:07.720
<b>There are six distinct categories of <i>Nen</i> users.</b>

00:08.770 --> 00:10.110
<b>Enhancer.</b>

00:10.110 --> 00:15.030
<b>Enhancers are able to strengthen 
various objects' effectiveness.</b>

00:15.780 --> 00:16.960
<b>Transmuter.</b>

00:16.960 --> 00:20.740
<b>Transmuters can use their aura 
to alter objects' qualities.</b>

00:21.830 --> 00:23.220
<b>Conjurer.</b>

00:23.220 --> 00:27.840
<b>Somewhat akin to Transmuters, 
Conjurers are able to manifest their aura.</b>

00:28.810 --> 00:30.140
<b>Emitter.</b>

00:30.140 --> 00:33.460
<b>Emitters can propel their 
aura like projectiles.</b>

00:34.470 --> 00:35.860
<b>Manipulator.</b>

00:35.860 --> 00:39.440
<b>Manipulators can use their auras to 
control objects and creatures.</b>

00:40.290 --> 00:41.750
<b>Specialist.</b>

00:41.750 --> 00:45.690
<b>Specialists are those with rare abilities 
that don't fit in the other five classes.</b>

00:46.800 --> 00:49.720
<b>Begin by determining which 
category your aura falls within.</b>

00:49.720 --> 00:55.030
<b>That is the first step to 
becoming a skilled <i>Nen</i> user.</b>

02:16.080 --> 02:19.830
<b>There's one month before the auction begins.</b>

02:19.830 --> 02:23.600
<b>Before then, you must find one item 
from the list we will provide,</b>

02:23.600 --> 02:26.040
<b>and bring it here.</b>

02:32.970 --> 02:36.560
<b>If you are successful, you will be hired,</b>

02:36.560 --> 02:39.020
<b>and begin training as a 
bodyguard and a collector.</b>

02:39.980 --> 02:44.270
<b><i>The man talking was, most likely, 
not the actual employer.</i></b>

02:44.690 --> 02:47.990
<b><i>That only illustrates the distance 
between the boss and me...</i></b>

02:49.230 --> 02:52.290
<b><i>I shall reduce that distance to zero,</i></b>

02:52.290 --> 02:56.590
<b><i>until the employer feels that he 
can trust me with his secrets...</i></b>

02:58.020 --> 02:59.860
<b><i>I will pass this test.</i></b>

03:00.250 --> 03:04.070
<b><i>First I need to curry their favor, 
and win their trust.</i></b>

03:04.070 --> 03:09.080
<b>Nen x Users x Unite?</b>

03:09.500 --> 03:11.410
<b>Hmm? The door won't open.</b>

03:13.100 --> 03:14.840
<b>I forgot to mention one thing.</b>

03:15.380 --> 03:18.430
<b>The barest minimum requirement 
is that you be strong...</b>

03:19.430 --> 03:23.990
<b>Strong enough to leave this mansion alive.</b>

03:43.840 --> 03:45.070
<b>Dowsing Chain 
The Guiding Ring Finger Chain</b>

04:12.600 --> 04:14.020
<b><i>That's impressive.</i></b>

04:14.020 --> 04:15.940
<b><i>He used a chain to catch the bullets?</i></b>

04:31.200 --> 04:32.540
<b><i>Three with guns.</i></b>

04:33.440 --> 04:34.480
<b><i>Six with swords.</i></b>

04:39.360 --> 04:41.300
<b><i>Two more with swords above.</i></b>

04:44.620 --> 04:47.030
<b>You guys did a good job 
of concealing your presences,</b>

04:47.030 --> 04:49.350
<b>but you're too weak.</b>

04:51.420 --> 04:54.930
<b>I don't even need to use my <i>Nen</i>...</b>

04:58.820 --> 05:00.360
<b><i>Now I understand.</i></b>

05:00.360 --> 05:02.650
<b><i>So that's what's going on.</i></b>

05:15.980 --> 05:16.670
<b><i>He's the one.</i></b>

05:24.040 --> 05:25.200
<b>Stop them.</b>

05:26.180 --> 05:27.530
<b>I'll give you three seconds.</b>

05:28.020 --> 05:29.040
<b>One...</b>

05:29.040 --> 05:29.680
<b>Two...</b>

05:29.680 --> 05:31.290
<b>Okay.</b>

05:31.760 --> 05:33.310
<b>I get it.</b>

05:38.410 --> 05:40.080
<b>Wh-What's going on?</b>

05:40.600 --> 05:42.440
<b>They really were made from <i>Nen</i>.</b>

05:42.720 --> 05:45.150
<b>I could tell when I landed a punch,</b>

05:45.150 --> 05:48.440
<b>that I was hitting aura shaped like a human...</b>

05:48.880 --> 05:49.530
<b>However,</b>

05:49.530 --> 05:52.170
<b>I didn't realize it was his <i>Nen</i>.</b>

05:52.170 --> 05:54.310
<b>How did you know?</b>

05:54.310 --> 05:57.580
<b>You were always careful to stand 
next to others for camouflage.</b>

05:57.580 --> 06:00.290
<b>But when I observed from above, 
everything was clear.</b>

06:01.170 --> 06:04.420
<b>You were the only person not under attack.</b>

06:07.840 --> 06:09.960
<b>I realized something was wrong</b>

06:09.960 --> 06:12.430
<b>when assailants appeared on the second floor.</b>

06:12.800 --> 06:16.100
<b>After I jumped on the chandelier,</b>

06:16.100 --> 06:18.590
<b>they just stood there, swords swinging</b>

06:18.590 --> 06:21.730
<b>in a futile attempt to reach me.</b>

06:22.910 --> 06:25.280
<b>I assume they received the following order:</b>

06:25.930 --> 06:28.480
<b>Attack the nearest enemy.</b>

06:29.380 --> 06:31.870
<b>The assailants were given 
simple instructions,</b>

06:32.070 --> 06:33.740
<b>so their attacks were also simple.</b>

06:34.280 --> 06:37.120
<b>However, it would take a skilled <i>Nen</i> user</b>

06:37.120 --> 06:41.420
<b>to control eleven human-sized 
auras simultaneously.</b>

06:42.920 --> 06:47.210
<b>A <i>Nen</i> user who would most 
likely be a Manipulator.</b>

06:47.750 --> 06:49.900
<b>Given the size of auras involved,</b>

06:49.900 --> 06:52.720
<b>the Manipulator had to be 
within a few meters.</b>

06:53.460 --> 06:55.430
<b>Which meant that the <i>Nen</i> user</b>

06:56.380 --> 06:58.930
<b>was inside this room.</b>

07:02.400 --> 07:03.440
<b>You nailed it.</b>

07:04.440 --> 07:06.840
<b>My name is Shachmono Tocino.</b>

07:07.360 --> 07:09.620
<b>I'm actually a Hunter.</b>

07:09.620 --> 07:11.890
<b>I work for the boss here,</b>

07:11.890 --> 07:14.740
<b>so I will have seniority over you.</b>

07:14.740 --> 07:17.610
<b>Now that everything's clear, 
could you drop the knife?</b>

07:25.870 --> 07:30.840
<b>Judging by those chains, 
you must be a Manipulator...</b>

07:32.540 --> 07:35.120
<b>Well, I hope you won't hold a grudge.</b>

07:35.120 --> 07:37.940
<b>I was just following orders from the boss.</b>

07:38.290 --> 07:40.710
<b>"Test them by trying to kill them."</b>

07:41.120 --> 07:44.480
<b>But I never expected you to 
pick up on me so fast.</b>

07:45.050 --> 07:47.500
<b>Well, the four of you together</b>

07:47.500 --> 07:49.680
<b>should be able to escape this mansion.</b>

07:49.680 --> 07:50.860
<b>Good luck.</b>

07:51.210 --> 07:52.360
<b>Four?</b>

07:53.260 --> 07:56.300
<b>Is there another plant in the room?</b>

08:01.450 --> 08:03.620
<b>I'll assume that was meant as a diversion.</b>

08:03.620 --> 08:05.500
<b>But either way, it was a mistake.</b>

08:06.340 --> 08:09.170
<b>I shall determine if there 
are any other plants,</b>

08:09.170 --> 08:13.180
<b>before we all start becoming paranoid.</b>

08:55.370 --> 08:56.430
<b>There.</b>

08:59.690 --> 09:01.460
<b>You are a plant.</b>

09:11.790 --> 09:13.420
<b>Th-That's ridiculous!</b>

09:13.420 --> 09:15.150
<b>What makes you say that?</b>

09:15.670 --> 09:17.910
<b>Your chain just started swinging.</b>

09:18.250 --> 09:20.030
<b>That is dowsing.</b>

09:20.030 --> 09:22.410
<b>Huh? What's that?</b>

09:22.950 --> 09:25.040
<b>Dowsing was originally</b>

09:25.040 --> 09:29.000
<b>a technique for locating water 
or metals underground.</b>

09:29.740 --> 09:32.380
<b>But it was also used in divination.</b>

09:32.930 --> 09:37.180
<b>I've heard of the technique being 
employed as a lie detector.</b>

09:37.530 --> 09:39.020
<b>That still doesn't</b>

09:39.020 --> 09:43.180
<b>provide concrete proof that I'm a plant.</b>

09:43.700 --> 09:45.770
<b>He's probably right.</b>

09:46.570 --> 09:51.440
<b>Your heart began to pound as 
soon as he pointed at you.</b>

09:52.940 --> 09:54.620
<b>If you were innocent,</b>

09:55.520 --> 09:58.660
<b>your heart rate would have slowly increased,</b>

09:59.800 --> 10:02.800
<b>due to the stress of being wrongly accused.</b>

10:03.930 --> 10:07.330
<b>But your heartbeat immediately sped up,</b>

10:07.330 --> 10:10.570
<b>before gradually slowing down.</b>

10:12.340 --> 10:15.420
<b>The typical melody of a liar...</b>

10:16.280 --> 10:18.010
<b>Coming from both of you.</b>

10:20.510 --> 10:21.790
<b>I'm convinced.</b>

10:23.270 --> 10:25.180
<b>Both of them accuse you.</b>

10:25.570 --> 10:28.110
<b>That's two of the remaining five.</b>

10:28.110 --> 10:30.300
<b>Wait! Hold on!</b>

10:30.300 --> 10:32.150
<b>That doesn't make it true.</b>

10:32.560 --> 10:33.530
<b>It's possible</b>

10:33.530 --> 10:38.080
<b>that three out of five are 
applicants and two are fakes.</b>

10:38.080 --> 10:39.070
<b>I can confirm</b>

10:39.070 --> 10:41.580
<b>that he is not a plant.</b>

10:41.580 --> 10:42.960
<b>Excuse me?</b>

10:42.960 --> 10:44.790
<b>I think you meant "she," not "he."</b>

10:45.940 --> 10:47.710
<b>And it appears that you 
are not a plant, either.</b>

10:47.710 --> 10:51.770
<b>My point is that we can't trust you!</b>

10:51.770 --> 10:55.010
<b>You two could be working together.</b>

11:00.270 --> 11:03.400
<b>A-Anyway, this is a waste of time.</b>

11:03.400 --> 11:06.970
<b>We won't get anywhere by standing around.</b>

11:08.540 --> 11:12.730
<b>No other choice, then.
I will have to settle this
matter on my own.</b>

11:23.810 --> 11:28.000
<b>"Everything that comes 
into contact with my fist 
will completely burn."</b>

11:28.000 --> 11:29.120
<b>Huh?</b>

11:32.980 --> 11:34.210
<b>This is my special power...</b>

11:34.840 --> 11:36.750
<b><i>Great Haikuist!</i></b>

11:36.960 --> 11:40.010
<b>Great Haikuist
Wandering Haiku Poet</b>

11:49.840 --> 11:54.060
<b>Damn it all to hell.
It didn't burn very well.
That was a failure.</b>

11:57.830 --> 12:00.240
<b>That was a haiku,</b>

12:00.240 --> 12:02.510
<b>the prized literary art of my homeland.</b>

12:03.250 --> 12:06.240
<b>When I read a haiku, it happens.</b>

12:08.930 --> 12:10.720
<b>There's your explanation.</b>

12:10.720 --> 12:12.610
<b>Back to the subject at hand.</b>

12:17.420 --> 12:21.940
<b>"Any person who 
responds untruthfully to 
my question will burn."</b>

12:23.080 --> 12:27.850
<b>In other words, liars will burn in hell.</b>

12:30.600 --> 12:31.980
<b>Here is my question.</b>

12:33.220 --> 12:35.100
<b>Are you a plant?</b>

12:35.100 --> 12:35.980
<b>No.</b>

12:37.400 --> 12:38.560
<b>What about you?</b>

12:38.560 --> 12:39.730
<b>I am not.</b>

12:41.580 --> 12:42.740
<b>And you?</b>

12:43.260 --> 12:44.490
<b>No.</b>

12:47.100 --> 12:49.020
<b>Are you a plant?</b>

12:50.220 --> 12:52.250
<b>Yeah, that's right.</b>

12:56.080 --> 12:59.750
<b>Think carefully before you answer.</b>

13:01.790 --> 13:03.700
<b>Are you a plant?</b>

13:04.460 --> 13:06.610
<b>Give me your answer!</b>

13:21.300 --> 13:23.020
<b>My answer is yes.</b>

13:29.520 --> 13:30.850
<b>Impressive.</b>

13:30.850 --> 13:32.810
<b>I'll reward you with some information.</b>

13:33.320 --> 13:34.920
<b>My name is Squala.</b>

13:34.920 --> 13:37.290
<b>I don't have an official license,</b>

13:38.370 --> 13:42.310
<b>but I'm a Hunter with Manipulator skills.</b>

13:43.930 --> 13:45.740
<b>I've used my Manipulator abilities</b>

13:45.740 --> 13:48.290
<b>to instruct something to 
follow a certain order.</b>

13:48.290 --> 13:50.720
<b>You managed to unmask me,</b>

13:50.720 --> 13:54.180
<b>but that doesn't mean you'll 
be able to escape alive...</b>

13:54.600 --> 13:57.290
<b>What was the something, 
and what was the order?</b>

13:58.440 --> 14:01.460
<b>This wouldn't be much of 
a test if I just told you.</b>

14:01.460 --> 14:02.540
<b>Fool.</b>

14:03.190 --> 14:05.690
<b>Even if you torture me, I won't talk.</b>

14:06.510 --> 14:07.280
<b>Huh?</b>

14:22.030 --> 14:25.830
<b>This is my power, Instant Lover.</b>

14:26.230 --> 14:28.220
<b>I am also a Manipulator.</b>

14:28.780 --> 14:32.880
<b>Anyone I kiss becomes my slave.</b>

14:34.900 --> 14:37.640
<b>M-M-Mistress...</b>

14:41.800 --> 14:44.580
<b>Take that, and that, and that. 
And that... And that!</b>

14:46.130 --> 14:46.990
<b>More!</b>

14:46.990 --> 14:49.850
<b>Please step on me more...</b>

14:50.400 --> 14:52.240
<b>Now, answer my question!</b>

14:53.030 --> 14:56.130
<b>What did you use your <i>Nen</i> on, 
and what was your command?</b>

14:56.130 --> 14:58.300
<b>Talk, quickly.</b>

14:58.300 --> 15:00.000
<b>If you don't answer, I'll stop treading on you!</b>

15:01.190 --> 15:02.990
<b>I'll talk! I'll talk!</b>

15:02.990 --> 15:06.670
<b>I am just a l-lowly dog trainer...</b>

15:06.670 --> 15:08.100
<b><i>That is...</i></b>

15:08.100 --> 15:09.640
<b><i>A fearsome power.</i></b>

15:11.270 --> 15:13.920
<b>I used my <i>Nen</i> on the dogs</b>

15:13.920 --> 15:16.270
<b>that run around this mansion.</b>

15:16.270 --> 15:19.990
<b>For example, the Maltese were told to nip</b>

15:19.990 --> 15:22.050
<b>at a target's feet, to slow them.</b>

15:22.050 --> 15:27.260
<b>That's when the St. Bernard is to use 
its large body to smother the target.</b>

15:27.650 --> 15:30.970
<b>At the same time, the Dobermans will rush in</b>

15:30.970 --> 15:33.030
<b>and finish off the target...</b>

15:33.630 --> 15:36.180
<b>If the target still escapes, 
the bulldogs will—</b>

15:36.180 --> 15:37.490
<b>That's enough...</b>

15:37.490 --> 15:39.790
<b>Release the <i>Nen</i> you used on them!</b>

15:39.790 --> 15:41.200
<b>A-At once!</b>

15:53.880 --> 15:58.500
<b>So the dog tamer has been 
reduced to a pet, huh?</b>

15:58.500 --> 16:00.020
<b>Don't say that...</b>

16:00.020 --> 16:02.060
<b>I only did it to make him talk.</b>

16:02.680 --> 16:06.190
<b>If I wanted a man as a pet, 
I'd be more picky.</b>

16:06.990 --> 16:08.160
<b>That reminds me,</b>

16:08.160 --> 16:10.260
<b>I never did catch your name.</b>

16:10.260 --> 16:11.450
<b>I'm Basho.</b>

16:11.840 --> 16:14.760
<b>As you've already seen, I'm a Conjurer.</b>

16:15.160 --> 16:16.640
<b>I am Baise.</b>

16:16.640 --> 16:17.890
<b>Melody.</b>

16:18.530 --> 16:20.640
<b>It appears you can hear heartbeats.</b>

16:20.640 --> 16:22.210
<b>What category do you fall into?</b>

16:22.840 --> 16:25.960
<b>Well, I'm sure you'll find out soon enough.</b>

16:27.960 --> 16:29.710
<b>Playing coy, huh?</b>

16:31.410 --> 16:32.470
<b>What about you?</b>

16:35.920 --> 16:38.430
<b>I'd like to know your name.</b>

16:38.430 --> 16:39.780
<b>Would you tell us?</b>

16:40.390 --> 16:41.360
<b>I refuse.</b>

16:42.030 --> 16:44.810
<b>We do not know if we'll 
be working together.</b>

16:46.360 --> 16:48.030
<b>Yeah, that's true.</b>

16:48.030 --> 16:51.240
<b>We cleared the first test, 
escaping the mansion,</b>

16:51.240 --> 16:53.010
<b>but the real test has just begun.</b>

16:53.010 --> 16:55.940
<b>We must locate one of the designated items,</b>

16:55.940 --> 16:58.370
<b>or we can't get the job.</b>

16:58.760 --> 17:01.030
<b>If we're all interested in this job,</b>

17:01.030 --> 17:03.700
<b>we're bound to run into one other again.</b>

17:10.240 --> 17:12.450
<b>What is your opinion of this group?</b>

17:12.740 --> 17:15.370
<b>This particular group looks promising.</b>

17:15.790 --> 17:18.350
<b>More promising than him, at least.</b>

17:21.250 --> 17:23.680
<b>I will not require him for a while.</b>

17:23.680 --> 17:26.020
<b>Put him away for now.</b>

17:27.200 --> 17:29.330
<b>I trust you can handle that, Squala.</b>

17:29.330 --> 17:31.070
<b>Y-Yes...</b>

17:44.180 --> 17:47.270
<b><i>If I find one of the objects 
and earn the contract,</i></b>

17:47.620 --> 17:51.280
<b><i>I will have passage to the 
Yorknew City auction.</i></b>

17:51.280 --> 17:53.800
<b><i>Yes, I absolutely must attend!</i></b>

17:54.580 --> 17:56.990
<b><i>The Phantom Troupe will be there...</i></b>

17:57.510 --> 17:59.010
<b><i>The band of thieves</i></b>

17:59.010 --> 18:02.840
<b><i>that slaughtered my fellow Kurta.</i></b>

18:07.900 --> 18:11.660
<b><i>Our eyes burn a deep scarlet.</i></b>

18:13.420 --> 18:18.100
<b><i>Those thieves were willing to 
murder to obtain those eyes,</i></b>

18:18.100 --> 18:20.790
<b><i>considered one of the world's 
top seven beautiful things.</i></b>

18:21.110 --> 18:23.080
<b><i>I will never forgive that act.</i></b>

18:26.060 --> 18:27.970
<b><i>I shall track them down</i></b>

18:27.970 --> 18:30.110
<b><i>and utterly annihilate them!</i></b>

18:59.380 --> 19:02.370
<b>Hmm, so this is <i>Greed Island</i>.</b>

19:03.610 --> 19:08.490
<b>Looks like the memory card that 
Kil found is the real deal.</b>

19:09.490 --> 19:15.130
<b><i>You can probably decipher the data 
and recreate the game, right?</i></b>

19:16.490 --> 19:17.870
<b>You bet I can.</b>

19:18.270 --> 19:21.110
<b>I'll strip down the code, 
and clear the entire game.</b>

19:21.430 --> 19:23.100
<b>I'll put an end to the legend,</b>

19:23.100 --> 19:26.140
<b>winning fifty billion Jenny in the process.</b>

19:26.640 --> 19:27.760
<b>Oh, right.</b>

19:27.760 --> 19:29.880
<b>This was a trade...</b>

19:29.880 --> 19:33.900
<b>I have to tell Kil the URL for 
the Hunter-only website.</b>

19:41.060 --> 19:43.210
<b>If I break my end of the bargain,</b>

19:43.210 --> 19:47.760
<b>he might start talking about breaking 
my precious figures again.</b>

20:02.430 --> 20:04.180
<b>There it is, Killua.</b>

20:04.180 --> 20:07.190
<b>Yeah, we're almost to Yorknew.</b>

20:07.190 --> 20:10.860
<b>We'll see Kurapika and Leorio there.</b>

20:10.860 --> 20:12.450
<b>I can't wait!</b>

20:13.000 --> 20:14.450
<b>You're jumping the gun...</b>

20:14.450 --> 20:17.190
<b>We still have two weeks before 
we're supposed to meet.</b>

20:17.190 --> 20:18.670
<b>Oh, you're right.</b>

20:19.480 --> 20:23.200
<b>It's been six months since we 
saw them, so I'm getting excited!</b>

20:25.610 --> 20:27.260
<b>Six months ago, I'd never have dreamed</b>

20:27.260 --> 20:31.210
<b>that we would come to Yorknew 
for a reason like this.</b>

20:31.940 --> 20:32.990
<b><i>Until we meet again.</i></b>

20:32.990 --> 20:35.080
<b><i>Yeah, that'll be...</i></b>

20:35.620 --> 20:38.800
<b><i>September 1st, in Yorknew City.</i></b>

20:39.890 --> 20:42.670
<b>The auction begins on September 1st.</b>

20:42.670 --> 20:46.360
<b>We'll have to gather as much information 
on <i>Greed Island</i> as possible beforehand.</b>

20:46.360 --> 20:50.850
<b>Yep, there might be information about Ging.</b>

20:50.850 --> 20:55.230
<b>He left a memory card with his message.</b>

20:55.230 --> 20:56.850
<b>There must be a connection.</b>

20:57.300 --> 20:58.740
<b>Anyway, once I get the URL</b>

20:58.740 --> 21:02.610
<b>for the Hunter website from my brother, 
we can check it out.</b>

21:27.390 --> 21:28.380
<b>This is it.</b>

21:28.380 --> 21:29.760
<b>My brother sent the URL.</b>

21:29.760 --> 21:30.460
<b>Great!</b>

21:30.460 --> 21:31.950
<b>Let's get started.</b>

21:31.950 --> 21:32.970
<b>Yeah!</b>

21:36.450 --> 21:38.300
<b>Driven by their various goals,</b>

21:38.300 --> 21:41.280
<b>Gon and Killua prepare for September 1st.</b>

21:41.940 --> 21:49.080
<b>What will they discover when the 
Yorknew City auction begins?</b>

23:01.110 --> 23:06.150
