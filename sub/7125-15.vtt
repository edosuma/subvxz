WEBVTT

00:00.625 --> 00:03.625
[Samantha] When they write the
book of my life, what section
will I be in?

00:03.625 --> 00:07.166
Mystery, horror, romance

00:07.166 --> 00:11.208
or just misfiled and jammed
in the back under Military
History?

00:12.417 --> 00:14.625
No, I can't do it
like this, I can't.

00:14.625 --> 00:18.417
Sure you can. Hold onto The
Civil War, put your foot
on The Korean Conflict.

00:18.417 --> 00:20.709
What? No, no,
you have to break up with Cloe.

00:20.709 --> 00:23.083
You said you were going
to and now, here we are,

00:23.083 --> 00:26.583
sneaking around again... Thank
you for helping me find this
book on tanks.

00:26.583 --> 00:28.417
No, tank you!

00:28.417 --> 00:32.166
I'm serious, all right?
No more fooling around
until you tell her.

00:33.583 --> 00:36.125
I will. I'll do it today,
I promise.

00:36.125 --> 00:37.417
OK.

00:37.417 --> 00:39.417
I wanna be with you
on your birthday.

00:39.417 --> 00:42.458
I wanna start clean with you,
wanna be part of your life
again.

00:44.417 --> 00:45.875
It's my birthday?

00:56.750 --> 00:59.542
Anyway, my mom is going
to throw me a birthday party.

00:59.542 --> 01:02.291
And I'm going to have
a cake and ice cream.

01:02.291 --> 01:04.875
And hats. No kazoos.
I don't like kazoos.

01:04.875 --> 01:06.291
They sound like bees.

01:06.291 --> 01:08.375
I want you in charge
of the guest list.

01:08.375 --> 01:09.625
- Me?
- Mm-hmm.

01:09.625 --> 01:13.041
Yey! OK, I'm gonna invite
your mom and your dad,

01:13.041 --> 01:17.709
and Andrea,
and me, and, uh...

01:17.709 --> 01:18.750
Um...

01:20.583 --> 01:23.083
OK, that's it. Wow.
[chuckles]

01:23.083 --> 01:25.417
What do you want
for a gift?

01:25.417 --> 01:28.875
I don't know, I feel like I have
everything I want, you know?

01:28.875 --> 01:33.834
I have this new chance at my
life. I've got great friends
and family.

01:33.834 --> 01:37.834
And when Todd breaks up
with Chloe, a new boyfriend.

01:37.834 --> 01:40.667
Really? Is he going to break up
with her to be with you?

01:40.667 --> 01:43.166
Uh-huh, yeah, and because
she's a total loon.

01:43.166 --> 01:45.917
And emotional
and a little unstable.

01:45.917 --> 01:49.750
You know what? Switch with me, I
don't want my back to the door.

01:49.750 --> 01:51.208
Thanks.

01:51.208 --> 01:57.000
Move. I want the sun behind me
today. It'll look good in my
hair.

01:57.000 --> 02:00.000
- What are you doing?
- Mom's throwing me
a birthday party.

02:00.000 --> 02:03.875
- We're figuring out
who's coming.
- No one. We don't do birthdays.

02:03.875 --> 02:05.834
We go to the spa,
we fast all day,

02:05.834 --> 02:09.792
we wrap ourselves in seaweed
and we sweat out our toxins.

02:09.792 --> 02:12.041
- I want a piñata.
- Oh!

02:12.041 --> 02:13.333
Yeah.

02:13.333 --> 02:16.208
Oh, my God, it's Chloe and Todd.
Duck, duck, duck!

02:16.208 --> 02:18.500
Get down! Get down!
Get down! Get down!

02:18.500 --> 02:20.834
- Andrea!
- What are you doing?

02:20.834 --> 02:24.333
[whispers] Todd is breaking up
with Chloe today.

02:27.875 --> 02:31.083
And I'd say
she's taking it very well.

02:36.917 --> 02:39.959
- Hey, what are you doing here?
- Nothing.

02:39.959 --> 02:42.583
Just came by to see
how the breakup went.

02:42.583 --> 02:44.083
How'd Chloe take it?

02:44.917 --> 02:46.250
Pretty well.

02:46.250 --> 02:49.542
Good, because I was afraid she
had trouble understanding you

02:49.542 --> 02:53.291
- with your tongue in her mouth.
- You were at the aquarium?

02:53.291 --> 02:57.250
What? Todd! You know what?
I would not have been fooling
around with you

02:57.250 --> 02:59.792
if you weren't going to be
breaking up with her.

02:59.792 --> 03:02.291
This was supposed to be
just a little overlap.

03:02.291 --> 03:06.500
The longer you keep your
girlfriend, I'm just a
boyfriend-stealing whore.

03:06.500 --> 03:08.250
You're making me
into a whore.

03:08.250 --> 03:11.250
I was going to tell her,
but her aunt is sick.

03:11.250 --> 03:12.917
Her aunt is sick?

03:12.917 --> 03:15.875
She found out her Aunt Wendy,
who practically raised her,

03:15.875 --> 03:17.917
was admitted
to St. Sofia's Hospital.

03:17.917 --> 03:20.291
But you know what?
If you break up with her now,

03:20.291 --> 03:24.250
she could meet somebody there.
A hospital's kind of like a
nightclub.

03:24.250 --> 03:29.000
You know, they got cute people,
and skimpy outfits, and drugs.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.959
That's not what
she's thinking about.

03:30.959 --> 03:34.417
Because she doesn't know you
promised to spend my birthday
with me.

03:34.417 --> 03:38.166
You're putting Chloe's feelings
before mine because she is
vulnerable.

03:38.166 --> 03:40.542
You don't think
that I'm feeling vulnerable?

03:40.542 --> 03:42.125
I am turning one!

03:50.041 --> 03:52.041
Oh, Andrea.

03:52.041 --> 03:55.375
Honey, do we need
any drinking done?

03:55.375 --> 03:57.709
Sorry, dear,
check back next week.

03:57.709 --> 03:59.792
[laughing]

03:59.792 --> 04:02.125
Always funny.

04:02.125 --> 04:03.625
Yeah.

04:03.625 --> 04:08.208
OK, I'm going to make this
quick, then you can get back
to your nap.

04:08.208 --> 04:11.083
Samantha is not having
her birthday party here.

04:11.083 --> 04:14.291
No one is driving a half an hour
to the sticks to play Twister

04:14.291 --> 04:16.959
and watch a slideshow
of your trip to Akron.

04:16.959 --> 04:18.333
That was a great party.

04:18.333 --> 04:22.166
Samantha's birthday party
will be at my place on Saturday.

04:22.166 --> 04:24.792
You can come or not.

04:24.792 --> 04:28.250
I'd love to, but I'm having
Samantha's birthday party
that night.

04:28.250 --> 04:30.250
It's too bad
that you can't make it.

04:30.250 --> 04:33.125
OK, OK, that's enough,
Regina.

04:33.125 --> 04:36.291
I hate taking sides against you,
and I'll pay for this for years,

04:36.291 --> 04:39.500
but, you know, maybe Sam would
prefer a party in the city.

04:39.500 --> 04:41.750
Something hip.
You know, for the kids.

04:41.750 --> 04:44.750
Are you telling me you didn't
like your last birthday party?

04:44.750 --> 04:46.875
People loved making
their own place mats.

04:46.875 --> 04:50.250
It was great, but I'm talking
about a real city party.

04:50.250 --> 04:53.500
Like you see in the magazines,
where celebrities show up,

04:53.500 --> 04:59.291
like ESPN sideline reporter Suzy
Kolber. Come on, we'll make a
night of it.

04:59.291 --> 05:02.500
Well, OK. But I do the food.
That part's always a hit.

05:03.792 --> 05:05.542
Who doesn't love
ambrosia salad?

05:08.834 --> 05:11.917
No Todd on my birthday
because of some sick aunt.

05:13.250 --> 05:16.875
We should get a Todd piñata.
A Todd-yata.

05:16.875 --> 05:20.542
So I've called 21 people
and they all have jury duty.

05:20.542 --> 05:22.375
On a Saturday night?

05:22.375 --> 05:25.875
- There must be some
really big trial.
- No, there is no trial.

05:25.875 --> 05:30.000
These people are making up lies
to get out of something they
don't want to do.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.208
Oh, my God.

05:31.208 --> 05:33.250
I do not want to go over
to his place.

05:33.250 --> 05:36.291
He's gonna break up with me.
I could tell it in his voice.

05:36.291 --> 05:39.291
Then don't let him. He has no
right to break up with you.

05:39.291 --> 05:42.291
Not when your cousin is in the
hospital on his deathbed.

05:42.291 --> 05:45.667
- I don't have a cousin
in the hospital.
- You bet your ass you do.

05:45.667 --> 05:47.291
Oh!

05:47.291 --> 05:50.500
- Yes. Cousin What's-His-Name?
- Yeah.

05:50.500 --> 05:53.458
Go to the hospital, find the
name of someone who's there

05:53.458 --> 05:55.083
in case he sends flowers.

05:55.083 --> 05:57.792
Then if he goes there,
just put a picture of yourself

05:57.792 --> 06:00.125
next to the sick guy's bed.
It's airtight.

06:00.125 --> 06:03.166
You bought yourself a boyfriend
through Valentine's Day.

06:03.166 --> 06:06.417
God. Can I train
with you, Master?

06:06.417 --> 06:09.375
The way of the samurai
is a lonely path, darling.

06:09.375 --> 06:12.583
For you, ladies. From these
gentlemen right over there.

06:14.250 --> 06:16.625
But maybe not
so lonely tonight.

06:19.291 --> 06:20.583
[chuckles]

06:20.583 --> 06:23.625
"Sick aunt." Chloe is lying.

06:23.625 --> 06:27.250
Once I prove that, Todd will
have no problem breaking up
with her,

06:27.250 --> 06:30.667
and he will be mine.
And in time for my birthday.

06:30.667 --> 06:32.375
- So Todd is coming?
- Yeah.

06:32.375 --> 06:36.583
OK. Because this thing is really
starting to fill up, so...

06:37.625 --> 06:40.333
[indistinct chatter over PA]

06:48.125 --> 06:50.500
Hey. Got to stretch it out,
you know.

06:55.500 --> 06:58.291
- Help you?
- Oh! Hey there, nurse.

06:58.291 --> 07:01.291
Hi. Yeah, I'm just looking
for my Aunt Wendy.

07:01.291 --> 07:03.250
Last name?

07:04.417 --> 07:06.083
It's just Wendy.

07:06.083 --> 07:10.166
Always been Wendy to me.
Aunt Wendy. She's sick.

07:10.166 --> 07:13.542
Don't have a Wendy here.

07:13.542 --> 07:17.417
Thank you very much.
She's lying. I win.

07:17.417 --> 07:19.250
Got a Gwendolyn.

07:28.250 --> 07:30.709
[Samantha snickers]

07:30.709 --> 07:33.917
You are a worthy adversary
indeed.

07:43.291 --> 07:46.625
- Sorry. Did you need more time?
- No. No.

07:50.709 --> 07:52.291
[gasps]

07:52.291 --> 07:55.834
[fake sobbing]

08:01.250 --> 08:02.917
Yes. OK.

08:03.333 --> 08:04.375
[Chloe] Sam?

08:06.250 --> 08:11.917
And please take this woman
safely into the bosom and grace

08:11.917 --> 08:15.250
of your all-knowing arms,
amen.

08:15.250 --> 08:16.709
Hi, Chloe.

08:18.041 --> 08:22.417
I was just helping this poor
woman off to her reward.

08:22.417 --> 08:25.875
- What are you doing here?
- Oh, Chloe.

08:25.875 --> 08:28.166
I know that we've had
our differences,

08:28.166 --> 08:30.250
but when I found out
about your aunt,

08:30.250 --> 08:34.458
I just wanted to put all those
things aside and just be with
you.

08:36.083 --> 08:38.083
- Hi, Auntie Wendy.
- Hi.

08:39.250 --> 08:41.834
And there she is.
Your aunt.

08:41.834 --> 08:44.709
Well, congratulations.

08:44.709 --> 08:48.500
No, not congratulations.
I'm sorry, condolences.

08:48.500 --> 08:52.041
No, because that's not right
because she's not dead.

08:52.041 --> 08:53.875
Congratulations.

08:53.875 --> 08:55.250
Well, I'm off.

08:55.250 --> 08:56.458
Yeah.

09:01.667 --> 09:02.834
Hey, Frank.

09:06.291 --> 09:12.083
I was thinking how it must be
gratifying, doing your job.

09:12.083 --> 09:16.250
Being such an important part
of all these people's lives,

09:16.250 --> 09:19.000
who are coming
and going here.

09:19.000 --> 09:20.875
[chuckles]

09:20.875 --> 09:24.875
There's talk of replacing me
with a motion-sensing mat.

09:27.250 --> 09:29.250
Do you like birthday cake?

09:31.458 --> 09:34.250
Hey, Todd, listen,
I've done a 180

09:34.250 --> 09:36.917
on this whole you breaking up
with Chloe dealio.

09:36.917 --> 09:39.834
I don't think you should
break up with her yet.

09:39.834 --> 09:43.291
I was thinking about her aunt
and you're right, she's really
sick.

09:43.291 --> 09:46.166
Just call me back after you do
not break up with her.

09:46.166 --> 09:49.291
Do not! OK. Bye. Hi.

09:49.291 --> 09:52.583
I go to get my suit out
of the cleaners, for your
birthday party,

09:52.583 --> 09:54.583
the guys there
can't stop laughing.

09:54.583 --> 09:57.083
They're waiting to see
who picks up this suit,

09:57.083 --> 09:59.542
so they can see what his time
machine looks like.

09:59.542 --> 10:02.041
Well, I'm sorry
I don't dress like the Internet.

10:03.250 --> 10:05.250
[doorbell rings]

10:11.875 --> 10:14.959
I know, it's strange
that I just showed up here,

10:14.959 --> 10:19.208
but I found your address when
I was going through Todd's
computer last week,

10:19.208 --> 10:21.250
- and I need to talk to you.
- Yeah.

10:21.250 --> 10:23.417
Todd... [chuckles]

10:23.417 --> 10:25.250
- ...broke up with me.
- Oh?

10:25.250 --> 10:26.750
- Yeah.
- OK.

10:26.750 --> 10:29.291
- I really...
- What?

10:29.291 --> 10:32.417
...need a friend right now.

10:32.417 --> 10:35.667
All right. There, there.
OK, you know what?

10:35.667 --> 10:37.917
Your hands are little close
to my neck.

10:37.917 --> 10:40.834
I just don't... Yeah, all right.
OK, that's better.

10:40.834 --> 10:42.250
There, there.

10:42.250 --> 10:44.083
There, there.
[whispers] Dad.

10:46.000 --> 10:49.250
So, you really think that I'm
the one that you want to talk
to?

10:49.250 --> 10:52.250
Well, yeah. Why not?

10:52.250 --> 10:54.417
- I know you were with Todd.
- You do?

10:54.417 --> 10:57.125
No, I wasn't. When?

10:57.125 --> 10:58.875
For three years?

10:58.875 --> 11:03.250
This amnesia thing
is really tiring, I'm sorry.

11:03.250 --> 11:05.166
Yeah, no. I know.

11:05.166 --> 11:08.041
When you showed up to the
hospital to support me,

11:08.041 --> 11:10.834
that was the nicest thing
anyone's ever done for me.

11:10.834 --> 11:13.875
I think maybe
I misjudged you.

11:13.875 --> 11:16.291
Yeah, well, it happens.

11:16.291 --> 11:18.834
But you know what?
You seem OK.

11:18.834 --> 11:24.000
I mean, it's probably good
to just get all this bad news
out of the way.

11:24.000 --> 11:27.166
I'm sure that you're probably
more upset about your aunt

11:27.166 --> 11:30.250
- than you are about Todd?
- No, I'm more upset about Todd.

11:30.250 --> 11:35.250
Are you sure? Because I saw your
aunt and she wasn't looking so
great.

11:35.250 --> 11:36.959
Sammy? Hi.

11:36.959 --> 11:40.000
I can't go to this thing tonight
looking like a hayseed.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.959
- I'm off to the Suit Barn. Bye.
- OK.

11:42.959 --> 11:46.834
Yeah. He could come back at any
second, so just so you know.

11:46.834 --> 11:48.417
Oh, my God, look at this.

11:48.417 --> 11:51.291
Don't have a fit,
I'll clean it up.

11:51.291 --> 11:54.291
No, it's not that.
I just have never been in here.

11:54.291 --> 11:58.250
I wasn't even sure
if the appliances were real, um.

11:58.250 --> 12:01.750
Oh, come on. You must have
cooked breakfast for hundreds
of young men.

12:01.750 --> 12:04.875
I can cook, you know.
I just usually go out.

12:04.875 --> 12:08.417
That must be nice.
Clubs, restaurants...

12:08.417 --> 12:11.959
Yeah, sometimes it's nice
to stay in.

12:11.959 --> 12:15.250
- I bet you travel
a lot too, don't you?
- Yeah, on business.

12:15.250 --> 12:17.250
Where's the...

12:17.250 --> 12:19.500
Where's the farthest
you've ever been?

12:19.500 --> 12:21.250
I don't know. Marrakech?

12:21.250 --> 12:24.250
Marrakech.
Oh, my God, how exotic.

12:24.250 --> 12:25.834
Mmm.

12:25.834 --> 12:29.166
Howard and I haven't been
anywhere but Pensacola.
He won't fly.

12:29.166 --> 12:32.083
He hates to take his shoes off
in front of people.

12:33.291 --> 12:36.291
But I'm hopeful.
I keep buying travel magazines.

12:37.291 --> 12:39.125
OK, do not tell anyone this.

12:39.125 --> 12:41.875
But once a year
I buy Good Housekeeping.

12:41.875 --> 12:44.458
- The issue with...
- One hundred holiday ideas.

12:44.458 --> 12:45.625
Me, too.

12:46.417 --> 12:48.875
[both chuckle]

12:48.875 --> 12:52.625
You know, Andrea, you could
make this kitchen fun to use.

12:52.625 --> 12:56.291
You could have everything
in the open, hang a pot rack
over the stove.

12:56.291 --> 12:58.917
- Like I can hang a pot rack.
- Well, yeah.

12:58.917 --> 13:01.000
My husband does those things
for me.

13:01.000 --> 13:05.125
See, I need that.
A man with tools. It's very hot.

13:06.166 --> 13:07.750
I can use a man like that.

13:09.709 --> 13:11.125
Howard has shingles.

13:14.834 --> 13:18.458
Anyway, Todd and I were just
about to record a new outgoing
message:

13:18.458 --> 13:20.750
"Hi, it's the home
of Todd and Chloe,

13:20.750 --> 13:23.208
leave a message,
whether friend or foe-y!"

13:23.208 --> 13:26.417
Anyway, so he was supposed
to do "friend or foe-y!"

13:26.417 --> 13:29.625
And all of a sudden he said,
"This isn't working out".

13:29.625 --> 13:31.417
And I knew he meant us.

13:31.417 --> 13:34.583
Because I've had that message
for years, people love it.

13:34.583 --> 13:37.291
Mmm. Mmm.

13:37.291 --> 13:40.250
[clears throat]
And he gave no reason at all?

13:40.250 --> 13:43.250
Nope. But I know
he's seeing someone.

13:43.250 --> 13:47.083
- You do? How can you?
No, you can't.
- Because he's Todd.

13:47.083 --> 13:49.333
- That's what he does.
- What's what he does?

13:49.333 --> 13:52.417
Not leave someone
until he has someone else.

13:52.417 --> 13:56.333
You know, like how he was with
you before he left his previous
girlfriend?

13:56.333 --> 13:59.583
And he and I were making out
for a full two weeks

13:59.583 --> 14:01.834
before he finally
broke it off with you.

14:03.250 --> 14:05.917
Hmm?

14:05.917 --> 14:09.250
So, Howard, are you enjoying
your city party?

14:09.250 --> 14:11.417
Even Samantha
didn't bother to come.

14:11.417 --> 14:14.250
The place will fill up,
they're fashionably late.

14:14.250 --> 14:17.000
You know some of these people,
these glitterati,

14:17.000 --> 14:19.250
they don't roll in
until at least 8:30.

14:19.250 --> 14:22.500
Look at you. Very nice.

14:22.500 --> 14:24.917
Yes, yes, he knows.
Moving along.

14:24.917 --> 14:27.250
[lounge music]

14:27.250 --> 14:29.208
Look at me, my shoes
are all wrong.

14:29.208 --> 14:32.250
No one will see me since you
didn't get anyone here.

14:32.250 --> 14:35.250
I did so! This is not everyone.
Other people are coming.

14:35.250 --> 14:36.792
[doorbell rings]

14:36.792 --> 14:37.875
See?

14:39.709 --> 14:41.458
[grunts]

14:41.458 --> 14:45.250
Hello. I wasn't going to come,
but my wife doesn't want me
around

14:45.250 --> 14:49.041
during our daughter's homework
time. She says I get impatient.

14:49.041 --> 14:51.041
It's just decimals,
for God's sake.

14:51.041 --> 14:54.250
You move it one place for every
tenth, how hard is that?

14:55.375 --> 14:57.417
I'm going
to want some wine.

14:59.041 --> 15:02.625
OK, now everyone is here.

15:02.625 --> 15:04.250
Why didn't you tell me?

15:04.250 --> 15:08.250
I know 15 Eurotrash partiers who
could be here in five minutes.

15:08.250 --> 15:10.959
Samantha's party, you can't
fill it with strangers.

15:10.959 --> 15:12.875
- She has amnesia.
- Start dialing.

15:15.125 --> 15:16.583
- Hey. Happy birthday.
- Hi.

15:16.583 --> 15:19.792
Thank you.
Before we go to the party,

15:19.792 --> 15:23.125
I need to ask you
something quick.

15:23.125 --> 15:27.667
Were you fooling around with
Chloe before you broke up
with me?

15:30.375 --> 15:32.250
You look really pretty.

15:32.250 --> 15:34.709
Were you ever going
to tell me about it?

15:34.709 --> 15:36.875
I did. Before the accident.

15:36.875 --> 15:40.125
Oh, God, don't.
You can't pull it off.

15:40.125 --> 15:42.542
Well, I'm sorry
I'm not as good a liar as you.

15:42.542 --> 15:45.250
You were able to sleep
with the French guy.

15:45.250 --> 15:48.166
I can't believe you're gonna
bring up René right now.

15:48.166 --> 15:50.834
I think it's the perfect time
to bring him up.

15:50.834 --> 15:53.458
You didn't know about that
until after we broke up.

15:53.458 --> 15:55.542
You didn't know about Chloe
until after.

15:55.542 --> 15:57.625
- That is very different!
- [laughs] How?

15:57.625 --> 16:00.041
Because I am not
like that anymore.

16:00.041 --> 16:03.875
That was Bad Sam and you're
just, you know, Same Todd.

16:03.875 --> 16:07.417
And I don't want to live like
that. I have nothing to hide.

16:07.417 --> 16:08.875
Hide!

16:10.291 --> 16:13.375
Go in that one.
Go into that one.

16:15.333 --> 16:18.000
Oh, my God.

16:18.000 --> 16:21.000
[whispers] To an outside
observer, this might not seem

16:21.000 --> 16:23.250
like a very healthy
relationship.

16:24.250 --> 16:27.166
[up-tempo music]

16:27.166 --> 16:28.834
You sure? OK. All right.

16:28.834 --> 16:30.250
- Anybody?
- [doorbell rings]

16:30.250 --> 16:34.125
Oh, Frank, my hands are full,
could you get that, please?

16:34.125 --> 16:36.208
Nope. I'm off the clock.

16:36.208 --> 16:38.834
I don't open doors,
I won't call you a cab,

16:38.834 --> 16:42.792
and I won't find you an escort
service. Good ambrosia, though.

16:42.792 --> 16:44.333
Oh, thank you.

16:45.959 --> 16:49.000
Would you have broken up with
Chloe if I hadn't pushed you?

16:49.000 --> 16:51.041
Wait, you want to talk
about this now?

16:51.041 --> 16:54.583
- You got somewhere to be?
- OK. Yes.

16:54.583 --> 16:57.208
- No, you would not.
- Shh!

16:57.208 --> 16:59.709
- How do you know
about Chloe and me?
- She told me.

16:59.709 --> 17:03.166
Because this is what you do,
right? Because you can't be
alone.

17:03.166 --> 17:06.667
You just swing from girl to girl
like monkey bars.

17:06.667 --> 17:09.250
- Why is Chloe talking to you?
- Because...

17:09.250 --> 17:11.583
That is, you know,
it's not important.

17:11.583 --> 17:14.250
Did you tell her
you and I have been making out?

17:14.250 --> 17:18.250
No, Todd, I think that the girl
has been through enough, don't
you?

17:18.250 --> 17:20.041
- Bad Sam.
- Stop that!

17:20.041 --> 17:21.959
[rattling]

17:23.291 --> 17:25.458
- She's coming. She's coming.
- What?

17:25.458 --> 17:27.291
Move. Move out of my way!

17:28.583 --> 17:30.291
Get down!

17:32.417 --> 17:35.000
- Oh, God!
- Oh, God, you scared me.

17:35.000 --> 17:36.500
Yeah, you scared me too.

17:36.500 --> 17:38.917
I thought you were Todd.

17:38.917 --> 17:40.250
What are you doing?

17:40.250 --> 17:44.959
I was just getting some shoes
to wear for my birthday party.

17:44.959 --> 17:47.959
Well, you didn't say
you were having a party.

17:47.959 --> 17:51.041
Oh, yeah.
Well, it's a surprise.

17:51.041 --> 17:55.250
- But you already know.
- Oh, shoot,
I ruined the surprise.

17:55.250 --> 17:58.250
- What?
- I don't know.

17:58.250 --> 18:00.709
I can't do this.
I can't do this.

18:00.709 --> 18:04.542
I'm sorry, Chloe,
Todd and I are together.

18:04.542 --> 18:07.333
Oh, my God,
you're so pathetic.

18:07.333 --> 18:12.291
I know you have amnesia
and everything, but you
tried this already, remember?

18:12.291 --> 18:14.959
Where's Todd supposed
to be this time?

18:14.959 --> 18:19.083
Where is he? In the bathroom?
No, you did that one.

18:19.083 --> 18:23.375
Oh! Maybe he's in the closet?
Maybe he's in here.

18:23.375 --> 18:26.625
- That would be devastating.
- [rattling]

18:32.250 --> 18:35.041
I thought
you were my friend.

18:35.041 --> 18:37.250
You came to the hospital
and everything.

18:38.792 --> 18:42.291
Oh, my God, you two
deserve each other. Good luck.

18:49.792 --> 18:51.291
[door slams]

18:51.291 --> 18:53.417
- The hospital?
- It doesn't matter, OK?

18:53.417 --> 18:55.583
She's right.
I mean, look at us.

18:55.583 --> 18:58.041
Yeah, Chloe's gone,
and I am sitting here,

18:58.041 --> 19:00.583
but maybe I'm sitting here
because I'm not her.

19:00.583 --> 19:03.917
Or maybe I'm sitting here
because you just can't be alone.

19:03.917 --> 19:08.250
You know, now with you, I don't
know if I'm me or if I'm just
"not her".

19:10.750 --> 19:13.250
Are you saying you don't want
us to be together?

19:13.250 --> 19:17.333
No, I'm just saying that I am so
tired of being not someone.

19:17.333 --> 19:20.250
It's time
for me to be someone.

19:21.792 --> 19:24.875
Maybe if we were different
people or we had never met,

19:24.875 --> 19:27.166
we could have a fresh start,
but we're not.

19:29.542 --> 19:31.709
You still have stuff here,
you know.

19:32.709 --> 19:34.792
I'll always have stuff here,
Todd.

19:45.583 --> 19:48.166
♪ Happy Birthday
dear Samantha... ♪

19:48.166 --> 19:50.792
[Samantha] So the book of Sam
is ready for volume two,

19:50.792 --> 19:53.250
a stack of blank pages,
and no better way to begin

19:53.250 --> 19:57.250
than celebrating my first
birthday with my parents,
my friends

19:57.250 --> 20:00.959
and my remarkably attractive
and diverse seventh-grade
class.

Make a wish and blow.

- Make a good one.

- Hey.
- Hey.

My name's Todd.

20:31.083 --> 20:33.083
Um, Samantha.

20:33.083 --> 20:36.250
I think I've seen you
at the coffee place.

20:36.250 --> 20:39.250
I usually don't do this,
but here's my number.

20:40.750 --> 20:44.542
Call me sometime
if you want to get together.

20:46.250 --> 20:47.333
- Thanks.
- Balloons.

20:54.834 --> 20:59.291
You got 21 people, so you make
20 cuts. It's not rocket
science.

20:59.291 --> 21:02.250
Just give me the knife.
Give me the knife.

21:02.250 --> 21:03.750
Give it, give it.

21:03.750 --> 21:06.250
- Thank you. Hold this.
- [gasps]

21:06.250 --> 21:08.250
I get to cut
the first piece, right?

21:08.250 --> 21:10.875
- Square plates
for a round cake.
- Who wants cake?

21:12.792 --> 21:15.458
You're amazing, Mom.
Thank you so much.
