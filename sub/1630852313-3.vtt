00:10.440 --> 00:13.920
<i>Although Matilda had
the most fun, with a capital F,</i>

00:13.920 --> 00:17.200
<i>at her Aunt Cat's,
the letter G for "grief"</i>

00:17.200 --> 00:19.840
<i>was never far behind.</i>

00:19.840 --> 00:23.880
<i>On this occasion, the grief
caused by a gradual fading</i>

00:23.880 --> 00:27.080
<i>from memory
of her vanished mother's face.</i>

00:28.640 --> 00:30.880
<i>It fell to Cat, who daily felt</i>

00:30.880 --> 00:33.480
<i>the absence
of her own daughter, Annie,</i>

00:33.480 --> 00:35.520
<i>to explain to our young heroine</i>

00:35.520 --> 00:38.880
<i>that although life
is often messy...</i>

00:39.600 --> 00:42.640
<i>...it's how you deal with it
that counts.</i>

01:52.600 --> 01:54.680
Watch the road.

01:57.640 --> 01:58.760
For goodness' sake!

01:58.760 --> 02:00.280
Sorry, Cat.

02:00.280 --> 02:01.760
Think I just saw a streaker.

02:01.760 --> 02:03.200
In Wildemarsh?

02:03.200 --> 02:06.240
Surely not.

02:06.240 --> 02:08.640
It would be great
if me and my artwork

02:08.640 --> 02:10.600
could get to the gallery
in one piece.

02:14.920 --> 02:18.200
<i>Though Wildemarsh had always
been known for books,</i>

02:18.200 --> 02:20.480
<i>this edgy modern newcomer</i>

02:20.480 --> 02:23.440
<i>intended to change
that perception.</i>

02:23.440 --> 02:28.400
<i>And Cat, the only local artist
whose work had any edge to it,</i>

02:28.400 --> 02:31.080
<i>was a small part
of their grand plan.</i>

02:40.960 --> 02:42.520
They've spelled "Edge" wrongly.

02:43.680 --> 02:44.960
It's back to front.

02:44.960 --> 02:47.000
It's intentional.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.200
How do you say it -- "egg-deee"?

02:49.200 --> 02:50.480
The letters don't work.

02:50.480 --> 02:52.600
It's not a word.

02:52.600 --> 02:54.480
Look at this place.

02:54.480 --> 02:56.720
Now, don't pretend you're not
even a little bit excited

02:56.720 --> 02:58.120
to be invited.

02:58.120 --> 02:59.920
More excited about
the free booze.

02:59.920 --> 03:01.800
Mm.

03:03.600 --> 03:06.120
"Dear Matilda...
loving my time working

03:06.120 --> 03:07.960
with Health Across the Globe
Foundation.

03:07.960 --> 03:10.280
Thinking of home and you."

03:10.280 --> 03:12.200
- Matilda.
- Daniel.

03:12.200 --> 03:13.680
"Love, George."

03:13.680 --> 03:15.200
- Hi.
Hi.

03:15.200 --> 03:17.400
Ah, Stone.

03:17.400 --> 03:20.400
Had multiple reports
of a streaker in the area.

03:20.400 --> 03:22.400
I would send P.C. Foster,
but he's off this morning,

03:22.400 --> 03:24.120
and I'm late
for the Inter-District Golf Cup.

03:24.120 --> 03:25.920
Don't worry, sir.
I've seen a naked man before.

03:26.840 --> 03:29.240
- Yes, well,

03:29.240 --> 03:30.640
of -- of course you have.

03:30.640 --> 03:32.400
You're a grown woman.

03:32.400 --> 03:33.960
Of course you've seen
a naked man before.

03:33.960 --> 03:35.920
Unless that's not your thing.

03:35.920 --> 03:37.280
Which is fine, obviously,

03:37.280 --> 03:40.200
but not...entirely obvious.

03:40.200 --> 03:44.240
Um, what I'm saying is,
I'm sure you can handle him.

03:44.240 --> 03:46.600
It. Handle it.

03:48.760 --> 03:51.040
Better be off.

03:51.040 --> 03:53.280
Yes. Good luck.

03:57.440 --> 04:00.400
Careful.
Just -- Oh.

04:11.880 --> 04:13.960
Cat Stone. Am I right?

04:13.960 --> 04:15.200
Yeah.
- Una Lowe.

04:15.200 --> 04:16.600
I run a commercial space
in London.

04:16.600 --> 04:18.600
- The Lowe Down Gallery?
- Oh, hi.

04:18.600 --> 04:21.680
My pal Vanessa's been banging on
about a fab local artist

04:21.680 --> 04:23.000
she'd found
for the opening of "Eg-da."

04:23.000 --> 04:24.920
Oh, that's how you say it.

04:24.920 --> 04:26.920
We'll take this in for you.

04:27.720 --> 04:29.920
So you deal in contemporary art?

04:29.920 --> 04:31.040
20th century onwards.

04:34.400 --> 04:36.400
- Hmm.

04:36.400 --> 04:38.160
<i>- Despite being</i>

04:38.160 --> 04:40.600
<i>perhaps the richest artist
in Britain,</i>

04:40.600 --> 04:43.400
<i>working-class agitator
Keith Kane</i>

04:43.400 --> 04:46.720
<i>still got a kick
from waggling his...</i>

04:46.720 --> 04:48.040
<i>-placards.</i>
Beautiful, yeah.

04:48.040 --> 04:49.880
What about this?

04:49.880 --> 04:51.680
Yeah, lift -- lift the sign
a bit, Keith.

04:51.680 --> 04:53.840
Lift the sign!

04:53.840 --> 04:55.440
Yeah?
Yes. There.

04:57.240 --> 04:58.760
- Nice.

05:03.760 --> 05:05.480
- Won't be long, bruv.

05:05.480 --> 05:07.160
I know.

05:07.160 --> 05:09.360
Detective Sergeant Stone,
Marsh Valley Police.

05:09.360 --> 05:11.120
Now get out of the road
and put some clothes on.

05:11.120 --> 05:14.000
This is state censorship!
Keep filming, Will.

05:14.000 --> 05:17.600
- Camera down, please, sir.

05:17.600 --> 05:21.200
<i>When their eyes met,
Matilda momentarily forgot</i>

05:21.200 --> 05:25.200
<i>about the naked man
5 feet and 2 inches away</i>

05:25.200 --> 05:27.680
<i>and was swept up in a feeling
she had not experienced</i>

05:27.680 --> 05:31.360
<i>since her first encounter
with Dr. Daniel Lynch.</i>

05:32.440 --> 05:33.440
Too much?

05:39.080 --> 05:41.480
It's safe
to look again now, Officer.

05:41.480 --> 05:43.000
I take it this is
a publicity stunt

05:43.000 --> 05:46.000
for the opening
of the new E-G-D-E gallery?

05:46.000 --> 05:48.280
A rozzer who's into art.
Quirky.

05:48.280 --> 05:50.520
My aunt's paintings
are part of it.

05:50.520 --> 05:52.000
Well, I'm sure she'd agree --
It's our job

05:52.000 --> 05:53.400
to challenge through our work.

05:53.400 --> 05:55.200
Maybe, but it's my job
to enforce

05:55.200 --> 05:56.880
Section Five
of the Public Order Act.

05:56.880 --> 06:00.320
I'm sorry, Officer. We didn't
mean to break any laws.

06:00.320 --> 06:02.280
I will take my boss
back to Egde,

06:02.280 --> 06:03.240
and I'll keep him
out of trouble.

06:07.360 --> 06:10.400
<i>As Keith Kane was forced
to cover up,</i>

06:10.400 --> 06:13.400
<i>Vanessa Mills
was rather anxious</i>

06:13.400 --> 06:16.480
<i>about exposing her new venture
to the art world.</i>

06:16.480 --> 06:18.520
No, gallery two.

06:21.000 --> 06:22.520
Excuse me.

06:22.520 --> 06:24.400
The private view
doesn't start till 2:00.

06:24.400 --> 06:26.360
Oh, we're Cat Stone's sisters,

06:26.360 --> 06:28.880
here helping to get
her work in situ.

06:28.880 --> 06:30.680
Ah, yes.

06:30.680 --> 06:34.640
I have three Stones on
the list -- Annie, Beth, Jane.

06:34.640 --> 06:36.200
We're Beth and Jane.

06:36.200 --> 06:38.440
Oh, welcome.
Have a listing.

06:38.440 --> 06:40.840
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

06:40.840 --> 06:44.040
You must excuse me.
Final touches.

06:46.760 --> 06:48.920
Cat invited Annie?

06:48.920 --> 06:51.040
- Did you know?
- No.

06:51.960 --> 06:56.200
<i>And that wasn't the only secret
being discussed in Wildemarsh.</i>

06:56.200 --> 07:02.000
<i>Two men, both bound for Egde,
were also privately plotting.</i>

07:03.240 --> 07:04.760
I'm expecting the money
to be paid

07:04.760 --> 07:07.240
in two tranches as agreed, yes?

07:07.240 --> 07:09.760
Yep. 80% to
your new Swiss bank account,

07:09.760 --> 07:11.120
and I have a check for the rest.

07:11.120 --> 07:13.640
Good. And my sure my wi--

07:13.640 --> 07:15.680
my soon-to-be ex-wife...

07:15.680 --> 07:18.360
make sure she sees that check
today, okay?

07:18.360 --> 07:21.400
You're asking
for trouble, Fintan.

07:21.400 --> 07:24.440
And so was Vanessa when she
filed for divorce.

07:37.000 --> 07:39.760
<i>Take all power.</i>

07:39.760 --> 07:43.040
WOMAN #<i>Take all power.
Yes, I can.</i>

07:44.520 --> 07:46.520
That looks therapeutic.

07:46.520 --> 07:48.880
It does rather.

07:48.880 --> 07:50.360
WOMAN #<i>Take all power.</i>

07:50.360 --> 07:52.960
Here's the flyer
for my upcoming show.

07:52.960 --> 07:56.400
You should...check it out.

07:56.400 --> 07:57.960
My number's on the back.

08:00.360 --> 08:02.120
I will.

08:06.000 --> 08:07.640
Robert Cox.

08:07.640 --> 08:08.920
Major collector.

08:08.920 --> 08:10.520
And one of my best clients.

08:10.520 --> 08:12.400
Robert.

08:14.480 --> 08:16.720
<i>Money, money, and more money</i>

08:16.720 --> 08:18.960
<i>ruled the world
of the modern art.</i>

08:18.960 --> 08:22.720
<i>And it just so happened
Robert Cox was made of it.</i>

08:22.720 --> 08:25.680
I am thrilled
that you could make it.

08:25.680 --> 08:27.920
You are a fab friend.

08:27.920 --> 08:30.600
<i>Though the provenance
of his great wealth</i>

08:30.600 --> 08:33.200
<i>had, thus far,
remained a mystery.</i>

08:33.200 --> 08:35.240
I wouldn't have missed it
for the world.

08:35.240 --> 08:38.000
- How's rural life treating you?
- Oh, it's been brilliant.

08:38.000 --> 08:42.120
And a welcome distraction
from this hideous divorce.

08:43.680 --> 08:47.440
10,000 likes already, baby!

08:47.440 --> 08:50.560
Oh! You're a gem!

08:55.920 --> 08:58.040
Oh, Stone.

08:58.040 --> 08:59.640
What happened to the streaker?

08:59.640 --> 09:01.760
Publicity stunt
for that new art gallery, sir.

09:01.760 --> 09:04.960
I issued a warning. Looks like
you've had a successful morning.

09:04.960 --> 09:06.400
This?

09:06.400 --> 09:08.200
No.
Second prize, I'm afraid.

09:08.200 --> 09:09.680
A prize is a prize, sir.

09:09.680 --> 09:11.640
All your practice paid off.
That's a result.

09:11.640 --> 09:14.040
Well, if you think it
appropriate,

09:14.040 --> 09:15.760
we could display it.

09:15.760 --> 09:17.640
Thank you, Sergeant.

09:22.640 --> 09:24.400
He's handsome.

09:24.400 --> 09:27.040
Yes, but he's
far too young for you.

09:27.040 --> 09:29.200
He's closer to Matilda's age.

09:32.440 --> 09:33.960
Ohhh.

09:45.800 --> 09:48.040
Shifting art's hard work.

09:48.040 --> 09:50.440
Tell me about it.

09:50.440 --> 09:52.800
I am William.
I'm Keith Kane's assistant.

09:52.800 --> 09:55.240
- Beth.
- And Jane Stone.

09:55.240 --> 09:57.480
Oh, I think I met another
of your relatives earlier --

09:57.480 --> 09:58.760
a police sergeant.

09:58.760 --> 10:01.000
Ah, Mattie, our niece.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.880
I hope you weren't in trouble.

10:02.880 --> 10:04.520
Me? No.

10:04.520 --> 10:06.440
But trouble
is kind of Kane's thing.

10:06.440 --> 10:08.080
She dealt with him
better than most, though.

10:08.080 --> 10:09.960
She has a knack
with difficult people.

10:09.960 --> 10:11.680
No idea why.

10:11.680 --> 10:13.200
Oh, there you are.

10:13.200 --> 10:14.640
We should go back and change.

10:14.640 --> 10:16.200
I don't want to be late
for the preview.

10:16.200 --> 10:17.520
Oh. Bye.

10:17.520 --> 10:18.480
Bye.

10:25.200 --> 10:29.080
<i>As the Stone sisters
headed home to dress up,</i>

10:29.080 --> 10:31.240
<i>Fintan Boyle was preparing
to give</i>

10:31.240 --> 10:37.000
<i>his soon-to-be-ex wife
a financial dressing down.</i>

10:56.680 --> 10:58.960
Ah.

10:58.960 --> 11:00.840
That train journey down here

11:00.840 --> 11:04.240
lasted longer
than the bloody Renaissance.

11:08.600 --> 11:11.280
This is a private viewing,
Fintan.

11:11.280 --> 11:13.960
And you most definitely
were not invited.

11:13.960 --> 11:15.440
As if I'm here to see you...

11:15.440 --> 11:18.520
or your sad little cowshed
of a gallery.

11:18.520 --> 11:22.320
Now, where did I put
that brochure? Ah.

11:23.200 --> 11:25.720
Yes. F.Y.I. --

11:25.720 --> 11:29.080
My deal with Cox means
that work by my best students

11:29.080 --> 11:32.840
will be exhibited
for my lifetime.

11:32.840 --> 11:35.440
<i>Although Fintan Boyle
had saved the nation</i>

11:35.440 --> 11:39.560
<i>from some deeply subpar art,
Kane and Yetao,</i>

11:39.560 --> 11:42.040
<i>as former students,
still bore the scars</i>

11:42.040 --> 11:44.520
<i>of his brutal teaching methods.</i>

11:44.520 --> 11:46.720
Mm. Impressive.

11:46.720 --> 11:49.520
It's, uh, very you.

11:49.520 --> 11:52.040
Devoid of style,
meaning, or wit.

11:55.560 --> 11:56.600
Robert?

12:00.400 --> 12:04.200
Fintan...
the terms of our divorce

12:04.200 --> 12:05.920
mean that half of the proceeds
are mine.

12:10.880 --> 12:12.240
Is this some sort of a joke?

12:13.400 --> 12:16.240
Those artworks
are worth 10 times that!

12:16.240 --> 12:21.200
Mm, true, but, see, a man's
legacy is far more important.

12:21.200 --> 12:23.360
Don't think I won't fight this.

12:23.360 --> 12:24.640
I'm about to phone my lawyer.

12:24.640 --> 12:27.280
Oh, be my guest.

12:27.280 --> 12:28.920
Vanessa.

12:31.360 --> 12:33.360
- Was that necessary, Fintan?
- Hmm?

12:33.360 --> 12:35.040
On the day
of her gallery launch?

12:35.040 --> 12:37.000
Oh, I thought so, yes.

12:37.000 --> 12:39.600
Oh, and, Una, you seem to have
developed quite the knack

12:39.600 --> 12:42.760
for uncovering
lost masterpieces.

12:42.760 --> 12:45.360
You really must take me
to this magic yard sale

12:45.360 --> 12:47.080
you've found sometime.

12:47.080 --> 12:49.720
Well, uh, I've been very lucky.

12:49.720 --> 12:51.960
Yes. Very lucky.

12:53.000 --> 12:54.680
Oh.

12:54.680 --> 12:56.720
Shame that wasn't lost, as well.

12:56.720 --> 12:59.760
Not that it's a masterpiece.

12:59.760 --> 13:02.920
Ducks.
Mm.

13:03.680 --> 13:06.040
Looking awfully infantile now,
Keith, eh?

13:08.280 --> 13:09.840
Oh!

13:09.840 --> 13:11.240
Maybe <i>you</i> should learn to duck!

13:12.160 --> 13:14.120
That's for the endless torment
you put me

13:14.120 --> 13:15.440
and all
the other students through,

13:15.440 --> 13:16.880
not to mention Vanessa.

13:16.880 --> 13:18.880
You bullying little nobody!

13:18.880 --> 13:21.080
You'd be a second-rate painter
and decorator

13:21.080 --> 13:22.720
- if it weren't for me.

13:22.720 --> 13:24.720
Keith, Keith.
He's not worth it.

13:27.680 --> 13:30.080
<i>Whilst Keith Kane
and Fintan Boyle</i>

13:30.080 --> 13:33.760
<i>practiced radical honesty
at Egde,</i>

13:33.760 --> 13:35.840
<i>back at
Wildemarsh Police Station,</i>

13:35.840 --> 13:39.480
<i>Matilda was inadvertently
catching Mrs. Edith Bryant</i>

13:39.480 --> 13:41.200
<i>in a lie.</i>

13:42.720 --> 13:47.040
<i>It appeared she had, in fact,
known Inspector Bryant...</i>

13:47.880 --> 13:49.360
<i>...quite well.</i>

13:49.360 --> 13:51.480
I've never been married.

13:51.480 --> 13:53.040
I'm sorry. I have to go.

13:58.920 --> 14:00.440
Big trouble in the art world.

14:12.080 --> 14:14.200
Keith, apparently the police
are on their way.

14:14.200 --> 14:15.800
Call me back.

14:18.200 --> 14:19.920
You seen this?

14:19.920 --> 14:21.400
You should.
You're in it.

14:21.400 --> 14:23.680
You and nine other men.

14:34.200 --> 14:35.760
Congratulations.

14:41.640 --> 14:44.720
Don't let Boyle get
in your head, Yetao.

14:44.720 --> 14:47.240
You're a star.
Enjoy it!

14:52.560 --> 14:54.920
Oh, I intend to.

14:59.840 --> 15:04.800
<i>While Yetao knew instantly
how to concoct a revenge,</i>

15:04.800 --> 15:08.880
<i>had she known of the imminent
arrival of Wildemarsh's finest,</i>

15:08.880 --> 15:13.000
<i>she might have reconsidered
the timing of her retribution.</i>

15:21.640 --> 15:24.000
Oh, no.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
Your turn to attack me now, huh?

15:26.000 --> 15:29.120
Revenge of the ex-students
part deux, is it?

15:29.120 --> 15:32.240
Just thought
you could use a drink.

15:32.240 --> 15:34.080
Huh.

15:40.280 --> 15:41.800
Mm!

15:41.800 --> 15:44.400
Typical.
Cheap plonk.

15:44.400 --> 15:47.240
All there was, I'm afraid.

15:47.240 --> 15:49.800
Mm...no, it's disgusting.

15:56.120 --> 15:58.480
I'm Vanessa Mills,
owner of Egde.

15:58.480 --> 16:00.520
D.S. Stone and P.C. Foster.

16:00.520 --> 16:02.000
We've had reports of an assault?

16:02.000 --> 16:03.920
Assault's a strong word.

16:03.920 --> 16:05.280
Keith was entirely provoked.

16:05.280 --> 16:08.560
- Keith Kane?
- Yes.

16:08.560 --> 16:10.040
Second time today
I've had to deal with Mr. Kane.

16:10.040 --> 16:11.040
Where is he now?

16:11.040 --> 16:13.720
He seems to have gone walkies.

16:16.240 --> 16:19.160
Geez,
this bargain basement champagne

16:19.160 --> 16:21.200
she just handed to me
tastes like a...

16:21.200 --> 16:24.400
chemical toilet.

16:24.400 --> 16:26.480
How can you serve it
to your guests, Vanessa?

16:26.480 --> 16:28.440
Pathetic.

16:28.440 --> 16:31.720
<i>It took remarkably little
detection on Matilda's part</i>

16:31.720 --> 16:35.720
<i>to see why someone might want
to punch Fintan Boyle.</i>

16:35.720 --> 16:37.200
Mr. Boyle, I'm D.S. Stone.

16:37.200 --> 16:38.200
Hm.

16:40.160 --> 16:41.920
I'll leave you to it.
- Yeah.

16:42.720 --> 16:44.440
He's barely hurt, Detective.

16:44.440 --> 16:46.040
Is this really a police matter?

16:48.360 --> 16:52.280
I want Kane in chains!

17:02.720 --> 17:04.200
Pretty sure

17:04.200 --> 17:07.280
you were gonna
keep him out of trouble.

17:08.080 --> 17:10.680
I kind of dropped the ball
on that one.

17:10.680 --> 17:13.400
Sorry, Sergeant Stone.
He won't have gone far.

17:13.400 --> 17:15.240
There's no way he'll miss
the unveiling of his new work.

17:15.240 --> 17:16.880
When is that?

17:16.880 --> 17:18.960
The doors open in an hour
and a half.

17:18.960 --> 17:20.360
Then we'll wait.

17:20.360 --> 17:22.680
Terry, keep watch
at the main entrance.

17:22.680 --> 17:24.040
On it, Sarge.

17:26.400 --> 17:30.640
I guess this is the paint
drying part of your job?

17:30.640 --> 17:32.040
Yeah, I guess it is.

17:34.440 --> 17:35.680
Let me know
when you hear from him.

17:35.680 --> 17:36.680
Yes, ma'am.

17:51.240 --> 17:53.360
- You look great.
- Yeah?

17:53.360 --> 17:54.840
Think there's some
important people coming,

17:54.840 --> 17:56.120
so I just wanna get it right.

18:01.600 --> 18:03.200
Okay.

18:03.200 --> 18:04.680
I'll see you there.

18:10.040 --> 18:12.720
Oh, I do hope Annie turns up.

18:12.720 --> 18:14.080
You and me both.

18:17.360 --> 18:18.760
Ah.

18:18.760 --> 18:19.840
Aah.

18:43.240 --> 18:45.040
I reckon you'll be pleased,
Mr. Cox.

18:48.520 --> 18:52.080
Ooh. Ahh.

18:55.640 --> 18:57.200
10 grand.

18:57.200 --> 18:58.680
Cash.

19:12.240 --> 19:15.960
Glad I found out about you,
Will.

19:15.960 --> 19:19.000
Now how do you feel
about doing me an O'Keeffe?

19:28.600 --> 19:30.040
What's he doing?

19:32.720 --> 19:34.760
Everything's gonna be okay.

19:34.840 --> 19:36.360
Everything's gonna be okay.

19:45.560 --> 19:48.200
Have you told your new best mate
Boyle about our business?

19:48.200 --> 19:49.920
- Why the hell would I?
- Well, he knows.

19:49.920 --> 19:51.400
Relax.

19:51.400 --> 19:53.440
If he does,

19:53.440 --> 19:54.640
I'll deal with him.

20:02.400 --> 20:04.040
I'd be more relaxed
if we weren't doing this

20:04.040 --> 20:05.640
with the police here.

20:05.640 --> 20:07.000
They wouldn't know
which way to hang it up,

20:07.000 --> 20:08.560
let alone if it's real.

20:18.960 --> 20:23.000
Fintan! Fintan!
You're going cuckoo.

20:49.600 --> 20:51.480
Moonlighting as a doorman,
Terry?

20:51.480 --> 20:52.960
Police business.

20:52.960 --> 20:56.200
Oh.

20:56.200 --> 20:57.360
Matilda's inside.

21:03.360 --> 21:05.160
<i>Surveying the guests,</i>

21:05.160 --> 21:07.200
<i>who ranged from
the obscenely fashionable</i>

21:07.200 --> 21:09.480
<i>to the fashionably rich,</i>

21:09.480 --> 21:12.880
<i>Cat ascertained that
the one VIP she wanted to see</i>

21:12.880 --> 21:14.200
<i>had not yet arrived.</i>

21:14.200 --> 21:17.400
Whiskey, no ice, please.
Thank you.

21:17.400 --> 21:21.400
<i>And her daughter,
Annie, wasn't the only no show.</i>

21:21.400 --> 21:25.880
<i>Keith Kane also remained
inconveniently unaccounted for.</i>

21:25.880 --> 21:28.080
William, where is he?

21:28.080 --> 21:30.200
I need Keith here in the flesh!

21:30.200 --> 21:31.760
I'll call him again.

21:31.760 --> 21:33.520
Vanessa. Oh, wow!

21:33.520 --> 21:35.080
This is fantastic!

21:37.200 --> 21:38.440
Hello.

21:55.720 --> 21:58.760
How many steps today?

21:58.760 --> 22:01.320
Only 9,000?

22:01.320 --> 22:03.920
Eat that and then
it's steamed veg for a week.

22:12.880 --> 22:14.760
Is Mr. Kane back?

22:14.760 --> 22:17.640
No. But he will be here.

22:17.640 --> 22:21.040
He loves to make
a dramatic entrance.

22:21.040 --> 22:24.560
Look, I hope this isn't weird,

22:24.560 --> 22:29.040
but would you go out
to dinner with me, tonight?

22:32.840 --> 22:35.920
Yes. I'd like that.

22:35.920 --> 22:38.880
Greetings,
fellow culture vultures.

22:38.880 --> 22:42.920
Welcome to this first preview
of my Egde.

22:45.200 --> 22:46.280
Thank you.

22:46.280 --> 22:48.000
So without further ado,

22:48.000 --> 22:51.200
I would like to unveil
an extraordinary new work

22:51.200 --> 22:54.200
by Keith Kane in gallery one.

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
So, what do you all think?

23:25.000 --> 23:27.080
I reckon I ducking killed it!

23:34.440 --> 23:38.080
<i>After a lifetime spent
demanding originality,</i>

23:38.080 --> 23:39.920
<i>to become a part in death</i>

23:39.920 --> 23:42.680
<i>of such a blatant rehash
of old work</i>

23:42.680 --> 23:44.640
<i>by his most famous student</i>

23:44.640 --> 23:48.160
<i>would have enraged
the late Fintan Boyle.</i>

23:48.160 --> 23:50.240
Some bruising to the face.

23:50.240 --> 23:52.640
Bloodshot eyes.

23:52.640 --> 23:56.480
Seems likely the victim
was asphyxiated using this...

23:56.480 --> 23:57.720
duck.

23:57.720 --> 24:00.120
Time of death?

24:00.120 --> 24:03.360
He's been dead a couple of hours
I'd say.

24:03.360 --> 24:06.840
I first spoke to Fintan Boyle
at 11:15

24:06.840 --> 24:09.680
and the preview guests
starting arriving at 2:00 PM.

24:09.680 --> 24:13.360
So our suspects are the people
at Egde between those times.

24:13.360 --> 24:14.840
What about your aunts?

24:14.840 --> 24:17.200
They were at Murder InK
getting changed.

24:17.200 --> 24:18.720
All this happened
right under your nose.

24:18.720 --> 24:20.680
It would seem so, sir.

24:23.200 --> 24:25.080
When I cautioned Kane in town,

24:25.080 --> 24:27.280
that's what was written
on his placard.

24:27.280 --> 24:29.640
"Am I art?" Hmm.

24:37.800 --> 24:38.880
<i>Fintan Boyle had
been a professional...</i>

24:38.880 --> 24:40.840
You both need to see this.

24:40.840 --> 24:43.400
<i>...at the Academy of
Arts for nearly 25 years.</i>

24:43.400 --> 24:46.640
<i>Among his top students
were Keith Kane...</i>

24:46.640 --> 24:50.120
<i>Meanwhile, 66 miles, 81 feet,</i>

24:50.120 --> 24:53.200
<i>and a smidgen short
of 10 inches away,</i>

24:53.200 --> 24:56.400
<i>Tanya Shaw was about
to visit her local library</i>

24:56.400 --> 24:59.720
<i>to return some long-overdue
adventure novels.</i>

24:59.720 --> 25:02.880
<i>When suddenly,
her plans changed.</i>

25:13.800 --> 25:15.400
Never had to worry
about a crime scene going viral

25:15.400 --> 25:17.760
when I first joined the force.

25:17.760 --> 25:19.200
Madness.

25:19.200 --> 25:21.440
I've been meaning to ask you,
sir,

25:21.440 --> 25:24.400
did you know
Inspector Bryant back then?

25:24.400 --> 25:27.480
<i>What Inspector Thorne
wanted to say next was...</i>

25:27.480 --> 25:29.120
I've always known that one day

25:29.120 --> 25:31.200
this question
would come from you.

25:31.200 --> 25:35.240
And the truth is,
I worshiped that man.

25:35.240 --> 25:37.480
And therein lies the rub.

25:37.480 --> 25:39.440
For how can you really know

25:39.440 --> 25:43.600
those that you place so high
upon a pedestal...

25:43.600 --> 25:46.120
<i>But what he chose to say was...</i>

25:46.120 --> 25:47.760
You've got a murder
to investigate, Stone.

25:47.760 --> 25:49.840
This is not the appropriate time
for a stroll down memory lane.

25:49.840 --> 25:52.400
You're right, sorry, sir.
I'll get on with the interviews.

25:52.400 --> 25:54.080
Vanessa Mills has volunteered
her office.

25:59.440 --> 26:01.040
Please remove your sunglasses.

26:09.040 --> 26:10.560
Thank you.

26:12.760 --> 26:15.760
Where did you go after
you assaulted Fintan Boyle?

26:15.760 --> 26:17.360
Walking...

26:17.360 --> 26:19.080
around the cemetery.

26:19.080 --> 26:20.600
Anyone witnessed you
on that walk?

26:20.600 --> 26:22.040
Other than the dead...

26:24.600 --> 26:27.520
If they did, I didn't see 'em.

26:27.520 --> 26:29.880
Let's discuss your relationship
with the deceased.

26:29.880 --> 26:31.360
Yeah, I can see
where this is going.

26:31.360 --> 26:33.520
Look, it's one thing
to chuck a punch,

26:33.520 --> 26:35.960
murder's not my style.

26:35.960 --> 26:38.360
And I haven't forgotten
what Fintan did for me.

26:38.360 --> 26:39.880
Gave me my career.

26:39.880 --> 26:42.400
How's that exactly?

26:42.400 --> 26:45.680
I was a student of his
at Pennysmith Academy of Art.

26:45.680 --> 26:47.240
End of the course, he convinced
the London art world

26:47.240 --> 26:48.720
I was the next big thing.

26:48.720 --> 26:50.400
Launched me.

26:50.400 --> 26:52.960
And yet you clapped
when you saw his corpse.

26:52.960 --> 26:55.080
I couldn't see him.

26:55.080 --> 26:57.840
There were people in the way,
I wouldn't have otherwise.

26:57.840 --> 27:00.000
The old me might've done,
stir things up a bit.

27:00.000 --> 27:02.720
But...

27:02.720 --> 27:05.200
yeah, I'm not like that anymore.

27:05.200 --> 27:06.760
Did you know Fintan Boyle
was coming?

27:06.760 --> 27:09.280
No, that was a nasty surprise.

27:09.280 --> 27:10.720
Why'd you think he did?

27:10.720 --> 27:12.840
For the sport of it.

27:12.840 --> 27:15.080
To get back at Vanessa
for finally leaving him.

27:15.080 --> 27:19.680
Shortly before he walked
into my fist, he told her

27:19.680 --> 27:22.120
he was selling a bunch
of their art off on the cheap.

27:22.120 --> 27:24.440
She's owed half in the divorce.

27:24.440 --> 27:26.760
Is that why you punched him?

27:26.760 --> 27:28.360
Word to the wise, detective,

27:28.360 --> 27:31.160
this is Fintan Boyle
we're talking about.

27:31.160 --> 27:33.440
You won't have to go far
to find people

27:33.440 --> 27:37.200
who wanted to quack him,
if you'll forgive the pun.

27:48.480 --> 27:52.040
So, Fintan, this is for you.

28:03.680 --> 28:06.200
Would an artist as world-famous
as Keith Kane

28:06.200 --> 28:09.640
usually exhibit somewhere
like Wildemarsh?

28:09.640 --> 28:12.240
Maybe he's here
for something else.

28:12.240 --> 28:13.560
- Like to murder someone.

28:15.840 --> 28:19.040
That Robert Cox is keen to get
far from the madding crowd.

28:23.560 --> 28:25.200
So, what are
your thoughts on the offer?

28:27.840 --> 28:32.520
Yeah, I know it sounds pricey,
but the man was murdered today

28:32.520 --> 28:36.480
and, I mean, people like
a macabre narrative.

28:45.680 --> 28:48.840
Oh, I can do 5-5,
only 'cause it's you.

28:48.840 --> 28:51.000
Otherwise I'll have to call
Prince El Saadawi.

28:54.960 --> 28:56.640
You got yourself a deal,
Ms. Marino.

29:06.200 --> 29:09.040
You should go and tell Matilda.

29:09.040 --> 29:10.680
You're the people person.

29:10.680 --> 29:12.360
No, Cat should.

29:12.360 --> 29:14.840
It's your exhibition.

29:14.840 --> 29:17.600
No! It should be Jane.

29:17.600 --> 29:20.280
Inspector Thorne likes
her way more than us.

29:20.280 --> 29:22.600
That's true.

29:22.600 --> 29:24.040
Go on, sis, you're up.

29:27.920 --> 29:29.360
If Boyle was a gate-crasher,

29:29.360 --> 29:31.560
that suggests his murder
wasn't premeditated.

29:34.600 --> 29:36.480
I'm so sorry to interrupt.

29:36.480 --> 29:39.000
But it seems that Robert Cox
is selling the Boyle Collection

29:39.000 --> 29:40.960
and for rather a lot of money.

29:40.960 --> 29:43.200
And you know this how?

29:43.200 --> 29:44.840
Well, it's really not my fault

29:44.840 --> 29:47.800
if some people speak
too loudly on their phones.

29:47.800 --> 29:49.200
Could be a motive.

29:49.200 --> 29:50.680
I'll talk to him next.

30:07.360 --> 30:10.240
Tell me about
the Boyle Collection.

30:10.240 --> 30:14.400
It's art by
all his top students.

30:14.400 --> 30:16.440
He got it cheap or free.

30:16.440 --> 30:18.640
And what's your involvement?

30:18.640 --> 30:20.640
I bought the 10 best pieces.

30:20.640 --> 30:25.240
To put on display at
Pennysmiths Academy of Art?

30:25.240 --> 30:28.640
For how long?

30:28.640 --> 30:30.840
His lifetime.

30:30.840 --> 30:33.280
So now that he's dead,
you can sell those artworks.

30:35.280 --> 30:37.920
Yeah.
You know, it's called business.

30:37.920 --> 30:41.720
I see a chance to make money,
I take it.

30:41.720 --> 30:43.800
What's your profit margin?
Millions?

30:47.520 --> 30:51.200
This is a bad time to lie to me.

30:51.200 --> 30:52.520
Okay.

30:52.520 --> 30:56.040
Look, Fintan made me
pay him twice.

30:56.040 --> 30:57.720
By check for Vanessa to see,

30:57.720 --> 31:00.680
and a separate transfer
of £2 million

31:00.680 --> 31:02.920
to his Swiss bank account.

31:02.920 --> 31:04.360
To stop her getting
her fair share

31:04.360 --> 31:05.920
of that money in the divorce?

31:05.920 --> 31:08.200
As far as I know,
I haven't broken any laws.

31:10.760 --> 31:12.360
I'll need those
bank transfer details,

31:12.360 --> 31:14.400
your fingerprints and DNA.

31:17.400 --> 31:20.000
I think I want the advice
of my uber-expensive lawyers

31:20.000 --> 31:22.040
before I give you a damn thing.

31:33.440 --> 31:35.240
Two glasses of water,
please, Terry.

31:45.840 --> 31:47.440
How long have you known
Mr. Boyle?

31:50.000 --> 31:52.640
That's a pretty rubbish attempt
to get my prints

31:52.640 --> 31:54.040
and DNA on the glass.

31:58.880 --> 32:02.240
Ahh, are we done
with this charade, love?

32:22.520 --> 32:24.160
What are we looking for?

32:24.160 --> 32:26.200
A way Keith Kane could have
snuck back to murder

32:26.200 --> 32:27.960
Fintan Boyle
without coming up the path

32:27.960 --> 32:29.720
and being seen by Terry.

32:29.720 --> 32:31.480
- Odd.
- Odd?

32:31.480 --> 32:33.280
Don't look now, but I think
someone over there

32:33.280 --> 32:35.720
is watching the gallery.

32:44.600 --> 32:46.040
Oh, she's coming over.

32:50.400 --> 32:52.920
Yeah, there's definitely
something odd about her.

33:12.880 --> 33:14.360
The graffiti by the body,

33:14.360 --> 33:16.560
it's the same as
on Kane's streaking sign.

33:16.560 --> 33:18.080
Yeah.

33:18.080 --> 33:19.600
But anybody could've seen that.

33:19.600 --> 33:21.080
We posted the photos
on social --

33:21.080 --> 33:24.200
we got about 20,000 likes
for the gallery already.

33:24.200 --> 33:26.720
Keith's very supportive
of Vanessa.

33:26.720 --> 33:27.760
Yeah, they go way back.

33:27.760 --> 33:29.280
Romantically involved?

33:29.280 --> 33:30.600
He does have a soft spot
for her,

33:30.600 --> 33:31.960
or he wouldn't
have done the show.

33:31.960 --> 33:35.680
But that's it as far as I know.

33:35.680 --> 33:37.440
Is he a suspect?

33:37.440 --> 33:41.760
We're looking at everyone
who was here at the time.

33:41.760 --> 33:44.200
So I guess this means
we will have to

33:44.200 --> 33:46.240
take a rain check
on that dinner then?

33:46.240 --> 33:49.400
Yes. For as long as
the investigation's ongoing.

33:59.400 --> 34:01.400
We'll...

34:01.400 --> 34:02.840
We'll book you all rooms in town

34:02.840 --> 34:04.320
till you've been cleared
to leave.

34:06.680 --> 34:09.640
You were in there with
that detective a long time.

34:09.640 --> 34:11.120
Don't worry.

34:11.120 --> 34:13.640
She was asking about
the Boyle Collection,

34:13.640 --> 34:16.640
that's all.

34:16.640 --> 34:18.040
What's up, Rob?

34:20.760 --> 34:23.760
Summat wrong?

34:23.760 --> 34:25.760
I've gotta go.

34:25.760 --> 34:27.320
Now!

34:35.400 --> 34:36.800
- Someone's left the gas on.

34:42.480 --> 34:44.480
He's making a run for it,
more like.

35:09.040 --> 35:11.520
Sorry, Madam. Madam!

35:11.520 --> 35:14.240
This is a crime scene.
You really can't be here.

35:14.240 --> 35:16.200
But I've come to see
the exhibition.

35:16.200 --> 35:17.200
I'm afraid it's been canceled.

35:17.200 --> 35:18.720
Thing is...

35:21.960 --> 35:25.600
Thing is, I've driven
a very long way.

35:25.600 --> 35:28.640
Can't I just go in
and see the art?

35:28.640 --> 35:30.080
I won't touch nothing.

35:30.080 --> 35:32.440
I'm afraid that's not possible.

35:32.440 --> 35:36.400
Mm. Okay.

35:36.400 --> 35:38.240
Looks like I'll have to
come back another day then.

35:38.240 --> 35:39.800
Mm-hmm.

35:44.000 --> 35:45.920
Terry?

35:45.920 --> 35:48.600
Robert Cox's fingerprints that
you got from the door handle,

35:48.600 --> 35:50.160
I ran them through the database.

35:50.160 --> 35:51.880
We got a hit?
- Yep!

35:53.840 --> 35:55.520
Cox's prints were flagged
in connection

35:55.520 --> 35:59.560
to the 2005 Ballings
Private Bank raid.

35:59.560 --> 36:02.880
£30 million in cash was taken
and never recovered.

36:02.880 --> 36:05.280
Well, that explains why
he refused to give us them.

36:05.280 --> 36:06.400
And how he got so rich.

36:06.400 --> 36:08.280
- Hmm.
- Mattie.

36:08.280 --> 36:10.600
Not now, Aunt Beth.

36:10.600 --> 36:12.640
Robert Cox just sped off
in his sports car,

36:12.640 --> 36:16.200
and Cat's gone haring after him
on her motorbike.

36:16.200 --> 36:17.640
- Hello?

36:17.640 --> 36:19.280
Matilda?

36:19.280 --> 36:20.600
I knew this tracker app

36:20.600 --> 36:21.840
would come in handy eventually.

36:21.840 --> 36:23.240
Where are they going?

36:23.240 --> 36:26.360
Ah, oh, she's headed
for Larkin Airfield.

36:26.360 --> 36:27.920
Oh!

37:04.840 --> 37:07.760
<i>As Cat made the
universally accepted sign for</i>

37:07.760 --> 37:10.440
"Please don't run me over!"

37:10.440 --> 37:14.240
<i>a seemingly small moment
from her vastly eventful life</i>

37:14.240 --> 37:16.680
<i>flashed before her eyes.</i>

37:32.200 --> 37:33.840
Get -- Get out of the way!

37:37.080 --> 37:39.280
Detective Sergeant Stone.
Out now!

37:50.200 --> 37:51.480
See you back at the station.

37:51.480 --> 37:52.600
Be warned.

37:52.600 --> 37:54.080
Inspector Thorne's super excited

37:54.080 --> 37:55.520
about the whole
bank heist thing.

37:55.520 --> 37:57.080
I bet.

37:59.400 --> 38:00.760
You scared me half to death
running out

38:00.760 --> 38:03.400
- in front of that plane!
- Bet you're glad I did, kid.

38:03.400 --> 38:05.680
No! I'd much rather he got away
than you got hurt.

38:08.880 --> 38:10.800
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

38:10.800 --> 38:12.960
I'm fine.

38:12.960 --> 38:14.600
You'd better get back to the
station before your governor

38:14.600 --> 38:16.040
takes all the glory.

38:43.440 --> 38:45.280
Oh!

38:55.000 --> 38:56.720
Can you hear that?

39:00.280 --> 39:01.480
It's locked.

39:01.480 --> 39:03.480
Terry, are you in there?

39:03.480 --> 39:04.800
Just -- Just hang on!

39:18.240 --> 39:20.520
It's okay, Terry.
We're here, you're safe.

39:20.520 --> 39:21.960
Oh, Terry.

39:27.880 --> 39:29.240
Here's your governor.

39:33.200 --> 39:34.680
- P.C. Foster all right?
- Yes, sir.

39:34.680 --> 39:36.400
Mild concussion.

39:36.400 --> 39:38.040
They'll keep in him overnight,
just to be safe.

39:38.040 --> 39:39.960
Good.
Did he say what happened?

39:39.960 --> 39:41.920
The last he remembers is
Cox tried to bribe him

39:41.920 --> 39:43.480
to let him go.

39:49.080 --> 39:51.600
<i>Having spent six
months of his police probation</i>

39:51.600 --> 39:54.760
<i>in Marsh Valley's
elite traffic division,</i>

39:54.760 --> 39:58.600
<i>Inspector Thorne saw this
as his opportunity to shine.</i>

39:58.600 --> 40:00.960
Feint whiff of burned rubber.

40:00.960 --> 40:03.360
These tire tracks are recent.

40:03.360 --> 40:05.880
Acceleration scuffs.

40:05.880 --> 40:09.160
The vehicle deliberately sped up
to ram Foster's car.

40:09.160 --> 40:11.440
This tire pattern is most common
in a larger vehicle,

40:11.440 --> 40:13.120
SUV or a van.

40:13.120 --> 40:17.400
So the question is, did Cox
get away or was he taken?

40:17.400 --> 40:19.240
You know, there was some
dodgy-looking woman

40:19.240 --> 40:20.720
watching the gallery,

40:20.720 --> 40:23.600
and Cox scarpered
the minute she went inside.

40:23.600 --> 40:25.040
Beth got her number plate.

40:28.040 --> 40:29.600
Hi.

40:29.600 --> 40:31.480
So, I couldn't help noticing

40:31.480 --> 40:33.760
that Cat left in a bit
of a hurry earlier.

40:33.760 --> 40:35.280
Is she all right?

40:35.280 --> 40:37.200
I'm sure she's fine.

40:37.200 --> 40:38.600
Robert Cox, on the other hand,

40:38.600 --> 40:40.440
could be in all sorts
of trouble.

40:45.600 --> 40:47.200
Funny she didn't ask what for.

40:51.880 --> 40:53.200
Mattie, hi.

40:53.200 --> 40:54.360
Did you catch up with him?

40:54.360 --> 40:55.920
Yes and no.

40:55.920 --> 40:58.240
The woman who was watching
the gallery earlier.

40:58.240 --> 40:59.920
Cat says you got
her number plate?

40:59.920 --> 41:02.600
Yup, hold on.
I wrote it down.

41:02.600 --> 41:08.280
It's L-F-1-3-U-C-R.

41:08.280 --> 41:09.760
It's a big 4x4.

41:09.760 --> 41:11.520
Thanks, Aunt Beth.

41:11.520 --> 41:14.880
"Before Our Young Lives End."

41:14.880 --> 41:16.440
Huh?

41:21.400 --> 41:26.760
<i>Before Our Young Lives End.</i>

41:26.760 --> 41:28.960
Yetao's artwork.

41:28.960 --> 41:30.880
It's an acronym.

41:30.880 --> 41:33.840
B-O-Y-L-E.

41:33.840 --> 41:36.720
That's Fintan Boyle's skull
she's smashing!

41:36.720 --> 41:42.400
<i>Before Our Young Lives End.</i>

41:42.400 --> 41:45.440
Aunt Beth said the woman
was driving a 4x4.

41:47.920 --> 41:51.600
That's not a 4x4.

41:51.600 --> 41:53.680
Number plates must be stolen.

41:53.680 --> 41:55.720
We find her, we find Robert Cox.

42:02.200 --> 42:04.040
Hey, Liv.

42:04.040 --> 42:05.840
Hey, Cat. What's up?

42:05.840 --> 42:08.200
I'm looking for a van or an SUV

42:08.200 --> 42:10.360
that's been rammed by a car.

42:10.360 --> 42:12.200
I need you to call me
if one comes in.

42:12.200 --> 42:13.960
Yeah, I can do that.

42:13.960 --> 42:16.040
- Cheers.
All right, see you, Cat.

42:39.840 --> 42:42.360
Well, I don't much fancy
wading about in there.

42:42.360 --> 42:43.760
Me neither.

42:43.760 --> 42:45.200
She's definitely up
to something.

42:55.080 --> 42:57.200
<i>And the artist known as Yetao</i>

42:57.200 --> 43:00.440
<i>wasn't the only one
who was up to something.</i>

43:00.440 --> 43:02.880
<i>Una Lowe had waited until dark</i>

43:02.880 --> 43:05.440
<i>to take care
of some rather urgent...</i>

43:08.040 --> 43:09.760
<i>recycling.</i>

43:24.400 --> 43:29.440
<i>Even as Matilda decided to save
her energy for the day ahead,</i>

43:29.440 --> 43:33.960
<i>little did she know that
it would be a day with not one,</i>

43:33.960 --> 43:36.880
<i>but two murders to solve.</i>
