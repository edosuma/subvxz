WEBVTT

00:11.219 --> 00:12.971
<i>Let's assess, shall we?</i>

00:13.680 --> 00:16.057
<i>Bag over my head</i>
<i>for optimal disorientation,</i>

00:17.142 --> 00:20.228
<i>wrists tied tight enough</i>
<i>to cut off circulation,</i>

00:20.311 --> 00:22.689
<i>and no idea if I'm going to live or die.</i>

00:24.357 --> 00:26.067
<i>It's definitely my kind of party.</i>

00:26.901 --> 00:29.612
Who dares breach our inner sanctum?

00:29.696 --> 00:31.322
You can take the mask off, Bianca.

00:33.491 --> 00:35.452
<i>And just like that, my hopes were dashed</i>

00:35.535 --> 00:37.871
<i>against the rocks</i>
<i>of bitter disappointment.</i>

00:37.954 --> 00:40.206
<i>My foe was no psychotic killer.</i>

00:40.290 --> 00:42.459
<i>More like a bunch of high school clowns.</i>

00:42.542 --> 00:44.419
Wait, I preferred you with it on.

00:44.502 --> 00:46.713
-How did you get down here?
-Rowan showed me.

00:48.006 --> 00:48.840
Left pocket.

00:53.595 --> 00:55.847
I tracked the watermark to the Poe statue.

00:55.930 --> 00:58.308
-Then I solved the riddle.
-Wait, there's a riddle?

00:58.391 --> 00:59.934
I thought we just snapped twice.

01:00.435 --> 01:02.103
Well, aren't you
the brightest in the bunch?

01:02.687 --> 01:05.023
The Nightshades are an elite social club.

01:05.106 --> 01:06.191
Emphasis on elite.

01:06.274 --> 01:09.903
We have roof parties, campouts,
the occasional midnight skinny-dip.

01:09.986 --> 01:11.571
And Yoko's an amateur mixologist.

01:11.654 --> 01:14.866
She makes a killer virgin mojito.
It can get pretty wild.

01:15.658 --> 01:17.660
Wow. Do you guys even have a bedtime?

01:18.203 --> 01:20.371
Last I heard,
the Nightshades had been disbanded.

01:20.455 --> 01:25.043
Yeah, the group kind of lost its charter
30 years ago after some normie kid died.

01:25.126 --> 01:26.836
But we have
a lot of wealthy alumni,

01:26.920 --> 01:29.714
so Weems looks the other way
as long as nobody makes any waves.

01:29.798 --> 01:32.842
-Someone like Rowan?
-We booted that loser last semester.

01:34.177 --> 01:36.346
Question is,
what are we gonna do with her?

01:37.764 --> 01:39.933
Only members are allowed in this library.

01:43.895 --> 01:46.314
-I say we invite her to pledge.
-What?

01:47.065 --> 01:47.982
She is a legacy.

01:48.066 --> 01:51.736
After the crap she pulled in the Poe Cup,
there's no way in hell.

01:51.820 --> 01:54.697
We talk about not making waves?
She's a tsunami.

01:54.781 --> 01:58.118
Just because I beat you at your own game?
Let me save you the trouble.

01:58.201 --> 01:59.828
I'm not interested in joining.

02:00.411 --> 02:01.996
You're seriously turning us down?

02:02.080 --> 02:03.289
Can you believe it?

02:04.415 --> 02:05.250
Untie her.

02:05.333 --> 02:06.835
I freed myself five minutes ago.

02:12.841 --> 02:14.843
Do you want a matching black eye?

02:23.393 --> 02:25.895
It's amateurs like you
who give kidnapping a bad name.

02:47.542 --> 02:49.794
<i>There were</i>
<i>so many threads to my investigation,</i>

02:49.878 --> 02:51.171
<i>I could weave a burial shroud.</i>

02:51.754 --> 02:55.341
<i>I still have no idea how Rowan</i>
<i>mysteriously rose from the dead.</i>

02:55.425 --> 02:57.468
<i>Or why that monster is prowling the woods.</i>

02:58.469 --> 03:01.556
<i>But right now,</i>
<i>nothing intrigues me more than this book.</i>

03:02.223 --> 03:05.351
<i>If I'm going to be responsible</i>
<i>for Nevermore's demise,</i>

03:05.435 --> 03:06.769
<i>the question is,</i>

03:07.353 --> 03:10.148
<i>why am I sharing</i>
<i>this apocalypse with a pilgrim?</i>

03:15.945 --> 03:18.448
All students will report
for their volunteer jobs

03:18.531 --> 03:19.866
at 10:00 a.m. sharp,

03:19.949 --> 03:22.076
followed by a community lunch at 1:00.

03:22.160 --> 03:28.208
As you know, this year Outreach Day
culminates in a very special event,

03:28.291 --> 03:31.920
the dedication of a new memorial statue
in the town square,

03:32.503 --> 03:35.965
which will also include
performances by Nevermore students.

03:37.759 --> 03:40.053
As representatives of our school,

03:40.136 --> 03:43.431
I trust you will all
put your best face forward.

03:43.973 --> 03:45.350
-Yeah.
-Yes!

03:53.191 --> 03:55.443
Yes! I got Pilgrim World.

03:56.027 --> 03:58.112
I have natural people skills
and a love of performing,

03:58.196 --> 03:59.906
so it's kind of the obvi choice.

04:00.406 --> 04:01.407
What'd you get?

04:02.992 --> 04:04.744
Uriah's Heap, whatever that is.

04:04.827 --> 04:07.705
Ew. It's this weird, creepy antique store.

04:08.539 --> 04:09.499
You'll love it though.

04:10.667 --> 04:13.753
I'm crossing my claws Ajax and I
will be outreaching together.

04:14.254 --> 04:16.297
Oh my God, I got the Weathervane.

04:16.381 --> 04:18.258
Dude, trade with me.
Come on, trade with me!

04:19.717 --> 04:22.095
Wednesday, don't worry about your cello.

04:22.178 --> 04:24.889
I'll have it brought
to the town square this afternoon.

04:25.723 --> 04:26.557
My cello?

04:26.641 --> 04:29.394
I caught your rooftop serenade
the other night.

04:30.270 --> 04:31.187
Impressive.

04:31.938 --> 04:35.316
I volunteered you to accompany
the Jericho High School marching band

04:35.400 --> 04:36.234
at the ceremony.

04:37.026 --> 04:41.489
I'm sure it won't be too challenging
to play an uplifting Fleetwood Mac melody.

04:42.365 --> 04:45.118
As long as you promise
to hang me as a witch afterwards.

05:01.259 --> 05:04.721
-Why are you staring at a blank wall?
-It wasn't blank last Outreach Day.

05:05.722 --> 05:08.433
Are you still stewing
because I rejected your invitation?

05:09.058 --> 05:10.476
I did go out on a limb for you.

05:10.560 --> 05:14.689
Please. I'm just cannon fodder in whatever
cold war you're waging with Bianca.

05:14.772 --> 05:17.025
-I have more pressing issues.
-Like what?

05:17.108 --> 05:19.235
Tracking down the monster
that killed your roommate.

05:19.319 --> 05:21.321
Oh my god.
For the last time, Rowan was expelled.

05:21.404 --> 05:23.614
-Everyone saw him leave.
-Have you spoken to him since?

05:25.283 --> 05:27.744
I texted him a few times,
but I never heard back.

05:27.827 --> 05:30.204
I just figured he wanted
Nevermore in his rearview mirror.

05:30.288 --> 05:31.331
Or he's dead.

05:31.414 --> 05:33.875
I don't know why you care.
It's not like you knew the guy.

05:33.958 --> 05:36.044
I'm not sure why you care so little.

05:36.127 --> 05:40.089
People can dismiss me and make a million
other excuses, but I'm not gonna stop.

05:41.007 --> 05:44.052
Oh, great. I guess you can
add "thief" to your resume.

05:44.135 --> 05:47.263
I don't know what the big deal is about
an old Nightshade's journal anyways.

05:47.347 --> 05:50.099
You didn't seem surprised
when I showed you this last night.

05:50.183 --> 05:51.893
You've seen it before, haven't you?

05:52.727 --> 05:55.438
Yeah. A couple days
before the Harvest Festival.

05:55.521 --> 05:56.814
It was open on Rowan's desk.

05:56.898 --> 05:59.817
I assumed he stole it after
we kicked him out of the Nightshades.

06:00.318 --> 06:03.654
Then I confronted him about it,
and he kind of went ballistic on me.

06:04.238 --> 06:05.948
-It is unbelievable--
-Shut up!

06:06.032 --> 06:07.325
-How can you?
-You're crazy!

06:09.494 --> 06:12.205
He threw you against the wall
with his telekinesis.

06:13.456 --> 06:14.499
Yeah.

06:15.541 --> 06:16.751
How did you know that?

06:17.460 --> 06:18.544
Lucky guess.

06:20.171 --> 06:24.217
It's weird that you're in this.
This journal is like, what, 30 years old?

06:24.300 --> 06:26.260
What's Crackstone doing
in the picture with you?

06:26.344 --> 06:27.595
You know who that is?

06:28.179 --> 06:29.430
Yeah, it's Joseph Crackstone.

06:29.514 --> 06:31.599
He's, like, Jericho's founding father.

06:31.682 --> 06:32.934
He's a big deal around here.

06:33.017 --> 06:34.185
Yeah, look.

06:35.144 --> 06:36.020
That's him.

06:47.156 --> 06:48.699
-Sheriff.
-Yeah.

06:48.783 --> 06:50.410
You remember my son, Lucas?

06:50.493 --> 06:54.122
I sure do. I ran into him and his buddies
last week at the Weathervane.

06:55.415 --> 06:56.749
I'd better get to work.

06:56.833 --> 06:58.876
Hey, no trouble today. You got it?

07:04.424 --> 07:06.175
Hey, don't look too excited.

07:06.259 --> 07:08.970
Those outcast kids might think
we're happy to have 'em.

07:09.053 --> 07:12.098
We got something lurking in the woods,
connected to that school.

07:12.181 --> 07:15.226
Come on, would you stop
pointing fingers at Nevermore?

07:15.309 --> 07:17.437
You know how much Jericho
depends on that place.

07:17.520 --> 07:21.524
Who do you think pays for our roads,
our parks… even your salary?

07:21.607 --> 07:25.153
I'm just doing my job, looking out
for the well-being of our town, boss.

07:25.236 --> 07:27.155
Don't lecture me, Donovan.

07:27.238 --> 07:29.657
Before the good citizens of Jericho
elected me mayor,

07:29.740 --> 07:31.284
I used to wear that badge, remember?

07:32.285 --> 07:35.788
Mm-hmm. You never struck me
as much of a history buff back then.

07:35.872 --> 07:38.583
If it's good for business,
then it's good for Jericho.

07:38.666 --> 07:40.751
Especially if your business
is Pilgrim World.

07:40.835 --> 07:41.836
Hey.

07:42.837 --> 07:45.381
Just find the damn bear
and take care of it.

07:47.592 --> 07:48.509
Mmm.

07:48.593 --> 07:50.344
All right. Everyone take a seat.

07:50.428 --> 07:52.638
We have a special announcement.

07:55.725 --> 07:57.894
Welcome, welcome, Nevermore Academy.

07:57.977 --> 08:01.814
Now, on behalf of
the entire Jericho community,

08:01.898 --> 08:04.859
we are so, so pleased
to have you all here today.

08:04.942 --> 08:09.071
Your generosity and hard work
are truly… outreachous!

08:11.449 --> 08:15.953
Okay, everyone. We'll see you
back here at one o'clock for lunch. Enjoy!

08:23.586 --> 08:24.587
Enid.

08:25.546 --> 08:27.256
Switch volunteer assignments.

08:27.340 --> 08:30.426
What? No.
Uriah's Heap is definitely not my bag.

08:30.510 --> 08:33.095
It's an emergency.
I need to check out Pilgrim World.

08:33.179 --> 08:35.598
But Wednesday, this is not a fair trade.

08:35.681 --> 08:39.227
Why would I agree to spend the entire day
at some dumpy emporium of crapola?

08:39.310 --> 08:41.604
Because Ajax is volunteering there.

08:41.687 --> 08:43.189
Thing sneaked a peek at his assignment.

08:43.272 --> 08:44.649
-But if you're not interested--
-No!

08:45.608 --> 08:47.902
Oh my God, thank you. You're the best!

09:06.462 --> 09:09.048
Welcome to Pilgrim World!

09:09.131 --> 09:12.134
Witch trials every day!

09:12.218 --> 09:14.178
Two o'clock, four o'clock!

09:14.262 --> 09:16.097
Hey, man! Woman!

09:22.103 --> 09:24.480
Hey, Wednesday,
want to grab a Hummers group photo?

09:26.732 --> 09:27.567
Guess not.

09:28.359 --> 09:31.988
Good morrow, my young Nevermore kin.

09:32.697 --> 09:35.700
I am Mistress Arlene. A real OC.

09:37.118 --> 09:38.536
Original colonist.

09:38.619 --> 09:42.873
Now prithee, put your cell phones
on vibrate and make haste,

09:43.624 --> 09:49.171
for you are about to travel back in time
to the year of our Lord 1625,

09:49.255 --> 09:52.258
to Jericho's first pilgrim settlement.

09:59.223 --> 10:00.057
Yonder.

10:00.141 --> 10:02.476
Behold, the meeting house.

10:02.560 --> 10:05.271
Inside is a collection of artifacts

10:05.354 --> 10:09.066
related to Jericho's most beloved
and pious founder,

10:09.150 --> 10:10.568
Joseph Crackstone.

10:11.068 --> 10:15.740
And beyond is our privy,
America's first gender-neutral restroom.

10:15.823 --> 10:17.158
I haveth a query.

10:17.241 --> 10:18.701
Pray, be quick, child.

10:18.784 --> 10:20.036
In the meeting house,

10:20.119 --> 10:22.288
which of Joseph Crackstone's artifacts
are on display?

10:22.371 --> 10:24.290
It is truly a treasure trove,

10:24.373 --> 10:29.503
including original farm tools, tableware,
even the Crackstone family chamber pot.

10:29.587 --> 10:32.256
Sounds fascinating.
I volunteer to work in there.

10:32.340 --> 10:34.967
Pray, no. That exhibit is being renovated.

10:35.051 --> 10:40.473
Today, thou will all be working
at the beating heart of Pilgrim World.

10:41.098 --> 10:42.683
Ye olde fudgery!

10:44.101 --> 10:46.020
"Ye Olde Fudgery?"

10:46.103 --> 10:47.980
More like ye olde diabetes in a box.

10:48.064 --> 10:50.483
Volunteers, prick up thine ears.

10:51.567 --> 10:55.404
Fudge is the lifeblood
of our humble community.

10:55.488 --> 10:57.281
And samples equal sales,

10:57.365 --> 11:03.079
so grab a uniform and a box
and make our forefathers proud.

11:03.663 --> 11:05.289
Are these for muzzling tourists?

11:15.883 --> 11:18.803
-I'm pretty sure it's dead.

11:18.886 --> 11:20.930
See the tire treads across its tail?

11:21.013 --> 11:24.058
Local artist scooped that fella up
right here on Route 22.

11:24.141 --> 11:27.520
You're telling me someone
actually goes out and collects roadkill

11:27.603 --> 11:28.938
and turns them into that?

11:29.689 --> 11:30.898
Can't keep them on the shelves.

11:30.981 --> 11:33.359
Got a whole section
dedicated to these beauties.

11:33.442 --> 11:35.152
Squirrels, skunks, snakes,

11:35.236 --> 11:36.612
and my personal fave…

11:39.281 --> 11:41.158
family of ferrets at a clambake.

11:42.159 --> 11:43.119
Too cute.

11:43.202 --> 11:45.079
You two want to make yourself useful?

11:45.162 --> 11:48.124
I reckon they could use
a good brush with a Tangle Teezer.

11:48.207 --> 11:49.208
It freshens up the fur.

11:51.377 --> 11:53.504
Maybe we can do that after, like, a…

11:53.587 --> 11:55.005
An extended coffee break.

11:55.840 --> 11:56.799
Right, Ajax?

11:57.800 --> 12:02.388
Uh, yeah. We'll hit the Weathervane.
Want us to pick you up something?

12:03.431 --> 12:06.058
No need to pay
for that overpriced hipster swill.

12:06.559 --> 12:07.768
I'm brewing chaga.

12:09.145 --> 12:10.229
It's my own blend.

12:11.397 --> 12:12.356
Mushroom tea.

12:13.107 --> 12:15.192
I foraged the little buggers myself.

12:15.276 --> 12:17.820
Better get teasing. You're in for a treat.

12:23.242 --> 12:24.326
Okay.

12:24.410 --> 12:25.411
This is good.

12:25.494 --> 12:26.787
-Delicious.
-You're welcome.

12:26.871 --> 12:30.708
Enjoy your "authentic"
pilgrim fudge made with cacao beans

12:30.791 --> 12:33.419
procured by the oppressed
indigenous people of the Amazon.

12:33.502 --> 12:34.462
What?

12:34.545 --> 12:40.468
All proceeds go to uphold this pathetic
whitewashing of American history.

12:41.260 --> 12:45.139
Also, fudge wasn't invented
for another 258 years.

12:46.474 --> 12:47.850
Any takers?

12:48.434 --> 12:49.769
No, no, no.

13:01.947 --> 13:02.948
Ugh.

13:09.038 --> 13:10.790
Check out this greedy little freak.

13:11.373 --> 13:13.250
Please, I need to get back to the…

13:20.716 --> 13:21.759
Whoa, yuck!

13:21.842 --> 13:22.843
Yuck, man.

13:23.260 --> 13:24.136
Come here!

13:26.555 --> 13:27.640
Get in there!

13:28.933 --> 13:29.934
Howdy, Pilgrims.

13:33.813 --> 13:36.315
-Let him go.
-You want to end up in the stocks too?

13:36.398 --> 13:39.318
Remember what happened
the last time we did this dance?

13:46.826 --> 13:47.743
Get her!

13:58.128 --> 13:59.797
Are you two still here?

13:59.880 --> 14:02.091
I can't get into more trouble with my dad.

14:03.008 --> 14:04.426
No, wait!

14:05.177 --> 14:06.136
Lucas.

14:08.013 --> 14:09.306
Let's get you cleaned up.

14:15.312 --> 14:16.438
Principal Weems.

14:16.939 --> 14:20.401
Well, it looks like another
successful Outreach Day is upon us.

14:22.236 --> 14:23.362
And, uh…

14:23.445 --> 14:27.658
thank you for your generous donation
to my re-election campaign.

14:28.993 --> 14:33.247
Consider it a token
of our ongoing cooperation.

14:36.458 --> 14:39.086
Apparently everyone
is off to their assignments.

14:39.169 --> 14:40.838
And so far no incidents.

14:41.714 --> 14:45.009
Mayor Walker,
I'd like you to meet Marilyn Thornhill.

14:45.092 --> 14:49.513
In the spirit of outreach,
she's Nevermore's first normie teacher.

14:49.597 --> 14:52.349
Well, the pleasure is all mine.

14:53.601 --> 14:55.728
Hey, have we, uh… Have we met before?

14:56.312 --> 14:58.898
Not officially,
but I see you in here every morning.

14:59.481 --> 15:03.527
You're always tucked into that back booth
when I come for my daily matcha latte.

15:03.611 --> 15:04.904
I knew it!

15:04.987 --> 15:06.906
Miss Thornhill, please keep me posted,

15:06.989 --> 15:10.618
especially about
a certain pig-tailed upstart.

15:11.911 --> 15:12.745
Right.

15:18.292 --> 15:20.419
Nobody's ever stood up for me before.

15:21.170 --> 15:22.671
You said Hummers stick together.

15:22.755 --> 15:25.341
I know this might come as a shock,

15:25.424 --> 15:27.551
but I don't have any friends.

15:31.555 --> 15:32.973
You remind me of my brother,

15:33.724 --> 15:36.393
sans the desire to strangle him
every waking moment.

15:38.729 --> 15:39.563
Now follow me.

15:39.647 --> 15:42.107
I need to know more about this Crackstone.

15:42.191 --> 15:43.984
We have a meeting house to break into.

15:49.657 --> 15:52.618
-Give me your retainer.
-What? Why? Your teeth are really good.

15:52.701 --> 15:54.828
Not as straight or white as Enid's, but--

15:54.912 --> 15:55.746
Hand it over!

15:57.623 --> 15:59.500
What if Mistress Arlene catches us?

15:59.583 --> 16:01.543
Hive code, deny everything.

16:01.627 --> 16:03.253
That's not hive code!

16:03.337 --> 16:04.838
What's the big deal anyway?

16:04.922 --> 16:07.466
The fudge is definitely
the best thing about this place.

16:07.549 --> 16:09.093
Stop talking. Keep watch.

16:18.394 --> 16:21.855
<i>My grandmother once told me</i>
<i>secrets are like zombies…</i>

16:23.899 --> 16:25.109
<i>they never truly die.</i>

16:27.695 --> 16:30.322
<i>I'm not sure what secret</i>
<i>Crackstone is hiding,</i>

16:30.823 --> 16:34.410
<i>but I have a strange feeling</i>
<i>the answers to my future lie in the past.</i>

16:41.291 --> 16:44.003
<i>The Old Meeting House, </i>1625.

16:55.305 --> 16:57.474
Thing, this is the girl from my vision.

16:58.851 --> 17:00.477
She's even holding the same book.

17:01.061 --> 17:03.522
That black one she had
outside Crackstone's crypt.

17:11.363 --> 17:12.573
How now.

17:12.656 --> 17:14.116
Your Nevermore sister,

17:14.199 --> 17:16.493
the one with the dark eyes
and the sour face,

17:16.577 --> 17:17.745
where has she hithered?

17:17.828 --> 17:19.496
You mean Wednesday Addams?

17:19.997 --> 17:23.500
Knowing her,
she's hithered somewhere she shan't be.

17:32.051 --> 17:33.177
This is the book!

17:38.974 --> 17:40.768
<i>Codex Umbrarum.</i>

17:40.851 --> 17:42.770
That's Latin for "Book of Shadows."

17:45.647 --> 17:47.775
Great. It's a fake.

17:50.152 --> 17:53.363
I don't know who Etsy is,
but I doubt she was an outcast settler.

17:55.741 --> 17:58.327
Just what the fudge
are you doing in here, missy?

17:58.410 --> 18:00.204
Mistress Arlene. How now?

18:00.287 --> 18:01.747
How now, indeed.

18:01.830 --> 18:04.374
I proclaimed the meeting house
is under repair.

18:04.458 --> 18:06.376
I know thoust heard me.

18:06.460 --> 18:08.087
I told her the door was unlocked

18:08.170 --> 18:10.339
and you were dying
to learn more about Crackstone.

18:10.422 --> 18:13.175
Yes, and this display case
was already open.

18:14.510 --> 18:16.428
-That book's a replica.
-You don't say.

18:16.512 --> 18:19.348
The original was stolen last month
during the two o'clock witch trial.

18:19.431 --> 18:22.309
It was probably
the only authentic thing you have in here,

18:22.392 --> 18:24.311
yet you still charge $29.95 a ticket?

18:24.394 --> 18:25.771
Hold thy tongue.

18:27.106 --> 18:28.440
I'm reassigning you both.

18:28.941 --> 18:30.317
To fudge-churning duty.

18:31.360 --> 18:34.863
The original meeting house,
the one in that painting, where is it?

18:37.241 --> 18:38.826
How the hell should I know?

18:38.909 --> 18:41.328
I only moved here
from Scottsdale in April.

18:52.422 --> 18:53.507
Can I help you?

19:06.270 --> 19:08.814
Ooh. That gives me the heebie-jeebies.

19:09.857 --> 19:10.858
I don't know.

19:11.525 --> 19:14.278
You think squirrels and rats
could ever work out?

19:14.778 --> 19:17.531
I mean,
they're two totally different species.

19:18.615 --> 19:19.867
Oh, yeah.

19:19.950 --> 19:20.909
I mean, totally.

19:21.702 --> 19:22.703
Why not?

19:22.786 --> 19:24.788
They have more in common than you think.

19:24.872 --> 19:28.167
Most people are scared of them,
so it would just be us… them…

19:28.250 --> 19:29.376
against the world.

19:30.252 --> 19:31.753
Wow.

19:31.837 --> 19:33.422
That was… deep.

19:35.591 --> 19:36.884
You know, by the way,

19:36.967 --> 19:40.304
I totally dug the way you scratched out
the bottom of our boat at Poe Cup.

19:40.387 --> 19:41.638
It was pretty badass.

19:42.222 --> 19:44.725
Thanks. You're not mad you lost?

19:45.309 --> 19:47.019
I was just doing a solid for Xavier.

19:47.102 --> 19:49.646
I mean, he's my boy,
but he's super competitive.

19:49.730 --> 19:51.356
Seems so laid-back.

19:51.940 --> 19:54.193
Bro's got a darker side
most people don't see.

19:54.693 --> 19:57.654
I think it's because his dad is…
well, you know, famous.

19:58.530 --> 19:59.823
All that pressure.

20:00.949 --> 20:04.536
You realize this is, like,
the longest conversation we've ever had?

20:07.915 --> 20:09.917
Gorgons are taught not to engage.

20:11.251 --> 20:13.879
You know, I don't want
to accidentally stone someone.

20:17.257 --> 20:19.218
I'm not afraid of being stoned by you.

20:19.301 --> 20:20.844
It's just temporary.

20:21.762 --> 20:22.846
Really?

20:24.514 --> 20:25.557
You mean that?

20:25.641 --> 20:26.683
One hundo!

20:28.060 --> 20:31.313
So, um, I was thinking of sneaking
behind the greenhouse tonight.

20:31.897 --> 20:33.273
Supposed to be a blue moon.

20:33.357 --> 20:36.235
Only happens once every 23 years
or something crazy.

20:36.735 --> 20:38.904
Should get a killer view from there.

20:39.488 --> 20:41.365
Cool. Hey, have fun.

20:42.741 --> 20:45.619
You know that's where
a lot of kids go to hook up, right?

20:45.702 --> 20:47.621
-I mean, it could get awkward.
-Ajax!

20:47.704 --> 20:51.500
I just spent all morning flirting
and hinting and trying to act cute

20:51.583 --> 20:54.419
while brushing some roadkill
just so you would ask me on a date.

20:55.796 --> 20:57.339
Oh!

20:57.422 --> 20:59.383
Oh! That's what you were doing.

21:00.175 --> 21:03.595
I kind of wondered when you spent
so long brushing that opossum's tail.

21:05.305 --> 21:09.851
Hey, so you want to meet up
behind the greenhouse tonight?

21:09.935 --> 21:10.769
Yes.

21:11.728 --> 21:12.896
Yes, I do.

21:13.605 --> 21:17.985
Ajax, can you help me move
the badger dentist to the front window?

21:18.068 --> 21:20.696
Yes! I can't believe he asked.

21:28.203 --> 21:31.206
I thought you were
supposed to be at Pilgrim World.

21:31.290 --> 21:33.625
I deserted it
while my sanity was still intact.

21:33.709 --> 21:34.626
Oh yeah?

21:35.544 --> 21:36.837
You want a coffee?

21:36.920 --> 21:39.715
It's one of the many perks
of this wonderful assignment.

21:39.798 --> 21:40.924
I'm actually here for Tyler.

21:43.510 --> 21:44.553
I told you he was bad news.

21:44.636 --> 21:45.637
Twice.

21:46.138 --> 21:48.181
But who I speak to is my business.

21:53.770 --> 21:54.730
You rang?

21:59.901 --> 22:00.819
Want the usual?

22:00.902 --> 22:01.862
And some help.

22:02.946 --> 22:06.575
You know the original pilgrim
meeting house, the one from the 1600s?

22:07.242 --> 22:08.702
You know if it's still around?

22:08.785 --> 22:12.205
What's left is out in Cobham Woods,
but it's pretty much a ruin.

22:12.789 --> 22:13.790
Show me.

22:15.000 --> 22:16.209
Uh…

22:16.293 --> 22:19.046
There, but, look, it's kind of sketchy.

22:20.130 --> 22:22.299
Squatters and meth heads
use that place as a crash pad.

22:22.382 --> 22:24.676
My dad has it cleared out
every couple weeks.

22:24.760 --> 22:25.761
What's this about?

22:26.511 --> 22:27.346
Nothing.

22:29.264 --> 22:31.767
You're becoming obsessed
with this monster in the woods thing.

22:31.850 --> 22:35.437
Would you rather I develop
an obsession with horses and boy bands?

22:35.520 --> 22:36.563
Thank you for the help.

22:38.023 --> 22:41.777
Hey, listen, the ruins
are kind of tricky to find.

22:41.860 --> 22:44.321
I could take you this afternoon.
My shift ends at 2:00.

22:44.404 --> 22:46.531
Principal Weems would hang,
draw and quarter me

22:46.615 --> 22:48.450
if I miss the big statue dedication.

22:48.950 --> 22:51.870
And as enticing as that sounds,
I'd prefer to keep a low profile.

22:51.953 --> 22:54.498
Besides, I know my way
around the great outdoors.

22:54.581 --> 22:56.500
Don't tell me you were a Girl Scout.

22:56.583 --> 22:58.835
I could eat Girl Scouts for breakfast.

22:59.544 --> 23:01.213
I have an uncle
who went to prison for that.

23:33.120 --> 23:34.746
I was expecting more too.

23:37.958 --> 23:39.793
Who you talking to, little girl?

23:41.795 --> 23:43.880
Use "little" and "girl"
to address me again

23:43.964 --> 23:45.882
and I can't guarantee your safety.

23:45.966 --> 23:47.926
This is my place. Get out!

23:48.009 --> 23:49.219
Thing, a hand here?

23:56.309 --> 23:57.185
Hey!

24:04.192 --> 24:05.068
Hey!

24:05.652 --> 24:07.696
Get off! Get off me!

24:14.202 --> 24:15.454
There's nothing here.

24:19.124 --> 24:21.084
No, I can't just touch something.

24:21.626 --> 24:24.004
My visions seem to happen spontaneously.

24:26.465 --> 24:29.426
I would rather dye my hair pink
than ask my mother for advice.

24:31.595 --> 24:33.680
Oh, you want me to prove it to you?

24:34.973 --> 24:35.849
No.

24:39.603 --> 24:40.562
Nothing.

24:41.146 --> 24:43.565
Ah, I bet this will give us
some real insight.

24:49.863 --> 24:52.324
My visions are about
as predictable as shark attacks.

25:02.042 --> 25:04.252
Burn her!

25:04.336 --> 25:05.629
Burn her!

25:05.712 --> 25:07.672
Burn her!

25:07.756 --> 25:08.882
Burn her!

25:08.965 --> 25:10.008
Devil spawn!

25:12.594 --> 25:14.179
Devil spawn!

25:15.514 --> 25:16.556
Beast!

25:18.892 --> 25:19.726
Witch!

25:21.561 --> 25:22.729
Repent!

25:25.899 --> 25:26.775
Begone!

25:26.858 --> 25:28.735
-Witch!
-Stand aside!

25:30.529 --> 25:32.030
Goody Addams!

25:33.281 --> 25:36.576
You have been judged
before God and found guilty.

25:37.911 --> 25:39.204
You are a witch,

25:39.287 --> 25:40.539
a sorceress,

25:41.289 --> 25:43.708
Lucifer's mistress herself.

25:44.459 --> 25:46.253
For your sins,

25:46.336 --> 25:48.505
you will burn this night,

25:48.588 --> 25:51.716
and suffer the flames of eternal hellfire.

25:51.800 --> 25:53.093
I am innocent.

25:53.677 --> 25:55.971
It is you, Joseph Crackstone,
that should be tried.

25:56.763 --> 25:58.056
We were here before you,

25:58.765 --> 26:01.226
living in harmony
with nature and the native folk.

26:01.309 --> 26:03.061
But you have stolen our land.

26:03.645 --> 26:07.232
You have slaughtered the innocent.
You have robbed us of our peaceful spirit.

26:08.858 --> 26:11.653
You are the true monster. All of you!

26:15.031 --> 26:16.241
Punish her!

26:18.243 --> 26:20.203
The Devil ne'er sent such a demon.

26:22.914 --> 26:25.041
And I will send you back!

26:25.125 --> 26:26.167
No!

26:34.634 --> 26:37.554
You are abominations in the Devil's grip!

26:38.430 --> 26:41.641
I will not stop
till I have expunged this New World

26:41.725 --> 26:43.727
of every outcast.

26:43.810 --> 26:45.895
Godless creatures!

27:02.746 --> 27:04.706
Set it ablaze!

27:20.472 --> 27:21.514
Mother!

27:22.307 --> 27:23.141
Mother.

27:28.188 --> 27:29.356
There's no time, child.

27:31.399 --> 27:33.068
Leave me. Save yourself.

27:33.151 --> 27:35.278
He's chained us all to the floor.

27:42.243 --> 27:44.120
I shan't leave without you.

27:45.080 --> 27:46.915
Run. Avenge us.

27:47.582 --> 27:50.502
Find the others
and save our future.

27:51.086 --> 27:53.672
Please. My sweet lamb.

27:53.755 --> 27:56.508
Run. Run as fast as you can.

27:56.591 --> 27:58.385
You are our only hope.

28:33.253 --> 28:35.672
He won't stop until he's killed us all!

28:37.090 --> 28:37.966
He's here.

28:41.261 --> 28:43.263
There will be no escape for you.

28:48.143 --> 28:49.602
Thing, I saw her!

28:49.686 --> 28:51.187
The girl from my visions.

28:52.355 --> 28:53.857
Her name is Goody Addams,

28:54.733 --> 28:57.694
and I believe she's my ancestor
from 400 years ago.

29:15.170 --> 29:16.838
Must've been the bearded man from earlier.

29:24.387 --> 29:25.722
Come on! Come on!

29:45.492 --> 29:47.160
The monster's human.

29:48.453 --> 29:49.996
What the hell are you doing?

29:51.247 --> 29:53.458
-I was following the monster.
-You saw it?

29:54.083 --> 29:56.294
It's here? Do you have
a death wish or something?

29:57.295 --> 29:58.505
What are you doing here?

29:58.588 --> 30:01.382
I overheard you say you were
checking out the old meeting house.

30:01.466 --> 30:03.051
It's lucky I showed up when I did.

30:03.635 --> 30:04.969
I did learn one thing.

30:05.595 --> 30:06.971
The monster is human.

30:07.597 --> 30:09.974
Its tracks turned from monster prints
to human ones.

30:10.809 --> 30:12.185
Show me.

30:18.566 --> 30:20.276
The rain washed them all away.

30:22.654 --> 30:23.780
I know what I saw.

30:23.863 --> 30:26.115
-I'm trying to keep an open mind.
-How big of you.

30:26.199 --> 30:27.909
I do think you might be right about Rowan.

30:27.992 --> 30:30.787
-Why the sudden change of heart?

30:31.287 --> 30:35.083
I texted him again today. I said
maybe we could meet over spring break

30:35.166 --> 30:37.293
and go snowboarding like we did last year.

30:38.086 --> 30:41.506
This time he texted right back,
said he wouldn't be able to make it.

30:41.589 --> 30:43.967
Only you never went
snowboarding last year.

30:45.510 --> 30:47.804
Part of me wanted
to blame his recent weirdness.

30:48.304 --> 30:50.390
I didn't want to think
something bad had happened.

30:50.473 --> 30:52.934
The cover-up is
always worse than the crime.

30:53.017 --> 30:54.727
Now I need you to be honest with me.

30:55.770 --> 30:58.231
Why'd you come out to
the old meeting house in the first place?

30:58.982 --> 31:01.150
I was trying to learn more
about Crackstone.

31:01.901 --> 31:03.695
Figure out how he's connected to this.

31:04.279 --> 31:07.323
Yeah, you were trying to use
your psychic abilities, right?

31:07.407 --> 31:09.075
What makes you think I have any?

31:10.034 --> 31:12.161
Lucky guess. When did they start?

31:13.288 --> 31:14.664
About a year ago.

31:16.583 --> 31:19.210
When they happen,
it feels like I'm touching live wire.

31:20.253 --> 31:22.088
I usually enjoy that sensation.

31:23.131 --> 31:25.758
Yeah, but you can't control it
and that freaks you out.

31:26.676 --> 31:27.802
My dad's a psychic.

31:28.303 --> 31:29.137
Vincent Thorpe.

31:29.971 --> 31:31.890
My brother's his number one fan.

31:31.973 --> 31:33.808
Watched his Vegas Special so many times

31:33.892 --> 31:36.394
I'm surprised it's not
imprinted on his eyeballs.

31:37.478 --> 31:39.522
So I've lived with
a self-described master.

31:39.606 --> 31:42.859
The first thing he'll tell you
is that visions can't be trusted.

31:42.942 --> 31:44.444
They only show one part of the picture.

31:44.527 --> 31:47.739
I saw Joseph Crackstone in front of me
as clearly as I'm seeing you now.

31:48.656 --> 31:50.658
He gathered all the outcasts
in the meeting house

31:50.742 --> 31:51.993
and burned them alive.

31:52.076 --> 31:53.703
Okay, he was a sadistic asshole.

31:54.579 --> 31:57.040
It was 400 years ago.
It's got nothing to do with now.

31:57.123 --> 31:58.333
But what if it does?

31:59.167 --> 32:02.712
You saw Rowan's drawing.
Crackstone was standing in the quad.

32:02.795 --> 32:05.965
You're creating a story in your head
and using visions to back it up.

32:06.049 --> 32:09.218
-They're telling you what you want to see.
-Are you mansplaining my power?

32:10.637 --> 32:12.847
All I'm saying is my dad, the expert,

32:12.931 --> 32:15.808
would warn you that psychic ability
isn't rooted in logic.

32:16.601 --> 32:17.977
It's triggered by emotions.

32:19.187 --> 32:21.981
And let's be honest,
emotion isn't your strong suit.

32:25.568 --> 32:27.153
I believe Rowan was right.

32:28.279 --> 32:31.240
Something bad is going to happen,
and I need to stop it.

32:31.324 --> 32:32.909
Starting with that monster.

32:34.410 --> 32:35.411
Whoever it is.

32:44.003 --> 32:45.672
<i>I thought nothing scared me,</i>

32:46.172 --> 32:49.634
<i>but that was before I stared</i>
<i>into the eyes of Joseph Crackstone.</i>

32:53.721 --> 32:57.517
<i>I don't believe in heaven or hell.</i>
<i>But I do believe in revenge.</i>

32:58.977 --> 33:01.437
<i>I usually serve it warm</i>
<i>with a side of pain,</i>

33:01.521 --> 33:04.107
<i>but I've never faced</i>
<i>an adversary cast in bronze.</i>

33:20.039 --> 33:21.332
Thank you.

33:21.416 --> 33:25.128
It is my honor
to celebrate our town's history

33:25.211 --> 33:29.549
and Jericho's noble forefather,
Joseph Crackstone.

33:30.341 --> 33:33.845
Now, he believed that
with a happy heart and an open ear,

33:33.928 --> 33:36.597
there was nothing
our town couldn't achieve.

33:36.681 --> 33:42.937
So together as one, our community
and our friends at Nevermore Academy,

33:43.021 --> 33:46.149
we've built a monument
to celebrate his memory.

33:46.232 --> 33:51.696
Now, may the spirit of Joseph Crackstone
be memorialized for eternity.

35:43.182 --> 35:44.767
That was a disaster.

35:44.851 --> 35:46.435
The mayor is furious!

35:46.519 --> 35:50.189
I've lost count of the angry phone calls,
emails, and people in the town,

35:50.273 --> 35:51.440
alumni and parents.

35:51.524 --> 35:53.526
They want answers and so do I.

35:53.609 --> 35:55.111
I would lead the inquisition,

35:55.194 --> 35:56.904
but I left my thumbscrews
and rack at home.

35:58.114 --> 36:01.576
Miss Addams… you're already on thin ice.

36:01.659 --> 36:03.244
Wafer-thin ice.

36:03.327 --> 36:05.663
I swear on my late scorpion's soul,

36:06.247 --> 36:07.456
my hands are clean.

36:18.050 --> 36:20.928
I may not have hard evidence,
but I see you.

36:21.762 --> 36:23.598
You're a trouble magnet.

36:23.681 --> 36:25.892
If trouble means standing up to lies,

36:25.975 --> 36:27.727
decades of discrimination,

36:27.810 --> 36:31.981
centuries of treating outcasts
like second-class citizens or worse…

36:32.064 --> 36:33.816
-What are you talking about?
-Jericho.

36:33.900 --> 36:36.360
Why does this town
even have an Outreach Day?

36:36.444 --> 36:38.696
Don't you know
its real history with outcasts?

36:38.779 --> 36:41.032
The actual story of Joseph Crackstone?

36:43.159 --> 36:44.160
I do.

36:44.660 --> 36:47.872
-To an extent.
-Then why be complicit in its cover up?

36:47.955 --> 36:50.374
Those who forget history
are doomed to repeat it.

36:52.376 --> 36:53.878
That's where you and I differ.

36:54.921 --> 36:56.380
Where you see doom,

36:56.964 --> 36:58.758
I see opportunity.

36:58.841 --> 37:01.093
Maybe this is a chance
to rewrite the wrongs,

37:01.177 --> 37:04.639
to start a new chapter
in the normie-outcast relations.

37:04.722 --> 37:07.600
Nothing has changed
since Crackstone. They still hate us.

37:08.559 --> 37:11.270
Only now they sugarcoat it
with platitudes and smiles.

37:12.313 --> 37:16.108
-If you're unwilling to fight for truth--
-You don't think I want the truth?

37:16.192 --> 37:17.360
Of course I do.

37:17.860 --> 37:19.779
But the world
isn't always black and white.

37:19.862 --> 37:21.280
There are shades of gray.

37:21.364 --> 37:22.406
Maybe for you.

37:23.032 --> 37:25.117
But it's either
they write our story or we do.

37:25.993 --> 37:27.286
You can't have it both ways.

37:29.664 --> 37:30.581
You're exhausting.

37:30.665 --> 37:31.540
I know.

37:37.838 --> 37:39.215
Goodnight, Miss Addams.

37:43.094 --> 37:44.428
But you should know…

37:47.098 --> 37:48.474
I don't tire easily.

38:10.830 --> 38:11.914
Who the hell's there?

38:32.393 --> 38:33.227
Too much?

38:34.603 --> 38:37.440
I feel like
you just napalmed me, Enid.

38:37.523 --> 38:40.151
So glad I have my date with Ajax tonight.

38:40.234 --> 38:42.611
Get my mind off that trainwreck
of an afternoon.

38:42.695 --> 38:46.365
I literally think I have PTSD.
I didn't even get to do my dance routine.

38:46.449 --> 38:47.783
What a tragedy.

38:47.867 --> 38:51.829
What kind of twisted psycho would want
to sabotage such a life-affirming event?

38:53.664 --> 38:54.665
You're going to be late.

38:57.835 --> 38:58.753
Wish me luck.

38:58.836 --> 39:00.755
If he breaks your heart,
I'll nail-gun his.

39:04.717 --> 39:07.386
<i>I don't believe</i>
<i>in mandatory volunteer work,</i>

39:07.470 --> 39:10.639
<i>sugar-coated history, or happy endings,</i>

39:11.682 --> 39:15.561
<i>but most of all…</i>
<i>I don't believe in coincidences.</i>

39:46.133 --> 39:48.260
<i>To paraphrase Agatha Christie,</i>

39:48.969 --> 39:51.722
<i>one coincidence is just a coincidence,</i>

39:52.431 --> 39:53.432
<i>two are a clue…</i>

39:54.558 --> 39:55.810
<i>…and three are proof.</i>

40:05.778 --> 40:06.612
No!

40:25.714 --> 40:29.135
<i>Rowan's drawing of me and Crackstone</i>
<i>happens sometime in the future.</i>

40:30.845 --> 40:34.140
<i>Goody Addams' warnings</i>
<i>about Crackstone were in the past.</i>

40:36.100 --> 40:38.269
<i>And the monster is here in the present.</i>

40:40.604 --> 40:43.232
<i>Three coincidences</i>
<i>that I know are connected.</i>

41:33.407 --> 41:35.493
<i>That monster could be anyone.</i>

41:43.375 --> 41:46.712
<i>The sheriff thinks they only exist</i>
<i>behind the walls of this school.</i>

41:52.301 --> 41:55.221
<i>The truth is,</i>
<i>there are monsters everywhere.</i>

42:02.728 --> 42:07.566
<i>And sometimes the monsters we least</i>
<i>suspect are the most dangerous.</i>

42:12.321 --> 42:14.823
<i>They don't need teeth</i>
<i>and claws to terrify.</i>

42:16.742 --> 42:19.578
<i>They hide in the shadows</i>
<i>until no one is looking.</i>

42:20.746 --> 42:22.206
<i>And then they strike.</i>

42:29.129 --> 42:30.673
<i>But I'm looking now.</i>

42:32.925 --> 42:35.511
<i>And I won't stop until I find the truth.</i>
