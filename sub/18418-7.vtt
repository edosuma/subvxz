00:00.080 --> 00:01.670
- Previously on "Nashville..."

00:01.670 --> 00:03.880
- I had the pleasure of getting
to know your daughter Maddie.

00:03.880 --> 00:06.250
- I don't do the things
you're asking me to do.

00:06.250 --> 00:07.750
I don't move the way
you're asking me to move.

00:07.750 --> 00:10.710
You've shown me what I look like
in my own mind.

00:10.710 --> 00:11.790
How'd you do that?

00:11.790 --> 00:13.460
- I didn't. You did.

00:13.460 --> 00:17.750
- If you will let me, I think
I can help Highway 65 flourish.

00:17.750 --> 00:19.750
- I want us
to write our story.

00:19.750 --> 00:21.330
You don't wanna do it?

00:21.330 --> 00:23.210
- Baby, I don't. It's been one
of the worst years of my life.

00:23.210 --> 00:24.620
I don't much feel like
wading back into it.

00:24.620 --> 00:25.880
- Why don't
you think about it?

00:25.880 --> 00:29.210
- Okay, I'll think about it.

00:34.670 --> 00:37.790
- ♪ One look
into your eyes ♪

00:37.790 --> 00:41.880
♪ And I knew
that I was gone ♪

00:41.880 --> 00:45.540
♪ Stars above looked down ♪

00:45.540 --> 00:48.920
♪ And we counted every one ♪

00:51.830 --> 00:53.170
- What's that?

00:53.170 --> 00:54.620
- It's just something
I'm trying.

00:54.620 --> 00:57.540
I don't know if it's working
or not, though.

00:57.540 --> 00:59.170
It's about our first kiss.

00:59.170 --> 01:01.080
- I love that.
- Yeah?

01:01.080 --> 01:03.040
Coming offstage
at the Exit Inn?

01:03.040 --> 01:04.120
- Honey, our first kiss

01:04.120 --> 01:05.750
was not coming offstage
at the Exit Inn.

01:05.750 --> 01:08.580
Our first kiss
was in your car

01:08.580 --> 01:11.460
when you drove me home
from Stewart Osborne's party.

01:11.460 --> 01:13.460
- Baby, our first kiss
was at the Exit Inn.

01:13.460 --> 01:14.580
I know it was.

01:14.580 --> 01:15.620
- No. We did not kiss
that night.

01:15.620 --> 01:17.170
You were with
Samantha Beasley.

01:17.170 --> 01:19.420
Samantha Beeswax, remember?

01:19.420 --> 01:21.250
- Yeah, you might be right.

01:21.250 --> 01:23.750
- You wish you'd kissed me
that night at the Exit Inn.

01:23.750 --> 01:24.920
These are the facts, honey.

01:24.920 --> 01:26.920
The rest
is just cheap whiskey.

01:26.920 --> 01:28.210
(doorbell rings)

01:28.210 --> 01:29.380
- That part's true.

01:29.380 --> 01:31.620
- Yes, that part's true.
We know that.

01:31.620 --> 01:33.620
- (chuckles)
- Yes?

01:33.620 --> 01:35.120
- I have
a Gene Buckholder here.

01:35.120 --> 01:37.290
- What's a Gene Buckholder?

01:37.290 --> 01:38.670
- All right. Yeah.

01:38.670 --> 01:40.620
You can send him up.
Thank you.

01:40.620 --> 01:43.290
You remember when I told you
that Zach

01:43.290 --> 01:48.000
wanted to hire this guy
to video us writing this record?

01:48.000 --> 01:50.790
- No.

01:50.790 --> 01:54.540
- Hello, Gene.
So nice to see you again.

01:54.540 --> 01:56.960
- Hi, Ms. Jaymes.
Hope this isn't a bad time.

01:56.960 --> 01:58.580
- Well, I'd like to think

01:58.580 --> 02:01.380
I'd get a little more
advance notice, but...

02:01.380 --> 02:02.710
- Hi. Gene Buckholder.

02:02.710 --> 02:04.210
- Deacon Claybourne.

02:04.210 --> 02:06.040
- I met Gene
last week at the office

02:06.040 --> 02:07.960
and he's done
some amazing work

02:07.960 --> 02:10.670
and he seems like
a nice fellow, so...

02:10.670 --> 02:12.080
- So you're gonna film us
while we're writing?

02:12.080 --> 02:13.460
- I promise
I won't get in the way.

02:13.460 --> 02:14.500
In fact, today I thought

02:14.500 --> 02:16.040
I'd just get
some establishing shots.

02:16.040 --> 02:18.580
- Yeah, and I think we're gonna
set some limitations, too.

02:18.580 --> 02:20.710
We won't shoot anything
in the bedroom,

02:20.710 --> 02:21.790
and I think, you know,

02:21.790 --> 02:23.120
the TV room
should be off-limits.

02:23.120 --> 02:25.460
And dinner and nothing
with the girls, of course.

02:25.460 --> 02:27.290
- So when will I film you?

02:27.290 --> 02:29.580
- Um...I don't know.

02:29.580 --> 02:30.960
We can go to see
the music room right now.

02:30.960 --> 02:32.000
Shall we show him
the music room?

02:32.000 --> 02:34.880
Let's show him
the music room. Okay.

02:34.880 --> 02:37.040
This way.

02:38.920 --> 02:40.040
- Do you ever wish
you'd done something

02:40.040 --> 02:43.000
completely different
with your life?

02:43.000 --> 02:45.880
- You mean like become
an astrophysicist?

02:45.880 --> 02:49.330
- No. What would you have done
if you couldn't do music?

02:49.330 --> 02:50.620
- Die. (chuckles)

02:50.620 --> 02:53.250
- I envy you.
- Why?

02:53.250 --> 02:54.170
- Because you just know.

02:54.170 --> 02:56.540
People like you
are real lucky.

02:56.540 --> 02:58.380
- Music's the only thing
that makes me happy.

02:58.380 --> 03:00.750
- Yeah, but did you ever think
all this stuff was gonna happen?

03:00.750 --> 03:02.210
Because I sure didn't.

03:02.210 --> 03:04.250
- You know, I'm just gonna
check the video once more.

03:04.250 --> 03:05.460
- Sure. Yeah.

03:05.460 --> 03:06.620
- Whoa.
- What?

03:06.620 --> 03:08.880
- We got a million views!

03:08.880 --> 03:10.210
Check it out.

03:10.210 --> 03:12.380
Oh, my God. 3,000 more?

03:12.380 --> 03:15.170
(laughs)
(cell phones rings)

03:15.170 --> 03:16.290
- Sorry.

03:16.290 --> 03:18.000
(ring)

03:18.000 --> 03:19.080
- Hello?
- Hello?

03:19.080 --> 03:20.790
- No.
- Oh, hi.

03:20.790 --> 03:21.960
- Yeah, it's wild, right?

03:21.960 --> 03:23.620
- Yeah, um...
- That sounds good.

03:23.620 --> 03:25.290
- It's NBC Nashville.

03:25.290 --> 03:28.330
- No. After Buzz Nashville
wants to put us on the cover.

03:28.330 --> 03:31.120
- Okay. Yeah, we could--

03:31.120 --> 03:32.120
- Absolutely.

03:32.120 --> 03:33.460
- Hang on. Tomorrow?

03:33.460 --> 03:35.000
Can we do it tomorrow?
- Yeah.

03:35.000 --> 03:36.790
- Yeah, we'll be there.
Thank you.

03:36.790 --> 03:38.380
- Fantastic. All right.

03:38.380 --> 03:41.290
- Okay, bye.
- All right. Bye.

03:41.290 --> 03:42.580
Wow.

03:42.580 --> 03:44.620
- Yep. Wow.

03:47.000 --> 03:49.210
- Oh, this memorabilia
is amazing.

03:49.210 --> 03:51.080
- Yeah.

03:51.080 --> 03:53.040
- That's so cool.

03:53.040 --> 03:58.120
- Uh-huh. So this
is the music room.

03:58.120 --> 04:00.880
And I think that's
probably good for today.

04:00.880 --> 04:03.290
- Zach said
that I should hang out

04:03.290 --> 04:05.670
and like capture real life,
you know, as it happens.

04:05.670 --> 04:07.170
- Maybe you can get some
real life in the kitchen.

04:07.170 --> 04:08.710
- Yeah. I think we're
gonna get back to work.

04:08.710 --> 04:11.460
So you could shoot some B-roll
in the kitchen?

04:11.460 --> 04:14.250
That'd be good. We got lots
of good appliances.

04:14.250 --> 04:17.880
Thanks, Gene. Thank you.

04:17.880 --> 04:19.540
Are you kidding me?

04:19.540 --> 04:21.210
- Well, I thought it
very conducive

04:21.210 --> 04:22.790
to have a complete stranger
roaming around our home

04:22.790 --> 04:24.080
filming everything we do.

04:24.080 --> 04:26.620
Puts me in the mood
to write a beautiful song.

04:26.620 --> 04:28.880
- Mm-hmm.
About Samantha Beasley.

04:28.880 --> 04:31.710
- Oh, man, I'm not gonna
live that down ever.

04:31.710 --> 04:32.750
- No, you're not.

04:32.750 --> 04:34.040
- That girl was history

04:34.040 --> 04:36.000
the minute
I laid eyes on you.

04:36.000 --> 04:37.500
- That is so not--
you strung her along

04:37.500 --> 04:39.710
until she told you
you'd better fish or cut bait.

04:39.710 --> 04:41.960
- Perfect memory
is overrated, all right?

04:41.960 --> 04:44.670
I was a little bit
of a mess back then.

04:44.670 --> 04:46.710
- Mm-hmm. This is true.

04:46.710 --> 04:49.790
It was a good kiss
in the car, though.

04:49.790 --> 04:51.580
- Well, you and that kiss

04:51.580 --> 04:53.540
was the first good thing
ever happened to me.

04:53.540 --> 04:56.920
- It wasn't all fairy tale
after that, that's for sure.

04:56.920 --> 04:59.380
- I know, but...

04:59.380 --> 05:02.580
- Gene!

05:02.580 --> 05:04.170
- I swear
I couldn't hear anything.

05:04.170 --> 05:05.380
It just was a really good
moment between you two--

05:05.380 --> 05:06.580
- Why don't I show you
to the kitchen.

05:06.580 --> 05:09.500
It is so easy to get lost
in this house.

05:09.500 --> 05:11.460
Zach,
this is not gonna work.

05:11.460 --> 05:13.540
This record
is too important to us,

05:13.540 --> 05:16.670
and we can't write it
if we've got some guy

05:16.670 --> 05:18.580
breathing down our necks
all the time.

05:18.580 --> 05:20.500
It's impossible.
- Look, Rayna, I hear you,

05:20.500 --> 05:22.380
but this is the world
we live in.

05:22.380 --> 05:23.620
We can't just put
out an album

05:23.620 --> 05:25.460
and expect it
to sell itself, okay?

05:25.460 --> 05:27.620
We have to keep finding
new ways of promoting you.

05:27.620 --> 05:29.670
- Well, we are gonna
have to set some limits.

05:29.670 --> 05:32.500
- Rayna, your fans,
they're gonna eat this up.

05:32.500 --> 05:34.210
Are you kidding me?
A behind-the-scenes video

05:34.210 --> 05:35.670
of you two
creating an album?

05:35.670 --> 05:36.580
It's too good.

05:36.580 --> 05:37.960
And you will have
final approval

05:37.960 --> 05:40.710
on every bit of it,
I promise.

05:40.710 --> 05:45.580
- Well, just so you know,
I take promises seriously.

05:45.580 --> 05:48.500
- ♪ I went down
to the graveyard ♪

05:48.500 --> 05:52.000
♪ Fell down on my knees ♪

05:52.000 --> 05:56.210
♪ My tender knees ♪

05:56.210 --> 05:58.380
- This is so awesome.

05:58.380 --> 06:00.580
- Yeah. No, he's great.

06:03.880 --> 06:06.380
Sorry about all the mess.

06:06.380 --> 06:09.040
- No. It's fine.
I love it here.

06:09.040 --> 06:11.120
It's like
all about the music.

06:11.120 --> 06:12.380
It's you.

06:12.380 --> 06:15.170
- Yeah, I know.
The crazy part of me maybe.

06:15.170 --> 06:16.710
- The creative part.

06:16.710 --> 06:20.380
- Well, I should be getting
you home. It's late.

06:20.380 --> 06:24.710
- No. My parents go to sleep
at like 9:30 these days.

06:24.710 --> 06:27.380
- God, you still live
with your parents?

06:27.380 --> 06:28.830
- Don't hold that
against me.

06:28.830 --> 06:30.670
- Whatever you say.

06:35.880 --> 06:39.540
- Or I could stay
if you want.

06:43.830 --> 06:47.080
- It's fine if you want
to be a little rebel

06:47.080 --> 06:48.540
and piss your parents off.

06:48.540 --> 06:50.380
- You really think
that's what this is about?

06:50.380 --> 06:52.710
- Look,
I'm not good at this.

06:52.710 --> 06:56.000
I mean, it gets serious,
that's it. I'm gone.

06:56.000 --> 06:57.210
It's what I do.

06:57.210 --> 07:00.170
- Then why
are you here with me?

07:00.170 --> 07:02.710
- I don't want
to fall for you.

07:09.880 --> 07:11.710
- You already have.

07:19.830 --> 07:21.750
- Deacon?
- Hmm?

07:21.750 --> 07:24.710
- You awake?
- No.

07:24.710 --> 07:26.710
- I can't stop thinking
about Maddie and Clay.

07:26.710 --> 07:30.330
- Oh, honey, maybe
we'll get lucky, you know,

07:30.330 --> 07:32.210
and it'll just
burn itself out.

07:32.210 --> 07:33.830
- Do you really
believe that?

07:33.830 --> 07:34.920
- No.

07:34.920 --> 07:36.750
- I mean, he's so much older
than she is. It's illegal.

07:36.750 --> 07:42.460
- Honey, I think
you just need to go sleep.

07:42.460 --> 07:43.170
Go to sleep.

07:43.170 --> 07:44.830
- You can't just order
a person to go to sleep.

07:44.830 --> 07:46.580
That's not how it works.

07:46.580 --> 07:49.250
I think
I came up with an idea.

07:49.250 --> 07:51.080
- For what, honey?

07:51.080 --> 07:52.500
- What do you mean,
for what?

07:52.500 --> 07:54.210
For the first song
on our record.

07:54.210 --> 07:55.710
- Is it 3 A.M.?

07:55.710 --> 07:57.040
- Once we decided
we were gonna start,

07:57.040 --> 07:58.500
I couldn't really
stop thinking.

07:58.500 --> 07:59.830
- I'm sure it's a wonderful
idea, sweetheart.

07:59.830 --> 08:01.380
- Do you want to hear it?

08:01.380 --> 08:03.210
I'm afraid if I don't tell,
I'm gonna forget it.

08:03.210 --> 08:04.710
- I want to hear it, honey.

08:04.710 --> 08:06.540
I'm just thinking that maybe
we should just go ahead

08:06.540 --> 08:09.960
and, you know,
continue in the morning?

08:09.960 --> 08:12.210
- It used to be so easy
for us to write.

08:12.210 --> 08:15.500
I mean, we would literally
write a song in our sleep.

08:53.210 --> 08:54.830
- I'm really excited
to be back in Nashville,

08:54.830 --> 08:56.000
because I've told Hoda this.

08:56.000 --> 08:58.080
I pretty much started
my career here

08:58.080 --> 09:00.750
doing a TV show called
"Hee Haw Honeys."

09:00.750 --> 09:03.420
- (laughs)
- I know. In 1977.

09:03.420 --> 09:06.080
If they had TV in 1977.

09:06.080 --> 09:09.170
- Hi, everybody. Today
we are so incredibly thrilled

09:09.170 --> 09:11.080
to welcome to our couch
the Exes.

09:11.080 --> 09:12.380
They are here.

09:12.380 --> 09:14.880
You guys have dropped
a terrific new music video.

09:14.880 --> 09:17.330
It's called "All of Me."
- "All of Me."

09:17.330 --> 09:18.540
- And can I tell you
something?

09:18.540 --> 09:20.040
The internet is exploding.
- It sure is.

09:20.040 --> 09:21.460
- So how excited
are you guys?

09:21.460 --> 09:23.380
- We're so excited.
We're kind of blown away.

09:23.380 --> 09:26.380
- You must be. It's over
a million views already.

09:26.380 --> 09:27.920
But I gotta say,
it's really

09:27.920 --> 09:29.500
a bit of a departure
for the two of you

09:29.500 --> 09:31.580
to do a video like this,
isn't it?

09:31.580 --> 09:32.620
- It is. You know, we--

09:32.620 --> 09:34.880
- It was a departure
for me, too,

09:34.880 --> 09:36.330
and I think Scarlett
was a real revelation.

09:36.330 --> 09:38.080
She took it
to the next level.

09:38.080 --> 09:40.080
- Yeah, Scarlett,
what was that like for you,

09:40.080 --> 09:42.920
I mean, revealing
so much of yourself?

09:42.920 --> 09:45.290
- Well, I had to try
and understand

09:45.290 --> 09:46.620
the person I was playing

09:46.620 --> 09:49.710
and find a part of me
that could relate to her.

09:49.710 --> 09:50.830
- Don't let her fool you.

09:50.830 --> 09:52.830
I tortured her, basically.
- He did.

09:52.830 --> 09:54.750
- Scarlett, when you
were doing this video,

09:54.750 --> 09:57.580
did you feel like
something inside you changed?

09:57.580 --> 09:58.790
- You know what?
I guess so.

09:58.790 --> 10:00.420
I'm still trying
to figure that out.

10:00.420 --> 10:03.040
- Well, all right. Let's all
take a look, shall we?

10:03.040 --> 10:04.040
Ladies and gentlemen,
here it is.

10:04.040 --> 10:06.330
"All of Me."
- "All of Me."

10:09.920 --> 10:14.750
- ♪ Your touch, your touch
is everything now.

10:14.750 --> 10:17.880
- I can't wait to get
all this makeup off.

10:17.880 --> 10:19.540
- What the hell was that?

10:19.540 --> 10:20.880
- What was what?

10:20.880 --> 10:23.540
- You two sure got on
like a house on fire

10:23.540 --> 10:26.620
after your little hatefest.

10:26.620 --> 10:27.830
- That was fun.

10:27.830 --> 10:29.420
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

10:29.420 --> 10:30.670
- Listen, I've got to bolt,
but, hey, let's celebrate.

10:30.670 --> 10:32.120
Dinner tonight?
The three of us?

10:32.120 --> 10:33.880
- I can't. Sorry.
- Can't.

10:33.880 --> 10:35.580
I promised Avery
I'd finish a song with him.

10:35.580 --> 10:38.250
But I'm sure Scarlett can.

10:40.000 --> 10:43.580
- Hey, you guys figure it out.
I'll call you.

10:43.580 --> 10:46.710
- You should go.
Be rude not to.

10:46.710 --> 10:48.120
- What if I don't want to?

10:48.120 --> 10:49.210
- Then don't.

10:49.210 --> 10:50.830
- Do you want me to go?

10:50.830 --> 10:53.920
- I don't care.
You can do whatever you want.

10:55.750 --> 10:58.540
- All right.
So we're writing about love

10:58.540 --> 11:00.750
and we're writing
about marriage.

11:00.750 --> 11:04.420
- They say love is a story

11:04.420 --> 11:07.460
and marriage
is a conversation.

11:07.460 --> 11:09.420
- (chuckles)

11:09.420 --> 11:12.080
- How you doing over there,
Gene?

11:12.080 --> 11:13.170
- I'm okay.

11:13.170 --> 11:15.420
- You know you can
head on out any time.

11:15.420 --> 11:16.750
- Nope.

11:16.750 --> 11:18.880
- Well, this is something.

11:18.880 --> 11:22.420
This comes out of...
I been thinking

11:22.420 --> 11:24.750
about all that time
we spent apart,

11:24.750 --> 11:32.120
and somehow it always felt
like you were there with me.

11:32.120 --> 11:36.120
Like, I mean, I just have
a little here.

11:36.120 --> 11:40.330
♪ Around the corner
just a glimpse ♪

11:40.330 --> 11:46.460
♪ Of the light
shining in your hair ♪

11:46.460 --> 11:50.460
♪ The smell
of your perfume ♪

11:50.460 --> 11:54.170
♪ Just like you were there ♪

11:54.170 --> 11:56.830
- It's real pretty.

11:57.750 --> 11:59.620
So you felt like

11:59.620 --> 12:04.790
I was there with you
even when I wasn't.

12:04.790 --> 12:06.580
- Yeah, kind of.

12:15.170 --> 12:19.670
- I'm late.
- No, no. I'm early. Sit.

12:19.670 --> 12:20.920
- Thank you.

12:22.620 --> 12:24.830
- It's too bad Gunnar
couldn't join us.

12:28.040 --> 12:31.040
I thought we could celebrate the
fact that we're still speaking.

12:32.080 --> 12:35.920
But first,
I owe you an apology.

12:35.920 --> 12:37.920
I was on a mission.
I admit it.

12:37.920 --> 12:39.920
And I'm sure it felt like

12:39.920 --> 12:42.040
I pushed you
way too hard sometimes.

12:42.040 --> 12:44.000
- Go on.

12:44.000 --> 12:45.960
- Okay, I was a jerk.
How's that?

12:47.580 --> 12:48.790
Give me a break here.

12:48.790 --> 12:51.080
You can pick up your glass
any time now.

12:53.420 --> 12:55.250
Do you want me to grovel?

12:55.250 --> 12:56.830
- It would be a start.

12:56.830 --> 12:58.620
- Jeez, you are tough.

12:58.620 --> 13:00.460
- Oh, and you
were just doing your job.

13:00.460 --> 13:04.210
- We struck gold, Scarlett.

13:04.210 --> 13:05.960
- Maybe.

13:15.460 --> 13:17.420
- What do you got there?

13:17.420 --> 13:18.880
- Well,
I'm reading something

13:18.880 --> 13:20.920
that I wrote
in the middle of the night.

13:20.920 --> 13:22.620
And now of course
I can't read my handwriting.

13:22.620 --> 13:24.250
- Tell me more
about this idea.

13:24.250 --> 13:27.750
- Well, I was thinking
about being homesick

13:27.750 --> 13:29.920
for a place
you've never been before.

13:29.920 --> 13:31.170
- I like that.
- You do?

13:31.170 --> 13:32.580
- Yeah. What do you got?

13:32.580 --> 13:33.830
- All right. So this goes...

13:33.830 --> 13:36.920
♪ I know
what it looks like ♪

13:36.920 --> 13:39.670
♪ I know how it feels ♪

13:39.670 --> 13:42.460
♪ I was there once ♪

13:42.460 --> 13:43.920
It's like
you know the place,

13:43.920 --> 13:45.290
but you can't
get back there.

13:45.290 --> 13:48.710
- No, it's kind of like
we were saying earlier

13:48.710 --> 13:51.000
that thing about
when somebody's not there,

13:51.000 --> 13:52.670
but you feel
like they're there.

13:52.670 --> 13:54.250
And you're saying like

13:54.250 --> 13:56.000
maybe the two of them
could go together.

13:56.000 --> 13:57.380
- I know, but that
was your experience.

13:57.380 --> 13:59.420
But that was just not...

13:59.420 --> 14:02.250
I mean, you know, for me,
it was just a catastrophe.

14:02.250 --> 14:04.500
- That's fair enough.

14:04.500 --> 14:07.960
So what
do you got more on this?

14:07.960 --> 14:10.750
- I mean, here I said,
why do people

14:10.750 --> 14:14.290
always look for happiness
right where they lost it?

14:14.290 --> 14:16.210
- Well, is that a good thing
or is it a bad thing?

14:16.210 --> 14:17.380
- It's just a thing,

14:17.380 --> 14:19.880
'cause I spent
so many years doing that.

14:19.880 --> 14:22.330
- Deacon! My printer
ran out of ink,

14:22.330 --> 14:24.460
and I need
to print my report.

14:24.460 --> 14:25.750
- I'm coming, sweetie.

14:25.750 --> 14:27.580
I'll be right back.

14:31.250 --> 14:33.750
- If I could just...
If I could just...

14:33.750 --> 14:36.120
Just, please, just the kiss.
It would be so great.

14:36.120 --> 14:38.210
- No, we're not just gonna
kiss for the camera.

14:38.210 --> 14:39.880
- Come on.
- No, no.

14:41.750 --> 14:44.290
Bye, Gene. Bye.

14:46.420 --> 14:48.920
- It wasn't even
a town really.

14:48.920 --> 14:51.920
It was a farm
at the end of a dirt road

14:51.920 --> 14:53.500
with a rural
delivery address.

14:53.500 --> 14:56.580
But it was my whole world.

14:56.580 --> 14:58.380
Well, until I took
my first airplane ride.

14:58.380 --> 15:00.080
And I looked down

15:00.080 --> 15:02.330
and I saw
Natchez, Mississippi,

15:02.330 --> 15:04.080
my whole life really,

15:04.080 --> 15:07.080
and it fit between
these two fingers.

15:07.080 --> 15:08.670
( both laugh )

15:08.670 --> 15:11.210
- No wonder doing
the video scared you.

15:11.210 --> 15:14.250
- You scared me.

15:14.250 --> 15:16.880
- Maybe you scared yourself.

15:16.880 --> 15:18.920
I just know
I saw something in you,

15:18.920 --> 15:23.420
something raw and real.

15:23.420 --> 15:29.670
- Well, I hope it was a good
thing, whatever you saw.

15:29.670 --> 15:31.620
- Oh, it was.

15:42.790 --> 15:45.920
( indistinct arguing )

15:53.250 --> 15:55.210
- Well, I'm a hero.

15:55.210 --> 15:59.040
Needed an ink cartridge
and I know where they are.

15:59.040 --> 16:00.580
You get this thing
figured out yet?

16:00.580 --> 16:02.080
- Oh, it's going nowhere.

16:02.080 --> 16:04.580
- Well,
let's turn it around.

16:04.580 --> 16:05.710
- I think I need
to take a break.

16:05.710 --> 16:07.170
- Oh, no. Come on, baby.

16:07.170 --> 16:08.380
You're just talking to me
about you not--

16:08.380 --> 16:09.790
- No, I need to stop.

16:09.790 --> 16:11.580
- Come on, sweetheart.
I'm trying to work this out.

16:11.580 --> 16:13.210
- Well, we can't.

16:14.540 --> 16:17.000
- All right, damn it!

16:17.000 --> 16:18.040
- What?

16:19.920 --> 16:21.330
- Let's get the hell
out of here.

16:21.330 --> 16:24.080
- Where do you wanna go?

16:24.080 --> 16:25.330
- You'll see.

16:28.670 --> 16:32.040
Bye, girls.
We're going out for a while.

16:33.750 --> 16:35.960
- Honey, where are we going?

16:35.960 --> 16:38.790
- Yeah, I don't know.
( both laugh )

16:38.790 --> 16:42.250
Remember we used to just waltz
out the door without a plan?

16:42.250 --> 16:45.040
- Oh, honey, we haven't waltzed
anywhere in 15 years.

16:45.040 --> 16:46.830
( both laugh )

16:46.830 --> 16:49.080
- Are you kidding me?
- What?

16:49.080 --> 16:50.620
- He's following us.

16:52.500 --> 16:55.380
- Gene, you are so fired!

16:55.380 --> 16:56.710
- Here we go, baby.

16:56.710 --> 16:58.460
Hang on!

16:58.460 --> 17:00.920
- Babe, what are you doing?

17:07.540 --> 17:10.830
I think you lost him.
- I think I did.

17:10.830 --> 17:15.040
Now I'm gonna take you
on a date...alone.

17:15.040 --> 17:18.040
- Focus, focus, focus.

17:18.040 --> 17:19.750
Don't miss it.

17:20.620 --> 17:22.920
- Oh!
- Nice.

17:25.210 --> 17:27.170
- Your turn, baby.
You got this.

17:27.170 --> 17:29.290
- All right.
- Yep.

17:29.290 --> 17:32.420
Put a little English on it.

17:32.420 --> 17:33.880
- Oh, no!
- There you go!

17:33.880 --> 17:37.000
This is gonna be good!
- Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

17:37.000 --> 17:40.420
- That's not bad.
You don't like that one?

17:40.420 --> 17:42.380
- I got a couple
I gotta deal with.

17:42.380 --> 17:44.500
- Would you like me to help?
I'm gonna help you on this one.

17:44.500 --> 17:45.790
- No.
- Yeah, I am.

17:45.790 --> 17:47.460
- I don't need your help.
I can get this.

17:47.460 --> 17:48.670
Blast those pins
all by myself.

17:48.670 --> 17:50.040
- It is all about
the angle, okay?

17:50.040 --> 17:51.170
- Oh, is that right?

17:51.170 --> 17:52.420
I have a feeling

17:52.420 --> 17:53.540
you're just trying
to make me nervous.

17:53.540 --> 17:54.710
- That's possible.

17:54.710 --> 17:56.210
You put it right
in that pocket, okay?

17:56.210 --> 17:58.040
- What are you doing?

17:58.040 --> 18:00.040
You cannot tickle me!

18:00.040 --> 18:01.880
( both laugh )

18:01.880 --> 18:03.420
You made me lose.

18:03.420 --> 18:06.460
- Well,
it's better than mine.

18:06.460 --> 18:07.960
- Okay, Daph,
tell me about this boy.

18:07.960 --> 18:10.330
- Well, his name is Flynn.
- Okay.

18:10.330 --> 18:12.540
- He has this cute
crooked smile,

18:12.540 --> 18:15.040
but he doesn't
really say much.

18:15.040 --> 18:16.380
- You think he likes you?

18:16.380 --> 18:18.170
- We're in
the very beginning stages

18:18.170 --> 18:20.040
of our relationship, so...

18:20.040 --> 18:24.540
- Well, the thing about boys
is they are completely clueless.

18:24.540 --> 18:26.040
- What do you mean?

18:26.040 --> 18:29.040
- It's like half the time
they aren't even awake.

18:29.040 --> 18:32.540
This cake is gonna be in there
for like an hour.

18:32.540 --> 18:33.880
( doorbell rings )

18:33.880 --> 18:35.380
- Okay.

18:35.380 --> 18:37.670
- I have a Clay Carter here.

18:37.670 --> 18:40.080
Says he's here to see Maddie?
- Clay?

18:40.080 --> 18:41.880
- Yeah, he's just coming
to say hey.

18:41.880 --> 18:43.670
- He can come in.

18:43.670 --> 18:45.920
- Okay. Daphne,
you cannot hang around us

18:45.920 --> 18:47.960
the entire night, though.
Seriously.

18:51.290 --> 18:53.210
- Hey, I'm Clay.

18:53.210 --> 18:54.710
- I'm Daphne.
Nice to meet you.

18:54.710 --> 18:57.040
- Thanks for letting me
come over.

18:57.040 --> 18:59.750
- Of course.

18:59.750 --> 19:03.540
Okay, Daphne, do not forget
to take this cake out.

19:03.540 --> 19:05.580
We're just gonna be hanging out
upstairs, okay?

19:05.580 --> 19:08.380
- Okay.
Can we play cards later?

19:08.380 --> 19:11.080
- I would love that.
What's your game?

19:11.080 --> 19:12.210
- Gin.

19:12.210 --> 19:15.040
- Oh, I'm gonna
decimate you.

19:20.880 --> 19:25.040
- You just wanted to quit
because I was winning.

19:28.750 --> 19:31.380
It's nice just being us
for a change.

19:31.380 --> 19:32.710
- Why don't we get a room?

19:32.710 --> 19:34.830
- Are you serious?
- I'm dead serious.

19:34.830 --> 19:36.830
I want to spend time
alone with you.

19:36.830 --> 19:38.380
- So tempting.

19:38.380 --> 19:40.000
( cell phone rings )

19:40.000 --> 19:41.120
Hold on.

19:42.830 --> 19:45.250
It's Security.
Hold on.

19:45.250 --> 19:46.580
Hello?

19:46.580 --> 19:48.040
- Ms. Jaymes?
- Yes?

19:48.040 --> 19:50.380
- There's a fire alarm
going off in your residence

19:50.380 --> 19:51.670
in the kitchen area.
- Oh, my God.

19:51.670 --> 19:54.120
- We called the house,
but no one responded.

19:54.120 --> 19:55.250
- Okay.

19:55.250 --> 19:56.750
- Can you give us
your pass code?

19:56.750 --> 19:58.040
- What's our pass code?

19:58.040 --> 19:59.290
- I don't know.

19:59.290 --> 20:00.830
- I can't think.

20:00.830 --> 20:02.670
I don't think we know
our pass code.

20:02.670 --> 20:03.960
- That's all right.
- You know what?

20:03.960 --> 20:05.960
We're just gonna go home
right now, okay?

20:05.960 --> 20:07.830
Thank you.
- All right, ma'am.

20:07.830 --> 20:09.880
- Why didn't Maddie call?
- Look, let's just go.

20:17.540 --> 20:19.040
- Is everything okay?

20:19.040 --> 20:21.500
- Don't worry. Everything
is under control, ma'am.

20:21.500 --> 20:22.880
No fire, just smoke.

20:22.880 --> 20:25.040
- Okay. Thank you so much.
- Thank you very much.

20:25.040 --> 20:27.380
- You got quite a little cook
there at home.

20:31.380 --> 20:32.960
- ( coughs )

20:39.170 --> 20:41.120
- Hi.

20:41.120 --> 20:42.790
- Hi.
- Hi.

20:42.790 --> 20:44.540
- Hi.

20:44.540 --> 20:45.790
- So you were
baking something?

20:45.790 --> 20:48.380
- Yep, and Clay
was just heading out.

20:48.380 --> 20:50.290
- Nice to see you again.

20:50.290 --> 20:51.540
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

20:51.540 --> 20:53.380
- I hope you guys
had fun tonight.

20:53.380 --> 20:57.120
- We did...until
our fire alarm went off.

21:00.250 --> 21:02.460
- Where's your sister?
- Upstairs.

21:02.460 --> 21:04.170
- I want to talk to you
for a second.

21:04.170 --> 21:05.420
- Come on. Everyone's fine.

21:05.420 --> 21:06.880
The cake burned.
Nobody died.

21:06.880 --> 21:08.880
- Where exactly were you
when the cake burned?

21:08.880 --> 21:10.830
- So this is
a little awkward,

21:10.830 --> 21:13.920
but I am actually a huge fan
of yours, Mr. Claybourne.

21:13.920 --> 21:15.710
- Really?
- Don't worry, Mom.

21:15.710 --> 21:17.420
It's not like anyone has
any privacy in this house ever.

21:17.420 --> 21:18.790
- The point is,
your sister is here.

21:18.790 --> 21:20.210
It's confusing to her.

21:20.210 --> 21:23.330
- Yeah. I saw this show
you did outside of Memphis.

21:23.330 --> 21:26.250
Amazing.
Really tight band, too.

21:26.250 --> 21:27.670
That drummer, Donny...

21:27.670 --> 21:30.670
- McAllister, yeah.

21:30.670 --> 21:32.540
How long ago was that?

21:32.540 --> 21:36.120
- Oh, this has got to be
about eight years ago.

21:36.120 --> 21:37.540
- Huh.

21:37.540 --> 21:40.460
- You don't know
the first thing about Clay

21:40.460 --> 21:41.710
or what he's really like.

21:41.710 --> 21:42.920
- We'll talk
about this later.

21:42.920 --> 21:43.880
- No, we won't.

21:43.880 --> 21:45.250
- Oh, yes, we will,
young lady.

21:45.250 --> 21:46.790
My house, my rules.

21:46.790 --> 21:47.880
- My life.

21:47.880 --> 21:50.790
- Uh, bye, Mrs. Jaymes.
Bye, Maddie.

21:50.790 --> 21:53.540
- Bye, Clay.
Lovely to see you.

22:04.080 --> 22:06.620
- Hey!
What a great surprise!

22:06.620 --> 22:07.880
- Ah, I can come back later
if you're busy.

22:07.880 --> 22:09.000
- No, no. Come sit.

22:09.000 --> 22:10.960
I was gonna call you
today anyway.

22:10.960 --> 22:13.380
Two million hits?
- Yeah.

22:13.380 --> 22:15.380
- That's incredible.
- It's crazy.

22:15.380 --> 22:17.210
- Well, it is.
I am so proud of you.

22:17.210 --> 22:18.830
I know it was not
as easy as it looked.

22:18.830 --> 22:21.420
- ( laughs )
Not even close, no.

22:21.420 --> 22:23.080
- We'll have to get y'all
on a tour pronto.

22:23.080 --> 22:26.250
- Yeah. It's exciting.
But how are you?

22:26.250 --> 22:27.920
How's writing with Deacon?
I haven't seen you.

22:27.920 --> 22:30.000
- Oh, it's interesting.

22:30.000 --> 22:32.960
Just trying to get on
the same page a little bit.

22:32.960 --> 22:34.750
- Yeah,
I can relate to that.

22:34.750 --> 22:36.380
- How are you and Gunnar?

22:36.380 --> 22:40.380
- Um...hanging on,
sort of, barelyish.

22:40.380 --> 22:43.420
- Oh, I'm sorry. I thought y'all
had gotten to a good place.

22:43.420 --> 22:46.040
- So did I.
Then this director--

22:46.040 --> 22:48.380
- Damien?
- Yeah.

22:48.380 --> 22:50.000
I was so busy
hating on him,

22:50.000 --> 22:53.420
I didn't realize I was learning
things from him about myself.

22:53.420 --> 22:56.750
And Gunnar's intensity
right now

22:56.750 --> 22:58.330
is a little difficult
to deal with.

22:58.330 --> 23:00.920
- Mm-hmm. Nothing like being in
a relationship with an artist.

23:00.920 --> 23:03.420
Two artists together?
Lord help you.

23:03.420 --> 23:06.040
- Yeah, all we seem to do
is hurt each other,

23:06.040 --> 23:07.420
and I'm starting to wonder

23:07.420 --> 23:08.880
is that just the way
it's supposed to be or--

23:08.880 --> 23:10.580
- Well, I don't know.

23:10.580 --> 23:13.420
I think no relationship
is ever one thing.

23:13.420 --> 23:15.120
You start out
with this great connection,

23:15.120 --> 23:19.080
and then next thing
you know, it's gone.

23:19.080 --> 23:21.920
- Yeah. You like ever
get it right again?

23:21.920 --> 23:23.460
- Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

23:23.460 --> 23:25.170
If you're lucky,
lots of times.

23:25.170 --> 23:29.330
I remember the day that
Deacon and I were together.

23:29.330 --> 23:30.710
We were at his lake house
in the woods.

23:30.710 --> 23:32.040
It was a beautiful
misty day,

23:32.040 --> 23:34.000
and we just had
this huge fight.

23:34.000 --> 23:35.580
I don't remember
what it was about.

23:35.580 --> 23:39.750
And I got so mad I just
decided I'm walking away.

23:39.750 --> 23:42.290
I'm done.
I'm out of here.

23:42.290 --> 23:44.500
But as I walked away,
I remember thinking to myself,

23:44.500 --> 23:49.380
but if he comes after me
right now and he gets me,

23:49.380 --> 23:51.920
then I'll be with him
forever.

23:51.920 --> 23:54.040
- And he did?

23:54.040 --> 23:58.000
- Well, it took him about
20 years, but eventually.

23:58.000 --> 24:00.580
Like I said, I'm not
an expert in this matter.

24:00.580 --> 24:02.830
- I guess nobody
got it easy.

24:02.830 --> 24:05.500
- That's for sure.

24:11.500 --> 24:13.580
- We meet again.

24:13.580 --> 24:14.880
- Oh, hi.

24:14.880 --> 24:17.670
- I was just going
to say goodbye to Rayna.

24:17.670 --> 24:20.960
- Oh, so you're off then?
- Yeah. I leave tonight.

24:20.960 --> 24:22.380
- Where to?

24:22.380 --> 24:26.290
- Barcelona, film festival,
and then on to New York.

24:26.290 --> 24:27.960
I'm doing a commercial.

24:27.960 --> 24:30.750
- Oh, wow.
Well, safe travels.

24:30.750 --> 24:33.210
- Yeah.

24:33.210 --> 24:38.540
- Actually, no. I want to
thank you for everything.

24:40.620 --> 24:42.920
- Still ever so formal.

24:42.920 --> 24:45.880
- Yeah, that's me, I guess.

24:45.880 --> 24:49.580
- Scarlett,
prepare yourself.

24:49.580 --> 24:52.250
I don't think you know how much
your world is about to change.

24:52.250 --> 24:53.920
- Oh, yeah. I can't even
go there right now, nope.

24:53.920 --> 24:56.420
- Well, just promise me
you'll stay open.

24:56.420 --> 24:58.170
I think all kinds
of wonderful things

24:58.170 --> 25:00.330
are gonna start happening
for you.

25:00.330 --> 25:02.170
- Thanks.

25:02.170 --> 25:03.710
- Don't thank me.
I didn't do anything.

25:03.710 --> 25:05.210
You did it.

25:05.210 --> 25:06.420
- Oh...

25:20.420 --> 25:21.920
- Goodbye, Scarlett.

25:21.920 --> 25:23.960
- Bye.

25:32.880 --> 25:35.040
- Okay, rolling.

25:35.040 --> 25:37.460
- So, Daphne,
what is it like

25:37.460 --> 25:41.250
having your Mom and Dad
work on an album together?

25:41.250 --> 25:42.880
- Not fun.

25:42.880 --> 25:44.250
- Why not?

25:44.250 --> 25:47.460
- It looks hard being married
and working together.

25:47.460 --> 25:49.920
It looks like quite
the challenge,

25:49.920 --> 25:51.750
artistically, I mean.

25:51.750 --> 25:53.880
Everyone
has their own vision,

25:53.880 --> 25:55.330
but they do it better
than anyone else can

25:55.330 --> 25:58.710
because they really do
love each other,

25:58.710 --> 26:01.670
even though sometimes
it seems like they don't.

26:01.670 --> 26:05.540
- What's that like when it
doesn't seem like it's working?

26:05.540 --> 26:07.380
What's that like?

26:07.380 --> 26:09.880
- I don't...

26:14.620 --> 26:16.380
Can we cut here?

26:16.380 --> 26:19.880
- It was a good idea coming
up here for inspiration.

26:19.880 --> 26:22.580
- Yeah.
Did you get any yet?

26:22.580 --> 26:24.330
- No.
- Me, neither.

26:24.330 --> 26:27.210
It used to be so easy for us
to write together.

26:27.210 --> 26:29.790
- It was so easy.
- What happened?

26:29.790 --> 26:31.250
- I don't know.

26:31.250 --> 26:33.420
- You think maybe
it's 'cause we got married

26:33.420 --> 26:36.710
and domesticated each other
or something?

26:36.710 --> 26:39.880
- No. I mean, day-to-day,

26:39.880 --> 26:41.880
it can take
something out of you.

26:41.880 --> 26:43.460
But something's changed.

26:43.460 --> 26:46.670
Clearly we're not able
to just get down to it

26:46.670 --> 26:47.790
like we used to.

26:47.790 --> 26:49.460
- Yeah.

26:49.460 --> 26:52.120
- Maybe we just need to go off
on our own for a little bit.

26:52.120 --> 26:56.120
Just write individually,
come back, see what we got.

26:56.120 --> 26:59.210
- You want to write
a duet album individually?

26:59.210 --> 27:00.920
- It couldn't hurt,
you know.

27:00.920 --> 27:02.040
I mean,
look where we are here.

27:02.040 --> 27:03.420
- Honey,
you're so good at this.

27:03.420 --> 27:05.750
- I'm so good at what,
Rayna?

27:05.750 --> 27:08.040
- Quitting.

27:08.040 --> 27:09.420
- I'm not quitting.

27:09.420 --> 27:10.830
I didn't say anything
about quitting, all right?

27:10.830 --> 27:12.000
That's not fair because--

27:12.000 --> 27:13.670
- When things get real,
you get gone.

27:13.670 --> 27:15.080
- Oh, my--

27:15.080 --> 27:17.040
Is that really
where you are right now?

27:17.040 --> 27:18.330
Is that where you are?

27:18.330 --> 27:19.790
How far back
do you wanna go, huh?

27:19.790 --> 27:20.540
You wanna go back to Maddie?

27:20.540 --> 27:21.620
You wanna go back
to the drinking?

27:21.620 --> 27:22.830
You wanna go back
to our bad parents?

27:22.830 --> 27:24.380
- I don't wanna
go back to all of it.

27:24.380 --> 27:25.620
I don't wanna
be afraid of it.

27:25.620 --> 27:27.290
I don't wanna be afraid
of who we are, you know.

27:27.290 --> 27:29.420
I wanna be able
to touch our pain

27:29.420 --> 27:31.080
without having
to hurt each other.

27:31.080 --> 27:33.040
- Yeah, well,
clearly we can't, you know.

27:33.040 --> 27:34.580
And by the way, I said that
from the very beginning.

27:34.580 --> 27:35.960
I didn't wanna do this
for exactly the--

27:35.960 --> 27:36.960
- Now you're yelling.

27:36.960 --> 27:38.500
- I'm not--

27:40.040 --> 27:43.710
I don't mean to yell.

27:43.710 --> 27:45.330
I just don't wanna do this.

27:45.330 --> 27:47.210
- I don't wanna
do this either.

27:47.210 --> 27:49.040
I don't wanna
have to go back

27:49.040 --> 27:52.040
into our patterns
and our drama and our...

27:59.920 --> 28:03.920
And I sure as hell
don't wanna lose us.

28:06.120 --> 28:08.620
- So you tell me, Rayna.

28:10.710 --> 28:12.960
What do we do?

28:12.960 --> 28:15.960
How do we do this?

28:18.420 --> 28:21.040
- I don't know.

28:39.830 --> 28:42.040
- Where's the sugar?

28:49.460 --> 28:51.210
Thanks.

28:51.210 --> 28:53.500
- So here we have it,
ladies and gentlemen.

28:53.500 --> 28:56.710
We note a new development at
the Jaymes/Claybourne household.

28:56.710 --> 28:58.500
Our parents
are no longer speaking.

28:58.500 --> 29:00.710
- We're speaking.
- We're speaking.

29:00.710 --> 29:02.920
- No.

29:02.920 --> 29:05.250
Gene?

29:07.920 --> 29:09.170
- You wanna stay in tonight?

29:09.170 --> 29:12.040
Avery's heading over
to Juliette's.

29:12.040 --> 29:13.380
- Yeah, sure.

29:15.790 --> 29:20.170
- So you didn't tell me how your
dinner date went with Damien.

29:20.170 --> 29:21.830
- It was fun.

29:24.790 --> 29:26.580
- Fun?

29:26.580 --> 29:28.960
That's a good word.
It's descriptive.

29:28.960 --> 29:32.830
- Well, it was dinner.

29:32.830 --> 29:35.330
- You okay?

29:37.080 --> 29:39.750
- Gunnar, I gotta tell you
something,

29:39.750 --> 29:44.330
and I don't want you
to react.

29:44.330 --> 29:48.750
- At all? Sounds
impossible, but, okay.

29:50.500 --> 29:52.620
- I felt something
for Damien.

29:54.330 --> 29:56.830
I don't know what it was,
but...

29:56.830 --> 30:00.210
- That's not exactly
breaking news, Scarlett.

30:00.210 --> 30:02.830
The question is, what
are you gonna do about it?

30:02.830 --> 30:06.120
- What do you mean?
Oh, nothing. He's gone.

30:06.120 --> 30:07.580
- Oh, right.
So because he's gone,

30:07.580 --> 30:09.710
that means nothing's
gonna happen now, right?

30:09.710 --> 30:11.330
- No, of course not.

30:11.330 --> 30:14.580
This whole thing's been
really confusing for me,

30:14.580 --> 30:20.290
and whatever it was about,
it's over. Really.

30:20.290 --> 30:21.290
- So you thought
you felt something,

30:21.290 --> 30:22.420
but now it's over

30:22.420 --> 30:24.540
and I'm supposed
to believe that.

30:24.540 --> 30:26.330
- Yes.

30:28.170 --> 30:30.170
- ( sighs )

30:30.170 --> 30:31.620
- I'm being honest with you.

30:31.620 --> 30:34.170
- I know, but how do you
expect me to react?

30:34.170 --> 30:38.250
I mean,
I can't do this right now.

30:45.830 --> 30:47.710
- Hey.
- Hey.

30:50.000 --> 30:51.670
- Oh, my God.

30:51.670 --> 30:55.170
I remember when you could never
fall asleep without this doll.

30:55.170 --> 30:56.210
- It was yours,

30:56.210 --> 30:57.790
and you cut off
all of her hair

30:57.790 --> 30:59.170
and then gave it to me.

30:59.170 --> 31:01.330
- She does look pretty lame.

31:01.330 --> 31:03.790
Sorry about that.

31:03.790 --> 31:09.830
So Mom said I upset you
by bringing Clay over.

31:09.830 --> 31:11.790
- Why would I be upset?

31:11.790 --> 31:13.750
- Well, I don't know.

31:13.750 --> 31:16.580
I just don't want you to
feel confused, that's all.

31:16.580 --> 31:18.880
- And why
would I be confused?

31:18.880 --> 31:25.620
- Because, you know, Clay and I,
we're older and we...

31:25.620 --> 31:27.080
- Does it hurt?

31:27.080 --> 31:30.920
- Does what hurt?

31:30.920 --> 31:33.830
- Being in love.

31:33.830 --> 31:36.830
- Sometimes.

31:36.830 --> 31:38.830
- Yeah, I thought so.

31:38.830 --> 31:40.170
It kind of looks that way.

31:40.170 --> 31:41.500
- Really?
Is it that obvious?

31:41.500 --> 31:44.880
- Yeah. I mean,
it just seems to make everyone

31:44.880 --> 31:46.330
act a little bit crazy.

31:46.330 --> 31:49.500
Well, maybe
just around here.

31:49.500 --> 31:51.670
- It's kind of hard
to describe.

31:51.670 --> 31:53.040
- Try me.

31:53.040 --> 31:57.040
- Well, it feels like...

31:57.040 --> 32:01.540
like you've sewn someone else's
skin on top of yours,

32:01.540 --> 32:04.000
and you can never
take it off

32:04.000 --> 32:07.880
without feeling like you've
just been ripped apart.

32:37.960 --> 32:41.170
( doorknob rattles )

33:37.790 --> 33:40.330
( door opens )

34:02.460 --> 34:04.710
- You hardly slept.

34:04.710 --> 34:06.830
- That's okay.

34:06.830 --> 34:09.000
- Honey, I thought
it was gonna be easy

34:09.000 --> 34:11.170
for us to write our story.

34:11.170 --> 34:14.080
- It wasn't easy
to live it.

34:14.080 --> 34:16.170
Why should it be easy
to tell it?

34:16.170 --> 34:17.580
- And, you know,
I think maybe

34:17.580 --> 34:21.540
everything happened
the way it needed to for us.

34:21.540 --> 34:25.120
- Yeah. Maybe if we'd
gotten together back then,

34:25.120 --> 34:29.290
we'd have thrown
each other away by now.

34:29.290 --> 34:34.000
- All I know is
I'm here right now,

34:34.000 --> 34:36.920
and I'm not going
anywhere ever.

34:36.920 --> 34:39.580
- Don't you dare.

34:39.580 --> 34:42.620
You're my favorite
hurricane.

34:42.620 --> 34:45.080
I wrote something
for you last night.

34:45.080 --> 34:48.460
- That's funny. I wrote
something for you last night.

34:48.460 --> 34:49.920
- You did?
- Yeah.

34:49.920 --> 34:51.080
- What'd you write?

34:51.080 --> 34:52.290
- Well, I wanna hear
yours first.

34:52.290 --> 34:54.000
- No, no.
I wanna hear yours first.

34:54.000 --> 34:56.080
- Well, I just have lyrics.
I don't really have music.

34:56.080 --> 34:57.580
- Well, come on,
let's hear 'em.

34:57.580 --> 34:59.580
- All right.

34:59.580 --> 35:01.040
- What do you got?

35:03.460 --> 35:05.290
- Okay.

35:05.290 --> 35:08.920
I never questioned,
not even once

35:08.920 --> 35:13.080
all of the twists and turns
and tumbles of our love--

35:13.080 --> 35:16.000
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

35:16.000 --> 35:18.210
Oh, my God, Rayna.

35:18.210 --> 35:19.290
- What?

35:20.920 --> 35:22.670
- Watch this.

35:22.670 --> 35:25.250
It fits
what I wrote perfectly.

35:25.250 --> 35:26.790
