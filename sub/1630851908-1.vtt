I'm not doing it again.

with all gay guys

08:09.406 --> 08:10.449
for the past year.

08:10.490 --> 08:11.450

- Yeah, you really have.

08:11.491 --> 08:13.076
- Yeah, for sure.

08:13.118 --> 08:14.953

08:20.626 --> 08:22.544
- Or anything that I should be
preparing for mentally?

08:22.586 --> 08:24.713
- Bri and Haley are
hosting, like, a Y2K party.

08:24.755 --> 08:27.174
- I got an invite.
- Oh, yeah. It's for sure.

08:27.216 --> 08:28.258

I didn't know what it was for.

fucking..."

Shiva's birthday.

08:33.764 --> 08:34.723
at Haley and Brianna's house.

08:34.765 --> 08:36.475
They have parties pretty often.

08:36.516 --> 08:38.685
It's a theme party,
it's usually what they do.

08:38.727 --> 08:41.480
I think that they definitely,
umm, like to have those

08:41.521 --> 08:44.191
kind of parties so they can
control the guest list.

08:44.233 --> 08:45.776

to show off their things.

we're always a good vibe,

10:29.296 --> 10:31.423

their own insecurities

It's no secret that

the queen bees

31:58.417 --> 31:59.877
- We good?
- We're good.

31:59.918 --> 32:02.171
- Are we good with that?
Are we good with that?

32:02.212 --> 32:03.172
We're going to leave
it at that?

32:03.213 --> 32:05.174
- All right.
- Okay.

32:05.215 --> 32:07.468
You're telling me we're
friends but you're kissing me.

32:07.509 --> 32:09.303
I don't know how to read this.

32:09.345 --> 32:12.139
You're saying one thing and
doing the complete opposite.

32:13.223 --> 32:15.684
Fuck it.
Like, I got to move on.

32:15.726 --> 32:18.145
I feel like Shiva is kind
of taking things the wrong way.

32:18.187 --> 32:20.564
That's definitely not,
I was about to say

32:20.606 --> 32:21.732
partially my fault.

32:21.774 --> 32:23.651
No, it's 100 percent my fault.

32:23.692 --> 32:25.277
I'm not trying to like fucking
hurt her feelings or anything,

32:25.319 --> 32:26.737
but I'm just, like, not
looking for anything,

32:26.779 --> 32:29.239
I'm just having a good time.

32:29.281 --> 32:30.616
I feel like my whole life
I've always, like,

32:30.658 --> 32:32.493
jumped relationship
to relationship.

32:32.534 --> 32:35.746
It's time for me to have a fresh
start so I can do things right.

32:36.955 --> 32:38.499
- We're going to the bathroom.

32:38.540 --> 32:42.711
[overlapping chatter]

32:42.753 --> 32:43.921
- Okay, what's happening?

32:43.962 --> 32:46.757
[Cuppie]: Bitch, shut the door.

32:46.799 --> 32:47.800
[Summer]: We've got to
get out of here.

32:47.841 --> 32:48.801
Nelly and Ali are in one seat.

32:48.842 --> 32:50.260
Cuppie's in the other.

32:50.302 --> 32:51.929
[Marissa]: Who else did we...
promise to...?

32:51.970 --> 32:52.930
[Summer]: I'm not gonna
say it again. We gotta go.

32:52.971 --> 32:53.972
[Cuppie]: Where are we going?

32:54.014 --> 32:55.683
[Summer]: White Lie.

32:55.724 --> 32:57.393
I'm one of those people where
you go to a house party

32:57.434 --> 32:58.727
I wanna leave and
go out to the bar.

32:58.769 --> 33:00.562
Usually, that's
the pre-game to me.

33:00.604 --> 33:04.024
- Yeah, I feel like we did our
time. Like, you go to a party,

33:04.066 --> 33:05.818
- Sorry.
- and you make an appearance

33:05.859 --> 33:07.277
and you do your time.

33:07.319 --> 33:10.447
- All right,
so I'm calling an Uber.

33:10.489 --> 33:12.700
- All right, we're all going
to see each other out?

33:12.741 --> 33:14.702
Babe, where's my fan?

33:14.743 --> 33:15.828
- I love you.
- White Lie?

33:15.869 --> 33:19.164
- White Lie?
- Bye, bitch.

33:19.206 --> 33:21.417
[Brianna]: It started with
a whisper, like,

33:21.458 --> 33:22.835
"Hey, let's go to the bar."

33:22.876 --> 33:24.670
And then it went from a
quiet whisper to, like,

33:24.712 --> 33:27.381
trying to herd fucking cattle.

33:27.423 --> 33:29.425
I just know that
it's disrespectful to me

33:29.466 --> 33:31.760
and my house, and of course,
Haley,

33:31.802 --> 33:33.637
because if she wants
to open up her home,

33:33.679 --> 33:35.597
and they just kind of come
and shit all over that.

33:35.639 --> 33:38.517
- You want to talk to me or no?
You want to talk over this way?

33:38.559 --> 33:40.060
- I don't want to give anybody
any satisfaction.

33:40.102 --> 33:42.813
- That's fine. You want
to talk anywhere else?

33:42.855 --> 33:45.065
- No. I want everybody
to go fuck themselves.

33:45.107 --> 33:48.610
- Everybody, an Uber XL
is six people.

33:48.652 --> 33:50.404
There's, like, 12 of us.

33:50.446 --> 33:52.156
- Sure you don't want to
go out drinking with us?

33:52.197 --> 33:53.615
- No.
- Enjoy your night.

33:53.657 --> 33:55.451
- Thank you.

33:55.492 --> 33:58.370
- There's a weird competition
between Summer and Marissa

33:58.412 --> 33:59.830
and Murphy and Haley.

33:59.872 --> 34:02.332
There's definitely
a lot of hostility,

34:02.374 --> 34:06.211
underlying deep rooted issues,
I feel like.

34:06.253 --> 34:09.298
I'm not entirely sure
where it stems from.

34:09.339 --> 34:11.425
[Brianna]: Marissa, don't make
the mistake of driving

34:11.467 --> 34:13.677
with, like, a drink
in your system.

34:13.719 --> 34:15.387
- You think that I
went to school,

34:15.429 --> 34:17.806
...busted my ass to become a
fucking nurse

34:17.848 --> 34:19.933
...so I could fucking risk it
for this shit?

34:19.975 --> 34:21.393
- Oh, my God.
- She didn't fucking drink.

34:21.435 --> 34:23.270
I didn't go and get fucking
trashed.

34:23.312 --> 34:24.730
- Back up!
- I'm sorry.

34:24.772 --> 34:25.981
Don't be a child
and take your anger out

34:26.023 --> 34:27.816
on where it belongs.
Come at me.

34:27.858 --> 34:29.443
If we walk out and people follow
us, that's not my problem.

34:29.485 --> 34:32.154
You don't compete where you
can't compare.

34:32.196 --> 34:33.906
- I just know that we were
supposed to go to the bar.

34:33.947 --> 34:36.325
We're trying to call
Ubers and Lyfts,

34:36.366 --> 34:39.995
and I think some words
were exchanged.

34:40.037 --> 34:42.080
[Cuppie]: That's a mess.

34:42.122 --> 34:44.082
I feel like there's always,
like, an abrupt ending

34:44.124 --> 34:45.793
to parties at Murph's
and Haley's.

34:45.834 --> 34:46.919
That's, like, our norm.

34:46.960 --> 34:48.921
- Okay, adios amigos.

34:48.962 --> 34:51.048
♪♪

34:56.094 --> 35:00.015
[Mack]: We get into an Uber.
I'm sitting next to Summer.

35:00.057 --> 35:02.643
She's, like going off,
popping off,

35:02.684 --> 35:05.229
loud about Bri and Haley.

35:05.270 --> 35:07.189
I'm not going to hang out
with someone in their home,

35:07.231 --> 35:10.609
chill with them, kumbaya, and
then, like, five seconds later

35:10.651 --> 35:12.486
be like, "Oh, f that. Boo."

35:12.528 --> 35:14.696
Like, Brianna and Haley,
those are my babies.

35:14.738 --> 35:16.240
You can save that
after the car ride

35:16.281 --> 35:17.950
because it's making me
uncomfortable.

35:17.991 --> 35:20.285
I think it's making everyone
else uncomfortable.

35:20.327 --> 35:22.037
Y'all need to
chill the hell out.

35:22.079 --> 35:25.582
So Shiva's in the backseat
and she decided

35:25.624 --> 35:28.460
to pull out her phone
without telling me.

35:28.502 --> 35:29.503
[Mack]: You want me to shut the
fuck up...

35:29.545 --> 35:30.963
...and not say nothing back?

35:31.004 --> 35:33.382
I don't. I honestly, I'm so...

35:33.423 --> 35:35.926
You don't know me
and I don't know you...

35:35.968 --> 35:37.386
...and I have
not disrespected you.

35:37.427 --> 35:39.179
[Summer]: I haven't
disrespected you either.

35:39.221 --> 35:42.182
[Mack]: So I feel like you are,
and when I say you have

35:42.224 --> 35:45.519
gotten very hostile and that's
because my energy is very chill.

35:45.561 --> 35:48.772
[Mack]: For you to come
aggressive at me, I am a very
chill person.

35:48.814 --> 35:52.401
- So, I feel like right now...
- Shut the fuck up.

35:52.442 --> 35:55.904
Because I'm caught off guard.
[woman]: Sarah, Sarah,

35:55.946 --> 35:57.781
[woman]: Sarah, Sarah...
[Summer]: Oh, my God.

35:57.823 --> 35:59.575
I got into the Uber
and was talking

35:59.616 --> 36:01.285
about what just happened 10
seconds prior.

36:01.326 --> 36:03.245
But apparently, when you're
upset about something

36:03.287 --> 36:04.788
that's currently happening
in real-time,

36:04.830 --> 36:06.039
you're being hostile.

36:06.081 --> 36:07.249
- Summer was going off,

36:07.291 --> 36:09.626
like 70 percent of the car ride.

36:09.668 --> 36:11.378
- Seemed like she just wanted
to say her two cents...

36:11.420 --> 36:13.171
- Hear her voice.
- ...and then

36:13.213 --> 36:15.674
and then not hear anything
coming out of our mouths.

36:15.716 --> 36:17.050
Like, eighty percent,
she did not stop,

36:17.092 --> 36:18.385
and it's just too much.

36:18.427 --> 36:19.761
I was overwhelmed.

36:19.803 --> 36:21.597
I don't think Mack knows
our history

36:21.638 --> 36:23.307
with Brianna and Haley.

36:23.348 --> 36:24.433
You don't
know what's going on,

36:24.474 --> 36:26.226
you don't know dah, dah, dah.

36:26.268 --> 36:28.437
I'm like, no. Quite frankly,
I don't want to know.

36:28.478 --> 36:30.689
[Mack]: I'm very, very
chill, bro.

36:30.731 --> 36:32.941
[Cuppie]: It's not, it's
not hostile.

36:32.983 --> 36:34.651
[Mack]: I haven't disrespected
nobody.

36:34.693 --> 36:36.069
[Mack]: I haven't crossed a
line.

36:36.111 --> 36:39.907
[woman]: Wait, wait, wait.
Oh, Lord, Jesus Christ.

36:39.948 --> 36:41.491
I recorded not just to be like,

36:41.533 --> 36:43.035
"Ooh, let me get what she's
saying,"

36:43.076 --> 36:44.786
or something like that.
It was just, like, funny.

36:44.828 --> 36:46.872
Like, I'm just chilling like,
"What's going on?"

36:46.914 --> 36:49.583
I mean, I would probably stick
up for my friends too but...

36:49.625 --> 36:51.501
If my friends we
were worth sticking up for.

36:51.543 --> 36:53.337
[Summer]: Just shut the
fuck up for one sec.

36:56.048 --> 36:57.549
- Are y'all bitches ready?

36:57.591 --> 36:59.885
[laughter]

36:59.927 --> 37:01.094
[cheering]

37:01.136 --> 37:02.387
Sorry that I'm stressed.

37:02.429 --> 37:03.388
But our friends are
getting engaged.

37:03.430 --> 37:05.182
[sirens, screaming]

37:05.223 --> 37:07.100
- Cuppie with her fucking mimosa
and fan, though.

37:07.142 --> 37:08.560
I'm not that type of lesbian.

37:08.602 --> 37:09.686
- Give us some noise!

37:09.728 --> 37:11.396
[cheering]

37:11.438 --> 37:13.148
I've been watering a
plant that's not real.

37:13.190 --> 37:16.360
[laughter]

37:16.401 --> 37:17.736
- Mom, how do you say
gay in Farsi?

37:17.778 --> 37:19.446
[woman]: Gay, I don't know.

37:19.488 --> 37:21.406
- To not even know a word for it
because that's literally

37:21.448 --> 37:23.116
how much they don't
talk about it.

37:23.158 --> 37:26.203
My parents thought that
therapy would take it out of me.

37:26.244 --> 37:29.915
No one is going
to tell me who I am.

37:29.957 --> 37:32.334
God never rejected you.

37:32.376 --> 37:33.919
- This is the first time
anyone's put this on since

37:33.961 --> 37:35.212
she passed away.

37:35.253 --> 37:36.755
- I am trying
so hard to not cry.

37:36.797 --> 37:38.423
All this stuff
that's been going on

37:38.465 --> 37:40.050
has been making me
more anxious.

37:40.092 --> 37:41.343
[Jordan]: Do you like her?

37:41.385 --> 37:43.929
- I got to move with caution.
- Why?

37:43.971 --> 37:45.597
Because she's straight.

37:45.639 --> 37:47.808
[cheering]

37:47.849 --> 37:49.518
That's good.
They need that moment

37:49.559 --> 37:51.228
to, like, try to prove their
relationship is good.

37:51.269 --> 37:53.814
[laughter]

37:53.855 --> 37:55.023
Never been to jail.

37:55.065 --> 37:56.441
It's not fun.

37:56.483 --> 37:57.818
[Olivia]: I totaled my fucking
Jeep pretty bad.

37:57.859 --> 37:59.069
- Yeah. They told me you did.

37:59.111 --> 38:00.487
They told me it's not drivable.

38:00.529 --> 38:02.447
[Olivia]: I really fucked up.

38:02.489 --> 38:04.574
I think you're a snake, and
I don't trust anything you say.

38:04.616 --> 38:06.243
That is so, like,
high school, it's so childish.

38:06.284 --> 38:08.453
- When people start getting
like that it like...

38:08.495 --> 38:10.372
- Triggers you.

38:10.414 --> 38:13.333
I don't like how they treat
people and it's not okay.

38:13.375 --> 38:15.419
This isn't a Miss Congeniality
contest.

38:15.460 --> 38:17.629
You come at them,
I have a problem.

38:17.671 --> 38:19.214
- I'm honestly about to
rip a bitch's hair out,

38:19.256 --> 38:21.258
so she needs to fucking shut up.

38:21.299 --> 38:24.302
- There's obviously tension.
- Tension.

38:24.344 --> 38:26.555
They're always fucking
scheming some shit.

38:26.596 --> 38:28.181
Run like you always do.
You're fake as fuck.

38:28.223 --> 38:29.599
- She's trying
to act like

38:29.641 --> 38:31.268
there's something
sinister going on.

38:31.309 --> 38:33.061
- Yo, what's the conversation?

38:33.103 --> 38:36.982
We will always hear your side
but if that is not reciprocated,

38:37.024 --> 38:38.400
I will close the door fast.

38:40.402 --> 38:41.653
- Is that what's going on
now, bitch?

38:41.695 --> 38:44.114
[screaming]

38:44.156 --> 38:46.742
- This is the most action
I've had in four months.

38:46.783 --> 38:48.326
[laughter]
