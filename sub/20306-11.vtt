00:01.042 --> 00:03.336
NARRATOR:
<i>Previously on </i>Hill Street Blues...

00:03.420 --> 00:04.379
What's the delay?

00:04.462 --> 00:07.215
Fat man, you just waded
knee-deep into dog business.

00:07.298 --> 00:08.341
What's a taste?

00:08.425 --> 00:10.176
Thirty... 12 for the room.

00:11.469 --> 00:12.637
Sorry, kid, I'm a cop.

00:12.721 --> 00:14.973
-Jesus...
-What? Am I E.F. Hutton?

00:15.056 --> 00:16.975
My apprentice. Can we help you
with something, Captain?

00:17.058 --> 00:18.268
Do you have family, Carla?

00:18.560 --> 00:21.021
A father.
He's the one ought to be locked up.

00:21.104 --> 00:23.106
This is a man
with an elaborate medical history.

00:23.189 --> 00:24.190
What do you want from me?

00:24.274 --> 00:27.110
I want you to be more responsible
for the way you act towards me!

00:27.193 --> 00:28.486
MAN: Who was this guy anyway?

00:28.570 --> 00:29.946
MAN 2: Paul "The Wall" Scrignoli.

00:30.989 --> 00:33.241
-Gina!
-He's alive!

00:33.324 --> 00:35.452
I want us to stop seeing each other, Mick.

00:37.787 --> 00:39.164
(laughter)

00:39.247 --> 00:43.543
Item 5, the miracle is over.

00:44.127 --> 00:48.465
Paul "The Wall" Scrignoli
died last night at Mercy Hospital.

00:48.548 --> 00:49.966
(cheering)

00:50.050 --> 00:51.968
STAN: This is a repeat performance

00:52.343 --> 00:55.972
of when he apparently expired
last week at Hill Street,

00:56.056 --> 00:59.309
only to revive and speak the name
of his beloved

00:59.392 --> 01:00.935
several hours later.

01:01.019 --> 01:02.729
Gina!

01:02.812 --> 01:04.856
(laughter)

01:04.939 --> 01:08.276
Now, the doctor's theory
was that Mr. Scrignoli's heart

01:08.359 --> 01:10.278
didn't stop the first time.

01:10.361 --> 01:13.323
It just couldn't be detected
under all his rolls of fat.

01:13.406 --> 01:15.533
-(laughter)
-Whatever!

01:15.617 --> 01:18.244
Paul "The Wall" lives no more.

01:18.328 --> 01:19.412
(laughing)

01:19.496 --> 01:22.999
Item 6, two drive-by shootings last night

01:23.374 --> 01:25.126
at Shamrock headquarters,

01:25.710 --> 01:28.213
one wounded, no witnesses.

01:28.463 --> 01:32.717
Also, we've got an intelligence report
from gang intervention

01:33.093 --> 01:35.887
giving us the straight poop on the war.

01:37.180 --> 01:39.307
"This is a move by the Blood,

01:39.390 --> 01:42.602
"sometimes supported by Mau-Mau,
into Shamrock turf.

01:43.311 --> 01:47.065
"The Blood appear
to have superior numbers and morale

01:47.148 --> 01:50.527
and appear to be able to back their move."

01:51.194 --> 01:54.989
Now, Lieutenant, uh,
Goldblume continues to coordinate.

01:55.073 --> 01:59.077
He requests that all patrols
double their pass-bys

01:59.160 --> 02:02.205
near both headquarters
and the Duffy Green.

02:02.288 --> 02:03.414
(man coughs)

02:03.498 --> 02:05.542
Seven and eight.

02:06.376 --> 02:08.545
Now, seven is a hooker cleanout

02:08.628 --> 02:10.839
at the, uh,
at our end of the river tunnel.

02:11.297 --> 02:14.759
Detectives Gallagher and Munsey,
uh, Mayo and Garibaldi--

02:14.843 --> 02:17.428
Hey, is, uh, is Harry comin' in, Pats?

02:17.512 --> 02:20.014
Oh, yeah, he's on Garibaldi Standard Time.

02:20.098 --> 02:22.267
(laughter)

02:22.350 --> 02:25.687
Eight is, uh, Mike Belker's
narcotics undercover

02:25.770 --> 02:29.732
at the Salon Denise, 114 and Lamont.

02:29.816 --> 02:32.861
Ooh, zing went the strings of my heart.

02:32.944 --> 02:38.158
(laughter)

02:38.241 --> 02:42.620
Now, both operations
want a way to Oswaldo Rincon.

02:43.246 --> 02:47.041
He's, um, he's usin' the hookers
to mule his smack,

02:47.500 --> 02:49.919
and apparently, he's also distributing

02:50.003 --> 02:52.172
through his, uh, beauty salon.

02:52.255 --> 02:56.217
Detectives Kramer and Lane
out of Ferry are working stakeout,

02:56.301 --> 02:57.927
Mike, on Rincon's apartment,

02:58.011 --> 02:59.929
that is, if you want
to touch base with them.

03:01.639 --> 03:02.473
Uh...

03:03.600 --> 03:04.475
Item nine.

03:05.560 --> 03:09.272
Yeah, we got new automatic hand dryers
in both genders' johns.

03:09.355 --> 03:10.190
MAN: Yay!

03:10.273 --> 03:13.401
Now, these machines dry better
than the paper towels,

03:13.651 --> 03:14.986
and they're germ-free.

03:15.361 --> 03:18.239
Plus, we don't have
to stack the new towels,

03:18.323 --> 03:20.450
and we don't have
to dispose of the old ones.

03:20.533 --> 03:22.911
And each machine is an annual saving

03:22.994 --> 03:25.872
of two and a half acres of virgin forest.

03:25.955 --> 03:27.582
-(laughter)
-That's it. That's why.

03:27.665 --> 03:30.960
Let's try to use this
new equipment properly, people.

03:31.044 --> 03:34.297
It took me about
18 requisitions to get it.

03:34.380 --> 03:36.758
Do you use the over-and-over
drying method,

03:36.841 --> 03:38.968
or the vigorous side-to-side--

03:39.052 --> 03:41.638
-Shut up!
-(laughter)

03:42.680 --> 03:44.599
This last item's not a happy one.

03:45.934 --> 03:48.228
It's a memo from Division.

03:50.480 --> 03:52.106
"Until the first of the year,

03:52.398 --> 03:55.693
"the sergeant of the watch
will approve overtime

03:55.777 --> 03:58.196
on an emergencies-only basis."

03:58.279 --> 04:00.615
(groaning)

04:01.366 --> 04:04.661
"Such approval is to be subject
to Command review."

04:04.994 --> 04:06.663
What the hell is that
supposed to mean, Sarge?

04:06.955 --> 04:11.709
<i>That </i>means that Division ran out of budget
for overtime, Andrew.

04:12.710 --> 04:14.003
Figure your, uh...

04:14.587 --> 04:16.714
figure your Christmas lists accordingly.

04:16.798 --> 04:18.216
MAN: Aw, man!

04:18.299 --> 04:21.803
Now, no use cryin'
over spilled milk. Let's roll!

04:22.720 --> 04:25.014
Let's do it to them
before they do it to us.

04:25.723 --> 04:27.767
We already got done to, didn't we?

04:27.850 --> 04:31.062
(indistinct conversations)

04:32.438 --> 04:34.732
All right, suppose the shift's over,
we're out on a call.

04:34.816 --> 04:36.651
-Yeah.
-Are they gonna call that an emergency?

04:36.734 --> 04:38.403
They're gonna call that
"work with no pay."

04:38.778 --> 04:40.780
Belker, Sarge, I got a 2-11--

04:40.863 --> 04:42.740
-Got it.
-Your mother on three.

04:42.824 --> 04:46.369
Renegotiate, that's the only way
to protect our overtime rights.

04:47.245 --> 04:49.414
-Mornin', Lieutenant.
-Good morning.

04:49.497 --> 04:51.958
Pats, Pats. Look, I'm sorry I'm late.

04:52.041 --> 04:54.460
I got a Constitutional Law paper
that's gonna kill me.

04:54.961 --> 04:56.379
You'd better take a number.

04:56.879 --> 04:59.799
Ma, everything is fine
with me and Robin, Ma.

05:01.134 --> 05:03.720
No, you're not. You're not
hearing anything in my voice.

05:04.304 --> 05:05.847
Ma, I gotta go.

05:07.598 --> 05:08.516
Malarkey!

05:09.225 --> 05:11.853
That's malarkey, Ma,
you can't always tell.

05:12.437 --> 05:13.271
Ma...

05:13.855 --> 05:14.689
Ma?

05:15.064 --> 05:15.898
Ma!

05:17.442 --> 05:20.236
I will see if our schedules permit us
to come to dinner,

05:20.320 --> 05:21.654
and I will call you back.

05:22.238 --> 05:24.449
-(indistinct chatter)
-I am fine!

05:24.532 --> 05:26.409
Will you stop telling me what I'm feeling?

05:26.492 --> 05:27.327
(slams phone)

05:28.786 --> 05:31.331
Here's the Ferry stakeout code call, Mike.

05:32.874 --> 05:34.500
You like it when people call you "Jabo"?

05:35.501 --> 05:37.295
-Not much.
-Take a hint.

05:40.256 --> 05:41.507
What's the matter with Mike?

05:41.966 --> 05:45.470
Yeah, the, uh,
papers for Constitutional Law 101.

05:45.970 --> 05:48.681
That's<i> Marbury v. Madison</i>
and the Separation of Powers.

05:49.932 --> 05:50.767
Right.

05:51.392 --> 05:52.560
So, what's that gonna run me?

05:54.270 --> 05:56.606
Oh, come on, who wrote the damn thing...
Justice Burger?

05:57.732 --> 05:59.650
(sighs) No, I gotta have it.

06:00.777 --> 06:01.652
How do I pick it up?

06:03.196 --> 06:05.114
Yeah, right,
I'm in the second row, and, uh,

06:05.198 --> 06:06.532
that's the last seat on the left.

06:08.493 --> 06:10.620
Wait, don't talk to me
about any package rates, pal.

06:10.703 --> 06:12.455
-This is one time only.
-MAN: Hey, wait a second.

06:13.498 --> 06:14.332
Right.

06:16.501 --> 06:17.335
(clears throat)

06:18.294 --> 06:20.630
Well, come on, Pats, let's get to work.

06:20.713 --> 06:21.672
That's funny, Harry.

06:22.215 --> 06:24.759
She does not think it's funny, Leo.
She is not amused.

06:24.842 --> 06:26.219
-(explosion)
-Fire!

06:26.302 --> 06:30.556
The blasted hand dryer
put my jacket on fire!

06:32.141 --> 06:34.602
The damn thing is not a coat hanger!

06:34.685 --> 06:35.812
All clear, sir. All clear.

06:36.396 --> 06:37.688
Thank you, Ballantine.

06:37.772 --> 06:39.273
(indistinct conversations)

06:42.110 --> 06:42.944
Oh.

06:44.195 --> 06:46.239
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch. We have a 9-11.</i>

06:46.572 --> 06:48.324
<i>Armed robbery in progress.</i>

06:48.408 --> 06:52.203
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

06:52.286 --> 06:53.830
(sirens wailing)

06:59.293 --> 07:01.921
(theme music playing)

08:29.050 --> 08:29.884
(chuckles)

08:33.304 --> 08:34.514
WOMAN: Ooh, slow down.

08:36.516 --> 08:39.602
Hey, Pats, River and 120, north side.

08:39.685 --> 08:41.062
WOMAN: Backin' up for me, baby?

08:45.024 --> 08:47.527
Hey! Hey, Bubble Gum, come here.

08:51.447 --> 08:55.034
-Hi.
-Hi, how ya doin'? We workin' today?

08:55.117 --> 08:57.370
Yeah, you steer the car, I steer you--

08:57.453 --> 08:59.580
-Thirty bucks for the ride.
-All right, hop in.

09:02.500 --> 09:04.961
Okay, give me 30 bucks
and keep your eyes on the road.

09:05.044 --> 09:06.796
Now, you think real hard, Carla.

09:06.879 --> 09:07.880
Don't I look familiar?

09:09.090 --> 09:11.008
Oh, I'm not too good with faces.

09:11.092 --> 09:12.510
Let's see if anything else rings a bell.

09:12.593 --> 09:14.470
I busted you two months ago,
you little jerk,

09:14.554 --> 09:16.055
-just like I'm busting you now.
-Hey, wait a minute.

09:16.138 --> 09:16.973
-Wait, let me fix first.
-Hey, Pats,

09:17.056 --> 09:18.432
-we got a pick-up.
-I'll do you for free if you--

09:18.516 --> 09:19.433
<i>Great, Carla.</i>

09:19.517 --> 09:20.810
-Please.
-Save it.

09:20.893 --> 09:22.812
Oh, brother! (sobs)

09:23.062 --> 09:25.314
Oh, great, here come the faucets.

09:25.398 --> 09:26.649
(crying)

09:28.359 --> 09:29.694
(tires screeching)

09:30.987 --> 09:35.199
(siren wailing)

09:37.910 --> 09:38.953
Soliciting.

09:39.704 --> 09:40.705
PAT: Out of the car, kid.

09:43.457 --> 09:46.043
Hey, take it easy.
It's not the end of the world.

09:52.675 --> 09:53.509
Morning.

09:54.093 --> 09:56.637
Oh, Frank, good.
Terry Shaughnessy's in lineup.

10:05.438 --> 10:06.564
Terry?

10:06.897 --> 10:08.941
This is some kind of joke!

10:09.650 --> 10:11.986
-It's a proposal.
-It's a<i> surrender.</i>

10:12.403 --> 10:14.655
Keeps your old borders on three sides,
keeps your headquarters intact.

10:14.739 --> 10:16.657
Isn't there a consultancy position
in there?

10:16.741 --> 10:19.702
(laughs) So, when we cut
through all the crap,

10:19.785 --> 10:21.954
the Shamrocks are supposed
to roll over our turf

10:22.038 --> 10:23.539
to these spades, and I get bought off.

10:23.956 --> 10:25.583
You want to cut through
all the crap, Terry?

10:25.666 --> 10:28.127
You're an Irish gang
in a neighborhood that's turning Black.

10:28.544 --> 10:30.338
You're down to 20 active members max.

10:30.421 --> 10:33.507
-None of 'em's under 18.
-We're still in charge.

10:34.091 --> 10:35.885
Bloods still got to come through us.

10:36.344 --> 10:37.303
It's over, Terry.

10:37.970 --> 10:39.555
Why play it down to the last man?

10:40.389 --> 10:41.223
It ain't playin'...

10:45.645 --> 10:46.562
and it ain't over.

10:52.234 --> 10:53.653
That wreck's gonna happen, Henry.

10:53.736 --> 10:55.988
Mm-hmm. Morning, Fay.

10:56.072 --> 10:57.073
-Hi, Henry.
-Fay.

10:57.156 --> 10:59.784
Frank, are we still on for 12:15 lunch?

11:00.117 --> 11:01.952
-Sure.
-You forgot.

11:02.036 --> 11:03.788
12:15, uh, wasn't it something about, uh--

11:03.871 --> 11:05.998
It's something
for which we need to have lunch.

11:07.333 --> 11:09.126
-Captain.
-Morning, Stan.

11:09.210 --> 11:12.421
Um, regards your command review,
my overtime authorization.

11:13.172 --> 11:15.174
Manpower allocation is your call, Stan.

11:15.591 --> 11:16.676
There'll be no command review.

11:17.343 --> 11:19.512
Troops are a little ticked off
about the cutbacks.

11:20.096 --> 11:22.807
I don't blame 'em. Wasn't there some kind
of guarantee in the last contract?

11:22.890 --> 11:24.892
There was an informal understanding.

11:25.518 --> 11:27.561
I was an observer at the negotiations,

11:27.645 --> 11:29.814
but I had no bargaining power.

11:32.274 --> 11:33.109
Morning, Ray.

11:40.991 --> 11:43.869
(indistinct chatter)

11:49.709 --> 11:51.460
-What?
-I am so afraid!

11:51.919 --> 11:54.338
Now that dealer, Rincon,
can be so vicious.

11:54.422 --> 11:56.674
I've seen him put Leon
right up against a wall!

11:56.757 --> 11:58.634
-Will you calm down?
-(exhales)

11:59.927 --> 12:01.637
I just don't think
I can go through with this.

12:02.346 --> 12:04.598
Kenny, vouching from you is 95 percent
of this.

12:04.682 --> 12:07.184
All you gotta do now
is go about your business

12:07.268 --> 12:08.519
and let me do my job.

12:08.602 --> 12:09.562
Oh, easy for you to say!

12:09.645 --> 12:11.313
Would you rather do the 18 months?

12:14.608 --> 12:15.443
Hold me.

12:19.822 --> 12:22.116
Kenny, I know Michael's your friend,

12:22.742 --> 12:24.118
but we do have work to do.

12:27.663 --> 12:30.416
Michael, Mrs. Schacter.

12:30.499 --> 12:32.168
Mrs. Schacter, how are you today?

12:32.251 --> 12:33.169
Kenny...

12:34.128 --> 12:35.129
Mrs. Rosen.

12:38.007 --> 12:40.760
Rub-a-dub-dub, Mrs. Steinkamp.

12:40.843 --> 12:43.053
Get angry with that hair!

12:43.137 --> 12:44.430
Party to see you, Leon.

12:46.599 --> 12:47.808
The envelope's there for you, dear.

12:50.561 --> 12:51.854
Are we writing a novel, Michael?

12:54.982 --> 12:56.442
-(siren wails)
-WOMAN: I think that boy's dead.

12:56.525 --> 12:58.944
They were kicking him in his head.
I think they caved his head in.

12:59.028 --> 13:00.488
Did you see what they looked like, ma'am?

13:00.571 --> 13:02.281
Uh, the colored gang--

13:02.364 --> 13:04.784
they came in,
they said it was their store now.

13:04.867 --> 13:06.118
They started stuffing their pockets.

13:06.202 --> 13:08.454
Don-- Don tried to stop 'em.

13:08.537 --> 13:10.623
Uh, Shamrock boy came
from across the street.

13:10.706 --> 13:12.291
That's Shamrock headquarters.

13:13.667 --> 13:15.377
Uh, could you give us
a description, ma'am?

13:15.461 --> 13:17.713
No! No, no, no, she can't!

13:17.797 --> 13:19.465
You want to get me beaten again, Dory?

13:19.548 --> 13:21.091
Hey, sir, you got some broken ribs here.

13:21.175 --> 13:24.553
MAN: Oh, here's the big shot!
Here's the protector!

13:24.637 --> 13:26.764
-MAN 2: Take it easy. Easy.
- ...license number...

13:26.847 --> 13:27.932
One of my boys hurt?

13:28.474 --> 13:29.642
Yeah, they took him to Mercy.

13:30.392 --> 13:31.727
-How bad?
-He's pretty bad.

13:31.811 --> 13:33.729
Shaughnessy, we got
a crime scene here, all right?

13:33.813 --> 13:35.272
Let us do our job.

13:35.356 --> 13:38.400
This is why you got free food.
(indistinct)

13:38.484 --> 13:39.902
So I'm beaten half to death, huh?

13:39.985 --> 13:41.445
Hey, mister, you're gonna puncture a lung!

13:41.529 --> 13:43.113
Don't you take that emblem down!

13:43.364 --> 13:46.200
I swear to God, if I could
sell this place for 1,000 dollars--

13:46.283 --> 13:47.743
-(shouting)
-Don't you take that emblem down!

13:47.827 --> 13:49.203
-Easy! Easy! Easy!
-(shouting)

13:49.286 --> 13:51.372
Take a walk! You take a walk!

13:51.455 --> 13:54.542
Oh, this is still Shamrock turf!
People are gonna find that out!

14:04.051 --> 14:05.803
I'm gonna have to ask her
to loan me the money.

14:06.095 --> 14:06.971
Who? Lynn?

14:07.638 --> 14:09.390
-Yeah.
-Oh, Lord.

14:10.140 --> 14:14.770
(sighs) I'm payin' the IRS
175 bucks a week, Renko.

14:14.854 --> 14:16.647
Overtime was the only way
I was makin' the nut.

14:17.022 --> 14:20.150
I would like to take that chubby<i> caballero</i>

14:20.234 --> 14:23.529
and squish his bald head like a grape.

14:23.612 --> 14:25.197
(chuckles) Yeah, I would, too.

14:26.740 --> 14:28.284
You see this black van?

14:29.034 --> 14:30.536
Describin' the gang van,

14:30.619 --> 14:32.037
the beating this morning
at that grocery right here.

14:32.121 --> 14:36.125
...6-9, partial match to the plates.

14:37.126 --> 14:38.043
All right, let's hit it.

14:38.961 --> 14:39.795
Hold on.

14:39.879 --> 14:41.463
Unit 2202, backups--

14:41.547 --> 14:43.382
(tires squealing)

14:43.465 --> 14:48.137
(siren wailing)

15:05.279 --> 15:07.406
All right, get out! Stand up, all of ya!

15:07.489 --> 15:08.490
Get out of the van!

15:09.158 --> 15:10.951
-Stand up!
-Hands up in the air!

15:11.035 --> 15:12.077
Get your hands up over your head!

15:12.161 --> 15:14.872
You drivin' this thing?
I said, you drivin' this thing?

15:14.955 --> 15:17.082
-Huh? You drivin' this thing?
-All right, Renko, let him go!

15:17.166 --> 15:18.709
Who taught you to drive like that, man?

15:18.792 --> 15:19.960
Get your hands up against that van, man!

15:20.044 --> 15:21.503
Get 'em up against the van right now!

15:28.928 --> 15:30.638
Mrs. Fitzgerald, thanks for coming.

15:31.347 --> 15:32.514
Can we do this in a hurry, please?

15:32.598 --> 15:33.974
My husband doesn't know I'm here.

15:34.058 --> 15:36.185
As fast as we can,
as soon as they're told their rights.

15:36.268 --> 15:37.561
Right this way, Mrs. Fitzgerald.

15:37.645 --> 15:40.105
Hey, Mrs. Fitzgerald,
do you want some coffee or somethin'?

15:40.397 --> 15:41.231
Okay.

15:43.067 --> 15:45.694
(men talking, chuckling)

15:45.778 --> 15:46.946
We'll be waiting outside.

15:48.155 --> 15:49.823
Mm, yum-yum.

15:52.743 --> 15:55.913
The public defender's office
is sending over some more lawyers.

15:56.580 --> 15:59.124
If you're charged in the events
at the grocery store,

15:59.208 --> 16:00.834
each of you will be represented.

16:00.918 --> 16:02.795
Well, which events, Miss Lady?

16:02.878 --> 16:05.214
Talkin' about that Shamrock
that got wasted.

16:05.297 --> 16:06.840
-That's too bad.
-Right now,

16:06.924 --> 16:08.342
you're going to be in a lineup.

16:09.051 --> 16:10.511
Does each of you understand what that is?

16:11.345 --> 16:12.763
-Uhh.
-Mwah.

16:12.846 --> 16:15.975
Look at it. Look at it.
That button's hot. (laughs)

16:16.725 --> 16:19.395
I asked, do you understand
what's going to happen?

16:19.478 --> 16:22.022
Listen, why don't we get real, mama?

16:22.106 --> 16:24.108
Now, you know we want each other.

16:24.566 --> 16:27.528
-What are we wastin' time for?
-(laughter)

16:28.028 --> 16:30.280
Come on.
Hey, I think she's in love with me.

16:30.364 --> 16:32.366
-(laughter)
-They've been apprised.

16:33.492 --> 16:35.828
Well, if it isn't the three wise men.

16:35.911 --> 16:37.997
(laughter)

16:38.998 --> 16:40.124
We're ready, Mrs. Fitzgerald.

16:42.626 --> 16:43.711
What's going on?

16:43.794 --> 16:45.170
What the hell are you doing here, Dory?

16:45.254 --> 16:47.423
-They asked me to come down.
-Mr. Fitzgerald--

16:47.506 --> 16:49.049
-Who the hell do you think you are?
-Hey!

16:49.133 --> 16:51.010
Your wife came here of her own free will.

16:51.385 --> 16:53.679
You didn't see anything, Dory.
You were in the back.

16:54.013 --> 16:55.389
We didn't see.
We didn't see any of those people.

16:55.472 --> 16:56.932
She saw the license plates.

16:57.391 --> 16:59.560
She's-- She came out
after they got in their van.

16:59.643 --> 17:01.228
-Don--
-Don, nothin'!

17:01.520 --> 17:02.855
We're goin' home now.

17:03.147 --> 17:05.149
Uh, Mr. Fitzgerald... excuse me.

17:05.232 --> 17:06.942
I think you're making a big mistake here.

17:07.359 --> 17:10.237
The Shamrock boy died because of injuries
he received in your store.

17:10.320 --> 17:11.488
If you refuse to identify,

17:11.572 --> 17:13.240
you're just putting murderers
back out into the street.

17:14.074 --> 17:16.785
Well, what if we pick those bastards out?

17:17.703 --> 17:18.704
Well, I gotta live with 'em!

17:19.038 --> 17:20.581
They're taking over my neighborhood.

17:20.998 --> 17:22.624
How long before my store is burned?

17:22.708 --> 17:24.334
How long before they
come back and finish me?

17:24.668 --> 17:26.420
If you cooperate, I can promise you

17:26.503 --> 17:28.338
we'll use every resource
in this department to protect--

17:28.422 --> 17:29.798
Oh, every resource!

17:29.882 --> 17:31.467
Hey, mister, would that
be good enough for<i> you?</i>

17:34.178 --> 17:35.012
Yeah.

17:36.263 --> 17:37.264
Come on, Dory.

17:41.310 --> 17:42.519
What do we do with the Blood?

17:43.979 --> 17:45.981
Any stolen goods or contraband in the van?

17:47.816 --> 17:49.026
Well, check for warrants and kick 'em.

17:50.486 --> 17:53.822
Junior Brown couldn't make it.
He'll be at arraignment.

17:54.156 --> 17:55.491
I'm gonna do your intake
for you, all right?

17:55.574 --> 17:58.243
Look, I'm about to get sick.
You gotta get me out of here.

17:58.911 --> 18:00.788
You missed morning arraignment already.

18:00.871 --> 18:03.665
Carlina, best we can do is this afternoon.

18:04.083 --> 18:05.959
Hey, Harry, how's the law paper doin'?

18:06.043 --> 18:07.419
Great. Let me talk to her a minute.

18:09.338 --> 18:11.340
Your firm's representing Carla Walicki?

18:11.715 --> 18:13.759
Oh, she got into a little
trouble on the street.

18:13.842 --> 18:16.095
Her business manager keeps us on retainer.

18:16.929 --> 18:17.930
Her business manager?

18:18.222 --> 18:19.098
You mean her<i> pimp.</i>

18:20.849 --> 18:22.267
-Hi, Carla.
-Hi.

18:23.602 --> 18:25.979
Listen, Carla, suppose
I can get you in a program.

18:27.022 --> 18:29.483
Look, Detective, um, you think
you can get me something now?

18:29.817 --> 18:31.777
Look, I'd-I'd do you a favor back.

18:32.236 --> 18:34.196
Well, you learned a lot
in two months, didn't you, kid?

18:34.655 --> 18:36.115
Hey, look, I feel bad.

18:37.116 --> 18:38.951
Listen, I can't get you anything now,

18:39.034 --> 18:40.953
and I'm not lookin'
for any freebies, Carla.

18:41.787 --> 18:44.331
I'm askin' if I could get you
in a methadone program,

18:44.414 --> 18:45.582
will you try to get out of the life?

18:45.666 --> 18:47.459
-Yeah, yeah, I guess. Sure.
-Hey.

18:49.878 --> 18:52.381
-Okay, Darrow.
-Yeah, okay, Garibaldi.

18:53.048 --> 18:54.591
You know that you got
a chip on your shoulder

18:54.675 --> 18:56.093
bad as the monkey on her back?

18:57.553 --> 18:59.596
Sonny, I asked you nice twice,
now I'm tellin' ya,

18:59.680 --> 19:01.974
you got no business here,
you hit the street.

19:02.057 --> 19:04.351
-Take it easy, Uncle.
-Huh?

19:04.434 --> 19:06.645
-Kids today, huh, Sarge?
-(shouting)

19:06.728 --> 19:09.148
-Just move through.
-(indistinct)

19:09.231 --> 19:11.942
Hey, hey, mama!
I hate to have to leave you.

19:12.025 --> 19:14.862
(indistinct chattering)

19:14.945 --> 19:17.906
-Hey, Irish!
-(indistinct)

19:17.990 --> 19:19.867
Face, huh?! A face, huh?

19:19.950 --> 19:23.120
-Someone who wasted your buddy?
-Yeah, which monkey, man?!

19:23.203 --> 19:25.831
-Right here, man.
-(shouting)

19:35.299 --> 19:36.425
Come on, beat it!

19:36.508 --> 19:38.177
-Dead, man!
-Beat it!

19:38.427 --> 19:39.845
Get 'em out of here. Drive him home.

19:40.679 --> 19:41.513
You all right?

19:42.264 --> 19:45.058
I know it's me aging,
but I feel like they're getting worse.

19:45.350 --> 19:47.311
I heard an interesting theory
about that, Counselor.

19:47.394 --> 19:49.521
-They're getting worse.
-(chuckles)

19:49.938 --> 19:52.524
Yeah, we arrested her
on a prostitution charge.

19:52.608 --> 19:55.360
She's agreed to act as our informant
in a drug investigation.

19:56.236 --> 19:57.070
Right.

19:57.321 --> 19:59.656
Now, can we get that on a priority basis?

20:01.325 --> 20:04.036
Great. Thanks much. (sighs)

20:04.661 --> 20:06.663
When did we turn Carla Walicki?

20:07.164 --> 20:08.081
We didn't.

20:08.165 --> 20:10.125
I just heard you get her
on a methadone program

20:10.209 --> 20:11.251
as our informant.

20:11.335 --> 20:13.754
It's the only way we could
get her on priority, Pats.

20:14.713 --> 20:17.424
-But it's not true.
-Uh, hello.

20:17.507 --> 20:20.177
This is the "wake up and realize
what century we're in" contest.

20:20.510 --> 20:21.803
Is Patricia Mayo there?

20:21.887 --> 20:25.098
Harry, I know you're lookin'
to help this girl out,

20:25.182 --> 20:26.683
but you cut too many corners.

20:27.226 --> 20:29.019
I don't want to get jammed up
when it catches up with you.

20:29.102 --> 20:30.437
We're not gonna get jammed up, Pats.

20:30.520 --> 20:32.022
Meaning you don't<i> think </i>we will.

20:32.105 --> 20:33.899
And when we do,
then you'll try and get us out of it

20:33.982 --> 20:36.193
with you, with your
fancy footwork and charm.

20:36.568 --> 20:38.570
That's not how I want to operate.

20:38.654 --> 20:40.239
That's not the kind of cop I want to be.

20:41.782 --> 20:43.283
-Meaning what?
-Meaning I'm not sure.

20:43.367 --> 20:44.618
No, no, no.
Meaning you want a new partner?

20:44.701 --> 20:47.621
-I don't know, Harry!
-Oh, keep me posted, Pats.

20:49.081 --> 20:51.124
-Whew.
-(indistinct chatter)

20:51.583 --> 20:53.627
I don't expect them people
to get down on their hands

20:53.710 --> 20:55.587
and knees and say,
"Thank you very much, Andrew,

20:55.671 --> 20:57.381
for working your fingers
to the bone," but I expect

20:57.464 --> 20:59.967
some fair compensation for work that I do.

21:00.342 --> 21:01.426
Well, get another job then.

21:02.177 --> 21:04.888
Did I hear somebody say "job action," huh?

21:08.183 --> 21:09.351
I got the message, Mick.

21:11.103 --> 21:12.104
Thanks for comin'.

21:16.108 --> 21:17.776
-So?
-Oh...

21:18.694 --> 21:22.781
My mother... really wants us to come
to dinner Wednesday night.

21:25.075 --> 21:26.451
That was the emergency?

21:28.537 --> 21:29.830
Mick, you didn't tell her about us?

21:36.378 --> 21:37.212
Mick...

21:39.423 --> 21:40.757
What happened, Robin?

21:40.841 --> 21:44.011
We talked about it.
I thought you understood.

21:44.094 --> 21:45.178
No, no, I-I mean...

21:46.555 --> 21:48.473
you can't give me one more chance?

21:52.644 --> 21:53.729
I really love you.

21:55.230 --> 21:58.942
Look... this isn't easy
for me either, okay?

22:02.237 --> 22:04.239
(voice breaking)
Every time we see each other...

22:05.991 --> 22:07.409
it's like a knife.

22:12.831 --> 22:14.916
Tell your mother I'm sick or something.

22:15.000 --> 22:16.835
Tell her... I'm sorry.

22:18.837 --> 22:20.714
Or maybe just tell her the truth.

22:22.674 --> 22:23.675
Wait. Sit down.

22:23.967 --> 22:24.801
No!

22:28.430 --> 22:30.849
MAN:<i> We'll have variable winds</i>
<i>up to 30 miles an hour,</i>

22:30.932 --> 22:33.352
<i>with temperatures</i>
<i>in the early p.m. in the low 40s,</i>

22:33.435 --> 22:36.938
<i>dropping down to the low 30s</i>
<i>in the nighttime hours</i>

22:37.022 --> 22:39.274
<i>with probable snow flurries by midnight.</i>

22:39.608 --> 22:41.318
-Hi, sweetness.
-Can it!

22:42.152 --> 22:44.488
(lisping) I just love it
when he's stern like that.

22:44.571 --> 22:46.615
I told you, that's enough out of you!

22:46.698 --> 22:48.700
-(laughing)
-You understand?

22:49.368 --> 22:50.994
-Hey, Mick--
-You understand me?

22:51.078 --> 22:53.288
-(indistinct)
-Come on, man, he's just foolin' around.

22:53.372 --> 22:55.999
Lighten up, guys. Just-Just lighten up.

22:57.918 --> 22:59.711
I wish I'd known
this was in the wind, Fay.

23:02.005 --> 23:04.257
(siren wails)

23:05.092 --> 23:07.177
Well, you've been so busy,
Frank, and-and I didn't want

23:07.260 --> 23:08.804
to bother you with it
till I had all the facts.

23:08.887 --> 23:11.098
He's 9 years old, don't you
think that's a little young?

23:11.181 --> 23:14.184
Well, Dr. Auburn says
that the entire roof of Frank Jr's mouth

23:14.267 --> 23:16.895
has to be enlarged
so the teeth can come in properly.

23:17.354 --> 23:19.648
And starting early gives us
more options later on--

23:19.731 --> 23:22.484
you know, whether we want to straighten
the teeth or-or just use retainers.

23:22.567 --> 23:24.194
Sounds as if you have this
all figured out.

23:24.277 --> 23:25.404
Why bring me into it at all?

23:25.487 --> 23:28.782
Because Dr. Auburn doesn't do
charity work. He's funny that way.

23:28.865 --> 23:30.534
Well, at those prices,
I'd like a second opinion.

23:30.617 --> 23:32.327
That's easy for you to say, Frank.

23:32.702 --> 23:34.746
I mean, you don't have
to make the appointments.

23:34.830 --> 23:37.791
And you don't have to take off
from work to make sure he gets there.

23:37.874 --> 23:39.793
And you don't have to sit up
with him in the middle of the night

23:39.876 --> 23:42.421
when he's crying
because he's afraid it's gonna hurt.

23:42.504 --> 23:44.756
All I'm asking you to do is to give up

23:44.840 --> 23:47.968
some of that 6,000 dollar federal grant
you finagled for yourself.

23:48.051 --> 23:50.387
Look, Joyce and I are
setting aside that money

23:50.470 --> 23:51.638
toward the purchase of a house.

23:51.721 --> 23:53.432
I don't believe this!

23:53.723 --> 23:57.144
I'm talking about your son's health
and you're talking about real estate!

23:57.227 --> 24:00.772
No! What I'm talking about
is not having any say

24:00.856 --> 24:04.359
in a major decision that involves
my son's health and welfare!

24:04.443 --> 24:07.988
Excuse me. My name's Ted Rose.
I couldn't help overhearing.

24:08.071 --> 24:09.489
Well, you could if you had better manners.

24:09.573 --> 24:10.407
Fay.

24:11.491 --> 24:13.910
-I'm sorry.
-I happen to be an orthodontist.

24:13.994 --> 24:17.289
My ears perk up when I hear
about rapid palatal expansion.

24:17.914 --> 24:20.083
If you're so interested
in a second opinion,

24:20.750 --> 24:22.377
why don't you ask "Dr. Buttinsky" here?

24:25.130 --> 24:27.174
-Nobody likes the dentist.
-(door slams)

24:27.924 --> 24:29.718
It's the woman's third marriage.

24:29.801 --> 24:32.137
-She has children from...
-Hey, Leon!

24:32.220 --> 24:34.431
- ...previous involvements.
-MICK: A complicated situation.

24:35.223 --> 24:36.433
LEON: How many times
have I had to tell you--

24:36.516 --> 24:38.185
-RINCON: What?
-LEON: You don't come here...

24:38.268 --> 24:40.395
-(whispers) It's Rincon.
-RINCON: Oh, yeah, Leon.

24:40.479 --> 24:41.480
Well, do your shampoo.

24:41.563 --> 24:44.024
What's complicated? She's a spider.

24:44.483 --> 24:46.151
She snared my son in her web.

24:46.234 --> 24:49.362
-You don't owe me my money?
-Which I fully intend to pay.

24:49.446 --> 24:50.780
WOMAN: Am I wrong, Michael?

24:51.323 --> 24:53.450
Don't I have a mother's obligation
to save him?

24:53.533 --> 24:55.202
Shut up a second, Mrs. Weems.

24:55.744 --> 24:57.746
-Where's your stash, Kenny?
-What?

24:57.829 --> 24:59.581
-The dope, where do you keep it?
-Why do you wanna know that?

24:59.664 --> 25:01.416
Because if I need to move,
I gotta protect you.

25:01.500 --> 25:02.959
Oh, God. It's under the table.

25:03.043 --> 25:05.128
- ...now!
-Get out of this salon!

25:05.504 --> 25:08.632
Drop that! Police! Both of you, freeze!

25:08.715 --> 25:09.758
-What?
-Drop it.

25:09.841 --> 25:12.010
What-- What, what, what police?

25:12.511 --> 25:13.428
You're all busted.

25:13.845 --> 25:16.056
Come on, this isn't really necessary,
all right?

25:16.139 --> 25:18.058
Hey, things got a little
out of hand. We're buddies.

25:18.141 --> 25:19.184
Shut up.

25:20.101 --> 25:22.604
Assault, sale and possession
with intent...

25:24.898 --> 25:26.191
and possession for you.

25:27.234 --> 25:28.360
What, you think I really liked you?

25:28.443 --> 25:30.362
You were just a way
into this joint, you jerk.

25:30.445 --> 25:32.531
That's what I get
for dealing with<i> mericons.</i>

25:33.114 --> 25:34.783
Kenny, Kenny.

25:35.617 --> 25:37.619
Such poor judgment in friends.

25:37.702 --> 25:38.620
Ambulance!

25:38.703 --> 25:41.581
(sirens wailing)

25:43.083 --> 25:45.043
-Hey, man!
-All right.

25:46.253 --> 25:47.337
Just hold it right there!

25:47.420 --> 25:49.589
-(shouting)
-MAN: Now get out of here!

25:50.298 --> 25:52.217
What happened here? What happened?

25:52.300 --> 25:54.135
(shouting)

25:55.595 --> 25:57.514
-Get out of here, man!
-(indistinct)

25:57.597 --> 25:59.849
This is not your fight!
Just get out of here!

25:59.933 --> 26:01.476
Did anybody see anything?

26:01.560 --> 26:04.187
No! Nobody saw nothin' here!

26:04.563 --> 26:05.605
Nobody!

26:05.689 --> 26:07.774
We need two more ambulances,
Dekker and 119!

26:08.149 --> 26:11.736
-(sobs) Shamrock is dead, man.
-LUCY: Go on! Move back!

26:11.820 --> 26:13.530
-Everybody move back!
-Shamrock is dead!

26:13.613 --> 26:15.031
I'm tellin' you, man.

26:15.490 --> 26:18.118
I'm gonna shut this down
once and for all, you hear me?

26:18.535 --> 26:19.869
(indistinct chatter)

26:19.953 --> 26:21.621
Stand back. Move back!

26:28.920 --> 26:30.213
MAN: Turn to your left.

26:30.880 --> 26:32.549
You recognize any of these men?

26:33.049 --> 26:36.011
Ain't nobody gonna recognize 'em
in another six hours from now.

26:37.596 --> 26:39.848
-What did you say, Bumpus?
-MAN: Turn back to center.

26:39.931 --> 26:41.891
Hey, man, look,
I told you what I told you--

26:42.142 --> 26:44.561
I don't see who did it. Are we through?

26:45.395 --> 26:48.648
No identification, Captain?
Is Mr. Shaughnessy released?

26:49.482 --> 26:50.317
Yeah.

26:51.151 --> 26:53.820
You tell Mr. Shaughnessy
he's gettin' company soon...

26:54.362 --> 26:55.196
real soon.

26:55.488 --> 26:57.949
-Get your hand off of me.
-Drive him wherever he's going.

26:58.783 --> 26:59.618
Come on.

27:01.369 --> 27:03.538
As soon as they clear the building,
release Shaughnessy.

27:03.913 --> 27:04.831
-All right.
-(door closes)

27:05.332 --> 27:06.291
HENRY: That's it.

27:08.335 --> 27:09.586
This blows tonight.

27:10.253 --> 27:12.464
I have a call in to Daniels to see
if we can up the manpower.

27:12.547 --> 27:13.590
LEO: Stay in file.

27:13.965 --> 27:16.176
Bus is outside
through the door to your left.

27:16.259 --> 27:17.093
Move.

27:17.552 --> 27:19.095
Move, Tinkerbell!

27:19.179 --> 27:21.056
Hey, Mick, could I see you for a minute?

27:23.475 --> 27:24.309
Hey, Carla.

27:24.976 --> 27:26.561
Carla, listen,
you're all right with the program.

27:26.645 --> 27:28.146
-Hey, thanks, okay?
-Okay.

27:37.572 --> 27:38.573
(clears throat)

27:39.115 --> 27:41.284
An iffy assault on Rincon

27:41.826 --> 27:44.746
and small-scale possession charges
against his distributor

27:44.829 --> 27:47.832
aren't quite what we were hoping
for from this undercover, Mick.

27:47.916 --> 27:50.543
I judged there were civilians at risk,

27:50.627 --> 27:52.379
and I felt that I ought to move.

27:52.462 --> 27:54.005
I've seen you diffuse too many situations

27:54.089 --> 27:55.882
to believe you couldn't
have cooled this one down

27:55.965 --> 27:56.966
without blowing your cover.

27:57.425 --> 27:58.843
Is our informant at risk?

27:59.636 --> 28:01.763
I can lean on him a little more
in front of the others,

28:01.846 --> 28:04.099
but I think if he wants relocation,
we gotta support him.

28:04.474 --> 28:05.433
I'm not sure I can get the money.

28:06.309 --> 28:07.769
Oh, that's great.

28:07.852 --> 28:09.646
We didn't get much of a bust here, Mick!

28:13.733 --> 28:16.152
There aren't too many secrets
around a station house, you know.

28:17.070 --> 28:19.447
Uh, I hear you and Robin have split up.

28:20.990 --> 28:22.701
Oh, I don't think that's any
of your business.

28:22.951 --> 28:24.536
It is when it interferes
with your doing your job.

28:24.994 --> 28:28.540
Everyone has an off day.
I had an off day today.

28:32.877 --> 28:33.962
I gotta go to court.

28:41.344 --> 28:42.554
What's up, Lieutenant?

28:42.929 --> 28:45.014
Is that girl outside the "informant"

28:45.098 --> 28:47.308
you got into the side
in the methadone program?

28:48.435 --> 28:49.352
Uh, Carla, right.

28:49.894 --> 28:50.937
Who'd you talk to about turning her?

28:51.813 --> 28:53.606
Well, actually, no one yet, Lieutenant.
What do you think?

28:54.023 --> 28:55.775
I think she's a lousy candidate
for a snitch.

28:55.859 --> 28:56.735
That's a different conversation.

28:57.193 --> 28:59.112
You made an unauthorized request
to that agency,

28:59.195 --> 29:00.655
and you misrepresented the girl's status.

29:00.739 --> 29:02.449
Well, Lieutenant, she's a kid.
She needed a break.

29:02.824 --> 29:04.868
-In exchange for what?
-Hey, you're out of line.

29:04.951 --> 29:07.412
That's what it looks like.
That's what you leave yourself open for.

29:07.495 --> 29:09.581
Oh, well, that's great. What, you show a
little concern for a kid,

29:09.664 --> 29:11.291
and all of a sudden
you're a moral suspect?

29:11.708 --> 29:14.502
I've had that knock on my door,
2 o'clock in the morning--

29:15.044 --> 29:16.588
She's cold, she's hungry.

29:16.671 --> 29:18.673
Sit there and watch her eat
a box of Girl Scout cookies.

29:19.132 --> 29:21.176
She looks up at you with milk mustache.

29:21.259 --> 29:22.469
She just wants to curl up
against your shoulder--

29:22.552 --> 29:24.804
Maybe that's your problem,
Lieutenant. It's not mine!

29:26.556 --> 29:28.850
Now, I'm sorry.
I'm gettin' a lot of free advice today.

29:28.933 --> 29:30.769
This isn't advice, Harry.
It's information.

29:30.852 --> 29:32.896
I've canceled your request
on Carla Walicki.

29:34.063 --> 29:34.981
Fine. Anything else?

29:35.732 --> 29:36.941
I just think you ought to cool your jets.

29:38.860 --> 29:39.861
(crash)

29:41.321 --> 29:43.114
Judas, Joseph, and Murphy!

29:43.198 --> 29:44.073
You all right, Howard?

29:46.242 --> 29:47.786
-(sighs)
-What happened here?

29:47.869 --> 29:48.912
Sergeant Jablonski,

29:48.995 --> 29:51.456
you have turned this lavatory
into a deathtrap.

29:51.790 --> 29:56.795
(indistinct chatter)

30:01.090 --> 30:01.925
(exhales)

30:05.053 --> 30:06.554
Excuse me, Mrs. Furillo?

30:06.638 --> 30:07.472
Yes?

30:08.306 --> 30:09.599
Uh, Ted Rose.

30:13.436 --> 30:15.480
Giannini's Restaurant this afternoon.

30:15.563 --> 30:18.149
(gasps) Oh, dear.

30:19.275 --> 30:21.903
Oh, I'm-I'm sorry, Dr. Rose.

30:22.403 --> 30:26.157
You must think-- Well, you know,
it's just that when my ex-husband and I

30:26.241 --> 30:28.743
talk about expenses,
things get pretty tense.

30:28.827 --> 30:30.245
-I know how it gets.
-MAN: Excuse me, folks.

30:30.578 --> 30:33.164
Our children's orthodontia seems
to be about the only thing

30:33.248 --> 30:34.749
that my ex-wife and I agree on.

30:35.250 --> 30:36.709
That's because they get it for free.

30:36.793 --> 30:38.503
WOMAN: Excuse me, gotta get in here.

30:38.586 --> 30:39.921
I'm so embarrassed.

30:40.004 --> 30:42.090
I took the liberty of chatting
with your ex-husband

30:42.173 --> 30:43.466
about your son's teeth.

30:43.550 --> 30:46.344
Seems to me his orthodontist
has a very sensible plan.

30:46.427 --> 30:47.470
Well, do you know Dr. Auburn?

30:48.304 --> 30:49.639
Just by reputation.

30:50.390 --> 30:52.475
My only thought, for what it's worth,

30:52.559 --> 30:53.893
there are intermediate steps.

30:54.394 --> 30:56.896
The most essential part
is to expand the hard palate

30:56.980 --> 30:58.022
to accommodate the teeth.

30:58.106 --> 31:00.149
Less important is the cosmetics.

31:00.233 --> 31:02.485
Oh, well, but don't
underestimate the cosmetics.

31:02.569 --> 31:04.988
I've always been pretty sensitive
about my overbite.

31:06.030 --> 31:07.782
Gee, I've always been
a sucker for an overbite.

31:09.367 --> 31:11.160
Which brings me
to the purpose of my visit.

31:11.786 --> 31:12.829
Yes?

31:14.163 --> 31:15.248
To ask you to dinner.

31:16.332 --> 31:18.001
A second opinion never hurts.

31:23.172 --> 31:25.216
Case notes
on a prior disorderly conviction

31:25.300 --> 31:27.385
show Miss Walicki
was moving to California.

31:28.094 --> 31:29.220
She was, Your Honor.

31:29.304 --> 31:31.848
Did you, uh, go and come back?

31:32.307 --> 31:33.558
I never went, Your Honor.

31:33.892 --> 31:35.476
Your Honor,
there's a question in this case

31:35.560 --> 31:37.687
as to my client's actual age.

31:37.770 --> 31:39.772
No, please! Look, my father will get me!

31:39.856 --> 31:41.274
That detective took care of it.

31:42.483 --> 31:43.318
What's the question?

31:44.694 --> 31:47.405
Uh, none, Your Honor. I was misinformed.

31:47.697 --> 31:50.742
You were evidently told the court
would not be so forgiving

31:50.825 --> 31:52.660
on a second offense, Miss Walicki.

31:54.203 --> 31:55.580
You're charged with solicitation.

31:55.663 --> 31:56.539
How do you plead?

31:56.623 --> 31:58.458
(sighs) Guilty, Your Honor.

32:00.293 --> 32:01.127
Sixty days.

32:01.836 --> 32:03.630
Hey, what about the methadone program?

32:04.380 --> 32:05.673
No such indication in the file.

32:06.549 --> 32:07.383
(gavel bangs)

32:07.800 --> 32:08.927
Next case.

32:11.179 --> 32:13.973
MAN: Docket numbers 53072
through 4, Your Honor,

32:14.057 --> 32:16.184
-Your Honor.
-Leon Degaulle, Kenneth Sterling--

32:16.267 --> 32:18.478
Possession of heroin
with intent to distribute.

32:19.187 --> 32:23.107
Sir, is there any chance of waiving
the, uh, time on Carla Walicki?

32:23.191 --> 32:24.943
See, I-I sort of made her a promise

32:25.026 --> 32:26.819
that I'd get her into a program,
and it fell through.

32:27.362 --> 32:29.280
You'd like to keep your word, Detective?

32:30.114 --> 32:34.118
And I intend to keep mine
to my colleagues. Sorry.

32:35.203 --> 32:37.163
Counsel and complainant approach.

32:39.290 --> 32:40.124
(quietly) Damn!

32:47.131 --> 32:48.675
I have been through these papers.

32:49.342 --> 32:50.927
The drug charges are a hash, Your Honor.

32:51.344 --> 32:52.303
No pun intended.

32:54.305 --> 32:57.558
The question of ownership
is a little obscure, Mr. D.A.

32:57.809 --> 32:59.686
We maintain the drugs were owned jointly

32:59.769 --> 33:01.688
by Mr. Degaulle
and Mr. Sterling, Your Honor.

33:02.146 --> 33:05.191
Six nickel bags seized in an area
of common access, Your Honor.

33:05.274 --> 33:07.151
How can any ownership be ascribed?

33:07.777 --> 33:11.572
(sighs) Well, I'm gonna dismiss
on the drugs.

33:12.448 --> 33:14.951
Leaves us with assault against Mr. Rincon.

33:15.576 --> 33:17.954
This was a mild disagreement
between friends, Your Honor.

33:18.037 --> 33:21.165
This was a razor attack,
and we have other witnesses

33:21.249 --> 33:22.667
besides the complainant,
Belker, Your Honor.

33:23.710 --> 33:25.837
Assault charges stand. Step back, please.

33:26.796 --> 33:27.630
JUDGE: Detective?

33:29.799 --> 33:31.342
I've seen you do better police work.

33:36.764 --> 33:39.892
On the drug charges against
misters Degaulle and Sterling,

33:40.893 --> 33:41.769
dismissed.

33:43.021 --> 33:45.356
How do you plead
to the assault, Mr. Rincon?

33:45.440 --> 33:47.316
That was just a misunderstanding, Judge.

33:47.942 --> 33:50.611
-Are you Mr. Rincon?
-No, I'm-I'm the alleged victim.

33:50.695 --> 33:52.321
But it was just a big misunderstanding.

33:52.405 --> 33:54.699
Yeah, right, I'm not guilty.
Are you kiddin', Your Honor?

33:55.116 --> 33:57.744
Ten thousand dollars bail,
ten percent cash alternative.

33:57.827 --> 33:59.245
-Set a short date.
-(gavel bangs)

34:02.665 --> 34:04.542
Yo... Garibaldi.

34:04.917 --> 34:05.752
What?

34:05.835 --> 34:07.003
Delivery for you.

34:07.920 --> 34:08.755
What's this?

34:09.005 --> 34:10.590
Second row, last seat...

34:10.965 --> 34:13.676
<i>Marbury v. Madison</i>
and the Separation of Power.

34:15.720 --> 34:18.848
This way, I don't make the pass
inside the hallowed walls.

34:18.931 --> 34:19.849
(sighs)

34:20.183 --> 34:23.352
Boy, I should have known
you'd have somethin' to do with this.

34:23.436 --> 34:25.188
Listen, I'm just the postman.

34:25.271 --> 34:28.149
But it's C.O.D.-- 80 bucks.

34:28.232 --> 34:29.067
(sighs)

34:31.861 --> 34:34.155
So, uh, did you write yours?

34:34.906 --> 34:36.282
Yeah, I found the time.

34:37.241 --> 34:41.871
You know, you got a lot of attitude
for someone who buys his papers.

34:42.288 --> 34:43.206
See you in class.

34:44.999 --> 34:47.293
Maybe you walked this time, Kenny,

34:47.376 --> 34:49.629
but I'm gonna be on you
and your friend's case

34:49.712 --> 34:51.589
every move you make,
and I'm gonna get you.

34:51.839 --> 34:53.174
-You scared?
-Yes.

34:53.257 --> 34:54.425
Good! You oughta be!

34:54.509 --> 34:57.678
Hey, Mick, take it easy.
You lost one. Let it go.

34:58.304 --> 34:59.430
You understand me?

34:59.514 --> 35:00.348
I understand.

35:04.143 --> 35:04.977
Think it sold?

35:05.728 --> 35:07.146
"D" plus, "C" minus.

35:14.904 --> 35:16.906
-Gentlemen.
-Thanks for coming, Chief.

35:17.323 --> 35:19.826
Always prompt when I hear
the sky is falling, Frank.

35:22.662 --> 35:23.496
(clears throat)

35:23.788 --> 35:26.165
We're 95 percent certain
there's gonna be a pitched battle

35:26.249 --> 35:28.084
between the Blood
and the Shamrock tonight.

35:28.167 --> 35:29.210
Do we have a place?

35:29.293 --> 35:31.170
The only area the Shamrocks still control

35:31.254 --> 35:33.840
is the immediate vicinity
of their headquarters.

35:34.257 --> 35:37.301
I'd expect a drive-by
by the Bloods to draw them out.

35:37.385 --> 35:39.011
The fight could take place
anywhere in that vicinity.

35:39.095 --> 35:41.472
Then that's certainly
where I would focus my patrols.

35:41.556 --> 35:44.100
We were hoping you'd authorize
additional manpower.

35:44.183 --> 35:45.351
Not on speculation, Frank,

35:45.434 --> 35:48.020
not when the ink isn't dry
on the directive cutting overtime.

35:48.104 --> 35:50.857
Then, in other words, we're giving
our blessing to a last man standing.

35:51.482 --> 35:54.318
Frank, these thugs have been
at each other's throats

35:54.402 --> 35:55.444
for three months.

35:56.445 --> 35:58.656
I don't have to quote you the number
of civilian casualties.

35:58.739 --> 36:00.700
Everything I get from gang intervention

36:00.783 --> 36:03.995
says this Shaughnessy
is determined to go down in flames.

36:04.495 --> 36:07.415
Why devote men and resources
to postponing the inevitable?

36:07.498 --> 36:09.792
What's inevitable
is the Blood taking over that turf.

36:09.876 --> 36:11.210
The streets don't have to run red.

36:11.294 --> 36:13.713
Fine. Then make some arrests.

36:13.796 --> 36:16.465
You've had God knows how many
crimes committed on both sides.

36:16.883 --> 36:19.177
My understanding
is you can't get identifications.

36:22.513 --> 36:24.348
I gotta go catch hell at a P.B.A. meeting.

36:25.516 --> 36:27.393
If the fight actually goes down,

36:27.476 --> 36:29.520
you call in all
the off-duty people you need.

36:29.937 --> 36:32.106
Otherwise,
keep your assigned patrols on alert.

36:32.523 --> 36:34.317
Prepare to respond
as circumstances warrant.

36:35.985 --> 36:39.322
I endorse survival of the fittest,
and I'm an unfeeling brute.

36:39.405 --> 36:42.742
Darwin does. He's an evolutionary genius.

36:42.825 --> 36:43.659
(scoffs)

36:47.079 --> 36:48.206
Ask the men, Henry.

36:48.956 --> 36:49.790
Yeah.

36:52.960 --> 36:53.794
(door closes)

36:54.462 --> 36:56.297
I don't know what he wanted.
He just showed up.

36:58.925 --> 37:00.718
(sobbing)

37:08.267 --> 37:10.937
(Kenny sobbing)

37:17.526 --> 37:18.569
What's the matter, Kenny?

37:19.820 --> 37:20.863
(voice breaking) It didn't work, Michael.

37:21.948 --> 37:23.199
They know about me. I'm sure of it.

37:23.282 --> 37:24.784
Well, how? What happened?

37:25.326 --> 37:27.411
Well, w-when I got home,
the phone was ringing,

37:27.495 --> 37:29.538
and I answered it,
and there was nobody there.

37:30.456 --> 37:32.583
-And cars were passing by outside.
-Okay.

37:32.667 --> 37:34.210
-They'd stop, they'd go on.
-It's okay.

37:34.293 --> 37:35.753
I-I heard somebody comin' up the stairs.

37:35.836 --> 37:36.963
I-I climbed down the fire escape.

37:37.046 --> 37:39.340
All right now, you gotta calm down.

37:41.926 --> 37:43.678
They're gonna kill me, Michael. I know it.

37:50.184 --> 37:51.227
Come on.

37:51.686 --> 37:53.020
Where-- Where are we-- Where are we goin'?

37:54.355 --> 37:55.314
Come on.

38:00.528 --> 38:02.071
Yeah. No, I know, I know.

38:02.947 --> 38:04.282
Okay, well, just keep trying.

38:04.573 --> 38:05.783
Okay, thank you very much.

38:06.200 --> 38:07.410
Frank, have you got a moment?

38:07.743 --> 38:08.577
Sure.

38:08.911 --> 38:12.581
I just wanted to say that I'm sorry
about what happened today at lunch.

38:13.082 --> 38:14.041
Well, I am too.

38:14.792 --> 38:16.002
We'll just do what we have to do.

38:17.295 --> 38:18.879
You know, that Dr. Rose stopped by.

38:18.963 --> 38:21.173
-He said he talked to you.
-He's a nice fellow.

38:21.799 --> 38:22.758
He asked me to dinner.

38:23.926 --> 38:24.760
That so?

38:25.720 --> 38:28.264
You didn't promote that invitation
by any chance, did you?

38:29.390 --> 38:30.266
Why would I do that?

38:31.309 --> 38:32.643
Maybe in the dim hope

38:32.727 --> 38:35.062
of getting some wholesale dentistry
for Frank Jr.?

38:35.521 --> 38:36.522
Fay...

38:37.231 --> 38:40.192
Well, anyhow, I said yes,
but only because he likes my overbite.

38:40.276 --> 38:41.319
He has good taste.

38:44.989 --> 38:47.908
(indistinct conversations)

38:47.992 --> 38:49.327
-BELKO: That's right.
-Fellas!

38:49.410 --> 38:50.578
-They should admit that.
-Guys?

38:52.246 --> 38:53.539
Who wants to make a try at cooling out

38:53.622 --> 38:56.083
this Shamrock-Blood thing
for absolutely no pay?

38:57.710 --> 38:59.253
-BOBBY: No pay?
-BELKO: No, sir.

38:59.337 --> 39:00.629
No, sir. Thank you very much.

39:00.713 --> 39:01.881
No problem, Andy.

39:01.964 --> 39:03.591
-Hey, we got a plan?
-Yep.

39:03.966 --> 39:06.302
You know, I mean,
are we gonna accomplish somethin'?

39:06.385 --> 39:08.679
We're gonna try,
minimum, we get through the night.

39:10.181 --> 39:12.433
(exhales) One night,
that's all they get from me.

39:12.516 --> 39:13.726
That's all I'm askin' you for.

39:13.809 --> 39:14.852
We get dinner first, Lieutenant?

39:14.935 --> 39:17.563
-(snickering)
-Eight o'clock, Hurdle overpass.

39:19.231 --> 39:20.066
Wow.

39:21.442 --> 39:22.276
What's up, men?

39:26.447 --> 39:28.532
You sure the department's
gonna pay you back?

39:30.284 --> 39:32.620
Relocation money
just hasn't come through yet.

39:34.622 --> 39:35.456
Kenny...

39:36.207 --> 39:38.000
Stop lookin' over your shoulder.

39:38.542 --> 39:39.794
I'll tell you the truth--

39:39.877 --> 39:42.922
I don't think you were made to begin with,
and this guy Rincon

39:43.005 --> 39:44.965
has never been out
of the city in his life.

39:47.968 --> 39:49.970
I'm very, uh... grateful.

39:50.221 --> 39:52.139
Well, I'm sorry you were
put in the position.

39:52.807 --> 39:54.975
I'm more a warm-weather creature anyway.

39:57.520 --> 39:59.730
-All right...
-WOMAN:<i> Last call for bus number...</i>

39:59.814 --> 40:02.233
That's my Aunt Ida's address
if you should need a hot meal.

40:02.316 --> 40:04.652
<i>-...St. Petersburg and Miami.</i>
-She'll talk your ear off.

40:05.403 --> 40:07.029
I'm in the hair business, Michael.

40:08.030 --> 40:09.031
(horn honks)

40:09.115 --> 40:11.283
MAN: Come on, fella,
we're movin', pullin' out.

40:15.204 --> 40:17.206
-WOMAN:<i> Bus number 42 for...</i>
-Take care of yourself.

40:17.289 --> 40:18.749
<i>...two hours late due to poor weather.</i>

40:18.833 --> 40:20.876
-Okay.
<i>-Sorry for the delay.</i>

40:27.383 --> 40:29.760
I'll try to get these back
by a week from Friday

40:29.844 --> 40:31.095
if my eyes hold out.

40:33.722 --> 40:34.723
Hey...

40:35.599 --> 40:37.393
That was a good question
you asked in class.

40:38.436 --> 40:39.478
Thanks, Harry.

40:49.738 --> 40:50.906
Excuse me, sir.

40:51.657 --> 40:52.616
Yes, Mr. Garibaldi?

40:53.701 --> 40:55.536
Is there any chance
of my getting an extension?

40:56.078 --> 40:57.913
Now, you knew about this
deadline two months ago.

40:57.997 --> 41:01.125
I know. It's just that I'm a cop,
and we got really jammed up--

41:01.208 --> 41:02.710
This is a night school, Mr. Garibaldi.

41:02.793 --> 41:04.670
I'd venture every person
here has a day job.

41:05.045 --> 41:07.173
Your job doesn't entitle you
to special pleading.

41:08.466 --> 41:10.217
No. How about just, like,
regular pleading?

41:11.719 --> 41:13.762
There comes a point
when the world stops honoring

41:13.846 --> 41:15.806
youth and possibility, Mr. Garibaldi.

41:16.265 --> 41:18.058
It stops honoring boyish grins.

41:19.185 --> 41:20.853
I'll give you three days
to deliver your paper.

41:21.687 --> 41:23.772
Okay, three days will do it, sir.
I'm almost done.

41:31.030 --> 41:33.157
-Police! Everybody down!
-On the floor now! Now!

41:33.240 --> 41:34.992
-MAN: Hey! We didn't do anything!
-MAN 2: What is this?

41:35.075 --> 41:36.577
This is odd. Wait a minute.

41:36.660 --> 41:37.828
Down, Shaughnessy.

41:37.912 --> 41:38.871
MAN 3: Oh, man!

41:44.835 --> 41:45.711
I don't believe this.

41:50.299 --> 41:51.133
We didn't do anything.

41:52.885 --> 41:53.719
Headquarters secured.

41:54.803 --> 41:56.347
Copy, Henry. Stand by.

42:15.324 --> 42:18.035
Dispatch, this is Captain Furillo.

42:18.369 --> 42:20.371
Dispatch units to Dekker and 119th.

42:27.503 --> 42:28.587
(brakes squeak)

42:32.883 --> 42:35.844
-Let's go.
-(indistinct)

42:37.346 --> 42:38.472
Let's do it.

42:40.516 --> 42:41.517
(indistinct)

42:43.143 --> 42:44.228
Hey, what's that?

42:45.813 --> 42:47.648
All Bloods, freeze! Police!

42:47.731 --> 42:48.816
-Stop right there!
-Freeze!

42:48.899 --> 42:51.110
-Back away!
-Party's over, boys!

42:51.193 --> 42:52.236
Drop your weapons!

42:52.319 --> 42:54.697
(indistinct shouting)

42:57.866 --> 43:00.494
Weapons on the ground, Bumpus, now!

43:00.578 --> 43:03.330
-(siren wails)
-(clattering)

43:03.414 --> 43:05.457
-MAN: You heard the man! Move!
-FURILLO: Hands on the car!

43:05.541 --> 43:08.877
-BLOOD: He's always crazy, babe!
-BOBBY: Okay, let's move. Move.

43:08.961 --> 43:12.089
-MAN: Put your hands on the car!
-(sirens wailing)

43:12.172 --> 43:14.133
BLOOD: Don't push, man! That hurts!

43:14.216 --> 43:16.302
(indistinct)

43:19.847 --> 43:22.224
Up against the car! Spread your legs!

43:23.225 --> 43:24.643
(siren stops)

43:24.727 --> 43:25.936
MAN: Hey, keep your hands up.

43:26.604 --> 43:28.606
BLOOD: Just don't point that thing.

43:28.689 --> 43:31.025
-Come on, hit the cars.
-Hey, don't push me, man!

43:38.782 --> 43:39.617
All right, get in.

43:43.537 --> 43:44.622
We gonna neck now?

43:45.873 --> 43:49.168
No. You're gonna shut up,
and I'm gonna make you a proposal.

43:49.627 --> 43:51.003
What kind of proposal?

43:53.380 --> 43:56.550
You I.D. the Shamrocks
who did the drive-by murder this morning,

43:57.092 --> 43:59.053
or you and the other Blood
buy a couple of months

43:59.136 --> 44:00.971
for the weapons you brought
to the dance tonight.

44:02.222 --> 44:03.724
So, what's a couple of months, huh?

44:04.350 --> 44:05.684
This turf is comin' our way,

44:05.768 --> 44:07.686
and there's nothin'
you can do to stop that.

44:08.270 --> 44:09.938
We both know the Shamrocks' time is over.

44:11.273 --> 44:13.233
You I.D. them now, you don't go away.

44:14.652 --> 44:17.529
Their turf's yours by default,
no war, no bloodshed.

44:19.948 --> 44:22.868
-What's in it for you?
-No war, no bloodshed.

44:23.327 --> 44:24.953
SHAMROCK: Hey, what about the Blood, huh?

44:25.746 --> 44:27.081
The Blood don't got busted!

44:27.164 --> 44:28.040
MAN: Put him in the car.

44:28.123 --> 44:30.000
What the hell is goin' on here?

44:38.759 --> 44:39.593
Tell 'em, Bumpus.

44:45.724 --> 44:47.101
All Blood, drop your meat.

44:48.477 --> 44:49.520
Walk away.

44:50.270 --> 44:52.481
Shine in 20 minutes at Mom's and Lucky's.

44:53.399 --> 44:54.233
Now!

44:58.320 --> 45:00.906
(indistinct chattering)

45:03.325 --> 45:05.327
BLOOD: Don't get no satisfaction here.

45:05.411 --> 45:06.704
The men have their meter running.

45:07.746 --> 45:08.997
What do you say we call it a night?

45:16.171 --> 45:19.466
Shine in the Kubiak in 20 minutes.

45:19.550 --> 45:20.759
(chuckles)

45:20.843 --> 45:21.677
Now!

45:36.400 --> 45:37.568
Hey!

45:49.204 --> 45:50.581
(siren wailing)

45:52.750 --> 45:55.043
-What are you doin', Mick?
-What are you doin'?

45:56.503 --> 45:57.379
I was out on a date.

45:58.255 --> 46:01.175
So what was all that crap
about you're closed off,

46:01.258 --> 46:02.801
you'll never change?

46:03.218 --> 46:05.179
You just wanted to go out
with another guy?

46:06.555 --> 46:07.765
-Right.
-Right?

46:08.474 --> 46:10.017
How long you been goin' out with him?

46:10.350 --> 46:11.602
However long you want to think.

46:11.685 --> 46:12.686
How long?

46:15.230 --> 46:16.064
Not very.

46:19.693 --> 46:20.569
Is he a cop?

46:25.574 --> 46:26.575
Mick, it wasn't him.

46:29.828 --> 46:31.288
We just weren't gonna make it.

46:33.123 --> 46:34.124
(voice breaking) Please?

46:35.542 --> 46:37.044
I<i> can </i>change.

46:37.461 --> 46:38.712
Don't do this to yourself.

46:40.047 --> 46:41.381
Don't do this to both of us.

46:48.055 --> 46:48.931
Okay.

46:51.558 --> 46:53.393
I-I won't bother you anymore.

46:59.900 --> 47:00.734
Good night.

47:02.945 --> 47:04.154
Good night.

47:05.614 --> 47:06.657
I'm sorry.

47:09.827 --> 47:11.912
I hope you find happiness.

47:14.498 --> 47:15.499
I hope you do, too.

47:35.686 --> 47:37.813
(siren wails)

47:47.281 --> 47:50.117
(closing theme playing)
