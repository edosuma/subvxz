00:32.266 --> 00:34.735
Hey, get out.
We have to go check.

00:51.119 --> 00:52.553
Damn.

00:52.653 --> 00:55.423
I think she's dead.

00:57.458 --> 01:00.328
Dude, we got to do something.

01:00.428 --> 01:02.663
No, totally, you're right.

01:06.734 --> 01:09.437
No cap, we almost just died.

01:09.537 --> 01:10.704
There's this car here
on the side

01:10.804 --> 01:12.973
of the road, there's
money everywhere.

01:13.073 --> 01:15.209
I think this chick is dead.

01:25.719 --> 01:27.188
Did you lock the door?

01:27.288 --> 01:28.256
Yes.
Yes.

01:28.356 --> 01:30.391
Okay.

01:33.060 --> 01:33.994
Is it work?

01:34.094 --> 01:35.696
Uh...

01:37.064 --> 01:39.733
It's a guy I grew up with,
but it's probably,

01:39.833 --> 01:42.970
like, his call from jail
or something. Wait,

01:43.070 --> 01:44.104
did you need to get it?

01:44.205 --> 01:45.706
Uh...

01:47.074 --> 01:48.376
No.

01:48.476 --> 01:50.678
You know, he would understand.

01:50.778 --> 01:52.246
Yeah. Oh!
Yeah?

01:54.182 --> 01:56.684
He sounds like a bad influence.

01:58.051 --> 01:59.653
Oh, you go to cut people
like that out.

01:59.753 --> 02:01.189
Maybe you should block him.

02:01.289 --> 02:03.090
Oh, you got a lot of
people you block?
Mm-hmm.

02:03.191 --> 02:06.427
How many people you
got on that list?

02:06.527 --> 02:09.029
What?

02:09.129 --> 02:11.031
Okay.

02:11.131 --> 02:12.933
All right.

02:14.468 --> 02:16.670
It's work.
You can't block that.

02:16.770 --> 02:19.773
Whatever it is,
let's solve it fast.

02:29.350 --> 02:31.185
Here she is.

02:31.985 --> 02:34.588
Detective, you want
to take his statement?

02:35.856 --> 02:38.992
So, uh, you two
ride in together?

02:39.793 --> 02:42.430
Carpooling's good
for the planet, boss. Carpooling.

02:42.530 --> 02:44.164
That's what they're
calling it nowadays?

02:44.265 --> 02:45.499
Mm-hmm.

02:45.599 --> 02:47.401
You know, Catherine
told me that, uh, you two

02:47.501 --> 02:49.937
had to pump the brakes
on that, uh, search?

02:50.037 --> 02:51.272
For whoever killed her friend?

02:51.372 --> 02:52.406
Yeah.

02:52.506 --> 02:53.907
All right. Well,

02:54.007 --> 02:56.510
while I've got you,
I want you to run this.

02:56.610 --> 02:59.647
Our victim's name
is Mindy Downs.

02:59.747 --> 03:02.983
She was found dead in her car
by a group of teens.

03:03.083 --> 03:06.119
They carpooled up here
to quote/unquote,

03:06.220 --> 03:07.621
"drink in peace."

03:07.721 --> 03:09.089
Any other witnesses?

03:09.189 --> 03:12.393
That's the thing about
a ghost town-- nobody's talking.

03:12.493 --> 03:13.694
And the kids
weren't involved?

03:13.794 --> 03:16.063
No, I cleared 'em.
Neither set of tire tracks

03:16.163 --> 03:17.665
matched their vehicle.

03:17.765 --> 03:19.333
Two sets of tracks. Mm.

03:19.433 --> 03:22.303
So that's why highway patrol
called us all the way up here.

03:22.403 --> 03:24.838
That, and our kid driver
said that there was another car

03:24.938 --> 03:27.408
fishtailing out of the scene
when they drove up,

03:27.508 --> 03:28.842
almost hit 'em.

03:30.344 --> 03:33.247
And there's a little case

03:33.347 --> 03:35.849
of all this loose cash

03:35.949 --> 03:39.086
just floating around. Yep.

03:41.589 --> 03:43.123
Lots of it.

03:52.900 --> 03:55.135
Well, whoever hit her left
some of their headlight behind.

03:55.235 --> 03:56.804
And if she was rammed
into the telephone pole,

03:56.904 --> 03:58.272
the back end would be totaled,

03:58.372 --> 04:01.542
but it kind of looks like
she ran into it herself.

04:01.642 --> 04:02.876
Maybe, maybe not.

04:02.976 --> 04:04.378
You know how it is
with collisions--

04:04.478 --> 04:07.915
so much evidence,
so many possibilities. Mm.

04:08.015 --> 04:10.851
Mindy's registration
was in her glove compartment.

04:10.951 --> 04:14.488
She lives up the way.
Treasure Hill. Ooh.

04:14.588 --> 04:17.425
Looks like the bag
got tossed in the accident. Whoa.

04:17.525 --> 04:19.960
Somebody was on their way
out of town.

04:20.060 --> 04:22.930
Or robbed a stagecoach.

04:23.030 --> 04:25.265
Yeah, maybe we should
ask the barkeep at the saloon.

04:25.366 --> 04:26.500
Jack.

04:26.600 --> 04:28.802
Introduce us
to Ms. Downs.

04:28.902 --> 04:30.738
I've had all of three minutes
with her, but

04:30.838 --> 04:33.206
her liver temp puts her
time of death at 2:00 a.m.

04:33.307 --> 04:35.476
Contusions, abrasions,
broken nose.

04:35.576 --> 04:38.011
She didn't buckle up for safety.

04:38.111 --> 04:40.080
Well, the front end's
not totaled. She couldn't have

04:40.180 --> 04:43.016
been going more than 25 miles an
hour. And the airbag's deployed.

04:43.116 --> 04:45.719
I know. Her injuries
don't seem like they'd be fatal.

04:45.819 --> 04:46.820
So how'd she die?

04:46.920 --> 04:47.921
I don't think
the blood

04:48.021 --> 04:49.457
on her chest came from her nose.

04:49.557 --> 04:52.225
Hey, Jack, can you pull
Mindy back for me, please?

04:52.326 --> 04:53.961
Sure thing.

04:56.930 --> 04:59.633
Oh, would you look at that.

04:59.733 --> 05:02.069
Damn. That's
an entry wound.

05:02.169 --> 05:03.571
Road rage?

05:03.671 --> 05:05.272
Doesn't look like
it was motivated by money.

05:05.373 --> 05:07.641
They shot her and left
it all blowing around.

05:08.442 --> 05:11.779
No traffic cams.
No witnesses.

05:11.879 --> 05:13.514
Just ghosts.
You know,

05:13.614 --> 05:16.283
killers always
leave a trail, Joshua.

05:17.351 --> 05:19.587
Just have to find it.

Whoever shot Ms. Downs
wasn't in the car with her.

06:10.270 --> 06:11.939
I mean, it couldn't have been
that close, right?

06:12.039 --> 06:14.508
Can we see the slug?
Sonya's got to pull
it at autopsy.

06:14.608 --> 06:15.743
The last time I
disturbed evidence

06:15.843 --> 06:17.711
before it got to
my sister's morgue,

06:17.811 --> 06:20.380
she shaved off my eyebrows
in my sleep.

06:22.583 --> 06:24.518
My little sister scares me, too.

06:24.618 --> 06:26.186
I got ahold of the husband. Mm.

06:26.286 --> 06:29.923
He's gonna come in for an ID.
Thinking we get a GSR test.

06:30.023 --> 06:32.392
Catherine's back at the lab.
Ask her to run a kit.

06:32.493 --> 06:34.061
Your antennae up?

06:34.161 --> 06:36.129
I didn't love his vibe
on the phone. And, you know, Mm.

06:36.229 --> 06:39.199
spouses are always worth a look.

06:39.299 --> 06:41.469
Even if the smart money
is on road rage.

06:41.569 --> 06:43.471
Wouldn't be the first time somebody

06:43.571 --> 06:45.038
with a hair-trigger temper

06:45.138 --> 06:48.008
had a trigger
in their pocket, mm?

06:48.108 --> 06:49.743
That why you don't carry?

06:51.044 --> 06:52.345
Um, no.

06:52.446 --> 06:54.181
I'm not quick to temper.

06:54.281 --> 06:55.849
I just think that

06:55.949 --> 06:59.920
a criminalist's best weapon
is her brain.

07:02.523 --> 07:03.691
Hey, Al, how we doing?

07:03.791 --> 07:05.358
So...

07:05.459 --> 07:07.928
no bullet casings in the
car, no bullet casings

07:08.028 --> 07:10.831
within a 30-foot radius
outside the car.

07:10.931 --> 07:13.534
Maybe the killer knew well
enough to clean up their brass.

07:13.634 --> 07:14.902
Only thing I know for sure

07:15.002 --> 07:18.772
is tire tracks point to
Mindy driving south.

07:19.673 --> 07:22.976
<i>Maybe her killer intimidates
her from behind, clips her car.</i>

07:23.076 --> 07:25.378
<i>She's distracted
by his aggression,</i>

07:25.479 --> 07:26.446
<i>doesn't see the pole.</i>

07:26.547 --> 07:28.982
<i>But that wasn't enough for him.</i>

07:31.384 --> 07:32.920
Boom.

07:33.020 --> 07:34.722
Except...

07:34.822 --> 07:37.357
Mindy was shot
before she hit the pole.

07:37.457 --> 07:39.026
If she'd been shot

07:39.126 --> 07:40.894
after the accident...

07:40.994 --> 07:43.731
there'd be blood spatter
on the right side of the airbag,

07:43.831 --> 07:45.165
but look.

07:45.265 --> 07:48.736
There's no spatter,
and just blots. So...

07:48.836 --> 07:50.638
She was shot before the crash.

07:55.876 --> 07:57.645
Boy.

07:57.745 --> 07:59.479
They hit a target moving fast.
We're looking

07:59.580 --> 08:01.515
for a hell
of a shooter.

08:09.690 --> 08:12.926
I thought you just wanted
us to come and identify Mindy.

08:13.026 --> 08:14.528
I appreciate your help,
Mr. Downs.

08:14.628 --> 08:16.029
I know this can't be easy.

08:16.129 --> 08:20.400
This is just a standard test
for gunshot residue.

08:20.500 --> 08:22.670
To rule you out.
Bighorn season's

08:22.770 --> 08:24.705
just started. Uh,
I-I haven't even gone out yet,

08:24.805 --> 08:26.006
so you're not gonna
find anything on me.

08:26.106 --> 08:28.942
Mindy had a bag full
of cash and clothes

08:29.042 --> 08:30.477
in the back seat of her car.

08:31.311 --> 08:33.113
Was she going on a trip?

08:33.213 --> 08:35.282
I don't know.

08:35.382 --> 08:37.350
I don't know about the cash.
That's...

08:37.450 --> 08:39.720
I'm not sure.
I've been so busy

08:39.820 --> 08:42.122
at my garage-- I'm a mechanic--
and

08:42.222 --> 08:44.324
Mindy's been lonely.

08:44.424 --> 08:46.526
I think she was going her mom's.

08:46.627 --> 08:47.828
She was going to Mom's again?

08:49.997 --> 08:52.032
She didn't tell me that.

08:53.667 --> 08:55.502
Is that out of the ordinary?

08:57.070 --> 08:59.439
She usually tells me.

09:02.275 --> 09:03.210
You were right.

09:03.310 --> 09:05.078
Um, there's nothing here.

09:06.313 --> 09:07.948
We'll be in touch.

09:08.048 --> 09:09.683
Thank you.

09:14.788 --> 09:16.423
Amy.

09:19.092 --> 09:21.895
Call me if anything
occurs to you.

09:23.496 --> 09:25.132
Thanks.

09:36.076 --> 09:39.546
...22 long rifle stinger.
Hollow point.

09:39.647 --> 09:41.214
Not my first.
We see those a lot.

09:41.314 --> 09:42.816
Fits both pistols and rifles.

09:42.916 --> 09:46.987
The wound cavity is more compact
than expected for a .22.

09:47.087 --> 09:48.689
Something must have

09:48.789 --> 09:51.792
slowed the bullet down,
maybe ricocheted off a bone.

09:56.596 --> 09:58.298
I want a radiograph to be sure.
But first,

09:58.398 --> 10:00.167
let me get
your angle measurements.

10:00.901 --> 10:02.870
I'll need an extra hand
with that...

10:02.970 --> 10:03.937
Trajectory rod?

10:06.439 --> 10:08.575
Hm.

10:08.676 --> 10:11.578
I know Dr. Ramirez
did not like you.

10:12.545 --> 10:14.481
I think maybe he was wrong.

10:16.416 --> 10:18.852
Thank you. I guess.

10:30.964 --> 10:32.499
Thirty-six.

10:34.668 --> 10:36.069
Forty-two.

10:38.138 --> 10:40.007
Forty-four.

10:40.808 --> 10:42.409
Okay.

10:42.509 --> 10:44.477
Hey, what you got?

10:44.577 --> 10:46.079
Our shooter was a little behind
and to the right of Mindy,

10:46.179 --> 10:48.782
shooting downward.
About 42 degrees.

10:48.882 --> 10:50.450
That's a really steep angle.
Maybe the shot

10:50.550 --> 10:52.252
came from inside
a lifted pickup truck?

10:52.352 --> 10:53.721
But a pickup truck that large

10:53.821 --> 10:56.123
would have crushed her car
when they hit it, right?

10:56.223 --> 10:58.658
My next guess was
a monster truck. This...

10:58.759 --> 11:01.228
Sunday! Sunday! Sunday!

11:01.328 --> 11:03.897
Come on, you've never
heard of demolition derby?

11:03.997 --> 11:05.632
Mm-hmm, no.

11:05.733 --> 11:07.100
Okay, well, you know.

11:07.200 --> 11:09.136
Um, found the bullet, and...

11:09.236 --> 11:10.403
Hold on.

11:10.503 --> 11:13.106
Almost missed this.

11:13.206 --> 11:14.607
There's something on this.

11:15.542 --> 11:18.011
Yeah. Something green.

11:18.111 --> 11:20.080
It's like the bullet
passed through something

11:20.180 --> 11:21.681
before hitting Mindy.

11:21.782 --> 11:22.883
Or maybe they coated
their ammo with it?

11:22.983 --> 11:24.918
I'm gonna go get
Beau to run this.

11:25.018 --> 11:26.653
Sonya gave you
a itty bitty gift.

11:26.754 --> 11:28.989
Say thank you, Joshua.

11:29.089 --> 11:30.724
Thank you.

11:32.826 --> 11:35.528
Tiniest sample of all time.

11:35.628 --> 11:39.399
Well, like my wife
always says...

11:39.499 --> 11:41.769
a little goes a long way.

11:44.604 --> 11:46.840
When she's cooking with saffron.

11:47.875 --> 11:50.878
I'll, uh... go to Ballistics.

12:16.069 --> 12:17.404
That could be the thing
slowing it down.
It could.

12:17.504 --> 12:19.739
Boss?
It could... Yeah?

12:21.608 --> 12:23.610
Polypropylene, huh.

12:23.710 --> 12:26.346
Back in the private sector, we
used to put it in everything.

12:26.446 --> 12:28.681
Rope, twine, tape,

12:28.782 --> 12:30.683
carpeting,
upholstery,

12:30.784 --> 12:32.853
fast fashion, camping equipment,

12:32.953 --> 12:35.322
cooking equipment...
Shrimp cocktail,

12:35.422 --> 12:38.225
shrimp gumbo...
It's Beau-ba Gump.

12:38.325 --> 12:41.061
Do I have a sign on my back?
We only haze

12:41.161 --> 12:42.830
the ones we love,
and I think what Folsom

12:42.930 --> 12:44.564
is referring to
that every product

12:44.664 --> 12:46.033
in the world

12:46.133 --> 12:47.400
is not the lead
we're looking for.

12:47.500 --> 12:48.735
Maybe the shooter

12:48.836 --> 12:50.537
used a product made
from polypropylene

12:50.637 --> 12:53.373
as a makeshift silencer.

12:53.473 --> 12:54.942
I've been, uh,

12:55.042 --> 12:57.544
thinking about
what you're going through,

12:57.644 --> 13:00.780
and, uh, I know
it's got to be tough,

13:00.881 --> 13:03.216
working with Chavez, but

13:03.316 --> 13:05.953
I think if you give her a
chance, you'll really like her.

13:06.053 --> 13:07.387
What do you mean?
Wh...

13:07.487 --> 13:09.857
Have I been weir...

13:09.957 --> 13:13.026
Shut up, dude.

13:14.361 --> 13:16.296
Chavez is really pretty.

13:16.396 --> 13:19.466
You're just jealous that Folsom
got to her first, so don't

13:19.566 --> 13:20.767
take it out on me, okay?

13:20.868 --> 13:22.769
Touché.

13:28.141 --> 13:29.576
Seriously,

13:29.676 --> 13:31.144
have I been acting weird?

13:31.244 --> 13:33.646
Do people think I'm being rude?

13:35.248 --> 13:37.885
Let's get this into NIBIN
and see if we can get a match

13:37.985 --> 13:39.920
on some old crime.
I would love to stay

13:40.020 --> 13:41.788
and get teased mercilessly,

13:41.889 --> 13:43.523
but I'm needed
in Reconstruction.

13:43.623 --> 13:45.525
Huh. Interesting.

13:45.625 --> 13:47.127
I, uh...

13:47.227 --> 13:49.629
Yeah.
Folsom didn't text me.

13:49.729 --> 13:52.099
Stop.

13:56.236 --> 13:57.837
Oh.
Hey.

13:57.938 --> 14:00.173
So, the bullet
is running through NIBIN.

14:00.273 --> 14:03.210
Oh.
What have we here?

14:04.611 --> 14:06.079
Puzzle.

14:06.179 --> 14:08.481
Hm.
Headlight glass from the car
that crashed into Mindy.

14:08.581 --> 14:10.918
If we can figure out
the make and model of their car,

14:11.018 --> 14:12.986
might be able to ID the shooter.

14:15.122 --> 14:16.856
I mean, before I help you,
I am

14:16.957 --> 14:19.159
going to need to hear you
to say it.

14:21.962 --> 14:24.965
You are the jigsaw puzzle queen.

14:25.765 --> 14:28.568
See? That wasn't so hard,
was it, Joshua?

14:28.668 --> 14:30.370
Didn't like that.

14:39.612 --> 14:42.182
Yeah?
Yo, it's Trey.

14:44.051 --> 14:45.885
Hey, Trey.
What's going on, man?

14:45.986 --> 14:47.820
I tried calling,
so I came through.

14:47.921 --> 14:49.556
Why are you here?

14:49.656 --> 14:51.791
I need a favor.

14:54.661 --> 14:55.895
I got pranked.

14:55.996 --> 14:57.330
Someone filled my car

14:57.430 --> 14:58.966
with freakin' weasels.
Hundreds of 'em, man.

14:59.066 --> 15:02.735
Weasel-- your, uh, your
old nickname, right?

15:02.835 --> 15:04.571
Well, I got to get
whoever it is back.

15:04.671 --> 15:07.274
I figure all our friends
are already in the system.

15:08.908 --> 15:10.743
Can you lift the prints,

15:10.843 --> 15:12.512
help me figure out

15:12.612 --> 15:14.181
which of the pricks did it?

15:14.281 --> 15:15.648
I'd love to help to you, man,
but we have a policy against

15:15.748 --> 15:17.584
using work equipment
for personal use.

15:17.684 --> 15:19.286
You got it good here, Folsom.

15:19.386 --> 15:20.620
Hi, I'm Trey.

15:20.720 --> 15:22.289
Hey. Allie.

15:22.389 --> 15:24.357
This is Allie?

15:24.457 --> 15:26.393
Oh, I've heard about you.

15:26.493 --> 15:27.694
Yeah...

15:27.794 --> 15:29.829
I get it.
Uh, hey,

15:29.929 --> 15:31.264
we-we got, uh... Huh?

15:31.364 --> 15:33.200
Allie's got
some work to do, so... Yeah.

15:33.300 --> 15:34.267
Bye, Allie.

15:34.367 --> 15:35.635
Bye, Trey. Oh.

15:35.735 --> 15:38.838
Oh, I, uh, talked to your mom
the other day.

15:38.938 --> 15:41.374
Jeanette-- she's out?

15:41.474 --> 15:43.676
Yeah, got her some scratchers,

15:43.776 --> 15:45.845
say welcome home.

15:45.945 --> 15:47.480
Yeah, she was always
like a mom to me, too,

15:47.580 --> 15:50.984
so, you know, yeah, no biggie.

15:51.084 --> 15:53.320
Hey-hey, you know what, man...

15:55.788 --> 15:56.856
I'll see what I can do.

15:56.956 --> 15:59.326
Thanks.
Thanks, brother.

15:59.426 --> 16:01.261
All right.

16:07.934 --> 16:09.536
He seems fun.

16:09.636 --> 16:10.903
Huh.

16:12.705 --> 16:17.444
Um, is it possible that Mindy's
car was hit by Mindy's car?

16:17.544 --> 16:19.079
So, wh... I-I'm sorry...

16:19.179 --> 16:21.114
The broken headlight
at the scene is the same

16:21.214 --> 16:24.784
make and model of car
as Mindy's. Look.

16:27.620 --> 16:30.523
I am the queen of jigsaw
puzzles, aren't I?

16:34.061 --> 16:36.229
So, this is
your car, right?

16:36.329 --> 16:37.797
Uh-huh.

16:37.897 --> 16:40.400
Headlight.
Yeah?

16:40.500 --> 16:43.036
And this is Mindy's car.

16:43.136 --> 16:44.437
Same make and model.

16:44.537 --> 16:46.339
Yeah. Yeah, I fix Saabs,

16:46.439 --> 16:49.476
and, uh, we both
love them, so, I...

16:49.576 --> 16:50.943
I bought got her one.

16:51.044 --> 16:52.945
You are a hunter.

16:56.783 --> 16:59.186
Do you own any
...22 caliber weapons?

16:59.286 --> 17:00.487
I don't.

17:00.587 --> 17:01.921
I prefer a heavier gauge.

17:02.021 --> 17:03.723
One shot, one kill.
You got any

17:03.823 --> 17:04.957
hunting buddies with a .22

17:05.058 --> 17:06.426
willing to let you
borrow theirs?

17:06.526 --> 17:09.962
I did not hurt my wife.
Well, I think

17:10.063 --> 17:11.964
Mindy finally worked up
the nerve to pack a bag,

17:12.065 --> 17:14.467
grab some cash and leave you.
But you wouldn't let her.
No, she wasn't

17:14.567 --> 17:17.137
leaving me.
Your sister-in-law Amy
seems to think she was.

17:17.237 --> 17:19.172
This is ridiculous.
How did your

17:19.272 --> 17:21.374
broken headlight
end up at the scene?

17:23.042 --> 17:26.045
Mindy called me, okay?

17:26.146 --> 17:27.380
But it went straight
to voice mail.

17:27.480 --> 17:29.949
And when I finally
got the message...

17:31.551 --> 17:32.385
...she sounded hurt.

17:32.485 --> 17:35.088
So I raced down the road.

17:35.188 --> 17:36.689
I was so freaked out

17:36.789 --> 17:40.059
that I missed the brake
and I slid into her.

17:40.860 --> 17:42.829
But she, uh...

17:42.929 --> 17:44.231
she was already dead.

17:44.331 --> 17:46.366
You expect us
to believe that?

17:46.466 --> 17:48.868
You left when you saw
Mindy was dead.

17:51.538 --> 17:52.739
Why didn't you call 911?

17:52.839 --> 17:55.108
I got scared.

17:55.208 --> 17:57.477
I d...
You didn't want to be a suspect.

18:00.380 --> 18:03.082
My marriage-- it wasn't perfect.

18:04.251 --> 18:05.818
But I loved Mindy.

18:05.918 --> 18:07.920
And I had nothing

18:08.020 --> 18:10.523
to do with this.

18:10.623 --> 18:12.091
You have to believe me.

18:12.192 --> 18:14.427
Hell, take Mindy's
word for it.

18:26.038 --> 18:28.575
I'm sorry.

18:28.675 --> 18:31.511
I... I'm hurt, I need your help.

18:37.083 --> 18:39.386
I think the husband's
telling the truth.

18:39.486 --> 18:42.655
It sounds like she was shot
well before she wrecked.

18:42.755 --> 18:44.257
Makes sense.

18:44.357 --> 18:47.093
I think we can work backwards
from where she crashed.

18:47.194 --> 18:48.161
Use her voice mail
as a reference

18:48.261 --> 18:49.462
and find the
exact location

18:49.562 --> 18:51.130
she was shot.
You hear that screech

18:51.231 --> 18:52.532
just before it ended?

18:54.133 --> 18:55.402
I'm hurt, I need your help.

18:56.836 --> 18:58.705
She scraped something.

18:58.805 --> 19:00.973
Well, the shot
had to happen before that.

19:26.098 --> 19:28.301
Hey.
This could be the spot.

19:28.401 --> 19:31.238
Looks like she jerked the wheel
without braking.

19:31.338 --> 19:33.806
I mean, that would cause
these centrifugal skid marks.

19:33.906 --> 19:35.542
I call them yaw marks.

19:35.642 --> 19:38.177
Right. I bet getting
shot in the neck

19:38.278 --> 19:39.712
would explain the suddenness...

19:39.812 --> 19:41.180
Centrifugal
skid marks.

19:41.281 --> 19:42.682
You think this is where
Mindy was shot?

19:42.782 --> 19:44.551
That's the theory.

19:49.222 --> 19:51.624
So, where was the shooter
when they took their shot?

19:51.724 --> 19:53.860
There's no shoulder
on the road here.

19:53.960 --> 19:56.696
It would be impossible for
someone to drive alongside her.

19:56.796 --> 20:00.132
Or even stand to take a shot
at a speeding motorist.

20:00.233 --> 20:01.634
And even if she was
in the oncoming lane,

20:01.734 --> 20:03.436
the shooter would be too
close. The wound cavity

20:03.536 --> 20:06.072
would be larger. Plus, it's-it's
not even the right angle.

20:06.172 --> 20:07.307
...22LR cartridges

20:07.407 --> 20:09.542
can also used by rifles.

20:09.642 --> 20:12.545
Well, that would explain
the compact permanent cavity.

20:12.645 --> 20:13.880
I can't believe I'm
about to say this,

20:13.980 --> 20:14.981
but we might
be looking for

20:15.081 --> 20:16.549
a long-range marksman

20:16.649 --> 20:18.217
who knows how
to lead a target in motion.

20:18.318 --> 20:21.554
You think Mindy was shot
from up in the hills...

20:21.654 --> 20:22.822
by, like, a sniper?

20:22.922 --> 20:23.856
Yes.
Yes.

20:23.956 --> 20:25.157
Well.

20:25.258 --> 20:26.593
The Wonder Twins
are in agreement.

20:26.693 --> 20:29.161
So...

20:29.262 --> 20:33.199
our search area just got
a hell of a lot bigger.

20:43.710 --> 20:45.412
That looks about 33 centimeters.

20:45.512 --> 20:48.948
Now I really don't know
where the shooter was standing.

20:49.949 --> 20:53.753
I think 60% load
is still way too high.

20:54.587 --> 20:57.189
Killer had to be
over 500 yards away.

20:57.290 --> 20:58.425
You're right.

20:58.525 --> 20:59.592
The bullet would've
punctured Mindy's lungs

20:59.692 --> 21:00.993
at this depth.

21:01.093 --> 21:03.095
Okay, well,
maybe 50% load capacity

21:03.195 --> 21:05.231
is enough
to slow our bullet down.

21:05.332 --> 21:07.367
Have you talked to Trey?

21:08.701 --> 21:10.169
No.

21:11.170 --> 21:12.238
Why?

21:13.406 --> 21:14.807
Yeah, Trey's a nice guy.

21:14.907 --> 21:16.208
When he wants something.

21:16.309 --> 21:19.779
I'd probably be smart
to block his number.

21:23.716 --> 21:25.785
Firing one at 50%.

21:36.996 --> 21:39.031
Firing one at 20%.

21:44.036 --> 21:46.739
Are you at least
going to run the prints for him?

21:46.839 --> 21:49.108
I don't know.

21:49.208 --> 21:51.043
11 centimeters.

21:53.713 --> 21:55.615
360 feet per second

21:55.715 --> 21:58.585
at 20% load capacity. Wow,

21:58.685 --> 22:00.620
we're gonna have a broad search
radius no matter the result.

22:00.720 --> 22:02.188
We'll be canvassing
for days.

22:02.288 --> 22:03.590
I can go ahead
and start the canvassing

22:03.690 --> 22:05.291
if you want to hang back.

22:05.392 --> 22:06.426
What?

22:06.526 --> 22:07.994
Run those prints for Trey.

22:08.094 --> 22:10.797
Allie...
My childhood friends
are just like you guys.

22:10.897 --> 22:13.332
We've grown up
and we've grown apart.

22:13.433 --> 22:16.803
But those old friends--
there's...

22:16.903 --> 22:18.405
there's roots under the wall.

22:18.505 --> 22:22.208
I don't see them and we're
in different places, but...

22:22.308 --> 22:24.511
I thrive today

22:24.611 --> 22:26.379
because of them.

22:32.619 --> 22:34.387
Is this right?

22:35.988 --> 22:39.792
So, somebody shot Mindy
from almost a mile away?

22:39.892 --> 22:40.993
Velocity was our
missing quotient,

22:41.093 --> 22:42.395
and the numbers don't lie.

22:42.495 --> 22:45.164
We're talking about
army sniper accuracy.

22:45.264 --> 22:47.834
Someone with
a world-class skill set...

22:47.934 --> 22:50.336
targeting a paralegal?

22:50.437 --> 22:52.405
Or it's random.
Like a roadside sniper,

22:52.505 --> 22:54.106
like Malvo in Virginia.

22:54.206 --> 22:56.443
Mm, I don't think it's either.

22:56.543 --> 22:58.511
Look, this is the search radius.

22:58.611 --> 23:00.880
This is Mindy's home in
Treasure Hill, up in the hills

23:00.980 --> 23:03.282
above the road
from where she was shot.

23:03.382 --> 23:06.953
Mindy's husband
is an avid hunter.

23:07.053 --> 23:09.789
This shot could have come
from her own backyard.

23:09.889 --> 23:12.725
If it did,
somebody had to hear it.

23:16.028 --> 23:20.833
Nobody heard anything.
And we have talked to everyone.

23:24.036 --> 23:26.172
We haven't talked to him yet.

23:27.239 --> 23:28.841
Hey, boys.

23:28.941 --> 23:32.078
Any of you hear a gunshot
two nights ago?

23:32.178 --> 23:33.513
I heard a gunshot
the other night.

23:33.613 --> 23:35.247
No, no, those
were fireworks.

23:35.347 --> 23:37.884
Uh, Reggie, those jackholes,
they were letting 'em off.

23:37.984 --> 23:39.819
Nah, they ran out of fireworks
on Thursday.

23:39.919 --> 23:41.420
When Reggie pushed you.

23:41.521 --> 23:42.722
How old are you, dude?
Don't you know

23:42.822 --> 23:44.290
what a gunshot sounds like?

23:44.390 --> 23:46.258
Yeah, those were fireworks,
you idiot.

23:46.358 --> 23:48.094
Hey, hey,
Hey, Cash,

23:48.194 --> 23:50.963
knock it off.
not in... uh, Cash,
Cash, Cash, Cash.

23:51.063 --> 23:53.399
Don't you got any sense,
fighting in front of cops?

23:53.500 --> 23:55.902
Hey, guys, found something.

23:56.002 --> 23:57.470
You go, I got this.

23:59.572 --> 24:02.241
Hey, trailer park front office
put these out a few days ago.

24:02.341 --> 24:05.645
Advertising for the new lots.
First expansion in years.

24:05.745 --> 24:06.713
Looks like

24:06.813 --> 24:09.015
the bullet hit this.

24:09.115 --> 24:10.817
Just grazed the balloon.

24:13.185 --> 24:15.855
Guess we can add balloons
to that long list of things

24:15.955 --> 24:17.824
made from polypropylene, huh?

24:17.924 --> 24:19.091
All right,
I want us to spiral search

24:19.191 --> 24:21.327
from this point out.
The guy must have

24:21.427 --> 24:24.330
left some casings here.
I want it.

24:42.481 --> 24:43.550
Entering grid six.

24:43.650 --> 24:45.184
Copy that.

24:56.162 --> 24:59.498
I found shell casings
in the field

24:59.599 --> 25:00.900
behind the trailer park.

25:01.000 --> 25:03.235
Copy. Headed to you.

25:04.704 --> 25:06.372
Come here.

25:14.914 --> 25:16.315
That was quick.

25:19.852 --> 25:21.220
Max?

25:28.427 --> 25:29.829
Max. Look at me.
Open your eyes. Come on.

25:29.929 --> 25:31.430
Why would someone do this?

25:31.530 --> 25:32.699
Everyone get back.
Give her some air.

25:32.799 --> 25:34.567
Johnson, Rubio,
set the perimeter.

25:34.667 --> 25:36.068
We find this bastard now.

25:36.168 --> 25:37.336
Ambulance is here.

25:37.436 --> 25:38.404
Over here!

25:38.504 --> 25:40.072
Help's here.

25:41.941 --> 25:43.409
Hand me a glove.

25:49.582 --> 25:51.383
She saved us a shell casing.

25:51.483 --> 25:52.885
Unreal.

25:54.253 --> 25:56.889
Ms. Roby. Can you hear me?

25:56.989 --> 25:58.557
We've got to get her
to the hospital.

26:04.964 --> 26:06.699
Folsom.
Hey.

26:06.799 --> 26:08.534
How bad is it?
Found her unconscious.

26:08.635 --> 26:10.970
There may be some
swelling on her brain.

26:11.070 --> 26:13.840
They've sedated her
out of an abundance of caution

26:13.940 --> 26:16.375
to let her rest,
but she's stable for now.

26:16.475 --> 26:18.077
Okay.

26:19.078 --> 26:20.813
Catherine, I messed up.
I was at the lab,

26:20.913 --> 26:22.481
helping my idiot friend. I...

26:22.581 --> 26:25.417
She made me point on this.
I should have been there.
Don't.

26:25.517 --> 26:26.753
I've been where you're going.

26:26.853 --> 26:29.255
Guilty when it's not my fault. Hell,

26:29.355 --> 26:31.791
it's that way with my daughter
right now. All you can do

26:31.891 --> 26:33.793
is to focus
your energy

26:33.893 --> 26:34.827
on this case.

26:34.927 --> 26:36.863
That's all you can do for her.

26:36.963 --> 26:38.998
Okay, so we got to assume that
the person who attacked Max

26:39.098 --> 26:41.333
is the shooter, right? If she
was collecting evidence...

26:41.433 --> 26:42.835
Agreed.
Whoever they are

26:42.935 --> 26:44.570
heard the CSIs were canvassing

26:44.671 --> 26:46.739
and they came back
to clean up after themself.

26:46.839 --> 26:49.441
This is your case.
How do you want to proceed?

27:01.253 --> 27:03.622
All right, guys, listen up.
We run it.

27:03.723 --> 27:06.092
All of it, all at once.

27:06.192 --> 27:07.493
Let's go.

27:07.593 --> 27:09.395
Allie, Chris, I want
to know everything

27:09.495 --> 27:12.098
about that casing
Max recovered.

27:12.198 --> 27:14.100
The .22 long rifle
casing Max found

27:14.200 --> 27:16.435
matches the bullet
found in Mindy.

27:16.535 --> 27:17.970
The, uh, casing
should help NIBIN

27:18.070 --> 27:19.806
narrow down our matches faster.

27:19.906 --> 27:21.941
It's, uh, not done
processing, but I've

27:22.041 --> 27:24.443
obviated some of the
possibilities. Take a look.

27:24.543 --> 27:26.612
There's only rifles
left on this list.

27:26.713 --> 27:28.815
So we were right
about a sniper.

27:28.915 --> 27:30.016
Huh.

27:30.116 --> 27:32.518
The firing pin impression
on our casing--

27:32.618 --> 27:35.354
it's, uh...
Something's off about it.

27:37.023 --> 27:38.624
We have a match.

27:42.561 --> 27:44.530
Okay, so,

27:44.630 --> 27:46.799
the killer's weapon
was a Ruger 10/22.

27:46.899 --> 27:48.801
Manufactured
over 30 years ago. And...

27:48.901 --> 27:51.437
Wow. Look at
that history.

27:51.537 --> 27:55.708
Armed robberies, home invasion,
and sold at a police auction.

27:55.808 --> 27:58.310
If the gun was a person
it'd be behind bars.

27:58.410 --> 28:01.247
Check out the most recent owner.

28:04.150 --> 28:06.052
Do you recognize this?

28:06.152 --> 28:10.056
So hot.
Can't hear myself think.

28:10.156 --> 28:13.760
Damn kids threw a rock through
my window and air ain't free.

28:13.860 --> 28:15.527
Um, what are we
talking about?

28:15.627 --> 28:17.163
Okay, Theresa,

28:17.263 --> 28:19.631
let's just knock it off
with the sudoku.

28:19.732 --> 28:21.200
People usually pay attention

28:21.300 --> 28:22.869
when they're being
questioned about murder.

28:22.969 --> 28:25.204
I've seen a rifle before, yeah.

28:26.338 --> 28:29.375
A rifle like this one was used
to kill one of your neighbors.

28:29.475 --> 28:31.911
We think the shooter
also attacked our boss.

28:32.011 --> 28:34.346
Yeah, I heard about
the shooting.
Our records

28:34.446 --> 28:37.316
show that a rifle
like this one in the picture

28:37.416 --> 28:39.819
was registered to your address.

28:39.919 --> 28:42.121
Can we take a look
at your rifle?
Sure.

28:42.221 --> 28:43.655
If you can find it.

28:43.756 --> 28:46.558
That rifle was stolen
some time ago.

28:46.658 --> 28:48.127
I had a barbecue
for my neighbors

28:48.227 --> 28:50.596
out of the kindness of my heart,
and somebody janked it.

28:50.696 --> 28:52.664
And you didn't
think to report it, no?

28:52.765 --> 28:56.002
Mm. No, ma'am,
it was a piece of crap.

28:59.038 --> 29:02.909
Was Robbie Downs
invited to your party?

29:03.009 --> 29:04.844
That wino?
Of course not.

29:06.512 --> 29:08.915
But he sure enough crashed it.

29:10.950 --> 29:12.118
Hey.

29:12.218 --> 29:13.853
Drink this.

29:18.390 --> 29:19.992
Hey.

29:20.092 --> 29:21.828
Heard anything
about Max?

29:22.628 --> 29:24.596
Not since you asked
the last time.

29:26.665 --> 29:28.000
What's this?

29:28.100 --> 29:29.301
Well,

29:29.401 --> 29:31.103
given the placement
of Max's head wound

29:31.203 --> 29:33.940
and this sneaker print
found under Max,

29:34.040 --> 29:35.741
<i>we think Max was hit by someone</i>

29:35.842 --> 29:37.443
<i>swinging with
their left hand, so</i>

29:37.543 --> 29:40.112
ten percent of all people
on Earth are a suspect.

29:40.212 --> 29:42.448
Other than that, we got
nothing. Like, we got rocks,

29:42.548 --> 29:44.316
we got dirt, that's it.

29:56.195 --> 29:57.696
You know what?

29:58.865 --> 30:01.400
Uh, I-I will
take that water now.

30:01.500 --> 30:04.036
What's going on, there, bud?

30:04.136 --> 30:06.172
I kept asking myself

30:06.272 --> 30:07.974
what in this field
doesn't belong.

30:08.074 --> 30:10.209
But that wasn't working,
so then I asked myself

30:10.309 --> 30:11.844
what does belong.

30:11.944 --> 30:13.112
What's the difference?

30:13.212 --> 30:14.713
I don't know.

30:14.813 --> 30:16.315
But I missed it

30:16.415 --> 30:20.352
because it was covered in dust,
dirt and debris.

30:24.623 --> 30:26.258
Look at this.

30:27.659 --> 30:28.961
Concrete.

30:30.262 --> 30:31.898
Smell the ammonia.

30:31.998 --> 30:33.532
They use it as an admixture

30:33.632 --> 30:34.833
to reduce the water
in the concrete.

30:34.934 --> 30:36.668
The-the smell
won't dissipate for days.

30:36.768 --> 30:37.970
So it's fresh.

30:38.070 --> 30:40.940
You know, I saw
construction over there.

30:46.145 --> 30:48.380
This concrete
was poured yesterday?

30:48.480 --> 30:50.749
It only takes a few hours
to harden, about a month

30:50.849 --> 30:52.584
to fully cure.
It could be worse.

30:52.684 --> 30:54.053
Keep digging.

30:54.153 --> 30:57.556
If we don't find anything,
that would be worse.

30:57.656 --> 30:59.125
Look, I got to say,

30:59.225 --> 31:01.193
if the killer made their way
to Max from this angle--

31:01.293 --> 31:04.296
plenty of weapons lying around
to take a swing at her head.

31:04.396 --> 31:05.998
Yeah.

31:09.801 --> 31:12.905
Hey.
I think I got it!

31:19.078 --> 31:20.612
It's a Ruger 10/22.

31:20.712 --> 31:23.315
That's our rifle.
It's what we've
been looking for.

31:24.216 --> 31:26.285
What's wrong?
I don't understand
how that rifle

31:26.385 --> 31:28.120
could have been used
to kill Mindy Downs.

31:28.220 --> 31:30.957
No scope.
No rail to even add one.

31:31.057 --> 31:33.759
So, who could make that
miracle shot without a scope?

31:33.859 --> 31:35.327
Who has that kind of aim?

31:37.663 --> 31:39.265
Nobody.

31:50.076 --> 31:52.844
That's as clean
as this rifle's getting.

31:52.945 --> 31:56.715
Looks like it was junk before
it got tossed into cement.

31:57.549 --> 31:59.351
You people want
some good news?

31:59.451 --> 32:01.954
Heard from the hospital.
Max's swelling is down.

32:02.054 --> 32:05.124
Grade 2 concussion.
Broken clavicle got set.

32:05.224 --> 32:06.858
She's gonna be okay.

32:06.959 --> 32:09.895
Thank God.
Should be up and ready
for visitors tomorrow.

32:11.263 --> 32:12.398
Folsom?

32:12.498 --> 32:13.799
I'll, um...

32:13.899 --> 32:16.168
I'll go when I can
show her a mug shot.

32:16.268 --> 32:18.170
And I might be

32:18.270 --> 32:20.039
getting close.

32:20.139 --> 32:21.707
I couldn't

32:21.807 --> 32:24.343
wrap my mind around how
that 30-year-old rifle

32:24.443 --> 32:28.047
without a scope
made that incredible shot.

32:28.147 --> 32:30.349
Check out the pin impression
on the casing that Max found.

32:30.449 --> 32:32.818
Well, Chris did mention
it was odd.

32:32.918 --> 32:34.820
These are also casings
from our rifle

32:34.920 --> 32:37.189
found at old crime scenes,
unrelated shootings.

32:37.289 --> 32:38.590
You notice the difference?

32:38.690 --> 32:40.926
Our firing pin impression
looks deeper?

32:41.027 --> 32:42.128
It is.

32:42.228 --> 32:44.030
The casing on the right
came from a rifle

32:44.130 --> 32:47.166
shooting straight on,
according the case report.

32:47.266 --> 32:48.534
Its impression
isn't as deep.

32:48.634 --> 32:50.369
The casing on the left
came from a rifle

32:50.469 --> 32:52.671
that was pointed down.

32:52.771 --> 32:56.208
Pretty shallow.
So our case being the deepest

32:56.308 --> 32:59.745
means that our rifle
was shot pointing upwards?

32:59.845 --> 33:02.848
Exactly. I didn't always
love physics as a kid,

33:02.948 --> 33:06.985
but today I want to buy
Isaac Newton a beer.

33:07.086 --> 33:08.420
More pressure is needed

33:08.520 --> 33:10.456
to fight gravity when
a rifle's pointed up,

33:10.556 --> 33:11.923
so it makes the firing pin
strike harder,

33:12.024 --> 33:14.626
leaving behind
a deep pin impression.

33:17.863 --> 33:19.998
Snipers don't point up to shoot.

33:20.099 --> 33:21.200
No, they don't.

33:21.300 --> 33:23.435
Nobody took aim at Mindy Downs.

33:24.836 --> 33:27.106
Her death was an accident. So,

33:27.206 --> 33:28.640
if this was random--

33:28.740 --> 33:32.311
if there's no connection
between Mindy and her killer--

33:32.411 --> 33:36.148
whoever attacked Max
is our last shot.

33:36.248 --> 33:37.316
No.

33:37.416 --> 33:39.085
No?
There's a missing piece.

33:39.185 --> 33:40.752
I mean literally.

33:42.221 --> 33:44.856
There's a piece missing
where the rifle's cracked.

33:44.956 --> 33:46.425
Stock looks
pretty dried out.

33:46.525 --> 33:48.427
Old rifles can snap
on the kickback.

33:48.527 --> 33:49.728
Hm.

33:50.729 --> 33:52.564
I think I know who shot Mindy.

33:52.664 --> 33:56.868
Just hold
still for me.

33:56.968 --> 33:58.504
Ooh.

33:58.604 --> 34:00.106
You're lucky.

34:00.206 --> 34:02.774
A splinter like this
could get badly infected.

34:09.481 --> 34:12.751
Then again,
maybe you're not so lucky.

34:13.552 --> 34:14.586
I...

34:14.686 --> 34:15.721
I didn't
shoot that woman.

34:15.821 --> 34:17.623
I...
Cash, shush.

34:17.723 --> 34:20.426
So my grandson
shot my rifle.

34:20.526 --> 34:23.829
Big whoop.
It is a big whoop, actually,
Theresa, 'cause you lied to me.

34:23.929 --> 34:25.897
You told me the
rifle was stolen.

34:25.997 --> 34:27.366
Cash,

34:27.466 --> 34:30.402
your friend-- he pointed us

34:30.502 --> 34:31.903
to the kids down the street.

34:32.904 --> 34:35.707
They said that they
broke your window.

34:35.807 --> 34:38.277
They were bullying
you, right Cash?

34:42.814 --> 34:45.016
Hey trash, you got our present?

34:46.084 --> 34:47.653
The hell?

34:47.753 --> 34:49.455
You're not gonna
shoot that thing, are you?

34:49.555 --> 34:52.858
Leave me alone!

35:03.969 --> 35:05.971
My grandson
didn't kill that woman

35:06.071 --> 35:07.606
or hurt your boss

35:07.706 --> 35:10.642
or whatever else.
This is harassment!

35:18.850 --> 35:20.786
Nothing in the kid's room.

35:26.925 --> 35:29.661
You don't have any proof,
not one bit of proof

35:29.761 --> 35:31.897
that he raised a hand
to your boss.

35:32.898 --> 35:34.132
None.

35:34.233 --> 35:37.703
The kid didn't attack Max.

35:37.803 --> 35:39.505
Mindy's shooter
was right-handed,

35:39.605 --> 35:41.240
as evidenced by the splinter

35:41.340 --> 35:42.974
in Cash's right cheek.

35:43.074 --> 35:45.211
But Max's attacker
was left-handed.

35:48.079 --> 35:50.782
You sudoku with
your left hand, Theresa.

35:52.884 --> 35:54.853
Are you out of your mind?

35:54.953 --> 35:56.888
These are women's jeans

35:56.988 --> 35:58.890
with cement all over them.
You knew

35:58.990 --> 36:00.292
we were searching the park
for evidence, and you knew

36:00.392 --> 36:02.328
that Cash shot Mindy
after Allie and Catherine

36:02.428 --> 36:03.929
showed up at your house.

36:08.900 --> 36:13.339
<i>So you got rid of the rifle.</i>

36:13.439 --> 36:16.508
<i>But then you saw my boss, Max,
out in the field.</i>

36:16.608 --> 36:20.145
<i>And Cash hadn't picked up his
casings, so you had to.</i>

36:29.187 --> 36:32.458
I fought so hard

36:32.558 --> 36:35.661
to get custody
from Cash's mother.

36:35.761 --> 36:39.731
All I wanted was
a better life for him. Please.

36:40.699 --> 36:42.934
Please, don't do this to us.

36:45.271 --> 36:47.473
Stand up for me, please.

36:47.573 --> 36:50.942
♪ Now I'll show you my dark... ♪

36:51.643 --> 36:54.346

Granny?

I'm...

36:59.050 --> 37:00.686
I'm so sorry.

37:34.620 --> 37:35.987
We heard you found the shooter.

37:36.087 --> 37:38.390
It was an accident?

37:38.490 --> 37:40.158
That doesn't make any sense.

37:40.258 --> 37:43.362
She's gone, and that part
will never make sense.

37:43.462 --> 37:45.731
But we're sure.

37:49.568 --> 37:51.637
I am so sorry.

37:55.574 --> 37:56.842
So, what--

37:56.942 --> 37:59.177
you're not gonna apologize?

37:59.945 --> 38:01.647
I'm innocent.

38:01.747 --> 38:03.349
I lost my wife.

38:04.616 --> 38:06.685
And you made me
feel like a criminal.

38:06.785 --> 38:08.019
You're right.

38:08.854 --> 38:10.322
You didn't shoot Mindy.

38:10.422 --> 38:13.725
But you also didn't call 911
when you saw she was dead.

38:13.825 --> 38:15.260
'Cause you'd
be a suspect.

38:15.361 --> 38:18.797
And you know why.
She was going to leave you.

38:21.232 --> 38:24.102
You put Mindy
in the path of that bullet.

38:24.202 --> 38:26.838
And you'll have to live with
that for the rest of your life.

38:44.923 --> 38:46.725
So?

38:47.526 --> 38:48.627
Who was it?

38:48.727 --> 38:50.729
It was Shank, right?

38:50.829 --> 38:52.398
Got to be Shank.

38:55.867 --> 38:58.303
Why'd you want me
to ID those prints, Trey?

38:58.404 --> 39:01.006
What, for real?

39:01.106 --> 39:03.775
Man, you're such a cop.

39:05.744 --> 39:08.414
I told you why.
The... guys

39:08.514 --> 39:11.783
played a prank on me,
I want to get 'em back.

39:14.853 --> 39:16.788
You ghosted us.

39:18.223 --> 39:20.358
Ghosted us, you left us behind
'cause you thought

39:20.459 --> 39:22.428
you were better than us.
Better than me.

39:22.528 --> 39:24.530
No, no, no, you stayed.

39:24.630 --> 39:26.532
I tried to help you get out.

39:26.632 --> 39:28.900
You called me for help, man.

39:29.000 --> 39:30.502
And I screwed up letting you

39:30.602 --> 39:33.004
take that car, man.
I shouldn't have asked.

39:34.573 --> 39:37.576
Well, you already know, Fols,
no favor comes free.

39:38.376 --> 39:39.945
You know, Trey,
you should really stop trying

39:40.045 --> 39:41.613
to track down meth distributors

39:41.713 --> 39:42.881
and maybe you should just

39:42.981 --> 39:45.150
stick to repo'ing cars and TVs.

39:46.552 --> 39:48.353
You ran the prints.

39:49.988 --> 39:52.090
All I need's a name.

39:54.259 --> 39:56.495
Hey, I'll take it from there.

40:04.135 --> 40:06.371
That's how it's gonna be?

40:12.744 --> 40:14.980
I'll see you around, Fols.

40:34.600 --> 40:35.834
Yeah, come in.

40:40.472 --> 40:41.773
Hey.

40:41.873 --> 40:43.775
There she is.

40:43.875 --> 40:45.176
How you feeling?

40:45.276 --> 40:47.245
Never been better.

40:50.549 --> 40:53.552
Hey.
Hmm?

40:53.652 --> 40:55.186
We got the shooter.

40:56.121 --> 40:59.424
We also got, uh, your...

40:59.525 --> 41:01.159
attacker.

41:07.365 --> 41:08.834
I'm sorry.

41:09.968 --> 41:11.469
For not being there.

41:13.438 --> 41:15.073
I got caught up

41:15.173 --> 41:17.643
fixing things
that weren't mine to fix.

41:17.743 --> 41:19.244
If I had carried...

41:19.344 --> 41:20.879
No, that wouldn't have helped.

41:20.979 --> 41:22.581
Not this time.

41:26.351 --> 41:28.419
I'm sorry.

41:34.459 --> 41:36.094
What's in the bag?

41:38.029 --> 41:39.998
Got you a Double-Double.

41:41.633 --> 41:43.735
I know you were
looking forward to that

41:43.835 --> 41:46.471
cafeteria
chicken piccata, but...

42:06.357 --> 42:07.859
Come on, Double-Double.
