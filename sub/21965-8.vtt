A wind-powered work of art.

00:06.959 --> 00:08.375
Heh, I always thought

00:06.959 --> 00:08.375
those things

00:08.417 --> 00:10.625
were power line decorations.

00:10.667 --> 00:13.125
Watch how high

00:10.667 --> 00:13.125
I can make it go.

00:15.125 --> 00:17.083
Too much string, Blades.

00:15.125 --> 00:17.083
Look out for that...

00:20.166 --> 00:22.750
...tree.

00:20.166 --> 00:22.750
If it had an engine, propeller,

00:22.792 --> 00:25.542
or even rudimentary steering,

00:22.792 --> 00:25.542
that could have been avoided.

00:25.583 --> 00:27.333
But then

00:25.583 --> 00:27.333
it wouldn't be a kite.

CODY:

00:28.875 --> 00:31.625
That's Taylor's plane.

DANI ( over radio ):

00:48.291 --> 00:52.125
Taylor, steer the plane away

00:48.291 --> 00:52.125
from the island and bail out.

( all screaming )

01:25.917 --> 01:29.542
BLADES:

01:25.917 --> 01:29.542
I already crashed a kite today,

01:25.917 --> 01:29.542
so be careful.

01:29.583 --> 01:32.792
Just maintain your speed.

01:34.125 --> 01:35.709
( grunts )

01:37.083 --> 01:38.834
I'm in.

01:45.959 --> 01:48.208
Ugh, nice save.

Unh, not over yet.

01:51.750 --> 01:54.041
( grunting )

01:54.083 --> 01:56.125
Somebody tell Doc

01:54.083 --> 01:56.125

Doc, are you hurt?

I'm fine.

03:21.208 --> 03:23.166
Thanks to the new

03:21.208 --> 03:23.166
Collision Foam Cannon

03:23.208 --> 03:26.166
that Boulder and I

03:23.208 --> 03:26.166
collaborated on.

03:26.208 --> 03:28.750
Quick thinking, Doc.

03:28.792 --> 03:30.709
That foam

03:28.792 --> 03:30.709
put the fire out too.

03:30.750 --> 03:32.625
Not a benefit we intended.

03:32.667 --> 03:35.125
We're smarter

03:32.667 --> 03:35.125
than we thought.

03:35.166 --> 03:38.166
You can release

03:35.166 --> 03:38.166
the plane now, Doc.

03:43.500 --> 03:47.333
I wonder what caused

03:43.500 --> 03:47.333
the engine to catch fire.

03:47.375 --> 03:49.583
The way the controls froze,

03:49.625 --> 03:51.542
I'd say it was

03:49.625 --> 03:51.542
an electrical short.

03:51.583 --> 03:54.208
Real question is,

03:51.583 --> 03:54.208
what made the plane turn back

03:54.250 --> 03:56.291
toward the island

03:54.250 --> 03:56.291
after Taylor ditched it?

03:56.333 --> 03:58.125
Suppose it could've been

03:56.333 --> 03:58.125
gremlins?

03:58.166 --> 04:00.083
( gasps )

04:00.125 --> 04:02.250
Oh, right.

04:00.125 --> 04:02.250
Gremlins.

04:02.291 --> 04:03.917
( both laughing )

04:03.959 --> 04:05.667
( laughs )

04:05.709 --> 04:07.667
What are gremlins?

04:09.959 --> 04:12.208
Here. "A gremlin

04:09.959 --> 04:12.208
is a mischievous creature

04:12.250 --> 04:14.834
that disables machinery

04:12.250 --> 04:14.834
and electronics."

04:14.875 --> 04:18.500
The very nerve.

04:14.875 --> 04:18.500
What does a gremlin look like?

04:18.542 --> 04:20.083
( Blades gasps )

04:20.125 --> 04:23.667
Those things get into machines?.

04:20.125 --> 04:23.667
Well...

04:23.709 --> 04:25.667
That would explain

04:23.709 --> 04:25.667
the many mechanical maladies

04:25.709 --> 04:27.208
that seem

04:25.709 --> 04:27.208
to plague this island.

04:27.250 --> 04:29.375
Runaway lawn mowers,

04:27.250 --> 04:29.375
for instance.

04:29.417 --> 04:30.625

04:30.667 --> 04:32.917
And Mr. Harrison's

04:30.667 --> 04:32.917
malfunctioning heli-pack.

04:32.959 --> 04:35.333
And how about my problems

04:32.959 --> 04:35.333
flying at high altitudes.

04:35.375 --> 04:37.875
That would be your fear

04:35.375 --> 04:37.875
of heights, Blades.

04:37.917 --> 04:40.542
Nope. Gremlins.

04:40.583 --> 04:43.375
Says here,

04:40.583 --> 04:43.375
"Gremlins are just myths

for something to blame

when things go wrong."

04:45.500 --> 04:48.500
Now that I believe.

04:48.542 --> 04:50.834
You know what else

night shift, buddy.

05:26.667 --> 05:29.125
Didn't you just work

05:26.667 --> 05:29.125
the night shift?

05:29.166 --> 05:30.875
Nice of you to keep track.

05:30.917 --> 05:32.208
I heard you call out

05:32.250 --> 05:33.625
like you were having

a nightmare.

05:33.667 --> 05:35.250
Cody, just go back to bed.

05:35.291 --> 05:37.333
Maybe you should talk

05:35.291 --> 05:37.333
to Doc Greene.

05:37.375 --> 05:38.917
He used to have

05:37.375 --> 05:38.917
nightmares too,

05:38.959 --> 05:41.125
until he came up with a way

05:38.959 --> 05:41.125
to get rid of them.

05:41.166 --> 05:44.667
Well, good for him.

05:41.166 --> 05:44.667
But I can handle a bad dream.

Why don't you just go back--

Uh, thought you might

need some help.

Ugh. All right.

Buckle up.

( siren blaring )

06:41.000 --> 06:44.041
Looks like it might fall over.

Maybe we should call the team.

06:44.083 --> 06:46.875
Nah, the anchor bolts

06:44.083 --> 06:46.875
just need tightening.

Heatwave, brace the tower,

I want to.

08:20.083 --> 08:22.709
I'll go see Doc

in the morning.

08:27.041 --> 08:29.875
Morning, Cody.

08:27.041 --> 08:29.875
Where are you off to so early?

08:29.917 --> 08:32.417
Oh, uh, over to Frankie's.

08:32.458 --> 08:36.125
Kade mentioned he and Heatwave

08:32.458 --> 08:36.125
were going to the Lab too.

08:36.166 --> 08:39.250
Father's intuition

08:36.166 --> 08:39.250
is telling me something is up.

08:39.291 --> 08:42.583
Sibling intuition too.

08:42.625 --> 08:46.041
And Rescue Bots' intuition.

08:42.625 --> 08:46.041
I think.

08:46.083 --> 08:48.083
Remind me to look up

08:46.083 --> 08:48.083
"intuition."

08:48.125 --> 08:51.250
Uh, Kade didn't want me

08:48.125 --> 08:51.250
saying anything,

08:51.291 --> 08:53.792
especially

08:51.291 --> 08:53.792
to Graham and Dani.

08:54.792 --> 08:56.291
Let's hear it.

08:56.333 --> 08:57.792
( sighs )

08:57.834 --> 09:00.041
He's been having bad dreams

08:57.834 --> 09:00.041
about gremlins.

09:00.083 --> 09:02.750
Doc's gonna help him.

09:00.083 --> 09:02.750
Oops.

09:02.792 --> 09:05.625
This is probably our fault.

09:02.792 --> 09:05.625
Probably?

09:05.667 --> 09:06.875
What happened?

09:06.917 --> 09:08.417
When we were little,

09:06.917 --> 09:08.417
Dani and I

09:08.458 --> 09:10.041
would tell Kade

09:08.458 --> 09:10.041
scary gremlin stories

09:10.083 --> 09:12.625
because he was always

09:10.083 --> 09:12.625
bossing us around.

09:12.667 --> 09:15.166
It kind of gave him

09:12.667 --> 09:15.166
nightmares.

09:15.208 --> 09:17.792
But if gremlins aren't real,

09:17.834 --> 09:19.625
why would Kade

09:17.834 --> 09:19.625
be afraid of them?

09:19.667 --> 09:22.125
Because everything feels real

09:19.667 --> 09:22.125
in a nightmare.

09:22.166 --> 09:24.500
It's like having

09:22.166 --> 09:24.500
your worst fears come to life.

09:24.542 --> 09:27.500
Then my nightmare

09:24.542 --> 09:27.500
would undoubtedly contain

09:27.542 --> 09:33.000
a town where no one broke

09:27.542 --> 09:33.000
the law, rendering me useless.

09:33.041 --> 09:36.125
Mine would be

09:33.041 --> 09:36.125
cumulous clouds.

09:36.166 --> 09:40.500
Seriously, they're nature's

09:36.166 --> 09:40.500
Shape-Shifters.

09:40.542 --> 09:42.250
Dani, Graham?

09:42.291 --> 09:46.291
For your sakes,

09:42.291 --> 09:46.291
Doc better be able to help Kade.

09:46.333 --> 09:50.208
Well, Kade, in most cases,

09:46.333 --> 09:50.208
nightmares abate over time.

09:50.250 --> 09:53.208
But I've invented a way

09:50.250 --> 09:53.208
to speed up the process.

09:53.250 --> 09:55.959
The Nightmare Imaging Device.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.834
You lie inside this soundproofed

09:56.000 --> 09:58.834
sleep chamber,

09:58.875 --> 10:03.166
wear the Neural Impulse Helmet,

09:58.875 --> 10:03.166
then fall asleep.

10:03.208 --> 10:05.458
Once you begin dreaming

10:03.208 --> 10:05.458
about gremlins,

10:05.500 --> 10:09.000
they will be recreated

10:05.500 --> 10:09.000
inside this Energy Chamber

10:09.041 --> 10:10.667
exactly how you imagine them.

10:10.709 --> 10:13.709
What do you mean, like for real?

10:10.709 --> 10:13.709
They'll look real,

10:13.750 --> 10:16.083
but they'll only be made

10:13.750 --> 10:16.083
of energy and crystal particles.

10:16.125 --> 10:18.000
Like a hologram that's solid.

10:18.041 --> 10:21.250
The Gremlin could be made of

10:18.041 --> 10:21.250
pudding and I'd have nightmares.

10:21.291 --> 10:25.125
But once you wake up and face

10:21.291 --> 10:25.125
your fears in the light of day,

10:25.166 --> 10:28.083
you'll see they're not nearly

10:25.166 --> 10:28.083
as frightening as you imagined.

10:28.125 --> 10:31.375
Then we shut the machine off

10:28.125 --> 10:31.375
and the Gremlins disappear.

10:31.417 --> 10:35.375
And chances are,

10:31.417 --> 10:35.375
so will your nightmares.

10:37.375 --> 10:42.792
Okay, Doc, if this gadget will

10:37.375 --> 10:42.792
get rid of my gremlins, I'm in.

10:44.917 --> 10:49.291
Neural Impulse Helmet secured,

10:44.917 --> 10:49.291
power on.

10:51.125 --> 10:54.709
Now, Kade, simply let yourself

10:51.125 --> 10:54.709
fall asleep and...

10:54.750 --> 10:56.000
( Doc snores )

10:57.875 --> 10:59.166
All right, then.

11:01.583 --> 11:03.959
Doc, I want your word

11:01.583 --> 11:03.959
this isn't gonna hurt him.

11:04.000 --> 11:08.083
He won't feel a thing,

11:04.000 --> 11:08.083
Heatwave, I promise.

11:09.917 --> 11:11.917
(  dramatic theme playing  )

11:31.583 --> 11:34.875
Whoa, Kade dreams of those?

11:34.917 --> 11:36.792
No wonder he can't sleep.

11:36.834 --> 11:38.917

Feisty little figments,

11:41.667 --> 11:45.083
aren't they?

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
( gremlins laughing )

11:53.166 --> 11:54.792
Is this supposed

11:53.166 --> 11:54.792
to happen?

11:54.834 --> 11:56.792
I don't think so. Dad?

11:56.834 --> 11:59.625
Uh, no need to panic.

11:59.667 --> 12:01.458
( growling )

12:01.500 --> 12:03.583
DOC:

12:01.500 --> 12:03.583
The crystal particles

12:01.500 --> 12:03.583
these Gremlins are made of

12:03.625 --> 12:05.709
contain only a limited amount

12:03.625 --> 12:05.709
of energy.

( gremlins laughing

12:05.750 --> 12:07.667

12:13.166 --> 12:16.959
Once that energy is used up,

12:13.166 --> 12:16.959
the Gremlins will vanish.

12:22.875 --> 12:25.834
I'm waking Kade before he dreams

12:22.875 --> 12:25.834
up any more of those things.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.750
Nap-time's over.

( gasps ):

12:34.542 --> 12:35.959
Gremlins!

12:36.000 --> 12:37.542
I was dreaming about

12:36.000 --> 12:37.542
lots and lots of--

12:37.583 --> 12:40.166
We know.

12:37.583 --> 12:40.166

Aah! Why aren't the Gremlins

12:50.333 --> 12:54.291
disappearing?

12:54.333 --> 12:56.834
Yeah. Shouldn't they be running

12:54.333 --> 12:56.834
out of energy by now?

12:56.875 --> 12:58.875
( electricity crackling )

13:04.792 --> 13:06.500
Intriguing.

13:06.542 --> 13:08.667
The Gremlins

13:06.542 --> 13:08.667
are recharging themselves

13:08.709 --> 13:12.208
by siphoning electricity through

13:27.291 --> 13:31.333
Whew. The little scamps

13:27.291 --> 13:31.333
have blown the breaker box.

13:31.375 --> 13:33.667
Now they'll be vanishing

Unh! The Gremlins

are now drawing power

So maybe I am cured.

14:37.166 --> 14:39.458
They fried everything.

At least it's over.

Did Kade

put you up to this?

No.

And kind of cute.

15:37.333 --> 15:40.834
They are real. I knew it.

They're manifestations

of Kade's nightmares

15:43.041 --> 15:44.792
of crystal particles.

15:44.834 --> 15:46.333
They only look real.

20:42.625 --> 20:47.333
Now feel like tackling

20:42.625 --> 20:47.333
some shape-shifting clouds next?

20:47.375 --> 20:49.333
I'll have to run a diagnostic,

20:49.375 --> 20:52.458
but it looks like the power grid

20:49.375 --> 20:52.458
didn't sustain any damage.

20:52.500 --> 20:56.041
Hey, squirt, tell Doc to deliver

20:52.500 --> 20:56.041
his Nightmare Imaging Debacle

20:56.083 --> 20:58.417
straight to

20:56.083 --> 20:58.417
the Best Left Forgotten section.

20:58.458 --> 21:01.458
Definitely.

20:58.458 --> 21:01.458
Take a few days off, son.

21:01.500 --> 21:02.709
Get some rest.

21:02.750 --> 21:05.083
Kade, Dani and I...

21:05.125 --> 21:07.709
We're really sorry

21:05.125 --> 21:07.709
for teasing you.

21:07.750 --> 21:10.709
Don't worry about it, sis.

21:07.750 --> 21:10.709
They're gone now.

21:10.750 --> 21:14.333
Every drooling, big-eyed,

21:10.750 --> 21:14.333
disgusting,

21:14.375 --> 21:16.667
slimy, scary one of them.

21:16.709 --> 21:18.500
Pleasant dreams.

21:23.250 --> 21:25.250
( snoring lightly )

21:27.750 --> 21:29.375
BOTH (in unison):

21:27.750 --> 21:29.375
Gremlins!

21:30.500 --> 21:32.834
(  dramatic theme playing  )
