00:01.418 --> 00:03.284
Previously on "Designated Survivor”...

00:03.420 --> 00:05.286
Why do you think
| need a political director?

00:05.422 --> 00:07.459
-Currently the polls say--
- I don't care about the polls.

00:07.591 --> 00:08.797
You should, sir.

00:08.926 --> 00:10.963
Lyor is here because
we need a direction,

00:11.094 --> 00:12.596
someone to help
with our messaging,

00:12.721 --> 00:13.882
and there is no one better.

00:14.014 --> 00:15.470
[Hannah] Our target is Patrick Lloyd.

00:15.599 --> 00:18.591
We believe that he is responsible
for the bombing on our Capitol.

00:18.727 --> 00:21.310
Can you update the status
of the Lloyd investigation?

00:21.438 --> 00:22.769
All our best people are on it.

00:22.898 --> 00:24.980
-How long have you been on Lloyd's trail?
-Months.

00:25.108 --> 00:27.315
But I'm surprised to find
British Intelligence on this.

00:27.444 --> 00:30.277
[Damian] Lloyd knows we're getting
closer. He's covering his tracks.

00:32.281 --> 00:33.738
He's got a bunch of passports here--

00:33.867 --> 00:35.153
He's got about a dozen tickets,

00:35.285 --> 00:37.868
all for this morning,
all for different airports.

00:41.542 --> 00:43.124
[car engine starts]

00:43.252 --> 00:45.368
[indistinct conversations]

00:46.630 --> 00:47.961
[woman] Okay, I'll be right there.

00:48.090 --> 00:49.205
[device beeps]

00:51.385 --> 00:52.625
[car alarm chirps]

00:55.138 --> 00:56.720
[engine starts]

01:02.312 --> 01:03.518
[Chuck] We just found this.

01:03.647 --> 01:07.185
It's from a BWI surveillance video,
10:43 last night, international arrivals.

01:07.317 --> 01:09.103
You can't make out a face.

01:09.236 --> 01:11.853
No, but you can make out an ear.

01:11.989 --> 01:14.276
[keyboard clacking]

01:14.408 --> 01:16.945
Biometrically, ears are
as identifiable as fingerprints.

01:17.077 --> 01:20.240
[keyboard clacking,
computer beeping]

01:26.169 --> 01:27.785
Bingo. That's our guy.

01:27.921 --> 01:30.208
-Impressive.
-Well, I have a degree in criminology.

01:30.340 --> 01:31.626
That's good, Chuck. Thanks.

01:33.135 --> 01:35.877
Six months on the move, he's got
to be running out of options.

01:36.013 --> 01:37.549
Why would he go back
to the scene of the crime?

01:37.681 --> 01:40.048
There's something he wants here.
But he's exposed,

01:40.183 --> 01:42.140
and all alone.
You've arrested his confederates.

01:42.269 --> 01:44.806
-What about family?
-Divorced. Doesn't speak to his ex.

01:44.938 --> 01:46.554
He does have an estranged son
in Reston,

01:46.690 --> 01:48.556
but he hasn't spoken to him
in 10 years.

01:48.692 --> 01:51.229
Blood's still blood, and it sounds
like he's got nowhere else to go.

01:51.361 --> 01:52.817
All right, I'll...

01:53.655 --> 01:54.736
We'll check it out.

01:54.865 --> 01:56.697
-[cellphone rings]
-Aaron Shore.

01:57.784 --> 01:59.741
Tell the President I'm on my way.

01:59.870 --> 02:01.907
Mr. President, you promised
the public transparency.

02:02.039 --> 02:03.655
Yes, but what's
he going to say, Emily?

02:03.790 --> 02:06.168
"My fellow Americans, Patrick Lloyd
is back. Run for your lives"?

02:06.293 --> 02:09.251
No, he's gonna say, "pursuant
to my promise of transparency"--

02:09.378 --> 02:12.246
Aaron, how badly will we compromise
the investigation if we go public?

02:12.382 --> 02:15.420
Completely, sir.
Lloyd returned to D.C. for a reason,

02:15.552 --> 02:17.259
but he'll disappear
if he knows we're hunting him.

02:17.387 --> 02:19.879
Then there are the practical concerns
of tipping him.

02:20.015 --> 02:21.050
Which are?

02:21.183 --> 02:24.266
He's an unpredictable adversary
with unlimited resources.

02:24.394 --> 02:26.431
Meaning he could have
a dirty bomb, a tactical nuke.

02:26.563 --> 02:27.769
And once we locate him,

02:27.898 --> 02:29.764
we'll have to remove him
from the population center

02:29.900 --> 02:32.392
before we bring him down.
So the pursuit has to stay covert.

02:32.527 --> 02:34.689
What kind of manpower are we
talking about to accomplish this?

02:34.821 --> 02:38.064
About 200 agents would constitute
a minimum effective deployment.

02:38.200 --> 02:40.282
He's got a 10-hour lead,
but we have NSA satellites

02:40.410 --> 02:42.242
sweeping through
every Browning-Reed facility,

02:42.371 --> 02:43.532
any place he's ever frequented.

02:43.664 --> 02:46.156
As long as he stays above ground,
we will acquire him.

02:48.919 --> 02:51.286
Em, you're right, I made a promise
regarding transparency,

02:51.421 --> 02:53.287
but I made a bigger promise
to the American people,

02:53.423 --> 02:56.461
and that's to keep them safe.
So for now, we keep a lid on this.

02:56.593 --> 02:57.458
Congress has to know.

02:57.594 --> 03:00.302
Yes. I agree. If this goes wrong
and you kept them in the dark,

03:00.430 --> 03:02.296
you'll get slaughtered, sir.
You need cover.

03:02.432 --> 03:03.593
[chuckles]

03:03.725 --> 03:05.102
We'll inform HSC.

03:05.227 --> 03:06.467
Not because I need cover,

03:06.603 --> 03:08.560
but because this is not
a government of one.

03:08.689 --> 03:09.804
Thank you.

03:09.940 --> 03:10.930
[indistinct conversations]

03:11.066 --> 03:13.273
-[Lyor] So, you've read Seth's jokes?
-[Emily] Not yet.

03:13.402 --> 03:16.940
-You are gonna read them, though, right?
-Yes. Why are you so worried about this?

03:17.072 --> 03:18.733
Because tonight's
the Correspondents' Dinner,

03:18.865 --> 03:21.983
and the centerpiece is the President's
monologue, and Seth is not funny.

03:22.119 --> 03:23.609
Seth's funny.

03:25.706 --> 03:26.616
[Seth] So?

03:26.873 --> 03:27.954
These aren't funny.

03:29.626 --> 03:31.993
-You're not the arbiter of funny.
-I am the arbiter of funny.

03:32.129 --> 03:34.791
-I was in "Hasty Pudding."”
-A theatrical troupe, guys in drag.

03:34.923 --> 03:36.254
Yeah. See? That's funny.

03:36.383 --> 03:38.090
[scoffs] That's not funny.

03:38.218 --> 03:39.754
I'm funny!

03:40.137 --> 03:41.252
[door closes]

03:42.139 --> 03:43.379
[door opens]

03:43.640 --> 03:45.506
Senator Feller,
Senator Cowling.

03:45.642 --> 03:48.430
| just wanted to step in and thank you
very much for coming by.

03:48.562 --> 03:49.802
Our pleasure, Mr. President.

03:49.938 --> 03:51.645
Our committee counsel Kendra Daynes.

03:51.773 --> 03:54.435
She helps us navigate Homeland Security's
regulatory scheme.

03:54.568 --> 03:57.185
Ms. Daynes, I think you might need
a few more lawyers.

03:57.320 --> 03:58.355
Yes, sir.

03:58.488 --> 04:01.401
I'll let Emily and Aaron walk you
through it. Again, welcome.

04:04.119 --> 04:05.860
[Aaron] Our most up-to-date Lloyd intel.

04:05.996 --> 04:07.703
Yes. Emily sent us the preview.

04:07.831 --> 04:10.664
Now, I understand you don't want
to share this with the public?

04:10.792 --> 04:12.169
No, Senator, we do not.

04:12.294 --> 04:14.535
We believe that would hinder
our investigation.

04:14.671 --> 04:16.708
-I respect that position.
-I don't.

04:16.839 --> 04:18.797
I'm from Missouri, the "Show Me" state.

04:18.925 --> 04:21.791
If there's a lunatic out there,
my constituents should be apprised.

04:21.928 --> 04:24.215
Senator, Patrick Lloyd
is a long way from Missouri.

04:24.347 --> 04:25.678
Well, today...
What about tomorrow?

04:25.807 --> 04:27.718
-[Emily] The President believes that--
-I'm sorry. The President

04:27.851 --> 04:30.058
-has already classified this intel?
-Yes.

04:30.187 --> 04:32.474
| thought the Committee was brought in
for advice and consent.

04:32.606 --> 04:34.973
-If he's already decided--
-This meeting's a formality.

04:35.108 --> 04:37.065
We prefer to think of it
as a courtesy, Senator.

04:37.194 --> 04:39.982
| think of it as executive overreach.
See, there's a difference

04:40.113 --> 04:42.571
between being consulted with
and dictated to.

04:42.699 --> 04:45.532
This is the latter.
Thanks for the briefing.

04:47.287 --> 04:48.277
[door opens, closes]

04:49.706 --> 04:51.208
[Travis] Like I told you guys last time,

04:51.333 --> 04:52.949
| haven't seen my dad in a decade.

04:53.710 --> 04:55.417
And he hasn't tried to contact you.

04:55.545 --> 04:57.161
No. Why would he?

04:57.297 --> 04:59.664
He knows what I think about him,
even before he went crazy.

04:59.800 --> 05:01.916
And you can't think of anyone else
he would reach out to.

05:02.052 --> 05:02.883
No.

05:04.387 --> 05:06.549
Look, I-I don't know him, okay?

05:07.182 --> 05:09.549
| don't want anything from him.
| wouldn't even take his money.

05:10.727 --> 05:13.970
What money?
We didn't ask you about money.

05:15.565 --> 05:17.306
No, I'm saying I wouldn't take it...

05:18.193 --> 05:19.854
...like, if he offered it, you know?

05:19.986 --> 05:23.570
Travis, we have a dossier on you.

05:24.366 --> 05:26.232
Now, we know you're not helping him.

05:26.368 --> 05:29.952
The only way you get into trouble
is if you hide stuff from us.

05:30.080 --> 05:31.570
Then you're an accomplice.

05:38.088 --> 05:39.294
[exhales sharply]

05:39.422 --> 05:42.460
The son of bitch came by this morning
for 30 seconds.

05:42.592 --> 05:44.458
-[cellphone beeps]
-Yeah, we got a sighting in Rockuville.

05:44.594 --> 05:46.926
[indistinct conversations]

05:51.017 --> 05:54.260
We got two cars in front, two following.
Three at every exit

05:54.396 --> 05:56.888
between his present location
and Annapolis. They're all unmarked.

05:57.023 --> 05:58.309
[Aaron] And we're tracking him
with satcom,

05:58.441 --> 06:00.057
so he should be completely unaware.

06:00.193 --> 06:01.604
How did you
get on his trail so quickly?

06:01.736 --> 06:03.647
We ran the license
you pulled from that security cam

06:03.780 --> 06:06.112
at his kid's development.
Lloyd's in an HOV lane.

06:06.241 --> 06:08.983
No EZ-Pass, so he hits a check point,
MDTA snaps a picture.

06:09.119 --> 06:10.609
That's not smart.

06:13.790 --> 06:16.498
-Get rid of the two lead cars.
-If we do that, he'll accelerate.

06:16.626 --> 06:19.664
We'll follow at pace. The game's gonna be
over. Montgomery County's still too close

06:19.796 --> 06:21.082
-to a population center.
-John...

06:22.215 --> 06:24.047
Trust me.

06:26.136 --> 06:28.594
Units 9, 10, disengage.

06:31.308 --> 06:33.800
[computer beeping]

06:34.436 --> 06:37.519
-He's not picking up the pace.
-Because it's not him.

06:37.647 --> 06:38.682
We don't know that.

06:38.815 --> 06:41.432
| tracked this guy
for six months all over Europe

06:41.568 --> 06:43.275
with every single resource
at my disposal,

06:43.403 --> 06:45.269
and I never even got close.

06:45.405 --> 06:47.112
He is so clever.

06:47.240 --> 06:49.527
Why would he steal a car from
a parking lot with surveillance video

06:49.659 --> 06:52.151
and then hop into an EZ-Pass lane
where he can be tracked?

06:52.287 --> 06:55.075
And drive exactly the speed limit
so he'd be easy to follow.

06:56.458 --> 06:57.823
Not him.

06:58.501 --> 07:00.629
[theme music]

07:10.305 --> 07:12.342
So, the President's gonna be sending
his student loan initiative

07:12.474 --> 07:14.056
to the committee later in the week.

07:14.184 --> 07:16.300
I'll have more info for you
as things develop. Okay, Brian?

07:17.687 --> 07:19.553
Um, hey, one quick item...

07:19.689 --> 07:22.727
| know there's rampant speculation
that Larry David

07:22.859 --> 07:25.226
has been ghostwriting
the President's jokes, uh, for tonight.

07:25.362 --> 07:27.353
Um, let me just dispel that rumor.

07:27.489 --> 07:28.524
Uh...

07:29.324 --> 07:30.906
Larry David is, uh,

07:31.034 --> 07:33.150
actually handcuffed in a trunk
under my bed.

07:33.286 --> 07:35.197
[laughs]

07:37.666 --> 07:38.872
Uh, anything else?

07:40.001 --> 07:40.911
Yeah. Shelley.

07:41.044 --> 07:43.911
A source says Senator Feller
just had a secret Saturday meeting here

07:44.047 --> 07:47.039
to reverse a base closure in his state.
Care to comment?

07:47.175 --> 07:49.382
-Well, I mean, that didn't happen.
-So, that's a denial?

07:49.511 --> 07:51.252
-Categorical.
-So, Senator Feller wasn't

07:51.388 --> 07:52.253
in the White House today?

07:52.389 --> 07:54.096
Lots of people were
in the White House today.

07:54.224 --> 07:55.760
-Come on, Seth.
-Seth?

07:55.892 --> 07:57.257
Yes. Tiffany.

07:57.394 --> 08:00.728
Is the First Lady going to be wearing
Zac Posen tonight?

08:01.523 --> 08:02.684
Yes. Right.

08:02.816 --> 08:04.853
Uh... well, let me start
with the President.

08:04.985 --> 08:06.896
The President's gonna be
wearing Burberry...

08:07.028 --> 08:08.564
[keyboard clacking]

08:14.828 --> 08:15.863
Wow!

08:15.996 --> 08:17.907
Mom, you look beautiful.

08:19.499 --> 08:20.785
Really?

08:20.917 --> 08:23.784
You know what I think? I think
| look like a high-class call girl.

08:23.920 --> 08:26.457
What? Mom! Come on, you've been
living in Paris the last year.

08:26.589 --> 08:27.795
This is haute couture.

08:27.924 --> 08:29.631
Yeah, but I was never
interested in that stuff.

08:29.759 --> 08:31.136
| was there learning how to draw.

08:31.261 --> 08:33.798
Vivianna has a trunk-load of stuff
if you don't like this one.

08:33.929 --> 08:34.794
[Tom] Wow.

08:34.931 --> 08:36.922
Can I buy you a drink?

08:38.518 --> 08:39.474
See?

08:39.602 --> 08:42.059
I'm joking. I heard you both talking
as I was walking in.

08:42.188 --> 08:44.179
Eva, you look beautiful.

08:45.734 --> 08:47.475
Well, you are a charmer,
Tom Kirkman.

08:47.610 --> 08:48.941
But this is my third event.

08:49.070 --> 08:50.231
You must know by now

08:50.363 --> 08:52.274
how I feel about letting
someone else clothe me.

08:52.407 --> 08:55.240
I'm just not comfortable with it.
It's not me. No. I'm not doing it.

08:55.368 --> 08:56.233
I'm gonna go home,

08:56.369 --> 08:57.825
and I'm gonna get
my own dress.

08:57.954 --> 08:59.456
Okay. That's all right.
Mike will take you.

08:59.581 --> 09:01.492
Give me a minute
to get out of this.

09:01.624 --> 09:02.785
-Of course, ma'am.
-[door closes]

09:02.917 --> 09:06.160
Don't let her make you
take Connecticut this time.

09:06.296 --> 09:08.833
Sir, do you want to tell her
how we should go?

09:08.965 --> 09:10.831
[scoffs] Good point.

09:10.967 --> 09:13.959
So, the designer thing
didn't work out. You were right.

09:14.095 --> 09:15.426
-[phone rings]
-I'm paid to be right.

09:15.555 --> 09:16.636
Mm-hmm.

09:17.223 --> 09:18.213
Yeah?

09:19.893 --> 09:22.305
No, I want to see Senator Feller now.

09:22.729 --> 09:23.810
Senator.

09:23.938 --> 09:25.349
-Mr. President.
-Please sit.

09:25.482 --> 09:26.688
Thank you for coming back.

09:26.816 --> 09:29.524
| wanted to talk to you privately
to see if we could straighten out

09:29.652 --> 09:31.518
-a misunderstanding.
-I'll do my best.

09:31.654 --> 09:34.316
Did you leak information
to the press about today's meeting?

09:35.075 --> 09:35.940
Sir?

09:36.076 --> 09:37.612
Because it was
a national security briefing.

09:37.744 --> 09:39.109
That's why the intel's classified.

09:39.245 --> 09:40.280
I'm aware of that, sir.

09:40.413 --> 09:43.531
But you thought it was all right
to use the press to spread a fake story

09:43.666 --> 09:47.079
about the reason for the meeting,
because you knew I couldn't deny it.

09:48.671 --> 09:50.048
[... Mr. President--

09:50.173 --> 09:51.504
So, how's this work?

09:51.633 --> 09:53.874
| don't play ball, you start
leaking classified information?

09:54.010 --> 09:55.717
No, I would never do that.

09:55.845 --> 09:57.631
So this is some sort of shakedown.

09:59.182 --> 10:03.221
This base closure
will cost my state 6,000 jobs.

10:03.353 --> 10:05.060
I've been trying to get
the White House's attention--

10:05.188 --> 10:06.349
Now you've got it.

10:07.357 --> 10:09.724
Patrick Lloyd is the single greatest
threat to our national security.

10:09.859 --> 10:11.691
You don't get to use him
for political gain.

10:11.820 --> 10:14.403
No, sir, I would never
jeopardize national security.

10:14.531 --> 10:17.489
-You can rely on my integrity.
-I'm counting on it.

10:17.951 --> 10:20.818
The base closure will not be revisited.
Goodbye, Senator.

10:30.004 --> 10:31.256
You were right.

10:31.381 --> 10:33.998
They pulled the S.U.V. over,
yanked out some clueless college kid

10:34.134 --> 10:35.716
Lloyd gave $1,000 to

10:35.844 --> 10:37.175
-so he'd drive to Harrisburg.
-[cellphone vibrates]

10:37.303 --> 10:39.010
-He's buying time.
-To do what?

10:39.139 --> 10:40.220
Yeah?

10:41.808 --> 10:43.674
-Okay.
-[cellphone beeps]

10:44.060 --> 10:45.892
Secret Service says
a silent alarm was tripped

10:46.020 --> 10:48.887
at a private residence in Rockuville,
264 Thistlebridge.

10:49.983 --> 10:50.939
Who lives there?

10:51.067 --> 10:52.182
The First Lady's mother.

10:54.863 --> 10:56.479
[glass shatters]

10:58.199 --> 11:00.190
[breathes heavily]

11:04.747 --> 11:06.909
[indistinct conversations,
sirens wail]

11:14.090 --> 11:16.377
[helicopter blades
whir in distance]

11:16.509 --> 11:17.920
[background chatter]

11:20.763 --> 11:21.969
[Hannah] Mrs. Booker,

11:22.098 --> 11:24.089
I'm Special Agent-in-Charge
Hannah Wells.

11:24.225 --> 11:25.556
This is Mr. Rennett
from Scotland Yard.

11:25.685 --> 11:27.767
How are you doing?
Are you okay?

11:27.896 --> 11:30.433
-I think I am, yes.
-Tell us what happened, madam.

11:30.565 --> 11:33.603
Well, I came back, um,
to pick up a dress,

11:33.735 --> 11:35.976
and, um... and I sent Mike away.

11:36.112 --> 11:37.227
-Mike Ritter?
-Yes.

11:37.363 --> 11:38.979
Because |-I was gonna be a while,

11:39.115 --> 11:41.277
and I was napping,
and I heard this noise.

11:41.409 --> 11:43.992
It sounded like somebody
was trying to break in.

11:44.120 --> 11:46.157
But then I heard: boom!

11:46.289 --> 11:48.951
It was like the door
was being kicked down.

11:49.083 --> 11:51.245
And that's when
| hit the panic button

11:51.377 --> 11:52.708
and hid.

11:53.588 --> 11:56.580
It sounded like the place
was being torn apart.

11:57.717 --> 11:59.583
| thought I was gonna die.

12:00.762 --> 12:03.003
Well, you're okay now, Mrs. Booker.

12:03.139 --> 12:04.379
Yeah.

12:04.974 --> 12:06.180
What do they want?

12:06.309 --> 12:07.595
We don't know yet.

12:08.895 --> 12:10.477
-Mrs. Booker.
-Mike! Oh.

12:10.605 --> 12:12.767
Hey, I'm gonna take you back
to the White House now.

12:12.899 --> 12:13.809
Oh, okay.

12:13.942 --> 12:15.683
Oh, |-I need my dress.

12:15.818 --> 12:17.229
I'll have someone
grab it for you.

12:20.156 --> 12:22.272
We're pulling Lloyd's latents
off of everything.

12:22.408 --> 12:25.275
| want every inch of this house combed,
and I want a detailed report

12:25.411 --> 12:27.448
of everything that Lloyd touched,
got it?

12:35.755 --> 12:36.961
My family?

12:37.090 --> 12:39.047
-He's coming after my family?
-We're still trying

12:39.175 --> 12:41.041
-to ascertain his purpose.
-Well, I can tell you that.

12:41.177 --> 12:43.714
He's sending a message that
he can get close to my loved ones.

12:43.846 --> 12:45.507
He's trying to make this personal.

12:46.683 --> 12:48.469
We'll keep you posted.

12:50.603 --> 12:52.389
[door opens, closes]

12:52.522 --> 12:54.229
[sighs]

12:54.357 --> 12:57.065
So, she's resting,
but she won't take a sedative.

12:57.193 --> 12:59.400
Well, if she's fighting the doctor,
that's a good sign.

12:59.529 --> 13:01.486
Tom, what is going on?

13:01.614 --> 13:03.230
| don't know yet,
but we're gonna find him.

13:03.366 --> 13:06.404
-It looks like he's gonna find us first.
-No! No, no.

13:06.536 --> 13:08.652
| promise you. We are safe.

13:11.207 --> 13:13.369
-I'm gonna go check on the kids, okay?
-Yeah.

13:25.513 --> 13:29.097
DMV says there are 658 blue sedans
registered in Montgomery County.

13:29.225 --> 13:31.341
So this list covers
an eight-year production period?

13:31.477 --> 13:32.342
Yep. Narrowed it

13:32.478 --> 13:34.685
as much as I could,
given the parameters.

13:34.814 --> 13:37.101
Which could be worthless if the neighbor
didn't give us accurate details.

13:37.233 --> 13:40.271
Or if the car he gave us details on
wasn't coming from Mrs. Booker's house.

13:40.403 --> 13:42.940
Lloyd had to know breaking
into the home of the First Lady's mother

13:43.072 --> 13:44.528
meant that he was gonna draw attention.

13:44.657 --> 13:46.113
Chuck, where are we on a title search?

13:46.242 --> 13:48.449
[keyboard clacking]

13:48.578 --> 13:50.910
All six properties Lloyd
owned in Montgomery County

13:51.039 --> 13:53.952
-were seized months ago.
-What about Browning-Reed properties?

13:54.083 --> 13:56.199
Only two; also under
government administration.

13:56.336 --> 13:59.124
Well, check joint ventures, wholly
owned subs, predecessor companies.

13:59.255 --> 14:00.086
| already checked.

14:01.174 --> 14:02.130
Wait.

14:02.258 --> 14:03.498
Here's something.

14:03.843 --> 14:06.961
Okay, Browning-Reed purchased
a tract of land about a decade ago,

14:07.096 --> 14:09.133
used it as a dumping ground,
became a Superfund site.

14:09.265 --> 14:10.881
The company didn't
make its penalty payments,

14:11.017 --> 14:14.260
so title defaulted to the City
of Rockville who never took possession.

14:14.395 --> 14:15.806
[Damian] What's it used for now?

14:15.938 --> 14:16.973
[keyboard clacking]

14:17.106 --> 14:18.892
No tax records.

14:19.025 --> 14:20.936
So far as I can tell,
it's abandoned.

14:21.361 --> 14:24.479
It's 1545 Bramble
off Norbeck, near Olney.

14:24.614 --> 14:26.355
[Hannah] That's two miles from here.

14:42.090 --> 14:44.127
[birds chirping]

14:46.928 --> 14:47.963
Blue sedan.

14:55.061 --> 14:57.553
[gunfire]

15:03.611 --> 15:04.476
You okay?

15:04.612 --> 15:05.852
Yeah. Yeah.

15:05.988 --> 15:07.365
It's a n... it's just a nick!

15:07.490 --> 15:08.571
Hannah, I'm good!

15:11.786 --> 15:13.322
[panting]

15:14.956 --> 15:16.663
[grunts]

15:21.921 --> 15:24.003
[grunts]

15:29.929 --> 15:31.966
[panting]

15:34.016 --> 15:36.724
His compound's got a dedicated T1 line;
we've cut it,

15:36.853 --> 15:38.685
meaning he's got
no Internet access.

15:38.813 --> 15:40.895
He tries to communicate
with the outside world,

15:41.023 --> 15:43.014
he's routed straight to us
on a secure connection.

15:43.151 --> 15:44.312
Show me what he posted.

15:47.280 --> 15:49.066
[Lloyd] This is a message
for the President.

15:49.198 --> 15:52.736
| possess
1,000 kilograms of sarin gas.

15:52.869 --> 15:55.827
| also possess
the means to disperse that gas

15:55.955 --> 15:59.414
throughout the entire
Washington metropolitan area,

15:59.542 --> 16:02.204
which I am prepared to do
if my demand is not met.

16:03.296 --> 16:05.879
At 20:00, the President
will deliver a monologue

16:06.007 --> 16:07.372
to a nationally televised audience -

16:07.508 --> 16:09.749
comments which underscore
the mockery

16:09.886 --> 16:12.594
that this government has made
of our great nation.

16:12.722 --> 16:15.339
Instead, he will use this occasion

16:15.475 --> 16:18.718
to grant me unconditional amnesty.

16:18.853 --> 16:22.596
If this demand is not met,
thousands will die.

16:22.732 --> 16:24.689
This will be
my only communication.

16:24.817 --> 16:26.023
[computer beeps]

16:26.152 --> 16:29.110
He can't seriously think
you're going to pardon him.

16:29.238 --> 16:30.945
General, he's not looking
for a pardon.

16:31.073 --> 16:33.110
-He's looking for a showdown.
-[Foerstel] Mr. President,

16:33.242 --> 16:35.028
Lloyd has the history
and the resources to suggest

16:35.161 --> 16:37.072
-that we should take the threat seriously.
-[Tom] I am.

16:37.205 --> 16:38.866
Should we be considering
an evacuation?

16:38.998 --> 16:41.410
Not practical. We have two hours.

16:42.084 --> 16:44.576
We have no idea of the range
of any of the missiles

16:44.712 --> 16:46.043
that he might have in there,

16:46.172 --> 16:48.254
so we couldn't define
a geographical area.

16:50.593 --> 16:52.209
Tell me what you know about the bunker.

16:52.345 --> 16:54.427
He had it ready and waiting
before he fled to Europe.

16:54.555 --> 16:57.638
If everything didn't work out, he could
use it as the site of his last stand.

16:57.767 --> 16:59.883
Imaging puts the walls
at at least 18 feet thick;

17:00.019 --> 17:02.306
solid concrete means that
we can't scan the interior.

17:02.438 --> 17:05.146
It's also sturdy enough
to withstand conventional explosives.

17:05.273 --> 17:07.140
We could wire the bunker
with high-grade munitions.

17:07.276 --> 17:08.561
That would take hours.

17:08.694 --> 17:10.310
The perimeter is lined with cameras.

17:10.445 --> 17:12.403
-He'd see us coming.
-And act accordingly.

17:12.531 --> 17:13.943
But Director Foerstel's correct

17:14.075 --> 17:15.736
about the type of ordnance
that we would need.

17:15.867 --> 17:17.825
We not only have to breach the bunker,

17:17.954 --> 17:20.742
sarin has to be incinerated
at a temperature high enough

17:20.873 --> 17:23.160
to neutralize biological compounds.

17:23.291 --> 17:25.249
Well, there are a finite
number of ways to deliver

17:25.377 --> 17:28.461
-that sort of payload on a target quickly.
-An aerial drop being the best option.

17:28.589 --> 17:30.455
-A bomb?
-Bunker buster.

17:30.591 --> 17:32.298
| guarantee that
it'll neutralize the threat.

17:32.426 --> 17:33.257
An F-167

17:33.386 --> 17:36.469
General, the idea's to avoid panic,
not precipitate it.

17:39.308 --> 17:40.173
[exhales]

17:40.309 --> 17:41.765
Wait. What about a drone?

17:43.145 --> 17:46.354
It's covert, it could get close enough
to its target so the public won't see.

17:46.482 --> 17:47.847
Could work...

17:47.984 --> 17:50.351
if we use the right type
of nitrogen-based explosives.

17:50.486 --> 17:53.274
Sir, military action
against a civilian target

17:53.406 --> 17:56.194
is unprecedented in this country,
and it may not be lawful.

17:56.325 --> 17:58.362
Or necessary
if this maniac is bluffing.

17:58.494 --> 17:59.859
If Lloyd is dead,
he takes the secret

17:59.996 --> 18:02.863
of whatever he's been working on
for the past six months to the grave.

18:02.999 --> 18:05.957
So you're saying we should be doing
everything we can to take him alive.

18:06.669 --> 18:09.377
We need to know what's inside that
bunker. We've got less than two hours.

18:09.505 --> 18:12.463
We'll get you a rapid threat assessment
on the likelihood he has sarin gas, sir.

18:12.592 --> 18:13.548
[exhales]

18:13.676 --> 18:16.213
How is it possible that the most
powerful country in the world

18:16.345 --> 18:20.509
finally has its monster cornered,
and he's holding all the cards?

18:26.939 --> 18:29.727
15 minutes, a couple photo ops,
and then I need to get back.

18:29.859 --> 18:32.317
Uh, respectfully, sir, you need
to stay for the duration.

18:32.445 --> 18:33.731
Apparently, you didn't get the memo,

18:33.863 --> 18:36.230
but Patrick Lloyd - the most-wanted man
on the planet -

18:36.365 --> 18:38.823
is threatening to kill a few thousand
people in the next couple hours.

18:38.951 --> 18:41.659
Yes, well, this is why you have
to maintain a veneer of normalcy.

18:41.787 --> 18:43.243
You know, George Washington,

18:43.372 --> 18:45.488
he hosted a ball
during the Battle of Saratoga.

18:45.625 --> 18:49.368
-The redcoats didn't have nerve gas.
-I have to agree with Lyor, Mr. President.

18:49.503 --> 18:52.245
You have to keep up appearances,
or people will know there's a crisis.

18:52.381 --> 18:54.247
And we've set up
a fully functional war room

18:54.383 --> 18:56.420
SO you can monitor the situation
in real time, sir.

18:56.552 --> 18:59.544
Meanwhile, you... you crack wise.

18:59.680 --> 19:01.762
-He will be cracking wise, right, Seth?
-[Seth] Absolutely.

19:01.891 --> 19:02.847
The President's gonna Kill.

19:02.975 --> 19:05.933
[man] Ladies and gentlemen,
the President of the United States.

19:06.062 --> 19:08.554
-[applause]
-[man] Good evening, sir.

19:08.689 --> 19:10.225
[applause continues]

19:10.358 --> 19:12.816
[indistinct conversations]

19:16.572 --> 19:18.188
[man] Great to see you,
Mr. President.

19:18.324 --> 19:19.780
[woman] How nice to see you, sir.

19:19.909 --> 19:21.946
[indistinct conversations, dog barks]

19:22.078 --> 19:24.035
[Berry] We've reconnoitered
the property.

19:24.163 --> 19:26.404
Lloyd knows a thing or two
about surveillance.

19:26.540 --> 19:28.622
We can't get past the tree line
without tipping him off.

19:28.751 --> 19:29.707
So, it's a siege.

19:29.835 --> 19:31.212
Affirmative, SAC Wells,

19:31.337 --> 19:33.499
until the White House
tells us differently.

19:34.340 --> 19:35.922
[sighs]

19:36.050 --> 19:39.714
[radio chatter]

19:39.845 --> 19:42.303
Damian, you've been tracking Lloyd
as long as I have, right?

19:42.431 --> 19:44.297
-Unsuccessfully, I might add.
-Correct.

19:44.433 --> 19:46.640
That's because every time
you think you have him cornered...

19:46.769 --> 19:48.134
You don't.

19:48.270 --> 19:50.682
Because he always leaves himself
an escape hatch.

19:56.112 --> 19:59.104
A Browning-Reed subsidiary in Greenville
manufactured fertilizer.

19:59.240 --> 20:00.901
Now, the company closed a year ago,

20:01.033 --> 20:03.445
but it stockpiled reagents,
including white phosphorus.

20:03.577 --> 20:05.443
So he had the building blocks
to build sarin gas.

20:05.579 --> 20:07.115
And the technology to deliver it.

20:07.248 --> 20:10.115
Browning-Reed also produced
surface-to-air missiles for the army.

20:10.251 --> 20:12.288
-Do we know what their range is?
-100 miles.

20:12.420 --> 20:13.751
He'll fly them at a low trajectory,

20:13.879 --> 20:16.587
so even if we shoot them down,
the sarin will be dispersed anyway.

20:18.718 --> 20:21.506
General, I want you to start
drawing up plans for a drone strike.

20:21.637 --> 20:24.925
| can't authorize it until we can confirm
what's inside the bunker.

20:25.057 --> 20:27.469
No speculation.
Let's get on this, gentlemen.

20:27.601 --> 20:28.807
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

20:45.161 --> 20:46.196
Damian.

20:46.328 --> 20:47.784
[door creaks]

21:04.472 --> 21:06.930
[Damian] And there's his escape hatch.

21:09.643 --> 21:11.054
[Cowling] Emily.

21:11.187 --> 21:12.473
Oh, hi, Senator.

21:12.605 --> 21:14.346
-Enjoying the festivities?
-Very much.

21:14.482 --> 21:16.894
Listen, I wanted to thank you
for your intelligence update.

21:17.026 --> 21:18.232
Of course.

21:18.360 --> 21:20.317
-Any further developments?
-No.

21:20.446 --> 21:22.153
We are getting
a threat assessment as we speak.

21:22.281 --> 21:24.238
And if Lloyd has sarin?

21:24.366 --> 21:26.528
All proportional military responses
are on the table.

21:26.660 --> 21:30.073
I'm assuming that includes
the use of a tactical drone?

21:30.206 --> 21:32.413
It does. But we'll keep the Committee
in the loop.

21:32.541 --> 21:33.656
Thank you.

21:33.793 --> 21:34.703
[indistinct conversations]

21:34.835 --> 21:36.826
[exhales sharply]

21:36.962 --> 21:39.420
Hey, Seth,
I've got a joke for you.

21:39.548 --> 21:41.130
Oh, thanks, Mike. I'm good.

21:46.055 --> 21:47.887
-Sure, no. Hit me.
-All right.

21:49.350 --> 21:51.057
| was nervous about tonight,

21:51.185 --> 21:53.802
'cause I was afraid
| was gonna bomb.

21:56.357 --> 21:57.893
[laughs]

22:01.153 --> 22:03.941
All right. I like that.
I'll... I'll put it in. Thank you.

22:04.073 --> 22:05.905
Seth, I'm kidding.

22:06.742 --> 22:08.073
[sniffs]

22:08.202 --> 22:09.738
Right. Of course.

22:09.870 --> 22:11.247
| knew that.

22:11.372 --> 22:12.612
-Barrett.
-Mr. President.

22:12.748 --> 22:14.409
It is an honor.

22:15.751 --> 22:17.788
-What did you think of it, sir?
-Think of what?

22:17.920 --> 22:23.040
My book, The Transnational Media
and the Global Marketplace.

22:23.175 --> 22:25.257
| sent you the galleys
a few months ago?

22:25.386 --> 22:27.548
| was honored that you chose
to share that with me.

22:27.680 --> 22:29.296
It's only the first thousand pages.

22:29.431 --> 22:30.967
-[chuckles]
-But I'd love your feedback.

22:31.100 --> 22:33.091
And don't worry, I can take it.

22:33.227 --> 22:34.308
-Well--
-Mr. President,

22:34.436 --> 22:35.813
may I borrow you for a moment?

22:35.938 --> 22:37.770
Barrett, I'm sorry.
Just give me one second.

22:38.607 --> 22:41.599
We have a major problem,
and the clock is ticking, sir.

22:41.735 --> 22:44.113
Congress rushed to court
to preclude your use of a drone.

22:44.238 --> 22:45.603
You're kidding me.

22:46.198 --> 22:47.404
Get me Senator Feller.

22:47.533 --> 22:49.240
It wasn't Senator Feller, sir.

23:03.424 --> 23:04.630
Senator Cowling?

23:04.758 --> 23:06.260
Aaron.

23:06.385 --> 23:07.796
[Officer] All rise.

23:11.307 --> 23:12.388
Sit down.

23:13.601 --> 23:16.013
We are here for petitioner's
emergency motion

23:16.145 --> 23:17.931
to enjoin the Administration's
use of a drone.

23:18.063 --> 23:20.020
Judge, we move
for an immediate dismissal.

23:20.149 --> 23:21.765
Congress has no standing
to challenge

23:21.901 --> 23:24.359
the executive branch's exercise
of its police powers.

23:24.486 --> 23:27.524
But we can challenge its intended
violation of a federal statute.

23:27.656 --> 23:28.942
Posse Comitatus?

23:29.074 --> 23:32.783
Which effectively forbids military action
against an American citizen.

23:32.912 --> 23:33.868
Mr. Ledley?

23:33.996 --> 23:35.486
Uh, just a moment, Your Honor.

23:35.623 --> 23:37.864
| know you haven't reviewed
Petitioner's filing yet.

23:38.000 --> 23:40.537
-If you need a few minutes--
-Judge, we don't have a few minutes.

23:40.669 --> 23:42.626
We have a pressing
national security issue.

23:42.755 --> 23:45.167
We need to get the preliminary
injunction lifted now.

23:45.299 --> 23:48.792
Posse Comitatus is inapplicable
to the current situation, Your Honor.

23:48.928 --> 23:50.134
Mr. Lloyd is an enemy combatant.

23:50.262 --> 23:52.469
He's an American citizen
on American soil

23:52.598 --> 23:55.215
with no stated allegiance
to any foreign power.

23:55.351 --> 23:57.968
The President disagrees
with that restrictive definition.

23:58.103 --> 23:59.559
The President doesn't get
to make that designation.

23:59.688 --> 24:02.976
If he did, he could suspend habeas corpus
by a definitional flip of the switch.

24:03.108 --> 24:05.486
-That's dictatorship, not democracy.
-[Brickner] I agree.

24:05.611 --> 24:07.693
There's no precedent
for a broad expansion

24:07.821 --> 24:09.983
of executive power
on these facts, Mr. Ledley.

24:10.115 --> 24:12.732
The statute can be overridden
if the public faces imminent harm.

24:12.868 --> 24:15.701
We need a showing of that,
Your Honor, not a bald assertion.

24:15.829 --> 24:17.035
Mr. Shore, an offer of proof?

24:19.875 --> 24:21.582
Judge, we have reasonable basis

24:21.710 --> 24:25.328
to believe Mr. Lloyd is
in possession of sarin gas.

24:25.464 --> 24:28.422
Now, he's threatened to use it
against a civilian population.

24:28.550 --> 24:30.757
-And what is that reasonable basis?
-He's already blown up the Capitol.

24:30.886 --> 24:32.877
So at present you have no evidence,
only speculation.

24:33.013 --> 24:35.846
Based on a threat from someone
with a demonstrated proclivity for--

24:35.975 --> 24:38.342
But no conclusive proof, correct?

24:41.230 --> 24:42.516
[Brickner] Mr. Shore?

24:46.151 --> 24:47.528
Conclusive? No.

24:50.572 --> 24:53.109
I'm going to need to take this
under advisement.

24:53.242 --> 24:55.358
Then we're back
with closing arguments.

24:55.995 --> 24:58.908
Judge, we have 50 minutes
until Lloyd releases sarin gas.

24:59.748 --> 25:01.534
Then don't go far.

25:05.838 --> 25:07.203
Senator Cowling.

25:10.259 --> 25:11.545
Aaron.

25:11.927 --> 25:14.134
The President reached out to you
in good faith.

25:14.263 --> 25:17.255
He shared confidential information
vital to national security.

25:17.391 --> 25:19.632
Which you and I both know
he was duty-bound to do.

25:19.768 --> 25:22.260
We have a very different
definition of duty, ma'am.

25:22.396 --> 25:24.763
Patrick Lloyd is a clear
and present danger.

25:24.898 --> 25:28.266
Absolutely. But the danger he poses pales
compared to the danger

25:28.402 --> 25:29.813
of subverting our checks and balances.

25:29.945 --> 25:31.652
You really think President Kirkman
wants to do that?

25:31.780 --> 25:34.158
No. President Kirkman
is a good and decent man.

25:34.283 --> 25:36.069
But his successor might not be.

25:36.201 --> 25:39.410
If I give your guy free rein,
what about the next guy?

25:40.080 --> 25:41.411
[exhales sharply]

25:42.958 --> 25:47.122
Senator, the President wants to make sure
there is a next guy.

25:51.925 --> 25:53.791
-35 minutes to go, sir.
-Thank you.

25:53.927 --> 25:55.793
[indistinct conversations]

25:56.889 --> 25:59.756
John, your prof tiers
diagnosed Lloyd as a sociopath

25:59.892 --> 26:02.008
with a narcissistic
personality disorder, right?

26:02.144 --> 26:03.976
-He's textbook, sir.
-So a trauma from his childhood

26:04.104 --> 26:06.937
would most likely have
contributed to that pathology.

26:07.066 --> 26:08.852
It says here when he was 7 years old,

26:08.984 --> 26:12.102
his father was convicted on multiple
counts of fraud and tax evasion.

26:12.237 --> 26:13.944
He was sent to prison,
and he died there.

26:14.073 --> 26:15.655
Lloyd didn't do much better
with his own son.

26:15.783 --> 26:17.365
They haven't had contact
for a decade.

26:17.493 --> 26:19.985
It was a bitter custody dispute.
He wasn't given visitation.

26:20.621 --> 26:21.827
Family.

26:23.665 --> 26:24.917
Family.

26:25.292 --> 26:29.206
It's the only vaguely coherent chapter
in Pax Americana's manifesto.

26:29.338 --> 26:31.875
He wrote that the cornerstone
of American society

26:32.007 --> 26:34.169
is the relationship
between a parent and their child,

26:34.301 --> 26:37.839
and that that bond is inviolate.
It should be protected at all costs.

26:37.971 --> 26:39.882
He's blaming us.

26:40.015 --> 26:42.131
He thinks we took his father away.

26:42.267 --> 26:44.008
He thinks we took his son.

26:44.520 --> 26:46.636
How the hell
could I have missed that?

26:46.772 --> 26:47.762
Sir?

26:48.357 --> 26:49.973
Pax Americana's a pretext.

26:50.109 --> 26:52.146
He doesn't care about
the political ideology.

26:52.277 --> 26:54.143
This is about revenge.

26:56.156 --> 26:57.863
Excuse me,
can we have the room please?

27:00.619 --> 27:01.950
Thank you.

27:06.792 --> 27:08.749
General, can you patch me
through to his bunker?

27:08.877 --> 27:12.086
Uh, respectfully, sir,
| would strongly advise against that.

27:12.214 --> 27:13.375
So would I. He's unstable.

27:13.507 --> 27:15.748
He might view contact at this stage
as a provocation.

27:15.884 --> 27:17.750
-And act accordingly.
-Well, respectfully,

27:17.886 --> 27:19.843
Patrick Lloyd has killed
over a thousand people,

27:19.972 --> 27:21.588
and he's threatening thousands more,

27:21.723 --> 27:26.138
and all we've done is follow the book.
| suggest we consider rewriting it.

27:27.855 --> 27:29.437
General, patch me through.

27:29.565 --> 27:30.600
Yes, sir.

27:30.732 --> 27:33.224
[device beeping]

27:38.532 --> 27:41.149
Patrick Lloyd, this is Tom Kirkman.

27:47.416 --> 27:48.622
My demands were clear.

27:48.750 --> 27:50.332
[Tom] Clearly impossible.

27:51.086 --> 27:53.623
There's no way out of this,
and you know it.

27:53.755 --> 27:55.792
Then why are we talking?

27:55.924 --> 27:57.915
| heard you saw your son today.

27:58.927 --> 28:00.884
| wanted to know
how that meeting went.

28:02.764 --> 28:04.346
What do you care?

28:06.351 --> 28:07.933
I'm a father, too.

28:08.395 --> 28:09.226
[scoffs]

28:09.354 --> 28:11.095
To be honest, I was moved by the fact

28:11.231 --> 28:13.689
that you chose to see your son
after all these years...

28:17.029 --> 28:19.396
...knowing that this was
coming to an end.

28:20.532 --> 28:21.818
And I wanted to let you know

28:21.950 --> 28:24.362
that we were not gonna
prosecute your boy.

28:25.412 --> 28:26.698
He's my family.

28:28.707 --> 28:30.493
The family the government
stole from me.

28:30.626 --> 28:32.412
The government didn't do that.

28:32.961 --> 28:34.827
But you think it did.

28:34.963 --> 28:36.249
Your quarrel is with us,

28:36.381 --> 28:37.997
not with the thousands of people
that you're threatening.

28:38.133 --> 28:41.125
No, the people
empower this government,

28:41.261 --> 28:43.127
and now they have to answer for that.

28:43.263 --> 28:45.129
Then put America on trial.

28:45.265 --> 28:48.257
You want a platform?
You've got one. A courtroom.

28:48.393 --> 28:49.599
No.

28:50.062 --> 28:51.769
You're not fit to judge me.

28:52.231 --> 28:53.517
But in a few moments,

28:53.649 --> 28:55.481
you will have a judgment to make.

28:55.984 --> 28:59.773
And you know what judgment
that will be, and you will lose.

29:00.113 --> 29:02.696
No... No.

29:02.824 --> 29:04.076
I'll win.

29:05.410 --> 29:07.401
-I've already won.
-[device beeps]

29:08.664 --> 29:10.325
[sighs]

29:27.683 --> 29:30.641
-And another dead end.
-Damn it.

29:31.103 --> 29:34.391
All these corridors branch off
the main one like spokes.

29:34.523 --> 29:36.309
The Vietcong did the same thing
with their tunnels

29:36.441 --> 29:38.182
to disorient the enemy.

29:38.318 --> 29:40.309
Well, they were on to something.

29:41.280 --> 29:43.237
You done any profiling work?

29:43.365 --> 29:45.447
A year, Quantico.

29:46.034 --> 29:48.241
You're building this maze,

29:48.370 --> 29:49.986
you can choose
any shape or mark

29:50.122 --> 29:52.534
connecting the second tunnel
leading to the bunker.

29:53.458 --> 29:56.826
Your subconscious
will influence the design, so...

29:58.213 --> 30:01.831
it could be a straight line,
could be a V.

30:02.551 --> 30:04.383
Or an L...

30:05.679 --> 30:07.044
as in "Lloyd."

30:15.147 --> 30:16.308
Bingo.

30:18.567 --> 30:19.898
[panting]

30:20.027 --> 30:21.267
No keypad.

30:21.403 --> 30:23.019
Why is there no keypad?

30:23.155 --> 30:25.362
He must have another
security protocol.

30:28.410 --> 30:30.822
And I'm standing
right in the middle of it.

30:32.831 --> 30:34.333
Infrared sensor.

30:36.918 --> 30:38.500
Which means
the second I move...

30:39.880 --> 30:40.961
Go.

30:41.089 --> 30:41.954
What?

30:42.090 --> 30:44.422
| ran track for two years at Oxford. Go.

30:47.012 --> 30:47.797
[computerized beeping]

30:47.929 --> 30:49.715
[explosion]

30:52.059 --> 30:53.470
What the hell was that?
What just happened?

30:53.602 --> 30:54.433
Talk to me.

30:55.604 --> 30:57.936
An agent tried to breach the bunker
through an underground tunnel

30:58.065 --> 31:00.523
-and set off a tripwire.
-Which agent?

31:01.401 --> 31:03.142
[sighs] Come on, Hannah.
Pick up the phone.

31:03.278 --> 31:04.393
[cellphone rings]

31:08.909 --> 31:10.991
-Aaron.
-Hannah. Hannah, thank God.

31:11.119 --> 31:12.496
They're telling me
there was an explosion?

31:12.621 --> 31:14.237
Yeah,
Lloyd booby-trapped the tunnel,

31:14.373 --> 31:16.740
and if he went to the trouble,
it suggests planning,

31:16.875 --> 31:18.286
so in terms of threat assessment...

31:18.418 --> 31:21.001
It increases the likelihood
he wasn't bluffing about the sarin.

31:21.129 --> 31:22.335
-Yeah.
-All right.

31:22.464 --> 31:24.125
I'll inform the President
about the new calculus.

31:24.257 --> 31:27.466
Now all you have to do is convince
a court to let us defend ourselves.

31:27.594 --> 31:28.629
[cellphone beeps]

31:37.979 --> 31:40.232
-Counselor.
-Mr. Shore.

31:41.566 --> 31:42.431
[exhales sharply]

31:42.567 --> 31:44.433
You know, you really handed us
our lunch in there.

31:44.569 --> 31:46.025
No. The statute did that.

31:46.154 --> 31:47.656
[scoffs]

31:47.781 --> 31:49.522
One of us is wrong,
and you know that.

31:49.658 --> 31:50.648
That would be you.

31:50.784 --> 31:52.320
Legally, maybe.

31:54.079 --> 31:57.788
But the cost of being
mistaken here... is too high.

32:01.336 --> 32:03.919
[exhales] Sometimes
there's a greater good.

32:04.589 --> 32:06.125
Not for lawyers.

32:06.258 --> 32:09.376
For lawyers, the client's
always the greater good.

32:09.511 --> 32:11.001
And if thousands die...

32:13.473 --> 32:15.931
...you can tell their families that.

32:17.686 --> 32:20.303
Just like we did
when he took out the Capitol.

32:23.442 --> 32:24.932
[Officer] We're back.

32:28.655 --> 32:30.612
See you back inside, Ms. Daynes.

32:35.203 --> 32:36.819
So, what's the hold up?

32:36.955 --> 32:39.822
Hold up? There's no hold up.
It's 7:50, guys.

32:39.958 --> 32:41.995
The President doesn't go on
for another 10 minutes.

32:42.127 --> 32:44.209
-So why is he in hiding?
-I know what the problem is.

32:44.337 --> 32:46.999
The President's read Seth's material,
and he had a heart attack.

32:47.132 --> 32:49.840
Very nice.
Thank you, guys.

32:49.968 --> 32:51.174
I'll see you in there.

32:51.303 --> 32:53.715
[background chatter]

32:53.847 --> 32:57.090
Hey, the show's about to start.
People are getting restless.

32:57.225 --> 32:59.762
You're gonna have to improvise.
The President is now incommunicado.

32:59.895 --> 33:01.886
What? Wait, wait, wait! So...
[hushed] Come here.

33:02.022 --> 33:04.184
If 8:00 rolls around,
and he's still M.I.A.,

33:04.316 --> 33:06.273
-what exactly would you like me to do?
-Talk.

33:06.401 --> 33:08.517
[normal voice] About what?

33:08.653 --> 33:09.688
| don't know. Use your words.

33:09.821 --> 33:12.062
You know, bore them into submission,
fake an anxiety attack.

33:12.199 --> 33:13.906
Well, I'm not gonna have to fake that.

33:15.035 --> 33:18.244
The question before the court
is whether the President can authorize

33:18.371 --> 33:20.783
the use of military force
against civilians,

33:20.916 --> 33:23.783
and the answer requires
simple statutory construction.

33:23.919 --> 33:26.035
The Posse Comitatus Act is clear.

33:26.171 --> 33:28.913
The military cannot enforce
civilian laws.

33:29.841 --> 33:32.879
The military may not use force
against our populace,

33:33.011 --> 33:37.721
because Congress feared a military state,
an abuse of military power.

33:37.849 --> 33:40.637
-Judge, I need a five-minute recess.
-We just got back.

33:40.769 --> 33:42.385
| understand, but it's urgent.

33:42.521 --> 33:44.558
Your client's the one who said
the clock was ticking, counselor.

33:44.689 --> 33:46.521
Judge, please.

33:48.443 --> 33:50.229
Aaron, Aaron, slow down.

33:50.362 --> 33:52.774
The legal obstacle is that
the military's in charge.

33:52.906 --> 33:55.989
Tell the President if he has a civilian
agency like the FBI call the shots,

33:56.117 --> 33:57.858
-the problem goes away.
-Thank you.

33:58.703 --> 34:00.159
General, Mr. Director,

34:00.288 --> 34:02.120
we need to find
the President now.

34:02.249 --> 34:04.160
[man] The FBI's calling it all now.

34:04.292 --> 34:06.124
Let's go, fellas. Go on.
We're out of here.

34:06.253 --> 34:08.119
[indistinct chatter]

34:09.130 --> 34:11.621
-What's our status?
-Green light, sir.

34:12.300 --> 34:14.132
Have we got confirmation
on the sarin gas yet?

34:14.261 --> 34:16.342
No. Given everything
we know, I'd say it's 50-50.

34:16.471 --> 34:17.802
[Beckwith] It's a coin toss,
Mr. President.

34:17.931 --> 34:19.763
We know he was planning something,
we just can't say what.

34:19.891 --> 34:21.802
10 seconds, Mr. President.
You need to make the call.

34:22.601 --> 34:25.560
Five, four, three...

34:26.273 --> 34:27.728
-Engage.
-It's a go.

34:33.905 --> 34:35.862
[explosion]

34:35.991 --> 34:37.777
[man] Direct hit, sir.

34:37.909 --> 34:39.570
Target has been neutralized.

34:48.753 --> 34:50.960
[sirens wail]

34:52.674 --> 34:55.335
[mixed chatter]

35:11.151 --> 35:12.357
Right.

35:12.819 --> 35:14.685
-Did he have the gas?
-No, sir.

35:14.821 --> 35:18.189
We've got his remains, but there was
no evidence of nerve gas. It was a bluff.

35:22.662 --> 35:24.369
Then I need to tell
the American people

35:24.497 --> 35:25.908
that we were working off of good

35:26.041 --> 35:27.748
but ultimately erroneous information,

35:27.876 --> 35:30.584
and I authorized a drone strike
on American soil.

35:30.712 --> 35:32.703
-Y-You can't tell them that, sir.
-Why not?

35:32.839 --> 35:34.204
Respectfully, Mr. President,

35:34.341 --> 35:38.209
this night is about triumph,
not recrimination.

35:38.345 --> 35:40.586
America believes in leaders
that deliver victory -

35:40.722 --> 35:42.338
unambiguous victory.

35:42.474 --> 35:44.841
Mr. President,
Patrick Lloyd was responsible

35:44.976 --> 35:47.013
for the deaths of over 1,000 people.

35:47.145 --> 35:50.012
After all the suffering,
the country deserves its moment.

35:55.195 --> 35:56.230
You're right.

35:58.323 --> 36:00.064
So let's give it to them.

36:00.325 --> 36:01.315
But not here.

36:04.871 --> 36:06.862
Good evening, my fellow Americans.

36:06.998 --> 36:08.955
<i>At 800 p.m.
Eastern Standard Time,</i>

36:09.084 --> 36:10.791
acting pursuant to my authorization,

36:10.919 --> 36:12.876
the FBI conducted a drone strike

36:13.004 --> 36:15.746
on a fortified bunker
in Rockville, Maryland.

36:15.882 --> 36:18.590
That bunker was occupied
by Patrick Lloyd.

36:18.718 --> 36:22.712
Mr. Lloyd refused repeated
requests to surrender.

36:22.847 --> 36:24.133
Instead, he indicated

36:24.265 --> 36:25.881
that he was in possession of nerve gas,

36:26.017 --> 36:29.100
which he stated was
his intention to use on civilians.

36:29.229 --> 36:32.642
| can now confirm that Patrick Lloyd
has been neutralized,

36:32.774 --> 36:36.392
along with the ongoing threat
that he posed to our great nation.

36:36.528 --> 36:40.066
We have weathered his challenge,
but there will be others,

36:40.198 --> 36:42.610
and I will be here
to meet them with you.

36:42.742 --> 36:46.076
God bless you,
and God bless America.

36:46.454 --> 36:47.785
[man] And we're out.

36:47.914 --> 36:49.450
Thank you.

36:51.626 --> 36:53.458
[sighs]

36:54.462 --> 36:56.749
[whispering] Hey.
Sorry about your jokes.

36:56.881 --> 36:58.133
[inhales sharply]

36:58.258 --> 37:00.249
It's okay.
They weren't that funny anyway.

37:09.436 --> 37:10.471
[Mike] Mr. President.

37:11.604 --> 37:13.891
Ms. Daynes.
Please come in.

37:14.482 --> 37:15.563
Mr. President.

37:16.985 --> 37:18.771
| heard you fought
like a lion today.

37:18.903 --> 37:19.938
Yes, sir.

37:20.071 --> 37:21.527
Thank you for your service.

37:21.656 --> 37:23.647
You're a gracious loser, sir.

37:23.783 --> 37:24.989
Excuse me?

37:25.118 --> 37:26.859
- I represented the Senate.
-Please.

37:26.995 --> 37:30.613
Your Administration was contemplating
a statutory violation.

37:30.749 --> 37:33.332
We went to court to stop that,
and we did.

37:33.460 --> 37:35.121
You cured the violation.

37:35.253 --> 37:37.995
We've had to outsource
our legal work for the last year.

37:38.131 --> 37:39.713
We couldn't quite find the right fit.

37:39.841 --> 37:43.209
But I think the White House Counsel's
office has been vacant for far too long,

37:43.344 --> 37:45.836
so if you're interested in
being overworked and underpaid--

37:45.972 --> 37:47.133
I'm sorry, sir.

37:47.265 --> 37:48.881
You're sorry
because you're not interested,

37:49.017 --> 37:50.678
or you're already
overworked and underpaid?

37:50.810 --> 37:51.891
No, of course.

37:52.020 --> 37:53.806
Overpaid and underworked...

37:53.938 --> 37:57.397
| mean, underpaid and overworked.
That would be...

37:57.525 --> 37:58.981
not disqualifying, sir,
not remotely,

37:59.110 --> 38:00.350
and by not disqualifying--

38:00.487 --> 38:03.605
| hope the word
you're looking for is "Yes."

38:05.950 --> 38:07.816
Yes, Mr. President.

38:07.952 --> 38:09.863
| would be honored
to work for you, sir.

38:09.996 --> 38:12.488
Good. I'm grateful.

38:12.874 --> 38:15.081
You better get some rest.
You're gonna need it.

38:15.210 --> 38:17.201
-Yes, Mr. President.
-Thank you.

38:28.640 --> 38:30.381
[exhales sharply]

38:36.356 --> 38:38.347
[sighs]

38:47.575 --> 38:48.565
[chuckles]

39:05.093 --> 39:07.334
[Penny] You still have
to kiss me good night.

39:12.600 --> 39:15.342
-Hey, Little Pea.
-Hi.

39:17.397 --> 39:19.013
Did you have a good day?

39:19.691 --> 39:21.602
Yeah. Did you?

39:24.696 --> 39:27.404
| had a day
where I had to be President.

39:27.532 --> 39:29.773
-Isn't that every day?
-[chuckles]

39:30.535 --> 39:32.572
You want to hear a joke?

39:32.704 --> 39:33.785
Yeah.

39:33.913 --> 39:36.154
So, as I look out across the room,

39:36.291 --> 39:38.328
| see Senator Lee on the left,

39:38.459 --> 39:40.325
but by the end of the evening,

39:40.461 --> 39:42.793
| promise you
he'll be on the right.

39:43.381 --> 39:44.667
That's not funny.

39:44.799 --> 39:46.301
[chuckles] I know.

39:47.051 --> 39:48.303
| have a joke.

39:48.595 --> 39:50.586
-Knock, knock.
-Who's there?

39:50.722 --> 39:51.678
Interrupting bird.

39:51.806 --> 39:53.638
-Interrupting b--
-Squawk!

39:54.976 --> 39:56.432
That's pretty good.

39:57.061 --> 39:58.347
You want a job?

39:58.479 --> 39:59.469
| have a job.

40:01.274 --> 40:03.436
I'm the President's daughter.

40:04.110 --> 40:05.896
Yes, you are.

40:06.946 --> 40:08.482
Come on.
It's time for bed.

40:09.574 --> 40:11.941
| hope you have
the best sleep ever.

40:12.076 --> 40:13.817
| love you.

40:13.953 --> 40:15.489
| love you too.

40:17.123 --> 40:19.285
-Night, night.
-Good night.

40:29.177 --> 40:31.839
[indistinct conversations]

40:35.350 --> 40:38.263
[Damian] Hannah,
you're gonna want to see this.

40:47.153 --> 40:49.690
They found Lloyd's computer.

40:50.448 --> 40:52.985
Half melted, but Trevor here
worked his magic.

40:53.117 --> 40:54.073
What'd you find?

40:54.202 --> 40:56.489
The hard drive's mostly fried,
but Lloyd figured out a way

40:56.621 --> 40:58.077
to hack through the firewall we put up.

40:58.206 --> 41:00.538
He was uploading something to the cloud
when the bomb hit.

41:00.667 --> 41:02.203
Do you know what it was?
