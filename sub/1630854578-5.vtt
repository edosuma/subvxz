00:06.000 --> 00:07.791
<i>Previously on</i> The Recruit:

00:07.875 --> 00:09.666
-You remember Dawn Gilbane?

00:09.750 --> 00:11.333
Dawn. You look different.

00:11.416 --> 00:12.750
Operations wants to insert Meladze

00:12.833 --> 00:15.250
back into the Russian mob in Belarus
as an asset.

00:15.333 --> 00:17.291
Are you sure this is how
we should be playing it?

00:17.375 --> 00:19.708
<i>-What if she told him about us?</i>
-We'll deal with it.

00:19.791 --> 00:22.416
Max created a niche business
when she hit town.

00:22.500 --> 00:24.875
-She crossed a line with that money.
-Who is Not Bob?

00:24.958 --> 00:28.791
-A legend in the agency.
-I got Not Bob's name from my graymailer.

00:28.875 --> 00:30.333
-You're lying.
-I'm not.

00:30.416 --> 00:34.166
-Hi guys. I could use your help.
-Owen needs to make his case federal.

00:34.250 --> 00:37.083
It's our opportunity
to get someone in close to him.

00:37.166 --> 00:39.750
I just worry that the CIA
will amplify your worst instincts.

00:39.833 --> 00:43.166
I'm 24. I'm supposed
to make mistakes, take big swings.

00:43.250 --> 00:44.208
Go!

00:44.708 --> 00:47.708
I begged you not to do anything,
and you hired a hitman.

00:47.791 --> 00:50.291
-I'm sorry I didn't trust you.
-No! We are done.

00:50.375 --> 00:52.041
The asset
is being released tonight.

00:52.125 --> 00:53.750
We're mission-planning two options.

00:53.833 --> 00:56.541
One to put her back in country,
the other to put her in the ground.

01:09.333 --> 01:10.208
Get in.

01:14.416 --> 01:16.916
<i>...that earlier accident</i>
<i>out near the fairgrounds,</i>

01:17.000 --> 01:19.458
<i>PPD has yet to get a tow in there</i>
<i>to clear that big rig,</i>

01:19.541 --> 01:21.625
<i>and now traffic is backed up</i>
<i>in all directions</i>

01:21.708 --> 01:25.333
<i>on McDowell Road,</i>
<i>Grand Avenue and 19th Avenue.</i>

01:25.416 --> 01:28.208
<i>If you're headed out towards the</i>
<i>fairgrounds or Veterans Memorial,</i>

01:28.291 --> 01:31.833
<i>I suggest you try</i>
<i>either 15th Avenue to Encanto Boulevard</i>

01:31.916 --> 01:34.166
<i>-or take Wickenburg High--</i>
-Thanks for the ride.

01:34.250 --> 01:35.916
No, we're going in with you.

01:57.916 --> 02:00.000
Cops really did a number
searching your place.

02:01.916 --> 02:02.958
I need to sleep.

03:53.416 --> 03:55.000
What?

03:57.333 --> 03:58.541
Hi. Where--?

04:00.125 --> 04:00.958
Fuck.

04:01.041 --> 04:02.000
Where am I?

04:02.083 --> 04:03.083
Washington, D.C.

04:04.416 --> 04:07.208
-Where's the plane going next?
-Back to Phoenix.

04:07.791 --> 04:10.583
That's not any better.
Can it go somewhere else, please?

04:10.666 --> 04:12.916
Sir, you have to get off the airplane.

04:15.375 --> 04:16.208
Okay.

04:30.583 --> 04:31.416
Hey.

04:32.541 --> 04:33.583
Hey.

04:35.958 --> 04:38.291
You look like you've been spun in a dryer.

04:38.375 --> 04:39.250
Thank you.

04:39.916 --> 04:41.708
-Are you okay?
-Uh-huh.

04:41.791 --> 04:43.750
Yeah. Just tired. Took a red-eye.

04:51.666 --> 04:54.125
I'm not talking about your flight, Owen.

04:54.208 --> 04:57.791
Are you really gonna pretend
everything's cool after that phone call?

04:57.875 --> 04:59.000
Everything is cool.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.083
Those are for your computer screen.

05:06.916 --> 05:09.708
Look, I really appreciate
the tough love last night, I do.

05:09.791 --> 05:13.750
Even if I could tell you, there's no point
because you would tell me I should quit.

05:13.833 --> 05:15.208
No, I won't.

05:16.041 --> 05:16.958
But you should.

05:21.125 --> 05:22.875
I don't know why I bother.

05:25.833 --> 05:29.750
Because you're a good person.
You have a soft spot for lost causes.

05:29.833 --> 05:32.000
But honestly, last night was my low point.

05:32.083 --> 05:35.916
And I know that
because the thing that caused it is over.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.041
It's never over, Owen.

05:38.666 --> 05:41.000
Jobs like yours get harder, not easier.

05:42.250 --> 05:46.458
Sure. But this case,
the one that caused me to just spin out,

05:47.500 --> 05:48.500
is behind me.

05:51.333 --> 05:54.875
I'm gonna be around a lot more,
so I won't get so lost.

05:55.500 --> 05:56.666
That would be good.

05:57.333 --> 06:01.166
What, me not getting so lost
or me hanging around a lot more?

06:04.500 --> 06:05.333
Both.

06:12.833 --> 06:16.875
-"Send Amelia flowers."
-Yes, that's right. I forgot about that.

06:16.958 --> 06:18.875
You send women flowers now.

06:18.958 --> 06:21.833
No, first time.
But figured it was the adult thing to do.

06:21.916 --> 06:23.875
I actually don't even know
where to get flowers.

06:23.958 --> 06:24.958
A florist.

06:25.041 --> 06:26.250
Oh, do you have one?

06:26.750 --> 06:29.541
You want me to help you
buy flowers for your girlfriend?

06:29.625 --> 06:32.416
She's not my girlfriend.
Never mind. I can figure it out.

06:39.500 --> 06:42.500
-Owen Hendricks?
-Uh, yeah. Who are you?

06:42.583 --> 06:45.125
Secret Service.
We need you to come with us.

06:45.666 --> 06:46.500
Over, huh?

06:46.583 --> 06:48.875
I'm sure this has nothing to do with that.

06:48.958 --> 06:52.250
-What does this have to do with--?
-I can't tell you that. Let's go.

06:53.958 --> 06:55.458
Okay. Uh--

06:56.250 --> 06:57.250
Have a great day.

06:58.125 --> 06:58.958
Best day ever.

06:59.458 --> 07:00.416
Yeah. After you.

07:04.875 --> 07:06.083
Lester?

07:06.166 --> 07:07.166
Down here.

07:09.375 --> 07:10.291
Back's bothering me.

07:10.375 --> 07:14.541
Must be all the years riding in rusty cars
and sleeping on cut-rate mattresses.

07:14.625 --> 07:17.583
Well, pull yourself together,
because we have a crisis to solve.

07:17.666 --> 07:19.333
Nyland is happy.

07:19.958 --> 07:22.208
Not with us obviously,
or your face wouldn't be doing that.

07:22.291 --> 07:24.375
No, with the young Owen Hendricks.

07:24.458 --> 07:27.083
He got his graymail case
thrown out of court.

07:27.166 --> 07:29.083
Rumor has it
he came up with a genius move,

07:29.166 --> 07:31.041
and now Nyland thinks
the kid walks on water.

07:31.125 --> 07:33.541
I'd be impressed if I wasn't so annoyed.

07:33.625 --> 07:36.166
-We're gonna have to change strategies.
-No.

07:36.250 --> 07:39.500
Violet, think about it.
If he's got Nyland's ear,

07:39.583 --> 07:42.083
that means he can sabotage us
the way we've been sabotaging him.

07:42.166 --> 07:44.000
Yeah, but he's already sabotaged me.

07:44.083 --> 07:46.666
He threw me under the bus
with that whole AI thing.

07:46.750 --> 07:50.791
And I hold a grudge. Trust me,
the kid might be a shooting star now,

07:50.875 --> 07:53.916
but he's gonna crash and burn.
We just have to give him some time.

07:54.000 --> 07:57.416
Fine. But while we wait,
we pivot to get on his good side.

07:58.083 --> 08:00.875
Drop your elbow on my shoulder
right there. Come on now.

08:00.958 --> 08:01.791
All right.

08:07.416 --> 08:10.375
Uh, yes, it's the Spring Is Here bouquet

08:10.458 --> 08:13.708
plus delivery charges
and then the personalized card.

08:13.791 --> 08:16.125
Okay, yup. Thank you, Denise.
Super helpful.

08:16.958 --> 08:19.500
Flowers for my--
She's not really my girlfriend.

08:19.583 --> 08:20.833
She's more than a coworker.

08:20.916 --> 08:24.541
I find the whole term
"friends with benefits" kind of icky.

08:24.625 --> 08:27.666
Wait. Who are you taking me to see?

08:31.916 --> 08:35.625
Mr. Hendricks, I'm Kevin Mills,
chief of staff to the president.

08:37.291 --> 08:38.125
Not Bob.

08:38.833 --> 08:41.625
-Not here.
-Right. "Here" being the White House?

08:42.125 --> 08:44.208
We're in an old executive office building.

08:44.291 --> 08:46.791
I wouldn't bring you to the White House
on a first date,

08:46.875 --> 08:48.750
especially one that requires deniability.

08:49.958 --> 08:53.875
-Why did you bring me here, sir?
-I still have ears inside Langley,

08:53.958 --> 08:57.541
and you've been throwing the name
you just said around. Why?

08:58.333 --> 09:02.958
Because someone who's graymailing us
said that you were one of her handlers.

09:03.041 --> 09:04.750
-Who?
-Maxine Meladze.

09:05.833 --> 09:06.708
She's lying.

09:09.541 --> 09:11.583
I've heard of her,
but she wasn't one of mine.

09:11.666 --> 09:14.541
I was too far up the food chain
by the time she became an asset.

09:14.625 --> 09:19.625
But even if I was her case officer,
she only would have known my cover name

09:19.708 --> 09:21.250
because I'm not an idiot.

09:22.333 --> 09:23.250
Uh...

09:24.875 --> 09:30.833
So you're saying, sir,
that someone is pretending to be you

09:30.916 --> 09:32.875
and not Not Bob?

09:32.958 --> 09:34.000
I don't know.

09:34.083 --> 09:38.125
But someone inside the agency
fed her my internal nickname.

09:38.208 --> 09:41.583
And if they leaked that, they sure as shit
could have leaked other secrets.

09:42.125 --> 09:45.958
I need you to find out who gave me up.

09:48.583 --> 09:50.500
Sir, you were Moscow station chief.

09:50.583 --> 09:53.375
Couldn't you just run down her contacts
and do this with them?

09:53.458 --> 09:55.166
Not with a hip-pocket asset.

09:55.250 --> 09:59.458
And the only handler I knew about
was Rita Stevens. And she's dead.

10:00.750 --> 10:03.958
-Did Max...?
-No. Rita drank like it made the sun rise.

10:04.041 --> 10:05.583
She got liver cancer.

10:06.708 --> 10:09.750
Even on her worst bender,
she never would make a mistake like this.

10:11.000 --> 10:12.375
Sir, the thing is, um...

10:13.625 --> 10:17.375
Well, as of last night,
I'm actually off of Max's case.

10:24.916 --> 10:28.250
Son, I'm the gatekeeper to the president.

10:29.791 --> 10:34.000
I have a Distinguished Intelligence Medal
locked in a drawer inside of Langley.

10:34.708 --> 10:36.916
There are enemy combatants
in unmarked graves

10:37.000 --> 10:39.958
in places you've never even heard of
because of me.

10:41.500 --> 10:43.875
Do you really think you can say no here?

10:46.541 --> 10:50.625
I'm new at the General Counsel's Office,
and the case has been a really rocky road,

10:50.750 --> 10:54.416
so I'm worried about emotionally
re-engaging with Miss Meladze.

10:54.500 --> 10:56.125
-I don't care.
-That's fair.

10:57.958 --> 11:01.583
I'll see what I can find. You wouldn't
have anything for me to go off of, though?

11:01.666 --> 11:04.125
Because as you said,
she's a hip-pocket asset.

11:04.208 --> 11:06.916
Finding paperwork
has been pretty difficult.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.083
Sounds like you have
your work cut out for you.

11:09.958 --> 11:12.125
Call me when you find something.

11:12.750 --> 11:13.750
And find it fast.

11:14.666 --> 11:16.208
I don't like loose ends.

11:17.708 --> 11:18.541
Yes, sir.

11:22.625 --> 11:23.541
Amelia Salazar.

11:23.625 --> 11:26.500
This is Officer Weathers
at the front gate. We have a delivery.

11:26.583 --> 11:28.416
-Subpoena?
<i>-Flowers.</i>

11:29.250 --> 11:30.333
Oh.

11:30.416 --> 11:32.250
Okay. I'll be down in a minute.

11:35.125 --> 11:35.958
She's on the way.

11:44.750 --> 11:47.125
-What you got?
-Uh, tulips.

11:48.208 --> 11:50.916
A romantically-neutral choice,
don't you think?

11:51.416 --> 11:53.750
-Well, they ain't roses.
-Gun!

11:54.250 --> 11:56.250
-What?

11:58.666 --> 12:01.208
<i>We have report</i>
<i>of a Taser employed today.</i>

12:01.291 --> 12:02.541
What the fuck, dude?

12:02.625 --> 12:05.583
Federal law prohibits the possession
of a firearm at this facility

12:05.666 --> 12:07.500
unless specifically authorized.

12:08.458 --> 12:10.583
You couldn't at least
secure the flowers first?

12:10.666 --> 12:11.875
Sorry, Miss Salazar.

12:21.208 --> 12:24.166
Uh, we got a problem.

12:24.250 --> 12:25.291
You better call.

12:25.375 --> 12:26.791
I'm not calling.

12:31.750 --> 12:35.625
We'll need at least two teams to pave the
way for Meladze to get back to Belarus.

12:35.708 --> 12:37.333
Let's see who's available.

12:41.416 --> 12:42.250
What?

12:44.083 --> 12:46.000
No, don't do a fucking thing.

12:46.083 --> 12:47.000
I'll handle it.

12:48.333 --> 12:50.958
-Problem?
-Meladze slipped the locals.

12:51.833 --> 12:53.625
It's most likely a power play.

12:53.708 --> 12:56.916
-Trying to show us we don't control her.
-If it's more than that?

13:05.291 --> 13:06.541
Okay.

13:07.208 --> 13:08.166
Someone's happy.

13:08.666 --> 13:12.125
I just closed a case.
Things are looking up, or they were.

13:12.208 --> 13:15.083
-Max is in the wind.
-Wow. Sounds like a you problem.

13:15.583 --> 13:18.666
-What was the last thing Max said to you?
-"Goodbye."

13:18.750 --> 13:20.791
-Do you know where she went?
-No.

13:20.875 --> 13:22.916
You need to start taking this
more seriously.

13:23.000 --> 13:25.083
Meladze is your responsibility.

13:26.750 --> 13:31.458
No, she's yours. I did my job.
Stop trying to pin your failures on me.

13:31.541 --> 13:34.583
I don't know where she is.
I don't wanna know. And for good measure,

13:34.666 --> 13:35.500
I don't care.

13:36.750 --> 13:37.875
So have a nice day.

13:45.875 --> 13:48.541
Okay, cognitive theory of aggression.

13:49.541 --> 13:53.708
Specifically, that aggressive behavior
is learned rather than innate.

13:54.708 --> 13:57.333
Which is the opposite
of the psychodynamic approach, right?

13:57.416 --> 14:00.458
-Where violence is inherently biological.
-Correct.

14:01.458 --> 14:03.250
Okay, that's it for today.

14:17.666 --> 14:19.500
I never took you for a student.

14:23.916 --> 14:26.166
That's because you're a hot mess
of implicit bias.

14:26.791 --> 14:28.416
I'm getting my psych degree

14:28.500 --> 14:31.416
to help me navigate the different
personality archetypes I deal with.

14:31.500 --> 14:34.166
Sociopaths, narcissists with ASPD.

14:35.041 --> 14:37.541
I deal with a lot of unstable assholes
is my point.

14:37.625 --> 14:41.000
If you get your boss to agree to my terms,
you can deal with one less.

14:42.291 --> 14:43.250
Terms for what?

14:43.333 --> 14:44.583
My business.

14:45.250 --> 14:46.916
We have safe houses already.

14:47.000 --> 14:50.958
No. You have stash houses
and whorehouses and drop houses.

14:51.541 --> 14:53.000
And they're cop magnets.

14:53.083 --> 14:54.916
My system eliminates that risk.

14:55.000 --> 14:58.125
Yeah, I know.
You got some special system. What is it?

14:59.666 --> 15:02.291
How do you find
these untraceable properties?

15:02.375 --> 15:04.500
I'll tell you, when you pay me 5 million.

15:04.583 --> 15:07.541
That's too much.
See, you think you shit ice cream.

15:08.041 --> 15:10.541
And in psych terms,
that's called the Dunning-Kruger effect.

15:10.625 --> 15:14.416
No, Dunning-Kruger is when dumbasses
think they're smart. I am smart.

15:14.916 --> 15:16.416
The question is, are you?

15:19.708 --> 15:22.500
We both know
that your boss wants what I have.

15:22.583 --> 15:26.000
So I'll give you one day to make the deal.

15:27.750 --> 15:28.750
Oh.

15:29.833 --> 15:31.625
And then I'll go to someone else.

16:01.583 --> 16:02.583
Are you done?

16:03.166 --> 16:06.375
Get your ass back. Meladze's
here heading for the west garage.

16:06.458 --> 16:11.166
She's selling her safe house hookup,
but we can torture that shit out of her.

16:11.250 --> 16:13.666
-And we'll be heroes for El Jefe.
-<i>Okay.</i>

16:45.833 --> 16:48.750
-Oh, God.
-Who's got Dunning-Kruger now?

16:52.875 --> 16:55.166
Another genius. On your knees.

16:55.250 --> 16:56.208
Now!

16:58.083 --> 16:59.375
Drop your gun.

17:13.125 --> 17:13.958
So...

17:14.458 --> 17:15.875
here's where we're at.

17:15.958 --> 17:20.708
You took a shot at me and you missed.
The price has just gone up to 6 million.

17:21.333 --> 17:25.833
You'll be dealing with a proxy from now on
because I clearly can't trust you.

17:32.750 --> 17:33.583
What the fuck?

17:52.125 --> 17:55.041
-<i>Hello?</i>
-Tell your boss I need the lawyer back.

18:00.333 --> 18:01.166
Who was it?

18:06.833 --> 18:08.666
-Hi.
-Thank you for the flowers.

18:08.750 --> 18:10.916
-Oh. It was nothing.
-It was very sweet.

18:11.000 --> 18:14.125
FYI, I left a pre-vetted list of vendors
on your desk for next time.

18:14.208 --> 18:17.791
-It'll help streamline the process.
-Oh. So next time. Awesome.

18:18.416 --> 18:20.875
Tonight, even. If you're free.

18:20.958 --> 18:22.166
I am.

18:22.250 --> 18:25.541
You know, I got my graymail thrown out
with a big assist from you.

18:25.625 --> 18:28.458
So prepare
to be enthusiastically thanked later.

18:28.541 --> 18:30.125
-Oh, right on.
-Mm-hm.

18:30.208 --> 18:33.250
So, FYI,
Nyland seems really happy with you.

18:34.875 --> 18:36.250
-Did he say that?
-Mm.

18:37.208 --> 18:38.125
Double awesome.

18:38.666 --> 18:41.166
You know,
I literally pulled off a miracle.

18:41.708 --> 18:43.375
-If I can say that.
-You can.

18:43.458 --> 18:45.625
I find earned confidence super sexy.

18:46.125 --> 18:50.166
Then I find you super sexy.
I can't wait for tonight.

18:50.250 --> 18:52.833
Me neither. Get ready
to role-play a combative interviewer

18:52.916 --> 18:55.250
who I make look foolish
on live television.

18:55.333 --> 18:56.916
-That always gets me hot.
-Mm.

18:59.416 --> 19:00.583
-Hey, my man.
-Whoa.

19:00.666 --> 19:03.583
-Heard you had a pretty big win yesterday.
-You heard right.

19:03.666 --> 19:07.041
Congratulations. Clear victories
are hard to come by in this place.

19:07.125 --> 19:08.125
Thank you.

19:08.208 --> 19:09.041
Hey, heads up.

19:09.125 --> 19:12.000
Violet and I grabbed a couple
of incoming cases from your inbox.

19:12.083 --> 19:14.333
Didn't want you to get swamped
when you came back.

19:14.416 --> 19:15.375
I can't do this.

19:18.750 --> 19:21.833
-Can't do what?
-Nothing. Hey, make yourself at home.

19:21.916 --> 19:25.750
I'd love to hear details on that win
that won't get me subpoenaed.

19:25.833 --> 19:27.416
-You're on.
-All right.

19:27.500 --> 19:29.291
-Thanks for having my back.
-Hey, no problem.

19:29.375 --> 19:31.000
Seriously, I appreciate it.

19:36.875 --> 19:37.958
All right.

19:45.875 --> 19:46.750
Okay.

19:48.416 --> 19:49.375
Owen Hendricks.

19:49.458 --> 19:51.125
I need you back in Phoenix.

20:06.416 --> 20:09.041
I'm done with you, Max.
Do not call me again.

20:25.125 --> 20:26.458
I said leave me alone.

20:26.541 --> 20:30.500
<i>-I can't. I need help with something.</i>
-You're not my person anymore.

20:30.583 --> 20:34.250
My job was to get you out of prison.
You're out. I'm done.

20:34.333 --> 20:37.750
<i>Not your decision.</i>
<i>And you're about to be reminded of that.</i>

20:41.458 --> 20:42.958
<i>It's about me. I'll wait.</i>

20:49.083 --> 20:49.916
Hello?

20:50.416 --> 20:53.375
<i>The General Counsel</i>
<i>needs to see you in his office.</i>

20:54.208 --> 20:56.541
-Now?
-<i>Yes. Right now.</i>

20:57.916 --> 20:58.750
Okay.

21:07.416 --> 21:09.125
See you in Phoenix, handsome.

21:22.583 --> 21:23.708
What are you doing?

21:24.750 --> 21:27.041
Can't trust the sweeteners
in the break room.

21:27.125 --> 21:30.416
My rogue SOG team
are trying to gaslight me again.

21:30.500 --> 21:34.833
I might have to resign, like today.
How do I do that? Is it a letter or--?

21:35.833 --> 21:40.250
You can't resign. The engine's
all over the floor of the garage.

21:40.833 --> 21:43.833
-Uh, what?
-It's an analogy.

21:43.916 --> 21:47.625
Your cases are car engines.
The second you start to work on one,

21:47.708 --> 21:50.833
you start to take the engine apart,
putting parts on the floor of the garage.

21:50.916 --> 21:53.291
You can't walk away
until you put them all back,

21:53.375 --> 21:55.083
then you'll get blamed
for the mess you left.

21:55.166 --> 21:59.083
Every time you think you're done,
there are new parts on the floor.

21:59.166 --> 22:02.125
Parts that don't go back in,
parts you don't know what to do with.

22:02.208 --> 22:06.750
You start stuffing them in your pockets.
But they keep coming, and coming.

22:06.833 --> 22:08.625
Have you ever had a panic attack?

22:08.708 --> 22:11.375
Oh, I've been having one continuously
since 2019. You get used to it.

22:11.458 --> 22:16.000
-No. No, I don't-- I don't want to.
-Then you should quit. But you can't.

22:16.083 --> 22:18.916
Then you become a scapegoat
for every bad thing that's happened

22:19.000 --> 22:20.708
since you stepped foot in this place.

22:22.041 --> 22:26.416
Wait a minute. If you quit, then I can
dump my Spec Ops nightmare on you.

22:26.916 --> 22:29.875
-I take it back. Resign immediately.
-You're not helping me.

22:29.958 --> 22:31.333
I'm not trying to.

22:31.416 --> 22:36.041
Oh, hey, fun fact: The last guy who quit
in a panic got blamed for Abu Ghraib.

22:38.458 --> 22:39.458
<i>You can go in.</i>

22:43.666 --> 22:45.416
I said, you can go in now.

22:47.875 --> 22:48.708
Okay.

22:50.416 --> 22:51.583
Is there a problem?

22:53.708 --> 22:54.541
So many.

23:07.125 --> 23:08.083
Come in.

23:12.416 --> 23:13.625
You wanted to see me, sir?

23:13.708 --> 23:16.833
Why is our former asset demanding
that you come back to Phoenix?

23:18.083 --> 23:18.916
I don't know.

23:19.000 --> 23:20.833
Sir, I finished with her case yesterday.

23:20.916 --> 23:22.291
Apparently, you didn't.

23:23.083 --> 23:25.041
Is there something going on
between you two?

23:29.291 --> 23:30.500
Absolutely not.

23:30.583 --> 23:33.750
-Then why does she want you?
-I don't know.

23:33.833 --> 23:36.833
Maybe because I kept my promise
and got her out of prison,

23:36.916 --> 23:39.291
while all Operations did was abandon her

23:39.375 --> 23:42.000
after she risked her life
to provide the agency with intel.

23:43.041 --> 23:45.791
I had nothing to do
with Meladze's asset termination.

23:46.833 --> 23:48.875
I'm here to reinsert her
back into her old life.

23:48.958 --> 23:51.083
Yeah. Well, she knows you need her.

23:51.666 --> 23:54.583
So she's testing us,
seeing how far she can push.

23:56.583 --> 23:58.583
Sir, the director is on line one.

23:59.625 --> 24:03.208
-Go to Phoenix. Bring her back. No drama.

24:03.291 --> 24:04.458
Yes, sir.

24:04.541 --> 24:07.666
From this moment on,
everything has to be done by the book.

24:08.458 --> 24:09.291
Of course.

24:15.583 --> 24:17.166
Max is playing games. It's what she does.

24:17.250 --> 24:20.208
I agree. But for now,
we have to play along.

24:20.291 --> 24:23.041
She likely slipped her detail
so she could clean up loose ends

24:23.125 --> 24:24.333
before she leaves Phoenix.

24:24.416 --> 24:26.916
Well, those loose ends
are 100% criminal in nature.

24:27.000 --> 24:28.166
Don't let her get caught.

24:28.250 --> 24:30.333
-Hell, you take the fall if you have to.
-Fuck that.

24:35.125 --> 24:39.333
You know what this is?
A World War II Liberator pistol.

24:40.250 --> 24:43.333
The Allies dropped a ton of them
behind Axis lines for resistance fighters.

24:43.416 --> 24:44.833
Single bullet, no range.

24:44.916 --> 24:47.875
But it only had to be good enough
to get a better gun off a Nazi.

24:47.958 --> 24:50.541
Yeah. If this is another lecture
about leverage, I get it.

24:50.625 --> 24:51.791
Max has the better gun.

24:51.875 --> 24:56.625
Max is the better gun. A conduit
to the new head of Russian intelligence.

24:57.208 --> 24:59.916
You're the expendable gun
that I am using to get her.

25:00.583 --> 25:02.375
So go get her.

25:05.333 --> 25:07.791
Way to make me feel
like a valued team member.

25:08.791 --> 25:09.625
Pack a bag.

25:09.708 --> 25:13.000
You're shadowing Hendricks to Phoenix.
Something's going on between those two.

25:13.083 --> 25:16.125
And Meladze is too valuable to us
to let him fuck this up.

25:25.791 --> 25:27.208
-There you are.

25:29.250 --> 25:30.666
Thanks for coming down, man.

25:31.291 --> 25:34.166
Are you kidding.
I was desperate to get out of the office.

25:34.666 --> 25:37.791
A government building
is the worst place to be post-breakup.

25:37.875 --> 25:39.750
Yeah. Still having a hard time?

25:39.833 --> 25:41.750
Not so much about Tad specifically.

25:41.833 --> 25:44.916
Just about starting
the whole dating nightmare again.

25:46.083 --> 25:48.833
I'm just so ready to be married
and have some kids.

25:48.916 --> 25:51.666
It must be nice
knowing exactly what you want.

25:52.375 --> 25:54.125
Not when it all seems so far away.

25:57.750 --> 25:59.125
So, what's up with you?

26:01.958 --> 26:06.166
Honestly, I just needed a pep talk.
I couldn't really call Hannah.

26:06.250 --> 26:07.916
Because you'd get a lecture instead?

26:08.000 --> 26:09.166
Yeah.

26:09.250 --> 26:12.708
'Cause deep down you know she
knows you better than you know yourself,

26:12.791 --> 26:14.166
and she might just be right?

26:15.291 --> 26:17.125
-Really shitty pep talk.
-Sorry.

26:17.875 --> 26:19.291
What do you need me to say?

26:24.791 --> 26:27.583
I might be in over my head. Might.

26:29.166 --> 26:31.000
-You're always in over your head.
-Yeah.

26:31.083 --> 26:34.791
-It's your operating principle.
-Yeah. I know.

26:36.791 --> 26:39.291
I'm working
this really high-pressure case.

26:39.958 --> 26:44.541
And at the heart of it is...
this person who is really bad news.

26:44.625 --> 26:48.541
But at the same time, there's also
something sympathetic about her.

26:48.625 --> 26:50.583
-Her?
-Yeah.

26:51.500 --> 26:52.750
It's not like that.

26:53.458 --> 26:54.500
It's not.

26:57.708 --> 27:02.083
I'm just saying...
It's good you called me and not Hannah.

27:03.708 --> 27:04.666
Yeah.

27:05.583 --> 27:09.916
I don't know what the hell this case is,
or what you do at work every day,

27:10.000 --> 27:11.208
but I know you.

27:12.250 --> 27:15.000
And I've never met anyone
who has a stronger drive to matter.

27:17.041 --> 27:18.125
Thank you.

27:18.208 --> 27:20.416
I didn't say "make a difference."

27:20.500 --> 27:23.875
You seem to have to constantly prove
that people need you.

27:25.083 --> 27:29.291
It makes you do things that are
reckless and not in your best interests.

27:30.458 --> 27:31.958
So here's my pep talk.

27:33.041 --> 27:34.375
You do matter.

27:37.041 --> 27:38.875
Just ease off the throttle a little.

27:41.958 --> 27:44.291
Give yourself permission
not to be a savior.

27:45.791 --> 27:46.791
Hmm?

27:47.541 --> 27:49.333
Was that peppy enough for you?

28:20.750 --> 28:23.416
Wow, you look different.

28:26.333 --> 28:29.125
-Thanks. Go get us a suite.
-Mm-hm.

28:29.208 --> 28:31.833
No. There's a Days Inn just down the road.

28:31.916 --> 28:34.458
We're wheels up at sunrise.
Don't ask me for first class.

28:34.541 --> 28:38.041
We're hitching a ride on an Air Force
cargo plane to fly under the radar.

28:38.125 --> 28:39.166
-Figuratively.
-Wrong.

28:39.250 --> 28:42.541
We're staying here tonight. You'll help me
with something in the morning.

28:42.625 --> 28:45.500
And we can "wheels up" afterwards.

28:46.583 --> 28:47.708
-No.
-No?

28:47.791 --> 28:50.041
No. I'm not giving in
to your power play anymore.

28:50.125 --> 28:51.916
-That ship has sailed.
-Fine.

28:52.000 --> 28:55.166
Max. Wait. Max. Max. Stop!

28:59.916 --> 29:02.875
Your boss just put you on an airplane
to come down here

29:02.958 --> 29:05.125
and make sure I'm taken care of.
Do you wanna know why?

29:05.208 --> 29:07.750
If you say "leverage,"
I'm gonna run out into traffic.

29:08.416 --> 29:09.625
Leverage.

29:11.208 --> 29:14.541
Come on, don't be like that.
If you just relax, we could have fun.

29:16.666 --> 29:20.333
I'm not here to relax,
or have fun, or play your games.

29:20.958 --> 29:24.458
I can't afford this hotel,
so we are going to the Days Inn.

29:24.541 --> 29:27.250
In today's paper there was an article
about a secret meeting

29:27.333 --> 29:29.666
General Kuznetsov had with the Chinese.

29:29.750 --> 29:32.791
The CIA are desperate to find out
what was talked about.

29:32.875 --> 29:34.875
And I am the only person who can find out.

29:34.958 --> 29:38.583
So stop pretending like you have a choice.
Go get us a suite.

29:52.583 --> 29:55.041
-Hi.
-Welcome to the Phoenix Aurora.

29:55.125 --> 29:56.250
-Checking in?
-Sure.

29:56.333 --> 30:00.041
I have eyes on them. You're right.
There's definitely something going on.

30:00.125 --> 30:01.166
What's happening?

30:01.250 --> 30:05.291
Can we have your cheapest suite
for one night, please?

30:05.375 --> 30:06.416
-Certainly.
-Yeah.

30:06.958 --> 30:10.083
We have a villa available for 1,700.

30:11.583 --> 30:12.416
Dollars?

30:12.500 --> 30:13.708
Yes.

30:16.916 --> 30:17.750
Sure.

30:22.208 --> 30:24.500
He's checking them
into a pricey suite.

30:24.583 --> 30:26.333
I'm sorry, sir, do you have another card?

30:26.416 --> 30:29.458
Or not. There's a problem with his card.

30:29.541 --> 30:31.541
So they're definitely sleeping together.

30:32.833 --> 30:34.458
<i>Just make sure you get pictures.</i>

30:36.875 --> 30:37.750
One second.

30:41.791 --> 30:43.875
.<i>..and so it's third down and five</i>

30:43.958 --> 30:45.625
<i>-inside the red zone...</i>

30:45.708 --> 30:47.458
<i>...from the eight-yard line.</i>

30:47.541 --> 30:50.708
<i>Shotgun formation,</i>
<i>three wide, single back set.</i>

30:51.916 --> 30:54.041
<i>Here's the snap. And he hands off to...</i>

30:55.750 --> 30:57.000
-<i>Hey, what's up?</i>
-Hey.

30:57.083 --> 30:59.791
Um, I need a... favor.

31:00.541 --> 31:02.500
Of course you do. What is it?

31:04.041 --> 31:07.083
Can I put a hotel room
on your credit card?

31:07.166 --> 31:08.583
It's for work. I swear.

31:08.666 --> 31:13.250
<i>Um, I just-- I'm in a tight spot</i>
<i>and my card is full right now.</i>

31:13.333 --> 31:15.625
<i>The agency's still setting up</i>
<i>my direct deposit.</i>

31:15.708 --> 31:16.791
Where are you?

31:16.875 --> 31:18.875
<i>I can't tell you that.</i>

31:18.958 --> 31:20.750
The hotel will be on my statement.

31:22.875 --> 31:23.708
Phoenix.

31:24.416 --> 31:25.291
On a case.

31:25.375 --> 31:27.833
-<i>The same case you said was over?</i>
-Maybe.

31:27.916 --> 31:30.250
You swore all of your work problems
were behind you

31:30.333 --> 31:33.250
right before two men came into
our apartment and whisked you away.

31:33.833 --> 31:35.250
<i>And now you need money?</i>

31:37.083 --> 31:39.625
I know it's not a good look. Okay?

31:39.708 --> 31:42.583
But I wouldn't ask if I wasn't in a jam.

31:43.708 --> 31:44.708
How much is it?

31:44.791 --> 31:48.625
Just a few hundred.
But I will 100 percent pay you back.

31:49.875 --> 31:51.666
Sure. Fine. Whatever.

31:51.750 --> 31:52.666
<i>You owe me.</i>

31:53.833 --> 31:55.083
Amazing. Thank you.

31:55.166 --> 32:00.291
<i>Okay. Well, good.</i>
<i>You wanna give your info to this lady.</i>

32:03.583 --> 32:06.250
Don't tell her how much.
I will tip you extra.

32:10.291 --> 32:11.291
And sent.

32:20.083 --> 32:22.041
This might actually be worth the money.

32:41.625 --> 32:43.625
-I'm gonna take a bath.
-All right.

32:46.458 --> 32:48.875
-Um...
-You wanna join me?

32:50.000 --> 32:52.333
I don't think that's a good idea.

32:52.416 --> 32:53.250
Why not?

32:54.166 --> 32:55.458
You know why.

33:00.375 --> 33:03.750
Hey, I have some fancy body lotions
in there.

33:03.833 --> 33:05.916
-Can you bring them in to me?
-Nope.

33:06.416 --> 33:09.083
Then I guess I'll just have
to come get them myself.

33:09.166 --> 33:10.791
Okay. No. I'll bring it.

33:10.875 --> 33:12.250
What bag?

33:12.958 --> 33:14.000
Turquoise.

33:21.833 --> 33:24.833
Do you think not joining me
makes you a good person?

33:26.875 --> 33:28.000
You're not my type.

33:28.541 --> 33:32.041
Sure. That's the biggest lie
you've told since I've met you.

33:33.875 --> 33:37.208
Why do you have to be so American
about this? Always uptight about sex.

33:37.291 --> 33:38.125
Life is short.

33:38.208 --> 33:41.041
We're both adults. You don't have
to worry about exploiting me.

33:41.125 --> 33:42.833
We could just have fun.

33:43.416 --> 33:44.250
Why am I here?

33:45.333 --> 33:47.708
Because I can't show up
in Belarus empty-handed.

33:47.791 --> 33:51.500
I need cash to pay
for my safe passage back into the Mob.

33:52.250 --> 33:55.000
I need 5 million. Maybe twice that.

33:55.083 --> 33:57.916
Can't the agency give it to you
since you're a hot-shit asset

33:58.000 --> 34:00.416
with your connections
to General Koozy-whatever?

34:00.500 --> 34:01.750
It's not that simple.

34:01.833 --> 34:06.875
Why not? The CIA literally gave backpacks
full of cash out in Afghanistan and Iraq.

34:08.125 --> 34:12.708
Yeah. Well, those missions
were sanctioned at the highest level.

34:12.791 --> 34:14.500
I don't even exist, remember?

34:15.333 --> 34:19.875
Look, trust me, I've done this dance
with the agency for over a decade.

34:19.958 --> 34:22.208
It doesn't matter
how big the intelligence prize.

34:22.291 --> 34:24.750
Their primary mission
is to protect the agency.

34:25.708 --> 34:28.333
They're not going to want
to expose the crimes we did together.

34:29.125 --> 34:32.458
Okay, so we have to pretend
that you're a new recruit, which...

34:33.666 --> 34:36.125
makes authorizing that cash complicated.

34:36.208 --> 34:37.166
Exactly.

34:37.250 --> 34:41.750
So I have to sell my business
before we leave. Pay my own way home.

34:41.833 --> 34:44.083
-Your safe-house business?
-Yes.

34:44.166 --> 34:45.458
Who are you gonna sell it...

34:49.583 --> 34:50.416
to?

34:53.708 --> 34:55.291
Do you want to come dry me off?

34:58.750 --> 34:59.583
No.

35:00.083 --> 35:01.083
Okay, fine.

35:01.166 --> 35:04.000
Then this interrogation is over.
I'm hungry.

35:06.500 --> 35:08.416
We're not ordering room service.

35:09.541 --> 35:10.458
I already did.

35:18.625 --> 35:20.958
You can admit it. This is fun.

35:21.958 --> 35:23.583
I mean, it's not not fun.

35:26.166 --> 35:28.083
Who are you selling your business to?

35:28.166 --> 35:31.833
Ugh. Work, work, work.
Can't we just enjoy tonight?

35:31.916 --> 35:35.041
Get to know each other better?
Tell me more about you.

35:35.125 --> 35:38.791
Well... Why? So you can use it
against me later? No, thank you.

35:39.875 --> 35:44.125
It's a two-way street. I'll answer
your questions if you answer mine.

35:46.958 --> 35:50.583
Okay. Fine. Let's play a game.

35:50.666 --> 35:51.500
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

35:51.583 --> 35:54.000
-Mm.
-A truth for a truth.

35:54.708 --> 35:58.208
Remember what you said. I'm as good a liar
as you, so I will know if you're lying.

35:58.875 --> 36:00.208
-Who goes first?
-I do.

36:01.041 --> 36:03.291
-Who are you selling your business to?
-Ugh.

36:04.333 --> 36:07.875
Talco's boss, Sandoval Luna.
The head of the Aquino Cartel.

36:07.958 --> 36:08.916
Seriously?

36:09.500 --> 36:11.000
Yes. My turn.

36:11.083 --> 36:12.750
Why did you become a lawyer?

36:13.333 --> 36:15.041
It seems very unlike you.

36:15.916 --> 36:18.250
I find the law fascinating.

36:18.958 --> 36:22.041
You better take this seriously,
or I'm not going to play.

36:22.125 --> 36:22.958
Fine. I...

36:24.583 --> 36:26.375
became a lawyer because...

36:30.416 --> 36:34.083
I promised my mom
I wouldn't follow in my father's footsteps

36:34.166 --> 36:36.666
and end up at Arlington National Cemetery.

36:36.750 --> 36:39.125
Mm. You found a loophole
in that promise, huh?

36:39.208 --> 36:41.583
Working at the CIA
has been anything but safe.

36:41.666 --> 36:42.708
Mm-hm.

36:45.000 --> 36:47.666
How did you become an asset at the agency?

36:48.416 --> 36:51.333
A case officer approached me
with kompromat on me.

36:51.416 --> 36:52.416
Not Bob?

36:53.166 --> 36:55.166
Uh, no, the first one.

36:55.250 --> 36:56.083
A drunk.

36:57.333 --> 36:58.166
A woman.

36:59.416 --> 37:00.250
Yes.

37:01.583 --> 37:03.250
Half my handlers were drunk.

37:03.333 --> 37:05.958
It's very difficult
for Westerners to adjust to life in Minsk.

37:06.041 --> 37:08.166
-Mm-hm.
-Although you're holding your own.

37:08.916 --> 37:09.833
Mm-hm.

37:11.750 --> 37:14.916
You said you have had several handlers,

37:15.000 --> 37:17.375
but you've only ever mentioned
Not Bob by name.

37:17.458 --> 37:19.916
-What makes him so special?
-He's Not Bob.

37:21.125 --> 37:24.708
Was he the one that trusted you
to run your network of assets off-book?

37:24.791 --> 37:26.000
No. It's my turn.

37:26.791 --> 37:28.416
Have you ever been in love?

37:31.166 --> 37:33.083
Yeah, I'm not telling you that.

37:33.166 --> 37:34.333
-That was a yes.
-No.

37:34.416 --> 37:36.166
-Yeah. The girl from social media.
-No.

37:36.250 --> 37:38.708
-From law school. Your roommate.
-Maybe.

37:38.791 --> 37:40.791
-Have you ever loved someone?
-Yes.

37:43.416 --> 37:44.250
Who?

37:47.625 --> 37:48.458
My daughter.

37:51.125 --> 37:53.583
I didn't know that you are a mom.

37:56.666 --> 37:57.750
I was.

38:04.333 --> 38:05.333
Um...

38:06.166 --> 38:07.875
I'm so sorry. I, uh...

38:10.125 --> 38:11.625
What happened?

38:12.750 --> 38:15.000
Uh, what always happens eventually.

38:16.416 --> 38:17.625
Tragedy.

38:22.333 --> 38:26.166
So tomorrow,
you'll help me negotiate the sale.

38:26.250 --> 38:30.000
And we can wheels up,
and I get to go home.

38:32.125 --> 38:32.958
Yeah.

38:36.750 --> 38:39.166
Why did you bring me down here?

38:41.250 --> 38:42.083
The truth.

38:45.916 --> 38:49.291
Because you're the only person
I've ever been able to count on.

38:58.958 --> 38:59.958
I'm going to bed.

39:01.833 --> 39:02.750
You wanna come?

39:08.000 --> 39:08.833
No.

39:12.500 --> 39:13.333
Okay.

39:16.166 --> 39:17.833
-Good night.
-Good night.

39:56.583 --> 39:57.708
Jeff bought you flowers?

39:58.625 --> 39:59.583
Owen did.

40:00.500 --> 40:04.083
"I send flowers now
and no one deserves them more than you."

40:04.166 --> 40:05.000
Why?

40:06.208 --> 40:07.458
I did him a favor.

40:52.916 --> 40:55.666
<i>You said a few hundred, not 3,000.</i>

40:55.750 --> 40:58.125
<i>And don't think sending me flowers</i>
<i>makes this all better.</i>

40:58.208 --> 41:00.750
The only reason
why cops aren't banging down your door

41:00.833 --> 41:03.125
is I don't really know
if you're on a secret work thing.

41:04.083 --> 41:05.750
What kind of flowers?

41:08.625 --> 41:11.000
-Where is Owen?
-<i>He's in the shower.</i>

41:11.083 --> 41:12.791
<i>You don't sound like--</i>

41:12.875 --> 41:14.083
Like who?

41:14.750 --> 41:15.791
Never mind.

41:16.458 --> 41:17.500
What's going on?

41:17.583 --> 41:18.791
<i>Are you Hannah?</i>

41:19.666 --> 41:21.625
<i>The rich girl from his Instagram?</i>

41:22.625 --> 41:25.375
He told me last night
you were the one who got away.

41:25.458 --> 41:26.416
No, he didn't.

41:26.500 --> 41:27.333
<i>He did.</i>

41:30.500 --> 41:34.583
You tell Owen he's my unpaid intern
for the next six months.

41:34.666 --> 41:37.541
-Have you seen my clothes anywhere?

41:38.750 --> 41:40.125
Yeah, I threw them out.

41:40.750 --> 41:41.708
What? Why?

41:41.791 --> 41:44.041
I went shopping and I bought you new ones

41:44.125 --> 41:46.041
more appropriate
for the work we're about to do.

41:46.125 --> 41:47.166
Wha--?

41:58.875 --> 42:00.458
Uh, who was on the phone?

42:01.416 --> 42:02.541
Hannah.

42:02.625 --> 42:05.041
What? What did you say to her?

42:05.125 --> 42:08.125
I couldn't get a word in edgewise.
She was very mad.

42:08.875 --> 42:10.708
Are you sure you wanna do that?

42:13.416 --> 42:14.291
Ugh.

42:15.583 --> 42:18.416
-You need to cut him off.
-The card? I did.

42:19.375 --> 42:20.208
All of it.

42:21.500 --> 42:23.208
-Yeah, but--
-But-- But what?

42:25.375 --> 42:26.208
Never mind.

42:26.708 --> 42:29.375
I can't let him derail me
like he always does.

42:29.458 --> 42:30.583
I need to focus.

42:30.666 --> 42:32.916
This discovery demand
isn't going to write itself.

42:33.000 --> 42:35.916
-Well, that's the spirit.
-Can I have another one?

42:37.125 --> 42:39.750
-Are you eating your feelings?
-No.

42:44.250 --> 42:45.083
Thank you.

42:55.541 --> 42:57.958
Any more aspects of my life
you would like to fuck up?

42:58.041 --> 43:00.833
Oh, don't be a baby. You need to get
your head on straight for today.

43:00.916 --> 43:02.041
This could be dangerous.

43:02.125 --> 43:03.500
Put that on under your jacket.

43:03.583 --> 43:05.125
-No. I don't want to.
-Fine.

43:05.208 --> 43:06.916
They usually aim for your head anyway.

43:08.000 --> 43:09.458
-I'm joking.
-Jesus.

43:10.000 --> 43:11.541
There shouldn't be any violence.

43:11.625 --> 43:13.958
They want what I'm selling
too badly to fuck it up.

43:14.041 --> 43:16.666
Quick, on the TV.
One of those men is Not Bob. Which one?

43:20.583 --> 43:22.250
What? Is this a joke?

43:24.125 --> 43:26.125
You don't recognize any of them, do you?

43:27.875 --> 43:30.958
That means you never met Not Bob.
Means he wasn't one of your handlers.

43:31.041 --> 43:32.625
Where did you hear that nickname?

43:35.541 --> 43:37.666
Okay. Fine. But a truth for a truth?

43:37.750 --> 43:39.458
Forget it. I earned this one.

43:45.375 --> 43:47.041
Xander Goi told me the name.

43:48.666 --> 43:49.500
Why?

43:50.083 --> 43:52.250
He was drunk. Hero worshipping.

43:52.791 --> 43:55.791
At an agency where secrecy is king
and everybody knows Not Bob,

43:55.875 --> 43:57.458
he wanted to be that guy.

43:59.000 --> 43:59.833
But he's not.

44:03.333 --> 44:05.041
Come. We're going to be late.

44:09.083 --> 44:11.958
Two wolves.
But three wolves? Nah.

44:12.041 --> 44:13.333
Lester Kitchens.

44:14.875 --> 44:17.791
I heard you went to work
for the enemy, but I didn't believe it.

44:17.875 --> 44:21.166
Yeah, well, I guess
I wanted a job with a future.

44:21.666 --> 44:23.750
Plus, I get to sleep in my own bed.

44:24.458 --> 44:25.875
You remember Violet Ebner?

44:25.958 --> 44:27.958
She was a JAG at Delaram
when we were there.

44:28.041 --> 44:28.916
Right.

44:29.000 --> 44:30.833
You're with OGC too now.

44:30.916 --> 44:32.333
Yeah, about a year.

44:33.166 --> 44:36.416
I joined up with Lester.
So, what are you doing here?

44:36.958 --> 44:40.916
Working on re-inserting an asset.
It's a little complicated.

44:42.208 --> 44:47.083
-Is this Hendricks' graymail?
-Yeah, what can you tell me about him?

44:48.291 --> 44:49.333
No.

44:53.958 --> 44:57.083
You know, he plays an idiot,
but it's all an act.

44:57.166 --> 44:59.041
The kid's a chaos agent, not a lawyer.

44:59.125 --> 45:02.375
And if I were you,
I wouldn't let him near my operation.

45:15.333 --> 45:16.666
-Stop touching me.
-No.

45:16.750 --> 45:19.208
-Stop. What are you doing?
-I need to track your phone.

45:21.541 --> 45:25.583
-Why would you need to track me?
-Because you're going in alone.

45:25.666 --> 45:27.416
Did I forget to mention that?

45:28.041 --> 45:30.083
Uh-- Yeah.

45:31.041 --> 45:34.291
Talco tried to kill me yesterday
for my source.

45:34.375 --> 45:37.083
The person at the bank
who feeds me foreclosure homes.

45:37.166 --> 45:40.041
-So he wouldn't have to pay.
-And that's why you needed me here.

45:40.125 --> 45:41.916
But he won't play games with you.

45:42.000 --> 45:43.791
Because I will be standing by,

45:43.875 --> 45:46.625
ready to kill that source
if they betray you.

45:47.583 --> 45:49.750
Which they won't,
because they will end up with nothing.

45:49.833 --> 45:50.875
-No.
-Owen.

45:50.958 --> 45:52.958
No, you're not killing the source.

45:53.041 --> 45:54.166
Agree or I walk.

45:57.375 --> 45:59.208
Fine. I won't kill her,

45:59.291 --> 46:02.375
but you tell them that I will,
and they will believe you.

46:02.458 --> 46:05.333
Her name is Zuri Wench, Sun City Bank.

46:12.708 --> 46:15.375
You walk two blocks north,
three blocks west.

46:15.458 --> 46:17.958
Talco will be there.
He'll pick you up. You do the deal.

46:21.833 --> 46:22.666
Please.

46:26.083 --> 46:28.166
It's the only way I get to go home.

47:31.333 --> 47:32.708
Enemy of my enemy.

47:34.000 --> 47:34.833
Yeah.

47:35.916 --> 47:38.833
Look, I'm just here
as a proxy to negotiate

47:38.916 --> 47:41.291
the terms of the sale of Max's business.

47:42.208 --> 47:45.291
Good for you. Have a seat.
We got some driving to do.

47:45.375 --> 47:47.458
What, we can't just negotiate here?

47:48.750 --> 47:52.500
You're not making a deal with me.
You're making it with El Jefe.
