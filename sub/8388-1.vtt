this film was certified 15

00:05.630 --> 00:07.715
by the Board of Classification

00:07.799 --> 00:09.675
due to "scenes of severe violence,

00:09.759 --> 00:12.094
"making it unsuitable for those

00:12.178 --> 00:15.889
"ofjunior high school age and under",

00:15.974 --> 00:19.351

BATTLE ROYALE
SPEClAL EDlTlON 2001

01:06.399 --> 01:11.445
At the dawn of the millennium,
the nation collapsed.

01:11.529 --> 01:17.576
At 15% unemployment,
10 million were out ofwork.

01:17.660 --> 01:24.041
800,000 students boycotted school
and juvenile crime rates soared.

01:24.125 --> 01:28.128
Adults had lost all confidence,
and now fearing the youth

01:28.213 --> 01:32.674
they eventually passed
the Millennium Educational Reform Act.

01:34.260 --> 01:37.554
AKA: the BR Act.

01:41.851 --> 01:46.480
This year Zentsuji Middle School's
Class E was chosen

01:46.564 --> 01:49.983
from among 43,000 9th grade classes.

01:50.068 --> 01:54.321
This year's game was
even more blistering than the last.

01:54.405 --> 01:57.032
Look, there she is!

01:57.117 --> 01:59.493
The winner is a girl!

02:00.495 --> 02:05.833
Surviving a battle that raged
for 2 days, 7 hours and 43 minutes,

02:05.917 --> 02:08.252
the winner is a girl!

02:08.336 --> 02:11.338
Look, she's smiling! Smiling!

02:11.422 --> 02:13.757
That's clearly a smile!

02:44.164 --> 02:47.457
My mum left when I was in 4th grade,

02:47.542 --> 02:49.626
and on my first day of 7th grade,

02:49.711 --> 02:52.963
Dad hung himself.

03:03.558 --> 03:07.019
"Go Shuya!
You can do it, Shuya!"

03:19.240 --> 03:21.325
Everything went totally crazy.

03:22.410 --> 03:27.915
I didn't have a clue what to do
and no one else helped me.

03:29.292 --> 03:31.877
- Good morning.
- What?

03:34.255 --> 03:38.926
Sorry, l'm late...
What's going on?

03:39.010 --> 03:42.054
"TAKlN' THE DAY OFF
'CAUSE WE WANT TO - CLASS B"

04:27.308 --> 04:31.395
Soon after,
this particular teacher left the school.

04:35.733 --> 04:39.528
But no matter how crazy
the world became,

04:40.029 --> 04:43.657
we all managed to have fun.

05:03.803 --> 05:09.057
Before we knew it, our compulsory
education was coming to an end.

05:25.575 --> 05:28.618
- Teacher!
- Sorry!

05:30.830 --> 05:32.706
- Let's go.
- No...

05:32.790 --> 05:34.666
Come on, let's go.

05:34.751 --> 05:37.294
Sorry, let us through.

05:38.338 --> 05:42.716
Nanahara, l've made some cookies.
l thought l could share them out.

05:42.800 --> 05:45.927
- Would you like some, Nobu?
- Really? Thanks!

05:46.012 --> 05:48.388
- Look over here.
- OK.

05:48.473 --> 05:50.140
Say "cheese"!

05:51.434 --> 05:54.269
Noriko's been waiting ages
to give them to you.

05:54.354 --> 05:58.065
- Megumi!
- Shuya, you have some too.

05:58.149 --> 06:00.192
l'm fine. You eat them, Nobu.

06:00.276 --> 06:04.446
Nakagawa, you know what...?
l'm glad l came.

06:04.530 --> 06:06.990
- Thanks.
- Don't mention it, Nobu.

06:07.075 --> 06:10.077
- The picture is ready!
- l'm hardly in it!

07:54.682 --> 07:56.516
Hey, Nakagawa!

08:02.356 --> 08:04.900
- Nobu.
- Huh? What...?

09:51.382 --> 09:53.008
After you.

10:05.354 --> 10:07.480
- Kitano!
- Kitano?

10:07.565 --> 10:10.108
Can't be...!

10:10.860 --> 10:14.195
- OK, sit down.
- Sit down!

10:20.870 --> 10:22.829
lt's been a while.

10:22.913 --> 10:26.207
lt's me, Kitano,
your teacher from back in 7th Grade.

10:26.292 --> 10:31.046
l'm taking Class B over again.
Let's all be friends.

10:32.256 --> 10:36.509
Two transfer students are joining us
from today. That's Kawada over there.

10:37.470 --> 10:40.096
And Kiriyama over there.

10:41.057 --> 10:43.016
Be nice to them.

THE BR ACT

10:48.689 --> 10:50.774
Hey, don't mess about.
What is this place?

10:50.858 --> 10:52.525
Where the hell are we?

10:52.610 --> 10:55.445
Who are these people?

10:55.529 --> 10:57.947
Do you know about this law?

11:03.704 --> 11:06.414
No good. Not good at all.

11:07.875 --> 11:12.253
This country is now good for nothing.
Want to know why?

11:12.338 --> 11:14.756
l said no whispering!

11:15.800 --> 11:17.884
That hurt!

11:18.928 --> 11:22.263
When someone's talking,
shut up and listen.

11:23.683 --> 11:26.101
Can l go to the bathroom?

11:27.520 --> 11:30.063
Chigusa, can you wait a little?

11:30.815 --> 11:33.108
l missed you guys.

11:36.779 --> 11:38.780
Kuninobu.

11:39.699 --> 11:41.574
You really hurt my ass.

11:43.077 --> 11:48.206
l told you not to bother with school,
didn't l? That you were a lost cause.

11:48.290 --> 11:52.210
But then you really did
just stop going to school!

11:52.920 --> 11:54.587
That's no good.

11:56.132 --> 12:03.012
And now you come back
just for the class trip!

12:08.144 --> 12:10.186
Listen up!

12:10.271 --> 12:13.690
Because of folks like Kuninobu here,

12:14.734 --> 12:17.110
this country is now a total wreck.

12:17.194 --> 12:22.282
So the bigwigs got together
and passed this law:

12:23.617 --> 12:25.368
Battle Royale.

12:26.495 --> 12:30.832
So today's lesson is
you kill each other off...

12:32.084 --> 12:36.379
...till there's only one of you left.
Nothing is against the rules.

12:38.758 --> 12:41.259
What's so funny?

12:41.343 --> 12:43.553
Teacher...

12:43.721 --> 12:47.891
What are you talking about?
This can't possibly...

12:49.351 --> 12:57.400
Your teacher, Mr Hayashida, was very
opposed to the selection of Class B.

13:03.616 --> 13:05.492
Calm down.

13:05.576 --> 13:08.536
We have here a failure as an adult.

13:08.621 --> 13:11.623
Be careful that you don't become
an adult like him.

13:14.001 --> 13:18.797
Time to watch the video.
Don't fall asleep now.

13:18.881 --> 13:21.049
The Correct Way to Fight
in Battle Royale

13:21.133 --> 13:23.927
By the BR Law Promotion Committee

13:24.011 --> 13:27.555
Hello to everyone in Shiroiwa
Junior High School, 9th Grade Class B.

13:27.640 --> 13:30.141
Everyone, say hello!

13:30.226 --> 13:35.480
You are the lucky class chosen
for this year's Battle Royale!

13:35.564 --> 13:38.274
- Congratulations!
- Thank you!

13:38.359 --> 13:41.694
Now l'm going to explain the rules.

13:42.321 --> 13:46.157
Listen carefully,
then fight correctly and with energy.

13:46.242 --> 13:50.703
You have all been brought
to this uninhabited island.

13:50.788 --> 13:56.668
lt's about 10km in diameter, but we
evacuated everyone, so it's deserted.

13:57.920 --> 14:00.338
Fujiyoshi, l said no whispering!

14:08.430 --> 14:10.557
All right, move, move.

14:15.020 --> 14:18.982
Sorry, it's against the rules
for me to kill, isn't it?

14:20.109 --> 14:24.529
Girl #18 Fujiyoshi - dead
41 to go

14:45.301 --> 14:47.802
Noriko!

14:48.304 --> 14:50.388
- Asshole!
- Nobu!

14:55.352 --> 14:57.186
Nobu!

14:59.064 --> 15:00.899
Shit!

15:04.862 --> 15:07.363
Right! Back to the video!

15:07.865 --> 15:10.825
This island has been divided
into all these little areas.

15:10.910 --> 15:15.288
Your teacher will make announcements
at 12:00 and 6:00 am and pm.

15:15.372 --> 15:17.165
Four times a day!

15:17.249 --> 15:22.253
These will tell you which areas are going
to be dangerous and from what time.

15:22.338 --> 15:26.090
lf you are in one of the areas, move!

15:26.175 --> 15:28.301
You want to know why?

15:28.385 --> 15:32.263
That's where these necklaces
we have you wearing come into it!

15:32.348 --> 15:36.059
They are completely
water and shock proof...

15:36.143 --> 15:38.269
And there's no way to get them off.

15:38.354 --> 15:42.190
This sensor monitors your pulse,

15:42.274 --> 15:45.777
telling us exactly where you are
and what you're doing.

15:45.861 --> 15:49.197
lf you're still in a danger area
when the time runs out

15:49.281 --> 15:54.619
or are doing something naughty,
we will send our own signal to you!

15:54.703 --> 15:58.206
The necklace will sound an alarm
and then... boom!

15:58.707 --> 16:00.416
lt will explode!

16:00.501 --> 16:05.755
Trying to force it offwill also make
it explode. Don't even try it, OK?

16:06.799 --> 16:08.341
You assholes!

16:08.425 --> 16:10.802
- Shut up!
- We can't hear the video.

16:10.886 --> 16:13.096
Cut it out, Nobu!

16:16.642 --> 16:18.393
Cut it out! Quiet!

16:21.981 --> 16:24.440
There's no helping you, is there...?

16:31.281 --> 16:34.784
- Better run, guys.
- What is this?!

16:41.959 --> 16:43.668
Help me!

16:51.093 --> 16:53.177
- Shuya!
- Nobu!

17:14.366 --> 17:15.825
Nobu...

17:28.255 --> 17:32.175
Hey, Shuya, do you
have a crush on anyone right now?

17:32.968 --> 17:37.055
Boy #7 Kuninobu - dead
40 to go

17:52.362 --> 17:54.238
What a shame.

17:54.782 --> 17:57.784
l liked the kid, in my own way.

18:05.209 --> 18:07.960
What's that look for, Nanahara?

18:20.224 --> 18:23.309
Ah, something else l need to tell you.

18:23.393 --> 18:27.063
This game has a time limit. Three days.

18:27.147 --> 18:30.108
lf a single survivor
isn't determined in that time

18:30.192 --> 18:33.069
all the necklaces
will automatically explode!

18:33.153 --> 18:35.613
No one will win!

18:35.697 --> 18:38.825
So you may as well fight
as hard as you can

18:38.909 --> 18:41.661
and make sure
that doesn't happen, OK?

18:42.037 --> 18:44.705
OK, any questions so far?

18:44.790 --> 18:46.249
Yes.

18:46.333 --> 18:48.584
Yes, Motobuchi.

18:48.669 --> 18:52.296
lf l survive can l go home?

18:54.299 --> 18:58.344
Sure, but only
if everyone else is dead.

19:00.639 --> 19:03.224
- Yes.
- Yeah, Mimura.

19:03.308 --> 19:05.351
How were we chosen?

19:05.435 --> 19:08.896
By random selection.

19:08.981 --> 19:11.774
- One more?
- Sure.

19:12.442 --> 19:14.861
Why are you doing this?

19:14.945 --> 19:17.738
lt's your own damned fault.

19:18.949 --> 19:20.992
You don't respect adults, do you?

19:22.119 --> 19:27.206
That's fine, if you like.
But don't forget.

19:27.916 --> 19:30.543
Life is a game.

19:30.627 --> 19:36.757
So fight for survival...
and find out if you're worth it.

19:53.192 --> 19:56.611
Now you're going to leave
the classroom one by one.

19:56.695 --> 20:01.449
But before that you'll be given a bag.
lnside is food and water.

20:01.533 --> 20:08.372
A map, compass, flashlight
and weapon. Check it for yourself later.

20:08.457 --> 20:12.501
This one is for the girls - you can take
your personal stuffwith you, too!

20:12.586 --> 20:17.548
Each bag contains a different weapon.
Not everyone will get a gun or knife!

20:17.633 --> 20:20.927
lt's random, with some good
and some not so good at all!

20:21.011 --> 20:24.263
This will give everyone
a fighting chance.

20:26.058 --> 20:28.309
Wow! Someone got lucky with this one!

20:29.144 --> 20:32.939
We've notified your parents.
Just go for it!

20:33.023 --> 20:36.984
OK, you'll be leaving
by class number.

20:37.069 --> 20:42.406
When l call your name,
l want to hear a nice big "here"!

20:43.242 --> 20:46.535
Boy #1 Akamatsu.

20:46.620 --> 20:48.204
Here!

20:55.212 --> 20:59.674
The Game Begins
Day One - 1 :40am

20:59.758 --> 21:02.468
- Girl #1 lnada.

21:05.055 --> 21:07.765
- We'll always be friends.

21:12.854 --> 21:15.356
Boy #2 lijima.

21:23.782 --> 21:25.866
Girl #2 Utsumi.

21:34.960 --> 21:38.671
Boy #3 Oki.

21:44.803 --> 21:47.972
Girl #3 Eto.

21:48.974 --> 21:51.726
- l'm going, Noriko.
- Megumi...

21:56.023 --> 21:59.066
Boy #4 Oda.

22:08.410 --> 22:11.579
Girl #4 Ogawa.

22:24.926 --> 22:27.094
Boy #5 Kawada.

22:28.889 --> 22:30.514
Kawada!

22:35.854 --> 22:38.939
Girl #5 Kanai.

22:42.778 --> 22:45.946
Boy #6 Kiriyama.

22:51.453 --> 22:53.329
On the double!

22:58.293 --> 23:00.169
That's my bag.

23:00.253 --> 23:02.338
What the...?

23:03.298 --> 23:08.552
You probably guessed, but our new
transfers are a little dangerous.

23:19.022 --> 23:21.857
Girl #14 Tendo.

23:27.447 --> 23:30.533
Boy #15 Nanahara.

23:30.742 --> 23:32.701
Nanahara!

23:39.167 --> 23:41.627
l'll wait for you...

24:09.197 --> 24:10.656
Nanahara...

24:12.367 --> 24:14.076
What happened...?

24:14.161 --> 24:19.582
What am l going to do...?
What is this...?

24:19.666 --> 24:21.292
Tendo!

24:33.013 --> 24:35.598
Don't, Nakagawa!

24:42.022 --> 24:44.607
Shit, what am l doing?

24:47.068 --> 24:49.737
What are you doing...?

24:52.115 --> 24:54.200
ls this yours?

25:00.248 --> 25:01.999
No way...!

25:04.503 --> 25:08.088
Boy #1 Akamatsu,
Girl #14 Tendo - dead

25:08.173 --> 25:08.881
38 to go

25:19.017 --> 25:21.143
- ls your arm OK?
- l just had to get out of there.

25:21.228 --> 25:22.937
Show it to me.

25:25.982 --> 25:29.568
lt's just a scratch.
l'll wash off the blood.

25:31.571 --> 25:35.115
What's this?
l can't fight with a pot lid!

25:36.409 --> 25:39.620
This is mine...

25:39.704 --> 25:42.331
Those bastards... Goddamn it!

25:42.415 --> 25:46.669
Maybe Mimura and Sugimura
and us could all escape.

25:46.753 --> 25:49.088
- l don't think so.
- Why not?

25:50.048 --> 25:52.633
You won't like me for saying this

25:53.093 --> 25:57.054
but l don't trust any of them either.

25:57.889 --> 26:01.267
Noriko, Noriko!
Shorty, ugly, die!

26:11.236 --> 26:13.195
"Noriko, shorty, ugly, die!"

26:13.280 --> 26:15.990
- What about me?
- What?

26:16.074 --> 26:18.200
Are you scared of me too?

26:20.120 --> 26:24.582
You're the only one l trust, Shuya.
Oh, l'm sorry.

26:24.666 --> 26:26.458
Why?

26:26.543 --> 26:29.545
l called you Shuya, just like Nobu...

26:35.010 --> 26:36.760
Nobu...

26:41.057 --> 26:43.517
Hey, Shuya?

26:47.105 --> 26:50.899
Do you have a crush
on anyone at the moment?

26:50.984 --> 26:53.444
Why? Do you?

26:55.280 --> 27:00.034
Maybe l kind of like someone...

27:00.118 --> 27:02.202
Who?

27:03.622 --> 27:05.664
Noriko Nakagawa.

27:07.959 --> 27:10.753
- From our class?
- Yeah.

27:12.047 --> 27:15.382
Yeah, she's nice.

27:15.467 --> 27:18.010
You agree?

27:20.889 --> 27:24.308
She's really sweet.

27:26.353 --> 27:31.815
She wrote to me saying,
"Come back to school.

27:33.526 --> 27:37.154
"Let's all go
on the school trip together."

27:38.907 --> 27:41.367
Even if she didn't really mean it...

27:43.078 --> 27:45.954
lt's nice to have someone
waiting for you.

27:46.039 --> 27:51.126
We were roommates
in the foster home after Dad died.

27:52.212 --> 27:55.798
When l was depressed
after l quit baseball

27:55.882 --> 27:58.384
he taught me the guitar.

28:00.387 --> 28:02.471
l had to invite him...

28:02.555 --> 28:05.974
No, he was happy he came back.

28:07.394 --> 28:09.186
Really happy...

28:10.522 --> 28:14.608
But l couldn't help Nobu either.

28:16.277 --> 28:20.364
He needed my help
but l couldn't do a thing.

28:25.245 --> 28:29.623
l can't give this up.
l'll take revenge for him.

28:30.834 --> 28:35.045
l'll protect you right to the end,
just like he would have done.

28:36.256 --> 28:40.217
Thank you... Nanahara.

28:43.012 --> 28:49.143
You never got to taste
those cookies, did you?

29:05.160 --> 29:07.995
Numai's gang took Kiriyama.

29:13.460 --> 29:16.253
They're not wasting any time.

29:44.991 --> 29:46.658
What's this?

29:46.743 --> 29:48.911
You got a good one!

29:49.829 --> 29:53.040
Some transfer student!
Are you in this together with Kitano?

29:53.625 --> 29:58.629
- Going to make us kill each other.
- None of us is killing anyone.

29:58.713 --> 30:01.423
You might as well come clean now.

30:01.508 --> 30:03.467
Are you listening?

30:05.678 --> 30:07.763
Asshole!

30:15.772 --> 30:18.065
Why? Stop...

30:41.506 --> 30:45.676
Boys #9 Kuronaga, #10 Sasagawa,
#14 Tsukioka, #1 7 Numai,

30:45.760 --> 30:47.761
Girl #5 Kanai - dead
33 to go

31:13.705 --> 31:17.749
l'm sorry, Sakura.
l'm not much help, am l?

31:17.834 --> 31:21.712
No, l'm grateful you came with me.

31:22.755 --> 31:24.965
What will happen to us?

31:25.049 --> 31:27.217
- l know one thing.
- What?

31:28.094 --> 31:32.055
l'll never play this game.

31:38.730 --> 31:40.814
Maybe someone will save us!

31:43.902 --> 31:45.611
No.

31:48.615 --> 31:50.407
Let's go.

32:00.543 --> 32:02.210
Here goes...

32:03.796 --> 32:06.465
Boy #21 Yamamoto,
Girl #4 Ogawa - dead

32:06.549 --> 32:08.216
31 to go

32:26.736 --> 32:28.695
Mimura...

32:37.455 --> 32:39.373
Who's there?

32:40.833 --> 32:43.168
Oh, it's you, Megumi.

32:43.252 --> 32:45.587
Who is it?

32:50.426 --> 32:52.594
Mitsuko...

32:52.679 --> 32:55.806
Were you going to kill me
with that stun gun?

32:55.890 --> 32:58.809
What...? Oh, l'm sorry.

32:58.893 --> 33:04.731
l was never friendly with your group,
but you're OK.

33:04.816 --> 33:08.318
- So l can come in?
- Sure, come in.

33:16.577 --> 33:19.121
Pictures of Mimura.

33:19.205 --> 33:21.540
Oh, no...!

33:22.834 --> 33:25.585
ls this your weapon?

33:25.670 --> 33:28.046
Not much use, huh?

33:28.131 --> 33:30.382
Not necessarily.

33:30.466 --> 33:34.845
One zap at someone with a bad heart
and they'll pretty much be a goner.

33:34.929 --> 33:37.055
Have you used one before?

33:38.766 --> 33:40.642
Of course not, sorry!

33:42.270 --> 33:43.937
Here.

33:44.022 --> 33:46.481
Mitsuko! Don't!

33:52.613 --> 33:57.367
This is my weapon.
l thought it was so-so.

33:57.452 --> 34:00.078
But actually it's not so bad.

34:00.872 --> 34:04.541
l found Yoshimi and Kuramoto
dead next door.

34:04.625 --> 34:07.210
Strung up all cosy together.

34:07.295 --> 34:09.463
Not my scene!

34:09.547 --> 34:11.840
l'll never die like that!

34:13.676 --> 34:16.344
Girls #3 Megumi, #21 Yoshimi,
Boy #8 Kuramoto - dead

34:16.429 --> 34:18.096
28 to go

34:44.748 --> 34:49.168
First Report 6:00am

34:49.253 --> 34:54.632
lt's now 6:00am.
Time for sleepyheads to wake up!

34:56.552 --> 35:00.889
Here's the list of your dead friends
in the order they died.

35:03.684 --> 35:06.561
Girl #14 Tendo.

35:07.313 --> 35:09.981
Boys #1 Akamatsu,

35:10.066 --> 35:14.069

35:14.153 --> 35:18.573
#14 Tsukioka, #17 Numai.

35:18.658 --> 35:21.034
Girl #5 Kanai.

35:21.119 --> 35:25.956

35:28.501 --> 35:33.588
Girls #21 Yoshimi, #3 Megumi.

35:33.673 --> 35:35.298
Megumi...

35:35.383 --> 35:38.301
No... why?

35:38.386 --> 35:40.470
Now, the danger zones.

35:40.555 --> 35:45.100
I'll read off zones and times,
so check your maps.

35:45.184 --> 35:50.856
Listen up! Starting at 7:00, B-5.
That's B-5.

35:50.940 --> 35:53.942
Next, at 9:00, E-8.

35:54.152 --> 35:56.695
Then at 1 1 :00, F-2. Got that?

35:58.739 --> 36:05.537
lt's tough when friends die on you,
but hang in there! We'll talk again soon!

36:08.499 --> 36:11.042
- Nakagawa.
- Megumi...

36:11.127 --> 36:12.961
This is going to be a danger zone.

36:13.045 --> 36:15.505
We've got to head south, quick.

36:34.817 --> 36:36.276
Oki?

36:36.861 --> 36:39.404
l'll get you! l'll get you!

37:03.679 --> 37:05.597
Oki...

37:13.189 --> 37:15.941
Are you OK?

37:16.025 --> 37:19.027
l'm sorry.
l'm fine, l'm fine...

37:26.118 --> 37:27.702
Nanahara!

37:27.787 --> 37:32.374
Did l kill him? Tell me the truth.
You were watching.

37:32.458 --> 37:35.585
- Did l?
- lt was an accident.

37:37.004 --> 37:43.468
X = -b over 2a...
No, b squared minus 4ac.

37:43.552 --> 37:46.429
Everybody's serious, huh? Fine.

37:46.514 --> 37:49.641
l'll survive
and get into a good school.

37:49.725 --> 37:51.518
Stop it!

37:57.900 --> 38:00.068
Don't try and stop me!

38:10.413 --> 38:12.872
What weapons have you got?

38:12.957 --> 38:16.501
- A pot lid.
- And binoculars.

38:24.677 --> 38:28.471
Everybody! Stop fighting!

38:28.556 --> 38:31.516
Please hear us out!

38:32.143 --> 38:39.107
This is Kusaka, with Yukiko,
on the cliffs of the north mountain.

38:39.191 --> 38:43.653
Everybody come here.
We'll figure this out together.

38:43.738 --> 38:48.241
We don't want to fight.
Right, Yukiko?

38:49.118 --> 38:53.288
This is Yukiko! Please join us.

38:53.372 --> 38:56.458
Let's think this through together.

38:56.542 --> 38:58.626
That's the right tactic.

38:58.711 --> 39:00.962
- Where are you going?
- To go and get them.

39:01.047 --> 39:02.756
You don't even have a weapon!

39:02.840 --> 39:05.258
Not everyone
wants to play nice out there!

39:11.140 --> 39:13.725
lf they're in danger
then all the more reason to go!

39:19.648 --> 39:21.358
No!

39:21.442 --> 39:23.943
Stop shooting!

39:24.904 --> 39:28.073
- ldiots!
- Run!

39:28.157 --> 39:32.619
- That's...
- Nanahara? That was his voice, right?

39:32.703 --> 39:37.165
Nanahara!
Over here, come here!

39:37.249 --> 39:40.043
Yukiko's always had a crush on...

39:40.127 --> 39:41.878
You idiot...

40:17.456 --> 40:18.998
Kusaka!

40:19.792 --> 40:22.877
Kusaka!
Yukiko!

40:23.712 --> 40:28.091
Tell me it's not true!
Answer me! Kusaka!

40:28.175 --> 40:30.510
He'll come here next. Let's move.

40:30.594 --> 40:34.764
Go wherever you like...
You're a murderer yourself!

40:34.849 --> 40:37.851
- Nanahara...
- They were my friends!

40:38.602 --> 40:43.356
This is crazy! How can you all
kill each other so easily?

40:43.441 --> 40:46.484
There's a way out of this game.

40:47.236 --> 40:50.155
Commit suicide, both of you.
Here, now.

40:50.239 --> 40:55.326
lf you can't do that
then stop trusting anyone and just run.

40:58.956 --> 41:01.124
Boys #3 Oki, #20 Motobuchi,
Girl #6 Yukiko, #7 Kusaka - dead

41:01.208 --> 41:02.667
24 to go

41:30.821 --> 41:34.991
Second Report - 12:00pm

41:38.454 --> 41:42.624
lt's noon.
Are you all getting hungry?

41:42.708 --> 41:46.085
Take a little lunch break from killing.

41:46.170 --> 41:50.131
Now for the list of those
who went down this morning.

41:51.008 --> 41:54.010
Boy #3 Oki.

41:54.094 --> 41:56.638
Boy #20 Motobuchi.

41:56.722 --> 42:00.975
Girls #6 Yukiko, #7 Kusaka.

42:01.060 --> 42:02.852
Four in total.

42:02.937 --> 42:07.357
Calling for peace was a good idea.
But you can't have them all.

42:07.441 --> 42:11.653
Now for the danger zones and hours.

42:11.737 --> 42:15.782
An hourfrom now at 13:00, l-4.

42:15.866 --> 42:19.077
Then from 1 5:00, E-9.

42:19.161 --> 42:22.330
From 17:00, F-1 ...

42:34.593 --> 42:36.177
Mitsuko...

42:36.262 --> 42:38.304
Hirono.

42:38.389 --> 42:42.058
Oh, great.
l finally found you.

42:44.103 --> 42:46.604
ls this your weapon, Mitsuko?

42:46.689 --> 42:50.733
- Yeah.
- Kind of lame, huh?

42:52.736 --> 42:56.364
Yoshimi's dead, isn't she?

42:56.448 --> 43:00.577
- With Kuramoto.
- So you saw.

43:00.661 --> 43:05.498
Well, l saw Megumi's throat slit.

43:06.500 --> 43:09.377
With a sickle or something.

43:10.629 --> 43:14.674
Mitsuko!
Have you got Megumi's weapon?

43:14.758 --> 43:16.092
Of course not.

43:16.176 --> 43:19.387
But it looked like someone
was there all night.

43:19.471 --> 43:22.307
l found a tampon in the toilet.

43:22.391 --> 43:25.435
l checked Megumi.
She wasn't having hers.

43:26.604 --> 43:29.314
But you started yesterday, right?

43:30.733 --> 43:34.944
- That doesn't prove anything!
- Cut the crap, murderer!

43:35.029 --> 43:39.324
Fucking all the boys
but you still had to steal mine!

43:39.408 --> 43:41.743
You made Yoshimi date all those
old pervs for cash, too, didn't you!

43:41.827 --> 43:45.788
- You probably hung them yourself!
- That's horrible...!

43:45.873 --> 43:48.541
You've always pissed me off!
l'll kill you!

43:49.335 --> 43:52.587
Come on, what is this?

43:52.671 --> 43:55.131
Stop joking, forgive me...

43:55.215 --> 43:56.758
Stop faking it!

43:56.842 --> 44:00.595
l've had it! Why does
everybody gang up on me?

44:00.679 --> 44:02.722
What did l do?

44:02.806 --> 44:08.645
Think about what you did!
Think you can get away with it?

44:08.729 --> 44:12.774
Cry, damn you! Beg for forgiveness
from Megumi and Yoshimi!

44:19.490 --> 44:21.908
This was Megumi's.

44:21.992 --> 44:24.410
But this is what l was after.

44:24.495 --> 44:27.580
You bitch! Murderer!

44:27.665 --> 44:32.001
Why not kill?
Everyone has their issues.

44:36.256 --> 44:40.677
Girl #10 Hirono - dead
23 to go

45:08.997 --> 45:11.958
Nakagawa, are you OK?

45:12.042 --> 45:15.086
l'm OK, just a little tired.

45:15.170 --> 45:19.465
You're dripping with sweat.
You've got a terrible fever.

45:20.634 --> 45:24.595
Yukiko had a crush on you, right?

45:24.680 --> 45:26.556
This is hardly the time...

45:26.640 --> 45:30.226
Sorry, l'm just a bit jealous.
That's all.

45:30.352 --> 45:34.355
There's a clinic outside the village.
Can you get up?

45:37.151 --> 45:41.320
Hey, Nakagawa!
Come on, now...

45:41.405 --> 45:42.864
Nakagawa!

46:15.439 --> 46:18.441
Pot Lid and Binoculars,
what do you two want?

46:36.794 --> 46:40.213
Nice. The drugs have expired
but they're still working.

46:42.090 --> 46:43.966
Can l ask?

46:44.051 --> 46:47.553
- What?
- Why are you helping us?

46:47.638 --> 46:51.682
My dad's a doctor,
believe it or not.

47:25.634 --> 47:31.347
Ready, lift!

47:35.936 --> 47:38.437
- What are you doing, Mimura?
- Sugimura!

47:52.536 --> 47:56.789
Great, it still works.
How did you find us?

47:56.874 --> 47:59.834
- This is my weapon.
- A tracking device?

47:59.918 --> 48:01.544
Great weapon.

48:01.628 --> 48:04.005
Have you seen Chigusa or Kotohiki?

48:04.089 --> 48:06.632
No, l haven't.

48:06.717 --> 48:10.219
- Right... then l'm off.
- Already?

48:10.304 --> 48:14.390
Sugimura, there may be a way out.

48:14.474 --> 48:16.267
Won't you help us?

48:16.351 --> 48:20.062
Sorry, but l've got to find them.

48:20.147 --> 48:23.482
lf you find Nanahara,
tell him where we are.

48:23.567 --> 48:26.652
OK. l'm off.

48:30.824 --> 48:33.409
Always was a loner.

48:33.493 --> 48:38.247
He said Chigusa and Kotohiki, right?
Why both them?

48:38.332 --> 48:40.499
l thought he was into Chigusa.

48:52.554 --> 48:55.014
Shit, so that's their trick!

48:55.098 --> 48:57.266
What is it?

49:02.022 --> 49:04.982
They're listening.

49:07.069 --> 49:10.196
A mic' in the necklace.

49:11.865 --> 49:15.368
Now to business.

49:15.452 --> 49:19.038
Find the following:

49:19.122 --> 49:21.165
1 . Fertilizer

49:21.249 --> 49:23.376
2. Pesticide

49:23.460 --> 49:26.003

49:30.342 --> 49:33.427
- Hey, what is this?
- Just go!

49:53.740 --> 49:56.659
Chigusa, how far
are you planning to run?

49:56.743 --> 50:00.579
Ahead of you, forever.

50:01.707 --> 50:04.000
l'll watch your back forever.

50:05.377 --> 50:07.294
Promise?!

50:43.832 --> 50:45.666
Hiroki.

50:46.668 --> 50:48.961
Hey, Chigusa.

50:49.046 --> 50:50.463
What are you doing?

50:50.547 --> 50:53.382
Training, at a time like this?

50:53.467 --> 50:55.468
Hey, wait.

50:55.552 --> 50:59.305
- They all gossiped about us.
- You made it all up.

50:59.389 --> 51:01.265
But you liked it.

51:01.349 --> 51:03.976
Come on, Chigusa, wait.
Stay with me.

51:04.061 --> 51:08.064
Don't touch me!
You're disgusting!

51:08.148 --> 51:10.232
Run and l'll shoot.

51:10.317 --> 51:13.194
What was that?
Pathetic!

51:14.029 --> 51:18.449
l'm in love with you,
for real, from before...

51:18.909 --> 51:24.121
Wow, great! Wash your face
and try again, if you survive.

51:24.206 --> 51:28.000
Wait! You're a virgin, right?

51:29.211 --> 51:31.087
No way.

51:31.171 --> 51:34.381
Did l just hear this idiot right?

51:34.466 --> 51:37.676
Sugimura isn't man enough to actually
sleep with a woman, after all!

51:37.969 --> 51:39.845
Keep Hiroki out of this.

51:41.264 --> 51:43.849
We're going to die anyway.

51:43.934 --> 51:49.480
Don't you want to do it once,
before you die?

51:49.564 --> 51:52.483
l think you should be
worried about your life

51:52.776 --> 51:56.195
instead of that flaccid thing
in your pants.

51:58.115 --> 52:03.494
l'm taking this game very seriously.
l'm playing it for real.

52:03.578 --> 52:05.913
So am l.

52:05.997 --> 52:09.375
Put that down right now
and let me go.

52:09.459 --> 52:15.923
Or l'll assume you want to kill me
and l'll fight back with all l've got.

52:18.385 --> 52:20.469
You've been warned.

52:20.554 --> 52:22.346
Cut the crap!

52:22.430 --> 52:26.767
l've already killed.
l could just force myself on you!

52:26.852 --> 52:28.352
Try it then!

52:29.813 --> 52:32.106
Are you OK?

52:35.652 --> 52:38.863
You've injured my face.

52:40.031 --> 52:43.868
lt's your fault.
You made me mad.

52:44.494 --> 52:49.665
Always blaming someone else!
That's why l hate your guts!

52:57.966 --> 53:00.593
Come at me.

53:00.677 --> 53:04.597
Every inch of me will resist you!

53:56.942 --> 54:01.111
Boy #16 Niida - dead
22 to go

54:18.630 --> 54:20.756
Hiroki...

54:21.716 --> 54:25.678
Chigusa... don't die.
Hang on.

54:25.762 --> 54:30.683
God, if this is a bad joke,
please stop messing with me.

54:30.767 --> 54:33.018
lt's really me, Chigusa.

54:35.313 --> 54:37.064
Hiroki...

54:37.148 --> 54:38.691
Who got you?

54:38.775 --> 54:41.360
Mitsuko.
Watch out for her.

54:42.112 --> 54:44.947
- l'm sorry.
- For what?

54:46.992 --> 54:51.745
Last night, l waited for you
outside the school.

54:53.248 --> 54:56.583
But you ran out of there
at top speed, didn't you?

54:56.668 --> 55:00.087
l called, but couldn't catch up.

55:00.964 --> 55:05.968
l didn't know...
Help me sit up.

55:16.313 --> 55:21.150
Hiroki...
Are you in love with anyone?

55:22.610 --> 55:24.486
Yeah.

55:25.488 --> 55:27.281
Not me, right?

55:29.659 --> 55:31.368
No...

55:33.288 --> 55:37.750
Then stay with me like this.

55:37.834 --> 55:39.752
lt won't be long.

55:44.341 --> 55:50.095
God, can l say one more thing?

55:54.601 --> 55:57.728
You look really cool, Hiroki...

55:59.564 --> 56:04.151
You, too.
You're the coolest girl in the world.

56:07.364 --> 56:09.114
Thank you...

56:19.793 --> 56:21.502
Chigusa...

56:35.100 --> 56:41.438
Girl #13 Chigusa - dead
21 to go

57:00.458 --> 57:04.628
lt's 6 o'clock.
Here's the list of goners.

57:04.712 --> 57:07.923
Girl #10 Hirono.

57:08.007 --> 57:11.051
Boy #16 Niida.

57:11.136 --> 57:14.930
Girl #13 Chigusa. Three in total.

57:15.014 --> 57:18.600
You're slacking.
l'm disappointed in you.

57:18.685 --> 57:21.728
l'm adding more danger zones.

57:21.813 --> 57:26.191
There'll be a new one every hour
from now on, so pay close attention!

57:26.276 --> 57:31.488
From 19:00, D-1 ,
from 20:00, C-4.

57:31.698 --> 57:34.366
l-3 from 21 :00.

57:39.247 --> 57:43.167
- This is good.
- Sure is. My dad's a chef.

57:47.714 --> 57:49.298
Hey...

57:51.468 --> 57:54.344
Thank you for everything.

57:56.222 --> 57:58.474
Have a drink?

57:58.558 --> 58:00.225
No.

58:12.155 --> 58:13.822
l wasn't going to say anything...

58:15.241 --> 58:18.994
But l guess l want you to know.

58:26.920 --> 58:28.837
She's pretty...

58:28.922 --> 58:32.382
- Are you the same age?
- Same class.

58:32.884 --> 58:36.386
9th Grade Class C,
Kobe Junior High.

58:36.471 --> 58:39.640
We were in this game
three years ago.

58:39.724 --> 58:43.101
- So you're...?
- A survivor...

58:44.437 --> 58:46.438
...of this fucking game.

58:48.233 --> 58:51.902
l was desperate to protect Keiko.

58:53.363 --> 58:55.864
l turned a gun on my best friend

58:55.949 --> 58:58.784
so the two of us could survive.

59:16.427 --> 59:19.763
But as the time limit approached

59:19.847 --> 59:21.473
something changed.

59:42.870 --> 59:44.871
Keiko! Keiko!

59:53.089 --> 59:57.426
Really trusting someone...
is a hard thing to do.

59:59.596 --> 01:00:01.722
But l've never understood...

01:00:03.891 --> 01:00:07.769
...the meaning in the smile
she left behind.

01:00:19.115 --> 01:00:21.116
Thank you...

01:00:46.434 --> 01:00:48.935
l'll have that drink.

01:00:58.905 --> 01:01:01.990
But why play all over again?

01:01:03.076 --> 01:01:06.286
They kept me back in school
and then dragged me here...

01:01:07.664 --> 01:01:10.082
...to shake things up during the game.

01:01:10.166 --> 01:01:14.378
But when l woke up here, l vowed

01:01:15.004 --> 01:01:18.048
that l wasn't going to die
on this island.

01:01:18.132 --> 01:01:21.927
lnstead, l'm going to figure out
what Keiko's last smile meant.

01:01:25.556 --> 01:01:27.432
l don't...

01:01:28.142 --> 01:01:30.018
What?

01:01:31.646 --> 01:01:36.441
l don't know exactly
how Keiko felt.

01:01:38.152 --> 01:01:40.737
But she must have...

01:01:42.699 --> 01:01:46.993
- Er...
- My name? Kawada.

01:01:47.078 --> 01:01:49.830
l think she really loved you, Kawada.

01:01:50.832 --> 01:01:55.460
Or she couldn't have smiled
as she did in that photo.

01:01:57.130 --> 01:01:59.214
You think...?

01:02:00.049 --> 01:02:03.885
l'm sure if l were Keiko,

01:02:03.970 --> 01:02:09.933
l'd want to trust and thank you for
giving me a reason to smile like that.

01:02:10.017 --> 01:02:13.729
l think l'd have said
thank you, too...

01:02:20.111 --> 01:02:24.823
- l do know a way off this island.
- What? But how?

01:02:24.907 --> 01:02:28.243
l can only tell you
when the time comes.

01:02:29.579 --> 01:02:31.955
Until then, take this as my word.

01:02:32.874 --> 01:02:36.001
Use it to protect yourself and...

01:02:37.128 --> 01:02:38.920
Noriko Nakagawa.

01:02:39.005 --> 01:02:40.547
Shuya Nanahara.

01:02:42.925 --> 01:02:45.010
The candles!

01:02:49.515 --> 01:02:51.266
Get down!

01:02:51.392 --> 01:02:53.560
lt's that same noise.
Who is that?

01:02:53.644 --> 01:02:57.189
Probably the one guy
who signed up willingly for this shit.

01:02:57.273 --> 01:02:59.191
We had one of those, too.

01:03:18.419 --> 01:03:20.295
Give me your map.

01:03:20.421 --> 01:03:24.216
lfwe get separated,
let's meet at the Takano Shrine.

01:03:24.300 --> 01:03:27.636
Don't forget! Stay down!

01:03:35.853 --> 01:03:38.146
Why? What did l ever do to you?

01:04:14.058 --> 01:04:19.479
Yes, l made it!
What a sweet bulletproof vest!

01:04:34.161 --> 01:04:38.498
Boy #4 Oda - dead
20 to go

01:05:26.047 --> 01:05:27.631
Hurry!

01:05:42.271 --> 01:05:45.190
- You OK?
- Fine. She's all right, too.

01:05:48.444 --> 01:05:50.570
Take care of her!

01:05:52.740 --> 01:05:54.908
Don't be crazy!

01:05:56.285 --> 01:05:58.161
Nanahara!

01:06:44.750 --> 01:06:46.918
Run, Nanahara!

01:07:02.601 --> 01:07:04.436
There's your order.

01:07:04.520 --> 01:07:08.023
Fertilizer... pesticide...
and kerosene.

01:07:08.107 --> 01:07:10.233
Sulphur and charcoal...

01:07:10.317 --> 01:07:12.902
l even found a truck to carry it all in.

01:07:12.987 --> 01:07:17.157
What are you going to do
with all this crap?

01:07:21.871 --> 01:07:26.458
"The Ticking Clock?"
What is this?

01:07:32.673 --> 01:07:34.674
My uncle's postcards.

01:07:34.759 --> 01:07:37.552
My uncle is an old-time fighter.

01:07:37.678 --> 01:07:40.847
He taught me stuff
they never teach you in school.

01:07:40.931 --> 01:07:44.809
He's still off fighting
in some corner of the world.

01:07:46.562 --> 01:07:49.564
"l hope you smile like this, too."

01:07:49.940 --> 01:07:52.108
You're kidding, this is why...

01:07:53.235 --> 01:07:55.236
Shinji!

01:08:05.664 --> 01:08:08.041
This is the trigger from a bomb.

01:08:08.125 --> 01:08:09.959
He was going to use it
to blow up Parliament.

01:08:10.044 --> 01:08:14.839
lt's time we started our own struggle,
but there's not much time.

01:08:14.924 --> 01:08:17.175
Are you in?

01:08:19.178 --> 01:08:22.846
Or would you rather
we just kill each other?

01:08:26.435 --> 01:08:30.104
Can we really
all go home together?

01:08:30.189 --> 01:08:33.274
Yeah. We'll destroy this stupid system.

01:08:34.318 --> 01:08:36.903
Then we'll all escape together.

01:08:41.951 --> 01:08:46.537
Day Two 12:30pm

01:09:00.426 --> 01:09:03.263
- Are you awake?
- Where am l?

01:09:03.346 --> 01:09:06.975
- The lighthouse.
- Utsumi, why are you...?

01:09:07.059 --> 01:09:10.645
You really gave me a surprise.

01:09:10.770 --> 01:09:14.314
This morning, when l was on lookout,
Sugimura carried you in, soaked.

01:09:26.078 --> 01:09:31.124
- Where's Sugimura?
- He said he had to see someone.

01:09:31.207 --> 01:09:34.752
l see...
What time is it?

01:09:34.837 --> 01:09:38.881
Noon.
He just finished the noon report.

01:09:38.966 --> 01:09:41.134
And Kawada and Nakagawa?

01:09:41.218 --> 01:09:43.845
They weren't on the lists.

01:09:45.139 --> 01:09:50.225
Who died?
l've missed three reports.

01:09:50.310 --> 01:09:54.689
Five altogether.
Oda was on last night's list.

01:09:58.360 --> 01:10:02.614
On this morning's update,
Kaori and Mizuho.

01:10:05.201 --> 01:10:07.327
We'll always be friends.

01:10:07.411 --> 01:10:09.829
l know.

01:10:12.708 --> 01:10:18.713
Girls #1 Mizuho, #12 Kaori - dead

01:10:21.091 --> 01:10:23.384
And on the noon update,

01:10:23.469 --> 01:10:25.720
Takiguchi and Hatagami.

01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:38.441
Boys #13 Takiguchi,
#18 Hatagami - dead

01:10:38.525 --> 01:10:40.401
16 to go

01:10:41.070 --> 01:10:43.154
And a message from Sugimura.

01:10:43.239 --> 01:10:45.323
Mimura and the guys are in the west.

01:10:45.407 --> 01:10:47.367
They're waiting to see you.

01:10:47.451 --> 01:10:49.661
- Mimura...?
- Yeah.

01:10:49.745 --> 01:10:53.122
Here's your map.
l marked it for you.

01:10:54.083 --> 01:10:57.543
You're safe here.
Everyone here is my friend.

01:10:58.629 --> 01:11:03.007
There's Haruka, Satomi,
Yuka, Chisato and Yuko.

01:11:06.929 --> 01:11:09.097
Nanahara...

01:11:09.181 --> 01:11:14.769
About that thing with Oki...
Yuko saw it happen.

01:11:15.354 --> 01:11:18.773
Yeah, we fell down a hill together.

01:11:18.899 --> 01:11:20.984
- An accident?
- Of course it was!

01:11:21.068 --> 01:11:24.529
- l'm sorry...
- Let's all go and join Kawada.

01:11:24.613 --> 01:11:27.949
- He knows a way out.
- Can we trust him?

01:11:28.033 --> 01:11:30.785
He's survived
one of these games before.

01:11:30.869 --> 01:11:33.329
But you can't even walk yet.

01:11:33.414 --> 01:11:36.082
- l'm fine...
- Right now, just rest.

01:11:36.166 --> 01:11:40.295
Haruka and Chisato
are fixing lunch.

01:11:41.797 --> 01:11:44.215
You did this for me?

01:11:45.217 --> 01:11:46.718
Yeah.

01:11:48.345 --> 01:11:51.389
lt was my first time
touching a man's body.

01:11:57.021 --> 01:11:58.938
Do you like Noriko?

01:12:00.232 --> 01:12:04.402
- Why...?
- l know all about you...

01:12:05.487 --> 01:12:08.740
Do you know what that means?

01:12:08.824 --> 01:12:10.742
What?

01:12:10.826 --> 01:12:14.370
Forget it...
l have to lock you in, OK?

01:12:14.455 --> 01:12:17.206
Some of them
didn't want to let a guy inside.

01:12:17.291 --> 01:12:19.375
Lunch in a minute!

01:12:48.280 --> 01:12:51.074
Hey, guys!
Nanahara's awake.

01:12:51.158 --> 01:12:52.784
Really? Can he talk?

01:12:52.868 --> 01:12:54.994
Yeah. He seems hungry, too.

01:12:56.163 --> 01:12:59.332
Don't worry, Yuko. l locked his door.

01:12:59.416 --> 01:13:02.668
No, l'm sorry.
l'm not worried any more.

01:13:02.753 --> 01:13:06.255
What happened with Oki
was an accident.

01:13:06.340 --> 01:13:09.634
Of course.
Shuya would never kill anyone.

01:13:09.718 --> 01:13:11.803
The spaghetti is almost done.

01:13:11.887 --> 01:13:14.806
Haruka, bring Yuka in from watch.

01:13:14.890 --> 01:13:16.432
We need to discuss something.

01:13:16.517 --> 01:13:18.434
Roger that.

01:13:23.565 --> 01:13:25.274
We're all...

01:13:26.735 --> 01:13:29.278
...going to die tomorrow, aren't we?

01:13:29.988 --> 01:13:31.572
Don't start with that.

01:13:31.657 --> 01:13:35.701
We can't just give up.

01:13:35.786 --> 01:13:41.332
l think... we'd better feed
Nanahara first, don't you?

01:13:41.417 --> 01:13:43.501
- Right.
- l'll serve him.

01:13:43.585 --> 01:13:44.919
Thanks, Yuko.

01:13:55.222 --> 01:13:56.681
Hey!

01:13:56.765 --> 01:14:01.352
There are still some painkillers.
l'll get some for Nanahara.

01:14:01.437 --> 01:14:03.855
- ln the cupboard.
- l'll get them.

01:14:03.939 --> 01:14:05.815
Yukie!

01:14:05.899 --> 01:14:10.486
l hear Nanahara's awake!
That's so great! You lucky thing!

01:14:10.571 --> 01:14:15.950
Don't pretend, l know you're happy.
Smells great... Great job, Chisato.

01:14:16.034 --> 01:14:17.952
Let me have a taste.

01:14:18.078 --> 01:14:20.288
Super!
Marry me, Chisato!

01:14:20.372 --> 01:14:23.249
- Cut it out, Yuka!
- Let's have some quiet.

01:14:23.333 --> 01:14:26.544
What did you want
to discuss, Yukie?

01:14:27.629 --> 01:14:32.258
Nanahara says Kawada
knows a way off the island.

01:14:32.342 --> 01:14:34.635
- The transfer kid?
- Can we trust him?

01:14:34.761 --> 01:14:41.142
l hope so. Once Nanahara can walk,
let's join Kawada and Noriko...

01:14:42.186 --> 01:14:44.395
What's wrong?

01:14:45.230 --> 01:14:47.356
What's wrong!

01:14:48.692 --> 01:14:50.193
Yuka!

01:14:52.154 --> 01:14:54.113
- She's dead...
- Why...?

01:14:54.198 --> 01:14:56.324
Could it be food poisoning?

01:14:56.408 --> 01:14:59.744
- That kills instantly?
- l tasted it, l'm fine.

01:14:59.828 --> 01:15:01.871
lt must be... poison!

01:15:01.955 --> 01:15:03.873
Poison!

01:15:06.668 --> 01:15:08.336
Who did it?

01:15:08.420 --> 01:15:11.589
- Satomi, don't!
- This is all just a mistake!

01:15:11.673 --> 01:15:15.593
We're the only ones here!
Chisato, you cooked it, right?

01:15:15.677 --> 01:15:19.096
- No! Haruka cooked too!
- Me? No way!

01:15:19.181 --> 01:15:24.310
Nobody did it. Just cut it out!
Put that gun down!

01:15:24.394 --> 01:15:27.021
- You're acting the most suspicious!
- Haruka!

01:15:27.105 --> 01:15:30.233
You didn't sleep last night,
or the night before, did you?

01:15:30.317 --> 01:15:34.529
- You don't trust us, do you?
- l forgot my sleeping pills!

01:15:34.613 --> 01:15:39.408
- That's even more suspicious!
- Come on! Satomi, put the gun down!

01:15:39.493 --> 01:15:41.494
Shut up, damn it!

01:15:44.581 --> 01:15:47.792
- Yukie, quit playing leader!
- Chisato...

01:15:47.876 --> 01:15:52.046
- You're covering your own tracks!
- How can you say that?

01:15:52.130 --> 01:15:55.841
You've been scheming with Nanahara
to escape together!

01:15:55.926 --> 01:15:57.635
lt was you!

01:16:00.639 --> 01:16:02.557
Chisato!

01:16:16.947 --> 01:16:21.909
Ouch! That hurts! You assholes!
l'm bleeding, damn it!

01:16:23.495 --> 01:16:25.538
Different story now, isn't it?

01:16:25.622 --> 01:16:28.082
- Murderer!
- Shut the fuck up!

01:16:28.208 --> 01:16:32.753
She tried to steal the gun!
That makes her guilty!

01:16:32.838 --> 01:16:34.338
Take that!

01:16:51.356 --> 01:16:56.485
Not you, right...?
You're not one of the killers...?

01:16:59.698 --> 01:17:04.493
At least... l thought
l'd live until tomorrow.

01:17:12.336 --> 01:17:16.422
ldiots...
We might have all survived...

01:17:17.382 --> 01:17:20.051
We're all so stupid...

01:17:21.136 --> 01:17:22.637
Stupid!

01:17:31.980 --> 01:17:36.901
lt's not my fault...
lt's not my fault...

01:17:37.694 --> 01:17:40.112
lt's not my fault!

01:17:40.947 --> 01:17:43.949
What happened! Utsumi?

01:17:44.034 --> 01:17:47.370
What happened? Hey, Utsumi!

01:18:00.175 --> 01:18:02.426
l'm sorry, Nanahara.

01:18:03.720 --> 01:18:08.808
l forgot how much
l liked all of them!

01:18:32.916 --> 01:18:35.084
Why?

01:18:35.168 --> 01:18:36.877
Utsumi...

01:18:38.547 --> 01:18:40.506
Why...?

01:18:40.799 --> 01:18:43.843
Do you know what that means?

01:19:02.070 --> 01:19:04.989
How should l know?

01:19:07.534 --> 01:19:12.913
l don't know what any of it means!

01:19:20.464 --> 01:19:23.549
Girls #2 Yukie, #9 Yuko, #12 Haruka,
#1 7 Satomi, #19 Chisato - dead

01:19:23.633 --> 01:19:25.259
10 to go

01:21:08.321 --> 01:21:10.197
There's a call for you.

01:21:16.538 --> 01:21:20.124
- Hello.
- Hello, mister.

01:21:20.208 --> 01:21:22.001
Oh, Shiori?

01:21:22.085 --> 01:21:24.587
Where are you?
Mum's feeling bad again.

01:21:25.755 --> 01:21:29.550
l'm on a business trip.
l can't get home till tomorrow.

01:21:31.595 --> 01:21:34.138
Don't hurry back on my account.

01:21:36.391 --> 01:21:38.601
I'm hanging up.

01:21:40.687 --> 01:21:43.022
And can you not breathe
on the phone?

01:21:43.106 --> 01:21:46.358
I can smell your stinking breath.

01:22:00.790 --> 01:22:02.541
Are you OK?

01:22:03.501 --> 01:22:05.336
l had a dream...

01:22:05.420 --> 01:22:07.922
What dream?

01:22:08.006 --> 01:22:12.301
l was alone with Kitano
on an empty riverbank.

01:22:12.385 --> 01:22:14.720
Must have been scary.

01:22:14.804 --> 01:22:17.348
But Kitano...

01:22:17.432 --> 01:22:19.600
...just seemed lonely.

01:22:29.945 --> 01:22:35.115
Before this, l always just
thought of myself as normal.

01:22:37.369 --> 01:22:43.290
l'd get married, grow old,
just like my own mum...

01:22:47.087 --> 01:22:51.966
But taking part in this game,
l've come to see...

01:22:52.050 --> 01:22:55.344
l just didn't have a clue.

01:22:55.428 --> 01:22:57.888
There are some things
you're better off not knowing.

01:23:00.016 --> 01:23:02.226
lt's going to rain.

01:23:03.687 --> 01:23:07.272
l hope Nanahara can find us here.

01:23:21.413 --> 01:23:23.455
I told you to wait!

01:23:28.128 --> 01:23:31.505
Another day wasted.
The phone never rings.

01:23:31.589 --> 01:23:35.384
Even my mobile is useless.
See, it's out of range.

01:23:35.468 --> 01:23:38.262
- May l take your order?
- Just a minute.

01:23:38.346 --> 01:23:40.723
As you wish.

01:23:40.807 --> 01:23:45.352
All those CVs written for nothing.
l'm just wiped out.

01:23:45.437 --> 01:23:47.771
l'm sick of them hanging up on me, too.

01:23:49.065 --> 01:23:53.110
- Miss, some water please.
- Of course. One minute.

01:23:54.279 --> 01:23:59.199
Anyway, order whatever you want.
You start 7th grade tomorrow.

01:24:00.660 --> 01:24:04.538
l'd say, "Go for it",
but l never taught you anything.

01:24:04.664 --> 01:24:07.458
- Your order?
- l said just a minute!

01:24:09.753 --> 01:24:11.545
Shall we try somewhere else?

01:24:26.352 --> 01:24:30.314
"Go Shuya!
You can do it, Shuya!"

01:24:46.372 --> 01:24:48.415
Shuya...

01:24:48.500 --> 01:24:53.587
Look after Nakagawa, OK?
Promise you'll protect her.

01:25:13.608 --> 01:25:15.526
- Where are you going?
- To meet Nanahara.

01:25:15.610 --> 01:25:18.529
Hey! We're near a danger zone!

01:25:30.458 --> 01:25:34.169
Where are you? Nakagawa!

01:25:46.808 --> 01:25:48.725
Mitsuko.

01:25:49.644 --> 01:25:51.270
What's up?

01:25:51.354 --> 01:25:55.941
- l'm looking for Nanahara.
- You got separated?

01:25:56.025 --> 01:25:59.111
Nakagawa, where are you?

01:25:59.195 --> 01:26:01.905
- Who's that?
- Kawada.

01:26:05.034 --> 01:26:09.079
Two princes protecting you.
A real princess!

01:26:10.206 --> 01:26:13.667
- Mitsuko!
- Die, ugly.

01:26:20.967 --> 01:26:22.676
Hey.

01:26:24.762 --> 01:26:26.638
You don't look so bad.

01:26:28.683 --> 01:26:31.685
Oh, you've got Nanahara with you.

01:26:33.062 --> 01:26:35.022
Nanahara!

01:26:50.246 --> 01:26:55.292
Shuya!

01:27:01.758 --> 01:27:04.134
Don't catch cold.

01:27:13.311 --> 01:27:15.479
You came to meet me?

01:27:22.278 --> 01:27:24.363
l brought weapons.

01:27:27.033 --> 01:27:30.160
Weapons... why?

01:27:32.205 --> 01:27:34.498
l'm weak

01:27:36.376 --> 01:27:38.502
and useless

01:27:40.129 --> 01:27:42.381
but l'll stay by your side...

01:27:45.635 --> 01:27:48.262
l'll protect you.

01:27:49.180 --> 01:27:51.348
That's why

01:27:51.432 --> 01:27:54.768
l brought weapons...

01:27:57.063 --> 01:27:58.897
Shuya...

01:29:25.026 --> 01:29:28.320
Kotohiki, is that you?

01:29:31.783 --> 01:29:34.284
Kotohiki.
Answer me!

01:29:48.549 --> 01:29:51.635
- Quick, run away!
- What?

01:29:51.719 --> 01:29:57.391
Someone will come,
because of the gunshots... run!

01:29:58.017 --> 01:29:59.935
Why?

01:30:00.061 --> 01:30:03.480
Sugimura, why?

01:30:04.315 --> 01:30:07.651
You're so cute.

01:30:09.320 --> 01:30:13.323
What are you talking about?
What is this?

01:30:14.867 --> 01:30:16.785
l wanted to see you.

01:30:17.870 --> 01:30:21.832
To save you, actually...

01:30:24.794 --> 01:30:29.840
- Don't tell me.
- l've been in love with you, Kotohiki...

01:30:29.924 --> 01:30:34.594
...for a long, long... time...

01:31:12.216 --> 01:31:15.844
But you never even talked to me.

01:31:17.305 --> 01:31:22.225
How could l have known?
You never said a thing!

01:31:23.519 --> 01:31:26.605
What am l supposed to do now?

01:31:28.107 --> 01:31:29.983
Die.

01:31:35.239 --> 01:31:37.407
Boy #1 1 Sugimura,
Girl #8 Kotohiki - dead

01:31:37.492 --> 01:31:39.159
8 to go

01:31:41.621 --> 01:31:43.497
Bye, Mitsuko!

01:31:43.581 --> 01:31:45.540
- See you tomorrow!
- Bye-bye!

01:31:47.168 --> 01:31:48.919
l'm home!

01:31:50.213 --> 01:31:54.758
- Who are you?
- Who am l? Well, l'm...

01:31:57.678 --> 01:31:59.638
What happened to Mummy?

01:32:00.723 --> 01:32:03.266
Mummy's tummy hurts.

01:32:03.351 --> 01:32:06.811
How about we play together,
instead.

01:32:06.896 --> 01:32:08.813
No!

01:32:09.649 --> 01:32:13.026
Be strong, Mitsuko.

01:32:14.403 --> 01:32:19.449
lf you're not strong,
you'll end up just like me.

01:32:20.576 --> 01:32:23.036
Hello there, Mitsuko.

01:32:23.162 --> 01:32:27.207
This little girl's name
is Mitsuko, too.

01:32:27.291 --> 01:32:29.417
lsn't she cute?

01:32:29.502 --> 01:32:32.170
She's cute and really fun.

01:32:32.255 --> 01:32:34.172
See?

01:32:38.844 --> 01:32:41.304
All her clothes are off.

01:32:41.389 --> 01:32:44.349
Now it's our other Mitsuko's turn.

01:32:44.433 --> 01:32:46.601
Let's take them all off.

01:32:46.686 --> 01:32:48.603
No!

01:33:09.041 --> 01:33:11.543
No one is going to save you.

01:33:11.627 --> 01:33:13.795
That's just life.

01:33:40.990 --> 01:33:42.907
Die!

01:34:11.103 --> 01:34:16.316
l just didn't want to be a loser any more.

01:34:26.952 --> 01:34:31.373
Girl #1 1 Mitsuko - dead
7 to go

01:34:41.217 --> 01:34:44.094
Girls #16 Yuka,

01:34:44.178 --> 01:34:46.638
#19 Chisato,

01:34:46.722 --> 01:34:49.391
#12 Haruka,

01:34:49.475 --> 01:34:53.603
#1 7 Satomi, #2 Yukie,

01:34:53.688 --> 01:34:57.732
#9 Yuko, #8 Kotohiki,

01:34:57.817 --> 01:35:00.151
#11 Mitsuko,

01:35:00.236 --> 01:35:04.531
and only one of the boys,
#11 Sugimura,

01:35:04.615 --> 01:35:06.533
making nine in total.

01:35:08.327 --> 01:35:12.706
Let's head west. We can still avoid
the new danger zones.

01:35:13.624 --> 01:35:17.210
l've got to see Mimura.

01:35:17.962 --> 01:35:20.088
All right...

01:36:46.300 --> 01:36:48.760
Got it! l got it!

01:36:48.844 --> 01:36:50.762
- We're done too!
- Excellent!

01:36:50.846 --> 01:36:54.140
- Two bombs, 100 Molotovs.
- And three propane tanks.

01:36:54.225 --> 01:36:58.853
lt took time to rewrite, but my Third
Man hacker programme is ready to go!

01:37:01.232 --> 01:37:03.608
- Hackers!
- From where?

01:37:03.692 --> 01:37:05.652
- Can't tell!
- Can't you trace it?

01:37:05.736 --> 01:37:08.655
- There are too many connections!
- They're into the root index!

01:37:08.739 --> 01:37:12.534
- Files are being replaced!
- GPS monitoring is frozen!

01:37:19.708 --> 01:37:23.878
- Virus invasion!
- lt's rewriting everything!

01:37:23.963 --> 01:37:26.589
- lt's too fast!
- Satellite system frozen!

01:37:26.674 --> 01:37:28.925
- Collar control monitor, lost!
- All connections down!

01:37:29.009 --> 01:37:32.971
- Danger zones have been cleared!
- Do something!

01:37:35.349 --> 01:37:37.517
- Goddamn it!
- Sir!

01:37:37.601 --> 01:37:40.311
What are you...?

01:37:42.064 --> 01:37:45.483
- Sir!
- Restart it.

01:37:45.568 --> 01:37:47.861
OK, here goes!

01:37:58.372 --> 01:38:04.294
We've got to ram this into the school
in the 15 minutes before they recover.

01:38:05.963 --> 01:38:08.047
l just saw someone over there.

01:38:08.132 --> 01:38:10.174
- What?
- Nanahara?

01:38:10.259 --> 01:38:14.178
- Nanahara?
- l bet Sugimura told him about us.

01:38:14.263 --> 01:38:18.600
Hey, Nanahara, come on out! Hurry!

01:38:27.151 --> 01:38:29.068
Shit, who is that?

01:38:30.613 --> 01:38:32.405
The transfer student!

01:38:36.952 --> 01:38:40.038
- l can't hit him.
- Stay calm!

01:38:41.248 --> 01:38:43.333
- You missed again!
- Shut up!

01:38:47.338 --> 01:38:49.464
No good, back inside!

01:38:53.636 --> 01:38:55.762
lijima! lijima!

01:38:57.306 --> 01:39:00.767
When we escape,
it'll all be together...

01:39:00.851 --> 01:39:04.187
Shit! Goddamn it!

01:39:19.495 --> 01:39:21.913
Boys #2 lijima, #12 Yutaka,
#19 Mimura - dead

01:39:21.997 --> 01:39:23.873
4 to go

01:39:53.112 --> 01:39:55.446
lt's him.

01:40:08.377 --> 01:40:10.253
Stay here.

01:40:47.958 --> 01:40:52.336
Boy #6 Kiriyama - dead
3 to go

01:41:01.597 --> 01:41:03.765
Are you hurt?

01:41:03.849 --> 01:41:05.767
lt's no big deal.

01:41:06.894 --> 01:41:11.898
All that matters now
is that we're the only ones left.

01:41:11.982 --> 01:41:13.566
Yeah.

01:41:13.692 --> 01:41:16.778
What will you do after this?

01:41:17.112 --> 01:41:19.072
l don't know.

01:41:20.115 --> 01:41:23.743
l've never really trusted adults.

01:41:25.871 --> 01:41:30.583
My dad and my mum...

01:41:31.794 --> 01:41:36.130
...ran off or died,
just because they felt like it.

01:41:40.135 --> 01:41:45.014
But l'll keep fighting,
even though l don't know how...

01:41:47.309 --> 01:41:50.228
Until l become a real adult.

01:41:51.730 --> 01:41:53.981
You won't make it.

01:41:54.566 --> 01:41:56.651
Why not?

01:41:56.777 --> 01:42:01.155
l told you, didn't l?
Don't trust anyone.

01:42:01.865 --> 01:42:07.495
- Yeah.
- Well, you both trusted me too much.

01:42:07.579 --> 01:42:10.665
- You lose.
- Cut the sickjoke.

01:42:10.791 --> 01:42:13.584
This was my way off the island.

01:42:13.669 --> 01:42:17.213
Sorry, but l used you guys
to save myself.

01:42:18.090 --> 01:42:21.843
l don't believe it.
What about Keiko?

01:42:21.927 --> 01:42:26.055
There's no Keiko.
She was just a story to suck you in.

01:42:26.140 --> 01:42:27.849
But why us?

01:42:27.933 --> 01:42:33.020
You were perfect.
Just gullible enough.

01:42:35.774 --> 01:42:40.820
Hey, Nanahara.
Can you really kill me with that gun?

01:42:45.284 --> 01:42:47.952
Game over.
For real, this time.

01:42:52.624 --> 01:42:55.543
- Move out and confirm their bodies.
- Roger!

01:42:55.627 --> 01:42:57.587
Operation complete.

01:42:57.671 --> 01:43:00.673
- But sir...
- Operation complete.

01:43:12.186 --> 01:43:14.604
Game Over
Day Three 4:30am

01:43:14.688 --> 01:43:17.440
The Winner: Boy #5 Kawada

01:43:50.432 --> 01:43:52.558
BR Radio Exercises

01:43:56.980 --> 01:44:01.525
Raise your arms in front of you
and stand on your toes.

01:44:01.610 --> 01:44:06.364
1 , 2, 3, 4...

01:44:07.950 --> 01:44:10.243
Move your arms and legs.

01:44:22.089 --> 01:44:23.965
Rotate your arms.

01:44:36.436 --> 01:44:41.565
Stand with legs apart
and push out your chest.

01:44:59.626 --> 01:45:04.839
Nice job.
Glad you and Kiriyama were in the mix.

01:45:04.965 --> 01:45:07.550
- Not going home?
- There's no rush.

01:45:07.801 --> 01:45:10.177
l want to check one thing first.

01:45:20.147 --> 01:45:24.859
- You know how to stop the necklaces.
- l don't know what you mean.

01:45:24.985 --> 01:45:30.114
Someone hacked in and stole that data.
lt was you, not Mimura, wasn't it?

01:45:31.616 --> 01:45:33.617
Why? To avenge Keiko?

01:45:34.828 --> 01:45:38.581
That's fine.
That's why you played the game, right?

01:45:39.791 --> 01:45:42.835
But cheating is no good.

01:45:49.343 --> 01:45:52.595
Hey! How was it? Fun?

01:45:53.472 --> 01:45:56.557
Two lovebirds, surviving together.

01:45:57.559 --> 01:46:00.019
l've had it.

01:46:00.103 --> 01:46:04.982
The kids make fun of me at school
and my own kid hates me.

01:46:05.067 --> 01:46:07.568
There's nowhere l want to go back to.

01:46:08.195 --> 01:46:12.656
So we're all going down together.

01:46:41.895 --> 01:46:46.899
The only one worth dying with,
would be you, Nakagawa.

01:46:50.404 --> 01:46:56.117
lf l had to choose one of you,
it would have to be you, Nakagawa.

01:47:01.581 --> 01:47:04.708
What? Go ahead, shoot.

01:47:08.296 --> 01:47:16.512
Nakagawa, you can do it.

01:47:24.938 --> 01:47:28.232
"Go Shuya!
You can do it, Shuya!"

01:47:32.487 --> 01:47:36.365
What's up?
Shoot me or l'll shoot you.

01:47:40.328 --> 01:47:42.621
Ouch!

01:47:42.706 --> 01:47:44.999
That hurt, damn it!

01:47:54.634 --> 01:48:00.389
l made a promise
to protect Noriko...

01:48:02.142 --> 01:48:03.976
l know...

01:48:04.644 --> 01:48:06.687
l know.

01:48:36.468 --> 01:48:38.761
Hello...

01:48:38.845 --> 01:48:40.888
Shiori?

01:48:40.972 --> 01:48:46.227
Listen, l'm not coming home.

01:48:48.021 --> 01:48:53.567
lf you hate someone then you
have to live with the consequences.

01:48:54.903 --> 01:48:57.780
lrresponsible?
Who the hell asked you?!

01:49:11.586 --> 01:49:13.379
The last one...

01:49:16.383 --> 01:49:18.259
Damn good cookies.

01:49:55.714 --> 01:50:00.634
lt's beautiful... even though
it's where everyone died.

01:50:04.014 --> 01:50:06.015
You can even steer a ship?

01:50:06.099 --> 01:50:09.435
Sure, my dad's a fisherman.

01:50:12.480 --> 01:50:16.942
Just keep going straight
and you have to hit land.

01:50:17.027 --> 01:50:18.652
Give it a try?

01:50:23.283 --> 01:50:28.495
We part soon.
l doubt we'll see each other again.

01:50:28.997 --> 01:50:33.083
- Why not?
- lt's for the best.

01:50:33.168 --> 01:50:37.921
lt was only three days, but a lot
of memories l'd rather forget.

01:50:45.472 --> 01:50:47.640
- Kawada...
- Yeah?

01:50:49.726 --> 01:50:51.769
Thank you so much.

01:50:53.104 --> 01:50:56.774
- Nanahara!
- Yeah?

01:50:56.858 --> 01:50:59.652
lt's going to be tough going.

01:51:00.654 --> 01:51:04.365
Yeah... l know.

01:51:07.827 --> 01:51:12.164
l feel sleepy, all of a sudden.
Time for a nap.

01:51:14.042 --> 01:51:16.293
Meeting you guys,

01:51:16.378 --> 01:51:21.507
l finally solved
the riddle of Keiko's smile.

01:51:21.591 --> 01:51:23.759
What's the answer?

01:51:23.843 --> 01:51:26.303
Her parting words.

01:51:28.056 --> 01:51:31.684
"Thank you... at the end..."

01:51:34.688 --> 01:51:36.563
At the end...?

01:51:40.902 --> 01:51:44.571
Kawada?

01:51:48.910 --> 01:51:54.081
At the end,
I'm glad I found a true friend.

01:51:59.963 --> 01:52:02.673
At the end,

01:52:02.757 --> 01:52:08.262
l'm glad l found a true friend.

01:52:17.647 --> 01:52:21.024
Wanted on suspicion of murder

01:52:21.109 --> 01:52:25.571
and aiding and abetting a murderer.

01:52:51.556 --> 01:52:55.684
Noriko slipped home last night

01:52:55.769 --> 01:52:58.687
to bid her sleeping parents farewell.

01:52:58.772 --> 01:53:05.486
She took the knife that Nobu
used to stab Kitano from her desk.

01:53:07.572 --> 01:53:11.575
Each of us has a weapon now.

01:53:13.077 --> 01:53:16.288
Even if the time comes
to use them again,

01:53:17.207 --> 01:53:21.043
it'll never be an easy choice.

01:53:23.463 --> 01:53:28.592
But we have no choice
but to keep moving forward.

01:53:38.228 --> 01:53:39.853
Let's run, Noriko.

01:53:39.938 --> 01:53:41.647
Yes.

01:53:43.274 --> 01:53:47.319
No matter how far,
run for all you're worth.

01:53:49.113 --> 01:53:53.033
RUN!

01:53:56.162 --> 01:54:02.084
Requiem l
9th Grade Class B - Friends

01:54:54.345 --> 01:55:00.058
Requiem ll
Shuya's Dream

01:55:18.536 --> 01:55:20.037
Nobu...

01:55:20.955 --> 01:55:23.123
Shuya...

01:55:23.207 --> 01:55:28.420
Look after Nakagawa, OK?
Promise you'll protect her.

01:55:34.218 --> 01:55:40.933
Requiem lll
Noriko's and Kitano's Dream

01:55:54.572 --> 01:55:57.199
- Are you OK with this?
- What?

01:55:57.283 --> 01:56:02.120
lf anyone sees us together
you'll get locked in the toilet again.

01:56:02.205 --> 01:56:05.415
No, l've had my turn for now.

01:56:05.875 --> 01:56:08.502
- Are my classes boring?
- Yes.

01:56:08.628 --> 01:56:10.462
How dare you!

01:56:11.965 --> 01:56:13.840
Coming into the classroom...

01:56:14.634 --> 01:56:18.011
All the kids look the same.
Like lumpy, ugly potatoes.

01:56:18.096 --> 01:56:22.808
Slapping them around helped me
tell them apart, to grow to like them.

01:56:22.934 --> 01:56:25.143
But not any more.

01:56:25.228 --> 01:56:28.522
Lay your hands on a student now
and you're fired.

01:56:28.648 --> 01:56:32.734
Now, you can't even get angry
when a student stabs you!

01:56:33.736 --> 01:56:36.905
- Can l tell you something?
- What?

01:56:36.990 --> 01:56:39.533
The knife that stabbed you...

01:56:39.659 --> 01:56:44.246
To tell you the truth,
l keep it in my desk at home.

01:56:45.707 --> 01:56:49.084
When l picked it up
l wasn't sure what do with it.

01:56:49.168 --> 01:56:52.879
But now, for some reason,
l really treasure it.

01:56:57.427 --> 01:57:00.262
That's our secret.
Just between us.

01:57:02.724 --> 01:57:05.559
- Tell me, Nakagawa.
- Yes?

01:57:05.685 --> 01:57:16.028
ln this moment,
what should an adult say to a kid?
