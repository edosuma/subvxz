WEBVTT

00:01.135 --> 00:03.171
I'm Xavier, with an "X."
Your life is so much fun.

00:03.204 --> 00:06.740
Gonna live life while I can.
What does that mean?

00:06.774 --> 00:10.378
Humankind only has eight months
and 12 days left on Earth.

00:10.411 --> 00:11.212
You're serious.

00:11.245 --> 00:13.547
Yeah, the apocalypse
is, um, nigh.

00:15.149 --> 00:16.184
This is my apocalyst.

00:16.217 --> 00:17.218
This is every last thing

00:17.251 --> 00:19.153
I want to do
before things go kaput.

00:19.187 --> 00:20.388
(whoops)

00:24.458 --> 00:26.094
You in?

00:26.127 --> 00:28.396
Previously on No Tomorrow...

00:28.429 --> 00:29.697
I have real feelings for you.

00:29.730 --> 00:31.299
I'm not ready for this
to be over.

00:31.332 --> 00:33.734
I do not wish to be involved
with you any longer.

00:33.767 --> 00:36.170
Will you make me
the happiest man in the world

00:36.204 --> 00:37.505
for the third time?

00:37.538 --> 00:39.173
I accept your
proposition.

00:39.207 --> 00:41.409
(Deirdre and Pete laugh)

00:41.442 --> 00:42.843
No one cares
about the math, bro.

00:42.876 --> 00:44.178
That's not your story.

00:44.212 --> 00:46.514
Xavier is.

00:46.547 --> 00:48.516
Theoretically,
if I had been dishonest...

00:48.549 --> 00:49.750
Sorry, I wasn't
listening.

00:49.783 --> 00:51.585
I was just researching
Evie's boyfriend.

00:51.619 --> 00:52.586
Fernie?

00:54.288 --> 00:56.290
Without Fern's skilled
money-raising efforts,

00:56.324 --> 00:58.192
you are now manning
a sinking ship.

00:58.226 --> 01:01.695
He's not who
he says he is.

01:01.729 --> 01:04.298
His name isn't even
Xavier Holliday.

01:04.332 --> 01:05.866
Oh, my God.

01:05.899 --> 01:07.368
Who the hell are you?

01:11.872 --> 01:14.275
You lied to me.

01:14.308 --> 01:16.277
Your real name is
Hamish Stegner, Jr.,

01:16.310 --> 01:18.346
and you have a
criminal record?

01:18.379 --> 01:20.348
Why wouldn't you
tell me any of this?

01:20.381 --> 01:22.216
(chuckles)
Look, I needed a fresh start,

01:22.250 --> 01:23.651
so I changed my name.

01:23.684 --> 01:26.254
And that rap sheet?

01:26.287 --> 01:28.189
Eight arrests in five months?

01:28.222 --> 01:30.358
Yeah, okay, so there's
a little light trespassing,

01:30.391 --> 01:33.394
some disorderly conduct and
a splash of public indecency,

01:33.427 --> 01:35.496
but, I mean,
this is pretty normal

01:35.529 --> 01:37.365
youthful rebellion
where I'm from.

01:37.398 --> 01:39.200
Well, I'm trying to figure out
who you are.

01:39.233 --> 01:40.334
Oh, come on.
I don't know if you're Xavier

01:40.368 --> 01:41.869
or Hamish...
Relax.

01:41.902 --> 01:43.637
...or some kind of con man.
Relax.

01:43.671 --> 01:45.539
No, I came to you, giving you
the benefit of the doubt,

01:45.573 --> 01:47.341
hoping for an explanation,

01:47.375 --> 01:49.843
and you're acting like
I'm being irrational.

01:49.877 --> 01:52.646
Yeah, because this stuff
just isn't relevant anymore.

01:52.680 --> 01:55.683
And when the clock is ticking,
what is the point of...

01:55.716 --> 01:56.884
of digging up the past?

01:56.917 --> 01:58.586
I think it matters.

01:58.619 --> 01:59.920
Well, I promise you,

01:59.953 --> 02:02.290
it just doesn't.

02:05.426 --> 02:07.428
Then I just...

02:07.461 --> 02:10.264
I need some time to think.

02:10.298 --> 02:12.300
(both sigh)

02:15.469 --> 02:17.905
EVIE: It's kind of
unforgiveable, right?

02:17.938 --> 02:19.940
If you found out
Sofia used to be...

02:19.973 --> 02:21.575
a diamond smuggler
named Angelina...

02:21.609 --> 02:24.578
You just described one of
our role-play scenarios,

02:24.612 --> 02:26.280
like, scary accurately.

02:26.314 --> 02:27.515
You're not helping.

02:27.548 --> 02:29.950
I know. Sorry.

02:29.983 --> 02:32.453
But honestly I think
I'd give Sofia a free pass.

02:32.486 --> 02:33.687
Apart from the fact that

02:33.721 --> 02:35.523
my brother hates me
and maybe always will,

02:35.556 --> 02:39.293
I can't believe how much
I like being engaged.

02:39.327 --> 02:41.829
Ugh, after witnessing Deirdre
accept Three-Pete's proposal,

02:41.862 --> 02:45.233
that word sounds like scissors
in a garbage disposal.

02:45.266 --> 02:47.335
She divorced him twice already.

02:47.368 --> 02:49.470
Like, it's so obvious that
she should clearly be with...

02:49.503 --> 02:50.704
DEIRDRE:
Hank, Kareema,

02:50.738 --> 02:52.840
Evie.

02:52.873 --> 02:54.708
I just got off the phone
with Corporate,

02:54.742 --> 02:56.677
and they are concerned
that it will be difficult

02:56.710 --> 02:58.479
to get CyberHugs back on track,

02:58.512 --> 03:01.682
now that we've been
so callously burned by Fern.

03:01.715 --> 03:03.284
(whispers):
#FernBurn.

03:03.317 --> 03:04.785
Well, it will definitely
be an uphill battle,

03:04.818 --> 03:08.522
but I am confident we can
turn CyberHugs back around.

03:08.556 --> 03:09.757
Indeed.

03:09.790 --> 03:12.393
I told them you were so inspired
by my thoughtful leadership

03:12.426 --> 03:14.262
that you've already
started vetting

03:14.295 --> 03:16.397
a splashy new charity
for CyberHugs.

03:16.430 --> 03:17.365
What?

03:17.398 --> 03:19.433
Corporate will be here
in a matter of days

03:19.467 --> 03:20.434
to note your progress.

03:20.468 --> 03:22.370
Chop, chop.

03:22.403 --> 03:24.872
Ugh.

03:24.905 --> 03:26.240
Was that weird?

03:26.274 --> 03:28.242
It seemed weird.

03:28.276 --> 03:30.411
Can I have your bacon?

03:30.444 --> 03:31.612
(whispers):
Okay.

03:31.645 --> 03:33.414
Yeah, I know these terrariums

03:33.447 --> 03:35.449
build a better future

03:35.483 --> 03:37.651
for the tree frogs,
but what if they start

03:37.685 --> 03:39.753
to deny where they came from?

03:39.787 --> 03:43.491
So, I think I speak for everyone
when I say, how can I trust you?

03:43.524 --> 03:45.426
Your logo is
how people know you.

03:45.459 --> 03:47.828
It's... it's who you are.

03:47.861 --> 03:50.498
You can't just change
who you are.

03:50.531 --> 03:52.600
Got a little Xav
on the brain?

03:52.633 --> 03:54.435
Possibly.
HANK:
You know what I've noticed

03:54.468 --> 03:56.437
since taking over your
quality control job?

03:56.470 --> 03:59.507
What, the dollies in fulfillment
are always sticky?

03:59.540 --> 04:00.508
Yeah, that.
I know.

04:00.541 --> 04:02.576
But, um, but, also,

04:02.610 --> 04:04.512
you have to think
super logically all day.

04:04.545 --> 04:05.879
And that rational
brain of yours

04:05.913 --> 04:07.648
has been on sleep mode
for a couple months.

04:07.681 --> 04:10.584
Strap in, fire it up,
tackle this Xavier thing

04:10.618 --> 04:12.920
with some cold,
hard Evie logic.

04:13.921 --> 04:17.358
And... still nothing.

04:17.391 --> 04:20.027
Dude, I'm on hour 19
of radio silence from Evie.

04:20.060 --> 04:22.863
New name,
criminal record--

04:22.896 --> 04:24.398
it's a bit of a bombshell, man.

04:24.432 --> 04:26.434
You got to let her soak
on that for awhile.

04:26.467 --> 04:28.769
So I changed my name?
People do it all the time.

04:28.802 --> 04:30.571
Woody Allen.
Jon Stewart.

04:30.604 --> 04:31.572
Pink.

04:31.605 --> 04:32.873
Xavier Holliday is who I am,

04:32.906 --> 04:34.908
and it's who
she fell in love with.

04:34.942 --> 04:38.312
Hamish Stegner, Jr.,
is about as relevant as...

04:38.346 --> 04:40.548
as this Romney
campaign poster.

04:40.581 --> 04:42.616
Dude...

04:42.650 --> 04:43.784
how good does
this guy look now?

04:43.817 --> 04:44.652
Yeah.

04:44.685 --> 04:47.888
Look, I think Evie
just feels duped,

04:47.921 --> 04:49.423
like she doesn't know
the real you,

04:49.457 --> 04:51.525
so just show her that she does.

04:51.559 --> 04:53.561
Yeah.

04:57.565 --> 04:59.567
(drums and electric guitar
playing outside)

05:04.672 --> 05:06.674
XAVIER:
Hey.

05:06.707 --> 05:10.344
I know that you feel betrayed,

05:10.378 --> 05:13.581
and I know that you feel like
you don't know me,

05:13.614 --> 05:15.349
and I am here

05:15.383 --> 05:18.352
to tell you that you do.

05:18.386 --> 05:23.056
I am that same guy
who you jumped off a cliff with.

05:24.658 --> 05:27.861
I'm the same guy
who wrote you street poetry,

05:27.895 --> 05:31.965
and I am the same guy
who turns up at your house

05:31.999 --> 05:33.834
and does spontaneous stuff

05:33.867 --> 05:37.805
to remind you
to live in the moment.

05:37.838 --> 05:39.873
And that's why I brought in

05:39.907 --> 05:43.143
Seattle's premier Whitesnake
cover band, Albino Cobra,

05:43.176 --> 05:45.379
to play a private concert

05:45.413 --> 05:46.747
just for you on your lawn.

05:46.780 --> 05:48.549
Xavier...
And before you
say anything,

05:48.582 --> 05:49.850
we have the
noise permits.

05:49.883 --> 05:51.885
Xavier.

05:51.919 --> 05:53.521
You're right.

05:53.554 --> 05:55.856
You have shown me
how to live in the moment.

05:55.889 --> 06:01.529
I've had more fun since
I met you than... well, ever.

06:01.562 --> 06:04.632
But then I took
another look at everything.

06:04.665 --> 06:08.736
You told me your mom died
while you were in college.

06:08.769 --> 06:10.538
The dates of those arrests,

06:10.571 --> 06:12.506
they're right after
her death, aren't they?

06:12.540 --> 06:16.076
Yeah. I was broken
and I acted out.

06:16.109 --> 06:18.646
And your name,
Hamish Stegner, Jr.--

06:18.679 --> 06:20.581
it's clear that you changed it
because of your father

06:20.614 --> 06:24.184
and, you know, whatever went on
between you two.

06:24.217 --> 06:26.920
Look, it's a messy,
complicated story.

06:26.954 --> 06:28.956
Yeah, and I asked you
to tell it.

06:28.989 --> 06:31.925
I begged you to...

06:31.959 --> 06:33.827
and you wouldn't.

06:33.861 --> 06:34.862
Hey.

06:34.895 --> 06:36.530
Fine.

06:36.564 --> 06:38.098
Fine, then ask me
whatever you want.

06:38.131 --> 06:39.767
No, it's-it's too late.

06:39.800 --> 06:42.703
You know, I've had this...

06:42.736 --> 06:46.640
this wave of rationality
finally hit me.

06:46.674 --> 06:49.943
You lied about your debt,
your past, your name,

06:49.977 --> 06:52.580
and you just shrugged
it all off.

06:52.613 --> 06:55.583
You know, I can't be the girl
in the romcom

06:55.616 --> 06:56.684
who overlooks serious issues

06:56.717 --> 06:58.886
just because the guy
is charming.

07:00.988 --> 07:03.591
You've convinced yourself
the past doesn't matter

07:03.624 --> 07:05.726
because you're afraid
to confront it.

07:05.759 --> 07:08.195
You need to face
your mother's death

07:08.228 --> 07:10.964
and whatever happened
with your dad.

07:10.998 --> 07:14.935
I was just... I don't know,

07:14.968 --> 07:16.770
waiting for the right time.
I don't know.

07:16.804 --> 07:20.674
You tell everyone to face their
fears while there's still time,

07:20.708 --> 07:22.510
but you refuse to face yours.

07:22.543 --> 07:23.711
(clears throat)

07:23.744 --> 07:27.748
Look, our pasts
make us who we are,

07:27.781 --> 07:29.750
and you're in denial of yours.

07:29.783 --> 07:32.085
(sighs)

07:32.119 --> 07:36.089
I can't be with someone who
refuses to be his whole self.

07:38.659 --> 07:41.128
This is over, Xavier.

07:49.002 --> 07:51.905
Thanks for joining me.

07:51.939 --> 07:54.842
I needed a post-breakup
drinking buddy.

07:54.875 --> 07:55.909
TIMOTHY:
How about two?

07:55.943 --> 07:57.978
I invited T-Time.

07:58.011 --> 08:00.080
Since we're all fresh
out of relationships,

08:00.113 --> 08:02.650
I thought it was time to reunite
Destiny's Child.

08:02.683 --> 08:05.786
Yeah, the broken
hearts club version.

08:05.819 --> 08:07.154
We are survivors.

08:07.187 --> 08:09.122
We are irreplaceable.

08:09.156 --> 08:12.760
So, let's rack up some bills,
bills, bills at this bar.

08:16.697 --> 08:18.832
I don't know if I can
keep on survivin', guys.

08:18.866 --> 08:21.201
I'm drawn to Deirdre
like a magnet,

08:21.234 --> 08:23.604
but now she's more
off-limits than ever.

08:23.637 --> 08:24.805
How do I fix it?

08:24.838 --> 08:27.741
Like, how do you
turn off a magnet?

08:27.775 --> 08:30.077
Well, in some cases,
the polarity.
(phone vibrates)

08:30.110 --> 08:32.179
Hello?

08:32.212 --> 08:33.747
DEIRDRE:
Come over right now.

08:33.781 --> 08:35.683
I need you.
Oh, okay.

08:35.716 --> 08:37.585
Magnet fixed.

08:37.618 --> 08:39.653
You guys just do whatev...

08:43.624 --> 08:44.992
(Evie chuckles)

08:45.025 --> 08:46.760
* Almost forgot to breathe...

08:46.794 --> 08:49.597
Uh, hey, listen...

08:49.630 --> 08:51.031
I hope you know that

08:51.064 --> 08:52.966
when I gave you that
information on Xavier,

08:53.000 --> 08:55.603
I wasn't trying to...
Oh, I know.

08:55.636 --> 08:56.870
But I'm glad I found out.

08:56.904 --> 08:58.338
You know, it...

08:58.371 --> 09:00.774
forced me to confront a
few things that, honestly,

09:00.808 --> 09:03.911
I had been avoiding
for too long.

09:03.944 --> 09:06.847
In fact... uh...

09:06.880 --> 09:10.250
Hey, uh, can you throw
this away for me? Thanks.

09:10.283 --> 09:12.753
What? No more apocalysting?

09:12.786 --> 09:15.155
That was Xavier's thing.

09:15.188 --> 09:19.026
I need to figure out
who I am without him.

09:19.059 --> 09:23.196
Well, independent woman,
what's your first step?

09:23.230 --> 09:25.733
I don't know.
What did you do when...

09:25.766 --> 09:28.201
When Fern,
the maniacal embezzler,

09:28.235 --> 09:29.202
ditched me for Uruguay?

09:29.236 --> 09:32.873
I spent eight hours
on my couch in my underwear

09:32.906 --> 09:36.343
watching a
Grocers' Blowout marathon.

09:36.376 --> 09:39.112
BOTH:
You got souped!

09:39.146 --> 09:40.247
(both laughing)

09:40.280 --> 09:41.782
That was our show.
Mm.

09:41.815 --> 09:43.383
Is Emerald Sitay
still the host?

09:43.416 --> 09:46.086
Yeah, she's celebrating her,
like, 45th year there.

09:46.119 --> 09:47.955
(laughs)
CROWD: Grocers' Blowout!

09:47.988 --> 09:50.223
Oh, my gosh,
what a woman.
Mm.

09:50.257 --> 09:52.192
Remember when I looked
into being a contestant?

09:52.225 --> 09:54.061
But the wait list
was, like, three years,

09:54.094 --> 09:55.796
so you never signed up.

09:55.829 --> 09:59.166
You know what, I'm putting my
name on that wait list today.

09:59.199 --> 10:04.171
In three years I am
winning Grocers' Blowout.

10:04.204 --> 10:05.305
Well, good for you.

10:05.338 --> 10:07.140
(both chuckle)

10:10.143 --> 10:12.145
DEIRDRE (groaning):
Oh, God.

10:14.014 --> 10:15.148
Hi, Hank.

10:15.182 --> 10:17.184
I have a cold.

10:17.217 --> 10:18.919
(coughs)
You called me over here

10:18.952 --> 10:20.287
to take care of your sick self?

10:20.320 --> 10:21.922
That's Pete's job now.

10:21.955 --> 10:23.156
Pete's in Wenatchee,

10:23.190 --> 10:25.125
scouting orchards
for the wedding.

10:25.158 --> 10:28.328
He really wants people
to toast our marriage

10:28.361 --> 10:30.664
with freshly-pressed cider.
(coughs)

10:30.698 --> 10:32.032
Oh, that's great.
Have a good one.

10:32.065 --> 10:33.300
No, no, Hank.

10:33.333 --> 10:34.301
(sighs)

10:34.334 --> 10:36.269
I know our former romance

10:36.303 --> 10:38.672
muddies this request,
but you are the one person

10:38.706 --> 10:39.973
I need right now.

10:40.007 --> 10:41.008
(sighs)

10:44.344 --> 10:48.015
As my assistant, you never took
a single sick day.

10:48.048 --> 10:50.851
Which means you're either
a statistical outlier

10:50.884 --> 10:53.887
or you have discovered how to
fortify the human immune system.

10:53.921 --> 10:55.889
Maybe I have, maybe I haven't.

10:55.923 --> 10:57.357
Why can't you just
ride this out?

10:57.390 --> 11:01.328
This is the week Archie Fieri
visits the warehouse.

11:01.361 --> 11:02.462
The fire inspector?

11:02.495 --> 11:03.663
DEIRDRE: He's the toughest
fire inspector

11:03.697 --> 11:06.299
in Seattle's history;
some say it's because

11:06.333 --> 11:08.435
he lost his eyebrows
in a terrible fire.

11:08.468 --> 11:12.405
And I am the only one who knows
how to avoid his fines.

11:12.439 --> 11:14.107
Then just reschedule.

11:14.141 --> 11:17.110
Archie Fieri
reschedules for no one.

11:17.144 --> 11:19.780
That's actually written
on his business card.

11:19.813 --> 11:22.082
And he has the power to
shut down the warehouse

11:22.115 --> 11:23.951
until it's up to code.

11:23.984 --> 11:25.418
My warehouse.

11:25.452 --> 11:27.287
All right, all right.

11:27.320 --> 11:29.890
The Barkley family
does have a secret recipe

11:29.923 --> 11:31.725
for germ annihilation.

11:31.759 --> 11:33.160
It's called vitamin B13.

11:33.193 --> 11:35.362
It's like vitamin B12,
but, you know,

11:35.395 --> 11:37.464
there's one more "B."

11:37.497 --> 11:38.932
I'll make it for you tomorrow.

11:38.966 --> 11:40.167
What's in it?

11:40.200 --> 11:41.902
Uh... better if you didn't know.

11:41.935 --> 11:43.270
My stuff with my dad

11:43.303 --> 11:45.238
has nothing to do
with our relationship.

11:45.272 --> 11:47.107
But she thinks
we can't really be together

11:47.140 --> 11:49.743
until I address it,
but that's not her call to make.

11:49.777 --> 11:51.244
Exactly.

11:51.278 --> 11:53.313
If you cared about
this thing with your dad,

11:53.346 --> 11:55.315
it'd be on that
lyst of yours.

11:55.348 --> 11:57.250
"Talk to my dad"
is number three.

11:57.284 --> 12:00.220
Oh.
Yeah.

12:00.253 --> 12:03.456
I just recently read about
this fringe therapist

12:03.490 --> 12:05.325
who believes you
shouldn't confront trauma

12:05.358 --> 12:08.495
until at least a decade
after it's happened.

12:08.528 --> 12:11.231
So, just wait till then.

12:11.264 --> 12:14.334
Right, except that,
at the ten-year mark,

12:14.367 --> 12:17.104
the Earth will be a smoldering
piece of space rubble.

12:17.137 --> 12:19.272
(whispers):
Yeah.

12:19.306 --> 12:21.174
You're running out of excuses
for me to use, huh?

12:21.208 --> 12:24.477
Really struggling here, yeah.

12:24.511 --> 12:26.013
Listen, I get that
you're afraid...

12:26.046 --> 12:28.048
I'm not afraid of
talking to my dad.

12:28.081 --> 12:29.850
It's simply that
it would require me

12:29.883 --> 12:32.119
to address some deep-seated
emotional damage

12:32.152 --> 12:35.288
that I would rather not explore
at this juncture.

12:38.992 --> 12:40.794
Yeah, I just heard myself, too.

12:40.828 --> 12:41.962
Yeah.

12:44.297 --> 12:46.299
(camera clicking)

12:51.438 --> 12:54.975
(camera clicking)

12:55.008 --> 12:57.110
Thank you for letting me

12:57.144 --> 12:57.911
crash your lunch break.

12:57.945 --> 12:59.546
I think I'm gonna
call this series

12:59.579 --> 13:03.216
"Warehouse Faces: A Study
of Capitalist Oppression."

13:06.553 --> 13:08.421
Uh-oh. What's wrong with
my immigration paperwork?

13:08.455 --> 13:11.524
It says here that the I.N.S. is
gonna look into my work history,

13:11.558 --> 13:13.426
including
performance evaluations.

13:13.460 --> 13:15.829
So?
So...

13:15.863 --> 13:18.165
I barely try at this job.

13:18.198 --> 13:20.067
I mean, I've never looked
at my evaluations,

13:20.100 --> 13:22.002
but I'm sure
they say things like,

13:22.035 --> 13:24.304
"Kareema barely tries
at this job."

13:27.274 --> 13:30.110
Well, maybe it's not too late
to turn it around.

13:30.143 --> 13:32.145
Make sure you get
some good customer reviews

13:32.179 --> 13:33.480
before the end of next week.

13:33.513 --> 13:36.149
(sighs):
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

13:36.183 --> 13:38.251
You def deserve a full refund
on that hair spray.

13:38.285 --> 13:41.989
I am sending you
a shipping label right now.

13:42.022 --> 13:44.124
Ooh, Cedar Rapids.

13:44.157 --> 13:47.594
See ya later, Iowa-Stater.
(giggles)

13:47.627 --> 13:50.497
You've definitely never been
that nice on a call before.

13:50.530 --> 13:53.400
Ugh, niceness is exhausting.

13:53.433 --> 13:56.103
No wonder you stay so thin
without exercising.

13:56.136 --> 13:57.304
Did you find

13:57.337 --> 13:59.106
a splashy charity yet?

13:59.139 --> 14:00.473
I did.
Uh, Forks in the Road.

14:00.507 --> 14:02.275
It's actually
a really neat organization

14:02.309 --> 14:04.111
that delivers fresh food
to the homeless.

14:04.144 --> 14:06.179
I used to volunteer
for them in college.

14:06.213 --> 14:10.083
I'm not afraid of
digging into my past.

14:10.117 --> 14:11.885
You know, I can see actual waves

14:11.919 --> 14:13.887
of passive aggression
emanating from you right now.

14:13.921 --> 14:15.655
Sorry.
I'm just frustrated.

14:15.688 --> 14:18.992
This was just
delivered to me.

14:20.093 --> 14:21.895
What does it mean?

14:21.929 --> 14:24.297
It means Xavier
still doesn't get it.

14:24.331 --> 14:26.399
He thinks he can win me over
with big gestures,

14:26.433 --> 14:28.435
like they're some kind of drug
I'm hooked on.

14:28.468 --> 14:30.170
Anyone have any codeine?

14:32.239 --> 14:33.573
You keep your codeine in a can?

14:33.606 --> 14:35.142
What do you keep yours in?

14:41.481 --> 14:43.450
(sighs)

14:43.483 --> 14:47.654
(line ringing)

14:47.687 --> 14:50.390
OPERATOR:
Mathematics Department.

14:50.423 --> 14:52.926
Hi. Uh, Professor Stegner,
please.

14:52.960 --> 14:54.962
(phone clicks, beeps)

14:55.963 --> 14:57.998
HAMISH:
This is Hamish speaking.

14:58.031 --> 15:00.033
Hi, Dad.

15:06.139 --> 15:07.140
(knocks)

15:07.174 --> 15:09.309
Hi.
Hi. Um...

15:12.245 --> 15:13.546
Look, I... I know

15:13.580 --> 15:15.182
it can't be easy
for you right now.

15:15.215 --> 15:16.649
It's... it's not easy
for me either.

15:16.683 --> 15:18.218
But, you know,
trying to win me back

15:18.251 --> 15:20.020
with another adventure
just won't help anything.

15:20.053 --> 15:21.221
Evie, I'm not trying
to win you back.

15:21.254 --> 15:22.555
I know you think
it's charming.

15:22.589 --> 15:24.224
Evie, I-I don't...

15:24.257 --> 15:27.027
I don't know who sent this
to you, but it wasn't me.

15:27.060 --> 15:29.029
And, look, I'm really
happy to see you,

15:29.062 --> 15:30.730
but your timing
isn't great.

15:30.763 --> 15:32.265
I called my dad last night.

15:32.299 --> 15:34.601
And we've
arranged to meet.

15:34.634 --> 15:37.204
He's on his way
here right now.

15:37.237 --> 15:39.339
Wow. So you actually did it.

15:39.372 --> 15:40.673
(sighs) Yeah.

15:40.707 --> 15:42.542
And the hardest part's
still to come.

15:42.575 --> 15:44.744
Well, you'll get through it.

15:44.777 --> 15:46.313
You know, I have faith.

15:47.780 --> 15:49.549
Yeah, well, look.

15:49.582 --> 15:53.020
Have fun on whatever
adventure awaits you.

15:53.053 --> 15:55.989
Maybe you can tell me
about it later.

16:01.594 --> 16:02.962
(sighs):
Oh, my God.

16:08.701 --> 16:11.071
You haven't
changed a bit, son.

16:13.173 --> 16:14.374
Dad.

16:17.077 --> 16:20.080
(both grunt)

16:20.113 --> 16:22.749
XAVIER:
I apologize.

16:22.782 --> 16:24.551
It's just,
I've been fantasizing

16:24.584 --> 16:27.087
about doing that
for a very long time.

16:27.120 --> 16:30.357
Yeah, well, I hope it was
everything you dreamed of.

16:34.594 --> 16:36.063
You brought her.

16:36.096 --> 16:38.665
Yeah.

16:38.698 --> 16:41.368
I think you deserve her.

16:42.769 --> 16:45.405
I'm gonna make some proper tea.

16:47.407 --> 16:49.409
Hello?

16:50.810 --> 16:53.146
Did the B13 work?

16:53.180 --> 16:54.547
DEIRDRE:
Hank!

16:54.581 --> 16:56.783
Whoa!

16:56.816 --> 16:58.685
Sweet Snowden's Wi-Fi!

16:58.718 --> 17:00.753
I have hives, vertigo

17:00.787 --> 17:03.256
and a grotesquely swollen
ear canal.

17:03.290 --> 17:06.093
Are you sure
you made the B13 correctly?

17:06.126 --> 17:08.328
Yes. Okay, okay.

17:08.361 --> 17:10.797
Yeah. I put codeine, garlic,
keyboard cleaner,

17:10.830 --> 17:13.066
a teaspoon
of powdered kumquat.

17:13.100 --> 17:14.501
Ah! Allergic to kumquat.

17:14.534 --> 17:16.236
What are we gonna do?
Okay, all right.

17:16.269 --> 17:19.106
First, just, you know,
let yourself go.

17:19.139 --> 17:21.074
Just let gravity have
its way with you, girl.

17:21.108 --> 17:23.110
All right? Okay.

17:23.143 --> 17:25.145
There you go.
Look at that.
(groans)

17:25.178 --> 17:28.148
The floor's
like a big pillow.

17:28.181 --> 17:30.350
Listen. Let me show
Archie around, all right?

17:30.383 --> 17:32.819
Just teach me how
to get everything ready

17:32.852 --> 17:34.587
and answer his trick questions.

17:34.621 --> 17:37.090
(gasps)

17:37.124 --> 17:41.628
I saw a motion picture
on cable television yesterday.

17:41.661 --> 17:44.597
It's called Roxanne.

17:44.631 --> 17:48.801
What if I fed you the answers
like in Roxanne?

17:48.835 --> 17:50.137
Like Cyrano de Bergerac.

17:50.170 --> 17:51.538
Please, don't speak French
around me.

17:51.571 --> 17:53.173
You know how I feel
about that country.

17:55.142 --> 17:58.678
I like the
window treatments.

17:58.711 --> 18:01.381
They're very,
uh... breezy.

18:03.216 --> 18:05.585
I don't want to talk
about the windows.

18:05.618 --> 18:08.521
I want to talk about
what you did.

18:08.555 --> 18:11.258
Well, I thought we might just
kind of ramp up to that.

18:11.291 --> 18:12.692
Well, I've been

18:12.725 --> 18:14.794
ramping up to that
for nine years, so...

18:14.827 --> 18:16.196
(phone vibrating)

18:16.229 --> 18:17.897
Oh, I'm so sorry.

18:17.930 --> 18:20.367
I told her to only call
if it was an emergency,

18:20.400 --> 18:22.135
so this might be.

18:22.169 --> 18:24.437
Hi. Is everything okay?

18:24.471 --> 18:26.906
Oh, hi, Zoey. Yes.

18:26.939 --> 18:29.909
I can do your homework with you
when I get back to the hotel,

18:29.942 --> 18:31.444
but I'm in the middle
of something right now,

18:31.478 --> 18:32.445
so I've got to go.

18:32.479 --> 18:34.381
Bye-bye.

18:34.414 --> 18:37.217
Are you kidding me?

18:37.250 --> 18:39.219
You brought them to Seattle?

18:39.252 --> 18:41.454
Well, I... I thought
that if this went well,

18:41.488 --> 18:42.922
you might want to meet them.

18:42.955 --> 18:44.624
Oh, my God.

18:44.657 --> 18:47.460
I don't remember
you helping me with my homework.

18:47.494 --> 18:49.329
Or anything,
for that matter.

18:49.362 --> 18:51.231
I remember looking after Mom

18:51.264 --> 18:52.665
when you were nowhere
to be found,

18:52.699 --> 18:54.234
because you were starting
a new family with Rose,

18:54.267 --> 18:55.935
and having Zoey,
who, by the way,

18:55.968 --> 19:00.173
was born five months
after Mom died.

19:00.207 --> 19:03.910
I... I had to watch Mom die
all on my own.

19:03.943 --> 19:06.846
Once again
you made it very clear

19:06.879 --> 19:09.416
which family
actually matters to you.

19:13.953 --> 19:16.155
(clears throat)

19:28.468 --> 19:30.470
*

19:36.276 --> 19:38.278
(sighs)

19:55.262 --> 19:56.863
EVIE:
We bought that map

19:56.896 --> 19:59.566
at a city planning fair
four years ago.
(sighs)

19:59.599 --> 20:02.369
Okay. I was worried you weren't
gonna put it together.

20:02.402 --> 20:05.805
Timothy Finger
and Evie Covington, checking in.

20:05.838 --> 20:07.474
Okay, go on in.

20:07.507 --> 20:08.875
How'd you make this happen?
Do you remember

20:08.908 --> 20:10.477
that video of me
at the STEVEN-Spiel?

20:10.510 --> 20:12.379
I've always felt--
Oh, good Lord!

20:12.412 --> 20:16.616
Well, it's resulted in
some mild local notoriety.

20:16.649 --> 20:18.885
So I leveraged
that notoriety

20:18.918 --> 20:21.454
to help us cut the wait list
to be a contestant on...

20:21.488 --> 20:23.723
ALL:
Grocers' Blowout!

20:23.756 --> 20:26.326
ANNOUNCER:
With Emerald Sitay.

20:26.359 --> 20:27.660
(audience cheering)

20:27.694 --> 20:29.462
(laughs)

20:29.496 --> 20:31.298
KAREEMA: Kareema,
queen of customer care.

20:31.331 --> 20:32.632
How can I help you?

20:32.665 --> 20:34.301
Uh-huh.

20:34.334 --> 20:35.635
Ooh, that sounds bad.

20:35.668 --> 20:37.036
I can send you a return
shipping label.

20:37.069 --> 20:39.005
What's your address?

20:39.038 --> 20:41.608
Hey. Uh, I'm gonna run around
the warehouse and check

20:41.641 --> 20:43.810
all the emergency exit signs.
You want to help?

20:43.843 --> 20:45.412
I can't.

20:45.445 --> 20:47.514
Customers have started
requesting me.

20:47.547 --> 20:50.283
I'm a Cybermart siren;
it's a nightmare.

20:50.317 --> 20:51.684
(computer dings)
Ugh.

20:51.718 --> 20:53.620
And now they're gonna
reward me for it.

20:53.653 --> 20:55.422
I do such idiotic things
for love.

20:55.455 --> 20:57.290
And sex.

20:57.324 --> 20:58.758
Mostly sex.

20:58.791 --> 21:01.761
Yeah. Well, if you can't
help me, where's Evie?

21:01.794 --> 21:03.330
I don't know;
she's still on her lunch break.

21:03.363 --> 21:04.230
Still?

21:04.263 --> 21:06.299
What kind of lunch
takes so damn long?

21:06.333 --> 21:08.368
(buzzers sounding)
Bananas flambÃ©.

21:08.401 --> 21:09.502
Waldorf Salad.

21:09.536 --> 21:10.570
Orville Redenbacher.

21:11.804 --> 21:13.573
Mm! Yes!
CROWD:
Oh!

21:13.606 --> 21:14.941
(crowd laughs)

21:14.974 --> 21:17.410
Still Life with Fruit and Ham.

21:17.444 --> 21:19.512
The portable juice box!

21:19.546 --> 21:21.414
Got one!
(applause)

21:21.448 --> 21:23.750
Ah! Ooh! I got one, too!

21:23.783 --> 21:24.917
(cheering)

21:24.951 --> 21:26.386
Final question.

21:26.419 --> 21:29.889
Whoever gets this
wins a $200 gift certificate

21:29.922 --> 21:34.060
good at any Seattle bar
or restaurant.

21:34.093 --> 21:35.362
(audience oohing)

21:35.395 --> 21:38.965
Four of the most
powerful families

21:38.998 --> 21:44.604
in ancient Rome took their names
from what kind of food?

21:44.637 --> 21:45.738
(gasps)
(dinging)

21:45.772 --> 21:47.474
Beans!

21:47.507 --> 21:50.410
Yes!
Evie!

21:50.443 --> 21:52.579
You are wrong!
(buzzer sounds)

21:52.612 --> 21:54.046
Timothy, for the steal.

21:54.080 --> 21:55.815
That would be legumes.

21:55.848 --> 21:56.983
(dinging)

21:57.016 --> 21:58.485
(laughs)

21:58.518 --> 22:00.487
(audience cheering)

22:00.520 --> 22:03.790
Tim Finger,
you are today's winner!

22:05.425 --> 22:07.560
Evie.

22:07.594 --> 22:09.496
As today's loser...

22:10.763 --> 22:12.365
(siren wailing)

22:12.399 --> 22:13.766
(screams, laughs)

22:16.503 --> 22:19.739
EMERALD AND AUDIENCE:
You got souped!

22:19.772 --> 22:22.709
(audience cheering)

22:22.742 --> 22:24.411
(coughs)

22:24.444 --> 22:26.746
That was a blast!
(laughs)

22:26.779 --> 22:29.115
Yeah, I thought
you might like that.

22:29.148 --> 22:31.451
And...

22:31.484 --> 22:33.686
I think you should cross it off.

22:33.720 --> 22:35.455
What? I...

22:35.488 --> 22:36.589
I threw this away.

22:36.623 --> 22:40.026
Yeah. I... I had
the bartender fish it out.

22:40.059 --> 22:42.562
I know it's
a Xavier thing. I know.

22:42.595 --> 22:45.598
But... but he didn't
make that list. You did.

22:45.632 --> 22:47.166
And it made you really happy.

22:47.199 --> 22:49.536
Maybe you don't need

22:49.569 --> 22:51.604
to throw out the baby
with the bathwater.

22:55.542 --> 22:58.110
Thank you, Timothy.

22:59.979 --> 23:01.981
*

23:06.853 --> 23:08.788
Ooh. You got some parsley
in your hair.

23:08.821 --> 23:10.623
(chuckles):
Oh.

23:10.657 --> 23:12.759
(chuckles)

23:12.792 --> 23:14.527
Hey, this was fun.

23:14.561 --> 23:16.863
Mm-hmm.
Let me know if you ever want

23:16.896 --> 23:18.965
to cross off
a couple more together.

23:18.998 --> 23:20.800
(chuckles)

23:25.638 --> 23:27.840
I tried, Mom.

23:27.874 --> 23:31.511
I really tried.

23:31.544 --> 23:34.013
(exhales) I swear,
he doesn't even realize

23:34.046 --> 23:36.182
how much he abandoned us.

23:39.752 --> 23:42.054
(sniffles)
ROSE:
Xavier?

23:45.257 --> 23:47.894
(clears throat)

23:47.927 --> 23:50.096
May I? Please?

23:50.129 --> 23:51.698
Yep. Fine.

23:51.731 --> 23:54.601
But I'm not subjecting
my mother to this.

23:57.704 --> 23:59.572
I know you
don't like me.

23:59.606 --> 24:01.808
I know you'll
always think of me

24:01.841 --> 24:03.009
as your father's mistress.

24:03.042 --> 24:06.713
Yeah, well, it's a pretty fair
thing to think, isn't it?

24:06.746 --> 24:10.149
Did Hamish ever tell you
where he met me?

24:10.182 --> 24:12.685
Uh, nope. Never came up in the
nine years we weren't speaking.

24:12.719 --> 24:14.153
We met in
a support group

24:14.186 --> 24:16.823
for people with
terminally ill loved ones.

24:16.856 --> 24:20.593
It was the absolute worst year
of our lives.

24:20.627 --> 24:22.995
We'd go to those meetings
and drink the cheap tea

24:23.029 --> 24:26.265
and listen to sad sacks
as miserable as we were.

24:26.298 --> 24:29.268
But it was a way
to avoid going home.

24:29.301 --> 24:32.772
I needed him at home.

24:32.805 --> 24:35.207
I know.

24:35.241 --> 24:37.744
And that's for you two
to work out.

24:37.777 --> 24:40.780
But I also know that we both
felt like we were sinking

24:40.813 --> 24:43.182
and we needed something,

24:43.215 --> 24:45.785
someone to hold onto.

24:45.818 --> 24:48.888
And, in our misery,
we found each other.

24:51.123 --> 24:54.727
Yeah, well, it's not how it
looks from where I'm sitting.

24:54.761 --> 24:57.263
If you think your father
didn't care about your mom,

24:57.296 --> 25:00.733
then you two really do
need to talk.

25:00.767 --> 25:03.870
What Hamish and I have
is special.

25:03.903 --> 25:06.906
But Tabitha was his true love.

25:08.741 --> 25:11.510
She'll always be
the light of his life.

25:13.312 --> 25:16.015
He say that?

25:16.048 --> 25:18.651
He say she was
the light of his life?

25:24.190 --> 25:27.026
I'm not supposed
to tell you this,

25:27.059 --> 25:29.996
but do you know what your
father's missing to be here?

25:38.771 --> 25:41.974
Well, somebody has the bounce
back in their pounce.

25:42.008 --> 25:44.577
Did you have a little sex
with the ex with an "X"?

25:44.611 --> 25:46.178
No. Nothing like that.

25:46.212 --> 25:48.815
I just... had a lot
of fun recently.

25:48.848 --> 25:51.183
With Timothy, actually.

25:51.217 --> 25:52.585
And I never should have
underestimated

25:52.619 --> 25:54.587
how much I love lists.

25:54.621 --> 25:56.155
Goal-setting is
so my jam.

25:56.188 --> 25:58.157
WOMAN:
Kareema?

25:58.190 --> 26:00.026
We need to talk.
Oh! Right.

26:00.059 --> 26:01.293
If I've gotten
some sort of award

26:01.327 --> 26:03.062
for Best Customer Service Ever,

26:03.095 --> 26:06.198
you can just fax a copy
of the certificate to the I.N.S.

26:06.232 --> 26:08.968
The only thing
I'll be faxing to the I.N.S.

26:09.001 --> 26:11.170
is a sad face emoji

26:11.203 --> 26:13.272
to represent how your quality
of work has plummeted

26:13.305 --> 26:15.141
recently.
Plummeted?

26:15.174 --> 26:16.609
You were the crown jewel

26:16.643 --> 26:18.310
of the customer service
department.

26:18.344 --> 26:20.847
The sturdiest cog
in the machine.

26:20.880 --> 26:23.816
Are you sure you
mean Kareema?

26:23.850 --> 26:24.917
Yeah, are you sure?

26:24.951 --> 26:26.118
You kept
phone call lengths

26:26.152 --> 26:27.787
to a record minimum.

26:27.820 --> 26:31.157
You were extremely strict
about returns on used items.

26:31.190 --> 26:32.959
The ideal customer service rep.

26:32.992 --> 26:34.060
Wha...?

26:34.093 --> 26:36.763
But I thought I was improving
the quality of my work.

26:36.796 --> 26:39.165
I don't even know
who you are anymore.

26:39.198 --> 26:41.634
By the way,
someone from Corporate

26:41.668 --> 26:43.803
is waiting for you
in the conference room.

26:43.836 --> 26:45.638
(gasps) Great.
I'll just check in

26:45.672 --> 26:47.373
with my contact at
Forks in the Road.

26:47.406 --> 26:50.009
You know, maybe he's
stuck in traffic.

26:50.042 --> 26:52.945
Yeah.

26:52.979 --> 26:54.280
I don't understand.

26:54.313 --> 26:56.315
You were so excited
about partnering with CyberHugs.

26:56.348 --> 26:59.018
We were gonna be
Fork Dorks together.

26:59.051 --> 27:00.820
I just saw you on TV.

27:00.853 --> 27:03.355
You wasted at least
30 gallons of soup.
Excuse me?

27:03.389 --> 27:06.325
You know how many hungry people
could've eaten that soup?

27:06.358 --> 27:07.794
(line beeps)

27:07.827 --> 27:10.663
(exhales)

27:10.697 --> 27:11.964
I am so screwed.

27:11.998 --> 27:13.065
Not nailed.

27:13.099 --> 27:14.400
Per specifications.

27:14.433 --> 27:16.135
Well done.

27:16.168 --> 27:17.770
DEIRDRE (over earpiece):
Good job.
(grunts)

27:17.804 --> 27:20.406
So, you guys obviously do a lot
of restocking around here.

27:20.439 --> 27:22.108
How much aisle space
do you leave

27:22.141 --> 27:23.943
in case of
an emergency evacuation?

27:23.976 --> 27:27.379
DEIRDRE: It depends if it's
manual or mechanical restocking.

27:27.413 --> 27:31.050
(voice breaks):
Uh... manual or mechanical?

27:31.083 --> 27:32.418
Let's say mechanical.

27:32.451 --> 27:34.153
44 inches.

27:34.186 --> 27:36.122
44 inches.

27:36.155 --> 27:38.124
Uh, just give me one moment.

27:38.157 --> 27:40.426
Just... one moment.

27:40.459 --> 27:43.095
(panting)

27:43.129 --> 27:44.396
(quietly):
I am so sorry.

27:44.430 --> 27:46.065
I thought that hearing
your voice electronically

27:46.098 --> 27:47.934
would offset the effect
it had on me,

27:47.967 --> 27:51.470
but your illness has made
your voice even huskier,

27:51.503 --> 27:53.906
and it's elevating Douglas.

27:53.940 --> 27:55.407
I got to wing it.

27:55.441 --> 27:57.777
No, no, no, no.
Hank, no!

27:57.810 --> 27:59.678
(sighs)

28:01.480 --> 28:03.983
And if it's, uh,
manual restocking?

28:04.016 --> 28:05.718
How much aisle space then?

28:05.752 --> 28:08.888
This much?

28:08.921 --> 28:11.423
ARCHIE: $800 fine.
(gasps)

28:11.457 --> 28:14.260
Thanks for giving me
another chance

28:14.293 --> 28:16.328
to explain this to you.

28:16.362 --> 28:18.164
Why didn't you tell me
that you won

28:18.197 --> 28:20.399
the Waldo Weinberg
Mathematician of the Year Award?

28:21.433 --> 28:23.469
The award ceremony was last
night. Why didn't you tell me?

28:23.502 --> 28:25.838
It wasn't important.

28:25.872 --> 28:27.406
Wasn't important?

28:27.439 --> 28:30.109
You spent half my childhood
chasing that award.

28:30.142 --> 28:31.778
I remember sitting
in the university

28:31.811 --> 28:33.279
by the copy machine
while you made copies

28:33.312 --> 28:34.446
of invariant theory.

28:34.480 --> 28:37.016
This means more.

28:37.049 --> 28:39.351
You, your mother.

28:39.385 --> 28:40.920
It all means more.

28:43.923 --> 28:46.525
I'm sorry, Xavier.

28:46.558 --> 28:50.029
I just didn't have the strength
to watch my soul mate fade away,

28:50.062 --> 28:52.865
one little piece
at a time.

28:52.899 --> 28:55.234
Yeah, well, what about me?

28:55.267 --> 28:57.103
(sighs)

28:58.337 --> 29:02.408
You know, Rose said that
you needed someone to cling to.

29:02.441 --> 29:05.244
So did I.

29:05.277 --> 29:08.314
I was all alone,
right in the thick of it.

29:08.347 --> 29:09.849
I was selfish.

29:09.882 --> 29:13.185
But I was searching for solace.

29:13.219 --> 29:15.855
And I found it
somewhere unexpected.

29:19.058 --> 29:20.559
Yeah, well...

29:20.592 --> 29:24.163
I guess I can relate to that.

29:24.196 --> 29:27.533
I was recently dating this girl

29:27.566 --> 29:32.038
who said that I was running away
from what I feared.

29:34.173 --> 29:37.343
(chuckles softly)
Guess it runs in the family, eh?

29:37.376 --> 29:38.510
Yeah.

29:38.544 --> 29:41.547
Fear can make us
do some things we regret.

29:46.185 --> 29:48.054
(sighs)
Look, I...

29:48.087 --> 29:52.024
I don't know if I'm ready
to bury the hatchet.

29:55.227 --> 29:57.897
But maybe we could
start digging the hole.

30:01.067 --> 30:03.836
I was gonna...

30:03.870 --> 30:07.039
(sighs)
spread Mom's ashes tonight.

30:07.073 --> 30:09.275
Don't know
if you wanted to join.

30:09.308 --> 30:12.544
It would be
the highest honor of my life.

30:14.446 --> 30:16.148
Honestly.

30:24.223 --> 30:26.225
Son, where's your mother?

30:32.498 --> 30:35.101
Hey. Um, there's no way

30:35.134 --> 30:37.169
you could go meet Corporate
with me right now

30:37.203 --> 30:39.338
and pretend to be
a representative from, say,

30:39.371 --> 30:41.941
the American Heart Association,
is there?

30:41.974 --> 30:43.943
No. I got to un-return
these returns

30:43.976 --> 30:46.378
and get back my bad name.

30:46.412 --> 30:48.881
(gasps)

30:48.915 --> 30:51.183
EVIE:
Okay, uh...

30:51.217 --> 30:54.086
I need a plan. Even if
it's a crazy one. I could...

30:54.120 --> 30:56.222
Run around and...
and flap your arms.

30:56.255 --> 30:58.590
ARCHIE: Flapping one's arms
is the last thing

30:58.624 --> 31:01.093
you should encourage a
burning individual to do.

31:01.127 --> 31:03.195
$1,000 fine.

31:03.229 --> 31:04.363
(sighs)

31:04.396 --> 31:06.365
Now, show me to
the cubicles.

31:06.398 --> 31:08.667
Sure. They're just right o...

31:08.700 --> 31:11.003
Jiminy Fire Hazard!

31:11.037 --> 31:13.439
Give me one moment. Evie!

31:13.472 --> 31:14.606
Mm?

31:14.640 --> 31:16.042
Why does Kareema currently have

31:16.075 --> 31:17.243
the most flammable
desk situation

31:17.276 --> 31:19.345
in the entire history
of Cybermart?

31:19.378 --> 31:22.281
Oh, 'cause she wants to make a
good impression with the I.N.S.,

31:22.314 --> 31:24.116
so she's...
Okay, you know
what? Never mind.

31:24.150 --> 31:26.385
Just hide all that stuff
before the fire inspector sees.

31:26.418 --> 31:28.287
Yeah. Right. Yeah. Uh...

31:28.320 --> 31:31.390
So. Archie. Arch.

31:31.423 --> 31:33.159
Um...

31:33.192 --> 31:35.294
you know, I think
it would be good for you

31:35.327 --> 31:39.298
to just, you know, open up,
just tell a... long...

31:41.433 --> 31:42.701
...long story.

31:42.734 --> 31:44.670
Like about that fire where

31:44.703 --> 31:46.338
you lost your...

31:46.372 --> 31:48.074
your eyebrows.

31:48.107 --> 31:50.709
Is that what people say?
Yeah.

31:50.742 --> 31:52.411
I just have alopecia.
Wait.

31:52.444 --> 31:53.645
You have alopecia?

31:53.679 --> 31:55.247
My favorite cousin Chauncey

31:55.281 --> 31:57.316
has alopecia.
We used to have a magic act,

31:57.349 --> 32:00.019
and he'd make me draw on
his eyebrows before every show.

32:00.052 --> 32:01.620
(laughs)
No kidding.
Yeah. Yeah.

32:01.653 --> 32:03.655
Did he use felt-tip,
or-or permanent marker?

32:03.689 --> 32:05.557
Hmm.

32:05.591 --> 32:08.227
(both sigh)

32:08.260 --> 32:11.297
I can't believe this whole time
I've been a cog in the machine.

32:11.330 --> 32:13.399
A sturdy cog.

32:13.432 --> 32:15.434
Well, even if you are
a corporate drone,

32:15.467 --> 32:17.436
you'll always be
a rebel to me.

32:17.469 --> 32:19.271
That means nothing
coming from you.

32:19.305 --> 32:21.273
You're, like,
the droniest of drones.

32:21.307 --> 32:23.976
No offense.
Yeah, well,

32:24.010 --> 32:26.078
I'm about to do
something very undroney.

32:26.112 --> 32:28.114
Corporate's waiting for me
in the conference room, and

32:28.147 --> 32:29.681
I have nothing to
present for CyberHugs.

32:31.450 --> 32:34.420
Would a box of used junk impress
our overlords?

32:34.453 --> 32:38.190
Just because it's used doesn't
necessarily mean it's junk.

32:38.224 --> 32:39.425
(gasps)

32:40.626 --> 32:42.261
Cybermart keeps looking

32:42.294 --> 32:44.230
for charities
to align itself with,

32:44.263 --> 32:46.632
but it has its own charity
right here,

32:46.665 --> 32:49.168
built into
its very infrastructure.

32:49.201 --> 32:53.005
I was recently reminded
not to throw the baby out

32:53.039 --> 32:54.606
with the bathwater.

32:54.640 --> 32:57.309
What if we asked customers

32:57.343 --> 33:00.612
to repurpose delivery boxes
as donation boxes?

33:00.646 --> 33:03.182
They could fill them up
with old clothes,

33:03.215 --> 33:05.051
toys, even canned food,

33:05.084 --> 33:07.286
and a Cybermart delivery person
in the area would take it

33:07.319 --> 33:09.688
to a nearby shelter
or donation center.

33:09.721 --> 33:12.458
We could call it
"Getters and Givers."

33:13.759 --> 33:17.096
It's not bad.

33:17.129 --> 33:19.665
It would barely cost us anything
to set in motion, and...

33:19.698 --> 33:22.468
it would be quite the PR boon.

33:24.770 --> 33:29.541
For someone that smells like
soup, you've got good ideas.

33:31.277 --> 33:34.180
I can't believe that

33:34.213 --> 33:36.415
you packed your own mother
into a bunch of fireworks.

33:36.448 --> 33:38.784
As you get to know me
better, it'll become easier

33:38.817 --> 33:41.220
to believe.
(sighs)

33:41.253 --> 33:43.689
Mom loved fireworks.

33:43.722 --> 33:46.292
She really did.
It's a fitting tribute.

33:46.325 --> 33:49.195
You know, this is a
hydroelectric dam.

33:49.228 --> 33:51.163
Yeah.

33:51.197 --> 33:52.598
Which means that
her ashes will enter

33:52.631 --> 33:55.401
into the energy system
of this entire city.

33:55.434 --> 33:58.204
A tiny little
micro particle of her

33:58.237 --> 34:01.107
in every lit
light bulb in Seattle.

34:01.140 --> 34:02.708
(both chuckle softly)

34:02.741 --> 34:05.244
I'll be able to see her
wherever I go.

34:05.277 --> 34:06.745
Yeah.

34:06.778 --> 34:08.647
(sighs)

34:13.319 --> 34:16.054
*

34:24.496 --> 34:26.498
(laughs)

34:37.909 --> 34:39.578
Please put me in
touch with your cousin.

34:39.611 --> 34:41.113
It sounds like we'd have
so much to talk about.

34:41.147 --> 34:42.848
Absolutely. You two
should start a podcast.

34:42.881 --> 34:45.417
No Hair, Don't Care
with Archie and Chauncey.

34:45.451 --> 34:48.086
(both laugh)

34:51.923 --> 34:55.194
You know, I'm really not
supposed to do this,

34:55.227 --> 34:57.596
but I don't want
$7,500 in fines

34:57.629 --> 34:59.865
to complicate this
friendship we've developed.

34:59.898 --> 35:03.135
I totally agree, man.
But please

35:03.169 --> 35:04.403
brush up on the
fire code, okay?

35:04.436 --> 35:06.638
Will do.

35:07.906 --> 35:09.641
Hey, nicely done.

35:09.675 --> 35:11.777
What?
Yeah! Well, we should, um...

35:11.810 --> 35:15.647
we should celebrate
our personal victories.

35:15.681 --> 35:17.349
Want to do drinks at Horsemen's?

35:17.383 --> 35:19.451
It's so late. I should
go check on Deirdre.

35:19.485 --> 35:21.853
Yeah. And I'm meeting
Sofia, so...

35:21.887 --> 35:24.256
Oh.

35:34.400 --> 35:35.567
You were incredible.

35:35.601 --> 35:37.169
(laughs)

35:37.203 --> 35:38.737
Who would have thought
that appealing

35:38.770 --> 35:41.373
to a fellow professional
on a personal level

35:41.407 --> 35:43.542
would create such
a helpful sense of rapport?

35:43.575 --> 35:45.544
I'm sorry I had to ditch you,

35:45.577 --> 35:48.447
but your sore throat
took your vocal prowess

35:48.480 --> 35:50.349
to an unexpected 11.

35:50.382 --> 35:54.553
No, I take full responsibility
for that. I...

35:54.586 --> 35:57.223
With our history,
I never should have put you

35:57.256 --> 35:59.925
in the position where
I was deep inside your ear.

36:02.861 --> 36:05.163
Well, I should
probably head out.

36:06.598 --> 36:08.867
I dated David Copperfield.

36:11.437 --> 36:13.805
What?!

36:16.007 --> 36:20.312
I heard you talk about
sawing your cousin in half.

36:20.346 --> 36:22.481
I actually urged Dave
to saw a man in half

36:22.514 --> 36:26.218
as I felt constantly
sawing women was

36:26.252 --> 36:29.655
such a dangerous anti-feminist
metaphor, and, you know, well,

36:29.688 --> 36:32.291
we broke up
shortly after that.

36:32.324 --> 36:34.593
Were you there when he made
the Statue of Liberty disappear?

36:34.626 --> 36:37.929
He originally wanted
to do the Staten Island Ferry.

36:37.963 --> 36:40.966
I said, "Dave, think bigger."

36:40.999 --> 36:42.634
(laughing):
Oh, my God!

36:42.668 --> 36:44.936
I can't believe we've
never talked magic before.

36:44.970 --> 36:47.873
It's one of my favored
conversation topics.

36:47.906 --> 36:50.676
I got so excited when
I heard you mention your act.

36:50.709 --> 36:52.678
I want to hear
everything about it.
Okay.

36:52.711 --> 36:54.880
Well, we started off
with a reverse trick.
Oh.

36:54.913 --> 36:57.649
So we pulled a hat
out of a... a...

36:59.351 --> 37:00.986
We shouldn't be doing this.

37:01.019 --> 37:02.488
Well, we're just talking.

37:02.521 --> 37:03.989
No. You're engaged.

37:04.022 --> 37:06.425
We can't be tempting ourselves
like this.

37:06.458 --> 37:08.394
You know, it's not fair to Pete,

37:08.427 --> 37:10.562
or to us.

37:10.596 --> 37:12.964
I'm glad you're feeling better.

37:17.369 --> 37:19.771
(door closes)

37:19.805 --> 37:21.807
(Evie sighs)

37:23.675 --> 37:26.345
Hey, you made it.

37:26.378 --> 37:28.046
I can't believe
you want to waste

37:28.079 --> 37:30.716
my Grocers' Blowout
prize money

37:30.749 --> 37:32.518
at Four Horsemen's.

37:32.551 --> 37:34.720
Okay, first off,
it's not prize money.

37:34.753 --> 37:36.622
It's a gift certificate.

37:36.655 --> 37:38.557
Secondly, Four Horsemen is
an incredible establishment.

37:38.590 --> 37:40.025
Otherwise, we wouldn't
keep coming back.

37:40.058 --> 37:43.562
And thirdly, since you're paying
with said gift certificate,

37:43.595 --> 37:47.599
it's time to try...
the unlabeled bottle.

37:53.872 --> 37:55.874
(sighs)

37:55.907 --> 37:57.876
Hey.

37:59.077 --> 38:00.646
(groans)

38:00.679 --> 38:03.449
Aah!

38:03.482 --> 38:05.717
It tastes like pine needles
and lighter fluid.

38:05.751 --> 38:07.753
(exhaling)

38:07.786 --> 38:10.356
It's... that's accurate.

38:10.389 --> 38:12.424
Oh.
Aah.

38:16.728 --> 38:17.663
HAMISH:
So it's back

38:17.696 --> 38:20.499
to the hotel and then
straight to the airport.

38:20.532 --> 38:22.601
Well, uh,
I'm really glad you came.

38:22.634 --> 38:25.070
Me, too. And you
be sure to thank

38:25.103 --> 38:27.573
that incredibly smart woman
for getting you to call me.

38:27.606 --> 38:29.875
Yeah, I will.

38:29.908 --> 38:31.877
Look, I know that
communication's not exactly

38:31.910 --> 38:34.746
our strong suit, but maybe
we could speak once a week.

38:34.780 --> 38:36.848
Monday nights.

38:36.882 --> 38:41.487
Yeah. Yeah, I think
I could manage that.

38:41.520 --> 38:44.923
Well, I'll talk
to you soon, son.

38:44.956 --> 38:46.592
(sighs)

38:46.625 --> 38:49.060
Just in case
I never see you again.

38:50.095 --> 38:51.830
What?

38:51.863 --> 38:54.400
You never know.

38:56.935 --> 38:59.371
Bye.

39:00.906 --> 39:02.374
(sighs)

39:02.408 --> 39:04.042
(car door closes)

39:04.075 --> 39:06.478
(car engine starts)

39:18.624 --> 39:21.527
(chuckles)

39:21.560 --> 39:24.996
Ah. You know, I thought for
sure you were going to pass.

39:25.030 --> 39:27.599
Why would I pass?
I knew the answer.

39:27.633 --> 39:29.968
All beans are legumes,

39:30.001 --> 39:32.137
but not all legumes
are beans.
(laughing)

39:32.170 --> 39:35.173
Yeah, well, you know, the old
Timothy would have passed,

39:35.206 --> 39:37.876
just to spare me the humiliation
of getting

39:37.909 --> 39:39.144
souped.

39:39.177 --> 39:41.112
Well, I'm not
old Timothy anymore.

39:41.146 --> 39:43.014
Yeah, I've noticed.

39:43.048 --> 39:45.651
You know, you and I have
so much history together,

39:45.684 --> 39:48.954
and yet you still have
the capacity to surprise me.

39:48.987 --> 39:52.190
Well, you surprise me.

39:52.223 --> 39:56.161
And honestly

39:56.194 --> 39:58.597
I've been pretty inspired by it.

40:03.234 --> 40:06.638
Am I your rebound?

40:06.672 --> 40:09.107
Because I'm not
necessarily opposed.

40:09.140 --> 40:12.878
You're not, you're
not my rebound.

40:12.911 --> 40:16.114
We're just living
in the moment.

40:19.217 --> 40:21.052
This is Evie.

40:21.086 --> 40:22.654
I'm not here right now,
but I can't wait

40:22.688 --> 40:24.055
to hear whatever
you're about to tell me.

40:24.089 --> 40:25.524
(laughing): Thanks.
(beep)

40:25.557 --> 40:27.893
Hey, Evie, it's, um... it's me.

40:27.926 --> 40:30.061
Um... my dad just left.

40:30.095 --> 40:32.531
It was... occasionally terrible,

40:32.564 --> 40:34.533
(chuckling):
but also kind of amazing.

40:34.566 --> 40:36.167
You were right.

40:36.201 --> 40:39.204
I... I didn't want my past
to matter, but...

40:39.237 --> 40:41.907
but it's part of me.

40:41.940 --> 40:44.242
And it's everywhere.

40:44.275 --> 40:46.745
Um, you know,
when I called my dad, I....

40:46.778 --> 40:49.214
I wanted to do it for you,
but he got here,

40:49.247 --> 40:52.083
and then I realized
I needed to do it for me.

40:52.117 --> 40:56.154
And I... I feel like I'm just
closer to being my whole self.

40:56.187 --> 40:59.190
Uh, look, this is too much
to say over the phone,

40:59.224 --> 41:00.559
so let's just meet up.

41:00.592 --> 41:02.528
There's literally
no one else on Earth

41:02.561 --> 41:06.898
I'd rather talk to right now.

41:06.932 --> 41:09.568
(sighs)

41:09.601 --> 41:11.136
(phone chimes)

41:11.169 --> 41:14.740
