00:00.147 --> 00:02.916
What's up, people?
Welcome to "The Marlon Way."

00:02.917 --> 00:04.651
Me and my ex-wife, Ashley,
when we parent,

00:04.652 --> 00:07.333
we do it differently.
See, I keep it real,

00:07.334 --> 00:09.368
and she keeps it real emotional.

00:09.369 --> 00:11.403
And when Ashley cries, like most women,

00:11.404 --> 00:12.772
it comes in four stages.

00:12.773 --> 00:14.706
Stage one: Heavy breathing.

00:14.707 --> 00:17.642
[breathing deeply]

00:17.643 --> 00:19.544
Stage two: [gasps]

00:19.545 --> 00:23.181
They look up into the sky
and start fanning their eyes.

00:23.182 --> 00:25.250
Stage three: Lip sucking.

00:25.251 --> 00:28.086
[panting]

00:28.087 --> 00:31.322
Stage four is a full on, ugly cry,

00:31.323 --> 00:34.492
buttoned up with a big old
Viola Davis snot bubble.

00:34.493 --> 00:37.929
Just mucus spread all across her face.

00:37.930 --> 00:41.966
See, men, when we cry,
we do it real cool, like Denzel.

00:41.967 --> 00:47.772
Just one tear rolling down
our cheek with no expression.

the hospital is cold.

01:05.624 --> 01:08.660

Oh, toilet seat covers!

Zack's surgery is outpatient.
He'll be home in a few hours.

01:22.241 --> 01:24.943
I just like to be prepared.
Plus, it keeps me distracted

01:24.944 --> 01:28.112
from thinking about
how fragile Zack is.

01:28.113 --> 01:31.049
It's a bird! It's a plane!

jiggling him around.

01:41.861 --> 01:44.015
Oh, what's the matter?
Mommy's jiggle-jealous?

01:44.146 --> 01:45.883
Come here. I got you girl. Come here.

01:46.240 --> 01:46.998
Oh, ya.

01:46.999 --> 01:48.781
- Put me down.
- Remind you of something?

01:48.782 --> 01:49.855
Marlon!

01:51.085 --> 01:53.159
Okay, listen, he was
just a little nervous

01:53.160 --> 01:56.062
about going to the hospital,
so I just wanted to remind him

01:56.063 --> 01:58.998
that superheroes aren't
afraid of anything, right?

01:58.999 --> 02:00.833
What are we gonna do
to that bone infection?

02:00.834 --> 02:04.037
We're kicking the bone infection's ass!

02:04.038 --> 02:05.671
Ahem.

02:05.672 --> 02:08.775
Hey, what'd I tell you
about saying the word "ass"?

02:08.776 --> 02:11.444
Nothing.

02:11.445 --> 02:14.480
You know, me and you could
never rob a bank together.

02:14.481 --> 02:17.550
Zack, you're only gonna need
these crutches...

02:17.551 --> 02:18.951
[voice breaking]
For a couple more days.

02:18.952 --> 02:23.656
Oh, my God. [mock sobbing]

02:23.657 --> 02:24.857
You see that? The heavy breathing?

02:24.858 --> 02:28.194
[mock sobbing and speaks gibberish]

02:28.195 --> 02:30.730
- Stage one of the ugly cry.
- [laughs]

02:30.731 --> 02:33.066
I'm glad you guys think this is funny,

02:33.067 --> 02:34.834
but my baby's having surgery.

02:34.835 --> 02:36.636
Are you sure this isn't gonna hurt?

02:36.637 --> 02:38.604
Honey, remember, it's like
we talked about, right?

02:38.605 --> 02:41.174
The doctor's just gonna make
a small incision in your leg.

02:41.175 --> 02:42.975
He's gonna clean out the infection.

02:42.976 --> 02:44.243
You'll be on antibiotics
for a couple day...

02:44.244 --> 02:48.114
Boy, you gon' be high as hell.

02:48.115 --> 02:49.482

02:49.483 --> 02:51.817

Whitney fall in love.

Look, you gon' be home by 9:00.

02:55.422 --> 02:58.564
I'ma be beating your behind in
"John Madden Football" by 9:05.

02:58.565 --> 03:01.661
Zach, you're good... I prayed on it.

03:02.001 --> 03:04.088
My god is a mighty healer.

I holla at you the last
time I needed something.

03:15.576 --> 03:19.659
God knows my heart, and you
can trust and believe that.

03:19.660 --> 03:23.863
I trust and believe God's

"Is that Yvette?

03:32.773 --> 03:36.343
Jesus loves me. This I know.

03:36.344 --> 03:38.545
Um, I think that's Jesús.

03:40.247 --> 03:45.485
And he owns an auto body shop
right down there on Crenshaw.

03:45.486 --> 03:47.921
Well, Jesús fixed my
fender for half price.

03:55.830 --> 03:58.331
I'm ready. I was just making
some chocolate milk for Zack.

03:58.332 --> 04:00.333
Come on, let's race.
Let's go. Come on, come on.

04:00.334 --> 04:02.335
That's as fast as you can go?
Come on, I got you.

04:02.336 --> 04:04.504
I do that backwards.
You can't get this, boy.

04:06.874 --> 04:10.310

04:10.311 --> 04:12.812

'cause it's never nothing good.

04:16.016 --> 04:17.951
It's never like, "Hey, we need to talk.

"I think you're really cool,
and I want to give you

04:19.387 --> 04:21.321

No, it's always like,

"I saw the doctor,
and I think you should too.

04:24.959 --> 04:27.193

Marlon, I know we're only
gonna be in the hospital

04:32.133 --> 04:35.135
for six hours, but that can be
very stressful on parents.

04:35.136 --> 04:37.103
- Mm-hmm.
- And in situations like these,

04:37.104 --> 04:38.972
I also know you can be very...

04:38.973 --> 04:39.939
- Sexy?
- No.

04:39.940 --> 04:41.074
- Charismatic?
- No.

04:41.075 --> 04:43.643
- Did I say sexy?
- Marlon!

04:43.644 --> 04:45.779
This is what I'm talking about.
You being you.

04:45.780 --> 04:47.781
It reminds me of why we got divorced.

04:47.782 --> 04:50.383
Look, I was just trying to
lighten the mood for Zack, okay?

04:50.384 --> 04:51.851
He's going to surgery,
and I just wanted to, you know,

04:51.852 --> 04:53.286
make everything easy for him.

04:53.287 --> 04:54.521
And I just need to make sure

04:54.522 --> 04:56.222

19:50.828 --> 19:52.662
All right. Come on in.

19:52.663 --> 19:54.998
Keep your eyes closed.
Hey, no sneaky peaking.

19:54.999 --> 19:56.867
None of this.

19:56.868 --> 19:59.002
I see you. I know you.
I'm watching you.

19:59.003 --> 20:00.537
You did the same thing at Christmas.

20:00.538 --> 20:02.178
That's why I took them Jordans back

20:02.179 --> 20:03.840
and bought your ass some Starburys.

20:03.841 --> 20:05.208
- Marlon?
- Hmm?

20:05.209 --> 20:07.044
- What are you doing?
- Okay.

20:07.045 --> 20:09.346
It's been two weeks
since Zack's surgery,

20:09.347 --> 20:11.381
and Dr. Pepper said he's at 100%,

20:11.382 --> 20:14.017
so I want to take his
little leg on a test run.

20:14.018 --> 20:15.685
All right, you guys. Open.

20:15.686 --> 20:17.888
Both: Surprise!

20:17.889 --> 20:20.991
Bounce house!

20:20.992 --> 20:23.860
- You are out of your mind.
- Yes, I am.

20:23.861 --> 20:26.897
Hey, this way,
we can have a bounce house

20:26.898 --> 20:28.932
with the certainty it won't blow away.

20:28.933 --> 20:31.501
Well, unless somebody real fat
jump in and it just pop.

20:31.502 --> 20:33.637
Pow! [blows raspberry]

20:33.638 --> 20:35.505
[laughs]

20:35.506 --> 20:37.874
Oh! Hey!

20:37.875 --> 20:39.876
- Come on, Ash!
- Come on!

20:39.877 --> 20:41.545
- Come on in!
- Come on!

20:41.546 --> 20:43.447
- Come on, Mama.
- Come on, Mom!

20:43.448 --> 20:45.348
Make room for Mama!

20:45.349 --> 20:46.483
Yay!

20:46.484 --> 20:49.052
[laughter and cheering]

20:49.053 --> 20:51.621
[coyotes howling]

20:51.622 --> 20:53.099
[small dog barking]

20:53.178 --> 20:55.521
