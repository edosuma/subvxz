02:40.551 --> 02:41.986
Next.

02:42.054 --> 02:45.689
Excuse me, madam,
would you kindly...

02:45.756 --> 02:48.926
hand over all the money
in your register?

02:50.161 --> 02:53.964
For real? You got like
a weapon or something?

02:54.031 --> 02:55.534
Oh, heavens, no.

02:57.134 --> 02:58.269
Guard!

02:59.904 --> 03:00.971
Huh?

03:01.038 --> 03:03.640
Your electronics
are of no use, madam.

03:03.706 --> 03:06.977
I am the Gentleman Ghost.

03:16.320 --> 03:18.355
Splendid, now I must run.

03:18.422 --> 03:20.757
I have other robbery
appointments today,

03:20.824 --> 03:23.427
and a gentleman must keep
to his schedule...

03:26.729 --> 03:28.631
It's the Teen Titans.

03:28.698 --> 03:30.266
That's right.

03:30.333 --> 03:32.535
Polite language does not excuse
the doing of the crime.

03:32.601 --> 03:37.307
Yeah, if you wants money, you have to
do what we dos and mooch off Robin.

03:37.373 --> 03:39.976
No, he shouldn't do that,
you really shouldn't do that, either,

03:40.043 --> 03:42.245
but I digress, Titans, go!

03:53.755 --> 03:58.627
It seems you brutish attacks are
useless against my genteel form.

03:58.694 --> 04:00.062
His what?

04:00.129 --> 04:03.365
No, I'll just procure the money
and, umph...

04:03.432 --> 04:05.501
Well, stop that.

04:05.567 --> 04:07.202
Cut it out.

04:07.269 --> 04:10.205
Stop, that is
exceedingly annoying!

04:10.272 --> 04:14.476
Then you better surrender,
because we can be annoying all day.

04:14.543 --> 04:15.643
That is extremely true.

04:15.710 --> 04:18.045
I would like to
second the that.

04:18.113 --> 04:19.447
Hmm...

04:19.515 --> 04:21.416
So, what's it gonna be?

04:21.483 --> 04:22.683
Well...

04:26.421 --> 04:28.156
Geez Louise...

04:28.222 --> 04:30.358
<i>Stronger, faster, better...</i>

04:30.424 --> 04:33.227
- Talk about being full of yourself.
- <i>Faster...</i>

04:34.795 --> 04:35.863
Robin?

04:36.898 --> 04:38.266
Pardon me.

04:38.332 --> 04:41.835
I will be borrowing
your friend for a spell.

04:41.903 --> 04:44.071
Oh, man, the Ghost stole
the money <i>and</i> Robin.

04:44.138 --> 04:46.706
Uh, let's get at least
one of them back.

04:49.910 --> 04:52.112
Oh, excuse me, pardon me,
coming through.

04:52.179 --> 04:53.046
Move!

04:53.648 --> 04:54.714
Look!

04:56.082 --> 04:58.118
He's helping that
old lady cross the street?

04:58.185 --> 05:01.288
It's the gentlemanly
thing to do.

05:03.423 --> 05:04.291
Get him!

05:06.092 --> 05:09.429
This infant body is too weak.

05:15.669 --> 05:17.571
Oh, hello.

05:17.637 --> 05:19.673
Mmm.

05:19.738 --> 05:22.007
This has been the very droll.

05:22.074 --> 05:23.876
But I must be going.

05:23.943 --> 05:25.911
Ta-ta, children.

05:25.978 --> 05:28.080
Not happening.

05:31.183 --> 05:32.818
Impressive.

05:34.086 --> 05:35.821
Don't even think about it.

05:39.225 --> 05:40.326
Raven?

05:43.495 --> 05:45.264
Well, I never...

05:45.331 --> 05:46.931
Ugh...

05:47.765 --> 05:51.070
Ooh, my specialty.

05:51.136 --> 05:52.371
Perfect.

05:54.373 --> 05:56.174
Uh, Raven?

05:58.743 --> 06:00.278
Don't mind if I do.

06:01.946 --> 06:04.482
Possession is nine-tenths
of the law, after all.

06:16.694 --> 06:18.229
Oh, my.

06:30.841 --> 06:31.709
Goodness.

06:43.954 --> 06:46.156
Is this good or bad?

06:48.925 --> 06:51.461
Oh, bother,
it looks like you got me.

06:51.528 --> 06:55.165
- Guess I'll head off to...
- ghost jail.

07:00.870 --> 07:01.738
Raven?

07:14.317 --> 07:16.819
Sorry, I lost it there
for a second.

07:16.886 --> 07:17.953
What happened?

07:18.654 --> 07:21.657
That was... awesome!

07:21.724 --> 07:22.957
What was?

07:23.025 --> 07:24.226
I didn't even know
you could do that.

07:24.293 --> 07:25.094
Do what?

07:25.161 --> 07:27.062
You totally wrecked that dude.

07:32.668 --> 07:34.570
That is not awesome, it's bad.

07:34.637 --> 07:37.872
Friend Raven, if you are having
the trouble with your powers,

07:37.939 --> 07:39.908
we are all the here for you.

07:39.974 --> 07:41.309
Yeah, well, you're
not half-demon.

07:41.376 --> 07:43.211
So I don't think
you'd understand.

07:43.278 --> 07:46.981
Whatever. You're welcome I
re-killed that old man. Later.

08:05.165 --> 08:09.637
Hello, creepy dark
inner consciousness.

08:30.357 --> 08:31.225
Ugh.

08:32.726 --> 08:35.227
What's happening to me?

08:37.263 --> 08:39.932
What's happening is,
it's time to ditch those humans.

08:39.999 --> 08:41.200
Dad?

08:42.803 --> 08:44.671
You.

08:44.738 --> 08:48.074
And also, ditch Starfire, the alien,
and whatever Robin is, uh, wombat?

08:48.141 --> 08:50.076
Not gonna happen,
get out of here.

08:52.011 --> 08:56.549
But, sweetie, I came to congratulate
you, your gem is cracking.

08:56.616 --> 08:58.885
Then, you know
what's happening to me?

08:58.950 --> 09:02.688
That gem on your forehead is
what contains your inner demon.

09:04.390 --> 09:07.092
<i>But now that it's cracked
your demon can escape.</i>

09:07.159 --> 09:10.395
<i>And consume your
human side, entirely.</i>

09:10.463 --> 09:13.465
You mean,
I'm becoming a monster?

09:13.533 --> 09:14.834
You don't have to.

09:14.901 --> 09:17.837
What if I told you I could
remove your demon altogether?

09:19.471 --> 09:21.506
Then we both can have
something we've always wanted.

09:21.573 --> 09:25.243
I'll be out of your hair forever
and your powers will be mine to use.

09:26.944 --> 09:28.780
Not happening.

09:28.847 --> 09:30.482
It's your humanity.

09:30.549 --> 09:33.117
The more you use your powers,
the more the crack will widen.

09:33.185 --> 09:34.753
Until, pow!

09:34.820 --> 09:37.021
All that's left will be demon.

09:39.524 --> 09:41.660
I just won't use
my powers, then.

09:41.726 --> 09:44.663
I'd rather give them up,
than give them to you.

09:44.729 --> 09:47.131
And don't be in my mirror.

09:47.198 --> 09:49.099
- Used your powers.
- That doesn't count.

09:51.202 --> 09:53.537
Nuts, I thought that
was gonna work.

09:53.604 --> 09:57.441
Your gambit has
failed, as predicted.

09:57.508 --> 10:00.177
We proceed with the true plan.

10:00.244 --> 10:02.213
Fine, I'll get on it.

10:33.443 --> 10:35.245
<i>Robin 1.</i>

10:37.747 --> 10:39.248
When you're already best,

10:39.315 --> 10:42.251
there's only one adversary
you can face.

10:42.317 --> 10:44.052
<i>Robin 2.</i>

10:44.119 --> 10:45.454
Yourself.

10:45.522 --> 10:47.857
<i>Final Round! Round Robin!</i>

10:47.924 --> 10:48.791
<i>Fight!</i>

10:51.193 --> 10:52.594
<i>Combo.</i>

11:00.736 --> 11:01.803
<i>Triple move!</i>

11:03.205 --> 11:04.573
<i>End him!</i>

11:13.916 --> 11:15.249
Huh?

11:15.316 --> 11:17.586
<i>Why aren't you ending him?</i>

11:19.721 --> 11:20.856
Is this some
sort of cheat code?

11:20.923 --> 11:21.790
I don't understand.

11:26.761 --> 11:27.996
<i>What's happening?</i>

11:31.766 --> 11:34.068
<i>Wait, wait, what are we doing?</i>

11:34.135 --> 11:36.971
<i>This is weird, right?</i>

11:37.038 --> 11:39.407
<i>I'm very confused.</i>

11:40.575 --> 11:41.442
Ha-ha-ha.

11:42.108 --> 11:43.644
That's it!

11:43.711 --> 11:44.579
Team meeting.

11:46.112 --> 11:49.784
How would you expect me to
remain in peak physical form,

11:49.850 --> 11:52.019
if you insist on
interrupting my training?

11:52.085 --> 11:55.856
I do not know this word "peak."
It means the soft or mushy?

11:57.290 --> 11:59.459
Robin, it's not like
it's real training.

11:59.526 --> 12:01.861
Yeah, you're only fighting
against yourself.

12:01.929 --> 12:03.396
Of course I'm fighting me!

12:03.463 --> 12:05.899
I'm a super genius tactician
with good looks to match.

12:05.966 --> 12:07.400
Who could be better?

12:09.269 --> 12:11.671
I don't think there's an answer
there that you're gonna like.

12:11.738 --> 12:14.507
What we needs to do is learn
from Raven, she really...

12:14.574 --> 12:15.375
leveled up!

12:16.743 --> 12:18.078
Yeah, she did!

12:19.479 --> 12:21.213
Being bigger
and more awesome is great!

12:21.280 --> 12:22.582
Let's all level up!

12:22.649 --> 12:23.549
Easy for me!

12:29.555 --> 12:32.058
Boom! Toast-mode unlocked.

12:39.999 --> 12:40.866
Toast-mode!

12:45.804 --> 12:47.305
What is that?

12:48.507 --> 12:50.109
If these readings
are correct,

12:50.174 --> 12:53.511
something is breaking into our
universe from another Earth!

12:54.113 --> 12:55.446
What?

12:55.513 --> 12:59.018
Did any of you dummies feel...
That's new.

13:06.791 --> 13:09.327
It is the menacing
and the sparkly.

13:09.394 --> 13:10.995
I am the conflicted.

13:12.330 --> 13:13.197
Aah!

13:16.567 --> 13:17.635
Argh!

13:18.736 --> 13:19.604
Tiger claw!

13:19.671 --> 13:20.538
Lion's tail!

13:20.605 --> 13:21.472
Antelope!

13:28.980 --> 13:30.480
What are you?

13:40.223 --> 13:41.391
I did not like that.

13:41.458 --> 13:43.126
Where's even are we?

13:43.193 --> 13:44.361
Welcome, heroes!

13:53.737 --> 13:55.072
Welcome!

13:55.138 --> 13:57.841
To my arena.

13:57.908 --> 13:59.176
Who are you?

13:59.241 --> 14:01.210
Oh, I'm just a friend, ha-ha.

14:01.277 --> 14:03.814
Call me the Master of Games...

14:05.514 --> 14:09.186
Yo, unless those games come with
video, puts us back in our house!

14:09.251 --> 14:11.020
But you haven't yet
heard my offer.

14:11.088 --> 14:15.758
I have traveled throughout the
Multiverse in search of one thing!

14:15.825 --> 14:16.892
A smaller forehead?

14:16.959 --> 14:20.563
The greatest version
of every hero.

14:20.629 --> 14:23.165
What do you mean "version"?

14:23.231 --> 14:25.634
You may be the Titans
of this Earth.

14:25.701 --> 14:28.470
But there are actually
Infinite Earths...

14:28.536 --> 14:31.774
and each one is different!

14:31.841 --> 14:33.142
Wha...

14:33.209 --> 14:34.476
Uh, I get it!

14:34.542 --> 14:35.878
Here, we're heroes!

14:35.945 --> 14:37.378
But on another Earth we might
be villains,

14:37.445 --> 14:38.313
or robots,

14:38.379 --> 14:39.748
or medieval knights!

14:39.814 --> 14:43.152
Ooh! Is there an Earth
where we're all mermaids?

14:43.219 --> 14:44.986
No, those don't exist.

14:45.053 --> 14:47.155
Or a steam-punk Earth,
where we all wear goggles and top hats?

14:47.223 --> 14:49.424
Oh, yeah, with goggles
on the top hats!

14:49.491 --> 14:51.159
- No.
- Ooh-ooh, I got one!

14:51.226 --> 14:53.194
A world where
we're all animals?

14:53.260 --> 14:55.063
Yo, I be that all day
and every day!

14:55.130 --> 14:58.933
Okay. So, I'd be Cy-bunny,
who's a bunny, who's also half robot.

14:59.000 --> 15:02.536
And Starfire can be
Star-fish-fire!

15:02.603 --> 15:05.807
What about an Earth where
you became great heroes?

15:05.874 --> 15:09.043
Beloved by all!

15:09.110 --> 15:12.980
There's basically zero-percent chance
an Earth like that exists, bro.

15:13.047 --> 15:15.282
That remains to be seen.

15:15.349 --> 15:17.384
This is the Worlogog.

15:17.451 --> 15:19.586
Wallgog.

15:19.653 --> 15:23.423
<i>This marvelous
artifact shows me every possibility.</i>

15:23.490 --> 15:27.393
<i>And allows me to determine which is
the greatest version of every hero...</i>

15:27.460 --> 15:29.129
<i>through combat...</i>

15:29.196 --> 15:32.331
You want us to fight an
alternate version of ourselves?

15:32.398 --> 15:33.767
Ooh, is it the Mermaid Titans?

15:33.834 --> 15:35.803
Or those goggles guy,
with the top hats?

15:35.869 --> 15:39.639
Whichever version it is,
they won't stand a chance against us.

15:39.705 --> 15:41.808
- Hmm, won't they?
- No.

15:41.874 --> 15:43.843
- Won't they?
- I just said no.

15:43.910 --> 15:44.944
Oh, won't they?

15:45.011 --> 15:46.779
Why do you keep saying
"Won't they"?

15:46.846 --> 15:48.282
Because Robin...

15:50.683 --> 15:52.351
You've already met.

15:59.725 --> 16:01.326
Hasn't we seen them before?

16:01.393 --> 16:02.862
Their Robin is so handsome.

16:02.929 --> 16:04.429
Look at those guys.

16:04.496 --> 16:06.398
So tall...

16:06.464 --> 16:08.433
and such big hands.

16:11.904 --> 16:14.506
Wouldn't you like to battle
these other Titans?

16:14.573 --> 16:17.109
Prove that you're just
as good as they are?

16:17.176 --> 16:18.677
More than anything!

16:18.743 --> 16:20.679
Very well, Teen Titans.

16:20.745 --> 16:23.181
Face your challenges.

16:23.248 --> 16:25.650
The Teen Titans!

16:30.889 --> 16:34.926
Welcome to
the tournament of Titans!

16:34.993 --> 16:36.962
Wo-ho-ho-ho! Cool!

16:37.028 --> 16:37.896
Yeah!

16:37.963 --> 16:40.464
You ruined my childhood!

16:40.531 --> 16:42.533
I don't know,
isn't this a little suspici...

16:42.600 --> 16:43.834
This is perfect!

16:43.901 --> 16:45.669
Just what we need
to kick us up a notch.

16:45.736 --> 16:48.906
Let's prove we are the best
Titans in the Multiverse.

16:48.973 --> 16:52.543
But, Robin...
You don't understand.

16:53.143 --> 16:54.912
I can't fight.

16:54.979 --> 16:58.249
Aw, I wouldn't say "can't,"
you're just not as good as I am.

16:58.315 --> 16:59.783
But then who is?

16:59.850 --> 17:01.552
Them?

17:01.619 --> 17:04.188
They're the serious
versions of us.

17:05.789 --> 17:08.224
Uh, I'm pretty sure we're
the serious versions of us.

17:08.291 --> 17:11.560
No, check it out,
you can tell by how tall they are.

17:11.627 --> 17:13.829
See? He's like five heads tall.

17:13.897 --> 17:16.699
Now, look at your short self,
three heads, tops.

17:16.766 --> 17:18.867
And you also have
the tiny baby hands.

17:18.935 --> 17:20.770
We've moved past
my little baby hands!

17:20.837 --> 17:24.641
Point is, more tall
means more serious.

17:24.707 --> 17:28.044
Both teams will square off
in an all-out rumble.

17:28.111 --> 17:30.380
Throw your opponents
out of the ring

17:30.446 --> 17:32.582
and victory will be yours.

17:32.649 --> 17:35.184
Let the tournament begin!

17:37.887 --> 17:40.890
Remember, we have to play along
with this to save our Earth.

17:40.957 --> 17:43.226
Don't go too hard on those
baby versions of us.

17:43.293 --> 17:44.294
Ow!

17:44.360 --> 17:45.929
"Baby versions?" I heard that!

17:45.995 --> 17:48.897
Okay, maybe
rough them up a little.

17:48.964 --> 17:51.667
Don't worry,
we'll show them how it's done.

18:20.594 --> 18:22.097
- Hey.
- 'Sup?

18:23.631 --> 18:25.633
Look, I don't know
what to call you.

18:27.336 --> 18:29.103
Would you rather "Toy Robin"?

18:31.339 --> 18:32.441
"Shorter Robin"?

18:32.506 --> 18:33.975
"Bobblehead Robin"?

18:38.679 --> 18:40.915
Whoa, settle down, guy.

18:42.817 --> 18:45.186
This is all just a silly game
to you guys, isn't it?

18:45.252 --> 18:46.220
Whoo!

18:46.287 --> 18:48.122
Ah, almost got me!

18:53.860 --> 18:56.529
Oh, so you are
the Starfire of your Earth.

18:56.596 --> 18:58.432
On your Earth,
do you have a Silkie?

18:58.498 --> 18:59.833
I do.

18:59.899 --> 19:01.601
How much of the Earth food
do you consume?

19:01.668 --> 19:04.771
As much as will fit
in my nine stomachs.

19:04.838 --> 19:06.172
Feed me...

19:06.239 --> 19:07.741
I am the same!

19:15.681 --> 19:17.450
I gotta say,
not psyched about this fight.

19:17.516 --> 19:18.985
Oh?

19:19.052 --> 19:21.054
I spent a lot of time battling
my own inner demons.

19:21.121 --> 19:23.223
This is kind of
annoyingly literal.

19:23.289 --> 19:25.057
Yeah, tell me about it.

19:30.829 --> 19:32.197
What is your problem?

19:32.264 --> 19:34.166
This tournament must be
a trap of some kind.

19:35.901 --> 19:38.904
The Master of Games
obviously cannot be trusted.

19:38.971 --> 19:41.707
You should obviously avoid
my fist in your face!

19:49.348 --> 19:50.581
Now we're talking.

19:50.648 --> 19:52.917
Yeah, three heads,
you show that tall dummy.

19:57.156 --> 19:59.090
Glitter bomb!

19:59.158 --> 20:00.392
Is this a joke?

20:00.459 --> 20:02.060
You'd think that, but then
a few months from now

20:02.126 --> 20:03.594
you'll still be finding
glitter in your house.

20:03.661 --> 20:05.730
And you'll be all,
"Curse that other Cyborg!

20:05.797 --> 20:07.031
Handsome devil."

20:12.170 --> 20:15.039
We should be working together
to figure out what is going on.

20:15.106 --> 20:18.042
We'll never join you.

20:18.109 --> 20:19.844
Have it your way.

20:24.048 --> 20:25.550
Loser!

20:25.615 --> 20:29.187
Ladies and gentlemen,
we have our first elimination.

20:29.253 --> 20:30.620
I love you so much!

20:34.157 --> 20:35.025
The what?

20:36.394 --> 20:38.361
Time to bring out the big guns.

20:42.632 --> 20:44.201
Ha, nice try!

20:45.769 --> 20:48.538
Oh, come on! Is there anything
you do that's not horrible?

20:48.604 --> 20:51.141
I don't know,
how do you like this?

20:51.208 --> 20:52.576
Ow, stop that!

20:52.641 --> 20:54.511
- This is weird.
- Give up then.

20:54.578 --> 20:55.945
Not a chance.

20:56.679 --> 20:58.081
Booyah!

20:58.148 --> 20:59.382
That's my line.

20:59.449 --> 21:00.317
Mine first.

21:02.651 --> 21:04.321
Loser.

21:04.387 --> 21:06.789
Hey, foul, dude.
You put me together wrong.

21:06.856 --> 21:08.724
I'm an actual butt-head.

21:08.791 --> 21:09.825
Ho-ho, there it is.

21:09.892 --> 21:11.461
That's two to zero.

21:11.528 --> 21:12.895
We's looking like chumps, yo.

21:12.962 --> 21:14.530
Star, yous gotta do something!

21:14.598 --> 21:15.599
Ah!

21:15.664 --> 21:17.366
Oh, yes! The battle.

21:17.433 --> 21:18.767
Hmm.

21:20.536 --> 21:23.072
Glorious!

21:23.139 --> 21:27.243
One, two, three, four,
we declare the thumb war.

21:52.133 --> 21:53.001
Classic.

22:06.880 --> 22:08.316
I am the victorious.

22:10.418 --> 22:11.553
Way to go, Star!

22:11.619 --> 22:12.654
Loser.

22:14.622 --> 22:18.025
Same side!
We're both green! Ah!

22:18.091 --> 22:18.959
Hmm.

22:28.569 --> 22:29.835
Hmm?

22:35.242 --> 22:37.611
Aw, I can't squash
this little guy.

22:37.678 --> 22:39.346
Look at him.

22:39.413 --> 22:43.115
Boom! Now you gots a
whale in yo face, fool.

22:43.182 --> 22:44.050
Ouch.

22:45.284 --> 22:46.152
Oh!

22:48.054 --> 22:49.522
Loser!

22:49.589 --> 22:51.657
That's how we do it on
Earth, Earth, Earth, Earth.

22:51.724 --> 22:53.226
Awesome!

22:53.292 --> 22:56.128
What's that?
Looks like we've got a tied game.

22:56.195 --> 22:59.465
Uh-uh, you knows it.
Uh-uh, you know... Uh...

22:59.532 --> 23:00.399
Never mind.

23:02.235 --> 23:03.569
Loser!

23:03.636 --> 23:05.605
You know, I thought they were
the baby versions of us,

23:05.671 --> 23:08.873
but I think they're actually
the jerk versions of us?

23:14.746 --> 23:15.715
Loser!

23:15.780 --> 23:17.617
Way to put up a fight, Star.

23:17.683 --> 23:21.353
The important thing is participation
and the good sportsmanship.

23:23.255 --> 23:26.258
The important thing is we need
Raven to turn this around.

23:26.324 --> 23:29.628
Looks like our shorter Titans
are running short on contestants.

23:29.694 --> 23:32.998
I don't really feel like fighting you
guys, so I'm just gonna go.

23:33.064 --> 23:35.100
You can have this one.
Congrats.

23:36.401 --> 23:37.702
- What?
- Oops.

23:37.768 --> 23:40.405
Sorry, Raven, there's no room
for quitters in this game.

23:40.472 --> 23:43.841
Why not? Let her step out
of the ring, she forfeits.

23:43.907 --> 23:48.613
No, she can't do that, she has to fight,
or at least eliminate two more of you.

23:48.680 --> 23:49.947
Why?

23:50.014 --> 23:53.417
Because of an explanation,
which I, I have.

23:53.484 --> 23:55.219
This is weird, right?

23:55.286 --> 23:57.321
He didn't seem to care what
happened until it involved her.

23:58.322 --> 23:59.123
Let me out.

23:59.189 --> 24:02.192
- No.
- Let... me... out!

24:03.327 --> 24:04.261
Sorry.

24:04.328 --> 24:06.330
Her gem.

24:06.397 --> 24:09.132
Raven, calm down before
you lose control of yourself.

24:09.199 --> 24:11.067
Don't tell me what to do.

24:15.439 --> 24:16.373
That can't be good.

24:16.440 --> 24:17.307
Yes!

24:33.822 --> 24:35.658
Loser!

24:35.725 --> 24:36.626
Ugh!

24:49.271 --> 24:50.038
Loser!

24:50.105 --> 24:52.140
Yes! We can still win this!

24:52.207 --> 24:56.011
Have fun being losers, losers!

24:56.078 --> 24:57.279
Really, dude?

25:10.092 --> 25:12.661
Cyborg, we have to get
to the Master of Games.

25:12.728 --> 25:15.497
Find a frequency for these crystal
cages that will shatter them.

25:15.564 --> 25:16.431
Copy.

25:34.548 --> 25:35.416
That's it!

25:40.688 --> 25:42.390
Almost there.

25:44.023 --> 25:46.460
Azarath Metrion Zinthos!

25:56.570 --> 25:58.438
Aw, shucks, close enough.

25:58.505 --> 26:00.573
- How did you...
- I'll explain later.

26:00.640 --> 26:02.777
But right now
we have bigger problems.

26:02.843 --> 26:04.811
I think I know
who's behind this.

26:04.879 --> 26:05.945
Who?

26:08.947 --> 26:10.817
Ha-ha! What a stunning
turn of events.

26:10.884 --> 26:12.085
What are those?

26:12.152 --> 26:13.887
They've turned Ray!
Both of them!

26:13.952 --> 26:16.121
Ugh! Raven,
I'm coming to save you!

26:16.188 --> 26:17.624
Eventually...

26:17.690 --> 26:18.991
Cyborg, now!

26:22.261 --> 26:25.865
Whoa, Cyborg, any idea how...
the other you broke the crystals?

26:25.931 --> 26:30.602
I think he <i>vestake whooshe plinthor
shlebdak roothas minnerlip brusselop.</i>

26:31.771 --> 26:33.038
Those all sound like words.

26:33.105 --> 26:34.273
Let's give it a shot.

26:37.976 --> 26:39.645
Titans, take him down!

26:43.282 --> 26:44.149
Ow!

26:45.350 --> 26:47.386
All right,
what's really going on here?

26:47.453 --> 26:49.321
And how do we
cause it to cease?

26:49.388 --> 26:51.323
Ah, well, that was fun
while it lasted.

27:01.132 --> 27:02.467
Hi, there.

27:02.533 --> 27:03.668
Trigon?

27:03.735 --> 27:05.169
That's right.

27:05.236 --> 27:07.638
You mortals fell for
the oldest trick there is.

27:07.705 --> 27:10.174
A rigged sporting event.

27:14.579 --> 27:18.349
Wow, they wasn't even real
and they rooted against us.

27:18.416 --> 27:21.251
Goofy Titans, is that
the Trigon of your Earth?

27:21.319 --> 27:23.119
Yeah, he's a real pain.

27:23.186 --> 27:26.022
This one time, he gave me a puppy
for a hand, which seems awesome,

27:26.089 --> 27:26.958
but was actually...

27:27.023 --> 27:29.059
Then could that be...

27:50.847 --> 27:52.349
The other Trigon?

27:52.415 --> 27:55.251
But Raven defeated him,
he was destroyed.

27:55.317 --> 27:56.887
Yeah, well, I brought him back.

27:56.953 --> 27:57.921
Mostly.

27:57.988 --> 27:59.455
What's up with the one leg?

28:00.155 --> 28:01.725
Tripod.

28:03.392 --> 28:05.127
- 'Cause he's got three legs.
- Yeah. That's a good one.

28:05.194 --> 28:07.196
What is the meaning of this?

28:07.263 --> 28:11.001
By siphoning my daughter's demon power,
I've restored big Trigon here to existence.

28:11.066 --> 28:13.502
Eh, almost...

28:13.569 --> 28:15.638
Once her demon
is fully drained,

28:15.704 --> 28:18.507
big Triggy here
will regain all his power.

28:20.309 --> 28:23.211
And then, using this Worlogog,
we will conquer the Multiverse together.

28:23.279 --> 28:25.548
And there's nothing
you can do to stop us!

28:32.855 --> 28:35.356
Oh, and, uh, bye!

28:41.195 --> 28:42.764
Raven!

28:42.830 --> 28:44.967
We'll save Raven
after we get off this thing.

28:45.034 --> 28:46.801
Cyborg, save
the baby versions of us.

29:08.322 --> 29:10.090
Uh, why are they...

29:11.358 --> 29:13.260
Uh, whatever.

29:14.261 --> 29:15.829
Ooh, that's right.

29:15.896 --> 29:18.632
- I can fly! Ooh, yes.
- I got these.

29:20.367 --> 29:22.235
Everyone okay?

29:24.271 --> 29:26.006
Everyone who counts, I mean.

29:26.073 --> 29:28.475
What's that supposed to mean?

29:28.542 --> 29:30.978
I mean,
this is your team's fault.

29:31.044 --> 29:32.546
Why didn't you try
to work with us?

29:32.613 --> 29:34.447
It's like all you cared
about was winning.

29:34.513 --> 29:36.248
Of course that's what we cared about.

29:36.315 --> 29:38.284
That's why we
joined the tournament.

29:38.351 --> 29:41.220
Really? We joined because he told us if
we didn't he'd destroy our whole planet.

29:41.287 --> 29:44.690
We were just buying time till
we could make a plan, obviously.

29:44.757 --> 29:47.560
Ooh, that's a better
reason than ours.

29:47.627 --> 29:50.563
It does not matter whose reason
was more <i>grebbler necky.</i>

29:50.630 --> 29:53.866
Yes, our friends Raven
are in the danger.

29:53.933 --> 29:57.436
It is time for the cooperation.

30:00.640 --> 30:02.775
We don't need their help.

30:02.842 --> 30:05.044
- Right, guys?
- Don't see how they could.

30:05.111 --> 30:06.779
We can't trust 'em.

30:06.846 --> 30:09.214
Oh, you think you're so great
because you're tall and serious

30:09.280 --> 30:12.617
and a good leader and people listen to
you and you have normal sized hands...

30:12.684 --> 30:15.520
You are literally just listing
reasons I am so great.

30:17.188 --> 30:18.991
Well, we don't want your help.

30:19.058 --> 30:20.458
Right, my guys?

30:20.525 --> 30:23.795
- I don't know, we probably do.
- Yeah, why not?

30:23.862 --> 30:27.699
Can't you back up
your leader this one time?

30:27.766 --> 30:29.401
Leader?
That doesn't sound right.

30:29.467 --> 30:32.202
Yeah. I likes to thinks
of you as a cool uncle.

30:32.269 --> 30:33.905
- <i>Heh-heh-heh.</i>
- Who's not that cool.

30:33.972 --> 30:36.206
- <i>I've got a nickle.</i>
- We're practically the same age!

30:36.273 --> 30:37.341
We are?

30:42.312 --> 30:44.515
Wow, time's been real
rough on you, my man.

30:44.581 --> 30:46.918
You've got some
city miles on that face.

30:46.985 --> 30:48.552
Some team.

30:48.619 --> 30:49.954
Enough!

30:50.021 --> 30:52.756
Despite the differences,
our teams must work together.

30:52.823 --> 30:57.394
Perhaps our point will make more sense
through the singing of the songs.

31:06.136 --> 31:08.471
<i>♪ We are different From
each other No doubt about that ♪</i>

31:08.539 --> 31:10.273

32:42.997 --> 32:43.964
- Now!
- Agreed!

32:44.031 --> 32:45.431
Titans, go!

32:57.677 --> 33:01.548
Are you guys coming or...

33:01.614 --> 33:03.516
Where? What's the plan?

33:03.583 --> 33:06.019
Plan? We're going...

33:06.085 --> 33:07.353
Ugh.

33:07.420 --> 33:09.388
But going where?

33:09.455 --> 33:12.892
You just pointed in the random
direction and then ran out of the room.

33:12.959 --> 33:14.127
That's how we do.

33:14.194 --> 33:16.262
Which is probably how you
get into these messes.

33:16.328 --> 33:18.397
Look, the Trigons
took our friends

33:18.463 --> 33:20.365
using a multi-dimensional
Worlogog.

33:20.432 --> 33:23.903
But we don't know where they went
and have no way of following them.

33:23.970 --> 33:25.238
We need a plan.

33:25.305 --> 33:28.373
We'll come up with a plan
mid go, like always, right?

33:29.275 --> 33:31.244
- Oh, well...
- Um, sure, okay.

33:31.311 --> 33:35.647
You know, maybe we could, I don't
know, go in a different direction.

33:35.714 --> 33:39.318
Tall Robin is, um,
talking sense to me.

33:39.384 --> 33:40.586
We can't mess this up.

33:40.652 --> 33:42.454
It's the Raven mamas.

33:42.521 --> 33:46.158
Let us give the other Robin a
chance to come up with a plan.

33:46.225 --> 33:49.360
As smart and tall as he is.

33:51.830 --> 33:53.265
Don't worry.

33:53.332 --> 33:56.567
I'll figure out a way to find
the Ravens and get them back.

33:56.634 --> 33:58.736
- Yeah, all right.
- He's so handsome.

34:16.187 --> 34:17.420
Hello, sweetie.

34:17.487 --> 34:18.356
Ah!

34:18.420 --> 34:19.290
Wakey, wakey.

34:19.357 --> 34:20.958
Oh, man.

34:21.025 --> 34:22.525
- So this is still happening, huh?
- Looks like it.

34:22.592 --> 34:24.761
I really thought I'd
defeated my Trigon.

34:24.829 --> 34:26.663
You did.

34:26.730 --> 34:29.466
And because I was destroyed
by the power of a Raven,

34:29.532 --> 34:31.768
only a Raven's power
can bring me back.

34:31.835 --> 34:34.670
And once a gem cracked,
it became the perfect opportunity.

34:34.737 --> 34:36.406
How could you do this to me?

34:36.473 --> 34:38.708
I've been trying to take over
the universe with you for ages,

34:38.775 --> 34:41.610
but you had to be a hero
and hang out with your friends.

34:41.678 --> 34:45.982
So now, I am taking over
the Multiverse without you.

34:46.049 --> 34:47.350
Why drag her in?

34:47.416 --> 34:49.386
I need her.

34:49.485 --> 34:50.518
For what?

34:50.585 --> 34:53.554
I will finally destroy you.

34:55.724 --> 35:02.265
And together we'll show the Multiverse
that Trigon is not to be trifled with.

35:02.332 --> 35:05.302
I alone am already feared.

35:05.368 --> 35:07.370
Speak for yourself, little me.

35:07.436 --> 35:10.739
No, I-I just meant, between the
two of us we would be even more...

35:10.806 --> 35:12.007
Silence!

35:12.074 --> 35:15.611
I am still weak
and your prattle irritates me.

35:15.678 --> 35:18.113
Now, release to me your power,
small demon child.

35:18.180 --> 35:20.382
No, thanks.

35:20.448 --> 35:23.352
Come on, sweetie, so he can be fully returned
to existence. You don't mind? Hmm, do you?

35:23.419 --> 35:24.286
Still a no.

35:24.353 --> 35:25.254
Enough of this!

35:25.321 --> 35:27.056
Give me your demon!

35:27.122 --> 35:27.990
You hear me?

35:30.159 --> 35:32.394
Don't give into him,
Raven, stay strong.

35:32.460 --> 35:34.495
I've dealt with worse.

35:35.630 --> 35:37.532
Yo, Cy, check it out.

35:39.335 --> 35:41.069
- What are they doing?
- Ask 'em.

35:41.135 --> 35:42.304
What are you guys doing?

35:42.371 --> 35:43.304
Staying sharp.

35:43.372 --> 35:44.605
Waiting for Robbie's plan.

35:44.672 --> 35:47.208
Don't you guys ever just,
you know, kick it?

35:47.275 --> 35:50.044
Ooh, I am the best at kicking.

35:52.280 --> 35:54.481
Yeah, I meant, like, relax?

35:54.548 --> 35:56.250
- Chill.
- Have fun.

35:56.317 --> 35:58.953
You can't just go around having
fun while the Ravens are kidnapped

35:59.020 --> 36:01.456
and the Trigons are on the
loose with the Worlogog.

36:01.521 --> 36:03.291
See right there,
even that word...

36:03.358 --> 36:05.059
"Worlogog."

36:05.126 --> 36:08.495
It is the fun to say,
it makes your mouth feel the seasick.

36:08.562 --> 36:10.797
Worlogog.

36:10.864 --> 36:14.001
Worlogog.

36:14.067 --> 36:16.371
Wo-wo-wo-Worlogog.

36:16.437 --> 36:17.504
Try it.

36:17.971 --> 36:19.339
Worlogog?

36:19.406 --> 36:21.141
Man, don't just try it, like...

36:21.208 --> 36:24.177
Try it...

36:24.244 --> 36:25.212
Worlogog.

36:25.278 --> 36:26.346
Try it, try it.

36:26.413 --> 36:27.280
Worlogog.

36:27.347 --> 36:28.849
Don't fight it, fight it.

36:28.915 --> 36:29.916
Worlogog?

36:29.983 --> 36:30.649
Worlogog!

36:30.716 --> 36:32.252

To pad out. What?

37:09.455 --> 37:10.555
Screen time.

37:10.622 --> 37:11.756
You're welcome.

37:11.823 --> 37:13.858
Now, go get our couch.

37:13.925 --> 37:16.429
I was told this was
the escalator out of here.

37:22.901 --> 37:23.568
Hmm.

37:23.635 --> 37:25.003
Huh, very good.

37:25.070 --> 37:27.539
So, since I'm not gonna
use my powers,

37:27.604 --> 37:29.274
I guess we're stuck
here for a while.

37:29.340 --> 37:31.309
Time has no meaning to Trigon.

37:31.376 --> 37:35.346
- Right, but what if you have to scratch your nose?
- Or get thirsty?

37:35.413 --> 37:37.982
It's pretty hot down here,
I know I'm parched.

37:38.049 --> 37:41.219
I am Trigon the terrible,
the lord of madness.

37:41.286 --> 37:44.322
I do not get parched.

37:44.389 --> 37:45.823
If you say so.

37:59.436 --> 38:02.005
Other Trigon, to me.

38:02.072 --> 38:04.707
Number one, we've got to figure
out what to call each other.

38:04.774 --> 38:06.776
Number two,
you can't just order me around.

38:06.843 --> 38:10.713
I have become parched.
Procure me a soda.

38:10.780 --> 38:13.283
Wouldn't water
be more hydrating?

38:13.350 --> 38:14.717
Soda!

38:14.784 --> 38:17.153
Fine, but just this once.

38:18.322 --> 38:20.123
Larger!

38:20.890 --> 38:22.526
Place it to my lips.

38:22.593 --> 38:24.060
I'm not gonna do that.

38:24.127 --> 38:27.196
You must, it is the only way
we can conquer existence!

38:30.632 --> 38:31.868
Higher, higher.

38:31.934 --> 38:33.936
- No.
- Stop moving you mouth.

38:34.003 --> 38:36.172
I'm trying to move the straw, but you're
moving to where the straw used to be.

38:36.239 --> 38:38.074
Stop, now, stop.

38:38.141 --> 38:39.475
My-my eye!

38:41.977 --> 38:43.845
You're not listening.

38:43.912 --> 38:45.615
I'm trying to move the straw,
but you're moving to where the straw...

38:45.680 --> 38:46.882
Stop, now, le...

38:46.948 --> 38:49.017
Just give me that thing!

38:56.691 --> 38:58.527
Oh, yeah.

38:58.594 --> 39:00.729
Soda...

39:00.795 --> 39:02.964
Well, good.
I'm glad you're happy now!

39:04.032 --> 39:06.368
The Ravens have escaped,
haven't they?

39:06.434 --> 39:08.236
Yep. They tricked us.

39:08.303 --> 39:10.539
Pretty obvious, in hindsight.
Ha-ha, eh, big guy?

39:10.605 --> 39:12.541
Find them!

39:14.342 --> 39:16.944
Keep moving,
I think I see light up ahead.

39:22.484 --> 39:24.452
Where are we?

39:24.519 --> 39:25.386
We're home.

39:27.354 --> 39:31.091
This is my Earth.
Come on, we'll have to walk.

39:31.158 --> 39:35.396
Walk? Ugh, this is the worst thing that
has ever happened to anyone in history.

39:35.462 --> 39:37.798
Worse than spending
more time with our dads?

39:37.865 --> 39:40.434
You haven't found them yet?

39:40.501 --> 39:43.304
What was that?
I-I couldn't hear you the first time!

39:43.370 --> 39:47.208
Ugh... Walking it is.

39:47.274 --> 39:51.878
We're trapped on this alternate Earth and everyone
is counting on me to come up with a plan.

39:51.945 --> 39:53.846
<i>Me...</i>

39:53.913 --> 39:56.382
I've trained my whole life for this
moment and I can't let them down.

39:56.450 --> 39:59.085
- The Multiverse is at stake and...
- So, uh...

40:00.486 --> 40:02.255
What are ya doing?

40:02.322 --> 40:05.925
I'm... thinking.
Trying to come up with a plan.

40:05.992 --> 40:07.927
Ooh, I get it.

40:07.994 --> 40:11.064
Brooding heroically is how I think
of plans, too. Ha-ha, I'll join you.

40:11.130 --> 40:12.999
I really wish you wouldn't.

40:13.066 --> 40:17.170
Oh right. Got it. Uh, I'll just be
right over here. Ha. Don't mind me.

40:19.738 --> 40:23.509
This is the price of leadership.
The cost of being a hero...

40:23.576 --> 40:25.911
Leadership... Hero!

40:25.978 --> 40:27.380
Could you stop that?

40:28.013 --> 40:30.082
What? I'm helping.

40:31.750 --> 40:35.120
Ugh! Fine, I'll leave.

40:36.655 --> 40:39.057
How do you get your hair
to blow in the wind like that?

40:39.124 --> 40:40.158
Go away!

40:42.027 --> 40:44.862
Eh, I dunno about that guy.
I know he says he's coming up with a plan,

40:44.929 --> 40:48.333
but when it turns out he's a bust,
don't worry, I'll bail us out.

40:48.400 --> 40:50.269
I don't think
we're going to need that.

40:50.335 --> 40:52.337
Yeah, these serious
Titans are great.

40:52.404 --> 40:55.172
And we're really getting
in sync, yo! Watch this.

40:55.239 --> 40:57.342
Guess what I'm gonna
change into...

41:00.579 --> 41:01.812
Now!

41:01.879 --> 41:03.615
See? Ha-ha!

41:03.682 --> 41:06.617
And I have been getting the tips
for the feeding of the Silkie.

41:06.685 --> 41:10.421
Yes, you have all been feeding
your Silkie too much garbage.

41:22.266 --> 41:25.569
Me and my dude are going over the data
he got from that crystal doohickey.

41:25.636 --> 41:27.170
He's got some great programs.

41:27.237 --> 41:31.908
Yes. This cybernetic body
is a gift... And a curse.

41:31.975 --> 41:33.744
Hey, what did we say?

41:33.810 --> 41:37.247
There are no
downsides to a cool robot body.

41:37.314 --> 41:39.784
That's right,
that's a good cyborg.

41:39.849 --> 41:42.218
Oh, wow. Yay.
We are all besties now.

41:42.285 --> 41:44.354
Ha! Titans! I have a plan.

41:44.421 --> 41:46.855
- All right, let's hear it!
- Shh! Shh! Listen, listen!

41:46.923 --> 41:52.061
The Trigons used the Worlogog to transport us
to this Earth. But it came from our Earth.

41:52.128 --> 41:56.131
That's right, the wavelengths
match our frequency, not theirs.

41:56.198 --> 41:59.301
So, if everything on this Earth
is a copy of ours...

41:59.369 --> 42:01.937
Other way around, pal.

42:02.004 --> 42:03.906
Then there must be
a Worlogog here, too.

42:03.972 --> 42:07.076
We just have to find it,
and use it to get to the Ravens!

42:07.142 --> 42:09.345
Where would we even start?

42:09.411 --> 42:13.749
Considering that the fake Master of Games was
using it as a looking glass to find us all,

42:13.817 --> 42:15.351
we need to find
someone like him.

42:15.417 --> 42:19.655
So, we need a dude who can be
everywhere at once...

42:19.722 --> 42:24.526
And can see everything,
like when you're sleeping or-or awake...

42:24.593 --> 42:25.694
Oh!

42:25.761 --> 42:27.962
Of course!
It is the obvious!

42:28.029 --> 42:29.498
What is? What's the obvious?

42:29.565 --> 42:31.299
It's so simple!

42:31.367 --> 42:34.168
That's how's he goes to every
house on Earth in just one night!

42:34.235 --> 42:35.236
Who?

42:40.074 --> 42:42.176
Santa Claus.

42:45.380 --> 42:47.915
So they really weren't joking.

42:54.155 --> 42:58.559
Hurry. Before
there are more of the elves.

42:58.626 --> 43:01.995
Wait. On this Earth,
you regularly battle the real Santa Claus?

43:02.062 --> 43:05.232
Not all the time.
Just for holiday specials.

43:05.298 --> 43:06.868
Sometimes we team up
with Santa.

43:06.933 --> 43:10.404
But always there is the betrayal.
It is the complicated.

43:10.470 --> 43:11.338
Reindeer!

43:15.877 --> 43:17.077
All the better.

43:17.144 --> 43:18.578
Wha...

43:22.582 --> 43:26.353
Sleep.

43:30.357 --> 43:31.691
Ugh...

43:49.074 --> 43:54.013
Ho, ho, ho...
What took you so long?

43:54.079 --> 43:55.714
We are the spotted!

43:55.781 --> 44:01.019
I always knew you Titans would
come for the Worlogog one day,

44:01.085 --> 44:03.622
just a matter of time.

44:03.689 --> 44:07.392
Hand it over, Santa!
There doesn't need to be any trouble.

44:07.460 --> 44:10.228
Santa Claus.
He's right there.

44:10.295 --> 44:14.466
Every time you Titans travel to the
North Pole, you get the best of me.

44:14.532 --> 44:15.768
But not this time.

44:15.835 --> 44:18.904
You'll have to face my secret weapon.

44:18.970 --> 44:20.906
What is
this weapon of the secret?

44:20.972 --> 44:25.176
My wife. And you don't want
to get on her bad side.

44:25.243 --> 44:28.045
She's a real lump of coal,
she is.

44:42.392 --> 44:44.762
Mrs. Claus?

44:46.530 --> 44:51.903
"Mrs. Claus" was my mother's name.
Call me Megan.

44:53.670 --> 44:58.141
You can have the Worlogog when
you pry it from my cold hands.

44:58.208 --> 45:01.645
They're cold because of
the North Pole! Get it?

45:01.712 --> 45:03.714
That's not even funny!

45:22.398 --> 45:25.434
Yes, hi. Have seen two
sullen looking teens?

45:26.869 --> 45:28.838
About this tall and this tall?

45:31.107 --> 45:35.076
Ugh, okay.
Thanks for nothing.

45:35.143 --> 45:37.647
He's gone.
Let's keep moving.

45:37.713 --> 45:41.249
I'm not sure I've ever done
this much walking. Not a fan.

45:41.316 --> 45:45.021
It's not so bad...

45:45.086 --> 45:48.557
I... like it... even.

45:48.623 --> 45:53.061
I think... walking is... fun.

45:53.128 --> 45:56.398
Once we get back to my tower, we can
figure out how to contact the Titans

45:56.464 --> 45:57.967
and fix the crack in your gem.

45:58.034 --> 46:00.435
That way they can't siphon
your demon powers away.

46:00.502 --> 46:02.604
Or maybe I should
just let them?

46:02.671 --> 46:06.641
What? You don't mean that.
Our powers are part of who we are.

46:06.708 --> 46:10.545
I know, I just... I wouldn't mind
being rid of my demon side either.

46:10.612 --> 46:13.448
Just once I'd love
to feel... normal.

46:13.515 --> 46:16.685
But your demon side is still you.
It can be used for good.

46:16.751 --> 46:19.988
You just have to embrace it
instead of trying to lock it away.

46:20.055 --> 46:23.624
What if it takes over?
What if it hurts my friends...

46:23.691 --> 46:28.095
I've learned to calm my powers by focusing
on the things that tether me to my humanity.

46:28.162 --> 46:30.531
- What are they?
- <i>My</i> friends.

46:30.598 --> 46:33.167
Come on, we are almost there.

46:33.867 --> 46:35.502
Ugh!

46:35.569 --> 46:38.204
So, if you could fly again,
but you'd become an evil demon,

46:38.272 --> 46:39.673
you'd really choose walking?

46:39.740 --> 46:41.642
Don't make me
second guess this.

46:58.993 --> 47:00.660
Naughty!

47:02.062 --> 47:04.397
You're not nice!

47:09.869 --> 47:10.737
Aah!

47:20.145 --> 47:21.213
Mmm!

47:28.387 --> 47:31.790
Ugh! It's official.
I hate this goofy Earth!

47:31.857 --> 47:34.159
We just have to get
the Worlogog away from her!

47:34.226 --> 47:35.427
Hoo-ya!

47:36.528 --> 47:38.897
Titans, attack pattern
alpha four!

47:38.964 --> 47:40.098
Copy that.

47:50.207 --> 47:54.079
Ooh! Look at 'em! They're doing that thing
where they're good at being superheroes!

47:54.146 --> 47:55.881
Oh! Oh!
I love when they do that!

47:55.947 --> 47:57.715
I love
when they do that.

48:04.321 --> 48:06.190
No!

48:09.360 --> 48:12.496
My Worlogog!

48:12.563 --> 48:16.934
I got it!

48:18.268 --> 48:20.571
That's right!
Let's do this thing.

48:25.943 --> 48:27.310
Whoops, that didn't work.

48:30.147 --> 48:32.449
Now that's more like it!

48:32.515 --> 48:34.818
Everybody hop on!
We're outta here!

48:34.884 --> 48:38.655
Cyborg cycle, activate
alpha maneuver 42-delta!

48:40.457 --> 48:42.225
That means let's make a portal.

48:42.292 --> 48:44.094
You have to agree on codes
ahead of time!

48:44.160 --> 48:46.996
Did you think we were just yelling
random gibberish in battle?

48:48.031 --> 48:49.666
I guess I did think that, yes.

48:50.867 --> 48:53.368
Don't just stand there,
get the sleigh!

48:53.435 --> 48:54.738
I don't know how
to create a portal!

48:54.804 --> 48:56.505
I've never used
a Worlogog before.

48:56.572 --> 48:58.007
Just zap it or something!

49:02.112 --> 49:03.880
Cool!

49:05.215 --> 49:08.317
That's my Worlogog!
Gimme. Gimme!

49:08.383 --> 49:09.918
Go! Go! Go!

49:14.123 --> 49:15.491
Whoa!

49:15.557 --> 49:16.658
Where are we?

49:16.725 --> 49:18.660
We must be between Earths.

49:18.727 --> 49:21.530
Some sort of wormhole that connects
to each of them through these portals.

49:21.597 --> 49:23.899
Well, which portal
leads to yours?

49:23.966 --> 49:26.434
I don't know,
but we better find out quick.

49:33.307 --> 49:34.742
We have to find our Earth!

49:34.809 --> 49:36.611
We gotta lose the Santas first!

49:51.125 --> 49:53.027
Whoa, did we make it?

49:53.094 --> 49:56.864
This looks like their Earth I bet.
Ya know, 'cause it's all drab.

49:56.931 --> 49:59.533
No... This is closer,
but I don't think we're...

49:59.599 --> 50:00.667
Who are you!

50:04.105 --> 50:05.739
What are you?

50:05.806 --> 50:08.575
Whoa!

50:08.642 --> 50:10.777
Aw, man, look at that guy!

50:14.815 --> 50:16.783
I see him.

50:16.850 --> 50:20.654
See, I thought you were the cool serious
one, but that dude is the cool serious one.

50:20.720 --> 50:22.321
Uh-huh.

50:22.389 --> 50:24.524
Like, compared to him,
you're a silly little joke-man, like me!

50:24.591 --> 50:28.427
Except worse! Because you try to
be serious. You just failin' at it!

50:28.494 --> 50:31.965
So it's agreed, these be
the real serious Titans.

50:32.032 --> 50:35.634
And they have an even
more handsome Robin!

50:38.604 --> 50:40.573
- Let's get out of here!
- Yes, we have to save Raven!

50:40.639 --> 50:43.542
Naughty!
Naughty! Naughty!

50:43.609 --> 50:45.711
Aw, man,
I thought we ditched them!

50:50.850 --> 50:54.453
Huh. Was that... Santa Claus?

51:02.061 --> 51:04.163
They took out the treehouse!

51:04.230 --> 51:07.099
Hey, look! Actual baby Titans!
With little baby hands and everything.

51:07.166 --> 51:10.535
See! Those are the little,
pants-wetting baby Titans, not us.

51:19.611 --> 51:21.280
Don't we have any way
of shooting back?

51:21.347 --> 51:22.747
I'm glad you asked.

51:24.115 --> 51:24.983
Awesome.

51:29.519 --> 51:31.823
I want to shoot the giant gun.

51:33.825 --> 51:39.297
<i>Meanwhile, over the depths of the
Atlantic the titans face... Oh, my stars!</i>

51:39.364 --> 51:40.430
Golly gee!

51:45.435 --> 51:46.703
That's what's up!

51:59.816 --> 52:04.021
I knew it! I knew it!
Goggles on top hats! Ha-ha!

52:11.929 --> 52:14.097
Aw, we just can't
lose these fools!

52:14.164 --> 52:15.731
I've got an idea.

52:18.201 --> 52:20.136
Everybody, hold on!

52:20.203 --> 52:23.407
This thing's got one thing that
old sleigh of theirs doesn't.

52:23.472 --> 52:24.540
Brakes.

52:26.909 --> 52:27.777
Huh?

52:35.818 --> 52:37.552
Oy...

52:37.619 --> 52:40.222
Well, that just roasts
my chestnuts.

52:40.289 --> 52:41.723
Where the holly are we?

52:41.790 --> 52:44.926
I think we're back
on Earth, heh-heh.

52:44.994 --> 52:47.163
But... Oh, no!

52:47.229 --> 52:49.165
- Santa!
- Presents!

52:50.465 --> 52:52.534
A mall in December!

52:54.337 --> 52:57.472
No! No! Get off Me! Ah! No!

53:00.742 --> 53:02.544
Okay, now we lost 'em.

53:02.610 --> 53:05.546
And we have a lock on our Earth.
We can take us to the Ravens.

53:05.613 --> 53:09.583
Hold up! When we gets there,
how's we gonna fight two Trigons?

53:09.650 --> 53:11.585
We'll need a plan
for when we arrive.

53:11.652 --> 53:14.089
I just have to think
for a second.

53:14.155 --> 53:16.057
Trapped between worlds,

53:16.124 --> 53:17.491
the whole team, no,

53:17.558 --> 53:19.760
the whole Multiverse
is counting on me.

53:19.827 --> 53:21.996
I've come a long way from
my days at the circus,

53:22.062 --> 53:25.666
but I have to think of a way to get the
Raven's back to safety.

53:25.733 --> 53:28.235
Wow, seriously,
does he do this every time?

53:28.302 --> 53:32.006
Quiet, quiet, everyone listen
to the handsome Robin.

53:32.072 --> 53:34.441
- Titans! I've got a plan!
- All right!

53:34.507 --> 53:35.642
Robin's plans are the best!

53:35.709 --> 53:37.577
Aw, man,
he makes good plans.

53:37.644 --> 53:39.579
Yay. No, no, it's great.
It is, really.

53:39.645 --> 53:41.015
So we're setting
a course for home?

53:41.081 --> 53:44.550
Not yet, we've got
a few stops to make first.

53:49.622 --> 53:53.260
That wasn't so bad.

53:55.496 --> 53:57.663
See? I can manage
without powers.

53:57.730 --> 53:59.532
Come on, let's take
that ferry to the tower.

53:59.599 --> 54:00.767
Then I'll figure out a way...

54:02.668 --> 54:04.170
Aw, nuts.

54:04.237 --> 54:05.304
Surprised?

54:07.106 --> 54:11.878
Only an imbecile wouldn't realize
that this is where you were headed.

54:13.513 --> 54:14.546
You rang?

54:14.613 --> 54:16.282
Leave her alone.
Both of you!

54:16.349 --> 54:19.085
Give us what we want
and no one will get hurt.

54:23.555 --> 54:25.525
Let her go.

54:25.590 --> 54:27.092
No can do!

54:27.159 --> 54:29.161
If you care for my daughter
then you have a choice.

54:29.227 --> 54:34.399
Give me the rest of your demon
or the other me will destroy her.

54:43.408 --> 54:45.110
Too easy.

54:46.644 --> 54:48.413
Yes.

54:48.480 --> 54:49.347
No.

54:49.414 --> 54:51.682
He shoots, he scores!

54:57.556 --> 54:59.824
Raven.

55:08.232 --> 55:09.100
Hmm?

55:09.166 --> 55:10.034
Huh?

55:10.101 --> 55:11.969
Ugh, what?

55:12.036 --> 55:14.604
What up, big T?
Check out this fist I made.

55:16.373 --> 55:17.740
Whoo! We made it.

55:17.807 --> 55:19.176
Get the other Trigon!

55:20.677 --> 55:22.279
Raven, what's the situation?

55:22.346 --> 55:24.814
She's alive, but all her powers
have been drained.

55:24.881 --> 55:27.418
More on that later,
you okay, Mama?

55:27.485 --> 55:29.386
- Ugh...
- Mama Ray-Ray...

55:29.453 --> 55:32.956
I feel... I feel...

55:33.022 --> 55:36.392
I feel great! And you've
never looked so handsome.

55:38.628 --> 55:41.764
What?

55:41.831 --> 55:44.767
Guys, something's really
wrong with Raven.

55:44.834 --> 55:46.668
Actually,
I've never felt better!

55:46.735 --> 55:50.772
With her demon side removed,
this is what she's like. She's... happy.

55:54.776 --> 55:57.679
You fool!

56:00.250 --> 56:03.986
You didn't think they'd find
the Worlogog from <i>your</i> Earth?

56:04.052 --> 56:07.156
- It wasn't easy!
- That Mrs. Claus is legit!

56:07.222 --> 56:09.892
Yeah, I just figured
Santa's wife had it covered.

56:09.958 --> 56:14.329
First you resurrect me minus a leg,
then you let the Ravens get away,

56:14.396 --> 56:16.965
and now you've allowed the
Titans to return to this Earth!

56:17.032 --> 56:20.235
It's not like we can't
defeat them, there's two of us.

56:20.302 --> 56:23.738
How could you be so careless?
So unfathomably stupid?

56:23.804 --> 56:27.309
Oh, I know, it's because everything
from your world is just a pea brained,

56:27.376 --> 56:30.912
squashed down,
bobbleheaded version of ours!

56:30.978 --> 56:33.214
- Oh, no, he didn't.
- Oh, that's wrong.

56:33.282 --> 56:36.250
I've had about
enough of you.

56:39.754 --> 56:42.356
- Whoa!
- That's crazy.

56:43.758 --> 56:47.094
Is no one on my side?

56:47.161 --> 56:50.531
I've tried to take over the
universe with my daughter...

56:50.598 --> 56:53.034
But no.

56:53.100 --> 56:55.503
What's happening?
Why are people growing limbs and stuff?

56:55.570 --> 56:57.505
Her dad consumed
my dad's power.

56:57.572 --> 56:59.039
He's leveling up.

56:59.106 --> 57:02.276
I tried to take over
the Multiverse with myself...

57:02.343 --> 57:05.946
But no!

57:07.448 --> 57:11.084
This is the unfortunate
bending of events.

57:11.151 --> 57:13.887
If you want something
done right...

57:14.754 --> 57:17.692
you have to do it yourself.

57:17.757 --> 57:20.527
I am Trigon no longer.

57:20.594 --> 57:25.065
The Multiverse will tremble
at the name of...

57:25.731 --> 57:27.967
Hexagon!

57:30.869 --> 57:33.739
Wait, like the shape?

57:33.806 --> 57:38.110
No, not like the shape.
Like me, Hexagon!

57:40.279 --> 57:44.651
Because I have twice
the power I once possessed.

57:44.718 --> 57:46.485
Yeah, and twice the butts.

57:48.420 --> 57:51.557
Yo,
this dude's got two butts!

57:51.624 --> 57:56.262
Of course I do!
I have doubled my entire being so...

57:56.328 --> 57:58.796
So, you intentionally gave
yourself the two butts?

57:58.863 --> 58:02.934
No, I mean, yes... It was
intentional in the sense that I knew

58:03.001 --> 58:08.407
it would happen, but it's not like
the two butts was the selling point!

58:08.474 --> 58:13.445
It feels like you're really attached to the
two butts, guy. That's fine, just go with it.

58:13.512 --> 58:15.880
Silence!

58:20.051 --> 58:22.287
Too many butt jokes.

58:22.353 --> 58:25.757
I am Hexagon,
destroyer of universes!

58:25.823 --> 58:30.662
With the Worlogog, I can travel the
Multiverse and bend it to my will

58:30.728 --> 58:36.967
and there is nothing you little
"heroes" can do to stop me!

58:37.034 --> 58:39.671
That would
probably be true,

58:39.737 --> 58:41.339
except for one thing...

58:42.640 --> 58:44.374
We didn't come alone.

58:57.287 --> 59:01.158
- Hi-ho, hello.
- How are you? Here for the fight.

59:01.224 --> 59:03.093
- Kah.
- Tweet, tweet!

59:03.160 --> 59:06.095
It's them!
The Protein Titans!

59:06.163 --> 59:08.265
I'm just so happy!

59:12.469 --> 59:16.005
Say hello to the Teen Titans
of Infinite Earths.

59:17.840 --> 59:19.208
Bleh.

59:19.275 --> 59:21.010
You can maybe defeat
two teams of Titans...

59:21.077 --> 59:22.311
I definitely could.

59:22.378 --> 59:24.847
But now
you're up against all of us!

59:24.914 --> 59:27.883
- Titans of Infinite Earths...
- Go!

59:32.221 --> 59:34.256
Aim for the face!

59:41.330 --> 59:43.131
Ooh, ooh, ooh,
let's all be piranha!

59:43.198 --> 59:46.502
I always wanna do piranha,
but one piranha is pretty pointless.

59:46.569 --> 59:48.370
Don'ts I know it.

59:51.940 --> 59:53.174
One of my utters!

59:53.241 --> 59:55.845
Tamaranian battle
formation <i>Gleebrex!</i>

59:55.910 --> 59:57.278
<i>Reckzar!</i>

01:00:04.152 --> 01:00:08.256
Ready... aim... booyah!

01:00:16.930 --> 01:00:19.199
Ow! That hurts a little.

01:00:20.568 --> 01:00:23.705
- My eight pack!
- Azarath Metrion Zinthos!

01:00:23.772 --> 01:00:26.808
- Stop!
- Keep it up, crew!

01:00:30.411 --> 01:00:33.947
It is working!
We have the above hand!

01:00:34.014 --> 01:00:36.683
Enough of this foolishness!

01:01:04.277 --> 01:01:10.048
- But... my plan.
- Guess you didn't see that one coming, did ya, Boy Wonder.

01:01:22.961 --> 01:01:25.497
You know, I never noticed
how colorful everything is.

01:01:26.866 --> 01:01:30.837
Like this rock streaking
towards me. It's beautiful...

01:01:30.903 --> 01:01:33.940
Raven, you have to snap out of this!
We need you!

01:01:34.005 --> 01:01:36.475
Uh, can't you get
your powers back somehow?

01:01:36.541 --> 01:01:39.611
Yes, that's it! Raven's demon
got loose when her gem cracked,

01:01:39.678 --> 01:01:43.215
<i>all we have to do to get it
back is break Hexagon's gem.</i>

01:01:43.281 --> 01:01:49.921
<i>Then my Trigon will fade out of existence and
your Trigon will be... well, your Trigon.</i>

01:01:49.987 --> 01:01:51.121
Meh.

01:01:51.188 --> 01:01:52.724
He's not so bad. Huh?

01:02:03.100 --> 01:02:05.069
Raven, we have to
get your demon back.

01:02:05.135 --> 01:02:09.039
Ooh... I'm
feeling pretty great without it.

01:02:09.106 --> 01:02:12.176
But thanks.
I super appreciate the offer.

01:02:12.243 --> 01:02:14.278
Look around you.

01:02:14.345 --> 01:02:17.548
Remember how worried you were that your
demon powers might hurt your friends?

01:02:18.349 --> 01:02:19.683
Well, there you go.

01:02:32.529 --> 01:02:36.766
Why?
He was a turtle.

01:02:36.833 --> 01:02:39.435
You're right,
but what do you want me to do?

01:02:40.670 --> 01:02:42.171
You have to eat me.

01:02:43.406 --> 01:02:44.574
What?

01:02:44.641 --> 01:02:47.410
You have to absorb my powers.
By eating me.

01:02:47.477 --> 01:02:49.445
Shoots, you could
eat all of them.

01:02:49.512 --> 01:02:52.415
That many Ravens you'd
be like... a Mega Raven!

01:02:54.517 --> 01:02:56.151
You'd have the power
of an entire flock.

01:02:56.218 --> 01:02:57.587
He's right.

01:02:57.654 --> 01:03:00.023
But, I don't want to...
Why can't you eat me?

01:03:00.088 --> 01:03:01.858
Because...

01:03:01.925 --> 01:03:04.593
My mouth won't
animate that big.

01:03:05.895 --> 01:03:08.263
Okay. Here goes nothing.

01:03:18.407 --> 01:03:20.042
Yes!

01:03:24.479 --> 01:03:25.346
Gross.

01:03:28.817 --> 01:03:30.551
You two again?

01:03:38.026 --> 01:03:39.962
Is it working?

01:03:40.028 --> 01:03:42.096
I don't know,
but I taste surprisingly delicious.

01:03:42.163 --> 01:03:43.631
Argh!

01:03:46.867 --> 01:03:48.836
I think that's a yes.

01:03:53.874 --> 01:03:55.141
Huh?

01:03:55.208 --> 01:03:57.912
At last...

01:04:00.313 --> 01:04:02.349
This looks like the end.

01:04:10.724 --> 01:04:11.725
Huh?

01:04:15.829 --> 01:04:17.397
Impossible.

01:04:26.171 --> 01:04:28.207
It's Raven. I think.

01:04:28.273 --> 01:04:29.241
Weird.

01:04:29.308 --> 01:04:32.511
What are you supposed to be?

01:04:32.579 --> 01:04:35.949
What, you don't know a flock of
Ravens when you see one?

01:04:36.016 --> 01:04:38.651
We are... the Unkindness.

01:04:41.286 --> 01:04:42.488
Ha-ha, sick!

01:04:42.554 --> 01:04:45.591
Do it, Raven! Finish him off!

01:04:51.563 --> 01:04:55.199
Daughter, you cannot defy me!

01:04:55.267 --> 01:04:58.704
Oh, yeah?
Then I guess I can't do this!

01:05:13.018 --> 01:05:14.385
Oh, come on!

01:05:49.286 --> 01:05:51.155
You will not defeat me!

01:05:51.221 --> 01:05:56.259
I am Hexagon! I will not be
foiled by the likes of you.

01:06:01.164 --> 01:06:03.800
Yes...

01:06:05.068 --> 01:06:06.870
We've got to do something!

01:06:06.937 --> 01:06:08.705
We have need of the plan!

01:06:10.539 --> 01:06:13.542
Another plan?
We're already three plans deep.

01:06:13.609 --> 01:06:18.280
There's no time to plan. We just gotta...
"go." Give me the Worlogog.

01:06:18.347 --> 01:06:20.249
Time to save the day.

01:06:22.818 --> 01:06:23.886
What?

01:06:23.953 --> 01:06:25.621
Well, everyone was
eating things, so...

01:06:25.688 --> 01:06:28.157
They're all demons, it don't
work like that for us.

01:06:30.059 --> 01:06:33.729
Wait, I have another idea.
Get me to his Worlogog!

01:06:33.796 --> 01:06:34.930
With pleasure.

01:06:35.363 --> 01:06:36.431
Pull!

01:06:43.571 --> 01:06:44.807
Hmm?

01:06:45.241 --> 01:06:46.108
Argh!

01:06:46.175 --> 01:06:47.575
Boom!

01:06:47.642 --> 01:06:48.309
Oomph!

01:06:57.318 --> 01:06:59.554
Ugh... No, get back in there.

01:06:59.621 --> 01:07:01.022
Oh, no, you don't!

01:07:07.729 --> 01:07:11.365
Come on, Titans!
Raven needs help with the tug of the war!

01:07:11.431 --> 01:07:13.667
You cannot defeat me,
daughter.

01:07:13.735 --> 01:07:18.338
I am immortal.
I am forever, I...

01:07:18.405 --> 01:07:20.141
Am the out numbered.

01:07:25.679 --> 01:07:29.316
No! It's mine!
You never wanted it anyway!

01:07:29.383 --> 01:07:30.584
Well, I was wrong.

01:07:30.651 --> 01:07:32.419
I'm half human, aren't I?

01:07:38.659 --> 01:07:41.360
- No!
- Argh!

01:07:51.804 --> 01:07:54.308
Hmm? Where am I?

01:07:56.008 --> 01:07:57.777
Ah! Uh... Hmm?

01:08:00.280 --> 01:08:02.582
No, no, no!

01:08:12.758 --> 01:08:14.694
R-Raven?

01:08:16.560 --> 01:08:18.662
You still in there, Mama?

01:08:25.604 --> 01:08:28.939
Oh, you're back.

01:08:29.006 --> 01:08:32.109
Yeah, I know.
You think I don't like you.

01:08:32.176 --> 01:08:35.981
But maybe... Maybe it's because
I never got to know you.

01:08:36.948 --> 01:08:38.884
I'm not the best people person,

01:08:38.950 --> 01:08:40.952
or demon person,
for that matter.

01:08:41.019 --> 01:08:45.055
But I promise,
no more gems, no more safes.

01:08:45.122 --> 01:08:50.394
Whatever we do going forward,
we do it together.

01:09:00.205 --> 01:09:02.173
What are you all staring at?

01:09:02.240 --> 01:09:04.008
It's just me.

01:09:04.073 --> 01:09:05.609
- Joy! We are the saved!
- Raven! Raven! Raven!

01:09:05.676 --> 01:09:07.144
Nice job, Raven!

01:09:07.211 --> 01:09:09.513
All right, all right.
I'm still a demon, you know.

01:09:12.116 --> 01:09:15.185
Titans of Infinite Earths,
time to hit the road!

01:09:19.390 --> 01:09:24.861
Goodbye, Protein Titans!
You were as beautiful as I hoped you'd be!

01:09:24.929 --> 01:09:27.197
Good job saving
the Multiverse, everyone.

01:09:27.264 --> 01:09:32.969
Me and my very serious Teen Titans have
to go back to our very serious world.

01:09:33.036 --> 01:09:37.073
And have, I assume,
very serious PG-13 adventures.

01:09:37.140 --> 01:09:40.377
Robin, you are not
the Nightwing.

01:09:40.443 --> 01:09:42.745
He is the much better looking.

01:09:46.149 --> 01:09:49.018
It's just you guys now,
time to go home.

01:09:49.819 --> 01:09:51.955
It's been... weird.

01:09:52.020 --> 01:09:54.357
But you've got a lot of cool
stuff packed in that robot body.

01:09:54.424 --> 01:09:57.994
Thanks! I also have a waffle maker in
here somewhere, but it never came up.

01:09:59.962 --> 01:10:01.496
I just wanted
you to know that.

01:10:01.563 --> 01:10:04.099
Goodbye, sister
from the other Earth.

01:10:04.167 --> 01:10:05.934
Oh, I will miss the you.

01:10:06.001 --> 01:10:09.671
It is hard being the only
Tamaranian on a team of all humans.

01:10:09.738 --> 01:10:13.608
And whatever Robin is.
I believe, a wombat.

01:10:13.675 --> 01:10:14.543
Hey!

01:10:21.883 --> 01:10:23.785
Laters, good-looking!

01:10:28.023 --> 01:10:31.959
When I first met you,
I thought you were weird and annoying.

01:10:34.729 --> 01:10:36.931
- And?
- And you are.

01:10:38.632 --> 01:10:40.302
But...

01:10:40.369 --> 01:10:44.238
But you're also a good
superhero, in your own weird way.

01:10:44.305 --> 01:10:47.808
But with several more years training and,
assuming you reach a normal height...

01:10:47.875 --> 01:10:49.610
Let's be done
shaking hands now.

01:10:49.677 --> 01:10:52.179
I'm not really
a goodbye person.

01:10:52.246 --> 01:10:54.181
Same.

01:10:54.248 --> 01:10:55.983
If your dad ever comes back and you
need someone to help beat him up...

01:10:56.050 --> 01:10:58.518
I know who to call.
See ya around.

01:10:58.585 --> 01:11:01.588
Titans, go!
Back to our Earth!

01:11:06.626 --> 01:11:08.528
Hey, shouldn't we be
taking that with us?

01:11:08.595 --> 01:11:10.264
- Nope!
- It came from our Earth.

01:11:10.331 --> 01:11:12.400
- Not important.
- What if we ever need to come back?

01:11:12.466 --> 01:11:14.034
You won't.

01:11:14.100 --> 01:11:18.271
Phew! Ugh, I feel
so much better, ha-ha-ha.

01:11:18.338 --> 01:11:22.742
- That was, uh, trying, to say the least.
- Am I right?

01:11:22.809 --> 01:11:25.278
Yeah? Star?
Heh-heh. Yeah?

01:11:35.554 --> 01:11:39.725
Breathe it
in, team, that's the smell of our Earth.

01:11:39.792 --> 01:11:43.195
Kinda smells like...

01:11:43.262 --> 01:11:44.397
garbage.

01:11:44.464 --> 01:11:45.898
No "kinda" about that.

01:11:45.964 --> 01:11:48.233
I thought the garbage
smell was intentional.

01:11:48.300 --> 01:11:50.836
So did we level up?
I don't feel any different.

01:11:50.903 --> 01:11:52.838
That's because
we didn't, Beast Boy.

01:11:52.905 --> 01:11:54.807
Well, we already know
you didn't, three heads.

01:11:54.873 --> 01:11:59.577
This adventure was never about me
leveling up, it was about Raven.

01:11:59.644 --> 01:12:01.813
And, boy,
did she ever level up!

01:12:01.879 --> 01:12:03.948
Ha. Thanks, handsome.

01:12:04.016 --> 01:12:06.051
The important thing is
it's all over.

01:12:06.118 --> 01:12:10.955
And you know the best part of a
Multiverse-imperiling superhero crossover event?

01:12:12.291 --> 01:12:13.658
What?

01:12:13.724 --> 01:12:16.027
Aw, don't ask him,
now he's gonna explain it.

01:12:16.094 --> 01:12:18.763
It's that there won't be
another one for at least a year.

01:12:22.366 --> 01:12:24.235
Pitiful maggots of Earth!

01:12:24.302 --> 01:12:28.906
Prepare to be obliterated by
Darkseid and the Armies of Apokolips!

01:12:30.975 --> 01:12:32.043
- No way.
- Nopes.

01:12:32.110 --> 01:12:33.643
- Hard pass!
- No, Mr. Seid.

01:12:33.710 --> 01:12:34.744
I'm out.

01:12:34.811 --> 01:12:36.447
<i>♪ We are, we are Teen Titans ♪</i>

01:12:36.514 --> 01:12:38.682
<i>♪ We are, we are Teen Titans ♪</i>

01:12:38.748 --> 01:12:40.585
<i>♪ We are, we are Teen Titans ♪</i>

01:12:40.684 --> 01:12:42.953
<i>♪ We are, we are Teen Titans ♪</i>

01:12:59.269 --> 01:13:01.972
Where are the Teen Titans?

01:13:02.038 --> 01:13:05.408
The tall ones!
Not the short ones!

01:13:12.014 --> 01:13:15.252
Ugh, what's he doing now?

01:13:15.318 --> 01:13:19.456
The big jerk and the little flying
jerks are building a giant tower.

01:13:19.523 --> 01:13:20.656
Of course they are.

01:13:20.723 --> 01:13:22.124
How the original.

01:13:22.191 --> 01:13:24.960
Now the tower is firing
a laser into the sky.

01:13:25.027 --> 01:13:27.396
Bet it's going to
open a portal.

01:13:27.463 --> 01:13:29.732
The laser's opening
a portal over the city.

01:13:29.798 --> 01:13:31.033
Called it.

01:13:31.100 --> 01:13:32.468
But what is coming out
of the portal?

01:13:32.535 --> 01:13:33.569
More jerks.

01:13:33.636 --> 01:13:36.138
It is always the more jerks.
