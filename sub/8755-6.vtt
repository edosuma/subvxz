WEBVTT

00:10.364 --> 00:12.562
Something happened. Bam, bam, bam.

00:12.781 --> 00:14.644
I felt hands push on my back.

00:14.744 --> 00:16.126
And I just kept
flippin' down the stairs.

00:16.229 --> 00:19.063
I think he's [bleep] with
people's heads really bad.

00:19.165 --> 00:21.761
It was a deep, animalistic
growl, like...

00:23.446 --> 00:26.430
It's just gonna happen
again and again and again.

00:26.532 --> 00:28.766
I don't know if we are just crazy.

00:28.868 --> 00:30.768
He's like, "You think you can stop me?

00:30.870 --> 00:32.101
Because you can't."

00:32.204 --> 00:35.739
He is bent on revenge.

00:36.283 --> 00:39.184
There's a dark presence.

00:39.286 --> 00:41.320
My name is Amy Allan.

00:41.422 --> 00:43.322
These things, they're freaking out.

00:43.424 --> 00:44.344
They're from hell.

00:44.425 --> 00:45.424
I see dead people.

00:45.526 --> 00:46.692
They were being hunted.

00:46.794 --> 00:48.460
I speak to dead people.

00:48.563 --> 00:50.362
They were setting people on fire,

00:50.464 --> 00:51.497
burning them alive.

00:51.599 --> 00:52.998
And they speak to me.

00:53.100 --> 00:54.300
Her neck got broken.

00:54.402 --> 00:56.769
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

00:56.871 --> 00:58.771
I hear a gunshot.

00:58.873 --> 01:00.339
I rely on my partner.

01:00.441 --> 01:01.974
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

01:02.076 --> 01:04.155
I'm a retired New York
City homicide detective.

01:04.254 --> 01:05.354
Something's not right here.

01:05.456 --> 01:08.724
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

01:08.826 --> 01:09.892
It's not safe here.

01:09.994 --> 01:10.993
It's my job to reveal them.

01:11.095 --> 01:12.545
Are any of them buried on the property?

01:12.630 --> 01:13.696
They're all buried here.

01:13.798 --> 01:16.165
But Steve and I never speak...

01:16.267 --> 01:18.201
We never communicate
during an investigation.

01:18.303 --> 01:19.602
Until the very end...

01:19.704 --> 01:20.903
I can't do it no more.

01:21.005 --> 01:22.939
When we uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

01:23.024 --> 01:24.289
Holy [bleep] Look at this.

01:24.389 --> 01:25.739
Or time to get out.

01:25.857 --> 01:27.223
It does not have a happy ending.

01:27.325 --> 01:29.492
Something kills people here.

01:43.962 --> 01:46.646
I'm in the small town of
Sicily Island, Louisiana.

01:46.731 --> 01:49.009
It's about two hours
north of Baton Rouge.

01:50.552 --> 01:52.965
I got a call from a woman
who sounded real bad,

01:53.065 --> 01:54.138
and I mean terrible.

01:54.238 --> 01:55.804
She says whatever's in her house

01:55.906 --> 01:58.273
is goin' after her
children and her grandchild.

01:58.375 --> 02:00.425
She told me, if we can't help her,

02:00.544 --> 02:01.877
someone's gonna get hurt.

02:04.882 --> 02:06.415
Before Amy arrives,

02:06.517 --> 02:09.084
I clear the area of
any leading information,

02:09.169 --> 02:11.486
covering anything that
might reveal to Amy

02:11.588 --> 02:12.921
who lives in the house.

02:13.023 --> 02:14.473
When I'm done,

02:14.591 --> 02:16.258
the location will be
ready for tonight's walk.

02:28.172 --> 02:31.740
There's a lot of men.

02:31.842 --> 02:35.510
They're, like forming a big circle.

02:35.612 --> 02:38.430
But they're, like,
very active over there.

02:38.515 --> 02:41.083
I don't like it.

02:42.286 --> 02:46.321
There are a lot of these men.

02:46.423 --> 02:47.856
How many would you say?

02:47.958 --> 02:49.541
I would say like 100.

02:49.626 --> 02:55.230
They go all the way
around in the circle,

02:55.332 --> 02:58.400
all the way around.

02:58.485 --> 02:59.868
They're surrounding the place.

03:08.045 --> 03:08.954
Well, when I
talked to you on the phone,

03:09.054 --> 03:10.253
you sounded really upset.

03:10.389 --> 03:12.189
I'm at wits' end.

03:12.390 --> 03:15.224
We bought this place
a couple of years ago.

03:15.326 --> 03:17.945
This is goin' to be our retirement home,

03:18.045 --> 03:19.511
the dream home I always wanted.

03:19.613 --> 03:21.563
Two or three months in, you know,

03:21.648 --> 03:23.315
then, things started changing.

03:23.417 --> 03:25.684
The family is at each other's throats.

03:25.786 --> 03:28.453
My husband and I have
been together since 1987.

03:28.555 --> 03:31.556
We've never argued, never had a fight.

03:31.658 --> 03:33.558
We were always known
as the happy family.

03:33.660 --> 03:37.145
Now I've had fantasies
that I want everybody gone.

03:37.230 --> 03:38.262
It's gotten to the point where

03:38.362 --> 03:39.778
we're on the verge of divorce

03:39.880 --> 03:42.332
because we don't even
like to look at each other

03:42.432 --> 03:44.148
without feeling some kind of resentment,

03:44.267 --> 03:45.383
and we don't know why.

03:45.502 --> 03:45.828
All right.

03:45.928 --> 03:47.278
So who exactly lives
in the house with you?

03:47.363 --> 03:51.132
We have my husband, Johnny, myself.

03:51.234 --> 03:54.591
Then, we have Chelsea, who is 22.

03:54.691 --> 03:55.690
Okay.

03:55.775 --> 03:58.776
And then Jonathan, who is 26,

03:58.862 --> 04:01.629
and then my youngest daughter, Brittany,

04:01.714 --> 04:04.031
who's 19, and then the grandbaby,

04:04.133 --> 04:05.850
who just turned a year old in February.

04:05.935 --> 04:08.803
Give me a list of what
everybody's going through.

04:08.938 --> 04:14.108
Footsteps, shadows,
apparitions, things moving.

04:14.210 --> 04:17.445
It's starting to get violent.

04:17.547 --> 04:19.779
Pat, it gets me concerned
when you say "violent."

04:19.916 --> 04:20.998
What are we talkin' about?

04:21.117 --> 04:22.833
I've had a daughter
pushed down the stairs.

04:22.952 --> 04:25.836
I've had one pinned up against her wall.

04:25.922 --> 04:27.655
Oh, geez.

04:27.757 --> 04:30.124
What are you hoping we can do
for you now that we're here?

04:30.226 --> 04:33.127
We trust you guys, and we're
really hoping and praying

04:33.229 --> 04:35.062
that you can give us some answers,

04:35.198 --> 04:37.398
help us find out what
we're dealing with.

04:39.969 --> 04:43.070
But they definitely see them,

04:43.172 --> 04:45.406
and they do see them like shadow people.

04:45.508 --> 04:48.576
They can be physical and very direct.

04:50.246 --> 04:52.113
They can completely
interact with the living,

04:52.215 --> 04:53.781
and they can absolutely affect them.

04:53.883 --> 04:58.319
This place is all about revenge.

04:58.421 --> 05:00.688
Mm.

05:00.790 --> 05:03.557
Different people want revenge.

05:03.626 --> 05:05.209
What do they want to do?

05:05.295 --> 05:11.098
They would like to
murder and torture people.

05:14.637 --> 05:16.637
Okay. So what's going on in here?

05:16.739 --> 05:19.106
It's a lot of activity
that goes on in here.

05:19.208 --> 05:21.375
So I haven't slept in a year and a half.

05:21.477 --> 05:22.810
Okay, so what are we talkin' about?

05:22.912 --> 05:24.045
What kind of activity?

05:24.147 --> 05:26.547
- I've heard some growling.
- What did it sound like?

05:26.649 --> 05:30.084
It was a deep, throaty,
animalistic growl, like...

05:32.238 --> 05:33.921
What about animals, stray animals,

05:34.023 --> 05:36.440
do a growling noise like that?

05:36.559 --> 05:39.036
No, no. There is no stray
animals that run around.

05:39.136 --> 05:40.686
And then, I've seen shadow people

05:40.771 --> 05:41.904
in the corner of the room.

05:42.006 --> 05:44.290
Okay. Describe 'em to me.

05:44.408 --> 05:46.192
It's a group of five or six,

05:46.310 --> 05:48.110
I would say, just standing there.

05:48.196 --> 05:49.762
I mean, you got a big window here.

05:49.881 --> 05:51.430
Could it possibly be
people from outside?

05:51.549 --> 05:52.648
I don't see how.

05:52.750 --> 05:54.350
Not at night.

05:54.452 --> 05:56.485
I don't see how.

06:06.364 --> 06:11.166
Oh, I just saw this huge [bleep] thing.

06:11.269 --> 06:13.402
He, like, bent down,
and then, he stood up.

06:13.487 --> 06:14.737
And he was, like, enormous.

06:14.872 --> 06:16.205
How tall would you say?

06:16.307 --> 06:19.191
As tall as the ceiling.

06:19.310 --> 06:22.545
Is he related to the ones outside?

06:22.647 --> 06:25.281
Yes. He just He comes in.

06:25.383 --> 06:28.150
Then, he's just stare...
you know, standing there.

06:28.252 --> 06:30.152
Do you think people have seen him?

06:30.254 --> 06:31.320
Yes.

06:31.422 --> 06:34.023
It was a vision from
the person in the bed.

06:44.802 --> 06:46.368
I was talking to your wife, Pat,

06:46.470 --> 06:47.603
and she's pretty upset.

06:47.705 --> 06:49.271
She thinks that
whatever's happening here

06:49.373 --> 06:50.606
is tearing the family apart.

06:50.691 --> 06:52.224
I believe so, yeah.

06:52.343 --> 06:53.576
She said to me, you know,

06:53.661 --> 06:55.394
she fantasizes about
being alone in the house.

06:55.479 --> 06:56.528
Right.

06:56.647 --> 06:58.397
I mean, does that sound like Pat to you?

06:58.516 --> 07:00.849
Ordinarily, no. Since
we've been here, yes.

07:00.952 --> 07:04.453
I get the feeling that she
would be okay with me leavin'.

07:04.538 --> 07:06.338
So you think she's allowing the house

07:06.457 --> 07:07.856
to come between you guys?

07:07.959 --> 07:09.158
Yep. She's obsessed with it.

07:09.260 --> 07:11.677
To me, there's nothin'
more important than family.

07:11.762 --> 07:13.512
I mean, I could care
less about this house.

07:13.598 --> 07:14.730
Now, what about yourself?

07:14.815 --> 07:16.565
Have you ever experienced
anything in the house?

07:16.651 --> 07:18.200
Yeah.

07:18.302 --> 07:20.703
I've seen the silhouette of a man

07:20.805 --> 07:22.504
at the top of the stairs.

07:22.607 --> 07:25.841
It was, uh, a dark figure.

07:25.943 --> 07:27.643
And it looked like he had a beard.

07:27.745 --> 07:29.144
Okay. Anything else?

07:29.246 --> 07:31.313
I've heard things
fall, uh, or...

07:31.415 --> 07:32.982
or being thrown,

07:33.084 --> 07:35.718
like maybe somebody
dropped a book on carpet.

07:35.820 --> 07:37.586
How often are you hearing these sounds?

07:37.688 --> 07:39.355
I've just heard 'em a few times,

07:39.490 --> 07:42.191
but everyone else tells me
they hear 'em all the time.

07:42.293 --> 07:43.993
What do you think's in this house?

07:44.078 --> 07:46.045
I haven't got an idea, but if it's evil,

07:46.163 --> 07:47.863
then it's got to be some
kind of demonic figure.

07:47.965 --> 07:52.201
If it's somethin' bad,
I'm... I'm not gonna stay.

07:52.303 --> 07:56.338
I just saw another shadow
person in the hallway.

07:57.842 --> 07:59.341
It was right here.

07:59.443 --> 08:01.944
And then, it crawled up
the back of the stairs.

08:02.029 --> 08:03.379
And then, it popped through this stair.

08:03.481 --> 08:06.131
But it makes a lot of
noise, a lot of ruckus.

08:06.250 --> 08:08.584
It would be, like, a lot
of crashing and banging.

08:08.686 --> 08:10.085
And I think they might hear, like,

08:10.187 --> 08:11.320
the grunting and the growling.

08:11.422 --> 08:16.025
It was angry that we
came into its space.

08:37.909 --> 08:39.601
When I was talkin' to
your mom, she mentioned that

08:39.701 --> 08:42.184
her and your dad were
talking about divorce.

08:42.284 --> 08:44.085
That started about a month or two

08:44.187 --> 08:45.887
after we moved into this house.

08:46.022 --> 08:49.290
Honestly, I don't like it.

08:49.375 --> 08:51.659
I feel like the house is
just tearing us all apart.

08:51.761 --> 08:54.412
All right, now, she's
concerned about your son.

08:54.530 --> 08:56.642
Think she has a reason to be concerned?

08:56.742 --> 08:57.707
I do.

08:57.809 --> 08:59.275
And why do you say that?

08:59.377 --> 09:02.245
Um, I was about six to
seven months pregnant,

09:02.347 --> 09:04.180
and I was comin' out of the bathroom.

09:04.282 --> 09:07.283
And I felt hands push on my back.

09:07.385 --> 09:09.686
And I just kept
flippin' down the stairs.

09:12.040 --> 09:13.590
I mean, that's some
friggin' fall you took.

09:13.692 --> 09:15.625
So how bad you get hurt?

09:15.710 --> 09:16.876
Scrapes and bruises.

09:16.995 --> 09:18.228
They did suspect

09:18.363 --> 09:20.163
that I was going into premature labor.

09:20.265 --> 09:22.098
But they were able to slow it down.

09:22.184 --> 09:23.233
Okay.

09:23.335 --> 09:25.101
- You got lucky on that one.
- Oh, yeah.

09:25.187 --> 09:27.303
Seen people fall less than that

09:27.439 --> 09:29.506
and break their neck and died.

09:29.608 --> 09:31.007
I feel like something was

09:31.109 --> 09:33.076
intentionally trying
to make me lose my son.

09:37.315 --> 09:41.317
I'm seeing this... old man.

09:41.403 --> 09:43.586
He's pissed.

09:43.672 --> 09:45.738
There's a lot of anger here,

09:45.857 --> 09:48.191
a lot of tension...

09:49.744 --> 09:53.930
'Cause he is bent on revenge.

09:58.270 --> 10:00.503
So a woman died up here.

10:00.572 --> 10:02.972
Way in her death state.

10:03.074 --> 10:04.707
She's puking.

10:04.810 --> 10:06.142
She's really sick.

10:06.244 --> 10:08.378
Now I'm feeling pain.

10:08.480 --> 10:10.046
Ugh.

10:10.148 --> 10:12.615
It literally feels like
I'm being stabbed to death.

10:12.701 --> 10:14.317
The old man's like, "Oh. Ha-ha.

10:14.419 --> 10:17.253
You think you can stop me?
You think you can stop me?

10:17.355 --> 10:18.922
Because you can't."

10:19.057 --> 10:21.257
He's like, "And it's
just gonna happen again

10:21.359 --> 10:24.160
and again and again and again."

10:24.296 --> 10:25.495
What is?

10:25.630 --> 10:27.397
Women gettin' killed.

10:34.773 --> 10:37.674
Seems like everybody in the
house is having experiences.

10:37.776 --> 10:39.409
What about you?

10:39.511 --> 10:40.793
I would wake up sometimes

10:40.912 --> 10:43.213
to feel like someone's
hand was on my neck.

10:43.315 --> 10:45.949
Kind of just woke me up
like I was gasping for air.

10:46.051 --> 10:47.800
How many times has this happened to you?

10:47.886 --> 10:51.721
It has happened at least a dozen times.

10:51.806 --> 10:55.225
Okay. So has anything else happened?

10:55.327 --> 10:57.610
Three times, on separate occasions

10:57.696 --> 11:01.281
since I've lived here in the
two years, I would wake up,

11:01.366 --> 11:02.699
and there'd be open razor blades

11:02.784 --> 11:03.967
sitting where I was sleeping.

11:04.069 --> 11:05.134
I mean, are you [bleep] with me?

11:05.408 --> 11:06.404
Or are you tellin' me
the truth about this?

11:06.504 --> 11:07.427
I'm tellin' you the truth.

11:07.527 --> 11:08.742
So basically, what you're tellin' me is

11:08.861 --> 11:10.194
every night you go
to bed, you don't know

11:10.296 --> 11:12.324
if you're gonna get choked,
woken up by razor blades?

11:12.424 --> 11:15.352
Do you have any idea
how [bleep] this sounds?

11:15.452 --> 11:16.518
Yeah.

11:16.620 --> 11:18.687
I don't know if it's the house

11:18.772 --> 11:21.823
or if we are just crazy.

11:24.995 --> 11:27.863
I don't really
like it in here, either.

11:27.965 --> 11:30.899
This dead guy is the
main [bleep] problem.

11:31.034 --> 11:33.268
I think he can cause hallucinations.

11:34.738 --> 11:37.873
I think he can [bleep]
people's heads really bad.

11:37.975 --> 11:41.409
He can cause physical
pain, um, to the living.

11:41.495 --> 11:43.445
He's very creepy.

11:43.547 --> 11:46.448
He can cause, like, stabbing pain,

11:46.550 --> 11:51.253
cutting pain, burning
pain, um, choking pain,

11:51.355 --> 11:53.455
um, things like that.

12:00.864 --> 12:01.931
I was talkin' to mom

12:02.031 --> 12:03.664
about some of the bizarre
stuff goin' on here.

12:03.766 --> 12:05.049
Now, she thinks that whatever's here

12:05.134 --> 12:06.934
is tearing the family apart.
Do you agree with that?

12:07.019 --> 12:09.870
We used to be a pretty
close, tight-knit family.

12:09.972 --> 12:13.440
We just kind of barely can
stand the sight of each other.

12:13.576 --> 12:15.860
As far as your experiences,
you've had some, I understand.

12:15.945 --> 12:17.161
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

12:17.280 --> 12:18.879
Why don't you tell me about one of 'em?

12:18.981 --> 12:23.684
I woke up one night, um,
in a really odd position.

12:23.786 --> 12:26.487
I was, uh, up my wall.

12:26.589 --> 12:28.923
And my feet were kind of dangling.

12:29.025 --> 12:30.658
So you're basically
pinned on the ceiling?

12:30.743 --> 12:31.792
Mm-hmm.

12:31.878 --> 12:33.494
That's something out of a movie.

12:34.597 --> 12:35.996
You sure you didn't dream that?

12:36.098 --> 12:37.064
I'm positive.

12:37.166 --> 12:39.049
I fell down onto the bed.

12:39.135 --> 12:41.152
All right. What else has happened?

12:41.270 --> 12:42.670
I was actually having, um,

12:42.772 --> 12:45.573
a pretty strange nightmare,
which is what woke me up.

12:45.675 --> 12:49.226
I was being pinned down by a woman.

12:49.345 --> 12:52.613
Um, and she had her hands
over my mouth and my nose.

12:52.698 --> 12:54.565
So, Chelsea, if you saw this woman again

12:54.650 --> 12:56.054
in a sketch or a photo
or somethin' like that,

12:56.154 --> 12:57.353
would you recognize her?

12:57.488 --> 12:59.755
Actually, a year after I had the dream

12:59.857 --> 13:02.591
that my mom was doin'
some research on the house

13:02.694 --> 13:05.261
and came across a photo
of Nettie Fairbanks.

13:05.346 --> 13:06.362
Okay.

13:06.464 --> 13:07.830
And, um...

13:07.915 --> 13:10.383
it was the woman from my nightmares.

13:10.501 --> 13:12.301
- This person lived here?
- Yes.

13:14.806 --> 13:18.107
A lot of the old man's anger, like,

13:18.242 --> 13:22.044
just fills every nook
and cranny in here.

13:22.146 --> 13:26.916
He just comes in, and it's
like just all this rage.

13:27.018 --> 13:29.985
I think that there's a living person.

13:30.071 --> 13:32.438
Um, he's, like, stomping her down.

13:32.523 --> 13:36.258
Like, he's stomping her down.

13:36.361 --> 13:38.878
And because of the
hallucinations and stuff,

13:38.963 --> 13:42.798
I don't think there's a
lot of sleep to be had.

13:42.884 --> 13:46.035
He gets in there, and he's,
like, pullin' stuff out,

13:46.137 --> 13:49.138
like, nasty [bleep].

13:49.240 --> 13:54.160
And, like, making these weird
hallucinations around it.

13:54.278 --> 13:57.580
He does not want them here.

13:57.665 --> 14:01.317
And I think that he

14:01.419 --> 14:07.523
is trying to figure out how exactly

14:07.625 --> 14:11.494
to get rid of them.

14:11.596 --> 14:15.364
He's a mean [bleep].

14:33.411 --> 14:34.938
Chelsea thinks that some woman

14:35.038 --> 14:36.771
named Nettie Fairbanks
is haunting her house.

14:36.857 --> 14:39.307
Now, when clients do their own research,

14:39.393 --> 14:40.642
I take it with a grain of salt,

14:40.777 --> 14:43.111
but I reached out to a
state historian who says

14:43.197 --> 14:45.197
that woman really did live in the house

14:45.282 --> 14:48.233
and that her time there was
filled with nothing but tragedy.

14:53.657 --> 14:55.223
So, Charlotte,

14:55.325 --> 14:57.058
it's true that Nettie Fairbanks lived in

14:57.144 --> 14:58.543
my clients' property and in the house.

14:58.662 --> 14:59.712
Yes, that's true.

14:59.812 --> 15:00.978
Okay. So what do we know about her?

15:01.486 --> 15:02.952
Well, in 1892,

15:03.088 --> 15:05.421
Henry Fairbanks actually
bought the property.

15:05.507 --> 15:07.874
He fell in love with Henrietta Blackman,

15:07.959 --> 15:09.559
who he called Nettie.

15:09.628 --> 15:11.794
And I have a photo of her for you.

15:11.880 --> 15:13.796
Okay, so this is good news

15:13.899 --> 15:17.517
because my client said
she saw this woman.

15:17.636 --> 15:19.969
Now, did she and Henry have any kids?

15:20.055 --> 15:22.455
Yes. They have three children.

15:22.541 --> 15:24.274
Two boys, Russell and Thomas,

15:24.376 --> 15:26.309
and a little girl named Henrietta.

15:26.394 --> 15:28.178
Now, Charlotte, you
mentioned on the phone

15:28.263 --> 15:30.880
that this woman in the
family had a life of tragedy.

15:30.966 --> 15:32.248
What'd you mean?

15:32.350 --> 15:35.468
Well, in 1899, the night
that Henrietta was born,

15:35.554 --> 15:37.136
Henry had a terrible accident.

15:37.222 --> 15:39.289
- Okay.
- He was out celebrating.

15:39.391 --> 15:41.524
And he decided to
ride home on his horse.

15:41.610 --> 15:43.910
He was stinking, fall-down drunk.

15:44.029 --> 15:46.529
And he fell in a water-filled ditch.

15:46.631 --> 15:48.270
This would seem harmless,

15:48.370 --> 15:49.903
but he actually caught pneumonia

15:49.988 --> 15:51.671
from the dirty water he fell into,

15:51.757 --> 15:53.206
and he died three days later.

15:53.291 --> 15:55.075
Oh, you're kiddin' me.

15:55.160 --> 15:58.926
The following year, in 1900,
her baby boy, Thomas, dies.

15:59.026 --> 16:00.860
He was three years old at the time.

16:00.945 --> 16:02.394
Okay. Do we know how Thomas died?

16:02.480 --> 16:04.580
There are no details how he died.

16:04.665 --> 16:06.782
Okay, so, now her husband's
dead, her kid's dead.

16:06.918 --> 16:08.300
Does she stay on the property?

16:08.419 --> 16:09.752
She did stay after that.

16:09.887 --> 16:12.054
In 1901, she actually marries again.

16:12.156 --> 16:14.557
This time, she marries
a traveling dentist,

16:14.642 --> 16:17.526
Dr. Henry Joseph Disch.

16:17.628 --> 16:18.928
And that is his photo.

16:19.030 --> 16:21.163
I mean, do things go well?
She live happily ever after?

16:21.299 --> 16:22.498
What happens?

16:22.633 --> 16:24.200
Actually, no. As it turns out,

16:24.302 --> 16:26.902
Nettie's daughter was
born with epilepsy.

16:26.988 --> 16:29.038
Here's a photo of Henrietta.

16:29.123 --> 16:32.174
She suffered from severe seizures.

16:32.276 --> 16:33.809
She became difficult to handle.

16:33.945 --> 16:36.178
So when she was 22 years
old, she was sent away

16:36.280 --> 16:39.915
to the Louisiana State
Hospital for the Insane.

16:40.001 --> 16:45.070
In 1922, at the age of 23,
Henrietta dies in the hospital.

16:45.189 --> 16:49.325
According to her death
record, she died of epilepsy.

16:49.410 --> 16:52.294
Okay.

16:52.380 --> 16:54.797
Nettie remains on the
property another 10 years.

16:54.932 --> 16:55.965
Okay.

16:56.067 --> 16:58.133
She becomes weak and
suffers from an illness

16:58.236 --> 17:01.804
that eventually leads
to a cerebral hemorrhage.

17:01.889 --> 17:03.806
Here's her death certificate.

17:03.891 --> 17:04.973
Okay.

17:05.076 --> 17:07.609
She dies in 1932 at the age of 58.

17:07.744 --> 17:10.079
Does she die on the property?

17:10.164 --> 17:12.214
She actually dies at her son's home.

17:12.300 --> 17:14.016
But according to descendants,

17:14.101 --> 17:16.886
her body was brought back
to her home for the wake.

17:16.971 --> 17:19.488
Okay. That's interesting.

17:19.589 --> 17:24.159
Some of these... Like, there
was a lot of death here.

17:24.262 --> 17:26.161
There were, like, three or four deaths.

17:26.230 --> 17:29.231
Something happened. Bam, bam, bam.

17:29.333 --> 17:33.502
But they had, like,
some kind of private,

17:33.604 --> 17:37.306
like, uh, ceremonies here or something.

17:39.010 --> 17:41.293
It's all in embarrassment.

17:41.379 --> 17:44.647
They're talking about
this sister in particular.

17:44.749 --> 17:47.066
And everybody's, like,
talking like this.

17:47.184 --> 17:50.219
"Uh, we have to do something
because it's just awful.

17:50.304 --> 17:52.254
It's just too embarrassing."

17:52.356 --> 17:54.590
Yeah. I don't even know
who's dead because, honestly,

17:54.692 --> 17:57.192
it's like, they're just, like,
literally shoved in a corner.

17:57.295 --> 17:59.228
So you can't see the actual body?

17:59.330 --> 18:00.646
No.

18:00.765 --> 18:03.032
I want to say it's a male and a female.

18:03.134 --> 18:06.502
I think the male is the old man
causing all the problems here.

18:06.587 --> 18:08.470
Ah.

18:08.573 --> 18:10.656
All right.

18:10.775 --> 18:12.458
So who's on the property at this point?

18:12.577 --> 18:14.877
After Nettie, her
son, Russell Fairbanks,

18:14.962 --> 18:16.262
moved onto the property.

18:16.380 --> 18:18.397
This is a photo of Russell.

18:18.516 --> 18:20.099
Okay. What's his story?

18:20.184 --> 18:22.368
Well, actually, he was a
well-known, prominent man

18:22.486 --> 18:23.586
in the community.

18:23.654 --> 18:25.688
He had followed in his
stepfather's footsteps

18:25.790 --> 18:27.022
and become a dentist.

18:27.108 --> 18:30.359
Well, in 1971, Russell
suffers his own tragic death.

18:30.461 --> 18:32.494
He decides to take a fishing trip

18:32.630 --> 18:35.164
one mile from his
home, on Lake Lovelace.

18:35.266 --> 18:36.832
Okay. So what happens at the lake?

18:36.934 --> 18:38.167
Well, no one knows why,

18:38.269 --> 18:40.803
but for some reason, he fell overboard.

18:40.905 --> 18:42.104
He drowned.

18:42.239 --> 18:45.691
Here's a newspaper article.
He was 75 at the time.

18:45.810 --> 18:47.610
He was a rugged man's man.

18:47.695 --> 18:51.680
And there's really no indication
of why he fell overboard.

18:51.782 --> 18:53.182
It's a mystery.

18:53.284 --> 18:55.317
That's interesting.

18:56.854 --> 18:58.854
This guy
causing all the problems,

18:58.956 --> 19:00.856
do you know how old he was when he died?

19:00.958 --> 19:02.758
Late 60s, early 70s.

19:02.860 --> 19:03.926
He lived here then, you think?

19:04.028 --> 19:06.328
I believe he did.

19:06.464 --> 19:09.198
Like, I think he died with
his shirt off or something.

19:09.333 --> 19:11.533
Like, he walks around without a shirt.

19:11.636 --> 19:12.868
He had a lot of money.

19:12.970 --> 19:15.220
And I think people
really [bleep] respected

19:15.306 --> 19:18.157
the [bleep] out of him.

19:22.446 --> 19:24.029
He's just, like, raving.

19:24.148 --> 19:27.483
Like, he's like a [bleep]
lunatic about this woman.

19:27.585 --> 19:29.652
"[Bleep] hate her,
and she's gonna eat it.

19:29.754 --> 19:31.453
She's gonna [bleep] eat it."

19:37.477 --> 19:38.876
If you need us to investigate

19:38.979 --> 19:40.562
unexplained activity in your home,

19:40.647 --> 19:43.263
go to the "Dead Files"
page at travelchannel.com.

19:43.363 --> 19:45.563
Click on "Help Me, Dead
Files!" to submit your story,

19:45.648 --> 19:46.964
and we'll help if we can.

19:56.385 --> 19:58.690
So far, I've got
a family being torn apart

19:58.790 --> 20:00.705
by unexplained activity on a property

20:00.805 --> 20:04.356
that's seen one tragic
death after another.

20:04.442 --> 20:06.325
But I want to see if
there's anything else

20:06.460 --> 20:08.610
that might help my investigation.

20:08.729 --> 20:10.079
Searching through old records,

20:10.164 --> 20:12.271
I find a man named William Ditto.

20:12.371 --> 20:14.704
Turns out he used to run a plantation

20:14.790 --> 20:16.556
right on my clients' property.

20:16.658 --> 20:19.960
So I've asked a local
genealogist to meet me here.

20:20.062 --> 20:22.028
He says William Ditto got destroyed

20:22.114 --> 20:24.364
defending the Confederate cause.

20:27.903 --> 20:29.669
In the 1860s,

20:29.771 --> 20:33.473
William Lego Ditto owned
your clients' property.

20:33.575 --> 20:36.877
He was a lawyer and a slave owner.

20:36.962 --> 20:39.045
This guy was pretty
wealthy, I would assume.

20:39.131 --> 20:41.248
He was a very, very wealthy man.

20:41.350 --> 20:44.201
He was worth $120,000 at that time,

20:44.319 --> 20:46.052
which was a lot of money.

20:46.138 --> 20:47.921
How many slaves did Ditto have?

20:48.023 --> 20:52.025
According to the 1860
census, he had 72 slaves.

20:52.127 --> 20:53.493
Okay. So that's a lot, right?

20:53.629 --> 20:56.329
That's a lot of slaves, yes.

20:56.431 --> 20:58.982
Slaves had very few rights.

20:59.067 --> 21:02.319
It was illegal to teach your
slaves to read and write.

21:02.437 --> 21:05.238
A slave owner could beat 'em.

21:05.340 --> 21:06.540
Ohh.

21:06.675 --> 21:08.625
That's pretty brutal.

21:08.744 --> 21:11.011
Even for a homicide detective,
this makes me squeamish

21:11.113 --> 21:12.779
just lookin' at this.

21:12.865 --> 21:14.397
Would I assume correctly that slaves

21:14.483 --> 21:16.149
would have been buried on the property?

21:16.235 --> 21:19.836
Yes, 'cause in this country
We're so warm and all...

21:19.955 --> 21:22.158
you had to bury a person quickly.

21:22.258 --> 21:24.775
Okay. Now, this guy, Ditto,

21:24.860 --> 21:27.166
you mentioned that he
was a staunch Confederate.

21:27.266 --> 21:31.451
Yes, he helped form a cavalry unit.

21:31.554 --> 21:34.037
He went and fought, I
believe it was in Kentucky.

21:34.123 --> 21:35.778
- Okay.
- And he was captured.

21:35.878 --> 21:38.428
He was prisoner of war for
about a year and a half.

21:38.528 --> 21:40.912
He was released from that the same day

21:41.047 --> 21:44.665
that Lee signed the treaty
for the end of the war.

21:44.751 --> 21:46.350
Okay. So this guy was a POW.

21:46.436 --> 21:47.518
- Right.
- What happens?

21:47.604 --> 21:50.688
He comes home. All the slaves are gone.

21:50.774 --> 21:52.590
If he had Confederate
money, it was worth nothing.

21:52.692 --> 21:55.553
All he had was the value of the land.

21:55.653 --> 21:57.286
So this guy basically went
off to fight in the war,

21:57.371 --> 21:58.620
came home, he lost everything.

21:58.706 --> 21:59.755
He lost everything.

21:59.840 --> 22:01.290
He ended up

22:01.392 --> 22:03.942
having to sell your
clients' property in 1868.

22:04.061 --> 22:05.444
Okay.

22:05.563 --> 22:07.229
And he moves to Florida.

22:07.364 --> 22:09.598
Not surprised to find that
there was slaves on the property,

22:09.683 --> 22:11.049
but my clients had no idea.

22:11.135 --> 22:14.542
Those slaves were not the
only slaves in Sicily Island.

22:14.642 --> 22:18.477
The Native Americans there
had slaves and were slaves.

22:18.563 --> 22:20.145
And you might want to look into that.

22:20.231 --> 22:22.514
Okay. Interesting.

22:27.955 --> 22:30.923
I'm trying to understand
who these shadow men are.

22:31.025 --> 22:34.159
I think they were human before.

22:34.262 --> 22:36.662
Do you have any idea when this was?

22:37.363 --> 22:41.666
I get, like, a 1798

22:41.751 --> 22:44.100
and then an 1843.

22:44.200 --> 22:46.033
Okay.

22:46.135 --> 22:49.570
I'm definitely hearing
about bad, bad deaths.

22:49.672 --> 22:54.408
I think they're all buried nearby.

22:54.493 --> 22:57.211
And they're just bent on revenge.

22:57.313 --> 23:00.047
Do you have any idea what
they want revenge for?

23:00.132 --> 23:02.649
How they were treated, like animals.

23:02.751 --> 23:05.235
They had to walk a lot.

23:06.739 --> 23:08.355
Their feet were bloody.

23:08.457 --> 23:10.407
And I do see chains.

23:10.493 --> 23:15.529
They don't want to go anywhere
because they want their revenge.

23:19.768 --> 23:21.335
You know, I
placed a couple calls,

23:21.470 --> 23:22.870
and Dave's lead checked out.

23:22.972 --> 23:24.688
The Native Americans in Sicily Island

23:24.807 --> 23:26.056
were sold off into slavery.

23:26.141 --> 23:28.492
I'm heading over to
meet with a local author

23:28.611 --> 23:30.377
who wants to show me the exact spot

23:30.462 --> 23:31.979
where the Natchez tribe was wiped out.

23:36.752 --> 23:40.120
We're really close to the
spot where the Natchez Indians

23:40.222 --> 23:42.723
made their last stand against the French

23:42.825 --> 23:44.391
in early 1731.

23:44.493 --> 23:46.827
So I know we're only a couple of
miles from my clients' property,

23:46.929 --> 23:48.345
so this is important then.

23:48.430 --> 23:49.930
So what can you tell me about the tribe?

23:50.015 --> 23:51.665
To give you an idea of
what they looked like,

23:51.767 --> 23:54.001
this is a modern representation.

23:54.136 --> 23:57.521
So I know you mentioned
that they were wiped out.

23:57.640 --> 23:58.555
How'd that all happen?

23:58.641 --> 24:01.074
In January of 1731,

24:01.160 --> 24:04.711
the French brought in
cannons, brought in mortars.

24:04.813 --> 24:07.180
And after pounding the place

24:07.283 --> 24:09.283
with things like...

24:09.385 --> 24:10.851
this...

24:10.936 --> 24:15.556
the vast majority of them are
taken prisoner by the French.

24:15.782 --> 24:18.529
They're taken down the
Mississippi to New Orleans

24:18.629 --> 24:20.163
and shipped off to Santo Domingo

24:20.263 --> 24:21.479
and probably end up

24:21.598 --> 24:23.381
being worked to death in
sugar cane fields there.

24:23.466 --> 24:24.766
So that's it.
There's no more...

24:24.851 --> 24:26.301
There's no Natchez Nation after that.

24:26.386 --> 24:28.603
Okay.

24:35.078 --> 24:37.512
I saw dozens of dead
people during my walk.

24:37.614 --> 24:40.114
But two have me the most concerned.

24:40.216 --> 24:43.084
First, the leader of the shadow men.

24:43.219 --> 24:46.120
I was in a bedroom. There
was a person in the bed.

24:47.590 --> 24:55.396
And there was this huge figure
coming in from the other room.

24:55.532 --> 25:00.902
Next, I describe the old
man terrorizing the living.

25:01.004 --> 25:03.438
He's white.

25:03.540 --> 25:06.374
He had jowls, kind of wrinkled.

25:06.459 --> 25:10.878
And he had deep-set eyes,

25:10.981 --> 25:12.981
like, kind of grumpy-looking.

25:17.387 --> 25:19.787
Is this who you saw?

25:21.091 --> 25:23.458
Yes.

25:43.951 --> 25:46.818
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

25:46.920 --> 25:48.920
we're ready to reveal
our findings to each other

25:49.022 --> 25:52.524
and our clients for the first time.

25:52.626 --> 25:54.176
So, Amy, I'd like you to meet Pat.

25:54.294 --> 25:56.628
And this is her husband, Johnny.

25:56.730 --> 25:59.931
Now, they bought this
fixer-upper about two years ago.

26:00.067 --> 26:02.033
They hoped to turn it into
their dream retirement home,

26:02.136 --> 26:03.268
and it's been anything but.

26:03.370 --> 26:05.370
Chelsea is one of their three

26:05.439 --> 26:07.172
grown children that live here.

26:07.241 --> 26:09.674
I got a photo of the other kids.

26:09.760 --> 26:13.512
This is Jonathan, and this is
Brittany, who also has a baby.

26:13.647 --> 26:14.846
Now, everyone here agrees

26:14.982 --> 26:17.065
there's something weird
going on, and I mean weird.

26:17.184 --> 26:19.117
But Pat doesn't want to leave.

26:19.253 --> 26:20.519
On the other hand,

26:20.621 --> 26:22.087
if Johnny doesn't like
what he hears tonight,

26:22.172 --> 26:24.189
he's ready to pack up and leave.

26:28.116 --> 26:30.197
So now that Amy knows a little
bit about what's goin' on,

26:30.297 --> 26:32.648
I'm gonna ask her to
describe her walk for us.

26:38.256 --> 26:40.823
One of the most disturbing
things that I encountered

26:40.909 --> 26:42.191
was actually outside.

26:42.277 --> 26:44.827
I saw about 100 shadow men.

26:44.929 --> 26:47.363
They were surrounding the house.

26:47.499 --> 26:48.398
Wow.

26:48.500 --> 26:50.466
These shadow people

26:50.552 --> 26:52.852
are extremely solid, and I felt like

26:52.971 --> 26:55.371
they could affect and
influence people in the area.

26:55.473 --> 26:57.974
And I do feel like

26:58.076 --> 27:01.778
they're capable of physical
contact with the living.

27:01.880 --> 27:03.913
Well, pretty much

27:04.015 --> 27:05.581
everybody in the house
has seen shadow figures.

27:05.683 --> 27:06.949
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

27:07.052 --> 27:08.384
I've seen it twice.

27:08.486 --> 27:11.587
In the corner of my bedroom,

27:11.689 --> 27:13.189
they were all standing
shoulder to shoulder,

27:13.291 --> 27:15.591
some in the backs, tall,
short, varying heights.

27:15.693 --> 27:18.528
I call them watchers.

27:18.596 --> 27:20.229
That's what they
were doing...

27:20.315 --> 27:22.331
just standing there,
observing and watching.

27:22.434 --> 27:24.867
Well, when I was in the master bedroom,

27:24.969 --> 27:29.305
I was seeing a situation
that took place,

27:29.407 --> 27:31.357
but I was seeing it through the eyes

27:31.476 --> 27:33.609
of the person who was laying in the bed.

27:33.695 --> 27:35.745
He, like, bent down,
and then, he stood up,

27:35.830 --> 27:37.413
and he was, like, enormous.

27:37.515 --> 27:38.848
How tall would you say?

27:38.950 --> 27:42.285
As tall as the ceiling.

27:42.387 --> 27:45.088
I did do a sketch.

27:52.063 --> 27:53.729
Oh, geez.

27:53.832 --> 27:55.331
Take a look at that.

28:00.071 --> 28:01.838
This is what I see.

28:01.923 --> 28:03.239
It's definitely unnerving.

28:06.125 --> 28:07.910
I don't need anybody watchin' me sleep.

28:08.825 --> 28:11.125
These shadow
things, what are they?

28:11.244 --> 28:13.063
Were they ever alive? What's the story?

28:13.163 --> 28:16.114
Yes, they were all
alive at one point in time.

28:16.199 --> 28:18.950
What I believe is that these people

28:19.035 --> 28:21.686
are from several different time periods.

28:21.822 --> 28:27.525
I did see men being beaten,
being treated like animals.

28:27.627 --> 28:31.663
A group of them had
walked a long distance.

28:31.765 --> 28:35.200
And their feet were bleeding.

28:35.302 --> 28:37.402
I saw some that were
chained and starving.

28:37.537 --> 28:39.437
I saw some dying.

28:39.523 --> 28:43.274
The one consistent element
with all of these men,

28:43.376 --> 28:46.728
mainly, um, is revenge.

28:46.813 --> 28:50.415
They want revenge for how they all died.

28:50.517 --> 28:52.484
Wow.

28:54.070 --> 28:58.156
I think a large percentage
of them are buried nearby.

28:58.258 --> 28:59.290
Hmm.

28:59.392 --> 29:01.125
And I got two
specific dates...

29:01.228 --> 29:04.262
1798 and 1843.

29:04.397 --> 29:07.165
Now, we're in the Deep
South, so it's no surprise

29:07.300 --> 29:09.250
that this place used to be
a plantation at one time.

29:09.369 --> 29:10.869
Now, back in 1860,

29:10.971 --> 29:14.873
your property was owned by a
guy named William Lego Ditto.

29:14.975 --> 29:16.975
Actually got a photo of him.

29:17.077 --> 29:18.409
Oh.

29:21.248 --> 29:24.949
That reminds me of the
silhouette that I saw.

29:25.051 --> 29:28.119
Couldn't make out any
real detail like this.

29:28.221 --> 29:31.356
But now that I see the picture
with the beard, the shape,

29:31.441 --> 29:34.125
it's a lot like what I was seein'.

29:34.227 --> 29:35.393
Interesting.

29:35.495 --> 29:37.862
He owned 72 slaves who worked the land.

29:37.964 --> 29:39.464
Now, we all know

29:39.599 --> 29:41.966
the conditions of slaves
and how inhumane it was.

29:42.068 --> 29:43.801
This is a picture.

29:43.937 --> 29:45.603
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

29:45.705 --> 29:49.407
This is as it healed.

29:51.761 --> 29:54.112
The expert I talked to
said, more than likely,

29:54.214 --> 29:56.948
you have a lot of buried slaves here

29:57.050 --> 29:58.516
in unmarked graves.

29:58.618 --> 30:00.952
Now, this guy, Ditto,
was a staunch Confederate.

30:01.054 --> 30:02.387
And he actually formed

30:02.472 --> 30:04.789
his own regiment right here
and went off to fight the war.

30:04.891 --> 30:07.559
Now, he wound up becomin' a POW.

30:07.661 --> 30:09.944
Came back here to nothing.

30:10.030 --> 30:11.996
Slaves were gone. Place was in ruins.

30:12.098 --> 30:14.966
Not only did he lose the
war, he lost everything.

30:15.035 --> 30:17.335
Now, here's the other surprising thing

30:17.420 --> 30:19.003
that I came up with during the research.

30:19.089 --> 30:21.339
There's another group of people
that lived on the land also

30:21.441 --> 30:22.910
that became slaves.

30:23.010 --> 30:24.926
This area was once occupied,

30:25.045 --> 30:27.295
in the 1700s, by the Native Americans.

30:27.414 --> 30:29.448
They're called the Natchez tribe.

30:29.550 --> 30:33.785
I got an artist's rendition of
what they might've looked like.

30:33.887 --> 30:37.255
In 1731, they got
wiped out by the French.

30:37.357 --> 30:39.107
Now, most of the tribe's
people were killed.

30:39.226 --> 30:41.927
- But 200 were taken prisoner.
- Mm.

30:42.029 --> 30:44.763
They were put in chains
and walked to New Orleans.

30:44.865 --> 30:45.897
Oh, my gosh.

30:45.999 --> 30:48.633
Where they were basically
sold into slavery.

30:48.735 --> 30:50.635
And they were sent to
the Dominican Republic,

30:50.721 --> 30:52.337
where they worked in sugar canes.

30:52.439 --> 30:54.072
The tribe was annihilated.

30:55.109 --> 30:57.742
You think these shadow people may be

30:57.845 --> 30:59.878
the slaves and the
Indians gettin' together?

30:59.980 --> 31:02.012
Yeah. Totally makes sense.

31:03.501 --> 31:04.785
- Inhumane.
- It is.

31:04.885 --> 31:05.984
No excuse.

31:06.086 --> 31:08.370
And I don't blame 'em
for wanting revenge.

31:08.489 --> 31:11.540
We're desecrating their resting place.

31:13.561 --> 31:15.761
So what else did you see?

31:15.829 --> 31:19.364
I went to the back
room behind the stairs.

31:19.450 --> 31:23.302
And I heard someone say
there was a lot of death here.

31:23.404 --> 31:24.937
And then, I got bam, bam, bam.

31:25.072 --> 31:26.972
And I heard three to four deaths.

31:27.074 --> 31:30.659
And then, I was seeing wakes
or funerals taking place.

31:30.778 --> 31:33.412
I heard people talking in hushed tones.

31:33.514 --> 31:36.582
I actually did overhear someone
talking about how embarrassing,

31:36.717 --> 31:38.116
uh, about the sister

31:38.218 --> 31:41.219
and that she was kind of
messed up or something.

31:41.355 --> 31:43.855
And I was seeing two
bodies in the corner.

31:43.941 --> 31:45.524
One was male, and one was female.

31:45.609 --> 31:46.825
The male was elderly.

31:46.911 --> 31:49.912
And then, when I walked up the stairs,

31:50.030 --> 31:53.732
I ran into a woman who
was in her death state.

31:53.817 --> 31:57.836
And it was an extremely painful death.

31:57.922 --> 32:01.340
She wasn't able to catch her breath.

32:01.442 --> 32:04.176
And I suddenly felt like I
was being stabbed to death

32:04.278 --> 32:08.280
all through my stomach area.

32:10.050 --> 32:12.217
You okay, honey?

32:13.721 --> 32:16.154
Just started a few days ago

32:16.256 --> 32:17.789
where I couldn't catch my breath.

32:17.925 --> 32:21.059
And there was this... this
sharp pain in my chest.

32:21.145 --> 32:23.061
And I've had that stabbing pain

32:23.163 --> 32:27.582
in my side and my
stomach for months now.

32:30.004 --> 32:32.938
I'm assuming that's what
she's feeling, Amy, or...

32:33.073 --> 32:34.756
More than likely, yeah.

32:34.842 --> 32:37.409
This is what we know for sure.

32:37.494 --> 32:39.878
There was a woman whose wake
was held here in the house.

32:39.964 --> 32:42.280
She did die a very painful death.

32:42.366 --> 32:44.516
Her name was Nettie Fairbanks.

32:44.601 --> 32:47.119
And she moved into the house in 1894,

32:47.254 --> 32:48.787
when it was first built.

32:48.872 --> 32:50.622
I actually have a photograph of her.

32:52.292 --> 32:53.592
This is Nettie.

32:53.694 --> 32:56.428
Her time here was pretty miserable.

32:56.530 --> 32:58.330
In 1899, her husband got drunk,

32:58.432 --> 33:01.233
fell off his horse into some water,

33:01.318 --> 33:03.635
and wound up gettin' pneumonia
and died three days later.

33:03.737 --> 33:04.936
Mm.

33:05.039 --> 33:08.206
In 1900, her
three-year-old son died.

33:08.308 --> 33:10.892
We don't know what the causes are.

33:10.978 --> 33:13.362
She gets remarried to
this traveling dentist.

33:13.447 --> 33:16.581
Now, I tracked down a family portrait.

33:17.951 --> 33:21.219
This is her daughter, Henrietta.

33:21.305 --> 33:22.721
You mentioned somethin' about

33:22.856 --> 33:24.556
an embarrassment or something like that.

33:24.692 --> 33:25.640
Whoa, yeah.

33:25.759 --> 33:28.593
Okay. Now, Henrietta had epilepsy.

33:28.679 --> 33:30.495
Her family couldn't handle it.

33:30.581 --> 33:32.030
So she was sent to an insane asylum.

33:32.166 --> 33:33.398
Oh, wow.

33:33.500 --> 33:36.234
Henrietta spent less than
a year in that insane asylum

33:36.370 --> 33:38.286
before she died at the age of 23.

33:39.606 --> 33:42.290
Nettie's second husband
died a couple years later...

33:42.409 --> 33:44.743
- Geez.
- 1924.

33:44.845 --> 33:48.013
Now, Nettie stayed in the
house for about 10 years

33:48.115 --> 33:49.681
before getting very sick.

33:49.783 --> 33:52.150
In 1932, she died of
a cerebral hemorrhage.

33:52.252 --> 33:54.516
And her wake was actually
held right here, in the house.

33:54.616 --> 33:56.416
Wow.

33:56.518 --> 33:58.752
Chelsea, you think
she's haunting the house.

33:58.837 --> 33:59.953
Yeah.

34:00.055 --> 34:02.756
I've seen her this
clearly in nightmares.

34:02.841 --> 34:07.561
She pins me down and puts her
hands over my mouth and my nose.

34:08.069 --> 34:09.135
Interesting.

34:09.237 --> 34:11.402
So the person

34:11.539 --> 34:13.054
that I'm most concerned about

34:13.174 --> 34:17.409
is a nasty old man that I encountered.

34:17.512 --> 34:21.580
He's very manipulative, very bad.

34:21.716 --> 34:23.101
And he was laughing
at me, and he was like,

34:23.202 --> 34:24.752
"You think you can stop me?

34:24.871 --> 34:26.670
No way. "You're not gonna."

34:26.755 --> 34:30.206
He really likes the room
upstairs to the left.

34:30.310 --> 34:32.576
That's Chelsea's room, just so you know.

34:32.679 --> 34:34.110
Oh.

34:34.197 --> 34:39.800
This guy, comin' into that
room, he was stompin'...

34:39.918 --> 34:44.071
boom, boom, boom... and
just pushing the rage.

34:44.418 --> 34:46.893
I mean, it's overwhelming.

34:46.993 --> 34:49.427
I saw that he was, like,

34:49.529 --> 34:51.396
stomping down on a living woman,

34:51.498 --> 34:55.733
um, like, trying to repress her.

34:56.902 --> 35:01.139
And I got that she
wasn't getting any sleep.

35:01.241 --> 35:04.108
Also making people
paranoid of one another

35:04.194 --> 35:06.461
and causing fights.

35:06.546 --> 35:09.130
What he does is he'll
reach into people's minds,

35:09.249 --> 35:10.582
and he'll dig out the nastiest stuff,

35:10.684 --> 35:13.885
like, the worst issues,
and pop those up.

35:13.987 --> 35:16.638
He can cause serious physical harm.

35:16.756 --> 35:19.140
I feel that he is capable of that.

35:20.660 --> 35:22.227
Sensations that I was getting

35:22.312 --> 35:25.230
was stabbing, cutting,
burning, and choking pains.

35:26.166 --> 35:28.533
Well, pretty much listed

35:28.618 --> 35:30.902
every single thing these
guys are experiencing.

35:31.004 --> 35:34.239
I was having a nightmare,
actually of... about Nettie.

35:34.341 --> 35:37.375
And she was pinning me down.

35:37.477 --> 35:39.377
And I woke up to this
pressure on my chest.

35:39.479 --> 35:40.979
And I was all the way up my wall.

35:41.081 --> 35:43.915
My head was touching the
rafters of my ceiling.

35:44.017 --> 35:46.267
Now, your sister,

35:46.386 --> 35:48.086
when she was six months pregnant,

35:48.188 --> 35:49.420
got pushed down the steps.

35:49.522 --> 35:51.322
Yeah.

35:51.424 --> 35:52.624
That could be him.

35:54.527 --> 35:56.828
Now, her brother sleeps upstairs, too,

35:56.913 --> 35:58.529
and he has a lot of trouble

35:58.665 --> 36:00.315
feeling like he's being choked.

36:00.433 --> 36:01.766
Mm-hmm. The smothering.

36:01.851 --> 36:03.434
- Yep.
- Yeah.

36:03.520 --> 36:05.153
Now, Jonathan, when I interviewed him,

36:05.272 --> 36:07.005
told me a story that
I still don't believe,

36:07.090 --> 36:08.339
to be honest with you.

36:08.425 --> 36:12.610
He'd wake up with
razor blades in his bed.

36:14.147 --> 36:16.381
And I thought he was messin' with me.

36:16.466 --> 36:18.917
But maybe it's this guy
making him hallucinate.

36:19.002 --> 36:21.836
Now, you also said this
guy can make people fight.

36:21.955 --> 36:23.688
Whoa, yeah.

36:23.790 --> 36:26.241
The anger is just at...
just can just tip over

36:26.359 --> 36:28.743
at any slight, little
thing, and we explode.

36:28.862 --> 36:31.246
We never acted like this before.

36:31.364 --> 36:32.747
It's got to be in this house.

36:32.866 --> 36:35.800
This house is gonna tear us apart.

36:38.605 --> 36:42.373
You got any idea who this
[bleep] was when he was alive?

36:42.459 --> 36:44.175
I got that he lived here,

36:44.277 --> 36:46.544
that he had a lot of money and power,

36:46.630 --> 36:49.230
that people really respected
him when he was alive.

36:49.316 --> 36:54.485
He was white, in his late
60s or early 70s when he died.

36:54.587 --> 36:58.222
What I saw when he
was crawling towards me

36:58.325 --> 37:01.192
was that he had his shirt off.

37:01.294 --> 37:03.945
And I think that's how he died.

37:04.064 --> 37:06.564
All right, so this is
a... It may be a long shot,

37:06.666 --> 37:08.116
but Nettie had a son named Russell.

37:08.234 --> 37:10.518
Now, after Nettie died in 1932,

37:10.603 --> 37:12.887
he took over this house
with his wife and six kids.

37:13.006 --> 37:15.089
Now, this guy was a prominent guy.

37:15.208 --> 37:18.092
He was a World War I
vet. He was a dentist.

37:18.211 --> 37:19.594
He was involved in politics.

37:19.713 --> 37:22.430
- Okay.
- What really caught my attention

37:22.549 --> 37:24.449
is when you said he
died with his shirt off.

37:24.551 --> 37:25.750
- Yes.
- Okay.

37:25.852 --> 37:28.553
Now, in 1971, Russell drowned

37:28.655 --> 37:31.306
in Lake Lovelace, which is
less than a mile from here.

37:31.424 --> 37:32.623
Oh.

37:32.759 --> 37:35.760
He was 75 years old according
to this article here.

37:35.862 --> 37:37.562
So I was able to get
a photo of this guy.

37:37.664 --> 37:40.498
The only thing is it
was when he was young.

37:41.508 --> 37:43.023
So, you had seen him as an older man.

37:43.123 --> 37:44.422
I don't know if...

37:44.508 --> 37:47.151
This is what he looked like
when he was in his younger days.

37:47.251 --> 37:49.417
Now, is it possible this
could be the guy you saw?

37:49.519 --> 37:51.620
I had a sketch done of him.

37:51.722 --> 37:53.788
Tell me what you think.

38:01.732 --> 38:03.698
Take a look at who's
terrorizing your family.

38:07.221 --> 38:09.604
This one was the one
I feel like I've seen.

38:09.706 --> 38:12.274
They have a lot of similarities.

38:18.215 --> 38:20.582
So you guys are thinking

38:20.684 --> 38:22.751
you might have ran into this guy, Ditto.

38:22.853 --> 38:23.921
No beard, though.

38:24.595 --> 38:26.228
Yeah. I think it's him.

38:26.297 --> 38:28.364
- What do you think of these?
- You know what?

38:28.466 --> 38:30.900
The more I look at the photo,
if you put a beard on him...

38:31.035 --> 38:32.234
They look a lot...

38:32.370 --> 38:34.403
- ...it's really close.
- Very, very close.

38:34.505 --> 38:38.040
He was a lawyer, well-respected.

38:38.142 --> 38:40.409
So, Chelsea, now you
know who's in your room.

38:44.015 --> 38:45.381
I'm terrified, actually.

38:48.302 --> 38:50.219
All right. So those
shadow people outside,

38:50.304 --> 38:51.871
you think they're his former slaves?

38:51.956 --> 38:53.188
Yeah, I'm thinkin'.

38:53.291 --> 38:55.558
I also think some of
those people out there

38:55.643 --> 38:58.060
are the Native Americans.

38:58.145 --> 39:00.296
Is this guy responsible
for all their infighting,

39:00.398 --> 39:01.797
their animosity towards each other?

39:01.933 --> 39:04.066
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.
- Okay.

39:04.168 --> 39:06.068
I think he's the master manipulator.

39:06.170 --> 39:08.938
He's the one causing hallucinations,

39:09.040 --> 39:11.206
causing people to fight.

39:11.309 --> 39:13.409
I think he's the major problem.

39:13.477 --> 39:17.162
There's got to be some
way I can reach into his...

39:17.248 --> 39:19.081
his world and take care of him.

39:35.927 --> 39:38.078
Well, guys, there's
some good news here.

39:38.178 --> 39:41.045
All the fighting, talk
of divorce, it's not you.

39:41.147 --> 39:43.915
Chelsea, all the stuff
you been going through

39:44.017 --> 39:46.918
upstairs in your bedroom,
you're not goin' nuts.

39:47.020 --> 39:48.820
Now it's time to answer the
question you brought us in for.

39:48.922 --> 39:51.222
Can you live here safely, happily

39:51.324 --> 39:53.691
with your family like
you always intended to do?

39:53.827 --> 39:55.993
Well, for that answer, I'm
gonna turn it over to Amy.

39:59.299 --> 40:04.285
The first order of business
is to remove this guy.

40:04.993 --> 40:07.227
What I would like to see happen is

40:07.329 --> 40:10.263
a black, male medium

40:10.366 --> 40:13.467
needs to come in and remove him.

40:13.569 --> 40:15.001
And this will be by force.

40:15.087 --> 40:17.504
This isn't gonna be
a pleasant experience,

40:17.589 --> 40:19.840
probably for either one, really.

40:19.942 --> 40:22.642
This would then be followed by

40:22.745 --> 40:28.899
that same medium working with
the dead slaves to move them on.

40:29.017 --> 40:33.186
I think that once he's
gotten rid of this jerk,

40:33.322 --> 40:38.425
most, if not all, of the
dead that are still here

40:38.494 --> 40:41.061
will move on themselves.

40:42.231 --> 40:45.332
Then, once all of that's done,

40:45.434 --> 40:49.836
a Native American
medicine man needs to come.

40:49.938 --> 40:53.540
And what needs to be done
then is all of you guys

40:53.642 --> 40:57.043
need to do a peace offering ritual.

40:57.146 --> 41:01.148
This is to let the Native Americans know

41:01.250 --> 41:03.467
that you mean them no harm.

41:03.552 --> 41:06.636
Once that's done, they're
going to back off of you.

41:06.722 --> 41:10.140
Okay, so if they do everything you say,

41:10.225 --> 41:12.125
and one year from now,
we walk back in here,

41:12.261 --> 41:13.543
you think they'll be better?

41:13.629 --> 41:16.496
- Yeah. It'll be great.
- Good. Good. Yeah.

41:16.598 --> 41:20.467
Well, I'm relieved that I don't
have to leave my dream home.

41:20.569 --> 41:23.537
You saved more than a house.

41:23.639 --> 41:25.021
You saved a family.

41:25.107 --> 41:27.140
Yeah.

41:27.242 --> 41:28.792
I'm ready to start fightin' it.

41:28.877 --> 41:30.393
Yeah. He's not gonna win.

41:30.512 --> 41:33.380
There's no way, no way. Unh-unh.

41:33.482 --> 41:36.883
Removing the old,
dead man from this property

41:36.969 --> 41:38.200
won't be easy.
