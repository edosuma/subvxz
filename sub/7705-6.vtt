00:33.067 --> 00:35.067
[music continues]

01:06.734 --> 01:08.700
Hmm, oops.

01:08.702 --> 01:10.602
Well, it can't be perfect.

01:10.604 --> 01:13.005
It's only toothpaste.

01:13.007 --> 01:16.108
Kate, Willie,
you can come out now.

01:16.110 --> 01:17.676
(Kate)
'Be right there.'

01:29.523 --> 01:30.856
Cut, cut, cut.

01:30.858 --> 01:33.125
Uh, could you..
What-what's going on here?

01:33.127 --> 01:35.094
The lyric's too complicated?

01:35.096 --> 01:37.529
Happy anniversary!

01:38.799 --> 01:39.965
Yeah!

01:39.967 --> 01:42.367
Well, ALF, uh,
this is all very nice, but--

01:42.369 --> 01:43.902
Yes, thank you, thank you

01:43.904 --> 01:45.971
but the-the only,
the only problem is--

01:45.973 --> 01:48.740
Problems, shmoblems,
sit down and relax.

01:48.742 --> 01:50.809
The old ALFer's
doing it all tonight.

01:50.811 --> 01:52.211
- ALF.
- The cooking.

01:52.213 --> 01:53.745
The serving, the cleaning.

01:53.747 --> 01:56.448
Of course, once you two
get into the bedroom

01:56.450 --> 01:57.483
you're on your own.

01:57.485 --> 01:59.685
Wink, wink, nudge, nudge.

02:01.555 --> 02:02.554
What's going on?

02:02.556 --> 02:04.890
Oh, looks like the old ALFer

02:04.892 --> 02:07.326
is throwing us
a surprise anniversary party.

02:07.328 --> 02:09.695
Just a little informal nothing.

02:10.431 --> 02:11.897
Lobster pate?

02:13.567 --> 02:14.933
I thought you two
are going out tonight.

02:14.935 --> 02:16.068
What?

02:16.070 --> 02:17.503
Well, uh, ALF,
that's what we were trying

02:17.505 --> 02:18.904
to tell you. We have plans.

02:18.906 --> 02:20.739
We're going out
to see "Nicholas Nickleby."

02:20.741 --> 02:23.809
And, uh, the tickets
were very hard to get.

02:23.811 --> 02:26.278
(Kate)
'We appreciate all the trouble
you've gone to.'

02:26.280 --> 02:30.048
I mean, cutting roses
so they look like radishes.

02:31.085 --> 02:32.484
And making pate.

02:32.486 --> 02:34.119
And very good pate too.

02:34.121 --> 02:35.354
What-what-what's in it?

02:35.356 --> 02:37.589
Uh, let me guess,
there's lobster

02:37.591 --> 02:39.591
there's sour cream

02:39.593 --> 02:42.427
but there's,
there's something else.

02:42.429 --> 02:45.597
- Play-doh.
- That's it.

02:45.599 --> 02:49.701
The fluorescent kind.
I wanted it to be special.

02:49.703 --> 02:52.638
I'm just going
to go brush my teeth.

02:52.640 --> 02:54.773
ALF, if you'd told us
about this earlier

02:54.775 --> 02:57.042
we might have been able
to change our plans, but..

02:57.044 --> 02:58.944
Hey, it's okay.

02:58.946 --> 03:01.880
We'll just celebrate
your anniversary without you.

03:01.882 --> 03:05.551
What do you say, Lynn? It'll
just be you, me and Brian.

03:05.553 --> 03:09.555
Sure. I'm not hungry,
but it sounds like fun.

03:10.291 --> 03:11.390
Ready, mom.

03:11.392 --> 03:13.692
Brian, party tonight.

03:13.694 --> 03:16.295
Be there or be square.

03:16.297 --> 03:19.231
I can't. I'm sleeping over
at Scott's tonight.

03:19.233 --> 03:23.135
His turtle died and we're gonna
flush him down the toilet.

03:23.137 --> 03:26.371
You're gonna skip a party
to flush a turtle?

03:26.373 --> 03:28.073
I get to pull the handle.

03:29.176 --> 03:30.309
[honking]

03:30.311 --> 03:32.311
That's Scott's mom.
I gotta go.

03:32.313 --> 03:34.913
Oh, give me a kiss.
Bye-bye.

03:36.350 --> 03:37.516
(Brian)
Bye.

03:37.518 --> 03:39.151
So, Lynn, looks like

03:39.153 --> 03:40.819
it'll be tea for two.

03:40.821 --> 03:43.422
Hey, mom, if I don't have
to babysit for Brian

03:43.424 --> 03:45.424
then I can go over
to Julie's house, right?

03:45.426 --> 03:46.525
Oh, I guess so.

03:46.527 --> 03:47.893
What's she flushing?

03:48.829 --> 03:49.928
Nothing.

03:49.930 --> 03:51.363
But she just broke up
with her boyfriend

03:51.365 --> 03:53.665
and she needs someone
to eat ice cream with.

03:53.667 --> 03:56.034
Why don't you just
invite her here?

03:56.036 --> 03:58.704
- ALF.
- Oh, yeah, right.

03:58.706 --> 04:00.772
It's the old
"If someone sees the alien

04:00.774 --> 04:02.874
they'll turn him in" excuse.

04:02.876 --> 04:05.811
Well, it's beginning
to wear a little thin.

04:06.847 --> 04:09.414
I'll bring you some ice cream.

04:09.416 --> 04:11.817
Think you can buy me off
with food?

04:13.387 --> 04:14.820
Make it rum raisin.

04:16.190 --> 04:18.857
- I'll see you after the play.
- Okay, honey.

04:18.859 --> 04:20.192
- Bye-bye. Love you.
- Love you too.

04:20.194 --> 04:21.593
Have a great time.

04:21.595 --> 04:24.196
Happy anniversary.

04:24.198 --> 04:27.532
Looks like it's just me
and the Coquilles St. Jacques.

04:27.534 --> 04:28.934
(Kate)
'I'm sorry, ALF.'

04:29.603 --> 04:31.036
I think I got most of it.

04:31.038 --> 04:33.705
My teeth aren't glowing,
are they?

04:34.875 --> 04:37.042
Willie, Lynn went over
to a friend's house.

04:37.044 --> 04:38.377
I guess I didn't think
about whether we should

04:38.379 --> 04:39.911
leave ALF here by himself.

04:39.913 --> 04:42.881
Did I mention the fondue flambe?

04:42.883 --> 04:44.583
I don't see
why we shouldn't trust him.

04:44.585 --> 04:48.086
- And the sizzling fajitas?
- I guess we should stay.

04:48.088 --> 04:50.222
These tickets cost
a $100 a piece.

04:51.425 --> 04:54.726
- He'll be fine.
- You're really going, huh?

04:54.728 --> 04:56.828
Listen, we'll be back
right after the play.

04:56.830 --> 05:00.565
Yeah, eight hours of Dickens?
Take a pillow.

05:00.567 --> 05:03.101
I saw it on PBS.
It's unwatchable.

05:03.103 --> 05:05.437
'And the guy who plays
Wackford Squares'

05:05.439 --> 05:07.906
sounds like he's from Brooklyn!

05:07.908 --> 05:09.608
'And I'll tell
you another thing.'

05:09.610 --> 05:12.744
Guess who Smike's father
turns out to be?

05:12.746 --> 05:15.681
- No.
- Ralph Nickleby. Hah!

05:15.683 --> 05:18.016
'Have a good time.'

05:21.522 --> 05:23.722
[instrumental music]

05:28.195 --> 05:31.096
Yo, Lucky, you busy?

05:31.098 --> 05:33.899
Feel like shooting the breeze?

05:35.803 --> 05:39.004
Probably on the phone
with his friends.

05:40.274 --> 05:42.007
[clicks]

05:42.009 --> 05:43.208
(female on radio)
'I'm Dr. Lory Schrock'

05:43.210 --> 05:44.943
'and we're back
with Jody on the line.'

05:44.945 --> 05:47.779
- 'Are you still there?'
- 'I'm here, Dr. Schrock.'

05:47.781 --> 05:49.147
(Lory)
'Jody, what do you think'

05:49.149 --> 05:51.016
'is the cause
of your loneliness?'

05:51.018 --> 05:52.718
(Jody)
'Well, for one thing'

05:52.720 --> 05:55.053
'Los Angeles seems
so overwhelming.'

05:55.055 --> 05:57.856
'Moving here was like moving
to a different planet.'

05:57.858 --> 05:59.891
I can relate.

05:59.893 --> 06:02.294
(Jody)
'I'm just so afraid
of rejection.'

06:02.296 --> 06:04.196
'People react funny
when they find out'

06:04.198 --> 06:05.530
'I'm not like them.'

06:05.532 --> 06:07.532
I can relate to that too.

06:07.534 --> 06:09.534
(Lory)
'Sometimes you have
to risk being hurt'

06:09.536 --> 06:11.370
'if you want things to change.'

06:11.372 --> 06:15.073
'Put yourself out there, Jody.
You'll find a friend.'

06:15.075 --> 06:17.309
Hey, Jody, you like redheads?

06:17.311 --> 06:19.478
(Jody)
'Thanks for listening,
Dr. Schrock.'

06:19.480 --> 06:20.579
'Sometimes it's important just'

06:20.581 --> 06:22.247
'to have a caring person
to talk--'

06:22.249 --> 06:23.849
(Lory)
'Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Stay on the line a second.'

06:23.851 --> 06:25.250
'We have a pass
to Magic Mountain for you.'

06:25.252 --> 06:28.153
'Our number once again
is 555-4455.'

06:28.155 --> 06:30.655
'We'll be right back
after this message.'

06:30.657 --> 06:32.090
[clicks]

06:32.092 --> 06:35.761
555-4455.

06:43.437 --> 06:45.837
Hello, hi, hi, this is ALF.

06:45.839 --> 06:47.973
Yeah, let me speak to Jody.

06:49.109 --> 06:51.676
Jody, that emotional basket case

06:51.678 --> 06:53.745
that was talking a minute ago.

06:54.381 --> 06:56.047
Why not?

06:56.049 --> 06:58.550
Well, can you give her
my number?

06:58.552 --> 07:02.888
Yeah, it's 555-8531.

07:02.890 --> 07:05.924
Tell her she found a friend.

07:08.695 --> 07:12.197
Found a friend.
Wish I had one.

07:12.199 --> 07:14.533
[phone ringing]

07:14.535 --> 07:16.368
Hello.

07:16.370 --> 07:19.137
Yeah, yeah, this is ALF.

07:19.139 --> 07:20.806
Oh, Jody?

07:20.808 --> 07:22.040
Nice of you to call.

07:22.042 --> 07:24.042
Yeah, hold on a second.

07:29.049 --> 07:32.751
Jody, what's up, babe?

07:32.753 --> 07:35.987
No, no, subtract means
to take away.

07:35.989 --> 07:38.790
Plus means to add.

07:42.563 --> 07:45.797
The shot is up,
and it's good.

07:48.068 --> 07:50.802
[clinks]
Three points.

07:52.139 --> 07:54.172
ALF, in polite society
one doesn't cut

07:54.174 --> 07:56.508
one's toenails
in the living room.

07:56.510 --> 07:57.609
Why not?

07:57.611 --> 07:58.677
Because it causes one

07:58.679 --> 08:00.579
to barf up one's dinner.

08:00.581 --> 08:02.414
Go on.

08:02.416 --> 08:04.316
Just don't do it.

08:04.318 --> 08:05.584
Fine.

08:05.586 --> 08:07.986
[telephone ringing]
Oh, hey, get that, will you?

08:07.988 --> 08:09.921
It's probably Jody.

08:10.991 --> 08:12.858
If it's Jody,
why don't you get it?

08:12.860 --> 08:15.260
What if it isn't?

08:15.262 --> 08:16.995
I'll get it.

08:18.165 --> 08:19.397
Hello?

08:20.601 --> 08:21.800
It's Jody.

08:21.802 --> 08:23.268
- Who?
- Jody.

08:23.270 --> 08:27.272
I know, I just like to hear
the sound of her name.

08:27.274 --> 08:29.608
- Who is it?
- It's Jody!

08:29.610 --> 08:30.675
- Just asked.
- I'm sorry.

08:30.677 --> 08:32.310
It's just this "Jody" business.

08:32.312 --> 08:34.779
Oh, I know. It's getting
a little out of hand.

08:34.781 --> 08:36.014
Mm-hmm.

08:36.016 --> 08:38.149
Yeah, hold on a second,
Jodester.

08:38.151 --> 08:41.653
Could you all step out
on the porch for a few minutes?

08:41.655 --> 08:43.054
I'd like some privacy.

08:43.056 --> 08:45.323
Uh, why don't you use
the kitchen phone?

08:45.325 --> 08:48.460
No problem.
Just hang up when I tell you.

08:54.701 --> 08:56.501
I don't know about this.

08:56.503 --> 08:59.538
This is the third time
they've spoken today.

08:59.540 --> 09:02.674
I think it's nice that ALF
has a friend outside the family.

09:02.676 --> 09:04.376
(ALF)
'Hang up! Now!'

09:04.378 --> 09:07.646
I just wonder where this
relationship is going to lead?

09:07.648 --> 09:09.481
Who says
it has to lead anywhere?

09:09.483 --> 09:11.650
Is ALF gonna get married?

09:11.652 --> 09:13.184
Hmm, no, he's not go..

09:13.186 --> 09:15.520
Why? Have you heard something?

09:15.522 --> 09:16.555
[ALF screaming]

09:16.557 --> 09:18.423
[shattering]
Oops.

09:18.425 --> 09:20.025
(ALF)
'Oh, don't worry
about it, Jodester.'

09:20.027 --> 09:21.693
'It's just a gravy boat.'

09:21.695 --> 09:24.396
'I'll talk to you later.'

09:24.398 --> 09:27.165
'Nobody walk barefoot
in the kitchen.'

09:30.404 --> 09:31.670
How's the Jodester?

09:31.672 --> 09:34.839
Terrific.
We have so much in common.

09:34.841 --> 09:36.875
We both love cats.

09:36.877 --> 09:39.611
Of course, I like mine
with a side of fries.

09:39.613 --> 09:41.012
Ha ha!

09:41.014 --> 09:42.847
[glass shatters]

09:42.849 --> 09:46.351
Oops. Love has made me a klutz.

09:46.353 --> 09:49.254
ALF, you know, we're all
really happy that you found

09:49.256 --> 09:51.089
a friend outside
the family, but--

09:51.091 --> 09:52.857
Yeah, I can't wait to meet her.

09:52.859 --> 09:54.059
- Meet her?
- Mm-hmm.

09:54.061 --> 09:56.695
Didn't I tell you?
We have a date tomorrow.

09:56.697 --> 09:58.296
A date?

09:58.298 --> 10:00.532
ALF, you can't go out
on a date.

10:00.534 --> 10:01.900
Why not?

10:01.902 --> 10:03.768
Have you looked
in a mirror lately?

10:03.770 --> 10:05.103
No, mine's broken.

10:05.105 --> 10:06.871
Oh, by the way,
don't walk barefoot

10:06.873 --> 10:09.107
in the laundry room, either.

10:09.109 --> 10:13.244
ALF, uh, if you go out
with Jody

10:13.246 --> 10:14.713
someone will see you.

10:14.715 --> 10:17.248
No, they won't.
I'm going to Jody's place.

10:17.250 --> 10:19.250
But Jody will see you.

10:19.252 --> 10:22.454
That's where I lucked out.
Jody's blind.

10:22.456 --> 10:25.156
- Blind?
- Blind.

10:25.158 --> 10:28.793
ALF...you can't go out with her.

10:28.795 --> 10:29.995
Because she's blind?

10:29.997 --> 10:32.397
Yeah, mom, because she's blind?

10:32.399 --> 10:35.900
This has nothing to do
with her being sightless.

10:35.902 --> 10:38.003
Say the word, Kate.
She's blind!

10:38.005 --> 10:40.105
Her blindness isn't the problem!

10:40.107 --> 10:41.840
Then what is the problem?

10:41.842 --> 10:45.343
Yeah, mom, what do you have
against the Jodester?

10:45.345 --> 10:47.946
Brian, don't you have
some homework to do?

10:47.948 --> 10:50.081
- It can wait.
- No, it can't.

10:50.083 --> 10:52.584
Yes, mom.

10:52.586 --> 10:55.520
ALF, uh, we-we don't
have anything against Jody.

10:55.522 --> 10:58.089
- Great. Can I borrow the car?
- No.

10:58.091 --> 11:01.092
I won't let Jody drive.

11:01.094 --> 11:03.928
What happens when Jody
starts asking questions?

11:03.930 --> 11:05.363
Like where you came from?

11:05.365 --> 11:07.766
She already knows.
Cincinnati.

11:07.768 --> 11:09.701
- Cincinnati?
- 'Mm-hmm.'

11:09.703 --> 11:10.935
What else did you tell her?

11:10.937 --> 11:12.370
Everything.

11:12.372 --> 11:14.305
I told her about my business.

11:14.307 --> 11:16.808
Wholesale band equipment.

11:16.810 --> 11:18.843
And my two lovely children.

11:18.845 --> 11:21.312
- Your children?
- The twins.

11:21.314 --> 11:24.683
From my brief marriage
to Cathy Rigby.

11:24.685 --> 11:27.485
ALF, I think it was wrong
to lie to her.

11:27.487 --> 11:29.821
I know, but what else
could I do?

11:29.823 --> 11:33.358
But eventually,
Jody's gonna learn the truth.

11:33.360 --> 11:36.528
Not if Cathy Rigby
keeps her mouth shut.

11:36.530 --> 11:39.230
ALF, seeing Jody at all

11:39.232 --> 11:41.132
is much too dangerous.

11:41.134 --> 11:44.803
You know it, and we know it.

11:44.805 --> 11:47.372
So, uh, what you're saying is

11:47.374 --> 11:49.307
I can't have any friends.

11:49.309 --> 11:51.309
ALF, you have lots of friends.

11:51.311 --> 11:53.878
I'm your friend.
Brian's your friend.

11:53.880 --> 11:56.314
I'm your friend.

11:56.316 --> 11:58.817
Uh, see, you have
lots of friends.

11:58.819 --> 12:00.351
Oh, uh, uh, in-including me.

12:00.353 --> 12:05.056
Yeah. Just no friends
outside the family.

12:05.058 --> 12:06.658
[sighs]

12:06.660 --> 12:09.761
If you need me,
I'll be in my room.

12:09.763 --> 12:12.097
Alone again, naturally.

12:12.833 --> 12:15.533
[clatters]

12:15.535 --> 12:18.570
I'd clean it up,
but I'm too depressed.

12:19.673 --> 12:22.307
[instrumental music]

12:30.851 --> 12:34.252
Well, Mr. Ginzburg,
I guess it's just you and me.

12:35.856 --> 12:39.624
What do you wanna do? Sing?

12:39.626 --> 12:42.093
Play charades?

12:42.095 --> 12:43.695
Go to a sock hop?

12:43.697 --> 12:45.597
Ha ha ha!

12:48.235 --> 12:51.770
Oh, no, I've killed
my only friend.

12:52.873 --> 12:56.274
- Hey, ALF.
- Excuse me.

12:56.943 --> 12:58.710
Yes? What?

12:58.712 --> 13:00.712
ALF, how would you like to..

13:00.714 --> 13:02.881
That's my sock.

13:02.883 --> 13:04.382
- Dad.
- Oh, right.

13:04.384 --> 13:06.551
Uh, ALF, how-how would you
like to go outside

13:06.553 --> 13:09.254
and, uh, throw around
the old Frisbee?

13:09.256 --> 13:11.322
- The old what?
- The old Frisbee.

13:11.324 --> 13:13.658
Yeah, here, I-I'll
show you how it goes.

13:15.262 --> 13:17.395
I guess I'm not in the mood.

13:17.397 --> 13:19.297
We're just trying
to cheer you up.

13:19.299 --> 13:22.433
I don't need cheering up.
I'm happy.

13:22.435 --> 13:26.805
I've got my cot,
my washer-dryer combo

13:26.807 --> 13:28.807
and I'm talking to socks.

13:28.809 --> 13:30.175
Okay.

13:30.177 --> 13:32.477
Okay, uh, if you wanna
play though

13:32.479 --> 13:34.112
we'll be,
we'll be right outside.

13:34.114 --> 13:37.649
Fine. Brian, better wear
a face mask.

13:37.651 --> 13:38.817
I'll be right out.

13:39.419 --> 13:41.319
Oh, ALF.

13:43.757 --> 13:45.423
I hate seeing you like this.

13:45.425 --> 13:47.525
I hate to be like this.

13:47.527 --> 13:49.961
I feel like Streaky McIntosh.

13:49.963 --> 13:53.631
- Streaky who?
- McIntosh.

13:53.633 --> 13:55.600
Back on Melmac

13:55.602 --> 13:58.469
we were orbit guards together.

13:58.471 --> 14:01.005
He didn't have
any friends either.

14:01.007 --> 14:03.908
Of course, he was obnoxious.

14:05.212 --> 14:06.778
Am I obnoxious?

14:06.780 --> 14:09.047
No, ALF, you're not.

14:09.049 --> 14:11.282
[belching]
Good.

14:12.285 --> 14:14.319
I'm sure things
will get better.

14:14.321 --> 14:16.287
That's easy for you to say.

14:16.289 --> 14:17.455
You're not the one
who just bought

14:17.457 --> 14:19.791
a one-way ticket
to Lonely Ville.

14:20.560 --> 14:24.162
No...but I do understand.

14:24.164 --> 14:26.130
Oh, do you?

14:26.132 --> 14:27.999
Well..

14:28.001 --> 14:31.135
...I guess it'd be like
me never being able

14:31.137 --> 14:32.971
to leave the house

14:32.973 --> 14:35.640
or, or to see anybody else

14:35.642 --> 14:37.709
for the rest of my life
in this planet.

14:39.579 --> 14:40.879
That's terrible.

14:41.882 --> 14:44.148
Hurts, doesn't it?

14:44.150 --> 14:46.484
I mean, Dr. Schrock says
we should take risks

14:46.486 --> 14:48.820
but, uh, how can I take a risk

14:48.822 --> 14:51.389
when there's no one
to take a risk with?

14:55.729 --> 14:57.228
I'll help you.

14:57.864 --> 14:59.330
You'll what?

14:59.332 --> 15:01.799
I'll help you take that risk.

15:04.004 --> 15:06.204
We've only got three hours.

15:06.206 --> 15:07.939
(ALF)
'Where is the styling mousse?'

15:07.941 --> 15:09.040
Top shelf.

15:09.042 --> 15:10.842
[clatters]

15:11.912 --> 15:14.345
- 'Cologne?'
- Bottom shelf.

15:14.347 --> 15:15.947
[shatters]

15:17.217 --> 15:20.685
- 'Talcum powder?'
- Under the sink.

15:20.687 --> 15:22.587
[shattering]

15:23.723 --> 15:27.625
- 'Mouthwash?'
- In the medicine cabinet.

15:27.627 --> 15:30.028
[shatters]

15:30.030 --> 15:32.664
- 'Mop?'
- Never mind. Let's go.

15:36.036 --> 15:38.102
Nobody walk barefoot
in the bathroom.

15:38.104 --> 15:39.370
Come on, we're gonna be late.

15:39.372 --> 15:41.039
Well, how do I look?

15:41.041 --> 15:42.807
Like a real hunk.

15:42.809 --> 15:44.075
A hunk of what?

15:44.077 --> 15:46.144
Come on, we have to go.

15:46.146 --> 15:48.947
No, really, a hunk of what?

15:52.886 --> 15:55.453
Okay, coast is clear.

15:56.957 --> 15:58.823
Come on.

16:00.160 --> 16:01.392
I thought she lived alone.

16:01.394 --> 16:04.095
How come she has
all these rooms?

16:04.097 --> 16:06.297
This is where Jody lives.

16:08.902 --> 16:11.569
No, I still think I should have
brought her something, you know.

16:11.571 --> 16:15.006
Some flowers, some candy,
a Rambo doll.

16:15.008 --> 16:17.108
ALF, you don't have
to bring her anything.

16:17.110 --> 16:19.911
You mean you gals don't care
about that sort of thing?

16:19.913 --> 16:22.947
Well, we care a lot,
but it's too late.

16:22.949 --> 16:27.185
Maybe not. Lemme see what
Willie's got in this coat?

16:27.187 --> 16:30.154
[screams]
Oh my gosh!
It's somebody's hand!

16:30.156 --> 16:31.789
ALF, it's a glove.

16:31.791 --> 16:33.191
Huh.

16:33.193 --> 16:35.326
I'll be back
at 9 o'clock, sharp.

16:35.328 --> 16:36.694
- Nine, right.
- Okay, sharp.

16:36.696 --> 16:38.196
Sharp, sharp, right.
Nine sharp.

16:38.198 --> 16:39.497
Whatever you do..

16:39.499 --> 16:41.599
...don't let her know
you're an alien.

16:41.601 --> 16:43.334
- Alright already. Okay.
- Okay.

16:43.336 --> 16:46.270
- Okay, bye.
- Alright, bye, bye, bye.

16:46.272 --> 16:48.206
Nine sharp. Not an alien.

16:48.208 --> 16:49.440
Nine sharp. Not an alien.

16:49.442 --> 16:51.109
- 'Who is it?'
- Not-not an alien.

16:51.111 --> 16:53.111
Oh, I mean, oh, it's ALF.

16:53.113 --> 16:54.445
It's me.

16:54.447 --> 16:57.448
ALF, hi. I'm Jody.

16:57.450 --> 17:00.385
'It's a pleasure
to meet you.'

17:00.387 --> 17:03.554
Oh, please,
you don't have to bow.

17:07.560 --> 17:10.461
Hey, nice place you have here.

17:10.463 --> 17:11.796
In case you were wondering.

17:11.798 --> 17:15.299
Thank you.
I decorated it myself.

17:15.301 --> 17:17.368
In case you were wondering.

17:18.471 --> 17:20.505
- Shall we sit down?
- Oh, good idea.

17:20.507 --> 17:22.306
There's a chair
right in front of you.

17:22.308 --> 17:25.376
I wondered what that was.

17:27.580 --> 17:31.315
Oh, I almost forgot.
I made food.

17:31.317 --> 17:35.486
Great. Good friends, good food.

17:35.488 --> 17:37.655
Tonight is kinda special.

17:37.657 --> 17:39.824
Would you like some
shrimp hors d'oeuvres?

17:39.826 --> 17:42.727
- Shrimp or what?
- Hors d'oeuvres.

17:42.729 --> 17:45.396
Hmm, it's a tough choice.

17:45.398 --> 17:47.598
I'll go with the shrimp.

17:47.600 --> 17:50.101
[laughing]
Oh!

17:50.103 --> 17:53.371
I get it, shrimp hor d'oeuvres.

17:53.373 --> 17:55.973
[both laughing]

18:04.184 --> 18:05.283
Cat hairs.

18:05.285 --> 18:08.086
Oh, I'm so embarrassed.

18:08.088 --> 18:10.188
I thought I got them all.

18:10.190 --> 18:11.889
Persian, '78.

18:11.891 --> 18:13.357
[sniffing]

18:13.359 --> 18:15.827
Could be a '79.

18:17.630 --> 18:19.597
You'll probably be covered
with hair

18:19.599 --> 18:20.631
by the time you leave.

18:20.633 --> 18:22.567
Oh, hey, I'm used to it.

18:22.569 --> 18:24.902
Oh, tasty vittles.

18:24.904 --> 18:28.806
Oh, good. Well, I was worried
you wouldn't like it.

18:28.808 --> 18:30.608
Nowadays you don't know
what to make.

18:30.610 --> 18:33.878
I mean, you never know
what people will eat.

18:33.880 --> 18:36.114
'Some people won't eat red meat,
some won't eat sugar.'

18:36.116 --> 18:39.684
Some won't eat fried foods
or dairy products.

18:41.054 --> 18:44.622
Hey, thanks,
they were delicious.

18:45.391 --> 18:47.725
- There you go.
- They were?

18:48.728 --> 18:52.430
Well...I'm glad you
enjoyed them.

18:52.432 --> 18:55.133
Oh, I'm sorry,
did you want some?

18:55.135 --> 18:57.335
Actually I'm too nervous to eat.

18:57.337 --> 18:58.970
I eat when I'm nervous.

18:58.972 --> 19:01.005
- You're nervous too?
- Mm-hmm.

19:01.007 --> 19:04.675
Of course, I also eat
when I'm not nervous.

19:04.677 --> 19:06.577
I eat when I'm depressed.

19:06.579 --> 19:07.612
I eat when I'm bored.

19:07.614 --> 19:09.413
I eat when I'm lonely.

19:09.415 --> 19:10.982
I eat all the time.

19:10.984 --> 19:12.483
I'm a little overweight.

19:12.485 --> 19:14.085
- I'm short.
- I'm blind.

19:14.087 --> 19:15.720
You win.

19:17.123 --> 19:18.656
How about some music?

19:18.658 --> 19:20.124
Oh, the stereo
is to your right.

19:20.126 --> 19:22.293
Thanks, if you hadn't
said anything

19:22.295 --> 19:24.762
I might have played the lamp.

19:25.665 --> 19:26.797
What would you like to hear?

19:26.799 --> 19:28.633
Oh, anything by The Archies

19:28.635 --> 19:31.269
or, uh, The Partridge Family.

19:31.271 --> 19:32.803
I don't have any of those.

19:32.805 --> 19:36.040
Well, then just stick
on anything by The Chipmunks.

19:36.042 --> 19:38.442

21:30.790 --> 21:32.957
I really care about you.

21:32.959 --> 21:35.626
I care about you too, ALF.

21:35.628 --> 21:37.628
And I'm asking you to trust me.

21:39.499 --> 21:41.999
Well, you're asking
an awful lot.

21:42.001 --> 21:43.734
I know I am.

21:43.736 --> 21:46.737
But-but remember
what Dr. Schrock said

21:46.739 --> 21:49.974
"Sometimes you have
to take a chance."

21:49.976 --> 21:53.778
But it seems that I'm taking
a bigger chance than you are.

21:53.780 --> 21:55.479
You have no idea.

21:55.481 --> 21:57.148
(Lynn)
'ALF! ALF!'

21:57.150 --> 21:58.716
Yeah, in a second.

21:59.819 --> 22:03.354
Jody, are you willing
to take a chance on me?

22:05.191 --> 22:07.591
- Yes.
- Good.

22:07.593 --> 22:10.161
Then let me ask you something.

22:10.163 --> 22:11.195
[knocks on door]

22:11.197 --> 22:13.764
ALF, we've got
to leave right now!

22:13.766 --> 22:15.266
It's 9 o'clock.

22:16.502 --> 22:18.302
[sighs]

22:18.304 --> 22:20.171
So, how about it?

22:20.973 --> 22:23.007
Sounds good.

22:23.009 --> 22:25.876
- Goodnight, ALF.
- Goodnight, Jody.

22:25.878 --> 22:28.079
[instrumental music]

22:34.454 --> 22:35.686
[door closes]

22:40.693 --> 22:42.793
[instrumental music]

22:50.069 --> 22:52.370
[exhales]

22:52.372 --> 22:54.638
We made it.

22:54.640 --> 22:56.207
Oh, my gosh,
the bathroom's a mess!

22:57.810 --> 23:00.311
- Hi!
- You're late.

23:00.313 --> 23:03.414
Uh, sorry, we had to make
a little stop along the way.

23:03.416 --> 23:05.683
Yeah, well, we thought
about what you said before

23:05.685 --> 23:07.151
about wanting a friend.

23:07.153 --> 23:08.953
So...here.

23:10.156 --> 23:12.056
This is Sparky.

23:12.058 --> 23:14.658
You got me a rat. Nice gesture.

23:14.660 --> 23:15.993
It's a hamster.

23:15.995 --> 23:17.828
Same genus, different species.

23:17.830 --> 23:19.830
They taste exactly alike.

23:20.767 --> 23:22.400
[sniffing]

23:22.402 --> 23:23.834
I'll take it back tomorrow.

23:23.836 --> 23:25.336
[sniffing]

23:25.338 --> 23:27.004
Tonight.

23:27.006 --> 23:29.106
Come on, Brian,
let's get you to bed.

23:29.108 --> 23:30.775
- Let's go.
- Hi, everybody.

23:30.777 --> 23:32.777
The bathroom's clean.

23:32.779 --> 23:34.011
Great.

23:36.682 --> 23:38.215
You know, Lynn..

23:38.217 --> 23:40.251
...I'll never forget
what you've done for me tonight.

23:40.253 --> 23:43.754
[chuckles]
Well, the important thing is,
that it's over.

23:43.756 --> 23:46.257
Yeah, at least until Saturday.

23:48.394 --> 23:50.628
Saturday?

23:50.630 --> 23:52.096
Guess who's coming to dinner?

24:00.206 --> 24:01.505
[theme music]

24:26.666 --> 24:28.866
[ALF laughing]
