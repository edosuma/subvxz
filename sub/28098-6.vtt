WEBVTT

00:02.053 --> 00:04.104
Previously on "The Enemy Within"...

00:04.106 --> 00:06.723
You tried to access classified
intelligence on Mikhail Tal.

00:06.725 --> 00:10.110
I didn't try to access
those files... Anna Cruz did.

00:10.112 --> 00:12.195
- And why would she do that?
- Because she's a mole.

00:12.220 --> 00:14.388
She clawed her way into this building,

00:14.390 --> 00:16.388
and she clawed her way into you.

00:18.580 --> 00:20.647
Drop the gun, Keaton. Now!

00:20.649 --> 00:22.048
Anna, I can protect you.

00:22.050 --> 00:24.417
- I could never trust you.
- Yes, you can.

00:24.419 --> 00:25.918
I'll keep my word.

00:25.920 --> 00:27.692
I need you to pu that gun down.

00:33.662 --> 00:36.137
- Are you proud, Agent Keaton?
- Tal.

00:36.139 --> 00:37.530
You saw Anna for what she was

00:37.532 --> 00:40.166
but not before she gave me what I wanted.

00:40.168 --> 00:42.385
You had someone on the inside.

00:42.860 --> 00:44.003
That ended tonight.

00:44.005 --> 00:45.972
What makes you think she's the only one?

00:47.000 --> 00:53.074

01:10.921 --> 01:12.354
How are you feeling after Saturday?

01:12.356 --> 01:14.923
- A little tight.
- Ha. Ten miles will do that.

01:14.925 --> 01:16.225
You should've seen me the day after.

01:16.227 --> 01:17.626
I could barely walk when I woke up.

01:17.628 --> 01:18.927
Today will be nice and easy.

01:18.929 --> 01:21.396
4 miles, 9-minute pace. You ready?

01:21.398 --> 01:23.131
Yeah.

01:23.133 --> 01:25.133
Hey, when you headed back to D.C. anyway?

01:25.135 --> 01:27.636
Uh, Wednesday... I've got to
get back to the office.

01:27.638 --> 01:30.305
Hold on a sec. I've got to tie my toe.

01:53.597 --> 01:56.131
Daniel's doing cleanup
in a Colntel Division.

01:58.060 --> 02:00.385
They're going to sweep the
interrogation room for bugs,

02:00.387 --> 02:03.105
so your meeting with your
daughter's gonna be here today.

02:03.649 --> 02:04.856
In my cell?

02:05.275 --> 02:06.658
Supervised.

02:08.695 --> 02:09.794
If you wanna wait until
the techs are done...

02:09.797 --> 02:11.596
No, I want to see her.

02:15.118 --> 02:16.335
You look like hell, Keaton.

02:20.582 --> 02:21.917
I turned her.

02:23.585 --> 02:25.363
Anna Cruz, before she was shot.

02:27.214 --> 02:29.067
I turned her.

02:29.466 --> 02:31.302
I could see it in her eyes.

02:59.056 --> 03:00.522
How's the cleanup coming?

03:00.524 --> 03:02.524
I'd call it a thorough and complete purge

03:02.526 --> 03:03.993
of a lot of hard work.

03:03.995 --> 03:05.823
We have to assume that
everything that Anna Cruz

03:05.825 --> 03:08.264
had access to has been compromised.

03:08.266 --> 03:10.099
Keaton, I have something urgent.

03:10.101 --> 03:12.057
I've been monitoring the mesh network

03:12.059 --> 03:14.141
that Tal and his operatives
use to communicate.

03:14.143 --> 03:15.838
Look at this.

03:15.840 --> 03:17.442
There's been an uptick.

03:17.442 --> 03:18.598
The chatter on the network

03:18.600 --> 03:20.309
jumped to more than 1000% this morning.

03:20.311 --> 03:23.045
I'd say that's a whole lot
more than an uptick.

03:24.455 --> 03:26.022
What is that?

03:27.619 --> 03:29.151
Turn that up!

03:29.153 --> 03:30.753
We are now getting reports
of eight killed

03:30.755 --> 03:32.421
and countless more victims

03:32.423 --> 03:34.173
in what local police are calling

03:34.175 --> 03:36.676
one of the worst acts of
violence in city history.

03:36.931 --> 03:39.198
There is no information yet
on who is responsible

03:39.200 --> 03:41.500
or the motivations behind the bombing.

03:41.502 --> 03:44.720
Authorities are saying whoever
carried out this heinous act

03:44.722 --> 03:46.855
is still at large.

03:46.857 --> 03:48.323
We will continue to monitor...

03:48.325 --> 03:49.474
This is Tal.

03:51.560 --> 03:55.650
Synced & corrected by -robtor-
www.addic7ed.com

03:57.272 --> 03:58.805
What do you have for me?

03:58.807 --> 04:00.740
Dozens of Tal's operatives
were communicating

04:00.742 --> 04:02.776
on the mesh network minutes
before the bombing.

04:02.778 --> 04:04.077
The problem is there's no way to find out

04:04.079 --> 04:05.679
which one actually
carried out the attack,

04:05.681 --> 04:07.380
but I had an idea.

04:07.382 --> 04:09.583
I analyzed the cell traffic
from the past few days

04:09.585 --> 04:11.785
and I found this.

04:11.787 --> 04:15.021
This user is at the center of
the communication cluster

04:15.023 --> 04:17.257
and everyone on the network
contacted him.

04:17.259 --> 04:18.692
You think he was the mastermind?

04:18.694 --> 04:21.438
No, because everyone
contacted him only once.

04:21.495 --> 04:23.096
They were conducting radio checks.

04:23.098 --> 04:24.564
Exactly. He's not the mastermind.

04:24.566 --> 04:26.700
He's Tal's communication expert.

04:26.702 --> 04:31.985
Keaton, when we get him, we can
unlock the entire network.

04:31.987 --> 04:34.883
We can find the bomber
and we can find Tal.

04:45.242 --> 04:46.567
So are we going after this guy or what?

04:46.569 --> 04:48.107
Yeah, Keaton's on his way down right now.

04:48.109 --> 04:50.434
Eight people killed in
a bombing in broad daylight.

04:50.436 --> 04:51.487
That's awful.

04:51.489 --> 04:53.348
- You see the photos?
- Mm-hmm.

04:53.350 --> 04:55.404
Don't worry, we're gonna
get whoever did this.

04:56.073 --> 04:57.873
- What up, boss?
- That bomb went off

04:57.875 --> 04:59.225
in New Jersey, but Kate tracked down

04:59.227 --> 05:01.277
Tal's communications expert here in D.C.

05:01.279 --> 05:03.312
Now we get him, we got
a shot at getting everybody

05:03.314 --> 05:04.447
involved, including Tal.

05:04.449 --> 05:05.848
How'd she track him down?

05:05.850 --> 05:08.083
- Using this.
- Stingray signal tracker.

05:14.158 --> 05:16.492
Out target's just ten miles
away from here.

05:16.494 --> 05:17.827
Kate said that person talked

05:17.829 --> 05:19.795
to everybody that was involved
in the bombing.

05:19.797 --> 05:21.991
We got to bring him in,
we got to bring him in alive.

05:21.993 --> 05:23.532
Tal's actions aren't random.

05:23.534 --> 05:25.501
Let's go figure out why
he attacked that pier. Ready?

05:25.503 --> 05:27.319
Let's roll.

05:33.708 --> 05:35.674
Keaton, I tracked
the suspect's cell phone

05:35.676 --> 05:38.110
to a Telecom building outside of D.C.

05:45.186 --> 05:47.253
The suspect's definitely inside.

05:47.255 --> 05:49.521
Track him from here. Let us
know if he moves positions.

05:49.523 --> 05:51.924
We're going to sweep the
interior, go floor by floor.

05:51.926 --> 05:53.409
Remember, we need this guy alive.

05:53.411 --> 05:54.760
You got it.

06:02.570 --> 06:04.920
Keaton, I got something!

06:04.922 --> 06:07.139
I think the target's on the roof.

06:07.141 --> 06:10.020
Copy that. We're headed there now.

06:37.004 --> 06:38.887
Keaton, 12:00.

06:45.294 --> 06:47.978
He's heading for the
south side of the building.

06:53.687 --> 06:55.820
This way!

07:06.209 --> 07:08.910
Hey, stop! Get down! Get down!

07:08.935 --> 07:10.901
Get down! Get down!

07:13.183 --> 07:14.416
Get down!

07:15.702 --> 07:17.003
Stop!

07:17.588 --> 07:18.854
Don't come any closer.

07:18.856 --> 07:20.298
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

07:21.800 --> 07:23.692
Holstering the gun.

07:24.428 --> 07:25.894
Just take it easy.

07:25.896 --> 07:28.029
- Stay back or I'll jump!
- Just... just take it easy.

07:28.031 --> 07:29.598
Take it easy.

07:31.568 --> 07:33.335
It's going to be okay.

07:33.337 --> 07:34.770
I mean it. I'll jump!

07:34.772 --> 07:36.621
Okay, just take it easy.

07:43.213 --> 07:44.479
No, let me go!

07:44.481 --> 07:46.648
- You're under arrest.
- Let me go!

07:47.993 --> 07:49.918
Target acquired.

07:50.537 --> 07:51.753
Nice catch, boss.

08:05.652 --> 08:07.262
What do you think?

08:10.357 --> 08:12.023
It's so...

08:14.461 --> 08:18.530
Small and... dark.

08:20.234 --> 08:22.851
- What do you really think?
- Sorry.

08:24.471 --> 08:26.114
It's just so...

08:28.075 --> 08:30.008
Empty.

08:30.344 --> 08:32.477
Yeah.

08:33.780 --> 08:36.248
Well, it's a lot better
than where I used to be.

08:40.503 --> 08:42.821
What you do all day?

08:42.823 --> 08:47.926
I work... and I have my memories of you.

08:49.672 --> 08:54.748
But there's no TV or books or music.

08:54.750 --> 08:57.536
There is music. There's
music for one hour a week.

09:03.435 --> 09:05.110
What are you listening to?

09:05.820 --> 09:07.345
Who is it?

09:07.922 --> 09:09.389
One Direction?

09:09.391 --> 09:10.590
No.

09:10.992 --> 09:13.292
Sorry. Who do you like?

09:14.621 --> 09:17.397
Right now, The Doors.

09:19.809 --> 09:23.143
I loved Jim Morrison when I was your age.

09:24.005 --> 09:25.079
I must've listened to

09:25.081 --> 09:26.981
the Live at the Hollywood Bowl
a hundred times.

09:26.983 --> 09:29.183
And Grandpa hated it
because he loved Jazz.

09:29.185 --> 09:31.252
- Yeah.
- You've told me the story.

09:31.254 --> 09:34.722
- Are you still playing piano?
- No.

09:34.724 --> 09:36.123
Hannah, you quit?

09:36.125 --> 09:37.658
Just kidding, Mom.

09:37.660 --> 09:39.643
I still have lessons twice a week.

09:40.897 --> 09:45.099
I even have culmination
at the music school tonight.

09:49.939 --> 09:51.839
I wish you could go.

09:53.943 --> 09:55.509
Let's see what you're playing.

10:01.501 --> 10:02.794
Yeah.

10:04.087 --> 10:05.512
It probably won't be possible.

10:10.152 --> 10:13.346
Don't they owe you for helping them?

10:15.572 --> 10:16.638
Um, sort of,

10:16.640 --> 10:20.208
but that's not really what
I asked for in return.

10:21.578 --> 10:23.111
What did you ask for?

10:27.751 --> 10:29.394
You.

10:39.596 --> 10:42.263
- Can I, um...
- What?

10:45.211 --> 10:46.629
Can I hold...

10:47.545 --> 10:48.711
hold you?

10:51.449 --> 10:52.581
Are we allowed?

10:52.583 --> 10:54.450
I don't care.

11:08.610 --> 11:10.153
You still fit.

11:13.464 --> 11:15.764
- Is this...
- What? What?

11:15.766 --> 11:18.584
Is this always how it's going to be?

11:18.586 --> 11:20.402
We're never alone.

11:20.404 --> 11:23.539
We can't talk about anything private.

11:26.377 --> 11:28.143
Like what?

11:31.299 --> 11:32.675
Like what?

11:33.968 --> 11:35.584
Is something wrong?

11:36.820 --> 11:39.015
Hannah, you can talk to me.

11:43.369 --> 11:46.003
There's just things I want to tell you,

11:46.005 --> 11:47.538
- and I...
- Shepherd.

11:47.540 --> 11:49.940
- We need you upstairs now.
- What, I still have time...

11:49.942 --> 11:51.945
I'm sorry. We need you
upstairs now. It's urgent.

12:01.354 --> 12:03.832
I was in the middle
of something important.

12:04.524 --> 12:06.891
What difference would
five minutes have made?

12:06.893 --> 12:08.025
Eight people were just killed

12:08.027 --> 12:09.694
in a bomb attack in New Jersey.

12:09.963 --> 12:11.228
Tal is behind that.

12:11.923 --> 12:13.798
I'm sorry, but I need your help.

12:13.800 --> 12:15.433
Do you know the target?

12:15.435 --> 12:17.284
No, but we captured
his communications expert.

12:17.286 --> 12:18.803
Daniel is about to question him now.

12:18.805 --> 12:20.104
You know how Tal recruits his people.

12:20.106 --> 12:21.605
Same way you've helped us with Cruz,

12:21.607 --> 12:22.840
you're gonna help us with him.

12:29.916 --> 12:31.365
We can skip the introductions

12:31.367 --> 12:32.850
because we already know
everything about you.

12:32.852 --> 12:35.069
I need the names of everyone
involved in the bombing.

12:35.071 --> 12:36.136
I don't know what you're talking about.

12:36.138 --> 12:39.023
Don't. Don't lie to me.

12:43.896 --> 12:45.596
You built the communications network

12:45.598 --> 12:47.458
used to plan this attack.

12:48.334 --> 12:50.100
That doesn't just make you complicit.

12:50.353 --> 12:51.453
It makes you responsible.

12:51.455 --> 12:53.254
I repair telephone lines.

12:53.631 --> 12:56.330
I know nothing of mesh network.

12:56.332 --> 12:59.721
Then why are you wanted in Egypt...

13:00.764 --> 13:02.864
for building the communications network

13:02.866 --> 13:05.200
used by the Arab Spring protestors?

13:10.356 --> 13:12.901
Like I'm saying, we already
know everything about you.

13:13.943 --> 13:17.779
Why don't you just save us
all some time and tell me...

13:19.282 --> 13:21.117
Where can I find the bomber?

13:23.411 --> 13:25.186
Your guess is as good as mine.

13:36.482 --> 13:38.115
He's not gonna be an easy break.

13:38.117 --> 13:39.516
Any second now,

13:39.518 --> 13:41.118
Tal can discover
that you've captured him,

13:41.120 --> 13:43.087
alert his operatives.

13:43.723 --> 13:45.155
Clock is ticking, Keaton.

13:48.911 --> 13:50.711
Bragg, tell me you got something.

13:50.713 --> 13:53.113
Yeah, the explosive materials
used in the bomb

13:53.115 --> 13:55.515
are ammonium nitrate and diesel fuel.

13:55.517 --> 13:57.651
Blasting cap was set to detonate,

13:57.653 --> 13:59.753
and the casing was a propane tank

13:59.755 --> 14:02.256
- hidden inside of a backpack.
- Any leads on the origin?

14:02.823 --> 14:04.923
Yeah, the bomb techs
identified the ammonium.

14:04.925 --> 14:06.625
It looks like it came from
a fertilizer plant

14:06.627 --> 14:08.104
in Richmond, Virginia.

14:08.106 --> 14:09.945
Jackie and I are gonna head
down there right now.

14:09.947 --> 14:12.564
Good work. Keep me updated.

14:14.968 --> 14:17.869
Eight people are dead.
You know what that means?

14:17.871 --> 14:20.677
Eight back-to-back life sentences.

14:21.775 --> 14:23.221
That's what you're looking at.

14:25.412 --> 14:27.016
You know, Sam...

14:29.183 --> 14:30.478
Maybe I can help you.

14:32.386 --> 14:34.691
Maybe I can talk to the prosecutor...

14:35.355 --> 14:37.068
see if we can work a deal.

14:38.236 --> 14:40.989
You mean the same deal
you offered Viktor Nemec?

14:41.762 --> 14:43.895
He died in your custody.

14:43.897 --> 14:46.452
I'm sorry, Agent Zain,

14:47.912 --> 14:49.868
but I think I'll take my chances.

14:56.729 --> 14:58.829
Why didn't you report
the theft to the FBI?

14:58.831 --> 15:01.465
Our tanks registered at
full-capacity the whole time.

15:01.467 --> 15:03.601
Whoever, uh, stole the ammonium nitrate

15:03.603 --> 15:04.902
was sophisticated enough

15:04.904 --> 15:07.371
to hack our computer
monitoring system too.

15:07.373 --> 15:09.056
We had to hand measure just to figure out

15:09.058 --> 15:11.442
- how much was missing.
- Well, how much did they take?

15:11.444 --> 15:12.977
Close to a 1,000 pounds.

15:13.454 --> 15:15.020
But if somebody's gonna use it,
they're gonna...

15:15.022 --> 15:17.256
- they're gonna do it soon.
- Why is that?

15:17.258 --> 15:20.109
The chemical plant is missing
1,000 pounds of fertilizer,

15:20.111 --> 15:22.327
but the bomb today only used about 100.

15:22.329 --> 15:24.991
That's 900 pound of
explosives unaccounted for.

15:25.399 --> 15:27.099
There's more bombs out there.

15:38.758 --> 15:40.208
900 pounds of ammonium
nitrate is enough to

15:40.210 --> 15:41.559
bring down a building.

15:41.805 --> 15:43.138
The only way we castop that
form happening

15:43.140 --> 15:44.189
is sitting in that room right now.

15:44.191 --> 15:46.026
Daniel, we need results now.

15:46.028 --> 15:47.978
He rejected a deal,
but he's smart and engaged,

15:48.003 --> 15:49.736
which means there's a way in,
an incentive.

15:49.738 --> 15:51.404
You don't have time for this.

15:51.909 --> 15:53.376
I've worked in Cairo.

15:53.378 --> 15:55.030
I have contacts that can
extradite Sam to a prison

15:55.032 --> 15:58.082
that is very good at
convincing people to talk.

15:58.107 --> 15:59.723
You mean rendition and torture?

15:59.748 --> 16:01.298
Not everyone can be as scrupulous

16:01.300 --> 16:02.733
as the FBI, Agent Zain.

16:02.735 --> 16:05.085
How'd that work out for you
in finding Bin Laden?

16:05.087 --> 16:07.621
The CIA waterboarded
his right-hand man 183 times,

16:07.623 --> 16:09.306
and it still took you
ten years to find him?

16:09.308 --> 16:10.440
All right, let's stay focused.

16:10.442 --> 16:11.842
Daniel, I need you to stay on Sam.

16:11.844 --> 16:13.420
You figure out what incentives
will appeal to him,

16:13.422 --> 16:14.466
but do it quickly.

16:14.468 --> 16:16.257
- We're running out of time.
- You need to do more.

16:16.282 --> 16:18.644
My contacts from Egypt
will give you information.

16:18.751 --> 16:21.184
They will reveal to you his weak points.

16:21.186 --> 16:22.252
What contacts?

16:22.254 --> 16:23.487
I worked with an Egyptian

16:23.489 --> 16:26.423
intelligence officer named Gamal.

16:26.425 --> 16:29.159
Before I was arrested, he was
posted at the Egyptian embassy

16:29.161 --> 16:30.961
in D.C. under diplomatic cover.

16:30.963 --> 16:32.629
So if he's still in the United States

16:32.631 --> 16:34.831
and you can get him here,

16:35.620 --> 16:37.987
I guarantee you he will have
information that will help out.

16:37.989 --> 16:39.789
Okay, I'll call him. I'll bring him in.

16:39.791 --> 16:41.858
Uh, you're not... not understanding.

16:41.860 --> 16:43.726
It will take more than
a phone call to get him here.

16:43.728 --> 16:45.050
Why is that?

16:45.052 --> 16:47.146
Well, let's just say that
Gamal and I had a falling out

16:47.148 --> 16:49.999
and he's not going to work for
the U.S. government.

16:50.001 --> 16:51.716
So if you want to bring him here,

16:51.718 --> 16:53.788
then you will have to black bag him.

16:55.941 --> 16:58.501
No, I'm not ready to do that.

17:07.586 --> 17:10.435
We don't have much time,
so let's cut to the chase

17:10.438 --> 17:12.121
and talk about the people you care about.

17:12.123 --> 17:13.656
Who's this?

17:18.376 --> 17:20.609
You know who she is?

17:29.840 --> 17:31.523
Here.

17:44.297 --> 17:46.238
You look happy together.

17:46.716 --> 17:48.840
She must've meant a lot to you.

17:51.044 --> 17:54.679
Nadia was just a protestor
during the Arab Spring.

17:54.681 --> 17:57.198
No, no, no. no.
She wasn't just a protestor.

17:57.200 --> 17:58.817
She was a leader of the protest.

17:58.819 --> 18:00.552
We know everything about her.

18:03.607 --> 18:05.440
She had endless courage.

18:05.943 --> 18:08.760
You know, I watched some
of the coverage at the time.

18:10.030 --> 18:11.824
She must've made you proud.

18:12.599 --> 18:14.785
What do you know about pride?

18:16.162 --> 18:18.904
I don't know, um... you tell me.

18:19.457 --> 18:20.605
What don't I know?

18:21.042 --> 18:24.518
There were thousands of us
in Tahrir Square.

18:27.748 --> 18:31.283
For the first time in my life,
I was proud.

18:33.320 --> 18:37.055
Proud to be here amongst the people.

18:37.057 --> 18:40.659
Proud to be a part of
something bigger than myself.

18:40.661 --> 18:41.979
Proud...

18:43.689 --> 18:45.063
proud to be Egyptian.

18:47.068 --> 18:50.269
Afterwards, Nadia and I returned home.

18:55.115 --> 18:57.609
To celebrate, filled with hope.

19:03.225 --> 19:07.110
When we returned that night,
the Mukhabarat were waiting.

19:19.625 --> 19:23.443
During our escape, we were separated.

19:24.263 --> 19:25.729
Sam!

19:25.731 --> 19:27.063
Nadia!

19:27.065 --> 19:28.265
- Sam!
- Nadia!

19:28.267 --> 19:29.966
- No!
- Nadia!

19:29.968 --> 19:32.002
Nadia!

19:46.421 --> 19:49.052
I was able to escape, but Nadia...

19:52.486 --> 19:53.986
She was captured.

19:54.263 --> 19:55.635
No!

19:55.637 --> 19:58.304
No, no, no!

19:58.306 --> 19:59.906
No, no!

20:02.377 --> 20:04.060
Imprisoned.

20:06.940 --> 20:08.357
Tortured.

20:16.696 --> 20:18.457
My Nadia...

20:23.834 --> 20:26.699
They beat her to death.

20:30.637 --> 20:35.173
So please, don't lecture me about pride.

20:37.970 --> 20:39.545
I was a fool.

20:41.600 --> 20:42.815
We all were.

20:45.478 --> 20:46.886
I'm sorry, Sam.

20:48.481 --> 20:49.956
How can you be sorry?

20:51.192 --> 20:53.793
Your government betrayed us.

20:54.862 --> 20:58.065
Where was your CIA after the elections?

20:58.090 --> 21:00.743
Was that when you started
working for Tal?

21:01.460 --> 21:03.427
To seek revenge against America?

21:03.429 --> 21:05.696
Revenge, yes.

21:07.199 --> 21:09.418
But not against America.

21:09.952 --> 21:12.986
Against the man who killed Nadia.

21:15.305 --> 21:18.673
After her death, I was
approached by a Serbian soldier

21:18.675 --> 21:19.841
who worked for Tal.

21:19.843 --> 21:22.110
He had a scar on his hand.

21:23.513 --> 21:28.233
He said he could give me money
and passage to America,

21:28.235 --> 21:30.735
and he said he could give me
the name of the man

21:30.737 --> 21:32.191
that killed Nadia.

21:33.359 --> 21:36.157
All I had to do was wait
until I was called on.

21:37.279 --> 21:40.662
Yes, I built Tal's
communications network,

21:40.664 --> 21:43.197
but I killed no one.

21:43.686 --> 21:48.322
No, you can't hide behind
some veil of ignorance, Sam.

21:48.324 --> 21:52.260
Eight people died today
because of your network.

21:52.670 --> 21:54.896
But you can still do some good.

21:55.136 --> 21:56.502
You can help us stop the bomber.

21:56.504 --> 21:57.953
- No.
- Stop protecting

21:57.955 --> 21:59.538
- these killers.
- I said no!

21:59.540 --> 22:02.341
If I take a deal that benefits
me without justice for Nadia,

22:02.343 --> 22:04.343
I might as well spit on her grave.

22:04.345 --> 22:06.245
And if another bomb goes off,
innocent people will die

22:06.247 --> 22:08.097
and their blood?
It'll be on your hands, Sam.

22:08.099 --> 22:11.105
Must be so easy for you
to stand there in judgment.

22:11.869 --> 22:14.119
But you know what Nadia taught me?

22:14.121 --> 22:15.860
Conviction.

22:16.891 --> 22:19.324
I want a name, Agent Zain.

22:19.349 --> 22:21.699
I want the name
of the man that killed Nadia.

22:21.701 --> 22:23.251
Tell me that and
I will tell you everything.

22:23.253 --> 22:25.637
Otherwise, I have nothing more to say.

22:31.211 --> 22:33.461
He wants a name, Agent Keaton.

22:34.948 --> 22:36.390
Let's get him one.

22:45.926 --> 22:49.344
I've got eyes on Gamal here.
Everybody take positions.

22:49.810 --> 22:50.895
Ready.

22:52.332 --> 22:54.666
I'm heading out on foot now.

23:13.934 --> 23:15.567
He's on the run! Move in now!

23:15.569 --> 23:16.801
I'm on him.

23:20.240 --> 23:22.574
Bragg, he's heading your way.

23:28.448 --> 23:30.181
Hands behind your back.

23:33.220 --> 23:35.353
You don't know what you're doing.

23:35.355 --> 23:37.122
Let's go.

23:46.021 --> 23:47.368
Why am I here?

23:48.494 --> 23:50.658
Under whose authority was I detained?

23:57.200 --> 23:58.333
Mine.

24:18.065 --> 24:19.387
It's been a long time.

24:30.345 --> 24:32.204
We have a lot to catch up on.

24:33.430 --> 24:35.380
I apologize for my pick-up service,

24:35.382 --> 24:38.049
but I was pretty sure you
wouldn't come willingly,

24:38.051 --> 24:41.386
- considering...
- Considering one day we were allies

24:41.388 --> 24:43.221
helping each other capture terrorists

24:43.223 --> 24:45.307
and the next you're helping
to overthrow my government?

24:45.309 --> 24:47.392
If your government had been
a little less corrupt,

24:47.394 --> 24:49.144
perhaps they could have avoided
a revolution.

24:49.146 --> 24:51.313
Why am I here, Shepherd?

24:53.617 --> 24:55.400
I need a name.

24:55.402 --> 24:57.953
I need the name of one of your
colleagues who killed a student

24:57.955 --> 25:00.232
who was involved
in the Arab Spring protests.

25:00.741 --> 25:03.736
Her name was Nadia. Nadia Salah.

25:06.580 --> 25:09.664
She wasn't just a student.
She was also a leader.

25:11.084 --> 25:12.703
Why should I help you?

25:15.331 --> 25:18.590
What do you think Tal would do to you

25:18.592 --> 25:21.092
and your family if he knew
that you were cooperating

25:21.094 --> 25:23.428
with the U.S. government?

25:23.430 --> 25:25.507
I'm not cooperating with you.

25:26.099 --> 25:27.849
I want to show you something.

25:27.851 --> 25:31.019
But you might find it disturbing.

25:42.316 --> 25:43.734
There's nothing here.

25:44.368 --> 25:45.819
No, not yet.

25:46.286 --> 25:50.538
But... imagine that there were.

25:50.540 --> 25:52.624
Imagine that there was
a story written about

25:52.626 --> 25:54.509
how you gave crucial
information to the FBI

25:54.511 --> 25:58.129
that disrupted an attack
being planned by Mikhail Tal.

25:58.131 --> 26:01.466
Imagine what he would do to you.

26:01.468 --> 26:03.468
Why would Tal believe that?

26:05.055 --> 26:06.924
Please, Gamal,

26:07.307 --> 26:08.640
you've seen me manipulate

26:08.642 --> 26:11.309
diplomats, oligarchs, heads of state.

26:11.311 --> 26:13.862
Do you really think that
this would be so difficult?

26:13.864 --> 26:16.531
Besides, Tal doesn't have
to believe that it's true.

26:16.533 --> 26:18.727
He only has to believe that it might be.

26:21.321 --> 26:24.656
Do you remember what we told Abu Rasha

26:24.658 --> 26:27.152
when we captured him down in Luxor?

26:27.711 --> 26:31.079
That we'd tell his brothers he was a rat.

26:32.332 --> 26:36.718
You and I, we've both
used threats before.

26:38.922 --> 26:41.125
Doesn't mean they don't work.

26:41.758 --> 26:45.393
I've been hunting terrorists
for 30 years, Shepherd.

26:45.395 --> 26:49.681
There's a thousand men
who want me and my family dead.

26:49.683 --> 26:51.677
But I realize now...

26:52.269 --> 26:55.186
for every man we took off the street,

26:55.188 --> 26:57.766
we put two more back on.

27:00.360 --> 27:02.146
If you want my help...

27:03.864 --> 27:07.151
you're going to have to do more
than make hollow threats.

27:10.203 --> 27:12.156
How old is your son now?

27:12.873 --> 27:14.539
15.

27:15.592 --> 27:17.745
It's about the same age as my daughter.

27:19.096 --> 27:21.623
You and me, old spies, we like to...

27:22.382 --> 27:24.432
fool ourselves into believing
that we're immune

27:24.434 --> 27:26.634
to the violence that
we enact on each other.

27:27.171 --> 27:28.839
This is true.

27:29.306 --> 27:31.556
Do you remember why it is
we said we got into this job

27:31.558 --> 27:32.801
in the first place?

27:33.226 --> 27:35.512
- We both love our countries.
- Countries.

27:36.229 --> 27:39.280
And a country is just
a collection of families.

27:40.233 --> 27:44.486
Earlier today,
eight families lost someone,

27:44.488 --> 27:47.989
and any minute, many, many,
many more will.

27:47.991 --> 27:49.491
I need a name, Gamal.

27:49.493 --> 27:51.459
I need a name to protect my family

27:51.461 --> 27:54.829
and your family
and a collection of families.

27:58.168 --> 27:59.870
You do this for me,

28:01.171 --> 28:03.707
and when those men come
seeking revenge from you...

28:04.958 --> 28:08.476
I will be there and so will the FBI.

28:10.013 --> 28:11.840
That's not a threat.

28:16.653 --> 28:18.686
Who's this?

28:18.688 --> 28:20.265
Anwar Egoyan.

28:21.525 --> 28:24.269
He's a secret policeman
with Egypt's Mukhabarat.

28:25.445 --> 28:27.272
He's the man you're looking for.

28:27.948 --> 28:29.691
He's the man that killed Nadia.

28:30.534 --> 28:33.952
Where is he? Cairo?

28:33.954 --> 28:35.203
He's dead.

28:35.205 --> 28:36.538
What?

28:36.540 --> 28:39.284
He died in a car accident two years ago.

28:42.128 --> 28:43.294
No.

28:43.642 --> 28:45.415
That can't be true.

28:46.800 --> 28:48.516
Where did you get this information?

28:48.518 --> 28:50.748
Egyptian Intelligence.
We checked it ourselves.

28:50.750 --> 28:52.261
- It's true.
- Why should I believe you?

28:52.263 --> 28:53.721
Because if I was going to lie to you,

28:53.723 --> 28:55.190
I'd tell you he's alive.

28:55.192 --> 28:56.191
I know it's not what
you want to hear, Sam,

28:56.193 --> 28:57.761
but it's the truth.

28:58.478 --> 29:00.311
I've searched for this man for years.

29:00.313 --> 29:02.981
Listen to me, time is
running out. We had a deal.

29:02.983 --> 29:05.316
I give you a name, you help
me stop the next bombing.

29:05.318 --> 29:08.820
A deal? You gave me
the name of a dead man!

29:08.822 --> 29:10.655
Sam, if you don't tell me
where the attack

29:10.657 --> 29:12.574
is going to happen,
hundreds of people will die.

29:12.576 --> 29:15.493
And what about Nadia?
Who will answer for her?

29:15.495 --> 29:17.996
You can't bring Nadia back
by helping to spill more blood.

29:17.998 --> 29:20.498
There are other Nadias out
there, other innocent victims.

29:20.500 --> 29:22.500
Don't use your mind games on me!

29:22.502 --> 29:24.586
I understand. I understand
you must be angry, Sam.

29:24.588 --> 29:26.504
You don't understand anything.

29:26.506 --> 29:28.389
Tell me, if Nadia was standing here

29:28.391 --> 29:30.258
right here, right now,
tell me she wouldn't want

29:30.260 --> 29:32.010
to save the lives of those
innocent victims.

29:32.012 --> 29:33.761
Better yet, Sam, tell her yourself!

29:33.763 --> 29:35.847
Go ahead! Here, tell her!

29:35.849 --> 29:37.515
Tell her you don't have
the courage to do this.

29:37.517 --> 29:39.100
- Stop!
- Tell her, Sam!

29:39.102 --> 29:40.518
Because tomorrow will be too late.

29:40.520 --> 29:42.770
If this bomb goes off, it's on you.

29:42.772 --> 29:44.272
Tell her, Sam!

29:44.274 --> 29:47.692
The target of the next attack,
what is it?

29:58.088 --> 30:00.199
Nadia had twice my courage.

30:02.792 --> 30:05.710
She would've never agreed
to work for Tal.

30:10.767 --> 30:14.802
1225 Wellington Street in Dulles.

30:18.642 --> 30:22.054
Thank you, Sam. Thank you.

30:28.106 --> 30:30.524
Kate, what do we know about that address?

30:30.526 --> 30:33.678
1225 Wellington is the
address for Crossroads Bank,

30:33.680 --> 30:35.612
it's an international investment firm.

30:36.151 --> 30:37.751
Uh, just wait.

30:38.195 --> 30:39.836
I've seen this man before.

30:42.143 --> 30:43.859
Yes, Wallis Reynolds, he's the CFO.

30:43.861 --> 30:46.812
He was killed in the New Jersey bombing.

30:46.814 --> 30:50.892
And all the bank's holdings,
tax filings, annual returns...

30:50.917 --> 30:52.333
they've all been redacted.

30:52.793 --> 30:54.886
That's because it's not a real bank.

30:54.888 --> 30:56.706
I recognize this pattern

30:56.707 --> 30:58.456
and I know why Tal's targeting it.

30:58.458 --> 31:02.260
Crossroads is a front company
that finances Agency black ops

31:02.262 --> 31:03.762
through offshore accounts.

31:03.764 --> 31:05.930
So all these employees are CIA?

31:05.932 --> 31:08.883
No, they're civilians who
think they work at a real bank.

31:08.885 --> 31:10.802
But Tal murdered the CFO
because he was probably

31:10.804 --> 31:12.554
the only one that was read-in,

31:12.556 --> 31:14.973
and now he's taking out the entire bank.

31:29.693 --> 31:31.193
Pettigrew, coordinate with the local PD

31:31.195 --> 31:32.945
and make sure all these
people get out safe.

31:32.947 --> 31:34.244
Copy that. This way, come this way.

31:34.246 --> 31:36.865
I want to clear a two-block
radius around this building.

31:36.867 --> 31:38.784
Keep coming, keep coming.

31:43.695 --> 31:45.862
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

31:47.010 --> 31:49.677
Kate, have you accessed the
building's CCTV system yet?

31:49.713 --> 31:51.046
I just got it up.

31:51.048 --> 31:52.385
Any sign of the suspects?

31:52.387 --> 31:54.716
No, not yet, but we have another issue.

31:54.718 --> 31:56.624
The local police are saying the elevators

31:56.626 --> 31:58.603
and the electronic door locks
have been disabled.

31:58.605 --> 32:01.640
Everyone above the mezzanine
level is still trapped inside.

32:01.642 --> 32:03.525
What happened to the exits?

32:03.527 --> 32:05.310
Excuse me, excuse me. Sorry.

32:08.098 --> 32:09.598
I think Tal's operatives

32:09.600 --> 32:11.016
got into the building's security network.

32:11.018 --> 32:12.517
I think they've shut everything down.

32:12.519 --> 32:13.935
This building's 13 stories.

32:13.937 --> 32:15.437
There's still hundreds of people in here.

32:15.439 --> 32:16.772
Kate, can you remotely unlock those doors

32:16.774 --> 32:17.902
and get those elevators going?

32:17.904 --> 32:19.280
I'll see what I can do.

32:19.282 --> 32:21.493
Now keep going, keep going, keep going.

32:26.033 --> 32:28.533
I need you to take us
to your security station.

32:30.871 --> 32:33.560
Keaton, I think that guard works for Tal.

32:51.225 --> 32:53.358
I think I know where the
other operatives might be.

32:53.360 --> 32:54.893
- Where?
- The 4th floor.

32:54.895 --> 32:56.330
The CCTV camera's on that floor.

32:56.332 --> 32:58.897
- They're all offline.
- We're headed up there now.

32:58.899 --> 33:00.383
Something's not right here.

33:00.385 --> 33:01.855
- I'm gonna check this out.
- Go check it out.

33:04.154 --> 33:08.073
Let me talk to you.
Hey, let me talk to you.

33:15.382 --> 33:18.750
Bragg, he could be trying
to detonate a bomb.

33:35.185 --> 33:37.269
Found the bombs.

33:37.271 --> 33:39.104
They're attached to
the structural columns.

33:39.106 --> 33:40.961
If they go off, they can take
down this whole building.

33:41.525 --> 33:42.858
Can you disarm them?

33:42.860 --> 33:44.464
I don't know yet.

33:47.531 --> 33:49.219
We have a problem.

33:50.617 --> 33:53.014
This whole floor is filled
with explosives.

33:55.301 --> 33:57.135
What's going on?

34:15.475 --> 34:17.225
Hey, no!

34:19.563 --> 34:20.728
Don't move!

34:26.904 --> 34:29.154
They triggered the countdown.

34:29.989 --> 34:32.262
I can't get into anything.

34:34.628 --> 34:36.077
Can you stop it?

34:36.079 --> 34:37.829
We're working on it.
It's not looking good.

34:37.831 --> 34:38.830
Please, keep moving.

34:38.831 --> 34:40.665
This way. Let's go.

34:40.667 --> 34:41.666
Kate, give me something.

34:41.668 --> 34:43.335
Bragg, I'm trying.

34:43.337 --> 34:44.835
I have an idea.

34:44.838 --> 34:46.588
They're using an isolated
detonation device

34:46.590 --> 34:48.306
to set off the explosives.

34:48.308 --> 34:49.591
If I can disconnect this,

34:49.592 --> 34:51.342
those other bombs won't detonate.

35:20.791 --> 35:23.208
Uhh!

35:42.529 --> 35:44.029
Is there anybody in the basement?

35:44.031 --> 35:46.398
No, it's empty. Why?

35:49.152 --> 35:51.569
Oh!

35:57.711 --> 36:00.517
Keaton, are you okay?

36:04.668 --> 36:06.584
Yeah, I'm good.

36:06.586 --> 36:08.553
It's over.

36:18.733 --> 36:20.066
How many exactly?

36:20.068 --> 36:23.569
There were 164 employees in the building.

36:23.571 --> 36:27.039
164 lives for Nadia.

36:29.173 --> 36:31.172
Can I see my wallet?

36:31.746 --> 36:33.996
Yeah, here you go.

36:33.998 --> 36:37.216
This is a pin that Nadia gave to me.

36:37.218 --> 36:38.668
I want you to have it.

36:45.844 --> 36:47.355
Thank you.

36:50.014 --> 36:52.431
It's the Eye of Horus, isn't it?

36:52.433 --> 36:54.567
It's a symbol of protection.

36:54.569 --> 36:56.823
It's also a symbol of healing.

36:58.189 --> 37:02.108
That's what Nadia gives me even in death.

37:06.447 --> 37:08.614
Stay out of trouble, Sam.

37:08.616 --> 37:11.450
When I was setting up the mesh network,

37:11.452 --> 37:14.286
Tal asked me about its range over water.

37:14.799 --> 37:16.255
- Over water?
- Yeah.

37:16.257 --> 37:19.759
And when I said it depends on
environmental factors,

37:19.761 --> 37:23.462
he asked, "Well, what about
over a warm gulf?"

37:23.464 --> 37:25.765
Does that mean anything to you?

37:25.767 --> 37:29.101
Not sure. Thank you.

37:42.567 --> 37:44.116
You keep doing what you're doing,

37:44.118 --> 37:46.485
you might be a pretty
good interrogator one day.

37:46.487 --> 37:48.333
One day you're going to get us all fired.

37:52.160 --> 37:53.659
What are you doing, Will?

37:53.661 --> 37:56.162
Black-bagging people in the street?

37:56.831 --> 37:58.581
There's something you're not telling me.

37:58.583 --> 38:00.720
Something about Shepherd.
There has to be.

38:03.504 --> 38:05.838
I just hope you know what you're doing.

38:18.936 --> 38:20.990
Deputy Director Molinero.

38:21.439 --> 38:22.822
People forget

38:22.824 --> 38:26.826
Frazier started his career
with 29 straight wins.

38:26.828 --> 38:29.457
Number 27 was Muhammad Ali.

38:30.114 --> 38:33.282
Then he lost four
of his next eight fights

38:33.284 --> 38:34.533
and never recovered.

38:34.535 --> 38:36.702
We still talking about boxing?

38:36.704 --> 38:38.871
You did good work today.

38:38.873 --> 38:41.791
Stopped a Tal attack,
saved a lot of lives.

38:41.793 --> 38:43.626
But you also let a mole inside

38:43.628 --> 38:45.377
the Counterintelligence Division.

38:45.379 --> 38:47.179
That mistake set us back months.

38:47.181 --> 38:49.381
Not to mention, it's
probably how Tal discovered

38:49.383 --> 38:52.685
Crossroads was a CIA front
company in the first place.

38:52.687 --> 38:54.887
One step forward, two steps back.

38:54.889 --> 38:57.556
We also uncovered Tal's
communications network.

38:57.558 --> 38:59.975
No telling what type of
intelligence that will unearth.

38:59.977 --> 39:03.729
The objective of this unit
isn't to gather intelligence.

39:03.731 --> 39:06.198
It's to apprehend dangerous
spies and operatives,

39:06.200 --> 39:09.201
and Mikhail Tal is still at large.

39:09.203 --> 39:11.704
Anna Cruz was your last mistake.

39:11.706 --> 39:13.155
Next one, you're out.

39:13.157 --> 39:14.740
There's not going to be anymore mistakes.

39:14.742 --> 39:16.242
If you want to keep that promise,

39:16.244 --> 39:18.244
I suggest you stop relying
on the advice of a traitor.

39:18.246 --> 39:20.045
Shepherd is part of the reason

39:20.047 --> 39:22.135
we're closer than we've
ever been at catching Tal.

39:23.136 --> 39:25.722
Assuming she still doesn't
still work for him.

39:26.504 --> 39:28.337
Good night, Will.

39:44.272 --> 39:45.533
What?

39:50.862 --> 39:52.332
What's wrong?

39:52.864 --> 39:54.947
You daughter called me today.

39:59.537 --> 40:01.216
What did she say?

40:02.305 --> 40:08.806
