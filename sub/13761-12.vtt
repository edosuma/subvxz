WEBVTT

00:03.320 --> 00:04.990
Vader, did you know

00:05.020 --> 00:08.950
there are only a few shopping
days left until Empire Day?

00:08.990 --> 00:10.320
I did.

00:10.360 --> 00:13.930
And can you guess what's at
the top of my wish list?

00:13.960 --> 00:16.230
Hmm. Socks?

00:16.270 --> 00:19.200
Ooh, nice idea.
My feet do get cold.

00:19.240 --> 00:21.310
But, uh, no.
Guess again.

00:21.340 --> 00:25.080
The total destruction
of the Rebel Alliance?

00:25.110 --> 00:29.010
Definitely on the list,
but not quite at the top.

00:29.050 --> 00:30.180
One more try.

00:30.210 --> 00:33.080
The Kyber Saber?

00:33.120 --> 00:35.950
Ding-ding-ding!
We have a winner!

00:35.990 --> 00:37.990
Agent Naare,

00:38.020 --> 00:40.980
<i>make it an Empire Day
to remember</i>

00:41.020 --> 00:43.890
<i>and bring me my Kyber Saber!</i>

00:46.300 --> 00:49.270
Okay, Naare, that Freemaker
kid may have disappeared

00:49.300 --> 00:52.300
to who knows where with the last
crystal, but we're not through.

00:52.340 --> 00:55.170
We're gonna have the last laugh.

00:55.210 --> 00:57.340
"Ha-ha," we will say.

00:57.370 --> 01:00.140
Maybe...
Maybe "ho-ho" too.

01:00.180 --> 01:03.180
And you know what? For you, I'm gonna
throw in a "hee-hee" in there.

01:03.210 --> 01:05.170
You wanna know why?

01:05.220 --> 01:08.150
We'll laugh last
because we Hutts

01:08.190 --> 01:11.990
have eyes and ears
all around the galaxy.

01:12.020 --> 01:13.920
Noses too.

01:13.960 --> 01:16.860
More useful than you would
imagine, but I digress.

01:16.890 --> 01:18.920
Now those Freemakers
have to turn up somewhere.

01:18.960 --> 01:21.990
They have to.
And when they do, bam!

01:22.030 --> 01:24.330
I'll be the first
to hear about it.

01:24.370 --> 01:27.340
So? What do you say?

01:27.370 --> 01:31.280
Did I turn your frown
upside down?

01:31.310 --> 01:33.180
Naare?

01:33.210 --> 01:37.150
I almost had the last
Kyber Saber crystal,

01:37.180 --> 01:42.020
and then... Rowan
Freemaker tricked me!

01:43.090 --> 01:45.020
Oof!

01:45.060 --> 01:46.190
You know what?

01:46.220 --> 01:50.050
I think we should all
give Naare some quiet time.

01:50.090 --> 01:53.020
Yep. Oh, yes.
Most definitely.

02:01.170 --> 02:05.100
Hey. Hi. Hello. May we have
a moment of your time?

02:05.140 --> 02:07.940
We're looking for
our brother, Rowan.

02:07.980 --> 02:09.949
Have you seen him?
Sorry.

02:09.979 --> 02:12.080
Mesa no see him.

02:14.020 --> 02:15.990
Excuse me.
Hate to bother you.

02:16.020 --> 02:18.020
But have you seen our brother?

02:18.050 --> 02:22.320
Take a long look.
Absorb the details.

02:22.360 --> 02:24.860
I said a long look.

02:26.930 --> 02:29.230
Chief Attiburra,
you remember Rowan.

02:29.270 --> 02:32.340
Have you seen him?

02:34.270 --> 02:36.230
How 'bout you, Tantarra?

02:39.180 --> 02:41.210
Hey, how 'bout you guys?

02:41.240 --> 02:44.110
Seen him?
No.

02:44.150 --> 02:46.920
I can't feel my toes.

02:48.080 --> 02:50.110
We're looking for our brother.

02:50.150 --> 02:53.020
He's got an old
battle droid with him,

02:53.060 --> 02:55.990
so we thought you might
have seen them.

02:57.930 --> 02:59.360
Okay. No idea
what that means.

02:59.400 --> 03:03.870
Are you saying
our brother is over there?

03:07.240 --> 03:09.170
I swear he's trying
to tell us something.

03:09.210 --> 03:11.210
Yeah, he's trying to tell us
we're nerf herders.

03:11.240 --> 03:13.170
Pickpockets!

03:13.210 --> 03:15.180
Hey! Come here!

03:15.210 --> 03:17.170
Come here! Hey!
Come back!

03:17.210 --> 03:19.170
Aaah!

03:21.990 --> 03:23.120
They're making their getaway!

03:23.150 --> 03:26.920
And there's nothing
we can do to stop them.

03:26.960 --> 03:29.060
This is hopeless.

03:29.090 --> 03:32.850
It'd be easier to find a single
flea on a bantha's back.

03:32.900 --> 03:36.300
I don't know
what else we can do.

03:36.330 --> 03:37.960
We could trust in Rowan.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.860
At some point, he'll come to
his senses and head home.

03:40.900 --> 03:44.230
But he won't find us if we're
out here trying to find him.

03:44.270 --> 03:48.200
Without a holo-emitter, we can't show
anybody what he looks like anyway,

03:48.250 --> 03:52.250
so let's grab the <i> StarScavenger</i>
and head back to the Wheel.

03:59.060 --> 04:01.060
<i>Yep!</i>

04:05.100 --> 04:08.000
Rowan, where are you?

04:16.240 --> 04:18.180
Focus.

04:18.209 --> 04:19.279
Concentrate.

04:20.339 --> 04:22.240
Go!

04:25.180 --> 04:27.210
Ha!

04:29.190 --> 04:31.060
Look out.

04:31.090 --> 04:33.090
Thanks.
Any time.

04:33.120 --> 04:35.080
- Can we go home now?
- No.

04:35.130 --> 04:38.100
Show me Master Fisto again.

04:38.130 --> 04:40.900
Kit Fisto, coming right up.

04:42.100 --> 04:45.870
Hmm. Master Fisto
used a defensive form.

04:45.900 --> 04:48.060
Uh-huh. Listen, this may
come as a surprise,

04:48.100 --> 04:51.270
but reliving every time
a Jedi cut me in half

04:51.310 --> 04:53.310
isn't my idea of a good time.

04:53.340 --> 04:57.240
Uh-uh... No, wait!
Can't we discuss this...

04:57.280 --> 04:59.280
Aaah!

04:59.320 --> 05:03.820
Sorry, Roger.
I wanna go home too.

05:03.850 --> 05:08.020
I'd give anything
to see Zander and Kordi again.

05:08.060 --> 05:09.230
Anything.

05:09.260 --> 05:13.070
But I'm not ready to face
Naare, and your memories...

05:13.100 --> 05:15.070
My painful memories?

05:15.100 --> 05:19.970
Yeah. They're the closest thing
I've got to actual Jedi training.

05:22.110 --> 05:25.840
If it takes years
of practice to beat Naare,

05:25.880 --> 05:27.850
then that's what it takes.
Hah!

05:30.010 --> 05:33.840
It's creepy.
She hasn't moved all day.

05:33.880 --> 05:36.280
Yeah, she's catatont...
catatone... catatonk...

05:36.320 --> 05:38.190
She hasn't moved.
Yeah.

05:39.260 --> 05:42.190
She's sleeping.
Or she's dead.

05:42.230 --> 05:46.060
- Poke her with a stick.
- I'm meditating.

05:46.100 --> 05:48.230
Using the Force to sense Rowan.

05:48.260 --> 05:51.160
Which isn't easy with all
the babbling noise in here!

05:51.200 --> 05:52.960
Sorry.

05:53.000 --> 05:54.930
Touchy. Mmm.

05:54.970 --> 05:57.970
Yeppau! Hey, hey! Got news for us?
Yep.

05:58.010 --> 05:59.950
Somebody saw the kid!
Nope.

05:59.980 --> 06:02.280
Nobody saw the kid.
This you call news?

06:02.310 --> 06:04.910
But they did spot
his brother and sister.

06:04.950 --> 06:06.920
They were looking for him too.

06:06.950 --> 06:09.890
But they gave up and went home.

06:09.920 --> 06:11.360
Oh, that's nice.

06:11.390 --> 06:15.260
His brother and sister, who also
have no idea where he is, went home.

06:15.290 --> 06:17.150
You know what this tells us?

06:17.190 --> 06:20.190
A big heaping load of nothing!

06:20.230 --> 06:22.270
Nothing!

06:22.300 --> 06:25.000
Am I gettin' through
to you people?

06:25.030 --> 06:26.290
Your blank stares tell me no.

06:26.340 --> 06:31.980
Okay, you know what? I'll be
specific and loud... We need the boy!

06:32.010 --> 06:33.950
The boy!

06:33.980 --> 06:36.950
Nothing but the boy!

06:36.980 --> 06:38.950
No.

06:38.980 --> 06:40.940
If the Freemakers have split up,

06:40.980 --> 06:42.940
there's an opportunity here.

06:42.990 --> 06:44.990
Set course for the Wheel.

06:46.000 --> 06:52.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:01.140 --> 07:03.210
Home.

07:03.240 --> 07:06.040
Some familiar sights
and sounds will feel good.

07:06.080 --> 07:09.050
Freemakers!
There you are.

07:09.080 --> 07:11.020
And some, not so good.

07:11.050 --> 07:14.090
- Hello, Furlac.
- I haven't seen you in ages.

07:14.120 --> 07:16.890
I feared for your safety.

07:16.920 --> 07:18.960
You did?
Of course he did, Zander.

07:18.990 --> 07:22.260
If we'd been vaporized,
disintegrated and/or annihilated,

07:22.290 --> 07:23.920
who would pay the rent?

07:23.960 --> 07:25.900
You read my mind!

07:25.930 --> 07:28.200
And I didn't even use the Force.

07:28.230 --> 07:31.230
Let's see. You're behind
on three rent payments.

07:31.270 --> 07:34.110
And somebody blew a hole
in your door.

07:34.140 --> 07:36.240
I'll take that out
of your security deposit.

07:36.270 --> 07:38.070
We'll pay it all, Furlac.

07:38.110 --> 07:40.210
Just give us a few days
to raise the money.

07:40.240 --> 07:42.070
With late fees?

07:42.110 --> 07:44.110
With late fees.
Of course.

07:44.150 --> 07:46.150
Splendid!

07:46.180 --> 07:48.910
Didn't there used
to be three of you?

07:48.950 --> 07:51.080
Uh, wasn't there a shortish one?

07:51.120 --> 07:54.030
Yeah, there was.
There still is.

07:54.060 --> 07:56.330
We just don't know where
Rowan is at the moment.

07:56.360 --> 08:01.900
It's a question that's
been on everyone's mind.

08:08.840 --> 08:11.840
I see you have business to
discuss, so, uh, toodles!

08:18.160 --> 08:21.990
Rowan has the last crystal, and we have
no idea You're owhere he is.Naare.

08:22.040 --> 08:25.070
And even if we did, we'd
never tell you. Never!

08:25.100 --> 08:28.870
Ah, but there are ways
of bringing Rowan here.

08:28.910 --> 08:31.850
You see, through the Force,
he will feel your pain.

08:31.880 --> 08:34.880
Pain? Ha!
You wanna talk pain?

08:34.909 --> 08:35.940
I can take pain.

08:35.980 --> 08:39.710
Do your worst!

08:40.890 --> 08:44.690
Oh, I will. But I'm not
talking physical pain.

08:44.720 --> 08:45.780
You're not?

08:45.830 --> 08:48.760
No, that's Vader's game.

08:48.800 --> 08:51.700
So unimaginative.

08:51.730 --> 08:57.030
Zander, have I ever told you how
much I admire the <i> StarScavenger?</i>

08:57.070 --> 09:01.640
Ah! I can tell you've put
a lot of work into her.

09:01.670 --> 09:06.070
Well, not to brag, but I've made
quite a few modifications and...

09:17.960 --> 09:19.890
Hmm.

09:19.930 --> 09:21.860
All your hard work.

09:21.890 --> 09:24.690
Oh, this must be
very upsetting for you.

09:27.730 --> 09:30.760
She's so good at her job.

09:30.800 --> 09:33.670
Fight it, Zander.
It's just a ship.

09:33.710 --> 09:36.710
- We can rebuild it.
- Rebuild?

09:36.740 --> 09:38.140
- Tough!
- Now, Kordi.

09:38.180 --> 09:40.150
You have a different
pressure point.

09:40.180 --> 09:42.020
Yours is in...

09:45.080 --> 09:46.980
your money box.

09:47.020 --> 09:50.060
No! The money box is poor!
It has no credits.

09:50.090 --> 09:53.030
Ah, lucky you.

09:53.060 --> 09:55.000
It does.

09:56.960 --> 09:59.020
Look, Kordi.

09:59.070 --> 10:01.870
You have... credits...

10:01.900 --> 10:03.800
to... burn.

10:03.840 --> 10:07.780
Yah-ho-ho-ho!

10:07.810 --> 10:09.780
Sorry.
Wasn't expecting that.

10:09.810 --> 10:12.750
I just...
That's hard to watch.

10:12.780 --> 10:16.180
I'm gonna go get a salty snack, okay?
Anybody want anything?

10:16.220 --> 10:19.790
Enough games. Let's hit you
where it really hurts.

10:21.790 --> 10:25.190
No! Not the <i> Blazemaker!</i>
Not my baby!

10:25.220 --> 10:28.150
Yes. Your baby.

10:33.030 --> 10:35.960
Roger, I need
to see Geonosis again.

10:36.000 --> 10:38.100
No, no, no, no, no.
Too scary.

10:38.140 --> 10:41.910
How 'bout the one where I
accidentally fall down some stairs?

10:41.940 --> 10:44.900
Aaah!

10:44.940 --> 10:47.810
Ha-ha-ha!
Classic me.

10:47.850 --> 10:49.980
- Roger.
- Ah, fine.

10:50.020 --> 10:53.820
But if you ever get sliced
to bits by three powerful Jedi,

10:53.850 --> 10:58.850
I hope I get to watch your memory
of it over and over again.

10:58.890 --> 11:01.790
Obi-Wan Kenobi,

11:01.830 --> 11:05.130
Anakin Skywalker

11:05.160 --> 11:08.090
and... Mace Windu.

11:08.130 --> 11:10.760
He still gives me chills
up my spine.

11:10.840 --> 11:14.080
Or he would if I,
you know, had a spine.

11:14.110 --> 11:16.980
Oh! That's where
he cut me to pieces.

11:17.010 --> 11:18.180
Six, if I remember correctly.

11:18.210 --> 11:20.940
Thanks, Roger.

11:20.980 --> 11:22.980
Focus.

11:25.020 --> 11:28.960
Kenobi. Skywalker.

11:28.990 --> 11:31.890
- You're getting better.
- Windu.

11:36.900 --> 11:38.930
Kordi? Zand...
Ow!

11:38.970 --> 11:40.840
I withdraw my last comment.

11:41.870 --> 11:44.140
I... I felt Kordi
and Zander

11:44.170 --> 11:45.810
through the Force.

11:45.840 --> 11:49.210
- You can do that?
- I know. It's news to me too.

11:49.240 --> 11:51.740
I think they're in pain.

11:53.250 --> 11:55.080
Naare...

11:57.050 --> 11:58.190
is hurting them!

11:58.220 --> 12:00.920
They've gone home to the Wheel.

12:00.950 --> 12:03.080
- We have to go help.
- Rowan, we can't.

12:03.120 --> 12:06.850
First you wanted to go,
now you want to stay?

12:06.890 --> 12:08.990
It's a trap!
Of course it's a trap.

12:09.030 --> 12:11.000
But what other choice
do we have?

12:11.030 --> 12:14.770
Stay here and guard
the last Kyber Saber crystal?

12:14.800 --> 12:16.930
Remember?
To save the galaxy?

12:16.970 --> 12:19.770
What's the point
of saving the galaxy

12:19.810 --> 12:22.780
if the people you love
aren't in it?

12:22.810 --> 12:24.710
You coming?

12:24.740 --> 12:27.740
I'd rather face
those Jedi again.

12:37.120 --> 12:40.120
Give it up, Naare.
Rowan's not coming.

12:40.160 --> 12:42.030
Your plan failed.

12:42.060 --> 12:45.060
And you ruined my precious ships for...
nothing.

12:45.100 --> 12:50.910
Hmm. Maybe the kid
never got your message.

12:50.940 --> 12:54.010
Maybe he's not as strong
in the Force as you think.

12:54.040 --> 12:58.850
Or perhaps I need to send
a stronger message.

12:58.880 --> 13:01.780
You know what?
We'll do this Vader's way.

13:09.790 --> 13:10.790
Aaah!

13:14.090 --> 13:16.090
Lookin' for me?

13:17.760 --> 13:19.120
Rowan!
Rowan!

13:19.170 --> 13:21.100
You've been training.

13:21.130 --> 13:22.690
I have.

13:22.740 --> 13:26.040
Oh, you brat!
You almost flattened me!

13:32.010 --> 13:34.040
Shield me! Shield
your beloved employer!

13:36.080 --> 13:39.740
This is for the <i> Blazemaker!</i>
You moof milkers!

13:41.790 --> 13:45.890
Tell me where the crystal is, Rowan,
and we can end this now, no fuss.

13:45.930 --> 13:47.760
Sorry.

13:49.200 --> 13:50.800
I like a fuss.

13:50.830 --> 13:52.130
So be it.

14:00.560 --> 14:01.830
Now!

14:04.790 --> 14:07.890
Did you really think
I wouldn't see that com...

14:13.840 --> 14:15.810
We're outgunned here.
Maybe.

14:15.840 --> 14:18.740
But this is our home.
Nobody knows it like us.

14:18.770 --> 14:20.840
Excellent point.
I'm going to try something.

14:20.880 --> 14:22.750
Cover me.

14:30.690 --> 14:32.720
Do we get paid
for disintegrations?

14:32.760 --> 14:34.630
Don't know.
Don't care.

14:34.660 --> 14:36.560
This guy's worth
frying for free.

14:40.600 --> 14:43.500
Whoa!

14:43.530 --> 14:44.890
Aw, no fair!

14:53.780 --> 14:56.710
Ah, your skills have grown
by leaps and bounds.

14:56.750 --> 14:57.880
I'm impressed.

14:57.910 --> 15:00.740
Yeah, learning my master
was an evil Sith

15:00.780 --> 15:02.710
really motivated me.

15:17.670 --> 15:20.670
Nowhere to run, girl.
You're trapped.

15:20.700 --> 15:23.600
You look hot.
Let me turn on a fan.

15:25.510 --> 15:26.480
Oh!

15:38.850 --> 15:40.780
Give me the crystal.

15:41.890 --> 15:43.790
I want that crystal!

15:43.830 --> 15:47.670
You don't really think I'd be dumb
enough to bring it with me, do you?

15:47.700 --> 15:49.670
Where is the crystal?
Hidden on a planet.

15:49.700 --> 15:53.600
I can't tell you what planet because
I don't even know its name.

15:58.640 --> 15:59.700
Oh!

16:02.480 --> 16:05.550
Fellas, I'm just gonna throw this
idea out there, take it or leave it,

16:05.580 --> 16:08.910
but you could just let go
of the blasters, right?

16:08.950 --> 16:12.510
And walk into this battle zone
without a weapon? Pfft!

16:12.560 --> 16:14.930
- Use your head, boss!
- Hey, Graballa!

16:17.890 --> 16:20.820
Whoa-ho-ho-ho!

16:26.840 --> 16:28.810
This is, uh, familiar.

16:28.840 --> 16:31.810
Yeah.
Been here before.

16:31.840 --> 16:34.600
Which one of you has keys
in your pockets?

16:37.680 --> 16:41.590
Defensive form. Waiting
for me to make a mistake.

16:47.520 --> 16:51.550
Using my attack against me.
That's a favorite of Darth Vader.

16:51.590 --> 16:54.520
Oh, yeah? Well, I picked it
up from Anakin Skywalker.

16:54.560 --> 16:56.520
How?
Skywalker is gone.

16:59.900 --> 17:02.800
- There are no Jedi.
- Hah!

17:02.840 --> 17:04.810
Who taught you these techniques?

17:04.839 --> 17:07.450
I taught him.

17:07.480 --> 17:10.780
- You?
- Showed him all the Jedi.

17:10.810 --> 17:12.810
Including Mace Windu!

17:20.720 --> 17:23.680
See, I'm a veteran
of the Clone Wars.

17:23.730 --> 17:25.800
I saw lots of Jedi fight.

17:25.829 --> 17:29.730
And everything I see,
I remember.

17:31.630 --> 17:33.590
Everything?

17:33.640 --> 17:37.510
Including the location
of the last crystal?

17:37.540 --> 17:40.550
- Uh-oh.
- Uh-oh.

17:40.580 --> 17:41.950
Run, Roger!

17:42.950 --> 17:44.920
Whoa! Oof!

17:50.890 --> 17:52.520
Whoa!

17:52.560 --> 17:54.890
Wait. I misspoke.
I-I remember nothing!

17:54.920 --> 17:57.790
I... Aaah!

18:01.730 --> 18:04.640
I should've kept
my big mouth shut.

18:17.780 --> 18:22.650
I've won!

18:22.690 --> 18:25.490
Yay, team us.
We won. Hooray.

18:25.520 --> 18:27.580
Good celebration.
Now business.

18:27.620 --> 18:30.490
- When do I get my share of the crystals?
- Your share?

18:30.530 --> 18:32.560
Yeah, we're going
halfsies, remember?

18:32.600 --> 18:35.470
And not to complain,
but I need to get paid.

18:35.500 --> 18:38.500
See, I told my broker I'd have
the deposit for my resort soon,

18:38.530 --> 18:43.800
so give me my half, I'll sell 'em to the
Emperor, and boom... everybody's happy.

18:43.840 --> 18:45.840
My dear Graballa.

18:45.910 --> 18:50.750
I may have forgotten to mention
one tiny, inconsequential thing...

18:50.780 --> 18:52.880
The Emperor's
not going to pay you.

18:52.920 --> 18:54.890
Uh... Come again?

18:54.920 --> 18:56.850
And neither am I.

18:56.890 --> 18:59.620
But we had a deal.

18:59.660 --> 19:02.660
Mmm, yes,
but... I'm a Sith.

19:02.690 --> 19:04.590
We lie.

19:04.630 --> 19:08.630
Sith or no, you do not
break a deal with a Hutt!

19:08.660 --> 19:11.660
Dengar, earn your pay!
Get that droid head.

19:11.700 --> 19:13.640
I'm going to enjoy this.

19:17.510 --> 19:20.910
Do you know what I enjoy?
Breaking things.

19:27.580 --> 19:29.510
Let's not lose our tempers here.

19:29.550 --> 19:31.580
Things were said,
regrettable things...

19:31.620 --> 19:33.860
I think we all
feel bad about it.

19:33.890 --> 19:35.930
I said some stuff,
you broke deals with me.

19:35.960 --> 19:37.830
Whatever it was,
it's regrettable.

19:37.860 --> 19:40.500
I think we both
just wanna reset and...

19:44.970 --> 19:48.670
Aaah!

19:50.770 --> 19:52.900
Consider our deal broken.

19:52.940 --> 19:58.640
And so, Roger, it's time for us
to retrieve the last crystal.

19:58.680 --> 20:00.840
I refuse to show you
where it is.

20:00.880 --> 20:03.810
Ha! That'll show you,
you wicked...

20:03.850 --> 20:06.580
Never mind.

20:06.620 --> 20:07.720
N-Naare!

20:10.630 --> 20:11.760
I'm not done with you.

20:11.790 --> 20:14.660
Yes, but I'm
quite done with you.

20:27.680 --> 20:29.880
Rowan!

20:32.620 --> 20:35.890
Rowan learned a few tricks,
did quite well.

20:35.920 --> 20:38.960
I'll even admit he impressed me.

20:38.990 --> 20:43.830
But in the end...
he was no Jedi.

20:54.940 --> 20:57.740
Come on!

20:57.770 --> 21:00.670
Push!

21:01.740 --> 21:02.870
Oh!

21:02.910 --> 21:04.740
Oh!

21:08.750 --> 21:10.580
Rowan!

21:15.820 --> 21:18.750
Rowan, you're alive!

21:18.790 --> 21:20.720
Are... Are you okay?

21:20.760 --> 21:23.620
No, Kordi. I failed.

21:26.600 --> 21:27.700
I'm not a Jedi.

21:31.640 --> 21:34.680
But... maybe
that's the point.

21:34.710 --> 21:36.580
Rowan?

21:37.680 --> 21:39.650
I'm not a Jedi.

21:40.780 --> 21:43.710
And I'm not a Sith.

21:43.750 --> 21:45.710
I'm a Freemaker.

21:50.830 --> 21:53.630
And I know

21:53.660 --> 21:56.590
how we're gonna beat Naare.
