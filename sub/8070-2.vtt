ROSEANNE: No, Jackie, I don't
even need to cook anymore.

00:59.527 --> 01:01.595
I got a microwave now.

01:01.695 --> 01:04.465
I don't even have to start
cooking till Dan comes home.

01:04.565 --> 01:08.336
Yeah, the other day I made a
meatloaf in, like, 12 minutes.

01:08.436 --> 01:10.838
Nah, it still tasted like
crap, but it was so hot,

01:10.938 --> 01:11.739
nobody could tell.

01:14.475 --> 01:16.410
Look, you have
got to talk to DJ.

01:16.510 --> 01:18.479
I was just in the
bathroom completely naked

01:18.579 --> 01:19.680
and he just barges in on me.

01:19.780 --> 01:23.551
Oh, great, you
traumatized him.

01:23.651 --> 01:25.153
He'll be gay for sure, now.

01:30.090 --> 01:32.860
God, I hate you, Darlene.

01:32.960 --> 01:34.094
Mother, are you listening to me?

01:34.195 --> 01:35.563
Your son is sick!

01:35.663 --> 01:36.997
Yeah, well, now
that he saw you naked,

01:37.097 --> 01:40.668
he's probably upstairs
puking his guts out.

01:40.768 --> 01:42.936
You shut your face or
I'll shut it for you.

01:43.036 --> 01:44.205
Go for it, Barbie!

01:44.305 --> 01:45.173
Maybe I will, Ken.

01:45.273 --> 01:46.607
Oh, yeah, that was funny.

01:46.707 --> 01:48.041
Hold on a minute, Jackie.

01:48.142 --> 01:49.210
I think I heard something.

01:49.310 --> 01:50.578
What?

01:50.678 --> 01:52.880
Mom, this is like the third
time he's walked in on me.

01:52.980 --> 01:54.548
It was an accident.

01:54.648 --> 01:55.716
Oh, yeah, right.

01:55.816 --> 01:57.885
I better call you
back later, Jackie.

01:57.985 --> 01:59.753
The sedative I gave
the kids for breakfast

01:59.853 --> 02:00.921
is starting to wear off.

02:08.429 --> 02:10.731
All right, look me in the eye
and tell me it was an accident.

02:10.831 --> 02:13.834
And remember, I can
tell when you're lying.

02:13.934 --> 02:17.137
It was an accident.

02:17.238 --> 02:18.105
Could you tell?

02:21.175 --> 02:22.743
I have so much to
teach you, sprout.

02:25.946 --> 02:27.748
Anybody home?
It's me, Arnie.

02:27.848 --> 02:30.083
Yeah, hi, come on in, Arnie.

02:30.184 --> 02:31.352
Mother!

02:31.452 --> 02:32.753
I'll talk to him later.

02:32.853 --> 02:33.721
Yeah, right.

02:33.821 --> 02:34.622
No, I will.

02:34.722 --> 02:35.823
Just keep your shirt on, there.

02:35.923 --> 02:39.026
Very funny.

02:39.126 --> 02:40.628
This a bad time, Rosie?

02:40.728 --> 02:44.365
Uh, it's a bad life, Arnie.

02:44.465 --> 02:45.999
I'm just about to nuke
some dinner though.

02:46.099 --> 02:47.735
Dan'll be home in a few minutes.

02:47.835 --> 02:48.936
I could go for
something to eat.

02:49.036 --> 02:50.070
Yeah?

02:50.170 --> 02:50.971
Well, then go.

02:53.607 --> 02:54.408
You're always a kidder.

02:54.508 --> 02:56.477
Ah, not always.

02:56.577 --> 02:58.546
Well, anyway, Nancy's got
dinner for me at home now.

02:58.646 --> 02:59.980
You know we're
shacking up, don't you?

03:00.080 --> 03:00.881
Oh, yeah?

03:00.981 --> 03:01.849
How romantic.

03:01.949 --> 03:03.584
Well, I got evicted
from my place,

03:03.684 --> 03:05.653
so it kind of worked
out pretty good.

03:05.753 --> 03:07.988
This way we get to spend a whole
lot more time with each other.

03:08.088 --> 03:09.990
It's like we're always together.

03:10.090 --> 03:12.426
Well, I guess there's
nothing like a little quantity

03:12.526 --> 03:14.595
time with the person you love.

03:14.695 --> 03:15.929
Yeah, but you
get tired of seeing

03:16.029 --> 03:17.898
that same face all the time.

03:17.998 --> 03:19.300
Hey, did I tell you
we're getting married?

03:22.403 --> 03:24.438
When's she due?

03:24.538 --> 03:26.307
You're kidding, right?

03:26.407 --> 03:27.275
Yeah, I'm kidding.

03:27.375 --> 03:28.276
Congratulations.

03:30.978 --> 03:32.280
I knew it.

03:32.380 --> 03:35.749
The minute I turn my back,
you went and stole my man.

03:35.849 --> 03:36.717
How's it going, buddy?

03:36.817 --> 03:38.185
Great, Dan, how you doing?

03:38.286 --> 03:40.153
Hang on a second, will you?

03:40.254 --> 03:41.955
Hey, Dan, how come
you never told me

03:42.055 --> 03:43.591
that Arnie was getting married?

03:43.691 --> 03:47.595
He didn't want it to get out
and mess up his dating action.

03:47.695 --> 03:50.331
Yeah, so many
magazines, so little time.

03:54.468 --> 03:55.569
I really appreciate
this, buddy.

03:55.669 --> 03:56.837
No problem.

03:56.937 --> 03:58.506
I'll have the money back
at six, seven weeks, tops.

03:58.606 --> 04:00.341
You're really
helping me out here.

04:00.441 --> 04:01.275
Check OK?

04:01.375 --> 04:02.175
You got an ID?

04:04.712 --> 04:05.646

See you guys.

04:05.746 --> 04:06.547
Yeah.

04:09.082 --> 04:09.883
"Got an ID?"

04:14.922 --> 04:16.990
How much money
did you lend him?

04:17.090 --> 04:18.526
- Couple bucks.
- How much?

04:18.626 --> 04:20.594
- $1,500.
- (SHOUTING) Get out of here!

04:20.694 --> 04:22.963
Roseanne, he's throwing
a lot of work my way.

04:23.063 --> 04:24.932
How could you do that
without talking to me?

04:25.032 --> 04:26.199
Look, I got it covered.

04:26.300 --> 04:27.668
I got steady work
till Christmas.

04:27.768 --> 04:29.337
Jeez, I'd never lend
out that kind of money

04:29.437 --> 04:30.638
without talking
to you first, Dan.

04:30.738 --> 04:32.773
Oh, come on, Roseanne.

04:32.873 --> 04:36.510
For once in my life, I can write
out a check to help a friend,

04:36.610 --> 04:38.512
no questions asked?

04:38.612 --> 04:39.947
It's for his engagement ring.

04:44.151 --> 04:45.986
Hey, how's this new
microwave working, hon?

04:46.086 --> 04:49.690
You know, the one I
bought you without asking?

04:49.790 --> 04:51.659
Oooh!

04:51.759 --> 04:54.628
All right, I should've
asked you first.

04:54.728 --> 04:56.397
What do you want me to do,
stick my head in the oven?

04:56.497 --> 04:57.297
OK.

05:00.501 --> 05:02.870

Dad.

05:15.983 --> 05:18.786
If DJ accidentally walks
in on me one more time,

05:18.886 --> 05:19.753
I swear I'm gonna kill him.

05:19.853 --> 05:20.721
I'm busy right now, Becky.

05:20.821 --> 05:22.390
I'll talk to DJ later.

05:22.490 --> 05:23.991
You say you'll
talk to DJ later.

05:24.091 --> 05:25.325
Mom says she'll
talk to him later.

05:25.426 --> 05:26.927
Is anybody going to do
anything about this?

05:27.027 --> 05:29.397
Why don't you try locking
your bathroom door, Becky?

05:29.497 --> 05:34.167
Oh, great, now it's my fault.
Everything wrong in this world

05:34.267 --> 05:35.202
is my fault.

05:35.302 --> 05:36.470
You just figured that out?

05:36.570 --> 05:39.873
Drop dead.

05:39.973 --> 05:42.476
Mom, you gotta go talk to DJ.

walked in on me again.

stop peeking at Becky.

I'll talk to him later after
I put the groceries away.

(SIGHING) All right.

Becky's always in a mood.

Putting together
a couple of bids.

06:08.469 --> 06:10.404
Well, my, aren't
you ambitious there?

06:10.504 --> 06:11.939
I thought you said you
had some job keeping

06:12.039 --> 06:13.073
you busy through Christmas.

06:13.173 --> 06:14.408
Not anymore.

06:14.508 --> 06:15.743
Company went belly-up.

06:15.843 --> 06:19.246
We're never going to see
that last $6,000 they owe me.

06:19.346 --> 06:21.014
Why does this
always happen to us?

06:21.114 --> 06:22.082
Oh, we're OK.

06:22.182 --> 06:24.217
I already got a couple
of jobs lined up.

06:24.317 --> 06:28.188
Just have to pay a couple of
small bills that are due now.

06:28.288 --> 06:31.425
Like what kind of small bills?

06:31.525 --> 06:33.661
Car payment,
mortgage, credit cards--

06:33.761 --> 06:35.829
oh, come on, cut it out.

06:35.929 --> 06:37.264
We're OK.

06:37.364 --> 06:38.699
Now, what do you mean by OK?

06:38.799 --> 06:42.670
You mean like "Becky can
still go to college" OK?

06:42.770 --> 06:48.108
Or, "Oh boy! the government's
giving away free cheese," OK.

06:48.208 --> 06:49.977
We don't need that much.

06:50.077 --> 06:51.078
And I know what you're thinking.

06:51.178 --> 06:52.846
Even if I did ask Arnie
for the money back,

06:52.946 --> 06:54.381
we'd still be short.

06:54.482 --> 06:57.117
By how much?

06:57.217 --> 06:58.318
$20.

06:58.418 --> 07:02.590
Roseanne, I didn't know
this was going to happen.

07:02.690 --> 07:04.825
Well, you know, I'm
sure Arnie won't mind.

07:04.925 --> 07:06.460
You know, why don't you
call him up and tell him

07:06.560 --> 07:08.061
to just give the money back?
- No way.

07:08.161 --> 07:09.329
It's done.

07:09.429 --> 07:10.798
Well, he probably didn't
even go buy that ring yet.

07:10.898 --> 07:12.533
You don't ask for money
back once you lend it out.

07:12.633 --> 07:14.401
- Who don't?
- A guy doesn't do that.

07:14.502 --> 07:15.703
A guy?

07:15.803 --> 07:20.541
So what is this, some kind
of testosterone thing here?

07:20.641 --> 07:23.611
(DEEP VOICE) I
got it covered, OK?

07:23.711 --> 07:26.947
And will you be letting
the little woman in on how?

07:27.047 --> 07:28.616
I'll just get a swing
loan from the bank.

07:28.716 --> 07:29.783
No problem.

07:29.883 --> 07:31.418
Well, why do you
want go to the bank?

07:31.519 --> 07:34.254
Because that's where
the money is, my pet.

07:34.354 --> 07:36.657
Yeah, but maybe you should,
like, ask your folks, you know?

07:36.757 --> 07:38.759
Or my folks.

07:38.859 --> 07:41.161
Yeah.

07:41.261 --> 07:43.063
Yeah, why don't I just
borrow it from your folks?

07:43.163 --> 07:44.064
Yeah, wait a minute.

07:44.164 --> 07:44.965
Oh!

07:50.070 --> 07:53.306
Well, the bank's just going to
charge you some huge interest.

07:53.406 --> 07:55.709
Roseanne, I know
how to cut a deal.

07:55.809 --> 07:58.478
I'll just go down there
tomorrow and waltz in and act

07:58.579 --> 08:00.247
like I don't need the money.

08:00.347 --> 08:03.283
You better act
like you got a gun.

08:03.383 --> 08:05.686
[music playing]

08:10.123 --> 08:12.860
Traffic directional
guidance apparatus.

08:12.960 --> 08:17.030
Or as we on the force like
to call them, white gloves.

08:17.130 --> 08:21.669
Without these, I'm just some
idiot standing in traffic.

08:21.769 --> 08:23.403
You know, with those,
you're just some--

08:23.503 --> 08:25.038
Stop.

08:25.138 --> 08:28.308
It's the power of the glove.

08:28.408 --> 08:33.180
So, uh, did you get these
moves at the police academy?

08:33.280 --> 08:34.447
No, the Pips.

08:39.519 --> 08:41.822
So how'd it go?

08:41.922 --> 08:42.723
Smooth.

08:42.823 --> 08:43.624
Ah!

08:43.724 --> 08:44.625
What's going on?

08:44.725 --> 08:46.359
How come you're all dressed up?

08:46.459 --> 08:47.561
What, this old thing?

08:47.661 --> 08:49.329
Come on, Dan.

08:49.429 --> 08:52.199
Jackie, do the words
"none of your business"

08:52.299 --> 08:53.901
mean anything to you?

08:54.001 --> 08:56.036
Well, go ahead
and tell her, Dan.

08:56.136 --> 08:57.237
She's family.

08:57.337 --> 08:59.406
I had to negotiate a
small loan from the bank.

08:59.506 --> 09:01.108
What do you need a loan for?

09:01.208 --> 09:02.442
I want to be in debt.
Bye.

09:02.542 --> 09:03.677
Come on, Dan.

09:03.777 --> 09:05.579
Came up a little
short this month,

09:05.679 --> 09:07.547
and I need some help
paying some bills.

09:07.648 --> 09:08.448
Happy?

09:08.548 --> 09:09.750
Oh, yeah?

09:09.850 --> 09:11.284
Well, I got a lot
of cash saved up.

09:11.384 --> 09:12.686
I could loan you a few bucks.
- No, thanks.

09:12.786 --> 09:13.821
Aw, Dan, come on.

09:13.921 --> 09:15.122
It'd be fun.

09:15.222 --> 09:16.857
I lend you money, you pay
me back-- it's like a game.

09:16.957 --> 09:19.993
Roseanne, make it stop.

09:20.093 --> 09:21.494
No, she's my sister.

09:21.595 --> 09:24.464
I say we should take her
for every cent she's got.

09:24.564 --> 09:25.599
How much you talking about?

09:25.699 --> 09:26.600
$1,500.

09:26.700 --> 09:27.735
Is that all?

09:27.835 --> 09:30.804
It's chump change.

09:30.904 --> 09:33.473
Not that all chumps would
have that kind of change.

09:33.573 --> 09:35.542
It's taken care of.

09:35.643 --> 09:36.677
Well, I don't know.

09:36.777 --> 09:38.178
How much interest are we
gonna pay on this loan?

09:38.278 --> 09:39.212
What difference does it make?

09:39.312 --> 09:41.949
(YELLING) I want to know!

There's a loan fee of
$150, and the interest

09:44.417 --> 09:46.787
rate is 19 and 1/2%, OK?

09:46.887 --> 09:49.857
Whoa, well, you really forced
them to their knees there, Ace.

09:49.957 --> 09:51.124
I'll tell you what.

09:51.224 --> 09:54.394
I won't charge you any
loan fee or interest,

09:54.494 --> 09:57.430
and all you gotta
do is just, uh, suck

09:57.530 --> 09:59.266
up to me for a couple of weeks.

09:59.366 --> 10:01.134
[laughter]

10:01.234 --> 10:03.336
Oh, well, hell, in that case--

10:03.436 --> 10:05.538
no.

10:05.639 --> 10:07.641
Well, how come it's
OK to go to the bank

10:07.741 --> 10:10.177
and pay all this huge interest,
but it's not OK to get

10:10.277 --> 10:11.779
it from Jackie for nothing?

10:11.879 --> 10:13.814
That's good business, dear.

10:13.914 --> 10:15.849
All right, forget sucking up.

10:15.949 --> 10:17.117
Just your undying gratitude.

10:17.217 --> 10:18.018
What are you, deaf?

10:18.118 --> 10:19.552
I said no.

10:19.653 --> 10:21.088
Hey, don't you go
yelling at my sister.

10:21.188 --> 10:22.455
I'm not yelling
at your sister.

10:22.555 --> 10:23.691
I just don't want
her damn money.

10:23.791 --> 10:25.092
But Dan--

10:25.192 --> 10:28.328
DAN: Hey, just keep your nose
out of my business, all right?

10:28.428 --> 10:29.229
Jeez.

10:29.329 --> 10:31.131
What a grump.

10:31.231 --> 10:33.000
Yeah, I don't know
what got into him.

10:33.100 --> 10:34.802
I mean, the opportunity
to kiss your butt

10:34.902 --> 10:36.603
doesn't come along every day.

10:36.704 --> 10:38.271
I was joking.

10:38.371 --> 10:39.206
I was fooling around.

10:39.306 --> 10:40.674
I'll apologize.

10:40.774 --> 10:43.343
No, no, no, no, no.

10:43.443 --> 10:46.914
Listen, you want to
make it up to him?

10:47.014 --> 10:48.381
Just write them a
check for $1,500.

10:48.481 --> 10:49.516
Oh, you're kidding.

10:49.616 --> 10:50.984
He's not going to take my check.
- Yes, he will.

10:51.084 --> 10:51.952
Trust me.

10:52.052 --> 10:54.321
Just make it out
to Roseanne Conner.

10:58.358 --> 11:00.728
[music playing]

11:08.235 --> 11:09.602
DJ: (SHOUTING) Aaah, Mom!

11:09.703 --> 11:11.071
Darlene hit me!

11:11.171 --> 11:13.073
DARLENE: I didn't touch you!

11:13.173 --> 11:14.541
I didn't push you!

11:14.641 --> 11:15.542
DJ: Ow!

11:15.642 --> 11:16.676
There's no place like home.

11:16.777 --> 11:19.012
There's no place like home.

11:19.112 --> 11:20.447
There's no place like home.

11:20.547 --> 11:21.849
[kids yelling]
- Mom?

11:21.949 --> 11:22.750
Mom!

11:22.850 --> 11:24.417
Damn.

11:24.517 --> 11:25.552
She hit me!

11:25.652 --> 11:27.654
I caught him peeking
at me getting dressed.

11:27.755 --> 11:29.656
Honey, I told you
to cut that out.

11:29.757 --> 11:32.760
Told me to stop
peeking at Becky.

11:32.860 --> 11:36.797
Well, he's got
me there, Darlene.

11:36.897 --> 11:37.998
What's going on?

11:38.098 --> 11:41.268
Well, now the little
pervert's peeking at me.

11:41.368 --> 11:43.136
Why?

11:43.236 --> 11:44.738
Look, if was
fine for everybody

11:44.838 --> 11:46.206
when he was peeking at Becky.

11:46.306 --> 11:48.208
But now someone may get hurt.

11:48.308 --> 11:49.877
DJ: (YELLING) No!

11:49.977 --> 11:50.778
Hey, come here.

11:50.878 --> 11:51.678
Darlene, go away.

11:56.016 --> 11:57.450
Darlene called me a pre-vert.

12:00.320 --> 12:01.822
No, you're not
a pre-vert, honey.

12:01.922 --> 12:02.722
You're a pervert.

12:08.829 --> 12:10.330
But you're not even that.

12:10.430 --> 12:12.065
You're just growing
up, and you're curious.

12:12.165 --> 12:14.367
But now, you don't like
people walking in on you when

12:14.467 --> 12:16.003
you're getting undressed,
and your sisters

12:16.103 --> 12:17.437
feel the very same way.

12:17.537 --> 12:21.041
Does Daddy see you naked?

12:21.141 --> 12:23.076
Yeah, but it's different
for married people.

12:23.176 --> 12:26.713
You know, married people
have to see each other naked.

12:26.814 --> 12:27.781
Knock, knock.

12:27.881 --> 12:29.582
Anybody home?
Hey, Rosie.

12:29.682 --> 12:31.118
Hi, Arnie, I'll
be right with you.

12:31.218 --> 12:33.686
So you just need to
respect your sisters'

12:33.787 --> 12:35.889
privacy a little bit more, OK?

12:35.989 --> 12:36.790
OK.

12:36.890 --> 12:37.791
All right.

12:37.891 --> 12:39.993
Or else one of them's
gonna kill you.

12:40.093 --> 12:42.195
Why don't you go up
and get ready for bed?

12:42.295 --> 12:45.065
OK.

12:45.165 --> 12:45.966
Kid's a peeper, huh?

12:48.735 --> 12:49.669
Boy, that takes me back.

12:56.076 --> 12:57.444
What, you've got sisters too?

12:57.544 --> 12:58.345
I wish.

13:02.215 --> 13:03.550
Here, this is for you.

13:03.650 --> 13:05.085
It's kind of a thank you thing.

13:05.185 --> 13:06.319
Oh.

13:06.419 --> 13:07.921
I'll take it out in the kitchen.

13:08.021 --> 13:09.622
Hope you don't have
one of those already.

13:09.722 --> 13:14.928
Uh, no, Arnie, I don't
have a wine and soap basket.

13:15.028 --> 13:17.097
I got it at the car wash.

13:21.434 --> 13:26.339
So, uh, did you get Nancy
her little surprise yet?

13:26.439 --> 13:27.240
Sure did.

13:27.340 --> 13:28.308
ROSEANNE: She like it?

13:28.408 --> 13:29.309
You bet.

13:29.409 --> 13:30.677
So she's gonna keep it, huh?

13:30.777 --> 13:33.513
ARNIE: Well, there's no way
she can take it back, Roseanne.

13:33.613 --> 13:35.282
OK, well, like,
what if there was,

13:35.382 --> 13:37.918
like, a really, really
good reason, you know?

13:38.018 --> 13:40.287
I mean, you know
it's just a ring.

13:40.387 --> 13:41.922
Oh, I didn't buy her a ring.

13:42.022 --> 13:44.724
Then what did you do
with the money we lent you?

13:44.824 --> 13:46.927
I got her one of those
breast augmentation deals.

13:50.597 --> 13:51.498
Huh?

13:51.598 --> 13:53.400
You know.

13:53.500 --> 13:56.769
(YELLING) You
got her a boob job?

13:56.870 --> 13:58.371
Yeah, two of 'em.

13:58.471 --> 14:00.540
It's what she wanted.

14:00.640 --> 14:03.543
We gave you $1,500 for that?

14:03.643 --> 14:05.512
Oh, actually, it costs $3
grand and I only had half.

14:05.612 --> 14:07.214
So I borrowed
$1,500 from you guys

14:07.314 --> 14:08.115
so she didn't walk crooked.

14:14.687 --> 14:17.690
Which one is ours?

14:17.790 --> 14:18.658
Hey, Arnie.

14:18.758 --> 14:21.094
Dan, buddy.

14:21.194 --> 14:24.731
Oh, Danny?

14:24.831 --> 14:26.633
DAN: Yes?

14:26.733 --> 14:30.070
There's a couple things
we need to talk about.

14:30.170 --> 14:31.471
Like what?

14:31.571 --> 14:34.107
Oh, like Nancy's
engagement presents.

14:40.080 --> 14:41.381
Please tell me you
got her a camera.

14:46.553 --> 14:48.488
No, but we did help
with the developing.

14:52.059 --> 14:52.926
You bought her--

14:53.026 --> 14:56.129
It's the gift that
keeps on giving.

14:56.229 --> 14:57.998
Neat, huh?

14:58.098 --> 15:00.000
Thought you were going
to give her a ring.

15:00.100 --> 15:00.900
Dan, she's got rings.

15:04.437 --> 15:07.640
Arn-- hang-- hang out here.

15:07.740 --> 15:09.576
Finish your beer.

15:09.676 --> 15:10.477
Honey?

15:10.577 --> 15:11.511
Honey?

15:11.611 --> 15:14.281
Honey?

15:14.381 --> 15:15.648
I thought it was for a ring.

15:15.748 --> 15:17.050
Well, it ain't.

15:17.150 --> 15:18.851
And you know, I think he
ought to pay us interest

15:18.952 --> 15:20.620
on the money we lent him.
- Well, that wasn't the deal.

15:20.720 --> 15:21.921
Well, so what?

15:22.022 --> 15:23.090
We have to pay interest to
the bank on account of him.

15:23.190 --> 15:24.091
Well, what if he can't pay?

15:24.191 --> 15:26.459
What are we going
to do, repossess?

15:26.559 --> 15:27.894
Yeah, and then we'll
give them to Darlene

15:27.995 --> 15:29.062
so DJ has something to look at.

15:42.042 --> 15:44.511
Yep, I'm still here.

15:44.611 --> 15:46.546
Did you hear what we said?

15:46.646 --> 15:49.416
No, I missed the part
about charging me interest.

15:49.516 --> 15:50.450
I'm sorry, Roseanne.

15:50.550 --> 15:51.584
If I'd known this
was going to happen,

15:51.684 --> 15:53.453
I would've told you
I got her a ring.

15:53.553 --> 15:55.688
Yeah, I know that, Arnie.

15:55.788 --> 15:57.424
But it doesn't matter
anyway, because I already

15:57.524 --> 15:58.691
borrowed the money from Jackie.

15:58.791 --> 16:00.693
I just didn't tell
him about it yet.

16:00.793 --> 16:01.628
Oh.

16:01.728 --> 16:03.130
I don't think you
want to do that.

16:03.230 --> 16:04.431
Why not?
It's my family.

16:04.531 --> 16:05.332
It's my house.

16:05.432 --> 16:06.233
I got a right.

16:06.333 --> 16:08.368
Absolutely, you do.

16:08.468 --> 16:09.936
You just sat here
and said I was wrong.

16:10.037 --> 16:11.304
Well, I don't want
to get you mad at me

16:11.404 --> 16:14.007
because I owe you money.

16:14.107 --> 16:17.044
But wouldn't it be better
if I gave Dan a check?

16:17.144 --> 16:19.646
Your check ain't worth squat.

16:19.746 --> 16:20.880
Well, everybody knows that.

16:20.980 --> 16:24.417
But if you give me Jackie's
check, I can cover it.

16:24.517 --> 16:26.486
Well, this is just another
stupid guy thing, isn't it,

16:26.586 --> 16:27.587
Arnie?

16:27.687 --> 16:28.988
Yeah, but this way,
Dan'll be OK with it.

16:29.089 --> 16:31.124
See, if he gets the money
from the bank or from me,

16:31.224 --> 16:32.859
he's taking care of his family.

16:32.959 --> 16:33.993
But if it comes
from Jackie, she's

16:34.094 --> 16:37.097
taking care of his family.
Follow me, here.

16:37.197 --> 16:40.067
It's like I didn't tell Nancy
I borrowed the money from Dan.

16:40.167 --> 16:42.135
I didn't want her to think
that these are Dan's boobs.

16:45.872 --> 16:48.475
Oh, we're out of beer, honey?

16:48.575 --> 16:50.210
I'm gonna go get some.
You want to come, Arn?

16:50.310 --> 16:51.178
ARNIE: Sure.

16:51.278 --> 16:52.312
OK, baby, I'll
see you in a minute.

16:52.412 --> 16:53.246
ARNIE: Oh, wait a minute, Dan.
I almost forgot.

16:53.346 --> 16:54.447
I got that money for you.
- Arnie!

16:54.547 --> 16:55.815
DAN: I thought you
said six, seven weeks.

16:55.915 --> 16:57.150
Well, it came in a little
sooner than I thought.

16:57.250 --> 16:58.118
Let me write you a check.

16:58.218 --> 16:59.552
Wait a minute, Arnie.

16:59.652 --> 17:01.221
Where did he get the money
from, all of a sudden?

17:01.321 --> 17:03.390
Hey, I was at the track and I
saw a horse named Lucky Arnie.

17:03.490 --> 17:04.591
- Dan--
- That's right.

17:04.691 --> 17:05.492
It was Lucky Dan.

17:05.592 --> 17:07.660
It was a long shot, 300-to-1.

17:07.760 --> 17:08.761
Arnie.

17:08.861 --> 17:10.397
Lucky Arnie, Lucky
Dan-- work with me here.

17:16.303 --> 17:17.337
Why are you friends with him?

17:20.006 --> 17:23.376
OK, I just took the
money from Jackie myself.

17:23.476 --> 17:25.478
DAN: You took a check
from your sister?

17:25.578 --> 17:26.713
Well, I'm outta here.

17:29.649 --> 17:31.418
Hey, enjoy the soap.

17:31.518 --> 17:33.120
Give it back, Roseanne.

17:33.220 --> 17:34.421
I got a right.

17:34.521 --> 17:35.422
It's my family, too.

17:35.522 --> 17:36.423
You're not doing this.

17:36.523 --> 17:37.490
I said no.

17:37.590 --> 17:39.426
And I said I'm taking
my sister's check.

17:39.526 --> 17:40.327
Yeah?

17:40.427 --> 17:41.394
Well, what do you think of this?

17:47.234 --> 17:50.603
(SHOUTING) Where
the hell is that tape?

17:50.703 --> 17:53.039
[music playing]

18:01.047 --> 18:01.914
Hey.

18:02.014 --> 18:03.916
Hi, Dan.

18:04.016 --> 18:05.118
What you up to?

18:05.218 --> 18:06.953
I'm just waiting for Gary.
You?

18:07.053 --> 18:08.388
Running away from home.

18:08.488 --> 18:09.956
Buy you a drink?

18:10.056 --> 18:12.559
No, let me buy.

18:12.659 --> 18:13.993
Yeah, I'll have a beer.

18:14.093 --> 18:14.894
Hey, Willie?

18:14.994 --> 18:15.928
Couple beers, please?

18:16.028 --> 18:16.829
Uh, coming up.

18:16.929 --> 18:17.897
Thanks, buddy.

18:17.997 --> 18:19.732
Oh.

18:19.832 --> 18:20.967
Things are good
with you and Gary?

18:21.067 --> 18:22.569
Yeah, great.
Yeah.

18:22.669 --> 18:23.703
You and Roseanne?

18:23.803 --> 18:27.707
Well, tore up your check.

18:27.807 --> 18:29.309
What's keeping Gary?

18:29.409 --> 18:31.411
Look, Jackie, I know you
were only trying to help,

18:31.511 --> 18:33.012
and I was little tough
on you, so I'm sorry.

18:33.112 --> 18:33.980
No, I had it coming.

18:34.080 --> 18:35.248
Yeah.

18:35.348 --> 18:37.917
But Dan, all these years,
I've been eating your food

18:38.017 --> 18:39.852
and using your washing
machine and making

18:39.952 --> 18:42.855
long distance calls on the--

18:42.955 --> 18:44.257
that's not important.

18:44.357 --> 18:45.825
But I just figured that I--

18:45.925 --> 18:47.860
I want to pay you back a little.

18:47.960 --> 18:49.229
Well, I appreciate it, Jackie.

18:49.329 --> 18:53.433
But I've borrowed money from
relatives before, and trust me,

18:53.533 --> 18:55.067
it never works out.

18:55.168 --> 18:56.169
Oh, I agree.

18:56.269 --> 18:58.070
Remember who lent me
money for my first car?

18:58.171 --> 18:59.606
You're welcome.

18:59.706 --> 19:00.973
"Don't worry, Jackie.

19:01.073 --> 19:03.476
I'll take shopping and find
you a nice solid transportation

19:03.576 --> 19:04.811
vehicle."

19:04.911 --> 19:07.880
"But gee, Dan, I don't want
a nice solid transportation

19:07.980 --> 19:09.249
vehicle.

19:09.349 --> 19:11.251
I want a shiny new piece of
crap that looks good and goes,

19:11.351 --> 19:12.151
vroom, vroom!"

19:12.252 --> 19:13.353
Well, I did!

19:13.453 --> 19:14.587
Don't

19:14.687 --> 19:17.324
Oh, I know.

19:17.424 --> 19:19.259
I know.

19:19.359 --> 19:21.894
Yeah, I remember back when me
and Rosie was getting started,

19:21.994 --> 19:24.864
and well, we wanted
to buy the house.

19:24.964 --> 19:27.567
And I had to borrow the
money from her folks--

19:27.667 --> 19:29.236
your folks.

19:29.336 --> 19:34.207
14 years ago, and I still have
to pretend that I like them.

19:34.307 --> 19:37.076
Same here.

19:37.176 --> 19:40.380
So then-- well,
neither one of us will

19:40.480 --> 19:41.748
ever borrow from family again.

19:41.848 --> 19:42.682
Here.

19:42.782 --> 19:43.650
[clink]

19:47.620 --> 19:49.155
But you'd borrow
from a friend, right?

19:49.256 --> 19:50.390
Sure, sure.

19:50.490 --> 19:52.692
Well, Dan, I don't think
of you just as family.

19:52.792 --> 19:54.427
I think of you as a friend

19:54.527 --> 19:57.397
Aw, Jackie, I think
of you as family.

19:57.497 --> 19:59.198
Aw, come on, Dan.

19:59.299 --> 20:04.103
It'd make me feel so good
if I could help you guys out

20:04.203 --> 20:05.004
Yeah.

20:07.740 --> 20:08.841
You're my friend, huh?

20:08.941 --> 20:11.278
Absolutely.

20:11.378 --> 20:12.979
Sure you got
this kind of money?

20:13.079 --> 20:14.180
All you gotta do is ask.

20:18.485 --> 20:21.588
You got it, pal!

20:21.688 --> 20:24.056
[music playing]

20:31.130 --> 20:33.533
Hey.

20:33.633 --> 20:35.602
Where you been?

20:35.702 --> 20:37.670
Having a drink with a friend.

20:37.770 --> 20:39.439
Oh boy.

20:39.539 --> 20:43.310
I love a man who
knows when to cave.

20:43.410 --> 20:44.644
Oh, are you kidding?

20:44.744 --> 20:46.178
She begged me.

20:46.279 --> 20:48.281
What are you doing?

20:48.381 --> 20:51.518
Oh, Nancy's picture here?

20:51.618 --> 20:52.852
It's like they follow you.

21:05.498 --> 21:08.501
You know, you're
right, it's eerie.

21:08.601 --> 21:09.536
There was a bunch of these.

21:09.636 --> 21:10.703
We shouldn't leave
them laying around.

21:10.803 --> 21:12.071
Where's the other ones.

21:12.171 --> 21:13.373
I thought you had them.

21:13.473 --> 21:15.141
What do I need them
for, proof of purchase?

21:18.545 --> 21:19.946
DJ!
