{\an1}Here I was feeling guilty
for deceiving you

01:57.951 --> 02:00.161
{\an1}when you knew all along
I wasn't French.

02:00.245 --> 02:01.996
{\an3}Well, maybe
not all along.

02:02.080 --> 02:03.414

I'm really glad

{\an3}you turned out to be a

02:08.919 --> 02:10.295

02:10.380 --> 02:13.216
missing your plane, and staying

{\an1}What do you think
of sleeping on the beach?

03:25.538 --> 03:28.958
{\an3}Well, I think ordering
that shooting star

03:29.042 --> 03:29.834
was a little over the top,

03:29.918 --> 03:33.254
but other than that,
it was pretty cool.

even better.

03:36.174 --> 03:37.467

cross that line.

03:37.550 --> 03:40.261
What are you saying?

03:40.345 --> 03:42.472
Because we didn't have sex,
nothing happened?

03:42.555 --> 03:45.058
Who fell asleep
in my arms last night?

03:45.600 --> 03:49.187
I admit it: we did connect...

03:49.270 --> 03:52.357
but we both know
how much you love Brenda.

03:52.440 --> 03:54.817

last night?

03:54.901 --> 03:56.361
Am I talking about her
right now?

03:56.444 --> 03:59.280
I am, and you should be.

03:59.364 --> 04:00.615
Okay, fine,

04:00.698 --> 04:02.367
but can you honestly look me
in the eye and tell me

04:02.450 --> 04:05.161
that we have not become more

04:05.244 --> 04:06.955
than just "good friends"
this summer?

04:07.038 --> 04:09.165
What do you want to do, Dylan?

04:09.248 --> 04:10.375
Do you want to make love
so we can prove

04:10.458 --> 04:12.502
that I have become once again
the class bimbo?

04:12.585 --> 04:17.005
How can you use the words
"make love"

04:17.089 --> 04:18.966
and "bimbo"
in the same sentence?

04:21.135 --> 04:25.223
{\an3}Look, just play it out
with me, okay?

04:25.306 --> 04:26.224
{\an1}Yeah.

04:26.307 --> 04:27.976
{\an3}I mean how are we
going to feel

04:28.059 --> 04:28.810
when Brenda comes
home and asks us

04:28.893 --> 04:32.021
{\an3}what we've been
doing all summer?

04:32.105 --> 04:33.356
Come on, guys.

04:33.439 --> 04:35.191
There's some great shells
over here. Look.

Hi.

04:48.121 --> 04:49.872
Um, what're you doing
so far from the club?

04:49.956 --> 04:50.873
We're collecting shells

04:52.125 --> 04:53.042
{\an3}Oh, great.

last night.

{\an1}Uh, you guys, come on.
Let's go over here, okay?

There's some good
shells over there.

Come on.
The best shells.

There you go.

05:08.558 --> 05:09.892
"Kevin"?

05:09.976 --> 05:11.436
I had to think fast.

05:11.519 --> 05:16.482
See, that's exactly
what I'm talking about.

05:16.566 --> 05:20.069
I've worked too hard
to change my reputation

05:20.153 --> 05:22.322
to start sneaking around now.

05:22.405 --> 05:24.240
What do you want me to do,
Kelly, huh?

05:24.323 --> 05:26.367
You want me
to tell Brenda about us?

05:26.451 --> 05:27.785
{\an3}There's nothing
to tell her, okay?

05:27.869 --> 05:30.371
{\an3}We watched <i> Casablanca.</i>
We saw some stars.

05:30.455 --> 05:31.247
{\an3}That's it.

05:31.330 --> 05:34.375
Whatever gets you
through the night.

05:36.335 --> 05:38.296
If things were different, Dylan,

05:38.379 --> 05:39.005
maybe we could have something,

05:39.088 --> 05:42.300
{\an3}but Brenda's
my best friend.

05:42.383 --> 05:45.553
When she gets off that plane
tonight you're going to remember

05:45.636 --> 05:48.931
exactly why you fell in love
with her in the first place.

05:50.975 --> 05:56.105
Dylan, you and I had what we had
this summer, okay?

05:56.189 --> 06:02.320
I just think that has to be
enough for both of us.

06:03.529 --> 06:06.282
What are you telling me?

06:06.365 --> 06:08.076
We'll always have Paris?

06:09.869 --> 06:12.080
Thanks for not doing
a Bogart imitation.

What? The beat's jamming.

06:20.046 --> 06:22.131
{\an3}You want me to stop it
for a bridge?

06:22.215 --> 06:23.299
{\an1}David, it needs
something.

06:23.382 --> 06:25.301
{\an1}Maybe we should go back
to the chorus.

06:25.384 --> 06:26.677

fine the way it is.

to be your manager,

to start listening to me.

we were leaving,

10:26.459 --> 10:29.295
I met this really cute guy
from the University of Wisconsin

10:29.378 --> 10:32.173

that I was French.

10:32.256 --> 10:34.675

He was completely fooled,
<i>mon cherie.</i>

10:38.804 --> 10:40.765
Oh! What happened?

10:40.848 --> 10:45.394
Well, he wanted me to go
backpacking with him...

10:45.478 --> 10:47.396
and I came really close
to doing it,

10:47.480 --> 10:48.856
but instead

10:48.939 --> 10:49.899
I turned around
and went to the airport

10:49.982 --> 10:52.026
and never even said good-bye.

10:52.109 --> 10:53.569
Wow.

10:53.652 --> 10:56.906
You know, part of me just wanted
to take off with him,

10:56.989 --> 11:00.951
but I kept thinking
about how much I love Dylan,

11:01.035 --> 11:02.536
and I just couldn't.

11:04.330 --> 11:06.749

11:23.516 --> 11:27.728
{\an1}Dylan, thanks for coming
at such short notice.

11:27.812 --> 11:28.854
Thanks for calling.

11:37.363 --> 11:38.906
I remember you.

11:38.989 --> 11:39.949
Dylan!

11:42.410 --> 11:45.121
Hey!
Hi.

11:51.377 --> 11:52.586
(giggles)

11:57.383 --> 11:59.051
{\an3}So what's going on at
the Beach Club tomorrow?

11:59.135 --> 12:02.304
{\an1}Ah, it's going to be an
authentic New England clambake

12:02.388 --> 12:04.098
followed by a big dance.

12:04.181 --> 12:07.268
Which I won't be playing at.

12:07.351 --> 12:10.229
And don't forget the sandcastle-
building contest tomorrow.

12:15.359 --> 12:16.652
Ciao, guys.

12:16.735 --> 12:17.153
Bye-bye.

12:17.236 --> 12:18.821
Hey, Steve, wait up.

12:18.904 --> 12:21.115
Bye, guys.

12:21.198 --> 12:23.784
{\an3}I'll see you
tomorrow, handsome.

12:24.034 --> 12:27.121
I think I'll walk you
out to your car.

12:27.204 --> 12:28.456
Bye...

12:31.417 --> 12:33.335
Okay, you stay here.

12:33.419 --> 12:34.253
Unless you already have plans.

12:36.255 --> 12:36.964
{\an3}Hey, Kelly, can you
hang for a while?

12:37.047 --> 12:40.050
No, I'm the chauffeur tonight.

12:40.134 --> 12:42.219
Okay, I'll see
you tomorrow.

12:42.303 --> 12:43.220
Okay...

12:43.304 --> 12:44.346
{\an1}DYLAN:
Night, Kel.

12:44.930 --> 12:47.766
Yeah, good night.

12:49.268 --> 12:52.730
{\an3}So why don't we go in the
kitchen and clean up.

12:52.813 --> 12:54.565
Okay.

13:05.075 --> 13:07.703
{\an1}I thought we're supposed
to be cleaning up.

13:07.786 --> 13:10.372
Aren't we?

13:10.456 --> 13:11.999
{\an1}Bren, I got a
confession to make.

13:12.082 --> 13:14.543
While you were in France,

13:14.627 --> 13:16.712
{\an1}I almost forgot
what you were like.

13:16.795 --> 13:18.088
{\an3}Well, is it
coming back to you?

13:18.172 --> 13:21.091
It's getting there.

13:21.175 --> 13:23.093
I brought you something.

13:31.185 --> 13:33.229
Oh, Bren,

13:33.312 --> 13:35.397
that's great.

13:35.481 --> 13:37.399
{\an1}It's for your watch chain.
Read the back.

13:40.444 --> 13:42.863
<i>"Je t'aime, Brenda."</i>

13:45.824 --> 13:48.577
{\an1}I really, really wish we could
go back to your house,

13:48.661 --> 13:50.538
{\an1}but I don't think it's
the smartest thing to do

13:50.621 --> 13:53.624
{\an1}considering it's my
first night back.

13:53.707 --> 13:55.751
{\an5}I should've gotten
you something.
Dylan, why?

13:55.834 --> 13:57.294
{\an1}You didn't go anywhere
this summer.

13:57.378 --> 13:59.171
<i>Je t'aime aussi, Brenda.</i>

14:07.388 --> 14:08.764
Did everyone leave?

14:10.307 --> 14:12.393
{\an1}Yeah, they all said goodbye,
and everybody

14:12.476 --> 14:14.395
said thank you for the party
and everything.

14:14.478 --> 14:15.729
{\an3}Well, I'm glad
they enjoyed themselves.

14:15.813 --> 14:18.732
I'm glad you're home.

14:19.233 --> 14:21.402
{\an1}Mom, Dad,

14:21.485 --> 14:24.488
{\an1}it really meant a lot to Dylan
that you let him come over.

14:24.572 --> 14:26.949
{\an1}And it meant
a lot to me, too.

14:27.032 --> 14:31.287
You know, I did a lot of
thinking over the summer

14:31.370 --> 14:33.122
and you guys were right.

14:33.205 --> 14:35.374
Things have to change.

14:36.792 --> 14:38.127
I mean I love Dylan,

14:38.210 --> 14:39.962
but I'm not willing
to lose you guys

14:40.045 --> 14:41.213
just to make
some kind of a point.

14:42.881 --> 14:45.134
And I really want to be
a part of this family.

14:45.217 --> 14:48.095
We love you too, sweetheart.

14:49.930 --> 14:53.017
Maybe you weren't the only one
who grew up this summer.

14:53.100 --> 14:55.144
Hey...

14:55.227 --> 14:57.187
I don't know how I'm ever going
to be able to thank you guys

14:57.271 --> 14:58.314
for sending me to Paris.

14:58.397 --> 14:59.273
You already did, sweetheart.

15:02.234 --> 15:03.819
Good night.

15:03.902 --> 15:05.613
{\an1}Good night.
Good night, honey.

15:12.202 --> 15:14.163
(knocking)

15:14.246 --> 15:16.206
{\an1}You gonna be
much longer, sis?

15:16.290 --> 15:18.167
Yeah, two seconds.

15:18.250 --> 15:21.045
{\an6}Okay.
Hey, you're wearing
the sweatshirt.

15:21.128 --> 15:23.172
{\an1}Yeah, it's already
one of my favorites.

15:23.255 --> 15:24.715
Thanks.

15:26.258 --> 15:28.177
Do you smell smoke?

15:28.260 --> 15:31.347
No... but I'm really
stuffed up from the flight.

15:31.430 --> 15:33.140
And I'm still on Paris time.

15:33.223 --> 15:35.851
So, it went great over there,
or what?

15:35.934 --> 15:38.103
Yeah.

15:38.187 --> 15:40.064
So how was it being home alone
with Mom and Dad?

15:40.147 --> 15:43.525
Well, with you gone, they kind
of lost their taste for battle.

15:43.609 --> 15:45.527
Oh, it was cool, you know.
They did their thing.

15:45.611 --> 15:47.237
I did mine: I worked,
hung out with Brooke.

15:47.321 --> 15:49.281
Yeah, she's something else.

15:49.365 --> 15:50.532
You didn't like her?

15:50.616 --> 15:53.035
No. I think she's great.
I'm really happy for you.

15:53.118 --> 15:56.413
She smart; she's athletic;
she gets along with everybody...

15:56.497 --> 15:57.748
But...

15:59.333 --> 16:00.501
I don't know.

16:00.584 --> 16:03.253
I can't put my finger on it,
but something's off, you know?

16:03.337 --> 16:06.256
So does this mean
we're not going out

16:06.340 --> 16:07.299
on a double date next week?

16:07.383 --> 16:09.134
We'll see.

16:10.135 --> 16:11.053
So, is it weird being back?

16:11.136 --> 16:13.931
{\an3}You know the French
have this saying,

16:14.014 --> 16:18.268
"The more things change,
the more they remain the same."

16:18.352 --> 16:20.187
It's weird. Somehow I feel
like I haven't even left.

16:20.270 --> 16:21.730
So we can expect Dad and Dylan

16:21.814 --> 16:22.898
to go another ten
rounds this year?

16:22.981 --> 16:25.109
{\an3}Fortunately, I think
that's changed.

16:25.192 --> 16:26.860
Good.

16:26.944 --> 16:28.904
{\an5}Hey, listen, let me know
when you're done, okay?
Okay.

16:28.987 --> 16:30.781
Oh, Brandon,

16:30.864 --> 16:31.740
the next time I go to France,

16:31.824 --> 16:33.992
you're definitely gonna
have to go with me.

16:34.076 --> 16:36.286
{\an1}You know, I was just thinking
that exact same thing.

16:36.370 --> 16:39.164
{\an1}Must be one of those
twin things.

16:47.172 --> 16:49.425
(knocking)

16:49.508 --> 16:51.093
Kelly, you okay?

16:51.176 --> 16:52.302
{\an3}You seemed a little
weirded out at the party.

16:52.386 --> 16:54.304
Do you think Brenda noticed?

16:54.388 --> 16:57.307
No, no one did.

16:57.391 --> 17:00.519
You did.

17:00.602 --> 17:03.647
{\an1}Well, that's because I saw
you and Dylan together.

17:03.731 --> 17:08.152
What if Dylan decides
to tell Brenda the truth?

17:08.234 --> 17:10.695
Don't worry.
He's not that stupid.

17:10.779 --> 17:12.281
So you're not gonna tell Donna

17:12.364 --> 17:13.240
about that girl
you fooled around with?

17:13.323 --> 17:16.617
Well, that's different;
I mean, you know,

17:16.702 --> 17:18.119
Nikki wasn't Donna's best friend
in the world.

17:18.203 --> 17:20.455
Thank you.

17:20.539 --> 17:21.623
{\an1}I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it that way.

17:21.707 --> 17:23.791
Look, just forget about it.

17:23.876 --> 17:25.169
It'll blow over. You'll see.

17:25.252 --> 17:28.005
Good night, David.

17:28.088 --> 17:30.257
Good night.

17:39.850 --> 17:42.644
Some best friend.

17:56.408 --> 17:58.827
BRANDON:
We're way overmatched here.

17:58.911 --> 18:00.078
You know that.

18:00.162 --> 18:02.831
Oh, come on, Brandon, these guys
are professional architects.

18:02.915 --> 18:03.791
Of course, we can't
compete with them.

18:03.874 --> 18:06.210
{\an3}That's why they're
in their own division.

18:06.293 --> 18:09.379
Ah.

18:09.463 --> 18:15.636
{\an1}Uh, still, I'm no good at
this sand sculpture thingy...

18:15.719 --> 18:17.846
{\an1}To tell you the truth,
it's my first time.

18:17.930 --> 18:19.014
Oh...

18:19.097 --> 18:20.390
{\an3}a virgin.

18:21.934 --> 18:23.685
Seriously,

18:23.769 --> 18:26.688
{\an3}If we can't beat sister Brenda
and Andrea and the kiddies

18:26.772 --> 18:29.024
{\an3}and whoever else,
we're pretty sorry stuff.

18:29.107 --> 18:31.318
Okay, but you're gonna
have to carry the team.

18:31.401 --> 18:34.071
Hey, I've got work to do.

18:35.906 --> 18:38.200
Okay, if you're busy...

18:38.283 --> 18:40.911
I'm sure Steve wouldn't mind

18:40.994 --> 18:42.162
getting into the wet sand
with me.

18:42.246 --> 18:42.454
Hey!

18:48.836 --> 18:49.503
Give me those lips, honey.

18:49.586 --> 18:52.506
{\an3}Oh, I thought
you'd never ask.

18:57.803 --> 19:00.597
{\an3}Wow, she's in to your brother
something fierce.

19:00.681 --> 19:04.017
Yeah. So you noticed.

19:04.101 --> 19:05.185
Hey, don't...

19:05.269 --> 19:07.729
(shovels clang)

19:07.813 --> 19:08.939
That's good, Cheryl.

19:09.022 --> 19:11.859
{\an4}Don't forget to pack
the sand with water,
okay, and then...

19:11.942 --> 19:13.861
Not now, Cameron, okay?

19:13.944 --> 19:15.070
What?

19:16.363 --> 19:21.076
{\an3}I know the Batmobile
was your idea,

19:21.159 --> 19:25.247
{\an3}but, but I have to help
the other kids, too,

19:25.330 --> 19:27.708
okay? All right.

19:27.791 --> 19:30.377
Oh, that's good.
Try this part...

19:33.005 --> 19:35.090
Oh, sand is definitely
not good for my nails.

19:35.173 --> 19:37.926
Okay, make room for the expert.

19:38.010 --> 19:39.469
Now ladies, don't you think

19:39.553 --> 19:41.388
if you're going to be sculpting
France, you ought to have a map.

19:41.471 --> 19:43.974
{\an1}BRENDA:
Wow, thanks.

19:44.057 --> 19:46.935
I never thought you'd want
to help in a million years.

19:47.019 --> 19:48.312
Come on. I'm into it.

19:48.395 --> 19:49.813
You are?

19:49.897 --> 19:52.274
Yeah, I am.

19:54.192 --> 19:56.778
Oh great, we're gonna get
a lot of work done here.

19:56.862 --> 19:59.239
Where are David and Kelly
when you really need them?

20:00.157 --> 20:01.658
JACKIE:
<i>Kelly, please,</i>

20:01.742 --> 20:03.785
{\an1}I've been cooped up
in the house all summer.

20:03.869 --> 20:05.245
{\an1}Besides, it's Erin's
coming out party.

20:05.329 --> 20:06.747
I'm sorry. You go.

20:06.830 --> 20:09.291
{\an3}I just don't feel like doing
that whole club thing tonight.

20:09.374 --> 20:11.460
Dad wanted me to tell you
the car's all packed up,

20:11.543 --> 20:12.628
and he's ready to go.

20:12.711 --> 20:14.421
{\an1}What is it, honey?
Is it Jake?

20:14.504 --> 20:15.964
Are you still upset about him?

20:16.048 --> 20:17.049
Mother, please.

20:17.132 --> 20:19.801
What did I say? I'm just trying
to understand you.

20:19.885 --> 20:20.928
Then why can't you understand

20:21.011 --> 20:21.470
that I just feel
like staying home?

20:21.553 --> 20:24.514
Fine, it's your loss.

20:24.598 --> 20:26.642
{\an1}Listen, will you
tell your Dad

20:26.725 --> 20:27.809
I'll be just a minute.

20:31.063 --> 20:32.856
{\an1}Listen, Kel, uh,
you're going to have

20:32.940 --> 20:35.484
{\an1}to talk to Brenda again
sooner or later.

20:35.567 --> 20:36.818
I talked to her last night.

20:36.902 --> 20:39.488
That's why I just...
I don't want to go.

20:39.571 --> 20:43.200
{\an1}So you and Dylan kissed
in the cabana once, big deal.

20:43.283 --> 20:45.619
You said nothing
happened, right?

20:45.702 --> 20:47.204
Right, nothing happened.

20:47.287 --> 20:48.830
{\an1}Then quit torturing yourself,
put on some sunblock

20:48.914 --> 20:50.207
{\an1}and let's go down
to the beach

20:50.290 --> 20:51.833
and spend the last day of summer
with our friends.

20:51.917 --> 20:54.294
{\an1}Besides...

20:54.378 --> 20:55.629
if you keep moping around,

20:55.712 --> 20:57.756
{\an1}people are gonna start
getting suspicious.

21:08.600 --> 21:11.520
{\an1}I'm telling you,
that isn't Vaucresson.

21:11.603 --> 21:14.022
Donna, it is.
I'm positive.

21:14.106 --> 21:16.817
{\an1}You're wrong.
Look at the map.

21:16.900 --> 21:19.361
{\an3}Then Rick's wrong because
that's what he told me it was.

21:19.444 --> 21:20.612
Who's Rick?

21:23.615 --> 21:26.702
{\an3}Uh, Rick was our
tour guide in France.

21:26.785 --> 21:28.412
He must've been pretty good.

21:28.495 --> 21:29.705
Why do you say that?

21:29.788 --> 21:32.582
Well, he knew
where Vaucresson was.

21:44.011 --> 21:45.554
Cameron, didn't I tell you

21:45.637 --> 21:48.348
{\an3}to stay with Kenny
and the group?

21:52.019 --> 21:52.477
You want to help me?

21:55.313 --> 21:56.565
That's sweet.

21:56.648 --> 21:58.859
{\an3}The best way
for you to help me

21:58.942 --> 22:00.736
is to stay here,

22:00.819 --> 22:03.321
while I go and I fill
up the bucket, okay?

22:09.619 --> 22:11.955
All right, Brooke,
I gotta take off.

22:12.039 --> 22:14.583
{\an1}How can you leave now?
We'll never finish on time?

22:14.666 --> 22:16.251
{\an3}Hey, I warned you I had
to help Henry today.

22:16.334 --> 22:17.461
Oh, come on.

22:17.544 --> 22:20.297
Henry can prep the clambake
by himself.

22:20.380 --> 22:22.591
No, he really can't.
It's just a ton of work.

22:22.674 --> 22:26.636
So let Henry earn his money
for a change.

22:26.720 --> 22:28.597
What's that supposed to mean?

22:28.680 --> 22:30.098
You know what I mean.

22:30.182 --> 22:31.308
No, I don't.

22:31.391 --> 22:33.101
Brandon...

22:33.185 --> 22:35.145
Henry can't be fired.
He's black.

22:36.813 --> 22:38.899
Brooke, for your information,

22:38.982 --> 22:40.442
nobody around here works
as hard as Henry.

22:40.525 --> 22:42.110
And when he's not
busting his ass here,

22:42.194 --> 22:43.445
{\an3}he's rebuilding
his store that was

22:43.528 --> 22:44.821
{\an3}torched by the
looters in the riots,

22:44.905 --> 22:47.282
{\an3}so don't you ever tell me
he slacks off, okay.

22:47.365 --> 22:48.116
Okay, I'm sorry.

22:48.200 --> 22:49.659
I didn't mean
to insult your boss.

22:49.743 --> 22:52.746
He's not just my boss.

22:52.829 --> 22:54.873
He's my friend, too.

22:54.956 --> 22:56.458
All I was trying
to do was get you

22:56.541 --> 22:59.961
{\an3}to stay and play with me
a little while longer.

23:00.045 --> 23:01.797
I didn't mean anything by it.

23:01.880 --> 23:03.131
Really.

23:03.215 --> 23:05.801
Okay.

23:05.884 --> 23:07.135
But I gotta go.

23:07.219 --> 23:08.845
Hey.

23:09.679 --> 23:11.598
{\an3}Want some help
shucking some corn?

23:11.681 --> 23:16.353
{\an1}Well, that would mean
we'd both be abandoning ship.

23:16.436 --> 23:18.438
{\an3}That would mean
we'd both be together.

23:29.366 --> 23:32.285
{\an3}Oh, hi.
Hey.

23:32.369 --> 23:34.996
She is so exquisite.

23:35.080 --> 23:36.665
What took you
guys so long?

23:36.748 --> 23:38.959
{\an1}Well, my sister
had a small crisis.

23:39.042 --> 23:40.669
{\an3}Why, what's wrong
with Erin?

23:40.752 --> 23:42.796
Nothing.

23:45.590 --> 23:47.968
{\an6}(crying)
BRENDA:
She has such beautiful skin.

23:48.051 --> 23:49.344
{\an3}You should've seen her
a couple weeks ago.

23:49.427 --> 23:51.346
{\an3}She practically fit
in the palm of my hand.

23:51.429 --> 23:53.849
{\an6}BRENDA:
You two know
each other?

23:53.932 --> 23:55.392
Uh, yeah.

23:55.475 --> 23:56.893
{\an3}Me and Kelly babysat
one night.

23:56.977 --> 23:58.854
{\an1}You did?

23:58.937 --> 24:00.897
Yeah, he was a natural;
talked her right to sleep.

24:02.274 --> 24:03.817
{\an1}I heard you have
that effect on women.

24:03.900 --> 24:05.527
Not.

24:05.610 --> 24:07.028
{\an3}Honey, everybody's
seen Erin.

24:07.112 --> 24:09.156
{\an5}I think we should head back
to the clubhouse now.
Okay.

24:09.239 --> 24:10.574
Uh, everybody...

24:10.657 --> 24:11.950
open house up at the
Taylor-Silver cabana.

24:14.911 --> 24:15.871
{\an3}Kelly, where
are you going?

24:15.954 --> 24:16.705
Aren't you gonna help us
finish the sculpture?

24:16.788 --> 24:19.708
No, I think I better
stick by my mom.

24:19.791 --> 24:21.710
But I'll see guys later.

24:21.793 --> 24:22.878
{\an3}Bye.

24:22.961 --> 24:23.837
{\an1}Come on.

24:27.299 --> 24:29.843
{\an1}Monsieur McKay,
aren't you coming?

24:29.926 --> 24:31.887
Yeah.

24:36.933 --> 24:38.977
{\an1}Hey, why are you moving
all your equipment?

24:39.060 --> 24:41.271
{\an3}I'm making room in the cabana
for Erin's baby stuff.

24:41.354 --> 24:42.814
Do you need some help?

24:42.898 --> 24:43.732
{\an3}From you?

24:43.815 --> 24:44.691
{\an1}After all,
I'm your manager.

24:44.774 --> 24:46.693
{\an3}Yeah, well,
not for long.

24:46.776 --> 24:48.862
David, I'm sifting
offers as we speak.

24:48.945 --> 24:51.156
Yeah, well, sift this.

24:52.949 --> 24:55.202
You're getting a real artistic
temperament, Silver.

24:55.285 --> 24:56.620
You know that, don't you?

25:03.710 --> 25:06.296
One bushel down, five to go.

25:06.379 --> 25:07.255
{\an1}You know, you're getting
pretty good at this.

25:07.339 --> 25:08.590
We may have just found
a new career for you.

25:08.673 --> 25:09.925
Well, good.

25:10.008 --> 25:11.801
I need to find something to do
with the rest of my life.

25:11.885 --> 25:14.679
Well, let me talk to Henry.
I'll see what I can work out.

25:16.014 --> 25:18.308
{\an3}It must have been really hard
for him to lose his store.

25:18.391 --> 25:20.602
Yeah, watching your life savings
go up in smoke.

25:20.685 --> 25:21.811
I'd say that's
pretty tough.

25:21.895 --> 25:22.771
{\an3}Didn't he put up
a sign or something

25:22.854 --> 25:24.648
like the rest of them?

25:24.731 --> 25:26.900
{\an3}You know,
"Black-owned business"?

25:26.983 --> 25:28.777
{\an1}Brooke, not all
the looters were black.

25:28.860 --> 25:30.570
{\an1}Besides, what difference
does it make?

25:30.654 --> 25:32.072
It makes a lot
of difference.

25:32.155 --> 25:32.948
{\an3}Blacks are against
the Koreans.

25:33.031 --> 25:34.950
{\an3}The Koreans are
against the blacks.

25:35.033 --> 25:37.118
{\an3}And, well, they're
both against us.

25:37.202 --> 25:38.912
I don't believe that.

25:38.995 --> 25:40.580
Well, you can believe
what you want, Brandon,

25:40.664 --> 25:41.790
but the next time
there's a riot in this town,

25:41.873 --> 25:43.959
you better believe they're gonna
come to places like this

25:44.042 --> 25:45.418
for payback time.

25:45.502 --> 25:46.836
What are you getting
so bent out of shape about?

25:46.920 --> 25:49.756
Because every time
I open my mouth these days,

25:49.839 --> 25:50.966
we end up getting into a fight

25:51.049 --> 25:51.967
and I'm sick of it.

25:52.050 --> 25:53.635
Tell me about it. So am I.

25:53.718 --> 25:55.804
Are you intimidated by me?
Is that it?

25:55.887 --> 25:56.846
(scoffs)

25:56.930 --> 25:59.933
I'm a little more secure
than that, Brooke, thanks.

26:00.016 --> 26:02.936
That's what I thought, too.

26:03.019 --> 26:04.896
I thought you were
the perfect guy for me,

26:04.980 --> 26:06.147
{\an3}but lately it's gotten
to the point

26:06.231 --> 26:09.776
where you're embarrassed to kiss
me in front of your friends.

26:09.859 --> 26:10.819
That's not true.

26:10.902 --> 26:12.654
Then what is it, Brandon?

26:12.737 --> 26:14.823
Something is bothering you.

26:14.906 --> 26:17.784
Truthfully, Brooke, yes,
something is bothering me.

26:19.077 --> 26:20.829
You see, I'm a liberal
kind of guy,

26:20.912 --> 26:23.957
and sometimes the things
that come out of your mouth,

26:24.040 --> 26:26.167
the racial slurs, et cetera,

26:26.251 --> 26:27.961
they really drive me up a wall.

26:28.044 --> 26:29.504
{\an3}What are you
saying, Brandon?

26:29.587 --> 26:30.672
That I'm a bigot?

26:30.755 --> 26:31.840
Brooke, I'm...
Because I'm not.

26:31.923 --> 26:33.174
{\an3}I'm a good
person, Brandon,

26:33.258 --> 26:35.302
{\an3}and I don't have to
justify myself to you.

26:35.385 --> 26:36.678
Brooke...
No. Excuse me.

26:36.761 --> 26:37.971
{\an3}I'm going to go finish
building our sand castle

26:38.054 --> 26:41.349
{\an6}and try to have some fun
unless that's not
politically correct!

26:41.433 --> 26:43.351
{\an1}Come on, come on,
come on. I'm sorry.

26:43.435 --> 26:43.935
{\an1}I didn't mean
to hurt your feelings.

26:44.019 --> 26:47.355
Yeah, well...

26:47.439 --> 26:50.191
it's a little late for
that, don't you think?

26:56.448 --> 26:57.824
Kelly, wait up.

26:57.907 --> 26:59.743
{\an1}Hi, Dylan.

26:59.826 --> 27:01.202
You okay?

27:01.286 --> 27:03.371
Course I am.
How are you?

27:03.455 --> 27:05.707
{\an5}(sighs)
Look, I know
this is a little weird...

27:05.790 --> 27:06.875
{\an1}Dylan,

27:06.958 --> 27:09.210
you don't have
to keep going out of your way

27:09.294 --> 27:10.754
to break the ice with me.
I'm fine.

27:10.837 --> 27:11.880
In fact, this is exactly
what I predicted

27:11.963 --> 27:13.882
would happen, now, isn't it?

27:13.965 --> 27:14.883
No, you didn't predict it.

27:14.966 --> 27:16.051
You made it happen.

27:16.134 --> 27:17.010
(sighs)

27:17.093 --> 27:20.013
I'm just looking out
for all of us, okay?

27:20.096 --> 27:21.848
That's what friends
are for, right?

27:31.524 --> 27:33.276
{\an3}Look, Sanders,
I got work to do.

27:33.360 --> 27:34.903
{\an3}I don't have time for all
this Hollywood jabber.

27:34.986 --> 27:37.113
{\an1}Look, I appreciate
your time constraints,

27:37.197 --> 27:38.782
{\an1}so I'll cut right
to the chase.

27:38.865 --> 27:40.867
{\an1}If you let David play
at tonight's dance,

27:40.950 --> 27:43.286
{\an1}I promise I'll stay out
of your face forever.

27:43.370 --> 27:44.788
{\an3}I told you, I already hired
a band for tonight.

27:44.871 --> 27:47.540
So, fire them.
I can't do that.

27:47.624 --> 27:48.917
{\an3}They've got a
signed contract.

27:49.000 --> 27:51.044
Henry, in this business,

27:51.127 --> 27:54.089
{\an1}contracts are meant
to be broken.

27:54.172 --> 27:58.676
{\an3}I guess that's why I never
went into <i> this business,</i> babe.

28:00.970 --> 28:04.265
Is that better?
Is the sun still in your eyes?

28:04.349 --> 28:05.725
No, that's fine.

28:05.809 --> 28:07.644
Oh, yeah, for you, but
now I'm in deep shade.

28:07.727 --> 28:09.646
{\an3}Silver, let me show you
how this thing works, man.

28:09.729 --> 28:11.773
Like this. Like that.

28:11.856 --> 28:14.067
{\an3}Like this.

28:14.150 --> 28:14.859
Mmm.

28:41.553 --> 28:41.845
(laughs)

28:47.183 --> 28:49.102
{\an3}So, the key to our
relationship will be

28:49.185 --> 28:51.771
that we never speak
to each other again?

28:51.855 --> 28:53.940
{\an1}No. We just have to choose
our subjects more carefully.

28:54.023 --> 28:56.818
Okay.

28:56.901 --> 28:59.362
{\an3}We'll stick to,
um, sand castles.

28:59.446 --> 29:01.364
And sports.

29:01.448 --> 29:02.824
And Minnesota.

29:02.907 --> 29:04.367
And weather.

29:04.451 --> 29:05.618
And sex.

29:05.702 --> 29:07.704
Ooh.

29:08.788 --> 29:10.748
I like that one.

29:15.920 --> 29:16.963
{\an1}Listen, Brooke,
I really am sorry.

29:17.046 --> 29:19.007
It's okay.

29:19.090 --> 29:20.341
No, it's not.

29:20.425 --> 29:21.718
{\an1}Everyone's entitled
to their own opinion.

29:21.801 --> 29:23.678
{\an1}After all, it is
a free country, right?

29:23.761 --> 29:25.805
Whatever you say.

29:25.889 --> 29:27.891
I am <i> never</i> going to talk
politics with you again.

29:27.974 --> 29:30.727
{\an3}You take it
too seriously.

29:30.810 --> 29:32.562
{\an1}Yeah, well,
blame it on my mother.

29:32.645 --> 29:34.689
{\an1}She's the real politico
in the family.

29:34.772 --> 29:36.357
{\an3}Well, then let's remember
never to put her

29:36.441 --> 29:37.358
in the same room
with my father.

29:37.442 --> 29:39.694
{\an5}Don't think
they'd get along, huh?
Mm...

29:39.777 --> 29:41.154
Let's put it this way.

29:41.237 --> 29:43.698
If you disagree with him
on <i> any</i> issue whatsoever,

29:43.781 --> 29:45.575
{\an3}you're part
of some sort of

29:45.658 --> 29:47.702
{\an3}worldwide international
conspiracy.

29:47.785 --> 29:49.871
Well, that explains it then.

29:49.954 --> 29:52.040
Hey!

29:52.123 --> 29:54.667
{\an1}Brandon?

29:54.751 --> 29:56.503
Nice timing, Andrea.

29:56.586 --> 29:58.755
{\an1}Sorry.

29:58.838 --> 30:01.549
Sorry. I can't
find Cameron.

30:01.633 --> 30:03.218
{\an1}Well, did you check
the men's room?

30:03.301 --> 30:04.802
{\an1}That's where
he disappeared to last time.

30:04.886 --> 30:06.721
I did. He wasn't there.

30:06.804 --> 30:08.556
And he wasn't in his favorite
hiding place, either.

30:08.640 --> 30:10.683
{\an1}Andrea, relax.
I'm sure he'll show up.

30:10.767 --> 30:11.768
Brandon!

30:11.851 --> 30:13.895
{\an1}Fine. I'll help you
look for him.

30:13.978 --> 30:15.939
Let's go.
Come on.

30:16.022 --> 30:18.525
I'll be right back.

30:21.319 --> 30:22.904
Andrea.

30:22.987 --> 30:26.032
Mrs. Shaw, I have to, um,
talk to you about Cameron.

30:26.115 --> 30:28.660
Sure.

30:28.743 --> 30:29.911
(sighs)

30:29.994 --> 30:31.246
I'll be leaving now.

30:31.329 --> 30:32.622
Thanks, Brandon.

30:32.705 --> 30:35.083
I... I thought I'd lost him.

30:35.166 --> 30:36.834
I looked everywhere.

30:38.086 --> 30:40.713
Could I talk to him alone
just for a second?

30:40.797 --> 30:42.507
{\an3}Of course you can.
Come on in.

30:42.590 --> 30:44.676
Thanks.

30:44.759 --> 30:46.761
(seagulls cawing)

30:50.807 --> 30:52.809
{\an1}Cameron,
put that down.

30:56.854 --> 30:58.773
Why'd you run away?

31:00.191 --> 31:01.943
You don't know?

31:03.736 --> 31:05.905
Are you mad at me?

31:07.699 --> 31:10.743
I ran away because
I didn't want to say good-bye.

31:10.827 --> 31:11.953
I know.

31:12.036 --> 31:14.289
Saying good-bye--

31:14.372 --> 31:16.583
{\an1}it's hard
for me, too, but

31:16.666 --> 31:20.003
Cameron, you shouldn't
have run away.

31:21.671 --> 31:23.172
What's wrong?

31:27.218 --> 31:29.762
I love you.

31:29.846 --> 31:31.973
I love you, too.

31:32.056 --> 31:34.809
{\an1}I want you
to know something.

31:34.892 --> 31:36.185
You were very brave

31:36.269 --> 31:40.815
to tell a girl
how you feel about her.

31:40.898 --> 31:43.818
I know boys twice your age

31:43.901 --> 31:46.112
who can't do that.

31:46.195 --> 31:49.699
You and I are
very special

31:49.782 --> 31:51.701
friends,

31:51.784 --> 31:55.288
and special friends--

31:55.371 --> 31:58.625
they can last a lifetime.

32:00.251 --> 32:02.587
Okay?

32:05.089 --> 32:07.216
{\an1}Ah, you're such
a good boy.

32:08.259 --> 32:11.638
Okay, well,

32:11.721 --> 32:14.432
{\an1}let's go before
the judging starts, okay?

32:14.515 --> 32:16.517
{\an1}Come on.

32:17.769 --> 32:19.270
(overlapping crowd chatter)

32:54.972 --> 32:56.683
Ooh, Kelly!

32:56.766 --> 32:57.934
{\an1}Kelly, hi.

32:58.017 --> 32:59.519
So, uh, where's
your creation?

32:59.602 --> 33:00.561
{\an1}Oh, it's, uh,
over there.

33:00.645 --> 33:03.481
{\an1}Dylan's trying to put
the finishing touches on it.

33:03.564 --> 33:06.275
Can I talk to you
about something?

33:06.359 --> 33:08.236
Sure.

33:08.319 --> 33:10.863
It's about Dylan.

33:10.947 --> 33:12.198
What?

33:12.281 --> 33:15.201
{\an1}Did you see him much
during summer?

33:15.284 --> 33:16.911
I don't know.

33:16.994 --> 33:19.080
{\an3}He was...
He was around.

33:19.163 --> 33:23.042
{\an1}Look, I... I know this
is going to sound crazy,

33:23.126 --> 33:24.210
but I get the feeling

33:24.293 --> 33:25.753
{\an1}that he was seeing someone
while I was gone.

33:25.837 --> 33:27.588
{\an3}Why would
you say that?

33:27.672 --> 33:29.298
He's being too nice to me.

33:29.382 --> 33:30.258
{\an5}(laughs)
Brenda.
Look, I know

33:30.341 --> 33:32.468
it sounds
as if I'm being paranoid,

33:32.552 --> 33:34.721
but it's like he's trying
to make up for something,

33:34.804 --> 33:36.931
and I'm afraid he'll think
that I don't trust him

33:37.014 --> 33:38.266
if I bug him about it.

33:39.684 --> 33:41.144
But what if he was
seeing someone else?

33:41.227 --> 33:43.980
Brenda, Dylan adores you.

33:44.063 --> 33:46.482
I know...
and he's really sweet.

33:46.566 --> 33:49.277
It's just that I'm getting
this funny vibe from him.

33:49.360 --> 33:51.904
It's probably because
you were just gone for so long.

33:51.988 --> 33:52.572
That's it.

33:52.655 --> 33:56.492
I hate that I am so jealous.

33:56.576 --> 33:58.286
I'm overreacting. You're right.

33:59.537 --> 34:01.456
Look, don't say anything
to Dylan, okay?

34:01.539 --> 34:02.623
Not even kidding?

34:02.707 --> 34:04.125
Your secret's safe with me.

34:04.208 --> 34:07.211
Thanks. Bye.

34:07.295 --> 34:08.795
(seagulls screeching)

34:08.880 --> 34:09.255
(sighs)

34:10.255 --> 34:13.050
{\an3}I know you.

34:13.134 --> 34:14.302
{\an3}You're...

34:14.385 --> 34:15.511
Ron Checkic.

34:15.594 --> 34:16.262
Ron Checkic.
Ron Checkic!

34:16.344 --> 34:18.764
{\an3}Good to see you.
Steve Sanders.

34:18.848 --> 34:19.639
{\an3}Sanders
Management Group?

34:19.724 --> 34:20.975
Uh, could you help me

34:21.058 --> 34:22.143
{\an1}with the other end
of this, uh, speaker here?

34:22.226 --> 34:24.145
{\an3}Yeah, sure.

34:24.228 --> 34:25.563
{\an3}Look, I was
hoping you

34:25.646 --> 34:27.440
{\an3}and your guys could
help me out here.

34:27.523 --> 34:28.649
I'm breaking
a new singer.

34:28.733 --> 34:30.943
{\an1}He's on the verge
of a major record deal,

34:31.027 --> 34:32.695
and, well, he needs
some more exposure.

34:32.779 --> 34:33.696
You know what I'm saying?

34:33.780 --> 34:35.239
No. No, I don't know
what you're saying.

34:35.322 --> 34:37.658
Okay, okay.
How about this?

34:37.742 --> 34:40.661
{\an6}What would it
take for you to walk
away from this gig?

34:40.745 --> 34:41.661
What is this?

34:41.746 --> 34:43.998
Let's call it a negotiation.

34:44.081 --> 34:45.291
Forget it.

34:45.373 --> 34:47.251
You don't have that kind
of money.

34:47.335 --> 34:48.878
Try me.

34:51.297 --> 34:54.175
(cheering and applause)

34:54.257 --> 34:57.345
{\an1}Ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls,

34:57.428 --> 35:00.348
{\an1}the award in the professional
category goes

35:00.431 --> 35:03.142
to the Texas Capital Building

35:03.226 --> 35:05.728
{\an1}by the Jans Design
and Development Company.

35:05.812 --> 35:09.190
(cheering and applause)

35:10.566 --> 35:14.070
{\an1}Great, guys.
Congratulations.

35:14.153 --> 35:16.322
{\an1}Last but not least
is the award

35:16.405 --> 35:18.032
in the amateur category,

35:18.115 --> 35:19.283
and this, ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls,

35:19.367 --> 35:21.285
was not an easy choice.

35:21.369 --> 35:25.748
And the blue ribbon goes to...
Andrea Zuckerman

35:25.832 --> 35:28.751
{\an1}and the kids from the Beverly
Hills Beach Club Day Camp

35:28.835 --> 35:31.254
{\an1}for their sculpture
of the Batmobile.

35:31.337 --> 35:34.173
(cheering and applause)

35:34.257 --> 35:35.424
{\an3}Well, we got beat
by the Romper Room.

35:35.508 --> 35:38.553
Fix was in.

35:38.636 --> 35:42.223
{\an3}Well, you got to admit
Andrea did work pretty hard

35:42.306 --> 35:43.391
with those kids.

35:43.474 --> 35:44.433
They deserve it.

35:44.517 --> 35:46.561
Yeah, I guess.

35:46.644 --> 35:48.729
{\an3}I just don't get why
she works here anyway.

35:48.813 --> 35:50.523
It's not like she
needs the money.

35:50.606 --> 35:51.732
Oh, of course not.

35:51.816 --> 35:53.234
Nobody needs money.

35:53.317 --> 35:55.903
{\an3}Come on.
Andrea <i> Zuckerman?</i>

35:55.987 --> 35:59.240
Hold it.

35:59.323 --> 36:00.533
What are you saying?

36:00.616 --> 36:03.077
She's a Jewish girl
from Beverly Hills.

36:03.161 --> 36:05.454
What?!

36:05.538 --> 36:07.582
{\an3}Hold on!
Hold on, Brandon.

36:07.665 --> 36:09.208
{\an3}I meant that
as a compliment.

36:09.292 --> 36:11.711
I think you should just
stop talking now, okay?

36:11.794 --> 36:14.255
{\an3}No, no, I'm not going
to let you tell me

36:14.338 --> 36:15.756
I'm wrong about
this one, too.

36:15.840 --> 36:17.758
Jewish people are
great with money.

36:17.842 --> 36:19.552
I meant it as
a compliment.

36:19.635 --> 36:21.721
{\an1}Wait. Brooke,
that is not a compliment.

36:21.804 --> 36:23.389
That's a stereotype.

36:23.472 --> 36:27.101
{\an1}You know, not all
black people have rhythm,

36:27.184 --> 36:28.436
{\an1}not all Latin people
are hot-tempered,

36:28.519 --> 36:31.731
{\an1}and not all Jewish people
are great with money.

36:31.814 --> 36:32.648
For God's sakes,

36:32.732 --> 36:34.942
Andrea lives in a tiny
one-bedroom apartment

36:35.026 --> 36:35.985
with her grandmother.

36:36.068 --> 36:38.613
{\an3}I really don't care
where she lives, Brandon.

36:40.531 --> 36:42.700
(sighs)

36:42.783 --> 36:45.244
This is great, great.

36:45.328 --> 36:48.581
We went a whole what, hour,
before getting into a fight?

36:48.664 --> 36:50.458
Must be a world
record for us.

36:50.541 --> 36:52.793
You know, Brooke, I don't think
it's such a good idea

36:52.877 --> 36:54.128
that we see each other anymore.

36:54.211 --> 36:55.963
What?

36:56.047 --> 36:58.049
We're gonna break up over this?

36:59.967 --> 37:02.303
Brandon, come on.

37:02.386 --> 37:04.472
I'm crazy about you.

37:05.389 --> 37:08.309
I can change.

37:08.392 --> 37:10.770
Yeah, well, I can't.

37:30.957 --> 37:33.876
You told me these guys were
professional musicians.

37:33.960 --> 37:36.003
No, you told me they should be
arriving any minute.

37:36.087 --> 37:38.089
That was two hours ago!

37:39.090 --> 37:42.009
No, no, no, that's no good.

37:42.093 --> 37:43.678
Look, look, I want a combo.

37:43.761 --> 37:45.304
I don't want some guy
from Pennsylvania

37:45.388 --> 37:46.847
playing some accordion.

37:46.931 --> 37:49.976
{\an1}Well, just get some people
over here now, okay?

37:51.268 --> 37:54.647
Can you believe
these guys stiffed me?

37:54.730 --> 37:56.649
What can I say, Henry?

37:56.732 --> 37:58.985
There're a lot of flakes
in this business.

38:03.781 --> 38:05.700
Can your guy really sing?

38:05.783 --> 38:07.451
DAVID:
♪ I love to touch ♪

38:07.535 --> 38:09.203

{\an3}Wow, he has

38:37.690 --> 38:39.567
{\an1}I had no idea.
Yeah, well,

38:39.650 --> 38:41.902
I'm bringing him along slowly,

38:41.986 --> 38:43.904
you know, teaching him
how to phrase a lyric,

38:43.988 --> 38:45.906
sell an audience...

38:45.990 --> 38:47.742
all the things
a top-notch manager does.

38:47.825 --> 38:49.035
What?

38:49.118 --> 38:50.453
Like shut up, and let
everyone else listen

38:50.536 --> 38:51.954
to his song.
Yeah, shut up.

38:53.998 --> 38:57.793

39:21.692 --> 39:23.611
When I was in Paris,

39:23.694 --> 39:25.863
I'd wake up early,

39:25.946 --> 39:27.823
to take a walk
down the Seine

39:27.907 --> 39:29.950
{\an3}just to see the
moon get lost

39:30.034 --> 39:31.535
in the morning light.

39:33.996 --> 39:35.956
{\an3}And I'd be thinking
about you,

39:36.040 --> 39:38.751
{\an3}halfway around
the world,

39:38.834 --> 39:42.463
wondering if you were somewhere
on the beach looking up

39:42.546 --> 39:42.755
at the same moon.

39:43.756 --> 39:46.801
I was.

39:46.884 --> 39:51.305
And then I'd wonder if there was
anyone else in your arms.

39:53.557 --> 39:58.604
After a while I just stopped
worrying about it.

40:00.064 --> 40:02.691
I figured if there
was anyone else,

40:02.775 --> 40:04.360
it was only because I was there,

40:04.443 --> 40:04.819
and you were here,
and vice-versa.

40:04.902 --> 40:06.654
That's right.

40:06.737 --> 40:11.617
Dylan, I met someone in Paris.

40:11.700 --> 40:14.870
{\an3}Rick,
my tour guide.

40:14.954 --> 40:17.373
{\an3}Well, actually, I
was his tour guide.

40:17.456 --> 40:19.166
It's kind of
a long story.

40:19.250 --> 40:21.627
We were only together the last
couple of days I was there,

40:21.710 --> 40:23.754
and it really didn't amount
to anything much.

40:30.761 --> 40:32.680
So...

40:32.763 --> 40:35.558
are you finished
with your summer vacation?

40:35.641 --> 40:38.811
Yes.

40:43.274 --> 40:44.692
What about you?

40:44.775 --> 40:48.195
Are you ready to start
our senior year together,

40:48.279 --> 40:50.614
you and me?

40:52.950 --> 40:54.160
Dylan.

41:01.292 --> 41:03.419
Welcome home, Brenda.

41:10.801 --> 41:12.761
(house music playing)

41:24.648 --> 41:27.234
(music stops, applause)
Woo!

41:27.318 --> 41:28.527
Yeah!

41:28.611 --> 41:29.945
All right!

41:32.448 --> 41:33.741
(cheering and whistling)

41:36.660 --> 41:38.078
Thank you, um...

41:38.162 --> 41:38.746
Let's all take a break now.

41:38.829 --> 41:40.915
We'll be back.

41:40.998 --> 41:42.583
I'm sorry, I'll be back
in, uh, 15 minutes.

41:42.666 --> 41:43.792
Thanks.

41:43.876 --> 41:47.087
{\an1}STEVE:
Brandon,

41:47.171 --> 41:49.089
{\an1}Andrea told me you sent
Brooke packing?

41:49.173 --> 41:50.341
Yup.

41:50.424 --> 41:52.301
She's all yours, buddy.

41:52.384 --> 41:54.261
I can't believe
you dumped her.

41:54.345 --> 41:55.221
What was I gonna do?

41:55.304 --> 41:57.097
{\an3}Drive down to Palos
Verdes every weekend?

41:57.181 --> 41:58.140
{\an3}It was a summer
fling, man.

41:58.224 --> 41:59.225
{\an3}No big deal.
Yeah.

41:59.308 --> 42:00.643
Well, anyway, I guess it's
better we're available now

42:00.726 --> 42:02.895
{\an1}for all those pretty
young things

42:02.978 --> 42:05.272
that are gonna be starting
Beverly and West Beverly.

42:05.356 --> 42:06.607
You got that.

42:06.690 --> 42:08.609
{\an1}See you, bro.
Later.

42:08.692 --> 42:11.612
{\an1}KELLY:
Hey, Brandon.

42:11.695 --> 42:15.241
{\an1}You look like you're having
as good a night as I am.

42:15.324 --> 42:16.784
(laughs)
What's your excuse?

42:16.867 --> 42:18.118
{\an3}Ah, where should
I start?

42:18.202 --> 42:19.954
{\an3}The trip I didn't take,
the job I had,

42:20.037 --> 42:21.622
or the perfect girl

42:21.705 --> 42:22.998
{\an3}who turned out
to be anything but.

42:23.082 --> 42:24.166
I don't know, Kel.

42:24.250 --> 42:25.084
{\an3}Basically, a whole
summer came and went.

42:25.167 --> 42:26.835
{\an3}I don't have anything
to show for it.

42:26.919 --> 42:30.297
Well, you got a good tan.

42:30.381 --> 42:31.799
Thanks, Kelly.

42:31.882 --> 42:33.842
I feel better already.

42:33.926 --> 42:35.970
You're welcome.

42:42.351 --> 42:43.686
Silver!

42:43.769 --> 42:45.896
I didn't know you were
such a crooner, my brother!

42:45.980 --> 42:47.022
{\an1}Thank you.
(laughing)

42:47.106 --> 42:48.357
David,
you were wonderful.

42:48.440 --> 42:49.900
{\an1}Thanks.
Hey, everybody,

42:49.984 --> 42:51.318
{\an6}here's to Silver's
music career.
Hey, hey.

42:51.402 --> 42:52.319
And here's to Andrea,

42:52.403 --> 42:54.196
for building the best
sand sculpture this side

42:54.280 --> 42:55.656
of the San Andreas Fault
at least.

42:55.739 --> 42:56.699
(glasses clinking)

42:56.782 --> 42:58.158
{\an4}BRENDA:
And I have
a special toast.

42:58.242 --> 43:00.160
{\an3}It took me going halfway
around the world

43:00.244 --> 43:02.121
{\an3}to realize that I have
the best bunch of friends

43:02.204 --> 43:03.372
a girl could ever have.

43:03.455 --> 43:05.499
Aww.

43:05.582 --> 43:07.501
And I love you all.

43:07.585 --> 43:09.420
Especially you.

43:11.213 --> 43:13.299
{\an1}STEVE:
Well, uh...

43:13.382 --> 43:14.675
(laughing)

43:14.758 --> 43:15.884
...here's to us.

43:15.968 --> 43:17.886
And our senior year.

43:17.970 --> 43:20.055
{\an1}Which starts
in exactly six days,

43:20.139 --> 43:22.099
eight hours and...

43:22.182 --> 43:23.809
{\an1}24 minutes.
(sighs)

43:23.892 --> 43:25.144
{\an1}STEVE:
Well,

43:25.227 --> 43:26.895
{\an1}at least we'll rule
the school this year.

43:28.439 --> 43:29.189
{\an1}I can't believe
summer's almost over.

43:29.273 --> 43:31.817
{\an3}Yeah, but we'll
always have Paris.

43:31.900 --> 43:33.235
Right.
(giggling)

43:51.253 --> 43:53.172
Hi.

43:53.255 --> 43:55.174
Dylan, look,

43:55.257 --> 43:57.176
{\an1}you don't have to keep
checking up on me.

43:57.259 --> 43:59.094
{\an3}That's not what
I'm doing.

43:59.178 --> 44:02.222
{\an3}I just want to thank you
again for yesterday.

44:02.306 --> 44:05.267
That was yesterday?

44:05.351 --> 44:06.852
Kelly...

44:06.935 --> 44:09.396
{\an3}you know, you're
a smart lady.

44:09.480 --> 44:12.232
Dylan, I'm happy for you...

44:12.316 --> 44:14.234
and for Brenda.

44:14.318 --> 44:16.236
You guys belong together.

44:16.320 --> 44:19.239
So let's just leave it alone,
okay?

44:19.323 --> 44:21.075
But where does
that leave you, Kel?

44:21.158 --> 44:23.369
We can't have it both ways.

44:23.452 --> 44:25.913
So, you're telling me
just go back to Brenda

44:25.996 --> 44:28.290
and forget everything
that happened?

44:29.333 --> 44:31.377
We'll always have Paris.

44:31.460 --> 44:34.004
It is not funny anymore.

44:37.966 --> 44:41.512
I guess nothing lasts forever.

44:44.681 --> 44:46.683
Kelly...

44:48.477 --> 44:51.480
(waves crashing)
