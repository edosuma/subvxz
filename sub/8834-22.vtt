There it is, Kit...

01:03.959 --> 01:07.750
Be it every so narrow,
there's no place like home.

01:09.208 --> 01:12.041
Huh, took that a little fast,
didn't you, Baloo?

01:12.125 --> 01:15.166
Yeah, but I won't tell if you won't.

01:15.250 --> 01:16.625
[siren blaring]

01:16.709 --> 01:18.875
Uh-oh, tell that to them.

01:29.959 --> 01:32.208
[Baloo]
Hot diggity, a she cop.

01:32.291 --> 01:35.750
Hey, watch old Baloo,
sweet talk his way out of this ticket.

01:36.208 --> 01:38.375
Well, afternoon, officer.

01:38.458 --> 01:41.959
My, your peepers sparkle
like your badge.

01:42.041 --> 01:44.834
Flattery will get
you five-to-ten, hot shot.

01:44.917 --> 01:46.333
Let me see your pilot's license.

01:46.417 --> 01:51.542
Uh... officer, couldn't we overlook
a speeding ticket just this once?

01:51.625 --> 01:55.500
-Nope.
-Well, how about if I take seven orphans

01:55.583 --> 01:58.500
-to the Barnum and Piccadilly Circus?
-Nope.

01:58.583 --> 02:02.500
I'll buy my mother a ticket
to the air police ball?

02:02.583 --> 02:06.333
Hm, deal.
No speeding ticket today.

02:06.417 --> 02:10.625
-Well, then what's this for?
-Driving with an expired license.

02:14.583 --> 02:16.458
-[door opens]
-[Rebecca grunting]

02:16.542 --> 02:19.166
-[door shuts]
-Oh, good you're back, Baloo.

02:19.250 --> 02:21.250
I need you to deliver
this crate of red herrings

02:21.333 --> 02:23.333
to the Sherlock Retirement Homes.

02:23.417 --> 02:26.959
Uh, there's a teeny-weeny
problem, Beckers.

02:27.041 --> 02:30.875
-What?
-I, um... I can't fly.

02:30.959 --> 02:34.458
-My pilot's license expired.
-How could you?

02:34.542 --> 02:39.959
Of all the idiotic, stupid,
imbecilic, moronic things to do!

02:40.041 --> 02:44.542
Calm down.
I'll renew my license, no problem.

02:44.625 --> 02:48.250
You'd better, or I'm out a pilot
and you're out a job.

02:48.792 --> 02:51.875
Come on, little britches.
Let's head over to F.L.A.P.

02:51.959 --> 02:53.500
-Flap?
-Yeah.

02:53.583 --> 02:56.500
The Federal Licensing Agency for Pilots.

02:57.667 --> 03:00.125
Well, filled up your gas tank,
Miss Cunningham.

03:00.125 --> 03:02.041
That'll be $120.

03:02.125 --> 03:04.542
What? Why so much?

03:04.625 --> 03:07.041
Gas prices have doubled.
Haven't you heard?

03:07.125 --> 03:10.625
How am I supposed to stay in business
with these prices?

03:10.709 --> 03:14.834
-Who's responsible for this?
-The big boss, Mr. Khan.

03:18.458 --> 03:20.458
Hey, where are you going?

03:20.542 --> 03:23.875
Tell Mr. Khan, he no Khan do!

03:26.625 --> 03:31.792
[man] Stop, stop! You can't come in here!
Mr. Khan sees no one!

03:31.875 --> 03:36.583
He'll see me!
No yes-man is gonna tell me no!

03:36.667 --> 03:41.500
It's all right.
Let Miss Cunningham speak her piece.

03:42.208 --> 03:44.458
First of all...
[pants]

03:44.542 --> 03:49.917
May I have a glass of water?
It's a long walk across your office.

03:50.041 --> 03:51.750
[pants]

03:55.333 --> 03:59.667
I bet you're here
about the high gas prices.

03:59.750 --> 04:01.041
Why, yes.

04:01.125 --> 04:03.250
Mr. Khan!

04:04.458 --> 04:08.250
Another oil tanker's been hijacked
and disappeared, sir.

04:08.333 --> 04:14.583
-Oh! Pirates again?
-Afraid so, sir.

04:14.667 --> 04:17.709
Oh, that Don Karnage.

04:17.791 --> 04:20.166
He's making it impossible for the public.

04:20.250 --> 04:23.291
Prices will have to go higher.

04:23.375 --> 04:27.166
Yes, but high prices
make it difficult for my business.

04:27.250 --> 04:29.583
How am I supposed to
come up with extra money?

04:29.667 --> 04:35.208
Oh, I don't know. It's always
the little guy who suffers most.

04:35.291 --> 04:38.125
I suppose I could check my sofa
for loose change.

04:38.208 --> 04:41.709
Sorry if I bothered you, Mr. Khan.

04:41.792 --> 04:45.792
No, no.
I'm sorry, dear.

04:49.166 --> 04:52.000
Deliver a telegram to Don Karnage

04:52.083 --> 04:57.083
congratulating him
on the successful hijacks.

04:57.417 --> 05:00.542
[Baloo] Hold on to your
goggles and scarf, little britches.

05:00.625 --> 05:04.959
I'm gonna get my license renewed so fast,
they'll give me a speeding ticket.

05:05.917 --> 05:09.291
Your examining officer
will be Mr. Throgmorton.

05:10.500 --> 05:12.583
[Baloo]
Hold the anchovies!

05:12.667 --> 05:16.041
Not Ralph "Love-to-flunk-'em" Throgmorton!

05:16.125 --> 05:17.625
You know that guy?

05:17.709 --> 05:21.917
I know he's trouble. Old Throggy
was my driver's ed teacher.

05:26.667 --> 05:30.000
Today, Baloo,
we're studying the ABCs of driving.

05:30.083 --> 05:33.834
Great! What do you say
we get the XYZ out of here?

05:39.875 --> 05:43.500
-What do you think you're doing?
-Uh, driving?

05:43.583 --> 05:46.625
This isn't driving.
This is unorganized chaos.

05:46.750 --> 05:50.291
Start again.
This time, proceed alphabetically.

05:50.375 --> 05:51.417
Oh, yeah, right.

05:51.500 --> 05:54.792
-A: accelerate the accelerator.
-Check.

05:54.875 --> 05:56.792
-[beeping]
-Uh... B...

05:56.875 --> 06:00.959
In my book, honk the horn,
comes under H, not B.

06:01.917 --> 06:05.542
I was hoping blast the beep-beep
comes under B.

06:05.625 --> 06:07.083
Minus five points.

06:07.166 --> 06:10.458
-Now, put the car in reverse.
-Uh, you want me to back up?

06:10.542 --> 06:15.333
-Yes. Now, go ahead.
-What? Go ahead or back up?

06:15.417 --> 06:20.667
-Go ahead and back up.
-Uh, eeny, meeny, miney, moe.

06:23.208 --> 06:26.875
-I said back up!
-You said go ahead!

06:26.959 --> 06:30.208
I say... that's another five points.

06:31.375 --> 06:34.500
[Baloo] <i>I'm telling you, little britches,</i>
<i>he got me so nervous,</i>

06:34.583 --> 06:36.792
<i>I didn't know my right from my left.</i>

06:36.875 --> 06:39.792
-Turn right on the next street.
-OK.

06:39.875 --> 06:41.542
I pledge allegiance to the flag...

06:41.625 --> 06:45.041
-What are you doing?
-Well, this is how I tell left from right.

06:45.125 --> 06:48.583
-Right goes over your heart.
-But you missed the street!

06:48.667 --> 06:49.500
[tires screeching]

06:54.125 --> 06:58.125
You are the most idiotic,
stupid, imbecilic--

06:58.208 --> 07:01.375
-You left out moronic.
-Moronic driver in the world!

07:01.417 --> 07:06.041
Yeah, but, look on the bright side, teach,
you got a free car wash.

07:06.959 --> 07:09.750
Oh, ah...
[yelling]

07:12.458 --> 07:15.375
OK, but that was then, and this is now.

07:15.458 --> 07:17.959
You're the best pilot in Cape Suzette.

07:18.083 --> 07:20.250
-Nah...
-In the country!

07:20.333 --> 07:23.375
-No way.
-In the world!

07:23.458 --> 07:25.000
Uh, you left out universe.

07:25.083 --> 07:28.375
Right.
So what are you worried about?

07:28.458 --> 07:32.125
You know, kiddo,
when you're right, you're right!

07:32.208 --> 07:35.208
You must be Baloo.
Ready for your test?

07:35.291 --> 07:39.375
Yep, let's get this show on the road.
Uh, in the air that is.

07:40.083 --> 07:43.583
Baloo... hmm, something familiar
about that name.

07:43.667 --> 07:47.417
Common, very common.
You know, Smith, Jones, Baloo.

07:47.500 --> 07:49.667
Begin with the preflight checkoff list.

07:49.750 --> 07:52.083
ABCs again, huh?
Well, let me see.

07:52.166 --> 07:54.917
-A: uh... check aileron.
-Check.

07:55.000 --> 07:57.458
B... B... what starts with B?

07:58.291 --> 08:03.875
-Your propellers start with P, not B!
-[chuckles] Yeah, yeah, but they buzz.

08:04.166 --> 08:07.291
You've just lost five points, mister.

08:07.375 --> 08:12.583
Um, A, B, C, D...
X, Y, G...

08:13.041 --> 08:14.000
Uh...

08:15.166 --> 08:18.250
[Throgmorton]
Baloo! Now I remember!

08:18.333 --> 08:21.667
[Rebecca] Oh, dear, oh dear,
what if Baloo doesn't pass?

08:21.750 --> 08:24.750
What will I do?
Where will I find another pilot?

08:24.834 --> 08:26.250
Howdy, hi, hi!

08:26.333 --> 08:27.625
Well? Well?

08:27.709 --> 08:30.375
Do you want the good news or the bad news?

08:30.458 --> 08:32.291
Let's get the bad news over with.

08:32.375 --> 08:34.792
Fine.
Gas prices went higher.

08:34.875 --> 08:37.166
I know that.
What's the good news?

08:37.250 --> 08:40.958
You won't need any gas.
'Cause I can't fly.

08:41.041 --> 08:44.375
-No license.
-Oh, no!

08:44.458 --> 08:48.041
This is one bear
without the bare necessities.

08:48.125 --> 08:51.667
I can't believe this.
First, the price of gas goes sky-high.

08:51.750 --> 08:54.625
Now, my one and only pilot is grounded.

08:54.709 --> 08:58.792
March right back to F.L.A.P.
and take that pilot's test over again.

08:58.875 --> 09:03.875
Oh, what's the point? I'll never pass.
I'll never fly again.

09:03.959 --> 09:07.667
But you have to, I need you.
Where are you going?

09:07.750 --> 09:12.083
-To get my bussing license.
-Why do you want to drive a bus?

09:12.166 --> 09:17.208
I don't, gonna bus tables, or something.
I got to make a living somehow.

09:20.542 --> 09:22.417
[horns honking]

09:32.709 --> 09:35.125
Trying another profession, I see.

09:35.208 --> 09:36.750
Hey, hey, it's a gas.

09:36.834 --> 09:41.500
I make 15 cents an hour
and all the axle grease I can eat.

09:41.583 --> 09:44.709
Besides, I flunked the bussing test.

09:45.291 --> 09:47.166
Crashed a dessert trolley.

09:48.250 --> 09:50.667
-Fill 'er up.
-Right away, here I go.

09:50.750 --> 09:52.750
Swing your partner do-si-do.

09:53.458 --> 09:56.041
The proper way to
check out a vehicle is to do it--

09:56.125 --> 09:58.750
Oh, let me guess, alphabetically?

09:58.834 --> 10:02.000
First, A: for air in the tires.
B: for brake fluid,

10:02.083 --> 10:06.458
then coolant, dipstick, electrical,
fan belt, and then gas.

10:10.500 --> 10:12.125
Not in the radiator!

10:12.208 --> 10:16.375
Well... don't blame me.
It's you and your ABCs!

10:16.458 --> 10:19.834
Oh, yeah? Then why are you
pumping water into my tire!

10:20.208 --> 10:22.750
You dipstick!
Look what you've done!

10:22.834 --> 10:25.250
I want this man fired!

10:32.667 --> 10:37.667
At least this is one job
where I won't bump into a Throgmorton.

10:37.750 --> 10:40.500
OK, kiddies, buckle your belts!

10:40.583 --> 10:43.625
No! Buckle belts starts with B.

10:43.709 --> 10:47.500
First comes
A: airplane altitude announcement.

10:47.583 --> 10:51.834
Say, you're not related to...
Nah, can't be.

10:52.583 --> 10:55.125
No, no, no.
Not the control stick!

10:55.208 --> 11:00.667
You have to do B for belts first!
I'm not wearing my seat belt!

11:03.625 --> 11:08.875
B isn't for backwards, it's for brake!
Help!

11:12.625 --> 11:15.458
Hold on, kidderoos!
I'll stop you!

11:18.458 --> 11:21.166
[grunting]

11:21.250 --> 11:24.333
I want this man fired!

11:25.250 --> 11:30.417
[Baloo] Second floor, ladies' lingerie.
Third floor, cribs and bibs.

11:36.291 --> 11:40.750
[gasps] It's him, Grandpa, the man
who scared me on the airplane ride!

11:40.834 --> 11:43.917
-I should've known.
-No, I should've known.

11:44.000 --> 11:45.875
No, no, no, no!

11:45.959 --> 11:48.166
I don't want to ride!
I'm scared!

11:48.500 --> 11:52.583
Cathy dear, calm down.
Elevators are very simple to run.

11:52.667 --> 11:54.667
First you, A: announce floor,

11:54.750 --> 11:57.834
B... What have you done?
Of all the stupid, imbecilic--

11:57.917 --> 12:01.208
-[Baloo] You left out moronic.
-[Throgmorton] Moronic things to do!

12:01.583 --> 12:03.917
[both] We want this man fired!

12:19.208 --> 12:21.583
[Louie scatting]

12:21.667 --> 12:26.333
Hey, cuz! Why the long face?
You lose something?

12:26.417 --> 12:28.834
Yeah, my confidence.

12:28.917 --> 12:32.625
[laughs]
Then you've come to the right place.

12:32.709 --> 12:36.083
I hope so.
I got a note to meet Becky here.

12:36.166 --> 12:37.458
Any sign of her?

12:37.542 --> 12:39.291
[all] Surprise!

12:39.625 --> 12:42.083
Why, is it my birthday already?

12:42.166 --> 12:45.250
No, it's a pepper-upper party!

12:45.333 --> 12:49.792
Yeah, we're here to remind you
what made you a great pilot...

12:50.125 --> 12:52.500
like the time you lost the air pirates

12:52.583 --> 12:55.375
in that dogfight
over lhaso-apso, remember?

12:55.458 --> 12:59.792
<i>You were hauling the Doggi Lama's</i>
<i>secret spicy chicken recipe.</i>

12:59.875 --> 13:03.125
<i>But the air pirates found out</i>
<i>and couldn't keep their sticky fingers</i>

13:03.208 --> 13:05.125
<i>of the finger-licking goods.</i>

13:05.208 --> 13:08.583
What are we gonna do, Papa Bear,
give up the recipe?

13:08.667 --> 13:13.125
And let the bad guys
get the secret herbs and spices? Never.

13:13.208 --> 13:15.458
Hold on, little britches.

13:16.667 --> 13:21.000
[Kit] <i>Lucky for us, you knew a secret</i>
<i>hiding place in the mountain range.</i>

13:21.208 --> 13:25.125
[Baloo] <i>Yeah, I lost the lasses</i>
<i>with a loop-the-loop.</i>

13:25.208 --> 13:26.166
[Baloo yelling]

13:26.250 --> 13:30.959
[Kit] <i>It was the first time anybody</i>
<i>ever made a three-point landing</i>

13:31.041 --> 13:32.625
<i>inside a volcano.</i>

13:32.709 --> 13:37.041
Yeah. It's still known
as the Krakatoa Touchdown.

13:37.125 --> 13:43.166
Hey, man. What about the time you did
that crazy takeoff from Itsy-bitsia?

13:43.250 --> 13:44.291
Remember?

13:44.375 --> 13:47.458
<i>We went to get a load</i>
<i>of cocktail umbrellas for my club.</i>

13:47.917 --> 13:49.208
[Baloo] <i>Oh, yeah.</i>

13:49.291 --> 13:53.458
<i>But the natives were up in arms</i>
<i>'cause the rainy season was coming.</i>

13:53.792 --> 13:55.458
[all yelling]

13:55.542 --> 13:58.291
They've got maraschino cherry bombs!

13:59.166 --> 14:02.750
Whoa! It's time for us to get gone!
Solid gone!

14:02.834 --> 14:05.917
Right, but there's only one way to go!

14:06.000 --> 14:07.875
Reverse-ho!

14:16.667 --> 14:19.917
See, Baloo?
You are the world's best pilot.

14:20.000 --> 14:24.333
Yeah, and don't forget
your famous pelican dive.

14:24.417 --> 14:27.166
Wildcat, that's nothing to be proud of.

14:27.250 --> 14:29.667
Well, sure it is.
Don't you remember?

14:29.750 --> 14:33.834
<i>Baloo was speeding toward the ocean,</i>
<i>and he crashed in the ocean,</i>

14:33.917 --> 14:38.500
and he had to dredge the ocean
to get the plane out.

14:38.583 --> 14:42.208
Gee, Baloo, that was a really
stupid stunt, wasn't it?

14:42.291 --> 14:44.542
Way to go, Wildcat.

14:44.625 --> 14:48.041
Hey, it wasn't my fault.
The engine stalled.

14:48.125 --> 14:50.542
Hey, we all have our off-days, Baloo.

14:50.625 --> 14:53.291
But you'll get it right someday.

14:53.375 --> 14:57.250
Now are you gonna let some
stuffy, little examiner scare you?

14:57.333 --> 14:59.542
Keep the coach out of the cockpit?

14:59.625 --> 15:03.834
-Stop the sky king?
-Posi-tutely not!

15:03.917 --> 15:07.166
I'll show that alphabetizing buffoon!

15:07.250 --> 15:11.083
Attaboy, Baloo.
You can pass that test.

15:12.041 --> 15:14.542
Uh, could somebody give me a lift?

15:15.458 --> 15:19.166
Don't worry, Throggy,
this time I'm gonna get it right.

15:19.250 --> 15:22.375
I even worked on my ABCs. Watch.

15:22.417 --> 15:25.959
Altimeter, check.
Brakes, double check.

15:26.041 --> 15:28.875
And C for, let's climb!

15:28.959 --> 15:33.083
Hey, did you hear about the time
I landed in a volcano?

15:33.166 --> 15:35.500
Or the time I took off backwards?

15:35.583 --> 15:39.458
Can't say I did. I do remember reading
about your famous pelican dive, though.

15:39.542 --> 15:41.417
Waterlogged your plane for a week.

15:42.000 --> 15:43.083
[engine backfires]

15:43.166 --> 15:45.500
-[Throgmorton] What's that?
-My confidence?

15:45.583 --> 15:47.333
No, you're out of gas.

15:47.417 --> 15:50.000
Why didn't you check the fuel gauge
when you got to F?

15:50.083 --> 15:53.834
Because I checked the flap at F,
which is fine.

15:53.917 --> 15:57.667
That will be a comforting thought
when we crash and burn!

15:57.750 --> 16:00.417
You absent-minded,
bubble-headed, crazy--

16:00.500 --> 16:03.083
Can we cut to moronic and get on with it?

16:03.166 --> 16:07.834
Hold tight. I'll squeeze
the last bit of gas out of this tank.

16:09.000 --> 16:11.917
Oh, shoot, that would've been
a perfect pelican dive

16:12.041 --> 16:14.000
if I wasn't out of gas.

16:15.041 --> 16:17.041
[Throgmorton] What a desolate place.

16:17.125 --> 16:20.458
Nothing here but trees, sand,
and gasoline barrels.

16:20.542 --> 16:24.959
Gasoline barrels?
Talk about your bare necessities.

16:25.041 --> 16:29.750
-Oh, just like my tummy, empty.
-This one, too.

16:33.625 --> 16:37.208
Let's make like Hansel and Gretel,
maybe we'll find one that full.

16:43.208 --> 16:44.917
What are you doing?

16:45.166 --> 16:47.834
Shh... Air pirates.

16:56.125 --> 16:58.041
[gasps]
Air pirates?

17:07.000 --> 17:08.959
What are you doing here?

17:09.040 --> 17:12.875
I have a...
I have a telegram from Shere Khan.

17:12.959 --> 17:16.541
A telegram?
For my wonderful self?

17:16.625 --> 17:21.290
Oh... I'm sorry.
This is a regular green-wrap telegram.

17:21.375 --> 17:26.416
But I am Don Karnage,
roll the R, pirate extraordinaire!

17:26.500 --> 17:29.291
I deserve the best!
I want a singing telegram.

17:29.375 --> 17:34.083
[stuttering]
But I don't sing. It doesn't rhyme.

17:34.166 --> 17:38.083
I think that you do
and think that it will.

17:38.166 --> 17:40.041
This is our chance, come on.

17:40.125 --> 17:44.041
[tiger]
<i>♪ Congratulation ♪</i>

17:44.125 --> 17:46.959
<i>♪ You deserve an ovation ♪</i>

17:47.041 --> 17:50.125
<i>♪ Your hijacks have been slick ♪</i>

17:50.208 --> 17:51.917
<i>♪ Get it, oil ♪</i>

17:52.000 --> 17:54.500
<i>♪ Don't be thick ♪</i>

17:54.583 --> 17:58.417
Bravo, bravo!
You sing fantastically!

17:58.500 --> 18:00.834
Well, if that don't beat all.

18:00.917 --> 18:03.834
Khan is creating his own gas shortage.

18:03.917 --> 18:06.000
That's not how to roll a barrel.

18:06.083 --> 18:10.291
First you, A: tighten your abdomen.
Then, B: bend your knees.

18:10.375 --> 18:12.166
Oh, brother.

18:13.667 --> 18:18.667
-The barrel!
-Hey! They're stealing our stolen stash!

18:19.875 --> 18:22.000
Get inside, I'll fill the tank!

18:22.083 --> 18:23.667
[all yelling]

18:28.125 --> 18:30.333
Hey, you're in the pilot's seat.

18:30.417 --> 18:33.291
That's right.
I'm the one with the pilot's license.

18:33.375 --> 18:34.959
Sit down. We're leaving.

18:35.041 --> 18:37.375
A: check aileron.
B: back flaps.

18:37.458 --> 18:39.500
Will you just skip to G for go!

18:46.417 --> 18:49.417
[all yelling]

18:49.500 --> 18:51.375
To the planes, men!

18:51.458 --> 18:54.291
There you are, Baloo,
a textbook-perfect takeoff.

18:54.375 --> 18:58.000
Great. Now, how about
a textbook-perfect dogfight?

18:58.083 --> 18:59.750
'Cause here the air pirates!

18:59.834 --> 19:02.792
There's nothing in the flyer jet manual
about dogfighting!

19:08.375 --> 19:11.917
[chuckles] That's 'cause
I wrote the book on that subject, teach.

19:12.834 --> 19:13.750
[yells]

19:17.333 --> 19:21.417
Well, do something, fast!
My plane's turning into swiss cheese!

19:21.500 --> 19:26.041
-Let's see, A: alert authorities.
-[Baloo] Ix-nay on the adio-ray.

19:26.125 --> 19:28.709
B... What's B?
I can't think!

19:28.792 --> 19:30.875
B is for Baloo.

19:30.959 --> 19:35.750
License or no license, I've got to
save the <i>Sea Duck, </i> not to mention us!

19:36.917 --> 19:40.041
-[Throgmorton] What are you doing?
-What's he doing?

19:40.125 --> 19:43.083
Pelican dive, don't fail me now.

19:43.166 --> 19:45.834
We're going too fast!
Less throttle! Less throttle!

19:45.917 --> 19:49.417
[Baloo] Uh-uh, that's the mistake
I made last time.

19:49.500 --> 19:50.875
More throttle!

19:52.375 --> 19:54.875
[Throgmorton]
Of all the stupid, idiotic...

19:59.417 --> 20:02.083
Brilliant maneuvers!

20:02.166 --> 20:06.375
[Baloo laughs] It worked!
And it would've the first time, too.

20:06.458 --> 20:09.917
-First time?
-When the <i>Sea Duck </i> sank,

20:10.000 --> 20:13.166
my engine stalled
'cause I cut the throttle.

20:13.250 --> 20:16.709
Which is just what happened
to our pirate pals.

20:16.792 --> 20:19.959
What you did was,
A: absolutely terrifying,

20:20.041 --> 20:22.458
B: breathtakingly scary,

20:22.542 --> 20:28.875
and C... C... quite simply
the best flying I've ever seen.

20:28.959 --> 20:30.959
Really? You think so?

20:31.083 --> 20:34.917
Let's go back to Cape Suzette
and get your license renewed.

20:35.000 --> 20:36.333
You mean it?

20:36.417 --> 20:40.291
You may not know
your ABCs from your XYZs,

20:40.375 --> 20:43.166
but you're an A-pilot in my book.

20:43.959 --> 20:50.709
Aw, thanks, teach.
Now, about my grade in driver's ed...

20:55.917 --> 20:58.250
Well? Well? What happened?

20:58.333 --> 21:02.417
This happened.
I passed with flying colors!

21:02.583 --> 21:05.625
[all cheering]

21:05.709 --> 21:09.208
I also discovered the reason
for the gas shortage.

21:09.291 --> 21:13.792
The pirates and Shere Khan
had a little deal going.

21:13.875 --> 21:18.917
-What? We've got to do something!
-Already done.

21:19.875 --> 21:22.625
The air police should be
on the case right now.

21:22.709 --> 21:26.291
I do hope old Khan takes it well.

21:29.875 --> 21:34.625
Take another telegram to Mr. Karnage.

21:34.709 --> 21:40.834
-A... a singing telegram, sir?
-No, not this time.

21:41.667 --> 21:45.709
Let us go, men,
before the air police arrive.

21:47.417 --> 21:51.792
A telegram for Mr. Karnage!
Telegram for Mr. Karnage!

21:53.583 --> 21:56.750
Oh, you will sing for me again?

21:56.834 --> 22:00.166
Well, not this time, sir,
but this one is special.

22:02.542 --> 22:05.125
It is ticking!
I love this part!

22:05.208 --> 22:07.625
It's a gift for my magnificent self.

22:07.709 --> 22:09.500
A watch, perhaps?
An alarm clock?
