00:00.900 --> 00:04.010
Dozens of people were killed today
during three Jihadist attacks

00:04.120 --> 00:06.885
in Kuwait, Tunisia, and Lyon, France.

00:07.000 --> 00:10.482
The situation in Iraq remains very volatile.

00:10.600 --> 00:12.568
Yemen was plunged into darkness today

00:12.680 --> 00:16.001
when al-Qaeda operatives
attacked the country's power grid.

00:16.160 --> 00:18.811
A massive effort
by the National Security Agency

00:18.920 --> 00:22.720
to track cellphone calls and monitor
email and Internet traffic

00:22.840 --> 00:24.410
of virtually everyone.

00:24.520 --> 00:29.481
We've seen eight successive presidents
increasingly ruled by executive order.

00:29.600 --> 00:32.762
Will Congress bite this dictatorship
of secret government? Of course they won't.

00:32.880 --> 00:37.249
Your class has an incredible
window of opportunity

00:37.360 --> 00:39.249
to lead in shaping

00:39.360 --> 00:41.089
a new world order...

00:41.200 --> 00:43.521
There also exists
an extraordinary opportunity

00:43.640 --> 00:48.407
to form, for the first time in history,
a truly global society.

00:48.520 --> 00:51.490
These global corporations,
these global banks,

00:51.600 --> 00:56.561
will be able to create boons for profit,
depressions for profit, even wars for profit.

00:56.680 --> 01:00.401
We must guard against the acquisition
of unwarranted influence,

01:00.520 --> 01:02.443
whether sought or unsought,

01:02.560 --> 01:05.245
by the military industrial complex.

01:05.360 --> 01:07.681
Large populations
are difficult to control.

01:07.800 --> 01:10.041
That's why the future
the globalists have planned

01:10.160 --> 01:13.926
will contain us, will constrain us,
will eliminate us.

01:14.040 --> 01:18.648
Ordinary men and women are too
small-minded to govern their own affairs.

01:18.760 --> 01:21.286
Order, progress,
can only come when individuals

01:21.400 --> 01:24.244
surrender their rights
to an all-powerful sovereign.

01:24.360 --> 01:28.046
We have a fog that has descended
on our entire nation,

01:28.160 --> 01:30.640
the smoke screen of national security,

01:30.760 --> 01:33.411
used by government at every level

01:33.520 --> 01:36.410
to keep everything they do secret.

01:36.520 --> 01:42.323
We have before us the opportunity to forge,
for ourselves and for future generations,

01:42.440 --> 01:45.330
a new world order when we are successful.

01:45.440 --> 01:47.488
And we will be.

01:47.600 --> 01:50.206
We have a real chance
at this new world order.

01:50.320 --> 01:52.049
Their strength is in secrecy,

01:52.160 --> 01:55.369
but our strength is to shed light
on what they do in the dark

01:55.480 --> 01:58.006
and to stand united against it!

02:00.000 --> 02:06.074

02:07.640 --> 02:09.085
You have ten minutes.

02:13.760 --> 02:16.127
Thank you, Senator. I appreciate the time.

02:16.760 --> 02:18.489
My name is Charles Grey.

02:18.600 --> 02:20.568
I'm a semi-retired businessman

02:20.680 --> 02:23.763
with interests both domestically
and internationally.

02:23.880 --> 02:27.805
The reason I'm here today
is to encourage the U.S. Congress

02:27.960 --> 02:31.965
to take action to protect our country
from its most imminent threat.

02:37.520 --> 02:41.969
We don't need you
to try to educate us on threats.

02:42.080 --> 02:45.448
Your Congress commissioned a study
that found that our nation

02:45.600 --> 02:50.811
is sustained by a vulnerable
and woefully outdated power grid.

02:50.920 --> 02:54.288
Your commission found that our enemies...
and yes, even we...

02:54.440 --> 02:58.286
have developed weapons that are designed
to bring down this grid.

03:05.360 --> 03:07.886
Your peers determined that immediately

03:08.040 --> 03:10.964
after the detonation
of one of these weapons,

03:11.080 --> 03:13.560
we would lose all sources of power.

03:13.680 --> 03:15.842
Electricity would cease to exist.

03:15.960 --> 03:20.124
The Internet would go down,
and along with that, the banking system.

03:28.720 --> 03:30.210
All clear.

03:30.320 --> 03:32.243
Search the room.

03:32.360 --> 03:34.806
Just who made you the expert on this?

03:34.920 --> 03:37.526
You don't have to be an expert
to understand this.

03:37.640 --> 03:40.325
You just have to read
your own damn findings.

03:40.440 --> 03:42.044
According to your report,

03:42.200 --> 03:46.444
90% of the American population
will die in the first 12 months.

03:46.560 --> 03:49.848
Enough, we're done.
Pressing matters need to be addressed.

03:50.000 --> 03:54.085
I want you to pass the Shield Act,
which will harden the grid in our country.

03:54.200 --> 03:56.328
I came here to call you to action.

04:02.720 --> 04:04.961
What you got?

04:05.080 --> 04:08.402
Some small-calibre weapons
and a rabbit gun.

04:09.280 --> 04:10.930
Let's bag 'em up.

04:13.080 --> 04:14.923
We don't have time for this.

04:15.040 --> 04:18.930
You had time to pass
the National Defense Authorization Act

04:19.040 --> 04:23.762
to give the President the power
to declare martial law for any reason,

04:23.880 --> 04:26.611
to give him the power
to arrest any American

04:26.720 --> 04:29.724
by simply accusing them of terrorism,

04:29.840 --> 04:34.528
imprisoning them indefinitely
without charges and no legal counsel.

04:34.640 --> 04:36.449
This was just a funding bill.

04:36.560 --> 04:39.211
You have your facts sorely misplaced.

04:43.840 --> 04:45.808
What's wrong with you?

04:47.040 --> 04:50.089
This. This doesn't look
like some al-Qaeda hideout.

04:50.200 --> 04:54.285
Looks more like my apartment
than some mud hut in Fallujah.

04:54.400 --> 04:56.641
You think too much, eh.

04:56.760 --> 04:59.650
You got a shitty apartment, then.

04:59.760 --> 05:01.922
This hearing is over.

05:02.040 --> 05:04.691
Who do you think you are,
coming in to this committee

05:04.800 --> 05:09.283
and making a mockery
of our elected leaders, Mr. Grey?

05:09.400 --> 05:11.368
I'm an American citizen who's fed up

05:11.480 --> 05:14.643
with an out-of-control,
dictatorial government.

05:14.760 --> 05:17.240
Don't think, Mr. Grey,
that we don't know what you're up to,

05:17.360 --> 05:20.364
stockpiling food, weapons, fuel.

05:20.480 --> 05:24.201
The National Defense Authorization Act
is there to stop domestic terrorists,

05:24.320 --> 05:28.325
threats to this country,
and people like you.

05:28.440 --> 05:30.169
I am an American.

05:30.280 --> 05:31.964
I am a patriot.

05:32.080 --> 05:34.731
You, sir, are nothing but a traitor.

05:34.840 --> 05:36.842
Son...

05:38.280 --> 05:43.411
I've never seen anything like that in my life.
That man's a threat to this country.

05:51.680 --> 05:54.923
That little rant will be
all over the news tonight.

05:55.080 --> 05:57.606
This plays into our hands.

05:57.720 --> 06:00.803
The American news media has our narrative,

06:00.960 --> 06:02.564
and in that narrative,

06:02.680 --> 06:06.890
Charlie Grey is perfectly playing
the role of right-wing extremist.

06:07.000 --> 06:10.846
The stigma of that label will stop up
the ears of the American public

06:10.960 --> 06:13.725
faster than any propaganda
we could fashion.

06:16.280 --> 06:18.931
- Lieutenant Lane.
- Sir?

06:19.040 --> 06:21.691
Have your men clear
and safety their weapons.

06:21.800 --> 06:24.690
There'll be a debriefing at 20:45.
Do you copy?

06:24.800 --> 06:27.167
- Yes, sir.
- Very well.

06:29.280 --> 06:33.205
But what if even a small percentage
of the population were to...

06:33.320 --> 06:35.209
awaken?

06:35.320 --> 06:37.482
By that time, it'll be too late.

06:37.600 --> 06:39.728
Let's just get word out
through the proper channels

06:39.840 --> 06:42.730
to the American brass
who understand the mission.

06:42.880 --> 06:46.885
Seems our testing
of certain units has gone well.

06:47.000 --> 06:51.210
We rig up a few of the Russians
and the Chinese and integrate them.

06:51.320 --> 06:54.244
That will be the perfect litmus test.

07:06.520 --> 07:09.091
Isn't that a good boy.
You're Mommy's good boy?

07:09.240 --> 07:12.403
Yes, you are. Yes, you are.

07:12.520 --> 07:14.568
You certainly are.

07:15.430 --> 07:18.035
Okay. Oh, got a phone call.

07:18.160 --> 07:20.882
Gonna answer the phone?
Can Mama answer the phone?

07:22.800 --> 07:25.406
Oh, hey, Charlie. How's it goin'?

07:25.520 --> 07:29.081
No, no, I'm just, uh,
workin' with the horses.

07:30.040 --> 07:31.804
Sure.

07:32.120 --> 07:34.566
Oh, no, no,
I've already taken care of the cake.

07:34.720 --> 07:36.290
Yeah, I thought we discussed that.

07:36.400 --> 07:38.050
Uh-huh.

07:38.160 --> 07:39.924
Well, what time?

07:40.040 --> 07:42.727
Oh, that's perfect. Sure.

07:44.362 --> 07:47.361
You know Mama. I don't think we're gonna
be able to pull the wool over her eyes,

07:47.480 --> 07:49.448
but we can certainly try.

07:49.560 --> 07:51.289
All right, then.

07:51.400 --> 07:54.324
All right, I'll see ya later. Bye.

08:03.960 --> 08:06.645
When you suppose
we're gonna go back to base?

08:06.760 --> 08:09.127
I'm tired of using porta-potties.

08:09.240 --> 08:11.481
Don't know. When we're told.

08:12.840 --> 08:15.047
Mm, you'd think that the government

08:15.160 --> 08:19.688
would put a little extra effort
into an architect or something.

08:20.600 --> 08:23.490
- It's weird.
- What more do we need?

08:23.600 --> 08:27.844
Got a couple tents, some tins, storage,
vacant town down the way.

08:27.960 --> 08:29.849
Better than bein' at base.

08:31.440 --> 08:33.090
Yeah, I guess so.

08:33.240 --> 08:36.482
I-I just really wanna know
what's in that building.

08:37.400 --> 08:39.129
Our comm system sucks,

08:39.240 --> 08:43.529
and look at all that hardware
just sprouting through the roof.

08:44.280 --> 08:46.009
It doesn't make sense.

08:46.120 --> 08:50.728
- It's above my pay grade.
- Yeah, well, I may have to take a peek.

08:50.880 --> 08:53.850
All right, Sherlock. You need a new hobby.

08:53.960 --> 08:55.928
Oh, this ain't a hobby.

08:56.040 --> 08:57.769
I got it all figured out.

08:57.880 --> 09:00.087
- Is that right?
- Mm-hmm.

09:00.200 --> 09:04.683
You see...
private eyes can make some bank.

09:04.800 --> 09:07.644
Just, uh, follow around a cheatin' husband,

09:07.760 --> 09:10.206
take some pictures, set up some bugs.

09:10.360 --> 09:12.283
Some easy money.

09:12.400 --> 09:16.246
Well, if I ever need one,
you'll be my guy.

09:16.360 --> 09:19.284
That's really sweet,
I'll give you a good rate.

09:19.400 --> 09:20.925
Well, all that sounds great,

09:21.080 --> 09:24.402
but I could use a hot shower
and a nice scrubber.

09:43.240 --> 09:45.971
You think they'd try
to be less conspicuous.

09:46.080 --> 09:47.969
They want us to see it.

09:48.080 --> 09:51.562
Yeah, well I'd like to take a potshot
and clip the damn thing.

09:51.680 --> 09:54.570
Sam, now what have you done?

09:54.680 --> 09:58.241
Oh, you know me,
can't keep a match out of my hands.

09:58.360 --> 09:59.964
I can take pretty much anyone,

10:00.120 --> 10:03.169
but it's gonna be my chemistry
degree that kills me.

10:05.640 --> 10:09.531
Okay, boss,
you're gonna have to take this one.

10:09.640 --> 10:12.325
I can't deal with a headache and a burn.

10:12.440 --> 10:14.886
I'll be in my cave.

10:16.000 --> 10:18.367
How's my favorite liberal state rep?

10:18.480 --> 10:21.131
Fine, Charlie.
Just dropping Penny off at school.

10:21.240 --> 10:25.404
Listen, Charlie, about the hearing.
We need to talk damage control.

10:25.560 --> 10:29.167
No damage on our end, Roger.
Nothing unintended anyway.

10:29.280 --> 10:31.248
Charlie, this is serious.

10:31.400 --> 10:35.530
We need to talk face to face.
Listen to me. This is important.

10:35.640 --> 10:39.929
Fine, we're gonna have
a small party for Betty.

10:40.040 --> 10:42.008
I'll have Sam send you over the details.

10:42.160 --> 10:46.643
It'll give you a chance to see a nice drone
some people from Washington sent over.

10:46.760 --> 10:50.526
Drone? Why would they send
a drone over your ranch?

10:50.640 --> 10:52.244
I just...

10:52.360 --> 10:55.170
Look, just have Sam
send me the details, please.

10:56.840 --> 11:00.526
Dad, why do you waste your time
with that fascist conspiracy nut?

11:00.680 --> 11:02.887
Well, Penny, you been
around the game long enough,

11:03.000 --> 11:06.721
you know a campaign costs money.
I got this guy Harris by only four points.

11:06.840 --> 11:09.320
I just need...

11:09.480 --> 11:13.041
Look, politics aside,
Charlie and I go way, way back.

11:13.160 --> 11:16.209
He looks at things one way.
I look at things another way.

11:16.360 --> 11:18.966
I wouldn't go so far
as to call him a fascist.

11:19.080 --> 11:21.128
Hey, Charlie's always been good to you.

11:21.280 --> 11:24.727
Well, being good and being right
are completely separate things.

11:24.840 --> 11:28.208
I mean, I've seen his ramblings
on the Internet. It's disgusting.

11:28.320 --> 11:31.563
All those accusations about the president.
I mean, a man as rich as Grey,

11:31.680 --> 11:35.526
and there's all these poor people in the area
and he just hoards it to himself.

11:35.640 --> 11:38.041
A halfway decent man
would spread his wealth around.

11:38.160 --> 11:42.051
Well, he does.
He's actually my largest donor.

11:45.800 --> 11:49.009
We're doing a teach-in at a women's clinic.
That is if your patron, Mr. Grey,

11:49.120 --> 11:51.407
doesn't mind that I choose
what to do with my body.

11:51.560 --> 11:55.087
No, all right, all right.
Can you pause your lecture long enough

11:55.200 --> 11:58.966
to give your old sell-out dad
a kiss goodbye, please?

11:59.800 --> 12:01.370
Love you, Dad.

12:22.720 --> 12:24.927
Feels good to hold
the real thing in your hand.

12:25.040 --> 12:27.042
There's a joke in there.

12:27.160 --> 12:30.767
You know what I mean.
Real bullets, not that paintball crap.

12:30.880 --> 12:33.042
Gentlemen, let's do this on three, huh?

12:33.160 --> 12:35.128
One...

12:35.240 --> 12:36.844
two...

12:38.880 --> 12:40.564
Whoo!

12:40.680 --> 12:43.650
I win. Y'all cheated,
and I still whooped you both.

12:43.760 --> 12:48.209
- My little sister shoots better than y'all.
- Frankie? Yeah, she probably does.

12:48.320 --> 12:51.483
Well, my guy's dancing with his 72 virgins.

12:51.600 --> 12:54.649
That's an excessive amount
of inexperienced women.

12:54.760 --> 12:56.762
Dead either way.

13:26.480 --> 13:28.448
That's not one of our vehicles.

13:28.560 --> 13:30.608
UN logo on the side.

13:30.720 --> 13:33.803
Yeah, but what the hell
is the UN doin' here?

13:35.160 --> 13:39.643
There's gotta be some good reason.
When we need to know, we'll know.

13:40.720 --> 13:43.849
How 'bout best two outta three? Huh?

13:55.320 --> 13:58.210
On behalf of the President
of the United States, welcome.

13:58.320 --> 14:01.244
There are two attachés each for you
on the outskirts of the camp.

14:01.400 --> 14:03.801
If you would, please.

14:11.800 --> 14:13.370
Hey, Mama.

14:26.640 --> 14:28.085
Hey, Mama.

14:28.200 --> 14:31.170
I tell you, there is somethin' wrong
with that girl out there.

14:31.280 --> 14:34.921
Seems like anything with a barrel
or a blade is a toy to her.

14:35.540 --> 14:38.840
Probably 'cause she's just like her mother.

14:40.080 --> 14:44.130
Mama... you were supposed
to start takin' your medicine.

14:45.680 --> 14:47.045
I'm done.

14:47.800 --> 14:50.406
Done... done with what?
This isn't even open.

14:52.280 --> 14:57.207
All the pills, the shots,
the scans, the probes, everything.

14:57.800 --> 15:00.963
I still got cancer.
It's not going anywhere.

15:01.080 --> 15:03.765
- Mama.
- Besides...

15:03.920 --> 15:06.890
I feel great, just great.

15:07.880 --> 15:11.202
From now on, I'm livin' on faith.

15:11.320 --> 15:13.368
It serves me real good.

15:13.480 --> 15:16.962
I know, Mama, but...
but you can't just give up.

15:17.080 --> 15:18.650
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

15:18.760 --> 15:21.127
Now when did I ever gave up?

15:21.240 --> 15:22.730
Not me.

15:22.840 --> 15:24.888
I'm done, Grandma.

15:25.000 --> 15:26.650
Oh, Frankie, thank you, darlin'.

15:26.760 --> 15:29.809
Listen, you've done enough for today.
That's it, okay?

15:29.920 --> 15:32.685
Frankie, would you please back me up here
and explain to your grandmother

15:32.800 --> 15:35.644
that she needs to start takin' her medicine?

15:35.760 --> 15:38.570
Girls, girls, listen to me.

15:38.680 --> 15:41.001
And listen good.

15:41.120 --> 15:42.724
Look around.

15:42.840 --> 15:45.161
Look at the world.

15:45.280 --> 15:48.921
In my dreams... I see it.

15:49.040 --> 15:52.169
I see it just as plain as day.

15:52.280 --> 15:55.409
World's goin' to hell in a hand basket.

15:56.640 --> 15:59.564
Charlie sees it, too.
And when it comes, Frankie,

15:59.680 --> 16:03.287
you take your mother
and you just get over to Charlie's.

16:03.440 --> 16:07.809
He will be able to protect you,
and he will want to.

16:09.520 --> 16:12.330
Who's gonna protect Brandon?

16:12.440 --> 16:15.250
God will protect Brandon.

16:17.320 --> 16:20.403
Listen up, domestic threats
have now become

16:20.520 --> 16:22.682
a top priority of this administration.

16:22.800 --> 16:26.282
Subsequently, we will be starting
a series of training exercises,

16:26.400 --> 16:30.121
military operations in urban terrain.

16:30.240 --> 16:31.526
Lieutenant Lane, you have a question.

16:31.640 --> 16:35.850
Yes, sir. Colonel, what domestic
threats are we talking about?

16:35.960 --> 16:37.928
There are a variety of scenarios.

16:38.040 --> 16:40.805
Not the least of which,
mass attacks on the homeland.

16:40.920 --> 16:42.809
At which time it will become necessary

16:42.920 --> 16:47.528
to protect the majority of the citizens
against the minority of the extremists.

16:47.640 --> 16:49.688
And who defines the term extremist, sir?

16:49.800 --> 16:53.043
That would be your Commander-in-Chief,
Joint Chiefs of Staff.

16:53.160 --> 16:55.686
That fits with your approval, Lieutenant?

16:57.360 --> 16:58.930
Perfectly, sir.

16:59.080 --> 17:01.924
Very well.
Local law enforcement will be...

17:02.080 --> 17:05.971
- Is that good, boss?
- ...and unable to stop armed gangs or militia.

17:06.079 --> 17:11.530
Every man, woman and child in America
will be looking to each and every one of you

17:11.640 --> 17:14.803
and everyone under your command
to restore order.

17:14.920 --> 17:16.330
Will you be ready?

17:16.440 --> 17:18.010
- Yes, sir.
- I did not hear you.

17:18.119 --> 17:19.201
Yes, sir!

17:19.319 --> 17:20.924
- Hoorah!
- Hoorah!

17:21.040 --> 17:22.565
Dismissed.

17:35.160 --> 17:37.288
Malcolm...

17:37.400 --> 17:39.323
you have a lot on your mind.

17:40.560 --> 17:45.805
A sustainable population of our planet
is no more than 500 million.

17:45.960 --> 17:48.486
And we're willing to kill 7 billion.

17:48.600 --> 17:53.242
Well, most of those lives...
aren't worth living.

17:54.160 --> 17:59.485
A mass of humanity
in Africa, India and China,

17:59.640 --> 18:01.404
they live in squalor.

18:02.640 --> 18:04.563
They'd be better off dead.

18:04.680 --> 18:07.251
The world would be better off without them.

18:07.360 --> 18:10.807
- And America will be first.
- Yes, well...

18:10.920 --> 18:14.527
as our friend Henry Kissinger said,

18:14.640 --> 18:19.851
"A strong America is the only thing
standing in the way of a new world order."

18:20.520 --> 18:23.888
We have foreign troops on the ground now,

18:24.040 --> 18:26.361
under the UN banner.

18:26.480 --> 18:28.960
The country only needs a little chaos.

18:30.240 --> 18:33.244
The American people are resilient.

18:33.360 --> 18:36.569
What's to come if the citizens rise up?

18:37.240 --> 18:42.246
Yes, well, when parents
see their children starving,

18:42.360 --> 18:44.761
families hauled away to FEMA camps

18:44.880 --> 18:47.247
for imprisonment or worse,

18:47.360 --> 18:51.126
then yes, yes,
we expect some resistance...

18:51.240 --> 18:53.447
at first.

18:53.560 --> 18:57.281
But the vanity of nationalism
will quickly fade.

18:57.400 --> 19:00.085
The people will beg for help,

19:00.240 --> 19:02.288
any help.

19:02.400 --> 19:06.166
These are but the birth pangs of change.

19:06.280 --> 19:10.569
Hmm, birth pangs of a new world order.

19:33.120 --> 19:34.922
The sign says River Street.

19:35.040 --> 19:38.203
So how do we tell a tango
versus a friendly?

19:38.360 --> 19:41.682
You heard the Colonel.
Consider all armed a target.

19:41.800 --> 19:45.441
I don't know, Lieutenant,
this is like training in Amer...

19:45.560 --> 19:47.085
In America, I know.

19:47.200 --> 19:50.841
Let me remind you,
the Boston bombers were U.S. citizens.

19:51.000 --> 19:53.606
Um, not so sure about that.

20:19.770 --> 20:22.535
United States Army.

20:28.800 --> 20:31.371
Hey, there. How can I help you gentlemen?

20:31.480 --> 20:33.926
My name is Lieutenant Lane.
Martial law has been declared.

20:34.040 --> 20:36.520
Under martial law,
we need to know if you have

20:36.640 --> 20:38.881
any weapons in your home
or on your possession.

20:39.000 --> 20:40.809
Oh, no, not a gun guy.

20:40.920 --> 20:43.526
Never really understood
that whole right-to-carry thing.

20:43.640 --> 20:46.450
You and the police are the only ones
that need it anyway.

20:46.560 --> 20:49.006
Feel free to come in and check.
My name's David.

20:49.120 --> 20:51.168
All right, thank you, David.

20:51.280 --> 20:53.123
Just a random check, sir.

20:53.240 --> 20:56.005
Do you know of anyone in the neighbourhood
who may have weapons?

20:56.120 --> 20:57.610
Well, I don't want to get involved,

20:57.720 --> 21:00.929
but my next-door neighbour,
he's a bit patriotic.

21:01.040 --> 21:04.044
He's got NRA stickers.
He's a bit of a gun nut.

21:04.200 --> 21:06.771
Quite frankly, I'm frightened of him.

21:09.440 --> 21:12.922
- We're good.
- Thank you, sir. Sorry for the intrusion.

21:13.080 --> 21:16.607
Oh, no problem,
just happy you're here to help us.

21:21.440 --> 21:23.886
Well, that wasn't weird at all.

21:24.000 --> 21:26.401
It was like, uh, Stepford Wives,

21:26.520 --> 21:28.841
but with a dude.

21:28.960 --> 21:31.645
Let's just knock this out.
Stay on mission.

21:32.880 --> 21:34.769
Perfect.

21:34.880 --> 21:37.087
"Stay on mission."

21:38.160 --> 21:40.447
Who is this platoon leader?

21:40.560 --> 21:42.767
Lieutenant Brandon Lane.

21:42.880 --> 21:45.850
Third in a line of good military men.

21:45.960 --> 21:48.850
Mother's a veterinarian.
Sister's 15 years old.

21:48.960 --> 21:52.282
Shoot the eyes out of a turkey
at a hundred yards.

21:52.400 --> 21:56.724
Father was KIA in Iraq.
Anything else you need to know?

21:56.840 --> 22:00.401
You can see he has the hearts of his men.

22:00.520 --> 22:04.161
If you have his, you have theirs.

22:05.440 --> 22:07.727
- If not...
- Yeah, I get it.

22:07.840 --> 22:09.285
He's a wildcard,

22:09.400 --> 22:11.482
but he's tamable.

22:32.240 --> 22:34.846
United States Army.
Please come to the door.

22:36.120 --> 22:39.841
- What can I help you with?
- Please just come to the door, sir.

22:47.400 --> 22:50.404
- You're on private property.
- I understand that, sir.

22:50.520 --> 22:53.410
But under martial law,
we need to know if you have any weapons

22:53.520 --> 22:56.251
inside your home or on your person.

22:56.360 --> 22:58.840
Well, as a matter of fact, I do.

22:58.960 --> 23:01.566
All legal, all licensed.

23:01.680 --> 23:04.923
- Just like the Second Amendment allows.
- I understand that, sir,

23:05.040 --> 23:07.088
But martial law has been declared,

23:07.200 --> 23:09.680
and under the National
Defense Authorization Act,

23:09.800 --> 23:12.531
I am going to send in my men
to search for and confiscate

23:12.640 --> 23:15.166
any weapons that you have.

23:18.400 --> 23:20.528
No, you're not.

23:21.920 --> 23:25.686
- Don't do that again, sir.
- Get the hell off of my property.

23:25.840 --> 23:27.365
I'm gonna ask you one more time.

23:27.480 --> 23:30.370
Do you have any weapons
inside or on your person?

23:30.480 --> 23:32.528
I already told you I do.

23:32.680 --> 23:35.809
Now I'll use them, too,
if you don't get the hell off of my property!

23:35.920 --> 23:38.810
Sir, martial law has been declared.

23:38.920 --> 23:41.491
I don't give a spit
about your martial law.

23:41.600 --> 23:44.444
- Get the hell off my property.
- Go, go, go.

23:44.840 --> 23:46.524
Ah!

23:48.500 --> 23:50.643
Got me in the nuts.

23:58.240 --> 24:01.323
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm sorry, man, I'm just doin'...

24:01.440 --> 24:05.161
- Who told you you could shoot one of my men?
- I'm doing what they told me to do, man.

24:05.280 --> 24:07.442
I'm a crisis actor.

24:09.440 --> 24:11.169
Ben.

24:11.280 --> 24:12.805
Go.

24:14.080 --> 24:16.128
I'm a crisis actor, man.

24:21.040 --> 24:22.769
This is not my calling.

24:22.880 --> 24:25.121
This is not. I need another job.

24:30.480 --> 24:32.164
- Hey.
- Hey, babe.

24:32.320 --> 24:35.608
- Hey!
- How'd the meeting with Professor Stern go?

24:35.720 --> 24:39.406
Well, he's decided to publish
Feminist and Fabulous.

24:39.520 --> 24:42.330
Oh, my God! Like your own manifesto.

24:42.440 --> 24:46.047
I know, I mean, I couldn't make up
the stuff he was saying to me.

24:46.160 --> 24:49.801
Um, "Your generation finally has the chance
to bury the God and guns culture,"

24:49.920 --> 24:53.208
and I can't even remember what else.

24:54.194 --> 24:55.368
So cool.

24:55.480 --> 24:59.087
You know he's right.
You're gonna change the world.

25:01.240 --> 25:03.288
I'm gonna change the world.

25:10.000 --> 25:11.604
Sir.

25:11.720 --> 25:14.530
- Stand at ease.
- Yes, sir.

25:15.680 --> 25:19.480
You wanna explain to me
what that stunt was you pulled in training?

25:19.600 --> 25:22.843
Sorry, sir. Concerned for my man.
I lost control.

25:23.000 --> 25:25.480
Losing control is not an option, Lieutenant.

25:25.600 --> 25:29.525
Shit happens in exercises
just like it does in the real world.

25:30.840 --> 25:34.606
Now you wanna tell me just exactly
what is bitin' you in the ass?

25:35.360 --> 25:36.771
Sir?

25:36.880 --> 25:39.121
I need to know you're on board
with this program.

25:39.240 --> 25:40.685
Understood, sir.

25:40.800 --> 25:43.565
The last two weeks of our training
has slowly turned into more of...

25:43.680 --> 25:47.002
I explained that.
It's about saving American lives.

25:47.120 --> 25:49.964
Then why did I see a UN vehicle pull up

25:50.080 --> 25:51.844
and two non-Americans get out?

25:51.960 --> 25:53.405
You saluted them both.

25:53.520 --> 25:55.966
They didn't look like allies to me.

25:56.080 --> 25:58.208
That is classified, Lieutenant.

25:58.320 --> 26:03.281
And if I hear you utter a single word
about anything you may or may not have seen,

26:03.400 --> 26:07.371
I will see to it that the only training
you do for the rest of your freakin' life

26:07.480 --> 26:10.245
is push-ups in the brig.
Am I clear, soldier?

26:11.320 --> 26:14.961
- Yes, sir.
- There will be a briefing tomorrow, 07:00.

26:15.080 --> 26:18.129
It will further clarify things.
Do not be late.

26:18.240 --> 26:20.242
- Yes, sir.
- Dismissed.

26:31.840 --> 26:35.049
- Hello?
- Mr. Grey, it's Brandon Lane.

26:35.160 --> 26:37.970
Brandon, how ya doin', son?

26:38.080 --> 26:39.605
I'm, uh...

26:39.720 --> 26:41.324
uh...

26:41.440 --> 26:42.965
What's wrong?

26:43.120 --> 26:46.806
Well, it's just... strange things
have been happening here.

26:46.920 --> 26:48.809
Strange how?

26:48.960 --> 26:51.964
Well, I've seen a UN vehicle come and go,

26:52.080 --> 26:54.924
and there's rumours
of foreign soldiers on base.

26:55.040 --> 26:57.042
- Really?
- Yeah.

26:57.160 --> 27:00.004
And lately our training's been more like...

27:00.120 --> 27:02.122
like urban warfare.

27:02.960 --> 27:05.486
Have they mentioned domestic terrorism?

27:05.640 --> 27:07.404
Yes, sir, they have.

27:07.560 --> 27:09.767
Brandon, listen to me carefully.

27:09.880 --> 27:13.009
You may be having to make
some very difficult decisions.

27:13.120 --> 27:15.009
I'm sorry, Mr. Grey, I gotta go.

27:24.760 --> 27:26.967
Nice ride, sir.

27:29.320 --> 27:31.402
She's my pride and joy.

27:31.520 --> 27:33.522
Goes with me everywhere.

27:33.640 --> 27:37.326
Did you know this little lady right here
has been to Iraq twice?

27:39.480 --> 27:42.768
Colonel, is there a... Mrs. Crane?

27:46.800 --> 27:49.531
Is there a Mrs. Crane?

27:50.320 --> 27:53.210
Oh, there was a Mrs. Crane...

27:53.320 --> 27:56.005
but I got the motorcycle anyway.

27:57.360 --> 27:59.522
Times are changing, Lieutenant.

28:00.520 --> 28:03.444
Better change with 'em.
You get left behind.

28:04.310 --> 28:06.233
I can see that, sir.

28:20.120 --> 28:22.851
Hello, Mr. President.

28:22.960 --> 28:26.521
Operation Dark Star has commenced.

28:29.680 --> 28:33.082
You listen to me very, very carefully,

28:33.200 --> 28:34.929
Mr. President.

28:35.040 --> 28:38.010
You knew damn good and well
when we vetted you

28:38.120 --> 28:40.202
that this day was going to come.

28:40.360 --> 28:44.888
Well, the committee and I
have decided now is the time.

28:48.480 --> 28:51.882
This was a courtesy call,
neither a warning nor a threat.

28:53.160 --> 28:55.401
When you sell your soul,

28:55.520 --> 28:57.522
it's a one-time thing.

28:57.640 --> 28:59.722
There's no going back.

29:00.720 --> 29:03.405
Goodbye, Mr. President.

29:10.360 --> 29:12.806
All right, all right, don't panic.
Just keep the horse upright.

29:12.920 --> 29:15.082
I'm on my way.

29:15.200 --> 29:16.884
I got a horse in breach.

29:17.000 --> 29:20.447
Frankie, Sam's gonna pick ya up and take ya
over to Mr. Grey's house, okay?

29:20.560 --> 29:23.803
Awesome, maybe Sam will let me
use one of her AR-15s.

29:23.920 --> 29:25.046
Good Lord, Frankie.

29:25.200 --> 29:28.249
I'm gonna go ahead and go with Frankie
to Charlie's because...

29:28.360 --> 29:31.842
Look, I know about my surprise birthday cake.
Don't worry about me seeing it.

29:31.960 --> 29:34.566
I think it's great,
just great what you're doin'.

29:34.680 --> 29:38.082
But Charlie and I have some talking to do.

29:38.200 --> 29:42.125
I got a mother that wants to start a militia
and my daughter wants to fight in one.

29:42.240 --> 29:44.561
This is why I became a veterinarian.

29:44.720 --> 29:46.324
- Aha.
- Lord help me.

29:46.440 --> 29:49.091
- I love you.
- I love you, Mama. Bye.

29:49.200 --> 29:52.283
- We're gonna skadoot and skedaddle.
- All right.

29:55.360 --> 29:57.124
Be seated.

29:59.800 --> 30:01.848
By order of the Commander-in-Chief,

30:01.960 --> 30:05.089
we will be cooperating
with the United Nations.

30:05.240 --> 30:07.846
We'll be running joint drills here Stateside.

30:07.960 --> 30:09.883
Colonel, if I may.

30:11.720 --> 30:13.802
Floor is yours, Colonel.

30:18.240 --> 30:20.641
My name is Colonel Kashoid.

30:20.760 --> 30:24.401
I'm here with Colonel Wong
on behalf of the UN.

30:24.520 --> 30:28.889
Our countries have found it beneficial
on a number of different levels

30:29.000 --> 30:33.403
to come together as "friends"
under the United Nations banner

30:33.560 --> 30:37.881
to do joint exercises
in the case of any type

30:38.000 --> 30:41.641
of either natural or civil unrest.

30:52.200 --> 30:54.487
Can I get anything for the birthday girl?

30:54.600 --> 30:57.763
No, thank you. This is doing me just fine.

30:57.880 --> 31:01.885
Charlie, could you sit down
for just a moment, please?

31:03.440 --> 31:05.522
I'd like to talk to you.

31:07.280 --> 31:10.523
I recall very vividly

31:10.680 --> 31:14.685
a radio program in 1950

31:14.800 --> 31:19.806
and this man was testifying
in front of Congress and he said,

31:19.920 --> 31:25.563
"We shall have world government
whether we like it or not.

31:26.640 --> 31:28.404
The only question is,

31:28.520 --> 31:32.491
if world government will be accomplished

31:32.600 --> 31:35.968
by conquest or consent."

31:36.560 --> 31:39.769
He made a bold and stupid statement.

31:39.880 --> 31:42.804
Unfortunately, it's true.

31:44.160 --> 31:47.050
Well, look who I found lurking outside.

31:47.160 --> 31:50.881
Lurking, lurking. What can you expect?
The gentleman's a politician.

31:51.000 --> 31:52.684
Oh, Mama.

31:52.800 --> 31:56.282
Oh, Roger, I just wanted to bust
your chops and keep you humble.

31:56.400 --> 31:59.370
- Always good to see you, ma'am.
- Pleasure's mine.

31:59.520 --> 32:00.806
Charlie?

32:00.920 --> 32:04.970
How is it every campaign I give you money,

32:05.080 --> 32:07.765
but I never vote for you?

32:10.440 --> 32:13.123
Well, I aim to change that.

32:19.440 --> 32:22.967
Is that what's got you all dark
and brooding, Lieutenant?

32:24.120 --> 32:26.566
You have better eyes than you think, Hamm.

32:28.280 --> 32:30.169
She dumped me when I joined.

32:33.720 --> 32:37.281
Now you're sitting here wondering
just what the hell it is you're doing.

32:39.480 --> 32:44.520
You sign up to defend a country
it's... getting hard to recognize.

32:44.640 --> 32:46.722
Something like that?

32:46.840 --> 32:48.808
Yeah, something like that.

32:51.080 --> 32:54.004
That's why I think
you should know about this, sir.

32:54.120 --> 32:55.963
What is it?

32:57.560 --> 33:01.406
It's something I'm gonna put in my footlocker
for when the fit hits the shan.

33:02.120 --> 33:06.011
If something happens to me... it's yours.

33:08.600 --> 33:11.365
I ain't gonna let nothing happen to you.

33:16.160 --> 33:18.162
I'm gonna go put this back.

33:31.440 --> 33:33.522
Release the device.

33:51.680 --> 33:54.081
# Happy birthday to you #

33:54.200 --> 33:55.884
Oh!

33:56.000 --> 33:57.490
Happy birthday, Mama.

33:57.600 --> 33:58.965
I love you.

34:20.800 --> 34:24.407
One of these days I'm gonna learn
how to play this stupid thing.

35:15.280 --> 35:17.123
All the lights are off.

35:17.880 --> 35:21.123
Look, I'm sure it's nothing.
Don't worry about it.

35:22.720 --> 35:25.963
- You're gonna stay with me, right?
- Of course.

35:26.400 --> 35:28.971
I'm not going anywhere, okay?

35:31.680 --> 35:33.250
It happened, didn't it?

35:36.440 --> 35:39.649
I'm not sure, but we'll find out soon.

35:42.740 --> 35:44.961
Something must've hit a transformer.

35:55.240 --> 35:58.130
- We just got hit by an EMP.
- We should go help 'em.

35:58.240 --> 36:02.131
There's nothing we can do, Timmes.
There's no trucks. Nothing works.

36:02.240 --> 36:04.322
Then what's that?

36:07.760 --> 36:09.728
Truck's old school, pre-electronics.

36:09.840 --> 36:12.525
They must've had some protected somewhere.

36:13.320 --> 36:15.448
That's awfully convenient.

36:25.840 --> 36:27.569
We deploy in one hour.

36:27.680 --> 36:31.366
Ready your platoons.
We have support coming from Fort Campbell.

36:31.480 --> 36:33.562
Move out.

36:33.680 --> 36:35.284
Hold up, Colonel.

36:35.400 --> 36:37.084
Sir, what's the mission?

36:39.880 --> 36:42.247
You do not tell me to hold up!

36:42.360 --> 36:43.771
Sir, what is the mission?

36:43.880 --> 36:47.009
Martial law has been declared, Lieutenant.

36:47.120 --> 36:49.407
Martial law? Already? It just happened.

36:49.560 --> 36:50.971
We're gonna have to restore order,

36:51.080 --> 36:54.084
so you tell your men
to get their gear and mount up.

36:54.200 --> 36:56.851
- What is our mission?
- Restore order.

36:56.960 --> 37:00.646
Disarm the population,
subdue resistance at any cost.

37:00.760 --> 37:03.366
There's no way martial law
was declared that quickly.

37:03.480 --> 37:07.530
Lieutenant, you will follow my orders
or I will have you arrested.

37:07.640 --> 37:12.521
Sir, I have sworn to protect and defend
the Constitution of the United States.

37:12.640 --> 37:15.450
I will not fire on innocent
American citizens.

37:15.560 --> 37:18.211
- Then you will die.
- Back off, guys.

37:18.320 --> 37:20.561
Stand down. That's an order.

37:22.880 --> 37:26.123
Now... Colonel...

37:26.240 --> 37:28.720
what to do with him?

37:28.840 --> 37:31.320
Lock him up, we'll deal with him later.

37:31.440 --> 37:34.410
- I'm not going anywhere.
- Bad call, son.

37:42.680 --> 37:44.728
Let's go, guys, come on.

37:44.840 --> 37:47.810
You're dead, Lane.
You don't know what's going on!

37:47.920 --> 37:50.161
You're dead!

37:52.360 --> 37:54.806
Hey, boss. It was an EMP.

37:54.960 --> 37:58.043
Anyone coming down here
won't be with good intentions.

37:58.160 --> 38:01.926
Though I'd say everyone's laying low,
probably riding this out tonight.

38:02.040 --> 38:06.090
Tonight, but give it a day or two.
We've got what they want.

38:06.560 --> 38:09.928
Well, Charlie, thank you again
for letting us stay with you.

38:10.040 --> 38:15.365
Let Sam take you down to your house
to get what you and your family need.

38:15.520 --> 38:19.809
- We could leave before sunup, we're good.
- Okay.

38:19.920 --> 38:22.321
Come on, guys, hurry up, hurry up.

39:53.880 --> 39:55.723
Come here to me.

39:56.600 --> 39:59.410
Come over here to your grandmother.

40:02.920 --> 40:06.208
You know, when I was your age,

40:06.320 --> 40:10.769
I was a tough son of a biscuit eater,
just like you.

40:12.320 --> 40:14.288
Go, your old grandmother's just fine.

40:14.400 --> 40:16.689
- Thanks, Grandma.
- Oh.

40:49.600 --> 40:51.762
Colonel, I think I saw him over here!

41:04.360 --> 41:06.249
Don't let him get away.

41:06.400 --> 41:08.084
Ah!

41:08.200 --> 41:11.090
Battery's dead, now my phone won't work.

41:11.200 --> 41:12.804
It's dead.

41:14.880 --> 41:16.644
Excuse me, ladies.

41:48.316 --> 41:49.710
Aw, sh...

42:19.636 --> 42:21.131
Hello?

42:24.921 --> 42:26.586
Anybody home?

42:30.800 --> 42:32.723
- Hello?
- What do you want?

42:32.840 --> 42:36.128
Please, sir, I'm no trouble.
Just a soldier trying to get home.

42:36.280 --> 42:40.001
- What's your name, boy?
- Brandon Lane. Lieutenant.

42:40.160 --> 42:41.924
Well, I was.

42:42.800 --> 42:45.246
- Lieutenant, huh?
- Yes, sir.

42:46.640 --> 42:49.530
I reckon I got two options with you.

42:49.640 --> 42:52.769
One: I stick a bullet
right here in your face...

42:52.920 --> 42:54.160
Please, sir.

42:54.280 --> 42:59.889
Or two: I figure out
who you are... and what's going on.

43:00.000 --> 43:01.650
Is that what you want?

43:01.760 --> 43:03.922
- Yes, sir.
- Come on in.

43:08.400 --> 43:11.131
Your president has signed
all executive orders

43:11.240 --> 43:15.962
that gives the United Nations full control
of your country and constitution.

43:16.080 --> 43:18.447
We have no constitution.

43:20.480 --> 43:22.369
Dammit.

43:22.480 --> 43:27.042
I knew there was corruption
in Washington, D.C.,

43:27.160 --> 43:29.686
but these sons-of-bitches
are making toilet paper

43:29.800 --> 43:31.723
out of our constitution.

43:31.840 --> 43:33.763
Yeah, for starters.

43:39.600 --> 43:41.841
Now, your friend that had this...

43:43.960 --> 43:46.691
Killed... by those men.

43:46.800 --> 43:48.245
I'm sorry.

43:50.640 --> 43:54.565
But how did this thing survive an EMP attack?

43:55.920 --> 44:00.528
It was in his metal locker,
so... just luck, I guess.

44:04.120 --> 44:05.884
I don't believe in luck.

44:08.720 --> 44:11.690
Your country's going
to the dogs right now, Charlie.

44:11.800 --> 44:15.168
There have been rumours
of FEMA camps being set up.

44:15.280 --> 44:18.204
The beast has reared its ugly head.

44:18.320 --> 44:20.402
It's only North America?

44:20.520 --> 44:23.205
That's what the news is here.

44:23.320 --> 44:26.290
I appreciate any news
you can send our way.

44:26.400 --> 44:28.687
Copy that. Be safe, Charlie.

44:31.200 --> 44:33.567
You need to get me out of here.

44:33.680 --> 44:36.684
- Obviously, your car's dead.
- Yes, it is.

44:38.480 --> 44:40.403
You don't... you don't get it, do you?

44:40.520 --> 44:43.000
I am a state representative.
We are in a crisis.

44:43.120 --> 44:46.488
I need to get back to Austin
and help figure this out.

44:46.600 --> 44:50.650
- Figure what out?
- What we need to do to fix the problem.

44:50.760 --> 44:52.762
You were the problem.

44:52.880 --> 44:55.804
You can kiss your government goodbye.

44:55.960 --> 45:01.251
What, you think a power outage
has just erased our government?

45:01.360 --> 45:04.682
There's a government, all right.
Just not the one you're used to.

45:04.800 --> 45:06.404
That's absurd.

45:06.520 --> 45:10.002
The time to act was
when this problem was preventable.

45:10.120 --> 45:13.329
How? You tell me, Charlie.
How was this preventable?

45:13.480 --> 45:15.608
The Congressional reports I sent you,

45:15.720 --> 45:18.610
all the recommendations of the panel?

45:18.720 --> 45:21.610
You didn't read a single one of
them that I sent you, did you?

45:21.720 --> 45:25.441
Charlie, do you know how much crap
goes across my desk every day?

45:25.560 --> 45:28.291
You've already blown this.

45:28.400 --> 45:31.051
And what you really need
to be thinking about now?

45:31.160 --> 45:33.162
Penny.

45:33.800 --> 45:36.690
Seems like the power
should've been on by now.

45:36.800 --> 45:39.531
Yeah, but no power means
no class tomorrow.

45:39.640 --> 45:43.122
Yeah, I'm getting kind of tired.
I'm gonna go up soon.

45:43.240 --> 45:46.050
Me too. I don't even know what time it is.

45:46.160 --> 45:50.131
Look, I-I bet you the sun's
gonna be up in, like, an hour.

45:50.240 --> 45:52.610
I say we just ride it out.

46:30.920 --> 46:33.321
You thought you could hide from me?

46:38.360 --> 46:40.408
Nightmare.

46:41.400 --> 46:42.811
Yes, sir.

46:42.920 --> 46:45.207
Tough to shake.

46:46.040 --> 46:48.088
Took me years.

46:54.520 --> 46:56.090
Coffee?

46:57.400 --> 46:59.084
Yeah, thanks.

47:05.080 --> 47:07.526
I know it ain't the best, but...

47:12.680 --> 47:14.170
Not so bad.

47:16.800 --> 47:19.326
You're a terrible liar, Lieutenant.

47:20.560 --> 47:22.688
It shows your character.

47:35.920 --> 47:37.684
Thank you.

47:52.330 --> 47:54.032
Charlie?

47:55.880 --> 47:59.282
If that really was an EMP yesterday...

48:00.280 --> 48:03.841
Half-a-million people perished last night.

48:05.200 --> 48:08.090
And things are only gonna get worse.

48:08.200 --> 48:10.567
How could it get worse?

48:11.960 --> 48:13.610
No power.

48:13.720 --> 48:15.848
Everything shuts down.

48:15.960 --> 48:20.568
Hospitals, fuel, travel... Food spoils.

48:21.720 --> 48:25.725
The average American family
only has three days of food.

48:26.480 --> 48:30.371
Hungry people do desperate things
to feed their families.

48:34.640 --> 48:37.564
And all of this could've been prevented?

48:39.040 --> 48:40.883
Yes.

48:47.400 --> 48:50.449
I wish I had more fuel for ya.

48:52.520 --> 48:55.444
It'll be fine, it'll get me going.

48:55.880 --> 49:00.283
Hey, I appreciate the food,
clothes, everything.

49:04.280 --> 49:05.770
Hey.

49:08.200 --> 49:11.921
I don't know what you're gonna
come across on your way home.

49:12.040 --> 49:15.203
I don't even know
what the world looks like now.

49:15.320 --> 49:18.290
And you're holding a powerful truth.

49:19.280 --> 49:23.808
And what you decide to do with it
is going to be very dangerous.

49:24.720 --> 49:26.484
Godspeed.

49:27.120 --> 49:28.963
Thanks, Harlan.

49:37.800 --> 49:39.643
Frankie.

49:40.840 --> 49:43.207
Do you understand what's happening?

49:43.320 --> 49:46.130
No, all I know is the power went out.

49:47.480 --> 49:49.847
You're a smart girl, Frankie.

49:51.000 --> 49:53.207
What do you want?

49:53.320 --> 49:56.881
Tooth-fairy version... or the truth?

49:57.000 --> 49:58.968
I want the truth.

49:59.080 --> 50:01.845
Truth is, this is the time...

50:02.920 --> 50:05.969
...when folks run and hide,

50:06.080 --> 50:09.607
or they pull up their bootstraps
and they fight.

50:10.440 --> 50:12.966
Man, woman, young or old.

50:13.080 --> 50:14.764
I'll fight.

50:16.200 --> 50:17.486
Kelly?

50:17.600 --> 50:19.204
Hey, Mama.

50:20.160 --> 50:21.491
Frankie.

50:31.880 --> 50:36.363
I'm just so afraid of the world
that you're gonna have to grow up in.

50:40.760 --> 50:44.287
I just want my family back together again.

50:44.400 --> 50:47.051
Kelly, baby, come here.

51:18.480 --> 51:21.086
Roger, I need to show you something.

51:21.200 --> 51:25.330
But I can't show the politician
who I don't trust to keep his big mouth shut.

51:25.440 --> 51:29.604
Yes, if it means getting Penny back safely,
absolutely. You have my word.

51:37.440 --> 51:39.044
It's a Faraday cage.

51:39.200 --> 51:41.726
Military's been using 'em since the '50s.

51:41.840 --> 51:44.207
I'm sorry, a... Faraday cage?

51:44.320 --> 51:48.086
It's a building that protects
electronics from an EMP.

51:48.200 --> 51:52.091
Could be as simple
as a jury-rigged trash can or...

51:52.200 --> 51:54.202
well, this.

51:54.560 --> 51:58.963
That chopper, it's what Sam and I
are gonna take to go get Penny.

52:53.200 --> 52:54.725
Hello?

52:54.840 --> 52:56.524
Hey there, friend.

52:57.400 --> 52:59.050
No power here either?

52:59.160 --> 53:00.810
Nope, nada.

53:00.920 --> 53:04.561
I could use some fuel,
enough to fill the tank and the jug.

53:04.680 --> 53:08.082
Might be a little tough.
You know, I need to keep it for the town.

53:08.200 --> 53:11.090
- There's no telling when the power...
- I hear you, no problem.

53:11.200 --> 53:14.647
But... maybe if you sweeten the pot.

53:15.400 --> 53:18.483
- What are you thinking?
- You got any guns?

53:18.600 --> 53:22.491
No, don't let the military bike
fool you, man, I'm a pacifist.

53:24.000 --> 53:25.729
It's gonna take a lot of money, then.

53:26.440 --> 53:28.363
Maybe I got something better.

53:30.920 --> 53:32.809
One ounce of silver.

53:33.560 --> 53:36.325
- Right now, it could be worth a grand.
- Holy shit.

53:36.480 --> 53:38.209
Argh! Ah!

53:43.600 --> 53:46.365
- You can come out now.
- Please don't hurt me.

53:46.480 --> 53:50.121
- You Toby?
- Yeah, this is my store.

53:50.240 --> 53:51.844
What is left of it.

53:51.960 --> 53:55.328
I'm not gonna hurt you.
This big fella have anything to do with this?

53:56.200 --> 53:58.328
Hey, get him, get him!

54:19.280 --> 54:22.329
Toby, can I please have some gas now?

54:51.200 --> 54:54.204
Come on, let's keep looking.
We'll find her.

55:17.680 --> 55:19.603
I say we stay low,

55:19.720 --> 55:22.644
avoid any stray pops coming at us.

55:23.400 --> 55:26.609
- Let's do this.
- Let's do it.

55:37.040 --> 55:39.566
There she is! Get her!

56:44.240 --> 56:46.720
Where's the politician's daughter?

56:51.960 --> 56:53.689
Charlie.

56:54.080 --> 56:56.401
- There she is.
- I've got her.

57:02.320 --> 57:05.511
Shut up, or I'm gonna bash your face in.

57:15.240 --> 57:16.969
Penny!

57:20.840 --> 57:22.330
Penny, get down!

57:30.680 --> 57:34.605
- Penny, I've been looking everywhere for you.
- You left me.

57:34.760 --> 57:37.525
- I'm sorry.
- Penny, we gotta go!

57:44.360 --> 57:45.725
Stay back!

57:53.680 --> 57:55.808
Nice punch.

58:14.080 --> 58:17.129
I wish Mr. Green was here.

58:17.240 --> 58:18.401
Your science teacher?

58:18.520 --> 58:21.763
He used to be a farmer before all this GMO,
Frankenstein food came along.

58:21.880 --> 58:23.370
You know what?

58:23.520 --> 58:26.603
Overwhelming evidence indicates
there are no scientific fact

58:26.720 --> 58:31.044
that GMOs posed any kind of threat,
any kind of danger.

58:31.160 --> 58:32.924
You people, you all live in a bubble.

58:33.040 --> 58:35.088
What do you think
the government's supposed to do...

58:35.240 --> 58:38.642
Our government isn't supposed
to feed anyone. Farmers are.

58:38.760 --> 58:40.250
Hey, Frankie.

58:40.360 --> 58:44.046
I don't think this is the right time
or place for this discussion.

59:05.280 --> 59:08.011
Come in, Lima Romeo.

59:09.200 --> 59:10.770
Go ahead, we read you.

59:10.880 --> 59:13.770
We just crossed
your property line with Penny.

59:13.880 --> 59:17.930
And, Kelly, there's a soldier
making his way to the house.

59:18.040 --> 59:20.691
- Is it Brandon?
- It sure looks like it.

59:20.800 --> 59:22.370
Oh, my God.

59:22.480 --> 59:23.970
Oh...

01:00:03.840 --> 01:00:07.765
You're pretty tough
for a politician's kid. Come on.

01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:33.126
You must've gone through a lot to get here.

01:00:34.480 --> 01:00:35.970
Yes, sir.

01:00:36.080 --> 01:00:38.686
Actually, I've... I've got something

01:00:38.800 --> 01:00:41.770
that's been burning a hole in my pocket.

01:00:41.880 --> 01:00:44.611
This belonged to a good friend of mine,

01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:46.449
a good soldier.

01:00:46.560 --> 01:00:49.404
How'd the recording survive the EMP?

01:00:50.240 --> 01:00:52.811
Been told not to call it luck, so...

01:00:52.960 --> 01:00:54.644
a miracle?

01:00:58.820 --> 01:01:03.604
Colonel, you know with the UN Secretary
and your president getting ready

01:01:03.760 --> 01:01:05.444
to declare martial law,

01:01:05.560 --> 01:01:10.726
your troops must be prepared
to fire on American citizens,

01:01:10.840 --> 01:01:12.569
whether armed or not.

01:01:12.680 --> 01:01:14.603
Yeah, I get it.

01:01:14.720 --> 01:01:16.449
I don't understand.

01:01:16.560 --> 01:01:19.370
I mean, how could... how...?

01:01:19.480 --> 01:01:21.721
Had you been willing,

01:01:21.840 --> 01:01:24.650
you would've known
this stuff was all around.

01:01:24.760 --> 01:01:26.728
It's not a left thing or a right thing.

01:01:26.840 --> 01:01:30.845
Every administration for the last 50 years
has been working towards this,

01:01:30.960 --> 01:01:33.167
whoever's stamping the executive orders.

01:01:33.280 --> 01:01:36.682
I mean, how could they have
kept it a secret for so long?

01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:39.201
Nothing happens by accident.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:41.968
This is a smoking gun.

01:01:43.720 --> 01:01:46.087
And I need to get back to the capital.

01:01:46.200 --> 01:01:50.842
If you're really set on it,
you could probably do some good in Austin.

01:01:50.960 --> 01:01:55.045
It's time to advise the governor
for Texas to secede.

01:01:56.720 --> 01:01:58.848
Do you know what that would take?

01:02:00.720 --> 01:02:04.122
I want you to come with me
to the radio room.

01:02:04.280 --> 01:02:08.410
There's something I want you to hear
that'll help you make your decision.

01:02:15.880 --> 01:02:18.690
In New York and L.A.,
FEMA camps have been set up.

01:02:18.800 --> 01:02:21.371
Chicago looks to be going down fast,

01:02:21.480 --> 01:02:23.323
with looters tearing up the city.

01:02:23.440 --> 01:02:27.764
Those that haven't been detained are going
to be looking for a place of refuge.

01:02:27.880 --> 01:02:30.247
Ian, stand by, please.

01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:34.641
Play it.

01:02:35.280 --> 01:02:38.568
Your president has signed
all executive orders

01:02:38.680 --> 01:02:43.561
that gives the United Nations full control
of your country and constitution.

01:02:43.680 --> 01:02:45.125
We have no constitution.

01:02:45.280 --> 01:02:47.442
Ahem.

01:02:47.560 --> 01:02:50.962
This is Lieutenant Brandon Lane,
United States Army.

01:02:51.120 --> 01:02:55.250
The recording you just heard
was given to me by Sergeant William Hamm.

01:02:55.360 --> 01:02:58.443
He was killed by the men
that you just heard.

01:02:59.160 --> 01:03:00.764
Yes, sir.

01:03:02.120 --> 01:03:04.327
There is only one thing to do, sir.

01:03:04.440 --> 01:03:09.321
I will find Lane, I will bring him here,
and he will publicly confess to this hoax.

01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:16.640
I'm gonna rip his throat out.

01:03:29.200 --> 01:03:31.168
Alone again.

01:03:32.240 --> 01:03:33.969
You're not alone.

01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:38.801
Your dad has the truth now.

01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:42.323
He may be our only chance.

01:03:42.440 --> 01:03:45.649
Things are never gonna be
the same again, are they?

01:03:47.800 --> 01:03:49.723
I don't think so.

01:03:51.640 --> 01:03:54.120
- I'm tired.
- Hold on a sec.

01:03:54.240 --> 01:03:55.765
Please?

01:03:56.960 --> 01:03:58.485
Stay.

01:03:58.960 --> 01:04:00.962
Please stay?

01:04:02.200 --> 01:04:04.362
That's what I said to Justin.

01:04:05.120 --> 01:04:07.521
To my mom.

01:04:10.720 --> 01:04:12.722
That's what I said to you.

01:04:13.400 --> 01:04:17.564
Can I remind you... you're the one
that ended things between us.

01:04:18.120 --> 01:04:21.329
What was I supposed to do,
just... wait around while...

01:04:21.440 --> 01:04:23.408
Yeah, you were.

01:04:23.960 --> 01:04:27.521
Until when?
Until you came back in a body bag?

01:04:29.920 --> 01:04:32.400
I couldn't face that.

01:04:32.520 --> 01:04:34.648
I'm sorry, I couldn't.

01:04:42.320 --> 01:04:44.209
I loved you.

01:04:44.960 --> 01:04:46.564
I never stopped.

01:04:48.320 --> 01:04:50.448
I never will.

01:05:06.160 --> 01:05:08.242
Sergeant Timmes.

01:05:10.480 --> 01:05:14.405
Lieutenant Lane is a... deserter.

01:05:15.440 --> 01:05:17.681
A domestic terrorist.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.970
Is he really worth all this suffering?

01:05:25.520 --> 01:05:27.682
Help me stop this.

01:05:29.520 --> 01:05:31.682
Tell me where he went.

01:05:33.400 --> 01:05:35.687
How am I supposed to know?

01:05:37.680 --> 01:05:41.526
You served with him for three years,
you expect me to believe that?

01:05:50.800 --> 01:05:52.484
Go to hell.

01:05:53.080 --> 01:05:54.491
Again.

01:05:57.800 --> 01:06:00.690
With just a few more people
we could button this place down.

01:06:00.800 --> 01:06:03.929
I agree, we don't need to stress our resources.
How many are you thinking?

01:06:04.040 --> 01:06:06.566
I-I'd say three more would work.

01:06:06.680 --> 01:06:11.242
Afghanistan, one small squad could be
more effective than an entire company.

01:06:11.400 --> 01:06:13.767
- Sam?
- I know a guy.

01:06:13.880 --> 01:06:16.611
J.D. He lives in town.
He's pretty set up for now.

01:06:16.720 --> 01:06:18.722
But I'm not sure for how long.

01:06:18.840 --> 01:06:24.131
His wife and he both serve in the military,
so they're good, she's a badass.

01:06:24.240 --> 01:06:27.926
- Yeah, I know J.D. and Sandra.
- I volunteer. Sam already taught me how...

01:06:28.040 --> 01:06:29.610
No.

01:06:29.720 --> 01:06:31.529
Then what about Mr. Green?

01:06:31.640 --> 01:06:34.803
- You said he was a farmer.
- Before that, he was a policeman.

01:06:34.920 --> 01:06:38.129
That's a useful combination of skills.

01:06:38.240 --> 01:06:40.766
Sam, call on J.D. and his wife.

01:06:40.880 --> 01:06:43.167
Frankie, I'll find Mr. Green.

01:06:43.280 --> 01:06:46.284
We've got to harden
our defences while we can.

01:06:58.200 --> 01:07:01.807
Yeah, it'd be nice to have a bunch
of these, but it's a lot of digging.

01:07:01.920 --> 01:07:04.571
Yeah, it is. We can handle that.

01:07:04.680 --> 01:07:07.843
Positioned accurately,
this could be highly effective,

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.765
I think I might have an idea
on how we can get

01:07:10.920 --> 01:07:13.571
a little extra bang for our buck
with the spider holes.

01:07:13.680 --> 01:07:17.321
Still making killing machines
out of dental floss and toothpicks?

01:07:17.440 --> 01:07:19.044
Always.

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:21.570
Uh, Frankie?

01:07:25.800 --> 01:07:28.509
Gus, how are ya?

01:07:29.360 --> 01:07:30.691
Oh, yeah.

01:07:37.760 --> 01:07:39.888
J.D.? Really nice to meet you.

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.128
Thank you. Nice to meet you.

01:07:42.240 --> 01:07:43.890
We're really glad you're here.

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.287
Thanks for having us. We're here to help.

01:07:46.400 --> 01:07:48.402
We're stronger together.

01:07:48.520 --> 01:07:51.091
Okay, guys, there's two primary points.

01:07:51.200 --> 01:07:54.363
First of all is the compound
where we're located right now.

01:07:54.480 --> 01:07:58.326
The other one is a Faraday cage,
which contains our ammunition and supplies.

01:08:12.600 --> 01:08:14.841
Now we're talkin'.

01:08:14.960 --> 01:08:16.484
The perimeter's secure, right?

01:08:16.600 --> 01:08:19.001
We have fencing all the way around,
two points of entry?

01:08:19.120 --> 01:08:22.805
Perimeter's secure. However,
we've got to guard the fence line,

01:08:22.920 --> 01:08:26.720
because it is long, it can be
cut through or driven through.

01:08:59.399 --> 01:09:01.448
Damn.

01:09:01.560 --> 01:09:03.688
That's good.

01:09:23.200 --> 01:09:25.122
Oh, hey.

01:09:28.479 --> 01:09:30.969
- All right.
- Mama?

01:09:33.479 --> 01:09:35.846
Uh, Mama? Mama?

01:09:40.080 --> 01:09:41.923
- Cheers!
- America, baby.

01:09:42.040 --> 01:09:43.529
America.

01:09:55.440 --> 01:09:58.171
Here. Take mine.

01:10:01.400 --> 01:10:03.084
Thank you.

01:10:05.970 --> 01:10:08.337
That's better.

01:10:12.200 --> 01:10:13.725
Charlie?

01:10:16.880 --> 01:10:18.211
Why us?

01:10:19.400 --> 01:10:21.562
Why are you taking us in?

01:10:22.720 --> 01:10:24.529
I care about you,

01:10:24.640 --> 01:10:27.086
and I care about your children.

01:10:28.240 --> 01:10:30.561
The world's a different place.

01:10:32.800 --> 01:10:35.770
Who knows what tomorrow's gonna bring?

01:10:39.520 --> 01:10:42.444
Oh, that's hot! That's hot, that's hot!

01:10:42.560 --> 01:10:46.360
Oh, that's hot! Oh, that's hot! Oh! Oh!

01:10:46.480 --> 01:10:49.245
Oh, my God! Are you okay?

01:10:50.400 --> 01:10:54.803
- What the heck was that?
- That was a... miscalculation.

01:10:54.920 --> 01:10:57.924
What...? A mi... a miscalculation?

01:10:59.880 --> 01:11:02.406
Ah, the air pressure wasn't quite right.

01:11:02.920 --> 01:11:05.651
- What the...?
- Sam, what is that thing?

01:11:05.760 --> 01:11:10.004
Oh, it's a Molotov-cocktail launcher.
I call it the "Molotovenator."

01:11:10.160 --> 01:11:12.322
Just got a couple tweaks. Wanna come see?

01:11:12.440 --> 01:11:13.930
What?

01:11:22.080 --> 01:11:24.287
Let's get this garden finished.

01:12:03.600 --> 01:12:07.127
Uniform November
at the runway gate, do you copy?

01:12:07.240 --> 01:12:09.811
Ten-four. Did you say Uniform November?

01:12:09.920 --> 01:12:12.924
Affirmative, sector one! Approaching fast!

01:12:17.920 --> 01:12:21.003
- How many?
- I don't know, maybe three, four vehicles.

01:12:21.120 --> 01:12:22.963
I'm hauling ass to the gate!

01:12:23.080 --> 01:12:26.926
United Nations, but I guarantee
this is not a social call.

01:12:29.680 --> 01:12:33.730
Get down to section one now.
Penny, take Betty to the radio room.

01:12:35.720 --> 01:12:37.449
Wh-where's Frankie?

01:12:49.640 --> 01:12:51.563
- Hey, guys?
- Stall 'em.

01:12:51.720 --> 01:12:53.484
We're getting into position.

01:12:53.600 --> 01:12:57.969
All right, what do you want me
to stall them with, my vivacious personality?

01:12:59.120 --> 01:13:01.930
Frankie? Gus, is Frankie with you?

01:13:07.960 --> 01:13:10.440
Gus! I can't find Frankie.

01:13:10.560 --> 01:13:14.645
She's gonna be okay. J.D.'s waiting
for her at the bottom of the hill.

01:13:14.760 --> 01:13:16.285
I need you.

01:13:16.400 --> 01:13:18.129
Okay.

01:13:18.240 --> 01:13:19.446
Okay.

01:13:20.440 --> 01:13:21.726
Okay.

01:13:43.320 --> 01:13:45.243
Stay here, okay?

01:13:46.640 --> 01:13:48.722
Okay.

01:13:48.840 --> 01:13:52.128
- Keep an eye on Penny.
- Sure, okay.

01:13:52.280 --> 01:13:55.727
- You know where the guns are.
- You bet.

01:13:55.840 --> 01:13:59.606
We're gonna teach these bastards
they can't mess with our country.

01:14:22.040 --> 01:14:23.724
Everyone, take your positions.

01:14:41.880 --> 01:14:44.565
My name is Colonel Kashoid,

01:14:44.680 --> 01:14:48.287
Commander of United Nations
Special Brigade.

01:14:48.400 --> 01:14:50.767
I'm here to arrest Lieutenant Brandon Lane

01:14:50.920 --> 01:14:53.287
on charges of murder...

01:14:53.400 --> 01:14:55.050
and desertion.

01:14:55.160 --> 01:14:58.767
You ought to hand him over to me
immediately.

01:14:58.880 --> 01:15:03.010
I'm sorry, um,
what did you say your name was?

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.162
- Kashoid.
- Gesundheit.

01:15:07.160 --> 01:15:10.289
- This is not a joke.
- Yeah, well...

01:15:10.440 --> 01:15:13.250
It's just your name. Kashoid!

01:15:16.160 --> 01:15:17.730
Bad joke.

01:15:17.840 --> 01:15:19.888
I assure you, I am not joking.

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.651
Yeah, okay, I got it,
you're serious, all right.

01:15:22.760 --> 01:15:25.206
But I'm curious.

01:15:25.320 --> 01:15:28.403
Who or what gave you the right
to come down here

01:15:28.520 --> 01:15:30.761
and make these ridiculous demands?

01:15:30.920 --> 01:15:35.847
The laws of your land by your president
and declaration of martial law.

01:15:35.960 --> 01:15:39.043
Okay, well, I'm not an attorney, Mr. Russia,

01:15:39.160 --> 01:15:43.051
but it'll be a hot day in Siberia
before we turn Brandon Lane over to you.

01:15:43.160 --> 01:15:46.721
Apparently you are not caught up
on the laws your president has signed:

01:15:46.840 --> 01:15:50.765
the National Defense Authorization Act,
Executive Order 13603,

01:15:50.880 --> 01:15:52.848
approved by your Congress.

01:15:52.960 --> 01:15:56.328
That's a mouthful of nonsense.
Quite frankly, I just kick ass and take names.

01:15:56.440 --> 01:15:59.410
And I'm a part-time inventor.
I kind of suck at it, but...

01:15:59.520 --> 01:16:05.163
I am authorized to confiscate any items
which may present a danger

01:16:05.280 --> 01:16:08.807
to the citizens of the United Nations.

01:16:08.960 --> 01:16:12.567
If you hand Lane over quietly,

01:16:12.680 --> 01:16:17.163
I will confiscate these items peacefully.

01:16:18.440 --> 01:16:21.250
And if not? Then what?

01:16:21.360 --> 01:16:23.806
Burn the place to the ground?
Which executive order is that?

01:16:23.920 --> 01:16:27.242
Be ready. Shoot first if they move.

01:16:28.680 --> 01:16:31.286
I should've killed you
when I had the chance.

01:16:31.440 --> 01:16:34.967
You did have the chance,
but you didn't take it. You failed.

01:16:35.680 --> 01:16:37.967
Not this time.

01:16:43.960 --> 01:16:45.883
Is that the American?

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:47.411
Affirmative.

01:16:47.520 --> 01:16:50.126
He makes one wrong move,
I'm gonna kill him.

01:16:56.680 --> 01:16:59.411
You had what it takes, Lane.

01:16:59.520 --> 01:17:01.761
You could've been a good soldier.

01:17:01.880 --> 01:17:04.645
Instead, you turned into a coward.

01:17:05.480 --> 01:17:07.608
I am a good soldier.

01:17:07.720 --> 01:17:10.610
You're the coward and a traitor.

01:17:12.040 --> 01:17:13.724
Bring him to me!

01:17:20.200 --> 01:17:22.601
- Timmes!
- Sorry. Ah!

01:17:24.240 --> 01:17:28.802
You know that I will not hesitate
to paint this fence with body parts.

01:17:29.480 --> 01:17:31.403
He cried like a baby,

01:17:31.520 --> 01:17:33.045
he sang like a bird,

01:17:33.160 --> 01:17:36.687
and he brought me right to you.

01:17:36.800 --> 01:17:39.121
You now have five seconds.

01:17:39.240 --> 01:17:41.561
- Let him go.
- Five...

01:17:41.680 --> 01:17:44.206
four... three...

01:17:44.320 --> 01:17:46.749
- Don't, Lieutenant!
- ...two...

01:17:53.920 --> 01:17:55.331
Brandon!

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:58.206
What was that?

01:18:04.280 --> 01:18:05.964
I'm tired of these Texans.

01:18:06.080 --> 01:18:07.764
Crash the gates!

01:18:13.120 --> 01:18:16.249
They're mobilizing. Hold your ground.

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.446
Man the .50 cal. I want them dead!

01:19:20.840 --> 01:19:22.888
Good, keep firing that gun!

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:24.889
Bring them down! Kill them!

01:19:40.740 --> 01:19:42.629
Kelly!

01:19:47.640 --> 01:19:49.369
Dammit!

01:19:49.720 --> 01:19:52.200
Hon, are you okay?

01:19:53.840 --> 01:19:56.002
Yeah, I'm okay.

01:20:00.960 --> 01:20:04.885
.50 cals down. Now let's show 'em
how we do it in Texas.

01:20:25.480 --> 01:20:27.960
- Hey, you almost hit me!
- Sorry.

01:20:28.080 --> 01:20:31.801
Just keep firing that thing!
Now let's kick some ass.

01:21:13.360 --> 01:21:16.807
Oh, crap. You gotta be kidding me.

01:21:23.640 --> 01:21:25.768
Cover me, guys.

01:21:38.480 --> 01:21:41.484
Lane! Go get him, go!

01:21:45.440 --> 01:21:48.844
I've got to find Frankie.
I'm gonna check the inner garden.

01:21:48.960 --> 01:21:50.689
Kelly, no, please.

01:21:50.840 --> 01:21:53.127
I'm gonna find my daughter.

01:21:57.600 --> 01:22:00.410
Y'all got me? I'm in spider hole four.

01:22:00.560 --> 01:22:03.803
It's me they want. Let 'em come get me.

01:22:19.480 --> 01:22:21.369
Stay low, Frankie.

01:22:40.160 --> 01:22:42.164
Goodbye, little girl. You're dead.

01:23:06.560 --> 01:23:09.245
Here, land that thing!

01:23:11.560 --> 01:23:13.927
Gus.

01:23:14.040 --> 01:23:15.963
I had no choice.

01:23:16.080 --> 01:23:17.809
I had no choice.

01:23:17.920 --> 01:23:19.490
Oh, Frankie.

01:23:21.760 --> 01:23:23.489
I had no choice.

01:23:23.640 --> 01:23:26.041
Baby, baby, baby, baby.

01:23:26.160 --> 01:23:27.571
Oh, honey.

01:23:27.680 --> 01:23:29.967
- I had no choice.
- Oh, baby.

01:23:30.080 --> 01:23:32.208
Shh...

01:23:32.360 --> 01:23:33.930
Shh.

01:23:56.960 --> 01:23:59.361
- Get this thing in the air.
- Yes, sir.

01:24:04.040 --> 01:24:05.644
Get the chopper.

01:24:08.120 --> 01:24:11.647
Go! Get this thing in the air now!

01:24:36.600 --> 01:24:40.161
- You got this?
- Let's see what this thing can do.

01:24:46.400 --> 01:24:48.448
There he is.

01:25:14.640 --> 01:25:15.880
Catch him!

01:25:33.800 --> 01:25:35.723
We gotta stay out of missile lock.

01:25:41.240 --> 01:25:43.242
They're on your six.

01:25:48.360 --> 01:25:50.124
Fire that missile!

01:26:10.080 --> 01:26:11.411
Going left side.

01:26:15.120 --> 01:26:17.122
Shit!

01:26:20.600 --> 01:26:22.443
All right, I got eyes on 'em.

01:26:32.080 --> 01:26:34.890
- Shoot that thing out of the air.
- I can't manoeuvre like that.

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:41.970
- Ah, sh...
- That's all we got.

01:26:42.080 --> 01:26:43.491
Make it count.

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:51.207
All right, get me in position.

01:26:56.360 --> 01:26:58.283
Here we are, bank right, bank right.

01:27:00.280 --> 01:27:02.806
He's coming over the top!

01:27:04.120 --> 01:27:05.724
Ah!

01:27:07.800 --> 01:27:09.325
Direct hit.

01:27:09.440 --> 01:27:11.329
Good shot, son.

01:27:22.640 --> 01:27:24.802
Looks like we won the battle.

01:27:24.920 --> 01:27:27.571
But the war has just begun.

01:27:33.400 --> 01:27:34.970
Our story...

01:27:35.080 --> 01:27:38.243
may never be recorded
in the annals of history.

01:27:39.040 --> 01:27:40.724
And our history...

01:27:40.840 --> 01:27:43.127
is now nothing but fond memories

01:27:43.240 --> 01:27:45.481
of a once-great nation,

01:27:45.600 --> 01:27:49.366
a nation founded by a legion of patriots

01:27:49.480 --> 01:27:52.051
with a scroll of simple principles.

01:27:52.200 --> 01:27:54.680
A nation bought and paid for by heroes

01:27:54.800 --> 01:27:56.802
that were willing to die for her.

01:27:57.720 --> 01:28:00.724
We are not willing to die
for a puppet government

01:28:00.840 --> 01:28:02.968
run by demonic elite.

01:28:03.440 --> 01:28:05.442
Jefferson was right.

01:28:05.800 --> 01:28:09.521
"The tree of liberty must be
refreshed from time to time

01:28:09.680 --> 01:28:13.082
by the blood of tyrants and patriots."

01:28:14.360 --> 01:28:16.647
It may not have been our choice,

01:28:16.760 --> 01:28:19.650
but we are the new patriots.
