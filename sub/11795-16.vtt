 ( bell rings )

00:03.670 --> 00:07.007
<i>* When I wake up in the</i>
<i>morning and the alarm</i>
<i>gives out a warning</i>

00:07.040 --> 00:09.943
<i>* I don't think</i>
<i>I'll ever make it on time</i>

00:09.976 --> 00:12.946
 <i>* By the time I grab my books</i>
 <i>and I give myself a look</i>

00:12.979 --> 00:16.549
  <i>* I'm at the corner</i>

00:16.583 --> 00:22.088

00:22.122 --> 00:24.991

00:25.025 --> 00:28.028

00:28.061 --> 00:30.964

<i>* It's all right</i>
<i>'Cause I'm saved by the bell *</i>

01:17.477 --> 01:21.414
 I had a wonderful time, Zack.
 That movie really got to me.

01:21.448 --> 01:25.552
  You're the only one who cried
  when Ernest went to jail.

01:25.585 --> 01:28.655
 I wasn't the only one,
 Vern was crying, too.

01:28.688 --> 01:31.257
Well, good night, Zack.

01:31.291 --> 01:35.128
  Kelly,
  I've never felt this way
  about a girl before, and...

01:35.161 --> 01:36.963
 Yes?

01:38.765 --> 01:41.301
 Would you go steady with me?

01:41.334 --> 01:44.471
 Wow! I don't know what to say.

01:44.504 --> 01:47.741
 Boy: Say "good night!"
 It's past her curfew.

01:49.442 --> 01:51.678
   Shouldn't your cute
   little brother be in bed?

01:51.711 --> 01:54.114
He's just trying to protect
his big sister.

01:54.114 --> 01:57.117
  I'm gonna tell Dad!

01:57.150 --> 01:59.719
   Hey, Kyle,
   wanna live till tomorrow?

01:59.753 --> 02:02.055
So, what's your answer?

02:02.055 --> 02:04.524
  Going together
  is a big decision.

02:04.557 --> 02:07.961
  Let me sleep on it, okay?
  'Night!

02:08.061 --> 02:10.130
  Kelly! No good night kiss?!

02:10.163 --> 02:13.066
   Kyle: Take a hike, dork!

02:22.342 --> 02:24.077
 Screech, what are you doing?

02:24.110 --> 02:26.079
   Cramming!
   We've got school
   physicals today,

02:26.079 --> 02:28.081
 and this year
 I don't want to come in last.

02:32.686 --> 02:36.322
   Some people get strange when
   it's time to see
   "Nurse Butcher."

02:36.356 --> 02:38.358
 Not me, I'm in perfect health!

02:38.391 --> 02:41.428
 I eat properly,
 exercise daily,
 get the right amount of rest.

02:41.461 --> 02:44.464
  You sound like
  a commercial for oat bran.

02:45.398 --> 02:47.400
  What's your problem, Bubba?

02:47.434 --> 02:50.403
Look, I don't like
school physicals, okay?

02:50.437 --> 02:53.006
Why? What's so bad
about school physicals?

02:53.106 --> 02:56.376
  Well, I hate to miss class!

02:56.409 --> 03:00.046
 You don't need a physical,
 you need a mental.

03:00.046 --> 03:01.948
  Zack:
  Morning, everybody!

03:02.048 --> 03:04.317
 Screech: Eleven... Twelve...

03:04.351 --> 03:05.919
  Zack:
  How are you doing, Screech?

03:05.952 --> 03:07.654
   What are you so happy about,
   Preppie?

03:07.687 --> 03:10.290
 Oh, nothing.
 Just that I expect to be going

03:10.323 --> 03:13.059
   with the most beautiful girl
   in school by
   the end of the day.

03:13.059 --> 03:15.362
- Have you asked Kelly yet?
- Yes, I did.

03:15.395 --> 03:19.699
  If your head swells any more,
  they're gonna
  have to drain it.

03:19.733 --> 03:22.936
  This is so hot!
  I have to spread
  it all over school.

03:22.969 --> 03:25.071
 Don't forget to use a shovel.

03:25.071 --> 03:28.575
- ( bell rings )
- Time to jump!

03:37.350 --> 03:40.086
  Excuse me.

03:45.492 --> 03:48.094
Could you direct me
to the nurse's office?

03:48.094 --> 03:49.329
  ( mouths silently )

03:50.397 --> 03:52.532
   That way!

03:52.565 --> 03:55.135
   I'll see a sign.

03:55.168 --> 03:57.704
 Thank you.
 You're cute.

03:57.737 --> 03:59.739
 Really cute.

03:59.773 --> 04:01.741
You're welcome!

04:01.775 --> 04:06.579
   - Well, you can talk.
   - Well, ture I can shalk.

04:06.613 --> 04:09.382
   I mean, sure I can talk.
   Are you new here?

04:09.416 --> 04:12.318
  It's my first day.
  I'm Jennifer, and I'm late.

04:12.352 --> 04:14.621
   I'm Zack,

04:14.654 --> 04:16.956
   and I'm in love.

04:25.965 --> 04:27.467
 Good morning, class.

04:27.500 --> 04:29.536
 Good morning,
 Miss Simpson.

04:31.104 --> 04:33.673
 In my day,
 a class would respond

04:33.707 --> 04:36.242
   when a teacher
   wished them good morning.

04:37.977 --> 04:40.080
All right, let's begin.

04:40.080 --> 04:42.382
   You were all supposed
   to write a poem.

04:42.415 --> 04:46.252
   Now, who would like
   to recite first?

04:46.286 --> 04:48.988
 I would,
 Miss Simpson.

04:49.089 --> 04:52.492
 Well then,
 since there are no volunteers,

04:52.525 --> 04:55.161
I shall select someone.

04:55.195 --> 04:59.532
   Mr. Screech,
   will you honor us
   with your verse?

05:01.568 --> 05:04.337
 This is called,
 "When Morning Comes."

05:04.371 --> 05:06.039
 "When morning
 comes I raise my..."

05:06.039 --> 05:08.041
   You may begin when ready.

05:10.377 --> 05:12.278
"When morning comes
I raise my head

05:12.312 --> 05:14.280
  Shut off the alarm
  and get out of bed

05:14.314 --> 05:16.182
   I brush my teeth
   like mother said

05:16.216 --> 05:18.618
 and always feed my spider Ted"

05:20.487 --> 05:23.056
Thrilling, Mr. Screech.

05:23.056 --> 05:26.059
 I wanted to get
 my lizard Oscar in,
 but I couldn't find a rhyme.

05:26.092 --> 05:28.962
The time?
Oh, it's 9:30.

05:29.963 --> 05:31.965
Now, who will be next?

05:32.065 --> 05:34.067
 Miss Turtle?

05:38.505 --> 05:40.507
  "Ode to the Mall."

05:40.540 --> 05:43.543
   "So many stores
   all in one place

05:43.576 --> 05:46.079
It brings a big smile
to my face..."

05:46.112 --> 05:48.715
  Zack, let's talk after class,
  I have an answer for you.

05:50.316 --> 05:52.352
   "I love to hop
   from shop to shop

05:52.385 --> 05:54.954
 And buy and buy
 until I drop"

05:54.988 --> 05:56.690
 Lovely, Miss Turtle.

05:56.723 --> 05:59.459
I like the Rocky Mountains,
too.

06:01.661 --> 06:03.663
    PA: <i>Good morning, students,</i>
   <i>this is your principal,</i>

06:03.697 --> 06:05.932
 <i>and fearless leader</i>
 <i>Mr. Belding.</i>

06:06.032 --> 06:08.101
( class sighs )

06:08.134 --> 06:09.669
  Thank you.

06:09.703 --> 06:12.672
  This week will be your annual
  physicals and flu shots.

06:12.706 --> 06:17.043
   Now to calm any
   fears you may have
   about taking these shots,

06:17.043 --> 06:20.246
 I'm going to take one myself
 to demonstrate to all of you

06:20.280 --> 06:22.282
   that they are
   totally painless.

06:22.315 --> 06:24.517
 Nurse Butcher, if you please.

06:27.053 --> 06:29.155
  ( screams )

06:32.058 --> 06:36.062
 Well, personally,
 I like the old
 school cheer better.

06:36.062 --> 06:41.067
 Miss Kapowski,
 would you take us
 back to the world of poetry?

06:45.572 --> 06:48.074
My poem is called
"That Special Someone."

06:48.074 --> 06:50.643
 "Those eyes so warm,
 that smile so bright

06:50.677 --> 06:53.380
   I think about him
   day and night..."

06:55.382 --> 06:57.384
 "The cutest guy
 I'll ever see

06:57.417 --> 07:00.620
  Oh, lucky, lucky,
  lucky me!"

07:05.225 --> 07:07.494
  <i>This is Mr. Belding again.</i>

07:07.527 --> 07:09.629
  ( groans )

07:09.662 --> 07:13.400
<i>Will, Jessie Spano,</i>
<i>Larry Pilsskin,</i>
<i>and Zack Morris</i>

07:13.433 --> 07:16.036
<i>please report</i>
<i>to the nurse's office?</i>

07:18.238 --> 07:20.206
  Oh, people, please.

07:20.240 --> 07:24.044
   Miss Kapowski's poem
   wasn't that bad.

07:25.945 --> 07:29.449
   D-E-F-P-O-T-E-C.

07:29.482 --> 07:33.086
   I'm sorry, young lady,
   I think you need glasses.

07:33.119 --> 07:34.621
   Glasses?!

07:34.654 --> 07:37.524
Do you want me to look like
a four-eyed frog face?

07:37.557 --> 07:40.193
  - Ribbit.
 <i>-</i> PA: <i>Nurse Butcher!</i>

07:40.226 --> 07:43.630
 <i>Report to my</i>
 <i>office immediately!</i>
 <i>My arm is throbbing.</i>

07:43.663 --> 07:46.499
 What a wimp!

07:56.076 --> 07:58.178
  So, Jessie, how did it go?

07:58.211 --> 08:00.613
 Zack, do you think guys
 like girls who wear glasses?

08:00.647 --> 08:04.417
- No way!
- Well, who asked you?

08:09.456 --> 08:11.091
 Zack Morris?

08:12.492 --> 08:16.029
   - I remember you.
   - You're a nurse?

08:16.029 --> 08:18.031
   Yes, I'll be taking over
   for Nurse Butcher

08:18.064 --> 08:19.432
 when she retires next month.

08:19.466 --> 08:22.035
  I'm assisting her
  with the physicals.

08:22.068 --> 08:24.404
  Zack,
  are you feeling all right?

08:24.437 --> 08:28.041
   Suddenly, I'm very weak.

08:28.041 --> 08:31.044
  Your pulse is racing.
  Would you like to sit down?

08:31.044 --> 08:34.047
 Oh, no!
 I prefer being held.

08:34.080 --> 08:36.383
  I know, you're worried
  about the needles.

08:36.416 --> 08:39.152
  Don't worry,
  nobody likes shots.

08:39.184 --> 08:41.254
  Trust me,
  when this is all over with,

08:41.287 --> 08:43.289
   you are going to
   feel much better.

08:43.323 --> 08:47.060
But if you don't,
you stop by and see
me anytime, all right?

08:47.060 --> 08:49.329
- Really?
- Sure.

08:49.362 --> 08:52.132
   How's that feel?

08:52.165 --> 08:55.402
  Wonderful!
  Please do it again.

08:58.672 --> 09:01.574
  I don't know why
  Zack's physical
  is taking so long?

09:01.608 --> 09:04.577
 Kelly! I know he asked you
 to go with him.

09:04.611 --> 09:06.413
  Is the answer yes?

09:06.446 --> 09:09.249
  Well,
  you can't tell Zack, but...

09:09.282 --> 09:11.918
Oh, my!
What a moment!

09:12.018 --> 09:13.653
What a thrill!

09:13.687 --> 09:17.023
  First the Berlin Wall comes
  down, then the Brady
  Bunch comes back,

09:17.023 --> 09:19.492
   and now Zack and Kelly
   are going steady!

09:19.526 --> 09:22.028
   Oh, boy, oh, boy,
   oh, boy!

09:22.028 --> 09:25.498
 Only in America!
 Zack!

09:25.532 --> 09:29.035
   This is the happiest
   moment of my life!
   Congratulations!

09:29.035 --> 09:31.171
 You weren't
 supposed to tell him.

09:31.204 --> 09:33.473
  ( hisses )

09:36.042 --> 09:38.578
   Well,
   I guess you know the answer.
   It's yes.

09:38.611 --> 09:42.182
   That's great, Kel.
   So what was the question?

09:49.422 --> 09:51.791
 Oh, come on, it's no big deal.

09:51.825 --> 09:53.693
One of you just write,

09:53.727 --> 09:55.862
   "Our family doctor
   has already given
   AC his flu shot.

09:55.895 --> 09:58.531
 Thanks anyway,
 Mrs. Loretta Slater."

09:58.565 --> 10:00.867
 Slater, that's not only lying,
 that's forgery.

10:00.900 --> 10:03.737
  The captain of
  the wrestling team
  afraid of a little needle?

10:03.770 --> 10:05.739
   Don't mention that word.

10:05.772 --> 10:09.009
 I can't even
 watch my mother knit.

10:09.042 --> 10:12.579
 Slater, I've got real problems
 to worry about, okay?
 My eyes are bad.

10:12.612 --> 10:14.914
Yeah, well the rest of you
makes up for it, Mama.

10:16.750 --> 10:19.586
   Lisa, Jessie,
   I need to talk
   to you both, now!

10:19.619 --> 10:23.823
  - Girl talk, Slater.
  Pardon us.
  - Okay, but first,

10:23.857 --> 10:26.359
 Kelly, I've always admired
 your handwriting.

10:26.393 --> 10:29.362
  - I was
  wondering if you could...
  - Move it!

10:29.396 --> 10:31.598
  I love it when
  you treat me rough.

10:33.600 --> 10:35.402
  What's the problem, Kelly?

10:35.435 --> 10:37.804
  I don't think Zack wants
  to go out with me anymore.

10:37.837 --> 10:40.040
Is it possible that
he likes someone else?

10:40.073 --> 10:42.509
  Kelly, get real. He's been
  in love with you for years.

10:42.542 --> 10:44.077
  There's got to
  be another reason.

10:45.879 --> 10:47.914
 If it'll make you feel better,
 I'll talk to him.

10:47.947 --> 10:49.649
 Oh, that'd be great, Jessie.

10:49.683 --> 10:51.751
   But first,
   I need an honest answer.

10:51.785 --> 10:54.354
 How do I look in these frames?

10:54.387 --> 10:57.524
 Ridiculous. You're lucky
 you don't have to wear them.

10:57.557 --> 11:00.326
   - I don't think
   they're that bad.
   - Thanks, Kelly!

11:00.360 --> 11:02.696
  Hey, nice glasses, Jessie.

11:02.729 --> 11:04.531
 Oh, do you really like them?

11:04.564 --> 11:06.866
   Yeah,
   all my grandmother's friends
   wear the same kind.

11:09.536 --> 11:12.405
 Hi, Jennifer.

11:12.439 --> 11:15.275
Hello there, Jennifer.

11:16.710 --> 11:19.479
 Yo! Jen babe.

11:19.512 --> 11:21.681
 Zack? Can I come in?

11:21.715 --> 11:24.384
   Yeah, Jessie!
   What are you doing here?

11:24.417 --> 11:26.419
 Look, Kelly is really upset.

11:26.453 --> 11:29.856
 You asked her to
 go steady, and now
 you're backing off. What's up?

11:29.889 --> 11:31.891
   Look,
   Jessie, I can't tell you.

11:31.925 --> 11:34.928
Zack, we've been friends
since the first grade.

11:34.961 --> 11:36.930
   You can trust me.

11:36.963 --> 11:40.700
 All right, do you promise
 not to tell any of the guys?

11:40.734 --> 11:43.636
  I promise. Tell me.

11:43.670 --> 11:46.706
 I'm in love with
 the new school nurse.

11:46.740 --> 11:49.642
   You pig!

11:49.676 --> 11:51.678
   How is Kelly gonna feel
   when you dump her

11:51.711 --> 11:53.513
   - for some flu shot floozie?
   - Hold on!

11:53.546 --> 11:54.948
  I didn't say I
  wanted to dump her.

11:54.981 --> 11:56.916
 Look, Kelly's a great girl...

11:56.950 --> 11:59.819
In a young kind of way.

11:59.853 --> 12:02.088
 What are you going to do?
 Go out with her and the nurse?

12:03.056 --> 12:05.358
That's not a bad idea.

12:06.526 --> 12:09.462
   ( moans )

12:09.496 --> 12:10.663
  Have no fear, dying person.

12:10.697 --> 12:13.933
Dr. Zachary Morris,
the world famous
surgeon is on his way.

12:13.967 --> 12:17.070
  ( moans again )
  Okay, let's boogie!

12:17.070 --> 12:19.072
 Nurse Jennifer,
 Nurse Kelly,

12:19.072 --> 12:23.343
  - prepare me for surgery.
  -Yes, Dr. Morris.

12:23.376 --> 12:25.879
   Doctor, please!
   I hurt all over.

12:25.912 --> 12:27.914
 Anesthetic,
 Dr. Screech.

12:27.947 --> 12:30.850
Right away, Dr. Morris.

12:30.884 --> 12:31.918
  Thank you.

12:34.554 --> 12:36.890
  Kelly's gonna be really upset
  when she hears about this.

12:36.923 --> 12:38.291
 But she is not
 gonna hear about it,

12:38.324 --> 12:39.993
 because you
 promised not to tell.

12:40.093 --> 12:42.429
 Now, what do you think
 of this tie?

12:42.462 --> 12:44.597
 I think it should be tighter!

12:53.106 --> 12:55.909
 Oh, Jessie,
 did you see Zack this morning?

12:55.942 --> 12:59.112
  - Yes.
  - Well,
  how does he feel about me?

12:59.112 --> 13:01.348
  When I left he
  was all choked up.

13:01.381 --> 13:04.951
  Really? Then maybe
  we're going
  together after all!

13:05.051 --> 13:07.287
That's wonderful,
Miss Kapowski!

13:07.320 --> 13:11.358
 Two students from my class
 going steady.

13:11.391 --> 13:13.426
 Miss Simpson,
 you heard us?

13:13.460 --> 13:15.895
  Yes, I'm wearing
  a new hearing aid.

13:15.929 --> 13:18.965
It's a brand new model,
very sensitive.

13:19.065 --> 13:22.068
( bell rings, screams )

13:25.805 --> 13:28.074
  Miss Simpson,
  I'm not feeling very well.

13:28.074 --> 13:30.276
 May I have your permission
 to go see the nurse?

13:30.310 --> 13:31.845
  Yes, but you needn't shout!

13:31.878 --> 13:33.680
  Zack, I'll walk you there.

13:33.713 --> 13:35.849
 - Oh, no!
 - ( screams )

13:35.882 --> 13:38.418
   Oh, that's okay, Kelly.

13:38.451 --> 13:39.719
   I should go to
   the nurse alone.

13:39.753 --> 13:41.087
 You wouldn't want to see this.

13:41.087 --> 13:43.490
You can say that again.

13:45.358 --> 13:49.095
 Now, let us continue our study
 of the romantic poets,

13:49.095 --> 13:53.833
  and turn our attention to
  the gentle words
  of Percy Shelley.

13:53.867 --> 13:56.770
 - Miss Simpson!
 - ( screams )

13:56.803 --> 13:59.706
   I've had it with
   this hearing aid!

13:59.739 --> 14:03.443
  - Is something wrong?
  - What did you say?

14:03.476 --> 14:06.913
   Never mind.
   Slater,
   report for your physical.

14:12.052 --> 14:15.055
 ( class humming
<i>Funeral March )</i>

14:17.557 --> 14:19.526
  Very funny.

14:26.666 --> 14:29.069
  Hi there, Jennifer.

14:29.069 --> 14:33.073
 Well, hello.
 You look nice all dressed up!

14:33.073 --> 14:36.676
 Oh, thanks for noticing, Jen.

14:36.710 --> 14:38.712
  So, what can I do for you?

14:38.745 --> 14:41.514
Oh boy,
now there's a question.

14:41.548 --> 14:44.918
I mean,
my head is feeling hot.

14:44.951 --> 14:47.520
   Hm-mm. Feels cool to me.

14:47.554 --> 14:50.557
 Well, that's what I meant.
 I'm freezing.

14:50.590 --> 14:53.660
This is a very strange
reaction to a flu shot.

14:53.693 --> 14:56.329
I wonder what's going on
in that body of yours?

14:57.731 --> 14:59.399
 Whoa!

15:00.900 --> 15:02.936
Jennifer, there's something
I have to tell you.

15:03.036 --> 15:05.038
   Maybe I should take
   your temperature.

15:05.038 --> 15:07.674
 I left my
 thermometer in the other room,
 I'll be right back.

15:07.707 --> 15:09.275
Relax!

15:21.888 --> 15:24.657
 Jennifer?
 Is that you?

15:28.795 --> 15:32.499
( high voice )
Mm-hmm.

15:32.532 --> 15:34.534
  Aren't you coming back in?

15:34.567 --> 15:36.269
Huh-uh.

15:37.070 --> 15:39.072
  Oh, Jennifer, don't be shy.

15:39.072 --> 15:41.307
I never believed
in love at first sight,

15:41.341 --> 15:43.576
  until l saw you yesterday
  in the hall.

15:43.610 --> 15:45.578
 Look, this is the real thing.

15:45.612 --> 15:47.814
Don't fight it.
Just go with the flow.

15:47.847 --> 15:49.449
  ( giggles )

15:49.482 --> 15:51.818
 Yes, my darling,
 we were meant to be together.

15:51.851 --> 15:54.821
   Be mine!

15:54.854 --> 15:58.858
- Where's Jennifer?
- Who cares? I'm yours!

15:58.892 --> 16:00.427
 Slater, how much did you hear?

16:00.460 --> 16:03.229
Just enough to destroy
you with Kelly forever.

16:03.263 --> 16:05.331
  - You wouldn't.
  - I would!

16:05.365 --> 16:08.268
 But I could also keep it
 between you,
 me, and the curtain,

16:08.301 --> 16:11.037
   if you do a little
   something for me.

16:11.037 --> 16:13.707
   How do you feel about
   taking another flu shot?

16:13.740 --> 16:15.775
  All right,

16:15.809 --> 16:19.579
 which one of you is AC Slater?

16:21.514 --> 16:22.615
   ( sighs )

16:22.649 --> 16:24.884
 I am.

16:24.918 --> 16:27.053
  Bend over, Blondie.

16:35.195 --> 16:36.863
What did you want
to see me about, Zack?

16:36.896 --> 16:38.798
Screech, would you sit down
so I can talk to you?

16:38.832 --> 16:41.568
  Can't, Zack, I'm in training.
  Physical's today.

16:41.601 --> 16:43.570
   It's about Kelly and me.

16:43.603 --> 16:45.605
   Lovely couple!
   Only in America.

16:45.638 --> 16:47.974
   No, I don't want
   to go out with
   her exclusively.

16:48.074 --> 16:50.844
   Look,
   I wanna date other girls.

16:50.877 --> 16:52.345
What about the wedding?

16:52.379 --> 16:55.115
I bought you a blender.

16:55.148 --> 16:57.984
   Screech, just keep the gift,
   I'll be okay.

16:58.084 --> 17:00.820
But Kelly will need someone
to keep her mind
off me for a while.

17:00.854 --> 17:03.023
  Now, do you know someone?
  -How about Slater?

17:03.023 --> 17:05.325
  Oh, no, no, no.
  We need someone...

17:05.358 --> 17:08.261
   Someone more sensitive,
   someone like you.

17:08.294 --> 17:11.031
Well, there is this new kid
named Melvin Nerdly.

17:11.031 --> 17:13.700
  Nerdly? I love him already.

17:13.733 --> 17:15.568
  Yeah, he is a substitute
  on our chess team.

17:15.602 --> 17:18.805
 - Great, what's he like?
 - He's not as cool as I am...

17:18.838 --> 17:22.108
   - He's kind of a geek.
   - That's perfect!

17:22.142 --> 17:24.144
 I'll go and talk
 to Melvin right now.

17:24.176 --> 17:26.246
 Hi, Screech!

17:26.279 --> 17:29.582
   ( Screech cries )

17:29.616 --> 17:32.052
 All right, Zack,
 I thought you
 wanted to go steady?

17:32.085 --> 17:34.254
   What's going on?

17:34.287 --> 17:36.856
  Kelly, there's something
  I have to tell you.

17:36.890 --> 17:39.592
 I think we should date
 other people.

17:39.626 --> 17:41.261
 Date other people? What for?

17:41.294 --> 17:43.296
I adore your innocence,

17:43.329 --> 17:47.334
  but Kelly,
  think of a nut
  on a forest floor.

17:47.367 --> 17:50.103
   It needs space
   if it's gonna
   grow into a tree,

17:50.136 --> 17:52.739
 and you and I are those nuts.

17:52.772 --> 17:54.808
No, Zack, you're nuts.

17:54.841 --> 17:56.910
   Is there someone else
   you want to go out with?

17:56.943 --> 18:00.246
   Kelly, there's not another
   student in school that
   I'm interested in.

18:00.280 --> 18:01.848
 Are you sure about this, Zack?

18:01.881 --> 18:04.084
  Just trust me.
  It's for the best.

18:10.323 --> 18:12.225
  Hey, Kelly.

18:13.259 --> 18:14.828
 What's wrong, Kelly?

18:14.861 --> 18:17.597
Men!
Especially Zack Morris!

18:17.630 --> 18:21.034
Hey, don't judge us
by our worst specimen.

18:23.903 --> 18:25.572
   What did Zack do to her?

18:25.605 --> 18:27.707
   I wish I could tell you.

18:27.741 --> 18:29.743
 Do you know what's going on?

18:29.776 --> 18:32.712
  No, no.
  I just meant I wish I did.

18:32.746 --> 18:34.581
Jessie, you might not
be the only one

18:34.614 --> 18:36.616
 who wishes they could tell
 what they knew.

18:36.649 --> 18:38.752
 I mean, if they really knew,

18:38.785 --> 18:40.820
  which they have
  to say they don't.

18:40.854 --> 18:42.122
 You mean there's someone else,

18:42.155 --> 18:44.557
say a Mr. S
who knows about a Mr. Z?

18:44.591 --> 18:48.628
 Yes, but Mr. S made a promise
 to Mr. Z not to tell anyone.

18:48.661 --> 18:50.697
 Miss J made the same promise.

18:50.730 --> 18:52.732
Does Miss J know
about the new N

18:52.766 --> 18:54.768
 who's causing
 all the problems for Miss K?

18:54.801 --> 18:57.070
  Miss J knows all about it.

18:57.070 --> 18:59.072
  Well, then,
  why don't you
  tell the new nurse,

18:59.072 --> 19:01.007
   what Zack did to Kelly?
   I'm sure she can
   take care of it.

19:01.007 --> 19:03.276
 Lisa, we promised not to tell.

19:03.309 --> 19:07.147
  Well, Miss L here didn't,
  and she's telling.

19:08.715 --> 19:11.751
  And we're watching.

19:11.785 --> 19:15.021
 I can't believe he would treat
 his girlfriend this way!

19:15.021 --> 19:17.524
   Well,
   now that I've seen you...

19:17.557 --> 19:20.060
  I mean, he's swine.

19:22.262 --> 19:24.264
 Well,
 just leave everything to me.

19:24.297 --> 19:27.200
  I've had plenty of experience
  dealing with sick people.

19:27.233 --> 19:29.202
Thanks a lot, Jennifer.

19:29.235 --> 19:31.237
   I don't understand how
   I could've gotten
   all these wrong?

19:31.271 --> 19:33.673
   They look so clear to me.

19:33.707 --> 19:37.744
   D-E-F-P-O-T-E-C.

19:37.777 --> 19:41.314
 Jessie, you got them
 all right. Who told you
 you needed glasses?

19:41.348 --> 19:44.684
   - Nurse Butcher!
   - "Blind as bat" Butcher?

19:44.718 --> 19:47.120
  She can hardly see,
  that's why she's retiring.

19:47.153 --> 19:52.058
This morning,
she gave a flu
shot to the flag pole.

19:52.092 --> 19:54.260
 Maybe you can find someone
 who needs these.

19:55.662 --> 19:57.664
 Let's get "lover boy" in here,

19:57.697 --> 19:59.666
 and let him see a side of me

19:59.699 --> 20:01.935
he's never seen before.

20:05.972 --> 20:08.608
Oh, Jennifer. I'm back.

20:10.176 --> 20:13.813
  - You wanted to see me?
  - I certainly did.

20:17.217 --> 20:20.320
  It's rather warm in here,
  don't you think?

20:22.122 --> 20:24.224
   ( sighs )

20:26.059 --> 20:28.895
  That's much better.

20:28.928 --> 20:33.233
  Zack, I haven't been able
  to stop thinking about you.

20:33.833 --> 20:35.702
Really?

20:35.735 --> 20:38.605
 You like me, don't you, Zack?

20:38.638 --> 20:40.674
   Oh, yeah!

20:40.707 --> 20:43.109
 You're sweet.

20:43.143 --> 20:45.311
 Not like my husband.

20:45.345 --> 20:47.347
Your husband?!

20:47.380 --> 20:50.316
 Yes,
 he's a professional wrestler.

20:50.350 --> 20:52.352
   Hulk Hogan says
   he could be the champion,

20:52.385 --> 20:55.622
 except for his violent temper.

20:55.655 --> 20:57.657
   Violent?!
   Temper?!

20:57.691 --> 20:59.759
 Jennifer,
 maybe I better be leaving now.

20:59.793 --> 21:01.795
You're right,
let's run away tonight!

21:01.828 --> 21:05.165
 Oh, no, I'm sorry.
 I'm not allowed to
 sleep over on school nights.

21:05.198 --> 21:07.901
  Let's get married
  and have lots of children!

21:07.934 --> 21:10.603
   - Oh, I've got a girlfriend!
   - She can sit for us.

21:10.637 --> 21:13.640
 Oh, no, you don't understand,
 one girl is all I can handle.

21:15.241 --> 21:18.678
   Zack, do you want a girl?

21:19.979 --> 21:21.715
  Or a woman?

21:23.083 --> 21:25.352
   I wanna go back to class!

21:41.101 --> 21:43.136
 Zack, what are you doing here?

21:43.169 --> 21:45.171
  What am I doing here?
  I came to see you.

21:45.205 --> 21:48.174
  Well,
  you picked an awkward time.

21:48.208 --> 21:51.644
 Zack, I'd like you to meet
 Melvin Nerdly.

21:52.645 --> 21:54.280
 You're Melvin Nerdly?

21:54.314 --> 21:56.883
   Just call me Mel.

21:56.916 --> 21:58.818
You play chess?

21:58.852 --> 22:01.888
   Yeah, and football,
   and baseball, and hockey.

22:01.921 --> 22:05.392
   I even model a little.
   See you tomorrow, Kelly.

22:08.595 --> 22:11.064
  It was a great idea about
  dating other people, Zack.

22:11.064 --> 22:13.066
Tonight,
Melvin taught me chess,

22:13.066 --> 22:16.569
 tomorrow, he's teaching me
 Lambada. Thanks!

22:16.603 --> 22:19.739
Look, Kelly,
I've been acting
crazy recently,

22:19.773 --> 22:22.242
  but now I'm back to normal.

22:22.275 --> 22:25.912
  I want to go out with you
  and nobody else.

22:25.945 --> 22:28.348
 Zack, I adore your innocence,

22:28.381 --> 22:31.084
when two nuts in the forest
are dating other nuts,

22:31.117 --> 22:34.087
they can't go
steady with each other.
Good night!

22:36.156 --> 22:39.325
  Wait, Kelly.
  Oh, come on, Kelly.

22:39.359 --> 22:41.728
 Kyle:
 Go away, or you'll be sorry.

22:41.761 --> 22:43.329
   Hey, Kyle, just butt out!

22:43.363 --> 22:46.332
 Okay, I warned you...

22:52.372 --> 22:55.108
 ( instrumental music plays )
