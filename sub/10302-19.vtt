01:21.000 --> 01:22.353
Hi, I'm the Verminator.

01:22.600 --> 01:24.591
And guess what I've got for you?

01:24.840 --> 01:26.751
Show can.

01:27.000 --> 01:28.752
Okay.

01:29.920 --> 01:32.878
That's "spray can," you spok es-idiot!

01:33.120 --> 01:34.348
I knew that.

01:34.600 --> 01:39.549
Anyway, we've got a brand new poison
and we lik e to call it...

01:44.000 --> 01:47.436
How new is it? It's so new
that it hasn't even been tested...

01:47.680 --> 01:51.036
...on unsuspecting
American citizens yet.

01:51.720 --> 01:54.518
Just one spray of this,
on your dog or cat...

01:54.760 --> 01:56.671
...and they'll never have fleas again.

01:56.920 --> 02:01.869
And to prove it, I have v olunteered
my dog or cat, Buck...

02:06.080 --> 02:07.832
...to demonstrate.

02:08.080 --> 02:09.433
Are you ready, boy?

02:09.680 --> 02:11.636
Help me.

02:11.880 --> 02:13.871
Here we go.

02:18.120 --> 02:19.872
Isn't this great, Buck?

02:20.120 --> 02:22.315
And you didn't wanna do it.

02:27.040 --> 02:28.758
Yeah, this is great.

02:29.000 --> 02:31.958
I look lik e Oprah
after she dropped the weight.

02:33.920 --> 02:35.592
Hi, Peggy.

02:40.320 --> 02:41.958
Now, I don't want to rub this in...

02:42.200 --> 02:46.159
...because you're poor and married
to Al which is, of course, redundant.

02:46.400 --> 02:48.391
But guess what? I'm rich!

02:48.760 --> 02:51.228
Rich? Well, how'd you do that?

02:51.480 --> 02:53.596
- Maybe I could do it too.
- I worked for it.

02:57.160 --> 02:59.230
You see, Trans-Mexican Motors...

02:59.480 --> 03:04.076
...has been looking for a place
to build their new car, the Haguar GT...

03:04.760 --> 03:08.196
...and I found them a piece of property
right next to Polk High School.

03:08.440 --> 03:13.036
It is a four hundred million-dollar
deal and I get a finder's fee.

03:13.280 --> 03:14.633
How much is that?

03:14.880 --> 03:18.555
One point three million dollars.

03:24.240 --> 03:28.233
Plus a brand new Haguar
for each of us.

03:29.120 --> 03:30.872
Don't think this is going
to change us.

03:31.120 --> 03:35.477
No. We'll still be the same
humble people we always were.

03:35.880 --> 03:38.075
Just in a better part of town.

03:38.320 --> 03:41.357
Oh, yeah. I forgot to tell you.
We're moving!

03:44.360 --> 03:48.114
And we just came by to tell you
how sorry we are about leaving!

03:48.800 --> 03:51.792
Jefferson!
This is the happiest day of my life!

03:52.040 --> 03:53.519
Isn't this a great country?

03:53.760 --> 03:56.149
This country sucks, Peg!

04:05.560 --> 04:06.879
And I'll tell you why.

04:07.120 --> 04:10.829
We're giving it away faster than
we can take it from other people.

04:11.520 --> 04:14.830
I was driving by Polk High today
to catch a glimpse of the scoreboard...

04:15.080 --> 04:19.596
...which once proclaimed my glory and
fight with the homeless for nickels...

04:19.839 --> 04:22.479
...and guess what sign
I saw on the school fence.

04:22.720 --> 04:26.235
"Life, 50, Al, zero"?

04:28.240 --> 04:31.312
Hey, Marcie,
I see they drink a lot at Zippy Cuts.

04:37.200 --> 04:41.273
The sign said
"Future home of the Haguar"...

04:41.520 --> 04:42.953
...which means, Peg...

04:43.160 --> 04:45.958
...they will be building
automobiles on the football field...

04:46.160 --> 04:48.549
...where I scored four touchdowns
in a single game.

04:49.000 --> 04:52.310
Where pert cheerleaders
in stuffed bras and short miniskirts...

04:52.560 --> 04:56.633
...used to sing, " One, two, four, three,
Give the ball to Al Bundy."

04:59.320 --> 05:01.959
This is madness, I say!
How could this have happened?

05:02.200 --> 05:03.952
Two town meetings...

05:04.200 --> 05:08.591
...a suitcase full of unmarked bills
and it's pretty much a done deal.

05:08.840 --> 05:10.637
- You were involved?
- I was.

05:13.320 --> 05:15.390
Well, you're not going
to get away with this.

05:15.640 --> 05:18.473
If it's a war you want,
it's a war you'll get.

05:18.720 --> 05:22.872
But you and your fellow Haguaites
should know one thing:

05:23.120 --> 05:28.990
Al is the first word in "Alamo."

05:34.000 --> 05:37.629
Al, we lost the Alamo.

05:40.240 --> 05:42.959
Peg, nobody remembers that.

05:49.520 --> 05:51.476
Hi. Verminator here again.

05:51.720 --> 05:53.995
Now, a few of you viewers
have expressed concern...

05:54.240 --> 05:57.949
...over alleged side effects
of our new bug poison.

05:58.200 --> 06:02.876
Springtime in Baghdad.
Now with pepsin.

06:04.440 --> 06:07.477
I'm here to tell you that these
allegations of genetic mutations...

06:07.720 --> 06:12.874
...are completely false, and to
prove it, my brother Bud here...

06:22.400 --> 06:23.799
...who I love lik e a brother...

06:24.040 --> 06:26.679
...has graciously v olunteered
to be sprayed directly...

06:26.920 --> 06:29.195
...in the kisser with this stuff.

06:29.760 --> 06:30.988
Are you ready, Bud?

06:31.320 --> 06:33.117
I'll kill you...

06:35.040 --> 06:37.235
See, he can't wait.

06:37.480 --> 06:39.357
Let's do it.

06:45.160 --> 06:47.037
You were great, Bud.

06:47.280 --> 06:51.239
People are gonna recognize you
wherever you go.

07:05.560 --> 07:08.632
Come on, Ma, tell the truth.

07:08.960 --> 07:11.269
You think these'll turn girls off?

07:12.480 --> 07:14.038
Oh, come on, honey.

07:14.280 --> 07:17.909
Don't let a little thing like a
couple of breasts get you down.

07:18.560 --> 07:20.357
It's not like they're permanent.

07:20.600 --> 07:25.037
I mean, it's been a whole week and
look how much better Buck is getting.

07:27.960 --> 07:31.669
I sure hope this crap wears off
before Thanksgiving.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.116
Well, maybe you're right, Ma.

07:35.360 --> 07:37.476
I'll just hide for a while.

07:38.760 --> 07:41.832
It's not like
I had any plans this week.

07:48.480 --> 07:50.072
Hi, Bud.

07:50.320 --> 07:51.878
It's me, Sascha.

07:52.120 --> 07:56.557
The girl you've wanted every day and
night of your life since the first grade.

07:56.800 --> 07:59.155
Well, I'm about to enter a convent...

07:59.400 --> 08:02.039
...and I wanted to be
with a real man...

08:02.280 --> 08:03.679
...for my first...

08:03.920 --> 08:05.148
...last...

08:05.400 --> 08:07.436
...and only time.

08:12.480 --> 08:14.789
Take me, Bud.

08:15.160 --> 08:17.913
Take me now!

08:28.200 --> 08:30.634
You caught me at a bad time.

08:32.679 --> 08:34.238
Goodbye.

08:43.919 --> 08:45.512
Where are you going?

08:45.760 --> 08:48.433
To cop a feel and kill myself.

08:53.200 --> 08:54.428
Hey, Mom.

08:54.680 --> 08:55.954
Bud still have boobs?

08:57.840 --> 09:01.435
Then I'll be sleeping at Cindy's.
Where's Dad?

09:01.680 --> 09:03.557
Oh, he's down
at the City Council meeting.

09:03.800 --> 09:07.110
You know, he's really steamed about
them paving over his football field.

09:07.960 --> 09:11.236
I just hope he doesn't make a testicle
out of himself.

09:15.320 --> 09:16.912
You mean spectacle, honey.

09:17.160 --> 09:20.038
No, I mean testicle.

09:21.360 --> 09:23.430
I'm used to the spectacle thing.

09:23.920 --> 09:28.277
Let's just hope that if he'll make a fool
of himself, he'll do it in his own home.

09:30.120 --> 09:33.157
And on the lighter,
more pitiful side of the news...

09:33.400 --> 09:36.437
...self-proclaimed football legend
Al Bundy is leading a protest...

09:36.680 --> 09:39.069
...against the proposed
trans-Mexican auto plant...

09:39.320 --> 09:44.155
...by handcuffing himself to a goal post
on his old high school playing field.

09:44.400 --> 09:48.518
He has v owed to stay chained
to this post...

09:54.880 --> 10:00.750
...until the project is moved
or, quote, "Marcie has lips."

10:02.200 --> 10:04.395
What a testicle.

10:14.600 --> 10:19.469
Bud, I'm glad you're here
to share my moment of triumph.

10:24.480 --> 10:27.119
You got someone
working crowd control, Dad?

10:27.960 --> 10:29.712
These things take time, son.

10:29.920 --> 10:32.229
You think people came
when Paul Revere rode nude...

10:32.480 --> 10:35.153
...through the town yelling
"The Beatles are coming"? No.

10:35.520 --> 10:39.308
He had to chain himself to the old north
wind and throw up in harbour first.

10:39.560 --> 10:42.757
But like old Paul,
you'll be reading about me someday.

10:43.160 --> 10:46.994
Yeah, once Time-Life comes out
with the "Great Idiot" series.

10:50.840 --> 10:54.230
Anyway, I just came over because Mom
was wondering if you wanted any food.

10:55.040 --> 10:56.268
Did you bring me something?

10:58.240 --> 11:00.595
No. She was just wondering.

11:01.560 --> 11:04.836
Well, you tell your mother
that my stomach is full of pride.

11:05.080 --> 11:09.073
Pride and the bologna sandwich
I ate a couple of weeks ago.

11:09.480 --> 11:12.358
By the way, it's warm out here tonight.
Why the coat?

11:16.360 --> 11:18.510
I was just coming down
with something.

11:18.760 --> 11:20.796
- Chest cold?
- No.

11:22.320 --> 11:25.517
No. This coat
just makes them sensitive.

11:29.440 --> 11:30.714
Anyway, I'm glad you're here.

11:30.960 --> 11:32.837
Help me pass out
the rest of those flyers.

11:33.040 --> 11:35.873
Take them to all the places
old high school athletes hang out.

11:36.120 --> 11:40.113
You mean like bars, unemployment
offices and pie-eating contests?

11:40.360 --> 11:42.749
Yes. And don't forget
freeway underpasses.

11:43.000 --> 11:46.549
Tell them to bring candles
and a cheeseburger.

11:47.120 --> 11:48.348
- Anything else?
- Yes.

11:48.600 --> 11:52.673
Take the keys to the handcuffs out
of my back pocket so I'm not tempted.

11:53.240 --> 11:54.912
Yeah, yeah.

11:57.440 --> 12:00.910
Dad, you sure this protest thing
is gonna work?

12:01.160 --> 12:04.311
Son, I'm not sure
of a lot of things in this life.

12:04.560 --> 12:07.233
I'm not sure why I was born.

12:07.760 --> 12:10.274
I'm not sure why you were born.

12:11.280 --> 12:14.113
I'm also not sure of why I felt
a pair of breasts on my back...

12:14.360 --> 12:16.635
...when you took those keys
out of my pocket.

12:22.240 --> 12:25.198
But I am sure that this will work.

12:25.440 --> 12:29.718
Tonight, fuelled by the flames
of 10,000 candles...

12:29.960 --> 12:31.598
...and several cheeseburgers...

12:31.840 --> 12:34.115
...I will be victorious!

12:49.880 --> 12:51.677
I don't get it.

12:52.440 --> 12:56.319
A great historical landmark
is about to fall and no one turns out.

12:56.560 --> 13:00.951
Let some moron hit an ice skater in the
knee and a million reporters show up!

13:04.560 --> 13:06.312
- Hi, Mr. Bundy.
- Aaron.

13:06.560 --> 13:09.154
I knew I could count on someone
who played for Polk High.

13:09.400 --> 13:12.437
- Well, I saw your flyers.
- Good. Then Bud is doing his job.

13:12.680 --> 13:16.719
He is, if you told him to stuff them
in a trash can about a block from here.

13:17.000 --> 13:18.718
All the guys are talking about it.

13:18.960 --> 13:20.393
Great. What are they saying?

13:20.640 --> 13:24.349
They hear Haguar pays $15.40 an hour
plus medical. They're really psyched.

13:25.240 --> 13:27.993
Doesn't anybody care
about preserving our heritage?

13:28.240 --> 13:32.313
Well, I thought selling out
to the highest bidder was our heritage.

13:32.920 --> 13:36.549
Not when it's our field!
Why is no one here?

13:36.800 --> 13:39.519
Wait a second.
I know what the problem is.

13:39.760 --> 13:43.833
I just realized, I chained myself
to the visitors end of the field.

13:44.080 --> 13:46.594
No one would ever recognize me
down here.

13:46.840 --> 13:48.751
Don't they change sides
after halftime?

13:49.000 --> 13:51.912
I never played after halftime!

13:52.160 --> 13:54.799
We were always too far ahead.

13:55.040 --> 13:58.430
Now, go get Bud and bring the keys
back here. I wanna switch goal posts.

13:58.680 --> 13:59.999
He gave the key to me.

14:00.200 --> 14:02.350
- Good. Give it here.
- Can't. I gave it to Kelly.

14:02.600 --> 14:03.715
Why?

14:04.640 --> 14:07.438
It was bright and shiny
and she liked it.

14:09.160 --> 14:11.469
Go get her, bring her back here,
and hurry.

14:11.720 --> 14:14.188
I have to go to the bathroom.

14:23.760 --> 14:25.432
Well, what was I thinking?

14:25.680 --> 14:29.116
Have a Big Gulp,
then chain myself to the goal post.

14:29.800 --> 14:31.756
Good move, Al.

14:32.000 --> 14:35.834
Oh, no one's around.
Maybe if l... Maybe if I hurry.

14:55.000 --> 14:57.116
Hi, Daddy. Guess what?

14:57.360 --> 15:00.989
My dreams of having a daughter with
her own insect car finally come true?

15:01.840 --> 15:05.310
You guessed. It's called the bug-mobile
and the company said...

15:05.560 --> 15:09.075
...that I could take it whenever I want.
- That's great, sweetheart.

15:09.320 --> 15:12.039
- Could you unlock me now, please?
- Wait. First...

15:12.280 --> 15:13.679
...guess where I went today?

15:13.920 --> 15:16.559
- The moon?
- Better.

15:16.800 --> 15:19.633
The Chicago Institute
of Bugs and Vermin.

15:19.880 --> 15:22.792
They've some of the rarest and most
dangerous bugs in the world.

15:23.040 --> 15:26.476
Like, take these
African Ping Beetles here.

15:26.720 --> 15:29.393
There's only six of them in the world.
It's a good thing...

15:29.600 --> 15:32.353
...because one bite
will nuke your entire metabolic system.

15:33.120 --> 15:36.874
Could you back the jar up a little bit?

15:37.520 --> 15:38.839
Don't worry about it, Daddy.

15:39.080 --> 15:43.312
I made sure before I took them that
I made the holes too small for any...

15:44.920 --> 15:46.478
What?

15:47.200 --> 15:49.998
Did I say six? I guess I meant five.

15:50.360 --> 15:52.954
- So how was your day?
- Oh, just a typical day.

15:53.200 --> 15:55.953
Didn't sell any shoes,
didn't get to pee, you know.

15:56.200 --> 15:58.077
Could you please unlock me now?

16:00.600 --> 16:03.398
- Oh, no.
- Don't get mad, okay?

16:03.800 --> 16:06.234
Before the museum,
I went to the railroad tracks...

16:06.440 --> 16:09.398
...with my friends and they
were putting pennies on the tracks...

16:09.600 --> 16:11.192
...and watching them get squished...

16:11.400 --> 16:14.517
...but I didn't do that, because
you told me never to waste money.

16:18.880 --> 16:22.111
But a key isn't money,
is it, sweetheart?

16:23.120 --> 16:25.270
No!

16:25.920 --> 16:27.319
Look.

16:27.560 --> 16:30.438
It's kind of awesome
when you think about it, huh?

16:31.040 --> 16:32.519
The pressure it took to do this.

16:34.720 --> 16:37.314
But how am I gonna
get out of here now?

16:37.560 --> 16:38.993
I thought about that too.

16:39.240 --> 16:42.869
All we have to do is take the lock...

16:43.480 --> 16:46.916
...put it on the tracks
and squish that too...

16:47.160 --> 16:49.116
...and the key should fit.

16:55.480 --> 16:57.994
I have a better idea, sweetheart.

16:58.240 --> 17:01.710
Since the lock is attached
to the goal post...

17:01.960 --> 17:05.509
...why don't you go down,
stand on the railroad tracks...

17:05.760 --> 17:09.673
...and try to get them
to bring the train over here?

17:12.160 --> 17:13.912
Gotcha.

17:14.920 --> 17:16.147
Oh, Daddy, one more thing.

17:16.400 --> 17:19.869
If you see a brown bug
with three sixes on its belly...

17:20.119 --> 17:23.795
...that's the African Ping.
It's very deadly.

17:24.040 --> 17:27.430
So run for your life, okay? Bye.

17:35.280 --> 17:39.239
Oh, well, one killer beetle
loose in a city this size.

17:39.480 --> 17:41.038
What are my odds of getting bit?

17:41.280 --> 17:44.477
I mean, even my luck
couldn't be that bad.

17:50.840 --> 17:52.068
Ladies and gentlemen...

17:52.320 --> 17:56.029
...announcing your all-time,
all-pro America's dream team...

17:56.280 --> 17:59.955
...quarterback Joe Namath,
halfback Jim Brown...

18:00.200 --> 18:03.476
...fullback Al Bundy!

18:07.080 --> 18:10.516
Al Bundy! Al Bundy! Al Bundy!

18:10.760 --> 18:13.069
- AI Bundy!
- AI Bundy!

18:13.320 --> 18:14.878
Al Bundy!

18:16.240 --> 18:18.470
Oh, Marcie.

18:18.720 --> 18:20.711
Thank God it's you.

18:20.960 --> 18:23.872
I thought the goal post
had grown unsightly stubble.

18:25.960 --> 18:29.953
You know, I admire you, Al.
I didn't think you'd last this long.

18:30.200 --> 18:33.636
The groundbreaking is in a couple of
hours. A squirming shoe salesman...

18:33.840 --> 18:36.673
...under a bulldozer
will not look good in the papers.

18:36.920 --> 18:38.638
So we're prepared
to make you an offer.

18:38.880 --> 18:41.599
An offer? You mean money?

18:41.840 --> 18:44.593
Al Bundy is not for sale.

18:47.560 --> 18:50.438
I'm not standing here
for myself alone...

18:50.680 --> 18:53.717
...but for every guy
that ever scored a touchdown.

18:53.960 --> 18:59.830
Oh, look, a double cheeseburger
with fries.

19:00.840 --> 19:03.593
For every Dad
that ever took his kid to a game.

19:03.840 --> 19:07.594
For every man that ever married
the wrong woman.

19:07.800 --> 19:10.030
Is there bacon in there?

19:10.320 --> 19:13.153
I don't even care
if those are curly fries.

19:13.400 --> 19:15.072
Are they curly fries?

19:15.320 --> 19:18.118
Never mind! I stand fast.

19:18.360 --> 19:22.672
If you want to build a factory here,
you'll have to build it over me.

19:28.920 --> 19:30.399
Alrighty.

19:30.640 --> 19:32.835
Plough him under!

19:45.840 --> 19:47.637
I'll always have my memories.

19:47.880 --> 19:49.313
- What is the offer?
- This burger.

19:49.560 --> 19:50.959
Done.

19:57.280 --> 20:01.353
Gee, Al, those insect bites
look pretty nasty.

20:02.120 --> 20:03.439
Insect bites?

20:03.680 --> 20:05.716
Oh, thank God.

20:05.960 --> 20:08.872
I thought they were hickeys
from that bum over there.

20:09.760 --> 20:12.354
I'll tell you what I'll do.
Insofar as I'm moving out...

20:12.560 --> 20:15.472
...and will never see you again,
I'll take you to the hospital.

20:15.720 --> 20:18.553
- You'd do that for me?
- Sure. But I just had my car detailed...

20:18.760 --> 20:20.352
...so climb in the trunk.

20:21.680 --> 20:25.229
And in an ironic twist of fate,
it took the near death...

20:25.480 --> 20:29.234
...of plant protester/women's
shoe salesman, Al Bundy...

20:29.480 --> 20:32.597
...to halt the construction
of the proposed Haguar plant...

20:32.800 --> 20:35.553
...when it was determined
that the bites covering his body...

20:35.800 --> 20:39.156
...were caused by the rare
and poisonous African Ping Beetle.

20:42.120 --> 20:44.839
Though no one gave a damn
about Mr. Bundy's protest...

20:45.080 --> 20:48.993
...environmentalists insist that
Polk field must now be protected...

20:49.240 --> 20:51.515
...since this useless
but endangered insect...

20:51.760 --> 20:54.672
...has apparently established
a colony there.

20:54.920 --> 20:58.515
I can't believe it. I mean, how did these
beetles get here from Africa anyway?

21:01.560 --> 21:04.870
There's no way they could escape
from the Institute of Bugs and Vermin...

21:05.120 --> 21:07.873
...because that place is a fortress.

21:09.440 --> 21:12.910
Plans for the Haguar factory
have officially been moved to Canada...

21:13.160 --> 21:18.154
...with a loss to this community of
21, 000 jobs and millions of dollars.

21:21.880 --> 21:24.678
The plant would have benefited
every segment of the economy...

21:24.880 --> 21:26.359
...from housing to shoe sales.

21:26.600 --> 21:32.197
Truly this is a story
with no winners. Only losers.
