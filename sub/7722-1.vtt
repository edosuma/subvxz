00:50.560 --> 00:52.060
BRAD: Here's a question for you.

00:52.160 --> 00:56.085
What do kids need more? A father or a dad?

00:56.400 --> 00:57.731
What's the difference?

00:58.040 --> 01:00.540
The way I see it, darn near
anyone can be a father...

01:00.640 --> 01:01.580
(ROARING)

01:01.680 --> 01:04.364
...but not everyone has the patience
or the devotion to be a dad.

01:04.720 --> 01:05.700
As for me...

01:05.800 --> 01:07.040
Anybody caught a Monarch yet?

01:07.160 --> 01:08.900
...I've always wanted to be a dad.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.540
Let me tell you, I love it!

01:11.640 --> 01:12.641
Yeah!

01:12.840 --> 01:13.980
(ALL CHEERING)

01:14.080 --> 01:15.491
And I love my Ford Flex.

01:16.000 --> 01:18.300
It treats me to a smooth ride,
and you know what?

01:18.400 --> 01:19.686
It didn't break the bank.

01:20.200 --> 01:22.202
Room enough for the whole family.

01:22.320 --> 01:24.527
Yes, I love being a dad.

01:25.480 --> 01:29.041
And I love these two adorable
little rays of sunshine.

01:31.000 --> 01:32.460
Hey, Dylan! Good morning.

01:32.560 --> 01:33.561
Whatever.

01:34.560 --> 01:36.767
BRAD: Okay. I'm not their real dad.

01:37.400 --> 01:38.500
Good morning, Mr. Whitaker.

01:38.600 --> 01:40.700
- I'm their stepdad.
- Good morning, Megan.

01:40.800 --> 01:42.484
Can you please put this on the fridge?

01:42.880 --> 01:46.680
Well, sure. Did you do
another drawing of our family?

01:46.960 --> 01:48.220
- Uh-huh.
- Huh?

01:48.320 --> 01:51.483
That's me and Dylan and Mommy.

01:51.680 --> 01:52.620
So great.

01:52.720 --> 01:55.769
And over here, far, far away,

01:56.320 --> 01:57.260
is you.

01:57.360 --> 02:00.204
Oh? And am I wearing a baseball cap?

02:00.520 --> 02:03.888
That's the knife in your head
'cause I was killing you in the eye.

02:04.600 --> 02:05.660
Oh, I see.

02:05.760 --> 02:07.364
Well, I love how you drew my hair.

02:08.039 --> 02:09.201
That's poop.

02:09.880 --> 02:12.565
Well, it's well-drawn.
And I'm guessing it's dog poop?

02:12.760 --> 02:14.300
That's homeless man poop.

02:14.400 --> 02:15.401
Oh.

02:16.640 --> 02:17.641
All right. (SIGHING)

02:18.600 --> 02:20.740
BRAD: I actually can't
father my own children,

02:20.840 --> 02:23.525
ever since I hit a little
snafu at a dental office.

02:23.880 --> 02:26.100
(MUFFLED) I've got
a little bit of a gag reflex.

02:26.200 --> 02:27.980
Uh, close your eyes, breathe through
your nose, you'll be fine.

02:28.080 --> 02:29.241
Oh. Okay.

02:29.400 --> 02:30.925
(INHALES DEEPLY)

02:34.920 --> 02:36.001
(BEEPS)

02:36.680 --> 02:39.570
Oh, you got a really weird tongue.
You need to floss better.

02:39.720 --> 02:43.060
BRAD: Ever since then, my testicles have
been more decorative than anything else.

02:43.160 --> 02:44.180
Hey!

02:44.280 --> 02:46.442
And I thought I'd never have a family.

02:46.760 --> 02:50.003
Until I met a stunning mom named Sara.

02:51.080 --> 02:52.445
Would you look at her?

02:52.680 --> 02:55.843
I am one lucky so-and-so.
I hit the jackpot.

02:56.080 --> 02:57.161
- Hi.
- Hi.

02:57.280 --> 02:58.900
Sorry I'm taking so long.

02:59.000 --> 03:01.380
I have to show that Sixty West
building to those new clients.

03:01.480 --> 03:02.460
- I know.
- (GASPS)

03:02.560 --> 03:05.220
- Oh, my God! The kids' lunches.
- Already packed. I wrote them

03:05.320 --> 03:07.687
little inspirational notes
to start them on their day.

03:07.840 --> 03:10.081
They've already eaten their breakfasts,
and you look perfect.

03:10.600 --> 03:12.090
You are amazing.

03:13.440 --> 03:15.940
Look at this, huh? Another family drawing.

03:16.040 --> 03:18.060
Oh, no. I am so sorry.

03:18.160 --> 03:20.740
No, I think you're misunderstanding.
This is the first drawing

03:20.840 --> 03:22.922
where I'm not dead already.

03:23.520 --> 03:27.209
Sure, I've got a knife in my eye
and some homeless man poop on my head,

03:27.920 --> 03:30.620
(SIGHING)
but this is showing real progress.

03:30.720 --> 03:32.643
I think she's starting to accept me.

03:32.760 --> 03:34.740
You can find the good
in just about anything.

03:34.840 --> 03:37.081
I love that about you. You know that?

03:37.440 --> 03:38.540
Thanks.

03:38.640 --> 03:40.051
(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)

04:25.960 --> 04:28.008
Hello. I'm home.

04:29.360 --> 04:30.361
Hey.

04:30.800 --> 04:32.131
How was the, uh...

04:34.640 --> 04:35.620
What's wrong?

04:35.720 --> 04:37.802
He won't talk to me.
He said he only wants to talk to you.

04:39.600 --> 04:40.620
You want to talk to me?

04:40.720 --> 04:42.180
- Really?
- Mmm-hmm.

04:42.280 --> 04:44.020
- You mean me and your mom?
- Mmm-mmm.

04:44.120 --> 04:45.820
- Just me? By myself?
- Mmm-hmm.

04:45.920 --> 04:47.410
Sure. I'm...

04:48.320 --> 04:51.130
I'm totally free. Let's go to the den.
We'll sit there.

04:51.320 --> 04:53.561
We'll sit.
We can do it sitting or standing?

04:54.160 --> 04:55.844
Doesn't matter. We're just gonna do it.

04:56.160 --> 04:58.891
We're not gonna overthink it.
Yeah. Great. Okay, good.

04:59.680 --> 05:04.004
Just the men, yeah.
A little rap session. Great.

05:04.680 --> 05:05.841
(WHISPERING) Oh, my God.

05:07.760 --> 05:11.003
I just want you to know that
I'm just here to listen. All right?

05:11.360 --> 05:15.046
No judgments, no lectures,
just a compassionate ear.

05:15.960 --> 05:18.220
- Well, there are these kids at school...
- Mmm-hmm.

05:18.320 --> 05:20.460
...and they're bigger than me,
because they're fourth graders.

05:20.560 --> 05:22.403
- (SHUTTER CLICKING)
- And...

05:24.440 --> 05:25.885
Oh, was that weird?

05:26.440 --> 05:27.851
I'm sorry, I'm just...

05:28.360 --> 05:31.380
It's a big moment for me,
and I'm just trying to capture it.

05:31.480 --> 05:32.845
It just came off awkward.

05:33.360 --> 05:36.887
So, go ahead, continue telling
your story. Fourth graders.

05:37.120 --> 05:39.122
Anyway, there are
these fourth graders, and...

05:39.320 --> 05:40.924
He actually confided in me.

05:41.040 --> 05:44.260
I mean, it was that father-son feeling
I've been dying for,

05:44.360 --> 05:47.045
and it was even better than
I thought it was gonna be.

05:47.600 --> 05:50.140
(SIGHS) I mean, he really needed me. Me.

05:50.240 --> 05:51.420
That is so great, honey.

05:51.520 --> 05:52.780
He even said not to tell you.

05:52.880 --> 05:56.500
So I'm actually totally betraying
his trust right now. (CHUCKLES)

05:56.600 --> 05:58.807
What are we gonna do about
those little snot-nosed fourth graders?

05:58.920 --> 06:00.340
Oh, I think it's going to be fine.

06:00.440 --> 06:03.967
He's going to try to do some
trust falls on the playground.

06:04.400 --> 06:05.606
Really? You think that's gonna work?

06:05.760 --> 06:07.888
As long as they catch him. Yeah.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.001
Hey, Brad.

06:09.440 --> 06:10.420
Yeah?

06:10.520 --> 06:13.683
If I ask you something,
you promise you won't cry again?

06:14.000 --> 06:15.500
Of course, sweetie. What is it?

06:15.600 --> 06:18.285
Well, at school,
they told us about this thing,

06:18.440 --> 06:20.100
and it's called a Daddy-Daughter Dance.

06:20.200 --> 06:21.804
(GASPING)

06:22.280 --> 06:23.740
So, do you want to go with me?

06:23.840 --> 06:25.126
(SOBBING)

06:25.360 --> 06:26.930
You said you wouldn't cry, Brad.

06:27.160 --> 06:30.846
I'm not. Megan, yes. A million times yes.

06:31.160 --> 06:33.060
I thought big people
weren't supposed to cry.

06:33.160 --> 06:35.925
I think it's sweet that he's
crying like a little bitch.

06:36.040 --> 06:37.300
(GASPS) Megan!

06:37.400 --> 06:39.209
You are not supposed
to call people that word.

06:39.520 --> 06:42.500
You know what? It takes a real
man to show his emotions.

06:42.600 --> 06:44.204
(SOBBING LOUDLY)

06:45.680 --> 06:47.205
All right, that's a bit much.

VIZZINI: No more rhymes now, I mean it!

(ALL LAUGHING)

06:54.360 --> 06:57.045
BRAD: We were finally becoming a family.

06:57.520 --> 06:58.580
- (PHONE RINGING)
- I'll get it!

06:58.680 --> 07:01.524
After being pushed away
and treated like an outsider,

07:01.720 --> 07:04.291
I was finally becoming
the dad that I always knew I could...

07:04.480 --> 07:05.527
Daddy!

07:06.040 --> 07:08.247
Hi! Where are you?

07:08.720 --> 07:10.051
Where's Cameroon?

07:10.200 --> 07:12.202
Is that gunfire? Cool!

07:12.400 --> 07:14.528
MEGAN: Daddy, Daddy!
I want to talk to Daddy.

07:15.720 --> 07:16.721
Hi, Daddy.

07:17.040 --> 07:18.041
Good.

07:18.240 --> 07:20.083
- So your ex is calling, huh?
- (SIGHS) Yeah.

07:20.200 --> 07:22.980
What a treat for the kids.
It's been a long time.

07:23.080 --> 07:24.206
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

07:24.400 --> 07:27.404
We're watching a really funny
movie with Mommy and Brad.

07:28.040 --> 07:29.530
Oh, Brad is Mommy's new husband.

07:29.920 --> 07:31.570
Wait. He doesn't know about me?

07:31.920 --> 07:34.400
Well, I haven't talked to him
in six months.

07:34.720 --> 07:35.940
We've been married eight months.

07:36.040 --> 07:37.849
Brad, Daddy wants to talk to you.

07:38.080 --> 07:40.260
- No! No, no. Don't, don't...
- I'm just going to say hi.

07:40.360 --> 07:41.860
You don't need to do that. Brad, don't.

07:41.960 --> 07:43.724
(CLEARS THROAT) Thank you, sweetie.

07:44.240 --> 07:46.766
Hello, Dusty?
Super to make your acquaintance.

07:47.560 --> 07:49.300
In fact, I just wish
I could shake your hand

07:49.400 --> 07:51.562
and offer to buy you a cold one.

07:52.240 --> 07:53.620
- Tomorrow?
- What?

07:53.720 --> 07:55.848
BOTH: Daddy's coming! Yay!

07:56.560 --> 07:58.085
Oh, yeah, I guess I could pick you up.

07:58.520 --> 07:59.601
- (WHISPERS) No.
- Hmm?

07:59.920 --> 08:01.081
It's Whitaker.

08:01.280 --> 08:05.968
W-H-I-T-A-K-E-R. (CHUCKLES)

08:06.440 --> 08:08.931
No, I'm not comfortable giving you
my Social Security number over the phone.

08:09.920 --> 08:13.460
Uh, okay, yeah, my credit score is 752.

08:13.560 --> 08:14.700
I'm very proud of that. (CHUCKLES)

08:14.800 --> 08:18.247
I'm sorry? What sort of fighting styles
am I proficient in?

08:19.080 --> 08:20.570
I don't know if I've ever been
asked that before.

08:20.800 --> 08:23.007
Hello, Dusty, hello, hello? Hmm...

08:24.360 --> 08:25.486
I lost him.

08:25.760 --> 08:27.922
What just happened?
Did you just invite him to come here?

08:28.040 --> 08:29.610
Is he coming tomorrow?

08:29.880 --> 08:31.380
Well, I didn't know
he'd accept my offer so soon.

08:31.480 --> 08:33.340
I mean, he really jumped at it.

08:33.440 --> 08:37.380
Remember when I said he was like Jesse
James and Mick Jagger had a baby?

08:37.480 --> 08:40.768
Yeah, I just thought maybe
he was really skinny and

08:40.919 --> 08:44.580
jittery, and had like a little bit
of a British accent, or something.

08:44.680 --> 08:47.251
He's wild and he's crazy.
That's why I fell in love with him.

08:47.520 --> 08:48.620
Then you end up with two kids.

08:48.720 --> 08:51.260
And I'm stuck there holding the bag and
he's nowhere to be found.

08:51.360 --> 08:54.645
It doesn't matter how much love or passion,
or you can't breathe without each other.

08:54.760 --> 08:56.728
All of that stuff is stupid in comparison.

08:57.080 --> 08:58.525
When you have kids,
you have responsibilities.

08:58.640 --> 08:59.721
He doesn't understand that.

08:59.960 --> 09:01.644
Honey, this is actually a good thing.

09:01.800 --> 09:03.370
- (SIGHS)
- I'll welcome Dusty into our home,

09:03.480 --> 09:06.643
and we'll establish some kind
but firm boundaries.

09:06.800 --> 09:09.804
All right? It's what Step-By-Stepdad
calls "setting up a Loving Fence."

09:10.040 --> 09:12.725
A Loving Fence?
Wow, that sounds really great, honey.

09:12.960 --> 09:15.725
But your self-help books
have never met Dusty Mayron.

09:15.960 --> 09:19.244
He sounds like a rascal, but I don't
think it's anything I can't handle.

Oh, Mr. Holt, hello. Well, hopefully
the new voice of The Panda.

09:40.160 --> 09:41.241
Oh, listen.

09:41.400 --> 09:44.768
I gotta leave early today. I gotta go
pick up my wife's ex at the airport.

09:45.000 --> 09:47.924
Jesus, kid, how'd you
draw that shit detail?

09:48.480 --> 09:50.562
Brad, why do you want
this deadbeat in your home?

09:50.680 --> 09:53.260
Well, it's not that I want him in my home,

09:53.360 --> 09:55.820
it's just that the better
stepparenting books

09:55.920 --> 10:00.123
say that the worst thing you can do
for the kids is to push out the biological.

10:00.360 --> 10:02.840
You're in the danger zone here,
Brad, and let me tell you why.

10:03.200 --> 10:06.761
Kids that grow up without their dads
always end up obsessing over them.

10:07.160 --> 10:09.740
Most of the hook-ups
that I've had in my adult life

10:09.840 --> 10:11.683
have been with women
that had daddy issues.

10:11.840 --> 10:13.569
I don't know if this is
an appropriate story.

10:13.680 --> 10:15.820
Look, my wife would kill me
if she knew I was telling you this.

10:15.920 --> 10:17.570
Well, then you shouldn't tell me this.

10:17.840 --> 10:18.860
When I met her in Denver...

10:18.960 --> 10:20.100
You're going to tell
the story, aren't you?

10:20.200 --> 10:21.780
...she was a topless maid.

10:21.880 --> 10:23.700
- Ninety-nine bucks an hour.
- Mmm-hmm.

10:23.800 --> 10:26.963
Never met her father.
But who did she meet? Me.

10:27.360 --> 10:30.420
And who did treat her like shit? Me.

10:30.520 --> 10:33.780
I eventually loved her,
but every time she got out of line,

10:33.880 --> 10:37.565
I'd just pull the Humvee over
and ask her to get out politely.

10:37.680 --> 10:39.045
And then I'd drive away.

10:39.400 --> 10:43.405
Guess what?
She showed up at home every time.

10:43.640 --> 10:46.086
This story has no relevance
to my situation.

10:46.320 --> 10:48.641
Oh, it doesn't at all.
It's just a good story.

10:48.800 --> 10:50.643
So, Pete, are we going
to hear this guy, or what?

11:01.400 --> 11:02.401
I'm sorry.

11:02.760 --> 11:06.765
Keep it up, Brad.
You and I will fight in the parking lot.

11:07.920 --> 11:11.242
BRAD: So today is the day I'm finally
meeting the father of my children.

11:11.600 --> 11:14.251
Am I nervous? You're darn right I am.

11:14.360 --> 11:17.091
But who wouldn't be? (SIGHS DEEPLY)

11:17.360 --> 11:20.603
And here's the thing.
I mean, Pepe, you know, kids...

11:20.760 --> 11:23.809
...they see through things and,
at the end of the day,

11:24.280 --> 11:25.691
they know who's been around...

11:26.120 --> 11:27.485
Holy balls!

There is no doubt this man
is your better in every way.

11:54.480 --> 11:56.642
Well, you're kind to say that. Thank you.

11:57.320 --> 11:59.641
Yeah, I feel pretty good.

12:02.320 --> 12:04.163
- Hey, you Dusty?
- Nope.

12:04.800 --> 12:05.961
What?

12:06.840 --> 12:08.365
Are you sure?

12:12.320 --> 12:14.243
Are you Dusty... No, you're not Dusty.

in the office can agree on.

do yourself a favor and check out...

(DOOR OPENING)

12:28.320 --> 12:30.527
Hey! Where have you been?

12:31.200 --> 12:32.300
I called you like 100 times.

12:32.400 --> 12:34.323
(SIGHS) I know, my phone died. Look...

12:35.000 --> 12:36.001
This motorcycle, is this...

12:36.160 --> 12:37.161
Yes. He's here.

12:37.280 --> 12:38.500
- He's here?
- Yes.

12:38.600 --> 12:40.060
What's he doing inside there?

12:40.160 --> 12:42.128
He's giving the kids
all kinds of Starbursts.

12:42.440 --> 12:44.283
Starbursts? God damn it!

12:44.520 --> 12:47.364
Sorry. Sorry. (EXHALES)

12:47.520 --> 12:49.841
I'm a hot habanero pepper right now.

12:50.120 --> 12:52.930
I got a few bullet points I want to
bring up with our friend Dusty,

courtesy and expectation.

You like that story? It's all true. Hey!

13:01.280 --> 13:05.046
Who wants some more Starbursts and
a couple of uncirculated silver dollars?

13:05.280 --> 13:06.611
So you are Dusty.

13:06.800 --> 13:08.484
(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)

13:21.880 --> 13:24.620
I sure am. You must be
the new and improved husband.

13:24.720 --> 13:26.404
Bring it in, big guns.

13:27.560 --> 13:29.050
I already met you at the airport.

13:29.160 --> 13:30.366
No, I don't recall that, friend.

13:30.480 --> 13:32.323
Yeah, I walked right up to you
and asked if you were Dusty.

13:32.480 --> 13:34.540
I'm pretty sure I'd remember
a heavy hitter like yourself.

13:34.640 --> 13:35.780
(SCOFFS)

13:35.880 --> 13:37.006
Well, must have been my mistake.

13:37.720 --> 13:39.180
All right, that was me at the airport.

13:39.280 --> 13:40.820
- Yeah, I know that.
- The truth is,

13:40.920 --> 13:42.300
I saw you before you saw me,

13:42.400 --> 13:44.528
and I'm thinking,
"This is the guy who's raising my kids?"

13:44.920 --> 13:46.900
"And damn it if he doesn't
look like the real deal."

13:47.000 --> 13:48.060
I mean, look at you.

13:48.160 --> 13:49.620
You figured it out, didn't you?

13:49.720 --> 13:50.820
You cracked the code.

13:50.920 --> 13:52.251
(CHUCKLES) I don't know about that.

13:52.480 --> 13:53.845
Don't play that humble game with me.

13:54.640 --> 13:57.120
He is so humble. He's just too humble.

13:57.240 --> 14:00.580
Honey, you got it goin' on.
Everybody says so.

14:00.680 --> 14:02.603
Yeah, I got it goin' way on.

14:02.920 --> 14:04.604
So you can understand
why I panicked at the airport.

14:04.840 --> 14:07.081
- I froze, Brad. I'm sorry.
- It's fine.

14:07.200 --> 14:09.202
Look, these are tricky waters to navigate.

14:09.520 --> 14:11.682
They sure are, man. I mean,
that is insightful.

14:12.120 --> 14:14.500
You know, I thought it was weird Sara
didn't tell me about you before.

14:14.600 --> 14:16.045
I thought, what's she hiding?

14:16.280 --> 14:17.611
And now I know.

14:18.520 --> 14:19.681
A champion.

14:20.440 --> 14:23.125
Hey, Brad! Did you see Dad's motorcycle?

14:23.440 --> 14:24.580
Isn't it cool?

14:24.680 --> 14:25.681
BRAD: It sure is.

14:26.960 --> 14:28.610
What is that, an Indian?

14:28.800 --> 14:29.801
Yep.

14:30.120 --> 14:32.646

in Minneapolis.

for The Mary Tyler Moore Show.

14:40.800 --> 14:42.962
Which I want to say was a spin-off.

14:44.120 --> 14:47.020
Damn! You really know
your bikes, Brad. You ride?

14:47.120 --> 14:48.121
Uh-huh. Yeah!

14:48.480 --> 14:49.481
- Really?
- BRAD: Yeah.

14:49.720 --> 14:52.166
I mean, not anymore. I did, you know,

14:52.280 --> 14:55.540
back in college. I had a, um...

14:55.640 --> 14:58.166
I had a Kawa-saki? Kawasaki Nine.

14:58.280 --> 14:59.380
Yeah.

14:59.480 --> 15:03.380
With the fenders and the...
The broil joint. So...

15:03.480 --> 15:04.641
Well, you should get on her, man. Come on!

15:04.760 --> 15:06.060
Take her out, see what she can do.

15:06.160 --> 15:07.100
She's got a lot of power.

15:07.200 --> 15:08.340
Oh, no, no, no.

15:08.440 --> 15:10.020
Yeah, Brad! Brad... Please!

15:10.120 --> 15:12.202
No. Hey, come on, kids. It's time for bed.

15:12.360 --> 15:14.060
It's way past your bedtime.
Let's brush your teeth.

15:14.160 --> 15:16.481
All right, come on, guys,
listen to your mom. Hey, look...

15:16.600 --> 15:18.841
(STUTTERS) I don't want to overstep, but

15:19.240 --> 15:22.244
it would mean the world to me
if I could tuck in our two little blessings.

15:23.160 --> 15:27.563
Yeah. Yeah, sure, of course.
They're your kids. Tuck away.

15:27.760 --> 15:29.364
Oh, thank you for that, Brad.

15:31.200 --> 15:34.522
The King messed up. He messed up bad.

15:34.840 --> 15:37.260
He thought he could just
ride off to slay dragons,

15:37.360 --> 15:39.840
and his Queen would always be
waiting for him.

15:40.120 --> 15:43.883
And then one day the King received word
that his dominion was being ruled over

15:44.040 --> 15:46.180
by some curly-headed Step King
with good credit?

15:46.280 --> 15:47.340
Oh, no!

15:47.440 --> 15:50.611
Well, the King rode hard up on his lands,
and when he arrived,

15:50.880 --> 15:54.362
he did gaze fondly upon the Queen,
remembering their good times together,

15:54.480 --> 15:57.300
for he had known her in her prime,
when she was down for anything,

15:57.400 --> 15:58.820
and I do mean anything.

15:58.920 --> 15:59.921
Psst...

16:00.120 --> 16:03.060
Sounds like your dad's spinning
quite a yarn. Mind if I listen in?

16:03.160 --> 16:05.700
Oh, actually, it's getting late.
You two need to get some sack time.

16:05.800 --> 16:07.700
BOTH: No, we want more story, please!

16:07.800 --> 16:11.620
Hey, I'd love to be in here all night,
but let's be respectful of Brad's rules,

16:11.720 --> 16:13.722
no matter how arbitrary they seem.
All right?

16:14.160 --> 16:16.162
Good night, my little golden treasures.

16:19.800 --> 16:22.485
Good night, my little magical cherubs.

- Here comes some butterfly kisses.

16:35.320 --> 16:36.820
Good night, my little Jesus teardrop.

16:36.920 --> 16:40.820
I almost forgot, my famous
good-night back scratches.

16:40.920 --> 16:42.980
- Oh, so relaxing, so relaxing.
- (SIGHING)

16:43.080 --> 16:44.140
Good night, sweetie bear.

16:44.240 --> 16:45.940
Hey, who wants twenty bucks?

16:46.040 --> 16:47.700
- BOTH: I do! Me!
- Twenty dollars?

16:47.800 --> 16:49.380
- What?
- Oh, yeah.

16:49.480 --> 16:51.540
One for you, and one for you.

16:51.640 --> 16:52.660
I don't know if that's appropriate.

16:52.760 --> 16:53.740
Ah, don't worry about it.

16:53.840 --> 16:54.921
BRAD: Okay. Good night.

16:56.760 --> 16:59.923
So, uh, if you want to, why don't you
come by tomorrow after school?

17:00.080 --> 17:01.100
Might be a good time to...

17:01.200 --> 17:02.260
What about the cold one?

17:02.360 --> 17:03.340
The cold one?

17:03.440 --> 17:05.500
You promised me
a cold one and a handshake.

17:05.599 --> 17:07.420
Cold one. One cold one, coming up.

17:07.520 --> 17:09.180
Great. I'll grab my jacket,
we'll go outside.

17:09.280 --> 17:10.520
Perfect. All right.

17:11.440 --> 17:12.441
Hey! Psst...

17:12.599 --> 17:15.260
What are you doing?
What are you guys buddies now?

17:15.359 --> 17:17.859
No. I mean, I offered him a cold one.

17:17.960 --> 17:20.122
I really should honor
the cold one promise.

17:20.440 --> 17:23.842
(SIGHS) Fine. You give him a cold one,
and then you get rid of him, okay?

17:24.119 --> 17:25.140
You put up your Loving Fence,

17:25.240 --> 17:26.220
- remember?
- Mmm-hmm.

17:26.319 --> 17:28.003
- Then you come to bed.
- Okay.

17:28.960 --> 17:30.121
- Will do.
- Okay.

17:33.880 --> 17:35.405
DUSTY: What you got going on over here?

17:35.640 --> 17:39.486
Oh, uh, that's a treehouse. A little, uh,

17:40.160 --> 17:43.164
bonding project for Dylan and I.

17:43.480 --> 17:45.721
Yeah, we've been at it
for about two months.

17:46.000 --> 17:47.001
DUSTY: It's looking good.

17:47.160 --> 17:48.161
BRAD: Thank you.

17:48.400 --> 17:52.371
So, Dusty, how long do you think
you're going to be in town for?

17:53.080 --> 17:56.100
Well, Brad, the truth is,
I'm wheels-up a week from tomorrow.

17:56.200 --> 17:58.441
Time to get out there and
kick some ass for America.

17:58.560 --> 18:00.847
Oh, I see. So you're a soldier?

18:01.000 --> 18:02.001
Nope.

18:02.320 --> 18:03.401
Oh, so you're a, uh...

18:03.600 --> 18:04.681
Yep.

18:05.240 --> 18:06.605
Yep, what?

18:06.840 --> 18:08.604
(CHUCKLES) You don't want to know
any more than that, Brad.

18:09.600 --> 18:10.601
Okay.

18:12.160 --> 18:16.820
Um, listen, Dusty, I think that we should
set up a visitation schedule.

18:16.920 --> 18:20.540
Right? That way, you feel like
you have ample time with the children...

18:20.640 --> 18:22.210
Why don't we cut the shit, Brad?

18:23.680 --> 18:25.682
No, we don't have to cut the shit.

18:26.040 --> 18:28.620
You want to know what I'm doing here,
why don't you quit looking at

18:28.720 --> 18:30.210
whatever you wrote on your hand?

18:30.520 --> 18:33.364
Be a man and ask me, Brad.

18:33.680 --> 18:35.887
Okay. What are you doing here?

18:36.200 --> 18:39.522
Now, we both know kids need
a single primary male role model.

18:39.880 --> 18:41.723
Sara's made her choice.

18:42.200 --> 18:44.282
I'm man enough to
let that role model be you.

18:44.920 --> 18:46.888
I will vouch for you with my children.

18:47.280 --> 18:50.045
I will give them my sacred
permission to trust you.

18:50.480 --> 18:51.891
To love you and to

18:53.080 --> 18:54.411
call you Dad.

18:54.920 --> 18:55.921
You'd do that for me?

18:56.080 --> 18:57.081
No.

18:58.040 --> 18:59.724
But I will do it for them.

19:00.440 --> 19:02.602
That is what you want, isn't it, Brad?

19:03.120 --> 19:05.122
More than anything in the world.

19:06.120 --> 19:09.090
He played you.
You just got so played out there.

19:09.280 --> 19:13.140
I know it looks that way, 'cause
I promised I would ask him to leave,

19:13.240 --> 19:16.722
and then I invited him to stay for a week,
but he didn't play me.

19:16.880 --> 19:19.201
You know what he did? He cut the shit.

19:19.320 --> 19:22.620
- Oh, he did?
- And I gotta say, it was refreshing.

19:22.720 --> 19:26.088
I think more of us could stand
to just cut the shit, you know.

19:26.240 --> 19:28.004
- Right.
- In one conversation,

19:28.200 --> 19:30.601
he just blew by
eight chapters in my stepdad book.

19:30.760 --> 19:32.980
I mean, this is gonna be so good
for me and the kids.

19:33.080 --> 19:36.084
Oh, baby, you have no idea
who you're dancing with.

19:36.440 --> 19:37.580
Dusty gets into your head,

19:37.680 --> 19:38.740
- that's what he does.
- (WHIRRING)

19:38.840 --> 19:41.660
(MUFFLED) He has a very impressive,
rugged bravado,

19:41.760 --> 19:44.820
there's no question. But I gotta say,

19:44.920 --> 19:49.164
I think in here, there's
a soft, soft creamy center.

19:49.520 --> 19:51.660
You know? I think he feels a lot.

19:51.760 --> 19:54.923
He just... He needs
someone with this, a big ear.

19:55.120 --> 19:56.610
And I got them. Mmm.

20:01.280 --> 20:02.860
Oh, good morning, Dusty.

20:02.960 --> 20:04.340
- Hey.
- You're up and at 'em.

20:04.440 --> 20:05.521
- (OVEN TIMER DINGS)
- Yeah, I got up early

20:05.640 --> 20:06.700
- and did a quick 20.
- Really?

20:06.800 --> 20:08.564
- Twenty minutes of what?
- Oh, twenty miles.

20:08.960 --> 20:10.300
Did a little light sparring,
then I whipped up

20:10.400 --> 20:12.164
a pan of piping-hot
cinnamon rolls for my family.

20:12.720 --> 20:13.846
And I made one for you, too.

20:14.120 --> 20:16.691
Wow. That's very impressive, thank you.

20:17.160 --> 20:19.367
- DUSTY: Good morning, gang!
- Ooh, it smells yummy!

20:19.600 --> 20:22.444
Our real dad's a super,
super-duper good cook!

20:22.640 --> 20:24.085
- Mmm-hmm.
- Here you go, guys.

20:24.360 --> 20:27.420
Yeah, it looks an awful lot like Cinnabon.

20:27.520 --> 20:29.443
Well, thank you, Brad.
What a nice thing to say.

20:30.600 --> 20:32.340
Mmm, it tastes exactly like Cinnabon!

20:32.440 --> 20:35.100
In fact, same shape,
same swirl, same frosting.

20:35.200 --> 20:37.646
Now you're starting to embarrass me,
but I do appreciate the compliment.

20:38.440 --> 20:39.851
Good morning, Sar-bear!

20:40.240 --> 20:41.940
- Morning.
- Hey, listen, guys,

20:42.040 --> 20:44.611
Brad and I had a talk last night
about the importance of family.

20:44.760 --> 20:47.180
And now that everyone's here,
I wanted to say a few words, okay?

20:47.280 --> 20:48.420
I think that would be great.

20:48.520 --> 20:52.260
Hey, kids, you know, families can be
ever-growing and changing things.

20:52.360 --> 20:55.220
And sometimes someone new
knocks on the door of your heart

20:55.320 --> 20:57.620
and you're not sure if you
have room in there for one more.

20:57.720 --> 21:00.405
But there's someone here now
that I hope you guys can learn to love.

21:00.520 --> 21:01.521
Okay?

21:02.120 --> 21:03.406
(WHISTLING)

21:03.960 --> 21:06.042
- Come here, boy!
- (GROWLING)

21:06.160 --> 21:07.605
BOTH: A doggy! Yay!

21:09.320 --> 21:10.460
You brought a dog home?

21:10.560 --> 21:11.925
Yeah. Is that a problem?

21:12.080 --> 21:14.020
I mean, you seemed
really into it while I was teeing it up.

21:14.120 --> 21:15.460
No, I thought you were talking about me.

21:15.560 --> 21:17.460
- Oh, but you're not a dog, Brad.
- No... (SCOFFS)

21:17.560 --> 21:19.562
Look, last night, when we talked...

21:19.840 --> 21:22.002
Oh, yeah. Well, listen,
that's got to happen organically.

21:22.120 --> 21:23.180
Why can't it happen now?

21:23.280 --> 21:24.300
It just can't.

21:24.400 --> 21:25.420
You're dirty.

21:25.520 --> 21:26.567
SARA: Dusty, how old is that thing?

21:26.680 --> 21:28.205
I'd guess him to be around 15.

21:28.520 --> 21:30.363
I mean, I found him this morning,
living in a storm drain.

21:30.920 --> 21:32.940
I named him Tumor,
because of how much he grows on you.

21:33.040 --> 21:35.020
BOTH: Mommy, can we keep Tumor, please?

21:35.120 --> 21:36.740
Oh, I'm gonna leave this one up to Brad.

21:36.840 --> 21:38.410
BOTH: Please, Brad! Please!

21:39.360 --> 21:40.780
Why is he looking at me like that?

21:40.880 --> 21:42.689
- (GROWLING)
- He's only looking at me.

21:42.840 --> 21:44.740
Maybe we just get a puppy instead?

21:44.840 --> 21:47.491
A puppy, Brad? What are they
going to learn from a puppy?

21:47.760 --> 21:50.764
An old dog like Tumor here's
been out in the world, man. Living free.

21:51.000 --> 21:53.480
Fighting for survival and seeing things
we can only dream of.

21:53.880 --> 21:55.848
Just look at the wisdom
in those cloudy eyes.

21:56.120 --> 21:58.020
Besides, you know what happens
to old dogs at shelters.

21:58.120 --> 22:00.100
He's gonna have to walk the green mile
as soon as he gets there.

22:00.200 --> 22:02.220
No, Brad, no! Don't kill our dog!

22:02.320 --> 22:03.651
I hate you!

22:04.480 --> 22:06.642
Okay. Okay. Fine.

22:06.760 --> 22:09.764
He can live out his few
remaining weeks with us.

22:10.040 --> 22:11.485
Yay! Thanks, Brad.

22:11.600 --> 22:12.886
I don't hate you anymore.

22:14.040 --> 22:15.087
He's going potty!

22:15.360 --> 22:16.700
SARA: Oh, my God.

22:16.800 --> 22:18.450
We'll clean it up. We don't mind.

22:18.720 --> 22:19.820
Look at that.

22:19.920 --> 22:21.380
The dog's already
teaching them responsibility.

22:21.480 --> 22:23.500
Hey, guys, when you got to
pick up the potty, use gloves.

22:23.600 --> 22:25.728
- He's definitely got worms in his poo.
- (BOTH GROANING IN DISGUST)

22:31.680 --> 22:32.761
(SIGHS)

22:33.920 --> 22:36.127
SARA: Dusty!
Can you please move this thing?

22:36.240 --> 22:37.780
I can't get my car out of the garage.

22:37.880 --> 22:39.900
Hey, Brad, do you mind?
I want to grab a quick shower.

22:40.000 --> 22:42.048
Yeah, sure, no problem.

22:43.240 --> 22:44.366
- Hey, honey.
- Hi, sweetie.

22:44.480 --> 22:45.500
It's blocking everything.

22:45.600 --> 22:48.020
No, I know. I know, don't worry.
We're on top of it.

22:48.120 --> 22:50.441
What are you doing? Brad, I don't...

22:51.120 --> 22:53.327
Hey! Stay away from that, please.

22:53.920 --> 22:54.900
(GRUNTS)

22:55.000 --> 22:56.081
Honey, what are you doing?

22:56.200 --> 22:57.486
- (ENGINE REVVING)
- (LAUGHING NERVOUSLY)

22:57.960 --> 22:59.962
I don't know if that's a good idea, Brad.

23:00.080 --> 23:01.127
Dusty!

23:01.280 --> 23:03.965
It's vibrating up into my shoulders.

23:04.920 --> 23:06.922
Hey, it's okay, Brad.
Look, she's a lot of bike, man.

23:07.120 --> 23:08.900
No, I'm good. Why don't you go
back in and take that shower,

23:09.000 --> 23:10.331
so you can get a shirt on?

23:10.600 --> 23:12.260
Oh, you got it.
Hey, you look good on that, man.

23:12.360 --> 23:13.540
Remember, one down, four up.

23:13.640 --> 23:15.449
Dusty, everyone knows it's one down...

23:15.600 --> 23:16.931
- (SCREAMING)
- (TIRES SQUEALING)

23:17.280 --> 23:18.884
Watch out! Watch out! Watch out!

23:19.000 --> 23:20.331
(ALL SCREAMING)

23:21.000 --> 23:22.331
(CRASHING)

23:33.160 --> 23:34.740
Did Brad just die?

23:34.840 --> 23:38.322
I think we all need to prepare ourselves
for that possibility, pumpkin. Okay?

23:39.640 --> 23:40.641
Brad!

23:42.680 --> 23:43.681
Brad!

23:46.520 --> 23:48.020
- (BRAD GROANING)
- (GASPING)

23:48.120 --> 23:49.900
Oh, my God.

23:50.000 --> 23:51.081
- (COUGHING)
- Brad, are you all right?

23:51.200 --> 23:54.780
No, I'm not all right.
I'm in the wall. I'm scared.

23:54.880 --> 23:56.086
Oh, honey.

23:56.200 --> 23:58.043
Jeez, Brad, I thought you said
you could ride.

23:58.240 --> 24:00.300
I can ride, okay.
Would you get a shirt on?

24:00.400 --> 24:03.380
I think if you could ride, you wouldn't
be stuck in a wall right now, Brad.

24:03.480 --> 24:05.540
SARA:
Yeah. I'm sorry to say it, but he's right.

24:05.640 --> 24:06.766
You almost killed the kids!

24:06.880 --> 24:08.460
DUSTY: Let's not beat up
on Brad here. Okay?

24:08.560 --> 24:10.940
He was showboating for the kids
a little bit, and things got out of hand.

24:11.040 --> 24:13.202
Let's all just be grateful
nobody got hurt. Okay?

24:13.480 --> 24:14.561
I got hurt!

24:14.680 --> 24:16.364
Okay, kids, listen up.
This is a good lesson

24:16.480 --> 24:19.211
on why you never wanna lie
about your ability to do things

24:19.320 --> 24:21.368
you clearly can't do, okay, huh?

24:21.840 --> 24:23.620
I think my arm is stuck in the wall.

24:23.720 --> 24:25.100
DUSTY: Brad, just stay still.
I'll get you out.

24:25.200 --> 24:27.202
No, no, no, no, no. No, don't do anything.

24:27.360 --> 24:29.620
And would you please
just go and get a shirt on?

24:29.720 --> 24:31.404
Just calm down, all right?

24:32.720 --> 24:34.370
- (SARA SCREAMING)
- (GROANING)

24:37.040 --> 24:39.202
Hey, I'm really sorry about
what happened to your car.

24:39.400 --> 24:41.340
Yeah, and I'm sorry about
what happened to your bike.

24:41.440 --> 24:43.442
Oh, no damage. Not a scratch.

24:43.720 --> 24:45.563
- Oh, not even one scratch?
- Unbelievable.

24:45.960 --> 24:47.405
(LAUGHS) That's so good.

24:48.160 --> 24:49.685
(ROOF THUDS)

24:53.880 --> 24:55.780
Let's keep it going! Inside the cones!

24:55.880 --> 24:57.370
Just like ice cream!

24:57.600 --> 24:58.780
Morning, Jerry.

24:58.880 --> 25:00.940
Got to keep it inside the cones!

25:01.040 --> 25:03.700
No, Daddy! You're supposed
to stay in the cones!

25:03.800 --> 25:06.041
Whoa, whoa! Inside the cones!

25:06.280 --> 25:07.900
- Inside. Bring her in. That's better.
- (SIGHS)

25:08.000 --> 25:10.660
Let's keep those kids safe today, okay?
Thank you, Brad.

25:10.760 --> 25:12.091
Sorry, Doris.

25:14.280 --> 25:16.660
It's okay. This whole drop-off line thing

25:16.760 --> 25:18.180
can be a bit overwhelming
if you're not used to it.

25:18.280 --> 25:20.580
Yeah, well, I've landed a chopper
in the middle of a Cuban prison riot,

25:20.680 --> 25:22.340
Brad, I think I'm good.

25:22.440 --> 25:23.441
(BEEPING)

25:23.600 --> 25:27.180
Bye, guys! I love you guys so much.
Have a great day, okay?

25:27.280 --> 25:28.964
- Bye, Daddy!
- Make sure you do all your work.

25:29.080 --> 25:30.445
Bye, guys. Have the best day.
I love you so...

25:33.960 --> 25:35.180
BRAD: Here's the exciting thing.

25:35.280 --> 25:39.300
We just opened up in our 68th market,
making The Panda America's

25:39.400 --> 25:41.607
number three smooth jazz station.

25:41.960 --> 25:43.121
Wow.

25:43.960 --> 25:47.282
And here it is. My, uh... My little nook.

25:48.120 --> 25:51.966
Wow. Oh, man, I gotta admit,
this is more than I expected.

25:52.320 --> 25:53.481
Wow.

25:54.640 --> 25:55.860
I kind of envy you, Brad.

25:55.960 --> 25:57.121
Oh, stop it.

25:57.400 --> 26:00.900
Ah, it's true. I mean, you're a nice guy,
making a comfortable living,

26:01.000 --> 26:03.180
and the most fantastic woman
in the world loves you dearly.

26:03.280 --> 26:04.725
Really? Thanks for saying that.

26:04.840 --> 26:09.164
I mean it. And that sacrifice
she's making for you... That's true love.

26:09.360 --> 26:10.361
Sacrifice?

26:10.520 --> 26:11.540
Well, sure, Brad.

26:11.640 --> 26:13.210
You know how bad
that girl wants another baby.

26:14.840 --> 26:16.260
She wants another baby?

26:16.360 --> 26:17.740
For her to let that slip away

26:17.840 --> 26:20.730
and marry a man she knew to be barren,
that's true love.

26:21.720 --> 26:23.484
How do you know that I can't...

26:23.600 --> 26:24.740
- Bradley.
- Yes.

26:24.840 --> 26:26.900
Caroline says we're gonna hear some
new voice talent this a.m.?

26:27.000 --> 26:28.820
Yes, sir, in about 15 minutes.

26:28.920 --> 26:29.980
Okay. How'd it go

26:30.080 --> 26:32.620
- with the shitbag ex-husband?
- Uh-uh.

26:32.720 --> 26:35.451
You whip his ass with
that Loving Fence of yours?

26:35.680 --> 26:37.940
(LAUGHS)
Well, actually it's interesting, Mr. Holt,

26:38.040 --> 26:40.691
because I want you to meet Dusty Mayron.

26:41.120 --> 26:44.886
Jesus in the morning.
She was married to him first?

26:45.640 --> 26:48.020
Okay. Let's establish some
ground rules, pretty boy.

26:48.120 --> 26:49.246
- Airborne?
- Huh?

26:49.360 --> 26:51.980
Well, your lapel pin.
101st, that's one hell of a division, sir.

26:52.080 --> 26:54.481
Oh, well, thank you, Dusty.

26:54.680 --> 26:55.681
Are you Airborne?

26:55.800 --> 26:57.540
Oh, no, sir, I'm afraid
I don't share that honor,

26:57.640 --> 26:59.900
but I'm humbled to be in the
presence of anyone who does.

27:00.000 --> 27:02.526
Airborne Division? Those guys love to fly.

27:03.600 --> 27:04.820
Very nice to meet you, sir.

27:04.920 --> 27:06.900
Thank you, thank you.
It's good to meet you.

27:07.000 --> 27:08.020
My pleasure. It's an honor.

27:08.120 --> 27:09.884
Fast friends over there. (CHUCKLES)

27:10.560 --> 27:11.891
That's wonderful.

27:12.160 --> 27:13.366
Come on! No way!

27:13.720 --> 27:15.860
The whole time you're running guns
for the freedom fighters

27:15.960 --> 27:19.529
right under the cartel's noses,
and they never suspected it was you once?

27:19.680 --> 27:22.220
Well, I'm sure they started to suspect
once they were in a ball of fire

27:22.320 --> 27:23.820
the size of four city blocks.

27:23.920 --> 27:24.921
(LAUGHING)

27:25.520 --> 27:27.460
That's great. I love that!

27:27.560 --> 27:29.020
Holy buckets, Brad!

27:29.120 --> 27:31.620
If this guy was my wife's ex,
I'd put a bullet in my skull.

27:31.720 --> 27:32.940
(BOTH LAUGH)

27:33.040 --> 27:34.300
DUSTY: Come on, Leo, cut it out.

27:34.400 --> 27:36.940
Oh, uh... Sir, I think Barry's ready.

27:37.040 --> 27:38.300
You're really going to like this guy.

27:38.400 --> 27:40.641
Okay. Ready to listen.

27:51.080 --> 27:52.650
All right. Mmm-hmm.

27:54.040 --> 27:55.451
- You like him, Brad?
- I do.

27:55.760 --> 28:00.084
I do. I mean, I think his voice
has a warm dependability

28:00.440 --> 28:03.091
that all Panda listeners could trust.

28:03.760 --> 28:04.780
What do you think, Duster?

28:04.880 --> 28:06.060
(BRAD LAUGHS)

28:06.160 --> 28:07.969
Does Dusty now work for The Panda?

28:08.080 --> 28:09.820
Yeah, Brad's right.

28:09.920 --> 28:12.048
I'm not really into smooth jazz.
I shouldn't comment.

28:12.160 --> 28:14.322
(SCOFFS) Nobody's into smooth jazz.

28:14.440 --> 28:15.646
I'm into smooth jazz.

28:15.760 --> 28:16.921
Of course you are, Brad.

28:17.400 --> 28:18.606
So what do you think, Dusty?

28:18.920 --> 28:20.500
I mean, it just seems a little flaccid.

28:20.600 --> 28:23.700
I think you need a voice with some
virility and hope, that tells listeners,

28:23.800 --> 28:26.963
"Hey! Maybe the next song
won't suck as bad as the last one."

28:27.240 --> 28:29.220
Also, I think a strong ability
to be something like...

28:29.320 --> 28:32.260
(SINGING) One-oh-three-point-six

28:32.360 --> 28:34.727
The Panda!

28:38.000 --> 28:39.001
What...

28:39.480 --> 28:41.482
What just happened?

28:42.480 --> 28:44.801
He sang the tagline.

28:45.200 --> 28:46.725
- Good boy, Tumor!

28:50.960 --> 28:52.485
Oh, perfect timing. Listen to this.

28:52.680 --> 28:54.420
DUSTY ON RADIO: One-oh-three-point-six

28:54.520 --> 28:56.568
The Panda!

28:56.800 --> 28:58.020
- Is that you?
- Yeah!

28:58.120 --> 28:59.326
SARA: That's you?

29:00.160 --> 29:01.810
Why is that him?

29:02.000 --> 29:05.380
I took him to work, and 15 minutes later
he's the new voice of The Panda.

29:05.480 --> 29:08.484
Hey, you believe that? I record
one take at 9:30 this morning,

29:08.640 --> 29:09.971
it's already run 11 times.

29:10.080 --> 29:12.060
Do I really get 182 bucks
every time they play that?

29:12.160 --> 29:13.400
Yes. Every time, yes.

29:13.520 --> 29:14.740
Ooh! Money.

29:14.840 --> 29:17.446
You see why I love America
even more than most people do?

29:18.000 --> 29:19.340
Hey. What's this?

29:19.440 --> 29:21.100
Just the handyman
I hired off Angie's List.

29:21.200 --> 29:23.009
He's upstairs fixing the damage.

29:23.640 --> 29:25.580
Your wife had to hire a man? For what?

29:25.680 --> 29:28.526
Some framing, a little sheetrock repair,
some masonry and basic window glazing?

29:28.640 --> 29:30.369
Come on, Brad.
We can bang that out tonight.

29:32.640 --> 29:33.687
Yeah.

29:33.840 --> 29:35.980
It's just basic sheetrock glazing

29:36.080 --> 29:38.686
and, you know, little whatamajigs.

29:39.040 --> 29:40.690
Get up there and

29:41.880 --> 29:43.689
get in there and crank it out.

29:43.960 --> 29:45.180
Dusty is pretty good with his hands.

29:45.280 --> 29:46.884
Pretty good with my hands,
Brad, she knows.

29:48.520 --> 29:50.780
Okay. Yeah, I'll just go
up there and I'll...

29:50.880 --> 29:52.860
- Want me to do it? I'll tell him to screw.
- No, no, no, no.

29:52.960 --> 29:54.100
No, no, no. That's okay.

29:54.200 --> 29:55.260
I'll tell him,

29:55.360 --> 29:56.805
- "Guess what, bub?"
- Tell him the men are here.

29:56.920 --> 29:58.081
I'll say that.
I'll say, "The men are here."

29:58.200 --> 29:59.884
- Let's do it.
- I don't want to imply to him

30:00.000 --> 30:01.889
that he's not a man. But I'll just say,

30:02.160 --> 30:04.162
"Hey, the boys are back in town." Right?

30:04.600 --> 30:06.125
(HAMMERING)

30:09.880 --> 30:10.881
Oh, hi.

30:12.560 --> 30:14.740
I'm Brad. Uh... My wife hired you.

30:14.840 --> 30:15.980
Nice to meet you, Brad.

30:16.080 --> 30:19.402
I just came up here to say that you...

30:21.080 --> 30:23.731
That, um, you should have good luck.

30:24.400 --> 30:26.243
Thank you for your wishes of luck.

30:26.520 --> 30:27.726
I'll be downstairs.

30:29.520 --> 30:30.931
Well? What happened?

30:31.280 --> 30:32.860
Oh, you know, I think it's...

30:32.960 --> 30:36.300
He already started,
and I just think it feels wrong.

30:36.400 --> 30:37.606
Why? Because he's black?

30:37.760 --> 30:39.091
No. No, no.

30:39.440 --> 30:40.771
Megan! Dylan!

30:40.880 --> 30:42.484
- What are you doing? Huh?
- Teaching moment.

30:43.360 --> 30:46.500
Guys, what would we call Brad
if he treated someone differently

30:46.600 --> 30:48.380
just because of the color of their skin?

30:48.480 --> 30:50.900
- (BOTH GASP)
- Brad's being racism?

30:51.000 --> 30:53.060
Racist, honey. Brad is a racist.

30:53.160 --> 30:54.924
- Honey.
- No, I mean... But not on purpose.

30:55.040 --> 30:56.371
Is Brad a Klan person?

30:56.600 --> 30:58.620
No. (LAUGHS)

30:58.720 --> 31:01.420
So I'm a racist if I don't fire someone?

31:01.520 --> 31:02.500
Well, yeah, you are.

31:02.600 --> 31:03.681
Yeah, you are.

31:05.880 --> 31:08.451
Sir, you're taking this all wrong.

31:08.560 --> 31:10.300
Right. So you get one look
at the color of my skin,

31:10.400 --> 31:12.180
and all of a sudden you're
Mr. Do It Yourself, huh?

31:12.280 --> 31:15.380
No, not at all. Please, allow me
to pay you for your time and travel.

31:15.480 --> 31:17.926
Don't do me any favors, Paula Deen.

31:19.760 --> 31:20.780
I'm not a woman.

31:20.880 --> 31:22.291
You did the right thing.

31:22.400 --> 31:24.209
Boy, it doesn't feel that way.

31:24.360 --> 31:25.620
Let's get cracking.
Where do you keep your tools?

31:25.720 --> 31:28.041
I know where Brad keeps his tools.
In the credenza.

31:28.960 --> 31:29.980
- Yeah.
- You keep your tools

31:30.080 --> 31:31.540
- in the credenza, Brad?
- In the credenza. Mmm-hmm.

31:31.640 --> 31:32.820
Just easier to get to.

31:32.920 --> 31:34.220
- It's convenient.
- Yeah.

31:34.320 --> 31:35.321
(CLATTERING)

31:36.720 --> 31:38.300
This is a tackle box, Brad.
Are we going fishing?

31:38.400 --> 31:40.402
No. Unless you want to go fishing.

31:40.640 --> 31:42.540
What have you got in here?

31:42.640 --> 31:46.001
A hammer, masking tape,
three C batteries and a tampon.

31:46.120 --> 31:47.100
Yeah, well, a tampon's handy for...

31:47.200 --> 31:48.929
Yeah, I know what they're handy for.

31:49.760 --> 31:51.060
So are we not going to fix it?

31:51.160 --> 31:52.340
Well, what do you want from me, Brad?

31:52.440 --> 31:53.620
To buy all the gear we need
would cost more

31:53.720 --> 31:56.007
than just hiring someone
off of Angie's List.

31:59.840 --> 32:01.365
- (GROWLING)
- (GASPS)

32:02.680 --> 32:06.860
And the King, he thought the Step King
seemed okay at first, a little soft, maybe,

32:06.960 --> 32:09.088
but, heck, the Queen needed a meal ticket.

32:09.360 --> 32:10.820
But the more the King learned about him,

32:10.920 --> 32:13.002
the more he doubted the
Step King's ability to lead.

32:13.280 --> 32:15.900
So the King decided
there was only one way to...

32:16.000 --> 32:17.340
Psst... Hey. Good story?

32:17.440 --> 32:19.602
Yeah. The King finally
came back to his castle.

32:19.720 --> 32:22.740
But the evil Step King
wouldn't give him his crown back.

32:22.840 --> 32:26.340
Oh, okay, yeah.
I think I've heard this story before.

32:26.440 --> 32:28.044
Ah, it's a story as old as time, Brad.

32:28.160 --> 32:30.811
Well, you know what? It turns out
the Step King wasn't evil at all.

32:31.040 --> 32:32.140
He was a really good guy.

32:32.240 --> 32:36.340
Fun at parties, great conversationalist,
affable. And he saw

32:36.440 --> 32:39.380
that the beautiful Queen
and perfect Prince and Princess

32:39.480 --> 32:42.802
were all alone, and he came
valiantly to their rescue.

32:42.960 --> 32:44.820
Yeah, but wasn't the Queen sad because

32:44.920 --> 32:47.020
the Step King couldn't give
her an heir to the throne?

32:47.120 --> 32:48.500
Okay, you know what?
Now this is getting personal.

32:48.600 --> 32:51.490
Hey, Brad, come on.
We're just doing fairy tales here.

32:52.480 --> 32:56.900
All right. Well, the Queen wasn't sad,
just for the record. (STUTTERING)

32:57.000 --> 32:59.580
The Step King was pretty sure
she was totally cool with it.

32:59.680 --> 33:02.251
Yeah, Brad's right.
I'm sure the Queen was thrilled. Right?

33:02.720 --> 33:03.881
Right?

33:04.480 --> 33:05.561
Yeah.

33:11.160 --> 33:12.321
Honey,

33:13.560 --> 33:15.164
what's the matter?

33:15.920 --> 33:17.860
Are you still sad about
Dusty finding your tampon?

33:17.960 --> 33:20.042
No. No, I mean,

33:21.000 --> 33:24.849
this is a little embarrassing,
but it's just, I was...

33:26.680 --> 33:29.684
Is there any chance
you still want another baby?

33:30.360 --> 33:33.682
Oh, my God. What, did Dusty say something?

33:34.680 --> 33:36.682
He's just trying to get in your head.

33:36.920 --> 33:38.285
So it's not true then?

33:42.840 --> 33:45.525
Okay. Maybe I did want another baby.

33:46.280 --> 33:48.420
But it's not possible,
given what happened to your...

33:48.520 --> 33:51.410
And I'm not blaming them. I love them.

33:51.640 --> 33:53.180
They are my fuzzy little pals.

33:53.280 --> 33:54.406
You don't have to say that.

33:54.600 --> 33:55.726
They are.

33:56.280 --> 33:59.124
I am 100% happy
with the family that I have.

33:59.960 --> 34:03.700
The only reason I'm putting up with him is
because my kids are so happy to see him.

34:03.800 --> 34:05.962
And I want them to have
a relationship with their father.

34:07.720 --> 34:08.880
You know what?

34:09.000 --> 34:10.420
I can't wait to see his face

34:10.520 --> 34:13.330
when he figures out
how much you really do for his kids.

34:14.040 --> 34:16.407
Yeah. I mean, I'm

34:17.400 --> 34:19.940
involved. I'm emotionally available.

34:20.040 --> 34:21.139
Yeah, you are.

34:21.239 --> 34:22.889
You are darn right.

34:23.400 --> 34:27.085
It's high time Dusty sees
how a real dad does it.

34:27.400 --> 34:29.083

He's a great dude, man. He really is.

36:30.760 --> 36:33.001
I know how you feel about him,
but just give him a chance.

36:33.120 --> 36:35.060
All right? He's having
a tough time at home,

36:35.160 --> 36:36.924
and your firing him sure didn't help.

36:37.120 --> 36:38.540
Well, I fired him because you made me!

36:38.640 --> 36:39.721
- I made you?
- Yeah.

Am I in charge around here now?
Is my name on the mortgage?

36:42.080 --> 36:43.500
Last time I checked,
you were the man of the house,

36:43.600 --> 36:45.140
and me and Griffy were just staying here.

36:45.240 --> 36:46.969
- He's not staying here.
- Because he's black?

36:47.160 --> 36:48.340
No, not because of that.

And what's the first thing we do? Anybody?

39:10.880 --> 39:12.564
- You! Redhead.
- Call 911.

39:12.760 --> 39:16.060
Close. But wrong.
First thing we do is remain calm.

39:16.160 --> 39:17.180
Yeah, that's good advice.

39:17.280 --> 39:19.660
The 911 operator can't understand you
if you're hysterical, okay?

39:19.760 --> 39:21.808
So let's all take a deep breath.
In for ten...

39:21.920 --> 39:23.980
Are you kidding me right now? Help him!

39:24.080 --> 39:25.940
Hey, that doesn't sound calm, Sara.

39:26.040 --> 39:27.900
Now, please, call 911
and relate to the dispatcher

39:28.000 --> 39:29.820
- what happened calmly, okay?
- Okay, yes.

39:29.920 --> 39:31.700
Anybody know what we do next?

39:31.800 --> 39:33.020
Check for pulse!

39:33.120 --> 39:35.020
Nice! My star pupil! Come on up here.

39:35.120 --> 39:38.660
All right! Okay, two fingers on the neck,
right below the ear.

39:38.760 --> 39:40.683
- Good. You feel a heartbeat?
- Uh-uh.

39:41.120 --> 39:44.806
Okay, now that means that
Brad here is now clinically... Anybody?

39:45.000 --> 39:46.365
- You, Jean Jacket!
- Dead?

39:46.520 --> 39:47.860
Attaboy, Jean Jacket. You're a smart kid.

39:47.960 --> 39:48.980
He is dead.

39:49.080 --> 39:51.660
All right, so what do we do?
Come on, we're losing him here.

39:51.760 --> 39:53.330
Give him C.P.R.?

39:53.600 --> 39:55.921
Yes! That's my girl.
Come on up here, sweetie.

39:56.160 --> 39:59.801
All right! All right, lock your fingers like
this and press down hard right here.

40:00.120 --> 40:01.645
- (GRUNTING)
- Oh, great job, sweetheart.

40:01.800 --> 40:02.740
Dusty, hurry!

40:02.840 --> 40:04.569
Okay, I'm going to go ahead
and take this one.

40:04.760 --> 40:06.000
Okay? Watch closely now.

40:06.120 --> 40:07.940
If you do your
chest compressions properly,

40:08.040 --> 40:10.327
it shouldn't take long. Clear out, guys.

40:10.480 --> 40:11.811
(WHIRRING)

40:13.160 --> 40:14.380
(GASPING)

40:14.480 --> 40:15.940
- I got him! I got him!
- (COUGHING)

40:16.040 --> 40:17.405
(ALL CHEERING)

40:18.840 --> 40:21.411
My dad can bring people
back from the dead!

40:21.520 --> 40:22.681
(GROANING)

40:22.840 --> 40:24.888
Mr. Whitaker's a zombie!

40:25.000 --> 40:26.604
(MUTTERING)

40:28.520 --> 40:32.340
Look, I'm okay, really.
I just got a little jolt.

40:32.440 --> 40:34.841
You got a little killed
is what you got, Brad.

40:35.200 --> 40:36.850
We thought we lost you.

40:37.200 --> 40:38.565
Okay, I'm sorry.

40:38.680 --> 40:40.682
I just got tired of being
the lame stepdad.

40:40.800 --> 40:42.643
All the kids think he's Superman.

40:42.840 --> 40:44.524
Well, now you know how I felt.

40:44.840 --> 40:46.420
I always had to be the bad guy mom,

40:46.520 --> 40:49.046
giving out the carrots
and the punishments,

40:49.320 --> 40:51.891
and he would breeze in
from God only knows where

40:52.000 --> 40:53.940
and get to be the cool, fun dad.

40:54.040 --> 40:56.008
Honey. Look. (SIGHS)

40:56.360 --> 40:57.820
I'll talk to him, okay?

40:57.920 --> 41:01.407
I'll tell him to get his stuff
and get over to the Red Roof Inn. Pronto.

41:01.880 --> 41:02.881
Great.

41:03.720 --> 41:05.131
(TV PLAYING)

41:06.400 --> 41:09.404
Wait. Prince Hans is actually the bad guy?

41:09.680 --> 41:11.100
Man, I didn't see that coming at all.

41:11.200 --> 41:12.565
He seemed like he really loved Anna.

41:13.040 --> 41:14.121
MEGAN: I hate Prince Hans.

41:14.240 --> 41:15.446
Dusty.

41:15.680 --> 41:17.489
- Hey, how you feeling, Sparky?
- (CHUCKLES)

41:18.000 --> 41:19.660
Sparky. That's hilarious.

41:19.760 --> 41:20.966
DUSTY: Brad, have you seen this movie?

41:21.080 --> 41:22.300
It's unbelievable, man.

41:22.400 --> 41:24.448
There's these two sisters,
one of them has ice powers.

41:24.560 --> 41:26.449
Yeah, I'm familiar with Frozen.

41:27.360 --> 41:29.060
Listen, Dusty, I need to talk to you now.

41:29.160 --> 41:30.180
I can't talk now, Brad.

41:30.280 --> 41:31.380
Just pause the movie!

41:31.480 --> 41:32.820
Can you guys talk out there, please?

41:32.920 --> 41:34.081
Griff, man. You gotta pause it, man.

41:34.240 --> 41:35.460
No! I don't want to ruin the momentum.

41:35.560 --> 41:38.740
He won't... Dude, if another song
comes on, you got to pause it. Okay?

41:38.840 --> 41:40.220
Am I supposed to pause my emotions?

41:40.320 --> 41:41.810
Just pause the song, man.

41:42.200 --> 41:43.980
What's up? What's up?
What's going on, Brad?

41:44.080 --> 41:45.445
- This shouldn't take long.
- Okay, good.

41:45.880 --> 41:47.980
Listen, um, I just think
that you're being here...

41:48.080 --> 41:49.940
Yeah. No problem.

41:50.040 --> 41:53.045
...and now there's Griff here,
it's presenting some obstacles...

41:53.160 --> 41:54.286
(SOBBING)

41:55.320 --> 41:56.526
Stupid helmet!

41:56.760 --> 41:57.860
Honey, what happened?

41:57.960 --> 41:59.300
They pushed me off my bike again!

41:59.400 --> 42:00.811
- I'm so sick of it!
- (CLATTERING)

42:06.280 --> 42:08.900
I want them dead, Brad. All right?
I want their parents dead.

42:09.000 --> 42:10.180
And if they don't have parents, I want

42:10.280 --> 42:12.180
their primary caregivers dead.
Do you understand me?

42:12.280 --> 42:13.340
- Okay, okay.
- He's okay.

42:13.440 --> 42:16.060
Megan's upstairs playing with him.
I am so pissed about this.

42:16.160 --> 42:17.260
Was it the fourth graders again?

42:17.360 --> 42:19.660
Fourth graders?
What, you knew about this, Brad?

42:19.760 --> 42:22.286
Yeah. Dylan asked to speak
specifically to me about it.

42:22.400 --> 42:23.740
- Really?
- So, we role-played

42:23.840 --> 42:25.260
some conflict resolution dialogue.

42:25.360 --> 42:26.860
Are you being serious right now, Brad?

42:26.960 --> 42:29.380
What you need to be teaching him
is some ass-beating resolution.

42:29.480 --> 42:32.780
Damn straight. You got to
make a statement. Set a tone.

42:32.880 --> 42:35.060
It's kind of a family matter over here.

42:35.160 --> 42:36.650
No, Dusty and Griff are right.

42:36.800 --> 42:38.460
Those little punks need
their butts whooped.

42:38.560 --> 42:39.860
Hey, you got any Miracle Whip?

42:39.960 --> 42:41.007
Yeah, it's behind the... (SIGHS)

42:41.360 --> 42:43.681
Here. Hold on. Let me just get it for you.

42:44.480 --> 42:47.484
Guys, I know we're upset right now,

42:47.840 --> 42:49.569
but here's the thing.

42:50.120 --> 42:51.770
Violence never solved anything.

42:51.920 --> 42:52.940
Hey, check your history books, buddy.

42:53.040 --> 42:54.340
Almost everything is solved by violence.

42:54.440 --> 42:55.805
There are better ways.

42:55.920 --> 42:58.491
Okay. Name one. Besides dialoguing.

42:58.600 --> 43:00.170
- Name one?
- Name one!

43:00.480 --> 43:02.220
- What do you mean, name one?
- You said you could

43:02.320 --> 43:03.620
solve problems with
things other than fighting.

43:03.720 --> 43:04.780
- What are you gonna do?
- I don't know.

43:04.880 --> 43:07.100
Well, you said you knew!
You act like you knew!

43:07.200 --> 43:08.260
- Fine, yes!
- What?

43:08.360 --> 43:10.044
Dancing! Dancing.

43:13.040 --> 43:15.340
Did you... Did you just say dancing, Brad?

43:15.440 --> 43:19.206
It's very popular in youth culture
to resolve conflict through dancing.

43:19.400 --> 43:21.687
They step up to each other and get served

43:21.840 --> 43:24.180
by crunking, or popping and locking.

43:24.280 --> 43:26.521
They call each other out, they take turns,

43:26.680 --> 43:30.401
and it is no less intense
than a classic street brawl.

43:30.680 --> 43:33.729
But, at the end of the day, no one's hurt.

43:34.080 --> 43:36.401
And it's a great aerobic workout.

43:36.880 --> 43:39.770
He's flailing a bit,
but he has a good point.

43:39.880 --> 43:42.087
There's a rich history
of dance battles in film.

43:42.400 --> 43:44.340
- You got Breakin' 1...
- I didn't even think of this.

43:44.440 --> 43:46.442
...Breakin' 2: Electric Boogaloo.

43:46.560 --> 43:48.260
One of the rare cases
where the sequel was better

43:48.360 --> 43:49.620
- than the original.
- Much better.

43:49.720 --> 43:51.540
You got Step Up, Stomp the Yard.

43:51.640 --> 43:53.210
He makes a solid point.

43:53.600 --> 43:56.140
Honey, are you telling us that we
should teach Dylan to dance?

43:56.240 --> 44:00.420
(SIGHS) No, I'm just saying that
teaching him to fight isn't the answer.

44:00.520 --> 44:03.922
Okay, but maybe teaching him
to fight back isn't so bad?

44:05.920 --> 44:07.206
BRAD: Okay.

44:08.280 --> 44:12.126
There we go. Perfect.
That's good, right there.

44:13.120 --> 44:14.724
Yeah. A lot of protection.

44:19.600 --> 44:20.820
All right, Dylan. You ready, buddy?

44:20.920 --> 44:22.260
- I guess.
- Oh, you're ready.

44:22.360 --> 44:24.460
Brad, Griff. You guys be
the fourth graders.

44:24.560 --> 44:26.164
- I'll be Dylan.
- Okay.

44:26.360 --> 44:30.524
All right. Hey, buddy, the first thing you
want to do is call out the biggest one.

44:30.840 --> 44:32.524
Hey! What's the matter?

44:32.720 --> 44:35.524
You too much of a pussy to take me on
without your little bitches to back you up?

44:36.120 --> 44:39.681
Wow. Okay, yes.
That cut right through me, there.

44:39.800 --> 44:41.802
I'm filled with inner shame right now.

44:42.080 --> 44:44.300
Saying to myself,
"Gosh, maybe I'm not behaving

44:44.400 --> 44:47.460
"100% the way I want to."
Right? Is that same page?

44:47.560 --> 44:49.820
No. What the kid's gonna think
is, "Now I can beat your ass

44:49.920 --> 44:52.605
"all on my own." But now
you only got one bully to contend with.

44:52.760 --> 44:54.420
Now bullies always open up
with some shoving first.

44:54.520 --> 44:56.340
- Watch. Brad, give me a little shove.
- All right.

44:56.440 --> 44:57.420
(YELPS)

44:57.520 --> 44:58.681
Whoa, I didn't connect there, did I?

44:58.800 --> 45:00.450
No. It was really close, though.

45:00.960 --> 45:03.380
See what I did, buddy?
I turned my body just enough

45:03.480 --> 45:05.980
to let his weight bring him in,
then I came right down Broadway.

45:06.080 --> 45:07.620
- I'm not gonna hit you.
- Oh.

45:07.720 --> 45:10.060
- Okay, relax. Okay?
- Mmm-hmm.

45:10.160 --> 45:11.180
- Bam!
- (ALL GASP)

45:11.280 --> 45:12.486
It's called the element of surprise.

45:12.600 --> 45:13.965
Then you start punking his ass!

45:14.080 --> 45:16.162
You want some more of that, bitch, huh?
You like that, bitch?

45:16.280 --> 45:17.980
All right. Do we really
need to use that word?

45:18.080 --> 45:19.206
- No.
- Honey, yes.

45:19.320 --> 45:20.820
Unfortunately, we do. I'm sorry.

45:20.920 --> 45:22.763
You have to make him a bitch.

45:22.880 --> 45:24.848
It's a fundamental step in
destroying a bully's psyche.

45:25.000 --> 45:26.300
Now stay down, bitch!

45:26.400 --> 45:27.860
Then you kick that kid right in the nuts!

45:27.960 --> 45:29.007
Kick him in the nuts, Dylan!

45:29.160 --> 45:30.460
Wait! I thought you were in my gang.

45:30.560 --> 45:32.881
Yeah, but once Dylan tuned you up,
I switched sides.

45:33.000 --> 45:34.700
What do you think happens
out there on the playground, Brad?

45:34.800 --> 45:36.564
All right, now come on, buddy.
It's your turn. All right?

45:36.680 --> 45:37.966
I'll be the fourth grader.

45:38.080 --> 45:39.900
Can I just go inside already, please?

45:40.000 --> 45:41.940
Hey, buddy come on, this is easy.
You can do this.

45:42.040 --> 45:43.849
I said, no! I don't like this stuff.

45:43.960 --> 45:46.486
I'll just stay away from them
from now on. Mom?

45:46.600 --> 45:47.780
Okay, come here, buddy.

45:47.880 --> 45:49.041
- Come on. It's all right.
- Brad.

45:49.160 --> 45:50.685
Help me out here. Come on.

45:52.240 --> 45:53.401
Hey, wait.

45:54.240 --> 45:56.049
Pal, listen...

45:56.320 --> 45:58.163
I know what it's like
to be afraid to go to school.

45:58.400 --> 46:00.050
Okay? When I was your age,

46:00.360 --> 46:02.727
this group of older kids
started picking on me.

46:03.680 --> 46:05.740
I ran and I cried
underneath the bleachers.

46:05.840 --> 46:08.844
They bothered me every day,
because they knew

46:09.600 --> 46:10.931
I was too afraid to face them.

46:11.640 --> 46:13.768
Until one day, I'd had enough.

46:14.040 --> 46:16.202
And I socked Jesse Hubbard
right in the nose.

46:16.520 --> 46:18.522
Really? And they left you alone?

46:18.920 --> 46:20.251
Damn right they did.

46:23.880 --> 46:25.882
Brad. (SOFTLY) That was good.

46:26.440 --> 46:30.001
Come here, buddy.
Hey, I'm proud of you. All right?

46:30.200 --> 46:32.700
Now, look at me. I want you to punch them
right in the Adam's apple. Okay?

46:32.800 --> 46:34.660
I want you to shatter their throat.

46:34.760 --> 46:36.250
Hold on, hold on.

46:37.360 --> 46:41.100
I'm sorry. Look, I'm having
a pang of guilt right now.

46:41.200 --> 46:44.411
Full disclosure. Some of the elements
of my story weren't exactly true.

46:45.280 --> 46:47.282
Um, the incessant crying, 100% true.

46:47.560 --> 46:50.723
The constant bullying, absolutely,
it all happened, but I, uh...

46:51.560 --> 46:53.688
I've never punched anyone in my life.

46:53.880 --> 46:55.086
I could have told you that.

46:55.360 --> 46:57.727
- Then what did you do?
- Yeah, what did you do?

46:58.400 --> 47:00.460
Well, nothing at all.
In fact, sixth grade was so rough,

47:00.560 --> 47:04.100
I changed my name to Devin Lacecock.

47:04.200 --> 47:05.884
Why the hell would you tell him that?

47:06.240 --> 47:10.084
I pretended to be blind for an entire
school year, just to elicit empathy.

47:10.560 --> 47:12.244
Which was great until

47:12.520 --> 47:15.763
they found me intently watching
an episode of M*A*S*H.

47:16.240 --> 47:17.940
In fact, it got so bad,
my parents had to refinance

47:18.040 --> 47:19.610
our house to put me in private school.

47:19.880 --> 47:23.089
Let's just do that.
Can I go to private school, please?

47:23.560 --> 47:25.767
No, Dylan, we can't do that.
Want to know why?

47:26.760 --> 47:30.684
Because ever since that day,
I've always run away from conflict.

47:31.280 --> 47:35.922
In fact, if I had a dad like Dusty
when I was your age, maybe

47:36.400 --> 47:38.880
he could have taught me
how to stand up for myself.

47:39.440 --> 47:41.602
So, wait. You're saying,

47:41.720 --> 47:43.961
if I don't stick up for myself now,

47:44.160 --> 47:46.447
I'll grow up to be a huge wussy like you?

47:46.800 --> 47:51.442
Um, yes. That is the basic
gist of what I'm saying. Yes.

47:51.800 --> 47:53.802
Okay. Then let's do this.

47:54.200 --> 47:55.740
DUSTY: Come on, buddy, you got this.

47:55.840 --> 47:56.900
Give me something. Come on.

47:57.000 --> 47:58.740
Faster, harder, meaner, stronger.

47:58.840 --> 48:00.060
You're fast, you're good.

48:00.160 --> 48:01.491
You're a winner. You're a champion.

48:01.640 --> 48:04.564
They got to let you off the leash, baby.
We got a little pit bull here.

48:05.480 --> 48:08.460
That was really nice, you guys. Good job.

48:08.560 --> 48:10.700
It was really fun to watch
the two of you working together

48:10.800 --> 48:13.280
like a couple of great co-dads.

48:13.600 --> 48:14.761
Yeah.

48:15.320 --> 48:17.641
Co-dads. That's...

48:18.320 --> 48:19.446
That's good stuff.

48:19.640 --> 48:22.166
You know what?
In that same spirit of unity,

48:23.120 --> 48:24.531
I want to show my gratitude
for your inviting me

48:24.640 --> 48:26.369
to stay here and share moments like these.

48:26.480 --> 48:28.608
Oh, about that, Dusty.
When I pulled you over there, actually...

48:28.720 --> 48:31.180
No, what you've done here
does not go unnoticed.

48:31.280 --> 48:32.691
And I repay my debts.

48:32.960 --> 48:34.724
Look, Sara, I know how much
you want another child.

48:34.840 --> 48:36.620
I think I can help
put a baby in there for you.

48:36.720 --> 48:38.380
- Oh, my God!
- What are you saying?

48:38.480 --> 48:40.660
- I mean I got a guy.
- Dusty, please! You got a guy?

48:40.760 --> 48:42.620
Yes, I got a guy. A fertility doctor.

48:42.720 --> 48:44.940
He's a buddy of mine.
I trained him for his first Ironman.

48:45.040 --> 48:47.042
All right? Dr. Francisco is the real deal.

48:47.360 --> 48:49.362
- Dr. Emilio Francisco?
- You've heard of him?

48:49.480 --> 48:51.005
Oh, my God, yeah.

48:51.160 --> 48:53.049
He's been on Dr. Oz like 10 times.

48:53.200 --> 48:56.409
Yeah, he's one of the top five reproductive
endocrinologists in the country.

48:56.520 --> 48:59.300
See? People wait years
to get an appointment with this guy.

48:59.400 --> 49:00.700
Do you really think he would see us?

49:00.800 --> 49:02.740
- Whoa, whoa, hold on.
- I know he would.

49:02.840 --> 49:05.411
If anybody can help you
have a baby, he can.

49:05.880 --> 49:07.220
Mommy's going to have a baby?

49:07.320 --> 49:08.580
Cool! Can we name it Griff?

49:08.680 --> 49:09.780
Oh, thanks, D-man.

49:09.880 --> 49:12.042
Look, you guys,
I don't know if this is a good idea.

49:12.200 --> 49:13.940
What, you don't wanna name your baby
after a black person?

49:14.040 --> 49:15.140
- Is that it?
- No!

49:15.240 --> 49:18.529
You probably want to name it something
really white, like Connor or Gordon.

49:19.200 --> 49:22.900
Harland, or Scot with one T. Or Brad.

49:23.000 --> 49:25.651
No, no, Griff is a lovely name.
I'm just saying,

49:26.080 --> 49:28.208
I don't think it's a good
idea to get our hopes up,

49:29.040 --> 49:31.088
because, in the end,

49:31.200 --> 49:33.726
odds are, I'm going to let you down.

49:34.400 --> 49:38.690
Okay, honey, but what if I promise,
promise, promise not to get my hopes up?

49:39.120 --> 49:41.088
We could just try, right? It can't hurt.

49:42.440 --> 49:45.410
Okay, sure.
But you can't get your hopes up.

49:45.560 --> 49:46.700
No. I won't, I won't! Thank you!

49:46.800 --> 49:48.802
I feel like you've already
gotten your hopes up.

49:50.040 --> 49:51.500
- Where are you going?
- Nowhere!

49:51.600 --> 49:53.284
- You calling your mother?
- No!

49:53.480 --> 49:55.482
Okay, yes, but it's about something else.

49:55.800 --> 49:57.211
It's not about something else.

49:57.640 --> 49:59.404
Damn it, Brad, he set you up.

49:59.800 --> 50:03.009
He used this fancy doctor
to get your wife back on the baby train.

50:03.320 --> 50:07.245
When those test results come back
and prove that you can't give her a baby,

50:07.760 --> 50:09.922
guess who's gonna be waiting
there cocked and loaded?

50:10.280 --> 50:14.762
Well, I trust my wife, so we really don't
need to keep talking about it, okay?

50:14.920 --> 50:16.604
Let me tell you a little story, Brad.

50:16.960 --> 50:21.100
When Jeneane, my fourth, and I
were returning from our honeymoon,

50:21.200 --> 50:23.248
she told me that
she had a 23-year-old kid.

50:23.480 --> 50:26.324
Brazilian boy.
Said she had him real young.

50:26.600 --> 50:27.726
So he moves in with us.

50:28.040 --> 50:29.451
Doesn't speak a lick of English.

50:29.640 --> 50:32.849
There are the usual tensions.
I try to assert my authority.

50:33.160 --> 50:35.731
"Andreas, get your feet
off the furniture."

50:35.920 --> 50:38.764
"Andreas, you're too old
to sleep in bed with Mommy."

50:39.160 --> 50:41.811
"Andreas, you got to stay off the 'roids."

50:42.120 --> 50:44.566
And he'd get mad,
and hit me with a car antenna.

50:45.120 --> 50:46.804
Eh... Maybe that's the way kids are.

50:47.000 --> 50:48.460
No. Not really.

50:48.560 --> 50:51.040
So I adopt him,
help him get his citizenship.

50:51.560 --> 50:54.450
The second the papers come through,
guess what happens?

50:54.640 --> 50:55.580
I already know.

50:55.680 --> 50:57.682
Bam! They shack up together in Barstow.

50:57.800 --> 50:59.700
It turns out Andreas

50:59.800 --> 51:01.643
- is her boyfriend, Brad.
- Mmm-hmm.

51:02.000 --> 51:03.684
I did not see it coming.

51:03.800 --> 51:08.140
I actually did, about one,
two words into your story.

51:08.240 --> 51:11.604
The moral of this fable is,
it's good to know when you're beaten.

51:12.160 --> 51:14.686
- You know I think the world of you, Brad.
- Thank you.

51:14.840 --> 51:18.447
But if I'm being completely honest,
even I'm rooting for Dusty.

51:19.040 --> 51:20.565
He's just so damn likeable.

51:21.360 --> 51:24.967
You know, it's getting kind of late.
Shouldn't we just get back to work?

51:25.360 --> 51:26.725
Okay, you win.

51:27.560 --> 51:31.406
So where are we on The Panda Jam
numbers for next summer?

51:32.680 --> 51:35.047
London, you still on the conference call?

51:37.040 --> 51:39.691
Dusty Mayron, you crazy hijo de puta!

51:40.560 --> 51:42.460
- (LAUGHS) Hey, what's up, Doc?
- (EXCLAIMING)

51:42.560 --> 51:45.100
You look great, man. You still
rocking those Ironmans, huh?

51:45.200 --> 51:47.260
Yeah, bro.
I just finished Brazil in 11:40.

51:47.360 --> 51:49.100
- That's unbelievable.
- Yeah. Well, come on.

51:49.200 --> 51:50.406
Ain't nothing on you, man.

51:50.520 --> 51:53.500
Hey, my first race,
I'm limping across the finish line

51:53.600 --> 51:55.011
when this bastard laps me.

51:55.200 --> 51:56.565
I mean, come on, who wins an Ironman,

51:56.680 --> 51:58.580
then decides to go around again?
Who does that?

51:58.680 --> 52:00.205
It sounds exhausting.

52:00.480 --> 52:03.802
Hey, I'm Dr. Francisco. You must be Sara.

52:03.960 --> 52:04.961
Hi. (LAUGHS)

52:05.080 --> 52:08.243
Dusty, you were not lying
about this one. Very nice.

52:08.920 --> 52:10.100
And you weren't lying
about this one either.

52:10.200 --> 52:11.540
You must be Chief Glowing Sack.

52:11.640 --> 52:13.324
What? (LAUGHS)

52:13.440 --> 52:14.780
Hey, come on,
I'm just lighting you up, man.

52:14.880 --> 52:15.927
Come on, little hug.

52:16.040 --> 52:18.884
Okay, come on back, y'all.
Let's take a look.

52:19.880 --> 52:21.405
All right. So let's run it down.

52:21.880 --> 52:25.402
I think we can safely say that your issue
has nothing to do with X-rays.

52:25.600 --> 52:28.180
You know what, sweetheart, come here.
Let's see that pretty little hand.

52:28.280 --> 52:29.930
Okay. Now put it right in here.

52:30.240 --> 52:32.460
- Oh!
- Okay, you feel that?

52:32.560 --> 52:34.380
- Yeah.
- Okay, that is not how you want

52:34.480 --> 52:35.766
testicles to be shaped.

52:35.920 --> 52:38.924
Really? It feels like all the other...

52:39.080 --> 52:40.081
Hi.

52:40.240 --> 52:42.700
Well, it cuts off blood flow, okay?
Limits potency.

52:42.800 --> 52:44.928
You want them to...
You know what? Actually...

52:45.560 --> 52:47.660
- Hey, Dusty!
- Hey.

52:47.760 --> 52:49.922
- Why is he coming in here?
- Little help in here, please.

52:50.120 --> 52:51.660
Oh, come on. You gotta put me
through this every time?

52:51.760 --> 52:53.250
- Come on. Be a sport.
- All right.

52:53.640 --> 52:54.801
Oh, my God! What are you doing?

52:54.920 --> 52:56.445
Is this even ethical?

52:56.800 --> 52:59.121
(GASPS) James and the Giant Peach.

52:59.440 --> 53:00.500
(GULPS)

53:00.600 --> 53:02.762
- Did you just gulp?
- No.

53:03.000 --> 53:04.525
It's okay, I gulp every time.

53:05.000 --> 53:08.527
You see, this... This is what you want.

53:08.840 --> 53:10.285
Plump and bulbous.

53:10.680 --> 53:12.660
Glassy smooth, like

53:12.760 --> 53:15.180
two Patrick Stewarts,
you know what I mean?

53:15.280 --> 53:17.300
Don't embarrass me in front
of Sara like this anymore, okay?

53:17.400 --> 53:18.660
DR. FRANCISCO: Hey, sorry, bro.

53:18.760 --> 53:21.260
So, ready to milk the cow,
see if we even got a sliver of hope here?

53:21.360 --> 53:23.780
Hey, Dusty, come on, buddy. Want to
try to break your own record?

53:23.880 --> 53:24.900
Oh, no, I'm good.

53:25.000 --> 53:26.860
DR. FRANCISCO: Hey, come on, man.
I'm doing you a favor here.

53:26.960 --> 53:29.167
Give me something to brag
about at the next symposium.

53:29.280 --> 53:32.568
All right, fine. You want to break
the record, I gotta break the record.

53:33.080 --> 53:35.082
(LAUGHS) Yeah. Kid came to play.

53:35.560 --> 53:36.820
Should I grab a big cup, too?

53:36.920 --> 53:37.967
What? Stop screwing around.

53:38.120 --> 53:39.645
Come on. We're burning daylight here.

54:08.880 --> 54:12.660
Hello. Quick question.
How difficult would it be

54:12.760 --> 54:15.604
for someone to whip up
a batch of your Cinnabons?

54:15.920 --> 54:17.820
Would you need restaurant-grade ovens?

54:17.920 --> 54:19.922
Bradsky. Could you
pass this along to Dusty?

54:20.040 --> 54:21.405
It's his first resids check.

54:21.520 --> 54:23.260
Disclaimer. It's more than you make.

54:23.360 --> 54:25.010
- Don't get worried about it.
- How much more than...

54:25.120 --> 54:28.044
Oh, and tell him, 8:30 sharp at my house.

54:28.440 --> 54:30.260
He doesn't need to bring anything.
All right, buddy?

54:30.360 --> 54:31.660
I've never been to your house.

54:31.760 --> 54:33.205
No, you haven't.

54:36.520 --> 54:39.888
SARA: Oh, my God, my hair, it looks awful.

54:40.200 --> 54:41.500
Doesn't Mommy's hair look pretty?

54:41.600 --> 54:43.364
- No. Next slide, please.
- DUSTY: Oh, okay.

54:43.680 --> 54:46.286
- Slides. Fun.
- DUSTY: Aw...

54:46.720 --> 54:48.370
Cool. You guys climbed that?

54:48.600 --> 54:51.285
Yuck. Why are you guys kissing
in every single picture?

54:51.520 --> 54:53.568
Oh, Mommy used to kiss Daddy a lot.

54:53.800 --> 54:55.370
SARA: Married people kiss a lot.

54:55.520 --> 54:56.620
DUSTY: Ready?

54:56.720 --> 54:58.051
Wow, China.

54:58.320 --> 54:59.890
I loved it there.

55:00.040 --> 55:02.281
Dylan, you were created right
there on that wall, buddy.

55:02.400 --> 55:04.050
- Really?
- Dusty, that's enough.

55:04.200 --> 55:06.487
- DUSTY: Okay, next slide.
- (SARA LAUGHS)

55:06.640 --> 55:09.644
That's where your mom and I met,
doing The King and I in summer stock.

55:10.240 --> 55:12.891
SARA: God, that costume was so tight.
(LAUGHS)

55:13.400 --> 55:15.243
Next slide, please.

55:15.640 --> 55:17.005
Oh, my God.

55:19.080 --> 55:20.764
- MEGAN: Is that baby me?
- SARA: Mmm-hmm.

55:32.920 --> 55:36.402
All right, you guys, let's,
um, get ready for bed.

55:36.920 --> 55:38.940
- Okay?
- DUSTY: It's story time, Mayron family!

55:39.040 --> 55:39.980
(CHILDREN CHEERING)

55:40.080 --> 55:42.580
MEGAN: We don't have to wait
for Mr. Whitaker, do we?

55:42.680 --> 55:47.004
I really don't like you,
but that shit is heartbreaking.

55:51.280 --> 55:52.340
(DOOR CLOSING)

55:52.440 --> 55:54.442
MEGAN: Yay! Griff's home!

55:54.880 --> 55:58.607
So the King raised his mighty sword
and rained steel down upon the Step King.

55:59.520 --> 56:01.204
But the Step King
blocked it with his shield.

56:02.120 --> 56:04.860
And swung his cat o'nine tails
into the King's smug face.

56:04.960 --> 56:07.580
Which the King easily brushed aside
like the feather of a gull.

56:07.680 --> 56:10.340
And then the King did counter
with a barrage of slashes

56:10.440 --> 56:13.740
and thrusts so fast and precise
that the Step King had no way to parry.

56:13.840 --> 56:14.860
BOTH: Yay!

56:14.960 --> 56:17.340
But he did. He did.
He parried all of them.

56:17.440 --> 56:19.860
- Easily. It was no big deal.
- BOTH: Aw.

56:19.960 --> 56:22.645
Then he grabbed the King's
sword right out of his hand

56:23.200 --> 56:24.964
and smashed it over his knee.

56:25.120 --> 56:26.140
BOTH: Boo!

56:26.240 --> 56:28.820
That's when the King pulled out
a pump-action Mossberg shotgun!

56:28.920 --> 56:30.843
Which is completely anachronistic.

56:31.080 --> 56:34.380
So if we're doing any time period,
then the Step King just happened to be

56:34.480 --> 56:36.323
wearing Kevlar body armor.

56:36.560 --> 56:38.244
- Concussion grenade!
- Hand grenade.

56:38.480 --> 56:39.780
- Rocket launcher.
- Missile launcher.

56:39.880 --> 56:41.060
- Air strike.
- Nuclear strike.

56:41.160 --> 56:42.605
- Black hole.
- God.

56:43.000 --> 56:44.331
We know what this comes down to.

56:44.560 --> 56:47.060
The Step King was very upset

56:47.160 --> 56:49.083
because when the real King
pulled out his sword,

56:49.400 --> 56:51.220
it was long and shiny,

56:51.320 --> 56:53.380
and the Step King
did shudder at the size of it.

56:53.480 --> 56:57.140
And while the Step King acknowledged
that the King carried a mighty,

56:57.240 --> 57:01.260
beautifully engraved broadsword,
all the maidens in the land

it knew how to listen.

57:07.400 --> 57:09.140
- (SCOFFS)
- And the King needs to realize

57:09.240 --> 57:13.128
he's a guest in his castle
and he better mind his P's and Q's

57:13.240 --> 57:15.260
because the Step King
has had it up to here

57:15.360 --> 57:16.771
with the King's bullshit!

57:17.000 --> 57:18.260
Brad said a naughty word.

57:18.360 --> 57:22.100
Kids, I'm so sorry you had to hear
that inappropriate language.

57:22.200 --> 57:23.340
Make sure you tell your mother.

57:23.440 --> 57:25.124
Brad, can I talk to you
in the hall, please?

57:25.520 --> 57:26.965
(SIGHS)

57:27.520 --> 57:30.251
Brad, what just happened in there, man?

57:30.520 --> 57:32.780
(WHISPERING) Look, the Step King
should not have

57:32.880 --> 57:36.620
used inappropriate language in front of
the Prince and Princess, he admits that.

57:36.720 --> 57:37.721
Why are you still saying it
like that, Brad?

57:37.840 --> 57:38.860
We're out in the hall.

57:38.960 --> 57:41.042
I don't know. I'm upset.

57:41.280 --> 57:42.566
- (CELL PHONE VIBRATING)
- Hold on.

57:43.200 --> 57:44.326
Oh-ho-ho! Hello?

57:44.800 --> 57:46.723
Yeah, Brad's here, he's doing good.

57:46.960 --> 57:48.180
Hey, it's Dr. Francisco.

57:48.280 --> 57:49.780
He wants us all to come in tomorrow.
9:30 work for you?

57:49.880 --> 57:50.860
- Yeah, I guess so.
- Yeah,

57:50.960 --> 57:53.247
we'll see you then.
All right, bud. Come on, man.

57:53.880 --> 57:55.780
The doctor will be with you in a moment.

57:55.880 --> 57:57.245
ALL: Thank you.

58:01.080 --> 58:02.060
(SARA GRUNTING)

58:02.160 --> 58:05.571
Hey, Brad, whatever happens
here, I just want you to know

58:05.680 --> 58:07.540
that I'm proud of you for doing your best.

58:07.640 --> 58:08.801
- Okay?
- Thank you.

58:08.920 --> 58:12.561
Hello, hello. Okay.
I'm going to cut right to the chase.

58:12.840 --> 58:15.411
Sara, I'm afraid I've got some bad news.

58:15.720 --> 58:17.900
Oh, God. That is a tough break. I'm sorry.

58:18.000 --> 58:20.220
Damn, that is a real shame.
My heart is melting.

58:20.320 --> 58:21.980
Yeah, it's a real shame, Sara.

58:22.080 --> 58:23.500
A real shame that
you're gonna have to put up

58:23.600 --> 58:25.011
with Brad here pounding away on you

58:25.240 --> 58:28.220
over and over,
now that he's got a fighting chance

58:28.320 --> 58:29.685
of getting you pregnant.

58:30.080 --> 58:32.140
- (GASPING)
- What? Oh, my God!

58:32.240 --> 58:34.447
- Holy moly!
- Oh, my God.

58:35.080 --> 58:37.401
Hey, Doc, Doc, don't give them
a false sense of hope.

58:37.520 --> 58:40.540
Remember what you said about
the blood flow and the screwy 'nads?

58:40.640 --> 58:42.820
Yeah, well, Brad has you
to thank for that, Dusty.

58:42.920 --> 58:45.340
Okay, in lab rats,
whenever another alpha male

58:45.440 --> 58:48.540
comes around, it can spike testosterone,
driving up sperm counts.

58:48.640 --> 58:51.300
Now, no guarantees, okay?
But with my help, Brad,

58:51.400 --> 58:54.100
I think you got enough left in the tank
to make it all the way to baby town.

58:54.200 --> 58:55.340
That's so wonderful. Thank you.

58:55.440 --> 58:57.940
- BOTH: Thank you so much.
- Of course.

58:58.040 --> 58:59.963
- Can we give you a hug?
- Oh, yeah. Come on in.

59:00.960 --> 59:02.610
BRAD: Oh, my gosh.

59:03.120 --> 59:05.009
- Did not expect this.
- Mmm...

59:06.040 --> 59:07.769
(HIP-HOP MUSIC PLAYING)

59:20.320 --> 59:22.482
You virile sea snake, you.

59:22.600 --> 59:24.807
- I underestimated you, Brad.
- Yes, you did.

59:25.240 --> 59:28.722
I can finally give Sara everything,
and it feels good.

59:29.000 --> 59:30.140
Now, listen, this is what you need to do.

59:30.240 --> 59:33.323
You need to go and pee outside
the room that Dusty sleeps in.

59:33.440 --> 59:35.900
He's gonna smell your urine and know that

59:36.000 --> 59:38.446
your virility is not to be taken lightly.

59:39.560 --> 59:41.801
It's good advice.
I did it last year in the lobby.

59:41.960 --> 59:44.060
Oh, I remember. It was a health hazard.

59:44.160 --> 59:45.220
It scared the FedEx guy.

59:45.320 --> 59:47.687
No, I'm going to take
the high road on this one.

59:47.800 --> 59:49.245
Okay, fine, take the high road.

59:49.400 --> 59:52.051
But jam a baby up in there
as quickly as you can, Brad.

59:52.320 --> 59:54.900
Because, in the end, if Sara
does choose Dusty over you,

59:55.000 --> 59:57.620
he has to be stepdad to your baby.

59:57.720 --> 59:58.900
- How beautiful is that?
- (LAUGHS)

59:59.000 --> 01:00:00.260
Come on, five it.

01:00:00.360 --> 01:00:02.900
No. You know, it feels strange

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:06.460
to high-five over the custody
of my unborn child.

01:00:06.560 --> 01:00:07.620
I've been on Dusty's team.

01:00:07.720 --> 01:00:10.260
I'm trying to jump over
to the winning team Brad.

01:00:10.360 --> 01:00:12.249
- Get on this.
- I'd really rather not.

01:00:12.360 --> 01:00:15.125
I'm trying to share a moment
with you here. Please five me.

01:00:15.240 --> 01:00:17.368
It feels... No, thanks.

01:00:17.800 --> 01:00:19.060
- Got it!
- Wait. No.

01:00:19.160 --> 01:00:20.420
- Sweet.
- It didn't count.

01:00:20.520 --> 01:00:21.601
I love you, Brad.

01:00:21.720 --> 01:00:22.940
It's not a binding high-five.

01:00:23.040 --> 01:00:24.405
Fat beans in there.

01:00:25.240 --> 01:00:26.890
- Dusty?
- Brad.

01:00:27.240 --> 01:00:28.765
What can I do for you?

01:00:29.080 --> 01:00:31.606
Oh, wow, that's some impressive up-downs.

01:00:31.920 --> 01:00:33.251
Look, uh,

01:00:34.200 --> 01:00:37.886
what you did for Sara and me,

01:00:38.080 --> 01:00:39.605
that's a life-changer, and

01:00:40.280 --> 01:00:42.089
I just wanted to say thank you.

01:00:42.440 --> 01:00:44.090
And I'm sorry.

01:00:44.400 --> 01:00:45.731
Sorry for what?

01:00:46.280 --> 01:00:48.282
Well, here's the thing.

01:00:48.880 --> 01:00:51.565
I mean, you show up,

01:00:52.600 --> 01:00:56.286
here's this guy who's cool and exciting.

01:00:56.600 --> 01:01:01.640
I guess I felt a little competitive, and
slightly insecure, and I start thinking,

01:01:01.760 --> 01:01:04.286
well, maybe you want to challenge me.

01:01:05.640 --> 01:01:07.980
But today you proved that
all you really care about

01:01:08.080 --> 01:01:09.491
is our family's happiness.

01:01:09.600 --> 01:01:10.726
Oh, man.

01:01:10.960 --> 01:01:12.291
I'm humbled.

01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:14.129
I mean it. And you know what?

01:01:14.600 --> 01:01:17.080
You're right. I was challenging you, Brad.

01:01:17.280 --> 01:01:18.805
- Yeah?
- The truth?

01:01:19.640 --> 01:01:21.500
I see this new man in my kids' life.

01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:24.490
He's kind and caring and successful,
and I don't even want to like you.

01:01:25.160 --> 01:01:27.561
But I can't help it. I like you, Brad.

01:01:28.160 --> 01:01:29.161
Really?

01:01:29.320 --> 01:01:31.641
I was determined to push you out
and get my family back.

01:01:31.760 --> 01:01:34.340
I was underhanded
and disingenuous about it.

01:01:34.440 --> 01:01:35.900
I feel like a monster.

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:37.923
No. No, no, no.

01:01:39.600 --> 01:01:42.968
At the risk of being disrespectful,
I want you to shut your mouth.

01:01:43.440 --> 01:01:46.569
You are allowed
to have those feelings. Okay?

01:01:47.240 --> 01:01:49.811
Heck, we're talking about
your own children here, for cripes' sake.

01:01:51.160 --> 01:01:52.400
Clean slate?

01:01:52.800 --> 01:01:54.131
Absolutely.

01:01:54.880 --> 01:01:55.961
Come here.

You know what's funny?
You're not even sweating,

01:02:01.320 --> 01:02:03.243
after doing all those push-ups.

01:02:03.440 --> 01:02:04.646
That's exemplary.

01:02:05.200 --> 01:02:06.201
(SIGHS)

01:02:08.840 --> 01:02:10.060
Thank you, Dusty.

01:02:10.160 --> 01:02:11.161
Thank you, Brad.

01:02:14.840 --> 01:02:15.841
Oh, uh...

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:20.420
You know, all that stuff about pushing
me out and taking over my family,

01:02:20.520 --> 01:02:22.090
I mean, we're through all that, right?

01:02:22.480 --> 01:02:24.380
Oh, no, no, no. I'm here to defeat you

01:02:24.480 --> 01:02:26.260
and take back my family.
That can't change.

01:02:26.360 --> 01:02:29.045
But now I'll follow your noble example
and do it above board.

01:02:29.360 --> 01:02:32.125
Honestly. Like a man. Like you.

01:02:32.560 --> 01:02:35.643
But we just hugged. You said you like me.

01:02:36.160 --> 01:02:37.540
Oh, I do like you, Brad, very much.

01:02:37.640 --> 01:02:38.880
It doesn't make this any easier.

01:02:39.200 --> 01:02:41.726
You know I'm gonna have to tell Sara
what you said in here today.

01:02:41.840 --> 01:02:44.047
Of course.
It would be irresponsible not to.

01:02:44.360 --> 01:02:45.940
She's not gonna like it.
She's gonna want you out.

01:02:46.040 --> 01:02:47.300
You're right about that, Brad.

01:02:47.400 --> 01:02:48.740
What the hell are you up to?

01:02:48.840 --> 01:02:50.365
I just told you what I'm up to.

01:02:50.560 --> 01:02:52.562
My head is spinning right now.

01:02:52.840 --> 01:02:55.241
Hey, you got any sweet potatoes? Or yams?

01:02:55.360 --> 01:02:56.620
Sweet potatoes or yams?

01:02:56.720 --> 01:02:59.140
Griff, you know we have yams, all right?

01:02:59.240 --> 01:03:00.940
You made me buy them for you.

01:03:01.040 --> 01:03:02.769
I wanted to respect
your house by asking you

01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:05.180
before I got them.
I didn't want to just go grab yams.

01:03:05.280 --> 01:03:07.140
Okay, I appreciate that.
I'm dealing with something.

01:03:07.240 --> 01:03:09.460
- Just go get the yams.
- All right.

01:03:09.560 --> 01:03:11.483
Here's the thing. You're right, Dusty.

01:03:11.600 --> 01:03:13.762
Yeah. I'm not going to tell Sara.

01:03:14.040 --> 01:03:15.929
But I'm gonna prove to you
that I'm the best.

01:03:16.200 --> 01:03:19.204
You can eat my dust, Dusty.

01:03:35.120 --> 01:03:38.420
Christmas already?
Why didn't anybody tell me?

01:03:38.520 --> 01:03:40.329
It's not. It's the middle of April.

01:03:42.240 --> 01:03:44.891
- Daddy must have done this!
- BRAD: Ho, ho, ho, ho!

01:03:45.400 --> 01:03:47.402
No, he didn't. (LAUGHS)

01:03:47.960 --> 01:03:49.610
- Brad.
- Ho, ho!

Claus is the name.
Santa Claus, if you please.

01:03:52.640 --> 01:03:56.300
But this Brad you speak of called me
all the way up at the North Pole.

01:03:56.400 --> 01:03:59.085
He said his children were so sad because

01:03:59.280 --> 01:04:01.806
their biological father had missed so many

01:04:01.920 --> 01:04:04.140
Christmases and birthdays

01:04:04.240 --> 01:04:06.980
and special family holidays,
so he asked me

01:04:07.080 --> 01:04:09.700
to come here today so that Dusty

01:04:09.800 --> 01:04:13.889
could experience one Christmas
with his kids before he leaves again.

01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:15.860
Probably for a long, long time.

01:04:15.960 --> 01:04:16.961
Ho, ho, ho!

01:04:17.120 --> 01:04:18.485
Can we open presents?

01:04:18.800 --> 01:04:20.643
You sure can, little girl.

01:04:20.760 --> 01:04:22.125
I think they're from Brad.

01:04:22.360 --> 01:04:24.283
In fact, all the presents are from Brad.

01:04:24.640 --> 01:04:27.166
Let's see if any of the
presents are from Dusty.

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:32.420
Nope. Not one present from Dusty.
All from Brad.

01:04:32.520 --> 01:04:35.420
Hey, kids, let's not forget
who got you a dog. Remember?

01:04:35.520 --> 01:04:37.340
Hey, Tumor, quit humping Mrs. Claus!

(GROWLING)

01:04:38.960 --> 01:04:41.020
Okay, I am officially worried about you.

01:04:41.120 --> 01:04:43.407
Don't worry, Claus hasn't forgotten you.

01:04:44.920 --> 01:04:45.900
Huh?

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:47.650
- For me?
- Yeah.

I love it.

It's a pony, Dusty! A pony!

01:05:18.880 --> 01:05:20.245
Can we name her Princess Elsa?

01:05:20.400 --> 01:05:23.961
You can name him whatever you want,
because it's yours!

01:05:24.600 --> 01:05:25.820
Brad, how can we afford a pony?

01:05:25.920 --> 01:05:27.206
Where are we even going to put that thing?

01:05:27.360 --> 01:05:29.580
I can clear out some stable
space in the garage.

01:05:29.680 --> 01:05:31.205
Look, it's only half a horse.

01:05:31.840 --> 01:05:34.844
Okay? Think of it like
a big dog, only a lot better.

01:05:35.240 --> 01:05:37.368
Oh, what's this? What the heck?

01:05:37.560 --> 01:05:40.820
It's tickets to tonight's
NBA playoff game...

01:05:40.920 --> 01:05:42.700
- What?
- ...against Dylan's favorite team,

No. It's not fair.

You know what, actually, it's very fair.
Okay? She has two dads.

You just have to accept that.

and now he gets to go as well? No!

you're not acting like a crazy person,

in your $18,000 seats,

so, yeah, I'll be here every day.

01:15:11.440 --> 01:15:14.205
Great. So, if your kids aren't out here,
I'm gonna need you to circle around

01:15:14.320 --> 01:15:15.340
to the back of the line. Okay?

01:15:15.440 --> 01:15:17.340
- No, I can't go around.
- Thanks.

01:15:17.440 --> 01:15:18.780
I came ten minutes early
so I don't have to...

01:15:18.880 --> 01:15:20.928
If your kids aren't here,
you have to go around!

01:15:21.040 --> 01:15:22.820
I know. There's somebody
in front of me. Okay?

01:15:22.920 --> 01:15:23.921
Just go around!

01:15:24.040 --> 01:15:26.180
I can't just go over the
cones! I'm boxed in here!

01:15:26.280 --> 01:15:27.964
- Go around!
- No, you can't! Okay?

01:15:28.120 --> 01:15:29.500
She said stay in the cone, like ice cream!

01:15:29.600 --> 01:15:31.170
- (HONKING)
- Go around!

01:15:31.280 --> 01:15:32.441
DORIS: Inside the cones!

01:15:32.720 --> 01:15:34.131
Amanda has got a recital!

01:15:34.240 --> 01:15:36.811
I have to get there! You need to go!

01:15:44.440 --> 01:15:46.886
We always stay inside the cones!

(MR. HOLT SIGHING)

01:15:56.800 --> 01:15:59.770
Have you been living here
for the last few days, Brad?

01:15:59.960 --> 01:16:00.961
No.

01:16:01.800 --> 01:16:06.169
Then what's with the blankets
and the hot plate

01:16:06.800 --> 01:16:07.926
and the B.O.?

01:16:08.480 --> 01:16:11.211
I crapped in the wastebasket.

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:15.641
You know, Brad, two years
into my thing with Charlene,

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.844
her first husband showed up.
Oriental fellow.

01:16:19.120 --> 01:16:22.010
You can't say that.
You cannot say "Oriental."

01:16:22.120 --> 01:16:26.125
His name was Yu or Wu.
It could have been Javier.

01:16:26.480 --> 01:16:29.848
Anyway, I get off early one day,
get home, and

01:16:30.120 --> 01:16:32.202
there he is, stark naked in our bed.

01:16:32.520 --> 01:16:33.700
I didn't know what to think.

01:16:33.800 --> 01:16:36.485
Really? You didn't know what to think?

01:16:36.680 --> 01:16:40.002
Six months later,
I wake up in a Chinese prison

01:16:40.360 --> 01:16:44.842
with a tattoo on my lower back
of a golf ball rolling towards my butthole.

01:16:45.160 --> 01:16:47.100
I can't hear these stories anymore.

01:16:47.200 --> 01:16:49.168
I'm sorry. I know they're
supposed to help...

01:16:49.360 --> 01:16:51.362
Griff! What are you doing here?

01:16:51.680 --> 01:16:53.808
Thought you should know
Dusty came by the bar earlier.

01:16:54.280 --> 01:16:56.100
He was talking about how
he can't do the daddy thing.

01:16:56.200 --> 01:16:59.420
I tried to talk some sense into him, but
he seemed determined to get out of town.

01:16:59.520 --> 01:17:00.521
What, he's leaving?

01:17:00.640 --> 01:17:03.450
I don't think I have to tell you,
but little Megan's dance is tonight,

01:17:03.920 --> 01:17:05.140
and she's not going to have a daddy.

01:17:05.240 --> 01:17:08.050
That's fantastic. Brad, you win.

01:17:08.200 --> 01:17:11.647
And Dusty, because of
an act of cowardice, loses.

01:17:12.040 --> 01:17:13.883
I mean, you're the daddy again.

01:17:14.200 --> 01:17:15.884
Come on, hit that.

01:17:18.600 --> 01:17:19.886

01:17:20.560 --> 01:17:22.005
No, I'm not her daddy.

01:17:23.720 --> 01:17:26.246
I wish more than anything I was,

01:17:27.520 --> 01:17:28.567
but I'm not.

01:17:28.840 --> 01:17:33.243
Yeah, you're right, Brad. A real dad
wouldn't give up on his kids so easy.

01:17:36.160 --> 01:17:37.161
(DOOR CLOSING)

01:17:42.560 --> 01:17:43.561
Griff!

01:17:43.760 --> 01:17:45.603
Wait!

01:17:45.920 --> 01:17:47.410
He's still in the room, Brad.

01:17:47.760 --> 01:17:49.250
Oh, hey.

01:17:49.720 --> 01:17:51.927
Sorry. I thought you stormed out.

01:17:52.240 --> 01:17:55.881
What you said sounded like a storm-out,
and then I heard the door close.

01:17:56.080 --> 01:17:57.820
I just thought that shit
was getting kind of personal,

01:17:57.920 --> 01:17:59.604
so it'd be good to close the door.

01:17:59.880 --> 01:18:03.248
So extremely thoughtful. Thank you. Yeah.

01:18:03.440 --> 01:18:06.900
And just so you know where my head was at,

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.367
I was going to chase you
down the hallway. Right?

01:18:09.920 --> 01:18:12.820
You'd hear my footsteps and you're like,
"Is someone after... What's going on?"

01:18:12.920 --> 01:18:17.130
Boom! It's me, and I'm like, "Griff, hey!

01:18:17.440 --> 01:18:18.700
"You were right."

01:18:18.800 --> 01:18:22.282
Holy shit! That would be so uplifting.

01:18:23.440 --> 01:18:24.441
Can we do that?

01:18:25.440 --> 01:18:27.660
Griff, can you storm out, and Brad,
you go after him?

01:18:27.760 --> 01:18:29.683
I don't really want any part of that.

01:18:29.800 --> 01:18:32.180
That sounds like pure nonsense to me.

01:18:32.280 --> 01:18:34.567
I don't want... I'd rather not.

01:18:35.040 --> 01:18:37.281
We could just try it, you know?

01:18:37.480 --> 01:18:41.121
No, that sounds forced and weird to try to

01:18:41.480 --> 01:18:44.020
recreate something. Not even recreate.

01:18:44.120 --> 01:18:46.122
It would be creating. It didn't happen.

01:18:46.480 --> 01:18:48.164
It's over-discussed at this point.

01:18:48.440 --> 01:18:49.380
Shouldn't you go see your kid?

01:18:49.480 --> 01:18:50.970
- Yeah. Yeah.
- All right.

01:18:51.280 --> 01:18:52.805
You guys go. Brad, can I come?

Oh, honey, he'll be here. He promised.

I see cupcakes over there.

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:22.525

Where are you going?

01:19:43.880 --> 01:19:46.140
I'd pay a billion dollars
to take her to that dance.

- You're just gonna leave?
- You take her then.

01:19:48.160 --> 01:19:50.420
I can't take her. Okay?
I'm not welcome after I said

01:19:50.520 --> 01:19:52.100
I was gonna put a spite baby
in her mother.

01:19:52.200 --> 01:19:54.100
- I guess that's out, then.
- Yeah, that is out.

What do you mean, you can't do it?

01:20:00.840 --> 01:20:02.660
I can't stay inside the cones.

01:20:02.760 --> 01:20:04.820
Look, Dusty, the cones are
there for everyone's safety.

01:20:04.920 --> 01:20:07.580
- It's not about the cones.
- You just said it was.

01:20:07.680 --> 01:20:09.125
The cones are a metaphor, Brad.

I'm not the domestic type, okay?

01:20:11.800 --> 01:20:13.220
Dusty, come on.
What are you talking about?

01:20:13.320 --> 01:20:15.540
You're organized, you're handy.

01:20:15.640 --> 01:20:17.980
You make the best cinnamon rolls
I have ever tasted.

01:20:18.080 --> 01:20:19.300
Those were Cinnabons, Brad. Come on.

01:20:19.400 --> 01:20:21.260
You can't make rolls like that
in a conventional oven.

01:20:21.360 --> 01:20:24.728
I knew it! I knew it.
I knew it from the beginning!

01:20:25.320 --> 01:20:26.620
So you've been telling
some tall tales, huh?

01:20:26.720 --> 01:20:29.020
- All that Special Ops stuff.
- No, just the Cinnabons!

01:20:29.120 --> 01:20:30.740
Why would you lie about Cinnabons?

'Cause I wanted to win. All right?

I was a good dad, too, but I'm not.

Is that what you want to hear?

Dads have to make a lot of choices, okay?

01:20:46.040 --> 01:20:47.246
And we blow most of them.

01:20:47.360 --> 01:20:48.500
Yeah, and the other parents.

01:20:48.600 --> 01:20:51.500
That kid, Eli. I was over there
for a play date. You know about this?

01:20:51.600 --> 01:20:53.340
You can't just ride your bike
over to a friend's house,

01:20:53.440 --> 01:20:55.820
to play Hot Wheels anymore,
now you got to make some kind of date?

01:20:55.920 --> 01:20:57.331
- I know, it's a shame.
- Well, I'm over there,

01:20:57.440 --> 01:20:59.460
and the kid's dad keeps
asking me if Dylan's gonna be

01:20:59.560 --> 01:21:00.700
in the gifted program with Eli.

01:21:00.800 --> 01:21:02.740
Like Dylan isn't as smart as
his little ball-scratcher kid.

01:21:02.840 --> 01:21:04.580
I wanted to murder that smug prick.

01:21:04.680 --> 01:21:07.860
Dusty, look, I hate that guy, too, okay?

01:21:07.960 --> 01:21:10.611
But his son is Dylan's best friend,
so you suck it up.

01:21:11.880 --> 01:21:17.060

what dads do, is take shit.

01:21:19.200 --> 01:21:22.020
I can't do it, Brad.
I can't take shit like you do.

You take shit better than
anyone I've ever met,

01:21:24.440 --> 01:21:26.568

from the bottom of my heart.

Ow, yes.

but to bust you up now?

I really wish you wouldn't.

If I did, you'd take that beatdown
for those kids, wouldn't you?

01:21:53.640 --> 01:21:56.166
Yeah. Yeah, I would.

- Good luck, Dusty.

01:22:07.440 --> 01:22:09.090
What? No, no, you gotta come.

01:22:09.760 --> 01:22:13.620
It's just... I can't see Sara
after what I said.

01:22:13.720 --> 01:22:15.820
Sara loves you, Brad. All right?
I know just what to say to her.

01:22:15.920 --> 01:22:17.660
You just stand there
and look lost without her.

01:22:17.760 --> 01:22:19.922
- I am lost without her.
- Well, that's good. Then let's go.

01:22:20.080 --> 01:22:22.731
- But I look terrible.
- Yeah, you do. Come here.

- I'm fixing you up, man.

Calm down. Think I want to
touch your little dinky?

Wow. I look great.

Whoa, whoa, whoa... Uh-oh.

She's doing her arms-folded thing.

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:15.540
You said she'd smile.
Maybe even start a slow clap.

Don't worry, I got this. Okay? Come on.

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:21.322

stranded his kids at school.

And look who he's with.

on your way over here, Brad?

- No!

- Sara, please.
- No. I am not going to listen to you.

sitting there for two hours, heartbroken.

just ask your daughter to dance?

- Go ahead, Dusty.
- No, you take the first one.

to the kids and I'll take the first dance.

01:23:57.440 --> 01:24:00.046
I'll say my good-byes,
and then I'll get out of your hair.

01:24:02.040 --> 01:24:04.540
Wait, wait. When you say
"get out of your hair,"

01:24:04.640 --> 01:24:06.780
you mean leave, like leave-leave? Tonight?

01:24:06.880 --> 01:24:09.540
Daddy! Brad! The fourth graders are here.

01:24:09.640 --> 01:24:11.404
They're picking on Dylan again.

01:24:11.720 --> 01:24:13.860
That's it.
Those little shitheads are dead.

01:24:13.960 --> 01:24:15.086
Where are they?

01:24:16.760 --> 01:24:18.125
DUSTY: Those are the fourth graders?

01:24:18.240 --> 01:24:20.846
- They're girls.
- Uh-huh. They're so mean.

01:24:20.960 --> 01:24:22.700
Why are you even here at
the Daddy-Daughter Dance?

01:24:22.800 --> 01:24:24.420
Are you a daughter? Are you a girl?

01:24:24.520 --> 01:24:27.540
Are you too scared to take me on
without your little friends?

01:24:27.640 --> 01:24:29.220
- Oh, no, he's calling out the big one.
- Oh-oh.

01:24:29.320 --> 01:24:30.321
Oh, no, no, no.

01:24:31.560 --> 01:24:32.561
Come on!

01:24:33.120 --> 01:24:34.201
Dylan!

01:24:34.840 --> 01:24:36.171
- (ALL GASP)
- Yes!

01:24:36.400 --> 01:24:39.060
- Dylan, what are you doing?
- Did you see? Did you see?

01:24:39.160 --> 01:24:40.605
I punched her in the face,
just like you taught me.

01:24:40.720 --> 01:24:42.420
- What?
- And then I kicked her right in the nuts.

01:24:42.520 --> 01:24:44.045
You like that, bitch? Huh?

01:24:44.160 --> 01:24:45.650
- No, no, no!
- You want some more, bitch?

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:48.401
Sweetheart, what happened?
What's going on here?

01:24:48.520 --> 01:24:50.090
He punched me in the face.

01:24:50.200 --> 01:24:51.900
Then he kicked me in the swimsuit area.

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:53.820
Then he called me the "B" word.

01:24:53.920 --> 01:24:55.060
Who did, him?

01:24:55.160 --> 01:24:57.049
He did. I saw it.
He said they taught him to hit girls.

01:24:57.160 --> 01:24:59.367
No, no. We thought
your daughter was a boy.

01:24:59.480 --> 01:25:00.900
- What?
- No, what he means is that

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:02.820
Dylan told us that a fourth grader
was picking on him,

01:25:02.920 --> 01:25:04.260
but he didn't tell us it was a girl.

01:25:04.360 --> 01:25:06.740
Yeah, and if you had, we'd have told you
it's never okay to hit a girl.

01:25:06.840 --> 01:25:09.121
And that she's probably only bugging you
because she likes you, buddy.

01:25:09.360 --> 01:25:11.124
I do not like him.

01:25:11.360 --> 01:25:12.740
Oh, I think she likes him.

01:25:12.840 --> 01:25:14.524
Ah, gross, whatever.

01:25:14.640 --> 01:25:15.980
She totally does.

01:25:16.080 --> 01:25:17.380
Are you calling my daughter a whore?

01:25:17.480 --> 01:25:19.100
- What?
- They were implying it, Jerry.

01:25:19.200 --> 01:25:20.326
Wait. That's quite a stretch.

01:25:20.600 --> 01:25:22.602
Mrs. Troy, please. I got this.

01:25:22.880 --> 01:25:24.962
Wait, first of all, which one
of you two is the kid's dad?

01:25:25.280 --> 01:25:26.340
They both are.

01:25:26.440 --> 01:25:27.521
(GASPS)

01:25:27.640 --> 01:25:29.642
Oh, my gosh. Wow!

01:25:30.040 --> 01:25:33.203
I'm sorry. That's the first time
he's ever referred to me as Dad.

01:25:33.880 --> 01:25:37.420
It's something I've wanted to hear
for a long time, so it's a bit poignant.

01:25:37.520 --> 01:25:39.682
I tend to cry a lot

01:25:40.040 --> 01:25:43.460
when things get emotional.
They tease me all the time.

01:25:43.560 --> 01:25:45.300
- I'm actually the stepdad.
- Oh, is that right?

01:25:45.400 --> 01:25:46.731
So you're the real dad, huh!

01:25:47.640 --> 01:25:49.340
Hey. You don't want to
embarrass yourself, buddy.

01:25:49.440 --> 01:25:51.180
You threatening me now, tough guy?

01:25:51.280 --> 01:25:53.521
- He's threatening you, Jerry.
- Nobody's threatening anybody.

01:25:53.640 --> 01:25:55.180
But you're gonna want to
back that up, Jerry.

01:25:55.280 --> 01:25:56.805
And you, Squidward tie.
Quit being an instigator,

01:25:56.920 --> 01:25:58.460
or I'm gonna have to rap you in the mouth.

01:25:58.560 --> 01:25:59.620

We're at the Daddy-Daughter Dance.

01:26:03.360 --> 01:26:05.020
You stay out of it, all right?
You don't count!

01:26:05.120 --> 01:26:06.690
I want to talk to the real dad here.

01:26:06.800 --> 01:26:08.900
Hey, Brad here is more of
a real dad than any of us.

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.761
You ever want to see how you should be
raising your kids, go look at this guy.

01:26:12.520 --> 01:26:15.171
Here I go again. What did I tell you?

01:26:15.840 --> 01:26:18.820
- Really? You mean that?
- Yes, I do, Brad.

01:26:18.920 --> 01:26:20.001
You're a great dad.

01:26:20.640 --> 01:26:22.130
(ALL GASPING)

01:26:23.280 --> 01:26:24.380
- Like that?
- You shouldn't have done that.

01:26:24.480 --> 01:26:25.620
Yeah? Why?

01:26:25.720 --> 01:26:27.324
I'm pretty sure he kills people for a job.

01:26:27.680 --> 01:26:31.002
He's been rather vague with me,
but that's what I'm kind of surmising.

01:26:31.200 --> 01:26:32.700
- Are we gonna do this?
- DUSTY: Oh, we're gonna do it.

01:26:32.800 --> 01:26:34.340
- Okay. You ready?
- DUSTY: Yeah, I'm ready.

01:26:34.440 --> 01:26:36.124
- This is what you get.
- MEGAN: Daddy.

Is this like some UFC shit?

DUSTY: Come on, Brad.

01:26:57.960 --> 01:26:59.291
That's right. It's a dance, Jerry.

01:26:59.400 --> 01:27:01.721
Yeah. So dance, Jerry!

01:27:06.720 --> 01:27:09.940
Yeah! You just got served, Jerry!

01:27:10.040 --> 01:27:11.860
You just got a piping hot serving.

I'm not getting served.
You're getting served!

but I like to move my body.

01:27:58.680 --> 01:27:59.681
You want me to stay?

You don't want to miss it.

01:28:46.240 --> 01:28:49.643
And with the huge amount of money
he was making as the voice of The Panda,

01:28:49.760 --> 01:28:52.610
he built his own new castle
right down the street.

01:28:53.760 --> 01:28:54.921
Hey!

01:28:55.520 --> 01:28:58.410

get along with Dusty's new puppy.

with his new wife

- Want to go play?

That's your brother and sister.
You guys play nice, okay?

You want to come to Daddy?

What, you think I'm going to
pick his pockets or something?

- He doesn't carry a wallet.

with that knife, okay?

Being a stepdad isn't always easy.

But he was also right that it's worth it.

01:30:14.240 --> 01:30:16.402
And he was right about the Ford Flex, too.
