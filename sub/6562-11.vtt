THAT THE GIRL WHO SAVED MY LIFE
EARLIER TODAY IS A MERMAID?

15:41.474 --> 15:43.176

IN MERTEENS 4:
ESCAPE FROM SEAQUARIUM,

15:45.445 --> 15:49.482

MERMAIDS ON LAND

15:59.092 --> 16:00.393
HAVE TO AVOID GETTING WET,

16:00.427 --> 16:04.231
BECAUSE THEY WOULD IMMEDIATELY
SPROUT A TAIL.

16:04.264 --> 16:06.766

I'VE GOT NO CHAIRS.

17:10.363 --> 17:13.300
I'VE NOT GOT ANY ICE SCULPTURES,
AND WORST OF ALL,

17:13.333 --> 17:15.602
THERE IS NO CENTERPIECE.

17:15.635 --> 17:17.104
I'M ANGRY, MARVIN.

I HAD A DREAM.

17:39.292 --> 17:40.693
I WANT WEENIES AT MY PARTY.

17:40.727 --> 17:43.263

YOUR SENSE OF SMELL IS DIRECTLY
CONNECTED TO YOUR MEMORY, RIGHT?

17:55.575 --> 17:58.511
- RIGHT,
OR WE COULD FORGET THE PLAN

17:58.545 --> 18:00.213
AND GO HAVE A FUN DAY
AT THE BEACH.

ALL THEY'RE THINK IS STINK.

PATCHY'S TREASURE
IS A MILLION-DOLLAR BEACH HOUSE.

24:54.026 --> 24:56.896
- PATCHY,
THIS HOUSE ISN'T YOUR TREASURE.

24:56.929 --> 24:58.698
THIS HOUSE WAS BUILT ON TOP
OF THE TREASURE.

24:58.731 --> 25:01.968

MING VASE COLLECTION.

25:24.991 --> 25:26.926

25:29.729 --> 25:31.330
I NEED A BAND TO MAKE
THE PARTY SUCCESSFUL,

25:31.363 --> 25:34.033

26:38.164 --> 26:42.234
SHE'S SWEET, SHE'S GOT FEET,
AND I'M FALLING FOR HER.

26:42.268 --> 26:43.202

31:41.467 --> 31:42.668
- PROMISE RINGS?

31:42.701 --> 31:45.404
- JO, THIS IS A LONG STORY,
BUT I CAN EXPLAIN EVERYTHING.

31:45.437 --> 31:46.472

32:21.040 --> 32:22.108

32:22.141 --> 32:23.609

SOME THOUGHT.

32:23.642 --> 32:28.414
THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY
TO SETTLE THIS, A DRAG RACE.

32:28.447 --> 32:30.516

32:39.225 --> 32:43.529
LEAVE THE BEACH
NEVER TO RETURN AGAIN.

32:43.562 --> 32:44.630
- WHAT?

32:44.663 --> 32:46.999
