WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:03.321
***

00:03.370 --> 00:05.463
HEY, COME ON, GUYS,
IT'S NOT THE END OF THE WORLD.

00:05.500 --> 00:06.831
YOU KNOW,
SO I'M ON DESK DUTY,

00:06.870 --> 00:09.259
AND IT MIGHT JUST BE
A FEW WEEKS, BUT IT'S FINE.

00:09.310 --> 00:10.959
I FEEL LIKE SOMEONE'S
BREAKING UP THE BAND.

00:11.010 --> 00:13.535
YEAH, THAT'S JUST SILLY,
'CAUSE WE'RE NOT A BAND.

00:13.580 --> 00:16.071
BUT IF WE WERE,
I WOULD BE YOKO.

00:16.110 --> 00:18.249
SO YOU ALL
SHOULD BE CELEBRATING.

00:18.280 --> 00:20.475
(laughing)
BUT, I MEAN, IT IS WEIRD.

00:20.520 --> 00:22.283
I HAVE NEVER
BEEN FIRED BEFORE.

00:22.320 --> 00:23.787
I NEVER.

00:23.820 --> 00:25.811
HEAR, HEAR.
(glasses clink)

00:25.850 --> 00:28.057
I NEVER HAD SEX WITH ANYONE
FROM 15 DIVISION.

00:28.090 --> 00:31.059
(laughter)

00:31.090 --> 00:32.728
WAIT--SERIOUSLY, I'M THE ONLY
ONE WHO'S NEVER HAD SEX

00:32.760 --> 00:34.648
WITH ANYONE FROM 15?

00:39.940 --> 00:41.191
AND EVEN LAST NIGHT,
YOU KNOW,

00:41.240 --> 00:43.037
SAM WAS THERE PLAYING POOL
WITH ANOTHER GIRL.

00:43.070 --> 00:44.401
I WASN'T EVEN JEALOUS.

00:44.440 --> 00:46.203
YOU KNOW, ALL I KEPT
THINKING TO MYSELF WAS,

00:46.240 --> 00:48.504
THAT MAN NEVER ONCE TOLD ME
ANYTHING ABOUT HIMSELF.

00:48.540 --> 00:50.178
NEVER SAID "I-I LOVE YOU."

00:50.210 --> 00:52.144
NEVER ONCE MADE AN EFFORT
TO MAKE THINGS WORK

00:52.180 --> 00:53.249
WHEN THINGS GOT TOUGH.

00:53.280 --> 00:55.271
IF YOU'RE GONNA
USE A FRENCH PRESS,

00:55.320 --> 00:57.686
YOU DO ONE HEAPING
TABLESPOON PER CUP.

00:57.720 --> 00:59.688
ARE YOU EVEN
LISTENING TO ME?

00:59.720 --> 01:00.857
OF COURSE
I'M LISTENING TO YOU.

01:00.890 --> 01:02.585
OKAY, WELL, THEN...

01:02.630 --> 01:03.949
DO YOU HAVE
ANY MOTHERLY THOUGHTS?

01:03.990 --> 01:06.049
GET OVER IT.
I AM OVER IT.

01:06.100 --> 01:08.227
THAT'S WHAT
I'M TRYING TO TELL YOU.

01:08.260 --> 01:09.989
IF YOU WERE OVER IT,
YOU WOULDN'T BE TRYING

01:10.030 --> 01:11.622
TO TELL ME ANYTHING.

01:11.670 --> 01:14.059
YOU'D BE FOCUSING
ON THIS TASK FORCE...
(water pouring)

01:14.100 --> 01:17.831
OR SIGNED UP FOR--
I DON'T KNOW, SCUBA LESSONS.

01:17.870 --> 01:19.007
(whispers)
SCUBA LESSONS.

01:19.910 --> 01:21.571
ANDY, IT'S BEEN
A MONTH AND A HALF.

01:21.610 --> 01:23.407
SO?

01:23.450 --> 01:26.248
SO...

01:26.280 --> 01:28.669
YOU NEED A CHANGE
OF SCENE.

01:28.720 --> 01:29.812
DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT.

01:29.850 --> 01:31.545
SOMETHING YOU'VE NEVER
DONE BEFORE.

01:31.590 --> 01:33.854
FIGURE OUT WHAT YOU WANT
BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.

01:33.890 --> 01:36.188
IT MAY NOT BE
THE MOST MOTHERLY ADVICE...

01:36.230 --> 01:38.528
(sweeps table)
BUT IT'S THE BEST I GOT.

01:38.560 --> 01:40.949
YEAH, YOU'RE REALLY BIG
ON CHANGES OF SCENE.

01:41.000 --> 01:42.991
YEAH, I AM.

01:43.030 --> 01:46.488
YOU'RE YOUNG. YOU GOT YOUR
WHOLE LIFE AHEAD OF YOU.

01:46.540 --> 01:48.292
DON'T BE THAT GIRL.

01:48.340 --> 01:49.932
WHAT GIRL?

01:49.970 --> 01:52.063
THAT GIRL THAT LETS SOME GUY
GET IN THE WAY

01:52.110 --> 01:54.078
OF EVERYTHING
SHE WANTS TO ACCOMPLISH.

01:55.280 --> 01:56.599
TRUST ME, YOU'LL REGRET IT.

01:56.650 --> 01:58.470
UH...

01:58.510 --> 02:00.444
THAT WAS ACTUALLY
PRETI'Y MOTHERLY.

02:03.720 --> 02:05.779
OLIVER, DON'T CLEAN MY TRUCK.

02:05.820 --> 02:07.356
YOU KNOW WHAT?
SOMEBODY'S GO'I'I'A DO IT.

02:07.390 --> 02:09.449
IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'VE
BEEN LIVING IN HERE.

02:09.490 --> 02:12.618
AND DON'T--DON'T EVEN GET ME
STARTED ABOUT YOUR HOUSE.

02:12.660 --> 02:14.252
IT WAS YOUR IDEA
TO CRASH THERE, MAN.

02:14.300 --> 02:15.255
YEAH, YEAH.

02:15.300 --> 02:16.824
AND I REGRETI'ED IT
FROM THE SECOND

02:16.870 --> 02:18.667
THAT I WADED
THROUGH YOUR FRONT DOOR.

02:18.700 --> 02:20.839
LISTEN, MAN--THIS?

02:20.870 --> 02:21.837
THIS IS NOT LIKE YOU.

02:21.870 --> 02:24.202
(truck door closes)
I WANT THIS.

02:24.240 --> 02:25.207
NEW ME.

02:25.240 --> 02:27.128
YEAH, WELL...

02:27.180 --> 02:29.671
THE NEW YOU NEEDS
A CLEANING LADY.

02:29.710 --> 02:32.417
OR MAYBE A GIRLFRIEND.
OR, HEY, MAYBE

02:32.450 --> 02:33.712
YOU COULD START BY ADMITI'ING

02:33.750 --> 02:35.615
THAT YOU MADE A MISTAKE
LEAVING YOUR LAST ONE.

02:35.650 --> 02:37.982
I'M GONNA GET A COFFEE.
DO YOU WANT A COFFEE?

02:38.020 --> 02:39.453
NO. YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
COME HERE.

02:39.490 --> 02:40.809
I'M--I'M SERIOUS.

02:40.860 --> 02:42.555
SAM, I KNOW YOU DON'T
WANNA BE ALONE.

02:42.590 --> 02:44.251
YOU JUST WANT
TO AVOID THE HARD STUFF.

02:44.290 --> 02:46.929
NO, NO, LISTEN.
LIKE CHANGING, GROWING.

02:46.960 --> 02:49.497
AND LET ME TELL YOU--
YOU DON'T GROW, YOU DIE.

02:49.530 --> 02:51.566
YOU KNOW, THAT IS
GENUINELY COOL ADVICE.

02:51.600 --> 02:53.295
AND I'M GONNA
RETURN THE FAVOR.

02:53.340 --> 02:56.229
I'M GONNA SUGGEST THAT YOU
START HOSTING

02:56.270 --> 02:57.703
YOUR OWN RADIO TALK SHOW.

02:57.740 --> 02:59.674
UGH. FUNNY.
HEY!

02:59.710 --> 03:02.270
DID ONE OF YOU LEAVE THIS
AT THE PENNY LAST NIGHT?

03:02.310 --> 03:03.538
THAT'S MINE.
AH. THERE YOU GO.

03:03.580 --> 03:04.569

03:07.480 --> 03:08.674
YEAH, YEAH. IT SURE WAS.

03:08.720 --> 03:09.948
SAM'S A GOOD POOL PLAYER.

03:09.990 --> 03:12.185
WELL, SO ARE YOU.
I MEAN, YOU'RE PERFECT FOR ME.

03:12.220 --> 03:14.154
YOU'RE--WELL, YOU'RE
RIGHT AT MY LEVEL.

03:14.190 --> 03:17.626
HEY, LISTEN, DID YOU WANNA
MAYBE PLAY AGAIN TONIGHT?

03:17.660 --> 03:20.356
UH, WHO?

03:20.400 --> 03:22.049
UH, YEAH, SURE.

03:22.100 --> 03:24.796
YEAH, THAT, UH,
THAT'D BE, UM, SURE.

03:24.830 --> 03:25.922
OKAY.

03:25.970 --> 03:27.767
THANK YOU.

03:35.980 --> 03:37.208
CAN I HELP YOU?

03:37.250 --> 03:39.002
YOUR TALK FORCE.
I WANT IN.

03:39.880 --> 03:41.745
LOOK, I-I KNOW
THIS IS AWKWARD.

03:41.780 --> 03:43.748
BECAUSE WE USED TO--
YOU KNOW,

03:43.790 --> 03:45.542
AND THEN YOU LEFI'
AND CAME BACK,

03:45.590 --> 03:48.081
AND WE NEVER REALLY--
YOU KNOW, SO...

03:48.120 --> 03:49.382
YEAH, WELL, IT COULDN'T BE
ANY MORE AWKWARD

03:49.430 --> 03:50.749
THAN IT IS
RIGHT THIS SECOND, SO...
I KNOW, RIGHT?

03:50.790 --> 03:52.155
THAT'S WHY I FIGURED
I WOULD JUST COME IN HERE

03:52.190 --> 03:53.748
AND--AND PUT IT
ALL OUT THERE.

03:53.800 --> 03:55.529
LUKE, I'M A GOOD COP.

03:56.600 --> 03:59.569
I'VE WORKED U.C.,
GANGS, UH, SERIAL OFFENDERS.

03:59.600 --> 04:01.795
I DON'T THINK
IT'S GONNA WORK.

04:01.840 --> 04:03.967
WHY NOT?
IT'S NOT THE RIGHT FIT.

04:04.010 --> 04:05.204
WHAT ARE YOU--

04:06.280 --> 04:08.999
COME ON. I-I'M READY
FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY.

04:09.040 --> 04:10.200
YOU PUT A CHALLENGE
IN FRONT OF ME,

04:10.250 --> 04:12.377
I'M GONNA RISE UP.

04:12.420 --> 04:13.876
(sighs)

04:13.920 --> 04:15.615
LUKE, COME ON, PLEASE.

04:15.650 --> 04:17.538
I JUST--I NEED
A CHANGE OF SCENE.

04:17.590 --> 04:19.888
THAT'S KIND OF
THE PROBLEM, ISN'T IT?

04:19.920 --> 04:21.478
LAST COUPLE MONTHS,
IT'S NOT LIKE YOUR JOB

04:21.520 --> 04:22.885
HAS BEEN YOUR
NUMBER ONE PRIORITY.

04:22.930 --> 04:24.329
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

04:24.360 --> 04:26.396
MY JOB MEANS EVERYTHING TO ME.

04:26.430 --> 04:28.159
RIGHT.

04:28.200 --> 04:31.294
WHAT? SAM?
YOU'RE REFERRING TO SAM?

04:31.330 --> 04:32.536
HE'S NOT AN ISSUE.

04:32.570 --> 04:33.992
LOOK, AN DY, REGARDLESS,

04:34.040 --> 04:36.907
I'VE GOT A CITY FULL OF COPS
THAT GOT THEIR APPLICATIONS IN

04:36.940 --> 04:38.532
AS SOON AS THEY HEARD
ABOUT THIS.

04:38.570 --> 04:40.379
I'M SORRY.
YOU'RE JUST TOO LATE.

04:40.410 --> 04:43.174
(scoffs) OH, MY GOD.

04:43.210 --> 04:45.178
I'M THAT GIRL.

04:48.620 --> 04:49.541
THAN KS.

04:50.750 --> 04:52.718
SLEEPING NEXT TO YOUR KID IS
THE BEST FEELING IN THE WORLD.

04:52.760 --> 04:54.284
HE KEPT PATI'ING
MY FACE,

04:54.320 --> 04:56.151
"WHAT'S THIS CALLED NAME?
WHAT'S THIS CALLED NAME?"

04:56.190 --> 04:57.555
YEAH, I KNOW, I KNOW.
I HEARD.

04:57.590 --> 04:59.126
SO HOW LONG ARE THEY
THINKING ABOUT STAYING?

04:59.160 --> 05:00.593
UH, I'M NOT SURE YET.

05:00.630 --> 05:02.962
UM, DENISE DOES NOT
LIKE THE CITY,

05:03.000 --> 05:04.661
SO I'M TRYING
TO FIGURE IT OUT.

05:04.700 --> 05:06.122
IT'S A GOOD THING TIMMINS
IS ONLY AN HOUR AWAY.

05:06.170 --> 05:08.536
YEAH, BY PLANE.
SO YOU CAN GO VISIT HER
ON THE WEEKENDS.

05:08.570 --> 05:10.731
BONJOUR. QU'EST-CE QU'IL
SE PASSE?

05:10.770 --> 05:12.431
MOI, JE M'APPELLE GAIL.

05:12.480 --> 05:13.970
GAIL PECK GETS BENCHED,

05:14.010 --> 05:15.875
AND SUDDENLY THE LONELY PLANET'S
NEVER LOOKED LESS LONELY.

05:15.910 --> 05:17.138
HEY, UNTIL THEY DECIDE,

05:17.180 --> 05:18.670
I'M GONNA BE COUNTING
PAPER CLIPS BEHIND A DESK,

05:18.710 --> 05:20.143
SO I NEED TO BE ABLE
TO LOOK FORWARD TO SOMETHING.

05:20.180 --> 05:21.909
EAT, PRAY, HATE.
I LIKE IT.

05:21.950 --> 05:23.178
I DON'T.

05:23.850 --> 05:25.283
WE'LL ALWAYS
HAVE PARIS.

05:27.760 --> 05:29.182
I MEAN, NOTHING
AGAINST KIDS.

05:29.220 --> 05:31.256
IT'S CHRIS. IT'S LIKE
HE'S BEEN BODY-SNATCHED.

05:31.290 --> 05:33.349
I THOUGHT THIS WAS GONNA BE
LIKE "TWO MEN AND A BABY."

05:33.400 --> 05:36.153
INSTEAD, IT'S LIKE SOME
HORRIBLE AFTER-SCHOOL SPECIAL,

05:36.200 --> 05:38.691
EXCEPT NOBODY GETS CANCER.
NOT YET.

05:38.730 --> 05:41.494
THAT'S TRUE. THAT'S VERY
HEARTENING. THANK YOU.
(chuckles)

05:41.540 --> 05:42.905
(female dispatcher)
All call--We have a 911

05:42.940 --> 05:44.407

05:44.440 --> 05:46.579
A prisoner receiving medical
treatment has escaped custody.

05:46.610 --> 05:48.703
MARK 1521. WE'RE ON OUR WAY.

05:48.740 --> 05:50.378

We're looking

05:50.410 --> 05:52.446

05:53.450 --> 05:56.544
I'M PUTI'ING YOU FORWARD
FOR THE TASK FORCE.

05:56.590 --> 05:57.989
DON'T BE SO SURPRISED.

05:58.020 --> 06:00.284
YOU'RE A GOOD COP.
YOU'RE A GOOD DETECTIVE.

06:00.320 --> 06:02.424
EVEN WITH EVERYTHING
YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH THIS YEAR,

06:02.460 --> 06:04.348
IT'S IMPRESSIVE.

06:04.390 --> 06:05.982
I THINK YOU'D ADD
A LOT TO THE TEAM,

06:06.030 --> 06:07.349
IF YOU'RE INTERESTED.

06:07.400 --> 06:10.460
YES, I'M INTERESTED.
EVERYBODY WANTS IN ON THIS.

06:10.500 --> 06:12.593
OKAY, BUT, UH,
THERE COULD BE SOME TRAVEL.

06:12.640 --> 06:14.289
YOU MIGHT BE GONE
FOR A WHILE.

06:14.340 --> 06:16.296
HOW LONG?
I DON'T KNOW.

06:16.340 --> 06:18.308
BUT, UH, I KNOW
YOU GOT A FAMILY.

06:18.340 --> 06:21.104
BUT THIS IS A BIG DEAL.
IF WE CAN PULL THIS OFF,

06:21.140 --> 06:23.347
IT'S GONNA LOOK GOOD
ON ALL THE OFFICERS INVOLVED.

06:23.380 --> 06:25.075
THINK ABOUT IT.

06:25.110 --> 06:26.714
This is 1521.

06:26.750 --> 06:28.672

06:44.730 --> 06:48.734

06:48.770 --> 06:51.330

06:52.840 --> 06:53.977

06:54.010 --> 06:55.830
SIR?

JUST GO GET HIM.

06:55.880 --> 06:57.177

YEAH? LET ME LOOK.

07:37.450 --> 07:39.759
OH, LIKE A MILLION BUCKS.

07:39.790 --> 07:41.451
ALL RIGHT. WELL, WE JUST
FINISHED TALKING

07:41.490 --> 07:43.048
TO THE GUARD WHO WAS
A'l'I'ACKED AT ST. PAT'S.

07:43.090 --> 07:44.557
THEY WERE TAKING
JOHN GREY TO THE HOSPITAL.

07:44.590 --> 07:47.024
NOW HE SAID THAT
HE SWALLOWED RAZOR BLADES

07:47.060 --> 07:48.527
AND HE WAS SPI'I'I'ING BLOOD.

07:48.560 --> 07:50.027
SO HOW'D HE GET
THE DROP ON HIM?

07:50.070 --> 07:52.425
UH, HE GRABBED A TASER
OFF OF THIS GUARD,

07:52.470 --> 07:53.994
WAITED, USED THE TASER
ON THE SECOND GUARD

07:54.040 --> 07:55.234
OUTSIDE OF THE HOSPITAL,

07:55.270 --> 07:56.828
AND THEN THREW THIS GUY
INTO A VAN AND TOOK OFF.

07:56.870 --> 07:58.599
THINK HE WAS INVOLVED?

07:58.640 --> 08:00.437
LET'S FIND OUT.
LET'S BRING HIM IN,

08:00.480 --> 08:01.606
AND WE'LL QUESTION HIM
WHEN WE GET BACK.

08:01.640 --> 08:03.642
JOHN GREY, HUH?
TOUGH BREAK.

08:03.680 --> 08:04.977
YOU KNEW HIM?

08:05.010 --> 08:06.648
YEAH, WE ARRESTED HIM
EARLIER THIS YEAR.

08:09.020 --> 08:11.511
KEPT HER LOCKED IN A BASEMENT
FOR SEVEN YEARS.

08:15.090 --> 08:17.558
EIGHT MONTHS AGO, WE ARRESTED
OUR SUSPECT, JOHN GREY,

08:17.590 --> 08:19.319
IN THE KIDNAPPING
OF ALICE MCLEOD.

08:19.360 --> 08:21.590
CHANCES ARE HE'S HEADED
OUT OF TOWN.

08:21.630 --> 08:23.188
HE ESCAPED
FROM OUR DIVISION.

08:23.230 --> 08:24.527
WE'RE GONNA GET HIM.

08:24.570 --> 08:25.559
YEAH, WE CHECKED THE HOUSE.

08:25.600 --> 08:27.090
IT GOT SOLD
AFI'ER HE WENT TO PRISON.

08:27.140 --> 08:28.835
I'M GONNA ASSUME WE GOT OFFICERS
WATCHING THE GIRL'S HOUSE?

08:28.870 --> 08:30.963
633 ROXBOROUGH DRIVE.

08:31.010 --> 08:32.534
SHE LIVES WITH HER GRANDFATHER.

08:32.580 --> 08:34.468
NOBODY'S HOME, AND HE'S
NOT ANSWERING HIS CELL.

08:34.510 --> 08:36.478
WELL, KEEP TRYING.
WHAT ABOUT THE GUARDS?

08:36.510 --> 08:37.704
ANY CHANCE THAT
THEY'RE INVOLVED?

08:37.750 --> 08:39.911
THEY'RE BOTH IN INTERVIEW.
WE'LL KNOVé/OSCSJISJN ENOUGH.

08:39.950 --> 08:41.417
WE'VE GOT UNIFORMS
CANVASSING THE AREA

08:41.450 --> 08:43.884
OUTSIDE THE ALLEY.
ANYTHING ELSE?

08:43.920 --> 08:46.559
KNOWN ASSOCIATES.
IN PRISON, BEFORE PRISON.

08:46.590 --> 08:48.888
FAMILY, LAWYERS. ANYBODY
HE COULD HAVE TALKED TO,

08:48.920 --> 08:50.080
WE NEED TO FIND THEM.

08:50.130 --> 08:51.381
NASH, WE NEED TO GET
A BOLO

08:51.430 --> 08:53.455
TO NEIGHBORING POLICE SERVICES
AND TRAVEL OUTLETS.

08:53.500 --> 08:56.196
ALL RIGHT? AIRPORT,
BUS STATION, TRAIN STATION,

08:56.230 --> 08:57.390
RENTAL CARS.
I'M ON IT.

08:57.430 --> 08:58.966
ALL RIGHT.
LET'S GET OUT THERE.

09:05.470 --> 09:07.370
WHERE DO YOU
WANNA START?
ALICE'S HOUSE.

09:07.410 --> 09:08.399
27's ALREADY THERE.

09:08.440 --> 09:10.078
SO? IT'S NOT US.

09:14.320 --> 09:15.639
WHAT'S GOING ON?

09:15.680 --> 09:17.079
UH, JUST CHECKING
THE PREMISES.

09:17.120 --> 09:18.815
UM, STAFF SERGEANT BEST
SENT US OVER.

09:18.850 --> 09:20.181
NO SIGN OF ALICE, HUH?

09:20.220 --> 09:24.429
NOPE. WE'VE BEEN HERE...
HALF AN HOUR.

09:24.460 --> 09:25.882
NOBODY'S HOME,
NOBODY IN OR OUT.

09:25.930 --> 09:27.124
ALL RIGHT. MIND IF
WE WALK AROUND?

09:27.160 --> 09:28.752
GO AHEAD.

09:29.870 --> 09:32.122
(radio chatter)

09:32.170 --> 09:34.058
OKAY. GUESS
WE'LL START HERE,

09:34.100 --> 09:35.465
AND THEN TRY THE NEIGHBORS,

09:35.500 --> 09:36.808
SEE IF THEY SAW ANYTHING?

09:36.840 --> 09:37.932
YOU HONESTLY THINK
HE'D COME HERE?

09:37.970 --> 09:39.005
THAT'D BE INSANE.

09:39.040 --> 09:40.735
JOHN GREY COULD HAVE
GOT AWAY LAST TIME.

09:40.780 --> 09:43.772
WE ONLY CAUGHT HIM BECAUSE
HE WOULDN'T LEAVE WITHOUT ALICE.

09:43.810 --> 09:45.778
I MEAN, HE'S OBSESSED
WITH HER.

09:51.390 --> 09:52.618
HEY.

09:54.060 --> 09:55.459
WHAT? SOME PEOPLE LIKE
FRESH AIR.

09:55.490 --> 09:57.321
YEAH, IN THE SUMMERTIME.
IT'S FREEZING OUT RIGHT NOW.

09:57.360 --> 09:58.384
WHO'D LEAVE
THEIR WINDOW OPEN?

09:59.490 --> 10:00.457
OKAY.

10:02.530 --> 10:04.327
(groans)

10:04.370 --> 10:05.598
UM...

10:05.630 --> 10:06.938
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

10:06.970 --> 10:08.562
I'M GIVING YOU A BOOST.

10:30.060 --> 10:31.049
ALICE?

10:32.530 --> 10:33.929
MR. MCLEOD?

10:33.960 --> 10:36.258
(Dov) IF YOU'RE GOING IN,
YOU BETTER HURRY UP.

11:04.860 --> 11:08.591
DOOR WAS OPEN. THE SECURITY
SYSTEM'S TURNED OFF.

11:08.630 --> 11:09.619
(holsters gun)

11:11.170 --> 11:12.990
I THOUGHT ALICE
WAS HOME-SCHOOLED.

11:15.500 --> 11:16.808
WHAT TIME IS IT?

11:16.840 --> 11:18.364
1:00.

11:18.410 --> 11:22.506
"1:00 P.M.--DR. KIRIJIAN.
3:30--O.T. AT FIELDING."

11:22.540 --> 11:24.098
MAYBE SOME KIND
OF THERAPY?

11:24.150 --> 11:25.139
MAYBE.

11:28.780 --> 11:32.489
DOV, HER ENTIRE BEDROOM
IS PRISTINE EXCEPT FOR THIS.

11:32.520 --> 11:34.215
THINK HE'S BEEN HERE
ALREADY?

11:34.260 --> 11:36.216
IF HE HAS, HE KNOWS
EXACTLY WHERE TO FIND HER.

11:38.260 --> 11:39.796
(door buzzer sounds, beeps)

11:42.430 --> 11:44.227
HOW LONG YOU WORKED
IN CORRECTIONS?

11:44.270 --> 11:45.965
COUPLE OF MONTHS.

11:46.000 --> 11:47.490
HOW MUCH YOU MAKE NOW?
WHAT'S YOUR YEARLY?

11:47.540 --> 11:48.666
I DON'T HAVE TO
ANSWER THAT.

11:48.700 --> 11:50.930
IT'S OKAY.
IT'S A TRICK QUESTION.

11:50.970 --> 11:52.699
I ALREADY KNOW HOW MUCH
A CORRECTIONS OFFICER MAKES,

11:52.740 --> 11:55.607
AND I'M TELLING YOU,
IT AIN'T THAT MUCH.

11:57.180 --> 11:58.545
MUST BE TEMPTING, HUH?

11:58.580 --> 11:59.979
MAKE A LITTLE EXTRA PAYDAY?

12:00.020 --> 12:02.079
I DIDN'T HELP
THAT SCUMBALL ESCAPE.

12:02.120 --> 12:03.348
I KNOW.

12:03.390 --> 12:06.416
HE JUST SLIPPED HIS CUFFS
AND TOOK YOUR TASER,

12:06.450 --> 12:07.712
USED IT ON YOUR PARTNER,

12:07.760 --> 12:09.284
THEN FORCED YOU TO DRIVE
THE VAN WITH IT, RIGHT?

12:09.320 --> 12:11.880
DO I LOOK LIKE
I WAS IN ON THIS?

12:11.930 --> 12:14.649
YOU LOOK LIKE YOU WANT PEOPLE
TO THINK THAT YOU WEREN'T.

12:14.700 --> 12:15.826
(phone vibrating)

12:15.860 --> 12:18.021
(Luke) so HOW MUCH
DID HE OFFER YOU?

12:18.070 --> 12:19.059
(Vince) LOOK AT MY FACE.

12:19.100 --> 12:20.089
WHAT'S GOING ON?

12:20.140 --> 12:22.062
WE THINK JOHN GREY
WAS IN THE HOUSE.

12:22.100 --> 12:24.330
HOW DO YOU KNOW?
ARE YOU SURE?

12:24.370 --> 12:26.167
NO, WE'RE NOT SURE,
BUT THE BACK DOOR WAS OPEN,

12:28.140 --> 12:29.072
SO?

12:29.110 --> 12:31.476
TRACI? HER ROOM
WAS SPOTLESS.

12:31.510 --> 12:33.569
I MEAN, EXCEPT
THE BED WAS MESSED UP,

12:33.620 --> 12:35.315
AND THERE WAS
ONE PILLOWCASE GONE.

12:35.350 --> 12:36.886
WAIT--DID YOU GUYS
GO IN THE HOUSE?

12:36.920 --> 12:39.241
UH, ANY NEWS
ON THE GRANDFATHER?

12:39.290 --> 12:41.155
YEAH, YEAH. HIS SISTER SAYS
HE'S IN MEMORIAL RIGHT NOW.

12:41.190 --> 12:43.385
HE'S IN RADIATION THERAPY, SO
WE'LL TALK TO HIM WHEN HE'S OUT,

12:43.430 --> 12:45.318
BUT, GUYS, WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
LOOKING FOR JOHN GREY.

12:45.360 --> 12:48.056
NO, WE ARE. BUT WE NEED
YOUR HELP ON SOMETHING.

12:48.100 --> 12:50.159
WE'RE LOOKING FOR
A DR. KIRIJIAN.

12:50.200 --> 12:52.930
K-I-R-I-J-I-A-N.

12:52.970 --> 12:54.392
ACCORDING TO HER SCHEDULE,

12:54.440 --> 12:55.930
THAT'S EXACTLY WHERE
ALICE SHOULD BE RIGHT NOW.

12:55.970 --> 12:57.437
Okay. It could be
a family doctor.

12:57.470 --> 12:59.062
NO, I DON'T THINK SO.
IT WAS TWICE A WEEK.

12:59.110 --> 13:00.668
PROBABLY A PSYCHOLOGIST,
MAYBE A SHRINK.

13:00.710 --> 13:02.598
OKAY. THERE'S--THERE'S TWO.

13:02.640 --> 13:03.902
THERE'S A HANNAH
AND A GEORGE.

13:03.950 --> 13:07.010
HANNAH IS DOWNTOWN
AND GEORGE IS IN WOODBRIDGE.

13:07.050 --> 13:08.210
WHAT'S THE OFFICE ADDRESS
FOR HANNAH?

13:08.250 --> 13:10.980
213 ST. JOSEPH, SUITE 1504.
ANDY?

13:11.020 --> 13:13.284
YEAH, WE'RE ON OUR WAY.
(siren wails)

13:13.320 --> 13:16.653
***

13:18.960 --> 13:20.359
HAI UN...

13:20.400 --> 13:23.426
UH, COME SI DICE... COLTELLO?

13:23.470 --> 13:26.462
I DON'T WANT
TO BREAK A NAIL.

13:26.500 --> 13:28.491
SO WHAT--YOU GOING
TO ITALY NOW?

13:28.540 --> 13:30.405
(Italian accent) SUNSET
ON THE PONTE VECCHIO.

13:30.440 --> 13:33.273
CHIANTI ON
THE PIAZZA SAN MARCO.

13:33.310 --> 13:34.572
SOUNDS LIKE IT'S GONNA BE
A LONG TRIP.

13:34.610 --> 13:36.498
(normal accent) WELL, YOU CAN
COME AND VISIT ME IF YOU WANT.

13:36.540 --> 13:39.179
OF COURSE, YOU'RE NOT GONNA
BE ABLE TO RECOGNIZE ME,

13:39.210 --> 13:41.019
'CAUSE I'M GONNA BE
ABOUT 800 POUNDS

13:41.050 --> 13:42.881
AFI'ER EATING
ALL THAT PASTA.

13:44.490 --> 13:45.479
WHAT?

13:45.520 --> 13:46.612
(knife clicks)

13:46.650 --> 13:48.754
YOU DIDN'T EXPECT ME
TO STICK AROUND

13:48.790 --> 13:50.155
AND BAG GROCERIES,
DID YOU?

13:50.190 --> 13:52.897
NO. NO, OF COURSE NOT.

13:52.930 --> 13:55.854
NICK, I... I HAVE
TO DO SOMETHING.

13:55.900 --> 13:58.767
I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE IT'S
A CHANCE FOR ME TO...

13:58.800 --> 14:00.131
FIND MYSELF.

14:00.170 --> 14:01.694
I'D NEVER HOLD YOU BACK
FROM DOING THAT.

14:01.740 --> 14:04.208
I'M JUST...

14:04.240 --> 14:05.161
JUST THINKING ABOUT US.

14:06.210 --> 14:09.998
YEAH, WELL, US IS FINE,
'CAUSE US IS AMAZING.

14:10.050 --> 14:11.642
WE ARE, RIGHT?

14:11.680 --> 14:13.477
WHAT'S A LITTLE TIME APART?
RIGHT?

14:13.520 --> 14:16.148
WE'LL BE FINE.
OF COURSE WE WILL.

14:16.180 --> 14:17.784
I'LL MISS YOU.

14:18.920 --> 14:20.410
I'LL MISS YOU, TOO.

14:21.690 --> 14:24.158
COLLINS, COME ON. WE'RE GOING TO
VISIT JOHN GREY'S JAIL BUDDY.

14:24.190 --> 14:26.420
YES, SIR. JUST LET ME
GET MY STUFF.

14:30.770 --> 14:31.725
HEY.

14:35.540 --> 14:36.859
(chuckles)

14:52.350 --> 14:53.612
SO JOHN GREY.

14:53.660 --> 14:55.878
YOU SPENT THREE MONTHS
IN A CELL WITH THE GUY.

14:55.920 --> 14:59.185
THEN TODAY, HE SWALLOWS
A RAZOR BLADE,

14:59.230 --> 15:01.027
OR MAYBE HE DIDN'T.

15:01.060 --> 15:03.767
EITHER WAY, AUTOMATIC
HOSPITAL VISIT.

15:03.800 --> 15:05.665
WOULD YOU HAVE ANYTHING
TO SAY ABOUT THAT?

15:05.700 --> 15:09.693
'CAUSE, YOU KNOW, JOHN'S NEVER
BEEN INSIDE BEFORE.

15:09.740 --> 15:12.732
SO THE RAZOR BLADE TRICK?

15:12.770 --> 15:15.773
THAT, UH, CAME FROM
A PRO, SO TO SPEAK.

15:17.810 --> 15:19.402
DO YOU KNOW WHAT HE DID?

15:19.450 --> 15:21.748
DO YOU KNOW WHY
HE WAS IN HERE?

15:21.780 --> 15:24.112
WELL, I KNOW
WHAT THEY SAY HE DID.

15:24.150 --> 15:26.038
BUT I ALSO KNOW
THAT IT'S YOUR JOB

15:26.090 --> 15:28.354
TO IMPRISON CITIZENS
WHO DISAGREE

15:28.390 --> 15:30.324
WITH THIS GOVERNMENT'S
POLITICAL AGENDA.

15:32.360 --> 15:35.295
DID HE EVER TALK
ABOUT, UH, ALICE?

15:37.030 --> 15:38.895
CAN'T HELP YOU OUT.

15:38.930 --> 15:41.763
YOUR FILE SAYS YOU WERE
IN AFGHANISTAN.

15:41.800 --> 15:43.336
ROTO ZERO.

15:43.370 --> 15:44.803
WHAT ABOUT IT?

15:44.840 --> 15:46.205
YOU ARRIVED IN KANDAHAR
WITH NOTHING.

15:46.240 --> 15:47.832
NO INFRASTRUCTURE, NO SUPPORT.

15:55.320 --> 15:56.514
WE DUG OUR OWN TRENCHES.

15:56.550 --> 15:58.415
SO AT LEAST WE HAD
A PLACE TO SLEEP.

15:58.450 --> 16:00.259
I KNOW.

16:00.290 --> 16:01.450
YOU'RE A HERO.

16:02.990 --> 16:04.389
NOT ANYMORE.

16:05.490 --> 16:07.355
LOOK, YOU MAY NOT
TRUST THIS UNIFORM,

16:07.400 --> 16:08.856
BUT IT'S TRUE.

16:09.960 --> 16:11.860
NOW YOUR OLD CELLMATE,
HE ABDUCT ED A LITTLE GIRL.

16:11.900 --> 16:13.436
KEPT HER IN HIS BASEMENT
FOR SEVEN YEARS.

16:17.910 --> 16:20.276
THAT THING WITH THE RAZOR BLADE,
HE DID THAT.

16:22.310 --> 16:24.801
HE USED A PEN REFILL
TO SLIP HIS CUFFS.

16:24.850 --> 16:27.944
AND THAT, UH,
CORRECTIONS GUARD?

16:27.980 --> 16:31.518
THE YOUNG ONE? HE'D BE UP
FOR HELPING OUT.

16:31.550 --> 16:33.757
IF THE PRICE WAS RIGHT.

16:33.790 --> 16:34.779
ANYTHING ELSE?

16:34.820 --> 16:37.186
GREY'S GOT
A BAG ON THE OUTSIDE.

16:37.230 --> 16:40.996
IN A STORAGE LOCKER.
BS, EASTERN STORAGE.

16:41.030 --> 16:42.054
AND WHAT'S IN THE BAG?

16:43.870 --> 16:45.167
MONEY.

16:45.800 --> 16:47.199
WEAPONS.

16:48.200 --> 16:49.736
STUFF HE WOULDN'T KNOW
HOW TO USE.

16:50.870 --> 16:53.577
YOU TOLD GREY YOUR WHOLE PLAN
AND HE STOLE IT, HUH?

16:53.610 --> 16:55.134
GUARD!

16:56.280 --> 16:58.009
I WANNA GO BACK
TO MY CELL.

17:00.720 --> 17:03.780
(door buzzer sounds,
door opens)

17:03.820 --> 17:05.788
NICE WORK, COLLINS.

17:05.820 --> 17:07.310
THANK YOU, SIR.

17:18.000 --> 17:19.297
(knock on door)

17:19.330 --> 17:20.297
DR. KIRIJIAN?

17:20.340 --> 17:22.092
HERE!

17:22.140 --> 17:24.404
HI, SORRY TO BOTHER...

17:24.440 --> 17:26.032
WHAT HAPPENED? HERE.
LET ME HELP YOU UP.

17:26.070 --> 17:28.379
1521. I NEED AN AMBULANCE
TO 213 ST. JOSEPH, SUITE 1504.

17:28.410 --> 17:30.640
I'LL CLEAR THE OTHER ROOMS.
WE'RE GONNA GET YOU
TO THE HOSPITAL. OKAY.

17:30.680 --> 17:31.874
CAN YOU TELL ME
WHAT HAPPENED?

17:31.910 --> 17:34.572
UH, HE--HE BROKE IN
WHILE WE WERE TALKING.

17:34.620 --> 17:35.712
RIGHT AWAY, I KNEW
WHO HE WAS.

17:35.750 --> 17:38.241
JOHN GREY? WHAT WAS
HE WEARING?

17:38.290 --> 17:40.611
UH, A DARK JACKET...

17:40.660 --> 17:42.184
I-I DON'T KNOW.
I CAN'T THINK.
O-OKAY.

17:42.220 --> 17:43.187
DO YOU REMEMBER HIM
SAYING ANYTHING?

17:43.230 --> 17:44.185
MAYBE ABOUT WHERE
HE WAS GOING,

17:44.230 --> 17:45.424
WHERE HE WAS TAKING HER?

17:45.460 --> 17:47.496
ALL CLEAR.
HE SAID HE WAS
GOING TO KILL ME

17:47.530 --> 17:49.293
UNLESS I TOLD HIM
WHERE ALICE WAS.

17:49.330 --> 17:50.627
ALICE? I THOUGHT
ALICE WAS HERE.

17:50.670 --> 17:51.898
NO, NO. NO, NO.

17:51.930 --> 17:52.862
HER GRANDFATHER RESCHEDULED.

17:52.900 --> 17:54.231
THEY COULDN'T MAKE IT TODAY.

17:54.270 --> 17:55.737
I GAVE THE APPOINTMENT

HANG ON A SEC.

19:54.360 --> 19:55.509
IT'S THE SECURITY COMPANY.

19:55.560 --> 19:57.289

22:13.960 --> 22:16.394
HEY!

22:18.500 --> 22:19.797
NO, NO.

22:19.830 --> 22:21.138
OH!

22:21.170 --> 22:22.262
SO YOU TURNED THE ALARM OFF,

22:22.300 --> 22:24.109
AND THEN YOU LEFT
THE WINDOW OPEN

22:24.140 --> 22:25.664
SO YOU COULD SNEAK
BACK IN LATER.

22:25.710 --> 22:28.599
YEAH. BUT THEN WHEN I GOT HOME,
THERE WAS A POLICE CAR OUTSIDE.

22:28.640 --> 22:30.005

22:30.040 --> 22:32.270
THAT'S WHEN YOU SET
THE ALARM OFF?

22:32.310 --> 22:33.641

WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

22:38.650 --> 22:39.787
EVER SINCE I GOT BACK,

22:39.820 --> 22:41.287

22:41.320 --> 22:44.221
I'M 15. I JUST WANT

22:49.600 --> 22:51.090

I THOUGHT SHE WOULD BE HERE.

26:48.300 --> 26:51.007

OKAY. OKAY.

27:21.370 --> 27:23.065

OKAY? STAY CLOSE.

27:52.070 --> 27:53.526
(holsters gun)

27:53.570 --> 27:56.095
SAM, YOU DON'T HAVE
TO BE HERE. JUST GO.

27:56.140 --> 27:57.835

28:00.410 --> 28:02.503
(door clattering)

28:02.540 --> 28:05.304
POLICE! DON'T MOVE!

28:05.350 --> 28:06.703
STOP!

28:08.750 --> 28:11.048
THERE'S NOWHERE TO GO!

28:11.090 --> 28:13.217

28:13.250 --> 28:15.389
STOP RIGHT NOW!

28:15.420 --> 28:16.751
STEP FORWARD.

28:16.790 --> 28:19.088
I JUST--I JUST WANTED
TO SAY GOOD-BYE TO HER.

28:19.130 --> 28:20.586
PUT YOUR HANDS
BEHIND YOUR HEAD.

28:24.230 --> 28:25.959
TURN AROUND.

28:26.570 --> 28:28.390
I SAID TURN AROUND!

28:31.640 --> 28:33.130
ON YOUR KNEES.

28:40.250 --> 28:41.911
(radio static)
THIS IS EPSTEIN.
I'M IN THE BASEMENT.

28:41.950 --> 28:43.941
I GOT HIM.

28:43.990 --> 28:46.379
(sighs)

28:46.420 --> 28:48.308
HOW MANY BONES
ARE IN A HUMAN BODY?

28:48.360 --> 28:49.759
OKAY, AN DY--

28:49.790 --> 28:53.351
NO, NO, NO.
DO YOU KNOW OR NOT?

28:53.390 --> 28:54.891
206.

28:54.930 --> 28:57.194
206. I THOUGHT IT WAS
MORE LIKE 150,

28:57.230 --> 28:59.892
BUT I GUESS I HAVEN'T REALLY
THOUGHT ABOUT IT BEFORE.

28:59.930 --> 29:01.488
FIRST TIME YOU EVER
HELD A GRENADE?

29:01.540 --> 29:04.202
YES. (sighs)

29:04.240 --> 29:05.605
I MEAN...

29:05.640 --> 29:08.529
IT WASN'T REALLY
A GOAL OF MINE, BUT...

29:08.580 --> 29:11.401
HEY, AT LEAST IF IT'S
THE LAST THING I EVER DO,

29:11.450 --> 29:13.247
THEN IT'S A FIRST, SO...

29:14.580 --> 29:15.717
I WISH I WAS MORE
LIKE YOU.

29:15.750 --> 29:17.479

29:17.520 --> 29:19.249
I WISH YOU WERE IN MY HEAD.

29:19.290 --> 29:20.882
I WISH YOU COULD
READ MY MIND.

29:20.920 --> 29:23.286
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

29:29.660 --> 29:31.423
I LOVE YOU, ANDY.

29:32.970 --> 29:34.232

29:34.270 --> 29:36.488
(chuckles softly)

29:39.040 --> 29:40.359

30:17.680 --> 30:21.047
THIS WILL WORK BETTER IF YOU
JUST DON'T THINK ABOUT IT, OKAY?

30:21.080 --> 30:23.241
JUST LET ME DO IT.

30:25.820 --> 30:28.357
FROM WHAT I HEAR,
IT'S KINDA LIKE, UH,

30:28.390 --> 30:30.756
AFTER A PEDICURE, YOU KNOW?
(breathing nervously)

30:30.790 --> 30:33.054
WHEN YOU SLIDE
THE FLIP-FLOPS ON.

30:33.090 --> 30:35.490
(clicking softly)

30:35.530 --> 30:37.521
POLISH IS STILL WET.

30:43.370 --> 30:45.201
OKAY.

30:45.240 --> 30:47.435
SO HERE COMES
THE TRICKY PART.

30:47.470 --> 30:48.869
GOTTA LET GO.

30:48.910 --> 30:51.572
THAT'S IT?
THAT'S IT.

30:55.820 --> 30:57.776
(gasps softly)

31:00.220 --> 31:01.778
(exhales)

31:05.860 --> 31:06.929
WE'RE GOOD?

31:06.960 --> 31:08.689
WE'RE GOOD.
(sighs) ALL RIGHT.

31:08.730 --> 31:10.527
(sighing)

31:10.560 --> 31:12.562
(exhales) OH, MY GOD.

31:13.970 --> 31:15.392
(sighs)

31:19.970 --> 31:21.733
(sighs)
(door closes)

31:21.780 --> 31:23.429
WE SHOULD LET ALICE
AND HER FAMILY KNOW

31:23.480 --> 31:25.402
THAT WE GOT HIM IN CUSTODY.
I ALREADY DID.

31:25.450 --> 31:26.940
WE'RE PUTTING OFFICERS
AT THE HOUSE

31:26.980 --> 31:28.971
UNTIL HE'S
BACK IN LOCKDOWN.

31:31.290 --> 31:33.349
I THOUGHT WE WERE WAITING
FOR HIS LAWYER.

31:33.390 --> 31:35.119
TASK FORCE.

31:35.160 --> 31:37.617
I JUST GOT THE DETAILS
FROM HEADQUARTERS.

31:37.660 --> 31:39.457
AND IT JUST GOT
A LOT MORE COMPLICATED.

31:39.490 --> 31:41.594
BY COMPLICATED,
YOU MEAN DANGEROUS?

31:41.630 --> 31:43.621
THEY WANT THE TEAM
MOBILIZED BY MIDNIGHT.

31:43.660 --> 31:45.366
TONIGHT?

31:46.600 --> 31:48.989

31:49.040 --> 31:53.329
OKAY, UH... I CAN DO THIS.
I JUST NEED TO--

31:53.370 --> 31:54.871
I JUST NEED TO SET SOME
THINGS UP WITH DEX

31:54.910 --> 31:57.378
AND SAY GOOD-BYE TO LEO.

31:57.410 --> 31:59.173
YOU'RE NOT GONNA HAVE TIME.

32:01.450 --> 32:03.418
THEN I CAN'T SAY YES.

32:05.420 --> 32:07.513
I'M NOT GONNA LEAVE WITHOUT
SAYING GOOD-BYE TO MY SON.

32:07.550 --> 32:09.279
YEAH. I UNDERSTAND.

32:11.360 --> 32:14.818
IT'S OKAY. YOU HAVE SOMETHING
MORE IMPORTANT IN YOUR LIFE.

32:14.860 --> 32:17.499
OKAY? YOU'RE LUCKY.

32:24.410 --> 32:25.638
(door closes)

32:25.670 --> 32:27.137
PUT HIM ON.

32:27.170 --> 32:30.071

32:55.770 --> 32:57.237

33:21.500 --> 33:23.127
'CAUSE, DIAZ, IF YOU TRANSFER

33:23.160 --> 33:24.559
IT'S NOT GONNA BE LIKE THIS.

33:24.600 --> 33:26.227

SOMEBODY'S
BREAKING UP THE BAND.

34:02.340 --> 34:03.659

34:19.650 --> 34:20.787
NO.

34:23.060 --> 34:24.982
I MEANT IT.

34:25.690 --> 34:27.157
IT'S TRUE.

34:27.190 --> 34:28.657
THERE ARE 206 BONES
IN THE HUMAN BODY.

34:28.700 --> 34:31.021
I SAW IT ON "GREY'S ANATOMY."

34:31.060 --> 34:32.994
I'M GOING HOME.
(chuckles) COME ON.
McNALLY!

34:33.030 --> 34:34.895
YOU DON'T GET TO DO THIS

34:34.940 --> 34:37.591
I DON'T CARE IF YOU'RE SERIOUS.
I DON'T CARE IF YOU'RE JOKING.

34:37.640 --> 34:39.267
I DON'T CARE ANYMORE.
SO JUST LEAVE ME ALONE.

34:39.310 --> 34:40.538

34:40.570 --> 34:41.901
I SCREWED UP, OKAY?

34:41.940 --> 34:44.079
THINGS GOT TOUGH,
AND I WALKED AWAY.

34:45.750 --> 34:47.047
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHAT YOU PUT ME THROUGH?

34:47.080 --> 34:48.945
(sighs)
YOU BROKE UP WITH ME
IN A PARKING LOT,

34:48.980 --> 34:51.847

34:51.890 --> 34:53.585

OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU DON'T
HAVE TO DO ANYTHING, OKAY?

35:00.160 --> 35:01.923

35:08.800 --> 35:10.665
I'M GONNA TAKE OUT
YOUR GARBAGE.

35:10.700 --> 35:12.167
I'M GONNA WALK YOUR DOG.

THEN LET'S GET A DOG.

35:13.910 --> 35:15.400

35:17.510 --> 35:20.479

35:58.290 --> 35:59.848
THING HAVE CHANGED.

35:59.890 --> 36:03.189
AFTER TODAY, NOBODY'S GONNA
QUESTION ME PUTTING YOU FORWARD.

36:03.220 --> 36:04.778
BUT I HAVE TO LEAVE
TONIGHT?

36:04.830 --> 36:07.321
SOMEBODY'S GONNA MEET YOU
AT YOUR HOUSE,

36:07.360 --> 36:09.328
MAKE SURE YOUR BUSINESS
IS TAKEN CARE OF,

36:09.360 --> 36:11.464
SET UP YOUR COVER STORY.

36:11.500 --> 36:15.596
OBVIOUSLY YOU CAN'T LET
ANYBODY KNOW THAT YOU'RE GOING.

36:17.340 --> 36:19.433
BUT I FIGURE
YOU KNOW THAT.
MM-HMM.

36:21.210 --> 36:22.734
YOU CAME INTO MY OFFICE
THIS MORNING

36:22.780 --> 36:25.908
AND YOU TOLD ME YOU WOULD
RISE TO ANY CHALLENGE,

36:25.950 --> 36:27.838
THAT YOUR JOB IS
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING.

36:27.880 --> 36:29.370
I MEANT THAT.

36:29.420 --> 36:31.308
GOOD.

36:31.350 --> 36:33.944
'CAUSE I NEED YOUR ANSWER
IN FIVE MINUTES.

36:40.090 --> 36:41.990
WANT TO DO THIS
IN MY OFFICE?

36:43.260 --> 36:44.989
HERE'S FINE.

36:53.710 --> 36:55.075
(sighs)

37:02.020 --> 37:03.817
ROSS PERIK--

37:03.850 --> 37:05.647
THE GUY WHO, UH,
KIDNAPPED YOU,

37:05.690 --> 37:07.317
MURDERED THOSE GIRLS...

37:08.860 --> 37:10.418
I REMEMBER.

37:12.230 --> 37:13.857
HIS TRIAL'S IN THREE WEEKS.

37:15.060 --> 37:16.459
AND WE'RE GONNA NEED
YOUR WITNESS TESTIMONY

37:16.500 --> 37:18.149
TO PUT THE GUY WHO KILLED
JERRY AWAY FOR GOOD.

37:18.200 --> 37:20.168
YEP. I'VE COPIED
MY NOTES.

37:20.200 --> 37:22.737
I'VE GONE OVER THE TESTIMONY
WITH A PROSECUTOR.

37:22.770 --> 37:24.362
I'M REALLY READY
FOR THIS TRIAL.

37:24.410 --> 37:26.264
AND AN OFFICER WHO'S
LOST HER BADGE

37:26.310 --> 37:27.902
ISN'T GONNA LOOK GOOD
ON THE STAND.

37:27.940 --> 37:29.908
DEFENSE WILL
TEAR IT APART.

37:31.750 --> 37:33.172
WHICH MEANS WHAT?

37:34.180 --> 37:37.115
WHICH MEANS WE'RE RETURNING
YOU TO FULL DUTY.

37:37.150 --> 37:39.084
THERE'LL BE A PAY CUT,

37:39.120 --> 37:42.248
AND YOU'LL BE RIDING
WITH A T.O. AGAIN.

37:42.290 --> 37:43.848
BUT ON THE UPSIDE,
CONGRATULATIONS,

37:43.890 --> 37:46.085
YOU'RE BACK ON THE JOB.

37:46.130 --> 37:47.859
FULL DUTY, AS OF TOMORROW.

37:52.800 --> 37:54.062
(books thud)

38:06.280 --> 38:09.272
AT LEAST SHE WON'T THINK
YOU'RE TRYING TOO HARD.

38:09.320 --> 38:11.208
(laughs) COME ON.
THIS IS MY LUCKY SHIRT.

38:11.250 --> 38:12.717
I FOUND IT IN THE BACK
OF MY CAR.

38:12.750 --> 38:15.310
WELL, THEN BECCA'S
A LUCKY GIRL.

38:17.290 --> 38:21.056
(sighs) OKAY, OKAY, ALL RIGHT.

38:21.090 --> 38:23.149
I DON'T KNOW, I DON'T KNOW.

38:23.200 --> 38:25.395
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I'M DOING HERE.

38:25.430 --> 38:28.536
TRUST ME, OKAY?
THE DATING WORLD--

38:28.570 --> 38:30.060
IT'S LIKE RIDING A BIKE.

38:30.100 --> 38:31.636
IT ALWAYS HURTS
WHEN YOU FALL OFF.

38:31.670 --> 38:33.137
NO, NO. IT'S NOT THAT.

38:33.170 --> 38:35.138
ZOE. SHE CALLED ME TODAY.

38:35.180 --> 38:36.533
SHE WANTS ME TO COME HOME,
WANTS TO TRY AGAIN.

38:36.580 --> 38:38.309
(chuckles) WHAT ARE YOU
STILL DOING HERE?

38:38.350 --> 38:40.910
SHE'S DONE THIS BEFORE.
YOU KNOW, I GO BACK--

38:40.950 --> 38:42.417
SHE'S LIKE A YO-YO--
UP AND DOWN AND UP AND DOWN.

38:42.450 --> 38:43.917
AND IF I DO GO BACK AGAIN
AND SHE PUSHES ME AWAY,

38:43.950 --> 38:45.281
I'M GONNA BE LIVING WITH YOU
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.

38:45.320 --> 38:47.379
OKAY. WHAT IF SHE--WHAT IF
SHE MEANS IT THIS TIME, OKAY?

38:47.420 --> 38:49.888
DON'T WASTE A GOOD THING
BY KEEPING SCORE, MAN.

38:49.920 --> 38:52.059
SOMETIMES THE BEST THING
IS THE THING YOU HAD.

38:52.090 --> 38:54.081
GET YOUR OWN RADIO SHOW.

38:54.130 --> 38:55.757
("I Just Don't Think I'll Ever
Get Over You" playing)

38:55.800 --> 38:58.360
(Colin Hay)
* I DRINK GOOD COFFEE *

38:58.400 --> 39:00.391
SAY SORRY TO BECCA FOR ME.

39:00.430 --> 39:02.796
* EVERY MORNING *
GOOD LUCK.

39:04.370 --> 39:05.667
YOU GOOD?

39:05.710 --> 39:07.632
YEAH. I AM.

39:10.180 --> 39:11.670
NO.

39:11.710 --> 39:14.304
BUT IF SOMETHING COMES UP,
THEN I'LL JUST FIGURE IT OUT.

39:14.350 --> 39:16.477
WE'RE SENDING TWO OF YOU.

39:16.520 --> 39:18.488
WE'RE PICKING UP
YOUR PARTNER NOW.

39:18.520 --> 39:20.511
(turn signal clicking)

39:25.030 --> 39:28.454
* WITHOUT YOU HERE *

39:28.500 --> 39:31.196
* THERE IS LESS TO SAY *

39:31.230 --> 39:32.219
IT'S YOU.

39:32.270 --> 39:34.329
IT'S YOU.

39:38.340 --> 39:41.639
* DON'T WANT YOU THINKING *

39:41.680 --> 39:45.639
* I'M UNHAPPY *

39:48.310 --> 39:50.813
_* WHAT IS CLOSER *
(indistinct conversations)

39:50.850 --> 39:53.580
* TO THE TRUTH *

39:57.520 --> 39:59.659
* THAT IF I LIVED *

39:59.690 --> 40:02.989
* TILL I WAS *

40:03.030 --> 40:05.828
*102*

40:05.870 --> 40:06.894
HEY.

40:06.930 --> 40:11.833
* I JUST DON'T THINK I'LL EVER *

40:11.870 --> 40:15.271
* GET OVER YOU *

40:19.950 --> 40:22.976
WHAT, ARE YOU DRINKING
ALONE?

40:23.020 --> 40:25.147
UH, IT LOOKS THAT WAY.

40:26.520 --> 40:28.784
HAVE YOU SEEN NICK AT ALL?

40:30.490 --> 40:32.151
UH...

40:32.190 --> 40:34.954
NO. SORRY.

40:39.000 --> 40:41.093
YOU KNOW WHAT?
LET'S CELEBRATE.

40:41.130 --> 40:42.734
UNTIL NICK GETS HERE, YEAH?

40:42.770 --> 40:45.432
ALL RIGHT, BUT ONLY 'CAUSE
YOU SEEM SO LONELY

40:45.470 --> 40:47.609
AND PATHETIC HERE
BY YOURSELF.
(laughs)

40:47.640 --> 40:50.108
TELL ME AGAIN WHY
THE ROOKIES DON'T LIKE YOU.
(glasses clink)

40:50.140 --> 40:53.906
* I JUST DON'T THINK I'LL EVER *

40:53.950 --> 40:58.239
* GET OVER YOU *

40:59.290 --> 41:00.882
YOU'RE LEAVING
EVERYTHING BEHIND--

41:00.920 --> 41:02.581
YOUR WALLET, YOUR CELL.

41:02.620 --> 41:04.485
THERE'S NO E-MAILS,
NO CALLS HOME.

41:04.530 --> 41:06.384
IT'S ZERO CONTACT.

41:06.430 --> 41:09.399
REMEMBER WHY YOU'RE THERE.
YOU GOT A JOB TO DO.

41:09.430 --> 41:11.057
SO GET IT DONE.

41:11.100 --> 41:12.658
(clicks tongue)

41:12.700 --> 41:14.861
IT'S HIM.

41:14.900 --> 41:17.164
I DON'T THINK HE'S COMING.

41:17.200 --> 41:19.339
I THINK WE'RE DRINKING ALONE.

41:19.370 --> 41:21.133
YEAH.

41:23.580 --> 41:25.138
GOOD LUCK.

41:30.620 --> 41:32.611
* BUT I DON'T
WANT YOU THINKING *

41:32.650 --> 41:35.357
* THAT I DON'T GET ASKED *

41:35.390 --> 41:38.450
* TO DINNER *
(Sighs)

41:38.490 --> 41:42.256
* 'CAUSE I'M HERE TO SAY *

41:42.300 --> 41:46.964
* THAT I SOMETIMES DO *

41:47.000 --> 41:49.992
***

41:51.240 --> 41:56.405
* AND EVEN THOUGH
I MAY SOON FEEL *

41:56.440 --> 41:59.341
* THE TOUCH OF LOVE *

41:59.380 --> 42:01.814
SO READY TO SAY GOOD-BYE
TO YOUR OLD LIFE?

42:01.850 --> 42:04.273
* I JUST DON'T THINK *

42:04.320 --> 42:06.413
YEAH. I GUESS I AM.

42:06.450 --> 42:12.480
* I'LL EVER GET OVER YOU *

42:12.530 --> 42:14.521
***
