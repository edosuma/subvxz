( tires screech )

00:47.610 --> 00:49.280
Almost forgot the ring.

00:49.280 --> 00:51.280
Perfect timing.
Oh--

00:51.280 --> 00:53.450
You're beautifully dressed.

00:53.450 --> 00:54.950
A mite nervous.

00:54.950 --> 00:57.120
Well, I've never
done this before.

00:57.120 --> 00:59.350
I'll take you through
step by step.

00:59.350 --> 01:01.390
Be gentle with me.

01:01.390 --> 01:02.960
( giggles )

01:05.360 --> 01:07.090
Where'd you learn
to tie a tie?

01:07.100 --> 01:11.400
My daddy said it would come
in handy in impressing a man.

01:11.400 --> 01:12.400
Daddy was right.

01:12.400 --> 01:13.530
Uh, excuse me, folks.

01:13.540 --> 01:16.070
Uh, I'm lookin' for the wedding.

01:16.070 --> 01:17.740
Right inside.

01:19.710 --> 01:21.580
Uh, thank you very much.
You're beautiful.

01:23.250 --> 01:25.650
That's what we get for letting
C.D. handle the music.

01:25.650 --> 01:26.980
I heard that.

01:26.980 --> 01:28.550
I tried to get
the Peter Duchin band,

01:28.550 --> 01:29.580
and they're busy.

01:29.590 --> 01:30.850
Come on now.
We're late.

01:31.950 --> 01:33.290
( sighs )

01:33.290 --> 01:35.690
This is it.

01:35.690 --> 01:36.760
Whew.

02:14.200 --> 02:15.800
Well, you ready
to get hitched, Hoss?

02:15.800 --> 02:17.360
She finally roped me,
Cordell.

02:17.370 --> 02:20.770
It's just a good thing
my dress is permanent press.

02:20.770 --> 02:23.140
Had him at the altar
twice before,

02:23.140 --> 02:24.900
but then duty called.

02:24.910 --> 02:27.310
Well, you know what they say.
Three's the charm.

02:50.300 --> 02:53.300
Now that Hoss
is tying the knot, Washoe,

02:53.300 --> 02:55.470
how long are you gonna be
dragging your feet?

02:55.470 --> 02:57.440
( chuckles )

02:57.440 --> 03:00.770
Well, I think I'll drag my feet
a while longer, Uncle Ray.

of my first wedding.

03:34.440 --> 03:35.780
Did you honeymoon
in Hawaii?

03:35.780 --> 03:38.140
No. We caught the King

06:44.370 --> 06:45.830
That's a girl.

06:45.830 --> 06:47.730
I can see that.

06:50.940 --> 06:52.310
Boy, she's beautiful,
Walker.

06:53.340 --> 06:55.410
I can see that too.
Now, cuff her.

06:55.410 --> 06:57.680
Yeah. Right.

07:12.460 --> 07:14.230
Um...

07:14.230 --> 07:17.260
Now, look, I did not know
that you were a girl.

07:17.270 --> 07:18.270
Now you do!

Come on!

You...

07:44.390 --> 07:45.930
Whew, man.

07:45.930 --> 07:47.490
I can't believe
Trigger,

07:47.500 --> 07:49.230
going to all
this trouble for me?

07:49.230 --> 07:50.460
Don't kid
yourself, Axel.

07:50.470 --> 07:52.730
If those rangers had taken
your lights out back there,

07:52.730 --> 07:54.730
Trigger would be selling
tickets to your wake.

07:54.740 --> 07:56.940
Well,
then who sprung me?

07:56.940 --> 07:59.010
Trigger's been running point
since I left.

08:01.080 --> 08:03.080
Come on, who?

08:03.080 --> 08:04.440
It was Katt.

08:04.450 --> 08:06.510
What?

08:06.520 --> 08:08.680
She busted me out, and you
let me leave her back there?

08:08.680 --> 08:09.980
Listen,

08:09.980 --> 08:12.080
Trigger's the one
you ought to be worrying about.

08:12.090 --> 08:13.420
He was gonna let you rot.

08:13.420 --> 08:16.590
Yeah.
So now they got Katt.

08:16.590 --> 08:17.890
Come on, chill.

08:17.890 --> 08:19.930
Look, use your head.

08:19.930 --> 08:22.730
Katt's got the goods on Trigger
for that beef in New Orleans.

08:22.730 --> 08:25.430
Now, he's gonna be freakin'
that she's gonna testify.

08:25.430 --> 08:26.830
So, what are you saying?

08:26.840 --> 08:28.230
So, what am I saying?

08:28.240 --> 08:31.370
I'm saying this is your chance
to take back the crew.

08:31.370 --> 08:33.970
Crew don't mean jack
without her.

08:36.610 --> 08:40.809

That's an M-16.

Louisiana.

08:46.990 --> 08:49.490
Axel Tate,
the prisoner they broke loose,

08:49.490 --> 08:51.620
worked as a civilian employee
there.

08:51.630 --> 08:53.090
Feds say that he was
the inside man

08:53.090 --> 08:55.190
on an arms smuggling ring.

08:55.200 --> 08:57.100
He got busted
for speeding through Denton.

08:57.100 --> 08:59.870
That's when the felony warrant
came up.

08:59.870 --> 09:01.570
Judge was signing
his extradition order

09:01.570 --> 09:03.070
when the wedding
was interrupted.

09:03.070 --> 09:04.670
Okay,
so how does she figure?

09:04.670 --> 09:06.770
The only prior pulled up
was a possession charge,

09:06.780 --> 09:08.170
where she got time served.

09:08.180 --> 09:09.610
We're still not sure,

09:09.610 --> 09:11.610
but the feds seem to think
she knows something.

09:11.610 --> 09:13.210
She's wanted
as the material witness

09:13.210 --> 09:14.450
at the trial in New Orleans.

09:14.450 --> 09:15.820
Okay,
wait a minute.

09:15.820 --> 09:17.150
What?

09:17.150 --> 09:19.050
Every time you serve
coffee and sweet rolls,

09:19.050 --> 09:20.590
there's always a catch.

09:20.590 --> 09:22.720
Walker,
you're so cynical.

09:22.720 --> 09:24.590
It's a gift.

09:24.590 --> 09:25.760
"Order of extradition.

09:25.760 --> 09:28.090
The witness will hereby
be transported--"

09:28.100 --> 09:29.430
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Time out!

09:29.430 --> 09:31.460
Now, see, I-- First of all,
I can't go.

09:31.470 --> 09:33.070
A certain employee
of the county and I

09:33.070 --> 09:36.040
are going away on vacation this
weekend to Cancun for two days.

09:36.040 --> 09:37.840
I'm using
my frequent flyer miles.

09:37.840 --> 09:39.540
So that means sunset walks
on the beach,

09:39.540 --> 09:42.380
cold margaritas, hold the salt,
thank you very much.

09:42.380 --> 09:44.440
You mean Trisha said yes?

09:44.450 --> 09:46.280
After two months of saying no.
And second,

09:46.280 --> 09:47.980
I wouldn't get on a plane
with this woman

09:47.980 --> 09:49.350
if you paid my way
to law school.

09:49.350 --> 09:50.750
I wouldn't get on a plane
with her

09:50.750 --> 09:51.950
if you paid off
my Trans-Am.

09:51.950 --> 09:53.620
I'd rather have
a root canal done.

09:53.620 --> 09:54.650
You see this?

09:54.660 --> 09:56.160
You see?
I'm sorry, James.

09:56.160 --> 09:57.720
This takes top priority.

09:57.730 --> 09:58.790
Oh, counselor--

09:58.790 --> 10:00.530
She's testifying
against Jinks.

10:02.660 --> 10:04.060
Trigger Jinks?

10:04.070 --> 10:05.500
The one and only.

10:05.500 --> 10:08.200
When did he
get out of Huntsville?

10:08.200 --> 10:09.500
Year ago.

10:09.500 --> 10:11.570
Federal mandate.
Overcrowding.

10:11.570 --> 10:13.240
They cut a dime
off his sentence.

10:13.240 --> 10:15.010
Who is Trigger Jinks?

10:15.010 --> 10:16.940
He's the guy that killed
Elton Jenner.

10:16.950 --> 10:18.410
The Ranger captain?

10:18.410 --> 10:20.680
He's the one
that broke me in.

10:20.680 --> 10:23.550
Elton busted Jinks for
gun-running back in '80.

10:23.550 --> 10:25.790
They found him shot in the back
with a .44

10:25.790 --> 10:27.950
while Jinks was out on bail
awaiting trial.

10:27.960 --> 10:30.060
Same caliber as Jinks' gun,

10:30.060 --> 10:33.360
but they never found a weapon
or a witness.

10:33.360 --> 10:36.000
So Jinks only went down
for smuggling?

10:36.000 --> 10:37.960
Exactly.

10:37.970 --> 10:40.630
So let's get this gal to
New Orleans so she can testify

10:40.640 --> 10:43.140
and put him
behind bars for good.

10:44.440 --> 10:46.710
Hey, look at
the bright side:

10:46.710 --> 10:49.910
a flight to New Orleans, you get
more frequent flyer points.

10:50.810 --> 10:52.210

11:01.660 --> 11:02.920
Ah, damn!

11:02.920 --> 11:04.990

11:04.990 --> 11:06.990
Whoo!

11:07.500 --> 11:09.130
Oh-ho-ho!

11:13.300 --> 11:14.800
Hey.

11:14.800 --> 11:17.670
Someone plan a war
and didn't invite me?

11:17.670 --> 11:18.870
( chuckles )

11:18.870 --> 11:21.240
Hey,
when'd you get sprung?

11:21.240 --> 11:22.710
Katt got me out.

11:22.710 --> 11:24.010
Katt? Really?

11:24.010 --> 11:26.310
Yeah. She got nailed
by the Texas Rangers doing it.

11:26.310 --> 11:28.720
Yeah. How come I didn't hear
about this?

11:28.720 --> 11:30.380
( laughs )

11:31.750 --> 11:34.090
Since when do we have to
run things by you?

11:34.090 --> 11:36.660
Since I got
elected president.

11:37.690 --> 11:38.990
That's bull.

11:38.990 --> 11:40.560
This was
my daddy's crew.

11:40.560 --> 11:42.630
And when he died,
he left it to me.

11:42.630 --> 11:45.200
No, that's bull,
you little piece of crap.

11:45.200 --> 11:46.470
Guess what.

11:46.470 --> 11:49.470
I am changing the will.

11:49.470 --> 11:51.900
You better back
the hell off, Trigger.

11:51.910 --> 11:53.570
I'm warning you, man.
Oh, yeah?

11:53.570 --> 11:56.480
Hey, come on, boys.
Tell him who's in charge.

11:58.480 --> 12:00.410
Montez?

12:00.420 --> 12:03.050
Gurgin?

12:04.220 --> 12:06.450
Nobody?

12:07.990 --> 12:09.460
TRIGGER:
Huh, nobody?

12:11.460 --> 12:13.730
You just lost
the inheritance, kid.

12:13.730 --> 12:16.000
It seems
I got the soldiers,

12:16.000 --> 12:18.330
and I got the toys.

12:18.330 --> 12:20.600
Any questions?

12:21.340 --> 12:22.670
No.

12:22.670 --> 12:24.070
No, what?

12:25.040 --> 12:27.470
No, sir.

12:28.810 --> 12:30.080
Good.

12:31.150 --> 12:32.680
Good.

12:33.850 --> 12:37.380
Well, we got some business
to do.

12:37.390 --> 12:40.290
The crew had been
a little top-heavy.

12:40.290 --> 12:43.160
I say we cut personnel.

12:43.160 --> 12:44.290
Like who?

12:44.290 --> 12:47.490
Like a certain little twist
with long nails,

12:47.500 --> 12:48.830
long legs up to here,

12:48.830 --> 12:50.900
mouth that won't stop.

12:50.900 --> 12:52.500
Look...

12:52.500 --> 12:55.930
I guarantee she's
not gonna testify.

12:57.970 --> 12:59.240
You're right.

13:00.510 --> 13:03.210
'Cause I'm carving her name
on a tombstone.

13:03.210 --> 13:06.380
And if you are
extra good-- Hm?

13:06.380 --> 13:08.850
I'll let you watch.

13:08.850 --> 13:10.350
(<i> ominous theme playing</i> )

13:17.760 --> 13:18.990
Thank you.

13:21.630 --> 13:23.130
All right, Miss Prather,
let's go.

13:23.130 --> 13:24.130
We're gonna take a trip.

13:24.130 --> 13:25.430
Nope.

13:25.430 --> 13:27.130
WALKER:
I guess you didn't hear the man.

13:27.140 --> 13:29.370

28:13.290 --> 28:14.790
attempted carjacking

28:14.790 --> 28:16.790
and kidnapping
and attempted murder?

28:16.790 --> 28:18.720
It'll put Trigger away
for good.

28:18.730 --> 28:20.790
If he doesn't
put us away first.

28:20.800 --> 28:22.790
Well, we just can't
let that happen.

28:27.630 --> 28:29.700
I'd feel a whole lot easier

28:29.700 --> 28:31.600
if we weren't sitting
like the meat in a sandwich

28:31.610 --> 28:32.910
a hundred miles from nowhere,

28:32.910 --> 28:34.340
with a woman marked for death.

28:34.340 --> 28:37.240
Well, if it was easy,
anyone would do it.

Aw, come on,
get out of there.

29:06.070 --> 29:07.470
Damn it, they jumped.

29:10.110 --> 29:11.380
Check those
other box cars.

29:11.380 --> 29:14.350
Trigger's gonna go
ballistic.

29:24.460 --> 29:25.460
Ow!

29:25.460 --> 29:26.630
Ow! Ow!

29:26.630 --> 29:27.630
Let me
take a look.

29:27.630 --> 29:28.890
Ow.
Walker.

29:32.630 --> 29:35.530
I think I sprained it
running for the train.

29:35.540 --> 29:37.640
All right, I'm gonna
cut you loose.

29:37.640 --> 29:40.640
But I want a "cross my heart
and hope to die" promise

29:40.640 --> 29:42.240
that you're not gonna
try and bolt on me.

29:42.240 --> 29:43.570
I swear to God.

29:43.580 --> 29:44.910
How bad is it?

29:44.910 --> 29:47.550
It's bad.

29:47.550 --> 29:49.250
I am so sorry,
you guys.

29:49.250 --> 29:50.750
That's okay.

29:50.750 --> 29:53.320
All right,
here's what we're gonna do.

29:53.320 --> 29:55.790
You take Katt
and get to Bridgeton.

29:55.790 --> 29:57.260
I'll stay behind.

29:57.260 --> 29:59.890
If Trigger tries to follow,
I'll slow him down.

29:59.890 --> 30:01.390
Here. Take this.

30:01.400 --> 30:02.760
Okay?

30:02.760 --> 30:04.730
Good luck.

30:04.730 --> 30:05.830
Is he kidding?

30:05.830 --> 30:08.270
Trigger and his men
are armed.

30:08.270 --> 30:09.940
I wouldn't want to be
in their shoes either.

30:09.940 --> 30:10.970
Come on.

30:12.240 --> 30:13.270
Yeah.

30:13.270 --> 30:14.570

30:14.580 --> 30:16.210
They're not here.
<i> Not there.</i>

30:16.210 --> 30:17.910
I thought that train
didn't stop

30:17.910 --> 30:19.110
between here
and Holtsville.

30:19.110 --> 30:20.110
They must have
jumped.

30:20.110 --> 30:23.320
You find where
they jumped off.

30:23.320 --> 30:24.420
If you don't,

30:24.420 --> 30:26.190
I'll take care
of you, instead.

30:26.190 --> 30:27.790
You blew it,
my friend.

30:27.790 --> 30:31.020
But this cat ain't
gonna have nine lives.

This time,
it is my turn.

(<i> suspenseful theme playing</i> )

30:40.300 --> 30:42.730
Yo.

30:42.740 --> 30:43.800
They're headed east.

30:43.800 --> 30:45.440
Going right through there.

30:45.440 --> 30:47.470
Okay.
We'll leave the truck here.

30:47.470 --> 30:49.110
Let's go.

30:53.580 --> 30:56.380
Listen, I heard you
talking to Trigger.

30:56.380 --> 30:59.080
This is that Indian Ranger,
Walker, right?

30:59.090 --> 31:00.950
I heard a lot
of bad stuff about him

31:00.960 --> 31:02.050
from guys
in the joint,

31:02.060 --> 31:03.460
him being
part Indian and all.

31:03.460 --> 31:04.820
Oh, is that right?

31:04.830 --> 31:06.090
Then maybe you want
to stay here.

31:06.090 --> 31:07.190
Tell them
campfire stories

31:07.190 --> 31:08.360
to Trigger
when he gets here.

31:08.360 --> 31:09.730
Now, let's get moving.

31:14.270 --> 31:15.500
( grunting )

31:30.280 --> 31:32.680
Let me
ask you something.

31:36.590 --> 31:38.360
What's the valedictorian
of her class

31:38.360 --> 31:41.530
doing with a slug
like Axel Tate anyway, huh?

31:43.460 --> 31:46.730
You don't
want to know.
Actually, I do.

31:46.730 --> 31:48.370
I kinda have
this thing about people

31:48.370 --> 31:49.870
that I'm on the run with.

31:51.270 --> 31:53.300
(<i> heartfelt theme playing</i> )

31:53.310 --> 31:56.340
I, um...
I grew up nearby.

31:57.810 --> 31:59.880
I never knew my dad.

31:59.880 --> 32:01.980
My mama left.

32:01.980 --> 32:03.750
I was raised
by my granny.

32:03.750 --> 32:04.980
That the picture
in the locket?

32:06.090 --> 32:08.050
I saw it
when we were on the train.

32:08.060 --> 32:10.920
Yeah.

32:10.930 --> 32:12.820
She always wanted
the best for me.

32:12.830 --> 32:13.830
She used to always say,

32:13.830 --> 32:18.200
"Baby, chase your dreams."

32:18.200 --> 32:20.470
She raised me to believe

32:20.470 --> 32:22.330
that I could do
whatever I wanted to do.

32:22.340 --> 32:24.070
So, what happened
to college?

32:24.070 --> 32:25.070
Granny got sick.

32:25.070 --> 32:27.270
Medical insurance
ran out.

32:27.270 --> 32:30.270
She was too proud
for welfare.

32:30.280 --> 32:33.280
We needed money for
her medical attention.

32:33.280 --> 32:36.050
So, um...

32:36.050 --> 32:37.950
Along comes Axel.

32:39.090 --> 32:41.850
And he said
I could make 20 grand easily

32:41.860 --> 32:44.360
just by carrying
this little package.

32:44.360 --> 32:45.990
So you were a courier.

32:45.990 --> 32:47.660
Just once.

32:49.300 --> 32:51.300
Once is all it took.

32:51.300 --> 32:55.070
After that, Trigger and his crew
owned me.

32:57.300 --> 33:00.140
Axel was gonna
help me get out.

33:00.140 --> 33:01.740
That's why
I sprung him.

33:01.740 --> 33:04.180
We were gonna
run away together,

33:04.180 --> 33:05.240
start again.

33:05.250 --> 33:07.050
It's never too late.

33:10.580 --> 33:12.550
So you ready to go?

33:14.490 --> 33:16.760
( whispers ):
Yeah. Let's go.

33:21.430 --> 33:23.800
(<i> ominous theme playing</i> )

33:25.570 --> 33:27.830
Looks like
they went this way.

33:31.240 --> 33:32.300
( gasps )

33:44.180 --> 33:46.580
I think we got
about three more miles.

33:46.590 --> 33:47.590
Can you make it?

33:47.590 --> 33:48.890
KATT:
Yeah. Yeah.

33:48.890 --> 33:51.090
I can make it.

33:52.760 --> 33:54.430
You know...

33:54.430 --> 33:55.930
I've kicked you,

33:55.930 --> 33:58.600
I've scratched you,

33:58.600 --> 34:00.330
and if I could've
gotten your gun,

34:00.330 --> 34:02.530
I'm sure
I would've shot you.

34:02.540 --> 34:04.540
So why?

34:04.540 --> 34:06.840
Let's just say I agree
with your granny.

34:06.840 --> 34:08.310
I think
you're worth saving.

How's that
for an excuse?

give you the heebie-jeebies?

I had an uncle
that ran a funeral home.

34:48.350 --> 34:51.350
I used to hide every time
we had to go visit him.

34:51.350 --> 34:53.050
I was always afraid
that them dead folks

34:53.050 --> 34:55.150
he was working on
in the back room,

34:55.159 --> 34:58.090
would rise up
and start walking towards me.

I mean, Vern?

Vern? Vern?
What are you trying to do?

35:03.660 --> 35:05.300
Raise the dead?

35:05.300 --> 35:08.030
I think they're already up.
Something's happened to Vern.

35:08.030 --> 35:09.670
He's gone.
Gone?
What do you mean, gone?

35:09.670 --> 35:11.770
Gone. Gone.
What's "gone" mean?

35:11.770 --> 35:13.000
He was there,
then he wasn't...

35:13.010 --> 35:15.070
Something's happened to him.

35:15.070 --> 35:18.510
Listen, he either got lost,
or he chickened out on us.

35:18.510 --> 35:19.780
I wouldn't want to be
in his shoes

35:19.780 --> 35:21.010
when Trigger gets
ahold of him.

35:21.010 --> 35:22.110
Now, let's go.

35:24.180 --> 35:26.180
(<i> mysterious theme playing</i> )

35:59.950 --> 36:01.320

Jamaica.

Jamaica?
Why Jamaica?

taught me

growing up in Baltimore.

Middle of winter.

the pipes would go out.

in the bedroom,

36:31.320 --> 36:32.350
you could see
your breath.

36:33.550 --> 36:36.320
"think of someplace
warm you'd rather be."

36:36.320 --> 36:38.990
For me it was
Ocho Rios, Jamaica.

With Bob Marley.
All right.

No, no.

of himself.

42:17.600 --> 42:19.530
Save 'em for Trigger.

42:19.530 --> 42:21.170
He'll be back
any minute.

42:21.170 --> 42:23.470
All right,
in the cell.

42:23.470 --> 42:25.400
In the cell.

42:38.850 --> 42:41.590
( door opens )

42:44.360 --> 42:47.630
Well, well.

42:47.630 --> 42:50.360
( chuckles )

42:50.360 --> 42:52.860
You know what?

42:52.870 --> 42:54.870
It is just a shame...

42:54.870 --> 42:56.870
I gotta do you,

42:56.870 --> 42:59.840
before I've even had the chance
to sample the goods.

43:01.680 --> 43:03.680
How about it, Axel?

43:03.680 --> 43:05.010
Is she as good
as she looks?

43:05.010 --> 43:06.380
Hm.

43:06.380 --> 43:08.910
Don't even
think about it.

43:11.350 --> 43:13.320
Bye-bye, baby.

43:42.550 --> 43:44.820
This is for
Elton Jenner.

43:44.820 --> 43:46.250
Remember him?

43:48.920 --> 43:50.250
I do.

43:59.630 --> 44:01.670
( groaning )

44:12.680 --> 44:15.680
New Orleans,
here I come.

44:15.680 --> 44:16.950
Yeah.

44:16.950 --> 44:20.480
You know, we made so many stops
on this journey.

44:20.490 --> 44:22.820
We got one more.

44:22.820 --> 44:25.820
(<i> heartfelt theme playing</i> )

44:35.600 --> 44:37.940
WOMAN:
Who's this?

44:40.110 --> 44:41.140
Hello?

44:41.140 --> 44:43.110
Who's there?
Can I help you?

44:43.110 --> 44:45.710
Evening, Miss Prather.

44:49.420 --> 44:51.950
MISS PRATHER:
Are you lost?

44:56.420 --> 44:59.960
Oh. Katherine.

44:59.960 --> 45:01.060
It's Katherine.

45:01.060 --> 45:03.390
My-- My baby.

45:03.400 --> 45:05.430
Lord, you done answered
my prayers. It's Katherine.

45:06.770 --> 45:07.830
KATT:
Grandma.

45:07.830 --> 45:09.530
Let me look at you.

45:09.540 --> 45:11.100
Oh, Katherine,
is you hurt?

45:11.100 --> 45:13.700
No, I'm fine.

45:14.870 --> 45:17.040
You know, Katt was asking me
why we do what we do.

45:17.040 --> 45:20.880
I told her it was
because I hate bullies.

45:20.880 --> 45:23.380
But I think this is why
we really do it, huh?

45:27.690 --> 45:29.090
Yeah.

45:33.130 --> 45:35.490
I now pronounce you
man and wife.

45:35.500 --> 45:36.590
You may kiss the bride.

45:36.600 --> 45:38.160

45:38.160 --> 45:40.530
♪ Treat me
Like a fool ♪

45:40.530 --> 45:42.330
Fourth time's
the charm, Hoss.

45:43.540 --> 45:45.440
Oh, thank you.

45:45.440 --> 45:46.900
Congratulations.
Thank you.

45:46.910 --> 45:48.210
Good luck,
honey.
Thank you.

45:49.510 --> 45:54.180
Okay, come on, girls!
Come on!

45:54.180 --> 45:57.650
That means you, Alex.
You're single.

45:57.650 --> 45:59.150
What's the matter,
chicken?

45:59.150 --> 46:02.220
Remember, I'm a great outfielder
in softball.

46:02.220 --> 46:05.190
Guys, if she doesn't
want to go out--

46:05.190 --> 46:06.820
Come on, Alex,
let's go.

46:06.830 --> 46:08.660
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

46:08.660 --> 46:11.400
Is everybody ready?
Okay.

46:12.000 --> 46:15.130
Oh! Ho, ho, ho!

46:16.040 --> 46:19.540
Ho, ho, ho!

46:19.540 --> 46:21.140
Get them
20 horses ready, son.
