00:02.001 --> 00:03.254
Previously on Arrow...

00:03.420 --> 00:06.549
<i>Four years ago,
The Hood took down Justin Claybourne.</i>

00:06.715 --> 00:07.967
You told me that Claybourne
didn't have any kids.

00:08.175 --> 00:10.348
There's no record of the kid's name.
He'd be about 30 today.

00:10.552 --> 00:12.646
Just old enough to put on
a hood and a mask.

00:12.846 --> 00:16.441
Old enough to want revenge on the man
who murdered his father.

00:17.601 --> 00:19.103
Evelyn? Why?

00:19.269 --> 00:22.864
You're a fraud.
This city needs to be saved from you.

00:23.023 --> 00:24.070
<i>He'!-</i>

00:24.274 --> 00:25.571
<i>Johnny, I need you
to come to the Safe House.</i>

00:25.734 --> 00:27.953
<i>- Something's wrong with J.J.
- Lyla?</i>

00:28.445 --> 00:29.742
Did you find Billy?

00:30.948 --> 00:33.121
<i>I didn't know it was Billy,
I couldn't have known.</i>

00:38.622 --> 00:39.623
Hi, Ollie.

00:45.629 --> 00:46.755
I saw you die.

00:47.214 --> 00:51.560
I was saved. I saw this white light and...

00:52.928 --> 00:55.477
It's... It's just like they say.

00:55.806 --> 01:00.437
This angel, she reached out to me,
but she wasn't an angel.

01:02.771 --> 01:04.068
She was my sister.

01:04.230 --> 01:05.403
What?

01:05.566 --> 01:09.867
Sara, she had me teleported
to the <i>Waverider.</i>

01:10.571 --> 01:13.996
They have this technology
that fixed the embolism.

01:14.199 --> 01:15.997
I was there.

01:17.578 --> 01:19.046
Everyone was there.

01:19.329 --> 01:22.833
Nobody saw a white light,
and you didn't go anywhere.

01:23.083 --> 01:24.676
That's because she hadn't done it yet.

01:26.128 --> 01:27.550
Ollie...

01:28.505 --> 01:30.257
Ollie, I asked her.

01:30.591 --> 01:32.434
I asked her to bring me to your present.

01:34.928 --> 01:36.726
She gave me the same gift that I gave her.

01:41.393 --> 01:42.986
She gave me a second chance.

01:43.437 --> 01:44.689
It's a miracle.

01:53.739 --> 01:54.740
Laurel?

01:55.532 --> 01:56.533
Hi, Felicity.

01:56.742 --> 01:59.211
Laurel? Oh, my God!

01:59.953 --> 02:02.206
on, my God!

02:04.207 --> 02:05.208
It's a miracle.

02:05.375 --> 02:07.048
Oliver said the exact same thing.

02:15.385 --> 02:18.059
I thought Sara and the Legends
were against changing history.

02:18.555 --> 02:22.059
Sara said that they figured out a way
to bring me back without causing a, uh...

02:22.309 --> 02:23.686
An Aberration?

02:23.894 --> 02:25.237
Yes, that.

02:26.980 --> 02:28.197
Are you okay?

02:28.899 --> 02:29.900
Fine.

02:30.859 --> 02:33.237
Yeah, I just wished the Legends
could bring back everybody we wanted.

02:35.989 --> 02:37.741
What happened? What did I miss?

02:37.908 --> 02:39.455
We'll talk about it later.

02:40.202 --> 02:43.456
The important thing is
that you're back from the past.

02:43.914 --> 02:45.791
Which they brought you back
from months later,

02:45.999 --> 02:47.717
and they just dropped you here.

02:47.959 --> 02:49.381
So weird.

02:50.420 --> 02:52.889
Time travel, am I right? Wow.

02:54.174 --> 02:55.551
Do you guys want coffee?

02:55.759 --> 02:58.137
I am gonna get a decaf,
probably, 'cause...

02:58.762 --> 03:00.856
It's nice to see some things
haven't changed.

03:02.557 --> 03:04.355
Ugh. I have to call my dad.

03:05.060 --> 03:06.858
He's gonna kill me for coming here first.

03:07.062 --> 03:08.905
Laurel, after you...

03:12.067 --> 03:16.413
Your dad left with Donna
and it didn't go well.

03:17.614 --> 03:19.616
- He's drinking again.
- He's in rehab.

03:19.950 --> 03:23.375
But, he's getting better.
He's getting the help that he needs.

03:23.620 --> 03:24.963
Wow. Nine months.

03:25.414 --> 03:27.087
I guess I have a lot of catching up to do.

03:27.999 --> 03:30.297
Which is why I'm going to
tell everyone to come to the party.

03:31.503 --> 03:32.550
What party?

03:32.754 --> 03:34.472
The party that we're gonna throw
for Laurel tomorrow night.

03:34.631 --> 03:35.803
That sounds great.

03:37.092 --> 03:39.561
I mean, I would love to see everyone.
Thea and John...

03:39.761 --> 03:41.354
Oh, my... John! Oh...

03:41.638 --> 03:43.140
I came here to tell you
and I totally forgot.

03:45.183 --> 03:46.685
What's going on with John?

03:47.269 --> 03:48.612
I can't believe she's back.

03:49.187 --> 03:51.986
I walked into the bunker,
and she was just there.

03:52.149 --> 03:56.655
Like nothing had happened.
Like it was some kind of gift.

03:57.154 --> 03:58.781
How much does she know
about what's happened?

04:00.407 --> 04:01.454
We're easing her in.

04:01.908 --> 04:04.081
There's a lot to process. The recruits...

04:04.327 --> 04:05.374
Prometheus.

04:05.579 --> 04:07.001
The fact that you killed his dad.

04:10.292 --> 04:12.386
Felicity and Lyla are working on
finding his mother.

04:12.544 --> 04:14.091
What happened with the dude
who trained the two of you?

04:15.338 --> 04:19.184
Well, she doesn't stay
in one spot for very long.

04:19.426 --> 04:21.349
But, I'm working on finding her.

04:21.595 --> 04:25.520
In the meantime, we need to work
on a way of getting you out of here.

04:25.849 --> 04:28.352
Yeah, well, we did that, remember?

04:29.060 --> 04:30.687
And here I am, right back on the inside.

04:30.854 --> 04:33.073
- Well, John...
- No, man. No more running.

04:33.315 --> 04:36.285
It's time I faced this head on,
and fight these trumped-up charges.

04:36.526 --> 04:37.869
That's an improvement from last time.

04:38.111 --> 04:39.158
Roger that.

04:39.362 --> 04:42.582
I'm gonna show Walker that he picked
the wrong soldier to screw with.

04:42.824 --> 04:44.201
We need to have some kind of plan.

04:44.659 --> 04:46.377
I'm gonna need one hell of a lawyer.

04:47.037 --> 04:48.038
I might know a guy.

04:59.883 --> 05:02.261
My captains warned me
that you would be a risk.

05:03.261 --> 05:04.433
An American Bratva?

05:06.723 --> 05:08.396
But I thought that you could be useful.

05:09.059 --> 05:11.232
I did what you asked me to do.

05:11.478 --> 05:13.572
I tried to blow up Kovar's casino.

05:14.147 --> 05:17.617
All that you were interested in
was killing Konstantin Kovar.

05:17.901 --> 05:19.619
But not for the Bratva.

05:22.656 --> 05:25.580
For yourself. For a woman.

05:26.076 --> 05:27.419
Kovar told me everything.

05:27.577 --> 05:30.456
Kovar is a government agent.

05:30.747 --> 05:34.092
And the deal that you made with him
betrays the Bratva.

05:34.251 --> 05:36.049
<i>Your vendetta betrays the Bratva.</i>

05:36.294 --> 05:38.717
My deal with Kovar
benefits our brotherhood.

05:38.964 --> 05:41.763
And, in any case, I am Pakhan.

05:42.259 --> 05:44.182
My decisions are the law.

05:45.595 --> 05:47.814
And I will get obedience from you,

05:48.849 --> 05:50.601
even if I have to beat it into you.

06:00.277 --> 06:02.075
ls this why you joined Bratva?

06:04.281 --> 06:05.658
To get to Kovar?

06:06.908 --> 06:09.957
Because you had some promise to her?

06:10.704 --> 06:12.832
Hmm?

06:16.585 --> 06:19.839
You don't have to drop everything
and fly home, Thea.

06:20.088 --> 06:22.557
I'll still be here
when the conference is over.

06:22.716 --> 06:24.810
And the way Oliver describes it,

06:25.010 --> 06:28.105
you're the one that's doing all the
heavy lifting at the mayor's office.

06:28.305 --> 06:32.151
I guess spontaneous resurrection
is as good as any reason for a party.

06:32.392 --> 06:33.393
But...

06:33.560 --> 06:37.781
But we haven't even buried
Detective Malone yet.

06:38.523 --> 06:40.241
It feels weird to be celebrating?

06:40.442 --> 06:42.194
It doesn't feel weird to you?

06:42.402 --> 06:44.075
Yes, weird, yeah.

06:44.905 --> 06:48.250
Weirder. I guess.

06:48.950 --> 06:51.794
After the past four years it's just
hard for me to accept good news.

06:56.499 --> 06:59.844
It's weird, man. She was dead.
Now she's not.

07:00.128 --> 07:01.471
Well, that's time travel for you.

07:01.713 --> 07:04.512
Well, I don't mean Laurel being back
is what's weird.

07:04.799 --> 07:07.643
It's how you all reacted to it.
Like it's happened before.

07:09.679 --> 07:11.101
It's happened before?

07:11.848 --> 07:14.852
The Lance sisters have a habit
of coming back to life.

07:17.270 --> 07:18.817
Wait, what?

07:22.150 --> 07:25.871
Yo, Curtis. Come back inside.
We're gonna make a toast.

07:26.780 --> 07:30.410
It doesn't feel right
to be gathered around like this.

07:32.077 --> 07:35.707
Detective Malone is dead.
Evelyn betrayed us.

07:36.665 --> 07:39.043
And Prometheus is still out there.

07:39.334 --> 07:44.010
We should be trying to find him.
Making him pay for everything.

07:54.766 --> 07:58.066
A little over a year ago,
I stood right here,

07:58.436 --> 08:01.406
and I remarked that I wished
it wasn't just the dark times

08:01.648 --> 08:02.820
that brought us together.

08:03.066 --> 08:06.036
<i>With all of the loss
that we have suffered,</i>

08:07.445 --> 08:11.200
I think it's important,
that we embrace the miracles, too.

08:12.450 --> 08:15.829
And that we remember
they are still possible.

08:18.081 --> 08:19.674
Welcome home, Laurel.

08:20.417 --> 08:21.543
Cheers.

08:32.886 --> 08:33.933
Hey.

08:34.681 --> 08:35.933
"Sorry?
"God!

08:36.182 --> 08:38.309
I wasn't expecting anyone here. It's late.

08:38.559 --> 08:41.313
I don't sleep much. Or at all.

08:41.604 --> 08:43.698
Side-effect of wearing haunted rags,
I guess.

08:43.940 --> 08:46.284
So, I figured I'd train. What's that?

08:46.818 --> 08:49.947
- It's nothing.
- It's my Qmail.

08:50.196 --> 08:52.119
You know, my Face-Chat, Snapbook stuff.

08:52.323 --> 08:54.451
All the kids are doing these
new, crazy social media things...

08:54.784 --> 08:57.913
- You're running a DNA analysis.
- Yeah, lam. On Laurel's glass.

08:58.621 --> 09:00.965
That... What, you took from the party?

09:01.124 --> 09:04.298
Oh, if by "party" you mean
my brilliant ruse to collect her DNA,

09:04.461 --> 09:05.929
then, yes, you are correct.

09:06.713 --> 09:08.135
- Wow.
- Yeah.

09:08.339 --> 09:10.717
You know, there's looking a gift horse
in the mouth and then there's...

09:10.884 --> 09:11.976
Being driven by paranoid delusions

09:12.177 --> 09:13.645
to run comparisons on genetic base pairs?

09:13.803 --> 09:15.146
- Yes, I'm aware. Thank you.
- Yeah?

09:15.388 --> 09:17.186
Yeah. Yeah.

09:17.724 --> 09:19.647
- Well?
- DNA matches.

09:20.852 --> 09:23.480
- Okay, so, we can relax, Shapeshifter.
- Yeah.

09:23.938 --> 09:25.815
Ooh, what about an evil twin?

09:26.983 --> 09:29.486
Oh. No.

09:29.652 --> 09:30.699
Okay, I was joking.

09:30.987 --> 09:34.036
No. No, no, no, no, no.
She actually has an evil twin.

09:34.491 --> 09:35.993
- Seriously?
- Yeah. She's locked up in S.T.A.R. Labs.

09:36.159 --> 09:37.581
I'll explain later.
Right now we have to call Cisco...

09:46.503 --> 09:48.676
Finally!
It's about time someone figured it out.

09:48.880 --> 09:53.852
You know, I am so sick and tired
of playing this weak, vulnerable Laurel.

09:54.177 --> 09:56.225
She's such a pill. It's pathetic.

10:07.357 --> 10:10.236
You know, the one problem with my ability

10:10.443 --> 10:14.073
is that I can never hear
my poor little victims scream.

10:19.119 --> 10:20.371
Laurel!

10:31.381 --> 10:33.304
Hey, are you hurt?

10:33.633 --> 10:34.930
I'm gonna be okay. But...

10:36.553 --> 10:38.055
That's not our Laurel.

10:45.645 --> 10:48.239
So, that Laurel's from
an alternate reality?

10:48.606 --> 10:50.904
Technically, she's from
a parallel universe.

10:51.151 --> 10:52.243
We're on Earth-1.

10:52.443 --> 10:54.696
The lookalike Laurel
is from another Earth, Earth-2.

10:54.904 --> 10:57.248
Over there, we all have doppelganger
versions of ourselves

10:57.407 --> 10:59.159
who could be very similar
or incredibly different

10:59.367 --> 11:00.744
based on an infinite amount of variables.

11:00.952 --> 11:02.704
I'd love to see what I'm like
on Earth-2.

11:02.996 --> 11:04.919
Oh, God! What if I'm straight?

11:05.165 --> 11:07.167
Okay. One thing I don't get...

11:07.417 --> 11:09.545
Well, you know,
there's a list of things I don't get,

11:09.752 --> 11:12.471
but the top is, this fake Laurel
seemed to know, like, everything.

11:12.672 --> 11:14.424
- How's that possible?
- Prometheus.

11:14.674 --> 11:17.723
Cisco just sent this over.
It is from three days ago.

11:17.927 --> 11:20.430
<i>Nobody knew
because no alarms were tripped.</i>

11:20.638 --> 11:22.060
It's like he's a dybbuk.

11:22.265 --> 11:23.357
Yeah, I don't know what that is.

11:23.558 --> 11:25.310
- One question.
- Just one?

11:25.518 --> 11:28.442
Prometheus breaks into S.T.A.R. Labs,
gets not-Laurel,

11:28.646 --> 11:30.865
Henry-Higgins her into coming off
as real-Laurel.

11:31.357 --> 11:33.485
That's a lot of hoops.
Why not just kill you?

11:33.651 --> 11:34.698
He told me he doesn't want to.

11:34.861 --> 11:36.955
He's proving to me
that I will destroy myself

11:37.155 --> 11:38.327
and everyone close to me.

11:38.823 --> 11:40.325
Well, he's gonna be disappointed,

11:40.533 --> 11:42.911
because we are gonna put Black Siren
back in her cage.

11:43.953 --> 11:45.296
"Black Siren"?

11:45.455 --> 11:46.923
Every meta gets a nickname.

11:47.123 --> 11:48.124
Let's hit the streets.

11:48.291 --> 11:50.510
She is not leaving the city
until this is over.

11:50.793 --> 11:51.794
What are you gonna do?

11:52.003 --> 11:54.802
John needs my help as mayor.
I will be on my cell.

11:59.219 --> 12:00.812
Let's see if I understand.

12:01.137 --> 12:02.605
You carried this girl with you

12:02.805 --> 12:06.275
through all of your trials
and tribulations on some island.

12:06.684 --> 12:08.152
- Lian Yu
- Yes.

12:08.770 --> 12:11.193
And yet, when you get off this island,

12:11.397 --> 12:13.115
you do not return home.

12:13.650 --> 12:14.822
No.

12:15.026 --> 12:19.657
Instead, you come to a country
where you know just one person,

12:19.906 --> 12:23.831
you join my organization,
pass all of our tests,

12:24.035 --> 12:29.508
and all of this so you can avenge
the death of a different woman?

12:30.166 --> 12:32.544
Woman in that photo's name is Laurel.

12:32.835 --> 12:34.758
And I didn't return home

12:35.004 --> 12:39.350
because after everything
I've been through,

12:41.427 --> 12:43.270
everything I've done,

12:46.182 --> 12:47.855
she wouldn't recognize me.

12:48.768 --> 12:50.145
Now I see.

12:50.687 --> 12:52.689
You think that you've been made
into a monster?

12:53.022 --> 12:54.990
Better a monster than a sell-out.

12:56.859 --> 12:59.988
How much did Kovar pay you
to betray your brothers?

13:18.298 --> 13:20.721
Your failure is unacceptable.

13:20.967 --> 13:22.093
You should have let me kill them

13:22.343 --> 13:24.471
instead of some stupid role-playing idea.

13:27.598 --> 13:30.192
It is not your place
to question my agenda.

13:30.393 --> 13:34.068
Your freedom, your life is contingent
on following my orders.

13:34.314 --> 13:35.987
Do you understand?

13:37.900 --> 13:39.493
Hey, thanks for coming in.

13:39.902 --> 13:42.621
No problem.
I wanted to talk with you as well.

13:42.905 --> 13:44.748
Okay. Uh, the file that I sent you...

13:44.907 --> 13:48.457
John Diggle is my former bodyguard.
And current friend.

13:48.745 --> 13:52.170
And facing a court-martial
for espionage, murder,

13:52.415 --> 13:55.794
escaping a federal prison,
and attempted theft of a WMD.

13:56.044 --> 13:57.091
He's innocent.

13:57.420 --> 13:58.592
So why did he escape a federal prison?

13:58.796 --> 14:00.423
Because he's innocent.

14:00.673 --> 14:02.266
The man who framed him
is a three-star General.

14:02.467 --> 14:06.097
John did not think that he would
get a fair trial in the court system.

14:06.304 --> 14:07.931
Which is where you come in.

14:08.181 --> 14:11.481
Oliver, I'm a city prosecutor,
not a military defense attorney.

14:11.684 --> 14:13.106
That's why I thought of you.

14:13.269 --> 14:15.613
John needs someone outside
of the military infrastructure.

14:15.897 --> 14:18.150
This is the only way
for justice to get done.

14:18.399 --> 14:21.118
- He doesn't even know me.
- John Diggle is a good man.

14:22.278 --> 14:24.531
He's better than the both of us
put together.

14:25.114 --> 14:26.286
Getting the Judge Advocates

14:26.449 --> 14:28.793
to even authorize me
to pro hac in would be a miracle.

14:29.494 --> 14:30.495
Sounds like a "yes."

14:30.661 --> 14:33.164
Eh, more like a, God, help me.
And your friend.

14:33.456 --> 14:35.299
Hey, I will owe you one.

14:35.500 --> 14:36.797
This is worth more than one.

14:37.251 --> 14:43.304
Um, actually, hey... As if we don't have
enough on our plate,

14:43.466 --> 14:45.389
have you heard about the circumstances

14:45.551 --> 14:46.848
surrounding the death of Detective Malone?

14:48.554 --> 14:49.555
No.

14:49.764 --> 14:52.517
He was wearing Prometheus' outfit
when he was killed.

14:52.725 --> 14:55.729
His mouth was taped shut,
a sword taped into his hand.

14:55.895 --> 14:57.738
There was a wireless speaker
found on the scene.

15:00.149 --> 15:01.196
What are you saying?

15:01.359 --> 15:03.327
That it looks like Malone was set up.

15:03.528 --> 15:06.702
That it looks like the Green Arrow
was manipulated into killing him.

15:07.907 --> 15:09.284
By Prometheus.

15:09.492 --> 15:11.915
I made sure the cops who caught the scene
won't say anything,

15:12.078 --> 15:14.251
and I'm handling the coroner.
I just wanted to let you know.

15:14.455 --> 15:17.379
Yeah, that you're gonna cover this up?

15:17.708 --> 15:18.834
If the city finds out

15:19.043 --> 15:21.171
that a member of the Anti-Crime Unit
was Prometheus,

15:21.379 --> 15:22.471
there's gonna be panic.

15:22.672 --> 15:25.516
If the Green Arrow killed a member
of the Anti-Crime Unit,

15:25.842 --> 15:27.185
there's gonna be panic.

15:27.427 --> 15:29.270
- Either way.
- Gotta keep this quiet.

15:29.554 --> 15:31.773
It's the only way to see justice done.

15:41.691 --> 15:42.738
This is Mayor Queen.

15:44.026 --> 15:45.573
Oliver, it's me. Laurel.

15:45.736 --> 15:47.204
Don't you say her name.

15:47.447 --> 15:49.996
I'm sorry. What I did was unforgivable.

15:50.199 --> 15:52.497
But, but he made me do it. Prometheus.

15:53.703 --> 15:55.171
What do you mean, he made you?

15:55.371 --> 15:58.750
He threatened to kill me.
You have to help me. Please.

15:59.709 --> 16:00.710
Can you meet?

16:01.335 --> 16:02.382
Where?

16:02.628 --> 16:04.881
The Black Canary statue.
I'll be there soon.

16:05.256 --> 16:06.303
Wait...

16:10.678 --> 16:12.180
<i>Any sign of Black Siren?</i>

16:12.597 --> 16:15.817
Not yet. But everyone's
gonna stand down and do not engage...

16:15.975 --> 16:17.022
Yeah, we get it.

16:17.185 --> 16:18.357
Yeah, well, I say take her down.

16:18.561 --> 16:19.562
Overwatch.

16:19.770 --> 16:22.865
You heard the boss.
This is an eyes-only operation for you.

16:23.065 --> 16:24.157
I have eyes on.

16:25.651 --> 16:27.073
Boys, I just put you
on a separate channel.

16:27.236 --> 16:28.237
Uh, why?

16:28.404 --> 16:30.498
So, if Black Siren looks like
she's about to double-cross,

16:30.656 --> 16:31.748
and trust me, she will,

16:31.908 --> 16:33.330
you have it on my authority
to light her up.

16:34.243 --> 16:36.120
Thank you for meeting me.

16:36.370 --> 16:39.749
You don't believe me.
Prometheus threatened to kill me.

16:40.208 --> 16:42.210
You're a very convincing liar.

16:42.418 --> 16:43.670
I deserve that.

16:43.920 --> 16:45.467
According to S.T.A.R. Labs,

16:45.755 --> 16:48.429
you'd help Prometheus
even if he wasn't threatening anyone.

16:48.591 --> 16:50.093
That's what they think.

16:50.301 --> 16:51.302
What do you think?

16:52.929 --> 16:54.522
I can help you track him.

16:55.598 --> 16:56.770
Take her out.

17:23.792 --> 17:25.339
I told you not to engage.

17:25.627 --> 17:26.971
We know, it's just...

17:27.213 --> 17:28.886
She, um, spooked us.

17:29.465 --> 17:30.717
You guys are terrible liars.

17:31.676 --> 17:32.973
I told them to move on her.

17:35.805 --> 17:37.682
Since when are they taking orders
from you?

17:37.848 --> 17:40.317
I don't know. But I kind of like it.

17:40.643 --> 17:42.862
- She had something in her hand.
- She had her phone in her hand.

17:43.020 --> 17:44.943
Well, it didn't look like her phone,

17:45.147 --> 17:46.444
and I don't trust her,
so I told them to move.

17:46.649 --> 17:47.901
I had the situation under control.

17:48.067 --> 17:50.786
She told me that
Prometheus forced her to do this.

17:50.987 --> 17:52.079
Now whether or not that is true,

17:52.280 --> 17:53.782
she was going to give us
valuable intel on him.

17:53.990 --> 17:55.367
She's playing you, Oliver.

17:55.575 --> 17:57.077
I understand that you're
suspicious of her.

17:57.285 --> 17:59.754
And I know this Laurel
is from another Earth,

17:59.954 --> 18:03.424
that this is not our Laurel.
But we don't know why.

18:04.417 --> 18:05.418
We don't.

18:12.633 --> 18:15.853
I told you. Blinders.

18:19.181 --> 18:20.478
<i>HEY. Wu good'?</i>

18:21.517 --> 18:23.110
Why wouldn't <i>I</i> be?

18:23.352 --> 18:25.446
I just got my ass kicked
for the bazillionth time.

18:30.693 --> 18:33.697
So, basically, I'm trading a cell
in Central City

18:33.946 --> 18:36.199
for a cell in Starling City.

18:36.407 --> 18:38.705
Actually, on this Earth,
we call it "Star City."

18:40.870 --> 18:42.213
I'm sorry about the cell.

18:43.205 --> 18:45.799
I told you
that Prometheus was going to kill me.

18:45.958 --> 18:47.960
And that is why I did what I did.

18:48.127 --> 18:51.677
Your history on Earth-2
would suggest you had other reasons.

18:51.881 --> 18:54.054
- You don't trust me?
- Can you blame me?

18:54.383 --> 18:58.138
No. Because on my world,
you've been dead for 10 years now.

18:58.346 --> 19:00.815
<i>I moved to Central City for</i> a <i>fresh start.</i>

19:01.307 --> 19:02.934
That's where this happened.

19:04.018 --> 19:08.649
And from then,
it was just one bad choice after another.

19:09.398 --> 19:11.400
And I guess
once you let the darkness inside,

19:11.609 --> 19:12.826
it never comes out.

19:13.069 --> 19:15.538
And now I am trapped
in a parallel dimension,

19:15.738 --> 19:17.911
telling my sob story

19:18.240 --> 19:21.244
to the doppelganger of the man that...
That I loved.

19:21.994 --> 19:23.871
So stop running.

19:25.331 --> 19:26.924
Face the darkness.

19:27.583 --> 19:28.926
How does that work?

19:29.502 --> 19:32.756
First, you need to tell me
everything that you know about Prometheus.

19:33.130 --> 19:34.256
<i>Everything.</i>

19:34.548 --> 19:36.346
And then we keep you safe.

19:37.093 --> 19:39.016
And you're willing to do that, why?

19:40.137 --> 19:42.356
Why, because I look like someone
you used to know?

19:42.598 --> 19:44.646
Someone once told me that a circumstance

19:44.850 --> 19:49.196
could make something poison or nectar.

19:52.400 --> 19:56.280
What they meant was
that we get to choose what we are.

19:56.487 --> 19:58.956
<i>We get to choose who we are.</i>

19:59.740 --> 20:01.742
So tell me...

20:05.454 --> 20:06.455
Who are you?

20:10.084 --> 20:11.586
Hey, yo, hold up!

20:11.752 --> 20:13.925
I'll walk with you. Hopping the L-line.

20:14.130 --> 20:16.132
- You taking the subway?
- No, I'm just gonna walk.

20:16.340 --> 20:17.842
BY Yourself?

20:18.092 --> 20:20.561
You do have a tendency
to get your ass kicked.

20:21.137 --> 20:23.139
Did you just come all the way
out here just to insult me?

20:23.389 --> 20:25.391
I'm just going home,
but that was merely a product of...

20:25.641 --> 20:26.813
I'll see you tomorrow, Rene.

20:27.268 --> 20:28.815
Damn, you soft!

20:29.019 --> 20:30.646
I thought you had some wit, man.

20:30.855 --> 20:32.232
What, the Black Siren kicked that
out of you, too?

20:32.440 --> 20:33.737
Not now, man. Not now.

20:34.400 --> 20:36.198
What, did I hurt your feelings?

20:36.444 --> 20:38.446
Just let me be, man.

20:39.697 --> 20:41.415
What's your damage, hoss?

20:41.615 --> 20:43.743
I mean, ever since the party,
you've been off.

20:43.993 --> 20:45.995
You're supposed
to be the happy one, remember?

20:46.245 --> 20:48.168
Like what? Like this?

20:48.581 --> 20:49.833
What the hell's gotten into you?

20:49.999 --> 20:52.218
I've been stabbed, shot at, put in a coma,

20:52.501 --> 20:54.219
had magic powers used on me,

20:54.420 --> 20:56.422
superpowers used against me, and for what?

20:57.673 --> 20:59.550
What difference does it make?

21:00.426 --> 21:03.851
All it's done is cost me my blood,
my sweat...

21:06.015 --> 21:07.358
And my Paul.

21:08.309 --> 21:09.686
It cost me Paul.

21:12.188 --> 21:13.861
That's your husband, right?

21:14.190 --> 21:17.285
Was. He left me.

21:18.027 --> 21:19.700
'Cause of you being Mr. Terrific?

21:23.199 --> 21:24.291
Because of me trying.

21:25.910 --> 21:30.086
But I'm never gonna make it,
because I don't have what it takes.

21:31.415 --> 21:33.213
So now I don't have anything.

21:44.470 --> 21:48.850
Hey, keep your wrist straight.
Just so you don't jam it.

21:50.351 --> 21:51.523
Mmm.

21:52.394 --> 21:56.444
- I spoke to Laurel.
- When did she become Laurel?

22:00.653 --> 22:04.499
She's not Laurel. Not Laurel Laurel.
She's not our Laurel, okay? Not...

22:04.657 --> 22:09.208
Okay, Felicity, I can't pretend
to understand parallel worlds.

22:09.787 --> 22:12.085
But if I'm gonna believe in them,

22:12.248 --> 22:15.798
and I kind of have to now,
then I need to believe

22:16.001 --> 22:18.754
that differences
are caused by circumstances.

22:18.921 --> 22:23.222
So why can't we change
this Laurel's circumstances?

22:23.425 --> 22:24.517
You think that you can save her.

22:26.929 --> 22:30.149
- After she's thrown in with Prometheus...
- Under duress.

22:33.143 --> 22:34.269
I just...

22:35.229 --> 22:37.323
I think I can reach her.

22:37.523 --> 22:40.276
When did you find the time
to get a PhD in psychology?

22:40.442 --> 22:41.819
I'm a quick study.

22:43.237 --> 22:46.958
My name's Adrian Chase,
Star City District Attorney.

22:47.992 --> 22:52.122
John Diggle. Convict.
You here to add to my charges?

22:52.830 --> 22:55.253
Not exactly. I'm representing you.

22:56.584 --> 23:00.805
Your friend Oliver's persuasive.
Plus, he's my boss.

23:02.298 --> 23:05.051
General Walker,
the guy who wants you out of the picture,

23:05.301 --> 23:09.477
- you know who his boss is?
- The President.

23:09.722 --> 23:11.975
So you can imagine how difficult
this is about to be.

23:13.809 --> 23:17.655
Mr. Chase, MP officers are here to remand
the prisoner into their custody.

23:17.855 --> 23:20.199
Wait, I thought
I was supposed to stay here for now.

23:20.399 --> 23:22.572
You're under their jurisdiction.
The trial...

23:22.776 --> 23:26.076
The trial? Man, there won't be a trial.

23:26.280 --> 23:27.327
As soon as I'm out of here,

23:27.489 --> 23:29.412
Walker will concoct some reason
to put a bullet in my head.

23:32.453 --> 23:34.251
Sergeant Diggle.

23:34.413 --> 23:36.006
Good to see you again.

23:37.082 --> 23:40.211
Have Sergeant Diggle cleared out of here
and ready for transport ASAP.

23:41.086 --> 23:43.930
We got a long ride back
to Langham ahead of us.

24:10.366 --> 24:15.088
So tell me,
what happened between you and Oliver?

24:16.705 --> 24:20.835
Did he find someone else?
Or were you not tall enough?

24:22.044 --> 24:27.050
Do you have a sister?
Because I hear he loves sisters.

24:30.260 --> 24:33.890
Oliver seems to think that
because you look like Laurel,

24:34.098 --> 24:35.395
that you could become her.

24:37.893 --> 24:39.315
And what do you think?

24:40.938 --> 24:42.440
I think...

24:44.900 --> 24:46.493
You should get used to living in cages.

24:48.779 --> 24:51.532
There's a part of him
that blames himself for Laurel's death.

24:53.242 --> 24:54.539
It's who he is.

24:55.869 --> 24:57.667
So when he looks at you,

24:59.832 --> 25:01.300
he doesn't just see Laurel.

25:03.961 --> 25:05.679
He sees his shot at redemption.

25:06.463 --> 25:11.264
Wow, it must be really frustrating
that he doesn't listen to you.

25:11.468 --> 25:12.685
No, I'm used to it.

25:37.369 --> 25:38.416
How'd she escape?

25:38.579 --> 25:40.877
The power went off
and the dampener along with it.

25:41.123 --> 25:43.717
And Goldilocks huffed and puffed
and blew the door down.

25:43.959 --> 25:45.802
That's not exactly how her power works.

25:46.086 --> 25:47.963
Was there something wrong
with Cisco's specs?

25:48.172 --> 25:50.345
Because didn't we just replicate
the Pipeline's security system?

25:50.549 --> 25:53.598
We did. I let her go.

25:54.970 --> 25:56.597
- What?
- Damn, blondie.

25:56.805 --> 25:59.399
I'm sorry. But, everyone, just relax.
I put tracking nanites in her water,

25:59.600 --> 26:02.228
- the same ones we used to find Malcolm.
- Well, that makes everything better.

26:02.478 --> 26:04.981
Isn't that exactly how you used Anarky
to find Darhk last year?

26:06.648 --> 26:11.324
- Could we have the room please?
- Seriously? This is getting good.

26:11.528 --> 26:13.656
Rene, Rory, come on, guys.

26:23.791 --> 26:24.838
You could've been hurt.

26:25.292 --> 26:27.260
What ever happened to
"if we change her circumstances"?

26:28.670 --> 26:33.016
You risked your life to get a line
on Prometheus because of Billy.

26:33.217 --> 26:35.766
Well, now that you're killing again,
I thought why not put it to use?

26:36.011 --> 26:38.059
You know,
we're gonna get justice for Billy.

26:38.263 --> 26:41.062
But first,
we need to take care of your ex.

26:41.266 --> 26:43.018
Who's not even your ex.

26:57.825 --> 27:01.045
<i>There's a part of him
that blames himself for Laurel's death.</i>

27:02.538 --> 27:03.539
<i>It's who he is.</i>

27:04.498 --> 27:09.345
<i>So when he looks at you,
he sees more than just Laurel.</i>

27:09.837 --> 27:12.181
<i>He sees his shot at redemption.</i>

27:15.968 --> 27:18.938
It's like I said,
you know me better than almost anyone.

27:24.226 --> 27:26.820
I failed Laurel before.

27:30.232 --> 27:31.825
I can't fail her again.

27:32.359 --> 27:34.782
I don't have to
remind you that this isn't her.

27:36.363 --> 27:37.660
I know.

27:41.535 --> 27:42.752
Our Laurel's gone.

27:44.246 --> 27:46.123
She's the last chance that I have.

27:48.458 --> 27:49.584
Okay?

27:52.588 --> 27:54.261
Billy is my responsibility.

27:57.009 --> 27:58.602
And we will get justice for him.

28:00.637 --> 28:03.390
I'll let you know
when the trackers metabolize and go live.

28:14.484 --> 28:17.704
You've been here for just few months
and already you think you know everything.

28:17.946 --> 28:20.540
Did it not occur to you
that I could be playing Kovar?

28:21.491 --> 28:24.540
- I don't believe that.
- Of course, you don't.

28:25.370 --> 28:27.338
Because you don't understand

28:27.539 --> 28:32.386
that circumstances are
what makes a thing poison or nectar.

28:33.795 --> 28:36.719
You believe
your fool's errand to kill Kovar

28:36.924 --> 28:41.555
because you think that you are responsible
for this darkness that's inside of you.

28:42.804 --> 28:47.526
Like a baby blaming himself for being
left out in the cold by his mother.

28:47.726 --> 28:49.228
If it weren't for that island,

28:51.980 --> 28:55.075
you would be
that harmless American douchebag

28:55.275 --> 28:57.573
that you pretended to be
in Kovar's casino.

29:01.907 --> 29:06.208
So I guess I'm just supposed to
listen to you instead?

29:08.247 --> 29:09.840
I can give you family.

29:10.624 --> 29:14.094
One that does not see a monster,
but a brother.

29:16.129 --> 29:19.884
All I'm asking in return
is your obedience.

29:24.346 --> 29:26.394
- Or else?
- Hmm.

29:31.687 --> 29:33.439
Or else...

29:36.483 --> 29:38.201
You don't leave this room alive.

29:43.699 --> 29:46.578
So Mom and Dad
are going 12 rounds upstairs.

29:46.827 --> 29:48.204
They're just having a discussion.

29:49.871 --> 29:53.921
Look, I know that I took the teasing
too far earlier.

29:55.085 --> 29:58.089
I can be an acquired taste,

29:58.338 --> 30:01.262
but I'm sorry to hear about Paul
and that I made you feel worse about it.

30:04.845 --> 30:06.472
Thanks.

30:06.722 --> 30:09.521
- That's really big of you.
- So what are you doing down here?

30:09.725 --> 30:14.071
Well, since the Black Siren's cry works on
a more powerful frequency than Laurel's,

30:14.313 --> 30:16.315
these are useless.

30:16.773 --> 30:20.403
So, I was trying to see if there was a way
to make the dampener portable

30:20.610 --> 30:23.580
- so the next time we go up against her...
- You can take her powers away.

30:23.864 --> 30:25.286
That's awesome.

30:25.824 --> 30:28.998
Yeah, well, ideas are one thing,
executing them is another.

30:29.369 --> 30:31.872
- You don't get it, do you?
- Get what?

30:32.080 --> 30:35.050
That maybe instead of beating yourself up
about what you can't do,

30:35.250 --> 30:37.093
take a moment
and appreciate what you can do.

30:38.503 --> 30:39.800
'Cause it's pretty bad-ass.

30:46.762 --> 30:48.480
General Walker. Sorry, General,

30:48.680 --> 30:51.650
but I cannot let you take John Diggle
without the proper paperwork turned in.

30:51.808 --> 30:54.778
- Excuse me?
- Forms I-55 and W-67.

30:54.936 --> 30:57.906
And the completed transfer assignment
signed by the Langham warden.

30:58.106 --> 31:01.610
Never seen a D.A. get involved in military
matters. And on the defense side.

31:02.944 --> 31:04.821
I'm expanding my practice.

31:09.326 --> 31:10.418
Anything else?

31:21.254 --> 31:23.302
It's not common for someone of your rank

31:23.465 --> 31:25.968
to personally supervise
a prisoner transfer.

31:26.176 --> 31:28.599
I make exceptions for traitors
and terrorists.

31:29.638 --> 31:32.517
I'll need a district judge
to ratify the transfer papers.

31:32.724 --> 31:35.477
That could take a few hours,
maybe even a few days.

31:35.644 --> 31:39.945
Do you have the Attorney General
on speed dial? I do.

31:40.315 --> 31:44.661
And she owes me a favor.
I can have you disbarred in 15 seconds.

31:45.821 --> 31:50.702
I expect the prisoner to be
in my custody in 24 hours. Am I clear?

31:51.576 --> 31:52.623
Mmm-hmm.

32:01.002 --> 32:02.049
Tracker's live.

32:02.212 --> 32:04.089
- Where is she?
- The nanites just metabolized.

32:04.256 --> 32:06.008
I'm triangulating them
with a keyhole satellite feed.

32:06.216 --> 32:07.763
Remind me to upgrade our Internet
tomorrow. Got it.

32:08.176 --> 32:10.770
1400 block, Brand Boulevard.
Pulling up keyhole now.

32:10.971 --> 32:12.518
I think I have something that'll help.

32:12.681 --> 32:14.979
A mobile version of the dampener
from S.T.A.R. Labs.

32:15.183 --> 32:17.151
- "Think"?
- I might need some more time with it.

32:17.310 --> 32:19.483
The circuitry is pretty complex
and I'm feeling a lot of pressure...

32:19.688 --> 32:20.940
Felicity can come with and help you.

32:21.148 --> 32:23.571
Hold up. I'm not getting a good enough
reading off the thermal imaging.

32:23.733 --> 32:25.701
There's no way to tell if Black Siren
is actually with

32:25.902 --> 32:30.157
Prometheus, and the whole point of doing
this is to catch that son of a... bitch.

32:30.365 --> 32:32.367
We need to wait until we get
visual confirmation of Prometheus.

32:32.534 --> 32:34.787
We are not waiting for anything.
We're gonna bring her in right now.

32:34.995 --> 32:36.872
Get on board with this. Suit up!

32:43.211 --> 32:46.715
This is private property.
Ma'am, what are you doing here?

32:46.965 --> 32:48.308
I'm just waiting for a friend.

32:50.719 --> 32:52.721
She's here. Create a perimeter. Go!

32:59.686 --> 33:01.188
- Did you hear that?
- Hear what?

33:01.396 --> 33:03.649
Kidding. I think people in Florida
heard that. We need to hurry.

33:05.942 --> 33:08.866
- She was crazy. She could scream.
- Run away and call the police.

33:22.626 --> 33:24.048
Don't move, Trinity.

33:24.753 --> 33:25.754
Oh.

33:26.004 --> 33:29.008
I thought you'd be someone else.
Disappointing.

33:35.180 --> 33:37.433
- This should do it.
- Are you sure?

33:37.766 --> 33:38.938
No, but we're out of time.

33:46.858 --> 33:48.110
Prometheus.

34:11.882 --> 34:14.306
Diazepam. That should slow you down.

34:30.985 --> 34:33.705
Diazepam.
You could say I have a tolerance.

34:33.947 --> 34:36.416
But you shouldn't be worrying about me
right now.

34:37.993 --> 34:39.710
Ah, Felicity.

34:41.121 --> 34:45.001
I'm so sorry, but I think it's about time
that I kill you.

34:46.501 --> 34:48.047
Felicity or me!

34:55.342 --> 34:57.345
Laurel!

35:02.851 --> 35:03.898
Don't do this.

35:05.895 --> 35:07.192
There's no coming back for you.

35:07.355 --> 35:08.982
If you kill Felicity,

35:09.190 --> 35:13.696
then you're killing that part of yourself
that existed before you lost your family.

35:17.907 --> 35:21.832
If you end this now,
we can find that person again,

35:22.996 --> 35:24.043
together.

35:24.664 --> 35:25.961
She was never there.

35:47.395 --> 35:50.069
You really need to shut your damn mouth.

35:51.191 --> 35:52.408
', Pumpkin.

35:59.574 --> 36:02.544
Hey. Kept my wrist straight.

36:14.506 --> 36:17.385
You turn me over, I'll be dead before you
get back to your office.

36:17.717 --> 36:18.934
I believe you.

36:20.595 --> 36:23.269
You know, when I woke up,
I didn't think that I'd be pissing off

36:23.431 --> 36:25.149
one of the most powerful men
in the military.

36:27.602 --> 36:28.899
Hit me.

36:29.104 --> 36:30.276
What?

36:30.438 --> 36:31.610
Hit me.

36:45.161 --> 36:48.916
- What the hell is going on here?
- Your prisoner just decked me.

36:49.124 --> 36:52.628
- Unsatisfied with your legal counsel?
- Who knows?

36:52.794 --> 36:56.298
But we are in Starling County,

36:56.464 --> 36:59.138
and the County Code Section 47.15

36:59.342 --> 37:03.313
specifically states
that the District Attorney, me,

37:03.471 --> 37:06.224
can supersede transfers
to other jurisdictions

37:06.433 --> 37:09.812
if the suspect commits a secondary crime
within my jurisdiction.

37:11.020 --> 37:14.741
Attacking a city official
is a very serious offense, Mr. Diggle.

37:15.525 --> 37:17.573
I think I'm gonna have to
prosecute this one myself.

37:19.154 --> 37:21.031
It could take a while.

37:21.322 --> 37:24.496
Fine. I'll be back with a writ
signed by the President.

37:24.784 --> 37:27.583
Can't wait.
I've always wanted her autograph.

37:43.803 --> 37:46.932
You know how people say,
"I hate to say I told you so"?

37:47.140 --> 37:49.518
I don't hate it. I freakin' love it.

37:49.726 --> 37:51.774
You really weren't kidding
about that acquired-taste thing.

37:52.020 --> 37:53.647
It's like shooting fish
in a barrel with you.

37:54.314 --> 37:55.782
It's cool. I can take it.

37:57.692 --> 38:00.036
You were right, Rene.
I need to start embracing

38:00.195 --> 38:02.948
what I can do for the team,
instead of what I can't.

38:03.198 --> 38:06.042
That's what I'm talking about.
More tinkering and less fighting.

38:06.367 --> 38:09.211
Well, I wouldn't exactly
call it "tinkering".

38:10.038 --> 38:12.006
- Oh, one more thing.
- Yeah, what's up?

38:12.207 --> 38:14.835
You put your hands on me like that
one more time, and I'll kick your ass.

38:18.630 --> 38:20.849
Oh. Good talk.

38:25.804 --> 38:29.729
God! This is why I usually leave
the punching to you guys.

38:30.016 --> 38:31.438
- It was a memorable punch.
- Mmm-hmm.

38:32.894 --> 38:37.320
Yeah, well, typing is going to be a bit of
a challenge in the next couple of days.

38:40.360 --> 38:43.614
Serves me right.
Because I let Black Siren go,

38:43.863 --> 38:45.536
one of those guards could have
gotten killed.

38:45.782 --> 38:47.034
We almost got Prometheus.

38:49.661 --> 38:51.288
Your plan worked. He was there.

38:51.454 --> 38:53.798
No, if it worked,
we'd be putting cuffs on him right now.

38:53.998 --> 38:55.295
We'll get there.

38:56.835 --> 38:57.961
We'll get him.

39:04.425 --> 39:06.393
I'm sorry she wasn't her.

39:06.594 --> 39:07.686
I know.

39:08.471 --> 39:11.850
I'm sorry about Billy. He was a good man.

39:12.976 --> 39:13.977
Like you.

39:16.896 --> 39:20.025
So I'm guessing that Laurel is
on her way back to Central City then?

39:20.275 --> 39:23.279
Secure lockup at A.R.G.U.S.
I'm keeping her close

39:23.528 --> 39:28.125
because if there is anything left
of the real Laurel in there,

39:32.662 --> 39:33.788
I'm gonna find it.

39:34.163 --> 39:35.255
You know what?

39:36.749 --> 39:39.502
I could really get used to
this new found optimism of yours.

39:48.970 --> 39:52.099
I'm done asking. Follow me or die.

39:54.475 --> 39:55.567
Find out what's happening.

40:32.972 --> 40:36.317
Hello, Mr. Queen. My name is Talia.

40:37.226 --> 40:38.648
I've been looking for you.

40:47.153 --> 40:50.532
This doesn't feel right.
They're just taking it away like this.

40:52.700 --> 40:54.748
We should build a new one.

40:55.036 --> 40:57.255
- I think we can do better.
- Yeah? What are you thinking?

40:57.538 --> 41:00.007
I haven't kept my promise to Laurel.

41:00.208 --> 41:02.506
You're gonna train a new Black Canary?

41:02.710 --> 41:06.260
I think that somewhere out there, there is
a woman worthy of Laurel's legacy.

41:10.051 --> 41:11.928
Now all we've gotta do is find her.

41:17.016 --> 41:18.689
You boys want another round?

41:20.019 --> 41:23.569
No. I was thinkin' of ordering
somethin' that's not on the menu, huh?

41:23.773 --> 41:25.400
Where you goin', baby?

41:25.608 --> 41:28.111
<i>Seriously, could you two be
any more of a cliche'?</i>

41:29.988 --> 41:34.243
Don't worry, sweetheart.
There's plenty of me to go around.

41:35.618 --> 41:38.542
I thought people like you
only existed in the movies.

41:38.746 --> 41:42.751
You know, two guys trying to
overcompensate for their lack of manhood

41:42.959 --> 41:44.757
by taking it out on a defenseless woman.

41:44.919 --> 41:45.920
What are you gonna do about it?

41:54.721 --> 41:55.813
That.
