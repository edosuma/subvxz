WEBVTT

01:24.200 --> 01:25.400
Greetings, Princess.

01:45.320 --> 01:46.960
You're my daughter, Shivangi,

01:47.800 --> 01:49.960
but do not forget that after marriage

01:50.040 --> 01:52.560
your husband's home becomes your home.

01:52.640 --> 01:56.360
You informed your in-laws
regarding your arrival, didn't you?

01:56.880 --> 01:58.600
If I wanted to inform them,

01:58.680 --> 02:00.600
I would've written two letters
and not one, Mother,

02:01.280 --> 02:03.280
but I came here to reduce my troubles,

02:03.480 --> 02:04.480
not to increase them.

02:04.920 --> 02:07.480
Sikar is not so far
from Sajjangarh, sister,

02:07.560 --> 02:09.520
that your in-laws won't hear
about your arrival.

02:09.600 --> 02:12.360
Their daughter-in-law came from London
and went straight to her father's home?

02:12.440 --> 02:14.000
They won't be happy about it.

02:14.080 --> 02:16.760
They have already lost their right
to be angry, brother.

02:17.440 --> 02:20.440
I'm worried that after hearing the truth,

02:20.960 --> 02:22.440
you might also get angry.

02:22.520 --> 02:23.520
Don't talk in riddles!

02:24.400 --> 02:26.840
You know that I don't like
beating around the bushes.

02:27.480 --> 02:28.960
She can talk only if you let her, right?

02:30.120 --> 02:32.880
Tell me what happened to the prince.

02:33.560 --> 02:36.000
Everything was fine till April 21st.

02:36.240 --> 02:39.080
Veer had appeared for the law exam.

02:39.160 --> 02:41.000
The results were going
to be declared soon.

03:05.480 --> 03:08.240
When you are

03:08.880 --> 03:11.760
with me

03:12.240 --> 03:15.320
I don't know

03:15.760 --> 03:18.960
What happens to me

03:19.200 --> 03:22.320
You make my heart flutter

03:22.640 --> 03:25.240
with the look in your eyes

03:25.480 --> 03:29.280
Where did you learn

03:29.360 --> 03:31.800
This magic trick?

03:31.920 --> 03:38.640
I'll follow you like a shadow everywhere

03:39.040 --> 03:42.160
What am I without you?

03:42.240 --> 03:45.440
Nothing at all

03:46.080 --> 03:49.240
I wish, I wish

03:49.360 --> 03:52.760
I wish, I wish

03:53.080 --> 03:59.520
Wish we may stay oblivious to the time

03:59.720 --> 04:06.240
Wish we could stay this way all our life

04:06.760 --> 04:09.960
I wish, I wish

04:10.040 --> 04:13.560
I wish, I wish

04:13.640 --> 04:15.680
I wish, I wish

04:15.760 --> 04:17.040
"Greetings, Veer.

04:17.120 --> 04:19.320
"You are not only making
Sajjangarh proud in London,

04:20.360 --> 04:21.720
"but the entire Mewar.

04:22.400 --> 04:24.480
"Today, on the day of our annual meet,

04:24.560 --> 04:26.040
"please honor us

04:26.640 --> 04:29.560
"by accepting this small gift
from our province.

04:30.160 --> 04:34.440
"Yours faithfully,
Subedar Bansari Lal Bismil."

04:34.680 --> 04:40.520
If you are with me

04:41.200 --> 04:44.400
I have no desire

04:44.480 --> 04:47.760
For anything else

04:48.000 --> 04:50.800
When you smile

04:51.560 --> 04:54.800
In front of me

04:54.920 --> 05:01.240
I'll lay my life there for you

05:01.480 --> 05:08.000
I'll follow you like a shadow everywhere

05:08.360 --> 05:11.320
What am I without you?

05:11.680 --> 05:14.000
Nothing at all

05:15.640 --> 05:18.760
I wish, I wish

05:18.840 --> 05:22.240
I wish, I wish

05:22.320 --> 05:28.960
Wish we may stay oblivious to the time

05:29.080 --> 05:34.920
Wish we could stay this way all our life

05:35.800 --> 05:39.480
I wish, I wish

05:39.560 --> 05:44.040
I wish, I wish

09:46.440 --> 09:47.560
Darling...

09:50.840 --> 09:51.840
Darling?

09:52.720 --> 09:53.760
What happened, darling?

09:54.760 --> 09:55.760
Aunt Kesar.

09:56.320 --> 09:58.480
-Aunt Kesar!
-Yes, madam.

09:59.200 --> 10:00.760
Aunt Kesar, ask the driver to get the car.

10:01.240 --> 10:03.120
-We have to go to the hospital.
-Sure, madam.

10:07.480 --> 10:08.640
Medical tests were done.

10:09.280 --> 10:11.840
Blood samples were
sent to a bigger hospital.

10:13.200 --> 10:16.160
Before I could ask
the doctors about him...

10:45.920 --> 10:48.200
Darling! Darling!

10:48.280 --> 10:51.080
What's happening to you?
What's happening, darling?

10:54.280 --> 10:55.960
I'll call... I'll call the doctor.

10:59.920 --> 11:02.240
Doctor! Doctor, come quickly.

11:02.320 --> 11:03.680
-What happened?
-My husband, doctor.

11:03.760 --> 11:05.200
Please, doctor. Please come quickly.

11:06.080 --> 11:07.160
Oh, my God!

11:08.920 --> 11:11.120
Sister, he's having a bad muscle spasm.

11:18.000 --> 11:19.360
We must get him out of this state.

11:20.440 --> 11:23.240
-Get me lidocaine 20 mg, quickly.
-Okay.

11:30.040 --> 11:32.120
What is wrong with him, doctor?

11:32.200 --> 11:34.360
If I'm not mistaken, Mrs. Veer,

11:34.440 --> 11:36.760
your husband is suffering from tetanus.

11:37.000 --> 11:39.080
It's a very rare condition.

11:39.160 --> 11:41.760
It affects only one in a thousand people.

11:42.120 --> 11:45.920
The disease was discovered in Germany
by a Japanese doctor,

11:46.000 --> 11:49.280
but the medicine for curing it
has not yet been found.

11:49.520 --> 11:51.160
The doctor was trying to explain,

11:51.880 --> 11:53.760
but I couldn't understand anything,

11:54.560 --> 11:57.480
except that there is no cure
in medical science

11:58.040 --> 12:00.880
for the disease he was talking about.

12:01.600 --> 12:03.680
The only relief was

12:03.760 --> 12:07.560
that after taking the injection,
he could sleep and rest for a while.

12:51.600 --> 12:54.600
Excuse me, ma'am. There's a call for you
from your residence.

12:59.520 --> 13:01.320
-George, take me home.
-Yes, ma'am.

13:06.040 --> 13:07.120
Please hurry up.

13:51.560 --> 13:52.800
This is black magic.

13:54.520 --> 13:57.080
Doctors cannot cure this.

13:57.840 --> 13:59.120
Aunt Kesar, why would
anyone perform black magic

13:59.200 --> 14:00.840
on a noble person like him?

14:01.440 --> 14:02.440
Forget about enmity,

14:03.000 --> 14:05.360
he doesn't even raise his voice at anyone.

14:06.280 --> 14:09.040
You were born
in the land of Ramayana and Mahabharata.

14:10.880 --> 14:12.280
You'll find traitors

14:13.560 --> 14:14.960
at every nook and corner.

14:16.080 --> 14:18.920
The prince's stepmother never loved him,

14:19.760 --> 14:23.560
so His Highness sent him away for studies,

14:23.680 --> 14:26.680
so that the negativity at home
doesn't affect him.

14:27.640 --> 14:30.120
But the second queen knew

14:30.760 --> 14:33.080
that as long as
the prince was safe and sound,

14:33.160 --> 14:36.400
her own son can never be the heir
to the king's throne.

14:37.480 --> 14:39.040
Now that His Highness is old,

14:39.920 --> 14:41.120
she played this dirty trick.

14:41.360 --> 14:45.080
How dare they try to harm our prince?

14:45.160 --> 14:48.160
Come, Surya Pratap,
let's go and talk to them.

14:48.360 --> 14:49.360
Wait.

14:51.760 --> 14:53.720
You can't douse a fire with fire,

14:54.960 --> 14:56.320
you need water for that.

14:56.760 --> 14:59.560
And this is a fire
which is not even visible.

15:01.120 --> 15:02.440
Do you really think

15:03.320 --> 15:05.360
that you'll go and blame them,

15:06.200 --> 15:08.680
and they'll just bow their heads
and accept it?

15:10.000 --> 15:13.080
We can kill our enemy at any time,

15:13.160 --> 15:16.480
but right now, our aim
is not to kill anyone

15:17.640 --> 15:19.680
but is to save our prince's life.

15:19.760 --> 15:23.200
So are we just going to keep mum
and do nothing, Father?

15:23.280 --> 15:24.280
When did I say that?

15:24.920 --> 15:28.040
To give them a fitting answer, we must
give them a taste of their own medicine.

15:29.600 --> 15:31.360
Get ready to go to Baba.

15:32.280 --> 15:35.680
He will surely have an answer
for this black magic.

15:36.160 --> 15:37.520
Praises to Mahakali.

15:39.280 --> 15:43.160
Your Highness, did they bring
everything I had asked for?

15:43.240 --> 15:44.240
Yes, Baba.

15:48.360 --> 15:49.360
Photograph.

15:54.960 --> 15:57.560
Baba, why did you ask for this mirror?

15:57.960 --> 15:59.280
In plain sight,

15:59.800 --> 16:02.680
one can only see
a person's image in the mirror.

16:02.760 --> 16:03.760
But if we look carefully,

16:04.720 --> 16:06.680
then the mirror reflects the entire world.

16:06.920 --> 16:08.160
The only difference is

16:08.680 --> 16:10.720
that there is another world
in this reflection.

16:11.040 --> 16:13.960
A world which runs parallel to this world.

16:15.160 --> 16:17.160
Usually, the beings of that world
are not allowed to come here,

16:17.600 --> 16:20.000
and beings of this world
are not allowed to go there.

16:20.480 --> 16:23.160
But when a spirit breaks the law
and enters this world

16:24.120 --> 16:25.960
and troubles the people here,

16:27.280 --> 16:31.680
then we also have to break some laws
to pin it down.

16:32.200 --> 16:34.120
But what will you do
with this photograph, Baba?

16:35.640 --> 16:39.720
This photograph will drag the evil spirit
that's torturing Veer, to us.

16:41.160 --> 16:43.040
And I'll tie it down
with the power of mantras

16:43.960 --> 16:45.960
and free Veer forever.

18:49.360 --> 18:50.360
Your Highness,

18:51.480 --> 18:55.560
that evil spirit
is far more powerful than our expectation.

18:56.720 --> 18:58.200
I cannot do this, Your Highness.

18:58.520 --> 19:01.760
If you don't help us, we'll have no hope.

19:02.120 --> 19:05.200
Your Highness,
there is only one person in this world

19:05.960 --> 19:08.480
who can save the prince's life.

19:09.200 --> 19:11.240
And that's the Baba of Mewar,

19:11.320 --> 19:13.400
and your family knows him very well.

19:35.760 --> 19:36.760
Uncle.

19:53.360 --> 19:54.360
Greetings, Princess.

19:57.080 --> 19:58.760
Tell me the truth, uncle.

19:59.640 --> 20:01.360
What is everyone trying to hide from me?

20:01.760 --> 20:04.000
Why doesn't anyone want to go
to the Baba of Mewar?

20:08.560 --> 20:12.080
Uncle, you've always treated me
as your own daughter.

20:13.440 --> 20:16.080
For my sake,
please don't hide anything from me.

20:22.600 --> 20:24.000
Then, listen, Princess.

20:26.360 --> 20:28.320
The Baba of Mewar is none other than Jai.

20:29.480 --> 20:30.480
Jai Singh Gujjar.

20:38.960 --> 20:39.960
Jai?

21:04.960 --> 21:06.960
My daughter is getting married
in two months.

21:08.240 --> 21:11.480
We've tried everything
from medicines to prayers.

21:12.360 --> 21:13.480
Nothing helped.

21:14.520 --> 21:18.120
Now, only you can do some magic.

21:20.800 --> 21:22.120
You are older than me.

21:23.200 --> 21:25.160
Please do not embarrass me by requesting.

21:26.560 --> 21:28.040
Everything will be fine.

21:44.560 --> 21:48.080
Whom did you bring
to save your darling daughter?

21:48.320 --> 21:49.320
Him?

21:52.840 --> 21:56.360
You really think he can save
the apple of your eye?

21:57.520 --> 21:59.680
He himself has spent five years in jail.

22:00.280 --> 22:02.280
And do you know for which crime?

22:05.320 --> 22:08.640
Pratap Singh, please go outside.

22:09.880 --> 22:11.280
Okay, but...

22:11.360 --> 22:14.800
Look, you won't be able to bear
what's going to transpire here.

22:30.560 --> 22:31.560
Now tell me, who are you?

22:32.960 --> 22:34.760
Why are you troubling this innocent girl?

22:34.960 --> 22:36.720
If you want to know, then listen.

22:38.360 --> 22:42.160
I was sitting on the Peepal tree
during dusk.

22:43.000 --> 22:46.880
And she was returning from the fair.

22:48.680 --> 22:51.760
As soon as she lost her way
and came on to the dirt road,

22:53.600 --> 22:55.720
I fell in love with her.

22:57.000 --> 23:00.760
And I took her under my power.

23:06.320 --> 23:08.400
Now go back to where you came from.

23:08.960 --> 23:10.560
Otherwise, I'll make you
pay dearly for it.

23:12.880 --> 23:16.080
A convict is going to save this girl

23:16.160 --> 23:18.080
with the knowledge he gained in jail?

23:18.160 --> 23:19.160
From me?

23:24.400 --> 23:26.760
What are you doing? What are you doing?

23:27.240 --> 23:28.880
As long as it's in my hand,

23:29.640 --> 23:31.480
it's the holy water from the Ganges.

23:32.280 --> 23:33.960
But the minute it touches you,

23:34.960 --> 23:36.200
it'll turn into acid.

23:36.720 --> 23:38.920
Shut your trap and get lost!

23:51.680 --> 23:53.120
Leave this girl's body.

23:53.200 --> 23:55.760
I'll not leave her! You heard me?

23:55.880 --> 23:58.760
I'll not leave her! She's mine, only mine!

27:01.720 --> 27:04.920
If she can't be mine,
then I won't let her be anyone's.

28:16.360 --> 28:19.240
I'll be indebted to you for life,

28:19.760 --> 28:21.880
but please accept this small gift from us.

28:22.800 --> 28:25.760
I did not learn this skill from my guru
to earn money.

28:26.680 --> 28:30.680
Your daughter needs these jewels,
Pratap Singh, not me.

28:32.040 --> 28:35.400
All I need is an invite for her wedding.

28:59.320 --> 29:00.720
The royal chariot

29:01.960 --> 29:03.520
at a pauper's doorstep?

29:04.960 --> 29:06.560
There has to be a reason.

29:10.680 --> 29:12.720
Princess Shivangi has come from London.

29:16.880 --> 29:17.960
She wants to meet you.

29:19.120 --> 29:21.360
I don't care what she wants.

29:22.240 --> 29:26.360
But I want you to go back immediately
with her message.

29:27.760 --> 29:29.960
I don't want to meet your princess.

29:30.040 --> 29:31.040
-But...
-Enough, uncle.

29:32.600 --> 29:33.960
I am requesting you

29:34.880 --> 29:36.920
because you are older than me.

29:39.120 --> 29:40.640
If you come here again,

29:41.560 --> 29:44.280
or even utter
your princess' name in front of me,

29:45.560 --> 29:47.400
then I won't be able to respect your age.

29:47.960 --> 29:49.240
What a dilemma!

29:50.760 --> 29:52.440
You don't want to come with me,

29:53.640 --> 29:55.440
and I cannot leave without you.

29:57.200 --> 29:58.520
I will wait outside.

30:14.640 --> 30:18.040
Lies, lies, lies! You've been lying to me
for the last four years.

30:18.960 --> 30:22.080
The truth is that you don't have
the courage to talk to my father.

30:24.880 --> 30:26.280
It's not about courage, Shivangi.

30:28.120 --> 30:32.160
It's about the mindset of royals
about us commoners.

30:34.240 --> 30:35.760
I'm not scared of your father.

30:37.440 --> 30:38.720
I'm scared of myself.

30:39.800 --> 30:43.720
Because I know that I won't
be able to bear his rejection.

30:44.640 --> 30:46.880
And if Father gets me married
to someone else,

30:46.960 --> 30:48.120
will you be able to bear that?

30:49.200 --> 30:51.280
You stay right here,
I'm going to tell Father

30:51.360 --> 30:54.000
that I'm ready to marry
anyone of his choice.

30:54.760 --> 30:55.760
Shivangi!

30:56.720 --> 30:57.720
Shivangi!

30:59.080 --> 31:01.680
Why are you upset?

31:01.760 --> 31:05.960
Don't be so angry with me

31:06.200 --> 31:10.280
I can't even breathe without you

31:10.440 --> 31:14.800
I don't know why

31:15.360 --> 31:19.680
Oh, let me stay

31:19.840 --> 31:23.560
Let me stay lost in your love

31:24.360 --> 31:28.000
Let me float dreaming about you

31:28.080 --> 31:33.560
Let it be please

31:34.240 --> 31:38.160
I am the dawn of your night, right?

31:38.480 --> 31:42.880
My name is your destiny, right?

32:29.600 --> 32:31.480
There is

32:32.120 --> 32:35.800
A mark of your lips

32:36.120 --> 32:38.200
On my lips

32:38.560 --> 32:40.400
On lonely nights

32:41.040 --> 32:46.200
I feel proud to be with you

32:46.400 --> 32:49.960
I've felt it

32:50.240 --> 32:52.480
I know it

32:52.560 --> 32:55.480
That you touched me, right?

32:55.560 --> 32:59.400
I am the dawn of your night, right?

32:59.480 --> 33:04.520
My name is your destiny, right?

33:04.600 --> 33:09.040
I am the dawn of your night, right?

33:09.120 --> 33:14.480
My name is your destiny, right?

33:19.440 --> 33:20.440
What are you looking at?

33:21.600 --> 33:24.240
Your lifeline is shorter than mine.

33:26.560 --> 33:29.840
It's silly to look for your destiny
in some lines on the palm.

33:30.960 --> 33:33.960
Don't laugh. If something happened to you,
what will I do?

33:36.600 --> 33:37.920
If I have to leave you,

33:39.360 --> 33:40.640
then I won't be able to go
even if I wanted to.

33:46.200 --> 33:47.200
Are you mad?

33:47.480 --> 33:50.360
Now our lifelines are equal.

33:51.880 --> 33:54.320
Now we will live together
and die together.

33:59.840 --> 34:02.240
I need it

34:02.480 --> 34:06.160
Like one needs air

34:06.480 --> 34:08.480
To breathe

34:08.880 --> 34:11.160
The same way

34:11.520 --> 34:16.360
Your presence is a must for me

34:16.880 --> 34:20.480
The bond of our love

34:20.560 --> 34:22.680
Will stay for ever

34:22.800 --> 34:25.640
Like it has stayed for eons, right?

34:25.880 --> 34:30.320
I am the dawn of your night, right?

34:30.400 --> 34:34.760
My name is your destiny, right?

34:34.840 --> 34:39.120
I am the dawn of your night, right?

34:39.200 --> 34:44.960
My name is your destiny, right?

35:26.960 --> 35:28.360
-You?
-Why?

35:30.280 --> 35:32.400
Did you come to meet someone else
in these caves?

35:35.160 --> 35:39.040
What does that penniless shepherd have

35:40.800 --> 35:43.680
that we royals don't have?

35:43.760 --> 35:45.160
Rana!

35:45.240 --> 35:47.880
-If you were not my aunt's husband...
-Then?

35:49.920 --> 35:54.520
Then how would I have met
a beautiful girl like you?

35:57.600 --> 35:59.040
You are the only one I like

36:00.440 --> 36:02.080
in that huge palace.

36:02.360 --> 36:05.720
If a vagrant shepherd stole you from me,

36:06.560 --> 36:10.680
then what's the use of
being born in a royal family?

36:11.040 --> 36:14.360
-Rana! Leave me, otherwise...
-Otherwise what? What?

36:15.160 --> 36:16.600
You'll go home and tell everyone that

36:16.680 --> 36:19.120
you were getting cozy
with that rascal shepherd here?

36:19.920 --> 36:21.640
For your own good,

36:22.760 --> 36:25.200
do as I say.

36:25.880 --> 36:27.080
You take care of me,

36:27.800 --> 36:31.320
and I will take care
of your little secret forever.

36:46.040 --> 36:47.040
Jai.

37:04.600 --> 37:06.400
Jai, stop! Jai!

37:15.360 --> 37:16.360
Jai!

37:43.360 --> 37:44.360
Jai!

37:53.960 --> 37:54.960
Jai, stop!

37:55.160 --> 37:56.640
Jai, don't do this!

37:58.560 --> 37:59.960
Jai, leave Rana!

38:00.920 --> 38:01.920
Jai!

38:02.360 --> 38:04.240
Jai, for my sake, leave Rana.

38:17.960 --> 38:19.440
This is royal blood.

38:21.200 --> 38:22.520
You'll pay dearly for it.

38:27.520 --> 38:31.720
Your Honor, the truth is that Jai Singh
and the princess know each other very well

38:32.160 --> 38:33.560
and they are friends.

38:33.640 --> 38:35.760
Whatever Jai Singh did,
he did it in self-defense.

38:35.840 --> 38:36.840
It's a lie, My Lord.

38:37.880 --> 38:40.680
How can this criminal Jai Singh
and the princess be friends?

38:41.040 --> 38:42.280
One is a princess

38:42.760 --> 38:44.600
and the other one is a shepherd.

38:44.680 --> 38:46.160
Their match is impossible.

38:46.280 --> 38:51.160
I think we should not waste
the court's time with such arguments.

38:52.960 --> 38:55.600
So I would like to
call upon my next witness,

38:55.960 --> 38:57.400
Princess Shivangi.

39:12.640 --> 39:17.120
Princess Shivangi,
have you ever met Jai Singh before?

39:21.040 --> 39:23.680
Please answer in "yes" or "no"
for the court.

39:25.000 --> 39:26.000
Yes.

39:27.680 --> 39:29.360
Is he your friend?

39:35.120 --> 39:36.480
Okay, forget it.

39:36.760 --> 39:40.520
Can you tell the court
what happened that day?

39:41.320 --> 39:43.600
Rana Jag Pratap Singh is my uncle.

39:44.840 --> 39:47.440
He would never try to harm me.

39:48.760 --> 39:50.160
I know Jai Singh.

39:50.680 --> 39:52.280
He came to the Palace Court.

39:53.080 --> 39:54.720
But he's not my friend.

39:54.800 --> 39:56.960
What are you talking about, Shivangi?

39:57.040 --> 39:58.680
Tell them honestly what happened with you.

39:58.760 --> 40:01.760
You have no right to interrupt
the court proceedings.

40:03.640 --> 40:06.600
Please speak freely
without any fear or hesitation.

40:08.800 --> 40:11.440
This man not only troubles me,

40:11.520 --> 40:15.960
but he also said
that he will not sit still

40:16.040 --> 40:17.480
till he wins me over.

40:17.560 --> 40:20.080
It's a lie! She's lying!

40:20.160 --> 40:21.640
Shivangi, what happened to you?

40:21.720 --> 40:23.760
-Silence! Silence!
-But, Your Honor, she's...

40:23.840 --> 40:25.160
Do not interrupt court proceedings!

40:26.160 --> 40:28.960
When Rana Jag Pratap Singh
heard about this,

40:29.040 --> 40:33.240
he went to him to save the family's honor
and to make him understand.

40:33.320 --> 40:37.400
But he didn't respect his age
or his position,

40:37.480 --> 40:39.400
and he attacked him.

40:39.480 --> 40:41.560
It's a lie! It's a total lie!

40:42.240 --> 40:43.880
Shivangi, why are you doing this to me?

40:44.400 --> 40:46.880
Shivangi, why don't you tell them
that you love me?

40:47.560 --> 40:48.760
Shivangi, look at me!

40:49.440 --> 40:51.480
For the sake of our love, Shivangi!

40:52.560 --> 40:57.160
Shivangi, look at me
and say that you don't love me! Shivangi!

41:12.520 --> 41:16.440
This court pronounces
accused Jai Singh Gujjar guilty

41:16.520 --> 41:20.360
and sentences him
to five years rigorous imprisonment.

41:23.200 --> 41:24.200
Shivangi.

41:31.560 --> 41:32.760
Why did you do this?

41:34.360 --> 41:36.680
-Why?
-It took me time to realize

41:36.760 --> 41:39.960
that the honor of a royal family
weighs more than every relationship.

41:40.480 --> 41:43.160
Royals must stand by the royals

41:43.400 --> 41:46.480
and not with penniless shepherds.

42:14.960 --> 42:15.960
Uncle!

42:16.560 --> 42:17.960
I told you I will not come!

42:18.920 --> 42:20.200
Go away from here!

42:29.000 --> 42:30.240
Uncle, I...

42:44.880 --> 42:47.360
I know that you don't want to meet me.

42:48.960 --> 42:51.560
But only you can help me, Jai.

42:57.480 --> 43:01.000
And if he's not freed from
the clutches of that evil spirit soon,

43:02.800 --> 43:04.240
he will die, Jai.

43:06.680 --> 43:08.760
So finally the royals

43:09.680 --> 43:13.800
need the help of a penniless shepherd.

43:14.280 --> 43:16.200
I know I've wronged you.

43:17.800 --> 43:20.280
But why are you punishing
an innocent for it, Jai?

43:22.560 --> 43:23.840
I beg you,

43:24.960 --> 43:26.480
save my husband's life.

43:28.000 --> 43:29.480
Please save Veer, Jai.

43:30.080 --> 43:32.360
Your love might have been
a joke, Shivangi,

43:33.920 --> 43:35.560
but my hatred is not a joke!

43:36.240 --> 43:39.720
When you didn't care for my love,
then why should I care for your love?

43:42.160 --> 43:45.720
I've heard that
you did not learn this skill for yourself

43:45.800 --> 43:47.760
but to help others.

43:49.080 --> 43:53.880
Veer is also among those
who need you and your skill now.

43:55.080 --> 43:56.520
How can you punish someone else

43:57.160 --> 43:59.560
for what happened between us?

44:00.560 --> 44:03.920
If, instead of me,
some other girl had come to you

44:04.000 --> 44:07.160
to beg for her husband's life,

44:07.240 --> 44:09.200
then what would you have done, Jai?

44:09.280 --> 44:11.440
Would you have disappointed her also?

44:17.000 --> 44:18.480
If that's the case, then okay.

44:20.280 --> 44:21.600
For others,

44:22.560 --> 44:23.800
I do it for free.

44:25.160 --> 44:26.800
But from you royals,

44:27.960 --> 44:30.760
I'll take a hefty price for this.

44:31.360 --> 44:34.400
There's nothing more valuable for me
than Veer's life.

44:35.000 --> 44:38.440
Please come to London with me
and save his life.

45:11.760 --> 45:12.760
Aunt Kesar.

45:25.240 --> 45:26.240
How is he, Aunt Kesar?

45:27.360 --> 45:28.560
He's doing fine, right?

45:29.720 --> 45:31.200
Please don't go inside, madam.

45:32.240 --> 45:33.240
Don't go.

45:33.960 --> 45:38.040
What I've seen
over the course of one month,

45:39.200 --> 45:41.680
how will you be able to take it
all of a sudden?

45:41.760 --> 45:44.600
Don't go inside. Don't go inside.

45:45.080 --> 45:47.400
You won't be able to see him like this.

45:48.440 --> 45:49.480
You won't be...

47:26.040 --> 47:28.400
You didn't make any mistake
in bringing me here, Shivangi.

47:28.480 --> 47:32.160
This evil spirit has completely taken over
your husband's body.

47:33.240 --> 47:35.080
This witch is stealing

47:35.160 --> 47:38.880
Veer's life and power.

47:39.800 --> 47:41.480
If we don't do something soon,

47:43.240 --> 47:44.680
it'll be difficult to save him.

47:46.640 --> 47:50.240
We only have one week's time.

47:51.160 --> 47:52.800
Then do something, Jai. Do something.

47:52.880 --> 47:55.280
Whichever prayer or treatment
is required, do it.

47:55.360 --> 47:58.960
But please... Please save him, Jai.
Please save him.

48:00.080 --> 48:01.320
I'll save him,

48:01.840 --> 48:05.080
but for that, we'll have to take him home.

48:24.160 --> 48:25.160
This is strange.

48:26.200 --> 48:27.880
It's your husband, your decision.

48:29.120 --> 48:31.200
Whether you want to get him treated here
or somewhere else,

48:31.320 --> 48:33.160
what say does the doctor have in it?

48:33.680 --> 48:34.680
I said the same to him.

48:35.320 --> 48:38.480
But the doctor said that he is ready
to discharge him from the hospital,

48:38.560 --> 48:42.160
but if anything happens to him after that,
then I'll be responsible for it.

48:42.880 --> 48:44.760
And I'll have to give the same
in writing to him.

48:44.880 --> 48:45.960
Okay, so what's the problem with that?

48:46.480 --> 48:49.040
Today there is no problem,
but what if something comes up later?

48:49.640 --> 48:54.160
God forbid, if something happens to him,
then my in-laws will blame me.

49:01.360 --> 49:02.360
There is one way.

49:02.960 --> 49:04.800
There is a difference between
good and evil spirits.

49:05.520 --> 49:07.440
Evil spirits continue thinking
about material pleasures

49:07.520 --> 49:09.400
even after leaving the body.

49:10.040 --> 49:11.280
Especially taste.

49:12.000 --> 49:14.280
So to attract evil spirits,

49:14.360 --> 49:17.520
sometimes we have to use liquor and meat.

49:21.760 --> 49:24.480
Mrs. Veer, we are educated people

49:24.560 --> 49:27.680
living in the age of science
and medical revolution.

49:27.760 --> 49:30.320
I'm shocked that
you still believe in black magic.

49:30.880 --> 49:35.760
What you're suggesting is, quite frankly,
not only nonsensical,

49:35.840 --> 49:37.000
it's ridiculous.

49:37.160 --> 49:40.120
Please, doctor. Please.
You promised me five minutes.

49:40.200 --> 49:43.320
Five minutes is all I'm asking you for.
Please, doctor.

49:45.160 --> 49:46.440
If you insist.

49:51.400 --> 49:53.000
What is in that piece of cloth?

49:54.560 --> 49:57.680
You will find out, doctor.
Please be patient.

50:04.120 --> 50:06.360
Now ask him to accompany us
to the prince's room.

50:07.040 --> 50:10.360
He will believe me
after he sees what happens there.

53:28.280 --> 53:29.280
Shivangi, you...

53:40.560 --> 53:42.120
Wipe your tears, Shivangi.

53:43.920 --> 53:45.520
As long as I'm here,

53:47.160 --> 53:48.760
nothing will happen to your Veer.

53:54.160 --> 53:55.880
Can I see those photographs?

54:07.360 --> 54:09.560
If your in-laws have done this,

54:10.480 --> 54:12.760
then they cannot do this
only with mantras.

54:13.800 --> 54:18.960
They must have used some medium
to bring this evil here.

54:20.600 --> 54:22.840
Think hard. Did you get
any eatables from there?

54:25.320 --> 54:27.560
Or did someone bring any blessed food,
coconut or flowers from them,

54:27.640 --> 54:29.960
something which you still have at home?

54:32.480 --> 54:34.760
No, I don't remember anything like that.

54:35.560 --> 54:36.960
How can this be?

54:37.920 --> 54:39.880
Without any medium,

54:39.960 --> 54:41.960
from a distance of
thousands of kilometers...

54:43.320 --> 54:44.320
No.

54:45.720 --> 54:47.520
There must be something
that you are forgetting.

54:48.680 --> 54:52.080
Well, a few days ago,
someone sent us a gift from India.

54:52.760 --> 54:55.400
Gift? What gift? Who sent it and when?

54:55.480 --> 54:57.880
A few days ago,
we received a locket by post.

55:00.240 --> 55:01.240
A locket?

55:40.480 --> 55:41.800
What will happen now, Jai?

55:42.160 --> 55:45.840
First, we have to reverse
what has already happened.

55:47.240 --> 55:48.440
Is there a river or a canal nearby?

55:49.640 --> 55:50.640
Yes.

55:51.080 --> 55:52.800
The Thames river is about 10 km from here.

55:54.600 --> 55:56.720
Now we'll have to wait till night.

56:06.160 --> 56:10.200
Night meets dusk at 3:00 a.m.

56:12.200 --> 56:13.600
We'll have to immerse this locket

56:14.760 --> 56:16.280
exactly at 3:00 a.m.

56:17.720 --> 56:19.320
You have memorized
the mantras well, right?

56:21.000 --> 56:24.160
-Yes.
-One mistake can cost us three lives.

56:25.240 --> 56:28.960
Your husband's, yours, and mine.

56:30.360 --> 56:33.120
You have to fight this battle
only for 15 minutes.

56:34.440 --> 56:36.560
I will start from here at 9:00 p.m.,

56:36.640 --> 56:39.640
and at exactly 3:00 a.m.,
I'll be at the river and immerse this.

56:39.720 --> 56:42.160
But till then, you must
continue chanting the mantras

56:42.240 --> 56:43.640
to pin the evil spirit here.

56:43.720 --> 56:46.960
If that doesn't happen,
the evil spirit will come after me

56:47.040 --> 56:48.640
to try and stop me,

56:48.720 --> 56:50.280
and it might succeed, too.

56:50.360 --> 56:52.160
I won't let it happen, Jai.

56:52.240 --> 56:55.400
Come what may,
I will not let it escape from here.

56:55.960 --> 56:58.560
Shivangi, I know
that you'll try your best,

56:59.720 --> 57:03.960
but I also know that the evil spirit
will put in double the efforts

57:04.040 --> 57:05.080
to escape from here.

57:05.160 --> 57:08.440
It will try to scare you,
tempt you, and fool you.

57:08.520 --> 57:10.320
But under any circumstances, Shivangi,

57:10.400 --> 57:13.160
do not stop chanting the mantras
before 3:00 p.m.

57:13.240 --> 57:14.240
Not even for a second.

57:41.680 --> 57:45.160
She's ready, and so are we.

58:19.840 --> 58:23.640
Madam, don't stop chanting.
Don't stop chanting.

58:43.200 --> 58:45.160
Don't worry, madam.

58:45.400 --> 58:46.760
I'll get the lantern.

59:24.520 --> 59:25.960
George! River!

59:27.320 --> 59:28.360
River!

59:51.760 --> 59:53.360
Don't stop chanting.

59:55.680 --> 59:57.360
Don't stop chanting.

59:58.280 --> 1:00:01.160
Madam, don't stop chanting.

1:00:02.080 --> 1:00:03.360
Don't stop chanting.

1:01:29.160 --> 1:01:31.640
Shivangi, why are you hiding there?

1:01:32.440 --> 1:01:33.480
What happened?

1:01:37.360 --> 1:01:39.560
Shivangi, what's the problem? Tell me.

1:01:40.880 --> 1:01:41.920
What is all this?

1:01:48.160 --> 1:01:49.160
What happened, Shivangi?

1:01:52.360 --> 1:01:54.360
What happened? Why are you crying?

1:01:54.720 --> 1:01:56.360
Are you okay?

1:01:58.560 --> 1:02:00.240
God has answered my prayers.

1:02:01.000 --> 1:02:04.160
He returned you to me, safe and sound.

1:03:08.920 --> 1:03:10.160
Send this to London.

1:03:11.160 --> 1:03:12.160
Will she come?

1:03:13.200 --> 1:03:14.360
I am her ailment

1:03:15.080 --> 1:03:16.240
and the treatment.

1:03:17.200 --> 1:03:18.720
Shivangi will have to come.

1:03:23.320 --> 1:03:25.400
I beg you, come to London with me.

1:03:26.120 --> 1:03:27.200
Save my husband's life.

1:03:29.040 --> 1:03:30.720
Please save Veer, Jai.

1:04:05.440 --> 1:04:07.360
Princess Shivangi,

1:04:08.880 --> 1:04:13.360
just like only snake venom
can cure a snake bite,

1:04:14.520 --> 1:04:18.400
Veer's ailment and treatment,

1:04:19.240 --> 1:04:20.480
both are in this locket.

1:04:22.560 --> 1:04:25.480
Now no one can save Veer.

1:04:26.680 --> 1:04:28.280
No one!

1:04:58.080 --> 1:05:00.520
I made this mistake
even though I knew everything.

1:05:01.160 --> 1:05:03.720
I fell for her trick
even after you warned me

1:05:03.800 --> 1:05:05.000
and stopped chanting the mantras.

1:05:05.640 --> 1:05:07.720
If I hadn't done that,
she wouldn't have escaped

1:05:08.440 --> 1:05:10.720
and attacked and injured you.

1:05:10.960 --> 1:05:12.680
I'm not worried about my wounds, Shivangi.

1:05:14.040 --> 1:05:16.120
I'm only thinking about your husband.

1:05:17.760 --> 1:05:19.720
I'm not upset that we did not succeed.

1:05:20.360 --> 1:05:23.280
I'm upset that success slipped away
from just an arm's reach.

1:05:24.320 --> 1:05:25.360
A small...

1:05:26.000 --> 1:05:28.680
We made a small mistake
and we lost everything.

1:05:29.840 --> 1:05:31.160
If that hadn't happened,

1:05:31.840 --> 1:05:34.000
we could have saved your husband forever.

1:05:35.960 --> 1:05:37.600
I have full faith in you, Jai,

1:05:38.120 --> 1:05:40.120
that you will find another solution

1:05:40.640 --> 1:05:42.360
and that you can still save Veer.

1:05:44.120 --> 1:05:47.120
Now I can think of
only one solution, Shivangi.

1:05:48.680 --> 1:05:50.720
Now it's not enough
to chop the tree in half.

1:05:51.520 --> 1:05:53.520
We'll have to uproot it completely.

1:05:54.520 --> 1:05:58.600
And for that, we need to find out
where this evil spirit came from.

1:06:07.600 --> 1:06:08.760
There are evil spirits

1:06:09.720 --> 1:06:10.720
and good ones, too.

1:06:11.560 --> 1:06:15.160
If we want to know the name of the witch,
or where she came from,

1:06:15.880 --> 1:06:18.480
then we have to reach out
to a good spirit.

1:06:18.920 --> 1:06:20.480
This lemon will only stop at the place

1:06:21.040 --> 1:06:24.480
where it can find a spirit
that would help us.

1:06:25.880 --> 1:06:27.920
I will throw this lemon out of the door,

1:06:28.720 --> 1:06:29.920
and you will have to go and find it.

1:06:30.760 --> 1:06:32.680
It sounds easy, but it's not.

1:06:33.560 --> 1:06:38.040
Because that witch will keep trying
to attack you and hide its true self.

1:06:39.240 --> 1:06:42.920
And if you came back empty-handed,
then we will never be able to find her.

1:06:43.400 --> 1:06:44.440
Are you ready?

1:06:58.800 --> 1:06:59.840
Shivangi,

1:07:03.120 --> 1:07:04.360
take care of yourself.

1:07:05.080 --> 1:07:07.080
And if you feel scared,

1:07:07.800 --> 1:07:11.000
remember that your friend
is always with you.

1:08:52.320 --> 1:08:54.080
-Madam!
-Stop, Aunt Kesar.

1:08:56.640 --> 1:08:58.400
Neither can you fight this battle, nor I.

1:08:59.720 --> 1:09:02.120
Only a loving wife can fight this battle.

1:12:15.160 --> 1:12:17.240
-Sajjangarh?
-Yes.

1:12:19.320 --> 1:12:21.120
You got the same answer

1:12:22.000 --> 1:12:23.440
that you already knew.

1:12:23.520 --> 1:12:24.800
What do you mean?

1:12:24.880 --> 1:12:27.280
It means that this evil spirit

1:12:28.000 --> 1:12:30.520
has its roots
in Shivangi's husband's home.

1:12:31.800 --> 1:12:33.560
What should I do now, Aunt Kesar?

1:12:34.360 --> 1:12:35.800
Should I still keep quiet?

1:12:36.440 --> 1:12:38.760
Should I still think about
the family honor

1:12:38.840 --> 1:12:40.800
and lower my eyes

1:12:40.880 --> 1:12:42.800
and wait for Veer to die?

1:12:43.200 --> 1:12:44.240
Then what will you do?

1:12:44.320 --> 1:12:46.840
I will ask them the price
of my husband's life.

1:12:47.520 --> 1:12:51.720
And even if I have to pay the price
with my life, I am ready for that, too.

1:12:52.440 --> 1:12:56.240
Can one's family do something like this
just to gain power?

1:12:57.440 --> 1:12:58.960
I cannot believe it.

1:13:00.280 --> 1:13:01.560
I will not leave them, Jai!

1:13:02.720 --> 1:13:04.720
Stop acting childish, Shivangi.

1:13:05.280 --> 1:13:08.600
Do you think that you will blame them
for your husband's illness,

1:13:08.680 --> 1:13:09.800
and they will just accept it?

1:13:09.880 --> 1:13:11.120
They will have to accept it.

1:13:11.200 --> 1:13:12.840
Don't be crazy, Shivangi.

1:13:12.920 --> 1:13:15.480
Your in-laws will smartly deny
any knowledge

1:13:15.560 --> 1:13:17.840
about the gift or the Subedar's letter.

1:13:17.920 --> 1:13:20.600
Shivangi, this is not the right time
to argue with them.

1:13:20.720 --> 1:13:22.520
It's the time to save your husband's life.

1:13:22.960 --> 1:13:27.800
This lemon told us that the evil spirit
has its roots in Sajjangarh.

1:13:28.200 --> 1:13:31.000
But it doesn't mean that you can go there
and cut those roots.

1:13:34.560 --> 1:13:36.320
Then what should I do, Jai?

1:13:36.400 --> 1:13:38.200
Should I keep mum and watch the show

1:13:38.280 --> 1:13:40.200
-even after knowing everything?
-No.

1:13:41.280 --> 1:13:43.600
You just take care of your husband.

1:13:44.320 --> 1:13:48.320
And I will go there and cut those roots.

1:13:49.240 --> 1:13:52.640
I will not let
that witch succeed, Shivangi.

1:13:52.720 --> 1:13:53.760
This is my promise to you.

1:14:04.240 --> 1:14:07.520
I will never forget
what you are doing for me.

1:14:09.480 --> 1:14:12.280
-What is this?
-I'm fulfilling my promise.

1:14:12.560 --> 1:14:14.320
But I haven't completed my job yet.

1:14:15.200 --> 1:14:17.680
I'll take the payment when my job is done.

1:14:19.440 --> 1:14:20.480
Jai.

1:14:22.080 --> 1:14:23.440
Thank you so much.

1:14:25.240 --> 1:14:27.040
I'm not doing this for you,

1:14:27.920 --> 1:14:29.880
I'm doing this for myself.

1:14:30.880 --> 1:14:32.600
I mean, I get great joy

1:14:33.320 --> 1:14:37.520
by doing this for you. Bye.

1:16:40.000 --> 1:16:41.280
Waterloo Station, please.

1:16:53.320 --> 1:16:54.800
Please, hurry up, George.

1:17:42.080 --> 1:17:43.280
Jai!

1:17:46.760 --> 1:17:49.280
I never told you the name of the person
who sent the locket.

1:17:49.960 --> 1:17:51.720
Then how do you know

1:17:51.800 --> 1:17:53.720
that the Subedar from Sajjangarh
sent the locket?

1:17:55.880 --> 1:17:58.600
Your in-laws will smartly deny
any knowledge

1:17:58.680 --> 1:18:00.880
about the gift or the Subedar's letter.

1:18:17.280 --> 1:18:21.720
I believed that my in-laws
are taking out their anger on me.

1:18:22.920 --> 1:18:24.080
But I didn't know

1:18:25.320 --> 1:18:28.200
that the person I trusted the most

1:18:29.120 --> 1:18:30.960
is my biggest enemy.

1:18:32.400 --> 1:18:34.320
You sent the evil spirit to me,

1:18:35.120 --> 1:18:39.040
and I kept begging for your help
to get rid of it.

1:18:42.760 --> 1:18:45.040
I held your hand for protection,

1:18:46.000 --> 1:18:49.760
but you pushed me deeper into trouble.

1:18:50.280 --> 1:18:54.120
Yes! Because you held my hand
for selfish reasons

1:18:55.080 --> 1:18:57.120
and left it, too, for selfish reasons.

1:18:58.280 --> 1:19:00.080
I didn't cheat you, you cheated me

1:19:01.040 --> 1:19:02.520
by accusing me in court,

1:19:03.600 --> 1:19:05.800
by turning my love into a laughing stock,

1:19:07.200 --> 1:19:08.600
by showing me my worth.

1:19:09.720 --> 1:19:11.800
I was convicted
for only five years, Shivangi,

1:19:12.680 --> 1:19:14.080
but I'm still paying for it.

1:19:15.480 --> 1:19:17.280
That day the judge
listened to your testimony,

1:19:17.360 --> 1:19:19.000
gave the verdict,

1:19:19.080 --> 1:19:21.400
and robbed me of all my happiness.

1:19:22.400 --> 1:19:23.480
And I...

1:19:24.280 --> 1:19:26.040
I heard the testimony of my heart

1:19:27.120 --> 1:19:29.600
and decided to rob you
of all your happiness.

1:19:30.600 --> 1:19:33.720
I had given the verdict
of your husband's death in Sajjangarh.

1:19:34.760 --> 1:19:37.520
I came here just to seal the deal.

1:19:38.480 --> 1:19:40.760
And that I did
by immersing the locket in the river.

1:19:44.880 --> 1:19:48.280
I can't tell you, Shivangi,

1:19:48.360 --> 1:19:51.600
how much joy your tears bring to me.

1:19:52.800 --> 1:19:55.480
I wanted to see the same pain in your eyes

1:19:56.480 --> 1:19:58.280
which my eyes felt once.

1:20:00.560 --> 1:20:02.160
The pain of losing someone you love.

1:20:03.160 --> 1:20:06.360
Do you think that only you
had to bear that pain?

1:20:07.880 --> 1:20:09.360
Only you were in love?

1:20:10.400 --> 1:20:12.280
Only you got punished?

1:20:14.520 --> 1:20:16.200
Do you want to know

1:20:16.280 --> 1:20:18.760
why I gave false testimony
in the court that day?

1:20:23.080 --> 1:20:24.080
Stop!

1:20:24.600 --> 1:20:26.040
What are you doing, brother?

1:20:26.120 --> 1:20:28.160
Such a small punishment
for such a big criminal?

1:20:28.240 --> 1:20:31.760
He tried to hurt our family's honor.
We should torture him to death.

1:20:31.840 --> 1:20:35.680
We should cut the scoundrel into pieces
and throw them all around.

1:20:35.760 --> 1:20:38.880
I would have done the same with you,

1:20:40.320 --> 1:20:41.680
but what to do,

1:20:42.680 --> 1:20:45.840
the one who tried to harm my honor

1:20:46.480 --> 1:20:49.120
is none other than my sister's husband!

1:20:50.120 --> 1:20:51.800
If I killed you,

1:20:53.680 --> 1:20:56.720
my sister will become a widow.

1:21:00.160 --> 1:21:03.320
Rudra, go and kill him!

1:21:03.400 --> 1:21:06.600
No, brother, no! Don't do this.
Don't do this.

1:21:06.680 --> 1:21:09.600
If he has sinned, then so I have.

1:21:09.680 --> 1:21:12.560
Punish me, brother.
Please do not harm Jai.

1:21:12.640 --> 1:21:14.080
Please don't do this.

1:21:14.160 --> 1:21:15.200
Get out of my way!

1:21:17.200 --> 1:21:20.200
Father, please stop him.
Father, please stop him.

1:21:20.280 --> 1:21:21.880
Please don't kill my Jai.

1:21:23.680 --> 1:21:26.480
I'll tell him to go away from here.

1:21:33.600 --> 1:21:37.360
Father... Father, I've never asked you
for anything.

1:21:37.440 --> 1:21:39.960
But please grant my wish
for the first and last time.

1:21:40.040 --> 1:21:42.440
After this, I'll do whatever you say.

1:21:42.520 --> 1:21:45.560
Please let my Jai go.
Please spare Jai, Father!

1:21:45.640 --> 1:21:49.160
Please spare my Jai. Please grant my wish.

1:21:49.240 --> 1:21:52.160
Please, Father, grant my wish.

1:21:54.840 --> 1:21:55.880
Okay.

1:21:57.080 --> 1:21:59.880
If you don't want me to kill him

1:22:00.880 --> 1:22:03.360
and want our family honor to stay intact,

1:22:04.840 --> 1:22:06.200
then you must do

1:22:08.080 --> 1:22:09.680
what I say.

1:22:13.920 --> 1:22:14.960
Why

1:22:16.040 --> 1:22:17.080
didn't you

1:22:18.240 --> 1:22:19.280
tell me?

1:22:19.880 --> 1:22:21.480
You think from your heart,

1:22:22.280 --> 1:22:26.760
and my family thinks with their guns.

1:22:29.720 --> 1:22:32.760
So someone had to think calmly.

1:22:34.560 --> 1:22:35.600
My lie

1:22:36.720 --> 1:22:39.680
would have kept you in jail
only for a few years.

1:22:41.480 --> 1:22:42.960
But the truth...

1:22:46.360 --> 1:22:48.520
But the truth would have killed you.

1:22:50.120 --> 1:22:51.160
That's why

1:22:52.320 --> 1:22:53.640
I did

1:22:55.240 --> 1:22:56.880
what I felt was right.

1:22:58.240 --> 1:22:59.760
What did I do?

1:23:01.880 --> 1:23:04.360
You sacrificed so much to save my life,

1:23:06.080 --> 1:23:07.080
and I...

1:23:08.680 --> 1:23:10.360
I tried to kill your husband...

1:23:13.440 --> 1:23:14.880
No, Shivangi, no.

1:23:15.880 --> 1:23:18.480
Now, whether I have to
fight a witch or God,

1:23:19.120 --> 1:23:22.480
I promise you, Shivangi,
that nothing will happen to your husband.

1:23:22.760 --> 1:23:23.800
Nothing!

1:24:40.480 --> 1:24:41.520
Hold this.

1:24:54.400 --> 1:24:55.440
Give it.

1:26:00.240 --> 1:26:02.080
Jai! Jai!

1:27:00.720 --> 1:27:01.760
Jai!

1:27:23.600 --> 1:27:24.640
Jai.

1:27:55.120 --> 1:27:56.320
While doing the wrong,

1:27:56.400 --> 1:27:57.640
I did not realize

1:27:58.880 --> 1:28:01.040
that when the time comes to do the right,

1:28:02.280 --> 1:28:04.040
everything will turn wrong.

1:28:05.520 --> 1:28:07.480
Everything will slip out of my hands.

1:28:09.160 --> 1:28:12.240
I myself lost control over the evil spirit

1:28:14.000 --> 1:28:15.920
I sent to subjugate your husband.

1:28:17.120 --> 1:28:21.320
For the first time I'm feeling
so helpless, so powerless.

1:28:21.640 --> 1:28:23.280
What will happen now, Jai?

1:28:23.360 --> 1:28:26.120
We have lesser time than we thought.

1:28:44.440 --> 1:28:46.080
You were right, Shivangi.

1:28:47.640 --> 1:28:49.840
We really are left with very little time.

1:28:51.480 --> 1:28:53.040
What will happen now, Jai?

1:28:54.120 --> 1:28:55.880
How will we save Veer?

1:28:57.280 --> 1:29:00.560
In such little time, how will we free him
from the clutches of that evil spirit?

1:29:04.120 --> 1:29:05.680
Sometimes we have to go back

1:29:07.240 --> 1:29:09.600
and fix our mistake
to be able to move forward.

1:29:11.920 --> 1:29:16.840
I'll also have to reverse the clock
and go back to my guru.

1:29:17.760 --> 1:29:19.520
Only he can find a solution now.

1:29:42.040 --> 1:29:43.080
Do you remember this place?

1:29:45.040 --> 1:29:48.120
It's the same place
where I put my trust in you,

1:29:49.640 --> 1:29:53.840
where I entrusted you with my knowledge
before I passed away.

1:29:54.920 --> 1:29:56.440
For doing good.

1:29:57.360 --> 1:29:59.840
To help the needy.

1:30:01.240 --> 1:30:02.920
Because I knew, Jai,

1:30:04.240 --> 1:30:08.040
that you are being punished for a crime

1:30:08.640 --> 1:30:10.880
which you never committed.

1:30:13.000 --> 1:30:15.640
I was so lost in your innocent eyes,

1:30:17.000 --> 1:30:19.040
that I forgot to look into your heart,

1:30:20.040 --> 1:30:24.280
where the fire of hatred and revenge
was blazing.

1:30:25.000 --> 1:30:26.760
I am sorry, guruji.

1:30:28.400 --> 1:30:30.520
The hatred that I was carrying in my heart

1:30:32.280 --> 1:30:33.840
was unjustified.

1:30:35.640 --> 1:30:36.880
I was wrong, guruji.

1:30:38.840 --> 1:30:39.880
I was wrong.

1:30:41.840 --> 1:30:43.040
Help me, guruji.

1:30:45.000 --> 1:30:46.440
I want to right my wrong.

1:30:47.440 --> 1:30:49.000
What you want to do, Jai,

1:30:50.000 --> 1:30:51.040
is not easy.

1:30:52.600 --> 1:30:54.200
Because what you've already done

1:30:55.080 --> 1:30:56.440
is really dreadful.

1:30:57.840 --> 1:30:59.400
You awakened a witch,

1:31:01.120 --> 1:31:03.040
promised to feed her a soul,

1:31:04.640 --> 1:31:05.680
and now,

1:31:07.240 --> 1:31:09.240
she won't sleep till she gets that soul.

1:31:10.680 --> 1:31:11.720
At the moment,

1:31:12.840 --> 1:31:15.120
she's hunting for Veer's soul.

1:31:15.480 --> 1:31:16.520
Guruji,

1:31:17.440 --> 1:31:19.440
only you can help me.

1:31:21.360 --> 1:31:22.640
I have to save Veer.

1:31:24.200 --> 1:31:26.000
I have to save Shivangi's happiness.

1:31:27.520 --> 1:31:28.760
There is one way.

1:31:48.640 --> 1:31:49.640
Shivangi,

1:31:53.240 --> 1:31:54.640
guruji gave me the solution.

1:31:57.800 --> 1:31:58.840
Yes, madam?

1:32:00.560 --> 1:32:04.000
Ask him if there is any place here
which used to be a place of worship,

1:32:04.560 --> 1:32:06.240
but now no one prays there.

1:32:08.040 --> 1:32:11.800
What kind of a question is this?
How will he answer such a question?

1:32:12.760 --> 1:32:14.520
Didn't he tell you the name of the place?

1:32:15.080 --> 1:32:17.720
A new moon night, under the mountains,

1:32:18.640 --> 1:32:20.440
God's broken abode,

1:32:21.000 --> 1:32:22.480
that's where we'll find our road.

1:32:23.240 --> 1:32:24.960
What are you talking about?

1:32:25.040 --> 1:32:26.400
I'm telling you what my guruji told me.

1:32:29.600 --> 1:32:33.200
George, is there a place here
where people go on a no moonlight night?

1:32:33.280 --> 1:32:34.560
Like a hill or a mountain?

1:32:34.800 --> 1:32:36.040
Not that I know of.

1:32:36.840 --> 1:32:39.240
Wait a minute.
There is a place called No Moon Hill.

1:32:40.760 --> 1:32:42.800
But there's nothing there
except a broken-down church.

1:32:43.440 --> 1:32:44.480
I understood.

1:32:46.000 --> 1:32:47.040
We have to go there.

1:32:52.480 --> 1:32:54.560
But what do we have to do there, Jai?

1:32:54.640 --> 1:32:57.960
-We'll know that after reaching there.
-I didn't understand.

1:32:58.960 --> 1:33:00.440
All I know is that

1:33:01.240 --> 1:33:03.640
we'll surely get help from someone
after reaching there.

1:33:34.320 --> 1:33:37.360
Let me cry my heart out today

1:33:37.440 --> 1:33:40.520
You cheated my soul

1:33:40.600 --> 1:33:43.720
You left me to die

1:33:43.800 --> 1:33:45.920
My darling

1:33:47.040 --> 1:33:50.360
Comfort my wounded heart

1:33:50.440 --> 1:33:52.280
Heal my aching heart

1:33:52.360 --> 1:33:53.400
Sorry.

1:33:53.480 --> 1:33:56.640
Let me see your love again

1:33:56.720 --> 1:33:58.760
My darling

1:34:00.240 --> 1:34:03.080
Are you my habit?

1:34:03.160 --> 1:34:06.360
Or are you my addiction?

1:34:06.440 --> 1:34:11.720
How do I tell you, my love?

1:34:12.600 --> 1:34:15.880
Let me cry my heart out today

1:34:15.960 --> 1:34:18.960
You cheated my soul

1:34:19.040 --> 1:34:22.120
You left me to die

1:34:22.200 --> 1:34:24.840
My darling

1:34:51.880 --> 1:34:56.440
I need you to breathe

1:34:57.000 --> 1:35:02.600
How can one tell you

1:35:04.320 --> 1:35:08.120
Your eyes have such a sparkle

1:35:10.440 --> 1:35:11.760
Jai.

1:35:11.840 --> 1:35:16.440
That my world just lights up

1:35:16.600 --> 1:35:20.720
My heart is aching for love

1:35:23.040 --> 1:35:27.800
All it desires is some relief

1:35:29.520 --> 1:35:32.440
Aching for you is my destiny

1:35:32.520 --> 1:35:35.720
Why can't I have you with me?

1:35:35.800 --> 1:35:37.360
George, please stop the car.

1:35:37.440 --> 1:35:38.840
You are the way and destination, too

1:35:38.920 --> 1:35:41.040
My darling

1:35:42.160 --> 1:35:45.200
Let me cry my heart out today

1:35:45.280 --> 1:35:48.480
You cheated my soul

1:35:48.560 --> 1:35:51.720
You left me to die

1:35:51.800 --> 1:35:53.360
My darling

1:35:55.040 --> 1:35:57.760
Comfort my wounded heart

1:35:57.840 --> 1:36:01.520
Heal my aching heart

1:36:01.600 --> 1:36:04.360
Let me see your love again

1:36:04.440 --> 1:36:07.520
My darling

1:36:19.080 --> 1:36:21.920
My darling

1:36:26.840 --> 1:36:30.800
My darling

1:37:04.160 --> 1:37:05.800
You have come.

1:37:07.280 --> 1:37:08.920
I was waiting for you.

1:37:11.640 --> 1:37:13.200
Don't be surprised.

1:37:14.520 --> 1:37:16.520
It was me you were meant to meet.

1:37:17.040 --> 1:37:19.640
She already knew that we will come here.

1:37:21.640 --> 1:37:23.840
Maybe she's the one who will help us.

1:37:24.480 --> 1:37:25.800
Ask her

1:37:27.080 --> 1:37:28.520
how can she help us.

1:37:31.680 --> 1:37:33.920
I'm going to help you

1:37:34.240 --> 1:37:37.280
by giving you these knives.

1:37:38.160 --> 1:37:39.920
She can understand our language.

1:37:40.200 --> 1:37:44.200
I don't understand
the language of the body,

1:37:44.840 --> 1:37:48.600
but I understand the language of the soul.

1:37:49.000 --> 1:37:50.640
She doesn't understand
the language of the body,

1:37:51.720 --> 1:37:53.160
but she can understand
the language of the soul.

1:38:08.520 --> 1:38:09.760
Ask her

1:38:11.040 --> 1:38:13.200
what do we need to do with these knives.

1:38:19.120 --> 1:38:20.480
Veer! Veer!

1:38:21.200 --> 1:38:23.760
Veer, what happened to you?
Aunt Kesar! Veer!

1:38:23.840 --> 1:38:25.560
In the last 24 hours,

1:38:25.640 --> 1:38:27.760
I felt his breathing stop

1:38:28.920 --> 1:38:30.200
at least twice.

1:38:31.200 --> 1:38:32.800
We have very little time, Aunt Kesar.

1:38:33.560 --> 1:38:36.640
This knife will tell us how little.

1:38:36.720 --> 1:38:38.000
But how?

1:38:38.080 --> 1:38:40.240
What are you going to do?
How are you going to do it?

1:38:40.320 --> 1:38:41.360
I cannot understand anything, Jai.

1:38:42.040 --> 1:38:43.880
-Did you bring the things I asked for?
-Yes.

1:39:14.440 --> 1:39:16.000
This was what the first knife was for.

1:39:17.120 --> 1:39:19.600
Now we only have time
till this sand runs out.

1:39:32.160 --> 1:39:34.000
The second knife has also done its job.

1:39:34.680 --> 1:39:37.560
It has opened the door
to the other world for me.

1:39:37.640 --> 1:39:39.280
As long as the knife is stuck here,

1:39:39.360 --> 1:39:42.200
this would be the only way
between the two worlds.

1:39:43.080 --> 1:39:46.120
Without this door, neither can I come out,
nor can they.

1:39:46.720 --> 1:39:48.920
Now I'll have to go to that world
with the third knife,

1:39:49.560 --> 1:39:52.000
and I'll have to stick the knife in her.

1:39:52.840 --> 1:39:54.240
But why in that world?

1:39:54.320 --> 1:39:56.520
Because in this world,
she's just a spirit.

1:39:56.600 --> 1:39:58.360
But in that world, she has a body, too.

1:39:58.440 --> 1:40:01.040
And a knife can only attack a body,
not the spirit.

1:40:01.120 --> 1:40:02.720
So I must go there.

1:40:03.200 --> 1:40:06.120
You mean, if you go there and do this,

1:40:07.240 --> 1:40:08.320
then everything will become normal?

1:40:08.400 --> 1:40:11.600
No. I'll have to finish her off
in this world.

1:40:12.280 --> 1:40:13.840
But when I attack her with the knife,

1:40:13.920 --> 1:40:16.760
she'll be compelled to give us that locket
which I had immersed in the river.

1:40:17.320 --> 1:40:20.040
As soon as I bring that locket here,
we'll have to burn it.

1:40:20.800 --> 1:40:23.520
As soon as the locket is burned,
the spirit will also turn into ashes.

1:40:23.600 --> 1:40:26.680
And as soon as it's done,
the prince will be back to normal.

1:40:28.240 --> 1:40:31.480
But what if the evil spirit
comes out and attacks us

1:40:31.560 --> 1:40:32.800
after you go inside?

1:40:33.400 --> 1:40:34.720
For that, you'll have to do something.

1:40:35.360 --> 1:40:37.840
Till I come back,
you must hold this coconut tight

1:40:37.920 --> 1:40:41.080
with both hands, in front of this mirror.

1:40:41.160 --> 1:40:43.400
And remember, whatever she does,

1:40:43.480 --> 1:40:46.600
she cannot come outside
till you keep this coconut still.

1:40:46.680 --> 1:40:48.920
So you must not become weak.

1:40:53.400 --> 1:40:54.840
Keep the fire ready, Aunt Kesar.

1:40:55.400 --> 1:40:56.960
Come what may,
I will bring the locket back.

1:43:18.720 --> 1:43:23.480
-Veer!
-Prince! Prince! Prince.

1:47:43.000 --> 1:47:44.120
Jai!

1:47:59.840 --> 1:48:02.000
Veer. Veer?

1:48:06.000 --> 1:48:09.040
Veer! Veer! Veer!

1:48:09.120 --> 1:48:10.200
Veer!

1:48:12.720 --> 1:48:14.520
Veer, you are okay now.

1:48:22.480 --> 1:48:24.920
You are okay now, Veer.

1:49:32.360 --> 1:49:33.480
Veer.

1:49:42.880 --> 1:49:45.400
Shivangi, what happened to you?

1:50:07.360 --> 1:50:09.000
There's only one way.

1:50:10.160 --> 1:50:11.920
That witch desires a soul,

1:50:12.840 --> 1:50:15.680
and she'll not leave
without getting a soul.

1:50:17.000 --> 1:50:18.800
Are you ready to give your life

1:50:19.720 --> 1:50:21.400
and your soul?

1:50:22.280 --> 1:50:25.000
If this is the only way
to return Shivangi's happiness,

1:50:27.600 --> 1:50:28.720
then yes.

1:50:30.400 --> 1:50:33.000
I am ready to give my soul to that witch.
