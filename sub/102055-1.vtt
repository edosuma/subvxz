16:48.355 --> 16:50.313
Aw, Isn't that cute?
It's a heart!

16:50.487 --> 16:52.924
DONIPHAN & JACKSON: Cute!?

16:53.099 --> 16:55.362
JACKSON: We call the sheriff!
This could be a murder
victim or a missing person

16:55.536 --> 16:57.668
or someone off the side of
one of those old milk cartons!

16:57.842 --> 17:00.280
DONIPHAN: Great...

17:00.454 --> 17:03.196
HOPE: This girl's been here
for a long time and she
sure ain't going anywhere.

17:03.370 --> 17:06.590
No rush. Maybe she's got a cool
ring or something?

17:09.115 --> 17:11.987
DONIPHAN: Okay, leave it
alone. I say we don't call
the cops or do anything at all

17:12.161 --> 17:15.599
until we talk to my mom.
Because somebody was basically
buried in Jackie's backyard!

17:15.773 --> 17:18.037
JACKSON: Hope you can't
just rob a dead person!

17:18.211 --> 17:20.735
HOPE: What's she gonna do?
Get angry?

17:20.909 --> 17:22.345
JACKSON: Well how do you
know it's a girl?

17:22.519 --> 17:24.782
HOPE: She's got a cool
necklace... duh

17:28.395 --> 17:30.788

will make a difference

gonna catch anything...
there isn't even a hook.

17:45.803 --> 17:47.066
JACKSON: I know...

17:48.719 --> 17:51.505
DONIPHAN: Okay, so what's the
deal with you right now!?

17:53.115 --> 17:54.377
JACKSON: My family is moving,
we leave monday.

17:56.945 --> 17:59.295
DONIPHAN: What? Why?

18:01.515 --> 18:03.256
HOPE: Where?

18:03.430 --> 18:06.607
JACKSON: My dad got laid off.
He got a job offer in Illinois.

18:06.781 --> 18:08.783
Montgomery told my
dad this morning.

18:08.957 --> 18:11.046
DONIPHAN: And your just now
telling me this?

18:11.220 --> 18:12.830
JACKSON: I guess I didn't think
it would sound so bad

18:13.004 --> 18:15.529
after finding a dead guy
in a hole under our fort.

18:15.703 --> 18:17.618
DONIPHAN: You were wrong.

18:19.750 --> 18:21.100
JACKSON: I was wrong.

18:23.798 --> 18:26.061
HOPE: There's gotta be
something that can be done.

18:26.235 --> 18:30.283
JACKSON: My Dad lost
his job. I can't do
anything, I'm just a kid!

18:32.285 --> 18:34.417
DONIPHAN: Monday?...

18:36.898 --> 18:40.684

DONIPHAN: Mom! Mom! We
were at our base, and we
found some skeleton...

18:45.907 --> 18:48.605
cracked and gross...
and we gotta call someone..

18:48.779 --> 18:51.391
Mom mom, we were at our
base, digging and we found...

18:51.565 --> 18:53.393
and we busted through
some sinkhole and we
found this skeleton

18:53.567 --> 18:56.309
with a crusty old key,
and a chain.

18:56.483 --> 18:58.572

has to leave town, he cant move-

18:58.746 --> 18:59.834
LISA JAMES: Stop!

19:00.008 --> 19:01.314
Just stop!

19:02.271 --> 19:04.273
you lied to me

19:04.447 --> 19:08.059
Doniphan Lee James!
I spoke to your teacher.

19:08.234 --> 19:13.108
You failed your report? Of all
people and of all things? you?

19:13.282 --> 19:15.328
DONIPHAN:But Mom, we found
this old skeleton with
a key in its hand, and-

19:15.502 --> 19:17.678
GRANDPA: Key?
Let me see that key!

19:17.852 --> 19:21.421
LISA: I don't care! Why
would you lie to me?
Why are you doing this?

19:22.422 --> 19:23.597
Only honest Abe knows.

19:24.728 --> 19:26.556
Don't you pull that on me.

19:26.730 --> 19:29.733
That stupid little phrase has
haunted us for generations.

19:29.907 --> 19:34.564
You will not end up like
every other failed James
man in this family!

19:35.696 --> 19:37.263

[Tobi barks]

19:37.437 --> 19:40.091
I'll help him with the report.
[doorbell rings]

19:40.266 --> 19:44.879
It should be on Jesse
James. He is his great,
great, great grandfather.

19:46.794 --> 19:48.404
DONIPHAN: Did you all miss
the whole "dead body" thing?

19:48.578 --> 19:50.014
LISA: No dad! And Doniphan
I don't wanna hear another lie!

19:50.189 --> 19:53.148
DONIPHAN: It's a dead body mom!-
LISA: ENOUGH!

19:53.322 --> 19:57.718
GRANDPA: that's something
this family knows. We can use
that to get his report up.

20:00.155 --> 20:01.765

isn't a bad time.

20:01.939 --> 20:06.030

It's fine. Come on in

20:06.205 --> 20:08.381

to speak to Eddie.

20:08.555 --> 20:10.209
LISA: We can all sit right
here and talk, Ben.

20:10.383 --> 20:12.689

the entire dead body thing?

20:13.908 --> 20:15.562

20:15.736 --> 20:18.652
BEN FORD: Montgomery won.
He fired me at the plant today.

20:21.176 --> 20:25.267
Well, actually, he concocted
some way to get me to transfered
out of town... to Illinois.

20:27.269 --> 20:30.011
REBECCA: He's forcing
Ben, Jackson and I
from our home Lisa.

20:30.185 --> 20:32.143
He's gonna get the house.

20:33.580 --> 20:35.799
JACKSON: Why would he
want OUR house?

20:35.973 --> 20:38.237
GRANDPA: It's not the
house he wants, it's
what's under that property.

20:39.020 --> 20:40.369
BEN: What? Empty caves?

20:40.543 --> 20:42.284
GRANDPA: OH They're not empty.

20:42.458 --> 20:44.895
We have been under that man's
thumb as long as I can remember

20:45.069 --> 20:47.942
and paying rent on property that
I know belongs to our family.

20:48.116 --> 20:49.639
LISA: No one has ever proven
that Ben. [Tobi barking]

20:49.813 --> 20:51.989
REBECCA: And no one ever will.
[Tobi barking]

20:52.163 --> 20:56.037
LISA: Maybe it's time
that we all move... and
put the curse to rest.

20:57.430 --> 20:59.040
BEN: What about the kids?

20:59.214 --> 21:00.650

just get another job?

21:02.043 --> 21:04.524
BEN: I wish I could.

21:04.698 --> 21:08.136
Montgomery owns this town.
He has everyone thinking
that I killed Doniphan's dad.

21:09.833 --> 21:12.967
My best friend?
I can't go nowhere

21:14.142 --> 21:15.274
LISA: Not everyone Ben.

21:17.667 --> 21:21.018
REBECCA: He uses this against
Ben every time he tries
to stop working for him.

21:21.192 --> 21:23.369
BEN: He has me on a noose.

21:23.543 --> 21:25.849
GRANDPA: We all know
that wasn't your fault!

21:26.023 --> 21:27.634

matters.

21:36.773 --> 21:41.082
That cave, the Treasure,

21:41.256 --> 21:45.086
they are nothing but a
dark curse that comes
after every James boy

21:45.260 --> 21:47.436

always be under Monty's buckle

is enough. [Tobi barking]

us to the punch.

boy has tried to make it right

22:07.674 --> 22:08.979
and failed...

22:09.153 --> 22:11.852
Maybe we should all move away.

22:12.026 --> 22:16.683
Tuck tail and run. Or maybe we
finally have a reason to fight.

like we lost his father.

has gone after this lost

is still there

30:51.414 --> 30:55.592
and made their home into
an underground mining operation.

30:55.766 --> 31:00.336
Well the ghosts of those Indians
still live in those caves.

31:00.510 --> 31:05.124
Jesse and Robert struck some
kind of deal with these spirits

31:05.298 --> 31:08.954
to show them a way out in
exchange for the treasure.

31:09.128 --> 31:13.088
HOPE: A deal
with Native American ghosts?

31:13.262 --> 31:17.353
GRANDPA: Legend tells...
spirits took the treasure

31:17.527 --> 31:21.923
but it wasn't enough.
They wanted blood.

31:22.097 --> 31:24.883
So, they took the
rest of Jesse's men.

31:25.927 --> 31:28.321
JACKSON: Let me see that!

31:28.495 --> 31:31.890
GRANDPA: Robert and Jesse
escaped but not before spirits
put a curse on the both of them.

31:35.719 --> 31:40.376
No one knows how they
got out, and no one's
ever seen the treasure.

31:42.248 --> 31:45.599
Thats why he left a trail of
clues and maps in his journal,

31:48.123 --> 31:51.344
but he left out just enough
information that no one
could go back without him.

31:54.086 --> 31:57.611
But as the curse would have
it Robert Ford shot Jesse in
the back and killed him dead

31:59.482 --> 32:02.398
before he'd tell anybody
where the treasure was...

32:02.572 --> 32:04.444

32:10.798 --> 32:13.279
[thunder]

32:16.456 --> 32:21.156
[sounds of water]

32:30.122 --> 32:33.647
JACKSON: So if we find the
treasure, we find the Will?

32:33.821 --> 32:37.303
And that proves that my family
has always owned the land?

32:37.477 --> 32:42.134
DONIPHAN: Look, my
great, great grandfather
failed. His son failed.

32:42.308 --> 32:46.965
My dad... he died! All for
this stupid cursed treasure!?

32:49.358 --> 32:51.230
What makes you think we'll
find it! What even makes
you think we'll make it?

32:51.404 --> 32:54.146
HOPE: Montgomery won't
stop here. Someone has
to step up and stop him.

32:54.320 --> 32:57.714
Is it dangerous?
Yeah. It is.

32:57.888 --> 33:00.587
But think of what it means
for both both of your families.

33:00.761 --> 33:03.590
Think of what it means
for all of us.

33:03.764 --> 33:05.592
your dad didn't have
this key.

33:05.766 --> 33:08.247
You're talking about a whole
unexplored underground world

33:08.421 --> 33:10.727
We don't know anything
about those caves.

33:10.901 --> 33:13.774
Look right here in this
book. It just looks like
a maze of who knows what?

33:13.948 --> 33:16.777
And what is that? Some
underground water tunnel thing?

33:16.951 --> 33:19.301
Guys we've never been in there!

33:19.475 --> 33:23.088
HOPE: This book has been
there. We have more clues
than anyone did before us.

33:23.262 --> 33:26.091
Jesse James always
intended to go back.

33:26.265 --> 33:28.919
Maybe the time has come.

33:29.094 --> 33:31.270
This sounds like the start
of an adventure.

33:31.444 --> 33:33.881
[thunder rubbling]

33:34.055 --> 33:37.798
[rain]

33:47.808 --> 33:51.203
JACKSON: Let's say we do
this. I'm not saying we
are, but let's just say.

33:51.377 --> 33:54.467
These caves run under
woods that go on forever,

33:54.641 --> 33:57.644
all the way to the river
and maybe beyond!

33:57.818 --> 33:59.863
How do we even know
where to start?

34:00.038 --> 34:01.604
HOPE: Where we found the key.

34:01.778 --> 34:05.347
DONIPHAN: The Fort. But,
even if we do find the lock box,

34:05.521 --> 34:07.915
it has two keys.
We only have one.

34:08.089 --> 34:11.745
JACKSON: This picture
shows a key that looks
like it goes to a gun?

34:11.919 --> 34:14.226
Like maybe it opens the handle.

34:14.400 --> 34:17.055
HOPE: Or maybe it's in
the handle.

34:17.229 --> 34:19.405
DONIPHAN: Hey! Montgomery found
a pistol with a white handle

34:19.579 --> 34:20.841
while he was mining in
the caves last month.

34:21.015 --> 34:22.277
It was all over everyone's
phone!

34:22.451 --> 34:25.019
HOPE: No telling where
he hid that.

34:25.193 --> 34:28.022
JACKSON: In plain sight. I
saw it this morning in a glass
case in Montgomery's office!

34:28.196 --> 34:29.763
It's right there!

34:29.937 --> 34:32.940
HOPE: You see? There's
something greater going on here.

34:33.114 --> 34:37.379
It's like fate picked
this moment to bring
all this together.

34:37.553 --> 34:40.730
All of us together,
to see what we're made of.

34:40.904 --> 34:44.908
To change history and
write a new legend.
Our legend. We need -

34:45.083 --> 34:46.649
CRICKET: -the second key!

34:46.823 --> 34:47.650
HOPE: CRICKET!

34:47.824 --> 34:49.478
HEY GET OUT OF HERE!

34:49.652 --> 34:53.047
JACKSON: OK, but the gun
is in a glass case, locked,

34:53.221 --> 34:56.442
in Montgomery's office! How
are we going to pull that off?

34:56.616 --> 34:58.618
DONIPHAN: If we can get
there, I can get us in.

34:58.792 --> 34:59.836
HOPE: What do you mean?

35:00.010 --> 35:01.795
DONIPHAN: I'm a James boy!

35:01.969 --> 35:04.450
I broke into school a few
times to change my grades.

35:04.624 --> 35:07.105
JACKSON: What?

35:07.279 --> 35:08.976
DONIPHAN: Middle School
didn't really work out.
They had an alarm system.

35:09.150 --> 35:11.587
JACKSON: You're a thief?!

35:11.761 --> 35:14.721
DONIPHAN: I never stole
anything. I just... changed
some grades. A few times.

35:14.895 --> 35:18.203
GRANDPA: Take the book
son. You're going to need it.

35:18.377 --> 35:21.597
It's everyday good deeds
that keep darkness at bay,

35:21.771 --> 35:23.338
and you kids are good.

35:23.512 --> 35:24.774
DONIPHAN: Come with us Grandpa!

35:24.948 --> 35:27.081
GRANDPA: I love a good
adventure

35:27.255 --> 35:30.476
but my time has passed.
I'd only hold you back.

35:30.650 --> 35:35.220
You can call me though. and
I'll be like Batman's Alfred,

35:35.394 --> 35:38.440
ready to hop on those
internet tubes and save the day.

35:38.614 --> 35:40.094
[laughing]

35:41.617 --> 35:43.750
DONIPHAN: You should
keep hold of the key.

35:43.924 --> 35:46.622
It will be a lot safer
with you, but just keep
it under your shirt.

35:48.189 --> 35:50.060
HOPE: Alright, now what?

35:51.932 --> 35:54.195
DONIPHAN: If we're
gonna get that pistol
out of Monty's office,

35:54.369 --> 35:57.329
we're gonna need some
wheels... Pippin.

35:57.503 --> 36:01.507
JACKSON: Pippin! She farts...
They really smell.

36:08.644 --> 36:13.345
[dramatic music]

36:23.964 --> 36:28.664
RED CLOAK: These are not
patient men I work for Monty.

36:30.405 --> 36:34.279
They get what they want...
they get results.

36:35.454 --> 36:38.761
They want. . . their treasure.

36:38.935 --> 36:40.676
MONTGOMERY: I have the key

36:40.850 --> 36:42.112
RED CLOAK: To what?

36:42.287 --> 36:43.984
MONTGOMERY: I'm working
on that.

36:44.158 --> 36:47.292
RED CLOAK: You made a deal.

36:47.466 --> 36:52.166
They are giving you three
days to hold up your end of it.

36:53.298 --> 36:55.604
MONTGOMERY: I need more
time than that!

36:55.778 --> 36:59.173
RED CLOAK: Three days, Monty!...

36:59.347 --> 37:02.655
after that we can no
longer protect you.

37:02.829 --> 37:05.092
[thunder]

37:14.275 --> 37:19.237
[ringing]

37:22.979 --> 37:24.503
PIPPIN: Hello?

37:24.677 --> 37:27.462
DONIPHAN: Pippin. It's Doniphan.
I need a huge favor.

37:27.636 --> 37:30.813
I need you to meet us at
the barn tomorrow right
after your driver's test.

37:30.987 --> 37:35.253
Oh and no pressure. You
HAVE TO PASS, or else
everything is ruined!

37:36.384 --> 37:37.429
...Okay?

37:38.212 --> 37:39.605
[door slams]

37:41.171 --> 37:42.260
MONTGOMERY: LISTEN UP!

37:44.958 --> 37:47.700
I'm only going to say
this once!

37:50.355 --> 37:53.183
You're gonna get in
there... you're gonna
tear these caverns apart!

37:53.358 --> 37:55.098
You're gonna find my treasure

37:58.276 --> 38:02.628
and I'm gonna pay you
double if that treasure
is in my hand by morning!

38:04.760 --> 38:06.240
Got it?

38:07.067 --> 38:09.287
ALRIGHT! GET TO WORK!

38:13.769 --> 38:15.118
[door closes]

38:15.293 --> 38:17.120
[playful music]

38:18.383 --> 38:20.254
CRICKET: I'm feeling kinda
hungry.

38:20.428 --> 38:24.040
Maybe I'll wake mom up and
ask her to cook us breakfast

38:24.214 --> 38:27.914
DONIPHAN: Jeez Cricket...
Fine! You can go!

38:28.088 --> 38:29.785
CRICKET: YES!

38:36.749 --> 38:39.534
JACKSON: What is he doing
here!? He can't come with us!

38:39.708 --> 38:41.406
DONIPHAN: I don't wanna
talk about it.

38:42.494 --> 38:44.234
CRICKET: I made
sandwiches

38:45.758 --> 38:47.455
DONIPHAN: Ready for one
last great adventure?

38:47.629 --> 38:49.631
JACKSON: this could be
a complete waste of time.

38:49.805 --> 38:51.807
HOPE: It could be the
best moment of our lives.

38:51.981 --> 38:53.069
DONIPHAN: You got
something better to do?

38:53.243 --> 38:55.420
JACKSON: [sigh]
Lets go

38:55.594 --> 38:57.247
DONIPHAN: If Pippin doesn't
pass this morning,

38:57.422 --> 38:59.685
this could be the shortest
adventure we've ever had.

39:01.948 --> 39:03.428
CRICKET: Hold this

39:03.602 --> 39:04.907
DONIPHAN: [grrr]

39:05.691 --> 39:08.302
[engine running]

I'm nervous...

39:13.046 --> 39:14.613
I fart too...

Let's get THIS over with.

39:19.269 --> 39:21.489
PIPPIN: ooooh... sorry

39:21.663 --> 39:24.274

to pull to the end of the
block, and make a left

39:24.449 --> 39:25.798

take it a little easier
on the gas and brakes.

39:54.261 --> 39:56.089

39:58.961 --> 39:59.701

39:59.875 --> 40:00.963
PIPPIN: YES!

40:01.137 --> 40:02.269
INSTRUCTOR: Barely...

40:03.183 --> 40:04.967
And I mean barely.

40:05.141 --> 40:07.927
I'm gonna chalk this
one up to inexpirience.

40:08.101 --> 40:11.670
Find a calm, safe place
to practice... and don't
make me regret this.

41:00.066 --> 41:01.328
PIPPIN: Aced it.

41:02.677 --> 41:04.200
JACKSON: What was
exactly your score?

41:04.374 --> 41:05.288

41:06.464 --> 41:07.029
Do you spell that with a "D"?

of you here that can drive!

41:12.600 --> 41:14.602
DONIPHAN: Alright, everybody hop
in. We're running out of time.

41:14.776 --> 41:15.777
I'll explain on the way.

41:15.951 --> 41:16.952
PIPPIN: Okay. I'm in

41:18.476 --> 41:20.782
CRICKET: I'm Hungry!..
Can we eat now?

41:22.697 --> 41:25.657
DONIPHAN: Man Jesse James was
the greatest adventurer ever!

41:25.831 --> 41:28.181
JACKSON: He's also the
guy who got my family
kicked off the land.

41:29.225 --> 41:30.923
CRICKET: What is that?

41:31.097 --> 41:32.838
DONIPHAN: I don't know.
Looks like a top hat I guess

41:33.012 --> 41:34.404
JACKSON: I still think
thats water.

41:34.579 --> 41:36.929
PIPPIN: Okay so...
what's going on?

41:37.103 --> 41:38.800
HOPE: Well, we have one key...

41:38.974 --> 41:41.586
CRICKET: We need the
second key from monty.

41:41.760 --> 41:43.370
JACKSON: Then we use the book to
find the teasure and the Will.

41:43.544 --> 41:45.024
DONIPHAN: So we can
stop Jackson from leaving.

41:45.198 --> 41:47.374
JACKSON: Now...
Can we go any faster?

Dude, I can't believe you
broke into elementary school.

HOPE :I can't believe you
changed your grades.

help me. I've got it!

42:50.568 --> 42:51.873

42:52.047 --> 42:52.744

open the handle

42:52.918 --> 42:54.397
CRICKET: Woahhhh

42:54.572 --> 42:55.877
DONIPHAN: Hopefully like this.

PIPPIN: Look! I'ts hanging
around Monty's neck!

43:11.806 --> 43:15.767
HOPE: I bet he wears it there
all the time! A necklace
like that you don't take off.

43:15.941 --> 43:18.770
JACKSON: Or it's hidden at
his house...

43:18.944 --> 43:20.728
PIPPIN: We've already
broken into one place.

43:20.902 --> 43:22.600
DONIPHAN: Well... looks like
we're going to Monty's house!

43:28.562 --> 43:31.173
DONIPHAN: The doors
are locked. I don't see
anyone in the windows.

43:31.347 --> 43:33.567
There are vehicles out front but
I don't think anyone is here.

43:34.829 --> 43:36.396
DONIPHAN: Are you
sure about this?

43:36.570 --> 43:36.962
DONIPHAN: Let's just get
our stuff and stick to the plan.

43:44.926 --> 43:47.755
JACKSON: A doggie door?
What if Cujo's in there?

43:47.929 --> 43:50.540
CRICKET: Or a doberman
or something.

43:50.715 --> 43:52.499
DONIPHAN: Probably some
little, yappy wiener dog.

43:52.673 --> 43:54.849
HOPE: Not with a dog
door that big!

43:55.023 --> 43:57.939
DONIPHAN: Probably doesn't
even have a dog. Maybe
it's just for show?

43:58.113 --> 44:01.247
Alright little brother,
you're up. You wanted to help.

44:01.421 --> 44:03.118
You're the only one who
can fit through that door.

45:00.480 --> 45:03.744
DONIPHAN: The key is hanging
around his neck.

45:03.918 --> 45:06.486
ow do we get it off...
The fishing rod!

45:06.660 --> 45:11.317
JACKSON: no no no
no, thats a bad idea.

I got it!

you found your hat.

Good thing your brother
didn't drown while you
were searching for it!

Let it go man. You are
not Jesse James.

1:06:19.845 --> 1:06:22.761

It's my dad's hat.

you don't understand.

JACKSON: You are not
your dad! And you don't
wanna be Jesse James.

1:06:30.464 --> 1:06:32.858
He killed and stole for slavery.

1:06:33.032 --> 1:06:35.861
He was a bank robber,
not a super hero.

1:06:36.035 --> 1:06:36.862
Even his friends turned on him!

after money that Jesse stole.

1:06:40.779 --> 1:06:42.563
DONIPHAN: It was bank money
from Montgomery's family.

1:06:42.737 --> 1:06:45.523
JACKSON: It was the town's
money. That Jesse killed for.

1:06:45.697 --> 1:06:48.004
That makes it blood money!

cause we're all gonna
die if we don't move now

here! Should we take it?

1:06:54.314 --> 1:06:55.359
PIPPIN: Maybe we should
check the book?

1:06:57.709 --> 1:07:00.190

figure it out.

1:07:00.364 --> 1:07:01.930
No no no!

1:07:06.674 --> 1:07:08.024
It's gone.

but you always do this,

1:07:12.071 --> 1:07:15.205
but come this Monday, if we
even make it out of here alive,

1:07:15.379 --> 1:07:18.730
I won't be here to save your
brother. I won't be here to
help you with your report.

1:07:18.904 --> 1:07:20.819
I won't be here to finish
the fort.

1:07:20.993 --> 1:07:22.951
You have to finish what
you started this time.

1:07:30.916 --> 1:07:32.744
DONIPHAN: I lost the book.

1:07:32.918 --> 1:07:34.746
I almost killed my brother,

1:07:34.920 --> 1:07:37.053
and now we're lost
in Montgomery's cave

1:07:38.750 --> 1:07:40.491
Was I a hinder-dance?

1:07:44.669 --> 1:07:47.237
PIPPIN: Wow. I did not realize
I was signing up for some

1:07:47.411 --> 1:07:49.717
sappy, dramatic,

1:07:49.891 --> 1:07:53.112
deficating all over each other,
depressing brotherly moment.

1:07:53.286 --> 1:07:54.983
JACKSON: Is deficating
even a word?

1:07:56.333 --> 1:07:58.378
PIPPIN: Look. We've been shot
at,

1:07:58.552 --> 1:08:00.119
we've been attacked
by a dog, we've been
chased at high speeds,

1:08:00.293 --> 1:08:01.686
we've drowned in a lake,

1:08:01.860 --> 1:08:04.732
I'm cold and wet, my
hair is ruined,

1:08:04.906 --> 1:08:08.432
and not to mention if
we don't get going soon,
we're going to die!

1:08:10.216 --> 1:08:11.522
JACKSON: Well If I die I
don't have to move on Monday.

1:08:11.696 --> 1:08:13.698
CRICKET: You look stupid in that
hat anyway.

1:08:15.700 --> 1:08:17.615
Is that really why you wear it?

1:08:18.572 --> 1:08:19.617
DONIPHAN: Well...

1:08:19.791 --> 1:08:21.097
That hat is not dad Doniphan.

1:08:22.402 --> 1:08:23.447
Dad's in here.

1:08:30.671 --> 1:08:34.110
CRICKET: Are we gonna sit here
or are we gonna do something?

1:08:36.068 --> 1:08:37.330
DONIPHAN: You're
right little buddy.

1:08:39.158 --> 1:08:42.466
We've made it this far.
Further than dad ever did.

1:08:42.640 --> 1:08:44.772
CRICKET: Dad would
want us to go on.

1:08:44.946 --> 1:08:46.470
This is a great adventure.

1:08:47.993 --> 1:08:50.256
We're gonna stop
Jackson from leaving.

1:09:02.921 --> 1:09:05.053
DONIPHAN: Well, we can
swim toward the bad guys

1:09:05.228 --> 1:09:06.881
or follow this opening,
and see where it goes.

1:09:07.055 --> 1:09:08.144

DONIPHAN: I know this ring.

1:10:45.763 --> 1:10:46.720
I used to play with it while
he shaved.

1:17:13.803 --> 1:17:16.893
Guys, Get it?
It's a play on words!

1:17:17.067 --> 1:17:19.765
Honest Abe's nose!

1:17:19.939 --> 1:17:21.767
It was right under
his nose all this time.

1:17:21.941 --> 1:17:24.117
HOPE: Does that one look
like Papa Smurf?

1:17:24.291 --> 1:17:28.905
DONIPHAN: what? no.
Look right there! It's
a pile of ... clothes??

1:17:29.079 --> 1:17:30.689
JACKSON: That's gotta
be it! Let's climb
down there and get it!

1:17:30.863 --> 1:17:32.473
PIPPIN: Uh, can you CLIMB
a rope?

1:17:32.648 --> 1:17:34.127
CRICKET: You can
lower me down.

1:17:35.259 --> 1:17:36.652
HOPE: And I'll go with him.

1:17:39.132 --> 1:17:40.133
It's Okay.

1:17:42.832 --> 1:17:45.008
JESSE: They must really want
their money back! You don't
ever go through lock boxes!

1:17:45.182 --> 1:17:48.098
Frank knew not to go
through lock boxes.
I blame you for this!

1:17:48.272 --> 1:17:50.361
you gave them too much
time to gather their men!

1:17:50.535 --> 1:17:52.276
CHARLIE: You got the loot!

1:17:52.450 --> 1:17:53.886
JESSEL What good's the loot
do me if I can't spend it!?

1:17:54.060 --> 1:17:56.454
ROBERT: Ah! Quit cha
belly achin'..You...

1:17:56.628 --> 1:17:58.456
JESSE: I blame you for this
Robert Ford! This is your
fault! It's your fault!

1:17:58.630 --> 1:17:59.892
ROBERT: It's my father's fault!

1:18:00.066 --> 1:18:01.546
JESSE: Don't you ever sass
me boy!

1:18:05.245 --> 1:18:06.551
JACKSON: We have to go
one at a time.

1:18:07.770 --> 1:18:08.945
DONIPHAN: I gotchu okay?

1:18:10.729 --> 1:18:11.861
Just keep looking at me.

1:18:15.255 --> 1:18:17.518
PIPPIN: They can't be far
behind, we gotta hurry!

1:18:22.132 --> 1:18:24.003
JACKSON: Jesse and
Robert stood right here.

1:18:24.177 --> 1:18:27.050
DONIPHAN: Jesse and
Robert were trapped right here.

1:18:28.965 --> 1:18:31.881
HOPE: Jesse and Robert must
have been naked here. Weird!

1:18:38.714 --> 1:18:40.541
Well I'll be...

1:18:44.894 --> 1:18:46.678
How on earth?!

1:18:46.852 --> 1:18:48.898
It looks just like him.
Without the hat.

1:18:49.072 --> 1:18:50.769
ROBERT: Wondered if someone
chiseled him out?

1:18:51.857 --> 1:18:54.207
Only honest Abe knows ...

1:18:55.295 --> 1:18:58.298
Only honest Abe knows.

1:18:58.472 --> 1:18:59.299
[eerie noise]

1:18:59.473 --> 1:19:00.474
[growling]

1:19:03.434 --> 1:19:05.001
EVERYONE: C'mon we gotta go!
we gotta get out of here!

1:19:07.481 --> 1:19:10.789
JESSE: We're Swimmin' outta
here boys! Just like Harrison
said, It's right there!

1:19:10.963 --> 1:19:13.270
JESSE: No coins! we hide
the coins over there!

1:19:13.444 --> 1:19:15.489
Anything that weighs you
down, leave it! We'll
come back for it later.

1:19:15.663 --> 1:19:16.664
[deep bassy sound]

1:19:20.233 --> 1:19:21.974
DONIPHAN: they got out
somehow because the pistol

1:19:22.148 --> 1:19:23.933
made it from here to the
room with the wagon.

1:19:24.107 --> 1:19:25.064
JACKSON: A secret
way out from here?!

1:19:27.414 --> 1:19:29.808
Looks like they stripped off
everything that was heavy.

1:19:30.983 --> 1:19:32.289
They must have went underwater.

1:19:34.421 --> 1:19:36.162
HOPE: Which must lead
to the lake, and the
room with the wagon!

1:19:36.336 --> 1:19:38.817
JACKSON: It's a puddle,
which is under our fort!

1:19:38.991 --> 1:19:40.514
PIPPIN: So that
must be the way out!

1:19:42.299 --> 1:19:43.256
DONIPHAN: The same way out
Jesse took to escape the posse!

1:19:43.430 --> 1:19:44.867
JACKSON: I saw that in the book.

1:19:45.041 --> 1:19:46.782
The top hat, that must
be my boy Abe!

1:19:48.566 --> 1:19:50.916
DONIPHAN: An underwater
passage... thats it!
thats our way out!

1:19:53.266 --> 1:19:57.096
PIPPIN: I'm here for driving
purposes, not diving,

1:19:57.270 --> 1:20:01.144
and my hair is so
rashed already.

1:20:01.318 --> 1:20:03.929
HOPE: The treasure! It was
under the clothes!

1:20:04.103 --> 1:20:07.193
Sacks of coins! More
than we can carry!

1:20:07.367 --> 1:20:10.066
CRICKET: And there's old
guns and quick draw holsters!

1:20:10.240 --> 1:20:11.328
[rattling]

1:20:11.502 --> 1:20:12.503
... and a box?!

1:20:12.677 --> 1:20:13.852
DONIPHAN: The bank box?

1:20:14.026 --> 1:20:14.810
JACKSON: THE WILL!

1:20:16.028 --> 1:20:16.812
We're staying!

1:20:19.510 --> 1:20:21.817
[cheerful music]

1:20:32.262 --> 1:20:33.176
HOPE: Guys!!

1:20:35.700 --> 1:20:37.484
SAMUEL: This is my
official two weeks notice

1:20:37.658 --> 1:20:39.660
CLAY: Whatever, can we just find
these kids and get out of here?

1:20:41.271 --> 1:20:42.228
Which way?

1:20:44.100 --> 1:20:45.841
CLAY: Billy, I want
you to go find Cobb...

1:20:48.931 --> 1:20:49.845
... Billy?

1:20:51.281 --> 1:20:51.890
Billy?

1:20:53.761 --> 1:20:57.330
MONTGOMERY:
Boo! HAHAHAHA

1:20:57.504 --> 1:20:59.115
I got you boys good!

1:20:59.289 --> 1:21:00.986
CLAY: Whats the matter with you?

1:21:01.160 --> 1:21:02.814
MONTGOMERY: You look live you've
seen a ghost or something...

1:21:02.988 --> 1:21:05.338
MONTGOMERY: Hey, C'mon,
my treasure is this way.

1:21:07.601 --> 1:21:11.388
Boy... you stink.

1:21:15.958 --> 1:21:17.698
DONIPHAN: You know,
my phone really didn't
like that first swim!

1:21:17.873 --> 1:21:19.787
JACKSON: My phone's waterproof.

1:21:19.962 --> 1:21:22.399
PIPPIN: Guys, Come on, we
gotta go! Help me pull them up.

1:21:22.573 --> 1:21:25.271
JACKSON: ya know? we can't get
the will wet, either.

1:21:27.186 --> 1:21:29.188
DONIPHAN: Cricket!
You're a life-saver!

1:21:29.362 --> 1:21:30.059
CRICKET: Huh?

1:21:31.016 --> 1:21:31.712
DONIPHAN: Sandwiches

1:21:33.976 --> 1:21:35.760
Come on Cricket, we gotta go!

1:21:36.979 --> 1:21:38.850
Hey guys look at me!

1:21:39.024 --> 1:21:41.722
[ the kids struggling]

1:21:46.640 --> 1:21:47.641
HOPE: NO!

1:21:48.729 --> 1:21:49.513
DONIPHAN: Leave him alone!

1:21:49.687 --> 1:21:50.122
MONTGOMERY: Hahaha

1:21:51.297 --> 1:21:53.734
Tie 'em up with the
extra rope, boys.

1:21:53.909 --> 1:21:55.954
Thanks for bringing me
my treasure kids.

1:22:02.439 --> 1:22:06.312
CHARLIE: Jesse, I don't
know how far we'll have to
swim to get out of this.

1:22:06.486 --> 1:22:08.924
JESSE: I thought I told
you guns don't swim?

1:22:10.142 --> 1:22:11.796
[dramatic music]

1:22:15.931 --> 1:22:18.846
DONIPHAN: This is
nothing ya know. The real
treasure's down there.

1:22:20.631 --> 1:22:21.327
MONTGOMERY: [laughing]

1:22:22.807 --> 1:22:24.940
you are a terrible liar.

1:22:26.637 --> 1:22:28.813
Just like your dad.

1:22:28.987 --> 1:22:30.858
SAMUEL: I can see a whole
pile of stuff from here, boss.

1:22:31.033 --> 1:22:33.165
MONTGOMERY: Well get
down there then!

1:22:33.339 --> 1:22:34.950
Listen here ford boy!...

1:22:36.734 --> 1:22:38.562
That old will isn't gonna
save your family land.

1:22:38.736 --> 1:22:39.998
CLAY: What's the problem?

1:22:40.172 --> 1:22:40.956
SAMUEL: There's no rope...

1:22:45.090 --> 1:22:46.048
CLAY: Well they
got down there...

1:22:46.222 --> 1:22:47.745
CLAY: Yeah, with the rope!

1:22:49.660 --> 1:22:52.141
MONTGOMERY: My family's bank has
owned that land for generations.

1:22:52.315 --> 1:22:56.972
Master Ford, he paid off
the bank the same day he was
killed by his son, Robert.

1:23:01.106 --> 1:23:04.153
Right after that, Robert went
and robbed the bank!

1:23:04.327 --> 1:23:06.590
Of course the bank had to
hold their land as collateral.

1:23:06.764 --> 1:23:07.721
JACKSON: That's deficant.

1:23:07.895 --> 1:23:08.984
PIPPIN: That's not a word.

1:23:09.158 --> 1:23:10.507
DONIPHAN: That's not legal.

1:23:10.681 --> 1:23:12.117
MONTGOMERY: And who
was going to contest it?

1:23:12.291 --> 1:23:16.861
His son, the theif?
His wife, the slave?

1:23:18.732 --> 1:23:22.910
No, you kids are going to come
to a treacherous end here...

1:23:24.651 --> 1:23:28.090
accidentally, in these caverns.
Just like Doniphans dad.

1:23:30.875 --> 1:23:34.183
Yeah, I killed him too.

1:23:34.357 --> 1:23:37.490
CLAY: Boss, uh, you might
wanna come here.

1:23:37.664 --> 1:23:39.014
There really is more down here.

1:23:39.840 --> 1:23:40.363
MONTGOMERY: Okay

1:23:46.934 --> 1:23:48.893
I win Robert Ford...

1:23:50.199 --> 1:23:51.983
DONIPHAN: Go, quick!
into the water!

1:23:52.157 --> 1:23:56.335
MONTGOMERY: Lets go bury that
boy with his dear old dead dad.

1:23:59.425 --> 1:24:00.122
HEY!

1:24:13.961 --> 1:24:16.007
Follow 'em. We'll drown 'em!

I love you ok?

1:25:24.075 --> 1:25:25.424
HARRIETTE: What about daddy?

1:25:26.556 --> 1:25:27.905

MONTGOMERY: Deputy Stone.

are requesting another unit
to assist with burglary

1:31:15.470 --> 1:31:17.080
PIPPIN: ren't they supposed
to arrest the bad guys?

1:31:17.254 --> 1:31:19.474
MONTGOMERY: Thank god
you are here Sheriff Angela.

1:31:21.214 --> 1:31:25.392
These kids broke into my private
property and stole my ...

1:31:25.567 --> 1:31:28.700
MONTGOMERY [RECORDING]: you
kids are going to come to
a treacherous end here...

1:31:28.874 --> 1:31:32.487
accidentally, in these caverns.

1:31:32.661 --> 1:31:35.098
Just like Doniphans dad.

1:31:35.272 --> 1:31:37.927
Yeah, I killed him too.

1:31:39.494 --> 1:31:40.625
JACKSON: Waterproof, baby!

1:31:42.453 --> 1:31:44.150
DONIPHAN: We also have
evidence that the Ford land

1:31:44.324 --> 1:31:46.849
has belonged to the Jackson's
family for more than 100 years.

1:31:47.023 --> 1:31:51.418
HOPE: Neither Mr. South
or his bank can force the
Fords off their property

1:31:51.593 --> 1:31:54.509
or continue to charge them for
a mortgage that never existed.

1:31:54.683 --> 1:31:59.339
In fact, Mr. South and his
bank owes my family over
100 years worth of rent.

accusations kids.

what I think they do,

wanted out of this relationship,

1:32:31.807 --> 1:32:33.199
ANGELA: Take care of this.

1:32:33.373 --> 1:32:33.765
MALE DETECTIVE 1:
Take care of this...

1:32:39.641 --> 1:32:42.948
OFFICERS: anything you
say can and will be used
against you in a court of law

1:32:43.122 --> 1:32:44.820
You have the right to an
attorney

1:32:44.994 --> 1:32:47.344
if you can't afford one the
court will appoint one for you.

1:32:47.518 --> 1:32:49.259
Do you understand these rights
as I have read them to you?

1:32:50.956 --> 1:32:52.436
[slap]

1:32:52.610 --> 1:32:54.046
FEMALE DETECTIVE:
Bonehead it's evidence!

1:32:54.220 --> 1:32:54.612

1:32:56.658 --> 1:32:57.833
LISA: Boys!

1:32:58.007 --> 1:32:58.790
DONIPHAN & CRICKET:

1:32:58.964 --> 1:33:00.313
LISA: are you ok?

1:33:00.487 --> 1:33:01.532
DONIPHAN: Mom,
we're fine. I Promise.

1:33:02.838 --> 1:33:04.100
HOPE: How did you
guys even find us?

1:33:06.189 --> 1:33:08.583
ANGELA: Well, Doniphan's
mom called in a missing
persons this morning

1:33:08.757 --> 1:33:12.325
but then your grandpa used
your cell phone's GPS to
pinpoint your exact location

1:33:12.499 --> 1:33:14.197
then emailed us a map.

1:33:16.286 --> 1:33:19.289
STONE: And I discovered
a small clue to validate
your entire story.

1:33:19.463 --> 1:33:20.595
DONIPHAN: Grandpa?

1:33:20.769 --> 1:33:22.988
GRANDPA: Batman's Alfred.

1:33:23.162 --> 1:33:24.816
LISA: We're just really
glad you guys are all OK.

1:33:32.519 --> 1:33:35.261
DONIPHAN: I know you
entrusted me with the journal

1:33:35.435 --> 1:33:38.308
that's been in our family
for generations, but

1:33:38.482 --> 1:33:41.050
in the adventure I lost it

1:33:42.007 --> 1:33:43.008
GRANDPA: It's okay son!

1:33:43.182 --> 1:33:45.707
DONIPHAN: What?!

1:33:45.881 --> 1:33:49.145
GRANDPA: Before I gave you
the book, I scanned all
the pages into a PDF file,

1:33:51.713 --> 1:33:54.629
and uploaded them into a
password encrypted website
on the Internet Tubes!

1:33:57.632 --> 1:33:59.503
MONTGOMERY: I would have
gotten my treasure too
if it wasn't for those

1:33:59.677 --> 1:34:01.026
puny little pieces of . . .

1:34:01.200 --> 1:34:02.027
[slam]

1:34:02.201 --> 1:34:03.159
[Tobi barking]

1:34:04.639 --> 1:34:06.031
BEN: Looks like you
won't be moving.

1:34:06.205 --> 1:34:08.468
BEN: I'm being promoted
to manager of the plant.

1:34:08.643 --> 1:34:10.557
REBECCA: He's taking
Monty's old job.

1:34:10.732 --> 1:34:12.255
GRANDPA: Right where
you belong.

1:34:12.429 --> 1:34:14.257
LISA: I can't believe
you did it.

1:34:14.431 --> 1:34:16.433
I'm so proud. I'm proud

1:34:16.607 --> 1:34:18.261
of both of you

1:34:18.435 --> 1:34:21.656
GRANDPA: This is a heavy weight
off the James name, boys.

1:34:23.266 --> 1:34:25.572
You've made us ALL proud.

1:34:25.747 --> 1:34:28.575
It's Gonna take a lot of legal
action to get things back, but

1:34:28.750 --> 1:34:30.969
it's gonna happen.

1:34:31.143 --> 1:34:34.494
LISA: Maybe you can use
a bit of that treasure
to pay some of it off?

1:34:34.669 --> 1:34:36.540
YHOPE: eah? I'm sure
there's plenty of it.

1:34:36.714 --> 1:34:38.673
DONIPHAN: More than plenty.

1:34:41.588 --> 1:34:46.289
[sounds of the familes playing
games]

1:34:49.292 --> 1:34:52.164
DONIPHAN [REPORT]: Legends
aren't always about heroes.

1:34:52.338 --> 1:34:55.080
I thought a hero was just
what I saw in old movies,

1:34:55.254 --> 1:34:59.737
but it's much more
than ust busting bad
guys and adventures...

1:34:59.911 --> 1:35:04.829
It's caring about others
more than yourself.

1:35:05.003 --> 1:35:09.355
A real hero doesn't just do
things because that's the
way it's awlays been done.

1:35:09.529 --> 1:35:13.838
They do what's right,
despite the odds.

1:35:14.012 --> 1:35:17.712
And the real treasure in life
are the people we care about

1:35:17.886 --> 1:35:19.452
HOPE: I like you're report

1:35:19.626 --> 1:35:20.889
DONIPHAN: and those who
care about us.

1:35:35.730 --> 1:35:37.079
DONIPHAN: Thank you!

1:35:37.253 --> 1:35:38.907
JACKSON: For what?

1:35:39.081 --> 1:35:40.386
DONIPHAN: For the greatest
adventure of my life!...

1:35:40.560 --> 1:35:42.084
and also the Jackson Five.

1:35:42.258 --> 1:35:43.825
JACKSON: Dude that was
like so last century...

1:35:43.999 --> 1:35:47.959
How about, the fantastic four.

1:35:48.133 --> 1:35:50.962
HOPE: No we should definitely
go with flower power!

1:35:51.136 --> 1:35:52.529
PIPPIN: I think it should
be Pippy Pals

1:35:52.703 --> 1:35:54.879
CRICKET: What about the
Cricket Rangers!

1:35:55.053 --> 1:35:59.275
DONIPHAN: Or how about
none of those, and we
go with... The Goonies!

1:38:37.520 --> 1:38:38.913
BILLY: Guys...

1:38:43.395 --> 1:38:44.092
Guys!....

1:38:47.399 --> 1:38:48.923
GUYS!!!!!!!
