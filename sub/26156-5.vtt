WEBVTT

00:00.040 --> 00:03.961
People of Manchester, we salute you!

00:03.987 --> 00:06.266
Caroline McCoy faked her
own assassination attempt

00:06.267 --> 00:08.386
so she could swing the
vote and win the election.

00:08.387 --> 00:10.707
She even smuggled the gun
into the town hall for Beckett.

00:11.269 --> 00:13.908
We have the start of a paper
trail linking Caroline to Dirkin.

00:13.909 --> 00:16.062
If you help them, then who knows?

00:16.087 --> 00:18.788
- I turned Dennis.
- This in inhuman.

00:20.475 --> 00:22.164
We'll contact Beckett
when the time is right,

00:22.189 --> 00:23.708
arrange the meet and we'll have him.

00:23.709 --> 00:26.766
And once we've got him,
we can take down Caroline too.

00:26.767 --> 00:28.667
Do you think she's worked out
that you're onto her?

00:28.668 --> 00:30.068
- Yes, ma'am.
- Mayor's on her way in.

00:30.069 --> 00:32.828
Needs to talk urgently about alleged
corruption in my department.

00:32.829 --> 00:34.610
That's code for I want you out.

00:34.685 --> 00:36.125
There is only one way to fix this.

00:36.150 --> 00:37.709
I'm resigning.

00:37.710 --> 00:40.004
I'll be gone by the end of the week.

00:41.510 --> 00:44.629
And as new mayor, I'm proud to
say that I've kept my promise.

00:44.630 --> 00:48.629
A zero tolerance policy on
parking in restricted zones

00:48.630 --> 00:51.589
right across Manchester,
starting right here, right now.

00:51.590 --> 00:52.869
Why outside a mosque?

00:52.870 --> 00:55.629
No hidden agenda, it's one of the
many areas, across the city,

00:55.630 --> 00:59.630
where parking is an issue.

01:02.710 --> 01:07.440
I'll take this up with the mayor
later but for now, please, inside.

01:07.550 --> 01:08.869
Easy, boys and girls.

01:08.870 --> 01:11.140
Slippers, not jack boots.

01:13.101 --> 01:14.860
Is he having a laugh?

01:16.190 --> 01:17.869
Captain Big Box.

01:17.870 --> 01:19.273
Deal with him.

01:20.310 --> 01:21.940
Oi!

01:22.550 --> 01:24.149
Stop that box!

01:24.150 --> 01:26.000
Excuse me.

01:30.550 --> 01:32.829
Conspicuous policing?

01:32.830 --> 01:35.909
This is all bells,
whistles and tit tassels.

01:35.910 --> 01:38.109
Here comes the new Marilyn.

01:38.110 --> 01:42.110
Detective Chief Inspector Terry
Taylor is just the man for the job.

01:42.820 --> 01:45.229
Inspector, you keep the locals back,
I'll deal with that lot.

01:45.230 --> 01:46.909
These are the locals, sir.

01:46.910 --> 01:48.749
Right, you two, there's more of them

01:48.750 --> 01:50.669
trying to park up round
the corner. See to it.

01:50.670 --> 01:54.670
PC O'Connell, let Tiggy go
first. They might listen to her.

01:54.750 --> 01:56.789
It's Tegan.

01:56.790 --> 01:58.669
We're not interrupting your prayers,

01:58.670 --> 02:01.460
go back and have your prayers.

02:02.310 --> 02:05.300
Get inside before someone gets hurt!

02:07.750 --> 02:09.309
Get him in the van!

02:09.310 --> 02:11.189
No, the other one!

02:11.190 --> 02:12.909
Get him off that lorry!

02:12.910 --> 02:15.149
This is all going to
go Dolly Parton tits up

02:15.150 --> 02:17.789
if Terry Dactyl doesn't stop
goose stepping his way through.

02:17.790 --> 02:19.393
Was he like this when you were a cadet?

02:19.418 --> 02:20.700
Worse.

02:21.430 --> 02:23.300
Jonah, where the hell are you?

02:27.070 --> 02:29.620
Just apprehended Big Box, ma'am.

02:30.950 --> 02:32.709
You're not Captain Big Box.

02:32.710 --> 02:34.309
You can't arrest them all, Sir.

02:34.310 --> 02:35.909
We've only got two cells free.

02:35.910 --> 02:38.029
The mayor brought me in for a reason.

02:38.030 --> 02:39.629
I stick to her agenda,

02:39.630 --> 02:42.780
you stick to mine,
we'll all be happy clampers.

02:44.790 --> 02:47.440
If you step over this line,
I will have you arrested.

02:47.441 --> 02:49.340
Forget that.

02:52.390 --> 02:53.589
You can't park there, lads.

02:53.590 --> 02:55.149
Since when?

02:55.150 --> 02:56.429
Since today...

02:56.430 --> 02:57.860
Bash?

02:58.270 --> 02:59.669
You need to move your car.

02:59.670 --> 03:02.549
Stu, I'll sort it, he's my cousin.

03:02.550 --> 03:03.909
No way.

03:03.910 --> 03:06.029
Bad enough you're a pig
but shagging a white pig?

03:06.030 --> 03:08.829
Don't speak to her like that.
Move your car.

03:08.830 --> 03:11.269
- Bash...
- Get off me.

03:11.270 --> 03:13.420
Move your car now!

03:15.340 --> 03:18.140
- God, are you OK?
- Shit.

03:20.000 --> 03:26.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:36.350 --> 03:39.469
Bashir Khan, I'm arresting you
for assaulting a police officer.

03:39.470 --> 03:41.309
Whoa, whoa, whoa, what you playing at?

03:41.310 --> 03:42.869
Make the most of it, mate,

03:42.870 --> 03:44.909
cos she might be goin'
on a little holiday soon.

03:44.910 --> 03:46.820
Ask her about my brother's Mrs.

03:48.390 --> 03:50.589
Teeg, wait. Uncuff him.

03:50.590 --> 03:53.820
What? No way. He assaulted you.

03:55.990 --> 03:58.780
Now move your car
before I change my mind.

04:04.430 --> 04:06.629
If that'd been anyone else,
you would've charged 'em.

04:06.630 --> 04:08.429
It wasn't anyone else, was it?

04:08.430 --> 04:10.300
- It was your family.
- Yeah, so?

04:11.190 --> 04:12.629
Hang on, what has he said to you?

04:12.630 --> 04:14.869
I don't know, something
about his brother's wife.

04:14.870 --> 04:16.108
Oh, here we go.

04:16.110 --> 04:18.309
He tells everyone that she disappeared.

04:18.310 --> 04:20.269
She did. To Florida,
having the time of her life.

04:20.269 --> 04:21.509
I've seen it on Facebook.

04:21.510 --> 04:24.509
- OK.
- OK?

04:24.510 --> 04:25.869
That "OK" didn't sound OK.

04:25.870 --> 04:27.269
Stu, what's going on?

04:27.270 --> 04:29.149
I just think when, we're on duty,

04:29.150 --> 04:32.309
we should make it less obvious
we're, you know, a thing.

04:32.310 --> 04:34.189
Why should we?

04:34.190 --> 04:36.389
Oh, my God, I have
listened to crap like this

04:36.390 --> 04:39.109
for 25 years and ignored it

04:39.110 --> 04:40.949
and he says one little thing to you,

04:40.950 --> 04:43.189
and you're going on about
being less obvious?

04:43.190 --> 04:45.269
I tell you what, if you're
that worried about it,

04:45.270 --> 04:46.520
why don't we just finish?
Is that less obvious for you?

04:46.521 --> 04:47.488
No, I never said that.

04:47.513 --> 04:49.417
You didn't have to, cos
your face said it all.

04:49.418 --> 04:50.930
Teeg, wait, you've got this all wrong.

04:50.930 --> 04:52.780
Your dad's a better shag anyway.

05:02.180 --> 05:04.945
Dinah, Spike, we could do
with a bit of backup here.

05:04.946 --> 05:06.940
We're coming out.

05:09.480 --> 05:13.379
Get down! You're giving them
an excuse to arrest you!

05:13.404 --> 05:15.036
You're his blue-eyed boy.

05:15.037 --> 05:16.880
Try and rein him in before
he kicks off a riot.

05:16.905 --> 05:18.220
Yes, ma'am.

05:18.564 --> 05:19.963
Oh, God, look at her.

05:19.964 --> 05:21.924
Like butter wouldn't melt.

05:22.620 --> 05:24.500
Time she wasn't here.

05:31.364 --> 05:34.401
Sir, we need to get these inside
before it all really kicks off.

05:34.402 --> 05:35.803
It's easier said than done, Spike.

05:35.804 --> 05:39.220
It's like herding cats... with beards.

05:54.740 --> 05:56.140
Shit.

05:57.415 --> 06:00.057
Come on, love, that is enough.

06:02.004 --> 06:03.484
You were amazing!

06:04.380 --> 06:06.561
I could have done without
this was coming down.

06:06.562 --> 06:08.620
Half of them borderline feral.

06:09.620 --> 06:11.763
Have I done something
to upset your Sergeant?

06:11.764 --> 06:13.963
That's not the first
time she's looked at me

06:13.964 --> 06:17.044
- like I'm something she's trodden in.
- Trust me, that's her on a good day.

06:17.045 --> 06:19.100
She's normally Rose
McGowan meets Kill Bill.

06:19.564 --> 06:21.220
Off you go, love.

06:25.000 --> 06:26.719
Come on, Dinah.

06:26.720 --> 06:28.599
Less chewing of the wasps' nest.

06:28.600 --> 06:30.239
On second thoughts...

06:30.240 --> 06:31.959
It wasn't Big Box, ma'am.

06:31.960 --> 06:33.439
It was a scally kid.

06:33.440 --> 06:34.919
He's legged it.

06:34.920 --> 06:36.439
Said a fella gave him 20 quid

06:36.440 --> 06:38.039
if he'd wear the costume,

06:38.040 --> 06:39.759
and deliver a leaflet to the mayor.

06:39.760 --> 06:41.959
If he didn't, he'd slit his throat.

06:41.960 --> 06:43.599
Said the fella looked like a tramp.

06:43.600 --> 06:45.199
A ginger tramp.

06:45.200 --> 06:47.479
I just clocked Caroline's face
when she was at the car.

06:47.480 --> 06:49.919
Whatever was in that leaflet spooked her.

06:49.920 --> 06:51.341
A death threat from Beckett?

06:51.342 --> 06:52.478
Yeah, well, he might want her dead

06:52.479 --> 06:54.544
but he won't want her going
before he's got his hit money.

06:54.545 --> 06:55.700
Bonnie.

06:57.520 --> 06:59.334
From Beckett. To Dennis.

06:59.335 --> 07:00.719
"Make her pay."

07:00.720 --> 07:02.465
See, Beckett must have
come out of his bat cave

07:02.466 --> 07:04.965
to find that scally kid. He
could be nearby, we could get him.

07:04.966 --> 07:08.399
No, no. We can't let Beckett know
we know that he sent that to Dennis.

07:08.400 --> 07:09.960
And we certainly can't let him know.

07:10.660 --> 07:14.100
I've got a feeling that it's
just the mad bastard tuning up.

07:15.080 --> 07:19.080
Oh, look, even the opposition
are on my side, so thank you!

07:19.440 --> 07:20.879
See?

07:20.880 --> 07:22.359
She doesn't react.

07:22.360 --> 07:24.919
But when she was in the car,
she was definitely rattled.

07:24.920 --> 07:26.799
Give the psycho his Blue Peter badge,

07:26.800 --> 07:28.119
he's put some effort in there.

07:28.120 --> 07:29.719
Are we good?

07:29.720 --> 07:31.399
- Bonnie?
- Ma'am.

07:31.400 --> 07:32.919
Look sharp.

07:32.920 --> 07:35.860
Bonnie, I can't talk, you go ahead.

07:36.480 --> 07:39.239
I have just had the mayor on.

07:39.240 --> 07:41.719
Wants to know how that
Big Box got so near her.

07:41.720 --> 07:43.159
That could've been Beckett.

07:43.160 --> 07:44.973
Was there anything
on the leaflet, sir, or...?

07:44.974 --> 07:47.697
No, it was just a leftover
from his campaign.

07:47.698 --> 07:50.460
The point is, I have reassured her...

07:51.160 --> 07:55.160
I have reassured her worship
that we'll find Beckett.

07:55.440 --> 07:57.764
- Am I right?
- "Yes, sir."

07:57.789 --> 07:58.738
Yes, sir.

08:08.960 --> 08:10.919
Am I keeping you from
something, Sergeant?

08:10.920 --> 08:12.159
Sorry, that was my mum.

08:12.160 --> 08:13.799
My daughter's in a bad way.

08:13.800 --> 08:16.180
Taken one of them drugs
she deals in, has she?

08:17.040 --> 08:20.119
No, she's got a cyst the size of
an orange in her fallopian tubes

08:20.120 --> 08:21.599
if you must know, sir.

08:21.600 --> 08:22.919
She's in agony.

08:22.920 --> 08:25.479
Could end up infertile,
and she loves kids.

08:25.480 --> 08:27.719
Still, glass half full,

08:27.720 --> 08:30.420
at least she's definitely not a dealer.

08:31.320 --> 08:34.419
Right, well...

08:35.360 --> 08:38.999
So, let's get the
bastard and bring him in.

08:39.000 --> 08:41.399
Oh, DC Tanner? A word.

08:41.400 --> 08:43.119
- Yes, sir.
- As soon as you're ready.

08:43.120 --> 08:45.799
And tell them cleaners
to go easy on Febreze.

08:45.800 --> 08:48.860
My office smells like a tart's twat.

08:51.960 --> 08:53.479
We were right.

08:53.480 --> 08:55.239
Beckett just called Dennis.

08:55.240 --> 08:56.999
The leaflet was a warning to McCoy.

08:57.000 --> 08:59.599
He wants Dennis to bring him the 40 grand

08:59.600 --> 09:01.519
or someone'll end up in the obituaries.

09:01.520 --> 09:03.599
- But he didn't mention McCoy by name?
- No.

09:03.600 --> 09:06.279
Not one thing to link her
to Dirkin or the fake hit.

09:06.280 --> 09:08.479
So, all we've got are the
receipts that Proff found

09:08.480 --> 09:10.119
from payments made to her shop?

09:10.120 --> 09:12.039
That's not enough, it's nowhere near.

09:12.040 --> 09:14.599
At the risk of going all Lion
King on you, we keep the circle.

09:14.600 --> 09:17.280
Cos if Terry Dactyl gets a
whiff that we're on to McCoy,

09:17.620 --> 09:19.400
it's game over, we've lost.

09:19.820 --> 09:21.599
So, come on. Plan.

09:21.600 --> 09:23.679
We send Bonnie in to see McCoy,

09:23.680 --> 09:25.399
see if she'll pay the 40 grand,

09:25.400 --> 09:26.799
try and trip her up,

09:26.800 --> 09:29.639
get her to say anything that
links her to Dirkin or Beckett.

09:29.640 --> 09:31.239
Should Dennis go with her?

09:31.240 --> 09:33.959
She's a trained U/C.

09:33.960 --> 09:36.199
He's a gobby twat on two
legs who just pulls pints.

09:36.200 --> 09:39.079
He's Beckett's mate, it might be
more convincing if they both go in.

09:39.080 --> 09:42.420
OK, as long as Bonnie
does all the talking.

09:43.160 --> 09:46.340
We get Beckett, we get McCoy.

09:47.000 --> 09:49.020
And we get justice for Joy.

09:57.826 --> 09:59.540
KNOCK ON DOOR Come.

10:00.455 --> 10:01.540
Problem, sir?

10:10.135 --> 10:13.487
There's been a complaint of
misconduct made against you.

10:13.488 --> 10:16.020
- By who?
- Inspector Deering.

10:17.455 --> 10:18.380
For what?

10:18.975 --> 10:22.975
A few days ago, you told her
that you'd filed a report

10:23.015 --> 10:25.494
on an attempted robbery case in Denton.

10:25.495 --> 10:27.780
Except it wasn't filed till the next day.

10:28.375 --> 10:29.574
No, I remember.

10:29.575 --> 10:32.257
It was... Alice, me wife,

10:32.258 --> 10:34.654
she rang and said she was ill

10:34.655 --> 10:36.054
and couldn't look after the kids,

10:36.055 --> 10:37.274
so I finished my shift early.

10:37.275 --> 10:40.157
I mean, OK, the report was
filed late but I still put it in.

10:40.158 --> 10:43.469
DI Deering says she was checking
over all reports on all officers,

10:43.470 --> 10:45.334
that's when she came across it.

10:45.335 --> 10:47.820
The complaint is that it
wasn't done by the book.

10:48.335 --> 10:50.825
Well, Deering's hardly known
for doing things by the book.

10:50.826 --> 10:51.938
Exactly.

10:51.939 --> 10:54.420
There's something wrong with
this picture, isn't there?

10:55.315 --> 10:56.698
Sir...

10:56.725 --> 10:59.814
Inspector Deering's never made
a complaint against you before.

10:59.815 --> 11:00.871
Ever.

11:00.872 --> 11:03.351
The mayor appoints me as DCI

11:03.352 --> 11:05.271
and, within only a matter of days,

11:05.272 --> 11:07.471
Deering has made a complaint against you.

11:07.472 --> 11:09.991
I've let her know that you were
one of the finest cadets

11:09.992 --> 11:11.351
I'd ever trained

11:11.352 --> 11:13.471
and that I'd trust you with my life.

11:13.472 --> 11:16.471
She knows you and me go way back.

11:16.472 --> 11:19.351
Sorry, sir, I don't where
you're going with all this.

11:19.352 --> 11:22.911
Suppose Deering thinks
you are my eyes on her

11:22.912 --> 11:25.631
and that you report what
she's up to back to me.

11:25.632 --> 11:27.471
Every little detail.

11:27.472 --> 11:29.791
It'd be in her interests to have
you suspended

11:29.792 --> 11:32.220
while the case against
you was investigated.

11:33.072 --> 11:34.991
But I don't get it. What
would she be up to?

11:34.992 --> 11:37.138
Well, that's one of the reasons
the mayor brought me in,

11:37.139 --> 11:38.231
to find out.

11:38.232 --> 11:42.471
She doesn't trust Deering or that
DS Kol... Kow... Dinah

11:42.472 --> 11:45.031
since that business over her daughter.

11:45.032 --> 11:47.031
I've been watching them two.

11:47.032 --> 11:48.631
Thick as thieves.

11:48.632 --> 11:51.500
You ever wondered why she
was made Sergeant and not you?

11:52.318 --> 11:54.540
Can't say I wasn't gutted at the
time, but...

11:56.078 --> 11:57.398
...Dinah's a good cop.

11:57.423 --> 11:59.423
Better than you? I think not.

11:59.672 --> 12:01.591
Oh.

12:01.592 --> 12:03.020
Speak of the devil.

12:05.832 --> 12:07.100
Caroline.

12:10.752 --> 12:12.071
On my way.

12:12.072 --> 12:13.951
Don't worry, Spike.

12:13.952 --> 12:15.431
I've got your back.

12:15.432 --> 12:17.940
Unlike Deering, who's
just stuck a knife in it.

12:18.432 --> 12:20.071
Fetch your coat.

12:20.072 --> 12:24.031
Tell her you're following up a lead
on a case, make it convincing.

12:24.032 --> 12:25.791
- Where are we going?
- Town hall.

12:25.792 --> 12:28.831
Oh, and let Deering think
I'm looking further

12:28.832 --> 12:32.832
into her complaint against you which
you and I both know, I won't be.

12:33.712 --> 12:34.860
Yes, sir.

12:39.232 --> 12:40.300
Well?

12:41.192 --> 12:43.071
Fell for it hook, line and sinker.

12:43.072 --> 12:45.151
Or stinker in his case.

12:45.152 --> 12:47.351
Tell you what, ma'am, I
was bloody good in there, me.

12:47.352 --> 12:49.271
All right, Bafta Boy.

12:49.272 --> 12:50.871
You were right about McCoy.

12:50.872 --> 12:53.111
She's asked him to be her eyes
and ears on Friday Street.

12:53.112 --> 12:54.514
Especially you two. Thinks
you're up to something.

12:54.515 --> 12:57.791
- We are, taking that bitch down.
- I'm going to go and see her now.

12:57.792 --> 12:59.351
- What for?
- No idea.

12:59.352 --> 13:00.791
But as far as you two are concerned,

13:00.792 --> 13:02.720
I'm chasing up a lead on a case, right?

13:02.745 --> 13:03.712
You need to find out,

13:03.713 --> 13:06.111
is he her spy or just
her useful idiot, yeah?

13:06.112 --> 13:07.471
OK.

13:07.472 --> 13:11.311
Spike, make sure you're out of
there before we get Bonnie in.

13:11.312 --> 13:12.920
- Yeah.
- And you need to talk to him

13:12.945 --> 13:14.180
about the smell.

13:25.992 --> 13:28.003
You didn't tell me
you'd have company, Terry.

13:28.004 --> 13:30.700
Oh, don't worry, Deering
doesn't know he's here.

13:31.792 --> 13:33.220
Or does she?

13:34.432 --> 13:38.271
No! No, no. You told me to tell her
I was chasing up a lead, so I did.

13:38.272 --> 13:40.464
And how do we know that you won't
tell her you were here

13:40.465 --> 13:42.551
when you get back to the station?

13:42.552 --> 13:44.831
Well, you don't, I guess.

13:44.832 --> 13:48.832
But why would I tell her after she's
just filed a complaint against me?

13:49.872 --> 13:53.060
Sorry, sir, am I missing something here?

13:54.272 --> 13:57.860
The mayor wants to know why
you'd trust me more than Deering.

13:58.752 --> 14:01.087
Well, if it comes down to loyalty

14:01.088 --> 14:04.980
then let's just say I've known
the guv a lot longer than Deering.

14:05.678 --> 14:10.060
And I've had no reason not to be
loyal to her until today.

14:17.952 --> 14:19.660
Thanks, Nadine.

14:20.712 --> 14:23.751
So, you said you wanted
to discuss Beckett?

14:23.752 --> 14:24.940
I did.

14:25.392 --> 14:27.900
Ooh, you remembered, custard creams.

14:41.832 --> 14:44.631
Bonnie, hold on, we're
waiting on Spike and Taylor.

14:44.632 --> 14:46.272
They're still in with Caroline.

14:52.638 --> 14:55.758
I can't think straight knowing
that maniac's still out there.

14:55.783 --> 14:57.424
I mean, I know I look calm

14:57.449 --> 14:59.368
but I'm a bag of nerves.

14:59.432 --> 15:01.711
I'll put more officers around you.

15:01.712 --> 15:03.086
We'll get the bastard,

15:03.087 --> 15:04.574
- that's a promise.
- Thanks, Terry,

15:04.599 --> 15:06.631
I know it's not just words with you,

15:06.632 --> 15:08.631
you'll do whatever it takes.

15:08.632 --> 15:09.672
That's a given.

15:11.912 --> 15:13.151
Two minutes.

15:13.152 --> 15:16.592
Sorry, if you'll excuse me,
I've a meeting so...

15:17.140 --> 15:18.940
Thank you.

15:20.872 --> 15:22.991
Listen, think on, Terry,

15:22.992 --> 15:24.429
it'll be one in the eye for all of those

15:24.430 --> 15:26.175
that said I should have
left you to play golf,

15:26.176 --> 15:27.394
and you're not fit for purpose.

15:27.395 --> 15:30.500
If you get Beckett,
it'll be the making of you.

15:41.632 --> 15:43.591
They don't go in now, they'll miss her.

15:43.592 --> 15:45.552
She's in meetings all afternoon.

15:46.300 --> 15:47.620
Sod this.

15:49.032 --> 15:50.671
Sorry about that in there, Spike,

15:50.672 --> 15:52.831
but I just had to prove to the
mayor she can trust you.

15:52.832 --> 15:54.391
Ma'am?

15:54.392 --> 15:55.871
Spike, what the hell is going on?

15:55.872 --> 15:58.431
Yeah, no, I'm still chasing
up that lead in Denton.

15:58.432 --> 15:59.900
I'm just leaving now.

16:01.632 --> 16:03.271
Jesus.

16:03.272 --> 16:06.260
That coffee's gone through
me like a dose of salts.

16:08.592 --> 16:11.071
Correction. "Were" leaving.
Think he's gone to the toilet.

16:11.072 --> 16:12.711
What? Why didn't you stop him?

16:12.712 --> 16:14.911
I never had chance.
I think he's got the shits.

16:14.912 --> 16:18.391
Oh and, ma'am, he's just McCoy's
useful idiot, nothing more.

16:18.392 --> 16:20.287
I reckon if I wasn't there,
she'd have told him straight,

16:20.288 --> 16:22.340
"get Beckett before we do and kill him."

16:23.912 --> 16:25.820
Caroline's heading for the meeting room.

16:27.312 --> 16:30.180
We either do this now or
tell Bonnie to pull out.

16:32.192 --> 16:34.672
Trust Terry Dactyl's
bowels to cock this up.

16:34.673 --> 16:37.645
- Do it.
- Bonnie, go in. McCoy's left her office.

16:37.646 --> 16:38.679
She's headed towards you.

16:38.680 --> 16:40.958
Spike, make sure Taylor doesn't come
out of the bogs

16:40.959 --> 16:42.897
or he's going to see
Bonnie and Dennis coming in.

16:42.898 --> 16:44.100
Received.

16:45.952 --> 16:47.751
Sir? You OK?

16:47.752 --> 16:51.752
Oh! Christ it's like a bastard
tap's been turned on.

16:51.872 --> 16:54.071
Ooh! That's all right.
Just take your time.

16:54.072 --> 16:56.540
- Take as much time as you need.
- Oh!

17:00.232 --> 17:03.460
Bonnie, Caroline's
approaching from the right.

17:05.271 --> 17:07.980
I'm about two stone lighter.

17:08.752 --> 17:10.711
Sir, don't you want
to use the hand-dryer?

17:10.712 --> 17:12.099
What for?

17:12.752 --> 17:14.351
Sorry, sir, listen,

17:14.352 --> 17:17.391
I just meant to say, you are
exactly what Friday Street needs.

17:17.392 --> 17:19.590
I've been surrounded
by so much oestrogen,

17:19.592 --> 17:21.790
I think my balls have shrivelled up.

17:21.791 --> 17:23.900
The boys are back in town.

17:37.512 --> 17:38.769
Pull her in to the lift.

17:38.770 --> 17:40.023
Now!

17:43.551 --> 17:45.060
It's all right. Let's go.

17:51.152 --> 17:53.111
No, I don't think so, love.

17:53.112 --> 17:55.631
We're here to make sure you give
Beckett the money you owe him.

17:55.632 --> 17:57.871
- What money?
- The money for the fake hit you arranged.

17:57.872 --> 17:59.711
You don't get it by midday tomorrow,

17:59.712 --> 18:01.111
he won't miss second time around.

18:01.112 --> 18:02.546
You do get it, you
won't hear from him again.

18:02.547 --> 18:04.536
You've not got long. Cut to the wind up.

18:04.537 --> 18:05.663
I don't know what you're talking about.

18:05.664 --> 18:07.410
Come on, that kind of
money's peanuts to you.

18:07.411 --> 18:09.871
All this "I'm still
Jenny from the block" shit.

18:09.872 --> 18:11.424
You're just a big phoney.

18:11.425 --> 18:12.881
I bet you've got shoes
worth more than that.

18:12.882 --> 18:14.854
I'm from Cinderly, mate, not Wilmslow.

18:14.855 --> 18:19.231
I begrudge paying 40 quid for a
pair of shoes let alone 40 grand.

18:19.232 --> 18:20.820
Bingo.

18:27.992 --> 18:31.271
I'm calling security,
I'm going to get you two arrested.

18:31.272 --> 18:32.831
I don't think so.

18:32.832 --> 18:34.911
- What the hell are you playing at?
- Oh, fucking hell.

18:34.912 --> 18:38.100
You get that money for my
mate Joe or I'll finish you.

18:39.872 --> 18:41.700
There was a deal!

18:42.592 --> 18:45.071
There was a deal, right?

18:45.072 --> 18:46.551
Lift's about to stop.

18:46.552 --> 18:50.552
Bonnie, get out of there, he blew
it soon as he got the gun out.

18:57.992 --> 19:00.036
Go on, you call security, call the cops,

19:00.037 --> 19:01.603
call whoever you like,

19:01.604 --> 19:03.791
they're going to have a lot of questions

19:03.792 --> 19:05.820
and we can give them a lot of answers.

19:08.032 --> 19:09.391
Bonnie had him.

19:09.392 --> 19:11.551
Dennis the fucking Menace.

19:11.552 --> 19:13.820
He just screwed the whole thing up.

19:16.312 --> 19:17.950
Argh! Give me one good
reason why I shouldn't

19:17.951 --> 19:19.544
take a Taser to your testes right now.

19:19.545 --> 19:21.841
All right, calm your tits,
it weren't even loaded.

19:21.842 --> 19:23.551
You never said a thing about a gun.

19:23.552 --> 19:25.591
I just thought my way of
getting that bitch to talk

19:25.592 --> 19:26.871
was better than your way.

19:26.872 --> 19:28.271
You've just given McCoy an excuse

19:28.272 --> 19:30.151
to put a bigger ring fence
of Fuzz around her.

19:30.152 --> 19:32.160
All right, no need to go all
Witches of Eastwick on me.

19:32.161 --> 19:33.220
Caddy!

19:33.632 --> 19:35.511
You need to start singing our song

19:35.512 --> 19:37.711
otherwise my girl's
death goes for nothing

19:37.712 --> 19:39.980
and that's not going to
happen on my watch.

19:43.272 --> 19:44.991
We need to fall back on Plan B.

19:44.992 --> 19:47.100
- What's Plan B?
- Haven't a clue.

19:48.592 --> 19:49.820
Unless...

19:50.891 --> 19:52.260
Marilyn.

19:55.872 --> 19:59.500
Ma'am, we're going to need
bait to bring Beckett in.

20:06.944 --> 20:09.263
Gentlemen, any joy on that witness?

20:09.264 --> 20:11.143
Turned out to be an ex with a grudge.

20:11.144 --> 20:12.903
Two hours I spent twatting about on that.

20:12.904 --> 20:15.900
By the way, the Mayor's asked me to
put more officers around her.

20:16.784 --> 20:18.223
Keep on it, everyone!

20:18.224 --> 20:20.021
Beckett's out there somewhere.

20:20.022 --> 20:22.900
I'll make sure I write the
report up now, sir.

20:23.944 --> 20:25.900
Smile wouldn't hurt would it, Tiggy?

20:27.904 --> 20:32.780
Better? And just for the record,
sir, my name is Tegan.

20:35.104 --> 20:38.383
You got everybody else's name right
in here except for mine.

20:38.384 --> 20:40.223
I wonder why that is, eh?

20:40.224 --> 20:45.020
You do not speak to a senior
officer like that. Ever!

20:46.744 --> 20:50.744
Constable Thompson? My office. Now.

20:52.784 --> 20:56.263
Look, I know what she was implying
there and I'm not having it.

20:56.264 --> 21:01.140
Besides, how can I be racist when my
Go-To wet dream is Oti off Strictly?

21:02.744 --> 21:04.740
You've got me there, sir.

21:09.624 --> 21:13.223
Spike, have you spoken to him
about the whiff?

21:13.224 --> 21:14.823
No, not yet.

21:14.824 --> 21:17.143
Do it before it goes nuclear.

21:17.144 --> 21:18.420
All right.

21:23.144 --> 21:26.063
Now, I know that I'm supposed to
pretend that I DON'T know all

21:26.064 --> 21:28.080
the ins and outs of everybody's
private lives out there,

21:28.105 --> 21:29.823
but you know the rules,

21:29.824 --> 21:32.943
fine for two officers to
have a bit of love action,

21:32.944 --> 21:36.944
not fine when it affects how they do
the job or how they speak to a DCI.

21:37.664 --> 21:38.783
We all know he's racist.

21:38.784 --> 21:40.023
Yeah, except for him.

21:40.024 --> 21:42.183
I know, and I promise it will
be dealt with.

21:42.184 --> 21:44.174
But the fact is we're stuck with him

21:44.199 --> 21:46.208
until Marilyn comes back
from her suspension.

21:46.544 --> 21:48.860
So don't let the fossil fart wind you up.

21:50.584 --> 21:51.823
Yeah, well, just so you know,

21:51.824 --> 21:53.743
me and Stu aren't together any more
anyway.

21:53.744 --> 21:57.263
You're just over-reacting to that
stuff with your cousin, that's all.

21:57.264 --> 21:58.983
How do you know?

21:58.984 --> 22:02.180
Told you, all the ins and outs.

22:04.424 --> 22:07.263
Nobody said that the road to happiness

22:07.264 --> 22:09.223
was going to be a smooth one.

22:09.224 --> 22:13.559
But trust me, this is just a little
pot-hole, it's not a sink hole.

22:13.584 --> 22:15.503
You'll be back together before long.

22:15.504 --> 22:20.157
And if you're not, well, bit like
what me Scottish gran used to say

22:20.182 --> 22:23.180
"What's for you'll nae get past you".

22:23.864 --> 22:25.743
What does that even mean?

22:25.744 --> 22:28.423
God knows, she was in a home by then.

22:28.424 --> 22:30.663
Could see Colonel Gaddafi
behind the curtains.

22:30.664 --> 22:31.983
Come on.

22:31.984 --> 22:33.876
You get back out there and be

22:33.877 --> 22:36.620
the lippy, brilliant cop that we all
know you are.

22:39.584 --> 22:41.300
Oh, and before you do...

22:54.944 --> 22:57.023
Erm, I can come back if it's not...

22:57.024 --> 22:59.143
No, no, no, you're all right.

22:59.144 --> 23:00.660
What can I do you for?

23:01.664 --> 23:03.380
Erm, I, er...

23:04.784 --> 23:08.100
I just wanted to say, about before...

23:10.744 --> 23:12.504
It won't happen again.

23:12.860 --> 23:14.740
You're right. It won't.

23:15.864 --> 23:17.820
But apology accepted.

23:20.624 --> 23:23.820
Hey. Don't let it upset you, Tegan.

23:31.824 --> 23:33.023
What did Marilyn say?

23:33.024 --> 23:34.563
A lot of things, ending in "off"

23:34.564 --> 23:37.183
but she has agreed
to work on Pembroke tonight.

23:37.184 --> 23:38.903
What if she can't persuade him?

23:38.904 --> 23:41.703
No bait, no Beckett.
No job to come to in the morning.

23:41.704 --> 23:43.223
It has to be WHEN she persuades him.

23:43.224 --> 23:44.503
Not if.

23:44.504 --> 23:46.440
OK, so when you've heard from Marilyn

23:46.465 --> 23:48.339
that she's got the
money, I'll tell Bonnie.

23:48.340 --> 23:50.543
Beckett said he'd call Dennis
tomorrow to make sure he'd got it.

23:50.544 --> 23:54.223
But he didn't say when he'd call
or where Dennis should meet him.

23:54.224 --> 23:57.423
I thought that you had promised
Tessa a pizza and box set tonight?

23:57.424 --> 23:59.943
Yeah, I did, but I
think I should be here.

23:59.944 --> 24:01.383
She'll say you should be there.

24:01.384 --> 24:03.103
- Yeah, but...
- Go on.

24:03.104 --> 24:06.383
That cyst of hers must be the size
of a grapefruit by now.

24:06.384 --> 24:07.744
More like a melon.

24:08.600 --> 24:09.900
Get gone.

24:18.424 --> 24:22.424
Christ, Vivienne, I've pulled more
strings than Harpo Marx for you.

24:23.784 --> 24:25.740
Pembroke came through.

24:26.624 --> 24:28.960
Two weeks in Malibu, spunk
the rest off in Vegas,

24:28.985 --> 24:30.770
who'd know? Hit the gas, Thelma.

24:30.795 --> 24:32.911
That is "confiscated" money, remember?

24:32.912 --> 24:35.510
Borrowed bait, for 24 hours only.

24:35.511 --> 24:37.040
If you don't get Beckett in that time,

24:37.065 --> 24:39.583
that's going straight back to HQ's vault.

24:39.584 --> 24:42.583
Right, I've booked a Brazilian for 11.

24:42.584 --> 24:44.497
Thought I'd see what all the
fuss was all about.

24:44.522 --> 24:47.055
Enjoy the rest of your
lady garden leave, then.

24:47.104 --> 24:48.500
Vivienne?

24:49.344 --> 24:51.420
This cannot go wrong.

24:55.984 --> 24:58.943
- Come!
- Can I just have a minute, sir?

24:58.944 --> 25:00.260
Yeah.

25:05.464 --> 25:08.983
Deering doesn't suspect, does she?
Eyes like a bastard chameleon.

25:08.984 --> 25:09.984
Oh, no, no, not a clue.

25:09.985 --> 25:11.623
No, I know how to play her.

25:11.624 --> 25:12.780
Good man.

25:18.464 --> 25:19.703
Are you OK?

25:19.704 --> 25:21.783
Yes, sweating cobs.

25:21.784 --> 25:23.423
Think I might have a shower.

25:23.424 --> 25:25.543
Have you seen the showers, here?

25:25.544 --> 25:27.583
They're like a power shower, good.

25:27.584 --> 25:30.703
I can show you if... if
you're going that way.

25:30.704 --> 25:34.183
Oh, Christ. This isn't what
I think it is, is it?

25:34.184 --> 25:37.499
I'm sorry. I didn't want to bring it up.

25:37.500 --> 25:40.060
I know you're a senior officer.

25:40.944 --> 25:42.863
I'm just trying to say it as it is, mate.

25:42.864 --> 25:45.663
No, not you, Spike. No way.

25:45.664 --> 25:46.703
Not me what?

25:46.704 --> 25:49.063
I never had you down as a knob jockey.

25:49.064 --> 25:51.943
What?! Jesus, no! That's not
what I'm talking about!

25:51.944 --> 25:54.583
What are you going on about
showers and shit for?

25:54.584 --> 25:56.023
Because it's...

25:56.024 --> 25:57.500
It's...

26:01.624 --> 26:03.020
You can have that.

26:04.424 --> 26:07.303
I've got three of them at home,
gift sets from Christmas.

26:07.304 --> 26:08.863
Are you saying I smell?

26:08.864 --> 26:10.663
It's, no, it's the air-con.

26:10.664 --> 26:13.940
See, the air-con is on the blink and
it can get really stuffy.

26:14.584 --> 26:16.500
You can use that.

26:30.824 --> 26:32.180
Is that all?

26:33.184 --> 26:34.620
Yeah.

26:41.464 --> 26:43.540
Oh! Bonnie.

26:44.064 --> 26:46.380
'Cinderly arches, 15 minutes.'

26:47.104 --> 26:48.943
Ma'am.

26:48.944 --> 26:49.983
We need to go.

26:49.984 --> 26:51.063
Now.

26:51.064 --> 26:53.623
Aren't you meant to be at the
Mayor's swanky do at the Town Hall?

26:53.624 --> 26:55.383
Yeah, that's what I've come to tell you.

26:55.384 --> 26:58.423
I think I'm going to stick around in
case Beckett comes out of hiding.

26:58.424 --> 26:59.703
What if he doesn't?

26:59.704 --> 27:01.169
You'll have missed your guest of
honour spot

27:01.170 --> 27:03.943
and jam roly poly for pud, I'm told.

27:03.944 --> 27:06.543
You can take PC Mitchell with you.
We'll keep you posted.

27:06.544 --> 27:09.140
You don't want to let the
Mayor down, now, do you?

27:11.664 --> 27:13.743
You get anything, I want to hear.

27:13.744 --> 27:15.820
Oh, that goes without saying, sir.

27:22.264 --> 27:25.463
Wait until I give you the nod before
you tell him about Beckett.

27:25.464 --> 27:26.700
Ma'am.

27:27.344 --> 27:29.823
Think it was the jam
roly-poly that swung it.

27:29.824 --> 27:33.063
Is it my imagination or has the
whiff-o-meter dialled down a notch?

27:33.064 --> 27:34.623
Deffo.

27:34.624 --> 27:36.703
Blue-eyed boy's still got it.

27:36.704 --> 27:38.340
Right, shift.

27:52.984 --> 27:54.900
Over five minutes late.

27:55.944 --> 27:57.303
This could be a test.

27:57.304 --> 27:59.740
See if Dennis has been tailed.

28:02.664 --> 28:04.020
Look.

28:09.144 --> 28:10.980
It's him, Dennis.

28:12.304 --> 28:14.620
'Stick to the plan, OK?'

28:15.864 --> 28:18.460
Do exactly as I say. No pissing about.

28:23.624 --> 28:25.940
Millets have gone down the nick,
haven't they?

28:26.664 --> 28:28.703
'Now try to get him to
admit to the fake hit.

28:28.704 --> 28:30.623
'We need him to say Caroline's name.'

28:30.624 --> 28:31.900
Look.

28:32.704 --> 28:34.540
It's all there, Joe,

28:35.104 --> 28:37.703
what McCoy owes you for the fake hit.

28:37.704 --> 28:41.704
Bet you wish you'd shot the bitch
dead, saved all this pissing about.

28:51.264 --> 28:53.743
He's holding something in his hand, what?

28:53.744 --> 28:55.460
What's in his hand, Den?

28:55.984 --> 28:58.103
What's this? Phone a friend?

28:58.104 --> 28:59.743
Back up.

28:59.744 --> 29:01.143
Mobile phone.

29:01.144 --> 29:02.620
'What for?'

29:03.144 --> 29:04.703
'You might have been tailed.'

29:04.704 --> 29:06.980
Well, I wasn't. I'd know.

29:07.784 --> 29:09.703
Yeah, well, just in case.

29:09.704 --> 29:12.620
A little farewell from our
old mate, Randy.

29:14.144 --> 29:16.543
You wired a device to him?

29:16.544 --> 29:18.220
It's a bomb.

29:19.704 --> 29:22.703
I take my finger off this button, boom.

29:22.704 --> 29:24.820
Where is this Randy, Den?

29:26.584 --> 29:28.703
Usual target?

29:28.704 --> 29:30.700
Yeah, of course.

29:33.504 --> 29:35.943
'Miller, find out who's Randy.'

29:35.944 --> 29:38.783
Beckett just said something about
"my old mate", could be Army?

29:38.784 --> 29:40.463
Fucking Randy?

29:40.464 --> 29:42.240
How the hell's Beckett persuaded someone

29:42.265 --> 29:43.663
to have a load of explosives
strapped to them?

29:43.664 --> 29:45.103
"Usual target"?

29:45.104 --> 29:46.223
Asian kids.

29:46.224 --> 29:47.423
Could be another school?

29:47.424 --> 29:48.503
Or a mosque?

29:48.504 --> 29:50.103
Mosque is more likely.

29:50.104 --> 29:51.576
60-odd mosques in Manchester,

29:51.601 --> 29:53.023
five or six in town and
at least 20 in the south.

29:53.024 --> 29:54.703
The one near the abattoir he worked in.

29:54.704 --> 29:56.312
Could be miles from where
he's been hiding out,

29:56.337 --> 29:57.484
couldn't it? Could be anywhere.

29:57.485 --> 29:58.981
He knows this side of Manchester, though.

29:58.982 --> 30:02.663
He's more likely to have targeted
somewhere round here, isn't he?

30:02.664 --> 30:04.837
Yeah, I'm going to go with Dinah's
joined-up thinking.

30:04.838 --> 30:06.920
So if Randy is within a two-mile radius,

30:06.945 --> 30:08.863
we need to search those mosques first.

30:08.864 --> 30:10.002
Miller? Good.

30:10.003 --> 30:12.343
You've not ordered mobile phone
masts nearby to be switched off?

30:12.344 --> 30:13.543
Was just about to. Why?

30:13.544 --> 30:15.360
We don't know how he's
rigged the device yet.

30:15.385 --> 30:17.168
A switch-off might detonate it.

30:17.208 --> 30:19.263
Might not, but you can't risk it.

30:19.264 --> 30:21.423
Control, calling all officers.

30:21.424 --> 30:24.263
Check all mosques in South Manchester.

30:24.264 --> 30:28.264
We're looking for a bloke carrying
a rucksack, carrier bag, anything.

30:28.504 --> 30:31.223
'Beckett's planted a bomb on him.
Goes by the name of Randy.'

30:40.780 --> 30:42.459
If Dennis hasn't the smarts for this,

30:42.460 --> 30:44.500
then a whole load of people
are going to be blown to bits.

30:45.582 --> 30:47.181
You need to keep him talking, Den.

30:47.182 --> 30:49.420
Why don't you just piss off out of here?

30:50.302 --> 30:52.781
Take the money and the shooter and go?

30:52.782 --> 30:55.980
I'll give you the bag,
and you deactivate the bomb, yeah?

30:58.742 --> 31:01.940
Since when have you been arsed
about a load of ragheads dying?

31:04.302 --> 31:07.300
What's blowing up a load of Muslims
going to prove, though?

31:08.742 --> 31:10.101
I'm not risking it.

31:10.102 --> 31:13.141
Viv, you can't show your face.
The whole op will fail.

31:13.142 --> 31:15.501
That was before we knew that Beckett
had strapped a bomb to

31:15.502 --> 31:17.061
somebody who's out there right now.

31:20.062 --> 31:22.181
- Miller?
- It's not a bloke we're looking for.

31:22.182 --> 31:24.061
He's gone and nicked a frigging goat!

31:24.062 --> 31:28.317
Randy, or Lance Corporal Randolph,
to give him his full title.

31:28.342 --> 31:30.581
Never had a goat named
after me before, a rabbit, yes.

31:30.582 --> 31:34.582
I digress. Look, it's the goat
from his old regiment.

31:35.382 --> 31:38.101
A goat? A goat!

31:38.102 --> 31:40.300
Jesus Christ.

31:40.822 --> 31:43.581
Take the reins. Now, as soon as we
find that goat, call bomb squad in.

31:43.582 --> 31:44.701
What about Terry Dactyl?

31:44.702 --> 31:47.701
Well, you'll have to stall him
for as long as you can.

31:47.702 --> 31:49.820
No, Viv. Viv, wait!

31:50.902 --> 31:54.061
Just in case, you'll make a cracking DI.

31:54.062 --> 31:56.340
Not as good as me, obviously.

31:58.382 --> 32:00.580
A goat? Is this a wind-up?

32:01.262 --> 32:03.221
Course I'm going to make a go of it
with her, yeah.

32:03.222 --> 32:04.660
She's pregnant.

32:08.502 --> 32:09.820
No.

32:12.422 --> 32:13.901
No. No!

32:15.182 --> 32:17.781
I hope they've offered you more than
30 pieces of silver.

32:17.782 --> 32:19.381
I'm sorry, mate. I had no choice.

32:19.382 --> 32:21.741
You did, but you chose them over me!

32:21.742 --> 32:24.421
No, I chose Bonnie and the baby.

32:24.422 --> 32:28.061
OK, I know that despite the fact
you're surrounded by armed officers,

32:28.062 --> 32:29.581
it's you that's in control here.

32:29.582 --> 32:30.981
What do you want, Joe?

32:30.982 --> 32:33.501
I want you to stop the lame
attempt at trying to become my mate,

32:33.502 --> 32:35.901
for a kick-off, and cut the "Joe" shit!

32:35.902 --> 32:38.261
Fair do's. "Bastard" it is, then.

32:38.262 --> 32:42.262
I only ask cos I assume that,
with or without your back-up plan,

32:42.287 --> 32:44.727
you want to walk out of here
in one piece,

32:44.752 --> 32:47.460
with 40K and your gun,
and just disappear?

32:49.062 --> 32:50.940
How could you be turned by her, eh?

32:51.702 --> 32:54.061
A little squashed Madonna.

32:54.062 --> 32:56.461
I don't give a shiny shit what you
call me but you need to know

32:56.462 --> 32:59.701
that if you pick up that bag and you
walk off, you will be followed.

32:59.702 --> 33:01.541
Now, you can't run away forever.

33:01.542 --> 33:04.701
You can't run away from this,
all that hate.

33:04.702 --> 33:08.061
The PTSD that they never
properly treated you for,

33:08.062 --> 33:09.740
it'll still be there.

33:11.142 --> 33:13.141
Now, if you take your
finger off that button

33:13.142 --> 33:14.901
and you blow up a load of
innocent people,

33:14.902 --> 33:16.820
we've got nothing left
on the table to discuss.

33:17.422 --> 33:20.541
And if I don't blow them up, you're
just going to let me go, are you?

33:20.542 --> 33:21.901
No, of course not.

33:21.902 --> 33:25.061
You killed a brilliant officer
of mine, a good friend.

33:25.062 --> 33:26.420
No, you'll serve a sentence,

33:27.102 --> 33:30.981
but for how long depends on you
not detonating that bomb.

33:30.982 --> 33:33.040
Negative at Flat Field. On
our way to Cinderly Mosque.

33:33.065 --> 33:34.221
Received.

33:34.222 --> 33:36.421
I'm not serving time for you lot, yeah?

33:36.422 --> 33:37.541
Not no-one!

33:37.542 --> 33:39.060
Not one day!

33:39.902 --> 33:41.261
Give me the gun, Dennis.

33:41.262 --> 33:43.661
- What you going to do, Joe?
- I'm going to shoot some pigeons.

33:43.662 --> 33:45.421
What the fuck do you think
I'm going to do?!

33:45.422 --> 33:47.980
If I'm going out,
I'm going out on my terms!

33:49.142 --> 33:51.741
If you give me the gun,
I won't set the bomb off.

33:51.742 --> 33:55.101
I'll hand the phone over here to
Inspector Fat Madge.

33:55.102 --> 33:57.501
I'm not going to stand here
and watch you kill yourself.

33:57.502 --> 33:58.620
No way.

33:59.422 --> 34:00.620
Kabul,

34:01.182 --> 34:02.701
Sangin,

34:02.702 --> 34:03.901
Kandahar,

34:03.902 --> 34:05.501
and this one,

34:05.502 --> 34:09.502
this one you know,
because this one I took for you.

34:11.902 --> 34:14.061
Come on, just give me the gun, Den.

34:14.062 --> 34:16.301
You owe me at least! Give me the gun!

34:16.302 --> 34:18.061
Dennis, come on.

34:18.062 --> 34:19.141
Give me the gun!

34:21.262 --> 34:22.460
Don't do it, Dennis.

34:22.462 --> 34:24.981
How do I know that you're not going
to shoot one of my officers?

34:24.982 --> 34:26.179
You don't.

34:26.902 --> 34:28.179
It's your call,

34:28.902 --> 34:30.980
the gun or the bomb?

34:31.822 --> 34:33.380
He had put a goat at Cinderly mosque.

34:33.382 --> 34:35.261
A couple of girls untied it.

34:35.262 --> 34:36.301
Where is it, then?

34:36.302 --> 34:38.420
I'm not sure, fella said he saw
them heading towards

34:38.422 --> 34:40.261
Cinderly Market,
so we're on our way there.

34:40.262 --> 34:42.741
If you find it, you wait till
bomb squad are there.

34:44.422 --> 34:47.940
OK, before Dennis gives you the
gun for you to blow your brains out,

34:47.942 --> 34:52.516
make your last words an admission
that Caroline McCoy arranged

34:52.542 --> 34:55.341
a fake assassination,
and that you were the gunman.

34:55.342 --> 34:56.900
You just need to say that it's true,

34:56.902 --> 34:58.581
and then Dennis will hand you the gun,

34:58.582 --> 35:02.582
you stop that bomb and you can
leave this world on your own terms.

35:03.262 --> 35:07.262
Two words, "It's true."

35:08.302 --> 35:09.941
Two words, get fucked.

35:09.942 --> 35:11.701
They're your terms, not mine.

35:11.702 --> 35:14.100
Dennis! Give me the gun!

35:17.782 --> 35:18.861
Come on, Dennis.

35:18.862 --> 35:21.101
Do you think that McCoy
didn't know that Dirkin had

35:21.102 --> 35:23.020
paid Dennis to shoot you?

35:23.902 --> 35:25.941
No, neither do I.

35:25.942 --> 35:28.341
And if you don't say those words,
then she's going to come up

35:28.342 --> 35:32.342
smelling of roses and you are going
to end up reeking of failure.

35:34.222 --> 35:35.940
Is that what you want?

35:39.702 --> 35:40.980
Stick together.

35:43.782 --> 35:45.020
There it is.

35:47.942 --> 35:50.221
All right, girls?
Where did you get that goat?

35:50.222 --> 35:51.661
Erm, the goat shop.

35:51.662 --> 35:54.461
Thing is, we're going to need to
borrow this goat, just for a minute.

35:54.462 --> 35:56.421
No. We found it. It's ours.

35:56.422 --> 35:58.781
Right, you know that psycho
who poisoned the Halal meat?

35:58.782 --> 36:01.141
Well, he's wired that goat with
a load of explosives,

36:01.142 --> 36:05.142
so if you don't hand it over, we're
all going to be in bits, literally.

36:06.422 --> 36:08.941
Run! Bomb on that goat! Bomb!

36:12.862 --> 36:15.901
We've found the goat at
Cinderly Market. It's on the run.

36:15.902 --> 36:17.941
Right, wait till bomb squad are there.

36:17.942 --> 36:19.581
We can't. It's in with a load of people.

36:19.582 --> 36:21.340
We've got to get it out of here.

36:23.622 --> 36:26.021
All officers to Cinderly Market.

36:26.022 --> 36:28.740
Miller, get down there,
they need all the help they can get.

36:29.662 --> 36:31.381
Jonah, we've found the bomb.

36:31.382 --> 36:34.141
It's strapped to a goat running
around Cinderly Market.

36:34.142 --> 36:36.180
Tegan and Stuart are trying to catch it.

36:37.662 --> 36:39.661
You'll have to give Terry Dactyl
the heads-up,

36:39.662 --> 36:41.461
Bomb Squad are on their way.

36:41.462 --> 36:42.740
Copy that.

36:43.502 --> 36:46.061
Give the goat apples, one at a time.

36:46.062 --> 36:49.421
Lead it away from the marketplace
to somewhere safe.

36:49.422 --> 36:53.740
What Cinderly has needed for ages
is a proper Chief Inspector,

36:54.102 --> 36:57.581
but unfortunately I couldn't find one.

36:57.582 --> 36:58.661
I'm joking!

36:58.662 --> 37:02.662
Ladies and gentlemen, DCI Terry Taylor.

37:03.902 --> 37:07.621
Sir, Beckett's been found
at Cinderly Arches.

37:07.622 --> 37:09.301
Terry, what's going on?

37:09.302 --> 37:11.901
They've found Beckett at Cinderly
Arches. I need to be there.

37:11.902 --> 37:14.341
All right, well, remember,
this is your chance to shine.

37:14.342 --> 37:18.342
Whatever you do, I'll back you to
the hilt, but do it.

37:19.422 --> 37:22.581
Erm, excuse me everybody, duty calls!

37:22.582 --> 37:26.582
Raise your glasses for DCI Terry Taylor!

37:30.382 --> 37:34.061
Bonnie, you need to go,
Taylor can't find you here with us.

37:34.062 --> 37:38.061
Dennis, just give me the gun! Dennis!

37:38.062 --> 37:40.620
Dennis, look at me. Look at me, Dennis!

37:45.862 --> 37:47.421
Come on.

37:47.422 --> 37:50.221
That's it, come on.

37:50.222 --> 37:51.501
Come on, Rudolph.

37:51.502 --> 37:52.901
It's Randolph.

37:52.902 --> 37:56.261
Right, gents, can you do yourselves
a favour and get gone?

37:56.262 --> 37:58.741
Move, guys, I need you to go down
that way, please.

37:58.742 --> 38:01.341
You too, madam. Be safe, not cheeky!

38:01.342 --> 38:02.821
Guys, there's a bomb on the goat.

38:02.822 --> 38:04.781
Just move that way, please.
Clear the area.

38:04.782 --> 38:07.021
Here. Apples, not oranges!

38:07.022 --> 38:10.901
Oh! No time to be picky about your
food, Randy, Christ! Wait there.

38:10.902 --> 38:12.381
The gun!

38:12.382 --> 38:14.860
Dennis, Dennis!

38:16.142 --> 38:17.900
Think of your kid.

38:20.702 --> 38:22.341
Dennis!

38:22.342 --> 38:25.180
It's an order.

38:28.502 --> 38:32.502
DCI Taylor is on the scene.
He's now in command.

38:36.622 --> 38:38.340
We're going to run out of apples.

38:38.982 --> 38:41.301
Stu, what I said about your dad before...

38:41.302 --> 38:43.501
..I didn't mean it.

38:52.182 --> 38:55.501
Denise, I won't tell
you again. Get a move on!

38:55.502 --> 38:58.261
Shit. You there, I need you to move
right back for me, please.

38:58.262 --> 39:02.262
Get out the way! Get back!
Everyone, clear the area!

39:06.222 --> 39:08.621
Give me the gun! Give me the...!

39:08.622 --> 39:09.741
GUNSHOT Say it.

39:09.742 --> 39:10.781
Shoot the subject.

39:18.582 --> 39:21.700
Stuart? Tegan? Come in.

39:49.222 --> 39:51.420
Stuart!

39:53.062 --> 39:54.500
Ma'am...

39:57.782 --> 40:01.782
Ma'am, I'm here, but Stu...

40:02.702 --> 40:04.580
Viv, give us a minute.

40:15.782 --> 40:17.421
Let's get the medics in, now!

40:17.422 --> 40:19.861
No, no, no, sweetheart. Not you.

40:19.862 --> 40:21.340
Not you.

40:33.622 --> 40:35.461
HE EXHALES How did you...?

40:35.462 --> 40:37.620
I legged it around the other side.

40:42.102 --> 40:46.102
Ma'am, our brave boy is
still in one piece.

40:50.702 --> 40:54.702
The other good news,
there's no serious casualties.

40:55.462 --> 40:57.341
The bad news is
Lance Corporal Randolph is

40:57.342 --> 40:59.941
spread over four postcodes.

40:59.942 --> 41:02.901
Right, get a room or a wiggle on,
Beckett's been shot.

41:02.902 --> 41:05.300
Ah! I've got goat on me.

41:06.262 --> 41:08.141
No, I tell a lie, it's pasty.

41:13.502 --> 41:16.781
He nearly said it, we could have had her.

41:24.422 --> 41:25.780
Dinah, what you doing?

41:26.622 --> 41:28.380
He killed Joy.

41:29.782 --> 41:31.581
Dinah, we need him alive, right?

41:31.582 --> 41:33.781
Now. Come on.

41:33.782 --> 41:35.980
OK... One, two, come on!

41:44.702 --> 41:46.341
I thought he'd shot you.

41:46.342 --> 41:47.621
I had to give the order.

41:47.622 --> 41:51.622
I know. Aside from one dead goat,
no casualties from the bomb.

41:54.022 --> 41:56.061
I had no choice.

41:56.062 --> 41:57.381
Is he dead?

41:57.382 --> 41:59.141
I don't know.

41:59.142 --> 42:01.021
What was he saying? What did he want?

42:01.022 --> 42:03.101
He was just banging on
about betrayal, loyalty,

42:03.102 --> 42:07.102
being used by people he thought he
could trust, that sort of thing.

42:11.822 --> 42:15.822
I'm a woman of my word, Terry,
I'll back you all the way.

42:32.308 --> 42:34.468
My mate Spike just entered the room.

42:34.493 --> 42:35.780
You two met.

42:37.241 --> 42:41.241
He was the one who was nearly
not with us today, but he is...

42:43.942 --> 42:45.580
...and he forgives you.

42:47.622 --> 42:49.860
Like all Joy's friends, he must.

42:51.662 --> 42:54.740
Because the day you pulled a gun on
Caroline McCoy, Joseph,

42:56.022 --> 42:58.700
you were paid to miss, weren't you?

42:59.862 --> 43:02.580
This could substantially
change your defence.

43:03.102 --> 43:07.102
Did Caroline McCoy pay for
that stunt herself?

43:09.822 --> 43:11.580
One blink for yes...

43:12.582 --> 43:14.620
HE MOANS ..two blinks for no.

43:48.622 --> 43:51.261
How many people would it
take to shut this down?

43:51.262 --> 43:54.101
Hospitals don't seem to need
much help these days.

43:54.102 --> 43:56.701
No, no. She's talking about
the death certificate.

43:56.702 --> 43:59.181
Well, there's us and, what,
six staff finishing shift?

43:59.182 --> 44:02.421
Caroline McCoy doesn't know
what he just chose to tell us.

44:02.422 --> 44:06.422
Better still, she doesn't need to
know if he's dead at all.

44:14.022 --> 44:16.061
- Has he gone?
- Far from it, Caroline.

44:16.062 --> 44:18.381
So, how can I help you, lads?

44:18.382 --> 44:20.941
We're activating
your Operation Dead Beckett.

44:20.942 --> 44:22.701
You met your match, didn't you?

44:22.702 --> 44:24.301
We've an odd case transpiring.

44:24.302 --> 44:26.581
- Give me a minute to break it to Dinah.
- I'll do it.

44:26.582 --> 44:28.301
- This is a joke!
- Hey, hey!

44:28.302 --> 44:29.861
Which dress for tonight?

44:29.862 --> 44:32.621
If we don't get her now, we never will.

44:32.622 --> 44:34.661
- Oh, fuck!
- This is karma.

44:34.662 --> 44:37.901
He's not breathing. No pulse.

44:37.902 --> 44:39.901
Oi! Let me out!

44:39.902 --> 44:42.421
If this backfires, that's the lot of us.

44:42.422 --> 44:44.581
- What?
- Take her breath away.

44:44.582 --> 44:46.501
I can't stop thinking about you.

44:46.502 --> 44:47.661
Viv...

44:47.662 --> 44:51.461
We need to string Caroline McCoy up,
or I'm taking her out myself.

44:51.462 --> 44:52.581
I'm not getting in.
