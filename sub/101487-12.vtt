Chris, you've hardly touched
your food.

00:36.353 --> 00:39.020
-Mom, are you a scientist?
-No.

00:39.022 --> 00:42.023
Then quit putting me under
a (bleep) microscope!

00:42.025 --> 00:43.100
Ah, there you are.

00:43.377 --> 00:45.952
Boy, does it feel good
to walk into the right house.

00:46.029 --> 00:48.955
-Hey, Dad,
are you a scientist?
-Don't answer, Peter.

00:49.032 --> 00:51.216
Oh, by the way,
don't make plans for Sunday.

00:51.293 --> 00:53.293
We're taking Stewie
to the children's museum.

00:53.295 --> 00:55.387
Can't go, Lois, I got tickets
to a meaningless

00:55.464 --> 00:56.889
April baseball game.

00:56.965 --> 00:59.132
Now, who wants to come with me
and be as cold as

00:59.134 --> 01:00.801
you've ever been
in your whole life?

01:00.877 --> 01:02.544
-I do.
-Awesome.

01:02.621 --> 01:05.397
We're gonna have a great time,
like flies on dog poop.

01:05.474 --> 01:07.307
(buzzing)

01:07.309 --> 01:10.977
Sorry, gentlemen,
the dog poop is full.

01:11.054 --> 01:12.988
Come on in, ladies.

01:24.159 --> 01:25.826
Why is Meg here?

01:25.828 --> 01:28.495
Something happened last week
and she can't be left alone.

01:28.497 --> 01:30.422
Like, legally.

01:30.499 --> 01:32.816
Meg, where you going?

01:32.818 --> 01:34.484
Come on, Meg,
you got to stay by me.

01:34.486 --> 01:35.986
I wasn't gonna do anything.

01:35.988 --> 01:37.838
Look, it's just a few months.

01:37.990 --> 01:41.174
-Next.
-Hi. Three adults
and one infant, please.

01:41.327 --> 01:43.994
Nice try, lady.
That kid's at least three.

01:43.996 --> 01:46.847
What? That's insane.

01:46.923 --> 01:48.273
Brian, do I look old to you?

01:48.275 --> 01:51.276
You look fine. Guys shouldn't
have those, by the way.

01:51.428 --> 01:53.112
But the museum man--
Meg wandered off.

01:53.188 --> 01:54.446
That may end up being a problem.

01:54.523 --> 01:56.782
The museum man just said
I looked over two.

01:56.784 --> 01:58.450
That's mid-toddler.

01:58.452 --> 01:59.952
I ain't trying to hear that.

02:00.103 --> 02:02.846
Stewie, who cares?
Let's just enjoy the museum.

02:02.848 --> 02:04.790
Uh-oh, frustrated solo parent.

02:04.825 --> 02:07.126
I want the museum
with the pumpkins.

02:07.202 --> 02:09.353
That's the pumpkin patch.
It's gone.

02:09.355 --> 02:11.355
-(crying loudly)
-Get up, Holden.

02:11.357 --> 02:14.115
Holden, get... up.

02:14.193 --> 02:16.117
Get up. God!

02:16.137 --> 02:19.396
-Get up and we'll get a toy.
-Yay.

02:19.398 --> 02:21.531
I'm doing the best I can!

02:21.533 --> 02:23.767
(organ playing "Charge")

02:26.313 --> 02:28.038
Excuse us, coming through.

02:28.040 --> 02:29.148
Both fat. Sorry.

02:29.299 --> 02:30.798
All right, we got it.

02:30.876 --> 02:31.892
What is it,
bottom of the fourth?

02:32.044 --> 02:34.044
My Lord, it's cold.
(gasps)

02:34.046 --> 02:37.214
Chris, look. Two Irish guys
who aren't drinking.

02:37.216 --> 02:39.849
I just got me 30-minute chip.

02:39.885 --> 02:43.387
Well done, lad.
Here's to you.

02:43.405 --> 02:46.556
Oh, well, Finnegan begin again.

02:46.558 --> 02:48.333
<i> ANNOUNCER (over P.A.):</i>
<i> Now batting for Boston,</i>

02:48.410 --> 02:49.893
<i> Xander Bogaerts.</i>

02:49.895 --> 02:51.895
(cheers and applause)

02:51.897 --> 02:53.988
All right, Dad,
I've got my ball ready

02:54.066 --> 02:56.008
in case Xander hits
a glove our way.

02:56.084 --> 02:58.760
Okay, got to talk
more sports with you.

03:02.332 --> 03:04.999
(crowd roaring)

03:05.001 --> 03:06.834
BOTH:
Yeah!

03:06.836 --> 03:08.912
(organ plays)

03:08.914 --> 03:13.007
<i> ANNOUNCER:</i>
<i>Folks, that was Xander Bogaerts'</i>
<i> 200th career home run.</i>

03:13.027 --> 03:15.435
(organ plays)

03:15.512 --> 03:18.012
Heavens to Betsy,
what a home run.

03:18.090 --> 03:20.199
Aye. Now let's take offense
at something

03:20.275 --> 03:22.442
we thought we heard
someone say.

03:22.519 --> 03:24.185
Let's go, Red Sox.

03:24.205 --> 03:26.079
What did you call me?

03:32.046 --> 03:34.454
Now, before you say anything,
Brian,

03:34.531 --> 03:36.048
this is very important to me.

03:38.794 --> 03:40.868
Stewie, what the hell
did you do to yourself?

03:40.888 --> 03:42.203
Nothing. Almost nothing.

03:42.223 --> 03:44.038
Just a little Botox,
a little filler.

03:44.058 --> 03:46.450
-Maybe some strings.
-Stewie, I can't believe...

03:46.452 --> 03:48.393
Oh, there's Meg.
She's wandering outside.

03:48.470 --> 03:50.287
She shouldn't be doing that,
right?

03:50.289 --> 03:52.880
Meg, come back inside.

03:52.900 --> 03:55.459
You're not in trouble,
just come back inside.

03:55.461 --> 03:58.570
She should be in her room
thinking about what she did.

03:58.647 --> 04:00.313
Stewie, this face-lift
was a big mistake.

04:00.466 --> 04:03.316
Like letting ducks be part
of the Boston Tea Party.

04:03.318 --> 04:05.819
We're gonna storm that ship
and get all the tea

04:05.821 --> 04:07.153
and throw it in the water.

04:07.155 --> 04:08.989
(overlapping shouting)

04:08.991 --> 04:11.975
Yeah, but first we're gonna
storm that other ship

04:11.977 --> 04:14.586
and get all the bread
and throw it in the water.

04:14.738 --> 04:17.089
-Who's with me?
-(overlapping murmurs)

04:17.165 --> 04:20.092
And we got to tear the bread
into bite-size pieces

04:20.094 --> 04:23.095
'cause of... for taxes!

04:26.174 --> 04:29.159
Thanks for taking me
to the baseball game, Dad.

04:29.161 --> 04:31.495
It was so fun to watch
the basketball game

04:31.497 --> 04:33.272
on the phone of the guy
in front of us.

04:33.274 --> 04:35.774
Yeah, I like that people are
never doing what they're doing.

04:35.776 --> 04:38.277
Hey, you're the dumpy kid
who caught Xander's homer.

04:38.353 --> 04:39.945
I seen it on the jumbotron.

04:39.947 --> 04:41.947
I'll give you a hundred bucks
for it right now.

04:41.949 --> 04:44.174
Oh, I just brought
this ball from...

04:44.176 --> 04:48.453
Uh, uh, home. Caught from home.
Home plate, where Xander was.

04:48.455 --> 04:50.289
We're gonna need 300 for it.

04:50.365 --> 04:52.849
Hmm. Well, I guess
it's a historic ball.

04:52.851 --> 04:55.610
Okay, you got a deal.

04:55.612 --> 04:59.022
Wow, I can't believe that guy
just paid us $300

04:59.024 --> 05:00.524
for a regular baseball.

05:00.526 --> 05:02.359
Yeah, that was so easy.

05:02.361 --> 05:04.803
Man, people will buy anything
if they think

05:04.954 --> 05:06.305
it's from something famous.

05:06.456 --> 05:09.141
And he didn't even check to see
if that was the real ball.

05:09.292 --> 05:10.958
My God, you're right, Chris.

05:11.036 --> 05:13.370
I bet we could sell
a ton of balls like that,

05:13.372 --> 05:15.981
and maybe other stuff, too,
not just sports.

05:16.058 --> 05:18.875
Hey, what do you say
you and me start

05:18.894 --> 05:20.894
a phony memorabilia business?

05:20.970 --> 05:22.303
-I'm in.
-Great.

05:22.323 --> 05:25.065
Now let's walk through
the dangerous part of the city

05:25.141 --> 05:27.884
'cause Daddy didn't want to pay
three extra bucks for parking.

05:27.886 --> 05:30.978
Aah! Boston University guys,
not Harvard guys!

05:31.056 --> 05:32.238
(cries out)

05:32.391 --> 05:35.292
ALL:
Doy, doy, doy, doy,
doy, doy, doy...

05:41.400 --> 05:43.917
Hey, Chris, what are you up to?

05:43.993 --> 05:46.586
Just finishing our fake
memorabilia website.

05:46.738 --> 05:48.922
-What's this now?
-From last night.

05:48.998 --> 05:50.515
It was your idea.

05:50.667 --> 05:52.075
Oh, I was blacked out.

05:52.094 --> 05:55.336
-You drove us home.
-Yeah, with the window open.

05:55.414 --> 05:57.764
You see, son, fresh air--
Hey, Meg.

05:57.841 --> 05:59.933
Sweetie, where's
your hallway buddy?

06:00.009 --> 06:01.193
Dad, I'm fine.

06:01.269 --> 06:03.344
I know you're fine. I'm fine.
We're all fine.

06:03.364 --> 06:05.197
It's just I'm gonna need you
to go find your hallway buddy.

06:05.273 --> 06:07.949
Okay? There's a good girl.
Thank you.

06:14.041 --> 06:16.023
Oh, my God,
your baby is adorable.

06:16.043 --> 06:19.378
-So cute.
-Let me guess, ten months?

06:19.454 --> 06:22.122
Oh, my God, My new look
is working.

06:22.198 --> 06:24.791
I'm back into months.

06:24.868 --> 06:26.868
Chris, what's all
that lotion for?

06:26.887 --> 06:29.054
Are you a scientist, Mom?

06:29.131 --> 06:32.265
-I'm a scientist.
-It's for masturbating.

06:36.379 --> 06:38.455
Okay, time to hit the road

06:38.457 --> 06:40.457
for the sports and memorabilia
convention.

06:40.459 --> 06:42.142
-Ready to go?
-Yep.

06:42.294 --> 06:44.069
All right, here we go.

06:45.814 --> 06:47.406
I have to go to the bathroom.

06:47.482 --> 06:48.907
Chris, we just left.

06:48.984 --> 06:50.483
I know, but I got to go.

06:50.636 --> 06:53.486
Ah, fine.
We'll pull over at Joe's.

06:53.639 --> 06:56.306
-Bathroom's for customers only.
-(sighs)

06:56.324 --> 06:57.824
All right, how much is the gum?

06:57.826 --> 06:59.476
-Four dollars.
-For gum?

06:59.478 --> 07:02.479
-Go somewhere else.
-Fine.

07:02.481 --> 07:04.998
Bathroom code is
six-six-four-eight-two-

07:05.074 --> 07:06.925
six-one-zero-three-
five-five-four-nine.

07:06.927 --> 07:08.927
Could you--
Could you say that again?

07:08.929 --> 07:10.336
You got to buy
another pack of gum.

07:10.489 --> 07:12.931

Oh, my God, what happened
to your face?

08:07.879 --> 08:10.547
-Stewie?
-Hello? Who's there?

08:10.549 --> 08:13.216
Sorry, Brian, my eyes
don't close when I sleep,

08:13.235 --> 08:15.977
and I'm blind for a few seconds
when I first wake up.

08:16.054 --> 08:18.054
Stewie, you got
more plastic surgery?

08:18.056 --> 08:19.556
I know, it was a mistake.

08:19.558 --> 08:21.391
I told you not to do this.

08:21.393 --> 08:23.393
You're way too young to be
getting plastic surgery.

08:23.411 --> 08:25.486
(whistles nasally)

08:25.564 --> 08:27.397
-Stewie!
-What? Who's there?

Sorry, Brian, my eyes
don't close when I sleep,

and I'm blind for a few seconds
when I first wake up.

08:32.254 --> 08:33.253
Yeah, you already said that.

08:33.663 --> 08:36.239
I think one of the cuts got
too close to my brain.

08:36.258 --> 08:38.241
Brian, school pictures
are in two days.

08:38.301 --> 08:39.759
What am I gonna do?

08:39.836 --> 08:41.335
All right, don't worry.
Here's what we're gonna do.

08:41.413 --> 08:43.096
(Stewie whistles nasally)

08:43.172 --> 08:44.430
-Stewie!
-Who's there?

08:44.507 --> 08:47.341
Oh, Brian, I need your help.
This is a nightmare.

08:47.419 --> 08:49.510
I couldn't afford
Jennifer Aniston's doctor.

Legit Collectibles just had
our biggest sale ever.

09:04.861 --> 09:06.211
Shh, I don't want
your mother to hear.

09:06.288 --> 09:08.029
Don't worry, she won't.

09:08.031 --> 09:10.197
She's on the phone with
her dramatic friend Gina.

09:10.217 --> 09:12.366
No, I believe you saw a ghost,

09:12.386 --> 09:15.128
but y-you talked to him
for 45 minutes?

09:15.130 --> 09:17.055
Maybe that part was a dream.

09:17.132 --> 09:18.798
Okay, what'd we sell?

09:18.800 --> 09:21.042
You know the captain's hat
we said Sully Sullenberger

09:21.061 --> 09:23.061
was wearing when he landed
in the Hudson?

09:23.138 --> 09:25.972
Someone bought it off
our website for five grand.

09:26.049 --> 09:28.474
No way.
What moron paid that much?

09:28.551 --> 09:31.886
Um, someone named
Obi-Wan Quagmire.

09:31.888 --> 09:33.479
Obi-Wan Quagmire.

old Glenn Quagmire.

13:22.527 --> 13:25.053

Chris, you are now Colin

to veterans.

13:32.128 --> 13:34.220
-Got it.
-Would you like
any more details?

13:34.297 --> 13:37.723
Dad, I'm an ear salesman.
I got it.

13:37.725 --> 13:41.802
And I'm Mr. Fields, husband
of cookie legend Mrs. Fields.

13:41.880 --> 13:43.470
You could pick anyone
and you chose

13:43.548 --> 13:45.882

of somebody famous?

13:47.977 --> 13:49.402

No, no, no, it's fine,
it's fine.

13:57.912 --> 13:59.562
We-we both realized
the physical thing

13:59.564 --> 14:02.006
wasn't working for us anymore
and we sleep much better

14:02.008 --> 14:04.158
in our separate bedrooms
in the same house.

14:04.160 --> 14:07.086

how I like it.

14:07.163 --> 14:10.239

this is gonna work.

14:23.179 --> 14:25.029
What you keep looking at, Peter?

14:25.106 --> 14:27.014
Do you know about some terror?

14:27.033 --> 14:30.034
No, no, relax. I'm-I'm just, uh,
just curious to see

14:30.186 --> 14:32.186
what Quagmire's gonna be
wearing when he gets here.

14:32.263 --> 14:36.023
(chuckles) I think our outfits
are pretty much set, Pete.

14:36.042 --> 14:39.193
Check it out, guys,
a piece of aviation history:

14:39.212 --> 14:41.120
the cap Sully Sullenberger wore

14:41.197 --> 14:42.863
when he landed
in the Hudson River.

14:42.865 --> 14:44.215
Whoa, that's his actual hat?

14:44.292 --> 14:46.551
Yep. Want to smell
Sully's sweat?

14:46.553 --> 14:48.720
(sniffs)
I don't smell anything.

14:48.796 --> 14:52.965
That's right.
'Cause Sully never sweats.

14:52.967 --> 14:55.376
Is this someone
white people know?

14:55.453 --> 14:57.470
I'm gonna get it signed
by the man himself.

14:57.472 --> 15:00.732
Wait, Sully's alive?
And you're gonna show it to him?

15:00.808 --> 15:02.400
Sure am. He's doing
a signing tomorrow

15:02.435 --> 15:04.127
at the airport bookstore.

15:04.129 --> 15:06.145
Uh, hey, listen, I don't know
about this plan, Glenn.

15:06.297 --> 15:08.481
Uh, nobody likes to see
their old hats.

15:08.483 --> 15:09.966
Hey, if you're gonna be
at the airport,

15:09.968 --> 15:11.817
could you pick me up
a $45 neck pillow

15:11.894 --> 15:14.078
I'll forget to pack
for my next trip?

15:14.155 --> 15:16.155
-I love this hat.
-You know, Quagmire,

15:16.232 --> 15:18.324
I was gonna be at the airport
tomorrow anyway.

15:18.326 --> 15:20.251
Why don't I take your hat
and get it signed for you?

15:20.328 --> 15:21.994
Why are you going
to the airport?

15:21.996 --> 15:23.496
I want to hang out
with the boarding group B

15:23.648 --> 15:25.256
cell phone holster guys.

15:25.333 --> 15:26.907
It's mostly just standing around

15:26.985 --> 15:29.761
and asking each other
if we're also in group B.

15:29.837 --> 15:31.654
Do you also ask if group B
has boarded yet,

15:31.673 --> 15:34.157
and "is this the line
for boarding group B?"

15:34.159 --> 15:36.826
Yeah, you know it, Joe.
Are you a boarding group B guy?

15:36.828 --> 15:38.344
(laughs):
Me? Oh.

15:38.496 --> 15:40.346
No, no, no, no, no.

15:40.498 --> 15:43.924
I, uh, I get on early
with the babies.

15:44.002 --> 15:44.943
Look, I'm already
gonna be there,

15:44.945 --> 15:46.836
so you should just
give me the hat.

15:46.838 --> 15:48.446
Yeah, thanks for the offer,
but I'm not passing up

15:48.448 --> 15:50.506
a chance to meet my hero.

15:50.508 --> 15:53.826
Is this the guy
we're talking about?

15:58.199 --> 16:00.458
Wow, I can't believe this.

16:00.609 --> 16:02.961
Daryl Hannah,
it is an absolute pleasure.

16:02.963 --> 16:05.855
-I loved you in<i> Splash.</i>
-No, Doctor, this is Stewie.

16:05.857 --> 16:07.465
He needs you to help
fix his face.

16:07.616 --> 16:09.283
Oh, absolutely, I can do that.

16:09.360 --> 16:11.452
Great. Is it a simple procedure?

16:11.529 --> 16:13.863
Oh, sure. We just break
every bone in his face

16:13.865 --> 16:16.165
and then smush 'em back
into position.

16:16.201 --> 16:19.035
Dr. Hartman, where'd you get
your medical degree from?

16:19.037 --> 16:21.871
I went to BU.
You know our fight song, right?

16:21.873 --> 16:24.899

<i>doy, doy, doy, doy, doy, doy.</i> ♪

16:30.231 --> 16:32.215

16:32.217 --> 16:35.218
Wow. Dr. Hartman
really did a good job.

16:35.220 --> 16:37.978
Yep. He told me bed rest
and ice packs for two days

16:38.056 --> 16:40.556
so it can set, but I'm not
missing picture day.

16:40.575 --> 16:43.150

listen to the doctor?

16:43.228 --> 16:45.878

16:59.168 --> 17:02.169
I do, I do.
We've come a long way.

17:02.171 --> 17:05.064
We've come a lot of ways.

17:10.196 --> 17:12.030
All right, Chris,
we got to stop Quagmire

17:12.106 --> 17:13.923
from meeting
Captain Sullenberger.

17:13.925 --> 17:16.517
Only thing is, since 9/11,
you can't run in airports,

17:16.536 --> 17:19.287
so we got to fat-guy
hustle-walk our way there.

17:27.530 --> 17:29.121
Oh, no. We're too late.

17:29.198 --> 17:31.883
We shouldn't have stopped
for that airport Toblerone.

17:31.959 --> 17:35.094
We had to.
It's like European shark teeth.

17:37.131 --> 17:40.466
Hold on,
Sully's looking at the hat.

17:40.468 --> 17:42.209
It is an honor to meet you, sir.

17:42.228 --> 17:44.470
And it was an honor
to purchase the actual hat

17:44.472 --> 17:46.338
you wore on that fateful day.

17:46.340 --> 17:48.974
-You know, I'm a pilot myself.
-Oh, you are?

17:49.051 --> 17:50.902
What's your record
for longest "uh"?

17:51.053 --> 17:52.978
-Eleven seconds.
-Let's hear it.

17:53.055 --> 17:55.990
Folks, from the tower, uh...

18:05.643 --> 18:07.251
...they've
cleared us to push back,

18:07.403 --> 18:08.753
we'll be departing shortly.

18:08.830 --> 18:12.148
Hey, that's great.
My personal best is 34 sec...

18:12.150 --> 18:14.150
34 seconds in Tulsa, Oklahoma.

18:14.152 --> 18:17.929
I know. The Tulsa Uh.
As I said, big fan.

18:22.102 --> 18:23.434
Here you go.

18:25.105 --> 18:27.105
Thank you, sir.

18:30.335 --> 18:33.169
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have to go back to my life

18:33.171 --> 18:36.355
as the most famous Chesley
who's ever lived.

18:36.432 --> 18:38.783
This is the greatest day
of my life.

18:38.860 --> 18:40.676
(squealing)

18:40.678 --> 18:41.953
-(liquid splatters)
-MAN: Ow, my smoothie.

18:42.029 --> 18:44.956
MAN 2:
Ow, mine, too.
I'm on the other side.

18:45.107 --> 18:48.442
I can't believe it. Sully didn't
tell him the hat was fake.

18:48.519 --> 18:52.204
Well, he's not that smart.
He did crash a plane.

18:52.281 --> 18:54.298
Excuse me, uh,
Captain Sullenberger,

18:54.300 --> 18:56.192
I was just wondering
why you pretended

18:56.194 --> 18:57.951
that was your real hat
just then.

18:58.029 --> 18:59.862
-Well, Peter...
-I never said my name.

18:59.864 --> 19:01.455
...when my plane was going down,

19:01.532 --> 19:04.625
I remembered a famous saying
we have in aviation.

19:04.702 --> 19:09.538
It goes, "Chesley is a perfectly
normal name for a person."

19:09.540 --> 19:12.266
And what it means is, you
have to believe in yourself.

19:12.301 --> 19:15.044
I didn't think I could land
my plane in the Hudson,

19:15.046 --> 19:16.896
but I believed I could.

19:16.898 --> 19:19.882
And that belief gave me
the courage to try.

19:19.901 --> 19:22.385
So, if that man
believes he has my hat,

19:22.387 --> 19:25.163
maybe that'll make him
a little bit better husband...

19:25.239 --> 19:26.480
-Nope.
-Little better dad...

19:26.557 --> 19:28.224
-Nope.
-Little better sex character

19:28.242 --> 19:30.817
who doesn't play as well
in the Me Too era.

19:30.895 --> 19:32.395
Oh, so you do watch the show.

19:32.413 --> 19:35.231
It's on,
i-it's on a lot of planes.

19:35.249 --> 19:39.402
All I know is,
I didn't save 155 souls

19:39.420 --> 19:43.088
on the Hudson
just to shatter dreams on land.

19:43.165 --> 19:46.184
You know what? You're as good
a guy as they say.

19:46.260 --> 19:48.761
Hey, why do they call this place
the Hudson News?

19:48.837 --> 19:50.337

it's because they're owned

20:29.378 --> 20:31.136
(beeping)

20:31.138 --> 20:33.806

20:33.882 --> 20:36.067

20:40.889 --> 20:42.823
(panting)

20:50.399 --> 20:53.084
Hey, Meg?
Where's your creek buddy?

20:53.160 --> 20:56.328
You're not in any trouble,
you just need a creek buddy.

20:56.330 --> 20:58.089
(helicopter blades whirring)
