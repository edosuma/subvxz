09:01.833 --> 09:03.708
Trust the process.

09:03.794 --> 09:05.252
- Such a cool workshop.

09:05.337 --> 09:07.837
- It actually
used to be a volcano.

09:07.923 --> 09:09.214
- Hard to believe.

09:09.258 --> 09:11.132
Aren't you gonna ask
how I picked your lock?

09:11.176 --> 09:12.676
- You turned
the third cylinder.

09:12.719 --> 09:13.885
I designed it that way.

09:13.929 --> 09:15.720
- Who designs
a lock to be picked?

09:15.764 --> 09:18.515
- Come here.

09:21.061 --> 09:25.105
You know, I was also born
with certain challenges.

09:25.190 --> 09:29.693
- No offense, heph,
I can't breathe or walk.

09:29.778 --> 09:32.279
But I will allow
the comparison.

09:32.322 --> 09:34.656
- When I was born,
my parents threw me away.

09:34.741 --> 09:36.116
I don't mean that figuratively.

09:36.201 --> 09:38.118
My dad could throw, you know?

09:38.161 --> 09:39.953
He threw lightning
for a living.

09:40.038 --> 09:41.121
I went...
[whistling]

09:41.164 --> 09:43.081
Far.
- That sucks.

09:43.125 --> 09:44.833
- Glad it happened.
Made me what I am.

09:44.876 --> 09:46.918
You know who my wife is?
- Aphrodite.

09:46.962 --> 09:48.545
- And what's that say
about the gods?

09:48.630 --> 09:51.089
- They're tolerant of incest?
- You know what family is?

09:51.133 --> 09:53.008
I figured this out.
It's a disease.

09:53.051 --> 09:54.509
You're born with it.

09:54.553 --> 09:56.845
You have no say in the one
you get, and you don't need it,

09:56.930 --> 09:58.847
But, boy, does it need you.

09:58.932 --> 10:00.307
I designed that lock
to be picked

10:00.350 --> 10:03.018
Because my father
is an insane bully,

10:03.103 --> 10:05.228
Just like prometheus,
just like heracles,

10:05.314 --> 10:07.814
Who everyone thinks
freed prometheus

10:07.899 --> 10:09.983
Because handsome,
stupid asses

10:10.068 --> 10:11.359
Think they run the world.

10:11.445 --> 10:15.947
And that's how ugly,
smart people like it.

10:15.991 --> 10:19.784
- Is it possible
for the brain to get a boner?

10:19.828 --> 10:22.120
<i> [upbeat music]</i>

10:22.122 --> 10:24.080
- Got anything warm
and comforting?

10:24.082 --> 10:26.082
- My mother-in-law
is lactating.

10:26.126 --> 10:27.334
- I'll have a beer.

10:27.461 --> 10:29.711
- Hey, want to hear
a derogatory joke

10:29.755 --> 10:30.754
About inventors?

10:30.839 --> 10:32.213
I assume you're also a king

10:32.299 --> 10:34.716
That paid to bring
his science dork here

10:34.801 --> 10:35.884
And got ditched?

10:35.927 --> 10:37.594
I'm minos from crete.

10:37.679 --> 10:40.722
- Tyrannis, krapopolis.
What's the joke?

10:40.807 --> 10:42.682
- What do you get
what an inventor

10:42.726 --> 10:44.476
Crosses your wife with a bull?

10:44.519 --> 10:49.064
A flesh-eating monstrosity that
has to be kept in a labyrinth.

10:49.149 --> 10:51.650
I guess you had to be there.
- Ah!

10:51.735 --> 10:53.318
Ugh, what is this?

10:53.362 --> 10:55.320
- Oh, you ordered the beer.
So sorry.

10:55.364 --> 10:57.030
- Well, don't give me
that one now.

10:57.074 --> 10:59.157
- New one's gonna take a while.

10:59.201 --> 11:02.911
- Then I'll have a free beer
while I wait.

11:02.996 --> 11:07.957
Non-kings.
- Oh, non-kings.

11:08.001 --> 11:10.210
- How long are you gonna
let this go on for?

11:10.295 --> 11:11.920
- I don't see
any downside to letting

11:11.963 --> 11:13.213
Your mother keep trying.

11:22.641 --> 11:24.432
I've got to work this out
before the shipment

11:24.476 --> 11:27.310
Of new servants
gets here from thebes.

11:27.396 --> 11:29.104
- I think it might be time
for you to admit

11:29.189 --> 11:32.440
You don't know how to reverse
a medusa stoning

11:32.526 --> 11:33.650
And give up.

11:33.694 --> 11:35.151
- Hubris!

11:35.237 --> 11:37.112
[gasps]
what have I done?

11:37.155 --> 11:39.280
- Don't blame yourself.
This is mostly my fault.

11:39.366 --> 11:41.366
I saw you struggling,
and I let you go on

11:41.451 --> 11:43.368
Because I didn't want
to hurt your feelings.

11:43.453 --> 11:46.079
- No, I've been so consumed
with proving

11:46.123 --> 11:48.790
I could undo
athena's hacky monster nonsense

11:48.834 --> 11:51.126
That I overreacted a bit.

11:51.211 --> 11:53.169
- At least I know stupendous
won't eat me.

11:53.213 --> 11:57.465
That girl's never touched
a vegetable in her entire life.

12:03.014 --> 12:04.681
- Where have you been?

12:04.725 --> 12:06.224
Are you hungover?

12:06.268 --> 12:07.934
- It's called
still being drunk.

12:08.061 --> 12:09.227
There's a difference.

12:09.312 --> 12:11.187
- Hephaestus offered me a job.

12:11.273 --> 12:13.648
- So why are you even here?
- What's that mean?

12:13.692 --> 12:14.774
I want to talk to you about it.

12:14.901 --> 12:16.317
- You mean gloat about it.

12:16.361 --> 12:20.113
You want me to beg you
to do me the favor of breeding

12:20.157 --> 12:21.322
My wife with a bull?

12:21.366 --> 12:23.533
- When did you get either
of those things?

12:23.618 --> 12:24.826
- It's a metaphor.

12:24.870 --> 12:26.536
- You're the one
that called me useless!

12:26.580 --> 12:27.746
- Is that what I said?

12:27.914 --> 12:30.123
You're so creative
about remembering what I say,

12:30.208 --> 12:33.042
Do you remember me asking you
to invent written language?

12:33.086 --> 12:35.086
- It's a bad idea.

12:35.172 --> 12:36.713
- I'll have to take
your word for it.

12:36.798 --> 12:39.257
I guess everything I ask for
is beneath your genius,

12:39.342 --> 12:41.301
So it's no loss
to me if you quit.

12:41.386 --> 12:44.012
- Now there's an idea
I can get behind.

12:44.055 --> 12:45.472
- Wow.
I did it, everybody.

12:45.515 --> 12:49.017
I finally got smart enough

- Guys, stop nerd fighting.

12:55.066 --> 12:56.983
- I'm a king.
- Okay, well--

12:57.068 --> 12:58.151
- I know I'm nerdy for a king.

12:58.195 --> 12:59.360
That doesn't make it
a nerd fight.

12:59.446 --> 13:02.280
- What's this all about?
- Just saying goodbye.

13:02.365 --> 13:04.783
- What about all your stuff?
- Give it away.

13:04.868 --> 13:08.328
- Even your fully articulated,
life-size wooden lady?

13:08.371 --> 13:09.579
- I don't know
what you're describing,

13:09.664 --> 13:11.915
But it sounds way less shameful
than snooping.

13:11.958 --> 13:13.208
Goodbye, tyrannis.

13:13.335 --> 13:14.918
- Oh, I'm not leaving just yet.

13:38.819 --> 13:39.692
There are none.

13:39.736 --> 13:41.152

13:41.196 --> 13:43.863

- Got it. What do I do first?

13:43.907 --> 13:45.949
- First, you never
ask that again.

13:46.034 --> 13:47.367
- Sorry.
- I really mean it, hippo.

13:47.494 --> 13:49.994
Your job here
is simply to create,

13:50.080 --> 13:52.121
Preferably three or four things
before sundown.

13:52.207 --> 13:53.706
And if anything
you come up with

13:53.792 --> 13:57.377
Becomes a hephaestus original,
well, there's upward movement.

13:57.462 --> 14:01.631
- So my job is to create
hephaestus originals?

14:01.675 --> 14:05.218
- Okay, don't flatter yourself.
I'm not exploiting you.

14:05.262 --> 14:08.221
By the time I'm done
making your stuff work,

14:08.265 --> 14:10.265
You'll be the one getting
the undeserved credit,

14:10.308 --> 14:12.141
Which trust me,
you will take

14:12.185 --> 14:14.143
When you leave me
for a better job.

- Oh, I'm not gonna leave.
- Oh, yes, you will.

14:17.232 --> 14:20.149
You didn't get here by being
loyal to your stupid brother,

14:20.151 --> 14:21.943
Did you?
It's okay.

14:22.028 --> 14:24.988
I expect you to leave.
I'm not stupid.

14:25.031 --> 14:29.284
I'm arguably the god
of the opposite of stupid.

14:29.411 --> 14:31.786
And I'd rather work
with genuine talent

14:31.830 --> 14:34.372

14:34.416 --> 14:37.041
- Maybe I can be both.
- I welcome the attempt.

14:37.127 --> 14:38.835
People do earn my trust--

14:38.879 --> 14:40.712
To an extent.

I have the only heart

aren't we?

14:56.980 --> 14:59.981
- So you'd call yourself
a collaborative inventor?

15:00.066 --> 15:02.358
- Yes, I believe
it's more important

15:02.444 --> 15:05.570
To collaborate than innovate.
- Ah, so refreshing.

15:05.614 --> 15:08.072
I'm interested in my city
developing written language.

15:08.116 --> 15:09.949
- Nope, not a thing.
- Not a thing?

15:09.993 --> 15:13.328
- Human speak words
and they draw pictures.

15:13.413 --> 15:16.164
Nobody can draw
pictures of words.

15:16.291 --> 15:20.084
That's nonsense.
- And is this us collaborating?

15:20.211 --> 15:22.128
- Well,
there's collaborating,

15:22.213 --> 15:24.297
And there's indulging
childish fantasy.

15:24.382 --> 15:27.133
You see some futuristic world

what was the other thing?

15:32.515 --> 15:35.266

15:37.187 --> 15:38.978

thinking about this?

15:39.064 --> 15:40.480

in your position.

15:40.523 --> 15:45.109
- Then I'm afraid
this interview is over.

15:45.195 --> 15:47.236

but if you can,

15:49.199 --> 15:50.990

invents ranch dressing

In the near future,
I should be all right.

15:55.372 --> 15:57.830

are having personal growth,

15:57.874 --> 15:59.415
But felix has kids.

15:59.501 --> 16:02.543
- And that is why you should
take him to athena's temple,

16:02.587 --> 16:05.213
Which I now allow because
I am capable of everything,

16:05.298 --> 16:07.715
Including change.
- Okay.

16:07.801 --> 16:08.883

Since I could have walked
by now.

Piss off.

an eye on felix while I pack?

even as part carrot.

Oh, yes.

16:24.150 --> 16:25.984
Now you're talking.

16:26.027 --> 16:27.902
No, I want him to watch.

16:27.988 --> 16:30.488
Very good.
Oh, yes.

16:38.206 --> 16:40.289

inventors at the dock.

16:40.333 --> 16:44.002
Whoever gets the job gets
an entire lab in his palace--

16:44.129 --> 16:46.254
With underground lair.

16:46.297 --> 16:48.381
- That's my--

Probably in the middle
of nowhere.

16:50.093 --> 16:52.093

Small pond, big fish.

16:52.137 --> 16:54.721
Sorry, is that offensive
to you?

16:54.806 --> 16:56.014

16:56.099 --> 16:57.390
- I hear this king
is interested

A sewage system,

17:00.478 --> 17:01.978
Written language.

17:02.063 --> 17:03.980
- See, now that's offensive.

17:04.065 --> 17:05.523
I mean, is he a king
or a creative?

17:05.567 --> 17:08.026
Hephaestus doesn't even care
what we invent.

17:08.028 --> 17:09.193
- You got that right.

17:09.237 --> 17:10.737
- This king
you're talking about,

17:10.822 --> 17:12.155
He'll be all up in your stuff.

17:12.240 --> 17:13.990
How's it going?
What are you working on?

17:14.075 --> 17:15.283
I have thoughts.

17:15.410 --> 17:17.076
He's going to think
he owns you.

17:17.120 --> 17:20.246
- Free lab, room and board.
Um, own me, daddy.

17:20.331 --> 17:22.957

don't apply for the job.

17:43.521 --> 17:46.189
- Hermes had thoughts
about his hat,

17:46.232 --> 17:48.024
And here,
you're surrounded by--

17:48.068 --> 17:49.734
What's this?
- I don't know.

17:49.819 --> 17:51.152
It's called a computer.

17:51.237 --> 17:53.279
It's a machine
that calculates--

17:53.323 --> 17:55.323
Why do you feel comfortable
interrupting me like this?

17:55.408 --> 17:57.200
Are you unfamiliar
with being fired?

17:57.243 --> 17:58.618
- I guess I've only ever quit.

17:58.703 --> 18:01.621
A machine that calculates?
- Oh, does that impress you?

18:01.664 --> 18:04.707
- It might be a little more
important than a third draft

18:04.751 --> 18:06.125
Of hermes's hat.

18:06.211 --> 18:07.794
- Well, can I show you
something even better?

18:07.837 --> 18:09.587
- Yeah!

18:09.631 --> 18:11.047
Dude?

18:11.132 --> 18:12.590
- Dude!
Wait.

18:12.675 --> 18:13.716
It gets better.

18:13.793 --> 18:14.884
Look at this.

18:14.969 --> 18:16.552
What do you think, dude?

18:16.596 --> 18:18.096
You like that, dude?

18:18.139 --> 18:19.347
- Why?
Why?

18:19.390 --> 18:22.225
- Because it's not
what you wanted.

18:22.268 --> 18:26.145
So now you understand,
you don't control me.

18:26.231 --> 18:28.397
- But hermes does?
- No!

18:28.483 --> 18:33.111
You insipid little fish man,
I control everything.

18:33.238 --> 18:37.406
I choose my jobs.
I choose my goals.

18:37.492 --> 18:40.952
I have already finished proving
I am better than everyone

18:41.037 --> 18:43.746
And that I don't need anyone.

18:43.832 --> 18:45.414
I guess
you haven't proven that?

18:45.458 --> 18:48.501
I have!
It's a thing you can prove.

18:48.545 --> 18:52.380
And do you know what I now
have decided to make happen?

18:52.465 --> 18:56.050
- You want them to like you.
- There you go, buddy!

18:56.136 --> 18:58.010
There you go.

18:58.054 --> 19:00.179
Is that okay with you?

19:01.141 --> 19:03.891
Remember when
your brother tried

19:03.977 --> 19:06.060
To protect you at the panel?

19:06.104 --> 19:11.732
Nobody in my family, nobody,
has done that for me.

19:13.862 --> 19:16.279
- Ty, wait!

19:16.364 --> 19:20.074
Ty!
- Hold on one moment.

19:20.118 --> 19:21.826
- Excuse me.
Excuse me.

19:21.870 --> 19:25.204
- Hippo!
- Ty!

19:25.290 --> 19:27.957
I'm sorry.
- I am too.

19:28.001 --> 19:29.417
What happened?

19:29.502 --> 19:31.419
- Well, I was definitely
right to change jobs

19:31.462 --> 19:33.171
Because I'm right
about everything,

19:33.256 --> 19:35.173
Which is why I had to leave.

19:35.258 --> 19:37.008
They found me
mentally intimidating

19:37.093 --> 19:39.635
And distracting sexually.

19:39.721 --> 19:42.054
- That's truly unbelievable.

19:42.098 --> 19:44.432
But I'm glad it happened
because you're irreplaceable.

19:44.559 --> 19:47.560
- I would have invented
your brains out.

19:47.687 --> 19:48.686
Lab wrecker.

19:50.106 --> 19:52.481
- Who was that?
- I didn't see anybody.

19:52.567 --> 19:55.735
- Hephaestus thanks you
for attending volcon.

19:55.820 --> 19:57.737
I am not an automaton.

19:57.822 --> 19:59.906
I am a living, suffering giant.

19:59.949 --> 20:01.282
Have a safe journey home.

20:01.367 --> 20:04.327
My joints are limited
to predefined movements

20:04.412 --> 20:06.954
Carried out by
a complex system of gears.

20:07.081 --> 20:09.749
We look forward
to seeing you next year.

20:09.834 --> 20:11.584
Enjoy your lives.

20:11.628 --> 20:12.752
They could be worse.

20:12.837 --> 20:14.128
I have a family.

20:14.172 --> 20:16.714
I'm a foodie.
I love to travel.

20:16.758 --> 20:21.344
Tell my story, but also,
tell the world about volcon.

20:21.387 --> 20:24.889
I have had an itch
on my back for over a year.

20:24.974 --> 20:27.016
Someone, please scratch it.

20:27.018 --> 20:29.268
And please,
come back to volcon.

20:29.354 --> 20:32.188
Before this,
I was a giant doctor.

20:32.273 --> 20:34.106
I saved people's lives,

20:34.150 --> 20:36.141
The way
you should save the date

20:36.152 --> 20:38.444
For next year's volcon.

20:53.211 --> 20:56.212
- Ah.

20:59.634 --> 21:02.593
[indistinct chatter]

21:06.057 --> 21:10.810
[sighs]
hello, print-con!

21:10.895 --> 21:12.144
I'm chris hardwick.

21:12.230 --> 21:14.855
I'm moderating this panel
and, due to a curse,

21:14.941 --> 21:16.974
All panels
until the end of time.

21:16.985 --> 21:19.735
But you didn't sleep
on a pile of plague rats

21:19.779 --> 21:21.570
For a month to hear about me.

21:21.614 --> 21:24.115
You're here
for the prince of the press,

21:24.200 --> 21:29.537
The mage of the page,
johann gutenberg!

21:29.831 --> 21:31.080
<i> - Did you get any of that?</i>

21:33.668 --> 21:35.126
<i> - Bento.</i>
