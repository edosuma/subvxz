WEBVTT

00:42.459 --> 00:43.418
Ah!

01:01.102 --> 01:02.187
Miss!

01:02.979 --> 01:04.314
Listen to me!

01:05.940 --> 01:08.151
You don't have
to do this!

01:13.615 --> 01:15.158
What's your name, love?

01:16.993 --> 01:19.412
Put the bag down for me.

01:28.630 --> 01:30.799
Open the bag for me, Miss.

01:45.897 --> 01:50.235
-Okay... we've got
eyes on the baby.
-Eyes on that baby.

01:53.404 --> 01:55.323
Okay, put your hands
where I can see them.

01:56.574 --> 01:59.994
And walk slowly
towards me.

02:27.981 --> 02:29.399
Oh, Christ.

02:31.776 --> 02:32.902
Oh, Christ!

03:00.889 --> 03:02.765
Eat shit,
my friends.

03:02.849 --> 03:05.768
-Ugh, you're pitiless.

03:05.852 --> 03:08.479
Don't hate the player...
hate the game.

03:08.563 --> 03:11.274
-Yeah, but you always win.
-'Cause I'm the best.

03:11.357 --> 03:12.400
Every time.

03:12.483 --> 03:13.276
-Hm?
-Nah.

03:13.359 --> 03:15.445
-Mm-mm?
-Nah, nah. I shouldn't.

03:15.528 --> 03:16.821
Mmm.

03:21.200 --> 03:22.994
All right, gimme a puff.

03:24.120 --> 03:25.955
Gimme these,
gimme that,

03:26.039 --> 03:27.165
and gimme these.

03:29.834 --> 03:31.419
Hittin' the spot, right?

03:39.636 --> 03:41.346
Sorry.

03:41.429 --> 03:43.306
All right,
I'll be back in a sec.

03:48.061 --> 03:49.646
Thought she was leaving
her with Jamie tonight.

03:49.729 --> 03:51.856
-Hey, Mommy's coming.
-He had to work late.

03:52.774 --> 03:54.567
Come on, it's fine.

03:54.651 --> 04:00.031
No, no, no, no, Rita Skeeter.
Poker nights are sacred.

04:00.114 --> 04:01.908
You agree with me.
I know you do.

04:01.991 --> 04:03.743
I know what that
little smile means.

04:03.826 --> 04:06.245
Sorry, she won't go down.

04:06.329 --> 04:09.999
-Left her bloody BunBun at home.
-It's all right.

04:10.083 --> 04:11.793
-She can join in.
-What's a BunBun?

04:11.876 --> 04:15.171
Oh, it's this
Norwegian sleeping aid.
It's amazing.

04:15.254 --> 04:18.049
Honestly, it would
get her to sleep
on a fuckin' airfield.

04:18.132 --> 04:19.342
Hello!

04:19.425 --> 04:25.139
-Oh, Tash, sorry. Could you--
-Oh. Mm... Sorry.

04:27.100 --> 04:28.434
You all right, pal?

04:28.518 --> 04:30.728
Oh yeah.

04:30.812 --> 04:36.484
-Tash, I don't wanna
wind her up, yeah?
-Got it, sorry.

04:36.567 --> 04:39.153
This was so damn tasty.

04:39.237 --> 04:42.073
Mm, it's pepperpot.
It's my daddy's special recipe.

04:42.156 --> 04:44.450
Still some left, though, which
means I didn't make it right.

04:44.534 --> 04:46.661
I miss Daddy Lyle.
How's he doin'?

04:46.744 --> 04:50.289
You know what?
He's all right, actually.

04:50.373 --> 04:53.042
-Yeah, he's--
-Aww.

04:53.126 --> 04:57.005
Hey, Tash, tell Mags
about that weirdo who
came in on Monday.

04:57.088 --> 04:59.465
-Oh yeah.
Mags, you'll love this.
-Hm?

04:59.549 --> 05:02.552
So, I'm in the restaurant,
about to close the kitchen,

05:02.635 --> 05:06.597
this guy comes in with
these two well-old women--

05:06.681 --> 05:07.682
Silly.

05:09.308 --> 05:10.226
Sorry, carry on.

05:10.310 --> 05:13.604
Yeah, so these ladies
are old, all right?

05:13.688 --> 05:17.400
-And this guy is hot in, like,
a second cousin kind of way.

05:22.947 --> 05:24.407
Mm-mm, she hasn't pooed.

05:32.123 --> 05:35.585
Sorry.
That was disgusting,
wasn't it?

05:35.668 --> 05:39.422
I think I've forgotten
how normal people behave.

05:39.505 --> 05:45.803
It's just a lot, you know?
All the time... Forever.

05:46.763 --> 05:48.056
But it is how it is.

05:48.139 --> 05:50.516
-Is it better?

05:51.476 --> 05:52.602
What?

05:54.062 --> 05:56.898
Like, is it better...
than before you had the kid?

05:56.981 --> 05:58.733
-Tash.
-Nah, it's okay.

05:58.816 --> 06:00.234
It's a fair question.

06:00.318 --> 06:01.402
Um...

06:04.655 --> 06:05.907
Don't know.

06:08.034 --> 06:09.577
It's hard to explain.

06:12.997 --> 06:15.917
Love you, Mags...
ya dick.

06:19.337 --> 06:20.421
Mm! No.

06:22.215 --> 06:23.549
Are you gonna tell her?

06:25.384 --> 06:27.053
Tell me what?

06:27.136 --> 06:28.805
Tash, I've got some news.

06:30.264 --> 06:31.474
I'm pregnant.

06:32.225 --> 06:34.685
Fuuuck, duuude.

06:34.769 --> 06:38.815
That's amazin'.
Congrats!

06:38.898 --> 06:42.443
Congratulations.
Wow. Are you happy?

06:42.527 --> 06:45.947
-Yeah, yeah.
-Oh yeah, that's awesome.

06:46.030 --> 06:49.784
Cheers to that.
Mm? Ay!

06:51.202 --> 06:52.995
Mm, you know what?

06:53.079 --> 06:57.458
Let's celebrate... by lettin'
Rita win the next hand.

06:57.542 --> 07:00.211
-Yes!
-What you got, bellends?

07:02.755 --> 07:03.965
Oh, leave it.

07:05.258 --> 07:07.468
-What?
-Leave it, she's fine.

07:07.552 --> 07:09.345
Let's just play the game.

07:09.428 --> 07:11.722
What is up with you?

07:14.976 --> 07:16.853
All three of us have
put aside tonight, yeah,

07:16.936 --> 07:18.896
-in our very busy lives--
-Yeah.

07:18.980 --> 07:21.315
in order to spend
time together.

07:21.399 --> 07:23.526
That means we listen
to each other's stories

07:23.609 --> 07:25.278
even if they're
not as interesting

07:25.361 --> 07:28.239
as whether or not
your child shat herself.

07:29.365 --> 07:31.409
-I'm sorry.

07:31.492 --> 07:32.743
Am I bein' rude?

07:32.827 --> 07:35.413
Should we go
back to pretending
we're hangin' out?

07:35.496 --> 07:36.622
You know what?

07:37.415 --> 07:38.499
Fuck this.

07:39.250 --> 07:41.043
Do you want a lift?

07:41.127 --> 07:43.337
Uh... I'll be
there in a minute.

07:53.347 --> 07:56.100
Are you gonna turn
into a massive asshole
when you have a baby?

07:56.184 --> 08:00.062
-No promises.
-Mm. How pregnant are you?

08:00.146 --> 08:01.939
Three months.

08:02.023 --> 08:04.567
So, it's not too late.

08:06.569 --> 08:08.654
I'm joking.

08:08.738 --> 08:10.198
-It's a joke!
-No.

08:10.281 --> 08:13.784
It's a joke! Christ!

08:13.868 --> 08:18.623
I love you, and I'm sorry
you're finding this hard.

09:01.499 --> 09:03.042
Yeah, I'm thinking

09:03.125 --> 09:05.002
I need to go away
for a couple of days,

09:05.086 --> 09:06.379
and, you know...

09:08.214 --> 09:11.175
-figure out why I'm so unhappy.
-Jinn Right.

09:11.259 --> 09:13.928
So, you're not comin' in
for your shift today?

09:14.011 --> 09:16.097
Right.

09:16.180 --> 09:18.015
Kitchen'll be all right
without me, yeah?

09:18.099 --> 09:21.060
I think we'll survive.

09:21.143 --> 09:24.063
Well, if you keep oversalting
those sardines, you won't.

09:29.026 --> 09:30.152
Fuck off.

09:32.530 --> 09:35.032
-Stevo!
-Yes, sir! Is that Chef?

09:35.116 --> 09:37.994
No, no, no, no!
Don't, don't tell
Stevo I'm here.

09:38.077 --> 09:40.079
All right, Chef?

09:40.162 --> 09:43.249
You all right, Stevo?
How's the stock lookin'?

09:43.332 --> 09:45.251
Aww, shite.

09:45.334 --> 09:48.004
Yeah? D'ya roast off the bones?
Give it some good color?

09:48.087 --> 09:50.881
-Yeah.
-Got some nice
aromatics in there?

09:50.965 --> 09:51.799
Yeah.

09:51.882 --> 09:53.384
Well, then you're golden.

09:53.467 --> 09:54.677
You've got this, kid.

09:54.760 --> 09:57.179
You ready for
a party tomorrow, Chef?

09:57.263 --> 09:58.681
Lock-in at the restaurant.

09:58.764 --> 10:02.852
21 is gonna be epic, boooys!

10:02.935 --> 10:05.187
I'm not tellin' him.

10:05.271 --> 10:07.023
I'm not gonna
make it, Stevo.

10:07.106 --> 10:08.149
What?

10:08.232 --> 10:10.401
I've gotta go away
and get my head straight.

10:10.484 --> 10:12.236
Well, can't you get
fucked up with us

10:12.320 --> 10:14.071
and then get
your head straight?

10:14.155 --> 10:16.949
We'll get messy soon,
all right? Promise.

10:20.453 --> 10:22.288
-Oi.
-Oi, oi.

10:25.333 --> 10:27.001
D'ya know Rita's pregnant?

10:28.085 --> 10:29.920
It was only a matter
of time, wasn't it?

10:30.004 --> 10:31.380
Once Mags had hers.

10:34.842 --> 10:36.385
Oi...

10:36.469 --> 10:39.138
Good luck with your... head.

10:39.221 --> 10:41.098
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

11:03.287 --> 11:05.164
-All right, Dad?
-Dad
Hello, pet.

11:05.247 --> 11:06.707
I'm not gonna do
your big shop tomorrow

11:06.791 --> 11:09.585
-'cause I'm out of town
for the weekend.
-No drama.

11:09.668 --> 11:11.253
You got those pills
in the freezer, yeah?

11:11.337 --> 11:13.506
I have. You gonna
watch the cricket?

11:13.589 --> 11:16.342
-No, I'm not gonna
watch the cricket.
-All right, all right.

11:16.425 --> 11:18.969
-Text me the score, yeah?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

11:19.053 --> 11:20.721
Okay, if you need
anything, call me.

11:20.805 --> 11:23.349
Don't worry about me.
You just have a nice time.

11:23.432 --> 11:25.559
-Love ya.
-Love you, too.

11:37.697 --> 11:43.035
What... a cruddy shithole.

11:59.844 --> 12:00.970
Ahh!

12:03.013 --> 12:04.098
Fuck!

12:09.437 --> 12:12.398
-Where's the bed?
-Sofa-bed.

12:13.524 --> 12:15.067
Is this your house?

12:16.360 --> 12:17.445
My friend's.

12:28.164 --> 12:29.248
No smoking.

12:35.963 --> 12:37.298
Enjoy your stay.

12:39.383 --> 12:41.343
Narrator
Archeologists now believe

12:41.427 --> 12:43.345
that Machu Picchu
was a royal estate

12:43.429 --> 12:45.389
for Incan nobles.

12:45.473 --> 12:48.142
Others argue that
it was a religious site,

12:48.225 --> 12:50.227
nestled deep
in the mountains

12:50.311 --> 12:52.021
and surrounded
by other...

12:52.104 --> 12:54.774
Dick... dick.

12:56.233 --> 12:57.985
Dick, dick.

12:58.777 --> 13:00.946
Diiick.

13:01.030 --> 13:04.867
Why you wanna be like
all these dicks, dude?

13:04.950 --> 13:08.370
...conquest of the mighty
pre-Columbian civilization

13:08.454 --> 13:09.663
of the 16th century.

13:09.747 --> 13:11.040
Oh, Rita.

13:12.708 --> 13:15.961
No, no, no.
No one wants to see that.

13:16.045 --> 13:18.339
...to be inspired creatively

13:18.422 --> 13:19.882
and spiritually by the...

13:19.965 --> 13:21.091
Fuck you, man.

13:21.175 --> 13:22.885
...the world's
most spectacular

13:22.968 --> 13:24.595
human-made wonders.

13:36.607 --> 13:37.525
Eh, uh!

13:38.984 --> 13:40.319
Didn't see you there.

13:43.781 --> 13:44.782
Mm-mm?

13:54.333 --> 13:58.003
Do you ever feel like
you're at a party where you
don't speak the language?

14:06.428 --> 14:07.930
Fuck!

14:49.680 --> 14:51.890
Can I have a glass
of water, please?

14:52.891 --> 14:54.435
Got the shakes, ha.

15:22.338 --> 15:24.632
Thanks. Ooh. Cheers.

15:34.058 --> 15:37.144
-It's the adrenaline.

15:41.732 --> 15:43.567
-Sorry.

15:44.568 --> 15:46.779
-Uck.
-It's all that adrenaline.

16:02.503 --> 16:04.922
So, what happens now?

16:07.257 --> 16:08.842
You don't know, do you?

16:10.219 --> 16:11.470
Okay.

16:11.553 --> 16:13.972
Well, I want to go home.

16:14.515 --> 16:15.432
Yeah?

16:22.356 --> 16:23.315
Good luck.

17:23.167 --> 17:26.128
Fucking hell!

17:27.671 --> 17:28.756
Ah!

17:44.730 --> 17:50.194
No way am I stayin' put
with three dead bodies
and a creepy baby.

17:50.277 --> 17:54.031
Well, of course the fucking
baby's with me! Fuck!

17:54.114 --> 17:55.866
I'm not a monster!

17:58.243 --> 18:01.705
Well, I don't know
why it's creepy.

18:01.789 --> 18:03.749
It's just got a creepy vibe.

18:05.626 --> 18:07.878
Well, tell me where
the nearest station is.

18:11.006 --> 18:12.549
I'll be there in an hour.

18:26.271 --> 18:28.023
-Oh sh...

18:51.922 --> 18:52.840
Hm.

19:26.123 --> 19:30.085
I'm going to take a piss, yeah?
I'll be back in a minute.

19:52.149 --> 19:53.567
Could I use your toilet, please?

19:53.650 --> 19:55.777
Yes, pet, through there.

20:00.574 --> 20:02.075
Can I leave this with you?

20:02.159 --> 20:04.453
Yeah, of course, pet, yeah.

20:08.957 --> 20:10.042
Hello!

20:11.084 --> 20:13.128
Pleasure to meet you.

20:14.296 --> 20:15.964
Oh, hard work, isn't it?

20:16.048 --> 20:18.133
This your first?

20:18.216 --> 20:21.261
-Uh--
-Yeah. Not even
the best bit, you know?

20:21.929 --> 20:24.222
-No?
-No.

20:24.306 --> 20:27.643
You wait till their
little personality
starts to come through.

20:27.726 --> 20:30.896
Aw, it's like...
falling in love.

20:32.064 --> 20:34.232
You go and have
five minutes for yourself.

20:34.316 --> 20:35.442
Go on.

20:35.525 --> 20:38.403
We'll be just fine,
won't we? Yes.

20:38.487 --> 20:41.114
Yeah. Ooh.

20:58.757 --> 21:04.471
Ooh-woo-woo-woo-woo.
Ooh-woo. Yes. Ah!

21:07.099 --> 21:09.601
-Yes.

21:09.685 --> 21:12.270
Yes, I know. Yes.

22:10.078 --> 22:11.538
Fuck off.

23:22.359 --> 23:23.443
Hello?

23:46.842 --> 23:47.968
-They're here.

23:48.051 --> 23:50.637
Oh, no.
I'm just droppin' it off.

23:50.720 --> 23:51.638
Ta-ra!

23:53.181 --> 23:55.267
Officer Wren,
take the baby
to the medical room

23:55.350 --> 23:59.646
and get
Social Services
here ASAP.

23:59.729 --> 24:02.482
Officer
Sarge, we got an ID
on yellow duffel jacket.

24:02.566 --> 24:03.817
Sergeant
Oh yeah?

24:03.900 --> 24:05.902
Officer
Lydia McNaish-Wilcox.

24:05.986 --> 24:09.781
Sergeant
Lydia McNaish-Wilcox.
That's quite a mouthful.

24:09.865 --> 24:11.992
See if you can track
down her relatives,

24:12.075 --> 24:15.912
and let me know when
the garage CCTV comes in.

24:30.969 --> 24:32.220
Is this coffee?

24:32.679 --> 24:33.930
Yes.

24:34.014 --> 24:35.348
Got any sugar?

24:36.766 --> 24:38.977
I'd like to go over
your statement.

24:40.520 --> 24:41.897
Third time's the charm.

24:41.980 --> 24:44.065
Just wanna make sure
I've got it down right:

24:44.149 --> 24:46.860
"The woman fell
from the cliff...

24:46.943 --> 24:50.113
"followed by the baby
about 10 seconds later,

24:50.197 --> 24:52.532
which I caught like this."

24:55.952 --> 24:57.245
Is that correct?

24:59.122 --> 25:01.833
"I had never seen a baby
before in my life."

25:01.917 --> 25:03.585
-"After hearing--"
-"The."

25:03.668 --> 25:05.670
-Excuse me?
-Never seen "the" baby before.

25:05.754 --> 25:07.923
I've seen "a" baby before.

25:11.885 --> 25:12.802
"After hearing the crash,

25:12.886 --> 25:16.014
"I went outside
and found the two officers

25:16.097 --> 25:17.557
"dead in the car.

25:17.641 --> 25:19.976
A boulder had
fallen on them."

25:23.146 --> 25:28.026
A short while later,
you saw a man killed
by a falling shelf.

25:32.739 --> 25:36.368
Two police officers
are dead, Natasha.

25:36.451 --> 25:39.746
And you think I crushed 'em
to death with a boulder?

25:39.829 --> 25:42.832
I think there's something
you're not telling me.

25:45.335 --> 25:48.588
I think you've had
a terrible time tonight.

25:48.672 --> 25:52.467
Four dead bodies...
That's a lot.

25:54.719 --> 25:56.680
What do you
think's going on?

26:02.519 --> 26:04.604
We'd like to keep
you in overnight.

26:04.688 --> 26:07.023
-Are you jokin'?
-Right now, we're just
followin' the evidence.

26:07.107 --> 26:10.110
-What power are you
tryin' to arrest me under?
-We're detaining you

26:10.193 --> 26:13.697
-under Section 136
for your safety...
-You think I'm mad?

26:13.780 --> 26:15.699
-...and that of others.
-I was just tryin'
to do the right thi--

26:28.044 --> 26:31.464
-The baby won't stop crying.
-Not my problem.

27:04.622 --> 27:06.666
Sorry, pal, no can do.

27:12.797 --> 27:14.299
Fuck off.

27:39.407 --> 27:44.537
Well, this is incredibly weird.

27:46.664 --> 27:48.792
Easy there, tiger.

27:52.712 --> 27:53.630
Ah!

28:02.472 --> 28:04.933
Sergeant
Your story checks out.

28:05.016 --> 28:06.351
You can go.

28:19.697 --> 28:21.783
One second.

28:21.866 --> 28:25.245
Aren't you
forgetting something?

28:25.328 --> 28:28.498
-Not mine.
-What am I supposed
to do with it?

28:28.581 --> 28:30.041
I can think of something.
