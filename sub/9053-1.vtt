00:31.000 --> 00:32.000
Oh-ooh!

00:37.120 --> 00:38.235
Stairs.

00:39.560 --> 00:41.630
I don't think I can...

00:41.720 --> 00:44.280
You guys,
just start without me.

00:46.120 --> 00:47.792
I'll catch up!

00:57.080 --> 00:58.832
Sweet.

01:00.480 --> 01:01.480
Ah.

01:17.360 --> 01:22.593
Inner peace.

01:24.880 --> 01:26.836
Itchy nose.

01:33.200 --> 01:36.317
Finally, inner peace.

01:37.360 --> 01:38.360
Now what?

01:50.520 --> 01:52.590
Kai, old friend.

01:54.120 --> 01:56.588
Master Oogway.

01:56.800 --> 01:59.917
Our battle ended
500 years ago!

02:00.320 --> 02:02.675
Well, now I'm ready
for a rematch.

02:02.840 --> 02:04.876
Took you long enough!

02:20.720 --> 02:22.756
You've grown stronger.

02:28.120 --> 02:32.830
500 years in the Spirit Realm,
you pick up a thing or two.

02:33.040 --> 02:36.919
I have taken the chi
of every master here.

02:37.360 --> 02:38.360
No!

02:38.440 --> 02:39.440
Yes.

02:39.520 --> 02:42.318
And soon I will have
your power, too.

02:42.480 --> 02:44.391
When will you realize?

02:44.480 --> 02:46.914
The more you take,
the less you have.

03:07.880 --> 03:09.029
With your chi,

03:09.120 --> 03:12.715
I will finally be able
to return to the mortal world.

03:12.920 --> 03:16.913
And this time,
you won't be there to stop me.

03:18.080 --> 03:20.753
It was never my destiny
to stop you.

03:20.920 --> 03:23.992
I have set another
on that path.

03:29.320 --> 03:31.276
Then I will find him,

03:31.480 --> 03:34.040
and take his chi, too.

03:51.280 --> 03:55.239
Justice is about to be served!

04:03.480 --> 04:05.755
Whoo-hoo!

04:16.720 --> 04:18.072
Yee-haw!

04:50.360 --> 04:52.078
We'll have two Justice Platters,
please.

04:52.160 --> 04:53.160
Um... Three.
Three.

04:53.240 --> 04:54.240
And a few tofu buns.

04:54.320 --> 04:55.469
Oh, the spicy noodle
soup for Tigress.

04:55.560 --> 04:56.754
Did you want extra
sauce with that?

04:56.840 --> 04:57.840
She wants it
on the side.

04:57.920 --> 04:59.558
On the side.
On the side.

05:00.720 --> 05:02.312
Go, Dragon
Warrior! You can do it!

05:02.480 --> 05:03.515
Go, Dragon Warrior!

05:03.600 --> 05:04.715
Defend the Valley!

05:04.880 --> 05:06.199
Dragon Warrior!

05:08.920 --> 05:10.512
Go, Dragon Warrior!

05:10.680 --> 05:12.511
Defend the Valley!

05:14.280 --> 05:16.350
Yee-haw!

05:17.120 --> 05:19.190
You guys aren't doing
the Dramatic Pose, are you?

05:19.360 --> 05:21.590
Do we have to strike a pose
every time we land?

05:21.960 --> 05:23.598
You guys, never underestimate

05:23.680 --> 05:25.159
the power
of a Dramatic Entrance.

05:25.320 --> 05:26.912
I've heard about some masters
who can win a fight

05:27.000 --> 05:28.672
just by throwing open a door.

05:30.040 --> 05:31.314
Oh!

05:31.400 --> 05:32.628
Dramatic Entrance?

05:32.920 --> 05:33.920
Master Shifu.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.831
The Dragon Warrior is correct.

05:36.000 --> 05:37.513
Really? I was just making...

05:37.680 --> 05:39.716
Uh, yeah. I mean, yeah. I am.

05:39.880 --> 05:42.792
Before the battle of the fist
comes the battle of the mind.

05:42.960 --> 05:45.520
Hence, the Dramatic Entrance.

05:56.680 --> 05:57.749
Oh!

05:57.840 --> 06:00.877
Nice Dramatic Entrance.
What's the occasion?

06:01.040 --> 06:03.713
Today will be
my final class.

06:03.920 --> 06:05.399
Your final... Wait.

06:05.560 --> 06:07.039
I didn't even know
you were sick!

06:07.160 --> 06:09.230
Although you have been looking a little...
I'm not sick.

06:09.320 --> 06:11.390
...healthy.
A little healthy. A lot, actually.

06:11.520 --> 06:14.990
My final class,
because from now on,

06:15.160 --> 06:17.310
your training will be
in the hands

06:17.400 --> 06:19.152
of the Dragon Warrior.

06:21.160 --> 06:22.160
What?

06:25.040 --> 06:26.871
Me, teach?
I mean, why not, Tigress?

06:26.960 --> 06:28.234
She's always telling
everyone what to do.

06:28.320 --> 06:29.320
Be quiet, Po.

06:29.400 --> 06:30.549
You see what I mean?

06:30.720 --> 06:32.312
Tigress is not
the Dragon Warrior.

06:32.800 --> 06:33.800
You are.

06:33.880 --> 06:35.438
Come on,
they're the Five.

06:35.520 --> 06:37.158
What could I teach them?

06:37.320 --> 06:40.949
There is always something more
to learn, even for a master.

06:41.200 --> 06:42.235
For instance,

06:42.320 --> 06:44.436
let me show you
another move,

06:44.960 --> 06:46.916
the Dramatic Exit.

06:47.640 --> 06:49.232
What's that?

06:50.760 --> 06:52.637
Wow! Are you kidding me?

06:53.800 --> 06:55.756
Where'd he go?

06:56.680 --> 06:57.680
Master.

06:58.920 --> 07:00.797
He's gone, guys.
It's cool.

07:00.960 --> 07:03.235
We await your
instruction, Master.

07:03.440 --> 07:06.113
All you have to lose
is our respect.

07:09.480 --> 07:12.278
I mean, seriously,
how bad can it be?

07:12.360 --> 07:14.316
Very bad!
Very, very bad!

07:14.400 --> 07:16.277
Okay, okay.
Let's switch it up.

07:16.440 --> 07:18.237
Monkey!
Immovable Mountain Stance!

07:18.400 --> 07:19.594
Yes, Master!

07:21.000 --> 07:23.036
Tigress,
Tornado Back Flip!

07:23.200 --> 07:24.235
Yes, Master.

07:26.000 --> 07:27.319
Oh, no! Fire!

07:27.400 --> 07:28.400
- Fire!
- Stop!

07:28.480 --> 07:30.118
Sorry! My fault.

07:30.760 --> 07:32.557
Crane, go high.
I mean low! Low!

07:33.800 --> 07:35.153
Ah, my claw thingy!

07:35.280 --> 07:36.918
Uh, Viper and Tigress, do,

07:37.000 --> 07:39.992
uh, like, a Totem Pole
Poison Technique!

07:40.080 --> 07:43.231
Uh, you two,
do a Swarming Insect Bite

07:43.440 --> 07:46.671
with a Yellow Tail,
Yellow Jacket, Spicy Tuna...

07:46.840 --> 07:48.193
I'm sorry.

07:53.480 --> 07:55.789
Good job, Po.

07:57.280 --> 07:58.280
Ah!

07:58.560 --> 08:00.755
Did you at least learn
a little something?

08:00.920 --> 08:01.989
Yes.

08:02.160 --> 08:03.798
That you can't teach.

08:03.960 --> 08:06.235
And Tigress is flammable,
it turns out.

08:13.360 --> 08:15.874
Yeah, that was
a complete disaster.

08:16.040 --> 08:17.917
Uh, I'm glad
we're not Po right now.

08:18.080 --> 08:19.115
What a loser!

08:19.320 --> 08:20.514
What was Shifu thinking?

08:20.680 --> 08:22.040
What was Oogway thinking?

08:25.640 --> 08:27.790
I think he heard us.

08:27.960 --> 08:29.632
I didn't hear
anything.

08:29.920 --> 08:31.717
Uh, he said
you're a loser.

08:44.240 --> 08:46.071
I'm sorry, Oogway.

08:48.440 --> 08:49.589
Would you stop
doing that?

08:49.760 --> 08:51.318
How was your
first day teaching?

08:51.480 --> 08:52.833
Humiliating.

08:52.920 --> 08:53.920
I heard.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.433
Who told you?
Did Tigress tell you?

08:55.600 --> 08:57.670
I heard from Monkey,
and Crane, and Mantis,

08:57.840 --> 09:00.912
and your dad,
and Mrs. Chao from the gift shop,

09:01.080 --> 09:02.672
and those ducks
you just passed,

09:03.280 --> 09:04.280
and Tigress told me.

09:04.400 --> 09:06.277
Yeah, well, did she also tell you
that it'll never happen again?

09:06.360 --> 09:07.429
Because I'm done.

09:07.520 --> 09:09.590
Teaching or being humiliated?

09:09.760 --> 09:12.513
Both! I don't know why you ever
thought I could teach that class.

09:12.840 --> 09:14.319
Oh, I knew you couldn't.

09:14.480 --> 09:17.438
What? You set me
up to fail? Why?

09:17.600 --> 09:19.556
If you only do
what you can do,

09:19.640 --> 09:22.393
you will never be
more than you are now.

09:22.840 --> 09:25.308
I don't wanna be more!
I like who I am.

09:25.480 --> 09:28.153
You don't even know
who you are.

09:28.320 --> 09:29.719
What do you...
Of course I do.

09:29.800 --> 09:31.438
I'm the Dragon Warrior.

09:31.600 --> 09:34.353
And what exactly does
that mean, Dragon Warrior?

09:36.760 --> 09:37.795
Hmm.

09:37.880 --> 09:41.156
It means, you know,
just going around

09:41.240 --> 09:42.559
and punching and kicking.

09:42.720 --> 09:45.314
Defending the Valley!
And stuff.

09:45.520 --> 09:46.919
Punching and kicking?

09:47.080 --> 09:48.229
You think that is what

09:48.320 --> 09:50.356
the great Master Oogway
saw for you?

09:51.920 --> 09:54.309
A 500-year
prophecy fulfilled

09:54.400 --> 09:56.960
so you could spend
your days kicking butt

09:57.120 --> 09:59.839
and running through town
high-fiving bunnies?

10:00.360 --> 10:01.873
Yes?
No!

10:03.120 --> 10:05.634
Oogway saw greatness
in you, Po.

10:05.720 --> 10:07.711
Against my better judgment.

10:07.880 --> 10:10.678
More than you can see
in yourself.

10:10.880 --> 10:13.553
Incredible power awaits you.

10:14.960 --> 10:18.919
Power beyond anything
you can imagine.

10:34.560 --> 10:36.516
Wow! What was that?

10:36.680 --> 10:37.954
That was chi.

10:38.120 --> 10:39.314
Wow!

10:39.800 --> 10:40.800
What's chi?

10:40.960 --> 10:45.636
The energy that flows
through all living things.

10:45.800 --> 10:47.870
So you're saying
if I teach,

10:48.000 --> 10:49.194
I'll be able to do
cool stuff like that?

10:49.360 --> 10:51.476
No. I'm saying
if you teach,

10:51.560 --> 10:53.471
I'll be able to do
cool stuff like that.

10:53.560 --> 10:54.560
Oh.

10:54.640 --> 10:58.155
Mastering chi requires
mastery of self.

10:58.320 --> 11:00.197
Oogway sat alone in a cave

11:00.280 --> 11:03.955
for 30 years
asking one question.

11:04.400 --> 11:05.913
"Who am I?"

11:06.360 --> 11:07.839
"Who am I?"

11:08.000 --> 11:09.752
I'm lucky if
I get five minutes

11:09.840 --> 11:11.200
before you interrupt...

11:11.360 --> 11:13.715
So now I have to sit alone
in a cave for 30 years?

11:13.840 --> 11:14.840
Eventually.

11:14.920 --> 11:16.512
After you master teaching.

11:16.680 --> 11:19.831
Teaching? There's no way
I'm ever gonna be like you.

11:20.000 --> 11:21.956
I'm not trying
to turn you into me.

11:22.160 --> 11:26.312
I'm trying to
turn you into you.

11:28.600 --> 11:31.273
Turn me into me?

11:31.360 --> 11:32.560
Wait a second,
that makes no...

11:32.720 --> 11:33.755
Almost there, Shifu.

11:34.000 --> 11:37.117
Just a little more confusing
and you'll be the next Oogway.

11:37.520 --> 11:39.033
Hmm... Oh! Uh...

11:39.120 --> 11:41.918
Sorry, no offense,
Master Oogway. I just...

11:43.120 --> 11:44.840
I'll let you get back
to your eternal peace.

12:26.200 --> 12:27.872
What is this place?

12:28.040 --> 12:29.917
Uh... My brother's farm?

12:30.280 --> 12:31.280
Ah.

12:31.800 --> 12:34.872
If I stepped on you,
would you die?

12:36.160 --> 12:37.160
Yes.

12:38.800 --> 12:40.756
The mortal realm.

12:41.440 --> 12:44.955
You hear that, Oogway?
I'm back.

12:45.680 --> 12:48.433
Kai has returned!

12:49.680 --> 12:50.715
Who?

12:51.120 --> 12:52.838
Kai. General Kai.

12:53.280 --> 12:56.158
Supreme Warlord of all China.

12:57.040 --> 12:58.075
Huh?

12:58.160 --> 13:01.391
The Jade Slayer.
Master of Pain.

13:01.960 --> 13:04.349
You may know me as
the Beast of Vengeance.

13:04.480 --> 13:06.277
Uh... Maker of Widows?

13:07.240 --> 13:08.240
Uh...

13:09.280 --> 13:10.998
Okay, I used to
work with Oogway.

13:11.160 --> 13:12.513
Oh, Master Oogway!

13:12.680 --> 13:13.669
Now, he was a great warrior.

13:13.800 --> 13:14.994
We've heard of
Master Oogway.

13:15.160 --> 13:17.276
Okay, okay,
enough. Silence!

13:25.320 --> 13:28.278
Find Oogway's students,
and bring them to me.

13:34.920 --> 13:37.992
By the time I am done
with them, Oogway,

13:38.160 --> 13:42.711
there will be no one left who
will even remember your name.

13:42.880 --> 13:46.793
Kai is coming!

13:49.640 --> 13:50.959
I am ready

13:52.280 --> 13:53.554
to teach you a lesson.

13:53.720 --> 13:56.029
Teach me? Oh, no!
It's the Dragon Teacher!

13:56.200 --> 13:57.633
Yeah, he's so handsome!

13:57.800 --> 13:58.960
Thank you for the compliment.

14:02.160 --> 14:03.991
No! Please don't
teach me to death!

14:05.240 --> 14:06.240
Po?

14:06.400 --> 14:08.311
Oh, hey, Dad.
What's up?

14:09.040 --> 14:13.079
I was just, uh,
stopping by for a little soak.

14:17.000 --> 14:18.069
Okay. What's wrong?

14:18.160 --> 14:19.160
Nothing.

14:19.240 --> 14:20.878
Nothing? I come home

14:20.960 --> 14:22.598
to find you taking
a bath with your dolls...

14:22.680 --> 14:23.680
Action figures.

14:23.800 --> 14:25.916
...and instead of adding
bath salts to the water,

14:26.000 --> 14:27.718
you just added
Szechuan peppercorns.

14:27.880 --> 14:28.880
Szechuan...

14:30.400 --> 14:32.197
Oh, oh, my tenders! Oh...

14:34.760 --> 14:36.079
Okay, yes,
something's wrong.

14:36.240 --> 14:37.389
There, there, son.

14:37.520 --> 14:39.272
You tell your daddy
all about it.

14:39.480 --> 14:40.595
Lift your arm.

14:40.760 --> 14:42.398
Shifu says I don't
know what it means

14:42.480 --> 14:43.879
to be the Dragon Warrior.

14:44.040 --> 14:46.190
Now I have to be a teacher?

14:46.400 --> 14:47.799
I thought I finally
knew who I was.

14:47.960 --> 14:50.190
If I'm not the Dragon Warrior,
then who am I?

14:50.360 --> 14:52.715
A teacher?
Teaching kung fu?

14:52.800 --> 14:54.870
Po, that's a promotion!

14:55.080 --> 14:56.195
Take the job, son!

14:56.360 --> 14:57.680
And, someday when
you're in charge

14:57.760 --> 14:58.795
of the whole Jade Palace,

14:59.000 --> 15:01.912
I can sell noodles
in the lobby!

15:02.520 --> 15:04.440
Why are you still here
taking a bath like a baby?

15:04.600 --> 15:05.635
Get out! Get up!

15:05.840 --> 15:08.798
Go, go, go!
Franchise expansion awaits us!

15:08.960 --> 15:11.040
But what about the Dragon
Warrior look-alike contest?

15:11.120 --> 15:12.838
Oh, Mrs. Chow
always wins that.

15:13.320 --> 15:14.799
Skadoosh.

15:14.960 --> 15:17.190
And the Dragon Warrior
dumpling-eating contest?

15:17.280 --> 15:18.349
I have to defend my title.

15:18.560 --> 15:21.120
No one's gonna beat your
dumpling-eating record.

15:21.280 --> 15:23.320
Someone's about to beat your
dumpling-eating record!

15:24.400 --> 15:26.311
Go! Go!

15:26.480 --> 15:27.799
Who's eating my dumplings?

15:27.960 --> 15:29.234
And who's paying
for them?

15:29.840 --> 15:32.229
101! 102!

15:39.240 --> 15:41.196
103!

15:47.880 --> 15:49.233
Yeah!

15:49.400 --> 15:50.833
Is that a new record?

15:51.240 --> 15:52.719
Who are you?

15:52.880 --> 15:54.871
I am Li Shan.

15:55.040 --> 15:56.040
What?

15:58.600 --> 16:00.716
I'm Li Shan.

16:00.880 --> 16:02.871
I'm looking for my son.

16:06.880 --> 16:08.199
You lost your son?

16:08.400 --> 16:09.594
Yes.

16:09.760 --> 16:11.876
Many years ago.

16:12.520 --> 16:14.033
I lost my father.

16:14.560 --> 16:16.198
I'm very sorry.

16:16.360 --> 16:18.555
Thank you.

16:20.400 --> 16:22.834
Well, good luck to you.

16:23.560 --> 16:24.913
You, too.

16:25.080 --> 16:26.752
I hope you find your son.

16:27.280 --> 16:29.589
And I hope you find
your father.

16:39.920 --> 16:41.592
Son?

16:41.800 --> 16:43.836
Oh, my gosh, it is you!

16:45.080 --> 16:47.435
Well, don't just stand there.
Give your old man a hug!

16:50.560 --> 16:52.596
I can't believe
you're alive!

16:57.160 --> 17:00.869
Oh, I thought I lost
you forever, Little Lotus.

17:00.960 --> 17:02.029
Uh...

17:02.120 --> 17:03.758
Okay. Uh, this is
very embarrassing,

17:03.960 --> 17:04.949
but I think you've
got me confused

17:05.079 --> 17:06.115
with a panda named Lotus.

17:06.280 --> 17:07.315
My name is Po.

17:07.480 --> 17:09.710
Oh, right,
you wouldn't know.

17:09.920 --> 17:11.672
Oh. Okay.
See, Little Lotus

17:11.800 --> 17:13.836
was the name you
were given at birth.

17:14.000 --> 17:15.433
Really?
Really!

17:15.599 --> 17:16.599
I can't believe it!

17:16.680 --> 17:18.477
After all these years,
you're really here?

17:18.680 --> 17:20.113
This is amazing!

17:20.280 --> 17:21.315
Oh, Dad!

17:21.440 --> 17:23.271
Come! Say hi to, um...

17:23.440 --> 17:25.907
I don't know what
I'm supposed to call you.

17:26.079 --> 17:27.911
I'm pretty sure
he said his name is Li.

17:28.079 --> 17:29.798
You.

17:29.960 --> 17:31.439
Come here.

17:31.520 --> 17:32.714
Oh...

17:32.800 --> 17:34.358
Thank you, thank you

17:34.480 --> 17:36.755
for taking such
good care of my son.

17:36.920 --> 17:40.117
Your son?
Now, hold on just a minute.

17:40.280 --> 17:43.989
How do we know this stranger
is even related to you?

17:44.160 --> 17:45.479
Look at that.

17:45.640 --> 17:47.949
Our bellies could be brothers!
That is so cool.

17:48.120 --> 17:49.951
Hey, son, let me teach you
how to belly gong.

17:50.120 --> 17:52.000
- All right. Belly gong.
- They jiggle the same!

17:54.000 --> 17:55.877
It's like looking
in a fat mirror.

17:58.000 --> 18:00.389
I can't believe we're
taking a picture together.

18:02.000 --> 18:03.149
Huh?

18:04.560 --> 18:06.471
But I still
don't understand.

18:06.640 --> 18:08.551
I thought Po
was the only panda left.

18:08.720 --> 18:11.518
No.
There's a whole bunch of us.

18:11.680 --> 18:12.999
Where?

18:13.160 --> 18:15.469
A secret panda
village in the mountains.

18:15.640 --> 18:16.709
A secret panda...

18:16.840 --> 18:18.751
Whoa.

18:18.840 --> 18:20.478
But how did you know
where I was?

18:20.640 --> 18:23.473
I received a message
that led me here.

18:23.640 --> 18:25.392
How could you
receive a message

18:25.520 --> 18:27.829
if no one
could find you?

18:28.040 --> 18:29.268
Sounds suspicious to me.

18:29.360 --> 18:30.360
Hmm?

18:30.480 --> 18:32.994
No, it was a message
from the universe.

18:33.080 --> 18:34.195
Whoa!
Whoa.

18:34.320 --> 18:35.320
Rats!

18:35.360 --> 18:38.557
Now, what's all
this about a Dragon Warrior?

18:38.760 --> 18:40.637
How did you know
I was a Dragon Warrior?

18:40.720 --> 18:42.312
Did the universe
tell you that, too?

18:43.600 --> 18:44.669
No, the poster did.

18:44.840 --> 18:45.875
And the gift shop.

18:46.320 --> 18:47.673
I bought a tiny cup.

18:47.840 --> 18:50.434
Oh, right, of course!

18:50.560 --> 18:53.438
You have no idea.
There's so much to show you.

18:53.600 --> 18:54.960
You're gonna be
so awesomely proud.

18:55.040 --> 18:56.758
Come on, come on!

18:58.560 --> 19:01.358
I'm already
awesomely proud.

19:04.760 --> 19:06.716
- Couple more steps.
- Give me a minute.

19:06.880 --> 19:08.280
Feeling the burn.

19:08.760 --> 19:10.955
Do you have
panda asthma, too?

19:11.120 --> 19:12.792
Does that run
in the family?

19:12.920 --> 19:15.514
Dad, you're
gonna love this.

19:15.680 --> 19:17.398
It's, like,
the coolest thing ever.

19:18.400 --> 19:20.914
This is the Hall of Heroes.

19:21.080 --> 19:22.229
Home of the most priceless

19:22.360 --> 19:23.918
kung fu artifacts
in all of China!

19:24.080 --> 19:27.038
Whoa! This place is...

19:27.200 --> 19:28.360
Awesome?
Were you gonna say...

19:28.560 --> 19:30.312
You were gonna say "awesome,"
right? Because it totally is!

19:30.400 --> 19:32.516
Totally!
But be super careful.

19:32.600 --> 19:33.635
Everything's very
fragile here.

19:33.760 --> 19:35.512
Like the Urn
of Whispering Warriors.

19:35.600 --> 19:37.113
Someone broke that once.

19:37.320 --> 19:38.799
Who?
Some idiot.

19:38.960 --> 19:40.473
Wow!

19:40.560 --> 19:42.596
This is Master Flying
Rhino's battle armor!

19:42.760 --> 19:45.115
I wonder if
I could fit in that.

19:45.280 --> 19:47.475
Get out of my head, Dad!
I've wondered the same thing!

19:47.640 --> 19:48.640
If I could fit in it?

19:48.800 --> 19:50.199
If you could?
No, if I could fit.

19:50.280 --> 19:52.077
Oh.
Dad, check it out!

19:52.640 --> 19:54.995
Master Ram's crossbow,
the infamous Gate Smasher.

19:55.160 --> 19:56.160
Dad, look at this!

19:56.320 --> 19:57.912
The battle helmets
of Master Rat's army.

19:58.000 --> 19:59.319
They're so tiny!

19:59.840 --> 20:01.512
Master Dolphin's
waterproof armor!

20:01.600 --> 20:02.749
This is my favorite.

20:02.920 --> 20:04.353
Check it out.
It's the legendary

20:04.440 --> 20:05.953
battle rickshaw
of Emperor Hawk.

20:07.400 --> 20:08.913
Sweet ride.

20:10.240 --> 20:11.240
Dad, what are
you doing?

20:11.280 --> 20:12.720
We're not supposed
to touch anything!

20:12.800 --> 20:15.473
Oh, sorry, sorry.
Should I put it back?

20:15.640 --> 20:17.358
Yeah, you probably should.

20:17.520 --> 20:19.476
You look so cool, though.

20:19.600 --> 20:21.079
How does it feel?

20:21.280 --> 20:23.430
Do the hinges hinge?
Does it smell like rhino?

20:23.600 --> 20:25.272
Does it feel like
you're impenetrable?

20:25.440 --> 20:27.640
Does it feel like you could
take on a thousand warriors,

20:27.760 --> 20:30.320
and emerge unscathed?

20:30.640 --> 20:33.313
Yeah, it's pretty cool.

20:33.640 --> 20:34.640
Ooh!

20:34.760 --> 20:36.751
I wonder what this does.
I should pull it.

20:47.120 --> 20:48.712
I think I just peed a little.

20:50.800 --> 20:54.315
Anything else
we should try in here, son?

20:54.800 --> 20:55.800
Hmm?

21:00.360 --> 21:02.669
Charge!

21:03.160 --> 21:05.310
Faster, faster, faster!

21:05.480 --> 21:06.674
Thumb war!

21:06.840 --> 21:08.193
Reinforcements!
Ooh. Ooh.

21:08.360 --> 21:09.918
No fair. No fair.

21:11.360 --> 21:12.360
Yeah!

21:13.160 --> 21:14.832
This is so much fu...

21:17.560 --> 21:18.879
Here we go! Go, go, go!

21:19.040 --> 21:20.678
Awesome!
Faster, faster, faster.

21:20.920 --> 21:22.353
There, there.

21:22.520 --> 21:23.919
I'm fine, I'm fine.

21:24.320 --> 21:25.514
There you go.

21:25.720 --> 21:27.756
Dolphin-Style Attack!

21:27.880 --> 21:30.075
You got me.
Dolphin-Style Retreat!

21:31.600 --> 21:33.158
Go long, son!

21:34.320 --> 21:35.320
Whoa!

21:35.400 --> 21:37.391
I wasn't ready!

21:37.520 --> 21:39.192
Coming back at you.
I got it.

21:39.400 --> 21:40.753
I'm going high!
There you go.

21:40.880 --> 21:41.920
Come on, throw it!

21:43.040 --> 21:44.553
I'm coming for you.

21:45.160 --> 21:46.559
Bring it on, Master Rhino.

21:46.680 --> 21:47.680
Here I come!

21:51.560 --> 21:52.560
Oh!

21:56.680 --> 21:59.717
I'm gonna get you.
I am gonna get you!

21:59.920 --> 22:01.990
I'm gonna get you,
I'm gonna get you!

22:02.080 --> 22:03.672
Psst. Psst. Psst
I'm gonna get you.

22:03.880 --> 22:05.950
Who's got you?
Who's gonna get you?

22:06.120 --> 22:08.918
Who's gonna get you?
Yeah. Who's gonna get you?

22:11.360 --> 22:12.793
Master Rhino.

22:13.120 --> 22:15.111
What? What's wrong?

22:20.920 --> 22:22.433
Hello.

22:23.040 --> 22:24.040
Guys, guys.

22:24.200 --> 22:26.236
You're never gonna guess
who just showed up.

22:26.320 --> 22:28.197
Not in a million years.

22:28.280 --> 22:29.280
You just try.

22:29.440 --> 22:30.714
Your father!

22:30.880 --> 22:32.472
Whoa! How did you
just guess that?

22:32.640 --> 22:33.629
Oh, wait a second.
Oh, yeah, of course.

22:33.760 --> 22:34.760
We look exactly the same.

22:34.920 --> 22:36.638
Dad, say hi
to my friends.

22:36.800 --> 22:40.110
Mantis, Tigress,
Monkey, Crane, and Viper.

22:40.200 --> 22:41.315
Oh, Viper, was it?

22:41.400 --> 22:42.400
Monkey, sir.

22:42.440 --> 22:44.795
They're kind of my best friends.
And this...

22:44.960 --> 22:47.110
This is Master Shifu. Legend.

22:47.280 --> 22:50.431
Uh... It is an honor
to meet you, Master Panda.

22:50.600 --> 22:52.431
Perhaps your father
would care to join us

22:52.600 --> 22:53.635
in the training hall.

22:53.800 --> 22:55.677
Your son will be
teaching the class.

22:57.120 --> 22:58.473
Oh, ho, ho!
I'm sure he's tired.

22:58.640 --> 23:00.437
I'm sure you're tired.
He's tired.

23:00.600 --> 23:01.794
I'm gonna show him
to the Chrysanthemum Suite.

23:01.960 --> 23:03.871
What, tired?
No, I'm fine.

23:03.960 --> 23:05.439
I would love
to watch you teach.

23:05.600 --> 23:06.953
Trust me, it'll be more
fun just to watch me...

23:07.080 --> 23:08.638
Fight!

23:08.800 --> 23:09.800
What is that?

23:09.960 --> 23:11.359
The Valley's under attack.

23:12.480 --> 23:14.198
Son? Under attack?

23:14.360 --> 23:15.360
This is perfect!

23:15.520 --> 23:18.034
Now you can see what being the
Dragon Warrior's all about!

23:18.200 --> 23:19.200
Follow me!

23:26.480 --> 23:29.950
Enemies of justice,
prepare for war!

23:30.120 --> 23:31.678
Are you kidding me? Whoa!

23:34.200 --> 23:35.315
Ow!

23:40.360 --> 23:41.952
What's the deal
with the green guys?

23:42.480 --> 23:44.948
Some kind of jade zombies.

23:45.120 --> 23:46.553
Jade zombies?

23:46.720 --> 23:48.312
Jombies! Jinx!

23:48.400 --> 23:49.400
Ow!

23:49.520 --> 23:50.873
Lotus, be careful!

23:51.040 --> 23:53.474
It's okay, Dad,
I do this every day!

23:55.720 --> 23:57.358
Whoa! I recognize
these guys.

23:57.520 --> 23:58.873
The Master Badger Twins,

23:59.040 --> 24:00.712
with their Crushing
Double-Gong technique!

24:00.840 --> 24:01.875
Ow!

24:02.040 --> 24:03.678
Yeah, that's the one!

24:03.840 --> 24:04.955
And that guy is...

24:05.040 --> 24:07.031
No! Master Porcupine!

24:10.520 --> 24:12.351
I thought he died
a hundred years ago.

24:12.520 --> 24:14.317
These guys are legend!

24:14.720 --> 24:16.711
Get a quick sketch of us.

24:23.880 --> 24:25.233
Did you get it?
Did you get it?

24:25.560 --> 24:27.039
Oh, I blinked.

24:27.560 --> 24:28.800
Can we get another one?

24:31.360 --> 24:33.669
I'm being choked
by Master Porcupine.

24:33.760 --> 24:34.829
This is so cool.

24:35.760 --> 24:37.398
Oh! Oh, look. It's you!

24:37.560 --> 24:39.278
Po, focus!

24:39.600 --> 24:41.079
"Message from the universe."

24:41.200 --> 24:43.555
I'll give you a message
from the universe.

24:43.720 --> 24:45.073
Stay away from my son!

24:46.360 --> 24:47.600
Sorry, Dad.
I'll clean up later.

24:47.680 --> 24:49.193
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Not my good pan!

24:49.280 --> 24:50.395
Uh, take this one.

24:52.880 --> 24:54.074
Lotus! Watch out!

24:57.080 --> 24:58.080
Whoa!

24:59.600 --> 25:01.192
Dad, check out
my Dumplings of Doom.

25:12.760 --> 25:13.760
Gotcha.

25:18.640 --> 25:20.153
I see you.

25:20.880 --> 25:23.474
<i>Your chi will soon be mine.</i>

25:23.640 --> 25:24.675
Is he talking to me?
Which one?

25:24.760 --> 25:25.795
They're all talking.

25:25.960 --> 25:28.110
Whoa, you're right.
That's so scary.

25:28.280 --> 25:30.271
We should try that, too.
Maybe it'd be scary back at them.

25:30.440 --> 25:31.953
Okay, but we gotta plan
what we're gonna say first.

25:32.120 --> 25:33.633
Otherwise, it won't be scary.
It'll just be stupid.

25:33.840 --> 25:36.149
<i>It's not them talking,
you idiots!</i>

25:36.320 --> 25:37.833
<i>It's me talking
through them. Kai!</i>

25:38.280 --> 25:39.280
Who?

25:39.440 --> 25:41.431
Okay, okay, okay. Enough.

25:47.600 --> 25:49.040
Did you see that?
What just happened?

25:49.120 --> 25:51.509
The green smoke, just poof!
And then poof!

25:51.680 --> 25:53.159
Shifu, what was that?

25:53.360 --> 25:56.318
Kai... Kai... Kai...

25:56.680 --> 25:58.318
Nope, never heard of him.

25:58.760 --> 26:00.273
Kai... Kai...

26:00.800 --> 26:01.800
Where is it?

26:01.920 --> 26:04.040
There's so much wisdom in here,
I can't find anything.

26:04.160 --> 26:05.195
Yes!

26:06.480 --> 26:08.198
Behold.

26:09.160 --> 26:11.754
All the answers
will be found within.

26:13.960 --> 26:16.110
What? It's blank?

26:16.880 --> 26:19.633
Are you kidding me?
Not again.

26:21.160 --> 26:23.037
Wait, wait, hold on. Sorry.

26:23.200 --> 26:25.634
Oh, okay. Here we go.

26:26.320 --> 26:28.880
It is written
in Oogway's hand.

26:29.040 --> 26:31.395
"Long ago, I had a brother..."

26:31.520 --> 26:32.953
Oogway had a brother?

26:33.120 --> 26:36.476
"In arms. In arms." Sorry.
He says, "Brother-in-arms."

26:36.640 --> 26:38.471
Maybe you should just
unroll it all at once?

26:40.680 --> 26:44.070
"I was an ambitious young
warrior leading a great army."

26:46.200 --> 26:48.839
<i>And fighting
by my side was Kai,</i>

26:50.040 --> 26:51.996
<i>my closest friend.</i>

26:54.880 --> 26:57.758
<i>One day, we were ambushed.</i>

26:57.920 --> 26:59.876
<i>I was badly wounded.</i>

27:00.040 --> 27:04.352
<i>My friend carried me for days,
looking for help,</i>

27:04.880 --> 27:07.553
<i>until we came
to a secret village,</i>

27:07.720 --> 27:09.676
<i>high in the mountains.</i>

27:09.840 --> 27:12.593
<i>An ancient place of healing.</i>

27:12.760 --> 27:15.638
<i>A village of pandas.</i>

27:15.720 --> 27:17.358
Pandas?

27:17.520 --> 27:19.511
<i>Yes, pandas.</i>

27:19.680 --> 27:23.673
<i>Pandas who used
the power of chi to heal me.</i>

27:27.240 --> 27:30.198
<i>They taught me
how to give chi.</i>

27:34.720 --> 27:39.430
<i>Oh, but Kai wanted
the power all to himself.</i>

27:40.760 --> 27:44.878
<i>He saw that what could be
given could also be taken.</i>

27:48.600 --> 27:50.909
<i>I had to stop him.</i>

27:55.600 --> 27:58.273
<i>Our battle shook the earth,</i>

27:58.440 --> 28:00.271
<i>until, finally,</i>

28:00.440 --> 28:03.750
<i>I banished Kai
to the Spirit Realm.</i>

28:03.920 --> 28:06.559
<i>Should he ever return
to the mortal realm,</i>

28:06.720 --> 28:10.918
<i>he can only be stopped
by a true master of chi.</i>

28:11.120 --> 28:12.633
"True master of chi"?

28:12.800 --> 28:13.800
Like you!

28:14.000 --> 28:15.718
Me? I can barely
make a flower bloom.

28:15.920 --> 28:18.434
I need at least
30 more years, and a cave.

28:18.600 --> 28:19.720
We need a chi master.

28:19.840 --> 28:21.512
He will
continue stealing

28:21.600 --> 28:23.480
the chi of masters
until he has consumed it all.

28:23.600 --> 28:24.828
We have to think
of a way to stop him!

28:25.000 --> 28:26.274
He'll get more
and more powerful

28:26.400 --> 28:27.958
with every master he defeats.

28:28.120 --> 28:29.600
There is
no choice. We fight.

28:29.640 --> 28:31.392
I can teach you, son.

28:32.640 --> 28:34.790
You can do this?

28:34.960 --> 28:37.793
Of course. I'm a panda.

28:38.320 --> 28:40.788
That must be why
the universe sent you here!

28:41.680 --> 28:43.591
Okay, so what do I
have to do?

28:43.760 --> 28:45.591
You have to
come home with me.

28:45.760 --> 28:46.760
What?

28:46.920 --> 28:48.319
To the secret village?

28:48.480 --> 28:49.480
Yes, son.

28:49.640 --> 28:53.030
You must rediscover
what it is to be a panda.

28:53.200 --> 28:55.395
You have to learn
to live like a panda,

28:55.480 --> 28:56.993
sleep like a panda,

28:57.160 --> 28:59.037
eat like a panda.

28:59.640 --> 29:02.234
Those 103 dumplings?

29:02.320 --> 29:04.276
I was just warming up.

29:04.440 --> 29:06.192
I've always felt like
I wasn't eating up

29:06.320 --> 29:07.673
to my full potential.

29:08.320 --> 29:10.834
No, you can't take Po
away from me. No, no.

29:11.000 --> 29:12.194
I want a second opinion.

29:12.360 --> 29:14.715
Shifu, open another
scroll or something.

29:15.320 --> 29:16.639
I think he should go.

29:16.800 --> 29:18.279
Fine, a third opinion.

29:18.480 --> 29:20.550
Monkey? Viper? Tigress?

29:20.720 --> 29:23.393
Dad, you heard what
Shifu said Oogway said.

29:23.560 --> 29:26.233
This guy can only be stopped
by a master of chi.

29:26.400 --> 29:29.631
And I can only master chi
by knowing who I really am.

29:30.160 --> 29:32.390
Well, I'm a panda.

29:36.400 --> 29:38.516
I'll pack you a lunch
for the road.

29:45.040 --> 29:47.873
Do you really think
Po can master chi in time?

29:48.040 --> 29:49.712
Doesn't matter
what I think.

29:49.840 --> 29:51.717
It only matters
what the universe thinks.

29:51.880 --> 29:53.757
So, that's a "no"?

29:53.920 --> 29:55.558
Master, what are
we going to do?

29:55.720 --> 29:57.676
You are going to find
out where Kai is.

29:57.840 --> 29:59.440
Follow the trail
of those jade creatures.

29:59.880 --> 30:01.154
But do not engage,

30:01.360 --> 30:04.716
for with every foe he faces,
Kai becomes stronger.

30:04.880 --> 30:06.871
Why me? Is it
because I asked?

30:07.040 --> 30:09.554
No. It is because
you can fly. Go!

30:10.520 --> 30:12.556
Should have kept
your beak shut.

30:12.720 --> 30:13.835
And take Mantis.

30:14.040 --> 30:15.080
Oh, man. Is it
because I...

30:15.240 --> 30:16.309
Yes.

30:43.320 --> 30:44.355
Oh! Lunch break.

30:44.440 --> 30:45.440
Oh.

30:45.600 --> 30:46.999
You don't need
to ask me twice.

30:47.080 --> 30:48.877
Dad?

30:49.040 --> 30:50.632
Yes?
Dad?

30:50.920 --> 30:51.920
Yes?

30:52.040 --> 30:53.075
What are you doing here?

30:53.240 --> 30:55.708
What am I doing?
Getting a backache.

30:55.880 --> 30:57.791
Did you have to step
on every rock?

30:58.000 --> 30:59.752
No, I mean,
why are you here?

30:59.960 --> 31:01.473
What was I supposed
to do, huh?

31:01.600 --> 31:03.716
What if the pandas
don't have food you like?

31:03.920 --> 31:05.717
You're never gonna be able
to save the world

31:05.840 --> 31:07.432
on an empty stomach.

31:07.600 --> 31:10.114
I consider my presence
mission critical.

31:10.280 --> 31:11.633
Oh... Yes, about that...

31:11.800 --> 31:15.634
We can't share the location of
the village with others. So...

31:15.800 --> 31:18.792
Well, you think I can't
keep a secret, huh?

31:18.960 --> 31:20.951
I raised Po for 20 years

31:21.080 --> 31:23.196
before I finally
told him he was adopted.

31:23.280 --> 31:25.157
Seriously?
Yeah.

31:25.360 --> 31:28.432
Okay. I guess it would be
cruel to make you fly back.

31:30.120 --> 31:31.758
You can fly?

31:31.920 --> 31:33.273
I'm a bird, Po.

31:50.160 --> 31:51.160
We're here.

31:55.680 --> 31:58.672
Sure looks like a long
ways up there.

31:58.840 --> 32:00.671
And my son hates stairs.

32:00.840 --> 32:02.273
So, let's go home.

32:02.480 --> 32:04.948
We're pandas.
We don't do stairs.

32:05.120 --> 32:07.031
I've waited my whole life
to hear those words.

32:11.160 --> 32:12.195
Rats.

32:21.360 --> 32:23.476
Whoa... Huh?

32:35.320 --> 32:37.880
This is the secret
panda village?

32:38.040 --> 32:40.076
No wonder
you keep it a secret.

32:40.240 --> 32:43.038
If I lived here,
I wouldn't tell anyone either.

32:47.720 --> 32:49.392
Now you can "Whoa."

32:49.560 --> 32:52.154
Whoa!

32:52.560 --> 32:53.560
Let's go!

32:53.720 --> 32:54.760
Over here! Come on!

33:05.560 --> 33:07.232
Look over there!

33:19.120 --> 33:20.120
Oh...

33:21.200 --> 33:24.351
My turn! My turn!
Come on, faster, faster!

33:26.240 --> 33:27.240
Li?

33:27.400 --> 33:29.072
Everyone! Li's back!

33:29.240 --> 33:31.310
They're both back!
He found his son!

33:31.440 --> 33:32.475
He made it!
They're back!

33:32.600 --> 33:34.238
Li?
He found his son!

33:34.400 --> 33:36.038
Everyone! Li's back!

33:36.240 --> 33:38.151
Hang on, we're coming!

33:38.320 --> 33:40.117
He made it!
Whoo-hoo!

33:40.280 --> 33:41.952
They made it!
Why are we running?

33:42.160 --> 33:43.991
- Here we come!
- He's back!

33:44.160 --> 33:45.752
They made it!

33:45.960 --> 33:48.076
Li Shan is back!

33:58.080 --> 33:59.080
Hi!

33:59.120 --> 34:00.155
Everyone!

34:00.280 --> 34:02.635
Everyone, gather around!
This is my son!

34:02.800 --> 34:03.915
Hello, hi.
He's here!

34:04.080 --> 34:05.479
You're here!
Triplets!

34:05.640 --> 34:06.959
Hi, I'm Ku Ku!

34:07.120 --> 34:08.109
I'm Meng Meng.
I'm Shuai Shuai.

34:08.280 --> 34:09.918
Your fur is soft.
He smells like cookies.

34:10.080 --> 34:13.629
He's so handsome,
just like his father.

34:13.800 --> 34:14.800
Thank you.

34:14.960 --> 34:16.951
Son, these are
your cousins.

34:17.120 --> 34:18.757
Dim and Sum.

34:18.840 --> 34:19.840
I have cousins!

34:19.960 --> 34:20.960
Welcome!
Welcome!

34:21.159 --> 34:22.639
Whoa! Buns on a string.

34:22.800 --> 34:23.835
We call it a snacklace.

34:24.040 --> 34:25.320
That's right.

34:25.679 --> 34:27.351
Uh... We'll make
you another one.

34:27.480 --> 34:28.549
Oh!

34:28.639 --> 34:29.675
It's you!

34:29.880 --> 34:32.474
So... That's nice. Yeah, hi!

34:32.639 --> 34:34.471
I don't know who you are.

34:34.639 --> 34:36.995
Oh, Stripy Baby. So beautiful.

34:38.199 --> 34:40.280
Oh! Okay, careful with that.
That's my action figure.

34:40.320 --> 34:42.436
Can I keep her?
Can I? No...

34:44.120 --> 34:45.268
Problem. Of course.

34:45.440 --> 34:46.639
Yeah.
That's why I brought her.

34:46.719 --> 34:47.789
Take good care of her.

34:47.960 --> 34:50.268
Yes! Stripy Baby.

34:51.480 --> 34:55.155
You look just like me,
but a baby.

34:57.720 --> 35:00.792
You're like me, but old.

35:00.960 --> 35:03.838
You're like me, but fatter!

35:04.000 --> 35:05.797
You're like me, but

35:07.080 --> 35:08.229
with a hat.

35:09.640 --> 35:11.198
He does wear a hat!

35:11.360 --> 35:13.032
You all look like me.

35:14.480 --> 35:17.040
Let's feast in
my son's honor.

35:19.520 --> 35:20.520
What the...

35:20.680 --> 35:22.989
Pandas don't walk. We roll!

35:28.080 --> 35:30.435
Have you ever seen anyone
look so ridiculous?

35:32.200 --> 35:34.077
Po, what are
you doing? Po!

35:46.080 --> 35:48.230
Ohh! Ow!

35:48.840 --> 35:50.876
You're right,
that is better than walking.

35:52.240 --> 35:54.117
Mmm!

35:54.760 --> 35:55.988
Yeah, that's the good stuff.

35:56.080 --> 35:57.160
Have some dumplings.

35:57.200 --> 35:59.509
What kind of panda
doesn't know how to roll?

35:59.680 --> 36:02.194
Well, I'm kind of new at this
whole "being a panda" thing.

36:02.360 --> 36:03.839
Hey, what kind
of panda are you?

36:03.920 --> 36:05.399
You have a funny neck.

36:05.520 --> 36:06.555
I'm not a panda at all.

36:06.600 --> 36:07.919
What's that? What's that?
My hat. My beak.

36:08.040 --> 36:09.040
What's that?
My wing.

36:09.080 --> 36:10.718
What's that?
My dumplings.

36:10.800 --> 36:12.916
No more questions!
Go away, kid.

36:13.080 --> 36:14.718
Here, son. I packed
your chopsticks.

36:14.800 --> 36:15.800
- Thanks, Dad.
- Wow.

36:15.960 --> 36:16.960
Oh, my.

36:17.080 --> 36:18.080
What?

36:18.720 --> 36:19.755
What are those for?

36:19.920 --> 36:21.000
These? These
are chopsticks.

36:21.080 --> 36:22.069
They're for picking
up dumplings.

36:22.240 --> 36:24.959
You mean you only eat
one at a time?

36:26.800 --> 36:27.915
Yummy.

36:28.120 --> 36:29.269
Yeah, yummy.

36:31.440 --> 36:33.954
I knew I wasn't eating
up to my potential!

36:42.480 --> 36:43.595
Huh?

36:48.640 --> 36:50.915
I am Mei Mei.

36:51.080 --> 36:54.516
Wow, she's amazing.
She's so beautiful.

36:54.680 --> 36:55.908
That's sweet, Po.

36:56.080 --> 36:58.469
But please, try to save
all other compliments

36:58.600 --> 37:00.477
until after the performance.

37:01.920 --> 37:03.353
Me? No, I didn't say...

37:04.840 --> 37:06.432
Shut it.

37:06.600 --> 37:08.158
After the performance.

37:08.320 --> 37:10.311
Huh! Has it
started yet?

37:13.160 --> 37:16.755
Best ribbon dancer
in the world!

37:16.880 --> 37:18.279
At least,
that's what she said.

37:18.440 --> 37:19.998
Look away. Look away.

37:20.160 --> 37:22.310
No. You can't, can you?

37:22.480 --> 37:24.994
Dad, why does she
keep staring at me like

37:25.120 --> 37:26.120
that!

37:26.160 --> 37:27.160
Try to keep up.

37:29.280 --> 37:30.872
I don't really know
how to dance!

37:31.040 --> 37:34.112
Of course you do.
All pandas dance.

37:35.000 --> 37:37.195
I know what you were thinking.
You do?

37:37.320 --> 37:39.550
"How can one
panda be so beautiful?"

37:43.200 --> 37:45.316
For me? Oh!

37:45.480 --> 37:46.833
Ooh, ooh, ooh!

37:46.960 --> 37:47.995
Po.

37:48.200 --> 37:50.156
Help me, Dads.
Yeah, no, you're on your own.

37:50.320 --> 37:51.548
You're doing
great, son.

37:53.800 --> 37:55.028
Your turn.

37:59.400 --> 38:00.719
Oh!

38:05.080 --> 38:06.080
Huh?

38:08.200 --> 38:09.758
Yay, Po!

38:11.360 --> 38:13.555
Don't worry.
You'll get the hang of it.

38:15.240 --> 38:16.992
I have so much to learn.

38:25.720 --> 38:27.676
Wings of Surveillance!

38:27.840 --> 38:29.398
Why do you do that?
Do what?

38:29.560 --> 38:31.198
Just because you say
"Wings of" before something,

38:31.360 --> 38:32.998
it doesn't mean that you're
doing a special move.

38:33.200 --> 38:35.395
It's like me saying
"Antenna of Power"

38:35.520 --> 38:38.717
or "Thorax of
Making Sandwiches."

38:38.920 --> 38:40.194
Wings of Disagreement.

38:40.360 --> 38:41.588
Whoa! There.

38:42.960 --> 38:45.315
Master Bear,
Master Chicken, Master Croc!

38:45.400 --> 38:46.594
What are you doing out here?

38:46.800 --> 38:48.438
Jade creatures
attacked our villages.

38:48.560 --> 38:49.709
We've tracked them here.

38:49.880 --> 38:51.393
Stop!

38:53.920 --> 38:56.070
They must be in there.

38:56.560 --> 38:58.198
Master Shifu strongly
advised us

39:02.560 --> 39:03.788
not to engage.

39:03.960 --> 39:05.473
We've gotta get in there.
But Master Shifu said...

39:05.640 --> 39:06.709
You're seriously afraid?

39:06.880 --> 39:09.758
Even Master Chicken's going
in there! And he's a chicken.

39:18.160 --> 39:20.116
That's it.
I'm going in.

39:20.240 --> 39:22.310
Mantis! We have orders not to...
They need our help!

39:22.440 --> 39:24.351
Come on.
I'll go high, you go low.

39:24.440 --> 39:25.475
No, wait.

39:26.240 --> 39:27.639
Fear the bug!

39:27.840 --> 39:29.319
All right, you little...

39:29.440 --> 39:30.440
Uh-oh!

39:30.560 --> 39:31.675
Hold on, buddy. I'm coming!

39:31.840 --> 39:34.229
Antenna of Power!
Ah! It didn't work!

39:34.400 --> 39:35.435
Mantis!

39:40.320 --> 39:41.594
Mantis?

39:42.800 --> 39:44.756
Mantis.

39:56.800 --> 39:58.631
Your chi is strong.

39:59.320 --> 40:00.639
Just like your friend,

40:01.640 --> 40:02.789
the bug.

40:03.280 --> 40:04.793
Mantis.

40:13.320 --> 40:15.038
Don't worry, little birdie.

40:15.680 --> 40:18.035
I'll put your chi
to good use,

40:18.680 --> 40:23.037
destroying the Jade Palace
and everyone in it.

40:23.320 --> 40:24.389
No!

40:31.360 --> 40:33.351
Wings of Regret!

40:41.080 --> 40:42.354
Hmm. Oh, yeah.

40:42.520 --> 40:43.839
First day of panda training!

40:44.040 --> 40:45.598
All right, flower.

40:45.680 --> 40:48.069
I'm gonna make you bloom.

40:48.200 --> 40:49.872
Whoo-hoo!

40:50.000 --> 40:51.149
Dad. Dad.

40:51.320 --> 40:52.355
What? What? What is it?

40:52.520 --> 40:54.280
I'm ready for my first day
of panda training.

40:54.320 --> 40:55.469
What?
You know, learn to be

40:55.560 --> 40:57.516
a panda, master chi,
save the world!

40:57.720 --> 40:59.836
Pandas sleep
till past noon.

41:00.000 --> 41:02.833
So lesson
number one is, "Go back to bed."

41:03.320 --> 41:05.231
Oh! Of course!

41:07.840 --> 41:09.876
Nobody said this was
gonna be easy.

41:15.680 --> 41:17.033
Did I oversleep?

41:17.240 --> 41:18.240
You sure did.

41:18.400 --> 41:19.400
Yes!

41:19.560 --> 41:20.560
Yeah! Show him, kids!

41:20.720 --> 41:22.517
Can you do this?
Can you do that?

41:22.680 --> 41:23.880
How about this?
How about that?

41:24.040 --> 41:25.758
Am I doing it?
Is this good? Whoa!

41:25.960 --> 41:27.518
I got it! Ka-blam!

41:28.240 --> 41:29.240
Whoa!

41:29.400 --> 41:30.760
Grandma Panda, heads up!
Hello! Ow!

41:31.240 --> 41:32.240
Oh.
Uh-oh.

41:32.360 --> 41:34.191
We better roll.

41:34.440 --> 41:36.510
Po, lunch time.

41:36.600 --> 41:37.953
Oh!

41:43.040 --> 41:44.189
Po?

41:44.280 --> 41:46.635
You gotta let the hill
tell you where to roll.

41:46.760 --> 41:48.113
Oh! Rookie mistake.

41:48.280 --> 41:51.636
Dim, Sum, let's show him
how we go uphill!

41:51.760 --> 41:53.432
Whoo-hoo!

41:53.560 --> 41:54.913
It's beautiful.

41:55.080 --> 41:56.274
Snack time. Po!

41:56.440 --> 41:57.634
Whoo-hoo!

41:57.760 --> 41:59.113
You can fly?

41:59.280 --> 42:00.554
I'm coming in hot!

42:02.120 --> 42:04.111
Get them while
they're cold. Hmm.

42:06.400 --> 42:07.469
What are you doing there?

42:07.640 --> 42:09.232
That food is for Po!

42:09.320 --> 42:10.320
Throw it in!

42:12.920 --> 42:15.753
There, there. That's it.

42:15.840 --> 42:17.956
Feeling relaxed?
Totally.

42:18.080 --> 42:20.275
Just let yourself
fall into it.

42:20.440 --> 42:21.440
Got it.

42:26.120 --> 42:27.519
I'm fine. I just...

42:27.640 --> 42:30.074
There we go.
Just let it all out.

42:30.160 --> 42:31.639
That's my boy.

42:33.760 --> 42:34.840
Get out of there!

42:37.480 --> 42:38.674
Oh! My noodles!

42:38.800 --> 42:40.074
Leave my noodles alone.

42:44.320 --> 42:45.912
Subtle, Po. Very subtle.

42:46.120 --> 42:47.473
Let me get some of that.

42:47.960 --> 42:49.154
Oh!

42:49.480 --> 42:50.879
Hey, leave my hat alone!

42:55.040 --> 42:56.837
We love noodles!

42:57.000 --> 42:58.035
More noodles!

42:58.200 --> 42:59.679
Oh! Just like my Po.

43:04.720 --> 43:05.880
What are you guys looking at?

43:12.800 --> 43:15.712
That's how we roll!
Cannonball!

43:17.400 --> 43:18.833
Whoo-hoo! Yeah!

43:29.160 --> 43:30.673
Here, bring it up here.

43:30.840 --> 43:32.193
Mom, look it!
Whoa!

43:37.920 --> 43:39.194
How was that?

43:43.320 --> 43:44.673
Whoa!

43:44.840 --> 43:48.037
Now, you try again.
But don't try so hard.

43:48.200 --> 43:49.269
Okay. Okay.

43:54.720 --> 43:56.551
Much better.

44:04.400 --> 44:05.549
Thanks, Dad.

44:06.080 --> 44:07.229
For what?

44:07.400 --> 44:09.311
You know, just for,
you know,

44:09.400 --> 44:11.231
showing me
what it feels like

44:12.040 --> 44:13.519
to be a panda.

44:15.600 --> 44:17.670
So, when do you think
I'll be ready? Ready?

44:17.800 --> 44:19.392
You know, to learn
how to master chi.

44:20.240 --> 44:22.071
Soon. Real soon.

44:22.560 --> 44:24.160
Come on, I wanna
show you something else.

44:24.280 --> 44:25.349
Come on.

44:28.760 --> 44:32.230
Sorry about the mess.
I don't usually get visitors.

44:42.880 --> 44:45.633
Is this my mom?

44:51.400 --> 44:54.551
I had this done
on your 100th day.

44:55.920 --> 44:56.920
Hmm.

44:57.000 --> 44:59.230
Your momma couldn't
hold you still.

44:59.960 --> 45:01.439
You nearly ate
the paper.

45:03.280 --> 45:04.429
It's true.

45:04.600 --> 45:05.828
What was she like?

45:06.160 --> 45:07.160
Oh!

45:07.920 --> 45:10.957
She was the total package.

45:12.000 --> 45:15.276
Smart, beautiful,

45:15.480 --> 45:16.595
tremendous appetite.

45:18.640 --> 45:20.631
She was the love
of my life.

45:21.320 --> 45:25.199
And then, just when I thought
I couldn't get any luckier,

45:25.840 --> 45:26.909
along you came.

45:27.120 --> 45:29.634
My Little Lotus.

45:31.800 --> 45:33.677
I really had it all,

45:35.360 --> 45:39.478
until that one moment,

45:42.840 --> 45:47.152
when I lost everything.

46:24.240 --> 46:25.878
Dad.

46:26.040 --> 46:29.032
You don't have to worry about
losing me ever again.

46:29.920 --> 46:31.194
Okay?

46:40.240 --> 46:41.878
Let me get
some of that.

46:51.360 --> 46:53.555
It's from
the Eastern Province!

46:54.840 --> 46:59.914
Master Lizard, Master Ox,
Master Eagle. All of them.

47:00.720 --> 47:02.597
In every village
from the sea to here,

47:02.760 --> 47:05.558
every master in China,

47:05.760 --> 47:06.760
has vanished.

47:06.880 --> 47:08.154
Maybe they are
all at a party.

47:08.240 --> 47:09.275
Monkey.

47:09.400 --> 47:10.549
I didn't get
invited either.

47:10.760 --> 47:12.751
Kai has taken their chi.

47:12.920 --> 47:15.388
We are all that stand
between him,

47:15.600 --> 47:19.434
and the knowledge
Oogway left in our care.

47:19.800 --> 47:21.552
The villagers, evacuated?

47:21.720 --> 47:22.720
Done, Master.

47:23.080 --> 47:24.080
Crane, Mantis?

47:24.120 --> 47:25.120
Still nothing.

47:25.240 --> 47:26.639
Wait. It's them!

47:31.080 --> 47:32.080
No!

47:46.440 --> 47:47.440
Kai.

47:52.440 --> 47:53.634
Nice.

47:54.240 --> 47:55.389
Very tacky.

47:56.640 --> 47:59.074
How dare you set foot
on these grounds!

47:59.240 --> 48:01.629
Look at you pathetic fools.

48:01.800 --> 48:05.839
Groveling at the feet
of Oogway the Magnificent.

48:06.000 --> 48:08.150
You are not fit
to speak his name.

48:08.360 --> 48:10.954
I am not fit, little kitten?

48:12.800 --> 48:14.950
I fought by his side.

48:15.480 --> 48:17.948
I loved him like a brother.

48:18.160 --> 48:21.789
And he betrayed me.

48:25.000 --> 48:28.834
Now I will destroy
everything he has created!

48:30.320 --> 48:31.320
Go!

48:52.800 --> 48:54.233
How's that
for a little kitten?

49:10.680 --> 49:13.717
I will not let you
destroy Oogway's memory.

49:13.880 --> 49:16.235
Why not? He destroyed mine.

49:16.520 --> 49:17.589
Mantis.

49:17.720 --> 49:19.711
It is me, your bestie!

49:25.080 --> 49:26.308
Sorry, Tigress!

49:26.520 --> 49:29.080
Sorry! Sorry! Sorry!

49:29.200 --> 49:30.200
Sorry!

49:44.040 --> 49:45.075
Shifu.

49:45.520 --> 49:46.714
Bring them to me.

49:57.240 --> 49:58.275
No.

49:58.400 --> 49:59.515
You must warn Po.

49:59.640 --> 50:00.640
Master, please.

50:08.800 --> 50:12.759
I will show you the true
power of chi, brother.

50:15.080 --> 50:16.115
No.

50:52.120 --> 50:55.351
Oogway, forgive me.

50:55.840 --> 50:58.752
Hmm. What do
you say, Oogway?

50:58.920 --> 51:00.592
Do you forgive him?

51:01.360 --> 51:03.749
You may have destroyed
the Jade Palace,

51:03.920 --> 51:06.639
but you will never succeed.

51:06.800 --> 51:10.634
There will always
be someone to stop you.

51:10.800 --> 51:12.631
Who? The panda?

51:12.840 --> 51:14.831
His chi is strong,

51:15.600 --> 51:16.635
but it won't be enough.

51:17.720 --> 51:21.633
He will meet
the same fate as you.

51:21.800 --> 51:22.835
No.

51:23.280 --> 51:26.158
And so will every panda
in that village.

51:32.280 --> 51:33.793
Yes.

51:38.320 --> 51:40.675
Po, I hope
you're ready.

51:44.640 --> 51:46.278
Dance, Lotus. Dance.

51:48.360 --> 51:50.032
He's so handsome.

51:50.120 --> 51:51.348
Ooh!

51:51.680 --> 51:52.749
Hi!

51:53.320 --> 51:54.753
That's a panda hug!

51:55.520 --> 51:57.158
Hey.

52:01.360 --> 52:02.360
Po.

52:39.400 --> 52:40.400
Tigress?

52:43.400 --> 52:44.879
Who's she?

52:45.040 --> 52:46.189
Who is that?

52:47.880 --> 52:49.359
Big Stripy Baby!

52:51.080 --> 52:52.080
What are you
doing here?

52:52.240 --> 52:53.912
Kai attacked the Valley.

52:54.080 --> 52:55.433
He's taken every
master in China,

52:55.560 --> 52:56.760
including Shifu
and the others.

52:56.840 --> 52:59.752
It's all gone, Po.
Everything. Everyone.

52:59.920 --> 53:00.920
Everyone?

53:01.080 --> 53:02.080
Everyone.

53:02.600 --> 53:04.431
How's my restaurant?

53:05.880 --> 53:07.279
We'll talk later.

53:07.440 --> 53:08.759
And now he's on his way here.

53:08.920 --> 53:10.433
He's after you, Po.

53:11.080 --> 53:13.355
He's after all pandas.

53:13.440 --> 53:14.668
How long do we have?

53:14.760 --> 53:15.760
Not long.

53:15.920 --> 53:17.876
Please, tell me
you've mastered chi.

53:18.040 --> 53:19.360
Here, take the baby.
Dad! Dad!

53:19.440 --> 53:20.600
Okay, who belongs
to this one?

53:20.720 --> 53:22.680
You need to teach me
the secret chi technique now!

53:22.760 --> 53:24.910
No, no, I'm afraid
you need more time.

53:25.600 --> 53:27.238
Everyone, go get your things!
Let me help you with that.

53:27.400 --> 53:29.072
I don't have more time.
I need to learn it now!

53:29.240 --> 53:31.071
Sorry, you're not ready.

53:31.240 --> 53:32.389
Okay, pack everything!

53:32.600 --> 53:34.079
- I am ready.
- Not quite.

53:34.560 --> 53:36.630
What are you talking about?
I've done everything you've asked.

53:36.760 --> 53:38.273
I've mastered napping,
sleeping in,

53:38.440 --> 53:39.714
hammocks, hot tubs.

53:39.880 --> 53:41.791
I am totally at one
with my panda parts.

53:41.920 --> 53:42.955
Now why won't
you show me?

53:43.120 --> 53:45.236
Because I don't know it!

53:48.480 --> 53:49.480
You what?

53:49.560 --> 53:51.869
I don't know it, okay?
No one does.

53:52.080 --> 53:53.149
Maybe we used to.

53:54.120 --> 53:55.473
But not anymore.

53:55.960 --> 53:56.995
You lied?

53:57.080 --> 53:58.433
No, I...

54:00.120 --> 54:01.473
Yes.

54:01.640 --> 54:03.631
Wh... Why?

54:03.840 --> 54:05.398
To save your life!

54:05.560 --> 54:08.996
I find out some blade-swinging
maniac is coming for you.

54:09.160 --> 54:12.232
What am I supposed to do?
Just let that happen?

54:12.400 --> 54:16.837
Yes! I'm the Dragon Warrior.
Facing maniacs, that's my job!

54:17.000 --> 54:20.356
But because of you,
I left the Valley unprotected.

54:20.520 --> 54:22.238
I left my friends unprotected!

54:22.440 --> 54:23.793
And now they're all...

54:24.360 --> 54:25.360
They're all...

54:25.480 --> 54:27.277
And you would have been, too.

54:28.680 --> 54:30.750
I lost you once.

54:30.920 --> 54:33.309
I am not going
to lose you again.

54:34.200 --> 54:36.111
I can't.

54:41.880 --> 54:43.359
You just did.

54:54.800 --> 54:56.199
Mom! Pick me!

54:59.400 --> 55:00.400
Oh!

55:03.560 --> 55:05.118
Po, I'm so worried for you

55:05.320 --> 55:07.834
that I can't even enjoy
being right about everything.

55:08.000 --> 55:10.798
Now run, run, run, as fast
as those chubby legs can go!

55:10.960 --> 55:12.359
Run? There's
nowhere to run.

55:12.520 --> 55:14.158
But what are
you going to do?

55:14.320 --> 55:17.073
I'm gonna stay,
and fight that monster.

55:17.240 --> 55:20.516
Po, he may be a monster,
but he's still your father.

55:20.680 --> 55:22.193
Not him. Kai!

55:22.520 --> 55:24.078
No!

56:09.080 --> 56:10.229
Hungry?

56:10.400 --> 56:12.436
No, I... Not really.

56:13.200 --> 56:14.792
Well, maybe just one.

56:15.640 --> 56:19.553
You know, you weren't
the only one who was lying.

56:19.640 --> 56:20.640
Oh?

56:20.760 --> 56:22.034
I didn't really come along

56:22.120 --> 56:25.192
because I was worried Po
would go hungry.

56:25.280 --> 56:26.872
I was worried about you.

56:27.320 --> 56:28.799
Worried that I'd go hungry?

56:28.960 --> 56:30.109
No.

56:30.320 --> 56:32.709
I was worried
you'd steal Po from me.

56:32.800 --> 56:33.800
I'd what?

56:33.880 --> 56:36.599
I know. That was crazy.

56:37.320 --> 56:39.470
But I realize having you

56:39.600 --> 56:42.910
in Po's life doesn't
mean less for me.

56:43.080 --> 56:45.310
It means more for Po.

56:45.760 --> 56:46.988
Oh.

56:48.960 --> 56:50.837
Well, I'm not in his life.

56:51.000 --> 56:52.228
Not anymore.

56:52.320 --> 56:54.834
Your son got mad at you.

56:55.000 --> 56:56.319
Welcome to parenthood.

56:56.480 --> 56:59.517
You don't understand.
I lied to him.

57:00.120 --> 57:01.473
He'll never forgive me.

57:01.640 --> 57:03.915
I lied to him for 20 years.

57:04.080 --> 57:06.150
He still thinks
he came from an egg.

57:06.840 --> 57:11.516
Sometimes, we do the wrong
things for the right reasons.

57:19.640 --> 57:20.640
Look.

57:20.680 --> 57:22.352
He's hurt.

57:22.520 --> 57:24.033
He's confused.

57:24.800 --> 57:27.758
And he still has
to save the world.

57:27.960 --> 57:30.838
He needs both his dads.

57:49.360 --> 57:50.793
This isn't going to work.

57:50.960 --> 57:51.960
It has to.

57:52.120 --> 57:53.109
You're not
thinking straight.

57:53.240 --> 57:54.514
I am!
You're not.

57:54.680 --> 57:55.680
I am!
No.

57:55.840 --> 57:56.840
Yes, I am.
No.

57:57.000 --> 57:58.718
I've seen Kai.

57:58.880 --> 58:00.518
I've seen what he can do.

58:00.680 --> 58:02.796
But he hasn't seen
what I can do.

58:06.720 --> 58:08.199
The Wuxi Finger Hold?

58:08.920 --> 58:09.920
It's my best move.

58:10.080 --> 58:11.399
I just have to get to Kai,

58:11.520 --> 58:12.840
grab his finger
and then skadoosh!

58:12.920 --> 58:14.478
Back to the Spirit Realm.

58:14.560 --> 58:16.357
He has an army
of jade warriors.

58:16.520 --> 58:18.317
Everything they see,
he sees.

58:18.400 --> 58:19.913
So there's no
sneaking up on him.

58:20.040 --> 58:21.080
You will never get

58:21.160 --> 58:22.832
close enough.
It's gonna work!

58:25.080 --> 58:27.833
He can only be stopped
by a master of chi.

58:27.920 --> 58:30.120
Oh, you sound just like Shifu
with the, "Chi, chi, chi."

58:30.200 --> 58:32.031
"Chi this. Chi that."
"Chi, chi, chi!"

58:32.200 --> 58:34.350
I'm not a master
of chi, okay?

58:34.520 --> 58:35.839
I don't know if I'm
the Dragon Warrior.

58:35.920 --> 58:37.433
I don't even know
if I'm a panda!

58:37.600 --> 58:39.033
I don't know who I am!

58:41.840 --> 58:42.840
You're right.

58:42.920 --> 58:45.070
There's no way I can
stop him and his army.

58:49.440 --> 58:51.954
Unless you had
an army of your own.

58:55.280 --> 58:56.280
You?

58:56.800 --> 58:58.392
Not just me.

58:58.560 --> 58:59.959
Us.

59:00.120 --> 59:01.394
All of us.

59:10.640 --> 59:14.553
I finally found my son,
after all these years.

59:15.280 --> 59:17.748
It's going to take a lot more
than the end of the world

59:17.920 --> 59:18.955
to keep us apart.

59:19.120 --> 59:21.076
But you don't
even know kung fu.

59:21.280 --> 59:23.555
Then you will teach us.

59:23.720 --> 59:26.314
What? I can't
teach you kung fu.

59:26.480 --> 59:31.554
I couldn't even teach Tigress.
And she already knows kung fu!

59:32.160 --> 59:37.075
Po, I know I'm the last guy
you wanna trust right now.

59:37.920 --> 59:39.319
But you gotta believe me.

59:39.480 --> 59:41.118
We can do this.

59:41.280 --> 59:43.236
We can learn kung fu.

59:43.400 --> 59:45.994
We can be just like you!

59:47.000 --> 59:48.080
What did you just say?
Uh...

59:49.280 --> 59:50.679
"We can do this"?
No!

59:51.320 --> 59:52.833
"We can learn kung fu"?
After that!

59:52.960 --> 59:54.473
Uh... "We can be
just like you"?

59:54.640 --> 59:55.959
Yes!
We can?

59:56.120 --> 59:57.678
No! You can't!

59:59.160 --> 01:00:00.513
But you don't have to be!

01:00:01.800 --> 01:00:03.119
That's what Shifu meant.

01:00:03.280 --> 01:00:04.838
I don't have to
turn you into me.

01:00:04.920 --> 01:00:06.353
I have to turn you into you!

01:00:07.520 --> 01:00:09.112
That doesn't
make any sense.

01:00:09.280 --> 01:00:11.111
I know!

01:00:11.320 --> 01:00:12.594
Thanks, Dads.

01:00:12.760 --> 01:00:14.034
You're welcome?

01:00:14.200 --> 01:00:17.158
I'm gonna do something I never
thought I'd be able to do.

01:00:17.320 --> 01:00:19.515
I'm gonna teach kung fu.

01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:24.034
You guys, your real strength
comes from being

01:00:24.160 --> 01:00:25.200
the best "you" you can be.

01:00:25.360 --> 01:00:26.554
So who are you?

01:00:26.720 --> 01:00:28.039
<i>What are you good at?</i>

01:00:28.200 --> 01:00:29.553
<i>What do you love?</i>

01:00:29.720 --> 01:00:30.789
<i>What makes you, "you"?</i>

01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:31.995
Whoo-hoo!

01:00:33.320 --> 01:00:36.630
Yes, good. Good. Again.

01:00:39.640 --> 01:00:40.868
Good. Again.

01:00:41.720 --> 01:00:43.392
Good, good, good. Again.

01:00:45.040 --> 01:00:47.190
Stripy Baby! Stripy Baby!

01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:50.994
Faster, faster!
Twirl those ribbons!

01:00:51.160 --> 01:00:52.388
Hug that log, you!

01:00:52.560 --> 01:00:54.152
Hug that log
like it's the last time

01:00:54.240 --> 01:00:56.071
you're ever gonna hug it
goodbye forever.

01:00:56.240 --> 01:00:57.912
Higher! And a little more
to the left this time.

01:00:58.040 --> 01:00:59.040
You can do it!

01:00:59.080 --> 01:01:00.638
Whoo-hoo!

01:01:00.760 --> 01:01:02.159
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:01:02.240 --> 01:01:04.674
I don't wanna see any of
these hit the ground!

01:01:15.880 --> 01:01:17.996
Wait, wait, Stripy Baby!

01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:20.555
Good! Try it with this.

01:01:22.440 --> 01:01:24.749
Now try it with these!

01:01:28.840 --> 01:01:30.910
Good! Now try
it with these.

01:01:34.440 --> 01:01:35.759
Oh! Oh!

01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:04.599
Whoo!

01:02:05.640 --> 01:02:07.039
They are ready.

01:02:09.760 --> 01:02:11.193
What?

01:02:11.600 --> 01:02:13.795
Okay, pay attention because
I'm only gonna go over this

01:02:13.920 --> 01:02:15.148
10 more times.

01:02:15.320 --> 01:02:18.073
The only entrance
to the village is here.

01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:20.549
The dumpling squadron
will take position here,

01:02:20.720 --> 01:02:23.234
while the cookie squadron
will take position here.

01:02:23.400 --> 01:02:25.834
Now, on my signal,
the two squadrons will...

01:02:28.280 --> 01:02:29.759
Right, okay.

01:02:29.920 --> 01:02:31.672
The noodle squadron will...

01:02:36.840 --> 01:02:38.990
Okay. Anyway,
the important thing to remember

01:02:39.080 --> 01:02:40.513
is that this
is the spot where...

01:02:43.520 --> 01:02:45.158
Okay, I saw that coming.

01:02:45.360 --> 01:02:46.839
If you only remember
one thing,

01:02:46.960 --> 01:02:48.313
it's distract the jombies

01:02:48.480 --> 01:02:51.313
until I get close enough to
put a Wuxi Finger Hold on Kai.

01:02:51.480 --> 01:02:52.993
- You got it?
- Yeah!

01:02:54.200 --> 01:02:56.350
Pandas on three!
One, two three, Pan...

01:02:56.520 --> 01:02:59.956
You guys... Never mind,
I'll teach you that later.

01:03:35.480 --> 01:03:38.392
I wish I could have
taught you this, son.

01:03:38.560 --> 01:03:40.312
It's okay, Dad. I'm...

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:48.558
He's here.

01:04:12.920 --> 01:04:14.831
Wow!

01:04:15.280 --> 01:04:17.589
That's what I call
a Dramatic Entrance!

01:04:22.120 --> 01:04:24.554
Ha-ha! You must be
the Dragon Warrior.

01:04:24.720 --> 01:04:27.359
And you must be Kai!

01:04:27.520 --> 01:04:29.954
Beast of Vengeance,
Maker of Widows!

01:04:31.040 --> 01:04:34.430
Yes! Finally! Thank you!

01:04:34.640 --> 01:04:36.437
Almost makes me wanna
spare your life.

01:04:36.640 --> 01:04:37.959
Oh, you wanna spare me?

01:04:38.120 --> 01:04:40.270
How about you spare me
the chit-chat?

01:04:40.400 --> 01:04:42.231
All right? Let's do this.

01:04:42.440 --> 01:04:44.396
I'm going to take your chi,

01:04:44.560 --> 01:04:47.199
then the chi
of every panda in the...

01:04:47.320 --> 01:04:48.469
Oh! Chit-chat!

01:04:48.640 --> 01:04:50.073
In this...
Chitty-chitty chat-chat.

01:04:50.280 --> 01:04:51.554
In...
Chat, chat, chat.

01:04:52.320 --> 01:04:53.548
In the...
Chit-chat!

01:04:53.640 --> 01:04:56.313
Oh, you pudgy little...

01:05:00.800 --> 01:05:02.597
Round them all up.

01:05:16.280 --> 01:05:18.316
Oh, no. It's true.

01:05:18.480 --> 01:05:20.436
You guys have all been
turned green!

01:05:20.640 --> 01:05:23.518
Except for you, Mantis.
You were already green.

01:05:25.600 --> 01:05:26.794
Now?
Wait for the signal.

01:05:29.480 --> 01:05:30.595
Here we go!

01:05:41.520 --> 01:05:42.635
Dumpling Squad!

01:05:42.800 --> 01:05:44.518
Ready?
Go time!

01:05:44.680 --> 01:05:46.352
Belly!
Gong!

01:05:47.520 --> 01:05:48.520
Whoo!

01:05:50.040 --> 01:05:51.040
Seriously?

01:05:51.120 --> 01:05:52.360
Yeah! Whoo!
We did it! Whoo-hoo!

01:05:53.360 --> 01:05:54.588
Sorry, Crane.

01:06:02.640 --> 01:06:05.200
Spring Roll Squad!
Time for some takeout!

01:06:12.040 --> 01:06:13.712
Yoo-hoo!

01:06:14.040 --> 01:06:15.553
Over here, Mr. Jombie!

01:06:21.320 --> 01:06:23.197
I don't know who
you are, either.

01:06:23.560 --> 01:06:24.560
Noodle Squad!

01:06:28.080 --> 01:06:29.798
Get ready to dance

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:31.479
with danger!

01:06:35.560 --> 01:06:36.754
Oh, sweet!

01:06:48.680 --> 01:06:49.749
Stripy Baby!

01:06:49.920 --> 01:06:50.920
Oh.

01:06:51.040 --> 01:06:52.040
Whee!

01:06:55.400 --> 01:06:57.038
Do it.
You're mean!

01:07:02.920 --> 01:07:04.194
Fire!

01:07:09.840 --> 01:07:10.955
Fire in the hole!

01:07:11.120 --> 01:07:12.189
Oh!

01:07:12.440 --> 01:07:13.509
Yes!

01:07:13.600 --> 01:07:15.272
All right, kids!

01:07:15.440 --> 01:07:16.793
You got it, guys!

01:07:20.560 --> 01:07:21.879
Oh, no! Master Shifu!

01:07:23.720 --> 01:07:24.720
I can't hit Shifu!

01:07:26.920 --> 01:07:27.955
I can!

01:07:28.120 --> 01:07:29.792
And so can I.

01:07:31.600 --> 01:07:33.113
Double-Dad Defense!

01:07:33.400 --> 01:07:34.549
Left, Dad!
Right, Dad!

01:07:34.720 --> 01:07:35.720
Thanks, Dad!

01:07:35.880 --> 01:07:37.074
Back at you, Dad.

01:07:37.280 --> 01:07:38.793
We've got this, son!

01:07:39.640 --> 01:07:40.709
Go, Dads!

01:07:40.880 --> 01:07:41.880
Yeah!

01:07:45.320 --> 01:07:46.799
Yeah!

01:07:46.920 --> 01:07:47.989
We got them now.

01:07:48.080 --> 01:07:50.992
Stop. Stop! Enough!

01:07:53.160 --> 01:07:54.275
Get out...

01:07:58.400 --> 01:07:59.799
Let's finish this.

01:08:01.920 --> 01:08:02.920
That's our boy!

01:08:18.600 --> 01:08:21.511
Sorry, buddy. Gotta send you
back to the Spirit Realm.

01:08:21.680 --> 01:08:22.749
Skadoosh!

01:08:24.840 --> 01:08:27.752
Okay, that didn't work.
Let me try one more time.

01:08:27.920 --> 01:08:31.515
Skadoosh! Skadoosh. Skadoosh.
Skadoo... What the...

01:08:31.680 --> 01:08:33.591
Hold on, wait!
It's working.

01:08:33.760 --> 01:08:35.671
No. No!

01:08:40.479 --> 01:08:42.595
No, it's not.

01:08:42.800 --> 01:08:44.438
Did Oogway teach you
that little trick?

01:08:45.120 --> 01:08:46.314
Too bad.

01:08:46.479 --> 01:08:48.550
It only works on mortals.

01:08:48.720 --> 01:08:52.474
And I am a Spirit Warrior.

01:08:52.560 --> 01:08:53.629
Come!

01:09:22.640 --> 01:09:23.675
Whoa!

01:09:39.240 --> 01:09:40.434
Son!

01:09:40.840 --> 01:09:41.908
Po!

01:09:44.279 --> 01:09:45.554
I was wrong.

01:09:45.720 --> 01:09:48.188
I'm sorry. Run. Run!

01:10:00.720 --> 01:10:02.233
So, Oogway,

01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:06.188
this was the one
destined to stop me?

01:10:06.360 --> 01:10:08.510
I will have his chi,

01:10:08.960 --> 01:10:11.269
and then all of theirs!

01:10:26.640 --> 01:10:29.154
And you...

01:10:30.480 --> 01:10:34.234
You really thought you could send
me back to the Spirit Realm?

01:10:40.280 --> 01:10:42.396
You are just a stupid mortal.

01:10:43.640 --> 01:10:45.631
It only works on mortals.

01:10:48.120 --> 01:10:50.236
You're right.
I can't send you there.

01:10:51.800 --> 01:10:52.994
But I can take you there.

01:10:53.600 --> 01:10:54.720
What's that?

01:10:56.080 --> 01:10:57.229
What?

01:10:57.640 --> 01:10:58.993
Po!
Son!

01:10:59.800 --> 01:11:01.119
Skadoosh.

01:11:01.280 --> 01:11:02.508
Son!

01:11:03.240 --> 01:11:04.275
No!

01:11:26.440 --> 01:11:27.714
What happened?

01:11:27.880 --> 01:11:28.880
Where's Po?

01:11:29.360 --> 01:11:32.636
He took Kai away.
He saved us.

01:11:32.800 --> 01:11:33.949
No.

01:11:35.680 --> 01:11:38.717
He saved us,
but who's saving him?

01:11:43.280 --> 01:11:44.633
Whoa!

01:11:44.800 --> 01:11:46.995
The Spirit Realm. It worked!

01:11:48.360 --> 01:11:49.360
Get off me, you...

01:11:49.960 --> 01:11:52.394
You brought me back?

01:11:52.960 --> 01:11:55.474
Don't blame me. I tried to finish
this in the regular realm.

01:11:55.640 --> 01:11:57.710
Then we'll finish it here!

01:12:05.720 --> 01:12:06.720
Whoa!

01:12:31.400 --> 01:12:34.631
Come on, son. Fight!

01:12:41.640 --> 01:12:43.278
We have to help him.

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:45.069
We have to help him!

01:12:45.240 --> 01:12:46.400
Okay. Everyone gather around.

01:12:46.440 --> 01:12:48.635
That's it. Come in close.
Come on.

01:12:48.840 --> 01:12:50.478
We can do this.

01:12:58.280 --> 01:12:59.554
Po...

01:12:59.720 --> 01:13:02.951
You taught us who
we were meant to be.

01:13:06.480 --> 01:13:08.710
A father.

01:13:12.520 --> 01:13:13.839
A friend.

01:13:14.440 --> 01:13:15.634
A dumpling kicker.

01:13:15.800 --> 01:13:17.358
A lethal fighting machine.

01:13:17.520 --> 01:13:18.748
A hugger.

01:13:20.720 --> 01:13:22.597
A nunchuck chick.

01:13:22.960 --> 01:13:24.916
Stripy Baby.

01:13:25.960 --> 01:13:27.439
A family.

01:13:57.280 --> 01:13:58.474
Sweet!

01:14:07.080 --> 01:14:08.718
Whoa.

01:14:14.160 --> 01:14:15.434
Who are you?

01:14:15.600 --> 01:14:17.989
I've been asking
the same question.

01:14:22.560 --> 01:14:24.278
Am I the son of a panda?

01:14:24.480 --> 01:14:26.198
The son of a goose?

01:14:26.360 --> 01:14:27.429
A student?

01:14:28.320 --> 01:14:29.594
A teacher?

01:14:30.880 --> 01:14:32.279
Turns out,

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:34.115
I'm all of them.

01:14:42.960 --> 01:14:46.475
I am the Dragon Warrior.

01:14:47.320 --> 01:14:49.595
Get it? See the giant dragon?

01:14:51.320 --> 01:14:53.311
Get ready to feel the thunder.

01:14:53.920 --> 01:14:55.558
This is awesome!

01:15:01.800 --> 01:15:03.597
Whoo-hoo!

01:15:06.360 --> 01:15:07.360
Hmm.

01:15:13.840 --> 01:15:14.840
Uh-oh.

01:15:21.640 --> 01:15:22.640
Belly Gong.

01:15:24.240 --> 01:15:25.514
Butt Slap.

01:15:28.680 --> 01:15:29.715
Perhaps a bit of lunch.

01:15:29.920 --> 01:15:30.989
Because I'm starving.

01:15:34.960 --> 01:15:35.960
Mmm.

01:15:50.840 --> 01:15:51.840
Let's do this!

01:15:56.560 --> 01:15:57.560
Heads up!

01:16:12.440 --> 01:16:16.479
It took me 500 years
to take Oogway's chi.

01:16:16.640 --> 01:16:20.076
I will have yours
if it takes me 500 more.

01:16:20.240 --> 01:16:21.355
Chitty-chitty chat-chat.

01:16:21.520 --> 01:16:23.238
Chit-chat.

01:16:33.920 --> 01:16:35.911
You want my chi so bad,

01:16:36.400 --> 01:16:37.469
then take it.

01:16:44.520 --> 01:16:45.839
Yes.

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.594
The power is mine.

01:16:51.160 --> 01:16:53.628
Wait. No. It's too much.

01:16:53.800 --> 01:16:56.030
That's too much! No!

01:17:00.080 --> 01:17:01.718
No!

01:17:12.520 --> 01:17:13.520
Oh!

01:17:13.600 --> 01:17:15.158
Where did he go?

01:17:20.520 --> 01:17:21.714
Oh!

01:17:22.520 --> 01:17:24.272
We're back!

01:17:24.360 --> 01:17:25.360
Bestie!

01:17:25.440 --> 01:17:27.032
I'm still green!
It didn't work!

01:17:27.240 --> 01:17:29.037
Oh, wait.
That's my normal green.

01:17:29.200 --> 01:17:30.519
Greeny Baby!

01:17:30.680 --> 01:17:32.796
Not a baby.
Not a baby!

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:34.228
Antenna of Fear!

01:17:34.760 --> 01:17:36.079
What about Po?

01:17:36.160 --> 01:17:37.160
Have you seen Po?

01:17:37.280 --> 01:17:38.918
No. He's not here?

01:17:39.600 --> 01:17:41.989
Po? Po?

01:17:42.160 --> 01:17:44.037
Why isn't he back?

01:17:54.440 --> 01:17:56.271
Dragon Warrior.

01:17:56.480 --> 01:17:58.596
Oogway? Whoa!

01:18:01.520 --> 01:18:03.112
I can't believe it.

01:18:03.240 --> 01:18:04.639
Whoa!

01:18:04.720 --> 01:18:06.233
You are extra shiny.

01:18:06.400 --> 01:18:07.400
As are you.

01:18:07.560 --> 01:18:09.357
I know, right?
It's like the best cape ever.

01:18:09.520 --> 01:18:11.670
When I run with it,
then it looks really cool.

01:18:11.840 --> 01:18:14.035
It suits you.
You've grown.

01:18:14.200 --> 01:18:16.111
Yep. I gotta lay off
the panda buffet.

01:18:16.280 --> 01:18:18.350
Grown up,

01:18:19.040 --> 01:18:20.553
as I hoped you would

01:18:20.640 --> 01:18:23.279
when I sent the message
to your father.

01:18:23.360 --> 01:18:26.591
You sent
the universe mail. Whoa!

01:18:26.800 --> 01:18:27.800
Yes.

01:18:28.320 --> 01:18:30.993
Because the universe
needed you.

01:18:31.160 --> 01:18:33.037
Me?

01:18:33.520 --> 01:18:37.877
You finally became the panda
you were always meant to be.

01:18:38.040 --> 01:18:40.076
But, how'd you know I could?

01:18:40.240 --> 01:18:42.549
On the first day we met,

01:18:42.720 --> 01:18:46.030
I saw the future of kung fu.

01:18:48.680 --> 01:18:50.511
<i>And the past.</i>

01:18:53.120 --> 01:18:56.749
<i>I saw the panda
who could unite them both.</i>

01:18:57.440 --> 01:18:59.749
<i>That is why I chose you, Po.</i>

01:19:00.440 --> 01:19:03.477
Both sides of a Yin and Yang.

01:19:04.640 --> 01:19:08.474
And my true successor.

01:19:10.560 --> 01:19:13.120
Me? I can't take that.

01:19:13.280 --> 01:19:14.713
Just take it.

01:19:14.800 --> 01:19:16.358
I have a bigger one.

01:19:18.240 --> 01:19:21.550
I mean, you're enlightened
and everything. I'm just...

01:19:21.640 --> 01:19:23.949
Oh!

01:19:24.040 --> 01:19:25.040
Really?

01:19:25.200 --> 01:19:26.599
Yes.

01:19:36.880 --> 01:19:38.233
Now what do we do?

01:19:38.360 --> 01:19:40.510
Hmm. You tell me.

01:19:41.600 --> 01:19:43.431
No. Oogway, don't go!

01:19:43.600 --> 01:19:47.070
I'm not going anywhere.
I live here.

01:19:47.240 --> 01:19:48.559
Oh, right.

01:19:49.720 --> 01:19:53.633
It's you who must decide
whether to stay or go.

01:19:53.800 --> 01:19:55.677
Wait. I can go back?

01:19:55.840 --> 01:19:58.832
Who knows?
I've never tried.

01:20:13.400 --> 01:20:14.400
Wow!

01:20:25.520 --> 01:20:27.431
Po!
Oh!

01:20:27.680 --> 01:20:29.511
You can fly! Oh!

01:20:35.320 --> 01:20:36.799
Dad. Dad.

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:38.000
Dads!

01:20:38.200 --> 01:20:39.235
Son!

01:20:42.280 --> 01:20:45.078
Don't you go disappearing
in petals ever again.

01:20:45.240 --> 01:20:46.832
We thought we lost you.

01:20:47.120 --> 01:20:48.917
No, you saved me.

01:20:49.840 --> 01:20:50.840
You all did.

01:20:53.080 --> 01:20:54.957
Now, come on over here!

01:20:55.120 --> 01:20:56.838
Hugs!

01:21:00.480 --> 01:21:01.799
Master Shifu!

01:21:02.160 --> 01:21:05.118
The student has
truly become the tea...

01:21:05.200 --> 01:21:06.519
Wait. Where did
you get that?

01:21:06.680 --> 01:21:09.831
Oh, this. Oogway gave it
to me in the Spirit Realm.

01:21:10.240 --> 01:21:12.151
Oh... Of course he did.

01:21:12.320 --> 01:21:14.276
I think I mastered chi.

01:21:16.360 --> 01:21:18.112
Of course you did.

01:21:19.240 --> 01:21:21.470
Can you teach me?

01:21:24.560 --> 01:21:25.754
Ready!

01:21:46.400 --> 01:21:47.469
Whoa!

01:21:49.800 --> 01:21:50.800
Ow!

01:21:54.120 --> 01:21:55.678
Monkey, help me!

01:21:55.840 --> 01:21:57.273
Greeny Baby!

01:21:57.440 --> 01:21:58.440
Get 'em off me!

01:22:04.600 --> 01:22:06.909
Mmm! Hello.

01:22:17.440 --> 01:22:18.668
Skadoosh.

01:22:25.200 --> 01:22:28.237
Panda asthma.

01:23:18.760 --> 01:23:20.955
<i>Everybody was kung fu fighting</i>

01:23:22.960 --> 01:23:25.872
<i>Our chi is what we're finding</i>

01:23:27.160 --> 01:23:29.993
<i>I know it's
a little bit frightening</i>

01:23:31.120 --> 01:23:34.317
<i>Oh, but it's so enlightening</i>

01:23:35.920 --> 01:23:39.959
<i>Before the battle of the fist
comes the battle of the mind</i>

01:23:40.160 --> 01:23:43.869
<i>When you don't know who you are,
just look inside</i>

01:23:44.360 --> 01:23:48.069
<i>When we move into the flow,
we're always gonna win</i>

01:23:48.960 --> 01:23:52.236
<i>So feel the power
and let it in</i>

01:23:52.400 --> 01:23:54.436
<i>Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh</i>

01:23:56.040 --> 01:23:58.508
<i>Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh</i>
