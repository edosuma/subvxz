00:05.609 --> 00:08.244
<i>Kids, Barney and Robin's</i>
<i>wedding turned out</i>

00:08.246 --> 00:10.613
<i>to be a life-changing weekend</i>
<i>for all of us.</i>

00:10.615 --> 00:12.465
<i>Well, not just us.</i>

00:12.467 --> 00:14.200
One ticket to Farhampton,
please.

00:14.202 --> 00:16.001
<i>But I'll get to that.</i>

00:17.339 --> 00:19.722
Who are you honking at?
You.

00:19.724 --> 00:21.674
You're going 40 in a 65.

00:21.676 --> 00:23.793
Pick it up, Grandma!

00:23.795 --> 00:25.845
Look, I'm happy to rock it up
into the 50s,

00:25.847 --> 00:29.565
but I'm gonna need a hand...
or two.

00:29.567 --> 00:31.718
Oh, no. Not the driving gloves.

00:31.720 --> 00:33.386
In 99.9% of highway accidents,

00:33.388 --> 00:35.722
the driver was not
wearing gloves.

00:35.724 --> 00:36.773
Because they're stupid.

00:36.775 --> 00:38.474
They don't help you
drive better.

00:38.476 --> 00:40.143
That's why no one wears them.

00:40.145 --> 00:43.429
Then why is it called...
the glove compartment?

00:43.431 --> 00:45.531
I am not
having this argument again.

00:45.533 --> 00:48.434
Now, as you know, a Mosby
road trip is not only safe,

00:48.436 --> 00:49.385
but informative.

00:49.387 --> 00:51.521
Chiggedy-check it.

00:51.523 --> 00:53.489
<i>Manhattan to Farhampton:</i>

00:53.491 --> 00:56.909
<i>Lil' and Ted's</i>
<i>Excellent Adventure?</i>

00:56.911 --> 00:58.745
That baby's stuffed to the rings
with fun facts

00:58.747 --> 01:01.047
about our unsung neighbor
to the east-- Long Island.

01:01.049 --> 01:03.466
For instance, just up
ahead, the historic

01:03.468 --> 01:05.668
childhood home of
Florian van Otterloop,

01:05.670 --> 01:06.886
the Dutch bucklesmith

01:06.888 --> 01:08.888
who revolutionized
the belt industry.

01:08.890 --> 01:10.923
Uh, fun story
about that color-blind genius.

01:10.925 --> 01:12.458
When he...
Please stop!

01:12.460 --> 01:15.061
Well, I was just gonna
slow down for pictures,

01:15.063 --> 01:18.398
but that level of enthusiasm
can't go unrewarded.

Hmm.

Oh, look at my
little cousins

01:39.504 --> 01:41.354
in their flower
girl dresses.

01:41.356 --> 01:43.690
Aw, they'll look so cute
next to the ring bear.

01:43.692 --> 01:44.841
Yeah.

01:44.843 --> 01:48.127
Wait, you said
ring <i>bear-er,</i> right?

01:48.129 --> 01:49.962
Ring bear.

01:49.964 --> 01:51.581
Ring <i>bear-er.</i>

01:51.583 --> 01:53.332
Ring bear.

01:53.334 --> 01:55.468
Are you planning
some crazy stunt

01:55.470 --> 01:57.970
with a dangerous wild animal
at our wedding?

01:57.972 --> 01:59.188
Because...

01:59.190 --> 02:00.723
Oh, oh, sorry,
sorry, sorry, sorry.

02:00.725 --> 02:02.058
Oh, boy.

02:02.060 --> 02:03.226
My brother wants to know

02:03.228 --> 02:05.778
what time he "goes on"
at the reception.

02:05.780 --> 02:07.113
What does that mean?

02:07.115 --> 02:11.434
Every wedding he attends,
James insists on... performing.

02:11.436 --> 02:13.519
♪ Islands in the stream

02:13.521 --> 02:15.621

02:36.094 --> 02:39.078
I have invited Scherbatskys
from all over Canada,

02:39.080 --> 02:40.513
and they are Canuckin' nuts.

02:40.515 --> 02:42.849
Like my cousin Ruth
from the Yukon.

02:42.851 --> 02:45.351
I don't like to encourage
Canadian stereotypes,

02:45.353 --> 02:48.604
but that woman
practically rides a moose.

02:50.224 --> 02:51.657
Does she actually ride a moose?

02:51.659 --> 02:52.692
Yeah.

02:52.694 --> 02:54.110
And, uh,

02:54.112 --> 02:56.312
I'm worried she'll bring it
to the wedding.

02:56.314 --> 03:00.333
She and the moose are...
very close.

03:01.385 --> 03:03.102
Whoa.

03:03.104 --> 03:06.489
Every wedding's got a wild card,
but we've invited a whole set.

03:15.232 --> 03:17.366
Someone is gonna
ruin this wedding.

03:17.368 --> 03:21.370
It's just a question
of... who.

03:21.372 --> 03:24.123
I'm gonna ruin this wedding!

03:24.125 --> 03:25.641
My wife is
gonna kill me!

03:25.643 --> 03:27.760
Flight attendants
prepare for departure.

03:27.762 --> 03:30.163
We were gonna move to
Italy for her dream job,

03:30.165 --> 03:32.431
so I brought my son
here to Minnesota

03:32.433 --> 03:34.934
to see my mom
before we left.

03:36.403 --> 03:38.805
And then I got offered
a job as a judge

03:38.807 --> 03:41.324
in New York City,
which is my dream.

03:42.559 --> 03:44.210
But that'll totally
destroy her dream!

03:44.212 --> 03:46.746
You are destroying
a lot of dreams right now.

03:56.975 --> 03:59.091
Wait.

03:59.093 --> 04:01.260
If I got this...

04:08.853 --> 04:10.069
Aren't you gonna
check that?

04:10.071 --> 04:11.571
No.

04:11.573 --> 04:13.639
It-It's just another
obnoxious update

04:13.641 --> 04:14.657
from Marshall's mom.

04:14.659 --> 04:15.658
She's been posting

04:15.660 --> 04:18.327
these "cute" baby pics
of Marvin,

04:18.329 --> 04:20.829
but it's all just propaganda.

04:20.832 --> 04:22.832
First, it was
"Don't move to Italy."

04:23.867 --> 04:26.302
Followed by an extremely subtle
<i>guilt trip.</i>

04:29.039 --> 04:32.074
<i>And then, randomly preachy.</i>

04:32.076 --> 04:33.426
Nah, not looking.

04:33.428 --> 04:34.977
It's just gonna piss me off.

04:34.979 --> 04:36.712
Why are we exiting again?

04:36.714 --> 04:38.047
Well, if you turn in your binder

04:38.049 --> 04:39.849
to the section labeled
"Mennonite Windmills..."

04:39.851 --> 04:41.300
Get back on the expressway now.

04:42.353 --> 04:45.104
The expressway's
for gloveless amateurs.

04:45.106 --> 04:46.389
I'm done.

04:46.391 --> 04:48.040
There's a train station
coming up; just drop me off.

04:48.042 --> 04:50.192
Okay, but some newfangled
train's not gonna stop

04:50.194 --> 04:52.428
at the 40-foot-tall
butter churn in Ronkonkoma!

04:52.430 --> 04:55.848
Yes, but unlike any of
your 18th-century stops,

04:55.850 --> 04:59.184
at least the train will have
a 21st-century toilet!

04:59.186 --> 05:00.820
You're a 21st-century toilet!

05:01.823 --> 05:02.788
Train now!

05:02.790 --> 05:04.624
Fine!

05:04.626 --> 05:07.710
Okay, so far,
I've got 12 wild cards,

05:07.712 --> 05:09.028
not counting the ring bear.

05:09.030 --> 05:10.129
Ring bear-er.

05:10.131 --> 05:11.447
Oh, oh, here's another one.

05:11.449 --> 05:13.866
You know how I found out
that I'm one-quarter Canadian

05:13.868 --> 05:15.217
but I've completely
blocked that out

05:15.219 --> 05:16.819
because your nation's ridiculous
and I'm awesome?

05:16.821 --> 05:17.887
Sure.

05:17.889 --> 05:20.039
Well, turns out,
I have a crazy cousin Mitch

05:20.041 --> 05:21.390
on that side of the family.

05:21.392 --> 05:22.341
That's funny.

05:22.343 --> 05:24.043
I have a crazy
cousin Mitch, too.

05:24.045 --> 05:26.012
But I guarantee
he is crazier than yours.

05:26.014 --> 05:28.514
He built his own house
from timber he chopped down

05:28.516 --> 05:30.149
from other people's houses.

05:30.151 --> 05:31.601
That's funny.

05:31.603 --> 05:33.269
My cousin Mitch
is a lumberjack.

05:33.271 --> 05:35.905
Except mine has six fingers.

05:35.907 --> 05:37.156
On one hand or total?

05:37.158 --> 05:38.524
Total.

05:39.326 --> 05:41.310
Are truckers always
beating him up?

05:41.312 --> 05:43.195
Yes, because he has to...

05:43.197 --> 05:44.330
...hitchhike
with his middle finger.

05:44.332 --> 05:46.983
Wait.

05:46.985 --> 05:49.585
Is it possible that we're...

05:51.404 --> 05:54.624
Could... c-could...
could we be...?

05:54.626 --> 05:56.125
Shh...

05:58.929 --> 06:01.597
Ranjit, could you be a dear
and pull over for a second?

06:01.599 --> 06:04.249
Pulling over!

06:11.192 --> 06:12.808
All right, train.

06:12.810 --> 06:16.028
Let's show your critics you're
not just a Dumpster on wheels

06:16.030 --> 06:17.596
full of drunk idiots.

06:17.598 --> 06:19.882
We're being held at this station

06:19.884 --> 06:21.350
until further notice.

06:21.352 --> 06:23.569
I got to sober up.

06:35.011 --> 06:37.177
Eriksen residence,
Judy speaking.

06:37.179 --> 06:38.729
Why did you post
that judge photo?

06:38.731 --> 06:40.314
Because I'm guilty...

06:40.316 --> 06:43.467
of being one proud mama!

06:43.469 --> 06:45.185
Lily doesn't know
that I took the job,

06:45.187 --> 06:46.820
so if she sees it,
I'm dead.

06:46.822 --> 06:47.921
Just take it down, okay?

06:47.923 --> 06:48.956
Fine.

06:48.958 --> 06:51.542
Let me just get on the online

06:51.544 --> 06:52.976
so I can Internet.

06:52.978 --> 06:55.579
I love the lingo!

06:57.550 --> 06:59.116
Look, Mom,
just-just...

06:59.118 --> 07:01.001
click on the photo
on your wall,

07:01.003 --> 07:03.871
and then under "menu""
click on "options""

07:03.873 --> 07:06.373
Some kind of advertisement
popped on.

07:06.375 --> 07:07.841
Oh, my.

07:07.843 --> 07:10.461
That appears to be pornography.

07:10.463 --> 07:12.563
Just click
on "options""

07:12.565 --> 07:15.099
It's men with other men.

07:15.101 --> 07:16.266
Just click on "options"!

07:16.268 --> 07:17.334
Excuse me!

07:17.336 --> 07:19.119
Are there any other seats
left on this plane?

07:19.121 --> 07:20.120
No.

07:20.122 --> 07:21.388
Hell, I've been
going to Pilates.

07:21.390 --> 07:23.524
I can just hang on
to the landing gear like this.

07:23.526 --> 07:24.541
Sorry, ma'am.

07:24.543 --> 07:26.527
I only signed up for Pilates,

07:26.529 --> 07:29.196
I haven't actually
started going yet.

07:29.198 --> 07:31.281
I didn't sign up.

07:33.151 --> 07:34.535
<i>No, I'm not looking.</i>

07:34.537 --> 07:37.571
<i>I don't need to see</i>
<i>my child used against me.</i>

07:37.573 --> 07:41.542
<i>My sweet, beautiful child</i>
<i>who I haven't seen in a week...</i>

07:41.544 --> 07:45.295
<i>whose head smells like love</i>
<i>and unicorn teardrops,</i>

07:45.297 --> 07:47.364
<i>and why are trains</i>
<i>so lonely?!</i>

07:47.366 --> 07:48.382
<i>Damn it, I'm looking!</i>

07:48.384 --> 07:49.666
Hey, are you okay?

07:49.668 --> 07:51.385
You look stressed.

07:51.387 --> 07:52.469
Plus, you muttered

07:52.471 --> 07:53.720
a few words out loud.

07:53.722 --> 07:55.705
I heard "lonely" and "unicorn,"

07:55.707 --> 07:57.341
which actually gave me
a great idea

07:57.343 --> 07:59.876
for a children's book,
so thank you.

07:59.878 --> 08:01.545
Are you okay?

08:01.547 --> 08:03.063
No.

08:03.065 --> 08:04.982
But there's nothing you can do.

08:04.984 --> 08:06.066
Do you want a cookie?

08:06.068 --> 08:07.717
Yes.

08:07.719 --> 08:08.902
Yes, I do.

08:08.904 --> 08:10.154
Wow.

08:10.156 --> 08:11.355
You just took a cookie

08:11.357 --> 08:12.990
from a complete stranger
on a train.

08:12.992 --> 08:14.191
I like how trusting you are.

08:14.193 --> 08:16.160
There could be drugs
or poison in there.

08:16.162 --> 08:17.811
But there's not, is there?

08:17.813 --> 08:19.229
No idea,
I found them under my seat.

08:19.231 --> 08:20.447
No!

08:20.449 --> 08:21.748
Kidding! Sorry!

08:21.750 --> 08:23.951
You looked stressed, so I
thought you could use a cookie,

08:23.953 --> 08:25.586
then I thought
you could use a joke.

08:25.588 --> 08:27.254
I should have stopped
at the cookie.

08:27.256 --> 08:28.288
You know what?

08:28.290 --> 08:30.207
I don't care
if these are poisoned.

08:30.209 --> 08:31.842
There's chocolate
and peanut butter

08:31.844 --> 08:33.510
and caramel in these sumbitches.

08:33.511 --> 08:35.912
I call them "Sumbitches"!

08:36.932 --> 08:38.048
<i>And that's how Lily</i>

08:38.049 --> 08:39.749
<i>met your mother.</i>

08:40.585 --> 08:42.919
Are Cousin Mitch and I
directly related?

08:42.921 --> 08:44.438
No, Mom, I'm asking

08:44.440 --> 08:46.523
is Cousin Mitch
a blood relative?

08:46.525 --> 08:47.891
I'm not asking
about Cousin Pete,

08:47.893 --> 08:49.276
I'm asking about Cousin Robin!

08:49.278 --> 08:50.310
Mitch!

08:50.312 --> 08:51.395
Cousin Mitch!

08:51.397 --> 08:52.696
Well, just find out
from Uncle Frank

08:52.698 --> 08:53.697
and call me back!

08:53.699 --> 08:55.399
Well, then, go
visit Cousin Cecil

08:55.401 --> 08:57.568
at his sky-diving school
and ask him!

08:57.570 --> 09:00.287
Oh, God, he did?

09:01.222 --> 09:02.489
Well, I guess that can happen

09:02.491 --> 09:04.074
no matter
how experienced you are.

09:04.076 --> 09:05.959
I'm so sorry.

09:09.331 --> 09:10.497
got fired.

09:10.499 --> 09:11.781
Oh.

09:11.783 --> 09:16.978
That's a relief.

09:16.980 --> 09:19.764
Um... I'm so sorry
for your loss.

09:20.533 --> 09:24.035
It may be <i>our</i> loss.

09:25.939 --> 09:27.972
Just click
on "options"!

09:27.974 --> 09:31.042
All I see is a man
holding a bratwurst!

09:31.044 --> 09:32.276
Oh.

09:32.278 --> 09:34.913
No, the pornography's back.

09:34.915 --> 09:36.948
I said, please turn off
all electronic devices.

09:38.084 --> 09:39.634
Oh.

09:39.636 --> 09:41.970
This isn't an
electronic device.

09:41.972 --> 09:43.788
This is actually a toy.

09:43.790 --> 09:45.623
For my son.

09:46.459 --> 09:48.009
We call it Phone-y.

09:48.011 --> 09:49.894
I call you phony.

09:49.896 --> 09:53.131
We can't take off
till you hang up.

09:53.133 --> 09:54.933
Okay, enough.
Give me that phone!

09:54.935 --> 09:56.284
Just click
on "options""

09:56.286 --> 09:57.802
I don't see it!

09:57.804 --> 09:59.687
I said,
give me the phone!

09:59.689 --> 10:00.972
Just click
on "options"!

10:00.974 --> 10:02.524
Stop yelling at me!

10:02.526 --> 10:03.825
Just click
on "options""

10:03.827 --> 10:04.742
Give me the phone.

10:04.744 --> 10:05.944
Click on "options"!

10:05.946 --> 10:08.046
Click on...
I have a baby!

10:08.048 --> 10:10.148
Please, I-I have to get
to New York.

10:10.150 --> 10:11.833
Yeah, well, you should
have thought about that

10:11.835 --> 10:12.867
before you attacked me.

10:12.869 --> 10:14.252
All right, boys,
you got this?

10:14.254 --> 10:15.537
Good.

10:15.539 --> 10:17.505
Let's get this bird in the air.
Ah, you're both

10:17.507 --> 10:19.007
banned from this flight.

10:20.910 --> 10:23.795
So I was driving with my
friend, who thinks he's

10:23.797 --> 10:25.463
"The Road Trip Master."

10:25.465 --> 10:28.349
He has leather driving gloves.

10:28.351 --> 10:29.884
Who wears those?

10:29.886 --> 10:32.187
Huge dorks, that's who.

10:32.189 --> 10:33.438
<i>Your mother was lying.</i>

10:33.440 --> 10:35.607
<i>She had her own pair.</i>

10:35.609 --> 10:36.858
And he always makes us stop

10:36.860 --> 10:39.811
to see some weird
roadside attraction

10:39.813 --> 10:43.181
no one except him
gives a crap about.

10:43.183 --> 10:44.549
Nerd alert.

10:44.551 --> 10:46.417
<i>Kids, you remember</i>
<i>the seven-hour detour</i>

10:46.419 --> 10:47.952
<i>on our road trip</i>
<i>to Disney World</i>

10:47.954 --> 10:50.855
<i>so your mother didn't miss</i>
<i>that goat in South Carolina</i>

10:50.857 --> 10:52.407
<i>who could blow smoke rings.</i>

10:52.409 --> 10:56.861
And he won't go one mile an hour
over the speed limit.

10:56.863 --> 10:58.329
That would drive me crazy.

10:58.331 --> 11:01.416
I would give him
a humiliating nickname

11:01.418 --> 11:04.035
until he stopped driving
like a little girl.

11:04.037 --> 11:06.771
It was "Lady Tedwina Slowsby."

11:06.773 --> 11:09.290
<i>And it worked.</i>

11:09.292 --> 11:12.844
Okay, look, if it's
true, if we are...

11:14.214 --> 11:15.597
You know.

11:15.599 --> 11:17.065
It's really not that big a deal.

11:17.067 --> 11:18.816
Okay, we-we know
we won't have kids.

11:18.818 --> 11:20.151
And even if we did,

11:20.153 --> 11:22.070
King Joffrey's parents
were brother and sister,

11:22.072 --> 11:23.738
and he was
a fair and wise leader.

11:23.740 --> 11:26.441
Yeah. Look, no one
ever needs to know but us.

11:26.443 --> 11:27.075
Exactly.

11:28.245 --> 11:29.527
I know.

11:30.779 --> 11:34.566
<i>We might have to...</i>

11:34.568 --> 11:36.734
<i>Take care of Ranjit.</i>

11:36.736 --> 11:38.753
<i>Hey, you just finished my...</i>

11:38.755 --> 11:40.922
<i>Creepy telepathic</i>
<i>murder thought.</i>

11:40.924 --> 11:44.209
<i>Oh, it must be</i>
<i>a soul mate thing.</i>

11:44.211 --> 11:45.576
<i>Unless...</i>

11:45.578 --> 11:49.097
<i>it's a weird cousin thing.</i>

11:50.750 --> 11:53.384
So we'll be good
either way, right?

11:53.386 --> 11:54.919
Honey?

11:54.921 --> 11:58.606
That's right... sweetie.

11:58.608 --> 12:00.858
Now, get over here, you.

12:00.860 --> 12:04.562
Gah, just try
and stop me.

12:16.775 --> 12:17.909
Aw.
Ooh, ooh.

12:17.911 --> 12:19.777
Ooh, mmm, mmm, mmm.

12:19.779 --> 12:21.445
Well, I can't wait
till tonight.

12:21.447 --> 12:22.613
I have got some

12:22.615 --> 12:23.915
naughty-naughty-naughty
things planned.

12:23.917 --> 12:25.049
Aw.

12:25.051 --> 12:27.669
Oh, wow, you have certainly
piqued my incest.

12:27.671 --> 12:29.053
Interest. Interest!

12:31.307 --> 12:34.425
I still can't believe he dragged
me to the childhood home

12:34.427 --> 12:37.712
of some stupid bucklesmith
no one's ever even heard of.

12:37.714 --> 12:40.148
Yeah, who cares
about Florian van Otterloop?

12:40.150 --> 12:42.400
I never told you his name.

12:42.402 --> 12:43.718
Sumbitch?

12:43.720 --> 12:46.604
I mean, why'd he have to
act that way?

12:46.606 --> 12:49.424
He knows I hate
how he gets on road trips.

12:49.426 --> 12:52.476
It almost seems like
he wanted you to storm off.

12:52.478 --> 12:54.329
But we're going
to the same place.

12:54.331 --> 12:57.282
There's no reason
why he'd want to ditch me.

12:57.284 --> 12:59.617
<i>And suddenly Lily remembered</i>
<i>that a week ago,</i>

12:59.619 --> 13:02.220
<i>I'd helped Robin look</i>
<i>for her long-lost locket.</i>

13:02.222 --> 13:04.488
<i>But it was gone.</i>

13:08.377 --> 13:10.511
<i>Then Lily told me</i>
<i>the locket actually got stashed</i>

13:10.513 --> 13:13.214
<i>in my pencil box,</i>
<i>but when I opened it...</i>

13:13.216 --> 13:15.500
<i>the locket wasn't there.</i>

13:15.502 --> 13:16.801
Good.

13:16.803 --> 13:17.969
'Cause that locket's trouble.

13:17.971 --> 13:19.137
How? It's-it's just a friendly,

13:19.139 --> 13:20.254
innocent wedding gift.

13:20.256 --> 13:21.255
It's not innocent.

13:21.257 --> 13:22.940
Ted, you think

13:22.942 --> 13:26.177
if you can get that locket
for Robin you'll win her back.

13:26.179 --> 13:29.047
Lily, I've let it go.

13:33.869 --> 13:35.536
I mean...
What?

13:35.538 --> 13:37.021
There's, like,
a one percent chance

13:37.023 --> 13:39.457
that Stella has the locket
from when we lived together.

13:39.459 --> 13:41.726
Promise me you didn't call
the woman who left you

13:41.728 --> 13:44.946
at the altar so that
you could find that locket.

13:44.948 --> 13:46.164
Of course not.

13:46.166 --> 13:47.382
I e-mailed her.

13:47.384 --> 13:48.466
Ted.

13:48.468 --> 13:49.717
But Stella's living
in L.A. now.

13:49.719 --> 13:50.718
And even if she has it,

13:50.720 --> 13:52.053
it's buried
in some storage unit.

13:52.055 --> 13:53.554
She said I'd have
to fly out there

13:53.556 --> 13:55.173
and look for it myself.

13:55.175 --> 13:57.541
Promise me you aren't
about to do that.

13:57.543 --> 13:59.310
I promise.

14:00.062 --> 14:01.646
Sumbitch!

14:16.036 --> 14:18.851
You better hope when Sweaty
finally gets off that phone,

14:18.852 --> 14:21.103
he can get me on the next flight
to New York.

14:21.105 --> 14:23.288
I got the password
from my mom.

14:23.290 --> 14:24.856
I'm gonna take that
photo down myself.

14:24.858 --> 14:26.908
You know, I don't give
a damn about your photo.

14:26.910 --> 14:29.394
My daughter is giving
a big speech for the Model U.N.

14:29.396 --> 14:31.997
at her school, and I'm
gonna miss it because of you.

14:34.802 --> 14:37.335
Her father and I are separated.

14:37.337 --> 14:38.787
She lives with her dad.

14:39.639 --> 14:41.923
And if I don't make it...

14:41.925 --> 14:44.876
she's never gonna
trust me again.

14:44.878 --> 14:46.995
I'm so sorry.

14:46.997 --> 14:48.814
Wow, that worked on you?

14:48.816 --> 14:51.516
Let's hope Pit Stains is
as dumb as you are.

14:51.518 --> 14:53.235
What? Why is this
so hard for my mom?

14:53.237 --> 14:54.269
All you do

14:54.271 --> 14:55.904
is you click the photo,

14:55.906 --> 14:57.939
and then you click on the...

14:57.941 --> 15:00.642
I don't see...
I don't see "options."

15:00.644 --> 15:03.028
Just click on "options."

15:03.030 --> 15:03.945
But where is it?

15:03.947 --> 15:05.063
Just click on "options."

15:05.065 --> 15:06.281
Is it up on the toolbar?

15:06.283 --> 15:08.283
Just click on "options."
It's not there!

15:08.285 --> 15:11.536
Just click on "options"!

15:15.075 --> 15:16.591
Hi, Grandma.

15:16.593 --> 15:19.177
You-you can explain how
Cousin Mitch is related to us?

15:19.179 --> 15:21.146
Explain, Grandma, explain!

15:21.148 --> 15:22.964
Okay, he married
Barney's dad's cousin Renee,

15:22.966 --> 15:24.549
who he met selling Vachon cakes

15:24.551 --> 15:26.968
outside a curling bonspiel
in Chicoutimi.

15:26.970 --> 15:28.303
English, Grandma, English!

15:28.305 --> 15:30.939
And on our side of the family,
he was adopted

15:30.941 --> 15:32.774
because his real parents
were eaten alive

15:32.776 --> 15:33.859
by their sled dogs?

15:33.861 --> 15:36.094
That's awesome!
Thanks, Grandma.

15:38.215 --> 15:39.531
So...

15:39.533 --> 15:42.267
So you and I share
no DNA whatsoever.

15:42.269 --> 15:44.369
Let's change that.

15:46.039 --> 15:47.622
Don't hold back.

15:47.624 --> 15:50.208
This divider is
totally soundproof.

15:50.210 --> 15:53.545
Go all the way.

15:53.547 --> 15:55.130
Wait till the hotel?

15:55.132 --> 15:56.047
Totally.

15:56.916 --> 15:58.300
Hey, you know what?

15:58.302 --> 16:01.136
I'm not worried about a wild
card at our wedding anymore.

16:01.138 --> 16:03.672
Whether it's Uncle Vic
or Aunt Shelly

16:03.674 --> 16:04.723
or the ring bear.

16:04.725 --> 16:06.308
Ring bear-er. Er.

16:06.310 --> 16:08.593
Whether any
of those mammals go rogue,

16:08.595 --> 16:12.514
our wedding is
gonna be legendary.

16:13.316 --> 16:14.900
No "wait for it"?

16:14.902 --> 16:17.235
I've got you.

16:17.237 --> 16:20.155
I don't have to
wait for it anymore.

16:34.605 --> 16:35.921
It's a long story,

16:35.923 --> 16:38.173
but if we don't beat my friend
out to that wedding,

16:38.175 --> 16:39.341
it's gonna be bad.

16:39.343 --> 16:41.960
This is too stressful.
I-I need to see Marvin!

16:41.962 --> 16:44.045
No! You made me promise
not to let you look,

16:44.047 --> 16:45.547
because it's
only gonna upset you.

16:45.549 --> 16:48.717
Here, have another sum... bitch.

16:48.719 --> 16:51.803
No more sumbitches?!

16:51.805 --> 16:53.504
Give me the damn phone!

16:54.925 --> 16:56.925
Just go to "edi""
on the toolbar!

16:56.927 --> 16:58.343
No, "account settings"!

16:58.345 --> 16:59.878
Just click
on "options""

16:59.880 --> 17:01.363
Stop!

17:01.365 --> 17:04.132
It can't be done.

17:04.134 --> 17:07.102
That photo is etched
in eternity.

17:07.104 --> 17:09.654
Long after humanity's
reign has ended,

17:09.656 --> 17:11.689
the only traces
of our civilization found

17:11.691 --> 17:13.358
by Earth's new ape masters
will be

17:13.359 --> 17:15.327
the top
of the Statue of Liberty

17:15.329 --> 17:17.545
and this photo of me
pretending to be

17:17.547 --> 17:21.299
a judge with a banana gavel.

17:21.300 --> 17:23.435
Well, they'll probably like
the banana thing.

17:23.436 --> 17:25.053
The ape masters?

17:26.137 --> 17:27.973
Sorry.
Lily's gonna see it,

17:27.974 --> 17:30.475
and we're gonna have
the biggest fight of our lives.

17:30.477 --> 17:33.895
Oh, I wish I could
see your wife kick your ass.

17:33.897 --> 17:36.398
I don't mean a physical fight.

17:36.400 --> 17:37.465
She's not an animal.

17:37.467 --> 17:39.901
I'm sorry I tried
to bite you.

17:39.903 --> 17:42.487
I'm sorry that I swatted you
on the nose

17:42.489 --> 17:43.738
with a rolled-up magazine.

17:43.740 --> 17:46.341
It's the only way I'll learn.

17:48.594 --> 17:52.497
Look, I haven't seen
my baby in a week.

17:52.499 --> 17:54.565
You know what?

17:54.567 --> 17:56.084
Go for it.

18:05.428 --> 18:06.778
It's gone!

18:06.780 --> 18:08.463
It's gone!

18:08.465 --> 18:09.580
You did it!

18:09.582 --> 18:12.583
You did it!

18:13.769 --> 18:16.271
No new insulting Marvin photo.

18:16.273 --> 18:17.889
Hmm.

18:17.891 --> 18:22.644
No new insulting Marvin photo.

18:22.646 --> 18:25.280
I know I'm just a stranger
on a train

18:25.282 --> 18:29.534
who you tried to bite, but...
do you want a hug?

18:51.591 --> 18:54.426
Lily! What the hell?!

18:57.063 --> 19:00.015
Ted and I had some
road trip issues.

19:00.017 --> 19:01.816
Did he put on the gloves?
Mm-hmm.

19:01.818 --> 19:03.468
That tackle was justified.

19:04.220 --> 19:05.854
What's this?
It's for you.

19:05.856 --> 19:07.856
Don't open it.

19:10.976 --> 19:12.861
With all
the big changes coming up,

19:12.863 --> 19:15.497
I just wanted Robin
to remember her friends.

19:15.499 --> 19:18.366
We all want nothing but
happiness for you and Barney.

19:18.368 --> 19:19.984
Right, Lily?

19:20.870 --> 19:22.754
Right.

19:22.756 --> 19:24.923
Oh, wow.

19:24.925 --> 19:26.291
That was, what, eight years ago?

19:26.293 --> 19:27.325
Yeah.

19:27.327 --> 19:29.461
Eight years.

19:30.296 --> 19:32.380
Thanks, Ted.

19:37.887 --> 19:40.688
I'm gonna...
I'm gonna get checked in.

19:41.557 --> 19:44.476
Marshall's flight just took off.

19:44.478 --> 19:46.177
My boys will be here soon.

19:46.179 --> 19:47.729
Oh, yay.

19:47.731 --> 19:49.948
<i>Actually, Lily's boys were</i>
<i>just learning there was</i>

19:49.950 --> 19:52.801
<i>only one more flight out</i>
<i>to New York with one seat left,</i>

19:52.803 --> 19:55.203
<i>and it was all the way</i>
<i>across the airport.</i>

20:13.539 --> 20:15.673
You're not gonna
tackle me again, are you?

20:15.675 --> 20:16.874
I'm the maid of honor.

20:16.876 --> 20:18.810
There's a good chance
that won't be

20:18.812 --> 20:20.228
my only tackle of the weekend.

20:20.230 --> 20:22.063
<i>It wasn't.</i>

20:22.065 --> 20:24.215
Look, I'm sorry.

20:24.217 --> 20:27.051
I just got it in my head
that you somehow managed

20:27.053 --> 20:28.820
to track down that locket
in Los Angeles,

20:28.822 --> 20:30.905
and now you were gonna
blow up the wedding.

20:30.907 --> 20:32.857
You really think I'm that crazy?

20:33.676 --> 20:36.227
I guess that's fair.

20:36.229 --> 20:40.165
Look, even though I was wrong,
tell me you aren't thinking

20:40.167 --> 20:42.750
about doing anything
insane this weekend.

20:42.752 --> 20:44.702
Of course not.

20:44.704 --> 20:47.322
<i>And all I can say, kids,</i>

20:47.324 --> 20:51.025
<i>is at that moment,</i>
<i>I really thought I meant it.</i>

20:51.317 --> 20:55.219
<i>But the truth is...</i>
<i>you never know</i>

20:55.221 --> 20:57.371
<i>who's gonna be the wild card</i>
<i>at a wedding.</i>

20:58.165 --> 21:01.126
Hi. One ticket
to Los Angeles, please.

21:07.828 --> 21:10.479
<i>That afternoon</i>
<i>at the Farhampton Inn,</i>

21:10.481 --> 21:13.182
<i>Aunt Lily and I</i>
<i>tried to check in.</i>

21:13.184 --> 21:14.350
Are you chewing gum?

21:14.352 --> 21:15.568
You never chew gum.

21:15.570 --> 21:17.469
You shouldn't chew gum
in here.

21:17.471 --> 21:20.189
Nobody cares if
I chew gum, Ted.

21:20.191 --> 21:21.240
Are you chewing gum?

21:21.242 --> 21:23.109
Yes, she is.
She's chewing gum.

21:23.111 --> 21:24.326
Ooh, can I have a piece?

21:24.328 --> 21:26.162
Of course!
Great.

21:26.164 --> 21:27.196
Thank you.

21:27.198 --> 21:28.447
Okay, let's chew some gum

21:28.449 --> 21:30.149
and get you guys
all checked in.

21:30.151 --> 21:32.201
Ms. Aldrin, how many
keys will you need?

21:32.203 --> 21:33.152
Two, please.

21:33.154 --> 21:34.253
My husband's
getting in later.

21:34.255 --> 21:35.838
Excellent, and Mr. Mosby?

21:35.840 --> 21:36.956
Uh, just one, please.

21:36.958 --> 21:40.025
Oh, oh, I-I see.

21:40.027 --> 21:41.961
Oh.

21:41.963 --> 21:43.913
Well, hang in there.

21:43.915 --> 21:45.714
You'll find somebody.

21:45.716 --> 21:48.601
Thank you,
front desk stranger.

21:48.603 --> 21:50.870
I'm sorry, we just... we just
don't get a lot of singles here.

21:50.872 --> 21:51.971
I mean,
look at this place.

21:51.973 --> 21:53.506
It's so romantic.

21:53.508 --> 21:56.942
Countless babies conceived
within these walls.

21:56.944 --> 21:59.361
And one... grisly murder.

21:59.363 --> 22:00.512
Now, are you sure
that you wouldn't

22:00.514 --> 22:03.348
feel more comfortable
staying at a motel?

22:03.350 --> 22:04.533
What? No, look.

22:04.535 --> 22:06.485
I'm not some miserable,
lonely person.

22:06.487 --> 22:07.853
Tell him, Lily.

22:07.855 --> 22:09.455
It's a tough
weekend for him.

22:09.457 --> 22:10.489
Bro.

22:10.491 --> 22:12.158
We're here for a wedding.
Ouch.

22:12.160 --> 22:14.994
And he used to date the bride.
Ooh, mama.

22:14.996 --> 22:16.979
And he's the best man.
Devastating.

22:16.981 --> 22:18.581
Could you please
just check us in?

22:18.583 --> 22:20.216
Oh, your rooms aren't
gonna be ready for hours.

22:20.218 --> 22:21.917
But in the meantime,

22:21.919 --> 22:24.303
Ms. Aldrin, I definitely think

22:24.305 --> 22:26.388
you and your husband should
check out the lighthouse.

22:26.390 --> 22:29.141
It's a beautiful view
of the bay-- so romantic.

22:29.143 --> 22:30.176
Oh, wow.

22:30.178 --> 22:31.760
Here's the channel guide

22:31.762 --> 22:33.479
for the TV.

22:33.481 --> 22:35.714
Don't listen
to him, Ted.

22:35.716 --> 22:38.050
You are not alone.

22:38.052 --> 22:40.903
In fact, this
whole weekend,

22:40.905 --> 22:43.439
it is going to be
nothing but me and...

22:43.441 --> 22:44.824
Marshall!

22:44.826 --> 22:46.008
Oh, thank God,
you're on your way.

22:46.010 --> 22:48.043
If I had to be here alone,
I would kill myself.

22:49.229 --> 22:50.362
How are you doing?

22:50.364 --> 22:52.781
I'm fine... Curtis.

22:52.783 --> 22:54.667
I mean, let's do
the math here.

22:54.669 --> 22:58.787
One "best man" plus one
"no girlfriend" equals...

22:58.789 --> 23:01.540
"Mothers of Farhampton,
lock up your daughters!"

23:01.542 --> 23:03.425
Double guns!

23:10.050 --> 23:11.383
Wow, you're in bad shape.

23:11.385 --> 23:12.601
Marshall missed
his flight.

23:12.603 --> 23:14.270
He might not get
here tonight.

23:14.272 --> 23:16.755
He might not
get here at all.

23:16.757 --> 23:17.940
We...

23:17.942 --> 23:19.913
only have a few
of these left.

23:24.097 --> 23:25.381
Hi...

23:25.383 --> 23:26.398
Linus.

23:26.400 --> 23:28.067
Here's how this goes down.

23:28.069 --> 23:30.569
If I'm going to make it through
this weekend without my husband,

23:30.571 --> 23:32.655
I need you to hook a lady up.

23:32.657 --> 23:35.207
Any time you see me
without a drink in my hand,

23:35.209 --> 23:37.309
you put a drink in my hand.

23:37.311 --> 23:40.379
Are you my guy, Linus?

23:41.231 --> 23:42.548
So you want the Kennedy Package?

23:42.550 --> 23:44.133
Bingo.

23:45.585 --> 23:47.636
Go for Barney.

23:49.122 --> 23:50.339
Ah.

23:50.341 --> 23:52.841
Thank you Linus.

23:52.843 --> 23:54.226
Barney,
before you get too upset,

23:54.228 --> 23:56.445
there's another flight
that leaves in five minutes.

23:56.447 --> 23:58.130
You're getting on it.
I'm gonna try.

23:58.132 --> 23:59.515
There is no try!

23:59.517 --> 24:00.900
You're getting on that plane.

24:00.902 --> 24:02.651
Hey, growth spurt.

24:02.653 --> 24:05.637
If there is only one seat
left on this plane,

24:05.639 --> 24:07.472
I will fight you for it.

24:07.474 --> 24:09.474
And I'm a biter.

24:09.476 --> 24:11.110
Marshall, whoever that is,
grab her carry-on

24:11.112 --> 24:12.644
and throw it
into a restricted area.

24:12.646 --> 24:14.330
I'm serious. Do it.
Do it now.

24:14.332 --> 24:15.831
What? No.

24:15.833 --> 24:16.916
Barney, are you...?

24:16.918 --> 24:18.417
No, I'm not gonna...

24:18.419 --> 24:19.501
That's... No.

24:19.503 --> 24:21.670
There is no
"What, no, Barney, are you,

24:21.672 --> 24:23.706
no I'm not gonna, that's no!"

24:23.708 --> 24:25.824
This is a holiday weekend.

24:25.826 --> 24:28.827
You're not gonna get
to New York by being nice.

24:28.829 --> 24:31.263
So you're gonna have
to lose the whole Midwestern

24:31.265 --> 24:32.831
aw-shucksy-doodles thing...

24:32.833 --> 24:33.882
Shucksy doodles?

24:33.884 --> 24:35.267
...and act like a New Yorker.

24:35.269 --> 24:37.686
A pushy, obnoxious,
knock-the-other-guy-down-

24:37.688 --> 24:40.222
and-take-his-hot-dog resident
of the greatest city on earth!

24:40.224 --> 24:41.774
No can do, Barney.

24:41.776 --> 24:42.942
I'm from Minnesota,

24:42.944 --> 24:45.277
where there's plenty of hot dogs
for everyone.

24:46.780 --> 24:49.348
Perhaps even too many.

24:49.350 --> 24:50.366
But listen,

24:50.368 --> 24:51.951
I'm gonna get to New York

24:51.953 --> 24:53.285
without being a jerk.

24:53.287 --> 24:55.020
Just get to New York!

24:55.022 --> 24:56.021
I'll get to New York!

24:56.023 --> 24:57.606
Nobody's getting to New York.

24:57.608 --> 24:59.024
Not this weekend anyway.

24:59.026 --> 25:01.660
There's a big storm
rolling up the East Coast.

25:01.662 --> 25:03.579
All the airports
are closing.

25:03.581 --> 25:06.365
My advice is
rent a car and drive.

25:06.367 --> 25:07.466
But you better hurry.

25:07.468 --> 25:09.435
They're gonna
run out of cars soon.

25:10.821 --> 25:12.254
Okay, listen.

25:12.256 --> 25:13.589
If we're both
going to New York,

25:13.591 --> 25:16.809
why don't we rent a car,
split the drive?

25:16.811 --> 25:18.594
That seems like
a reasonable plan.

25:18.596 --> 25:20.896
Can I help you with
that diaper bag?

25:20.898 --> 25:23.349
Sure. Thank you.
Oh, it's...

25:25.352 --> 25:28.237
Have a nice bus ride,
pumpkin head!

25:37.831 --> 25:40.532
Hey, lady.

25:40.534 --> 25:42.368
Yeah, you just threw away
your ticket

25:42.370 --> 25:43.869
to a really great road trip.

25:43.871 --> 25:46.205
I'm sorry, I can't hear you.

25:46.207 --> 25:48.340
You're all the way back there,

25:48.342 --> 25:50.575
and I'm all the way
up here.

25:50.577 --> 25:52.878
Oh, you can hear me.

25:52.880 --> 25:55.464
Get ready to be driving
the jealous-mobile

25:55.466 --> 25:57.599
because our car is
gonna have games,

25:57.601 --> 26:00.419
snacks, a James Patterson
audio book

26:00.421 --> 26:04.289
my mother describes as
"cluttering her glove box."

26:04.291 --> 26:07.359
Your car? I'll be in Pittsburgh
before you get your car.

26:07.361 --> 26:09.978
We'll see about that.

26:09.980 --> 26:11.947
And if you're going to New York,
you're not gonna want

26:11.949 --> 26:13.032
to go through Pittsburgh.

26:13.034 --> 26:14.433
94 backs up around Allentown,

26:14.435 --> 26:16.869
so you're gonna want
to stick on 80.

26:16.871 --> 26:18.320
Jerk face!

26:20.373 --> 26:22.607
Come on, universe.

26:22.609 --> 26:24.443
I'm a nice guy.

26:24.445 --> 26:26.078
Send me a miracle.

26:26.080 --> 26:29.548
<i>And then the universe sent</i>
<i>your Uncle Marshall...</i>

26:29.550 --> 26:32.468
<i>Herm.</i>

26:39.959 --> 26:41.977
Okay, people, let's move
it along. What do you want?

26:41.979 --> 26:44.012
You want a car? You got a car.
Beat it.

26:44.014 --> 26:45.347
What kind of car
do you want?

26:45.349 --> 26:47.433
Too slow, you get a minivan.

26:47.435 --> 26:49.802
Next. Ah, midsize sedan.

26:49.804 --> 26:51.153
Incoming. Next.

26:51.155 --> 26:52.921
Yes!
You want a gas option?

26:52.923 --> 26:54.523
Nobody wants a gas option.
Get out of here.

26:54.525 --> 26:55.524
Next.

26:55.526 --> 26:57.776
Hello. I need a car.

26:57.778 --> 27:00.145
You've got it.
That's all of them.

27:00.147 --> 27:02.264
We're all out of cars,
everybody.

27:02.266 --> 27:03.832
Wait, no!

27:03.834 --> 27:05.384
You let this guy beat you?

27:05.386 --> 27:07.086
Ma'am, it's not a race.

27:07.088 --> 27:10.089
That right there
is why you lost.

27:10.857 --> 27:13.208
Maybe this is your fault.

27:13.210 --> 27:14.460
Did you ever think of that?

27:14.462 --> 27:15.711
Maybe if you
had just been

27:15.713 --> 27:18.163
a little bit nicer,
then you would be

27:18.165 --> 27:19.882
the one driving this lovely...

27:19.884 --> 27:21.633
What kind of car is it?

27:21.635 --> 27:24.520

I can't drive that.

I rent the car,

then I go buy the car seat,
come back here,

28:15.222 --> 28:18.223
pick you guys up,
and then the three of us

rent the car,

28:26.567 --> 28:29.535
go and get a baby seat
for my son,

28:29.537 --> 28:33.121
and then drive all the way
back here to pick me up.

28:33.123 --> 28:34.389
That's right.

28:34.391 --> 28:37.459
Well, then you're
gonna need some cash. Here.

28:37.461 --> 28:39.428
Hundred bucks ought to cover it.

28:39.430 --> 28:40.762
So, we'll see
you soon.

28:40.764 --> 28:42.631
You got it, Michael!
Marshall.

28:42.633 --> 28:45.050
Doesn't matter now, does it?

28:48.188 --> 28:50.422
Remember this day, Marvin.

28:51.474 --> 28:54.560
Not only is this the day
that we either saw Prince

28:54.562 --> 28:57.980
or a... a really flamboyantly
dressed greyhound,

28:57.982 --> 29:01.733
it's also the day that your dad
chose not to be a jerk...

29:01.735 --> 29:04.386
and put his trust in humanity.

29:04.388 --> 29:07.122
Just watch where it gets us.

29:10.109 --> 29:12.211
Shucksy-doodles!

29:14.053 --> 29:15.664
<i>Uncle Marshall</i>
<i>was just about ready</i>

29:15.665 --> 29:17.147
<i>to abandon</i>
<i>his faith in humanity.</i>

29:18.221 --> 29:19.838
But let's back up a little bit.

29:19.840 --> 29:24.042
And now the true tale
of the Stinson Curse.

29:24.044 --> 29:27.912
<i>Moscow, 1807.</i>

29:27.914 --> 29:29.981
What a wonderful night
at the opera.

29:29.983 --> 29:31.950
Wouldn't you agree,
Comrade Barnovski?

29:31.952 --> 29:34.402
I would indeed,
Comrade Jamesokoff.

29:34.404 --> 29:37.572
But you know what made it
truly wonderful?

29:37.574 --> 29:40.175
Being here with my wife...

29:40.177 --> 29:43.945
the beet in my borscht,
the fur on my hat,

29:43.947 --> 29:49.033
the only person I've ever
been attracted to, ever.

29:49.035 --> 29:51.219
I feel the same way
about Kyle...

29:51.221 --> 29:53.304
my plutonic friend
from work.

29:55.058 --> 29:58.777
Is it just me, or did that feel
like we hit an old Gypsy woman?

29:58.779 --> 30:00.545
Yep. Old Gypsy woman.

30:00.547 --> 30:03.314
Good call, Barnovski.
Oh, well, she's just a peasant.

30:03.316 --> 30:04.299
Home, Smirnoff.

30:04.301 --> 30:06.717
Wait, she's
saying somethink!

30:08.105 --> 30:09.938
Hornier.

30:11.890 --> 30:13.658
Hornier.

30:14.443 --> 30:15.994
Hornier?

30:15.996 --> 30:17.895
Sonobovich!

30:17.897 --> 30:20.014
Did she just put a curse on us?

30:20.016 --> 30:21.583
Eh, nonsense, brother.

30:21.585 --> 30:24.452
Okay, let's go, Smirnoff.

30:24.454 --> 30:25.670
Smirnoff?

30:26.505 --> 30:29.691
Homina, hominovich. Mmm,

30:29.693 --> 30:34.395
Smirnoff, I would climb you
like the Kremlin Wall.

30:34.397 --> 30:35.913
What's happening to me?

30:35.915 --> 30:38.516
Don't you see?
You're getting hornier, brother,

30:38.518 --> 30:41.136
just like
the old Gypsy woman said!

30:41.138 --> 30:42.504
Oh, hello there.

30:43.806 --> 30:47.642
Ever had
a White Russian?

30:50.446 --> 30:52.763
<i>For the next 200 years,</i>

30:52.765 --> 30:55.433
<i>every male member</i>
<i>of the Stinson family</i>

30:55.435 --> 30:58.536
<i>was afflicted</i>
<i>by the Gypsy's curse,</i>

30:58.538 --> 31:00.104
<i>an unquenchable thirst</i>
<i>for booty</i>

31:00.106 --> 31:04.259
that no committed relationship
<i>could ever satisfy.</i>

31:04.261 --> 31:06.544
That is, until my brother James

31:06.546 --> 31:08.480
met his husband Tom.

31:08.482 --> 31:11.449
The day they got married,
they lifted the curse forever,

31:11.451 --> 31:13.384
freeing me from the shackles

31:13.386 --> 31:15.587
of having sex
with lots of different women.

31:15.589 --> 31:16.588
Although, sometimes

31:16.590 --> 31:18.389
Robin and I still use
the shackles.

31:18.391 --> 31:19.340
Bondage five!

31:19.342 --> 31:21.059
Whoa.
I can't, I can't,

31:21.061 --> 31:21.976
I can't.

31:21.978 --> 31:24.095
Go for Barney!

31:25.130 --> 31:26.781
Ah.

31:26.783 --> 31:30.185
Thank you, Linus.

31:30.187 --> 31:31.769
This is worse
than I thought.

31:31.771 --> 31:33.638
I know.
Showtime, no HBO?

31:33.640 --> 31:35.106
No.

31:36.141 --> 31:38.493
Tom and I are getting divorced.

31:38.495 --> 31:39.794
- What?
- What?

31:39.796 --> 31:42.163
That's why you look
extra handsome.

31:42.165 --> 31:44.082
I do get extra hot
when I'm single.

31:44.084 --> 31:45.099
Your skin looks amazing.

31:45.101 --> 31:46.417
Looks amazing.
I know.

31:46.419 --> 31:48.753
So... so what happened?
Why-why'd you guys break up?

31:48.755 --> 31:50.338
Well, the thing to remember

31:50.340 --> 31:51.873
is that when something
like this happens,

31:51.875 --> 31:52.891
it's nobody's fault.

31:52.893 --> 31:55.026
You cheated on him.
Repeatedly.

31:56.045 --> 31:57.345
I thought about
keeping it quiet,

31:57.347 --> 32:00.465
but then I realized,
wouldn't my family want me

32:00.467 --> 32:04.052
to be honest with them
about news this big?

32:04.054 --> 32:07.522
Oh, can I just say five things?

32:09.291 --> 32:12.777
What is the matter with--
sorry, six-- you?!

32:12.779 --> 32:14.629
Ooh! What?!

32:14.631 --> 32:17.365
I'm-I'm sorry
about you and Tom,

32:17.367 --> 32:19.784
but you can't just drop
a bombshell like this

32:19.786 --> 32:21.302
so close to
someone's wedding.

32:21.304 --> 32:23.972
You broke the curse.
You and Tom

32:23.974 --> 32:25.073
are the only couple

32:25.075 --> 32:26.741
that makes Barney
believe in marriage.

32:26.743 --> 32:29.077
Really?
The only couple?

32:29.079 --> 32:32.297
I mean, no one else
comes to mind?

32:32.299 --> 32:34.132
Been together 17 years?

32:34.134 --> 32:36.867
She's a spunky redhead,
he's got calves

32:36.869 --> 32:39.387
that launched a thousand
lady boners?

32:39.389 --> 32:40.588
Hey, sorry about that.

32:40.590 --> 32:41.923
Hey, did you guys know

32:41.925 --> 32:45.510
that Sunday is James' and Tom's
anniversary?

32:45.512 --> 32:47.545
How cool is that?

32:47.547 --> 32:48.680
We're anniversary bros!

32:48.682 --> 32:50.548
Every year, we should go out
and celebrate...

32:50.550 --> 32:51.849
just the two of us.

32:51.851 --> 32:53.785
Listen, bro, you...

32:53.787 --> 32:56.104
I know, I know, "Please, Barney,

32:56.106 --> 32:59.357
you don't have to get us
an anniversary gift this year."

32:59.359 --> 33:00.592
You get them an
anniversary gift?

33:00.594 --> 33:02.110
Why shouldn't I?
They're the one couple

33:02.112 --> 33:03.861
that makes me believe marriage
is possible.

33:03.863 --> 33:05.896
I mean, I'm sitting right here.

33:06.898 --> 33:08.449
Thank you, Linus.

33:08.451 --> 33:10.201
Barney, the thing is...

33:10.203 --> 33:13.621
Cover your ears and hum "The
Battle Hymn of the Republic""

33:13.623 --> 33:14.806
Why?

33:14.808 --> 33:17.358
It's for the bride.

33:17.360 --> 33:18.843
Oh, it's for...

33:18.845 --> 33:20.044
Okay, listen, James,

33:20.046 --> 33:21.713
my cousin Vince
is a Mountie.

33:21.715 --> 33:24.432
His girlfriend is back home,
but he gets gay at weddings.

33:24.434 --> 33:26.134
He's yours.
I am giving you Vince.

33:26.136 --> 33:27.719
Just please,
don't tell Barney.

33:27.721 --> 33:29.137
If he finds out
that the only

33:29.139 --> 33:30.805
successful marriage
in his life is over...

33:30.807 --> 33:32.106
I hate everyone
at this table.

33:32.108 --> 33:33.107
...it'll spook him.

33:33.109 --> 33:34.409
I don't want him
getting spooked.

33:34.411 --> 33:36.544
Robin, have some faith.

33:36.546 --> 33:39.480
Do you really think what you
and Barney have is that fragile?

33:40.482 --> 33:42.450
I don't want to find out.

33:42.452 --> 33:44.118
Fine.

33:46.872 --> 33:48.072
Thanks, baby.

33:48.074 --> 33:49.574
No sweat.
Mmm...

33:49.576 --> 33:52.393
So, James, seriously,
where's Tom?

33:52.395 --> 33:53.628
He can't make the wedding.

33:53.630 --> 33:55.079
He had his wisdom teeth out.

33:55.081 --> 33:56.447
Ugh! On top of a divorce?

33:56.449 --> 33:57.665
That is rough.

33:58.734 --> 34:00.401
Uh-oh.

34:00.403 --> 34:03.471
What is she talking about?

34:04.440 --> 34:06.741
Tom and I are getting a divorce.

34:10.396 --> 34:11.846
Excuse me.

34:16.101 --> 34:19.087
Vince... off the table.

34:21.889 --> 34:23.741
What was that?
I don't know.

34:23.743 --> 34:25.176
It just came out.

34:25.178 --> 34:26.878
That's it.
It's barely even noon.

34:26.880 --> 34:28.496
You're cut off.

34:28.498 --> 34:30.197
Thank you, Linus.

34:31.283 --> 34:32.833
Thank you, Linus.

34:33.668 --> 34:35.485
Thank you, Linus.

34:36.338 --> 34:37.987
Thank you, Linus.

34:37.989 --> 34:39.507
Thank you, Linus.

34:39.509 --> 34:41.592
Okay, but after that one,
you're cut off!

34:43.395 --> 34:45.880
No! No, you are not doing this.
Step away from the desk.

34:45.882 --> 34:46.964
What are you talking about?

34:46.966 --> 34:48.599
You just found out
about James and Tom,

34:48.601 --> 34:51.018
and it totally freaked you out,
and now you're asking this guy

34:51.020 --> 34:52.186
to point you in the direction

34:52.188 --> 34:53.404
of the nearest,
dirtiest strip club.

34:53.406 --> 34:55.505
Oh, well,
that-that's a tough one.

34:55.507 --> 34:58.226
Uh, the nearest one
that's-that's kind of dirty

34:58.228 --> 34:59.794
is The Sand Box,

34:59.796 --> 35:02.730
but the, uh...
the dirtiest one that's nearby

35:02.732 --> 35:04.515
is The Crab Shed.

35:04.517 --> 35:05.633
Dude.

35:05.635 --> 35:08.236
Sorry. Uh, but hey,
if-if you do go,

35:08.238 --> 35:10.204
maybe you could take Ted.

35:10.206 --> 35:11.856
I'm really worried
about that kid.

35:13.158 --> 35:15.710
No, Robin, I am not
going to a strip club.

35:15.712 --> 35:16.978
Especially right now.

35:16.980 --> 35:20.164
Could you imagine
the day shift at The Crab Shed?

35:21.216 --> 35:23.084
Robin...

35:23.086 --> 35:25.970
I came to the desk to get this.

35:25.972 --> 35:27.655
Is that the key to our room?

35:27.657 --> 35:29.390
It's the key to James's room.

35:35.097 --> 35:36.431
Oh, my.

35:36.433 --> 35:37.815
What is that?

35:37.817 --> 35:39.167
It's an erotic cake.

35:39.169 --> 35:41.051
I wanted to surprise them
for their anniversary.

35:41.053 --> 35:42.520
Is that... is that
James and Tom?

35:42.522 --> 35:46.407
Mmm, caramel marzipan,
chocolate marzipan.

35:46.409 --> 35:47.975
I love chocolate
marzipan.

35:47.977 --> 35:50.778
So does Tom.
Used to anyway.

35:51.997 --> 35:55.065
This is, uh, absolutely the,
uh... the weirdest thing

35:55.067 --> 35:57.785
anyone has ever done
for their sibling.

35:59.204 --> 36:01.405
I love you so much.

36:02.240 --> 36:04.342
You thought I was
gonna freak out.

36:04.344 --> 36:06.878
Well, I mean, a Gypsy
cursed your family

36:06.880 --> 36:09.764
to become hornier and do
awesome guitar solos.

36:09.766 --> 36:11.516
Can you blame me?

36:11.518 --> 36:14.018
Look, am I bummed about James
and Tom getting a divorce?

36:14.020 --> 36:17.138
Obviously.
But I don't need them

36:17.140 --> 36:19.524
to make me believe
in true love anymore.

36:19.526 --> 36:20.975
I've got you for that now.

36:20.977 --> 36:22.777
Mmm.

36:22.779 --> 36:26.247
Oh, man, now I gotta figure out
what to do with all this stuff.

36:26.249 --> 36:28.399
Well, before we do that...

36:28.401 --> 36:31.452
um, would it be all
right if I nibbled

36:31.454 --> 36:33.905
on your brother's
Ding Dong?

36:33.907 --> 36:36.574
How about we nibble

36:36.576 --> 36:40.411
on my brother's
Ding Dong together?

36:40.413 --> 36:42.296
I'd like that.

36:44.115 --> 36:46.334
So, they cleaned all that stuff
<i>out of there</i>

36:46.336 --> 36:48.002
<i>and had a talk with James.</i>

36:48.004 --> 36:51.506
<i>And Barney didn't freak out,</i>
because here's the thing, kids.

36:51.508 --> 36:55.560
<i>When you believe in people,</i>
<i>people come through.</i>

37:00.833 --> 37:03.251
Just so we're clear,
I pick the music.

37:03.253 --> 37:04.535
Of course.

37:04.537 --> 37:05.520
Say it.

37:05.522 --> 37:07.255
Say, "Daphne picks the music."

37:07.257 --> 37:09.073
Daphne picks the music.

37:09.075 --> 37:10.241
And you pay for gas.

37:10.243 --> 37:11.993
Are you kidding?
Do you have any idea

37:11.995 --> 37:13.227
how much gas this thing takes?

37:13.229 --> 37:14.428
No, no, okay!

37:14.430 --> 37:15.763
Okay, I pay for gas.

37:15.765 --> 37:17.331
Good. Now, get in.

37:17.333 --> 37:19.149
It's a long ride to Phoenix.

37:19.151 --> 37:20.718
Say what?

37:20.720 --> 37:23.087
I'm just kidding.

37:23.089 --> 37:25.206
Oh, this is gonna be fun.

37:30.028 --> 37:31.846
This must be the singles table.

37:31.848 --> 37:35.516
Guess it is.

37:37.002 --> 37:39.203
Well, it's kind of nice
to be asking this question

37:39.205 --> 37:40.688
instead of answering it
for a change:

37:40.690 --> 37:41.756
How are you doing?

37:41.758 --> 37:43.674
I don't know.

37:44.560 --> 37:46.277
I'm trying to be happy
for my brother,

37:46.279 --> 37:48.012
but, uh... I guess a person

37:48.014 --> 37:49.897
has a different
perspective on weddings

37:49.899 --> 37:53.334
when he knows what's down there
at the end of the aisle.

37:54.269 --> 37:56.437
It's not all
champagne and frosting.

37:57.406 --> 38:00.524
Mr. Stinson, your room is ready.

38:00.526 --> 38:02.310
And, Ted...

38:02.312 --> 38:04.495
she's right around the corner.

38:04.497 --> 38:06.080
Thank you, Curtis.

38:06.082 --> 38:07.882
I feel it, too.

38:07.884 --> 38:09.417
No, no, no, the-the housekeeper.

38:09.419 --> 38:11.502
She's in the room that's right
around the corner from yours.

38:11.504 --> 38:12.670
Oh.
So another hour, tops.

38:12.672 --> 38:14.922
Sure.

38:14.924 --> 38:16.507
Okay, see you later, Ted.

38:16.509 --> 38:18.175
You're not
giving up, James.

38:19.210 --> 38:21.078
And neither am I.

38:37.297 --> 38:38.362
Hey, beautiful.

38:38.364 --> 38:39.347
Hi.

38:39.349 --> 38:41.332
God, you look great.

38:41.334 --> 38:43.217
What? Come on.

38:43.219 --> 38:44.268
You do!

38:44.270 --> 38:46.087
I've been in a car all morning.

38:46.089 --> 38:49.440
I just ate a croissant crumb
that I found in my bra.

38:49.442 --> 38:50.758
I'm disgusting.

38:50.760 --> 38:53.678
Yeah, I saw you do that.
And it was super hot. Come here.

38:53.680 --> 38:55.346
You come here.
Come here.

38:55.348 --> 38:58.215
No, you come here.
Come here.

38:58.217 --> 38:59.917
Hey, you want to hear
something funny?

38:59.919 --> 39:00.935
Mm-hmm.

39:00.937 --> 39:03.270
One year ago today,
almost to the minute,

39:03.272 --> 39:05.589
I was sitting
at this very table

39:05.591 --> 39:07.058
right in that seat.

39:08.226 --> 39:10.394
Oh, yeah. I can see it.

39:10.396 --> 39:12.863
Nursing your gin and tonic
with three extra limes,

39:12.865 --> 39:14.682
doing the crossword,

39:14.684 --> 39:17.267
probably being
all showboat-y about it.

39:17.269 --> 39:18.169
I wasn't being
showboat-y about it.

39:18.171 --> 39:21.205
"Vesuvius""
Boo-yah!

39:22.874 --> 39:24.959
Oh, wait, that doesn't fit.

39:24.961 --> 39:27.261
The point is,
one year ago today,

39:27.263 --> 39:30.831
I made a promise to myself
right at this table.

39:30.833 --> 39:32.900
What was the promise?

39:32.902 --> 39:37.438
I'm coming back,
and I'm bringing you.

39:37.440 --> 39:39.407
Wait a second.
Hold it.

39:39.409 --> 39:42.677
One year ago today,
you hadn't even met me.

39:42.679 --> 39:44.845
I know, but I knew I would.

39:45.881 --> 39:47.648
And now it's a year later.

39:47.650 --> 39:49.316
And here I am.

39:49.318 --> 39:50.668
Here you are.

39:50.670 --> 39:52.103
Love in your eyes,

39:52.105 --> 39:53.988
baked goods
in your undergarments.

39:53.990 --> 39:55.022
Yeah.

39:55.024 --> 39:57.291
You picked a real winner, Mosby.

39:57.293 --> 40:00.044
I did.

40:01.513 --> 40:03.330
Okay, seriously, what the crap

40:03.332 --> 40:05.349
is taking so long
with these rooms?

40:05.351 --> 40:07.284
It was like this
last year.

40:07.286 --> 40:09.003
I'll be right back.

40:09.005 --> 40:11.372
I'll be right here.

40:28.258 --> 40:30.395
Sorry that took so long.

40:31.028 --> 40:32.361
Please...

40:32.363 --> 40:34.196
try to enjoy your stay.

40:34.198 --> 40:36.165
I will.

40:36.167 --> 40:37.315
Try to.

40:37.317 --> 40:41.036
I will enjoy my stay.

40:41.038 --> 40:42.153
Try.

40:42.155 --> 40:43.789
Not gonna try.

40:43.791 --> 40:46.959
Just... just gonna do it.

40:46.961 --> 40:47.993
Good for you.

40:47.995 --> 40:49.011
Not good for me.

40:49.013 --> 40:52.397
No, just-just neutral for me.

40:52.399 --> 40:55.050
Attaboy.
No, at not a boy.

40:57.720 --> 40:58.854
It gets better.

40:58.856 --> 41:01.273
I am fine, Curtis. Okay?

41:01.275 --> 41:04.393
I enjoy and appreciate
the happiness of other people

41:04.395 --> 41:08.130
whether I am in a relationship
or not. Okay? Curtis?

41:08.132 --> 41:09.314
So just-just...

41:09.316 --> 41:11.783
just go ahead
and give me my one key

41:11.785 --> 41:13.819
because I am fine.

41:24.770 --> 41:26.988
Oh, come on!
I need another drink.
