00:01.084 --> 00:02.293
FEMALE NARRATOR:
<i>Previously on </i>Boston Legal...

00:02.377 --> 00:04.129
Aren't women just the best?

00:04.212 --> 00:07.507
You've been through wives before, Denny.
Five of them.

00:07.590 --> 00:08.925
-Bella.
-Beverly Bridge.

00:09.009 --> 00:10.218
-Bethany.
-Clovis.

00:10.301 --> 00:12.095
-She's the one.
-She's the one.

00:12.178 --> 00:15.557
After five or six wives,
you still believe in the one?

00:15.640 --> 00:17.809
-Denny, you're glowing.
-She's an amazing woman, Alan.

00:17.892 --> 00:19.436
Mad cow. Mad cow. Mad cow.

00:19.519 --> 00:21.646
Like I'll remember it. Mad cow. Mad cow.

00:21.730 --> 00:24.649
Love is an ugly business, my friend.
Ugly business.

00:25.025 --> 00:25.984
Ugly business.

00:37.537 --> 00:39.164
-It's ten o'clock.
-Are we not on?

00:39.247 --> 00:41.416
It's supposed to be Tuesday
at 10:00 every week.

00:42.000 --> 00:44.711
We've been moved.
We're Wednesday at 10:00.

00:44.794 --> 00:47.922
-Nobody called me.
-They told Howie in Word Processing.

00:48.006 --> 00:49.507
They called Howie in Word Processing?

00:49.591 --> 00:51.718
Are we Wednesdays at 10:00 from now on?

00:51.801 --> 00:54.554
No. We're off next week,
then on for the following two Wednesdays.

00:54.637 --> 00:57.599
-What about next year?
-Best to just keep checking in with Howie.

00:58.975 --> 01:01.561
Excuse me. Are you Denny Crane?

01:02.896 --> 01:05.648
Denny Crane. What can I do for you?
Let me rephrase.

01:06.441 --> 01:07.609
What can we do for each other?

01:08.068 --> 01:10.445
I'm Sunny Fields, of Sunny Fields Farms?

01:10.737 --> 01:13.323
-I'm in love.
-SUNNY (chuckles): You're cute.

01:13.656 --> 01:15.950
-That, too.
-You eat meat, Mr. Crane?

01:16.034 --> 01:18.578
-My place or yours?
-I'm a cattle rancher.

01:18.787 --> 01:21.039
The FDA is about to sign off
on cloned meat.

01:21.122 --> 01:23.208
Once they do,
the floodgates are gonna open.

01:23.291 --> 01:24.751
I need a lawyer to stop that flood.

01:25.502 --> 01:27.170
Are you that lawyer, Denny Crane?

01:27.545 --> 01:31.007
There's never been a dam or a damsel
I couldn't plug.

01:33.009 --> 01:34.260
Marry me.

01:37.680 --> 01:41.184
(theme music playing)

02:06.876 --> 02:09.212
I'm confused. Are you cloning the meat?

02:09.379 --> 02:12.507
No, no, sweetheart. The biotech companies
are cloning the meat.

02:12.590 --> 02:13.925
I'm the one that's trying to stop it.

02:14.008 --> 02:17.345
I believe that procreation should happen
the old-fashioned way.

02:17.428 --> 02:18.680
When can we get started?

02:19.013 --> 02:23.476
How far are we away from cloned animals
actually being a reality?

02:23.560 --> 02:25.812
Oh, hell, honey. They're already here.

02:26.187 --> 02:27.647
They have hundreds of pigs

02:27.730 --> 02:29.607
and some of their piglets
have already made it

02:29.691 --> 02:33.027
into the food supply, by the way,
and now, they're trying to use beef.

02:33.111 --> 02:37.115
My question is, who put the mad cows
in charge of the asylum?

02:37.198 --> 02:38.199
Hear, hear. Be nice.

02:38.658 --> 02:42.245
They have a moratorium on using cloned
animals which is about to be lifted.

02:42.328 --> 02:44.122
That's why I would like to move fast.

02:44.205 --> 02:47.584
-Denny, you don't need me on this.
-Carl. Carl.

02:50.920 --> 02:54.215
-Carl, uh, I need a heavy hitter.
-I thought you were a heavy hitter.

02:54.299 --> 02:57.385
I am. But I'd like to do my hitting
on her. I'm in love with her.

02:57.468 --> 02:59.304
Look, Carl, this is
a great opportunity for you

02:59.387 --> 03:01.222
to be a consumer advocate here,

03:01.306 --> 03:05.143
which the country needs because Nader
is running for president again.

03:05.226 --> 03:08.646
And, uh, well, I'd ask Alan,
but he's busy.

03:10.106 --> 03:10.940
Please?

03:18.031 --> 03:19.157
I'm just gonna say this,

03:19.240 --> 03:22.410
uh, and let me preface it by admitting
I know this is a crazy notion.

03:22.493 --> 03:24.621
-Okay.
-I wanna sue my nephew.

03:25.580 --> 03:26.623
Okay, what's he done?

03:26.706 --> 03:29.709
It's not what he's done so much
as what he's planning to do.

03:31.002 --> 03:32.253
And what does he plan to do?

03:32.670 --> 03:33.755
Vote for Obama.

03:34.631 --> 03:36.591
I could be wrong,
but I believe he has that right,

03:36.674 --> 03:39.052
unless there's some fine print
in the PATRIOT Act--

03:39.135 --> 03:40.470
Alan, he is a delegate.

03:40.553 --> 03:42.472
He plans to vote for Obama
at the convention

03:42.555 --> 03:46.309
even though his congressional district
voted for Clinton, as did Massachusetts.

03:46.601 --> 03:48.228
-Well, can he do that?
-Well, yes.

03:48.311 --> 03:50.647
That's the dirty little secret
no one's talking about.

03:51.064 --> 03:53.858
Even the pledge delegates can ignore
their constituencies.

03:53.942 --> 03:56.236
Uh, it's unethical, in my opinion.

03:56.319 --> 03:59.072
And if the rules allow for that,
then the rules have to be challenged.

03:59.155 --> 04:01.282
And by challenged,
you mean the little-used act

04:01.366 --> 04:03.117
of anarchy known as suing the nephew?

04:03.534 --> 04:07.538
Alan, this nomination could very well
come down to a handful of delegates,

04:08.164 --> 04:10.041
poached delegates, I might add.

04:10.124 --> 04:14.629
Every vote counts,
including my nephew's. Sue.

04:27.141 --> 04:28.726
I'm really quite shocked, Aunt Shirley.

04:29.060 --> 04:32.438
I've been taken completely unaware.
How can you sue me?

04:32.522 --> 04:33.648
-Mitchell--
-Mitchy.

04:35.316 --> 04:38.194
Mitchy, you don't think it's wrong

04:38.278 --> 04:40.321
that your entire district voted
for Hillary, but--

04:40.405 --> 04:44.951
Forty-two percent. It's funny how
a plurality can morph into an entirety.

04:46.035 --> 04:47.370
Must be that Clinton math.

04:48.329 --> 04:52.834
I think your aunt's point, Mitchy,
is that Hillary won your district

04:52.917 --> 04:55.837
as well as the entire state
of Massachusetts.

04:55.920 --> 04:57.797
You have a duty
to represent your constituency

04:57.880 --> 04:59.424
at the convention, do you not?

04:59.632 --> 05:01.926
Well, I'm not duty bound, Mr. Shore.

05:02.635 --> 05:05.471
Delegates are more like duty-urged.

05:06.472 --> 05:11.102
Mitchy, you're 22 years old,
with less voting experience than--

05:11.185 --> 05:14.564
(cell phone ringing)

05:14.647 --> 05:18.776
I'll say this for her. She is a bulldog.
Excuse me for a second.

05:20.611 --> 05:23.281
Probably calling to say
she found her voice again. (giggles)

05:26.075 --> 05:28.244
You have got to be able to stop him.

05:28.328 --> 05:32.332
(chuckles) I don't see how.
As he says, he's within party rules.

05:32.415 --> 05:35.209
-I can't bear it.
-Well, there's only two other options.

05:36.377 --> 05:38.796
We could stuff him in a barrel
and send him out to sea.

05:40.173 --> 05:42.842
-Or?
-We could sue the Democratic Party.

05:49.265 --> 05:52.143
You can't sue food or drugs.

05:52.560 --> 05:55.104
How can anybody sue food or drugs?

05:55.188 --> 05:57.690
We're suing the Food
and Drug Administration, Your Honor.

05:57.774 --> 05:59.901
-The FDA.
-What the hell is that?

05:59.984 --> 06:02.403
That would be the agency
in charge of your meds, Judge.

06:02.862 --> 06:06.199
And in fact, I would suspect somebody
very much like yourself or Denny

06:06.282 --> 06:08.493
-is in charge of that department.
-Objection.

06:08.576 --> 06:12.121
Mr. Sack, flattery has no place in this...

06:13.873 --> 06:15.166
It would be a courtroom, Your Honor.

06:15.500 --> 06:17.168
Your Honor, this should be
in federal court.

06:17.251 --> 06:18.628
They are suing a federal agency.
Jurisdiction--

06:18.711 --> 06:21.422
Next, he's gonna play the sovereign
immunity card. It's a dodge.

06:21.506 --> 06:23.091
Stop with the jibber-jabber.

06:23.508 --> 06:26.594
Jibber-jabber has no place
in my courtroom.

06:26.677 --> 06:28.388
You understand, Mr. Sack?

06:28.471 --> 06:30.139
Yes, Your Honor.
Jibber-jabber and flattery.

06:30.223 --> 06:32.100
May I call a witness to lay out my case?

06:32.183 --> 06:36.396
Silence. I will decide how to proceed.
I am the decider.

06:38.231 --> 06:39.107
Call a witness.

06:40.650 --> 06:43.361
Thank you, Your Honor.
I call Sunny Fields.

06:47.824 --> 06:53.121
How are we doing today, Judge?
Well, aren't you adorable up close.

07:04.298 --> 07:06.426
The motion is filed.
We're in at two o'clock.

07:08.302 --> 07:10.179
We're actually suing the DNC.

07:10.263 --> 07:13.766
Yes. I also subpoenaed Mitchy.
We'll need him as a witness.

07:14.851 --> 07:17.228
You realize the media will pounce on this.

07:18.604 --> 07:20.731
I've practiced law for 38 years

07:20.815 --> 07:23.818
and never once have I done
something stupid.

07:23.901 --> 07:27.029
Well, now you're being hard on yourself.
I've seen you be stupid many times.

07:27.113 --> 07:28.281
(chuckles)

07:31.200 --> 07:35.830
I sit here
in my tastefully decorated office

07:35.913 --> 07:39.834
and watch you go about tilting
at windmills.

07:40.710 --> 07:42.462
Many times beating the windmill.

07:44.088 --> 07:45.131
Well, it's my turn.

07:47.258 --> 07:51.804
It's my turn to stand up
and make a complete idiot of myself

07:51.888 --> 07:57.310
and do something that leaves this nation

07:57.393 --> 07:59.103
a slightly better place.

08:01.481 --> 08:03.774
That, and a chance to paste
your annoying nephew.

08:05.067 --> 08:07.862
Yeah. I can't pass that up.

08:09.572 --> 08:12.492
It's settled then.
We're off to sue the Democrats.

08:19.957 --> 08:21.209
I know the science, darling.

08:21.292 --> 08:24.670
I also know that most of the scientists
who did the testing we're hired

08:24.754 --> 08:26.422
by the cloning companies.

08:26.631 --> 08:28.841
The science on this is in the bag.

08:29.550 --> 08:31.552
A lot of people have no problem
eating cloned meat.

08:31.636 --> 08:34.222
Well, most people aren't even gonna know.
That's the worst part.

08:34.805 --> 08:38.309
The FDA doesn't even require
that the cloned stuff be labeled.

08:38.392 --> 08:39.977
I don't think I'd wanna know.

08:43.481 --> 08:46.317
Have you any evidence
that cloned meat is unsafe?

08:46.609 --> 08:48.945
Oh, it's too early to tell either way.

08:49.028 --> 08:53.324
But if it's not natural, would you eat it?

08:56.077 --> 08:58.079
All the FDA studies have concluded
that it's safe.

08:58.412 --> 09:01.624
Honey, the FDA said
that VIOXX was safe.

09:01.958 --> 09:04.293
Isn't the real issue here
that you're a cattle rancher

09:04.585 --> 09:05.962
and you don't want the competition?

09:06.045 --> 09:08.089
No, I'm more concerned
about animal abuse, darling.

09:08.506 --> 09:09.715
-Animal abuse?
-SUNNY: Yes.

09:09.799 --> 09:13.261
The surrogate mothers are pumped up
with high levels of hormones.

09:13.594 --> 09:16.597
The clones are often born
with compromised immune systems

09:16.973 --> 09:19.976
which require massive doses
of antibiotics,

09:20.059 --> 09:22.311
which, by the way, opens up the door

09:22.395 --> 09:25.523
for the veterinary pharmaceuticals
to enter into the human food supply.

09:25.606 --> 09:28.609
There is no evidence
that cloned meat poses any health risk.

09:28.693 --> 09:32.113
Darling, cloning increases the risk
of food-borne illness.

09:32.196 --> 09:34.365
Even the National Academy
of Sciences says so.

09:34.782 --> 09:38.369
Once you take nature out of the process,
which cloning does,

09:38.953 --> 09:42.206
it destroys the natural barriers
against disease.

09:42.290 --> 09:45.751
Now, that poses a health problem
for cows and people.

09:47.378 --> 09:48.588
Like you and me.

10:03.978 --> 10:04.937
(elevator bell dings)

10:05.021 --> 10:07.732
Mr. Shore, Wolfgang Blitzkrieg with the
best political news team in television.

10:07.815 --> 10:09.150
I have no comment yet.

10:09.233 --> 10:12.111
Ms. Schmidt, Wolfgang Blitzkrieg with the
best political news team in television.

10:12.194 --> 10:13.613
Could I get you to talk just for a second

10:13.696 --> 10:14.947
with the best political news team
in television?

10:15.031 --> 10:15.990
Go away.

10:16.073 --> 10:17.950
(overlapping dialog)

10:18.034 --> 10:19.201
This has been Wolfgang Blitzkrieg

10:19.285 --> 10:21.412
with the best political news team
in television.

10:21.495 --> 10:22.705
You only got it here.

10:23.914 --> 10:26.375
This is outrageous.

10:26.459 --> 10:29.503
We had a feeling you'd say that, Judge,
but we actually do have a case.

10:29.587 --> 10:30.838
No, you do not.

10:30.921 --> 10:33.257
The Democratic Party
is a private organization.

10:33.341 --> 10:35.092
We make what rules we want.

10:35.176 --> 10:36.761
Not when it violates one man, one vote.

10:36.844 --> 10:38.554
What is it you're asking me to do?

10:38.638 --> 10:40.097
We'd like a court order, Judge, that says

10:40.181 --> 10:43.017
that pledge delegates have to vote
for the candidate they're pledged to,

10:43.100 --> 10:44.769
certainly on the first ballot.

10:44.852 --> 10:47.271
You want me to tell the Democrats
how to run their own party?

10:47.355 --> 10:49.190
-Somebody's got to.
-(gavel thuds)

10:50.232 --> 10:53.486
Give me one good reason
why I shouldn't dismiss this right now.

10:53.569 --> 10:57.323
Okay, you're a fair
and open-minded jurist.

10:57.406 --> 10:59.367
-(gavel thuds)
-Give me another reason!

10:59.992 --> 11:03.454
Okay. As long as there are only
two political parties,

11:03.537 --> 11:05.581
the public only has two choices
for president.

11:05.873 --> 11:08.918
One of them is being picked by delegates
like Mitchy Weston,

11:09.001 --> 11:10.294
that toddler over there,

11:10.378 --> 11:15.007
whose vote is worth 13,000 times
the vote of you and me.

11:15.091 --> 11:16.509
You're talking about a process
that's been in effect--

11:16.592 --> 11:18.678
I know what process I'm talking about.

11:19.136 --> 11:21.472
And it's about time it be exposed
for the fraud it is.

11:21.555 --> 11:23.099
-Fraud?
-Yes, fraud.

11:23.182 --> 11:26.268
If the primaries really don't count,
then they are just a sham.

11:26.352 --> 11:29.814
They count! They're just not binding,
snidey butt.

11:32.149 --> 11:34.944
I want it on the record
that I've just been called "snidey butt"

11:35.027 --> 11:38.447
by a person whose vote
is worth 13,000 times

11:38.531 --> 11:41.158
more than mine, and yours,
and Your Honor's.

11:41.242 --> 11:42.993
That's enough!

11:43.452 --> 11:44.954
We'll adjourn until nine o'clock
tomorrow morning.

11:45.788 --> 11:48.165
I'll conduct a full evidentiary hearing.

11:48.249 --> 11:49.291
(reporters clamoring)

11:49.375 --> 11:50.501
Okay, Shirley, you're up.

11:50.751 --> 11:53.963
Ms. Schmidt, Wolfgang Blitzkrieg with the
best political news team in television.

11:54.046 --> 11:55.506
We really are the best, by the way.

11:55.589 --> 11:58.342
Can you tell me,
has this case been politicized?

12:06.267 --> 12:08.811
Oh, you were brilliant.

12:08.894 --> 12:12.898
-(chuckles) Honey, I'm always brilliant.
-No.

12:15.609 --> 12:18.195
I don't just jump into bed
with any woman, you know.

12:19.613 --> 12:23.159
Actually, I do.
But this time, it's different.

12:25.161 --> 12:25.995
I...

12:27.913 --> 12:29.415
I think we should be together.

12:29.915 --> 12:31.876
Mm. You're sweet.

12:31.959 --> 12:33.002
No, I mean it.

12:34.879 --> 12:36.255
I'm falling in love with you.

12:37.840 --> 12:39.925
Honey, I think you're cute as a button,

12:40.718 --> 12:43.012
but I tend to treat men like horses.

12:43.387 --> 12:46.223
-I ride 'em hard and then I turn 'em out.
-I'm okay with that.

12:50.019 --> 12:52.104
(sighs) Truth is, my...

12:53.564 --> 12:57.026
tawdry affairs tend to last longer
than my committed relationships.

12:57.902 --> 13:00.738
But this is different.

13:04.200 --> 13:06.869
I feel a... a real connection.

13:08.454 --> 13:10.247
Denny Crane, I'm a cattle rancher.

13:10.831 --> 13:14.835
You think a big city slicker like yourself
would be happy living on a farm?

13:17.046 --> 13:18.172
I love horses.

13:18.798 --> 13:21.258
I love cows. I love sheep.

13:23.219 --> 13:24.887
Especially sheep.

13:24.970 --> 13:26.555
SUNNY:
I'm an all-or-nothing kind of girl.

13:27.264 --> 13:30.643
If you're with me, you gotta be on a farm.

13:31.936 --> 13:32.770
I'm there.

13:35.439 --> 13:36.857
You're out of your mind.

13:36.941 --> 13:41.070
Oh, this woman, Alan.
She's the one. I know it.

13:41.153 --> 13:42.613
-In just one day?
-In ten minutes.

13:42.696 --> 13:44.573
-(chuckles) Oh, come on.
-DENNY: It's like a movie.

13:44.657 --> 13:46.283
A glance here, a look there.

13:47.701 --> 13:49.912
(sighs) Has that ever happened to you?

13:50.287 --> 13:52.331
-No.
-She's a goddess, Alan.

13:53.582 --> 13:56.335
You really are smitten.

13:58.504 --> 14:00.923
So is she. I could see it in her eyes.

14:06.262 --> 14:07.763
Did you know that I am as cute
as a button?

14:08.264 --> 14:14.103
Denny, I say this with love
and in the spirit of friendship.

14:15.062 --> 14:19.358
-The idea of you on a ranch--
-What?

14:20.442 --> 14:22.403
-Well, you're a little...
-A little what?

14:24.280 --> 14:26.907
Roly-poly. In a good way.

14:26.991 --> 14:28.242
I'm a rugged man!

14:28.325 --> 14:30.327
Yes. And cute as a button.

14:33.455 --> 14:34.498
Oh, dear.

14:37.960 --> 14:41.589
<i>With the best political news team</i>
<i>ever assembled in the history--</i>

14:56.395 --> 14:59.356
The rules may technically allow
the pledge delegates

14:59.440 --> 15:01.150
to ignore the mandate of the popular vote,

15:01.233 --> 15:03.694
but that's certainly not
what the Democratic Party advertises.

15:04.236 --> 15:06.906
People go to the primary polls
under the assumption,

15:07.531 --> 15:09.700
an assumption cultivated by the DNC,

15:09.783 --> 15:15.039
that whatever candidate wins that primary,
he or she will get the delegates.

15:15.539 --> 15:17.458
Let's put our cards on the table,
Miss Schmidt.

15:17.541 --> 15:19.543
-You're for Hillary?
-I am.

15:19.877 --> 15:21.921
And you want your nephew
to vote for Hillary?

15:22.713 --> 15:25.633
I want the delegates,
especially the pledge delegates,

15:25.716 --> 15:28.510
to give the primary some meaning.

15:28.928 --> 15:32.264
It should probably also be said
we're in a time of war.

15:34.183 --> 15:36.894
-What do you mean?
-Well, the country needs stability.

15:36.977 --> 15:40.314
It needs to count on its bedrocks,
its established traditions.

15:40.397 --> 15:43.984
For 20 years now, we've only had
two families in the White House.

15:44.068 --> 15:48.280
Just the two. First a Bush,
then a Clinton, then, uh, Clinton again,

15:48.364 --> 15:50.366
then another Bush, then that Bush again.

15:50.449 --> 15:51.492
It's time for another Clinton!

15:51.575 --> 15:56.205
We simply cannot afford to experiment
in such uncertain times.

15:58.582 --> 16:00.542
-What the hell was that about?
-What?

16:01.043 --> 16:02.586
You totally politicized this.

16:02.670 --> 16:04.713
You practically stumped for Obama!

16:04.797 --> 16:05.756
I did no such thing.

16:05.839 --> 16:09.802
I just happen to be a big fan
of dynasties and monarchies.

16:09.885 --> 16:11.136
Oh, I love monarchies.

16:11.220 --> 16:13.806
This is not to be turned
into your political forum, Alan.

16:13.889 --> 16:16.308
Look, Shirley, may I speak to you
for a second as a friend,

16:16.392 --> 16:19.311
one who can hold you in the bad days
and spoon you in the good ones?

16:19.395 --> 16:21.397
-Alan--
-This is a good thing for you,

16:21.689 --> 16:23.148
-what's going on here.
-How so?

16:23.232 --> 16:26.318
Well, you want Hillary, right?
Consider Hillary's behind in the count.

16:26.652 --> 16:28.195
She can't possibly be the nominee

16:28.487 --> 16:30.990
unless she poaches
some of Obama's pledge delegates.

16:31.073 --> 16:33.409
And if delegates are bound
to the mandate of the voters,

16:33.701 --> 16:36.745
that may be good for democracy,
but it would be very bad for Hillary.

16:36.829 --> 16:39.206
So you need to just chill out, relax.

16:39.289 --> 16:43.335
If anybody's gonna hijack this thing,
it's gonna be the Clintons. So just chill.

16:43.419 --> 16:45.671
If you even think of using this case
to plug Obama--

16:45.754 --> 16:48.632
-You're using it to promote Hillary.
-I am promoting the process.

16:48.716 --> 16:51.593
A process that can only spit out
Clintons or Bushes.

16:51.677 --> 16:53.512
-Who have experience!
-Oh, aren't you sick of experience?

16:53.595 --> 16:55.973
The only reason your guy is senator
is because the incumbent

16:56.056 --> 16:57.683
-was caught in a sex scandal!
-Oh, please! She was the first lady--

16:57.766 --> 17:00.644
-She didn't-- Oh--
-She was not just a first lady.

17:00.728 --> 17:02.604
Doesn't the script call for you
to just keep repeating

17:02.688 --> 17:03.981
"Rev. Wright, Rev. Wright"?

17:04.064 --> 17:06.150
Except when she's finding her own voice,
which is crybaby.

17:06.525 --> 17:08.277
Shirley, I'm telling you,
if she gets the nomination,

17:08.360 --> 17:10.154
I'd sooner vote for the dead guy
from Arizona.

17:10.237 --> 17:12.031
-He looks like a girl!
-On top of that, she looks like a man!

17:18.996 --> 17:20.164
Listen to us.

17:21.290 --> 17:24.126
-We've sunk to the level of--
-Presidential candidates.

17:25.419 --> 17:26.628
Hug?

17:27.629 --> 17:28.756
Don't try anything.

17:29.006 --> 17:30.841
(heroic music playing)

17:58.660 --> 18:00.996
(Sunny laughing)

18:01.497 --> 18:04.124
-You can ride, Denny Crane.
-Yes, I can.

18:04.208 --> 18:06.668
-I'm an old farm boy.
-I can see that.

18:06.752 --> 18:07.586
(Denny chuckles)

18:08.337 --> 18:09.213
Can we stop?

18:09.922 --> 18:12.508
I'd like to check out the scenery.

18:14.968 --> 18:16.136
That, and my balls hurt.

18:17.971 --> 18:19.932
-It's beautiful, isn't it?
-Oh, yeah.

18:21.558 --> 18:26.480
If this cloning thing becomes a reality,
I'm gonna be out of business.

18:26.980 --> 18:30.150
Let me ask you a question. You got, uh,
what, a thousand head of cattle here?

18:30.692 --> 18:32.569
What's your control, really?

18:32.945 --> 18:36.698
I mean, how do you safeguard
against the, uh, the mad cow

18:36.782 --> 18:38.659
or any other disease?

18:38.742 --> 18:40.953
It's not like you can vet every animal.

18:41.036 --> 18:44.039
(sighs) Well, if I had a mad cow,
I wouldn't need a vet to tell me.

18:44.790 --> 18:47.167
My daddy said that the other cows
take care of that.

18:47.751 --> 18:49.169
They shun the afflicted animal.

18:50.254 --> 18:55.926
Even so, can't you make beef more pure
using high-tech methods like cloning?

18:56.260 --> 18:59.263
You know, if I believed that,
I wouldn't be fighting this.

19:01.765 --> 19:04.226
I really wouldn't. I mean it.

19:04.393 --> 19:06.061
-(horse whinnies)
-(cows mooing)

19:07.312 --> 19:08.147
What?

19:08.772 --> 19:11.191
I've never mentally undressed a woman
in chaps before.

19:11.275 --> 19:15.404
(chuckles) Come on over
and meet the livestock, Denny Crane.

19:15.487 --> 19:16.947
And I don't want you flirting
with any of them.

19:17.489 --> 19:20.659
Hello, my darlings. This is your lawyer.

19:21.076 --> 19:23.829
-He's a sweetie pie.
-(cows mooing)

19:27.249 --> 19:30.085
Ah! Well, that wasn't
very good manners, was it?

19:30.878 --> 19:34.506
It's as if you had mad cow,
Denny Crane. (laughs)

19:38.760 --> 19:42.181
Don't be ridiculous.
You can't be diagnosed by a fellow cow.

19:42.264 --> 19:44.683
-I can. They know.
-Oh, come on.

19:44.766 --> 19:46.101
And they told Sunny.

19:46.852 --> 19:50.522
-To be shunned by your peers like that...
-Will you listen to yourself?

19:50.606 --> 19:51.440
Come on, Alan.

19:51.523 --> 19:54.735
You've seen the studies
where dogs can smell cancer.

19:55.360 --> 19:58.030
The animals, they... they sense things.

19:59.156 --> 20:01.283
The whole herd...

20:02.159 --> 20:03.744
My condition was obvious to them.

20:03.827 --> 20:05.204
(chuckles)
-Am I that far gone?

20:05.287 --> 20:08.957
Okay, look, you've known you have issues.
It's no big deal.

20:09.041 --> 20:10.125
It's a big deal because I love Sunny.

20:10.209 --> 20:12.211
And she's not gonna let me
be around her livestock

20:12.294 --> 20:13.837
if she knows I've got
the, uh... the, uh...

20:13.921 --> 20:14.880
-Mad cow.
-Mad cow.

20:14.963 --> 20:17.507
-You're talking like a crazy person.
-That's not gonna help.

20:17.591 --> 20:18.800
(door opens)

20:20.177 --> 20:22.346
Denny, I'm having a hard time
wrapping my head

20:22.429 --> 20:25.933
around this sudden
and profound love you have.

20:26.016 --> 20:29.353
That's because it's never happened to you.
It's happened to me, I tell you.

20:29.436 --> 20:32.981
-You just met her!
-Alan, we need to go.

20:34.650 --> 20:36.818
Denny, we'll talk later, okay?

20:43.659 --> 20:45.911
-What's wrong?
-His client's cows are on to him.

20:50.290 --> 20:52.376
You realize, Mr. Weston,
that your congressional district

20:52.459 --> 20:54.962
and the State of Massachusetts
voted for Hillary Clinton?

20:55.254 --> 20:56.546
I do realize that, yes.

20:56.630 --> 21:00.175
Your own constituency thinks
that what you're doing is wrong.

21:00.259 --> 21:02.427
Well, to quote the vice president
when told the American people

21:02.511 --> 21:05.639
don't wanna see more soldiers die, "So?"

21:06.098 --> 21:07.891
He really said that. I kid you not.

21:07.975 --> 21:12.187
Mitchy, as a result
of the Massachusetts primary results,

21:12.479 --> 21:15.691
you became a pledged delegate
to Hillary Clinton.

21:15.774 --> 21:19.027
Yes, but according to the DNC rules,
I'm not bound by that.

21:19.444 --> 21:22.864
No, I am not.
Who does that remind you of?

21:23.365 --> 21:25.784
-"I did not have sex"--
-Mitchy!

21:26.201 --> 21:29.371
Look, I am entitled to vote my conscience.
That's what I'm choosing to do.

21:29.454 --> 21:32.666
Your conscience won't allow you
to vote for Mrs. Clinton?

21:32.916 --> 21:37.212
Look, I happen to think that she is
a brilliant woman, and brave, too.

21:37.629 --> 21:41.091
She took all that sniper fire for us.
She and Sinbad.

21:41.341 --> 21:46.138
Why do you feel compelled
to vote for Obama?

21:49.683 --> 21:51.184
We need a new America.

21:51.810 --> 21:54.021
Hillary Clinton is old America.

21:54.438 --> 21:58.066
I think the time has come for us
to bridge the gaps on the Senate floor.

21:58.608 --> 21:59.443
Yes, we can.

22:00.569 --> 22:02.446
We're not just Democrats and Republicans.

22:03.071 --> 22:05.449
We're Americans. Yes, we can.

22:05.907 --> 22:09.536
It's time for all people to come together.
Black, white, yellow, red.

22:09.619 --> 22:11.955
Yes, we can. Yes, we can.

22:12.039 --> 22:14.458
-Yes, we can!
-Oh, all right.

22:16.168 --> 22:18.295
You sound like
The Little Engine That Could.

22:18.378 --> 22:20.964
How great that you have an opinion.

22:21.048 --> 22:22.716
Do you think it's fair, though, for you

22:22.799 --> 22:25.344
to exalt your politics
over the will of your district?

22:25.635 --> 22:27.929
I have a dream
where people of all creeds--

22:28.013 --> 22:32.017
Yes. What if all the delegates had a dream
that it should be Kucinich in July?

22:32.309 --> 22:34.144
That would be okay, then,
within the rules?

22:37.606 --> 22:40.359
Let me ask,
how did you even get to be a delegate?

22:40.650 --> 22:42.944
-I did a lot of volunteer work.
-(Alan laughs)

22:43.028 --> 22:45.405
I was rewarded for my efforts
and made a national committeeman.

22:45.489 --> 22:47.532
-And how old are you?
-I'm 22.

22:48.200 --> 22:50.952
Mitchy, have you ever actually spoken
to Hillary Clinton?

22:51.036 --> 22:52.662
Yes. She and Barack
both dropped by.

22:52.746 --> 22:54.748
-Dropped by? Your house?
-Yes.

22:55.332 --> 22:56.917
-Isn't democracy swell?
-Objection.

22:57.000 --> 22:57.876
Sustained.

22:58.168 --> 23:00.504
Do you think it's possible
that your conscience has been corrupted?

23:00.587 --> 23:03.048
No, I do not! You listen to me.

23:03.382 --> 23:06.093
I am a proud member
of the Democratic Party.

23:06.426 --> 23:10.097
I take my cues from the chairman
of the Democratic National Committee,

23:10.472 --> 23:12.057
and he says that I can vote my conscience.

23:12.349 --> 23:14.643
I will follow his lead, not yours.

23:14.726 --> 23:18.146
That of the chairman
of the Democratic National Committee?

23:18.230 --> 23:20.899
-Yes.
-And that would be this guy?

23:21.775 --> 23:25.904
<i>And we're going to South Dakota,</i>
<i>and Oregon, and Washington, and Michigan!</i>

23:26.571 --> 23:29.324
<i>And then we're going to Washington, D.C.</i>
<i>to take back the White House!</i>

23:30.033 --> 23:31.952
<i>Yeah! Yeah!</i>

23:32.035 --> 23:34.246
<i>Yeah! Yeah!</i>

23:37.666 --> 23:38.792
He is a beacon.

23:47.426 --> 23:50.512
For the past six years, I've tracked
the safety of cloned meat and milk.

23:50.595 --> 23:52.973
It's not only safe,
but very likely more safe

23:53.056 --> 23:55.142
than products
from naturally bred livestock.

23:55.517 --> 23:58.103
-It is also of much higher quality.
-How so?

23:58.395 --> 24:00.814
Well, some cows are simply better
than others.

24:01.189 --> 24:04.025
We clone the top breeders,
the prizewinners, in fact,

24:04.443 --> 24:07.404
which gives us
a consistently higher grade.

24:07.487 --> 24:10.490
-What's the problem with labeling it then?
-Honestly?

24:11.116 --> 24:12.451
That'd be nice.

24:13.076 --> 24:14.244
The "yuck" factor.

24:14.911 --> 24:17.456
People hate the idea of cloning.

24:17.539 --> 24:19.207
If we were to label cloned food products,

24:19.291 --> 24:21.835
we'd never be given a fair chance
by the American public.

24:21.918 --> 24:25.172
So better to deny the people a choice,
like you did with VIOXX?

24:25.255 --> 24:27.466
Oh, God. I'm sick of everybody
throwing VIOXX in our faces.

24:27.549 --> 24:32.345
Well, yes. It's just those vocal few
opposed to heart attacks and strokes.

24:32.429 --> 24:35.056
-How about Bextra?
-Bextra got by us, I admit, but--

24:35.140 --> 24:39.227
Zelnorm, Baycol, Palladone, Tysabri,
NeutroSpec, Cylert, Permax.

24:39.311 --> 24:42.939
All those drugs were approved
by the FDA, only to be withdrawn

24:43.023 --> 24:45.108
after they caused serious,
sometimes fatal, side effects.

24:45.192 --> 24:48.111
Which particular failure would you prefer
having thrown in your face?

24:48.195 --> 24:51.114
-Special orders don't upset me.
-He's good.

24:51.406 --> 24:54.242
-May I say something?
-Who are you?

24:54.659 --> 24:58.497
Left-wing liberals love to dump
on the FDA.

24:58.580 --> 24:59.789
It seems to be the new sport.

25:00.290 --> 25:02.501
But the public knows damn well,

25:02.584 --> 25:06.379
we are a thoroughly competent organization
that serves Americans--

25:06.463 --> 25:07.589
This would be a different public

25:07.672 --> 25:09.257
than the one polled
by the<i> Wall Street Journal</i>

25:09.341 --> 25:11.551
which found that 70 percent
of American adults

25:11.635 --> 25:14.137
are skeptical of the FDA's ability
to protect--

25:14.221 --> 25:15.222
We're to trust polls now?

25:15.305 --> 25:16.598
If you prefer testimonials,

25:16.681 --> 25:18.683
I would call your attention
to a<i> 60 Minutes </i>interview

25:18.767 --> 25:22.145
with Dr. David Graham,
a senior scientist at the FDA

25:22.229 --> 25:24.898
who blamed the FDA
for allowing dangerous drugs

25:24.981 --> 25:26.066
to stay on the market.

25:26.149 --> 25:27.817
This case is about cloning.

25:27.901 --> 25:31.071
Now, which has been deemed safe
by a horrendously and famously

25:31.154 --> 25:33.448
inept governmental administration

25:33.532 --> 25:36.326
which shamelessly bends to the will
of the pharmaceutical companies.

25:36.409 --> 25:38.411
-Move to strike.
-If there is nothing to hide here,

25:38.495 --> 25:39.746
why not label?

25:39.829 --> 25:41.748
-Move to strike!
-Silence!

25:42.749 --> 25:44.876
I can't keep up!

25:53.260 --> 25:55.387
The Democratic Party
is a private organization.

25:55.470 --> 25:58.181
We can adopt
whatever funny rules we want.

25:58.265 --> 26:01.685
Nobody is required to be a member
of any party.

26:02.102 --> 26:03.687
Mr. Duprey, don't feed me that.

26:04.229 --> 26:06.189
There are only two real parties
in our country.

26:06.648 --> 26:08.733
They've picked our presidents
for a hundred years.

26:08.817 --> 26:10.694
And it's worked well for a hundred years.

26:10.777 --> 26:13.488
-Really? Even lately?
-Oh, sit down, you.

26:14.489 --> 26:17.158
These rules are designed

26:17.242 --> 26:19.202
to provide a checks and balances,
if you will.

26:19.536 --> 26:22.038
What if the public,
in some protest of sorts,

26:22.122 --> 26:23.039
voted for a comedian?

26:23.123 --> 26:25.166
You remember that Pat Paulsen ran
in 1968.

26:25.250 --> 26:29.170
What if Roseanne Barr,
or George Carlin, or Carrot Top

26:29.254 --> 26:30.380
captured the popular vote?

26:30.463 --> 26:32.424
-Could be an improvement--
-Down!

26:33.258 --> 26:37.721
The delegates and super delegates,
as a matter of conscience,

26:37.804 --> 26:40.599
have to be allowed to say, "Whoa!"

26:40.932 --> 26:43.143
Well, so you admit
it's not really a democracy then?

26:43.226 --> 26:44.644
Classically speaking, no.

26:44.728 --> 26:46.229
I mean, suppose
we were in the same situation

26:46.313 --> 26:47.772
as the Republicans, for example.

26:47.856 --> 26:50.650
And suppose John McCain,
before the convention,

26:50.734 --> 26:52.777
succumbed to old age or senility.

26:52.861 --> 26:54.446
-You mean he hasn't?
-(gavel thuds)

26:55.572 --> 26:58.408
Should we stick in Mike Huckabee

26:58.491 --> 27:00.076
because he would be the leader
in delegates?

27:00.160 --> 27:01.578
Can you imagine?

27:01.870 --> 27:06.374
The rules that we have in place
are, to effect, a choice from the people

27:06.458 --> 27:10.128
to be affirmed or not by the delegates
and super delegates

27:10.211 --> 27:12.088
and it is not automatic.

27:12.172 --> 27:13.840
Well, then what's the point
of the primaries, really?

27:14.174 --> 27:15.342
Is it just a guide?

27:15.425 --> 27:18.511
If the delegates are free to ignore
the popular vote,

27:18.595 --> 27:21.556
then does that not violate
"one man, one vote"?

27:21.640 --> 27:24.768
Well, it's never truly been one man,
one vote in this country.

27:24.851 --> 27:25.727
Let's face it.

27:25.810 --> 27:28.813
Look, I grew up in California,
my wife in Wyoming.

27:28.897 --> 27:33.109
Now, in my home state, there are
about 15 million registered voters.

27:33.401 --> 27:35.737
In my wife's, maybe 250,000.

27:36.279 --> 27:38.323
Both states have two senators.

27:38.406 --> 27:42.619
Which means my wife had about 60 times
more voting power than I did

27:42.952 --> 27:44.621
in any senatorial election.

27:44.704 --> 27:46.748
Is that fair? I think so.

27:46.831 --> 27:48.375
Perfect? Of course not.

27:48.458 --> 27:52.879
Democracy isn't,
nor is the democratic nomination process.

27:53.254 --> 27:55.423
Nobody here is denying that.

27:55.507 --> 27:58.968
But let's remember, if it wasn't
for delegate independence,

27:59.052 --> 28:01.721
its possibility of back-room deal-making,

28:02.180 --> 28:06.434
the nominee for president in 1932
for the Democratic Party

28:06.518 --> 28:08.103
would've been Newton Baker.

28:08.186 --> 28:12.774
Instead, we got Franklin Delano Roosevelt.

28:15.652 --> 28:19.114
My mother's friend, Vivian, once told me,

28:19.197 --> 28:21.241
"There are only two kinds of people
in this world, Alan.

28:21.324 --> 28:23.576
Them that drink Coke
and them that drink Pepsi."

28:23.660 --> 28:26.204
Vivian got that notion, of course,
from Coke and Pepsi.

28:26.287 --> 28:29.541
There may have been other colas,
but Coke and Pepsi were the giants,

28:29.624 --> 28:31.251
billion-dollar behemoths

28:31.584 --> 28:33.920
who, in their own advertising,
would each refer to the other guy

28:34.003 --> 28:35.422
as the only alternative,

28:35.505 --> 28:39.008
just so long as people keep on gulping
down one or the other.

28:39.092 --> 28:40.844
Makes you kind of wonder
if they're in cahoots.

28:40.927 --> 28:46.558
Mr. Shore, as much as I enjoy listening
to you go on and on and on,

28:47.225 --> 28:48.810
could you get to your case?

28:49.227 --> 28:50.687
When it comes to presidential elections,

28:50.770 --> 28:53.857
we, again, have only
two billion-dollar giants in control.

28:53.940 --> 28:56.317
The American people might get to vote
for commander-in-chief,

28:56.401 --> 28:58.236
but they only get two choices, Your Honor,

28:58.319 --> 29:02.115
choices selected
by two very private organizations

29:02.198 --> 29:05.034
who are both in bed
with big oil, big tobacco,

29:05.118 --> 29:07.078
big pharmaceuticals, big banking.

29:07.162 --> 29:08.371
Every big you can think of.

29:08.455 --> 29:10.540
And as a result,
we only get the candidates

29:10.623 --> 29:13.960
that big business and the two parties
decide to favor us with.

29:14.043 --> 29:15.378
So, where's the democracy?

29:15.920 --> 29:19.716
The sad fact is, it seems that democracy
has lost its way.

29:19.799 --> 29:22.010
And as long as we remain
a two-party system,

29:22.093 --> 29:25.638
we will forever be denied a taste
of that delicious RC Cola

29:25.722 --> 29:27.474
because Coke and Pepsi
have cornered the market.

29:28.475 --> 29:29.851
No more soda pop!

29:29.934 --> 29:32.771
Yes, let's let
the Democratic National Committee

29:32.854 --> 29:34.272
make whatever rules it fancies.

29:34.355 --> 29:37.567
Never mind that delegates like Mitchy
can ignore election results.

29:37.650 --> 29:41.321
Who cares that states like Florida
and Michigan are discounted?

29:41.404 --> 29:45.408
Big deal that in Iowa, the Democrats
don't get to cast secret ballots.

29:45.492 --> 29:48.119
Or that in Nevada,
the caucuses were on a Saturday,

29:48.203 --> 29:49.996
which meant observant Jews couldn't vote.

29:50.079 --> 29:51.331
Hey, it's kind of fun.

29:51.414 --> 29:54.125
This year, the Democratic nominee
might be decided

29:54.209 --> 29:56.085
by super-duper delegates,

29:56.169 --> 29:58.922
political insiders who don't have
to listen to the voters at all,

29:59.005 --> 30:01.674
insiders who, according to DNC rules,

30:01.758 --> 30:04.219
are allowed to and do accept money
from the candidates,

30:04.302 --> 30:08.515
insiders who, in fact, have accepted
over a million dollars

30:08.598 --> 30:10.058
from the Clinton and Obama campaigns.

30:10.141 --> 30:12.977
Do we have to sit here
and listen to this wonkish analysis?

30:13.061 --> 30:15.146
There are dire consequences here,
Mr. Duprey.

30:15.230 --> 30:18.775
Presidents get to start wars,
and kids, the innocent kind, die in them.

30:19.108 --> 30:21.152
Lots of kids.

30:21.236 --> 30:25.156
And as long as presidents get to start
wars and pick Supreme Court justices,

30:25.240 --> 30:28.451
as long as they represent
the American people to the world,

30:28.535 --> 30:31.579
a world which increasingly loathes us
because of our presidents,

30:31.663 --> 30:33.122
we, the people, should get to weigh in.

30:33.206 --> 30:36.626
Look at the choices this grand two-party
system has produced this year.

30:36.709 --> 30:39.087
A grumpy old man
who wants to stay at war for 100 years

30:39.504 --> 30:41.089
versus whomever the Democrats pick,

30:41.172 --> 30:43.091
a choice which may very well
come down to Mitchy.

30:43.174 --> 30:44.384
Snidey butt!

30:46.344 --> 30:47.178
(scoffs)

30:47.971 --> 30:52.267
I'm going to sit my snidey butt down now
after one final thought.

30:52.517 --> 30:55.395
Maybe it's time for us
to take a little break from Iraq

30:55.478 --> 30:57.480
and start spreading
a little more democracy at home.

31:08.408 --> 31:09.659
So what happens now?

31:09.742 --> 31:14.831
Well, we have a drink,
maybe a little sex--

31:14.914 --> 31:15.748
(giggles)

31:16.374 --> 31:18.751
Although it's only been a day
and I'm still in refractory mode.

31:18.835 --> 31:20.879
-No, I mean about the case.
-Oh.

31:20.962 --> 31:24.465
Well, uh, Sack will give
a summation tomorrow.

31:24.966 --> 31:28.553
It'll be boring, full of legal stuff
I never listen to, the judge will rule,

31:29.178 --> 31:32.473
then we'll, uh, marry.

31:40.732 --> 31:41.900
You're even a good kisser.

31:45.945 --> 31:50.909
Sunny, you've been regarding
my flirtations

31:50.992 --> 31:54.037
as, uh, foreplay.

31:55.371 --> 31:56.664
It's more than that.

31:57.373 --> 31:59.125
When a man loves a woman,

31:59.208 --> 32:02.503
when God didn't pick little green apples,

32:04.297 --> 32:05.131
whatever...

32:09.761 --> 32:11.763
Oh, Denny!

32:13.348 --> 32:14.182
Sunny--

32:15.642 --> 32:16.643
-(bones cracking)
-Ooh!

32:21.898 --> 32:24.609
(sighs) Well, you get the idea.

32:26.402 --> 32:27.236
Sunny...

32:33.326 --> 32:34.786
Sunny Fields, will you marry me?

32:34.869 --> 32:38.706
Oh, Denny, we haven't even been out
on a real date.

32:38.790 --> 32:40.375
Oh, we got plenty of time for that.

32:40.458 --> 32:43.378
Oh, Denny.

32:44.671 --> 32:45.505
I love you.

32:48.007 --> 32:49.926
I'd go to the ends of the earth for you.

32:51.803 --> 32:55.556
Well, you sure make it hard to say no to,
I can tell you that.

32:57.433 --> 32:58.726
Can I think about it overnight?

33:01.771 --> 33:02.605
You can.

33:03.690 --> 33:06.901
-And I'll see you tomorrow?
-I promise.

33:12.198 --> 33:13.032
Good night...

33:14.409 --> 33:15.743
Denny Crane.

33:40.268 --> 33:41.644
I agree with Mr. Shore.

33:42.645 --> 33:45.314
Whatever one wants to call
this nomination process,

33:45.898 --> 33:47.400
it's anything but democratic.

33:48.693 --> 33:51.654
Two political parties pulling the strings.

33:52.113 --> 33:53.823
It's like going to a fast-food restaurant

33:53.906 --> 33:55.366
and being told you can eat
whatever you want.

33:57.160 --> 33:58.661
The menu is fixed.

33:59.829 --> 34:00.955
That having been said,

34:01.414 --> 34:05.126
being a private organization,
the DNC is free to set its own rules.

34:06.044 --> 34:10.715
The only real recourse the people have,
I suppose, is to vote Republican.

34:11.507 --> 34:15.928
And everyone wonders how we ended up
with the likes of George Bush.

34:17.388 --> 34:18.848
-Motion denied.
-(gavel thuds)

34:19.724 --> 34:21.809
Everybody loses.

34:23.895 --> 34:24.771
Well...

34:26.481 --> 34:29.150
The one time I get out
of my tastefully decorated office

34:29.233 --> 34:31.027
to tilt at windmills, and I lose.

34:31.861 --> 34:32.695
I'm sorry.

34:36.491 --> 34:41.704
First of all, I reject the idea
that cloning meat is abusive to cows.

34:42.121 --> 34:43.748
-Why?
-It's meat.

34:43.831 --> 34:45.333
The animal's already dead.

34:45.416 --> 34:48.711
No, Your Honor. It's the cow being cloned
to make the meat.

34:49.045 --> 34:50.463
Did I skip over that?

34:50.838 --> 34:52.548
Dead meat is dead meat.

34:52.632 --> 34:53.925
But... (sighs)

34:54.008 --> 34:56.385
Judgment in favor of the plaintiff.

34:56.469 --> 34:57.553
Oh, there you go.

34:57.637 --> 35:01.224
What-- Judge, we had the same concerns
over artificial insemination

35:01.307 --> 35:03.559
and all the perceived horrors,
and nothing bad happened.

35:03.643 --> 35:05.812
-Judgment for the defendant.
-What?

35:06.646 --> 35:10.149
Whoa, no, no, no. Technology
has not improved the food supply.

35:10.233 --> 35:12.944
-Plaintiff's motion granted.
-Wait.

35:13.027 --> 35:15.029
-You said the defendant's.
-Sustained.

35:15.404 --> 35:19.158
-This guy's worse than me.
-I am the decider.

35:21.494 --> 35:22.328
Adjourned.

35:24.497 --> 35:26.415
-Who won?
-I have no idea.

35:29.794 --> 35:33.172
-So, you have no idea if you won or lost?
-No.

35:33.256 --> 35:35.049
(both chuckle)

35:35.341 --> 35:36.634
I still got the girl though.

35:37.343 --> 35:39.512
When do I get to meet her?

35:39.595 --> 35:42.306
Well, she's due any second.

35:42.390 --> 35:44.559
Alan, I popped the question.

35:46.144 --> 35:48.187
-You did what?
-I love her.

35:49.480 --> 35:52.275
-You asked her to marry you?
-Life is short.

35:52.358 --> 35:55.820
No, Denny. Life can be very long.

35:55.903 --> 35:59.031
Especially when you're bound by law
to the wrong woman.

35:59.115 --> 36:00.908
-You can't--
-She's the right woman.

36:00.992 --> 36:02.952
-You just met her.
-I have a feeling.

36:03.035 --> 36:07.331
Yes, the same one you had about Bev
and five other right women

36:07.415 --> 36:09.584
who turned out to be total disasters.

36:10.418 --> 36:11.294
SUNNY: Knock, knock.

36:11.919 --> 36:14.005
Can't. Still in refractory. (chuckles)

36:15.298 --> 36:18.050
-You must be Sunny.
-Oh, my Sunny.

36:18.801 --> 36:20.469
This is Alan Shore. He was just leaving.

36:21.721 --> 36:23.848
-Howdy, Alan.
-Howdy.

36:24.223 --> 36:25.266
Well, we'll talk later.

36:25.349 --> 36:27.393
-I really think we should talk--
-No, no. Later.

36:33.399 --> 36:35.067
Have we figured out
whether we won our case yet?

36:35.735 --> 36:36.611
Not yet.

36:38.779 --> 36:40.489
So, did I win the girl?

36:41.699 --> 36:45.745
Denny, were you serious when you said
you'd go to the ends of the earth for me?

36:46.162 --> 36:46.996
I was.

36:47.872 --> 36:50.917
-How about Montana?
-What?

36:51.334 --> 36:52.877
I'm moving to Montana in a month.

36:52.960 --> 36:56.214
I would've told you sooner,
but things were going so fast between us.

36:56.964 --> 36:58.633
-Montana?
-I bought a farm there.

36:58.716 --> 37:00.551
Six thousand acres of land.

37:00.635 --> 37:03.471
I'm gonna move my ranch there
and really make a go of it.

37:03.930 --> 37:06.474
-Montana?
-So, the question becomes,

37:07.016 --> 37:09.810
are you really that much of a cowboy,
Denny Crane?

37:12.355 --> 37:13.189
What?

37:15.858 --> 37:16.692
Well, uh...

37:18.236 --> 37:19.320
my life is here.

37:19.820 --> 37:22.698
Well, one day,
you will have to go to pasture.

37:23.282 --> 37:24.700
Maybe now's the time.

37:26.369 --> 37:28.663
Ride into the sunset with me, Denny Crane.

37:32.500 --> 37:34.126
See, it's... it's, um...

37:36.379 --> 37:37.296
It's not the job.

37:38.714 --> 37:39.799
It's someone else.

37:42.426 --> 37:45.137
Oh. Someone else.

37:45.221 --> 37:48.057
Uh, my best friend.
That was him you just met.

37:49.934 --> 37:51.269
Are you serious?

37:52.687 --> 37:55.982
See, uh, we meet every night

37:56.065 --> 37:59.568
for, uh, cigars and scotch.

37:59.944 --> 38:01.654
It's a standing...

38:03.364 --> 38:06.617
-Why don't you stay here?
-I just bought a business.

38:09.120 --> 38:10.162
I have to go.

38:13.666 --> 38:16.711
If you'd rather stay and drink scotch
and smoke cigars,

38:16.794 --> 38:19.338
well, maybe that tells us something.

38:19.422 --> 38:23.050
But this has no bearing
on my love for you.

38:25.428 --> 38:27.305
-It's just--
-Your love for him.

38:31.642 --> 38:35.313
I can't go to Montana.

38:49.827 --> 38:51.579
Just like that, it's over?

38:54.165 --> 38:56.292
She turned me down. What can I do?

38:59.837 --> 39:01.714
-I'm sorry, Denny.
-No, you're not.

39:02.882 --> 39:05.343
-You're relieved.
-Well, I'm that, too.

39:05.426 --> 39:07.928
But if you truly loved her,
then I am sorry.

39:10.973 --> 39:13.642
-Denny?
-There's no need to be sorry, Alan.

39:14.185 --> 39:18.522
Love, even when it's fleeting,
even if it's for a day or two, it's...

39:21.442 --> 39:22.818
it's everything.

39:26.614 --> 39:28.032
Don't you agree?

39:32.036 --> 39:36.123
I do. I actually think it's why
I'm still single.

39:38.918 --> 39:41.879
Every morning I get to wake up and wonder,
"Will this be the day?"

39:41.962 --> 39:47.176
Every night I put my head on my pillow
and wonder, "Will I meet her tomorrow?"

39:47.968 --> 39:49.762
I imagine what she'll look like.

39:50.429 --> 39:54.308
Her smile, the way she does her hair,
how she laughs,

39:56.143 --> 39:59.063
the contour of her breasts, neck.

40:02.108 --> 40:05.111
The promise of love can be everything.

40:08.364 --> 40:11.534
It's a magic you rarely find in marriage
though. Maybe you lucked out.

40:11.617 --> 40:15.413
You don't believe married people
can stay in love?

40:15.746 --> 40:16.580
Oh.

40:18.290 --> 40:21.252
I believe they can know
even more profound joys,

40:21.335 --> 40:23.087
be it with children,

40:24.630 --> 40:26.173
the depth of the relationship itself.

40:26.257 --> 40:29.969
It can evolve into something
they can't possibly live without.

40:30.761 --> 40:34.432
Yet, it's something that doesn't quite

40:35.724 --> 40:38.394
so resemble love.

40:39.353 --> 40:41.272
At least not the romance of love.

40:41.856 --> 40:44.608
-I never knew you to be such a romantic.
-(scoffs)

40:45.734 --> 40:47.403
My problem is I'm too romantic.

40:48.362 --> 40:51.031
No woman can possibly measure up
to the promise of tomorrow

40:51.115 --> 40:52.408
that love holds for me.

40:54.952 --> 40:55.870
What about me?

40:57.455 --> 40:58.747
Well, it's not the same.

41:01.375 --> 41:05.087
-You know one thing I do love about you?
-Tell me.

41:06.088 --> 41:09.133
While many people embrace
the promise of tomorrow,

41:10.384 --> 41:13.095
too few celebrate the...

41:14.388 --> 41:16.223
joy of now.

41:16.849 --> 41:20.686
And nobody does that like Denny Crane.

41:23.397 --> 41:24.857
Well, let me tell you something.

41:25.983 --> 41:30.196
When you got polar ice caps melting
and breaking off into big chunks,

41:30.279 --> 41:33.824
and you got Osama still hiding in a cave
planning his next attack,

41:33.908 --> 41:36.952
when you got other rogue nations
with nuclear arsenals,

41:37.036 --> 41:41.081
and not to mention
some whack-job homegrown

41:41.165 --> 41:45.794
who can cancel you at any second,
and when you got...

41:48.088 --> 41:49.006
mad cow...

41:51.050 --> 41:53.719
"now" gets high priority.

41:54.845 --> 41:58.766
And when you're sitting on the balcony
on a clear night,

42:01.060 --> 42:02.937
sipping scotch with your best friend,

42:07.399 --> 42:09.944
"now" is everything.

42:13.989 --> 42:14.823
Here's to now.

42:17.993 --> 42:19.203
Here's to now.

42:31.882 --> 42:33.801
MALE NARRATOR:<i> Two weeks</i>
<i>from tonight on </i>Boston Legal...

42:33.884 --> 42:35.761
-May I help you?
-I seek to be a priest.

42:35.844 --> 42:40.182
Of all the ridiculous, sacrilegious acts
of heresy I've ever heard!

42:40.266 --> 42:41.350
God beckoned me.

42:41.433 --> 42:43.644
-I was arrested last night.
-I don't think we can represent you.

42:44.103 --> 42:46.772
They'll most likely ask you to flip
your employer, and that would be Lorraine.

42:46.855 --> 42:48.399
You kept from me you were a call girl.

42:48.482 --> 42:50.651
I won't be judged for it,
especially by you.

42:50.734 --> 42:52.653
How would you feel
about running for president?

42:52.736 --> 42:54.280
-President?
-Do they know you have mad cow?

42:54.363 --> 42:56.073
They're looking
for the next Ronald Reagan.

42:56.156 --> 42:58.284
Ronald Reagan didn't have a hooker fetish.

42:58.367 --> 43:00.286
Denny Crane, commander-in-chief.

43:00.369 --> 43:01.704
I like it.

43:03.205 --> 43:05.207
(closing theme playing)
