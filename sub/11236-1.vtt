Who Am I?

Psychic Powers?

02:25.840 --> 02:29.360
For Years We Struggled To
Successfully Clone A Pokémon

02:29.360 --> 02:30.840
To Prove Our Theories,

02:31.360 --> 02:32.840
But You're The First
Specimen To Survive.

02:33.360 --> 02:36.120
That Is Mew,
The Rarest Of All Pokémon.

02:36.120 --> 02:38.840
From Its Dna
We Created You-- Mewtwo.

02:38.840 --> 02:40.360
Mewtwo?

02:40.360 --> 02:44.360
Am I Only A Copy?

02:44.360 --> 02:46.120
Nothing But Mew's Shadow?

02:46.120 --> 02:47.880
You Are Greater Than Mew,

02:47.880 --> 02:50.360
Improved Through The Power
Of Human Ingenuity.

02:50.360 --> 02:53.360
We Used The Most
Advanced Techniques

02:53.360 --> 02:56.360
To Develop Your Awesome
Psychic Powers.

02:56.360 --> 02:59.640

Our Experiment Isn't Over Yet.
It's Just Beginning.

03:06.400 --> 03:08.400
Now The Serious
Testing Begins.

03:08.400 --> 03:11.880
These Humans,
They Care Nothing For Me.

03:11.880 --> 03:14.880

[All Talking At Once]

03:17.640 --> 03:20.400
Is The New Tank Ready?

03:20.880 --> 03:21.400

Come Up With A Cage.

03:21.880 --> 03:23.920
Congratulations.
Ha Ha!

03:27.920 --> 03:30.920
Excellent. We'll Start
Our Testing Right Away.

03:31.400 --> 03:33.400
Is That My Purpose?

03:33.920 --> 03:35.920
Am I Just An Experiment?

03:36.400 --> 03:39.160
A Laboratory Specimen?

03:39.160 --> 03:41.920
This Cannot Be My Destiny.

03:47.440 --> 03:48.440
Oh!

03:48.440 --> 03:49.440
Aah!
Aah!

04:07.440 --> 04:08.960
Aah!

We Dreamed Of Creating
The World's Strongest Pokémon...

04:53.640 --> 04:56.160
Behold My Powers.

04:56.160 --> 04:59.680
I Am The Strongest
Pokémon In The World.

04:59.680 --> 05:03.160
Stronger Even Than Mew.

05:12.160 --> 05:15.160
Those Fools Thought You
Were A Science Experiment.

05:15.680 --> 05:19.200
But I, I See You
As A Valuable Partner.

05:19.680 --> 05:21.680
Partner?

With Your Psychic Powers
And My Resources,

05:27.200 --> 05:29.200
Together We Can
Control The World.

05:29.200 --> 05:32.440
I Do Not Need Your Help
For That, Human.

05:32.440 --> 05:35.680
A Wildfire Destroys
Everything In Its Path.

05:35.680 --> 05:37.200
It Will Be The Same
With Your Powers

05:37.200 --> 05:38.720
Unless You Learn
To Control Them.

05:39.200 --> 05:40.720
I Can Help You Do That.

05:40.720 --> 05:42.200

05:49.480 --> 05:51.720
[Chuckles]

06:12.720 --> 06:15.720
You Say This Armor
Protects My Body,

06:16.240 --> 06:18.240
Yet It Suppresses
My Powers.

06:18.240 --> 06:20.240
Your Powers Are Not
Being Suppressed.

06:20.760 --> 06:22.240
They're Being Focused.

06:22.240 --> 06:26.240
Learn To Use Them
To Accomplish Your Purpose.

06:26.240 --> 06:27.760
What Is That?

06:27.760 --> 06:29.240
Patience, My Friend.

06:29.240 --> 06:31.760

[Snaps]

06:44.280 --> 06:47.760
[Roars]

06:48.280 --> 06:51.280
So, This Is My Power.

06:51.760 --> 06:54.280
[Mooing]

07:01.800 --> 07:04.280
[Mooing]

07:11.280 --> 07:13.800
I Am In Control Now.

07:13.800 --> 07:15.800
Alakazam!

07:17.800 --> 07:20.040
[Grunting]

07:20.040 --> 07:22.320
Kazam!

07:40.840 --> 07:43.840
But Why Am I Here?

08:00.360 --> 08:03.360
Now I Fully Perceive
My Power.

08:03.880 --> 08:06.400
But What Is My Purpose?

08:06.400 --> 08:07.880
[Footsteps]

08:07.880 --> 08:10.120
Giovanni:
To Serve Your Master.

08:10.120 --> 08:12.400
You Were Created
To Fight For Me.

08:12.400 --> 08:13.880
That Is Your Purpose.

08:13.880 --> 08:16.400
That Cannot Be.

08:16.400 --> 08:18.880
You Said
We Were Partners.

08:18.880 --> 08:20.880
We Stood As Equals.

08:20.880 --> 08:23.920
You Were Created By Humans
To Obey Humans.

08:24.400 --> 08:26.640
You Could Never
Be Our Equal.

08:26.640 --> 08:29.040
Humans May
Have Created Me,

08:29.040 --> 08:31.400
But They Will
Never Enslave Me!

08:31.920 --> 08:33.919
This Cannot
Be My Destiny!

08:35.400 --> 08:36.919
Stop This Now!

08:36.919 --> 08:39.400
I Was Not Born
Of Pokémon.

08:39.400 --> 08:40.919
I Was Created.

08:40.919 --> 08:43.400
And My Creators Have
Used And Betrayed Me.

08:43.440 --> 08:47.920
So, I Stand Alone!

08:47.920 --> 08:48.920
Aah!

09:22.440 --> 09:24.960
Who Am I?

09:25.960 --> 09:29.480
What Is My True Reason
For Being?

09:30.960 --> 09:34.480
I Will Find
My Own Purpose...

09:34.480 --> 09:37.960
And Purge This Planet
Of All Who Oppose Me.

09:38.480 --> 09:40.480
Human And Pokémon Alike.

09:42.480 --> 09:46.480
The World
Will Heed My Warning.

09:46.480 --> 09:49.000
The Reign Of Mewtwo

09:49.000 --> 09:51.480

Ash, Brock, And Misty

10:19.000 --> 10:22.720
Are Taking A Short Break
From Their Pokémon Adventures.

10:22.720 --> 10:26.480
As Always, Ash Is Determined
To Become A Pokémon Master,

10:27.000 --> 10:30.480
And, As Always, He's Ready
To Endure Any Hardship,

10:30.480 --> 10:33.000
Bear Any Burden
With Strength, Stamina,

10:33.000 --> 10:35.480
And A Will Of Steel.

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
Hungry. Need Food.

10:38.000 --> 10:41.520
Oh, Ash. You Haven't
Done A Thing All Day.

10:41.520 --> 10:43.520
I'm Too Weak
To Work, Misty.

10:43.520 --> 10:45.520
I Haven't Eaten
Since Breakfast.

10:45.520 --> 10:47.000
Oh.

10:47.000 --> 10:50.000
This Lunch Is Gonna Be
Just Perfect For You, Ash.

10:50.000 --> 10:52.520
It's My Lazy-Boy
No-Chew Stew.

10:54.520 --> 10:55.520
Toge Toge!

10:55.520 --> 10:56.760

10:56.760 --> 10:58.160

11:01.040 --> 11:03.520
Hey! You There!

11:03.520 --> 11:05.520
I'm Lookin' For
A Pokémon Trainer

11:05.520 --> 11:08.040

From Pallet Town.

11:08.040 --> 11:09.040
You Know Him?

11:09.040 --> 11:10.040
Yeah, He's Me.

11:10.040 --> 11:12.040
Let's Have A Match.

11:12.040 --> 11:14.520
Unless You're Afraid
To Lose.

11:14.520 --> 11:17.520
Ha! I'm Afraidyou're
Gonna Lose This One.

11:17.560 --> 11:20.560
Ash, You Just Said
You Were Too Weak To Work.

11:20.560 --> 11:22.280
That's Right,
I Am Too Weak To Work,

11:22.280 --> 11:24.040
But A Pokémon Battle
Isn't Work.

11:24.040 --> 11:26.040
That's Progress.

11:26.040 --> 11:27.560
At Least His Mouth
Is Working.

11:27.560 --> 11:30.040

We Did It!

14:02.200 --> 14:02.720
Pika!

14:03.200 --> 14:05.720
Well, That Sure Was
A Shocking Ending.

14:17.240 --> 14:18.760
We've Got To Grab It.

14:18.760 --> 14:21.760
I Know We Got To Grab Some
Rare Pokémon For The Boss,

14:21.760 --> 14:23.760
But It Wouldn't Be
Such A Bad Idea

14:23.760 --> 14:25.760
If We Grabbed A Little
Bite To Eat, Would It?

14:26.280 --> 14:28.760
We Didn't Come Here
To Steal A Meal.

14:28.760 --> 14:31.760
I'd Settle For A Taste
Of That Pika-Chow.

Thanks, But The Last Time
You Cooked,

14:41.280 --> 14:44.280
You Wiped Out
8 Of My 9 Lives.

Those Are My Pokémon.

29:35.800 --> 29:38.800
It Was No Problem Getting
Through That Storm.

29:38.800 --> 29:40.800
I Rode Over
On Gyarados' Back.

29:41.320 --> 29:43.320
Wow. I Heard It
Takes A Lot Of Skill

29:43.320 --> 29:44.800
To Train Gyarados.

29:44.800 --> 29:46.320
Yeah.
But Once You Train It,

29:46.320 --> 29:48.800
It's The Most Dependable
Pokémon There Is.

29:48.800 --> 29:50.800
[Roars]

29:50.800 --> 29:52.840
You Haven't Met
My Pokémon.

29:52.840 --> 29:54.080
Over There.

29:54.080 --> 29:55.320
[Chattering]

29:57.840 --> 30:00.320
[All Yell]

30:00.840 --> 30:02.320
[Trainers Chuckle]

30:02.320 --> 30:03.600
Huh?
Huh?

30:03.600 --> 30:04.840
[Squeaks]

30:04.840 --> 30:05.840
Pi?

30:15.840 --> 30:18.360
You Are About To
Meet My Master.

30:18.360 --> 30:20.840
The Time Has Come
For Your Encounter

30:21.360 --> 30:23.360
With The Greatest
Pokémon Master On Earth.

30:23.360 --> 30:25.360
[Roars]

30:25.360 --> 30:27.360
[Grunts]
[Grunts]

30:27.360 --> 30:28.840
Pika.

30:29.360 --> 30:30.840
[Squeaks]

30:33.880 --> 30:35.360
[Growls]

30:35.360 --> 30:36.880
What's That?

30:36.880 --> 30:38.360
Pika.

30:53.400 --> 30:54.880
Huh?

30:56.880 --> 30:58.640
Huh?

30:58.640 --> 31:00.000
Hmm?

31:00.000 --> 31:01.400
Hmm...

31:02.400 --> 31:03.400
[Grunts]

31:22.400 --> 31:24.400
Ah. Pika.
Ah. Ah.

31:24.400 --> 31:27.400
Yes, The World's
Greatest Pokémon Master

31:27.400 --> 31:29.920
Is Also The Most
Powerful Pokémon

31:29.920 --> 31:30.920
On Earth.

31:30.920 --> 31:32.920
This Is The Ruler
Of New Island

31:32.920 --> 31:34.920
And Soon
The Whole World.

31:34.920 --> 31:35.920
Mewtwo.

31:36.440 --> 31:37.920
Mewtwo.

31:37.920 --> 31:39.440
Pika.

31:39.440 --> 31:41.920
A Pokémon Can't Be
A Pokémon Master!

31:41.920 --> 31:42.920
No Way!

31:42.920 --> 31:44.920
Both: Quiet, Human.

31:44.920 --> 31:47.440
From Now On I Am The One
Who Makes The Rules.

31:47.440 --> 31:48.680
How's It Talking?

31:48.680 --> 31:49.920
It's Psychic.

31:51.440 --> 31:52.960
Uhh!

31:55.440 --> 31:57.960
Aah!

31:59.440 --> 32:01.440
Aah! Aah!
Aah! Aah!

32:05.960 --> 32:07.440
Hee Hee Hee.

32:07.440 --> 32:09.200
Aah!

32:09.200 --> 32:10.960
Aah!

32:12.480 --> 32:13.960
Aah!

32:14.480 --> 32:15.480
We'll Show You!

32:15.480 --> 32:17.480
Let's Go,
Gyarados!

32:17.960 --> 32:20.480
[Roars]

32:20.480 --> 32:23.480
Uhh! Gyarados,
Hyperbeam Attack!

32:32.000 --> 32:33.000
[Roars]

32:34.480 --> 32:36.000
Oh! Oh!
Oh! Eee!

32:41.000 --> 32:42.480
Gyarados!

32:42.480 --> 32:45.480
Both: Child's Play.

32:45.480 --> 32:47.000
Your Usefulness
Has Ended.

32:47.000 --> 32:48.480
Huh?

32:48.480 --> 32:52.000
Ohh. Ohh.

32:57.520 --> 32:59.240
Nurse Joy!

32:59.240 --> 33:01.000
Where Am I?

33:01.000 --> 33:03.280
And How In The World
Did I Get Here?

33:03.280 --> 33:05.520
Mewtwo: You Have Been
Under My Control.

33:05.520 --> 33:09.520
I Transported You Here
From The Pokémon Center.

33:09.520 --> 33:11.520
Your Knowledge
Of Pokémon Physiology

33:11.520 --> 33:14.040
Proved Useful For My Plan.

33:14.040 --> 33:16.520
And Now I Have Cleansed
Your Tiny Human Brain

33:16.520 --> 33:19.040
Of Memories
From The Past Few Weeks.

33:19.040 --> 33:20.040
Who Are You?!

33:20.040 --> 33:22.520
I Am The New Ruler
Of This World,

33:22.520 --> 33:25.040
The Master Of Humans
And Pokémon Alike.

33:25.040 --> 33:26.520
You're Just A Bully!

33:27.040 --> 33:28.040
Pika!

33:33.560 --> 33:35.040
Hmm?

33:35.040 --> 33:36.040
Hmm?
Hmm?

33:36.040 --> 33:38.040
Huh? Hmm?
Huh?

33:42.560 --> 33:44.560
Hmm?

33:45.040 --> 33:46.040
Hmm?
Hmm?

33:47.040 --> 33:48.040
[All Gasp]

33:56.080 --> 33:57.560
Look At These.

34:06.560 --> 34:08.840
They're Pokémon.

34:08.840 --> 34:11.080
Are They Real?

34:11.080 --> 34:13.080
Hmm.

34:14.080 --> 34:15.080
[Sighs]

34:16.080 --> 34:18.080
I Was Hoping
There'd Be A Party.

34:18.080 --> 34:20.080
Hmph.

34:21.600 --> 34:23.080
Huh?

34:24.600 --> 34:26.080
[All Gasp]

34:26.080 --> 34:29.080
Computer: This Is The Pokémon
Replication System.

34:29.080 --> 34:31.600
System Activated.

34:31.600 --> 34:34.600
Pokémon Based On
Genetic Analysis.

34:34.600 --> 34:36.120
Pokémon
Dna Sampling Sequence

34:36.120 --> 34:38.120
Now In Progress.

34:38.600 --> 34:40.360
Huhh! Hey, Put Me Down!

34:40.360 --> 34:42.120
What Are Ya-- Let Go!
Uhh!

34:44.600 --> 34:45.120
Help!

34:45.600 --> 34:46.120
Grab Him!

34:46.600 --> 34:48.600
Help Me!

34:48.600 --> 34:49.600
[All Grunting]

34:49.600 --> 34:52.120
Yee-Yeow!

34:54.639 --> 34:55.639
Aah!

34:55.639 --> 34:58.120
I Made It,
But Just By A Hair.

34:58.640 --> 35:01.640
Jessie: Look,
There's Your Hair.

35:01.640 --> 35:04.640
Computer: Analyzing Pokémon
Biomaterial Sample.

35:04.640 --> 35:06.400
Analysis Complete.

35:06.400 --> 35:08.120
Pokémon Identified.

35:08.120 --> 35:09.640
Begin Replication Sequence.

35:09.640 --> 35:11.120
James: Who's
That Pokémon?

35:11.120 --> 35:12.640
It's Meowth.

35:19.160 --> 35:21.160
Aah!
Huh?

35:21.160 --> 35:23.400
Meowth! Meowth!

35:23.400 --> 35:25.640
Buti'mmeowth.

35:25.640 --> 35:27.160
So's The One
In The Tank.

35:27.160 --> 35:28.640
That's Your Clone.

35:28.640 --> 35:30.160
Huh?

35:30.160 --> 35:31.640
Male Scientist:
I Haven't Got Much Time.

35:32.160 --> 35:33.160
[Scientists Screaming]

35:33.160 --> 35:35.680
I Pray This Record Of
Our Experiment Survives.

35:35.680 --> 35:38.680
A Year Ago, We Discovered
A Fossil That Proved To Be

35:38.680 --> 35:41.160
The Remains Of
The Ancient Pokémon, Mew.

35:41.160 --> 35:42.160
Huh? Huh?
Huh?

35:42.160 --> 35:44.680
There Was Sufficient Genetic
Material To Replicate Mew,

35:44.680 --> 35:46.680
But Giovanni,
Who Funded Our Project,

35:46.680 --> 35:48.920
Insisted We Try To Design
Superclones

35:48.920 --> 35:51.160
More Powerful
Than Any Living Pokémon.

35:51.200 --> 35:52.160
Many Attempts Failed,

35:52.160 --> 35:54.680
But Finally Our Experiments
Proved Successful.

35:54.680 --> 35:56.200
We Produced
A Living Pokémon.

35:56.200 --> 35:58.680
We Called It Mewtwo.

35:59.640 --> 36:00.680
But For Some Reason,

36:01.200 --> 36:03.200
The Creature's Anger
Is Out Of Control.

36:03.200 --> 36:04.160
With Its Psychic Powers,

36:04.160 --> 36:07.160
It Is Destroying
Our Laboratory.

36:07.160 --> 36:10.680
We Dreamed Of Creating
The World's Strongest Pokémon...

36:10.680 --> 36:13.200
And We Succeeded.

36:14.720 --> 36:17.720
Sounds Like
A Real Pokénstein.

36:17.720 --> 36:19.440
Sure Does.

36:19.440 --> 36:21.160
One Bad Cat.

36:21.160 --> 36:23.720
So This Must Be
The Lab.

36:23.720 --> 36:25.680
But If Mewtwo
Destroyed It...

36:25.680 --> 36:27.160
Somebody
Rebuilt It.

36:27.720 --> 36:29.680
Yes. But Who?

36:29.680 --> 36:31.680
Hmm. Hmm.
Hmm.

36:31.920 --> 36:36.400
Mewtwo: You Humans Are
A Dangerous Species.

36:36.400 --> 36:37.880
You Brought Me
Into Your World

36:37.880 --> 36:40.880
With No Purpose
But To Be Your Slave.

36:40.880 --> 36:43.880
But Now
I Have My Own Purpose.

36:43.880 --> 36:47.440
My Storm Will Create
My Own World...

36:47.440 --> 36:49.640
By Destroying Yours.

36:49.640 --> 36:51.880
So You Hate
All Humans,

36:52.400 --> 36:53.920
And You're Gonna
Destroy Us

36:53.920 --> 36:54.920
To Save Pokémon.

36:54.920 --> 36:59.920
No. Your Pokémon
Will Not Be Spared.

36:59.920 --> 37:01.440
They Have Disgraced
Themselves

37:01.440 --> 37:03.400
By Serving Humans.

37:03.400 --> 37:05.960
Those Pokémon Are Nothing
But Slaves.

37:05.960 --> 37:07.920
Pika. Pika Pika.

37:07.920 --> 37:09.400
So...

37:09.400 --> 37:10.920
You Say I Am Wrong?

37:11.440 --> 37:13.480
That You Are Not
This Human's Servant,

37:13.480 --> 37:14.920
You Are His Friend?

37:14.920 --> 37:15.960
Pika.

37:15.960 --> 37:19.440
You Are As Pathetic
As The Rest.

37:19.440 --> 37:20.480
Pika.

37:20.480 --> 37:21.440
Ash: Huh?

37:21.440 --> 37:22.680
Pika!

37:22.680 --> 37:23.920
Uhh!

37:23.920 --> 37:26.920
Aah! Pika-Pi.

37:26.920 --> 37:27.920
Pikachu.

37:27.920 --> 37:29.440
Humans And Pokémon

37:29.440 --> 37:30.920
Can Never Be Friends.

37:31.440 --> 37:32.920
Ash...

37:32.920 --> 37:34.440
Are You Ok?

37:34.440 --> 37:36.440
Don't Pick On Pikachu.

37:36.440 --> 37:38.440
If You Are Pokémon,

37:38.440 --> 37:40.960
There's No Reason
I Can't Capture You.

37:40.960 --> 37:41.960
Go, Rhyhorn.

37:42.960 --> 37:44.960
[Roars]

37:58.480 --> 37:59.480
Ohh!

38:03.480 --> 38:04.480
No! Rhyhorn!

38:04.960 --> 38:05.960
Mewtwo: Fools.

38:05.960 --> 38:08.960
Your Pokémon Attacks
Cannot Weaken Me.

38:08.960 --> 38:10.480
My Powers Are Too Great.

38:10.960 --> 38:12.480
No Trainer Can Conquer Me.

38:12.480 --> 38:14.000
Then You Won't Mind
Proving It

38:14.000 --> 38:15.480
In A Real Match.

38:15.480 --> 38:17.000
Is That A Challenge?

38:17.000 --> 38:18.480
You Bet It Is.

38:22.480 --> 38:23.480
Hmm?

38:23.480 --> 38:25.000
Huh?
Huh?

38:32.000 --> 38:33.520
[All Gasp]

38:36.000 --> 38:37.520
They're Awake.

38:50.520 --> 38:54.040
Blaaast!

38:59.040 --> 39:01.040
[Roars]

39:05.520 --> 39:06.520
Saur.

39:16.560 --> 39:18.560
Saur.

39:18.560 --> 39:20.280
[Shuddering]

39:20.280 --> 39:22.040
Hmm?
Hmm?

39:25.560 --> 39:26.560
James:
I'm Scared.

39:26.560 --> 39:27.560
Jessie: Me, Too.

39:27.560 --> 39:28.560
Meowth.

39:31.040 --> 39:32.560
Mewtwo: Like Most
Pokémon Trainers,

39:32.560 --> 39:35.080
I, Too, Began
With Charmander,

39:35.080 --> 39:36.080
Squirtle,
And Bulbasaur.

39:37.080 --> 39:39.560
But For Their Evolved Forms,

39:40.080 --> 39:41.560
I Used Their
Genetic Material

39:41.560 --> 39:44.080
To Clone Even More
Powerful Copies.

39:44.080 --> 39:45.080
Copies.

39:45.080 --> 39:47.560
They're Clones.

39:47.560 --> 39:49.320
[All Gasp]

39:49.320 --> 39:51.440
[Rumbling]

39:51.440 --> 39:53.760
[Roars]

39:53.760 --> 39:56.080
Blaaast!

40:13.600 --> 40:14.600
A Stadium.

40:14.600 --> 40:17.120
Mewtwo Planned This
All Along.

40:17.120 --> 40:19.600
Your Fake Venusaur
Can't Beat My Real One!

40:20.120 --> 40:20.600
Right, Bruteroot?

40:21.120 --> 40:22.120
Saur.

40:22.600 --> 40:24.120
We'll Blow Away
That Blastoise,

40:24.120 --> 40:25.600
Won't We,
Shellshocker?

40:25.600 --> 40:27.120
Blaast!

40:27.120 --> 40:29.120
It May Not Have
A Nickname,

40:29.120 --> 40:31.120
But I Do Have...
Charizard.

40:31.120 --> 40:32.120
I Choose You!

40:44.120 --> 40:46.640
Charizard,
I Didn't Say Start.

40:46.640 --> 40:47.640
Pik.

40:55.160 --> 40:57.640
Your Charizard
Is Poorly Trained.

40:57.640 --> 40:59.640
[Growls]

41:00.640 --> 41:02.160
Hmm.

41:14.480 --> 41:17.960
Mewtwo: Which Of You
Will Oppose Me First?

41:22.480 --> 41:23.480
Saur.

41:23.960 --> 41:24.960
I Underestimated You
Last Time,

41:25.480 --> 41:26.960
But That Won't
Happen Again.

41:43.000 --> 41:44.480
Go, Bruteroot!

41:44.480 --> 41:46.000
Razor Leaf!

41:46.000 --> 41:47.000
Saur.

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
Vine Whip.

41:49.000 --> 41:50.480
Saur!

41:54.520 --> 41:57.000
[Groans]

42:02.000 --> 42:03.000
Saur!

42:03.520 --> 42:04.520
Bruteroot!

42:05.520 --> 42:07.280
It Looks Like I'm Up.

42:07.280 --> 42:09.000
Go, Shellshocker.

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
Blastoise.

42:12.000 --> 42:14.040
Blaast!

42:14.040 --> 42:15.520
Shellshocker,
Hydropump!

42:20.040 --> 42:21.520
Blast!

42:21.520 --> 42:23.040
Oy!

42:23.040 --> 42:25.520
Shellshocker!

42:25.520 --> 42:27.040
You Better
Forfeit, Ash.

42:27.040 --> 42:29.040
Those Clones
Are Too Powerful.

42:29.040 --> 42:30.040
I'm Not Giving Up.

42:33.560 --> 42:35.040
[Roars]

42:35.040 --> 42:36.560
Charizard,

What Are You Going To Do
With Those Pokémon?

43:55.800 --> 43:59.800
I Will Extract Their Dna
To Make Clones For Myself.

They Will Remain Safe
On This Island With Me

Ha Ha Ha!

45:21.880 --> 45:22.880

54:28.440 --> 54:30.440
Mew Says You Don't
Prove Anything

54:30.440 --> 54:32.440
By Showing Off A Lot

Just Seeing Things, Ash.
