WEBVTT

00:02.536 --> 00:04.672
<i>Previously on</i> The Equalizer...

00:06.840 --> 00:08.008
Madam D.A.

00:08.109 --> 00:09.843
I wasn't expecting
to see you so soon.

00:09.943 --> 00:11.945
That makes two of us.

00:12.046 --> 00:14.515
I don't take meeting
with you lightly.

00:14.615 --> 00:16.284
<i>Dante, I'm on my way to you.</i>

00:16.384 --> 00:18.452
<i>Can you reach Mel?</i>

00:18.552 --> 00:19.987
Go get Randall!

00:21.389 --> 00:22.390
Just don't arrest him.

00:22.490 --> 00:24.458
You said you'd be here.

00:24.558 --> 00:25.759
<i>I had him.</i>

00:25.859 --> 00:27.495
<i>He was right there.</i>

00:27.595 --> 00:28.762
<i>But I let him get away.</i>

00:30.564 --> 00:31.932
I should've taken him down
when I had the chance,

00:32.032 --> 00:34.635
but I let your needs get
in the way of me doing my job.

00:34.735 --> 00:36.270
Now, are you gonna tell
me the truth or no?

00:36.370 --> 00:38.672
I can't.
Okay.

00:38.772 --> 00:40.208
You leave me no choice.

00:40.308 --> 00:41.742
Wait, what's that
supposed to mean?

00:41.842 --> 00:44.712
I'm filing for full
custody of Delilah.

00:51.652 --> 00:53.421
Mr. DeSena, please.

00:53.521 --> 00:56.157
Dr. Keller said this
surgery could save her life.

00:56.257 --> 00:57.425
I'm sorry, Mrs. Stone,

00:57.525 --> 00:58.992
but your insurance
won't cover it.

00:59.093 --> 01:01.729
I'm afraid we have
to discharge Emily.

01:02.996 --> 01:04.132
I want to see Dr. Keller.

01:04.232 --> 01:05.799
Unfortunately, that's
not possible.

01:05.899 --> 01:07.801
But I want to help.
Have you...

01:07.901 --> 01:09.503
spoken to one of
our social workers

01:09.603 --> 01:10.504
about financial aid?

01:10.604 --> 01:12.140
Of course I talked to someone.

01:12.240 --> 01:13.841
They said it could take weeks.

01:13.941 --> 01:15.042
Look at my child.

01:17.678 --> 01:18.946
She doesn't have weeks.

01:19.046 --> 01:22.516
Would this hospital
really sentence her to die?

01:22.616 --> 01:23.751
Over money?

01:23.851 --> 01:26.287
I really am sorry, Mrs. Stone.

01:40.201 --> 01:41.869
Mommy?

01:41.969 --> 01:43.036
Yes, my heart?

01:43.137 --> 01:44.805
Am I going to die?

01:46.006 --> 01:48.742
No. No, silly girl.

01:50.278 --> 01:53.181
Mommy would never
let that happen.

01:53.281 --> 01:55.749
I promise.

02:24.111 --> 02:25.045
Hey!

02:25.145 --> 02:26.514
No one move.

02:26.614 --> 02:28.316
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
She's got a gun!

02:28.416 --> 02:29.383
Mrs. Stone. Please.

02:29.483 --> 02:31.319
No, you listen to me!

02:31.419 --> 02:33.621
Emily will have that surgery!

02:33.721 --> 02:36.690
Or she won't be
the only one to die today!

02:43.030 --> 02:45.299
What do we know?

02:45.399 --> 02:46.767
Armed woman
commandeered the D Ward.

02:46.867 --> 02:48.469
She's the mother
of a patient.

02:48.569 --> 02:50.103
How many hostages?
Five.

02:50.204 --> 02:51.372
As far as
we can tell.

02:51.472 --> 02:52.540
Any patients that
were physically able

02:52.640 --> 02:53.874
have been evacuated,
along with

02:53.974 --> 02:55.142
all nonessential
medical staff.

02:55.243 --> 02:56.777
Hey, Detective.

02:56.877 --> 02:59.213
Perpetrator attempted to make
contact. She sounds antsy.

02:59.313 --> 03:00.914
Maybe you should talk to her
before something happens.

03:01.014 --> 03:03.083
Oh, protocol says
the Apprehension Tac Team

03:03.183 --> 03:04.652
initiates dialogue
in these situations.

03:04.752 --> 03:05.886
That's the problem.

03:05.986 --> 03:07.588
Tac Team's held
up across town.

03:07.688 --> 03:10.157
ETA is 30 minutes, but
even that's up in the air.

03:15.829 --> 03:18.566
This is Detective Marcus Dante
with the NYPD.

03:18.666 --> 03:20.268
Who am I speaking with?

03:20.368 --> 03:21.369
If any of you

03:21.469 --> 03:24.872
move a muscle,
I won't hesitate.

03:24.972 --> 03:27.207
Detective,
my name is Lauren Stone.

03:27.308 --> 03:28.776
Ms. Stone, I'm here to help.

03:28.876 --> 03:30.544
Why don't you tell me
what's going on.

03:30.644 --> 03:33.013
My baby girl is dying
and this hospital

03:33.113 --> 03:35.215
won't do a damn
thing to help her.

03:35.316 --> 03:36.617
I'm sorry.

03:36.717 --> 03:38.085
I can't imagine what
you're going through.

03:38.185 --> 03:40.321
We're gonna get through
this together, Ms. Stone.

03:40.421 --> 03:41.755
But first...

03:41.855 --> 03:45.526
I need you to tell me:
what is it you want?

03:47.661 --> 03:49.997
What...? What do you
have going on?

03:50.097 --> 03:51.532
Looks like the
final round

03:51.632 --> 03:52.966
of <i>Top Chef</i> in here.

03:53.066 --> 03:56.103
My class is having a cultural
heritage potluck.

03:56.203 --> 03:58.506
And, you know, since we
have roots in Louisiana,

03:58.606 --> 04:01.008
I'm making gumbo.

04:01.108 --> 04:03.043
Why didn't you tell me?
I would've helped you.

04:03.143 --> 04:04.845
I know, I just-- I thought
I'd surprise you.

04:04.945 --> 04:07.548
And also I found this bomb
recipe on Bon Appetit, so...

04:09.617 --> 04:10.584
Don't kill her, Aunt Vi.

04:10.684 --> 04:12.219
I swear, I promise you

04:12.320 --> 04:14.488
I raised her better than this.
Since when is

04:14.588 --> 04:17.057
Bon Appetit an
authentic source

04:17.157 --> 04:18.892
for gumbo recipes?

04:19.893 --> 04:20.661
No okra.

04:20.761 --> 04:22.195
No andouille sausage.

04:22.296 --> 04:23.764
No way you
are taking

04:23.864 --> 04:26.967
this knockoff nonsense into
your classroom, representing

04:27.067 --> 04:29.102
this family.
Girl, please.

04:30.871 --> 04:32.340
In fact, put
the knife down.

04:32.440 --> 04:33.774
We're going on
a field trip.

04:33.874 --> 04:36.243
Oh, okay. Wait,
where are we going?

04:36.344 --> 04:38.446
You should've known
better than that.

04:42.350 --> 04:43.851
Marcus.

04:43.951 --> 04:45.786
I've been, uh,
trying to call you.

04:45.886 --> 04:48.021
What's going on?
Been busy, I guess.

04:48.121 --> 04:51.692
Look, I know you blame me
for Randall Grayle's escape,

04:51.792 --> 04:53.327
but we will find him.

04:53.427 --> 04:55.796
That's not why I'm calling.
There's a hostage situation

04:55.896 --> 04:58.298
at Koch University Hospital
in Midtown.

04:58.399 --> 05:00.701
A woman trying to get treatment
for her dying daughter.

05:00.801 --> 05:01.969
Damn. What's her play?

05:02.069 --> 05:03.371
Still trying to figure that out,

05:03.471 --> 05:05.606
but she says she'll only
speak to one person...

05:05.706 --> 05:07.174
the Equalizer.

05:10.878 --> 05:12.813
On my way.

05:15.649 --> 05:16.884
<i>Hey, Rob.</i>

05:16.984 --> 05:17.918
You find anything on
this woman, Harry?

05:18.018 --> 05:19.353
Lauren Stone.

05:19.453 --> 05:20.521
No criminal record.

05:20.621 --> 05:22.322
Widowed with one
child, Emily.

05:22.423 --> 05:23.791
She's 12 years old.

05:23.891 --> 05:26.326
Been diagnosed with an
uncommon brain disease.

05:26.427 --> 05:28.629
Lauren's got a job as
a data analyst at PGT Systems.

05:28.729 --> 05:31.331
According to her
tax returns, she also

05:31.432 --> 05:32.666
works part-time as a waitress

05:32.766 --> 05:33.967
on nights and weekends.

05:34.067 --> 05:35.302
That's a lot of work
for one person.

05:35.403 --> 05:37.405
She must be buried
in hospital bills.

05:37.505 --> 05:38.539
Lauren set up

05:38.639 --> 05:39.973
a GoFundMe campaign

05:40.073 --> 05:41.875
to pay for Emily's surgery.
Must be a nightmare.

05:41.975 --> 05:43.310
Your kid's sick and you can't

05:43.411 --> 05:44.812
do anything to help.

05:44.912 --> 05:46.113
Yeah, I hear that.
Can't imagine if it were mine.

05:46.213 --> 05:47.781
According to this site,

05:47.881 --> 05:50.551
Emily suffers from something
called polymicrogyria.

05:50.651 --> 05:51.685
They've tried treatment

05:51.785 --> 05:53.220
after treatment,
nothing's worked.

05:53.320 --> 05:55.022
This surgery
is their only chance.

05:55.122 --> 05:57.357
I guess the surgery
is really high-risk

05:57.458 --> 05:59.226
and the insurance company's
refused to cover it.

05:59.326 --> 06:00.928
Because the hospital cares
more about their bottom line

06:01.028 --> 06:02.329
than this woman's dying child.

06:02.430 --> 06:03.531
Yeah, I don't know...

06:03.631 --> 06:05.098
It's never okay
to take hostages,

06:05.198 --> 06:06.967
but I got to say,
I feel for this woman.

06:07.067 --> 06:08.869
All right, I'm approaching
the hospital now.

06:08.969 --> 06:10.971
Dante's meeting me there.

06:11.071 --> 06:12.573
Things are better
between you two?

06:13.340 --> 06:16.477
I'm just focusing on the
hostages and that little girl.

06:16.577 --> 06:18.746
Anyway, I'll keep you posted.

06:22.282 --> 06:24.184
What's the status?

06:24.284 --> 06:25.252
We're on pause.

06:25.352 --> 06:26.454
She refuses to
give her demands

06:26.554 --> 06:28.221
until she speaks to you.

06:28.321 --> 06:30.558
Can't believe she had
to go to this length

06:30.658 --> 06:32.025
just to get help
for her daughter.

06:32.125 --> 06:34.294
Let's not make her out to
be a folk hero just yet.

06:34.394 --> 06:35.963
She's putting innocent
lives in danger.

06:36.063 --> 06:38.999
All right. Well, let's see
what we're dealing with.

06:40.801 --> 06:42.402
You Detective Dante?

06:42.503 --> 06:43.804
That's right.

06:43.904 --> 06:45.405
Apprehension Tac Team
Commander Bruce Gregory.

06:45.506 --> 06:46.707
Did I hear correctly that you

06:46.807 --> 06:48.208
made contact
with the hostage-taker?

06:48.308 --> 06:50.077
There was concern she might
act if no one spoke to her.

06:50.177 --> 06:52.546
You do understand there is
a protocol in these situations?

06:52.646 --> 06:53.747
I made a judgment call.

06:53.847 --> 06:55.148
Because you were
late to the scene.

06:55.248 --> 06:56.383
Commander.

06:56.484 --> 06:57.851
What did she say
when you talked to her?

06:57.951 --> 06:59.887
Did she have
any demands?
Yes.

06:59.987 --> 07:00.921
She asked to speak with

07:01.021 --> 07:02.255
her psychotherapist.

07:02.355 --> 07:04.792
Dr. Maggie Robinson
at your service.

07:04.892 --> 07:06.527
She asked for Dr. Robinson.
She was very insistent.

07:06.627 --> 07:09.096
So am I. My negotiator will
take it from here.

07:09.196 --> 07:10.764
I know that's
your protocol.

07:10.864 --> 07:13.000
But it's very important
I speak to my patient.

07:13.100 --> 07:15.469
Obviously, she's
fragile right now.

07:15.569 --> 07:17.971
Due respect, this is a hostage
crisis, not a therapy session.

07:18.071 --> 07:21.141
Due respect, Commander,
but I know what I'm doing.

07:21.241 --> 07:22.843
I have negotiating experience,

07:22.943 --> 07:25.012
military training...
The answer is no.

07:25.112 --> 07:28.048
I need to speak to her.
And it needs to be face-to-face.

07:28.148 --> 07:30.283
Wait. You want to go in there?

07:30.383 --> 07:31.418
Just give me a chance.

07:31.519 --> 07:33.621
I'm sure I can
resolve this peacefully.

07:33.721 --> 07:35.523
I know it's unorthodox, Commander,

07:35.623 --> 07:36.957
but at least hear her out.

07:39.026 --> 07:40.728
Now let me be crystal clear.

07:40.828 --> 07:42.796
I don't care what
your training is.

07:42.896 --> 07:44.598
Either your patient
negotiates with us,

07:44.698 --> 07:47.167
or we'll be the ones
going in there.

07:49.002 --> 07:50.671
And if you get in my way,

07:50.771 --> 07:52.472
I will have you arrested.

08:10.390 --> 08:12.626
We got to get in there.

08:12.726 --> 08:15.796
How, if he won't let you
in to talk to her?

08:19.767 --> 08:21.101
Something's off.

08:21.201 --> 08:23.704
They don't look like
they're about to negotiate.

08:23.804 --> 08:25.706
Protocol says they need
to exhaust all

08:25.806 --> 08:27.841
negotiating
options first. Exactly.

08:27.941 --> 08:29.777
So why do they look like
they're preparing to breach?

08:29.877 --> 08:31.144
I don't know.

08:31.244 --> 08:32.780
But if Lauren won't
talk to anyone but you,

08:32.880 --> 08:34.481
there's no telling
what she'll do.

08:38.318 --> 08:40.854
There may be a way.

08:47.861 --> 08:49.863
What a surprise.
It's been a while.

08:49.963 --> 08:52.099
Look, um, I could use
your help, D.A. Grafton.

08:52.199 --> 08:54.001
You got a minute?

08:54.101 --> 08:57.237
Sure, but fair warning:
my coffee hasn't kicked in yet.

08:57.337 --> 08:58.772
Okay, well...

08:58.872 --> 09:01.374
You know the standoff
at Koch University Hospital?

09:01.474 --> 09:03.310
I'm aware. What about it?

09:03.410 --> 09:04.778
Best I can tell,
we're dealing with a woman

09:04.878 --> 09:06.046
who's scared for her daughter,

09:06.146 --> 09:07.080
not looking to hurt anyone.

09:07.180 --> 09:08.381
How do you know this?

09:08.481 --> 09:09.683
Well, she asked
for me specifically.

09:09.783 --> 09:11.084
That tells me
I can talk her down.

09:11.184 --> 09:14.221
The problem is, Tac Team won't

09:14.321 --> 09:15.255
let me in the building.

09:15.355 --> 09:16.757
And you want me to get you in?

09:16.857 --> 09:19.660
Well, I think this thing
can be resolved peacefully.

09:19.760 --> 09:21.428
And what does Tac Team
think about it?

09:21.528 --> 09:22.462
That's the thing.

09:22.562 --> 09:23.897
Instead of negotiating,

09:23.997 --> 09:25.866
they look like they're
preparing to breach.

09:25.966 --> 09:26.900
Which tells me

09:27.000 --> 09:28.068
there's something else going on

09:28.168 --> 09:29.737
that we may not know about.

09:29.837 --> 09:31.138
All right, I can make
a few phone calls,

09:31.238 --> 09:32.806
see what I can find out.
But getting you in...

09:32.906 --> 09:36.276
Avery, that little girl
needs treatment and fast.

09:36.376 --> 09:39.012
And we both know
if Tac goes in...

09:39.112 --> 09:40.547
it'll get messy.

09:40.648 --> 09:43.717
If I go in, I can save
those hostages and...

09:43.817 --> 09:45.585
maybe help that little girl.

09:47.020 --> 09:49.823
No promises.
I'll see what I can do.

09:49.923 --> 09:51.792
I appreciate it.

10:03.036 --> 10:05.172
Auntie, you okay?

10:05.272 --> 10:07.174
Yeah. I'm fine.

10:07.274 --> 10:09.977
You are in for
quite the treat.

10:10.077 --> 10:12.312
Come on.

10:13.681 --> 10:14.848
Okay...

10:14.948 --> 10:16.984
This is a vibe.

10:17.084 --> 10:19.119
No, honey, it's
more than a vibe,

10:19.219 --> 10:20.854
it's a neighborhood institution.

10:20.954 --> 10:24.792
A cultural touchstone,
owned by the same family

10:24.892 --> 10:26.126
for almost a hundred years.

10:26.226 --> 10:28.696
This place is as
important to our community

10:28.796 --> 10:30.831
as the food it serves.

10:33.633 --> 10:35.035
Oh, hello.
Oh, we will not

10:35.135 --> 10:37.437
be needing those.
We're here for the gumbo.

10:37.537 --> 10:38.739
Sorry, we don't have gumbo.

10:38.839 --> 10:41.208
You sold out already?
It's barely noon.

10:41.308 --> 10:42.676
It-It's not on the menu.

10:44.011 --> 10:45.212
All right...

10:45.312 --> 10:46.313
Then, well, let's

10:46.413 --> 10:47.715
take a look.

10:51.218 --> 10:55.222
Tofurkey sandwich?

10:55.322 --> 10:56.456
And, uh...

10:56.556 --> 10:58.391
beefless stew?

10:58.491 --> 11:00.227
Those are two of
our more popular

11:00.327 --> 11:01.929
vegan and gluten-free options.

11:02.029 --> 11:05.365
I'm so sorry, but
is Audrey still the owner here?

11:05.465 --> 11:09.102
Uh... Unfortunately,
Audrey passed away last year.

11:10.170 --> 11:12.005
Oh, my...

11:14.307 --> 11:16.676
I am so sorry to hear that.

11:16.777 --> 11:18.645
Her son Nelson
runs the place now.

11:18.746 --> 11:21.581
Well, in that case,

11:21.681 --> 11:24.317
I'm going to need
to speak with him.

11:29.689 --> 11:31.191
Dante. Didn't expect
to see you here.

11:31.291 --> 11:33.460
Swanson, didn't think
you could get rid of me

11:33.560 --> 11:34.928
by transferring out, did you?

11:35.028 --> 11:37.464
Heard you landed
with the Tac Team.

11:37.564 --> 11:39.132
Can I ask you a question?

11:39.232 --> 11:41.168
Why's your team getting
ready to go in so fast?

11:41.268 --> 11:43.904
We were told some crazy woman
grabbed a security guard's gun

11:44.004 --> 11:45.672
and that we should
be prepared to breach.

11:45.773 --> 11:46.673
She's a mother trying
to get treatment

11:46.774 --> 11:47.640
for her dying daughter.

11:47.741 --> 11:48.675
Not for me to sort out.

11:48.776 --> 11:51.011
I'm just following orders.

11:57.184 --> 11:58.518
You learn anything?

11:58.618 --> 12:00.520
I talked to the chief of police.
And you were right.

12:00.620 --> 12:02.522
Something bigger is
definitely going on here.

12:02.622 --> 12:03.556
He's getting pressure
from the governor

12:03.656 --> 12:04.758
to resolve this quickly.

12:04.858 --> 12:05.993
Why?

12:06.093 --> 12:07.928
He wouldn't say.
But he owes me a favor,

12:08.028 --> 12:09.496
so he's agreed...

12:09.596 --> 12:11.965
to stall Commander Gregory's
Tac Team and let you inside.

12:12.065 --> 12:13.433
All right,
thanks for your help, Avery.

12:13.533 --> 12:14.701
I really appreciate you.

12:14.802 --> 12:16.436
Don't let this blow up
in my face.

12:16.536 --> 12:18.105
I won't.

12:18.205 --> 12:20.673
Just got off the phone
with Deputy Chief.

12:20.774 --> 12:22.142
Looks like you've got
some powerful friends.

12:22.242 --> 12:23.443
I'm just here to help.

12:23.543 --> 12:25.045
I was told you got one hour.

12:25.145 --> 12:26.814
If you don't march
those hostages out by then

12:26.914 --> 12:29.182
and not one minute later,
my directive is to get them.

12:29.282 --> 12:31.484
Tell me, why the rush?

12:31.584 --> 12:33.320
That's above my pay grade.

12:33.420 --> 12:35.789
All you need to know is
your hour starts right now.

12:35.889 --> 12:38.792
I suggest you not
waste it talking to me.

12:44.832 --> 12:45.999
Rob, what's going on?

12:46.099 --> 12:48.001
I'm gearing up to go in,

12:48.101 --> 12:50.470
but this Tac Team commander
is breathing down my neck.

12:50.570 --> 12:52.072
I need to know
who I'm dealing with.

12:52.172 --> 12:53.206
All right, no problem.

12:53.306 --> 12:54.474
We'll get all Henry
Louis Gates on him

12:54.574 --> 12:55.475
and see what
we can dig up.

12:55.575 --> 12:56.944
Thanks, guys.

12:58.478 --> 12:59.779
Grafton came through?

12:59.880 --> 13:03.116
Yeah. I just hope I can
deliver on my end.

13:03.216 --> 13:05.052
Hey. You sure you
want to go in there?

13:05.152 --> 13:06.686
You concerned about me,
Detective?

13:06.786 --> 13:08.788
Just be careful is all.

13:09.689 --> 13:11.724
Always am.

13:30.443 --> 13:31.678
Who are you?

13:32.479 --> 13:34.347
I'm the person
you called for.

13:36.749 --> 13:38.919
You helped that
woman in Bay Ridge.

13:39.019 --> 13:41.321
Her sister tried to kill
her and take her child.

13:41.421 --> 13:42.322
That's right.

13:42.422 --> 13:44.557
Evelyn Webber.

13:44.657 --> 13:45.859
I'm sorry, I...

13:45.959 --> 13:48.361
I had to make sure
it was really you.

13:49.796 --> 13:51.264
I understand.

13:51.364 --> 13:53.666
Now, how can I help you?

13:53.766 --> 13:55.802
My daughter's not well.

13:55.903 --> 13:57.804
She needs an operation.

13:57.905 --> 13:59.672
I've tried everything.
Every specialist,

13:59.772 --> 14:00.807
every treatment.

14:00.908 --> 14:02.809
I jumped through every hoop.

14:02.910 --> 14:04.077
This surgery was her only hope.

14:04.177 --> 14:06.246
But they wouldn't
give it to her, so I...

14:06.346 --> 14:08.548
I had to...

14:08.648 --> 14:09.549
I get it.

14:09.649 --> 14:11.184
Honestly, I...

14:11.284 --> 14:13.353
I don't even know what
I'd do if I were

14:13.453 --> 14:14.988
faced with this.

14:15.088 --> 14:16.890
You called me here for a reason.

14:16.990 --> 14:18.625
Now you have
to trust me.

14:18.725 --> 14:21.228
So just tell me:
where are we at?

14:21.328 --> 14:24.064
The hospital administrator,
Mr. DeSena,

14:24.164 --> 14:26.499
he said he would make
the surgery happen, but

14:26.599 --> 14:27.867
Dr. Keller is in
another operation

14:27.968 --> 14:29.602
and it could
last a while.

14:29.702 --> 14:31.171
Can't he just call in
another surgeon?

14:31.271 --> 14:33.040
No, it's a specialized procedure.

14:33.140 --> 14:34.942
Dr. Keller's the only one in
the hospital who's qualified.

14:35.042 --> 14:37.444
I don't know what to do.

14:37.544 --> 14:39.012
I need your help

14:39.112 --> 14:41.481
keeping them out until
Emily gets the help she needs.

14:41.581 --> 14:44.784
I'm sure this whole thing
will go a lot smoother

14:44.884 --> 14:46.753
if you just put the gun down.

14:46.853 --> 14:50.790
If I put this down,
the police come in here

14:50.890 --> 14:53.526
and Emily's surgery
never happens.

14:53.626 --> 14:55.395
Tell me I'm wrong.
I can't.

14:55.495 --> 14:57.064
But listen...

14:57.164 --> 14:59.032
if we get
Emily's surgery,

14:59.132 --> 15:02.069
promise me you will
put that gun down then.

15:02.169 --> 15:03.236
I promise.

15:03.336 --> 15:05.939
Thank you, Lauren.

15:06.039 --> 15:08.475
Now, you wait here...

15:08.575 --> 15:10.978
I'll be right back.

15:12.745 --> 15:16.016
Mr. DeSena,
I'm Maggie Robinson.

15:16.116 --> 15:18.986
Are you a cop?
No, but I'm
here to help.

15:19.086 --> 15:22.355
Lauren said that Dr. Keller
was in surgery.

15:22.455 --> 15:23.690
What's his ETA?

15:23.790 --> 15:26.526
Dr. Keller isn't in surgery.
He's not coming.

15:26.626 --> 15:29.229
What are you talking about?
I had to stall her.

15:29.329 --> 15:32.399
The hospital will never allow
Emily's operation to happen.

15:32.499 --> 15:34.567
I-I didn't want to
risk upsetting her.

15:34.667 --> 15:36.703
Well, lying was
not the smart move.

15:36.803 --> 15:40.707
Call Dr. Keller
and get him down here now.

15:40.807 --> 15:42.275
I'll handle the rest.

15:43.943 --> 15:45.612
Come on, tell him to
wrap that surgery up.

15:45.712 --> 15:47.480
Y-Yes.

15:47.580 --> 15:49.282
It's DeSena. Phone.

15:49.382 --> 15:51.918
I need you to find
Dr. Keller immediately.

15:52.019 --> 15:53.153
Rob, we got intel
on your guy.

15:53.253 --> 15:56.356
Great. I made
it inside but

15:56.456 --> 15:58.325
Emily's in bad shape.
She needs help soon.

15:58.425 --> 16:00.860
Yeah, well, don't expect any
from Commander Gregory.

16:00.960 --> 16:02.662
Why? What'd you find out?

16:02.762 --> 16:03.997
Former military,
father of three.

16:04.097 --> 16:06.466
Head of his local chapter
of Autism Awareness.

16:06.566 --> 16:08.701
It looks like one of his
kids was diagnosed

16:08.801 --> 16:11.038
with non-verbal
autism as a toddler.

16:11.138 --> 16:13.606
Guessing it put a strain on his
marriage because he and his wife

16:13.706 --> 16:14.841
divorced soon after that.

16:14.941 --> 16:16.176
Joined the NYPD five years ago.

16:16.276 --> 16:17.644
He's got a spotless record.

16:17.744 --> 16:19.146
He's got a reputation
for doing things

16:19.246 --> 16:20.813
by the book.
Not a "color outside the lines"

16:20.913 --> 16:22.182
type of guy.

16:22.282 --> 16:23.816
Why is he breaking protocol?

16:23.916 --> 16:25.552
Beats me. It's definitely
out of character, though.

16:25.652 --> 16:26.819
Thanks.

16:26.919 --> 16:29.756
I'll keep you guys posted.

16:31.058 --> 16:33.760
Hi, your waiter said
there was a problem?

16:34.794 --> 16:36.429
Ms. Marsette?

16:36.529 --> 16:41.901
Oh, my God.
Nelson Brown...

16:42.001 --> 16:44.671
Look at you, all grown up.

16:44.771 --> 16:46.173
Yes, ma'am.

16:46.273 --> 16:47.507
Oh, sweetheart,

16:47.607 --> 16:49.776
I was very sorry to
hear about your mama.

16:49.876 --> 16:51.278
I didn't even realize

16:51.378 --> 16:52.479
that she was sick.

16:52.579 --> 16:54.647
It happened really fast.

16:54.747 --> 16:56.383
She was a very special woman.

16:56.483 --> 16:58.651
She really was.

16:58.751 --> 17:00.019
Oh, I'm sorry, this is my niece.

17:00.120 --> 17:02.021
I brought her in to
taste your mama's gumbo.

17:02.122 --> 17:04.124
But let's say that I was

17:04.224 --> 17:07.794
very surprised to see that
the place has gone vegan.

17:07.894 --> 17:09.596
It's a big change, but...

17:09.696 --> 17:10.930
I had to update the menu.

17:11.030 --> 17:12.399
Got to keep up with
the new clientele.

17:12.499 --> 17:14.667
The neighborhood
hasn't changed that much.

17:14.767 --> 17:19.306
Truth is, Mom was never one
for writing things down.

17:19.406 --> 17:21.007
When she got sick,
we weren't focused

17:21.108 --> 17:22.909
on getting her
recipes, so...

17:23.009 --> 17:24.711
When I couldn't make
the dishes like she did...

17:24.811 --> 17:26.246
People stopped
coming in.

17:26.346 --> 17:29.149
Your family's owned this place
for generations.

17:29.249 --> 17:32.352
I'm trying to keep it alive,
Ms. Marsette.

17:32.452 --> 17:33.253
But it's...

17:33.353 --> 17:34.554
it's just not the same.

17:34.654 --> 17:36.989
I'm sure you're
really doing your best.

17:37.090 --> 17:39.392
That's really kind
of you to say.

17:39.492 --> 17:42.695
But I feel like I let down
our whole community.

17:42.795 --> 17:45.165
You know, I have probably

17:45.265 --> 17:48.201
eaten more of your mama's gumbo
than anyone.

17:48.301 --> 17:51.438
Maybe I can try
to reconstruct it.

17:53.506 --> 17:54.741
What, right now?

17:54.841 --> 17:56.343
Why not now?

17:57.610 --> 17:58.711
I'm game if you are.

17:58.811 --> 18:00.547
We're making gumbo. Okay.

18:00.647 --> 18:02.048
Let's get you an apron.

18:04.551 --> 18:05.918
<i>Hey, Dante. It's me.</i>

18:06.018 --> 18:07.187
Everything's under control.

18:07.287 --> 18:08.755
So you got the gun
away from her?

18:08.855 --> 18:10.157
No.
Can you disarm her

18:10.257 --> 18:11.524
without anyone getting hurt?

18:11.624 --> 18:12.525
Of course.

18:12.625 --> 18:13.560
But if I do that,

18:13.660 --> 18:15.027
Emily doesn't get her operation.

18:15.128 --> 18:16.396
Okay, so what's the plan?

18:16.496 --> 18:18.798
Convincing her doctor
to do the surgery.

18:18.898 --> 18:20.667
Then she'll let everyone go?

18:20.767 --> 18:21.768
Yeah, I'm positive.

18:21.868 --> 18:23.170
She doesn't want
to hurt anybody.

18:23.270 --> 18:25.305
I got to get back in there.

18:25.405 --> 18:26.973
I'm freezing in here.

18:27.073 --> 18:28.941
Can't anyone turn
down the A/C?

18:29.041 --> 18:30.443
It's like an arctic
blast in here.

18:30.543 --> 18:32.812
We have to keep
the temperature at 68

18:32.912 --> 18:34.080
to fight bacteria. Ugh.

18:34.181 --> 18:35.548
There are different
standards down here

18:35.648 --> 18:36.716
than on the admin floor.

18:36.816 --> 18:38.117
I don't like your tone.

18:38.218 --> 18:40.520
I don't like your
entitled attitude.
Yeah?

18:40.620 --> 18:41.521
Yeah.
Well...

18:41.621 --> 18:42.522
Hey. You two settle down.

18:42.622 --> 18:44.391
I know we're all tense,

18:44.491 --> 18:45.958
but arguing isn't gonna
help anything.

18:46.058 --> 18:48.461
You chastise us

18:48.561 --> 18:49.962
but you're so kind
and sympathetic

18:50.062 --> 18:51.398
to the woman brandishing a gun?

18:51.498 --> 18:53.300
Whose side are
you on anyway?

18:53.400 --> 18:56.236
I'm on the side of everyone
going home, alive.

18:56.336 --> 18:57.670
You got a problem with that?

18:58.471 --> 19:00.640
She's right. We
need to stay calm.

19:00.740 --> 19:02.509
Let me ask you something.

19:02.609 --> 19:05.712
What if every person who
can't afford a surgery

19:05.812 --> 19:07.847
shows up at a hospital
with a weapon?

19:07.947 --> 19:10.217
What kind of message
does it send

19:10.317 --> 19:11.951
if taking hostages produces

19:12.051 --> 19:13.820
exactly the result
she hoped for?

19:13.920 --> 19:15.322
She's not wrong.

19:15.422 --> 19:17.089
What a surprise, you're
advocating against the patient.

19:17.190 --> 19:18.425
What is your
problem with me?

19:18.525 --> 19:19.959
If you would've helped
Emily get the surgery

19:20.059 --> 19:21.127
in the first place,
none of us would be here.

19:21.228 --> 19:22.395
That wasn't my call.

19:22.495 --> 19:24.163
You have no idea
how these things work.

19:24.264 --> 19:26.299
And if Bill hadn't been
flirting at your station...

19:26.399 --> 19:27.534
Hey, screw you, DeSena.

19:27.634 --> 19:29.068
That's right...
Shut up, everybody,

19:29.168 --> 19:30.337
just shut up!

19:30.437 --> 19:31.838
If one of you
utters another...

19:31.938 --> 19:33.039
Lauren...

19:33.139 --> 19:34.941
This isn't helping. Please...

19:36.309 --> 19:38.378
It's Emily.
Help her.

19:38.478 --> 19:40.280
Please, don't let her die, please.

19:53.326 --> 19:54.627
The muscles in her throat
are constricting.

19:54.727 --> 19:56.296
Well, the mask isn't working.

19:56.396 --> 19:57.764
Her levels are still dropping.

19:57.864 --> 19:59.532
There's not enough oxygen
getting to her brain.

19:59.632 --> 20:01.701
Any other options?
You can't just do nothing.

20:01.801 --> 20:03.303
Her throat is too
swollen to intubate.

20:03.403 --> 20:04.771
We need to cut open an airway.

20:04.871 --> 20:07.006
Okay.

20:07.106 --> 20:08.841
Hang in there.

20:09.842 --> 20:11.811
I can't believe
this is happening.

20:11.911 --> 20:14.647
Please protect my baby girl.

20:17.016 --> 20:18.351
What are you
waiting for?

20:18.451 --> 20:20.887
What if her mom gets
so upset that she...

20:20.987 --> 20:22.955
I'll do it.

20:23.790 --> 20:26.158
I've done procedures
like this in combat.

20:26.259 --> 20:28.761
Just walk me through it.
You need
to make a half-inch

20:28.861 --> 20:30.430
incision across
her cricothyroid membrane.

20:30.530 --> 20:33.333
Okay, slow down. How do I find
the cricothyroid membrane?

20:33.433 --> 20:35.668
You tilt her head back

20:35.768 --> 20:38.505
and then you look for the-the
space just below the-the

20:38.605 --> 20:39.639
the protrusion
on her neck.

20:39.739 --> 20:41.040
Here?
Yes.

20:41.140 --> 20:43.042
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

20:43.142 --> 20:45.278
Put your body weight on her. Okay.

20:45.378 --> 20:47.079
Here we go.

20:48.147 --> 20:49.482
Please, no.

20:49.582 --> 20:51.351
Hand me the tube.

20:52.885 --> 20:54.454
Please, no. No.

20:54.554 --> 20:55.588
It's in.

20:58.691 --> 21:00.026
Thank you.

21:01.193 --> 21:02.395
I almost lost her.

21:03.129 --> 21:05.164
How could I have
failed her like this?

21:05.264 --> 21:06.866
You can't blame yourself.

21:06.966 --> 21:08.368
You just have to stay strong.

21:12.505 --> 21:14.140
It's Dr. Keller.

21:20.713 --> 21:23.149
It is a shame it took
all this to get him here.

21:23.249 --> 21:26.018
It doesn't matter.
He's here now.

21:26.118 --> 21:27.787
Go let him in.

21:33.560 --> 21:34.494
Dr. Robinson.

21:34.594 --> 21:36.028
For you.

21:38.398 --> 21:39.366
Commander Gregory here.

21:39.466 --> 21:40.667
Good news.

21:40.767 --> 21:42.402
Emily's doctor is
prepping for surgery.

21:42.502 --> 21:44.937
Hostages will walk out
as soon as it's underway.

21:45.037 --> 21:47.239
If those hostages aren't
out here in 15 minutes,

21:47.340 --> 21:48.608
my team is coming in.

21:48.708 --> 21:51.043
Commander, we're so close
to resolving this.

21:51.143 --> 21:53.546
You have children, don't you?
Can you help me out?

21:53.646 --> 21:55.247
Look, going in
isn't my call.

21:55.348 --> 21:57.450
I was told to give you
exactly one hour.

21:57.550 --> 21:59.118
I understand that, but...

21:59.218 --> 22:01.454
Those are my orders.

22:01.554 --> 22:03.923
Sorry.

22:11.698 --> 22:13.032
What's up, Rob?

22:13.132 --> 22:16.235
Harry, I need you to look
into something for me.

22:17.770 --> 22:19.105
I didn't realize

22:19.205 --> 22:21.674
anyone cared about this
gumbo as much as my mom.

22:21.774 --> 22:23.109
Well, this is
a very special dish.

22:23.209 --> 22:27.013
It's not just about how it
tastes, but what it means.

22:28.415 --> 22:30.282
Filé powder.

22:33.019 --> 22:36.222
Okay, Ms. Audrey,
where is your filé powder?

22:40.059 --> 22:41.628
Mmm.

22:41.728 --> 22:43.896
That's because every one

22:43.996 --> 22:47.166
of these ingredients
is significant.

22:48.134 --> 22:49.335
Significant how?

22:49.436 --> 22:51.438
Well, take the
cayenne pepper,

22:51.538 --> 22:53.239
came over with us from

22:53.339 --> 22:54.707
French Guinea.

22:54.807 --> 22:58.711
Everybody's gumbo is gonna be
just a little bit different,

22:58.811 --> 23:00.480
depending on
what ingredients

23:00.580 --> 23:01.781
they have access to.

23:01.881 --> 23:04.517
This one right here,
this is a creole gumbo.

23:04.617 --> 23:07.119
Oh, it's because
it has seafood in it. Exactly.

23:07.954 --> 23:09.589
You know,
they say that

23:09.689 --> 23:11.591
this country's a melting pot.

23:11.691 --> 23:14.961
Well, that is
exactly what gumbo is.

23:15.061 --> 23:17.630
Wow, that is really cool, Auntie.

23:17.730 --> 23:20.567
None of that's gonna
mean anything...

23:20.667 --> 23:22.802
unless it tastes good.

23:25.638 --> 23:26.773
Mmm.

23:26.873 --> 23:28.608
It's not perfect,

23:28.708 --> 23:31.511
but it's pretty darn close.

23:34.614 --> 23:36.182
Mmm!

23:36.282 --> 23:38.050
I never thought I'd
taste that again.

23:38.150 --> 23:40.352
Thank you,
Ms. Marsette.

23:41.821 --> 23:43.222
I should check on that.

23:43.322 --> 23:44.857
Don't worry about it,
I'll clean it up.

23:44.957 --> 23:46.759
Hey, guys.
Is everyone okay out here?

23:46.859 --> 23:47.760
We're good, Nelson.
Thank you.

23:47.860 --> 23:49.496
Auntie,

23:49.596 --> 23:51.163
can I ask you a question?

23:51.263 --> 23:52.732
Always, my love.

23:53.566 --> 23:54.801
I mean, this place,

23:54.901 --> 23:57.470
it clearly means
a lot to you.

23:57.570 --> 23:59.706
Why'd you stop coming here?

24:01.173 --> 24:03.375
This was your grandfather's
favorite spot.

24:03.476 --> 24:06.245
After he died...

24:06.345 --> 24:09.882
the thought of stepping foot
in here was just...

24:09.982 --> 24:12.051
it was too painful.

24:13.920 --> 24:16.155
I'm sorry. I...

24:16.255 --> 24:17.356
I had no idea.

24:17.456 --> 24:19.992
It's all right, baby.

24:20.960 --> 24:22.995
Feels good to be back...

24:23.996 --> 24:26.866
...remembering him.

24:30.570 --> 24:31.771
<i>Hey, Rob.</i>

24:31.871 --> 24:33.272
We looked into
the patients who were

24:33.372 --> 24:34.874
checked into D Ward
this morning like you asked.

24:34.974 --> 24:37.076
Anyone with a connection
to Commander Gregory?

24:37.176 --> 24:38.678
Not that we could find.

24:38.778 --> 24:40.112
But, uh, we did find
a person of interest.

24:40.212 --> 24:41.748
I just texted
you a pic.

24:41.848 --> 24:45.284
Is-is this guy
one of your hostages?

24:45.384 --> 24:46.686
Yeah, who is he?

24:46.786 --> 24:47.887
His name's
Andrew Beal.

24:47.987 --> 24:49.055
He was scheduled for a routine

24:49.155 --> 24:50.523
physical this morning.

24:50.623 --> 24:52.525
He's also the son
of Miranda Beal.

24:52.625 --> 24:54.260
As in Senator
Miranda Beal?

24:54.360 --> 24:55.662
Yeah, that could explain
why Commander Gregory

24:55.762 --> 24:56.929
is so gung ho to get in there.

24:57.029 --> 24:58.765
Yeah, a U.S. senator
makes a few calls

24:58.865 --> 25:00.032
to a chief of police.

25:00.132 --> 25:01.968
That'd light a fire
under anyone.

25:02.068 --> 25:05.538
I think I might know
a way out of this.

25:08.975 --> 25:11.077
Senator Miranda Beal.

25:11.177 --> 25:12.945
Her son Andrew
is one of the hostages.

25:13.713 --> 25:15.181
Holy...

25:15.281 --> 25:15.982
Well...

25:16.082 --> 25:17.383
that makes sense.

25:17.483 --> 25:19.719
Well, Emily's surgery
is almost underway.

25:19.819 --> 25:21.487
We just need a little
more time and...

25:21.588 --> 25:23.923
we can save her
and no one gets hurt.

25:24.023 --> 25:25.457
I doubt I can get you
an extension,

25:25.558 --> 25:27.326
especially now that we know
Beal's kid is inside.

25:27.426 --> 25:30.029
What if I walk him out,
deliver him safely?

25:30.129 --> 25:31.598
Then do you think
you could get Senator Beal

25:31.698 --> 25:32.732
to call off the dogs?

25:32.832 --> 25:33.766
Yeah.

25:33.866 --> 25:34.767
I think I can sell that.

25:34.867 --> 25:35.768
Okay.

25:40.573 --> 25:41.974
She's never gonna let us go.

25:42.074 --> 25:44.043
She just wants to
help her daughter.
Really?

25:44.143 --> 25:46.579
Then why didn't she let us go
when the doctor showed up?

25:46.679 --> 25:48.948
She's probably waiting
for the surgery to start.

25:49.048 --> 25:52.018
And what happens if
the surgery doesn't go well?

25:52.118 --> 25:54.420
You really want to see
her reaction to that?

25:55.454 --> 25:58.024
It's time to get her to the OR.

26:09.101 --> 26:10.970
Hey, what are you doing?

26:13.005 --> 26:15.274
Hey! Gun!

26:16.075 --> 26:17.243
Oh!

26:19.311 --> 26:20.747
You okay?
I'm okay.

26:20.847 --> 26:23.249
Dr. Keller!

26:23.349 --> 26:24.516
He's been shot.

26:39.231 --> 26:41.600
What are we gonna do now?
I can't lose my daughter.

26:41.701 --> 26:43.836
It's not over.
Yes, it is.

26:43.936 --> 26:45.471
No one else in the hospital

26:45.571 --> 26:47.339
is qualified to perform
her surgery.

26:47.439 --> 26:49.475
So we'll find
a different surgeon.

26:49.575 --> 26:51.010
No one is giving up.

26:54.914 --> 26:56.015
Hey. Dante.

26:56.115 --> 26:57.684
What happened?
We heard a gunshot.

26:57.784 --> 26:59.118
It wasn't Lauren.

26:59.218 --> 27:00.552
One of the hostages
had a gun in her purse.

27:00.653 --> 27:02.321
Anyone hit?

27:02.421 --> 27:03.823
Unfortunately, Dr. Keller.

27:03.923 --> 27:05.157
You mean the only doctor
in the building

27:05.257 --> 27:06.292
who could perform the surgery?

27:06.392 --> 27:07.760
He'll live.

27:07.860 --> 27:09.696
But I'm going to need
more time to find

27:09.796 --> 27:12.131
another surgeon.

27:16.703 --> 27:18.304
Dr. Robinson says the gun
wasn't fired by Lauren.

27:18.404 --> 27:20.006
If Lauren didn't
fire it, who did?

27:20.106 --> 27:21.240
One of the hostages.

27:21.340 --> 27:22.241
Wait, the hostage is armed, too?

27:22.341 --> 27:23.242
This is a major problem.

27:23.342 --> 27:24.877
Which has been fixed.

27:24.977 --> 27:26.278
The armed hostage
was subdued.

27:26.378 --> 27:28.080
The surgeon was wounded,
he'll be fine,

27:28.180 --> 27:30.416
but they need more time
to locate another surgeon.
Absolutely not.

27:30.516 --> 27:32.785
D.A. Grafton, the deal
is still on the table.

27:32.885 --> 27:36.522
Dr. Robinson can walk out
the senator's son right now.

27:36.622 --> 27:37.957
A shot has been fired, Detective.

27:38.057 --> 27:39.558
That's an escalation,
which means...

27:39.658 --> 27:40.927
It means no more deals.

27:41.027 --> 27:42.494
This has gotten
way out of control.

27:42.594 --> 27:44.130
We tried it
Dr. Robinson's way,

27:44.230 --> 27:45.832
we do this my way now.

27:45.932 --> 27:47.099
Commander, we can still
resolve this

27:47.199 --> 27:48.367
without anyone else
getting hurt,

27:48.467 --> 27:50.102
and save a little girl's life!

27:51.270 --> 27:52.739
Have a damn heart, man!

28:00.479 --> 28:03.082
Officer Murphy,
escort Detective Dante

28:03.182 --> 28:05.251
out of my perimeter.

28:05.351 --> 28:06.853
I can see myself out.

28:11.323 --> 28:13.225
Get everyone into position.

28:13.325 --> 28:14.660
Initiate Charlie Alpha.

28:14.761 --> 28:16.295
Let's move!

28:16.395 --> 28:18.030
Charlie Alpha, let's go!

28:21.167 --> 28:22.268
What does it say?

28:22.368 --> 28:24.203
We're out of time.

28:24.303 --> 28:25.604
Tac Team is coming in.

28:25.704 --> 28:26.973
The good news is,

28:27.073 --> 28:30.042
this is considered
an unstable situation.

28:30.142 --> 28:31.443
Why is that good news?

28:31.543 --> 28:33.545
Because they'll have to
use stealth maneuvers,

28:33.645 --> 28:35.114
which take more time.

28:35.214 --> 28:37.183
Which means we
still have a chance.

28:37.283 --> 28:38.885
We just have to move fast.

28:41.720 --> 28:42.721
How's it going, Rob?

28:42.822 --> 28:43.790
Not great.

28:43.890 --> 28:45.191
We have to find a new surgeon

28:45.291 --> 28:46.525
for Emily, immediately.

28:46.625 --> 28:47.860
Okay, she has polymicrogyria.

28:47.960 --> 28:49.862
Looks like there's
only a few surgeons

28:49.962 --> 28:51.397
qualified to do
the procedure.

28:51.497 --> 28:54.166
Not surprising, it's
a high-risk pediatric surgery.

28:54.266 --> 28:56.068
Okay, um, here's one.

28:56.168 --> 28:57.937
Uh, but no, he's on
the West Coast.

28:58.037 --> 28:59.939
Here's one that's done the
surgery in the tristate area

29:00.039 --> 29:02.975
but she's in the middle
of an operation right now.

29:03.075 --> 29:05.011
Well, we can't wait.
Is there someone else?

29:05.111 --> 29:06.478
It seems like
there's no one left

29:06.578 --> 29:07.880
in the Northeastern
United States.

29:07.980 --> 29:09.615
There's got to be. Look again.

29:09.715 --> 29:11.217
Okay, wait a minute, um...

29:11.317 --> 29:12.684
There's an article in
the <i>Oxford Medical Journal</i>

29:12.785 --> 29:14.386
about the surgery.

29:14.486 --> 29:17.256
It was performed in Iraq
by a Dr. Abdul Mazdaki.

29:17.356 --> 29:18.757
Iraq? Honey, we're
looking for someone

29:18.858 --> 29:20.492
closer to Manhattan,
not further away.

29:20.592 --> 29:21.527
Yeah, so is he.

29:21.627 --> 29:22.628
It looks like he left Iraq,

29:22.728 --> 29:23.662
uh, got his visa stamped

29:23.762 --> 29:25.397
at JFK two months ago.

29:25.497 --> 29:26.632
Is he still in New York?

29:26.732 --> 29:27.633
Yeah, his current address
is in Queens.

29:27.733 --> 29:28.667
Close enough?

29:28.767 --> 29:29.802
We got to find him fast.

29:29.902 --> 29:31.337
Which hospital is he working at?

29:31.437 --> 29:34.073
No, it's odd. Looks like
he's got a job as a cab driver

29:34.173 --> 29:35.607
in the city.

29:37.309 --> 29:39.011
Have a nice day.

29:39.645 --> 29:41.047
Hey, you didn't pay!

29:43.015 --> 29:45.184
I got you covered, boss.
Abdul Mazdaki?

29:45.284 --> 29:46.585
I am.

29:46.685 --> 29:48.487
You performed a hemispherectomy
on a six-year-old boy

29:48.587 --> 29:49.822
in Iraq, right?
Who are you?

29:49.922 --> 29:51.057
Listen, Doctor,
I know it's been a minute

29:51.157 --> 29:52.825
since you held a scalpel,
but there's

29:52.925 --> 29:54.526
a sick little girl right now
that could really use your help.

29:54.626 --> 29:56.762
If I was allowed to
practice medicine in the U.S.,

29:56.863 --> 29:58.397
do you think I'd be
driving a cab?

29:58.497 --> 30:01.433
I'm sorry. My credentials
aren't recognized here.

30:01.533 --> 30:04.670
Listen, this little girl
is barely hanging on, okay?

30:04.770 --> 30:06.072
You're literally
the only person

30:06.172 --> 30:07.606
that can save her life
right now.

30:07.706 --> 30:08.807
I promise you the last
thing she cares about

30:08.908 --> 30:10.042
are your credentials.

30:10.142 --> 30:12.078
She just needs you
to be a doctor again.

30:13.512 --> 30:14.613
Tell me where to go.

30:14.713 --> 30:16.748
Actually, mind if I drive?

30:17.516 --> 30:20.586
Just in time.
OR is prepped.

30:20.686 --> 30:21.720
Sorry. Nobody goes inside.

30:21.820 --> 30:24.056
Hey, this is Dr. Mazdaki.

30:24.156 --> 30:25.791
He's doing surgery
on that girl up there.

30:25.892 --> 30:28.127
So, please, get out of the way.

30:28.227 --> 30:29.395
Was I not clear?

30:29.495 --> 30:30.829
I want you outside
of my perimeter.

30:30.930 --> 30:32.631
Good idea. We'll stay here,
talk to those reporters.

30:32.731 --> 30:33.900
Bet they'd be
interested to know

30:34.000 --> 30:35.334
the Tac Team commander
just turned away

30:35.434 --> 30:37.203
the only doctor that can
save that dying girl's life,

30:37.303 --> 30:39.305
over an ego trip.

30:43.642 --> 30:45.011
Let them through.

30:50.582 --> 30:51.918
Swanson, what's your status?

30:52.018 --> 30:53.819
I'm accessing
the entry point now.

30:53.920 --> 30:55.321
As soon as you have eyes
on the target, let me know,

30:55.421 --> 30:57.156
and I'll give you
the green light

30:57.256 --> 30:58.324
to take her out.

30:58.424 --> 30:59.725
Copy that.

31:08.234 --> 31:09.568
That was fast.

31:09.668 --> 31:11.637
Yeah, well, I might've
broken a traffic law or five.

31:11.737 --> 31:14.240
He should be
the taxi driver.
Missed my calling.

31:14.340 --> 31:16.075
Thank you so much for coming.

31:16.175 --> 31:17.576
Don't thank me yet.

31:17.676 --> 31:20.012
Doctor. Nurse Miller has
already prepped the patient.

31:20.112 --> 31:21.480
She's gonna be assisting you

31:21.580 --> 31:23.249
on the procedure.
Pleasure to meet you, Nurse.

31:23.349 --> 31:25.684
I read about what you did
for that boy in Baghdad.

31:25.784 --> 31:27.819
If you don't mind, I'd like
to observe the operation?

31:27.920 --> 31:29.855
See your technique?
Of course.

31:29.956 --> 31:30.990
Let's get to work.

31:34.160 --> 31:35.227
Hey, honey. Hey.

31:35.327 --> 31:36.795
I couldn't find him. Any luck?

31:36.895 --> 31:39.631
Yeah, Doc's going into
the OR right now.

31:39.731 --> 31:41.267
Thank God.

31:41.367 --> 31:44.603
I'm heading back, I'll keep
an ear out for police activity.

31:44.703 --> 31:45.804
And babe?

31:45.904 --> 31:46.872
Good job finding him.

31:46.973 --> 31:48.207
Thanks. I got lucky.

31:48.307 --> 31:50.076
I just hope some of that
rubs off on Emily.

32:04.590 --> 32:06.292
I think the Tac Team's
made their move.

32:06.392 --> 32:07.593
What do you mean?

32:07.693 --> 32:08.894
I was talking to
one of the Tac officers

32:08.995 --> 32:11.030
I know earlier,
but now I don't see her.

32:11.130 --> 32:12.931
Dr. Mazdaki is prepping the OR.

32:13.032 --> 32:15.034
As soon as the surgery
is underway,

32:15.134 --> 32:17.036
Lauren is going to
release the hostages.

32:17.136 --> 32:18.237
It's too late.

32:19.438 --> 32:22.308
I'm gonna hide Lauren in another
ward until I can sneak her out.

32:22.408 --> 32:24.276
Disagree. Best bet is
to get the gun out

32:24.376 --> 32:26.645
of her hands
and have her surrender.

32:26.745 --> 32:28.747
I can pull this off.
Moving her is the safest option.

32:28.847 --> 32:30.182
If she becomes
a hunted fugitive,

32:30.282 --> 32:31.183
we both know how this ends.

32:31.283 --> 32:33.619
Trust me on this.

32:37.023 --> 32:38.024
Okay.

32:38.124 --> 32:39.591
We'll try your way.

32:39.691 --> 32:41.093
Do you know how they plan
on breaching the building?

32:41.193 --> 32:42.461
No idea.

32:51.070 --> 32:52.338
They turned off the A/C.

32:52.438 --> 32:53.972
They're coming in through
the air ducts.

32:54.073 --> 32:54.973
It's what I would do.

32:55.074 --> 32:56.808
I got to go.

33:00.746 --> 33:04.516
Lauren, we're out of time.

33:04.616 --> 33:06.452
You have to drop that gun

33:06.552 --> 33:07.986
and let those hostages go.

33:08.087 --> 33:09.855
Not until her surgery is over.

33:09.955 --> 33:12.624
We agreed you'd let
them go once it started.

33:12.724 --> 33:15.227
What is to stop Tac
from barging into the OR

33:15.327 --> 33:16.662
the second they come in here?

33:16.762 --> 33:19.565
They don't care about Emily
or what happens to her.

33:22.234 --> 33:23.602
Here's what I know.

33:23.702 --> 33:25.971
If you don't drop that gun
by the time the Tac Team

33:26.072 --> 33:29.908
shows up, Emily won't have
a mom when she wakes up.

33:35.747 --> 33:37.783
I need you to
listen to me, Lauren.

33:37.883 --> 33:41.053
I get it.
As a mother, I get it.

33:41.153 --> 33:42.754
Swanson, do you have the shot?

33:42.854 --> 33:43.955
Negative.

33:44.056 --> 33:45.557
Let me know as soon as you do.

33:45.657 --> 33:46.592
And I promise you,

33:46.692 --> 33:48.394
I will be right by her side

33:48.494 --> 33:49.928
as long as she's in surgery.

33:50.028 --> 33:52.064
They want to stop it, they'll
have to come through me.

33:52.164 --> 33:53.065
How about now?

33:53.165 --> 33:54.266
Still negative, sir.

33:54.366 --> 33:55.534
Swanson,
what's happening in there?

33:55.634 --> 33:57.436
The shrink is trying
to talk her down.

33:59.638 --> 34:00.906
I turned up the volume
on my comm.

34:01.006 --> 34:02.574
You should be able to
hear their voices.

34:02.674 --> 34:03.609
I have to protect

34:03.709 --> 34:06.745
my daughter. That is my job.

34:06.845 --> 34:08.414
We all think
if we try hard enough,

34:08.514 --> 34:10.749
we can steer life
the way we want it to go.

34:10.849 --> 34:13.452
That we can control what
happens to the ones we love.

34:13.552 --> 34:15.821
But that's not
always how it works.

34:15.921 --> 34:17.989
But I'll tell you
what we can control.

34:18.090 --> 34:20.559
If you surrender,

34:20.659 --> 34:25.164
I will protect Emily as long
as she is in surgery.

34:25.264 --> 34:26.865
I promise you that.

34:26.965 --> 34:29.101
Everything you've been through,
every battle you have fought

34:29.201 --> 34:31.937
through the years
has been for Emily.

34:32.037 --> 34:33.339
She needed you.

34:33.439 --> 34:36.275
Just like she's gonna
need you when she pulls

34:36.375 --> 34:37.676
through that surgery.

34:37.776 --> 34:40.246
You need to keep
being a mother.

34:40.346 --> 34:43.482
Don't fail her now.

34:44.416 --> 34:45.684
I've got the shot, sir.

34:45.784 --> 34:47.819
I saw how she looked at you.

34:47.919 --> 34:50.722
You're the center
of her world.

34:50.822 --> 34:52.691
She doesn't know what
you've given up for her.

34:52.791 --> 34:55.261
But she loves you

34:55.361 --> 34:57.196
more than anything.

34:57.829 --> 35:01.533
Don't fail her now.

35:05.404 --> 35:07.239
Sir, do I have a green light?

35:11.310 --> 35:12.811
Stand down.

35:12.911 --> 35:14.546
But, sir, I have a clear shot.

35:14.646 --> 35:17.149
I repeat: stand down.

35:17.249 --> 35:21.487
I need you to trust me now.

35:21.587 --> 35:23.389
Please...

35:23.489 --> 35:25.957
give me the gun, Lauren.

35:42.441 --> 35:43.542
Gun is down. I repeat:

35:43.642 --> 35:46.144
gun is down.

35:51.583 --> 35:53.285
Everything going okay over here?

35:53.385 --> 35:56.121
My bowl is just about
empty, isn't it?
Mmm!

35:56.222 --> 35:57.523
This is hands down

35:57.623 --> 35:59.391
the best gumbo I've ever had.

35:59.491 --> 36:00.826
Now that I have the recipe,

36:00.926 --> 36:02.428
it goes right back on the menu.

36:02.528 --> 36:04.830
You know, I remember quite
a few of your mom's dishes.

36:04.930 --> 36:07.333
Maybe I could help recreate
some of those, too.

36:07.433 --> 36:09.435
I don't mean
to intrude, but

36:09.535 --> 36:11.337
what is that? It smells amazing.

36:11.437 --> 36:12.838
Trust me, it tastes even better.

36:12.938 --> 36:14.673
It's my mother's gumbo.

36:14.773 --> 36:16.342
I'll make you some
next time you come in.

36:16.442 --> 36:18.844
In that case, see you tomorrow.

36:22.248 --> 36:23.582
It was my mother's dream

36:23.682 --> 36:25.684
for me to keep this place
going after she was gone,

36:25.784 --> 36:27.919
to keep our
traditions alive.

36:28.019 --> 36:28.920
Now I can.

36:29.020 --> 36:31.122
I don't know how to thank you.

36:31.223 --> 36:32.724
Well...

36:32.824 --> 36:34.660
let's take a look
at that dessert menu.

36:34.760 --> 36:36.662
I'm sure we can
work something out.

36:45.804 --> 36:48.774
Hey.
How is she?

36:48.874 --> 36:51.176
The surgery
was a success.

36:51.277 --> 36:53.245
Emily is doing great.

36:55.547 --> 36:57.148
How can I ever thank you?

36:57.249 --> 36:58.950
Thank Dr. Mazdaki.

36:59.050 --> 37:01.019
He's the one who
saved Emily's life.

37:01.119 --> 37:03.221
In fact, the hospital
is offering him

37:03.322 --> 37:05.056
a path to residency.

37:05.156 --> 37:06.458
He deserves it.

37:06.558 --> 37:08.860
My baby's alive.

37:08.960 --> 37:10.362
Even if I have to spend
the rest of my life

37:10.462 --> 37:11.563
in prison, it was worth it.

37:11.663 --> 37:13.565
Well, hopefully
not so long.

37:13.665 --> 37:16.302
The D.A. is seeing
what she can do.

37:16.402 --> 37:19.638
Senator Beal is not the only one
in this town with some pull.

37:19.738 --> 37:21.973
I owe you so much.

37:22.073 --> 37:24.843
No.

37:24.943 --> 37:27.913
You did what you had
to do for your daughter.

37:28.847 --> 37:30.582
I was just backing you up.

37:32.017 --> 37:34.320
One mother helping
another mother.

37:34.420 --> 37:35.854
Hang in there.

37:44.029 --> 37:46.698
Thank you for letting me
give her the news in person.

37:46.798 --> 37:48.199
You saved a few lives today.

37:48.300 --> 37:50.669
I'd say you earned the favor.
Well, I appreciate it.

37:50.769 --> 37:53.705
I appreciate
you, Marcus.

37:53.805 --> 37:55.374
I hope so.

37:55.474 --> 37:57.776
Not too many people who'd take
on a whole Tac Team for you.

37:57.876 --> 38:00.211
No, that was all you.

38:01.580 --> 38:03.515
We make a great team.

38:03.615 --> 38:05.451
We do.

38:06.452 --> 38:08.286
But if we're going
to continue to do this,

38:08.387 --> 38:10.422
it needs to be just that.

38:10.522 --> 38:12.824
Team effort.
Team decisions.

38:12.924 --> 38:15.193
You're right.

38:16.328 --> 38:18.830
I should've listened to you
when it came to Randall Grayle.

38:18.930 --> 38:20.732
I appreciate you saying that.

38:20.832 --> 38:22.834
Well, I mean it.

38:23.669 --> 38:26.905
Sometimes I push too hard, I...

38:27.005 --> 38:27.739
Well...

38:27.839 --> 38:30.776
that's over now.

38:31.677 --> 38:33.912
So, we good?

38:34.946 --> 38:37.949
Yeah. We're good.

38:49.395 --> 38:50.562
Welcome back.

38:50.662 --> 38:52.998
It's good to be home. Aww.

38:53.098 --> 38:55.000
It was a tough day. Yeah.

38:55.100 --> 38:56.935
But we did good.
We did. We did.

38:57.035 --> 39:01.239
I got to be honest though,
my mind was on you

39:01.339 --> 39:02.474
the entire time.

39:02.574 --> 39:04.209
Something about seeing
that-that little girl,

39:04.309 --> 39:06.745
at the end and that mom
in so much anguish,

39:06.845 --> 39:09.147
it just made me
really appreciate...

39:09.247 --> 39:13.719
how much I love you and
how I would do anything for you.

39:14.920 --> 39:17.523
We're very lucky. Yeah.

39:23.795 --> 39:26.331
Hey. Y'all
waited for me?

39:26.432 --> 39:27.566
Of course we did.

39:27.666 --> 39:28.667
Is that...

39:28.767 --> 39:31.036
Miss Audrey's gumbo?

39:31.136 --> 39:32.203
Sure is.

39:32.303 --> 39:34.773
Oh, we used to go there so much.
Mm-hmm.

39:34.873 --> 39:35.941
Daddy loved it there.

39:36.041 --> 39:38.577
He's not the only one.

39:38.677 --> 39:40.512
You know, we should
go there more often,

39:40.612 --> 39:41.647
to the old neighborhood.

39:41.747 --> 39:42.881
Not just for the gumbo.

39:42.981 --> 39:44.683
To stay connected.

39:44.783 --> 39:46.351
Can we?

39:46.452 --> 39:48.420
I really enjoyed learning
more about Grandpa.

39:48.520 --> 39:49.988
And where we come from.

39:50.822 --> 39:52.090
It's important.

39:52.190 --> 39:54.660
Some of those memories
are painful, but...

39:54.760 --> 39:57.796
there are also some
really good ones.

39:57.896 --> 39:59.731
Shall we give thanks?

40:02.333 --> 40:04.903
Not just for the food
that's on this table,

40:05.003 --> 40:07.673
but for the ancestors that
have brought us thus far.

40:07.773 --> 40:11.176
For community
that sustains us.

40:11.276 --> 40:13.912
And most of all,
for this family.

40:15.581 --> 40:16.815
Amen.
Amen.

40:16.915 --> 40:18.216
Now, let me get
at some of that gumbo.

40:18.316 --> 40:19.384
Ooh!

40:22.020 --> 40:23.188
Who could that be at this hour?

40:23.288 --> 40:25.423
I'll get that.

40:28.193 --> 40:29.895
I could eat like this every day.

40:29.995 --> 40:31.697
Don't you know it, girl?

40:31.797 --> 40:33.732
You know I can.

40:33.832 --> 40:34.966
Are you Robyn McCall?
Thank you.

40:35.066 --> 40:37.302
Yes.
Mm-hmm.

40:40.772 --> 40:41.840
Hey, Mom,

40:41.940 --> 40:43.208
is everything okay?

40:45.410 --> 40:46.778
No.

40:47.579 --> 40:48.880
I just got served.

40:50.081 --> 40:52.317
Your father wants
sole custody of you.
