00:29.729 --> 00:32.095
Computer,
deactivate Mess Hall lights.

00:35.368 --> 00:36.892
Oh!

00:36.970 --> 00:38.164
You scared me.

00:38.238 --> 00:39.603
That wasn't my intention.

00:39.672 --> 00:40.969
No, of course not.

00:41.041 --> 00:43.475
l- l- l guess l'm- l'm just
a little jumpy- -

00:43.543 --> 00:45.773
especially after
what happened the last time.

00:45.845 --> 00:47.472
- That's why l'm here.
- Oh?

00:47.547 --> 00:49.276
We'll be shutting
down main power soon.

00:49.349 --> 00:51.840
The children's regeneration
cycle will be interrupted.

00:51.918 --> 00:53.146
They'll require supervision.

00:53.219 --> 00:54.982
Well, l'm happy to help.

00:55.055 --> 00:56.579
To tell you the truth,

00:56.656 --> 00:58.647
l'd be grateful
for the distraction.

00:58.725 --> 01:01.285
The procedure could
take several hours.

01:01.361 --> 01:04.797
How much do they know
about what's happening?

01:04.864 --> 01:06.855
Nothing.

01:06.933 --> 01:09.197
The children have
overactive imaginations.

01:09.269 --> 01:11.533
l don't want to alarm
them unnecessarily.

01:11.604 --> 01:13.834
What if they
start asking questions?

01:13.907 --> 01:15.374
l can't just lie to them.

01:15.442 --> 01:17.933
You have considerable
child- care experience.

01:18.078 --> 01:19.545
l'm sure you'll manage.

01:26.586 --> 01:28.076
That's close enough.

01:28.154 --> 01:30.213
Let our momentum carry us in.

01:30.290 --> 01:31.985
Cutting engines.

01:34.027 --> 01:36.257
Now, there's a creepy image.

01:36.329 --> 01:39.059
Reminds me of something
out of Edgar Allan Poe.

01:39.132 --> 01:40.656
Looks like a vampire bat.

01:40.733 --> 01:43.896
You can make out the wings,
even the ears.

01:43.970 --> 01:45.335
What do you see, Tuvok?

01:45.405 --> 01:48.465
Two Starfleet officers
with juvenile imaginations.

01:48.541 --> 01:49.769
Come on, Tuvok.

01:49.843 --> 01:52.505
Haven't you ever looked
up at the clouds

01:52.579 --> 01:53.910
and seen an animal?

01:53.980 --> 01:56.141
l will never understand
the human need

01:56.216 --> 01:58.616
to find imagery
in something as innocuous

01:58.685 --> 02:00.175
as a cloud.

02:00.253 --> 02:01.618
Harry, are we ready?

02:01.688 --> 02:03.417
Yes, ma'am.

02:03.490 --> 02:04.718
Then let's do it.

02:04.791 --> 02:08.386
All hands... initiate
shutdown sequence.

02:25.879 --> 02:28.404
Computer, deactivate EMH.

02:50.203 --> 02:51.727
Everything's all right.

02:51.804 --> 02:53.169
We've just had to shut down

02:53.239 --> 02:54.467
main power temporarily.

02:54.541 --> 02:57.567
Nothing to be concerned about.

02:59.546 --> 03:02.447
Three, two, one- -

03:02.515 --> 03:03.914
mark.

03:10.890 --> 03:13.256
All decks report shutdown
complete, Captain.

03:13.326 --> 03:15.294
Janeway to Seven of Nine.

03:15.361 --> 03:16.760
We're ready.

03:16.829 --> 03:18.296
Acknowledged.

05:15.515 --> 05:17.847
Why did they shut down
main power?

05:17.917 --> 05:19.748
lt's simply a precaution.

05:19.819 --> 05:22.014
We've entered a class- J nebula,

05:22.088 --> 05:24.556
and the Captain wants
to make sure

05:24.624 --> 05:28.685
that we don't attract any, uh,
residual EM radiation.

05:28.761 --> 05:30.922
Our shields provide
sufficient protection

05:31.030 --> 05:32.463
against nebula discharge.

05:32.532 --> 05:33.760
ls that so?

05:33.833 --> 05:35.926
Well, l'm afraid
that gaseous anomalies

05:36.069 --> 05:37.661
were never really my specialty.

05:37.737 --> 05:38.931
Come on, gather 'round.

05:39.038 --> 05:39.936
l brought toys

05:40.039 --> 05:42.599
and stories and games,

05:42.675 --> 05:43.937
and l thought that later

05:44.077 --> 05:46.204
we might even have
a little sing- along.

05:46.279 --> 05:47.803
l should go
to Astrometrics.

05:47.880 --> 05:50.474
Seven may need my help.

05:50.550 --> 05:53.178
l'm afraid that Astrometrics
is shut down, too.

05:53.252 --> 05:55.117
lf we're not
analyzing the nebula,

05:55.188 --> 05:57.213
why did we enter it?

05:57.290 --> 05:59.690
Oh, that is
a long and dull story

05:59.759 --> 06:03.195
and not nearly as interesting
as ''Flotter Meets

06:03.262 --> 06:04.661
the lnvincible lnvertebrates.''

06:04.731 --> 06:06.460
ls Voyager in danger?

06:06.532 --> 06:08.557
Mezoti, there's really no need

06:08.634 --> 06:11.125
to leap
to those kinds of conclusions.

06:11.204 --> 06:13.798
Maybe if you explained
what's happening in more detail,

06:13.873 --> 06:15.101
we wouldn't have to guess.

06:15.174 --> 06:17.540
This has something to do
with Deck 12, doesn't it?

06:17.610 --> 06:19.805
Well, what makes you say that?

06:19.879 --> 06:21.744
Deck 12, Section 42
is off limits

06:21.814 --> 06:23.611
to everyone but senior officers

06:23.683 --> 06:25.742
with a level- 6
security clearance.

06:25.818 --> 06:28.048
That's because it's
haunted, isn't it?

06:28.121 --> 06:29.884
Who told you that?

06:29.956 --> 06:31.184
Naomi.

06:31.257 --> 06:33.191
She was just trying
to frighten you.

06:33.259 --> 06:36.592
l'll have to have
a talk with that girl.

06:36.662 --> 06:37.754
ls it true?

06:37.830 --> 06:39.195
Does a ghost live there?

06:39.265 --> 06:43.361
You're really too old
to believe in such silly things.

06:43.436 --> 06:45.529
lf it's not a ghost, what is it?

06:45.605 --> 06:47.334
We deserve an explanation.

06:47.407 --> 06:50.433
l don't think that Seven
would be too happy

06:50.510 --> 06:53.707
if you all started waking up
with nightmares.

06:53.780 --> 06:55.543
- Tell us.
- Please?

06:56.616 --> 06:57.947
All right.

06:58.084 --> 06:59.415
Gather 'round.

07:01.087 --> 07:03.021
But l'm warning you- -

07:03.089 --> 07:07.890
this is not a tale
for the faint of heart.

07:07.994 --> 07:09.325
We're not faint of heart.

07:09.395 --> 07:11.761
Our cardiopulmonary
systems are reinforced.

07:11.831 --> 07:14.527
So don't leave anything out.

07:14.600 --> 07:17.899
All right, but remember,
l warned you.

07:20.773 --> 07:24.265
lt all began several months ago,
before you joined Voyager.

07:24.343 --> 07:28.905
We were exploring
a dark nebula,

07:29.048 --> 07:30.709
just gathering deuterium.

07:30.783 --> 07:33.616
We had no idea
what was in store for us,

07:33.686 --> 07:36.120
but when the turbulence started
getting rough,

07:36.189 --> 07:38.180
we should have seen that
as an omen.

07:38.257 --> 07:41.192
How goes the particle
collecting, Commander?

07:41.260 --> 07:43.194
We've gotten enough deuterium

07:43.262 --> 07:44.354
to power the warp engines

07:44.430 --> 07:45.897
for another thousand
light- years.

07:45.965 --> 07:47.523
Excellent.

07:47.600 --> 07:49.625
Something wrong?

07:49.702 --> 07:51.533
Uh, now that you mention it,
there is something

07:51.604 --> 07:53.299
that l feel compelled
to share with you

07:53.372 --> 07:55.670
in my capacity
as Morale Officer.

07:55.741 --> 07:59.575
The crew seem a little on edge.

07:59.645 --> 08:01.442
Oh?

08:01.514 --> 08:04.244
They don't appear
particularly anxious

08:04.317 --> 08:05.716
to me.

08:05.785 --> 08:08.549
Well, they're very good
at hiding their fears.

08:08.621 --> 08:10.612
Starfleet training.

08:10.690 --> 08:12.123
Um, l was wondering

08:12.191 --> 08:15.319
how soon we might
be leaving this nebula.

08:15.394 --> 08:17.885
Knowing could help
reassure them.

08:17.997 --> 08:20.795
Well, it's difficult to say.

08:20.867 --> 08:23.700
The Bussard collectors
are running at maximum,

08:23.769 --> 08:25.361
but it's a slow process.

08:25.438 --> 08:27.201
We could be here for
several more days.

08:28.608 --> 08:29.870
Days.

08:31.944 --> 08:35.505
Mr. Neelix, are you certain
it's not you who is on edge?

08:37.482 --> 08:40.509
You know me too well,
Mr. Vulcan.

08:40.586 --> 08:44.647
l can assure you, a J- class
nebula is no cause for alarm.

08:44.724 --> 08:46.214
l know it's illogical,

08:46.292 --> 08:48.658
but staring
into this murky cloud

08:48.728 --> 08:51.959
for hours on end
can be a little unsettling.

08:54.100 --> 08:56.796
When l was a child,

08:56.869 --> 09:00.134
an immense plasma drift passed
through the Talaxian system.

09:00.206 --> 09:03.141
The stars and the moons
were blotted out for months.

09:03.209 --> 09:05.370
From horizon to horizon,
all you could see

09:05.444 --> 09:07.639
was this... this enormous,
menacing cloud.

09:07.713 --> 09:11.342
Ever since then, l've
found it a little disturbing

09:11.417 --> 09:12.714
to be in nebulas.

09:13.786 --> 09:15.879
Perhaps the Captain
might give you permission

09:15.988 --> 09:17.478
to install curtains.

09:17.557 --> 09:19.889
That's an excellent idea,

09:19.992 --> 09:22.392
and l have just
the right material.

09:23.596 --> 09:24.893
Report.

09:24.997 --> 09:26.760
The nebula's beginning
to destabilize.

09:26.832 --> 09:28.299
Cause.

09:28.367 --> 09:30.392
l'm not sure.
lt could have something to do

09:30.469 --> 09:32.403
with the nadion emissions
being produced

09:32.471 --> 09:33.733
by the Bussard collectors.

09:33.806 --> 09:34.830
You're not remembering

09:34.907 --> 09:36.272
correctly.

09:36.342 --> 09:37.707
l beg your pardon?

09:37.777 --> 09:39.074
The Bussard collectors

09:39.145 --> 09:41.010
don't produce nadion emissions.

09:41.080 --> 09:43.514
Well, the technical details
don't matter.

09:43.583 --> 09:45.608
What's important is
that Voyager's presence

09:45.685 --> 09:47.118
was destabilizing the nebula,

09:47.186 --> 09:50.713
and the crew wasn't interested
in taking any chances.

09:50.790 --> 09:52.485
We've got 80 percent
of the deuterium we wanted.

09:52.558 --> 09:53.923
Maybe we shouldn't
push our luck.

09:54.026 --> 09:55.425
Agreed. Bridge to Engineering.

09:55.494 --> 09:56.586
Go ahead.

09:56.662 --> 09:57.924
We're suspending
the dilithium intake.

09:57.997 --> 09:58.929
Acknowledged.

09:58.998 --> 10:00.056
Tom, take us out.

10:00.132 --> 10:01.292
Aye.

10:01.367 --> 10:02.800
But at that exact moment,

10:02.868 --> 10:04.699
in the fraction of a second
before Tom

10:04.770 --> 10:06.761
could engage the engines, zap!

10:06.839 --> 10:10.605
We were hit.

10:10.676 --> 10:11.734
What was it?

10:11.811 --> 10:12.743
The ghost?

10:12.812 --> 10:14.643
Shh. Let him finish.

10:14.714 --> 10:18.150
Whatever it was,
it shook the ship hard.

10:19.218 --> 10:20.617
An EM discharge

10:20.686 --> 10:21.812
penetrated the hull- -

10:21.887 --> 10:23.548
Deck 7, Section 10.

10:23.623 --> 10:24.885
lncreasing power

10:24.957 --> 10:25.981
to structural integrity.

10:27.360 --> 10:30.124
We're clear.

10:30.196 --> 10:31.754
Damage.

10:31.831 --> 10:33.128
Power outages on three decks.

10:33.199 --> 10:35.463
Auxiliary subprocessors
are off- line.

10:35.534 --> 10:36.694
No injuries reported.

10:36.769 --> 10:37.827
Assign repair teams.

10:37.903 --> 10:39.097
Resume course.

10:39.171 --> 10:41.196
We'd taken some minor damage,

10:41.273 --> 10:45.835
but for the most part,
everything was fine...

10:45.911 --> 10:48.675
or so we thought.

10:48.748 --> 10:50.215
What none of us knew

10:50.282 --> 10:54.241
was that a mysterious stowaway
had come aboard Voyager.

11:01.093 --> 11:03.391
What kind of stowaway?

11:03.462 --> 11:05.930
lt was obviously
a space-dwelling life-form.

11:06.065 --> 11:09.796
Yes, but we didn't know that,
not at that point.

11:09.869 --> 11:11.564
Was it non- corporeal?

11:11.637 --> 11:13.229
ln a manner of speaking.

11:13.305 --> 11:14.237
Hostile?

11:14.306 --> 11:15.568
Well, l'm getting to that.

11:15.641 --> 11:17.700
Species 5973?

11:17.777 --> 11:18.744
Who are they?

11:18.811 --> 11:20.176
The Borg encountered them

11:20.246 --> 11:21.907
in Galactic Cluster 8.

11:21.981 --> 11:24.347
They're multispectrum
particle life-forms.

11:25.651 --> 11:27.619
No, that's not what this was.

11:27.687 --> 11:30.121
Maybe it was
an interphasic species.

11:30.189 --> 11:32.851
We can either debate
comparative xenobiology,

11:32.925 --> 11:34.756
or l can continue
with the story.

11:34.827 --> 11:36.226
Now, it's up to you.

11:39.231 --> 11:41.426
Continue the story.

11:41.500 --> 11:44.799
Somehow l thought
you'd say that.

11:44.870 --> 11:46.599
Now, where was l?

11:46.672 --> 11:48.105
Oh, uh, yes...

11:48.174 --> 11:49.607
Life aboard Voyager

11:49.675 --> 11:51.870
would have been more or less
back to normal,

11:51.944 --> 11:55.038
if it weren't
for a few strange malfunctions.

11:56.248 --> 11:57.977
Come in.

11:58.084 --> 12:00.712
l've got reports
from repair teams.

12:00.786 --> 12:03.653
lt looks like that EM discharge
did more damage than we thought.

12:03.723 --> 12:05.554
Transporter Room 1
is out of commission;

12:05.624 --> 12:07.592
half the sonic showers
are off- line,

12:07.660 --> 12:10.060
and we temporarily lost
artificial gravity

12:10.129 --> 12:11.096
on Deck 5.

12:11.163 --> 12:12.187
Any injuries?

12:12.264 --> 12:15.097
Ensign Mulcahy bumped his head
on the ceiling.

12:15.167 --> 12:16.225
Ouch.

12:17.937 --> 12:18.926
This is terrible.

12:19.038 --> 12:21.939
Computer, another cup
of coffee, black.

12:29.949 --> 12:32.884
You can add replicators
to your list.

12:32.952 --> 12:34.180
We're getting started

12:34.253 --> 12:36.551
on the wrong foot
today, my friend.

12:36.622 --> 12:37.748
Captain?

12:38.958 --> 12:39.890
l'm sorry.

12:39.959 --> 12:41.324
l was talking to Voyager.

12:41.393 --> 12:44.226
lt's nothing
to be embarrassed about.

12:44.296 --> 12:45.729
l used to have
long conversations

12:45.798 --> 12:47.060
with my Maquis ship.

12:47.133 --> 12:49.567
Really? What did you two
talk about?

12:49.635 --> 12:50.897
Oh, l can't tell you that.

12:50.970 --> 12:52.460
Captain- Starship

12:52.538 --> 12:54.096
confidentiality.

12:54.173 --> 12:55.401
Of course.

12:55.474 --> 12:57.704
lf the Doctor heard us,

12:57.777 --> 12:59.301
he'd probably recommend
counseling.

12:59.378 --> 13:01.903
l won't tell if you won't.

13:01.981 --> 13:03.676
Deal.

13:03.749 --> 13:05.842
Commander, do you see that?

13:05.918 --> 13:08.352
lt's a meteorite cluster.

13:08.420 --> 13:10.513
l doubt it's anything
to worry about.

13:10.589 --> 13:11.851
l'd tend to agree...

13:11.924 --> 13:14.552
if it weren't the same one
we passed an hour ago.

13:17.997 --> 13:19.430
- Ensign.
- Yes, ma'am.

13:19.498 --> 13:20.692
Are you conducting

13:20.766 --> 13:22.358
a survey of meteoroids, Tom?

13:22.434 --> 13:23.423
Ma'am?

13:23.502 --> 13:24.434
Check your sensors.

13:24.503 --> 13:25.868
We're traveling in circles.

13:25.938 --> 13:27.371
Not according to my readings.

13:27.439 --> 13:29.839
Tuvok, run a level- 4 diagnostic

13:29.909 --> 13:31.877
on the navigational
array.

13:31.944 --> 13:34.606
There is a malfunction
in the subprocessors.

13:34.680 --> 13:36.705
lt appears we're heading
back the way we came.

13:36.782 --> 13:38.374
All stop.

13:38.450 --> 13:39.644
Reinitialize your sensors.

13:39.718 --> 13:41.345
l'm telling you,
we rely too much

13:41.420 --> 13:43.217
on 24th- century
technology, Captain.

13:43.289 --> 13:44.950
You give me a window
and a sextant,

13:45.090 --> 13:48.958
and l guarantee l'll get you
where you want to go.

13:49.028 --> 13:50.290
We've jumped

13:50.362 --> 13:52.159
- to warp 6.
- Tom?

13:52.231 --> 13:53.493
Don't look at me.

13:53.566 --> 13:54.794
Shut down the warp engines.

13:54.867 --> 13:55.799
l can't.

13:55.868 --> 13:58.462
Manual override.

13:58.537 --> 13:59.469
No response.

13:59.538 --> 14:01.506
Bridge to Engineering.

14:04.176 --> 14:05.200
l'm reading

14:05.277 --> 14:06.335
all stop.

14:06.412 --> 14:08.710
Lieutenant Torres, respond.

14:08.781 --> 14:10.043
Computer,

14:10.115 --> 14:11.912
locate B'Elanna Torres.

14:11.984 --> 14:14.350
Lieutenant Torres
is in Engineering.

14:14.420 --> 14:17.253
Ensign Trumari
is on Deck 4, Section 30.

14:17.323 --> 14:18.790
Commander Tuvok
is on the Bridge...

14:18.858 --> 14:19.916
Find out what's going on.

14:19.992 --> 14:21.357
Crewman...

14:21.427 --> 14:23.486
Harry, pull the speech
processors if you have to,

14:23.562 --> 14:24.893
but shut that thing off.

14:24.964 --> 14:27.057
Ensign Boreck is in Engineering,
Level 2.

14:27.132 --> 14:30.260
Meanwhile, Commander Chakotay
was headed for Engineering...

14:30.336 --> 14:33.237
or so he thought.

14:35.007 --> 14:36.941
Engineering.

14:37.009 --> 14:40.604
Bet you wouldn't try
to pull this on the Captain.

14:40.679 --> 14:41.907
Have it your way.

14:41.981 --> 14:43.915
l'll walk.

14:43.983 --> 14:46.213
The turbolift started
to fall faster

14:46.285 --> 14:47.445
and faster...

14:47.519 --> 14:48.577
Anybody hungry?

14:48.654 --> 14:50.246
Neelix!

14:50.322 --> 14:52.119
You haven't touched your snacks.

14:52.191 --> 14:53.419
Snacks are irrelevant.

14:53.492 --> 14:54.891
Continue the story.

14:54.960 --> 14:56.552
What happened to
Commander Chakotay?

14:56.629 --> 15:00.861
The turbolift plunged
1 1 decks at high speed.

15:00.933 --> 15:02.525
The g- forces pinned
Commander Chakotay

15:02.601 --> 15:03.533
to the ceiling.

15:03.602 --> 15:05.399
He knew that at any minute,

15:05.471 --> 15:07.132
he was going to come
crashing down to the bottom

15:07.206 --> 15:08.730
of the turbolift,
and there was nothing

15:08.807 --> 15:10.468
that he could do about it,
but then...

15:12.044 --> 15:14.444
the descent stabilizers
reactivated.

15:14.513 --> 15:16.913
The way B'Elanna tells it

15:17.049 --> 15:18.676
Commander Chakotay
was not very happy

15:18.751 --> 15:20.912
when he showed up
in Engineering that morning.

15:20.986 --> 15:22.248
lf l didn't know any better,

15:22.321 --> 15:23.913
l'd say this ship
is trying to kill me.

15:24.056 --> 15:25.489
Do you have any idea
what's going on?

15:25.557 --> 15:26.683
Well, l've traced the problem

15:26.759 --> 15:28.317
to a series
of gel- packs on Deck 13.

15:28.394 --> 15:29.918
lt looks like
they were burned out

15:30.062 --> 15:31.620
by am EM discharge
from the nebula.

15:31.697 --> 15:34.188
And those gel- packs interface
with all the affected systems.

15:34.266 --> 15:35.597
l'm on my way
to repair it right now.

15:35.668 --> 15:37.363
Feel like giving me a hand?

15:37.436 --> 15:39.495
Only if we stay
out of the turbolifts.

15:39.571 --> 15:41.436
l'll tell you
about it on the way.

15:41.507 --> 15:44.203
While Chakotay and B'Elanna
headed for Deck 13,

15:44.276 --> 15:46.972
new problems were cropping up
all over the ship.

15:49.448 --> 15:50.676
Crewman Celes,

15:50.749 --> 15:52.216
step away
from the control panel.

15:52.284 --> 15:53.546
Did l do something wrong?

15:53.619 --> 15:55.951
You caused a power
failure in Astrometrics.

15:56.055 --> 15:57.420
l did? How?

15:57.489 --> 15:59.150
That's what l'm attempting

15:59.224 --> 16:01.158
to find out.

16:01.226 --> 16:02.693
l don't see how l could have
done anything...

16:02.761 --> 16:03.693
l've located the problem.

16:03.762 --> 16:05.821
lt appears
you inadvertently overloaded

16:05.898 --> 16:07.365
a series of EPS conduits

16:07.433 --> 16:08.764
while performing
your diagnostic.

16:08.834 --> 16:11.166
But l haven't even started
the diagnostic.

16:11.236 --> 16:12.897
Then what were you doing?

16:13.005 --> 16:14.973
Nothing. l just got here.

16:19.511 --> 16:22.207
l know that wasn't my fault.

16:25.017 --> 16:27.008
These gel- packs
aren't burned out.

16:27.086 --> 16:29.782
There's no trace
of any EM discharge.

16:29.855 --> 16:31.789
Could it have dissipated
this quickly?

16:31.857 --> 16:33.791
No, it moved.

16:33.859 --> 16:34.917
Moved?

16:35.027 --> 16:36.688
The discharge seems
to be traveling

16:36.762 --> 16:38.457
through
the bio- neural circuitry...

16:38.530 --> 16:39.929
jumping from system to system.

16:40.032 --> 16:42.000
Can you isolate it?

16:43.635 --> 16:45.694
lt's in a series of gel- packs

16:45.771 --> 16:49.207
that interface
with the environmental controls

16:49.274 --> 16:50.571
outside Cargo Bay 2.

16:50.642 --> 16:52.906
Let's try to get there
before it jumps again.

16:52.978 --> 16:55.208
By then Seven of Nine

16:55.280 --> 16:57.680
was in Cargo Bay 2
to run diagnostics,

16:57.750 --> 16:59.809
but, because the com system
was down,

16:59.885 --> 17:02.319
they couldn't warn her,
and she had no idea

17:02.388 --> 17:04.720
that something was
in the room with her.

17:04.790 --> 17:06.848
- Here?
- ln this cargo bay?

17:08.327 --> 17:09.692
Then what happened?

17:09.762 --> 17:12.663
The creature was clinging
to the circuits and bulkheads,

17:12.731 --> 17:14.631
using them to move
about the room.

17:14.700 --> 17:17.134
lt was getting
closer and closer.

17:21.140 --> 17:23.904
Seven of Nine to the Bridge.

17:25.077 --> 17:27.011
Bridge, acknowledge.

17:27.079 --> 17:29.377
But, of course,
there was no answer.

17:29.448 --> 17:31.245
Why didn't she remodulate

17:31.316 --> 17:33.546
her neural transceiver,
send a message that way?

17:33.619 --> 17:35.553
Uh, that's
an interesting question.

17:35.621 --> 17:37.054
You'll have to ask her.

17:37.122 --> 17:39.784
Stop interrupting.

17:39.858 --> 17:41.758
Seven tried to get out,

17:41.827 --> 17:43.920
but she was trapped.

18:19.898 --> 18:20.887
What happened to Seven?

18:21.033 --> 18:23.661
The entity must have infiltrated
her cybernetic systems

18:23.735 --> 18:26.033
and turned her against
the rest of the crew.

18:26.105 --> 18:27.732
lt most certainly did not.

18:27.806 --> 18:29.865
You're letting your imagination
run away with you.

18:29.942 --> 18:30.874
What happened?

18:30.943 --> 18:32.171
Why did the light go out?

18:32.244 --> 18:33.404
lt's all right.

18:33.479 --> 18:35.037
l just have
to replace the power cell.

18:35.114 --> 18:36.172
lt'll only take a moment.

18:36.248 --> 18:38.273
Nothing to be frightened about.

18:38.350 --> 18:40.682
l'm not frightened, but Azan is.

18:40.752 --> 18:42.117
l am not.

18:42.187 --> 18:42.915
There.

18:43.856 --> 18:44.914
Sorry.

18:44.990 --> 18:47.788
l didn't mean to scare you.

18:48.660 --> 18:52.027
And now, where was l?

18:52.097 --> 18:54.088
Oh, yes.

18:54.166 --> 18:57.101
Seven was trapped
by the force fields,

18:57.169 --> 18:59.069
but fortunately for her,

18:59.138 --> 19:01.003
help was on the way.

19:07.146 --> 19:08.374
Computer,

19:08.447 --> 19:09.971
deactivate this force field.

19:10.048 --> 19:12.778
We'll have to cut power
to the field generators.

19:14.453 --> 19:16.887
The computer's not accepting
my command codes.

19:16.955 --> 19:17.922
Stand back.

19:19.358 --> 19:20.450
The force field's down.

19:20.526 --> 19:22.221
Let's get her to Sick Bay.

19:22.294 --> 19:25.730
Now, most of us were
just going about our business,

19:25.797 --> 19:27.230
oblivious
to what was happening,

19:27.299 --> 19:29.426
but that was about to change.

19:30.936 --> 19:32.801
Kim to Engineering.

19:35.307 --> 19:37.502
Neelix to the Bridge.

19:40.078 --> 19:41.875
l want everyone to report
to their stations

19:41.947 --> 19:43.437
until we figure out
what's going on.

19:43.515 --> 19:45.415
Aye, sir.

19:45.484 --> 19:48.351
Uh, Ensign, uh, maybe
l should come with you.

19:48.420 --> 19:49.717
The Captain might need me.

19:49.788 --> 19:51.153
This is your post.

19:51.223 --> 19:52.690
You may be needed here.

19:52.758 --> 19:54.453
Oh, of course.

19:56.094 --> 19:58.062
lf you need anything,
anything at all,

19:58.130 --> 19:59.597
you know where to find me.

20:01.166 --> 20:02.463
So there l was.

20:02.534 --> 20:04.229
The only thing l could do
was wait...

20:04.303 --> 20:05.930
alone...

20:06.004 --> 20:08.063
in the dark.

20:09.975 --> 20:12.341
Oh... uh...

20:13.879 --> 20:16.279
Voyager was dead in space.

20:16.348 --> 20:18.339
System after system was failing,

20:18.417 --> 20:20.681
including
the environmental controls.

20:20.752 --> 20:23.118
Ensign Paris told me
it was hotter

20:23.188 --> 20:25.679
than the Tarkanian desert
on the Bridge.

20:25.757 --> 20:26.951
Don't you ever sweat?

20:27.092 --> 20:29.492
Not unless the temperature
reaches 350 degrees Kelvin,

20:29.561 --> 20:31.756
with a humidity factor
at approximately...

20:31.830 --> 20:33.058
Forget l asked.

20:33.131 --> 20:35.326
Very well.

20:35.400 --> 20:37.732
l'll make you a deal, Voyager.

20:37.803 --> 20:41.705
The next M- Class planetoid
we find, we'll set down,

20:41.773 --> 20:46.176
and l'll give you
a nice maintenance overhaul.

20:46.245 --> 20:47.837
What do you say?

20:51.783 --> 20:53.341
Tom, check the conn.

21:00.459 --> 21:01.983
l don't know
what you did, Captain,

21:02.060 --> 21:03.425
but l've got helm control back.

21:04.963 --> 21:06.931
Thanks, my friend.

21:07.065 --> 21:09.124
l'm going to try
to get thrusters

21:09.201 --> 21:10.862
and impulse engines
back on line.

21:10.936 --> 21:13.336
Tom, l'm reading an EM
surge in your console.

21:13.405 --> 21:14.667
Get away from there.

21:15.774 --> 21:17.401
Bridge to Sick Bay.
Medical emergency!

21:17.476 --> 21:18.841
Can we transport him?

21:18.910 --> 21:20.172
Transporters are off- line.

21:20.245 --> 21:21.542
Why am l not surprised?

21:22.781 --> 21:24.271
Now what?

21:24.349 --> 21:25.907
Warning.
Oxygen depletion in progress.

21:25.984 --> 21:28.043
Breathable air is being sucked
out of the Bridge.

21:28.120 --> 21:30.520
Reroute emergency power
to environmental control.

21:31.623 --> 21:32.851
No effect.

21:33.925 --> 21:36.052
Everyone out of here now!

21:38.263 --> 21:40.891
ln Sick Bay, the Doctor
had his hands full, too.

21:40.966 --> 21:42.228
You're fortunate.

21:42.301 --> 21:44.633
Another few moments
and you'd have been asphyxiated.

21:44.703 --> 21:46.398
Where do you think you're going?

21:46.471 --> 21:48.962
Lieutenant Torres needs
help with the repairs.

21:49.074 --> 21:50.405
Doctor!

21:54.846 --> 21:56.074
What happened?

21:56.148 --> 21:58.981
An EM surge- - 
Seven had a similar experience.

21:59.084 --> 22:00.381
The environmental system

22:00.452 --> 22:02.886
converted Cargo Bay 2
into a micronebula.

22:02.954 --> 22:04.922
When Gibson and
McMinn tried to vent

22:04.990 --> 22:06.218
the gas from Deck 7,

22:06.291 --> 22:08.316
they were struck
by a discharge, too.

22:08.393 --> 22:10.486
Are we thinking the same thing?

22:10.562 --> 22:12.189
lt could be an intelligence
at work here.

22:12.264 --> 22:13.822
Some kind of an electromagnetic
life-form

22:13.899 --> 22:15.491
that's using the
environmental controls

22:15.567 --> 22:17.398
to make the ship more
hospitable for itself.

22:17.469 --> 22:20.927
And attacking anyone
who tries to stop it.

22:21.006 --> 22:23.270
My matrix is destabilizing.

22:23.342 --> 22:24.934
Transfer his program
to the mobile emitter.

22:25.010 --> 22:26.910
Quickly.

22:26.978 --> 22:28.206
Warning. Power failure.

22:28.280 --> 22:30.942
Let's get the
injured out of here.

22:31.016 --> 22:34.315
Deck by deck,
section by section,

22:34.386 --> 22:36.786
the crew was losing
control of Voyager.

22:36.855 --> 22:39.380
People were scattered
throughout the ship

22:39.458 --> 22:41.653
with no idea
what was happening.

22:58.810 --> 23:00.072
What did you do that for?

23:00.145 --> 23:01.339
Ensign, l'm so sorry.

23:01.413 --> 23:02.880
l- l thought... l thought

23:02.948 --> 23:04.677
you were a Hirogen,
or- or a Borg.

23:04.750 --> 23:06.809
And what gave you that idea?

23:06.885 --> 23:08.750
lt's dark. Your shadow.

23:08.820 --> 23:10.253
Trust me, there are

23:10.322 --> 23:14.224
no aliens roaming the corridors.

23:14.292 --> 23:16.760
You mean we haven't
been boarded?

23:16.828 --> 23:18.557
lt's just a power failure.

23:18.630 --> 23:20.393
Well, isn't that what
they sometimes do?

23:20.465 --> 23:21.489
Cut the power?

23:21.566 --> 23:23.500
What who sometimes does?

23:23.568 --> 23:24.728
Hostile aliens.

23:24.803 --> 23:27.465
They might be trying
to infiltrate the ship.

23:27.539 --> 23:28.904
How long has it been

23:28.974 --> 23:30.737
since you've run
into anyone else?

23:30.809 --> 23:32.709
l don't know,
four or five hours.

23:32.778 --> 23:35.110
l- l tried Sick Bay,
but it was deserted.

23:35.180 --> 23:36.943
Decks 3 and 4 are empty.

23:37.048 --> 23:38.777
l- l was on my way to the Bridge.

23:38.850 --> 23:40.841
You're the first person
l've seen.

23:40.919 --> 23:42.944
Well, there's no one
on the Bridge either.

23:43.088 --> 23:44.612
You see?
Then maybe l was right?

23:44.689 --> 23:46.623
Maybe the reason
we can't find anyone

23:46.691 --> 23:48.852
is because they've
all been assimilated.

23:48.927 --> 23:50.258
Slow down.

23:50.328 --> 23:52.558
There was an environmental
failure on the Bridge.

23:52.631 --> 23:53.962
That's why it's been evacuated.

23:54.065 --> 23:55.760
l don't know what happened
in Sick Bay

23:55.834 --> 23:57.062
or on Decks 3 and 4,

23:57.135 --> 23:59.069
but l'm sure there's
a perfectly reasonable

23:59.137 --> 24:00.331
explanation.

24:00.405 --> 24:02.805
Uh- uh. No one's
been assimilated.

24:02.874 --> 24:04.842
Then where are they?

24:05.911 --> 24:08.379
They've probably set up
a temporary command post- -

24:08.447 --> 24:10.438
most likely, in Engineering.

24:10.515 --> 24:12.176
That's where l'm going.

24:12.250 --> 24:13.842
Can l come with you?

24:13.919 --> 24:16.217
Of course.

24:18.356 --> 24:19.448
Ensign?

24:19.524 --> 24:21.014
What?

24:21.092 --> 24:24.425
Do you think we could stop by
a weapons locker on the way?

24:24.496 --> 24:26.123
l still had no idea

24:26.198 --> 24:27.392
what was going on.

24:27.466 --> 24:29.297
l'd been waiting
in the Mess Hall

24:29.367 --> 24:30.766
for more than four hours
in the dark,

24:30.836 --> 24:32.133
cut off from the rest
of the crew.

24:35.474 --> 24:37.135
ls somebody there?

24:47.185 --> 24:48.482
Hello?

24:55.060 --> 24:56.459
Hello?

25:01.733 --> 25:03.758
Hello?

25:10.075 --> 25:12.908
ls somebody out there?

25:14.746 --> 25:16.577
Tom, if that's you,
this isn't funny.

25:43.275 --> 25:45.038
Stay away!

25:45.110 --> 25:47.670
Calm yourself, Mr. Neelix.

25:47.746 --> 25:50.772
Y- you really shouldn't sneak up
on people like that.

25:50.849 --> 25:52.316
l could have shot you.

25:52.384 --> 25:54.579
Your restraint is commendable.

25:54.653 --> 25:57.087
ls there a problem
with the air supply?

25:57.155 --> 25:58.952
An alien life-form
has seized control

25:59.057 --> 26:00.490
of Voyager's primary systems.

26:00.559 --> 26:02.823
lt's flooded numerous sections
with poisonous gas.

26:02.894 --> 26:04.862
Are you saying
that this alien life-form

26:04.930 --> 26:06.227
is trying to kill us?

26:06.298 --> 26:07.890
lts intentions aren't clear.

26:07.999 --> 26:09.489
However, we should evacuate.

26:09.568 --> 26:10.626
Where to?

26:10.702 --> 26:11.999
The Captain has established

26:12.070 --> 26:13.901
a secure command
post in Engineering.

26:14.039 --> 26:15.404
Were you scared?

26:15.473 --> 26:18.203
Well, considering that
Engineering was eight decks down

26:18.276 --> 26:19.834
and the only way
to get there was

26:19.911 --> 26:22.004
to crawl through pitch- black
Jefferies tubes...

26:22.080 --> 26:23.445
it's fair to say

26:23.515 --> 26:26.416
that l was never more frightened
in my life.

26:32.490 --> 26:35.118
You shouldn't have allowed
yourself to be afraid.

26:35.193 --> 26:36.660
ls that so?

26:36.728 --> 26:39.788
Fear distracts people
from accomplishing their goals.

26:39.864 --> 26:42.059
Well, that's true, l suppose.

26:42.133 --> 26:43.464
On the other hand,

26:43.535 --> 26:46.129
fear can sometimes
be very healthy.

26:46.204 --> 26:47.933
Explain.

26:48.073 --> 26:49.438
Well, it keeps you alert.

26:49.507 --> 26:51.236
Keeps you from putting yourself

26:51.309 --> 26:52.936
in unnecessary danger.

26:53.044 --> 26:54.409
l was afraid once.

26:54.479 --> 26:56.743
You've been afraid many times.

26:56.815 --> 26:57.907
lcheb.

26:59.084 --> 27:01.518
Do you want to tell
us about it?

27:01.586 --> 27:03.850
lt was when we were
first disconnected

27:03.922 --> 27:06.584
from the hive mind,
before Seven rescued us.

27:06.658 --> 27:09.593
l couldn't hear anyone
else's thoughts anymore.

27:09.661 --> 27:12.152
l felt alone.

27:12.230 --> 27:14.562
l can understand
why that was frightening.

27:14.633 --> 27:16.567
When you're scared,
it helps to have someone

27:16.635 --> 27:17.829
to talk to, doesn't it?

27:17.902 --> 27:18.891
Yes.

27:19.037 --> 27:20.231
Of course, in my case,

27:20.305 --> 27:23.035
the only one person l had
to talk to was Commander Tuvok.

27:23.108 --> 27:26.236
l tried passing the time
with a little conversation,

27:26.311 --> 27:28.211
but, as you've
probably noticed,

27:28.279 --> 27:30.770
he's not exactly
what you'd call chatty.

27:30.849 --> 27:34.080
l'll bet Starfleet has
specific, uh, procedures

27:34.152 --> 27:36.814
to deal with these kinds
of situations.

27:36.888 --> 27:39.914
You know, something like,
uh, Protocol 1005.

27:40.025 --> 27:41.925
ln the event your
starship is invaded

27:42.060 --> 27:44.290
by a hostile electromagnetic
life-form...

27:44.362 --> 27:45.624
What do you suppose

27:45.697 --> 27:48.598
that, uh, that protocol
would be, exactly?

27:48.667 --> 27:51.261
Rest assured, this crew
is doing everything possible

27:51.336 --> 27:52.803
to regain control of the ship.

27:52.871 --> 27:54.600
You're right.
l'm just being silly.

27:54.673 --> 27:55.935
l concur.

27:56.007 --> 27:58.237
Of course, the crew of
the Salvoxia probably thought

27:58.309 --> 28:00.607
they were going to regain
control of their ship, too.

28:00.679 --> 28:02.374
Did l ever tell you
about the Salvoxia?

28:02.447 --> 28:03.709
lf l say yes,

28:03.782 --> 28:05.716
will it prevent you
from telling the story?

28:05.784 --> 28:07.547
lt was a Talaxian freighter.

28:07.619 --> 28:08.711
Horrible tragedy.

28:08.787 --> 28:11.085
Happened nearly a century ago.

28:11.156 --> 28:13.090
After suffering
a cascade failure,

28:13.158 --> 28:15.251
it began to lose
life- support generators

28:15.326 --> 28:16.759
one by one.

28:16.828 --> 28:19.661
Pretty soon, there
wasn't enough air left

28:19.731 --> 28:21.460
to sustain the entire crew,

28:21.533 --> 28:23.364
so they began to draw lots.

28:23.435 --> 28:24.402
Can you imagine?

28:24.469 --> 28:26.903
Draw the short straw
and you suffocate?

28:26.971 --> 28:29.269
Anyway, the air
continued to diminish,

28:29.340 --> 28:31.069
and they kept drawing lots.

28:31.142 --> 28:33.201
The crew got smaller and smaller

28:33.278 --> 28:36.076
as they waited for
someone to rescue them.

28:36.147 --> 28:37.671
But no one ever came.

28:37.749 --> 28:40.217
The Salvoxia drifted
through space

28:40.285 --> 28:41.843
for the next 80 years,

28:41.920 --> 28:44.013
until somebody
finally found her.

28:44.089 --> 28:47.252
Makes me short of breath
just thinking about it.

28:47.325 --> 28:49.156
Perhaps you should
occupy your mind

28:49.227 --> 28:51.889
with pleasant thoughts,
before you hyperventilate.

28:51.963 --> 28:53.760
Right.

28:53.832 --> 28:57.233
Pleasant thoughts.
Pleasant thoughts.

28:57.302 --> 28:58.360
What did the bodies look like?

28:58.436 --> 28:59.767
l beg your pardon?

28:59.838 --> 29:01.635
After 80 years- - 
were they decomposed?

29:01.706 --> 29:04.231
They may have been preserved
by the vacuum of space.

29:04.309 --> 29:06.869
Oh. l shouldn't have told you
that story.

29:06.978 --> 29:08.104
lt's too gruesome.

29:08.179 --> 29:10.238
l wonder what the
crew of the Salvoxia

29:10.315 --> 29:13.284
did for food after their
emergency rations were gone.

29:13.351 --> 29:15.819
Maybe they ate each other.

29:15.887 --> 29:17.616
All right, uh, that's enough.

29:17.689 --> 29:18.849
Now, where was l?

29:18.923 --> 29:22.086
We'd made it more
than halfway to Engineering,

29:22.160 --> 29:24.560
when we ran into an obstacle.

29:33.605 --> 29:35.266
Commander!

29:38.109 --> 29:39.736
What do we do now?

29:39.811 --> 29:42.871
lf l can access
environmental controls,

29:42.947 --> 29:45.313
l may be able to vent the gas.

29:48.453 --> 29:49.647
ls there another way around?

29:49.721 --> 29:51.916
lt would take several hours
to reach Engineering

29:51.990 --> 29:53.855
by an alternate route.

29:53.925 --> 29:56.291
There is no guarantee
we'd find a clear path.

29:56.361 --> 29:58.921
Pleasant thoughts.

29:58.997 --> 30:00.931
Pleasant thoughts. Ah.

30:00.999 --> 30:03.024
While we were
in the Jefferies tubes,

30:03.101 --> 30:07.629
a good number of the crew
had gathered in Engineering.

30:07.705 --> 30:09.195
97 crewmen have been
accounted for.

30:09.274 --> 30:11.435
They're in secure locations
throughout the ship.

30:11.509 --> 30:12.601
Neelix?

30:12.677 --> 30:13.769
No one's seen him.

30:13.845 --> 30:15.938
l shouldn't have ordered
him to stay in the Mess Hall.

30:16.014 --> 30:18.107
You were following procedure.

30:18.183 --> 30:19.844
Captain.

30:19.918 --> 30:21.180
Bad news.

30:21.252 --> 30:23.948
The life-form's infiltrated
the main computer matrix.

30:24.088 --> 30:26.113
As long as it remained
in the gel- pack,

30:26.191 --> 30:27.886
there was a chance
to contain it.

30:27.959 --> 30:30.291
But we can't purge it
from the main computer

30:30.361 --> 30:32.829
without crashing the few
systems we have left.

30:32.897 --> 30:34.228
Things were looking grim,

30:34.299 --> 30:36.893
but the Captain was about
to make a breakthrough

30:36.968 --> 30:38.526
that would change everything.

30:38.603 --> 30:40.833
Captain Janeway.

30:40.905 --> 30:42.600
Captain Janeway.

30:42.674 --> 30:46.474
Captain Janeway
is in Main Engineering.

30:46.544 --> 30:47.943
Sorry, Captain.

30:48.012 --> 30:49.980
l know it's irritating.
l'll try to shut it down.

30:50.048 --> 30:52.539
Hold on a minute.
This is Captain Janeway.

30:52.617 --> 30:54.585
Respond.

30:54.652 --> 30:57.280
Authorization code required.

30:57.355 --> 30:59.289
Janeway- pi- alpha.

30:59.357 --> 31:00.619
Captain?

31:00.692 --> 31:02.125
lt's only a hunch...

31:02.193 --> 31:04.821
but l think this life-form
may be trying to communicate.

31:04.896 --> 31:06.921
Sounds like a com system
malfunction to me.

31:06.998 --> 31:08.260
l'm not so sure.

31:08.333 --> 31:10.267
The life-form's been moving
from system to system.

31:10.335 --> 31:12.098
lf it's intelligent
it may be learning

31:12.170 --> 31:16.607
how to use those systems
in some rudimentary way.

31:16.674 --> 31:18.608
Are you attempting
to communicate?

31:18.676 --> 31:20.769
Unable to comply.

31:20.845 --> 31:22.676
Even if it understands
what you're saying,

31:22.747 --> 31:24.112
it may not know how to respond.

31:24.182 --> 31:25.410
B'Elanna, can you call up

31:25.483 --> 31:27.280
the com system's
syntax subroutines?

31:27.352 --> 31:28.785
l'll try.

31:28.853 --> 31:30.286
We're attempting
to make it easier

31:30.355 --> 31:33.791
for you to speak to us.

31:33.858 --> 31:38.795
Try to access the database
at Engineering Station 3- 1.

31:38.863 --> 31:41.491
Database accessed.

31:45.236 --> 31:48.262
Why have you come
aboard our ship?

31:48.339 --> 31:51.866
Captain Janeway,
report to Astrometrics.

31:51.943 --> 31:54.605
Why do you want me to go there?

31:54.679 --> 31:57.978
Captain Janeway,
report to Astrometrics.

31:58.116 --> 32:00.107
l guess l'll find out
soon enough.

32:00.184 --> 32:02.118
Captain, Astrometrics is flooded

32:02.186 --> 32:03.915
with nebular gas.

32:04.055 --> 32:07.616
Astrometrics life support
has been restored.

32:07.692 --> 32:09.387
lt could be some kind of trap.

32:09.460 --> 32:11.155
This life-form, whatever it is,

32:11.229 --> 32:13.561
has already injured
at least 1 1 crewmen.

32:13.631 --> 32:16.623
l can try to establish
a dialogue,

32:16.701 --> 32:19.067
or l can let it
take over my ship.

32:19.137 --> 32:20.832
Seven, you're with me.

32:20.905 --> 32:22.429
Yes, Captain.

32:22.507 --> 32:25.601
While Captain Janeway
and Seven of Nine

32:25.677 --> 32:27.042
headed to Astrometrics,

32:27.111 --> 32:29.944
Tuvok was trying
to ease my fears by guiding me

32:30.014 --> 32:31.675
through a meditation.

32:31.749 --> 32:36.152
Concentrate on the rhythm
of your breathing.

32:36.220 --> 32:40.156
Envision your lungs
filled with light.

32:40.224 --> 32:43.455
Follow it back in time

32:43.528 --> 32:47.294
to a moment
when you felt no fear...

32:47.365 --> 32:49.731
a moment of happiness...

32:49.801 --> 32:50.927
serenity.

32:52.870 --> 32:55.236
My birthday dinner.

32:55.306 --> 32:57.206
Describe it.

32:57.275 --> 33:00.711
l was surrounded
by all my friends.

33:00.778 --> 33:03.372
They'd gotten together
to cook me dinner.

33:03.448 --> 33:05.678
They prepared
all my favorites- -

33:05.750 --> 33:10.312
steamed chadre kab,
terra nut soufflé...

33:10.388 --> 33:14.620
l felt loved...

33:14.692 --> 33:15.920
appreciated...

33:16.060 --> 33:17.357
safe.

33:21.566 --> 33:23.932
Captain Janeway
served you nebular gas?

33:24.068 --> 33:25.933
No, of course not.

33:26.037 --> 33:28.267
lt was just my imagination
playing tricks on me

33:28.339 --> 33:29.363
during the meditation.

33:29.440 --> 33:31.237
My head was too full

33:31.309 --> 33:32.936
of scary images for me to relax.

33:33.077 --> 33:34.635
The Captain, on the other hand,

33:34.712 --> 33:36.976
seemed to be getting things
under control.

33:43.888 --> 33:47.085
Review of navigational logs
in progress.

33:47.158 --> 33:50.127
Are you searching for something?

33:50.194 --> 33:52.355
Affirmative.

33:54.465 --> 33:56.456
The nebula...

33:58.903 --> 34:02.031
Manual helm control enabled.

34:02.106 --> 34:04.904
You're returning
control of the ship.

34:04.976 --> 34:06.500
Affirmative.

34:06.577 --> 34:09.569
You want me to take you
back to the nebula.

34:09.647 --> 34:11.911
Affirmative.

34:12.016 --> 34:14.643
Well, why didn't you just say so
in the first place?

34:14.719 --> 34:16.812
Returning to the nebula
is too dangerous.

34:16.888 --> 34:19.118
We'd risk invasion
by other life-forms.

34:19.190 --> 34:21.681
l'm beginning to think
this was all an accident- -

34:21.759 --> 34:22.885
not an invasion.

34:22.960 --> 34:24.449
Captain?

34:24.529 --> 34:26.087
Think about it.

34:26.164 --> 34:29.156
The EM surge didn't hit us
until our Bussard collectors

34:29.233 --> 34:31.827
destabilized the nebula,
and then what happened?

34:31.902 --> 34:35.304
The ship began experiencing
random malfunctions.

34:35.373 --> 34:38.103
l'm not so sure
they were random.

34:38.176 --> 34:39.938
Navigational sensors
were fooling us

34:40.011 --> 34:41.808
into heading back
toward the nebula,

34:41.879 --> 34:43.938
and then, when Tom tried
to resume course,

34:44.014 --> 34:45.312
he was attacked.

34:45.382 --> 34:48.944
This life-form isn't
trying to hurt us.

34:49.020 --> 34:52.148
lt's trying to get home.

34:52.223 --> 34:54.190
Can you give us access
to the Bridge?

34:54.257 --> 34:56.658
Life support on the Bridge
has been restored.

34:56.726 --> 34:59.958
Level- 10 authorization required.

35:00.098 --> 35:01.588
Level- 10.

35:01.666 --> 35:03.065
Captain's eyes only.

35:03.134 --> 35:05.864
lt wants me to go alone.

35:08.639 --> 35:11.335
The Captain and the life-form
had begun

35:11.409 --> 35:12.376
to establish a rapport,

35:12.443 --> 35:15.378
but the relationship
was fragile.

35:24.355 --> 35:26.880
ls the viewscreen
functioning normally?

35:26.958 --> 35:29.119
Affirmative.

35:33.264 --> 35:36.529
l'm sorry to tell you this...

35:36.601 --> 35:38.865
but your nebula is gone.

35:38.936 --> 35:40.494
Clarify.

35:40.571 --> 35:44.029
The gasses must have continued
to dissipate after we left.

35:44.108 --> 35:47.475
Warning. Life support failure
on all decks.

35:47.545 --> 35:48.569
Abandon ship.

35:48.646 --> 35:49.704
Abandon...

35:49.780 --> 35:51.338
Ship.

35:51.415 --> 35:52.814
Abandon ship.

35:52.884 --> 35:54.943
The creature was that angry?

35:55.019 --> 35:57.214
lts home had been destroyed.

35:57.288 --> 36:00.917
The life-form wanted
Voyager for itself,

36:00.992 --> 36:04.860
and it was going to kill
anyone who remained on board.

36:12.203 --> 36:14.262
Captain Janeway's

36:14.338 --> 36:15.999
only chance of saving her crew

36:16.073 --> 36:18.303
was to try to reason
with the creature.

36:18.376 --> 36:19.308
Listen to me.

36:19.377 --> 36:20.742
l can still help you.

36:20.811 --> 36:21.903
Abandon ship.

36:21.979 --> 36:24.038
There are other class- J nebulas.

36:24.115 --> 36:25.412
l'll find you one.

36:25.483 --> 36:26.916
Unable to comply.

36:26.984 --> 36:28.542
l'd be able to ''comply''

36:28.619 --> 36:31.213
if you gave me access
to Astrometrics.

36:31.289 --> 36:33.883
Warning.
Oxygen depletion in progress.

36:33.958 --> 36:35.789
Give me back helm control!

36:35.860 --> 36:38.556
Warning.
Helm circuits are overloading.

36:40.164 --> 36:41.825
Abandon ship.

36:41.899 --> 36:43.867
At least give me access
to the com,

36:43.935 --> 36:45.266
so l can warn my crew!

36:45.336 --> 36:46.496
Unable to comply.

36:46.571 --> 36:48.835
As the Captain was facing

36:48.906 --> 36:51.602
one of her worst fears,
losing her ship,

36:51.676 --> 36:54.736
l was with Tuvok
and about to face one of mine.

36:56.214 --> 36:57.681
Tuvok!

36:57.748 --> 36:59.238
Lie still.

36:59.317 --> 37:00.545
l'll try to...

37:03.754 --> 37:05.415
Mr. Neelix...

37:05.489 --> 37:06.751
proceed without me.

37:06.824 --> 37:08.519
l'm not leaving you here.

37:08.593 --> 37:09.855
l am injured.

37:09.927 --> 37:12.293
Logic dictates
that you take the mask

37:12.363 --> 37:14.058
and proceed to Engineering.

37:14.131 --> 37:15.621
l don't care

37:15.700 --> 37:16.860
what ''logic dictates.''

37:16.934 --> 37:18.265
This isn't the Salvoxia.

37:18.336 --> 37:19.598
We're not drawing lots.

37:19.670 --> 37:21.331
l am giving you an order.

37:21.405 --> 37:23.100
And l'm disobeying it.

37:23.174 --> 37:24.664
You're coming with me

37:24.742 --> 37:28.337
if l have to drag you by
your pointy little ears.

37:28.412 --> 37:30.004
l had no choice.

37:30.081 --> 37:32.515
l had to control my fear.

37:34.485 --> 37:37.454
Pleasant thoughts.
Pleasant thoughts.

37:42.193 --> 37:44.718
While we made our way
to Engineering,

37:44.795 --> 37:46.285
Captain Janeway tried

37:46.364 --> 37:49.500
to make the creature reconsider
what it was doing.

37:49.500 --> 37:49.727
to make the creature reconsider
what it was doing.

37:49.800 --> 37:52.166
You're going to kill everyone
on this ship.

37:52.236 --> 37:54.636
Do you understand
what that means?

37:54.705 --> 37:57.105
To deprive of life...
extinguish.

37:57.174 --> 38:00.803
Yes... and if you extinguish us,

38:00.878 --> 38:03.005
you'll be
extinguishing yourself.

38:03.080 --> 38:04.479
You need this crew.

38:04.548 --> 38:05.742
Clarify.

38:05.816 --> 38:09.411
The technology you're using
needs to be maintained.

38:09.487 --> 38:11.717
Who do you think is going
to do that when we are gone?

38:11.789 --> 38:15.225
Voyager's secondary systems
have already begun to fail.

38:15.293 --> 38:19.229
ln a few weeks, primary systems
will start to go off- line.

38:19.297 --> 38:21.390
Unable to confirm.

38:21.465 --> 38:24.195
Access the internal sensors.

38:24.268 --> 38:25.667
Run a shipwide diagnostic.

38:25.736 --> 38:27.897
See for yourself.

38:28.005 --> 38:29.097
Abandon ship.

38:30.474 --> 38:32.237
The Captain's rapport

38:32.310 --> 38:35.040
with the creature seemed
to be breaking down,

38:35.112 --> 38:37.580
and she couldn't afford
to wait any longer.

38:37.648 --> 38:39.138
l need everyone's attention.

38:39.216 --> 38:40.376
We're abandoning ship.

38:40.451 --> 38:41.782
Get to the escape pods.

38:41.852 --> 38:43.752
We may not be able
to eject the pods.

38:43.821 --> 38:45.789
We'll push them out
if we have to.

38:47.325 --> 38:48.553
He needs medical attention!

38:48.626 --> 38:49.888
lt'll have to wait.

38:49.960 --> 38:51.188
We're abandoning ship.

38:51.262 --> 38:53.628
The entire crew had to evacuate.

38:53.698 --> 38:56.690
The Delta Flyer
and the shuttles were launched,

38:56.767 --> 38:59.531
followed by all but one
of the escape pods.

38:59.603 --> 39:02.697
That's everybody but the Captain
and the First Officer.

39:02.773 --> 39:04.570
After you.

39:10.548 --> 39:12.880
l did what you asked- - 
we're abandoning ship.

39:12.983 --> 39:14.211
What more do you want?

39:14.285 --> 39:15.377
Diagnostic complete.

39:15.453 --> 39:17.717
Secondary systems off- line.

39:17.788 --> 39:20.552
Primary systems at 32 percent.

39:20.624 --> 39:24.890
Estimated time to failure- - 
six days, 13 hours.

39:24.962 --> 39:26.896
That sounds about right.

39:26.964 --> 39:30.058
Captain Janeway,
report to Engineering.

39:30.134 --> 39:32.568
Like hell, l will.

39:34.772 --> 39:37.332
l won't be your prisoner.

39:37.408 --> 39:40.377
You'll have to kill me.

39:40.444 --> 39:41.877
Acknowledged.

39:43.347 --> 39:46.043
Captain Janeway,
report to Engineering.

39:46.117 --> 39:47.641
Not until you restore

39:47.718 --> 39:49.652
life support...

39:49.720 --> 39:53.588
and give me back control
of my ship.

39:53.657 --> 39:55.386
Unable to comply.

39:57.294 --> 39:59.285
Then we'll die here together.

40:02.166 --> 40:03.963
l'm guessing...

40:05.469 --> 40:07.869
l've got
about two more minutes...

40:07.938 --> 40:09.929
and then you're on your own.

40:10.007 --> 40:13.135
Captain Janeway,
report to Engineering.

40:13.210 --> 40:14.268
l told you...

40:15.513 --> 40:17.777
...the only way l'm helping

40:17.848 --> 40:22.251
is if you return control
of my... ship!

40:23.687 --> 40:25.211
lt looked like

40:25.289 --> 40:27.689
the creature was calling
the Captain's bluff.

40:27.758 --> 40:30.727
She was down
to her final breath.

40:30.795 --> 40:32.285
But at the last moment...

40:41.705 --> 40:45.197
Access to all systems
has been restored.

40:45.276 --> 40:48.973
lt took almost two days
for the crew

40:49.046 --> 40:50.343
to return to the ship.

40:50.414 --> 40:52.575
Eventually,
an artificial environment

40:52.650 --> 40:54.675
was created
in an isolated section

40:54.752 --> 40:55.684
of Deck 12.

40:55.753 --> 40:57.084
The creature's been

40:57.154 --> 40:59.213
living there ever since.

40:59.290 --> 41:02.259
l told you there was
a monster on Deck 12.

41:02.326 --> 41:04.191
Haven't you been listening?

41:04.261 --> 41:05.626
lt's not a monster.

41:05.696 --> 41:07.323
lt's an alien life-form.

41:08.966 --> 41:10.024
What was that?

41:10.100 --> 41:13.695
Maybe it's an alien life-form
coming to get us.

41:13.771 --> 41:14.931
Haven't you learned anything

41:15.005 --> 41:16.836
about letting your imagination
get the best of you?

41:18.676 --> 41:19.904
There.

41:19.977 --> 41:21.945
That little jolt
was probably nothing more

41:22.046 --> 41:23.536
than our friend leaving the ship

41:23.614 --> 41:26.082
to go to a new home
that the Captain found for him.

41:26.150 --> 41:27.117
Time to regenerate.

41:32.523 --> 41:34.684
What if the life-form
didn't leave?

41:34.758 --> 41:36.453
What if it wants revenge?

41:36.527 --> 41:38.461
Well...

41:38.529 --> 41:41.726
w- what if l told you
l made up the whole thing?

41:41.799 --> 41:44.700
Naomi told me you
always exaggerate.

41:44.768 --> 41:47.635
l knew the story wasn't true
the moment you said

41:47.705 --> 41:50.435
the Bussard collectors
produced nadion emissions.

41:50.508 --> 41:52.533
l should've known better

41:52.610 --> 41:55.636
than to try fooling
the four of you.

41:55.713 --> 41:57.544
All right, in you go.

42:06.490 --> 42:08.458
Pleasant dreams.

42:15.499 --> 42:16.761
How are the children?

42:16.834 --> 42:19.268
Tucked in their alcoves,
safe and sound.

42:19.336 --> 42:21.099
l hope they weren't frightened.

42:21.171 --> 42:23.765
Oh... why would they
be frightened, Captain?

42:23.841 --> 42:26.105
They were in the dark
for three hours.

42:26.176 --> 42:27.768
Oh, no, not to worry.

42:27.845 --> 42:30.405
l told them a story
to pass the time.

42:30.481 --> 42:32.176
Let me guess- - ''Mother Goose.''

42:32.249 --> 42:33.841
Certainly not.

42:33.918 --> 42:37.877
Some of those fairy tales
can be frightening- - ogres

42:37.955 --> 42:39.115
and child- eating monsters.

42:39.189 --> 42:41.623
Speaking of which,
is everything... okay?

42:41.692 --> 42:43.956
We're just taking
some final readings

42:44.061 --> 42:45.460
before we resume course.

42:45.529 --> 42:46.689
Show him, Harry.

42:53.337 --> 42:55.271
Well...

42:55.339 --> 42:58.274
l hope it lives
happily ever after.
