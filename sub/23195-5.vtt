Rhythm Method

00:45.758 --> 00:47.618
Huh, you draw in the notes section too?

00:47.765 --> 00:51.112
Oh, I'm just writing a little not to give to Jenny after the scrim.

00:52.067 --> 00:53.367
Not a love note,

00:53.398 --> 00:56.310
or anything like that. I mean, she totally has a boyfriend

00:56.920 --> 00:58.240
who hates me.

00:58.692 --> 01:00.493
Nah, it's more of a

01:00.680 --> 01:02.881
"It's all cool, you know, let's...

01:03.054 --> 01:05.096
let's be friends" sort of note.

01:07.507 --> 01:10.214
Oh. I like to draw extra lines to make it graph paper.

01:10.245 --> 01:12.853
Yo Brian, man. Kick ass out there.

01:13.158 --> 01:14.162
Thanks man.

01:14.192 --> 01:15.721
I will give it my best shot.

01:15.751 --> 01:18.606
Good, cause we have two weeks allowance on you beating The Law.

01:21.480 --> 01:24.728
Alright. Settle down. Settle down people. Settle down.

01:24.759 --> 01:27.283
I am proud to be your TA for rhythm gaming this year

01:27.313 --> 01:28.701
A sport...

01:28.730 --> 01:30.286
of true champions.

01:30.531 --> 01:33.682
Something you two losers in the back could stand to learn something about.

01:38.299 --> 01:41.143

Freddie Wong!

01:49.984 --> 01:50.984
My dad!

01:52.599 --> 01:53.799
Sup losers.

01:54.322 --> 01:55.972
Or should I say heroes?

01:56.626 --> 01:58.240
Nope. All losers.

01:58.269 --> 02:00.671
Thats all right. That's why you took this class.

02:00.701 --> 02:02.689
To learn from the best, me,

02:02.825 --> 02:04.275
Freddie Wong. Hero.

02:06.477 --> 02:07.767
Alright. Whew!

02:07.796 --> 02:09.252
First rule of heroism.

02:09.282 --> 02:10.925
Give the people what they want.

02:14.370 --> 02:15.688
See, when you're a hero,

02:15.718 --> 02:17.302
people want to be you.

02:18.721 --> 02:20.197
They want to do you.

02:20.777 --> 02:22.854
They want to be you while they do you.

02:23.293 --> 02:24.385
Oh my god.

02:25.793 --> 02:26.843
Be careful.

02:26.872 --> 02:30.340
Cause if you don't give the people what they want, they'll divorce you,

02:30.371 --> 02:32.201
they'll take your sweet dirt bike,

02:32.231 --> 02:35.211
and they'll leave you with a no good loser for a son.

02:39.971 --> 02:40.971
Yeeha!

02:56.812 --> 02:59.706
Grip the steering wheel of destiny!

03:09.086 --> 03:10.268
Drift.

03:14.421 --> 03:15.722
What are you...?

03:17.355 --> 03:19.806
Nooooooooo!

03:20.141 --> 03:21.962
So, who wants some pizza?

03:23.241 --> 03:26.081
Ted, are you sure you are ok, man? That was, like, really rough.

03:27.560 --> 03:30.592
100% Big D. I just gotta refuel.

03:31.556 --> 03:33.032
Ok. Umm...

03:33.278 --> 03:36.036
Well, I have to get to scrimmage, buddy. But...

03:36.066 --> 03:38.537
Ki can you take care of him for a little while?

03:38.567 --> 03:39.567
I'm on it.

03:40.111 --> 03:41.412
Good luck Brian.

03:41.588 --> 03:43.133
- Alright. - Ya man, don't...

03:43.282 --> 03:45.149
Don't worry about me. Good dad out there.

03:45.179 --> 03:46.778
I mean, good love dad.

03:47.019 --> 03:48.486
Good luck Brian.

03:49.844 --> 03:50.844
See ya.

03:51.064 --> 03:55.748
End of Seventh Period One Hour Remains

03:56.033 --> 03:57.618
Go get 'em Brian.

03:57.649 --> 03:59.141
Break the Law!

03:59.653 --> 04:01.353
Thanks man. Cool slogan.

04:03.030 --> 04:05.629
The Law Vs Brian D Justice will be served

04:12.640 --> 04:15.977
I'll get to everybody, I'll get to everybody. Hold your horses. Calm down.

04:16.007 --> 04:18.123
Hey! Give me twenty big ones on Brian D.

04:18.281 --> 04:20.550
Alright, a risk taker, huh? I like that.

04:21.180 --> 04:22.880
Hey. Speak of the devil.

04:26.565 --> 04:28.327
There you go. Who's next? Who's next?

04:28.358 --> 04:30.891
What ya got? What ya got? I'll take yeah. I'll make your bet for ya.

04:30.920 --> 04:34.069
That's fine with me. What ya want? Ten on Law. There ya go. Boom.

04:34.100 --> 04:36.974
Hey man. Look, I was thinking, maybe you can just do some fancy foot work

04:37.004 --> 04:38.884
or caps lock and run away when you're out there.

04:38.913 --> 04:41.992
Cause I am betting you can make it at least three minutes against The Law.

04:44.228 --> 04:46.528
Say hi to The Law for me, Brian.

04:47.552 --> 04:48.890
No pressure.

04:49.894 --> 04:52.995
The Junior Varsity Pre-Game Meeting - Thirty Minutes Remain -

04:53.242 --> 04:55.848
Ok. Jpop, Rico, Moriarity,

04:55.995 --> 04:57.412
Left Flank is all you.

04:57.797 --> 04:59.106
Jumping Jax!

04:59.136 --> 05:01.685
I want to see those grenade skills in action.

05:01.714 --> 05:04.137
And as for the little freshman that could,

05:04.166 --> 05:05.858
stay tight and out of sight.

05:06.795 --> 05:07.799
Any questions?

05:07.829 --> 05:11.992
Yeah. Isn't this scrimmage just an excuse for your boyfriend to pad his kill reel.

05:14.970 --> 05:16.279
Ya. You're right.

05:16.309 --> 05:18.229
Varsity is out there to show off.

05:18.454 --> 05:21.516
We. We're out there to kick ass.

05:22.110 --> 05:24.334
Stay calm, stick the plan...

05:25.180 --> 05:28.133
and we're gonna wipe the smirk right off their faces.

05:28.586 --> 05:30.766
And as for my boyfriend...

05:31.545 --> 05:35.551
that maggot isn't gonna talk to me for a week after we're through with him!

05:35.581 --> 05:37.194
- Sound good? - Yeah!

05:37.225 --> 05:39.794
Alright. See you on the battlefield. Dismissed.

05:51.487 --> 05:52.487
Hey...

05:53.773 --> 05:55.879
rad speech. I mean...

05:55.908 --> 05:57.358
consider me pumped.

05:59.689 --> 06:01.087
Do you need something?

06:01.786 --> 06:04.893
Nope. I just thought you might want to check this out.

06:05.199 --> 06:07.747
Bam! New DXM, fresh import.

06:08.348 --> 06:12.473
And uh, you might want to check out the notes section. B-t-dubs.

06:13.846 --> 06:14.846
This is...

06:15.017 --> 06:16.779
pretty cool actually.

06:17.125 --> 06:20.199
But I have to stay focused right now.

06:21.399 --> 06:22.699
You should too, Brian.

06:23.221 --> 06:25.288
Yah. No, totally.

06:26.617 --> 06:27.617
Well.

06:27.947 --> 06:30.146
If you ever want to get unfocused...

06:35.540 --> 06:36.540
Hey.

06:37.519 --> 06:39.120
I've seen the posters.

06:39.586 --> 06:42.493
This is team CTF, not a deathmatch.

06:43.134 --> 06:45.201
You follow my orders, you'll be fine.

06:46.726 --> 06:48.085
You got it captain.

06:50.146 --> 06:53.689
Brian's Private Pre-Game Pump Up Five MInutes Remain

06:54.507 --> 06:56.122
Stay frosty B.D.

06:56.721 --> 06:58.562
Jenny wants you to avoid The Law.

06:58.593 --> 06:59.943
Consider it done.

07:00.425 --> 07:03.024
They won't even know I'm there. Ninja style.

07:03.053 --> 07:05.538
He made a whole soda can disappear in my mouth.

07:12.906 --> 07:14.767
Victory burgers after the game?

07:15.132 --> 07:17.031
More like defeateritos.

07:17.170 --> 07:18.626
Defeateritoes with cheese.

07:18.803 --> 07:23.213
Speaking of dead meat, what was Jenny thinking putting BrianD on her team?

07:23.509 --> 07:25.281
She was probably thinking I'm awesome.

07:25.310 --> 07:27.856
Guys, Jenny wasn't thinking,

07:28.122 --> 07:29.865
she was following orders.

07:30.298 --> 07:32.838
Wait. You told her to put him on the team?

07:32.867 --> 07:34.295
Course Cold Turkey.

07:34.521 --> 07:37.515
Cause while I love a well earned victory burg,

07:37.545 --> 07:40.410
what I really love, more than anything,

07:40.725 --> 07:41.875
is to kill...

07:42.014 --> 07:43.727
Brian D.

07:44.189 --> 07:47.319
That big baby Brian is bound to burn, bro.

07:47.985 --> 07:49.536
Nice one Alliterator.

07:50.093 --> 07:51.540
He's going down in flames.

07:51.786 --> 07:53.026
In front of everyone.

07:53.055 --> 07:54.865
And when the smoke clears...

07:55.180 --> 07:56.687
there will be no doubt

07:56.718 --> 07:58.076
that he was anything

07:58.105 --> 08:00.988
but a worthless, no talent fluke.

08:02.160 --> 08:05.201
With cheese.

08:10.565 --> 08:11.762
So uh, lets go.

08:11.793 --> 08:13.180
- Yep! - Alright then!

08:25.141 --> 08:26.241
Oh, Brian...

08:32.173 --> 08:34.890
- What's he doing? - Costing me five hundred bucks!

08:34.921 --> 08:36.982
Get with the program Brian.

08:44.022 --> 08:47.035
Brian, I am going to the intel. Get to that structure and cover me.

08:47.065 --> 08:50.874
You know, I think I will just stick back here and nade spam, sir.

08:58.044 --> 09:00.298
Damnit Brian, what is your malfunction?

09:00.585 --> 09:02.759
Is The Law going to be waiting for me up there?

09:03.429 --> 09:06.165
Follow my orders, or get off my team.

09:49.241 --> 09:50.314
Avenge me.

10:04.514 --> 10:05.714
Damnit, Brian.

10:11.991 --> 10:12.991
Yeah!

10:20.053 --> 10:22.103
Give the people what they want.

10:23.688 --> 10:26.376
Yeah! Come on Brian! Woo!
