02:51.713 --> 02:52.839
Hey.

03:01.557 --> 03:03.641
Hey, baby. What's going on here?

03:03.725 --> 03:04.851
Oh, hi.

03:26.415 --> 03:28.082
Miss Golightly.

03:30.752 --> 03:33.170
Some day... Some day...

03:33.338 --> 03:34.881
Miss Golightly.

03:37.426 --> 03:38.926
What happened to you, anyway?

03:39.011 --> 03:41.679
You take off for the powder room
and that's the last I see you.

03:41.763 --> 03:44.432
- Now, really, Harry...
- Harry was the other guy.

03:44.558 --> 03:47.685
I'm Sid . Sid Arbuck.
You like me, remember?

03:47.769 --> 03:51.439
Miss Golightly, I protest!

03:52.357 --> 03:55.026
Oh, darling, I am sorry,
but I lost my key.

03:55.110 --> 03:56.944
But that was two weeks ago.

03:57.070 --> 03:59.780
You cannot go on
and keep ringing my bell.

03:59.865 --> 04:03.034
You disturb me!
You must have a key made!

04:03.285 --> 04:05.620
But it won't do any good.
I just lose them all.

04:05.746 --> 04:08.039
Come on, baby. You like me.
You know you do.

04:08.123 --> 04:09.373
I worship you, Mr Arbuck,

04:09.458 --> 04:12.126
- but good night, Mr Arbuck.
- Baby, wait a minute. What is this?

04:12.210 --> 04:14.086
You like me. I'm a liked guy.

04:14.713 --> 04:16.130
You like me, baby. You know you do.

04:16.255 --> 04:18.048
Didn't I pick up the check
for five people?

04:18.132 --> 04:19.634
Your friends.
I've never seen them before.

04:19.718 --> 04:21.969
And when you asked for a little change
for the powder room,

04:22.053 --> 04:23.804
what do I give you? A $50 bill.

04:23.931 --> 04:26.390
Now doesn't that give me some rights?

04:26.475 --> 04:29.101
In 30 seconds I going to call the police!

04:29.895 --> 04:33.064
All the time disturbance! I get no sleep!

04:33.398 --> 04:35.733
I got to get my rest! I'm an artist!

04:36.151 --> 04:38.819
I am going to call the vice squad on you!

04:38.946 --> 04:41.656
Don't be angry, you dear little man,
I won't do it again.

04:41.823 --> 04:42.823
If you promise not to be angry,

04:42.950 --> 04:45.785
I might let you take those pictures
we mentioned.

04:46.411 --> 04:47.536
When?

04:48.622 --> 04:49.872
Sometime.

04:51.792 --> 04:53.042
Anytime.

04:53.794 --> 04:55.044
Good night.

06:19.838 --> 06:23.632
I'm sorry to bother you, but I couldn't get
the downstairs door open.

06:26.094 --> 06:28.429
I guess they sent me the upstairs key.

06:28.513 --> 06:30.931
I couldn't get the downstairs door open.

06:33.310 --> 06:37.646
I said, I guess they sent me
the upstairs key.

06:37.773 --> 06:41.233
I couldn't get the downstairs door open.
I'm sorry to wake you.

06:41.318 --> 06:42.943
That's quite all right.

06:44.112 --> 06:46.989
It could happen to anyone,
quite frequently does. Good night.

06:47.115 --> 06:48.449
I hate to...

06:50.118 --> 06:53.454
I hate to bother you,
but if I could ask one more favor

06:53.622 --> 06:55.331
could I use the phone?

06:56.958 --> 06:58.084
Sure.

06:58.960 --> 07:00.127
Why not?

07:01.171 --> 07:02.421
Thank you.

07:03.673 --> 07:05.341
Well, this is

07:06.134 --> 07:08.469
a nice little place you've got here.

07:08.929 --> 07:12.348
- You just moved in, too?
- No. I've been here about a year.

07:12.933 --> 07:14.517
The phone's over there.

07:15.811 --> 07:17.144
Well, it was.

07:18.647 --> 07:19.980
Oh, I remember.

07:20.273 --> 07:23.442
I stuck it in the suitcase.
Kind of muffles the sound.

07:31.118 --> 07:32.368
I'm sorry.

07:33.870 --> 07:35.788
- Is he all right?
- Sure.

07:36.164 --> 07:38.374
Sure. He's okay, aren't you, cat?

07:38.708 --> 07:40.334
Poor old cat.

07:40.877 --> 07:44.547
Poor slob. Poor slob without a name.

07:44.881 --> 07:47.258
The way I look at it,
I don't have the right to give him one.

07:47.342 --> 07:50.761
We don't belong to each other.
We just took up by the river one day.

07:50.846 --> 07:52.429
I don't even want to own anything

07:52.514 --> 07:55.516
until I find a place where
me and things go together.

07:55.684 --> 07:59.145
I'm not sure where that is,
but I know what it's like.

08:00.689 --> 08:02.231
It's like Tiffany's.

08:02.357 --> 08:04.859
Tiffany's?
You mean the jewelery store?

08:04.985 --> 08:06.193
That's right.

08:06.820 --> 08:08.863
I'm crazy about Tiffany's.

08:10.198 --> 08:11.198
Listen.

08:12.159 --> 08:14.994
You know those days when you
get the mean reds?

08:15.537 --> 08:17.788
The mean reds?
You mean like the blues?

08:17.873 --> 08:18.956
No.

08:19.040 --> 08:22.209
The blues are because you're getting fat
or maybe it's been raining too long.

08:22.335 --> 08:24.211
You're just sad, that's all.

08:24.963 --> 08:26.797
The mean reds are horrible.

08:26.882 --> 08:30.134
Suddenly you're afraid and you
don't know what you're afraid of.

08:30.218 --> 08:33.345
- Do you ever get that feeling?
- Sure.

08:34.014 --> 08:36.472
Well, when I get it,
the only thing that does any good

08:36.558 --> 08:39.058
is to jump into a cab and go to Tiffany's.

08:39.227 --> 08:40.977
Calms me down right away.

08:41.897 --> 08:43.813
The quietness and the proud look of it.

08:43.899 --> 08:46.400
Nothing very bad
could happen to you there.

08:46.568 --> 08:48.485
If I could find a real-life place

08:48.570 --> 08:51.238
that made me feel like Tiffany's, then...

08:52.365 --> 08:55.409
Then I'd buy some furniture
and give the cat a name.

08:57.829 --> 08:59.705
I'm sorry. You wanted something.

09:00.248 --> 09:01.749
The telephone.

09:02.209 --> 09:04.501
It's just that I was supposed
to meet somebody.

09:04.586 --> 09:07.713
I mean, this is
10: 00 Thursday morning, isn't it?

09:07.839 --> 09:10.674
I just got off a plane from Rome
and I'm not too sure.

09:10.759 --> 09:13.594
Thursday. Is this Thursday?

09:13.678 --> 09:16.263
- I think so.
- Thursday! Oh, no, it can't be!

09:16.348 --> 09:17.932
It's too gruesome.

09:20.936 --> 09:24.188
Well, what's so gruesome
about Thursday?

09:24.397 --> 09:27.274
Nothing, except I can never remember
when it's coming up.

09:27.400 --> 09:29.276
Wednesdays,
I generally just don't go to bed at all

09:29.402 --> 09:31.779
because I have to be up to catch
the 10:45.

09:31.863 --> 09:34.615
And they're so particular
about visiting hours.

09:34.908 --> 09:36.617
Would you be a darling
and look under the bed

09:36.701 --> 09:38.953
and see if you can find
a pair of alligator shoes?

09:39.037 --> 09:40.120
Sure.

09:42.707 --> 09:44.708
I've got to do something
about the way I look.

09:44.793 --> 09:47.962
I mean, a girl just can't go to Sing Sing
with a green face.

09:48.046 --> 09:49.255
Sing Sing?

09:50.382 --> 09:52.967
Yes, I always thought it was
a ridiculous name for a prison.

09:53.051 --> 09:57.054
Sing Sing, I mean . It sounds more like it
should be an opera house or something.

09:57.138 --> 09:58.764
Black alligator.

09:59.557 --> 10:02.893
You know, all the visitors make an effort
to look their best. It's only fair.

10:02.978 --> 10:05.980
Actually, it's very touching, all the
women wearing their prettiest things.

10:06.106 --> 10:08.565
I just love them for it.
And I love the kids, too.

10:08.650 --> 10:10.484
I mean the kids the wives bring.

10:10.568 --> 10:12.987
It should be sad seeing kids there,
but it isn't.

10:13.071 --> 10:16.240
They all have ribbons in their hair
and lots of shine on their shoes.

10:16.324 --> 10:17.992
You'd think there was going to be
ice cream.

10:18.076 --> 10:20.744
Now, as I understand it,
what we're doing is getting you ready

10:20.829 --> 10:23.247
- to visit somebody at Sing Sing.
- That's right.

10:23.331 --> 10:26.083
You can always tell what kind of person
a man really thinks you are

10:26.167 --> 10:28.002
by the earrings he gives you.

10:28.336 --> 10:30.170
I must say, the mind reels.

10:30.338 --> 10:31.672
May I ask whom?

10:31.756 --> 10:34.258
Whom what?
Oh, whom I go to visit, you mean?

10:34.342 --> 10:35.926
I guess that's what I mean.

10:36.011 --> 10:38.012
I don't know
that I should even discuss it.

10:38.096 --> 10:40.347
Well, they never told me
not to tell anyone.

10:40.432 --> 10:42.850
You must cross your heart
and kiss your elbow.

10:43.018 --> 10:44.143
I'll try.

10:44.811 --> 10:47.688
You probably read about him.
His name's Sally Tomato.

10:47.814 --> 10:49.106
Sally Tomato?

10:49.190 --> 10:50.441
Well, don't look so shocked.

10:50.525 --> 10:51.775
They could never prove for a second

10:51.860 --> 10:54.278
that he was even part of the Mafia,
much less head of it, my dear.

10:54.362 --> 10:57.197
The only thing they did prove was
that he cheated his income tax a little.

10:57.282 --> 10:59.867
Anyway, all I know
is that he's a darling old man.

10:59.993 --> 11:02.202
Oh, he was never my lover
or anything like that.

11:02.329 --> 11:04.455
In fact, I never knew him
until after he was in prison.

11:04.539 --> 11:05.706
But I adore him now.

11:05.832 --> 11:08.625
I mean, I've been going to see him
every Thursday for seven months.

11:08.710 --> 11:11.045
Now I think I'd go
even if he didn't pay me.

11:11.171 --> 11:13.130
- Shoes.
- I could only find one.

11:17.385 --> 11:18.719
He pays you?

11:18.887 --> 11:20.971
That's right. Or anyway his lawyer does.

11:21.056 --> 11:23.724
If he is a lawyer, which I doubt, since
he doesn't seem to have an office,

11:23.850 --> 11:25.225
only an answering service.

11:25.310 --> 11:28.187
And he always wants to meet you
at Hamburger Heaven.

11:30.357 --> 11:32.983
There you are, you sneak. Thank you.

11:33.068 --> 11:34.151
You're welcome.

11:34.235 --> 11:36.195
Dress. Dress.

11:36.738 --> 11:39.573
Here we are. Bag and a hat, too.

11:40.909 --> 11:41.992
There we are.

11:42.077 --> 11:45.746
Anyway, about seven months ago, this
so-called lawyer, Mr O'Shaughnessy,

11:45.872 --> 11:47.915
asked me how I'd like to cheer up
a lonely old man

11:48.041 --> 11:50.417
and pick up $ 100 a week
at the same time.

11:50.585 --> 11:54.088
I told him, "Look, darling,
you've got the wrong Holly Golightly."

11:54.214 --> 11:56.840
A girl can do as well as that
on trips to the powder room.

11:56.925 --> 11:58.759
I mean, any gentleman
with the slightest chic

11:58.885 --> 12:01.011
will give a girl a $50 bill
for the powder room.

12:01.096 --> 12:03.764
And I always ask for cab fare, too.
That's another $50.

12:03.890 --> 12:06.225
But then he said his client was
Sally Tomato.

12:06.309 --> 12:09.228
He said dear old Sally had seen me
at Elmo's or somewhere

12:09.312 --> 12:11.438
and had admired me à la distance.

12:11.523 --> 12:14.274
So wouldn't it be a good deed
if I were to visit him once a week?

12:14.359 --> 12:17.444
Well, how could I say no?
It was all so wildly romantic.

12:19.447 --> 12:20.864
How do I look?

12:22.409 --> 12:25.035
Very good . I must say I'm amazed.

12:25.495 --> 12:28.580
You were a darling to help,
I could never have done it without you.

12:28.665 --> 12:31.125
- Bag.
- Call me anytime.

12:32.585 --> 12:36.213
I'm just upstairs, or I will be
as soon as I get moved in.

12:36.297 --> 12:37.381
Bye, cat.

12:44.180 --> 12:47.641
You mean he gives you $ 100
for an hour's conversation?

12:48.017 --> 12:49.810
Well, Mr O'Shaughnessy does
as soon as I meet him

12:49.894 --> 12:51.937
and give him the weather report.

12:52.355 --> 12:54.189
Look, it's none of my business,
but it sounds to me

12:54.274 --> 12:56.024
like you could get in a lot of trouble.

12:56.109 --> 12:57.860
Hold this for me, will you?

13:00.530 --> 13:02.823
And what do you mean,
"weather report"?

13:03.366 --> 13:05.701
Oh, that's just a message I give
Mr O'Shaughnessy.

13:05.785 --> 13:08.162
So he'll know I've really been up there.

13:08.246 --> 13:10.497
Sally tells me things to say like

13:10.582 --> 13:12.791
"There's a hurricane in Cuba"

13:12.876 --> 13:15.836
and, "It's cloudy over Palermo."
Things like that.

13:16.087 --> 13:19.381
You don't have to worry.
I've taken care of myself for a long time.

13:27.599 --> 13:28.724
Taxi!

13:36.483 --> 13:38.901
- I never could do that.
- It's easy.

13:47.327 --> 13:48.410
Paul.

13:49.662 --> 13:51.788
I'm late. I know it.

13:54.501 --> 13:57.085
Don't tell me you were locked out?
Didn't you get the key?

13:57.170 --> 14:00.088
Oh, darling . I'm so sorry.

14:02.258 --> 14:03.842
No, I got the key, all right.

14:03.927 --> 14:07.179
Miss Golightly, my neighbor,
was kind enough to let me in.

14:08.264 --> 14:09.848
Miss Golightly's on her way
to Sing Sing.

14:09.933 --> 14:12.017
Just visiting, of course.

14:12.310 --> 14:15.854
Miss Golightly,
Mrs Falenson, my decorator.

14:16.356 --> 14:18.774
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

14:20.109 --> 14:23.278
Darling . Let me look at you.

14:23.780 --> 14:25.864
- Are you through?
- Was the flight absolutely ghastly?

14:25.949 --> 14:27.574
I'm in a terrible rush.

14:28.117 --> 14:30.953
Grand Central Station,
and step on it, darling.

14:32.330 --> 14:35.916
Is it really only three weeks
since I left you in Rome?

14:36.000 --> 14:37.584
Seems like years.

14:37.961 --> 14:39.962
- You seen the apartment?
- Not yet.

14:40.797 --> 14:43.507
I know it was wicked of me,
but I couldn't resist.

14:43.591 --> 14:45.634
I went ahead and fixed it up without you.

14:45.718 --> 14:47.135
I think it's darling of course

14:47.220 --> 14:51.473
but if you absolutely hate it, we can rip
everything up and start from scratch.

15:02.986 --> 15:04.987
Miss Golightly!

15:06.781 --> 15:09.241
Hey, baby! Where you going?

15:11.703 --> 15:14.538
Come on, baby. Open the door.

15:16.124 --> 15:17.416
Be a pal.

15:18.293 --> 15:20.961
You're breaking up a beautiful party.

15:23.548 --> 15:25.632
Come on, baby. Open the door.

15:26.092 --> 15:28.051
Hey, the band's swinging.

15:29.637 --> 15:31.388
Come on, baby.

15:33.141 --> 15:37.227
Miss Golightly.
Once again, I must protest!

15:37.520 --> 15:40.480
If you don't stop that phonograph
right this minute,

15:40.565 --> 15:43.150
I'm going to call the police department!

15:45.111 --> 15:47.696
Yeah . That's more better.

15:51.784 --> 15:53.201
What's the matter, baby?

15:58.291 --> 16:01.627
Come on . You're a great kid.
Open the door.

16:04.547 --> 16:07.132
Come on, baby. I'm waiting for you.

17:07.068 --> 17:10.487
- It's all right. It's only me.
- Now, wait a minute. Miss...

17:10.655 --> 17:12.698
Golightly. Holly Golightly.

17:13.574 --> 17:16.076
I live downstairs.
We met this morning, remember?

17:16.160 --> 17:17.243
Yeah.

17:18.871 --> 17:20.872
It's all right. She's gone.

17:21.958 --> 17:24.751
I must say,
she works late hours for a decorator.

17:25.294 --> 17:27.587
The thing is, I have
the most terrifying man downstairs.

17:27.672 --> 17:29.631
I mean,
he's sweet when he isn't drunk

17:29.716 --> 17:33.093
but let him start lapping up the vino,
and oh, golly, quel beast.

17:33.177 --> 17:36.430
It finally got so tiresome down there,
I just went out the window.

17:41.477 --> 17:43.770
Look, you can throw me out
if you want to,

17:43.855 --> 17:47.023
but you did look so cosy in here, and
your decorator friend had gone home

17:47.108 --> 17:50.777
and it was beginning to get a bit cold
out there on the fire escape.

17:51.404 --> 17:53.822
And I always heard
people in New York

17:53.906 --> 17:56.032
never get to know their neighbors.

17:57.368 --> 18:00.579
Well, how was Sing Sing?

18:01.164 --> 18:02.205
Fine.

18:03.541 --> 18:05.584
I made the train and everything.

18:05.668 --> 18:07.794
And what's the weather report?

18:08.254 --> 18:11.548
"Small-craft warnings
Block Island to Hatteras."

18:11.632 --> 18:13.133
Whatever that means.

18:16.345 --> 18:19.055
You know, you're sweet. You really are.

18:21.100 --> 18:23.935
And you look
a little like my brother Fred.

18:24.228 --> 18:26.396
Do you mind if I call you Fred?

18:26.481 --> 18:27.856
Not at all.

18:32.653 --> 18:34.404
$300, she's very generous.

18:36.324 --> 18:38.241
Is it by the week, the hour or what?

18:38.326 --> 18:40.076
Okay, the party's over. Out.

18:40.161 --> 18:43.121
Oh, Fred . Darling Fred, I'm sorry.

18:43.581 --> 18:46.750
I didn't mean to hurt your feelings.
Don't be angry.

18:47.335 --> 18:50.003
I was just trying to let you know
I understand.

18:50.129 --> 18:51.963
I understand completely.

18:53.090 --> 18:55.258
It's okay, stick around.
Make yourself a drink.

18:55.343 --> 18:56.676
Throw me my robe
and I'll make you one.

18:56.761 --> 18:58.053
You stay right where you are.

18:58.137 --> 19:00.388
You must be absolutely exhausted.

19:01.015 --> 19:02.808
I mean, it is very late

19:02.892 --> 19:05.310
and you were sound asleep
and everything.

19:06.896 --> 19:10.023
I suppose you think I'm very brazen
or très fou or something.

19:10.107 --> 19:12.150
I don't think you're any fouer
than anybody else.

19:12.235 --> 19:14.986
Yes, you do. Everybody does.
And I don't mind.

19:15.071 --> 19:18.448
It's useful being top banana
in the shock department.

19:21.744 --> 19:23.453
What do you do, anyway?

19:23.538 --> 19:27.290
- I'm a writer, I guess.
- You guess? Don't you know?

19:28.334 --> 19:31.294
Okay. Positive statement.
Ringing affirmative.

19:32.129 --> 19:33.588
I'm a writer.

19:34.924 --> 19:38.176
The only writer I've ever been out with
is Benny Shacklett.

19:38.261 --> 19:41.638
He's written an awful lot
of television stuff, but quel rat.

19:43.057 --> 19:45.267
Tell me, are you a real writer?

19:45.476 --> 19:49.479
I mean, does anybody buy
what you write or publish it or anything?

19:50.439 --> 19:52.732
They bought what's in that box.

19:54.235 --> 19:55.318
Yours?

19:56.571 --> 19:58.029
All these books?

19:58.114 --> 19:59.906
Well, there's just the one book.

19:59.991 --> 20:01.408
Twelve copies of it.

20:01.492 --> 20:03.702
"Nine Lives by Paul Varjak."

20:04.996 --> 20:06.371
They're stories.

20:07.081 --> 20:08.415
Nine of them.

20:10.126 --> 20:11.418
Tell me one.

20:12.753 --> 20:15.297
They're not the kind of stories
you can really tell.

20:15.423 --> 20:16.590
Too dirty?

20:18.175 --> 20:22.012
Yeah, I suppose they're dirty, too,
but only incidentally.

20:22.430 --> 20:27.183
Mainly they're angry, sensitive,
intensely felt

20:27.643 --> 20:30.478
and that dirtiest of all dirty words,
promising.

20:31.606 --> 20:35.275
Or so said The Times Book Review,
October 1 st, 1956.

20:36.027 --> 20:38.278
- 1956?
- That's right.

20:39.447 --> 20:43.783
I suppose this is kind of a ratty question,
but what have you written lately?

20:44.452 --> 20:46.870
Lately I've been working on a novel.

20:47.121 --> 20:50.290
- Lately, since 1956?
- Well, a novel takes a long time.

20:50.374 --> 20:54.085
- I want to get it exactly right.
- So no more stories.

20:54.170 --> 20:55.795
Well, the idea is

20:55.880 --> 20:59.174
I'm supposed to not fritter
my talent away on little things.

20:59.300 --> 21:01.801
I'm supposed to be saving it
for the big one.

21:02.803 --> 21:04.846
Tell me, do you write every day?

21:04.972 --> 21:06.014
Sure.

21:06.807 --> 21:08.475
- Today?
- Sure.

21:09.477 --> 21:11.728
- It's a beautiful typewriter.
- Of course.

21:11.812 --> 21:15.148
It writes nothing but sensitive,
intensely felt, promising prose.

21:15.316 --> 21:17.150
But there's no ribbon in it.

21:17.818 --> 21:19.819
- There isn't?
- No.

21:21.489 --> 21:22.530
Oh.

21:25.576 --> 21:27.577
You know, something you said
this morning has been

21:27.662 --> 21:29.287
bothering me all day.

21:29.372 --> 21:30.664
What's that?

21:31.415 --> 21:34.501
Do they really give you $50
whenever you go to the powder room?

21:34.585 --> 21:35.835
Of course.

21:36.921 --> 21:38.672
You must do very well.

21:39.006 --> 21:42.008
I'm trying to save,
but I'm not very good at it.

21:48.099 --> 21:50.892
You know,
you do look a lot like my brother Fred.

21:51.686 --> 21:55.605
I haven't seen him, of course,
since I was 14. That's when I left home.

21:56.190 --> 21:57.941
And he was already 6'2".

21:59.276 --> 22:02.404
I guess it must have been
the peanut butter that did it.

22:02.697 --> 22:06.700
Everybody thought he was dotty the way
he gorged himself on peanut butter.

22:07.702 --> 22:09.452
But he wasn't dotty.

22:10.204 --> 22:13.873
Just sweet and vague and terribly slow.

22:16.252 --> 22:19.713
Poor Fred . He's in the army now.

22:20.214 --> 22:24.050
It's really the best place for him
until I can get enough money saved.

22:24.218 --> 22:27.137
- And then?
- And then Fred and I...

22:29.056 --> 22:30.890
I went to Mexico once.

22:31.308 --> 22:34.269
It's a wonderful place for raising horses.

22:35.229 --> 22:37.772
I saw one place near the sea that...

22:38.899 --> 22:40.942
Fred's very good with horses.

22:42.778 --> 22:44.571
But even land in Mexico
costs something.

22:44.655 --> 22:47.073
And no matter what I do,
there never seems to be more than

22:47.158 --> 22:49.576
a couple of hundred dollars in the bank.

22:51.245 --> 22:53.246
It can't be 4: 30.

22:54.582 --> 22:56.082
It just can't.

23:01.756 --> 23:04.591
Do you mind if I just get in with you
for a minute?

23:06.343 --> 23:08.595
It's all right. Really, it is.

23:10.097 --> 23:11.973
We're friends, that's all.

23:15.770 --> 23:17.687
We are friends, aren't we?

23:18.981 --> 23:20.106
Sure.

23:27.990 --> 23:29.032
Okay.

23:30.367 --> 23:32.285
Let's don't say another word.

23:33.621 --> 23:35.455
Let's just go to sleep.

23:58.145 --> 23:59.646
Where are you, Fred?

24:01.982 --> 24:03.817
Because it's cold.

24:08.697 --> 24:10.949
There's snow and wind.

24:13.285 --> 24:16.329
What is it? What's the matter?

24:19.166 --> 24:20.792
Why are you crying?

24:26.507 --> 24:30.510
If we're going to be friends, let's just
get one thing straight right now.

24:31.679 --> 24:33.138
I hate snoops.

25:24.565 --> 25:27.400
- Yeah.
- Lucille, darling? 2-E.

25:29.195 --> 25:31.571
I've been trying desperately
to reach you.

25:31.697 --> 25:33.072
Bill just got back.

25:33.199 --> 25:34.866
A day early, the beast.

25:35.075 --> 25:37.243
So I'm afraid I'll have to beg off.

25:37.369 --> 25:39.787
You'll explain to the rest of the girls?

25:41.040 --> 25:42.582
You're a darling.

25:42.917 --> 25:45.418
Maybe we can have
a long lunch tomorrow.

25:46.253 --> 25:48.254
I'll phone you in the morning.

25:49.089 --> 25:50.423
Whatever you say.

25:50.799 --> 25:53.718
And you will manage to survive
without me tonight?

25:53.886 --> 25:54.928
Sure.

25:55.596 --> 25:58.598
I might even take
a wild, boyish fling at writing.

25:59.934 --> 26:01.935
- Good night.
- Good night.

26:27.419 --> 26:29.921
You got yourself stuffed
Polly, baby?

26:30.589 --> 26:32.465
Serves you right, big mouth.

26:37.304 --> 26:39.806
Buongiorno.

26:40.808 --> 26:42.350
Aren't you drinking?

26:44.353 --> 26:48.481
You got pockets there or something?
What do you go by?

26:49.191 --> 26:52.277
What's your name? What's your name?
What do you call yourself?

26:52.361 --> 26:55.905
- Irving.
- Perfect. Perfect.

26:55.990 --> 26:57.782
That's wonderful, Irving.

26:59.368 --> 27:01.494
I'll be right back, Irving, baby.

27:08.627 --> 27:11.212
Yeah? Kid's still in the shower.
You expected?

27:11.338 --> 27:13.089
I was invited . That what you mean?

27:13.173 --> 27:16.092
Now don't get yourself
all tense and sore, pal . Come on in.

27:16.176 --> 27:19.929
It's a party. There's a lot of characters
come around here, they're not expected.

27:20.014 --> 27:21.180
I'll buy you a drink. You drink?

27:21.307 --> 27:22.348
- Yeah.
- Then I'll buy you a drink.

27:22.474 --> 27:23.516
Okay.

27:24.476 --> 27:27.186
Hey, honey, your skirt's split there.

27:27.980 --> 27:29.147
- What do you drink, kid?
- Bourbon.

27:29.231 --> 27:30.315
Bourbon?

27:30.399 --> 27:32.608
- On the rocks?
- Yeah . No. With water.

27:32.693 --> 27:34.444
All right, you want rocks first, though,
don't you?

27:34.528 --> 27:35.862
- Yeah.
- Good, you got them.

27:35.988 --> 27:38.698
- Not too much.
- All right. That'll set you free.

27:39.366 --> 27:41.826
- You know the kid long?
- Not very. I live upstairs.

27:41.910 --> 27:44.120
You're kidding.
Boy, look at this place, will you?

27:44.204 --> 27:46.914
What a place. It's unbelievable.
What a dump.

27:47.207 --> 27:48.333
What do you think?

27:48.417 --> 27:51.169
- About what?
- Is she or isn't she?

27:52.046 --> 27:53.671
Wait a minute. Hold it.

27:56.717 --> 27:58.217
- Harriet.
- Hi, J.B.

27:58.344 --> 27:59.802
"J.B."? O.J. What is that?

27:59.887 --> 28:01.137
All right. Hello there.

28:01.221 --> 28:03.056
- You know Gil.
- Yeah . How are you? Good to see you.

28:03.182 --> 28:04.599
- How about a drink?
- Fine. In the kitchen.

28:04.725 --> 28:07.185
- You'll find everything you need.
- Thanks.

28:08.228 --> 28:11.022
So... Oh, honey, that is you, that is you.

28:11.732 --> 28:14.233
Fred, darling,
I'm so glad you could come.

28:14.651 --> 28:16.986
I brought you a house present,
something for the bookcase.

28:17.071 --> 28:18.738
You're sweet.

28:20.491 --> 28:23.159
Doesn't that look nice?
Give me a cigarette, O.J.

28:23.243 --> 28:24.327
Sure, sure.

28:24.411 --> 28:26.913
O.J.'s a great agent. He knows
a terrific lot of phone numbers.

28:26.997 --> 28:28.664
What's Jerry Wald's
phone number, O.J.?

28:28.749 --> 28:29.832
Oh, come on, lay off.

28:29.917 --> 28:32.585
Darling, I want you to call him
and tell him what a genius Fred is.

28:32.711 --> 28:33.753
Yeah, I got it.

28:33.879 --> 28:37.256
Stop blushing, Fred.
You didn't say you were genius, I did.

28:37.758 --> 28:40.343
So quit stalling, O.J.
Just tell me what you're going to do

28:40.427 --> 28:41.761
to make Fred rich and famous.

28:41.887 --> 28:45.014
Now why don't you let Fred baby
and me settle that matter, puppy?

28:45.099 --> 28:47.266
Okay. But just remember, I'm the agent.

28:47.351 --> 28:49.852
He's already got a decorator,
I'm the agent.

28:51.021 --> 28:52.397
Hold it. Hold it.

28:53.273 --> 28:55.108
Hi, there, boys. Come on in, there.

28:55.192 --> 28:58.194
Right in the kitchen,
you'll find everything you need.

29:00.197 --> 29:01.906
So, listen, Fred baby.

29:02.449 --> 29:05.118
- No, it's Paul baby.
- Oh, it is? I thought it was Fred baby.

29:05.202 --> 29:06.285
- No.
- Well, answer the question, all right?

29:06.412 --> 29:09.205
- Is she or isn't she?
- Is she or isn't she what?

29:09.623 --> 29:10.790
A phoney.

29:11.083 --> 29:13.126
I don't know. I don't think so.

29:13.252 --> 29:16.796
You don't think so?
Well, you're wrong, she is.

29:17.381 --> 29:20.967
But on the other hand, you're right,
because she's a real phoney.

29:21.051 --> 29:23.636
You know why? Because she
honestly believes all this phoney junk

29:23.720 --> 29:24.720
that she believes in.

29:24.805 --> 29:28.224
I mean it. Now look, I like the kid.
I mean, I sincerely like the kid . I do.

29:28.308 --> 29:29.809
I mean, I'm sensitive, that's why.

29:29.893 --> 29:32.145
I mean, you gotta be sensitive
to like the kid, you know what I mean?

29:32.271 --> 29:33.896
It's what you call a touch,
a streak of the poet,

29:33.981 --> 29:34.981
you know what I mean?

29:35.107 --> 29:36.232
You known her long?

29:36.316 --> 29:37.733
Are you kidding?
I'm the guy that discovered her.

29:37.818 --> 29:38.985
I'm O.J. Berman.

29:39.069 --> 29:40.570
A couple of years ago,
back on the coast there.

29:40.654 --> 29:43.156
She was just a kid . Of course,
she had a lot of style. A lot of class.

29:43.240 --> 29:45.491
- A lot of what?
- Class. I said she had lot of class.

29:45.576 --> 29:47.243
But of course,
when she opened her mouth,

29:47.327 --> 29:49.996
you didn't know what she was talking,
whether she was a hillbilly or an Okie.

29:50.122 --> 29:51.998
You know how long it took me
to smooth out that accent?

29:52.082 --> 29:53.332
- No.
- I'll tell you how long.

29:53.459 --> 29:55.626
One year. You know how we did it?

29:56.086 --> 29:57.336
We gave her French lessons. Yeah.

29:57.463 --> 29:58.838
Figured once she could
imitate French,

29:58.964 --> 30:00.840
she'd have no trouble imitating English.

30:00.966 --> 30:04.010
And, finally, when I thought she'd be
ready, I arranged for a little screen test.

30:04.094 --> 30:06.596
Well, the night before the screen test...
Well, I could've killed myself.

30:06.680 --> 30:08.514
The night before the screen test,
the phone rings.

30:08.599 --> 30:10.683
I pick it up, I said, "O.J. speaking ."
She says, "This is Holly."

30:10.767 --> 30:13.019
I says, "Holly? Holly, you sound
so far away, honey. What's with you?"

30:13.103 --> 30:14.187
She says, "I'm in New York."

30:14.271 --> 30:15.605
I said, "What?
You got a screen test tomorrow."

30:15.689 --> 30:18.024
She says, "I'm in New York because
I've never been to New York before."

30:18.108 --> 30:19.358
I said, "Get yourself on the plane.
Get back here."

30:19.485 --> 30:20.526
She says, "I don't wanna."

30:20.652 --> 30:22.612
I say, "What do you mean,
you don't wanna? What do you want?"

30:22.696 --> 30:24.697
She says, "I don't wanna."
I say, "What do you want?"

30:24.781 --> 30:27.617
She says, "When I find out what I want,
I'm gonna let you know." Bang.

30:27.701 --> 30:30.536
- So, look, Fred baby, you know...
- It's Paul baby.

30:30.621 --> 30:32.955
Paul baby. Sure. I mean,
don't tell me that she isn't a phoney.

30:33.040 --> 30:34.123
You know what I mean?

30:34.208 --> 30:37.126
Irving . Honey, Irving,
where have you been?

30:54.144 --> 30:55.311
Great, thanks.

30:55.395 --> 30:58.189
Mike, darling,
I tried reaching you all day long.

30:58.690 --> 31:00.483
Your answering service doesn't answer.

31:00.567 --> 31:02.276
You know the trouble people have
with answering services.

31:02.361 --> 31:05.029
Well, I guess so.
Careful your mother never...

31:05.447 --> 31:07.156
She's been running around.

31:07.658 --> 31:09.242
You look so wonderful.

31:09.660 --> 31:13.246
I know. And after all that she said
about him, and he knows that.

31:14.706 --> 31:16.123
Holly.

31:24.174 --> 31:25.466
- Time, darling.
- What?

31:25.551 --> 31:26.717
The time?

31:26.802 --> 31:28.427
- Do you have a watch?
- No, I don't.

31:28.512 --> 31:31.973
- Let me see it. It's 6:45.
- Thank you so much, dear.

31:33.517 --> 31:34.976
Can I borrow it?

31:43.026 --> 31:45.152
Really, was that necessary?

32:01.253 --> 32:04.672
This is some party.
Who are all these people, anyhow?

32:04.840 --> 32:06.924
Who knows? The word gets out.

32:07.426 --> 32:09.468
You don't mind, do you, darling?

32:10.679 --> 32:12.221
Reinforcements.

32:16.184 --> 32:18.352
- Where do I put it?
- Right in there.

32:32.034 --> 32:33.284
Holly.

32:35.662 --> 32:38.080
Holly, darling.

32:38.457 --> 32:41.876
- What's that?
- Mag Wildwood.

32:42.669 --> 32:45.921
She's a model, believe it or not,
and a thumping bore.

32:46.673 --> 32:49.467
But just look at the goodies
she brought with her.

32:51.511 --> 32:55.222
He's all right, I suppose, if you like
dark, handsome, rich-looking men

32:55.307 --> 32:57.391
with passionate natures
and too many teeth.

32:57.476 --> 32:59.977
I don't mean that one.
I mean the other one.

33:02.731 --> 33:05.691
- The other one?
- He's Rusty Trawler.

33:06.693 --> 33:08.069
Rusty Trawler.

33:08.278 --> 33:11.864
He happens to be the ninth-richest man
in America under 50.

33:13.617 --> 33:17.745
Now that indeed is a remarkable piece
of information to have at your fingertips.

33:17.829 --> 33:19.747
I keep track of these things.

33:20.791 --> 33:24.126
- Excuse me. You owe me $47...
- Hold this a minute, will you, darling?

33:26.797 --> 33:28.798
Mag, darling, what are you doing here?

33:28.882 --> 33:32.635
Honey, I was upstairs
working with Yunioshi.

33:32.719 --> 33:35.012
Easter stuff for the Bazaar.

33:35.097 --> 33:38.307
Then these two nice boys came
to pick me up.

33:38.392 --> 33:42.061
It was a mistake, of course.
My wires got crossed somewhere.

33:42.145 --> 33:44.563
They were both very sweet about it.

33:44.648 --> 33:48.109
May I present José da Silva Pereira?

33:48.193 --> 33:50.444
He's from Brazil.

33:50.612 --> 33:52.363
Miss Golightly.

33:54.449 --> 33:57.660
Very kind of you, Miss Golightly,
to allow me to attend your party.

33:57.744 --> 34:00.496
I'm so interested
in North American culture.

34:00.997 --> 34:03.582
I've been already, of course,
to the Statue of Liberty

34:03.667 --> 34:06.127
and to the restaurant Automatique.

34:06.211 --> 34:10.464
But this is the first time
I'm in a typical North American home.

34:10.549 --> 34:14.092
Wouldn't he just melt in your mouth?

34:14.177 --> 34:15.928
And this is Mr Rusty Trawler.

34:16.012 --> 34:17.471
Miss Golightly.

34:17.639 --> 34:19.931
You're not vexed at me
for bringing them?

34:20.016 --> 34:22.143
- Of course not, darling.
- I'm glad.

34:22.226 --> 34:25.228
Now, who's going to bring me
a bourbon?

34:25.313 --> 34:27.106
- O.J.
- Yeah?

34:28.024 --> 34:31.025
- Would you get Miss Wildwood a drink?
- Yeah . Which one's Miss Wildwood?

34:31.110 --> 34:35.239
Mr Berman, we haven't been
formally introduced,

34:35.322 --> 34:38.659
but I'm Mag Wildwood
from Wildwood, Arkansas.

34:38.744 --> 34:40.453
That's hill country.

34:40.536 --> 34:42.371
You just make yourself
right at home, senor.

34:42.456 --> 34:43.789
Oh, do not trouble yourself.

34:43.873 --> 34:47.877
I'm contented to stand observing
the customs of your country.

34:47.960 --> 34:49.335
Okay, you do that.

34:49.963 --> 34:51.547
Now, come along, Mr Trawler.

34:51.630 --> 34:54.382
Let's see what we can find
to amuse you with.

35:51.149 --> 35:53.275
Oh, no.

35:53.360 --> 35:56.028
No, no, no.

36:09.793 --> 36:11.085
I wasn't supposed to pick you up.

36:11.211 --> 36:13.504
You said you would pick me up,
and at the last minute, I had Gil come...

36:13.588 --> 36:16.757
Look, I wasn't supposed to pick you up,
here or anywhere.

36:20.804 --> 36:22.930
- Yes?
- Miss Golightly?

36:23.557 --> 36:25.558
This time I'm warning you.

36:25.934 --> 36:29.562
I am definitely this time going to
calling the police!

36:46.496 --> 36:47.955
Good evening.

36:49.416 --> 36:51.125
Is it something important?

36:51.251 --> 36:53.127
No. Just the guy upstairs.

36:53.253 --> 36:54.628
Complaining about the noise.

36:54.754 --> 36:55.963
He's angry.

36:56.590 --> 36:59.091
Well, he did mention something
about calling the police.

36:59.175 --> 37:01.677
Oh, the police. The police?

37:01.761 --> 37:05.431
Oh . That I cannot have. I'd better
look for Miss Wildwood and go.

37:08.810 --> 37:11.186
To think I'd find a beau of mine,

37:11.271 --> 37:14.315
mousing after a piece of
cheap Hollywood trash.

37:14.441 --> 37:17.109
- Mag, darling, you're being a bore.
- Shut up.

37:18.278 --> 37:21.697
You . You know what's going to
happen to you?

37:22.198 --> 37:27.119
I am going to march you over to the zoo
and feed you to the yak.

37:27.871 --> 37:30.122
Just as soon as I finish this drink.

37:39.341 --> 37:41.467
Timber!

39:12.642 --> 39:13.809
Sorry.

39:16.062 --> 39:17.271
Good evening, Ed.

39:17.397 --> 39:18.564
- It's Paul baby.
- Oh, yes.

39:18.648 --> 39:20.232
- You remember Irving, don't you?
- Yeah . Hi, Irving.

39:20.316 --> 39:22.651
- This is José.
- Nice to meet you, José.

39:23.611 --> 39:25.404
- Wonderful seeing you.
- Yes.

39:25.905 --> 39:27.281
Jewel thieves.

39:55.018 --> 39:56.685
Sally helps me with my accounts.

39:56.770 --> 39:58.979
I have no head for figures at all.

39:59.147 --> 40:02.858
I'm trying desperately to save
some money. You know, I told you.

40:02.942 --> 40:04.651
I just can't seem to.

40:05.111 --> 40:07.279
He makes me write down
everything in there.

40:07.363 --> 40:09.323
What I get, what I spend.

40:10.283 --> 40:13.869
I used to have a checking account,
but he made me get rid of that.

40:13.953 --> 40:19.124
He feels, for me, anyway, that it's better
to operate on a cash basis, tax-wise.

40:20.335 --> 40:24.505
Some day, Mr Fred, you take this book,
turn it into a novel.

40:24.756 --> 40:28.300
Everything is there.
Just fill in a little of the details.

40:28.510 --> 40:30.636
Certainly would be good
for some laughs.

40:30.762 --> 40:32.971
No. No, I don't think so.

40:33.473 --> 40:35.808
This is a book would break the heart.

40:36.684 --> 40:39.978
"Mr Fitzsimmons, powder room, $50."

40:40.313 --> 40:42.231
"Less $ 18."

40:42.315 --> 40:45.234
"Repair one black satin dress."

40:45.318 --> 40:47.444
"Cat food, 27 cents."

40:47.946 --> 40:51.156
Sally, darling, please stop.
You're making me blush.

40:51.491 --> 40:54.952
But you're right about
Jack Fitzsimmons, he's an absolute rat.

40:55.829 --> 40:59.039
I guess, of course,
I don't really know anybody but rats.

40:59.332 --> 41:01.291
Except, of course, Fred here.

41:02.377 --> 41:04.461
You do think Fred is nice,
don't you, Sally?

41:04.629 --> 41:07.631
For you, I hope he is.

41:14.305 --> 41:15.973
Give me a kiss goodbye.

41:18.017 --> 41:20.644
Goodbye, Uncle Sally. Till next week.

41:21.980 --> 41:23.397
Goodbye, Uncle Sally.

41:23.523 --> 41:25.440
Goodbye and don't forget
to send that book, eh?

41:25.525 --> 41:26.733
I won't.

41:29.362 --> 41:31.405
What about the weather report?

41:31.531 --> 41:32.739
Oh, yes.

41:32.866 --> 41:36.368
Snow flurries expected this weekend
in New Orleans.

41:41.040 --> 41:44.042
Snow flurries expected this weekend
in New Orleans?

41:44.878 --> 41:46.670
Isn't that just the weirdest?

41:46.754 --> 41:50.215
I bet they haven't had snow
in New Orleans for a million years.

41:50.758 --> 41:52.926
I don't know how he thinks them up.

42:06.399 --> 42:08.984
Moon River

42:09.068 --> 42:12.446
Wider than a mile

42:12.906 --> 42:17.242
I'm crossing you in style

42:17.744 --> 42:20.204
Some day

42:22.040 --> 42:26.084
Oh, dream maker

42:27.128 --> 42:31.048
You heartbreaker

42:31.591 --> 42:35.552
Wherever you're going

42:36.262 --> 42:39.556
I'm going your way

42:41.226 --> 42:45.312
Two drifters

42:45.813 --> 42:49.441
Off to see the world

42:49.609 --> 42:54.196
There's such a lot of world

42:54.280 --> 42:56.657
To see

42:58.660 --> 43:01.787
We're after

43:03.289 --> 43:05.582
The same

43:07.168 --> 43:10.754
Rainbow's end

43:12.131 --> 43:15.342
Waiting 'round the bend

43:17.804 --> 43:21.807
My huckleberry friend

43:22.100 --> 43:25.352
Moon River

43:27.647 --> 43:30.816
And me

43:39.200 --> 43:41.952
- Hi.
- Hi.

43:42.453 --> 43:44.663
- What you doing?
- Writing.

43:44.789 --> 43:45.998
Good.

43:55.466 --> 43:56.842
Well, hello.

43:57.969 --> 44:01.013
- What's wrong?
- I don't know.

44:01.681 --> 44:03.515
It's probably nothing.

44:04.976 --> 44:07.352
I want to see if he's still there.

44:07.687 --> 44:10.480
See if who's still there?
What are you talking about?

44:13.943 --> 44:15.027
Look.

44:22.618 --> 44:25.996
See? I noticed him yesterday afternoon.

44:26.706 --> 44:30.042
I didn't say anything,
I didn't want to sound neurotic

44:30.460 --> 44:33.837
- but when he's there again today...
- Who do you think he is?

44:34.172 --> 44:37.632
It could be anybody, of course,
but what crossed my mind was

44:38.885 --> 44:41.636
suppose Bill's having us watched?

44:44.515 --> 44:46.558
Okay, I'll take care of this.

44:47.560 --> 44:49.895
No. No, don't. Please.

44:50.521 --> 44:53.648
Look, if that's what it is,
you'll only make everything worse.

44:53.733 --> 44:55.901
I'll be careful . You wait here.

44:56.152 --> 44:58.653
Darling, please don't.
I don't think you should.

44:58.738 --> 45:00.072
Now take it easy.

45:00.198 --> 45:03.033
I just want to find out
what this is all about.

46:48.264 --> 46:50.265
All right, what do you want?

46:51.350 --> 46:53.977
Son, I need a friend.

47:06.657 --> 47:08.825
That's me. That's her.

47:09.452 --> 47:11.286
That's her brother Fred.

47:20.046 --> 47:21.713
You're Holly's father?

47:23.216 --> 47:24.841
Her name ain't Holly.

47:25.384 --> 47:27.385
She was Lula Mae Barnes.

47:27.637 --> 47:29.513
Was till she married me.

47:29.680 --> 47:31.848
I'm her husband, Doc Golightly.

47:34.393 --> 47:35.810
Paul Varjak.

47:37.188 --> 47:39.397
I'm a horse doctor. Animal man.

47:40.066 --> 47:42.567
Do some farming, too,
near Tulip, Texas.

47:44.070 --> 47:46.571
Her brother Fred's
getting out of the army soon.

47:46.656 --> 47:48.323
Lula Mae belongs home
with her husband,

47:48.407 --> 47:50.242
her brother and her children.

47:50.326 --> 47:51.493
Children?

47:53.162 --> 47:54.663
Them's her children.

47:54.914 --> 47:56.706
She's got four children?

47:57.083 --> 48:00.252
Now, son, I didn't claim they was
her natural-born children.

48:00.378 --> 48:03.171
Their own precious mother,
precious woman

48:03.506 --> 48:06.841
passed away July the 4th,
Independence Day, 1955,

48:06.926 --> 48:08.510
the year of the drought.

48:08.594 --> 48:11.388
When I married Lula Mae,
she was going on 14.

48:11.764 --> 48:14.349
Now, you might think
the average person going on 14

48:14.433 --> 48:16.226
wouldn't know his own mind.

48:16.602 --> 48:18.311
But you take Lula Mae.

48:19.021 --> 48:21.022
She was an exceptional person.

48:25.861 --> 48:26.945
I'll tell you, son,

48:27.029 --> 48:30.448
she just plumb broke our hearts
when she run off like she done.

48:30.533 --> 48:32.367
Just plain had no reason.

48:33.286 --> 48:35.787
All the housework was done
by her daughters.

48:35.955 --> 48:38.081
Lula Mae could just take it easy.

48:38.708 --> 48:41.126
I tell you, that woman got positively fat

48:41.210 --> 48:44.421
while her brother,
he growed up into a giant.

48:45.423 --> 48:48.258
Which is a sight different
from the way they come to us.

48:48.342 --> 48:50.927
A couple of wild young'uns, they was.

48:51.429 --> 48:54.723
I caught them outside the house
stealing milk and turkey eggs.

48:54.890 --> 48:56.891
Lula Mae and her brother
had been living

48:56.976 --> 49:00.061
with some mean, no-account people
about 100 mile east of Tulip.

49:00.563 --> 49:03.231
She had good cause to run off
from that house.

49:03.316 --> 49:05.317
Never had none to leave mine.

49:07.737 --> 49:10.238
What about her brother?
Didn't he leave, too?

49:10.323 --> 49:12.991
No, sir. We had Fred with us
till they took him in the army.

49:13.075 --> 49:15.869
That's what I come to talk to her about.
I had a letter from him.

49:15.953 --> 49:17.746
He's getting out of the army in February.

49:17.830 --> 49:20.540
That's why I got on a Greyhound bus
to come to get her.

49:20.625 --> 49:24.336
Lula Mae's place is with her husband,
her children, and her brother.

49:27.340 --> 49:30.050
It's the prize in the Cracker Jack.
You want it?

49:32.678 --> 49:34.971
Never could understand
why that woman run off.

49:36.682 --> 49:38.600
Don't tell me she weren't happy.

49:39.060 --> 49:41.186
Talky as a jaybird she was.

49:41.270 --> 49:43.563
With something smart to say
on every subject.

49:43.648 --> 49:45.440
Better than the radio.

49:45.941 --> 49:48.401
The night I proposed, I cried like a baby.

49:48.611 --> 49:51.696
She said, "What you want to cry for,
Doc? Of course we'll be married."

49:51.781 --> 49:53.907
"I've never been married before."

49:54.116 --> 49:57.869
Well, I had to laugh and to hug
and to squeeze her.

49:58.371 --> 50:00.497
"Never been married before."

50:04.293 --> 50:07.712
Listen, son.
I advised you I need a friend.

50:09.048 --> 50:11.883
'Cause I don't want to surprise
or scare her none.

50:12.385 --> 50:14.552
Be my friend . Let her know I'm here.

50:23.938 --> 50:25.814
Will you do that for me, son?

50:30.736 --> 50:33.238
Yeah, sure, Doc. If that's what you want.

50:34.532 --> 50:35.699
Come on.

50:47.336 --> 50:48.670
All right.

50:49.588 --> 50:50.755
Coming.

50:54.677 --> 50:56.803
Oh, darling, I'm just on my way out.

50:56.887 --> 50:59.097
I was supposed to be at 21
half an hour ago.

50:59.181 --> 51:01.474
Maybe we can have a drink
or something tomorrow?

51:01.559 --> 51:03.184
Sure, Lula Mae,

51:03.686 --> 51:05.687
if you're still here tomorrow.

51:10.192 --> 51:11.943
Oh, please, where is he?

51:13.320 --> 51:17.824
Fred?

51:19.827 --> 51:20.952
Gosh.

51:21.746 --> 51:22.871
Lula Mae.

51:28.586 --> 51:32.797
Gee, honey, don't they feed you
up here? You're so skinny.

51:38.471 --> 51:41.556
- Hi, Doc.
- Gosh, Lula Mae.

51:42.433 --> 51:44.350
Kingdom come.

52:44.662 --> 52:46.496
What is it? What's the matter?
Are you all right?

52:46.580 --> 52:49.082
I guess so. No, I'm not.

52:49.959 --> 52:51.709
- Fred, will you help me?
- If I can.

52:51.794 --> 52:54.045
I want you to come to the bus station
with us, Doc and me.

52:54.129 --> 52:56.297
- What?
- He still thinks I'm going back with him.

52:56.382 --> 52:58.758
I need support.
I don't think I can play this scene alone.

52:58.843 --> 53:00.510
Holly, what can I do?
He's your husband.

53:00.594 --> 53:03.346
- No, he's not.
- He's not?

53:04.098 --> 53:06.808
It was annulled ages ago,
but he just won't accept it.

53:06.892 --> 53:09.936
Please, Fred . I'll tell him
you're coming to see us off.

53:10.020 --> 53:11.729
Don't say anything.

53:13.232 --> 53:16.192
Just meet us out front in about an hour.
Please?

53:22.783 --> 53:25.493
You wait right here, honey.
I'll get the bag.

53:29.164 --> 53:31.082
Why don't I get some magazines?

53:31.166 --> 53:33.376
Please, Fred . Don't leave me.

53:33.794 --> 53:35.044
Attention, please.

53:35.129 --> 53:38.089
Leaving from platform five,
through coach to Dallas,

53:38.173 --> 53:40.800
Philadelphia, Columbus, Indianapolis,
Terre Haute,

53:40.885 --> 53:44.220
St. Louis, Tulsa, Oklahoma City,
Denison, Dallas.

53:44.305 --> 53:46.180
Come on, Lula Mae. That's us.

53:46.348 --> 53:48.391
Doc, I'm not coming with you.

53:49.018 --> 53:52.437
Come on . Let's walk together quietly
and I'll try and help you understand.

53:52.521 --> 53:54.314
Help me talk to him, Fred.

53:54.398 --> 53:55.440
It's all right, son.

53:55.524 --> 53:58.902
I appreciate you wanna help,
but it's between Lula Mae and me.

53:59.153 --> 54:00.320
Sure, Doc.

54:03.657 --> 54:05.491
I love you, Lula Mae.

54:06.160 --> 54:08.411
I know you do,
and that's just the trouble.

54:08.495 --> 54:11.998
It's a mistake you always made, Doc,
trying to love a wild thing.

54:12.082 --> 54:14.751
You were always lugging home
wild things.

54:15.085 --> 54:17.337
Once it was
a hawk with a broken wing

54:17.421 --> 54:20.715
and another time it was
a full-grown wildcat with a broken leg.

54:20.799 --> 54:21.966
Remember?

54:22.051 --> 54:23.217
Lula Mae, there's something...

54:23.302 --> 54:25.678
You mustn't give your heart
to a wild thing.

54:25.763 --> 54:27.722
The more you do, the stronger they get.

54:27.806 --> 54:31.225
Until they're strong enough to run
into the woods or fly into a tree.

54:31.310 --> 54:33.937
And then to a higher tree
and then to the sky.

54:34.021 --> 54:36.689
Lula Mae, there's something
I got to tell you.

54:36.857 --> 54:39.609
A couple of weeks ago,
I got a letter from young Fred.

54:39.693 --> 54:42.695
From Fred? He's all right, isn't he?

54:43.739 --> 54:45.698
Yeah, he's fine, I guess.

54:45.783 --> 54:47.408
He's getting out of the army in February.

54:47.493 --> 54:50.453
- That's what he wrote to tell me.
- In February?

54:51.205 --> 54:52.705
Well, that's only four months.

54:52.790 --> 54:54.916
So you see, you got to
come back with me, Lula Mae.

54:55.000 --> 54:57.251
Your place is with me and your children
and your brother.

54:57.336 --> 54:59.754
Doc, you've got to understand.
I can't come back.

54:59.838 --> 55:02.256
And you got to understand
what I'm trying to tell you.

55:02.341 --> 55:05.218
Now, I don't want to seem like I'm
pressuring you none, but now I got to.

55:05.302 --> 55:06.636
If you don't come back with me,

55:06.720 --> 55:08.721
I'm gonna have to write young Fred
and tell him that

55:08.806 --> 55:11.474
unless he wants to look out for hisself,
he better sign up for another hitch.

55:11.558 --> 55:14.102
Doc, don't you do that.
Don't write that to him.

55:14.186 --> 55:16.729
I'll write him myself and tell him
I want him here with me.

55:16.855 --> 55:18.356
I'll take care of him . Don't you worry.

55:18.440 --> 55:19.941
You're talking crazy, Lula Mae.

55:20.025 --> 55:23.361
Doc, stop calling me that.
I'm not Lula Mae any more.

55:30.327 --> 55:32.036
All right, Lula Mae.

55:33.163 --> 55:35.456
I guess you know what you're doing.

55:44.758 --> 55:46.926
Keep an eye on her, will you, son?

55:47.302 --> 55:50.346
At least see she eats something
once in a while.

55:50.764 --> 55:51.931
Sure, Doc.

55:54.268 --> 55:56.519
So skinny.

56:14.913 --> 56:17.665
Please, Doc. Please understand.

56:18.584 --> 56:21.586
I love you,
but I'm just not Lula Mae any more.

56:25.340 --> 56:26.591
I'm not.

57:04.129 --> 57:06.297
You know the terrible thing,
Fred, darling?

57:06.381 --> 57:08.091
I am still Lula Mae.

57:08.175 --> 57:12.303
Fourteen years old, stealing turkey eggs
and running through a briar patch.

57:16.475 --> 57:18.976
But now I call it having the mean reds.

57:26.527 --> 57:29.403
Well, it's still too early
to go to Tiffany's.

57:29.905 --> 57:31.989
I guess the next best thing is a drink.

57:32.991 --> 57:35.159
Yes, I very much need a drink.

57:35.869 --> 57:38.538
- Will you buy me one, Fred, darling?
- Sure.

57:40.374 --> 57:44.168
Only promise me one thing.
Don't take me home until I'm drunk.

57:46.713 --> 57:48.714
Until I'm very drunk indeed.

58:23.792 --> 58:26.252
Do you think she's talented?

58:26.461 --> 58:30.214
- Deeply and importantly talented?
- No.

58:30.966 --> 58:33.426
Amusingly and superficially talented,
yes,

58:33.552 --> 58:37.388
but deeply and importantly, no.

58:59.786 --> 59:00.953
Gracious.

59:01.955 --> 59:04.790
Do you think she's handsomely paid?

59:08.754 --> 59:11.088
Oh, indeed.

59:11.798 --> 59:14.342
Well, let me tell you something, mister.

59:14.426 --> 59:17.762
If I had her money,
I'd be richer than she is.

59:17.846 --> 59:21.265
- How do you figure that?
- Because I'd keep the candy store.

59:21.767 --> 59:24.977
Old Sally Tomato.
That's my candy store.

59:25.103 --> 59:27.313
I'd always keep Sally.

59:27.439 --> 59:30.149
And that's why I'd be richer than she is.

59:32.778 --> 59:35.112
We'd better get a little more air.

59:44.122 --> 59:47.375
Tom, Dick, and Harry. No. Correction.

59:47.459 --> 59:51.003
Every Tom, Dick and Sid,
Harry was his friend.

59:51.964 --> 59:56.384
Anyway, every Tom, Dick and Sid
thinks that if he takes a girl to dinner,

59:56.468 --> 01:00:01.013
she'll just curl up like a kitten
in a little furry ball at his feet, right?

01:00:01.515 --> 01:00:04.100
I have by actual count
been taken to dinner

01:00:04.184 --> 01:00:07.311
by 26 different rats
in the last two months.

01:00:08.230 --> 01:00:10.439
Twenty-seven, if you count
Benny Shacklett,

01:00:10.524 --> 01:00:12.650
who is in many ways a super-rat.

01:00:12.734 --> 01:00:16.320
- I think I forgot my key.
- Never mind . I just buzzed Yunioshi.

01:00:17.656 --> 01:00:19.573
Do you wanna know something funny?

01:00:19.658 --> 01:00:22.868
In spite of the fact that
most of these rats fork up

01:00:22.995 --> 01:00:25.746
$50 for the powder room
like little dolls,

01:00:26.373 --> 01:00:31.002
I find I have again by actual count
$9 less in the old bank account

01:00:31.086 --> 01:00:32.837
than I had six months ago.

01:00:34.381 --> 01:00:36.590
So, my darling Fred,

01:00:36.675 --> 01:00:39.677
I have tonight
made a very serious decision.

01:00:39.761 --> 01:00:41.095
And what is that?

01:00:42.514 --> 01:00:45.391
No longer will I play the field.

01:00:45.517 --> 01:00:48.019
- Congratulations.
- The field stinks,

01:00:48.103 --> 01:00:50.521
both economically and socially.

01:00:51.440 --> 01:00:53.190
And I'm giving it up.

01:00:54.401 --> 01:00:57.611
Miss Golightly, this time
I'm not only calling the police,

01:00:57.696 --> 01:01:00.906
but the fire department and the
New York State Housing Commission,

01:01:01.033 --> 01:01:03.409
and, if necessary, the Board of Health!

01:01:03.535 --> 01:01:06.370
Quiet up there.
You want to wake the whole house?

01:01:08.206 --> 01:01:12.209
As Miss Golightly was saying
before she was so rudely interrupted,

01:01:13.628 --> 01:01:16.547
Miss Golightly further announces
her intention

01:01:17.090 --> 01:01:19.759
to devote
her many considerable talents

01:01:20.052 --> 01:01:23.220
to the immediate capture,
for the purpose of matrimony

01:01:24.056 --> 01:01:26.390
of Mr Rutherford.

01:01:27.476 --> 01:01:31.437
Rusty to his friends,
of whom I'm sure he has many.

01:01:32.105 --> 01:01:34.440
- Trawler.
- Who?

01:01:35.734 --> 01:01:39.612
Rusty Trawler. You met him at my party
a couple of weeks ago.

01:01:39.738 --> 01:01:41.822
He came with Mag Wildwood.

01:01:41.907 --> 01:01:44.617
Not the beautiful Latin type.

01:01:44.743 --> 01:01:47.244
The other one,
the one that looks like a pig.

01:01:48.747 --> 01:01:49.789
Remember?

01:01:49.915 --> 01:01:53.626
The ninth-richest man in America
under 50?

01:01:58.131 --> 01:02:01.092
Do I detect a look of disapproval
in your eye?

01:02:02.969 --> 01:02:06.597
Tough beans, buddy,
'cause that's the way it's gonna be.

01:02:06.681 --> 01:02:08.307
Hi, cat.

01:02:08.433 --> 01:02:10.476
Holly, you're drunk.

01:02:11.520 --> 01:02:12.603
True.

01:02:13.647 --> 01:02:17.608
- Absolutely true. True, but irrelevant.
- What are you doing?

01:02:18.944 --> 01:02:20.903
So I think we should have a drink

01:02:20.987 --> 01:02:23.781
to the new Mrs Rusty Trawler.

01:02:24.616 --> 01:02:26.367
- Me.
- Hey, take it easy.

01:02:27.828 --> 01:02:30.538
What's the matter,
don't you think I can do it?

01:02:31.164 --> 01:02:34.750
Tell me. Seriously, I'm interested.
Don't you think I can?

01:02:34.835 --> 01:02:36.293
You heard the Doc.

01:02:36.378 --> 01:02:38.504
My brother gets out of the army
in February

01:02:38.630 --> 01:02:41.715
and the Doc won't take him back.
So it's all up to me.

01:02:42.342 --> 01:02:44.677
I don't know why you don't understand.

01:02:45.470 --> 01:02:49.306
I need money, and I'll do whatever
I have to do to get it.

01:02:50.225 --> 01:02:51.308
So,

01:02:51.852 --> 01:02:56.147
this time next month,
I'll be the new Mrs Rusty Trawler.

01:02:58.191 --> 01:03:01.026
And I think we should have
a little drink to that.

01:03:01.361 --> 01:03:04.363
It's all gone. Isn't that too bad?

01:03:07.159 --> 01:03:09.034
Got any whisky upstairs?

01:03:10.412 --> 01:03:13.914
- But you've had enough.
- Go ahead . Get the whisky.

01:03:14.583 --> 01:03:16.667
I'll pay you for it.

01:03:19.337 --> 01:03:22.840
- Holly, please.
- No, no, you disapprove of me

01:03:23.216 --> 01:03:26.760
and I do not accept drinks
from gentlemen who disapprove of me.

01:03:27.721 --> 01:03:30.681
I'll pay for my own whisky
and don't you forget it.

01:03:30.765 --> 01:03:31.891
Holly.

01:03:32.017 --> 01:03:35.186
I do not accept drinks
from disapproving gentlemen.

01:03:35.729 --> 01:03:39.732
Especially not disapproving gentlemen
who are kept by other ladies.

01:03:40.525 --> 01:03:41.692
So take it.

01:03:42.903 --> 01:03:46.113
You should be used to taking money
from ladies by now.

01:03:52.204 --> 01:03:54.955
If I were you, I'd be more careful
with my money.

01:03:55.582 --> 01:03:58.209
Rusty Trawler is too hard a way
of earning it.

01:04:01.296 --> 01:04:06.133
It should take you exactly four seconds
to cross from here to that door.

01:04:07.552 --> 01:04:08.928
I'll give you two.

01:05:25.130 --> 01:05:26.171
Hi.

01:05:26.548 --> 01:05:28.716
I've come up to talk to you
about the other night,

01:05:28.800 --> 01:05:30.676
then I saw the paper, and...

01:05:31.386 --> 01:05:35.139
Well, actually,
I'm kind of embarrassed about it,

01:05:35.640 --> 01:05:39.727
but since it concerns you, I thought
I ought to talk to you about it in person.

01:05:39.811 --> 01:05:42.563
What?

01:05:44.983 --> 01:05:46.317
The earplugs.

01:05:47.193 --> 01:05:49.111
I can't go through the whole thing again.

01:05:49.195 --> 01:05:51.780
It's sufficient to say,
I've come to make up.

01:05:51.865 --> 01:05:54.825
And as an added inducement,
I have all kinds of news.

01:05:54.909 --> 01:05:56.160
Can I come in?

01:05:57.829 --> 01:06:01.248
I guess so. Just a minute.
Do I have a nightgown on?

01:06:02.042 --> 01:06:04.793
No, I don't. Would you mind
turning around for a second?

01:06:04.878 --> 01:06:07.379
Oh, never mind.
It's such a corny line anyway.

01:06:07.505 --> 01:06:09.173
I'll turn around myself.

01:06:09.424 --> 01:06:10.549
Come in.

01:06:12.093 --> 01:06:14.428
Have you seen the paper?

01:06:16.723 --> 01:06:18.098
Rusty, you mean?

01:06:18.767 --> 01:06:20.517
Yes. I know all about it.

01:06:20.852 --> 01:06:23.937
Certainly had him pegged wrong,
didn't I?

01:06:24.856 --> 01:06:28.942
I thought he was just a rat,
but he was a super-rat all along.

01:06:29.861 --> 01:06:32.029
A super-rat in rat's clothing.

01:06:32.530 --> 01:06:34.698
You don't even know the best part.

01:06:35.033 --> 01:06:37.618
Not only was he a rat,
or a super-rat, rather,

01:06:37.702 --> 01:06:39.495
he was also broke.

01:06:40.455 --> 01:06:43.207
Broke. I mean, but not a farthing.

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:47.294
His family has money, of course,
but he personally is broke.

01:06:47.420 --> 01:06:50.714
It turns out he owes $700, 000.

01:06:51.383 --> 01:06:54.468
Can you imagine
anyone owing $700, 000?

01:06:55.470 --> 01:06:56.804
$43, yes.

01:06:57.972 --> 01:07:01.809
Anyway, that's why he decided
to marry the queen of the pig people.

01:07:03.269 --> 01:07:05.729
I'll tell you one thing, Fred, darling,

01:07:06.106 --> 01:07:08.482
I'd marry you for your money
in a minute.

01:07:08.775 --> 01:07:11.735
- Would you marry me for my money?
- In a minute.

01:07:13.154 --> 01:07:16.323
So I guess it's pretty lucky
neither of us is rich?

01:07:16.574 --> 01:07:17.616
Yeah.

01:07:19.703 --> 01:07:21.995
Fred, darling, I'm so glad to see you.

01:07:27.210 --> 01:07:29.002
What have you been doing?

01:07:30.714 --> 01:07:32.089
Writing, mostly.

01:07:34.509 --> 01:07:37.136
Sold a story. Just got word this morning.

01:07:37.345 --> 01:07:40.848
Oh, that's marvelous. It really is.

01:07:42.350 --> 01:07:43.475
But...

01:07:43.560 --> 01:07:45.644
Only how does your decorator friend
feel about it?

01:07:45.729 --> 01:07:48.939
I thought you were supposed to be
saving yourself and all of that?

01:07:49.023 --> 01:07:50.357
You know something?

01:07:50.442 --> 01:07:53.193
I haven't got around to telling her
about it yet.

01:07:53.695 --> 01:07:55.612
Look, why don't we go out
and have a drink

01:07:55.697 --> 01:07:57.531
or take a walk or something
to celebrate?

01:07:57.615 --> 01:07:58.699
All right.

01:07:58.783 --> 01:08:00.868
I think there's some champagne
in the icebox.

01:08:00.952 --> 01:08:02.703
Why don't you open it
while I get dressed?

01:08:02.787 --> 01:08:03.829
Okay.

01:08:04.748 --> 01:08:08.292
I don't think I've ever drunk champagne
before breakfast before.

01:08:09.461 --> 01:08:11.670
With breakfast on several occasions.

01:08:12.046 --> 01:08:13.589
But never before, before.

01:08:13.673 --> 01:08:15.841
Now I've got a wonderful idea.

01:08:15.925 --> 01:08:18.385
We can spend a whole day doing things
we've never done before.

01:08:18.470 --> 01:08:21.930
We'll take turns. First something
you've never done, then me.

01:08:22.432 --> 01:08:25.725
Of course, I can't really think of anything
I've never done.

01:08:42.327 --> 01:08:44.578
I've never been for a walk
in the morning before.

01:08:44.662 --> 01:08:46.705
At least not since I've been in New York.

01:08:46.790 --> 01:08:48.290
I've walked up Fifth Avenue at 6: 00,

01:08:48.374 --> 01:08:50.250
but as far as I'm concerned,
that's still night.

01:08:50.335 --> 01:08:53.587
- Do you think it counts?
- Sure it counts. Now we're even.

01:09:07.100 --> 01:09:09.853
- Don't you just love it?
- Love what?

01:09:10.188 --> 01:09:11.479
Tiffany's.

01:09:21.950 --> 01:09:23.575
Isn't it wonderful?

01:09:23.868 --> 01:09:26.078
You see what I mean how nothing bad
could ever happen to you

01:09:26.162 --> 01:09:27.287
in a place like this?

01:09:27.372 --> 01:09:31.166
It isn't that I give a hoot about
jewelery, except diamonds, of course.

01:09:32.126 --> 01:09:33.627
Like that.

01:09:40.176 --> 01:09:41.593
What do you think?

01:09:42.261 --> 01:09:43.470
Well...

01:09:45.682 --> 01:09:49.852
Of course, personally, I think it would be
tacky to wear diamonds before I'm 40.

01:09:49.935 --> 01:09:53.272
Well, you're right. But in the meantime,
you should have something.

01:09:53.356 --> 01:09:54.773
I'll wait.

01:09:54.858 --> 01:09:57.067
No. I'm gonna buy you a present.

01:09:57.360 --> 01:10:00.028
You bought me one, a typewriter ribbon,
and it brought me luck.

01:10:00.113 --> 01:10:02.197
All right, but Tiffany's can be
pretty expensive.

01:10:02.282 --> 01:10:04.825
I've got my cheque and $ 10.

01:10:04.909 --> 01:10:07.202
Oh, I wouldn't let you cash your cheque.

01:10:07.287 --> 01:10:10.706
But a present for $ 10 or under,
that I'll accept.

01:10:11.457 --> 01:10:15.335
Of course, I don't exactly know what
we're going to find at Tiffany's for $ 10.

01:10:25.054 --> 01:10:26.388
May I help you?

01:10:26.848 --> 01:10:29.766
Perhaps. Actually, we were looking
for a present for the lady.

01:10:29.851 --> 01:10:31.018
Certainly, sir.

01:10:31.102 --> 01:10:33.562
Is there something special
you had in mind?

01:10:34.397 --> 01:10:36.481
Well, we had considered diamonds.

01:10:37.108 --> 01:10:38.442
Now, I don't want to offend you,

01:10:38.526 --> 01:10:41.361
but the lady feels
that diamonds are tacky for her.

01:10:42.947 --> 01:10:45.407
Oh, I think they're divine
on older women,

01:10:45.491 --> 01:10:47.910
but I don't think they'd be right for me.
You do understand?

01:10:47.994 --> 01:10:49.036
Certainly.

01:10:49.120 --> 01:10:53.498
In all fairness, I think I ought to explain.
There's also a secondary problem.

01:10:53.583 --> 01:10:54.666
One of finance.

01:10:54.751 --> 01:10:58.128
We can only afford to spend
a limited amount.

01:10:58.630 --> 01:11:01.506
- May I ask how limited?
- $ 10.

01:11:03.092 --> 01:11:04.217
$ 10?

01:11:04.928 --> 01:11:07.054
That was the outside figure, yes.

01:11:07.388 --> 01:11:08.430
I see.

01:11:08.973 --> 01:11:10.766
Do you have anything for $ 10?

01:11:10.850 --> 01:11:12.935
Well, frankly, madam,
within that price range,

01:11:13.019 --> 01:11:15.812
the variety of merchandise
is rather limited.

01:11:15.897 --> 01:11:18.815
However, I do think we might have,
let me see...

01:11:19.317 --> 01:11:21.610
Strictly as a novelty, you understand.

01:11:21.778 --> 01:11:24.488
For the lady and gentleman
who has everything,

01:11:24.989 --> 01:11:27.449
a sterling silver telephone dialer

01:11:28.034 --> 01:11:30.619
at $6.75, including tax.

01:11:30.703 --> 01:11:33.246
A sterling silver telephone dialer.

01:11:33.331 --> 01:11:37.250
Yes, sir. At $6.75, including federal tax.

01:11:37.335 --> 01:11:40.545
Well, the price is right, but I must say,

01:11:40.630 --> 01:11:44.424
I'd rather hoped for something
slightly more, how shall I say it,

01:11:44.759 --> 01:11:46.259
romantic in feeling.

01:11:46.761 --> 01:11:47.886
What do you think?

01:11:47.971 --> 01:11:50.013
As sterling silver telephone dialers go,

01:11:50.098 --> 01:11:53.642
I certainly think it's handsome,
but, well, you do understand?

01:11:54.727 --> 01:11:56.728
Well, we tried, but I guess...

01:11:57.313 --> 01:11:59.648
We could have something engraved,
couldn't we?

01:11:59.732 --> 01:12:01.149
Yes, I suppose so.

01:12:01.609 --> 01:12:02.734
Yes, indeed.

01:12:03.152 --> 01:12:06.446
The only problem is, you would more
or less have to buy something first

01:12:06.531 --> 01:12:10.575
if only in order to have some object
upon which to place the engraving.

01:12:11.285 --> 01:12:12.911
You see the difficulty.

01:12:13.496 --> 01:12:14.579
Well...

01:12:15.081 --> 01:12:17.040
We could have this engraved,
couldn't we?

01:12:17.125 --> 01:12:19.126
I think it would be very smart.

01:12:20.628 --> 01:12:23.797
This, I take it, was not
purchased at Tiffany's?

01:12:23.881 --> 01:12:24.965
No.

01:12:25.049 --> 01:12:27.801
Actually, it was purchased
concurrent with...

01:12:27.885 --> 01:12:30.512
Well, actually, it came inside of...

01:12:31.597 --> 01:12:33.432
well, a box of Cracker Jack.

01:12:33.850 --> 01:12:34.891
I see.

01:12:36.519 --> 01:12:39.980
Do they still really have prizes
in Cracker Jack boxes?

01:12:40.189 --> 01:12:42.399
- Oh, yes.
- That's nice to know.

01:12:44.318 --> 01:12:46.695
It gives one a feeling of solidarity,

01:12:47.196 --> 01:12:50.365
almost of continuity with the past,
that sort of thing.

01:12:50.450 --> 01:12:52.826
Do you think Tiffany's
would really engrave it for us?

01:12:52.910 --> 01:12:54.786
I mean, you don't think
they would feel it was beneath them

01:12:54.871 --> 01:12:56.038
or anything like that?

01:12:56.122 --> 01:12:58.248
Well, it is rather unusual, madam.

01:12:58.833 --> 01:13:02.335
But I think you'll find that Tiffany's
is very understanding.

01:13:02.420 --> 01:13:04.421
If you would tell me what initials
you would like,

01:13:04.505 --> 01:13:07.883
I think we could have something
ready for you in the morning.

01:13:10.011 --> 01:13:12.512
Didn't I tell you this was a lovely place?

01:13:34.368 --> 01:13:36.119
What is this place, anyway?

01:13:36.204 --> 01:13:39.039
You said you wanted to sit down.
It's the public library.

01:13:39.123 --> 01:13:42.375
- You've never been here?
- No. That makes two for me.

01:13:42.919 --> 01:13:45.378
- I don't see any books.
- They're in there.

01:13:50.259 --> 01:13:51.343
See?

01:13:56.140 --> 01:13:59.518
Each one of these little drawers
is stuffed with little cards.

01:13:59.602 --> 01:14:02.813
And each little card is
a book or an author.

01:14:02.897 --> 01:14:04.689
I think that's fascinating.

01:14:05.149 --> 01:14:07.359
V-A-R-J-A-K.

01:14:07.693 --> 01:14:08.819
Really?

01:14:11.280 --> 01:14:14.282
Look. Isn't it marvelous?

01:14:14.367 --> 01:14:17.202
There you are, right in the public library.

01:14:17.537 --> 01:14:20.163
"Varjak, Paul . Nine Lives."

01:14:20.790 --> 01:14:22.290
And then a lot of numbers.

01:14:22.375 --> 01:14:24.960
Do you think they really have
the book itself, live?

01:14:25.044 --> 01:14:27.129
Sure. Follow me.

01:14:36.806 --> 01:14:38.974
Number 57. That's us.

01:14:40.226 --> 01:14:43.145
Fifty-seven, please.
Nine Lives by Varjak, Paul.

01:14:44.313 --> 01:14:46.106
Did you ever read it?
It's absolutely marvelous.

01:14:46.190 --> 01:14:49.568
- No, I'm afraid I haven't.
- Well, you should . He wrote it.

01:14:49.986 --> 01:14:51.987
He's Varjak, Paul, in person.

01:14:52.738 --> 01:14:54.364
She doesn't believe me.

01:14:54.657 --> 01:14:58.368
Show her your driver's license
or Diner's Club card or something.

01:14:58.828 --> 01:15:01.913
Honest, he really is the author.
Cross my heart and kiss my elbow.

01:15:01.998 --> 01:15:04.082
Would you kindly
lower your voice, miss?

01:15:04.167 --> 01:15:05.876
Why don't you autograph it to them?

01:15:05.960 --> 01:15:08.378
Don't you think it'd be nice?
Sort of make it more personal?

01:15:08.462 --> 01:15:09.838
Really, miss...

01:15:10.173 --> 01:15:13.133
Go ahead . Don't be so stuck up,
autograph it to them.

01:15:13.217 --> 01:15:15.051
All right, what shall I say?

01:15:15.678 --> 01:15:17.679
Something sentimental, I think.

01:15:18.389 --> 01:15:20.348
What are you doing? Stop that!

01:15:20.683 --> 01:15:24.477
- You're defacing public property.
- Well, all right, if that's the way you feel.

01:15:24.562 --> 01:15:26.813
Come on, Fred, darling.
Let's get out of here.

01:15:26.898 --> 01:15:29.649
I don't think
this place is half as nice as Tiffany's.

01:15:43.873 --> 01:15:46.333
Hey, did you ever steal anything
from a five-and-ten

01:15:46.417 --> 01:15:47.834
when you were a kid, I mean?

01:15:47.919 --> 01:15:51.504
No. I'm the sensitive, bookish type.
Did you?

01:15:51.589 --> 01:15:55.508
I used to. I still do every now and then,
sort of to keep my hand in.

01:15:55.593 --> 01:15:57.344
Come on . Don't be chicken.

01:15:57.428 --> 01:16:00.263
Anyway, you've never done it,
and it's your turn.

01:18:49.934 --> 01:18:51.267
I can't see.

01:20:24.361 --> 01:20:25.528
Hi, cat.

01:20:26.030 --> 01:20:27.739
Lady of the house at home?

01:20:29.575 --> 01:20:33.244
Holly?

01:21:00.064 --> 01:21:01.356
Trick or treat.

01:21:02.733 --> 01:21:06.694
You're crazy. You know that, don't you?
But I love you anyway.

01:21:07.196 --> 01:21:09.072
- 2-E.
- Yeah?

01:21:10.032 --> 01:21:12.742
I've got to talk to you.

01:21:13.744 --> 01:21:14.869
All right.

01:21:19.959 --> 01:21:21.376
You want a drink?

01:21:27.591 --> 01:21:29.842
If this is going to be
a serious discussion

01:21:29.927 --> 01:21:32.428
and suddenly I'm terribly afraid it is,

01:21:32.721 --> 01:21:35.598
you're going to have to take off
that ridiculous mask

01:21:35.724 --> 01:21:38.226
or else I'm going to have to
wear one, too.

01:21:38.769 --> 01:21:40.937
2-E, look, please.

01:21:46.777 --> 01:21:49.487
What's the matter? Girl trouble?

01:21:51.115 --> 01:21:52.615
Is that it, darling?

01:21:54.493 --> 01:21:56.286
Oh, I see.

01:21:58.956 --> 01:22:00.790
Well, that's not so serious.

01:22:01.792 --> 01:22:04.002
As a matter of fact,
I've been expecting it.

01:22:04.128 --> 01:22:06.963
I can't say I like it,
but I've been expecting it.

01:22:08.507 --> 01:22:11.301
- Who is she?
- Hasn't got anything to do with her.

01:22:14.305 --> 01:22:16.139
This is between you and me.

01:22:16.682 --> 01:22:18.141
Then it is serious.

01:22:19.643 --> 01:22:20.810
Well, now.

01:22:20.936 --> 01:22:22.979
2-E, you're a very stylish girl.

01:22:24.440 --> 01:22:26.274
Can't we end this stylishly?

01:22:28.152 --> 01:22:30.320
- End it?
- Yes.

01:22:32.448 --> 01:22:33.489
Well...

01:22:36.994 --> 01:22:40.830
I do believe love has found Andy Hardy.

01:22:42.166 --> 01:22:43.333
Let's see,

01:22:43.667 --> 01:22:44.792
a waitress?

01:22:45.628 --> 01:22:46.794
A salesgirl?

01:22:47.171 --> 01:22:50.340
No. She'd have to be someone rich,
wouldn't she, Paul?

01:22:51.884 --> 01:22:53.676
Someone who could help you.

01:22:54.345 --> 01:22:55.845
Curiously enough,

01:22:59.183 --> 01:23:02.143
she's a girl who can't help anyone,
not even herself.

01:23:03.145 --> 01:23:07.357
Thing is, I can help her,
and it's a nice feeling for a change.

01:23:10.194 --> 01:23:11.194
All right.

01:23:12.571 --> 01:23:14.238
I understand.

01:23:17.534 --> 01:23:19.327
I'll tell you what, Paul.

01:23:19.703 --> 01:23:22.163
I am a very stylish girl.

01:23:22.247 --> 01:23:24.874
- What are you doing?
- Writing a cheque.

01:23:27.920 --> 01:23:29.587
Don't look so bewildered.

01:23:29.713 --> 01:23:32.382
Surely you've noticed me
writing cheques before.

01:23:32.716 --> 01:23:36.052
"Pay to the order
of Paul Varjak, $ 1, 000."

01:23:37.221 --> 01:23:39.389
Take her away somewhere for a week.

01:23:41.225 --> 01:23:43.601
You're entitled to a vacation with pay.

01:23:43.936 --> 01:23:46.688
Simply a matter of fair labor practice,
darling.

01:23:46.772 --> 01:23:48.106
Of course, if you were really smart,

01:23:48.232 --> 01:23:51.025
you'd get some of the other boys
together and organize a union.

01:23:51.110 --> 01:23:53.736
That way you'd get
all the fringe benefits,

01:23:53.821 --> 01:23:56.239
hospitalization, a pension plan

01:23:56.740 --> 01:23:59.117
and unemployment insurance
when you're,

01:24:00.285 --> 01:24:03.246
how shall I put it,
between engagements?

01:24:07.501 --> 01:24:09.669
Thanks for making it easier for me.

01:24:10.921 --> 01:24:12.797
Don't be ridiculous, darling.

01:24:13.590 --> 01:24:14.924
Take the cheque.

01:24:15.342 --> 01:24:16.801
And call your girl.

01:24:17.094 --> 01:24:18.177
No, thanks.

01:24:19.263 --> 01:24:21.097
I've got a cheque of my own.

01:24:23.267 --> 01:24:25.852
When you get yourself
a new writer to help,

01:24:26.353 --> 01:24:28.187
try and find one my size.

01:24:28.981 --> 01:24:31.983
That way you won't have to even
shorten the sleeves.

01:25:24.328 --> 01:25:25.928
Holly!

01:25:33.504 --> 01:25:35.129
Hey.

01:25:35.214 --> 01:25:37.215
- What are you doing?
- Excuse me.

01:25:39.009 --> 01:25:40.092
I'm sorry.

01:25:40.177 --> 01:25:42.887
You look just like a girl I know
named Holly.

01:25:43.013 --> 01:25:44.013
Really?

01:25:46.099 --> 01:25:47.183
I'm sorry.

01:26:16.588 --> 01:26:17.713
Hi.

01:26:25.889 --> 01:26:27.223
What do you want?

01:26:28.725 --> 01:26:30.309
I want to talk to you.

01:26:31.728 --> 01:26:32.979
I'm busy.

01:26:35.899 --> 01:26:37.942
- What are you doing?
- Reading.

01:26:39.152 --> 01:26:41.946
"South America:
Land of Wealth and Promise"?

01:26:43.240 --> 01:26:44.782
It's very interesting.

01:26:46.577 --> 01:26:48.244
Let's get out of here.

01:26:50.122 --> 01:26:53.082
I said let's get out of here.
I want to talk to you.

01:26:56.253 --> 01:26:59.088
What's the matter with you, anyway?
What's happened?

01:27:00.632 --> 01:27:03.259
Fred, will you please
just leave me alone?

01:27:04.094 --> 01:27:05.136
Holly,

01:27:06.096 --> 01:27:07.263
I love you.

01:27:14.438 --> 01:27:16.939
- Where are you going?
- To the ladies' room.

01:27:20.027 --> 01:27:21.903
- What's the matter with you, anyway?
- Let me go.

01:27:21.987 --> 01:27:23.863
- No.
- Fred, please let me go.

01:27:23.947 --> 01:27:25.281
Let's get something straight.

01:27:25.365 --> 01:27:27.950
I am not now,
nor have I ever been, Fred.

01:27:28.035 --> 01:27:29.994
Nor am I Benny Shacklett,
whoever he may be.

01:27:30.120 --> 01:27:33.080
My name is Paul, Paul Varjak,
and I love you.

01:27:33.165 --> 01:27:34.832
- Let me go.
- Not till we get this settled.

01:27:34.958 --> 01:27:37.460
Now what's all this jazz
about South America?

01:27:38.337 --> 01:27:40.296
I thought if I'm going to marry
a South American,

01:27:40.380 --> 01:27:42.840
I'd better find out something
about the country.

01:27:42.966 --> 01:27:45.718
- Marry? What South American?
- José.

01:27:45.969 --> 01:27:48.471
- Who the hell is José?
- José da Silva Pereira.

01:27:48.555 --> 01:27:50.264
Who the hell's José da Silva Pereira?

01:27:50.349 --> 01:27:53.351
Darling, you met him . I know you did.
Mag Wildwood's friend.

01:27:53.477 --> 01:27:56.312
The tall, good-looking one
who came to the party with Rusty?

01:27:56.396 --> 01:27:58.189
Well, my dear, you won't believe this,

01:27:58.273 --> 01:28:01.567
but it turns out not only is he handsome
and wildly rich,

01:28:01.652 --> 01:28:03.569
he's absolutely cuckoo for me.

01:28:04.446 --> 01:28:06.864
- You're crazy.
- What? Do you think you own me?

01:28:06.949 --> 01:28:08.366
That's exactly what I think.

01:28:08.450 --> 01:28:10.159
I know, I know.
That's what everybody always thinks,

01:28:10.243 --> 01:28:11.702
but everybody happens to be wrong.

01:28:11.787 --> 01:28:13.496
Look, I am not everybody.

01:28:15.958 --> 01:28:17.166
Or am I?

01:28:19.252 --> 01:28:21.170
Is that what you really think?

01:28:22.297 --> 01:28:25.883
That I'm no different from
all your other rats and super-rats?

01:28:26.885 --> 01:28:28.177
Wait a minute.

01:28:28.971 --> 01:28:30.346
If that's it,

01:28:32.140 --> 01:28:34.266
if that's what you really think,

01:28:35.477 --> 01:28:37.728
there's something I want to give you.

01:28:41.233 --> 01:28:42.483
What's that?

01:28:43.276 --> 01:28:44.986
$50 for the powder room.

01:29:18.020 --> 01:29:20.271
I wouldn't ask you in,
except the place is in such a mess

01:29:20.355 --> 01:29:23.024
- I couldn't bear to face it alone.
- You have a message.

01:29:23.233 --> 01:29:24.316
No.

01:29:28.071 --> 01:29:29.113
Olé.

01:29:46.590 --> 01:29:48.382
Good evening, Mr Yunioshi.

01:29:51.928 --> 01:29:53.429
Good evening, Paul.

01:29:53.805 --> 01:29:58.100
Good evening.

01:30:13.575 --> 01:30:15.284
Please, you must help me.

01:30:22.834 --> 01:30:23.876
Holly.

01:30:24.211 --> 01:30:26.504
Holly. Holly.

01:30:32.135 --> 01:30:33.177
Holly.

01:30:33.261 --> 01:30:35.137
- Holly. Holly.
- Let me go. No!

01:30:35.222 --> 01:30:36.639
Holly.

01:30:36.848 --> 01:30:38.891
- Holly.
- Fred . Fred.

01:30:40.227 --> 01:30:41.268
Holly.

01:31:01.248 --> 01:31:02.998
No, no.

01:31:10.549 --> 01:31:12.149
Fred.

01:31:24.312 --> 01:31:26.397
- What did you do to her?
- Nothing.

01:31:26.731 --> 01:31:28.691
There was a telegram, and then this.

01:31:28.775 --> 01:31:32.027
Crashing everything, conducting
like a crazy. It's appalling.

01:31:32.112 --> 01:31:35.197
I can't have a public scandal.
It's too delicate.

01:31:35.282 --> 01:31:37.283
My name, my position, my family.

01:31:37.826 --> 01:31:39.535
Will there be the police again,
do you think?

01:31:39.619 --> 01:31:42.955
I don't see why. There's no law against
busting up your own apartment.

01:31:43.039 --> 01:31:45.207
- Where is the telegram?
- There it is.

01:31:53.049 --> 01:31:55.342
"Received notice. Young Fred killed"

01:31:59.055 --> 01:32:01.557
"in jeep accident, Fort Riley, Kansas."

01:32:02.809 --> 01:32:06.562
"Your husband and children
join in the sorrow of our mutual loss."

01:32:08.565 --> 01:32:10.691
"Letter following . Love, Doc."

01:32:12.819 --> 01:32:14.236
Her brother Fred.

01:32:16.990 --> 01:32:18.908
This brother,
was she very close to him?

01:32:18.992 --> 01:32:20.075
Yeah.

01:32:23.788 --> 01:32:25.247
What can one do?

01:32:26.166 --> 01:32:27.541
Try to help her.

01:32:27.959 --> 01:32:30.002
I tried . It didn't do much good.

01:32:32.130 --> 01:32:34.423
You got a ranch or something
down in Brazil, don't you?

01:32:34.507 --> 01:32:35.549
Yes.

01:32:36.801 --> 01:32:38.761
That's good . She'll like that.

01:32:41.640 --> 01:32:43.766
Well, you better get in there.

01:34:12.480 --> 01:34:14.231
- Hi.
- Hello.

01:34:14.733 --> 01:34:17.359
Got your wire.
How did you know where to reach me?

01:34:17.444 --> 01:34:19.611
Oh, I tried everything.
Called people, asked around

01:34:19.696 --> 01:34:21.488
and suddenly thought of looking
in the phone book.

01:34:21.614 --> 01:34:23.615
Anyway, I'm glad you could come.

01:34:26.536 --> 01:34:28.162
- You look fine.
- You think so?

01:34:28.246 --> 01:34:30.581
I'm fat as a pig, and I haven't had
my hair done in months.

01:34:30.665 --> 01:34:33.625
But I'm happy, really happy.
It probably shows.

01:34:34.085 --> 01:34:36.295
You look très distingué yourself.

01:34:36.379 --> 01:34:38.172
I got a job. I've been writing a little.

01:34:38.256 --> 01:34:40.007
I know. I've read three of your stories.

01:34:40.091 --> 01:34:43.385
Two in The New Yorker
and one in that funny little magazine.

01:34:46.097 --> 01:34:47.598
Won't you sit down?

01:34:47.849 --> 01:34:48.932
Thank you.

01:34:49.517 --> 01:34:51.727
- I've taken up knitting.
- So I see.

01:34:53.313 --> 01:34:57.107
It'll probably look very nice
once it's finished.

01:34:57.192 --> 01:34:58.817
Actually, I'm a little nervous about it.

01:34:58.902 --> 01:35:01.820
José brought up the blueprints
for a new ranch house he's building

01:35:01.905 --> 01:35:02.946
and I have this strange feeling

01:35:03.031 --> 01:35:05.657
that maybe the blueprints and
my knitting instructions got switched.

01:35:05.742 --> 01:35:09.036
I mean, it isn't impossible
that I'm knitting a ranch house.

01:35:18.254 --> 01:35:21.465
Really, darling, I can't tell you
how divinely happy I am.

01:35:22.967 --> 01:35:24.468
What is that, anyhow?

01:35:24.928 --> 01:35:27.471
Portuguese.
A very complicated language.

01:35:27.555 --> 01:35:29.640
Four thousand irregular verbs.

01:35:36.648 --> 01:35:38.315
Very impressive. What's it mean?

01:35:38.400 --> 01:35:41.110
"I believe you are in league
with the butcher."

01:35:44.989 --> 01:35:46.740
Holly, what's this about?

01:35:48.493 --> 01:35:50.285
Why did you want to see me?

01:35:51.246 --> 01:35:52.788
José's in Washington for the night

01:35:52.872 --> 01:35:55.541
so I thought if I asked you over,
you might come.

01:35:55.625 --> 01:35:59.002
And, well, I've said goodbye
to everyone else I care about.

01:35:59.087 --> 01:36:00.504
You're going somewhere?

01:36:00.588 --> 01:36:01.922
I'm going to Rio tomorrow.

01:36:02.006 --> 01:36:04.800
I've got the plane ticket,
and I've even said goodbye to old Sally.

01:36:04.884 --> 01:36:06.135
José is flying down with you?

01:36:06.219 --> 01:36:08.011
We're going on separate planes,
of course.

01:36:08.096 --> 01:36:10.806
He doesn't think it would look right
for us to be traveling together.

01:36:10.890 --> 01:36:12.391
His family's very important down there,

01:36:12.475 --> 01:36:14.476
so he has to worry
about things like that.

01:36:14.561 --> 01:36:17.187
Anyway, I thought I'd show off
and cook dinner for us.

01:36:17.272 --> 01:36:18.856
It'll be fun eating in.

01:36:19.149 --> 01:36:22.192
Did I tell you how divinely
and utterly happy I am?

01:36:22.277 --> 01:36:23.402
Yes.

01:36:23.987 --> 01:36:25.904
You are getting married, then?

01:36:26.364 --> 01:36:29.658
Well, he hasn't really asked me,
not in so many words.

01:36:29.742 --> 01:36:30.993
Four, you mean?

01:36:32.954 --> 01:36:35.164
Well, that's how many words it takes.

01:36:35.331 --> 01:36:37.499
"Will you marry me?"

01:36:38.501 --> 01:36:40.669
Oh, we'll get married, all right.
I know we will.

01:36:40.795 --> 01:36:43.755
And in church and with his family there
and everything.

01:36:43.840 --> 01:36:47.009
And that's why he's waiting
till we get to Rio, probably.

01:36:49.846 --> 01:36:52.514
Do you think it's trying
to tell us something?

01:36:53.183 --> 01:36:56.518
I hope you like chicken and saffron rice
served with chocolate sauce.

01:36:56.644 --> 01:36:58.437
It's an East Indian classic, my dear.

01:36:58.521 --> 01:37:01.023
Three months ago,
I couldn't scramble eggs.

01:37:04.694 --> 01:37:06.111
Are you all right?

01:37:07.197 --> 01:37:10.365
Golly, darling.
I did so want to impress you.

01:37:10.492 --> 01:37:11.533
Look,

01:37:11.868 --> 01:37:14.786
I'm not much for chicken with sauce,
anyway.

01:37:14.871 --> 01:37:18.373
Why don't we go out somewhere?
Let me buy you a farewell dinner.

01:37:18.541 --> 01:37:22.127
That would be fun, as long as
it's someplace I can go like this.

01:37:30.053 --> 01:37:31.386
Years from now,

01:37:31.804 --> 01:37:34.389
years and years, I'll be back.

01:37:34.974 --> 01:37:37.392
Me and my nine Brazilian brats.

01:37:38.728 --> 01:37:41.313
They'll be dark like José, of course,

01:37:41.397 --> 01:37:44.233
but they'll have
bright, green, beautiful eyes.

01:37:46.528 --> 01:37:50.364
I'll bring them back, all right,
'cause they must see this.

01:37:51.574 --> 01:37:53.242
Oh, I love New York.

01:37:53.326 --> 01:37:56.537
Then why are you leaving?
What's in it for you, anyway?

01:37:58.581 --> 01:38:00.916
Look, I know what you're thinking,
and I don't blame you.

01:38:01.042 --> 01:38:03.752
I've always thrown out such a jazzy line.

01:38:04.546 --> 01:38:08.674
Really, except for Doc and yourself,
José's my first non-rat romance.

01:38:09.926 --> 01:38:12.427
Not that he's my idea
of the absolute finito.

01:38:13.096 --> 01:38:15.931
He's too prim and cautious
to be my absolute ideal.

01:38:17.559 --> 01:38:20.602
Now if I could choose
from anybody alive, I wouldn't pick José.

01:38:20.728 --> 01:38:22.854
Nehru, maybe, or Albert Schweitzer.

01:38:23.773 --> 01:38:25.274
Or Leonard Bernstein.

01:38:27.694 --> 01:38:29.361
But I am mad about José.

01:38:29.445 --> 01:38:32.281
I honestly think I'd give up smoking
if he asked me.

01:38:35.285 --> 01:38:38.120
Come on, darling, let's eat.
It's getting late.

01:38:39.956 --> 01:38:42.958
I'm leaving tomorrow,
and I haven't even begun to pack.

01:39:04.063 --> 01:39:07.399
Didn't want José to think I was
the kind of girl who loses her key,

01:39:07.483 --> 01:39:09.276
so I had 26 of them made.

01:39:10.153 --> 01:39:11.987
No, wait. I got a better idea.

01:39:12.071 --> 01:39:13.822
Kind of a farewell gesture.

01:39:15.908 --> 01:39:17.326
Somebody must have tripped the lock.

01:39:17.452 --> 01:39:19.995
Crafty devil, that Yunioshi.

01:39:20.121 --> 01:39:22.497
Wake up, wake up!
The British are coming!

01:39:22.582 --> 01:39:24.750
- Or, in this case, the Brazilians.
- Exactly.

01:39:24.834 --> 01:39:27.753
- Exactly.
- I've still got to clean up all that rice.

01:39:29.255 --> 01:39:30.631
Hey, you know...

01:39:30.798 --> 01:39:31.840
Hey!

01:39:33.676 --> 01:39:37.304
There she are who did it!
The wanted woman! There!

01:39:38.765 --> 01:39:40.766
Groenburger. Narcotics squad.

01:39:40.850 --> 01:39:43.685
- What do you mean?
- What's going on?

01:39:43.853 --> 01:39:45.437
- Why don't you ask your boss?
- What boss?

01:39:45.521 --> 01:39:48.106
Sally Tomato. Why don't you ask him?
Come on.

01:39:48.191 --> 01:39:52.152
Look around for narcotic.
They got plenty narcotic in there.

01:40:10.880 --> 01:40:13.048
- What's your name?
- Varjak.

01:40:13.132 --> 01:40:14.466
Hold it down over there!

01:40:14.550 --> 01:40:17.302
Paul Varjak. V-A-R-J-A-K.

01:40:17.387 --> 01:40:19.221
- Hey!
- Oh, get lost, will you?

01:40:19.347 --> 01:40:20.389
Get out!

01:40:21.015 --> 01:40:22.224
I'm a writer.

01:40:22.558 --> 01:40:24.685
W-R-I-T-E-R.

01:40:28.147 --> 01:40:32.984
- Please. One, one, please.
- One at a time. Please, one.

01:40:33.403 --> 01:40:34.569
Good.

01:40:35.738 --> 01:40:38.490
- Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
- I can't answer all your questions.

01:40:38.574 --> 01:40:41.076
- Just one at a time.
- Knock it off!

01:40:43.287 --> 01:40:44.788
Now, darling, why don't you start?

01:40:44.914 --> 01:40:46.957
Is it true you carried messages
from Tomato in code?

01:40:47.083 --> 01:40:48.166
Of course not.

01:40:48.251 --> 01:40:50.293
I'd just meet Mr O'Shaughnessy
at Hamburger Heaven

01:40:50.420 --> 01:40:51.503
and give him the weather report.

01:40:51.587 --> 01:40:54.089
Simply do not ask me what this is
all about.

01:40:55.091 --> 01:40:56.800
But you did used to visit Tomato?

01:40:56.926 --> 01:40:58.844
I used to see him every week.
What's wrong with that?

01:40:58.928 --> 01:41:01.179
Well, you must've known Tomato was
part of the narcotics syndicate.

01:41:01.264 --> 01:41:02.848
Mr Tomato never mentioned
narcotics to me.

01:41:02.932 --> 01:41:05.851
It makes me furious the way all these
wretched people keep persecuting him.

01:41:05.935 --> 01:41:07.936
He's a deeply sensitive person.

01:41:08.229 --> 01:41:10.480
- A darling old man.
- Then you're innocent.

01:41:10.606 --> 01:41:12.524
- Of course I'm innocent.
- What are you going to do about it?

01:41:12.608 --> 01:41:15.152
- What do you mean?
- Well, who's your lawyer?

01:41:15.445 --> 01:41:16.611
I don't know.

01:41:17.238 --> 01:41:18.989
Mr O'Shaughnessy, I guess.

01:41:19.949 --> 01:41:21.783
Mr O'Shaughnessy!

01:41:23.619 --> 01:41:25.162
Hey! Get out of here!

01:41:25.621 --> 01:41:27.622
- All right, come on.
- Okay, move.

01:41:27.749 --> 01:41:30.083
- Come on, then.
- Mr O'Shaughnessy?

01:41:30.168 --> 01:41:32.335
- Shut up!
- Get in there.

01:41:54.484 --> 01:41:56.693
- Yeah.
- Mr Paul Varjak?

01:41:56.819 --> 01:41:59.654
- Yeah.
- Ready with Mr Berman in Hollywood.

01:42:00.823 --> 01:42:03.825
Kindly deposit $3
for the first 3 minutes, please.

01:42:12.710 --> 01:42:16.171
Hello?

01:42:16.339 --> 01:42:18.507
O.J. Berman here. Who's calling?

01:42:19.217 --> 01:42:23.011
- Mr Berman, this is Paul Varjak.
- Nice to talk to you, kid.

01:42:23.346 --> 01:42:26.515
Varjak. V-A-R-J-A-K.

01:42:27.308 --> 01:42:29.893
I'm a friend of Holly's.
I met you at a party in New York.

01:42:30.019 --> 01:42:33.980
- Who?
- Paul. Paul Varjak.

01:42:34.315 --> 01:42:35.524
V-A-R...

01:42:37.235 --> 01:42:39.528
Mr Berman, this is Fred.

01:42:39.654 --> 01:42:41.571
Oh, Fred baby?

01:42:41.697 --> 01:42:43.907
So you're calling about the kid?

01:42:44.826 --> 01:42:47.536
Everything's under control . Just relax.

01:42:49.038 --> 01:42:51.081
I spoke to my lawyer in New York.

01:42:51.874 --> 01:42:53.917
I told him to take care of everything,
send me the bill

01:42:54.043 --> 01:42:55.418
but to keep my name anonymous.

01:42:55.753 --> 01:42:58.380
- What?
- Unknown. I don't want any part of it.

01:42:59.006 --> 01:43:01.925
- You hear me?
- You sound like you're in a tunnel.

01:43:03.094 --> 01:43:05.178
It's this executive phone I have.

01:43:05.263 --> 01:43:07.264
- What?
- Executive phone!

01:43:08.099 --> 01:43:10.767
Fred baby, they only got her
on $ 10, 000 bail.

01:43:10.893 --> 01:43:15.063
My lawyer can get her out at 10: 00
this morning . I'll tell you what you do.

01:43:15.523 --> 01:43:17.899
You bust into that dump she lives in,

01:43:18.276 --> 01:43:19.860
collect all her junk.

01:43:20.403 --> 01:43:21.736
Go down to the jail . Get her out.

01:43:21.863 --> 01:43:25.073
Take her straight over to a hotel
under a phoney name, right?

01:43:25.241 --> 01:43:27.784
You wanna keep away from
the reporters as much as possible.

01:43:27.910 --> 01:43:29.661
Do you know what I mean?
Will you do that?

01:43:29.745 --> 01:43:31.121
Sure, Mr Berman.

01:43:31.622 --> 01:43:34.624
- I can't tell you how much I appreciate...
- Forget it.

01:43:35.543 --> 01:43:37.043
I owe her something.

01:43:38.546 --> 01:43:42.549
Not that I owe her anything, I mean,
if you really get right down to it,

01:43:43.801 --> 01:43:45.385
but she's a crazy.

01:43:47.763 --> 01:43:49.097
She's a phoney.

01:43:50.725 --> 01:43:52.434
But she's a real phoney.

01:43:53.728 --> 01:43:56.605
- Know what I mean, kid?
- Yeah, I know what you mean.

01:43:57.565 --> 01:44:00.275
- Thanks, Mr Berman . Thanks a lot.
- Right!

01:44:08.242 --> 01:44:09.743
Why don't you behave?

01:44:22.131 --> 01:44:23.632
Quel night.

01:44:37.647 --> 01:44:40.482
I did a little housebreaking
while you were away.

01:44:41.025 --> 01:44:43.443
Clayton Hotel, driver. 84th and Madison.

01:44:45.655 --> 01:44:48.615
O.J. thinks it'd be a good idea
if you stayed out of sight for a while.

01:44:48.699 --> 01:44:52.452
I got most of your stuff here,
including cat. Hope he's all right.

01:44:53.120 --> 01:44:54.162
Yeah.

01:44:54.288 --> 01:44:55.455
Hello, cat.

01:44:56.040 --> 01:44:57.499
Poor no-name slob.

01:45:00.670 --> 01:45:02.671
Listen, darling.
Did you find that plane ticket?

01:45:02.755 --> 01:45:06.174
- Right here. We can cash it in.
- Cash it in? Are you kidding?

01:45:06.676 --> 01:45:08.009
What time is it?

01:45:08.094 --> 01:45:10.220
- A little after 10: 00.
- Good.

01:45:10.680 --> 01:45:12.597
Idlewild Airport, please, driver.

01:45:12.682 --> 01:45:15.350
- Never mind . You can't do that.
- Why not?

01:45:15.893 --> 01:45:18.061
You don't understand.
You're under indictment.

01:45:18.187 --> 01:45:21.231
If they catch you jumping bail, they'll
lock you up and throw away the key.

01:45:21.357 --> 01:45:22.899
Don't be ridiculous, darling.

01:45:23.025 --> 01:45:24.067
By the day after tomorrow,

01:45:24.193 --> 01:45:26.277
I'll be married to the future president
of Brazil.

01:45:26.362 --> 01:45:29.364
And that'll give me diplomatic immunity
or something.

01:45:30.908 --> 01:45:32.450
I wouldn't bet on it.

01:45:33.577 --> 01:45:35.078
What is it, darling?

01:45:38.082 --> 01:45:39.541
Message for you.

01:45:40.918 --> 01:45:42.210
Oh, yes, I see.

01:45:43.254 --> 01:45:45.005
Did he bring it in person, or was it,

01:45:45.089 --> 01:45:47.465
just there, shoved under the door?

01:45:47.550 --> 01:45:48.800
A cousin.

01:45:51.887 --> 01:45:54.055
Hand me my purse, will you, darling?

01:45:54.390 --> 01:45:57.600
A girl can't read that sort of thing
without her lipstick.

01:46:00.271 --> 01:46:02.313
You read it to me, will you, darling?

01:46:02.398 --> 01:46:04.649
I don't think I can quite bear...

01:46:05.401 --> 01:46:07.235
Sure you want me to?

01:46:11.115 --> 01:46:12.240
Okay.

01:46:13.743 --> 01:46:15.452
"My dearest little girl,"

01:46:16.078 --> 01:46:19.122
"I have loved you knowing
you were not as others."

01:46:19.248 --> 01:46:20.790
"But conceive of my despair"

01:46:20.916 --> 01:46:23.960
"upon discovering in such a brutal
and public style"

01:46:25.296 --> 01:46:27.672
"how very different you are
from the manner of woman"

01:46:27.757 --> 01:46:30.592
"a man of my position
could hope to make his wife."

01:46:32.511 --> 01:46:36.097
"I grieve for the disgrace
of your present circumstances."

01:46:36.182 --> 01:46:38.141
"And I do not find it in my heart"

01:46:38.267 --> 01:46:40.143
"to add my condemn"

01:46:40.603 --> 01:46:42.771
"to the condemn that surrounds you."

01:46:44.440 --> 01:46:47.776
"So I hope you will find it in your heart
not to condemn me."

01:46:48.444 --> 01:46:50.945
"I have my family to protect
and my name"

01:46:52.198 --> 01:46:55.200
"and I am a coward where
these institutions enter."

01:46:56.494 --> 01:47:00.830
"Forget me, beautiful child.
And may God be with you."

01:47:01.123 --> 01:47:02.332
"José."

01:47:04.794 --> 01:47:05.835
Well?

01:47:08.297 --> 01:47:10.048
Well, at least he's honest.

01:47:11.008 --> 01:47:13.051
- It's kind of touching.
- Touching?

01:47:13.135 --> 01:47:14.886
That square-ball jazz.

01:47:16.806 --> 01:47:18.139
He says he's a coward.

01:47:18.224 --> 01:47:22.143
All right. So he's not a regular rat
or even a super-rat.

01:47:22.228 --> 01:47:24.729
He's just a scared little mouse,
that's all.

01:47:25.648 --> 01:47:27.524
But, oh, golly.

01:47:28.192 --> 01:47:29.692
Gee, damn.

01:47:35.366 --> 01:47:38.034
Well, so much for South America.

01:47:39.995 --> 01:47:43.915
I didn't really think you were cut out
to be queen of the Pampas, anyway.

01:47:44.208 --> 01:47:46.668
- Clayton Hotel.
- Idlewild.

01:47:47.378 --> 01:47:48.503
What?

01:47:49.213 --> 01:47:51.756
The plane leaves at 12: 00.
And on it I plan to be.

01:47:51.841 --> 01:47:53.216
Holly, you can't.

01:47:56.345 --> 01:47:59.889
I'm not hotfooting it after José,
if that's what you think. Oh, no.

01:48:00.015 --> 01:48:03.518
As far as I'm concerned,
he's the future president of nowhere.

01:48:03.602 --> 01:48:05.937
Only why should I waste
a perfectly good plane ticket?

01:48:06.021 --> 01:48:08.189
Besides, I've never been to Brazil.

01:48:10.192 --> 01:48:13.361
Please, darling, don't sit there
looking at me like that.

01:48:13.696 --> 01:48:16.072
I'm going and that's all there is to it.

01:48:16.907 --> 01:48:18.616
Now all they want from me

01:48:18.701 --> 01:48:21.411
are my services as the state's witness
against Sally.

01:48:21.537 --> 01:48:24.289
Nobody has any intention
of prosecuting me.

01:48:24.373 --> 01:48:27.250
To begin with,
they don't have a ghost of a chance.

01:48:28.127 --> 01:48:30.962
Even so, this town's finished for me.

01:48:31.046 --> 01:48:32.547
At least for a while.

01:48:34.175 --> 01:48:37.886
There are certain shades of limelight
that can wreck a girl's complexion.

01:48:37.970 --> 01:48:40.763
They'll have the rope up
at every saloon in town.

01:48:42.141 --> 01:48:43.641
I'll tell you what you do for me, darling.

01:48:43.726 --> 01:48:44.893
When you get back to town,

01:48:44.977 --> 01:48:48.104
I want you to call up the
New York Times or whoever you call.

01:48:48.189 --> 01:48:51.566
I want you to mail me a list
of the 50 richest men in Brazil.

01:48:51.650 --> 01:48:52.942
The 50 richest.

01:48:55.487 --> 01:48:59.282
- Holly, I'm not going to let you do this.
- You're not going to let me?

01:48:59.658 --> 01:49:01.492
Holly, I'm in love with you.

01:49:01.577 --> 01:49:03.703
- So what?
- So what?

01:49:04.622 --> 01:49:05.788
So plenty.

01:49:06.665 --> 01:49:09.250
- I love you . You belong to me.
- No.

01:49:09.460 --> 01:49:12.045
- People don't belong to people.
- Of course they do.

01:49:12.129 --> 01:49:14.005
I'm not gonna let anyone
put me in a cage.

01:49:14.089 --> 01:49:16.341
I don't want to put you in a cage.
I want to love you.

01:49:16.425 --> 01:49:18.843
- It's the same thing.
- No, it's not.

01:49:19.220 --> 01:49:20.720
- Holly...
- I'm not Holly.

01:49:20.804 --> 01:49:23.097
I'm not Lula Mae, either.
I don't know who I am.

01:49:23.182 --> 01:49:24.390
I'm like cat, here.

01:49:24.475 --> 01:49:26.809
We're a couple of no-name slobs.
We belong to nobody.

01:49:26.894 --> 01:49:30.230
And nobody belongs to us.
We don't even belong to each other.

01:49:31.232 --> 01:49:32.440
Stop the cab.

01:49:38.697 --> 01:49:40.031
What do you think?

01:49:40.115 --> 01:49:43.284
This ought to be the right kind of place
for a tough guy like you.

01:49:43.369 --> 01:49:45.703
Garbage cans, rats galore.

01:49:45.788 --> 01:49:46.829
Scram!

01:49:47.164 --> 01:49:49.707
I said take off! Beat it!

01:49:50.167 --> 01:49:51.209
Let's go.

01:50:03.514 --> 01:50:04.597
Driver

01:50:07.601 --> 01:50:08.893
pull over here.

01:50:17.736 --> 01:50:20.863
You know what's wrong with you,
Miss Whoever-you-are?

01:50:21.240 --> 01:50:23.908
You're chicken . You've got no guts.

01:50:23.993 --> 01:50:27.078
You're afraid to stick out your chin
and say, "Okay, life's a fact."

01:50:27.162 --> 01:50:28.621
People do fall in love.

01:50:28.706 --> 01:50:30.581
People do belong to each other

01:50:30.666 --> 01:50:33.960
because that's the only chance
anybody's got for real happiness.

01:50:34.044 --> 01:50:37.297
You call yourself a free spirit,
a wild thing.

01:50:37.631 --> 01:50:40.717
And you're terrified somebody's
going to stick you in a cage.

01:50:40.801 --> 01:50:44.637
Well, baby, you're already in that cage.
You built it yourself.

01:50:44.722 --> 01:50:46.806
And it's not bounded in the west
by Tulip, Texas

01:50:46.890 --> 01:50:48.308
or in the east by Somaliland.

01:50:48.392 --> 01:50:49.851
It's wherever you go.

01:50:49.935 --> 01:50:53.896
Because no matter where you run,
you just end up running into yourself.

01:51:01.655 --> 01:51:04.699
Here. I've been carrying this thing
around for months.

01:51:05.284 --> 01:51:06.993
I don't want it any more.

01:51:59.713 --> 01:52:01.255
Here, cat!

01:52:02.049 --> 01:52:03.132
Cat!

01:52:12.851 --> 01:52:14.227
Where's the cat?

01:52:15.646 --> 01:52:16.896
I don't know.

01:52:28.492 --> 01:52:30.092
Cat!

01:52:50.472 --> 01:52:52.072
Cat.

01:52:53.305 --> 01:52:59.422
