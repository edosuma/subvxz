WEBVTT

00:10.244 --> 00:11.445
COMMANDER:
Enemy contact, three o'clock.

00:11.479 --> 00:13.714
Prepare to engage.
We are 200 meters away
from being able

00:13.747 --> 00:15.749
to take evasive action.
Gonna need cover.

00:15.783 --> 00:17.618
Roger. We got your six.

00:17.651 --> 00:19.487
Hold steady.
Copy that.

00:19.520 --> 00:20.788
"I love the smell

00:20.821 --> 00:22.256
of jet fuel in the morning!"

00:22.290 --> 00:23.591
That ain't the line, Chief.

00:23.624 --> 00:25.259
I know it's not the line.

00:25.293 --> 00:26.794
I know you know
it's not the line.

00:26.827 --> 00:28.796
We got 90 years of war movies.

00:28.829 --> 00:30.798
Why does it always gotta be
"I love the smell"?

00:30.831 --> 00:33.767
Relax, Grayson.
These are exercises.

00:33.801 --> 00:35.636
Not like we're gonna see
any real action

00:35.669 --> 00:37.305
in New Orleans anyways.

00:37.338 --> 00:38.672
Speak for yourself.

00:38.706 --> 00:39.640
She's six-one,

00:39.673 --> 00:41.275
her name's Sally,

00:41.309 --> 00:42.576
and I'm seeing her tonight.

00:42.610 --> 00:43.844
Six
Yep.

00:43.877 --> 00:47.648
All right, let's lock this down
and get your ass back to camp.

00:58.226 --> 01:00.694
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

01:00.728 --> 01:03.397
* Bang, bang, bang, bang

01:03.431 --> 01:05.833
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

01:05.866 --> 01:06.867
* How, how, how, how

01:06.900 --> 01:09.203
* Hey, hey

01:15.409 --> 01:16.777
* You gotta come on.

01:18.312 --> 01:20.281
Reports of Investigation.

01:20.314 --> 01:21.849
Uploaded, scanned and entered.

01:21.882 --> 01:24.685
Well, we call 'em R.O.I.s,
but not a bad start.

01:24.718 --> 01:26.687
Now, you can, uh...

01:26.720 --> 01:28.456
Clean the shotguns?
Done.

01:28.489 --> 01:29.757
Get Agent Pride
his chicory?

01:29.790 --> 01:31.825
Also done.
And that mail?

01:31.859 --> 01:33.261
Collated by
recipient,

01:33.294 --> 01:35.296
stacked by size.

01:35.329 --> 01:37.798
Kind of into having a newbie,
especially one that's not me.

01:37.831 --> 01:39.133
Listen here, luscious locks,

01:39.167 --> 01:40.834
I transferred from ATF,

01:40.868 --> 01:43.704
which means I come in
as a full agent.

01:43.737 --> 01:45.773
Pride says you report to us.

01:45.806 --> 01:48.309
That's 'cause you're
the Agent NFG.

01:48.342 --> 01:50.444
Yeah, I've read
all the manuals... twice.

01:50.478 --> 01:52.646
No such thing as "NFG."

01:52.680 --> 01:54.382
PATTON:
Oh, oh, oh.

01:54.415 --> 01:55.616
Let me clue you in.

01:55.649 --> 01:56.850
"N" stands for "new."

01:56.884 --> 01:58.552
"G" stands for "girl."

01:58.586 --> 01:59.620
And the "F"?

01:59.653 --> 02:00.654
Fancy?

02:00.688 --> 02:01.555
Funky.

02:02.790 --> 02:04.192
Okay, okay.

02:04.225 --> 02:05.459
I get it.

02:05.493 --> 02:06.827
Initiation.

02:06.860 --> 02:08.296
Rite of passage.

02:08.329 --> 02:10.398
But what you don't get

02:10.431 --> 02:12.233
is I can take
whatever you dish out.

02:12.266 --> 02:13.867
So, if you think you're gonna

02:13.901 --> 02:14.835
mess with me...

02:14.868 --> 02:16.337
think again.

02:17.705 --> 02:20.474
I, uh,
super-glued her badge shut.

02:20.508 --> 02:22.743
Oh, now that's good.

02:25.279 --> 02:26.514
"The Jackal."

02:28.849 --> 02:31.185
That's me.

02:31.219 --> 02:32.786
Really?

02:32.820 --> 02:35.923
Someone calls you The Jackal?

02:38.792 --> 02:40.828
Ah.

02:40.861 --> 02:42.496
Brotherman, brotherman.

02:42.530 --> 02:43.764
Seafood crepes.

02:43.797 --> 02:46.367
Ooh! Put one on a plate,
then in my belly.

02:47.935 --> 02:50.238
Ooh, hell of a lot
of zeroes here.

02:50.271 --> 02:53.541
From the sale
of the house.

02:53.574 --> 02:54.708
Divorce finalized?

02:54.742 --> 02:55.876
Civil.

02:55.909 --> 02:57.278
All good.
Yeah.

02:57.311 --> 02:58.679
Been there, done that.

02:58.712 --> 03:00.281
A couple of times.
Yeah, and I'm still

03:00.314 --> 03:01.615
trying to get it right.

03:01.649 --> 03:03.351
Hey, man, what's your plans?

03:05.353 --> 03:06.587
For this money?

03:06.620 --> 03:07.821
I've seen that look before.

03:07.855 --> 03:09.290
Listen.

03:09.323 --> 03:10.791
All right,
just imagine:

03:10.824 --> 03:11.825
you're in a field,

03:11.859 --> 03:13.461
dew on the ground,

03:13.494 --> 03:14.928
fog in the air.

03:14.962 --> 03:16.830
You turn.

03:16.864 --> 03:19.300
There she is, staring at you...

03:19.333 --> 03:22.836
Sexy Sadie.

03:22.870 --> 03:26.707
Sexy Sadie is a horse, right?

03:26.740 --> 03:28.842
No, a racehorse.

03:28.876 --> 03:30.844
Which you are
this close to owning.

03:32.045 --> 03:35.516
Someone blew up a Navy convoy.

03:35.549 --> 03:37.518
REPORTER:
...at least two casualties,

03:37.551 --> 03:38.852
with another six
being transported

03:38.886 --> 03:41.355
to various hospitals
across the city.

03:41.389 --> 03:43.357
As for the culprit,
no word other than...

03:43.391 --> 03:45.559
Imagining time is over.

03:45.593 --> 03:46.927
Work.

03:46.960 --> 03:49.963
MAN: We were simulating
an armed transport mission.

03:49.997 --> 03:51.832
The Marines were playing
opposition force.

03:51.865 --> 03:53.834
Got hit by an IED

03:53.867 --> 03:55.469
on the underside
of the bridge.

03:55.503 --> 03:57.971
Homeland's aware,
same as NORTHCOM.

03:58.005 --> 04:01.241
We got the Coast Guard assisting
our people in the water.

04:01.975 --> 04:03.944
Anyone claim responsibility?

04:03.977 --> 04:05.279
Radio silent.

04:05.313 --> 04:06.714
Cowards.

04:06.747 --> 04:08.916
Successful attack
on a military convoy?

04:08.949 --> 04:10.751
Think someone would want
to showcase their handiwork.

04:10.784 --> 04:12.886
Unless the silence is
because of what they took.

04:12.920 --> 04:16.490
We were transporting
a M982 Excalibur.

04:16.524 --> 04:17.958
That's a GPS-guided missile.

04:17.991 --> 04:19.627
Range of 36 miles.

04:19.660 --> 04:21.462
Precision of a sniper rifle.

04:21.495 --> 04:23.997
Thing can blow a plane out of
the sky and decimate a train.

04:24.031 --> 04:25.966
If somebody had the means
of launching that thing...

04:25.999 --> 04:27.468
Terrorist attack
waiting to happen.

04:30.504 --> 04:32.573
Here's your
two dead.

04:32.606 --> 04:33.841
Chief Pete Olson.

04:35.509 --> 04:37.378
Petty Officer Miles Grayson.

04:38.912 --> 04:43.584
Concussive force caused
middle ear damage

04:43.617 --> 04:45.519
and eye ruptures in both

04:45.553 --> 04:47.955
Petty Officer Grayson
and Chief Olson.

04:49.056 --> 04:49.890
C.O.D.?

04:49.923 --> 04:51.759
Probably blast lung.

04:51.792 --> 04:53.594
Common in an IED attack.

04:53.627 --> 04:55.996
Yeah, well, the vehicle
these poor kids were driving

04:56.029 --> 04:57.965
basically ended up
on top of one.

04:57.998 --> 05:01.001
I'll have Sebastian
analyze their clothes.

05:01.034 --> 05:02.703
If there's any residue,

05:02.736 --> 05:06.006
it might be able to help you
with the explosives they used.

05:06.039 --> 05:10.010
Nice to see you again,
Agent NFG.

05:10.043 --> 05:12.380
You, too?

05:12.413 --> 05:14.748
Found this on the bridge.

05:14.782 --> 05:16.950
75-millimeter
remote detonator.

05:16.984 --> 05:19.453
That means our bomber
had visual on the bridge.

05:19.487 --> 05:21.889
So, he-- or she--

05:21.922 --> 05:23.090
waits for the convoy

05:23.123 --> 05:25.426
to get to the bridge,

05:25.459 --> 05:26.860
then set the bomb off
when the Humvee

05:26.894 --> 05:28.462
with the missile passes over.

05:28.496 --> 05:29.963
Everything slams into the water,

05:29.997 --> 05:31.365
divers are waiting below.

05:31.399 --> 05:32.933
That's a big-ass operation.

05:32.966 --> 05:34.535
What's the range
on that detonator?

05:34.568 --> 05:36.770
Oh, anywhere from a thousand,
1,500 yards.

05:36.804 --> 05:38.939
Make a perimeter, split up.

05:38.972 --> 05:41.008
Go.
BRODY AND LASALLE:
Learn things.

05:41.041 --> 05:44.111
Oh, is that, like, a...
a thing we do?

05:45.145 --> 05:47.114
Go, get out of here.

05:47.147 --> 05:48.916
Oh.

05:56.757 --> 05:59.893
Looks like
the ground's disturbed.

05:59.927 --> 06:02.463
Might be where he stood.

06:02.496 --> 06:04.965
Damn good catch, Country Mouse.

06:04.998 --> 06:07.735
Pays to be observant,
City Mouse.

06:09.002 --> 06:10.971
Oh, I'm observant.

06:11.004 --> 06:13.006
What I observe is you
in the same jeans

06:13.040 --> 06:14.141
for, like, three days,

06:14.174 --> 06:16.109
getting texts
from chickadees

06:16.143 --> 06:17.578
named Kiki and Dawn.

06:17.611 --> 06:19.580
Hey, I ain't judging.

06:19.613 --> 06:22.115
Everybody's gotta find their way
to grieve and move on.

06:26.153 --> 06:28.121
Look over here.

06:28.155 --> 06:30.924
Aren't gonna be
any fingerprints on that.

06:30.958 --> 06:33.026
Guy's smart enough to employ
a solenoid air missile,

06:33.060 --> 06:34.495
he's gonna wear gloves.

06:34.528 --> 06:35.996
Yeah, but if he's hungry enough

06:36.029 --> 06:38.065
to eat the messiest candy bar
in the world...

06:38.098 --> 06:40.033
he's gonna take
those gloves off.

06:40.067 --> 06:41.068
So, now you can...

06:41.101 --> 06:42.570
Scan the wrapper,

06:42.603 --> 06:44.037
put the data in the Mobile AFIS.

06:44.071 --> 06:46.540
You gonna let me finish?

06:46.574 --> 06:49.009
You were undercover at ATF;
not much fingerprinting.

06:49.042 --> 06:52.079
Okay?
So you gotta get this right.

06:52.112 --> 06:53.947
Now, you can scan the wrapper

06:53.981 --> 06:55.916
and put the data
in Mobile AFIS.

07:01.822 --> 07:03.857
One point for
Country Mouse.

07:03.891 --> 07:06.193
PRIDE:
Navy Petty Officer Mark Yaden.

07:06.226 --> 07:07.761
Yaden was
dishonorably discharged

07:07.795 --> 07:09.597
three years ago
for insubordination.

07:09.630 --> 07:10.998
Dude made a habit of bitching

07:11.031 --> 07:12.666
about how sending
U.S. forces overseas

07:12.700 --> 07:14.067
was a misuse
of government power.

07:14.101 --> 07:15.503
After he got
the boot,

07:15.536 --> 07:16.937
Yaden didn't let up.

07:16.970 --> 07:18.105
Kept making threats...

07:18.138 --> 07:19.707
threats to make
the Navy pay

07:19.740 --> 07:21.074
for its "vast
governmental overreach."

07:21.108 --> 07:23.176
Patton got a GPS
on Yaden's phone.

07:23.210 --> 07:25.178
It's active now,
in the quarter.

07:25.212 --> 07:26.880
I'll drive.

07:39.827 --> 07:42.029
Says he's
20 yards away.

07:42.062 --> 07:43.564
There he is,
there's Yaden.

07:43.597 --> 07:47.501
Got our suspect.
St. Peters and Jackson Square.

07:47.535 --> 07:49.737
He's running. NCIS!

07:49.770 --> 07:52.540
Yaden, stop!

07:52.573 --> 07:54.174
Get down!

07:54.207 --> 07:55.809
Get down!

07:55.843 --> 07:57.210
He's got a gun,
everybody get down!

08:14.194 --> 08:15.262
Easy.

08:17.097 --> 08:18.766
Just put the gun down.

08:18.799 --> 08:20.200
Yaden, come on.

08:21.134 --> 08:22.269
Nobody has to die here.

08:22.302 --> 08:23.737
It's over.

08:23.771 --> 08:26.173
Only just begun.

08:26.206 --> 08:27.775
Sic semper tyrannis!

08:27.808 --> 08:29.777
No, wait!

08:44.992 --> 08:46.594
"Sic semper tyrannis"?

08:46.627 --> 08:50.864
"Thus always tyrants."

08:50.898 --> 08:53.567
What John Wilkes Booth said
after he assassinated Lincoln.

09:08.649 --> 09:10.050
PRIDE:
SECNAV's been notified.

09:10.083 --> 09:12.052
NORAD, NORTHCOM and Homeland

09:12.085 --> 09:13.754
are all over
our wayward missile.

09:13.787 --> 09:15.923
Also put the Secret Service
on notice.

09:15.956 --> 09:17.290
Think that's called for?

09:17.324 --> 09:19.660
Guy quotes one of four
presidential assassins,

09:19.693 --> 09:22.062
gotta take it seriously.
Where we at?

09:22.095 --> 09:23.296
Trying to figure out
the size and scope

09:23.330 --> 09:24.998
of this bombing operation.

09:25.032 --> 09:27.768
We searched the riverbanks
below the bridge,

09:27.801 --> 09:29.703
found tire tracks
and footprints,

09:29.737 --> 09:31.672
all different
sizes and treads.

09:31.705 --> 09:33.173
Most likely, it's where

09:33.206 --> 09:34.875
the Excalibur was taken
out of the water.

09:34.908 --> 09:37.110
And these people came with
some serious know-how.

09:37.144 --> 09:38.746
Excalibur has
an onboard GPS,

09:38.779 --> 09:40.313
but whoever swiped it
took it offline,

09:40.347 --> 09:41.915
preventing us
from tracking it.

09:41.949 --> 09:43.617
We know any more
about Yaden?

09:43.651 --> 09:45.753
So, I got Yaden.
Thank you.

09:45.786 --> 09:46.954
Damn it.

09:46.987 --> 09:49.056
Yaden...

09:51.058 --> 09:52.826
We'll do a remote
class later.

09:55.696 --> 09:58.031
After being discharged,
Yaden went off the grid.

09:58.065 --> 10:00.801
Dude's a ghost
from 2012 to 2014.

10:00.834 --> 10:02.069
Then, two months ago,

10:02.102 --> 10:03.971
he reappears
in New Orleans.

10:04.004 --> 10:05.105
Percy, here,
found an address

10:05.138 --> 10:07.074
at a one-bedroom rental
in Westwego.

10:07.107 --> 10:08.909
Questions on the table:

10:08.942 --> 10:10.978
who was Yaden working with,

10:11.011 --> 10:12.345
where's the missile now,

10:12.379 --> 10:13.947
and what the hell
do they plan to do with it?

10:16.750 --> 10:17.951
Loretta. I'll take it.

10:17.985 --> 10:19.319
Brody and Christopher,

10:19.352 --> 10:22.122
go to Yaden's
last known address.

10:22.155 --> 10:24.224
Sonja, you and Patton

10:24.257 --> 10:26.994
stay on the
missile's GPS.

10:28.829 --> 10:30.230
There's nothing I hate more

10:30.263 --> 10:32.900
than "large caliber bullet
to the head."

10:32.933 --> 10:35.769
Spent two hours scooping up
brain matter on Jackson Square.

10:35.803 --> 10:39.172
Well, I might have
something to cheer you up.

10:41.942 --> 10:44.845
Contribution to
Danny's college fund.

10:44.878 --> 10:46.847
Oh, that's thoughtful,
but I can't...

10:46.880 --> 10:49.249
You can. I've already
taken care of Laurel.

10:49.282 --> 10:51.084
Set up a little place
for my father,

10:51.118 --> 10:52.419
if he makes parole.

10:52.452 --> 10:54.454
Still got a chunk left over.

10:54.487 --> 10:56.323
And what are you gonna do
with that chunk?

10:56.356 --> 10:58.025
That remains to be seen.

11:01.862 --> 11:03.230
It's a new chapter.

11:03.263 --> 11:05.232
Got to heal.
Yeah.

11:05.265 --> 11:08.068
Why don't you do something
special for yourself?

11:08.101 --> 11:09.202
Go big.

11:09.236 --> 11:11.438
I'll buy an elephant.

11:17.110 --> 11:18.712
Thank you.

11:18.746 --> 11:20.781
Yaden?

11:20.814 --> 11:23.450
I found this on
his shoulder.

11:25.418 --> 11:28.355
I took the liberty of checking
it against the tattoo database.

11:28.388 --> 11:32.192
The symbol is
of a Montana Union.

11:32.225 --> 11:35.428
It's a separatist group
located outside Billings.

11:35.462 --> 11:39.432
So, militia member from
an outfit in Montana

11:39.466 --> 11:41.434
travels 2,000 miles to
be part of this attack?

11:41.468 --> 11:44.437
I also found an irritant
in the lungs.

11:44.471 --> 11:46.874
I'll identify
the source

11:46.907 --> 11:49.442
in case Yaden's recent
whereabouts gives us

11:49.476 --> 11:51.478
insight into where
your missile went to.

11:51.511 --> 11:54.447
And then there's this.

11:56.016 --> 11:57.517
Chemical burns.

11:57.550 --> 12:00.153
Yes, it's most likely
from handling explosives.

12:00.187 --> 12:02.823
I also discovered
layered calluses.

12:02.856 --> 12:05.458
Calluses which Yaden had,
but John Wilkes Booth did not.

12:05.492 --> 12:07.127
In college, I wrote
a 30-page ballistics analysis

12:07.160 --> 12:08.528
of the Lincoln assassination.

12:08.561 --> 12:11.231
Do you know the play
that Lincoln was seeing

12:11.264 --> 12:12.232
the night that Booth shot him?

12:12.265 --> 12:13.834
Our American Cousin.

12:13.867 --> 12:15.035
You know who Lincoln
was sitting with?

12:15.068 --> 12:17.537
Major Rathbone and his fiancée.

12:17.570 --> 12:20.841
You read my paper.
I took American history.

12:20.874 --> 12:23.476
Right, that... makes
a lot more sense.

12:23.510 --> 12:25.078
Sebastian, calluses.

12:25.112 --> 12:26.513
Oh, okay.

12:26.546 --> 12:28.548
So I ran a, uh,
tissue analysis,

12:28.581 --> 12:31.785
and I found micro-strands of
polyurethane and fiberglass.

12:31.819 --> 12:33.787
And these are the
key components...

12:33.821 --> 12:36.857
in, uh, hand grips at
modern climbing gyms.

12:36.890 --> 12:40.493
Your bomber scaled the bridge in
order to place the explosives.

12:40.527 --> 12:42.495
He would've had to train
for it somewhere.

12:42.529 --> 12:45.332
Thank you both.
Uh, I'll forward
what I got

12:45.365 --> 12:48.201
on the Montana militia
to Agent Percy.
PRIDE: All right,

12:48.235 --> 12:50.070
and I'll let Chris and Brody
know about the climbing angle.

12:50.103 --> 12:51.504
I'll head back
to my office.

12:51.538 --> 12:53.106
That way, we all have
something to do.

12:55.442 --> 12:57.911
I called ahead; we're supposed
to talk to Sara Strand.

12:57.945 --> 12:59.179
She's been working

12:59.212 --> 13:01.248
with Yaden since he moved
to New Orleans.

13:01.281 --> 13:02.482
Nice work, Jackal.

13:02.515 --> 13:04.317
Uh, nickname
in high school.

13:04.351 --> 13:06.553
Look, someone mailed me these
random high school pictures.

13:06.586 --> 13:08.021
No name.

13:08.055 --> 13:10.123
No return address.

13:10.157 --> 13:12.359
Might be an old boyfriend.

13:12.392 --> 13:13.927
Mr. Music, there,
he's eyeing you.

13:13.961 --> 13:16.596
WOMAN:
So, just sign right here...

13:16.629 --> 13:17.831
BRODY:
There's Sara.

13:17.865 --> 13:18.866
Brunette.

13:20.133 --> 13:21.935
SARA:
Mark blew up a bridge?

13:21.969 --> 13:24.604
He seemed sweet, laid-back.

13:24.637 --> 13:26.206
Uh, watch that top hand, Katy!

13:26.239 --> 13:30.210
I mean, I only knew him
for a couple of months,

13:30.243 --> 13:33.046
but he just seemed like one
of those extreme sports dudes.

13:33.080 --> 13:35.215
He was extreme,
all right.

13:35.248 --> 13:37.050
Uh, you know,

13:37.084 --> 13:40.020
I'd be happy to hand over
all our records if that helps.

13:40.053 --> 13:41.154
Yeah, it would.

13:41.188 --> 13:42.522
Every detail counts.
Okay.

13:42.555 --> 13:44.557
Good, mm-hmm.

13:44.591 --> 13:46.994
Ever rock

13:47.027 --> 13:49.863
Got a fear of heights,
remember?
Oh, that's right.

13:49.897 --> 13:52.065
Well, one of the key elements
is bare fingers for grip,

13:52.099 --> 13:53.934
and she's wearing gloves.

13:53.967 --> 13:55.936
LASALLE:
And long sleeves.

13:55.969 --> 13:56.970
I wonder what's
underneath all that.

14:00.573 --> 14:02.375
BRODY: You and Yaden
built the bomb

14:02.409 --> 14:04.377
that killed
two innocent sailors.

14:04.411 --> 14:07.080
Nobody's truly innocent,
are they?

14:07.114 --> 14:08.916
Certainly you're not.

14:10.951 --> 14:13.653
The opposition is rising,
Agent Brody.

14:13.686 --> 14:16.656
The Stars and Stripes will burn,

14:16.689 --> 14:20.493
and out of its ashes
will manifest a revolution.

14:20.527 --> 14:22.930
The Excalibur.

14:22.963 --> 14:24.397
Where is it?

14:24.431 --> 14:27.600
Sic semper tyrannis.

14:27.634 --> 14:30.270
Sara Strand is really
Darla Hendricks,

14:30.303 --> 14:32.072
a member of the
Free State Nation,

14:32.105 --> 14:34.607
a separatist group
out of South Carolina.

14:34.641 --> 14:38.578
Their goal: the abolishment of
the military-industrial complex.

14:38.611 --> 14:42.615
Same basic ideology as Yaden,
but both groups are reclusive.

14:42.649 --> 14:43.984
And from elsewhere.

14:44.017 --> 14:45.618
And it looks like
they're not alone.

14:45.652 --> 14:47.955
BRODY:
You shutting up?

14:47.988 --> 14:49.990
Checked in with my old
ATF contacts

14:50.023 --> 14:52.960
for info on the Montana Union,
hit the mother lode.

14:54.527 --> 14:56.930
All right, you want
to work that out for me?

14:56.964 --> 14:58.331
No problem,
City Mouse.
Cool.

14:58.365 --> 15:01.334
Red dots are
known militants.

15:01.368 --> 15:02.669
Now, I built my
own database,

15:02.702 --> 15:05.672
found travel records,
new addresses.

15:05.705 --> 15:08.275
You got members of the
Southern United Alliance,

15:08.308 --> 15:11.511
Wyoming Marksmen,
Arizona Separatists,

15:11.544 --> 15:14.714
all migrating to New Orleans
in the past nine months.

15:14.747 --> 15:16.416
"Revolution" is what she said.

15:16.449 --> 15:18.618
SONJA: We're talking
the most dangerous

15:18.651 --> 15:21.454
anti-American militants
this country has to offer.

15:21.488 --> 15:22.689
Working together...

15:22.722 --> 15:24.324
in New Orleans...

15:26.326 --> 15:29.329
...on a plan which involves
some big-ass missile.

15:40.473 --> 15:43.176
90 militants massing
in New Orleans?

15:43.210 --> 15:44.477
Quite a catch, Dwayne.

15:44.511 --> 15:46.179
Wish I could take
credit, Miguel,

15:46.213 --> 15:49.382
but ATF's loss is our gain.

15:49.416 --> 15:50.984
Mighty Mouse.

15:53.153 --> 15:54.387
Not bad for an NFG.

15:54.421 --> 15:56.123
You got to be
kidding me.

15:57.224 --> 15:58.591
Agent Lasalle paid me.

15:58.625 --> 16:00.293
Well, I'm taking
the blood money.

16:00.327 --> 16:02.462
Went spelunking around
the back-end forums

16:02.495 --> 16:04.131
of separatists sites--

16:04.164 --> 16:06.466
Separatist Watch,
Patriot Renegades--

16:06.499 --> 16:08.601
I'm gonna need, like,
three showers tonight.

16:08.635 --> 16:11.604
In the last decade, ATF has
developed multiple aliases

16:11.638 --> 16:14.441
using dummy accounts in
order to monitor activity.

16:14.474 --> 16:16.543
And in the last year,
a ton of chatter.

16:16.576 --> 16:18.145
People pledging allegiance

16:18.178 --> 16:20.147
to someone going by
the nickname "the Father."

16:20.180 --> 16:22.115
The Father

16:22.149 --> 16:23.616
Brant Boudreau.

16:23.650 --> 16:25.552
Now, here's where
we do a short prayer,

16:25.585 --> 16:26.619
hope that I do this right.

16:26.653 --> 16:29.089
Yes.

16:30.257 --> 16:31.058
Brant Boudreau.

16:31.091 --> 16:32.225
MIGUEL:
Back in the late naughts,

16:32.259 --> 16:33.793
we chased Boudreau

16:33.826 --> 16:36.229
all over the South
on weapons charges.

16:36.263 --> 16:38.631
In 2010, he shed
his real name,

16:38.665 --> 16:41.068
insisted on being
called "the Father."

16:41.101 --> 16:43.070
Saw himself as the patriarch

16:43.103 --> 16:44.804
of the modern American
militia movement.

16:44.837 --> 16:48.075
Now, militias have always
been fragmented and fringe.

16:48.108 --> 16:50.077
Boudreau's vision was to
bring them all together,

16:50.110 --> 16:51.811
modernized and weaponized.

16:51.844 --> 16:53.813
All right, so I digitized
the videos like you asked.

16:53.846 --> 16:55.348
They're up on the server.

16:55.382 --> 16:57.217
Uh, can you play
the recruitment video?

16:57.250 --> 16:58.651
Mm-hmm.

16:58.685 --> 17:01.354
SONJA: So based on an
embedded time stamp,

17:01.388 --> 17:03.356
this was filmed over a year ago,

17:03.390 --> 17:04.824
but it was just
recently uploaded.

17:04.857 --> 17:07.827
Our government and its muscle,
the military,

17:07.860 --> 17:10.730
are run by oligarchs,

17:10.763 --> 17:13.766
fattening their pockets with
excessive tax on true Americans.

17:13.800 --> 17:16.603
They are liars and cheats.

17:16.636 --> 17:19.839
And the great sin
against our great country

17:19.872 --> 17:22.709
is being cowed and controlled
by false prophets.

17:22.742 --> 17:25.378
Boudreau is working
off the tipping point theory.

17:25.412 --> 17:27.214
He believes a series
of successful attacks

17:27.247 --> 17:30.350
would upend domestic
financial markets,

17:30.383 --> 17:32.352
cause an economic downturn

17:32.385 --> 17:34.287
and incite people to turn
on the government.

17:34.321 --> 17:36.456
And we have any line on him?

17:36.489 --> 17:38.291
We got a list of 30 properties

17:38.325 --> 17:41.128
that were or still are
owned in Boudreau's name.

17:41.161 --> 17:42.595
Take Lasalle, check 'em all.

17:43.863 --> 17:46.733
SONJA:
15th property, nothing.

17:46.766 --> 17:48.801
Yeah, this one's
a little shabby,

17:48.835 --> 17:50.837
even for a
country mouse.
Ooh.

17:50.870 --> 17:54.374
I got $20 say
you feel right at home.

18:00.547 --> 18:02.215
:
Hey.

18:02.249 --> 18:03.750
Someone's in here.

18:05.818 --> 18:07.854
NCIS!

18:11.524 --> 18:13.193
Federal agents!

18:24.937 --> 18:26.806
Who the hell are you?!

18:26.839 --> 18:29.142
NCIS!
Prove it!

18:29.176 --> 18:30.843
SONJA:
Okay.

18:30.877 --> 18:34.514
Now I'm gonna reach down
and get my badge...

18:34.547 --> 18:36.549
and flip it open.

18:38.285 --> 18:39.886
Yo, what the hell?

18:39.919 --> 18:41.888
Don't look at me; Brody did it.

18:44.557 --> 18:46.359
Here you go, ma'am.

18:46.393 --> 18:47.794
NCIS.

18:48.828 --> 18:50.463
Drop the weapon.

18:51.931 --> 18:55.335
So you're Anna Boudreau,
Brant Boudreau's ex

18:55.368 --> 18:57.370
And you live in here?

18:59.372 --> 19:01.174
It's all I got.

19:01.208 --> 19:04.611
Brant... took the family money.

19:04.644 --> 19:06.613
Ruined us.

19:06.646 --> 19:08.448
Any idea where Brant is now?

19:08.481 --> 19:10.217
Don't know.

19:11.218 --> 19:12.785
Don't care.

19:12.819 --> 19:14.921
What?

19:14.954 --> 19:16.756
You want to
check my phone?

19:16.789 --> 19:20.760
You check whatever
the hell you want.

19:20.793 --> 19:24.764
I used to try
and find him for alimony.

19:24.797 --> 19:28.968
It just... ain't no use.

19:29.001 --> 19:32.205
Whenever I go looking...

19:32.239 --> 19:33.706
trouble finds me.

19:33.740 --> 19:35.508
Trouble got a name, miss?

19:35.542 --> 19:37.544
If I told you,
that would come back at me.

19:37.577 --> 19:39.979
Know what else will
come back at you?

19:40.012 --> 19:40.947
Bersa Thunder.

19:40.980 --> 19:43.350
Serial number's been altered.

19:43.383 --> 19:46.386
Ooh, that's a federal offense.

19:46.419 --> 19:48.588
No bueno.

19:51.023 --> 19:52.959
What do you
want to know?

19:52.992 --> 19:54.561
Boudreau's ex says

19:54.594 --> 19:56.796
a guy named Zed Hastings
is second in command.

19:56.829 --> 19:59.699
Trained Army Ranger,
went bad just like Yaden.

19:59.732 --> 20:00.967
Narcotics,
aggravated assault.

20:01.000 --> 20:03.002
Known Klansman.

20:03.035 --> 20:05.004
Your guy there, Hastings,
is "Red Eagle" online.

20:05.037 --> 20:07.006
He's been in touch with many
of the out-of-state militants

20:07.039 --> 20:09.476
that Agent Percy has
confirmed are in New Orleans.

20:09.509 --> 20:10.677
BRODY: Want me to
put out a BOLO?

20:10.710 --> 20:12.312
Picking Hastings
up alerts Boudreau

20:12.345 --> 20:13.946
that we're closing in.

20:13.980 --> 20:15.948
He'll likely go
further underground.

20:15.982 --> 20:18.718
And launch whatever
attacks he has planned.

20:18.751 --> 20:20.953
What if we engage him?

20:20.987 --> 20:23.990
I can get our resources
down here in 24 hours.

20:24.023 --> 20:25.858
You said
you've developed aliases?

20:26.893 --> 20:28.695
Let's use one to get inside.

20:28.728 --> 20:30.730
You?

20:30.763 --> 20:33.733
Always wanted to join
the revolution.

20:42.074 --> 20:43.676
SONJA:
Huh.

20:43.710 --> 20:45.512
Can't say I like the look.

20:45.545 --> 20:47.780
That makes two of us.

20:47.814 --> 20:50.817
Oh, your wife get
all the good stuff?

20:51.918 --> 20:53.520
What you got, Percy?

20:55.388 --> 20:58.358
Dossier on ATF's identity.

20:58.391 --> 21:00.793
Marcus Kyle, Kansas Radicals.

21:00.827 --> 21:01.994
Thanks.

21:02.028 --> 21:03.796
And this is
your lifeline.

21:03.830 --> 21:05.898
Audio and a tracker.

21:05.932 --> 21:07.667
And listen,
Hastings,

21:07.700 --> 21:08.935
he's gonna throw some
names out there,

21:08.968 --> 21:10.770
try to trip you up.
I know.

21:10.803 --> 21:12.972
Speak as little as possible.

21:13.005 --> 21:15.475
Every word is a potential trap.

21:15.508 --> 21:16.843
I've done this before.

21:18.978 --> 21:20.012
LASALLE:
King.

21:21.981 --> 21:23.816
Got a potential
meet with Hastings.

21:28.020 --> 21:29.322
Well, take Brody.

21:31.057 --> 21:34.060
Percy, you keep Patton on task.
I want to be there.

21:41.033 --> 21:45.004
Back at the ATF,
you were on the street...

21:45.037 --> 21:49.075
making your own rules,
your own thing.

21:49.108 --> 21:51.478
Here, part of a team.

21:51.511 --> 21:53.045
You do what's needed.

21:53.079 --> 21:55.081
And right now,

21:55.114 --> 21:58.017
that's figuring out
where those videos were taped.

21:58.050 --> 22:00.953
Aside from that...

22:00.987 --> 22:02.755
appreciate your worry.

22:16.836 --> 22:18.438
These pictures aren't real.

22:20.473 --> 22:21.941
You mentioned
Mr. Music Man, right?

22:21.974 --> 22:23.576
So, I looked into it.

22:23.610 --> 22:26.413
Turns out it's a guy
named Billy Jay.

22:26.446 --> 22:28.147
A friend of my sister's.

22:28.180 --> 22:29.749
The one that was killed?

22:29.782 --> 22:31.117
Yeah. In fact, all these people

22:31.150 --> 22:32.985
are my sister's friends,
and I don't remember

22:33.019 --> 22:34.921
doing any of this stuff.

22:34.954 --> 22:37.023
So, what?
Someone photoshopped you?

22:37.056 --> 22:40.126
Into random pictures that
my sister was originally in.

22:41.628 --> 22:43.029
PRIDE :
Going in now.

22:43.062 --> 22:45.097
All right, he's in.

22:45.131 --> 22:48.067
Wasn't gonna come.

22:48.100 --> 22:52.905
Didn't think you boys
had much going on

22:52.939 --> 22:54.541
till I heard
what happened on the bridge.

22:54.574 --> 22:56.876
Ye of little faith.

22:56.909 --> 22:58.878
I put stock in
what I see.

22:58.911 --> 23:02.048
Tucker Klint says
you're a good man,

23:02.081 --> 23:04.417
says you're up for a fight.

23:04.451 --> 23:05.785
We go back.

23:05.818 --> 23:09.021
Yeah, I bet you do.

23:09.055 --> 23:12.692
Who else you know?

23:12.725 --> 23:15.562
Carl Wahl?

23:15.595 --> 23:17.129
Big Ruddy?

23:17.163 --> 23:19.131
Taylor Hoff?

23:19.165 --> 23:20.567
Testing me?

23:20.600 --> 23:22.168
Just making sure.

23:22.201 --> 23:25.404
Yeah, well...

23:27.239 --> 23:29.976
Carl Wahl
is out of North Dakota.

23:30.009 --> 23:32.078
Big Ruddy...

23:32.111 --> 23:34.213
probably made up.

23:34.246 --> 23:37.650
Taylor Hoff's been dead
since '09.

23:39.118 --> 23:41.488
It's a little late for testing.

23:41.521 --> 23:43.723
If I was you,
I wouldn't let me

23:43.756 --> 23:47.059
get within a thousand feet
unless I'd been fully vetted.

23:47.093 --> 23:48.495
I'm legit.

23:48.528 --> 23:50.563
Not sure about
you anymore.

23:50.597 --> 23:51.430
Hey!

23:54.233 --> 23:57.604
How far you willing to go
to see how legit I am?

24:12.184 --> 24:13.753
Let's get him out.

24:25.932 --> 24:27.934
Clear.

24:29.201 --> 24:30.537
There's no way they could've

24:30.570 --> 24:33.205
got out of here
without us seeing them.

24:33.239 --> 24:35.474
:
Lasalle.

24:42.649 --> 24:44.483
BRODY:
Crawl space.

24:47.219 --> 24:49.021
LASALLE:
Watch was his lifeline.

24:53.560 --> 24:55.562
*

25:14.246 --> 25:14.914
BRODY
We followed the tunnel.

25:14.947 --> 25:16.683
It dumps out at a gravel road

25:16.716 --> 25:18.050
about an eighth of a mile
from the bar.

25:18.084 --> 25:20.286
Found tire tracks,
heading south.

25:20.319 --> 25:22.021
BRODY: Sending you a picture
of the tread right now.

25:22.054 --> 25:23.556
LASALLE:
Get them to Sebastian.

25:23.590 --> 25:24.824
See if he can
identify the vehicle.

25:24.857 --> 25:27.760
Uh, okay, but, um,

25:27.794 --> 25:29.896
I'm trying to pull up
your location so I can

25:29.929 --> 25:33.199
access the traffic cams, but...

25:34.767 --> 25:35.868
Yeah, I got your back, sister.

25:35.902 --> 25:37.737
Thank you.

25:37.770 --> 25:39.772
BRODY: Where are you
with Boudreau's videos?

25:39.806 --> 25:41.307
You got anything?

25:41.340 --> 25:43.109
We're trying to trace
his I.P. address.

25:43.142 --> 25:45.111
Hoping it'll lead
to wherever Pride has gone,

25:45.144 --> 25:48.114
but these guys got some
serious encryption software.

25:48.147 --> 25:50.149
So, we're driving blind?
PATTON: Yeah.

25:50.182 --> 25:52.084
The minute I got something,
you will, too.

25:52.118 --> 25:53.786
Thanks, Pat.

25:55.822 --> 25:57.089
My guess?

25:57.123 --> 26:00.026
King's already hot
on finding the missile.

26:01.928 --> 26:04.731
We're here.

26:13.873 --> 26:16.208
Welcome to the
resistance, brother.

26:17.309 --> 26:20.012
Ruby Ridge, Waco...

26:20.046 --> 26:21.848
they knew the truth.

26:21.881 --> 26:24.751
But they were backwoods,
low-tech.

26:24.784 --> 26:27.820
They had no plan,
so they ended up sitting ducks,

26:27.854 --> 26:29.856
waiting to get
roasted on a spit.

26:29.889 --> 26:30.857
We got a plan?

26:30.890 --> 26:32.258
Yeah, we got a toy.

26:33.292 --> 26:34.861
Father calls.

26:34.894 --> 26:36.195
Yo, Loco!

26:36.228 --> 26:38.898
Let's go.
Eyes to the sun, brother.

26:38.931 --> 26:40.332
'Cause when it goes down,

26:40.366 --> 26:43.903
we take our fight
to the betrayers.

27:05.992 --> 27:07.960
You looking
for something?

27:07.994 --> 27:09.829
You was poking around.

27:09.862 --> 27:11.664
I was just hungry.

27:11.698 --> 27:12.965
Got any food around here?

27:12.999 --> 27:14.100
I know you.

27:14.133 --> 27:16.002
You local?

27:16.035 --> 27:17.937
Out of Kansas.

27:17.970 --> 27:19.939
Been there?

27:21.440 --> 27:22.775
There's a
stocked freezer

27:22.809 --> 27:24.310
in the mess.

27:24.343 --> 27:25.812
I'll show you.

27:30.783 --> 27:33.352
Our New America
will return to the values

27:33.385 --> 27:34.954
of the Original America,

27:34.987 --> 27:37.123
and will protect, first,
the Original Americans.

27:37.156 --> 27:38.925
Tell me you need some help,

27:38.958 --> 27:40.860
'cause that tire tread
that Brody and Lasalle sent me

27:40.893 --> 27:44.096
is about as useful
as a kangaroo on a pogo stick.

27:44.130 --> 27:45.698
That made more sense

27:45.732 --> 27:47.299
on the drive over.

27:47.333 --> 27:49.702
Not much better here.

27:49.736 --> 27:51.203
Father videos?

27:51.237 --> 27:52.972
Man, I can't listen
to his ass anymore.

27:53.005 --> 27:56.275
Hey, come see if you grok
what I been going batty over.

27:56.308 --> 27:59.045
Did you just
use the word "grok"?

27:59.078 --> 28:01.447
Uh...

28:01.480 --> 28:03.415
Well, there's a light.

28:03.449 --> 28:05.117
Yeah, but where's
it coming from?

28:05.151 --> 28:07.153
SEBASTIAN:
Let's zoom in.

28:08.755 --> 28:10.356
The lights show up
in every video?

28:10.389 --> 28:11.991
Most, but not all.

28:12.024 --> 28:14.126
It goes from right
to left in the frame.

28:14.160 --> 28:16.228
And it's always
the same height on the wall.

28:16.262 --> 28:18.297
Reflection from
a camera lens?

28:18.330 --> 28:19.732
Camera's locked off.

28:19.766 --> 28:21.133
It wouldn't be
floating like that.

28:21.167 --> 28:22.869
Headlights through a window?

28:22.902 --> 28:24.804
If they were headlights...

28:24.837 --> 28:26.405
The diameter would
shift as the vehicle

28:26.438 --> 28:28.040
got further away, right.

28:28.074 --> 28:30.009
I just want you to know
that I'm suppressing

28:30.042 --> 28:32.078
the urge to whistle the theme
to Close Encounters right now.

28:32.111 --> 28:34.213
Hey, Dr. Wade wants us
on the plasma.

28:35.547 --> 28:36.749
Heard from Dwayne?

28:36.783 --> 28:37.884
Nothing.

28:37.917 --> 28:39.752
Well, if it helps,

28:39.786 --> 28:42.388
I've identified
the irritant in Yaden's lungs.

28:42.421 --> 28:45.524
It's silicon dioxide-- sand.

28:45.557 --> 28:47.827
Did you, uh,
run a chemical breakdown?

28:47.860 --> 28:50.362
Forwarding it now.

28:51.563 --> 28:53.432
SEBASTIAN:
Uh, two percent chlorite,

28:53.465 --> 28:55.034
one percent glauconite

28:55.067 --> 28:56.468
with a high concentration
of oil deposits.

28:56.502 --> 28:58.004
Ton of beaches were affected

28:58.037 --> 28:59.471
by the Deep Water
Horizon spill.

28:59.505 --> 29:01.007
That's miles and miles
of coastline.

29:01.040 --> 29:02.141
But how many beaches are...

29:02.174 --> 29:03.943
BOTH:
...near lighthouses?

29:03.976 --> 29:06.813
The light goes and comes.

29:06.846 --> 29:08.080
Yeah, moves right to left,

29:08.114 --> 29:09.148
always the same height
on the wall.

29:09.181 --> 29:10.216
A lighthouse lamp would do that.

29:10.249 --> 29:13.552
Thank you, Dr. Wade.

29:13.585 --> 29:15.154
Okay, pulling up
maps right now.

29:15.187 --> 29:16.923
All right, all right,
lighthouses near beaches

29:16.956 --> 29:19.025
affected by the
Deep Water spill.

29:19.058 --> 29:20.226
SONJA:
There.

29:20.259 --> 29:21.393
Near Holly Beach.

29:21.427 --> 29:24.096
Gonna go notify
my agent abusers.

29:27.266 --> 29:29.468
The Father--
he live there?

29:29.501 --> 29:31.904
That's where he
makes the plans.

29:31.938 --> 29:33.405
Look forward
to meeting him.

29:33.439 --> 29:35.074
No one meets the
Father, except Zed.

29:35.107 --> 29:36.142
Safer that way.

29:36.175 --> 29:38.577
Awful big house
for one person, huh?

29:38.610 --> 29:40.880
Last night,
I saw him wheel

29:40.913 --> 29:42.982
some piece of
munitions out there.

29:45.084 --> 29:46.953
Big mystery what
exactly, but...

29:46.986 --> 29:49.055
you ever heard
of the USS Eagle?

29:49.088 --> 29:51.123
That a ship?

29:51.157 --> 29:52.358
Navy.

29:52.391 --> 29:54.026
Docked in New Orleans.

29:54.060 --> 29:56.929
From what I hear,
we're gonna sink it.

29:58.397 --> 30:00.166
Sic semper tyrannis.

30:00.199 --> 30:03.870
Sic semper tyrannis.

30:05.271 --> 30:07.373
All right, boys, we got company!

30:07.406 --> 30:08.908
Come on!

30:10.309 --> 30:12.111
The river, go!

30:12.144 --> 30:14.146
This way.
Cover the river!

30:15.214 --> 30:16.348
You! With me!

30:16.382 --> 30:18.084
Right here. This way,
this way right here.

30:18.117 --> 30:20.119
Turn right here.

30:26.993 --> 30:28.127
No movement.

30:28.160 --> 30:31.030
All right, I'll pull ashore.

30:31.063 --> 30:34.066
CONNER:
Come on.

30:34.100 --> 30:36.102
Kevlar vests.

30:36.135 --> 30:38.304
Bet you they're Feds.

30:38.337 --> 30:40.940
Hey, bud.

30:40.973 --> 30:42.441
You shoot,

30:42.474 --> 30:44.343
they'll return fire.

30:44.376 --> 30:46.278
Doesn't matter.

30:46.312 --> 30:48.147
We got to put them down
before they call for backup.

30:48.180 --> 30:50.449
Just a little closer,
I can take them both out.

30:50.482 --> 30:52.084
Come on, little closer.

30:53.185 --> 30:54.253
Come on.

30:56.122 --> 30:57.389
BRODY: Lasalle!

30:57.423 --> 30:59.959
What the hell?!
Why should you have all the fun?

31:03.195 --> 31:04.396
Are you all right?
Yeah.

31:04.430 --> 31:05.564
He hit my vest.

31:05.597 --> 31:06.966
See who shot me.

31:09.969 --> 31:12.138
Pride.
What?

31:12.171 --> 31:14.106
I think Pride's the one
who shot you.

31:14.140 --> 31:15.241
Pride?

31:29.989 --> 31:32.324
Got close to a hundred federal
agents moving into position.

31:32.358 --> 31:33.926
We can move in
a moment's notice.

31:33.960 --> 31:35.327
We got to be careful.

31:35.361 --> 31:38.330
Pride's in there. I'm good.

31:38.364 --> 31:40.666
I think USS Eagle
is under attack.

31:40.699 --> 31:42.101
Pride did this.

31:42.134 --> 31:43.602
Sign language for "eagle."

31:43.635 --> 31:46.038
First Russian,
now sign language?

31:46.072 --> 31:48.007
You're a woman of
many talents, Brody.

31:48.040 --> 31:50.442
USS Eag docked
at port this morning.

31:50.476 --> 31:52.144
So I'll contact the Navy,
get Sonja over there.

31:52.178 --> 31:54.480
We got to move
that ship out of range.

31:54.513 --> 31:55.982
All right.

31:58.284 --> 32:00.252
What the hell
happened out there?

32:00.286 --> 32:02.521
I hit the male agent,
but I don't think I killed him.

32:02.554 --> 32:03.622
Next time.

32:03.655 --> 32:05.424
Next time is now!

32:05.457 --> 32:06.993
Listen up!

32:07.026 --> 32:08.627
Orders from Father!

32:08.660 --> 32:12.598
When the alarm sounds,
we take our fight to them!

32:12.631 --> 32:14.066
What's the alarm for?

32:14.100 --> 32:16.168
It means the toy is ready.

32:22.008 --> 32:23.642
MAN : All hands,

32:23.675 --> 32:26.378
make immediate preparations
for getting underway.

32:26.412 --> 32:29.648
How long is it gonna take you
to get out of the port?
Another 20 minutes.

32:29.681 --> 32:31.517
I don't think you have
that kind of time, Commander.

32:31.550 --> 32:33.052
Don't have a choice,
Agent Percy. You don't just

32:33.085 --> 32:34.686
snap your finger and move
tons of metal and sail it.

32:34.720 --> 32:36.688
You don't understand.
Trust me, nobody knows

32:36.722 --> 32:39.091
the damage the Excalibur
can do more than me.

32:46.565 --> 32:48.634
There's plenty for all of us.

32:48.667 --> 32:50.636
No need to be greedy
this time, friend.

32:56.075 --> 32:58.077
Jammed.

32:58.110 --> 32:59.778
Let me see.
Nah, no.

32:59.811 --> 33:02.014
Let me get another one.

33:06.285 --> 33:08.120
Lot of movement over there.

33:08.154 --> 33:10.022
They get the Eagle
out of port?

33:10.056 --> 33:11.623
Another ten minutes.

33:11.657 --> 33:13.125
LASALLE:
Yeah, something's going down.

33:13.159 --> 33:15.394
According to this map,

33:15.427 --> 33:17.729
if we cross the river
about a mile up,

33:17.763 --> 33:19.631
we can access
a drainage pipe that lets out

33:19.665 --> 33:21.500
behind this building.
You think we can

33:21.533 --> 33:22.601
get in unnoticed?

33:22.634 --> 33:24.203
I think we can try.

33:37.349 --> 33:38.517
MAN:
Hey!

33:38.550 --> 33:39.718
Where the hell

33:39.751 --> 33:41.120
you think you're going?

33:41.153 --> 33:42.088
Well, I was just...

33:55.867 --> 33:59.105
*

34:13.619 --> 34:15.254
CONNER:
Drop that gun!

34:17.556 --> 34:18.757
Drop it!

34:22.761 --> 34:24.163
What is this?

34:26.132 --> 34:28.700
Come on...

34:28.734 --> 34:30.702
I said, sit down!

34:30.736 --> 34:32.671
There's a traitor
in our midst!

34:34.740 --> 34:36.308
You saw him in there.

34:36.342 --> 34:37.609
The Father

34:37.643 --> 34:40.479
is dead, for a long time.

34:40.512 --> 34:44.116
So ask yourselves:
who killed him?

34:44.150 --> 34:45.884
Who did it?

34:45.917 --> 34:47.186
Could have been
this guy right here.

34:47.219 --> 34:49.155
This man... this man is wrong.

34:49.188 --> 34:50.522
Could have been you.
What are you talking about?

34:50.556 --> 34:51.657
Or Zed.

34:51.690 --> 34:53.892
Anybody see Zed? Or you or you!

34:53.925 --> 34:55.261
Whoever did it,

34:55.294 --> 34:58.664
he couldn't have
been leading you.

34:58.697 --> 35:00.132
He couldn't have
been leading us!

35:00.166 --> 35:03.235
The Father couldn't
have given orders

35:03.269 --> 35:05.237
to take on an army
of federal agents.

35:07.239 --> 35:09.908
So who exactly
have we been following?

35:09.941 --> 35:13.745
And what exactly
are we all about die for?

35:13.779 --> 35:16.215
That can't be him!

35:16.248 --> 35:17.383
What the hell's going on here?!

35:17.416 --> 35:19.218
Back up!

35:19.251 --> 35:20.319
What's going on here?!

35:20.352 --> 35:21.653
I'll see you in hell.

35:21.687 --> 35:23.355
BRODY: End of the line, kids!

35:23.389 --> 35:25.857
Everybody get down, get down!

35:25.891 --> 35:27.193
Police! Get down!

35:27.226 --> 35:28.194
Put your weapons away!

35:28.227 --> 35:30.529
BRODY: Drop your weapons!
Drop your weapons!

35:30.562 --> 35:31.763
Down!

35:31.797 --> 35:33.332
LASALLE:
Hey! Drop your weapons!

35:38.204 --> 35:40.706
I got the one who shot me!

35:43.475 --> 35:44.776
You're coming with me.

35:44.810 --> 35:46.345
MIGUEL:
Found the Excalibur.

35:49.548 --> 35:51.317
And here's what's odd.

35:51.350 --> 35:53.752
This thing isn't in any shape
to blow up anything.

35:53.785 --> 35:55.854
No kidding.

35:55.887 --> 35:57.689
Zed Hastings--

35:57.723 --> 35:59.591
when's the last time
you laid eyes on him?

35:59.625 --> 36:01.493
Before I rushed the house.

36:01.527 --> 36:03.795
We got everyone else
accounted for. Zed is gone.

36:03.829 --> 36:04.963
MIGUEL:
Use the reputation

36:04.996 --> 36:06.865
of a dead man
in order to assemble

36:06.898 --> 36:09.435
the manpower to steal a weapon
you can't use?

36:09.468 --> 36:12.304
What are we missing?

36:15.006 --> 36:17.243
SEBASTIAN:
So the attack on the bridge was
never about the missile itself.

36:17.276 --> 36:19.278
It was about a chip
inside the Excalibur.

36:19.311 --> 36:22.814
Specifically,
a telematics guidance chip.

36:22.848 --> 36:24.850
You remember
how we couldn't

36:24.883 --> 36:27.319
track the missile 'cause we just
assumed that the GPS system

36:27.353 --> 36:28.954
had been taken offline?
Well, I don't think

36:28.987 --> 36:30.822
it was taken offline
so much as it was...

36:30.856 --> 36:32.891
Stolen?
Snuffleupagus.

36:32.924 --> 36:36.362
Well, what good is the chip
without the missile?

36:36.395 --> 36:37.763
Well, think of it
like a cell phone,

36:37.796 --> 36:39.898
all right?
If you steal my cell phone,

36:39.931 --> 36:41.633
then you have access
to all my contacts,

36:41.667 --> 36:43.302
as well as a bunch
of horrifying selfies

36:43.335 --> 36:44.403
I took on a roller coaster.

36:44.436 --> 36:46.238
But if it was the U.S. Navy...

36:46.272 --> 36:48.240
Then my contacts
on the telematics

36:48.274 --> 36:50.342
would give you access to
the whereabouts and activities

36:50.376 --> 36:52.478
of almost every military asset
that we have.

36:52.511 --> 36:54.280
It's a seven-figure
windfall if you could

36:54.313 --> 36:55.714
sell it
to one of our enemies.

36:55.747 --> 36:56.915
You think this Zed guy's got it?

36:56.948 --> 36:58.717
No. Zed was stuck
in the compound,

36:58.750 --> 37:01.920
bluffing that he was
about to bomb the Navy.

37:01.953 --> 37:03.955
So he's the diversion.
Allowing someone
else to walk away

37:03.989 --> 37:05.957
with the telematics chip.

37:05.991 --> 37:09.261
Someone else, like who?

37:09.295 --> 37:11.263
Dental records confirm

37:11.297 --> 37:13.632
the body found
at the compound was in fact

37:13.665 --> 37:16.268
"The Father" Brant Boudreau.

37:16.302 --> 37:17.936
Dead how long?

37:17.969 --> 37:20.772
Based on standard
decomp rates, dampness,

37:20.806 --> 37:22.408
I'd say a year.

37:22.441 --> 37:24.310
Before recruitment started.

37:24.343 --> 37:25.611
Cause of death?

37:25.644 --> 37:26.612
Gunshot wound to the head.

37:26.645 --> 37:27.779
Bullet entered here,

37:27.813 --> 37:29.615
exited at the right temple.

37:29.648 --> 37:32.318
I was able to retrieve
a fragment of it,

37:32.351 --> 37:36.288
and Sebastian
suggests it's a .380 ACP.

37:36.322 --> 37:38.924
That caliber
works with Bersa Thunder.

37:38.957 --> 37:42.294
And we've seen
that weapon recently.

37:51.102 --> 37:53.705
$600 room in a
Nassau hotel?

37:53.739 --> 37:56.041
Who's paying?

37:56.074 --> 37:58.410
Russians?

37:58.444 --> 38:00.446
Pakistanis?

38:02.581 --> 38:05.417
Got our suspect.

38:13.592 --> 38:15.527
And our asset.

38:15.561 --> 38:18.764
Sit.

38:18.797 --> 38:20.466
How'd you find me?

38:20.499 --> 38:22.468
Your friend Zed.

38:22.501 --> 38:24.703
One you were so scared of.

38:24.736 --> 38:26.438
Had a ticket to the Bahamas.

38:26.472 --> 38:27.706
Didn't pick it up.

38:27.739 --> 38:31.410
My guess, he's
on the run.

38:31.443 --> 38:33.812
Well, you won't catch him.

38:33.845 --> 38:34.980
Caught you.

38:36.482 --> 38:38.350
Got to ask.

38:38.384 --> 38:40.952
How much were
they gonna pay you, Anna?

38:40.986 --> 38:43.755
You think this is about money?

38:46.592 --> 38:49.661
My ex, he wanted money.

38:49.695 --> 38:51.463
But you know what?

38:51.497 --> 38:54.500
He never even believed a word
that came out of his own mouth.

38:54.533 --> 38:56.435
Is that why you killed him?

38:56.468 --> 38:58.904
He was in the way.

38:58.937 --> 39:01.139
And he couldn't see.

39:01.172 --> 39:02.574
See what?

39:02.608 --> 39:06.144
That the Russians,
the Pakistanis,

39:06.177 --> 39:09.848
the jihadists--
we all have a common enemy:

39:09.881 --> 39:11.082
the U.S. government.

39:11.116 --> 39:13.385
And the busier they keep you,

39:13.419 --> 39:15.954
the easier it is
for us to prevail.

39:15.987 --> 39:18.123
Sic semper tyrannis.

39:18.156 --> 39:20.926
Movements have mothers, too.

39:40.979 --> 39:42.748
No!

39:42.781 --> 39:44.983
You took your money
and bought a bar?

39:45.016 --> 39:47.486
Go big, she told me.

39:49.721 --> 39:52.824
It's kind of a fixer-upper.

39:52.858 --> 39:54.693
New beginnings.

39:54.726 --> 39:56.962
Well, what do
you call it?

39:56.995 --> 39:58.897
CFA.

39:59.965 --> 40:02.067
"Charity for all.

40:02.100 --> 40:03.969
"With malice toward none,

40:04.002 --> 40:05.537
"charity for all,

40:05.571 --> 40:08.707
"let us strive on
to finish the work we are in,

40:08.740 --> 40:09.975
"to bind up

40:10.008 --> 40:12.177
the nation's wounds."

40:12.210 --> 40:16.014
Those who want to tear us apart
quote Booth.

40:16.047 --> 40:17.483
I'll quote Lincoln.

40:17.516 --> 40:20.085
:
It's damn straight.

40:21.687 --> 40:23.855
Lucky for you, King,
you hit me in the Kevlar.

40:23.889 --> 40:25.156
Thank you for that.

40:25.190 --> 40:27.493
'Cause I got a A in shop.

40:27.526 --> 40:28.860
Okay.

40:28.894 --> 40:30.061
I like it.

40:30.095 --> 40:31.196
It's-it's kitschy.

40:31.229 --> 40:33.699
"Kitschy." Is that "ugly"?

40:33.732 --> 40:35.467
Technically, "kitschy"
means something appealing

40:35.501 --> 40:39.137
to lowbrow taste, but in
this case, it means awesome.

40:41.139 --> 40:42.173
Could've been a sexy racehorse.

40:42.207 --> 40:44.643
Guys, where's Percy?

40:44.676 --> 40:46.645
Oh, I sent her for provisions.

40:46.678 --> 40:48.780
And I damn well better
get reimbursed for it, too.

40:48.814 --> 40:50.749
BRODY: Absolutely.
LASALLE:
Oh, we'll get right on that.

40:51.950 --> 40:53.619
Coming in with
some attitude.

40:53.652 --> 40:55.887
Well, let me lighten
that load for you.

40:55.921 --> 40:58.524
Hate to spoil a party,
but we got to talk.

40:59.591 --> 41:00.959
About you.

41:00.992 --> 41:02.994
No secrets.

41:05.196 --> 41:08.066
Found on a dozen militant sites.

41:08.099 --> 41:09.568
Taken on the compound.

41:09.601 --> 41:12.137
My guess, Zed took it.

41:12.170 --> 41:13.204
That's you, King.

41:13.238 --> 41:16.141
They're asking who the cop is.

41:16.174 --> 41:18.544
Took a $50,000 bounty out.

41:21.046 --> 41:22.714
Anyone wants me...

41:23.549 --> 41:25.984
...tell them I'll be right here.

41:26.017 --> 41:27.953
How we doing over there, Mac?

41:27.986 --> 41:30.288
Hey, I'm slaying.

41:30.321 --> 41:32.290
That Dr. John? No.

41:32.323 --> 41:34.092
Sure is.
No, it isn't!

41:34.125 --> 41:35.727
Get out of here!

41:39.164 --> 41:40.766
LASALLE:
Come on, baby.

41:40.799 --> 41:42.701
* I been in the right place

41:42.734 --> 41:45.704
* Must have been
the wrong time *

41:45.737 --> 41:47.773
* I been in the right state

41:47.806 --> 41:50.008
* In the wrong mind

41:50.041 --> 41:52.944
* I been in the right place

41:52.978 --> 41:55.213
* But it was the wrong song

41:55.246 --> 41:59.685
* I been running, trying
to get hung up in my mind *

41:59.718 --> 42:02.220
* Got to give myself

42:02.253 --> 42:05.156
* A little talking to
this time *

42:05.190 --> 42:08.059
* I been in the right place

42:08.093 --> 42:10.095
* But it must have been
the wrong time... *
