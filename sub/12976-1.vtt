Come on!

00:39.672 --> 00:41.006
Come on, move yourself!

00:45.373 --> 00:50.102
<b>DEADLY INTENT</b>

00:50.618 --> 00:53.618
<b>Subrip: Pix</b>

01:51.977 --> 01:54.180
Come on, James.
Time for bed.

02:08.127 --> 02:09.428
Do you want a story?

02:20.305 --> 02:21.940
All right, bed.

02:23.107 --> 02:24.709
You can play again
in the morning.

02:50.268 --> 02:51.669
Sleep tight, tiger.

05:59.058 --> 06:00.793
For god's sake!

06:03.027 --> 06:04.128
Shit.

06:07.298 --> 06:09.967
You're up early.

07:07.493 --> 07:08.893
All right, now,
I'll push it now then.

07:08.894 --> 07:09.627
Yeah.

07:09.628 --> 07:10.761
Here we go.

07:14.332 --> 07:16.534
Push, hold on.

08:56.068 --> 08:57.702
James!

08:57.703 --> 08:59.137
You're getting soaked!

09:06.578 --> 09:07.946
Inside, now!

10:16.748 --> 10:17.882
Come on.

10:19.017 --> 10:20.419
Let's go and get you dry.

10:31.863 --> 10:32.964
James.

10:39.304 --> 10:42.074
God!

11:22.647 --> 11:25.181
My god, what
have you done now?

11:25.182 --> 11:26.617
Nothing!

11:27.786 --> 11:30.888
This thing weighs a tonne,
you could have been hurt!

11:44.469 --> 11:45.771
I'm sorry, James.

11:47.705 --> 11:49.039
I didn't mean to shout.

11:51.743 --> 11:52.710
I just don't understand...

11:52.711 --> 11:54.111
Leave me alone.

11:55.980 --> 11:57.180
Please, James, just talk to...

11:57.181 --> 12:00.317
Leave me alone.

13:09.488 --> 13:12.056
James, I think it's time...

13:23.834 --> 13:25.070
Shit!

13:27.973 --> 13:29.541
My god.

13:39.517 --> 13:42.419
James! James!

13:42.420 --> 13:44.454
Why the hell do you do it?

13:44.455 --> 13:46.022
I didn't do anything!

13:46.023 --> 13:48.092
Well, someone turned
those taps on, James,

13:48.093 --> 13:49.325
and it wasn't me!

13:49.326 --> 13:50.294
I told you, I didn't...

13:51.662 --> 13:54.164
God, you're nearly
gonna get us electrocuted!

13:54.165 --> 13:56.735
How could you be so stupid?

15:07.906 --> 15:09.541
Can you see?

15:11.843 --> 15:13.377
Can I help with that?

15:15.814 --> 15:16.848
No.

15:18.182 --> 15:19.416
Come on.

15:22.586 --> 15:23.954
I could put them away.

15:29.994 --> 15:32.329
Fuck off! Fuck off!

15:33.632 --> 15:35.332
God, I am sorry, I'm sorry!

15:35.333 --> 15:37.469
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.

15:40.839 --> 15:41.873
I'm sorry.

15:52.883 --> 15:54.117
Hi.

15:54.118 --> 15:55.852
I wasn't expecting you.

15:55.853 --> 15:57.253
No.

15:57.254 --> 15:58.756
Of course, if you'd
been here last night

15:58.757 --> 16:00.056
for dad's do, then you'd know

16:00.057 --> 16:01.424
they didn't wanna
leave the house empty

16:01.425 --> 16:02.626
while they're away.

16:02.627 --> 16:06.063
God. I forgot.

16:06.064 --> 16:07.232
You don't say.

16:08.599 --> 16:09.834
Hi, James.

16:16.241 --> 16:17.976
We need to
stay for a few days,

16:17.977 --> 16:21.145
bit of a plumbing problem.

16:21.146 --> 16:22.612
I can take over, if you like.

16:22.613 --> 16:24.314
No way.

16:24.315 --> 16:26.885
I wasn't trying to
kick you out, Lise.

17:48.900 --> 17:50.535
And it's a try!

17:51.436 --> 17:52.237
Come on.

17:52.238 --> 17:53.238
Gonna get back, yeah?

17:53.239 --> 17:54.873
Take you to another match.

17:56.407 --> 17:57.440
Here we go.

17:57.441 --> 17:58.875
Here it comes, where's he going?

17:58.876 --> 18:00.043
He's going!

18:06.985 --> 18:08.219
Come on, mate.

18:15.226 --> 18:19.063
What's up, mate?

18:26.069 --> 18:27.604
How long are
you gonna be away?

18:29.807 --> 18:31.008
Look...

18:32.209 --> 18:34.611
get the job done,
then I'll be back.

18:34.612 --> 18:35.880
Promise.

18:40.718 --> 18:42.151
See that boat over there?

18:42.152 --> 18:43.853
Yeah.

18:43.854 --> 18:46.824
What's that thing sticking
out of the side of it.

18:46.825 --> 18:49.458
Dunno, could be anything.

18:49.459 --> 18:51.461
Looks like it's
sinking though, look.

18:55.432 --> 18:56.632
Want some chips?

18:56.633 --> 18:58.267
Yeah.

18:58.268 --> 18:59.938
Last one there then!

19:00.971 --> 19:01.940
I'm gonna beat you.

19:01.941 --> 19:03.274
James!

19:21.659 --> 19:23.061
Dad!

19:25.363 --> 19:27.230
James!

19:27.231 --> 19:28.631
What were you thinking?

19:28.632 --> 19:30.633
It was dad! I saw him!

19:30.634 --> 19:31.869
You can't have!

19:31.870 --> 19:33.135
I saw him!

19:33.136 --> 19:35.572
For Christ's sake,
James, your dad is dead.

19:54.225 --> 19:55.459
That was a bit brutal.

19:57.862 --> 19:59.229
He has to accept it.

20:00.297 --> 20:02.332
I just don't know how
to get through to him.

20:02.333 --> 20:04.234
Therapist isn't helping then?

20:04.235 --> 20:06.003
Nothing helps.

20:06.004 --> 20:08.471
Have you tried talking to him?

20:08.472 --> 20:09.840
Okay, okay.

20:47.045 --> 20:48.446
I'm sorry, tiger.

20:50.381 --> 20:52.050
I didn't mean to shout earlier.

21:23.081 --> 21:24.448
This is Ollie.

21:24.449 --> 21:26.683
He was mine when I was little.

21:30.321 --> 21:31.990
I loved him very much.

21:35.593 --> 21:40.163
When I was sad, I used
to hug him really close.

22:21.972 --> 22:23.672
Look, I don't want to
interfere or anything...

22:23.673 --> 22:24.741
Then don't.

22:33.284 --> 22:34.752
Listen, lise.

22:36.187 --> 22:38.756
I'm the only parent
James has got,

22:40.057 --> 22:42.359
so the sooner he accepts
that, the better it's gonna be

22:42.360 --> 22:43.594
for both of us.

22:48.032 --> 22:52.036
Honestly, James is fine.

22:54.372 --> 22:55.339
Don't worry.

23:39.749 --> 23:41.017
You okay?

23:44.455 --> 23:45.556
It's fine.

23:50.061 --> 23:51.061
What's the matter?

23:51.062 --> 23:53.263
I need
to do something.

23:53.264 --> 23:54.397
Like what?

23:54.398 --> 23:55.564
Fucking anything,
I don't know.

23:55.565 --> 23:57.300
It's nearly midnight.

24:00.438 --> 24:01.339
Shall I get you a drink?

24:01.340 --> 24:03.006
No, just fucking leave it.

24:41.746 --> 24:43.381
Jesus!

24:44.448 --> 24:45.715
Sorry, couldn't help myself.

24:45.716 --> 24:47.284
Very funny.

24:47.285 --> 24:48.685
I was just trying
to lighten the mood.

24:48.686 --> 24:50.688
For fuck's
sake, grow up, Lisa.

25:30.428 --> 25:34.031
Bryony, you're
gonna be late for work.

25:37.634 --> 25:38.634
What time is it?

25:38.635 --> 25:39.869
It's 8:30.

25:39.870 --> 25:41.072
God.

25:54.317 --> 25:55.518
Thanks, Lise.

26:14.171 --> 26:15.538
Fire!

26:36.259 --> 26:37.427
James!

26:41.998 --> 26:43.834
What the hell have
you been doing?

26:52.709 --> 26:53.978
I'll see you later.

26:55.179 --> 26:56.479
Bye, James.

28:10.921 --> 28:12.055
Hi, James.

28:37.280 --> 28:38.448
Can I see?

28:43.286 --> 28:44.555
Is that your dad?

28:47.690 --> 28:50.161
You know, soldiers
don't just kill people.

28:51.295 --> 28:53.930
Sometimes they try to stop
them from getting hurt.

28:54.998 --> 28:56.933
That's what your dad was
doing last time he was away.

28:58.969 --> 29:00.336
He was angry.

29:02.072 --> 29:05.007
Do you ever think he
might have been sad as well?

29:05.008 --> 29:07.576
Sometimes what soldiers
see makes them sad.

29:07.577 --> 29:11.080
No, not sad. Just angry.

29:20.658 --> 29:21.759
Hi, Lise.

29:27.297 --> 29:28.498
Is this yours?

29:34.238 --> 29:35.605
Why has he done that?

29:40.678 --> 29:41.679
James?

29:43.713 --> 29:45.414
James, open the door!

29:45.415 --> 29:47.116
Try talking to him.

29:49.319 --> 29:52.087
I mean it, James.
Open the door now.

29:52.088 --> 29:54.524
Calm down,
this isn't gonna help.

29:57.495 --> 29:59.263
James.

30:02.266 --> 30:04.000
I need to talk to you.

30:08.939 --> 30:10.306
Please, James.

30:12.843 --> 30:16.212
Leave him. He
can't stay in there forever.

31:21.511 --> 31:22.946
James?

31:22.947 --> 31:26.083
Your dinner's nearly ready,
I want you downstairs now.

31:48.771 --> 31:51.474
Sorry I didn't eat much, but...

31:58.248 --> 31:59.516
James!

32:01.184 --> 32:03.152
Come on, James, your
mum's really worried.

32:24.941 --> 32:28.710
James, you
can't cut me out like this.

32:28.711 --> 32:29.946
Look at me.

32:29.947 --> 32:32.782
Look at me. Why did
you bury my bear?

32:32.783 --> 32:34.417
Dad doesn't like girly toys.

32:34.418 --> 32:36.453
Didn't like. Your
dad's gone, James.

32:36.454 --> 32:39.154
No! He's watching me.

32:39.155 --> 32:41.958
You said was watching
me from heaven.

32:41.959 --> 32:43.392
Maybe I did say that...

32:43.393 --> 32:46.929
Soldiers keep us safe
by killing the bad people.

32:46.930 --> 32:48.899
That's right, isn't it.

33:01.478 --> 33:03.714
Hurry up, I can't
be late again!

33:08.052 --> 33:10.020
Come on, can't leave you here.

33:10.021 --> 33:11.254
Yeah, you can.

33:11.255 --> 33:12.889
I can teach him how
to make explosives

33:12.890 --> 33:14.856
from easily obtainable
household ingredients.

33:14.857 --> 33:15.758
What?

33:15.759 --> 33:17.125
Just go, we'll be fine.

33:17.126 --> 33:18.361
Are you sure?

33:19.863 --> 33:21.398
Shit!

33:24.968 --> 33:26.401
How could he?

33:26.402 --> 33:28.603
No way, I've just
come up, they weren't there.

33:28.604 --> 33:29.939
They must have been.

33:29.940 --> 33:32.574
I think I
might have noticed.

33:32.575 --> 33:34.610
That's lethal, he
could have killed me.

33:34.611 --> 33:36.179
It wasn't James, it
couldn't have been.

33:36.180 --> 33:37.546
It must have been.

33:37.547 --> 33:39.048
It can't have been.

33:46.690 --> 33:47.789
What are you doing?

33:47.790 --> 33:48.524
I'm calling in sick.

33:48.525 --> 33:49.459
Why?

33:49.460 --> 33:50.493
I can't leave you with this.

33:50.494 --> 33:51.760
With what?

33:51.761 --> 33:53.395
With James, god knows
what he's gonna do next.

33:53.396 --> 33:55.163
I told you, it wasn't James.

33:55.164 --> 33:57.400
Look, just go, we'll be fine.

33:57.401 --> 33:59.235
No, I'm not happy
leaving you here.

33:59.236 --> 34:01.437
Bryony, you need
to go to work.

34:01.438 --> 34:02.573
Just go.

34:03.707 --> 34:04.975
Go! Come on.

34:55.859 --> 34:57.693
Hi, Mike.

34:57.694 --> 35:00.496
Yeah, yeah, I'm good, thank you.

35:00.497 --> 35:04.666
Yeah, actually, I
was just wondering

35:04.667 --> 35:07.703
if there was any chance I
could borrow some of your kit.

35:16.446 --> 35:17.445
Hi.

35:17.446 --> 35:18.548
Hiya.

35:19.917 --> 35:21.550
So?

35:21.551 --> 35:22.918
So what?

35:22.919 --> 35:24.287
So how's he been?

35:24.288 --> 35:25.854
Yeah, fine.

35:25.855 --> 35:27.657
Hasn't murdered
anyone that I know of.

35:27.658 --> 35:29.926
No, don't joke about it.

35:32.696 --> 35:34.764
So, what's he been up to?

35:34.765 --> 35:37.166
He has been helping me.

35:37.167 --> 35:38.700
After the marbles this morning,

35:38.701 --> 35:41.771
I thought we better be prepared.

35:41.772 --> 35:42.573
What?

35:42.574 --> 35:44.039
Do you wanna see?

35:44.040 --> 35:44.774
Okay.

35:44.775 --> 35:45.808
Come on then.

35:50.913 --> 35:52.581
My god.

35:52.582 --> 35:53.782
It's great, isn't it.

35:53.783 --> 35:54.816
James helped me set it up.

35:54.817 --> 35:55.918
For Christ's sake,

35:55.919 --> 35:57.320
this is the last thing he needs.

35:57.321 --> 35:59.921
Come on, kids love
this sort of stuff.

35:59.922 --> 36:03.326
Listen, Lise, he's
not like a normal kid.

36:05.161 --> 36:07.863
He doesn't need any
more crap to deal with.

36:07.864 --> 36:10.833
True, but if it is crap,

36:10.834 --> 36:12.736
then he won't have to
deal with it will he?

37:07.524 --> 37:08.792
Shit!

37:12.663 --> 37:13.896
My god!

37:13.897 --> 37:15.664
Why does he do these things?

37:15.665 --> 37:17.166
You don't
know it was James.

37:17.167 --> 37:18.601
Of course it was.

37:18.602 --> 37:20.403
Yeah, but look,
its not smashed.

37:20.404 --> 37:22.972
It's like it's melted.

37:22.973 --> 37:25.108
I so don't need this.

37:37.187 --> 37:39.956
Good morning, sleepyhead.

37:39.957 --> 37:41.724
Do you want some breakfast?

37:41.725 --> 37:42.992
What is it?

37:42.993 --> 37:44.594
We've got cereal,

37:46.062 --> 37:48.864
toast, porridge?

37:49.799 --> 37:51.733
Well, what do you want then?

37:51.734 --> 37:53.401
Can I have some of that?

37:53.402 --> 37:55.439
Yeah, go on then.
Grab out a plate.

38:05.015 --> 38:07.115
Have you tried cooking?

38:07.116 --> 38:08.819
You should, you'd love it.

38:10.853 --> 38:12.488
Dad made really good curries.

38:12.489 --> 38:13.990
Yeah? Nice.

38:13.991 --> 38:16.826
Promised he would teach
me when I was older.

38:18.361 --> 38:19.930
Promised lots of things.

38:34.310 --> 38:35.578
Here, have a big bit.

38:36.747 --> 38:37.948
Thanks.

38:47.757 --> 38:49.393
You're not going back, are you?

38:53.596 --> 38:56.299
No, son. I'm not
going anywhere.

39:03.540 --> 39:05.375
Hate it when you
leave me behind.

39:13.783 --> 39:16.318
You're the only good
thing to come out this mess.

39:16.319 --> 39:17.721
Dad?

39:19.122 --> 39:22.325
No, son, I won't be
going anywhere, I promise.

39:55.892 --> 39:56.892
What is that?

39:56.893 --> 39:58.827
Hi James.

39:58.828 --> 40:00.662
It's a dream catcher.

40:00.663 --> 40:01.598
A what?

40:01.599 --> 40:03.131
A dream catcher.

40:03.132 --> 40:05.200
The Native Americans used them.

40:05.201 --> 40:06.602
But what's it for?

40:08.004 --> 40:10.606
To trap evil spirits.

40:10.607 --> 40:11.807
How?

40:11.808 --> 40:13.743
Dunno, just think
it looks cool.

40:24.453 --> 40:26.155
James?

40:26.156 --> 40:28.125
Lisa?

40:32.194 --> 40:33.429
It is him.

40:33.430 --> 40:34.230
What?

40:34.231 --> 40:35.731
It is James.

40:35.732 --> 40:36.932
I told you!

40:36.933 --> 40:38.300
No no no, not
like that though.

40:38.301 --> 40:40.237
I don't think he even
knows he's doing it.

40:40.238 --> 40:41.470
How do you mean?

40:41.471 --> 40:45.206
Okay, this morning
we were at breakfast

40:45.207 --> 40:47.575
and James got upset,
and then suddenly

40:47.576 --> 40:50.013
all the cutlery just jumped
off the draining board.

40:51.681 --> 40:52.881
By itself?

40:52.882 --> 40:54.883
Yeah, he scared
the crap out of me.

40:54.884 --> 40:56.952
So, what are you saying?

40:56.953 --> 40:58.220
I dunno exactly.

40:58.221 --> 41:00.657
Look, James didn't do
anything physically

41:00.658 --> 41:02.024
but I'll swear it was him.

41:03.225 --> 41:06.461
So, you didn't actually
see him wave a wand

41:06.462 --> 41:08.396
and shout, "Leviosa!".

41:08.397 --> 41:10.865
I'm not making it up.

41:10.866 --> 41:13.401
All this stuff James
has been going through,

41:13.402 --> 41:16.037
all these emotions,
maybe he's bottling them up

41:16.038 --> 41:17.472
like volcano, and...

41:17.473 --> 41:19.675
All that leaves
whatever's happened, it's real.

41:19.676 --> 41:21.376
Exactly, this is real.

41:21.377 --> 41:23.244
I read this article
about this woman

41:23.245 --> 41:25.847
and every time she got upset,
all the fuses in her house

41:25.848 --> 41:27.983
just blew out.

41:27.984 --> 41:30.052
Children have very
powerful psyches and...

41:30.053 --> 41:32.488
Cut it out, Lise.

41:32.489 --> 41:34.689
You're not a child psychologist.

41:34.690 --> 41:37.060
You're not even a proper
teacher for god's sake.

41:40.529 --> 41:41.698
No.

41:43.165 --> 41:45.067
No, I'm a teaching assistant.

41:47.671 --> 41:50.572
My job may not impress anyone

41:50.573 --> 41:52.942
but at least I'm
not ashamed of it.

42:24.107 --> 42:25.742
Right then,
tiger. Time for bed.

42:27.877 --> 42:28.777
Come on.

42:32.047 --> 42:33.749
James, please don't start.

42:33.750 --> 42:36.084
I'm not
going up there.

42:36.085 --> 42:38.186
Auntie, can I sleep
with you tonight?

42:38.187 --> 42:40.222
No, of course you can't.

42:40.223 --> 42:41.291
Please, auntie.

42:41.292 --> 42:42.490
You heard your mum, James.

42:42.491 --> 42:44.026
Come on, now.

42:44.027 --> 42:45.693
Come on, James.

42:45.694 --> 42:46.961
I don't wanna go.

42:46.962 --> 42:48.063
Please, auntie.

42:48.064 --> 42:49.199
I don't wanna go up there!

42:49.200 --> 42:50.200
It's time for bed.

42:50.201 --> 42:51.367
Please, auntie!

42:51.368 --> 42:52.367
Please!

42:52.368 --> 42:53.534
Give me your hand.

42:53.535 --> 42:55.003
Get off, I don't wanna go.

42:55.004 --> 42:55.971
Get off me!

42:55.972 --> 42:57.639
You have to go to bed, James!

42:57.640 --> 42:58.807
Get off, get off.

42:58.808 --> 43:00.043
I hate you!

43:05.348 --> 43:07.984
Why do you do this
to me every time?

43:15.658 --> 43:18.294
James, come
on, I'll take you up.

43:20.730 --> 43:21.731
Come on.

44:04.306 --> 44:06.009
All clear, not a thing.

44:15.018 --> 44:18.019
You know, James,
nothing can hurt you

44:18.020 --> 44:19.589
when you're tucked
up in your bed.

44:21.957 --> 44:24.226
Sleep tight, I'll see
you in the morning.

44:49.118 --> 44:50.252
Don't, Lise.

44:51.353 --> 44:52.588
I didn't say anything.

44:52.589 --> 44:53.789
You don't have
to say anything,

44:53.790 --> 44:55.458
I know what you're thinking.

44:55.459 --> 44:56.792
Really?

45:16.879 --> 45:17.680
Look, Bryony, I just...

45:17.681 --> 45:19.648
Just leave it, Lise.

45:19.649 --> 45:21.682
Because
that's better, is it?

45:21.683 --> 45:24.787
Pretending everything's okay?

45:24.788 --> 45:27.923
Sometimes
life is cruel,

45:27.924 --> 45:32.059
and hateful, and there's nothing

45:32.060 --> 45:33.295
you can do about it.

45:33.296 --> 45:34.530
Well, maybe not,

45:34.531 --> 45:36.032
but you don't have to
let it destroy you.

45:36.033 --> 45:37.800
It's my fault, is it?

45:37.801 --> 45:39.936
Well, look at yourself,
Bryony, you're a wreck.

45:41.770 --> 45:44.006
James needs you,
can't you see that?

46:14.404 --> 46:16.105
It's okay, tiger.

46:17.873 --> 46:20.309
I think you've just
been sleepwalking.

46:20.310 --> 46:22.644
I saw something.

46:22.645 --> 46:24.345
Auntie, I saw something!

46:24.346 --> 46:25.948
It's okay, James.

46:28.484 --> 46:30.118
Maybe it was just a dream.

46:31.154 --> 46:32.387
Come on, let's get
you back to bed.

46:32.388 --> 46:33.823
No!

46:43.332 --> 46:45.834
Do you want auntie Lisa
to take you back to bed?

47:13.962 --> 47:15.163
You're right.

47:17.901 --> 47:20.236
I'm a rotten mother
and a crap sister.

47:21.471 --> 47:23.673
And there were times
when I needed a sister.

47:28.911 --> 47:29.946
Me too.

47:39.254 --> 47:40.957
I've told you, you're
not going anywhere.

47:44.160 --> 47:46.261
How can I look after you
both if you're not here?

47:50.033 --> 47:51.768
I'm sorry, Steve.

47:58.607 --> 48:00.142
You both need me.

48:08.551 --> 48:10.219
I'm sorry, Steve.

48:12.522 --> 48:14.690
I can't go on like
this any more.

48:20.562 --> 48:21.964
Fuck off then, go.

48:25.667 --> 48:26.935
Go on, fuck off.

48:38.013 --> 48:39.680
You're not taking my boy.

48:39.681 --> 48:42.417
You are not taking my
boy, you fucking bitch.

48:49.359 --> 48:50.660
Come here.

48:58.533 --> 48:59.602
I'm sorry I...

49:07.377 --> 49:08.911
You still don't get it, do you.

49:11.047 --> 49:12.982
This is what sisters are for.

49:39.509 --> 49:42.545
It's as though
he blames me for everything.

49:42.546 --> 49:44.246
Well, you're here.

49:44.247 --> 49:45.982
He can't take it out on Steve.

49:50.319 --> 49:51.788
Does he have any friends?

49:55.558 --> 49:57.694
He's not much good
at friends any more.

49:59.227 --> 50:01.096
Friends don't have
to be other kids.

50:02.931 --> 50:05.134
Who was my best
friend when I was 10?

50:15.078 --> 50:16.411
James?

50:23.118 --> 50:24.252
Here...

50:26.989 --> 50:28.222
do you like him?

50:28.223 --> 50:29.124
No.

50:29.125 --> 50:32.526
Come on, he's so cute!

50:32.527 --> 50:35.630
He needs someone
to look after him.

50:35.631 --> 50:37.700
Do you wanna hold him?

50:44.573 --> 50:47.109
Hey, that tickles.

50:47.210 --> 50:48.578
He's gonna need a name.

50:50.312 --> 50:51.646
Frodo.

50:51.647 --> 50:53.648
Why Frodo?

50:53.649 --> 50:55.884
Look, hairy feet.

51:40.363 --> 51:43.331
Auntie, can Frodo
live in your room?

51:43.332 --> 51:45.767
My room? I thought
you liked him.

51:45.768 --> 51:47.034
I do.

51:47.035 --> 51:48.970
Then why do you want
him to live in here?

51:48.971 --> 51:51.907
I just think he'd
be safer with you.

51:51.908 --> 51:54.041
Right
then, see you later.

51:54.042 --> 51:55.677
Be good for your auntie, okay?

51:55.678 --> 51:57.113
Bye!

51:59.582 --> 52:03.017
What were you expecting
to see with the camera?

52:03.018 --> 52:05.320
Dunno, just
thought it'd be cool

52:05.321 --> 52:06.822
if we saw something weird.

52:06.823 --> 52:09.490
So, you do believe
there's something.

52:09.491 --> 52:10.926
Do you?

52:12.395 --> 52:14.597
I believe there are a lot
of things in this world

52:14.598 --> 52:15.698
we don't understand.

52:16.765 --> 52:18.800
What if they're bad things?

52:18.801 --> 52:21.802
There are no bad
things, only our fears.

52:21.803 --> 52:23.537
And I think the
best thing to do,

52:23.538 --> 52:26.575
if we're afraid of something,
is to go straight up to it

52:26.576 --> 52:30.279
and look it right in the
eye, don't you think?

52:32.948 --> 52:33.982
James?

52:48.897 --> 52:51.366
James? You hungry yet?

52:56.439 --> 52:57.506
James?

53:09.484 --> 53:11.086
Hello?

53:12.388 --> 53:13.288
What?

53:14.390 --> 53:16.292
Hey, slow down.

53:18.761 --> 53:19.862
What?

53:25.201 --> 53:26.668
I've
searched everywhere.

53:26.669 --> 53:28.237
When did you last see him?

53:28.238 --> 53:29.671
Was he upset?

53:29.672 --> 53:32.842
He seemed fine, but, you
better see for yourself.

53:42.218 --> 53:44.218
What the hell is this?

53:44.219 --> 53:47.390
It's my fault, I told him
he needs to face his fears.

53:49.725 --> 53:50.960
My god.

53:53.194 --> 53:55.297
I think he's trying
to protect himself.

53:57.098 --> 54:00.870
My poor boy.
He's terrified.

54:03.571 --> 54:05.407
Why didn't I see this?

54:05.408 --> 54:06.708
Honestly, I have
looked everywhere.

54:06.709 --> 54:08.242
I don't see how he
could have got out,

54:08.243 --> 54:10.477
all the doors are locked.

54:10.478 --> 54:12.181
And the windows?

54:13.281 --> 54:14.216
Shall we call the police?

54:14.217 --> 54:14.951
No!

54:14.952 --> 54:15.751
Why not?

54:15.752 --> 54:17.151
Are you joking?

54:17.152 --> 54:18.686
Everyone thinks I'm a
train wreck. If they see...

54:18.687 --> 54:21.121
Well, is there
anywhere he'd go?

54:21.122 --> 54:22.856
How? You said all
the doors are locked.

54:22.857 --> 54:24.059
Well, they are.

54:24.060 --> 54:25.193
Then he's gotta
be here somewhere.

54:25.194 --> 54:27.330
James? James?

54:30.031 --> 54:31.232
Where is he?

55:15.810 --> 55:16.911
James?

55:37.198 --> 55:38.500
Is that you, James?

55:45.241 --> 55:46.642
James?

55:51.747 --> 55:54.048
Make it stop,
make it stop, make it stop.

55:54.049 --> 55:56.284
Make it stop, I don't like it.

55:56.285 --> 55:58.920
It's okay, I'm here.

55:58.921 --> 56:00.921
Make it stop.

56:00.922 --> 56:05.060
Hey, make what stop?

56:06.294 --> 56:11.032
Sometimes I hear things,
it's like they're in my head.

56:11.033 --> 56:14.235
And sometimes things
happen, like the bookcase

56:14.236 --> 56:16.336
but you never believed me!

56:16.337 --> 56:18.506
I do believe you. God.

56:20.241 --> 56:21.410
I'm so sorry.

56:22.444 --> 56:24.212
God, I should have
listened to you.

56:32.654 --> 56:35.490
I've not been much good
lately, I know that.

56:38.426 --> 56:41.863
But I do love you, and
you must know one thing,

56:41.864 --> 56:45.000
I will never ever let
anything hurt you.

56:56.911 --> 56:59.681
Spiders, needles,

57:01.350 --> 57:03.152
being all alone.

57:04.819 --> 57:06.588
That's mine, done.

57:09.257 --> 57:11.992
When I was little and
I used to get scared,

57:11.993 --> 57:14.062
this is what me and
your grandad used to do.

57:16.498 --> 57:18.433
Okay, your turn.

57:20.768 --> 57:21.802
I can put anything?

57:21.803 --> 57:23.138
Anything you like.

57:49.964 --> 57:51.332
You haven't forgotten anything?

57:53.067 --> 57:54.136
Okay.

59:09.410 --> 59:10.778
It wasn't me!

59:10.779 --> 59:12.947
I know, I know.

59:12.948 --> 59:14.984
What was it, mum?

59:16.051 --> 59:18.586
I dunno, honey.

59:18.587 --> 59:20.054
You felt it?

59:20.055 --> 59:21.790
Yeah. I felt it.

59:23.459 --> 59:24.892
What is it?

59:24.893 --> 59:28.329
All I know is
there must be an explanation,

59:28.330 --> 59:30.299
and we'll find it somehow.

59:37.605 --> 59:40.508
No, I told you,
it's only when he gets upset.

59:41.542 --> 59:44.479
He was having a nightmare,
you heard the scream.

59:44.480 --> 59:46.282
But I'm still not convinced
that that's the reason.

59:46.283 --> 59:47.749
It's obvious.

59:47.750 --> 59:50.686
Look, some people have more
psychic energy than others.

59:50.687 --> 59:54.021
In some cultures it's
considered quite natural.

59:54.022 --> 59:56.590
But if James is causing
these things to happen,

59:56.591 --> 59:57.791
how do we stop him?

59:57.792 --> 01:00:00.695
No, we can't. It
has to come from him.

01:00:00.696 --> 01:00:01.930
He has to learn...

01:00:03.399 --> 01:00:04.333
Hello, you.

01:00:17.846 --> 01:00:21.583
James, you know all this
stuff that's been happening?

01:00:21.584 --> 01:00:24.284
Have you noticed it's
only when you're upset?

01:00:24.285 --> 01:00:27.555
Look, do you ever feel
any sort of energy?

01:00:27.556 --> 01:00:28.691
You think it was me?

01:00:28.692 --> 01:00:30.892
No, no one's blaming you.

01:00:30.893 --> 01:00:32.427
No, it's not a bad thing.

01:00:32.428 --> 01:00:33.795
Think of it as
something special.

01:00:33.796 --> 01:00:34.896
But I didn't do anything.

01:00:34.897 --> 01:00:36.229
We know you didn't.

01:00:36.230 --> 01:00:37.465
You need to see it as a gift.

01:00:37.466 --> 01:00:38.999
All right.

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:40.668
Just trying to help.

01:00:40.669 --> 01:00:43.272
So, what do you
wanna do today?

01:00:44.939 --> 01:00:46.374
Can we go out somewhere?

01:00:46.375 --> 01:00:47.575
Yeah, I guess.

01:00:47.576 --> 01:00:49.078
Probably something
on for half term.

01:00:53.047 --> 01:00:54.881
You do know what his
means though, Bryony?

01:00:54.882 --> 01:00:56.351
What?

01:00:56.352 --> 01:00:59.086
We're gonna have to be
really nice to him all day

01:00:59.087 --> 01:01:00.621
in case he gets upset.

01:01:00.622 --> 01:01:01.856
You're teasing me.

01:01:01.857 --> 01:01:03.425
Yeah, you're
right, I am teasing you.

01:01:03.426 --> 01:01:05.760
I mustn't, you might make
all the lights go out.

01:01:05.761 --> 01:01:06.695
Mum!

01:01:08.129 --> 01:01:10.298
Sorry, James. No more teasing.

01:01:10.299 --> 01:01:12.901
From now on, you get
my proper respect.

01:01:16.872 --> 01:01:18.773
How about that?

01:01:18.774 --> 01:01:20.909
Yeah, cool.

01:01:31.085 --> 01:01:32.520
Where's he gone?

01:01:49.004 --> 01:01:51.239
Here, try bending this.

01:01:52.540 --> 01:01:53.974
No, not like that!

01:01:53.975 --> 01:01:55.575
Use your mind.

01:01:55.576 --> 01:01:57.946
I keep telling you,
I can't do anything.

01:02:01.350 --> 01:02:02.785
You're nuts, you are.

01:02:06.754 --> 01:02:10.090
I'm just envious, I've
always wanted to be psychic.

01:02:10.091 --> 01:02:12.693
Mind, I did know my last
boyfriend was cheating on me.

01:02:12.694 --> 01:02:14.262
But how cool would it have been

01:02:14.263 --> 01:02:16.899
if I could have made the
ceiling fall down on him.

01:02:18.100 --> 01:02:19.367
Don't abuse it though,

01:02:19.368 --> 01:02:21.570
you mustn't become
a bully or anything.

01:02:21.571 --> 01:02:24.805
Only use it for good, like Yoda.

01:02:24.806 --> 01:02:28.176
May the force be with you!

01:03:00.808 --> 01:03:03.011
Told you it wasn't me.

01:03:04.480 --> 01:03:05.445
We need to call the police.

01:03:05.446 --> 01:03:06.180
No.

01:03:06.181 --> 01:03:07.082
What?

01:03:07.083 --> 01:03:08.316
No, the police can't help.

01:03:08.317 --> 01:03:09.084
Why not?

01:03:09.085 --> 01:03:10.018
I'm scared.

01:03:10.019 --> 01:03:11.452
It's all right, sweetheart.

01:03:11.453 --> 01:03:12.854
Nothing's gonna
hurt you, I promise.

01:03:12.855 --> 01:03:14.389
Lise, take him up to bed.

01:03:14.390 --> 01:03:15.523
No, what if it's...

01:03:15.524 --> 01:03:16.458
No, it's all
right, sweetheart,

01:03:16.459 --> 01:03:18.992
it's just a mess. That's all.

01:03:18.993 --> 01:03:20.193
But I don't...

01:03:20.194 --> 01:03:21.462
Let's do as your
mum says, come on.

01:04:36.038 --> 01:04:37.639
Where's James?

01:04:40.142 --> 01:04:42.008
Steve I was... I
was gonna make...

01:04:42.009 --> 01:04:43.210
Where is he.

01:04:44.413 --> 01:04:46.280
He's not here.

01:04:46.281 --> 01:04:48.316
Where's my fucking boy!

01:04:48.317 --> 01:04:51.385
Where's my fucking boy,
you bitch? Where is he?

01:04:51.386 --> 01:04:52.988
Where's my boy!

01:04:55.290 --> 01:04:56.658
At my dad's.

01:04:58.192 --> 01:05:00.728
You shouldn't have
fucking taken my boy!

01:05:28.823 --> 01:05:30.257
Bryony, what are you doing?

01:05:31.493 --> 01:05:32.960
I need to do something.

01:05:34.129 --> 01:05:36.229
But a ouija board?

01:05:36.230 --> 01:05:38.834
It's Steve. He's here.

01:05:40.035 --> 01:05:42.135
Bryony this, this
is a really bad idea.

01:05:42.136 --> 01:05:44.537
I have to
do something, Lise.

01:05:44.538 --> 01:05:48.377
So, am I doing it by myself,
or are you doing it with me?

01:06:00.489 --> 01:06:03.558
Steve? Are you there?

01:06:11.933 --> 01:06:14.102
Is there something
you want to tell me?

01:06:22.544 --> 01:06:24.379
Is there something
you want me to do?

01:06:27.815 --> 01:06:28.649
I don't think...

01:06:29.817 --> 01:06:31.751
Sorry.

01:06:31.752 --> 01:06:32.953
Steve?

01:06:39.794 --> 01:06:40.895
This is ridiculous.

01:07:00.681 --> 01:07:02.215
This is no joke
any more, Bryony,

01:07:02.216 --> 01:07:03.984
you've got to get
away from here.

01:07:05.386 --> 01:07:08.255
What's the point? You
can't run away from a ghost.

01:07:08.256 --> 01:07:10.023
Well, how do you know?
Maybe he's just here.

01:07:10.024 --> 01:07:13.026
No, he's here
because we're here.

01:07:13.027 --> 01:07:15.163
If we run away, he'll follow us.

01:07:17.732 --> 01:07:19.167
Just like before.

01:07:24.071 --> 01:07:25.140
James!

01:07:41.556 --> 01:07:43.091
How's the pizza?

01:07:44.593 --> 01:07:45.761
It's fine.

01:07:48.363 --> 01:07:49.563
They only had pepperoni,

01:07:49.564 --> 01:07:51.165
they didn't have
ham and mushroom.

01:07:57.739 --> 01:07:59.407
Won't matter what your mum did.

01:08:03.044 --> 01:08:05.547
Didn't even have a
chance to say goodbye.

01:08:14.122 --> 01:08:15.422
Come on, drink up.

01:08:18.626 --> 01:08:19.560
I'm not thirsty.

01:08:20.662 --> 01:08:22.397
Go on, son, get it down you.

01:08:37.444 --> 01:08:38.678
It tastes weird.

01:08:38.679 --> 01:08:40.613
It's what
all us soldiers drink.

01:08:40.613 --> 01:08:42.149
It'll make you big and strong.

01:08:46.354 --> 01:08:47.522
That's it.

01:08:59.300 --> 01:09:01.902
Am I gonna be
staying with you now?

01:09:01.903 --> 01:09:05.674
Yeah. Told you,
you and me forever.

01:09:07.709 --> 01:09:08.910
Not here though.

01:09:12.046 --> 01:09:13.814
There's nothing for
us here any more.

01:09:19.787 --> 01:09:21.988
What about mum?

01:09:21.988 --> 01:09:24.626
Don't worry about her,
she can look after herself.

01:09:28.095 --> 01:09:29.696
You all right, son?

01:09:29.697 --> 01:09:30.997
I feel funny.

01:09:33.635 --> 01:09:35.136
Just close your eyes.

01:09:36.871 --> 01:09:38.906
I'll get in the back with you,
and then you can have a nap.

01:09:41.175 --> 01:09:42.509
All be better soon.

01:10:33.361 --> 01:10:34.528
God.

01:10:40.801 --> 01:10:41.937
No!

01:10:43.638 --> 01:10:44.738
James!

01:11:03.190 --> 01:11:05.260
Jesus.

01:11:08.929 --> 01:11:10.063
Are you hurt?

01:11:10.064 --> 01:11:11.332
No.

01:11:18.672 --> 01:11:20.841
James, what
happened to Frodo?

01:11:23.010 --> 01:11:25.111
He said I could
take him with me.

01:11:25.112 --> 01:11:26.046
Who did?

01:11:26.047 --> 01:11:27.481
I don't know!

01:11:27.482 --> 01:11:29.016
He was in my head.

01:11:29.017 --> 01:11:31.451
He said I had to go now, but
I could take Frodo with me.

01:11:31.452 --> 01:11:33.419
You mustn't listen to him!

01:11:33.420 --> 01:11:35.388
I don't
understand! What's happening?

01:11:35.389 --> 01:11:36.190
We're leaving.

01:11:36.191 --> 01:11:37.024
Now?

01:11:37.025 --> 01:11:38.225
Right now.

01:11:43.098 --> 01:11:45.432
I don't understand,
why won't it open?

01:11:45.433 --> 01:11:47.101
God.

01:11:47.102 --> 01:11:48.470
Try the back door.

01:11:54.341 --> 01:11:55.710
Why won't it open?

01:11:56.911 --> 01:11:57.879
Stand back.

01:12:04.586 --> 01:12:06.287
God.

01:12:11.960 --> 01:12:12.993
Mum.

01:12:15.596 --> 01:12:16.730
It's okay, James.

01:12:20.934 --> 01:12:22.369
What's that noise?

01:12:22.370 --> 01:12:23.805
He's getting stronger.

01:12:23.806 --> 01:12:24.972
Who is?

01:12:57.671 --> 01:12:59.006
Come on.

01:13:12.854 --> 01:13:15.023
It's okay, here.

01:13:33.073 --> 01:13:34.509
Hurry up, Lisa!

01:13:46.955 --> 01:13:47.921
Mum!

01:13:47.922 --> 01:13:50.022
Bryony!

01:13:50.023 --> 01:13:51.258
Are you okay, mum?

01:13:53.694 --> 01:13:56.263
James! No!

01:13:56.264 --> 01:13:57.465
James!

01:13:59.267 --> 01:14:01.635
No! James!

01:14:02.703 --> 01:14:04.205
James, hold on!

01:14:08.876 --> 01:14:11.078
James! Bryony!

01:14:21.389 --> 01:14:22.991
Mum, help me!

01:14:27.060 --> 01:14:28.162
Auntie.

01:14:31.032 --> 01:14:34.300
Mum! Mum!

01:14:34.301 --> 01:14:36.036
Mum!

01:14:39.239 --> 01:14:40.073
Mum!

01:14:40.074 --> 01:14:40.974
James?

01:14:42.242 --> 01:14:43.377
James!

01:14:51.419 --> 01:14:53.153
Leave James, please!

01:14:54.688 --> 01:14:55.789
Dad?

01:14:55.790 --> 01:14:57.958
Steve, stop this!

01:14:57.959 --> 01:14:59.827
Please, let him go.

01:15:09.571 --> 01:15:12.505
If you do this, he'll hate you!

01:15:12.506 --> 01:15:14.209
You'll lose him forever!

01:15:52.880 --> 01:15:54.681
I'll be back, promise.

01:16:44.064 --> 01:16:47.634
Hello! So what you
gonna call him then?

01:16:48.769 --> 01:16:51.705
Dunno,
maybe Luke Skywalker.

01:16:52.974 --> 01:16:54.308
But
the lady in the shop

01:16:54.309 --> 01:16:56.276
didn't know if it was a boy.

01:16:56.277 --> 01:16:58.879
Maybe it should
be Princess Leia.

01:16:58.880 --> 01:17:01.015
No way, I'm not having
a girl in my room.

01:17:04.318 --> 01:17:06.321
Luke Skywalker it is then.
