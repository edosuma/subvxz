00:08.360 --> 00:11.600
<i>Gardai have have put in
place a 24-hour protection post </i>

00:11.640 --> 00:14.760
<i>outside the homes of
a prominent Dublin crime family </i>

00:14.800 --> 00:18.280
<i>amidst fears of rising tension
of escalating violence </i>

00:18.320 --> 00:20.800
<i>between rival
organized-crime gangs. </i>

00:33.800 --> 00:35.960
Glen?

00:36.000 --> 00:37.280
We spotted Jamie
on Wicker.

00:37.320 --> 00:40.360
They just pulled out
of Carmel Place.

00:40.400 --> 00:42.160
I want Michael.

00:42.200 --> 00:43.680
I'll keep on him,
sir.

00:43.720 --> 00:46.160
Just make sure
you get Michael.

02:00.960 --> 02:03.480
<i>Michael, can you take
a deep breath and hold, please? </i>

02:08.760 --> 02:11.000
<i>That's great.
Thank you. </i>

02:13.080 --> 02:15.760
Can you see
what's wrong?

02:18.040 --> 02:20.360
<i>Dr. O'Malley will go through
all that with you </i>

02:20.400 --> 02:21.720
<i>when we have
your results. </i>

02:21.760 --> 02:27.080
Just the other doctor
said it could be epilepsy.

02:27.120 --> 02:29.840
<i>As I said, the doctor will
go through it with you. </i>

02:29.880 --> 02:31.720
<i>For the time being,
</i>

02:59.840 --> 03:01.920
Come on, fool,
we got to move.

03:01.960 --> 03:03.200
Keep your eyes peeled.

03:45.280 --> 03:47.200
Can I at least
use my own name?

03:49.240 --> 03:51.320
We discussed this.

03:53.760 --> 03:57.840
Look, Larkin is
my family name, so...

03:57.880 --> 04:01.040
it's kinda your name,
too.

04:01.080 --> 04:02.440
I want
to use Kinsella.

04:05.280 --> 04:07.240
Please.

04:07.280 --> 04:09.480
Don't make this
any harder.

04:11.480 --> 04:14.240
I'll come visit
every chance I get.

04:14.280 --> 04:16.960
And your dad will,
too...

04:17.000 --> 04:20.480
when it's safe
for him.

04:20.520 --> 04:22.960
I thought you said
nobody wanted to kill me.

04:23.000 --> 04:25.640
They don't.

04:25.680 --> 04:28.920
They why are you
sending me here?

04:28.960 --> 04:32.480
We're just being
extra careful...

04:32.520 --> 04:34.480
to make sure
that nothing happens to you.

04:51.720 --> 04:53.280
What's goin' on?

04:53.320 --> 04:55.400
Where'd yous two
disappear to?

04:55.440 --> 04:57.040
I had stuff to see to.

04:57.080 --> 04:59.760
More like, hey, presto,

04:59.800 --> 05:01.560
"The Magician" disappears,
yeah?

05:06.800 --> 05:08.640
Don't you ever
fuckin' call me that again.

05:10.280 --> 05:13.280
I was only messin',
bud.

05:13.320 --> 05:14.760
He didn't mean it,
Michael.

05:14.800 --> 05:16.360
Yeah.

05:16.400 --> 05:18.440
Got nothing
but total respect, man.

05:18.480 --> 05:20.960
Eric,
take Kem and Fudge inside.

05:23.280 --> 05:26.640
Go on.

05:26.680 --> 05:28.680
Go on!

05:31.760 --> 05:33.360
Yeah.

05:40.200 --> 05:41.160
Having a meeting later.

05:41.200 --> 05:43.960
A few things
we need to discuss.

05:44.000 --> 05:45.400
Think I'll give it a miss,
Frank.

05:45.440 --> 05:46.920
If you'd been this
fuckin' reticent

05:46.960 --> 05:49.920
about clipping Caolan Moore,
we wouldn't be in this shit.

05:49.960 --> 05:53.400
Is this still about you
trying to see your daughter?

05:53.440 --> 05:55.880
Because that's gone now.

05:55.920 --> 05:57.680
You think her case worker's
been talking to the cops

05:57.720 --> 05:59.480
about your part
in Moore's murder?

05:59.520 --> 06:01.480
Because the papers
as good as fuckin' named you.

06:01.520 --> 06:03.000
He wasn't charged
with anything, Frank.

06:03.040 --> 06:06.760
Doesn't matter a fuck.
They know he did it.

06:06.800 --> 06:10.240
Everyone does.

06:10.280 --> 06:13.000
No court is gonna give you
access to Anna.

06:13.040 --> 06:15.000
Not now.

06:15.040 --> 06:17.440
Not a fucking chance.

06:17.480 --> 06:18.680
You put
an end to that

06:18.720 --> 06:21.680
the moment you shot
Caolan Moore.

06:21.720 --> 06:23.760
The sooner
you accept that,

06:23.800 --> 06:25.480
the better
for all of us.

06:32.960 --> 06:35.680
Frank can't know
what's gonna happen with Anna.

06:39.280 --> 06:42.560
Michael...

07:23.760 --> 07:25.680
Oh.

07:25.720 --> 07:27.400
That's disgusting.

07:27.440 --> 07:29.040
Young woman:
It's like apple juice.

07:29.080 --> 07:30.040
Not the juice
I drink.

07:30.080 --> 07:31.280
You'll get used to it.

07:32.880 --> 07:35.000
Can you
feel anything yet?

07:35.040 --> 07:37.480
Just the gas.

07:37.520 --> 07:40.520
Remember, in case they ask,
we're 17.

07:40.560 --> 07:41.960
How old
are these lads, anyway?

07:42.000 --> 07:46.200
I don't know, 19, 20,
something like that.

07:46.240 --> 07:47.480
Isn't that
a bit creepy?

07:47.520 --> 07:51.360
Not if they think
we're 17.

07:51.400 --> 07:52.960
They're all
dying to meet you.

07:53.000 --> 07:55.320
- I doubt that.
- No?

07:55.360 --> 07:56.720
When Conor heard
you were a Kinsella,

07:56.760 --> 07:58.400
he said to make sure
I brought you.

07:58.440 --> 08:00.680
Why'd you tell him that?

08:00.720 --> 08:02.520
'Cause you are.

08:02.560 --> 08:04.680
Yeah, but that's
nobody else's business,

08:04.720 --> 08:06.200
and you shouldn't be
tellin' people that.

08:06.240 --> 08:07.880
What difference
does it make?

08:07.920 --> 08:09.920
You don't know
what it's like.

08:09.960 --> 08:12.240
If they're not tryin' to score
drugs off me, then they'll be,

08:12.280 --> 08:13.480
"Did your da
kill your mam?

08:13.520 --> 08:15.480
Did he really shoot
all those people?"

08:15.520 --> 08:16.920
No one's gonna say that.

08:16.960 --> 08:19.000
That's exactly
what Jane's brother said.

08:19.040 --> 08:21.000
- I told you this.
- No, you didn't.

08:21.040 --> 08:23.960
Now, that's a fucking lie.

08:24.000 --> 08:25.560
Why are you getting so worked up
about this?

08:25.600 --> 08:26.960
'Cause it's not your place
to be telling people

08:27.000 --> 08:28.480
who my family are.

08:28.520 --> 08:29.880
I don't know why
you're ashamed of them.

08:29.920 --> 08:31.400
I am not
ashamed of them.

08:31.440 --> 08:32.920
I'd love family
who are criminals.

08:32.960 --> 08:34.600
It'd be deadly.

08:34.640 --> 08:36.880
You can go on your own.
I'mma head home.

08:36.920 --> 08:39.200
Why are you being
such a baby?

08:39.240 --> 08:40.960
'Cause you're being
a bitch.

08:43.640 --> 08:45.520
The only reason
you're invited anywhere, Anna,

08:45.560 --> 08:47.440
is 'cause
you're a fucking Kinsella.

08:57.520 --> 09:00.040
The classrooms are all
in the Swift Building.

09:00.080 --> 09:03.280
So is the computer lab
and science rooms.

09:03.320 --> 09:05.320
You'll soon get the hang of it,
Anthony.

09:05.360 --> 09:07.280
Simon, will you show Anthony
to his dorm,

09:07.320 --> 09:09.280
help him
- get settled in?
- Yes, sir.

09:17.960 --> 09:20.440
Alright.

09:52.280 --> 09:54.000
Frank.

09:54.040 --> 09:56.480
<i>Amanda, we need you
to do something for us. </i>

10:38.520 --> 10:41.480
I have a list from Frank
of everything he needs.

10:41.520 --> 10:44.240
We can give you 400 now
and then the same again --

10:44.280 --> 10:47.120
I can't
do business with you.

10:47.160 --> 10:49.440
Pretend I'm Frank.

10:49.480 --> 10:51.200
All I'm doing is carrying out
his instructions.

10:51.240 --> 10:53.440
Not with
any of your lot.

10:53.480 --> 10:55.240
I can't sell
to yous anymore.

10:57.920 --> 11:00.200
We'll pay an extra 50
on delivery.

11:00.240 --> 11:01.680
You could
offer me double.

11:01.720 --> 11:03.640
It's not gonna make
any difference.

11:03.680 --> 11:06.240
Eamon Cunningham
has made it very clear

11:06.280 --> 11:09.080
that anybody dealing with your
family will be a target, too.

11:10.520 --> 11:14.120
I'm only here
out of respect for Frank.

11:14.160 --> 11:16.240
But your business --

11:16.280 --> 11:19.000
it's just
not worth the grief.

11:19.040 --> 11:20.680
Is there anyone else
we can go to?

11:20.720 --> 11:23.520
I doubt it,

11:23.560 --> 11:25.480
'cause nobody
is fuckin' reckless enough

11:25.520 --> 11:27.240
to get on
the wrong side of Eamon, yeah?

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
Fuck Ged Delaney.

11:42.040 --> 11:44.000
He's a little fuckin' bitch.

11:44.040 --> 11:45.720
If we've got the coin,
someone will sell to us.

11:45.760 --> 11:48.880
Like who?

11:48.920 --> 11:50.480
We don't know.

11:50.520 --> 11:51.840
What about the Devitts?

11:51.880 --> 11:53.840
Won't even
answer the phone to me.

11:53.880 --> 11:55.520
No one will.

11:55.560 --> 11:58.120
How much gear
have we got left?

11:58.160 --> 11:59.960
Fudge says
we're runnin' low on everything,

12:00.000 --> 12:01.920
especially coke
and brown.

12:01.960 --> 12:05.840
He reckons we've got about
a week, maybe 10 days, tops,

12:05.880 --> 12:07.600
before we have to start
shutting houses down.

12:28.680 --> 12:30.160
Fuck.

12:39.040 --> 12:40.920
Just delivering food.

12:40.960 --> 12:42.640
Deliver this every day.

12:42.680 --> 12:44.440
Do you have any I.D. on you
or anything like that?

12:44.480 --> 12:45.960
I don't have I.D.
on me,

12:46.000 --> 12:49.240
but, like, I mean,
just delivering food.

12:49.280 --> 12:51.240
But I can't --It's okay lads.

12:51.280 --> 12:53.240
It's for me.

13:01.840 --> 13:04.440
Cheers.

13:20.280 --> 13:22.320
I heard
you were in hospital.

13:24.400 --> 13:26.640
So,
is everything okay?

13:28.400 --> 13:31.040
Yeah,
it's nothing.

13:31.080 --> 13:32.720
Wasting your time.
He won't tell ya.

13:37.800 --> 13:39.280
How was Anthony?

13:42.720 --> 13:44.960
He was upset.

13:45.000 --> 13:47.440
And I felt like shit.

13:47.480 --> 13:50.040
Yeah, it's called
a guilty conscience.

13:53.760 --> 13:56.240
Excuse me?

13:56.280 --> 13:57.960
I said, "It's called
a guilty conscience."

13:58.000 --> 14:01.040
I don't see why we're sending
him off to that place, so...

14:02.520 --> 14:04.680
Oh, well, let me
explain to you, Jimmy,

14:04.720 --> 14:06.920
because I don't like it
any more than you.

14:06.960 --> 14:08.400
But I'd rather this

14:08.440 --> 14:10.440
than spend every moment
he's out of my sight

14:10.480 --> 14:13.440
wondering whether
he's gonna be killed or not.

14:13.480 --> 14:15.280
Is that
simple enough for you?

14:18.960 --> 14:21.000
So, this is it,
then, is it,

14:21.040 --> 14:22.920
packing our son away,
hiding out here?

14:22.960 --> 14:24.480
For what?

14:24.520 --> 14:26.680
Eamon fucking Cunningham
to take us out one by one?

14:26.720 --> 14:28.680
Hey,
I got an idea.

14:28.720 --> 14:30.040
Let's play a game.

14:30.080 --> 14:31.680
Let's play a game called
Who's Next?

14:31.720 --> 14:33.840
Now, they already got
your Noelly,

14:33.880 --> 14:36.440
uh, Frank's mate Jock,
two of the dealers.

14:36.480 --> 14:37.960
But, you see, they're all
low-hangin' fruit.

14:38.000 --> 14:40.240
Jimmy.
What --
What Eamon needs --

14:40.280 --> 14:44.040
What Eamon <i>really</i> needs
is to get one of the family.

14:45.480 --> 14:48.000
So,
who's it gonna be?

14:51.080 --> 14:53.920
You go first, Amanda.
Who the fuck do you reckon?

14:53.960 --> 14:56.920
Jesus Christ, Jimmy,
can we just have a break

14:56.960 --> 14:58.240
from all this
for one night?

14:58.280 --> 15:00.920
That's the thing.

15:00.960 --> 15:03.360
There is no fuckin' break
from this.

15:03.400 --> 15:06.120
This is it
until it's over!

15:06.160 --> 15:07.680
The cop car
parked out there

15:07.720 --> 15:09.040
isn't gonna be
protectin' us forever.

15:09.080 --> 15:10.720
When they fuck off, then what?
Then what?!

15:10.760 --> 15:13.160
Seriously, Jimmy,
give it a rest.

15:27.000 --> 15:28.960
I need a fuckin' piss.

15:44.960 --> 15:49.080
How come you don't seem bothered
by any of this?

15:49.120 --> 15:50.680
Used to
being locked up.

15:58.960 --> 16:01.160
Do you think
it was a mistake...

16:01.200 --> 16:03.440
doin' what we did?

16:03.480 --> 16:05.440
Would you rather
be sat here now,

16:05.480 --> 16:07.040
having accepted that money
from Eamon Cunningham?

16:09.320 --> 16:10.760
No.

16:10.800 --> 16:13.320
That's your answer.

16:18.240 --> 16:20.320
Jimmy's right,
though.

16:21.720 --> 16:25.880
We can't just sit here,
waiting to be killed.

16:25.920 --> 16:27.480
Then what do we do?

16:32.200 --> 16:34.160
Eamon has got
more people,

16:34.200 --> 16:36.960
more money,
more...everything than us.

16:39.440 --> 16:42.920
Then we have to be
smarter than him.

16:42.960 --> 16:46.440
Is that it?

16:46.480 --> 16:49.720
I'm serious.

16:49.760 --> 16:51.520
He's attacking
this family.

16:54.320 --> 16:55.840
So fuck him.

16:57.920 --> 16:59.920
Fuck Eamon Cunningham.

17:19.120 --> 17:21.200
Watch your back
in there, pal.

17:21.240 --> 17:22.680
Always, man.

17:30.840 --> 17:33.160
Boss,
we have him in our sight.

17:33.200 --> 17:34.560
Do you want us
to go ahead?

17:40.920 --> 17:42.440
Yeah, do him.

18:20.000 --> 18:22.240
Roddy?

18:22.280 --> 18:23.520
How are you,
Kem?

18:23.560 --> 18:24.720
Got the paper?

18:24.760 --> 18:27.880
Yeah.

18:27.920 --> 18:28.960
See you later.

18:33.200 --> 18:34.320
Alright, V?

18:34.360 --> 18:35.840
Are we
comin' over later?

18:35.880 --> 18:37.560
Of course,
yeah.

18:37.600 --> 18:39.400
Will you pick us up
a bottle of CM and some blow?

18:39.440 --> 18:41.200
I'm going up the fuckin' walls
over here.

18:41.240 --> 18:42.640
No bother,
yeah?

18:44.200 --> 18:45.840
Give us a wrap
and two zimmers.

18:45.880 --> 18:47.200
I'm not
fuckin' sellin'.

18:47.240 --> 18:48.200
Why don't you just
sgive us a wrap, then?

18:48.240 --> 18:49.440
Come on, man.

18:49.480 --> 18:51.200
I told ya,
I'm not fuckin' sellin'.

18:51.240 --> 18:52.480
Come on,
just give us it.

18:52.520 --> 18:54.440
Look, V,
I have to go.

18:54.480 --> 18:56.440
There's some junkie here
annoying the arse off of me.

18:56.480 --> 18:57.680
Go on.
Catch ya later.

18:57.720 --> 18:58.720
Yes, yeah.

19:00.520 --> 19:02.720
Is there something
fuckin' wrong with you?

19:02.760 --> 19:05.680
Is there?
I told ya, I'm not sellin'.

19:05.720 --> 19:07.680
Do you have any spare change,
then, for a wrap?

19:09.680 --> 19:12.160
Go on,
take that and fuck off.

19:26.560 --> 19:28.920
Are you fuckin' me?!

19:46.920 --> 19:50.360
Frank should be talkin'
to you about things, not Dotser.

19:50.400 --> 19:52.160
You're the one
that he should be trustin' most.

19:52.200 --> 19:54.160
Yeah,
I fuckin' know that.

19:54.200 --> 19:57.640
But he's Frank.
What can we do?

19:57.680 --> 20:00.040
You're not
just gonna sit back

20:00.080 --> 20:02.640
and let Dotser
take what should be yours.

20:02.680 --> 20:04.880
No.

20:13.920 --> 20:15.800
Just give me a fuckin' blowy,
will ya?

20:19.440 --> 20:20.480
Hmm?

20:33.200 --> 20:34.920
Oh, shit.

20:39.480 --> 20:41.680
Hey, Da.

20:41.720 --> 20:43.520
Hey, come inside a second,
yeah?

20:51.920 --> 20:54.160
What?

20:59.760 --> 21:01.720
Who'd they get?

21:01.760 --> 21:03.000
Fudge.

21:08.520 --> 21:10.880
Whoever did this is dead.

21:12.480 --> 21:14.200
Ya hear me?

21:14.240 --> 21:15.920
They're fuckin' dead!

21:17.720 --> 21:20.880
And I don't wanna hear no
bullshit about not hitting back!

21:26.400 --> 21:28.640
Where the fuck were you
when it happened?!

21:28.680 --> 21:32.400
I was up with Roddy,
collectin', yeah?

21:32.440 --> 21:34.080
Fudge was out waitin'
in the car.

21:34.120 --> 21:35.640
Fudge does
the collections.

21:35.680 --> 21:37.920
You drive.
Why was he in the car?

21:39.720 --> 21:42.200
Fudge felt safer
in the car,

21:42.240 --> 21:44.160
so he had me
doing them instead.

21:49.640 --> 21:52.120
What?
Ask anyone, Frank.

21:52.160 --> 21:54.600
I've dealing with
the collections for weeks now.

21:54.640 --> 21:56.640
Wasn't just tonight.

21:56.680 --> 21:58.880
It's what Fudge wanted.

21:58.920 --> 22:01.640
I was only doing
what he asked me.

22:03.440 --> 22:06.640
And we changed our routes
every day like you said.

22:06.680 --> 22:07.880
Always going
at different times.

22:07.920 --> 22:09.480
Give me your phone.

22:19.720 --> 22:21.920
Is that
the only one you have?

22:21.960 --> 22:23.680
Yeah.

22:23.720 --> 22:25.640
Unlock it.

22:36.920 --> 22:39.400
Who's that number?

22:39.440 --> 22:42.320
That one there, that you called
just before you called me?

22:42.360 --> 22:43.680
That's Roddy's burner.

22:43.720 --> 22:45.160
I was warning him
to clear out the flat,

22:45.200 --> 22:46.920
'cause the cops
would be coming.

22:46.960 --> 22:48.720
Then, I rang you.

22:57.240 --> 22:59.480
Yeah, Roddy?

22:59.520 --> 23:00.880
Kem?

23:00.920 --> 23:02.880
No, no, it's Frank.

23:02.920 --> 23:04.960
Frank, yeah.
Yeah.

23:10.400 --> 23:12.040
Tryin' to find out
what happened tonight.

23:12.080 --> 23:14.920
Yeah?

23:17.480 --> 23:19.200
And where was Kem
when that happened?

23:19.240 --> 23:21.160
Yeah.

23:28.360 --> 23:30.080
Okay, cheers, Roddy.

23:36.200 --> 23:37.640
Here.

23:37.680 --> 23:38.880
Take it.

23:42.240 --> 23:44.440
Go.

23:44.480 --> 23:47.600
V, man.
V.

24:15.200 --> 24:17.640
Hello?

24:17.680 --> 24:20.920
Hello?

24:26.240 --> 24:28.920
Who is this?

24:30.920 --> 24:32.720
Why'd you kill her?

24:42.360 --> 24:43.800
Answer me, Michael.

24:46.640 --> 24:48.360
It was --

24:48.400 --> 24:50.600
It was an accident,
Anna.

24:52.440 --> 24:54.640
How do you accidentally
shoot someone?

24:57.240 --> 25:00.200
I was off me head
on gear.

25:00.240 --> 25:02.440
I-I didn't know
what I was doin'.

25:06.560 --> 25:08.440
If you were
off your head,

25:08.480 --> 25:11.320
how do you know
it was an accident?

25:11.360 --> 25:13.120
Maybe that's what
you really wanted to do,

25:13.160 --> 25:14.480
and you just
can't remember.

25:14.520 --> 25:16.000
No.

25:16.040 --> 25:17.960
How do you know?

25:18.000 --> 25:21.560
You know I'd never do anything
to hurt your mother.

25:21.600 --> 25:23.840
But you <i>did</i> hurt her.

25:23.880 --> 25:25.840
You killed her.

25:28.080 --> 25:29.680
Not on purpose.

25:31.720 --> 25:34.160
You can't
be certain of that --

25:34.200 --> 25:36.440
not if
you were off your head.

25:37.960 --> 25:39.920
I <i>am</i> certain.

25:39.960 --> 25:43.240
- Anna, I'm certain.
- So...

25:43.280 --> 25:47.160
how are you certain,
Michael?

25:51.640 --> 25:54.360
Do you remember
when you were little,

25:54.400 --> 25:56.840
and I'd take you
to the pool

25:56.880 --> 25:58.600
and the only way
we could get you to jump in

25:58.640 --> 26:01.600
was if
I promised to catch you?

26:01.640 --> 26:04.640
I always did.
You'd jump, I'd catch you.

26:04.680 --> 26:05.880
And --

26:05.920 --> 26:09.640
And then we'd laugh together
so much.

26:09.680 --> 26:13.760
Every single time.
D-Do you remember that?

26:17.720 --> 26:20.400
Do you really think
that I'd ever

26:20.440 --> 26:22.640
deliberately do anything
that would hurt you?

26:25.680 --> 26:27.920
Anna?

26:27.960 --> 26:29.600
I love ya.

26:31.320 --> 26:32.440
Huh?

27:35.520 --> 27:38.280
Birdy just called.

27:38.320 --> 27:41.360
Fudge was shot.

27:41.400 --> 27:42.920
Is he dead?

27:47.520 --> 27:50.200
This is why I don't want Anthony
being anywhere here.

27:50.240 --> 27:51.640
Yeah.

27:51.680 --> 27:54.640
You can't go
to the funeral.

27:54.680 --> 27:56.440
I have to.

27:56.480 --> 27:59.120
No, they'll be countin'
on you or Frank

27:59.160 --> 28:00.600
or one of the family
turnin' up.

28:00.640 --> 28:02.840
They'll be waitin'.

28:02.880 --> 28:05.040
You just can't go.

28:12.040 --> 28:14.200
Don't leave the house
without wearing your vest.

28:30.880 --> 28:32.680
Mikey?

28:37.400 --> 28:39.040
Yeah?

28:39.080 --> 28:41.200
I'm going to supermarket.
Do you need anything?

28:44.160 --> 28:46.200
No,
I'm grand for now.

28:51.920 --> 28:54.200
You heard about Fudge?

28:54.240 --> 28:55.760
Yeah.

29:01.200 --> 29:04.160
Look, I know Frank was angry
about Caolan Moore,

29:04.200 --> 29:06.840
but I understand
why you did it.

29:09.160 --> 29:11.240
How could you refuse Jimmy
when he asked you for help?

29:11.280 --> 29:12.600
You couldn't.

29:12.640 --> 29:14.040
He's your brother.

29:14.080 --> 29:15.640
You did
what was right.

29:19.880 --> 29:21.720
But we need you now,
too.

29:24.920 --> 29:26.960
We need you,
Mikey.

29:28.960 --> 29:30.280
This family needs you.

29:37.080 --> 29:39.000
Okay.

29:39.880 --> 29:42.240
Okay.

30:33.440 --> 30:35.600
Here comes Beady.

30:57.680 --> 30:59.440
Jesus.

30:59.480 --> 31:01.120
Yeah,
safest place in Dublin

31:01.160 --> 31:03.200
for us at the moment,
Beady.

31:03.240 --> 31:04.880
I cannot stay long,
Frank.

31:04.920 --> 31:06.200
Yeah, yeah, I know.

31:06.240 --> 31:08.400
Appreciate you comin'.

31:10.440 --> 31:12.560
Need to
ask you a favor.

31:12.600 --> 31:15.120
Hope that's a joke.

31:15.160 --> 31:16.600
I want you to set up
a meeting for me

31:16.640 --> 31:19.200
with that Tunisian lad
in Antwerp you used to buy from.

31:19.240 --> 31:21.120
You want to get me plugged,
Frank?

31:21.160 --> 31:24.440
You owe me, and a lot more
than a fuckin' introduction.

31:26.640 --> 31:30.600
If I set this up for you,
then that's it, Frank.

31:30.640 --> 31:31.760
Don't call me again.

31:33.720 --> 31:35.120
Okay.

32:07.160 --> 32:09.880
What you want?

32:09.920 --> 32:11.400
Can we talk inside?

32:11.440 --> 32:13.240
No.

32:15.440 --> 32:17.600
I was going through
the accounts,

32:17.640 --> 32:19.640
and I noticed I still owed Noel
for work he'd done.

32:22.680 --> 32:25.560
Wanted to make sure
you got it.

32:25.600 --> 32:27.800
No,
you didn't.

32:27.840 --> 32:29.840
I know exactly how much
Noel was due,

32:29.880 --> 32:31.120
and if you'd have
owed him a penny,

32:31.160 --> 32:33.280
I'd have come
lookin' for it.

32:33.320 --> 32:35.680
It's a bonus.

32:35.720 --> 32:36.880
Take it.

32:45.840 --> 32:48.680
How much is in here?

32:48.720 --> 32:50.280
30,000.

32:53.200 --> 32:55.320
You know, I didn't want Noel
to help you.

32:55.360 --> 32:56.880
I warned him
against it.

32:56.920 --> 32:59.000
He liked you.

32:59.040 --> 33:01.120
He said
after your son was killed,

33:01.160 --> 33:03.360
they offered you 150 grand
to make good,

33:03.400 --> 33:05.760
and you
turned it down.

33:05.800 --> 33:07.160
He was impressed
by that.

33:09.400 --> 33:12.840
And now here you are,
doing the very same thing.

33:12.880 --> 33:15.840
Except it's only 30 grand
for my husband.

33:15.880 --> 33:17.280
That's not
what this is.

33:17.320 --> 33:20.120
That's exactly
what this is.

33:20.160 --> 33:22.240
Except I don't have the luxury
of turnin' it down,

33:22.280 --> 33:23.600
not like you do.

33:27.440 --> 33:30.000
What was so special
about your son, anyway?

33:31.920 --> 33:34.360
What do you mean?

33:34.400 --> 33:37.600
I mean, he must have been
really fuckin' special,

33:37.640 --> 33:39.120
'cause look at all the people
who have had to die

33:39.160 --> 33:40.600
'cause of what happened
to him.

33:46.960 --> 33:48.400
Before he was killed,

33:48.440 --> 33:50.640
Noel took home the VRT
and reg books for a car

33:50.680 --> 33:53.200
he was
changing ownership on.

33:53.240 --> 33:54.920
I need them back.

33:54.960 --> 33:57.080
Of course you do.

33:57.120 --> 33:59.120
Evidence of fraud
and money laundering.

34:19.880 --> 34:21.880
If you ever
come back here again,

34:21.920 --> 34:23.360
I'll put you
on your fuckin' arse!

34:23.400 --> 34:25.640
Now go fuck yourself!

34:33.200 --> 34:36.360
Clayton <i>Yeah, two in
the head, and now he's dead. </i>

34:36.400 --> 34:40.000
<i>All is well,
Fudge rots in hell. </i>

34:40.040 --> 34:42.320
<i>Yeah! </i>

34:43.800 --> 34:46.760
<i>Two in the head,
and now he's dead. </i>

34:46.800 --> 34:50.120
<i>All is well,
Fudge rots in hell. </i>

34:50.160 --> 34:52.360
<i>
And you're next, Eric -- </i>

34:52.400 --> 34:56.160
<i>you and Faggot Frank --
benders, the pair of yous. </i>

34:56.200 --> 34:58.120
<i>A family of fuckin' queers.</i>

34:58.160 --> 34:59.640
<i>Fuckin', you're all
gonna fuckin' die. </i>

34:59.680 --> 35:01.920
<i>All is well,
Fudge rots in hell. </i>

35:01.960 --> 35:04.360
<i>Two in the head,
and now he's dead. </i>

35:04.400 --> 35:07.280
<i>All is well,
Fudge rots in hell. </i>

35:32.880 --> 35:34.360
Hi.

35:34.400 --> 35:35.600
Alright?

35:35.640 --> 35:37.360
Yeah.

35:37.400 --> 35:39.520
I was lookin'
for Jimmy.

35:39.560 --> 35:42.200
He was gone when I got home,
and his phone's turned off.

35:44.600 --> 35:46.360
I checked Twitter.

35:46.400 --> 35:48.840
No one's been shot.

35:48.880 --> 35:50.240
Come in.

36:02.720 --> 36:05.840
I've had a shit day,
so startin' early.

36:07.720 --> 36:09.480
Do you want one?

36:09.520 --> 36:11.400
No.

36:11.440 --> 36:14.480
Aye, that's right,
you don't drink anymore.

36:17.640 --> 36:19.800
Why is that?

36:19.840 --> 36:21.840
Feel better without it.

36:29.080 --> 36:30.560
Maybe I should go.

36:30.600 --> 36:32.160
Oh, no, stay.

36:34.880 --> 36:38.320
It's boring,
drinking on your own.

36:38.360 --> 36:40.440
Amanda,
is something wrong?

36:40.480 --> 36:42.360
You alright?

36:42.400 --> 36:45.360
I told you.

36:45.400 --> 36:47.360
I've had
a shitty day.

36:47.400 --> 36:49.360
And I'm gonna
have a drink.

36:49.400 --> 36:51.920
And make somebody pay.

37:00.560 --> 37:03.160
Sit.

37:36.400 --> 37:38.880
You know
what's fuckin' weird?

37:40.880 --> 37:43.200
You haven't said a word
about Jamie.

37:47.160 --> 37:49.320
Nothin'.

37:49.360 --> 37:51.720
Not even
when we were buryin' him.

37:58.440 --> 38:00.080
What was I
supposed to say?

38:00.120 --> 38:04.800
Anything --
Anything at all.

38:04.840 --> 38:07.200
You could have asked to say
a Prayer of the Faithful.

38:07.240 --> 38:08.960
It wouldn't have been fair
on Jimmy.

38:13.880 --> 38:15.600
What did you think

38:15.640 --> 38:19.080
when you heard
I was pregnant with him?

38:19.120 --> 38:21.360
I mean,
you'd been fuckin' me,

38:21.400 --> 38:24.160
so you must've known
he could've been yours.

38:27.040 --> 38:30.600
Didn't you ever wonder
when you see Jamie,

38:30.640 --> 38:32.560
"Is he mine?

38:32.600 --> 38:35.440
Is that my son?"

38:35.480 --> 38:39.000
Or was it just like,
"Not my fuckin' problem."

38:41.280 --> 38:43.400
Answer me.

38:46.160 --> 38:50.120
You saw him all the time
before you went to jail.

38:50.160 --> 38:51.840
He was growing up
in front of you.

38:51.880 --> 38:55.240
- What did you think?
- I thought
he was Jimmy's boy.

38:55.280 --> 38:56.880
No, you didn't.

38:59.880 --> 39:03.520
I don't believe you.

39:03.560 --> 39:06.440
You knew.

39:06.480 --> 39:10.200
Jimmy raised him,
but Jamie was yours.

39:11.560 --> 39:14.160
And deep down,
you knew.

39:16.320 --> 39:19.840
He was just as much yours
as Anna is.

39:28.360 --> 39:30.400
What the fuck is this?

39:30.440 --> 39:31.640
A party?

39:33.440 --> 39:36.840
Yeah, might be, if only
we could get your brother

39:36.880 --> 39:38.760
to have a drink.

39:38.800 --> 39:40.760
Where were you?

39:40.800 --> 39:43.000
Out with Frank.

39:43.040 --> 39:46.760
He set us up
with a new supplier.

39:46.800 --> 39:49.640
At last,
something to celebrate.

39:55.440 --> 39:58.280
Who is the supplier?

39:58.320 --> 40:02.320
Some Tunisian that
Beady Donovan knows.

40:02.360 --> 40:05.800
Frank's going to have to
fly to Belgium to meet him.

40:11.680 --> 40:13.080
If I was
Eamon Cunningham,

40:13.120 --> 40:14.720
I'd be doing
everything I could

40:14.760 --> 40:17.000
to get you lot away from here,
where you're safe.

40:17.040 --> 40:19.320
And that's
what he's done.

40:21.840 --> 40:23.560
He stopped everyone
selling to us,

40:23.600 --> 40:25.560
so now Frank
has to go to Belgium,

40:25.600 --> 40:27.840
where he won't
have a vest,

40:27.880 --> 40:29.160
and he'll be
putting his trust

40:29.200 --> 40:32.800
in someone
he's never even met.

40:32.840 --> 40:36.080
That's bollocks.

40:36.120 --> 40:37.800
Okay.

40:41.840 --> 40:44.960
Michael, tell her.

40:47.560 --> 40:50.080
If I was Frank,
I wouldn't go.

41:00.880 --> 41:03.120
You'll be in Belgium,
Frank,

41:03.160 --> 41:05.160
on your own with some lad
we don't even know.

41:05.200 --> 41:07.360
If Eamon's gonna get you,
that's where it'll be.

41:07.400 --> 41:09.840
You think I haven't
thought about that already?

41:09.880 --> 41:12.360
Do you trust Beady?

41:12.400 --> 41:14.120
No...

41:14.160 --> 41:16.280
not now.

41:16.320 --> 41:18.120
Not with all that shit
with Eamon.

41:18.160 --> 41:20.160
Don't trust anyone
outside this room.

41:22.160 --> 41:24.400
What's going on?

41:24.440 --> 41:27.240
Amanda thinks the meeting
in Antwerp could be a setup.

41:27.280 --> 41:31.120
So, what choice do we have?

41:31.160 --> 41:36.200
If we don't find a new supplier,
we're finished.

41:36.240 --> 41:39.560
No business, no money comin' in,
can't hire anyone.

41:39.600 --> 41:42.200
What does that
future look like for us?

41:45.160 --> 41:47.280
I know it's a risk
going over there,

41:47.320 --> 41:48.480
but I have to take it.

41:56.120 --> 41:58.600
Can I ask something?

41:58.640 --> 42:00.160
Yeah.

42:00.200 --> 42:02.520
When you bought from
Eamon Cunningham,

42:02.560 --> 42:05.760
was it him you dealt with
directly or was it someone else?

42:05.800 --> 42:07.400
Con Doyle.

42:07.440 --> 42:09.840
He wholesales
for Eamon here.

42:09.880 --> 42:11.400
Con Doyle looks after

42:11.440 --> 42:13.480
all of Eamon Cunningham's drugs
in Dublin?

42:13.520 --> 42:15.280
Not just for Dublin,
the whole country.

42:18.200 --> 42:21.280
So, we find out where he stores
Eamon's gear and rob them.

42:23.240 --> 42:25.840
Yeah.

42:25.880 --> 42:28.440
Fuck, yeah!

42:33.880 --> 42:37.840
Now,
if we did that,

42:37.880 --> 42:42.600
there's no way back,
ever.

42:42.640 --> 42:45.120
He's trying to wipe us
fuckin' out.

42:45.160 --> 42:46.840
What are we
supposed to do,

42:46.880 --> 42:49.680
wait here and hope
he changes his mind?

42:49.720 --> 42:52.400
I'm sick
of everyone calling us bitches

42:52.440 --> 42:53.840
for hidin' away here.

42:53.880 --> 42:55.120
Let's show them.

42:59.200 --> 43:02.320
I mean, you'd probably
be safer robbin' Eamon here

43:02.360 --> 43:04.960
than headin' off
on your own to Antwerp,

43:05.000 --> 43:07.560
where you'll be exposed
and vulnerable.

43:12.640 --> 43:15.360
Are you
part of this now?

43:15.400 --> 43:17.600
Yeah.
So,
what do you think?

43:21.360 --> 43:23.800
I think
Amanda's right.

43:23.840 --> 43:25.760
It's the smart thing.

43:25.800 --> 43:27.560
And they
won't be expectin' it.

43:47.720 --> 43:51.600
So, Eric,
you go with Jimmy.

43:51.640 --> 43:53.560
I'll have Dotser
drive Michael.

43:53.600 --> 43:56.120
Mm.

43:56.160 --> 43:58.680
No, I don't think we should
have Dotser on this.

44:00.200 --> 44:02.800
What the fuck
is that supposed to mean?

44:02.840 --> 44:04.560
Just sayin'.

44:04.600 --> 44:06.360
He's not family.

44:06.400 --> 44:08.520
Things are different now.

44:08.560 --> 44:11.040
So, you're sayin'
we can't count on Dotser,

44:11.080 --> 44:12.280
like he's a rat
or something?

44:12.320 --> 44:14.200
No.
No,
because he's not.

44:14.240 --> 44:15.640
And I'll tell you
what else he's not.

44:15.680 --> 44:19.800
He's not a fuckup
and he's not a liability.

44:19.840 --> 44:23.120
Okay?
I would trust him with my life.

44:23.160 --> 44:24.840
Hmm.

44:24.880 --> 44:28.560
Well, maybe that's the problem,
Frank.

44:28.600 --> 44:31.600
Everyone knows
how much you trust him.

44:31.640 --> 44:33.600
And the way to get to you
would be through Dotser.

44:33.640 --> 44:36.600
That's all I was sayin'.

44:41.320 --> 44:43.760
And Eric's right.

44:43.800 --> 44:45.280
Everything's different now.

45:01.600 --> 45:03.880
Thanks for
gettin' these.

45:03.920 --> 45:05.840
No problem.
You okay?

45:05.880 --> 45:08.360
Yeah.
Don't look so worried.

45:08.400 --> 45:10.440
Frank's got everything
worked out for us.

45:30.600 --> 45:32.320
You're not
wearing a vest?

45:32.360 --> 45:35.560
- Nah.
- You think
that's wise?

45:35.600 --> 45:38.120
I don't want them to think
I care enough to wear one.

45:38.160 --> 45:40.720
Good to have you back,
Michael.

45:40.760 --> 45:42.120
Where's Dotser?

45:42.160 --> 45:44.080
This is just us.

45:44.120 --> 45:45.320
Just family.

45:58.920 --> 46:00.560
- See ya later.
- Uh-huh.

46:43.120 --> 46:44.880
Is this about
Jamie's killing?

46:44.920 --> 46:46.880
Indirectly, yes.

46:46.920 --> 46:49.800
We believe Jamie's killing was
in retaliation for a shooting

46:49.840 --> 46:53.280
that happened
a couple of nights earlier.

46:53.320 --> 46:55.760
What has that got to do
with Jamie?

46:55.800 --> 46:58.760
We believe one of your cars here
was used in that first shooting.

47:01.760 --> 47:03.320
Which car?

47:05.560 --> 47:07.800
Black BMW.

47:07.840 --> 47:13.120
- The reg is 191
- D11570.

47:25.600 --> 47:27.760
It says here it's out on
a "sale or return" test drive.

47:27.800 --> 47:28.840
To who?

47:32.760 --> 47:35.080
Hmm.

47:35.120 --> 47:36.520
There's no name there,

47:36.560 --> 47:40.080
so it was probably
a walk-in.

47:40.120 --> 47:43.040
There's probably
some paper record somewhere.

47:43.080 --> 47:45.560
I'll have to
chase that up for you.

47:45.600 --> 47:47.600
You do that,
and we'll be back.

47:47.640 --> 47:49.560
Okay.

47:49.600 --> 47:53.080
Just to warn you, we do get
a lot of people in here

47:53.120 --> 47:54.720
givin' fake names
and addresses.

47:54.760 --> 47:56.920
Well, let's hope
that's not the case.

47:56.960 --> 47:58.840
It'll save us from getting
a court order

47:58.880 --> 48:01.840
to seize
all your computers and records.

48:01.880 --> 48:04.240
I do hope you
find something.

48:04.280 --> 48:06.040
We really do want
to get to the bottom

48:06.080 --> 48:07.960
of why
your son was killed.
