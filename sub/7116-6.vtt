Wow, this is a really cool place.

04:50.330 --> 04:52.640

And they have awesome Sushi.

04:52.670 --> 04:55.810
Ooh, I bet they have Miso soup.
I love Miso soup.

04:55.840 --> 04:58.940

04:58.980 --> 05:01.340
Yeah.
I used to like Miso soup.

05:01.380 --> 05:03.980
Then I realized it was gross.

05:05.820 --> 05:08.950
Hellooooo Hope.
Welcome back to Nozu.

05:08.990 --> 05:10.650
Hi Mrs. Lee.

05:10.690 --> 05:14.130

05:15.010 --> 05:18.960
No, no. I'm Tori.
Remember me?

05:19.000 --> 05:21.030
You produced my friend's play.

05:21.070 --> 05:22.770
Oh yeeeaaahhh.

05:22.800 --> 05:26.470
You people left my daughter
dangling from the ceiling.

05:27.730 --> 05:30.140
Did we?

05:30.170 --> 05:32.240
Wait... what happened to
your other restaurant?

05:32.280 --> 05:33.040
Wok Star.

05:33.080 --> 05:36.480
Ohhhh. It burned down
in a mysterious fire.

05:36.510 --> 05:38.180
So sad.

05:38.220 --> 05:42.250
But then I collected the insurance
money and opened this place.

05:43.320 --> 05:46.620
But Wok Star was a chinese restaurant.

05:46.660 --> 05:48.590
Yeah so?

05:48.630 --> 05:51.730
This is a Sushi place...
Which is Japanese.

05:51.760 --> 05:55.200

05:55.230 --> 05:56.800

06:05.210 --> 06:08.810

06:24.360 --> 06:27.360

06:29.530 --> 06:31.400

06:31.440 --> 06:33.740
That is so cool, how did you...

06:33.770 --> 06:36.110

06:42.480 --> 06:47.880

- I'm serious!

07:05.400 --> 07:07.170
Please don't put any crab in her salad.

07:07.210 --> 07:10.080

07:38.940 --> 07:43.610
He is. He owns a really fancy
car and part of Texas.

07:43.640 --> 07:47.750

- Yeah, but just like the top part.

07:49.750 --> 07:52.110

Y'know this guitar
is a '62 strattenbocker...

07:57.090 --> 08:00.390

08:00.800 --> 08:04.660

08:43.330 --> 08:45.570

08:45.600 --> 08:48.000

08:48.040 --> 08:51.540
And I don't know what to do!!!

08:51.580 --> 08:54.440
You want some mashed potatoes?

08:54.480 --> 08:56.780
No, I don't want any...

08:56.810 --> 08:59.820
Gimme the bowl.

08:59.850 --> 09:03.550
Okay... why are you dating this
girl if you don't like her?

09:03.590 --> 09:06.360

09:06.390 --> 09:09.730

09:09.760 --> 09:13.160

09:13.200 --> 09:15.230
I know that, you think I don't know that?!

09:15.270 --> 09:17.930
If that man likes my music
he could make me a superstar!

09:17.970 --> 09:22.400
Why else do you think I'm datin' his
grumped-up crazy-face daughter?!

09:22.440 --> 09:26.640

09:28.200 --> 09:31.120
'Cuz I know what I'm doin' is wrong!

09:31.620 --> 09:34.180
Are these potatoes hand mashed?

09:34.510 --> 09:37.580
- Yeah, why?
- They're lumpy.

09:38.320 --> 09:41.900
If you're gonna hand mash 'em, you gotta
get up in there, get out those lumps.

09:45.900 --> 09:50.400
Okay, did you know your mom's boss has
an antique human skull in his room?

09:50.430 --> 09:51.730
Please, put that back.

09:51.770 --> 09:53.940
I'm not supposed to touch anything here.

09:53.970 --> 09:57.940
Touching things is a part of life.

09:57.980 --> 09:59.840
But I'm pretty sure
we're not supposed to...

09:59.880 --> 10:03.350
Look...

10:03.380 --> 10:06.620

That guitar was not properly hung.

12:24.360 --> 12:26.590
Oh, just be quiet!

12:26.630 --> 12:29.790
All right. Uh... sooo...
Your party seems to be kinda...

12:29.830 --> 12:33.200
No! I said spicy tuna!

12:33.230 --> 12:37.130
That's regular tuna, and I wanted spicy!

12:37.170 --> 12:42.210
Awwwww. She's sooooo sweet.

12:42.240 --> 12:44.610

12:44.640 --> 12:46.540
Hope's dad.

12:47.950 --> 12:50.310
Shawn Quincy.

12:50.350 --> 12:52.650
One of the most powerful guys
in the music business.

12:52.690 --> 12:56.050
- Look who he's with.
- Oh my God, that's Trey Dirty!

12:56.090 --> 12:57.420
Uh huh.

12:57.460 --> 13:00.690
So I'm thinkin' we drop the album

13:00.730 --> 13:02.790
So that way we can make sure that the...

13:02.830 --> 13:06.260

13:09.840 --> 13:12.970
- Aw, no.

13:13.010 --> 13:15.910

13:15.940 --> 13:17.880

14:39.060 --> 14:40.860
Yeah, you did the right thing.

14:40.890 --> 14:46.430
And she still wants me

14:46.470 --> 14:50.800
Oh! Wait, wait! Tori!
Tori, tell this man you know me!

14:50.840 --> 14:55.740

15:15.890 --> 15:19.930
- Cat... hey Cat?
- We're in here!

15:19.970 --> 15:21.370
You called Robbie?

15:21.400 --> 15:24.230
Yes, so he could help us put up
the guitar and fix the window.

15:24.270 --> 15:28.070
Robbie can barely work
the zipper on his own pants.

15:28.110 --> 15:29.840
Heh.

15:29.880 --> 15:34.180
- Whassup lil' pigeons?
- Hii.

15:34.210 --> 15:35.680
Why did you invite Beck?

15:35.710 --> 15:37.310
You didn't tell me Jade was gonna be here.

15:37.350 --> 15:39.080
I didn't know.

15:39.120 --> 15:40.850
I thought you had a date tonight.

15:40.890 --> 15:42.020
Why did you think that?

15:42.050 --> 15:45.060
- It said so on your slap page.
- Why are you stalking my slap page?

15:45.090 --> 15:50.530
- Why do you care?
- Why is Robbie's zipper down?

15:50.560 --> 15:53.960
Look, let's just get this stupid
guitar fixed and hung back up there.

15:54.000 --> 15:55.930
Before Cat's mom's boss gets back.

15:55.970 --> 15:57.530
We have to fix the window, too.

15:57.570 --> 16:02.150
Ooo, I'll find a window repair company
using the new feature on my pear phone.

16:04.450 --> 16:09.040
I need a window repair company
in Beverly hills.

16:09.250 --> 16:12.350
Checking...
For adult diapers.

16:13.520 --> 16:17.220

That was my last search!

16:19.790 --> 16:22.190

16:22.230 --> 16:25.360
Okay, uh...This is a song

16:29.400 --> 16:34.170
Um, I'll be singin' it with my

your lack of hair.

19:16.070 --> 19:18.400

- Robbie, stop.

19:30.650 --> 19:36.220
Do not touch mine.
Fine!!!

19:44.950 --> 19:47.360
- Don't cry.
- But...

19:48.670 --> 19:51.050
- I heard a buzz.
- Zip up your pants.

19:56.810 --> 20:00.480
- Hello?
- Cat, it's Carl Gibbons.

20:00.510 --> 20:02.910
I forgot my key, would you buzz me in?

20:02.950 --> 20:05.780
It's my mom's boss!

20:05.820 --> 20:09.290
- Could you buzz me in?
- Uhhh...

20:09.320 --> 20:11.960
Sure, I could...

20:11.990 --> 20:14.790
Or maybe you could go to Europe
for two weeks.

20:17.060 --> 20:19.220
Cat, buzz me in.

20:21.000 --> 20:22.330
- Kay-kay.

20:29.110 --> 20:31.880
- Cat...
- It'll be okay...

20:31.910 --> 20:36.480
When he gets up here,
we'll just explain that...

20:36.520 --> 20:38.880
- What's happening?
- Earthquake!

20:38.920 --> 20:43.080
- Earthquake!
- Okay everybody down, cover your heads!

20:53.770 --> 20:58.150
Everybody get down!
I don't have insurance!

Cat!

21:27.530 --> 21:29.570
Hi mister Gibbons.

21:29.600 --> 21:34.240
- Some stuff broke.
- I know, I...

21:34.270 --> 21:36.370
I felt the earthquake
when I was comin' up the stairs!

21:36.410 --> 21:38.040
- You kids okay?!
- Yes, sir.

21:38.080 --> 21:40.480
- We're fine.
- I'm Robbie.

21:40.510 --> 21:42.950
I'm so sorry about your guitar...

21:42.980 --> 21:45.520
And your lamp...And your table.

21:45.550 --> 21:48.620
That's all right, it's not your fault.

21:48.650 --> 21:50.420
- But...
- Cat.

21:50.460 --> 21:52.260
Mister Gibbons isn't mad at us.

21:52.290 --> 21:56.230
Because he knows the earthquake
caused all this damage.

21:56.260 --> 22:00.430
Yeah, we can only blame the earth.

22:00.470 --> 22:03.030
And its quaking.

22:03.070 --> 22:03.970
Of course.

22:04.000 --> 22:08.670
I'm just relieved that Coober
and you kids are okay.

22:08.710 --> 22:10.280
Son, your zipper.

22:11.210 --> 22:14.080
Jeeminee!

22:16.420 --> 22:21.650
- Daddy, my head hurts.
- Yes baby, whatever.

22:21.690 --> 22:23.720
- Feel better, Hope.
- Happy Birthday.

22:23.760 --> 22:26.790
Shut up!

22:26.830 --> 22:29.590
She'll be okay, but she does
have a mild concussion.

22:29.630 --> 22:31.460
I assume you'll want
to meet her at the hospital?
