00:04.376 --> 00:07.209
These omens are prelude to what?
- The four horsemen.

00:07.379 --> 00:09.643
And which one rides the red horse?
War.

00:09.848 --> 00:11.839
- You can't kill War, kiddos.
Oh, we know.

00:12.484 --> 00:13.883
The ring.
The ring!

00:16.288 --> 00:17.812
You can't stop thinking about it.

00:17.990 --> 00:20.288
Ever since you saw it dripping
off the blade of that knife.

00:20.459 --> 00:22.654
Blood. Blood.

00:22.861 --> 00:24.089
Blood.

00:24.262 --> 00:25.889
I'm not some junkie.
Really?

00:26.131 --> 00:28.725
I think that the Dean and Sam story
sucks.

00:28.900 --> 00:31.391
It is not fun. It's not entertaining.

00:31.570 --> 00:35.973
It is a river of crap that would send
most people howling to the nuthouse.

00:36.875 --> 00:38.740
How many you have to save?
- AII.

00:38.910 --> 00:41.401
- How do you get up in the morning?
- Good question.

00:41.580 --> 00:44.071
I'm just tired, man. I'm done.

00:45.517 --> 00:47.007
I am just done.

01:04.936 --> 01:05.994
First date.

01:07.773 --> 01:09.900
I had a really good time tonight,
Russell.

01:13.678 --> 01:15.475
Alice.

01:16.982 --> 01:18.176
Can I see you again?

01:18.350 --> 01:20.341
Sunday maybe?

01:21.353 --> 01:26.290
I just don't wanna be alone
on Valentine's Day again.

01:27.793 --> 01:28.851
I know what you mean.

01:47.212 --> 01:51.205
I'm sorry. I just... I don't want you to think
I'm the type of person who just...

01:51.383 --> 01:53.214
No, I should apologize. It's...

02:07.032 --> 02:08.761
Oh, God.

02:09.167 --> 02:11.897
- I respect the crap out of you right now.
- Shut up.

02:21.079 --> 02:22.205
Your neck.

02:22.380 --> 02:23.540
I think I bit you.

02:25.050 --> 02:27.041
It's okay. It's good.

02:35.093 --> 02:36.424
I've been so alone.

02:36.895 --> 02:38.055
So empty.

02:38.230 --> 02:39.891
I know. Me too.

02:41.066 --> 02:42.465
I want you, Russell.

02:42.634 --> 02:43.965
All of you.

02:44.136 --> 02:46.036
- Inside me.
- Yes.

03:20.405 --> 03:24.000
So you were the one
who found the bodies?

03:24.543 --> 03:29.105
There was blood everywhere
and other stuff.

03:30.949 --> 03:33.543
I think Alice was already dead.

03:34.186 --> 03:35.813
But Russell wasn't?

03:36.621 --> 03:38.589
I think he was, mostly.

03:38.757 --> 03:45.185
Except he was still
sort of chewing a little.

03:46.464 --> 03:47.488
Oh...

03:49.000 --> 03:50.467
Uh-huh.

03:52.070 --> 03:54.436
How could two people even do that?

03:54.606 --> 03:56.039
Eat each other to death?

03:56.208 --> 03:58.039
It's a really good question.

03:58.210 --> 04:01.805
Now, the last few days,
did you notice her acting erratically?

04:01.980 --> 04:05.347
- How do you mean?
- I mean, did she seem unusually hostile?

04:05.517 --> 04:08.179
- Aggressive?
- No way.

04:08.687 --> 04:11.815
Alice never drank. Never even swore.

04:11.990 --> 04:16.154
She was a nice girl
And I'm talking, like, a nice girl.

04:16.661 --> 04:19.528
She still had her promise ring,
if you know what I mean.

04:19.964 --> 04:21.956
- She was a virgin?
- No premarital.

04:22.667 --> 04:24.965
I used to wonder how she did it.

04:25.136 --> 04:27.832
I mean, you know, didn't do it.

04:32.911 --> 04:34.811
It was her first date in months.

04:36.147 --> 04:38.707
She was so excited.

04:39.618 --> 04:42.212
Apparently,
they were both pretty excited.

04:47.626 --> 04:49.218
- How did it go?
- Oh.

04:50.028 --> 04:51.757
No EMF, no sulphur.

04:52.731 --> 04:54.756
Ghost possession
and demonic possession...

04:54.933 --> 04:55.991
...are probably out.

04:56.201 --> 04:59.034
- Huh, that's where I was putting my money.
- Nope.

04:59.204 --> 05:01.229
Well, then what, then?

05:01.406 --> 05:04.898
Dude, at the coroner's,
you didn't see these bodies.

05:05.076 --> 05:09.206
I mean, these two started eating
and they just kept going.

05:10.015 --> 05:12.006
I mean, their stomachs were full.

05:12.183 --> 05:14.777
Like Thanksgiving dinner full.

05:14.953 --> 05:16.420
Talk about codependent.

05:17.155 --> 05:21.023
Well, I mean, we got our feelers out.

05:21.192 --> 05:23.353
Not much more we can do tonight.

05:24.162 --> 05:26.926
All right.
I'm just gonna go through some files.

05:27.098 --> 05:30.033
- You can go ahead and get going.
- Sorry?

05:31.036 --> 05:32.867
Go ahead. Unleash the kraken.

05:33.038 --> 05:35.029
See you tomorrow morning.

05:36.174 --> 05:38.472
- Where am I going?
- Dean, it's Valentine's Day.

05:38.677 --> 05:42.044
Your favorite holiday, remember?
I mean, what do you always call it?

05:42.213 --> 05:45.114
- Unattached drifter Christmas.
- Yeah.

05:46.184 --> 05:47.412
Oh, yeah. Well.

05:47.919 --> 05:51.548
Be that as it may, I don't know.

05:52.590 --> 05:54.751
I guess I'm not feeling it this year.

05:55.260 --> 05:57.626
So you're not into bars
full of Ionely women?

05:59.564 --> 06:00.895
No, I guess not.

06:03.468 --> 06:06.164
- What?
- It's when a dog doesn't eat.

06:06.338 --> 06:08.829
That's when you know
something is really wrong.

06:09.341 --> 06:11.673
Remarkably patronizing concern
duly noted.

06:11.843 --> 06:14.835
Nothing is wrong.
Are we gonna work or what?

06:25.123 --> 06:26.147
Ouch.

06:27.625 --> 06:30.116
- You even proofing this thing, Jimbo?
- Sorry?

06:30.762 --> 06:34.163
Tell me you are not checking
your cell phone again.

06:34.332 --> 06:36.766
- She's got you on a leash.
- I'm not on a leash.

06:36.935 --> 06:39.267
- She just wants to know where I am.
- She wants to know you're whipped.

06:39.437 --> 06:41.598
- It's not like that.
- Oh, yeah. It's like:

06:43.108 --> 06:45.269
- Brad, just give me two minutes.
No, man. No.

06:45.443 --> 06:48.207
I'm the project leader.
And I'm not gonna half-ass it...

06:48.380 --> 06:52.680
...because my wingman has gone mental
over some chick he met a week ago.

06:53.818 --> 06:54.944
Jim?

06:56.554 --> 06:58.488
Holy crap.

06:59.391 --> 07:00.619
Where were you?

07:01.459 --> 07:03.620
I know. It's just I had to...

07:03.795 --> 07:07.629
You can't choose work over me, Jim.

07:07.799 --> 07:10.290
I won't, Janice. I'm sorry.

07:10.468 --> 07:14.666
Whoa, whoa. Jimbo,
due respect, but honestly, bro:

07:18.810 --> 07:20.300
What are we gonna do, Jimmy?

07:20.478 --> 07:21.536
I don't know, baby.

07:21.713 --> 07:26.013
Seems like whatever we do, something
is always gonna keep us apart.

07:26.317 --> 07:29.286
Work, family, sleep.

07:30.054 --> 07:31.544
Now prison maybe.

07:33.691 --> 07:35.318
Maybe.

07:37.028 --> 07:38.655
But I think I have an idea.

07:40.298 --> 07:44.029
How we can stay together forever.

08:17.869 --> 08:20.269
- You okay?
- Yeah. I'm fine.

08:30.915 --> 08:33.941
Agent Marley,
you just can't stay away.

08:34.118 --> 08:37.246
- You tagged another double suicide.
- I just finished closing.

08:37.422 --> 08:39.390
This is my partner,
Special Agent Cliff.

08:39.557 --> 08:42.082
Agent Cliff. Finished my prelims.

08:42.260 --> 08:46.128
I pulled the organ sets
and sent off the tox samples.

08:46.297 --> 08:48.162
- Mind if we take a look?
Not at all.

08:48.366 --> 08:53.133
But like I said, their good-and-plenties
are already Tupperwared.

08:53.304 --> 08:54.771
Super.

08:54.939 --> 08:56.429
Just leave the keys with Marty.

08:56.608 --> 09:02.911
And please, gentlemen,
refrigerate after opening.

09:08.753 --> 09:10.243
Hey.

09:11.322 --> 09:12.414
Be my Valentine?

09:17.595 --> 09:20.029
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a second.

09:26.037 --> 09:28.437
These hearts both have
identical marks.

09:30.141 --> 09:31.165
Check this out.

09:32.176 --> 09:33.837
It looks like some kind of letter.

09:35.513 --> 09:36.639
Oh, no.

09:38.016 --> 09:39.506
What?

09:41.486 --> 09:44.011
I think it's Enochian.

09:44.188 --> 09:46.452
You mean like angel scratches?

09:49.193 --> 09:51.024
So it's like the tagging on our ribs?

09:51.195 --> 09:52.492
Dean, I don't know.

09:52.664 --> 09:54.188
Oh, hell.

09:59.571 --> 10:00.799
Cass, it's Dean.

10:01.539 --> 10:05.134
Yeah. Room 31C, basement level,
St. James Medical Center.

10:05.710 --> 10:06.734
I'm there now.

10:07.745 --> 10:08.803
Yeah, I get that.

10:09.681 --> 10:11.308
I'm gonna hang up now.

10:11.950 --> 10:13.577
Right.

10:18.856 --> 10:20.983
You're right, Sam.
These are angelic marks.

10:22.594 --> 10:24.755
I imagine you'll find similar marks
on the other couples' hearts as well.

10:24.963 --> 10:27.158
So, what are they?
I mean, what do they mean?

10:27.332 --> 10:28.924
It's a mark of union.

10:29.100 --> 10:31.591
This man and woman
were intended to mate.

10:31.769 --> 10:33.737
Okay. But who put them there?

10:33.905 --> 10:36.931
Well, your people call them cupid.

10:37.108 --> 10:38.700
A what?

10:38.910 --> 10:42.368
What human myth has mistaken
for cupid...

10:42.547 --> 10:45.175
...is actually a lower order of angel.

10:45.350 --> 10:47.511
Technically it's a cherub, third class.

10:47.785 --> 10:49.412
- A cherub?
Yeah.

10:49.587 --> 10:51.680
They're all over the world,
dozens of them.

10:51.856 --> 10:54.552
You mean the little flying fat kid
in diapers?

10:55.693 --> 10:56.921
They're not incontinent.

10:57.595 --> 10:59.460
Anyway, so, what you're saying is...

10:59.631 --> 11:02.099
What I'm saying
is a cupid has gone rogue...

11:02.266 --> 11:05.360
...and we have to stop him
before he kills again.

11:06.904 --> 11:07.928
Naturally.

11:08.606 --> 11:10.540
Of course we do.

11:26.924 --> 11:29.552
Just happen to know
he likes the cosmos at this place?

11:29.727 --> 11:31.786
This place is a nexus
of human reproduction.

11:31.963 --> 11:34.124
It's exactly the kind of...

11:35.166 --> 11:38.294
Of garden the cupid will come
to pollinate.

11:45.176 --> 11:47.804
Wait a minute. You're not hungry.

11:49.447 --> 11:50.471
No.

11:52.050 --> 11:53.244
What? I'm not hungry.

11:53.418 --> 11:55.249
Then you're not gonna finish that?

12:01.592 --> 12:03.059
He's here.

12:04.328 --> 12:05.818
Where? I don't see anything.

12:15.006 --> 12:16.496
There.

12:17.642 --> 12:19.633
Same-side-of-the-booth couple
over there?

12:19.811 --> 12:21.642
Meet me in the back.

12:30.588 --> 12:32.988
Cass, where is he?

12:33.157 --> 12:34.283
I have him tethered.

12:39.997 --> 12:41.624
Manifest yourself.

12:49.340 --> 12:50.967
So where is he?

12:51.809 --> 12:52.969
Here I am.

13:03.654 --> 13:06.088
- Help!
- Oh, help is on the way.

13:06.257 --> 13:07.724
Yes, it is. Yes, it is.

13:09.360 --> 13:10.793
Hello, you.

13:16.434 --> 13:18.265
- This is Cupid?
- Yes.

13:19.270 --> 13:21.170
- And look at you, huh?
- No.

13:21.372 --> 13:22.464
- Yes.
No, no, no.

13:22.640 --> 13:24.232
Yes, yes, yes.

13:24.909 --> 13:29.141
- Is this a fight? Are we in a fight?
- This is their handshake.

13:29.313 --> 13:31.440
- I don't like it.
- No one likes it.

13:37.488 --> 13:38.955
What can I do for you?

13:39.123 --> 13:41.091
- Why are you doing this?
- Doing what?

13:41.259 --> 13:45.025
Your targets, the ones you've marked,
they're slaughtering each other.

13:45.696 --> 13:47.254
What?

13:47.899 --> 13:51.335
- They are?
- Listen, birthday suit. We know.

13:51.903 --> 13:55.339
We know you been flitting around,
popping people with a poisoned arrow...

13:55.506 --> 13:58.907
...making them murder each other.
- What we don't know is why.

13:59.977 --> 14:01.911
You think that l...?

14:05.049 --> 14:06.107
Well...

14:07.552 --> 14:08.849
I don't know what to say.

14:19.730 --> 14:20.992
Should...?

14:21.165 --> 14:23.133
Should somebody
maybe go talk to him?

14:23.301 --> 14:25.826
Yeah, that's a good idea.
Give him hell, Cass.

14:33.711 --> 14:35.235
Um, look.

14:37.081 --> 14:39.709
We didn't mean to, um...

14:44.355 --> 14:45.379
Hurt your feelings.

14:47.625 --> 14:50.025
Love is more than a word to me,
you know? L...

14:50.194 --> 14:53.561
I love love. I love it.
If that's wrong, I don't wanna be right.

14:53.731 --> 14:57.462
Yes, yes. Of course. L...

14:58.769 --> 15:02.933
- I have no idea what you're saying.
- I was just on my appointed rounds.

15:03.107 --> 15:06.042
What my targets do after that,
that's nothing to do with me.

15:06.210 --> 15:08.474
I was following my orders.

15:10.081 --> 15:12.242
Please, brother. Read my mind.

15:12.884 --> 15:14.749
Read my mind. You'll see.

15:23.194 --> 15:24.593
He's telling the truth.

15:24.762 --> 15:26.229
Jiminy Christmas, thank you.

15:26.731 --> 15:28.028
Wait, wait. You said...

15:28.199 --> 15:31.134
You said you were just following orders.
Whose orders?

15:33.104 --> 15:35.572
Heaven, silly. Heaven.

15:36.507 --> 15:38.873
Why does heaven care
if Harry meets Sally?

15:39.043 --> 15:42.376
Mostly they don't. You know,
certain bloodlines, certain destinies.

15:42.546 --> 15:44.104
- Like yours.
- What?

15:44.282 --> 15:46.375
The union
of John and Mary Winchester...

15:46.550 --> 15:49.542
...very big deal upstairs.
Top priority arrangement.

15:49.720 --> 15:51.654
Are you saying
you fixed up our parents?

15:51.822 --> 15:53.756
Well, not me, but yeah.

15:54.525 --> 15:57.221
Oh, it wasn't easy.
Couldn't stand each other at first.

15:57.395 --> 15:59.454
When we were done with them,
perfect couple.

15:59.630 --> 16:00.892
- Perfect?
- Yeah.

16:01.065 --> 16:02.089
They're dead.

16:03.401 --> 16:06.632
I'm sorry,
but the orders were very clear.

16:06.804 --> 16:09.170
You and Sam needed to be born.

16:09.340 --> 16:12.639
Your parents were just meant to be.

16:12.810 --> 16:14.573
A match made in heaven.

16:14.946 --> 16:15.970
<i>Heaven</i>

16:18.115 --> 16:19.275
Son of a bitch.

16:23.120 --> 16:24.246
Where is he?

16:24.422 --> 16:27.050
- Where did he go?
- I believe you upset him.

16:27.558 --> 16:30.152
- Upset him?
- Dean, enough.

16:30.328 --> 16:32.455
- What?
- You just punched a cupid.

16:32.630 --> 16:34.461
I punched a dick.

16:35.499 --> 16:36.693
Um...

16:36.968 --> 16:40.495
Are we gonna talk about what's been up
with you lately or not?

16:41.639 --> 16:42.663
Or not.

16:55.586 --> 16:58.817
You said you wanna hear
about any other weird ones.

16:58.990 --> 17:00.514
Okay.

17:05.997 --> 17:07.862
Lester Finch.

17:08.833 --> 17:10.733
I pulled his records.

17:10.901 --> 17:14.734
This gentleman used to weigh
400 pounds or so until a gastric bypass...

17:14.905 --> 17:17.669
...which brought down his weight
considerably.

17:17.842 --> 17:22.973
Then for some reason, last night,
he decided to go on a Twinkie binge.

17:24.214 --> 17:26.580
So he died from a Twinkie binge?

17:26.751 --> 17:30.152
Well, after he blew out the band
around his stomach...

17:30.321 --> 17:32.551
...he filled it up until it burst.

17:32.723 --> 17:34.816
When he could no longer swallow...

17:34.992 --> 17:38.723
...he started jamming the cakes
down his gullet with a...

17:39.563 --> 17:40.860
With a toilet brush.

17:42.166 --> 17:45.329
Like he was ramrodding a cannon.

17:47.405 --> 17:49.498
So, what do you make of it?

17:50.674 --> 17:54.132
I'd say that it was a very peculiar thing
to do.

17:55.212 --> 18:00.707
So this guy was not marked by Cupid,
but his death is definitely suspicious.

18:00.885 --> 18:05.083
I just went through the police blotter
and counting him, that's eight suicides...

18:05.256 --> 18:09.215
...since Wednesday and 19 ODs.
Way out of the seasonal batting average.

18:09.393 --> 18:11.918
Yeah. If there's a pattern here,
it ain't just love.

18:12.096 --> 18:13.859
It's a lot bigger than we thought.

18:14.031 --> 18:17.762
<i>Yeah, all right. I'll see you in 10.
- Yeah. Okay.</i>

18:49.600 --> 18:51.192
I know what you are, damn it.

18:53.838 --> 18:55.305
I could smell you.

18:56.207 --> 18:57.265
Winchester.

19:32.843 --> 19:35.334
What the hell's a demon got to do
with this anyway?

19:35.513 --> 19:37.276
Believe me, I got no idea.

19:40.050 --> 19:41.779
You okay?

19:42.853 --> 19:44.377
Yeah. Yeah, I'll be all right.

19:47.124 --> 19:48.148
Let's crack her open.

19:49.326 --> 19:51.260
I mean, what's the worst
that could happen, right?

20:10.347 --> 20:12.907
- What the hell was that?
That was a human soul.

20:15.886 --> 20:18.320
It's starting to make sense.

20:18.789 --> 20:20.882
Now, what about that makes sense?

20:21.058 --> 20:22.548
And when did you start eating?

20:22.726 --> 20:25.194
Exactly. My hunger.
It's a clue, actually.

20:25.362 --> 20:26.886
For what?

20:27.064 --> 20:30.261
This town isn't suffering
from some love-gone-wrong effect.

20:30.434 --> 20:31.799
It's suffering from hunger.

20:32.169 --> 20:36.868
Starvation, to be exact.
Specifically, Famine.

20:37.041 --> 20:38.736
Famine?

20:39.076 --> 20:40.737
As in the horseman?

20:40.911 --> 20:43.539
Great. That's freaking great.

20:44.215 --> 20:49.084
I thought Famine meant starvation,
like, as in, you know, food.

20:49.420 --> 20:50.853
Yes. Absolutely.

20:51.021 --> 20:52.545
But not just food.

20:52.723 --> 20:56.819
Everyone seems to be starving
for something: Sex, attention...

20:57.461 --> 20:59.952
...drugs, love.

21:00.130 --> 21:02.758
That explains the puppy-Iovers
that Cupid shot up.

21:02.933 --> 21:05.527
Right.
The cherub made them crave love...

21:05.703 --> 21:09.104
...and then Famine came
and made them rabid for it.

21:09.273 --> 21:10.331
But what about you?

21:11.208 --> 21:13.870
Since when do angels secretly hunger
for White Castle?

21:15.913 --> 21:17.141
It's my vessel.

21:17.848 --> 21:19.213
Jimmy.

21:19.883 --> 21:24.081
His appetite for red meat
has been touched...

21:24.255 --> 21:26.155
...by Famine's effect.

21:27.091 --> 21:29.958
So Famine just rolls into town
and everybody goes crazy?

21:32.429 --> 21:37.128
And then will come Famine,
riding on a black steed.

21:39.503 --> 21:42.563
<i>He will ride into the land of plenty.</i>

22:02.026 --> 22:04.927
<i>And great
will be the horseman's hunger...</i>

22:05.095 --> 22:06.995
<i>... for he is hunger.</i>

22:16.507 --> 22:20.671
<i>His hunger will seep out
and poison the air.</i>

22:48.639 --> 22:51.130
Hungry.

22:51.308 --> 22:53.139
Famine is hungry.

22:53.310 --> 22:55.505
He must devour the souls
of his victims.

22:56.880 --> 22:58.541
That's what was in the briefcase.

22:59.083 --> 23:00.744
The Twinkie dude's soul?

23:03.554 --> 23:07.320
Lucifer has sent his demons
to care for Famine...

23:07.758 --> 23:10.420
...to feed him,
make certain he'll be ready.

23:10.594 --> 23:11.959
Ready for what?

23:13.997 --> 23:16.227
To march across the land.

23:35.386 --> 23:37.616
Hungry.

23:39.189 --> 23:40.850
Sam Winchester.

23:41.024 --> 23:43.254
The vessel. He's here.

23:44.495 --> 23:46.793
- Where?
- At the hospital.

23:46.997 --> 23:50.990
We fought, but he got away. L...

23:52.536 --> 23:53.798
I got this off him.

23:55.272 --> 23:57.706
Good. Yes.

23:58.542 --> 24:00.203
After lunch.

24:00.944 --> 24:03.913
Now, where is it?

24:04.581 --> 24:09.780
- Sorry?
- The one who loves cream cake so.

24:10.020 --> 24:12.215
Where is his soul?

24:17.294 --> 24:22.322
I'm sorry. No. The...
Winchester took the case from me.

24:23.167 --> 24:24.964
He had the knife. L...

24:29.139 --> 24:30.470
I lost it.

24:30.641 --> 24:32.575
But I'm hungry!

24:32.743 --> 24:34.005
I'll get another.

24:34.178 --> 24:35.236
I won't be 10 minutes.

24:35.412 --> 24:38.176
Hungry now!

24:58.602 --> 25:01.196
Delicious.

25:14.718 --> 25:15.742
Famine.

25:16.653 --> 25:18.120
Yes.

25:18.422 --> 25:22.483
So this whole town is just gonna eat,
drink and screw itself to death?

25:22.759 --> 25:23.817
We should stop it.

25:24.561 --> 25:26.529
Hey, that's a great idea. How?

25:27.831 --> 25:30.493
How did you stop the last horseman
you met?

25:32.703 --> 25:35.638
War got his mojo from this ring.

25:37.674 --> 25:40.040
After we cut it off,
he just tucked-tail and ran.

25:40.777 --> 25:44.213
Everybody affected here,
it was like they woke up out of a dream.

25:44.381 --> 25:47.350
- You think Famine's got a class ring too?
- I know he does.

25:48.285 --> 25:51.015
Well, okay. Let's track him down
and get to chopping.

25:51.522 --> 25:53.046
Yeah.

25:56.026 --> 25:59.462
What are you, the Hamburglar?
Developed a taste for ground beef.

25:59.663 --> 26:01.358
Have you even tried to stop it?

26:01.532 --> 26:04.194
I'm an angel.
I can stop anytime I want.

26:04.368 --> 26:07.030
Whatever. Sam, let's roll.

26:07.905 --> 26:09.463
Dean.

26:10.207 --> 26:11.902
L...

26:12.976 --> 26:14.466
I can't.

26:16.413 --> 26:17.437
I can't go.

26:18.382 --> 26:21.909
- What do you mean?
- I think it got to me, Dean.

26:23.053 --> 26:25.248
I think I'm hungry for it.

26:25.455 --> 26:26.479
Hungry for what?

26:26.790 --> 26:28.485
You know.

26:28.959 --> 26:29.983
Demon blood?

26:31.762 --> 26:34.322
You gotta be kidding me.
You get him out of here.

26:34.498 --> 26:36.329
Beam him to Montana.
Anywhere but here.

26:36.500 --> 26:39.663
Won't work. He's already infected.
Hunger's gonna travel with him.

26:39.836 --> 26:41.064
Well, then what do we do?

26:41.238 --> 26:44.207
You go cut that bastard's finger off.

26:49.279 --> 26:51.270
- You heard him.
But, Dean...

26:53.417 --> 26:55.851
...before you go, you better...

26:57.621 --> 26:59.646
You better lock me down.

26:59.823 --> 27:01.950
But good.

27:08.665 --> 27:11.361
Just hang in there.
We'll be back as soon as we can.

27:11.535 --> 27:12.763
Be careful.

27:12.936 --> 27:14.528
And hurry.

27:39.630 --> 27:41.495
Hey, Marty.

27:42.199 --> 27:44.292
Is Dr. Corman around?

27:44.635 --> 27:45.659
You haven't heard?

27:46.703 --> 27:47.795
Heard what?

27:55.412 --> 27:57.972
The guy's been dry
for the last 20 years.

27:58.148 --> 28:02.744
But this morning, he left work,
went home and drank himself to death.

28:02.919 --> 28:04.511
It's Famine.

28:04.688 --> 28:06.986
- Pardon?
- Would you give us a minute, please?

28:07.591 --> 28:09.786
- Sure.
- Thanks.

28:14.865 --> 28:16.730
Crap.

28:17.834 --> 28:20.496
I really kind of liked this guy.

28:25.742 --> 28:27.437
They haven't harvested his soul yet.

28:30.380 --> 28:33.406
Well, if we wanna play
Follow The Soul to get to Famine...

28:33.583 --> 28:35.847
...our best shot starts
with the doc here.

29:02.846 --> 29:04.609
Are you serious?

29:09.152 --> 29:12.883
These make me very happy.

29:15.859 --> 29:18.293
- How many is that?
- Lost count.

29:18.462 --> 29:19.656
It's in the low hundreds.

29:23.867 --> 29:29.237
What I don't understand
is where is your hunger, Dean?

29:29.406 --> 29:30.430
Huh?

29:30.741 --> 29:34.609
Slowly but surely, everyone in this town
is falling prey to Famine.

29:34.778 --> 29:36.473
But so far, you seem unaffected.

29:38.248 --> 29:39.772
When I wanna drink, I drink.

29:40.183 --> 29:41.775
When I want sex, I go get it.

29:41.952 --> 29:44.477
Same goes for a sandwich or a fight.

29:44.654 --> 29:47.452
So you're saying
you're just well-adjusted?

29:47.624 --> 29:49.888
God, no. I'm just well-fed.

29:52.262 --> 29:53.957
Look. There.

30:19.923 --> 30:21.447
Guys?

30:23.994 --> 30:25.894
Guys, what happened?

30:26.062 --> 30:27.427
I don't think it worked.

30:27.697 --> 30:29.358
I think I'm still...

30:32.169 --> 30:34.637
- Still hungry.
- Look at this.

30:34.805 --> 30:36.363
Someone trussed you up for us?

30:37.541 --> 30:39.338
The boss says we can't kill you.

30:40.510 --> 30:43.377
I bet we can break off a few pieces.

31:07.704 --> 31:10.036
Get him off! Get him off!

31:22.552 --> 31:24.543
Wait your turn.

31:41.304 --> 31:43.135
Demons.

31:46.209 --> 31:48.507
You wanna go over the plan again?

31:49.512 --> 31:50.536
Hey, Happy Meal.

31:51.748 --> 31:53.215
The plan.

31:53.383 --> 31:54.816
I take the knife...

31:55.151 --> 31:58.882
...I go in, cut off the ring-hand of Famine
and I meet you back here.

32:01.291 --> 32:02.622
Well, that sounds foolproof.

32:14.170 --> 32:16.434
This is taking too long.

32:50.640 --> 32:51.766
Cass?

33:16.499 --> 33:18.057
Cass.

33:19.469 --> 33:21.835
The other Mr. Winchester.

33:22.005 --> 33:23.597
What did you do to him?

33:23.773 --> 33:27.903
You sicced your dog on me.
I just threw him a steak.

33:28.545 --> 33:32.743
So this is your big trick, huh?

33:32.916 --> 33:34.907
Making people cuckoo
for Cocoa Puffs?

33:35.085 --> 33:38.282
Doesn't take much. Hardly a push.

33:38.588 --> 33:41.614
Oh, America.
All you can eat all of the time.

33:41.791 --> 33:43.588
Consume, consume.

33:43.760 --> 33:48.129
A swarm of locusts in stretch pants...

33:48.298 --> 33:51.062
...and yet you're all still starving.

33:51.234 --> 33:55.694
Because hunger doesn't just come
from the body.

33:55.872 --> 33:58.636
It also comes from the soul.

33:59.109 --> 34:01.100
It doesn't seem to be coming
from mine.

34:01.277 --> 34:02.869
Yes.

34:03.380 --> 34:04.870
I noticed that.

34:05.815 --> 34:08.375
Have you wondered why that is?

34:08.551 --> 34:12.385
How you could even walk
in my presence?

34:13.156 --> 34:16.648
I like to think
it's because of my strength of character.

34:17.127 --> 34:20.391
I disagree.

34:28.705 --> 34:30.070
Yes.

34:30.239 --> 34:31.764
I see.

34:33.443 --> 34:34.774
My.

34:34.944 --> 34:41.076
That's one deep, dark nothing
you got there, Dean.

34:42.652 --> 34:45.120
Can't fill it, can you?

34:45.288 --> 34:49.815
Not with food, or drink.
Not even with sex.

34:49.993 --> 34:51.358
Oh, you're so full of crap.

34:51.561 --> 34:56.931
Oh, you can smirk and joke
and lie to your brother, lie to yourself...

34:57.100 --> 34:58.260
...but not to me.

34:58.802 --> 35:02.568
I can see inside you, Dean.

35:02.872 --> 35:07.309
I can see how broken you are.

35:07.477 --> 35:11.675
How defeated.
You can't win and you know it.

35:11.848 --> 35:14.214
But you just keep fighting...

35:14.384 --> 35:19.219
...just keep going through the motions.

35:19.389 --> 35:21.152
You're not hungry, Dean...

35:21.324 --> 35:26.956
...because inside, you're already dead.

35:30.233 --> 35:31.461
Let him go.

35:35.105 --> 35:37.005
Sam.

35:38.741 --> 35:40.333
Sammy, no.

35:40.510 --> 35:42.375
Stop!

35:42.545 --> 35:47.505
No one lays a finger
on this sweet little boy.

35:48.384 --> 35:52.343
Sam, I see you got the snack
I sent you.

35:53.756 --> 35:54.916
You sent?

35:55.125 --> 35:58.322
Don't worry.
You're not like everyone else.

35:58.495 --> 36:00.895
You'll never die
from drinking too much.

36:01.064 --> 36:04.363
You're the exception
that proves the rule.

36:04.534 --> 36:08.868
Just the way Satan wanted you to be.

36:10.006 --> 36:11.837
So...

36:13.376 --> 36:14.866
...cut their throats.

36:16.546 --> 36:18.537
- Have at them.
Sammy, no!

36:18.715 --> 36:22.276
Please, be my guest.

37:05.128 --> 37:06.595
No.

37:07.197 --> 37:08.721
Well.

37:09.332 --> 37:10.390
Fine.

37:10.967 --> 37:14.835
If you don't want them...

37:15.205 --> 37:18.072
...then I'll have them.

37:44.634 --> 37:46.534
I'm a horseman, Sam.

37:47.437 --> 37:51.032
Your power doesn't work on me.

37:52.675 --> 37:53.972
You're right.

37:54.143 --> 37:56.373
But it will work on them.

38:48.398 --> 38:50.832
Help. Help!

38:51.000 --> 38:52.558
Dean!

38:52.802 --> 38:57.501
Cass. If you're out there, please, help!

39:02.645 --> 39:05.273
That's not him in there.

39:06.149 --> 39:07.446
Not really.

39:07.617 --> 39:10.245
Dean, help me.
- I know.

39:11.654 --> 39:12.951
Cass!

39:13.122 --> 39:17.491
Dean, Sam just has to get it
out of his system, and then he'Il...

39:17.660 --> 39:19.958
- Listen, I just...
Please!

39:21.297 --> 39:24.323
- I just need to get some air.
Cass!

40:13.182 --> 40:14.979
Please.

40:17.353 --> 40:18.877
I can't...

40:26.362 --> 40:28.353
I need some help.

40:32.902 --> 40:34.529
Please.

40:35.305 --> 40:41.594
