09:32.093 --> 09:34.443
who wasn't placing
a blood pressure cuff around it?

09:36.227 --> 09:39.143
Dr. Crane, we are very eager
to get the word out

09:39.187 --> 09:41.624
about our exciting newfaculty.

09:41.668 --> 09:43.626
Any chance you have some time

09:43.670 --> 09:46.716
for a short interview with
The Boston Globethis evening?

09:46.760 --> 09:47.978
[groans]

09:48.022 --> 09:49.545
The limelight.

09:49.589 --> 09:51.242
[inhales deeply]

09:51.286 --> 09:53.027
I thought I'd be able to leave
her hungry glow behind me

09:53.070 --> 09:54.376
in Chicago.

09:54.419 --> 09:56.508
"I would give all my fame
for a pot of ale

09:56.552 --> 09:57.901
and safety."

09:59.381 --> 10:01.383
Gotcha.
Well, if you're not into it,

10:01.426 --> 10:02.993
I'll just call The Boston Globe
and...

10:03.037 --> 10:04.299
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

10:04.342 --> 10:05.996
I mean, this is
my cross to bear.

10:06.040 --> 10:08.216
[chuckles softly]
I mean, my desire for privacy

10:08.259 --> 10:09.652
should be none of your concern.

10:09.696 --> 10:11.611
Eh. Professor Huntview's
also a very big get.

10:11.654 --> 10:13.047
I said I'd do it.

10:13.090 --> 10:15.615
Anything to help put Harvard
on the map.

10:16.659 --> 10:18.008
Mm.

10:19.793 --> 10:20.924
[keys jangle]

10:20.968 --> 10:22.752
[John crying]

10:22.796 --> 10:24.841
I've been waiting all day
for you.

10:27.061 --> 10:28.366
Eve.

10:28.410 --> 10:29.716
Oh, my God.

10:29.759 --> 10:31.065
Please... [panting]

10:31.108 --> 10:32.327
I can't pretend anymore.

10:32.370 --> 10:34.938
I-I just need one thing
from you.

10:34.982 --> 10:36.113
I'm desperate.

10:37.201 --> 10:39.943
No amount of desperation
will make this okay.

10:41.075 --> 10:42.206
I have to go inside.

10:45.906 --> 10:47.255
-Freddy.
-[keys clatter in bowl]

10:47.298 --> 10:48.386
Smells great in here.

10:48.430 --> 10:49.649
Oh, I made dinner.

10:49.692 --> 10:50.693
Here, have a drink.

10:50.737 --> 10:52.652
Thank you.

10:56.743 --> 10:58.701
-You bought a dining table?
-Yeah.

10:58.745 --> 11:00.616
Well, you said you wanted
my help picking one out.

11:00.660 --> 11:03.097
-Yes, but...
-And you also said
that if I found something

11:03.140 --> 11:05.752
that didn't clearly go
in my bedroom,

11:05.795 --> 11:07.405
you would welcome it.

11:09.712 --> 11:11.322
I did, in fact, say that.

11:12.584 --> 11:15.849
It appears to have
an electrical cord.

11:18.939 --> 11:20.418
Plug it in.

11:25.554 --> 11:27.599
[whirring]

11:33.823 --> 11:35.825
It's an air hockey table!

11:37.392 --> 11:40.525
By your logic, you think it
doubles as a dining room table.

11:40.569 --> 11:42.571
Oh, yeah. Sure.
It's space-saving.

11:42.614 --> 11:44.355
I mean, we need
an air hockey table.

11:44.399 --> 11:45.574
Indeed.

11:45.617 --> 11:46.923
And we also need a dining table.

11:46.967 --> 11:48.925
So, you know, two for one.

11:48.969 --> 11:50.710
Don't you love the colors?

11:51.711 --> 11:52.755
Which ones?

11:52.799 --> 11:54.757
It appears to have all of them.

11:56.803 --> 11:58.326
Oh! Dad.

11:58.369 --> 11:59.327
Please.

11:59.370 --> 12:00.415
Use a puck.

12:09.380 --> 12:12.035
Pass the salt, please.

12:12.079 --> 12:14.124
Nothing would make me happier.

12:29.096 --> 12:30.750
Mm.

12:30.793 --> 12:32.490
You're right. This could use
some salt. Would you?

12:43.850 --> 12:46.591
Freddy, this is all starting to
feel a bit passive-aggressive.

12:46.635 --> 12:47.984
If you're trying
to make a point,

12:48.028 --> 12:49.420
I wish you would just make it.

12:49.464 --> 12:50.639
Okay.

12:52.597 --> 12:54.512
-[horn blares]
-MALE VOICE: Goal!

12:54.556 --> 12:56.384
["First Call" plays]

12:58.255 --> 12:59.866
I'm assuming
that this is revenge

12:59.909 --> 13:01.911
for not wanting your weight
bench in the living room.

13:01.955 --> 13:04.000
Or any of my things.

13:04.044 --> 13:05.697
Only because, happily,
I can provide you

13:05.741 --> 13:07.047
with some nicer things.

13:07.090 --> 13:08.831
To you, they're nicer.
I like my things.

13:08.875 --> 13:11.225
Well, it's just that they're
a bit, um...

13:11.268 --> 13:12.748
Embarrassing.

13:12.792 --> 13:14.706
No! No, no,
they're not embarrassing.

13:14.750 --> 13:17.013
You don't want someone walking
into yourapartment

13:17.057 --> 13:18.972
seeing mystupid, garish things.

13:19.015 --> 13:20.843
You find them embarrassing.

13:20.887 --> 13:23.672
In fact, I'm not so sure
you don't find meembarrassing.

13:23.715 --> 13:25.543
Oh, that is
absolutely ludicrous.

13:25.587 --> 13:28.372
It's just that I believe that
my Loetz Austrian Art Nouveau

13:28.416 --> 13:31.201
iridescent glass vase
might clash ever so slightly

13:31.245 --> 13:33.203
with your box of dirt.

13:33.247 --> 13:34.944
That box of dirt

13:34.988 --> 13:37.120
is from Fenway 2013.

13:37.164 --> 13:38.992
The Sox were in that dirt.

13:39.035 --> 13:42.082
I want to understand
why that's important.

13:44.084 --> 13:47.696
But to me, it just sounds like
a laundry problem.

13:47.739 --> 13:51.352
David Ortiz made MVP
of the World Series

13:51.395 --> 13:53.180
in that dirt. "Big Papi."

13:53.223 --> 13:55.922
Well, good for him...

13:55.965 --> 13:57.358
big sonny.

13:57.401 --> 13:58.881
[scoffs]

13:58.925 --> 14:01.014
What? What? Where are you going?

14:01.057 --> 14:02.929
To the bar.
I'm gonna meet some friends.

14:02.972 --> 14:06.062
And when I get back, I think
I should move back in with Eve.

14:06.106 --> 14:08.978
I mean, you like the idea of us
living together and bonding,

14:09.022 --> 14:10.893
but you obviously don't want
me here.

14:10.937 --> 14:12.199
Of course I do!

14:12.242 --> 14:14.375
-Freddy!
-[horn blares]

14:14.418 --> 14:16.943
MALE VOICE: And that's
the end of the period!

14:23.601 --> 14:26.561
Is that reporter here yet?
I've brought two looks.

14:26.604 --> 14:29.781
One serious, one fun. Both gray.

14:29.825 --> 14:31.783
Frasier, look at this.

14:31.827 --> 14:34.438
Found a wonderful picture
of us both from our Oxford days.

14:34.482 --> 14:36.484
-Oh, Alan, the memories.
-[chuckles]

14:36.527 --> 14:39.008
I love it. [laughs]

14:39.052 --> 14:40.662
That's not me.

14:40.705 --> 14:42.577
Really?

14:42.620 --> 14:44.144
This isn't even you.

14:46.102 --> 14:47.364
Huh.

14:52.195 --> 14:53.936
Are you all right?

14:53.980 --> 14:56.678
Oh, it's Freddy.

14:56.721 --> 14:58.810
He's regressing
into an angry teen.

14:58.854 --> 15:00.421
What's he angry about?

15:00.464 --> 15:02.292
That I don't love Scotch
out of a plastic jug

15:02.336 --> 15:05.513
or a dining set designed
by Dave and Buster.

15:05.556 --> 15:07.167
You ask me,
it's all a bit performative.

15:07.210 --> 15:09.082
Honestly,
it's exaggerated disdain

15:09.125 --> 15:11.519
for anything remotely tasteful.

15:11.562 --> 15:13.173
Just like my father.

15:14.348 --> 15:16.437
Oh, I see what's going on here.

15:16.480 --> 15:18.482
[laughs]: Oh.
What does that mean?

15:18.526 --> 15:20.745
-Pretty obvious, isn't it?
-Please, Alan,
I'm not in the mood.

15:20.789 --> 15:24.097
All right, all right.
Not my call.

15:24.140 --> 15:28.101
I'll just write a few things
down in case I forget.

15:28.144 --> 15:30.668
You can do what you want.
It's no concern of mine.

15:34.281 --> 15:35.673
What are you writing?

15:37.023 --> 15:38.328
I don't care.

15:40.896 --> 15:42.506
What did you write?

15:43.551 --> 15:45.422
Let me guess.

15:45.466 --> 15:46.858
You think Frederick
gets under my skin

15:46.902 --> 15:48.295
because he reminds me
of my father.

15:48.338 --> 15:50.253
Some trite observation
like that.

15:50.297 --> 15:52.908
Not a bad thought, Alan,
actually.

15:52.952 --> 15:55.737
Can you blame me?
I mean, I loved my father,

15:55.780 --> 16:00.220
but he cringed
at absolutely everything I am.

16:00.263 --> 16:02.309
Can you imagine what
that's like, to have a father

16:02.352 --> 16:04.659
that's that embarrassed
by you...

16:08.010 --> 16:09.142
Okay.

16:09.185 --> 16:11.448
Okay, you made your point.

16:11.492 --> 16:14.364
I'm doing the same thing
with Freddy.

16:14.408 --> 16:16.540
He just wants a father
who accepts him.

16:20.153 --> 16:22.024
Oh, I see what you've done.

16:22.068 --> 16:24.809
It's a neat little parlor trick.
You get me to rev myself up

16:24.853 --> 16:27.725
while you write down absolutely
nothing at all, you...

16:31.381 --> 16:34.515
"Just wants a father
who accepts him."

16:37.431 --> 16:39.694
How the hell did you do that?

16:39.737 --> 16:41.957
Frasier, I've known you
for decades.

16:42.001 --> 16:44.264
I'm an eminent psychiatrist.

16:44.307 --> 16:46.483
Plus, on the other side,
I wrote down "mommy issues"

16:46.527 --> 16:48.050
just to cover my bases.

16:49.747 --> 16:52.054
I can't believe
I'm confessing this,

16:52.098 --> 16:54.404
but I hit my son over the head
with my Art Nouveau vase,

16:54.448 --> 16:57.755
suffocated him with
my Christian Lacroix pillows.

16:57.799 --> 16:59.931
[sighs]:
God.

16:59.975 --> 17:02.151
-I hate to admit it,
but it's true.
-Uh, Frasier...

17:02.195 --> 17:03.805
No, I've got to get this
off my chest.

17:03.848 --> 17:06.329
I lured my unsuspecting son
into my apartment

17:06.373 --> 17:09.854
with false promises, and now
there's no trace of him left.

17:11.595 --> 17:13.031
God, I'm a monster.

17:15.295 --> 17:17.558
Dr. Crane,
this is Jeneé Whitacker

17:17.601 --> 17:19.080
from The Boston Globe.

17:20.952 --> 17:23.346
Please, I have a family.

17:23.390 --> 17:26.915
Excuse me, ladies.
I have a hatchet to bury!

17:35.924 --> 17:38.187
Excuse me, sorry.
Uh, excuse me, uh,

17:38.231 --> 17:39.623
I'm-I'm looking for a...

17:39.667 --> 17:42.191
Oh, my God.

17:43.236 --> 17:44.715
Do you know who you are?

17:46.108 --> 17:48.197
-You're Frasier Crane.
-I am aware of that, yes.

17:48.241 --> 17:51.157
-I'm actually looking...
-My wife used to watch
your show all the time.

17:51.200 --> 17:53.898
It gave her the tools
to go after what she wanted.

17:53.942 --> 17:56.249
Uh, ex-wife, I should say.

17:56.292 --> 17:58.990
-I hope she and Leslie
are happy.
-Mm-hmm.

17:59.034 --> 18:01.732
And your show helped me
pick up better on social cues.

18:01.776 --> 18:03.125
Oh, very flattering. I'm glad.

18:03.169 --> 18:05.214
As like when I'm interrupting
too much.

18:05.258 --> 18:07.216
Which I understand. You should
be very proud, but I...

18:07.260 --> 18:10.045
You know who you'd be great for?
Our buddy.

18:10.089 --> 18:11.699
His dad died when he was a kid,

18:11.742 --> 18:13.135
and he still can't
talk about it.

18:13.179 --> 18:14.702
Oh, gosh, well,
I-I'm sorry to hear that,

18:14.745 --> 18:16.530
-but...
-Oh, there he is. Hey, Freddy,

18:16.573 --> 18:18.184
look who's here.

18:18.227 --> 18:21.926
It's TV's Frasier Crane.

18:21.970 --> 18:23.406
Yeah.

18:23.450 --> 18:25.321
[clears throat]
Hey.

18:25.365 --> 18:27.149
Check it out.
He's friggin' starstruck.

18:27.193 --> 18:28.672
[laughs]

18:28.716 --> 18:29.804
It's a pleasure
to make your acquaintance.

18:29.847 --> 18:31.240
Sorry to hear about your father

18:31.284 --> 18:33.938
dying when you were
just a child.

18:33.982 --> 18:36.550
Yeah, I don't like
to talk about that too much.

18:36.593 --> 18:38.856
-[Freddy chuckles]
-Goddamn it, Freddy.

18:38.900 --> 18:40.989
I'm not gonna let you be
a prisoner of your childhood.

18:41.032 --> 18:43.078
Excuse me, Dr. Crane.

18:43.122 --> 18:45.863
Now, process your grief
while we get a bucket of beers.

18:45.907 --> 18:47.126
Yeah.

18:49.650 --> 18:51.130
What you doing here?

18:51.173 --> 18:53.436
Surprised to see me
risen from the grave?

18:53.480 --> 18:54.698
Dad...

18:54.742 --> 18:56.222
I'm still talking, Oedipus.

19:00.878 --> 19:03.664
So, this is why you didn't ask
your firemen buddies

19:03.707 --> 19:05.448
to help you move.

19:05.492 --> 19:09.583
Because you're too, oh,
what was that word you used

19:09.626 --> 19:12.412
to describe how I feel
about you, when actually,

19:12.455 --> 19:14.936
it describes
how you feel about me?

19:14.979 --> 19:17.504
-It's "embarrassed."
-It's "embarrassed."

19:17.547 --> 19:20.507
I hope you're hungry,
'cause this irony is delicious.

19:22.161 --> 19:24.902
-How we doing?
-[laughs]: Oh. Yeah. Wow.

19:24.946 --> 19:27.078
Dr. Crane
just blasted open doors

19:27.122 --> 19:28.428
I didn't even know were there.

19:28.471 --> 19:29.733
Thanks so much, Doc.

19:29.777 --> 19:31.300
We'll let you get on
with your night.

19:31.344 --> 19:34.347
No, no, no, no, hold on.
We've just gotten started.

19:34.390 --> 19:37.088
-So, tell me, Frankie...
-It's "Freddy."

19:37.132 --> 19:40.048
Freddy. Um, tell me
about this father of yours.

19:40.091 --> 19:42.050
Oh, yeah,
I-I don't remember that much.

19:42.093 --> 19:45.053
You told me he was a pipe fitter
from Dorchester.

19:45.096 --> 19:46.489
Other than that, you said he was

19:46.533 --> 19:48.143
this completely
forgettable nobody

19:48.187 --> 19:50.711
who really never made
an impression on anyone.

19:50.754 --> 19:53.714
[laughs]: I-I don't think
I said that, Moose.

19:53.757 --> 19:56.978
No, I remember
'cause it really broke my heart.

19:57.021 --> 19:59.328
-I'm kind of an empath.
-Mm.

19:59.372 --> 20:01.939
And the way your dad died,

20:01.983 --> 20:05.987
impaled by that
falling radio antenna. Mm.

20:06.030 --> 20:08.729
No symbolism to unpack there.

20:10.513 --> 20:12.646
Sounds like your father
was a big disappointment to you.

20:12.689 --> 20:15.126
No, he...

20:15.170 --> 20:18.565
He could sometimes just be
a little hard to be around.

20:18.608 --> 20:20.175
How so?

20:20.219 --> 20:22.046
Oh, I don't know,
as a totally random example,

20:22.090 --> 20:24.440
uh, let's say
he's the kind of guy who,

20:24.484 --> 20:27.487
if you're out with some friends,
maybe having a few beers,

20:27.530 --> 20:30.838
suddenly he shows up
and takes over the entire room.

20:30.881 --> 20:32.492
[scoffs] Jerk.

20:35.277 --> 20:37.888
Must have been rather difficult
for you, living in that shadow.

20:37.932 --> 20:39.629
It was.

20:39.673 --> 20:42.023
Everybody was always
so wowed by him.

20:42.066 --> 20:44.721
I mean, I know I was. That...

20:44.765 --> 20:46.680
That didn't leave
a lot of space for...

20:47.681 --> 20:49.944
-For you.
-[sighs]

20:51.946 --> 20:53.774
And then I guess
I kind of lashed out.

20:53.817 --> 20:55.776
Who wouldn't? [chuckles]

20:55.819 --> 20:57.604
It's understandable.

20:57.647 --> 21:00.694
Your father left no room in
the home for your personality.

21:02.565 --> 21:07.440
If he were alive today, I'm sure
he would say that he was sorry.

21:10.443 --> 21:13.663
I hate to poke holes,

21:13.707 --> 21:15.752
but if your dad died
when you were so little

21:15.796 --> 21:17.363
you don't remember him,

21:17.406 --> 21:20.844
how were you overwhelmed
by his big personality?

21:20.888 --> 21:25.153
And also, your dad was
a pipe fitter from Dorchester?

21:25.196 --> 21:27.286
'Cause you told me
he was a plumber from Mattapan,

21:27.329 --> 21:29.549
which could not
be more different.

21:30.767 --> 21:35.337
Freddy, I don't even want
to think about this,

21:35.381 --> 21:37.731
but have you been lying to us
about your dad?

21:37.774 --> 21:42.910
And worse, wasting the valuable
time of Dr. Frasier Crane?

21:42.953 --> 21:44.912
You know what, guys? We don't
need to talk about this.

21:44.955 --> 21:46.522
-You know...
-No, if I may...

21:46.566 --> 21:50.483
There is only one person
to blame for this confusion,

21:50.526 --> 21:51.788
and it's not Freddy.

21:54.443 --> 21:56.315
It's Freddy's mother.

21:59.492 --> 22:03.147
You see, Freddy's mother
spoke so often about his father.

22:03.191 --> 22:04.975
As the legend grew,
the details of his life,

22:05.019 --> 22:07.761
as relayed by his mother,
changed constantly.

22:07.804 --> 22:09.632
One minute a plumber,
another a-a pipe fitter.

22:09.676 --> 22:12.940
And that is because she actually
did not know herself.

22:12.983 --> 22:16.509
Because the truth is, she wasn't
sure who his father was.

22:20.469 --> 22:23.342
She had narrowed it down
to three.

22:23.385 --> 22:26.301
-Mamma mia.
-Precisely.

22:26.345 --> 22:28.085
No, that's the plot
of Mamma Mia!

22:32.873 --> 22:36.703
Pipe fitter from Dorchester,
a plumber from Mattapan

22:36.746 --> 22:40.054
and a dashing psychiatrist
from Cambridge.

22:40.097 --> 22:44.014
You see, only recently,
DNA testing was completed.

22:44.058 --> 22:46.626
I know this
because two weeks ago,

22:46.669 --> 22:48.802
I received a letter
in Chicago...

22:50.586 --> 22:53.502
...which is why I am here
this evening in Boston.

22:53.546 --> 22:56.070
-You mean...?
-Yes.

22:56.113 --> 22:57.767
Frederick Crane...

22:57.811 --> 22:59.943
I'm your father.

22:59.987 --> 23:02.032
[cheering, applause]

23:07.647 --> 23:09.736
Why is this called "scooch"?

23:11.694 --> 23:14.175
'Cause they can't
legally call it Scotch.

23:14.218 --> 23:17.439
"Distilled in Orlando."

23:19.441 --> 23:21.530
So, how long before
your friends figure out

23:21.574 --> 23:23.663
we've always had
the same last name?

23:23.706 --> 23:25.360
Well, they didn't question us
already living together

23:25.404 --> 23:28.102
when they came to get
the air hockey table, so...

23:28.145 --> 23:30.191
I think we're good.

23:30.234 --> 23:33.934
I know I can be
a bit overbearing sometimes.

23:33.977 --> 23:37.720
And I know that it mostly comes
from a good place.

23:39.069 --> 23:40.723
[sighs]

23:40.767 --> 23:42.986
Sorry you left Harvard
because you were in my shadow.

23:43.030 --> 23:45.467
[laughs softly]
I didn't.

23:45.511 --> 23:47.034
I dropped out 'cause I hated it.

23:47.077 --> 23:49.123
Just didn't get along

23:49.166 --> 23:52.126
with any of those snooty,
pretentious eggheads.

23:52.169 --> 23:54.563
[chuckles]
They're not that bad.

23:54.607 --> 23:56.304
You make them sound like Yalies.

23:57.914 --> 24:00.656
I'm just more at home
with the guys at the station.

24:00.700 --> 24:02.919
I like those guys.
I'm like those guys.

24:02.963 --> 24:06.314
But my whole life, any time
anyone finds out who my dad is,

24:06.357 --> 24:10.057
I stop being Freddy and start
being Frasier Crane's son.

24:10.100 --> 24:12.451
And I didn't want that again.

24:13.495 --> 24:16.367
So you offed me.

24:16.411 --> 24:19.501
Maybe that's why I should
stick around for a little.

24:19.545 --> 24:22.069
I mean, how many kids
get a second chance

24:22.112 --> 24:23.897
to live with their dead dad?

24:23.940 --> 24:25.725
So you're staying?

24:25.768 --> 24:28.075
You know, I would drink to that,
except I-I can't

24:28.118 --> 24:29.990
have another taste
of this solvent.

24:31.818 --> 24:33.428
You know,

24:33.472 --> 24:36.257
I've been thinking
about your box of dirt,

24:36.300 --> 24:41.871
and I believe it will go nicely
on top of the piano.

24:41.915 --> 24:44.047
Really? You don't think
they'll clash?

24:44.091 --> 24:45.832
No, no, I think
they'll complement each other.

24:45.875 --> 24:49.009
Besides, if I can make a
chaise lounge après-Coco Chanel

24:49.052 --> 24:53.317
work with your grandfather's
duct-taped recliner,

24:53.361 --> 24:54.797
I can make anything work.

24:56.059 --> 25:00.455
Fenway, meet Steinway.

25:05.982 --> 25:07.288
-[knocking on door]
-I'll get it.

25:07.331 --> 25:09.333
I'm gonna get a fresh glass.

25:09.377 --> 25:10.726
This one's half-dissolved.

25:10.770 --> 25:12.380
[chuckles]

25:12.423 --> 25:14.382
-Eve. Uh...
-[sighs] Dr. Crane.

25:14.425 --> 25:17.254
About earlier, I-I just want
to clear something up.

25:17.298 --> 25:20.736
Oh, that's all right, Eve.
It's happened before.

25:20.780 --> 25:22.346
Other people figured out

25:22.390 --> 25:24.261
that your voice
puts their baby to sleep?

25:25.436 --> 25:26.873
Yes.

25:29.528 --> 25:31.704
-Could you-- I'm just so tired.
-Oh. Of course, of course.

25:31.747 --> 25:35.490
Being a single mom is not
as easy as everyone says it is.

25:35.534 --> 25:38.537
You may be a single mom, but...

25:38.580 --> 25:40.147
that doesn't mean
that you're alone.

25:40.190 --> 25:42.758
Trust me when I tell you
that Freddy and I are both here,

25:42.802 --> 25:44.760
no matter what
you may need, and...

25:44.804 --> 25:47.415
You know, it reminds me
of an observation

25:47.458 --> 25:49.852
made by one of
the great philosophers that...

25:53.247 --> 25:56.206
Funny, my voice
really does put John to sleep.

26:00.036 --> 26:01.777
And you.

26:03.039 --> 26:04.824
[sighs]

26:04.867 --> 26:06.565
Well...

26:06.608 --> 26:09.219
