Michael, what did you make
of Scottie Pippen's speech?

06:40.066 --> 06:41.400
So, you grew up with...

07:23.109 --> 07:24.193
And you believed him?

10:02.393 --> 10:05.563
Do you know that there's a deal
involving Seattle and Chicago

10:05.646 --> 10:06.856
and you're gonna be traded?

10:09.317 --> 10:12.612
Apparently, you're wearing the wrong hat.

11:18.511 --> 11:19.595
He's a rookie here.

11:22.098 --> 11:24.683
He get treatment like this
until next year at this time.

12:12.148 --> 12:15.192
<i>That's a nice thing to do,</i>
<i>to give a rookie a set of clubs.</i>

12:47.308 --> 12:53.105
Scottie Pippen signed a deal in 1991.
Do you recall the terms of that deal?

12:59.778 --> 13:00.696
Pippen!

13:02.072 --> 13:03.199
I worship you, man!

17:37.473 --> 17:40.100
Scottie could have gotten that surgery
after the season ended.

17:41.143 --> 17:44.646
He purposely did this late
to thumb his nose at management.

17:44.730 --> 17:46.565
Were you frustrated
by how he handled this?

19:10.315 --> 19:13.402
You know what he does? He sits back
and waits. What are you waiting for?

19:13.485 --> 19:14.611
Waiting on the double team.

19:14.695 --> 19:17.739
Why? You play aggressive,
they'll come and help you?

19:25.539 --> 19:27.958
Fuckin' Harp,
what you waitin' all day for?

19:31.628 --> 19:33.463
Toni, it's okay.

19:33.547 --> 19:34.756
You know why?

19:34.840 --> 19:36.758
'Cause I gotta scream at you all day.

19:55.944 --> 19:58.447
Let's go out and get our first win.
Ain't gonna say this again.

21:13.605 --> 21:14.439
Way to finish, man.

21:15.315 --> 21:16.316
Did I have a choice?

31:28.511 --> 31:31.139
Is there something to this business
of wanting a better position?

31:31.222 --> 31:32.348
Getting in the lottery?

38:45.364 --> 38:48.034
Before game two,
you played golf with Danny Ainge.

45:28.809 --> 45:32.187
Jerry, how close did you come
to dealing Scottie Pippen?
