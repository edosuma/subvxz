WEBVTT

00:01.055 --> 00:03.639
Because you gotta clear
the filters which you do...

00:03.931 --> 00:05.847
- After I ignite the en...
- before you ignite.

00:07.097 --> 00:10.555
- Is that a good explosion?
- Well, we were in it.

00:11.305 --> 00:13.263
We are all going back to Earth.

00:13.347 --> 00:15.514
Not if Mr. Judd
is on this shuttle you are not.

00:15.597 --> 00:16.989
Why don't you take
one of these things?

00:17.013 --> 00:19.931
- That came off pretty easy.
- It's like a movie set.

00:20.180 --> 00:22.180
Everyone, we're still on Earth!

00:22.263 --> 00:23.722
- No.
- We can just walk out

00:23.806 --> 00:24.681
of the airlock!

00:24.764 --> 00:27.222
If you wanna go out,
you can go out.

00:27.305 --> 00:29.055
No, no!

00:34.305 --> 00:37.347
- Is it my fault?
- Your arguments were confusing.

00:37.430 --> 00:39.138
I was trying to be nuanced.

00:39.222 --> 00:42.097
Well, I think you just nuanced
them to death!

00:51.097 --> 00:55.681
We just watched seven people
stupid themselves to death.

00:55.764 --> 00:57.472
At least they didn't suffer.

00:57.555 --> 00:58.722
No, they did.

00:58.806 --> 01:00.305
It would've been ungodly agony.

01:00.389 --> 01:02.055
It's Matt.

01:02.138 --> 01:03.597
What?

01:03.681 --> 01:06.389
"I have changed the codes
to the airlock.

01:06.472 --> 01:08.263
No one will ever use them again.

01:08.347 --> 01:10.597
No more deaths,
no more tragedies."

01:10.681 --> 01:12.055
That's good. That's smart.

01:12.138 --> 01:14.514
How are we supposed to jettison
all this stuff now?

01:14.597 --> 01:15.722
We need the codes.

01:15.806 --> 01:18.263
Or what are we gonna do,
just open the sunroof?

01:18.347 --> 01:20.472
That's dumb.
What Matt wrote is dumb.

01:20.555 --> 01:23.889
"I came here to fix people,
but I need to fix myself.

01:23.972 --> 01:25.847
You will not see me again."

01:25.931 --> 01:28.013
Oh my god. Does that mean
he's gonna top himself?

01:28.097 --> 01:29.555
I... I am...

01:29.639 --> 01:30.931
up to here with suicides.

01:31.013 --> 01:34.222
Guys, if we can't jettison
this stuff in the next hour,

01:34.305 --> 01:35.389
then we're all in this

01:35.472 --> 01:37.889
for the long,
three-and-a-half-year stretch.

01:38.013 --> 01:39.305
- Hour?
- One hour?

01:39.389 --> 01:40.722
Yes!
Or 60 minutes,

01:40.806 --> 01:43.389
if a longer-sounding number
makes you all feel better.

01:43.472 --> 01:45.597
- For some reason, it does.
- Matt, listen to me,

01:45.681 --> 01:47.555
you can't do this, all right?

01:47.639 --> 01:49.514
Life without you would be...

01:51.764 --> 01:53.514
Hang up.
That pause is really telling.

01:53.597 --> 01:55.430
The only word I could think of
was "easier."

01:55.514 --> 01:58.055
Um...

01:58.138 --> 01:59.764
Oh, fuck,
is this still recording?

01:59.847 --> 02:01.764
Now I've sent it!

02:01.847 --> 02:02.847
What?

02:02.931 --> 02:04.472
He's definitely
gonna kill himself now.

02:04.555 --> 02:06.806
Flood his inbox, so everyone
send him a message.

02:06.889 --> 02:08.722
Okay, flood.
Everybody. Everybody.

02:08.806 --> 02:10.806
Hey, Matt, it's Judd from work.

02:10.889 --> 02:12.222
Um...

02:12.305 --> 02:14.889
- Did you get my joke?
- Suicide never ends well.

02:14.972 --> 02:18.138
- You're the son I never had...
- Hey, sweetie.

02:18.222 --> 02:20.639
The lover I never wanted.

02:20.722 --> 02:21.722
My uncle killed himself.

02:21.806 --> 02:23.806
Why don't you call me?
We'll go do something.

02:23.889 --> 02:25.169
There's not really more to that.

02:25.222 --> 02:27.222
I'm not very good at this,
and you know that,

02:27.305 --> 02:29.639
so let's just pretend that I am,
and...

02:29.722 --> 02:31.305
Matt, those people
were fucking idiots,

02:31.389 --> 02:34.305
we're better off without them,
give us the goddamn codes.

02:34.389 --> 02:35.555
Iris!

02:35.639 --> 02:38.722
What? That's basically
what we're all saying, right?

02:40.263 --> 02:44.222
♪

02:54.597 --> 02:55.972
Well, that was, uh,

02:56.055 --> 02:57.806
certainly one of my more
eventful journeys.

02:57.889 --> 03:00.681
No, no, no, it wasn't.
Uh, the official line is

03:00.764 --> 03:02.931
it was a staggeringly
uneventful journey,

03:03.013 --> 03:06.180
and I am now totally fine.
Uh-uh-uh! Remain in your seat.

03:06.263 --> 03:07.639
What, you want me
to just sit here?

03:07.722 --> 03:09.013
Yes,
and keep the engine running.

03:09.097 --> 03:11.597
- It's an automated system...
- I don't care, shuttle man.

03:13.639 --> 03:15.055
Excellent work. Well done.

03:15.138 --> 03:17.013
I miss Sarah so much.

03:17.097 --> 03:18.347
If it's any consolation,

03:18.430 --> 03:21.847
the way her hand shattered...
I mean, it was beautiful.

03:21.931 --> 03:23.138
It really was.

03:23.222 --> 03:25.639
- How do you think he'll do it?
- Swallow broken glass.

03:25.722 --> 03:28.013
No, how would Matt do it,
not how would you do it, Iris.

03:28.097 --> 03:30.806
Wait, I got a new message
from Matt.

03:30.889 --> 03:34.138
"Sorry, just to be clear,
I'm not going to kill myself."

03:34.222 --> 03:36.931
"I'm going to
hide out on the ship

03:37.013 --> 03:38.972
for the next three and a half
years."

03:39.055 --> 03:40.514
Pick a fucking lane, am I right?

03:40.597 --> 03:42.490
This is what we're gonna do.
We are gonna find him,

03:42.514 --> 03:45.180
we're gonna get the code,
and we're gonna kill him.

03:45.263 --> 03:46.806
Okay? We're gonna split up
into groups.

03:46.889 --> 03:49.764
Uh, Spike, you go with...
Uh, you with Doug.

03:49.847 --> 03:51.847
Oh yeah! Boys on tour!

03:51.931 --> 03:53.263
Concentrate on Deck Five.

03:53.347 --> 03:56.347
Uh, Nadia, Billie, and Jordan,
you take H Sector,

03:56.430 --> 03:57.931
including
the peripheral horseshoe.

03:58.013 --> 03:59.305
It's... called the donut.

03:59.389 --> 04:00.972
No, it doesn't go
all the way round.

04:01.055 --> 04:02.555
It's... It's always been
a horseshoe.

04:02.639 --> 04:04.013
I call it a ringpiece.

04:04.097 --> 04:05.389
No, that's not helpful.

04:05.472 --> 04:07.722
It's not important
what it's called.

04:07.806 --> 04:10.597
But we call it
the "nearly circle."

04:10.681 --> 04:12.097
- Okay.
- Great.

04:12.180 --> 04:15.055
And now, the F Sector,
Frank, Mads, and Mia,

04:15.138 --> 04:16.222
including the galley.

04:16.305 --> 04:17.555
Okay, rest of you with me.

04:17.639 --> 04:20.055
How 'bout this
tough guy captain, huh?

04:20.138 --> 04:21.931
Alpha to the nut sack.

04:22.013 --> 04:24.597
- Proactive.
- Yeah, like a yogurt.

04:24.681 --> 04:27.097
Uh, Karen and Iris, you better
carry on with the jettisoning,

04:27.180 --> 04:28.907
because we're still short
of our target weight.

04:28.931 --> 04:30.180
We will be ruthless.

04:30.263 --> 04:32.097
But also, merciless.

04:32.180 --> 04:34.263
Um...
Aren't those the same thing?

04:34.347 --> 04:35.806
No. You need to be both.

04:36.555 --> 04:39.263
- Oh. Okay.
- Do the, um...

04:39.347 --> 04:42.305
"you do that, you do this"
taking charge shit again.

04:43.972 --> 04:47.055
- No.
- That's it. I miss that guy.

04:47.138 --> 04:49.347
Matt!
Can you hear me?
Matt?

04:49.430 --> 04:52.722
- Matt! Matt!
- Matt!

04:52.806 --> 04:54.597
- Matt?
- We should come up with

04:54.681 --> 04:56.555
code names
in case we get separated.

04:56.639 --> 04:58.055
Oh, that's an awesome idea.

04:58.138 --> 05:00.263
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Um...

05:00.347 --> 05:02.889
- I'm gonna be Cobra.
- Shit! That's a good one.

05:02.972 --> 05:06.013
What was I thinking?
The coupling.

05:06.097 --> 05:08.055
Doug and Spike.
They're probably gonna end up

05:08.138 --> 05:09.722
blowing each other in a doorway.

05:09.806 --> 05:12.764
- Can I be Cobra?
- No, man, I'm Cobra.

05:12.847 --> 05:13.847
I could be Python.

05:13.889 --> 05:15.305
Uh, that's just another snake.

05:15.389 --> 05:17.239
Cobra's just the best.
I'm not gonna beat Cobra.

05:17.263 --> 05:18.681
Yeah, I'm just gonna
call ya Doug.

05:18.764 --> 05:20.347
- But I wanted to look captainy.
- Mm.

05:20.430 --> 05:23.597
Seriously, my decision
to make a quick decision

05:23.681 --> 05:24.806
was itself a bad decision.

05:24.889 --> 05:26.806
I have
the decision-making powers

05:26.889 --> 05:28.681
of a pigeon
trapped in a library.

05:28.764 --> 05:31.639
A library. Why... why is
the pigeon in the library?

05:31.722 --> 05:33.931
I... I saw a pigeon
in a library once.

05:34.013 --> 05:35.472
It did not make good decisions.

05:35.555 --> 05:36.764
Matt, buddy.

05:36.847 --> 05:39.055
Hey, Matt, this is Mads.
Remember me?

05:39.889 --> 05:43.305
Kind of athletic build,
six feet.

05:43.389 --> 05:45.222
- Good complexion.
- Seriously?

05:45.305 --> 05:46.889
- What? I moisturize.
- No, I mean,

05:46.972 --> 05:49.597
you're seriously yelling
about how good-looking you are

05:49.681 --> 05:51.305
to a lunatic in the dark?

05:51.389 --> 05:52.514
Oh my god. You know what?

05:52.597 --> 05:54.764
- I think we gotta take a break.
- What?

05:57.138 --> 05:58.865
Hey, hey, hey. You blew it.
You blew it, buddy.

05:58.889 --> 06:00.889
Women don't like vanity in men.
It's emasculating.

06:00.972 --> 06:02.639
I'm just trying
to describe myself.

06:02.722 --> 06:05.472
I know. And Doug would not
shout that out about himself,

06:05.555 --> 06:08.430
- I'm just saying.
- Okay, well, Doug
doesn't moisturize his face.

06:08.514 --> 06:10.180
Unless tears count.

06:10.263 --> 06:12.305
- So, I'm like...
- What are we even supposed to do

06:12.389 --> 06:15.972
when he find him? Arrest him?

06:16.055 --> 06:18.013
No, we're not gonna arrest him.

06:18.097 --> 06:19.889
- Go on.
- So, I'm like,

06:19.972 --> 06:21.597
"If you want
a tight ten minutes, mate,

06:21.681 --> 06:23.597
go fuck your dog."
And then I left.

06:23.681 --> 06:24.931
I never went back.

06:25.013 --> 06:26.972
- That is gross. I mean...
- Billie.

06:27.055 --> 06:29.305
-Yeah.
-As soon as we've
got the codes,

06:29.389 --> 06:31.681
we need something from outside.

06:31.764 --> 06:33.555
What... What do we need
from outside?

06:33.639 --> 06:36.138
Joe's hands and his head
for print recognition

06:36.222 --> 06:39.138
in case Captain Ryan's
too crashy to dock the ship.

06:39.222 --> 06:40.389
Yeah.

06:40.472 --> 06:42.632
We're gonna have to cut off
Joe's hands for his prints.

06:42.681 --> 06:45.931
We're sending him out there
to dismember a corpse?

06:46.013 --> 06:48.263
Yeah. We need his handprints
for recognition.

06:48.347 --> 06:49.597
Oh, well, just making sure.

06:49.681 --> 06:51.847
Maybe bring back his ass?
That'd be funny.

06:53.347 --> 06:55.013
Goodbye, Sarah.

06:55.097 --> 06:56.889
Sarah, bridge crew.

06:56.972 --> 06:58.722
To control a ship,
you need to know

06:58.806 --> 07:01.472
how to control your emotions.
I do both.

07:01.555 --> 07:02.806
I'm sorry, Sarah.

07:02.889 --> 07:06.013
It gets lonely on the bridge,
but we love an audience.

07:06.097 --> 07:07.597
Come see how we fly the ship.

07:07.681 --> 07:08.889
Goodbye, Sarah.

07:08.972 --> 07:11.931
She had a dignity to her,
don't you think?

07:12.013 --> 07:14.847
How do I handle her?
The ship, that is.

07:14.931 --> 07:16.389
- A sort of...
- Come and visit us...

07:16.472 --> 07:18.138
potato-ey grandeur.

07:18.222 --> 07:20.180
To dust, Sarah.

07:20.263 --> 07:23.764
Sarah, bridge crew.
To learn how to control a ship,

07:23.847 --> 07:25.490
you need to know
how to control your emotions.

07:25.514 --> 07:27.472
- Look at them.
- I do both.

07:27.555 --> 07:31.180
Just ordinary idiots who went
out of an airlock one night.

07:31.263 --> 07:34.347
- I could've saved them.
- We tried.

07:34.430 --> 07:37.055
You know,
you can lead a horse to water,

07:37.806 --> 07:38.889
but you can't stop it

07:38.972 --> 07:42.138
from throwing itself
violently out of an airlock.

07:42.222 --> 07:44.555
You can, with the most basic
horse harness.

07:44.639 --> 07:46.222
- You could do that.
- Can you, though?

07:46.305 --> 07:48.305
- Yeah.
- Hmm.

07:48.389 --> 07:51.138
I'm the captain of a ship
that's leaking passengers.

07:51.222 --> 07:53.222
Hey, hey...

07:53.305 --> 07:56.305
I already lost seven good souls.

07:56.389 --> 07:58.180
I'm not gonna lose an eighth.

07:58.847 --> 08:00.222
- Eleven.
- What?

08:00.305 --> 08:02.138
You've lost 11 good souls
in total.

08:02.222 --> 08:04.430
Yeah, if you count
the other human beings

08:04.514 --> 08:07.430
who also perished on this ship.
That's a lot.

08:08.555 --> 08:10.305
That's a lot. Wow.

08:10.389 --> 08:11.389
Wait a minute...

08:11.472 --> 08:15.180
"Nothingness."
"White Light." "The Void."

08:15.263 --> 08:17.055
I think I know
exactly where he is.

08:17.138 --> 08:18.972
Oh my god!

08:19.055 --> 08:22.347
You're doing a detective thing
with the words. I love it!

08:22.430 --> 08:24.180
Come with me.
And you can call me Captain

08:24.263 --> 08:25.764
'cause I think I deserve it
this time.

08:25.847 --> 08:28.305
This is all good,
but we need to think great.

08:28.389 --> 08:31.263
Remember, weight is great. Okay?

08:31.347 --> 08:34.138
Um... Oh, this is the kind
of sacrifice we need.

08:34.222 --> 08:36.055
How many guitars did you bring
on this trip?

08:36.138 --> 08:37.263
- Nine.
- Oh.

08:37.347 --> 08:39.055
- Go grab 'em all.
- What are these?

08:39.138 --> 08:40.865
Oh, they're... they're stands
for my weights.

08:40.889 --> 08:42.013
- I don't need 'em.
- Mm-hmm.

08:42.097 --> 08:44.722
- And where are your weights?
- No, I need those.

08:44.806 --> 08:46.073
We need to jettison
excess weight,

08:46.097 --> 08:47.657
and you won't contribute
literal weights?

08:47.681 --> 08:52.681
Please. I personally threw out
Captain Ryan's rowing machine.

08:52.764 --> 08:55.806
I mean, he doesn't need it.
He's in great shape, but, uh...

08:59.889 --> 09:01.889
Is that true? About, uh...
Ryan's rowing machine?

09:01.972 --> 09:03.180
You went in his room?

09:03.263 --> 09:04.931
- What are you implying?
- Nothing.

09:06.555 --> 09:08.597
Some people are saying
you had a thing with him.

09:08.681 --> 09:10.031
But then, some other people
are saying,

09:10.055 --> 09:11.281
"No, they didn't have a thing."

09:11.305 --> 09:12.740
But then,
the first people are saying,

09:12.764 --> 09:15.430
"No, yeah, they did."
So... I'm just saying, there...

09:15.514 --> 09:17.274
There's a lot of confusion
around this issue.

09:17.347 --> 09:19.722
I would appreciate
a little less bitching

09:19.806 --> 09:21.972
and little more ditching, Iris.

09:22.055 --> 09:25.389
Okay. We need to ditch
the heavy-duty booty.

09:25.472 --> 09:27.698
- You seen anything like that?
- There's a reason they call me

09:27.722 --> 09:29.806
the "All-Seeing Iris."
Get out of my way.

09:30.472 --> 09:33.430
Oh. He's not here.

09:34.472 --> 09:37.430
Yeah... Why did you think
Matt would be here?

09:37.514 --> 09:40.180
Well, I thought I noticed
these clues in his room,

09:40.263 --> 09:41.681
these references
to the whiteness

09:41.764 --> 09:43.931
- and the void and so on.
- Oh. Okay.

09:44.013 --> 09:46.889
But the whole
of the spaceship is white,

09:46.972 --> 09:51.555
and the whole of space
is a void, so...

09:51.639 --> 09:54.055
That's a...
That's a very valid point.

09:54.138 --> 09:56.013
I think I may have
overreached myself.

09:56.097 --> 09:58.222
Hmm. Where are we right now?

09:58.305 --> 09:59.597
Uh, this is the antechamber

09:59.681 --> 10:01.389
- to the fusion drive.
- Ah.

10:01.472 --> 10:04.681
Why does the fusion drive
need an antechamber?

10:04.764 --> 10:07.347
- I don't know.
- Right. I keep forgetting that.

10:11.430 --> 10:13.347
- Hey! Hey! Hi!
- Oh!

10:13.430 --> 10:15.889
Uh... What's, um...
What's going on here?

10:15.972 --> 10:18.222
I've just been relaxing
in the spa...

10:18.305 --> 10:20.430
- Oh!
- Which is, um... still open?

10:20.514 --> 10:21.514
- I think so.
- It is?

10:21.597 --> 10:23.222
I mean, I'm telling you it is.

10:23.305 --> 10:24.931
Anyhoo, uh, what's...
What's happening?

10:25.013 --> 10:26.597
We're getting all our shit
together

10:26.681 --> 10:28.430
to throw out into space.

10:28.514 --> 10:30.931
Oh, sure!
I knew that.

10:31.013 --> 10:33.806
And, um...
uh, because I was, uh...

10:33.889 --> 10:36.847
- in the waxing place...
what am I like? Um...
- Oh!

10:36.931 --> 10:39.430
I missed something
about dead bodies

10:39.514 --> 10:40.889
flying out of the ship.

10:40.972 --> 10:43.472
Some people threw themselves
out the airlock.

10:43.555 --> 10:44.555
Oh, good Lord.

10:44.639 --> 10:46.180
And, um...
Would you say

10:46.263 --> 10:48.305
it was the responsibility
of any crew?

10:48.389 --> 10:50.055
No. No, not really, no.

10:50.138 --> 10:52.806
Would you be willing to swear
to that in a court of law?

10:52.889 --> 10:55.639
All right, if we threw
the pope's crown,

10:55.722 --> 10:58.263
you think we could knock
the portrait off the wall?

10:58.347 --> 10:59.597
Maybe.

10:59.681 --> 11:02.889
But we need the big-ticket
portable heavies.

11:04.097 --> 11:05.347
How 'bout her?

11:07.013 --> 11:09.430
Oh, baby. That is not a her.

11:09.514 --> 11:10.514
Oh, yeah!

11:10.555 --> 11:13.263
We're taking
your stupid fucking horse head

11:13.347 --> 11:15.972
- out of the equation!
- Iris?

11:19.013 --> 11:20.138
Rav.

11:20.222 --> 11:23.097
Is that it? Just a...
Just a simple "Rav"?

11:23.180 --> 11:25.639
See, I was expecting something
more along the lines of...

11:25.722 --> 11:27.013
"Uh, sorry for surrounding

11:27.097 --> 11:29.222
our groundbreaking luxury
cruise liner

11:29.305 --> 11:31.430
- with shit and corpses."
- Right.

11:31.514 --> 11:33.889
Shouldn't you be
at your workplace? On Earth?

11:33.972 --> 11:37.597
Rav, Karen Kelly,
displeased to meet you.

11:37.681 --> 11:39.597
I have a whole list
of grievances.

11:39.681 --> 11:41.239
I wanna run through them all
with you later.

11:41.263 --> 11:42.806
Don't you have a captain
to flirt with?

11:42.889 --> 11:45.305
Now, you stop this,
and you take me to Judd.

11:47.097 --> 11:48.889
This is nice.

11:48.972 --> 11:50.722
Yeah, we've got everything here.

11:50.806 --> 11:52.180
You want a drink?

11:52.263 --> 11:55.681
So, I was due to be in
a new TV drama.

11:55.764 --> 11:57.097
Oh, really?
What was it?

11:57.180 --> 12:00.222
It's called The Smasher,
and I play the Smasher.

12:00.305 --> 12:01.972
And why is it called
The Smasher?

12:02.055 --> 12:04.430
Well, that,
we don't want to reveal

12:04.514 --> 12:06.597
until The Smasher season four.

12:06.681 --> 12:08.972
But I assume it's because
you smash things.

12:09.931 --> 12:10.972
- Sometimes.
- Right.

12:11.055 --> 12:12.889
But I think we're gonna
try and make

12:12.972 --> 12:14.889
a little more complicated
than that.

12:14.972 --> 12:16.847
Yeah, I mean, that sounds...

12:16.931 --> 12:19.263
- Just, wow. Really.
- Mm.

12:19.347 --> 12:22.263
Um... I don't think I would
watch something like that,

12:22.347 --> 12:24.305
but I think
a lot of people would.

12:25.597 --> 12:30.472
Sarah used to say,
"Who's up for a drink or three?"

12:30.555 --> 12:33.972
Normally, the...
The phrase is "or two."

12:34.972 --> 12:37.222
A drink or two!

12:37.305 --> 12:40.222
I miss her so much!

12:40.305 --> 12:42.847
Do you think that maybe
you should tell her a joke?

12:42.931 --> 12:44.347
Just to kinda, like,
cheer her up.

12:44.430 --> 12:47.013
'Cause you're funny,
you do jokes.

12:47.097 --> 12:50.097
Well, I don't know if you can
cheer up a grieving person

12:50.180 --> 12:51.681
with a joke.

12:51.764 --> 12:54.013
At least, that's what they said
at my son's funeral.

12:55.055 --> 12:57.806
There you go.

12:57.889 --> 13:00.430
- You did it.
- Funny! Bleak, but funny.

13:00.514 --> 13:01.806
We need to go and look for Matt.

13:01.889 --> 13:04.263
Yeah.

13:04.347 --> 13:07.430
As if someone would want to
have a baby with you.

13:07.514 --> 13:09.889
Yeah. That's it.

13:09.972 --> 13:11.180
Poor Matt.

13:12.847 --> 13:14.514
Space is a cruel mistress.

13:14.972 --> 13:16.055
Mmm.

13:16.138 --> 13:18.180
You'd know about that,
wouldn't you, though?

13:18.263 --> 13:19.555
Super-Casanova.

13:19.639 --> 13:20.681
NASA-nova.

13:20.764 --> 13:23.097
- Have you seen the tall weirdo?
- Matt!

13:23.180 --> 13:24.972
It's not a life, Doug.

13:25.055 --> 13:26.347
What are you talking about?

13:27.806 --> 13:29.305
You've landed on the stars.

13:29.389 --> 13:31.138
Do you know what I do
for a living?

13:31.222 --> 13:33.430
I co-manage
a sporting equipment store

13:33.514 --> 13:35.681
with a diabetic racist
named Roy.

13:35.764 --> 13:38.347
Sure, but now,
I'm a Punch and Judy Man.

13:38.430 --> 13:41.180
I make balloon animals
for brats.

13:41.263 --> 13:42.389
And brats' moms.

13:42.472 --> 13:44.514
I don't even enjoy
the sex anymore.

13:45.972 --> 13:48.806
Feels like I'm slapping
wet concrete.

13:48.889 --> 13:50.472
Maybe I'm the balloon animal.

13:50.555 --> 13:53.514
No.
You are not a balloon animal.

13:53.597 --> 13:55.097
- Dumb losers say what?
- What?

13:55.180 --> 13:57.138
What?
- Oh, shit. We shouldn't
have said "what."

13:57.222 --> 13:59.097
That was the whole...
Dammit, good one.

13:59.180 --> 14:00.847
Where's your sex-crazed Russian?

14:00.931 --> 14:03.555
Ugh, he's Swedish,
and he's exhausting.

14:04.305 --> 14:06.514
Ooh. Ah.

14:06.597 --> 14:07.639
Rav?

14:07.722 --> 14:10.514
Hello, Douglas. How are you?
Gosh, this is awkward.

14:10.597 --> 14:13.347
Last time I saw you,
you were kissing my neck.

14:13.430 --> 14:16.013
Thank you so much
for trapping me up here

14:16.097 --> 14:18.639
- with Barney fucking Rubble!
- Mia!

14:18.722 --> 14:20.514
God, for the last time,

14:20.597 --> 14:22.722
I was legitimately trying
to help...

14:22.806 --> 14:24.448
- Oh, were you?
- Save this miserable marriage

14:24.472 --> 14:28.055
by sending him away from me
and you into orbit!

14:28.138 --> 14:30.239
Get your hands away from
my girlfriend, mysterious lady.

14:30.263 --> 14:31.555
Girlfriend?

14:31.639 --> 14:33.180
No, no, no, no!

14:33.263 --> 14:36.847
Hey! I know some street moves!
Okay?

14:36.931 --> 14:38.847
I don't want to use
my street moves on you, man.

14:38.931 --> 14:40.847
Let's...

14:40.931 --> 14:42.347
Guys...
- Where is he?

14:44.972 --> 14:47.722
I thought this was gonna be
so much hotter than it is.

14:47.806 --> 14:49.972
We're supposed to be
looking for Matt!

14:51.555 --> 14:53.055
Sensing a lot of tension
in this room.

14:53.138 --> 14:55.180
Every room you're in
ripples with tension.

14:56.555 --> 14:59.055
Come on, we're running out
of time to find Matt. This way!

14:59.138 --> 15:01.430
Get your head
out of his ballsack! Let's go.

15:01.514 --> 15:04.722
Why do I keep thinking
I'm clever? I'm not.

15:04.806 --> 15:07.472
On a good day,
I'm barely not stupid.

15:07.555 --> 15:09.681
- Matt!
- You are clever.

15:09.764 --> 15:11.597
I remember saying that to Iris

15:11.681 --> 15:13.472
the first time I saw
your headshot.

15:13.555 --> 15:15.055
Well, exactly. I'm not clever,

15:15.138 --> 15:17.639
but I look as if I should be.
Matt!

15:18.472 --> 15:19.806
Maybe I should shave this off.

15:19.889 --> 15:21.555
It's giving me delusions
of wisdom.

15:21.639 --> 15:22.681
Actually, you can't.

15:22.764 --> 15:25.472
Beardedness is stipulated
in your contract.

15:25.555 --> 15:27.013
Matt!

15:27.097 --> 15:28.472
Ryan. Judd.

15:29.764 --> 15:32.722
What... the fuck
have you been doing?

15:32.806 --> 15:33.889
Just, uh...

15:33.972 --> 15:36.347
you know, having snack attacks
and shrieking.

15:36.430 --> 15:37.722
Did you not hear...

15:38.681 --> 15:40.222
I mean, you're not even hiding.

15:40.305 --> 15:42.430
Well, we're all hiding.
I'm hiding.

15:42.514 --> 15:45.263
- You're hiding.
- You are.

15:45.347 --> 15:47.555
Wh... What the hell
was "the void?"

15:47.639 --> 15:49.555
- My empty tummy.
- Oh my god.

15:49.639 --> 15:50.889
That makes so much more sense

15:50.972 --> 15:53.639
than a random white room
with a big fan.

15:53.722 --> 15:55.806
Okay, well, Matt,
we need the airlock codes.

15:55.889 --> 15:59.138
No. I've been itemizing
my thoughts. Thought 309:

15:59.222 --> 16:01.722
"Every year, we pass
the pre-anniversary of our death

16:01.806 --> 16:04.764
but we don't even know it,
so we don't get presents."

16:04.847 --> 16:07.263
Seriously, Matt, we need...
We need the codes now, so...

16:07.347 --> 16:08.806
Thought 14:

16:09.389 --> 16:11.180
"Poor octopus...

16:11.263 --> 16:13.222
eight arms, but no hands.

16:14.305 --> 16:15.430
Fuck you, God."

16:15.514 --> 16:16.847
Yeah, that is a good point.

16:16.931 --> 16:19.806
The codes!
Matt, we need the codes.

16:19.889 --> 16:21.889
- Give me... Give me the codes.
- Oh, jeez.

16:21.972 --> 16:23.490
Where... Where are they?
What are you doing?

16:23.514 --> 16:25.406
What are you doing... No,
you stand upright, and I'll...

16:25.430 --> 16:26.430
No, no, no. You stay...

16:26.472 --> 16:28.389
All right, full report.
What is going on?

16:28.472 --> 16:30.180
Mom, you're sweet.

16:30.263 --> 16:32.263
Oh my god!

16:32.347 --> 16:33.722
- Hi, Rav!
- Rav!

16:33.806 --> 16:35.889
Not now, Ryan.
Oh, don't "Hey, Rav" me.

16:35.972 --> 16:38.472
- You need to apologize.
- For what? About...

16:38.555 --> 16:42.347
Oh, is this about the fact that
everybody on Earth hates you?

16:42.430 --> 16:43.847
'Cause I am against that.

16:43.931 --> 16:45.198
I'm sorry,
that's not good enough.

16:45.222 --> 16:47.138
I had to leave
an entire planet behind

16:47.222 --> 16:49.847
because a baying mob
wanted to bay me to death!

16:49.931 --> 16:52.847
My life on Earth
is buggered because of you!

16:52.931 --> 16:55.472
And all I'm asking is that you
just acknowledge that

16:55.555 --> 16:56.806
and fucking apologize!

16:56.889 --> 16:58.681
Whoa, whoa! You work for me.

16:58.764 --> 17:01.013
With deep bloody regret, I do!

17:01.097 --> 17:02.639
Iris!

17:02.722 --> 17:04.931
- That felt amazing!
- That's assault.

17:05.013 --> 17:08.430
Right! Right.
Yes, that is assault.

17:08.514 --> 17:09.889
Iris!

17:09.972 --> 17:13.138
- Why didn't I walk away? Iris!
- That's real violence.

17:13.222 --> 17:14.847
Right, who's next? You.

17:14.931 --> 17:16.514
You better give her
the codes, Matt.

17:16.597 --> 17:18.097
Violence is never the solution.

17:18.180 --> 17:20.430
- Just hit him. I think hit him.
- Oh, oh, oh...

17:20.514 --> 17:21.573
I haven't even touched you yet.

17:21.597 --> 17:24.389
I'm telling you the number.
Oh-oh-oh-five.

17:24.472 --> 17:25.931
Five?

17:26.013 --> 17:27.865
Cyrus?
Zero-zero-zero-five...
- For Avenue 5. I made it so that

17:27.889 --> 17:29.657
anyone thinking rationally
would be able to guess it.

17:29.681 --> 17:31.555
But anyone thinking
irrationally,

17:31.639 --> 17:33.514
anyone suicidal, would not.

17:33.597 --> 17:35.847
Well, I didn't get it.
Does that mean I'm suicidal?

17:35.931 --> 17:37.681
Because honestly,
just give me the nod,

17:37.764 --> 17:40.514
- and I'm ready to...
- Don't say that. Ever.

17:40.597 --> 17:41.681
Uh, where's Judd?

17:41.764 --> 17:43.639
He can't...
He can't have gotten far.

17:43.722 --> 17:44.907
He must be headed
for the shuttle.

17:44.931 --> 17:47.222
- What did you say?
- Oh, shittle.

17:47.305 --> 17:50.389
Mia...

17:50.472 --> 17:52.222
Since when is there a shuttle?

17:53.597 --> 17:56.389
What? All this time, I've been
unduly pleasant to everyone,

17:56.472 --> 17:57.806
and there was a way to get off?

17:57.889 --> 18:00.138
Can we ease up?
I have recent knees.

18:01.222 --> 18:02.889
Come on, people, come on!

18:02.972 --> 18:04.347
Faster, faster!

18:04.430 --> 18:06.681
We run out of time,
I'm gonna be taking names,

18:06.764 --> 18:08.138
room numbers, and teeth!

18:08.222 --> 18:10.180
Honey,
people do not respond well

18:10.263 --> 18:11.972
to threats of dental violence!

18:12.055 --> 18:13.472
Well, you do, Frank.

18:13.555 --> 18:15.347
Go, go, go, go, starbuck!

18:15.430 --> 18:16.472
Yes, sir.

18:18.222 --> 18:19.972
Go! Go, go, go!

18:20.055 --> 18:22.430
Yes, sir. We're going,
going, going, going.

18:22.514 --> 18:24.389
That button initiates prelaunch.

18:24.472 --> 18:25.681
The rest is automated.

18:25.764 --> 18:28.764
What the fuck
is the point of having a pilot?

18:28.847 --> 18:30.138
There is a second button.

18:30.222 --> 18:31.597
I shall press that
in due course.

18:31.681 --> 18:34.305
- Oh, good. That sounds fun.
- I'm Paul.

18:35.639 --> 18:37.472
Oh, yes! I've bagged him!

18:37.555 --> 18:39.555
This is what big game hunters
must feel like.

18:39.639 --> 18:41.156
If I was that pilot,
I'd have my finger

18:41.180 --> 18:43.180
on the ejector seat button
the whole way home.

18:43.263 --> 18:45.430
You guys realize I hear
every word

18:45.514 --> 18:47.472
you're saying about me.
It's very hurtful.

18:47.555 --> 18:49.514
Uh... Well, Mr. Judd,

18:49.597 --> 18:51.764
back on Earth,
people really hate you.

18:51.847 --> 18:54.389
So if you go back, you're gonna
get ripped limb from limb,

18:54.472 --> 18:57.764
and then bit of limb
from bit of limb, so...

18:57.847 --> 18:59.972
No! Me? Why?

19:00.055 --> 19:03.972
Uh, well, in order:
hatred, yes, you,

19:04.055 --> 19:06.347
and because you contemplated
mass murder.

19:06.430 --> 19:08.514
On second thought,
what's six months anyway?

19:08.597 --> 19:11.180
I was in my mom's womb
longer than that.

19:11.263 --> 19:12.639
It was great
getting to know you.

19:12.722 --> 19:15.097
Thank you so much for sharing
that story about your name.

19:15.180 --> 19:17.681
- He doesn't wanna go,
he doesn't wanna go.
No, no, no, no...

19:19.430 --> 19:22.305
- Boom. The hero returns.
- Yeah!

19:22.389 --> 19:25.222
Billie, your laugh.
It's a bit loud. Work on that.

19:25.305 --> 19:28.013
What? Where the hell
are you going?

19:28.097 --> 19:29.764
You tricked me!

19:30.639 --> 19:31.847
Okay, the sad clown

19:31.931 --> 19:33.989
seems to have misunderstood
what we're trying to do here.

19:34.013 --> 19:35.373
All right,
let's start this mother!

19:35.430 --> 19:37.514
Who the hell is he,
and why is he in Judd's seat?

19:37.597 --> 19:39.138
That is Jordan Hatwal,

19:39.222 --> 19:41.305
which is an anagram
for Huge Asshole!

19:41.389 --> 19:45.639
Jordan, I did like you,
but I am very, very weird.

19:45.722 --> 19:48.180
- That is true. She is.
- Where's the pilot gone?

19:48.263 --> 19:50.782
Just remembered I've got to, uh,
change the, uh, travel catheter.

19:50.806 --> 19:51.847
Fuck me!

19:51.931 --> 19:53.597
- Go on, go!
- What? What's happening?

19:53.681 --> 19:55.389
You're gonna drive me
back to Earth?

19:55.472 --> 19:57.347
That little boy's grown
into a man.

19:57.430 --> 19:58.972
He's got himself some fat balls!

19:59.055 --> 20:00.323
Our relationship
is more important

20:00.347 --> 20:02.013
than your lateral career move.

20:02.097 --> 20:03.764
- Jesus!
- Go, get in there, honey.

20:03.847 --> 20:05.514
Oh, my gosh!
I have never been

20:05.597 --> 20:07.263
more attracted to you
than right now!

20:07.347 --> 20:10.472
Oh, oh, oh. Hey! Hey!
Only one of you can go home.

20:10.555 --> 20:12.430
All right?
No one else sits that seat.

20:12.514 --> 20:14.681
Doug, I want you to go.
I want you to get home safe.

20:14.764 --> 20:16.639
No, it has to be you.
It has to be you.

20:16.722 --> 20:18.222
- Fucking love you, Mia.
- Oh, Doug!

20:18.305 --> 20:21.806
It never felt right to just yell
at someone like Mads

20:21.889 --> 20:23.347
and have him just absorb it.

20:23.430 --> 20:25.389
I also love you,
yellow princess.

20:25.472 --> 20:26.972
Will you shut the shit up?

20:27.055 --> 20:29.222
- Okay. Yeah.
- All that stuff about your laugh

20:29.305 --> 20:30.889
and then trying to get
in the shuttle,

20:30.972 --> 20:33.722
it was all just a joke.
An unclear joke.

20:33.806 --> 20:36.472
You know, Jordan,
you are an unclear joke.

20:39.847 --> 20:42.347
Hey. Did somebody order
the medieval feast?

20:42.430 --> 20:44.972
- That Joe's bits?
- I, uh, stripped him for parts.

20:45.055 --> 20:46.722
Did you only have a clear bag?

20:46.806 --> 20:48.531
No, it actually took me
a while to find this.

20:48.555 --> 20:49.681
It's biodegradable.

20:49.764 --> 20:51.389
So, unfortunately,
are Joe's hands.

20:51.472 --> 20:52.889
They burst in space.

20:52.972 --> 20:56.806
Poor Joe, he'd be so sad
knowing he's not useful.

20:56.889 --> 20:58.055
Handy.

20:58.138 --> 20:59.514
Will you pause

20:59.597 --> 21:02.097
the shitty
open mic night routine

21:02.180 --> 21:03.681
for just two minutes?

21:03.764 --> 21:05.555
I should definitely go.

21:06.263 --> 21:07.597
It's what Sarah would want.

21:07.681 --> 21:10.472
I honestly never heard her say
a good word about you, Nadia.

21:10.555 --> 21:12.597
Right!
No, no, no! What do you think...

21:12.681 --> 21:15.639
- No, no, no, no!
Get back! Get back! Mia!
No!

21:15.722 --> 21:17.722
Right!
That's it!

21:17.806 --> 21:20.180
My patience has snapped

21:20.263 --> 21:24.097
like a 200-year-old breadstick!
I've had it!

21:24.180 --> 21:26.555
I am the captain still!

21:26.639 --> 21:29.222
And I decide who stays
and who goes!

21:29.305 --> 21:32.138
You two! Pinky and Perky! Out!

21:32.222 --> 21:33.555
- Really?
- Go on! Get out!

21:33.639 --> 21:34.806
You have an anger problem.

21:34.889 --> 21:37.889
That's the captain I remember
from that headshot.

21:37.972 --> 21:39.430
- Are they coming back?
- Yeah.

21:42.180 --> 21:43.722
Matt, give me Joe.

21:46.847 --> 21:50.847
No... no, no, no, don't do that,
not now. Just give me Joe.

21:50.931 --> 21:53.389
Oh look, it's the Queen of Sheba
and the Frank of Sheba.

21:53.472 --> 21:55.931
- Look busy.
- So, uh... Whoa.

21:56.514 --> 21:57.389
What's that?

21:57.472 --> 21:59.514
It's a bag with some
of my friend in it.

21:59.806 --> 22:00.931
Okay...

22:01.013 --> 22:03.180
You're gonna need a cool bag
because that will drip.

22:03.263 --> 22:05.138
Karen, sorry,
I don't mean to be impolite,

22:05.222 --> 22:06.639
- but shut your piehole.
- Hey!

22:06.722 --> 22:07.847
- Frank.
- Frank.

22:07.931 --> 22:10.806
Just so everybody understands,
whoever goes back,

22:10.889 --> 22:12.639
takes Joe with them. All right?

22:12.722 --> 22:14.222
Okay, okay.

22:14.305 --> 22:17.263
Maybe...
Maybe you should go.

22:18.389 --> 22:19.389
What, me?

22:19.472 --> 22:22.180
Get some rest.
Watch some cricket.

22:22.263 --> 22:24.597
Why? Because I'm standing here
like this?

22:24.681 --> 22:26.222
You realize I don't usually.

22:26.972 --> 22:29.180
You're very unhappy.

22:29.263 --> 22:32.931
You know that thing you do
where you act sarcastic

22:33.013 --> 22:35.639
so we all feel sorry for you?
It works. We do.

22:35.722 --> 22:38.597
Whatever it is
you were trying to do,

22:39.180 --> 22:40.555
we appreciate that.

22:40.639 --> 22:41.764
I related to you

22:41.847 --> 22:43.514
- because you always fell short.
- Yeah.

22:43.597 --> 22:45.472
You know what?
Maybe I should be captain.

22:45.555 --> 22:47.347
It's... It's kinda weird
that I'm not.

22:47.430 --> 22:49.597
Well, I am moved by your faith.

22:50.764 --> 22:53.722
And then your lack of it.
And now, your indifference.

22:59.138 --> 23:00.138
Bye.

23:04.138 --> 23:06.180
All right, come on, Chuckles,
let's go.

23:06.263 --> 23:07.931
Yes, sir, I've...
I've pressed the button.

23:08.013 --> 23:09.514
All right.

23:09.597 --> 23:12.097
♪

23:20.806 --> 23:23.222
Billie? What...
Why aren't you doing the...

23:23.305 --> 23:24.764
Why do you think?

23:26.347 --> 23:27.597
Oh, fuck! No!

23:28.305 --> 23:29.889
- No, I can't go.
- No?

23:29.972 --> 23:31.931
You need my hands...

23:32.013 --> 23:34.305
to... to...
The big fucking steel...

23:34.389 --> 23:36.764
Because Joe's hands are now
pulped to buggery!

23:36.847 --> 23:38.347
- Yeah.
- No, I've gotta stay.

23:38.430 --> 23:39.764
But actually, this forgetfulness

23:39.847 --> 23:41.222
makes me think
maybe you should go.

23:41.305 --> 23:43.764
- Is he... always like that?
- Oh, yeah.

23:43.847 --> 23:45.514
He occasionally switches up
the accent,

23:45.597 --> 23:48.055
but for the most part, this is
what I've been dealing with.

23:48.138 --> 23:49.639
Maybe I should go.

23:49.722 --> 23:50.972
Frank!

23:51.055 --> 23:52.597
Okay. No, I'm good.

23:52.681 --> 23:54.931
Shut up, Frank, 'cause
the seat's got my name on it!

23:55.013 --> 23:58.972
What? Oh, does the seat say
"Smasher Fuckboy" on it?

23:59.055 --> 24:01.931
You know what? I'm done
with this hokey-pokey bull-S.

24:02.013 --> 24:03.931
All right, uh,
set port side jettison.

24:04.013 --> 24:05.430
Hit that baby!

24:05.514 --> 24:08.430
Jettison commencing.
Fifty-five, 54...

24:08.514 --> 24:10.430
You know, you've been
my least favorite so far.

24:10.514 --> 24:12.239
Well, you're not exactly
Audrey Hepburn, are you?

24:12.263 --> 24:14.514
- So let's just...
- forty-nine...

24:14.597 --> 24:16.681
Yeah, well, it is time
for the second button.

24:16.764 --> 24:18.097
Forty-six, 45...

24:18.180 --> 24:19.430
That was the second button.

24:19.514 --> 24:21.305
Shuttle launch commencing.

24:21.389 --> 24:23.222
Forty-one...
- Sixty...

24:23.305 --> 24:24.365
- forty...
- fifty-nine...

24:24.389 --> 24:25.573
- thirty-nine...
- fifty-eight...

24:25.597 --> 24:26.782
- thirty-eight...
- fifty-seven...

24:26.806 --> 24:29.263
What is this,
a barbershit quartet?

24:29.347 --> 24:30.681
This is like psychosis,

24:30.764 --> 24:32.472
but without
any of the advantages.

24:32.555 --> 24:34.681
Why would you use
your own voice?

24:34.764 --> 24:36.013
I have a beautiful voice.

24:36.097 --> 24:38.722
Iris, do you remember the day
that we recorded my numbers?

24:38.806 --> 24:40.722
Yes, you struggled to count
in reverse,

24:40.806 --> 24:42.639
so he counted up
and made us re-edit it.

24:42.722 --> 24:44.639
So genius.

24:44.722 --> 24:46.764
Okay, make a hole.
Judd coming through. Come on.

24:46.847 --> 24:49.263
Why am I going now?
I thought we all agreed

24:49.347 --> 24:51.639
that every living creature
on Earth hated me.

24:51.722 --> 24:53.722
Is it 40 or four for the launch?

24:53.806 --> 24:55.972
- Get your talentless ass
outta here.
- No, no!

24:56.055 --> 24:57.472
Thirty-one...

24:57.555 --> 24:59.806
- Airlocks open, yes.
- Judd!

24:59.889 --> 25:01.847
Get your talented ass in here!

25:01.931 --> 25:02.972
And jettison.

25:07.722 --> 25:08.806
I didn't touch anything.

25:08.889 --> 25:11.722
We just jettisoned
from the port side airlocks.

25:11.806 --> 25:13.889
We're gonna home in six months,
baby.

25:13.972 --> 25:16.514
That's the woman
who made me marry her!

25:16.597 --> 25:18.806
You jettisoned out of the rear,
not the port side.

25:18.889 --> 25:21.180
You said "port side."
It's the rear of the ship.

25:21.263 --> 25:23.305
The port side airlock jettison,
yeah.

25:23.389 --> 25:24.865
- No, the rear of the ship...
- No, the port...

25:24.889 --> 25:26.365
is where we were
jettisoning things out.

25:26.389 --> 25:27.615
- Oh, that's right. Yeah.
- Yeah.

25:27.639 --> 25:31.222
But no. Um... Because we had
so much stuff that...

25:31.305 --> 25:34.055
And there are five airlocks
along the port side

25:34.138 --> 25:36.847
and only two at the stern.
So it was more efficient,

25:36.931 --> 25:39.097
you know,
to jettison from the port side.

25:39.180 --> 25:40.514
No, the whole point

25:40.597 --> 25:42.514
is to jettison
from the back of the ship

25:42.597 --> 25:44.222
'cause that's what
pushes you forwards,

25:44.305 --> 25:46.138
in the direction you wanna go.

25:46.222 --> 25:48.389
You've gotta... shit out
of the back of the ship.

25:48.472 --> 25:49.931
This is basic shitting!

25:50.013 --> 25:52.138
Even babies know that, Karen.
They shit out the back

25:52.222 --> 25:53.239
- pretty consistently.
- Right.

25:53.263 --> 25:55.514
Karen, babies shit
from the back!

25:55.597 --> 25:57.722
I've seen babies do that.
They do it in diapers!

25:57.806 --> 25:59.406
Right, does no one teach physics
in America?

25:59.430 --> 26:01.722
- Somebody explain it properly!
- Cyrus. Cyrus, get on it.

26:01.806 --> 26:03.740
If you push on the left,
if you push on the left...

26:03.764 --> 26:05.639
- Then you p...
- you push... you change...

26:05.722 --> 26:07.389
- Oh my god.
- She gets it now.

26:07.472 --> 26:09.931
You have knocked us off course.

26:10.013 --> 26:12.347
I feel like I'm dying
and my teeth are falling out.

26:12.430 --> 26:14.806
- On our new trajectory...
- I don't wanna hear this.

26:14.889 --> 26:16.681
The soonest
we could even attempt

26:16.764 --> 26:17.931
a rescue from Earth...

26:18.555 --> 26:19.722
eight years.

26:21.013 --> 26:23.222
Iris!

26:23.305 --> 26:24.430
Get that door, Doug!

26:25.639 --> 26:28.222
No! No, you can't...
Don't... You can't...

26:28.305 --> 26:30.389
Leave it!

26:30.472 --> 26:31.681
The door is closed.

26:31.764 --> 26:34.055
Yeah, I like to have it
like that when we go to space.

26:34.138 --> 26:35.472
No, no, no!

26:35.555 --> 26:38.555
- Can you unclose it?
- No. No, it's on the auto-lock.

26:38.639 --> 26:41.514
That's short for automatic lock.

26:41.597 --> 26:42.764
Iris!

26:42.847 --> 26:43.764
I'm trapped!

26:43.847 --> 26:46.097
I need you to do something
really bad

26:46.180 --> 26:48.847
so that everybody looks at you
and not at me, okay?

26:48.931 --> 26:51.263
I feel like I've fallen
into nettles naked.

26:51.347 --> 26:53.222
Remember when
Frank pushed the button?

26:53.305 --> 26:54.472
Yeah! Remember that, right?

26:54.555 --> 26:57.514
Frank pushed the button.
What an asshole Frank is.

26:57.597 --> 27:00.055
I wonder which will go first,
the mind or the body?

27:02.472 --> 27:03.722
My money's on the mind.

27:03.806 --> 27:06.931
Detach. Detach.

27:07.013 --> 27:08.597
- Get away from the door.
- No!

27:08.681 --> 27:11.138
Too late.
It's officially too late!

27:11.222 --> 27:12.681
No!

27:12.764 --> 27:14.555
- Eight years.
- Fifteen, fourteen...

27:14.639 --> 27:16.389
- Eight years!
- Thirteen, twelve...

27:16.472 --> 27:18.889
That's longer
than the Beatles were together!

27:18.972 --> 27:22.180
Nine...
- That's longer than the Seven Years' War!

27:22.263 --> 27:25.180
- You no-good
fucking side shitter.
- six, five, four...

27:25.263 --> 27:27.597
- It's true. I am Frank.
- Three, two...

27:27.681 --> 27:29.430
- And I'm so sorry.
- One. Launching.

27:29.514 --> 27:31.305
Launching. Launching.

27:31.389 --> 27:33.138
- Launching.

27:33.222 --> 27:36.430
Iris!
You were like a coworker to me.

27:36.514 --> 27:38.138
Don't touch my stuff!

27:38.222 --> 27:40.180
Help! Stop it! Go back, go back!

27:40.263 --> 27:41.305
- Go back!
- Ow!

27:41.389 --> 27:42.847
This has been a horrible day.

27:43.764 --> 27:45.055
Iris!

27:46.180 --> 27:48.222
You think she can hear me?

27:48.597 --> 27:50.013
No.

27:50.097 --> 27:51.931
But you may as well
keep screaming.

27:52.013 --> 27:53.555
Iris!

27:55.931 --> 28:00.389
Iris!
