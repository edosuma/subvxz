00:05.005 --> 00:07.269
Good morning, U.S.A.

00:07.374 --> 00:11.140
I got a feeling that it's
gonna be a wonderful day

00:11.244 --> 00:14.077
The sun in the sky
has a smile on his face

00:14.180 --> 00:17.775
And he's shining a salute
to the American race

00:20.620 --> 00:23.987
Oh, boy
it's swell to say

00:24.090 --> 00:26.752
Good morning, U.S.A.

00:28.695 --> 00:31.960
Good morning, U.S.A.

00:34.968 --> 00:37.766
- Shoot him! Shoot him!

00:37.871 --> 00:40.203
Big Bird, just share it
with Cookie Monster.

00:40.306 --> 00:43.707
Don't trust him! He just pretends to eat
cookies, but he never swallows anything.

00:44.510 --> 00:46.142
Good morning.

00:46.246 --> 00:49.704
Francine, your negligee is see-through.
Unfortunately, you are not.

00:49.816 --> 00:54.446
Oh, Stan, doesn't today
have some special significance for you?

00:54.554 --> 00:56.454
Today? Wait!

00:56.556 --> 00:58.615
- Is today the 14th?
- Yes. Yes, it is.

00:58.725 --> 01:02.058
Good God! How could I forget a date
so dear to my heart?

01:02.162 --> 01:04.562
It's the big C.I.A.
Fishing trip.

01:08.001 --> 01:09.901
You're gonna do
the laundry anyway, right?

01:10.003 --> 01:13.131
Hmm! No time to poop.
I'll just do it on the way down the stairs.

01:13.239 --> 01:15.139
You're gonna
vacuum anyway, right?

01:17.110 --> 01:19.203
See you, Mom. I'm going to the mall
to try and figure out...

01:19.312 --> 01:21.246
how the piano store
stays in business.

01:21.347 --> 01:23.247
Hold up, Steve.
I'm going with.

01:23.349 --> 01:25.249
Whoa, Roger.
You know you can't leave the house.

01:25.351 --> 01:29.151
- Everyone else gets to.
- Well, everyone else isn't an alien, now are they?

01:29.255 --> 01:33.316
Whoa! Somebody had a big piece
of grouchy pie this morning.

01:33.426 --> 01:36.190
I just can't believe
Stan forgot our anniversary.

01:36.296 --> 01:39.732
- I would never forget our anniversary.
- We have an anniversary?

01:39.833 --> 01:42.927
October 25, the day you forgot
to put on underpants.

01:43.036 --> 01:46.096
Let's celebrate early.
Quick! Straddle mein bowl.

01:50.043 --> 01:53.535
Hayley, do Mommy a favor and put on
something less revealing.

01:53.646 --> 01:56.240
There is nothing inappropriate
about this outfit.

01:56.349 --> 01:59.284
Not if you're gonna spend
the weekend tinkling on Bob Guccione.

01:59.385 --> 02:01.853
Oh, God, Mom.
Were you ever cool?

02:01.955 --> 02:06.551
Oh, yeah, Hayley? Well, I pity
the fool who thinks I'm uncool.

02:06.659 --> 02:09.924
Get it? I was making
a Dr. "T" reference.

02:10.029 --> 02:12.224
Hey, Hayley, guess where
I'm taking you this weekend.

02:12.332 --> 02:15.233
Burning man

02:16.536 --> 02:18.436
It's this awesome celebration...

02:18.538 --> 02:20.438
where they burn
this huge wooden man.

02:20.540 --> 02:22.565
It's all about life, love
and the power of community.

02:22.675 --> 02:24.575
No, it's all about
a bunch of naked morons...

02:24.677 --> 02:26.736
drinking and doing
lots of drugs.

02:26.846 --> 02:28.905
- What are we, 12?
- Wait. Before you decide-

02:29.015 --> 02:33.281
This is a microcosm
of the power that is Burning Man.

02:38.691 --> 02:42.149
Imagine this, but 70 feet tall.

02:42.262 --> 02:44.423
Ah, nothing like the great outdoors.

02:44.531 --> 02:46.431
Who's ready to do
some fishing?

02:46.533 --> 02:48.433
Yeah, yeah!
Let's go fish! Yeah.

02:48.535 --> 02:51.129
This is Cast Master One.
Bring in air support.

02:56.509 --> 02:58.739
Look, it's Ariel.

02:58.845 --> 03:02.611
- Hey, Jackson, you ever do it with a dead mermaid?
- Mermaid? No.

03:04.751 --> 03:07.845
Oh, my God.
Lindsay Coolidge.

03:07.954 --> 03:10.081
Could she be any sexier?

03:14.627 --> 03:17.221
Gross! She'd never
do that, Toshi.

03:17.330 --> 03:19.457
Besides, where are we gonna get
a dozen Ping-Pong balls?

03:19.566 --> 03:21.466
Hey, Steve,
she's coming this way.

03:21.568 --> 03:23.661
Ask her out-
unless you're afraid.

03:23.770 --> 03:27.035
You forget yourself, Snot.
Steve Smith is never afraid.

03:28.474 --> 03:30.374
I'm Steve Smith.
Would you like to go out with me?

03:30.476 --> 03:32.376
- I'd love to.
- Really?

03:32.478 --> 03:34.571
On one condition. You gotta
find a date for my friend Jewel.

03:34.681 --> 03:36.615
- No problem.
- Here she comes now.

03:38.000 --> 03:44.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:45.925 --> 03:48.086
Hey, Jewel, Steve here is gonna
set you up on a date.

03:48.194 --> 03:50.788
Jewel, I'd like you
to meet my friends.

03:50.897 --> 03:54.128
Godzilla!

03:56.636 --> 03:59.605
I can't believe that Dummkopf
didn't remember your anniversary.

03:59.706 --> 04:01.765
And after what happened
last year-

04:01.874 --> 04:04.138
Oh, that was classic.

04:07.513 --> 04:10.038
That jerk forgot
our anniversary!

04:10.149 --> 04:12.049
- Keep her away from me!
- Aah!

04:12.151 --> 04:14.381
Okay, okay. I'm cool.

04:17.257 --> 04:19.156
Ach, ja.!
This is my favorite part.

04:19.259 --> 04:21.284
Here it comes, here it comes,
here it comes!

04:24.163 --> 04:26.563
He could never forget
a beating like that.

04:26.666 --> 04:29.726
I'm sure he's just waiting
for the perfect time to surprise me.

04:29.836 --> 04:33.101
After all, our anniversary
isn't over till midnight.

04:33.206 --> 04:35.106
This midnight fishing
is great.

04:35.208 --> 04:37.574
Sounds to me like someone
doesn't want to go home.

04:37.677 --> 04:39.577
Yeah, I'm, uh, laying low.

04:39.679 --> 04:41.579
Today is the anniversary
of a huge fight...

04:41.681 --> 04:43.581
me and Francine
got into last year.

04:43.683 --> 04:46.083
- Yeah? What about?
- Oh, I forgot our anniversary.

04:46.185 --> 04:49.416
I'm never gonna do that again.

04:49.522 --> 04:51.922
I- Uh-

04:53.026 --> 04:54.926
Ahh!

04:57.030 --> 04:59.123
There it is.

04:59.233 --> 05:02.433
Oh, good. You're up.

05:02.535 --> 05:04.935
I, uh, have a special
anniversary surprise for you.

05:05.038 --> 05:06.938
Your favorite song...

05:07.040 --> 05:09.201
sung by America's sweetheart,
Whitney Houston.

05:09.309 --> 05:11.402
Come on, daddy.
I- I need my fix.

05:11.511 --> 05:15.208
Remember the deal, Whitney. First you
sing, then you get your precious cocaine.

05:15.315 --> 05:17.215
How dare you!
Do you think I would-

05:24.824 --> 05:26.883
Happy anniversary,
sweetheart.

05:26.993 --> 05:28.893
Come on, Whitney.
Go get it.

05:30.730 --> 05:33.062
What a performer.
Well, let's turn in.

05:33.166 --> 05:35.532
You know what?
If you don't get why this day...

05:35.635 --> 05:38.399
is so important to me,
I guess you never will.

05:38.504 --> 05:40.404
Sweetie, I made a mistake.

05:40.506 --> 05:43.236
Can't you take a page from that bitch
Hillary Clinton and just let it go?

05:43.343 --> 05:46.904
No! This is the most inconsiderate thing
you've ever done.

05:47.013 --> 05:49.243
I am never
going to forget this.

05:49.349 --> 05:51.249
I was afraid
you were gonna say that-

05:51.351 --> 05:53.251
which is why
I got you this card.

05:53.353 --> 05:55.253
Open it. I promise it'll
make everything better.

05:55.355 --> 05:58.188
There's nothing that could- Oh.

06:01.060 --> 06:03.528
Thank God
for top-secret C.I.A. Technology.

06:03.629 --> 06:05.688
Just lose the last 20 hours
of her memory.

06:05.798 --> 06:08.858
- That ought to get me out of the doghouse.
- Francine?

06:08.968 --> 06:11.528
- Francine, can you hear me?
- Don't kick me out.

06:11.637 --> 06:14.936
The bouncer said I could, like,
totally meet Def Leppard.

06:15.041 --> 06:18.033
- Def Leppard?
- Francine, what year is it?

06:18.144 --> 06:20.977
Duh. 1985.
Hey, anybody got some gum?

06:21.080 --> 06:23.275
I wanna get the taste
of roadie out of my mouth.

06:25.385 --> 06:28.377
- Why the hell does my wife think it's 1985?
- Huh.

06:28.488 --> 06:30.388
Instead of erasing
the last 20 hours...

06:30.490 --> 06:33.050
I must have erased
the last 20 years.

06:33.159 --> 06:35.923
Oh, I guess this
is the dial for hours...

06:36.028 --> 06:39.555
and this is the dial for years.
Yeah. Yeah.

06:44.237 --> 06:47.070
The last 20 years of your wife's
memory have been erased.

06:47.173 --> 06:49.073
Well, go ahead
and undo it.

06:49.175 --> 06:51.575
Reverse brain erasing?
Now that's just science fiction.

06:51.677 --> 06:53.577
Kind of like
the female orgasm.

06:59.051 --> 07:01.611
Oh, that's great. You gotta
do stand-up. You gotta. You're great.

07:01.721 --> 07:03.689
You know, you're not
the first person who's told me that.

07:03.790 --> 07:05.690
I bet I'm not.
I bet I'm not.

07:05.792 --> 07:08.522
Anyway, Stan,
the procedure is irreversible.

07:08.628 --> 07:10.528
- You're kidding.
- Fraid not.

07:10.630 --> 07:13.360
But if you do figure
something out, let us know...

07:13.466 --> 07:15.366
and we'll name
the discovery after you-

07:15.468 --> 07:18.904
like they did forJohnny Flyswatter
or Doug Reach-Around.

07:21.507 --> 07:23.407
You permanently erased
Mom's memory?

07:23.509 --> 07:25.409
Well, that's just what the experts
at the lab say...

07:25.511 --> 07:27.445
but there's no way
she could ever forget me.

07:27.547 --> 07:29.777
I mean, who could forget this?
Or this?

07:29.882 --> 07:33.283
Or these?
Go on, kids, give 'em a squeeze.

07:33.386 --> 07:35.445
- It's not weird. I'm your dad.
- She's coming to.

07:35.555 --> 07:39.787
One look at me and her memories
of our love will come flooding back.

07:40.993 --> 07:42.893
Narc! Narc!

07:42.995 --> 07:44.895
What? What?
Oh, God, is there a bee on me?

07:44.997 --> 07:46.965
Oh! Does it look Africanized?

07:47.066 --> 07:48.727
Hey, baby.

07:48.835 --> 07:50.530
Mom.

07:50.636 --> 07:52.536
You idiot.
Why would you do that?

07:52.638 --> 07:54.538
I thought it was
like the hiccups.

07:57.176 --> 07:59.076
Okay, this is gonna be
harder than I thought.

07:59.178 --> 08:01.078
Maybe we should
watch the video.

08:02.415 --> 08:05.077
Has your loved one's memory
been irretrievably lost?

08:05.184 --> 08:07.516
Hi. I'm forgettable actor
Bill Pullman.

08:07.620 --> 08:09.520
You might not remember me
from such movies...

08:09.622 --> 08:11.647
as While You Were Sleeping
and Twister.

08:11.757 --> 08:14.954
Wait. Was I in Twister?
No. No, that was Bill Paxton.

08:15.061 --> 08:17.029
See? Memory can be
pretty tricky...

08:17.129 --> 08:19.188
so that's why if you tell your loved one
what's happened to them...

08:19.298 --> 08:21.198
their brain will implode.

08:21.300 --> 08:23.200
Good luck.
I'm Bill Pullman.

08:23.302 --> 08:25.270
Oh, oh!
I was also in Independence D-

08:25.371 --> 08:27.271
Jeff Daniels is right.

08:27.373 --> 08:29.807
We have to maintain the illusion
that your mother is still 18...

08:29.909 --> 08:32.275
or it's going to get
very messy in there.

08:32.378 --> 08:35.541
- So what do we do?
- Well, when she was 18,
she lived in West Langley...

08:35.648 --> 08:38.048
so we need to get her
back into her old apartment.

08:38.150 --> 08:40.345
Hayley, you can keep an eye on her
by being her roommate.

08:40.453 --> 08:43.820
What? I don't want to live with Mom.
Besides, I'm sure someone lives there.

08:45.958 --> 08:47.983
Good day, ma'am.
I'm a friend of your child.

08:48.094 --> 08:50.062
He or she has asked me
to take you...

08:50.162 --> 08:53.757
- to a wonderful retirement home.
- How lovely.

08:53.866 --> 08:57.199
- Right in here, ma'am.
- Oh, you're such a nice young-

08:59.505 --> 09:03.032
Hello? Am I supposed to vote now?

09:04.911 --> 09:07.004
Please, Pete?
Lindsay won't go out with me...

09:07.113 --> 09:09.172
unless I find a date
for her friend.

09:09.282 --> 09:12.342
She's not that bad-looking-
and besides, you're blind.

09:12.451 --> 09:14.851
Come on. You went
to the Winter Ball with that guy.

09:14.954 --> 09:16.854
Yes, it was a guy.

09:16.956 --> 09:19.015
Hello?

09:19.125 --> 09:22.720
It's like there's not a human being alive
that would go out with that girl.

09:22.828 --> 09:25.490
Hello.

09:27.266 --> 09:29.393
Who are you?

09:29.502 --> 09:32.027
Uh, Hayley,
your new roommate.

09:32.138 --> 09:37.235
- Oh, right. I must have blacked out.
- Wait a second. You party?

09:37.343 --> 09:40.779
Totally.
I need a shower.

09:40.880 --> 09:44.372
- Great Grizzly Adams. Who fired the gardener?

09:44.483 --> 09:48.351
Unbelievable. How did she
ever hook up with a stiff like Dad?

09:48.454 --> 09:50.388
I'll tell you how
she hooked up with a stiff like me.

09:50.489 --> 09:52.514
It was 20 years ago.

09:52.625 --> 09:56.322
I didn't normally pick up transients,
but for her I made an exception.

09:56.429 --> 09:58.363
Her T-shirt said "Bad Girl"...

09:58.464 --> 10:01.092
and her eyes said, "Read the T-shirt."

10:01.200 --> 10:05.569
My God, she was beautiful.
She was cold to me, but I was hot for her-

10:05.671 --> 10:08.105
which explained the moderate
temperature in the car.

10:08.207 --> 10:10.266
And then, fate scampered
across the road.

10:13.045 --> 10:15.741
It was on a slow train to Death City...

10:15.848 --> 10:18.908
so I asked the conductor ifhe could skip
the next few stops to make up-

10:19.018 --> 10:22.112
Oh, I shot it in the eye.

10:22.221 --> 10:25.054
She said it was the most compassionate act
she'd ever witnessed-

10:25.157 --> 10:27.057
and I got to kill something.

10:27.159 --> 10:29.059
It was a magical moment.

10:29.161 --> 10:32.653
Well, there you go. If you want
Francine back, just recreate that moment.

10:32.765 --> 10:35.757
Roger, you're a genius!
That's how I'll bring back her memory.

10:35.868 --> 10:39.804
You just gave me
my reach-around.

10:41.240 --> 10:43.868
Hey, old lady, party!

10:45.311 --> 10:48.109
Wow.

10:48.214 --> 10:50.478
This is Upstanding Conservative
to Dirty Liberal.

10:50.583 --> 10:52.813
Drop point ahead.

10:52.918 --> 10:55.580
Can you check the back tire?
The car is riding kind of low.

10:56.689 --> 10:59.783
What the hell?
You crazy bitch!

10:59.892 --> 11:02.224
I love you!
You got me.

11:02.328 --> 11:04.626
Game on.

11:07.066 --> 11:09.728
- Need a ride?
- Thanks, pops.

11:09.835 --> 11:13.134
Hey, are you, like, a narc? I feel like
I've seen you somewhere before.

11:13.239 --> 11:15.173
- Nope, first time we've met, Francine.
- What?

11:15.274 --> 11:17.174
- Nothing. Stick of your favorite gum?
- What?

11:17.276 --> 11:18.573
Nothing.

11:20.846 --> 11:23.906
Look out!

11:24.016 --> 11:26.576
Oh, sweet masked bandit of nature...

11:26.686 --> 11:28.586
let me put you out of your misery.

11:28.688 --> 11:31.748
Actually, I don't think you hit it.

11:31.857 --> 11:33.950
No, he's suffering- pure agony.

11:34.060 --> 11:35.960
Oh, my God! Stop!

11:36.062 --> 11:37.962
What, are you crazy?

11:38.064 --> 11:40.692
Crazy with compassion.
Come on. Watch me blow its head off.

11:44.737 --> 11:47.262
Die! Die!
So that you may know peace.

11:57.116 --> 11:59.846
- Truck!

12:04.390 --> 12:06.449
Stop the car,
you psychopath!

12:22.842 --> 12:24.742
Oh, God!

12:29.281 --> 12:30.646
Raccoon!

12:33.619 --> 12:35.519
No, I'm never coming home.

12:35.621 --> 12:37.555
Because you're
smothering me, Linda.

12:42.027 --> 12:45.258
I was wrong.
I'll be home by 9:00.

12:45.364 --> 12:49.323
Because I promised Derek
I'd meet him for a drink. That's why 9:00!

12:58.344 --> 13:00.972
And let the love
come flowing back.

13:04.049 --> 13:06.074
Stay away from me!

13:20.065 --> 13:21.396
This is great.

13:21.500 --> 13:24.560
By the way, great call
on this Rasta disguise, Steve.

13:24.670 --> 13:26.797
I'm "ganja" wear it
all the time.

13:28.908 --> 13:30.808
Hey, Steve,
is this your friend?

13:30.910 --> 13:32.810
Yeah. Lindsay,
this is Roger.

13:32.912 --> 13:34.812
- Nice to meet you.
- Charmed.

13:34.914 --> 13:37.974
- And this is Jewel.
- Your date.

13:38.083 --> 13:40.210
Oh, God. Oh, God.
I'm out. I'm out. Ew! Ew!

13:40.319 --> 13:42.219
Hey, we had a deal.

13:42.321 --> 13:46.257
Steve, she's so ugly.

13:46.358 --> 13:49.589
So ugly.

13:49.695 --> 13:52.095
Too bad. I snuck you out
so you could be my wingman.

13:52.198 --> 13:54.098
Now you can make nice
with Jewel...

13:54.200 --> 13:57.101
- or you can go home and rot in the attic.
- Uh, Steve...

13:57.203 --> 13:59.933
"Jamaican" me crazy.

14:00.039 --> 14:03.975
Sorry. I've had that one loaded up all night.

14:04.076 --> 14:06.374
Ahh. This picture
was taken on our honeymoon.

14:06.478 --> 14:10.278
It's the only photo of Francine
where you can't see Vaj.

14:10.382 --> 14:14.512
Ah, Vaj- the little island boy
who served as our tour guide.

14:14.620 --> 14:18.716
I see from her wristband that you were
at a Sandals all-inclusive resort.

14:19.224 --> 14:20.792
Hmm! Fancy.

14:20.893 --> 14:22.793
Wait a minute.

14:22.895 --> 14:25.022
I know just the thing
to trigger her memory.

14:36.308 --> 14:41.177
Hayley, I thought we were going to-
Burning Man

14:41.280 --> 14:43.748
Sorry, but my mom decided
to throw a rager.

14:43.849 --> 14:46.374
Besides, Jeff,
I never said I was going.

14:47.720 --> 14:50.883
Party foul! Consume!

14:53.125 --> 14:56.094
I had this boyfriend.
He was in an avalanche.

14:56.195 --> 14:58.595
He survived three days
on melted snow...

14:58.697 --> 15:00.597
and his grandfather
found him...

15:00.699 --> 15:04.533
because he had a dream about
the exact spot where he was trapped.

15:04.637 --> 15:07.868
Wow!
You had a boyfriend?

15:07.973 --> 15:11.204
Oh, you have-
You have a little thing.

15:11.310 --> 15:13.210
Oh, Roger, stop it.

15:13.312 --> 15:16.873
- I don't have a hard time looking at you.
- At me?

15:16.982 --> 15:19.041
I can see past
your hydrocephalic head...

15:19.151 --> 15:21.210
and into your beautiful mind.

15:21.320 --> 15:23.379
You're like Russell Crowe,
and I'm Jennifer Connelly.

15:23.489 --> 15:26.856
Yeah. Yeah, you're
Jennifer Connelly.

15:27.927 --> 15:30.589
Uncomfortable.

15:30.696 --> 15:32.596
Get a room, you two.

15:32.698 --> 15:34.598
Maybe we should lead
by example.

15:34.700 --> 15:37.066
Or we could just go back
to your place and make out.

15:37.169 --> 15:39.569
Yeah, okay, I understand.

15:39.672 --> 15:43.039
Well, I had a fun time anyway.
See you at school.

15:46.077 --> 15:46.908
Huh?

15:47.512 --> 15:48.411
Okay!

15:51.216 --> 15:54.151
- Hayley, where's your mother?
- Last time I saw her she was in the kitchen...

15:54.253 --> 15:56.517
- serving up body shots.
- What a hostess.

15:56.622 --> 16:00.114
- She's not here.
- There's a note in frosting on the fridge.

16:00.225 --> 16:02.523
"Hayley- Me and Jeff
went to Burning Man together.

16:02.628 --> 16:04.528
Rock on, Francine."

16:04.630 --> 16:06.860
My mother stole
my boyfriend!

16:06.966 --> 16:08.866
Your boyfriend
stole my wife!

16:08.968 --> 16:10.868
Let's get back at them
by dating each other.

16:10.970 --> 16:14.303
Wait a minute.
Daddy didn't think that through.

16:17.376 --> 16:20.311
The sandman's starting to goose me.

16:20.412 --> 16:22.539
Here. Have some coffee.

16:22.648 --> 16:24.775
- Klaus!
- When you come home und pack...

16:24.883 --> 16:27.374
I heard you and Hayley
talking about this Burning Man...

16:27.486 --> 16:29.920
so I says to mein self,
"Road trip!"

16:30.022 --> 16:32.889
Stan, by the way,
I could not hold mein pee-pee.

16:36.562 --> 16:38.894
Honestly, I only went out with you
to getJewel a date...

16:38.998 --> 16:41.967
- but you're a lot less of a dork than I thought.
- Stick around.

16:42.067 --> 16:45.059
I think you'll find
I'm a lot less of everything.

16:45.170 --> 16:48.230
You can do
whatever you want to me.

16:48.340 --> 16:52.242
Oh, so I can crate you and hide you
in that warehouse at the end of Raiders?

16:52.344 --> 16:55.905
So funny.
Kiss me, funny boy.

16:57.415 --> 16:59.280
I know, I know. Bad for the ozone.

17:01.854 --> 17:04.846
Yeah, Burning Man
is great this year.

17:04.957 --> 17:08.358
Ow! Ow!

17:08.460 --> 17:10.359
Dad, we've been searching all night.

17:10.462 --> 17:12.362
Let's just start fresh
in the morning.

17:12.464 --> 17:14.364
Francine? Francine?

17:14.465 --> 17:16.366
I'm not just saying this
to be clever-

17:16.468 --> 17:18.628
I really feel like a fish
out of water here.

17:21.607 --> 17:23.199
What's the deal
with the flower?

17:23.308 --> 17:26.367
On our wedding day, I placed this yellow
flower in your mom's white bouquet.

17:26.478 --> 17:30.209
It symbolized her sunshine brightening
my otherwise cloudy world.

17:30.315 --> 17:33.375
Dad, I've never seen this side of you.
It's so sweet.

17:33.485 --> 17:35.715
Well, if you tell anybody
I'll kill you.

17:37.823 --> 17:39.723
Ah. I'm serious.
I will kill you.

17:39.825 --> 17:41.850
I will reach into your chest,
pull out your beating heart...

17:41.960 --> 17:44.224
and eat it-
all of it, every last bit.

17:44.329 --> 17:46.854
Well, sweet dreams, angel.

17:46.965 --> 17:48.865
l-It's not you.
It's the timing, you know?

17:48.967 --> 17:50.832
I just got out
of a bad relationship.

17:50.936 --> 17:53.564
You're lying.
I'm a loser.

17:53.672 --> 17:56.072
Don't be like that.
You're not a loser.

17:56.175 --> 17:58.735
Think how pretty
you make people look by contrast.

17:58.844 --> 18:00.744
That's a gift.

18:00.846 --> 18:03.041
Gotcha!

18:04.950 --> 18:06.884
Oh, my God!
You're an alien!

18:06.985 --> 18:09.545
Oh, my God.!
Lindsay.! Lindsay.!

18:09.655 --> 18:12.055
- Roger is an ali-

18:12.157 --> 18:14.182
- Roger!
- She was all over me, and my wig fell off...

18:14.293 --> 18:16.523
- and we'd be in big trouble.

18:17.863 --> 18:19.854
Did you see
where they went?

18:19.965 --> 18:22.695
- Who?
- The black guys who did this.

18:26.971 --> 18:28.667
Aah! Mr. Smith!

18:29.574 --> 18:31.208
- Where's my wife?
- She ditched me as soon as we got here.

18:31.310 --> 18:33.870
I just ran away with her
to get a rise out of Hayley.

18:33.979 --> 18:36.379
- Please don't kill me!
- Let me get this straight.

18:36.482 --> 18:39.883
You ran away with my memory-erased mother
to a pagan festival...

18:39.985 --> 18:42.385
- just to get my attention?
- Did it work?

18:42.488 --> 18:45.252
Did it ever!
Mmm!

18:47.526 --> 18:51.053
You know, we're about to go on tour
to Bangkok and Amsterdam...

18:51.163 --> 18:53.222
and this hot piece
of mama's comin' with us.

18:53.332 --> 18:57.063
I am ripped off my ass!

18:59.671 --> 19:00.968
Francine!

19:01.073 --> 19:03.132
- You again?
- Look what I have.

19:03.242 --> 19:05.472
Remember. Please remember.

19:07.412 --> 19:09.312
How long till it kicks in?

19:09.414 --> 19:12.042
Oh, Francine, for God's sake,
we're married. You love me.

19:12.151 --> 19:16.588
Look, you're a stiff. I could never
fall in love with a suit like you.

19:16.688 --> 19:19.953
A suit like me?
Well then, I'll get rid of the suit.

19:21.860 --> 19:24.192
Huh? Huh? Look at me.
Nothing stiff here.

19:24.296 --> 19:28.164
Hey, it's never gonna
happen with us. Never!

19:31.103 --> 19:34.368
Because hang-gliding
makes me feel alive, Linda, okay?

19:41.446 --> 19:43.004
Francine!

19:52.691 --> 19:54.382
Don't worry. I'm leaving.

19:54.493 --> 19:57.223
I just wanted you to be safe.

19:57.329 --> 20:01.060
You're the best thing that ever
happened to me, and I took it for granted.

20:01.166 --> 20:03.225
I'm just happy that-

20:03.335 --> 20:06.896
Uh, that I got the privilege
to be with you for the time that I did.

20:09.007 --> 20:11.237
Okay, my shoes are full.
I better go now.

20:11.343 --> 20:16.337
I love you, Francine.
It's a little late, but happy anniversary.

20:20.652 --> 20:22.847
Remember.

20:25.757 --> 20:28.157
- Stan?
- Francine?

20:28.260 --> 20:33.254
Stan, it was so weird.
And I was alone and confused.

20:33.365 --> 20:36.926
And there was this raccoon,
and I knew who I was again.

20:37.035 --> 20:38.935
Oh, Francine, thank God.

20:39.037 --> 20:42.529
- I love you.
- I love you too, Stan.

20:45.043 --> 20:47.409
That was gross.
I still love you.

20:49.514 --> 20:52.506
Thanks for looking after me.
I'm so embarrassed.

20:52.618 --> 20:56.019
Don't be. You were fun.
In fact, you were cool.

20:57.189 --> 21:00.158
Oh. Hey, funny story.

21:01.526 --> 21:02.925
A little bit longer...

21:03.028 --> 21:05.053
and their last 24 hours
will be completely forgotten.

21:05.163 --> 21:07.222
- Oh, thank God.
- You are not off the hook, mister.

21:07.332 --> 21:09.232
I am deeply disappointed in you.

21:09.334 --> 21:12.770
- Dad, I was with this one.
- Oh. Well, outstanding.

21:46.738 --> 21:48.569
Bye! Have a beautiful time.
