WEBVTT

00:58.224 --> 00:59.975
No, no, we're done. We're done, man.

01:49.400 --> 01:51.777
Aunt Silv, stop yelling.

01:51.945 --> 01:54.571
All I'm saying is,
if you had told me vegetarian lasagna...

01:54.739 --> 01:57.366
...I would've made vegetarian lasagna.

01:59.077 --> 02:00.911
Well, the meat's only every third layer.

02:01.079 --> 02:03.080
Maybe you could scrape.

02:03.581 --> 02:05.916
Ross, did you really read
all these baby books?

02:06.084 --> 02:09.586
Yep. You could plunk me down in
the middle of any woman's uterus...

02:09.753 --> 02:11.713
...no compass...

02:11.881 --> 02:13.882
...and I could find my way out like that.

02:15.343 --> 02:16.593
Ooh, this is cool.

02:16.761 --> 02:20.222
It says in some parts of the world
people actually eat the placenta.

02:22.809 --> 02:24.977
And we're done with the yogurt.

02:26.688 --> 02:27.729
Sorry.

02:28.439 --> 02:31.984
Aunt Silv, I did this as a favor.
I am not a caterer.

02:32.152 --> 02:35.279
What do you want me to do
with a dozen lasagnas?

02:36.197 --> 02:38.574
Nice talk, Aunt Silv.

02:39.033 --> 02:40.868
You kiss Uncle Freddie with that mouth?

02:42.620 --> 02:44.121
Hey, Ross, listen.

02:44.289 --> 02:47.332
Do you know that right now
your baby is only this big?

02:47.500 --> 02:48.959
- This is your baby.
- Heh.

02:49.127 --> 02:50.502
Hi, Daddy.

02:50.670 --> 02:51.962
Hello.

02:52.130 --> 02:53.714
How come you don't live with Mommy?

02:56.342 --> 02:58.343
How come Mommy lives
with that other lady?

03:04.058 --> 03:06.185
What's a lesbian?

03:11.774 --> 03:14.568
Honey, you can say it.
It's Poconos. Poconos.

03:14.736 --> 03:18.197
It's like "poke a nose."

03:18.364 --> 03:19.823
Ah.

03:19.991 --> 03:23.160
Poke a nose.

03:24.579 --> 03:27.414
Blah, blah, blah.

03:31.294 --> 03:34.254
- So did I hear "Poconos"?
- Yes.

03:34.422 --> 03:36.673
My sister's giving us her place
for the weekend.

03:36.841 --> 03:39.343
Woo-hoo. First weekend away together.

03:39.510 --> 03:42.012
- Yeah, it's a big step.
- I know.

03:42.889 --> 03:44.431
It's just a weekend. Big deal.

03:44.599 --> 03:47.434
Wasn't this supposed to be just a fling,
huh?

03:47.602 --> 03:49.519
Shouldn't it be...

03:49.687 --> 03:51.396
...flung by now?

03:52.148 --> 03:54.274
I mean, we are way past the "fling" thing.

03:54.442 --> 03:56.235
I'm feeling things
I've only read about...

03:56.402 --> 03:58.237
...in Danielle Steel books, you know?

03:58.404 --> 04:01.448
I mean, when I'm with him,
I'm just totally, totally...

04:01.616 --> 04:04.368
Nauseous. I'm physically nauseous.

04:05.453 --> 04:08.664
What am I supposed to do, huh?
Call lmmigration?

04:09.832 --> 04:11.625
I could call lmmigration.

04:18.132 --> 04:21.718
I love babies
with their little baby shoes...

04:21.886 --> 04:26.014
...and their little baby toes
and their little hands...

04:26.182 --> 04:28.308
Okay, you're gonna have to stop that...

04:28.476 --> 04:29.685
...forever.

04:39.779 --> 04:41.613
Need a new table.

04:41.990 --> 04:43.448
You think?

04:50.540 --> 04:52.958
- Hey, hey, hey. Come on in.
- Hey. Hello.

04:53.126 --> 04:54.710
I brought the books...

04:54.877 --> 04:57.254
...and Monica sends her love
along with this lasagna.

04:57.422 --> 04:59.006
Oh, great.

04:59.549 --> 05:02.509
Is it vegetarian?
Because Susan doesn't eat meat.

05:04.679 --> 05:07.347
I'm pretty sure that it is. Yeah.

05:08.891 --> 05:11.810
So I got the results of the amnio today.

05:11.978 --> 05:13.312
Oh, tell me. Is everything?

05:13.479 --> 05:14.938
Totally and completely healthy.

05:15.106 --> 05:17.691
- Oh, that's great. That is great.
- Ha, ha.

05:19.027 --> 05:20.319
Ah.

05:21.571 --> 05:25.365
Hey. When did you and Susan
meet Huey Lewis?

05:25.533 --> 05:27.993
Uh, that's our friend Tanya.

05:37.628 --> 05:39.963
Of course it's your friend Tanya.

05:42.300 --> 05:43.717
Don't you wanna know about the sex?

05:44.552 --> 05:46.094
The sex?

05:47.263 --> 05:51.683
Yeah, I'm having enough trouble with
the image of you and Susan together.

05:51.851 --> 05:53.477
But when you throw in Tanya...

05:57.023 --> 05:59.441
The sex of the baby, Ross.

06:00.902 --> 06:02.778
Oh. You know the sex of the baby?

06:02.945 --> 06:04.488
- Uh-huh.
- Oh, oh, oh!

06:05.156 --> 06:06.990
- Do you want to know?
- No, no, no.

06:07.158 --> 06:09.368
No, I don't want to know.
Absolutely not.

06:09.535 --> 06:12.287
No, I think you shouldn't know until
you look down there...

06:12.455 --> 06:14.498
...and see, "Oh, there it is."

06:15.208 --> 06:16.750
Or isn't.

06:18.294 --> 06:21.797
- Oh. Hello, Ross.
- Susan.

06:21.964 --> 06:23.507
So?

06:23.674 --> 06:25.008
So did you hear?

06:25.176 --> 06:27.302
Yes, we did. Everything's A-okay.

06:27.470 --> 06:30.305
Oh, that's so cool.

06:31.432 --> 06:32.933
It really is. Ha, ha.

06:33.101 --> 06:34.309
Do we know?

06:34.477 --> 06:37.229
- We certainly do. It's going to be a...
- Hey, hey!

06:37.397 --> 06:38.939
Ho, ho! Hello?

06:39.107 --> 06:41.691
See, a guy who doesn't wanna know
standing right here.

06:41.984 --> 06:46.822
Oh. Ha, ha. Uh, well, is it what
we thought it would be?

06:47.323 --> 06:49.241
- Mm-hm.
- Aah!

06:53.538 --> 06:55.080
What?

06:55.248 --> 06:58.417
Okay, what did we think it' was gonna be?
No, no, no.

06:58.584 --> 07:00.794
I don't want to know.
Don't want to know. Okay.

07:00.962 --> 07:02.921
You know, I should probably just go.

07:03.464 --> 07:06.591
- Well, thanks for the books.
- No problem. Okay.

07:10.138 --> 07:11.304
Susan.

07:16.727 --> 07:21.064
All right, who should we call first?
Your folks or Deb and Rhona?

07:24.986 --> 07:26.027
Hello?

07:26.195 --> 07:27.612
Uh...

07:28.364 --> 07:30.782
Never mind. I don't wanna know.

07:31.909 --> 07:35.036
Okay, so just because it was my table,
I have to buy a new one?

07:35.204 --> 07:36.955
That's the rule.

07:37.999 --> 07:39.833
What rule? There's no rule.

07:40.001 --> 07:41.543
If anything, you owe me a table.

07:41.961 --> 07:45.088
- How did you get there?
- I believe this piece of furniture was fine...

07:45.256 --> 07:47.966
...until your little breakfast adventure
with Angela Delveccio.

07:48.843 --> 07:49.926
You knew about that?

07:50.094 --> 07:51.761
The impressions you made
in the butter...

07:51.929 --> 07:53.680
...left little to the imagination.

07:55.308 --> 07:57.100
Okay, okay. How about if we split it?

07:58.186 --> 08:00.187
What do you mean, like, buy it together?

08:00.521 --> 08:01.605
Yeah.

08:01.772 --> 08:03.982
Do you think we're ready
for something like that?

08:05.151 --> 08:07.110
- Why not?
- Well, it's just a big commitment.

08:07.278 --> 08:09.821
I mean, what if one of us
wants to move out?

08:10.114 --> 08:12.157
- Why, are you moving out?
- I'm not moving out.

08:12.325 --> 08:14.409
You'd tell me if you were moving out,
right?

08:14.577 --> 08:19.372
- Yes, it's just that, with my last roommate...
- Oh, I know all about Kip.

08:19.540 --> 08:22.417
We bought a hibachi together,
and then he ran off and got married...

08:22.585 --> 08:23.877
...and things got pretty ugly.

08:24.921 --> 08:27.005
So let me ask you something.

08:27.215 --> 08:28.798
Was Kip a better roommate than me?

08:29.800 --> 08:31.551
Oh, don't do that.

08:37.850 --> 08:39.808
You've got a couple changes
in your schedule.

08:39.977 --> 08:43.395
Your 4:00 herbal massage
has been pushed back to 4:30.

08:43.563 --> 08:46.566
And Ms. Summerfield
canceled her 5:30 shiatsu.

08:46.734 --> 08:48.026
Okay. Thanks.

08:48.194 --> 08:50.237
Oh. Here comes your 3:00.

08:50.404 --> 08:53.240
I don't mean to sound
unprofessional, but, yum.

08:57.745 --> 09:01.331
Oh. Paolo. Hi.
What are you doing here?

09:02.124 --> 09:07.379
Uh, Rachella tell me you...

09:07.547 --> 09:08.880
...massage?

09:09.048 --> 09:11.716
Yeah, well, Rachella's right. Yeah.

09:15.888 --> 09:16.972
Oh.

09:17.139 --> 09:19.766
Okay, I don't know what you just said,
so let's just start.

09:20.726 --> 09:24.271
Uh, I am, uh...

09:24.438 --> 09:26.523
...being naked?

09:26.691 --> 09:28.108
Um, that's really your decision.

09:28.609 --> 09:31.236
I mean, some people prefer,
you know, to take off...

09:31.404 --> 09:34.364
Ooh, oops! Being naked.

09:35.283 --> 09:38.618
I can't believe you don't want to know.
I mean, I could not know.

09:38.786 --> 09:42.372
I mean, if the doctor knows,
and Carol knows, and Susan knows...

09:42.540 --> 09:44.416
And Monica knows.

09:44.709 --> 09:47.002
Heh. How could you?
I don't even know.

09:47.169 --> 09:51.131
Carol called to thank me for the lasagna.
I asked. She told me.

09:51.299 --> 09:52.757
So, what's it going to be?

09:52.925 --> 09:54.301
Whoa.

09:54.969 --> 09:57.804
Huh? Oh, great.
Now he knows and I don't know.

09:57.972 --> 10:00.473
I'm sorry. I'm just excited
about being an aunt.

10:00.641 --> 10:02.392
Or an uncle.

10:07.398 --> 10:09.566
Hey, Phoebe. Hey, Pheebs.

10:09.734 --> 10:11.234
Fine.

10:13.988 --> 10:16.072
- Phoebe, what's the matter?
- Nothing. I'm sorry.

10:16.240 --> 10:18.074
I'm just... I'm out of sorts.

10:18.242 --> 10:20.410
Hey, can we get
some cappuccino over here?

10:22.038 --> 10:23.872
Oh, right. That's me.

10:25.249 --> 10:28.418
Hey, Chandler.
That table place closes at 7. Come on.

10:28.586 --> 10:29.753
Fine.

10:30.212 --> 10:33.131
Phoebe. What is it?

10:34.383 --> 10:38.053
- You know Paolo?
- I'm familiar with his work, yes.

10:39.263 --> 10:40.513
Look, he made a move on me.

10:40.681 --> 10:43.767
- Whoa. The store will be open tomorrow.
- More coffee over here, please.

10:50.691 --> 10:52.275
Well, what happened?

10:52.443 --> 10:54.319
Well, he came in for a massage...

10:54.487 --> 10:56.446
...and everything was fine until...

11:01.202 --> 11:02.494
- My God.
- Are you sure?

11:04.205 --> 11:05.413
Oh, yeah. I'm sure.

11:10.294 --> 11:14.005
And all of a sudden, his hands
weren't the problem anymore.

11:18.386 --> 11:19.427
Was it?

11:19.595 --> 11:22.097
Oh, Boy Scouts
could've camped under there.

11:22.598 --> 11:23.765
Ooh.

11:24.225 --> 11:26.768
- "Ooh," what?
- Ma Thurman.

11:26.936 --> 11:28.103
- Oh.
- The actress.

11:28.270 --> 11:30.063
Uma Thurman!

11:31.023 --> 11:32.732
Thanks, Rach.

11:34.652 --> 11:36.611
- What are you gonna you do?
- You have to tell her.

11:36.779 --> 11:39.531
You have to tell her.
It's your moral obligation as a friend...

11:39.699 --> 11:43.076
...as a woman. I think it's a feminist issue.
Guys? Guys?

11:43.244 --> 11:45.120
Oh, yeah, you have to tell her.

11:45.287 --> 11:46.788
Feminist issue? That's where I went.

11:48.833 --> 11:50.083
She is gonna hate me.

11:50.251 --> 11:51.710
Yeah, well.

11:59.301 --> 12:01.428
Will you pick one? Just pick one.

12:01.595 --> 12:02.929
Here, how about that one?

12:03.681 --> 12:05.682
That's patio furniture.

12:06.142 --> 12:10.645
So what? Like people are gonna come in
and think, "Uh-oh, I'm outside again."

12:10.813 --> 12:12.105
Fine.

12:12.523 --> 12:14.232
What about the birds?

12:15.651 --> 12:17.360
I don't know. Birds just don't say:

12:17.528 --> 12:20.196
"Hello, sit here. Eat something."

12:21.282 --> 12:22.782
You pick one.

12:22.950 --> 12:24.325
How about the ladybugs?

12:24.493 --> 12:28.705
Oh, so forget about the birds,
but big red insects suggest fine dining?

12:29.290 --> 12:31.207
Fine. Do you want the birds?
Get the birds.

12:31.375 --> 12:33.251
Not like that, I won't.

12:36.547 --> 12:37.839
Kip would've liked the birds.

12:48.559 --> 12:50.518
- Hey.
- Hi, Pheebs.

12:50.936 --> 12:51.978
Are you moving out?

12:52.146 --> 12:54.189
No, these aren't all of my suitcases.

12:54.356 --> 12:56.107
This one's Paolo's.

12:56.275 --> 12:57.734
Um...

12:58.360 --> 13:01.571
Um, Rachel, can we talk for a sec?

13:02.281 --> 13:04.365
Well, sure. Just for a sec, though...

13:04.533 --> 13:06.785
...because Paolo's on his way over.
- Oh.

13:07.828 --> 13:09.954
Okay. Um...

13:10.664 --> 13:11.956
Okay.

13:12.124 --> 13:13.416
Um...

13:14.502 --> 13:15.585
- Oh, Pheebs...
- Um, okay.

13:16.420 --> 13:21.174
Um, ahem. We haven't known each other
for that long a time.

13:21.342 --> 13:24.177
And, um, there are three things
that you should know about me.

13:24.720 --> 13:27.764
One, my friends are the most
important thing in my life.

13:29.183 --> 13:31.351
Two, I never lie.

13:31.811 --> 13:35.480
And three, I make the best
oatmeal-raisin cookies in the world.

13:38.359 --> 13:41.110
Okay. Thanks, Pheebs.

13:45.950 --> 13:47.992
Mm, my God.

13:49.203 --> 13:51.329
Why have I never tasted these before?

13:51.497 --> 13:52.789
Oh, I don't make them a lot...

13:52.957 --> 13:55.416
...because I don't think it's fair
to the other cookies.

13:59.421 --> 14:00.922
Ahem, God.

14:01.090 --> 14:05.635
Well, you're right. These are the best
oatmeal-raisin cookies I've ever had.

14:05.803 --> 14:09.556
- Which proves that I never lie.
- I guess you don't.

14:09.974 --> 14:11.307
Paolo made a pass at me.

14:14.645 --> 14:16.354
So, what do you think?

14:16.522 --> 14:18.773
I think it's the most beautiful table
I've ever seen.

14:18.941 --> 14:20.400
I know.

14:20.568 --> 14:23.611
So how does this work? Gonna balance
the plates on these little heads?

14:23.779 --> 14:26.197
Who cares? We'll eat at the sink.
Come on.

14:28.617 --> 14:29.617
Heads up, Ross.

14:30.244 --> 14:32.662
Score! You suck.

14:35.749 --> 14:37.500
Are you okay?

14:40.254 --> 14:41.462
I need some milk.

14:43.924 --> 14:45.633
I've got milk.

14:50.848 --> 14:52.056
Here you go.

15:00.232 --> 15:01.733
Better?

15:03.402 --> 15:04.861
No.

15:07.072 --> 15:09.782
Ugh! I feel so stupid.

15:10.117 --> 15:12.201
I think about the other day,
with you guys, you know.

15:12.369 --> 15:16.164
And I was all,
"Oh, Paolo. He's so great.

15:16.332 --> 15:18.625
He makes me feel so..." Ugh!

15:18.792 --> 15:20.376
God.

15:20.544 --> 15:24.255
I'm so embarrassed.

15:24.423 --> 15:25.840
I'm the one he hit on.

15:26.008 --> 15:28.134
I unleashed him on you.
If I'd never met him...

15:28.302 --> 15:29.719
...this would've never happened.

15:29.887 --> 15:32.013
- I'm so sorry.
- No, I'm sorry.

15:32.181 --> 15:33.431
No, I'm sorry.

15:33.599 --> 15:34.974
Oh, wait. Oh.

15:35.142 --> 15:37.393
- What are we sorry about?
- I don't know.

15:37.561 --> 15:39.604
Right. He's the pig.

15:39.772 --> 15:42.482
- Such a pig.
- Oh, God, he's such a pig.

15:42.650 --> 15:46.235
- Oh, he's like a big disgusting pig...
- Yeah, like a...

15:46.403 --> 15:48.738
- Pig man.
- Yes, good. Okay.

15:53.035 --> 15:55.995
Oh, but he was my pig man.

15:57.331 --> 15:59.832
How did I not see this?

16:01.001 --> 16:02.794
Oh, I know!

16:05.381 --> 16:06.881
Because...

16:07.383 --> 16:08.925
...he's gorgeous.

16:09.093 --> 16:10.760
And he's charming.

16:10.928 --> 16:13.554
- And when he looks at you...
- Okay. Okay, Pheebs.

16:13.722 --> 16:15.223
The end.

16:16.809 --> 16:18.935
Ugh. God.

16:20.771 --> 16:22.939
Should I not have told you?

16:23.607 --> 16:26.943
No, trust me,
it's much better that I know.

16:30.155 --> 16:34.450
Uh, I just liked it better before.
It was better.

16:50.926 --> 16:52.176
I think she took it pretty well.

16:52.886 --> 16:54.887
You know, Paolo's over there
right now, so...

16:55.055 --> 16:57.348
Yeah, we should get over there
and see if she's okay.

16:57.516 --> 16:59.517
Just one second.

16:59.852 --> 17:02.603
- Whoo! Score.
- Game. Us.

17:02.771 --> 17:04.021
Yes.

17:05.482 --> 17:06.898
Come on, Pheebs.

17:07.067 --> 17:08.233
Whoo.

17:08.402 --> 17:11.279
Well, it looks like, uh,
we kicked your butts.

17:11.446 --> 17:12.696
No, no. She kicked our butts.

17:12.865 --> 17:15.491
You could be on the Olympic
"Standing There" team.

17:15.951 --> 17:17.160
Come on. Two on one.

17:17.411 --> 17:20.079
What are you still doing here?
She just broke up with the guy.

17:20.247 --> 17:21.580
It's time for you to swoop in.

17:23.083 --> 17:24.500
What? Now?

17:24.667 --> 17:26.294
Yes. Now is when you swoop.

17:26.462 --> 17:28.296
You gotta make sure
that when Paolo walks out...

17:28.464 --> 17:30.173
...the first guy Rachel sees is you.

17:30.340 --> 17:32.842
She's got to know
that you're everything he's not.

17:33.010 --> 17:34.969
You're like... Like the anti-Paolo.

17:36.930 --> 17:38.681
My Catholic friend is right.

17:39.308 --> 17:41.350
She's distraught. You're there for her.

17:41.518 --> 17:44.729
You pick up the pieces,
and then you usher in:

17:44.897 --> 17:47.273
The Age of Ross.

17:54.448 --> 17:55.448
See this? See?

18:00.370 --> 18:02.246
- How's it going?
- Don't stare.

18:02.414 --> 18:04.874
She just finished throwing
his clothes off the balcony.

18:05.042 --> 18:07.376
Now there's just a lot of gesturing
and arm-waving.

18:07.544 --> 18:11.214
Okay, that is either, "How could you?"
Or "Enormous breasts."

18:13.175 --> 18:14.675
Here he comes.

18:23.644 --> 18:27.313
Uh, I am, uh...

18:27.481 --> 18:28.773
...to say goodbye.

18:29.149 --> 18:30.983
Oh, okay, bye-bye.

18:34.154 --> 18:35.696
Paolo.

18:35.864 --> 18:39.283
I really hate you for what you did to Rachel.
But I still have five of these...

18:39.451 --> 18:42.453
...so heat it at 375
until the cheese bubbles.

18:47.417 --> 18:48.918
Paolo, I just wanna tell you...

18:49.086 --> 18:53.005
...and I think I'd speak
for everyone when I say...

18:58.762 --> 19:00.847
Oh. Just look at her.

19:01.014 --> 19:04.016
Oh, you guys, I really think only one of us
should go out there...

19:04.184 --> 19:06.060
...so she's not overwhelmed.
- Oh, right.

19:06.228 --> 19:08.938
And I really think it should be me.

19:22.035 --> 19:23.828
Hey.

19:25.581 --> 19:26.998
You all right?

19:27.457 --> 19:30.585
Oh. I've been better.

19:34.506 --> 19:35.631
Come here.

19:42.973 --> 19:44.265
Listen...

19:44.433 --> 19:46.893
...you deserve so much better than him.

19:47.060 --> 19:49.645
You know? I mean, you...

19:50.314 --> 19:53.983
You should be with a guy who knows
what he has when he has you.

19:55.861 --> 19:56.944
Ross...

19:57.988 --> 19:59.238
What?

19:59.990 --> 20:02.617
I'm so sick of guys.

20:03.327 --> 20:05.411
I don't want to look at another guy.

20:05.579 --> 20:07.914
I don't want to think about another guy.

20:08.081 --> 20:11.292
I don't even want to be near another guy.

20:14.588 --> 20:15.963
Huh.

20:18.759 --> 20:21.886
- Ross, you're so great.
- Oh, ha, ha.

20:32.314 --> 20:34.857
- Are you all right?
- Are you okay?

20:35.025 --> 20:36.692
Medium. Heh.

20:36.860 --> 20:39.362
- Any cookies left?
- Yeah.

20:41.323 --> 20:43.115
Heh. See, Rach, um...

20:43.283 --> 20:47.703
See, I don't think swearing off guys
altogether is the answer. I really don't.

20:47.871 --> 20:52.625
I think what you need is to develop a more
sophisticated screening process.

20:53.418 --> 20:56.796
No. No. I just need
to be by myself for a while.

20:56.964 --> 20:58.839
You know?
I just gotta figure out what I want.

20:59.007 --> 21:01.175
No, no.

21:01.510 --> 21:05.680
See, because not all guys out there
are gonna be a Paolo.

21:05.847 --> 21:07.723
No, I know. I know.

21:07.891 --> 21:11.686
And I'm sure your little boy's
not gonna grow up to be one.

21:13.063 --> 21:15.106
- What?
- What?

21:16.942 --> 21:19.068
I'm having a boy?

21:19.236 --> 21:20.861
Uh, no.

21:22.906 --> 21:25.866
No. In fact, you're not having a boy.

21:26.034 --> 21:28.119
I'm having a boy.

21:28.287 --> 21:30.746
Am I having a boy?

21:31.540 --> 21:33.791
- You're having a boy.
- Aah!

21:33.959 --> 21:36.502
- I'm having a boy. I'm having a boy.
- Yes!

21:36.670 --> 21:37.795
- What?
- What is it?

21:37.963 --> 21:40.339
I'm having a boy. I'm having a boy.

21:40.507 --> 21:41.966
Hey.

21:44.052 --> 21:45.970
We already knew that.

21:49.141 --> 21:50.891
I'm having a son.

21:53.603 --> 21:54.937
Um...

21:58.859 --> 22:01.652
Yes. And that would be a shutdown.

22:01.820 --> 22:03.112
Shutout!

22:06.491 --> 22:09.118
Where you guys going?
Come on, one more game.

22:09.286 --> 22:12.621
- Oh. It's 2:30 in the morning.
- Yeah. Get out.

22:12.998 --> 22:16.000
You guys are always hanging out
in my apartment.

22:16.168 --> 22:18.711
Come on, I'll only use my left hand,
huh?

22:18.879 --> 22:20.963
Come on, wussies.

22:24.760 --> 22:27.386
- All right. Okay. I gotta go.
- Mm-hm.

22:27.554 --> 22:28.971
I'm going.

22:29.139 --> 22:30.931
And I'm gone.

22:33.352 --> 22:35.186
- One more game?
- Oh, yeah.
