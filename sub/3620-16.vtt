00:11.567 --> 00:13.264
DON'T WORRY!
WE'LL FIGURE IT OUT.

00:13.438 --> 00:15.049
YOU'RE LIKE
HYPERVENTILATING.

00:15.223 --> 00:16.354
I'M NOT
HYPERVENTILATING.

ARE YOU KIDDING?

00:30.760 --> 00:33.023
IT'S EXACTLY WHAT LEO
WOULD WANT US TO DO.

00:33.197 --> 00:35.678
BESIDES, PAIGE DESERVES
WHAT LEO AND I HAD.

00:35.852 --> 00:37.114
AND YOU WILL
HAVE THAT AGAIN

00:37.288 --> 00:39.029
AS SOON AS WE FIGURE OUT
WHAT WE'RE UP AGAINST.

00:39.203 --> 00:41.118
WELL, UNTIL THEN,
SOMEONE IN THIS FAMILY

00:41.292 --> 00:43.991
IS GOING TO HAVE
A NORMAL, HAPPY

HOW'S THE CHRISTY

ACTUALLY,
IT'S GOING REALLY WELL.

THE ART OF WALKING
IN HIGH HEELS,

00:54.175 --> 00:56.046
AND NOW WE'RE JUST
PICKING OUT AN OUTFIT--

00:56.220 --> 00:57.918
TRY THAT ONE.

00:58.092 --> 01:00.355
AND WE'RE GONNA GO
FOR A LITTLE TEST RUN
AT A CAFE, YOU KNOW?

01:00.529 --> 01:01.796
SEE HOW IT GOES.

01:01.920 --> 01:04.838
GREAT. BECAUSE DEMONS
ATTACKING AT THE PARTY
I CAN HANDLE,

01:05.012 --> 01:07.536
BUT CHRISTY EATING
WITH HER HANDS,
I CANNOT HANDLE.

01:07.710 --> 01:10.321
DON'T WORRY.
SHE WILL BE TOTALLY,
TOTALLY READY

01:10.495 --> 01:11.757

TO SEND A MESSAGE.

01:25.510 --> 01:28.949
YES. THAT
IT'S SUICIDE TO GO UP
AGAINST THE TRIAD.

01:29.123 --> 01:31.821
WE CAN'T
AFFORD TO LOSE
ANY MORE DEMONS, XAR.

01:31.995 --> 01:33.649
WELL, THERE MIGHT BE
ANOTHER WAY.

RETREATING DEEPER
INTO THE UNDERWORLD?

01:36.652 --> 01:38.915
IF THE TRIAD GETS
THE ULTIMATE POWER,

01:39.089 --> 01:40.786
NOWHERE WILL BE SAFE.

01:40.961 --> 01:42.788
BUT WE CAN'T
EVEN GET THEM OUT
OF MAGIC SCHOOL NOW,

01:42.963 --> 01:44.616
LET ALONE
DESTROY THEM.

01:44.790 --> 01:46.227
WE'RE NOT STRONG ENOUGH
TO STOP THEM.

01:46.401 --> 01:47.793
NO.

01:47.968 --> 01:49.970
BUT THE CHARMED ONES
MIGHT BE.

01:50.144 --> 01:53.974
PERHAPS WE CAN
GET THEM TO DESTROY
THE TRIAD FOR US.

WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

03:01.926 --> 03:04.015
I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING
RING SHOPPING WITH HENRY.

03:04.109 --> 03:06.280
OH, YEAH.
I WAS SUPPOSED TO,

03:06.384 --> 03:07.576
BUT, YOU KNOW, I FIGURED
WHAT WITH THE KEY

03:07.680 --> 03:09.455
TO THE ULTIMATE POWER
OVER AT PHOEBE'S,

03:09.630 --> 03:11.327
I SHOULD TAKE
THIS TIME JUST TO,

03:11.501 --> 03:13.568
YOU KNOW, KIND OF
CHECK THINGS OUT AND...

03:13.692 --> 03:16.079
THIS IS YOUR WEDDING RING
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.

03:16.163 --> 03:18.301
I KNOW. I'M NOT GETTING
MARRIED TOMORROW.

03:18.415 --> 03:19.628
I'VE GOT SOME TIME.

03:19.700 --> 03:21.746
BUT STILL, WHEN A GIRL
ISN'T THE LEAST BIT GIDDY

03:21.920 --> 03:23.138
ABOUT RING SHOPPING,

03:23.313 --> 03:25.696
THAT USUALLY MEANS
SOMETHING'S VERY WRONG.

JUST NOT OF THOSE

03:30.014 --> 03:31.144
THAT GOES CRAZY
ABOUT THE WHOLE THING.

03:31.218 --> 03:32.257
DID YOU EVER
THINK OF THAT?

03:32.322 --> 03:34.588
I THINK YOU HAVE
A CLASSIC CASE
OF COLD FEET.

03:34.715 --> 03:37.022
I DON'T HAVE
COLD FEET BECAUSE...

03:37.196 --> 03:38.893
BECAUSE I'M CRAZY
FOR HENRY.

03:39.067 --> 03:41.591
I AM. CRAZY FOR HIM.

SURE, I BELIEVE YOU.

03:43.593 --> 03:44.790
AND I LOVE LEO, TOO,

03:44.874 --> 03:46.944
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN
I DIDN'T GET KNOTS
IN MY STOMACH

03:47.119 --> 03:48.685
THE MOMENT I SAID YES.

03:48.859 --> 03:50.383
YOU DID, REALLY?

03:50.557 --> 03:51.688
MM-HMM.

03:51.862 --> 03:53.473
IT'S PERFECTLY NORMAL.

03:53.647 --> 03:57.259
WELL, IS IT NORMAL
TO FIGHT ABOUT
EVERY LITTLE THING?

03:57.433 --> 03:58.695
ACTUALLY, YES.

03:58.869 --> 04:00.567
LOOK, YOU JUST NEED
TO RELAX

04:00.741 --> 04:02.917
AND SPEND A LITTLE
TIME TOGETHER
AND TALK IT OUT

04:03.091 --> 04:05.572
AND, YOU KNOW, LISTEN.
THAT'S ALWAYS A GOOD THING.

04:05.746 --> 04:08.183
I COULD PROBABLY
DO SOME MORE LISTENING

04:08.357 --> 04:09.358
THAN I'VE BEEN DOING.

04:09.532 --> 04:11.491
YOU SHOULD KIND OF
GIVE IT A TRY.

04:11.665 --> 04:13.145
OK, I WILL.
I WILL CALL HIM

04:13.319 --> 04:15.321
RIGHT AFTER
I'M DONE CHECKING ON
SOME THINGS.

NO. YOU NEED
TO GET YOUR BUTT
OUT OF HERE.

04:17.192 --> 04:19.368
GO. THE DEMONS
WILL SHOW UP EVENTUALLY.

THEY ALWAYS DO.

04:23.459 --> 04:25.026
GOOD LUCK.

04:25.200 --> 04:27.420
I'D RATHER DIE
THAN SPEND ETERNITY

HIDING OUT
IN SOME DINGY CAVE

04:29.335 --> 04:32.033
WHILE THE TRIAD LUXURIATES
UP AT MAGIC SCHOOL.

04:32.207 --> 04:33.774
THEIR RESURFACING
AFTER SO LONG AWAY

04:33.948 --> 04:35.471
OPENS OLD WOUNDS.

04:35.645 --> 04:37.865
THEY WERE WRONG
TO HAVE EXCOMMUNICATED
YOU, XAR.

04:38.039 --> 04:40.128
AND IT WILL BE
THEIR DOWNFALL.

04:40.302 --> 04:41.999
I HAVE NO DOUBT.
STILL--

04:42.174 --> 04:43.392
I KNOW THEIR WEAKNESS,

04:43.566 --> 04:45.394
WHAT THEY SO
DESPERATELY WANT.

04:45.568 --> 04:46.917
TO KILL
THE CHARMED ONES

04:47.092 --> 04:50.051
AND SHIFT THE BALANCE OF POWER
FROM GOOD TO EVIL,

04:50.225 --> 04:52.271
AND THE FACT
THEY JUST TOOK OVER
MAGIC SCHOOL

04:52.445 --> 04:54.403
TELLS ME THEY'RE CLOSE.

04:54.577 --> 04:57.232
ALL THE MORE REASON
TO STAY AWAY, I THINK.

04:57.406 --> 05:01.715
BUT IF THE CHARMED ONES KNEW
THE TRIAD WAS BACK,

05:01.889 --> 05:04.239
THEY'D WANT THEM
VANQUISHED AS MUCH AS I DO.

05:04.413 --> 05:07.286

TO GET THEM THE MESSAGE.

05:08.230 --> 05:11.072
OR RATHER,
YOU'LL HAVE TO FIND A WAY.

DUE RESPECT,

WAIT, SEE HOW

TO TAKE THE TRIAD OUT NOW

09:51.372 --> 09:52.938
WELL, THEY DON'T
WANT CHRISTY,
THANK GOD.

09:53.112 --> 09:55.071
I THINK THEY WERE COMING
TO TELL US ABOUT THE TRIAD.

09:55.245 --> 09:57.421
WHO ARE
SUPPOSEDLY DEAD.

09:57.595 --> 09:59.206
WE THOUGHT COLE
VANQUISHED THEM YEARS AGO.

09:59.380 --> 10:00.424
ARE THEY DANGEROUS?

10:00.598 --> 10:01.686
VERY.

10:01.860 --> 10:03.645
I'M NOT REALLY
UNDERSTANDING, THOUGH.

10:03.819 --> 10:06.430
WHY WOULD DEMONS
COME TO WARN US
ABOUT OTHER DEMONS?

10:06.604 --> 10:07.997
YEAH, I PROBABLY
SHOULD JUST GO
CHECK THE BOOK--

10:08.171 --> 10:10.260
NO! I CAN DO
THE RESEARCH.

10:10.434 --> 10:11.827
YOU NEED TO TALK
TO YOUR FIANCE.

10:11.915 --> 10:13.595
WE HAVE ENOUGH
FIREPOWER DOWN HERE.

10:13.679 --> 10:14.800
DON'T SAY
THE "F" WORD.

10:14.894 --> 10:16.092
FIREPOWER?

10:16.266 --> 10:17.415
GO.

10:17.539 --> 10:19.026
MAYBE WE SHOULD CALL
THE WHOLE THING OFF.

10:19.120 --> 10:20.435
DON'T EVEN THINK
ABOUT IT!

10:20.519 --> 10:22.661
LISTEN, THE PARTY
IS ON, DUDE.

10:22.789 --> 10:25.705
DUDE...THE HOUSE
IS A MESS.

10:25.879 --> 10:26.882
AND WHAT ELSE
IS NEW?

10:26.960 --> 10:28.744
OK? YOU TWO NEED
TO GO HANG OUT AT PHOEBE'S

10:28.918 --> 10:30.224
UNTIL WE KNOW
SOMETHING.

10:30.398 --> 10:31.617
COME ON. I'LL TAKE YOU.

10:31.791 --> 10:33.706
AND THEN YOU NEED TO GO
STRAIGHT TO HENRY

10:33.880 --> 10:35.359
BECAUSE I AIN'T THROWIN'
YOU AN ENGAGEMENT PARTY

10:35.533 --> 10:36.622
IS YOU AIN'T ENGAGED.

10:36.796 --> 10:37.840
DON'T THREATEN ME.

10:39.886 --> 10:41.539
HOW COULD YOU FAIL?!

10:41.714 --> 10:43.193
WE DIDN'T...EXACTLY!

10:43.367 --> 10:45.195
WE--WE WARNED THEM
ABOUT THE TRIAD!

10:45.369 --> 10:46.893
WE JUST DIDN'T
GET A CHANCE
TO ELABORATE.

10:47.067 --> 10:49.025
CIRIL WAS INCINERATED
BY A CHARMED ONE!

10:49.199 --> 10:50.505
NO. BY ANOTHER WITCH.

10:50.679 --> 10:52.725
THE SAME ONE WHO KNEW
THAT WE WERE DEMONS.

10:52.899 --> 10:55.075
AND THEY SEEMED
VERY PROTECTIVE OF HER.

10:56.163 --> 10:57.555
EXPLAIN.

10:57.730 --> 10:59.688
THEY RISKED THEMSELVES
SO SHE WOULDN'T GET HURT,

10:59.862 --> 11:02.909
EVEN THOUGH SHE DIDN'T
LOOK LIKE SHE NEEDED
MUCH PROTECTION.

11:03.083 --> 11:05.215
INTERESTING.

11:05.389 --> 11:09.089
A STRANGE,
POWERFUL WITCH APPEARS
IN THE CHARMED ONES' LIVES

11:09.263 --> 11:12.994
JUST AS THE TRIAD IS CLOSE
TO ACHIEVING ITS GOAL.

11:14.485 --> 11:16.574
I WONDER
IF SHE'S THE ONE?

11:16.749 --> 11:18.925
I DON'T FOLLOW.

11:19.281 --> 11:20.633
WHEN I WAS ONE OF THEM,

11:20.707 --> 11:22.811
THEY SPOKE OF GOING AFTER
THE COMING POWER.

11:22.985 --> 11:25.553
THE ULTIMATE POWER.

11:25.727 --> 11:27.032
AND YOU THINK
THAT MIGHT BE HER?

11:27.206 --> 11:28.686
IF SHE IS,

11:28.860 --> 11:31.950
WE NEED TO GET HER AWAY
FROM THE CHARMED ONES FAST.

11:32.124 --> 11:34.126
BUT THEN THEY'D
COME AFTER US.

11:34.301 --> 11:36.215
NOT IF THEY THINK
THE TRIAD TOOK HER.

11:36.390 --> 11:38.696
THEN THEY'D
GO AFTER THEM.

11:49.251 --> 11:50.339
HEY.

11:50.513 --> 11:52.254
OH, MY GOD.
I'M SO SORRY I'M LATE.

11:53.995 --> 11:55.953
OH, NO!
THE STORE'S CLOSED.

11:56.127 --> 11:57.694
YEAH, YEAH.
HEY, DON'T WORRY, THOUGH.

11:57.868 --> 11:59.740
I GOT TO WATCH
ANOTHER COUPLE
PICK OUT THEIR BAND.

11:59.914 --> 12:01.350
IT WAS...IT WAS
REALLY BEAUTIFUL.

12:01.524 --> 12:03.700
I'M SO SORRY.
RIGHT AFTER WE HUNG UP,

12:03.874 --> 12:05.049
THESE DEMONS
ATTACKED US, AND...

12:05.223 --> 12:06.790
DEMONS? ARE YOU OK?

12:06.964 --> 12:08.096
YEAH, WE'RE FINE.

12:08.270 --> 12:10.141
THEY WERE, IN
THEIR OWN SPECIAL WAY,

12:10.315 --> 12:12.753
COMING TO WARN US
ABOUT THIS GROUP
CALLED THE TRIAD,

12:12.787 --> 12:13.841
WHO WE THOUGHT
WERE DEAD,

12:14.015 --> 12:15.057
BUT APPARENTLY AREN'T,

12:15.191 --> 12:16.544
WHICH IS KIND OF
FREAKING US OUT
A LITTLE BIT.

12:16.654 --> 12:17.829
I'LL EXPLAIN
MORE ABOUT
THAT WHOLE THING LATER.

12:18.003 --> 12:19.440
PAIGE, LOOK, IF YOU HAVE
TOO MUCH GOIN' ON,

12:19.614 --> 12:20.832
IF YOU CAN'T DEAL
WITH THIS WEDDING
RIGHT NOW...

12:21.006 --> 12:23.728
NO. OF COURSE
I CAN DEAL
WITH THE WEDDING

12:23.842 --> 12:27.756
AND PICKING OUT BANDS
AND, YOU KNOW,

12:27.880 --> 12:30.487
DEALING WITH TOOTHPASTE
CAPS AND SNORING.

12:30.601 --> 12:32.215
UH...SNORING?

12:34.141 --> 12:35.248
IT'S NOTHING.

12:36.006 --> 12:37.405
DIDN'T SOUND
LIKE NOTHING.

12:37.519 --> 12:40.062
WELL, EVERY COUPLE
HAS THEIR LITTLE QUIRKS
AND THEIR ISSUES.

12:40.157 --> 12:42.186
ISSUES? ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT

12:42.250 --> 12:43.357
NOT NAILING DOWN
THE WEDDING DATE

12:43.472 --> 12:45.126
OR ARE YOU TALKING
ABOUT NOT HAVING
A GUEST LIST?

12:45.300 --> 12:46.736
OK, BY GUEST LIST,
YOU'RE SAYING

12:46.910 --> 12:48.694
YOU'RE NOT REALLY
INTERESTED IN JUST HAVING

12:48.868 --> 12:51.567
A BAREFOOT-ON-THE-BEACH
WEDDING IN FIJI?

12:51.741 --> 12:54.091
NO. BECAUSE I WOULD
LIKE TO LIFT
A WEDDING VEIL,

12:54.265 --> 12:55.919
NOT A MOSQUITO NET
WHEN I'M GONNA
KISS YOU.

12:56.093 --> 12:58.394
HA HA! DOES EVERY COUPLE
GO THROUGH THIS?

12:58.508 --> 12:59.639
HOLD ON NOW.

12:59.743 --> 13:02.186
I WANT TO GO BACK
TO THE SMALL ISSUE
HERE OF TOOTHPASTE.

13:02.360 --> 13:04.232
WHAT? YOU DON'T PUT
THE CAP BACK ON!

13:04.406 --> 13:07.496
OK. WELL, YOU SQUEEZE
FROM THE MIDDLE.

13:07.670 --> 13:08.932
UHH!

13:09.106 --> 13:10.760
BY THE WAY, I AM
NOT WEARING A VEIL.

13:10.934 --> 13:12.762
HOW CAN YOU
GET MARRIED WITHOUT
WEARING A VEIL?

13:12.936 --> 13:14.894
WELL, IF YOU WANT ONE SO MUCH,
WHY DON'T YOU WEAR IT?

13:15.068 --> 13:17.070
I--I...

13:21.113 --> 13:23.251
Christy:
IT'S FUNNY. I REMEMBER
DOING THIS TO YOU

13:23.425 --> 13:24.532
WHEN WE WERE LITTLE.

13:24.646 --> 13:25.671
Billie: OH, REALLY?

13:25.795 --> 13:28.952
YEAH. MANICURE,
PEDICURE, THE WORKS.

13:29.126 --> 13:31.041
WE HAD FUN
PLAYING DRESS UP.

13:31.215 --> 13:32.608
WELL, I THINK
I WAS A LITTLE YOUNG
TO REMEMBER,

13:32.782 --> 13:33.913
BUT I HAVE TO SAY,
I KNOW YOU LIVED
IN A CAVE

13:34.087 --> 13:35.263
AND IT WAS TERRIBLE,

13:35.437 --> 13:36.779
BUT IT DID WONDERS
FOR YOUR COMPLEXION.

13:36.913 --> 13:39.267
HEH.

13:39.441 --> 13:40.920
THERE YOU GO.

13:41.094 --> 13:43.271
OH, SWEETIE,
YOU LOOK SO BEAUTIFUL.

13:43.445 --> 13:44.446
SHE'S A TOTAL BABE.

13:44.620 --> 13:46.099
YOU ARE
A TOTAL KNOCKOUT.

13:46.274 --> 13:47.405
[DOOR OPENS]

13:49.320 --> 13:51.627
OH, WHOOPS.
THIS ISN'T RIGHT.

13:52.976 --> 13:54.369
HEY...

13:54.543 --> 13:56.860
HEY, I SAW YOU
AT THE CAFE EARLIER,
DIDN'T I?

13:57.005 --> 13:59.112
YES, YOU DID,
WHICH MAKES ME
WONDER EVEN MORE

13:59.287 --> 14:00.679
WHAT YOU'RE DOING
IN MY HOUSE.

14:00.853 --> 14:02.725
OH, YEAH. YEAH.
SORRY ABOUT THAT.

14:02.899 --> 14:05.059
I'M NEW HERE.
MUST HAVE GOTTEN OFF
ON THE WRONG FLOOR.

14:05.193 --> 14:06.616
AN UNDERSTANDABLE
MISTAKE.

14:06.760 --> 14:08.034
OHH.

14:09.427 --> 14:10.776
WHY DOES YOUR KEY
WORK?

14:10.950 --> 14:12.865
HMM. I DON'T KNOW.

14:13.039 --> 14:14.262
THAT'S A WEIRD ONE.

14:14.376 --> 14:15.475
HMM.

14:15.579 --> 14:17.174
HAVE TO TALK
TO THE BROKER
ABOUT THAT.

14:18.436 --> 14:20.133
ANYWAY, LADIES,
I APOLOGIZE.

14:20.308 --> 14:21.352
HAVE
A WONDERFUL EVENING.

14:21.526 --> 14:23.224
LISTEN, IF YOU EVER
NEED ANYTHING,

14:23.398 --> 14:25.138
I LIVE
RIGHT BELOW YOU,
SO DON'T HESITATE.

14:25.313 --> 14:28.011
EVEN IF IT IS
JUST FOR A...

14:28.185 --> 14:29.578
A CUP OF SUGAR
OR SOMETHING.

14:32.456 --> 14:33.675
HMM. HMM.

14:33.849 --> 14:36.721
OK, BLOWING THAT HOT GUY
OFF ONCE, MAYBE,

14:36.895 --> 14:38.201
BUT HE JUST LANDED
IN YOUR APARTMENT,

14:38.375 --> 14:39.637
AND YOU LET HIM
LEAVE?

14:39.811 --> 14:42.771
YOU HAVE TO ADMIT,
THAT'S KIND OF SUSPICIOUS.

14:42.945 --> 14:46.153
I--I MEAN, YOU MUST
HAVE GOT SOME SORT
OF VIBE OFF HIM.

14:46.267 --> 14:48.549
- DID YOU? - NO. I THOUGHT
HE WAS CUTE.

14:48.673 --> 14:49.681
YEAH.

14:49.765 --> 14:51.027
PLEASE.
WHAT DO YOU KNOW?

14:51.201 --> 14:53.334
YOU WERE RAISED BY DEMONS,
FOR GOD'S SAKES.

14:53.408 --> 14:54.496
ALL RIGHT, WHATEVER.

14:54.630 --> 14:56.206
COME ON. LET'S GO
TRY THIS DRESS ON.

14:57.062 --> 15:00.558
EXCUSE ME. I THINK
I CAN DRESS MYSELF BY NOW.

15:00.732 --> 15:01.746
OHH!
OHH!

15:01.820 --> 15:03.126
WELL,
THAT'S PROGRESS.

15:03.300 --> 15:06.042
LITTLE SNIPPY,
BUT PROGRESS.

15:06.216 --> 15:07.217
[GASPS]
UHH!

15:08.697 --> 15:10.133
CHRISTY.

15:11.177 --> 15:12.222
[GASPS]

15:15.356 --> 15:16.444
THE TRIAD.

15:21.066 --> 15:22.167
HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?

15:22.341 --> 15:23.734
WHY COULDN'T
I STOP HIM?

15:23.908 --> 15:25.555
BECAUSE
YOU JUST COULDN'T.
I COULDN'T, EITHER.

15:25.699 --> 15:27.551
HE WAS IN THERE
WAITING FOR HER.

15:27.678 --> 15:29.062
AND YOU'RE SURE
IT WAS THE TRIAD?

15:29.176 --> 15:30.177
WELL, IT'S
NOT THE KIND OF ROBE

15:30.291 --> 15:31.941
YOU FIND AT NORDSTROM'S,
YOU KNOW?

15:32.040 --> 15:35.143
SO I DON'T UNDERSTAND. THE GUYS THAT
KIDNAPPED HER 15 YEARS AGO

15:35.317 --> 15:36.579
WERE JUST FRONT MEN?

15:36.753 --> 15:37.971
WELL, IT KIND OF
MAKES SENSE,

15:38.146 --> 15:39.625
ESPECIALLY IF SHE'S
THE KEY TO THE POWER.

15:39.799 --> 15:42.193
WHICH IF THE TRIAD GETS,
WE'RE SCREWED.

15:42.367 --> 15:43.803
WELL, WHO CARES?

15:43.977 --> 15:45.681
ALL I CARE ABOUT IS GETTING
HER BACK BEFORE THEY...

15:45.805 --> 15:46.884
Phoebe:
THEY WON'T HURT HER.

15:47.030 --> 15:48.031
THEY NEED HER.

15:48.205 --> 15:49.554
WE JUST NEED
TO GET HER BACK

15:49.728 --> 15:51.730
BEFORE THEY GET
WHATEVER IT IS
THEY'RE AFTER.

15:51.904 --> 15:53.384
I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY THOSE DEMONS

15:53.558 --> 15:54.864
WARNED US ABOUT THEM.

15:55.038 --> 15:56.474
WELL, THEY DON'T
WANT THE TRIAD
TAKING OVER

15:56.648 --> 15:57.954
ANY MORE
THAN WE DO.

15:58.128 --> 15:59.607
THEY PROBABLY THOUGHT
WE WOULD TAKE THEM OUT.

15:59.781 --> 16:02.175
YOU KNOW, THIS MIGHT
BE THE FIGHT

16:02.349 --> 16:04.308
THAT THE ANGEL OF DESTINY
WAS TALKING ABOUT.

16:05.487 --> 16:06.614
AND IF WE WIN...

16:06.788 --> 16:09.749
WE COULD
GET LEO BACK.

16:09.953 --> 16:12.229
OK. WELL, I'M GONNA START
BY CHECKING INTO THAT GUY

16:12.403 --> 16:13.883
THAT BROKE
INTO MY APARTMENT.

16:14.057 --> 16:15.972
YOU REALLY THINK
HE'S PART OF THIS?

16:16.146 --> 16:17.364
YES!

16:20.587 --> 16:22.587
WE'RE GONNA GET
YOUR SISTER BACK, BILLIE,

16:22.761 --> 16:24.110
ONE WAY OR ANOTHER.

16:24.284 --> 16:25.851
AND LEO, TOO.

16:31.161 --> 16:33.083
SHE'S
THE ULTIMATE POWER?

16:33.157 --> 16:34.294
DOUBTFUL.

16:34.468 --> 16:35.948
SHE WAS TOO EASY
TO TAKE.

16:36.122 --> 16:38.472
MORE LIKELY
AN UNSUSPECTING CONDUIT.

16:38.646 --> 16:41.475
STILL, AS LONG
AS WE HAVE HER,

16:41.649 --> 16:43.390
THE TRIAD DOESN'T.

16:43.564 --> 16:44.609
DO YOU REALLY THINK
THE CHARMED ONES

16:44.783 --> 16:46.176
WILL GO AFTER THEM
INSTEAD OF US?

16:46.280 --> 16:47.307
SHH!

16:47.481 --> 16:48.656
[WHISPERING]
That's the plan.

16:48.830 --> 16:50.397
But what if they don't?

16:50.571 --> 16:52.878
THEN WE'RE DEAD.

16:53.052 --> 16:55.707
BUT THAT'S STILL BETTER
THAN HAVING TO ANSWER
TO THE TRIAD.

16:57.883 --> 17:01.931
AH! FINALLY WAKING,
ARE WE?

17:02.105 --> 17:04.803
CARE TO TELL US
WHAT YOU KNOW ABOUT
THE ULTIMATE POWER?

17:04.977 --> 17:06.065
NO!

17:06.239 --> 17:08.154
AAH!

17:08.328 --> 17:09.373
[GASPS]

17:09.547 --> 17:10.548
SPUNKY.

17:10.722 --> 17:13.899
BUT YOU'LL TALK...
EVENTUALLY.

17:14.073 --> 17:15.683
UHH.

17:15.857 --> 17:17.120
UHH!

17:18.740 --> 17:20.011
I KNEW IT.

17:29.654 --> 17:31.873
WELL, TOOK YOU
LONG ENOUGH.

17:32.048 --> 17:33.788
UNH!

17:35.834 --> 17:36.966
[GROANING]

17:37.140 --> 17:38.576
HA HA...

17:38.750 --> 17:42.188
WELL, LOVE IS NEVER HAVING
TO SAY YOU'RE SORRY.

17:42.362 --> 17:44.321
UNH!

17:45.727 --> 17:47.933
AH! THAT'S NICE.

17:48.107 --> 17:49.804
VERY NICE.

17:50.807 --> 17:53.721
OK, NOW...

17:53.895 --> 17:56.115
YOU LIE AWAKE AT NIGHT.

17:56.289 --> 17:59.205
YOU'RE AFRAID THAT YOU
MAY NEVER FIND LOVE AGAIN.

17:59.379 --> 18:01.816
THE BEST YEARS
OF YOUR LIFE LOST,

18:01.991 --> 18:03.470

FOR THE GREATER GOOD,

18:03.644 --> 18:06.691
BUT AT THE COST
OF STARTING
YOUR OWN FAMILY.

18:08.258 --> 18:09.911
WELL, THAT OUGHT TO DO IT.

18:14.612 --> 18:17.006
AAH! OH!

18:17.180 --> 18:18.181
YOU DON'T NEED
TO FIGHT ME, PHOEBE.

18:18.355 --> 18:19.880
- I'M ON YOUR SIDE.
- LIKE HELL, YOU ARE.

18:19.984 --> 18:21.793
JUST SIT DOWN, OK?

18:21.967 --> 18:23.984
LISTEN, NOW YOU
WERE JUST THINKING

18:24.108 --> 18:25.849
HOW YOU LAY AWAKE
AT NIGHT, RIGHT?

18:26.065 --> 18:28.818
HOW YOU'RE AFRAID
THAT YOU MAY NEVER
FIND LOVE AGAIN?

18:28.902 --> 18:30.199
UM, IT'S NOT FAIR,
REALLY.

18:30.373 --> 18:32.114
I ALREADY KNOW
I'M RIGHT.

18:32.178 --> 18:33.246
WHO ARE YOU?

18:33.420 --> 18:34.464
I'M CUPID.

18:34.508 --> 18:35.814
I'M ONE OF THEM
ANYWAY.

18:35.988 --> 18:37.250
YOU CAN CALL ME
COOP.

18:37.424 --> 18:40.906
[LAUGHING] THAT'S
JUST GREAT, COOP,

18:41.080 --> 18:42.081
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

18:42.255 --> 18:43.343
I DON'T HAVE
THE TIME FOR THIS

18:43.517 --> 18:44.648
BECAUSE I NEED TO GO
FIND MY SISTERS.

18:44.823 --> 18:46.172
YOU ALWAYS SAY THAT,

18:46.346 --> 18:47.869
AND THAT IS EXACTLY
WHY I'M HERE.

18:48.043 --> 18:50.002
YOU ALWAYS THINK
THAT YOU NEVER
HAVE TIME FOR LOVE.

18:50.176 --> 18:51.786
THAT'S WHY
THE ELDERS SENT ME.

18:51.960 --> 18:53.353
THEY FEEL GUILTY,
YOU KNOW?

18:53.527 --> 18:55.268
ABOUT HOW EVERYTHING
GOT ALL MESSED UP

18:55.442 --> 18:56.443
AFTER THEY ENLISTED YOU.

18:56.617 --> 18:57.966
SO THEY SENT ME DOWN

18:58.140 --> 19:00.186
TO HELP YOU GET THINGS
BACK ON TRACK.

19:00.360 --> 19:01.448
OH, OK,
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?

19:01.622 --> 19:03.537
I DON'T NEED HELP
FINDING TRUE LOVE.

19:03.711 --> 19:05.017
WELL, APPARENTLY,
YOU DO.

19:05.191 --> 19:06.322
EXCUSE ME?!

19:06.496 --> 19:07.671
YOU DIDN'T EVEN
NOTICE ME AT THE CAFE.

19:07.846 --> 19:09.543
OH! WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?

19:09.717 --> 19:11.850
I DIDN'T NOTICE YOU
AT THE CAFE

19:12.024 --> 19:13.721
BECAUSE YOU'RE--PFF!

19:13.895 --> 19:15.331
YOU ARE JUST NOT CUTE.

19:15.505 --> 19:17.856
NO, I'M CUTE.
YOU'RE RESISTANT.

19:18.030 --> 19:19.771
OH!

19:19.945 --> 19:21.381
NOW, COME ON.
HOW YOU GONNA HAVE
THAT FUTURE CHILD

19:21.555 --> 19:22.975
THAT YOU WERE
PROMISED UNLESS
YOU FIND LOVE FIRST?

19:23.079 --> 19:24.210
RIGHT?

19:25.524 --> 19:27.213
THAT'S STILL POSSIBLE?

19:27.387 --> 19:28.562
NOT ONLY IS IT POSSIBLE,

19:28.736 --> 19:29.824
IT'S DESTINED.

19:31.217 --> 19:32.522
WE ARE GONNA
HAVE TO HURRY.

19:32.696 --> 19:34.437
BUT MY STAR CHARTS--

19:34.611 --> 19:36.744
ALL WONKY. I'M SORRY.
YOUR MATH STINKS.

19:36.918 --> 19:38.398
ANYWAY, I'LL SHOW YOU
ABOUT THAT LATER.

19:38.572 --> 19:41.227
FIRST, WE'RE GONNA
HEAL YOUR HEART.

19:41.401 --> 19:44.360
NO. FIRST, I NEED TO GO
KILL SOME DEMONS

19:44.534 --> 19:46.710
BECAUSE IF I DON'T,
NONE OF THIS
IS GONNA MATTER, OK?

19:46.885 --> 19:48.800
WAIT. YOU'RE RESISTING.

19:48.974 --> 19:50.758
YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU CAN TAKE
THAT BOW AND ARROW

19:50.932 --> 19:52.412
AND SHOVE IT UP
YOUR, UH...

19:52.586 --> 19:54.588
AND DON'T EVEN TRY
TO FREEZE ME

19:54.762 --> 19:56.111
BECAUSE I WILL
VANQUISH YOU.

19:58.810 --> 20:00.246
OOH!

20:00.420 --> 20:03.031
WELL, THIS IS GONNA BE
TOUGHER THAN I THOUGHT.

20:03.205 --> 20:06.121
HEY, HENRY, CAN YOU
PLEASE DO ME A HUGE FAVOR?

20:06.295 --> 20:08.776
I NEED YOU TO CALL
EVERYBODY ON THE LIST
FOR OUR PARTY AND CANCEL.

20:08.950 --> 20:11.257
CA--PAIGE, WE CAN'T
CANCEL ON THEM.

20:11.431 --> 20:12.588
IT'S TOMORROW NIGHT.

20:12.702 --> 20:14.651
LOOK, THERE MIGHT NOT
BE A TOMORROW NIGHT
FOR US, OK?

20:14.826 --> 20:16.088
I HAVE TO DEAL
WITH THE TRIAD.

20:17.524 --> 20:19.265
THE TRIAD.

20:19.439 --> 20:20.788
RIGHT, THE TRIAD.

20:22.834 --> 20:23.965
YOU KNOW,
I JUST THOUGHT...

20:24.139 --> 20:26.576
I THOUGHT WE WERE
WORKING ON IT.

20:26.750 --> 20:27.969
WELL, I THOUGHT
WE WERE WORKING
ON IT, TOO.

20:28.143 --> 20:29.362
BUT, SADLY,
THEY'VE COME BACK.

20:29.536 --> 20:30.885
CAN YOU PLEASE
JUST MAKE THE CALL?

20:31.059 --> 20:32.844
OK.

20:34.062 --> 20:35.107
YES, MA'AM.

20:38.980 --> 20:40.677
HEY, THERE.
HOW'S IT GOIN'?

20:40.852 --> 20:43.115
NOT GOOD. THERE'S
NO KNOWN WAY
TO VANQUISH THEM.

20:43.289 --> 20:45.465
WELL, THAT'S, UM...
REALLY GREAT NEWS.

20:45.639 --> 20:48.947
DO YOU THINK IT'S ODD
THAT THEY WENT AFTER CHRISTY

20:49.121 --> 20:50.644
AND DIDN'T EVEN
TRY TO FIGHT US?

20:50.818 --> 20:53.429
NO. THE TRIAD THINKS
SHE'S THE KEY TO
WHAT THEY WANT,

20:53.603 --> 20:55.692
AND ONCE THEY GET IT,
WE MAY BE OBSOLETE.

20:55.867 --> 20:56.998
Billie:
POWER OF THE WITCHES RISE,

20:57.172 --> 20:58.434
COURSE UNSEEN
ACROSS THE SKIES.

20:58.608 --> 20:59.609
COME TO US
WHO CALL YOU NOW...

20:59.783 --> 21:01.133
HOW LONG HAS SHE
BEEN DOING THAT?

21:01.307 --> 21:02.699
SINCE WE'VE
BEEN UP HERE,

21:02.874 --> 21:04.876
AND SHE'S WORKING
ON AN ENHANCING POTION

21:05.050 --> 21:06.312
TO MAKE THE SPELL
STRONGER.

21:06.486 --> 21:07.661
HMM.

21:08.792 --> 21:10.794
UM...

21:10.969 --> 21:13.188
BILLIE, THE THING IS,
IF THAT SPELL HASN'T
WORKED BY NOW,

21:13.362 --> 21:14.541
IT'S NOT GONNA WORK.

21:14.666 --> 21:15.799
WELL, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT ELSE TO DO.

21:15.974 --> 21:17.018
I HAVE TO DO
SOMETHING.

21:17.102 --> 21:18.106
WE'RE GONNA
GET HER BACK.

21:18.280 --> 21:20.630
OK?

21:20.804 --> 21:22.067
I'M GONNA GO SCRY.

21:31.685 --> 21:32.991

WHO CALL YOU NEAR,

21:33.165 --> 21:34.470
COME TO US
AND SETTLE HERE.

21:34.644 --> 21:38.257
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHO YOU'RE DEALING WITH!

21:38.431 --> 21:40.389
I MAY NOT KNOW
EXACTLY WHO YOU ARE,

21:40.563 --> 21:42.565
BUT I KNOW YOU HAVE SOMETHING
THE TRIAD'S BEEN WANTING

21:42.739 --> 21:44.654
FOR A VERY LONG TIME.

21:44.828 --> 21:47.005
AND IT BRINGS ME
UNTOLD JOY

21:47.179 --> 21:48.528
TO THINK THAT I'LL
RUIN THEIR PLAN

21:48.702 --> 21:50.660
JUST AS IT'S ABOUT
TO REACH FRUITION.

21:50.834 --> 21:52.271
LET ME OUT OF HERE!

21:52.445 --> 21:53.837
WE'RE NOT GOING TO GET
ANYTHING OUT OF HER.

21:53.912 --> 21:54.969
NO MATTER.

21:55.143 --> 21:56.884
WE JUST NEED
TO HOLD ONTO HER

21:57.058 --> 21:59.669
UNTIL THE BATTLE
BETWEEN THE CHARMED ONES
AND THE TRIAD IS OVER.

21:59.843 --> 22:03.021
THEN WE'LL SEE
WHO'S LEFT STANDING.

22:07.373 --> 22:08.547
UNH!

22:11.203 --> 22:12.595

AND GRUNTING]

22:30.483 --> 22:31.757
CHRISTY?

22:34.226 --> 22:35.357
WHAT HAPPENED?

22:35.411 --> 22:36.489
IT WORKED!

22:36.533 --> 22:37.653
OH!

22:37.707 --> 22:39.666
I WAS IN A CAGE.

22:39.840 --> 22:43.409
UM, I GOT OUT,
BUT THEN THEY CAME
AFTER ME AGAIN...

22:44.230 --> 22:45.585
AND THEN I WAS HERE.

22:45.759 --> 22:46.803
WHAT DID THEY WANT?
DID THEY SAY?

22:46.978 --> 22:48.368
Christy:
I DON'T KNOW.

22:48.618 --> 22:49.666
I WAS SCARED.

22:49.750 --> 22:51.012
IT'S OK.
YOU'RE SAFE NOW.

22:51.186 --> 22:52.535
WELL, THE TRIAD
IS GONNA FIGURE OUT

22:52.710 --> 22:53.928
WHERE SHE IS
SOONER OR LATER.

22:54.102 --> 22:56.148
WE NEED TO STOP THEM
WHILE WE HAVE A CHANCE.

22:56.322 --> 22:57.715
OK, I'M GONNA
GO GET PHOEBE.

23:02.632 --> 23:03.808
ARE YOU OK?

23:03.982 --> 23:06.593
YEAH. I JUST NEED
TO LIE DOWN.

23:06.767 --> 23:07.942
YEAH, COME ON.
LET'S GO.

23:08.116 --> 23:11.380
NO, IT'S OK. YOU STAY
HERE AND HELP HER.

23:11.554 --> 23:12.599
I'LL BE FINE.

23:47.199 --> 23:49.201
SOMEBODY'S
IMPERSONATING YOU.

23:55.268 --> 23:56.922
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
IMPERSONATING US?

23:57.096 --> 23:58.154
HOW DO YOU KNOW?

23:58.228 --> 23:59.359
WILL YOU KEEP
YOUR VOICE DOWN?

23:59.534 --> 24:00.752
I DON'T WANT THEM
TO FIND US TOGETHER.

24:00.926 --> 24:03.494
I ALWAYS SAID THIS PLAN
WAS TAKING TOO LONG.

24:03.668 --> 24:05.496
WE SHOULD JUST ATTACK
THE CHARMED ONES
WHILE WE'RE HERE.

24:05.670 --> 24:08.064
NO. WE DON'T HAVE
THE POWER YET.

24:08.238 --> 24:10.240
AND WE'RE NOT
STRONG ENOUGH WITHOUT IT.

24:10.414 --> 24:11.589
WE DON'T KNOW THAT.

24:11.763 --> 24:14.897
BESIDES, SOMEONE'S
ALREADY EXPOSED US.

24:15.071 --> 24:17.900
YES. THE REAL QUESTION
IS, WHO?

24:18.074 --> 24:20.119
WHO ELSE?
IT HAS TO BE XAR.

24:20.293 --> 24:21.468
XAR? WHO IS XAR?

24:21.643 --> 24:24.559
A DEMON WHO WAS
ONCE ONE OF US.

24:24.733 --> 24:26.299
BUT ONE
WHOM WE BANISHED.

24:26.473 --> 24:29.172
AND ONE WHO'S BEEN
LOOKING TO AVENGE
THAT FOR DECADES.

24:29.346 --> 24:32.131
HE'S THE ONLY ONE
WHO KNOWS OUR WAYS
AND OUR DESIRES.

24:32.305 --> 24:33.872
SO, WHAT?
HE'S BEEN SABOTAGING US?

24:34.046 --> 24:36.527
UNDOUBTEDLY,
SO HE WON'T HAVE
TO ANSWER TO US.

24:36.701 --> 24:39.399
XAR WOULD DO ANYTHING
TO KEEP THAT
FROM HAPPENING.

24:39.574 --> 24:41.401
WELL, HE MAY
HAVE ALREADY SUCCEEDED.

24:41.576 --> 24:44.535
THE CHARMED ONES
ARE AFTER YOU NOW.

24:46.755 --> 24:48.321
WHICH MEANS I MAY NEVER
GET BILLIE BACK.

24:48.495 --> 24:49.801
YES, YOU WILL,

24:49.975 --> 24:51.934
JUST AS WE PROMISED.

24:52.108 --> 24:53.588
YOU'RE STILL THE KEY,

24:53.762 --> 24:56.199
AND YOU'RE STILL
IN PERFECT POSITION.

24:56.373 --> 24:57.809
YOU'RE
HER SISTER, CHRISTY.

24:57.983 --> 25:00.203
SOON, YOU WILL
SHOW HER THE WAY.

25:00.377 --> 25:03.554
IF WE CAN STOP XAR
FROM DOING ANY MORE DAMAGE.

25:20.895 --> 25:22.201
HEY! HOW'D IT GO?

25:22.375 --> 25:23.420
WAS THE HOT GUY
A TRIAD?

25:23.594 --> 25:25.335
HE'S WORSE.
HE'S A CUPID.

25:25.509 --> 25:26.640
A WHAT?!

25:26.814 --> 25:28.425
A CUPID. THE ELDERS
SENT HIM DOWN HERE

25:28.599 --> 25:29.774
TO HELP ME FIND
TRUE LOVE.

25:29.948 --> 25:31.123
HOW INSULTING IS THAT?!

25:31.297 --> 25:33.299
WELL, MAYBE THEY FIGURE
THEY OWE YOU.

25:33.473 --> 25:35.562
WELL, I WISH THEY'D HELP
WITH THE TRIADS FIRST

25:35.736 --> 25:37.608
BECAUSE I HAVE NO IDEA
HOW TO VANQUISH THEM.

25:37.782 --> 25:39.262
WELL, WHAT
DID COLE DO?

25:39.436 --> 25:40.741
WELL, I DON'T KNOW.

25:40.915 --> 25:43.440
HE WAS
A REALLY POWERFUL DEMON.

25:43.614 --> 25:45.746
PROBABLY JUST AS POWERFUL
AS THEY WERE.

25:45.920 --> 25:48.009
YOU KNOW WHAT? COLE
WAS MY LONGEST RELATIONSHIP.

25:48.184 --> 25:49.446
IS THAT PATHETIC,
OR WHAT?

25:49.620 --> 25:51.143
ACTUALLY, YOU MIGHT
BE ONTO SOMETHING.

25:51.317 --> 25:53.972
MAYBE WE NEED A DEMON
TO VANQUISH THEM.

25:54.146 --> 25:56.104
ARE YOU KIDDING?
WHERE ARE WE GONNA
FIND ONE OF THOSE?

25:56.279 --> 25:57.715
WELL, I DON'T THINK
WE'D NEED TO

25:57.889 --> 25:59.064
IF WE JUST GET THE TRIADS
TO KILL EACH OTHER.

25:59.238 --> 26:01.675
UH...HOW DO YOU PROPOSE
WE DO THAT?

26:01.849 --> 26:03.460
I DON'T KNOW.
I'M MAKIN'
THIS UP AS I GO.

26:03.634 --> 26:05.375
WHAT IF WE DON'T
GET THEM ALL?

26:05.549 --> 26:06.616
Piper: I DON'T THINK
WE NEED TO.

26:06.680 --> 26:07.738
IF WE JUST KILL ONE,

26:07.812 --> 26:09.397
THEN WE WEAKEN
THE COLLECTIVE.

26:09.491 --> 26:10.611
KIND OF LIKE US.

26:10.715 --> 26:11.859

26:11.943 --> 26:12.991
IT'S STILL DICEY.

26:13.065 --> 26:14.144
DICEY'S ALL WE GOT.

26:14.240 --> 26:15.459
WELL, WE BETTER
DO SOMETHING FAST,

26:15.633 --> 26:16.982
OR WE'RE NOT GONNA
BE ABLE TO SAVE CHRISTY.

26:17.156 --> 26:18.636
OR LEO, FOR THAT MATTER.

26:18.810 --> 26:20.725

REALLY IS THE BIG THREAT.

26:20.899 --> 26:22.858
AND WE'RE IN
FOR A HUGE BATTLE.

TO GET THE KIDS
OUT OF HERE.

TO GO SEE HENRY.

CAN IT WAIT?

26:29.865 --> 26:30.909
NO, IT CAN'T.

26:31.083 --> 26:32.824
LOOK, IF SOMETHING
HAPPENS TO ME,

26:32.998 --> 26:34.870
I DON'T WANT THE LAST THING
HENRY REMEMBERS ABOUT US

26:35.044 --> 26:36.306
IS ARGUING.

26:36.480 --> 26:38.003
WELL, WE DON'T HAVE
A LOT OF TIME.

26:38.177 --> 26:39.222
I NEED TO DO THIS.

26:39.396 --> 26:40.450
SORRY.

26:40.484 --> 26:41.877

[DROPPING PEBBLES]

26:48.579 --> 26:49.710
HOW DID YOU FIND ME?

26:49.885 --> 26:52.322
THE WITCH LED US
TO YOU, XAR.

26:52.496 --> 26:55.978
YOU SHOULD HAVE
KILLED HER WHILE
YOU HAD THE CHANCE.

26:56.152 --> 26:58.448
YOU KNOW ME
BETTER THAN THAT,
ASMODEUS.

26:58.553 --> 27:00.721

WHY YOU NEEDED HER.

ARE BEHIND US.

ARE FEW, THANKS TO ME.

27:19.697 --> 27:21.612
IF YOU HAD THE POWER
TO TAKE THEM ON,

27:21.786 --> 27:23.483
YOU WOULD HAVE
DONE SO BY NOW.

27:32.536 --> 27:34.799
SEE YOU
IN THE WASTELAND.

27:37.889 --> 27:39.499
HE'S RIGHT.

27:39.673 --> 27:41.719
THE CHARMED ONES
WILL BE COMING FOR US,

27:41.893 --> 27:44.548
AND WITHOUT THE POWER,
WE'LL NEVER BE ABLE
TO DEFEAT THEM.

27:44.722 --> 27:45.941
WE DON'T KNOW THAT!

27:46.115 --> 27:48.552
BESIDES, WE ONLY
HAVE TO TAKE ONE OUT

27:48.726 --> 27:50.075
TO WEAKEN
THEIR POWER OF THREE.

27:50.249 --> 27:51.685
BUT THAT'S
OUR WEAKNESS, TOO.

27:51.860 --> 27:53.426
THAT'S WHY WE
EMBARKED ON THE PLAN

27:53.600 --> 27:55.776
ALL THOSE YEARS AGO
TO USE CHRISTY.

27:55.951 --> 27:57.256
WITHOUT THE POWER,

27:57.430 --> 28:00.651
WE ARE TOO CLOSELY MATCHED
TO ENSURE SUCCESS.

28:00.825 --> 28:02.566
WE DON'T HAVE A CHOICE
NOW, DO WE?

28:04.133 --> 28:06.135
IT'S KILL OR BE KILLED NOW.

28:10.617 --> 28:12.924
THAT'S ALL I HAVE
ON HIM RIGHT THERE.

28:13.008 --> 28:14.926
OK. GOTCHA.
SEE YA.

28:15.100 --> 28:16.124
AHH...HENRY.

28:16.188 --> 28:17.668
HEY.
HEY.

28:17.732 --> 28:18.892
WHAT ARE YOU
DOIN' HERE?

28:18.987 --> 28:20.105
UH, I NEED
TO TALK TO YOU.

28:20.279 --> 28:22.107
- OK.
- WILL YOU COME WITH ME?

28:22.281 --> 28:24.283
SURE. WAIT. IS THERE
SOMETHING WRONG?

28:24.457 --> 28:25.589
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

28:25.763 --> 28:28.679
I'M OK.
WELL, UH, NO.
NOT REALLY.

28:28.853 --> 28:33.162
UM, I JUST REALLY
WANTED TO SEE YOU
JUST IN CASE...

28:33.336 --> 28:34.990
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, PAIGE.

28:35.164 --> 28:36.252
WHAT'S WRONG?

28:40.125 --> 28:42.084
WE'RE GOING UP
AGAINST THE TRIAD.

28:42.258 --> 28:43.433
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

28:43.607 --> 28:45.870
WELL, IT MEANS,
IF WE WIN THIS BATTLE,

28:46.044 --> 28:47.741
IT'LL BE A VERY,
VERY GOOD THING,

28:47.916 --> 28:49.874
AND WE CAN GET LEO BACK,

28:50.048 --> 28:53.138
AND EVERYTHING'LL BE
SUPER HAPPY AND PERFECT,

28:53.312 --> 28:57.099
AND I WON'T EVEN CARE
IF YOU LEAVE THE CAP
OFF THE TOOTHPASTE.

28:57.273 --> 28:59.362
WHAT IF YOU DON'T WIN?

29:00.885 --> 29:02.104
ALL RIGHT,
I'M GOING WITH YOU.

29:02.278 --> 29:03.888
WE'LL DO IT TOGETHER.

29:04.062 --> 29:05.629
I CAN'T SIT HERE
AND DO NOTHING.

29:05.803 --> 29:08.632
YOU CAN'T. IT HAS TO BE
JUST THE 3 OF US.

29:10.186 --> 29:11.374
ALL RIGHT.

29:11.548 --> 29:13.028
WHEN YOU GET BACK,

29:13.202 --> 29:15.987
I'M GONNA MARRY YOU
AS SOON AS I CAN.

29:16.161 --> 29:17.336
AT THE ENGAGEMENT PARTY.

29:17.510 --> 29:19.295
YOU WERE SUPPOSED
TO CANCEL THAT.

29:19.469 --> 29:21.210
I GUESS I DIDN'T.

29:41.004 --> 29:42.318
HEY!

29:42.492 --> 29:44.146
[GASPS]

29:44.320 --> 29:45.538
YOU SCARED ME.

29:45.712 --> 29:46.844
I'M SORRY.

29:47.018 --> 29:48.889
SO, WHEN ARE WE
GONNA GET STARTED?

29:49.064 --> 29:51.414
DON'T YOU HAVE
SOMEONE ELSE'S LOVE LIFE
TO MEDDLE IN?

29:51.468 --> 29:52.535
MMM...NOPE.

29:52.589 --> 29:54.112
I'M ALL YOURS.

29:54.286 --> 29:56.288
I MEAN, YEAH, SURE,
NORMALLY, WE'VE GOT
40, 50 JOBS,

29:56.462 --> 29:57.942
BUT THE ELDERS THOUGHT
THAT YOU DESERVE

29:58.116 --> 29:59.378
TO HAVE ME
ALL TO YOURSELF.

29:59.552 --> 30:00.727
OH, LUCKY ME!

30:00.901 --> 30:01.902
[CHUCKLES]

30:02.077 --> 30:03.078
UH, YOU KNOW WHAT?

30:03.252 --> 30:04.470
I'M JUST REALLY BUSY
RIGHT NOW,

30:04.644 --> 30:06.429
AND I HAVE BIG ISSUES
TO DEAL WITH, SO...

30:06.463 --> 30:07.496
YEAH, I KNOW.

30:07.560 --> 30:08.779
I KNOW.

30:08.953 --> 30:10.607
AND, UH, YOU'RE
GONNA GET THROUGH THIS.

30:11.743 --> 30:13.523
AND THEN WE'RE
GONNA GET TO WORK.

30:13.697 --> 30:15.568
HAS ANYONE EVER TOLD YOU

30:15.742 --> 30:18.528
THAT YOU ARE
A BIG PAIN IN THE BUTT?

30:18.702 --> 30:20.399
MMM...NO.
I'M A CUPID.

30:20.573 --> 30:23.054
HEY...

30:23.228 --> 30:24.447
GOOD LUCK.

30:36.241 --> 30:37.373
ANYTHING?

30:37.547 --> 30:39.027
WELL, WE THINK
THEY'RE AT MAGIC SCHOOL.

30:39.201 --> 30:41.420
WE FOUND A VERY
HIGH CONCENTRATION
OF ENERGY THERE.

30:41.594 --> 30:43.031
SO THAT MEANS WE HAVE
TO FIGHT THEM THERE?

30:43.205 --> 30:44.597
DOES IT REALLY MATTER
WHERE WE FIGHT THEM?

30:44.771 --> 30:47.687
OK, LET'S GO OVER
THE PLAN AGAIN.

30:47.861 --> 30:49.167
DIVIDE
AND CONQUER, RIGHT?
THAT'S THE PLAN.

30:49.341 --> 30:50.516
SO THAT I CAN
DRAW OUT THEIR POWER...

30:50.690 --> 30:51.996
AND I WILL FREEZE
ONE OF THEM.

30:52.170 --> 30:53.278
THEY ARE
UPPER LEVEL DEMONS,

30:53.302 --> 30:54.651
SO THEY WON'T
FREEZE FOR LONG.

30:54.825 --> 30:56.696
THEY ONLY HAVE
TO STAY FROZEN
LONG ENOUGH

30:56.870 --> 30:58.829
FOR ME TO ORB
THE LAST ONE
INTO POSITION.

30:59.003 --> 31:01.179
YOU KNOW, DO YOU GUYS
THINK I SHOULD GO WITH YOU?

31:01.353 --> 31:03.790
I MEAN, MY PROJECTION POWER
COULD REALLY HELP.

31:03.964 --> 31:06.228
NO, YOU HAVE TO STAY HERE
AND PROTECT YOUR SISTER.

31:06.402 --> 31:09.840
AND YOU ALSO
HAVE TO CALL THE ELDERS
IF WE DON'T COME BACK.

31:11.084 --> 31:12.451
READY?

31:12.625 --> 31:14.932
NOPE, BUT LET'S
DO IT ANYWAY.

31:27.466 --> 31:30.295
WHATEVER HAPPENS,
WE'RE GONNA STICK TOGETHER.

31:30.469 --> 31:32.123
YEAH, RIGHT.
OF COURSE.

31:32.297 --> 31:34.038
THAT'S WHAT SISTERS
ARE FOR, RIGHT?

32:01.848 --> 32:05.939
OK, HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED
TO DIVIDE AND CONQUER THAT?

32:06.114 --> 32:08.899
MAYBE WE SHOULD
TRY TO BLAST 'EM
WHILE THEY'RE DISTRACTED.

32:09.073 --> 32:10.857
I DON'T THINK
IT'LL EVEN FAZE THEM.

32:12.185 --> 32:13.904
I'LL DISTRACT 'EM.

32:15.010 --> 32:16.298
TOO LATE.

32:17.386 --> 32:18.474
OH!

32:19.342 --> 32:20.432
UNH!

32:20.606 --> 32:22.869
Piper: PHOEBE?YEAH? GO!

32:23.882 --> 32:25.089
UHH!

32:25.263 --> 32:26.264
UHH!

32:26.438 --> 32:27.526
I'VE GOT HER!

32:27.700 --> 32:28.962
NO! WE'RE STRONGER
TOGETHER!

32:29.137 --> 32:30.138
HEY!

32:33.793 --> 32:35.143
YOO-HOO!

32:37.458 --> 32:38.798
PAIGE, NOW.

32:38.972 --> 32:40.757
TRIAD GUY.

32:46.021 --> 32:47.111
AH!

32:47.285 --> 32:49.157
NO!

32:51.594 --> 32:52.769
NO!

32:55.685 --> 32:57.991
LOOKING FOR ME?

33:06.705 --> 33:07.876
YOU OK?

33:08.028 --> 33:11.075
YEAH. I CAN'T BELIEVE
WE DID IT.

33:11.249 --> 33:12.685
WELL, 2 OUT OF 3.

33:12.859 --> 33:14.513
WELL, THAT'S ALL
WE NEEDED, RIGHT?

33:14.687 --> 33:15.949
THAT MEANS WE WON.

33:16.123 --> 33:17.821
WELL, IF WE WON,
WHERE'S LEO?

33:17.995 --> 33:18.996
I MEAN,
HE SHOULD BE HERE.

33:20.345 --> 33:21.781
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT WENT WRONG.

33:21.955 --> 33:23.174
MAYBE NOTHING.

33:25.524 --> 33:27.091
MAYBE THERE'S
A BIGGER THREAT OUT THERE.

33:34.489 --> 33:36.056
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

33:36.230 --> 33:39.233
WHAT COULD POSSIBLY BE
A BIGGER THREAT
THAN THE TRIAD?

33:39.407 --> 33:40.495
IS EVERYTHING OK?

33:40.669 --> 33:42.715
WELL, YEAH.
WE GOT THE TRIAD...

33:42.889 --> 33:45.065
BUT WE DO THINK
THAT THERE'S A BIGGER
THREAT OUT THERE.

33:45.239 --> 33:47.328
DID THEY SAY THAT?
NO. THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO.

33:47.502 --> 33:49.548
LEO WOULD BE HERE.

33:49.722 --> 33:51.724
I'M SO SORRY, PIPER.

33:51.898 --> 33:53.900
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE
GONNA GET LEO BACK.

33:57.495 --> 33:59.889
WELL, IN THE MEANTIME,

34:00.063 --> 34:02.457
WE HAVE AN ENGAGEMENT
TO CELEBRATE.

34:02.631 --> 34:07.331
OH. WELL...
I'VE BEEN THINKING
ABOUT THAT, ACTUALLY.

34:07.505 --> 34:09.812
AND I WILL DO IT
ON ONE CONDITION.

34:10.728 --> 34:14.991
IF WE CAN JUST
TURN IT INTO
A WEDDING INSTEAD.

34:25.147 --> 34:26.757
WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED
TO DO NOW?

34:26.931 --> 34:28.498
WE STAY THE COURSE.

34:28.672 --> 34:30.413
BUT HOW
WITHOUT THE OTHERS?

34:30.587 --> 34:31.892
IT WAS NEVER ABOUT US.

34:32.067 --> 34:34.243
IT WAS
ALWAYS ABOUT YOU.

34:37.246 --> 34:39.335
WE'VE TAUGHT YOU
ALL WE KNOW,

34:39.509 --> 34:41.424
SHOWN YOU THE WAY.

34:41.598 --> 34:46.081
NOW YOU MUST GO FORWARD
ALONE TO FULFILL
YOUR DESTINY--

34:46.255 --> 34:49.432
TO UNITE WITH
THE ULTIMATE POWER.

34:53.547 --> 34:55.568
BILLIE.

34:55.742 --> 34:59.181
THIS ISN'T THE COURSE
EITHER ONE OF US
WANTED TO TAKE,

34:59.355 --> 35:01.835
BUT WE DON'T
HAVE A CHOICE NOW.

35:02.009 --> 35:05.187
THE END RESULT
IS ALL THAT MATTERS.

35:05.361 --> 35:09.408
YOU MUST SAVE
YOUR SISTER.

35:20.202 --> 35:21.638
WELL, ABSOLUTELY.

35:21.812 --> 35:23.074
ALTHOUGH, IT IS
KIND OF SHORT NOTICE.

35:23.248 --> 35:26.121
I MIGHT NEED
SOME MAGICAL ASSISTANCE.

35:27.557 --> 35:28.864
LET'S DO IT.

35:31.691 --> 35:32.823
CHRISTY, WHAT'S WRONG?

35:32.997 --> 35:34.090
OH, NOTHING.

35:34.254 --> 35:35.565
I'M FINE.

36:03.984 --> 36:05.203
ARE YOU NERVOUS?

36:06.291 --> 36:07.727
SURPRISINGLY, NO.

36:09.033 --> 36:10.426
YOU'RE NOT READY.

36:12.046 --> 36:15.789
I...AM JUST KIND OF STUNNED
THIS IS HAPPENING.

36:15.963 --> 36:18.139
[LAUGHS]
WELL, BELIEVE IT.

36:18.313 --> 36:21.229
SURE YOU DON'T
WANT TO WEAR MY DRESS?

36:21.403 --> 36:23.884
YEAH. YEAH, I AM.

36:24.058 --> 36:27.235
ALL RIGHT.
LET'S GO CONJURE YOU
A VERY SPECIAL DRESS.

36:34.851 --> 36:36.548
AH-AH-AH-AH!

36:36.722 --> 36:39.116
HOW'S IT GOIN'?

36:39.290 --> 36:41.902
YOU WANT CAKE,
DON'T YOU?

36:42.076 --> 36:43.729
I WANT CAKE, TOO.

36:43.904 --> 36:44.905
GO AHEAD.
YOU CAN HAVE THAT.

36:44.979 --> 36:46.026
LET ME GET MY OWN.

36:46.080 --> 36:47.646
IS IT GOOD?

36:47.821 --> 36:48.952
ALL RIGHT.

36:49.126 --> 36:50.824
HERE. TAKE ANOTHER ONE
REAL QUICK.

36:50.998 --> 36:52.260
QUICK,
BEFORE ANYONE SEES.

36:54.218 --> 36:55.393
YEAH.

36:55.567 --> 36:58.222
ALL RIGHT. LET'S GO
BEFORE ANYONE SEES.

36:58.396 --> 36:59.571
EVERYBODY...

37:00.435 --> 37:01.859
HERE YOU GO.

37:02.638 --> 37:04.466
NOW STAND
RIGHT OVER HERE.

37:04.640 --> 37:06.770
THERE YOU ARE.
HERE YA GO, BUDDY.

37:07.059 --> 37:08.756
SO, HOW YOU FEEL?

37:09.605 --> 37:11.889
LIKE I'M READY
TO TAKE ON THE WORLD.

37:22.987 --> 37:24.337
I WISH LEO WAS HERE.

37:24.511 --> 37:26.034
HE IS.

37:27.679 --> 37:28.993
OH! SORRY.

37:29.168 --> 37:30.430
HOW'S IT GOIN'?

37:30.604 --> 37:32.258
DID SOMEONE
INVITE YOU HERE?

37:32.432 --> 37:34.086
WHAT, ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
I LOVE WEDDINGS.

38:19.218 --> 38:20.741
YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL.

38:20.915 --> 38:23.135
AND YOU LOOK
VERY HANDSOME.

38:23.880 --> 38:25.876
DEARLY BELOVED,

38:26.050 --> 38:28.836
WE ARE GATHERED HERE TODAY
TO JOIN HENRY AND PAIGE

38:29.010 --> 38:30.446
IN HOLY MATRIMONY

38:30.620 --> 38:32.927
IN THE PRESENCE
OF FAMILY AND FRIENDS...

38:33.101 --> 38:36.713
THE UNION OF 2 LIVES
AS ONE

38:36.887 --> 38:38.846
IS A SACRED BOND,

38:39.020 --> 38:41.718
BOTH SOLEMN AND JOYFUL,

38:41.892 --> 38:46.245
EMBRACING ALL THAT YOU ARE
AND ALL THAT YOU WILL BE.

38:46.419 --> 38:48.595
ON THIS DAY
OF YOUR MARRIAGE,

38:48.769 --> 38:51.554
KNOW THAT EVERYTHING
THAT WE LOVE DEEPLY

38:51.728 --> 38:54.253
BECOMES PART OF US.

38:54.427 --> 38:57.734
THE TRICK IS LEARNING
TO RECEIVE THIS LOVE

38:57.908 --> 39:00.650
WITH AS MUCH UNDERSTANDING
AS YOU GIVE IT,

39:00.824 --> 39:04.785
AND KNOWING THIS,
YOU CAN BEGIN A LIFE TOGETHER

39:04.959 --> 39:08.702
WITH AN OPEN MIND
AND HEART.

39:08.876 --> 39:12.053
AND I VOW TO HONOR,

39:12.227 --> 39:13.750
TO LOVE,

39:13.924 --> 39:18.668
AND TO CHERISH YOU
EACH AND EVERY DAY.

39:18.842 --> 39:20.148
THROUGH ALL THE SEASONS
OF LIFE,

39:20.322 --> 39:23.282
THE GOOD TIMES,
THE BAD TIMES,

39:23.456 --> 39:26.154
I VOW TO CHERISH YOU
EACH AND EVERY DAY.

39:50.223 --> 39:51.571
I DO.

39:51.745 --> 39:53.007
I DO.

39:54.443 --> 39:56.576
YOU MAY NOW KISS THE BRIDE.
