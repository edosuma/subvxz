WEBVTT

07:14.916 --> 07:16.583
We're going to capsize.

07:18.083 --> 07:20.000
No one survives a storm like this.

07:20.750 --> 07:22.166
We need to find the captain!

07:24.625 --> 07:27.083
None of us knows how to steer this ship!

07:27.833 --> 07:29.250
This is God's revenge.

07:31.166 --> 07:33.208
If God exists and if He created this,

07:33.291 --> 07:35.041
I swear He must be crazy.

07:35.125 --> 07:37.500
We need to warn the others
in the engine room.

07:39.083 --> 07:40.708
Room. The engine room?

07:41.583 --> 07:43.416
Yes, the crew is still there.

07:43.500 --> 07:45.291
That brute, he will know what to do.

07:45.375 --> 07:46.875
What are you saying?

07:47.625 --> 07:49.541
Are we going to look
for the captain or what?

07:49.625 --> 07:51.041
This is ridiculous!

07:51.125 --> 07:53.416
Can someone tell us what we should do now?

08:01.333 --> 08:02.416
Are you unwell?

08:02.500 --> 08:04.083
Just a little seasick.

08:04.750 --> 08:05.750
That's all.

08:15.125 --> 08:18.041
Let's hurry! We need to find someone
to pilot this steamship!

08:18.125 --> 08:20.166
Are we done talking or what?

08:20.666 --> 08:21.916
Hurry!

08:29.708 --> 08:30.958
Aren't you coming?

13:44.125 --> 13:45.708
May I help you?

13:52.708 --> 13:54.125
Are you lost?

13:57.875 --> 13:59.041
Are you well?

14:00.333 --> 14:01.166
May I help you?

14:01.750 --> 14:02.875
Are you lost?

14:02.958 --> 14:04.208
Are you well?

14:04.291 --> 14:06.458
May I help you?
Are you lost?

14:06.541 --> 14:08.041
Are you well?

14:08.125 --> 14:10.791
May I help you? Are you lost?

14:11.291 --> 14:12.625
Are you well?

15:44.708 --> 15:46.916
Now. We're going to sink.

15:49.875 --> 15:52.375
Of course He wants to punish us.

15:52.458 --> 15:53.708
Your God,

15:54.625 --> 15:56.333
He is not forgiving.

15:56.416 --> 15:58.416
He is crazy and cruel.

15:58.500 --> 16:00.250
This won't do you any good, Father.

16:00.333 --> 16:02.000
In this water, you won't drown.

16:02.083 --> 16:03.583
You'll freeze to death.

16:03.666 --> 16:05.250
You understand? Freeze!

16:08.916 --> 16:09.916
We need to continue.

16:11.125 --> 16:12.250
Keep going.

16:15.416 --> 16:16.791
Tove?

16:17.291 --> 16:19.125
What do you want with these people?

16:19.875 --> 16:21.083
He's not a priest.

16:21.166 --> 16:23.041
And she's clearly a whore.

16:23.750 --> 16:25.041
This is God's choice.

16:26.416 --> 16:28.375
-And I'm staying here.
- Stop it.

16:28.875 --> 16:29.875
Stop.

16:32.083 --> 16:33.916
God will not protect us.

16:34.000 --> 16:36.833
We have not been chosen to follow him.

16:36.916 --> 16:40.083
We both know damn well
that I'm not carrying God's child.

16:40.166 --> 16:42.250
And you're not hearing God's voice.

16:42.333 --> 16:43.875
You are crazy.

16:49.333 --> 16:50.958
Tove. Tove.

16:52.708 --> 16:53.875
Are you coming?

17:05.041 --> 17:05.875
Go.

17:07.750 --> 17:08.750
No.

17:09.833 --> 17:11.583
No. No!

17:12.250 --> 17:13.416
It'll be all right.

17:15.083 --> 17:15.916
No.

17:19.708 --> 17:20.708
Go.

17:22.041 --> 17:23.041
Go.

17:42.000 --> 17:43.958
Let us pray, Anker. Come.

17:44.041 --> 17:45.041
Yes.

17:46.958 --> 17:48.125
Let us pray.

19:32.541 --> 19:33.541
Lucien?

19:34.416 --> 19:36.833
What's going on? What's going on?

19:37.333 --> 19:38.958
I'm fine. I'm fine.

19:45.875 --> 19:46.750
Clémence?

19:48.791 --> 19:49.958
Thank God, you're okay.

19:50.041 --> 19:52.000
Hey. Storm outside.

19:52.083 --> 19:54.416
Waves high like mountains.

19:54.500 --> 19:56.708
It's coming from all sides.
It's everywhere.

19:57.416 --> 19:58.666
Nobody is on the bridge.

19:59.625 --> 20:02.750
The first mate left,
and the captain hasn't returned.

20:03.833 --> 20:06.750
Olek, you have to take the helm.

20:06.833 --> 20:10.208
We have to navigate
straight into the storm. Head on.

20:10.291 --> 20:14.375
If the hull stays
parallel to the waves, we will capsize.

20:14.458 --> 20:18.666
Hey! We have to keep the engines running,
or we don't stand a chance.

20:18.750 --> 20:20.166
Hey. Where are you going?

20:20.250 --> 20:23.208
We have to close the bulkheads,
or water will come in everywhere.

20:24.125 --> 20:25.083
I'll help.

20:25.833 --> 20:27.250
Ling Yi.

20:29.291 --> 20:30.416
I must go to the bridge.

20:33.250 --> 20:35.000
I'll go wherever you go.

25:20.166 --> 25:21.000
Gotcha.

25:59.500 --> 26:01.375
We have to stop the rudder.

26:07.791 --> 26:08.625
Tighter!

34:18.250 --> 34:19.125
Clémence.

34:24.708 --> 34:26.250
Lucien! Lucien!

34:26.833 --> 34:28.458
No! Your medicine!

34:29.166 --> 34:30.833
Lucien, your vial, where is it? Lucien!

34:31.791 --> 34:32.791
Where are his vials?

34:33.958 --> 34:35.791
In a box! In our cabin! Come on!

34:35.875 --> 34:37.375
Help me. Let's carry him.

34:51.083 --> 34:51.916
Well,

34:53.625 --> 34:55.416
I suppose it's up to us now.

36:44.375 --> 36:47.083
Ling Yi! Come.

36:55.166 --> 36:56.708
Come with me.

36:58.791 --> 37:00.041
Mom!

37:03.166 --> 37:04.541
What are you doing?

37:07.583 --> 37:08.958
Fucking hell.

37:17.791 --> 37:19.000
Mom!

37:26.750 --> 37:28.291
What are you doing?

37:29.000 --> 37:30.125
Are you crazy?

37:36.125 --> 37:36.958
Quick!

37:38.083 --> 37:39.416
We have to get back!

37:41.458 --> 37:42.333
Ling Yi!

38:01.583 --> 38:03.666
You won't die. Not today.

38:05.291 --> 38:06.250
I promise.

38:07.791 --> 38:08.791
Come.

38:11.833 --> 38:13.083
Olek!

38:22.791 --> 38:24.125
No!

38:26.625 --> 38:28.083
Olek!

38:31.625 --> 38:33.000
Olek!

38:46.250 --> 38:47.250
Hey!

39:49.041 --> 39:50.041
Ángel!

39:52.125 --> 39:53.166
Ángel!

39:56.833 --> 39:59.291
No! No! No! This isn't happening. No!

39:59.375 --> 40:05.250
Someone. Help me, please! Someone!

40:07.083 --> 40:07.916
Wait.

40:09.583 --> 40:12.041
Ángel. Ángel. Ángel.

40:12.125 --> 40:13.125
My love.

40:16.666 --> 40:21.916
I never understood
why you fell in love with someone like me.

40:24.291 --> 40:29.583
You are the gentlest,
most loyal man I've ever met.

40:30.750 --> 40:32.000
And you were right.

40:36.000 --> 40:37.625
You're better off without me.

40:38.708 --> 40:39.625
No.

40:40.291 --> 40:44.791
No. Don't leave me. No, my love.

40:47.333 --> 40:48.208
I'm scared.

40:48.291 --> 40:49.291
No. No. No.

41:36.041 --> 41:37.250
Iben, my love.

41:37.333 --> 41:38.916
We can't stay here. Come.

41:41.708 --> 41:43.125
Don't worry about me.

41:43.916 --> 41:47.208
If this is what He wants for me,
who am I to deny His wish?

41:47.291 --> 41:49.583
You think He wants you to die?

41:49.666 --> 41:51.416
God wants you to die?

41:52.166 --> 41:56.000
It's what you want! It's what you want!

41:56.666 --> 41:58.083
Iben, wake up.

41:58.958 --> 42:01.250
I know His true path for us.

42:02.375 --> 42:03.583
For all of us.

42:08.250 --> 42:09.541
It won't close!

42:09.625 --> 42:12.291
Come! We have to close the next one along.

42:18.916 --> 42:21.583
There's no handle.
Why isn't there a handle?

42:21.666 --> 42:24.541
- What do we do?
- Dammit.

42:25.166 --> 42:26.000
No.

42:30.250 --> 42:31.708
Promise you'll stay alive.

42:36.458 --> 42:37.583
What are you doing?

42:38.208 --> 42:39.458
No!

42:40.416 --> 42:41.458
No!

42:42.666 --> 42:44.083
No! Open up!

42:46.083 --> 42:47.708
It will be all right.

42:49.541 --> 42:51.208
I am not going to leave you.

42:52.333 --> 42:53.708
I'll never leave you.

43:06.458 --> 43:08.708
Stop! No!
