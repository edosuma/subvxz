00:00.934 --> 00:03.604
My name is Earl.

00:04.872 --> 00:07.508
Bye, Mr. and Mrs. Abernathy.

00:07.575 --> 00:10.644
I hope the retirement
trailer park community
is everything you saved for.

00:10.711 --> 00:14.915
Oh, it will be.
Golden Endings is
supposed to be lovely.

00:14.982 --> 00:17.385
They say there's
a bunny living there.

00:18.986 --> 00:22.156
[ Earl Narrating ]
We hadn't seen Mrs. Abernathy
in six months,

00:22.223 --> 00:27.528
and I thought
she was already dead,
so I was happy to see her alive.

00:27.595 --> 00:29.263
They're gonna die soon,
aren't they, Earl?

00:29.330 --> 00:31.232
At least they'll
be near a bunny.

00:31.299 --> 00:33.967
[ Earl Narrating ]
I was also happy to see her
leave, 'cause that allowed me...

00:34.034 --> 00:36.036
to do number 52 on my list--

00:36.104 --> 00:38.372
dig up and return
the buried treasure.

00:38.439 --> 00:40.708
It all started back
when me and Joy were married.

00:40.774 --> 00:43.511
Some families all get
together and play Scrabble.

00:43.577 --> 00:46.247
But since we couldn't spell,
we would just go stealin'.

00:46.314 --> 00:49.517
We steal enough stuff tonight,
I'm gettin' a motorcycle.
No, you're not.

00:49.583 --> 00:51.852
Yeah, I am.
You're not gettin'
a motorcycle, dummy.

00:51.919 --> 00:54.422
You broke your collarbone
tryin' to drive the kids'
Big Wheel.

00:54.488 --> 00:58.192
No one ever talks about
how I made it one mile down
the highway on that Big Wheel.

00:58.259 --> 01:00.594
They only talk
about the collarbone.

01:00.661 --> 01:02.596
[ Earl Narrating ]
We were bored of robbin'
our usual places,

01:02.663 --> 01:05.199
like the hardware store
or my dad's house,

01:05.266 --> 01:07.668
so we chose a place
we'd never been before:

01:07.735 --> 01:10.538
The library.
[ Joy ]
Come on. Let's get to stealin'.

01:11.705 --> 01:13.707
Can I stay back here
and be lookout?
Why?

01:13.774 --> 01:17.211
I can't touch books.
You know how afraid
I am of paper cuts.

01:17.278 --> 01:19.280
They might as well
make books out of knives.

01:19.347 --> 01:22.183
When I start cryin',
Joy's gonna make fun of me.

01:22.250 --> 01:24.585
You know, like how she does
because I can't snap.

01:24.652 --> 01:27.755
Are you comin' or not?
Randy's gonna stay here
and be our lookout.

01:27.821 --> 01:33.026
Great. Hey, if you see
somebody comin', just snap.
[ Chuckling ]

01:33.093 --> 01:36.564
Seriously, though,
you need to give us
a little whistle.

01:39.066 --> 01:42.536
[ Faint Whistling ]

01:44.905 --> 01:47.141
[ Spits ]
Damn.

01:47.208 --> 01:50.244
[ Earl Narrating ]
In Camden County,
the library was also the museum,

01:50.311 --> 01:52.480
so you could actually
learn stuff there,

01:52.546 --> 01:54.582
instead of just readin' books.

01:54.648 --> 01:57.585
I learned that day the official
bird of Camden was the peacock.

01:57.651 --> 01:59.953
And since it wasn't
nailed down, I took it.

02:00.020 --> 02:02.055
Randy, peacock!

02:02.122 --> 02:05.693
Oh, snap!
Check it out.

02:05.759 --> 02:08.529
Fancy forks and spoons.

02:08.596 --> 02:10.831
Wow, this one's got
holes rotted through it.

02:10.898 --> 02:12.666
Nice.
All cereal, no milk.

02:15.836 --> 02:17.838
Wait!

02:17.905 --> 02:21.409
Now that we got fancy
silverware, I want us to eat
like civilized human beings.

02:21.475 --> 02:24.612
- Join hands.
- Are we gonna dance?

02:24.678 --> 02:27.381
No, dummy.
We're gonna say grace.

02:27.448 --> 02:31.385
Earl, deliver our blessing.

02:31.452 --> 02:34.822
[ Clears Throat ]
Uh, Lord,

02:34.888 --> 02:40.661
uh, thank you for allowing us
to steal such nice silverware.

02:40.728 --> 02:42.730
Uh, we promise
to take good care of it...

02:42.796 --> 02:45.032
as we use it to eat
all your creatures.

02:45.098 --> 02:48.101
- [ All ] Amen.
- [ Man On TV ]
The librarian is on the scene.

02:48.168 --> 02:51.038
[ Gasps ]
Check it out!
Library's on TV.

02:51.104 --> 02:55.709
They broke the beak
clean off of Zucker,
our peacock.

02:55.776 --> 02:59.313
Plus, they stole
the silverware that
belonged to Philip C. Graber.

02:59.380 --> 03:02.450
He was our famous
Civil War general.

03:02.516 --> 03:04.818
The silverware
is worth $2,000.

03:04.885 --> 03:07.087
[ Gasps ]
We're rich!

03:07.154 --> 03:10.558
And it's prominently
marked with a "C."
The police have been alerted.

03:10.624 --> 03:13.093
"C" for "silverware."
That's smart.

03:13.160 --> 03:15.596
[ Earl Narrating ]
So we took the silverware
to Jasper to sell it,

03:15.663 --> 03:18.065
but he had seen that
old lady on the news too.

03:18.131 --> 03:21.235
Sorry. It's too hot.
And I can't give it
to my silver guy...

03:21.302 --> 03:23.103
'cause he got busted
meltin' down a menorah.

03:23.170 --> 03:26.640
They said it was a hate crime,
but he just hated bein' poor.

03:28.175 --> 03:30.444
[ Earl Narrating ]
Since the silverware
was too hot for Jasper,

03:30.511 --> 03:33.347
the plan was to sit
on it until things cooled off.

03:33.414 --> 03:36.183
Randy dug the hole too big
'cause he got confused...

03:36.250 --> 03:38.252
and thought
we were burying Jasper.

03:38.319 --> 03:42.189
But all the next day,
I thought about
gettin' a motorcycle.

03:42.256 --> 03:45.259
If those fat twins
from the world records
book could each have one,

03:45.326 --> 03:47.261
I didn't see why I couldn't.

03:47.328 --> 03:49.196
So I came up with a plan.

03:49.263 --> 03:51.031
Gotta poop.

03:51.098 --> 03:54.001
I wrote a ransom note
to the library,
askin' for $2,000,

03:54.067 --> 03:56.203
or I'd kill their silverware.

03:56.270 --> 03:58.171
And to make 'em think
I was a real sicko,

03:58.238 --> 04:01.675
I even cut a nipple
out of a nudie magazine
and used it as a period.

04:01.742 --> 04:04.978
[ Knocking ]
[ Joy ] Earl, you've been
in there 20 minutes.

04:05.045 --> 04:08.749
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know.
I thought I was done,
and then round two.

04:08.816 --> 04:10.751
I'm just as surprised
as you are.

04:10.818 --> 04:13.587
Just turn the damned fan on.
Okay.

04:15.789 --> 04:18.258
Damn it.

04:18.326 --> 04:20.694
[ Earl Narrating ]
I figured my ransom note
would work a lot better...

04:20.761 --> 04:23.464
if I could prove
I had the hostage.

04:23.531 --> 04:26.367
Luckily, I had stolen
a camera the week before.

04:26.434 --> 04:28.336
So I took a picture
of the hostage,

04:28.402 --> 04:30.471
and another one of
two crickets humpin',

04:30.538 --> 04:33.874
and then reburied
the silverware.
[ Shoveling ]

04:33.941 --> 04:37.177
Fortunately for me,
there was an unwritten rule
at the trailer park.

04:37.244 --> 04:42.483
If you see someone
burying somethin' at night,
you don't ask questions.

04:42.550 --> 04:46.454
Lookin' back, I'm surprised
Joy didn't figure out
I was up to somethin'.

04:46.520 --> 04:48.956
Mostly 'cause
I'm a terrible liar.

04:49.022 --> 04:51.359
Why are you so dirty?

04:51.425 --> 04:53.327
- Horse.
- Huh?

04:53.394 --> 04:57.698
Rode a horse.
Horses are dirty.
I got dirty while ridin' it.

04:57.765 --> 05:01.769
What's the big deal?
You don't get to tell me when
I ride a horse and when I don't.

05:01.835 --> 05:04.505
Well, you can go ride
on the couch tonight, Pigpen.

05:04.572 --> 05:07.808
[ Earl Narrating ] I was glad
Joy kicked me out. If I had
stayed in there any longer,

05:07.875 --> 05:10.544
I was afraid the subject
of the silverware would come up,

05:10.611 --> 05:12.780
and that was the last thing
I wanted to talk about.

05:14.382 --> 05:17.651
Earl, listen, I got an idea
about what we can do
with the fancy forks.

05:17.718 --> 05:19.687
Let me guess, Randy.
A fork robot?

05:19.753 --> 05:23.757
No-- Do you know how
to make a fork robot?

05:23.824 --> 05:26.059
And I'm lockin' this door.
I don't want you
sneakin' back in...

05:26.126 --> 05:29.930
and tryin' to put
your dirty hands all over me.

05:29.997 --> 05:32.065
Women.

05:32.132 --> 05:34.001
They sure are loud,
huh, Earl?

05:34.067 --> 05:37.571
Anyway, about the fancy forks--
Enough about the forks.
I need some air.

05:42.209 --> 05:44.712
[ Earl Narrating ]
I dropped off my ransom
note that night...

05:44.778 --> 05:46.847
and Dotty found it
the next morning.

05:49.683 --> 05:54.755
It scared the pee-pee
out of her, which at her age
wasn't a hard thing to do.

05:54.822 --> 05:57.758
So all I had to do was wait
for Dotty to make the drop.

05:57.825 --> 06:00.628
I told her to put two grand
in a Chubby's Barbecue bag...

06:00.694 --> 06:03.731
and leave it in the trash can
outside the old train station.

06:04.832 --> 06:07.801
[ Coughing ]

06:07.868 --> 06:10.237
I had a close call
when Joy drove by,

06:10.303 --> 06:13.607
but that smoker's cough
was better than a cowbell
around her neck.

06:15.375 --> 06:20.313
Dotty was right on time,
as old people and
librarians tend to be.

06:20.380 --> 06:23.851
Lucky for me, she was both.

06:23.917 --> 06:27.220
I was a smart enough criminal
not to go for the money
right away,

06:27.287 --> 06:29.089
just in case
anyone was watchin'.

06:31.525 --> 06:36.096
I forgot to ask Randy what
he was doin' following that guy
with the tight striped pants.

06:43.336 --> 06:46.474
It was at that point
I decided to forget
about the whole scheme.

- [ Siren Blaring ]
- And don't worry, that
homeless guy is on my list.

06:50.944 --> 06:55.983
Especially since
I've seen him around town,
and he's still blue.

06:56.049 --> 07:00.087
And lookin' back on it now,
I realize karma must not
have liked what I did,

07:00.153 --> 07:03.190
'cause it tried to kill me
with an explodin' bush.

07:05.392 --> 07:07.227
Now that Joy's neighbors
had moved away,

07:07.294 --> 07:10.030
I could finally dig up
the silverware and return it
to the library.

07:10.097 --> 07:12.132
There was only one problem.

07:12.199 --> 07:15.703
I don't understand, Randy.
I could swear this is where
we buried the silverware.

07:15.769 --> 07:18.438
[ Randy Narrating ]
There was a reason Earl
couldn't find that silverware,

07:18.506 --> 07:20.508
and I knew what it was.

07:20.574 --> 07:23.744
You know the kind of guy
who likes hangin' out with
his brother watchin' cartoons,

07:23.811 --> 07:25.879
and also likes to touch
things with his tongue?

07:25.946 --> 07:28.248
Well, that's me.
I'm also the kind of guy...

07:28.315 --> 07:30.618
who likes hangin' out
with his brother and
watchin' cartoons.

07:46.900 --> 07:49.637
Maybe someone from China dug
and got it from the other end.

07:49.703 --> 07:52.740
I just think maybe
I'm off by a few feet.

07:52.806 --> 07:56.243
[ Randy Narrating ]
How did I know Earl wasn't
gonna find that silverware?

07:56.309 --> 07:58.579
I knew because I took it.

07:58.646 --> 08:02.349
You're not gettin' a motorcycle.
You broke your collarbone tryin'
to drive the kids' Big Wheel.

08:02.415 --> 08:05.018
[ Randy Narrating ]
I was bummed that Joy wouldn't
let Earl get a motorcycle,

08:05.085 --> 08:07.154
'cause I always wanted
to ride in a sidecar.

08:07.220 --> 08:09.890
But I was even more bummed
that Earl and Joy were fightin',

08:09.957 --> 08:12.092
because when they fight,
it always gives me a tummy ache.

08:13.460 --> 08:15.729
But after we stole
some fancy silverware
from the library,

08:15.796 --> 08:17.865
everyone started
bein' happy again.

There was nothin' better than
when everyone was gettin' along.

08:24.104 --> 08:26.239
Except for when
I was starin' at a spoon,

08:26.306 --> 08:29.843
and a little tiny upside-down
Randy with a crazy forehead
was starin' back.

08:31.612 --> 08:35.683
But it didn't last.
We couldn't sell the silverware
because it was too famous.

08:35.749 --> 08:41.021
I guess we would've had the same
problem if we stole that Webster
kid from Diff'rent Strokes.

08:41.088 --> 08:44.224
We went from
everybody gettin' along
to nobody talkin',

08:44.291 --> 08:46.960

started to hurtin' again.

- I gotta poop.
- I guess Earl's did too.

08:50.430 --> 08:53.934
Whenever I was alone
with Joy, it made me nervous.
And when I get nervous--

08:54.001 --> 08:57.237
I gotta pee.

08:57.304 --> 09:02.710
After I got away from Joy,

You mean,
if I only had two grand,

if it's stolen.

We made plans to meet
later that night.

10:12.946 --> 10:15.282
I couldn't wait to get home
to tell Earl how I met a man...

who sounded like Count Chocula
and looked like Franken Berry.

10:17.985 --> 10:21.054
But the important thing was,
he was gonna make us rich.

I knew somethin' was wrong
with Earl, because I was pretty
sure there was air in here, too.

11:26.987 --> 11:31.491
This is good.
I worried you no show.
I leave town soon.

11:31.558 --> 11:33.727
Then how am I gonna
get my money?

11:33.794 --> 11:36.496
Oh, right.

11:36.563 --> 11:42.602
Tomorrow,
you meet my associate
at, uh, old train station.

11:42.669 --> 11:45.005
How will I know it's him?

11:45.072 --> 11:50.243
Hmm. Just ask for person
who has "the stuff."

11:50.310 --> 11:52.179
Shh.

11:54.214 --> 11:56.183
[ Randy Narrating ]
So the next morning,

11:56.249 --> 11:58.418
I went to the old train
station to get the money.

12:02.722 --> 12:04.792
Do you have the stuff?

12:06.526 --> 12:09.797
[ Coughing ]

12:11.264 --> 12:13.500
Do you have the stuff?
Get away from me.

12:13.566 --> 12:18.338
I'm just here to do what
the note said, even though
the spelling was atrocious.

12:26.179 --> 12:28.615
Spare some change?
Sorry.

12:28.681 --> 12:32.352
But if you're hungry, I just saw
a lady throw away a Chubby's
bag that looked pretty full.

12:32.419 --> 12:34.287
Thanks, buddy.

12:39.827 --> 12:41.661
Do you have the stuff?
Pardon?

12:41.728 --> 12:45.665
If you have
the stuff, I want it.
Can you give it to me?

12:45.732 --> 12:50.503
You have the stuff, don't you?
Oh, I have got
the stuff, kitten.

12:50.570 --> 12:55.508
Great. Where should we do it?
Well, there's a little
gazebo right over there.

12:55.575 --> 12:58.045
Come on.

13:02.916 --> 13:05.152
[ Man ]
Police! Freeze!

13:05.218 --> 13:08.488
[ Man #2 ]
Don't move!

13:08.555 --> 13:11.558
[ Randy Narrating ]
The stuff he had was the same
as the stuff I already had,

13:11.624 --> 13:13.493
so I got the hell out of there.

13:19.399 --> 13:23.136
The point is,
I never got the money.

13:23.203 --> 13:25.939
And that's how I knew Earl
wouldn't find the silverware.

13:26.006 --> 13:29.809
It's not here, Randy. I'm sure
we buried the silverware
10 paces from the tree.

13:29.877 --> 13:33.480
Well, we were
drinkin' that night.
Did you try 10 drunk paces?

13:33.546 --> 13:36.083
I'll give it a shot.

13:44.657 --> 13:47.027
[ Joy Narrating ]
He might be off
by a couple of feet,

13:47.094 --> 13:50.263
but when he does find that box,
he won't like what's inside.

13:50.330 --> 13:52.265
Idiot.

13:52.332 --> 13:55.635
You know the kind of woman
who could've been
the next Faith Hill,

13:55.702 --> 13:58.906
but somewhere along the way
discovered peach daiquiris,
put her diaphragm in wrong,

13:58.972 --> 14:02.509
and wound up smack dab
in the middle of trailer hell,
raisin' two kids?

14:02.575 --> 14:06.079
Yet she still manages
to look hot, and you could
bounce a quarter off her butt,

14:06.146 --> 14:09.116
'cause you gotta
take care of yourself,
I mean, come on.

14:09.182 --> 14:12.619
Anyway, that's me.
My name is Joy.

14:16.689 --> 14:19.492
My name is Joy.

14:19.559 --> 14:22.529
There were two reasons
I knew Earl wouldn't find
what he was lookin' for.

14:22.595 --> 14:26.366
One, he was wasted.
And two, I got to it first.

14:28.468 --> 14:31.371
We stole some silverware
from the library,
but it was too hot to sell,

14:31.438 --> 14:34.574
so we agreed to let it sit
in the dirt for a few years.

14:36.643 --> 14:40.313
- I gotta poop.
- [ Joy ] But then people
started actin' real weird.

14:40.380 --> 14:42.349
Earl never reads
in the bathroom.

14:42.415 --> 14:45.218
He uses that time
to make the cockroaches race.

14:45.285 --> 14:47.020
Then Randy started
actin' even weirder.

14:47.087 --> 14:49.656
You know, guilty-like,
but tryin' to hide it,

14:49.722 --> 14:55.595
- like that face O.J. made when
he was puttin' on that glove.
- I gotta pee.

14:55.662 --> 14:58.698
Those two dummies were
definitely up to somethin'
behind my back,

14:58.765 --> 15:00.667
and I didn't like it.

15:00.733 --> 15:03.937
And I'm lockin' this door.
I don't want you
sneakin' back in...

15:04.004 --> 15:07.740
and tryin' to put your
dirty hands all over me.

15:07.807 --> 15:10.243
[ Joy Narrating ]
I was gonna make sure I stole
that stolen silverware...

15:10.310 --> 15:12.379
from them before
they stole it from me.

15:12.445 --> 15:15.515
I took the good stuff
and replaced it with
some crap from home.

15:15.582 --> 15:19.286
That way, if those two dummies
tried to sell it behind my back,
they'd be screwed.

15:19.352 --> 15:21.188
[ Rustling ]

15:30.463 --> 15:32.665
[ Door Shuts ]

15:34.667 --> 15:37.037

15:41.041 --> 15:44.244
[ Chuckles ]
Dumb-ass.

15:44.311 --> 15:47.614
[ Joy Narrating ]
Since I couldn't sell the stuff
as is, I decided to melt it.

15:47.680 --> 15:51.884
I figured turnin' silver
into silverware was probably
the hard part,

15:51.951 --> 15:56.456
so turnin' the silverware
back into silver that I could
sell was gonna be easy.

15:56.523 --> 15:58.758
But I was wrong.

15:58.825 --> 16:01.928
- What do you mean,
you can't take it?
- Joy, this town is crawlin'...

16:01.995 --> 16:04.631
with those Civil War
reenactment guys
tryin' to find this stuff,

16:04.697 --> 16:08.701
and the ones from the South
would love nothin' better
than to find it with me.

16:08.768 --> 16:11.638
[ Joy Narrating ]
I was upset Jasper
wouldn't take the silverware.

16:11.704 --> 16:15.975
But I can only stay upset
for so long when my girl
Faith's on the radio.

16:16.043 --> 16:18.645
** [ Country ]

16:18.711 --> 16:21.714
* Caught up in the touch
Slow and steady rush *

16:21.781 --> 16:24.051
* Baby, isn't that the way *

16:24.117 --> 16:27.720
* That love's supposed to be *

16:39.966 --> 16:42.702
[ Coughing ]

16:57.717 --> 17:00.453
[ Joy Narrating ]
So I was forced
to rebury the silverware,

17:00.520 --> 17:04.091
but in a different spot,
where Earl and Randy
would never find it.

17:04.157 --> 17:07.094
It was a special place,
because it was the exact spot
I was standing...

17:07.160 --> 17:09.729
when Earl Junior
was conceived.

17:11.864 --> 17:16.569
I can't wait to see their faces
when they dig up that box
and see what's inside.

17:16.636 --> 17:18.438

17:18.505 --> 17:23.310
What's so funny, baby? Did that
lady put her big granny panties
on the clothesline again?

17:23.376 --> 17:25.312
We should go over
and get in them together,

17:25.378 --> 17:28.014
and take a picture
for our Christmas card.

17:28.081 --> 17:31.618
Earl thinks he's gonna
find some silverware
we stole a while back.

17:31.684 --> 17:35.788
But I stole it out
from under him and hid it
by the big rock out back.

17:35.855 --> 17:39.892
Oh, yeah?
Yeah. I tried meltin' it down,
so it looks all black and gross,

17:39.959 --> 17:42.295
but underneath,
it's pure silver.

17:42.362 --> 17:44.497
It's kinda like my safety net.
I like knowin' it's there,

17:44.564 --> 17:48.968
just in case I ever need to
jump bail and head for Mexico,
or I see a pair of shoes I like.

17:49.035 --> 17:51.271
[ Darnell Narrating ]
I didn't have the nerve
to tell Joy...

17:51.338 --> 17:53.840
that silver wasn't
where she thought it was.

17:53.906 --> 17:58.678
You know the kind of guy
who graduated college at 14,
is a virtuoso cellist,

17:58.745 --> 18:03.049
and can identify
254 varieties of cheese
in a blind taste test,

18:03.116 --> 18:06.519
but can't reveal
any of that because he's in
the Witness Protection Program?

18:06.586 --> 18:09.756
Well, that's me.
Don't tell anyone
I told you this.

18:09.822 --> 18:12.225
My name is--

18:12.292 --> 18:15.862
Well, you better
just call me Crabman.

18:15.928 --> 18:20.567
When Mr. Fish died,
I thought I'd bury him
in a place he would like.

18:20.633 --> 18:23.270
It was a special place,
where I took Joy
on our first date.

18:23.336 --> 18:26.506
I'm sorry
I thought the pepper
was the fish food.

18:26.573 --> 18:28.808
I know that couldn't
have been an easy way to go.

18:28.875 --> 18:32.912
But if it's any consolation,
I put the fish food on my eggs.

18:32.979 --> 18:35.715
It didn't kill me,
though. Sorry.

18:45.292 --> 18:49.929
It looked like it was from
some ancient civilization,
possibly Paleolithic,

18:49.996 --> 18:53.466
though it appeared
to have been struck
with a cylindrical object...

18:53.533 --> 18:55.402
that wouldn't
have been invented
until the Bronze Age.

18:55.468 --> 18:57.904
So I decided to take it
down to the museum.

18:57.970 --> 19:00.139
Thought I'd bring 'em in here,
since you're the expert.

19:00.207 --> 19:02.209
I'm pretty sure
it's just trash.

19:03.410 --> 19:08.014
But we still have some room
in our display case.

19:08.080 --> 19:11.551

Earl wasn't the only one
who would never find the silver.

That's what they get
for tryin' to screw with me.

19:18.691 --> 19:21.428

And I sure wasn't gonna be
the one to tell her.

19:21.494 --> 19:24.697

Oh, honey, we don't
sell weed here anymore.

of mine. I wanted to make
an actual cash donation.

the library a better place.

19:50.423 --> 19:53.926

I'll get the shoe box.

19:55.295 --> 19:57.163
Hey, Earl,
check it out.

They found something
that belonged to cavemen
right here in Camden.

I realized why I couldn't
find the buried treasure.
