11:59.370 --> 12:02.634
AS THE SANCTUARY
FOR THE CEREMONIAL PASSING
OF THE STAFF.

12:02.809 --> 12:04.811
IT HAS BEEN
MY FAMILY'S HONOR

12:04.985 --> 12:06.334
TO FIND A PLACE
FOR ITS EXISTENCE

12:06.508 --> 12:08.249
EACH AND EVERY YEAR.

12:08.423 --> 12:11.121
SO, IT'S JUST MY LUCK
THAT A DEMON TRIES TO
TAKE IT THIS YEAR?

12:11.295 --> 12:12.557
NOT JUST THIS YEAR.

12:12.732 --> 12:13.863
HE'S BEEN TRYING
FOR MANY YEARS

12:14.037 --> 12:16.387
WHEN IT IS VULNERABLE,
AS IT IS NOW.

12:16.561 --> 12:19.434
THAT IS WHY I SENT OUT
THE CALL FOR HELP,

12:19.608 --> 12:21.218
AND THAT IS WHY YOU CAME.

12:21.392 --> 12:23.351
NO, REALLY, SERIOUSLY,

12:23.525 --> 12:25.832
I WAS LOOKING FOR SOMETHING
TOTALLY DIFFERENT.

12:26.006 --> 12:28.095
YOU MUST BE A BUFFALO.

12:28.269 --> 12:30.140
EXCUSE ME?

12:30.314 --> 12:33.317
I THINK HE'S TALKING
ABOUT YOUR SIGN.

12:33.491 --> 12:34.971
HANG ON A SECOND.

12:35.145 --> 12:36.407
SHE GETS A TIGER,
AND I'M SOME STINKING
BUFFALO?

12:36.581 --> 12:38.192
IF YOU KNOW THE ZODIACS,

12:38.366 --> 12:41.499
YOU KNOW WE DO NOT CHOOSE
WHO WE ARE BORN TO.

12:41.673 --> 12:43.632
EACH INFLUENCES US
WITH DIFFERENT GIFTS

12:43.806 --> 12:46.200
TO KEEP
THE ETERNAL CYCLE ALIVE.

12:46.374 --> 12:49.856
BUT IF A DEMON
STEALS THE STAFF
BEFORE IT IS PASSED,

12:50.030 --> 12:52.162
THEN THE CYCLE ENDS.

12:52.336 --> 12:54.556
AND IT WON'T BE THE ZODIACS
WHO INFLUENCE,

12:54.730 --> 12:56.906
BUT EVIL INSTEAD.

12:57.080 --> 13:00.214
NOT A WORLD YOUR HUSBAND
WOULD WANT TO BE SAVED FOR,
I TRUST.

13:01.911 --> 13:03.913
ALL RIGHT.
WHAT WOULD YOU
LIKE US TO DO?

13:04.087 --> 13:07.134
PROTECT THE STAFF
UNTIL IT IS PASSED
TO THE NEW ZODIAC.

13:07.308 --> 13:09.310
BUT YOU MUST BE
OF CLEAR MIND

13:09.484 --> 13:12.313
SO AS NOT TO
UNDULY INFLUENCE
THOSE AROUND YOU

13:12.487 --> 13:13.357
WITH YOUR PERSONALITY.

13:13.531 --> 13:15.272
[SCOFFS]

13:15.446 --> 13:18.798
I'M SORRY.
I'M JUST IMAGINING
A LOT OF OBSESSING.

13:18.972 --> 13:20.538
THAT'S CUTE.
THAT'S VERY CUTE.

13:20.712 --> 13:22.236
YOU MUST LEAVE NOW
BEFORE THEY COME BACK.

13:22.410 --> 13:24.934
USE ALL OF YOUR POWER
TO PROTECT IT
IF YOU HAVE TO.

13:25.108 --> 13:27.023
MAYBE YOU SHOULD CALL
PAIGE AND PHOEBE.

13:27.197 --> 13:28.633
YOU BETTER BELIEVE IT.

13:28.808 --> 13:30.505
DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT THIS DEMON?

13:30.679 --> 13:33.595
NO, BUT I HAVE KEPT A RECORD
OF HIS PAST ATTACKS.

13:33.769 --> 13:34.944
I COULD TAKE A LOOK
AT THEM.

13:35.118 --> 13:37.033
MAYBE I'LL FIGURE
SOMETHING OUT.

13:37.207 --> 13:39.340
PERHAPS YOU'LL FIND OUT
SOMETHING ABOUT YOURSELF
ALONG THE WAY, BILLIE.

13:39.514 --> 13:41.168
HOW DO YOU KNOW
MY NAME?

13:41.342 --> 13:43.083
THIS IS A MAGICAL PLACE,

13:43.257 --> 13:46.086
ONE WHERE QUESTIONS
WILL HAVE ANSWERS,

13:46.260 --> 13:47.696
IF YOU'RE OPEN TO IT.

13:47.870 --> 13:49.263
YOU'LL SEE.

13:53.006 --> 13:55.530
SO, WHEN DOES
THIS CEREMONY BEGIN?

13:55.704 --> 13:56.618
AT MIDNIGHT.

13:59.099 --> 14:00.448
NATURALLY.

14:07.368 --> 14:08.804
THE STAFF IS LOST.

14:08.978 --> 14:11.372
WE HAVE NO CHOICE
BUT TO WAIT ANOTHER YEAR.

14:11.546 --> 14:12.721
WE'RE NOT WAITING.

14:14.114 --> 14:14.941
WHY SHOULD WE?

14:15.115 --> 14:16.072
BECAUSE THE WITCHES--

14:16.246 --> 14:17.900
MERELY DELAYED
THE INEVITABLE.

14:18.074 --> 14:21.686
AFTER ALL,
PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE.

14:21.861 --> 14:24.646
UNPRECEDENTED PROGRESS.

14:24.820 --> 14:28.824
A ZODIAC IS DEAD,
WHICH MEANS THEY AS A WHOLE
ARE WEAKENED.

14:28.998 --> 14:30.695
AND THE STAFF
IS OUT OF SACRED HANDS

14:30.870 --> 14:31.958
FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER.

14:32.132 --> 14:33.960
STILL, NOW THEY KNOW
WE'RE COMING.

14:34.134 --> 14:36.440
THEY ALWAYS KNOW
WE'RE COMING.

14:36.614 --> 14:40.009
YOU UNDERESTIMATED LO PAN.
DO NOT UNDERESTIMATE ME.

14:40.183 --> 14:43.012
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT,

14:43.186 --> 14:47.147
THE SERVANT
WON'T KEEP THE STAFF
IN THE GARDEN NOW,

14:47.321 --> 14:48.539
NOT UNTIL THE HAND-OFF.

14:48.713 --> 14:50.324
WE'LL NEVER
FIND IT IN TIME.

14:50.498 --> 14:51.499
WE WON'T HAVE TO.

14:51.673 --> 14:54.632
THE ZODIACS
WILL FIND IT FOR US.

14:54.806 --> 14:56.504
WE'LL LET IT BE KNOWN
WHAT'S HAPPENED,

14:56.678 --> 14:58.332
WHAT LO PAN'S DONE.

14:58.506 --> 15:01.291
THEY'LL COME
OUT OF HIDING

15:01.465 --> 15:03.163
TO GET
THEIR PRECIOUS STAFF BACK.

15:03.337 --> 15:05.034
TRUST ME.

15:05.208 --> 15:07.819
SO THEN ALL WE HAVE TO
DO IS TRACK THEM.

15:07.994 --> 15:10.344
SEE?

15:10.518 --> 15:12.607
PROGRESS.

15:13.738 --> 15:16.654
ALL RIGHT, HENRY,
I HAVE TO SAY

15:16.828 --> 15:18.091
I'VE BEEN DOING
SOME THINKING.

15:18.265 --> 15:20.310
UH-OH. ABOUT WHAT?

15:20.484 --> 15:22.095
WELL, HERE'S THE DEAL.

15:22.269 --> 15:23.748
I HAVE A PLAN,
YOU KNOW, FOR US.

15:23.923 --> 15:25.620
I THOUGHT WE WERE DOING
PRETTY WELL.

15:25.794 --> 15:28.362
YEAH, DEFINITELY,
EXCEPT FOR, YOU KNOW,

15:28.536 --> 15:30.668
WHEN THE "M" WORD
KIND OF COMES UP,

15:30.842 --> 15:32.627
THINGS START GETTING
A LITTLE BIT--

15:32.801 --> 15:33.628
WEIRD.

15:33.802 --> 15:35.412
YEAH, EXACTLY.

15:35.586 --> 15:37.980
BUT EVERYTHING ELSE
IS OBVIOUSLY GOING WELL.

15:38.154 --> 15:41.375
YOU'RE EVEN FINISHING
MY SENTENCES.

15:41.549 --> 15:42.506
BUT, UM...

15:43.768 --> 15:46.336
AH! OK,
STEP INTO MY OFFICE.

15:46.510 --> 15:47.424
HAVE A SEAT.

15:47.598 --> 15:48.730
ON THIS?

15:48.904 --> 15:52.038
YES. YOU CAN FIT.
I'M PRETTY SURE.

15:52.212 --> 15:53.604
BARELY.

15:53.778 --> 15:57.565
OK.
STAY WITH ME HERE.

15:57.739 --> 16:01.264
YOU DEAL WITH CRIMINALS.

16:01.438 --> 16:06.269
OK? DRUG DEALERS,
BURGLARS, MURDERERS.

16:06.443 --> 16:08.793
ME, I DEAL WITH DEMONS.

16:08.968 --> 16:12.362
KAZIS, CREEPERS, GREMLOCKS.

16:12.536 --> 16:14.016
I COULD GO ON AND ON.

16:14.190 --> 16:16.279
BUT THE POINT IS,
THEY'RE VERY SIMILAR.

16:16.453 --> 16:19.630
CRIMINALS BAD, DEMONS BAD.

16:19.804 --> 16:21.763
IS IT SNACK TIME YET,
MISS MATTHEWS?

16:21.937 --> 16:23.199
HENRY.

16:23.373 --> 16:24.418
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE
TRYING TO SAY. OK?

16:24.592 --> 16:26.115
BUT WHAT I DON'T
UNDERSTAND IS,

16:26.289 --> 16:27.247
IF YOU HAVE
ALL THESE POWERS,

16:27.421 --> 16:28.248
WHY YOU DON'T USE THEM.

16:28.422 --> 16:30.032
I DO USE THEM.

16:30.206 --> 16:32.252
NO, NO, NO, NOT ON DEMONS.
I'M TALKING ABOUT HUNGER.

16:32.426 --> 16:34.558
I'M TALKING ABOUT THE POOR,
THE HOMELESS.

16:34.732 --> 16:37.083
MY CRIMINALS, MY BAD GUYS.

16:37.257 --> 16:40.042
IT'S REALLY ACTUALLY
NOT THAT SIMPLE.

16:40.216 --> 16:41.913
BUT WHY? WHO SAYS?

16:42.088 --> 16:45.091
I'M NOT TRYING TO MAKE
YOU FEEL BAD, OK?

16:45.265 --> 16:46.918
I DON'T UNDERSTAND,

16:47.093 --> 16:48.442
IF THERE'S MAGIC
IN THE WORLD,

16:48.616 --> 16:51.227
WHY YOU DON'T USE IT
TO SAVE THE WORLD.

16:51.401 --> 16:52.881
[CELL PHONE RINGS]

16:53.055 --> 16:55.536
THIS IS THE SECOND ONE.
I HAVE TO TAKE THIS.

16:55.710 --> 16:57.320
WE'LL FIGURE IT OUT
LATER.

16:59.105 --> 17:02.499
YEAH...
THAT WENT SWIMMINGLY.

17:02.673 --> 17:05.415
PAIGE,
GREAT, YOU'RE HERE.

17:05.589 --> 17:06.547
WHAT'S THIS?

17:11.639 --> 17:14.033
THE ANSWER
TO MY PROBLEMS.

17:14.207 --> 17:16.426
WE HAVE BIGGER PROBLEMS,
TRUST ME.

17:16.600 --> 17:19.647
BUDDHA'S STAFF--
THE DEMONS WANT IT.

17:19.821 --> 17:20.996
WE NEED THE BOOK.

17:21.170 --> 17:23.651
SORRY. NO CAN DO.
I HAVE TO HELP HENRY.

17:23.825 --> 17:25.696
NO, NO, NO.
HANG ON A SECOND.
WHOA.

17:25.870 --> 17:27.829
I THOUGHT THE WORDS
BUDDHA AND DEMONS

17:28.003 --> 17:29.352
WOULD GIVE YOU THE HINT
THAT I NEED YOUR HELP.

17:29.526 --> 17:32.094
NO, NOT REALLY.

17:32.268 --> 17:34.140
BYE. I HAVE
TO HELP HENRY NOW.

17:34.314 --> 17:35.315
BUT--BUT--

17:38.753 --> 17:40.581
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT?

17:42.974 --> 17:44.628
ANY LUCK?

17:44.802 --> 17:47.022
ARE YOU KIDDING?
I CAN'T MAKE SENSE
OF ANY OF THIS STUFF.

17:47.196 --> 17:49.155
THAT'S BECAUSE YOU'RE
USING YOUR EYES

17:49.329 --> 17:50.547
AND NOT YOUR POWERS.

17:50.721 --> 17:52.941
HOW CAN
TELEKINESIS HELP ME?

17:53.115 --> 17:54.812
I'M TALKING ABOUT
YOUR OTHER POWER,

17:54.986 --> 17:56.597
THE ONE YOU HAVE YET
TO MASTER,

17:56.771 --> 17:58.816
THE ONE
YOU NEED TO MASTER

17:58.990 --> 18:00.470
IF YOU TRULY
WANT ANSWERS.

18:00.644 --> 18:02.733

TO HELP ME FIND THE DEMON?

18:02.907 --> 18:05.171
AND TO FINDING
YOUR SISTER.

18:06.781 --> 18:08.783
I TOLD YOU
THIS PLACE WAS MAGICAL.

18:14.658 --> 18:16.443
AND SO
YOU HAVE BEEN LED HERE.

18:16.617 --> 18:19.750
BUT BEFORE YOU CAN HELP
THE ETERNAL CYCLE,

18:19.924 --> 18:22.013
YOU MUST HELP YOURSELF.

18:22.188 --> 18:25.016
OK, SO WHAT CAN YOU TELL ME
ABOUT CHRISTY?

18:25.191 --> 18:26.366
I CAN TELL YOU NOTHING.

18:26.540 --> 18:29.064
ONLY CHRISTY CAN
TELL YOU ABOUT CHRISTY.

18:29.238 --> 18:32.241
AND ONLY YOU HAVE THE POWER
TO SEEK THOSE ANSWERS.

18:32.415 --> 18:34.722
BUT I CAN'T EVEN CONTROL
MY PROJECTION POWER.

18:34.896 --> 18:36.680
I HAVEN'T EVEN USED IT
SINCE I KNEW I HAD IT.

18:36.854 --> 18:38.682

IT'S WAY TOO DANGEROUS.

OUT OF CONTROL, YES.

MORE THAN THAT.

OF THIS THING, BUT--

20:52.816 --> 20:54.035
TALK ABOUT THIS.

TALK FAST.

21:05.307 --> 21:06.787
CAN'T I JUST SIT
IN A CHAIR?

21:06.961 --> 21:09.224

23:17.613 --> 23:20.224
IT'S OK.
I'M NOT GOING TO HURT YOU.

23:24.141 --> 23:25.882
UNBELIEVABLE.

23:29.712 --> 23:31.453
WE DO NOT WISH
TO HARM YOU.

23:31.627 --> 23:34.935
WE THOUGHT YOU HAD
STOLEN THE SACRED STAFF.

TALK TO EACH OTHER?

GAVE ME THIS TO PROTECT.

23:42.290 --> 23:44.335

IS JUST A SERVANT.

23:44.510 --> 23:46.555
HE ONLY SPEAKS
WHEN SPOKEN TO.

23:46.729 --> 23:48.644
MAYBE YOU SHOULD
SPEAK TO HIM MORE OFTEN,

23:48.818 --> 23:50.994
CONSIDERING HE SEEMS TO KNOW
MORE ABOUT THIS THAN YOU DO.

23:51.168 --> 23:54.041
HE SHOULD HAVE HIDDEN
THE SACRED GARDEN BETTER
FROM THE DEMONS.

23:54.215 --> 23:55.434
MAYBE SO.

23:55.608 --> 23:57.305
BUT IF HE HADN'T
ANTICIPATED THE ATTACK,

23:57.479 --> 24:00.874
I WOULDN'T BE
HOLDING THIS RIGHT NOW,
WOULD I?

24:01.048 --> 24:02.266

24:07.533 --> 24:09.056
AND, YES, WE SENSED IT.

24:09.230 --> 24:10.753
THAT'S WHY
WE WERE SO AFRAID

24:10.927 --> 24:12.233
THE STAFF
HAD BEEN STOLEN.

24:12.407 --> 24:14.191
THE MOMENT
IT WAS OUT OF HIS HANDS,

WE BEGAN TRACKING IT...

24:15.628 --> 24:16.672
TO YOU.

24:16.846 --> 24:18.979
OK. WELL,
WOULD YOU LIKE IT BACK?

24:19.153 --> 24:22.809
NO. IT IS FORBIDDEN

OF YOUR OTHER ZODIACS

24:28.554 --> 24:29.816
HOLD IT FOR YOU UNTIL THEN?

24:29.990 --> 24:32.906
NO. IT WOULD UPSET
THE ETERNAL CYCLE,

24:33.080 --> 24:34.690
CHANGE THE BALANCE
OF ALL THINGS.

24:34.864 --> 24:37.867
GREAT. WHAT WOULD YOU
LIKE ME TO DO WITH IT?

24:38.041 --> 24:39.086
I'LL TAKE IT.

PROTECT THE STAFF!

24:58.453 --> 25:00.107
ONLY THE STAFF MATTERS.
GO!

FROM THIS ANGLE, HUH?

ARE YOU NUTS?

25:15.296 --> 25:17.777
W-W-WHAT ARE
WE DOING HERE NOW?

25:17.951 --> 25:20.301
WELL,
YOU HAVE SOME QUESTIONS,

25:20.475 --> 25:22.869
I'M TRYING TO FACILITATE
SOME ANSWERS.

25:23.043 --> 25:24.305
HOW?

25:24.479 --> 25:26.437
I TOLD YOU
ABOUT THE ELDERS, RIGHT?

25:26.612 --> 25:28.352
IF I CALL THEM DOWN HERE,

25:28.527 --> 25:29.876
THEY CAN
EXPLAIN THIS WHOLE THING

A LITTLE BIT MORE IN-DEPTH.

25:31.312 --> 25:32.661

25:32.835 --> 25:34.794
BECAUSE MY HEAD'S
STILL SPINNING.

TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND ME

AND THE WHOLE SHEBANG
THAT KIND OF GOES ALONG
WITH ME.

25:40.495 --> 25:42.802
RIGHT? AND I JUST FIGURED
WHAT BETTER WAY

25:42.976 --> 25:44.847
THAN TO ORB YOU
ALL AROUND THE WORLD

25:45.021 --> 25:46.327
TO REALLY SEE THINGS
FIRST-HAND.

I NEED YOUR HELP.

25:53.552 --> 25:56.511
AT THE MOMENT,
HENRY NEEDS MY HELP
A LITTLE BIT MORE.

25:56.685 --> 25:59.122
WOULD YOU
FORGET ABOUT HENRY
FOR ONE SECOND?

25:59.296 --> 26:00.254
THIS IS BAD.

26:00.428 --> 26:01.342
REALLY? HOW BAD?

26:01.516 --> 26:03.213
THINGS STOP SPINNING BAD.

26:03.387 --> 26:05.085
IF THE DEMON
GETS THE STAFF,

26:05.259 --> 26:07.696
THE ETERNAL CYCLE ENDS,
SOMETHING,

26:07.870 --> 26:09.263
AND THE WORLD TURNS EVIL.

26:09.437 --> 26:10.873
I DON'T KNOW.

26:11.047 --> 26:15.182
HMM...WORLD TURNING EVIL
OR MY RELATIONSHIP ENDING?

26:15.356 --> 26:17.706
THAT'S KIND OF
A TOUGH CHOICE.

26:17.880 --> 26:21.014
TOUGH CHOICE?
WHAT THE HELL IS
THE MATTER WITH YOU?

26:21.188 --> 26:23.059
NOTHING IS
THE MATTER WITH ME.

26:23.233 --> 26:24.539
I'M JUST REALLY FOCUSED
ON HENRY.

26:24.713 --> 26:26.497
WHEN DID YOU BECOME
SO OBSESSIVE?

26:26.672 --> 26:28.282
THAT IS MY DEAL.

26:28.456 --> 26:30.980

BUT MAYBE I LEARNED FROM
THE BEST, BIG SIS.

FELL OFF THE BRIDGE.

CALL YOU BACK.

COME BACK THERE!

BUT I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND AT ALL.

KNOW SHE HAS YET.

YOU CAN'T SAVE HER
FROM HER PAST, BILLIE.

I WANT TO DESTROY
THEM ALL,

33:28.963 --> 33:31.792
SO THAT THEY CAN NEVER TAKE THIS
AWAY FROM ME AGAIN.

33:31.966 --> 33:33.228
WHAT DO YOU WANT US
TO DO?

33:33.402 --> 33:36.971
AH, EAGER TO PLEASE.
I LIKE THAT.

33:37.145 --> 33:37.972
YOU'RE GOING TO KILL
LO PAN.

33:38.146 --> 33:39.974
LO PAN? THE SERVANT?

33:40.148 --> 33:41.280
HE'S MUCH MORE
THAN JUST THAT.

33:41.454 --> 33:43.934
THOUGH THE ZODIACS
ALL BUT DISMISS HIM,

33:44.109 --> 33:45.632
HE'S MUCH MORE IMPORTANT THAN
THEY GIVE HIM CREDIT FOR.

33:45.806 --> 33:50.289
IN FACT,
HE'S THE KEY TO CONTINUING
THE ETERNAL CYCLE.

33:50.463 --> 33:52.769
HE PROTECTS
THE SACRED GARDEN.

33:52.943 --> 33:55.120
WITHOUT IT, THEY'RE NOTHING.

33:55.294 --> 33:56.295
THEN WHAT?

33:56.469 --> 34:00.125
THEN...
THE YEAR OF EVIL BEGINS.

34:06.827 --> 34:08.524
WHERE IS HE?

34:08.698 --> 34:09.960
HE SHOULD BE HERE.

34:11.440 --> 34:12.963
HEY, WHAT ARE YOU GUYS
DOING HERE?

34:13.138 --> 34:14.095
LOOKING FOR HIM.

34:14.269 --> 34:15.488
LO PAN? WHY?

34:15.662 --> 34:17.838
THE DEMONS ARE COMING.
WE HAVE TO--

34:18.012 --> 34:19.448
HEY, WHERE'S THE STAFF?

34:21.537 --> 34:22.582
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING?

34:22.756 --> 34:25.063
MAKING OUR
NEW YEAR'S RESOLUTIONS.

34:27.065 --> 34:28.240
GET DOWN!

34:29.632 --> 34:30.894
YOU MISSED.

34:31.069 --> 34:34.028
EVIL INFLUENCES THEM.

34:34.202 --> 34:35.377
THAT MEANS
THE DEMON HAS THE STAFF.

34:35.551 --> 34:36.291
OH, THAT'S JUST GREAT.
WELL, WHAT DO WE DO?

34:36.465 --> 34:37.945
WE DO NOTHING.

34:38.119 --> 34:39.729
YOU LEARNED
TO CONTROL YOUR POWER
FOR THIS MOMENT.

34:39.903 --> 34:41.209
WHAT? ARE YOU CRAZY?
I'M NOT GOING UP
AGAINST THEM!

34:41.383 --> 34:43.603
YOU HAVE TO IF YOU WANT
TO SAVE YOUR SISTER.

34:43.777 --> 34:46.606
FOCUS.
PROJECT WHAT YOU WISH.

34:46.780 --> 34:47.737
OHH...

34:50.653 --> 34:53.221
BILLIE, WE DON'T WANT
TO HURT YOU.

34:53.395 --> 34:55.005
SURE, WE DO.

34:55.180 --> 34:56.964
BOULDER!

35:00.359 --> 35:01.621
KILL HER.

35:09.237 --> 35:10.412
WHAT JUST HAPPENED?

35:12.414 --> 35:13.676
WHAT ARE WE DOING HERE?

35:13.850 --> 35:15.765
OH, NO BIG DEAL.

35:15.939 --> 35:17.376
YOU WERE JUST TRYING
TO KILL ME,

35:17.550 --> 35:18.899
BUT I CHANGED YOUR MINDS.

35:26.428 --> 35:27.690
I DON'T LIKE IT.

35:27.864 --> 35:29.039
WE SHOULD'VE KILLED LO PAN
OURSELVES.

35:29.214 --> 35:30.215
TOO MANY YEARS
OF FAILED ATTEMPTS

35:30.389 --> 35:34.393
HAVE TURNED YOU CYNICAL,
MY FRIEND.

35:34.567 --> 35:36.569
YOU'VE GO TO LEARN
TO THINK MORE POSITIVELY

35:36.743 --> 35:40.138
NOW THAT EVIL'S FINALLY
TAKEN OVER THE WORLD.

35:41.400 --> 35:42.923
SAD, REALLY.

35:43.097 --> 35:44.490
NOW WHAT DO WE DO?

35:46.405 --> 35:48.407
[FOOTSTEPS]

35:48.581 --> 35:51.497
WELL, I WISH I HAD
A PITHY RETORT,

35:51.671 --> 35:53.629
BUT YOU'RE REALLY
NOT WORTH IT.

35:55.153 --> 35:56.066
YOU WERE SAYING?

35:56.241 --> 35:57.155
NOW.

36:08.078 --> 36:09.341
QUICK, COVER IT UP.

36:13.475 --> 36:15.782
UH, DO ME A FAVOR...

36:15.956 --> 36:18.088
AND BE CAREFUL
WHAT YOU WISH FOR,

36:18.263 --> 36:20.134
ESPECIALLY
AROUND THE BOYS.

36:20.308 --> 36:23.311
I HAVEN'T EXACTLY
MASTERED IT, ANYWAY,
SO...

36:23.485 --> 36:26.053
I THINK THAT
WOULD BE HER POINT.

36:26.227 --> 36:27.794
WELL,
IT'S ALMOST MIDNIGHT,

36:27.968 --> 36:30.492
SO WE SHOULD
GET THIS THING BACK
BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.

36:30.666 --> 36:33.016
CAN'T.
GOT TO GO APOLOGIZE
TO MY BOYFRIEND.

36:33.321 --> 36:35.236
I HAVE TO EXPLAIN
TO THE NEIGHBORS.

36:35.410 --> 36:37.456
AND I HAVE A SISTER
TO SCRY FOR.

36:56.170 --> 36:57.867
WHAT'S GOING ON?
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

36:58.041 --> 37:01.784
IT SEEMS THAT
I HAVE BEEN...ELEVATED.

37:01.958 --> 37:04.657
I AM NOW ROOSTER.

37:04.831 --> 37:06.441
THE STAFF,
IF YOU PLEASE.

37:06.615 --> 37:08.443
OH, GLADLY.

37:10.750 --> 37:12.317
YOU RECEIVED THE SIGN
FOR A REASON, PIPER,

37:12.491 --> 37:15.276
AND NOT JUST TO HELP
PERPETUATE THE CYCLE,

37:15.450 --> 37:16.799
BUT TO HELP
THE BOTH OF US AS WELL.

37:16.973 --> 37:19.149
HOW EXACTLY WAS I HELPED?

37:19.324 --> 37:23.066
YOU'VE SHOWN THAT PATIENCE
CAN BE REWARDED

37:23.241 --> 37:24.285
FOR ME AND FOR YOU.

37:25.982 --> 37:27.462
LEO WILL COME BACK

37:27.636 --> 37:28.811
ONLY IF HE'S MEANT TO.

37:28.985 --> 37:31.161
AND ONLY WHEN IT'S TIME.

37:31.336 --> 37:32.641
NOT BEFORE.

38:06.109 --> 38:08.764
FUNNY, I FIGURED
AFTER LAST TIME,

38:08.938 --> 38:11.724
THIS WOULD BE THE LAST PLACE
YOU'D WANT TO COME BACK TO.

38:11.898 --> 38:14.335
YEAH, I DID HAVE
TO THINK ABOUT IT.

38:14.509 --> 38:17.033
NOT ABOUT US, BUT...

38:17.207 --> 38:18.948
THE MAGIC.

38:19.122 --> 38:20.602
AND?

38:22.778 --> 38:25.607
AND AFTER EVERYTHING
THAT YOU DID TODAY,

38:25.781 --> 38:27.000
I MEAN, NOT JUST THIS,

38:27.174 --> 38:30.177
BUT THE WHOLE
ETERNAL CYCLE DEAL,

38:30.351 --> 38:32.222
I GET IT.

38:32.397 --> 38:35.878
THIS ISN'T, UM,
FREAKING YOU OUT?

38:36.052 --> 38:37.097
YOU'RE NOT MAD AT ME?

38:37.271 --> 38:38.359
I WAS NEVER MAD AT YOU,
PAIGE,

38:38.533 --> 38:39.926
OR FREAKED OUT.

38:40.100 --> 38:41.884
WELL, I GOT
A LITTLE FREAKED OUT

38:42.058 --> 38:44.060
WHEN THOSE WILD PYGMIES
WERE CHASING US
BACK THEN.

38:44.234 --> 38:46.236
SORRY. THAT WAS
AN ACCIDENTAL ORB.

38:46.411 --> 38:49.327
THAT'S OK.
IT HELPED ME SEE
THE BIGGER PICTURE.

38:53.287 --> 38:57.378
YOU USE YOUR POWERS
TO MAKE THE WORLD
A BETTER PLACE.

38:57.552 --> 38:59.598
HOW COULD I HAVE
A PROBLEM WITH THAT?

38:59.772 --> 39:01.251
I THINK IT'S AMAZING.

39:01.426 --> 39:03.036
YOU DO?

39:04.385 --> 39:07.910
AND I THINK
I'M FALLING IN LOVE
WITH YOU.

39:14.264 --> 39:17.398
I THINK I'M FALLING
IN LOVE WITH YOU, TOO.

39:43.424 --> 39:44.599
CHRISTY?
