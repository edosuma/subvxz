00:25.458 --> 00:28.093
<i>Zimmerman was
an ordinary guy,</i>

00:28.095 --> 00:30.628
<i>not much different from you
or me.</i>

00:30.630 --> 00:34.632
<i>But one day, he woke up alone
and confused.</i>

00:34.634 --> 00:36.038
Mr. Zimmerman.

00:36.636 --> 00:38.470
Welcome back.

00:38.472 --> 00:40.472
You'd probably
won't remember this,

00:40.474 --> 00:42.774
but you were on
a pretty massive pile-up

00:42.776 --> 00:44.442
out there on the turnpike.

00:44.444 --> 00:45.212
You're lucky.

00:46.279 --> 00:48.582
Everything is going to be
just fine.

00:50.517 --> 00:52.319
Well, mostly everything.

00:57.492 --> 01:01.128
Your penis was chopped
off in the wreck.

01:01.130 --> 01:02.729
- My...
- Yes.

01:02.731 --> 01:04.834
Mr. Zimmerman, your penis.

01:06.902 --> 01:09.469
<i>But the news
wasn't all bad.</i>

01:09.471 --> 01:11.871
<i>The doctor explains
that Zimmerman could use</i>

01:11.873 --> 01:15.142
<i>his 90,000 dollars
insurance settlement</i>

01:15.144 --> 01:19.345
<i>to build a brand new penis.
But it doesn't come cheap,</i>

01:19.347 --> 01:22.848
<i>approximately 10,000 bucks
an inch.</i>

01:22.850 --> 01:26.089
Talk to your wife
before you make any decisions.

01:27.924 --> 01:30.458
After all,
getting all nine inches

01:30.460 --> 01:32.693
may be a big adjustment for her.

01:32.695 --> 01:35.630
And, getting less...

01:35.632 --> 01:37.265
well...

01:37.267 --> 01:39.267
you understand my concern.

01:39.269 --> 01:40.902
<i>Zimmerman
sees his wife that night</i>

01:40.904 --> 01:42.602
<i>and they have a heart
to heart.</i>

01:42.604 --> 01:44.604
Good morning
Mr. Zimmerman.

01:44.606 --> 01:46.440
Have you spoken
with your wife?

01:46.442 --> 01:48.277
- I have.
- Excellent.

01:48.279 --> 01:50.546
And did she help you
with the decision?

01:50.548 --> 01:51.879
Yes, doctor she has.

01:51.881 --> 01:54.316
And what have you decided
to do?

01:54.318 --> 01:56.652
We're getting brand new
marble counter tops.

01:58.221 --> 02:00.791
"Brand new marble counter tops."

02:05.828 --> 02:08.797
They're beautiful,
like dancers.

02:08.799 --> 02:13.303
They were buried alive
for almost 2,000 years, mother.

02:13.305 --> 02:15.437
No air, no moisture.

02:15.439 --> 02:17.607
Hermetically sealed in ash.

02:17.609 --> 02:19.909
- Lucky.
- Lucky?

02:19.911 --> 02:23.645
Nothing changed,
nothing rotted away or grew.

02:23.647 --> 02:25.667
That's why we have it today.

02:26.550 --> 02:29.719
Wish I could go back 20 years
and seal myself in ash.

02:29.721 --> 02:31.954
They were burnt alive.

02:31.956 --> 02:33.626
These people were all...

02:34.592 --> 02:35.560
were all...

02:37.330 --> 02:38.461
Um...

02:38.463 --> 02:39.699
Well...

02:41.968 --> 02:43.667
All the lives...

02:43.669 --> 02:45.171
all living, breathing...

02:45.871 --> 02:47.337
and laughing.

02:47.339 --> 02:49.472
Making love and dreaming

02:49.474 --> 02:51.577
when the cinder came raining
from the sky.

02:53.980 --> 02:56.880
Or something like that I...
I'm still working on...

02:56.882 --> 02:58.843
still working on... on this...

02:59.418 --> 03:00.421
this speech.

03:03.422 --> 03:04.624
Great job, everybody.

03:11.797 --> 03:13.531
In my defense,
the play was finished

03:13.533 --> 03:17.034
when I sent it to you,
but then I had some ideas,

03:17.036 --> 03:19.304
inspirations, and I...

03:19.306 --> 03:20.905
I started re-writing, I...

03:20.907 --> 03:22.674
- I thought maybe...
- Who gives a fuck?

03:22.676 --> 03:23.908
<i>Nathan Lane</i>

03:23.910 --> 03:25.277
<i>on line one.</i>

03:25.279 --> 03:26.812
I'll call him back.

03:26.814 --> 03:29.414
This is the third time
we've tried to start rehearsals,

03:29.416 --> 03:30.815
and we still don't have
an ending.

03:30.817 --> 03:32.787
- Yeah, but, C.C....
- No "But, C.C."

03:33.921 --> 03:35.390
We're closed.

03:36.323 --> 03:38.991
Call me when it's really done.

03:38.993 --> 03:41.627
On second thought,
don't call me.

03:41.629 --> 03:45.397
I think it's better if
we don't work together anymore.

03:45.399 --> 03:47.033
Come here baby,
come here baby.

03:47.035 --> 03:48.571
Come back to mummy.

03:54.643 --> 03:55.711
You're all right?

03:57.012 --> 03:58.314
What's going on?

04:00.816 --> 04:02.616
I need to make a change, Nate.

04:02.618 --> 04:05.851
I feel like I'm a bug
caught in amber.

04:05.853 --> 04:07.386
You're the amber.

04:07.388 --> 04:08.290
What are you talking about?

04:09.558 --> 04:11.691
Things are happening.
The play is happening.

04:11.693 --> 04:12.859
Is that true?

04:12.861 --> 04:14.629
Tell me it's true,
tell me, you staged

04:14.631 --> 04:16.529
the entire play today,
from start to finish

04:16.531 --> 04:18.334
and I will unpack
every last thing.

04:19.334 --> 04:20.269
The entire play?

04:21.337 --> 04:23.571
- That's what I thought.
- Oh, wait.

04:23.573 --> 04:25.340
Quality work takes time.

04:25.342 --> 04:28.542
I know, Nate. It just...
It can't be my time anymore.

04:28.544 --> 04:29.910
You stopped taking care
of yourself.

04:29.912 --> 04:31.646
I think you have
a rotten molar.

04:31.648 --> 04:32.879
Your breath smells.

04:32.881 --> 04:35.116
When was the last time
you went to the dentist?

04:35.118 --> 04:36.755
Never mind.
You're getting fat.

04:38.122 --> 04:42.858
- Here, I found this stuff.
- I'm not getting that fat.

04:42.860 --> 04:44.993
My client, Henri asked me

04:44.995 --> 04:47.863
to spend time with him
in Cap d'Antibes.

04:47.865 --> 04:49.865
Henri the billionaire?

04:49.867 --> 04:51.670
You make it sound
like it's a bad thing.

04:54.771 --> 04:56.408
Are you leaving me for him?

05:03.914 --> 05:05.016
Oh.

05:06.118 --> 05:07.486
I feel queasy.

05:16.661 --> 05:20.633
Daddy, all these sea lions
basking in the sun?

05:26.805 --> 05:29.375
Daddy, bark like a sea lion.

05:37.816 --> 05:39.916
I really think you should
reconsider this.

05:39.918 --> 05:42.720
- Gabe needs his mom.
- I'm taking Gabe.

05:42.722 --> 05:44.103
You... you're taking him?

05:44.790 --> 05:47.591
No. You can't just... you...
you just can't decide,

05:47.593 --> 05:48.626
you know how...

05:48.628 --> 05:50.462
you're gonna take off to France
with our son.

05:50.464 --> 05:52.464
Okay, Nate, what've you planned
for Gabe this summer?

05:52.466 --> 05:55.032
Have you signed him up
for a camp? Swimming lessons?

05:55.034 --> 05:57.001
- Anything?
- That's not fair.

05:57.003 --> 05:58.638
- I didn't know that I was...
- His dad?

06:05.178 --> 06:08.046
- I'm gonna miss you so much.
- You should come.

06:08.048 --> 06:10.681
- Want me to talk to mummy?
- Could you?

06:10.683 --> 06:11.850
Yeah.

06:11.852 --> 06:12.987
That probably won't work.

06:17.225 --> 06:18.960
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

06:22.896 --> 06:25.898
When we return, we'll come stay
at Henri's house up-town,

06:25.900 --> 06:28.501
and we can
work everything out then.

06:28.503 --> 06:30.903
Here is rent checks
for the next two months

06:30.905 --> 06:35.040
that are there, I'd give you
a chance to figure yourself out.

06:35.042 --> 06:37.077
You think you're gonna
take our son and run off

06:37.079 --> 06:40.747
with some French billionaire
and just wash away your guilt

06:40.749 --> 06:42.683
with a little rent money.

06:42.685 --> 06:46.887
You cannot bribe me
to ease your conscience, Nirit.

06:46.889 --> 06:48.988
If that's how you want it,
I'll have the packers

06:48.990 --> 06:51.794
and movers here on Friday,
the lease is up next week.

06:54.697 --> 06:56.132
Oh, the lease is over next week?

06:57.632 --> 07:00.068
Gabe is gonna see things, Nate.

07:00.070 --> 07:01.872
Don't let yourself become
irrelevant.

07:06.275 --> 07:07.177
Daddy.

07:08.179 --> 07:10.815
- Yes, Gabe?
- You're not supposed to litter.

07:33.204 --> 07:36.038
- What's up, Nate?
- Hey, Randy.

07:36.040 --> 07:38.106
- How's it going?
- Well, it's, uh...

07:38.108 --> 07:41.310
- it's a little hectic here.
- <i>Oh, yeah? Why is that?</i>

07:41.312 --> 07:43.245
Uh, we have triplets.
Did you forget?

07:43.247 --> 07:45.647
<i>No, of course I didn't forget,
I just thought, you know,</i>

07:45.649 --> 07:46.882
after eight months.

07:46.884 --> 07:48.620
Well, it doesn't get any easier.

07:50.721 --> 07:52.157
Nirit left me
and she took Gabe...

07:53.257 --> 07:55.325
for a billionaire,
a French one.

07:55.327 --> 07:56.495
Oh, man.

07:57.229 --> 07:58.828
- Was it unexpected?
- <i>Uh,</i>

07:58.830 --> 08:00.864
no, we planned it
a year in advance.

08:00.866 --> 08:02.502
I'm... I'm sorry, um...

08:03.801 --> 08:04.835
What can I do?

08:04.837 --> 08:07.139
<i>Do you think I could crash there
for a while?</i>

08:08.740 --> 08:10.172
You want to crash here?

08:10.174 --> 08:13.744
Yeah, in your guest room,
just until I finish my play.

08:13.746 --> 08:16.079
Look, why don't you call dad?
He's got that spare room.

08:16.081 --> 08:18.615
You know what, man,
forget I said anything.

08:18.617 --> 08:21.151
I got a bunch of people
who I can call.

08:21.153 --> 08:22.288
I'll tell you one thing now...

08:23.790 --> 08:25.124
I'm not staying with dad.

08:52.353 --> 08:53.952
Who are you here to see?

08:53.954 --> 08:55.920
Uh, Bob Kroll, I'm his son.

08:55.922 --> 08:59.156
No, no, Bob Kroll,
he's lived here for five years,

08:59.158 --> 09:03.195
and I've seen his son
and his son is long and tall,

09:03.197 --> 09:04.332
and fine looking.

09:05.066 --> 09:06.301
I'm his other son.

10:08.331 --> 10:09.332
Hi Dad.

10:12.870 --> 10:13.804
So...

10:14.771 --> 10:16.337
what do you think of the place?

10:16.339 --> 10:17.708
It's, uh...

10:18.443 --> 10:19.778
you know, it's very...

10:21.378 --> 10:22.977
- beige.
- I can't believe

10:22.979 --> 10:24.480
you've never been here before.

10:24.482 --> 10:26.816
- Gabe would love the pool.
- Yeah, thank you

10:26.818 --> 10:28.984
for your sensitivity
of my current situation, dad.

10:28.986 --> 10:32.053
Would you like a diet cream soda
or something?

10:32.055 --> 10:33.090
No, that's okay.

10:34.925 --> 10:36.760
Well, let's get your room
made up.

10:36.762 --> 10:38.260
I'll take your stuff upstairs.

10:38.262 --> 10:40.429
- I'll get that, dad, it's heavy.
- No, no, no, I can get it.

10:40.431 --> 10:43.068
- I'll get it, dad.
- Oh! Yeah it is.

10:52.277 --> 10:54.680
The old fake heart attack.

10:55.748 --> 10:57.016
Other people think I'm funny.

11:00.920 --> 11:03.054
- Did she tell you her beef?
- "Her beef"?

11:03.056 --> 11:04.354
What do you mean, "Her beef?"

11:04.356 --> 11:06.790
You know why she was unhappy?

11:06.792 --> 11:08.391
She left me
for a billionaire,

11:08.393 --> 11:09.493
that could be our first clue.

11:09.495 --> 11:10.895
You think
it was about money?

11:10.897 --> 11:12.997
I don't really know
what it was about.

11:12.999 --> 11:15.466
Okay. So what's your plan?

11:15.468 --> 11:16.901
Plan?

11:16.903 --> 11:19.035
Yeah, I thought
maybe you'd have a plan.

11:19.037 --> 11:21.506
Yeah, I've got a plan,
I'm gonna call Paul and Ringo,

11:21.508 --> 11:23.109
see if we can get a band
back together.

11:24.812 --> 11:27.079
This bed needs some WD-40.

11:27.081 --> 11:29.013
We'll put it on the list.

11:29.015 --> 11:32.383
Now, the towels are in there,
and if you need anything else,

11:32.385 --> 11:33.855
- just let me know.
- Okay.

11:39.192 --> 11:41.225
- This will cheer you up.
- I'm not really in a joke mood.

11:41.227 --> 11:42.927
Zimmerman goes to see
the doctor.

11:42.929 --> 11:44.028
I'm not in a joke mood.

11:44.030 --> 11:45.329
Zimmerman goes to see
his doctor.

11:45.331 --> 11:47.867
- I'm not gonna laugh.
- The doctor says,

11:47.869 --> 11:49.903
"I don't know
how to tell you this,

11:49.905 --> 11:51.470
but you gotta
stop masturbating."

11:51.472 --> 11:53.105
And Zimmerman says, "Why?"

11:53.107 --> 11:54.977
The doctor says,
"So I can examine you."

11:56.244 --> 11:59.579
Life's gonna happen, son,
whether you smile or not.

11:59.581 --> 12:00.382
Yeah.

12:01.415 --> 12:04.050
Well, I got dinner plans
tonight, out with Connie.

12:04.052 --> 12:05.484
You're welcome to come
if you want.

12:05.486 --> 12:07.085
We're going
to the Turkish place,

12:07.087 --> 12:08.287
it's a strip mall.

12:08.289 --> 12:10.322
I got a little diarrhea there
one time,

12:10.324 --> 12:12.493
but usually it's not too bad.

12:12.495 --> 12:14.028
I think I'll pass.

12:14.030 --> 12:16.062
- Whose Connie?
- You know, Connie,

12:16.064 --> 12:18.064
Connie. Check the fridge,

12:18.066 --> 12:21.534
I... I think we have some...
some leftovers.

13:14.759 --> 13:17.627
- <i>Where are you anyway?</i>
- I'm at dad's place in Jersey,

13:17.629 --> 13:19.395
I didn't have many options.

13:19.397 --> 13:21.930
- <i>How's your dad?</i>
- He's the same.

13:21.932 --> 13:24.401
Next time, could we do this
at a more reasonable hour?

13:25.571 --> 13:28.437
<i>We have stuff going on all day,
swimming lessons,</i>

13:28.439 --> 13:30.407
<i>sailing, tennis, it's just hard
to schedule something</i>

13:30.409 --> 13:31.575
<i>in the middle of all that.</i>

13:31.577 --> 13:33.576
Fine. Can I see him please?

13:33.578 --> 13:34.847
<i>Of course.</i>

13:38.016 --> 13:39.248
Hey...

13:39.250 --> 13:41.218
- Gabe.
- <i>Hi, daddy.</i>

13:42.487 --> 13:45.656
- <i>Bonjour, papa.</i>
- I miss you so much.

13:45.658 --> 13:47.358
- How are you?
- <i>Bon.</i>

13:47.360 --> 13:49.494
- <i>That means, " good."</i>
- Are you having fun?

13:49.496 --> 13:50.994
It's okay if you're not.

13:50.996 --> 13:53.163
- You can tell daddy.
- <i>Lots of fun.</i>

13:53.165 --> 13:55.265
<i>There's toys, and a pool,</i>

13:55.267 --> 13:57.000
<i>and there's these people
that would get you</i>

13:57.002 --> 13:58.635
<i>whatever you want
whenever you want.</i>

13:58.637 --> 14:00.337
Servants, they're called,
"servants."

14:00.339 --> 14:03.074
- <i>Don't we like that?</i>
- <i>Au revoir, papa.</i>

14:03.076 --> 14:04.178
Are... Bye.

14:05.477 --> 14:08.046
Nirit listen,
come home please.

14:08.048 --> 14:12.952
- I need you guys. I can change.
- <i>I'm afraid that ship has sunk.</i>

14:12.954 --> 14:14.452
- Oh, oh, I can finish...
- <i>Bonjour, Henri.</i>

14:36.478 --> 14:38.377
- Looking for coffee?
- Oh, shit!

14:38.379 --> 14:39.347
I'm sorry.

14:40.614 --> 14:42.183
- Connie?
- Nate?

14:42.718 --> 14:44.150
Yeah.

14:44.152 --> 14:48.387
Nice to meet you.
I've heard a lot about you.

14:48.389 --> 14:50.058
Your dad's out golfing.

14:51.192 --> 14:54.294
- Are you his girlfriend?
- Well,

14:54.296 --> 14:56.596
I... I guess you could say that.

14:56.598 --> 14:59.566
- Do you, uh, live here?
- Sometimes.

14:59.568 --> 15:03.603
I have my own place, but,
I just stay with your dad...

15:03.605 --> 15:04.975
sometimes.

15:05.674 --> 15:08.209
Your father is a pistol.

15:08.211 --> 15:10.578
Sharing is not his strong suite.

15:10.580 --> 15:12.313
Uh, do you know
where the coffee is?

15:12.315 --> 15:14.180
Oh, we don't keep any.

15:14.182 --> 15:15.718
Bob's not supposed to have it.

15:18.254 --> 15:20.688
We have cans of diet cream soda.

15:20.690 --> 15:23.056
Isn't regular cream soda
disgusting enough?

15:23.058 --> 15:25.727
Yeah, I gotta go to work.

15:25.729 --> 15:28.599
Oh, he wanted you to take
a look at that legal pad.

16:18.818 --> 16:20.020
Declined.

16:20.752 --> 16:22.155
Wait, hold... hold on a second.

16:53.519 --> 16:55.588
- Can I help you?
- You don't remember me?

16:56.756 --> 16:58.256
From yesterday?

16:58.258 --> 16:59.628
I do not remember you.

17:02.395 --> 17:04.098
Bob Kroll's other son.

17:10.170 --> 17:11.205
How's it going?

17:12.239 --> 17:14.540
You know it's...
it's going.

17:14.541 --> 17:16.907
How long have you been working
on this one?

17:16.910 --> 17:19.313
Not long.
Four years.

17:21.482 --> 17:22.714
What's it about?

17:22.715 --> 17:24.349
Dad, don't pretend you care
about my writing.

17:24.352 --> 17:25.484
Am I in this one?

17:25.487 --> 17:28.788
It's specifically about the trip
mom took with Grammy.

17:28.790 --> 17:32.359
But I'm just using that
as a platform to explore...

17:32.361 --> 17:33.396
So, I'm not in it?

17:34.295 --> 17:36.163
- No.
- Good.

17:36.165 --> 17:38.197
Have you had a chance to look
at this list?

17:38.199 --> 17:40.800
- Uh, no, not really.
- Well, I'll leave it here

17:40.802 --> 17:44.771
for you, I'd like you to try
to do one or two things a day.

17:44.773 --> 17:47.375
You could start with the WD-40.

17:47.377 --> 17:49.577
- Okay dad, I'll try.
- I'll appreciate it.

17:49.579 --> 17:51.582
While your here
I could use your help.

17:54.484 --> 17:57.685
Dad... we used to have this, uh,

17:57.687 --> 18:00.187
reproduction of a figure
from Pompeii.

18:00.189 --> 18:02.723
It was a woman
laying on her side,

18:02.725 --> 18:04.358
uh, holding up her hands

18:04.360 --> 18:07.227
to shield her child
from the ash.

18:07.229 --> 18:09.330
- Do you remember?
- Vaguely.

18:09.332 --> 18:10.801
I'd like to use it in the play.

18:11.669 --> 18:13.669
- Do you know where it is?
- Have you looked in that closet,

18:13.671 --> 18:15.437
there's a lot of old junk
in there.

18:15.439 --> 18:18.207
- Yeah, yeah, I looked.
- Okay, well, I'd like you to try

18:18.209 --> 18:21.642
to get one or two things
a day done from that list.

18:21.644 --> 18:22.646
I heard you.

18:29.452 --> 18:32.720
Maybe Nate's blocked,
did you ask him if he's blocked?

18:32.722 --> 18:34.790
You wanna talk about, "blocked."

18:34.792 --> 18:38.393
If my body were Ireland,
my ass would be County Cork.

18:40.464 --> 18:42.864
If my body were Poland,
my ass would be Krakow.

18:44.902 --> 18:47.769
He may be blocked,
but he needs to do something.

18:47.771 --> 18:50.573
It's not good for him to sit up
in that room all day.

18:50.575 --> 18:52.941
He's a writer,
what do you expect him to do?

18:52.943 --> 18:55.644
You know Mary Higgins Clark?
She writes a novel a year.

18:55.646 --> 18:57.513
- Really?
- I can tell

18:57.515 --> 18:59.583
when people are productive.

18:59.585 --> 19:01.884
He's not being productive
up there.

19:01.886 --> 19:03.853
Yeah, maybe you should send him
to Ellis, Bob.

19:03.855 --> 19:04.723
I mean...

19:05.758 --> 19:07.490
Ellis is always looking
for help.

19:07.492 --> 19:09.492
- What about roughage?
- What about roughage?

19:09.494 --> 19:11.527
- You're a dentist.
- It'll get him unblocked.

19:18.871 --> 19:21.037
He didn't do one thing
on the list.

19:21.039 --> 19:23.307
He's been up there working.

19:23.309 --> 19:24.776
You haven't seen him at all?

19:24.778 --> 19:26.510
Well, he came down
a couple of times

19:26.512 --> 19:27.845
to get stuff in the fridge,

19:27.847 --> 19:30.981
and then once he was
looking around for something.

19:30.983 --> 19:33.287
He needs to eat.

19:34.620 --> 19:36.688
Where are my diet cream sodas?

19:36.690 --> 19:39.691
Oh, give him a break.
I can get you more soda.

19:39.693 --> 19:40.560
Nate?

19:41.427 --> 19:42.661
- Nate?
- Look,

19:42.663 --> 19:44.762
I'm gonna go to rehearsal.

19:44.764 --> 19:49.669
You can stay here,
I made you some nice stir fry.

19:49.671 --> 19:51.873
Have a goodnight.
I'll see you later.

19:52.940 --> 19:54.673
- What's up?
- Good news.

19:54.675 --> 19:57.410
I found you a job.
You start tomorrow morning.

19:57.412 --> 19:59.377
Come on, dad, don't start
that shit, I'm busy.

19:59.379 --> 20:01.047
You've been working on that play
four years,

20:01.049 --> 20:02.115
that's your business,

20:02.117 --> 20:05.684
but you are not going to sit up
in my guest room,

20:05.686 --> 20:09.087
eat my food,
and drink my diet cream sodas

20:09.089 --> 20:11.525
while you write that play
for another four.

20:11.527 --> 20:14.493
- When am I supposed to write?
- You can write in the evening.

20:14.495 --> 20:15.831
Or early in the morning.

20:16.598 --> 20:19.633
Mary Higgins Clark

20:19.635 --> 20:22.469
would get up at 5:00 a.m.
to write,

20:22.471 --> 20:23.770
and then take her kids
to school.

20:23.772 --> 20:25.771
- Mary Higgins who?
- Don't be such a snob.

20:25.773 --> 20:29.343
You should only be so successful
as Mary Higgins Clark.

20:29.345 --> 20:32.445
Tomorrow morning,
you're going to meet Ellis,

20:32.447 --> 20:34.948
9:00 a.m. at the club house.

20:34.950 --> 20:37.387
You'll like him,
he's a lovely fellow.

20:49.398 --> 20:52.099
- You must be Nate.
- Yeah.

20:52.101 --> 20:54.971
Do you know where we can get
some coffee around here?

20:56.805 --> 20:58.007
Tuck in your shirt, son.

21:01.712 --> 21:03.412
Oh, why?

21:03.414 --> 21:05.414
Because your gonna have
some pride in yourself

21:05.416 --> 21:06.751
if you're going to work with me.

21:09.387 --> 21:10.722
This is ridiculous.

21:11.655 --> 21:13.107
Your old man was right.

21:13.890 --> 21:16.960
He said you didn't have
the fortitude to hold the job.

21:31.142 --> 21:32.410
Before we begin...

21:33.644 --> 21:37.013
let's do a quick reconnaissance
of the HQ.

21:37.015 --> 21:39.648
<i>First up,
the berry ballroom,</i>

21:39.650 --> 21:42.118
<i>a multi-purpose room equipped
with an upright piano,</i>

21:42.120 --> 21:43.887
<i>and a parquet dance floor.</i>

21:47.626 --> 21:51.529
<i>It's currently configured
for guest lecture.</i>

21:51.531 --> 21:52.547
<i>A mess hall.</i>

21:53.333 --> 21:56.833
<i>Serving breakfast, lunch
and Wednesday smorgasbord.</i>

21:58.103 --> 22:03.040
<i>Combination bar-cafe with Wi-Fi
for Skyping with grandchildren.</i>

22:03.042 --> 22:04.975
So you don't like pizza?

22:04.977 --> 22:09.713
<i>Driving range,
with an 18 hole golf course,</i>

22:09.715 --> 22:11.582
<i>an indoor pool.</i>

22:11.584 --> 22:13.520
<i>Bathing caps required.</i>

22:17.090 --> 22:19.557
<i>Locker rooms, featuring a sauna,</i>

22:19.559 --> 22:22.593
<i>a steam room,
and massage facilities.</i>

22:22.595 --> 22:24.965
<i>Those really big balls...</i>

22:26.033 --> 22:28.136
<i>and all the other gym equipment.</i>

22:31.738 --> 22:33.039
<i>And of course,</i>

22:33.739 --> 22:34.876
<i>my domain.</i>

22:35.643 --> 22:36.812
<i>A physical plant.</i>

22:37.845 --> 22:39.614
This is where you're going
to work.

22:40.614 --> 22:41.549
Here in the bowl?

22:42.155 --> 22:45.720
This isn't the bowl, son.
It's the guts.

22:46.820 --> 22:48.955
Fold it in thirds,

22:48.957 --> 22:50.523
and then...

22:50.525 --> 22:51.593
once over.

22:52.960 --> 22:55.029
- Got it?
- Am I getting paid for this?

22:56.797 --> 22:59.499
I believe you father
has garnished your wages

22:59.501 --> 23:00.769
in lieu of rent.

23:02.872 --> 23:03.873
Fold!

23:05.808 --> 23:07.607
<i>Did I ever tell you
about the time</i>

23:07.609 --> 23:09.011
<i>Zimmerman joined the marines?</i>

23:11.113 --> 23:13.079
<i>He was in basic training.</i>

23:13.081 --> 23:14.847
Have you been up
to the tower jump yet?

23:14.849 --> 23:16.850
- No, you?
- Yeah.

23:16.852 --> 23:19.018
<i>But he was afraid
of heights.</i>

23:19.020 --> 23:21.121
<i>So he was scared, terrified.</i>

23:21.123 --> 23:22.923
Nope! Can't.

23:22.925 --> 23:24.758
I can't, No, no, no. I can't.

23:24.760 --> 23:26.661
- What you think you're doing?
- I can't do it.

23:26.663 --> 23:28.796
- You can and you will.
- I can't, I'm too scared.

23:28.798 --> 23:30.297
I'll come back another day.

23:30.299 --> 23:31.732
How about Tuesday?

23:31.734 --> 23:33.133
You are jumping,
you're gonna jump now,

23:33.135 --> 23:35.036
do you understand?
Because if you do not jump,

23:35.038 --> 23:38.272
I'm going to come over there,
and as uncle Sam as my witness,

23:38.274 --> 23:41.942
I am going to fuck you
right up the ass!

23:41.944 --> 23:44.144
So...

23:44.146 --> 23:45.646
did you jump?

23:45.648 --> 23:48.486
A little at first.

23:50.021 --> 23:51.923
- Don't you love him, Alan?
- Absolutely.

23:53.590 --> 23:56.858
Nate! Nate! Come here.
You just missed a great one.

23:56.860 --> 23:57.859
Dad, can I talk to you?

23:57.861 --> 24:00.061
Wanna join us for lunch?
Your brother is here.

24:00.063 --> 24:01.829
I see that.
Can I talk to you, dad?

24:01.831 --> 24:03.898
Well,
don't you wanna join us?

24:03.900 --> 24:06.035
They've got French dip today.

24:06.037 --> 24:07.802
He's got me folding towels.

24:07.804 --> 24:09.571
I've been folding towels
all morning.

24:09.573 --> 24:10.706
You must be getting good at it.

24:10.708 --> 24:12.241
Dad,
I'm an award-winning playwright.

24:12.243 --> 24:13.976
I'm open to other ideas.

24:13.978 --> 24:16.178
Do you want me to ask Randy
if he needs some help?

24:16.180 --> 24:17.814
You want me to work
for my little brother?

24:17.816 --> 24:19.348
I'm just thinking out loud.

24:19.350 --> 24:21.092
What skills do you have?

24:22.203 --> 24:25.622
How do you think folding towels
is gonna get me back on my feet

24:25.624 --> 24:26.557
as a playwright?

24:26.559 --> 24:27.657
I think you have a problem
with discipline.

24:27.659 --> 24:30.160
That's ridiculous. I'm more
disciplined than anyone.

24:30.162 --> 24:32.796
Well, then working for Ellis
should be a breeze.

24:32.798 --> 24:33.799
Oh, so that's it?

24:34.597 --> 24:37.667
Nate, what's going on
with that upper-left molar?

24:37.669 --> 24:38.488
Nothing.

24:39.339 --> 24:41.672
What's wrong
with your upper-left molar?

24:41.674 --> 24:44.075
Nate!

24:44.077 --> 24:45.646
Hey! Hey.

24:46.379 --> 24:48.014
Hey, Nate. Hey, hey, wait up.

24:49.048 --> 24:50.748
Well, not going so well
with dad?

24:50.750 --> 24:51.818
What do you think?

24:52.783 --> 24:53.682
All right, um...

24:54.620 --> 24:56.854
Can I offer you
just a little advice?

24:56.856 --> 24:58.693
Look, as you know, I've...

24:59.627 --> 25:02.293
had some professional success.

25:02.295 --> 25:03.128
And you know why that is?

25:03.130 --> 25:04.663
Because you laughed
at dad's jokes

25:04.665 --> 25:05.897
and he gave you his business.

25:05.899 --> 25:08.966
Dad didn't give me his business,
Nate, I had a vision, okay?

25:08.968 --> 25:10.237
I saw "Homes by Bob..."

25:11.205 --> 25:12.907
becoming "Homes by Randy".

25:14.108 --> 25:17.141
You see? I made my vision
a reality.

25:17.143 --> 25:18.243
- You get what I'm saying?
- Yes.

25:18.245 --> 25:19.744
You want a gold star
for realizing

25:19.746 --> 25:21.012
mediocre ambitions?

25:21.014 --> 25:22.782
Bravo, well done.
Mission accomplished.

25:22.784 --> 25:26.284
Why do just... just belittle me?

25:26.286 --> 25:30.289
Okay? I'm trying to give you
a visualization strategy here.

25:30.291 --> 25:32.692
I'm successful, Nate,
I'm worth listening to.

25:32.694 --> 25:33.963
Is that Gilbert and Sullivan?

25:43.103 --> 25:44.837
Hey, Nate.

25:44.839 --> 25:46.739
- Hey.
- Welcome. Welcome.

25:46.741 --> 25:49.709
To the Cranberry Bog Players.

25:49.711 --> 25:51.344
We're getting ready
for our next show.

25:51.346 --> 25:54.947
Oh, this is Dee, and Helen,
and Gert,

25:54.949 --> 25:59.253
and that's Dee's daughter
Allison at the piano.

25:59.255 --> 26:00.055
Oh.

26:01.356 --> 26:04.425
Yeah. <i>The Mikado,</i> right?
I... I heard the... the music.

26:04.427 --> 26:07.127
- Nate is in theater.
- Oh.

26:07.129 --> 26:10.130
I am the costume
and set designer.

26:10.132 --> 26:12.233
Oh, are you going
traditional Japanese,

26:12.235 --> 26:14.102
or something more contemporary?

26:14.104 --> 26:15.105
Uh...

26:16.273 --> 26:17.706
traditional.

26:17.708 --> 26:19.041
- I think.
- You know, apparently

26:19.043 --> 26:22.977
the legend is, uh, that Gilbert
had the idea for <i>The Mikado</i>

26:22.979 --> 26:25.447
when a Japanese sword fell off
the wall of his office.

26:25.449 --> 26:29.217
Oh. That's fascinating.

26:29.219 --> 26:31.285
- Did you hear that, Allison?
- Yeah.

26:31.287 --> 26:34.288
- Isn't that fascinating?
- Yes, it's fascinating.

26:34.290 --> 26:37.392
My cousin Clara is in theater.
You know her?

26:37.394 --> 26:38.095
Uh...

26:39.197 --> 26:41.463
- I don't think so.
- She's a big shot.

26:41.465 --> 26:43.798
Everyone who's anyone knows her.

26:43.800 --> 26:44.866
Kroll.

26:44.868 --> 26:47.772
I've been surveying
the entire compound for you.

26:51.374 --> 26:53.209
Good day, Mrs. Stangle.

26:53.211 --> 26:55.745
Good day, Mr. Hicks.

26:55.747 --> 26:58.748
If you'll excuse us.
Come on.

26:58.750 --> 26:59.818
Excuse us.

27:02.254 --> 27:05.020
Where is that pride?
Don't you care at all

27:05.022 --> 27:06.823
- about what you do?
- You have a little thing

27:06.825 --> 27:08.294
for the white haired one, Helen,
don't you?

27:10.194 --> 27:13.162
I have tremendous respect
for Mrs. Stangle,

27:13.164 --> 27:16.098
- as I do for all the fairer sex.
- Mm-hmm.

27:17.301 --> 27:18.434
Listen, man.

27:18.436 --> 27:21.337
I don't expect this
to mean a lot to you but, uh...

27:21.339 --> 27:24.307
I went
to Harvard, and I have a Masters

27:24.309 --> 27:27.345
from the Iowa creative writing
program.

27:27.347 --> 27:28.913
Isn't there something
more appropriate

27:28.915 --> 27:30.216
I could be doing around here?

27:36.122 --> 27:39.557
Hey.
Nate, how are you?

27:39.559 --> 27:40.927
Woohoo!

27:42.928 --> 27:44.095
Hey, Nate.

27:44.097 --> 27:46.266
You should really let me look
in that mouth of yours.

28:02.416 --> 28:04.252
Mm-mm.

28:05.985 --> 28:09.020
I understand that you wrote
a wonderful play,

28:09.022 --> 28:10.125
A Crack in the Clouds.

28:11.091 --> 28:11.994
Some people liked it.

28:13.093 --> 28:14.830
Is there any way I can get
to see it?

28:16.298 --> 28:19.331
Hmm. Dad had it on video,
I think.

28:19.333 --> 28:22.836
Oh, wonderful.
Bob, where is the video?

28:22.838 --> 28:24.173
I haven't seen it for a while.

28:26.174 --> 28:27.176
Mm.

28:28.475 --> 28:29.779
Mm.

28:31.079 --> 28:33.014
Would you guys excuse me
for a minute?

28:40.255 --> 28:41.387
Where is he going?

28:41.389 --> 28:43.523
He likes to go potter
in the garage.

28:43.525 --> 28:45.259
In the middle of dinner?

28:45.261 --> 28:46.296
Sometimes.

29:04.313 --> 29:05.315
Dad?

29:07.117 --> 29:08.119
What's up?

29:09.986 --> 29:11.255
What are you doing in here?

29:12.355 --> 29:14.089
What's that noise?

29:14.091 --> 29:17.125
- Do you smell Mexican food?
- No.

29:17.127 --> 29:18.158
No, no.

29:19.595 --> 29:21.131
Your suitcase is beeping.

29:22.032 --> 29:23.001
Yeah.

29:29.172 --> 29:32.007
Dad, you're not supposed to eat
that stuff, Connie told me.

29:32.009 --> 29:34.310
- Glass houses.
- Glass houses?

29:34.312 --> 29:37.446
You don't look so fit yourself.
You could lose a few pounds.

29:37.448 --> 29:39.581
- Do you even exercise?
- Don't make this about me.

29:39.583 --> 29:41.050
I power walk.

29:41.052 --> 29:43.119
Why don't you come power walk
with me one day?

29:43.121 --> 29:44.352
- It'll do you good.
- Have you seen

29:44.354 --> 29:46.057
what people look like
when they power walk?

29:49.462 --> 29:52.595
I've been moping the floors
of the locker rooms today, dad.

29:52.597 --> 29:55.532
Is that what you want,
to have me humiliated?

29:55.534 --> 29:57.601
Isn't is enough
that I'm living here with you?

29:57.603 --> 29:59.136
That my wife has left me?

29:59.138 --> 30:01.271
This is not
about public humiliation.

30:01.273 --> 30:04.043
If it were you'd still be
a mile ahead of me.

30:04.045 --> 30:07.009
I'm just trying to help you.
Believe me.

30:07.011 --> 30:10.381
I didn't pay for you to go
to Harvard to mop floors.

30:10.383 --> 30:12.249
You could've just
as easily gone

30:12.251 --> 30:14.185
to the state school
to mop floors.

30:20.626 --> 30:22.526
- This was mom's?
- Yeah, yeah. I think so.

30:22.528 --> 30:23.596
Well, her name's on it.

30:24.497 --> 30:26.730
So you kept her suitcase...

30:26.732 --> 30:28.632
but you threw away
the priceless memento

30:28.634 --> 30:30.601
- from Pompeii.
- That thing couldn't have cost

30:30.603 --> 30:32.670
more than ten bucks
at the tchotchke store.

30:32.672 --> 30:34.373
So you do remember it.

30:34.375 --> 30:36.141
Yeah, yeah. I remember.

30:36.143 --> 30:38.446
I didn't realize
it was so significant.

31:07.509 --> 31:11.377
They're winning seven-two.
Ninth inning.

31:11.379 --> 31:14.646
But watch, they will find a way
to blow it.

31:14.648 --> 31:16.584
This closer is horrible.

31:17.685 --> 31:20.487
- Who are they playing?
- Philly.

31:20.489 --> 31:23.324
Remember how you used to hate
the Phillies?

31:23.326 --> 31:27.193
You went crazy when they traded
Dykstra and McDowell for that...

31:27.195 --> 31:28.628
What the hell
was that guy's name?

31:28.630 --> 31:30.765
- Juan Samuel.
- Juan Samuel.

31:30.767 --> 31:32.436
That was a horrible trade.

31:37.306 --> 31:38.208
This is good.

31:47.216 --> 31:48.285
Someone's smoking pot.

31:56.126 --> 31:57.328
Hawaiian Skunk?

31:58.162 --> 31:59.693
Purple Haze.

31:59.695 --> 32:01.430
I never have pegged you
for a pothead.

32:01.432 --> 32:02.500
You want to join me?

32:09.173 --> 32:10.542
I never touched this stuff.

32:11.443 --> 32:13.278
I was a good Catholic girl.

32:15.080 --> 32:17.215
I only started smoking when...

32:18.116 --> 32:19.682
I had to do the chemo.

32:19.684 --> 32:22.551
I mean, it really works well,
you know...

32:22.553 --> 32:24.119
with the nausea.

32:24.121 --> 32:25.356
You did chemotherapy?

32:26.690 --> 32:29.127
Yeah. I had breast cancer.

32:30.462 --> 32:32.761
Nothing like your mother
went through.

32:32.763 --> 32:33.797
I guess I was lucky,

32:33.799 --> 32:36.369
but it didn't seem so
at that time, you know?

32:38.536 --> 32:40.072
Anyway, that's, um...

32:40.840 --> 32:42.272
that's how I met your dad.

32:42.274 --> 32:43.706
He was volunteering
at the hospital,

32:43.708 --> 32:46.843
and every day he would come,
and...

32:46.845 --> 32:50.179
Oh, God,
he would tell me these jokes,

32:50.181 --> 32:53.684
and I would laugh and laugh,
and...

32:56.354 --> 32:58.058
I think he saved my life.

33:01.361 --> 33:05.463
- He volunteers at the hospital?
- Yeah. Every Tuesday.

33:05.465 --> 33:07.465
Anyway, that's why, you know,
I've been trying to get him

33:07.467 --> 33:08.701
to eat better because...

33:09.803 --> 33:12.236
you know, I feel
like I owe him one.

33:12.238 --> 33:13.571
And I know

33:13.573 --> 33:16.307
that he sneaks junk food
in the garage.

33:16.309 --> 33:18.813
- He won't change.
- You're probably right.

33:22.516 --> 33:25.484
You remind me of him.

33:25.486 --> 33:29.324
No, no, I mean
in a good way. In a good way.

33:31.691 --> 33:34.927
Those ladies today
were very impressed with you.

33:34.929 --> 33:38.429
- The Cranberry Bog Players?
- Yeah.

33:38.431 --> 33:39.601
Well, that's very nice.

33:41.334 --> 33:43.768
Why don't you come direct
a show?

33:43.770 --> 33:46.872
No, no. I could probably get you
a small stipend and...

33:46.874 --> 33:49.176
Look I know writing
is your thing,

33:49.178 --> 33:53.479
but God, we would be
so thrilled to have you.

33:53.481 --> 33:55.884
Oh, God.
We need leadership.

33:57.486 --> 33:58.621
Please.

34:01.523 --> 34:02.525
<i>Daddy?</i>

34:02.958 --> 34:03.860
<i>Daddy?</i>

34:04.625 --> 34:06.128
<i>Are you listening?</i>

34:06.728 --> 34:07.729
Mm-hmm.

34:09.931 --> 34:12.433
<i>You're acting weird.</i>

34:12.435 --> 34:15.203
I was just thinking
that when you talk,

34:15.205 --> 34:18.306
your mouth looks
just like your mommy's.

34:18.308 --> 34:21.775
At least, how I remember
your mommy's mouth used to look

34:21.777 --> 34:23.813
when she used to talk to me.

34:25.982 --> 34:27.884
<i>Daddy, are you all right?</i>

34:29.484 --> 34:30.884
I miss you, Gabe.

34:30.886 --> 34:32.485
<i>We need to get going,
we're invited</i>

34:32.487 --> 34:33.553
<i>to a command performance</i>

34:33.554 --> 34:35.391
<i>at the royal ballet
in Monte Carlo.</i>

34:37.927 --> 34:39.196
<i>All right, sweetie.</i>

34:40.431 --> 34:42.797
<i>That's one terrific look, Nate.
Like...</i>

34:42.800 --> 34:44.599
<i>Buddy Hackett gone to seed.</i>

34:44.601 --> 34:46.501
<i>Are you even getting
any work done there?</i>

34:46.503 --> 34:48.436
- Yes.
- <i>What?</i>

34:48.438 --> 34:49.938
It just so happens,
they've asked me

34:49.940 --> 34:51.505
to direct <i>The Mikado.</i>

34:51.507 --> 34:53.007
<i>Who... who wants you to direct?</i>

34:53.009 --> 34:56.244
- The Cranberry Bog Players.
- <i>The what?</i>

34:56.246 --> 34:58.247
The Theatre Troupe
here at the community.

34:58.249 --> 34:59.582
- <i>The old people?</i>
- Some of them

34:59.584 --> 35:03.386
- are late middle-aged, actually.
- <i>Oh, my God, Nate,</i>

35:03.388 --> 35:04.453
<i>are you joking?</i>

35:04.455 --> 35:07.022
<i>The idea is to get back
in the game,</i>

35:07.024 --> 35:08.626
<i>not to hang up your jersey.</i>

35:14.798 --> 35:16.267
- What?
- Power walk?

35:19.336 --> 35:22.773
Have you ever heard
of the Korean war?

35:22.775 --> 35:25.009
Yeah. I have. Yeah.

35:25.011 --> 35:27.344
I never know
with you young people.

35:27.346 --> 35:29.512
Let me guess,
you were in Korea?

35:29.514 --> 35:32.048
Incheon, Busan, Seoul.

35:32.050 --> 35:34.418
Even pushed across the 38th.

35:34.420 --> 35:35.822
Greatest time of my life.

35:37.322 --> 35:41.458
Every young man should go
to war. See the world.

35:41.460 --> 35:43.326
I learned a lot
from those bucket heads.

35:43.328 --> 35:45.496
Yeah, uh,
people don't really say

35:45.498 --> 35:46.930
"bucket heads" anymore.

35:46.932 --> 35:48.098
They should.

35:48.100 --> 35:51.435
- Ever seen a Korean's head?
- It's a little bit racist.

35:51.437 --> 35:53.638
You're gonna tell me
about racist?

35:53.640 --> 35:56.006
I saw a less racism
from those bucket heads

35:56.008 --> 35:57.711
than from my fellow marines.

35:59.912 --> 36:02.546
Orientals, if you prefer.

36:02.548 --> 36:03.714
Here's my point,

36:03.716 --> 36:08.385
the Koreans have a philosophy
about mundane business.

36:08.387 --> 36:10.922
You get inside the task.

36:10.924 --> 36:15.494
Make it less about the goal,
and more about the process.

36:15.496 --> 36:18.600
Maybe that's why their gals
are so good at fellatio.

36:21.469 --> 36:23.735
Don't mention that last bit
to Mrs. Stangle.

36:23.737 --> 36:25.637
I knew it. You have a thing
for Helen, don't you?

36:25.639 --> 36:27.840
She's kind of a silver fox,
that one. Kinda...

36:27.842 --> 36:29.544
kinda old-lady-hot.

36:30.578 --> 36:32.378
I've got dibs on her.

36:32.380 --> 36:33.511
You understand?

36:33.513 --> 36:35.481
If I catch you anywhere
near her,

36:35.483 --> 36:37.783
I will crush your windpipe,
believe me,

36:37.785 --> 36:39.452
I could still kick
your lame ass.

36:39.454 --> 36:41.354
Oh, whoa. Take it easy.
I'm married, okay?

36:41.356 --> 36:42.425
She's all yours.

36:43.425 --> 36:44.760
Wow.

36:49.865 --> 36:52.099
Wait, Ellis. Ellis. Ellis.
What do you mean

36:52.101 --> 36:54.401
about getting inside
the process?

36:54.403 --> 36:55.438
What? Hell.

36:56.537 --> 36:58.374
What, they'd let anyone
in Harvard?

36:59.576 --> 37:02.777
There's a lot of crappy jobs,
you see?

37:02.779 --> 37:05.580
Somebody's got to shovel shit.

37:05.582 --> 37:08.549
In America, the shit shoveler
sits there grumbling

37:08.551 --> 37:11.652
that he's too good
to shovel shit.

37:11.654 --> 37:14.822
That every shovel full of shit
is a personal upfront

37:14.824 --> 37:18.025
to who he ought to be,
what he was born to be.

37:18.027 --> 37:20.094
Now, in Asia it's different.

37:20.096 --> 37:22.064
The shit shoveler
just tries to be

37:22.066 --> 37:24.800
the best shit shoveler
he can be.

37:24.802 --> 37:27.535
And when he gets home,
he's proud.

37:27.537 --> 37:29.405
He can wash his hands
thoroughly,

37:29.407 --> 37:30.706
look his wife in the eye,

37:30.708 --> 37:33.941
and be satisfied with the day
of honest work.

37:33.943 --> 37:36.445
What if I don't want to be
a shit shoveler?

37:36.447 --> 37:37.678
You're not!

37:37.680 --> 37:39.747
You're a towel-folder.
Be happy!

37:39.749 --> 37:40.749
Shoveling shit stinks.

37:40.751 --> 37:43.084
Well, I'm not a goddamn
towel folder either.

37:43.086 --> 37:45.186
Oh, you're right about that!

37:45.188 --> 37:48.658
I've never seen
a worse towel folder.

37:48.660 --> 37:50.062
In fact, you're fired.

38:04.576 --> 38:05.444
I Googled you.

38:06.178 --> 38:08.710
You were kinda hot shit once.

38:08.712 --> 38:10.981
Well, thank you for qualifying
that statement,

38:10.983 --> 38:12.682
because I was afraid of getting
a big hit.

38:12.684 --> 38:14.651
I didn't mean it like that.

38:14.653 --> 38:16.086
My mom has this crazy idea

38:16.088 --> 38:18.722
that you're gonna
come help them with the play.

38:18.724 --> 38:21.157
Why is it so crazy?
You're helping them.

38:21.159 --> 38:22.661
Yeah, but that's different.

38:23.728 --> 38:24.630
Why?

38:25.221 --> 38:26.867
Well, I don't have
any other options.

38:34.908 --> 38:36.006
As a starting point,

38:36.008 --> 38:39.243
I thought we could have
a theoretical conversation

38:39.245 --> 38:43.047
about what Gilbert and Sullivan
were trying to do

38:43.049 --> 38:44.283
with <i>The Mikado.</i>

38:44.285 --> 38:46.685
- By setting the play in Japan...
- What are you doing?

38:46.687 --> 38:48.589
What are you digging around
in that purse? What's in there?

38:52.158 --> 38:53.892
- An opportunity...
- I would appreciate it,

38:53.894 --> 38:55.093
if you don't roll those eyes
at me.

38:55.095 --> 38:56.196
I got a responsibility here.

38:59.266 --> 39:00.535
So sorry. Go ahead.

39:03.904 --> 39:05.771
You know, let's forget theory.

39:05.773 --> 39:07.673
Let's start with the basics.

39:07.675 --> 39:10.208
How far have you all gotten
so far?

39:10.210 --> 39:11.510
Well, we...

39:11.512 --> 39:15.081
we have definitely decided
that we are doing <i>The Mikado,</i>

39:15.083 --> 39:17.115
but maybe just
the "Three Little Maids" number,

39:17.117 --> 39:19.719
- maybe not the whole thing.
- It's very long.

39:19.721 --> 39:22.990
I wanted to do "Brigadoon",
it's so romantic.

39:22.992 --> 39:25.158
I played Meg in <i>Summer Stock.</i>

39:25.160 --> 39:28.261
I would've preferred to see you
in chicken stock.

39:28.263 --> 39:29.796
<i>The Racine Journal Times</i>

39:29.798 --> 39:32.064
called my performance
"hypnotic".

39:32.066 --> 39:34.503
- You made them very sleepy.
- Yeah.

39:38.073 --> 39:41.107
Oh, now, this a clipping
from 1977?

39:41.109 --> 39:42.245
But look at the picture.

39:52.022 --> 39:55.155
Oh, yeah. It's big.

39:55.157 --> 39:58.159
So, Gabe, what are you doing
over there? Are you doing camp?

39:58.161 --> 40:01.228
- Are you doing swim lessons?
- <i>I'm doing swimming.</i>

40:01.230 --> 40:05.699
<i>I can jump in the water,
swim underwater, and cannonball.</i>

40:05.701 --> 40:08.636
You know, grandpa taught me
how to cannonball.

40:08.638 --> 40:10.305
<i>You know how to cannonball,
daddy?</i>

40:10.307 --> 40:12.677
Oh, yeah.
Just a little out of practice.

40:14.044 --> 40:16.879
Okay, we're gonna try
an improv activity

40:16.881 --> 40:19.347
called "Martian, lion, pig",

40:19.349 --> 40:21.950
and everybody chooses
a creature, uh,

40:21.952 --> 40:24.687
either a Martian, like this,
"beep-boop",

40:24.689 --> 40:27.055
or a lion.

40:27.057 --> 40:28.158
Or a pig.

40:29.994 --> 40:31.762
Does everybody understand
so far?

40:32.829 --> 40:34.029
Roar.

40:34.031 --> 40:35.734
No, Gert,
I'm still explaining it.

40:36.768 --> 40:37.803
- Gert...
- I could...

40:38.737 --> 40:39.868
take her place.

40:39.870 --> 40:41.705
Thank you. Please.

40:41.707 --> 40:43.940
Okay, now I'm gonna countdown
from three,

40:43.942 --> 40:48.177
and, uh, then everybody chooses
what creature they wanna be,

40:48.179 --> 40:49.946
and we'll see how long it takes

40:49.948 --> 40:52.915
until we all choose
the same thing.

40:52.917 --> 40:54.116
Three.

40:54.118 --> 40:55.284
Two.

40:55.286 --> 40:56.353
One.

41:01.628 --> 41:04.729
Okay. Let's try again.
You're missing out, Gert.

41:04.731 --> 41:06.731
Three, two, one.

41:10.936 --> 41:12.038
Mind if I join you?

41:12.972 --> 41:14.771
Oh, uh, yeah. Please.

41:14.773 --> 41:17.310
Nigel is a surprisingly talented
barista.

41:19.778 --> 41:20.746
So...

41:21.915 --> 41:24.216
are you happy
with your first rehearsal?

41:24.218 --> 41:26.652
I'm concentrating on process.

41:26.654 --> 41:27.655
- Oh.
- Oh.

41:28.656 --> 41:29.754
Check it out.

41:33.259 --> 41:34.962
- Cappuccino?
- Okay.

41:36.163 --> 41:38.129
I'm actually here
on a mission.

41:38.131 --> 41:42.234
My mom would like you
to come over for dinner tonight.

41:42.236 --> 41:44.236
Mm. Uh, I don't think so.

41:44.238 --> 41:47.206
Dude, I eat alone with my mom
every night.

41:47.208 --> 41:49.208
Is dinner at your dad's
really a party

41:49.210 --> 41:50.345
that you can't miss?

41:53.213 --> 41:55.014
Don't look now, but I think

41:55.016 --> 41:57.152
Helen is sort of making
goo-goo eyes at me.

41:59.253 --> 42:01.054
No, I don't think so.

42:01.056 --> 42:02.791
So, what do you say? Dinner?

42:04.092 --> 42:06.726
Come on, come on.

42:06.728 --> 42:07.762
Lasagna.

42:08.262 --> 42:10.096
- Okay.
- Okay!

42:10.098 --> 42:12.399
Hang in there, buddy.
It could be worse.

42:12.401 --> 42:14.301
They could be doing
<i>Starlight Express.</i>

42:14.303 --> 42:15.468
I'll see you at seven.

42:15.470 --> 42:16.739
Later tonight, Joe.

42:27.183 --> 42:31.350
I just wanted a moment alone
with you. I hope you don't mind.

42:31.352 --> 42:33.152
Uh, actually I'm just...

42:33.154 --> 42:36.090
You know,
it is absolutely fabulous

42:36.092 --> 42:38.226
- that you've come on board.
- Thank you, Helen.

42:38.228 --> 42:42.463
- I'll just wash my hands.
- You are so talented.

42:42.465 --> 42:45.099
Oh. No, I'm not sure you can...
you can tell...

42:45.101 --> 42:48.936
I'm a connoisseur
of talented men.

42:48.938 --> 42:51.005
- Oh.
- I just want you to know,

42:51.007 --> 42:55.443
if you ever need me to audition,
or to run lines,

42:55.445 --> 42:58.684
or to do
another improv exercise...

42:59.816 --> 43:00.952
I'm around.

43:01.818 --> 43:02.987
Let's just say...

43:04.021 --> 43:07.359
my door is always...

43:08.459 --> 43:09.727
open.

43:20.171 --> 43:21.370
Stop me
if you've heard this one.

43:21.372 --> 43:22.806
- Come in.
- Zimmerman goes

43:22.808 --> 43:24.174
to the doctor
and the doctor says,

43:24.176 --> 43:25.509
"I don't know
how to tell you this,

43:25.511 --> 43:27.110
but you've got
to stop masturbating."

43:27.112 --> 43:28.244
I've heard it.

43:28.246 --> 43:29.846
"So I can examine you."
That one?

43:29.848 --> 43:31.181
Yes, I've heard it.

43:31.183 --> 43:33.418
Gee, I... I forget
who I tell them to.

43:34.485 --> 43:35.221
Um...

43:35.920 --> 43:38.154
Ellis told me that he fired you.

43:38.156 --> 43:40.257
Uh, yes, but, dad,
here's the thing...

43:40.259 --> 43:42.391
Connie explained
that you're helping the ladies

43:42.393 --> 43:43.462
with their show.

43:44.163 --> 43:45.997
That's very good.

43:45.999 --> 43:47.564
I'm sorry I didn't think
of that.

43:47.566 --> 43:49.135
It's far more appropriate.

43:52.571 --> 43:54.138
Are you going somewhere?

44:00.046 --> 44:02.280
- Oh, look at you.
- Who is that?

44:02.282 --> 44:03.414
Who's here?

44:03.416 --> 44:05.082
It's my drug dealer, mom.

44:05.084 --> 44:06.283
You want anything
while he's here.

44:06.285 --> 44:10.288
Not funny. Not funny.
Hi. Come on in. Come on in.

44:10.290 --> 44:11.980
I'm glad you're here.

44:12.560 --> 44:14.493
- I'll take that.
- Okay.

44:14.495 --> 44:15.891
Thank you.

44:16.196 --> 44:17.672
Sit... sit down.

44:18.199 --> 44:21.465
And let me pour you
a glass of wine.

44:21.467 --> 44:22.770
You there.

44:24.471 --> 44:27.038
Yeah, that's perfect.

44:27.040 --> 44:28.273
That's a nice Chianti.

44:28.275 --> 44:31.442
And start with that lasagna,
it's hot and nice right now...

44:31.444 --> 44:33.879
Well, everything is hot,
you know, that's...

44:33.881 --> 44:35.481
yeah, just go ahead.

44:35.483 --> 44:37.483
Hey, do you want
some cranberry juice, honey?

44:37.485 --> 44:39.954
- Yeah, please.
- Okay, it's in the fridge.

44:43.023 --> 44:44.125
So...

44:44.860 --> 44:46.146
okay...

44:46.561 --> 44:50.128
here we are. Oh, goodness,
I forgot something.

44:50.130 --> 44:51.530
Uh...

44:51.532 --> 44:55.235
I just remembered.
You guys just eat and...

45:01.109 --> 45:02.578
She's up to something.

45:09.484 --> 45:11.384
You know, if you wanted
to have dinner with me,

45:11.386 --> 45:12.652
you could've just asked.

45:12.654 --> 45:15.388
- No need for this charade.
- Mm-hmm.

45:15.390 --> 45:16.292
So...

45:17.160 --> 45:19.225
tell me what's wrong with you,
again?

45:19.227 --> 45:21.228
The short version,
my wife left me

45:21.230 --> 45:22.630
and took our son,

45:22.632 --> 45:24.835
and I had no place else to go.

45:25.601 --> 45:26.903
What happened?

45:29.005 --> 45:32.106
I think when you fall in love
with someone...

45:32.108 --> 45:33.374
you're partially falling in love

45:33.376 --> 45:35.309
with the person they are
at that moment,

45:35.311 --> 45:38.449
and partially with the person
you hoped they would become.

45:40.217 --> 45:41.952
Maybe I let her down
in that regard.

45:43.153 --> 45:45.022
She kind of gave up
on the potential me.

45:47.692 --> 45:50.493
- So, what's wrong with you?
- Well...

45:50.495 --> 45:53.498
you see how my mom is with food?
Um...

45:55.033 --> 45:58.167
Well, that's how I am
with a few other things.

45:58.169 --> 46:00.404
Specifically, vodka and cocaine.

46:01.471 --> 46:04.702
I was in band
and we were...

46:05.642 --> 46:09.011
on the road an awful lot,
and I think I just took things

46:09.013 --> 46:09.983
a little too far.

46:10.481 --> 46:11.583
I got arrested.

46:12.684 --> 46:14.617
But I traded jail time
for rehab,

46:14.619 --> 46:16.987
and Dee is my halfway house.

46:16.989 --> 46:21.124
I am quite literally a prisoner
of Cranberry Bog.

46:21.126 --> 46:24.126
Oh, my God, that's so horrible.

46:24.128 --> 46:25.394
Uh...

46:25.396 --> 46:27.998
So you're kind of like
a bad girl?

46:28.000 --> 46:29.166
Well...

46:29.168 --> 46:32.436
I wouldn't say that, I mean,
I did drive a mean Harley,

46:32.438 --> 46:34.942
but, no. I'm really a musician.

46:36.042 --> 46:39.209
I wouldn't mind teaching piano
to kids.

46:39.211 --> 46:40.310
Something like that.

46:40.312 --> 46:42.013
I think once I serve my time
with Dee,

46:42.015 --> 46:44.582
I'll go to Seattle or something
and start over.

46:44.584 --> 46:46.520
- Why Seattle?
- Um...

46:47.720 --> 46:49.656
Can't get much further
from New Jersey.

47:22.591 --> 47:26.329
My door is always open.

47:31.198 --> 47:35.135
Hey. I called my cousin Clara
to see if she knows you.

47:35.137 --> 47:37.770
She's so important,
she doesn't take anyone's call.

47:37.772 --> 47:40.774
When Neil Simon calls,
she says, "I'll call him back."

47:40.776 --> 47:44.209
Stephen Sondheim calls,
she says, "I'll call him back."

47:44.211 --> 47:46.579
But when her cousin Gert calls,

47:46.581 --> 47:48.315
that call she takes.

47:48.317 --> 47:49.750
What's she saying?

47:49.752 --> 47:51.418
She's gonna call me back.

47:51.420 --> 47:53.087
Okay, well, let me know.

47:53.089 --> 47:55.589
Everybody gather around,
I've worked out the casting

47:55.591 --> 47:56.759
for our number.

47:58.326 --> 48:00.494
Now, all the parts
are good parts.

48:00.496 --> 48:02.462
So let's not get too hung up
on this,

48:02.464 --> 48:04.465
especially since we're
only doing one number.

48:06.268 --> 48:06.770
Dee...

48:08.136 --> 48:10.671
will play Yum-Yum.
That's a soprano part,

48:10.673 --> 48:13.010
and this isn't operetta, and...

48:13.843 --> 48:16.278
she's the closest.
Helen...

48:16.280 --> 48:17.582
will play Peep-Bo.

48:18.282 --> 48:19.414
That's a mezzo.

48:19.416 --> 48:22.117
And, Gert,
you can play Pitti-Sing.

48:22.119 --> 48:25.419
That's a mezzo also, but, uh,
you can sing it however you do.

48:25.421 --> 48:26.720
I don't sing.

48:26.722 --> 48:29.256
Gert, why do you always have
to be so negative?

48:29.258 --> 48:31.292
Nothing negative about it,
I don't sing.

48:31.294 --> 48:32.494
Nate...

48:32.496 --> 48:34.199
may I speak to you outside?

48:38.136 --> 48:39.737
Helen, what's going on?

48:41.573 --> 48:42.775
Helen, are you crying?

48:43.707 --> 48:46.210
You never even gave me a chance.

48:47.411 --> 48:48.247
Oh.

48:48.775 --> 48:52.147
Peep-Bo is a very good part.
We're only doing one number.

48:52.149 --> 48:53.882
I don't care about that.

48:53.884 --> 48:55.420
Oh. So, uh...

48:56.487 --> 48:57.757
what are we talking about?

49:00.126 --> 49:01.127
Nate...

49:02.360 --> 49:03.529
I'm not a fool.

49:04.863 --> 49:07.164
- I know I'm old.
- No, no, you're not.

49:07.166 --> 49:08.264
- I am.
- You're not.

49:08.266 --> 49:09.134
I am.

49:10.001 --> 49:12.168
But when a lady says her door
is open,

49:12.170 --> 49:14.204
a polite gentleman
can at least...

49:14.206 --> 49:15.539
Oh, I see.

49:15.541 --> 49:17.677
- Of course.
- Oh, it's settled then?

49:19.411 --> 49:23.281
Drinks at my place.
I'll see you at eight.

49:23.283 --> 49:24.551
Now let's rehearse.

49:26.520 --> 49:28.453
We've got a show to do.

49:28.455 --> 49:29.590
Ready, ladies?

49:32.325 --> 49:35.393
<i>Everything is a source of fun</i>

49:38.265 --> 49:41.435
<i>Nobody's safe
For we care for none</i>

49:44.471 --> 49:47.409
Life is a joke
that's just begun.

49:48.708 --> 49:52.246
<i>Life is a joke
That's just begun</i>

49:53.713 --> 49:57.251
Life is a joke
that's just begun.

50:30.252 --> 50:31.787
What do you think? Hmm?

50:34.623 --> 50:36.124
For <i>The Mikado.</i>

50:36.659 --> 50:39.659
It's Japanese.
I'm going to show Connie.

50:39.661 --> 50:40.496
Oh.

50:40.929 --> 50:42.463
Great idea.

50:42.465 --> 50:45.636
Come in. I got some sake.

50:53.409 --> 50:55.878
I like my sake cold.

50:57.314 --> 50:59.184
And my men warm.

51:00.783 --> 51:02.486
I wanna show you something,
Nate.

51:09.892 --> 51:11.892
That's Pablo Robles.

51:11.894 --> 51:14.562
He was in the import/export
business.

51:14.564 --> 51:18.466
I think he might've been
a drug dealer as well.

51:18.468 --> 51:21.436
Have you ever heard
of a courtesan?

51:21.438 --> 51:22.440
Hmm.

51:24.042 --> 51:27.677
That is Notin Shre.

51:27.679 --> 51:30.413
He was in the Burmese
governing junta.

51:30.415 --> 51:32.982
We were lovers for five years.

51:32.984 --> 51:35.987
I've spent my life
as a courtesan.

51:37.489 --> 51:40.489
I've traveled the world
as the guest of...

51:40.491 --> 51:42.293
powerful married men.

51:49.434 --> 51:52.435
I generally saw a side
of these men,

51:52.437 --> 51:55.705
that for one reason or another,
they couldn't show their wives

51:55.707 --> 51:56.443
or the world.

51:57.543 --> 52:01.611
The side of them
that was scared to fail.

52:01.613 --> 52:03.816
Or succeed for that matter.

52:04.816 --> 52:05.684
The side...

52:06.519 --> 52:08.321
that lacked confidence.

52:09.922 --> 52:10.723
I see.

52:13.826 --> 52:16.863
You could use some confidence,
Nate.

52:19.598 --> 52:20.667
You think so?

52:21.500 --> 52:22.502
Oh, yes.

52:23.636 --> 52:25.573
I know about these things.

52:30.810 --> 52:32.743
Oh, Ellis really like you.

52:32.745 --> 52:35.113
Did you know...
did you know that?

52:35.115 --> 52:37.349
I mean, it's obvious to me.

52:37.351 --> 52:38.918
But he's so old.

52:38.920 --> 52:40.352
Yeah, he's kinda old.

52:40.354 --> 52:43.691
But he's, uh, very devoted,
and...

52:44.925 --> 52:46.295
surprisingly fit.

52:47.128 --> 52:47.929
Uh...

52:49.496 --> 52:51.432
And he... you know what,
he thinks the world of you.

52:52.867 --> 52:54.666
Maybe it's time
you let someone else

52:54.668 --> 52:55.670
take care of you.

52:58.573 --> 53:00.409
I'll see you at rehearsal.

53:06.415 --> 53:07.472
Oh, Ellis.

53:07.772 --> 53:09.850
- I told you she was mine.
- Oh, no, no...

53:09.852 --> 53:12.085
- I told you I had dibs.
- It's not what it looks like.

53:12.087 --> 53:13.323
Nate.

53:14.022 --> 53:15.522
Thank you.

53:15.524 --> 53:16.757
Thank you.

53:16.759 --> 53:18.428
Oh. Hi, Ellis.

53:25.501 --> 53:27.036
Think you're fooling me?

53:38.014 --> 53:40.447
You think
you're gonna get away?

53:40.449 --> 53:42.585
I'll get you! Oh!

53:51.127 --> 53:52.928
He saw me
coming out of Helen's,

53:52.930 --> 53:55.564
I... you know, she was...
she gave me sake, she had...

53:55.566 --> 53:58.734
- What are you talking about?
- Ellis is chasing me.

53:58.736 --> 54:00.502
He's gonna crush my windpipe.

54:00.504 --> 54:01.573
Do you have another helmet?

54:03.607 --> 54:06.174
Not much muscle under the hood.

54:06.176 --> 54:09.545
Yeah, well, I figure I'd go
power walking with my dad.

54:09.547 --> 54:11.146
It's a Vespa.

54:11.148 --> 54:13.615
- Got him now!
- There he is.

54:13.617 --> 54:15.520
Shit. All right. Hold on.

54:22.494 --> 54:24.059
Come on, Kroll.

54:24.061 --> 54:26.563
I know you're hiding somewhere.

54:26.565 --> 54:28.099
I just want to talk!

54:29.733 --> 54:32.101
Kroll, take it like a man!

54:32.103 --> 54:34.171
He thinks
I was hitting on his girl.

54:34.173 --> 54:36.774
Oh, is that your thing?
You're a granny banger?

54:36.776 --> 54:39.510
I bang a lot of grannies, yeah.
I do.

54:39.512 --> 54:42.680
I mean, no... but seriously,
she's a very attractive woman.

54:42.682 --> 54:44.814
And... and, uh, I'm not...

54:44.816 --> 54:46.783
I don't think you're a dick
for not wanting to stick it

54:46.785 --> 54:47.952
to an 80-year-old.

54:47.954 --> 54:49.252
Thank you.
You're very understanding,

54:49.254 --> 54:50.957
and I appreciate it.

54:56.127 --> 54:57.929
Would you read a play
I've been working on?

54:57.931 --> 55:01.666
- Well, I'm more of a music girl.
- But you're smart.

55:01.668 --> 55:03.668
And not to be overly pathetic,

55:03.670 --> 55:07.575
but I think you might be
my only friend right now.

55:08.909 --> 55:11.576
But which Nate wants
to be friends,

55:11.578 --> 55:13.114
you or the potential you?

55:15.848 --> 55:16.850
Both.

55:21.256 --> 55:22.724
Sure, I'll read it.

55:23.791 --> 55:24.927
I'm outnumbered.

55:31.164 --> 55:33.566
- Where are you?
- <i>Geneva.</i>

55:33.568 --> 55:36.702
<i>Henri decided to go to India
on a trip, so we came here.</i>

55:36.704 --> 55:39.705
- <i>That's a bore.</i>
- Are you drinking wine in bed?

55:39.707 --> 55:41.573
<i>I'm in Europe,
it's not that weird.</i>

55:41.575 --> 55:43.709
- Yeah?
- <i>Everything's great, Nate.</i>

55:43.711 --> 55:46.980
<i>I'm building Henri's collection,
I've got a blank check.</i>

55:46.982 --> 55:49.049
<i>It's every art-doer's dream.</i>

55:49.051 --> 55:50.053
<i>Talk to your son.</i>

55:51.620 --> 55:53.886
- <i>Hi, daddy.</i>
- Hi, sweetheart.

55:53.888 --> 55:56.089
- <i>Are you smiling?</i>
- Am I?

55:56.091 --> 55:58.017
Yeah. Yeah.

55:58.560 --> 56:01.127
I had a nice evening, I guess,
and I'm glad to see you.

56:01.129 --> 56:02.563
- <i>Daddy.</i>
- Yeah?

56:02.565 --> 56:04.567
<i>Can you bark like a sea lion?</i>

56:11.675 --> 56:13.077
<i>I'm trying to sleep.</i>

56:20.215 --> 56:21.651
Yeah.

56:22.218 --> 56:23.187
Power walk?

56:25.121 --> 56:26.122
Yeah.

56:49.879 --> 56:51.846
So, Zimmerman is seeing
his doctor,

56:51.848 --> 56:54.283
and he's got a carrot
in one nostril,

56:54.285 --> 56:56.185
a string bean
in the other nostril,

56:56.187 --> 56:58.387
and asparagus spear in one ear,

56:58.389 --> 57:00.189
and a piece on celery
in the other.

57:00.191 --> 57:02.092
And the doctor says,
"I don't think

57:02.094 --> 57:03.662
you're eating properly."

57:08.166 --> 57:10.001
Dad, that is never going
to be funny.

57:11.769 --> 57:13.903
Other people think I'm funny.

57:13.905 --> 57:14.907
They're wrong.

57:15.840 --> 57:16.808
Dad.

57:18.210 --> 57:22.245
I'm thinking of taking a ride
out to mom's grave later.

57:22.247 --> 57:23.349
You wanna come?

57:26.419 --> 57:27.888
That's okay. You can go.

57:29.087 --> 57:30.156
Don't you miss mom?

57:32.290 --> 57:34.824
You know which story
reminds me most of mom?

57:34.826 --> 57:36.861
Dad, can we just talk,
does it have to be a joke?

57:36.863 --> 57:39.430
It's the one where Zimmerman
is alone

57:39.432 --> 57:41.297
shipwrecked on a desert island,

57:41.299 --> 57:45.804
<i>and all he's got with him
is a fishing rod and a dog...</i>

57:45.806 --> 57:46.743
<i>and a sheep.</i>

57:47.375 --> 57:50.909
<i>He has everything he needs
to survive.</i>

57:50.911 --> 57:52.046
<i>But he's lonely.</i>

57:53.146 --> 57:54.248
<i>Very lonely.</i>

57:56.382 --> 57:59.052
<i>The sheep is starting
to look better and better.</i>

58:00.420 --> 58:01.822
<i>But the dog...</i>

58:02.255 --> 58:04.791
<i>will have none of it.</i>

58:13.901 --> 58:17.069
<i>Zimmerman is lonelier
than ever.</i>

58:17.071 --> 58:20.073
<i>But one day he notices
something odd</i>

58:20.075 --> 58:21.941
<i>out on the horizon.</i>

58:21.943 --> 58:25.314
See that?

58:35.224 --> 58:37.257
I owe you my life.

58:37.259 --> 58:39.860
I would be dead
if it weren't for you.

58:39.862 --> 58:40.964
I would do anything.

58:42.031 --> 58:44.099
Absolutely anything
to repay you.

58:45.266 --> 58:46.335
Anything?

58:47.069 --> 58:48.402
You name it.

58:48.404 --> 58:50.273
Absolutely anything.

58:53.375 --> 58:54.811
Will you take the dog
for a walk?

58:57.012 --> 58:58.780
What does that have to do
with mom?

58:58.782 --> 59:00.147
Well, you know,
I... I never liked

59:00.149 --> 59:02.316
breaking the jokes down
too much.

59:02.318 --> 59:04.118
That pseudo intellectual stuff

59:04.120 --> 59:05.986
just takes
all the joy out of it.

59:05.988 --> 59:08.490
It's funny that the guy
would rather schtup the sheep

59:08.492 --> 59:10.524
than the beautiful young girl.

59:10.526 --> 59:12.827
That's enough for me, but mom...

59:12.829 --> 59:15.530
when mom would hear
that story...

59:15.532 --> 59:18.399
- do you know what she'd say?
- What?

59:18.401 --> 59:20.204
There's no explaining love.

59:59.945 --> 01:00:02.445
Okay. All right.
Just get it over with.

01:00:02.447 --> 01:00:05.017
Not the windpipe though, please.
Not... not the windpipe.

01:00:08.587 --> 01:00:10.554
You were just gonna take it?

01:00:10.556 --> 01:00:11.989
Don't you have any fight in you?

01:00:11.991 --> 01:00:13.156
I do.

01:00:13.158 --> 01:00:14.926
I have fight in me.

01:00:14.928 --> 01:00:16.063
I spoke to Mrs. Stangle.

01:00:18.031 --> 01:00:19.766
I don't know what you said.

01:00:22.035 --> 01:00:23.036
But thank you.

01:00:26.538 --> 01:00:31.976
One, two three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

01:00:31.978 --> 01:00:33.909
Fan snap.

01:00:34.347 --> 01:00:37.048
<i>Three little maids
From school are we</i>

01:00:37.050 --> 01:00:39.918
<i>Pert as a school-girl
Well can be</i>

01:00:39.920 --> 01:00:43.421
<i>Filled to the brim
With girlish glee</i>

01:00:43.423 --> 01:00:46.191
<i>Three little maids from school</i>

01:00:46.193 --> 01:00:48.026
- Every...
- Yeah, stop. Yeah.

01:00:48.028 --> 01:00:49.528
That was... that was...

01:00:49.530 --> 01:00:50.331
Yeah.

01:00:50.862 --> 01:00:53.497
- You've come such a long way.
- You know, I think

01:00:53.499 --> 01:00:55.968
Gert did her fan part
at the wrong time.

01:00:55.970 --> 01:00:58.004
At least I could keep a husband.

01:00:58.006 --> 01:00:59.531
Oh, uh, ladies, let's not...

01:01:00.408 --> 01:01:02.574
Let's break for today
and tomorrow.

01:01:02.576 --> 01:01:04.509
We'll work on the next section.

01:01:04.511 --> 01:01:07.212
Yeah. We're gonna get it now.
We...

01:01:07.214 --> 01:01:09.882
We're gonna get it there!
Woo!

01:01:09.884 --> 01:01:11.917
We'll never ever get it there.

01:01:11.919 --> 01:01:14.055
- Uh-huh.
- Better read that.

01:01:15.223 --> 01:01:16.922
- Script?
- Yeah.

01:01:16.924 --> 01:01:18.424
Actually, maybe I should
do some more work on it.

01:01:18.426 --> 01:01:20.026
- No, no.
- No, I'll do more work...

01:01:20.028 --> 01:01:21.195
- No, no, no.
- I can tweak it.

01:01:21.197 --> 01:01:22.496
- No tweaks.
- I could just tweak it.

01:01:22.498 --> 01:01:24.367
- No don't. No tweaks.
- Okay.

01:01:26.201 --> 01:01:27.269
Thanks.

01:03:08.507 --> 01:03:09.475
Open the glove box.

01:03:10.476 --> 01:03:14.212
Pass me <i>El Caballero Caliente.</i>

01:03:14.214 --> 01:03:17.014
- Which one is it?
- It's that one, it's green.

01:03:17.016 --> 01:03:18.018
Here.

01:03:20.185 --> 01:03:22.321
How is going with Dee,
and those guys?

01:03:22.323 --> 01:03:23.689
To be honest,

01:03:23.691 --> 01:03:25.560
they're never gonna be
very good.

01:03:27.193 --> 01:03:28.128
But, uh...

01:03:28.867 --> 01:03:32.631
I think ladies are
actually enjoying themselves.

01:03:32.633 --> 01:03:34.700
But for me,
I just wanna finish it.

01:03:34.702 --> 01:03:36.071
Just finish something.

01:03:39.073 --> 01:03:41.439
Connie is worried about you,
you know?

01:03:41.441 --> 01:03:44.777
Your health. She knows
about your little garage visits.

01:03:44.779 --> 01:03:47.047
- I figured.
- Well, then why the rules?

01:03:47.049 --> 01:03:49.148
Why not just eat
what you want inside your house?

01:03:49.150 --> 01:03:50.784
I don't wanna hurt
Connie's feelings.

01:03:50.786 --> 01:03:52.384
She's trying to take care of me.

01:03:52.386 --> 01:03:54.821
But I just don't like
that rabbit food.

01:03:54.823 --> 01:03:56.188
This stuff is gonna kill you.

01:03:56.190 --> 01:03:57.790
Zimmerman goes to see his
doctor,

01:03:57.792 --> 01:04:01.194
doctor says, "Zimmerman, you got
six months to live."

01:04:01.196 --> 01:04:04.596
Zimmerman says,
"I want a second opinion."

01:04:04.598 --> 01:04:07.366
The doctor says,
"Okay, that's an ugly haircut."

01:04:07.368 --> 01:04:09.602
So I'll check food
and your health off the list

01:04:09.604 --> 01:04:11.474
of things you're willing
to actually discuss.

01:04:14.677 --> 01:04:15.612
Dad...

01:04:16.195 --> 01:04:19.713
what happened to all of
mom's stuff from the old house?

01:04:19.715 --> 01:04:22.184
I mean, it's as if,
she never even existed.

01:04:27.856 --> 01:04:30.393
Maybe check that off your list
as well.

01:04:39.469 --> 01:04:40.835
Which... what part is this again?

01:04:40.837 --> 01:04:43.538
Come on, ladies, you wanted
to do <i>The Mikado.</i>

01:04:43.540 --> 01:04:44.409
You.

01:04:45.223 --> 01:04:47.442
Opening night is approaching
and we're not gonna be ready.

01:04:47.444 --> 01:04:49.344
Why don't we just start
over from the beginning?

01:04:49.346 --> 01:04:50.879
- My bunions hurt.
- Your bunions,

01:04:50.881 --> 01:04:52.580
your sciatica.
It's always something.

01:04:52.582 --> 01:04:54.516
Well, maybe
if I was getting schtupped

01:04:54.518 --> 01:04:57.487
right, left and sideways
by the ancient married men,

01:04:57.489 --> 01:04:59.287
I wouldn't complain so much.

01:04:59.289 --> 01:05:00.655
This is gonna be embarrassing.

01:05:00.657 --> 01:05:02.258
I don't know how to make
it work.

01:05:02.260 --> 01:05:06.394
I mean, this could either be
cute, or it could be sad.

01:05:06.396 --> 01:05:07.796
And it's teetering.

01:05:07.798 --> 01:05:09.632
It's teetering
right on the edge.

01:05:09.634 --> 01:05:12.501
- Oh, really?
- Hey, ladies.

01:05:12.503 --> 01:05:14.137
Look what I found on eBay.

01:05:14.139 --> 01:05:17.405
Nate's play.
A Crack in the Clouds.

01:05:17.407 --> 01:05:19.642
- Oh.
- We're gonna have a screening.

01:05:19.644 --> 01:05:21.777
Oh, no. I don't think
that's a great idea.

01:05:21.779 --> 01:05:24.249
Don't be silly.
It's a wonderful play.

01:05:26.919 --> 01:05:28.451
Did you just say something nice?

01:05:28.453 --> 01:05:30.486
I have high standards.

01:05:30.488 --> 01:05:32.558
Doesn't mean
I don't like anything.

01:05:34.359 --> 01:05:36.493
- Where's Bob?
- He's playing golf.

01:05:36.495 --> 01:05:38.361
- Should we wait for him?
- No.

01:05:38.363 --> 01:05:40.663
I mean, he's... he's seen it.

01:05:40.665 --> 01:05:41.667
Oh, okay.

01:05:46.907 --> 01:05:48.639
- Oh, I know her.
- Who is she?

01:05:48.641 --> 01:05:51.275
That's the, um... yeah,
that's the woman from...

01:05:51.277 --> 01:05:52.145
<i>Pancreas?</i>

01:05:52.746 --> 01:05:54.545
<i>That's a body part?</i>

01:05:54.547 --> 01:05:56.548
<i>I thought it was a train station
in London.</i>

01:05:57.684 --> 01:06:00.184
- I don't get it. I don't get it.
- I don't get it either.

01:06:00.186 --> 01:06:01.288
It's just funny.

01:06:03.290 --> 01:06:05.923
<i>Well,
I played like crap.</i>

01:06:05.925 --> 01:06:07.925
<i>What happened to you?
It's four o'clock,</i>

01:06:07.927 --> 01:06:09.794
<i>I was expecting you at two.</i>

01:06:09.796 --> 01:06:12.464
<i>That reminds me
of a story.</i>

01:06:12.466 --> 01:06:15.234
<i>Greenberg gets home
from playing golf late,</i>

01:06:15.236 --> 01:06:17.602
<i>and his wife is angry.
Did I ever tell you that one?</i>

01:06:17.604 --> 01:06:20.406
- <i>Richard, we have to talk.</i>
- <i>Sure.</i>

01:06:20.408 --> 01:06:21.476
<i>Of course.</i>

01:06:22.208 --> 01:06:24.810
<i>Greenberg comes home
and his wife says,</i>

01:06:24.812 --> 01:06:27.645
<i>"Where have you been?"
and Greenberg says,</i>

01:06:27.647 --> 01:06:28.647
<i>You're not gonna believe this."</i>

01:06:28.649 --> 01:06:29.518
<i>Honey.</i>

01:06:29.520 --> 01:06:32.751
<i>He says, "I was driving home
from the club,</i>

01:06:32.753 --> 01:06:34.721
<i>and I see a woman
with a flat tire</i>

01:06:34.723 --> 01:06:37.924
<i>on the side of the road, well,
naturally, I pull over</i>

01:06:37.926 --> 01:06:39.726
<i>to see if I can offer her
some assistance."</i>

01:06:39.728 --> 01:06:41.795
<i>I can feel myself going
with her.</i>

01:06:41.797 --> 01:06:45.532
<i>"After I changed the tire
the woman says to me,</i>

01:06:45.534 --> 01:06:48.434
<i>'It's hot.
Could I buy you a cool drink?'"</i>

01:06:48.436 --> 01:06:50.436
<i>Richard, will you please
listen to me?</i>

01:06:50.438 --> 01:06:52.174
<i>Well, one drink."</i>

01:07:00.383 --> 01:07:01.781
I never liked that joke.

01:07:01.783 --> 01:07:04.417
I never would've told that joke
to your mother.

01:07:04.419 --> 01:07:05.785
What difference does it make?

01:07:05.787 --> 01:07:07.455
That made you feel good?

01:07:07.457 --> 01:07:09.256
Having the whole world
look at that?

01:07:09.258 --> 01:07:10.557
That's your idea of talent?

01:07:10.559 --> 01:07:12.593
I guess it was my way of dealing
with mom dying.

01:07:12.595 --> 01:07:13.760
You never dealt with it.

01:07:13.762 --> 01:07:15.763
You cracked jokes
at her funeral.

01:07:15.765 --> 01:07:16.798
You threw away
everything she owned.

01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:20.002
How about I deal with things
the way I want to?

01:07:20.004 --> 01:07:21.869
Why don't you figure out
your own life?

01:07:21.871 --> 01:07:23.572
You're 40 years old!

01:07:23.574 --> 01:07:25.574
What are you doing
in my guest room?

01:07:25.576 --> 01:07:27.442
Isn't that what you should be
thinking about?

01:07:27.444 --> 01:07:29.444
My whole life, every time
I've tried to speak to you

01:07:29.446 --> 01:07:31.545
about something,
you told me a joke.

01:07:31.547 --> 01:07:33.882
You wonder why I was closer
to mom?

01:07:33.884 --> 01:07:35.417
She used to listen.

01:07:35.419 --> 01:07:37.319
You never listened to anything.

01:07:37.321 --> 01:07:39.420
The only reason why I became
a writer in the first place,

01:07:39.422 --> 01:07:42.023
was to try and get someone
to listen.

01:07:42.025 --> 01:07:43.661
That play was about mom dying.

01:07:44.695 --> 01:07:45.947
Mom dying.

01:07:46.664 --> 01:07:47.967
A lot of people were moved
by it.

01:07:49.401 --> 01:07:51.600
I was supposed to have
a very bright future.

01:07:53.338 --> 01:07:54.439
Everybody said so.

01:07:55.606 --> 01:07:56.941
You never even said one word.

01:08:00.711 --> 01:08:01.813
Because it hurt me.

01:08:06.885 --> 01:08:08.451
You're right,
I don't belong here

01:08:08.453 --> 01:08:10.888
in your guest room.
I'm not a guest.

01:08:10.890 --> 01:08:11.891
I'm just your son.

01:08:30.475 --> 01:08:31.411
Are you going somewhere?

01:08:32.379 --> 01:08:33.281
Yeah.

01:08:33.825 --> 01:08:35.479
I don't think I can be here
anymore.

01:08:35.482 --> 01:08:37.448
Where will you go?

01:08:38.585 --> 01:08:41.386
- What about <i>The Mikado?</i>
- You guys will be fine.

01:08:41.388 --> 01:08:42.987
I've taken it as far
as I can anyway.

01:08:42.988 --> 01:08:44.622
Oh, so you're just gonna quit?

01:08:44.624 --> 01:08:46.557
It's not about <i>The Mikado,</i>
okay, Connie?

01:08:46.559 --> 01:08:48.024
No, not okay.

01:08:48.027 --> 01:08:49.761
You're letting down
a lot of people.

01:08:49.763 --> 01:08:51.095
I just can't be here anymore.

01:08:51.098 --> 01:08:53.863
I need to figure out someway
to start over.

01:08:53.866 --> 01:08:57.435
You know, wherever you go,
there you are.

01:08:57.438 --> 01:08:58.937
That's something
that my mother used to say.

01:08:58.939 --> 01:09:00.138
Well,
that's a depressing thought.

01:09:00.140 --> 01:09:01.910
Do you know where my dad is?

01:09:03.577 --> 01:09:04.679
Bob!

01:09:05.912 --> 01:09:06.915
Bob!

01:09:08.750 --> 01:09:09.751
Bob!

01:09:11.419 --> 01:09:12.453
Bob?

01:09:19.926 --> 01:09:22.161
My arm feels really funny.

01:09:22.162 --> 01:09:23.599
Really, dad? Now?

01:09:29.002 --> 01:09:30.006
Dad?

01:09:41.149 --> 01:09:42.816
What did you do to him?

01:09:42.818 --> 01:09:44.818
Are you saying,
"What did you do to him?", like,

01:09:44.819 --> 01:09:47.020
what did you do to him
to make him have a heart attack?

01:09:47.022 --> 01:09:48.024
Clearly.

01:09:49.658 --> 01:09:50.661
Fuck you.

01:09:51.528 --> 01:09:53.062
Fuck me? Fuck you!

01:09:53.930 --> 01:09:55.595
I don't believe you.

01:09:55.597 --> 01:09:57.999
You know, it's one thing to have
lofty ambitions

01:09:58.001 --> 01:09:59.634
if you can
actually see them through,

01:09:59.636 --> 01:10:01.935
and maybe I'm not some
fancy New York City playwright,

01:10:01.937 --> 01:10:03.770
but at least I can make a deal.

01:10:03.772 --> 01:10:06.941
If I couldn't,
I... I couldn't feed my family.

01:10:06.943 --> 01:10:09.644
Oh, that's right, I forgot.
You can't feed your family.

01:10:14.884 --> 01:10:16.018
Hi.

01:10:16.020 --> 01:10:17.021
Hi.

01:10:23.928 --> 01:10:25.414
What the doctor say?

01:10:27.197 --> 01:10:29.230
They still don't know
if there's any brain injury

01:10:29.232 --> 01:10:32.569
that's resulted
the heart attack, induced coma.

01:10:32.571 --> 01:10:34.803
They're supposed to give
his brain a chance to heal,

01:10:34.805 --> 01:10:36.908
he should come out of it
in the next day or two.

01:10:39.109 --> 01:10:40.112
And they will see.

01:10:48.652 --> 01:10:50.253
I'll give you some space.

01:10:50.255 --> 01:10:52.689
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

01:10:54.187 --> 01:10:56.596
Your father asked me
to give this to you...

01:10:58.197 --> 01:10:59.800
if anything ever happened
to him.

01:12:59.090 --> 01:13:00.091
I'm sorry.

01:13:01.792 --> 01:13:02.794
No, you were right.

01:13:04.095 --> 01:13:06.829
I meant about the feeding
your family thing.

01:13:06.831 --> 01:13:07.798
Oh, yeah.

01:13:08.399 --> 01:13:09.964
That was kinda harsh.

01:13:09.966 --> 01:13:11.133
I'm sorry.

01:13:11.135 --> 01:13:13.001
I always thought
you were the jackass.

01:13:13.003 --> 01:13:15.073
But, I was the one
who didn't get it.

01:13:17.341 --> 01:13:20.777
Well, it's gonna happen
whether you smile or not.

01:13:20.779 --> 01:13:21.981
Might as well try to smile.

01:13:27.852 --> 01:13:32.054
Do you know dad has
a storage space for mom's stuff?

01:13:32.056 --> 01:13:32.691
Really?

01:13:33.824 --> 01:13:35.260
- Everything?
- Yeah. Everything.

01:13:36.895 --> 01:13:38.894
So... any of our stuff?

01:13:38.896 --> 01:13:42.032
Yeah, uh,
all your little league trophies.

01:13:42.034 --> 01:13:45.002
Tickets stubs from Met's games.

01:13:45.004 --> 01:13:46.936
The board game we invented.

01:13:46.938 --> 01:13:48.706
Warming our way
through the big apple.

01:13:48.708 --> 01:13:49.939
No way.

01:13:49.941 --> 01:13:52.877
I didn't realize he cared
about any of that.

01:13:52.879 --> 01:13:53.880
Yeah.

01:13:54.981 --> 01:13:55.983
Here.

01:13:57.016 --> 01:13:58.248
Check it out.

01:13:58.250 --> 01:13:59.252
Oh.

01:14:04.123 --> 01:14:05.025
Um...

01:14:06.392 --> 01:14:09.360
You know what, you should...
you should come over...

01:14:09.362 --> 01:14:11.829
later... whatever... sometime.

01:14:11.831 --> 01:14:14.167
Just to hang out with the kids.

01:14:16.236 --> 01:14:17.872
Yeah, sure.

01:14:19.372 --> 01:14:20.375
Which one is this?

01:14:22.209 --> 01:14:23.211
No clue.

01:14:32.252 --> 01:14:33.255
How's your dad?

01:14:34.154 --> 01:14:35.420
Uh.

01:14:35.422 --> 01:14:36.391
Hard to say.

01:14:39.094 --> 01:14:41.227
Connie said you were quitting
the show.

01:14:41.229 --> 01:14:43.096
Yeah. I was
just thinking of taking off,

01:14:43.098 --> 01:14:47.066
but now that my dad is a mess,
I don't know what I'll do.

01:14:47.068 --> 01:14:48.901
I don't know what to do
with that number anyway.

01:14:48.903 --> 01:14:50.369
So that's what it's about?

01:14:50.371 --> 01:14:51.603
Fear of failing?

01:14:51.605 --> 01:14:54.240
You... you know we're talking
about The Cranberry Bog Players,

01:14:54.242 --> 01:14:55.742
- right?
- Listen, Allison,

01:14:55.744 --> 01:14:58.746
my wife left me, my kid is gone.

01:14:58.748 --> 01:15:01.415
My mom is dead,
and my dad is in a coma.

01:15:01.417 --> 01:15:03.317
I just don't think
"Three Little Maids"

01:15:03.319 --> 01:15:04.785
is the most important thing
right now.

01:15:04.787 --> 01:15:05.422
I know.

01:15:06.389 --> 01:15:08.358
You giving up
is the most important thing.

01:15:11.961 --> 01:15:13.096
I read Pompeii.

01:15:14.963 --> 01:15:17.531
- Oh, yeah?
- I thought it was beautiful.

01:15:17.533 --> 01:15:18.968
And sad.

01:15:20.102 --> 01:15:22.138
And almost finished.

01:15:23.106 --> 01:15:25.142
So, why don't you finish it?

01:15:26.409 --> 01:15:28.076
I'll tell you something...

01:15:28.078 --> 01:15:29.344
I don't think it was your wife

01:15:29.346 --> 01:15:31.115
who gave up
on the potential you.

01:15:32.915 --> 01:15:33.950
I just think it was you.

01:15:56.941 --> 01:15:58.744
You seem lost.

01:15:59.442 --> 01:16:01.042
How can I help you?

01:16:01.044 --> 01:16:02.197
I understand you can

01:16:02.914 --> 01:16:06.081
- contact the dead.
- I do have the gift.

01:16:06.083 --> 01:16:09.285
Of course, the deceased
must be open to it.

01:16:09.287 --> 01:16:11.053
I lost my father recently,

01:16:11.055 --> 01:16:13.392
and I'd like to speak to him
if it's possible.

01:16:15.394 --> 01:16:16.462
Hold my hand.

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:26.535
Immortal souls. Immortal souls!

01:16:26.537 --> 01:16:29.172
Grant us entry.

01:16:29.174 --> 01:16:30.176
Mister...

01:16:32.011 --> 01:16:34.378
- Zimmerman.
- Mr. Zimmerman

01:16:34.380 --> 01:16:37.514
needs to speak with his father.

01:16:37.516 --> 01:16:41.087
Let him speak to his father.

01:16:57.137 --> 01:16:58.039
Yes?

01:16:58.372 --> 01:16:59.374
Dad?

01:17:00.274 --> 01:17:01.473
Dad?

01:17:01.475 --> 01:17:02.443
Is that you?

01:17:03.043 --> 01:17:04.309
It is.

01:17:04.311 --> 01:17:05.282
It's me.

01:17:06.079 --> 01:17:09.648
- Hello, my son.
- Dad. Dad.

01:17:09.650 --> 01:17:10.983
You went to suddenly,

01:17:10.985 --> 01:17:13.585
there's so much I wanted
to tell you.

01:17:13.587 --> 01:17:15.653
How are you?
How is it where you are?

01:17:15.655 --> 01:17:18.456
Oh, son, it's wonderful,
wonderful!

01:17:18.458 --> 01:17:21.027
Every morning I wake up
and have a little breakfast,

01:17:21.029 --> 01:17:23.328
then I have sex.
Then I take a nap,

01:17:23.330 --> 01:17:25.597
then I have lunch.
Then I have sex.

01:17:25.599 --> 01:17:28.100
Then I take a little nap,
then I have dinner,

01:17:28.102 --> 01:17:31.570
have sex, go to bed.
Every day is like this.

01:17:31.572 --> 01:17:34.274
- It's wonderful.
- Oh, dad.

01:17:34.276 --> 01:17:37.109
Dad, I'm so happy! You made it!

01:17:37.111 --> 01:17:38.411
You're in heaven.

01:17:38.413 --> 01:17:39.979
Heaven? What heaven?

01:17:39.981 --> 01:17:41.550
I'm a bull in Montana.

01:17:44.954 --> 01:17:45.956
Dad?

01:17:47.188 --> 01:17:48.555
You won't believe this.

01:17:48.557 --> 01:17:52.125
I told him a joke and I think
he smiled a little.

01:17:52.127 --> 01:17:53.927
I don't believe it.

01:17:53.929 --> 01:17:56.096
You told him a joke?

01:17:56.098 --> 01:17:57.133
You know any jokes?

01:17:58.634 --> 01:17:59.636
Yeah.

01:18:01.036 --> 01:18:02.037
Um...

01:18:04.240 --> 01:18:06.606
These two old ladies
are talking...

01:18:06.608 --> 01:18:11.579
one says, "Oh, dear God,
it's Friday, I hate Friday."

01:18:11.581 --> 01:18:14.348
So the other lady says,
"Why do you hate Friday?"

01:18:14.350 --> 01:18:17.218
The first lady says,
"Because on Friday,

01:18:17.220 --> 01:18:19.187
my husband
always brings me flowers."

01:18:19.189 --> 01:18:21.990
So the other lady says,
"What's wrong with that?"

01:18:21.992 --> 01:18:23.258
So, the first lady says,

01:18:23.260 --> 01:18:25.360
"When my husband
brings me flowers,

01:18:25.362 --> 01:18:28.663
I always end up on my back
with my legs in the air."

01:18:28.665 --> 01:18:32.169
So the other lady says,
"What, you don't have a vase?"

01:18:37.275 --> 01:18:40.646
Look. Oh, God.

01:19:01.400 --> 01:19:02.402
Dad?

01:19:05.704 --> 01:19:06.673
Dad?

01:19:09.441 --> 01:19:11.077
What did the doctor say?

01:19:18.116 --> 01:19:20.321
He said you've got
to stop masturbating.

01:19:21.687 --> 01:19:23.156
So he can examine you.

01:19:36.169 --> 01:19:37.668
How's Bob doing today?

01:19:38.383 --> 01:19:42.507
Good. He walked down the hall,
had all the nurses in stitches.

01:19:43.510 --> 01:19:45.546
I don't think he's lost
a single punchline.

01:19:46.781 --> 01:19:48.315
He actually gave me an idea.

01:19:53.287 --> 01:19:54.289
Can I come in?

01:20:00.126 --> 01:20:02.160
How about...
about over here?

01:20:02.162 --> 01:20:04.562
It seems like a good spot.
Can you help with the...

01:20:04.564 --> 01:20:06.401
All right, it's fine,
you just... Thank you.

01:20:08.770 --> 01:20:10.106
Why would I have three?

01:20:16.511 --> 01:20:19.411
What the hell is C.C. Rudin
doing here?

01:20:19.413 --> 01:20:21.180
My cousin Clara!

01:20:21.182 --> 01:20:23.450
I told you she was a big deal.

01:20:23.452 --> 01:20:26.419
- Oh, my God. Jesus Christ...
- Oh, no, no. Don't worry.

01:20:26.421 --> 01:20:28.720
Don't worry, I'm gonna sing.

01:20:28.722 --> 01:20:30.225
Just for you.

01:20:32.395 --> 01:20:33.497
Great. Great.

01:20:59.889 --> 01:21:02.556
<i>Three little maids from school
Are we</i>

01:21:02.558 --> 01:21:05.226
<i>Pert as a school-girl
Well can be</i>

01:21:05.228 --> 01:21:08.529
<i>Filled to the brim
With girlish glee</i>

01:21:08.531 --> 01:21:10.465

01:21:10.467 --> 01:21:13.268

01:21:15.638 --> 01:21:18.206
<i>Nobody's safe
For we care for none</i>

01:21:20.777 --> 01:21:23.314
<i>Life is a joke
That's just begun</i>

01:21:25.383 --> 01:21:27.586
What did you say, Pitti-Sing?

01:21:31.356 --> 01:21:34.526
<i>Life is a joke
That's just begun</i>

01:21:41.299 --> 01:21:43.267
That's what I though you said.

01:21:45.203 --> 01:21:48.237
- Tell me, Peep-Bo.
- Yes, Yum-Yum?

01:21:48.239 --> 01:21:50.240
Have you been
to the market lately?

01:21:50.242 --> 01:21:52.875
I remember when we used to go
to the green grocer,

01:21:52.877 --> 01:21:55.279
and I could get a cucumber.

01:21:55.281 --> 01:21:59.415
This long and that thick,
for a nickel.

01:21:59.417 --> 01:22:00.784
You are not kidding.

01:22:00.786 --> 01:22:03.587
And onions are so small
these days.

01:22:03.589 --> 01:22:07.825
I used to get a pair of onions
this big for a penny a piece.

01:22:07.827 --> 01:22:11.329
I can't hear a word
you two are saying.

01:22:11.331 --> 01:22:13.831
But I remember that guy.

01:22:16.669 --> 01:22:19.370
<i>Three little maids
Who all unwary</i>

01:22:19.372 --> 01:22:21.872
<i>Come from a ladies' seminary</i>

01:22:21.874 --> 01:22:24.444
<i>Freed from its genius tutelary</i>

<i>Three little maids from school</i>

<i>Three little maids from school</i>

01:22:37.557 --> 01:22:39.792
- Yum-Yum.
- Yes, Pitti-Sing?

01:22:39.794 --> 01:22:41.859
You know, I'm just back
from Florida?

01:22:41.861 --> 01:22:45.464
- Oh, did you have a nice time?
- For the most part.

01:22:45.466 --> 01:22:47.933
Except for one day.

01:22:47.935 --> 01:22:51.703
Two friends and I accidentally
went to a nude beach.

01:22:51.705 --> 01:22:52.938
- You didn't!
- We did!

01:22:52.940 --> 01:22:54.439
- You didn't!
- We did!

01:22:54.441 --> 01:22:56.976
And a naked man came up to us.

01:22:56.978 --> 01:22:58.345
- He didn't!
- He did!

01:22:58.347 --> 01:23:00.312
- He didn't!
- He did!

01:23:00.314 --> 01:23:02.815
My first friend took one look
at him,

01:23:02.817 --> 01:23:05.784
and right away had a stroke.

01:23:05.786 --> 01:23:08.520
My second friend took one look
at him,

01:23:08.522 --> 01:23:11.690
- and right away had a stroke.
- Oh my goodness,

01:23:11.692 --> 01:23:13.360
what did you do?

01:23:13.362 --> 01:23:14.560
Me?

01:23:14.562 --> 01:23:16.829
I wouldn't touch that thing.

01:23:18.700 --> 01:23:20.671
<i>Three little maids from school</i>

01:23:25.907 --> 01:23:28.942
- So tell me, Peep-Bo.
- Yes, Yum-Yum?

01:23:28.944 --> 01:23:31.646
Do you still get horny?

01:23:31.648 --> 01:23:34.514
- I sure do.
- So, what do you do about it?

01:23:34.516 --> 01:23:37.584
Well, I just suck a lifesaver.

01:23:37.586 --> 01:23:38.852
Really?

01:23:38.854 --> 01:23:40.590
Who drives you to the beach?

01:24:28.940 --> 01:24:32.379
- Oh, that was so good.
- Thank you.

01:24:50.795 --> 01:24:51.798
Nicely done.

01:24:57.970 --> 01:24:59.874
There's somebody outside
to see you.

01:25:07.581 --> 01:25:08.382
Nirit.

01:25:08.948 --> 01:25:10.548
Oh, nice job, Nate.

01:25:10.550 --> 01:25:12.720
Bit of a departure.
Fun though.

01:25:14.080 --> 01:25:15.356
What are you doing here?

01:25:16.656 --> 01:25:19.924
It's so boring.
Henri dumped me.

01:25:19.926 --> 01:25:22.460
He went on an investment trip
to Mumbai,

01:25:22.462 --> 01:25:24.964
and brought back a 19-year-old
Indian supermodel

01:25:24.966 --> 01:25:26.464
named Karma.

01:25:26.466 --> 01:25:28.133
No, wait. You're shitting me.

01:25:28.135 --> 01:25:29.570
- No.
- Her name is "Karma"?

01:25:34.542 --> 01:25:37.008
- I'm sorry.
- Don't cry for me.

01:25:37.010 --> 01:25:40.446
I sold him 60 million in art
at a very favorable commission.

01:25:40.448 --> 01:25:43.015
I'll be staying
at the Four Season in the city.

01:25:43.017 --> 01:25:45.788
My lawyer will be in touch
about shared custody.

01:25:48.824 --> 01:25:50.660
- Did you lose some weight?
- Uh...

01:25:52.093 --> 01:25:54.760
I don't know maybe a little.

01:25:54.762 --> 01:25:55.765
Hmm.

01:26:01.904 --> 01:26:04.537
Hey, sweetie pie. Dad's here,
do you wanna see Dad?

01:26:04.539 --> 01:26:05.541
Yeah.

01:26:07.776 --> 01:26:10.513
Daddy!

01:26:16.018 --> 01:26:17.020
Oh, look.

01:26:19.021 --> 01:26:20.654
Grandpa!

01:26:22.892 --> 01:26:24.926
- These are for the author.
- For me?

01:26:24.928 --> 01:26:27.528
- Yes.
- Oh, amazing.

01:26:27.530 --> 01:26:28.599
Um...

01:26:30.066 --> 01:26:31.669
I like this potential you.

01:26:32.570 --> 01:26:34.502
I think he's got potential.

01:26:34.504 --> 01:26:36.440
- Whoa!
- Don't fall.

01:26:37.241 --> 01:26:38.643
I want you to meet my son.

01:26:39.710 --> 01:26:40.712
Okay.

01:26:54.491 --> 01:26:55.861
Okay, let's go, Gabe.

01:27:01.198 --> 01:27:02.598
Hey, Nate.

01:27:02.600 --> 01:27:03.736
What do you think?

01:27:04.413 --> 01:27:07.136
Connie and I are working
on a new idea for our next show.

01:27:21.654 --> 01:27:22.622
Morning, soldiers.

01:27:29.729 --> 01:27:31.565
- Have you seen my dad?
- Pool.

01:27:35.568 --> 01:27:36.670
Gabe, Come on.

01:27:43.744 --> 01:27:44.812
Grandpa!

01:27:55.856 --> 01:27:56.791
You ready?

01:27:59.759 --> 01:28:01.262
