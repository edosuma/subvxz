WEBVTT

00:10.010 --> 00:11.636
All metals are under quarantine.

00:11.720 --> 00:13.555
That means rings, that means studs,

00:13.638 --> 00:16.349
that means your glasses,
even if they just have metal hinges.

00:16.433 --> 00:18.393
All metal. No exceptions.

00:18.476 --> 00:19.769
Your equipment goes in the bag...

00:19.853 --> 00:21.271
They're not letting Jupiters land.

00:21.354 --> 00:23.189
Everyone's being pulled up with ziplines.

00:23.273 --> 00:24.441
Better safe than sorry.

00:24.524 --> 00:27.027
Yeah, I'm the one who's going to be sorry.
These things ride all--

00:27.110 --> 00:28.153
Yup. I got it.

00:28.403 --> 00:30.155
It's like the planet declared war
on machines.

00:30.238 --> 00:32.032
As a mechanic, I take that personally.

00:40.874 --> 00:44.002
<i>Please follow</i>
<i>level three decontamination procedure.</i>

00:50.550 --> 00:53.511
Can I open my eyes yet? Aagh!

00:54.262 --> 00:56.306
<i>Decontamination complete.</i>

00:56.389 --> 00:57.474
I asked for that.

00:57.974 --> 00:58.808
Ugh!

00:59.476 --> 01:01.895
Mm, sweet, sweet recycled air.

01:04.189 --> 01:06.107
-My knee!
- Are you all right?

01:06.191 --> 01:07.609
What happened? Are you okay?

01:09.027 --> 01:10.653
- Okay, easy, easy, easy.

01:11.154 --> 01:14.032
I don't know. Something just popped.

01:14.115 --> 01:14.949
Hey, West.

01:15.033 --> 01:16.326
Oh! Not the face.

01:18.036 --> 01:19.996
I haven't had a Cuban in almost a year.

01:20.747 --> 01:21.664
Still in business?

01:23.083 --> 01:27.337
Uh, well, Andre, we aren't exactly
in a currency-based economy these days.

01:29.798 --> 01:30.632
What do you got?

01:31.925 --> 01:33.593
Your patella has an old fracture.

01:33.676 --> 01:35.428
I was in an accident ten years ago.

01:35.512 --> 01:36.930
There's four pins in there.

01:37.222 --> 01:38.264
Strange.

01:38.640 --> 01:40.350
I don't see any pins on your scan.

01:41.851 --> 01:42.852
Impossible.

01:42.977 --> 01:44.145
Check again.

01:44.229 --> 01:45.271
I'm telling you.

01:45.355 --> 01:47.440
Whatever was there before, it's gone now.

01:56.783 --> 01:58.201
What's wrong with the floor?

01:59.494 --> 02:00.703
I think there's a hole in it.

02:00.787 --> 02:02.247
- What's going on?
-Stop!

02:02.330 --> 02:03.915
<i>HellStrike compromised.</i>

02:03.998 --> 02:06.417
<i>Please evacuate the area immediately.</i>

02:08.628 --> 02:10.046
<i>HellStrike compromised.</i>

02:10.255 --> 02:12.048
<i>Stand clear. Doors closing.</i>

02:18.138 --> 02:20.723
What the heck is happening here?

02:41.286 --> 02:42.287
So...

02:42.495 --> 02:44.372
if the Chariots are all quarantined,

02:44.455 --> 02:46.833
does that mean we're gonna walk
across the desert?

02:46.916 --> 02:48.042
Is that a problem?

02:48.835 --> 02:50.336
Uh, no. I mean...

02:51.838 --> 02:52.714
No, it's fine.

02:54.382 --> 02:55.466
Will...

02:55.550 --> 02:58.970
do I look like the kind of guy that
would drag my backside 60 miles on foot?

03:07.395 --> 03:08.563
Sent over from base camp.

03:08.646 --> 03:09.731
Hello, Mr. Adler.

03:10.815 --> 03:11.649
Hey.

03:11.733 --> 03:12.734
This one's yours.

03:12.817 --> 03:14.652
-Hello.
- Thank you.

03:14.777 --> 03:15.945
Aren't you beautiful.

03:17.530 --> 03:18.823
Just like at Grandma's.

03:19.449 --> 03:22.410
Yeah, except you never let me have
my own horse 'cause I was too little.

03:22.493 --> 03:25.580
Well, now you've not only got a horse,
you've got a robot.

03:25.663 --> 03:26.998
What do you say we go find him?

03:28.166 --> 03:31.127
<i>So you come all the way</i>
<i>down here and you don't say hello?</i>

03:31.211 --> 03:32.337
John,

03:32.462 --> 03:33.880
<i>Judy told me what happened,</i>

03:33.963 --> 03:36.591
but you're getting bandaged up now, right?
Are you okay?

03:36.674 --> 03:39.052
Well, I, uh, I will be soon.

03:39.135 --> 03:40.970
<i> Okay, well,</i>
<i>you've got a good doctor.</i>

03:41.054 --> 03:42.847
-Hey, Dad.
<i>-</i> <i>Well, hey.</i>

03:42.931 --> 03:44.682
Where are you guys now?

03:44.766 --> 03:47.018
If you're gonna go and get the robot,
I want to be with ya.

03:47.101 --> 03:49.812
Uh, no. You're not going anywhere
except for the <i>Resolute.</i>

03:49.896 --> 03:52.273
Listen, we're all right
and we're not alone.

03:52.357 --> 03:53.733
Adler's here with us.

03:54.442 --> 03:55.443
Hey, John.

03:56.069 --> 03:56.903
It's Ben.

03:56.986 --> 03:58.947
<i>Listen, I lived down here</i>
<i>for seven months.</i>

03:59.030 --> 04:00.907
This place has nothing
I haven't already seen.

04:01.616 --> 04:02.450
And trust me...

04:02.951 --> 04:05.411
I wouldn't bring your family anywhere
I wouldn't bring my own.

04:05.536 --> 04:06.371
Hey, Will.

04:07.413 --> 04:08.790
Take good care of your mom.

04:08.873 --> 04:10.750
Make sure she doesn't do anything crazy.

04:11.834 --> 04:14.170
Says the guy with the hole in his side.

04:14.420 --> 04:15.296
Fair point.

04:16.839 --> 04:17.799
I love you.

04:19.550 --> 04:20.510
I love you.

04:29.227 --> 04:30.103
First time?

04:30.395 --> 04:32.689
Uh, no. It's just been awhile.

04:33.189 --> 04:34.440
How long's awhile?

04:34.524 --> 04:35.900
Uh, forty years or so.

04:35.984 --> 04:37.652
-I'm kidding.

04:38.236 --> 04:40.238
As you can imagine
I've been kind of

04:40.780 --> 04:41.698
locked away.

04:41.948 --> 04:44.575
Let's get you unlocked.
We don't have much daylight left.

04:44.659 --> 04:46.202
Should make tracks while we can.

04:46.286 --> 04:47.662
Come on.

05:02.635 --> 05:03.720
You can stop looking.

05:03.803 --> 05:05.805
The only way out of here's
the hallway of death.

05:05.888 --> 05:08.266
Look, we're not on some random planet
with no supplies.

05:08.349 --> 05:09.934
This is the <i>Resolute.</i>

05:10.018 --> 05:12.020
We've got every piece of equipment
you can think of

05:12.103 --> 05:15.315
and we're crewed by the best engineers
that Earth has to offer,

05:15.398 --> 05:18.359
so right now, they're probably just
figuring a way to get us out of here.

05:18.443 --> 05:22.447
We're just curious as to what that way out
might be is all.

05:22.947 --> 05:23.906
There's no "we."

05:24.741 --> 05:27.368
We might be in this together,
but we are not friends.

05:27.618 --> 05:29.662
Come on,
after everything we've been through,

05:29.746 --> 05:31.164
you're practically my niece.

05:31.247 --> 05:32.248
That's so gross.

05:32.749 --> 05:34.709
<i>This is Captain Kamal speaking.</i>

05:34.792 --> 05:36.210
<i>How are you all holding up in there?</i>

05:36.294 --> 05:38.880
- We're good, ma'am.
-Yeah, but we could be better...

05:40.423 --> 05:41.257
Ma'am.

05:41.341 --> 05:43.343
It appears a corrosive contaminant

05:43.426 --> 05:45.511
has somehow made its way here
from the planet

05:45.595 --> 05:46.763
and infected the ship.

05:46.846 --> 05:50.433
Our scientists are working to stop it
before it spreads any farther.

05:50.516 --> 05:51.726
But in the meantime,

05:51.809 --> 05:54.645
we've got a team cutting their way
through to you as we speak.

05:55.104 --> 05:58.441
They're creating an evacuation route
through the circulation ducts.

05:58.524 --> 05:59.984
We hope to have you out shortly.

06:00.401 --> 06:02.904
<i>So go back to the classroom</i>
<i>and sit tight.</i>

06:02.987 --> 06:04.155
<i>They'll meet you there.</i>

06:04.238 --> 06:05.365
See?

06:05.448 --> 06:07.408
I told you. They are on it.

06:07.492 --> 06:09.243
I guess there's nothing for us to do
but wait.

06:09.327 --> 06:12.538
My mom used to say,
"Waiting to be rescued is just...

06:13.539 --> 06:14.916
planning your own funeral."

06:14.999 --> 06:16.501
She sounds like a delightful lady.

06:16.584 --> 06:20.338
My point is, everyone starts off
with the best of intentions, but...

06:21.923 --> 06:23.883
you don't always finish with them.

06:24.550 --> 06:25.885
A, B, C...

06:26.552 --> 06:29.222
for cigars. Sure.

06:31.391 --> 06:32.850
Come on.

06:35.686 --> 06:36.771
More filters.

06:38.731 --> 06:41.651
<i>All second shift workers</i>
<i>report to Cargo Deck B.</i>

06:48.533 --> 06:50.201
- <i>Why are we stopping?</i>

06:50.743 --> 06:52.328
Just like a desert on Earth.

06:54.914 --> 06:56.999
When the sun goes down, you pitch camp;

06:57.542 --> 06:59.043
start up again in the morning.

06:59.127 --> 07:01.129
But we know where the robot is now.

07:01.462 --> 07:03.881
If he leaves,
we'll have no idea where to look.

07:03.965 --> 07:05.258
I want to find him too, Will,

07:05.341 --> 07:07.593
but your mom's right on this one.
Safety first.

07:09.554 --> 07:11.556
Will, why don't you take the horses?

07:11.639 --> 07:13.015
Fine.

07:13.516 --> 07:15.059
-Got 'em?
-Yeah.

07:18.146 --> 07:19.147
You know, a year ago

07:19.355 --> 07:21.816
he would have been the first one
wanting to stop,

07:21.899 --> 07:23.025
and now he's...

07:23.109 --> 07:24.444
They do that.

07:25.236 --> 07:26.737
Since the <i>Resolute </i>launched

07:26.946 --> 07:29.365
I've seen my sons, what,
one week out of every three months.

07:29.449 --> 07:31.826
Like they're completely different
people every time I visit.

07:31.909 --> 07:34.495
I had a hard time changing schools
when I was a kid.

07:35.246 --> 07:37.165
We're asking them to change worlds.

07:39.375 --> 07:42.086
With what we know now and all
that's happened, would you do it again?

07:42.503 --> 07:43.337
Leave Earth?

07:43.629 --> 07:44.464
Yeah.

07:44.547 --> 07:45.381
I would.

07:46.757 --> 07:48.050
Really? Why is that?

07:49.093 --> 07:51.637
Because we're better now
than before we got lost.

07:55.850 --> 07:58.519
Will, are you talking
about your dad and I?

07:59.770 --> 08:00.771
Everyone.

08:00.855 --> 08:02.190
Judy, Penny.

08:03.232 --> 08:04.484
Even Don.

08:05.359 --> 08:07.403
-<i> Ready for activation.</i>

08:07.487 --> 08:08.988
If we hadn't left Earth,

08:09.238 --> 08:10.907
I would never have met the robot.

08:11.491 --> 08:13.034
Then I'd still be scared,

08:13.618 --> 08:14.744
the way I used to be.

08:15.661 --> 08:17.955
Will, the robot didn't make you brave.

08:18.122 --> 08:19.457
You did that all by yourself.

08:19.540 --> 08:20.374
How?

08:21.083 --> 08:22.376
By growing up.

08:22.960 --> 08:24.253
But it wasn't just us.

08:25.129 --> 08:26.464
The robot changed, too.

08:26.547 --> 08:28.382
If we hadn't crashed on that planet,

08:28.466 --> 08:30.468
if we hadn't met him first...

08:32.136 --> 08:34.263
who knows what would have happened
to everyone?

08:36.432 --> 08:38.184
So maybe it's good that we're here.

08:39.519 --> 08:41.145
<i>We should not be here.</i>

08:41.687 --> 08:43.439
If our parents had never
made us go to school,

08:43.523 --> 08:45.775
-none of this would have happened.
- Technically,

08:45.858 --> 08:48.611
yeah, it would have still happened,
just not to us.

08:50.446 --> 08:51.280
What are you doing?

08:52.323 --> 08:55.409
If someone's coming to get us,
we should be able to hear them by now.

08:55.493 --> 08:57.578
-Takes time. This is a big ship.
-Wait.

08:58.454 --> 08:59.288
Quiet.

09:01.874 --> 09:02.917
Noises.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.252
They must be close.

09:05.545 --> 09:09.006
Bridge, entering Tunnel H, Junction 6-2.

09:09.882 --> 09:11.175
Looks good back here.

09:18.391 --> 09:19.225
Chief.

09:19.308 --> 09:20.726
<i>Got cracks in here, too.</i>

09:20.810 --> 09:22.812
Get out of there, now.
Seal it up behind you.

09:22.895 --> 09:25.106
Angela, do we know what it is
we're dealing with yet?

09:25.189 --> 09:29.193
Some kind of self-perpetuating
subatomic oxidizing catalyst.

09:29.902 --> 09:33.406
Current application of an ammonium
counter-agent shows some progress.

09:33.614 --> 09:37.201
The problem is we can't produce it
fast enough to stop the spread.

09:37.285 --> 09:39.412
Is there another route
into that classroom?

09:39.745 --> 09:40.830
We can try.

09:41.330 --> 09:42.707
If this virus or whatever it is

09:42.790 --> 09:45.751
jumps to the <i>Resolute's</i> OGS module,
we'll lose life support.

09:45.876 --> 09:48.045
If we lose life support, we lose the ship.

09:49.839 --> 09:51.841
We need to prepare
for a worst-case scenario.

09:56.429 --> 09:57.388
The sound stopped.

09:58.097 --> 09:59.265
Something must have happened.

09:59.348 --> 10:01.976
Okay, look, my father knows these people.

10:02.059 --> 10:04.353
He's had dinner with Captain Kamal, so...

10:05.646 --> 10:07.940
-if she knows I'm here...
-Wait, that's it. Your dad--

10:08.024 --> 10:11.152
His code can access all the emergency
channels on the <i>Resolute, </i>right?

10:11.235 --> 10:12.153
I guess so.

10:12.236 --> 10:13.904
We can listen in,
find out what's going on.

10:13.988 --> 10:15.573
I don't think
this is appropriate.

10:15.656 --> 10:16.657
I agree.

10:17.867 --> 10:18.743
Although...

10:19.619 --> 10:21.329
it would be for the greater good.

10:22.538 --> 10:24.498
Perhaps just this once
we could look the other way.

10:24.582 --> 10:27.168
Okay, look, we just need to have faith
in the chain of command.

10:30.296 --> 10:32.465
Vijay, tell me. Where are your parents?

10:32.548 --> 10:35.217
On the planet,
helping to facilitate resource management.

10:35.301 --> 10:37.845
Penny, are there any other Robinsons
on board?

10:38.346 --> 10:39.221
No.

10:41.515 --> 10:43.392
The sad truth of our situation is

10:43.559 --> 10:45.936
there's not one person left on the ship

10:46.228 --> 10:47.563
who cares about any of us.

10:53.319 --> 10:54.945
Ah!

10:55.446 --> 10:57.740
Smells like retirement.

11:02.745 --> 11:04.413
There were two outcalls.

11:07.625 --> 11:09.085
<i>Twelve missed alerts.</i>

11:10.169 --> 11:11.170
Dammit.

11:16.133 --> 11:18.803
-Where the hell have you been?
-Uh, what's going on?

11:19.595 --> 11:20.888
Remember the rust from the planet

11:20.971 --> 11:22.640
they were so careful not to bring
on board?

11:23.307 --> 11:24.600
Let me guess, they missed a spot.

11:25.267 --> 11:27.186
We've iso-ed of the area,
tried to starve it out,

11:27.269 --> 11:28.479
but it's too aggressive, so--

11:28.562 --> 11:31.524
So, what, you're gonna amputate
a piece of the <i>Resolute?</i>

11:31.982 --> 11:33.567
Only as a last resort.

11:33.651 --> 11:35.903
-How many resorts do we have left?
-Not many.

11:35.986 --> 11:38.155
Under the floor are the intake vents
for the oxygenator,

11:38.239 --> 11:40.241
which means when the contaminant
breaches that door--

11:40.324 --> 11:42.201
We're fully screwed.

11:42.493 --> 11:43.327
Yeah.

11:43.411 --> 11:44.578
Welp, you're in luck.

11:44.662 --> 11:47.456
Don West is here. I'm the only guy
on board with an A-1 ordinance rating.

11:47.540 --> 11:48.999
Don, there's something else.

11:50.793 --> 11:52.378
We've got people inside the blast radius.

11:53.587 --> 11:54.630
How long till they get out?

11:54.714 --> 11:56.090
They're trapped.

11:56.173 --> 11:58.092
A crew's still trying to reach them,
but...

11:58.175 --> 11:59.009
But...

12:00.636 --> 12:02.513
Oh, just like that,
you're going to abandon them.

12:02.596 --> 12:05.933
I'm sorry. Maybe if you were here earlier
we could have figured out another way.

12:09.228 --> 12:10.896
Do we at least know who they are?

12:11.522 --> 12:13.232
Yeah. There's four of them.

12:13.315 --> 12:16.193
A teacher, a doctor,
the colonial rep's son

12:16.318 --> 12:17.778
and a friend of his, a girl.

12:19.613 --> 12:20.573
Penny?

12:39.550 --> 12:40.760
What did they say?

12:41.427 --> 12:43.596
They're talking about preparations
for something called

12:43.679 --> 12:45.139
a structural amendment.

12:45.431 --> 12:46.557
What is that?

12:47.725 --> 12:49.685
Whatever it is, it requires explosives.

12:50.060 --> 12:51.395
So...

12:52.354 --> 12:54.982
When a human limb is infected,

12:56.650 --> 12:59.278
what does the surgeon do
to save the rest of the body?

12:59.361 --> 13:02.531
They're not gonna blast us into space just
'cause we're connected to that hallway.

13:02.615 --> 13:04.200
Let's all just settle down.

13:04.325 --> 13:07.286
I'm sure they're still trying
to get to us first.

13:09.330 --> 13:13.167
But is there anyone over there
who could actually succeed?

13:15.753 --> 13:16.754
Penny...

13:19.423 --> 13:21.258
what would your mom do if she were here?

13:21.342 --> 13:23.928
How am I supposed to know?
She's the genius. I'm just her daughter.

13:24.011 --> 13:26.055
Look, you may not be the best Robinson,

13:26.388 --> 13:28.349
but you're the only Robinson we've got.

13:29.266 --> 13:30.351
You can do this.

13:30.434 --> 13:31.977
It's in your blood.

13:32.645 --> 13:33.521
Okay.

13:34.271 --> 13:35.731
Um...

13:35.856 --> 13:36.982
Think like my mom.

13:37.066 --> 13:39.068
She would...

13:41.070 --> 13:44.740
look at the situation
from a new perspective.

13:45.991 --> 13:47.535
I've actually heard her say that.

13:47.701 --> 13:48.911
Really? Okay.

13:49.078 --> 13:49.995
Um...

13:51.455 --> 13:53.249
She would...

13:54.041 --> 13:55.376
step back

13:55.668 --> 13:58.045
and see something...

14:01.298 --> 14:03.092
something that I...

14:03.634 --> 14:05.594
-don't...
- <i>Penny. Are you there?</i>

14:05.678 --> 14:06.637
-It's Don.
- <i>Don?</i>

14:06.720 --> 14:07.888
-Thank God.
- <i>Hey, kiddo.</i>

14:07.972 --> 14:09.640
Just want to let you know,
I'm on the case.

14:09.723 --> 14:11.225
Wait. You been up here the whole time?

14:12.393 --> 14:14.144
-Possibly.
-You didn't check up on me?

14:14.228 --> 14:16.313
I'm an unaccompanied minor
running through a spaceship.

14:16.397 --> 14:17.439
I value your independence?

14:17.523 --> 14:20.067
Uh, Don, this is-- This is serious.

14:20.150 --> 14:22.111
I need you to tell me honestly. Are they--

14:22.820 --> 14:24.697
Are they going to sacrifice us
to save the ship?

14:24.780 --> 14:27.575
If they have to, yeah, they will.

14:29.827 --> 14:32.621
But look, I'm on my way to see
the people in charge right now,

14:32.705 --> 14:33.998
<i>so you gotta give me something.</i>

14:34.081 --> 14:35.583
-Like what?
<i>-What do you got in there?</i>

14:35.666 --> 14:37.918
-What's in the room?
-Um... Desks,

14:38.586 --> 14:41.130
chairs, microscopes, school supplies.

14:41.338 --> 14:43.382
Chairs and desks aren't going to cut it.
What else?

14:44.174 --> 14:46.635
There's a box full of research samples
we use for class.

14:46.719 --> 14:49.763
<i>Wait, wait, wait! Is it on wheels,</i>
<i>double orange stripes along the base,</i>

14:49.847 --> 14:51.223
<i>-about four feet tall?</i>
-Yeah.

14:51.307 --> 14:53.559
Okay, that's it. I need you
to empty that box.

14:53.684 --> 14:54.602
<i>What for?</i>

14:54.894 --> 14:57.229
Because if you can get inside of it,
I can save your lives.

14:57.771 --> 14:58.689
<i>All right...</i>

14:59.148 --> 15:00.399
I'm going in. Wish me luck.

15:03.068 --> 15:05.905
<i>Maintenance personnel</i>
<i>zero-two-four-nine...</i>

15:05.988 --> 15:06.989
Excuse me. Captain?

15:07.072 --> 15:08.365
-Hey, wait!
-Sir! Stop!

15:08.449 --> 15:09.575
I'm Don West. I have an idea.

15:09.658 --> 15:11.785
Wherever you've been assigned, get back.

15:11.869 --> 15:13.704
Those four people
on the other side of the hull,

15:13.787 --> 15:16.081
-I can get them out.
-We got a team looking for another way in.

15:16.165 --> 15:18.167
Taking longer than we hoped,
but they have a chance.

15:18.250 --> 15:19.668
Yeah, well it's a lousy chance.

15:19.835 --> 15:21.670
I know it. Everybody here knows it.

15:21.754 --> 15:23.547
-We're wasting time.
-So, what's your plan?

15:24.256 --> 15:25.966
The sample box in the classroom?

15:26.050 --> 15:29.219
The A-B-996 series? They're airtight
and temperature controlled.

15:29.303 --> 15:31.096
-So?
-So if they get inside of it,

15:31.180 --> 15:32.556
-someone can pick them up.
-Pick them up?

15:32.640 --> 15:35.434
In a Jupiter. Yes, as the box floats
through space.

15:35.517 --> 15:37.853
Those sample crates weren't designed
for the vacuum of space.

15:37.937 --> 15:40.814
Correct. They weren't designed for it,
but funny enough, they handle well.

15:40.898 --> 15:42.024
How do you know that?

15:42.942 --> 15:43.984
I just do.

15:44.693 --> 15:45.694
I'm sorry.

15:45.861 --> 15:49.031
I can't in good conscience put a Jupiter
into the path of active debris

15:49.114 --> 15:51.617
for a desperate plan with absolutely
no proof that it would work.

15:51.700 --> 15:54.495
Then where is your conscience?
Because right now, can't really see it.

15:54.578 --> 15:55.579
Leave my bridge.

16:03.253 --> 16:04.171
Okay, listen.

16:05.214 --> 16:06.882
The reason I know it works

16:08.217 --> 16:09.718
is because I used some of those units

16:09.802 --> 16:12.346
to transport 36 Kobe steaks
to the colony.

16:12.972 --> 16:14.556
I did it three, four times.

16:15.557 --> 16:17.685
Okay, seven times
but that's not the point.

16:17.851 --> 16:20.604
The point is that
those steaks stayed fresh.

16:20.688 --> 16:22.856
-Kobe steaks?
-Melt in your mouth like butter.

16:22.940 --> 16:24.066
So, you're...

16:24.149 --> 16:25.693
Yes! I'm a smuggler.

16:26.026 --> 16:28.028
There. I said it. I'm a smuggler.

16:29.446 --> 16:31.865
Captain, it's going to work. Believe me.

16:33.534 --> 16:34.910
You can have your Jupiter,

16:34.994 --> 16:36.787
but if that corrosion reaches
the intake vent--

16:36.870 --> 16:38.622
Don't worry. They'll be out.

16:41.875 --> 16:43.252
Okay, Penny, we're in business!

16:43.377 --> 16:46.338
Now the storage box needs a propellant
to direct it away from the wreckage

16:46.422 --> 16:47.715
when they trigger the explosives.

16:47.798 --> 16:49.258
Don, we have another problem.

16:49.341 --> 16:50.259
What kind of a problem?

16:50.342 --> 16:52.344
Only three of us fit in the box.

17:11.947 --> 17:15.492
So all the time you were down here,
did you ever think maybe this is it?

17:15.993 --> 17:20.456
Alpha Centauri's out of reach and maybe
this place would have to be home?

17:20.539 --> 17:22.249
It was something we discussed.

17:24.043 --> 17:25.753
People are really quite resilient.

17:26.253 --> 17:28.297
First month or two they're on edge,
understandably.

17:29.256 --> 17:31.258
Around every corner
was a new form of life,

17:31.341 --> 17:32.926
a new challenge.

17:33.469 --> 17:36.263
But here we are, less than a year later
and everyone was just living.

17:36.930 --> 17:38.682
We put up fences to keep us safe,

17:38.932 --> 17:41.101
-to protect us from the...

17:41.185 --> 17:44.104
...unfamiliar, so I guess
in a way it's just like home.

17:48.025 --> 17:48.859
Hey, Mom.

17:49.276 --> 17:50.194
What is it, honey?

17:50.778 --> 17:51.612
The horses.

17:55.949 --> 17:57.326
Something's got them on edge.

18:05.250 --> 18:06.919
I think it's some kind of animal.

18:09.838 --> 18:10.672
Oh!

18:11.131 --> 18:12.841
Adler, do you know what those are?

18:14.218 --> 18:16.345
Scientists say
they're scavengers, mostly.

18:18.222 --> 18:19.598
Posts keep them away.

18:22.142 --> 18:24.144
<i>Security perimeter deactivated.</i>

18:24.603 --> 18:26.105
Did you touch something?

18:26.188 --> 18:28.065
-No. Will?
-No. Nothing.

18:28.148 --> 18:30.109
<i>Security perimeter active.</i>

18:35.239 --> 18:36.532
Okay. We're okay.

18:38.283 --> 18:40.160
<i>Security perimeter deactivated.</i>

18:40.244 --> 18:42.621
-Keeps going.
-Something interfering with the signal.

18:43.831 --> 18:45.582
<i>Security perimeter active.</i>

18:52.714 --> 18:53.674
Mom.

18:54.424 --> 18:55.884
Just stay calm, honey.

19:14.403 --> 19:15.696
- Mom.
-They're learning.

19:16.196 --> 19:18.740
-They know when the posts are off.
-Mom. What do we do now?

19:26.415 --> 19:28.917
Okay. If it happens again, you run.

19:30.919 --> 19:33.255
- Go! Run!

19:49.438 --> 19:50.439
It's him.

19:54.067 --> 19:55.402
I knew I'd find you.

20:09.082 --> 20:10.292
What happened to you?

20:10.375 --> 20:11.668
How'd you end up here?

20:11.752 --> 20:14.379
I mean, we aren't even sure how we did.
Oh, there's just--

20:14.546 --> 20:16.548
You're not gonna believe
everything that happened.

20:16.632 --> 20:18.717
There's so much I want to tell you.

20:33.440 --> 20:36.109
Hey, Mom, I think
he wants to show us something.

20:36.818 --> 20:37.778
Can we go?

20:38.987 --> 20:39.947
Sure.

20:51.124 --> 20:53.460
I think part of me didn't believe
the stories were true.

20:54.670 --> 20:57.422
That's the difference
between Will and the rest of us.

20:58.924 --> 21:00.592
He never stops believing.

21:09.559 --> 21:12.020
Could I ask you a favor?

21:12.521 --> 21:13.855
I don't want to impose, but, um...

21:13.939 --> 21:15.649
Yes, of course. What is it?

21:15.732 --> 21:17.150
I want my family to read this.

21:18.151 --> 21:20.195
I want them to know that in the end...

21:20.946 --> 21:23.991
it was my duty to protect the kids.

21:24.074 --> 21:25.450
You're offering to stay behind?

21:25.534 --> 21:27.286
It only holds three.

21:30.622 --> 21:31.456
Please.

21:33.458 --> 21:34.459
Don't say anything.

21:34.543 --> 21:36.461
This is already hard enough.

21:39.256 --> 21:40.215
Wait.

21:42.134 --> 21:43.593
If anyone not going...

21:45.012 --> 21:45.846
it'll be me.

21:45.929 --> 21:47.097
Really?

21:47.931 --> 21:49.850
This is something I have to do.

21:49.933 --> 21:52.936
There will be a new name added
to the Hall of Heroes.

21:53.020 --> 21:53.895
A word?

21:54.229 --> 21:55.564
Absolutely, Penny.

21:56.523 --> 21:57.566
Whatever you need.

21:58.525 --> 21:59.776
I know what you're doing.

22:00.861 --> 22:03.155
-Well, in that case, you're welcome.
-You cannot--

22:03.238 --> 22:05.866
Unless you've got a better solution,
one of us has to stay behind.

22:05.949 --> 22:07.576
It's best if someone volunteers.

22:07.659 --> 22:09.328
It's not volunteering
if you're conning him.

22:09.411 --> 22:10.871
Okay, um, I've been thinking.

22:11.371 --> 22:14.166
Um, if it means that
everybody else survives, then I'll--

22:14.249 --> 22:15.500
I'll do it. I'll stay.

22:16.168 --> 22:17.085
That works, too.

22:17.169 --> 22:18.045
What? No!

22:18.128 --> 22:20.130
We all go or nobody goes.

22:20.839 --> 22:22.549
That's exactly what
your mother would say.

22:23.508 --> 22:25.510
But you, Penny, are not your mother.

22:25.594 --> 22:27.596
You know how the world works;

22:28.263 --> 22:29.723
there are winners and losers

22:29.806 --> 22:32.225
and sometimes you have to break the rules
to get what you want.

22:32.351 --> 22:33.393
Don't.

22:33.518 --> 22:35.520
We can't do that. No.

22:36.063 --> 22:38.231
You don't have to.
That's what I'm here for.

22:38.523 --> 22:40.525
Just step aside and let me do
what I do best.

22:40.650 --> 22:42.694
Penny. Come take a look at this.

22:43.528 --> 22:44.488
Vijay, not now.

22:44.696 --> 22:45.572
No, it's just I--

22:45.655 --> 22:47.199
I think I found something.

22:55.916 --> 22:57.626
Bridge, this is an action report.

22:58.502 --> 22:59.544
It's time.

23:02.297 --> 23:03.507
Don, Don, come in.

23:03.590 --> 23:05.717
Please tell me you're calling me
from inside the box

23:05.801 --> 23:07.594
uncomfortably crammed
with three other people.

23:07.677 --> 23:09.012
Not yet. We need your brain.

23:09.096 --> 23:13.350
Okay. So, at the bottom of the box
there's like a heater or something.

23:13.433 --> 23:15.685
It regulates the temperature
of whatever's shipped in it.

23:15.769 --> 23:18.063
-In this case, you.
-What happens if we didn't have that?

23:18.146 --> 23:20.023
Well, you do know how cold space is.

23:20.107 --> 23:22.025
Can we survive or can't we?

23:22.109 --> 23:23.485
<i>Well, the box is vacuum-sealed</i>

23:23.568 --> 23:25.987
so with the heat of the air
and your radiant body temperatures,

23:26.071 --> 23:29.074
-I'd say you have about a minute.
-But you can get us before then, right?

23:30.534 --> 23:31.493
<i>Don?</i>

23:34.621 --> 23:36.331
I want you to know what to expect.

23:37.249 --> 23:39.960
When the charges blow
it's going to get very cold, very fast.

23:40.669 --> 23:41.837
<i>You'll start shivering.</i>

23:42.754 --> 23:45.132
<i>Your hands and feet are gonna go numb.</i>

23:46.133 --> 23:47.801
Then you'll start breathing fast.

23:48.927 --> 23:51.054
You might get a warm, tingly feeling, but,

23:51.930 --> 23:54.099
then it's gonna start shaking even more.

23:56.351 --> 23:58.145
Then you'll stop thinking straight.

23:58.854 --> 24:00.272
Then the shaking will stop,

24:01.148 --> 24:02.023
and then...

24:06.528 --> 24:07.571
And then what?

24:09.656 --> 24:11.825
Then you'll see me waiting there
with a warm blanket.

24:15.162 --> 24:16.830
-Pull it out.

24:16.913 --> 24:19.082
You'll still need a propellant
of some sort.

24:19.624 --> 24:21.710
The fire extinguisher and zip ties.

24:22.252 --> 24:23.712
Duct tape it to the side of the box

24:23.795 --> 24:26.506
<i>with the nozzle pointing away from</i>
<i>where the hole's gonna be blown.</i>

24:26.590 --> 24:28.550
<i>Those models have about</i>
<i>thirty seconds of spray,</i>

24:28.633 --> 24:30.469
<i>so hopefully it'll be enough</i>
<i>to blow you clear.</i>

24:30.552 --> 24:33.221
And yes, duct tape does hold up in space.

24:33.305 --> 24:34.389
I've tried it...

24:35.682 --> 24:37.100
but let's not get into that.

24:40.854 --> 24:42.439
They say you're the best pilot here.

24:42.522 --> 24:44.524
They say you are a pain in the ass.

24:44.774 --> 24:47.402
We're going to get along
just fine.

24:48.445 --> 24:50.447
All right, everybody.
We have five minutes. Load up.

24:50.947 --> 24:53.241
This goes without saying:
I hope nobody had beans for lunch.

24:53.825 --> 24:55.368
Mr. Jackson, we're running out of time.

24:55.911 --> 24:56.953
I...

24:57.370 --> 24:58.580
Come on, you need to get in.

24:59.831 --> 25:01.082
I can't.

25:02.209 --> 25:03.919
<i>Logistical platform is a go.</i>

25:04.002 --> 25:04.836
Copy that.

25:05.337 --> 25:06.505
Charges set.

25:07.547 --> 25:09.633
I thought I could, but I can't.

25:10.133 --> 25:12.135
When you had offered to stay behind,

25:12.636 --> 25:14.638
it wasn't because you're a hero.

25:14.971 --> 25:16.348
You're claustrophobic.

25:16.431 --> 25:17.641
Just-- Just go.

25:17.724 --> 25:19.309
I respect your decision.

25:20.352 --> 25:22.020
-We have like four minutes left--
-No.

25:22.103 --> 25:23.605
Not until Mr. Jackson gets in the box.

25:23.688 --> 25:24.898
I'm not going in there!

25:25.315 --> 25:27.609
<i>Clear immediate surroundings.</i>

25:27.692 --> 25:29.694
<i>Clear immediate surroundings.</i>

25:30.111 --> 25:31.947
-You can help him.
-Me?

25:32.030 --> 25:35.325
Yes, you said it before, to step aside
and let you do what you do best.

25:35.408 --> 25:36.826
This is what you do best,

25:36.910 --> 25:39.371
convincing people to do things
is like your superpower.

25:39.454 --> 25:41.122
-There's no time.
-You got my mom to trust you,

25:41.206 --> 25:43.291
and you got my little brother
to let you out of jail,

25:43.375 --> 25:45.252
and you got everybody
on the <i>Resolute </i>convinced

25:45.335 --> 25:47.837
-that you're a legitimate therapist.
-I am a legitimate therapist.

25:47.921 --> 25:50.549
So prove it.
If you really want to be Dr. Smith,

25:51.424 --> 25:53.093
be Dr. Smith.

25:53.176 --> 25:55.762
If you're not already in the box,
you better get in.

25:58.348 --> 25:59.516
Mr. Jackson...

26:01.351 --> 26:02.477
take a deep breath.

26:03.019 --> 26:05.188
I can't get trapped in there.

26:07.232 --> 26:09.359
You've been trapped before,

26:09.442 --> 26:10.569
haven't you?

26:10.777 --> 26:12.195
You won't understand.

26:12.946 --> 26:13.989
You weren't there.

26:14.155 --> 26:15.031
That's true.

26:15.824 --> 26:16.825
I wasn't.

26:19.452 --> 26:20.787
But you can take me there.

26:27.043 --> 26:29.462
Don, it's accelerating.
We may need to go early.

26:29.546 --> 26:30.630
Negative.

26:30.714 --> 26:32.841
I'm gonna need every second you've got.

26:32.924 --> 26:34.217
Close your eyes.

26:35.302 --> 26:36.761
Tell me what you see.

26:38.054 --> 26:39.806
It's small. Dark.

26:40.348 --> 26:41.433
I can't move.

26:43.727 --> 26:45.478
I was down in that hole for hours.

26:46.271 --> 26:47.564
But you're here now,

26:48.106 --> 26:50.233
which means you got out of that hole.

26:50.317 --> 26:51.568
I didn't. I...

26:52.902 --> 26:54.029
I couldn't.

26:56.281 --> 26:57.365
Not by myself.

26:57.866 --> 26:59.868
And you're not by yourself now.

27:02.746 --> 27:04.497
I know what it's like to feel trapped.

27:07.083 --> 27:08.752
Someone pulled you out...

27:10.045 --> 27:10.920
...didn't they?

27:12.547 --> 27:13.798
My mother.

27:13.882 --> 27:15.300
She heard my voice.

27:15.383 --> 27:16.593
I hear your voice.

27:16.676 --> 27:17.886
She took my hand.

27:19.638 --> 27:20.680
I've got your hand.

27:22.641 --> 27:24.225
Remember what that felt like?

27:25.644 --> 27:27.646
When you knew you were safe,

27:28.021 --> 27:29.522
you got out of that hole.

27:32.859 --> 27:36.321
You were selected to travel
to Alpha Centauri...

27:38.448 --> 27:40.283
and now you've gone farther...

27:42.243 --> 27:45.038
than any human has ever gone!

27:48.416 --> 27:50.585
All it takes is one more step.

28:03.598 --> 28:04.724
Don!

28:08.186 --> 28:09.229
Twenty seconds.

28:09.312 --> 28:10.647
It's now or never, kids.

28:11.439 --> 28:12.315
It's now.

28:16.236 --> 28:17.278
See you soon.

28:20.031 --> 28:21.700
<i>Mr. West,</i>
<i>we can't wait any longer.</i>

28:22.283 --> 28:23.493
It's up to you now.

28:24.828 --> 28:25.787
On your command.

28:28.164 --> 28:29.040
Countdown.

28:29.791 --> 28:30.750
<i>Ten...</i>

28:32.335 --> 28:33.545
<i>nine...</i>

28:35.755 --> 28:36.589
Ready?

28:38.675 --> 28:40.719
Penny, Penny, Penny, Penny.
Your elbow's in my ribs.

28:40.802 --> 28:41.970
Oh! Sorry.

28:42.429 --> 28:43.471
Is that better?

28:43.638 --> 28:45.598
<i>-</i>No, that's worse, actually.
-Ooh. Okay.

28:45.682 --> 28:47.434
<i>...three...</i>

28:47.517 --> 28:49.310
<i>two, one.</i>

28:59.821 --> 29:02.115
Oh, God, it is really cold.

29:37.358 --> 29:39.986
<i>...just a little longer.</i>
<i>We're in position.</i>

29:44.032 --> 29:46.785
<i>Four, three, two...</i>

30:09.808 --> 30:10.850
Shh, shh, shh.

30:20.735 --> 30:22.111
You're okay. I gotcha.

30:25.490 --> 30:27.575
<i> We got 'em!</i>
<i>Everyone's safe!</i>

30:38.461 --> 30:41.047
<i> No sign of rust.</i>
<i>We're all clear.</i>

30:48.012 --> 30:49.347
You seem so relaxed.

30:49.430 --> 30:50.974
The way you leave them alone together.

30:52.016 --> 30:53.768
Will wouldn't be alive
if it wasn't for him.

30:53.852 --> 30:55.228
So you trust it completely.

30:57.230 --> 30:58.523
Let me put it this way.

30:59.148 --> 31:01.359
If I had to choose somebody
to get us home safe

31:01.442 --> 31:03.444
and it was between the robot and you...

31:08.408 --> 31:10.159
This is what you wanted to show me?

31:11.953 --> 31:12.787
Will?

31:14.080 --> 31:15.039
You did this.

31:15.665 --> 31:16.749
What is it?

31:16.833 --> 31:17.959
Drawings.

31:18.167 --> 31:20.253
-He made them.
- Drawings of what?

31:21.254 --> 31:22.088
Us.

31:23.339 --> 31:24.215
The tree,

31:24.591 --> 31:25.925
when I first saw you.

31:26.551 --> 31:27.385
And...

31:27.468 --> 31:29.012
Ah, the jellyfish!

31:30.555 --> 31:31.806
And playing catch,

31:31.890 --> 31:33.892
and Judy when he saved her from the ice.

31:35.852 --> 31:36.769
Memories?

31:37.812 --> 31:39.814
Yeah... but...

31:41.232 --> 31:42.609
they're not all his.

31:43.318 --> 31:44.569
Some of these are mine.

31:49.824 --> 31:51.326
Even though we were apart,

31:52.118 --> 31:53.494
you saw these things, too.

31:58.041 --> 31:59.959
We've been connected this whole time.

32:02.086 --> 32:03.755
Oh... Yeah.

32:04.464 --> 32:06.883
I think these happened
the other way around.

32:15.975 --> 32:18.102
What would you like to call
your masterpiece?

32:18.186 --> 32:19.729
<i>Danger.</i>

32:22.982 --> 32:25.193
When you said this place
was danger,

32:25.944 --> 32:27.070
what did you mean?

32:28.821 --> 32:29.906
Danger for us...

32:33.117 --> 32:34.285
or danger for you?

32:40.041 --> 32:41.668
I... I don't understand.

32:44.921 --> 32:46.547
What do you want me to tell you?

32:47.131 --> 32:49.175
The forest. It was on fire.

32:50.134 --> 32:51.177
You saved me.

32:57.642 --> 33:00.061
Maybe it's his way
of wanting to talk to you.

33:01.020 --> 33:01.980
Share stories.

33:02.897 --> 33:04.565
Is that what you want?

33:04.649 --> 33:06.484
To talk about when we first connected?

33:11.322 --> 33:12.156
Are you okay?

33:16.828 --> 33:19.414
Are you hurt,
like when we first met in the--

33:31.551 --> 33:32.802
Hey, Mom.

33:34.804 --> 33:37.640
I think it's too far for Robot to walk.

33:38.516 --> 33:39.600
Let's leave him here.

33:39.684 --> 33:41.686
Then we can come back
and pick him up in a Jupiter.

33:42.437 --> 33:44.147
No. It makes sense
if we all stick together.

33:44.230 --> 33:46.190
No! No, that's not a good idea.

33:46.816 --> 33:47.859
In fact...

33:49.444 --> 33:50.570
it's a bad one, Mom.

33:52.155 --> 33:54.490
It's definitely bad.

34:02.540 --> 34:03.374
Will, run!

34:03.916 --> 34:04.876
Mom!

34:08.337 --> 34:09.255
No!

34:15.595 --> 34:17.305
Wait. Mom. Mom.

34:17.388 --> 34:18.598
It's okay.

34:19.766 --> 34:21.267
He doesn't want to kill me.

34:22.143 --> 34:23.853
He brought me here for a reason.

34:25.855 --> 34:27.231
What do you want?

34:28.066 --> 34:29.233
-Wait! Don't!
-No!

34:30.151 --> 34:31.277
I remember you.

34:31.861 --> 34:33.946
Before, you wanted the engine.

34:34.447 --> 34:35.406
Right?

34:35.656 --> 34:38.409
This time, you want something else.

34:38.993 --> 34:40.995
That's why you brought the robot here.

34:41.662 --> 34:42.497
Isn't it?

34:43.122 --> 34:43.998
It was a trap...

34:46.250 --> 34:47.085
for me.

34:49.003 --> 34:49.837
Why?

34:53.424 --> 34:54.509
What do you want with me?

34:56.385 --> 34:57.595
Well,  you can have me.

34:58.346 --> 35:00.598
-Just let my mom go.
-No, no!

35:25.331 --> 35:27.375
I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you.

35:29.335 --> 35:30.211
You're welcome.

35:32.922 --> 35:34.507
What's up with you? We made it.

35:35.591 --> 35:37.552
Yeah. We all survived,
no thanks to the black sheep

35:37.635 --> 35:39.387
of the Robinson family.

35:40.221 --> 35:41.889
It was Don's idea to use the box.

35:41.973 --> 35:44.308
It was your idea
to pull out the heating unit.

35:44.475 --> 35:48.437
Smith used witchcraft to save Mr. Jackson.

35:48.521 --> 35:50.690
-And...
-No, you saved Mr. Jackson.

35:51.774 --> 35:53.359
What are you talking about?

35:54.944 --> 35:56.904
You really think anyone else
could have convinced

35:56.988 --> 35:58.406
Dr. Smith to be a good person?

35:59.824 --> 36:01.033
What's more Robinson than that?

36:01.117 --> 36:01.951
Here.

36:02.034 --> 36:02.994
Go crazy.

36:05.663 --> 36:07.123
Chocolate? Where did you get this?

36:07.206 --> 36:08.541
This is like gold up here.

36:08.624 --> 36:09.917
It's actually easier to get gold.

36:10.001 --> 36:12.336
You're gonna have to eat this quick
before it gets impounded.

36:12.420 --> 36:13.504
Don West.

36:13.629 --> 36:14.547
Here we go.

36:14.755 --> 36:17.133
You've been charged
with violating the code of service,

36:17.216 --> 36:18.968
transportation of illegal goods...

36:19.594 --> 36:22.013
Excuse me. What are you doing?
He just rescued us.

36:22.096 --> 36:24.223
I'm sure that'll be taken
into consideration.

36:24.307 --> 36:25.766
And what proof do you have?

36:25.933 --> 36:27.393
He confessed.

36:27.476 --> 36:28.311
What?

36:29.312 --> 36:30.563
Why would you do that?

36:31.189 --> 36:32.064
It was worth it.

36:49.624 --> 36:53.252
You told me that machine
was just meant to control robots.

36:56.339 --> 36:57.840
We couldn't risk losing Will.

37:43.803 --> 37:44.720
This is it.

37:45.221 --> 37:46.097
He was here.

37:46.889 --> 37:48.099
He was right here.

37:48.182 --> 37:49.475
Mom!

37:49.558 --> 37:51.811
Whoa!

37:56.941 --> 37:58.693
<i>Will Robinson.</i>
