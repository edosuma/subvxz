00:01.503 --> 00:03.404
♪

00:20.622 --> 00:21.823
Morning.

00:25.927 --> 00:28.863
How you doing?

00:28.897 --> 00:30.832
Didn't sleep a wink.

00:30.865 --> 00:33.802
I wish you'd just stayed
with me last night.

00:35.770 --> 00:37.171
Yeah. I wanted to be here

00:37.205 --> 00:40.208
in case Sly had any
last-minute stuff to go over.

00:40.241 --> 00:41.910
That way, I wasn't across town.

00:46.581 --> 00:48.583
Good morning.
You ready?

00:50.218 --> 00:51.753
Where's the rest of the team?

00:51.786 --> 00:53.588
They're, um...

00:53.622 --> 00:55.590
taking care of something
at the courthouse.

00:55.624 --> 00:56.958
He's here.

01:02.030 --> 01:03.765
All right. Commence
Operation Judge Nudge.

01:08.269 --> 01:10.104
There you go, Paige,

01:10.138 --> 01:11.840
stink yourself up good.

01:13.274 --> 01:14.809
Pardon me.

01:16.645 --> 01:18.880
That's right, get the relaxing
scent of lavender all over him.

01:18.913 --> 01:20.248
I'm terribly sorry.
No problem.

01:20.281 --> 01:21.349
Did you get
enough on him?

01:21.382 --> 01:24.519
Better be. Gave the guy
everything but a lap dance.

01:24.553 --> 01:26.254
Happy, how goes you?

01:26.287 --> 01:28.590
HAPPY: Almost done.
Judge Tuck's courtroom is set

01:28.623 --> 01:30.258
for a soothing 69 degrees.

01:30.291 --> 01:32.060
Tuck will be cool
and comfortable

01:32.093 --> 01:33.127
instead of hot and bothered.

01:33.161 --> 01:34.896
All right, Walt,
he's headed your way.

01:34.929 --> 01:35.730
WALTER:
On it.

01:37.632 --> 01:40.301
Uh, one large non-fat
double short cap,

01:40.334 --> 01:43.705
two pumps of vanilla,
a pinch of cinnamon,

01:43.738 --> 01:46.240
and extra foam,

01:46.274 --> 01:49.678
and two sugars, please.

01:49.711 --> 01:50.679
Morning, Alice.

01:50.712 --> 01:51.613
Morning, Judge.

01:51.646 --> 01:54.115
I'll have your Earl Grey
up in just a moment.

01:54.148 --> 01:56.618
Keep the change.
Thank you.

01:56.651 --> 01:57.752
Okay, Toby.

01:57.786 --> 01:59.320
All right, our jurist
will be calm

01:59.353 --> 02:01.289
as opposed to tweaked out
on caffeine.

02:01.322 --> 02:04.258
And now the piÃ¨ce de rÃ©sistance.

02:04.292 --> 02:06.828
Everyone chills when listening
to the comforting music

02:06.861 --> 02:08.196
of the tropics.

02:08.229 --> 02:10.899
(steel drums playing
gentle music)

02:14.736 --> 02:19.007
Cabe's fate will be decided
by a very mellow fellow.

02:19.040 --> 02:20.875
Cabe, on the other hand,
looks pissed.

02:23.912 --> 02:25.113
You did what?

02:25.146 --> 02:27.181
A university study showed
people handed down

02:27.215 --> 02:29.183
more lenient sentences
when they're, you know...

02:29.217 --> 02:31.285
(Jamaican accent):
feelin' irie, mon.

02:31.319 --> 02:32.987
Do you know how much trouble
we would've gotten into

02:33.021 --> 02:33.988
if you would've gotten caught?

02:34.022 --> 02:36.057
Perfumes, teas,

02:36.090 --> 02:37.892
manipulating
a municipal building.

02:37.926 --> 02:39.794
We just wanted to help.
We're scared.

02:39.828 --> 02:41.062
It's a bit tense.

02:41.095 --> 02:43.164
(sighs) I know.

02:43.197 --> 02:44.298
I'm sorry. Me, too.

02:44.332 --> 02:46.635
Uh, then let's go get settled.

02:46.668 --> 02:48.336
If it gets tight
during the trial,

02:48.369 --> 02:50.672
just look over your shoulder,
you'll see your friends.

02:50.705 --> 02:52.173
We've got your back.

02:52.206 --> 02:53.274
About that.

02:53.307 --> 02:55.644
I got a call late last night
from the court clerk.

02:55.677 --> 02:58.246
They've decided on a
closed courtroom. What?

02:58.279 --> 03:00.915
Evidence regarding Scorpion's
previous cases might come up,

03:00.949 --> 03:02.350
could jeopardize
national security,

03:02.383 --> 03:05.319
so... it is a nonpublic trial.

03:05.353 --> 03:06.387
PAIGE:
Wait.

03:06.420 --> 03:08.356
So this is good-bye?

03:08.389 --> 03:10.258
Th-This is it?

03:10.291 --> 03:12.160
No. No, it's not good-bye.

03:12.193 --> 03:16.064
I've got the hardest
working lawyer in town,

03:16.097 --> 03:17.832
and I'm innocent.

03:17.866 --> 03:20.401
So I'll be back
in the garage tonight

03:20.434 --> 03:21.736
celebrating with you guys.

03:23.171 --> 03:26.240
But if something does happen,

03:26.274 --> 03:28.877
I left each of you
a gift on your desks.

03:28.910 --> 03:32.280
Don't open it until you know
how the coin lands on this one.

03:37.819 --> 03:39.120
Well, I should go.

03:39.153 --> 03:41.422
No tears.

03:41.455 --> 03:42.891
No hugs.

03:42.924 --> 03:44.192
Just need to go.

03:49.230 --> 03:50.965
(whispers):
You're gonna be all right, kid.

03:50.999 --> 03:52.633
All right?

03:58.239 --> 04:00.208
You get to come with us, Allie.

04:00.241 --> 04:01.776
Thank you.

04:01.810 --> 04:05.379
But I'm gonna wait here.
I just want to be close.

04:05.413 --> 04:07.916
I can't imagine what
he's feeling right now.

04:12.787 --> 04:14.288
BAILIFF:
All rise.

04:17.491 --> 04:19.060
That's not Judge Tuck.
JUDGE: Be seated.

04:19.093 --> 04:22.230
Judge Tuck received
a phone call--

04:22.263 --> 04:24.733
medical issue with his wife.

04:24.766 --> 04:27.435
She'll be okay, but I've been
assigned to hear the case.

04:27.468 --> 04:29.838
So, uh, let me just...

04:30.872 --> 04:32.841
It's like the Arctic in here.

04:32.874 --> 04:34.442
Fix the heat, will you, please?

04:34.475 --> 04:37.145
HAPPY: Find out
what you can on this guy.

04:37.178 --> 04:39.047
Already on it.
Oh, crap.

04:39.080 --> 04:41.482
This is
Judge Max Talbertson,

04:41.515 --> 04:44.786
aka Maximum Max Talbertson,
'cause he hands out convictions

04:44.819 --> 04:46.020
and harsh sentences
like breath mints.

04:46.054 --> 04:47.155
(Jamaican accent):
We're screwed, mon.

04:47.188 --> 04:48.322
Doubly screwed.

04:48.356 --> 04:49.557
That was Homeland.

04:49.590 --> 04:51.960
Do they know that we hacked
the court's security cameras?

04:51.993 --> 04:54.028
Nope, but we should
power that down

04:54.062 --> 04:55.797
when our new handler gets here.

04:55.830 --> 04:57.498
New handler? HAPPY: No way.
Cabe's our handler.

04:57.531 --> 05:00.168
In the event
that he's convicted,

05:00.201 --> 05:01.770
Homeland is sending over

05:01.803 --> 05:04.472
Clarence Mickelthorn,
who is going to interview us to,

05:04.505 --> 05:05.673
and I quote,

05:05.706 --> 05:09.077
"determine whether Homeland's
relationship with Scorpion

05:09.110 --> 05:10.378
is beneficial
to the government."

05:10.411 --> 05:12.781
And if he feels we aren't?

05:12.814 --> 05:15.850
Well, we lose our status
as approved federal contractors,

05:15.884 --> 05:17.118
and considering our current
financial situation,

05:17.151 --> 05:20.421
that means we're...
out of business.

05:20.454 --> 05:21.322
This is nuts.

05:21.355 --> 05:23.391
I got to clear my head.
I'm such an idiot.

05:23.424 --> 05:25.459
If we want to hear what's
going on in the courtroom,

05:25.493 --> 05:27.796
I can just hack a ham radio
signal and try to pick up

05:27.829 --> 05:29.430
the frequency
of the bailiff's walkie.

05:29.463 --> 05:30.899
PAIGE:
Walter,

05:30.932 --> 05:33.401
you haven't had much to say.
Anything you want

05:33.434 --> 05:35.136
to add to this?

05:35.169 --> 05:37.038
Nope.

05:38.172 --> 05:40.241
Since Mr. Gallo requested
a bench trial,

05:40.274 --> 05:43.177
I will be both
judge and jury.

05:43.211 --> 05:46.247
In my courtroom, you will find
that words matter.

05:46.280 --> 05:48.249
Facts matter.

05:48.282 --> 05:50.418
And we'll stick to the facts.

05:50.451 --> 05:54.555
The State may present
its opening argument.

05:54.588 --> 05:56.825
Your Honor, we are not here
just about facts

05:56.858 --> 05:58.426
but relevant facts.

05:58.459 --> 06:00.094
All of the service
that the defendant

06:00.128 --> 06:02.230
has provided
to the military,

06:02.263 --> 06:04.065
to the FBI, to
Homeland Security

06:04.098 --> 06:06.400
is admirable.

06:06.434 --> 06:08.970
But it is completely irrelevant

06:09.003 --> 06:10.371
to these proceedings.
All that's relevant

06:10.404 --> 06:12.506
is Mr. Gallo's actions.

06:12.540 --> 06:14.308
And we know his actions:

06:14.342 --> 06:17.145
he used a key,
he unlocked an ankle cuff,

06:17.178 --> 06:20.548
and he let Mark Collins,
a federal prisoner, go free.

06:20.581 --> 06:22.884
Any other fact
is moot

06:22.917 --> 06:24.352
and should not be considered.

06:24.385 --> 06:25.419
Thank you.

06:25.453 --> 06:28.823
Mr. Dodd, your opening.

06:28.857 --> 06:31.292
Your Honor...
(clears throat)

06:31.325 --> 06:33.962
my client is a military hero.

06:33.995 --> 06:34.996
He...
Counselor,

06:35.029 --> 06:36.831
I agree with

06:36.865 --> 06:38.466
Ms. Dine's
assessment that

06:38.499 --> 06:41.169
Mr. Gallo's
prior service

06:41.202 --> 06:43.171
is not germane
to these proceedings.

06:43.204 --> 06:46.207
Hence, I will not be
entertaining such argument.

06:46.240 --> 06:47.541
Okay.

06:47.575 --> 06:48.943
Uh...

06:48.977 --> 06:50.912
I will just readjust
on the fly here.

06:50.945 --> 06:53.281
It'll only take a minute.

06:56.617 --> 06:57.852
PAIGE: Is it a bad sign
when your lawyer

06:57.886 --> 06:59.387
tears up his opening statement?

06:59.420 --> 07:01.455
If I could just crack
this radio, we'd be able to hear

07:01.489 --> 07:03.391
what's going on in there,
instead of playing charades.

07:03.424 --> 07:05.994
MAN: Officer Salerno responding
to 7th and Brockton.

07:06.027 --> 07:07.528
Okay, that's a police walkie.

07:07.561 --> 07:08.662
Come on, dummy, you can do this.

07:08.696 --> 07:11.565
Um, you called yourself idiot
earlier and now dummy.

07:11.599 --> 07:13.401
Why don't you take it easy
on yourself?

07:13.434 --> 07:14.869
Make way!

07:14.903 --> 07:16.470
(gasps)
Toby!

07:16.504 --> 07:17.571
What are you doing?!

07:17.605 --> 07:20.041
(panting)

07:20.074 --> 07:22.376
Dusted off the old unicycle.

07:22.410 --> 07:25.313
Bike makes me "two" tired.

07:25.346 --> 07:27.248
Don't you get it?

07:27.281 --> 07:28.449
Two-tire...d.

07:31.619 --> 07:34.155
I found a scone in the back of
the fridge. I hope no one minds.

07:34.188 --> 07:35.957
That's from Halloween.

07:35.990 --> 07:37.491
Shh!
This is Officer Salerno.

07:37.525 --> 07:40.628
We have a report of a small dog
stuck in some kind of hole

07:40.661 --> 07:43.631
in the ground. Great, instead of
the trial, I get a stupid dog.

07:43.664 --> 07:45.233
Man, I am a moron.

07:45.266 --> 07:46.667
Well, of course. You're
attempting to hack an archaic

07:46.700 --> 07:48.569
analog system.
The odds are staggering.

07:48.602 --> 07:52.606
You know, amongst all this
stress, you almost seem serene.

07:52.640 --> 07:55.143
What's that all about?
Mm. It's an astute observation.

07:55.176 --> 07:57.345
You see, at first, I was
very concerned about the trial.

07:57.378 --> 07:59.680
Keeping me up at night,
interfering with work--

07:59.713 --> 08:01.549
very inefficient. So,

08:01.582 --> 08:04.252
I began to read what others have
said about dealing with stress--

08:04.285 --> 08:06.054
uh, Tesla, Shakespeare.

08:06.087 --> 08:07.989
But the philosophy
that I found the most useful

08:08.022 --> 08:09.590
is by an American
baseball player

08:09.623 --> 08:11.625
called John Milton Rivers.

08:11.659 --> 08:13.527
Mickey Rivers?

08:16.264 --> 08:17.565
I-I love Mickey Rivers.

08:17.598 --> 08:19.700
He played for the Yanks
in the '70s, right?

08:19.733 --> 08:22.603
He was the guy who used to, uh,
he batted like this, right?

08:24.438 --> 08:25.673
All irrelevant information.

08:25.706 --> 08:29.343
So, a news reporter asked him
how he stayed calm under fire.

08:29.377 --> 08:31.946
He said, "I don't get upset over
things that I can't control,

08:31.980 --> 08:33.147
"because I can't control them,

08:33.181 --> 08:34.615
"so what's the use
in getting upset?

08:34.648 --> 08:36.417
"I don't get upset over
the things that I can control,

08:36.450 --> 08:39.087
"because I can control them,
so there's no use

08:39.120 --> 08:40.554
in getting upset."
(chuckles)

08:40.588 --> 08:42.423
So I care very much about Cabe.

08:42.456 --> 08:44.658
I wouldn't want anything bad
happening to him.

08:44.692 --> 08:46.527
But I can't control

08:46.560 --> 08:49.697
what is happening, so I have
decided to not let it affect me.

08:49.730 --> 08:51.365
Okay.

08:51.399 --> 08:53.001
As long as you're not affected.

08:53.034 --> 08:55.169
Not one bit.

08:55.203 --> 08:58.506
Upon arrival, use nylon rope,
try to lasso the dog,

08:58.539 --> 09:01.075
pull him up to the surface.
TOBY: Good luck.

09:01.109 --> 09:04.178
There is no way they're getting
a rope around his waist.

09:04.212 --> 09:05.246
Do we have any milk here?

09:06.214 --> 09:08.516
Forget it. I'll check.

09:08.549 --> 09:10.184
Oh. Oh, look.

09:10.218 --> 09:12.753
Homeland Director Carson's
about to take the stand.

09:12.786 --> 09:15.556
Paige, you-you see that
body language? How cocky he is?

09:15.589 --> 09:17.258
There's no way
Sly's doing well,

09:17.291 --> 09:18.993
or he would appear more thrown.

09:19.027 --> 09:20.361
This is Officer Salerno.

09:20.394 --> 09:22.263
Puppy's far down.
It's shying away from the rope.

09:22.296 --> 09:24.065
Requesting LAFD backup.

09:24.098 --> 09:26.134
Oh, geez,
who could've predicted that?

09:26.167 --> 09:27.735
Oh, it must've fallen
into one of those old

09:27.768 --> 09:30.071
19th century cisterns
that they have down in old L.A.

09:30.104 --> 09:31.672
Guys, the judge is showing
agreement markers

09:31.705 --> 09:34.108
when Carson speaks.

09:34.142 --> 09:37.278
Thanks, Dispatch. Awaiting
arrival of hook and ladder.

09:37.311 --> 09:40.281
I know the area
around 7th and Brockton

09:40.314 --> 09:41.482
from watching a documentary

09:41.515 --> 09:44.585
on the building of the
L.A. subway tunnels.

09:44.618 --> 09:47.388
The soil has a lot of silt
from the old riverbed.

09:47.421 --> 09:49.290
Well, silt compresses easily.

09:49.323 --> 09:51.692
Weight of that fire truck
is too much for that topography.

09:51.725 --> 09:53.027
Could cause the cistern
to collapse.

09:53.061 --> 09:54.228
Right onto the puppy?

09:54.262 --> 09:55.596
Guys, 7th and Brockton

09:55.629 --> 09:57.131
is only ten blocks from here.

09:57.165 --> 09:58.732
We're gonna go save
that dog, aren't we?!

09:58.766 --> 09:59.700
Damn right we are.
(squeaks)

09:59.733 --> 10:01.502
Okay, guys, grab your gear.

10:01.535 --> 10:03.337
Oh, Paige, the fire department
are gonna get pissed

10:03.371 --> 10:06.140
when we tell them to back off,
so you'll have to talk to them.

10:06.174 --> 10:07.641
Wait, hold on.
I don't want a puppy to die,

10:07.675 --> 10:09.643
but Clarence Mickelthorn
is coming to evaluate the team.

10:09.677 --> 10:11.812
If we're not here,
he could shut us down.

10:11.845 --> 10:13.347
Paige, uh, I'll explain
what's happening here.

10:13.381 --> 10:15.749
Um, y-you see,
we're people with almost 600

10:15.783 --> 10:18.152
IQ points between us.
And we're waiting for a judge

10:18.186 --> 10:19.687
with an IQ of, what, 120, tops,

10:19.720 --> 10:21.155
to determine the fate
of our friend.

10:21.189 --> 10:22.456
We're not used
to feeling helpless.

10:22.490 --> 10:24.125
We are used
to solving problems.

10:24.158 --> 10:25.626
When we can't
control things,

10:25.659 --> 10:28.129
just like Walt and Mickey Rivers
said, we don't react well.

10:28.162 --> 10:30.731
But this doggy situation is
something that we can control.

10:30.764 --> 10:32.666
We need a fix
of something we can fix,

10:32.700 --> 10:34.835
'cause the stress of waiting
to see if Gallo gets the gallows

10:34.868 --> 10:36.104
will drive us nuts.

10:36.137 --> 10:37.771
And it's your job
to keep us sane.

10:37.805 --> 10:39.307
'Cause come hell or high water,

10:39.340 --> 10:42.776
we are getting that hound out
of the ground.

10:48.216 --> 10:49.450
There's the truck!

10:49.483 --> 10:50.651
Toby, the car's still moving.

10:56.624 --> 10:58.092
(horn honking)

11:02.130 --> 11:03.597
Are you crazy?

11:03.631 --> 11:06.167
Hey! You trying to get killed?

11:06.200 --> 11:07.368
You can't bring
that truck any closer

11:07.401 --> 11:10.138
to the cistern or you'll cause
a collapse and kill that dog!

11:10.171 --> 11:12.806
Who the hell are you, and how
do you know about the dog?

11:12.840 --> 11:15.843
We heard it on the police radio,
and we are a team of geniuses

11:15.876 --> 11:17.745
who work
with the federal government.

11:17.778 --> 11:19.480
Geniuses? I doubt it.

11:23.217 --> 11:25.253
Yeah. He's just unnerving
a truck full of guys

11:25.286 --> 11:27.188
who want to kick his ass

11:27.221 --> 11:28.756
with a psychological process
called

11:28.789 --> 11:29.823
non sequitural distraction.

11:29.857 --> 11:30.891
Nice moves, babe.

11:30.924 --> 11:33.761
Thank you, darling.

11:33.794 --> 11:35.796
(grunts)
Oh.

11:39.200 --> 11:40.801
Oh, there he is, I see him.

11:40.834 --> 11:43.137
Oh, no, he's terrified.

11:43.171 --> 11:45.306
It's okay sweetheart, we're
gonna get you out of here.

11:46.340 --> 11:48.342
(whimpering)

11:57.918 --> 11:59.487
I'm telling you
to get out of here.

11:59.520 --> 12:01.889
You still don't
believe me? Fine.

12:01.922 --> 12:04.158
The soil around here
is a mixture of sandy loam,

12:04.192 --> 12:05.793
gravel, granite,
river wash

12:05.826 --> 12:08.462
and black adobe.
Any weight over three tons

12:08.496 --> 12:10.398
around a preexisting hole
could create

12:10.431 --> 12:11.799
a cave-in not unlike

12:11.832 --> 12:13.901
a cover-subsidence sinkhole.

12:13.934 --> 12:16.504
That fire truck is
16,200 pounds,

12:16.537 --> 12:17.805
or 8.1 tons.

12:17.838 --> 12:19.340
Okay, I get it.

12:19.373 --> 12:20.574
You're smart.

12:20.608 --> 12:21.709
Yeah, we're also vindictive.

12:21.742 --> 12:23.344
You let the mutt go kaput,

12:23.377 --> 12:25.913
every news outlet in L.A.
will know the name Salerno.

12:28.416 --> 12:30.218
Hey! Back up.

12:30.251 --> 12:31.619
Truck's too heavy.

12:32.453 --> 12:33.487
(truck beeping)

12:37.258 --> 12:39.360
HAPPY:
Okay. Give me the specs.

12:39.393 --> 12:41.195
Uh, well, about 20 feet deep.

12:41.229 --> 12:42.530
Uh, two feet wide.

12:42.563 --> 12:43.397
All right.
I can squeeze down there.

12:43.431 --> 12:44.965
No. Are you crazy?
How do you expect

12:44.998 --> 12:46.400
to turn around
and get back up?

12:46.434 --> 12:49.470
Monty? Monty!
That's my dog down there!

12:49.503 --> 12:50.871
It's okay, baby, I'm here.

12:50.904 --> 12:52.373
(whimpers)

12:52.406 --> 12:54.742
He got loose and ran off.
I was looking for him,

12:54.775 --> 12:55.976
and a neighbor said
that they heard

12:56.009 --> 12:57.511
he was in a hole over here.

12:57.545 --> 12:58.612
Hi. I'm Paige.

12:58.646 --> 12:59.947
We're government contractors.

12:59.980 --> 13:01.582
For now. What's your name?

13:01.615 --> 13:03.217
Uh, Jane. Look, you got
to get him out fast.

13:03.251 --> 13:05.453
He has type 1 diabetes
and he needs his shot.

13:05.486 --> 13:06.587
When was his last dose?

13:06.620 --> 13:07.588
Little over 12 hours ago.

13:07.621 --> 13:08.989
Weight?
12 pounds.

13:09.022 --> 13:10.591
Last time he ate?
Last night.

13:10.624 --> 13:12.393
I was gonna feed him
after our morning walk.

13:12.426 --> 13:14.362
Okay, this is all bad. We got
a lightweight, diabetic dog

13:14.395 --> 13:17.365
with nothing in his stomach
who's past due on his insulin.

13:17.398 --> 13:19.767
His blood sugar's rising,
so rough calculation,

13:19.800 --> 13:22.470
it'll be at a lethal level
in, like, 28 minutes,

13:22.503 --> 13:23.637
Monty will be a goner.

13:23.671 --> 13:25.639
Oh, my God.
This is all my fault.

13:25.673 --> 13:27.608
I should've got a collar
that fit him better.

13:27.641 --> 13:28.542
Well, that's in the past.
There's no point

13:28.576 --> 13:30.210
in stressing over things
you can't control.

13:31.279 --> 13:32.980
Have you heard of Mickey Rivers?

13:33.013 --> 13:33.914
Not now.

13:33.947 --> 13:35.483
No, I'm just saying
that this situation

13:35.516 --> 13:39.487
we can control,
starting with this collar.

13:39.520 --> 13:41.355
This ankle collar.

13:41.389 --> 13:43.657
Do you recognize it,
Director Carson?

13:43.691 --> 13:45.493
Yes. Some call it a cuff.

13:45.526 --> 13:47.661
It's what was placed
on Mark Collins.

13:47.695 --> 13:48.662
And its purpose?

13:48.696 --> 13:50.631
To prevent his escape.

13:50.664 --> 13:52.633
We put one on him
upon his release from prison.

13:52.666 --> 13:55.303
Now, did you approve
this release?

13:55.336 --> 13:58.406
I did, but was initially
against it.

13:58.439 --> 13:59.740
Gallo pushed.

13:59.773 --> 14:01.409
Vehemently.

14:01.442 --> 14:02.910
Now I know why.

14:02.943 --> 14:04.912
He was getting paid off
by Collins.

14:04.945 --> 14:06.447
Objection! Non-responsive,

14:06.480 --> 14:08.449
lacks foundation,
speculative,

14:08.482 --> 14:09.583
and he's being a jerk.

14:09.617 --> 14:11.051
JUDGE:
Sustained, but,

14:11.084 --> 14:14.555
Counselor... settle down.

14:16.490 --> 14:18.626
JANE: Settle down, Monty,
you're gonna be fine.

14:18.659 --> 14:21.529
You're gonna be fine.

14:21.562 --> 14:22.930
Sly looks pretty agitated.

14:22.963 --> 14:25.599
Paige, we can't control
the trial,

14:25.633 --> 14:28.569
but we can surely control
how Monty is going to be lured

14:28.602 --> 14:31.739
into his new doggie elevator.

14:31.772 --> 14:33.741
I got the collar fixed
like a handle.

14:33.774 --> 14:34.742
Got Happy's extension cord.

14:34.775 --> 14:36.844
Should be long enough
to reach the little fella.

14:36.877 --> 14:38.579
Now time for the bait.

14:42.049 --> 14:43.283
It's really good bait.

14:43.317 --> 14:45.619
We're supposed to be using the
peanut butter to save the dog.

14:45.653 --> 14:46.720
He's got enough.

14:47.921 --> 14:50.558
Judge, I request permission
to put this cuff on your wrist.

14:50.591 --> 14:52.393
(quietly):
Oh, crap.

14:52.426 --> 14:54.462
For what possible purpose?

14:54.495 --> 14:56.864
My client is accused
of having the criminal intent,

14:56.897 --> 14:59.032
or mens re if you will,

14:59.066 --> 15:01.635
to help Mark
Collins escape.

15:01.669 --> 15:04.438
I can demonstrate that removing
the cuff is simple.

15:04.472 --> 15:07.741
It would take a mere second
or two, and, hence,

15:07.775 --> 15:09.743
could be done
in the heat of the moment

15:09.777 --> 15:11.879
with the world's fate
hanging in the balance,

15:11.912 --> 15:14.615
without any aforethought.

15:14.648 --> 15:15.949
Okay, fine.

15:15.983 --> 15:18.852
If you feel it helps
your case, step up.

15:20.921 --> 15:22.790
Thank you,
Your Honor.

15:23.824 --> 15:26.126
(clicking)

15:26.159 --> 15:28.762
And now, to unlock it.

15:29.930 --> 15:32.600
Oh, no.

15:32.633 --> 15:34.968
I seem to have
misplaced the keys.

15:35.002 --> 15:37.505
Uh, my briefcase.

15:39.907 --> 15:41.141
What the hell are you doing?

15:41.174 --> 15:42.876
(whispers): It's called
demonstrative evidence.

15:42.910 --> 15:45.379
Only way he can know
what you saved Collins from

15:45.413 --> 15:46.614
is to feel it.

15:46.647 --> 15:47.781
Don't you dare.

15:47.815 --> 15:48.649
(electrical buzzing)

15:48.682 --> 15:50.751
(shouting)

15:52.653 --> 15:54.455
What the hell?
Oh, Sly.

15:54.488 --> 15:56.056
That is a problem.

15:56.089 --> 15:59.693
Oh, my goodness,
Your Honor, I am so sorry.

15:59.727 --> 16:02.630
I have the exhibit's remote
in here, and I accidentally...

16:02.663 --> 16:04.498
Get this damn thing off me!

16:04.532 --> 16:05.633
Right away,
Your Honor.

16:05.666 --> 16:06.967
Get it off me.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.636
(grunts)

16:10.871 --> 16:12.973
PAIGE:
Electrocuting the judge?

16:13.006 --> 16:15.809
There's not enough lavender
in the world to fix that.

16:15.843 --> 16:18.045
Okay, cords are connected.
Ready to lower this thing.

16:18.078 --> 16:19.780
Let's hustle.
Little guy's

16:19.813 --> 16:21.582
only got 23 minutes
if he doesn't get his shot.

16:21.615 --> 16:23.851
Jane and Paige,
video chat each other.

16:23.884 --> 16:25.653
Okay, now, when we lower this,

16:25.686 --> 16:26.987
the dog will smell
the peanut butter.

16:27.020 --> 16:28.456
He hasn't eaten
since last night.

16:28.489 --> 16:29.723
He's gonna be good and hungry.

16:29.757 --> 16:30.624
Uh, then he'll hear and

16:30.658 --> 16:32.826
see you on the phone,
speaking of which...

16:32.860 --> 16:34.795
Yeah, that should hold it.

16:34.828 --> 16:36.129
Could have used
more peanut butter,

16:36.163 --> 16:37.831
but somebody
ate it all.

16:37.865 --> 16:40.167
Here we go, nice and slow.

16:40.200 --> 16:43.170
Too fast,
and the cardboard will tear.

16:44.705 --> 16:47.675
(whimpering)

16:47.708 --> 16:48.976
(Jane sniffles)

16:49.009 --> 16:51.779
Can't believe I'm crying.

16:51.812 --> 16:54.582
He's actually
the first dog I ever had.

16:54.615 --> 16:57.818
I found him a few months
after my husband died.

16:57.851 --> 17:00.488
Oh, I'm s... I'm so sorry.

17:00.521 --> 17:02.823
John was sick

17:02.856 --> 17:04.858
and suffering,

17:04.892 --> 17:06.927
and now he isn't.

17:06.960 --> 17:09.229
But I was.

17:09.262 --> 17:12.666
I was grieving
and alone,

17:12.700 --> 17:15.869
and then I found that stupid dog
wandering around my block,

17:15.903 --> 17:19.106
sick as heck, and--
I don't know-- it's just

17:19.139 --> 17:22.075
having something to care
and worry about helped me

17:22.109 --> 17:24.812
take my mind off
my own troubles, you know?

17:24.845 --> 17:27.648
I think we can all
relate to that today.

17:31.084 --> 17:33.086
Hello?

17:40.894 --> 17:42.830
Mr. O'Brien?

17:54.975 --> 17:57.778
As His Honor applies
the numbing spray,

17:57.811 --> 18:00.080
may I point out
that the pain you felt

18:00.113 --> 18:01.281
is the exact pain

18:01.314 --> 18:03.851
that Mark Collins would have
experienced had it not been

18:03.884 --> 18:06.086
for the brave actions
of my client?

18:06.119 --> 18:07.521
Therefore, I would

18:07.555 --> 18:09.523
like to submit into evidence...

18:09.557 --> 18:11.024
your unfortunate accident.

18:11.058 --> 18:13.894
Mr. Dodd, first of all,

18:13.927 --> 18:16.930
pain is not a piece of evidence.

18:16.964 --> 18:20.200
Second, what I
experienced was painful,

18:20.233 --> 18:23.103
but the question before
the court is whether Mr. Gallo

18:23.136 --> 18:25.172
was protecting
his prisoner

18:25.205 --> 18:27.841
from cruel
and unusual punishment.

18:27.875 --> 18:32.813
As for "unusual," stun cuffs
are used all the time.

18:32.846 --> 18:35.048
And as for "cruel,"

18:35.082 --> 18:37.050
I'd say it was mean,

18:37.084 --> 18:40.253
'cause I suspect you
did that on purpose,

18:40.287 --> 18:42.590
though I can't prove it.

18:42.623 --> 18:44.825
That being said,

18:44.858 --> 18:50.097
there is a difference
between "mean" and "cruel."

18:50.130 --> 18:52.332
So you're gonna deny my defense?

18:52.365 --> 18:53.801
No.

18:53.834 --> 18:56.970
I already have denied
your defense.

18:59.372 --> 19:01.642
I messed up.

19:01.675 --> 19:03.977
It all comes down to your
testimony, our Hail Margaret.

19:04.011 --> 19:05.145
Our what?!

19:05.178 --> 19:06.914
You know,
our big last play.

19:06.947 --> 19:09.216
It's a Hail Mary.

19:09.249 --> 19:11.952
Oh, forget it.

19:12.986 --> 19:15.322
(Monty whimpering)

19:15.355 --> 19:17.725
JANE:
There he is!

19:17.758 --> 19:19.727
Hey, Monty! Come on!

19:19.760 --> 19:21.161
Come on, boy!
(whimpering)

19:21.194 --> 19:22.229
TOBY:
Come on, dog.

19:22.262 --> 19:23.831
He better get in there.

19:23.864 --> 19:25.666
He's got 20 minutes
until he's doggone.

19:25.699 --> 19:26.967
I don't get it.

19:27.000 --> 19:28.936
The peanut butter was just
three steps away from him.

19:28.969 --> 19:30.771
Maybe he's scared
you'd fight him for it.

19:31.972 --> 19:33.306
Oh, no, look.
He-he can't go in.

19:33.340 --> 19:35.743
His back leg's broken.

19:35.776 --> 19:38.345
Poor guy must've snapped it
when he fell. He can't move.

19:38.378 --> 19:40.347
Damn it!

19:40.380 --> 19:42.015
Walter, take it easy!

19:42.049 --> 19:43.851
No! This was supposed
to be something I didn't have

19:43.884 --> 19:45.886
to worry about today
because I could control it!

19:45.919 --> 19:46.920
Mickey Rivers is full of crap!

19:46.954 --> 19:48.789
Since when
do you curse like that?

19:48.822 --> 19:52.259
Since I have to watch a dog die
in a dried-out old cistern.

19:52.292 --> 19:55.062
Here. Happy, pull the box up.
We got to regroup.

19:59.066 --> 20:01.368
Ah, son of a...!

20:01.401 --> 20:03.637
Ugh!

20:04.305 --> 20:07.175
Aah! The cord tore a hole
in the cardboard!

20:07.208 --> 20:08.809
Oh, that could have
fallen on the hound.

20:08.842 --> 20:10.311
I suck today!

20:10.344 --> 20:12.346
Would you stop
beating yourself up?

20:12.380 --> 20:14.282
Yeah, especially since
you may have just saved Monty.

20:14.315 --> 20:15.449
Now don't
move that box.

20:15.483 --> 20:18.452
When it tilted,
the phone must have fallen,

20:18.486 --> 20:20.488
and the camera picked up
something on the ground.

20:20.521 --> 20:22.456
That's a drain!
So? What?

20:22.490 --> 20:25.326
So, we're not gonna have to
watch a dog die in a dried-out

20:25.359 --> 20:27.228
old cistern because
it's not gonna be dry for long.

20:27.261 --> 20:29.297
What the crap
are you talking about?

20:29.330 --> 20:31.132
What? I swear all the time.

20:31.165 --> 20:32.633
What I'm saying is,
we can save the dog.

20:32.666 --> 20:34.302
We just have to drown it first.

20:36.737 --> 20:38.072
(whimpering)

20:42.843 --> 20:44.512
Filling the hole with water--
that could actually work!

20:44.545 --> 20:46.814
I'm sorry, but I want my dog
back up here alive.

20:46.847 --> 20:48.482
No, you don't understand.
When I saw the drain,

20:48.516 --> 20:50.151
I thought about water.
When I thought about water,

20:50.184 --> 20:51.852
I realized
that we could gently lift him up

20:51.885 --> 20:53.787
on a hydro elevator instead
of one made of cardboard.

20:53.821 --> 20:54.922
You said he can't walk.

20:54.955 --> 20:57.391
How do you expect him
to paddle 20 feet vertically?

20:57.425 --> 20:58.859
'Cause Monty's front legs
aren't injured.

20:58.892 --> 21:01.829
His light weight and buoyancy
means he only needs 4.54 joules

21:01.862 --> 21:03.364
of energy to remain afloat.

21:03.397 --> 21:05.833
That's .001
kilocalories.

21:05.866 --> 21:07.835
He has that in him,
even in a weak state.

21:07.868 --> 21:09.137
But won't any water
we put down the hole

21:09.170 --> 21:10.204
just run out of the grate?

21:10.238 --> 21:11.205
Not if we plug it.

21:11.239 --> 21:12.373
What? From up here?

21:12.406 --> 21:15.143
No! From down there!

21:15.176 --> 21:18.412
This cistern is networked
together with a group of

21:18.446 --> 21:20.348
other water-collecting pipes.

21:20.381 --> 21:23.284
They all drain
into a central water tank,

21:23.317 --> 21:24.218
and if we gain access
to the tank,

21:24.252 --> 21:26.487
we can plug the drain
from underground.

21:26.520 --> 21:27.421
I'll find the holding tank.

21:27.455 --> 21:31.159
Uh, we'll need a sealant
and water source.

21:31.192 --> 21:32.793
Okay, there is
a construction site. Come on.

21:32.826 --> 21:34.862
Hey, bro!

21:34.895 --> 21:36.497
Can we bum some cement?

21:36.530 --> 21:37.498
No.

21:37.531 --> 21:39.333
Come on, man,
w-we're trying to save a dog.

21:39.367 --> 21:41.535
I'm trying to feed a family.
Hit the bricks.

21:45.839 --> 21:48.142
That guy will beat your ass.

21:48.176 --> 21:49.377
Yeah, probably.

21:57.585 --> 21:59.420
You got to hurry.
Monty's not doing well,

21:59.453 --> 22:00.854
and according to Toby's count,
(cries out)

22:00.888 --> 22:03.491
he's got 16 minutes
if he doesn't get the medicine.

22:03.524 --> 22:04.492
What the hell are you doing?

22:04.525 --> 22:06.294
I'm trying to find...
(echoing metallic clang)

22:06.327 --> 22:07.795
Oh! You hear that?

22:07.828 --> 22:09.330
Hear the hollow?

22:09.363 --> 22:10.431
It's the underground tank
collection.

22:10.464 --> 22:11.632
It's the keystone.

22:11.665 --> 22:13.801
Now we just have to pop it in,

22:13.834 --> 22:15.336
and I can get down there.

22:15.369 --> 22:17.171
Walter O'Brien, right?
Yeah, who are you?

22:17.205 --> 22:18.306
Clarence Mickelthorn.

22:18.339 --> 22:19.773
We had a meeting
scheduled for today.

22:19.807 --> 22:22.476
Oh, wow, um...

22:22.510 --> 22:24.878
Mr. Mickelthorn, I-I'm
so sorry we weren't able

22:24.912 --> 22:26.180
to meet you at the garage.

22:26.214 --> 22:27.615
We got held up here with a...

22:27.648 --> 22:29.283
a very important case.

22:29.317 --> 22:30.551
Yeah, puppy in a hole.

22:30.584 --> 22:32.253
Can you stop that
while I'm speaking to you?

22:32.286 --> 22:33.921
Can't. Monty's on a clock.

22:33.954 --> 22:35.389
How did you know
where to find us?

22:35.423 --> 22:37.358
Tracked your cells.
I'm Homeland.

22:37.391 --> 22:38.492
I got the cement!

22:38.526 --> 22:39.927
More like stole the cement.

22:39.960 --> 22:40.794
Oh, God.

22:40.828 --> 22:41.895
You stole that material?

22:41.929 --> 22:43.897
Who's the suit?
Um, Happy, Toby,

22:43.931 --> 22:46.467
this is Mr. Mickelthorn
from Homeland.

22:46.500 --> 22:47.901
Oh, the poor man's Cabe.

22:47.935 --> 22:48.836
Thief!

22:48.869 --> 22:50.538
I'm gonna kick your ass.

22:50.571 --> 22:51.472
HAPPY: Oh, I could
have predicted this.

22:52.673 --> 22:53.641
Hi. I-I know

22:53.674 --> 22:55.609
he stole your things,
but a big guy like you

22:55.643 --> 22:57.278
beating up on a pencil neck?

22:57.311 --> 22:58.979
You know,

22:59.012 --> 23:00.414
what do you...
what do you get out of that?

23:00.448 --> 23:01.915
It'll make me happy.

23:01.949 --> 23:03.584
Oh, let's go, meathead.
I can kind of box,

23:03.617 --> 23:04.652
and I kick some mean gooty.

23:04.685 --> 23:05.919
Not helpful, Toby.

23:05.953 --> 23:07.988
Sir, can I just show you this?

23:08.021 --> 23:10.424
Um, there is a dog trapped
in that cistern over there,

23:10.458 --> 23:12.726
and-and I know, I know
you don't want him to die

23:12.760 --> 23:15.729
over a-a few supplies.

23:15.763 --> 23:17.598
(whines)

23:17.631 --> 23:18.799
Just bring 'em back.

23:18.832 --> 23:20.701
This woman saved you a beatdown.

23:20.734 --> 23:21.669
Eh, go pop your pecs.

23:21.702 --> 23:22.736
Shut up, Toby.

23:22.770 --> 23:24.305
Don't blame him.
It's my fault.

23:24.338 --> 23:25.906
I shouldn't have let
him swipe the stuff.

23:25.939 --> 23:27.541
And you shut up, too.

23:27.575 --> 23:28.942
You've been berating yourself
about everything.

23:28.976 --> 23:30.878
That's not who you are.
You're mean

23:30.911 --> 23:32.613
and judgmental,
and that's what makes you tick.

23:32.646 --> 23:33.614
And you're not a daredevil,

23:33.647 --> 23:35.583
so stop riding unicycles
and jumping out of cars

23:35.616 --> 23:37.418
and running in front
of fire trucks

23:37.451 --> 23:38.552
and-and picking fights.

23:38.586 --> 23:39.753
(muffled):
She's right.

23:39.787 --> 23:41.255
You have been careless.

23:41.289 --> 23:42.155
And you.

23:42.189 --> 23:43.291
I should tell you
to shut your mouth,

23:43.324 --> 23:45.493
but its been full since
we left Cabe at the courthouse.

23:45.526 --> 23:47.428
You're stress-eating your way
through this trial,

23:47.461 --> 23:48.929
literally consuming anxiety.

23:48.962 --> 23:51.399
You're engaging in risky
behavior to distract yourself

23:51.432 --> 23:52.866
since you can't gamble
your stress away.

23:52.900 --> 23:55.569
And since you can't build Cabe
a way out of his problem,

23:55.603 --> 23:56.404
you are punishing yourself

23:56.437 --> 23:57.438
instead of being nasty
to everyone

23:57.471 --> 23:59.707
like normal. In short,
your coping mechanisms suck.

23:59.740 --> 24:01.275
So, if you want to help on a day

24:01.309 --> 24:02.810
where you feel helpless,
get your act together,

24:02.843 --> 24:04.712
save the damn dog, 'cause we
only have 13 and a half minutes.

24:04.745 --> 24:05.846
WALTER:
She's right.

24:05.879 --> 24:08.482
Happy, get your winch
on the keystone and yank it out.

24:08.516 --> 24:09.783
Copy that, fatty.

24:09.817 --> 24:10.584
Yo, goober, make
yourself useful.

24:10.618 --> 24:13.554
Hook that hose up
to that spigot.

24:13.587 --> 24:16.790
That's the Happy I know.

24:16.824 --> 24:19.660
Mr. Gallo, this trial boils down

24:19.693 --> 24:21.562
to one simple question:

24:21.595 --> 24:24.498
did you conspire
to help Mark Collins escape?

24:24.532 --> 24:26.900
Absolutely not.

24:26.934 --> 24:28.736
Then what did you do that day,

24:28.769 --> 24:31.405
that moment
when you uncuffed him?

24:31.439 --> 24:34.442
What I was trained to do

24:34.475 --> 24:36.510
ever since I watched my father

24:36.544 --> 24:39.380
put on the shield and holster
every morning.

24:39.413 --> 24:42.583
I helped another human being.

24:42.616 --> 24:44.485
If I'd have left that cuff on,

24:44.518 --> 24:47.621
Collins would have suffered.

24:47.655 --> 24:48.756
All due respect, Judge.

24:48.789 --> 24:49.890
Collins would have had the juice

24:49.923 --> 24:51.559
a lot longer than
the few seconds

24:51.592 --> 24:52.593
that you felt today.

24:52.626 --> 24:54.362
It would have been torture.

24:54.395 --> 24:56.664
I know it sounds corny nowadays,

24:56.697 --> 24:58.632
but I was raised
to do what's right,

24:58.666 --> 25:01.669
to protect and serve,
to help others.

25:01.702 --> 25:03.637
It's my life's work.

25:03.671 --> 25:06.640
It's what my dad did.

25:06.674 --> 25:10.578
And I would not sully my office,

25:10.611 --> 25:13.981
my honor, or my family name

25:14.014 --> 25:15.716
by intentionally helping
a criminal

25:15.749 --> 25:17.084
escape from justice.

25:17.117 --> 25:20.721
No more questions.

25:20.754 --> 25:21.922
Ms. Dine.

25:23.724 --> 25:25.626
Mr. Gallo, please read

25:25.659 --> 25:27.695
the amount of this deposit
into your account

25:27.728 --> 25:29.463
on 11/27/17.

25:29.497 --> 25:30.664
Objection. Not his account.

25:30.698 --> 25:31.765
I contest this line
of questioning.

25:31.799 --> 25:34.835
That's funny, because account
has Mr. Gallo's name

25:34.868 --> 25:36.570
and Mr. Gallo's Social
Security number.

25:36.604 --> 25:38.606
Overruled.

25:38.639 --> 25:40.040
Mr. Gallo, please answer.

25:40.073 --> 25:43.577
$50,000.

25:43.611 --> 25:45.846
That's a lot of money
for a government employee.

25:45.879 --> 25:48.416
In your experience
in law enforcement,

25:48.449 --> 25:50.618
have you seen people
commit crimes

25:50.651 --> 25:52.753
for 50 grand?

25:52.786 --> 25:54.021
Less?

25:54.054 --> 25:56.123
I know what you're trying to do.
Mr. Gallo.

25:56.156 --> 25:57.958
You're trying to make it seem
like I took a bribe. Mr. Gallo.

25:57.991 --> 26:00.127
I've never been on the take!
Mr. Gallo, enough!

26:00.160 --> 26:01.695
Your Honor, my lawyer
submitted a brief

26:01.729 --> 26:03.497
showing how easy it is

26:03.531 --> 26:05.966
to hack into a bank account.

26:05.999 --> 26:08.436
You got to believe me, Judge.

26:08.469 --> 26:10.671
That day on the ice,

26:10.704 --> 26:13.040
I was enforcing the law
on my own.

26:13.073 --> 26:14.775
With no help

26:14.808 --> 26:16.143
on an island.

26:17.678 --> 26:19.747
Your Honor,
I need a continuance.

26:19.780 --> 26:21.649
A continuance? Are you crazy?

26:21.682 --> 26:23.584
I have a Hail Margaret. A Mary.

26:23.617 --> 26:25.819
I have a Hail Mary
that will exonerate my client.

26:25.853 --> 26:29.122
You can have 15 minutes.

26:36.630 --> 26:38.466
I see the pipe to the cistern.

26:38.499 --> 26:40.734
Cement's almost ready,
but Monty's only got

26:40.768 --> 26:42.803
about 11 minutes, and this
won't harden fast enough.

26:42.836 --> 26:44.805
Uh, that is why I called her.
What's this?

26:44.838 --> 26:46.607
It's okay. She's with us.

26:46.640 --> 26:48.509
Got the plasticizer.

26:48.542 --> 26:49.877
This will increase
dry time by five.

26:49.910 --> 26:51.044
Happy, no time

26:51.078 --> 26:53.581
for the harness. I'll grab
the cable, just lower me in.

26:53.614 --> 26:55.849
Winches. Cop cars.
Chemical additives.

26:55.883 --> 26:57.918
All this is for a dog?

26:57.951 --> 26:59.219
Oh, I see.

26:59.252 --> 27:00.654
Very cute.

27:00.688 --> 27:02.623
We should totally save this dog.

27:02.656 --> 27:03.791
She's not in my file.

27:03.824 --> 27:04.825
Are you part of Scorpion?

27:04.858 --> 27:06.627
(scoffs) Absolutely not.

27:06.660 --> 27:07.761
TOBY:
Okay.

27:07.795 --> 27:09.930
It's ready. Oh.
(phone rings)

27:09.963 --> 27:11.732
Oh, boy, it's Sly.

27:11.765 --> 27:12.733
Hey, pal. What's the news?

27:12.766 --> 27:13.967
Cabe has a shot, but you need

27:14.001 --> 27:15.736
to get me a copy
of a specific case.

27:15.769 --> 27:17.705
It's not online?
No, the book is too old

27:17.738 --> 27:18.572
and obscure.

27:18.606 --> 27:20.641
Only a few law libraries
still carry it,

27:20.674 --> 27:22.643
including Braddock University
in downtown.

27:22.676 --> 27:25.479
It's U.S. v. Bramm
in the 1749 to 1855

27:25.513 --> 27:28.749
Treatise on Maritime Common Law.

27:28.782 --> 27:29.783
You have 14 minutes

27:29.817 --> 27:30.751
to scan it and e-mail it to me.

27:30.784 --> 27:32.486
That's less time than Monty has.

27:32.520 --> 27:33.654
Who's Monty?
WALTER: The dog we're saving

27:33.687 --> 27:35.689
instead of doing interviews
with Clarence.

27:35.723 --> 27:36.590
Who's Clarence?!

27:36.624 --> 27:38.125
He's the new Cabe if
you lose this case,

27:38.158 --> 27:39.660
and he'll probably
shut us down.

27:39.693 --> 27:41.762
You ask me,
he looks like a putz.

27:41.795 --> 27:42.863
SYLVESTER:
Just find the book!

27:42.896 --> 27:44.197
Copy that, Counselor.

27:44.231 --> 27:45.799
Flo, you drive.

27:45.833 --> 27:47.935
Fine. And it's Florence.

27:47.968 --> 27:49.269
Okay, Happy, I'm ready.

27:49.302 --> 27:51.004
Drop me in the tank.

27:51.038 --> 27:52.806
(siren wailing)

27:52.840 --> 27:53.941
(tires screech)

27:55.175 --> 27:56.043
Freeze!

27:57.845 --> 27:58.946
Is there a problem, Officer?

27:58.979 --> 28:00.848
You ran three red lights.

28:00.881 --> 28:03.016
I've had my lights on
for four blocks.

28:03.050 --> 28:04.752
It's an emergency.

28:04.785 --> 28:05.853
Um, I didn't know.

28:05.886 --> 28:07.788
Don't want to hear it. Hands up.

28:09.823 --> 28:12.192
You ready to take
one for the team?

28:12.225 --> 28:13.927
I've already made myself
absolutely clear

28:13.961 --> 28:15.729
that I am not
a part of this team.

28:16.897 --> 28:19.066
But fine.

28:19.099 --> 28:20.768
Okay. Run.

28:21.869 --> 28:23.503
Get the girl. I got him.

28:32.312 --> 28:33.280
Hi! Excuse me!

28:33.313 --> 28:34.214
I need the 1749 to 1855...
Shh.

28:34.247 --> 28:36.684
(quietly):
Treatise on Maritime Common Law.

28:37.818 --> 28:39.152
It's in our new
rare text display

28:39.186 --> 28:42.289
in the Brandeis Wing.
Thank you!

28:42.322 --> 28:43.256
OFFICER:
Stop him!

28:45.225 --> 28:47.194
Shh.

28:49.229 --> 28:51.932
I'm coming, Monty.
Hang in there.

28:51.965 --> 28:54.802
(Monty whining)

29:01.842 --> 29:03.143
How does he look?

29:03.176 --> 29:06.847
Cold and dirty, like me.

29:08.081 --> 29:10.117
It seems today...

29:10.150 --> 29:11.952
is your day.

29:11.985 --> 29:13.153
We were looking

29:13.186 --> 29:18.325
for a distraction.

29:18.358 --> 29:21.862
And you were it.

29:21.895 --> 29:22.696
(whines)

29:22.730 --> 29:26.066
Okay, "distraction"
is a harsh word.

29:27.367 --> 29:29.102
And looking at your face,
I can see

29:29.136 --> 29:31.338
that you're a creature
with merit.

29:31.371 --> 29:34.274
So thank you.

29:34.307 --> 29:36.644
You see...

29:36.677 --> 29:39.279
my team and I,

29:39.312 --> 29:41.649
we're worried about our friend,

29:41.682 --> 29:44.885
and we, uh, we don't know
if we can save him.

29:44.918 --> 29:48.055
But he's being brave.

29:48.088 --> 29:50.257
As always.

29:50.290 --> 29:51.925
As are you.

29:58.231 --> 30:00.367
Okay, Monty.

30:00.400 --> 30:01.869
Now I'm gonna seal this up.

30:01.902 --> 30:03.871
That doesn't mean
that I'm leaving you.

30:03.904 --> 30:06.173
That means

30:06.206 --> 30:07.875
that you're coming home,
okay, buddy?

30:07.908 --> 30:09.910
(whines)

30:13.413 --> 30:14.648
Let's start up the water.

30:18.418 --> 30:20.187
(whining)

30:20.220 --> 30:22.289
JANE:
It's okay, baby.

30:22.322 --> 30:24.124
You need to swim. You can do it.

30:24.157 --> 30:26.026
So, opening
an abandoned holding tank,

30:26.059 --> 30:27.294
flooding municipal cisterns.

30:27.327 --> 30:29.129
You guys ever get permission
for stuff like this,

30:29.162 --> 30:31.398
or you just do
whatever the hell you want?

30:31.431 --> 30:32.966
Clarence, can we please
discuss protocol later?

30:33.000 --> 30:33.967
(cries out) Look!

30:34.001 --> 30:35.635
He's doing it. He's paddling.

30:38.471 --> 30:40.407
SYLVESTER:
Toby, I need that case.

30:40.440 --> 30:41.842
Look, I'm trying, man.

30:41.875 --> 30:43.143
I got the fuzz on my tail.

30:43.176 --> 30:45.278
(mumbles)

30:45.312 --> 30:46.914
(snaps fingers)

30:50.851 --> 30:51.885
Oh, no.

30:51.919 --> 30:53.721
"Oh, no"? Why "oh, no"?

30:53.754 --> 30:55.122
Cabe's freedom's under glass.

30:55.155 --> 30:56.223
What does that mean?

30:58.091 --> 31:00.027
Oh, God.

31:00.060 --> 31:01.328
(whimpers)

31:03.931 --> 31:05.733
Come on, come on.

31:05.766 --> 31:08.035
Oh! U.S. v. Bramm.

31:08.068 --> 31:09.036
(camera clicks)

31:09.069 --> 31:10.270
Yeah.
Aah!

31:10.303 --> 31:11.839
Hello?

31:11.872 --> 31:14.908
(whining)

31:14.942 --> 31:16.910
That's it, sweetheart.
Keep going.

31:16.944 --> 31:18.011
He'll be up soon.
Get the insulin ready.

31:18.045 --> 31:19.847
I can't believe this is working.

31:22.115 --> 31:24.417
How's it going?

31:24.451 --> 31:26.019
Uh...

31:26.053 --> 31:27.788
dog seems to be keeping
his head above water.

31:27.821 --> 31:29.022
Cabe, not so much.

31:29.056 --> 31:30.991
JUDGE:
Your counsel isn't back.

31:31.024 --> 31:32.893
What do you think
his issue could be?

31:32.926 --> 31:34.728
U.S. v. Bramm, Judge.

31:34.762 --> 31:35.796
U.S. v. Bramm.

31:35.829 --> 31:38.866
I assume you're citing a case?

31:38.899 --> 31:40.300
Not just any case, Your Honor.

31:40.333 --> 31:42.069
The 1804 case that requires you

31:42.102 --> 31:43.904
to dismiss all charges
against my client.

31:43.937 --> 31:46.439
1804? What is going on here?

31:46.473 --> 31:47.775
My client stated

31:47.808 --> 31:49.009
figuratively

31:49.042 --> 31:51.444
that he was on an island
out there with Collins.

31:51.478 --> 31:52.980
What he didn't realize

31:53.013 --> 31:54.915
is that he actually was
on an island.

31:54.948 --> 31:56.149
There was a crack in the ice

31:56.183 --> 31:57.985
that Cabe had to leap over

31:58.018 --> 32:00.153
because Collins
was faking an ankle injury.

32:00.187 --> 32:01.822
These are all facts
the prosecution

32:01.855 --> 32:02.923
has already stipulated to.

32:02.956 --> 32:04.191
How is any of this relevant?

32:04.224 --> 32:05.826
U.S. v. Bramm.

32:05.859 --> 32:07.995
Bramm was a ship's captain
transporting prisoners.

32:08.028 --> 32:10.130
And the ship hit rough waters,
it was in danger of sinking,

32:10.163 --> 32:13.967
so Bramm unshackled his
prisoners so they would live.

32:14.001 --> 32:16.069
Eventually, the ship
limped to port

32:16.103 --> 32:18.005
and many of the
prisoners escaped.

32:18.038 --> 32:21.909
But Bramm was acquitted of
aiding the escape of a prisoner.

32:21.942 --> 32:24.978
And it was held that
a captain of a vessel

32:25.012 --> 32:28.115
has a right to take
"all due action"

32:28.148 --> 32:30.851
to protect prisoners in duress.

32:30.884 --> 32:32.920
Mr. Gallo wasn't on a vessel.
SYLVESTER: Au contraire.

32:32.953 --> 32:35.155
The split in the ice

32:35.188 --> 32:37.190
created an independent
floating entity:

32:37.224 --> 32:38.959
an ice floe.

32:38.992 --> 32:41.862
Mr. Gallo was in charge
of Mr. Collins;

32:41.895 --> 32:43.063
hence, a de facto captain.

32:43.096 --> 32:45.298
Under Bramm,
he had every legal right

32:45.332 --> 32:47.935
to let his prisoner go
when he faced peril.

32:47.968 --> 32:49.903
Your Honor,

32:49.937 --> 32:53.240
it's old law, it's weird law,

32:53.273 --> 32:56.476
but it's still the law.

32:56.509 --> 32:57.444
This is preposterous.

32:57.477 --> 32:59.947
Okay, if there's nothing else,

32:59.980 --> 33:02.983
I'm gonna return to chambers
and consider all of this.

33:03.016 --> 33:04.151
But, Mr. Dodd,

33:04.184 --> 33:07.955
I share the prosecution's
reservations.

33:07.988 --> 33:09.422
Don't go far.

33:12.025 --> 33:13.326
Come on, boy.
Come on, baby.

33:13.360 --> 33:14.862
Come on!
PAIGE: You can do it.

33:14.895 --> 33:16.263
JANE: Come on.
PAIGE: Come on, baby. Come on.

33:16.296 --> 33:17.865
(Monty whines)

33:17.898 --> 33:19.466
Come on, buddy, keep going.
He's not gonna make it.

33:19.499 --> 33:20.567
He's too weak.

33:20.600 --> 33:22.936
Here. (grunts)

33:22.970 --> 33:24.104
He's going under!

33:24.137 --> 33:27.174
WALTER: (grunts)
Come on, buddy.

33:27.207 --> 33:28.842
I got to get deeper.

33:28.876 --> 33:30.277
I can't get him.

33:30.310 --> 33:31.478
(shouts)
He's drowning!

33:31.511 --> 33:34.014
WALTER:
Come on!

33:40.620 --> 33:42.555
(grunts)

33:42.589 --> 33:44.124
I couldn't reach him.
I'm so sorry.

33:44.157 --> 33:46.093
I-I thought this was something
I could control.

33:50.197 --> 33:52.565
That's it?
Y-You just give up?

33:52.599 --> 33:54.634
Every file I read
about your team

33:54.667 --> 33:56.870
was what renegade geniuses
you are.

33:56.904 --> 33:58.305
You got to figure it out.

33:58.338 --> 34:00.040
There's a dog down there.
He needs air.

34:00.073 --> 34:01.608
Wait. You're right.
He does need air.

34:01.641 --> 34:03.443
But not oxygen-- car exhaust.

34:03.476 --> 34:05.345
Well, he can't breathe
car exhaust.

34:05.378 --> 34:08.615
He's not gonna breathe the air,
he's gonna float on it.

34:08.648 --> 34:10.283
Okay, I'll connect the hose
to my exhaust.

34:10.317 --> 34:13.320
Magoo, gas it
when I say so.

34:13.353 --> 34:14.587
Now, Monty won't inhale exhaust

34:14.621 --> 34:16.023
because he's underwater
and not breathing.

34:16.056 --> 34:17.257
But when the engine revs,

34:17.290 --> 34:19.592
it'll pump the H2O
with so much CO2,

34:19.626 --> 34:22.662
that a-a torrent of gas pockets
will lift him right to the top.

34:22.695 --> 34:24.464
Okay, punch it!

34:24.497 --> 34:25.865
(sniffs, engine revs)

34:27.167 --> 34:28.301
I see bubbles.

34:28.335 --> 34:29.302
It's not enough!

34:29.336 --> 34:30.603
Okay, floor it, jackass!

34:30.637 --> 34:32.639
(engine revs)

34:34.574 --> 34:37.610
JANE:
There he is. He's out.

34:37.644 --> 34:40.513
(Jane crying)

34:40.547 --> 34:43.016
Oh, he's not breathing.
Inject him.

34:47.154 --> 34:48.621
Come on.

34:48.655 --> 34:50.090
Come on.

34:50.123 --> 34:52.459
Nothing. Nothing.
Uh, he needs CPR.

34:52.492 --> 34:55.095
Oh. Try this.
Come on.

34:55.128 --> 34:57.430
It's too big. It
won't fit his face.

34:57.464 --> 34:58.631
I found this in
the cup holder.

34:58.665 --> 35:00.233
Oh. Give it.

35:04.337 --> 35:06.239
Come on, Monty.

35:06.273 --> 35:07.707
Come on,
Monty.

35:07.740 --> 35:09.476
Breathe for me.

35:09.509 --> 35:10.944
We need a win today, pal.

35:10.978 --> 35:11.979
Come on, baby.

35:12.012 --> 35:13.646
Come on, you stupid mutt.

35:13.680 --> 35:16.383
PAIGE: He's breathing!
(Monty whimpers)

35:16.416 --> 35:18.451
Hey.
Oh.

35:18.485 --> 35:22.389
Thank you for being the thing
we could fix.

35:23.423 --> 35:25.392
Yeah. Yep.

35:25.425 --> 35:27.494
(crying)

35:27.527 --> 35:31.431
Oh, yes, honey.
(smooches)

35:31.464 --> 35:32.632
Oh, thank you so much.

35:32.665 --> 35:35.635
(laughing)

35:35.668 --> 35:38.071
Funny, I made myself
this sandwich,

35:38.105 --> 35:40.207
and I can't eat.

35:42.275 --> 35:44.044
I hate saying
this, Cabe,

35:44.077 --> 35:45.078
but if things
don't go our way,

35:45.112 --> 35:47.014
they're just gonna cuff
you and take you out.

35:47.047 --> 35:48.148
Yeah, I know.

35:48.181 --> 35:49.316
So...

35:51.684 --> 35:53.987
I wanted to say...

35:54.021 --> 35:55.522
I'm sorry.

36:04.331 --> 36:07.067
Sly, I need your help
one last time.

36:09.102 --> 36:11.038
If I'm gonna be able
to get through

36:11.071 --> 36:12.205
the next seven years inside,

36:12.239 --> 36:13.673
I'm gonna need to know
that you're not

36:13.706 --> 36:17.244
out here beating yourself up
over it.

36:17.277 --> 36:21.614
I'm gonna need to hear you say
you did a good job.

36:21.648 --> 36:24.451
'Cause you did.

36:27.420 --> 36:28.788
I did a good job.

36:28.821 --> 36:30.257
You're damn straight you did.

36:32.559 --> 36:35.095
BAILIFF: Counselors,
the verdict is in.

36:35.128 --> 36:36.429
All rise.

36:39.332 --> 36:41.168
Be seated.

36:42.269 --> 36:43.803
This is a unique case.

36:43.836 --> 36:47.607
Prosecution claims that
the defendant received funds

36:47.640 --> 36:50.577
from an inmate
to facilitate an escape.

36:50.610 --> 36:53.480
Money was wired into
Mr. Gallo's account,

36:53.513 --> 36:56.183
but his attorney
supplied valid data--

36:56.216 --> 36:57.817
dense data--

36:57.850 --> 37:01.788
demonstrating how bank
security can be bested.

37:01.821 --> 37:04.724
So, that aspect of the case
is a wash.

37:06.393 --> 37:08.428
But what is clear

37:08.461 --> 37:12.599
is that Mr. Gallo uncuffed
Mark Collins, who then fled.

37:12.632 --> 37:16.436
So is he responsible
for aiding the escape?

37:16.469 --> 37:21.074
It depends on whether you
consider an ice floe a vessel.

37:22.375 --> 37:24.777
The ice Mr. Collins was on

37:24.811 --> 37:28.181
was a freestanding contrivance,

37:28.215 --> 37:30.617
which could sink, or drift away,

37:30.650 --> 37:34.521
or befall any hazard just
like any vessel on the sea.

37:34.554 --> 37:38.691
As such, under maritime law,

37:38.725 --> 37:42.395
Mr. Gallo was permitted
to unshackle his prisoner

37:42.429 --> 37:44.364
to protect him from harm.

37:44.397 --> 37:48.368
Therefore, I rule
that the defendant

37:48.401 --> 37:51.204
is not guilty
as a matter of law.

37:51.238 --> 37:53.841
Mr. Gallo, you are free to go.

37:53.874 --> 37:56.544
Yeah!
Oh.

37:58.011 --> 37:59.713
That's a good hug.
Not a good-bye hug.

37:59.747 --> 38:01.715
Cabe is innocent!
Oh, thank God!

38:01.749 --> 38:04.885
You're fired, but you
weren't completely useless.

38:04.918 --> 38:06.053
Thank you.

38:06.086 --> 38:08.989
I'll tell Homeland
that Scorpion

38:09.022 --> 38:10.324
is unconventional
but effective.

38:11.692 --> 38:14.462
All right. Let's get
to the courthouse.

38:16.364 --> 38:17.665
PAIGE:
There they are!

38:17.698 --> 38:20.368
Oh, I'm so glad this is over.

38:20.401 --> 38:22.403
Not half as glad as I am.

38:22.436 --> 38:24.405
Not a quarter
glad as I am.

38:24.438 --> 38:25.573
Mwah.

38:25.606 --> 38:27.908
Oh. (chuckles)

38:30.110 --> 38:31.445
CABE:
I got to tell you,

38:31.479 --> 38:32.746
I was a little worried
this morning

38:32.780 --> 38:35.449
with all that decaf tea
and the calypso music.

38:35.483 --> 38:37.485
Speaking of which, where's Doc?

38:39.453 --> 38:40.654
Uh, not good.

38:40.688 --> 38:42.423
What happened?

38:42.456 --> 38:43.824
Multiple moving violations.

38:43.857 --> 38:44.892
Destruction of property.

38:44.925 --> 38:46.360
Hey, Counselor, we're
gonna need your services.

38:46.394 --> 38:48.362
Oh, boy.

38:48.396 --> 38:51.965
I guess my law business
is really taking off. (laughs)

38:54.001 --> 38:55.135
PAIGE: How can you not have
fermented fish?

38:55.168 --> 38:56.537
We order from you every week.

38:56.570 --> 38:58.872
Well, keep it in stock
from now on.

38:58.906 --> 39:00.708
Stupid Kovelsky's.

39:03.611 --> 39:06.079
Um... Paige?

39:06.113 --> 39:07.448
I think maybe

39:07.481 --> 39:09.483
you keeping it
together for our sake

39:09.517 --> 39:11.585
never let you
express any stress

39:11.619 --> 39:13.421
you were feeling
for Cabe.

39:13.454 --> 39:15.122
Oh, boy.

39:15.155 --> 39:17.958
I need to apologize to
stupid Kovelsky's.

39:17.991 --> 39:18.826
Hey, how'd it go, guys?

39:18.859 --> 39:22.530
Our lawyer got us
community service.

39:22.563 --> 39:23.897
It's not a big deal.

39:23.931 --> 39:25.899
I shred my intern badge.

39:25.933 --> 39:27.401
Well, we should make
one for Flo, here.

39:27.435 --> 39:28.335
It's Florence.

39:28.368 --> 39:30.738
This one handled herself
like a champ today.

39:36.677 --> 39:38.779
I know we got off
on the wrong foot,

39:38.812 --> 39:43.116
but, um, you helped
keep my team together.

39:43.150 --> 39:44.752
So thank you.

39:48.822 --> 39:50.524
You're welcome.

39:51.925 --> 39:53.193
Okay.

39:53.226 --> 39:57.431
Since you're exonerated,
I guess you want these back.

39:57.465 --> 39:59.467
You guys can keep 'em.

39:59.500 --> 40:02.503
It's just my way of saying
how much you mean to me.

40:04.505 --> 40:08.208
Oh. Sir Ainsley
from Chair of Blades.

40:08.241 --> 40:11.479
The bravest knight
in all the realm.

40:11.512 --> 40:14.848
Well, you were brave to take
up the mantle to defend me.

40:14.882 --> 40:17.050
No way.

40:17.084 --> 40:19.019
A 1959 Gregory.

40:19.052 --> 40:20.688
They don't make them
like this anymore.

40:20.721 --> 40:22.723
I figure you could have
snuck that into the cake

40:22.756 --> 40:23.991
if I'd been convicted.

40:24.024 --> 40:27.127
You know I would.
This is old-school.

40:27.160 --> 40:29.029
Got an old
monogram inside.

40:29.062 --> 40:31.031
Yeah, that's my dad's initials.

40:31.064 --> 40:33.567
Cabe, I can't take
your father's hat.

40:33.601 --> 40:35.569
You made me get to the heart
of some stuff

40:35.603 --> 40:37.605
I needed to face, Doc.

40:37.638 --> 40:38.939
My old man would have liked you.

40:38.972 --> 40:42.109
I'd be honored
if you kept it.

40:42.142 --> 40:45.713
And an old copy of
Tech Talk Made Easy?

40:45.746 --> 40:47.548
I got that right after
I met Walter,

40:47.581 --> 40:48.649
when he was a little guy.

40:48.682 --> 40:50.918
I figured I'd never
understand what he was saying,

40:50.951 --> 40:53.554
but I at least wanted to be
able to speak the language.

40:53.587 --> 40:55.489
The one thing that gave me
comfort through all this,

40:55.523 --> 40:59.560
if I was going away,
was that they'd have you.

41:01.595 --> 41:02.896
Thanks, Cabe.

41:05.933 --> 41:07.601
An old letter?

41:07.635 --> 41:09.603
I figured it'd be easier
to give you that

41:09.637 --> 41:11.138
than to come out and say it.

41:13.841 --> 41:16.577
Well, Allie's waiting for me.

41:19.046 --> 41:21.615
I'll see you guys tomorrow.

41:24.251 --> 41:25.719
Thank you.

41:31.291 --> 41:32.860
What's that letter?

41:32.893 --> 41:35.596
Um, it's...

41:35.629 --> 41:38.566
the letter Cabe wrote
for my visa application.

41:38.599 --> 41:41.602
"To whom it may concern,
I write to you in regards

41:41.635 --> 41:44.938
"to Walter O'Brien, age 12,

41:44.972 --> 41:47.708
"whom I already know
will be the most...

41:50.744 --> 41:53.313
"...remarkable person
I'll meet in my lifetime.

41:53.346 --> 41:56.584
His intellect is surpassed
only by his character."

41:56.617 --> 41:59.920
Um, it continues on.

42:07.961 --> 42:10.063
He knew right away
how special you are.

42:13.233 --> 42:15.636
It's okay to be calm,

42:15.669 --> 42:18.338
to control what you can control.

42:18.371 --> 42:20.741
Mickey Rivers was right.

42:23.644 --> 42:26.346
But showing emotion
over someone you love,

42:26.379 --> 42:29.817
who loves you...

42:29.850 --> 42:31.719
that's okay, too.
