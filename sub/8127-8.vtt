  pay for yours.                

06:14.773 --> 06:16.774
            Shut up.            

06:16.776 --> 06:18.376
            Come on, Arch,      
            why are you uptight?

06:18.378 --> 06:20.411
         Took your mind off     
         the bills, didn't it?  

06:20.413 --> 06:21.579
        Here's something        
        for you here,           

06:21.581 --> 06:22.813
          and wouldn't you know,

06:22.815 --> 06:24.648
                    eight cents 
                    postage due.

06:24.650 --> 06:26.684
          Even his mail         
          is on the cuff, Edith.

06:26.686 --> 06:27.952
            Oh, boy.            

06:27.954 --> 06:30.121
          Will you go get supper
          on the table, huh?    

06:30.123 --> 06:31.589
Gloria,                         
let's set the table.            

06:31.591 --> 06:32.590
            All right, Ma.      

06:32.592 --> 06:34.658
                  Hey, Gloria...

06:34.660 --> 06:36.361
            I inherited $500.   

06:36.363 --> 06:37.661
             What?              

06:37.663 --> 06:39.998
What's that? You inherited $500?

06:40.000 --> 06:41.665
             Yeah, my           
             Uncle Alex died.   

06:41.667 --> 06:42.933
Who's Uncle Alex?               

06:42.935 --> 06:44.402
          Well, the last time   
          I saw him,            

06:44.404 --> 06:45.669
             I was around       
             8 years old.       

06:45.671 --> 06:46.770
            He was              
            the first Stivick   

06:46.772 --> 06:48.539
         to come over           
         from Poland to America.

06:48.541 --> 06:49.773
             He made it big here

06:49.775 --> 06:51.775
         and he sent money for  
         my father to come over.

06:51.777 --> 06:54.145
Ain't that interesting, Archie? 

06:54.147 --> 06:56.881
If it wasn't for his Uncle Alex,

06:56.883 --> 06:59.617
    Mike would be in Poland     
        right now.

07:09.128 --> 07:13.664
  Out of respect for the dead,  
 I ain't going to say nothing.  

07:13.666 --> 07:17.502
Michael, this check             
is only for $275.               

07:17.504 --> 07:18.636
             Yeah, well,        
             it explains here   

07:18.638 --> 07:20.004
        that they took out      
        the difference          

07:20.006 --> 07:21.372
          to recover my         
          uncle's back taxes.   

07:21.374 --> 07:22.540
Oh.                             

07:22.542 --> 07:24.442
          Gee, almost half.     
          I don't believe it.   

07:24.444 --> 07:25.576
Wow.                            

07:25.578 --> 07:27.545
    I never thought I'd live    
         to see the day         

07:27.547 --> 07:29.147
    when the meathead           
would have a tax problem.       

07:29.149 --> 07:30.948
            See, that's         
            the difference      

07:30.950 --> 07:32.383
between you and me, Arch.       

07:32.385 --> 07:34.952
I don't mind paying taxes       
if I know that the money's      

07:34.954 --> 07:36.487
going to be used                
for good things.                

07:36.489 --> 07:38.956
But do you know what Nixon's    
going to do with my money?      

07:38.958 --> 07:40.891
He's going to use it            
to buy a bomb                   

07:40.893 --> 07:42.126
and blow up                     
a Vietnamese village.           

07:42.128 --> 07:43.428
              That's for your   
              protection, buddy.

07:43.430 --> 07:44.595
             You want them gooks

07:44.597 --> 07:46.797
              riding the subways
              with you?         

07:48.767 --> 07:50.034
That's right, Arch.             

07:50.036 --> 07:51.635
That's every                    
Oriental's dream,               

07:51.637 --> 07:55.940
to ride the I.R.T.              

07:55.942 --> 07:58.076
        Michael, $275           
        is a lot of money.      

07:58.078 --> 08:00.511
         Are we going to        
         save it or spend it?   

08:00.513 --> 08:02.846
Well, I don't know.             
I got to think about it.        

08:02.848 --> 08:04.082
                 Uh, yeah, well,

08:04.084 --> 08:05.849
          maybe I could help you
          with that problem.    

08:05.851 --> 08:07.785
            Why don't you       
            look around, see?   

08:07.787 --> 08:10.921
        And find out if you     
        owe anybody anything.   

08:12.891 --> 08:15.526
                    And then pay
                    that person.

08:17.963 --> 08:19.897
I don't owe                     
anybody, Arch.                  

08:19.899 --> 08:20.998
                 Ho, ho, ho, ho!

08:23.569 --> 08:24.935
                  What about    
                  your landlord,

08:24.937 --> 08:27.105
                which happens   
                to be I?        

08:27.107 --> 08:28.706
            What about          
            living here free,   

08:28.708 --> 08:30.341
                 room and board,
                 for two years? 

08:30.343 --> 08:31.775
                Not to mention  
                the depreciation

08:31.777 --> 08:33.644
                 on your bedroom
                 up there.      

08:33.645 --> 08:35.246
Arch, I've been                 
keeping a record                

08:35.248 --> 08:36.514
of every penny                  
I owe you,                      

08:36.515 --> 08:38.149
but don't you                   
remember the deal?              

08:38.150 --> 08:39.717
I stay here                     
till I finish school            

08:39.719 --> 08:41.251
and get a job,                  

08:41.254 --> 08:43.453
and then I'll pay you back,     
with interest.                  

08:43.456 --> 08:44.622
                By the time     
                that happens,   

08:44.624 --> 08:46.290
        I'll be rooming         
        with your Uncle Alex.   

08:49.694 --> 08:50.861
Look, Arch...                   

08:50.863 --> 08:53.030
Arch, believe me, if there was  
an emergency here,              

08:53.032 --> 08:54.265
I'd give you                    
this check                      

08:54.267 --> 08:55.500
without thinking                
twice about it,                 

08:55.502 --> 08:56.734
but right now,                  

08:56.736 --> 08:58.802
I'd like to use the money       
for something special.          

08:58.804 --> 09:00.171
              Something special?
              What?             

09:00.173 --> 09:01.339
Well, like, uh...               

09:01.341 --> 09:02.573
      Like getting Gloria       

09:02.575 --> 09:03.774
        that winter coat        
      she's been needing.       

09:03.776 --> 09:04.775
Oh, Michael, really?            

09:04.777 --> 09:05.776
                        Yeah.   

09:05.778 --> 09:07.011
Oh, thank you, honey.           

09:07.013 --> 09:08.546
Oh, beautiful, beautiful.       
         A winter coat.         

09:08.548 --> 09:09.947
How much is that going to take? 

09:09.949 --> 09:10.948
                I don't know.   
                How much?       

09:10.950 --> 09:11.949
Uh, around $80.                 

09:11.951 --> 09:13.017
                         $80.   

09:13.019 --> 09:14.552
        Well, all right,        

09:14.554 --> 09:17.121
 what are you going to do with  
  the other 'round about $200?  

09:17.123 --> 09:18.456
Well, that I'd like to use      

09:18.458 --> 09:19.823
for something                   
really important.               

09:19.825 --> 09:21.592
                      Like what?

09:21.594 --> 09:23.528
         Like giving it         
to the McGovern campaign.       

09:30.068 --> 09:33.237
      Are you kidding me?       

09:33.239 --> 09:34.705
No, I'm not                     
kidding, Arch.                  

09:34.707 --> 09:36.774
There's a real emergency.       
Don't you see?                  

09:36.776 --> 09:38.643
The election's                  
only two weeks away             

09:38.645 --> 09:40.478
and they need                   
the money desperately.          

09:40.480 --> 09:41.546
              Do you mean to say

09:41.548 --> 09:43.314
            that you'd give $200
            to them people      

09:43.316 --> 09:45.449
        and forget all about    
        your own family here?   

09:45.451 --> 09:47.084
Arch, I'm doing it              
for my family,                  

09:47.086 --> 09:49.620
because I want to keep us       
living in a democracy.          

09:49.622 --> 09:51.389
              What the hell are 
              you talking about?

09:51.391 --> 09:53.023
I'm talking about the fact      

09:53.025 --> 09:54.425
that the Republicans            
have over $30 million,          

09:54.427 --> 09:56.227
while the Democrats             
had to put on a telethon        

09:56.229 --> 09:57.628
just to keep                    
their heads above water.        

09:57.630 --> 09:59.096
    Your head is under water!   

09:59.098 --> 10:00.231
              You hear this guy,
              Gloria?           

10:00.233 --> 10:01.732
Are you gonna stand there?      

10:01.734 --> 10:03.133
          You hear what your    
          husband is saying?    

10:03.135 --> 10:04.569
            You're going to     
            let him do that?    

10:04.571 --> 10:05.603
    Why not?                    

10:05.605 --> 10:06.804
            Arch, don't you see?

10:06.806 --> 10:08.072
                  The party     
                  with the money

10:08.074 --> 10:09.807
            can afford to buy   
            TV and radio time   

10:09.809 --> 10:11.642
        to get their message    
        across to the people.   

10:11.644 --> 10:13.511
         The other party        
         doesn't stand a chance!

10:13.513 --> 10:14.745
             Before you know it,

10:14.747 --> 10:16.046
        you've lost             
        the two-party system.   

10:16.048 --> 10:18.082
        Gee, it's getting       
        like politics in America

10:18.084 --> 10:19.283
        is only for the rich.   

10:19.285 --> 10:21.819
Who's been feeding you          
that commie crapola?            

10:21.821 --> 10:25.055
 President Eisenhower said that.

10:25.057 --> 10:26.390
He did not!                     

10:26.392 --> 10:27.891
Eisenhower was                  
a great president               

10:27.893 --> 10:29.827
who never                       
said nothing.                   

10:35.100 --> 10:36.701
    He did too, Daddy.          

10:36.703 --> 10:39.203
 Eisenhower made that statement 
            in 1968.            

10:39.205 --> 10:41.339
I saw it in the <i>Reader's Digest.</i>

10:41.341 --> 10:44.508
Oh! I wonder if they            
paid him $100.                  

10:46.445 --> 10:49.012
  And I wonder if you           

10:49.014 --> 10:50.715
  could get the supper          
  on the table!                 

10:52.751 --> 10:54.151
$200. I can't believe it.       

10:54.153 --> 10:56.387
        I can't believe         
      that you'd give $200      

10:56.389 --> 10:57.388
              to them McGoverns.

10:57.390 --> 10:58.556
Why not, Arch?                  

10:58.558 --> 11:00.358
I want to help him              
get his message across.         

11:00.360 --> 11:01.559
              I can tell you    
              McGovern's message

11:01.561 --> 11:02.893
                 in three words.
What?                           

11:02.895 --> 11:04.495
         "I wanna be president."

11:04.497 --> 11:05.963
                 Message ended. 

11:05.965 --> 11:07.632
         Well, McGovern         
      should be president.      

11:07.634 --> 11:10.534
Nixon hasn't kept               
any of his promises.            

11:10.536 --> 11:12.069
He promised                     
to end the war,                 

11:12.071 --> 11:14.639
to reduce unemployment          
and to stop inflation.          

11:14.641 --> 11:19.410
Don't be picking on a man       
over minor details like that!   

11:19.412 --> 11:21.412
         The American people    
         don't elect a president

11:21.414 --> 11:22.546
         over that stuff anyhow.

11:22.548 --> 11:24.014
            They don't like     
            a guy like McGovern,

11:24.016 --> 11:26.216
 who's running around           
 changing his mind all the time.

11:26.218 --> 11:30.087
They want a man like Nixon,     
who don't change for nothing.   

11:30.089 --> 11:32.657
 You're right about that, Arch. 

11:32.659 --> 11:34.625
        He keeps making         
    the same mistakes           

11:34.627 --> 11:36.761
      over and over again.      

11:36.763 --> 11:37.995
                         Listen,

11:37.997 --> 11:39.797
          I don't want to hear  
          nothing more from you,

11:39.799 --> 11:41.632
      because you've been       
      freeloading here off of me

11:41.634 --> 11:44.535
         for the last two years,
         I ain't said a word.   
What?!                          

11:44.537 --> 11:45.636
What are you                    
talking about?                  

11:45.638 --> 11:47.237
            Daddy, you pick     
            on him all the time!

11:47.239 --> 11:48.606
        All you've been doing   
        is complaining!         

11:48.608 --> 11:51.141
        Don't run away.         
 Don't run away from the facts. 

11:51.143 --> 11:53.143
For the first time in your life,
    a miracle happens.          

11:53.145 --> 11:55.313
 You get a little lump of dough 
         in your fist.          

11:55.315 --> 11:57.515
  You could do the right thing  
        and give it to me,      

11:57.517 --> 11:58.916
 but you don't see it that way. 

11:58.918 --> 12:00.918
        How does anybody        
      get through to you?       

12:00.920 --> 12:02.453
            Dinner!             

12:02.455 --> 12:05.923
  Oh, that's how they           
  get through to him!           

12:05.925 --> 12:08.225
          Look at him,          
     running for the chow,      

12:08.227 --> 12:10.961
            like Rin-Tin-Tin.   
Oh, Archie, give it up.         

12:10.963 --> 12:12.062
    Daddy,                      

12:12.064 --> 12:13.464
    if Michael wants            
    to give his money           

12:13.466 --> 12:15.466
    to a worthy cause,          
    that's his business.        

12:15.468 --> 12:17.100
            Listen,             
  where's your family feeling?  

12:17.102 --> 12:19.036
You went to Sunday school,      
        didn't you? Huh?        

12:19.038 --> 12:20.438
        Try and remember        
      what the Bible says       

12:20.440 --> 12:21.605
         about charity.         

12:21.607 --> 12:24.608
      "It's better to give      
    than to receive."           

12:24.610 --> 12:26.610
     That's Aesop's fables.     

12:26.612 --> 12:27.845
    The Good Book says          

12:27.847 --> 12:29.680
          that charity          
    begins and ends at home.    

12:29.682 --> 12:31.915
    Look at him there.          
      He's eating so fast,      

12:31.917 --> 12:33.217
            sparks are flying   

12:33.219 --> 12:35.219
                 out of his     
                 knife and fork.

12:35.221 --> 12:36.620
I'll eat                        
in the kitchen!                 

12:36.622 --> 12:37.921
                You could eat   
                on the porch.   

12:37.923 --> 12:39.724
             It's still the food
             I paid for, buddy! 

12:39.726 --> 12:41.826
              Oh, Archie, don't 
              talk to him like--

12:41.828 --> 12:43.227
  And you, my wife,             
  cooking for him!              

12:43.229 --> 12:44.228
                I don't mind.   

12:44.230 --> 12:45.463
  That's going                  
  to stop now,                  

12:45.465 --> 12:46.630
  until he starts               

12:46.632 --> 12:47.832
  chipping in                   
  for something.                

12:47.834 --> 12:48.966
Well,                           

12:48.968 --> 12:51.168
if that's the way               
you want it, okay.              

12:51.170 --> 12:53.103
          I'm working,          
so I'll pay for the food,       

12:53.105 --> 12:54.938
        and what's more,        
    I'll cook for him!          

12:54.940 --> 12:56.440
  I can, you know. I can cook!  

12:56.442 --> 12:58.743
         This is your father    
         you're talking to here.

12:58.745 --> 13:00.478
And in case you're              
worried about tonight,          

13:00.480 --> 13:03.347
 anything we eat, I'll pay for! 

13:10.856 --> 13:12.155
You hear                        
your daughter,                  

13:12.157 --> 13:13.657
turning on her father           
that way?                       

13:13.659 --> 13:14.759
22 years,                       

13:14.761 --> 13:16.861
I never heard her               
open her yap like that!         

13:16.863 --> 13:18.128
                  But she's just
                  sticking up   

13:18.130 --> 13:19.363
                for her husband.

13:19.365 --> 13:20.330
            [GROWLS]            

13:22.868 --> 13:24.568
             For the life of me,

13:24.570 --> 13:27.004
            I'll never          
            understand women.   

13:27.006 --> 13:29.273
              The way they marry
              some guy who goes 

13:29.275 --> 13:31.208
                and makes a damn
                fool of himself,

13:31.210 --> 13:33.143
                  but still,    
                  they love him.

13:35.280 --> 13:38.115
That's right, Archie.           

13:55.199 --> 13:56.734
Oh, hi, Gloria.                 

13:56.736 --> 13:58.535
How was your day?               

13:58.537 --> 13:59.970
            I don't have time   
            to talk, Ma.        

13:59.972 --> 14:01.571
            I got to start      
            Michael's dinner.   

14:01.573 --> 14:05.275
 Oh, dear, I wish we could all  
  get back to eating together,  

14:05.277 --> 14:06.844
         the same food          

14:06.846 --> 14:09.847
        in the same room        
    at the same time.           

14:09.849 --> 14:11.348
                Talk to Daddy   
                about that.     

14:11.350 --> 14:12.816
 Well, I tried to this morning, 

14:12.818 --> 14:14.518
    but he's still mad.         

14:14.520 --> 14:17.587
Why are you home                
so late, Gloria?                

14:17.589 --> 14:19.523
 Well, I stopped by the school  
            to vote             

14:19.525 --> 14:20.924
and so did everybody else.      

14:20.926 --> 14:22.592
You should have seen that line. 

14:22.594 --> 14:26.764
    Ma, what's your laundry     
doing in the refrigerator?      

14:26.766 --> 14:28.098
      I'm keeping it damp,      

14:28.100 --> 14:30.968
because I'm gonna iron it       
      right after dinner.       

14:30.970 --> 14:32.136
                     Ma, please,

14:32.138 --> 14:33.937
             I can't get through
             to my vegetables.  

14:33.939 --> 14:35.572
All right, Gloria.              

14:35.574 --> 14:38.375
You don't have                  
to get so upset!                

14:38.377 --> 14:41.244
After all,                      
I'm just as worked up           

14:41.246 --> 14:43.047
about the last                  
couple of weeks                 

14:43.049 --> 14:44.715
            as you.             

14:44.717 --> 14:47.517
      Why didn't you vote       
         this morning?          

14:47.519 --> 14:50.320
      Your store gave you       
         the time off.          

14:50.322 --> 14:52.622
        Because I wanted        
to spend some time with Michael.

14:52.624 --> 14:54.624
    I never see him anymore     
      except dinner time.       

14:54.626 --> 14:57.127
    Well, why does he           
 have to run off to the library 

14:57.129 --> 14:58.528
          every night?          

14:58.530 --> 15:00.297
  Why can't he study at home?   

15:00.299 --> 15:03.000
              Because he needs  
              special books, Ma.

15:03.002 --> 15:04.802
          Ma, where's my tomato?

15:04.804 --> 15:06.469
What?                           

15:06.471 --> 15:08.538
              I bought two      
              tomatoes yesterday

15:08.540 --> 15:10.240
                  and I used one
                  last night,   

15:10.242 --> 15:12.475
            and I was saving one
            for tonight.        

15:12.477 --> 15:14.477
Oh, I'm sorry,                  
Gloria.                         

15:14.479 --> 15:17.748
I must have put it              
in Archie's stew.               

15:17.750 --> 15:20.250
            Ma, how could you   
            do that?            

15:20.252 --> 15:21.651
                    I was saving
                    that tomato 

15:21.653 --> 15:23.087
            special for Michael.

15:23.089 --> 15:25.789
I said I was sorry,             
Gloria.                         

15:25.791 --> 15:28.792
It looked like                  
a regular tomato.               

15:31.295 --> 15:34.664
Didn't have no name             
on it or nothing.               

15:35.533 --> 15:38.135

15:42.041 --> 15:45.508
         Look at them.          
      They're all burned.       

15:45.510 --> 15:49.012
How did the oven get up to 500? 

15:49.014 --> 15:50.147
                 I did that, Ma.

15:50.149 --> 15:52.216
          I was getting it ready
          for my hamburgers.    

15:52.218 --> 15:53.450
Well, didn't you                
see my rolls?                   

15:56.020 --> 15:58.789
Sorry, Ma, I didn't look.       
I was in too much of a hurry.   

15:58.791 --> 15:59.957
              Excuse me, please.

16:08.333 --> 16:10.567
the rolls                       
are the best part               

16:10.569 --> 16:12.569
of the stew.                    

16:12.571 --> 16:13.904
                        What?   

16:13.906 --> 16:15.806
Well, how do you                
expect him                      

16:15.808 --> 16:20.177
to sop up the gravy?            

16:20.179 --> 16:22.345
            Well, what do you   
            want me to do?      

16:22.347 --> 16:23.847
Oh, I don't know.               

16:23.849 --> 16:25.415
            Here, Ma, use one   
            of our buns.        

16:25.417 --> 16:26.950
Well, that                      
won't do no good.               

16:26.952 --> 16:30.320
That's                          
a hamburger bun.                

16:30.322 --> 16:31.588
With stew,                      

16:31.590 --> 16:34.825
Archie has to have              
his Parker House.               

16:34.827 --> 16:37.227
      What do you want me to do?
I don't know!                   

16:37.229 --> 16:40.964
All I know is, you ruined       
your father's dinner!           

16:45.536 --> 16:48.538
             I said I was sorry!

16:48.540 --> 16:50.207
     Excuse me for living!      

16:50.209 --> 16:52.542
  What is all                   
  the hollering out here?       

16:52.544 --> 16:54.544
                        Nothing!

16:54.546 --> 16:55.913
     For a minute I thought     

16:55.915 --> 16:58.581
     I was in the back room     
     of a Greek restaurant.     

17:00.651 --> 17:01.852
  What's the matter with you?   

17:01.854 --> 17:03.053
Can't you act                   
refined?                        

17:03.055 --> 17:04.253
            Daddy, doesn't it   
            bother you          

17:04.256 --> 17:05.989
              to come home      
              and find Ma and me

17:05.991 --> 17:07.223
        practically at          
        each other's throats?   

17:07.226 --> 17:09.026
                 Don't you care?
Sure I do.                      

17:09.028 --> 17:11.094
I told youse                    
to shut up, didn't I?           

17:12.163 --> 17:13.730
It's all your fault,            
Daddy,                          

17:13.732 --> 17:15.299
that we're both                 
in that kitchen                 

17:15.300 --> 17:16.700
cooking two                     
separate meals,                 

17:16.702 --> 17:18.702
running into one another,       
getting on each other's nerves. 

17:18.704 --> 17:20.502
  That's your husband's fault.  
        You talk to him.        

17:20.505 --> 17:21.704
        He come into $200, here.

17:21.707 --> 17:23.573
        He had the chance       
        to do the right thing   

17:23.575 --> 17:25.843
     for this here family, but  
     what the hell does he care?

17:25.845 --> 17:28.045
Well, what the hell             
do you expect him to do?        

17:28.047 --> 17:30.080
              How dare you curse
              in this house?    

17:32.650 --> 17:34.784
You're not the only father      
who ever helped his kid.        

17:34.786 --> 17:36.553
      The meathead ain't my kid!

17:36.555 --> 17:38.188
And don't you call              
him "Meathead."                 

17:38.190 --> 17:39.356
He is my husband                

17:39.358 --> 17:41.158
and when you help him,          
you help me.                    

17:41.160 --> 17:42.759
Look, Daddy,                    
didn't your father              

17:42.761 --> 17:44.294
ever make sacrifices            
for you?                        

17:44.296 --> 17:45.329
                      No!       

17:45.331 --> 17:47.630
Well, wouldn't you              
have liked him to?              

17:47.632 --> 17:49.132
I mean,                         
all fathers do that.            

17:49.134 --> 17:51.201
That's what a family's          
all about.                      

17:51.203 --> 17:52.802
      Don't tell me             
      what a family's all about.

17:52.804 --> 17:54.738
Look, Daddy,                    
we made a deal.                 

17:54.740 --> 17:56.006
You're giving us                
room and board                  

17:56.008 --> 17:57.540
and we take care                
of everything else.             

17:57.542 --> 17:58.976
We take care                    
of clothes and movies           

17:58.978 --> 18:00.377
and Michael's books,            
everything!                     

18:00.379 --> 18:03.213
That was the deal!              
     What's my end of that deal?

18:03.215 --> 18:05.615
We're gonna pay you back        
every penny, with interest,     

18:05.617 --> 18:07.584
as soon as Michael              
finishes school                 

18:07.586 --> 18:09.552
and starts working.             
Case closed!                    

18:09.554 --> 18:11.721
                 Wait a minute--
Case closed!                    

18:11.723 --> 18:13.023
                      All right.

18:13.025 --> 18:14.191
                    Case closed!

18:14.193 --> 18:16.360
Except for                      
one more thing.                 

18:16.362 --> 18:17.494
You've got                      
the satisfaction                

18:17.496 --> 18:19.096
of knowing that you're          
helping your child              

18:19.098 --> 18:20.397
be better off                   
than you.                       

18:20.399 --> 18:22.532
Every father wants his kid      
to be better than him.          

18:22.534 --> 18:24.368
          That don't always work
          that way, little girl.

18:24.370 --> 18:26.103
        You look at the world   
        around you, there.      

18:26.105 --> 18:27.504
         Take a look            
         at your animal kingdom,

18:27.506 --> 18:28.538
             for example, there.

18:28.540 --> 18:29.940
      I mean, take your gorilla.

18:29.942 --> 18:32.442
    Your gorilla wants his kid  
 to grow up better than him too,

18:32.444 --> 18:33.643
            but the kid grows up

18:33.645 --> 18:35.245
                and there he is,
                still a gorilla.

18:35.247 --> 18:36.113
What?                           

18:40.151 --> 18:41.151
             Hello.             

18:41.153 --> 18:42.552
        Speaking of which.      

18:44.655 --> 18:45.855
  Hi, Michael, honey.           
                             Hi.

18:45.857 --> 18:47.457
Did you vote?                   
                    Oh, yeah.   

18:47.459 --> 18:48.792
                You should have 
                seen the turnout

18:48.794 --> 18:50.127
                at the polls.   
                It was great.   

18:50.129 --> 18:51.528
             Yeah,              
  it's the first time in weeks  

18:51.530 --> 18:53.897
 you're home at a decent hour,  
        there, Meathead.        

18:53.899 --> 18:55.999
        Ain't you going         
    to the library tonight?     

18:56.001 --> 18:58.368
It's Election Day, Daddy.       
     The library's closed.      

18:58.370 --> 18:59.536
Aw, gee,                        

18:59.538 --> 19:01.004
        that's too bad.         

19:01.006 --> 19:03.340
  It's always more pleasanter   
          around here           

19:03.342 --> 19:04.874
when the library is open.       

19:04.876 --> 19:06.810
 If you want to argue tonight,  
             Daddy,             

19:06.812 --> 19:08.211
you argue                       
with yourself.                  

19:08.213 --> 19:09.212
Come on, Michael.               

19:09.214 --> 19:10.213
EDITH:                          
Dinner.                         

19:10.215 --> 19:11.214
            Gloria,             

19:11.216 --> 19:12.215
                your dinner's   
                ready too.      

19:12.217 --> 19:13.383
                    Hi, Mike.   
Hi, Ma.                         

19:13.385 --> 19:15.218
Gee, that stew                  
smells great.                   

19:15.220 --> 19:17.154
            Yeah, well, you just
            smell it, Meathead, 

19:17.156 --> 19:18.488
                    and head for
                    the kitchen.

19:18.490 --> 19:19.656
                     Your grub's
                     out there. 

19:19.658 --> 19:20.690
Come on, Michael.               
Dinner.                         

19:20.692 --> 19:21.992
I'm coming.                     

19:21.994 --> 19:23.293
    Michael, how much longer    

19:23.295 --> 19:24.861
                do I have to    
                cover for you   

19:24.863 --> 19:26.096
    with that library story?    

19:26.098 --> 19:27.831
Please, can't we tell them      
you're working?                 

19:27.833 --> 19:28.832
      No, not yet, Gloria.      

19:28.834 --> 19:30.067
    I don't want to tell him    

19:30.069 --> 19:32.069
until I make back the $200      
      I gave to McGovern.       

19:32.071 --> 19:33.837
         Well, how much         
      have you got so far?      

19:33.839 --> 19:34.938
                            150.

19:34.940 --> 19:36.440
Oh, is that all?                

19:36.442 --> 19:38.375
         Well, Gloria,          
 it'll only take another week.  

19:38.377 --> 19:40.243
    What's for dinner?          

19:40.245 --> 19:43.280
Hamburgers.                     

19:43.282 --> 19:45.282
                          Again?

19:45.284 --> 19:47.317
I thought                       
you like hamburgers.            

19:47.319 --> 19:49.486
        I do, but not every day.

19:49.488 --> 19:50.587
Every other day.                

19:50.589 --> 19:52.789
Last night, I made you meatloaf.

19:54.825 --> 19:56.493
  Gloria, hamburger is meatloaf.

19:56.495 --> 19:58.795
          It's the same thing   
          with a different name.

19:58.797 --> 20:00.464
                 Can't you make 
                 something else?

20:00.466 --> 20:02.332
Michael, I work hard all day    

20:02.334 --> 20:04.067
and then rush                   
around this kitchen like crazy  

20:04.069 --> 20:06.370
to make your dinner,            
and all you do is complain.     

20:06.372 --> 20:08.972
      You can thank your stupid,
      pigheaded father for that.

20:08.974 --> 20:11.008
Hold it. Don't you              
call my father names            

20:11.010 --> 20:13.010
just because you had            
a fight with him.               

20:13.012 --> 20:15.645
That's not being fair,          
and maybe we're not being fair. 

20:15.647 --> 20:18.248
Maybe we should look at things  
from his point of view.         

20:18.250 --> 20:20.750
    That would be impossible,   
                Gloria.         

20:20.752 --> 20:23.586
              We'd have to close
            our minds first.    

20:23.588 --> 20:25.522
Michael, there are two sides    
to everything.                  

20:25.524 --> 20:26.623
Remember, it's not only         

20:26.625 --> 20:28.291
that you didn't                 
give Daddy the money,           

20:28.293 --> 20:30.494
but you gave it to somebody     
he's dead against.              

20:30.496 --> 20:33.497
             Gloria, whose side

      in the paper today?

22:10.095 --> 22:11.261
                  Yeah, well,   

22:11.263 --> 22:12.695
        maybe she won't be      
        smiling tomorrow.       

22:12.697 --> 22:14.097
Yes, she will, buddy boy,       

22:14.099 --> 22:16.466

    tomorrow morning,
