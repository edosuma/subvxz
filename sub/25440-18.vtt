00:53.078 --> 00:55.560
Mr. Matthews,
what is this place?

00:55.648 --> 00:59.208
It's called "The House
of Yesterday's Tomorrow."

00:59.296 --> 01:03.289
The good news is you are welcome
to stay as long as you like.

01:03.377 --> 01:04.531
Something's not right.

01:04.619 --> 01:06.967
Why is this huge place just sitting
here in the middle of nowhere?

01:07.054 --> 01:09.388
<i>And that guy, or innkeeper,
or whatever he is,</i>

01:09.476 --> 01:12.625
<i>just takes us in, offers us food
and a place to stay for the night</i>

01:12.712 --> 01:14.396

for a single coin?</i>

01:14.484 --> 01:16.367
<i>Look, Cass,
I know this is weird,</i>

01:16.455 --> 01:20.593

01:35.859 --> 01:37.296
Mm...

01:37.484 --> 01:40.252
Good morning, Pascal!

01:47.082 --> 01:49.642
You know, aside from the
fact that we were nearly replaced

01:49.729 --> 01:51.345
by evil doppelgangers
last night,

01:51.433 --> 01:54.963
the House of Yesterday's Tomorrow
offers a pretty good night's sleep!

01:55.051 --> 01:56.758
Well, it's certainly
the coziest

01:56.846 --> 01:58.641
seashell-shaped inn
I've ever slept in.

01:58.729 --> 02:00.541
I've stayed
at a cozier one.

02:00.629 --> 02:03.610
No, wait... that was a
seashell shaped like an inn.

02:03.698 --> 02:05.711
- Five stars.
- Uh, wait a minute...

02:05.778 --> 02:08.526
- ...the door.
- It was right here yesterday!

02:08.633 --> 02:10.627
Now, everyone relax!

02:10.715 --> 02:13.268
There's a solution
to every problem.

02:20.330 --> 02:24.681
It's no use! We're trapped!
It's all over!

02:24.806 --> 02:26.971
Okay...
what's for breakfast?

02:28.018 --> 02:29.038
Come on, guys!

02:29.126 --> 02:30.931
There's gotta be
another way out of here.

02:32.839 --> 02:34.687
Except in this case.

02:37.158 --> 02:38.338
Whoa!

02:38.495 --> 02:39.736
Cass!

02:41.759 --> 02:43.126
That's not an exit.

02:54.347 --> 02:56.357
Dog, dog, dog, dog!

02:56.445 --> 02:58.875
A dog kennel.
And why not, right?

02:58.963 --> 03:01.475
Well, at least we can take
that door off the list.

03:01.563 --> 03:04.045
Hey! I found
the way out!

03:10.670 --> 03:12.278
Whoa!

03:22.241 --> 03:24.641
Shorty,
this isn't a way out!

03:24.729 --> 03:27.336
Well, not with
that attitude, it's not.

03:27.424 --> 03:30.596
Well, look, the adults
would like to find a...

03:32.585 --> 03:34.200
Oh, great.

03:35.973 --> 03:37.640
Hello!

03:38.224 --> 03:41.929
My name is
Eugene Fitzher...

03:42.132 --> 03:44.443
bear... rawr.

03:44.530 --> 03:47.490
Wow, yeah, your teddy bear
voice could use some work.

03:47.578 --> 03:50.161
Not to mention your
pun skills, Blondie.

03:50.249 --> 03:52.952
Okay, fine, fine.
But isn't this crazy?!

03:53.132 --> 03:56.188
Whoever all this belongs
to is one lucky kid.

03:56.275 --> 03:57.790
One lucky
spoiled kid.

03:57.878 --> 03:59.825
Oh, Eugene,
there's nothing wrong

03:59.913 --> 04:01.497
with indulging a kid
every now and then.

04:01.585 --> 04:03.482
Ah, ah, ah, now that's
a slippery slope.

04:03.570 --> 04:05.030
Kids need
boundaries.

04:05.117 --> 04:06.298
You gotta let them
know who's boss.

04:06.385 --> 04:09.546
Ooh! Got
to let dem know who boss!

04:09.634 --> 04:11.249
Grrr!

04:11.390 --> 04:12.804
And he's gone.

04:13.125 --> 04:15.913
Okay, playtime's over.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.683
Aw, come on, Cass!
Lighten up.

04:17.795 --> 04:19.622
When do we ever get
the chance to play

04:19.709 --> 04:21.247
with amazing toy
swords like this?

04:21.334 --> 04:24.398
You do realize we have
actual swords., right?

04:24.492 --> 04:26.704
Yeah, but, uh, since
these are just toys...

04:28.741 --> 04:29.795
they don't hurt.

04:30.092 --> 04:31.190
Yee-aw!

04:31.941 --> 04:33.025
Sure about that?

04:33.112 --> 04:34.560
Okay,
sword time's over.

04:40.853 --> 04:42.835
Now, come on,
enough messing around.

04:42.922 --> 04:44.570
We've gotta find an
exit...

04:44.857 --> 04:46.872
No way!

04:46.959 --> 04:48.841
I used to have a top
just like this!

04:48.928 --> 04:50.378
I love these things!

04:50.466 --> 04:53.816
Uh, Cassandra...
you like tops?

04:54.033 --> 04:56.957
- Got a problem with that?
- No, by all means. Spin away.

04:59.940 --> 05:01.353
Look at it go!

05:02.675 --> 05:04.635
Does this seem weird
to anybody else?

05:04.723 --> 05:09.847
Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa! Whoa!

05:10.556 --> 05:13.012
Well, we'd better keep
looking for a way out of here.

05:25.898 --> 05:27.212
Are those...

05:27.299 --> 05:30.282
...our friends?

05:30.369 --> 05:31.784
You can't catch me!

05:38.646 --> 05:39.960
Ehh...

05:41.100 --> 05:42.271
Ah!

05:45.723 --> 05:48.100
Tag! You're it,
Fitzherjerk!

05:48.187 --> 05:49.301
Yep,
definitely them.

05:50.825 --> 05:53.801
Best. Playtime. Ever!

05:59.083 --> 06:02.314
Okay, okay, something in this house
has turned you all into children.

06:02.401 --> 06:04.034
So if we're going
to turn you back,

06:04.122 --> 06:05.184
we're gonna need
answers.

06:05.271 --> 06:06.629
Na-na-na.

06:06.717 --> 06:09.487
- Hey, you wanna play chase?
- What?!

06:09.575 --> 06:10.622
Play chase? No!

06:10.709 --> 06:11.810
We need to know
what happened!

06:11.897 --> 06:13.024
So... speak up.

06:13.112 --> 06:16.295
Uh, Eugene, maybe you'd
better let me talk to them.

06:18.951 --> 06:21.166
Hi, Lance,

06:21.253 --> 06:24.670
so, I see you're making
something very... tall.

06:24.757 --> 06:26.372
Doesn't that
look fun?

06:26.459 --> 06:28.791
Mm-mm.

06:31.159 --> 06:32.978
So, Lance, sweetheart,

06:33.065 --> 06:35.381
uh, can you tell us
how all this happened?

06:35.468 --> 06:36.789
How what happened?

06:36.877 --> 06:39.351
How you were turned into kids.

06:39.438 --> 06:40.877
Who turned to kids?

06:41.983 --> 06:44.823
How you were
turned into kids...

06:46.078 --> 06:48.221
Why do you have
a bird in your hair?

06:48.309 --> 06:51.229
- Oh, well, because I like birds...
- What kind of birds are they?

06:51.317 --> 06:54.672
Well, um, it's not really
any kind of bird,

06:54.760 --> 06:56.402
it's more of
a simple design.

06:56.489 --> 06:57.669
Why's your hair
so long?

06:57.756 --> 07:00.010
I bet it's because you're
really, really, old.

07:00.098 --> 07:02.340
Well, no,
actually, it's...

07:02.428 --> 07:03.409
Where do clouds
go at night?

07:03.496 --> 07:04.342
What's your
favorite song?

07:04.430 --> 07:06.285
What sound would zero make
if it wasn't a number?

07:06.373 --> 07:07.394
What's for dinner?

07:08.934 --> 07:11.383
Cass, you need to come
down from there right now,

07:11.470 --> 07:12.909
and tell me
what's going on.

07:12.997 --> 07:14.211
Sure.

07:14.299 --> 07:16.563
I've been wanting to tell
you something, anyway.

07:21.110 --> 07:22.867
Ear flick!

07:23.367 --> 07:25.703
Well, it's nice to see
that young Cassandra

07:25.791 --> 07:28.213
is even more pleasant
than Cassandra Classic.

07:29.655 --> 07:31.236
Why don't crabs
have eyebrows?

07:31.323 --> 07:32.871
Because they have
an exoskeleton.

07:32.958 --> 07:34.258
Do I have
an exoskeleton?

07:34.346 --> 07:36.127
No, you have
an endoskeleton.

07:36.215 --> 07:38.455
- Do fishes have a nose?
- They do not

07:38.543 --> 07:41.149
have noses, but they
do have nostrils.

07:41.237 --> 07:44.016
Now, can I ask you
a few questions...

07:44.103 --> 07:45.502
Woo-hoo!

07:46.478 --> 07:47.578
Hey!

07:47.674 --> 07:49.688
Cassandra,
that's not nice.

07:49.775 --> 07:51.672
What do you have
to say for yourself?

07:51.760 --> 07:56.295
I have to say I love the "boom"
sound it made.

07:56.382 --> 07:58.797
Ten out of ten.

07:58.884 --> 08:00.599
Hey!
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

08:00.686 --> 08:02.072
Kids, kids, kids,
kids, kids!

08:02.160 --> 08:04.010
The princess
is not a maypole!

08:14.981 --> 08:16.829
Ooh, a lizard!

08:16.917 --> 08:18.992
Oh! I wanna hold him!
I wanna hold him!

08:30.482 --> 08:32.431
Okay Lance!
Be careful!

08:32.518 --> 08:33.696
He's not
a squishy toy!

08:33.784 --> 08:36.001
Lance always loved
animals as a kid.

08:44.235 --> 08:46.445
A lizard...

08:48.346 --> 08:50.648
You're so cute,
I wanna squish your face!

08:50.736 --> 08:53.652
I wanna squish your belly and
your weird little lizard eyeballs!

08:53.739 --> 08:56.455
You're a little green baby,
who's a little green baby?

08:56.542 --> 08:58.357
Who's a fancy
little green baby?

08:58.444 --> 08:59.944
Yes you are,
yes you are!

09:00.032 --> 09:01.086
Little baby?

09:01.174 --> 09:03.569
Oh, wait, wait,
where is baby Shorty?

09:08.218 --> 09:09.687
No!

09:10.183 --> 09:11.331
Fancy this?

09:11.640 --> 09:15.079
I see someone has got
into the nursery!

09:15.198 --> 09:17.509
Ahh. The Ol' Top
of Time.

09:17.596 --> 09:20.126
Ohh, look at
the baby!

09:20.217 --> 09:24.095
<i>Zut alor,</i> that is
one ugly baby,<i> oui?</i>

09:24.212 --> 09:27.386
Now, now, now, now,
would you look at this mess?

09:27.473 --> 09:28.499
- He did it!
- She did it!

09:28.587 --> 09:30.126
- He's lying!
- She's lying!

09:31.268 --> 09:33.985
The older you are,
the younger it makes you.

09:34.502 --> 09:36.322
This one must've been ancient.

09:36.749 --> 09:38.663
Matthews, how do we
turn our friends back,

09:38.751 --> 09:39.789
and get out
of this place?!

09:39.876 --> 09:41.147
We want answers!

09:41.235 --> 09:43.923
Well, is that what you want,
or what you need?

09:44.011 --> 09:45.059
Stop that.

09:45.147 --> 09:47.944
In many cases, they are
two very separate things.

09:48.032 --> 09:48.866
Stop that.

09:48.954 --> 09:50.409
However, in this case,

09:50.496 --> 09:52.477
it's most likely
the same thing.

09:52.564 --> 09:54.243
Will you stop that?!

09:54.331 --> 09:55.897
You have the mustache
of your own!

09:55.985 --> 09:57.216
Mr. Matthews,
please.

09:57.303 --> 10:00.385
Do you have any idea how
to change our friends back?

10:00.472 --> 10:02.813
Surely,
it's a cinch.

10:02.955 --> 10:05.938
Simply find that top,
and spin it in reverse.

10:06.245 --> 10:08.527
Okay... that seems...
easy enough.

10:08.614 --> 10:12.025
Of course, you only
have one hour to do so,

10:12.113 --> 10:14.733
or they'll remain
kids forever.

10:14.956 --> 10:18.009
And why is it that there's only just
one hour to reverse these things?!

10:18.097 --> 10:20.011
Or, you could leave
things as they are.

10:20.099 --> 10:21.579
You know what
they say,

10:21.660 --> 10:25.510
you know, "To be young
again is... good."

10:25.597 --> 10:28.046
It's a poor saying, what
do you want from me, <i>ou </i> I?

10:28.133 --> 10:29.581
I'll leave you
to it, then.

10:29.668 --> 10:31.079
Now, now, now,
don't forget...

10:31.167 --> 10:33.228
We know! One hour
to corral these kids

10:33.316 --> 10:35.094
back in that nursery or
they'll be like this forever.

10:35.181 --> 10:37.884
No. I was just
going to say:

10:37.972 --> 10:39.758
somebody
went poopsies.

10:42.276 --> 10:44.002
You know, it kills
me to agree with him,

10:44.089 --> 10:45.025
but you are
an ugly baby.

10:45.113 --> 10:47.599
Alright, let's get
back to that nursery...

10:47.686 --> 10:48.691
Kids?

10:48.779 --> 10:51.581
Ugh. No!
Hey, get back here!

10:58.067 --> 11:01.250
Now, Lance, Cass, even
though you're children,

11:01.400 --> 11:02.869
your voices matter.

11:02.975 --> 11:05.119
This is
a discussion.

11:05.237 --> 11:08.463
So, whoever holds this gravy
boat gets to talk, okay?

11:08.551 --> 11:11.002
- Ugh! This is...
- Oop, wait wait wait, wait wait...

11:11.143 --> 11:12.924
I have the gravy boat.

11:13.011 --> 11:16.416
Eugene and I only want to help
turn you back to normal, but...

11:16.504 --> 11:19.377
we can't do that
if you keep running off.

11:19.551 --> 11:21.494
So, I think
from now on,

11:21.582 --> 11:22.830
we should stay
together...

11:22.918 --> 11:25.433
Alone we are strong,

11:25.547 --> 11:29.096
together we are stronger.

11:36.769 --> 11:39.251
Okay, okay.
Ha-ha-ha very funny,

11:39.338 --> 11:40.485
now it's time to...

11:40.572 --> 11:41.953
My gravy boat!

11:42.040 --> 11:44.156
Can't talk without
the gravy boat!

11:44.507 --> 11:46.314
Lance, over here!

11:48.614 --> 11:49.994
Okay, guys...

11:50.082 --> 11:52.187
we've only got
30 minutes left...

11:52.275 --> 11:54.599
Blondie, look, if we're
gonna get this done,

11:54.686 --> 11:57.169
we really should think
about being more firm.

11:57.256 --> 11:59.604
Trust me, kids
respond to authority.

11:59.691 --> 12:01.807
Uh, trust me,
Eugene.

12:01.894 --> 12:04.676
Kids respond best when they
feel like they're being heard.

12:04.763 --> 12:06.812
Give them the freedom
to express themselves

12:06.899 --> 12:08.447
without talking
down to them,

12:08.534 --> 12:10.115
and they might
just surprise you.

12:16.548 --> 12:18.521
Alright,
you listen up!

12:18.609 --> 12:20.190
Here's the plan, kids:

12:20.278 --> 12:21.588
we are all going to
go into the nursery,

12:21.676 --> 12:23.528
find that top and turn
you back to normal.

12:23.615 --> 12:24.863
We will not be
running off.

12:24.950 --> 12:26.466
We will not be
breaking things.

12:26.568 --> 12:28.567
And for the love of all
things big and small,

12:28.654 --> 12:30.802
we will leave
that poor frog alone.

12:33.515 --> 12:34.539
Is that clear?

12:34.626 --> 12:35.917
Are there any questions?

12:36.005 --> 12:37.242
Can I go to the bathroom?

12:37.404 --> 12:39.552
Again?!
Can't it wait?

12:39.640 --> 12:42.179
C'mon, Eugene,
he's just a kid.

12:42.267 --> 12:43.108
Fine.

12:43.196 --> 12:44.516
I'll take Lance
to the bathroom.

12:44.603 --> 12:46.483
Raps, you take
the others to the nursery.

12:46.571 --> 12:47.421
We'll be there
in five.

12:47.509 --> 12:48.428
Let's go, Lancey!

12:48.516 --> 12:50.088
You don't wanna
be a kid forever.

12:50.175 --> 12:51.226
One-two, one-two.

12:51.314 --> 12:52.226
Y'know, Cass?

12:52.314 --> 12:54.384
Eugene shouldn't be so rigid
with Lance.

12:54.472 --> 12:57.455
That's why I'm glad we approached
our relationship with a...

12:57.652 --> 13:00.868
mutual respect,
and built a solid rapport...

13:00.963 --> 13:02.245
And she's missing.

13:02.333 --> 13:04.036
Okay then, alright.

13:07.159 --> 13:08.273
Now, do you
wanna play chase?

13:08.360 --> 13:10.075
No, I don't want
to play chase.

13:10.162 --> 13:11.676
I thought you had to
go to the bathroom.

13:11.763 --> 13:13.578
- What's that?
- That's a sculpture.

13:13.665 --> 13:15.046
- What's it do?
- It doesn't do anything.

13:15.133 --> 13:16.615
It's art. It's for
people to look at.

13:16.702 --> 13:18.083
- What people?
- Just people.

13:18.170 --> 13:19.684
Now, quit dillydallying.

13:19.771 --> 13:22.454
- Can I have a piggy back ride?
- For the fourth time, no.

13:22.541 --> 13:24.523
- What's that?
- That's another sculpture.

13:24.610 --> 13:27.360
- What does it do?
- It does the same... ugh!

13:27.509 --> 13:30.061
Look, can we please stop with
all these pointless questions?!

13:30.148 --> 13:31.563
Because you are
killin' me here!

13:31.650 --> 13:33.465
Oh, no no no no.

13:33.552 --> 13:36.030
No, no, please don't cry!
Please don't cry!

13:36.118 --> 13:37.397
I hate seeing kids cry.

13:37.485 --> 13:40.064
It's gonna make me cry, and I
have a really ugly crying face.

13:40.152 --> 13:42.343
Hey, how about
that piggyback ride?

13:42.431 --> 13:43.976
Yay! Giddy up, giddy up!

13:44.064 --> 13:45.288
Giddy up, giddy up!

13:46.798 --> 13:49.414
- What's that?
- It's... another... sculpture.

13:49.501 --> 13:50.701
What's it do?

13:51.340 --> 13:53.787
Cass? Where are you?

13:54.806 --> 13:56.455
Oh, sh-sh-sh-sh.

13:56.542 --> 13:57.741
Woo-hoo!

14:01.213 --> 14:02.928
Okay, come on.

14:03.015 --> 14:04.563
We're running out of time.

14:04.650 --> 14:06.097
You can't touch
the floor!

14:06.184 --> 14:07.399
It's made of lava!

14:07.486 --> 14:08.767
You're burning!

14:08.854 --> 14:11.436
Cassandra, we only
have about 15 more...

14:11.523 --> 14:13.472
You're burning!

14:13.559 --> 14:15.006
Shh!

14:15.093 --> 14:18.677
Aww, I thought
my voice "mattered."

14:25.037 --> 14:27.986
Oh no, the baby's headed
straight for the lava lake!

14:28.073 --> 14:29.488
Oh, no!

14:29.575 --> 14:32.657
No, that's lava!

14:36.281 --> 14:38.014
Not bad, huh, Cass?

14:39.034 --> 14:40.549
Cass?

14:49.595 --> 14:50.876
Hey, Cass.

14:50.963 --> 14:52.844
I think the lava's
gone now.

14:52.931 --> 14:54.846
Yeah, you know what?
You're right...

14:54.933 --> 14:56.181
It's acid!

14:56.268 --> 14:59.184
Ughh...

14:59.271 --> 15:02.298
Yes... they
are a handful, aren't they?

15:02.386 --> 15:04.656
But, uh,
motherhood suits you.

15:04.743 --> 15:06.525
- What?!
- I'm just suggesting

15:06.612 --> 15:09.072
that should you fail
to acquire the top in time,

15:09.160 --> 15:12.175
it wouldn't be the worst
thing in the world.<i> N'est pa?</i>

15:12.417 --> 15:15.050
After all, you make
a darling family,

15:15.287 --> 15:18.036
and this place would
make quite the home...

15:18.123 --> 15:20.672
for a family,
don't you agree?

15:20.759 --> 15:23.174
Lance! Show
me some hustle!

15:23.261 --> 15:25.862
Mr. Matthews, I...

15:27.588 --> 15:29.642
Do not go jelly-legs
on me!

15:29.730 --> 15:30.882
You stand up right now!

15:30.969 --> 15:32.384
Blondie, why you
just hanging there?

15:32.471 --> 15:34.920
Oh, you know,
the floor is acid.

15:35.007 --> 15:36.421
Ahhh!

15:36.508 --> 15:38.523
- Acid, acid, acid!
- That's all I had to do?!

15:45.851 --> 15:47.584
Oh, look,
there's the top!

15:48.949 --> 15:50.553
Raawr!

15:53.859 --> 15:56.207
- My turn!
- No, you get to play with the wagon!

15:56.294 --> 15:58.743
Okay, okay, guys,
we only have, like,

15:58.830 --> 16:01.413
five minutes,
so maybe we might...

16:01.500 --> 16:04.601
Give me that top
right now, young lady!

16:06.438 --> 16:09.651
One... two...

16:09.739 --> 16:12.184
two and a half...
two and three quarters...

16:12.286 --> 16:13.318
Gimme that top!

16:13.406 --> 16:16.294
Eugene, yelling at them
won't get the top back!

16:16.411 --> 16:18.863
Oh, what should I do?
Cuddle it out of them?

16:18.950 --> 16:20.365
What's that
supposed to mean?

16:20.452 --> 16:22.801
It means you let these
kids walk all over you.

16:22.888 --> 16:26.204
And bossing them around seems
to have worked really well!

16:26.291 --> 16:28.773
Let's go someplace
a little less... them.

16:28.860 --> 16:30.976
Oh, hey, Lance
was doing just fine

16:31.063 --> 16:33.144
until he was back
under Cass's influence!

16:33.231 --> 16:35.624
Somehow I find that
hard to believe!

16:35.712 --> 16:36.531
You know what?

16:36.619 --> 16:38.041
Let's just spin
that top,

16:38.136 --> 16:39.551
and get out
of this place!

16:39.638 --> 16:42.988
- Fine!
- Fine.

16:43.075 --> 16:44.374
Tally-ho!

16:46.545 --> 16:49.661
Weeee!

17:10.335 --> 17:12.784
And this is why
I'm a cat person.

17:12.871 --> 17:14.786
You get Lance
and I'll get Cass!

17:14.873 --> 17:18.589
We gotta get that top
before the dogs wake up!

17:18.676 --> 17:20.425
Hey, Cass,

17:20.512 --> 17:22.926
sweetie, I know you
want to get the top,

17:23.013 --> 17:25.964
and I know you're very
brave, but you're in

17:26.050 --> 17:28.266
an unsafe situation
right now, so...

17:28.353 --> 17:31.057
I need you to please
exit the kennel.

17:31.295 --> 17:33.760
Uh-huh, you're not
the boss of me.

17:35.093 --> 17:37.842
No I-I-I'm not telling
you what to do.

17:37.929 --> 17:41.690
But, I am strongly
suggesting you reconsider...

17:41.834 --> 17:43.716
Wow, Eugene was right.

17:43.819 --> 17:46.081
You do let us walk
all over you.

17:46.182 --> 17:51.107
You guys are going to
be disasters as parents.

17:52.414 --> 17:53.657
Lancey-poo, come with me,

17:53.745 --> 17:55.860
- right now.
- Why this way?

17:55.947 --> 17:57.495
Because that's
the way to the door,

17:57.582 --> 17:59.631
- and we have to go bye-bye.
- Why?

18:03.221 --> 18:06.237
- Hey, what are you...
- Okay, listen up, young lady.

18:06.324 --> 18:07.906
Playtime is over!

18:08.087 --> 18:11.304
You get your rear-end outta
this kennel right now!

18:11.392 --> 18:12.977
And walk
on those tiptoes!

18:13.064 --> 18:16.981
But...
- No buts! Out! Tiptoes! Now!

18:17.068 --> 18:18.717
Yes, ma'am.

18:22.174 --> 18:24.322
Listen to me:
we have got to go!

18:24.409 --> 18:26.057
Why can't you just do
what you're told?

18:26.144 --> 18:29.166
Because... I'm a kid.

18:29.414 --> 18:34.775
And kids need to feel
like they're being heard.

18:35.020 --> 18:36.935
Okay, Lance,
what do you want to do?

18:37.022 --> 18:38.103
Huh, buddy?
I'm listening.

18:38.190 --> 18:40.905
I dunno.
Play chase?

18:40.992 --> 18:42.607
I was hoping
you'd say that.

18:42.694 --> 18:44.514
Tag! You're it!

18:44.631 --> 18:46.720
No, no, no, you're
supposed to chase me!

18:46.808 --> 18:49.247
Ge-ge-ge-ge,
ahh...

18:49.863 --> 18:52.183
Cass, Lance,
wait outside for us.

18:52.270 --> 18:53.355
That is an order!

18:57.918 --> 19:00.662
Easy... easy...

19:03.591 --> 19:04.763
Uh-oh.

19:04.850 --> 19:07.565
600 pounds of fur and
slobber headed our way!

19:20.332 --> 19:23.114
Here boys, here you want
a treat? Huh?

19:23.201 --> 19:25.068
Yeah, yeah, yeah
ya do! Go get it!

19:27.205 --> 19:28.987
Alright, well, you're
smarter than you look.

19:29.074 --> 19:30.922
And I apologize
for underestimating you.

19:46.925 --> 19:49.107
Baby Lance!
The door! The door!

19:49.194 --> 19:52.143
Uh... uhh...

19:52.230 --> 19:53.830
Why would you...
I meant go out the door!

19:55.200 --> 19:56.014
It's locked!

19:56.101 --> 19:58.067
- Why would you...?!
- I'm a kid.

20:13.351 --> 20:16.000
- Aww.
- Come here, come here.

20:23.261 --> 20:26.110
Okay, it was fun
babysitting for the day,

20:26.197 --> 20:29.013
but let's get you
guys back to normal.

20:29.100 --> 20:31.149
Time to add
about 16 years.

20:31.250 --> 20:34.786
Uh, well, in Shorty's
case, about 60 years?

20:34.873 --> 20:36.672
How old is Shorty exactly?

20:36.875 --> 20:39.357
45... 75...
I have no idea.

20:47.579 --> 20:49.895
Hey, I'm still missing
a couple teeth!

20:50.155 --> 20:52.337
You were always
missing a couple teeth.

20:55.460 --> 20:58.076
We can keep
the puppies, right?

21:02.634 --> 21:04.983
Still no way out.

21:05.070 --> 21:07.218
And it's gonna take us forever
to check this whole place.

21:07.305 --> 21:12.223
Ugh, well, I guess we'll just
have to stay here another night.

21:12.310 --> 21:14.404
Today was really tough...

21:14.679 --> 21:18.333
But you know, even though we
didn't always agree on everything,

21:18.421 --> 21:22.779
I think our differing approaches
ended up being complementary

21:22.921 --> 21:24.269
in a weird way.

21:25.285 --> 21:27.171
Blondie,
I completely agree.

21:27.258 --> 21:31.279
If we ever do decide to have
kids, assertiveness, compassion...

21:31.388 --> 21:33.111
And a whole lot of love.

21:33.198 --> 21:36.591
- Tag! You're it!
- You do not know who you're messing with!

21:36.848 --> 21:40.763
Hey, hey, hey,
no running in the house!

21:40.994 --> 21:43.120
Hey! Go easy on them.

21:45.643 --> 21:48.893
The mirror failed.

21:48.980 --> 21:50.929
The top failed.

21:51.646 --> 21:53.564
But I promise you, Master,

21:53.651 --> 21:57.911
I will keep the Sundrop
in this house.

21:58.378 --> 21:59.746
Forever.
