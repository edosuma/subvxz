THEME SONG: A promise that I
keep, I'll never share, I'll

00:53.363 --> 00:54.261
never speak.

00:54.295 --> 00:58.127
To my grave the secret goes.

00:58.161 --> 01:00.439
The beating heart, the
beating heart.

01:00.474 --> 01:02.786
Where mystic creatures
wandered far.

01:02.821 --> 01:06.652
Through these veins
a wolfblood flows.

01:06.687 --> 01:09.172
Through these veins

MADDY [OFFSCREEN]:
Thanks, Mom.

01:15.765 --> 01:17.732
-Yeah, next time you miss the
bus you can walk to school.

01:17.767 --> 01:20.494
-If I run, I'd get here
before the bus.

01:20.528 --> 01:22.427
-Don't forget to invite Rhydian
round for dinner.

01:22.461 --> 01:26.741
We need to talk to him about
transforming safely.

01:26.776 --> 01:29.123
-Just, let me talk
to him first.

01:29.158 --> 01:29.779
-No, Maddy.

01:29.813 --> 01:31.436
Invite him round.

01:31.470 --> 01:33.748
-Just promise me you
want embarrass him.

01:33.783 --> 01:34.749
-Of course not.

01:34.784 --> 01:36.303
I'm not entirely without tact.

01:39.789 --> 01:41.239
[horn honking]

01:41.273 --> 01:43.862
-Tell him Wednesday is
hog roast night.

01:58.256 --> 02:00.292
MADDY [THINKING] You idiot.

02:00.327 --> 02:01.673
-Mads, come check this out.

02:01.707 --> 02:03.157
Incredible, isn't it?

02:03.192 --> 02:05.849
Proof at last.

02:05.884 --> 02:07.506
-Yeah.

02:07.541 --> 02:09.612
-It's so scary.

02:09.645 --> 02:10.751
Where did you get it?

02:10.785 --> 02:12.270
-I took it myself,
this morning.

02:12.304 --> 02:13.547
-It's amazing.

02:13.581 --> 02:14.927
-Seriously, Shannon, we
always just thought

02:14.962 --> 02:16.757
you were a bit mental.

02:16.791 --> 02:17.689
-Thanks.

02:17.723 --> 02:18.414
-It looks a wolf.

02:18.448 --> 02:20.278
Were you scared?

02:20.312 --> 02:21.727
-Yeah.

02:21.762 --> 02:23.695
I've been up on the moors
searching for proof for years.

02:23.729 --> 02:26.801
JIMI [OFFSCREEN]: You
call this proof?

02:26.836 --> 02:28.562
-Yeah, I call it proof.

02:28.596 --> 02:30.357
What do you call it?

02:30.391 --> 02:31.220
-Photoshop.

02:31.254 --> 02:34.637
[snickering]

02:34.671 --> 02:37.640
-You can laugh all you like,
but I've got the cards from

02:37.674 --> 02:41.816
the camera in the darkroom with
the original raw files.

02:41.851 --> 02:43.439
You can't fake those.

02:43.473 --> 02:44.302
-Fine.

02:44.336 --> 02:45.475
Let's see it then.

03:17.369 --> 03:18.543
-It was right here.

03:18.577 --> 03:21.477
-Ooh, maybe the monster
took it.

03:21.511 --> 03:22.754
-Well, someone took it.

03:22.788 --> 03:23.962
-Oh, please don't tell me.

03:23.996 --> 03:25.239
It's all a conspiracy.

03:25.274 --> 03:25.895
-Shannon, leave it.

03:25.929 --> 03:26.827
He's not worth it.

03:26.861 --> 03:27.828
-You took it, didn't you?

03:27.862 --> 03:29.450
To make me look like an idiot.

03:29.485 --> 03:31.521
-You don't need any
help with that.

03:31.556 --> 03:33.661
[laughter]

03:33.696 --> 03:34.317
-No.

03:34.352 --> 03:35.076
It's real.

03:35.111 --> 03:36.423
I'll--I'll find the card.

03:36.457 --> 03:36.837
-Shannon, it's OK.

03:36.871 --> 03:37.734
-No.

03:37.769 --> 03:38.942
They believed me, Tom.

03:38.977 --> 03:40.323
No one has ever believed
me before.

03:40.358 --> 03:42.256
-We believe you, and
you know the truth.

03:42.291 --> 03:42.843
That's all that matters.

03:42.877 --> 03:44.258
-No.

03:44.293 --> 03:46.295
This is the closest that
I'd ever been, Maddy.

03:46.329 --> 03:47.917
And the proof is on that card.

03:55.959 --> 03:57.858
-I know you took it.

03:57.892 --> 03:58.721
-Yeah.

03:58.755 --> 04:00.550
You can thank me later.

04:00.585 --> 04:02.897
-You made Shannon look
like a total idiot.

04:02.932 --> 04:04.520
-Tough.

04:04.554 --> 04:05.728
-If you weren't wolfing out in
the woods, Shannon wouldn't

04:05.762 --> 04:07.454
have got a picture in
the first place.

04:07.488 --> 04:08.351
-It wasn't me.

04:08.386 --> 04:09.835
-Then who was it?

04:09.870 --> 04:12.769
-I'm always guilty until proven
innocent, aren't I?

04:12.804 --> 04:15.358
-A wolf pack hasn't
been sighted in

04:15.393 --> 04:16.773
Stoneybridge for years.

04:16.808 --> 04:19.500
You come along, and suddenly
Shannon's got a picture.

04:19.535 --> 04:20.605
Come on.

04:20.639 --> 04:21.640
-It couldn't be one
of your parents?

04:21.675 --> 04:23.401
-They don't wolf
out in public.

04:23.435 --> 04:25.610
You took that memory card
to cover your own back.

04:25.644 --> 04:27.094
-I took it to protect us.

04:27.128 --> 04:28.820
If you'd rather protect your
idiot friend's reputation,

04:28.854 --> 04:29.959
then go ahead.

04:32.479 --> 04:33.618
-You're an idiot.

04:36.586 --> 04:38.485
Oh, Shannon, you idiot.

04:41.729 --> 04:43.110
Are you OK?

04:43.144 --> 04:44.594
-Oh, yeah, I'm fine, apart from
the fact I'm a laughing

04:44.629 --> 04:45.699
stock.

04:45.733 --> 04:46.907
-Well, I mean, I'm
not surprised.

04:46.941 --> 04:49.323
Have you seen this
memory card?

04:49.358 --> 04:50.566
Really, Shannon?

04:50.600 --> 04:51.705
-And I've got to stand
detention tomorrow.

04:51.739 --> 04:53.327
-What for?

04:53.362 --> 04:55.812
Apparently photocopying 30
posters is misuse of school

04:55.847 --> 04:56.710
property.

04:56.744 --> 04:57.711
-Well, I'm not surprised.

04:57.745 --> 04:58.643
I mean, it is--

04:58.677 --> 04:59.713
-Plus I got one for fighting.

04:59.747 --> 05:01.646
-What?

05:01.680 --> 05:04.407
-I was frisking Liam, he
shoved me away and so I

05:04.442 --> 05:05.063
cracked him one.

05:05.097 --> 05:06.375
-Shannon?

05:06.409 --> 05:07.962
-I need to find that card.

05:07.997 --> 05:10.689
[laughter]

05:10.724 --> 05:13.658
-Seriously, she's been obsessed
since primary school.

05:13.692 --> 05:14.728
-It's so sad.

05:14.762 --> 05:16.454
-Not as sad as her
dress-sense.

05:16.488 --> 05:17.386
[laughter]

05:17.420 --> 05:18.559
-Come on, Shannon.

05:18.594 --> 05:19.905
-You know what?

05:19.940 --> 05:21.113
I think I'm just going
to go home.

05:21.148 --> 05:22.701
-Come to mine.

05:22.736 --> 05:24.600
We'll make dark chocolate
biscuits and we'll watch some

05:24.634 --> 05:25.428
films.

05:25.463 --> 05:27.706
-I think I'll leave it.

05:27.741 --> 05:28.949
-Who are you?

05:28.983 --> 05:31.365
And what have you done
with Shannon Kelly?

05:31.400 --> 05:32.504
-Sorry, Mads.

06:05.054 --> 06:08.954
[crying]

06:18.964 --> 06:20.103
-Hay fever?

06:26.213 --> 06:28.491
You're looking for the
monster, I suppose?

06:28.526 --> 06:30.631
-Rhydian, just leave it, OK?

06:41.815 --> 06:43.437
-Why are you so interested
in it, then?

06:49.995 --> 06:54.483
-I was seven and I was this
camping trip with the

06:54.517 --> 06:56.657
Brownies, not far from here.

06:56.692 --> 07:01.144
We'd all gone to bed for the
night, but I couldn't sleep.

07:01.179 --> 07:04.700
There were sounds of
things outside.

07:04.734 --> 07:06.805
Probably badgers and stuff.

07:06.840 --> 07:10.291
But you know how your
imagination plays tricks.

07:10.326 --> 07:11.603
I was playing shadow monsters.

07:14.019 --> 07:17.057
Then there was a real shadow
on the outside.

07:17.091 --> 07:20.957
So I turned off my torch
and it came closer.

07:23.339 --> 07:24.616
It was right over us.

07:27.205 --> 07:31.140
I thought it was just one of my
friends, and so I unzipped

07:31.174 --> 07:35.144
the tent to have a look.

07:35.178 --> 07:42.496
And there it was, this monstrous
face, hairy, with--

07:42.531 --> 07:45.913
with these yellow eyes.

07:45.948 --> 07:51.850
I screamed so loudly it woke
up the whole camp.

07:51.885 --> 07:56.061
-So what do you think it was?

07:56.096 --> 07:58.512
-I don't know.

07:58.547 --> 08:03.690
But when I got back to school
everyone had heard.

08:03.724 --> 08:05.243
They started making fun of me.

08:09.558 --> 08:12.561
I was even sent to a
child psychologist.

08:12.595 --> 08:14.252
-What for?

08:14.286 --> 08:18.221
-I wouldn't shut up about
what I'd seen.

08:18.256 --> 08:20.189
Everyone said I was just
doing it for attention.

08:23.951 --> 08:27.783
-It's not nice to be accused
of lying, is it?

08:27.817 --> 08:28.922
-Exactly.

08:32.201 --> 08:37.895
-You know, chocolate
helps hay fever.

08:37.931 --> 08:39.277
-Are you sure you
don't want it?

08:39.311 --> 08:40.554
-Naw, I'm good.

08:43.073 --> 08:45.835
-Vegan chocolate.

08:45.870 --> 08:49.287
-My foster parents
are vegetarians.

08:49.321 --> 08:50.702
-Mm.

08:50.737 --> 08:51.634
-Enjoy.

09:03.922 --> 09:07.132
[knocking]

09:07.167 --> 09:08.720
-We're just going food
shopping, there.

09:08.755 --> 09:10.895
So is Rhydian coming
round tomorrow?

09:10.929 --> 09:13.035
-I don't know.

09:13.069 --> 09:15.589
-Oh, what's wrong?

09:15.624 --> 09:17.039
Come on.

09:17.073 --> 09:18.143
You've had your tail between
you legs since you came in.

09:18.178 --> 09:19.835
What's brought this on?

09:19.869 --> 09:21.008
-Nothing.

09:23.114 --> 09:27.083
Uh, I'm just fed up with
lying all the time.

09:27.118 --> 09:28.291
It's not cool.

09:28.326 --> 09:31.743
I can't even tell my friends
who I really am.

09:31.778 --> 09:36.023
-Well, there's one friend you
don't have to lie to.

09:36.058 --> 09:38.198
Make an effort with
him, Maddy.

09:38.232 --> 09:39.786
He could learn a lot from you.

09:39.820 --> 09:41.373
-He won't listen to us.

09:41.408 --> 09:43.721
-Well, just be patient
with him.

09:43.755 --> 09:45.308
When the poor lad's
never had a real

09:45.343 --> 09:48.726
family, let alone a pack.

09:48.760 --> 09:50.037
We have to look out
for each other.

10:07.192 --> 10:07.848
-Hey, Shan.

10:07.883 --> 10:08.780
Are you OK?

10:08.815 --> 10:10.264
-Yeah, why?

10:10.299 --> 10:12.439
-Oh, it's just that you were
really upset yesterday, and I

10:12.473 --> 10:14.752
thought you might have
went on a rampage.

10:14.786 --> 10:17.651
-Saturday, bring your camera.

10:17.686 --> 10:18.825
-Mm, cool.

10:23.208 --> 10:24.727
Hi.

10:24.762 --> 10:25.866
-What?

10:25.901 --> 10:27.730
-I'm really sorry about
the memory card.

10:27.765 --> 10:29.421
You were right to
have taken it.

10:29.456 --> 10:30.388
-Yeah.

10:30.422 --> 10:31.665
Totally.

10:34.254 --> 10:36.256
-Can you just come for
dinner tonight?

10:36.290 --> 10:38.499
Mom and Dad, they want
to talk to us

10:38.534 --> 10:44.713
about wolfing out safely.

10:44.747 --> 10:46.059
I know it's really, really
embarrassing.

10:46.093 --> 10:49.994
But, um, we should just
get it out of the way.

10:50.028 --> 10:52.341
-Out of the way, yeah.

10:52.375 --> 10:55.068
-And then when you change, me
and Mom are going to braid

10:55.102 --> 11:02.800
your hair, with ribbon,
and take pictures.

11:02.834 --> 11:04.077
-Cool.

11:04.111 --> 11:05.285
-You're not even listening
to this, are you?

11:05.319 --> 11:06.976
-Sorry, do you know what's
one the menu?

11:07.011 --> 11:09.841
-Uh, I think Wednesday
is veggie day.

11:09.876 --> 11:11.187
[sigh]

11:14.018 --> 11:14.915
-Meat.

11:14.950 --> 11:15.916
-Where?

11:15.951 --> 11:17.297
-You got cravings.

11:17.331 --> 11:20.334
-They're vegetarians, Maddy.

11:20.369 --> 11:24.269
My foster parents, they're
vegetarians.

11:24.304 --> 11:27.341
-Well, Wednesday is
hog roast night.

11:27.376 --> 11:30.931
You know, where you get a whole
pig and roast it, with

11:30.966 --> 11:31.760
all the trimmings.

11:31.794 --> 11:33.382
-A whole pig?

11:33.416 --> 11:35.004
-Fancy it?

11:35.039 --> 11:35.902
-Yeah.

11:35.936 --> 11:38.111
-Cool.

11:38.145 --> 11:39.526
-I can't look at another
vegetable.

11:43.254 --> 11:45.049
-Macaroni cheese, please.

11:45.083 --> 11:47.568
[laughter]

11:47.603 --> 11:48.984
Ooh, you're frightened?

11:49.018 --> 11:50.157
-It was the most terrifying
thing I've

11:50.192 --> 11:51.849
ever seen in my life.

11:51.883 --> 11:53.540
[laughter]

11:53.574 --> 11:54.265
-It's here!

11:54.299 --> 11:55.404
Save yourself!

11:55.438 --> 11:56.854
-Stop mocking me!

11:56.888 --> 11:58.200
-It's going to kill me.

11:58.234 --> 11:59.270
-Give it here.

11:59.304 --> 12:01.030
-What on earth is
going on here?

12:01.065 --> 12:03.895
-She just went for me, sir.

12:03.930 --> 12:05.103
-More posters?

12:05.138 --> 12:05.932
-She needs help.

12:05.966 --> 12:07.243
-I don't need help.

12:07.278 --> 12:08.382
That monster's real, and
I'm going to prove it.

12:08.417 --> 12:10.764
-Well, you can do it
after detention.

12:10.799 --> 12:11.316
-What?

12:11.351 --> 12:12.076
Another one?

12:12.110 --> 12:13.422
-All of you.

12:13.456 --> 12:14.734
-Ugh!

12:18.047 --> 12:19.600
-[WHISPERING] Please Shannon,
not tonight.

12:19.635 --> 12:21.464
I thought we were going
this weekend?

12:21.499 --> 12:22.500
-[sigh]

12:22.534 --> 12:24.502
Did Scott wait until
the weekend?

12:24.536 --> 12:27.505
-Yeah, but he died.

12:27.539 --> 12:30.232
-The point is, the monster could
be gone by the weekend.

12:30.266 --> 12:31.509
It's there, and right now.

12:31.543 --> 12:33.442
-I can't make it tonight.

12:33.476 --> 12:34.926
I've got this dinner thing
with my parents.

12:34.961 --> 12:35.893
-Then get out of it.

12:35.927 --> 12:36.997
-I can't.

12:37.032 --> 12:38.171
They've been nagging
me for weeks.

12:41.036 --> 12:43.624
-Fine, well Tom's coming,
aren't you, Tom?

12:43.659 --> 12:45.937
-Uh, well, there's a new
match on tonight--

12:45.972 --> 12:47.111
MR. JEFFRIES [OFFSCREEN]: Shh!

12:49.147 --> 12:50.977
-Which I will record.

12:51.011 --> 12:52.047
-Good.

12:52.081 --> 12:52.979
We meet at Bernie's,
5 o'clock.

13:02.091 --> 13:04.853
-How long are we going
for, Shan?

13:04.887 --> 13:07.994
-Nope, nope.

13:08.028 --> 13:09.167
A little help.

13:17.175 --> 13:19.177
-Madeline, leave some
for Rhydian.

13:19.212 --> 13:21.214
-Mom, I think he'll live.

13:21.248 --> 13:23.595
-Uh, you mother's gone through
a lot of trouble for this.

13:23.630 --> 13:27.841
After all, the steaks
are high.

13:27.876 --> 13:29.049
[laughter]

13:29.084 --> 13:31.120
-Stop it, you silly sausage.

13:31.155 --> 13:32.363
[laughter]

13:32.397 --> 13:34.468
-No, seriously, you two
better stop that.

13:34.503 --> 13:36.677
-Hey, I ham stopping.

13:36.712 --> 13:37.471
-Right, that's it.

13:37.506 --> 13:38.334
I'm calling him.

13:38.369 --> 13:39.059
He's not coming.

13:39.094 --> 13:39.888
[knocking]

13:39.922 --> 13:41.061
-Oh, that'll be him.

13:44.513 --> 13:46.998
Rhydian, I'm Daniel.

13:47.033 --> 13:49.207
Come on in.

13:49.242 --> 13:51.900
Please to, uh, meat you.

13:51.934 --> 13:53.177
[laughter]

13:59.597 --> 14:00.529
-Help yourself, mate.

14:00.563 --> 14:02.013
Have as much as you like.

14:11.505 --> 14:13.507
-It's got to be cool
having a family you

14:13.542 --> 14:15.164
can be yourself around.

14:15.199 --> 14:18.340
-Well, you're more than welcome
anytime you want.

14:18.374 --> 14:20.342
And if you've got any
questions about

14:20.376 --> 14:22.137
anything, just ask.

14:26.658 --> 14:31.042
-On the full moon, do you change
in the house, in here?

14:31.077 --> 14:34.597
-No, we got a secure
room in the cellar.

14:34.632 --> 14:35.909
-The cellar?

14:49.509 --> 14:50.993
-You like it?

14:51.028 --> 14:53.168
-We call it the den.

14:53.202 --> 14:56.447
It's got everything a wolf
desires, and it's safe for us,

14:56.481 --> 14:59.105
and, well, for everyone else.

14:59.139 --> 15:00.244
It's all about responsibility.

15:02.694 --> 15:06.250
-But don't you ever just
want to run free?

15:06.284 --> 15:07.768
Isn't that what being
a wolfblood's about?

15:07.803 --> 15:11.013
-No, being a wolfblood is not
just about given in to our

15:11.048 --> 15:12.497
primal desires.

15:12.532 --> 15:15.742
It's about being a responsible
part of a wider community.

15:15.776 --> 15:17.951
-Yeah, we got a rich heritage
and culture.

15:17.986 --> 15:20.678
And we got books here that you
won't find in school library.

15:20.712 --> 15:22.645
It's true that Rome was founded
by the wolfbloods

15:22.680 --> 15:24.233
Romulus and Remus.

15:24.268 --> 15:26.166
And Genghis Khan's tribe weren't
called the wolves for

15:26.201 --> 15:27.616
nothing.

15:27.650 --> 15:28.755
-Yeah, but most of us agree that
it's better to tame out

15:28.789 --> 15:29.790
of instincts.

15:29.825 --> 15:31.654
-Most of us?

15:31.689 --> 15:32.793
Yeah, I just meant that--

15:32.828 --> 15:35.382
-No, you said, most of us.

15:35.417 --> 15:36.763
You always taught us
that we all kept

15:36.797 --> 15:38.247
ourselves locked away.

15:38.282 --> 15:39.076
-Maybe we should--

15:39.110 --> 15:40.318
-She's not old enough.

15:40.353 --> 15:42.493
-Old enough for what?

15:42.527 --> 15:45.530
-There are other wolfbloods
that don't lock themselves

15:45.565 --> 15:47.222
away, aren't there?

15:50.777 --> 15:52.503
-La, la, la, la, la, la.

15:52.537 --> 15:53.814
SHANNON [OFFSCREEN]: Shut up!

15:53.849 --> 15:55.299
You'll scare the monster
away with that racket.

15:55.333 --> 15:56.472
-[SARCASTICALLY] Well sorry!

15:59.234 --> 16:01.512
Have you got any food in here?

16:01.546 --> 16:04.446
-Do I?

16:04.480 --> 16:06.137
Let's have a look.

16:06.172 --> 16:09.313
Ah, I've got some sandwiches,
cheese, loads of chocolate,

16:09.347 --> 16:10.107
loads of chocolate.

16:10.141 --> 16:11.487
-Is that true?

16:11.522 --> 16:13.144
We were going to tell you
after you transformed.

16:13.179 --> 16:14.145
-We didn't want to scare you.

16:14.180 --> 16:15.560
-Scare us?

16:15.595 --> 16:18.598
-There are other wolfbloods who,
well, they don't quite

16:18.632 --> 16:20.358
share the same values as us.

16:20.393 --> 16:21.497
-Wild wolfbloods.

16:21.532 --> 16:23.120
-But they're very rare.

16:23.154 --> 16:25.467
And most of us agree, it's
better to be a useful part of

16:25.501 --> 16:27.055
society instead of--

16:27.089 --> 16:28.297
-Instead of what?

16:28.332 --> 16:31.818
-Instead of hating humans,
and hating us.

16:31.852 --> 16:33.509
They're dangerous.

16:33.544 --> 16:34.855
-It wasn't you in that photo.

16:34.890 --> 16:38.135
-I told you it wasn't.

16:38.169 --> 16:41.414
-Shannon and Tom
are out there.

16:41.448 --> 16:42.553
-What's wrong?

16:42.587 --> 16:43.657
-We've got some beans.

16:43.692 --> 16:45.314
We could heat them up.

16:45.349 --> 16:47.075
And we've got bacon
and sausages.

16:47.109 --> 16:49.318
Aw, this is going
to be lovely.

16:49.353 --> 16:49.870
Oh!

16:49.905 --> 16:50.837
-All right.

16:50.871 --> 16:52.218
You got any crisps, Shan?

16:52.252 --> 16:53.391
[twigs breaking]

16:53.426 --> 16:54.806
-What was that?

16:54.841 --> 16:56.636
-What?

16:56.670 --> 16:57.809
-There's something over there.

17:05.921 --> 17:06.749
-Oh, you know what?

17:06.784 --> 17:07.785
I think we should go.

17:07.819 --> 17:09.097
Look, the fog's getting
thicker.

17:09.131 --> 17:09.373
We clearly aren't going
to see anything.

17:16.414 --> 17:19.141
-Look, Shannon took
it the other day.

17:19.175 --> 17:20.901
I thought it was Rhydian,
because I didn't know about

17:20.935 --> 17:22.593
wild wolfbloods.

17:22.627 --> 17:23.421
-Where did they go?

17:23.455 --> 17:24.905
-To the woods, here.

17:24.940 --> 17:25.630
-Yeah, but where?

17:25.665 --> 17:27.252
Where is here?

17:27.287 --> 17:29.565
-Uh, I can't explain,
but I can find it.

17:29.600 --> 17:31.257
-No, you two stay here.

17:31.291 --> 17:32.258
-We're coming with you.

17:32.292 --> 17:33.742
-You'll be staying right here.

17:33.776 --> 17:37.090
If there's a wild wolfblood out
there, we'll sniff it out.

17:39.782 --> 17:40.611
-Well, this is ridiculous.

17:40.645 --> 17:41.784
I know where they are.

17:41.819 --> 17:42.613
-Mom and Dad know what
they're doing.

17:42.647 --> 17:44.235
-What, in their car?

17:44.270 --> 17:46.168
If that wolf's out there, he's
using his senses, and he's

17:46.203 --> 17:47.894
going to hunt down
Tom and Shannon.

17:47.928 --> 17:51.242
We can get there first.

17:51.277 --> 17:52.761
-You're right.

17:52.795 --> 17:55.246
But no wolfing out.

17:55.281 --> 17:56.420
Shannon's got a camera.

18:00.872 --> 18:01.942
-Oh, come on, Shannon.

18:01.977 --> 18:03.599
That was just a badger,
all right.

18:03.634 --> 18:05.325
A fox, maybe a rabbit?

18:05.360 --> 18:06.499
-Shush!

18:09.433 --> 18:14.127
[wolf growling]

18:14.162 --> 18:17.199
-That's a big badger, Shan.

18:17.234 --> 18:18.511
-It's really close.

18:18.545 --> 18:19.305
[wolf growling]

18:19.339 --> 18:20.340
-6 o'clock.

18:20.375 --> 18:21.376
Naw, it's nearly 7.

18:21.410 --> 18:23.757
-No, I mean it's right
behind us.

18:27.520 --> 18:28.486
[yelling]

18:28.521 --> 18:29.315
[laughter]

18:29.349 --> 18:29.867
-Oh!

18:29.901 --> 18:30.592
Your faces!

18:30.626 --> 18:31.386
-Oh, you idiots.

18:31.420 --> 18:32.352
You're not funny!

18:32.387 --> 18:33.388
-You found the monster yet?

18:33.422 --> 18:34.354
-No, thanks to you.

18:34.389 --> 18:35.459
You probably scared it off.

18:35.493 --> 18:36.839
-Oh, please!

18:36.874 --> 18:38.255
-Yeah, what kind of monsters
would be scared of us?

18:38.289 --> 18:40.774
[wolf howling]

18:40.809 --> 18:41.948
-Wuh-- what was that?

18:48.196 --> 18:49.473
-It was just a dog.

18:49.507 --> 18:50.922
I know, he must have wondered
into the woods.

18:50.957 --> 18:52.510
-That's not a dog,
it's the monster.

18:52.545 --> 18:53.960
It's my monster.

18:53.994 --> 18:55.824
-I'm not hanging around
to find out.

18:55.858 --> 18:57.722
-Look, if you run it
will chase you.

19:02.417 --> 19:05.558
[yelling]

19:05.592 --> 19:06.973
-Are you OK?

19:07.007 --> 19:08.975
-Well, we would be, if you
wasn't jumping out at us.

19:09.009 --> 19:10.701
-What you doing here?

19:10.735 --> 19:11.943
-What are you doing here?

19:11.978 --> 19:13.773
I thought you had dinner
with your parents.

19:13.807 --> 19:16.258
-You had dinner with
Rhydian, on a date?

19:16.293 --> 19:16.845
-Oh, shut up.

19:16.879 --> 19:19.572
He's my cousin.

19:19.606 --> 19:21.712
-Guys, guys!

19:21.746 --> 19:22.471
-What was that?

19:22.506 --> 19:23.645
-It's the monster.

19:28.270 --> 19:30.548
[wolf growling]

19:30.583 --> 19:31.377
-Huh?

19:31.411 --> 19:34.311
-That's the monster!

19:34.345 --> 19:34.828
Everybody get behind me.

19:34.863 --> 19:36.175
Mads, Mads!

19:42.526 --> 19:43.630
-Run!

19:49.602 --> 19:50.879
-Ugh!

19:50.913 --> 19:51.811
-Tom, are you OK?

19:51.845 --> 19:52.915
-Oh, I'm out of here.

19:52.950 --> 19:54.296
Yeah, let's go.

19:54.331 --> 19:55.504
-Well, wait for me.

19:55.539 --> 19:56.747
-I thought you didn't
believe in monsters?

19:56.781 --> 19:57.575
-My ankle!

19:57.610 --> 19:58.438
-Give me the camera.

19:58.473 --> 19:59.025
-What?

19:59.059 --> 19:59.991
-The camera!

20:00.026 --> 20:01.579
The flash blinds the monster.

20:01.614 --> 20:02.856
[wolf howling]

20:02.891 --> 20:03.581
-Just give me it!

20:03.616 --> 20:04.548
Stay with Tom.

20:08.483 --> 20:12.003
[wolf growling]

20:12.038 --> 20:13.315
-Rhydian!

20:17.906 --> 20:20.633
Leave him alone!

20:20.667 --> 20:23.463
[wolf howling]

20:23.498 --> 20:27.295
[wolf growling]

20:34.888 --> 20:39.686
[wolf growling]

20:53.390 --> 20:54.529
-Listen!

20:57.083 --> 20:58.360
They've stopped.

21:02.433 --> 21:03.745
Come on, come on.

21:08.025 --> 21:09.475
[grunting]

21:12.823 --> 21:13.927
-Wait.

21:15.688 --> 21:17.448
I'm sorry I didn't
believe you.

21:17.483 --> 21:19.726
-I don't blame you.

21:19.761 --> 21:21.452
We didn't even know about
wild wolfbloods.

21:26.043 --> 21:27.493
-No.

21:27.527 --> 21:28.632
-What's that?

21:31.082 --> 21:32.014
-It's something.

21:32.049 --> 21:33.706
-You can't tell it's a wolf.

21:33.740 --> 21:35.846
-We've got to leave something
for Shannon.

21:35.880 --> 21:38.366
-Yeah.

21:38.400 --> 21:39.574
Anyway, that's my best side.

21:42.542 --> 21:43.957
Where are the others?

21:43.992 --> 21:45.027
-Tom hurt his ankle.

21:45.062 --> 21:46.477
He's with Shannon.

21:46.512 --> 21:49.515
You know Jimi, every
man for himself.

21:49.549 --> 21:52.621
-He's such a wuss.

21:52.656 --> 21:54.105
-Yeah.

21:54.140 --> 21:56.901
Here he is.

21:56.936 --> 22:00.836
So I'll find Tom and Shannon
by myself then, shall I?

22:00.871 --> 22:03.045
Yeah.

22:03.080 --> 22:04.357
Good.

22:11.813 --> 22:12.779
-Argh!

22:12.814 --> 22:13.780
-So what do you think it was?

22:13.815 --> 22:15.782
It had to be the beast, right?

22:15.817 --> 22:17.784
Probably foxes.

22:17.819 --> 22:19.545
I mean, have you ever
seen foxes fight?

22:19.579 --> 22:23.065
They really go for
it, those foxes.

22:23.100 --> 22:24.032
-Hi, you guys.

22:24.066 --> 22:25.930
-Well, where have you been?

22:25.965 --> 22:27.173
-Looking for you guys.

22:27.207 --> 22:30.866
-Anyway, what I saw was
bigger than a fox.

22:30.901 --> 22:32.903
And there's definitely
something out there.

22:32.937 --> 22:33.628
[rumbling]

22:33.662 --> 22:34.491
-What was that?

22:40.773 --> 22:43.534
-Is everyone all right?

22:43.569 --> 22:44.742
-What are you doing here?

22:44.777 --> 22:46.434
-What are you doing here?

22:46.468 --> 22:47.918
-Uh, we--

22:47.952 --> 22:49.160
-Just going for a drive.

22:49.195 --> 22:50.438
-Yeah, because Emma likes
bird watching.

22:50.472 --> 22:51.818
-Dan likes star cruising.

22:51.853 --> 22:53.061
-Tom's hurt his ankle.

22:53.095 --> 22:54.165
-Right.

22:54.200 --> 22:55.166
Let's get him back
to the house.

22:55.201 --> 22:57.652
-Here we go.

22:57.686 --> 22:58.894
-You all right?

22:58.929 --> 23:00.413
-Yeah, just a bit freaked
out, I guess.

23:00.448 --> 23:01.863
-What's this here?

23:01.897 --> 23:03.934
Do you bring my daughter
out here?

23:03.968 --> 23:05.936
-Come on, you two, in you go.

23:11.769 --> 23:13.599
-No.

23:13.633 --> 23:15.877
No.

23:15.911 --> 23:16.464
[sigh]

23:16.498 --> 23:19.087
No.

23:19.121 --> 23:20.226
No.

23:22.297 --> 23:23.194
No.

23:23.229 --> 23:26.094
-Ah, what's that?

23:26.128 --> 23:28.130
Oh.

23:28.165 --> 23:29.649
No, it's just a badger.

23:32.756 --> 23:34.516
-I know it's up there.

23:34.551 --> 23:35.724
I'll find it one day.

23:39.763 --> 23:42.766
-What about that one, Shan?

23:42.800 --> 23:44.630
-It's not very clear.

23:44.664 --> 23:46.494
-Yeah, but you can still
see something, though.

23:46.528 --> 23:48.565
-Yeah, you could definitely use
it on a poster, Shannon.

23:48.599 --> 23:49.531
-Yeah.

23:49.566 --> 23:50.463
-No, I'm done with posters.

23:52.983 --> 23:54.260
-Are sure you're done
with posters?

24:05.202 --> 24:06.686
-What are you looking
at, losers?

24:15.764 --> 24:18.077
[laughter]

24:32.263 --> 24:34.231
-The crybabies of the moors?

24:34.265 --> 24:35.991
I didn't cry.

24:36.026 --> 24:36.751
-Sam did.

24:36.785 --> 24:37.303
-Did not.

24:37.337 --> 24:38.615
Jimi did.
