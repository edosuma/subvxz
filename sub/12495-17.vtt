WEBVTT

00:09.259 --> 00:10.469
- Wh--wait!

00:10.511 --> 00:11.720
Gooch, Schwoz, don't leave!

00:12.220 --> 00:13.722
Let's try to cheer Ray up!

00:13.764 --> 00:16.350
Oh, come on, guys,

00:13.764 --> 00:16.350
you won't even look back at me?

00:17.810 --> 00:19.269
What are Gooch and Schwoz

00:17.810 --> 00:19.269
running from?

00:19.311 --> 00:20.437
Ray.

00:20.479 --> 00:21.772
Because he's

00:20.479 --> 00:21.772
in a really bad mood.

00:21.814 --> 00:22.857
Why?

00:22.898 --> 00:24.358
- Because it's

00:22.898 --> 00:24.358
his super anniversary.

00:24.733 --> 00:25.943
Super...

00:25.985 --> 00:27.903
The anniversary

00:25.985 --> 00:27.903
of when he was eight years old,

00:27.945 --> 00:30.280
when he got densitized

00:27.945 --> 00:30.280
and became indestructible.

00:30.322 --> 00:31.782
Ooh, fun, we should celebrate.

00:31.824 --> 00:32.491
No.

00:32.533 --> 00:33.325
I mean "no."

00:34.493 --> 00:35.703
But why not?

00:36.119 --> 00:38.121
Ray hates his super anniversary.

00:38.163 --> 00:39.581
Why?

00:39.623 --> 00:42.292
Because when Ray's dad

00:39.623 --> 00:42.292
realized he was indestructible,

00:42.334 --> 00:44.043
he took him out of school

00:42.334 --> 00:44.043
and started training him

00:44.085 --> 00:45.128
to be a superhero.

00:45.170 --> 00:46.213
- Yeah?

00:46.254 --> 00:47.840
And now he feels

00:46.254 --> 00:47.840
like he missed out

00:47.882 --> 00:49.717
on all the fun

00:47.882 --> 00:49.717
of being a normal kid.

00:50.133 --> 00:51.927
Aw, that's so sad.

00:51.969 --> 00:52.720
(Henry)

00:51.969 --> 00:52.720
Yeah.

00:53.595 --> 00:56.891
He never got to go camping,

00:53.595 --> 00:56.891
ride roller coasters.

00:56.932 --> 00:58.851
He never even learned

00:56.932 --> 00:58.851
how to ride a bike.

00:58.893 --> 01:00.394
Hmm.

01:00.435 --> 01:02.229
My uncle Rosco never learned

01:00.435 --> 01:02.229
how to ride a bike.

01:02.270 --> 01:03.772
How come?

01:03.814 --> 01:06.233
Because when he was a kid

01:03.814 --> 01:06.233
he already weighed 400 pounds.

01:08.569 --> 01:10.029
The bikes just couldn't take it.

01:10.821 --> 01:11.780
Poor bikes.

01:12.990 --> 01:13.782
(bell rings)

01:13.824 --> 01:15.826
(roaring)

01:16.201 --> 01:18.161
Hey.

01:16.201 --> 01:18.161
Need some help?

01:18.746 --> 01:20.873
I was just wondering if I could

01:18.746 --> 01:20.873
try out that piano over there.

01:20.915 --> 01:22.082
Sure, go ahead.

01:24.043 --> 01:25.627
(music)

01:25.669 --> 01:27.629
Oh, will you help me

01:25.669 --> 01:27.629
organize these bamboo--

01:27.671 --> 01:28.380
(Ray)

01:27.671 --> 01:28.380
Hey, hey, hey!

01:30.173 --> 01:31.633
What's all the racket out here?

01:33.761 --> 01:36.137
- Oh, it's just a customer

01:33.761 --> 01:36.137
checking out the piano.

01:36.680 --> 01:38.057
Hey! Hey you!

01:39.558 --> 01:41.268
Haven't you learned how to play

01:39.558 --> 01:41.268
that crummy song yet?

01:42.019 --> 01:44.438
(cries)

01:46.314 --> 01:47.232
Ray.

01:47.274 --> 01:48.817
Must you torture the children?

01:50.235 --> 01:51.612
Ah, just forget everything.

01:52.320 --> 01:53.864
Stupid super anniversary.

01:55.449 --> 01:56.700
This knob is still loose!

01:58.118 --> 01:58.911
Oh.

01:58.953 --> 02:02.039
(mumbling)

02:02.664 --> 02:06.167
Well, I see why Gooch

02:02.664 --> 02:06.167
and Schwoz got out of here.

02:06.501 --> 02:07.377
I know, right?

02:09.922 --> 02:11.465
Excuse me, kids.

02:11.506 --> 02:14.635
I left $8,000

02:11.506 --> 02:14.635
in a rolled up newspaper.

02:14.676 --> 02:15.677
Have you seen it?

02:16.095 --> 02:17.387
Sorry.

02:17.429 --> 02:19.139
(screaming)

02:17.429 --> 02:19.139
Oh no!

02:19.974 --> 02:21.767
I'm all right!

02:22.768 --> 02:23.811
Can you believe that?

02:23.852 --> 02:24.853
No.

02:25.353 --> 02:27.022
Who still reads newspapers?

02:29.942 --> 02:31.151
It all just kind of happened.

02:31.192 --> 02:33.194
My dad was

02:31.192 --> 02:33.194
an irresponsible scientist.

02:33.904 --> 02:35.572
I wanted an after-school job.

02:35.614 --> 02:38.158
(Captain Man)

02:35.614 --> 02:38.158
And by accident,

02:35.614 --> 02:38.158
he made me indestructible.

02:38.199 --> 02:39.576
Ah!

02:39.618 --> 02:41.870
(Henry)

02:39.618 --> 02:41.870
I went into this crazy store

02:41.912 --> 02:43.789
and met

02:41.912 --> 02:43.789
a pretty interesting guy.

02:43.831 --> 02:44.873
I'm going to blow your mind.

02:45.707 --> 02:47.960
(Captain Man)

02:45.707 --> 02:47.960
Now I protect

02:45.707 --> 02:47.960
the good citizens of Swellview

02:48.002 --> 02:48.961
who call me...

02:49.003 --> 02:50.004
(Henry)

02:49.003 --> 02:50.004
And he turned out to be...

02:50.045 --> 02:51.130
You know the name.

02:51.170 --> 02:53.548
Captain Man!That's right, Henry.

02:53.590 --> 02:55.926
(Captain Man)

02:53.590 --> 02:55.926
In time, I realized

02:53.590 --> 02:55.926
that being a superhero

02:55.968 --> 02:57.511
is a lot to handle alone.

02:57.552 --> 02:58.637
He wanted some help.

02:58.679 --> 03:00.179
(Captain Man)

02:58.679 --> 03:00.179
I needed a sidekick.

03:00.221 --> 03:01.765
(Henry)

03:00.221 --> 03:01.765
I, Henry hart...

03:01.807 --> 03:03.266
(Captain Man)

03:01.807 --> 03:03.266
Pledge to never ever ever...

03:01.807 --> 03:03.266
tell anyone...

03:03.308 --> 03:05.853
That I'm Captain Man's

03:03.308 --> 03:05.853
It is done.ecret sidekick.

03:05.894 --> 03:06.937
(Henry)

03:05.894 --> 03:06.937
Now we blow bubbles.

03:06.979 --> 03:08.480
(Captain Man)

03:06.979 --> 03:08.480
And fight crime.

03:08.522 --> 03:09.481
(Henry)

03:08.522 --> 03:09.481
Feels good.

03:10.649 --> 03:15.570
(music)

03:23.704 --> 03:25.998
Up the tube!

03:26.790 --> 03:27.916
(Henry)

03:26.790 --> 03:27.916
Oh, my boot.

03:28.542 --> 03:29.751
(Captain Man)

03:28.542 --> 03:29.751
Ha!

03:36.633 --> 03:37.258
(elevator dings)

03:40.470 --> 03:41.805
Can I take off my blindfold now?

03:41.847 --> 03:42.890
No.

03:42.931 --> 03:44.058
But I can't see anything.

03:44.099 --> 03:45.976
We're not going

03:44.099 --> 03:45.976
Don't worry.

03:46.018 --> 03:47.394
Can't I just--

03:46.018 --> 03:47.394
Aah!

03:47.936 --> 03:49.146
Oh!

03:50.605 --> 03:51.565
Ah!

03:53.067 --> 03:54.442
Did you--

03:55.110 --> 03:56.570
So this is the surprise?

03:57.779 --> 03:59.740
You guys blindfold me

03:57.779 --> 03:59.740
and try to kill me?

04:01.075 --> 04:01.909
No.

04:01.950 --> 04:03.202
Sorry, our bad.

04:07.164 --> 04:08.415
(Henry)

04:07.164 --> 04:08.415
All right, Ray.

04:08.456 --> 04:09.583
Now, whip off that blindfold.

04:12.669 --> 04:15.214
(Both)

04:12.669 --> 04:15.214
Happy super anniversary!

04:23.805 --> 04:24.598
I don't get it.

04:25.849 --> 04:26.808
You are going to have

04:26.850 --> 04:28.810
the ultimate kid's

04:26.850 --> 04:28.810
weekend of fun.

04:29.269 --> 04:30.687
What?

04:29.269 --> 04:30.687
What are you guys talking about?

04:30.729 --> 04:32.689
Since you missed out

04:30.729 --> 04:32.689
on being a real kid...

04:32.731 --> 04:34.191
This weekend we're going to do

04:34.233 --> 04:36.276
all the fun kid stuff

04:34.233 --> 04:36.276
you missed out on.

04:36.735 --> 04:37.903
What? Really?

04:38.361 --> 04:40.655
Yeah.

04:38.361 --> 04:40.655
Look, we got camping equipment.

04:40.697 --> 04:43.283
Tickets to Six Poles

04:40.697 --> 04:43.283
Over Swellview.

04:45.202 --> 04:46.245
A cool new bike.

04:46.828 --> 04:47.704
Whoa.

04:49.790 --> 04:50.707
Hold up.

04:51.959 --> 04:53.334
I don't know how to ride a bike.

04:54.920 --> 04:56.088
Gooch told us.

04:56.130 --> 04:57.256
So we're going to teach you.

04:57.881 --> 04:58.590
Honest?

04:58.966 --> 04:59.716
Totally.

04:59.758 --> 05:00.675
Yeah.

05:01.009 --> 05:03.011
Hey, you even got us

05:01.009 --> 05:03.011
matching T-shirts.

05:03.053 --> 05:04.387
-Yep.

05:03.053 --> 05:04.387
-Uh-huh.

05:05.346 --> 05:07.515
For Ray's weekend of fum.

05:09.601 --> 05:10.393
Fum?

05:10.644 --> 05:11.895
The T-shirt store messed up.

05:11.937 --> 05:13.188
Oh, okay.

05:13.230 --> 05:14.564
But why are there five T-shirts?

05:16.108 --> 05:17.234
Tell Ray who's coming.

05:19.903 --> 05:22.239
Our friend Jasper and

05:19.903 --> 05:22.239
Henry's little sister, Piper.

05:22.990 --> 05:24.866
Aw, no. Why?

05:25.951 --> 05:27.702
Well, Piper sprained her ankle.

05:27.744 --> 05:28.578
So?

05:29.412 --> 05:30.914
She's on crutches.

05:30.956 --> 05:33.250
So when we get to Six Poles,

05:33.292 --> 05:35.627
we get to go to the front

05:33.292 --> 05:35.627
of the line for all the rides.

05:35.669 --> 05:37.254
Ah.

05:38.046 --> 05:39.506
And why are we bringing

05:39.547 --> 05:40.841
your bucket-loving friend

05:39.547 --> 05:40.841
with the sweaty hands?

05:41.842 --> 05:43.468
Because that's

05:41.842 --> 05:43.468
Jasper's camping stuff.

05:43.510 --> 05:46.429
And when you get to know him,

05:43.510 --> 05:46.429
he's a lot of fum.

05:48.140 --> 05:50.725
Now, put on your T-shirt

05:48.140 --> 05:50.725
and let the fum begin.

05:52.477 --> 05:55.396
You know, you guys are

05:52.477 --> 05:55.396
really sweet to do

05:52.477 --> 05:55.396
all this for me.

05:55.438 --> 05:57.565
Is it really time for me

05:55.438 --> 05:57.565
to put on my special T-shirt?

05:57.607 --> 05:58.775
- Sure. Go for it.

05:57.607 --> 05:58.775
- Yeah, get in there.

05:59.318 --> 06:00.902
(bell ringing)

06:01.695 --> 06:02.737
Someone's ringing

06:01.695 --> 06:02.737
the bell upstairs.

06:02.779 --> 06:03.613
I'll check it.

06:07.701 --> 06:09.744
Ah, it's Jasper and Piper.

06:07.701 --> 06:09.744
I'll let them in.

06:10.204 --> 06:11.079
(door buzzes)

06:21.506 --> 06:23.133
This one might be Piper's.

06:27.679 --> 06:29.097
Move, I'm injured.

06:29.973 --> 06:30.765
Pushy.

06:31.390 --> 06:32.893
Hey Henry, where are you?

06:32.934 --> 06:34.519
Hurry up!

06:34.561 --> 06:37.689
You know, one day I would love

06:34.561 --> 06:37.689
to have my own store.

06:38.315 --> 06:39.398
Yawn.

06:41.735 --> 06:43.904
(Jasper)

06:41.735 --> 06:43.904
Hey, there's a bunch

06:41.735 --> 06:43.904
of switches back here.

06:44.863 --> 06:47.699
Oh, this one says

06:44.863 --> 06:47.699
"dinosaur flames."

06:49.492 --> 06:51.161
(roaring)

06:51.661 --> 06:53.330
Yeah. I did that.

06:54.706 --> 06:57.542
Yeah, you're a big boy now.

06:58.459 --> 07:01.796
Ooh, this one says

06:58.459 --> 07:01.796
"release drum set."

07:02.339 --> 07:03.298
I wonder what that does.

07:10.680 --> 07:14.017
You almost dropped

07:10.680 --> 07:14.017
an entire drum set on my head!

07:14.851 --> 07:17.645
Not an entire drum set.

07:14.851 --> 07:17.645
I didn't see any cymbals.

07:22.817 --> 07:23.651
Weird.

07:24.319 --> 07:26.238
This one says

07:24.319 --> 07:26.238
"emergency lock down."

07:26.821 --> 07:27.614
Hmm.

07:28.156 --> 07:29.366
Don't flip that lever.

07:29.408 --> 07:32.327
Hey.

07:29.408 --> 07:32.327
I'm the big boy here.

07:35.455 --> 07:40.335
(alarm buzzing)

07:43.213 --> 07:44.547
What's going on?

07:44.589 --> 07:46.425
I don't know, but I hope

07:44.589 --> 07:46.425
it's not what I think it is.

07:48.009 --> 07:49.010
What did you do?

07:49.052 --> 07:50.429
I flipped the lever.

07:50.470 --> 07:52.973
Well, I told you not

07:50.470 --> 07:52.973
to flip the lever.

07:53.014 --> 07:54.182
I should've listened!

07:56.601 --> 07:57.518
There.

07:58.519 --> 07:59.313
What happened?

08:00.521 --> 08:01.606
Go see if the elevator works.

08:01.856 --> 08:02.732
Okay.

08:04.192 --> 08:05.026
(zapping)

08:04.192 --> 08:05.026
Ow.

08:05.402 --> 08:06.694
The button shocked me.

08:06.736 --> 08:07.988
No way.

08:08.029 --> 08:10.365
(zapping)

08:08.029 --> 08:10.365
Ow! The button shocked me.

08:11.950 --> 08:13.534
Henry, try the big sprocket.

08:13.576 --> 08:15.162
Charlotte, go see

08:13.576 --> 08:15.162
if the secret door opens.

08:23.837 --> 08:25.046
Dah, it won't go up.

08:25.588 --> 08:27.048
Why won't this door open?

08:27.090 --> 08:28.383
Ah.

08:28.425 --> 08:30.218
What?

08:28.425 --> 08:30.218
The tube's not working either?

08:30.510 --> 08:31.511
Nope.

08:31.970 --> 08:33.554
We're on emergency lock down.

08:33.930 --> 08:34.931
What does that mean?

08:35.474 --> 08:36.975
It's part

08:35.474 --> 08:36.975
of our security system.

08:37.017 --> 08:38.935
(Ray)

08:37.017 --> 08:38.935
If some criminal finds out

08:37.017 --> 08:38.935
that I work down here

08:38.977 --> 08:40.520
and tries to force his way in,

08:40.561 --> 08:44.024
Gooch can flip a switch upstairs

08:40.561 --> 08:44.024
and lock the whole place down.

08:44.565 --> 08:48.278
But the only people

08:44.565 --> 08:48.278
upstairs now are Piper and...

08:49.488 --> 08:51.323
(Both)

08:49.488 --> 08:51.323
Jasper.

08:52.949 --> 08:53.908
Who you calling?

08:53.950 --> 08:55.076
Jasper.

08:53.950 --> 08:55.076
To let him know to flip--

08:55.118 --> 08:55.785
Nope.

08:56.203 --> 08:57.829
What?

08:57.871 --> 09:00.207
Emergency lock down mode blocks

08:57.871 --> 09:00.207
all transmitters and receivers,

09:00.248 --> 09:01.916
including cell phones.

09:01.958 --> 09:04.211
(screaming)

09:07.630 --> 09:09.632
Piper, be quiet.

09:09.674 --> 09:11.301
I'm trying to open the door.

09:11.759 --> 09:14.137
But my phone's

09:11.759 --> 09:14.137
not getting any signal.

09:14.179 --> 09:16.556
Well, try moving around.

09:22.812 --> 09:23.938
(zapping)

09:22.812 --> 09:23.938
Ow.

09:26.024 --> 09:27.817
(zapping)

09:26.024 --> 09:27.817
Ah.

09:28.568 --> 09:29.944
You see that?

09:29.986 --> 09:32.280
It's like a force field

09:29.986 --> 09:32.280
blocking me from...

09:34.574 --> 09:35.700
Hey.

09:35.742 --> 09:37.577
You're walking

09:35.742 --> 09:37.577
without your crutches.

09:38.119 --> 09:39.204
So?

09:39.246 --> 09:40.914
You don't have a sprained ankle.

09:41.456 --> 09:42.874
Der.

09:44.042 --> 09:44.876
Why'd you lie?

09:45.710 --> 09:49.839
Because we're going to Six Poles

09:45.710 --> 09:49.839
to ride roller coasters,

09:49.881 --> 09:51.925
and when you're on crutches

09:51.966 --> 09:53.927
they let you cut

09:51.966 --> 09:53.927
to the front of the line.

09:55.053 --> 09:57.013
You're so bad.

10:01.017 --> 10:02.436
(Henry)

10:01.017 --> 10:02.436
Can't you cancel the lock down?

10:03.019 --> 10:04.104
Arg. No.

10:05.021 --> 10:06.147
Not for 48 hours.

10:06.689 --> 10:07.941
That's two days.

10:08.442 --> 10:10.402
Yes, your math is perfect.

10:11.903 --> 10:13.071
Well,

10:11.903 --> 10:13.071
I don't get why we can't just--

10:13.113 --> 10:15.198
Listen.

10:13.113 --> 10:15.198
The lock down is on a timer.

10:15.240 --> 10:16.575
Once you flip that switch,

10:16.616 --> 10:18.118
this whole place

10:16.616 --> 10:18.118
is like a bank vault.

10:18.159 --> 10:19.035
Sealed tight.

10:19.494 --> 10:20.787
Nobody gets in or out.

10:21.621 --> 10:22.872
And there's nothing

10:21.621 --> 10:22.872
on this Earth

10:22.914 --> 10:23.957
that can change that.

10:25.542 --> 10:26.667
Except for Schwoz,

10:26.709 --> 10:28.253
and he's with Gooch

10:26.709 --> 10:28.253
in Palm Springs.

10:29.421 --> 10:32.090
So, upstairs, Junk-n-Stuff

10:29.421 --> 10:32.090
is on lock down, too?

10:32.132 --> 10:33.633
Uh-huh.

10:33.674 --> 10:37.095
Which means Jasper and Piper

10:33.674 --> 10:37.095
are trapped up there together.

10:37.512 --> 10:38.888
Oh my God.

10:42.225 --> 10:44.060
(Piper)

10:42.225 --> 10:44.060
This is your fault!

10:44.102 --> 10:45.686
(Jasper)

10:44.102 --> 10:45.686
I didn't know!

10:45.728 --> 10:47.522
(Piper)

10:45.728 --> 10:47.522
You've ruined everything!

10:47.564 --> 10:49.399
(Jasper)

10:47.564 --> 10:49.399
I didn't know!

10:49.441 --> 10:51.443
(Piper)

10:49.441 --> 10:51.443
You tried to kill me with drums!

10:51.485 --> 10:54.488
(Jasper)

10:51.485 --> 10:54.488
I didn't know!

11:01.620 --> 11:04.080
And just one more battery

11:01.620 --> 11:04.080
to connect.

11:05.582 --> 11:06.791
Okay.

11:05.582 --> 11:06.791
The panel's all set.

11:06.833 --> 11:07.501
(Ray)

11:06.833 --> 11:07.501
Good.

11:08.376 --> 11:10.044
Now, hopefully these batteries

11:08.376 --> 11:10.044
will produce enough power

11:10.086 --> 11:12.339
to get one tube working

11:10.086 --> 11:12.339
so we can get out of here.

11:12.380 --> 11:13.590
Who's going up the tube?

11:13.632 --> 11:14.341
It has to be Charlotte.

11:14.382 --> 11:15.674
Why?

11:15.716 --> 11:16.843
Because we don't have

11:15.716 --> 11:16.843
much power here,

11:16.884 --> 11:17.718
and she's the lightest.

11:17.760 --> 11:19.053
Yeah. Chubby.

11:23.808 --> 11:24.976
Okay, Charlotte,

11:23.808 --> 11:24.976
get up there.

11:25.018 --> 11:26.520
You don't have to tell me twice.

11:26.978 --> 11:28.522
You better come back for us.

11:28.563 --> 11:29.272
And bring a pizza.

11:29.314 --> 11:30.315
A big pizza.

11:31.316 --> 11:32.775
Let's just get me

11:31.316 --> 11:32.775
out of here first.

11:33.151 --> 11:33.776
Stand by.

11:45.038 --> 11:46.581
Good.

11:45.038 --> 11:46.581
Now, go for it.

11:47.290 --> 11:48.082
Up the tube!

11:57.758 --> 11:59.511
Increase suckage!

11:59.553 --> 12:00.887
Increasing suckage!

12:02.639 --> 12:03.264
(Charlotte)

12:02.639 --> 12:03.264
Bye!

12:07.268 --> 12:09.062
(laughing)

12:09.103 --> 12:10.021
It worked.

12:11.398 --> 12:12.273
(Both)

12:11.398 --> 12:12.273
Boom.

12:12.315 --> 12:14.693
(screams)

12:16.444 --> 12:17.612
(screaming)

12:19.947 --> 12:21.032
Ugh.

12:21.074 --> 12:22.075
You didn't get the big pizza.

12:22.116 --> 12:23.660
No, I didn't get the big pizza!

12:26.996 --> 12:27.581
Open.

12:27.622 --> 12:29.040
(zapping)

12:27.622 --> 12:29.040
Gah.

12:29.624 --> 12:30.625
Open.

12:30.667 --> 12:31.918
(zapping)

12:30.667 --> 12:31.918
Gah.

12:31.959 --> 12:33.253
(Jasper)

12:31.959 --> 12:33.253
Piper, get back in here.

12:34.128 --> 12:36.631
Ugh!

12:36.673 --> 12:38.633
The elevator won't open.

12:39.175 --> 12:40.385
So?

12:40.427 --> 12:42.053
We don't even know

12:40.427 --> 12:42.053
where that elevator goes.

12:42.596 --> 12:45.682
I know it goes away from you

12:42.596 --> 12:45.682
and that's enough.

12:47.726 --> 12:49.977
Why don't you just sit down

12:47.726 --> 12:49.977
and relax?

12:50.437 --> 12:52.813
I haven't had phone service

12:50.437 --> 12:52.813
in eight hours.

12:53.440 --> 12:56.610
I can't check my texts

12:53.440 --> 12:56.610
or my Twit-Flash.

12:56.651 --> 12:59.279
Things are trending

12:56.651 --> 12:59.279
and I don't know what they are!

13:00.988 --> 13:02.781
Instead of yelling at me,

13:02.823 --> 13:04.492
don't you think it'd

13:02.823 --> 13:04.492
be better if we talk

13:04.534 --> 13:05.702
about our food situation?

13:06.369 --> 13:07.537
Yeah, I'm starving.

13:07.579 --> 13:08.496
Me too.

13:09.038 --> 13:10.831
So, what's our food situation?

13:10.873 --> 13:12.208
We don't have any.

13:12.584 --> 13:14.544
Dah.

13:14.586 --> 13:15.629
(Jasper)

13:14.586 --> 13:15.629
Don't worry--

13:15.670 --> 13:17.046
We all better get out of here

13:17.088 --> 13:18.757
before those two

13:17.088 --> 13:18.757
kill each other.

13:19.132 --> 13:20.258
They won't kill each other.

13:20.759 --> 13:22.135
She'll kill him.

13:27.265 --> 13:29.016
I knew I never

13:27.265 --> 13:29.016
should've got excited

13:29.058 --> 13:31.060
about my dumb super anniversary.

13:31.352 --> 13:32.646
Hey.

13:32.687 --> 13:35.022
I'm really sorry Jasper

13:32.687 --> 13:35.022
got us trapped down here.

13:35.064 --> 13:37.358
And ruined the fun weekend

13:35.064 --> 13:37.358
we had planned for you.

13:37.900 --> 13:39.026
It's not your guys' fault.

13:39.860 --> 13:41.321
My super anniversary is cursed.

13:42.530 --> 13:43.490
Hey.

13:44.240 --> 13:45.950
Maybe the weekend's not ruined.

13:46.743 --> 13:47.535
What do you mean?

13:47.661 --> 13:48.578
What do you mean?

13:49.621 --> 13:51.414
All the stuff we planned

13:49.621 --> 13:51.414
for your super anniversary

13:51.456 --> 13:53.333
can still happen right here

13:51.456 --> 13:53.333
in the man cave.

13:53.708 --> 13:54.626
No, it can't.

13:54.668 --> 13:55.585
What are you saying?

13:55.627 --> 13:56.461
Words.

13:57.295 --> 13:59.297
We got all this cool stuff

13:57.295 --> 13:59.297
we brought

13:59.339 --> 14:00.799
and there's other junk

13:59.339 --> 14:00.799
around here we can use.

14:00.839 --> 14:02.175
Kid--

14:02.216 --> 14:05.094
We can still go camping,

14:02.216 --> 14:05.094
just indoors.

14:06.095 --> 14:07.722
There's even enough room

14:06.095 --> 14:07.722
down here

14:07.764 --> 14:09.223
to teach Ray how to ride a bike.

14:09.890 --> 14:11.976
His enthusiasm's infectious.

14:13.687 --> 14:14.771
What do you say, Ray?

14:15.438 --> 14:16.105
I say...

14:18.899 --> 14:21.027
Let's have some fum.

14:21.695 --> 14:22.779
Let's do it.

14:26.032 --> 14:27.200
Don't let go.

14:27.241 --> 14:28.117
You're fine.

14:28.159 --> 14:29.285
You're also indestructible.

14:30.370 --> 14:31.912
Well,

14:30.370 --> 14:31.912
I still don't want to fall.

14:31.954 --> 14:34.874
Just look ahead,

14:31.954 --> 14:34.874
keep your back straight,

14:31.954 --> 14:34.874
your butt rigid,

14:34.915 --> 14:36.417
and pump your legs

14:34.915 --> 14:36.417
until you get to Charlotte.

14:36.459 --> 14:37.377
Okay.

14:41.631 --> 14:43.550
(Ray)

14:41.631 --> 14:43.550
Ha ha, I'm riding!

14:43.591 --> 14:45.301
I'm doing it!

14:45.343 --> 14:47.094
I'm riding!

14:47.762 --> 14:49.222
(laughing)

14:50.849 --> 14:52.892
Come on, just give me one bar.

14:52.933 --> 14:54.686
You're not going

14:52.933 --> 14:54.686
to get a signal.

14:54.728 --> 14:56.145
I have to try!

14:58.690 --> 15:00.734
Well, after I finish

14:58.690 --> 15:00.734
putting this drum set together,

15:00.775 --> 15:02.109
I'm going to get us out of here.

15:02.652 --> 15:03.403
How?

15:04.237 --> 15:06.614
I'll play them really loud.

15:07.198 --> 15:10.368
Maybe someone will hear,

15:07.198 --> 15:10.368
call the cops to complain,

15:10.410 --> 15:12.495
then they'll come bust down

15:10.410 --> 15:12.495
that door and save us.

15:13.830 --> 15:15.749
Even your good ideas sound bad.

15:15.790 --> 15:17.500
(laughs)

15:19.085 --> 15:21.128
Now, as soon as I start playing,

15:21.170 --> 15:22.922
you start yelling,

15:21.170 --> 15:22.922
"Help. Help us."

15:22.963 --> 15:24.340
Yeah, yeah.

15:24.382 --> 15:26.342
And...

15:24.382 --> 15:26.342
One, two, three, four.

15:34.434 --> 15:35.351
Help.

15:36.394 --> 15:37.061
Help us.

15:37.854 --> 15:39.439
(laughs)

15:44.151 --> 15:46.195
Okay, Ray.

15:44.151 --> 15:46.195
No training wheels.

15:46.821 --> 15:48.114
Ready?

15:48.155 --> 15:49.407
Locked and loaded, baby.

15:49.699 --> 15:50.366
(Henry)

15:49.699 --> 15:50.366
Okay.

15:51.492 --> 15:52.326
Do it!

15:54.579 --> 15:55.955
You got it.

15:54.579 --> 15:55.955
You're doing it, Ray.

15:55.996 --> 15:59.166
I'm doing it.

15:55.996 --> 15:59.166
I'm riding on two wheels.

15:59.876 --> 16:00.877
(all talking at once)

16:00.919 --> 16:02.253
(Ray)

16:00.919 --> 16:02.253
Ah!

16:02.754 --> 16:04.380
(crashing)

16:11.554 --> 16:12.305
I'm okay.

16:19.771 --> 16:21.063
Okay, Piper, ready?

16:21.689 --> 16:22.482
For what?

16:24.484 --> 16:26.569
I'm going to play the drums

16:24.484 --> 16:26.569
as loud as I can,

16:26.611 --> 16:27.570
and you scream for help.

16:28.112 --> 16:30.156
What if I don't want to?

16:31.449 --> 16:33.326
You want to get out of here,

16:31.449 --> 16:33.326
so your phone will work?

16:33.910 --> 16:37.079
Or you want to stay trapped

16:33.910 --> 16:37.079
in here with me all night?

16:38.331 --> 16:39.999
Help!

16:40.040 --> 16:41.334
And one, two, three, four.

16:41.918 --> 16:42.710
Help!

16:43.043 --> 16:44.754
We need somebody!

16:44.796 --> 16:45.672
(Piper)

16:44.796 --> 16:45.672
Help!

16:45.713 --> 16:46.673
(Jasper)

16:45.713 --> 16:46.673
Anybody!

16:47.214 --> 16:48.800
(Both)

16:47.214 --> 16:48.800
Help!

16:48.842 --> 16:51.218
That is the worst cover

16:48.842 --> 16:51.218
of "Help" I've ever heard.

16:51.260 --> 16:52.345
(Piper)

16:51.260 --> 16:52.345
Help!

16:52.386 --> 16:53.680
Ray, come on, we're ready.

16:53.721 --> 16:54.388
Ooh.

16:57.851 --> 16:59.560
Welcome to...

17:00.227 --> 17:02.689
(Both)

17:00.227 --> 17:02.689
Six Poles Over Swellview.

17:04.064 --> 17:05.441
You ready to ride the flume?

17:05.483 --> 17:07.902
Yeah.

17:05.483 --> 17:07.902
What's a flume?

17:07.944 --> 17:08.736
Just get in the log.

17:08.778 --> 17:09.654
That's a cooler.

17:09.696 --> 17:10.822
Pretend it's a log.

17:10.864 --> 17:12.031
I'll get in the log.

17:14.659 --> 17:15.409
Get in there.

17:16.076 --> 17:18.162
Okay.

17:18.788 --> 17:19.622
Like that?

17:19.664 --> 17:21.290
- Okay.

17:19.664 --> 17:21.290
- All right.

17:24.002 --> 17:24.836
Now what?

17:26.004 --> 17:28.297
Please keep your hands and feet

17:26.004 --> 17:28.297
inside the log at all times.

17:28.339 --> 17:30.383
Mantenga las manos y los pies

17:30.424 --> 17:33.427
adentro del tronco

17:30.424 --> 17:33.427
en todo momento, por favor.

17:34.595 --> 17:35.262
¡Gracias!

17:36.347 --> 17:37.306
Now, pull the pin!

17:42.311 --> 17:43.062
Ah.

17:43.103 --> 17:44.104
Splash.

17:45.523 --> 17:46.440
Yes!

17:47.149 --> 17:49.027
That was a lot of fum.

17:53.990 --> 17:56.701
I'm so hungry.

17:57.368 --> 18:01.039
I could eat anything.

18:23.519 --> 18:25.980
Piper, what are you doing?

18:26.022 --> 18:28.148
Shut up, pizza.

18:35.949 --> 18:39.118
I didn't know that camping

18:35.949 --> 18:39.118
involved marshmallows and fire.

18:41.120 --> 18:42.246
This is fantastic.

18:42.830 --> 18:43.873
Yeah.

18:44.874 --> 18:47.460
Are you sure it's cool

18:44.874 --> 18:47.460
to have this fire in here?

18:47.501 --> 18:48.544
Oh yeah.

18:48.962 --> 18:50.463
But only because I'm an adult,

18:50.504 --> 18:52.506
and I'm supervising

18:50.504 --> 18:52.506
this activity.

18:53.007 --> 18:55.051
So you're saying that no kid

18:55.093 --> 18:57.553
should ever try this

18:55.093 --> 18:57.553
without adult supervision?

18:58.137 --> 18:59.138
Exactly.

19:00.598 --> 19:03.267
(laughs)

19:04.143 --> 19:06.312
So, you having a good time?

19:06.353 --> 19:07.772
Because, you know,

19:06.353 --> 19:07.772
this isn't exactly

19:07.814 --> 19:09.231
the weekend we planned.

19:09.816 --> 19:11.191
Are you two kidding me?

19:11.818 --> 19:12.693
This is amazing.

19:14.028 --> 19:16.280
You guys taught me how to ride

19:14.028 --> 19:16.280
and crash a bike.

19:17.615 --> 19:19.283
You showed me what riding

19:17.615 --> 19:19.283
a flume is like.

19:19.325 --> 19:20.743
We're camping.

19:21.119 --> 19:22.161
Yeah.

19:22.202 --> 19:23.537
And I bet we helped you forget

19:23.579 --> 19:25.081
that you never

19:23.579 --> 19:25.081
had a normal childhood.

19:25.123 --> 19:26.040
Yeah.

19:26.958 --> 19:27.834
Until you said that.

19:32.630 --> 19:33.297
Uh-oh.

19:33.339 --> 19:34.507
What's with the lights?

19:34.548 --> 19:36.216
The generators

19:34.548 --> 19:36.216
must be giving out.

19:37.135 --> 19:38.761
There might be a flashlight

19:37.135 --> 19:38.761
in that cabinet over there.

19:38.803 --> 19:39.720
I'll check.

19:50.023 --> 19:51.565
Hey, what's this?

19:52.025 --> 19:52.900
What do you got there?

19:53.567 --> 19:55.778
A clock with wires

19:53.567 --> 19:55.778
coming out of it.

19:56.195 --> 19:57.071
Let me see that.

20:00.366 --> 20:01.784
There's something

20:00.366 --> 20:01.784
written on the back.

20:02.535 --> 20:03.870
This is Schwoz's handwriting.

20:04.704 --> 20:06.580
"Lock down timer.

20:04.704 --> 20:06.580
Do not touch."

20:06.914 --> 20:08.248
Timer?

20:08.290 --> 20:09.792
You said the lock down

20:08.290 --> 20:09.792
was 48 hours.

20:09.834 --> 20:11.919
And that nothing

20:09.834 --> 20:11.919
could change that.

20:11.961 --> 20:14.881
Yeah, but if this clock is

20:11.961 --> 20:14.881
the timer for the lock down...

20:17.675 --> 20:18.759
Try moving the hands forward.

20:21.137 --> 20:22.221
(buzzing)

20:26.225 --> 20:30.270
(laughing)

20:31.022 --> 20:32.398
(elevator dings)

20:34.274 --> 20:35.484
The elevator works.

20:35.526 --> 20:36.569
So does my sprocket.

20:38.779 --> 20:41.074
Bye!

20:38.779 --> 20:41.074
Up the tube!

20:49.456 --> 20:53.836
I've never ever

20:49.456 --> 20:53.836
been this hungry.

20:54.712 --> 20:56.505
Why are they still up there?

20:56.547 --> 20:58.174
Can't they leave now

20:56.547 --> 20:58.174
since the lock down is over?

20:58.883 --> 21:00.676
Yeah, but I think

20:58.883 --> 21:00.676
they're delirious with hunger.

21:01.594 --> 21:03.179
- Okay, how about this?

21:03.429 --> 21:04.430
What?

21:04.805 --> 21:07.016
If you let me eat your thumb,

21:08.017 --> 21:09.393
I'll let you eat my thumb.

21:11.729 --> 21:12.646
Deal.

21:13.940 --> 21:14.857
Dear God.

21:16.025 --> 21:17.568
They're going

21:16.025 --> 21:17.568
to eat each others' thumbs.

21:17.610 --> 21:18.861
We better get up there.

21:18.903 --> 21:19.820
Let's blow and go.

21:20.446 --> 21:21.197
Oh yeah.

21:27.161 --> 21:29.247
Aah!

21:31.916 --> 21:33.292
Stop eating that thumb!

21:35.044 --> 21:36.670
It's Captain Man.

21:37.171 --> 21:39.132
And Kid Danger.

21:39.506 --> 21:40.883
Yes, we are.

21:50.059 --> 21:51.060
(Kid Danger)

21:50.059 --> 21:51.060
Why...

21:51.435 --> 21:53.229
Why are they looking

21:51.435 --> 21:53.229
at us like that?

21:54.396 --> 21:55.355
(Captain Man)

21:54.396 --> 21:55.355
I don't know.

21:58.067 --> 21:59.068
(Kid Danger)

21:58.067 --> 21:59.068
Why...

21:59.110 --> 22:00.694
Why are they coming toward us?

22:01.612 --> 22:03.405
I don't know,

22:01.612 --> 22:03.405
but they look hungry!

22:03.447 --> 22:04.406
Run!

22:34.228 --> 22:35.229
(bell oven dings)

22:34.228 --> 22:35.229
Mmm.
