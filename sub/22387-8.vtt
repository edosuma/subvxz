now, what I've got here is a few
decks of playing cards and I

02:29.250 --> 02:30.849
decks of playing cards and I
need one of these selected so we

need one of these selected so we
can do the trick.

02:31.652 --> 02:32.751
Can do the trick.
So I'll just ask somebody down

02:32.753 --> 02:33.418
so I'll just ask somebody down
here.

Perhaps the gentleman just here.

02:34.287 --> 02:35.153
Perhaps the gentleman just here.
Would you please choose one of

02:35.156 --> 02:37.256
would you please choose one of
these decks of cards?

02:38.292 --> 02:39.291

02:39.293 --> 02:39.758

Those.
You can check those later.

02:41.195 --> 02:41.894
You can check those later.
And that's just to prove there's

02:41.896 --> 02:43.295
and that's just to prove there's
no trick decks or special decks

02:43.297 --> 02:44.163
no trick decks or special decks
here.

02:44.165 --> 02:45.397
Here.
This is just a regular, ordinary

02:45.399 --> 02:46.498
this is just a regular, ordinary
deck of playing cards.

02:46.500 --> 02:47.733
Deck of playing cards.
When I have the cards selected

02:47.735 --> 02:48.934
when I have the cards selected
this evening, I'm gonna be

02:48.936 --> 02:50.569
this evening, I'm gonna be
doing this without touching the

02:50.571 --> 02:51.470
doing this without touching the
deck.

02:51.472 --> 02:52.704
Deck.
What's more, I'm gonna also be

02:52.706 --> 02:53.805
what's more, I'm gonna also be
doing the whole trick with my

02:53.807 --> 02:55.507
doing the whole trick with my
back turned to the audience so I

02:55.509 --> 02:57.242
back turned to the audience so I
can't see the deck or have any

02:57.244 --> 02:58.544
can't see the deck or have any
visual clue or clue from the

02:58.546 --> 03:00.212
visual clue or clue from the
audience as to what the card

03:00.214 --> 03:00.779
audience as to what the card
might be.

03:00.781 --> 03:01.647
Might be.
Now, I mentioned I'll be doing

03:01.649 --> 03:02.548
now, I mentioned I'll be doing
this with my back turned.

03:02.550 --> 03:03.515
This with my back turned.
There's a reason for this,

03:03.517 --> 03:04.950
there's a reason for this,
because I've had my back fitted

03:04.952 --> 03:06.785
because I've had my back fitted
with a very special stomach

03:06.787 --> 03:08.954
with a very special stomach
entering device that feeds the

03:08.956 --> 03:11.423
entering device that feeds the
cards directly into my stomach.

03:11.425 --> 03:12.524
Cards directly into my stomach.
Oh, yes, ladies and gentlemen,

03:12.526 --> 03:14.259
oh, yes, ladies and gentlemen,
it's amazing what you can get

03:14.261 --> 03:16.762
it's amazing what you can get
done in Thailand these days.

03:16.764 --> 03:17.629
Done in Thailand these days.
Now, the reason for that is

03:17.631 --> 03:19.398
now, the reason for that is
because over many years, I have

03:19.400 --> 03:22.201
because over many years, I have
developed a mind-reading

03:22.203 --> 03:25.204
developed a mind-reading
stomach.

03:25.206 --> 03:25.971
Stomach.
Now, I realize the viewers at

03:25.973 --> 03:27.339
now, I realize the viewers at
home may find the idea of a

03:27.341 --> 03:28.540
home may find the idea of a
mind-reading stomach a little

03:28.542 --> 03:31.843
mind-reading stomach a little
difficult to swallow, so let me

03:31.845 --> 03:32.744
difficult to swallow, so let me
explain what's gonna happen.

03:32.746 --> 03:33.946
Explain what's gonna happen.
Once the cards are inside my

03:33.948 --> 03:35.948
once the cards are inside my
stomach, I'm gonna be attempting

03:35.950 --> 03:36.949
stomach, I'm gonna be attempting
to read the mind of the

03:36.951 --> 03:38.584
to read the mind of the
volunteer who chose the card

03:38.586 --> 03:40.552
volunteer who chose the card
and regurgitate the card out

03:40.554 --> 03:42.287
and regurgitate the card out
through my stomach, up through

03:42.289 --> 03:43.755
through my stomach, up through
my esophagus and out through my

03:43.757 --> 03:44.690
my esophagus and out through my
mouth.

03:44.692 --> 03:46.725
Mouth.
Now, if that fails, I do have a

03:46.727 --> 03:48.727
now, if that fails, I do have a
contingency plan, but I'm really

03:48.729 --> 03:49.761
contingency plan, but I'm really
hoping we're not gonna have to

03:49.763 --> 03:50.862
hoping we're not gonna have to
go there this evening.

03:50.864 --> 03:52.564
Go there this evening.
It's a little messy, if you get

03:52.566 --> 03:53.332
it's a little messy, if you get
my drift.

03:53.334 --> 03:54.733
My drift.
So I need a volunteer to help me

03:54.735 --> 03:55.500
so I need a volunteer to help me
out with this.

03:55.502 --> 03:56.635
Out with this.
So we know it's somebody random,

03:56.637 --> 03:57.603
so we know it's somebody random,
could I ask penn and teller,

03:57.605 --> 03:58.670
could I ask penn and teller,
would you mind choosing a member

03:58.672 --> 03:59.905
would you mind choosing a member
of the audience from over this

03:59.907 --> 04:00.906
of the audience from over this
side?

04:00.908 --> 04:01.907
Side?
That's great.

04:01.909 --> 04:02.841
That's great.
>> Teller's taking it upon

04:02.843 --> 04:04.243
>> teller's taking it upon
himself to do the choosing.

04:04.245 --> 04:05.377
Himself to do the choosing.
>> Fantastic.

if I knew where the card was,

12:02.322 --> 12:03.188
if I knew where the card was,
I've no idea--

12:03.190 --> 12:04.155

There we go.
>> I think we all have the fear.

12:15.001 --> 12:16.167
>> I think we all have the fear.
So you find that I have no idea

12:16.169 --> 12:18.169
so you find that I have no idea
what card you're thinking of or

12:18.171 --> 12:19.804
what card you're thinking of or
where it is in the pack, so...

12:19.806 --> 12:21.206

12:29.082 --> 12:30.482
>> start slowly and quietly and
just build up faster and faster

12:30.484 --> 12:31.783
just build up faster and faster
and faster, and you can turn

12:31.785 --> 12:32.751
and faster, and you can turn
the volume up in your head.

12:32.753 --> 12:33.785
The volume up in your head.
Can you lift your chin up?

12:33.787 --> 12:34.252
Can you lift your chin up?

so try and keep an absolute
poker face when we do this.

12:42.462 --> 12:43.328
Poker face when we do this.
So you have a high card, so I

12:43.330 --> 12:44.896
so you have a high card, so I
reckon a court card, right?

12:44.898 --> 12:45.396

15:00.567 --> 15:02.100
is amazing, is--were you given
the choice to do this with

15:02.102 --> 15:02.751
the choice to do this with
someone in the audience instead

15:02.752 --> 15:03.401
someone in the audience instead
of us?

15:03.403 --> 15:04.269
Of us?
>> Yeah, I was.

15:04.271 --> 15:04.853
>> Yeah, I was.
>> You could have done it with

15:04.854 --> 15:05.436
>> you could have done it with
anybody here?

15:05.438 --> 15:06.304
Anybody here?
>> I could have done it with

15:06.306 --> 15:06.971
>> I could have done it with
anyone here.

15:06.973 --> 15:07.655
Anyone here.
>> And you chose to do it with

15:07.656 --> 15:08.338
>> and you chose to do it with
us?

15:08.341 --> 15:08.923
Us?
>> Yeah, I chose to do it with

15:08.924 --> 15:09.506
>> yeah, I chose to do it with
you.

15:09.509 --> 15:10.341
You.
>> Okay, you're gonna go very,

15:10.342 --> 15:11.174
>> okay, you're gonna go very,
very far.

15:11.177 --> 15:11.943
Very far.
[Laughter]

15:11.945 --> 15:14.012
[Laughter]
Because I think that if you had

15:14.014 --> 15:16.447
because I think that if you had
picked just about anyone else

15:16.449 --> 15:17.348
picked just about anyone else
in the audience who wasn't a

15:17.350 --> 15:18.549
in the audience who wasn't a
professional magician, you

15:18.551 --> 15:20.051
professional magician, you
would have gotten away with it

15:20.053 --> 15:21.352
would have gotten away with it
absolutely completely.

15:21.354 --> 15:24.489
Absolutely completely.
Now, I could tell you that we

15:24.491 --> 15:27.392
now, I could tell you that we
did, I believe, see every move

15:27.394 --> 15:29.460
did, I believe, see every move
you did, but only because we

15:29.462 --> 15:30.495
you did, but only because we
knew you were gonna do it

15:30.497 --> 15:32.964
knew you were gonna do it
before you did it, and also,

15:32.966 --> 15:35.166
before you did it, and also,
you know that there's a place I

15:35.168 --> 15:37.001
you know that there's a place I
could look right now on the

15:37.003 --> 15:38.703
could look right now on the
stage and on the set that would

15:38.705 --> 15:40.438
stage and on the set that would
probably give away part of the

15:40.440 --> 15:42.073
probably give away part of the
trick, and you don't want me to

15:42.075 --> 15:43.408
trick, and you don't want me to
do that and I don't want to do

15:43.410 --> 15:45.376
do that and I don't want to do
that, so why don't we just say,

15:45.378 --> 15:47.245
that, so why don't we just say,
you didn't quite fool us, but

15:47.247 --> 15:48.479
you didn't quite fool us, but
you fooled everyone else, and I

15:48.481 --> 15:49.480
you fooled everyone else, and I
doubt there's anyone at home

15:49.482 --> 15:50.381
doubt there's anyone at home
that even knew.

15:50.383 --> 15:51.516
That even knew.

Does doing it in the rubber

22:23.076 --> 22:23.741
does doing it in the rubber
help?

22:23.743 --> 22:25.409
Help?
Presumably, it means if the egg

22:25.411 --> 22:26.410
presumably, it means if the egg
does spill on you, you just wipe

22:26.412 --> 22:27.078
does spill on you, you just wipe
it clean, I guess that's

22:27.080 --> 22:27.745
it clean, I guess that's
something.

22:27.747 --> 22:28.746
Something.

and just to reassure you, I'm
not in on it.

22:39.058 --> 22:39.890
Not in on it.
I didn't know, I hadn't even

22:39.892 --> 22:40.758
I didn't know, I hadn't even
seen Laura's act earlier.

22:40.760 --> 22:41.792
Seen Laura's act earlier.
I wasn't allowed to be here on

22:41.794 --> 22:43.094
I wasn't allowed to be here on
this one, so I chose that lemon

22:43.096 --> 22:43.961
this one, so I chose that lemon
completely at random.

22:43.963 --> 22:45.563
Completely at random.
So I had no idea.

22:45.565 --> 22:46.530
So I had no idea.
Do you think they'll--they'll

22:46.532 --> 22:47.565
do you think they'll--they'll
rumble you?

22:47.567 --> 22:48.733
Rumble you?
>> It's a very, very old trick.

22:48.735 --> 22:49.734
>> It's a very, very old trick.
It's been around for a very long

22:49.736 --> 22:51.769
it's been around for a very long
time, so I think they'll 100%

22:51.771 --> 22:53.037
time, so I think they'll 100%
have seen the trick before, but

22:53.039 --> 22:54.638
have seen the trick before, but
I have got my own take on it.

22:54.640 --> 22:55.906
I have got my own take on it.
I mean, I use a lot of lemons

22:55.908 --> 22:56.907
I mean, I use a lot of lemons
mostly.

22:56.909 --> 22:57.575
Mostly.
[Laughter]

22:57.577 --> 22:59.410
[Laughter]
People just use one or two, so,

22:59.412 --> 23:00.378
people just use one or two, so,
you know, I don't know.

23:00.380 --> 23:00.845
You know, I don't know.
I guess--

23:00.847 --> 23:01.879
I guess--
>> so you think just the sheer

23:01.881 --> 23:02.980
>> so you think just the sheer
quantity of lemons might be

23:02.982 --> 23:03.981
quantity of lemons might be
enough to fool them.

23:03.983 --> 23:05.816
Enough to fool them.

sleeves or pull them out of your
sleeves.

23:26.939 --> 23:29.106
Sleeves.
It makes everything much more

23:29.108 --> 23:29.907

difficult.

23:29.909 --> 23:32.843
Difficult.

or herself who checks the final
turnbuckles, so it was clearly

38:35.547 --> 38:37.947
turnbuckles, so it was clearly
