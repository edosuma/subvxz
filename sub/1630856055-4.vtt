WEBVTT

00:16.600 --> 00:19.500
Right now we're
working at the money pit.

00:19.500 --> 00:22.133
This is some deep ground here,
about double

00:22.133 --> 00:25.734
from what we were working
last year on the Indian River.

00:25.734 --> 00:27.867
Parker is gonna be spending
a lot of money

00:27.867 --> 00:30.500
before we ever get
an ounce of gold out of here.

00:31.900 --> 00:33.433
Yeah, man.
Well, I can't imagine

00:33.433 --> 00:35.166
the pressure he's under,
you know,

00:35.166 --> 00:37.500
going from having
all that money in the bank

00:38.266 --> 00:40.467
to next day having
a big 'ol debt

00:40.467 --> 00:42.500
and long time till we start
seeing any gold

00:42.500 --> 00:44.734
to help pay it off.

00:44.734 --> 00:47.400
You know, going broke
has to be in the back
of all of our minds.

00:51.767 --> 00:54.433
Parker Schnabel
is risking everything

00:54.433 --> 00:57.000
to build an empire
in the Klondike.

00:57.000 --> 00:59.300
At just 28-years-old,

00:59.300 --> 01:02.400
he's leveraged
everything he has to buy

01:02.400 --> 01:06.266
the $15 million Dominion
Creek claim.

01:06.266 --> 01:08.900
It has been an outrageously
expensive spring

01:08.900 --> 01:11.867
but that is an understatement.

01:11.867 --> 01:13.700
We've already spent more this
year than we've ever spent

01:13.700 --> 01:15.533
in this season,

01:15.533 --> 01:17.900
and we haven't
even started really.

01:17.900 --> 01:20.066
If Parker's
spending spree puts him

01:20.066 --> 01:23.700
on the gold,
Dominion could pay out big,

01:23.700 --> 01:26.200
up to 80,000 ounces,

01:26.200 --> 01:29.934
worth $160 million.

01:30.934 --> 01:33.800
Looks like a really
good block of ground, but,

01:33.800 --> 01:35.934
you know,
it's a bit of a beast.

01:37.066 --> 01:39.033
A month into the season,

01:39.033 --> 01:42.900
Parker's facing the most
critical time for a miner.

01:42.900 --> 01:45.600
He's spending hundreds
of thousands each week

01:45.600 --> 01:48.000
to strip down
to the pay layer,

01:48.000 --> 01:50.400
but no money is coming in.

01:50.400 --> 01:52.000
At this pace,

01:52.000 --> 01:55.066
he could go broke
in just six weeks.

01:56.767 --> 01:58.400
And probably
still like

01:58.400 --> 02:00.767
15 feet to bedrock,
it looks like.

02:00.767 --> 02:05.100
And that means there's 10 feet
to thaw, and a foot a week
is 10 weeks.

02:05.100 --> 02:08.767
Two and a half months
and we'll be able
to sluice here.

02:08.767 --> 02:11.934
It's just super frustrating
having this much ground

02:11.934 --> 02:13.734
and so much gold in it,

02:13.734 --> 02:16.667
and for the problems we're
facing right now financially,

02:16.667 --> 02:19.100
it may as well
just not even exist.

02:19.100 --> 02:20.600
But it's like...

02:24.867 --> 02:27.066
Yeah, I think the only way
we can kinda...

02:28.000 --> 02:31.000
get over this hump
is to get a plant going,

02:31.000 --> 02:32.900
we're gonna make it sluice
a bunch of tailings

02:32.900 --> 02:34.066
and see
if there's any gold in it.

02:35.800 --> 02:38.967
Parker's Dominion
Creek claim includes a slew

02:38.967 --> 02:42.000
of old cuts worked
by old timers,

02:42.000 --> 02:46.367
going all the way back
to the Gold Rush of 1896.

02:47.266 --> 02:49.600
Their mining equipment
was less efficient

02:49.600 --> 02:51.900
at cleaning pay-dirt,
leaving lots

02:51.900 --> 02:54.634
of gold behind
in the waste tailings.

03:04.467 --> 03:06.867
Right there is fine.

03:06.867 --> 03:08.934
Parker has found old tailings

03:08.934 --> 03:10.734
near Gold Run Creek

03:10.734 --> 03:14.066
that he thinks could bring in
some quick money.

03:14.066 --> 03:17.367
That is Gold Run,
which was a super-rich creek.

03:17.367 --> 03:19.066
And where it dumped
into Dominion,

03:19.066 --> 03:23.533
I'm guessing was, you know,
in this area right here.

03:23.533 --> 03:26.333
I think there's gonna be
a bunch of gold
in the tailings.

03:26.333 --> 03:29.667
If there is, it's great
because there's no stripping,

03:29.667 --> 03:30.867
they're thawed

03:30.867 --> 03:33.367
and we need to get some money

03:33.367 --> 03:35.800
coming in because we're gonna
be broke very soon.

03:37.734 --> 03:39.734
Parker is going
to run a test yard

03:39.734 --> 03:41.500
of tailings through
a mini trommel

03:41.500 --> 03:43.800
to see if there's
enough gold.

03:45.266 --> 03:47.567
So if we run a yard,
we need to get...

03:48.600 --> 03:50.934
155 milligrams.

03:50.934 --> 03:52.033
Forty buckets?

03:52.033 --> 03:53.333
Forty buckets.

04:01.567 --> 04:03.033
Is that bucket seven?

04:03.533 --> 04:04.567
There's seven.

04:04.567 --> 04:05.934
Holy cow.

04:05.934 --> 04:07.200
We're flying.

04:08.834 --> 04:11.900
So, all these tailings
were mined in the '80s

04:11.900 --> 04:14.734
- with an old push box.
- Really?

04:14.734 --> 04:16.900
You weren't even born
in the '80s, were you?

04:17.867 --> 04:19.967
And you were only like 65.

04:20.634 --> 04:21.700
Yeah.

04:24.734 --> 04:26.300
Is that 39?

04:26.300 --> 04:27.367
Thirty-nine.

04:28.266 --> 04:29.734
- One more?
- One more after this.

04:32.100 --> 04:34.433
- Last one?
- Last one.

04:36.500 --> 04:37.700
Last one.

04:38.700 --> 04:40.734
See anything in there?

04:40.734 --> 04:42.967
It'll probably
be tiny, whatever it is.

04:42.967 --> 04:44.834
Well, we'll get it
back and go through it, huh?

04:44.834 --> 04:46.367
Yeah.

04:46.367 --> 04:47.500
Do it properly.

04:50.100 --> 04:52.967
We're gonna go pan her down,
weigh it up,

04:52.967 --> 04:54.100
see what we've got.

04:58.967 --> 05:01.367
I bet its 240 milligrams.

05:01.967 --> 05:03.667
I'll go 190.

05:04.900 --> 05:07.934
226 for a shot of whiskey.

05:07.934 --> 05:10.934
Shot of whiskey,
226, 240, 190.

05:10.934 --> 05:12.133
190.

05:12.133 --> 05:13.867
I'm always a positive guy.

05:26.433 --> 05:29.033
So 300 would be ideal

05:29.033 --> 05:32.433
but, you know,
beggars can't be choosers.

05:32.433 --> 05:34.333
To make it worth sluicing,

05:34.333 --> 05:36.233
Parker needs the one yard test

05:36.233 --> 05:41.233
to deliver at least
155 milligrams of gold.

05:51.367 --> 05:52.734
54.

05:55.367 --> 05:57.133
That means it sucks.

05:57.133 --> 05:58.433
All right.

05:58.433 --> 05:59.734
Old baggie?

06:00.467 --> 06:01.500
Are they in here?

06:01.500 --> 06:03.233
Yeah, just a few in there.

06:04.100 --> 06:05.567
Its so annoying.

06:07.367 --> 06:09.500
Overall, it's very lean.

06:09.500 --> 06:11.600
Um, I've gotta talk
to the guys about it

06:11.600 --> 06:13.033
and figure out
what we're gonna do.

06:39.934 --> 06:41.500
10 miles away,

06:41.500 --> 06:43.133
King of the Klondike,

06:43.133 --> 06:46.500
Tony Beets has the same
problem as Parker,

06:46.500 --> 06:49.033
no gold coming in.

06:49.033 --> 06:52.266
After three weeks stripping
at Paradise Hill,

06:52.266 --> 06:54.900
Tony put that operation
on hold

06:54.900 --> 06:58.333
and is returning
to his Indian River claims

06:58.333 --> 07:00.266
for a quick score.

07:08.066 --> 07:10.300
The ground
is some of the best

07:10.300 --> 07:11.834
Tony's ever mined,

07:11.834 --> 07:15.133
bringing in more than
$13 million

07:15.133 --> 07:18.066
with more sitting right
on the surface.

07:27.533 --> 07:30.100
Without needing
to strip the ground,

07:30.100 --> 07:34.133
Tony is also saving hundreds
of thousands of dollars.

07:43.033 --> 07:45.166
Before he can take advantage

07:45.166 --> 07:47.567
of these near
perfect conditions,

07:47.567 --> 07:51.367
Tony first needs
to get his gear to the cuts.

07:58.166 --> 07:59.767
We seem to be missing something.

08:08.500 --> 08:09.900
Yeah.

08:12.333 --> 08:14.700
No one was here to keep an eye
on anything either.

08:21.734 --> 08:22.800
Yeah.

08:27.634 --> 08:29.567
Well, it would've been nice.

08:35.233 --> 08:38.567
Tony's pre-stripped
cuts lie on the other side

08:38.567 --> 08:41.734
of a small creek
that runs through his claim,

08:41.734 --> 08:44.867
but the bridge across it
has collapsed.

08:44.867 --> 08:49.066
Tony's plan,
remove the old broken bridge,

08:49.066 --> 08:52.400
then bring in
a 20-foot long culvert

08:52.400 --> 08:55.166
and cover it with tailings
to build up a road

08:55.166 --> 08:58.100
across the creek
and allow his equipment

08:58.100 --> 09:00.100
to access the cuts.

09:07.567 --> 09:09.600
A good road is worth
its weight in gold.

09:09.600 --> 09:13.700
They'll save time, money, and
just generally a big headache.

09:13.700 --> 09:15.934
No road, no gold.

10:28.767 --> 10:31.600
I know, but once it start
walking back, it's gonna jerk.

10:52.000 --> 10:54.200
You're doing a jig over there?

11:22.667 --> 11:24.734
The flow
of the creek is increasing

11:24.734 --> 11:26.900
due to melting snow.

11:26.900 --> 11:30.634
The clock is ticking
to get the culvert in.

12:16.900 --> 12:17.767
Yeah.

12:20.667 --> 12:23.567
To optimize
water flow under the road,

12:23.567 --> 12:26.066
the 20 foot by 6 foot culvert

12:26.066 --> 12:28.500
must lie in the center
of the creek.

13:11.133 --> 13:12.834
I need to fill this in
'cause otherwise,

13:12.834 --> 13:15.200
that water is gonna wash away
the culvert.

13:17.834 --> 13:20.867
To stop the water
washing away the culvert,

13:20.867 --> 13:25.467
Mike races
to build up the road
and secure it in place.

13:26.834 --> 13:28.800
So you wanna get there
and quick 'cause the longer
you wait,

13:28.800 --> 13:30.533
the more work
you have to do to fix it.

13:30.533 --> 13:31.700
And if you wait too long,

13:31.700 --> 13:32.700
you have to start literally

13:32.700 --> 13:34.033
from the beginning again.

13:35.734 --> 13:38.100
Well, work you piece
of [bleep].

13:50.200 --> 13:52.367
Yeah.

13:53.867 --> 13:56.266
Now I'm [bleep] drenched.

13:56.266 --> 13:59.200
To access
his cuts at Indian River,

13:59.200 --> 14:00.867
Tony Beets is racing

14:00.867 --> 14:02.900
to build a road
across a creek

14:02.900 --> 14:06.367
before melt water
washes the culvert away.

14:39.266 --> 14:42.200
Using waste material
from the rock trucks,

14:42.200 --> 14:45.133
Mike builds up the road
around the culvert.

14:45.133 --> 14:46.800
This will give me enough dirt

14:46.800 --> 14:49.433
so that we have a two-lane
road here once again.

15:20.734 --> 15:23.734
- Hey, Morgan, you got a copy?
- Yeah, go ahead, Rick.

15:23.734 --> 15:25.166
How low is that pay pile
getting us?

15:25.166 --> 15:26.734
It's getting pretty bad, right?

15:26.734 --> 15:28.467
Yeah, I'm getting pretty low.

15:28.467 --> 15:30.433
That second pile to you right
way over by the other...

15:30.433 --> 15:32.066
By the other trailers?

15:32.066 --> 15:33.867
Yeah, I see it way over there.

15:33.867 --> 15:36.533
Yeah, if you take two quick
scoops from the pile we're on,

15:36.533 --> 15:37.934
dump them in the feeder,

15:37.934 --> 15:39.533
and then haul ass over
to that other...

15:39.533 --> 15:41.133
That far pile
and grab one scoop.

15:41.133 --> 15:43.266
You should be able to get back
in time to like,

15:43.266 --> 15:44.800
you know, dump it
in the hopper before it,

15:44.800 --> 15:46.166
you know, clears out.

15:46.734 --> 15:49.000
All right. Sounds good.

15:49.000 --> 15:52.333
125 miles from Dawson City,

15:52.333 --> 15:56.166
Rick Ness
is on a comeback mission.

15:56.166 --> 15:59.367
After failing to mine
at all last year

15:59.367 --> 16:01.133
and nearly losing everything,

16:01.767 --> 16:04.100
he's rebuilding from scratch.

16:05.000 --> 16:06.900
I've got a lot
on the line this year.

16:06.900 --> 16:10.533
There's just Morgan and I
right now, but I feel great.

16:10.533 --> 16:13.433
Yeah, I mean I feel like
I've got that old energy back.

16:13.433 --> 16:15.266
So we're gonna win as much
as we can this year, so...

16:16.300 --> 16:17.800
To fund his season,

16:17.800 --> 16:19.533
Rick's been running pay dirt

16:19.533 --> 16:22.500
from the first
of two old pay piles.

16:23.400 --> 16:27.233
So far,
he's brought in 42 ounces

16:27.233 --> 16:30.667
worth just over $84,000.

16:32.000 --> 16:33.400
To keep going,

16:33.400 --> 16:35.233
he needs to bring in at least

16:35.233 --> 16:38.467
another 20 ounces this week.

16:38.467 --> 16:40.700
The good news
is we've got gold coming in,

16:40.700 --> 16:42.634
but really, at this point
the pay pile

16:42.634 --> 16:45.400
is not gonna last
much more than a week.

16:45.400 --> 16:48.033
We got another stockpile
but it's quite a ways away.

16:48.033 --> 16:50.900
You know, we've been having
to shut down the plant

16:50.900 --> 16:54.667
just so we can move
the pay dirt out of the pile
over here.

16:54.667 --> 16:57.467
Its close enough for
a haul truck to make it easy,

16:57.467 --> 17:00.233
but we don't have
a haul truck running.

17:00.233 --> 17:02.667
We only have a loader
and an excavator.

17:02.667 --> 17:04.467
During his down year,

17:04.467 --> 17:08.000
the rental company took
back most of Rick's gear,

17:08.000 --> 17:11.934
leaving him with only
a few pieces of machinery.

17:11.934 --> 17:14.166
Right now, we really need
a rock truck but the only...

17:14.166 --> 17:15.767
The only one we got
is [bleep] ancient.

17:17.834 --> 17:20.600
And I sure as hell
don't have time to fix it.

17:21.600 --> 17:23.166
I got a guy coming.

17:23.166 --> 17:24.567
I don't really know
anything about him,

17:24.567 --> 17:25.900
but I'm hoping
he can help us out.

17:40.433 --> 17:42.300
- How's it going?
- Not bad. Yourself?

17:42.300 --> 17:43.734
Good. I'm Rick.

17:43.734 --> 17:45.000
Nice. I'm Buzz.

17:45.000 --> 17:46.233
Buzz, nice to meet you.

17:46.233 --> 17:47.934
I'm glad you stopped by today.

17:47.934 --> 17:49.734
Ran into a spot here where,
you know,

17:49.734 --> 17:51.333
- we're running out of options.
- Yeah.

17:51.333 --> 17:53.133
As you can see, there's just
two of us running around

17:53.133 --> 17:54.734
like idiots with our heads
chopped off, so...

17:56.667 --> 17:57.767
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

17:57.767 --> 17:59.033
The way we're doing things
right now,

17:59.033 --> 18:00.467
- it's slow.
- Yeah.

18:00.467 --> 18:02.667
You know what I mean?
And we're just go, go, go, go,

18:02.667 --> 18:04.834
um, but you know, we sure as
hell could use a rock truck.

18:04.834 --> 18:07.367
If you could get that thing
running for us,
that'd be a big help.

18:07.367 --> 18:08.800
I got my coveralls
in the truck.

18:09.867 --> 18:11.066
I can go through it.

18:11.066 --> 18:13.066
Check it out and see
if we can get it going.

18:13.066 --> 18:14.233
I'd say
if you'll get it running,

18:14.233 --> 18:15.300
you probably got a job here.

18:16.600 --> 18:18.567
- Sounds good, man.
- All right.

18:18.567 --> 18:20.467
- Well, good luck, Buzz.
All right.
- I'll make it happen.

18:22.500 --> 18:24.433
If Buzz can get
that truck running, you know,

18:24.433 --> 18:26.634
that's gonna get the plant
back running full time for us,

18:26.634 --> 18:28.433
then we won't have to shut
the plant down

18:28.433 --> 18:30.266
just to go get pay out
of the pay pile.

18:30.266 --> 18:31.934
So I'm hoping he
comes through.

18:31.934 --> 18:33.100
That'd be great.

18:34.033 --> 18:35.634
Usually, because it's...

18:35.634 --> 18:37.066
because it's been sitting
so long

18:37.066 --> 18:38.233
it'd be like dead batteries,

18:39.533 --> 18:40.834
flat tires,

18:40.834 --> 18:42.734
no antifreeze.

18:44.000 --> 18:46.333
Hopefully, this all works out.

18:46.333 --> 18:49.800
Buzz Legault worked
with mine boss Fred Lewis

18:49.800 --> 18:51.800
for the last two seasons.

18:53.300 --> 18:55.567
Working with Fred
was good experience

18:55.567 --> 18:57.166
and everything, but...

18:59.200 --> 19:02.333
I just told Fred
I had to move on.

19:02.333 --> 19:03.967
It kinda sucks.

19:03.967 --> 19:05.767
I like working with the guy
and I like the guy.

19:05.767 --> 19:12.367
He's a good guy, but just
can't keep on chasing my tail.

19:12.367 --> 19:14.133
I got my own future
to think about.

19:14.133 --> 19:16.266
I got a family
to take care of.

19:16.266 --> 19:19.367
Make a brighter future
for ourselves, so...

19:20.734 --> 19:24.233
Rick's rock truck
is nearly 40-years-old

19:24.233 --> 19:29.767
and the 33-ton relic
hasn't hauled dirt for years.

19:29.767 --> 19:31.700
It gets pretty cold
here in the Yukon

19:31.700 --> 19:33.000
in winters sometime.

19:33.000 --> 19:35.266
Batteries tend to freeze.

19:35.266 --> 19:37.600
There we go,
it goes right back up.

19:37.600 --> 19:38.667
Well, that's good.

19:39.300 --> 19:40.433
Good power.

19:40.433 --> 19:43.200
Turn on this freaking night
switch here

19:43.200 --> 19:45.834
and see
if we can make contact.

19:49.433 --> 19:50.500
Huh...

19:54.467 --> 19:55.533
nothing.

19:56.467 --> 19:57.734
What the hell?

19:57.734 --> 19:59.467
No freaking power.

19:59.467 --> 20:02.500
I didn't check the wires
of this freaking started.

20:07.967 --> 20:09.700
So the wires are going.

20:09.700 --> 20:12.567
It's still freaking all
hooked up to the alternator.

20:12.567 --> 20:15.800
Oh, everything looks
pretty freaking good.

20:16.433 --> 20:18.634
Everything is connected.

20:21.467 --> 20:25.867
Gonna go check
the wires on the other side.

20:28.266 --> 20:30.066
There's a ground cable.

20:30.066 --> 20:32.467
Oh, [bleep] look at that.

20:32.467 --> 20:34.867
ground cable is off.

20:34.867 --> 20:37.433
Looks like we might have found
the problem here,

20:37.433 --> 20:39.634
'cause the night switch
is tied in

20:39.634 --> 20:42.433
to your ground cable
so that you can disconnect
your batteries,

20:42.433 --> 20:44.800
so that you're not draining
your batteries

20:44.800 --> 20:46.734
when the vehicle
isn't running.

20:46.734 --> 20:51.266
Just as long as this thing is
the right thread, perfect fit.

20:52.900 --> 20:55.133
Yeah, providing this
is the only problem,

20:55.133 --> 20:57.667
this is a frickin' easy
fix here.

20:59.333 --> 21:01.734
give her a shot.

21:04.266 --> 21:06.333
Fingers crossed this works.

21:09.033 --> 21:11.100
Definitely got contact.

21:21.533 --> 21:23.700
We need to fill up
the air pressure.

21:23.700 --> 21:27.233
It'll warm up a little bit,
make it... Run it over there.

21:27.233 --> 21:30.233
It's a pretty
easy way to get a job

21:30.233 --> 21:32.033
for the summer.

21:50.133 --> 21:51.567
Something [bleep] wrong.

21:52.667 --> 21:55.600
The damn thing stopped moving.

21:56.200 --> 21:57.967
No power to the wheels.

21:59.934 --> 22:02.333
I just hope
it's not the transmission.

22:06.266 --> 22:09.100
Oh, [bleep] universe.

22:09.100 --> 22:10.867
The joint let go.

22:10.867 --> 22:13.266
The joint
that holds the drive shaft

22:13.266 --> 22:14.967
has shorn off.

22:14.967 --> 22:18.900
If Buzz can't fix it,
he'll be out of a job.

22:18.900 --> 22:22.500
[bleep] I just
finished fixing this thing,

22:22.500 --> 22:23.834
now I gotta fix it again.

22:32.567 --> 22:35.333
That drive shaft is not
connected to the transmission,

22:35.333 --> 22:38.767
which doesn't... Means it's
not connected to the rear end.

22:38.767 --> 22:41.300
It won't move.
So we'll have to fix that.

22:41.300 --> 22:43.500
We need to put it back
together if we get the parts.

22:43.500 --> 22:44.867
Hopefully we do.

22:44.867 --> 22:47.133
To secure himself a job,

22:47.133 --> 22:51.934
Buzz Legault needs to get
Rick's only rock truck
up and running,

22:51.934 --> 22:55.400
but the drive shaft
has shorn of.

22:55.400 --> 22:57.900
To tackle the two man job...

22:57.900 --> 23:00.133
Have a look
and see what we can find.

23:00.133 --> 23:03.800
...Buzz has called in
help from the camp's cook.

23:03.800 --> 23:07.066
Oh,
these are busted U-bolts.

23:07.066 --> 23:09.133
They hold the drive shaft in

23:09.133 --> 23:11.800
which takes the power
from the motor to the tires

23:11.800 --> 23:15.233
and so we got no power
to the tires right now.

23:20.834 --> 23:22.767
Yeah, she's [bleep].

23:22.767 --> 23:24.634
Yeah, they sheared
the bolts straight off.

23:26.233 --> 23:28.233
Freaking pull the rest
of that drive shaft out

23:28.233 --> 23:29.634
- if we can.
- All right.

23:29.634 --> 23:30.834
- Well...
- Let's see.

23:30.834 --> 23:33.066
I'm here to help you
out so let's get it done.

23:33.066 --> 23:34.533
- Yeah.
- All right.

23:35.500 --> 23:36.667
There you go.

23:42.667 --> 23:45.233
Sheared the bolts
right off inside there.

23:47.100 --> 23:48.967
The rock truck's drive shaft

23:48.967 --> 23:51.300
transfers power
from the engine

23:51.300 --> 23:53.333
to its two rear wheels,

23:53.333 --> 23:56.767
but two of the four U-bolts
that keep it in place

23:56.767 --> 23:58.567
have sheared off

23:58.567 --> 24:01.834
and the drive shaft
has fallen out of alignment,

24:01.834 --> 24:04.500
stopping it from working.

24:04.500 --> 24:08.066
To fix the problem,
Buzz must put the shaft back

24:08.934 --> 24:12.100
then replace
the broken bolts,

24:12.100 --> 24:15.734
allowing the drive shaft
to power the rear wheels.

24:22.500 --> 24:24.800
Oh [bleep].

24:24.800 --> 24:28.600
It looks like now
we've got one that's

24:28.600 --> 24:31.567
wrong bolt in the wrong
hole so it's [bleep].

24:35.734 --> 24:37.567
This is the factory bolt

24:37.567 --> 24:41.233
and this is the one whoever
installed the part put in,

24:41.233 --> 24:43.000
which is a different
thread pattern

24:43.000 --> 24:44.133
and a little bit
bigger of a bolt.

24:44.133 --> 24:46.467
So it just squished
the threads on the inside.

24:47.533 --> 24:48.867
So what Buzz
is doing right now

24:48.867 --> 24:50.934
is just rethreading
the inside hole,

24:50.934 --> 24:53.767
so we'll be able to put
the factory bolts back in.

24:53.767 --> 24:55.233
Really sucks
when you got to wait

24:55.233 --> 24:56.834
a couple hours
to do a freaking

24:56.834 --> 24:58.500
couple minutes' worth of work.

25:00.133 --> 25:01.300
This would've been
avoided if the guy

25:01.300 --> 25:03.567
put the right freaking
bolt in the hole.

25:03.567 --> 25:05.533
Feels like it's working.

25:05.533 --> 25:07.300
All right, Buzz.
You ready for this?

25:07.300 --> 25:09.400
- Yes, sir!
- All right. Let's go.

25:28.834 --> 25:30.800
Yeah, we're just
tightening up the bolts

25:30.800 --> 25:32.400
and then we're gonna
torque them down

25:32.400 --> 25:34.433
and we should be done.

25:34.433 --> 25:35.567
Hopefully.

25:45.333 --> 25:46.700
Let 'er rip.

25:46.700 --> 25:47.967
Take it for

25:47.967 --> 25:49.600
- a tour.
- Yeah.

26:15.367 --> 26:16.266
Hey, Rick.

26:17.400 --> 26:18.533
Glad to see you there.

26:18.533 --> 26:19.900
Shut [bleep].

26:23.200 --> 26:24.634
Look at this [bleep] guy.

26:39.834 --> 26:40.800
She's a runner.

26:40.800 --> 26:41.934
[bleep] yeah.

26:41.934 --> 26:43.100
What was wrong with it?

26:43.734 --> 26:45.900
Lots?

26:45.900 --> 26:47.100
I don't wanna know.

26:47.867 --> 26:49.934
Good job, though.
Holy [bleep] man.

26:49.934 --> 26:50.934
That's gonna help out
big time.

26:50.934 --> 26:53.333
- Yeah.
- How do you feel
about running it now?

26:53.333 --> 26:54.734
No problem, man.

26:54.734 --> 26:56.433
Get back in that thing.
I'll load you up.

26:57.834 --> 26:58.867
awesome.

26:58.867 --> 26:59.900
You know, that's the first
thing I asked him to do.

26:59.900 --> 27:01.200
He nailed it.

27:01.200 --> 27:03.900
Oh, we just finished
the last of the stockpile.

27:03.900 --> 27:05.600
Rock truck
up and running,

27:05.600 --> 27:07.800
Buzz can start
hauling pay dirt,

27:07.800 --> 27:10.734
keeping Rick on the gold.

27:10.734 --> 27:12.667
He can obviously run
all the equipment out here,

27:12.667 --> 27:13.867
you know,
he is thinking on his feet.

27:13.867 --> 27:16.066
He's looking ahead.
He's able to solve problems.

27:16.066 --> 27:18.133
It sounds like the kind of guy
I'd like to have on my team.

27:18.133 --> 27:19.367
So I'm gonna give him a shot.

27:35.400 --> 27:37.066
Too much money
has gone out the door

27:37.066 --> 27:38.834
and didly-squat's come in,

27:38.834 --> 27:41.400
and it's not good when
checks start bouncing.

27:41.400 --> 27:43.767
After failing to find gold

27:43.767 --> 27:47.033
in the old timer tailings
worth running,

27:47.033 --> 27:49.300
Parker's come up
with a new plan

27:49.300 --> 27:52.300
to bring in his
first gold this season.

27:52.300 --> 27:53.734
We're gonna have to come
down here to Ken and Stuart's.

27:53.734 --> 27:56.333
Here to get a plant going
and get some money coming in.

27:58.734 --> 28:01.300
10 miles
southwest of Dominion,

28:01.300 --> 28:04.066
Parker has 2,000 acres
of ground

28:04.066 --> 28:06.867
leased from landlord's
Ken Tatlow

28:06.867 --> 28:08.800
and Stuart Schmidt,

28:08.800 --> 28:12.233
which he hopes will be
a smash and grab job.

28:12.233 --> 28:13.700
In this piece right here,

28:13.700 --> 28:16.100
like we stripped it and we've
never even sluiced it,

28:16.100 --> 28:18.100
and so there's a big
chunk in here that...

28:18.100 --> 28:20.233
that's ready to go.

28:20.233 --> 28:23.033
To get the gold
he needs to stay afloat,

28:23.033 --> 28:26.533
Parker will have
to spend even more.

28:26.533 --> 28:29.567
He's on a razor's edge.

28:29.567 --> 28:30.500
It's...

28:31.367 --> 28:32.667
not ideal.

28:32.667 --> 28:34.367
We're spending a lot of money

28:34.367 --> 28:37.834
and we may be in a little bit
of trouble at some point.

28:39.300 --> 28:41.800
Right now we're just
getting the 480 loaded up here

28:42.800 --> 28:44.467
heading down to Ken's.

28:44.467 --> 28:47.367
To kick start
his second operation,

28:47.367 --> 28:50.367
he's brought in
foreman Mitch Blaschke

28:50.367 --> 28:53.700
and plant boss Tyson Lee.

28:53.700 --> 28:56.266
Get equipment down there,
get a water pump down there.

28:56.266 --> 28:58.834
Got a game plan now,
so then we just have

28:58.834 --> 29:01.166
to execute
and start moving dirt.

29:08.467 --> 29:09.333
Damn.

29:11.100 --> 29:12.300
Now I've got a pond.

29:18.667 --> 29:19.700
Oh yeah.

29:19.700 --> 29:22.867
So this area used to retain
a little bit of water

29:22.867 --> 29:25.000
but that's, uh,
that's a lot of water.

29:26.867 --> 29:29.333
The only road
to Ken and Stuart's

29:29.333 --> 29:30.533
is flooded.

29:31.667 --> 29:34.867
Tyson is gonna bounce
the 480 off the semi.

29:34.867 --> 29:35.934
If you're trying to beat rigs

29:35.934 --> 29:37.767
through two feet
of water every day,

29:37.767 --> 29:40.400
we're gonna be mechanics
instead of gold miners.

29:41.233 --> 29:42.667
Tyson, you got a copy?

29:43.400 --> 29:45.567
Yo, Tyson, you got a copy?

29:45.567 --> 29:47.233
Go ahead.

29:47.233 --> 29:50.967
Hey man, I'll just get
the semi across this,

29:50.967 --> 29:52.667
and then we'll just
load you on the other side

29:52.667 --> 29:53.734
'cause it might
be a little soft.

29:53.734 --> 29:56.400
I don't wanna get hung up
in the middle of it.

29:56.400 --> 29:57.934
Sounds good, man.

30:06.266 --> 30:08.000
Get this out of the way.

30:21.000 --> 30:22.300
Oh, baby.

30:23.467 --> 30:25.000
She is deep.

30:28.567 --> 30:30.266
Bring your life jacket
with you?

30:32.734 --> 30:34.266
Yeah, there's some mud
right here

30:34.266 --> 30:35.867
at this side
that's sloughed in there.

30:35.867 --> 30:38.266
That's why she's
not draining, so, yeah,

30:38.266 --> 30:40.133
do you wanna dig that out?

30:40.133 --> 30:41.500
Copy, copy.

30:47.066 --> 30:48.967
I might actually have
to get down in there,

30:48.967 --> 30:51.367
Mitch, and try and dig it out.

30:53.834 --> 30:56.467
The road
drainage ditch is blocked,

30:56.467 --> 30:58.200
causing water to back up

30:58.200 --> 30:59.800
and spill over.

30:59.800 --> 31:02.367
Now, Tyson needs to clear it.

31:23.100 --> 31:24.400
Gotta be kidding me.

31:34.734 --> 31:36.333
This thing is [bleep].

31:41.100 --> 31:42.400
Damn it.

31:42.400 --> 31:43.934
This track is [bleep].

31:45.300 --> 31:47.100
Yeah, I should've knocked
that [bleep] out

31:47.100 --> 31:48.934
and flattened her out
a bit before rodeoing

31:48.934 --> 31:50.433
over it like that.

31:50.433 --> 31:52.000
Get her up here where
she's high and dry

31:52.000 --> 31:54.500
and we'll have
to back that idler off.

31:55.700 --> 31:58.500
On a mission
to start sluicing ground

31:58.500 --> 32:01.700
at Ken and Stuart's,
Tyson's attempt to unblock

32:01.700 --> 32:05.600
the flooded drainage ditch
has come to a halt.

32:05.600 --> 32:07.467
You can see,
when Tyson when through here,

32:07.467 --> 32:09.233
it's real steep on the side,
so the tracks

32:09.233 --> 32:10.767
were able to kinda walk up,

32:10.767 --> 32:12.500
and it just allowed it
to walk right off

32:12.500 --> 32:13.800
the end of the idler there.

32:15.967 --> 32:18.266
So this is our
track chain right here

32:18.266 --> 32:20.333
and it's supposed
to be right on the top

32:20.333 --> 32:22.100
of this front idler.

32:22.100 --> 32:24.100
And as you can see,
it's popped to the inside.

32:24.100 --> 32:25.567
So what we need to do here

32:25.567 --> 32:27.367
is relieve the pressure on it,

32:27.367 --> 32:30.867
back this off, and then
walk the track back on,

32:30.867 --> 32:31.934
and tighten things back up.

32:31.934 --> 32:34.300
What we may need to do here
is grab the loader...

32:34.300 --> 32:35.734
And push on that side?

32:35.734 --> 32:37.767
Well, we just need to hook
a chain on it here.

32:37.767 --> 32:39.200
We'll get the slack
up around the top

32:39.200 --> 32:41.100
and we'll kinda pull
back a little bit.

32:41.100 --> 32:42.800
Let's see if we can
get it to slip over.

32:54.400 --> 32:56.133
All righty. All set.

32:56.133 --> 32:57.100
All right, buddy.

32:57.100 --> 32:59.600
Give me a little bit
of pressure over here.

32:59.600 --> 33:01.200
And then, I'm gonna try
and spin this track

33:01.200 --> 33:02.900
and see if we can walk
it back into place.

33:03.433 --> 33:04.567
A little bit!

33:06.467 --> 33:08.533
Come on, come on.
That's looking good.

33:10.000 --> 33:11.100
Little more.

33:12.800 --> 33:13.967
Hold that!

33:15.800 --> 33:17.567
Walk it get back here
a little.

33:25.500 --> 33:27.200
That's what we want.

33:27.867 --> 33:28.734
Okay.

33:29.867 --> 33:31.667
Oh, yeah, we're gaining on it.

33:31.667 --> 33:33.233
We'll do a little
walking here.

33:36.166 --> 33:37.066
Got her.

33:37.066 --> 33:38.934
All we gotta do now,
tight the fitting up,

33:38.934 --> 33:40.634
put some grease back in it,

33:40.634 --> 33:42.567
and actually do some mining.

33:43.600 --> 33:46.033
I'm almost thinking now
that we got the loader here,

33:46.033 --> 33:48.634
you just go to the far side,
put your bucket down,

33:48.634 --> 33:50.433
and dude, just start
trucking through there.

33:50.433 --> 33:51.934
It'll make a big wave

33:51.934 --> 33:54.033
and it should just
flush that right out.

33:55.533 --> 33:58.433
To stop the track
falling off again,

33:58.433 --> 34:01.533
Mitch's quick fix
is to use the loader

34:01.533 --> 34:02.934
to make a wave

34:02.934 --> 34:05.867
and flush out
the clogged drainage ditch.

34:08.400 --> 34:10.333
Now, the rest of the crew

34:10.333 --> 34:12.934
can follow
on to Ken and Stuart's.

34:18.433 --> 34:19.700
Okay.

34:21.467 --> 34:24.266
So this is the pit
that we stripped,

34:24.266 --> 34:25.867
but didn't get to it last year

34:25.867 --> 34:28.834
because we had so much
to do on Tony's ground.

34:28.834 --> 34:31.900
So, like, there's a bit
of waste still in here.

34:31.900 --> 34:33.367
I think all it needs is,
like, a little bit

34:33.367 --> 34:34.700
of final trim, if that even.

34:34.700 --> 34:35.834
Okay.

34:35.834 --> 34:39.100
So if you focus on this
and could get a plant running,

34:39.100 --> 34:40.033
I don't think that...

34:40.033 --> 34:42.133
Like, I'm not trying
to press you for time,

34:42.133 --> 34:43.934
but--

34:43.934 --> 34:44.967
We need some gold?

34:44.967 --> 34:46.800
We could use some
revenue coming in, yeah.

34:46.800 --> 34:47.767
We could use some gold.

34:47.767 --> 34:51.333
Getting sluicing fastest
is the main priority.

34:51.333 --> 34:52.266
Ten four.

34:53.500 --> 34:55.967
Now mining
on two fronts,

34:55.967 --> 34:58.367
Parker has ramped up
his weekly spend

34:58.367 --> 35:01.900
and still
has no gold coming in.

35:01.900 --> 35:04.000
It's very weird
to spend that much money.

35:04.500 --> 35:05.533
Anytime anybody says,

35:05.533 --> 35:08.266
"Oh, so and so
has so much money,

35:08.266 --> 35:09.567
they couldn't even
spend it all."

35:09.567 --> 35:11.734
I'm, like...

35:13.166 --> 35:14.567
...does he wanna
buy a gold mine?

35:43.000 --> 35:44.700
We've managed to do
a bunch of trucking,

35:44.700 --> 35:46.100
moved almost...

35:46.100 --> 35:48.767
Moved basically
everybody over here.

35:50.300 --> 35:51.800
That went pretty well.

35:55.533 --> 35:57.000
The next few days,

35:57.000 --> 35:58.800
we're gonna just be
trying to open this

35:58.800 --> 36:00.300
cut up as much as we can.

36:00.300 --> 36:02.533
Hopefully, we'll be able
to get a plant up and running,

36:02.533 --> 36:06.300
working towards that
6,000 ounce goal of ours.

36:07.200 --> 36:09.433
Just half
a mile from Parker,

36:09.433 --> 36:11.767
King of the Klondike,
Tony Beets,

36:11.767 --> 36:15.266
is close to tapping
in to his biggest piggy bank.

36:27.400 --> 36:28.600
Hey!

36:31.767 --> 36:33.433
Lovely.

36:34.133 --> 36:36.033
Tony's wife, Minnie,

36:36.033 --> 36:38.567
who looks after
the family finances,

36:38.567 --> 36:41.600
is checking in to see
where the gold is.

36:42.834 --> 36:44.533
No. No.

36:44.533 --> 36:45.600
What a mess.

36:47.300 --> 36:48.433
Yeah. Well, it's your...

36:48.433 --> 36:49.767
This is your circus.

36:55.000 --> 36:56.166
Where it's dark.

36:57.567 --> 36:58.934
My chair is still here.

37:08.467 --> 37:10.700
Its good to see
some action here again though,

37:10.700 --> 37:14.700
and south.

37:14.700 --> 37:16.400
When do you think
you're gonna sluice?

37:20.400 --> 37:22.100
- Wow [bleep].
- Well, you know--

37:22.100 --> 37:24.166
'Cause, you know, you're
spending, spending, spending.

37:24.166 --> 37:27.467
It'd be nice to get something
in the piggy bank again.

37:31.967 --> 37:34.133
It always takes time.
I know that,

37:34.133 --> 37:36.133
but we need to get sluicing, too.

37:36.133 --> 37:37.867
You know, this is...

37:37.867 --> 37:40.333
It's almost a month
later than usual.

37:41.000 --> 37:42.433
So that's actually quite big.

37:51.033 --> 37:53.834
Right now,
there is money going out only.

37:53.834 --> 37:55.100
There's nothing coming in,

37:55.100 --> 37:58.433
so you better make sure
things are starting to go.

38:02.066 --> 38:03.934
It is really late.

38:15.333 --> 38:17.467
Yeah, I guess it's payday.

38:20.367 --> 38:22.533
Well, you should oversee
things so things

38:22.533 --> 38:23.800
keep moving along.

38:25.367 --> 38:26.900
No, you should be
out in the field.

38:26.900 --> 38:27.834
That works better.

38:32.600 --> 38:33.667
Coming up,

38:33.667 --> 38:36.166
Parker finds out
if his gamble

38:36.166 --> 38:39.133
for gold
has saved his season.

38:39.133 --> 38:41.166
Hopefully, we're sitting
on a mountain of gold here

38:41.166 --> 38:43.967
'cause Lord knows we need it
to pay off Dominion.

38:43.967 --> 38:45.567
All right.
I'll do some panning.

38:46.066 --> 38:47.233
Dig me a hole.

38:49.634 --> 38:51.667
And will Rick's
gold weigh be enough...

38:51.667 --> 38:52.867
There we go.

38:52.867 --> 38:55.800
...to keep his
comeback dream alive?

38:55.800 --> 39:00.433
6, 8, 12, 14...

39:09.400 --> 39:11.300
I've known Travis
for years, actually.

39:11.300 --> 39:14.667
He was cooking for Parker back
when I was Parker's foreman.

39:14.667 --> 39:16.233
Not a whole lot of people
here to cook for,

39:16.233 --> 39:19.000
so he's spending most
of his time out in the field
helping us out.

39:19.000 --> 39:21.266
You know,
I'm really thankful for that.

39:21.266 --> 39:24.400
I'm a chef by trade,
but, you know, over the years,

39:24.400 --> 39:26.266
I've jumped in wherever I...

39:26.266 --> 39:27.166
wherever I needed.

39:27.166 --> 39:29.066
I can run,
you know, rock truck,

39:29.066 --> 39:30.700
loaders, the excavators.

39:30.700 --> 39:32.500
Yeah. Rick, he's put a lot
on the line to come back

39:32.500 --> 39:36.100
up here this season and...
he's a great guy,

39:36.100 --> 39:37.867
so I'm just here to bust ass

39:37.867 --> 39:40.000
and make a successful
team out of it.

39:56.567 --> 39:59.367
Well, Tyson, I hope
we'll be the first...

39:59.367 --> 40:02.400
the first ones bringing
that first check in

40:02.400 --> 40:04.467
to start paying our bills.

40:04.467 --> 40:05.834
Yeah, hopefully,
we're sitting

40:05.834 --> 40:08.600
on a mountain of gold
here 'cause Lord knows

40:08.600 --> 40:10.900
we need it
to pay off Dominion.

40:10.900 --> 40:14.266
Move gravel, find
the leprechaun, get gold.

40:14.266 --> 40:16.233
To get on
the gold fast,

40:17.967 --> 40:20.734
Parker has kick-started
a second operation

40:20.734 --> 40:22.300
at Ken and Stuart's.

40:31.667 --> 40:32.667
How you doing?

40:32.667 --> 40:33.934
Good. How are you?

40:33.934 --> 40:35.567
- All right.
I'll do some panning.
- Oh, yeah.

40:35.567 --> 40:36.900
Dig me a hole.

40:41.266 --> 40:42.500
Against the bank.

41:01.266 --> 41:03.467
Parker inspects
the ground to see

41:03.467 --> 41:05.700
if Tyson is down to pay.

41:09.967 --> 41:12.500
I thought he was
gonna cut bedrock here.

41:22.800 --> 41:24.367
You've got
a lot more waste in here

41:24.367 --> 41:26.333
than we bargained for, huh?

41:26.333 --> 41:29.033
I bet there's probably
five feet in here at least

41:29.033 --> 41:30.266
of waste.

41:30.266 --> 41:33.233
'Cause some areas down here,
I've run into, like,

41:33.233 --> 41:35.533
eight feet of that big,
coarse rock, right?

41:35.533 --> 41:36.467
Yeah.

41:36.467 --> 41:38.600
I don't know how long
it's gonna take you.

41:38.600 --> 41:39.867
You got a lot of gravel.

41:41.900 --> 41:44.600
Parker
has massively underestimated

41:44.600 --> 41:47.500
how long it will
take to get sluicing.

41:47.500 --> 41:49.433
I'll try to get you
some reinforcement

41:49.433 --> 41:50.967
so you can speed it up, but--

41:50.967 --> 41:53.400
- Okay.
- Yeah,
timeline is blowing up.

41:56.500 --> 41:59.500
This isn't nearly
what we thought it was, huh?

41:59.500 --> 42:02.533
It could be weeks
before they run pay,

42:02.533 --> 42:06.000
shattering Parker's
plan for fast gold

42:06.000 --> 42:09.533
and upping the odds
for going broke.

42:12.967 --> 42:15.400
I don't know.
We can't really afford
to free anybody else up.

42:16.133 --> 42:17.100
All right.

42:17.100 --> 42:18.634
Stripping crew needs
to strip...

42:21.400 --> 42:24.233
even if it's not gonna make us
any money this year,

42:24.233 --> 42:26.166
can't
the program totally.

42:28.033 --> 42:29.066
Oh, boy.

42:29.066 --> 42:30.667
Really thought we're
gonna have a plant

42:30.667 --> 42:33.734
running sooner than this,
but, yeah.

42:33.734 --> 42:34.900
Not ideal.

42:45.934 --> 42:47.066
Where's the boss?

42:47.066 --> 42:49.667
Yeah, where's old Richard?

42:49.667 --> 42:53.066
After Buzz
fixed the ancient rock truck,

42:53.066 --> 42:55.734
Rick has hit
the second stockpile

42:55.734 --> 42:58.734
and kept the plant
running all week.

42:58.734 --> 42:59.767
What's up, nerds?

42:59.767 --> 43:00.934
Hey, boss guy.

43:00.934 --> 43:02.900
You guys didn't get
in the beer yet.

43:04.400 --> 43:05.567
There you go, buddy.

43:05.567 --> 43:06.433
Morgan?

43:06.433 --> 43:07.533
Is she old enough?

43:10.200 --> 43:11.667
And I gotta
be honest with you,

43:11.667 --> 43:13.367
coming from Fred,
I didn't have much hope.

43:14.867 --> 43:16.667
I'm just gonna say it.

43:16.667 --> 43:18.867
But, um,
you got that truck running

43:18.867 --> 43:20.600
for us and that...
You know, that's huge.

43:20.600 --> 43:21.467
That helps us out a lot.

43:21.467 --> 43:23.400
Hope to see some
good [bleep] gold.

43:23.400 --> 43:24.667
- Yeah?
- Nice.

43:24.667 --> 43:25.900
That'd be a change, huh?

43:25.900 --> 43:28.367
- Yeah, big change, Rick.
- Yeah, yeah.

43:28.367 --> 43:30.533
I mean, I don't...
I don't know a whole
lot about, you know,

43:30.533 --> 43:32.734
what went on over with
Fred and all that stuff.

43:32.734 --> 43:34.800
I know that there was not
a whole lot of luck out there,

43:34.800 --> 43:37.600
but, you know, what do you
think, coming over here?

43:37.600 --> 43:40.433
I'm coming from hell
into heaven.

43:42.200 --> 43:43.600
That is [bleep].

43:44.834 --> 43:46.634
The last couple
of seasons with Fred,

43:46.634 --> 43:49.734
it hasn't even covered
my own personal costs.

43:50.900 --> 43:52.800
All right.
Let's weigh some gold.

43:52.800 --> 43:54.333
To cover his costs,

43:54.333 --> 43:57.166
Rick needs 20 ounces a week.

43:57.166 --> 44:00.800
6, 8,

44:00.800 --> 44:03.600
12, 14,

44:03.600 --> 44:07.000
16, 18...

44:10.367 --> 44:14.000
23.28.

44:14.000 --> 44:15.800
23.28, hell yeah.

44:15.800 --> 44:16.767
Beautiful.

44:16.767 --> 44:20.367
Worth $46,000.

44:20.367 --> 44:22.200
That's like an ounce
better than the best

44:22.200 --> 44:24.100
gold weigh
the Misfits ever had.

44:24.100 --> 44:25.600
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

44:25.600 --> 44:27.400
Well, [bleep] me.
I'm just getting started.

44:27.400 --> 44:30.734
Now, this week, I think
we're at 65.2 ounces...

44:30.734 --> 44:32.100
65.21 ounces.

44:32.100 --> 44:33.133
I'm very happy with that.

44:33.133 --> 44:34.800
And that's what I need
right now.

44:34.800 --> 44:36.166
I need to be able
to put that in the bank

44:36.166 --> 44:37.533
'cause I have to get,
you know,

44:37.533 --> 44:38.700
more guys like you here,

44:38.700 --> 44:40.300
girls like you, you know,
more machines,

44:40.300 --> 44:42.867
so that we can move forward
and, you know,

44:42.867 --> 44:44.934
start pushing more yards
yardage through,
getting more gold.

44:44.934 --> 44:48.200
With you guys' help,
I think we can have another
successful year here.

44:48.200 --> 44:50.400
I'd love to make it
official here for Buzz.

44:50.400 --> 44:51.300
Ooh.

44:51.300 --> 44:53.133
We got a hoodie,
a couple T-shirts for you.

44:53.133 --> 44:55.166
- Nice.
- Rally! Incorporated. Welcome.

44:55.166 --> 44:56.533
Sweet, man. Thank you.

44:58.467 --> 45:00.700
All right. Well,

45:00.700 --> 45:02.233
I say we cheers,
I get this gold inside,

45:02.233 --> 45:03.800
and we get the hell
out of here.

45:03.800 --> 45:05.333
Cheers.
