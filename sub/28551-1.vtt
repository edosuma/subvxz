00:17.021 --> 00:18.979
(footsteps walking)

00:19.062 --> 00:22.646
(door opens, closes)

00:22.730 --> 00:24.813
(walking footsteps)

00:29.396 --> 00:31.979
-(glass clinking)
-(liquid pouring)

00:33.271 --> 00:35.896
(tape rewinding)

00:38.021 --> 00:39.813
(tape recorder clicks off)

00:42.521 --> 00:46.062
Man (recorded voice):
What is the cost of lies?

00:46.146 --> 00:49.021
It's not that we'll mistake
them for the truth.

00:49.104 --> 00:52.979
The real danger is that
if we hear enough lies,

00:53.062 --> 00:56.104
then we no longer
recognize the truth at all.

00:57.605 --> 00:59.271
What can we do then?

00:59.354 --> 01:02.021
What else is left
but to abandon even
the hope of truth

01:02.104 --> 01:06.688
and content
ourselves instead
with stories?

01:06.771 --> 01:10.896
In these stories,
it doesn't matter
who the heroes are.

01:10.979 --> 01:14.521
All we want to know is:
who is to blame?

01:14.605 --> 01:17.187
In this story,
it was Anatoly Dyatlov.

01:17.271 --> 01:18.979
He was the best choice.

01:19.062 --> 01:21.062
An arrogant, unpleasant man,

01:21.146 --> 01:24.354
he ran the room that night,
he gave the orders...

01:24.438 --> 01:26.354
and no friends.

01:26.438 --> 01:30.104
Or, at least,
not important ones.

01:31.563 --> 01:35.438
And now Dyatlov will spend
the next ten years

01:35.521 --> 01:37.563
in a prison labor camp.

01:37.646 --> 01:41.021
Of course, that sentence
is doubly unfair.

01:42.479 --> 01:46.187
There were far greater
criminals than him at work.

01:47.979 --> 01:50.896
And as for what Dyatlov did do,

01:50.979 --> 01:53.354
the man doesn't deserve prison.

01:54.521 --> 01:57.354
He deserves death.

01:58.813 --> 02:00.146
(recorder clicks)

02:00.229 --> 02:01.688
(clears throat)

02:10.187 --> 02:15.104
But instead, ten years
for "criminal mismanagement."

02:15.187 --> 02:17.187
What does that mean?

02:17.271 --> 02:21.021
No one knows.
It doesn't matter.

02:23.146 --> 02:26.688
What does matter
is that, to them,

02:26.771 --> 02:28.979
justice was done.

02:29.062 --> 02:32.646
Because, you see, to them

02:32.730 --> 02:36.438
a just world is a sane world.

02:38.896 --> 02:41.896
There was nothing sane
about Chernobyl.

02:43.605 --> 02:45.771
What happened there,
what happened after,

02:45.855 --> 02:49.187
even the good we did,
all of it...

02:50.646 --> 02:55.187
all of it... madness.

02:59.646 --> 03:03.730
Well, I've given you
everything I know.

03:05.730 --> 03:08.271
They'll deny it, of course.

03:08.354 --> 03:10.104
They always do.

03:15.521 --> 03:17.937
I know you'll try your best.

03:26.271 --> 03:28.396
(tape rewinding)

05:13.187 --> 05:14.937
(sighs)

05:21.521 --> 05:25.062
(door opens, closes)

05:38.521 --> 05:40.855
(ticking)

05:53.605 --> 05:55.771
(ticking)

06:03.937 --> 06:08.021
(furniture scraping floor)

06:08.104 --> 06:10.187
(ticking)

06:10.271 --> 06:13.187
(furniture clatters)

06:13.271 --> 06:15.937
(rope creaking)

06:42.813 --> 06:46.271
(woman vomits, coughs)

06:47.354 --> 06:49.479
(woman groans, pants)

06:52.730 --> 06:54.979
(toilet flushing)

07:04.229 --> 07:08.187
(snoring softly)

07:37.271 --> 07:40.479
-(distant explosion)
-(gasps)

07:41.146 --> 07:42.646
Man:
Lyudmilla?

07:42.730 --> 07:46.229
(dogs barking outside)

08:00.438 --> 08:02.563
(barking continuing)

08:04.813 --> 08:06.937
(debris swishing)

08:07.563 --> 08:09.855
Man (distant, muffled voice):
Comrade Dyatlov!

08:13.271 --> 08:17.396
Comrade Dyatlov!
Comrade Dyatlov!

08:21.771 --> 08:24.646
(shouting):
Comrade Dyatlov!
Comrade Dyatlov!

08:24.730 --> 08:27.438
-(alarms blaring)
-What just happened?

08:27.521 --> 08:30.605
-I don't know.
-(alarms blaring, buzzing)

08:30.688 --> 08:32.896
There's a fire
in the turbine hall.

08:34.354 --> 08:35.771
The turbine hall.

08:36.855 --> 08:39.896
The control system tank.
Hydrogen.

08:39.979 --> 08:41.937
You and Toptunov,
you morons blew the tank!

08:42.021 --> 08:44.271
-No, that's not--
-This is an emergency.

08:44.354 --> 08:46.313
Everyone stay calm.
Our first priority is--

08:46.396 --> 08:47.855
-It's exploded!
-We know.

08:47.937 --> 08:49.396
Akimov, are we cooling
the reactor core?

08:49.479 --> 08:51.313
We shut it down,
but the control rods
are still active.

08:51.396 --> 08:53.187
They're not all the way in,
I disengaged the clutch.

08:53.271 --> 08:55.855
Try and disconnect the servos
from the standby console.

08:55.937 --> 08:57.354
You two, get
the backup pumps running.

08:57.438 --> 08:59.146
We need water moving
through the core.

08:59.229 --> 09:02.187
-That is all that matters.
-There is no core.

09:02.271 --> 09:04.605
It exploded,
the core exploded.

09:04.688 --> 09:06.813
(alarms blaring, buzzing)

09:08.104 --> 09:10.271
He's in shock.
Get him out of here.

09:10.354 --> 09:11.605
The lid is off!

09:11.688 --> 09:13.479
The stack is burning.
I saw it.

09:13.563 --> 09:16.438
You're confused.
RBMK reactor cores
don't explode.

09:16.521 --> 09:17.855
-Akimov...
-(whispers): Sasha.

09:17.937 --> 09:19.146
Don't worry,
we did everything right.

09:19.229 --> 09:21.187
Something...
something strange has happened.

09:21.271 --> 09:23.396
-Do you taste metal?
-Akimov!

09:23.479 --> 09:26.396
Comrade Perevozschenko,
what you're saying is
physically impossible.

09:26.479 --> 09:29.813
The core can't explode.
It has to be the tank.

09:30.479 --> 09:32.187
We're wasting time.
Let's go.

09:32.271 --> 09:35.062
Get the hydrogen
out of the generators
and pump water into the core.

09:35.146 --> 09:39.313
-What about the fire?
-Call the fire brigade.

09:39.396 --> 09:42.354
(alarms blaring, buzzing)

09:47.730 --> 09:50.396
(distant alarm blaring)

09:50.479 --> 09:53.146
(footsteps crunching glass)

10:01.979 --> 10:06.146
(wind whistling)

10:14.521 --> 10:17.521
(distant alarms
continue blaring)

10:39.688 --> 10:41.271
(loud tone drones)

10:41.354 --> 10:43.521
(voices over phone
speaking Russian)

11:01.479 --> 11:03.563
(loud tone drones)

11:14.229 --> 11:15.479
(loud tone drones)

11:15.563 --> 11:17.354
You're not on call tonight.

11:17.438 --> 11:19.521
Man:
They're bringing everybody in,
military and civil.

11:19.605 --> 11:23.646
Pripyat, Polesskoe, Kiev.

11:23.730 --> 11:25.605
This is a big one.

11:26.563 --> 11:29.229
But it doesn't look right,
the color.

11:29.313 --> 11:32.855
Pravik says
he thinks they're shining
floodlights or something.

11:32.937 --> 11:34.313
And what if
there are chemicals?

11:34.396 --> 11:36.730
(chuckles):
Chemicals?

11:37.771 --> 11:39.313
The problem's the roof.

11:39.396 --> 11:42.187
It's covered in tar,
so it's gonna burn all night,

11:42.271 --> 11:44.855
and it'll stink like hell.
That's it.

11:44.937 --> 11:46.771
That's the worst of it.

11:48.730 --> 11:50.021
Go back to bed.

11:50.104 --> 11:53.438
(door opens, closes)

11:56.563 --> 11:58.813
(alarms blaring)

12:18.771 --> 12:21.271
(muffled clattering above)

12:25.937 --> 12:28.855
-Is it war?
-Where's the dosimeter?

12:28.937 --> 12:32.021
Here... Here.

12:33.187 --> 12:35.937
(debris clattering)

12:37.813 --> 12:39.479
Are they bombing?

12:40.146 --> 12:42.021
(dosimeter beeps)

12:42.104 --> 12:45.062
What the fuck is this?
It's 3.6 roentgen.

12:45.146 --> 12:47.688
That's as high as it goes.
The good one's locked in a safe.

12:47.771 --> 12:49.187
I don't have a key.

12:49.271 --> 12:53.521
Valera... your face.

12:55.021 --> 12:56.396
Come on.

12:56.479 --> 12:59.354
I'm going to find Khodemchuk
in the pump room.

12:59.438 --> 13:01.396
You... here.

13:01.479 --> 13:05.104
Get Shashenok.
He's in 604. Go.

13:05.187 --> 13:06.855
We need to get
everyone out!

13:06.937 --> 13:09.021
(alarm blaring)

13:15.438 --> 13:17.521
(vomits, coughing)

13:18.646 --> 13:21.396
(whimpers)
Shit.

13:21.479 --> 13:23.855
Hey! We need to get
to the reactor hall.

13:23.937 --> 13:26.937
-The lift's destroyed.
-Up two flights and across.

13:27.021 --> 13:30.438
-Right.
-Why are you going there?

13:30.521 --> 13:32.646
(distant alarm blaring)

13:38.937 --> 13:43.187
(clangs echoing)

13:45.021 --> 13:47.771
-(clangs)
-(grunts)

13:49.688 --> 13:51.730
Have you seen
Khodemchuk?

13:51.813 --> 13:54.271
-No. Where's Viktor?
-Still in the pump room.

13:55.855 --> 13:58.688
-(Perevozschenko vomits)
-Stay here. I'll come back.

14:01.563 --> 14:03.271
Viktor!

14:17.730 --> 14:19.813
(man coughing)

14:21.563 --> 14:22.605
Viktor.

14:22.688 --> 14:25.813
-(coughing)
-Viktor.

14:27.062 --> 14:29.730
Viktor. I'm gonna get
you out of here.

14:29.813 --> 14:31.688
-Can you stand?
-(coughs)

14:31.771 --> 14:33.979
(weakly):
Khodemchuk...

14:34.062 --> 14:35.730
Where?

14:38.104 --> 14:40.313
Viktor (gasping):
Get Khodemchuk.

14:43.979 --> 14:46.979
(fluttering)

14:57.605 --> 15:00.021
(metal groaning)

15:02.813 --> 15:04.979
(gasping)

15:13.104 --> 15:16.979
(distant sirens approaching)

15:22.062 --> 15:23.313
(alarms blaring, buzzing)

15:23.396 --> 15:25.438
I dropped the control rods
from the other panel.

15:25.521 --> 15:27.229
-Akimov: They're still up.
-Dyatlov: What?

15:27.313 --> 15:29.730
They're still only
a third of the way in,
I don't know why.

15:29.813 --> 15:32.271
I already sent the trainees
down to the reactor hall
to lower them by hand.

15:32.354 --> 15:34.313
-What about the pumps?
-Toptunov: I can't get
through to Khodemchuk.

15:34.396 --> 15:37.021
-The lines are down.
-Fuck the phones
and fuck Khodemchuk.

15:37.104 --> 15:38.521
-Are the pumps on or not?
-Stolyarchuk?

15:38.605 --> 15:40.104
My control panel's
not working.

15:40.187 --> 15:41.605
I tried calling
for the electricians.

15:41.688 --> 15:43.313
I don't give a shit
about the panel!

15:43.396 --> 15:45.937
I need water in my reactor core!

15:46.021 --> 15:48.563
Get down there and make sure
those pumps are on.

15:49.730 --> 15:51.313
Now!

15:58.730 --> 16:02.396
-What does the dosimeter say?
-3.6 roentgen, but that's
as high as the meter--

16:02.479 --> 16:05.229
3.6-- not great,
not terrible.

16:13.146 --> 16:15.354
(in undertone):
We did everything right.

16:19.021 --> 16:22.271
(sirens wailing)

16:33.937 --> 16:36.062
(sirens wailing)

16:45.896 --> 16:49.896
(indistinct radio transmissions)

16:52.438 --> 16:54.229
(indistinct shouting)

16:59.730 --> 17:02.021
Commander:
You, connect those hooks!

17:05.521 --> 17:07.021
(men shouting)

17:07.104 --> 17:08.479
Commander:
Get the pumps going!

17:08.563 --> 17:10.813
Man:
Yeah, over here!

17:14.479 --> 17:17.563
-(alarms blaring)
-Man: We're working
bottom to top. Go in fast.

17:38.479 --> 17:40.062
Vasily...

17:41.438 --> 17:44.104
-Hey, Vasily, what's this?
-I don't know, Misha.

17:44.187 --> 17:46.688
Don't fuck around with it.
Hook these up, come on.

17:52.271 --> 17:53.730
Do you taste metal?

17:53.813 --> 17:57.021
-Yeah, what is that?
-I don't know.

17:58.771 --> 18:00.313
The valves, Misha!
The valves, let's go!

18:00.396 --> 18:02.021
The valves! Come on!

18:05.855 --> 18:07.979
(sirens wailing)

18:16.979 --> 18:18.896
(footsteps echoing)

18:18.979 --> 18:21.146
(distant siren wailing)

18:34.479 --> 18:35.563
What do you need?

18:35.646 --> 18:37.896
We need to get
into the reactor hall

18:37.979 --> 18:40.396
to lower the control rods,
but the door is jammed.

18:41.646 --> 18:43.605
I don't think there are
control rods.

18:43.688 --> 18:45.354
I don't think there's a core.

18:47.521 --> 18:49.396
No, you're--
you're mistaken.

18:50.354 --> 18:51.646
Akimov said.

19:09.062 --> 19:10.396
Let's go.

19:23.354 --> 19:24.979
(Misha wailing): No!

19:25.062 --> 19:28.813
-(Misha screaming)
-Ignatenko, get on his hose!

19:28.896 --> 19:30.730
It's all right. Breathe.

19:30.813 --> 19:32.479
-(Misha whimpering)
-Misha.

19:32.563 --> 19:34.563
All right, all right.
Easy, Misha.

19:37.855 --> 19:40.187
(grunts)

19:40.271 --> 19:42.396
(groaning)

20:02.605 --> 20:05.646
(alarms buzzing)

20:11.438 --> 20:13.271
Are you sure?

20:14.730 --> 20:16.062
Akimov...

20:20.438 --> 20:22.730
-(men grunting)
-(metal scraping)

20:29.438 --> 20:30.979
Move.

20:38.021 --> 20:40.021
(grunting)

20:41.313 --> 20:42.979
Come on, go!

20:46.313 --> 20:48.146
(grunts, speaks indistinctly)

20:48.813 --> 20:50.937
(grunts, panting)

20:53.855 --> 20:56.646
(door creaking)

21:19.855 --> 21:21.937
(grunts)

21:22.021 --> 21:23.605
Let's go!

21:23.688 --> 21:25.021
Let's go!

21:26.521 --> 21:27.896
Hey!

21:27.979 --> 21:29.563
(gasps)

21:32.521 --> 21:34.563
(groans)

21:34.646 --> 21:35.813
Hey!

21:35.896 --> 21:38.021
(alarm buzzing)

21:40.896 --> 21:43.354
(panting)

21:47.354 --> 21:49.479
(people chattering)

21:51.521 --> 21:54.354
(distant sirens wailing)

21:56.354 --> 21:58.646
Woman:
Lyudmilla! Do you
want to come with us?

21:58.730 --> 22:00.021
Come where?

22:00.104 --> 22:02.187
We're going to the railroad
bridge to get a better look.

22:02.271 --> 22:04.646
It's not like anyone
can sleep with all the sirens.

22:04.730 --> 22:06.896
I don't think you should go.
It could be dangerous.

22:06.979 --> 22:10.146
What do you mean dangerous?
It's a fire. It's over there,
we're over here.

22:10.229 --> 22:11.855
-Mikhail.
-What?

22:13.396 --> 22:15.354
Oh, sorry.

22:15.438 --> 22:17.021
Oh.

22:19.730 --> 22:22.313
-Oksana: Is Vasily...?
-Yeah.

22:22.396 --> 22:23.979
Did he say it was bad?

22:24.062 --> 22:25.979
No. No, he said it was
just the roof.

22:26.062 --> 22:27.396
Well, he's never
gotten hurt before.

22:27.479 --> 22:29.104
None of the boys have.

22:30.187 --> 22:31.855
He'll be fine.

22:33.187 --> 22:34.563
Get some rest.

22:38.229 --> 22:40.396
(distant sirens continuing)

22:46.062 --> 22:48.021
Dyatlov:
The tank,
it's big enough.

22:48.104 --> 22:52.354
This kind of explosion,
the control tank on 71,
it's 100 cubic meters.

22:52.438 --> 22:53.771
One hundred and ten.

22:53.855 --> 22:56.605
Hundred and ten.
It could do this, definitely.

22:56.688 --> 23:00.021
(panting):
It's gone.

23:00.104 --> 23:02.187
I looked right into it.

23:02.271 --> 23:03.979
I looked into the core.

23:05.104 --> 23:07.855
Did you lower
the control rods or not?

23:07.937 --> 23:10.313
(retching)

23:10.396 --> 23:12.771
Take him
to the infirmary.

23:14.271 --> 23:15.979
Toptunov, take him!

23:19.396 --> 23:23.104
-Where's Kudryavstev?
-He fell.

23:23.187 --> 23:26.229
-Toptunov:
I need a medic! Anyone!
-He's delusional.

23:26.313 --> 23:28.730
-His face...
-Ruptured condenser lines.

23:28.813 --> 23:30.730
The feedwater is
mildly contaminated.

23:30.813 --> 23:32.479
He'll be fine.
I've seen worse.

23:32.563 --> 23:34.979
Do we still have
a phone line to the outside?

23:36.813 --> 23:39.521
-Akimov?
-(grunts)

23:39.605 --> 23:41.646
Call in the day shift.

23:42.855 --> 23:45.229
-But if the--
-We have to keep water
flowing into the core.

23:45.313 --> 23:48.646
We need electricians,
mechanics, we need bodies.

23:49.438 --> 23:52.021
How many times
do I have to say it?

23:59.937 --> 24:02.104
I'm going to
the Administration Building now

24:02.187 --> 24:04.730
to call Bryukhanov and Fomin.

24:04.813 --> 24:07.229
They're gonna want
a full report.

24:08.271 --> 24:12.104
Now, I don't know if I can
make things better for you,

24:12.187 --> 24:15.021
but I can certainly
make them worse.

24:17.021 --> 24:19.646
Call in the day shift,
Comrade Akimov.

24:23.187 --> 24:24.855
Yes, Comrade Dyatlov.

24:33.354 --> 24:35.313
(sighs)

24:37.979 --> 24:39.313
(door closes)

24:57.563 --> 25:00.563
-(woman moans softly)
-You're doing fine.

25:00.646 --> 25:02.563
Raise her up.

25:05.646 --> 25:07.313
That one,
maybe an hour.

25:07.396 --> 25:09.563
This one,
not until morning.

25:11.646 --> 25:15.605
-How's it
downstairs, doctor?
-Quiet.

25:15.688 --> 25:17.396
Always is.

25:17.479 --> 25:20.229
Nothing at this hour
but babies.

25:21.104 --> 25:23.979
You know, I once went
two days without sleep?

25:24.062 --> 25:26.688
Ten women went into labor
at the same time.

25:26.771 --> 25:29.146
-Did I ever tell
you that story?
-Yes.

25:31.271 --> 25:33.021
Well, I won't need you
in here for a while.

25:33.104 --> 25:35.896
If you want, get some rest
in the break room.

25:36.771 --> 25:38.937
They haven't brought
anyone in from the fire.

25:39.021 --> 25:42.104
-What fire?
-The power plant.

25:42.771 --> 25:45.771
Oh. Then it
mustn't be too bad.

25:47.021 --> 25:48.771
Do we stock iodine?

25:48.855 --> 25:50.771
-Hmm?
-Iodine.

25:51.937 --> 25:56.062
-You mean disinfectant?
-No, pills. Does the hospital
stock iodine pills?

25:56.146 --> 25:59.104
Iodine pills?
Why would we have
iodine pills?

25:59.813 --> 26:01.937
(phone rings)

26:04.771 --> 26:06.813
(phone rings)

26:09.896 --> 26:11.229
(phone rings)

26:11.313 --> 26:13.605
Hello?
(coughing)

26:14.688 --> 26:16.104
Hello?

26:23.271 --> 26:25.146
Who else knows this?

26:27.021 --> 26:28.688
Have you called Fomin?

26:29.979 --> 26:31.896
Of course I want you
to call him.

26:31.979 --> 26:34.187
If I'm up, he's up.

26:57.229 --> 26:59.646
(sirens wailing)

27:12.521 --> 27:14.438
Fomin:
Whatever the cause,
the important thing is

27:14.521 --> 27:16.229
that neither you nor I--

27:50.605 --> 27:53.104
(heavy door thudding)

27:57.354 --> 27:59.354
I take it the safety test
was a failure?

27:59.438 --> 28:02.688
-We have the situation
under control.
-Fomin: Under control?

28:02.771 --> 28:05.563
-It doesn't look like
it's under control.
-Shut up, Fomin.

28:06.896 --> 28:09.521
I have to tell the Central
Committee about this.
Do you realize that?

28:09.605 --> 28:11.896
I have to get on the phone
and tell Maryin,

28:11.979 --> 28:13.438
or God forbid Frolyshev,

28:13.521 --> 28:15.229
that my power plant
is on fire.

28:15.313 --> 28:17.730
No one can blame you for this,
Director Bryukhanov.

28:17.813 --> 28:19.521
Of course no one can
blame me for this.

28:19.605 --> 28:22.771
How can I be responsible?
I was sleeping.

28:23.605 --> 28:25.937
Tell me what happened,
quickly.

28:27.396 --> 28:31.104
We ran the test exactly as
Chief Engineer Fomin approved.

28:31.187 --> 28:33.813
Unit Shift Chief Akimov
and Engineer Toptunov

28:33.896 --> 28:36.354
encountered technical
difficulties leading

28:36.438 --> 28:39.771
to an accumulation of hydrogen
in the control system tank.

28:39.855 --> 28:41.396
It regrettably ignited,

28:41.479 --> 28:44.104
damaging the plant,
setting the roof on fire.

28:46.354 --> 28:48.229
The tank is quite large.

28:48.313 --> 28:50.354
It's the only
logical explanation.

28:50.438 --> 28:53.896
Of course, Deputy Chief
Engineer Dyatlov

28:53.979 --> 28:56.605
was directly
supervising the test,

28:56.688 --> 28:58.104
so he would know best.

28:58.187 --> 29:00.479
-Bryukhanov:
A hydrogen tank, fire...
-(pen scribbling)

29:02.521 --> 29:04.563
-Reactor?
-We're taking
measures to ensure

29:04.646 --> 29:07.062
a steady flow of water
through the core.

29:07.146 --> 29:10.104
-What about radiation?
-Obviously, down here
it's nothing.

29:10.187 --> 29:12.896
But in the reactor building,
I'm being told

29:12.979 --> 29:15.021
3.6 roentgen per hour.

29:15.104 --> 29:17.271
Well, that's not great,
but it's not horrifying.

29:17.354 --> 29:18.937
Not at all.

29:19.021 --> 29:22.062
-From the feedwater,
I assume?
-Mm-hmm.

29:22.146 --> 29:24.438
We'll have
to limit shifts

29:24.521 --> 29:26.605
to six hours at a time,
but otherwise...

29:26.688 --> 29:29.271
The dosimetrists
should be checking regularly.

29:30.146 --> 29:34.062
Have them use
the good meter from the safe.

29:35.146 --> 29:38.313
Right.
I'll call Maryin.

29:39.271 --> 29:41.521
Have them wake up the local
executive committee.

29:41.605 --> 29:43.771
There'll be orders
coming down.

29:43.855 --> 29:46.896
(crowd murmuring)

29:49.521 --> 29:50.979
-Here.
-(whispers): No.

29:51.062 --> 29:53.688
You sure? Okay.

29:56.688 --> 29:59.354
-What do you think
makes the colors?
-Oh...

30:00.021 --> 30:03.396
-It's the fuel for sure.
-"Oh. It's the fuel for sure"?

30:03.479 --> 30:06.896
What do you know about it?
You clean floors
at a train station.

30:06.979 --> 30:08.688
My friend, Yuri, works
at the power plant.

30:08.771 --> 30:10.354
He says it runs cold.

30:10.438 --> 30:12.229
No gas, no fire. Just atoms.

30:13.021 --> 30:15.479
Yuri says the only thing is,
you can't walk right up
to the fuel.

30:15.563 --> 30:18.438
If you do, a glass of vodka
an hour for four hours.

30:18.521 --> 30:21.438
(laughs)
Isn't Yuri a plumber?

30:21.521 --> 30:23.937
At the nuclear
power plant, yeah.

30:30.479 --> 30:32.062
It is beautiful.

30:33.104 --> 30:34.730
Yeah.

30:41.979 --> 30:45.354
(wind blowing softly)

31:45.354 --> 31:47.479
(distant alarm wailing)

31:50.979 --> 31:52.937
(coughing)

32:26.354 --> 32:28.354
Do you have a cigarette?

32:53.646 --> 32:55.646
Do you need help?

33:01.646 --> 33:03.730
It's over.

33:05.896 --> 33:08.062
(distant sirens continuing)

33:23.229 --> 33:26.396
(trickling, pattering)

33:55.479 --> 33:57.730
(indistinct shouting)

34:07.813 --> 34:09.521
We've done all we can
from the perimeter.

34:09.605 --> 34:12.438
We need to start making
our way to the roof.

34:18.438 --> 34:21.771
Vasily!
You've gotta put it out.

34:25.146 --> 34:28.187
Pravik:
That's enough, comrades.
We're pushing ahead.

34:34.313 --> 34:35.937
Pravik:
Come on, boys.

34:41.605 --> 34:43.479
Vasily, it's just past,
straight up.

34:43.563 --> 34:45.479
All the way up,
all the way in.

34:47.521 --> 34:49.021
Come on!

35:01.146 --> 35:03.313
Fireman:
Yeah. Going in now.

35:44.104 --> 35:46.313
(distant alarms
blaring, buzzing)

35:50.479 --> 35:52.730
What about the auxiliary?

35:52.813 --> 35:56.229
The pumps are gone,
electrical's gone.

35:56.313 --> 36:00.229
-The core?
-I didn't go in there,
and I won't.

36:02.229 --> 36:04.479
-I think it's time we faced--
-No, we have to get water
into the core.

36:04.563 --> 36:06.313
Otherwise,
there'll be a meltdown.

36:06.396 --> 36:08.313
We have to open
the valves.

36:08.396 --> 36:10.605
-Sasha...
-What do you want, Boris?

36:10.688 --> 36:12.479
If it's true, then we're dead,
a million people are dead.

36:12.563 --> 36:14.730
Is that what
you need to hear?

36:16.187 --> 36:18.146
We have to open the valves.

36:18.229 --> 36:20.354
-By hand.
-By hand?

36:20.438 --> 36:22.979
You know, the number of valves,
the amount of time
to turn them,

36:23.062 --> 36:24.688
you're talking
about hours in there!

36:24.771 --> 36:26.313
-Then help us.
-Help you do what?

36:26.396 --> 36:29.730
Pump water into a ditch?
There's nothing there!

36:38.937 --> 36:40.896
Leonid, I'm begging you.

36:54.271 --> 36:55.937
Watch the panel
while we're gone.

36:56.021 --> 36:57.479
It's not working.

36:58.563 --> 37:00.396
Just watch it.

37:05.271 --> 37:06.896
(door closes)

37:17.855 --> 37:19.229
(crying)

37:19.313 --> 37:21.979
(distant sirens wailing)

37:22.062 --> 37:23.813
Worker:
I guess we know why
they called us in early.

37:23.896 --> 37:26.563
Sitnikov:
Is anyone saying
what happened?

37:26.646 --> 37:28.896
Worker:
They were running the safety
test on the turbines,

37:28.979 --> 37:31.104
blew the control system tank.

37:32.229 --> 37:33.646
It doesn't make sense
to me either.

37:35.396 --> 37:37.521
What about sabotage?

37:37.605 --> 37:39.146
A bomb?

37:40.021 --> 37:43.479
Sitnikov!
Bryukhanov wants us
to use the good dosimeter,

37:43.563 --> 37:46.354
but it's in the safe,
and we can't find the key.

37:46.438 --> 37:49.771
It's in Building 2.
Hasn't--?

37:49.855 --> 37:51.521
Follow me.

37:53.563 --> 37:55.521
(door opens)

38:02.937 --> 38:04.438
Gentlemen, welcome.

38:04.521 --> 38:07.688
Please, uh, find a seat.
Plenty of room.

38:07.771 --> 38:11.271
I apologize for
the lateness of the hour.

38:11.354 --> 38:15.438
Rest assured, we are all
very safe down here.

38:15.521 --> 38:18.187
We built this shelter
to withstand a nuclear attack

38:18.271 --> 38:21.563
by the Americans,
so I think we'll be fine.

38:23.271 --> 38:25.605
As you can see, we have
experienced an accident.

38:25.688 --> 38:28.271
A large control tank
malfunctioned,

38:28.354 --> 38:32.229
damaging reactor Building 4
and starting a fire.

38:32.313 --> 38:35.979
Now, I have spoken directly
to Deputy Secretary Maryin.

38:36.062 --> 38:38.313
Maryin spoke
to Deputy Chief Frolyshev,

38:38.396 --> 38:41.605
Frolyshev to Central Committee
member Dolgikh,

38:41.688 --> 38:44.979
and Dolgikh to
General Secretary Gorbachev.

38:45.062 --> 38:46.896
Now...

38:46.979 --> 38:52.229
Because the Central Committee
has the greatest respect

38:52.313 --> 38:56.271
for the work of the Pripyat
Executive Committee,

38:56.354 --> 39:00.354
they have asked me to brief you
on matters as they stand, so...

39:01.896 --> 39:05.646
First, the accident...
(stammers) is well
under control.

39:05.730 --> 39:10.979
And second, because the efforts
of the Soviet nuclear industry

39:11.062 --> 39:14.771
are considered key state
secrets, it is important

39:14.855 --> 39:18.187
that we ensure
that this incident

39:18.271 --> 39:20.354
has no adverse consequences.

39:20.438 --> 39:24.563
Now, to prevent a panic,
the Central Committee
have ordered

39:24.646 --> 39:27.521
a detachment of military
police to Pripyat.

39:27.605 --> 39:29.438
How large of a detachment?

39:30.855 --> 39:32.896
Between two
and four thousand men.

39:32.979 --> 39:35.021
(murmuring)

39:35.104 --> 39:38.937
What's really going on here?
How dangerous is this?

39:39.021 --> 39:43.021
There's mild radiation,
but it's limited
to the plant itself.

39:43.104 --> 39:46.187
-Petrov: No, it isn't.
-Excuse me?

39:46.271 --> 39:50.187
You saw men outside vomiting.

39:50.271 --> 39:52.104
You saw men with burns.

39:53.187 --> 39:55.563
There's more radiation
than they're saying.

39:55.646 --> 39:57.937
We have wives here,
we have children.

39:58.021 --> 40:00.730
I say we evacuate the town.

40:00.813 --> 40:02.563
Bryukhanov:
Gentlemen--

40:02.646 --> 40:06.855
Please, please.
My wife is here.

40:06.937 --> 40:08.979
Do you think I would
keep her in Pripyat

40:09.062 --> 40:10.396
if it wasn't safe?

40:10.479 --> 40:14.104
Bryukhanov, the air is glowing.

40:14.187 --> 40:17.229
The Cherenkov effect.
Completely normal phenomenon.

40:17.313 --> 40:19.187
It can happen
with minimal radiation.

40:19.271 --> 40:23.730
-(murmuring)
-(loud tapping)

40:23.813 --> 40:25.979
(murmuring stops)

40:29.605 --> 40:33.646
I wonder how many of you
know the name of this place.

40:35.813 --> 40:39.396
We all call it
"Chernobyl," of course.

40:39.479 --> 40:41.813
What is its real name?

40:43.271 --> 40:46.730
The Vladimir I. Lenin
Nuclear Power Station.

40:46.813 --> 40:48.855
Exactly.

40:50.979 --> 40:54.855
Vladimir I. Lenin.

41:01.979 --> 41:05.688
And how proud he would be
of you all tonight.

41:06.730 --> 41:09.021
Especially you, young man,

41:10.021 --> 41:12.896
and the passion you have
for the people.

41:13.688 --> 41:17.896
For is that not the sole purpose
of the apparatus of the State?

41:19.563 --> 41:21.646
Sometimes, we forget.

41:22.855 --> 41:25.521
Sometimes, we fall prey to fear.

41:27.396 --> 41:31.187
But our faith in
Soviet socialism

41:31.271 --> 41:34.187
will always be rewarded.

41:36.354 --> 41:40.605
Now, the State tells us
the situation here is
not dangerous.

41:40.688 --> 41:43.229
Have faith, comrades.

41:44.855 --> 41:48.313
The State tells us
it wants to prevent a panic.

41:48.396 --> 41:50.605
Listen well.

41:53.062 --> 41:57.271
It's true, when the people see
the police, they will be afraid.

41:58.605 --> 42:00.730
But it is my experience

42:01.896 --> 42:03.979
that when the people
ask questions

42:04.062 --> 42:07.354
that are not in their
own best interest,

42:07.438 --> 42:09.354
they should simply be told

42:09.438 --> 42:11.605
to keep their minds
on their labor

42:12.605 --> 42:17.479
and leave matters
of the State to the State.

42:19.146 --> 42:21.229
We seal off the city.

42:22.396 --> 42:24.062
No one leaves.

42:24.771 --> 42:26.896
And cut the phone lines.

42:26.979 --> 42:29.771
Contain the spread
of misinformation.

42:32.438 --> 42:35.229
That is how we keep the people

42:35.313 --> 42:38.479
from undermining the fruits
of their own labor.

42:41.521 --> 42:43.313
Yes, comrades...

42:44.605 --> 42:48.646
we will all be rewarded
for what we do here tonight.

42:50.979 --> 42:55.479
This is our moment to shine.

43:00.271 --> 43:02.605
(applause continues within)

43:07.646 --> 43:08.855
Thank you.

43:21.313 --> 43:24.313
Comrade Sitnikov to see
the Chief Engineer.

43:37.187 --> 43:38.354
Well?

43:40.313 --> 43:41.855
(clears throat)

43:44.979 --> 43:48.187
I sent my dosimetrists
into the reactor building.

43:49.521 --> 43:50.979
The large dosimeter
from the safe,

43:51.062 --> 43:52.896
the one with
the 1,000-roentgen capacity--

43:52.979 --> 43:54.313
What was the number?

43:57.563 --> 43:58.771
There was none.

43:58.855 --> 44:01.730
The meter burned out
the second it was turned on.

44:02.563 --> 44:04.438
-It's typical.
-See? This is
what Moscow does.

44:04.521 --> 44:07.646
Sends us shit equipment, then
wonders why things go wrong.

44:07.730 --> 44:09.937
We found another dosimeter

44:10.021 --> 44:11.979
from the military
fire department.

44:12.062 --> 44:15.021
It only goes
to 200 roentgen, but it's
better than the small ones.

44:15.104 --> 44:16.229
And?

44:17.479 --> 44:19.354
It maxed out.

44:19.438 --> 44:21.021
Two hundred roentgen.

44:23.521 --> 44:25.605
What game are you playing?

44:25.688 --> 44:27.104
No, I--I--

44:27.187 --> 44:30.813
I asked him, he took
multiple measurements,
he's my best man.

44:30.896 --> 44:33.563
It's another faulty meter.
You're wasting our time.

44:33.646 --> 44:35.396
I checked the meter
against the control.

44:35.479 --> 44:37.730
What's wrong with you?
How'd you get that number

44:37.813 --> 44:40.062
from feedwater leaking
from a blown tank?

44:43.563 --> 44:47.104
-You don't.
-Then what the fuck
are you talking about?

44:51.229 --> 44:53.104
I, um...
(clears throat)

44:54.937 --> 44:58.438
I walked around
the exterior of Building 4.

44:59.479 --> 45:02.937
I think there's graphite
on the ground in the rubble.

45:03.937 --> 45:05.730
You didn't see graphite.

45:06.646 --> 45:08.563
-I did.
-You didn't.

45:09.479 --> 45:13.271
You didn't!
Because it's not there!

45:14.146 --> 45:15.771
What?

45:15.855 --> 45:19.354
Are you suggesting
the core... what?

45:19.438 --> 45:21.605
Exploded?

45:23.271 --> 45:24.605
Yes.

45:33.021 --> 45:34.313
Sitnikov.

45:35.563 --> 45:38.104
You're a nuclear
engineer, so am I.

45:38.187 --> 45:44.396
Please tell me how an RBMK
reactor core explodes.

45:44.479 --> 45:48.146
Not a meltdown, an explosion.

45:48.229 --> 45:49.979
I'd love to know.

45:51.146 --> 45:52.479
I can't.

45:53.354 --> 45:54.855
Are you stupid?

45:55.979 --> 45:58.771
-No.
-Then why can't you?

46:00.104 --> 46:01.688
I... (stammers)

46:03.646 --> 46:06.271
I don't see how
it could explode.

46:08.646 --> 46:10.396
-But it did.
-Dyatlov: Enough!

46:10.479 --> 46:12.271
I'll go up
to the vent block roof.

46:12.354 --> 46:15.730
From there you can look right
down into reactor Building 4.

46:15.813 --> 46:19.479
I'll see it with my own...
my own eyes.

46:19.563 --> 46:22.187
(vomiting)

46:25.730 --> 46:27.313
I apologize.

46:28.813 --> 46:30.563
Guards! Guards!

46:31.521 --> 46:34.855
Get him to the medic
or the hospital!
Whatever he needs!

46:42.187 --> 46:44.313
(groaning)

46:50.937 --> 46:54.187
It's the feedwater.
Been around it all night.

46:56.563 --> 46:57.896
You go then.

47:00.896 --> 47:02.396
What?

47:02.479 --> 47:06.855
-Go to the vent block roof
and report back what you see.
-No.

47:10.438 --> 47:14.271
-No, I won't do that.
-Of course you will.

47:19.396 --> 47:22.730
You'll be fine. You'll see.

47:24.062 --> 47:25.563
Come on.

47:41.104 --> 47:43.146
(sloshing)

48:06.896 --> 48:08.271
Okay.

48:09.937 --> 48:11.438

I'm sorry.

48:49.937 --> 48:51.813
(crying)

48:52.813 --> 48:54.730
There's nothing
to be sorry for.

48:54.813 --> 48:58.146
I told you,
we did nothing wrong.

49:00.688 --> 49:02.187

Hello?

52:51.479 --> 52:53.187

-Yes.

52:53.271 --> 52:55.813
You are the Legasov who is
the First Deputy Director

52:55.896 --> 52:58.396

52:58.479 --> 53:00.979

Deputy Chairman of
the Council of Ministers

53:03.146 --> 53:05.771
and head of the Bureau
for Fuel and Energy.

53:05.855 --> 53:10.605
There's been an accident
at the Chernobyl Nuclear
Power Plant.

53:10.688 --> 53:11.855
How bad is it?

53:11.937 --> 53:14.104
No. No need to panic.
There was a fire.

53:14.187 --> 53:17.146
It's mostly put out.
The system control
tank exploded.

53:17.229 --> 53:20.771
Control system tank.
And the core?

53:20.855 --> 53:24.021
We've ordered them to
continuously pump water.

53:24.104 --> 53:26.771
Yes, I see.
Any contamination?

53:26.855 --> 53:29.688
It's mild. The plant manager,
Bryukhanov, is reporting

53:29.771 --> 53:31.271
3.6 roentgen per hour.

53:31.354 --> 53:33.521
That's actually significant.
You should evacuate the sur--

53:33.605 --> 53:38.021
You're an expert on
RBMK reactors, correct?

53:38.104 --> 53:42.313
-Yes, I've studied--
-General Secretary Gorbachev
has appointed a committee

53:42.396 --> 53:46.021
to manage the accident.
You're on it.

53:46.104 --> 53:48.271
We'll convene
at two this afternoon.

53:48.354 --> 53:51.438
That late? Forgive me,
but don't you think

53:51.521 --> 53:53.271
given the amount of radiation
that it would be--

53:53.354 --> 53:56.146
Legasov, you're on this
committee to answer
direct questions

53:56.229 --> 53:59.062
about the function
of an RBMK reactor

53:59.146 --> 54:02.104
if they should happen
to arise. Nothing else.

54:02.187 --> 54:04.896
Certainly not policy.
Do you understand?

54:04.979 --> 54:07.896
-Yes, of course.
I didn't mean to--

in Chernobyl is stable.

In terms of radiation,

I'm told it's the equivalent
of a chest X-ray.

59:11.438 --> 59:12.313
No!

59:12.771 --> 59:15.104
The fire is giving off
nearly twice the radiation

59:15.187 --> 59:16.979
released by the bomb
in Hiroshima.

59:18.062 --> 59:19.563
It will burn
and spread its poison

59:19.646 --> 59:21.855
until the entire continent
is dead.
