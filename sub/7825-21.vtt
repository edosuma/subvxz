Would you turn off

01:22.610 --> 01:24.380
Hey, don't have
a stegosaurus, man.

01:24.450 --> 01:26.720
( <i>laughing )</i>

01:26.780 --> 01:28.690
THESE TALKING DINOSAURS
ARE MORE REAL

01:28.750 --> 01:30.360

OOH! OOH! OOH..!

LOOK, MAGGIE,
THEY HAVE A BABY TOO.

01:35.660 --> 01:38.930
IT'S LIKE THEY SAW OUR LIVES

01:38.990 --> 01:41.120
NOW KIDS, I KNOW
YOU'RE ALL EXCITED

01:41.200 --> 01:43.270

BEFORE HE GETS HERE

01:45.830 --> 01:47.500
I SHOULD TELL YOU
SOMETHING ABOUT HIM--

SOMETHING <i>DISTURBING.</i>

01:50.640 --> 01:52.310
OOH!

YOU SEE, AUNT SELMA HAS
THIS CRAZY OBSESSION

01:58.810 --> 02:00.040

02:00.120 --> 02:01.550
SO IN DESPERATION

02:01.620 --> 02:04.060
SHE JOINED THIS PRISON
PEN PAL PROGRAM.

02:04.120 --> 02:06.060
HER NEW SWEETIE

02:06.120 --> 02:07.960
<i>COOL, HE CAN TEACH US</i>

02:08.020 --> 02:09.780
HOW TO KILL A MAN
WITH A LUNCH TRAY.

02:09.860 --> 02:13.230
NOW, NOW, HE'S
AN <i>EX-CONVICT.</i>

02:13.300 --> 02:15.030
HE'S PAID HIS DEBT
TO SOCIETY.

02:15.100 --> 02:16.500
THEN HOW COME
YOU'RE NOT USING

02:16.570 --> 02:18.100
THE GOOD SILVERWARE?

02:18.170 --> 02:19.070
I'M JUST NOT.

02:20.000 --> 02:20.770
THAT'S THEM.

02:33.480 --> 02:34.750
SELMA, DEAR, I'M AFRAID
THE CHILDREN'S REACTION

02:34.820 --> 02:36.450
IS QUITE UNDERSTANDABLE.

02:36.520 --> 02:38.160
YOU SEE, BART HERE
IS THE SHAMUS
IN SHORT PANTS

02:38.220 --> 02:39.260
WHO SENT ME
TO PRISON.

02:39.320 --> 02:40.690
THAT'S RIGHT, AUNT SELMA.

02:40.760 --> 02:42.930
YOUR NEW BOYFRIEND HERE
FRAMED KRUSTY THE CLOWN

02:42.990 --> 02:44.260
FOR ARMED ROBBERY.

02:44.330 --> 02:45.800
( <i>gasp )</i>

02:45.860 --> 02:48.500
GEE, IF SOME SNOT-NOSED
LITTLE KID SENT ME TO PRISON,

02:48.560 --> 02:50.860
THE FIRST THING OUT
I'D FIND OUT WHERE HE LIVES

02:50.930 --> 02:53.130
AND TEAR HIM
A NEW BELLY-BUTTON.

02:59.840 --> 03:01.380
AH, MR. SIMPSON.

03:01.440 --> 03:03.400
YOU'RE FORGETTING
THE FIRST TWO NOBLE TRUTHS

03:03.480 --> 03:04.250
OF THE BUDDHA.

03:04.310 --> 03:04.940
I AM NOT.

03:05.010 --> 03:06.070
YES, YOU ARE.

03:06.150 --> 03:08.590
ONE:
EXISTENCE IS SUFFERING.

03:08.650 --> 03:11.790
TWO: THE CAUSE
OF SUFFERING IS DESIRE--

03:11.850 --> 03:14.080
IN THIS CASE, MY DESIRE
TO DO HIGH-QUALITY

03:14.160 --> 03:15.130
CHILDREN'S PROGRAMMING.

03:17.090 --> 03:18.250
<i>WHEN PRISON PUT AN END

03:18.330 --> 03:19.800
<i>I BECAME A SEETHING CAULDRON</i>

UH, NOW FOR THE HIGHLIGHT
OF THE EVENING--

04:25.590 --> 04:27.020
BEST FILM-TO-VIDEO TRANSFER.

04:28.460 --> 04:29.960
DO YOU KNOW
WHAT PRISON IS LIKE

04:30.030 --> 04:31.900
FOR A LIFE-LONG,

04:35.870 --> 04:37.240

OH, I DID.

04:41.740 --> 04:42.670
HERE YOU GO.

04:58.060 --> 04:59.500
BART, IF I
WANTED TO KILL YOU

04:59.560 --> 05:01.100
I'D HAVE CHOKED YOU
LIKE A CHICKEN

05:01.160 --> 05:02.320
AS SOON AS I WALKED IN

05:02.400 --> 05:03.400

AH, YES-- MY LOWEST EBB.

05:12.980 --> 05:14.950
YOU CAN'T TAKE
MY EMMY.

05:15.010 --> 05:16.610
YOU KNOW THE RULES:

NOT EVEN
A GOLDEN GLOBE.

BUT KISMET CAN BE KIND,

09:48.470 --> 09:50.400
Hey, if they ever open
the books on this telethon

09:50.470 --> 09:51.370
I'm right back in there.

09:52.670 --> 09:55.540
THAT SIDESHOW BOB IS
A NO-GOOD SHOW BIZ PHONY.

09:55.610 --> 09:56.940
COME ON, BART.

09:57.010 --> 09:59.010
IF KRUSTY CAN FIND IT
IN HIS HEART TO FORGIVE HIM

09:59.080 --> 10:01.150
SURELY YOU CAN TOO.

10:01.210 --> 10:02.510
Oh, Krusty,
I can't tell you

10:02.580 --> 10:04.590
how much I missed this.

10:04.650 --> 10:05.790
Ha-ha!

10:05.850 --> 10:07.090
Marge:
<i>NOW, ABOUT</i>

10:07.150 --> 10:08.390
YOUR
WEDDING DRESS...

10:08.450 --> 10:10.180
I'M NOT SURE
HOW TO PUT THIS...

10:10.260 --> 10:11.090
WHITE!

10:11.160 --> 10:12.490
WHITE.

10:12.560 --> 10:14.230
AND WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE
FOR APPETIZERS?

10:14.290 --> 10:15.820
OOH, APPETIZERS.

10:15.890 --> 10:17.590
WELL, HOMER, YOU SEEM TO BE
A TRENCHERMAN.

10:17.660 --> 10:19.090
WHAT SHOULD WE SERVE?

10:19.160 --> 10:22.490
WELL, YOU CAN'T GO WRONG
WITH COCKTAIL WEENIES.

10:22.570 --> 10:24.510
THEY TASTE AS GOOD
AS THEY LOOK

10:24.570 --> 10:26.740
AND THEY COME IN THIS
DELICIOUS RED SAUCE.

10:26.810 --> 10:29.380
IT LOOKS LIKE KETCHUP,
IT TASTES LIKE KETCHUP

10:29.440 --> 10:32.210
BUT, BROTHER, IT AIN'T KETCHUP!

10:32.280 --> 10:33.950
WELL, SELMA,
HE MAKES A GOOD CASE.

10:34.010 --> 10:35.320
GET WHATEVER YOU WANT.

10:35.380 --> 10:37.250
IT ALL TASTES
LIKE STYROFOAM TO ME.

10:37.320 --> 10:39.790
SELMA, DEAR, I'M CONFUSED.

10:39.850 --> 10:41.290
WELL, WHEN I WAS A KID

10:41.350 --> 10:43.150
WE WERE PLAYING
WITH BOTTLE ROCKETS

10:43.220 --> 10:45.460
AND ONE SHOT
STRAIGHT UP MY NOSE.

10:45.520 --> 10:48.790
I PERMANENTLY LOST MY SENSE
OF TASTE AND SMELL.

10:48.860 --> 10:52.800
OKAY, WE'VE GOT COCKTAIL WEENIES
AND SWEDISH MEATBALLS.

10:52.860 --> 10:54.930
SELMA, THIS WEDDING IS SPINNING
OUT OF CONTROL.

10:55.000 --> 10:56.570
CAN WE REALLY AFFORD IT?

10:56.640 --> 10:58.410
I'VE ALREADY RUN THROUGH
EIGHT OF THE TEN DOLLARS

10:58.470 --> 10:59.770
THEY GAVE ME
WHEN I LEFT PRISON.

10:59.840 --> 11:02.040
HEY, RELAX.
I TOLD YOU I GOT MONEY.

11:02.110 --> 11:04.010
I BOUGHT STOCK
IN A MACE COMPANY

11:04.080 --> 11:06.110
JUST BEFORE
SOCIETY CRUMBLED.

11:06.180 --> 11:08.350
SELMA, THAT'S WONDERFUL!

11:08.410 --> 11:09.740
I JUST HOPE PEOPLE
DON'T THINK

11:09.810 --> 11:11.740
I'M MARRYING YOU
FOR YOUR MONEY

11:11.820 --> 11:14.960
INSTEAD OF YOUR...
LESS TANGIBLE QUALITIES.

11:16.790 --> 11:20.430
TOMORROW WE'LL BE
MR. AND MRS. BOB TERWILLIGER.

11:20.490 --> 11:21.630
ISN'T IT GRAND?

11:21.690 --> 11:24.820
HEY, BOB, GIVE SOME
OF THAT HONEY THIS WAY.

11:24.900 --> 11:27.740
MMM... MMM!

11:27.800 --> 11:29.470
HOLY FRIJOLES!

11:29.530 --> 11:30.960
WE'VE GOT TEN MINUTES
TILL <i>MacGYVER.</i>

11:31.040 --> 11:32.140
DRIVER, HERE'S A FIN.

11:32.200 --> 11:33.430
GET ME HOME,
AND DON'T SPARE THE WHIP.

11:33.510 --> 11:34.840
WHATEVER YOU SAY, MUM.

11:34.910 --> 11:36.040
( <i>belches )</i>

11:36.110 --> 11:37.240
( <i>door slams )</i>

11:37.310 --> 11:38.150
WHAT DID I MISS?

11:38.210 --> 11:40.980
MacGYVER WAS WEARING A TANK TOP.

11:41.050 --> 11:42.350
DANG.

11:42.410 --> 11:44.340
WHY, SELMA, I THOUGHT I WAS
THE ONLY MAN IN YOUR LIFE.

11:44.420 --> 11:46.450
SIT DOWN AND SHUT UP!

11:46.520 --> 11:49.420
Man:
Thank you, SeÃ±or MacGyver,
you saved our village.

11:49.490 --> 11:50.490
MacGyver:
Don't thank me.

11:50.560 --> 11:52.090
Thank the moon's
gravitational pull.

11:56.590 --> 11:59.190
THAT MacGYVER'S
A GENIUS.

11:59.260 --> 12:00.930
FIRST OF ALL,
HE'S NOT A GENIUS.

12:01.000 --> 12:02.400
HE'S AN ACTOR.

12:02.470 --> 12:04.210
AND SECOND:
HE'S NOT MUCH OF AN ACTOR.

12:04.270 --> 12:05.040
YOU'RE LYING.

12:05.100 --> 12:06.500
YOU'RE LYING!

12:06.570 --> 12:08.580
NO, SELMA, <i>THIS IS LYING:</i>

12:08.640 --> 12:11.210
THAT WAS A WELL-PLOTTED PIECE
OF NON-CLAPTRAP

12:11.280 --> 12:12.550
THAT NEVER MADE ME
WANT TO RETCH.

12:12.610 --> 12:13.880
NO!

12:13.950 --> 12:14.950
( <i>crying )</i>

12:18.450 --> 12:20.620
HE WAS SO CRUEL.

12:20.690 --> 12:22.660
THE THINGS HE SAID--

12:22.720 --> 12:24.830
THEY'RE JUST NOT TRUE.

12:24.890 --> 12:26.960
THERE, THERE.

12:27.030 --> 12:28.530
OH, WELL, I GUESS
THE WEDDING'S OFF.

12:28.590 --> 12:30.150
FIDDLE-DEE-DEE.
TOMORROW'S ANOTHER DAY.

12:30.230 --> 12:31.400
BART, STOP THAT!

12:31.460 --> 12:33.260
NO, HE'S RIGHT.

12:33.330 --> 12:34.700
WE'RE A PACKAGE.

12:34.770 --> 12:37.400
LOVE ME, LOVE <i>MacGYVER.</i>

12:37.470 --> 12:39.010
I GUESS THE WEDDING'S OFF.

12:41.370 --> 12:43.200
SELMA, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY.

12:43.270 --> 12:45.140
JUST TELL ME
YOU LIKE <i>MacGYVER.</i>

12:45.210 --> 12:46.410
VERY WELL.

12:46.480 --> 12:49.420
I... I...

12:49.480 --> 12:50.680
I CAN'T DO IT!

12:50.750 --> 12:52.520
EVEN THAT CAR CHASE
SEEMED TACKED ON.

12:52.580 --> 12:54.350
( <i>sobbing )</i>

12:54.420 --> 12:57.090
OH, WOULD YOU TWO KNOCK IT OFF?

12:57.160 --> 12:59.160
I HATE ALL THE PROGRAMS
MARGE LIKES

12:59.220 --> 13:00.520
BUT IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

13:00.590 --> 13:01.660
YOU KNOW WHY?

13:01.730 --> 13:02.600
NO.
GO ON.

13:02.660 --> 13:03.830
WHENEVER MARGE PUTS ON

13:03.900 --> 13:07.300
ONE OF HER NONVIOLENT PROGRAMS,
I TAKE A WALK.

13:07.370 --> 13:09.500
I GO TO A BAR, I POUND A FEW,

13:09.570 --> 13:12.740
THEN I STUMBLE HOME
IN THE MOOD FOR LOVE.

13:12.800 --> 13:14.500
VERY WELL, SELMA.

13:14.570 --> 13:15.770
WHENEVER YOU
WATCH <i>MacGYVER</i>

13:15.840 --> 13:18.050
I'LL TAKE
A VIGOROUS CONSTITUTIONAL

13:18.110 --> 13:20.350
AND RETURN MORE IN LOVE
WITH YOU THAN EVER.

13:20.410 --> 13:22.050
OH, BOB.

13:22.110 --> 13:23.370
BART NO LIKE.

13:23.450 --> 13:24.890
BAD MEDICINE.

13:24.950 --> 13:27.960
( <i>organ playing
"The Wedding March" )</i>

13:28.020 --> 13:29.690
I COULD HAVE BEEN
THE FLOWER GIRL

13:29.750 --> 13:32.120
AND I WOULDN'T KEEP
FALLING DOWN EITHER.

13:32.190 --> 13:34.230
HEY, THEY CHOSE MAGGIE,
OKAY?

13:34.290 --> 13:35.890
YEAH, WELL, IF YOU WANT TO GO
FOR CUTESYNESS

13:35.960 --> 13:38.100
INSTEAD OF COMPETENCE, FINE.

13:38.160 --> 13:40.320
DO YOU, BOB, TAKE SELMA

13:40.400 --> 13:43.840
TO HAVE AND TO HOLD,
IN SICKNESS AND IN HEALTH

13:43.900 --> 13:45.410
TILL DEATH
DO YOU PART?

13:47.310 --> 13:48.410
( <i>gruesome-voiced: )

I'M THE ONLY SINGLE GIRL
LEFT IN THE FAMILY.

14:14.470 --> 14:16.470
WELL, I GUESS
IT COULD BE WORSE.

14:16.530 --> 14:18.300
OH, THERE'S
KRUSTY THE CLOWN.

14:18.370 --> 14:19.410
KRUSTY!

14:19.470 --> 14:21.040
KRUSTY, SAY
SOMETHING FUNNY.

14:21.110 --> 14:22.680
OH, GEE, A JOKE, HUH?

14:22.740 --> 14:25.850
UM... UH... FUNNY...

14:25.910 --> 14:27.680
OKAY, THIS GUY WALKS INTO A BAR

AND A 12-INCH PIANIST...

14:30.820 --> 14:31.750
OH, NO, WAIT.

14:31.820 --> 14:33.820
I CAN'T TELL THAT ONE.

14:33.890 --> 14:36.920
DEAR FRIENDS, 41 YEARS AGO

14:36.990 --> 14:41.800
GOD TOOK 168 POUNDS OF CLAY,
AND HE MADE ME A WOMAN

14:41.860 --> 14:44.200
AND FOR THIS,
I THANK HIM.

14:44.260 --> 14:45.800
I JUST WANTED TO SAY

14:45.860 --> 14:48.430
ON THE ADVICE
OF MY NEW HUSBAND

14:48.500 --> 14:50.670
I'VE DECIDED
TO GIVE UP SMOKING...

YOU DON'T TRUST
SIDESHOW BOB, DO YOU?

15:02.680 --> 15:04.750
LIGHTEN UP, SON.

15:04.820 --> 15:06.550
IF HE WAS GOING
TO COMMIT A CRIME

15:06.620 --> 15:09.690
WOULD HE HAVE INVITED
THE NUMBER-ONE COP IN TOWN?

15:09.750 --> 15:11.620
NOW, WHERE DID I PUT MY GUN?

15:11.690 --> 15:12.930
OH, YEAH.

15:12.990 --> 15:15.500
I SET IT DOWN WHEN I GOT
A PIECE OF CAKE.

KNOW I WANT TO HEAR.

VERY TOUGH ON YOU

cousin Doug gave us

16:01.260 --> 16:04.090

Homer gave us.

WE CAN TAPE OVER IT.

There's Shelbyville Falls,
Rolling Rock,

16:12.000 --> 16:14.440
and here's another
breathtaking sight--

16:14.500 --> 16:17.200
my brand-new hubby.

16:17.270 --> 16:19.280

Oh, Selma, dear.

I was just chatting
with my good friend... Dennis.

Oh, Selma, dear--
you and your little camera.

What do you say we
shut it off for a while?

16:46.070 --> 16:47.340
And make love?

16:49.300 --> 16:50.630
I suppose so.

16:50.710 --> 16:53.180
Marge:
OH, THAT'S SWEET.

16:53.240 --> 16:56.550
WHY WOULD SIDESHOW BOB
GO SO NUTS OVER A FIREPLACE?

16:56.610 --> 16:58.750
BECAUSE HE WANTS
HIS HONEYMOON

16:58.810 --> 17:00.240
TO BE ROMANTIC.

ROMANTIC? WITH AUNT SELMA?

A TERRIBLE ACCIDENT IN MY ROOM!

18:48.390 --> 18:49.530
( <i>glass crunching )</i>

18:51.760 --> 18:54.200
POOR SELMA-- YOU WERE HAVING

18:54.260 --> 18:55.730
SUCH A LOVELY EVENING

18:55.800 --> 18:57.870
â™ª ...AND THEN I WENT
AND SPOILED IT ALL â™ª

18:57.930 --> 19:02.200
â™ª BY DOING SOMETHING STUPID
LIKE EXPLODE YOU. â™ª

19:02.270 --> 19:04.510
SIDESHOW BOB, I'M AFRAID
THE ONLY VICTIMS HERE

19:04.570 --> 19:06.970
ARE THE GOOD PEOPLE
AT BEST WESTERN HOTELS.

19:07.040 --> 19:07.610
BART!

19:09.340 --> 19:09.870
SELMA!

19:11.010 --> 19:11.720
OH!

19:11.780 --> 19:12.880
YOU TRIED TO KILL ME.

19:12.950 --> 19:14.480
I WANT A SEPARATION.

19:16.680 --> 19:19.180
MY BEST-LAID PLANS
HAVE <i>GANG AGLEY.</i>

19:19.250 --> 19:20.880
CHIEF WIGGUM, THINK YOU HAVE
ROOM IN YOUR JAIL

19:20.960 --> 19:22.690
FOR A TWO-TIME LOSER?

19:22.760 --> 19:24.700
WELL, NO, FRANKLY,
BUT THAT NEVER
STOPPED US BEFORE.

19:26.960 --> 19:27.970
BART, I MUST KNOW

19:28.030 --> 19:29.730
HOW DID YOU UNTANGLE MY WEB?

19:29.800 --> 19:31.230
YEAH, BART, CLUE US IN.

19:31.300 --> 19:33.800
WELL, I'D HATE TO TELL
THE NUMBER-ONE COP IN TOWN

19:33.870 --> 19:35.240
HOW TO DO HIS JOB.

19:35.300 --> 19:37.600
NO, PLEASE, IT'S
THE ONLY WAY I'LL LEARN.

19:37.670 --> 19:39.110
ALL RIGHT.

19:39.170 --> 19:40.630
<i>SIDESHOW BOB SEEMED
SO DESPERATE</i>

19:40.710 --> 19:42.880
<i>TO GET THAT FIREPLACE, BUT WHY?</i>

19:42.940 --> 19:44.370
<i>THEN IT HIT ME--</i>

19:44.450 --> 19:45.820
<i>THE GAS!</i>

19:45.880 --> 19:48.250
<i>SURELY ANYONE
WOULD HAVE NOTICED A GAS LEAK</i>

19:48.320 --> 19:51.290
<i>EXCEPT AUNT SELMA.</i>

19:51.350 --> 19:54.580
Selma:
<i>I PERMANENTLY LOST MY SENSE
OF TASTE AND SMELL.</i>

19:54.660 --> 19:55.960
Bart:
<i>SHE HAPPILY WATCHED
HER MacGYVER</i>

19:56.020 --> 19:57.180
<i>UNAWARE THAT HER ROOM</i>

19:57.260 --> 19:59.900
<i>WAS SILENTLY FILLING
WITH NATURAL GAS.</i>

19:59.960 --> 20:01.470
<i>ALL IT NEEDED TO EXPLODE</i>

20:01.530 --> 20:05.570
<i>WAS A SINGLE SPARK,
SAY, FROM A CIGARETTE.</i>

20:05.630 --> 20:06.330
Selma:
<i>I'VE DECIDED</i>

20:06.400 --> 20:07.940
<i>TO GIVE UP SMOKING</i>

20:08.000 --> 20:10.030
<i>EXCEPT FOR AFTER MEALS
AND AFTER MacGYVER.</i>

20:10.100 --> 20:11.700
Bart:
<i>HER ONLY HOPE WAS
A PLUCKY YOUNG BOY</i>

20:11.770 --> 20:13.670
<i>AND HIS SLOW-WITTED FATHER.</i>

20:13.740 --> 20:15.750
DAD, WHEN AUNT SELMA
LIGHTS UP HER CIGARETTE

20:15.810 --> 20:16.880
AT THE END OF <i>MacGYVER</i>

20:16.940 --> 20:18.470
SHE'LL BE BLOWN
TO KINGDOM COME.

20:18.550 --> 20:19.250
COME AGAIN?

20:21.780 --> 20:23.180
<i>AFTER TRYING FOUR TIMES</i>

20:23.250 --> 20:25.220
<i>TO EXPLAIN IT TO HOMER,
I EXPLAINED IT TO MOM</i>

20:25.290 --> 20:26.820
<i>AND WE WERE ON OUR WAY!</i>

20:26.890 --> 20:27.920
TO THE SIMPSON-MOBILE!

20:29.960 --> 20:30.690
( <i>tires squealing )</i>

20:45.810 --> 20:46.910
NOOO!!

20:50.650 --> 20:53.480
BUT WAIT, IF YOU SAVED SELMA,
WHY DID THE ROOM EXPLODE?

20:53.550 --> 20:55.720
OH, I'LL FIELD THAT ONE.

20:55.780 --> 20:57.780
<i>ME AND THE BOYS
WERE ALL CELEBRATING
A JOB WELL DONE</i>

20:57.850 --> 20:59.220
<i>WHEN I THREW MY MATCH</i>

20:59.290 --> 21:00.620
<i>IN THE VICINITY
OF THE CRIME SCENE.</i>

21:03.120 --> 21:05.150
OH, RIGHT-- THE GAS.

21:05.230 --> 21:06.400
I'LL BE BACK.

21:06.460 --> 21:07.630
YOU CAN'T KEEP THE DEMOCRATS

21:07.700 --> 21:09.070
OUT OF THE WHITE HOUSE FOREVER

21:09.130 --> 21:11.440
AND WHEN THEY GET IN,
I'M BACK ON THE STREETS

21:11.500 --> 21:13.300
WITH ALL MY CRIMINAL BUDDIES!

21:13.370 --> 21:15.510
( <i>maniacal laughter )</i>

21:19.440 --> 21:22.180
I FEEL LIKE SUCH A FOOL.

21:22.240 --> 21:23.900
WELL, HE FOOLED
ALMOST EVERYONE

21:23.980 --> 21:28.050
BUT THERE WAS ONE LITTLE BOY
WHO NEVER LOST HIS MISTRUST.

21:28.120 --> 21:30.150
THANKS, MOM.

21:30.220 --> 21:32.090
NOW, LET'S GET OUT
OF THIS GAS-FILLED HALLWAY
