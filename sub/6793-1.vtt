00:54.721 --> 00:57.645
I don't know how you talked
me into this, Tommy.

00:59.017 --> 01:01.395
Hell, I must be crazy, heh.

01:02.104 --> 01:03.697
You know...

01:03.855 --> 01:06.449
if the institution ever
found out about this...

01:06.608 --> 01:09.703
they would haul our butts
back in in straitjackets.

01:09.861 --> 01:12.159
- Permanent.
- You didn't have to come, Hawes.

01:12.322 --> 01:16.043
- This is between me and Jason.
- I know, I know, I know.

01:16.201 --> 01:18.920
But I still don't get
the therapy here.

01:19.079 --> 01:21.798
All you need to know is
Jason's dead, right, heh?

01:21.957 --> 01:25.552
Seeing his corpse ain't gonna
stop the hallucinations.

01:25.711 --> 01:28.214
Seeing it won't,
but destroying it will.

01:29.214 --> 01:33.344
Jason belongs in hell, and
I'm gonna see he gets there.

02:35.864 --> 02:38.367
Okay, there it is, huh, heh?

02:39.451 --> 02:41.670
There's his grave.

02:46.583 --> 02:49.962
- Okay, let's go.
- Wait a second.

02:50.128 --> 02:52.096
What?

02:52.631 --> 02:53.928
I gotta be sure.

03:35.257 --> 03:40.434
Okay. There's your proof.
There's his coffin. Let's go.

03:41.680 --> 03:44.809
- Hand me the crowbar.
- You're not gonna open that.

03:44.975 --> 03:47.319
Hand me the crowbar.

03:49.020 --> 03:51.148
I got it.

03:51.690 --> 03:53.033
I really don't like this.

04:56.421 --> 04:58.719
<i>Die!</i>

04:59.591 --> 05:02.435
<i>- Die!
- Tommy!</i>

05:03.637 --> 05:05.639
<i>Die!</i>

05:05.806 --> 05:08.730
<i>- Tommy!
- Die!</i>

05:10.310 --> 05:14.611
<i>Tommy. Tommy, get the
hell out of here!</i>

05:17.651 --> 05:19.153
Where are you going?

05:22.906 --> 05:24.453
Hey, what's that for?

05:24.616 --> 05:26.459
Tommy, what are you doing?

05:28.787 --> 05:30.255
Oh, shit.

05:50.350 --> 05:52.773
Oh, boy.

05:53.103 --> 05:55.151
He must've really messed you over.

06:01.236 --> 06:03.830
Yeah, fuck you, Jason.

06:42.360 --> 06:44.454
What are you doing?

06:46.197 --> 06:50.703
Tommy. Would you just
leave that thing alone?

06:51.369 --> 06:53.542
Please.

07:03.048 --> 07:07.474
Tommy, please. Let's get out of here.
My heart can't take any more of this.

08:15.912 --> 08:17.129
Hawes!

10:21.246 --> 10:24.500
- Don't shoot. Please.
- You in show business, kid?

10:24.666 --> 10:27.840
- You sure know how to make an entrance.
- Look, you gotta do something.

10:28.002 --> 10:29.588
Jason's alive. He killed my friend,

10:29.614 --> 10:31.637
- now he's coming for me.
- You better cool out, boy.

10:31.663 --> 10:33.856
- You almost got your head blown off.
- Will you listen, dammit?

10:33.882 --> 10:37.779
Don't piss me off, junior or I will
repaint this office with your brains.

10:37.805 --> 10:40.902
Look, Jason is alive.
We dug up his body.

10:40.928 --> 10:44.895
- I was gonna cremate it.
- Hold it. What's your name, son?

10:45.061 --> 10:47.029
Tommy Jarvis. But look,
we've gotta do something.

10:47.188 --> 10:48.565
He's even more powerful now...

10:48.773 --> 10:51.151
Aren't you the kid whose mother and
friends were killed by that maniac?

10:51.317 --> 10:52.614
Yeah. Jason murdered them.

10:52.777 --> 10:54.779
You've been in some
psychiatric clinic ever since.

10:56.364 --> 10:58.044
What the hell's going
on with the weather?

10:58.199 --> 11:00.952
- Sorry. I didn't know you had...
- No problem, Rick.

11:01.119 --> 11:03.713
I want you to meet a former
resident here, Tommy Jarvis.

11:03.872 --> 11:06.593
- He's got some kind of prank...
- There's no time for this bullshit!

11:06.666 --> 11:08.714
- Jason's gotta be stopped!
- What prank, Mike?

11:08.877 --> 11:11.096
- Hey. Hey!
- Unh!

11:11.254 --> 11:14.271
That's what's known in the books as
"screwing the pooch." Iron this punk.

11:14.297 --> 11:18.307
No, wait. You gotta listen to me.
Jason's coming here. He's after me!

11:18.469 --> 11:21.598
- I tried to destroy him, but I fucked up.
- You got that right, punk.

11:21.764 --> 11:25.151
You listen to me. I'm sorry about what
happened to you and your folks years ago...

11:25.310 --> 11:27.433
but no one in Forest Green
wants to be reminded...

11:27.496 --> 11:30.615
of what that maniac did here.
That's why we changed the name.

11:30.773 --> 11:32.741
People wanna forget
this was Crystal Lake.

11:32.901 --> 11:35.404
They don't need some kid
stirring up Jason shit again.

11:35.570 --> 11:37.664
Now, you just lie down
and get some rest.

11:37.822 --> 11:39.916
- In the morning, I'll call that clinic.
- No.

11:40.116 --> 11:42.915
If you just go to the cemetery,
you'll see I'm not lying.

11:43.077 --> 11:46.832
Either you get some sleep, or I'm
gonna come in there and put you out.

11:46.998 --> 11:49.217
You're gonna be sorry
you didn't listen to me.

11:49.375 --> 11:51.257
You're gonna be sorry
if you don't shut up.

11:51.583 --> 11:53.547
Take a nap, junior.

12:15.193 --> 12:17.241
Take it easy. It's hard
enough to read this thing.

12:17.403 --> 12:20.623
- Well, who told me to take this cowpath?
- Wait a minute.

12:20.782 --> 12:24.744
You admit the sign did say Camp Forest
Green with an arrow pointing this way?

12:24.911 --> 12:27.255
I admit nothing without
talking to my lawyer.

12:27.413 --> 12:29.493
I told you we should've left
a trail of bread crumbs.

12:29.514 --> 12:30.612
Don't start.

12:32.293 --> 12:35.843
So much for the head counselors ever
getting back to the camp on their own.

12:36.005 --> 12:39.009
I say we stop the car, get out
and start screaming for help.

12:40.802 --> 12:44.807
- I was just kidding, Lizbeth.
- Darren, we'd better turn around.

12:44.973 --> 12:46.646
- Why?
- Because I've seen enough...

12:46.808 --> 12:50.403
horror movies to know any weirdo
wearing a mask is never friendly.

12:59.404 --> 13:00.997
Whoa!

13:01.614 --> 13:03.457
There's no way that we can do this.

13:03.616 --> 13:06.244
If the car drops into that
gully, we'll never get it out.

13:06.411 --> 13:08.379
Do you have a better suggestion?

13:10.164 --> 13:11.962
Yeah.

13:12.250 --> 13:13.797
We're gonna scare him.

13:13.960 --> 13:15.803
- We're gonna scare him?
- That's right.

13:15.962 --> 13:17.714
Just drive towards him. He'll move.

13:17.880 --> 13:20.258
- Nobody wants to die.
- Well, that's a freaking fact.

13:20.425 --> 13:21.665
- Least of all us.
- Just drive.

13:23.011 --> 13:24.058
He'll get out of our way.

13:37.442 --> 13:40.742
Yeah. That really scared
the shit out of him.

13:46.868 --> 13:48.370
- Oh, no.
- That's it.

13:48.536 --> 13:50.709
We're driving this baby
back to town in reverse.

13:50.872 --> 13:51.998
The hell we are.

13:55.084 --> 13:57.132
- Where'd you get that?
- Don't worry about it.

13:57.295 --> 13:59.468
- Just stay cool.
- Stay cool?

13:59.630 --> 14:02.474
You ain't Dirty Harry.
Now, stop it.

14:07.680 --> 14:12.060
All right, scumbag.
Get out of the road.

14:12.810 --> 14:14.107
Now.

14:15.438 --> 14:17.861
Darren, get back in here
right now. He'll kill you.

14:21.694 --> 14:22.991
Not if I get him first.

14:29.035 --> 14:30.378
No, no.

14:43.174 --> 14:44.767
No!

14:46.928 --> 14:48.180
Please.

14:49.055 --> 14:52.104
Please, wait a second.

14:52.266 --> 14:54.860
Please. Take these...

14:55.019 --> 14:56.942
Please.

14:57.688 --> 14:59.986
You can have the...

15:39.605 --> 15:42.028
Come on, Dad. You can at
least have Rick drive out...

15:42.191 --> 15:43.238
and look for them.

15:43.401 --> 15:45.745
Megan, my deputy has more
important things to do...

15:45.903 --> 15:48.201
than look for camp
counselors with car trouble.

15:48.364 --> 15:50.913
Come on. Can't you put out
an all points bulletin?

15:51.075 --> 15:54.295
- That would be wicked decent.
- Your mother own a sewing machine, kid?

15:54.745 --> 15:57.794
- Excuse me?
- Hey, off.

15:58.249 --> 16:00.547
Oh, hey. Sorry.

16:01.002 --> 16:03.096
Darren and my sister
Lizbeth are in charge...

16:03.254 --> 16:06.303
of organizing the new campgrounds
and we don't know what to do.

16:06.466 --> 16:09.595
And all the kiddies arrive today.
We're not ready to deal with that.

16:09.760 --> 16:12.263
I sympathize with you kids.

16:12.430 --> 16:16.151
Best I can do is call the station in
Carpenter and have them keep a lookout.

16:16.309 --> 16:18.437
I've got a bad feeling
what might've happened.

16:18.603 --> 16:21.072
Hopefully they're fine,
but with Jason out there...

16:21.230 --> 16:23.983
- Shut up.
- Jason who?

16:24.150 --> 16:26.494
Megan, stay away from him.
He's dangerous.

16:26.652 --> 16:28.871
I'm not dangerous.
Jason is out there.

16:29.030 --> 16:32.284
He's looking for me. He's
probably headed back to the camp.

16:32.450 --> 16:33.997
I told you to shut up.

16:34.160 --> 16:36.083
You mean the Jason of Camp Blood?

16:36.245 --> 16:37.872
- Yes.
- No.

16:38.414 --> 16:40.212
You kids better leave.

16:40.374 --> 16:43.469
This boy is not well and I need
to talk to him in private.

16:43.628 --> 16:45.301
- Come on, Dad. We were just...
- Megan.

16:45.463 --> 16:47.090
Take your friends back to the camp.

16:47.256 --> 16:49.759
I'll let you know if I hear
anything about your camp leaders.

16:49.926 --> 16:52.054
Don't beat him up
too bad. He's cute.

16:52.220 --> 16:54.222
Megan, leave.

16:55.640 --> 16:57.267
Ooh. He's cute.

17:08.569 --> 17:10.722
I was gonna call that clinic
and have them collect your ass

17:10.748 --> 17:12.617
but I don't want you
here any longer,

17:12.644 --> 17:15.267
poisoning my daughter or anyone else,
with your warped sense of humor.

17:15.292 --> 17:19.647
They have to be warned, sheriff. Jason
will return to the area that's familiar.

17:19.674 --> 17:23.675
No matter what you call it, it's
still Camp Crystal Lake to him.

17:23.834 --> 17:27.464
We're gonna escort you to the
edge of my jurisdiction.

17:28.214 --> 17:31.309
Then we will say goodbye and we'll
never see you around here again.

17:31.467 --> 17:33.014
Do we understand each other?

17:38.516 --> 17:41.360
Shit. Shit. Damn.

17:41.894 --> 17:44.067
I know I'm gonna get
blamed for this.

17:46.315 --> 17:49.034
Say old Martin ain't
a good caretaker.

17:49.193 --> 17:51.571
Hell, I'm a damn high
school graduate.

17:51.737 --> 17:54.786
And I deserve this job.
I earned it.

17:54.949 --> 17:57.793
Nobody's gonna find out.

17:59.328 --> 18:02.081
Shitheads couldn't even
stick him back in right.

18:02.248 --> 18:05.548
Well, I ain't gonna
touch the slimy sucker.

18:06.627 --> 18:09.722
Why'd they have to
go and dig up Jason?

18:10.548 --> 18:14.769
Some folks have a strange
idea of entertainment.

18:26.897 --> 18:29.070
Hey, you guys. You guys,
I'm getting worried.

18:29.233 --> 18:32.954
- About Jason? Ooh.
- No, about Darren and Lizbeth.

18:33.112 --> 18:35.410
They should've at least
called, don't you think?

18:35.573 --> 18:36.825
- Megan?
- What?

18:36.991 --> 18:39.210
- Hello?
- Yeah, heh.

18:40.995 --> 18:43.714
This girl's back in the jail
cell with her prisoner of love.

18:43.873 --> 18:45.375
Aw. Ha, ha.

18:45.541 --> 18:47.714
Don't be messing with no
crazy jailbird, girl.

18:47.877 --> 18:50.255
- Those dudes are bad news.
- Oh, and how do you know?

18:50.421 --> 18:52.844
I been around long enough
to see plenty on TV.

18:53.007 --> 18:56.102
- TV?
- Yeah. Heh.

18:57.887 --> 19:00.015
I don't know about that guy, Megan.

19:00.181 --> 19:02.434
He seemed pretty weird
with all that Jason stuff.

19:02.600 --> 19:06.446
You know what you need? I've been telling you
this forever. You need a guy like me, eh?

19:06.604 --> 19:09.483
- Guy who's not so twisted.
- Maybe he was telling the truth.

19:10.274 --> 19:12.276
Just because our parents
keep telling us...

19:12.443 --> 19:15.617
that Jason was only a legend
doesn't mean it wasn't true.

19:16.447 --> 19:19.041
What if he did come back here...

19:19.241 --> 19:23.872
looking for the camp counselor that
caused him to drown as a boy...

19:24.455 --> 19:30.303
searching for the one that
decapitated his vengeful mother?

19:31.962 --> 19:35.341
And you do know what today's
date is, don't you?

19:36.050 --> 19:41.227
And I can think of only one
thing even more terrifying.

19:41.389 --> 19:42.857
What?

19:47.812 --> 19:49.780
The kids are here.

19:54.151 --> 19:56.199
Yeah, right!

19:56.779 --> 19:58.702
Be careful. You may fall.

20:03.494 --> 20:06.998
Here they are.
And they're all yours.

20:08.249 --> 20:11.048
Think I'd rather
deal with old Jason.

20:35.151 --> 20:37.995
Once we nail Roy,
that's it. Victory is ours.

20:38.154 --> 20:40.657
It's taking forever. I'm starving.

20:40.823 --> 20:42.200
That's your trouble, Larry.

20:42.366 --> 20:44.460
That's why your sales are
always behind quota.

20:44.618 --> 20:47.713
Your instinct to eat is stronger
than your instinct to win.

20:47.872 --> 20:51.342
- You're a real ass, you know that?
- Better than being all ass.

20:51.500 --> 20:56.131
- Oh. That is so unfair.
- Oh, here we go with unfair again.

20:56.297 --> 20:58.800
- War is not fair.
- Give me a break, would you, please?

20:58.966 --> 21:01.560
- This is not war. This is a game.
- War is an ugly thing.

21:01.719 --> 21:04.768
- I'm hungry. I wanna get a sandwich.
- Wait till we kill something, then you can eat.

21:04.930 --> 21:06.557
Calm down, would you?

21:06.724 --> 21:09.318
- You're an insurance salesman.
- Death is my business.

21:09.477 --> 21:12.526
You become this whole other
person when we're out here, Stan.

21:12.688 --> 21:15.737
- I don't like it.
- Hey, this is a man's game.

21:15.900 --> 21:18.824
Requires a man's cunning.
A man's intelligence...

21:20.946 --> 21:21.993
Fuck!

21:22.156 --> 21:25.376
- With a woman's touch.
- Now, wait a minute!

21:25.534 --> 21:28.834
- I thought Burt shot you!
- See any paint?

21:29.580 --> 21:33.084
Sorry, guys. I did in Mr.
Commando, weapons and all.

21:33.250 --> 21:36.925
Survival's the name of the
game and that flag is mine.

21:38.506 --> 21:42.101
I can't believe this.
Burt never gets shot.

21:42.259 --> 21:45.229
- Never should've let her play.
- It's a damn company exec game...

21:45.387 --> 21:46.934
and she's a damn company exec.

21:47.097 --> 21:52.024
Now, now, boys. Don't be spoilsports.
Put on your headbands.

22:03.614 --> 22:07.209
Dumb broad. She tricked me.

22:07.368 --> 22:10.042
God, they're gonna
laugh for months.

22:10.412 --> 22:12.961
She should've stayed in the
kitchen where she belongs.

22:13.874 --> 22:16.844
A woman shouldn't even be
allowed in these games.

22:17.294 --> 22:19.843
It's not a game. It's life.

22:38.899 --> 22:42.199
Jason really screwed up that
poor son of a bitch's mind.

22:42.361 --> 22:45.535
He really believes that Jason's
still alive, doesn't he?

22:45.698 --> 22:47.792
That's not what worries me.

22:47.950 --> 22:49.952
It's how far he'll go
to try and prove it.

23:28.782 --> 23:30.284
Darn.

23:32.995 --> 23:34.918
Oh, no.

23:35.080 --> 23:37.048
No.

23:38.959 --> 23:42.213
Oh, my God. No.

23:42.379 --> 23:44.882
What...? Come...

23:45.382 --> 23:50.104
Where...? Oh, no. Oh, no. God.

23:50.262 --> 23:52.481
Come on out, you guys!
The game's over.

23:52.640 --> 23:54.108
You don't know. What about Roy?

23:54.266 --> 23:55.859
- Nobody's seen him.
- Of course not.

23:56.018 --> 23:58.897
If he hasn't accidentally pelleted
himself, I'm sure he's lost.

23:59.063 --> 24:01.407
- Well, the game's not over till it's over.
- That's right.

24:01.565 --> 24:02.782
Shh.

24:06.904 --> 24:09.373
Wait a second. What was that?

24:09.531 --> 24:11.158
- What?
- Nothing.

24:11.325 --> 24:13.327
I could swear I heard something.

24:13.494 --> 24:14.916
- I'm hungry.
- Oh, God.

24:15.079 --> 24:17.173
Be quiet.

24:38.852 --> 24:41.981
Oh, my God. My God.

24:42.147 --> 24:44.445
Help, guys! Help me!

24:46.360 --> 24:47.862
Help!

24:49.279 --> 24:51.532
Oh, no. Help me, guys! Help!

24:51.991 --> 24:54.744
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.

24:54.910 --> 24:59.666
Oh, God. Help me. Somebody help me!

24:59.832 --> 25:01.800
He's gonna kill me.

25:17.683 --> 25:20.812
Fucking-A, what did I tell you?
Hit the noise and the cherries.

26:21.538 --> 26:23.711
Sheriff. Sheriff, wait.

26:23.874 --> 26:26.969
- You gotta listen.
- I'm tired of listening to you, kid.

26:27.127 --> 26:29.095
I gotta... I gotta show
you Jason's grave.

26:29.254 --> 26:31.177
I've seen it. Come on, get up!

26:31.715 --> 26:33.513
- Get up!
- Please, sheriff.

26:33.675 --> 26:35.302
You'll see we dug it up.

26:35.469 --> 26:39.190
Well, he must've got chilly in the
night and pulled the dirt back over.

26:39.598 --> 26:42.772
That's not right.
Somebody covered it over.

26:42.935 --> 26:45.313
- I gotta see it.
- Freeze it, psycho.

26:45.479 --> 26:47.402
Now see what you've done.

26:47.564 --> 26:49.316
You made my deputy
draw his revolver.

26:49.483 --> 26:52.236
He's been dying to try out
his mail-order laser scope.

26:52.402 --> 26:55.702
Wherever the red dot
goes, you bang.

26:55.864 --> 26:58.287
- What's the problem, sheriff?
- No problem, Martin.

26:58.450 --> 27:00.498
Just a vagrant kid.
We got it under control.

27:00.661 --> 27:03.505
- Did you cover up Jason's grave?
- What are you talking about?

27:03.664 --> 27:05.917
Don't concern yourself.
This kid needs treatment.

27:06.083 --> 27:08.927
Jason's not in his grave,
Hawes is. Dig it up!

27:09.086 --> 27:13.011
You gotta dig it up!
You gotta dig it up!

27:20.347 --> 27:21.644
Dig him up?

27:23.100 --> 27:25.603
Does he think I'm a farthead?

27:26.353 --> 27:27.946
Yeah!

27:28.105 --> 27:31.780
Okay. Is this gonna be
the best weekend ever?

27:32.025 --> 27:33.242
Yeah!

27:33.402 --> 27:36.121
- Are we gonna go fishing?
- Yeah!

27:36.280 --> 27:41.286
- Are we gonna scare all the boys?
- Yeah!

27:41.451 --> 27:45.297
Okay. Are we gonna, uh...?

27:45.455 --> 27:48.959
Are we gonna not eat
Brussels sprouts?

27:49.126 --> 27:50.673
- Yeah!
- What happened to Cort?

27:50.836 --> 27:52.133
Are you ready?

27:52.296 --> 27:55.641
He's taken the young men off to
teach them my favorite sport.

27:55.799 --> 27:58.769
- Heh, which is?
- Boy Scouting, honey.

27:58.927 --> 28:01.430
Heh. Cort? You've gotta be kidding.

28:01.597 --> 28:03.019
You gotta be kidding.

28:03.182 --> 28:05.810
Listen, you obviously don't
know anything about Indians.

28:05.976 --> 28:09.822
Probably none of you do. Look, here's the
story. These are called Indian markers.

28:09.980 --> 28:12.153
Let's just say you have
a chief, all right?

28:12.316 --> 28:14.489
And he dumps his squaw
or his wife or whatever.

28:14.651 --> 28:18.030
He decides, "I'm gonna pick up with
another woman and take off with her."

28:18.197 --> 28:20.370
He takes off, leaving his
son with the mother.

28:20.532 --> 28:22.500
A week or two later, the son
wants to catch up with his dad.

28:22.659 --> 28:25.333
He wants to learn how to
shoot a bow, kill a buffalo.

28:25.495 --> 28:27.497
So, what happens is
he comes along...

28:27.664 --> 28:30.417
sees the rocks, says, "Dad,
he went that way," obviously.

28:30.584 --> 28:33.463
He knocks them all down before
the mother catches up...

28:33.629 --> 28:35.973
because he doesn't wanna
see any of her anymore.

28:36.131 --> 28:39.010
Pretty much, that's the basic
story. It tells you where to go.

28:39.176 --> 28:42.897
If this is exciting as it gets,
we're in big trouble, dude.

28:47.768 --> 28:49.736
Let's go.

28:56.193 --> 28:58.616
Like the sign says, you are
now leaving Forest Green.

28:58.779 --> 29:02.534
Don't forget to buckle up.
You are damn lucky, kid.

29:02.699 --> 29:04.417
With all the grief
you've given me...

29:04.576 --> 29:07.170
you should be leaving wearing
your balls as earrings.

29:07.329 --> 29:10.253
And if I ever see you around here
again, you can guarantee it.

29:12.376 --> 29:14.799
Let's get the hell
out of here, Rick.

29:27.266 --> 29:32.067
<i>Take you home again, Kathleen</i>

29:32.229 --> 29:34.231
<i>To where...</i>

29:35.732 --> 29:39.532
<i>Your heart will feel no pain</i>

29:40.028 --> 29:43.783
<i>I'll take you home again</i>

29:44.533 --> 29:47.753
Steven, it's beautiful.

29:47.911 --> 29:51.085
God, I love it. I really do.

29:51.915 --> 29:55.010
I don't know. I mean,
you know, I'm sort of hurt.

29:55.168 --> 29:58.593
You thought I brought you up
here just to... Ah, never mind.

29:58.755 --> 30:01.508
Yeah, well, I guess I do owe you.

30:01.675 --> 30:04.770
Yeah. No, look. I have a headache
and I've been working out.

30:04.928 --> 30:08.057
- Mm-hm. Ah.
- I'm... I'm sore...

30:08.223 --> 30:10.225
- And...
- Yeah. Right. Forget about it.

30:10.392 --> 30:12.315
Well, it's a messy act and...

30:12.477 --> 30:14.024
- What the heck.
- Great.

30:17.441 --> 30:20.035
<i>Again, Kathleen</i>

30:20.193 --> 30:21.615
Oh.

30:22.446 --> 30:24.289
Where'd the road go?

30:25.073 --> 30:27.451
I can't find the road.

30:27.617 --> 30:30.120
Where's the road?

30:30.620 --> 30:35.091
Kathleen, you led me astray.

30:39.671 --> 30:42.720
What's that? What's that?

30:45.135 --> 30:46.261
Huh?

30:57.230 --> 31:00.860
Darling, you're gonna
be the death of me.

31:01.026 --> 31:04.826
Yeah, but what a way to go, huh?

31:22.547 --> 31:24.675
- Stay here.
- Steven, please.

31:24.841 --> 31:27.139
- Stay here.
- No, Steven. Don't.

31:45.987 --> 31:47.705
Steven. Steven, what's going on?

31:47.864 --> 31:49.207
- Annette, let's go.
- Okay.

31:49.366 --> 31:51.039
Never mind.

31:55.539 --> 31:58.759
- What are we gonna do?
- We gotta get to the sheriff's office.

32:39.833 --> 32:43.087
- Pick a card.
- I don't wanna play anymore, Sissy.

32:43.253 --> 32:46.928
- Oh, come on. Pick a card.
- No, I really don't.

32:47.132 --> 32:49.555
Okay. Okay. I've got a great game.

32:49.718 --> 32:51.766
It's called Camp Blood.

32:51.928 --> 32:53.271
- Great.
- Yeah.

32:53.430 --> 32:56.400
The object of the game is, first
you take this jack of spades...

32:56.558 --> 32:57.901
which is Jason, right?

32:58.059 --> 33:01.404
And then you have all these face
cards, which represent counselors.

33:01.563 --> 33:03.782
The queen of hearts is me.

33:03.940 --> 33:07.490
- Now, who do you wanna be?
- Oh, come on, Sissy.

33:07.652 --> 33:09.495
Okay, you be the queen of diamonds.

33:09.654 --> 33:13.204
What you do is you shuffle Jason
up in these cards here...

33:13.366 --> 33:18.042
and you put them in piles, because
the piles represent cabins.

33:18.205 --> 33:23.587
Now, the object of the game is to
find out which cabin Jason is in.

33:23.752 --> 33:25.800
Did Megan say when
she's coming back?

33:25.962 --> 33:28.135
Of course not. You wanna
bet she took him...

33:28.298 --> 33:30.018
a loaf of bread with
a saw hidden in it?

33:32.511 --> 33:34.434
I'm gonna call her.

33:34.930 --> 33:37.934
Hopefully her dad has found out what's
happened to Darren and Lizbeth.

33:38.099 --> 33:40.978
I say if they're not here by
morning, we send the kids home.

33:41.144 --> 33:42.737
We're not prepared to run this...

33:56.910 --> 34:00.005
- She saw a monster!
- Who did?

34:03.667 --> 34:07.137
- It's okay. We're here.
- Yeah, honey, we're here.

34:07.295 --> 34:10.094
- So, what happened?
- There was this monster.

34:10.257 --> 34:13.806
And he was after me and
he wanted to kill me.

34:14.636 --> 34:17.435
- Where?
- He was everywhere.

34:17.597 --> 34:19.975
- Oh, you mean you had a bad dream.
- No.

34:20.141 --> 34:22.438
It was real, just like on TV.

34:22.601 --> 34:24.855
Okay, listen, sweetie.
What's your name?

34:25.021 --> 34:27.239
- Nancy.
- Well, Nancy...

34:27.399 --> 34:31.029
I'm Paula, remember?
And this is Sissy.

34:31.194 --> 34:35.324
And we're gonna be right out there all
night so nothing can hurt you. Okay?

34:36.574 --> 34:40.125
So no more bad dreams can
come around here, huh?

34:41.246 --> 34:44.545
Good. Okay, lay down.

34:46.126 --> 34:48.879
There. Okay?

34:49.462 --> 34:51.054
Okay.

34:56.177 --> 34:59.852
Hey, wait a minute, where's Cort?
I haven't seen him for hours.

35:00.015 --> 35:03.235
I don't know. He called somebody,
then he just took off.

35:03.393 --> 35:07.398
Said something about checking out
things that go bump in the night.

35:15.530 --> 35:18.374
You're the best. The best.

35:25.040 --> 35:27.134
You gotta keep it up to
the end of this song.

35:27.584 --> 35:29.427
How much longer?

35:30.462 --> 35:31.759
It's only 10 more minutes.

36:09.167 --> 36:10.965
- Fuck!
- Oh, yeah.

36:11.127 --> 36:12.504
Wait a sec and I'll...

36:12.671 --> 36:15.220
Cort, you didn't already?

36:15.382 --> 36:17.430
Oh, come on, wasn't that
the end of the song?

36:17.592 --> 36:19.686
Great, just great.

36:26.518 --> 36:29.613
If this thing is burned out, frigging
Horace is gonna have my butt.

36:29.771 --> 36:32.024
- Who's Horace?
- My frigging stepfather...

36:32.190 --> 36:34.613
and asshole in residence.

36:36.361 --> 36:39.205
Ah. Now, how'd that happen?

36:39.364 --> 36:40.741
What?

36:42.992 --> 36:44.960
Will you go out and
plug the cord back in?

36:45.120 --> 36:48.169
- Who unplugged the cord?
- Smokey the Bear. I don't know. Go do it.

36:48.331 --> 36:52.928
- Do you know how cold it is out there, Nikki?
- I don't give a shit, Cort. Go do it!

36:53.211 --> 36:57.057
You're a real pain in the ass.
A major pain in the ass.

36:57.215 --> 37:00.936
Will you hurry up? I gotta get this
back before Horace finds out I took it.

37:01.094 --> 37:03.188
Hurry up.

37:06.474 --> 37:09.353
- Will you come on?
- All right.

37:09.519 --> 37:12.398
I'm going. I'm going, okay?

37:12.856 --> 37:15.450
God, shut the hell up.

37:54.522 --> 37:55.774
- What...?
- Cort.

37:57.233 --> 37:59.656
- Nikki.
- What are you doing?

37:59.819 --> 38:02.948
- Look at this.
- What happened to it?

38:03.114 --> 38:06.084
I don't know, but I say unless you
wanna look exactly like it...

38:06.242 --> 38:08.620
we make this place a
memory right now.

38:23.468 --> 38:25.766
Nikki, somebody's out there.

38:26.179 --> 38:29.809
- What if it's that guy Jason?
- I don't wanna know.

38:37.190 --> 38:40.865
- No way. This isn't happening.
- You're right, it isn't.

38:45.114 --> 38:48.709
- You gonna drive or not?
- Whoo! Out of here.

38:51.955 --> 38:54.674
Shit! Damn it, Cort.

38:56.251 --> 38:57.924
Shit!

39:03.591 --> 39:05.309
Go!

39:08.137 --> 39:11.061
Shit! Cort!

39:12.475 --> 39:13.727
Whoo! Boy, this baby jams.

39:13.893 --> 39:17.238
Let me tell you, for a big
truck, it's not bad at all.

39:19.107 --> 39:20.950
That's it! Pull over, I'm driving.

39:21.484 --> 39:22.906
No way, babe, I wanna rock!

39:23.611 --> 39:24.658
Yeah! Whoo.

39:28.950 --> 39:30.202
Whoo. This is... This is great!

39:30.368 --> 39:34.339
I've never driven a house before.
I like this. This is great.

39:48.845 --> 39:53.521
Sounds like you're having fun back there.
What are you doing? Need some company?

39:59.772 --> 40:01.399
Ooh, that sounds great.

40:01.566 --> 40:03.364
Do you need some
company or what, huh?

40:03.526 --> 40:05.654
Cort!

40:05.820 --> 40:09.575
Whoo! This is great. I am
having such a good time.

40:12.994 --> 40:15.338
Ha, ha. This is great!

40:20.793 --> 40:23.672
Hey, Nikki, what are you doing
back there, taking a dump?

40:25.715 --> 40:28.013
Mind if I come back
and snatch a peek?

40:28.176 --> 40:30.270
Or vice versa?

40:43.066 --> 40:44.659
Whoo! Yeah!

40:51.449 --> 40:53.326
Nikki, listen to this.

41:29.487 --> 41:31.455
What makes you so high and mighty?

41:31.614 --> 41:33.958
You keep forgetting, little
Megan, I'm the parent.

41:34.117 --> 41:35.790
You're the child.

41:35.952 --> 41:37.795
When are you gonna stop
treating me like one?

41:37.996 --> 41:41.693
When you stop acting like one.
Tommy Jarvis is a very sick boy.

41:41.719 --> 41:44.973
Oh, how do you know, Dad? What'd
you do, take his temperature?

41:44.999 --> 41:47.326
Better watch that
smart-mouthing, young lady.

41:47.505 --> 41:49.599
"If your mother were
still alive..."

41:49.757 --> 41:53.807
That's it. Out. I don't need
this tonight. Out, Megan.

41:56.639 --> 41:57.891
Sheriff's office.

41:58.057 --> 42:00.435
Oh, I'm sorry, he can't come
to the phone right now.

42:00.601 --> 42:03.400
He's in the can draining his lizard.
May I take a message?

42:03.563 --> 42:06.316
Oops, here he comes
now. Please hold.

42:06.691 --> 42:09.194
- It's Rick.
- What?

42:09.569 --> 42:12.243
- What kind of problem?
- You better get the hell down here.

42:12.405 --> 42:14.373
I found what's left of
those counselors...

42:14.532 --> 42:18.503
and it looks like someone did
them in using Jason's old MO.

42:19.370 --> 42:22.340
I knew I should have done
something about that son of a...

42:22.498 --> 42:24.171
Where are you?

42:25.626 --> 42:29.176
- Right, I'm on my way.
- What is it?

42:29.714 --> 42:32.684
Seems your boyfriend wants people
to believe Jason has returned.

42:32.842 --> 42:35.436
- I thought Jason was just a legend.
- That's right.

42:35.595 --> 42:37.689
Only, Tommy wants to prove
the legend is true.

42:37.847 --> 42:42.068
Now, you stay put.
And I'm not kidding.

43:55.258 --> 43:56.635
Sheriff's office.

43:56.801 --> 43:59.554
I'm sorry, he's not in.
Can I take a message?

43:59.929 --> 44:03.775
Oh, hi. This is his daughter, Megan.
I met you this morning, remember?

44:03.975 --> 44:07.104
Yeah, hi. Listen, I've gotta talk
to your dad about... About Jason.

44:07.270 --> 44:10.274
I've got a plan. But first I
need to buy some supplies and...

44:10.439 --> 44:12.783
Tommy, my father's out
looking for you right now.

44:12.942 --> 44:16.037
Something happened tonight and he's
sure you're responsible for it.

44:16.195 --> 44:19.165
- If he finds you, he's gonna...
- Yeah, he made that real clear.

44:19.323 --> 44:20.996
Megan, Jason is out there.

44:21.159 --> 44:23.662
I'm positive he's headed back
to the camp. He's gonna...

44:23.870 --> 44:26.498
- Where are you? I'll come pick you up.
- What?

44:26.706 --> 44:29.209
It's the only way. If my
father sees you in your car...

44:29.375 --> 44:31.216
he's gonna nail you in
a second. Where are you?

44:31.335 --> 44:34.680
Uh, Karloff's General
something, um...

44:34.881 --> 44:38.886
I know just where it is. I'll see
you in a half-hour, heh. Whoo!

44:39.051 --> 44:40.394
Megan.

45:25.389 --> 45:27.562
- Okay, lift it, ugh.
- Ugh.

45:29.852 --> 45:32.901
I want all officers, units and
stations within a 50-mile radius...

45:33.064 --> 45:35.066
- alerted about this wacko kid.
- Yes, sir.

45:35.233 --> 45:37.611
You have his vehicle description.
I want roadblocks.

45:37.777 --> 45:40.326
- Sheriff, get over here!
- Shit, now what?

45:41.656 --> 45:43.203
Come on.

45:46.744 --> 45:48.872
Mike, over here.

45:52.291 --> 45:53.759
Is that all you found?

45:53.960 --> 45:55.758
I wish it was.

46:07.348 --> 46:09.316
I'll order up some body bags.

46:09.475 --> 46:12.479
Our boy sure wants us
to believe his story.

46:12.645 --> 46:15.774
Well, he picked the right
day to pull this shit.

46:15.940 --> 46:17.567
What do you mean?

46:17.858 --> 46:20.702
Happy Friday the 13th.

47:09.785 --> 47:11.458
All right, who's out there?

47:12.288 --> 47:13.961
What's going on?

47:19.670 --> 47:22.640
Think I hear somebody
fooling around out there.

47:23.299 --> 47:27.645
It's gotta be Cort. You know how
he loves to try and scare us, heh.

47:27.803 --> 47:29.931
Teach him a lesson.

48:41.877 --> 48:45.222
You guys, try not to wake the kids.

48:58.894 --> 49:00.146
I'm gonna borrow your car.

49:00.312 --> 49:02.110
You can't do this.
It's too dangerous.

49:02.273 --> 49:05.698
You gonna talk about dangerous?
You wanna leave that truck in plain sight?

49:05.860 --> 49:07.112
Hide it behind the store
and let's get out of here.

49:07.278 --> 49:09.906
Look, this isn't a game.
You're not going with me.

49:10.072 --> 49:11.574
I'm already responsible for...

49:11.740 --> 49:13.788
You said you needed
some supplies, right?

49:13.951 --> 49:15.669
- Yes, but I...
- Then let's get going.

49:15.828 --> 49:19.173
We can argue about it on the way.
Tell me what you need and I'll get it.

49:19.331 --> 49:21.675
- Megan...
- Besides, nobody drives this puppy but me.

49:21.834 --> 49:24.257
Now, hide that heap and let's book.

50:01.207 --> 50:03.960
- Can't this tub go any faster?
- You got it.

50:04.168 --> 50:08.139
- You just keep your eye out for roadblocks.
- Okay. There's one.

50:14.970 --> 50:16.472
Get down.

50:21.936 --> 50:24.314
Hey! Hey!

50:37.034 --> 50:39.833
Unit 45, Officer Pappas to
Sheriff Garris, do you copy?

50:41.580 --> 50:43.423
- Yeah.
- We've got a different vehicle...

50:43.582 --> 50:46.335
that took off when they saw us.
I saw somebody duck down.

50:46.544 --> 50:49.172
- Got a description or plates?
- I got the whole enchilada.

50:49.338 --> 50:53.559
It's a '77 orange Camaro. License
number Mary, William, 85-10.

50:54.468 --> 50:56.186
That's my daughter's car.

50:57.972 --> 51:00.350
Uh, how do you want
us to proceed, sir?

51:00.516 --> 51:02.143
With extreme care, asshole.

51:02.309 --> 51:05.939
If that kid is with her, there's every
good chance he'll do something crazy.

51:09.525 --> 51:11.072
Please, don't do anything crazy.

51:18.409 --> 51:21.083
I know what I'm doing. I got
you your supplies, didn't I?

51:28.335 --> 51:30.963
If I can just get us to
Cunningham Road, I can lose them.

51:31.380 --> 51:33.053
Stay down.

51:34.300 --> 51:35.893
Whatever you say.

51:43.559 --> 51:45.186
That's what I want.

51:48.522 --> 51:50.924
This is gonna be a
hairy turn. Hang on.

52:03.412 --> 52:06.336
Megan, step out of the car.

52:07.207 --> 52:09.050
End of the line.

52:11.003 --> 52:12.755
Oh, shit.

52:49.416 --> 52:52.044
Paula, I can't sleep. I'm scared.

52:52.211 --> 52:54.305
I saw someone at my window.

52:54.463 --> 52:58.263
- Where did you get this?
- I found it outside.

52:58.425 --> 53:03.306
Ah, you know what? Sissy and
Cort are playing jokes.

53:03.472 --> 53:05.315
You know, trying to
scare each other.

53:05.516 --> 53:06.893
- Why?
- Well...

53:07.101 --> 53:09.479
because grownups think
it's funny to be scared.

53:09.645 --> 53:12.694
- What?
- Heh, never mind.

53:13.565 --> 53:16.910
I can't believe it's that
late. No one called.

53:17.069 --> 53:19.822
- I better...
- Who you calling?

53:21.198 --> 53:23.997
Why don't we go and find
Sissy and Cort first.

53:24.159 --> 53:26.628
Then you can go to bed.

53:26.787 --> 53:30.667
- Wait. What if they try to scare us?
- Well, we'll scare them right back.

53:30.833 --> 53:32.676
- Okay, heh.
- Okay, heh.

53:36.338 --> 53:39.387
Let's go. Let's find them.

53:52.896 --> 53:54.309
I said, shut up!

53:54.335 --> 53:56.525
All he's asking you to
do is just check it out.

53:56.567 --> 53:59.529
- You've got me where you want me.
- If I had you where I wanted you...

53:59.555 --> 54:02.069
they'd be pumping your
ass full of formaldehyde.

54:02.197 --> 54:05.077
Why don't you at least call the camp,
make sure everything's all right.

54:05.151 --> 54:07.816
We have, trying to track you down.
The phone there's disconnected.

54:07.842 --> 54:10.312
- Doesn't that tell you something?
- Yeah, they should've paid their bill.

54:10.338 --> 54:11.407
Sheriff.

54:12.875 --> 54:15.549
You just sit tight, Jason.
As soon as the authorities...

54:15.711 --> 54:18.965
- from Carpenter get here...
- Sheriff! You better take this.

54:20.257 --> 54:22.055
Sheriff Garris.

54:24.720 --> 54:26.393
What time?

54:28.599 --> 54:30.021
I'll be right there.

54:34.646 --> 54:37.240
- What's happened?
- Rick.

54:38.567 --> 54:41.662
Keep an eye on this wacko.
I'll be back as soon as I can.

54:41.862 --> 54:43.159
What's going on?

54:43.363 --> 54:45.741
Make sure my daughter
stays put. She's grounded.

54:45.949 --> 54:46.543
Tell me!

54:46.569 --> 54:48.944
They just found your
friend Cort and some girl.

54:49.077 --> 54:52.923
Her head was crushed in and Cort, he
had a knife rammed through his skull.

54:53.332 --> 54:54.629
No.

54:55.459 --> 54:58.759
Tommy Jarvis is a
psychopathic killer.

55:00.088 --> 55:02.591
- He wants you to believe that...
- It was Jason.

55:02.758 --> 55:04.135
Sheriff, when did it happen?

55:04.718 --> 55:09.144
For God's sake, Meggie,
stay away from him, please.

55:10.474 --> 55:12.272
- What time did this happen?
- What difference does that make?

55:12.434 --> 55:15.278
- What time?
- Eight-thirty, 9:00. Why?

55:15.979 --> 55:19.028
Tommy was with me
all that time, Dad.

55:27.032 --> 55:28.500
Rick...

55:29.284 --> 55:31.628
I'll call you from there.
Lock him up.

55:37.334 --> 55:40.338
Okay, flash, into the cage.

55:53.350 --> 55:56.320
I'm sure Sissy and Cort are
back in their cabins by now.

55:56.478 --> 55:59.197
So you just go back to
sleep and don't worry.

55:59.398 --> 56:01.821
But what if I get scared again?

56:01.984 --> 56:03.327
Shh!

56:03.485 --> 56:06.659
You know what I used to do when
I was a little girl and I got scared?

56:06.822 --> 56:10.042
I would close my eyes and
say a little prayer.

56:10.200 --> 56:15.172
And you know what? Pretty soon,
everything scary went away.

56:15.330 --> 56:19.005
It worked for me. I bet it'll
work for you too, heh.

56:19.167 --> 56:22.171
- Good night.
- Good night.

56:23.046 --> 56:25.390
See you in the morning.

57:15.057 --> 57:16.559
Cort?

57:51.343 --> 57:52.845
Sissy?

59:07.335 --> 59:09.008
No!

59:54.424 --> 59:57.724
- No.
- Yes.

01:00:15.237 --> 01:00:16.910
So, what are you drawing?

01:00:17.114 --> 01:00:18.457
So, what's it to you?

01:00:18.615 --> 01:00:20.413
Pipe down, Jarvis!

01:00:20.575 --> 01:00:23.920
I was just curious as to
what she's drawing, is all.

01:00:25.080 --> 01:00:26.502
There, you happy?

01:00:27.916 --> 01:00:29.759
- No.
- Why?

01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:31.837
Because it stinks.

01:00:39.261 --> 01:00:41.684
- Okay, give it back.
- Come and get it.

01:00:42.264 --> 01:00:44.813
I'll get it for you, babe.

01:00:46.351 --> 01:00:47.648
Come and get it.

01:00:48.145 --> 01:00:49.897
Give it back, punk!

01:01:06.121 --> 01:01:07.464
Hey!

01:01:07.622 --> 01:01:11.126
Hey, hey! Get your
hands off her, animal.

01:01:11.293 --> 01:01:14.513
You little turd! I ought
to punch you silly.

01:01:15.714 --> 01:01:17.466
Let him out of there, Rick.

01:01:18.425 --> 01:01:19.677
Megan.

01:01:19.885 --> 01:01:21.637
Don't clown around.

01:01:21.803 --> 01:01:23.726
I'm not the one with
the funny red nose.

01:01:24.306 --> 01:01:27.435
Now, open the cell and let him out.

01:01:28.310 --> 01:01:29.653
Meggie.

01:01:29.811 --> 01:01:31.813
I'm not kidding.

01:01:31.980 --> 01:01:33.823
You better do as she says...

01:01:33.982 --> 01:01:37.452
because wherever the red
dot goes, you bang.

01:01:45.702 --> 01:01:47.955
You son of a bitch!

01:02:00.342 --> 01:02:03.016
You're really screwing
up here, missy.

01:02:04.512 --> 01:02:06.981
Don't do this, Megan!

01:02:07.140 --> 01:02:08.892
Megan!

01:02:11.019 --> 01:02:13.488
- I thought he took your key.
- He did.

01:02:14.648 --> 01:02:16.901
- But I've got my hide-a-key.
- Not this time.

01:02:17.067 --> 01:02:19.661
- Hey, wait a minute.
- I appreciate you getting me out...

01:02:19.819 --> 01:02:21.947
but I have to finish
what I started here.

01:02:30.747 --> 01:02:34.877
Come on, hot lips, let's go.
You drive, I'll navigate.

01:02:52.644 --> 01:02:56.774
Let me know when we're about to blast
into hyperspace. I'll fasten my seatbelt.

01:02:56.940 --> 01:02:59.534
I got a bad feeling
we're already too late.

01:03:04.197 --> 01:03:05.995
Are you sure this is gonna work?

01:03:06.157 --> 01:03:08.535
Why didn't we just bring
the gun and blow him away?

01:03:08.702 --> 01:03:12.627
The only way now to stop Jason is to
return him to his original resting place.

01:03:12.789 --> 01:03:14.962
Where he drowned in 1957.

01:03:15.125 --> 01:03:18.755
- Lake Forest Green.
- Crystal Lake.

01:03:18.920 --> 01:03:21.764
Where this nightmare began.

01:04:29.074 --> 01:04:31.953
Now I lay me down to sleep.
I pray the Lord my soul to keep.

01:04:32.118 --> 01:04:36.339
If I should die before I wake,
I pray the Lord my soul to take.

01:04:36.498 --> 01:04:38.858
Now I lay me down to sleep.
I pray the Lord my soul to keep.

01:04:39.876 --> 01:04:43.506
If I should die before I wake,
I pray the Lord my soul to take.

01:04:52.639 --> 01:04:56.018
- So, what's the story here?
- Why don't you boys nose around.

01:04:56.184 --> 01:04:59.154
I gotta break the news to Megan's
friends about what's happened.

01:04:59.312 --> 01:05:01.155
- Holler if you see anything.
- Like what?

01:05:01.314 --> 01:05:05.364
Anything that don't belong.
And don't wake the kids.

01:05:08.196 --> 01:05:09.948
Come on, handsome.

01:05:13.910 --> 01:05:15.878
Girls?

01:05:18.039 --> 01:05:19.837
It's Sheriff Garris.

01:06:12.719 --> 01:06:14.312
Hey!

01:06:42.957 --> 01:06:44.755
Oh, my God.

01:07:00.975 --> 01:07:03.069
All right, come on out of there.

01:07:11.819 --> 01:07:14.197
I'm gonna ask you one more time.

01:07:16.908 --> 01:07:18.581
Come on out of there.

01:07:40.265 --> 01:07:43.360
Hey, hey, hey. What are you
doing running around out here?

01:07:43.601 --> 01:07:47.276
- Now, you go on back to bed.
- No! No, there's a scary man!

01:07:47.438 --> 01:07:49.440
Oh, what scary man?

01:08:13.881 --> 01:08:16.850
No, no, no. It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay. Everything's all right.

01:08:17.010 --> 01:08:19.479
Everything's okay,
honey. It's okay.

01:08:27.520 --> 01:08:29.522
Come on, boys, let's go.

01:08:37.654 --> 01:08:39.874
Come on, kids. Come on.

01:08:40.742 --> 01:08:42.915
Now, I want you to listen
to me very carefully.

01:08:43.077 --> 01:08:45.580
I want you to all lie down
on the floor under the beds.

01:08:45.747 --> 01:08:50.469
Do not get up until I come back. Do you
understand? Now, move, hurry. Come on.

01:08:51.961 --> 01:08:53.337
Come on.

01:10:14.877 --> 01:10:16.424
Fuck!

01:10:48.703 --> 01:10:50.797
- See, they did show up.
- Yeah.

01:10:52.165 --> 01:10:53.587
We'll have to take...

01:10:53.750 --> 01:10:55.798
Megan, wait!

01:11:05.344 --> 01:11:08.223
Oh, God. Dad! Daddy!

01:11:23.112 --> 01:11:26.161
It's okay. It's me, Megan.
Don't be afraid. It's okay.

01:11:26.324 --> 01:11:29.544
Shh, everything's gonna be
all right. Don't be afraid.

01:11:30.870 --> 01:11:33.043
- Is everyone okay?
- They're fine. They're fine.

01:11:33.206 --> 01:11:36.210
It's okay. Everything's
gonna be just fine, okay?

01:12:12.453 --> 01:12:16.424
I'm gonna go find my daddy, the sheriff,
and then we can all go home, okay?

01:12:16.874 --> 01:12:19.468
Now, uh, go back and lie down
where you were before...

01:12:19.627 --> 01:12:21.846
and stay there. Go ahead.

01:12:22.004 --> 01:12:24.473
And we'll come back and get you.

01:12:24.632 --> 01:12:26.680
I promise. Go lie down. Stay there.

01:12:26.843 --> 01:12:28.345
What do you think?

01:12:28.511 --> 01:12:30.934
I think we're dead meat.

01:12:35.393 --> 01:12:37.441
Daddy!

01:12:39.939 --> 01:12:42.033
Dad, answer me!

01:12:42.233 --> 01:12:43.655
Dad, where are you?

01:12:43.860 --> 01:12:47.455
Megan! Use your dad's
radio! Call for help!

01:12:47.655 --> 01:12:48.872
And an ambulance!

01:12:57.790 --> 01:12:59.508
Oh, God.

01:13:01.002 --> 01:13:02.800
Stop it!

01:13:04.630 --> 01:13:07.258
Daddy, where are you?

01:13:09.594 --> 01:13:12.689
Daddy, please come to help us!

01:13:13.264 --> 01:13:14.857
Daddy!

01:13:18.519 --> 01:13:20.692
Real dead meat.

01:13:20.855 --> 01:13:24.450
So, what were you gonna
be when you grew up?

01:13:25.735 --> 01:13:27.954
Daddy, where are you?

01:13:29.739 --> 01:13:33.039
Daddy! Come help us, please!

01:13:38.915 --> 01:13:40.167
No, not her!

01:13:41.083 --> 01:13:43.085
No!

01:14:06.025 --> 01:14:07.322
Dad!

01:14:07.485 --> 01:14:09.613
Dad, answer me!

01:14:14.533 --> 01:14:15.625
Ouch.

01:14:15.785 --> 01:14:19.130
You've gotta help me find my dad.
We need him to help us.

01:14:19.288 --> 01:14:20.631
Hand me the padlock.

01:14:20.790 --> 01:14:22.258
Aren't you listening to me?

01:14:22.416 --> 01:14:25.135
Yes, and I said,
hand me the padlock!

01:14:26.379 --> 01:14:29.474
- Here! You're gonna be sorry.
- I hope not.

01:14:47.984 --> 01:14:49.361
Megan.

01:14:50.319 --> 01:14:53.448
Megan, get back to the
cabin with the kids.

01:14:53.614 --> 01:14:54.991
Megan, please!

01:14:55.199 --> 01:14:58.544
- Wait a minute. You can't do this.
- Get back in there before it's too late.

01:15:07.753 --> 01:15:09.221
Megan, no!

01:15:09.755 --> 01:15:11.428
Megan!

01:15:11.841 --> 01:15:15.015
Megan! Megan, no!

01:15:15.261 --> 01:15:17.013
Jason!

01:15:24.520 --> 01:15:26.272
Jason!

01:15:26.439 --> 01:15:28.567
Jason, come on!

01:15:28.733 --> 01:15:31.862
Come and get me! It's
me you want, remember?

01:15:42.955 --> 01:15:45.799
That's it. Come on,
maggot-head. Come on!

01:15:45.958 --> 01:15:48.711
Come on, maggot-head.
That's it, come on!

01:16:00.264 --> 01:16:01.516
Tommy!

01:16:02.391 --> 01:16:03.688
Get out of there!

01:16:03.851 --> 01:16:05.728
Hurry!

01:16:06.187 --> 01:16:08.315
Hey, asshole!

01:16:08.481 --> 01:16:11.200
It's me you want,
remember? Come on!

01:16:11.358 --> 01:16:12.826
Come on, chickenshit.

01:16:12.985 --> 01:16:16.535
Come on, I'm standing here
waiting. Come on, you pussy!

01:19:00.236 --> 01:19:01.453
No!

01:19:54.373 --> 01:19:56.341
Is he killed?

01:19:59.461 --> 01:20:01.259
Stay here.

01:22:31.113 --> 01:22:33.241
All right! Yeah!

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.002
It's over.

01:22:45.586 --> 01:22:47.759
It's finally over.

01:22:48.589 --> 01:22:50.842
Jason's home.

01:23:46.416 --> 01:23:48.792
<i>You're with your baby</i>

01:23:48.793 --> 01:23:52.922
<i>And you're parked alone
on a summer night</i>

01:23:52.923 --> 01:23:57.551
<i>You're deep in love but
you're deeper in the woods</i>

01:23:57.552 --> 01:24:00.380
<i>You think you're doing all right</i>

01:24:02.891 --> 01:24:04.934
<i>Did you hear that voice?</i>

01:24:04.935 --> 01:24:09.146
<i>Did you see that face
or was it just a dream?</i>

01:24:09.147 --> 01:24:13.943
<i>This can't be real,
that only happens, babe,</i>

01:24:13.944 --> 01:24:16.229
<i>On the movie screen</i>

01:24:18.156 --> 01:24:20.532
<i>Oh, but he's back</i>

01:24:20.533 --> 01:24:24.578
<i>He's the man behind the mask</i>

01:24:24.579 --> 01:24:26.872
<i>And he's out of control</i>

01:24:26.873 --> 01:24:28.832
<i>He's back</i>

01:24:28.833 --> 01:24:32.287
<i>The man behind the mask</i>

01:24:33.088 --> 01:24:38.626
<i>And he crawled out of his hole</i>

01:24:40.595 --> 01:24:44.932
<i>You're swimming with your
girl out on Lover's Lake</i>

01:24:44.933 --> 01:24:47.268
<i>And the wind blows cold</i>

01:24:47.269 --> 01:24:51.014
<i>It chills your bones but
you're still on the make</i>

01:24:51.898 --> 01:24:54.225
<i>That's a bad mistake</i>

01:24:56.236 --> 01:24:58.862
<i>Ah, but the moon was full</i>

01:24:58.863 --> 01:25:02.866
<i>And you had a chance
to be all alone</i>

01:25:02.867 --> 01:25:04.910
<i>But you're not alone</i>

01:25:04.911 --> 01:25:07.405
<i>This is your last dance</i>

01:25:08.290 --> 01:25:10.992
<i>And your last romance</i>

01:25:12.294 --> 01:25:14.670
<i>Yeah, cos he's back</i>

01:25:14.671 --> 01:25:18.882
<i>He's the man behind the mask</i>

01:25:18.883 --> 01:25:21.135
<i>And he's out of control</i>

01:25:21.136 --> 01:25:22.970
<i>He's back</i>

01:25:22.971 --> 01:25:26.424
<i>The man behind the mask</i>

01:25:26.975 --> 01:25:32.555
<i>And he crawled out of his hole</i>

01:25:50.373 --> 01:25:53.042
<i>Oh, if you see him coming</i>

01:25:53.043 --> 01:25:55.419
<i>Get away if you can</i>

01:25:55.420 --> 01:25:59.173
<i>Just keep on running,
run as fast as you can</i>

01:25:59.174 --> 01:26:04.671
<i>He's a dangerous, dangerous man</i>

01:26:05.096 --> 01:26:07.181
<i>And he's out tonight</i>

01:26:07.182 --> 01:26:09.099
<i>And he's watching you</i>

01:26:09.100 --> 01:26:11.427
<i>And he knows your house</i>

01:26:13.939 --> 01:26:16.599
<i>No, don't turn out the lights</i>

01:26:18.443 --> 01:26:20.986
<i>Yeah, cos he's back</i>

01:26:20.987 --> 01:26:24.823
<i>He's the man behind the mask</i>

01:26:24.824 --> 01:26:27.159
<i>And he's out of control</i>

01:26:27.160 --> 01:26:29.161
<i>He's back</i>

01:26:29.162 --> 01:26:32.873
<i>The man behind the mask</i>

01:26:32.874 --> 01:26:35.209
<i>And he's after your soul</i>

01:26:35.210 --> 01:26:36.961
<i>He's back</i>

01:26:36.962 --> 01:26:40.881
<i>He's the man behind the mask</i>

01:26:40.882 --> 01:26:43.300
<i>And he's out of control</i>

01:26:43.301 --> 01:26:45.219
<i>He's back</i>

01:26:45.220 --> 01:26:49.014
<i>The man behind the mask</i>

01:26:49.015 --> 01:26:51.267
<i>And he's after your soul</i>

01:26:51.268 --> 01:26:52.768
<i>He's back</i>

01:26:52.769 --> 01:26:56.897
<i>He's the man behind the mask</i>

01:26:56.898 --> 01:26:59.142
<i>And he's out of control...</i>
