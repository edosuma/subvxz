<i>Kingdom come,</i>
Superman versus Shazam.

00:09.449 --> 00:10.883
- Really good one.
- Mm-hmm.

00:10.917 --> 00:12.249
I'm gonna go with
The Thing versus Hulk.

00:12.283 --> 00:14.885
One of my all-time
favorite adversaries.

00:14.920 --> 00:16.085
Superman, Batman.

00:16.119 --> 00:18.049
It's the obvious one.
From what issue?

00:18.083 --> 00:19.247
From, um...

00:19.281 --> 00:21.279
I don't know,
what issue was that?

00:21.313 --> 00:23.575
- <i>Dark Knight Returns</i> number 4.
- Yes.

00:23.609 --> 00:25.175
Did you read it?

00:25.210 --> 00:27.910
No, I heard about it.
It's next on the list.

your all-time greatest battles

00:29.610 --> 00:30.775
and you haven't
even witnessed it?

00:30.810 --> 00:33.275
I know,
I heard about it third-hand.

00:33.309 --> 00:34.809
I did, yeah.
I heard about it third-hand.

00:34.843 --> 00:36.142
All right,
you're out of the running.

what your thoughts are on it.

00:37.576 --> 00:38.542

00:38.577 --> 00:41.144
Me versus my dad
any given night.

[Laughter]

01:55.291 --> 01:56.258
Mine's always been
<i>Nightmare On Elm Street.</i>

01:56.292 --> 01:57.291
The first one.

01:57.326 --> 01:58.326
That one's always
freaked me out.

01:58.360 --> 02:00.428
The notion
of devil worship films

02:00.462 --> 02:02.229
were terrifying to me,
'cause I was catholic.

02:02.263 --> 02:04.664
My favorite of that genre
is <i>Race With The Devil,</i>

02:04.699 --> 02:07.001
where Peter Fonda
and Warren Oates

02:07.035 --> 02:09.570
witness a ritual killing
in the woods.

02:09.604 --> 02:11.705

being chased by satanists

02:11.739 --> 02:12.973
in a winnebago.

02:13.007 --> 02:14.308
Terrifying.

02:14.342 --> 02:16.043
Instead of just trying
to get away from the satanists,

02:16.077 --> 02:18.178
they stop at a library
to research satanism.

Think about it, man--
like, that movie today--

02:20.815 --> 02:22.749
essentially they wouldn't
even have to stop at a library.

02:22.783 --> 02:24.150
They could just, like--
while they're being chased

02:24.184 --> 02:25.551
they could Google.

02:25.585 --> 02:26.952
They could probably tweet
the people chasing them, like,

02:26.986 --> 02:28.186
"leave us alone."

You've been looking
for this one for a while?

Is it, like, a holy grail?
Yeah, a little bit.

03:05.953 --> 03:07.120
How long have
you been looking?

03:07.154 --> 03:09.288
Pretty much since
I started collecting.

03:09.323 --> 03:10.823
Like, a year and a half ago.

03:10.857 --> 03:12.691
I'm pretty new at it myself.

when he was young.

03:14.193 --> 03:16.360

you have that in common, though.

03:18.029 --> 03:19.363
Yeah, it's nice.

of us here before we got married

03:21.332 --> 03:22.965
had the big rooms
full of collectibles.

03:23.000 --> 03:26.168
Then we got married, had kids.
It shrunk down, shrunk down.

03:26.203 --> 03:29.237
My wife would be, like, "this
is where we eat and I don't want

03:29.272 --> 03:31.073
to look at Wolverine
while I'm eating."

03:31.107 --> 03:33.308

makes me hungry. I don't know.

one thing that stops anybody

03:38.881 --> 03:40.481
from buying comic books.

03:40.516 --> 03:43.817
- Well, maybe two things.
- Bullets?

03:43.852 --> 03:45.585

03:45.620 --> 03:47.020

somebody going, like,

03:47.054 --> 03:48.721
"you don't need that, what
are you gonna do with that?"

03:48.756 --> 03:50.156
Exactly, yeah.

03:50.190 --> 03:53.292
Oh, that's the enemy
of all comic book stores, man.

03:53.326 --> 03:54.827
It was the woman
who wanted the books.

03:54.861 --> 03:56.194
- Who wanted the book?
- Yes.

03:56.229 --> 03:57.662
She wanted it so--
she wanted a <i>giant-size X-Men.</i>

03:57.696 --> 04:00.131
- She's gotta have it.
- You gave it to her.

04:00.165 --> 04:01.299
Yeah. I did.

04:02.334 --> 04:03.868

04:03.902 --> 04:06.104

is this going for?

04:06.138 --> 04:08.840
- It's about a $900 book.
- Right.

like a huge <i>X-Men</i> fan.

04:10.810 --> 04:12.278

04:13.580 --> 04:15.280
- No, I would like those.
- We have those here.

04:15.315 --> 04:16.714
- You guys have those around?
- We do.

04:16.749 --> 04:18.851
Ooh, ooh,
we all know what that is.

04:18.885 --> 04:22.855
Hulk 180 is the first appearance
of Wolverine ever in comics.

04:22.889 --> 04:24.557

last panel?

04:24.591 --> 04:25.991
Last panel.

04:26.026 --> 04:29.695
And then 181 is the first
full-fledged Wolverine enters

04:29.729 --> 04:31.497
the Marvel universe,
and he's wearing--

04:31.531 --> 04:33.365
It kind of looks like
the Wolverine costume,

04:33.400 --> 04:36.101
but a very Halloween costume
version of it.

04:36.136 --> 04:37.569
Yeah.

04:37.603 --> 04:38.570
Doesn't look like
classic wolvie,

04:38.604 --> 04:39.571
but you can see wolvie
in there.

04:39.605 --> 04:40.739

the holy grail of comics here.

the damage on these?

- Do you wanna do a package?
- Possibly.

'Cause I'm willing
to make a deal.

05:54.151 --> 05:56.752
And you'll probably
laugh in my face,

05:56.787 --> 06:00.923
but I was thinking
more like 1,200.

06:00.957 --> 06:02.424
- No, I couldn't do that.
- Yeah.

06:02.458 --> 06:05.727
- I wouldn't laugh in your face,
but, no, unfortunately I--

06:05.761 --> 06:08.062
- the bottom number is--
- The bottom number is 16.

06:08.097 --> 06:09.931
- 16.
- Yeah.

06:09.965 --> 06:11.832
16 for all three?
Or just these two?

06:11.867 --> 06:14.368
- 17 for all three.
- Okay.

06:14.402 --> 06:16.336
Actually this is a $300 book.

06:16.371 --> 06:17.571
Right.

06:17.605 --> 06:20.574
So you're getting
a substantial savings.

06:23.978 --> 06:25.512

taking all the credit.

07:28.744 --> 07:30.979
- Did you have any, uh--?
- I had some input.

07:31.013 --> 07:33.148
What was it-- A 50/50, 60/40?
Just give me a percentage.

07:33.182 --> 07:34.916

of this sale.

07:34.950 --> 07:37.351
- Who takes more credit here?
- 85/15.

- 85/15, you?
- In your favor?

07:39.488 --> 07:40.821
Yeah, but I'm giving
it to me 'cause--

07:40.856 --> 07:41.922
- Whoa!
- Thank you.

07:41.957 --> 07:43.324
You're welcome.

07:43.358 --> 07:44.459
It would have been useful
if you didn't tell us

07:44.493 --> 07:46.061
that he did the poor job.

07:46.095 --> 07:47.663
- True, but you know--

07:47.698 --> 07:49.399
You're, like, "he sucked,
but I'm throwing him this bone

07:49.433 --> 07:50.633
'cause he needs a job."

TV show, movies,

08:03.383 --> 08:05.484
anyplace superman has appeared,

08:05.518 --> 08:08.486
do they ever show him
using the bathroom?

08:08.521 --> 08:10.622
No, I've never
seen it addressed.

08:10.656 --> 08:12.891
I mean, his digestive system
is Kryptonian.

08:12.925 --> 08:13.992
It's not a human being.

08:14.026 --> 08:15.326
Say there's,
like, just a little bit.

08:15.361 --> 08:17.662
Like a couple rabbit pellets
drop out once in a while.

08:17.696 --> 08:19.030
Right.

08:19.064 --> 08:20.665
Do you think you could,
like, use them to fuel, like,

08:20.700 --> 08:22.567
a nuclear power plant
for, like, ten years?

08:22.602 --> 08:24.303
- I would think so, yeah.
- Just one superman dropping.

08:24.337 --> 08:26.205
If terrorists got a hold
of superman's crap

08:26.240 --> 08:28.675
you could probably
take out an entire country.

08:28.709 --> 08:30.443
- Scat bomb.

they did vampires in <i>Twilight?</i>

08:41.490 --> 08:44.158
Well, we need to do
a zombie teenage romance.

08:44.193 --> 08:45.860
Kids falling in love
and falling apart

08:45.895 --> 08:47.528
at the same time.

08:47.563 --> 08:50.231
Right, but a zombie's
constantly decomposing.

08:50.265 --> 08:53.166
Vampires are traditionally,
like, super good-looking.

08:53.201 --> 08:54.301
Right.

08:54.335 --> 08:55.635
You know,
tom cruise was a vampire.

08:55.670 --> 08:57.404
Frank Langella was a vampire.

08:57.438 --> 09:00.072
[Laughter]

09:00.106 --> 09:01.273
- That's your go-to dude?

09:01.308 --> 09:04.109
You're, like,
Tom Cruise, Frank Langella.

09:04.144 --> 09:07.746
These are the Draculas
we all know!

09:07.780 --> 09:09.181
You admit zombies
are huge, right?

09:09.215 --> 09:11.249
People are in love
with zombies right now.

09:11.284 --> 09:13.351
So let's use that
to promote the store then.

09:13.386 --> 09:14.486
"Zombie day."

09:14.520 --> 09:17.389
Everything in the store,
20% off for one day.

09:17.423 --> 09:20.025
With an awesome looking flyer
featuring the four of us

09:20.059 --> 09:23.562
dressed up as zombies,
blood dripping off of us, decay.

09:23.596 --> 09:24.963
I wanna get, like,
a makeup artist in here

09:24.998 --> 09:26.198
with prosthetics.

09:26.232 --> 09:27.533
The picture
of us dressed as zombies,

09:27.567 --> 09:28.534
that'll draw them in.

09:28.568 --> 09:29.768
The big thing
that says "20% off,"

09:29.803 --> 09:31.170
that'll keep 'em here.

09:31.204 --> 09:33.772
So once people get here,
we're not zombies?

09:33.806 --> 09:34.773
Right.

09:34.807 --> 09:36.041
You know what
this reminds me of?

09:36.075 --> 09:37.108
What?

09:37.143 --> 09:39.912
The Spanish debacle.

09:39.946 --> 09:42.181
Ming, uh, will
try to run promotions.

09:42.215 --> 09:44.249
He has had some success
in the past,

09:44.284 --> 09:47.252
but let's say more non-successes
with promotions.

09:47.287 --> 09:49.788
I'm kind of drawing
a blank here on the successes.

09:49.823 --> 09:52.992
The ones I remember
are putting the ad

09:53.026 --> 09:54.961
in the Spanish newspaper

09:54.995 --> 09:56.963
for, like, what--
A month straight daily?

09:56.998 --> 09:59.265
There's a large
Latin population in this town.

09:59.300 --> 10:00.667
Yeah.

10:00.702 --> 10:01.936
I thought we could take
advantage, hit that population.

10:01.970 --> 10:03.237
We sell comics in English.

10:03.271 --> 10:04.304
So if they
come in they're, like,

10:04.339 --> 10:05.572
"Do you have any comics
in Spanish?"

10:05.606 --> 10:06.773
And you're, like, "No."

10:06.808 --> 10:09.376
But our flyer's in Spanish.
[Laughter]

10:09.410 --> 10:11.478
- It sounds murky.
- It's not murky.

10:11.513 --> 10:14.348
It's very cut and dry.
Trust me.

10:14.382 --> 10:16.750
Fine.
Just... do something.

10:16.784 --> 10:18.318
All right.

10:18.353 --> 10:20.520
Whoa, looks like
you got a Godzilla there.

10:20.555 --> 10:21.688
Something that doesn't
look quite right.

10:21.723 --> 10:22.656
It looks like...

10:22.690 --> 10:25.025
Oh, my God.

10:25.059 --> 10:26.426
Remember you told me
that you're looking

10:26.461 --> 10:27.561
for original artwork?

10:27.595 --> 10:28.996
We brought some pages
for you to look at.

10:29.030 --> 10:30.764
No way! No way!

10:37.190 --> 10:38.657
- How you doin'?
- Hi.

10:38.692 --> 10:41.360
I'm actually looking
to talk to someone about

10:41.394 --> 10:42.662
trying to sell some stuff.

10:42.696 --> 10:44.763
Whoa, looks like
you got a Godzilla there, huh?

10:44.798 --> 10:46.199
- Yeah.
- All right, man.

10:46.233 --> 10:49.569
Let's take it out of the box,
let's take a look at it.

10:56.744 --> 10:59.012
- You guys a couple, or--
- Yeah, we're engaged.

10:59.046 --> 11:00.380
- Congrats.
- Congratulations.

11:00.414 --> 11:02.015
Thanks, we're looking
to try and get some money

11:02.049 --> 11:03.182
to help pay for the wedding.

11:03.217 --> 11:04.751
Oh, yeah?
Where'd you get it from?

11:04.785 --> 11:06.219
My dad, like,
during Christmas.

11:06.254 --> 11:07.788
Like, almost 20 years ago.

11:07.822 --> 11:10.390
It is one of the nicest pieces
of Godzilla merchandise

11:10.424 --> 11:11.758
I've seen me
through the door here.

11:11.793 --> 11:14.428
The only thing is
is I'm not exactly sure

11:14.462 --> 11:15.495
what its value is.

11:15.530 --> 11:16.797
- Right.
- Okay.

11:16.831 --> 11:19.466
I know a guy in town
who's a Godzilla expert.

11:19.500 --> 11:21.067
Let me give him a call,
I'll get right back to you.

11:21.101 --> 11:22.168
Okay.

11:22.202 --> 11:23.269
Roberto.

11:23.303 --> 11:24.437
Walt at the stash.

11:24.471 --> 11:25.805
You got a few seconds
to come down

11:25.839 --> 11:28.875
and check out a piece?

11:31.779 --> 11:33.547
Oh, here he is-- Robert.

11:33.581 --> 11:36.583
Hey, guys?

11:36.618 --> 11:38.252
You know what year
this is from, right?

11:38.286 --> 11:40.388
I think it's, like, '93, '94.

11:40.422 --> 11:42.156
- You got a box on the floor?
- Yeah.

11:42.191 --> 11:44.258
'Cause the box
is a sure giveaway.

11:44.293 --> 11:46.895
Like, right here it says "1991."

11:46.929 --> 11:48.030
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh.

11:48.064 --> 11:49.631
So this is called
"Heisei Godzilla."

11:49.666 --> 11:52.000
Heisei was a style,
like, post Showa.

11:52.035 --> 11:54.002
Showa was from '54 to '80.

11:54.036 --> 11:55.637
And then from '80 on
it's called Heisei.

11:55.672 --> 11:58.040
And he was actually
the more carnivore--

11:58.074 --> 12:00.042
It's almost got,
like, a cat-like style

12:00.077 --> 12:01.477
with the fangs.

12:01.512 --> 12:04.781
Godzilla versus King Ghidorah
was actually the first time

12:04.815 --> 12:05.949
they used this style.

12:05.984 --> 12:07.818
That's the film
where they got the Dorats.

12:07.852 --> 12:09.320
Yeah, when they went
back in time to Monster Island.

12:09.354 --> 12:10.554
- When Godzilla first--
- Yeah, that was crazy.

12:10.589 --> 12:11.956
Yeah, that was just
a goofy storyline.

12:11.990 --> 12:14.592
Who's your favorite,
uh, giant monster?

12:14.627 --> 12:17.662
Just visually speaking,
I've always liked MechaGodzilla.

12:17.696 --> 12:20.131
A robot version of Godzilla.

12:20.165 --> 12:22.767
- Who do you choose, man?
- King Ghidorah.

12:22.801 --> 12:26.169
The three-headed space dragon
that wanders the galaxy

12:26.204 --> 12:29.706
looking for worlds to destroy
until he came upon Earth.

12:29.740 --> 12:31.340
Why does that appeal to you?

12:31.375 --> 12:32.875
You're, like, "I love
the characters that just wanna

12:32.909 --> 12:34.710
[bleep] Up everyone
else's lives!"

12:34.744 --> 12:36.478
[Laughter]

12:36.512 --> 12:38.146
What were you
thinking it was worth?

12:38.180 --> 12:40.549
I saw online
for, like, up to 900.

12:40.583 --> 12:42.985
No, this figure
never sold for $900.

12:43.019 --> 12:44.920
New they probably went for

12:44.955 --> 12:48.992
$150 to $175 range.

12:49.026 --> 12:50.794
You didn't play with it
very much.

12:50.828 --> 12:53.530
But there's something that
doesn't look quite right here.

12:55.032 --> 12:58.001
It looks like...

12:58.035 --> 13:00.870
Somebody glued this
at one point.

13:00.904 --> 13:02.238
Oh.

13:02.272 --> 13:06.108
Somebody hot-glued it.
'Cause it normally would turn.

13:06.143 --> 13:07.510
Did you break this
when you were a kid?

13:07.544 --> 13:10.379
I mean-- I think,
like, it was broken

13:10.414 --> 13:12.715
when I was, you know, a kid
and my dad said he fixed it.

13:12.750 --> 13:14.984
So you were trying
to pass off a broken toy.

13:15.019 --> 13:16.219
I didn't know.

13:16.254 --> 13:17.921
You didn't know?
You just said you knew.

13:17.955 --> 13:19.589
I mean I didn't know
it was gonna affect the price.

13:19.624 --> 13:21.024
[Laughs]

13:21.059 --> 13:22.793
Everything affects prices.

13:22.827 --> 13:24.762
I mean, you don't
buy a beat up car expecting

13:24.796 --> 13:26.731
to pay full value, do you?

13:26.765 --> 13:30.168
I mean, no.

13:30.202 --> 13:33.339
So you're looking at a toy
missing a tag.

13:33.373 --> 13:34.774
No clean box.

13:34.808 --> 13:37.310
But you did say that you
were really interested in it.

13:37.344 --> 13:38.277
I actually-- Yeah.

13:38.311 --> 13:39.511
Do I want it?
Sure, I want it.

13:39.546 --> 13:41.246
I mean, I got
a perfect place for it.

13:41.280 --> 13:44.315
I've got about
50 Godzilla toys.

13:44.349 --> 13:46.717
Robert, if you want it,
feel free to negotiate.

13:49.086 --> 13:50.487
It's hard enough
to move this kind of piece

13:50.521 --> 13:52.221
at that price anyway.

13:52.256 --> 13:53.456
It's gotta be mint, in box.

13:53.490 --> 13:55.825
No broken tail, so I'm out.

13:55.859 --> 13:57.192
It's the best
of both worlds for you.

13:57.227 --> 13:59.495
You don't have to risk a dime
and you get to watch

13:59.529 --> 14:01.030
a master in action.

14:01.064 --> 14:02.966
I get to see him operate.

14:03.000 --> 14:04.000
He gets to lay back
and enjoy it.

14:04.034 --> 14:05.168
Yeah.

14:05.202 --> 14:06.636
Did you ever
think of eloping?

14:06.670 --> 14:08.805
Especially since you're not
gonna make much off of this.

14:08.840 --> 14:10.841
I probably could
go as much as 125,

14:10.875 --> 14:14.711
but that would be my rock.

14:14.746 --> 14:16.880
Gosh, man.
This is rough.

14:16.915 --> 14:18.281
It's not gonna go anywhere,
and with a broken tail

14:18.316 --> 14:21.618
it's probably
about the value of it.

14:21.653 --> 14:24.956
If you leave here
and if we advertise it online--

14:24.990 --> 14:26.157
- you put it online.
- Right.

14:26.191 --> 14:27.959
- It gets bid on.
- Right.

14:27.994 --> 14:31.296
High bidder gives you $65
and you ship it to my house.

14:31.331 --> 14:32.631
[Laughs]

14:32.666 --> 14:34.266
'Cause odds are
that's what would happen.

14:34.300 --> 14:36.669
But I mean I'm just thinking
that I would feel comfortable

14:36.703 --> 14:38.537
with 200.

14:38.572 --> 14:41.474
I'd do 150 and that's it,
that's my rock.

14:41.508 --> 14:44.410
Even at $150,
it's, like, too much.

14:44.445 --> 14:46.412
What about you?
What are you comfortable with?

14:46.446 --> 14:48.014
I mean, I'm not comfortable...

14:48.048 --> 14:50.150
I think he's just comfortable
whatever she's comfortable with.

14:50.184 --> 14:52.986
I think he's just not
comfortable selling it at all.

14:53.021 --> 14:54.788
And the fact
that we're getting an offer

14:54.822 --> 14:56.790
that's so much less,
I mean-- I'm so sorry.

14:56.824 --> 14:59.926
Look, I'll tell you--
I'll meet you halfway, 175.

15:01.562 --> 15:03.396
- It's going in my collection.
- It's really-- You know what?

15:03.430 --> 15:05.965
- It's totally up to you, hon.
- What's more important?

15:05.999 --> 15:07.032
Godzilla in a box

15:07.066 --> 15:11.236
or girlfriend
in a wedding dress?

15:11.270 --> 15:12.637
Aw.

15:12.671 --> 15:15.673
So what do you say, 175?

15:17.709 --> 15:19.577
- We'll go for 175.
- Sold, 175.

15:19.611 --> 15:22.080
- Thank you, thank you.
- Rob, pay the lady.

15:22.114 --> 15:24.215
[Laughs]

15:24.250 --> 15:25.483
No offense, you guys,

15:25.518 --> 15:26.852
but you're not invited
to the wedding.

15:26.886 --> 15:28.319
- Oh!
- That's harsh.

15:28.354 --> 15:29.988
But we might send you
a plate of something.

15:30.022 --> 15:31.022
- There you go.
- Thank you.

15:31.057 --> 15:32.257
- As a thank you.
- No, we won't.

15:32.292 --> 15:34.092
- No problem, thanks.
- Bye, thank you.

15:34.127 --> 15:35.093
- Bye.
- Take care.

15:35.128 --> 15:36.228
So I'm actually
kind of psyched.

15:36.262 --> 15:37.462
Honestly how often
are you gonna grab that

15:37.497 --> 15:39.097
and twist it around?

15:39.131 --> 15:40.131
I'm never
gonna touch it again.

15:40.165 --> 15:41.799
Thanks, guys.
Thank you very much.

15:41.834 --> 15:43.234
No problem, rob.
I owe you lunch again.

Not a problem.

16:52.170 --> 16:54.772
just so he can fulfill some
sort of weird zombie fetish.

16:54.806 --> 16:55.840
[Laughs]

16:55.874 --> 16:57.942
I just wanna
strangle him sometimes.

16:57.976 --> 17:00.611
Squeeze the life
right out of his face.

17:00.646 --> 17:03.547
[Laughter]

17:03.582 --> 17:04.882
How awesome is this?

17:04.915 --> 17:07.717
Uh, I just don't see
this manifesting itself

17:07.751 --> 17:09.919
into the sales you dream of.

17:09.953 --> 17:11.954
You've crapped on every idea
I've ever come up with.

17:11.989 --> 17:13.356
So I'm at the point where--

17:13.390 --> 17:15.624
In all fairness to Walt,
none have worked so far.

17:15.657 --> 17:16.790
[Laughter]

17:16.826 --> 17:18.026
Get your asses in the chair.

17:18.060 --> 17:20.395
Me and Mike will
watch the counter, let's go.

17:20.429 --> 17:23.897
What's the best makeup job
you've ever seen theatrically?

17:23.933 --> 17:27.167
Um, I thought heath ledger's
makeup as the joker

17:27.203 --> 17:29.037
with those horrible scars--
but it looked real.

17:29.071 --> 17:30.138
You bought it.

17:30.172 --> 17:32.039
If you were twisted,
you might do that.

17:32.074 --> 17:34.275
Well, he wasn't, like,
the meticulous crazy guy...

17:34.309 --> 17:35.542
Right.

17:35.577 --> 17:36.543
Who was, like,
spending hours and hours.

17:36.577 --> 17:38.378
He was, like,
Pfft! Pfft! Unh!

17:38.413 --> 17:39.379
[Laughter]

17:39.414 --> 17:41.181
Which is even more terrifying.

17:41.215 --> 17:42.816
But you gotta give it up
to <i>apes</i> too back in the day.

17:42.850 --> 17:44.417
I mean, I first saw that movie
when I was a kid,

17:44.452 --> 17:46.119
and the first time
they zoom into--

17:46.153 --> 17:47.520
- The cornfield?
- Yes!

17:47.555 --> 17:49.222
When the gorilla's
on the horseback

17:49.256 --> 17:50.590
and they just turn around
and then turn

17:50.624 --> 17:51.924
and you see his face.

17:51.959 --> 17:55.228
As a kid you were, like,
that gorilla's wearing clothes!

17:55.262 --> 17:58.264
Like, we're all screwed!

18:19.754 --> 18:20.954
So this is our studio
for tonight.

18:20.989 --> 18:22.655
A have a photo
in mind entitled

18:22.690 --> 18:24.424
"Zombie Anal Breach Birth."

18:24.459 --> 18:26.726
[Laughter]

18:26.761 --> 18:28.795
Sashay!

18:30.831 --> 18:33.233
Look right at me.

18:33.267 --> 18:35.468
Look again right at me.
Yeah, you're good.

18:35.502 --> 18:40.172
No, higher, higher.

18:40.207 --> 18:42.240
- [Laughs]
- I love it.

18:42.275 --> 18:43.275
All right, we're done.

18:43.309 --> 18:44.643
All right,
was that fun or what?

18:44.677 --> 18:47.479
I can't lie, ming.
It was pretty damn cool.

18:47.513 --> 18:50.415
All right, so it went
from here today up to here.

18:50.449 --> 18:51.783
Well, let's not
get carried away.

18:51.817 --> 18:54.019
Flyers come out, we'll see
if it translates to sales.

18:54.053 --> 18:56.822
I got a good feeling
about this, ming.

18:56.856 --> 18:57.923
All right, grease up
the cash register.

18:57.957 --> 18:59.124
It's gonna be ringing.

18:59.158 --> 19:00.859
That drawer's gonna be
ming in and out,

19:00.893 --> 19:02.594
in and out, in and out.

19:02.629 --> 19:04.296
[Laughter]

19:04.331 --> 19:06.566
I got the flyers printed up.
I have one right here.

19:06.600 --> 19:08.034
Let me see.

19:08.068 --> 19:09.068
- You wanna see it?
- Yeah, yeah.

19:09.103 --> 19:11.271
Oh, my God!
That's cute, man.

19:11.306 --> 19:12.740
Look, you hit both movies.

19:12.774 --> 19:14.575
<i>Day Of The Dead</i>
and <i>The Walking Dead.</i>

19:14.609 --> 19:16.210
- Yeah.
- And said "deal."

19:16.245 --> 19:18.312
Look, we're exploiting
the zombie trend.

19:18.347 --> 19:20.081
[Laughter]

19:20.115 --> 19:21.482
It wasn't an easy day.

19:21.517 --> 19:22.684
It was a pain.

19:22.718 --> 19:23.952
I mean, that stuff
didn't come off,

19:23.986 --> 19:25.854
it was days later,
I was still picking pieces

19:25.888 --> 19:28.456
of rubber cement off my scalp.

19:28.491 --> 19:30.524
This sounds like
you can't win.

19:30.559 --> 19:32.026
He's, like,
"You! Bring in more business!"

19:32.060 --> 19:34.828
And you try-- He's, like, "You!
This makeup hurts my baby skin!"

19:34.863 --> 19:35.829
[Laughter]

19:35.864 --> 19:37.331
- I can't win.
- No, dude.

19:37.365 --> 19:39.366
But you gotta keep struggling.
Life's about the struggle.

19:39.400 --> 19:41.168
The struggle against
Walter Flanagan.

19:41.202 --> 19:42.503
That's right, would you rather
I just did nothing,

19:42.537 --> 19:43.771
or would you rather
I take the initiative

19:43.805 --> 19:44.972
and at least try?

19:45.006 --> 19:45.973
I'd rather
you took the initiative,

19:46.008 --> 19:47.308
but left me out of it.

19:47.342 --> 19:48.976
[Laughter]

19:49.010 --> 19:50.378
You know what, dude?
You gotta come out wt with me.

19:50.412 --> 19:51.913
- It's all pats on the back.
- Yeah?

19:51.947 --> 19:54.482
Yeah, it's never, like,
"You screwed up again, Ming."

19:54.517 --> 19:55.817
So you've been
out there too long.

19:55.852 --> 19:57.653
- You forgot your east coast--
- I got no edge.

19:57.687 --> 19:59.621
I'm just like,
"Everything's good!"

19:59.656 --> 20:01.457
I'm too much of a stoner, man.
I'm just like,

20:01.491 --> 20:03.192
"It's fine, it'll pass.

20:03.226 --> 20:05.461
Let's all go eat."

20:05.496 --> 20:06.796
Hey, Walt.
You're gonna wanna see these.

20:06.831 --> 20:08.765
Oh!

20:08.799 --> 20:10.033
Oh, my God.

20:10.068 --> 20:11.268
Where did you get this?

20:11.302 --> 20:12.670
- At an old-time
comic convention

20:12.704 --> 20:14.038
back in the late '80s.

20:14.072 --> 20:15.039
I don't even wanna tell you
what I paid for them.

20:15.073 --> 20:16.840
What are they worth now?

20:26.330 --> 20:28.965
Did you get caught up
in the, uh, '70s Kung Fu craze?

20:29.000 --> 20:30.300
Uh, who didn't?

20:30.334 --> 20:31.501
- Did it ever come in handy?
- Once.

20:31.535 --> 20:32.969
I only got into
one fight in my life.

20:33.004 --> 20:34.404
And the result?

20:34.438 --> 20:37.174
I got my jaw broken,
but I kicked his ass.

20:37.208 --> 20:38.175
So it was a draw.

20:38.209 --> 20:39.543
[Laughs]

20:39.577 --> 20:40.577
You really
got your jaw broken?

20:40.611 --> 20:41.645
- Mm-hmm.
- Are you serious?

20:41.679 --> 20:43.547
- Yeah.
- Were you drunk? Bar fight?

20:43.581 --> 20:45.682
Did you argue over Jean grey?
Greatest superhero?

20:45.717 --> 20:49.319
Yeah, 'cause I used
to get into ass-kicking fights

20:49.354 --> 20:50.687
over superheroes.

20:50.721 --> 20:52.455
Honestly, it wouldn't
shock me if you told me that.

20:52.490 --> 20:54.258
- No, actually--
- Come on, really.

20:54.292 --> 20:55.692
If someone threw down, like,

20:55.727 --> 20:57.928
"I think invisible girl
is better than Jean Grey."

20:57.962 --> 21:00.464
Is it that much of a shocker
if you strike a Bruce Lee pose

21:00.498 --> 21:02.166
over that?

21:04.736 --> 21:06.337
- Hello.
- Hi, how you doing?

21:06.371 --> 21:07.471
- Whoa.
- Whoo!

21:07.505 --> 21:08.805
I'm guessing
you wanna sell these?

21:08.840 --> 21:10.006
Yeah.

21:10.041 --> 21:12.008
My dad was a collector,
and he gave them to me

21:12.043 --> 21:13.810
for my 21st birthday,

21:13.845 --> 21:16.914
and he said that
I was to sell them

21:16.948 --> 21:19.216
if I ever needed money
to go back to school.

21:19.251 --> 21:20.284
Pretty awesome
birthday present.

21:20.318 --> 21:21.919
- Yeah.
- I got a wallet.

21:21.953 --> 21:23.454
My parents didn't even
put a dollar in it.

21:23.488 --> 21:25.456
What did you get
for your 21st birthday, Mike?

21:25.490 --> 21:27.224
My father kicked me
out of the house.

21:27.258 --> 21:29.159
[Laughter]

21:29.194 --> 21:31.896
Oh, man.

21:31.930 --> 21:32.997
Oh, this is awesome.

21:33.031 --> 21:35.900
Every key issue
from the 60s from Marvel.

21:35.934 --> 21:37.501
Ming, it's unbelievable.

21:37.535 --> 21:38.735
Look at the number
on that sucker.

21:38.770 --> 21:41.070
- Number two.
- <i>Spider-man</i> number two.

21:41.105 --> 21:42.772
Only to be topped
by number one.

21:48.612 --> 21:49.913
Deuce.

21:49.947 --> 21:51.248
It looks like it might
be in decent condition.

21:51.282 --> 21:55.419
The way it looks though,
it's got drips all over it.

21:55.453 --> 21:56.687
Oh!

21:56.721 --> 21:59.189
First appearance of Galactus
and Silver Surfer.

21:59.223 --> 22:02.025
That doesn't look like
it's in bad condition at all.

22:07.833 --> 22:09.500
- Oh!
- <i>Daredevil</i> number one.

22:09.535 --> 22:11.168
- Whoa.
- Oh, wow.

22:16.508 --> 22:18.543
Matt Murdoch, the blind
lawyer from hell's kitchen.

22:18.578 --> 22:20.279
He fights crime
by day and by night.

22:20.313 --> 22:21.713
That's the great
part about him.

22:21.748 --> 22:23.816
Well, he doesn't know
if it's day or night, does he?

22:23.850 --> 22:25.384
[Laughter]

22:25.418 --> 22:26.418
Well, I mean I'm sure there's

22:26.453 --> 22:28.287
someone there to tell him.

22:28.321 --> 22:31.457
It's such a key book
of course, but the condition--

22:31.491 --> 22:34.294
a professional grader
will really bring it down.

22:34.328 --> 22:37.430
I mean, the cover
is hanging on for dear life.

22:37.465 --> 22:39.299
What else you got?

22:39.333 --> 22:41.134
Oh!

22:41.169 --> 22:43.704
This is my favorite comic book
of all time right here.

22:49.510 --> 22:51.478
This is maybe
Stan Lee's finest hour.

22:51.512 --> 22:54.014
It's a story called
"This Man, This Monster."

22:54.048 --> 22:57.050
Where some man on the street
who's jealous

22:57.084 --> 22:59.619
of the fantastic four
uses a device that turns him

22:59.653 --> 23:01.020
into the thing.

23:01.054 --> 23:02.755
And then he goes
into the Baxter building

23:02.789 --> 23:04.757
to kill the fantastic four.

23:04.791 --> 23:06.058
Wow.

23:06.092 --> 23:08.727
This is the one
that made me go,

23:08.762 --> 23:11.030
"Forget Shakespeare, this is
the greatest story ever told."

23:11.064 --> 23:12.431
My Sunday school
classes were, like,

23:12.466 --> 23:13.900
"Well, no, that's not
the greatest story ever told."

23:13.934 --> 23:15.402
And I was just like,
"I don't think you've read it,

23:15.436 --> 23:16.703
'cause it is."

23:16.737 --> 23:17.971
[Laughs]

23:18.005 --> 23:19.672
Is there a greater friendship
in comic books than the

23:19.707 --> 23:22.176
Reed Richards-Ben Grimm
friendship?

23:22.210 --> 23:26.347
Reed Richards is always trying
to find a cu for Ben?

23:26.381 --> 23:27.849
Is that the basis?
Think about it.

23:27.883 --> 23:29.584
Reed Richards' mistake,
by bringing them out

23:29.618 --> 23:31.285
in outer space,
turned his best friend

23:31.320 --> 23:33.354
into an inhuman monster.

23:33.389 --> 23:34.455
Yes.

23:34.490 --> 23:35.924
But that inhuman monster
has such a heart

23:35.958 --> 23:38.626
and is such a great guy,
he never held it against Reed.

23:38.660 --> 23:39.627
Right.

23:39.661 --> 23:41.395
I just think that,
like, you know,

23:41.430 --> 23:44.565
Reed never forgives himself
for it, you know?

23:44.600 --> 23:45.866
Is he tortured?

23:45.900 --> 23:47.367
Is that why he's got
the gray on the sides?

23:47.402 --> 23:48.535
He's, like,
"Oh, I ruined Ben!"

23:48.570 --> 23:50.104
I think that could be why,
you know?

23:50.138 --> 23:51.605
I mean, it's a lot of stress.

23:51.640 --> 23:53.140
Do you think his wife
is ever, like,

23:53.174 --> 23:54.407
"What about me? You ruined me."
He's, like, "No, you look good.

23:54.442 --> 23:56.143
You're not like the rock guy.
Look at him."

23:56.177 --> 23:58.178
[Laughter]

23:58.212 --> 23:59.513
They are old,
and there are some

23:59.547 --> 24:02.183
very key issues in here,
but the conditions

24:02.217 --> 24:05.386
are going to bring
the prices down immensely.

24:05.420 --> 24:06.687
I understand that.

24:06.721 --> 24:08.955
These survived two childhoods,
my dad's and mine.

24:08.990 --> 24:11.291
- I read these.
- Oh, you're a fan?

24:11.326 --> 24:12.659
Yeah.

24:12.694 --> 24:14.327
I'm still one of the few girls
into any comic book shop

24:14.362 --> 24:15.729
I ever walk into.

24:15.763 --> 24:16.896
What would you say

24:16.931 --> 24:18.898
the breakdown
in secret stash is, Mike?

24:18.933 --> 24:22.769
99 guys for every girl
that comes in.

24:22.803 --> 24:24.604
It's like
a turkish bathhouse in here.

24:24.638 --> 24:26.706
- [Laughs]
- So, um...

24:26.741 --> 24:28.909
How much do you think college
is gonna cost you?

24:28.944 --> 24:31.746
College is gonna cost me
tens of thousands of dollars.

24:31.780 --> 24:34.415
- But any little bit helps.
- All right.

24:34.449 --> 24:36.083
Do you have any idea
what you're looking for

24:36.118 --> 24:37.385
for your collection?

24:37.419 --> 24:39.820
I don't, actually.

24:39.854 --> 24:43.691
My neighbor offered me,
like, 1,000 for it.

24:43.725 --> 24:45.860
For this box?
1,000?

24:45.894 --> 24:48.596
Yeah, I would imagine
you can get more than 1,000

24:48.630 --> 24:51.099
for the box, um...

24:51.133 --> 24:54.068
You're looking
at maybe eight grand.

24:54.102 --> 24:55.403
Oh, wow.

24:55.437 --> 24:56.670
Awesome.

24:56.705 --> 24:57.771
What you should do

24:57.805 --> 24:59.106
is get yourself
an overstreet price guide.

24:59.140 --> 25:01.974
Don't allow me, someone like me,
a store clerk to come in

25:02.009 --> 25:03.142
and make you an offer
on this box

25:03.176 --> 25:05.010
without getting
a little bit more educated

25:05.045 --> 25:06.512
on what you have in here.

25:06.546 --> 25:08.347
But I'm sure you'll field
some offers for this box.

25:08.381 --> 25:10.583
- It's that good.
- Awesome, thank you so much.

25:10.617 --> 25:11.917
- No problem.
- Thank you.

25:11.952 --> 25:13.452
- See you later.
- Take care.

25:13.487 --> 25:15.221
Were you more likely
to give her that advice

25:15.255 --> 25:16.388
'cause she's a female?

25:16.423 --> 25:18.290
Is that when your superhero
comes out?

25:18.324 --> 25:20.159
You, like, strike that stance,
you're, like,

25:20.193 --> 25:22.461
"Ma'am, you've got some nice
silver age books here.

25:22.495 --> 25:24.897
That douchebag down the street
is trying to do you wrong."

25:24.931 --> 25:26.131
[Laughs]

25:26.166 --> 25:27.600
I've gotta be honest,
I mean it's, like,

25:27.634 --> 25:29.101
when you're paying for
what you got, I don't even know.

25:29.135 --> 25:30.435
They're genderless?

25:30.470 --> 25:32.404
- All I know is just--
- I buy that on him.

25:32.439 --> 25:33.639
He sees dollar signs.

25:33.673 --> 25:36.074
He cares about dudes.
Andrew Jackson.

25:36.109 --> 25:37.576
- Ben Franklin.
- Benji.

25:37.610 --> 25:38.777
Batman.

25:38.811 --> 25:41.413
These are the men
he cares about.

26:14.579 --> 26:16.847
Any one of the iconic monsters
that are out there,

26:16.881 --> 26:18.315
which one would you guys be?

26:18.349 --> 26:20.417
Excuse me, what kind
of monster would I be?

26:20.451 --> 26:22.185
- You get to choose your curse.
- Mm-hmm.

26:22.219 --> 26:24.354
- You know, um,
a vampire, a werewolf--

26:24.388 --> 26:28.057
Right, right.
I mean, immediately I'm Dracula.

26:28.091 --> 26:31.027
You have the vampire brides--
It's always sexy time

26:31.061 --> 26:32.428
when you're Dracula.

26:32.462 --> 26:35.865
But there are some vampires
who really are conflicted

26:35.899 --> 26:37.934
about what they have to do
to survive, though.

26:37.968 --> 26:38.968
Mm-hmm.

26:39.003 --> 26:41.004
Can you feed on blood?

26:41.038 --> 26:42.839
Clearly I can feed
on anything.

26:42.874 --> 26:43.941
[Laughter]

26:43.975 --> 26:45.509
Anything.

26:45.543 --> 26:49.980
I ate a styrofoam cooler
earlier today.

26:50.015 --> 26:53.083
Blood is not a problem.

26:53.118 --> 26:54.518
- Hey.
- How'd it go?

26:54.553 --> 26:56.653
It was awesome.
I just blanketed red bank.

26:56.688 --> 26:58.021
So tomorrow's
the big day then, right?

26:58.056 --> 26:59.056
- Yeah.
- We're ready to rock?

26:59.090 --> 27:00.490
Extended hours?

27:00.525 --> 27:01.725
Yeah, we're gonna
stay open late.

27:01.759 --> 27:04.728
We're gonna stay open
as late as it takes.

27:04.763 --> 27:06.930
Look at that, man.
That is killer.

27:06.965 --> 27:09.399
Wow.
Oh, my God.

27:09.433 --> 27:12.068
This is it.
This is my holy grail.

27:14.463 --> 27:16.031
- Batman's just a guy.
- He's a vigilante.

27:16.065 --> 27:17.933
Yeah, we've all felt like,

27:17.967 --> 27:19.768
"Man, I wanna
avenge this injustice."

27:19.802 --> 27:21.503
So you sit there and, like,

27:21.537 --> 27:23.972
"I could do that.
Like, if I really got in shape

27:24.006 --> 27:26.475
and I had the right costume,
only went out at night."

27:26.509 --> 27:28.677
Me and this fool went
to Brookdale community college

27:28.711 --> 27:30.512
and took criminology courses.

27:30.547 --> 27:31.880
Because at one point
we were, like,

27:31.915 --> 27:33.582
"maybe we could, like,
fight crime in the area."

27:33.617 --> 27:37.120
And it wasn't even one class.
We took multiple law classes.

27:37.154 --> 27:39.355
Criminology,
juvenile justice.

27:39.390 --> 27:40.790
'Cause apparently
we were gonna take on

27:40.824 --> 27:43.226
the criminal underworld
in the teenage community.

27:43.260 --> 27:46.162
- That's where we started.
- And worked our way up.

27:46.196 --> 27:47.663
Like, we literally
thought about it,

27:47.698 --> 27:49.465
and we were just, like,
"You know, we wouldn't need,

27:49.500 --> 27:52.569
like, a whole bat cave, but
a secret garage would be nice."

27:52.603 --> 27:54.170
You know, we just do up
one of the cars

27:54.204 --> 27:55.572
and go out at night
and right wrongs.

27:55.606 --> 27:57.140
And what wrongs
were there to right?

27:57.174 --> 27:59.275
How old were you guys?

27:59.310 --> 28:01.410
25...

28:01.445 --> 28:02.478
[Laughter]

28:02.513 --> 28:04.213
I mean, it was
right before <i>Clerks.</i>

28:04.248 --> 28:06.282
Thank God <i>Clerks</i> happened,
cause otherwise me and him

28:06.316 --> 28:09.185
would be running around town
in masks.

28:16.129 --> 28:19.865
[Bell dings]

28:19.900 --> 28:21.934
- Hey, man, how you doing?
- Good, how are you?

28:21.969 --> 28:23.370
You need any help?
Looking for anything special?

28:23.404 --> 28:24.571
Yeah, I was looking
to see if you guys

28:24.605 --> 28:27.340
had the McFarlane
tortured souls?

28:27.375 --> 28:29.208
- Tortured souls.
- Yeah.

28:29.243 --> 28:30.543
We do have those ones.
Yeah, we do have them.

28:30.578 --> 28:31.644
Really?

28:31.679 --> 28:32.912
We got one set
of tortured souls.

28:32.947 --> 28:34.381
- You have the whole set?
- We got the whole set.

28:34.415 --> 28:36.583
They're probably the most
insane toy I've ever seen.

28:42.991 --> 28:47.262
They're literally toys
sculpted in the most heinous,

28:47.296 --> 28:51.700
grotesque, torture and agony.

28:51.734 --> 28:53.735
So you're into this stuff, huh?
You're into torture?

28:53.769 --> 28:54.836
A little S&M?

28:54.870 --> 28:57.405
- No, I just-- I had them.
- You had these?

28:57.440 --> 28:59.140
Yeah, I did, I had 'em all.

28:59.175 --> 29:01.543
My brothers and I
love this gross stuff.

29:01.577 --> 29:03.544
But I had
to get rid of them and--

29:03.579 --> 29:04.545
You had to get rid of them?

29:04.580 --> 29:06.548
- Yeah.
- Why?

29:06.582 --> 29:08.383
My girlfriend hated them,

29:08.417 --> 29:09.851
and I had to get rid of them.

29:09.885 --> 29:11.686
What, they're
just too creepy?

29:11.721 --> 29:13.355
She didn't like them.
She thought they were weird.

29:13.389 --> 29:14.422
Well, come on!

29:14.457 --> 29:16.958
You got a dude who's got, like,

29:16.993 --> 29:20.562
some sort of weird fetus
growing out of his groin.

29:20.596 --> 29:24.166
These tortured souls dolls
just never, never

29:24.200 --> 29:25.334
should have been made, man.

29:25.368 --> 29:26.735
They were made by--
What was it? McFarlane?

29:26.770 --> 29:29.037
McFarlane, based
on Clive Barker's designs.

29:29.072 --> 29:31.807
So you got Todd McFarlane
working from designs by

29:31.842 --> 29:35.178
Clive Barker, the very
twisted writer Clive Barker.

29:35.212 --> 29:37.013
And these dolls, man,
they were the kind of things

29:37.047 --> 29:38.248
that get people pissed.

29:38.282 --> 29:40.050
Were people pissed
when these dolls came out?

29:40.084 --> 29:41.718
There was definitely
some reaction to it.

29:41.753 --> 29:46.490
I mean, they are the most
horrific torture, um, bloody--

29:46.524 --> 29:49.826
Just grotesque looking dolls
that I've ever come across

29:49.860 --> 29:51.628
in collecting.

29:51.662 --> 29:54.130
Beyond, like, S&M type stuff.

29:54.165 --> 29:56.933
It's, like-- It truly
is like visions of hell,

29:56.967 --> 29:58.935
like, molded into plastic.

29:58.969 --> 30:00.169
Did you have them
in a closet,

30:00.203 --> 30:01.170
or did you have them
proudly displayed

30:01.204 --> 30:02.338
where everybody could see them?

30:02.372 --> 30:03.606
Proudly displayed.

30:03.640 --> 30:05.407
I had, like a mantle,
set them up in the place.

30:05.442 --> 30:06.942
Do you think, you know,
you could turn them, like--

30:06.977 --> 30:08.844
I don't know, put them
in a box and just--

30:08.878 --> 30:11.313
No, that's less offensive.

30:11.347 --> 30:12.748
That's less scary, right?

30:12.782 --> 30:14.583
Like, if your girlfriend's
rummaging through some stuff

30:14.617 --> 30:16.451
and she finds
all this stuff tucked away

30:16.485 --> 30:17.986
like you're hiding it,
then it seems weirder--

30:18.020 --> 30:19.388
Right.

30:19.422 --> 30:20.555
Then if you've got it
out there and you're, like,

30:20.590 --> 30:22.758
"This is me,
this is Jeff, baby.

30:22.792 --> 30:24.359
"I dig torture.

30:24.394 --> 30:25.761
Me and my brother,
we dig torture."

30:25.795 --> 30:28.097
I laid it all out there,
she didn't like my crazy.

30:28.131 --> 30:29.565
- She didn't wanna hear it?
- No.

30:29.599 --> 30:31.968
You could label the box,
"Don't look in this box, honey."

30:32.002 --> 30:33.302
- Right.
- Right?

30:33.336 --> 30:35.204
That wouldn't
have set off any alarms.

30:35.239 --> 30:36.339
[Laughter]

30:36.373 --> 30:38.241
So now she's turned around
on it?

30:38.275 --> 30:40.377
She doesn't mind
the tortured souls anymore?

30:40.411 --> 30:42.378
Or she's out of the picture.

30:42.412 --> 30:43.546
Yeah, she, uh--

30:43.580 --> 30:44.914
- look at the look
on this guy's face.

30:44.948 --> 30:47.083
I'm gonna assume the latter.
[Laughs]

30:47.117 --> 30:48.151
- [Sighs]
- What happened?

30:48.185 --> 30:50.086
Uh, she cheated on me.

30:50.120 --> 30:52.088
- Really?
- Oh, wow.

30:52.122 --> 30:54.324
Yeah, yeah.

30:54.358 --> 30:56.359
Under what circumstances?
How did it happen?

30:56.393 --> 30:58.994
She's a singer,
he's a piano player.

30:59.029 --> 31:01.129
Really?
They told you in song?

31:01.164 --> 31:02.197
No.

31:02.231 --> 31:03.499
She's like, "I gotta tell you

31:03.533 --> 31:05.434
a story about
a pianist, all right?

31:05.468 --> 31:06.902
You're not
gonna wanna hear it."

31:06.936 --> 31:08.537
Please tell me
that you had some awesome,

31:08.571 --> 31:10.739
like, revenge or retribution.

31:10.773 --> 31:13.976
This is it,
this is my revenge.

31:14.010 --> 31:16.979
You're gonna go back and buy
all this stuff in hopes of what?

31:17.013 --> 31:19.014
Getting back
his cojones a little bit.

31:19.049 --> 31:20.015
- Really?
- Right?

31:20.050 --> 31:21.483
It symbolizes
getting your nuts back?

31:21.518 --> 31:22.784
I think so.

31:22.819 --> 31:26.788
Buying this bizarre,
weird, fetish line of toys--

31:26.822 --> 31:28.857
- Yeah.
- You're becoming a man again.

31:28.891 --> 31:30.825
What do they go for?

31:30.860 --> 31:32.628
Uh, right now, I mean,
they're pretty hard to find.

31:32.662 --> 31:34.430
We're selling them
for 75 a piece.

31:34.464 --> 31:35.898
That's a lot of coin.

31:35.933 --> 31:39.002
That's a lot
of torture though as well.

31:39.036 --> 31:41.171
What do you do
for a guy like this?

31:41.206 --> 31:44.341
The merchant in you of course
wants to move these dolls

31:44.376 --> 31:45.709
in a big, bad way.

31:45.744 --> 31:47.545
They're eyesores, to be kind.

31:47.579 --> 31:49.881
The feng shui of the whole store
is ruined by these dolls.

31:49.915 --> 31:52.551
But at the same time,
you also want to help a dude

31:52.585 --> 31:53.919
heal a little bit.

31:53.953 --> 31:55.254
So what do you do
in this situation?

31:55.288 --> 31:59.258
We're offering the,
uh, five figures for 375.

31:59.292 --> 32:00.359
Okay.

32:00.394 --> 32:01.394
But, you know,
since he kind of

32:01.428 --> 32:02.595
touched my heart a little bit,

32:02.629 --> 32:04.063
I did give him a deal.

32:04.097 --> 32:05.164
With a story that sad,
you must hear, like,

32:05.198 --> 32:06.632
that <i>Hulk</i> music, right?

32:06.666 --> 32:07.699
[Laughter]

32:07.734 --> 32:09.034
The sad <i>hulk</i> music.

32:09.068 --> 32:12.571
So what if I did,
like, 150 for all of them?

32:12.605 --> 32:13.638
[Laughs]

32:13.673 --> 32:15.740
Let me offer you
less than half.

32:15.775 --> 32:17.809
Who else is coming,
asking for these gross things?

32:17.843 --> 32:19.377
Come on, man.
I feel bad for you.

32:19.411 --> 32:20.878
Okay.

32:20.913 --> 32:22.446
But not that bad that I'm
gonna go less than half price.

32:22.480 --> 32:24.781
They really weren't sold
in a lot of stores.

32:24.816 --> 32:27.117
I mean, can you see this
on a toy store shelf

32:27.151 --> 32:29.520
where the kids
walk in, you're, like,

32:29.554 --> 32:30.888
"Mommy,
I want an agonistes."

32:30.922 --> 32:34.191
"All the other kids
have them."

32:34.226 --> 32:35.960
250, my friend.

32:35.994 --> 32:37.395
250?

32:37.429 --> 32:40.297
That 250 not only buys

32:40.332 --> 32:43.067
the set of "Tortured Souls" --

32:43.101 --> 32:44.734
- It buys my manhood back?
- Yeah.

32:44.769 --> 32:46.536
- They'll be swinging so low...
- Elephantitis.

32:46.571 --> 32:47.971
Mm-hmm.

32:48.005 --> 32:49.706
They're gonna think
you're disfigured, basically,

32:49.740 --> 32:51.007
is what he's saying.

32:51.041 --> 32:53.409
- 250.
- 250?

32:53.444 --> 32:56.379
Okay, I can do 250.

32:56.413 --> 32:57.614
All right, man.

32:57.648 --> 32:59.482
You got it, 250.

32:59.516 --> 33:01.183
You are all set.

33:01.218 --> 33:05.555
Now this is the beginning.

33:05.589 --> 33:07.357
- Carry them proudly, man.
- With pride, head up.

33:07.391 --> 33:09.192
Let the world know
you're back.

33:09.226 --> 33:10.259
All right.
Thanks again, guys.

33:10.294 --> 33:13.129
All right, man.
Thanks, Jeff.

33:15.333 --> 33:17.467
- What's going on, man?
- Today's the big day.

33:17.502 --> 33:18.969
- Show me, show me.
- Check it out.

33:19.003 --> 33:21.004
- Oh!
- Look at that.

33:21.038 --> 33:22.605
- Awesome.
- Oh, I want that.

33:22.640 --> 33:23.906
All you gotta do
is put a picture up there

33:23.941 --> 33:26.942
and people flock in.

33:34.050 --> 33:35.417
How you doing?

33:35.451 --> 33:37.185
My name's ming, I work
at the secret stash over here.

33:37.220 --> 33:38.286
Oh, hi.

33:38.320 --> 33:39.521
We're running
a huge sale right now.

33:39.555 --> 33:41.589
- Do you like zombies?
- No, but my husband does.

33:41.624 --> 33:43.024
- Oh, that's fantastic.
- Yeah.

33:43.059 --> 33:44.960
- Hey, Walt.
- Yeah.

33:44.994 --> 33:47.763
Ming's got
a hot chick outside.

33:47.798 --> 33:48.865
I don't know about this.

33:48.899 --> 33:50.233
Look how handsome
these devils are.

33:50.267 --> 33:51.601
That one's me by the way.

33:51.636 --> 33:52.936
You know what
that usually means.

33:52.970 --> 33:56.306
No money, no interest--
So who cares?

33:56.341 --> 33:58.342
Show me a fat, ugly dude.

33:58.376 --> 34:00.645
That's where I see dollars.

34:00.679 --> 34:02.714
I think where
he fails to understand is

34:02.748 --> 34:04.149
our demo.

34:04.184 --> 34:06.785
Most people walking
into our store look like us.

34:06.820 --> 34:09.321
They're kind of meek and mousy.

34:09.356 --> 34:11.424
Overweight guys
who tuck their black shirts

34:11.458 --> 34:13.793
into their jeans this tight,
and then their bellies

34:13.827 --> 34:14.793
are hanging out.

34:14.828 --> 34:16.161
Easy, easy.

34:16.196 --> 34:18.397
I'm not feeling good
about myself.

34:18.431 --> 34:22.068
He thinks that, like,
cute girls in their uggs

34:22.101 --> 34:23.703
or in their coach bags
are interested in

34:23.737 --> 34:26.873
shambling, rotting zombies.

34:26.908 --> 34:30.409
And buying superhero
or horror related merchandise.

34:30.445 --> 34:32.847
You gotta go after the dudes.

34:32.880 --> 34:34.181
How you doing?

34:34.216 --> 34:36.083
- Do you like zombies, ma'am?
- No.

34:36.118 --> 34:37.085
No?
Have a good day.

34:37.119 --> 34:38.453
- You like zombies?
- What?

34:38.487 --> 34:40.021
Zombies.
Zombies? Zombies?

34:40.054 --> 34:41.121
- Do you like zombies?
- Pardon me?

34:41.156 --> 34:43.257
- Do you like zombies?
- No!

34:43.292 --> 34:45.726
Ming, we're not appealing
to zombies.

34:45.760 --> 34:48.462
We're selling zombie stuff.
[Sighs]

34:48.496 --> 34:50.398
Hi, how are you doing?
What's your dog's name?

34:50.431 --> 34:52.100
- George.
- How are you doing, George?

34:52.134 --> 34:53.900
Check it out. We're doing
a huge promotion day.

34:53.935 --> 34:56.270
"Day of The Walking Deal."
Do you like zombies?

34:56.304 --> 34:57.571
- No, I don't.
- Whew.

34:57.606 --> 34:58.939
I'm sorry.

34:58.974 --> 35:01.175
Do you want it back?
[Dog barking]

35:01.209 --> 35:04.111
Demographics!
Fat, dorky dudes.

35:04.145 --> 35:05.278
Let me do my thing out here,

35:05.313 --> 35:07.280
you guys make your sales
in there, all right?

35:07.315 --> 35:09.549
There's nobody in there
to sell anything to!

35:09.584 --> 35:12.285
- Money's no object.
- What the hell?

35:12.320 --> 35:14.555
How much you want
for all three of them?

35:14.589 --> 35:16.090
- 12,000.
- Oh, my God.

35:16.124 --> 35:17.758
I can't even tell you--
I feel like I'm gonna be sick.

35:28.139 --> 35:29.606
Hey, guys.

35:29.641 --> 35:31.508
- Rob Bruce!
- How's everybody?

35:31.542 --> 35:33.010
How you doing, man?

35:33.044 --> 35:34.211
You told me that you're
looking for original artwork?

35:34.246 --> 35:35.312
Yeah.

35:35.347 --> 35:36.647
My buddy cliff,
he brought some, uh,

35:36.682 --> 35:40.151
pages from a,
uh, <i>Silver Surfer</i> book.

35:40.185 --> 35:41.452
- What?
- For you to look at, yeah.

35:41.486 --> 35:42.920
<i>Silver Surfer?</i>
Which <i>Silver Surfer?</i>

35:42.955 --> 35:44.589
It's from the hardcover
graphic novel by--

35:44.623 --> 35:45.690
No way!

35:45.724 --> 35:47.959
- Stan Lee and John Buscema.
- Buscema.

35:47.993 --> 35:49.360
- Yup.
- Oh, wow.

35:49.395 --> 35:51.830
- I got three pages.
- No way!

35:57.871 --> 35:59.772
Wow.

35:59.806 --> 36:01.741
The quintessential
<i>Silver Surfer</i> artist,

36:01.776 --> 36:02.943
John Buscema.

36:02.977 --> 36:04.945
I've never seen you
this excited before.

36:04.979 --> 36:07.013
I've been looking
for buscema artwork

36:07.048 --> 36:08.949
of the surfer forever, man.

36:08.983 --> 36:12.118
I've always connected
with John buscema <i>Silver Surfer.</i>

36:12.153 --> 36:16.290
I think if it's not
on par with Kirby Surfer--

36:16.324 --> 36:17.424
Right.

36:17.458 --> 36:18.691
It's barely--
It's insignificant.

36:18.726 --> 36:20.426
- It's a minor difference.
- Yeah.

36:20.460 --> 36:21.994
- It's that powerful.
- Gretzky, Lemieux.

36:22.028 --> 36:24.963
It's so-- It's, like, one chunk
of wonderful or another.

36:24.997 --> 36:28.300
And, um,
I've never seen John Buscema

36:28.334 --> 36:29.968
original art
of the Silver Surfer

36:30.002 --> 36:31.937
come in here
since we've been open.

36:31.971 --> 36:33.605
The entire history
of the stash,

36:33.639 --> 36:34.973
nobody's ever
come in with--

36:35.007 --> 36:37.209
Nobody's ever brought
it in and I've always wanted

36:37.243 --> 36:38.810
a page from that series.

36:38.845 --> 36:40.178
Any page.

36:40.213 --> 36:41.546
Good lord, man.

36:41.581 --> 36:44.382
This is amazing.
Where did you get this?

36:44.417 --> 36:47.118
Well, I got it, uh,
at a comic convention--

36:47.153 --> 36:49.788
Old-time comic convention
back in the late '80s.

36:49.822 --> 36:51.323
That was a long time ago.

36:51.357 --> 36:52.691
Why are these
word balloons so yellow?

36:52.725 --> 36:55.293
They look like they're
almost coming off the page.

36:55.328 --> 36:56.795
Well, that's what
makes these things so classic.

36:56.829 --> 36:58.697
They don't make comics
like this anymore.

36:58.731 --> 37:00.098
They make them in a computer.

37:00.132 --> 37:04.235
They used to ink the page
and then take the word balloons

37:04.270 --> 37:05.737
and then wax them on.

37:05.771 --> 37:07.839
So these are two different
pieces of paper--

37:07.874 --> 37:09.574
Two different kinds of paper.

37:09.609 --> 37:14.246
And now they're separating
and the wax is causing

37:14.280 --> 37:16.949
some kind of chemical reaction,
it's actually changing colors.

37:16.983 --> 37:18.450
So this is true art.

37:18.485 --> 37:20.452
I mean, you don't
see it like this anymore.

37:20.487 --> 37:23.055
Now this is when comics
were comics and men were men.

37:23.089 --> 37:24.156
[Laughter]

37:24.190 --> 37:26.158
Yeah, that's true.

37:26.192 --> 37:27.593
Oh, my God.

37:27.627 --> 37:29.228
I can't even tell you--
I feel like I'm gonna be sick.

37:29.262 --> 37:33.533
There are some things
that a man just lusts for.

37:33.567 --> 37:36.169
Yearns for.
He must have.

37:36.203 --> 37:37.937
- Money's no object.
- What?

37:37.972 --> 37:39.339
I like this.

37:39.373 --> 37:41.174
Who are you and what have
you done with Walt Flanagan?

37:41.208 --> 37:43.610
This is it.
This is my holy grail.

37:43.644 --> 37:45.045
Who are you guys'
holy grails?

37:45.079 --> 37:47.714
I sold the comic book
collection to make <i>Clerks.</i>

37:47.749 --> 37:49.216
And I had a sandman statue.

37:49.250 --> 37:51.485
I would like to find
the sandman statue again.

37:51.520 --> 37:53.520
But not just, like,
you know, they put out

37:53.555 --> 37:54.888
150-200 of them or whatever.

37:54.923 --> 37:56.757
I want the one that was mine.

37:56.792 --> 37:58.326
[Laughter]

37:58.360 --> 37:59.694
You got a holy grail, Ming?

37:59.728 --> 38:01.296
Remember that
jet-firing boba fett

38:01.330 --> 38:02.697
that they pulled?

38:02.732 --> 38:04.666
Yeah, yeah, they made one
and then somebody was like,

38:04.700 --> 38:05.667
"You can't have children
with this,

38:05.702 --> 38:06.702
they'll shoot it
up their nose."

38:06.736 --> 38:07.803
But there were prototypes

38:07.838 --> 38:09.605
that got out
in the wild somehow.

38:09.640 --> 38:10.973
I want one of those.

38:11.007 --> 38:12.208
Zap?

38:12.242 --> 38:15.345
Uh, the cover
to <i>Avengers</i> 151, by Kirby.

38:15.379 --> 38:18.148
I would love that, where cap's
telling everyone to face front.

38:18.182 --> 38:20.184
What about you, sir,
there's gotta be some sort of

38:20.218 --> 38:22.052
geek thing that
even you're after?

38:22.087 --> 38:23.454
Maybe not comic book
oriented, but--

38:23.488 --> 38:24.989
Does a car count?

38:25.024 --> 38:26.457
[Laughter]

38:26.492 --> 38:29.360
How much you want
for all three of them?

38:29.395 --> 38:32.196
I was looking for 12,000
for the set.

38:32.231 --> 38:35.699
Oh, my God.

38:35.734 --> 38:37.501
I gotta have one of them, man.

38:37.535 --> 38:39.435
Well that's the thing,
I was thinking about

38:39.470 --> 38:40.837
selling them as a t.

38:40.871 --> 38:42.272
Okay, so you won't even
entertain buying just one.

38:42.306 --> 38:44.173
Okay, all right.

38:44.207 --> 38:46.342
Would you take, um...

38:46.376 --> 38:47.476
Would you take seven?

38:47.510 --> 38:50.346
- No.
- Unh.

38:50.380 --> 38:52.248
I mean, they only made
one of each of these.

38:52.282 --> 38:53.316
- Right.
- That's it.

38:53.350 --> 38:54.985
And he sat there
and he drew them.

38:55.019 --> 38:56.753
So all right,
so how about eight then?

38:56.788 --> 39:01.893
25... 25 would be 5.
8,000 right here.

39:01.927 --> 39:03.661
We know you didn't
pay 8,000 for these.

39:03.696 --> 39:08.266
That's a-- You're making
a big, big profit off these.

39:08.300 --> 39:10.068
Got to do it
what it's worth today.

39:10.102 --> 39:11.669
It's the only one
in the world.

39:11.703 --> 39:13.270
Um...

39:13.305 --> 39:16.006
How about nine?

39:16.040 --> 39:18.675
9,000...$9,000.

39:19.810 --> 39:22.812
Make it 9,500
and you got a deal.

39:26.950 --> 39:30.352
92.
92. Come on, man.

39:30.387 --> 39:33.022
92.

39:33.056 --> 39:35.424
It's really, really
all I got, man.

39:35.459 --> 39:39.095
Come on, man.

39:39.129 --> 39:40.730
All right, look, look, look,
you seem like you're

39:40.764 --> 39:42.031
gonna give 'em a good home.

39:42.066 --> 39:43.800
I'm gonna.

39:43.834 --> 39:45.735
92.

39:47.705 --> 39:49.239
92-- Oh, you don't wanna
shake this hand.

39:49.273 --> 39:51.240
It's sweaty and nasty.

39:51.275 --> 39:53.509
- Just wipe it off.
- Shake Ming's hand, that'll do.

39:53.544 --> 39:55.344
- You sure?
- Yeah, shake for me.

39:55.379 --> 39:56.679
- I'm making your deal for you.
- Yeah, make the deal for me.

39:56.713 --> 39:57.880
- You're sure?
- Yeah.

39:57.914 --> 39:58.948
All right, 92.

39:58.982 --> 40:00.949
Give the man $9,200.
You shook it.

40:00.984 --> 40:02.784
[Laughter]

40:02.818 --> 40:05.887
Go break open that piggy bank.
[Cash register rings]

40:10.192 --> 40:12.327
Why do I let him fool me?

40:12.361 --> 40:14.295
I don't know, man,
the whole town shuts down

40:14.330 --> 40:15.896
in 20 minutes.

40:15.931 --> 40:17.865
Then what?

40:17.900 --> 40:19.935
I don't wanna
hear the word "zombie" anymore.

40:19.969 --> 40:22.704
I don't know who's worse then,
me for actually believing

40:22.739 --> 40:25.674
anything that comes out
of that idiot's mouth, or him.

40:25.708 --> 40:27.375
For being an idiot?

40:27.410 --> 40:29.912
Run me a bath
and find me a razor.

40:29.946 --> 40:33.783
[Laughs]

40:33.817 --> 40:36.986
- I don't know-- Losing steam.
- [Laughs] Really?

40:37.020 --> 40:38.287
Yeah.

40:38.322 --> 40:39.655
Oh, my God, I can't wait
to report this to Walt.

40:39.690 --> 40:40.823
- No!
- He's defeated.

40:40.857 --> 40:42.224
[Laughs]

40:42.259 --> 40:45.127
The young, spirited man
that you saw this morning,

40:45.162 --> 40:46.529
I think he's broken.

40:46.563 --> 40:51.401
Call him in here and end
this embarrassment, please.

40:51.435 --> 40:53.904
- Time to face the music.
- [Sighs]

40:56.607 --> 40:59.209
Ming.
Ming, Ming, Ming.

40:59.243 --> 41:03.046
Explain to me
what happened here today.

41:03.081 --> 41:04.915
It just wasn't our day.

41:04.949 --> 41:07.083
We would have to beat
the customers off with a stick.

41:07.118 --> 41:09.919
- That's what I was told.
- We had people in here.

41:09.953 --> 41:11.554
It worked.
What was the grand total?

41:11.588 --> 41:16.192
The grand total was $37.88.

41:16.226 --> 41:19.394
Come on, it was $37 you
wouldn't have made otherwise.

41:19.429 --> 41:20.496
Now you're
just being delusional.

41:20.530 --> 41:23.265
Yeah, the flyers
cost more than 37 bucks.

41:23.300 --> 41:24.800
[Laughter]

41:24.834 --> 41:26.201
Even if I fail,
I'll learn something from it.

41:26.236 --> 41:28.237
All right,
let's sum it up right here.

41:28.271 --> 41:29.538
Everybody listen in to this.

41:29.573 --> 41:33.509
Ming's gonna tell
us what he learned today.

41:33.543 --> 41:36.312
I mean, I learned
that I should probably

41:36.346 --> 41:38.047
get another job somewhere else.

41:38.081 --> 41:39.148
That's what I learned.

41:39.182 --> 41:40.382
[Laughter]

41:40.416 --> 41:43.151
Marketing is not all about
how much money you make.

41:43.185 --> 41:45.353
Marketing is getting
the word out.

41:45.387 --> 41:47.121
Maybe they didn't spend money,
but maybe they're gonna

41:47.155 --> 41:48.989
tell their husbands
or their boyfriends or...

41:49.023 --> 41:50.624
Yeah, I'm pretty sure
that marketing is all about

41:50.659 --> 41:52.293
making money.

41:52.327 --> 41:54.262
I think that's
pretty much the definition,

41:54.296 --> 41:56.030
but I could be wrong.

41:56.064 --> 41:57.798
That's for sure.
But I see what you're saying.

41:57.832 --> 41:59.266
You put in some ground work.

41:59.300 --> 42:01.168
Maybe we don't see the sales
right now,

42:01.202 --> 42:06.549
but maybe it translates
to sales six years from now.

42:06.550 --> 42:07.576
[Laughter]

42:07.577 --> 42:09.646
That's what he said.
You miss 100% of the shots

42:09.681 --> 42:12.108
you never take, and Alicia
took the shot.

42:12.109 --> 42:14.347
- I'm taking the shot!
- But your shot broke a window, essentially.

42:14.382 --> 42:17.899
And we didn't really pan out...
But, keep trying,

42:17.900 --> 42:18.953
keep reaching for the stars.

42:18.954 --> 42:21.557
- I'm going to!
- Don't get hostile about it!

42:21.558 --> 42:23.987
You're like, I will Batman!
You'll see!

42:23.988 --> 42:26.667
All right, so that's it.

42:26.668 --> 42:28.676
Let's * it up and go home.

42:28.711 --> 42:30.780
- All right.
- Another day...

42:31.947 --> 42:32.995
And no dollars.

42:36.425 --> 42:38.140
I think that's gonna
wrap it up, man,

42:38.240 --> 42:40.995
for another episode of comic book men.
Thanks for hanging out and listening

42:40.996 --> 42:43.092
- to Kevin Smith.
- Walt Flanagan.

42:43.189 --> 42:44.603
- Bryan Johnson.
- Ming Chen.

42:44.703 --> 42:47.281
- Michael Zapcic.
- Life's in four colors, folks!

42:47.372 --> 42:49.425
Go live it or at least weed it.
Good night.

42:49.426 --> 42:51.000
