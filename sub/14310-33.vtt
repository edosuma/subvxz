Long, long ago,
deep in the forest

00:08.179 --> 00:12.109
there was a hidden village
where tiny creatures lived.

00:12.130 --> 00:15.060
They call themselves Smurfs.

00:15.080 --> 00:17.019
They were good.

00:17.039 --> 00:19.179
[music continues]

00:22.149 --> 00:26.149
Then there was Gargamel,
the evil wizard.

00:26.170 --> 00:28.019
He was bad.

00:28.039 --> 00:31.160
Oh, I hate Smurfs!

00:31.179 --> 00:34.060
I'll get you,
I'll get all of you

00:34.079 --> 00:36.140

I ever do!

Oh, I'll get you!

00:41.159 --> 00:45.000
I'll find your village someday!
You'll be sorry!

00:45.020 --> 00:47.070
Well, the forest is still there

00:47.090 --> 00:51.140
and if you listen,
you may hear Gargamel's rage.

00:51.159 --> 00:52.200
And if you are good

00:52.219 --> 00:55.179
you may just catch a glimpse

00:55.200 --> 00:57.100
of the Smurfs.

Oh, Papa Smurf, the drought
has dried everything up.

01:24.210 --> 01:28.189
Aw, there's not a single thing
to eat in the whole forest.

01:28.210 --> 01:31.170
Well, Vanity and Clumsy
are still looking.

01:31.189 --> 01:35.000
Maybe they'll have some luck,
I hope.

01:35.020 --> 01:39.079
Uh, gosh, Vanity,
if we don't find some food fast

01:39.099 --> 01:41.099
all the Smurfs will starve.

01:41.120 --> 01:43.009
Well, one thing about starving

01:43.030 --> 01:46.060
it does highlight

what are we going to do?

for somethin' to eat, I guess.

but that doesn't mean
he's not around.

11:20.029 --> 11:22.110
So use caution,
my little Smurfs.

11:22.129 --> 11:25.149
[instrumental music]

11:27.090 --> 11:29.139
I hate dark logs.

11:29.159 --> 11:31.139
- 'Oh, my goodness.'
- Whoa!

11:31.159 --> 11:35.129
Now, miserable Smurfs,
I not only have all your food

11:35.149 --> 11:38.049
but your little blue hides
as well.

11:38.070 --> 11:40.120
Hey, get off my back, Clumsy.

11:40.139 --> 11:43.029
Gargamel,
you're making a big mistake.

11:43.049 --> 11:46.070
That diamond
doesn't tolerate selfishness.

11:46.090 --> 11:48.000
[chuckles]

11:48.019 --> 11:50.019
I'm no fool, Papa Smurf.

11:50.039 --> 11:53.120
You just want it for yourself,
but it's mine now!

11:53.139 --> 11:56.039
And so are you!

11:56.059 --> 11:58.070
[stammering]
W-what's this?

11:58.090 --> 12:01.120
W-w-what's h-happening?

12:01.139 --> 12:04.070
[whimpering]

12:04.090 --> 12:07.049
Your greed is your undoing.

12:07.070 --> 12:11.210
[stammering]
I-I-I'm f-f-freezing!

12:11.230 --> 12:14.149
- Let's smurf out of here!
- Gangway.

12:14.169 --> 12:17.070
P-P-Papa Smurf, uh

12:17.090 --> 12:21.029
p-p-please break the s-s-spell!

12:21.049 --> 12:25.070
That is impossible.
But not to worry, Gargamel.

12:25.090 --> 12:26.230
When the sun strikes the diamond

12:27.009 --> 12:29.190
everything will return
to normal.

12:29.210 --> 12:31.210
[thunder rumbling]

12:31.230 --> 12:35.159
(Papa Smurf)
'Hm. Ha-ha-ha.
Looks like rain.'

12:35.179 --> 12:38.070
[shuddering]
R-r-rain.

12:38.090 --> 12:41.090
[shuddering]
R-r-rain!

12:41.110 --> 12:43.220
Rain! The drought's over!

12:44.000 --> 12:45.220
[all cheering]
Hooray!

12:46.000 --> 12:50.100
Gee, Papa Smurf. It may be days
before the sun comes out again.

12:50.120 --> 12:54.149
(Papa Smurf)
'Yes. Isn't it smurfy?'

12:54.169 --> 12:56.049
[Gargamel shuddering]

12:58.179 --> 13:01.070
[theme music]

13:24.100 --> 13:27.110
[instrumental music]

13:28.190 --> 13:31.090
[instrumental music]
