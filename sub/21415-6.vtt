01:35.229 --> 01:37.665
-(applause)
-* Is this Christmas... *

01:37.731 --> 01:39.867
BRADY:
Great work, everyone.

01:39.933 --> 01:43.837
* And this Christmas *

01:43.904 --> 01:45.839
* Is here. *

01:48.842 --> 01:51.445
BRADY (voice-over):
Looks like we got a hit!

01:51.512 --> 01:54.615
Sell enough tickets
to choke the MGM lion.

01:54.682 --> 01:55.883
Ho, ho, ho.

01:55.949 --> 01:57.918
What would you like
for Christmas, little girl?

01:57.985 --> 02:00.554
You are my Christmas present.

02:00.621 --> 02:01.389
(laughs)

02:01.455 --> 02:02.890
When are you gonna unwrap me?

02:02.956 --> 02:04.492
Wasn't that the sweetest story
you ever saw?

02:04.558 --> 02:06.059
No more candy canes,
you had two already.

02:06.126 --> 02:07.895
I'll get you some popcorn,
come on.

02:07.961 --> 02:09.163
HACKETT:
Hey, boss.

02:09.229 --> 02:10.764
Here's to Christmas miracles.

02:10.830 --> 02:12.466
Yeah. Merry Christmas.

02:12.533 --> 02:15.002
-That whole confession bit.
-Uh-uh.

02:15.068 --> 02:16.804
-Was that...?
-Stahr's idea.

02:16.870 --> 02:19.707
-But Kay's words. -Now, now,
we'll have none of that here.

02:19.773 --> 02:23.811
To Monroe Stahr, who,
in a mad reign of terror,

02:23.877 --> 02:25.946
fired his editor, producer,
director and--

02:26.013 --> 02:28.582
God forgive us-- his writer,

02:28.649 --> 02:30.984
not to mention his boozehound
leading man,

02:31.051 --> 02:34.588
the scenery-chewing,
ingÃƒÂ©nue-screwing Mr. Frost,

02:34.655 --> 02:37.391
and turned tragedy to a triumph.

02:37.458 --> 02:39.593
-Hear, hear. -Cheers.
-Hear, hear.

02:39.660 --> 02:41.262
It was Pat's baby,
start to finish.

02:41.329 --> 02:44.131
What do you think of it, Hannah?

02:44.198 --> 02:46.600
Um...

02:46.667 --> 02:48.369
I don't know.

02:48.436 --> 02:51.104
It is my first
American Christmas.

02:51.171 --> 02:52.440
Is that really
what they are like?

02:52.506 --> 02:54.442
-Yes. -STAHR: More or less.
-Yes, yes, yes.

02:54.508 --> 02:55.709
Perfectly accurate.

02:55.776 --> 02:57.945
How'd they like it?

02:58.011 --> 02:59.647
I don't think Nathan's
ever gonna be the same.

02:59.713 --> 03:01.482
I mean, not too long ago,
movie theaters

03:01.549 --> 03:04.485
were something we looked for
to get out of the rain.

03:04.552 --> 03:06.153
I'm letting them see it
again this afternoon,

03:06.220 --> 03:07.755
just the two of them,
at the Egyptian.

03:07.821 --> 03:09.990
It's what they wanted
for Christmas.

03:10.057 --> 03:11.459
Hear that, Daddy?

03:11.525 --> 03:14.295
-Paying customers.
-(grunts)

03:14.362 --> 03:16.897
(quietly):
Excuse me.

03:16.964 --> 03:19.600
Well, if it isn't the Jew
who invented Christmas.

03:19.667 --> 03:21.735
I think another Jew gets credit
for that one.

03:21.802 --> 03:23.471
BRADY:
Tell that to your disciples.

03:23.537 --> 03:24.905
STAHR: Be happy, Pat.
Your movie works.

03:24.972 --> 03:27.308
BRADY: They're my employees,
they have to like it.

03:27.375 --> 03:28.442
STAHR:
But I don't.

03:28.509 --> 03:30.444
And I'm telling you, it's a hit.

03:30.511 --> 03:32.946
Excuse me.
Hate to interrupt. Um...

03:33.013 --> 03:35.716
We should really go, if we're
gonna get there before dark.

03:35.783 --> 03:37.551
Swell.
You grab all the applause,

03:37.618 --> 03:39.253
I got to worry
about the box office.

03:39.320 --> 03:40.988
They have got phones in Big
Bear, Pat. I'll be checking in.

03:41.054 --> 03:43.223
But will you be dying inside,
sweating out every call

03:43.291 --> 03:45.393
-from distribution?
-Dying, dying.

03:45.459 --> 03:47.961
Aching, I promise.

03:51.399 --> 03:54.234
The hell's he doing here?

03:55.503 --> 03:57.438
STAHR:
Shall I call security, Vajna?

03:57.505 --> 03:58.872
Take it easy, Monroe.

03:58.939 --> 04:00.974
It's bad luck
to treat old friends like that.

04:01.041 --> 04:02.242
STAHR:
Old friends.

04:02.310 --> 04:03.444
And you got a hit on your hands.

04:03.511 --> 04:05.646
Say, I hear, uh,
you got an unknown

04:05.713 --> 04:07.281
starring in your next picture.

04:07.348 --> 04:09.249
She seeking representation?

04:09.317 --> 04:10.584
(scoffs)

04:10.651 --> 04:12.820
I'd sooner put her with Hitler.

04:12.886 --> 04:14.388
You must know that.

04:14.455 --> 04:16.290
That's what I don't get
about you, Stahr.

04:16.357 --> 04:19.392
You can turn even a simple chat
into high drama.

04:19.459 --> 04:21.028
That what this is?

04:21.094 --> 04:22.463
A simple chat?

04:22.530 --> 04:25.466
How about you get off my lot?

04:25.533 --> 04:27.668
I was just leaving.

04:29.202 --> 04:31.104
(talking quietly)

04:31.171 --> 04:32.806
-We'll see you next week.
-KAY: Have a wonderful time.

04:32.873 --> 04:34.408
-Have a great weekend.
-HACKETT: Have fun.

04:34.475 --> 04:36.009
-Bye-bye.
-STAHR: Congratulations.

04:43.083 --> 04:44.184
(sighs)

04:44.251 --> 04:45.753
What about Otis?

04:45.819 --> 04:47.054
For our snowman.

04:47.120 --> 04:48.255
Otis?

04:48.322 --> 04:50.190
Get him a fine cashmere scarf,

04:50.257 --> 04:51.559
a calabash pipe,

04:51.625 --> 04:54.928
make him a real gentleman.

04:54.995 --> 04:57.598
Well-read, charming,

04:57.665 --> 05:00.634
a wise observer of humanity.

05:00.701 --> 05:03.203
Oh, and a whiskey drinker.

05:03.270 --> 05:04.372
Mm.

05:04.438 --> 05:06.540
Should I be jealous?

05:06.607 --> 05:09.109
Oh, it depends
if you got me a present.

05:09.176 --> 05:10.411
I can't tell you.

05:10.478 --> 05:12.446
-Not till tomorrow.
-Really?

05:12.513 --> 05:14.715
LANG:
Mr. Stahr.

05:14.782 --> 05:15.616
My compliments.

05:15.683 --> 05:17.651
That was quite something.

05:17.718 --> 05:20.854
I have never seen a film
dipped in sugar before.

05:20.921 --> 05:23.357
Glad I cut the dancing
gingerbread number,

05:23.424 --> 05:25.192
-you would've hated that.
-Hmm.

05:25.258 --> 05:27.595
Is this the kind of movie
you expect me to make,

05:27.661 --> 05:28.829
a picture book for children?

05:28.896 --> 05:31.399
You make the film you want,
Fritz.

05:31.465 --> 05:32.633
That's why I hired you.

05:32.700 --> 05:34.902
Yes, but how
should I make anything

05:34.968 --> 05:37.371
with an actress
who refuses to rehearse?

05:39.239 --> 05:40.340
Mr. Lang...

05:40.408 --> 05:42.009
Six weeks.

05:42.075 --> 05:44.077
Six weeks to prepare.

05:44.144 --> 05:45.979
And this one refuses me.

05:46.046 --> 05:48.482
-I don't understand.
-LANG: You didn't tell him?

05:48.549 --> 05:52.019
He wanted to rehearse
this weekend.

05:52.085 --> 05:55.155
LANG: 24 hours
of uninterrupted rehearsals.

05:55.222 --> 05:58.559
An acquaintance lent me
his home for the purpose.

05:58.626 --> 06:02.029
Axel here left his family
in the middle of a trip.

06:02.095 --> 06:03.964
But my leading actress,

06:04.031 --> 06:08.469
who has uttered a total
of zero words on film, declined.

06:08.536 --> 06:10.438
(exhales)

06:10.504 --> 06:11.905
You and I had plans.

06:11.972 --> 06:13.907
We were looking forward
to going.

06:13.974 --> 06:17.277
Due to the insane schedule
you have put me on, Monroe,

06:17.344 --> 06:19.447
this is the only time
I will have free

06:19.513 --> 06:21.782
between now and the day we wrap.

06:21.849 --> 06:23.517
I thought, perhaps,
Miss Garbo here

06:23.584 --> 06:25.719
might make an accommodation.

06:25.786 --> 06:28.021
(scoffs)

06:29.890 --> 06:31.559
Monroe.

06:31.625 --> 06:32.993
I'm sorry, darling.

06:33.060 --> 06:34.528
He's the director.

06:34.595 --> 06:36.897
LANG:
At last, an adult decides.

06:36.964 --> 06:39.567
Thank you, Mr. Stahr.
Please, Axel, take her luggage.

06:39.633 --> 06:40.768
(clears throat)

06:40.834 --> 06:44.337
(quietly):
Is it, uh...

06:44.404 --> 06:46.073
Just, uh...

06:46.139 --> 06:47.608
Uh.

06:48.842 --> 06:49.943
(exhales)

06:50.010 --> 06:51.712
(door closes)

06:57.317 --> 06:58.819
How could you do this?

06:58.886 --> 07:00.353
There'll be other weekends.

07:00.420 --> 07:01.755
It's Christmas Eve.

07:01.822 --> 07:04.191
It's a chance
to make the movie better

07:04.257 --> 07:06.760
and rehearse with one of
the world's greatest directors.

07:06.827 --> 07:08.929
You have to, for your career.

07:08.996 --> 07:10.864
My career.

07:10.931 --> 07:12.399
Exactly.

07:12.466 --> 07:14.401
You had no right
to speak for me.

07:14.468 --> 07:16.737
I was speaking for the picture.

07:16.804 --> 07:18.706
Good to know your priorities.

07:18.772 --> 07:20.874
Kathleen, that is not fair.

07:20.941 --> 07:23.243
This is important, you and I.

07:23.310 --> 07:26.279
I mean, if...
if we don't matter to you...

07:26.346 --> 07:29.149
At Christmas, in my family,

07:29.216 --> 07:32.085
-we would never...
-What, do your job?

07:35.823 --> 07:39.827
We would never be away
from the people we love.

07:48.135 --> 07:49.603
Your gift.

07:55.275 --> 07:57.745
Kathleen.

08:01.682 --> 08:03.116
BRADY (voice-over):
Eh, forget Rochester.

08:03.183 --> 08:05.352
That town's a toilet bowl.
What about Stamford?

08:05.418 --> 08:08.221
Must be gangbusters in Stamford.

08:08.288 --> 08:11.458
Goddamn matinees.

08:11.525 --> 08:13.160
Call me with an update later.

08:13.226 --> 08:14.494
Yeah.

08:14.562 --> 08:16.664
Merry Christmas to you, too.

08:16.730 --> 08:18.498
(slams phone)

08:20.300 --> 08:22.502
(groans)

08:22.570 --> 08:24.705
Nobody's coming out.

08:24.772 --> 08:27.507
Not even the hayseeds.

08:27.575 --> 08:29.743
I don't understand it.

08:29.810 --> 08:32.412
We spent a fortune
marketing this thing.

08:32.479 --> 08:34.715
Can I get you anything,
Mr. Brady?

08:34.782 --> 08:36.216
Ads in all the major newspapers.

08:36.283 --> 08:38.251
Billboards, posters,
you can't even take a piss

08:38.318 --> 08:41.554
without Leslie Reeves
grinning back at you.

08:41.621 --> 08:45.092
It's just the first matinee,
sir.

08:45.158 --> 08:46.660
It'll pick up.

08:48.028 --> 08:50.463
My sister in Evanston's
taking her family tonight.

08:50.530 --> 08:51.565
How many kids she got?

08:51.632 --> 08:53.767
Just my niece.

08:53.834 --> 08:55.603
You couldn't
have been Catholic, Birdy?

08:55.669 --> 08:57.938
(laughs softly)

08:59.907 --> 09:04.912
Go home and be with your family,
Mr. Brady.

09:04.978 --> 09:06.313
Yeah.

09:06.379 --> 09:08.682
You, too.

09:12.853 --> 09:15.122
Could I have some water?

09:15.188 --> 09:19.192
No, sweetie, I'm sorry,
you can't.

09:21.094 --> 09:23.496
The doctor was in
a little bit ago,

09:23.563 --> 09:25.899
and I don't want you to worry,

09:25.966 --> 09:28.869
they need to operate.

09:28.936 --> 09:30.904
They think there might be
a bleed in there.

09:30.971 --> 09:34.374
So they are gonna go in
and fix it right up.

09:34.441 --> 09:36.576
(exhales)

09:44.117 --> 09:46.153
Mr. Brady?

09:46.219 --> 09:48.555
Yes, Miner. What is it?

09:48.622 --> 09:50.858
(laughs softly)

09:50.924 --> 09:54.061
Mr. Stahr wants a revised budget
on his desk by Monday,

09:54.127 --> 09:57.597
so it's holiday
be damned for me.

09:57.665 --> 09:59.166
Okay.

09:59.232 --> 10:02.736
Well, I'm sorry to interrupt,
ma'am.

10:02.803 --> 10:05.238
Whatcha got there?

10:05.305 --> 10:08.108
Just, uh... some goodies.

10:08.175 --> 10:10.010
Hmm.

10:12.112 --> 10:13.246
Want some?

10:13.313 --> 10:16.684
I better not,
I'm still on the clock.

10:16.750 --> 10:19.086
Why don't you--

10:19.152 --> 10:21.388
if Nathan and Darla
are off at the movies--

10:21.454 --> 10:23.323
come over for dinner?

10:23.390 --> 10:25.358
Come, come over.

10:25.425 --> 10:27.294
To the mansion.

10:27.360 --> 10:29.062
You had me over last time.

10:29.129 --> 10:31.999
Well, that's not the same thing
as the Okie coming over

10:32.065 --> 10:34.634
to Mr. Brady's on Christmas Eve.

10:36.536 --> 10:38.205
Maybe...

10:38.271 --> 10:41.909
maybe, if, if I didn't have
just this one suit.

10:41.975 --> 10:44.244
It's hardly Buckingham Palace,
Max.

10:45.979 --> 10:47.915
Let me tell you how it would go.

10:47.981 --> 10:49.516
I'd meet you at the door.

10:49.582 --> 10:51.018
No butler?

10:51.084 --> 10:52.152
Night off.

10:52.219 --> 10:54.187
I'd have a hot cider
waiting for you.

10:54.254 --> 10:56.990
And then we'd go into the parlor
for some tree trimming.

10:57.057 --> 10:59.592
(exhales)
Me and the boss.

10:59.659 --> 11:02.495
No. Daddy would be on the phone.

11:02.562 --> 11:04.364
He's always on the phone.

11:04.431 --> 11:07.367
But my mother will love you.

11:07.434 --> 11:10.003
She already thinks
you're very charming.

11:11.071 --> 11:12.806
Those Brady women are clever.

11:12.873 --> 11:16.810
We'd have a drink on the patio.

11:16.877 --> 11:19.179
It's cold out.

11:19.246 --> 11:22.415
Could put my jacket
over your shoulders.

11:22.482 --> 11:23.683
Winning more points with mother.

11:23.751 --> 11:25.118
Good.

11:25.185 --> 11:28.822
We'd look up at the stars...

11:31.691 --> 11:32.525
(popcorn drops)

11:32.592 --> 11:34.294
-Max, I wasn't...
-I'm sorry, was that bad?

11:34.361 --> 11:36.496
Well, I-I thought
we were pretending.

11:36.563 --> 11:38.398
-I don't know, were we?
I'm sorry. -I don't know.

11:38.465 --> 11:40.433
-I'm sorry, here you go.
-Wait, but I didn't...

11:40.500 --> 11:42.803
-mean to... -I-I don't know,
you were coming towards me, I...

11:42.870 --> 11:45.472
I-I'm sorry.
And I mess up.

12:06.827 --> 12:09.662
AXEL:
Now, whose house is this, Fritz?

12:09.729 --> 12:11.899
A nothing manager
trying to sign me.

12:11.965 --> 12:13.934
(speaks in German)

12:14.001 --> 12:16.870
I needed the space,
so I am allowing him to believe

12:16.937 --> 12:18.638
I take him seriously.

12:18.705 --> 12:21.174
Don't eat the props, Axel.

12:24.677 --> 12:26.613
(knocking on door)

12:26.679 --> 12:28.481
(door creaks open)

12:28.548 --> 12:30.818
Clint.

12:30.884 --> 12:33.386
Merry Christmas, Monroe.

12:33.453 --> 12:36.023
Uh...
(chuckles)

12:36.089 --> 12:37.991
Wasn't expecting you.

12:38.058 --> 12:40.227
You saved it, pal.

12:40.293 --> 12:44.031
"Angels on the Avenue,"
it's... it's wonderful.

12:44.097 --> 12:45.432
Leslie was wonderful.

12:45.498 --> 12:49.636
This is the Christmas
America dreams about.

12:49.702 --> 12:54.574
I just wanted to say
congratulations, and thank you.

12:54.641 --> 12:56.409
Uh...

12:56.476 --> 12:58.311
You'll have to forgive me,
Clint.

12:58.378 --> 13:01.915
People don't often respond
to being fired so graciously.

13:01.982 --> 13:05.618
No, well, I wasn't gracious
that first week.

13:05.685 --> 13:09.789
I drank up just about everything
but the L.A. River.

13:09.857 --> 13:11.959
But then I ran
into Burt Ainsley.

13:12.025 --> 13:13.326
Remember him?

13:13.393 --> 13:16.463
Yeah, sure.
From the silent days.

13:20.633 --> 13:23.103
Please. Have a seat.

13:23.170 --> 13:25.973
Well, he took me in,

13:26.039 --> 13:29.142
dried me out, showed me
what I was doing to myself.

13:29.209 --> 13:31.411
Even found me an acting coach.

13:31.478 --> 13:33.513
So, thank you.

13:33.580 --> 13:35.715
You saved me.

13:35.782 --> 13:37.217
I'm happy to hear that.

13:37.284 --> 13:39.452
Well, Burt's having a party
tonight.

13:39.519 --> 13:41.354
Real holiday shindig.

13:41.421 --> 13:42.822
You should come.

13:42.890 --> 13:44.024
Ah, I don't know.

13:44.091 --> 13:45.959
Uh, there's so much
to catch up on.

13:46.026 --> 13:48.428
Come on, it's Christmas.

14:01.909 --> 14:03.243
See you tonight.

14:07.547 --> 14:08.916
Oh, and, uh...

14:08.982 --> 14:11.151
bring that pretty girl of yours.

14:11.218 --> 14:13.353
(door opens, then closes)

14:21.794 --> 14:24.697
So, let me understand,

14:24.764 --> 14:26.900
you can't have dinner,

14:26.967 --> 14:29.169
you can't have a drink,

14:29.236 --> 14:33.873
you can't go for a walk
because you have an appointment.

14:33.941 --> 14:36.576
-On Christmas Eve.
-Yeah.

14:36.643 --> 14:37.877
I know it sounds...

14:37.945 --> 14:39.612
Curious?

14:43.350 --> 14:44.484
(sighs)

14:44.551 --> 14:46.119
It's stupid, it's, um...

14:46.186 --> 14:47.988
it's Mass,
it's Christmas Eve Mass.

14:48.055 --> 14:50.157
-I only go once a year and...
-(gasps)

14:50.223 --> 14:53.026
That is disgraceful.

14:53.093 --> 14:54.794
At home,
we call that a "shonde."

14:54.861 --> 14:56.129
Shameful.

14:56.196 --> 14:58.131
What, do you take Communion?

14:58.198 --> 15:01.534
You light a prayer candle?

15:01.601 --> 15:03.971
No.

15:04.037 --> 15:05.939
It's worse than that.

15:11.611 --> 15:13.046
I sing in the choir.

15:13.113 --> 15:15.048
-You do?
-Baritone.

15:17.150 --> 15:20.353
I love Christmas Eve Mass.

15:20.420 --> 15:21.554
I want to come.

15:21.621 --> 15:23.690
-No.
-Please.

15:23.756 --> 15:25.658
No, I'm not a performer, I...

15:25.725 --> 15:27.127
I'm not really even a singer.

15:28.728 --> 15:30.998
Please.

15:33.033 --> 15:34.601
All right.

15:34.667 --> 15:37.304
On one condition:

15:37.370 --> 15:42.875
you tell no one what you saw.

15:42.942 --> 15:44.377
Do you swear?

15:45.645 --> 15:47.047
So help me God.

15:47.114 --> 15:49.182
(organ music, children laughing)

15:49.249 --> 15:51.051
PRIEST:
Bobby, Tommy, no running, boys.

15:51.118 --> 15:53.286
-BOY: Yes, Father.
-That's it.

15:56.089 --> 15:57.424
(Brady moans)

15:59.659 --> 16:01.128
(moans loudly)

16:04.931 --> 16:07.067
May I help you, my son?

16:07.134 --> 16:08.668
You seem in distress.

16:08.735 --> 16:10.837
Sorry, Father, I...

16:10.903 --> 16:12.239
I...

16:15.108 --> 16:17.544
Perhaps we can sit in silence.

16:19.012 --> 16:20.347
No, no, I...

16:20.413 --> 16:23.750
I brought a baby into the world.

16:23.816 --> 16:27.487
Beautiful baby.

16:27.554 --> 16:29.789
Was it great.

16:29.856 --> 16:31.624
Pride, joy...

16:32.859 --> 16:35.095
...anticipation.

16:35.162 --> 16:37.264
So full of promise.

16:37.330 --> 16:41.000
But, Father,
my baby has taken a turn.

16:41.068 --> 16:46.005
My baby is... in crisis.

16:46.073 --> 16:47.507
And I'm scared.

16:47.574 --> 16:49.276
Hmm.

16:49.342 --> 16:51.411
Stuck, waiting for news.

16:51.478 --> 16:53.146
It might not survive
the weekend.

16:54.447 --> 16:56.383
(sighs)

16:58.418 --> 17:01.788
I am so sorry
for your suffering, my son.

17:01.854 --> 17:03.190
Can I help?

17:04.257 --> 17:05.458
I do need your help, Father.

17:05.525 --> 17:06.925
From your whole congregation.

17:06.992 --> 17:09.662
Well, we will pray
for the little one, of course.

17:09.729 --> 17:11.030
Prayer may not be enough.

17:11.098 --> 17:13.700
Prayer is always enough.

17:20.207 --> 17:22.942
That... is a multitude
of tickets

17:23.009 --> 17:25.212
to the new Brady-American
picture,

17:25.278 --> 17:28.248
"Angels on the Avenue."

17:28.315 --> 17:30.717
I need you to distribute them.

17:33.720 --> 17:35.188
Tickets?

17:35.255 --> 17:39.025
One per family.

17:39.092 --> 17:41.294
If you would.

17:41.361 --> 17:44.831
Do you believe in confession?

17:44.897 --> 17:47.267
Well, I'm not Catholic.

17:47.334 --> 17:51.037
I almost gave it a try once
on a trip to Italy.

17:51.104 --> 17:53.340
But the impulse passed.

17:53.406 --> 17:57.277
I need to say something.

17:58.511 --> 18:00.880
I wouldn't want
to take this with me.

18:00.947 --> 18:03.316
All right.

18:03.383 --> 18:06.853
I haven't been completely
honest with you,

18:06.919 --> 18:08.988
or anybody here.

18:09.055 --> 18:10.457
Okay.

18:13.360 --> 18:17.830
That theater I passed out in,

18:17.897 --> 18:21.134
I wasn't just there
to watch a picture.

18:23.236 --> 18:25.238
I don't understand.

18:26.306 --> 18:28.475
I bring men there.

18:28.541 --> 18:31.444
-Customers.
-Oh.

18:31.511 --> 18:32.679
I see.

18:32.745 --> 18:35.282
Everything else I told you
was true, I-I swear it.

18:35.348 --> 18:39.419
I just... thought
that they'd kick me out

18:39.486 --> 18:41.721
if they knew that part.

18:43.623 --> 18:47.660
And I thought you wouldn't
come see me anymore.

18:47.727 --> 18:49.296
If you want to leave,
I understand.

18:49.362 --> 18:51.231
Nobody needs to spend
Christmas Eve...

18:51.298 --> 18:55.101
I had an affair
with my husband's partner.

18:55.168 --> 18:58.271
Milton, that's his name.

19:01.441 --> 19:05.778
Handsome as the devil.

19:05.845 --> 19:08.815
It went on for two years.

19:08.881 --> 19:10.583
Two years.

19:10.650 --> 19:12.952
Yeah.

19:13.019 --> 19:16.589
I thought about it every second.

19:19.392 --> 19:23.230
So it just kept happening.

19:23.296 --> 19:25.732
He had one rule,

19:25.798 --> 19:29.001
and that was no contact
of any kind.

19:29.068 --> 19:31.304
You know, no secret notes.

19:31.371 --> 19:33.273
Of course, no phone calls.

19:34.173 --> 19:36.576
So you know how we communicated?

19:36.643 --> 19:38.278
Hmm.

19:38.345 --> 19:40.280
My husband is color-blind.

19:40.347 --> 19:44.351
I pick out his clothes for him
every day,

19:44.417 --> 19:47.454
and when I put him

19:47.520 --> 19:52.959
in this one bright red tie...

19:55.328 --> 19:59.065
...that's my signal to Milton

19:59.131 --> 20:02.435
that I'm coming over.

20:03.503 --> 20:06.606
I wasn't just cheating
on my husband...

20:08.875 --> 20:11.844
...I was making him
the messenger.

20:11.911 --> 20:13.546
(exhales)

20:16.683 --> 20:22.455
It could've destroyed
their... business,

20:22.522 --> 20:25.325
their friendship.

20:25.392 --> 20:28.261
My family.

20:28.328 --> 20:31.898
And I didn't care.

20:34.033 --> 20:36.736
It was mine.

20:38.838 --> 20:41.608
And I would do it again.

20:41.674 --> 20:45.412
Do you think that anything
you did in that theater

20:45.478 --> 20:49.282
was worse than that?

20:52.151 --> 20:54.621
It's Christmas.

21:00.192 --> 21:04.063
What do you say...

21:04.130 --> 21:06.699
we forgive ourselves?

21:15.875 --> 21:18.110
CELIA:
Mother?

21:18.177 --> 21:21.348
-Remember these?
-Mm.

21:21.414 --> 21:24.317
Do you have
a New Year's resolution?

21:24.384 --> 21:25.985
A week early for that,
isn't it?

21:26.052 --> 21:27.520
Hmm.

21:27.587 --> 21:28.921
Well, it's a big decision,

21:28.988 --> 21:31.591
to dedicate a year of your life
to something.

21:31.658 --> 21:33.793
I just wondered
if you had one yet.

21:37.697 --> 21:42.068
Oh, no, we have to use those.

21:42.134 --> 21:45.372
These were your favorite
when you were little.

21:45.438 --> 21:48.808
You used to call them
your "wee woodens."

21:48.875 --> 21:52.011
And you would make up stories
and act them out,

21:52.078 --> 21:54.814
and tell Daddy and me
not to listen.

21:54.881 --> 21:58.317
But we always did,
because they were so good.

21:58.385 --> 22:01.788
Oh, the romances.

22:01.854 --> 22:03.490
The heartbreaks.

22:06.893 --> 22:11.731
You had such an imagination
for a little girl.

22:11.798 --> 22:15.067
We're only doing silver and gold
this year.

22:22.008 --> 22:26.278
You know,
I do have a resolution.

22:26.345 --> 22:30.316
I think this is the year I stop
thinking about Monroe Stahr.

22:30.383 --> 22:33.686
-How about you?
-(door opens)

22:33.753 --> 22:36.155
I...

22:36.222 --> 22:39.792
-(door closes)
-think that's a wonderful plan.

22:42.995 --> 22:44.664
What do you think?

22:44.731 --> 22:47.700
I think I have a beautiful wife,

22:47.767 --> 22:50.903
and a beautiful daughter,

22:50.970 --> 22:54.974
and if I had a brain in my head,
I'd never leave this room,

22:55.041 --> 22:57.109
ever again.

22:57.176 --> 23:00.813
Tree's nice, too.

23:04.050 --> 23:06.953
("Silent Night" playing)

23:27.306 --> 23:29.442
* *

23:51.864 --> 23:54.166
AXEL (voice-over):
In this city of strangers,

23:54.233 --> 23:56.569
it's nice to take the time
to meet your neighbors.

23:56.636 --> 23:58.404
Don't you think?

23:58.471 --> 24:02.074
We should've done this ages ago.

24:02.141 --> 24:04.644
LANG:
Stop.

24:09.248 --> 24:13.886
You believe this man
to be a fascist spy. Ja?

24:16.022 --> 24:18.591
And here you are, alone,
in his living room,

24:18.658 --> 24:21.494
vulnerable, terrified.

24:21.561 --> 24:23.930
That's a wonderful note, Fritz.

24:29.135 --> 24:32.104
This funny, Kathleen?

24:34.173 --> 24:36.342
Begin again.

24:36.408 --> 24:39.011
(clears throat)

24:42.248 --> 24:44.383
We should've done this ages ago.

24:44.450 --> 24:47.253
No, no, no. God's sakes.

24:47.319 --> 24:51.223
That was the most
dishonest performance

24:51.290 --> 24:52.959
I have ever seen.

24:54.026 --> 24:57.096
Even the way you eat is a lie.

24:58.497 --> 25:01.233
Do it again! Eat.

25:07.106 --> 25:11.077
No, Kathleen,
I did not believe you.

25:11.143 --> 25:12.679
Excuse me.

25:19.185 --> 25:21.253
Again.

25:25.658 --> 25:26.859
Again.

25:26.926 --> 25:28.828
-Fritz, I...
-Again.

25:28.895 --> 25:30.897
Again.

25:34.133 --> 25:37.737
No wonder you were afraid
to rehearse.

25:39.005 --> 25:40.306
Again.

25:40.372 --> 25:42.575
Again, again, again!

25:44.744 --> 25:47.546
Is it so difficult?

25:48.615 --> 25:50.817
You take one peanut...

25:50.883 --> 25:54.286
and you put it in your mouth
and you chew.

25:54.353 --> 25:55.988
And then you take another peanut

25:56.055 --> 25:58.290
and you put it in your mouth
and you chew

25:58.357 --> 25:59.859
-like a human being.
-Fritz, please, I...

25:59.926 --> 26:01.861
And then, when the camera
comes to you,

26:01.928 --> 26:04.163
people know that
you are a human being

26:04.230 --> 26:07.066
and not an acting monkey,
and you eat again,

26:07.133 --> 26:08.567
-and you eat slowly...
-Fritz, please...

26:08.635 --> 26:11.270
No, you will commit to the scene

26:11.337 --> 26:12.705
and to the character!

26:12.772 --> 26:14.607
More like an actual actress

26:14.674 --> 26:16.776
and less like
someone's girlfriend

26:16.843 --> 26:19.311
who was hired on a whim!

26:21.580 --> 26:24.150
(peanuts clattering on floor)

26:25.551 --> 26:27.687
Again.

26:29.355 --> 26:31.090
(indistinct conversations)

26:31.157 --> 26:33.726
("We Wish You
a Merry Christmas" playing)

26:33.793 --> 26:35.828
-Hey.
-Hi.

26:35.895 --> 26:38.030
Monroe, you made it.

26:38.097 --> 26:39.866
Yeah, I thought
I'd just stop by.

26:39.932 --> 26:42.068
Good. Let's go find Burt.

26:42.134 --> 26:43.402
Come on.

26:43.469 --> 26:45.705
Excuse us, guys.

26:45.772 --> 26:47.073
Well, speak of the devil.

26:47.139 --> 26:50.242
-Burt, this is...
-Monroe Stahr. -Hey.

26:50.309 --> 26:51.778
Pleasure to meet you.

26:51.844 --> 26:54.113
This is a Christmas party.

26:54.180 --> 26:57.817
I didn't know your people
celebrated Christmas, Monroe.

26:59.952 --> 27:01.487
-Gee, Burt.
-No, that's all right.

27:01.553 --> 27:04.123
That's all right, Clint.

27:05.591 --> 27:08.560
You know, I just remembered
a script that needs reading,

27:08.627 --> 27:11.330
but thanks for the offer.

27:11.397 --> 27:14.366
You have a lovely home, Burt.

27:14.433 --> 27:15.868
And merry Christmas.

27:17.904 --> 27:20.039
-(overlapping conversations)
-(music continues)

27:20.106 --> 27:22.942
BURT (singsongy):
Gordon, Judy.

27:23.009 --> 27:24.811
Welcome. Lovely to see you.

27:24.877 --> 27:28.114
Make yourselves at home.

27:36.789 --> 27:39.258
(engine starts)

27:42.328 --> 27:44.563
(engine stops)

27:44.630 --> 27:47.099
(music continues in distance)

27:52.471 --> 27:53.973
* Good King Wenceslas *

27:54.040 --> 27:57.744
* Last looked out
on the feast of Stephen *

27:57.810 --> 28:00.579
* When the snow lay
round about *

28:00.646 --> 28:02.448
* Deep and crisp and even *

28:02.514 --> 28:05.752
* Brightly shone
the moon that night *

28:05.818 --> 28:07.987
* Though the frost was cruel *

28:08.054 --> 28:10.957
* When a poor man
came in sight *

28:11.023 --> 28:14.827
* Gath'ring winter fuel *

28:14.894 --> 28:17.563
-* Hither, page, and stand
by me * -* Ooh, ooh, ooh *

28:17.629 --> 28:20.232
-* If thou know'st it, telling *
-* Ooh, ooh, ooh *

28:20.299 --> 28:23.135
-* Yonder peasant, who is he? *
-* Ooh, ooh, ooh *

28:23.202 --> 28:25.838
-* Where and what his
dwelling? * -* Ooh, ooh, ooh *

28:25.905 --> 28:27.673
* "Sire, he lives
a good league hence *

28:27.740 --> 28:30.777
* "Underneath the mountain *

28:30.843 --> 28:33.746
* "Right against
the forest fence *

28:33.813 --> 28:39.318
* By Saint Agnes' fountain." *

28:42.188 --> 28:45.357
LANG:
Repetition...

28:45.424 --> 28:50.262
is the only way
to make things real.

28:53.532 --> 28:57.369
Peter Lorre... "M"...

28:57.436 --> 29:01.373
his first scene,
he's supposed to whistle

29:01.440 --> 29:05.144
"In the Hall
of the Mountain King"...

29:05.211 --> 29:10.016
but he couldn't do it
without making it comic.

29:10.082 --> 29:15.321
You know how I wiped
the smile from his face?

29:15.387 --> 29:18.090
72 takes.

29:18.157 --> 29:21.427
In the end, whistling
was so painful for him,

29:21.493 --> 29:25.197
he finally knew what
kind of movie he was in

29:25.264 --> 29:29.468
and what working for me
was gonna be like.

29:29.535 --> 29:31.403
(toilet flushes)

29:31.470 --> 29:34.006
He was lucky to have you.

29:35.274 --> 29:37.176
(Kathleen sighs)

29:38.077 --> 29:41.948
(Kathleen groans)

29:42.014 --> 29:46.052
I hope we understand
each other now, Kathleen.

29:48.587 --> 29:50.589
Yes, Fritz.

29:50.656 --> 29:52.524
I understand you.

30:06.772 --> 30:08.274
What the hell is this?

30:08.340 --> 30:09.775
Ask Nathan.

30:09.842 --> 30:12.811
NATHAN:
I found him on the street.

30:12.879 --> 30:14.613
-It's our Christmas dinner.
-Max.

30:14.680 --> 30:16.348
-Is that my jacket?
-Max.

30:16.415 --> 30:17.950
-Get over there, get over there.
-Max.

30:23.455 --> 30:25.624
Hey.

30:25.691 --> 30:27.793
Hey, buddy, you got to scram.
You got to get out of here.

30:27.860 --> 30:29.195
(man shouting)

30:29.261 --> 30:31.663
-Stop!
-(Miner grunting)

30:31.730 --> 30:32.965
-Stop! Stop!
-(grunting)

30:33.032 --> 30:34.333
Oh, my God.

30:34.400 --> 30:37.569
Stop!

30:37.636 --> 30:41.073
* Adeste *

30:41.140 --> 30:45.577
* Fideles *

30:45.644 --> 30:51.150
* Laeti triumphantes *

30:51.217 --> 30:58.524
* Venite, venite... *

30:58.590 --> 31:05.031
* In Bethlehem... *

31:06.665 --> 31:09.468
* Natum *

31:09.535 --> 31:13.605
* Videte *

31:13.672 --> 31:15.607
* Regem *

31:15.674 --> 31:20.079
* Angelorum *

31:20.146 --> 31:22.581
* Venite *

31:22.648 --> 31:27.119
* Adoremus *

31:27.186 --> 31:30.122
* Venite *

31:30.189 --> 31:33.625
* Adoremus *

31:33.692 --> 31:37.529
* Venite *

31:37.596 --> 31:42.468
* Adoremus *

31:42.534 --> 31:50.642
* Dominum. *

31:50.709 --> 31:52.644
Hey, you got a pay phone?

31:52.711 --> 31:55.681
In back.

31:55.747 --> 31:58.617
Can I pour you anything?

31:58.684 --> 32:00.752
-Club soda.
-Got it.

32:00.819 --> 32:04.023
And another round
for the loving couple, on me.

32:04.090 --> 32:06.392
Hey, merry Christmas, friend.

32:06.458 --> 32:08.194
Merry Christmas.

32:10.829 --> 32:12.464
(coins clatter, bell dings)

32:12.531 --> 32:15.201
-(clears throat)
-WOMAN: Operator.

32:15.267 --> 32:17.636
Long distance, please.

32:17.703 --> 32:18.971
Oh, Mr. Brady,

32:19.038 --> 32:21.440
I've got a Mr. Perry
on the phone from...

32:21.507 --> 32:23.709
Chicago. Right.

32:23.775 --> 32:26.212
David, what's the good word?

32:30.482 --> 32:31.617
I see.

32:32.818 --> 32:35.487
I see.

32:35.554 --> 32:37.023
Thanks.

32:37.089 --> 32:40.426
Sure. Sure,
it could turn around.

32:40.492 --> 32:42.961
Yes, merry Christmas
to you, too.

32:45.931 --> 32:47.466
(pay phone rings)

32:50.636 --> 32:51.803
Yes?

32:51.870 --> 32:53.105
OPERATOR (over phone):
I'll connect you now.

32:53.172 --> 32:56.075
All right.

32:56.142 --> 32:57.776
MRS. STERNBERG (over phone):
Milton?

32:57.843 --> 32:59.445
Hi, Ma.

32:59.511 --> 33:00.946
MRS. STERNBERG:
Is something wrong?

33:01.013 --> 33:03.382
No, no, I just wanted
to say hello

33:03.449 --> 33:06.418
and, uh, merry Christmas.

33:06.485 --> 33:08.120
(chuckles)

33:08.187 --> 33:09.755
MRS. STERNBERG:
Merry...?

33:09.821 --> 33:11.123
It's 1:00 in the morning here.

33:11.190 --> 33:12.891
I know, I know, I'm sorry.

33:12.958 --> 33:17.196
Um, I realized I hadn't asked
you about your hip in a while.

33:17.263 --> 33:20.966
You-you said you were having
a hard time walking.

33:21.033 --> 33:23.669
That was five months ago,
darling.

33:23.735 --> 33:26.338
Last time you called.

33:26.405 --> 33:29.841
I guess you're right.

33:29.908 --> 33:31.410
Is it any better?

33:31.477 --> 33:33.145
(clears throat)

33:33.212 --> 33:37.116
No, I've just learned
not to mind it.

33:38.684 --> 33:40.619
How's work?

33:40.686 --> 33:43.021
Ah, work's fine.

33:43.089 --> 33:45.991
How's everything else?

33:46.058 --> 33:49.761
Are you seeing anyone?

33:49.828 --> 33:51.563
I am, actually.

33:51.630 --> 33:53.065
A very nice girl.

33:53.132 --> 33:54.466
Before you ask...

33:54.533 --> 33:56.302
before you ask
what you're about to ask,

33:56.368 --> 33:59.538
no, she isn't,
but she can cook.

33:59.605 --> 34:01.507
Hmm, wonderful.

34:01.573 --> 34:04.776
I hope you enjoy a lifetime of
ham sandwiches with mayonnaise.

34:04.843 --> 34:07.179
(laughs)

34:07.246 --> 34:10.782
I think you'd like her.

34:10.849 --> 34:13.719
What does she call you?

34:13.784 --> 34:15.321
What, Ma?

34:15.387 --> 34:18.724
This... this girl,
does she call you Milton?

34:18.790 --> 34:21.893
Or that other name?

34:21.960 --> 34:26.331
She calls me Monroe
like everyone else out here.

34:28.199 --> 34:31.337
Then I'm not so sure
I'd like her.

34:34.773 --> 34:36.108
Darling, it's late.

34:36.175 --> 34:39.010
Yeah, I'm sorry to wake you.

34:39.077 --> 34:40.246
Good night, Milton.

34:40.312 --> 34:41.813
Yeah, night, Ma.

34:52.391 --> 34:57.163
On second thought...
I'll take an Irish whiskey.

34:57.229 --> 34:59.531
BARTENDER:
Sure thing.

35:08.907 --> 35:12.678
It's dying... everywhere.

35:14.012 --> 35:19.985
They're staying away in droves,
even in the Midwest.

35:20.051 --> 35:21.420
It's over.

35:21.487 --> 35:23.989
We needed this to be a hit.

35:24.055 --> 35:25.891
The mortgage, the house...

35:25.957 --> 35:28.560
Mayer, Christ.

35:28.627 --> 35:32.130
It had to be a hit.
It had to be.

35:32.198 --> 35:36.868
Now... it's failing.

35:39.938 --> 35:41.740
I failed.

35:41.807 --> 35:44.042
Pat.

35:44.109 --> 35:46.878
(crying): I'm afraid I'm gonna
drag you down with me.

35:46.945 --> 35:48.113
Jesus.

35:48.180 --> 35:49.481
Pat.

35:52.951 --> 35:55.854
My mother warned me about you.

35:55.921 --> 35:57.122
She did?

35:57.189 --> 35:59.458
Yup.

35:59.525 --> 36:02.127
She said you were a bad bet...

36:02.194 --> 36:05.531
because you were so sure
of yourself.

36:07.933 --> 36:10.802
"A man like that

36:10.869 --> 36:13.905
"will never need you

36:13.972 --> 36:17.476
as much as he needs success."

36:17.543 --> 36:20.279
But you didn't listen.

36:20.346 --> 36:22.180
Course not.

36:22.248 --> 36:25.217
I loved you.

36:29.788 --> 36:33.292
And I believed you'd give me
attractive children.

36:37.696 --> 36:40.799
I do need you.

36:40.866 --> 36:43.269
My Rose.

36:43.335 --> 36:45.136
Well, let me tell you something.

36:45.203 --> 36:48.039
Pat Brady's a king.

36:48.106 --> 36:52.210
Pat Brady is a giant...

36:52.278 --> 36:55.981
bigger than any one picture.

36:56.047 --> 36:59.751
He owns all this...

37:01.820 --> 37:05.857
...and I still love him.

37:11.530 --> 37:13.999
Even crying like a baby?

37:14.065 --> 37:16.234
Especially crying like a baby.

37:19.037 --> 37:21.507
(Brady sighs)

37:23.609 --> 37:26.445
I don't deserve you.

37:26.512 --> 37:28.213
BARTENDER (voice-over):
Last call.

37:28.280 --> 37:30.482
STAHR:
Last call?

37:30.549 --> 37:32.250
Well, I'm trying to leave early.

37:32.318 --> 37:33.452
Christmas and all.

37:33.519 --> 37:35.954
Oh, yeah, of course. Sorry.

37:36.021 --> 37:38.790
(Stahr clears throat)

37:38.857 --> 37:41.760
Meeting up with my girl,

37:41.827 --> 37:45.597
then we go with her family
to their place for the day.

37:45.664 --> 37:46.832
You?

37:46.898 --> 37:49.234
I don't go in much
for Christmas. Keep it.

37:49.301 --> 37:50.602
Oh. Thanks.

37:50.669 --> 37:52.103
Why not?

37:52.170 --> 37:53.605
Jewish.

37:53.672 --> 37:57.709
Hmm. Well, what do Jewish folks
do for Christmas then?

37:57.776 --> 38:00.479
Ah, hide mostly.

38:00.546 --> 38:03.982
Growing up, I used to go
to the Yiddish theater

38:04.049 --> 38:07.252
with my uncle and father.

38:07.319 --> 38:08.954
But not anymore?

38:09.020 --> 38:11.823
-Mm.
-Why not?

38:11.890 --> 38:13.825
I don't know.

38:13.892 --> 38:16.328
Guess I'm not all that
Jewish anymore.

38:16.395 --> 38:19.030
Well, then what are you?

38:19.097 --> 38:20.899
I make pictures.

38:20.966 --> 38:22.534
Oh.

38:22.601 --> 38:25.337
Didn't know that was a religion.

38:25.404 --> 38:28.239
(chuckles)
It must be.

38:28.306 --> 38:32.143
Everyone in it
is constantly praying.

38:32.210 --> 38:33.812
Hey, you ever go?

38:33.879 --> 38:35.447
To the pictures?

38:35.514 --> 38:37.182
Can't say that I do.

38:37.248 --> 38:38.617
Why not?

38:38.684 --> 38:41.787
Y'all ain't really
making them for me.

38:43.689 --> 38:46.492
What do you think
they'd look like if we did?

38:47.559 --> 38:49.861
A bit more colorful, I suppose.

38:49.928 --> 38:52.063
Oh.

38:52.130 --> 38:54.600
I really got to be closing up.

39:00.171 --> 39:03.442
You got somewhere to go?

39:04.510 --> 39:06.077
Merry Christmas.

39:06.144 --> 39:08.614
(cello playing)

39:11.483 --> 39:13.952
* *

39:18.156 --> 39:20.258
HACKETT:
Hannah. (clears throat)

39:20.325 --> 39:21.460
Hannah.

39:22.728 --> 39:25.130
Hannah!

39:25.196 --> 39:28.500
(Hackett sighs)

39:28.567 --> 39:32.471
Can you just stop for a second?

39:34.506 --> 39:38.309
It was stupid
going to that church.

39:38.376 --> 39:39.945
It was a mistake.

39:40.011 --> 39:41.980
Why?

39:42.047 --> 39:43.582
I knew all of it.

39:43.649 --> 39:48.186
The sounds, the smell,

39:48.253 --> 39:50.055
the lights from the candles

39:50.121 --> 39:52.724
and that song.

39:52.791 --> 39:56.061
So familiar, like home...

39:58.530 --> 40:00.532
...except the faces.

40:03.535 --> 40:06.004
And I can't...

40:08.173 --> 40:10.842
That's all gone.

40:23.021 --> 40:26.157
I came to this country
when I was four.

40:28.760 --> 40:30.929
We didn't know a soul.

40:34.232 --> 40:36.935
No one knew us.

40:37.002 --> 40:38.570
No one cared to know
four more wops

40:38.637 --> 40:40.572
who couldn't speak
a lick of English.

40:40.639 --> 40:44.209
After work, my dad and I

40:44.275 --> 40:48.780
would wander through Manhattan,
up and down.

40:48.847 --> 40:52.918
And then one night
we hear this laughter

40:52.984 --> 40:55.086
coming from the theater--
it was a puppet show.

40:55.153 --> 40:59.491
So we go in, we sit down,
and I'm on his lap.

40:59.558 --> 41:01.560
And everyone around us
is howling,

41:01.627 --> 41:04.362
and I look up at my father,
and he's crying.

41:04.429 --> 41:07.398
And he's crying...

41:07.465 --> 41:09.801
because he had no idea

41:09.868 --> 41:12.403
what all these people
were laughing at.

41:12.470 --> 41:14.372
These strangers.

41:14.439 --> 41:16.708
He was miserable.

41:16.775 --> 41:20.111
But we went back
the next night...

41:20.178 --> 41:21.580
and the next.

41:21.647 --> 41:24.783
And he started to understand.

41:24.850 --> 41:28.453
And after a while, so did I--
I started to get the jokes,

41:28.520 --> 41:32.490
and these people started to feel
a little less like strangers.

41:42.200 --> 41:45.003
Go ahead, keep playing.

41:45.070 --> 41:47.773
I'll shut up.

41:56.081 --> 41:59.017
* *

42:29.114 --> 42:31.549
* *

42:43.094 --> 42:46.131
-Daddy, you can't clump it all
in one spot like that. -Well...

42:46.197 --> 42:47.966
It makes the tree
look lopsided.

42:48.033 --> 42:49.467
Why don't I just
watch you do it.

42:49.534 --> 42:50.669
You take such pleasure in it.

42:50.736 --> 42:52.470
-Try again.
-She'll give you notes.

42:52.537 --> 42:54.205
(door closes)

42:54.272 --> 42:55.907
(Brady chuckles)

42:55.974 --> 42:58.710
ANNIE MAE:
You all have a visitor.

42:58.777 --> 43:00.746
Merry Christmas.

43:03.982 --> 43:06.317
Uh, I'm empty-handed, sorry.

43:06.384 --> 43:08.053
Well, merry Christmas anyway.

43:08.119 --> 43:09.655
I hope you're crashing
our party

43:09.721 --> 43:11.556
to bring me some news
about the box office.

43:11.623 --> 43:12.991
I wish I could say so.

43:13.058 --> 43:14.760
The evening numbers
any better?

43:14.826 --> 43:16.862
If we're gonna talk
about that,

43:16.928 --> 43:18.363
I'm gonna need a real drink.

43:18.429 --> 43:20.365
(phone ringing)

43:20.431 --> 43:21.366
Uh, I'll get it, Annie Mae.

43:29.207 --> 43:32.310
STAHR (chuckles):
It's, uh...

43:32.377 --> 43:34.345
it's been a long night.

43:36.247 --> 43:37.749
I don't know what
I'm doing here.

43:37.816 --> 43:39.851
I don't either.

43:41.386 --> 43:43.655
This is our family Christmas.

43:43.722 --> 43:45.256
Of course it is.

43:45.323 --> 43:47.492
-(running footsteps)
-CELIA: Mother, it's Darla.

43:47.558 --> 43:49.761
Max is in the hospital.

44:15.253 --> 44:18.223
You guys don't like candy,
do you?

44:23.862 --> 44:26.064
So what happened?

44:26.131 --> 44:29.835
It's so stupid,
I don't want to say.

44:36.107 --> 44:39.945
Nathan and me were
walking home from the movie,

44:40.011 --> 44:43.081
and we saw this hobo
lying in the street.

44:44.382 --> 44:48.553
And Nathan asked,
"What if we brought him in?

44:48.619 --> 44:50.355
"Like in the picture?

44:50.421 --> 44:53.391
Give him food and stuff?"

44:55.626 --> 44:57.963
And so we did.

44:58.029 --> 45:00.531
Brought him home, fed him,

45:00.598 --> 45:02.868
like in the movie.

45:02.934 --> 45:05.236
Let him sleep in Max's bed.

45:05.303 --> 45:07.873
Then Max came home

45:07.939 --> 45:10.408
and asked the guy to leave.

45:12.310 --> 45:14.913
The guy beat him up
pretty bad.

45:23.321 --> 45:25.256
(Stahr sighs)

45:28.593 --> 45:32.630
You know, movies are stories.

45:32.697 --> 45:35.433
Right?

45:35.500 --> 45:37.735
They're not real life.

45:39.104 --> 45:41.439
They're better than real life.

45:43.508 --> 45:46.144
CELIA:
Darla, Nathan.

45:46.211 --> 45:47.645
He's awake.

45:47.712 --> 45:49.147
And he wants to see you two.

45:49.214 --> 45:51.249
Nathan.

45:55.053 --> 45:58.723
* Silent night *

45:58.790 --> 46:03.461
* Holy night *

46:03.528 --> 46:06.731
* All is calm *

46:06.798 --> 46:10.936
* And all is bright *

46:11.002 --> 46:14.305
* Round yon virgin *

46:14.372 --> 46:16.007
STAHR:
Rose?

46:16.074 --> 46:17.708
* Mother and child *

46:17.775 --> 46:20.045
Is she okay?

46:20.111 --> 46:21.712
* Holy infant *

46:21.779 --> 46:23.815
You need some company?

46:23.882 --> 46:27.953
* So tender and mild *

46:28.019 --> 46:30.321
* Full of *

46:30.388 --> 46:38.296
* Heavenly joy *

46:38.363 --> 46:41.399
* Full of *

46:41.466 --> 46:45.270
* Heavenly *

46:45.336 --> 46:49.975
* Joy. *

46:51.642 --> 46:55.146
VAJNA: This is what
you've reduced me to.

46:55.213 --> 46:58.549
Lending my house
to a pretentious Kraut,

46:58.616 --> 47:00.518
and then breaking into it,

47:00.585 --> 47:02.553
just to see you.

47:03.989 --> 47:05.423
I guess between your new job

47:05.490 --> 47:06.824
and your new boyfriend,

47:06.892 --> 47:09.260
you're never gonna
be alone anymore.

47:09.327 --> 47:11.796
(whispering):
Rupert, they'll hear you.

47:11.863 --> 47:14.099
You can drop the accent, Jane.
It's me.

47:15.633 --> 47:18.970
I thought we weren't gonna use
that name anymore.

47:19.037 --> 47:20.906
What is wrong with you?

47:20.972 --> 47:24.375
They're right down the hall.

47:24.442 --> 47:27.612
VAJNA: I don't like chasing you,
it's demeaning.

47:27.678 --> 47:30.048
And we're partners, right?

47:30.115 --> 47:34.852
Things have gotten...
complicated.

47:34.920 --> 47:37.455
Complicated? How?

47:37.522 --> 47:39.857
Monroe.

47:39.925 --> 47:41.927
Then they're not complicated
at all.

47:41.993 --> 47:44.795
We fell in love.

47:44.862 --> 47:46.998
Uh-uh.
Monroe doesn't love you,

47:47.065 --> 47:48.499
he doesn't even know you.

47:48.566 --> 47:51.970
He's in love with a character
you're playing,

47:52.037 --> 47:53.939
the reminder of his dead wife.

47:54.005 --> 47:56.807
That's why this worked,
you're a good actress.

47:56.874 --> 47:58.609
If he loved you,

47:58.676 --> 48:01.446
you wouldn't be here on
Christmas doing circus tricks

48:01.512 --> 48:03.481
for a pig like Lang.

48:03.548 --> 48:06.384
Remember that girl
who got off the bus

48:06.451 --> 48:08.886
from Wisconsin,

48:08.954 --> 48:10.755
and I took her in.

48:10.821 --> 48:12.523
Taught her an accent,

48:12.590 --> 48:14.926
turned her into someone
Monroe would notice.

48:14.993 --> 48:18.129
And then he did.

48:18.196 --> 48:21.166
That's called management.

48:21.232 --> 48:22.900
But management isn't free.

48:22.968 --> 48:24.535
You can't simply
walk away from it

48:24.602 --> 48:26.637
just because you've become
the First Lady of Malibu.

48:26.704 --> 48:28.673
-I just wanted to work.
-And you're working.

48:28.739 --> 48:29.941
Like I promised.

48:30.008 --> 48:32.043
-It's all happening.
-Shh.

48:32.110 --> 48:33.611
Everything you told me
you wanted.

48:33.678 --> 48:35.913
-Everything we dreamed of.
-(Kathleen sighs)

48:35.981 --> 48:37.448
And more.

48:37.515 --> 48:40.118
Of course, if this is all
too much for you,

48:40.185 --> 48:42.020
we can just go, right now.

48:42.087 --> 48:44.755
I'll put you on the next bus
back to Oshkosh.

48:44.822 --> 48:48.259
-Egg Harbor.
-Same difference.

48:52.063 --> 48:54.199
Is that what you want?

48:56.934 --> 48:59.537
(quietly):
No.

48:59.604 --> 49:01.239
Then say it.

49:02.873 --> 49:05.776
It's not what I want.

49:05.843 --> 49:07.078
Say it again.

49:07.145 --> 49:10.548
-It's not what I want.
-Good.

49:10.615 --> 49:12.984
'Cause we got plans.

49:23.928 --> 49:26.064
(waves crashing in distance)

49:30.401 --> 49:32.403
* *

50:11.509 --> 50:13.444
(laughs quietly)

50:29.827 --> 50:31.596
("Winter Wonderland" plays)

50:31.662 --> 50:36.467
* Sleigh bells ring,
are you listening... *

50:36.534 --> 50:38.069
Brady here.

50:38.136 --> 50:41.038
Yeah. Merry...
happy what-have-you.

50:41.106 --> 50:42.773
Give it to me straight.

50:42.840 --> 50:44.075
* We're happy tonight *

50:44.142 --> 50:45.710
* Walking
in a winter wonderland *

50:45.776 --> 50:47.578
Christ.

50:47.645 --> 50:49.780
That's terrific.

50:49.847 --> 50:51.782
Everywhere?

50:51.849 --> 50:55.019
Great. Great.

50:55.086 --> 50:57.021
No. I had a feeling.

50:57.088 --> 50:58.756
An overnight sensation, huh?

50:58.823 --> 51:01.226
Just like "The Devil to Pay!"
back in '30.

51:01.292 --> 51:03.161
Yeah. Listen, thanks.

51:03.228 --> 51:05.296
Thanks again.

51:06.864 --> 51:08.333
Good news, Mr. Brady?

51:08.399 --> 51:10.168
* Then pretend
he is Parson Brown *

51:10.235 --> 51:12.770
They came. Last night.

51:12.837 --> 51:16.441
And today, on Christmas Day,
a little miracle.

51:16.507 --> 51:19.377
People told other people,
it's snowballing everywhere.

51:19.444 --> 51:21.879
"Word of mouth."
How about that?

51:21.946 --> 51:23.848
Hey!

51:25.082 --> 51:27.152
I just ruined
Louis Mayer's day!

51:27.218 --> 51:29.254
* The plans that we've made *

51:29.320 --> 51:32.823
* Walking
in a winter wonderland *

51:32.890 --> 51:34.759

51:38.196 --> 51:41.199
Seen worse.

51:41.266 --> 51:43.401
* *

51:51.342 --> 51:54.379
Are you guys statues?

51:54.445 --> 51:55.780
Come on.

51:55.846 --> 51:58.883
Grab that broom.

51:58.949 --> 52:00.885
("Winter Wonderland" continues)

52:04.755 --> 52:06.891
(music fades)

52:11.762 --> 52:13.698
Monroe.

52:17.067 --> 52:20.538
I'm back.

52:21.872 --> 52:24.342
Wh...

52:30.215 --> 52:32.317
(kisses)

52:32.383 --> 52:34.785
I was so stupid
to send you away.

52:34.852 --> 52:37.121
(sighs)

52:37.188 --> 52:39.857
I don't want to be away
from you again.

52:39.924 --> 52:42.860
Not even for a second.

52:42.927 --> 52:44.362
KATHLEEN:
Um...

52:44.429 --> 52:48.433
I have something
I need to tell you.

52:49.066 --> 52:51.369
Sure.

52:56.641 --> 52:58.976
What is it?

52:59.043 --> 53:01.712
Um...

53:05.316 --> 53:07.918
Oh...

53:07.985 --> 53:11.155
It's been a long night.

53:11.222 --> 53:13.157
I'm tired.

53:13.224 --> 53:16.160
I'll tell you later.

53:16.227 --> 53:18.929
Marry me.

53:20.365 --> 53:21.832
It's what I want.

53:21.899 --> 53:24.469
-What?
-It's what I want for Christmas.

53:24.535 --> 53:28.138
I don't like who I am
when you're not around.

53:28.205 --> 53:31.108
Marry me.

53:31.175 --> 53:32.677
Yes?

("Winter Wonderland"
resumes playing)

53:34.245 --> 53:36.146
Yes.
