WEBVTT

00:11.857 --> 00:14.161
<i>But it's Saturday.</i>

00:14.195 --> 00:15.532
[gasps] It is?

00:15.565 --> 00:17.301
Then I'll ask
all the terrorists

00:17.334 --> 00:18.738
who threaten
to destroy our world

00:18.771 --> 00:20.240
to take the day off.

00:20.274 --> 00:23.480
I just mean I had plans
to spend the day with AJ.

00:23.514 --> 00:25.183
And AJ is?

00:25.217 --> 00:27.656
My daughter.
Ah, children.

00:27.689 --> 00:29.726
The time goes so fast,

00:29.760 --> 00:31.697
but we're all
making sacrifices.

00:31.730 --> 00:33.634
Excuse me, waiter?

00:33.668 --> 00:35.304
More champagne
in the next one.

00:39.513 --> 00:42.151
Calling you on a Saturday.

00:42.184 --> 00:44.288
It's a simple pickup.
An hour max.

00:44.322 --> 00:46.794
Especially with--
- No, no, no.

00:46.827 --> 00:48.430
Please don't say it.

00:48.463 --> 00:50.133
Agent Archer as backup.

00:50.167 --> 00:52.404
Archer on a Saturday?

00:52.438 --> 00:54.475
As in the day
after Friday night?

00:54.509 --> 00:56.179
I don't see the problem.

00:56.212 --> 00:58.751
Obviously.
Have you talked to him yet?

00:58.784 --> 01:00.254
No, actually.

01:00.287 --> 01:02.258
He hasn't picked up the phone
for some reason.

01:02.291 --> 01:05.230
Oh, yeah, "for some reason."

01:14.583 --> 01:17.722
Hey, Archer.

01:17.756 --> 01:19.693
No.

01:59.271 --> 02:00.541
Yes,
a shower was necessary, Lana.

02:00.575 --> 02:02.846
It was a night of many fluids.

02:02.879 --> 02:05.718
First of all, gross.
It really was.

02:05.752 --> 02:07.822
Second of all, hurry up.

02:07.856 --> 02:09.860
I had a whole special day
planned with AJ.

02:09.893 --> 02:11.830
Coney Island,
a fancy tea place.

02:11.864 --> 02:14.435
Moist yet firm skin
doesn't just happen, Lana.

02:14.468 --> 02:16.272
I'm on step two of ten.

02:16.306 --> 02:17.842
Hey, do you see
a pumice stone out there?

02:17.876 --> 02:20.180
Fabian wants us to pick up
a negotiation specialist.

02:20.213 --> 02:21.550
The Broker.

02:21.583 --> 02:22.852
He's worked
with all the major players;

02:22.886 --> 02:25.290
Mafia, Yakuza, dictators,
dirty cops.

02:25.324 --> 02:26.660
Cops!

02:26.694 --> 02:28.597
There was something
with police last night.

02:29.966 --> 02:32.672
Whoo-hoo! Police horse!

02:36.312 --> 02:38.450
Yeah,
there's no way that happened.

02:38.483 --> 02:40.454
Then explain
these lance callouses.

02:40.487 --> 02:43.627
Anyway, the Broker's
a longtime go-between

02:43.661 --> 02:45.464
for criminal groups,
which means he has intel

02:45.497 --> 02:47.401
on all of them.
But now he's retiring,

02:47.434 --> 02:49.873
so they all want to torture him
for info and then kill him,

02:49.906 --> 02:52.444
which means your shower routine
could cost a man his life

02:52.478 --> 02:54.583
and me my day with AJ.

02:54.616 --> 02:55.885
Hello?

02:55.918 --> 02:58.289
[muffled] Sorry,
step five is a face wash.

02:58.323 --> 03:00.227
Let's skip to step ten.

03:03.233 --> 03:04.736
It's not a big deal, Robert.

03:04.770 --> 03:07.241
Just take AJ to the office
instead of my place.

03:07.274 --> 03:09.646
It's not about
the physical distance, Lana.

03:09.679 --> 03:12.351
It's the emotional distance
from you working

03:12.384 --> 03:13.521
instead of spending time
with AJ.

03:13.554 --> 03:14.790
I'm not working.

03:14.823 --> 03:17.461
I just wanna show AJ
where Mommy works.

03:17.494 --> 03:18.931
Depressing even if true.

03:18.964 --> 03:20.535
Shut up.
Is that Archer?

03:20.568 --> 03:22.371
- No, it's--
- Hey, Robert.

03:22.404 --> 03:23.373
I wanna remind you,

03:23.406 --> 03:25.210
<i>these are formative years
for AJ.</i>

03:25.243 --> 03:26.714
One day you'll look back
and wish--

03:26.747 --> 03:28.517
That you didn't tell me
how to parent?

03:28.551 --> 03:29.720
I agree.

03:29.753 --> 03:31.657
So since you are working--

03:31.690 --> 03:33.359
love the lying to Robert,
by the way--

03:33.393 --> 03:34.796
who exactly
is taking care of AJ?

03:34.830 --> 03:36.365
Seriously?

03:36.399 --> 03:37.936
Yeah, Pam,
I'm really sorry. I--

03:37.969 --> 03:39.906
No, I mean, this is amazing.

03:39.940 --> 03:42.545
Aunt Pam is gonna plan
so many great activities.

03:42.579 --> 03:45.818
Not to go all Ms. Frizzle,
but I might steal a bus.

03:45.852 --> 03:48.356
Just be at the office
in 15 minutes, okay?

03:48.389 --> 03:50.661
And one other thing...

03:50.695 --> 03:53.501
- Hello, Pam. Where is--
- Lana's upstairs.

03:53.534 --> 03:55.938
She just sent me down to get AJ
to bring her upstairs

03:55.972 --> 03:58.611
to Lana, who we've established
is upstairs.

03:58.644 --> 04:00.615
And she can't come
down because...

04:00.648 --> 04:02.284
She...

04:02.317 --> 04:03.954
got her period.
- Oh.

04:03.988 --> 04:05.792
That's a few days early
for her,

04:05.825 --> 04:07.896
so I guess
she would be unprepared.

04:07.929 --> 04:10.400
AJ, you ready to come along
with Aunt Pammy?

04:10.434 --> 04:11.837
No,
I don't want to call you that.

04:11.870 --> 04:13.440
We've been working
on boundaries.

04:13.473 --> 04:14.843
Oh, that's okay.

04:14.876 --> 04:16.847
I'll just have to earn it

04:16.880 --> 04:19.051
with activities!

04:19.084 --> 04:21.289
Activities with Lana?

04:21.322 --> 04:22.525
Sure.

04:22.559 --> 04:24.395
All right, there's the Broker.

04:24.428 --> 04:26.733
But Fabian says he's paranoid,
so don't spook him or--

04:26.767 --> 04:28.904
Hey, Broker!
Broker, over here.

04:28.938 --> 04:30.842
Damn it, Archer.

04:30.875 --> 04:33.379
I'm too hungover
for subterfuge, Lana.

04:33.413 --> 04:35.785
Uh, are you Broker,
or possibly "the Broker"?

04:35.818 --> 04:37.522
Depends on who's asking.

04:37.555 --> 04:38.958
Vagueness, that's fun.

04:38.991 --> 04:41.462
Hi. Look, we're here
on orders from Fabian.

04:41.496 --> 04:44.803
Orders? Someone has the two
of you working on a Saturday?

04:44.836 --> 04:47.542
How awful!
- Ugh, do not get me started.

04:47.575 --> 04:49.345
I had a whole day planned
with my daughter.

04:49.378 --> 04:50.848
And I planned last night
around a day

04:50.882 --> 04:53.486
that would let me lay
passed out near, but not in,

04:53.521 --> 04:55.423
a pool of vomit.
- Oh, how dreadful!

04:55.457 --> 04:57.094
My sympathies
to the both of you.

04:57.127 --> 04:58.831
Oh, it's okay. I just--

04:58.864 --> 05:00.501
wait, how did we get on this?

05:00.535 --> 05:01.870
Fabian wants us to take you in.

05:01.904 --> 05:03.741
Oh, Fabian sent you.

05:03.774 --> 05:05.611
Oh, my apologies.

05:05.645 --> 05:07.314
You see, as a negotiator,

05:07.347 --> 05:09.018
I often get people
to talk about themselves

05:09.051 --> 05:11.422
as a distraction
if I need an easy escape.

05:11.455 --> 05:13.561
I call it "instant intimacy."

05:13.594 --> 05:16.365
Wait, so you weren't actually
sympathizing with me?

05:16.399 --> 05:17.635
Oh, no,
with you, it was real.

05:17.669 --> 05:19.506
But there are a lot of people
after me.

05:19.539 --> 05:20.775
Can't be too careful.

05:20.808 --> 05:23.848
Speaking of,
Fabian and I had a code word.

05:23.881 --> 05:26.620
Code word? Uh, one moment.

05:29.091 --> 05:30.761
- Ooh.

05:33.534 --> 05:35.437
Might be hard
to get that info.

05:35.470 --> 05:36.707
I have a code phrase.

05:36.740 --> 05:38.644
"This was a one-hour job,
and I have a gun."

05:38.677 --> 05:41.650
Archer! But, yeah, sorry.
We are in a rush.

05:41.683 --> 05:43.988
Do you have kids?
- Ah, flashbang!

05:44.021 --> 05:45.758
Damn it.

05:45.791 --> 05:48.363
He got away.
-  Like I give a shit.

05:48.396 --> 05:51.402
What's my one rule?
-  No more flashbangs.

05:51.435 --> 05:53.373
No more flashbangs.

05:53.406 --> 05:55.010
My otolaryngologist
already said

05:55.043 --> 05:56.647
I'll be lucky
if I'm not deaf by 50.

05:56.680 --> 05:58.684
There!
He's going for the platform.

06:01.455 --> 06:02.825
biker: What the hell?

06:02.859 --> 06:04.428
Hey, pal, I'm the one
who should be mad.

06:04.461 --> 06:05.665
This is a shit bike.

06:15.116 --> 06:18.691
Jesus, shouldn't these be
motorcycle accessible by now?

06:26.707 --> 06:28.443
Damn it. Hey!

06:28.476 --> 06:30.180
Has anyone seen
a mischievous little man?

06:30.213 --> 06:32.852
Yay high?
Strange air of sophistication?

06:32.885 --> 06:34.522
Lana? How did you--

06:34.556 --> 06:35.791
I got on the train, Archer.

06:35.825 --> 06:37.862
The "being good at your job"
option.

06:37.895 --> 06:39.733
Ooh, that one's fun.

06:39.766 --> 06:41.135
It teaches you animals
in English

06:41.168 --> 06:43.574
and en EspaÃ±ol.

06:43.607 --> 06:46.914
Uh, they used puerco for pig,
but cerdo is more common.

06:46.947 --> 06:48.984
Cool!
This one's a coloring book.

06:49.018 --> 06:50.855
Pam,
when is my mom getting here?

06:51.890 --> 06:53.459
Pam? AJ?

06:53.493 --> 06:55.096
Cyril? Why are you here?

06:55.130 --> 06:57.134
Oh,
just burning the midnight oil,

06:57.167 --> 07:00.440
but midday.
That midday oil.

07:00.473 --> 07:03.012
And why are you dressed
so casually?

07:03.046 --> 07:04.983
Fine, Pam, you got me.

07:05.016 --> 07:07.020
Sometimes I come in on weekends
to be at work

07:07.054 --> 07:08.891
but feel like I can goof off.

07:08.924 --> 07:10.093
Well, why don't you just--

07:10.126 --> 07:11.462
The thought of goofing off

07:11.495 --> 07:13.600
during real work hours
terrifies me.

07:13.634 --> 07:14.936
Lame.

07:14.970 --> 07:16.974
Um,
I wanna do something else.

07:17.007 --> 07:19.211
Like play
with a pretty dolly maybe?

07:19.244 --> 07:21.850
- Ha! Hyah!
- Ah!

07:21.883 --> 07:24.455
FYI,
she's working on boundaries.

07:24.488 --> 07:26.593
That's a good boundary.

07:26.627 --> 07:29.966
And it gives me an idea.
Activities!

07:30.000 --> 07:31.637
Well, the thing
you have to understand

07:31.670 --> 07:33.574
is I'm an amateur marathoner,

07:33.607 --> 07:35.143
so it's easy for me
to outrun people.

07:35.176 --> 07:36.913
Maybe average people, not me.

07:36.947 --> 07:38.249
Says the guy I just outran.

07:38.282 --> 07:40.855
Ha! Getting on a train
doesn't count.

07:40.888 --> 07:42.792
Enough.
I'm sorry we chased you,

07:42.825 --> 07:44.495
but we do work for Fabian.

07:44.529 --> 07:46.265
He's just hard to reach
on a Saturday.

07:46.298 --> 07:48.169
- Must be nice.
- Well, I'm still alive,

07:48.202 --> 07:50.173
so I'm inclined to believe you.

07:50.206 --> 07:52.779
But let me ask,
as agents for Fabian,

07:52.812 --> 07:55.851
do you think he's being honest
about his intent to help me?

07:57.187 --> 07:58.857
Aha! You don't trust him.

07:58.891 --> 08:00.728
- It's not--
- Not at all. 0%.

08:00.761 --> 08:02.197
- Well, time to run again.
- Wait.

08:02.230 --> 08:04.803
There are people out there
who actually want to kill you,

08:04.836 --> 08:06.072
and they could be anywhere.

08:06.105 --> 08:09.078
Freeze!
The Broker's coming with us.

08:09.111 --> 08:10.681
No! He comes with us.

08:13.052 --> 08:15.791
Does no one
take the weekend off?

08:19.699 --> 08:20.935
Okay, clearly a lot happen

08:20.968 --> 08:22.505
Can we just do
a quick roll call?

08:22.538 --> 08:24.509
- Nyet.
- Copy that, Russian Mafia.

08:24.542 --> 08:26.145
Well, God damn it, Dmitri.

08:26.178 --> 08:28.784
- Eh, can we get a move on here?
- Oh, and classic Mafia.

08:28.817 --> 08:29.953
Thanks, everyone.

08:29.986 --> 08:32.892
Looks like we have
Mexican standoff.

08:32.925 --> 08:35.296
Easy,
we don't use that term anymore.

08:35.330 --> 08:37.234
Plus, none of us
want to kill each other,

08:37.267 --> 08:41.108
so it's more of a multicultural
awkward dinner party.

08:41.142 --> 08:43.246
Can you not antagonize
the mobsters?

08:43.279 --> 08:45.150
Big hand friend is smart.

08:45.183 --> 08:48.824
Now, give us Broker
and no one gets hurt.

08:48.857 --> 08:50.795
Except Broker, obviously.

08:50.828 --> 08:52.197
Hey, new idea.

08:52.230 --> 08:54.769
I keep the Broker,
and everyone else gets hurt

08:54.803 --> 08:57.107
because he's under the
protection of Sterling Archer.

08:59.044 --> 09:01.616
The world greatest spy.

09:01.650 --> 09:03.252
I work for The Agency.

09:03.286 --> 09:05.758
Should that mean something?

09:05.791 --> 09:07.260
- Gentlemen, gentlemen!

09:07.294 --> 09:10.066
Might I suggest an alternative
where no one gets hurt,

09:10.100 --> 09:11.937
especially me?
I mean, I get it.

09:11.970 --> 09:14.676
No one wants their secrets out.
I'd want me dead too.

09:14.709 --> 09:16.613
Right,
oh, it's nothing personal.

09:16.646 --> 09:18.784
For sure. You are okay guy.

09:18.817 --> 09:22.257
Look, comrade, I get it.
I mean, I've got secrets too.

09:22.290 --> 09:24.929
Gosh, if people knew
that my grand-meemaw

09:24.963 --> 09:26.867
still makes dinner
for me every Sunday...

09:26.900 --> 09:29.104
Oh, my babushka does too.

09:29.138 --> 09:31.008
Come on, so does my nonna.

09:31.041 --> 09:34.214
Every Sunday night, she makes
a parmigiana could blow the--

09:34.248 --> 09:36.953
Oh, damn it.
He did it again.

09:36.987 --> 09:38.791
Hey, did you know
he runs marathons?

09:38.824 --> 09:40.160
He must bring that up a lot.

09:40.193 --> 09:43.032
- Ah, a lot.
- Everyone, stop.

09:43.065 --> 09:45.871
We want the Broker.
- Ha, get in line, buddy.

09:45.905 --> 09:48.242
Hiroshi!
Oh, we haven't seen the Yakuza

09:48.276 --> 09:50.714
since the Seattle negotiation.

09:50.748 --> 09:52.384
And now we have to outrun
a marathoner

09:52.417 --> 09:54.689
and three
criminal organizations

09:54.722 --> 09:57.360
on a Saturday, Lana!
- No, we don't.

09:57.394 --> 09:59.699
I put a tracker on the Broker
while we had him.

09:59.732 --> 10:03.106
Because we always lose them.

10:03.139 --> 10:05.176
Ready, AJ?
I'm not gonna go easy on you

10:05.210 --> 10:07.380
just because you're a--ah!

10:07.414 --> 10:10.353
- Whew. Let's go again.
- Damn, AJ.

10:10.386 --> 10:11.890
Where'd you learn to fight?

10:11.923 --> 10:13.359
My mom signed me up
for judo classes

10:13.392 --> 10:15.029
to help my self-confidence.
Hyah!

10:15.063 --> 10:16.867
Ah!

10:16.900 --> 10:19.271
You know, there's such a thing
as too much confidence.

10:19.304 --> 10:20.774
Now remember, AJ,

10:20.808 --> 10:22.645
your opponent won't always
fight clean,

10:22.678 --> 10:24.849
so it's good to mix in
some dirty boxing.

10:24.883 --> 10:27.020
Eyes, throat, groin.

10:27.053 --> 10:29.726
Or standard boxing,
hold the dirt.

10:29.759 --> 10:31.228
Yah!
- Ooh!

10:31.262 --> 10:32.899
Damn.

10:32.932 --> 10:34.268
Hey, Pam,
we're still on mission,

10:34.301 --> 10:36.205
but we should be done soon.
How's AJ?

10:36.238 --> 10:38.142
Great.
She's playing with Cyril.

10:38.176 --> 10:40.648
No, no, no, no, no!

10:40.681 --> 10:42.250
Toying with him anyway.

10:42.284 --> 10:44.756
Can you tell her I'll only
be gone a little bit longer?

10:44.789 --> 10:46.960
Plus her next few birthdays
and most holidays.

10:46.993 --> 10:48.797
Uh, you want me to say
that second part?

10:48.831 --> 10:51.368
No.
Ah!

10:51.402 --> 10:52.905
Hmm. Too easy.

10:52.939 --> 10:54.308
Can we do something else?

10:55.845 --> 10:58.049
I'm not sure Krieger's lab
is the best place

10:58.082 --> 10:59.451
for a child.
- Preteen.

10:59.484 --> 11:01.957
And why are you still in pads?

11:01.990 --> 11:04.394
That last throw--
which I let you do--

11:04.428 --> 11:07.067
jammed the zipper.
- It'll be fine.

11:07.100 --> 11:09.371
Just don't touch anything
or listen to anything

11:09.404 --> 11:10.841
that tells you to free it.

11:10.875 --> 11:12.277
Dang it, locked.

11:12.310 --> 11:15.784
Probably for the best.
Now who wants--

11:15.818 --> 11:18.022
My mom always keeps
an extra bobby pin in her hair,

11:18.055 --> 11:19.391
so I do too.

11:19.424 --> 11:21.897
Is it normal to be
intimidated by a child?

11:21.930 --> 11:23.432
For you? Absolutely.

11:23.466 --> 11:25.270
Oh, you gotta be kidding me!

11:25.303 --> 11:26.806
The tracker says
he's in there.

11:26.840 --> 11:29.077
So now I'm at Coney Island
without my daughter.

11:29.111 --> 11:30.446
Yeah,
it's not a good look for you.

11:30.480 --> 11:33.185
Oh, my God!
- You see him?

11:33.219 --> 11:36.258
- Oh, I see him.
- We are mid-mission!

11:36.292 --> 11:38.262
And mid-Saturday!

11:39.532 --> 11:42.170
Wow!
Is that a Raman spectrometer?

11:42.204 --> 11:44.107
Maybe. How do you know that?

11:44.141 --> 11:45.844
Mom sent me to science camp.

11:45.878 --> 11:47.380
It was right after
musical theater camp.

11:47.414 --> 11:48.917
We did a production of "Stomp!"

11:48.951 --> 11:50.854
Aunt Pammy would love
to see that!

11:50.888 --> 11:53.961
Not calling you that,
and I don't perform on command.

11:53.994 --> 11:56.733
- Great boundaries!
- Whoa.

11:56.766 --> 11:58.302
A sensory deprivation tank?

11:58.336 --> 12:00.273
But why does it have
so many wires?

12:00.306 --> 12:01.910
AJ, no!

12:01.943 --> 12:03.513
Ah! It's opening!
- Kill whatever comes out.

12:03.547 --> 12:05.517
What day is it?

12:05.551 --> 12:08.857
- It's... Saturday.
- What year?

12:08.890 --> 12:10.928
The same one.

12:10.961 --> 12:13.967
You are unbelievable.

12:14.001 --> 12:16.038
I know, winning Poinkers
on my first try?

12:16.071 --> 12:17.407
You know
how impressive that is?

12:17.440 --> 12:19.244
They glue those bottles down, Lana.

12:19.278 --> 12:21.348
I'll be impressed
if you help me find the Broker

12:21.382 --> 12:22.752
and get back to AJ.

12:22.785 --> 12:24.923
I actually got this for AJ.

12:24.956 --> 12:28.095
I know what it's like to have
a mother who's neglectful--

12:29.999 --> 12:31.435
And withholding.

12:31.468 --> 12:33.874
Wait, there he is.
Ugh, can we not?

12:36.278 --> 12:37.915
- Ah!

12:37.949 --> 12:40.086
Ah!

12:40.119 --> 12:41.790
Honestly,
I'm glad it's you two.

12:41.823 --> 12:44.194
You seem like my best option.
- Of all bad options.

12:44.227 --> 12:45.998
But Fabian's better
than the criminals

12:46.031 --> 12:47.467
who want to kill you.
- Eh, tough call.

12:47.500 --> 12:49.237
Stop making this take longer!

12:49.271 --> 12:50.908
I've already lost
half the day with AJ.

12:50.941 --> 12:52.477
Half the day of one weekend.

12:52.511 --> 12:54.448
It's not one weekend.

12:54.481 --> 12:56.285
There's always some mission
or emergency

12:56.318 --> 12:58.122
or moron
who won't take our help--

12:58.155 --> 13:01.295
no offense--I just feel like
I'm blowing it as a mother.

13:01.328 --> 13:03.065
- I know how you feel.
- You have kids?

13:03.099 --> 13:05.069
Oh, God, no.
Had an absent mother.

13:05.103 --> 13:07.107
It drove me to a life of crime.

13:07.140 --> 13:09.244
Please? Please, Pam?

13:09.277 --> 13:11.181
Okay, just this once.

13:11.215 --> 13:13.386
This feels like
really bad babysitting.

13:13.419 --> 13:15.557
- We're not giving her a gun.
- It's okay.

13:15.591 --> 13:17.093
Grandma gave me
shooting lessons

13:17.127 --> 13:18.496
every year for my birthday,

13:18.530 --> 13:20.834
except when I was in Europe
because she said,

13:20.868 --> 13:22.337
"They traded the right
to bear arms

13:22.370 --> 13:23.974
for having limp fries."

13:24.007 --> 13:26.813
Fine,
but no automatic weapons.

13:30.420 --> 13:31.990
Nobody move.

13:32.023 --> 13:34.562
- Aw, hi there, kitty.

13:34.595 --> 13:37.167
- AJ, you shouldn't--
- Rah!

13:37.200 --> 13:39.505
That's what you sound like.

13:39.539 --> 13:42.110
Aw, look how ferocious you are.

13:42.143 --> 13:44.014
A ferocious little predator.

13:44.047 --> 13:46.318
What in the damn
zookeeper hell?

13:46.352 --> 13:48.189
Language, Pam.

13:48.222 --> 13:50.259
- What are you doing here?
- It's Saturday.

13:50.293 --> 13:52.965
Babou likes to use weekends
to mark new territory.

13:52.998 --> 13:54.936
So that means
the shooting range

13:54.969 --> 13:56.940
is now covered in ocelot urine?
- Yeah!

13:56.973 --> 13:58.910
Let's say it's just
the shooting range.

14:02.017 --> 14:04.321
That's...
alarmingly good grouping.

14:04.354 --> 14:06.526
Holy crap!
Who are you, even?

14:06.559 --> 14:08.295
It's just a hobby.

14:08.329 --> 14:09.999
Seriously, who is this kid?

14:10.033 --> 14:12.070
- Hmm, that's weird.

14:14.041 --> 14:15.577
How does it not worry you?

14:15.611 --> 14:17.548
Most things don't worry me,
and I don't know

14:17.581 --> 14:19.619
what you're talking about,
so those two reasons.

14:19.652 --> 14:22.357
I mean the idea
that we're ruining AJ.

14:22.390 --> 14:24.562
Lana, a million things
will ruin AJ.

14:24.595 --> 14:27.500
Us, weird friends,
a bad week at summer camp.

14:27.535 --> 14:30.006
Wait, that's your answer?
"She's already ruined"?

14:30.039 --> 14:31.442
I loved my summer camp.

14:31.475 --> 14:33.580
I keep my jogging shoes
in the basket I made.

14:33.613 --> 14:35.551
We get it, you run!

14:35.584 --> 14:37.420
We're all messed up
by something, Lana.

14:37.454 --> 14:39.659
There's murderers
with great parents.

14:39.692 --> 14:42.130
All you can do
is what you're already doing.

14:42.163 --> 14:44.635
Try your best
and hope you get lucky.

14:44.669 --> 14:47.240
That--actually helps
a little.

14:47.273 --> 14:49.077
Thanks.

14:49.111 --> 14:51.148
Hey, Pam, we've got the Broker.
Everything's fine.

14:51.181 --> 14:52.518
we'll be back at the office
in ten minutes.

14:52.551 --> 14:53.653
Cool.

14:53.687 --> 14:55.991
Uh, might want to make it sooner.

14:56.024 --> 14:57.962
Oh, boy.

15:02.370 --> 15:03.406
Why would all these criminal

15:03.439 --> 15:04.976
go to our office?

15:05.009 --> 15:06.613
Maybe because
an idiot told them who he was

15:06.646 --> 15:07.982
and where he worked.

15:08.015 --> 15:09.351
I mean, that's one option.

15:09.384 --> 15:11.689
To be clear,
we're driving toward a building

15:11.723 --> 15:13.960
full of people who want
to torture and kill me?

15:13.994 --> 15:15.363
Correct?
- I don't wanna put plans

15:15.396 --> 15:17.100
in their mouths, but probably.

15:17.133 --> 15:18.970
Ah.
Then I'll be getting out now.

15:19.004 --> 15:20.641
You didn't check him
for weapons?

15:20.674 --> 15:22.310
It's Saturday!

15:22.343 --> 15:23.547
You can just pull over anywhere.

15:23.580 --> 15:25.116
Oh, shoot me.

15:25.149 --> 15:27.454
I am saving my daughter,
you jackhole.

15:27.487 --> 15:29.525
No sense dying
for her daughter.

15:29.559 --> 15:31.529
Uh, technically
she's my daughter too.

15:31.563 --> 15:33.332
You two have
a child together?

15:33.365 --> 15:34.702
Yes, but not through sex.

15:34.735 --> 15:36.706
This woman took my sperm
to have a baby.

15:36.739 --> 15:39.979
Oh, my God.
- Go on.

15:40.012 --> 15:41.181
Yeah,
and then she never told me.

15:41.215 --> 15:42.685
I told you when I was ready.

15:42.718 --> 15:45.123
After AJ was born
during a coup.

15:45.156 --> 15:47.293
Not that you cared,
because you abandoned her.

15:47.327 --> 15:49.397
So you faked a kidnapping
to make me care?

15:49.431 --> 15:51.068
Only the first kidnapping.

15:51.101 --> 15:52.571
The other one was real.

15:52.605 --> 15:54.474
Anyway,
she's back from Switzerland,

15:54.509 --> 15:56.011
she barely knows me
as a father,

15:56.044 --> 15:58.282
and her mother
is going through a divorce.

15:58.315 --> 16:01.288
You know what?
We gotta save this kid.

16:03.192 --> 16:04.361
Listen up, people.

16:04.394 --> 16:06.331
Until Archer and Lana get back,

16:06.365 --> 16:08.670
as the babysitter,
I'm in charge.

16:08.703 --> 16:11.308
- Yeah, of the kid.
- You wanna try me?

16:11.341 --> 16:13.312
Not yet, but keep yelling!

16:13.345 --> 16:15.216
You three,
load up in the armory

16:15.249 --> 16:17.020
then run and gun these mofos.

16:17.053 --> 16:19.759
- AJ, "mofos" means--
- I know.

16:19.792 --> 16:22.565
I'll find AJ a place to hide
until it's over.

16:22.598 --> 16:24.334
Over meaning we win?

16:24.367 --> 16:25.771
Sure.

16:30.213 --> 16:33.118
Ah, not this again.
Oh, well.

16:35.356 --> 16:36.526
Wait, wait, wait.

16:36.559 --> 16:38.730
We all want same thing, yes?

16:38.763 --> 16:40.601
The Broker dead and bloody.

16:40.634 --> 16:44.040
Then maybe we work together, comrades.

16:44.074 --> 16:46.044
Oh, come on, look at us.

16:46.078 --> 16:48.449
The Broker connecting us
one last time.

16:48.482 --> 16:50.319
This guy's the glue, you know?

16:50.353 --> 16:53.325
God bless
that soon-to-be dead man.

16:55.229 --> 16:56.599
Can't you rig up an explosive

16:56.633 --> 16:58.269
that will take them out
all at once?

16:58.302 --> 17:00.507
Hey,
no backseat bomb building.

17:00.541 --> 17:02.745
Yeah, we didn't tell you how
to make your terrible ties.

17:02.778 --> 17:04.247
Wait,
you think I make my ties?

17:06.251 --> 17:07.220
Ah!

17:11.194 --> 17:12.565
AJ, I need you to hide
in the lab.

17:12.598 --> 17:14.167
But I can help.

17:14.200 --> 17:15.737
I swear, I'm ready.

17:15.771 --> 17:18.475
I know you are, honey,
but you shouldn't have to be,

17:18.510 --> 17:20.079
so Pam's got this one,

17:20.112 --> 17:22.618
whether you call her
Aunt Pammy or not.

17:22.651 --> 17:24.522
All right, fellas!

17:24.555 --> 17:28.362
Don't tell Mom the babysitter's
about to kick your ass!

17:33.138 --> 17:34.775
Ah!
Taking a lot of bullets here.

17:34.809 --> 17:36.779
Do you want me
to rush this bomb?

17:36.813 --> 17:39.317
No,
but I don't love being shot.

17:39.351 --> 17:41.154
And I don't love criticism.

17:41.188 --> 17:43.125
Wait, wait, wait, you didn't
isolate the blast radius.

17:43.158 --> 17:44.427
It'll take us all out--

17:46.198 --> 17:48.570
How are we not dead?

17:48.603 --> 17:50.774
I built it so all the murder
went that way.

17:50.807 --> 17:53.412
Are you
our demolitions expert now?

17:53.445 --> 17:56.318
It's more of a hobby/religion
for me.

17:56.351 --> 17:58.155
Come out, little girl.

17:58.188 --> 18:00.326
Ivan will not hurt you.

18:00.359 --> 18:03.265
Ivan will just trade you
for Broker...

18:03.299 --> 18:05.537
and give puppy.

18:05.570 --> 18:07.708
You like puppy, huh?

18:12.618 --> 18:14.722
This is for making me

18:14.755 --> 18:16.826
come to the office

18:16.859 --> 18:18.830
on a Saturday!

18:18.863 --> 18:21.669
Sorry. Apologies.
Jacob, always a pleasure.

18:23.439 --> 18:24.407
Ah!

18:29.619 --> 18:31.421
Tell me where my daughter is,

18:31.455 --> 18:33.425
or I will rip out your eyes,
shove them up your ass

18:33.459 --> 18:35.564
so that you watch my fist
punch down your throat.

18:35.597 --> 18:37.635
I don't even know
who you are.

18:37.668 --> 18:39.204
Ah!
- Mommy!

18:39.237 --> 18:42.176
- AJ!
- Ah!

18:42.210 --> 18:44.715
Sweetie, what did we say
about gunfights?

18:44.749 --> 18:47.487
- Serpentine!
- Oh, how adorably competent.

18:48.757 --> 18:50.661
Right, drop your guns.
Do it!

18:50.694 --> 18:53.465
- Bombs too?
- Cheryl.

18:53.499 --> 18:55.303
All right, let's all be cool.

18:55.336 --> 18:56.873
Said the man holding my child

18:56.906 --> 18:58.710
as a human shield.
- Preteen.

18:58.743 --> 19:01.181
This is a babysitter's
worst nightmare.

19:01.214 --> 19:03.319
Yeah, you're definitely
not getting a tip.

19:03.352 --> 19:05.389
No, no, no, no, no,
let's all settle down.

19:05.423 --> 19:07.728
Big Tony, this isn't like you.

19:07.761 --> 19:09.732
I know, it's just,
this didn't go down

19:09.765 --> 19:10.901
like I thought it would,
all right?

19:10.934 --> 19:12.871
So more problems with Angie?

19:12.905 --> 19:16.278
She wants a big wedding, and
all the guests are her friends,

19:16.311 --> 19:17.313
so--

19:19.384 --> 19:20.887
Damn it!

19:20.921 --> 19:24.227
- Is that an Irish jig?
- Dance camp.

19:24.260 --> 19:25.496
Wh--

19:25.530 --> 19:26.933
Damn it, if they kill him,

19:26.966 --> 19:28.636
we wasted a whole Saturday
for nothing.

19:28.670 --> 19:31.609
AJ, honey, I'm so sorry,
but--

19:31.642 --> 19:33.613
Go.
I'll stay with Aunt Pammy.

19:33.646 --> 19:37.387
Sh-she called me Aunt Pammy.
I earned it!

19:37.420 --> 19:38.523
- He went this way.

19:38.556 --> 19:39.959
I'll get my car
and meet you outside.

19:39.992 --> 19:42.698
I'm pretty sure I left it
in the garage last night.

19:42.731 --> 19:45.269
Hmm, but not totally sure.

19:45.302 --> 19:48.643
Sergeant Strawberry!

19:48.676 --> 19:49.812
- Is that a--oh!

19:49.845 --> 19:52.618
Yes, Lana, it's a lance!

19:54.588 --> 19:55.924
That's them up there.

19:55.957 --> 19:58.530
Ugh, could you ride
a little smoother?

19:58.563 --> 20:00.967
Sure, Lana, let me shift
Sergeant Strawberry's gears.

20:08.683 --> 20:09.985
Ugh.

20:10.019 --> 20:11.488
Here, take the reins.

20:13.560 --> 20:15.329
- I'm only saying, Dimitri--

20:16.999 --> 20:20.406
Was that like 20 feet?
That's gotta be a record.

20:20.439 --> 20:21.542
I don't know,
felt closer to ten.

20:21.576 --> 20:22.745
Hey, you have running.

20:22.778 --> 20:24.682
Let me at least have this.

20:27.888 --> 20:31.428
Broker, I'm thrilled
to see you alive.

20:31.461 --> 20:32.865
It's one
of my favorite things to be,

20:32.898 --> 20:35.604
second only to wine tasting
at your vineyard, of course.

20:35.637 --> 20:36.973
How's the harvest?
- Ah.

20:37.006 --> 20:39.344
If the mildew doesn't get
my sauvignons,

20:39.377 --> 20:40.814
the beetles will.

20:40.847 --> 20:42.751
Then we must hurry to get
those grapes in a glass.

20:45.022 --> 20:46.826
Oh, how I've missed you.

20:46.859 --> 20:49.431
- Okay, what's your trick?

20:49.464 --> 20:50.734
And does it work
on daughters?

20:50.767 --> 20:52.571
Instant intimacy?
Well, the trick is,

20:52.604 --> 20:53.773
there is no trick.

20:53.807 --> 20:56.445
I connect
because I genuinely care.

20:56.478 --> 20:59.451
Like how you both care
about your daughter.

20:59.484 --> 21:01.789
See, Lana?
The criminal negotiator

21:01.823 --> 21:03.993
thinks we're good parents.
- Mm, not what he said.

21:04.027 --> 21:05.997
- Wait, where's AJ?
- She's fine.

21:06.031 --> 21:07.601
She wanted to wait
in Grandma's office.

21:10.640 --> 21:12.009
That had better be juice.

21:12.043 --> 21:14.648
Mommy!

21:14.682 --> 21:16.017
AJ, I'm so sorry.

21:16.051 --> 21:17.888
I wanted this to be
your best Saturday ever.

21:17.921 --> 21:19.324
But it was.

21:19.357 --> 21:20.994
I saw your office
and played with Babou

21:21.027 --> 21:22.664
and fired a gun and--
- Pam!

21:22.698 --> 21:24.902
What matters
is we're all safe.

21:24.935 --> 21:28.041
The takeaway here
is she called me Aunt Pammy.

21:28.075 --> 21:30.947
And we all helped babysit,
which deserves compensation.

21:30.981 --> 21:33.352
- You're a multimillionaire.
- But I'm not a chump.

21:33.385 --> 21:34.889
Amen, sister!

21:34.922 --> 21:37.460
- Can we watch cartoons now?
- I would love that.

21:39.932 --> 21:42.604
Oh, God, yeah, it's juice.

21:42.638 --> 21:44.742
Oh, my God, I still taste it.

21:44.775 --> 21:46.344
Someone get me some whiskey.

22:06.619 --> 22:09.558
Made in Georgia.
