<i>- Hey there, have you recently</i>

- Well, yes. Yes, I have.

<i>- Well, then you need</i>

01:52.444 --> 01:53.510

02:04.556 --> 02:05.822
Wait--
<i>- Here!</i>

02:05.824 --> 02:08.525

Okay, thanks.

02:09.328 --> 02:12.762

<i>clumsy, why not buy two?</i>

02:12.764 --> 02:14.898

02:17.202 --> 02:18.869
- Ooh!

02:20.305 --> 02:23.907
- Hey, SpongeBob!
You're in your underwear.

02:23.909 --> 02:25.275
That's cool.

02:25.277 --> 02:26.776
I got your mail.

02:26.778 --> 02:27.611
What is it?

02:28.614 --> 02:32.215
- It's my life insurance.
I got one for you too.

02:32.217 --> 02:34.217
- Oh, boy! Life insurance!

02:34.219 --> 02:35.986
Life insurance!

02:35.988 --> 02:37.220
Life insurance!

02:37.222 --> 02:38.755
Life insurance!

02:38.757 --> 02:40.857
Life insurance!

02:40.859 --> 02:42.859
What's life insurance?

02:42.861 --> 02:44.694
- I'm not sure,
but I think it means

02:44.696 --> 02:48.265
that for the rest of our lives,
we are protected.

02:48.267 --> 02:50.534
We can't get hurt.

02:50.536 --> 02:52.669
- Mm...

02:54.339 --> 02:58.241
The contract tastes legitimate,

02:58.243 --> 02:59.809
but I don't believe it.

02:59.811 --> 03:01.878
- Well, let's try to get hurt,
and we'll see.

03:01.880 --> 03:05.982
- Ha! Well, finally,
something I'm good at.

03:08.587 --> 03:10.854
- Remarkable.

03:11.657 --> 03:13.957
- You can hit me all you want...

03:13.959 --> 03:15.458
- Yet I can't be damaged.

03:15.460 --> 03:17.661
This life insurance
is really working.

03:17.663 --> 03:21.364
I've become unbreakable!

03:24.002 --> 03:26.770
- Why, yes, I do race
sea horses.

03:28.941 --> 03:31.374
Oh, I don't know
if I'd call myself

03:31.376 --> 03:33.843
an <i> international</i> playboy.

03:38.584 --> 03:41.985
- Just what are you two
ignorami doing out here?

03:41.987 --> 03:43.720
- We're trying to hurt
each other.

03:43.722 --> 03:45.789
- Oh!
- Don't--hey--what the--

03:45.791 --> 03:48.358
- You got a sea spider
on your head.

03:48.360 --> 03:50.894
- It's not a sea spider,
you dope.

03:50.896 --> 03:53.396
It's my hair.

03:53.398 --> 03:55.298
Mm...

03:57.836 --> 04:00.870
- Wait a second.
Hurt each other?

04:00.872 --> 04:04.708
Oh, I'm gonna enjoy
seeing this.

04:07.379 --> 04:08.712
Whoa!

04:10.315 --> 04:11.047
- Stop! Stop! Stop!

04:11.049 --> 04:13.783
I thought you said you were
trying to hurt each other.

04:13.785 --> 04:14.818
- Uh-huh, we're trying.

04:14.820 --> 04:16.952
- Well, you're not
gonna do any damage

04:16.954 --> 04:18.822
with soft pillows.

04:18.824 --> 04:21.091
Here, try this.

04:21.093 --> 04:24.494
- Okay.

04:24.496 --> 04:25.962
- Squidward was wrong.

04:25.964 --> 04:29.599
Didn't hurt him,
just made him disappear.

04:33.071 --> 04:34.904
Ah! Sea spider!

04:37.009 --> 04:39.442
Uh!

04:39.444 --> 04:41.911
- Oh--oh, no, Patrick,
I'm slipping...

04:41.913 --> 04:43.980
and falling!

04:45.017 --> 04:47.117
I didn't even break a bone!

04:47.119 --> 04:47.884
- My turn!

04:47.886 --> 04:50.720
I'm losing my footing!

04:50.722 --> 04:51.388
No!

04:51.390 --> 04:54.991
I survived a deadly fall unhurt!

04:54.993 --> 04:56.660
- Life insurance.

04:56.662 --> 04:59.129
- Hi-ya! Hi-ya!

04:59.131 --> 05:02.599
- What?
I can't hear you!

05:02.601 --> 05:03.133
- Hi-ya!

05:03.135 --> 05:08.471
- Turn the volume up
inside of your voice!

05:08.473 --> 05:10.707
- I said--

05:11.910 --> 05:14.077
- Squidward,
what were you yelling?

05:14.079 --> 05:15.612
- I was trying to say

05:15.614 --> 05:19.883
you got to fall
from something higher.

05:19.885 --> 05:20.850
- Sea spider!

05:29.494 --> 05:31.761
Ah! My baby.

05:32.831 --> 05:35.732
- Once again, I'm asking,

05:35.734 --> 05:37.934
what are you doing?
- It's our final test.

05:37.936 --> 05:39.936
We're trying to get
jellyfish to sting us

05:39.938 --> 05:42.105
to prove we can't get hurt.

05:42.107 --> 05:43.506
- What?

05:46.445 --> 05:48.111
- Oh! Me! Me!
Sting me! Over here!

05:48.113 --> 05:50.880
- Sting me, sting me, sting me.
- Blast me with your venom!

05:50.882 --> 05:52.782
- Zap me with your pain juice!

05:52.784 --> 05:54.651
- Sting me, please!
- Sting me, sting me, sting me.

05:54.653 --> 05:56.686
- You're the ones asking--

05:58.590 --> 06:02.425
- Gee, Squidward, maybe you
should get some life insurance.

06:02.427 --> 06:05.028
- What are you yammering about?

06:05.030 --> 06:07.931
- I bought some life insurance
for Patrick and myself,

06:07.933 --> 06:09.899
and now we can never be hurt.

06:09.901 --> 06:12.869
- Yeah.
To test out the life insurance,

06:12.871 --> 06:17.140
we even built a super dangerous
obstacle course

06:17.142 --> 06:18.208
across the street.

06:18.210 --> 06:20.844
- We call it The Sushi Maker.

06:21.880 --> 06:23.947
Squidward, I think
you need this more than I.

06:23.949 --> 06:28.952
I would like to present you
with my life insurance policy.

06:28.954 --> 06:31.721
- Actually, you better take two,

06:31.723 --> 06:33.556
since you're kind of a klutz.

06:34.459 --> 06:36.960
- Better take two?
Life insurance?

06:36.962 --> 06:38.461
You giblet heads!

06:38.463 --> 06:42.165
No piece of paper can protect
a person from getting hurt.

06:44.002 --> 06:45.535
- Yay! It works!

06:45.537 --> 06:46.803
- You're untouchable!

06:46.805 --> 06:49.873
- Oh, that was a coincidence.

06:49.875 --> 06:51.808
- Driving's hard.

06:58.784 --> 07:00.850
Yay! Life insurance!

07:00.852 --> 07:02.819
- You are
magically protected.

07:02.821 --> 07:04.521
-Whoo-hoo!
- Whoo!

07:04.523 --> 07:07.023
- Oh, it was luck!
Dumb luck!

07:07.993 --> 07:11.127
Look, I'll prove it.
You stand here.

07:13.899 --> 07:14.831
- Huh? Hmm? Oh.

07:14.833 --> 07:16.733
- You see, Squidward?
You're immune!

07:16.735 --> 07:18.568
- You can't be hurt!
- Yeah!

07:18.570 --> 07:21.171
- You are a cast-iron
Squidward.

07:21.173 --> 07:24.207
Life insurance!
Life insurance!

07:24.209 --> 07:25.542
- Wow, I can't believe it,

07:25.544 --> 07:28.678
but you two sub-geniuses
were right somehow.

07:28.680 --> 07:32.816
I can't be broken.
I'm indestructible!

07:32.818 --> 07:35.218
I am shatterproof!

07:35.220 --> 07:37.253
Watch this.

07:40.659 --> 07:41.758
- What you gonna do,
Squidward?

07:41.760 --> 07:42.859
- What does it look like?

07:42.861 --> 07:44.160
I'm running into a...

07:44.162 --> 07:46.296
Wall!

07:49.234 --> 07:51.568
Yes.
That's just what it needed.

07:51.570 --> 07:54.804
I'll call the painting
"One Hole."

07:54.806 --> 07:56.039
Oh, it's genius!

07:57.642 --> 08:00.109
Ugh! Three holes?

08:00.111 --> 08:02.145
That makes no sense!

08:02.947 --> 08:03.813
- Did you see that?

08:03.815 --> 08:05.849
I ran right through
a brick wall.

08:05.851 --> 08:07.684
I'm hard as nails!

08:07.686 --> 08:11.087
Come on, world!
Bring it on!

08:11.089 --> 08:14.757
- Hmm.

08:16.026 --> 08:17.927
- Oh, perfect.

08:19.231 --> 08:22.165
- Pfft. Big tough guy.

08:22.167 --> 08:24.000
- What are you doing,
Squidward?

08:24.002 --> 08:25.301
- Just watch.

08:27.105 --> 08:30.173
- Enjoying your sherbert,
Herbert?

08:30.175 --> 08:32.107
- My name's not Herbert.

08:32.110 --> 08:33.676
- Oh, I know it's not.

08:33.678 --> 08:37.246
Your name is "Hey."
What's your name?

08:37.249 --> 08:38.581
- Hey!

08:38.582 --> 08:41.251
- Told ya!
Here, let me help you.

08:44.789 --> 08:47.023
- Funny, didn't feel a thing.

08:47.025 --> 08:48.925
- Uh, Squidward, I don't think
you should lick that.

08:48.927 --> 08:52.862
It's got germs.
- Ha! Germs can't hurt me.

08:52.864 --> 08:55.331
Nothing can hurt me!

09:00.705 --> 09:01.437
As a matter of fact,

09:01.439 --> 09:02.839
do you know
what I'm gonna do now?

09:02.841 --> 09:06.776
I'm gonna run your
super dangerous obstacle course.

09:06.778 --> 09:08.845
You know why?

09:08.847 --> 09:09.846
- Mm-mm.
- No.

09:09.848 --> 09:14.017
- Because now I've got moxie!

09:15.186 --> 09:17.987
Wait, what's moxie?

09:32.737 --> 09:33.870
- What goes on, boyos?

09:33.872 --> 09:36.072
- Squidward is gonna try out
The Sushi Maker.

09:36.074 --> 09:39.008
- Why does he want to do that?
- Oh, don't worry, Mr. Krabs.

09:39.010 --> 09:42.679
He's got life insurance.
He can't be hurt.

09:42.681 --> 09:45.715
- That's not how
life insurance works.

09:45.717 --> 09:47.750
- It's not?
- Course not!

09:47.752 --> 09:50.253
Life insurance is money
the beneficiary gets

09:50.255 --> 09:51.754
when a person dies.

09:51.756 --> 09:53.756
By the way, who gets the money?

09:53.758 --> 09:54.824
- Well, let's see.

09:58.662 --> 10:00.997
No name here.
- Hooray!

10:00.999 --> 10:01.798
Hmm.

10:02.467 --> 10:05.935
Eugene H. Krabs.

10:05.937 --> 10:07.704
Go, Squidward!

10:07.706 --> 10:08.404
Yay!

10:08.406 --> 10:10.340
Fly high! Do or die!

10:10.342 --> 10:13.376
Preferably the latter.

10:13.378 --> 10:15.945
- D-d-d-d-do or die?

10:15.947 --> 10:17.213
Squidward, come down!

10:17.215 --> 10:18.214
You're not invincible!

10:18.216 --> 10:19.983
Life insurance
is not what you think!

10:19.985 --> 10:23.119
You were right!
Oh, it was just dumb luck.

10:23.121 --> 10:24.253
- Now I'm yelling too!

10:24.255 --> 10:27.790
- Oh, what are those ninnies
going on about now?

10:27.792 --> 10:29.392
I can't hear you!

10:29.394 --> 10:33.262
Just shut up and watch me.

10:33.264 --> 10:34.964
Nah--hey!

10:34.966 --> 10:37.333
- Come back, Squidward!
Don't do this!

10:37.335 --> 10:40.036
- Will you stop shaking it?

10:51.883 --> 10:53.049
No, no, no, no, no!

11:05.497 --> 11:08.097
Ow...
Eeh! Eeh! Eeh!

11:20.745 --> 11:21.310
Ow...

11:21.312 --> 11:23.112
- Hey, Squidward,
guess what I learned today.

11:23.114 --> 11:24.981
Apparently,
a life insurance policy

11:24.983 --> 11:26.382
doesn't protect
a person from injury.

11:26.384 --> 11:31.854
Heh, how about that?
- Ha, how 'bout that?

11:33.024 --> 11:38.528
- Squidward, how did you survive
The Sushi Maker?

11:40.498 --> 11:42.165
It had to be this.

11:42.167 --> 11:44.500
- Ah!
Sea spider!

12:02.587 --> 12:03.920
- Look out! Oh!

12:09.226 --> 12:10.393
- Learn how to drive!

12:10.395 --> 12:14.397
- I'm trying!
- Calm down, SpongeBob.

12:14.399 --> 12:16.332
- Yes, Mrs. Puff.

12:16.968 --> 12:18.634
Nothing soothes
one's frazzled nerves

12:18.636 --> 12:19.702
like blowing bubbles!

12:21.940 --> 12:24.340
- No blowing bubbles
while driving!

12:29.012 --> 12:30.313
- Phew.

12:32.383 --> 12:35.251
Whoa!

12:36.120 --> 12:39.422
- I can't feel my big toe.

12:39.424 --> 12:41.457
- So, uh, how'd I do?

12:41.459 --> 12:42.458
- Get out!

12:42.460 --> 12:45.628
You're never getting
a boating license.

12:48.600 --> 12:53.102
But--but--
- Never! Never!

12:56.074 --> 12:58.474
I'll never pass
my driver's test,

12:58.476 --> 12:59.542
I'll never get my license,

12:59.544 --> 13:02.612
and I'll never know the joys
of boat ownership!

13:02.614 --> 13:05.314
- Ooh...
- It's really nice.

13:05.316 --> 13:07.717
- Oh, yeah, it's a turbo jet.

13:07.719 --> 13:12.388
390 sea horse power
with 11-to-1 pop-up piston.

13:13.358 --> 13:16.325
We're talking
some serious muscle!

13:18.596 --> 13:22.632
- I love your boat, Larry!

13:37.348 --> 13:39.415
Oh, hey there, boyo!

13:39.417 --> 13:43.219
Lovely day for a boat wash.

13:43.221 --> 13:45.588
Isn't it?

13:48.693 --> 13:49.292
- Whoa.

13:49.294 --> 13:52.628
Maybe I shouldn't have
borrowed Pearl's shorts.

13:55.500 --> 13:58.801
Hey, Patrick,
you want to hang out?

13:58.803 --> 14:00.403
- Wish I could, SpongeBob,

14:00.405 --> 14:05.174
but I'm kind of spending time
with my boat right now.

14:05.176 --> 14:06.142
- Your boat.

14:06.144 --> 14:08.511
Sure, Patrick.
See you later.

14:12.217 --> 14:14.250
Catch!

14:22.126 --> 14:25.361
- You're a very good driver,
SpongeBob,

14:25.363 --> 14:28.130
and my favorite student.

14:28.132 --> 14:31.701
Here's your license.

14:33.738 --> 14:35.371
- Ooh!

14:35.373 --> 14:36.339
Aww!

14:36.341 --> 14:41.310
If only I was as good at driving
as I am at blowing bubbles.

14:42.247 --> 14:46.082
Oh! That's it!

14:48.385 --> 14:51.487
- Whoa.
- What is that?

14:56.494 --> 15:00.196
Oh!
- All right, all right.

15:09.507 --> 15:11.207
Pleasant day for a drive,
hey, Officer?

15:11.209 --> 15:16.445
- Sir, I'm going to need to see
your license for that, um...

15:16.447 --> 15:20.816
- You don't need
a license to drive a bubble.

15:20.818 --> 15:23.419
- Hmm, I suppose you're right.

15:23.421 --> 15:24.754
Carry on, citizen.

15:33.598 --> 15:34.797
- Gary!

15:34.799 --> 15:36.132
- You'll never believe it.

15:36.134 --> 15:37.900
I was out driving all day.

15:37.902 --> 15:38.701
Yes, driving!

15:38.703 --> 15:40.369
First I drove down
the street like this!

15:42.540 --> 15:44.206
Then I made a right turn
on red like this.

15:47.845 --> 15:49.245
You should've been there, Gary.

15:49.247 --> 15:51.147
Oh, it was like
a dream come true.

15:53.818 --> 15:56.485
- Hmm?

15:56.487 --> 15:59.922
- I'm here for a bubble boat.
- Yeah, me too!

15:59.924 --> 16:01.590
- I want one!
- Uh, yeah, yeah, me too.

16:01.592 --> 16:03.392
- Yes, please.
- One, please.

16:03.394 --> 16:04.927
- Oh, I'm not sure
I have enough soap

16:04.929 --> 16:07.196
to make this many
bubble boats.

16:07.198 --> 16:08.798
- Please?

16:08.800 --> 16:13.836
- Well, I suppose I could tap
into my rainy day reserves.

16:17.275 --> 16:19.475
Gah.
Gah!

16:24.815 --> 16:27.750
- One bubble boat coming up!

16:30.388 --> 16:31.821
- Thank you!

16:33.224 --> 16:34.457
- Down here, idiot!

16:34.459 --> 16:38.227
I want to strike fear
in the hearts of other drivers.

16:38.229 --> 16:42.898
You got something terrifying
in that wand for me, SpongeBob?

16:42.900 --> 16:44.834
- I sure do, Plankton!

16:49.474 --> 16:52.975
- Oof!

16:56.514 --> 17:01.684
Ha-ha-ha, you fool!
Now I will rule the streets!

17:02.987 --> 17:04.387
Ouch!

17:06.257 --> 17:09.358
Strike fear...

17:09.359 --> 17:14.696
- Hmm...blow me something
that screams Larry, SpongeBob.

17:14.699 --> 17:16.999
- I'm on it, Larry!

17:22.339 --> 17:26.642
- Now, this is what I call
a muscle car!

17:28.279 --> 17:30.012
- I love your boat, Larry!

17:38.156 --> 17:40.256
I'll never blow
enough bubble boats

17:40.258 --> 17:41.791
at this rate.

17:41.793 --> 17:43.559
Yahoo!

17:52.736 --> 17:56.605
Greetings, class.

17:56.607 --> 17:58.874
My name is--

17:58.876 --> 18:03.345
Mrs. Puff.

18:03.347 --> 18:06.415
Oh, now that everyone's
driving bubbles,

18:06.417 --> 18:08.951
they don't need licenses.

18:09.687 --> 18:12.688
I guess there's just
no place in this world

18:12.690 --> 18:17.493
for an old driving instructor.

18:20.998 --> 18:21.931
Oh!

18:21.933 --> 18:23.666
Bah!
- Hey, watch it, lady!

18:23.668 --> 18:25.835
- Ah!
- I'm driving over here!

18:25.837 --> 18:27.703
- Hey, hey, hey, hey!
- Oh--wah!

18:27.705 --> 18:30.573
- Hey! pick a lane,
butter-brain!

18:37.615 --> 18:40.983
- I'm going to have to ask you
to step out of the boat, ma'am.

18:40.985 --> 18:42.618
Do you know why
I pulled you over?

18:42.620 --> 18:45.788
- You ran my plates
and saw my rap sheet?

18:45.790 --> 18:46.555
- What? No.

18:46.557 --> 18:49.391
Your vehicle
has been outlawed, ma'am.

18:50.495 --> 18:51.794
Now that everyone drives
bubble boats,

18:51.796 --> 18:54.697
real boats have been deemed
too sharp and pointy

18:54.699 --> 18:55.931
to be street legal.

18:55.933 --> 18:59.635
- But I've never
driven a bubble.

19:01.371 --> 19:04.373
Bubble boating school?

19:04.574 --> 19:06.775
Please don't be SpongeBob.
Please don't be SpongeBob.

19:06.777 --> 19:10.112
Please don't be SpongeBob.
Please don't be SpongeBob.

19:10.114 --> 19:12.114
Please don't be SpongeBob.

19:12.116 --> 19:14.483
- Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

19:15.786 --> 19:17.786
Hi, Mrs. Puff.
- Of course.

19:17.788 --> 19:19.989
- You must be here
for the bubble lessons.

19:19.991 --> 19:22.424
Don't worry, Mrs. P.

19:22.426 --> 19:24.827
You'll be learning
from a master.

19:28.632 --> 19:31.033
Whoa!

19:34.005 --> 19:35.604
- Great.

19:35.939 --> 19:39.742
- Now, to get your bubble going,
just pump your legs like this.

19:45.383 --> 19:46.916
- Oh! Ooh!

19:46.918 --> 19:50.553
Oh!
- Nice start.

20:07.538 --> 20:09.838
Oh!

20:09.840 --> 20:12.775
Fire!

20:27.925 --> 20:29.491
Oh! Ah!

20:29.493 --> 20:33.095
Hmm. Hah. Eeh.

20:33.097 --> 20:34.563
I did it.

20:34.565 --> 20:36.699
- Mrs. Puff,
you're ready.

20:36.701 --> 20:38.734
- Really?
- Absolutely!

20:38.736 --> 20:41.503
You just need to pass
your final test...

20:41.505 --> 20:42.605
out there.

20:44.041 --> 20:46.108
Oh.

20:48.713 --> 20:52.748
- Nice and easy.
Doing great.

20:53.883 --> 20:55.217
- Hello!

20:55.785 --> 20:59.021
- You know, this whole
bubble boating thing

20:59.023 --> 21:00.189
isn't so bad.

21:00.191 --> 21:01.924
Maybe I could--

21:01.926 --> 21:03.525
- Oh, no, Mrs. Puff!

21:03.527 --> 21:06.161
You got on the freeway
by mistake!

21:06.163 --> 21:07.196
Look out!

21:08.032 --> 21:11.533
- It's okay! Just calm down!

21:11.535 --> 21:15.104
- Eeh! Oh!

21:21.712 --> 21:23.245
- Ah! Ah!

21:23.247 --> 21:25.781
Ah!

21:25.783 --> 21:28.017
- Oh!

21:29.787 --> 21:31.920
- Oh!

21:33.491 --> 21:35.924
Ah!

21:38.496 --> 21:42.197
- Oh, no. What's gonna happen
when they hit the surface?

22:02.620 --> 22:03.285
- Oh!

22:03.287 --> 22:06.221
- Doh!

22:07.625 --> 22:08.657
- No more bubbles.

22:08.659 --> 22:09.325
Get them off me!

22:09.327 --> 22:10.726
- Don't worry, Mrs. Puff.

22:10.728 --> 22:11.627
Even though it was bubbles

22:11.629 --> 22:12.895
that caused
all these problems,

22:12.897 --> 22:15.130
it was also bubbles
that solved 'em.

22:15.132 --> 22:17.666
That's kind of a wash, I guess.

22:17.668 --> 22:18.600
Get it? Wash?

22:18.602 --> 22:20.703
Soap? Bubbles?

22:20.705 --> 22:23.672
- Give me that.
Bubble boats are too unstable.

22:23.674 --> 22:25.874
They've been declared
illegal.

22:25.876 --> 22:28.677
Everyone back
to your regular boats!

22:31.048 --> 22:33.582
- Well, Mrs. Puff,
looks like I have to get

22:33.584 --> 22:35.284
my boating license after all.

22:35.286 --> 22:36.318
See you tomorrow in class!

22:36.320 --> 22:39.621
♪ La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la,
la-la-la-la ♪

22:39.623 --> 22:42.791
