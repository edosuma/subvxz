any energy in the room?

00:09.409 --> 00:10.877
- No, I just feel
like it's pretty positive vibes

00:10.877 --> 00:13.346
in this room.
- Positive vibes only.

- She's good.

00:22.188 --> 00:23.990

dating your Vinny

00:23.990 --> 00:25.392
while you were
trying to figure out

00:25.392 --> 00:26.726
your feelings for our Vinny?

00:26.726 --> 00:28.061
- Most likely.

00:28.061 --> 00:29.396
- I wasn't dating him
full-blown like that.

00:29.396 --> 00:31.498
- He was just living
in the house, you know.

00:31.498 --> 00:32.866
<i>- And tonight...</i>

00:32.866 --> 00:34.501

Angelina,

00:34.501 --> 00:35.769
you just can't be happy.

00:35.769 --> 00:37.170
- I would have liked
for you to be happy.

00:37.170 --> 00:39.439
- Can I [bleep] finish?
- He was not backed up.

00:39.439 --> 00:42.075
I definitely took care of him.
- [laughs]

00:42.075 --> 00:43.476
- I just broke my vagina.

00:43.476 --> 00:45.412
How are we supposed
to do regular sex?

00:45.412 --> 00:46.913
- [laughs]

00:46.913 --> 00:48.314
- You know you're wrong
with the felony thing, though.

00:48.314 --> 00:50.483
- I was doing a dig at you.
I was.

00:50.483 --> 00:52.652
- I'm sick and tired
of you acting like my mother.

00:52.652 --> 00:54.254
You're not my [bleep] mom.
- Oh!

00:54.254 --> 00:55.922
- How many times
have I stuck up for you?

00:55.922 --> 00:58.124
- Don't [bleep] raise
your [bleep] voice to me.

00:58.124 --> 00:59.292

01:03.229 --> 01:06.065
- Angelina, everybody
seemed equally shocked

01:06.065 --> 01:07.500
by the proposal.

01:07.500 --> 01:09.936
Why did you feel like Jenni
was less happy for you

01:09.936 --> 01:11.438
than everyone else?

01:11.438 --> 01:13.339
- I mean, it felt like,
at that point,

01:13.339 --> 01:16.075
between you and I, like,
we were, like, moving forward

01:16.075 --> 01:18.077
with our relationship,
and just the questioning

01:18.077 --> 01:19.779
was just a little just weird,

01:19.779 --> 01:22.015
and it just wasn't called for.

01:22.015 --> 01:25.018
- Have you even introduced him
to social media yet?

01:25.018 --> 01:26.419
When did you move in?

01:26.419 --> 01:27.921
How long have you had the ring?
I have to know.

01:27.921 --> 01:30.190
- I would have never asked
questions like that when I--

01:30.190 --> 01:32.792
when somebody that I knew
and I was happy for

01:32.792 --> 01:34.594
got engaged.

01:34.594 --> 01:36.095
- I just don't think
you've ever had

01:36.095 --> 01:38.264
a real girlfriend
to know what girlfriends do

01:38.264 --> 01:39.799
with each other.

01:39.799 --> 01:41.901
- It was just like, even Zack
asking me questions,

01:41.901 --> 01:43.736
like, "Wait, when did
you guys meet each other?"

01:43.736 --> 01:45.538
It was just hater [bleep].

01:45.538 --> 01:48.408
- So, Jenni, you looked happy
during the proposal.

01:48.408 --> 01:49.742
- I was.
- Were you?

01:49.742 --> 01:50.944
- I was.

01:50.944 --> 01:53.680
I've also asked Chris,
like, when did he

01:53.680 --> 01:55.882
decide to propose to Deena?

01:55.882 --> 01:57.684
When did he decide
to get the ring?

01:57.684 --> 01:58.818
Same with Gianni.

01:58.818 --> 02:00.153
- She asked,
"When did you know?"

02:00.153 --> 02:02.088
- When did you know?
- But that's different.

02:02.088 --> 02:03.289
But that's different.

02:03.289 --> 02:04.791
That's not
what they were asking me.

02:04.791 --> 02:06.593
Like, they weren't
asking me that.

02:06.593 --> 02:09.429
- When you meet someone
for 24 hours

02:09.429 --> 02:10.797
and then they propose,

02:10.797 --> 02:12.465
it's kind of like
a crash course.

02:12.465 --> 02:14.267
Like, I really want
to get to know you.

02:14.267 --> 02:16.369
Like, I found it to be

02:16.369 --> 02:19.739
very girl-like questions

02:19.739 --> 02:23.476
that I would do
with any of my girlfriends.

02:23.476 --> 02:24.878
- And Jenni is also very nosy.

02:24.878 --> 02:26.279
So she just likes
to know all the details.

02:26.279 --> 02:27.280
- Yeah.
- I know.

02:27.280 --> 02:28.281
But that's just--I just--

02:28.281 --> 02:29.582
Jenni, I'm sorry.

02:29.582 --> 02:31.317
Like, I'm literally here,
like, just saying what--

02:31.317 --> 02:33.453
like, when you see something,
you say something,

02:33.453 --> 02:34.821
and I saw something,

02:34.821 --> 02:36.189
and I just didn't think
you were happy for me.

02:36.189 --> 02:37.457
- Why didn't you say it
in the moment?

02:37.457 --> 02:38.791
- Yeah.

02:38.791 --> 02:39.959
- If you say, like,
if you see something--

02:39.959 --> 02:41.427
if I see something,
I say something--

02:41.427 --> 02:42.662
- Because why am I gonna--
why am I gonna sit there--

02:42.662 --> 02:44.097
I'm already
answering questions.

02:44.097 --> 02:46.132
So I felt like instead of me
enjoying my engagement

02:46.132 --> 02:48.301
when I just sat my ass down
on the seat,

02:48.301 --> 02:49.936
I was too busy, like--

02:49.936 --> 02:52.005
like, actually proving myself

02:52.005 --> 02:53.473
that I knew him
for more than a week.

02:53.473 --> 02:55.141
- And I just truly believe
you don't have

02:55.141 --> 02:57.744
a track record with, like,
good girlfriends in your life.

02:57.744 --> 02:59.112
So you think everyone's...
- That's not true.

02:59.112 --> 03:00.713
- Coming from a negative...
- That's not true.

03:00.713 --> 03:03.016
- Place,
and I actually was coming

03:03.016 --> 03:06.152
from a genuine place
as a girlfriend

03:06.152 --> 03:07.420
just trying to know.

03:07.420 --> 03:08.888
- The way you had asked it,
I was just--

03:08.888 --> 03:09.989
- Hold on.

03:09.989 --> 03:11.391
This is between--
I know, Deena.

03:11.391 --> 03:12.892
But you also got involved.
You both got involved.

03:12.892 --> 03:14.127
- I got involved
because it always--

03:14.127 --> 03:15.395
we're always gonna be involved,
Angelina.

03:15.395 --> 03:16.529
- Because we're girlfriends.
- OK, but--but--

03:16.529 --> 03:17.964
- This is how
this family works.

03:17.964 --> 03:19.332
Everyone always gets involved.
- But it doesn't matter.

03:19.332 --> 03:20.800
This is between Jenni and I.
- They were there.

03:20.800 --> 03:21.901
- You guys will always want
to sit there and say...

03:21.901 --> 03:23.236
<i>- With what?</i>

03:23.236 --> 03:24.771
- Why the [bleep], like,
am I involved in drama?

03:24.771 --> 03:26.039
You [bleep] put yourself in it.
- Yeah, because I was--

03:26.039 --> 03:27.273
- You put yourself in it.

03:27.273 --> 03:28.341
- I was sticking up
for her at the end

03:28.341 --> 03:29.943
because that was [bleep] nuts.

03:29.943 --> 03:31.377
- You always stick up for her.
It's the same [bleep] [bleep].

03:31.377 --> 03:32.612
It doesn't even matter
at this point.

03:32.612 --> 03:33.913
- I was sticking up
for her at the end

03:33.913 --> 03:35.415
because I sat across from her.
And yeah...

03:35.415 --> 03:36.549
- Who the [bleep]--are you ever
gonna stick up for me?

03:36.549 --> 03:37.617
- That was [bleep]--

03:37.617 --> 03:38.751
- You're gonna stick up
for her?

03:38.751 --> 03:40.086
- How many times
have I stuck up for you?

03:40.086 --> 03:41.087
- Don't [bleep] raise
your [bleep] voice to me.

03:41.087 --> 03:42.422
- Oh, God.

03:42.422 --> 03:43.590
- Don't [bleep] raise
your [bleep] voice to me.

03:43.590 --> 03:45.058
- Come hit me, baby.
- Sit down.

03:45.058 --> 03:46.392
- I'm not gonna hit you,
because I'm classier.

03:46.392 --> 03:47.627
But don't [bleep]
raise your voice.

03:47.627 --> 03:48.962
- Oh, you're classier?
- Sit, babe, sit.

03:48.962 --> 03:50.163
- And you're standing up
like a [bleep] maniac.

03:50.163 --> 03:51.130
- Don't [bleep] raise
your voice to me.

03:51.130 --> 03:52.632
- You guys are all family.

03:52.632 --> 03:54.100
All right, Ange, sit.
- You are [bleep]--

03:54.100 --> 03:55.768
You guys inserted yourselves,
and that's what the--

03:55.768 --> 03:57.103
and you want
to play the victim card.

03:57.103 --> 03:58.538
- I'm not playing
the victim card.

03:58.538 --> 03:59.706
- No one is playing the
victim card but you!

03:59.706 --> 04:01.040
- All right, guys,
listen, listen,

04:01.040 --> 04:02.208
listen, listen, listen.
- That's all you do.

04:02.208 --> 04:03.676
- That's all I am
is a victim player?

04:03.676 --> 04:04.911
OK, OK, your highness.

04:04.911 --> 04:05.979
- All right, guys, listen.
- Sit down.

04:05.979 --> 04:07.347
- Everyone's family here.

04:07.347 --> 04:08.381
So let's not--you know.
- You want to hit me?

04:08.381 --> 04:09.549
- Get the [bleep] out of here.

04:09.549 --> 04:10.683
- You love playing
the poor-me card.

04:10.683 --> 04:11.918
- Oh, OK.

04:11.918 --> 04:12.952
- Let's not get too crazy.
- I'm wrong.

04:12.952 --> 04:14.554
You're right.
I know.

04:14.554 --> 04:15.822
- You've been--
you've been waiting for this.

04:15.822 --> 04:17.290
- Are you seven?
- No, I haven't been.

04:17.290 --> 04:18.625
- You've been, like,
[bleep], like, just so excited.

04:18.625 --> 04:19.859
- Why did you just have
to open your mouth?

04:19.859 --> 04:21.327
I'm having a conversation.
- Are you seven?

04:21.327 --> 04:22.729
- Let's keep it moving
because at the end of the day,

04:22.729 --> 04:23.930
everyone is family.
- My God, why'd you do that?

04:23.930 --> 04:25.131
You said that
when I threw you a glass.

04:25.131 --> 04:25.932
- What were you gonna do,
hit me, Angelina?

04:25.932 --> 04:27.066
- I would never hit you.

04:27.066 --> 04:28.534
- Then why
the [bleep] did you...

04:28.534 --> 04:29.602
- You want to raise your voice?
- Get up like that?

04:29.602 --> 04:30.903
That was [bleep] crazy.

04:30.903 --> 04:32.205
- I would never hit you,
because I'm not trash,

04:32.205 --> 04:33.439
but the [bleep] fact is,
is that you were giving--

04:33.439 --> 04:35.141
you were [bleep] going in.
- OK, guys.

04:35.141 --> 04:36.709
- OK, I'm sorry.
- Let's keep it moving.

04:36.709 --> 04:38.077
- Why would--
I'm gonna hit you?

04:38.077 --> 04:39.746
- I don't know why
you would get up like that.

04:39.746 --> 04:40.947
- Because don't [bleep]
raise your voice to me.

04:40.947 --> 04:42.382
- Oh, OK.

04:42.382 --> 04:43.549
- I'm sick and tired
of you acting like my mother.

04:43.549 --> 04:45.051
You're not my [bleep] mom.
- Oh, OK.

04:47.420 --> 04:48.655
- What the [bleep]?
- Moving to 10?

04:48.655 --> 04:49.956
- I'm talking to Jenni.

04:49.956 --> 04:51.324
Why did you have--
you got involved again.

04:51.324 --> 04:52.692
- Because they were there.
- I told you not to.

04:52.692 --> 04:53.793
No, it doesn't matter.
It's between you and I.

04:53.793 --> 04:55.228
- No, it's not.
- Yeah, it is.

04:55.228 --> 04:56.596
- You're so [bleep] delusional,
Angelina.

04:56.596 --> 04:57.730
You think it's
between you and I.

04:57.730 --> 04:59.065
- I know.
Here it is.

04:59.065 --> 05:00.366
I'm delusional.
- It's not between anybody.

05:00.366 --> 05:02.268
You just pick people
to [bleep] go against.

05:02.268 --> 05:04.404
- I pick people.
- I was happy for you.

05:04.404 --> 05:07.206
I let my guard down for her,

05:07.206 --> 05:09.242
and she knew it,

05:09.242 --> 05:12.145
and she probably thought
that this should be, like,

05:12.145 --> 05:14.247
a seasonal-ending banger.

05:14.247 --> 05:15.682
- That's a lie.
- And like--

05:15.682 --> 05:17.016
- Why the [bleep]
would I even want that?

05:17.016 --> 05:19.419
- Because then
the other option is, Angelina,

05:19.419 --> 05:21.020
you just can't be happy.

05:21.020 --> 05:22.422
You cannot be truly happy
for yourself.

05:22.422 --> 05:24.090
- Well, I would have liked
for you to be happy.

05:24.090 --> 05:25.625
- Can I [bleep] finish?
- No.

05:25.625 --> 05:26.893
- Goddamn it.
- Can I [bleep] talk?

05:26.893 --> 05:28.261
Because it's about me
and you right now.

05:28.261 --> 05:29.595
- Then [bleep] go ahead
because I'm gonna be--

05:29.595 --> 05:31.631
- I didn't like the fact
that your man and you--

05:31.631 --> 05:33.166
you guys had
a five-month difference...

05:33.166 --> 05:34.400
- Really?
- When he proposed to you.

05:34.400 --> 05:36.469
Yes!
- Two years, he waited.

05:36.469 --> 05:37.804
- He did not wait two years.

05:37.804 --> 05:40.973
- He proposed on my birthday
two years later.

05:40.973 --> 05:42.375
- All right, we're not gonna
solve this today, obviously.

05:42.375 --> 05:43.543
- Anyways.

05:43.543 --> 05:44.477
- Let's--
let's keep it moving, guys.

05:44.477 --> 05:45.478
- Yeah.
- For sure.

05:45.478 --> 05:46.646
- I got kids to go home to.

05:46.646 --> 05:47.613
- Why are you always
defending her?

05:47.613 --> 05:49.048
- I'm not only defending her.

05:49.048 --> 05:50.850
Angelina, there's been times
that I have defended you.

05:50.850 --> 05:52.318
- Come on, now.
- Oh, no?

05:52.318 --> 05:53.486
You delete those.
- When?

05:53.486 --> 05:54.587
- You delete those.

05:54.587 --> 05:55.955
- She acts
like I don't defend her.

05:55.955 --> 05:57.256
- The night--the night
that Pauly and Nikki...

05:57.256 --> 05:58.758
- Give me an example.
If you defended me--

05:58.758 --> 06:00.093
<i>- OK,
everybody else left you.</i>

06:00.093 --> 06:01.594
<i>Who stayed there?
Who stayed there?</i>

06:01.594 --> 06:03.463
<i>Because I didn't want you
left alone by yourself.</i>

06:03.463 --> 06:05.631
- But that's not defending me.
- But I was there for you.

06:05.631 --> 06:06.833
- I was happy about that.
Thank you.

06:06.833 --> 06:08.201
- See, you are
just one or the other.

06:08.201 --> 06:09.268
- But I'm not talking
about that.

06:09.268 --> 06:10.570
I'm talking about
towards Jenni.

06:10.570 --> 06:11.804
When me and Jenni
have a problem...

06:11.804 --> 06:13.239
- Because this is the thing,
Angelina--

06:13.239 --> 06:14.440
- You stopped liking my
[bleep]. You don't think--

06:14.440 --> 06:16.008
- I don't stop liking
your [bleep].

06:16.008 --> 06:17.343
No, because me and you are...
- You stopped answering me.

06:17.343 --> 06:18.811
- In our own little thing.
- What do we have?

06:18.811 --> 06:20.313
- You were like, "Stop getting
in the middle of it."

06:20.313 --> 06:21.681
- Who cares?
- You know what, Angelina?

06:21.681 --> 06:23.316
- I'm allowed to say that.
I'm allowed to say that.

06:23.316 --> 06:24.951
- OK, so I'm not allowed
to speak my mind?

06:24.951 --> 06:26.586
- But you were getting involved
in our drama, in our [bleep].

06:26.586 --> 06:27.687
- It wasn't getting involved.

06:27.687 --> 06:29.288
This is the thing.
- Or what I saw.

06:29.288 --> 06:30.590
- Let me speak.
- Let her speak.

06:30.590 --> 06:31.991
- OK, go.
- This is the thing.

06:31.991 --> 06:33.626
When it becomes you two,
I'm always

06:33.626 --> 06:35.061
in the [bleep] middle, always.

06:35.061 --> 06:36.095
- I don't want you
in the middle.

06:36.095 --> 06:37.463
- But I always am.
- Why?

06:37.463 --> 06:39.398
- I'm either--it's either
I have to take her side,

06:39.398 --> 06:41.901
or--or you're like,
"You're not friends with me."

06:41.901 --> 06:43.636
No, I don't want this anymore.

06:43.636 --> 06:45.905
We came so far,
as Mike would say,

06:45.905 --> 06:47.240
to come so far.

06:47.240 --> 06:49.242
So for me, I was frustrated.

06:49.242 --> 06:51.611
And now here we go,
backpedaling

06:51.611 --> 06:53.279
a million [bleep] times.

06:53.279 --> 06:55.348
And me and Nicole are gonna be
back in the middle again.

06:55.348 --> 06:57.483
So yeah, I am annoyed.

06:57.483 --> 06:59.619
- All right, ladies, we know
there's a lot of love here,

06:59.619 --> 07:01.087
and you guys are gonna
get through this.

07:01.087 --> 07:03.389
It doesn't seem like
it's gonna get settled tonight,

07:03.389 --> 07:05.424
so let's just dead
the convo right here.

07:05.424 --> 07:07.727
- What was that?

07:07.727 --> 07:09.095
- I mean, we obviously,
definitely

07:09.095 --> 07:10.530
have a situation on our hands,

07:10.530 --> 07:12.965
and this definitely isn't
gonna get fixed overnight.

07:12.965 --> 07:14.700
Things like this,
especially with the girls,

07:14.700 --> 07:16.202
it takes months.

07:16.202 --> 07:17.970
- Deena, here we are again.

07:17.970 --> 07:20.807
She gets mad
when I get mad at her

07:20.807 --> 07:22.608
for getting involved
in [bleep]

07:22.608 --> 07:23.843
that she shouldn't
get involved in.

07:23.843 --> 07:25.244
- When she got up,

07:25.244 --> 07:26.846
that was just [bleep] crazy
to me.

07:26.846 --> 07:28.381
Like, what?

07:28.381 --> 07:29.816
- Are you gonna fight me?

07:29.816 --> 07:31.083
Like, if I wanted
to fight you, bitch,

07:31.083 --> 07:32.385
I would have walked closer
like this.

07:32.385 --> 07:34.120
Like, I'm not trying
to fight you.

07:34.120 --> 07:36.322
- That wasn't--what was that?

07:36.322 --> 07:37.723
What was that?

07:37.723 --> 07:39.225
- They do things to me,

07:39.225 --> 07:41.394
and then they get mad
that I have a reaction over it.

07:41.394 --> 07:43.062
Am I out of my mind?

07:43.062 --> 07:44.630
- That just shows
who she really is.

07:44.630 --> 07:47.834
- I ain't fighting bitches
with a [bleep] velvet glove on.

07:47.834 --> 07:49.635
OK.

07:49.635 --> 07:52.171
- This is Angelina, the end.

07:52.171 --> 07:54.273
- Bitch, please.
Take several seats.

07:54.273 --> 07:55.942
- I want to go home.

07:55.942 --> 07:58.644
I didn't sign up
for this [bleep].

07:58.644 --> 08:01.113
- You wanted to bring
more drama to our show.

08:01.113 --> 08:03.382
- I was doing a dig at you.
I was.

08:03.382 --> 08:05.351
- You know you're wrong
with the felony thing, though.

08:05.351 --> 08:08.254
- You said you could handle it.
You're not like us.

08:08.254 --> 08:10.523
- I just broke my vagina.

08:10.523 --> 08:14.260
It looked a lot better
than it felt.

08:14.260 --> 08:15.695
- The meatballs don't break.

08:15.695 --> 08:17.697
I don't know what it is.
They're made out of rubber.

08:17.697 --> 08:21.100
<i>♪ ♪</i>

08:25.338 --> 08:27.207
- Welcome back to the reunion.

08:27.207 --> 08:29.976
The roommates are here,
and thank God because

08:29.976 --> 08:32.879
someone needs to explain
this season's social media beef

08:32.879 --> 08:35.148
between Mike and Angelina.

08:35.148 --> 08:37.951
- Oh, damn, all right.
- Angelina felt disrespected.

08:37.951 --> 08:41.021
But was she secretly
in on it from the beginning?

08:41.021 --> 08:42.155
Let's take a look.

08:42.155 --> 08:43.490
- You guys
are on Twitter, right?

08:43.490 --> 08:46.459
Mike took it upon himself
to insert himself

08:46.459 --> 08:48.461
out of nowhere
tweeting bad stuff about me,

08:48.461 --> 08:50.530
<i>calling me a felon,</i>

08:50.530 --> 08:52.165
<i>saying I should have
got arrested.</i>

08:52.165 --> 08:53.533
<i>Like, are you
[bleep] kidding me?</i>

08:53.533 --> 08:55.135
- I saw all those tweets.
- Yeah, I saw them.

08:55.135 --> 08:56.436
- But then--
but then they were deleted.

08:56.436 --> 08:58.238
- You can't post something
like that

08:58.238 --> 09:00.373
and then delete it and then
think I'm not gonna see it.

09:00.373 --> 09:02.008
- I just spit out facts.

09:02.008 --> 09:03.877
And now you're telling me
she's upset.

09:03.877 --> 09:05.879
- Beyond upset.
- Beyond upset?

09:05.879 --> 09:07.447
- Like flipping out.

09:07.447 --> 09:10.383
- Well, Ange, we usually hash
things out on family dinner.

09:10.383 --> 09:12.118
- Why are you talking [bleep]?

09:12.118 --> 09:15.822
- I thought at the time
that it wasn't a big deal

09:15.822 --> 09:18.058
because we had
this text exchange

09:18.058 --> 09:20.227
about live tweeting
for our show.

09:20.227 --> 09:21.361
- I'm gonna be very honest
with you.

09:21.361 --> 09:23.129
I don't remember what we--

09:23.129 --> 09:26.099
- No surprise,
Angeliners is playing dumb.

09:26.099 --> 09:28.001
But I sent the receipts
to everyone.

09:28.001 --> 09:30.103
- Ooh.
- Oh, [bleep].

09:30.103 --> 09:32.405
- It's happening.
- So we're gonna role play.

09:32.405 --> 09:34.207
Vinny is gonna play you.

09:34.207 --> 09:36.910
- Oh!

09:36.910 --> 09:38.812
- Oh, here we go.

09:38.812 --> 09:42.048
- "If I say anything
you don't like,

09:42.048 --> 09:43.950
please just text me,
and I'll delete."

09:43.950 --> 09:45.385
- "No, LOL, leave it.

09:45.385 --> 09:47.087
"Just don't say slut
'cause that [bleep]

09:47.087 --> 09:49.723
ain't allowed no more.
Ha ha ha ha ha."

09:49.723 --> 09:50.991
- This is so stupid.

09:50.991 --> 09:52.392
What are you trying
to get at right now?

09:52.392 --> 09:54.594
- How I feel...
- Oh, my God.

09:54.594 --> 09:56.129
- Is that you initiated this.

09:56.129 --> 09:57.631
- Oh.
- And you texted me.

09:57.631 --> 09:59.199
- Here we go, gaslighter.

09:59.199 --> 10:02.068
- It's very hard when it comes
to Angelina in an argument.

10:02.068 --> 10:03.670
<i>It's like
you're arguing with a wall.</i>

10:03.670 --> 10:05.505
<i>So I need to abort mission
right now</i>

10:05.505 --> 10:07.874
so that we can move forward
as a squad.

10:07.874 --> 10:09.309
Come on, come on.

10:09.309 --> 10:10.677
[all cheering]

10:10.677 --> 10:12.512
- But we still hate each other.
I still hate you.

10:12.512 --> 10:13.813
- Come on.

10:13.813 --> 10:15.382
Come on, come on, come on.

10:15.382 --> 10:16.816
Bring it in.
Sorry.

10:16.816 --> 10:19.052
I love you.
I'm sorry.

10:19.052 --> 10:20.453
- So, Ange and Mike,
what's up

10:20.453 --> 10:22.222
with the fake Twitter beef?

10:22.222 --> 10:23.723
- You know what?

10:23.723 --> 10:26.159
I guess
a miscommunication there.

10:26.159 --> 10:29.362
And we had
this side agreement,

10:29.362 --> 10:32.098
you know, to go harder
on Twitter to promote our show.

10:32.098 --> 10:33.967
- You wanted to bring
more drama to our show.

10:33.967 --> 10:36.536
- And when she said that,
like, this agreement

10:36.536 --> 10:38.905
was never there,
I was like, listen, I have--

10:38.905 --> 10:40.607
I have these receipts.

10:40.607 --> 10:42.842
I have saved them
for a couple of weeks now.

10:42.842 --> 10:45.011
And it was pretty clear.

10:45.011 --> 10:47.347
Now, if she forgot
or maybe she didn't think

10:47.347 --> 10:49.316
they applied to certain
other things, I guess it's--

10:49.316 --> 10:50.617
- That's what it was.
- I guess it's--

10:50.617 --> 10:52.185
I guess it's understandable.

10:52.185 --> 10:54.654
- You know you were wrong
with the felony thing, though.

10:54.654 --> 10:56.656
- I was doing a dig at you.
I was.

10:56.656 --> 10:59.259
A fan had tweeted it to me.

10:59.259 --> 11:01.061
And I was like, "Oh, my God,
it really is a felony."

11:01.061 --> 11:03.330
And I actually checked
and fact checked it.

11:03.330 --> 11:04.864
And obviously,
to be a joke,

11:04.864 --> 11:07.067
I'm like, it takes a felon
to spot a felony,

11:07.067 --> 11:09.569
a con to know a con,
all that stuff to joke around.

11:09.569 --> 11:11.071
It wasn't--
that joke didn't land.

11:11.071 --> 11:14.240
And Angelina took it--
she was very upset.

11:14.240 --> 11:16.876
And that's how
this whole fight started.

11:16.876 --> 11:18.912
- What do you guys think
about the Twitter beef?

11:18.912 --> 11:20.213
Did they need
fake Twitter beef?

11:20.213 --> 11:21.614
Like, what's
everyone else's take?

11:21.614 --> 11:23.583
- The girls and I
are in agreeance.

11:23.583 --> 11:25.919
We don't do things
for, like, fake.

11:25.919 --> 11:27.754
We--we got enough problems
in our lives.

11:27.754 --> 11:32.092
Like, we're not gonna create
unnecessary drama in our life.

11:32.092 --> 11:33.126
- I don't like drama.

11:33.126 --> 11:34.594
Like, it's not--
I'm 36 years old.

11:34.594 --> 11:37.530
I'm not trying to [bleep]
have fake drama on the show.

11:37.530 --> 11:38.798
<i>That's how I took it.</i>

11:38.798 --> 11:39.866
- I was just trying
to say we're not boring.

11:39.866 --> 11:41.134
- I mean, am I wrong?

11:41.134 --> 11:42.302
Is that not
how everybody else took it?

11:42.302 --> 11:43.536
- No, I think
it's a good observation.

11:43.536 --> 11:44.738
<i>- So, Jenni,
I want to ask you.</i>

11:44.738 --> 11:46.673
When Angelina told you
she was upset,

11:46.673 --> 11:48.641
you were, like,
ready to tell Mike off.

11:48.641 --> 11:50.543
- So that was
the actual problem is

11:50.543 --> 11:52.479
that I did go off on Mike bad.

11:52.479 --> 11:53.880
- She did hard, yeah.

11:53.880 --> 11:57.050
- And I texted Mike
and shredded him.

11:57.050 --> 11:59.753
Like, take your [bleep] down.
This is unacceptable.

11:59.753 --> 12:01.254
We're not doing this to her.

12:01.254 --> 12:02.922
And like, 30 minutes goes by.

12:02.922 --> 12:04.958
And Mike's like,
"OK, then what's this?"

12:04.958 --> 12:07.727
And like,
I felt [bleep] stupid.

12:07.727 --> 12:09.195
- Those tweets
didn't have anything to do

12:09.195 --> 12:11.531
with what I agreed to.
It was something else.

12:11.531 --> 12:13.933
- Mike did say,
if you felt like

12:13.933 --> 12:16.036
a tweet crossed the line,
he would take it down,

12:16.036 --> 12:17.804
you know, at your request.
- Yeah.

12:17.804 --> 12:19.472
- So why not just tell him
you were upset?

12:19.472 --> 12:21.875
- Because that night, my phone
was going off and off and off.

12:21.875 --> 12:23.710
And I'm like, "What the
[bleep]?" - OK.

12:23.710 --> 12:25.979
- But why don't you text him,
"Take it down?"

12:25.979 --> 12:27.647
- Why do I gotta text somebody
to take things down for me?

12:27.647 --> 12:29.015
- I would have tooken it down
immediately

12:29.015 --> 12:30.116
if someone texted me.

12:30.116 --> 12:31.551
- You did a couple
of other things,

12:31.551 --> 12:32.886
and it was a little crazy,
too, in the whole midst

12:32.886 --> 12:34.054
of everything.
It wasn't just the felony one.

12:34.054 --> 12:35.388
- But you said
you could handle it.

12:35.388 --> 12:37.390
You're not like us.
- But the felony thing?

12:37.390 --> 12:39.359
Come on, now, girl.
That's, like, ridiculous.

12:39.359 --> 12:40.660
- I would have said,
"Delete that [bleep]."

12:40.660 --> 12:42.862
- I just come
to the conclusion that Ange

12:42.862 --> 12:44.464
is the type to rob you

12:44.464 --> 12:46.032
and then help you look
for your [bleep].

12:46.032 --> 12:47.300
- Why did I hear you
say that before?

12:47.300 --> 12:48.535
That's so stupid.

12:48.535 --> 12:49.969
- OK, fine, I got another one.

12:49.969 --> 12:51.171
- OK.

12:51.171 --> 12:52.472
[laughter]

12:52.472 --> 12:54.207
- Ange is the type
to stab you in the back

12:54.207 --> 12:55.408
and ask you
why you're bleeding.

12:55.408 --> 12:56.776
- OK.

12:56.776 --> 12:59.012
- What's great about Mike,
if he has a good saying,

12:59.012 --> 13:00.580
he's gonna make sure
you hear it.

13:00.580 --> 13:01.815
- And he's gonna put it
on a T-shirt.

13:01.815 --> 13:02.816
- Yeah, it's gonna
be on a shirt.

13:02.816 --> 13:04.150
- Yeah.
- There it is.

13:04.150 --> 13:06.352
- And he's gonna sell it.
- A businessman, at that.

13:06.352 --> 13:09.389
Last season, you guys agreed
to stay off of social media.

13:09.389 --> 13:11.091
Do you think you guys will ever
stick to that pact?

13:11.091 --> 13:12.125
- Probably not.

13:12.125 --> 13:13.460
- Not the way we are.

13:13.460 --> 13:14.627
- Surprisingly,
after fighting with Angelina

13:14.627 --> 13:16.062
for a very long time--

13:16.062 --> 13:17.363
I think it was, like,
a year, a year and a half--

13:17.363 --> 13:18.832
we ended up making up.

13:18.832 --> 13:22.402
And we actually are in
a fairly good place right now,

13:22.402 --> 13:25.305
and so I'm hopeful
for everyone else

13:25.305 --> 13:27.707
to eventually find common
ground and move forward.

13:27.707 --> 13:29.542
- Yeah, that's why, like,
talking about this right now,

13:29.542 --> 13:30.877
like, it's in the past,

13:30.877 --> 13:32.045
but like, you know,
in the midst of it all,

13:32.045 --> 13:32.912
we were both pissed
at each other.

13:32.912 --> 13:33.980
- Yeah.

13:33.980 --> 13:34.914
- But we're in a
good place now.

13:34.914 --> 13:35.982
So that's all that matters.

13:35.982 --> 13:37.150
- Well, that's
what families do.

13:37.150 --> 13:38.485
They love hard
and they fight hard,

13:38.485 --> 13:40.019
but in the end,
you guys always stick it out

13:40.019 --> 13:41.154
and stay together.

13:41.154 --> 13:42.689
Well, coming up
Vinny celebrated

inspired you to throw Angelina

is finally getting divorced.

19:32.105 --> 19:33.172

for her.

19:33.172 --> 19:34.340
- Yeah.

19:34.340 --> 19:35.808
- Burning the dress
that I stole,

19:35.808 --> 19:37.176
like, doing these rituals--

19:37.176 --> 19:39.112
rituals because
we were in cloaks.

19:39.112 --> 19:41.047
But to, like, make sure,
like, she knows,

19:41.047 --> 19:42.615
like, you know,
the bad juju is gone.

19:42.615 --> 19:43.983
- Right.

19:43.983 --> 19:45.151
- Like, you didn't have
a good first marriage?

19:45.151 --> 19:46.285
- Yeah.

19:46.285 --> 19:47.253
- Out with the old,
in with the new.

19:47.253 --> 19:48.454
- Always.
First marriage.

19:48.454 --> 19:50.256
- You didn't have
a good first marriage.

19:50.256 --> 19:52.258
So then, you know,
we got to get the juju away.

19:52.258 --> 19:53.526
And then you can be free
to, you know,

19:53.526 --> 19:55.027
move on and have
a good relationship.

19:55.027 --> 19:56.529
- Yeah, and celebrate
the next chapter...

19:56.529 --> 19:57.697
- Yeah.
- Of life.

19:57.697 --> 19:59.198
I thought that was sweet
of you guys.

19:59.198 --> 20:02.101
Angelina, how did it feel
burning the old wedding dress?

20:02.101 --> 20:03.436
- Oh, my God, I was like, "Ah."

20:03.436 --> 20:06.005
But then Pauly was, like,
dousing it with gasoline.

20:06.005 --> 20:07.840
I'm like,
"It's going. It's gonna go."

20:07.840 --> 20:09.909
And I'm like, "All right,
let me kiss it goodbye."

20:09.909 --> 20:11.711
And then something
came out of it.

20:11.711 --> 20:14.213
Literally, like, something
came out of that dress.

20:14.213 --> 20:15.815
And it was in pictures
and stuff.

20:15.815 --> 20:18.251
<i>It's, like, weird.
- Maybe it's the old Angelina.</i>

20:18.251 --> 20:19.585
<i>- Like a spirit or something.</i>

20:19.585 --> 20:20.753
- Let's see.

20:20.753 --> 20:22.555
- Now, Deena,
you had a whole plan

20:22.555 --> 20:23.856
for after the dress burning,

20:23.856 --> 20:26.292
but Pauly thought
it was basic and upgraded it

20:26.292 --> 20:27.660
with a haunted mansion.

20:27.660 --> 20:29.162
How pissed were you?

20:29.162 --> 20:30.663
- Pauly was like, "I have
no idea what Deena has planned.

20:30.663 --> 20:32.398
"I know she's, like,
a little scaredy cat,

20:32.398 --> 20:35.501
so I'm gonna take over
this entire thing,"

20:35.501 --> 20:37.370
which was fine because
it seemed like everybody had,

20:37.370 --> 20:40.072
like, a really good time.
- It was the best hijacking.

20:40.072 --> 20:42.408
- I wanted to scare everybody
because we were in New Orleans,

20:42.408 --> 20:43.876
and they had this,
like, mansion

20:43.876 --> 20:46.078
that was really haunted
with, like, a haunted house.

20:46.078 --> 20:49.415
So I like Deena's stuff
that we do together, too, but--

20:49.415 --> 20:50.616
- Oh, love you.

20:50.616 --> 20:52.351
- I wanted to this one
and have a little

20:52.351 --> 20:54.086
Pauly D. spin on it.

20:54.086 --> 20:55.521
- Jenni, Zack seemed to be
the most scared

20:55.521 --> 20:56.689
out of everyone.

20:56.689 --> 20:58.124
Did you know he was such
a scaredy cat?

20:58.124 --> 20:59.292
- Tiny ain't hugging me.

20:59.292 --> 21:00.493
- [screams]

21:00.493 --> 21:01.694
- Get the [bleep]
out of here, Tiny!

21:01.694 --> 21:03.062
- What a pussy.

21:03.062 --> 21:04.163
[laughter]

21:04.163 --> 21:06.165
Yes, I do know
'cause I drag him

21:06.165 --> 21:08.301
to horror nights every year.

21:08.301 --> 21:10.703
And it's, like,
my favorite thing and--

21:10.703 --> 21:12.538
- Well, at least
kids get in for free.

21:12.538 --> 21:14.807
- Yes, it's a two-for-one
special at that age.

21:14.807 --> 21:16.108
- [laughs]

21:16.108 --> 21:18.244
- New Orleans sounds
like the perfect place

21:18.244 --> 21:19.812
to celebrate a birthday.

21:19.812 --> 21:21.848
Unfortunately,
Vinny's big day

21:21.848 --> 21:24.250
was underplanned
and overshadowed.

21:24.250 --> 21:26.786
But for real, did you have
any idea that the roommates

21:26.786 --> 21:28.421
ignoring you was just a prank?

21:28.421 --> 21:30.022
Or did you think
they really forgot?

21:30.022 --> 21:32.024
- Well, I knew it was a prank.

21:32.024 --> 21:35.294
But like, I was just like,
are they actually

21:35.294 --> 21:36.496
gonna ever wish me
happy birthday?

21:36.496 --> 21:37.697
- Right.

21:37.697 --> 21:38.998
- Because they're
so [bleep] up that...

21:38.998 --> 21:41.167
- I know.
- You're like, "It's 11:00.

21:41.167 --> 21:42.468
It's went too far."
- Yeah.

21:42.468 --> 21:44.170
- Pauly, what is it
about Vinny's birthday

21:44.170 --> 21:47.340
that makes it so easy
to not celebrate?

21:47.340 --> 21:49.075
- Man, I love birthdays.

21:49.075 --> 21:51.377
And--but, actually,
this was hard for me.

21:51.377 --> 21:53.312
It was hard for me not
to wish him happy birthday

21:53.312 --> 21:55.147
because I love birthdays
so much,

21:55.147 --> 21:57.083
but I like pranks even more.

21:57.083 --> 21:58.918
<i>So pranking him
was the best part,</i>

21:58.918 --> 22:00.620
and then you can't say
that we didn't

22:00.620 --> 22:02.522
throw you a party, dude.
We threw you one.

22:02.522 --> 22:04.423
It's just that
it only lasted five minutes.

22:04.423 --> 22:05.892
- That was it.

22:05.892 --> 22:07.193
- Now, Nicole, you wanted
to rent

22:07.193 --> 22:09.161
a luxurious stripper bus
for Vinny's birthday,

22:09.161 --> 22:11.197
but then a school bus
showed up.

22:11.197 --> 22:12.732
What happened?

22:12.732 --> 22:14.233
<i>- I was thinking, like,
a stretch, like, party bus.</i>

22:14.233 --> 22:15.601
<i>- Right.</i>

22:15.601 --> 22:17.236
<i>- Like, very, like,
elegant and, like,</i>

22:17.236 --> 22:19.105
<i>strippers everywhere,
and then it pulls up.</i>

22:19.105 --> 22:20.673
and I'm like--
- We got the Alabama slammer.

22:20.673 --> 22:22.642
- We got the school bus.
Is this what we ordered?

22:22.642 --> 22:24.911
But I feel like
the girls were amazing.

22:24.911 --> 22:26.979
<i>They were great dancers.</i>

22:26.979 --> 22:28.881
<i>- And I don't want
any elegant strippers, OK?</i>

22:28.881 --> 22:30.116
<i>- No.</i>

22:30.116 --> 22:31.517
<i>- I didn't mean
elegant strippers,</i>

22:31.517 --> 22:33.786
but, like, the bus or whatever.

22:33.786 --> 22:35.555
But I feel like it worked out.
- Yeah, it was good.

22:35.555 --> 22:37.023
- Yeah, it looked
like you guys--

22:37.023 --> 22:38.324
- They came to the club after.
Like, they were nice.

22:38.324 --> 22:39.692
- They were a good time.
- There it is.

22:39.692 --> 22:41.294
- They were nice.

22:41.294 --> 22:43.629
- Vin, what was your reaction
when you saw the stripper bus?

22:43.629 --> 22:45.464
- I was happy
about it, you know?

22:45.464 --> 22:46.599
I mean, it was
a little different.

22:46.599 --> 22:50.169
[laughs]
It was janky as [bleep].

22:50.169 --> 22:51.771
But I liked the effort.

22:51.771 --> 22:54.840
And they--they were mindful
about what I like

22:54.840 --> 22:56.909
for my birthday and strippers.

22:56.909 --> 22:58.344
- Yeah, and once
you got inside the bus

22:58.344 --> 22:59.679
and you saw the strippers...
- Yes.

22:59.679 --> 23:00.980
- You probably felt
even better.

23:00.980 --> 23:02.815
- Yeah, I felt like
I was with my coworkers.

23:02.815 --> 23:04.317
- You were at home.
- I was at home, yeah.

23:04.317 --> 23:05.918
- Yeah.

23:05.918 --> 23:08.287
- And also, like, I will say,
like, strip clubs have become,

23:08.287 --> 23:10.323
like, a staple of this show.
- Yeah.

23:10.323 --> 23:12.892
- Like, we've had some of
the best times in strip clubs.

23:12.892 --> 23:14.193
- Yeah.

23:14.193 --> 23:15.194
- Like, I love seeing them
in strip clubs.

23:15.194 --> 23:16.429
- Yeah.

23:16.429 --> 23:17.597
- So the strippers
aren't just for me.

23:17.597 --> 23:18.798
I love seeing Deena
make it rain.

23:18.798 --> 23:19.899
- Oh, yeah, Deena
was making it rain, yeah.

23:19.899 --> 23:20.766
- Jenni motorboating.
- Yeah.

23:20.766 --> 23:21.834
- It's amazing.

23:21.834 --> 23:23.135
- The whole crew
was turning up.

23:23.135 --> 23:25.037
Vin, how did it feel
to have your birthday

23:25.037 --> 23:27.373
cut short
by Angelina's proposal?

23:27.373 --> 23:28.908
<i>- [sighs]
You know,</i>

23:28.908 --> 23:30.743
<i>I was just taking in
the five minutes that I had,</i>

23:30.743 --> 23:32.378
and I was
really appreciating it.

23:32.378 --> 23:33.713
I knew
it was gonna be short-lived.

23:33.713 --> 23:34.880
- Yeah.

23:34.880 --> 23:36.048
- But I was just so shocked

23:36.048 --> 23:37.016
that I forgot
it was my birthday.

23:37.016 --> 23:38.351
- Right.

23:38.351 --> 23:40.319
- Actually,
now that his birthday

23:40.319 --> 23:42.655
is her anniversary.
- That's weird.

23:42.655 --> 23:43.789
- That's weird as [bleep].
- Yeah.

23:43.789 --> 23:45.191
- Sorry.

23:45.191 --> 23:46.726
- We can do a joint party
forever, yeah.

23:46.726 --> 23:48.194
- You guys are so intermingled.
- You're gonna have to.

23:48.194 --> 23:50.162
I mean, no other choice.
- Well, sorry, Vin.

23:50.162 --> 23:51.731

the dirtiest stay-out

26:12.272 --> 26:13.940
of the dirty stay-outs?

26:13.940 --> 26:15.442

- Really?

26:15.442 --> 26:16.576
- I think we all are.

26:16.576 --> 26:18.478
- You can sometimes
outdrink me.

26:18.478 --> 26:21.848
- But Angelina can outdrink me,
which is scary.

26:21.848 --> 26:22.982
- I think we're all kind of.
- Yeah.

26:22.982 --> 26:24.451
- But I think Nicole
and I are, yeah.

26:24.451 --> 26:25.885
- I think we're crazy.

26:25.885 --> 26:28.188
- I really go hard,
but then I start to tank out.

26:28.188 --> 26:29.522
- OK.

26:29.522 --> 26:32.859
Vinny 2.0 was initiated
as a dirty stay-out.

26:32.859 --> 26:34.727
- He did amazing.
- He did.

26:34.727 --> 26:36.596
- Vinny 2.0 frickin' killed it.
- Mm-hmm.

26:36.596 --> 26:37.797
- He did a good job.

26:37.797 --> 26:38.832
- He, like,
took care of the girls.

26:38.832 --> 26:40.066
He drank.

26:40.066 --> 26:41.835
He had such a good time
with Angelina.

26:41.835 --> 26:44.037
Like, he reminded me
of my Chris

26:44.037 --> 26:46.172
when he's out
and just, like, supportive,

26:46.172 --> 26:49.943
and a good time, and just,
like, having a frickin' blast.

26:49.943 --> 26:51.144
- And even threw you
over the shoulder.

26:51.144 --> 26:52.412
- Yeah.

26:52.412 --> 26:53.613
Like, that's something,
like, you know,

26:53.613 --> 26:55.615
like, I feel like
a dirty stay-out does.

26:55.615 --> 26:57.617
It's like, you take care
of your own.

26:57.617 --> 26:58.985
- You can never leave
a dirty stay-out behind.

26:58.985 --> 27:00.286
- Yep.

27:00.286 --> 27:01.754
- Nicole, what was
going through your mind

27:01.754 --> 27:04.124
when Vinny 2.0 had to throw her
over the shoulder,

27:04.124 --> 27:05.191
bring her in the van?

27:05.191 --> 27:07.227
- So I knew she was wiling out.

27:07.227 --> 27:09.629
I knew she was at that point
to, like, if someone pisses

27:09.629 --> 27:10.964
her off, she's gonna go.
- Yeah.

27:10.964 --> 27:13.066
- And the fact that Vinny
was like, not today--

27:13.066 --> 27:16.202
or Vinny 2.0--
threw her over the shoulder

27:16.202 --> 27:17.737
<i>and, like, brought her in.
This guy's amazing.</i>

27:17.737 --> 27:18.872
- He knew.

27:18.872 --> 27:20.406
- And he took care
of all of us.

27:20.406 --> 27:22.142
Like, he made sure we were
walking down the stairs nice.

27:22.142 --> 27:24.944
And I'm like, "Oh, good guy."

27:24.944 --> 27:27.447
- Vin, what's it gonna take
for you to be a dirty stay-out?

27:27.447 --> 27:28.982
- He is a dirty stay-out.

27:28.982 --> 27:30.316
- He is
a really dirty stay-out.

27:30.316 --> 27:31.317
- Actually--
- Really?

27:31.317 --> 27:32.685
- Yeah, he is.

27:32.685 --> 27:34.621
- All I have to do is just
not wake up at 8:00 a.m.

27:34.621 --> 27:36.122
the next day.

27:36.122 --> 27:39.559
But when we're on vacation,
you know, for some reason,

27:39.559 --> 27:41.661
The days start at 8:00 a.m...
- Yeah.

27:41.661 --> 27:44.764
- For breakfast,
but if I know I have, like,

27:44.764 --> 27:47.300
a later start, I can go hard.

27:47.300 --> 27:50.003
- He's, like, a legit meatball.

27:50.003 --> 27:51.437
- Do you guys
remember the photos

27:51.437 --> 27:52.939
at my wedding of this guy?

27:52.939 --> 27:54.607
- Yeah, he was such a blast.
- The faces he was making?

27:54.607 --> 27:56.075
- And Pauly.
Remember Pauly, too?

27:56.075 --> 27:57.377
- Oh, my God.

27:57.377 --> 27:58.511
<i>- Oh, I love
when Pauly drinks too.</i>

27:58.511 --> 27:59.946
- I love when Pauly drinks.

27:59.946 --> 28:01.181
- Pauly, what do we need to do
to get you to drink?

28:01.181 --> 28:02.248
- I think--
- Pauly, you, too.

28:02.248 --> 28:03.816
- Yeah, it's so much fun.

28:03.816 --> 28:05.151
<i>- Pauly, if we get you
to be able to sleep in also,</i>

28:05.151 --> 28:07.620
will you do a dirty
stay-out night with us?

28:07.620 --> 28:09.088
<i>- 100%.</i>

28:09.088 --> 28:10.390
<i>Dirty stay-out, dirty stay-in.
Let's get it.</i>

28:10.390 --> 28:11.691
- It's gonna happen.
- That's all we want.

28:11.691 --> 28:13.092
That's all we want.
- We're making it happen.

28:13.092 --> 28:14.861
- Well, that sounds like
that's gonna be a fun night.

28:14.861 --> 28:16.129
I can't wait to see that one.

28:16.129 --> 28:17.730
So, Jenni,
how come you don't go out

28:17.730 --> 28:19.866
with the dirty stay-outs?
- Did you see that?

28:19.866 --> 28:21.334
I can't hang with that.

28:21.334 --> 28:22.702
- You got to pick your battles.

28:22.702 --> 28:24.270
- I feel like there's
an initiation involved.

28:24.270 --> 28:26.406
It's like, you got to, like,
be able to hold your own.

28:26.406 --> 28:27.674
- These guys are pros.
- Yeah.

28:27.674 --> 28:28.942
- Do you remember
when she yelled at me?

28:28.942 --> 28:31.578
That Was 1:00 a.m.
- Oh, wow.

28:31.578 --> 28:33.680
- My Meena was at dinner
was because Meena

28:33.680 --> 28:35.582
should have been going to bed.

28:35.582 --> 28:38.117
- The amount of, you know,
alcohol you guys consume,

28:38.117 --> 28:40.320
especially for your size,
it's impressive.

28:40.320 --> 28:42.088
- Well, I just got
my blood work done.

28:42.088 --> 28:44.290
My liver is OK.
So thank God.

28:44.290 --> 28:45.825
- Clap it up for the liver.

28:45.825 --> 28:47.327
- These guys are
pound-for-pound champs.

28:47.327 --> 28:49.596
- I always get my blood work
done every year

28:49.596 --> 28:51.064
to make sure everything
is good.

28:51.064 --> 28:52.098
- I love that.

28:52.098 --> 28:54.334
- And so far--
- So good.

28:54.334 --> 28:55.802
- I mean, I don't want to...
- Healthy as a horse.

28:55.802 --> 28:57.670
Knock on wood.
Yeah, there it is.

28:57.670 --> 29:00.440
Coming up,
we got more fan questions.

29:00.440 --> 29:03.476
And does Vinny remember
any of his dance moves?

29:03.476 --> 29:05.645
We put them to the test next.

29:05.645 --> 29:07.847
- Please don't.
Nicole?

29:07.847 --> 29:10.583
- He had his big moment
on his interview,

29:10.583 --> 29:12.752
and he took that opportunity
to--

29:12.752 --> 29:15.255
- To [bleep] on himself, yeah.

29:15.255 --> 29:16.589
- He was not backed up.

29:16.589 --> 29:18.791
I definitely took care of him.

29:18.791 --> 29:21.494
- OK.

The fan questions keep coming.

29:34.707 --> 29:38.077
This crew has been tossing sack
to avoid fan questions,

29:38.077 --> 29:40.313

29:40.313 --> 29:43.683
Now remember, the roommates
can skip any fan question,

a sack in the hole.

Vin, you went crazy.

30:10.576 --> 30:12.011

- Good job, good job.

30:12.011 --> 30:14.113

but what did you feel?

30:14.113 --> 30:16.082
- It was a negative 10.

30:16.082 --> 30:17.283
[laughter]

30:17.283 --> 30:19.052

Good job.

because Louis Vuitton didn't
want you wearing their brand."

30:30.330 --> 30:31.764
Is that true?
- I saw it on TikTok.

30:31.764 --> 30:33.366
- There's so many
TikToks of this.

30:33.366 --> 30:34.367
No, that's not true.
- OK.

30:34.367 --> 30:35.835
- No.

30:35.835 --> 30:37.036
- And if it was true,
that would be [bleep] amazing.

30:37.036 --> 30:38.438
- Amazing.

30:38.438 --> 30:39.572
- We're getting free Guccis
from Louis Vuitton.

30:39.572 --> 30:40.740
- Not a bad deal.

30:40.740 --> 30:42.108
- I mean,
I wish that were true, but--

30:42.108 --> 30:43.476
- No, we could
only afford Gucci.

30:43.476 --> 30:45.678
- Could you still send it?
- Urban legend debunked.

30:45.678 --> 30:46.946
- So that was not true.

30:46.946 --> 30:48.748
Stop making
the stupid TikToks about it.

30:48.748 --> 30:50.216
- Well, listen,
if you guys still want

30:50.216 --> 30:52.185
to send the ladies purses,
they're open to it, Gucci.

30:52.185 --> 30:53.519
- Please, by all means.

30:53.519 --> 30:54.954
- And we love Louis Vuitton.
<i>- And guys.</i>

30:54.954 --> 30:56.489
- Send us Gucci.

30:56.489 --> 30:58.858
- Now, don't get it twisted,
strippers are dancers, too.

30:58.858 --> 31:00.159
- Mm-hmm.

31:00.159 --> 31:03.162
- This season, Vinny got
his gym, tan, lunge on

31:03.162 --> 31:06.399
for "Dancing with the Stars"
to prove he's got the moves.

31:06.399 --> 31:07.967
Take a look.

- Wow.

31:29.789 --> 31:31.958
I get that a lot, don't worry.

31:31.958 --> 31:34.060
- Can we come this week?

31:34.060 --> 31:36.062
- I'd rather you not.

31:36.062 --> 31:37.563
We're just--I'm just
trying to focus on the--

31:37.563 --> 31:38.831
- You don't want your friends
to support you?

31:38.831 --> 31:39.966
- When they come to town,

31:39.966 --> 31:41.300
they're like
a traveling circus.

31:41.300 --> 31:42.802
- My boyfriend
hurt his leg stripping.

31:42.802 --> 31:45.138
- You guys are embarrassing.
- Stripper injury.

31:45.138 --> 31:47.240
- And I don't need that type
of distraction right now.

31:47.240 --> 31:48.641
<i>- We're gonna help you
get him ready.</i>

31:48.641 --> 31:49.942
<i>We're gonna come to LA.</i>

31:49.942 --> 31:51.677
- The placement
with the hands.

31:51.677 --> 31:53.479
- The frame?
Oh.

31:53.479 --> 31:55.782
- Oh!
- Come on, baby.

31:55.782 --> 31:57.450
Come on, daddy.
Let's do it.

31:57.450 --> 31:58.785
- OK.
- Which way are you going?

31:58.785 --> 32:00.553
- Yo, y'all guys changed.

32:00.553 --> 32:02.555
I remember when you used
to work out in the gym.

32:02.555 --> 32:04.524
- Since I started training for
"Dancing with the Stars," like,

32:04.524 --> 32:06.692
my whole world has just
been this competition.

32:06.692 --> 32:08.194
- M.
- V.

32:08.194 --> 32:09.495
- P.
- Premiere night!

32:09.495 --> 32:12.298
- Let's go.
- This is your night, kid.

32:12.298 --> 32:13.699
- Let's go, baby.

32:13.699 --> 32:14.934
- Let's go.
Thank you.

32:14.934 --> 32:16.502
Love you guys.
- We'll lock up.

32:16.502 --> 32:18.137
- And don't [bleep] up
like you did at the wedding.

32:18.137 --> 32:19.605
- My God.
Vinny, yes, this is great.

32:19.605 --> 32:20.773
This is great.

32:20.773 --> 32:22.241
- Ah.

32:22.241 --> 32:23.943
[all cheering]

32:23.943 --> 32:25.745
- Oh...
- Does he have muttonchops?

32:25.745 --> 32:27.914
- My god.

32:27.914 --> 32:29.382
- Really, really fun to watch.
- I'm trying.

32:29.382 --> 32:30.783
I'm learning this every week,
like, for the first time.

32:30.783 --> 32:32.985
- Now, Mike "The Situation"
is here,

32:32.985 --> 32:34.454
and he was on the show.

32:34.454 --> 32:37.323
Now, did he give you any advice
coming in this week?

32:37.323 --> 32:38.724
- I would give him
advice and be like, "Yo,

32:38.724 --> 32:39.792
take your sunglasses off, bro."

32:39.792 --> 32:41.427
[laughter]

32:41.427 --> 32:43.896
- Vinny could actually
go to, like, the finals.

32:43.896 --> 32:46.466
<i>Like, he is getting through
to every single week.</i>

32:46.466 --> 32:47.800
<i>This is crazy.</i>

32:47.800 --> 32:48.801
- You crushed it.

32:48.801 --> 32:50.036
- Vin, you did an amazing job.

32:50.036 --> 32:51.504
- Yes.
[applause]

32:51.504 --> 32:52.738
- Great job, Vin.

32:52.738 --> 32:53.873
- It's all coming back.
- Wow.

32:53.873 --> 32:55.208
- So good.

32:55.208 --> 32:56.676
- What surprised you most
about your experience

32:56.676 --> 32:58.377
on "Dancing With the Stars?"

32:58.377 --> 33:00.646
- Just how insanely difficult
it was gonna be.

33:00.646 --> 33:02.315
You have to be perfect.

33:02.315 --> 33:04.150
If you're not perfect,
you look like a fool.

33:04.150 --> 33:05.151
- Right.
Well, you did a great job.

33:05.151 --> 33:06.452
- Thank you.

33:06.452 --> 33:07.520
- You definitely looked like
you had moves.

33:07.520 --> 33:08.754
- Thank you.

33:08.754 --> 33:10.189
- Now, Mike and Nicole,
did either of you

33:10.189 --> 33:12.024
have advice for Vinny
prior to going on the show

33:12.024 --> 33:13.693
since you'd had experience?

33:13.693 --> 33:16.195
- I think we both separately
hit him up

33:16.195 --> 33:17.363
and let him know
that, like,

33:17.363 --> 33:18.631
we definitely believe in him.

33:18.631 --> 33:20.366
Vinny is a way better dancer
than I ever did,

33:20.366 --> 33:21.934
and I got four rounds.

33:21.934 --> 33:23.669
I knew he was gonna go far.
And he actually did.

33:23.669 --> 33:24.937
He got, like, 9 or 10 rounds.

33:24.937 --> 33:26.906
So super proud
of how far he took it.

33:26.906 --> 33:28.941
- It's like my top three things
that I've

33:28.941 --> 33:30.943
ever done in my entire life.
- That's so cool.

33:30.943 --> 33:32.445
- So it's just a really,
really great experience.

33:32.445 --> 33:33.613
- Yeah.

33:33.613 --> 33:35.348
- Now, Mike and Pauly,
Vinny originally

33:35.348 --> 33:37.884
told you not to come
to LA before the premiere.

33:37.884 --> 33:40.620
What made you want
to come support him anyway?

33:40.620 --> 33:42.855
- I wouldn't let him do this
on his own.

33:42.855 --> 33:44.323
He always has our support.

33:44.323 --> 33:45.958
And something this big--

33:45.958 --> 33:47.326
listen, I was so invested
in the show.

33:47.326 --> 33:48.628
I watched every single episode.

33:48.628 --> 33:50.596
I was so invested,
I got so mad

33:50.596 --> 33:52.565
<i>at the judges
for being so hard on him</i>

33:52.565 --> 33:53.933
<i>because I seen how hard
he was trying</i>

33:53.933 --> 33:55.501
<i>and how good he really was.</i>

33:55.501 --> 33:56.936
Like, he killed that.
- Yeah.

33:56.936 --> 33:58.204
- So the judges
were pissing me off.

33:58.204 --> 34:00.339
- When they came,
it was an event.

34:00.339 --> 34:02.408
Like, everybody was
taking pictures with them.

34:02.408 --> 34:04.410
<i>Everyone was so happy
to meet them, you know?</i>

34:04.410 --> 34:06.379
And I got to show them,
like, this is--

34:06.379 --> 34:07.980
I was like introducing them
to my family, you know?

34:07.980 --> 34:09.282
- Yeah, yeah.
- It was great.

34:09.282 --> 34:11.017
- It was lit.
- And Mike wore that shirt.

34:11.017 --> 34:12.385
- Yes, he did.
- Yes.

34:12.385 --> 34:13.719
- And you know,
and props to you.

34:13.719 --> 34:14.820
You just finished
this whole routine.

34:14.820 --> 34:16.088
- Oh, yeah.

34:16.088 --> 34:17.290
- And you still
were able to roast him.

34:17.290 --> 34:18.424
- I would give him advice
and be like, "Yo,

34:18.424 --> 34:19.525
take your sunglasses off, bro."

34:19.525 --> 34:20.793
[laughter]

34:20.793 --> 34:21.827
- You got that quick roast
in there, Vin.

34:21.827 --> 34:23.029
I noticed that.

34:23.029 --> 34:24.931
You can take the boy
out of the shore,

34:24.931 --> 34:26.232
but you can't take
the shore out of the boy.

34:26.232 --> 34:28.334
- He had his big moment
on his interview.

34:28.334 --> 34:32.538
And he took that opportunity
to roast his besties.

34:32.538 --> 34:34.640
- You should feel honored,
Mike.

34:34.640 --> 34:36.509
- My wife told me
not to wear the shirt.

34:36.509 --> 34:37.743
- Yeah.

34:37.743 --> 34:38.911
- Secretly,
I knew that the girls

34:38.911 --> 34:40.112
were gonna tell me
the same thing.

34:40.112 --> 34:42.315
- Yeah.
- But BDS was gonna be BDS.

34:42.315 --> 34:44.483
- Vinny, you told the boys
that them visiting you in LA

34:44.483 --> 34:46.886
and supporting you was
something you'd never forget.

34:46.886 --> 34:48.988
How much did that mean to you?

34:48.988 --> 34:51.324
- Honestly, that one night
was one of the best nights

34:51.324 --> 34:53.359
of my life...
- Aw.

34:53.359 --> 34:56.195
- Because I had a rough time
on "Dancing With the Stars."

34:56.195 --> 34:58.731
Like, one week, I'd be bad,
and one week, I'd be better.

34:58.731 --> 35:00.099
So that was one
of the better nights.

35:00.099 --> 35:01.300
- Yeah.
- I had my boys there.

35:01.300 --> 35:02.468
We went to eat afterwards
and celebrate.

35:02.468 --> 35:03.703
- Yeah.

35:03.703 --> 35:04.904
- And it was just, like,
the best night.

35:04.904 --> 35:06.372
<i>- Aw.
</i>- So fun.

35:06.372 --> 35:08.574
- Well, I look forward to
seeing more of the shoremates

35:08.574 --> 35:10.209
on "Dancing With the Stars"
because all three

35:10.209 --> 35:12.478
of you guys who have been on it
have killed it so far.

35:12.478 --> 35:14.247
So big up to Vinny
for going that far.

35:14.247 --> 35:15.815
- That's what she said.
- [laughs]

35:15.815 --> 35:19.051
- Coming up, this season's
funniest moments are up next.

35:19.051 --> 35:21.020
- Vinny, dip me out the break.
- Let's dip.

35:21.020 --> 35:22.388
- Let me...
- Aw.

35:22.388 --> 35:23.522
- Let me see if
I got some moves.

35:23.522 --> 35:24.457
- Dip, baby.
- How we doing this?

35:24.457 --> 35:25.658
- Oh, you got the moves.

35:25.658 --> 35:26.859
- Let's dip, baby, dip.
- Like this.

35:26.859 --> 35:28.027
- OK.
- Ready?

35:28.027 --> 35:29.195
Go down.

35:29.195 --> 35:30.730
- Nicole, do you
wear heels like that?

35:30.730 --> 35:32.765
- Yeah, now let's do one
and like--

35:32.765 --> 35:33.833
- OK, let's do it.
Ready?

35:33.833 --> 35:35.935
- They're small dancers.
- Yeah.

35:35.935 --> 35:38.271
- Oh.
- Whoa!

35:38.271 --> 35:40.740

pent-up anger on Nicole

35:40.740 --> 35:42.908

37:00.220 --> 37:02.589
This is kind of where
I miss Deeners

because Deeners would be able
to, like, pull through.

37:05.191 --> 37:06.993
Deena would do it

37:06.993 --> 37:08.962
I miss Deeners.
Deener.

37:08.962 --> 37:10.296
I miss Deena.
She would never do that.

No-nut November is over.

37:18.838 --> 37:20.740
- I knew it!
The way you came in was--

gonna tell you guys.

you hit that bed</i>

37:28.448 --> 37:31.184

37:31.184 --> 37:33.786
- Ugh.
I'm not a man, Vinny.

37:33.786 --> 37:37.090
I don't need to know when you
nut and when you don't nut.

37:37.090 --> 37:38.625
- [laughs]
Vote for Vinny.

37:38.625 --> 37:40.026
- I don't understand
why he didn't want us

37:40.026 --> 37:41.361
to come out here, man.
- I know.

37:41.361 --> 37:42.862
He was like,
"Don't embarrass him."

37:42.862 --> 37:44.564
We would never embarrass him.
- Oh, we're so low-key.

37:44.564 --> 37:45.899
- Yeah.

37:45.899 --> 37:47.600

you spelled your name wrong.

37:47.600 --> 37:49.669
- Oh, [bleep].
- Ah.

37:49.669 --> 37:52.305

37:52.305 --> 37:53.873
I, like, blast it.

37:55.375 --> 37:58.878
- Ooh!
- Damn.

37:58.878 --> 38:01.014
- They've been fighting
all trip.

38:01.014 --> 38:02.749
- I'm backed up.
That's why.

38:02.749 --> 38:06.085
- Oh!
- Oh!

38:06.085 --> 38:07.754
- Time the [bleep] out!

- Well, if this is what
five years of marriage

38:15.295 --> 38:18.631
looks like, we got a situation.
- [laughs]

38:18.631 --> 38:20.200
- Well, Deena,
I guess we know

38:20.200 --> 38:22.202
how you keep
your marriage spicy.

38:22.202 --> 38:23.603
- Oh, my.

38:23.603 --> 38:24.938
- So now,
Chris complained

38:24.938 --> 38:26.339
that he was backed up
during the trip.

38:26.339 --> 38:27.874
Was that due to the injury?

38:27.874 --> 38:30.410
- Ooh.
- He was not backed up.

38:30.410 --> 38:32.845
I definitely took care of him.
- OK?

38:32.845 --> 38:33.947
Period.

38:33.947 --> 38:35.181
- I mean,
I just broke my vagina.

38:35.181 --> 38:37.116
How are we supposed
to do regular sex?

38:37.116 --> 38:39.385
It was bruised.
- Yeah.

38:39.385 --> 38:41.354
- It needed a day off.
- You [bleep] the [bleep]?

38:41.354 --> 38:42.722
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

38:42.722 --> 38:44.557
- I couldn't believe it
when you said it.

38:44.557 --> 38:45.992
But I was so--you know,
Deena, because you're--

38:45.992 --> 38:47.227
- Because I couldn't believe
he was saying it.

38:47.227 --> 38:48.494
- Yeah.
- I'm like--

38:48.494 --> 38:50.096
<i>- But it was good to see you--</i>

38:50.096 --> 38:52.732
because you're so sweet
so that when you do turn up,

38:52.732 --> 38:54.500
it's like, OK, Deena,
talk your [bleep].

38:54.500 --> 38:56.069
- I guess.

38:56.069 --> 38:58.404
- So, Jenni, were you letting
out pent-up anger on Nicole

38:58.404 --> 38:59.872
with the tortilla slap?

38:59.872 --> 39:01.207
- I don't know
where that came from.

39:01.207 --> 39:02.542
- Yes.

39:02.542 --> 39:05.178
- In my mind, it did not hit.
- You hurt me.

39:05.178 --> 39:07.513
- Like, it did not hit the way
that everyone was like, "oh."

39:07.513 --> 39:08.915
So I was like, "Oh, no,
what did I do?"

39:08.915 --> 39:10.316
- No, it hit my face.
- It slapped.

39:10.316 --> 39:11.818
- Yeah.
- It slapped.

39:11.818 --> 39:13.052
- You don't know
your own strength.

39:13.052 --> 39:14.821
- Oh, I feel bad.

39:14.821 --> 39:17.857
- Pauly, you tried pranking
Vinny by vandalizing his car,

39:17.857 --> 39:21.461
but you pranked yourself
by spelling your name wrong.

39:21.461 --> 39:24.097
Can you please
spell Pauly for us?

39:24.097 --> 39:28.234
- What happened was those
markers were acting up, man.

39:28.234 --> 39:29.836
[laughs]

39:29.836 --> 39:32.739
- I drove that thing
from North Hollywood

39:32.739 --> 39:34.107
to West Hollywood.
- Yes.

39:34.107 --> 39:35.775
- And people, like,
recognized me.

39:35.775 --> 39:37.310
- Yeah.

39:37.310 --> 39:38.511
- So I'm in the car
and it says, "Vote for Vinny"

39:38.511 --> 39:40.580
all over the car.
- A little self-promo.

39:40.580 --> 39:41.948
- TMZ is driving by.

39:41.948 --> 39:43.016
- That might have got you
a blast of votes.

39:43.016 --> 39:44.484
- Maybe.
- Yeah.

39:44.484 --> 39:47.420
- So what was everybody's
favorite moment this season?

39:47.420 --> 39:50.757
- The night that the guys came
to "Dancing With the Stars"

39:50.757 --> 39:52.125
and we just
celebrated together.

39:52.125 --> 39:53.559
- That was fun.

39:53.559 --> 39:55.561
- The MVP trip in LA,
which was amazing food,

39:55.561 --> 39:57.030
an amazing moment for MVP,

39:57.030 --> 39:58.464

- And then, listen, I jumped
out of a plane, as well.

40:00.833 --> 40:01.968
- Crazy, yeah.
- Yeah.

40:01.968 --> 40:03.202
- A lot of
memorable moments, yeah.

40:03.202 --> 40:04.337
- Yeah.

40:04.337 --> 40:05.438
- My favorite moment
this season

40:05.438 --> 40:07.140
was probably the girls' trip.

40:07.140 --> 40:09.275
I had so much fun there.

40:09.275 --> 40:11.711
And like,
it was such a cute city.

40:11.711 --> 40:13.846
- I just feel like we all
were just, like, girls.

40:13.846 --> 40:15.181
And we had a good time.

40:15.181 --> 40:16.416
There was no drama,
and it was just--

40:16.416 --> 40:17.850
- It was nice.

40:17.850 --> 40:19.419
- It was just like a normal,
like, girls' fun time.

40:19.419 --> 40:21.054
- Yeah, bonding.
- And that's what I love.

40:21.054 --> 40:22.455
That's what I love
with my girlfriends.

40:22.455 --> 40:23.556

the girls' trip.
