Emilie.

02:16.500 --> 02:17.500
Honey.

02:17.700 --> 02:18.700
Emilie.

02:23.600 --> 02:25.000
Where are we?

02:26.500 --> 02:28.500
Somewhere off from Hills Road.

02:30.300 --> 02:31.500
What's happening?

02:32.400 --> 02:33.200
I don't know.

02:33.300 --> 02:38.500
<i>This is an emergency broadcast issued
from Montgomery County. Please stand by.</i>

02:41.600 --> 02:43.000
Oh, Jesus.

02:43.800 --> 02:45.000
You're hurt.

02:45.400 --> 02:48.000
- Emilie, you're hurt.
- I'm fine.

02:52.400 --> 02:54.000
Okay, uh...

02:55.000 --> 02:58.500
Tell me what to do, all right?
How do I... how do I fix it?

03:00.500 --> 03:01.500
You can't.

03:07.900 --> 03:09.500
I love you, Jim.

03:10.600 --> 03:14.200
No. No. No, no, no, no, no.
Okay, we're gonna fix you, all right?

03:14.300 --> 03:17.500
I'm gonna get you to a hospital,
and everything is just gonna be fine.

03:17.600 --> 03:20.500
Okay? So just... Emilie, hold on.

03:21.100 --> 03:22.100
Emilie.

03:22.700 --> 03:24.500
Emilie, wake up!

03:27.500 --> 03:30.000
Wake... Wait...

03:31.000 --> 03:32.500
Don't go.

03:33.700 --> 03:35.000
Please don't go.

03:36.300 --> 03:38.500
Please don't go away from me.

04:33.400 --> 04:34.500
Hello.

05:41.600 --> 05:44.000
<i>Try not... to Montgomery County.</i>

05:46.900 --> 05:49.500
<i>Well, according to live witnesses
regarding the recent events</i>

05:49.600 --> 05:53.500
<i>currently taking place in Montgomery
County, where an explosion has happened.</i>

05:53.600 --> 05:55.300
<i>We're trying our best
to bring you new information,</i>

05:55.400 --> 05:57.500
<i>but we really don't know
what is going on.</i>

05:57.600 --> 06:00.800
<i>Earlier this morning,
at approximately 7:30, reports came in</i>

06:00.900 --> 06:03.900
<i>that there was an explosion
on the outskirts of Montgomery County.</i>

06:04.000 --> 06:07.800
<i>Now, we don't know if this was an act
of terrorism or merely an accident.</i>

06:07.900 --> 06:09.400
<i>It's too early to say at this point.</i>

06:09.500 --> 06:12.500
<i>To hopefully fill us in on what is going
on, we'll go live to one of our analysts</i>

06:12.600 --> 06:16.600
<i>whos reporting to us via satellite phone
from just outside Montgomery County.</i>

06:16.700 --> 06:18.000
<i>Bill, are you there?</i>

06:18.500 --> 06:21.800
<i>Uh, yes, Amy, thank you.
Uh, we don't know much as of right now.</i>

06:21.900 --> 06:24.200
<i>All that we can tell you is
the military isn't letting</i>

06:24.300 --> 06:28.500
<i>anybody in or out of the county.
In fact, it's quite frightening that...</i>

06:28.800 --> 06:33.500
<i>...military officials and helicopters,
literally coming from every direction.</i>

06:33.600 --> 06:36.800
<i>...appearing out of nowhere, and
they're not telling us what's going on.</i>

06:36.900 --> 06:39.400
<i>Cell phone communication
seems to be down.</i>

06:39.500 --> 06:42.400
<i>Landline phones only seem to be working
within the county.</i>

06:42.500 --> 06:44.900
<i>This is believed to be
a part of the military's procedure</i>

06:45.000 --> 06:46.600
<i>in quarantining this town.</i>

06:46.700 --> 06:48.500
<i>Now, we've been hearing
that there is smoke visible.</i>

06:48.600 --> 06:50.300
<i>Can you fill us in on that?</i>

06:50.400 --> 06:52.700
<i>Uh, yes, I'm standing
just on the outside</i>

06:52.800 --> 06:56.100
<i>of the western border of Montgomery
County and when I look towards the east,</i>

06:56.200 --> 06:59.100
<i>I see a massive cloud of smoke
coming from the ground.</i>

06:59.200 --> 07:02.200
<i>Now I can only guess...
that's what is causing this panic.</i>

07:02.300 --> 07:05.200
<i>I-I've noticed that
the military is wearing gas masks.</i>

07:05.300 --> 07:08.200
<i>They're actually rounding up reporters
to leave the area.</i>

07:08.300 --> 07:10.000
<i>And, uh, quite frankly...</i>

07:10.800 --> 07:11.900
<i>I am trying to get...</i>

07:12.000 --> 07:15.000
<i>Hold on, hold on one second, Amy.
There's something happening.</i>

07:15.100 --> 07:17.300
<i>- There's a man walking towards us.
- Bill, are you there?</i>

07:17.400 --> 07:20.500
<i>Uh, there's a man walking towards us
right now, with nothing on...</i>

07:20.900 --> 07:22.000
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

07:22.400 --> 07:23.500
<i>Jesus!</i>

07:29.800 --> 07:33.000
<i>They just... they just shot a guy
that was trying to cross...</i>

07:33.400 --> 07:34.500
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

07:35.100 --> 07:37.000
<i>Hey, what's going on? What happened?</i>

07:40.200 --> 07:41.200
<i>Bill.</i>

07:42.900 --> 07:44.500
<i>Bill, talk to us, please.</i>

07:46.900 --> 07:49.000
<i>Can somebody tell me what's going on?</i>

09:24.100 --> 09:29.100
<i>...a large number of military aircraft
taking off from Clark County Airport.</i>

09:29.200 --> 09:32.500
<i>Uh, which is a bordering county
to Montgomery County.</i>

09:32.600 --> 09:38.000
<i>I'm standing just south of
the airport's main runway, and I'm so...</i>

09:38.500 --> 09:42.400
<i>...all around me. Uh, they're starting
to take off, and I'm starting to see</i>

09:42.500 --> 09:46.900
<i>helicopters in every direction,
as they rise to the skies around me.</i>

09:47.000 --> 09:52.900
<i>Uh, suddenly, some are beginning
to now appear off a distance, and, uh,</i>

09:53.000 --> 09:57.700
<i>I would guess it has to be restrictive
to aircraft, uh, airborne at this time.</i>

09:57.800 --> 10:03.000
<i>There're so many that I can't even count
them all. It truly is a fascinating...</i>

10:48.100 --> 10:49.500
Hey!

16:35.300 --> 16:36.500
Hello!

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
Is somebody behind there?

17:33.100 --> 17:35.000
I know somebody's in there!

17:35.800 --> 17:39.500
I have a gun and I'm not afraid
to use it, so come out right now!

17:48.200 --> 17:53.000
This is your last chance!
Come out right now!

17:55.700 --> 17:57.000
Shit!

18:05.600 --> 18:07.500
♪ Wa-sSsSs-u;P ♪

21:22.400 --> 21:23.500
Please.

22:27.200 --> 22:28.200
Hello.

22:29.300 --> 22:31.000
Are you the person in the barn?

22:33.200 --> 22:34.500
Who is this?

22:35.400 --> 22:39.500
Thank God. I've tried every number
in the book to get a hold of somebody.

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
I heard gunshots. Are you okay?

22:43.200 --> 22:45.000
How do you know where I am?

22:45.500 --> 22:49.000
Your lights.
We're just down the hill from you.

22:52.700 --> 22:54.500
We're in the warehouse
just to the north.

22:56.600 --> 22:58.500
Hey, Julie, flip the lights.

23:00.200 --> 23:01.200
You see us?

23:07.200 --> 23:08.200
Yeah.

23:09.500 --> 23:13.000
I think he will need this.
How many are in your group?

23:13.400 --> 23:17.500
Just me. You?

23:18.000 --> 23:21.500
There's three of us. We've been
holding up pretty good down here.

23:22.100 --> 23:23.700
You're the first person
we've been able to contact

23:23.800 --> 23:25.500
since this whole thing started.

23:26.500 --> 23:30.000
We have plenty of food and water.
Should last us at least a week or so.

23:31.000 --> 23:32.500
How're you holding up?

23:39.300 --> 23:40.500
Not good.

23:41.300 --> 23:43.500
Well, you're more than welcome
to join us if you want.

23:44.300 --> 23:45.500
Do you care for the hike?

24:46.200 --> 24:49.500
Think we're in luck.
I don't think they saw you.

24:56.700 --> 25:00.000
I'm Scott. We talked on the phone.

25:03.200 --> 25:07.500
You got a name or should I just call you
"guy I talked to on the phone"?

25:08.500 --> 25:11.500
- Jim.
- Well, nice to meet you, Jim.

25:13.500 --> 25:18.500
- Nice to meet you too.
- Well, how about a grand tour?

25:21.900 --> 25:23.000
So, what do you think?

25:25.500 --> 25:26.500
Nice, huh?

25:33.500 --> 25:35.000
It's big.

25:35.300 --> 25:40.500
- Scott.
- Oh, yeah, Jim, this is my wife, Julie.

25:40.900 --> 25:44.500
It's so nice to meet you.
Would you care for something to drink?

25:46.200 --> 25:49.500
- Water would be great.
- Sure thing.

25:53.200 --> 25:56.000
Well, Jim, come make yourself at home.

25:57.200 --> 26:00.000
As you can see here, we got
plenty of square footage to go around.

26:00.800 --> 26:01.700
All the exits are, uh...

26:01.800 --> 26:05.500
securely locked from the inside, so
only way in and out is, uh, with a key.

26:06.400 --> 26:09.500
Got no windows, so we can
keep the lights on as long as we want.

26:10.000 --> 26:12.500
We got power running from the generator
right over there.

26:13.600 --> 26:15.500
It's gotta fill up from time to time.

26:15.800 --> 26:20.500
- Wow, this is great.
- Yeah, we were lucky.

26:21.500 --> 26:23.500
My neighbor actually owns the place.

26:25.800 --> 26:28.000
Frankly, it was the only place
I can think to go to.

26:29.700 --> 26:31.000
What's upstairs?

26:32.300 --> 26:36.500
Mainly offices. We keep
most of our supplies up here though.

26:37.800 --> 26:39.000
In case one of those things gets in,

26:39.100 --> 26:41.500
we can retreat up here
and barricade ourselves in.

26:42.900 --> 26:45.500
Actually, the only way up here
is through that door down there.

26:47.100 --> 26:49.500
Think of it as a, uh,
last line of defense.

26:52.600 --> 26:53.600
Who is that?

26:54.700 --> 26:59.000
Oh, that's Ix.
She's not the easiest to talk to.

27:00.200 --> 27:04.000
- What happened to her?
- We don't know exactly.

27:05.200 --> 27:06.400
When Julie and I were headed here,

27:06.500 --> 27:09.500
we found her hunkered down in
a storm drain on the side of the road.

27:10.100 --> 27:14.000
At first, we thought
she was one of them, but then she spoke.

27:15.200 --> 27:18.500
Asked her if she wanted to join us, so
that's why she's here.

27:19.600 --> 27:22.500
She'll warm up to you, eventually.
Just give her some time.

27:24.000 --> 27:26.500
- Scott.
- Yeah?

27:27.000 --> 27:30.300
Ask Jim if he's hungry. I feel so rude
for not offering any food.

27:30.400 --> 27:32.000
All right, honey.

27:35.400 --> 27:36.500
You hungry?

27:54.700 --> 27:55.700
Sorry.

27:56.200 --> 28:00.500
It's okay. We have plenty to go around.
Don't worry about it.

28:02.300 --> 28:06.000
Julie cleaned your shirt for you.
Think she did the best she could here.

28:06.200 --> 28:07.500
Thanks.

28:08.300 --> 28:11.000
Well, I hope this cot is, uh,
comfortable enough for you.

28:11.600 --> 28:15.000
And, uh, sorry
if the sheets smell like crap.

28:16.100 --> 28:18.000
Pretty much all we can find around here.

28:18.800 --> 28:20.000
It's great.

28:21.800 --> 28:24.000
You know,
just think of it like summer camp.

28:25.000 --> 28:28.000
Except,
you can't really go outside and play.

28:31.300 --> 28:35.000
- Get some sleep. We'll talk tomorrow.
- Yeah.

28:44.200 --> 28:45.200
Hi.

29:29.100 --> 29:32.400
<i>Yeah, yeah, I still remember that,
actually, but, uh, we're actually, uh,</i>

29:32.500 --> 29:35.900
<i>just hitting 6:30, and we have some, uh,
great music planned today,</i>

29:36.000 --> 29:39.000
<i>and if you stay tuned for later,
we're gonna have our late-day drawing...</i>

30:13.100 --> 30:14.500
You look handsome.

30:16.900 --> 30:18.000
What are you doing up?

30:18.800 --> 30:21.000
I have something for you,
and I couldn't wait.

30:22.400 --> 30:25.500
Oh, is it that time of the year already?

30:27.900 --> 30:30.500
I thought we said
we're gonna save our money for the move.

30:31.300 --> 30:34.000
It's not expensive, please.

30:35.700 --> 30:40.000
Okay, but hurry, I'm gonna be late.

30:52.900 --> 30:54.000
What is it?

31:00.300 --> 31:04.000
Oh, my God, where'd you find this?

31:04.300 --> 31:08.500
I stopped in at John's store to say hi,
and saw it sitting on the top shelf.

31:08.800 --> 31:10.000
I knew you had to have it.

31:13.400 --> 31:17.000
It's just exactly like the one
I had as a kid.

31:17.300 --> 31:19.000
I knew you would love it.

31:22.300 --> 31:24.000
And don't worry
if you didn't get me anything.

31:24.100 --> 31:27.500
Not a big deal. It was just
something to brighten your day.

31:30.100 --> 31:34.000
- I did get you something.
- You didn't forget?

31:34.700 --> 31:39.000
- Two years is hard to forget, Em.
- Okay, where is it?

31:39.300 --> 31:41.900
- Tonight.
- No, come on, please.

31:42.000 --> 31:46.900
What, you just... you wanna know
where it is? Not to open, just to look.

31:47.000 --> 31:48.000
Promise.

31:49.100 --> 31:51.500
Okay, top drawer.

32:16.400 --> 32:18.500
Been waiting a long time
to give you that.

32:23.500 --> 32:26.500
Seems like I've been waiting
since the first day I met you.

32:32.500 --> 32:36.000
Figured what...
what better time than today, you know?

32:40.100 --> 32:41.500
Happy anniversary.

32:44.000 --> 32:45.500
Can I open it?

32:46.400 --> 32:47.500
Tonight.

32:48.900 --> 32:51.000
Can I at least give you an answer?

32:54.500 --> 32:55.500
No.

33:10.900 --> 33:12.000
I have to...

33:18.300 --> 33:21.700
Okay. Looks like, uh,
we're both gonna be working today.

33:21.800 --> 33:23.100
Isn't today your day off?

33:23.200 --> 33:26.500
Yeah, well, accidents don't, uh,
don't take a day off.

33:27.700 --> 33:29.500
Hey, you know what you could do?

33:29.900 --> 33:33.500
- You can make the bed.
- Hmm? What's up?

33:34.500 --> 33:36.200
- I can't...
- Right.

33:36.300 --> 33:37.800
You know what?
I'm already gone, so I can't...

33:37.900 --> 33:42.000
- Yes, um, okay, love you.
- Love you too.

35:54.400 --> 35:55.500
Sorry.

35:57.300 --> 35:59.000
Didn't mean to scare you.

36:02.200 --> 36:05.000
- Do you need to be alone? I can...
- No.

36:07.100 --> 36:08.100
It's all right.

36:12.900 --> 36:14.000
How about a drink?

36:16.500 --> 36:18.500
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

36:21.500 --> 36:23.500
Yeah, we've counted seven so far.

36:24.700 --> 36:26.000
All around the building.

36:26.800 --> 36:30.500
Some closer than others,
and more seem to show up each day.

36:32.300 --> 36:35.000
It's crazy to think that
they might be people we know.

36:36.700 --> 36:38.500
Why aren't we like them?

36:39.800 --> 36:42.500
You know, Julie and I asked ourselves
that same question.

36:45.300 --> 36:48.500
Neither one of us
can think of a logical answer.

36:50.100 --> 36:53.500
So, what's your story?
How'd you end up here at the warehouse?

36:54.400 --> 36:57.500
When I heard the sirens, I headed over
to Robert Benningson's house.

36:57.600 --> 36:59.500
My neighbor across the street.

37:01.600 --> 37:03.500
Door was cracked when I got there.

37:04.200 --> 37:06.000
Something wasn't right
about the whole thing.

37:07.700 --> 37:10.000
We were close with he and his wife,
so I just...

37:10.500 --> 37:13.000
walked in when they didn't respond
to my knocking.

37:14.900 --> 37:17.500
When I got in,
I heard a noise from the back room.

37:18.200 --> 37:20.500
Something I've never heard before.

37:22.600 --> 37:25.000
Curiosity kinda got the best of me so...

37:25.800 --> 37:27.500
I went back there to see what it was.

37:29.300 --> 37:31.000
Opened the door.

37:31.900 --> 37:33.500
And there was Robert.

37:35.900 --> 37:38.000
Then I saw something, I was just...

37:38.800 --> 37:40.000
I'll never forget.

37:42.800 --> 37:47.000
Anyway, I knew he owned this place,
so I grabbed the keys and...

37:47.900 --> 37:49.000
headed here.

37:57.800 --> 38:00.500
I won't keep you. You need some sleep.

38:05.200 --> 38:06.500
What did you see?

38:14.900 --> 38:17.000
What was he doing when you found him?

38:21.300 --> 38:22.500
Eating his wife.

39:03.000 --> 39:06.500
- Hey, Jim, you find anything?
- Yeah, lots of stuff.

39:12.200 --> 39:15.500
- Jesus.
- Look at this.

39:16.700 --> 39:19.000
The answer to all of our problems.

39:20.000 --> 39:22.900
Wow, this stuff has been here a while.

39:23.000 --> 39:27.500
- You find anything in the other rooms?
- Yes, check it out.

39:28.300 --> 39:31.000
Found it in one of the closets.
Maybe if we can run power to it,

39:31.100 --> 39:33.500
then it might pick up
some radio channels from outside.

39:34.200 --> 39:35.500
That's good news, man.

39:36.500 --> 39:40.000
- Well, you hungry?
- Scott, I'm always hungry.

39:40.200 --> 39:42.500
All right, I'll tell Julie
to whip us something up.

39:44.200 --> 39:45.800
You want the soup or the stew?

39:45.900 --> 39:49.000
- I'll have whatever you're having.
- Stew it is.

40:12.700 --> 40:14.000
What are you listening to?

40:15.600 --> 40:16.600
Tape?

40:22.900 --> 40:26.500
- We haven't been introduced, I'm Jim.
- Do I look like I give a shit?

40:30.100 --> 40:31.100
Sorry.

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
Just thought I'd say something.

40:37.600 --> 40:38.700
Trying to be friendly.

40:38.800 --> 40:43.500
Yeah, well, you tried.
Now, can you just leave me alone?

40:44.700 --> 40:46.000
Okay.

41:07.700 --> 41:09.000
Where'd you get that?

41:10.500 --> 41:13.500
- I found it.
- Well, where did you find it?

41:15.100 --> 41:16.500
In the other room.

41:17.800 --> 41:20.000
Was it in a big red bag?

41:24.600 --> 41:26.200
Look, those are my goddamn candy bars.

41:26.300 --> 41:29.500
You take any more, I'll cut
your dick off in your sleep, you got it?

41:35.700 --> 41:37.400
<i>In a press conference
early this morning,</i>

41:37.500 --> 41:39.600
<i>military officials issued a statement
claiming that </i>

41:39.700 --> 41:43.600
<i>the effects of this disaster seem to
have been caused by an airborne agent.</i>

41:43.700 --> 41:47.300
<i>Either chemical or viral,
and most likely one that was engineered.</i>

41:47.400 --> 41:50.100
<i>Scientists have determined that
the agent was most likely released</i>

41:50.200 --> 41:52.900
<i>in the explosion which occurred
in the western part of the county</i>

41:53.000 --> 41:54.300
<i>just a few days ago.</i>

41:54.400 --> 41:58.400
<i>Now, the big question on everyone's mind
is: What was the cause of the explosion?</i>

41:58.500 --> 42:00.500
It's gotta be the chemical factory.

42:00.800 --> 42:03.500
I can't think of anything else
that could be behind this.

42:04.400 --> 42:08.500
- What are you ranting about over there?
- TV said there was an explosion.

42:08.600 --> 42:12.000
- Yeah, so?
- So, that black cloud we saw...

42:12.700 --> 42:15.000
That was in the direction
of Reseda County, right?

42:15.100 --> 42:16.100
Yeah.

42:16.700 --> 42:18.100
That side of the county just happens to be

42:18.200 --> 42:21.500
the home of one of the largest chemical
weapons factories in the country.

42:22.100 --> 42:23.500
Jesus.

42:25.100 --> 42:27.200
Probably used to make
nerve agents and stuff, right?

42:27.300 --> 42:29.700
Yeah, nerve agents, chemical weapons.

42:29.800 --> 42:33.400
They shut it down in the 80s. Poured all
those chemicals into huge holding tanks.

42:33.500 --> 42:38.000
- Said they were unstable or something.
- They didn't shut it down good enough.

42:39.200 --> 42:40.500
Yeah.

42:42.800 --> 42:44.000
Got one.

42:44.400 --> 42:47.500
- Where?
- Just south of the water tower.

42:55.700 --> 42:59.500
- Where do they keep coming from?
- I don't know.

43:00.300 --> 43:03.500
As long as they're out there,
then that's all I care about.

43:07.200 --> 43:09.500
What I would do is
just take 'em all out, right now.

43:14.500 --> 43:20.500
- How many does that make?
- Eleven, not counting the south side.

43:20.600 --> 43:23.900
- Scott, honey?
- Yeah.

43:24.000 --> 43:26.500
Would you mind bringing down
more water? We're running low.

43:27.500 --> 43:30.500
- Sure, honey.
- Thank you.

43:33.900 --> 43:36.500
Even in the apocalypse,
she's got me doing chores.

45:00.800 --> 45:04.800
<i>...But what you failed to mention,
was what the situation is.</i>

45:04.900 --> 45:07.700
<i>We have been receiving phone calls
all day from people around the country,</i>

45:07.800 --> 45:11.500
<i>simply asking, as if we, the media,
knew what was going on...</i>

45:22.300 --> 45:24.500
I didn't take any more
of your candy bars.

45:25.600 --> 45:30.500
- No, man, couldn't sleep.
- Join the club.

45:32.300 --> 45:33.500
What's that?

45:35.300 --> 45:36.500
Nothing.

45:38.300 --> 45:40.500
- Want to sit?
- Next to you?

45:41.600 --> 45:42.600
No.

45:44.000 --> 45:45.000
Fine.

45:57.300 --> 46:02.000
It's Alix. Most people just call me Ix.

46:03.800 --> 46:05.500
- Al-Ix.
- Oh.

46:10.600 --> 46:12.000
Who is she?

46:12.800 --> 46:14.500
Her name was Emilie.

46:15.500 --> 46:16.500
Can I see?

46:23.500 --> 46:27.000
She's pretty. What happened?

46:34.600 --> 46:36.500
I don't really wanna talk about her.

46:39.300 --> 46:42.500
So, what happened to you?
What's your story?

46:44.700 --> 46:46.500
It's complicated.

46:47.100 --> 46:49.500
It's complicated
or you just don't wanna talk about it?

46:49.600 --> 46:53.500
It's complicated
and I don't wanna talk about it.

46:55.300 --> 46:56.500
Okay.

47:10.300 --> 47:11.500
I, uh...

47:14.100 --> 47:17.500
had to move back in with my parents
about a year ago.

47:19.400 --> 47:22.000
Living in the city
wasn't exactly working out.

47:22.800 --> 47:28.800
I, uh, couldn't get a job,
had no friends, no money.

47:30.600 --> 47:34.900
And, uh,
my parents gave my old room back.

47:35.000 --> 47:37.500
Yeah, like until I got on my feet but...

47:38.800 --> 47:40.500
that didn't last for long.

47:42.700 --> 47:45.700
I came home one night,

47:45.800 --> 47:51.000
and they sat me down, and they said
they didn't approve of my behavior.

47:52.400 --> 47:55.000
I stormed out
and I stopped talking to them.

47:55.600 --> 48:00.000
And now I can't even tell 'em I'm sorry.

48:02.900 --> 48:06.000
I can't even tell 'em
that I actually love them.

48:09.100 --> 48:12.000
I was a terrible daughter.

48:12.900 --> 48:18.000
Hey, hey. It's okay,
it's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

48:19.400 --> 48:21.000
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

48:21.800 --> 48:27.000
Besides, you're not the only one that
feels like they don't have any friends.

48:28.800 --> 48:32.000
This may come as some of a shock to you,

48:34.100 --> 48:36.500
Emilie was the only friend that I had.

48:38.600 --> 48:43.000
Just a week ago,
I had my whole life figured out.

48:44.100 --> 48:47.500
I was gonna ask the girl
that I love to marry me.

48:49.900 --> 48:52.000
Move out of this town.

48:54.500 --> 48:56.500
Start a new job.

48:57.700 --> 49:00.500
And make those friends, you know?

49:03.400 --> 49:05.000
Instead, I'm...

49:05.900 --> 49:07.000
hiding...

49:08.000 --> 49:10.500
for my life, in a warehouse.

49:19.100 --> 49:22.000
And I lost the only friend that I had.

49:27.900 --> 49:30.000
Maybe we could be friends.

49:36.700 --> 49:38.000
I'd like that.

49:56.800 --> 49:58.000
Came from the back door.

50:09.300 --> 50:12.000
Jim... Jim...

50:12.300 --> 50:15.500
- What should we do?
- Go upstairs and lock the door.

50:15.600 --> 50:17.600
You don't open the door unless
you hear our voices from the outside.

50:17.700 --> 50:19.100
- Do you understand?
- Yeah.

50:19.200 --> 50:20.200
Go now!

50:32.300 --> 50:33.500
So, what do you think?

50:35.100 --> 50:36.500
Stay here.

50:47.100 --> 50:48.100
What do you see?

50:50.300 --> 50:52.000
I don't see anybody.

51:10.700 --> 51:12.000
Please let me in.

51:13.800 --> 51:17.000
What's your name?
Where did you come from?

51:18.600 --> 51:22.000
I'm looking for my daughter.
Have you seen her?

51:22.800 --> 51:27.500
- No.
- Please let me in. I need to come in.

51:28.600 --> 51:30.000
What do you think? Should we let her in?

51:33.300 --> 51:34.500
We should let her in.

51:37.300 --> 51:42.400
Where did you come from?
Have you seen any of those things?

51:42.500 --> 51:47.500
I came from town. I managed
to get pass them. Please let me come in.

51:48.300 --> 51:52.000
- Something's not right with her.
- Would you be if you're out there?

51:54.400 --> 51:55.800
- Give me the flashlight.
- What?

51:55.900 --> 51:57.000
Give it to me.

52:05.300 --> 52:07.000
Your eyes.

52:07.700 --> 52:09.500
Please let me come in.

52:10.400 --> 52:13.400
- Get outta here or we'll shoot!
- Let me in!

52:13.500 --> 52:15.500
- Shoot her, Jim.
- Get outta here, right now!

52:15.600 --> 52:19.000
- Let me in!
- Shoot her, Jim. Shoot her!

52:24.500 --> 52:26.400
<i>At approximately 6:30 this morning,</i>

52:26.500 --> 52:29.900
<i>a small battalion of marines was
deployed on a search-and-rescue mission</i>

52:30.000 --> 52:32.200
<i>on the western borders
of Montgomery County.</i>

52:32.300 --> 52:34.200
<i>They believe that
the process will be slow,</i>

52:34.300 --> 52:37.000
<i>but are determined
to find any survivors.</i>

52:40.900 --> 52:42.000
Hey.

52:43.700 --> 52:45.000
Hi.

52:45.300 --> 52:50.000
TV says they sent out a search team. I
don't know what that means for us but...

52:50.700 --> 52:53.500
- It's good news.
- Yeah.

52:54.900 --> 52:58.500
Um, look, I just wanted to say
thank you, for last night.

52:58.700 --> 53:01.000
Appreciated your comfort.

53:01.900 --> 53:06.000
Not exactly used to people
listening to my problems, so thank you.

53:07.600 --> 53:10.000
- You're welcome.
- Cool.

53:26.800 --> 53:31.400
<i>And we're continuing to see more
and more airdrops fall from the skies</i>

53:31.500 --> 53:35.000
<i>over Montgomery County.
Now, each one of these airdrops</i>

53:35.200 --> 53:40.000
<i>is filled with food, water and, uh,
other survival gear...</i>

53:45.700 --> 53:47.500
Raptor, do you copy me?

53:49.600 --> 53:51.000
Raptor, copy.

53:52.400 --> 53:54.316
Heading 257.

54:05.000 --> 54:06.500
I'm out of candy bars.

54:10.300 --> 54:11.500
You okay?

54:11.900 --> 54:15.500
Um, yeah, I'm just
a little bit flustered, that's all.

54:15.900 --> 54:20.000
Jim! Jim, get down here!

54:33.000 --> 54:34.000
What is it?

54:35.800 --> 54:38.500
- It just started going off.
- ...27259.

54:40.900 --> 54:41.700
Copy that.

54:41.800 --> 54:45.000
There-there was nothing and then...
voices.

54:45.500 --> 54:47.500
Anybody got eyes on Raptor?

54:48.800 --> 54:51.500
Yeah, we're-we're
actually en route right now.

54:53.200 --> 54:55.401
What's your, uh, current heading?

54:56.000 --> 54:59.000
- What is that?
- Heading 270, over.

54:59.100 --> 55:00.900
- Copy that, heading 270.
- Turn it off.

55:01.000 --> 55:04.000
- What?
- I said turn it off.

55:06.000 --> 55:07.500
What the hell did you do that for?

55:25.200 --> 55:28.500
- What is it?
- Helicopters. We're going home!

55:38.500 --> 55:39.500
I can see 'em!

55:43.200 --> 55:45.500
They're too far away.
They can't see the sign.

55:50.100 --> 55:51.500
The hell with this.

55:52.100 --> 55:54.500
Scott. Scott, no!

56:16.100 --> 56:19.000
Scott! Scott, no!

56:20.100 --> 56:21.100
Hey!

56:22.200 --> 56:25.000
Help! Hey! Down here!

56:25.900 --> 56:28.000
Scott, get back inside!

56:28.300 --> 56:31.500
Help! Hey! Down here!

57:06.100 --> 57:09.500
Scott!

57:17.700 --> 57:19.000
Shit.

58:30.600 --> 58:33.000
What the hell were you thinking
out there?

58:33.200 --> 58:35.500
You saw the helicopters.
I was just trying to get...

58:35.600 --> 58:40.500
I don't give a shit what you were
trying to do, Scott! You put us at risk!

58:40.600 --> 58:43.300
Not to mention how many of those things
probably saw that we were in here.

58:43.400 --> 58:46.300
Hey! Who the hell put you in charge?

58:46.400 --> 58:48.900
Remember it was us that invited you here.

58:49.000 --> 58:51.000
We were doing just fine without you.

58:51.600 --> 58:54.000
We give you food, water.

58:55.200 --> 58:57.000
- I'll do whatever I want.
- Ix.

58:57.300 --> 58:59.000
I was trying to get us out of here.

59:03.600 --> 59:06.000
Hey, guys!
There's something wrong with Ix!

59:06.700 --> 59:08.000
What's wrong with her?

59:14.700 --> 59:17.100
- What's wrong with her?
- I don't know.

59:17.200 --> 59:18.800
- Goddammit, get away from her!
- Get the hell offa me!

59:18.900 --> 59:20.500
Quit it, you guys!

59:21.100 --> 59:24.000
Alix... Alix...

59:24.600 --> 59:26.000
Is she dead?

59:27.700 --> 59:30.100
- She's in shock.
- Way to go, "doctor."

59:30.200 --> 59:33.000
- Is she sick?
- No.

59:33.100 --> 59:35.000
Um, then, what is it?

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:15.000
- How is she doing?
- Not good. Barely spoken a word.

01:00:21.400 --> 01:00:23.000
So, what do we do now, Jim?

01:00:24.900 --> 01:00:29.500
I don't know. We don't know how long
we're gonna be here until help arrives.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:32.500
Could be weeks.

01:00:33.400 --> 01:00:37.000
Well, I'm aware of that,
but it doesn't help our situation.

01:00:41.600 --> 01:00:45.000
- Then, I'll go get some.
- That's crazy.

01:00:45.500 --> 01:00:47.800
The nearest drugstore
is on the other side of town.

01:00:47.900 --> 01:00:51.500
I go and get the medicine.
I come back. I'll be back by sundown.

01:00:51.600 --> 01:00:53.000
You will never make it.

01:01:00.400 --> 01:01:02.000
What about the airdrop?

01:01:03.500 --> 01:01:04.500
What?

01:01:04.800 --> 01:01:08.400
The airdrop.
TV said that they had medicine in them.

01:01:08.500 --> 01:01:11.500
Surely they would have insulin, right?

01:01:12.800 --> 01:01:14.500
What's she talking about?

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:18.500
What airdrop?

01:01:20.700 --> 01:01:22.300
Before we saw your light in the barn,

01:01:22.400 --> 01:01:25.600
we saw planes fly over, dropping things
out of the back, attached to parachutes.

01:01:25.700 --> 01:01:28.700
Thought it was just supplies
or something, but didn't really care.

01:01:28.800 --> 01:01:31.400
- It was too far away to concern us.
- Where'd they drop it?

01:01:31.500 --> 01:01:34.000
Uh, just to the southwest of us,
over in this area.

01:01:34.700 --> 01:01:36.300
Couldn't be more than a mile or so away.

01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:37.500
Then, that's it.

01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:42.000
Jim, it's suicide. We wouldn't make it
pass all those things.

01:01:42.300 --> 01:01:44.000
- Then, I'll go alone.
- Jim.

01:01:44.100 --> 01:01:46.500
Look, I'll grab what I can,
and I'll come back.

01:01:47.900 --> 01:01:50.500
I can't just sit here
and watch her die.

01:01:57.500 --> 01:01:59.500
I'll need you to clear me a path.

01:02:02.900 --> 01:02:04.500
Think you can handle that?

01:02:05.200 --> 01:02:09.000
I'll do what I can, but once you're over
that hill, you're on your own.

01:02:37.700 --> 01:02:40.600
Just remember, if you get into trouble
with those things, don't run.

01:02:40.700 --> 01:02:42.400
It'll only draw more attention
to yourself.

01:02:42.500 --> 01:02:44.000
Thanks for reminding me.

01:02:44.100 --> 01:02:46.100
Now, you only have about
another 40 minutes of sunlight,

01:02:46.200 --> 01:02:48.700
so I suggest you get what you need
and hurry back.

01:02:48.800 --> 01:02:54.000
- Okay. Any other advice?
- Yeah, don't die.

01:03:15.200 --> 01:03:17.000
All right, all set down there?

01:03:17.600 --> 01:03:20.500
- Ready when you are.
- All right, here we go.

01:04:20.300 --> 01:04:21.300
Shit.

01:04:37.700 --> 01:04:39.000
Go!

01:05:34.700 --> 01:05:36.000
Scott.

01:05:37.800 --> 01:05:39.000
Scotty.

01:08:14.800 --> 01:08:18.500
What's your location? Jim. Jim!

01:08:19.800 --> 01:08:21.500
Jim, can you hear me?

01:08:22.600 --> 01:08:24.000
Jim, come in.

01:08:45.300 --> 01:08:46.500
Shit.

01:10:52.600 --> 01:10:54.000
How is she?

01:10:54.800 --> 01:10:59.500
I think she's gonna be okay.
She just needs some rest.

01:11:00.200 --> 01:11:03.000
So, how do you know so much
about this stuff anyway?

01:11:03.500 --> 01:11:06.000
my fiance, Emilie, was a nurse.

01:11:08.400 --> 01:11:12.000
Guess I just picked up a few things
along the way.

01:11:12.700 --> 01:11:14.500
It's a good thing you did.

01:11:19.400 --> 01:11:22.500
Mmm, so good.

01:11:24.300 --> 01:11:26.500
I don't know how much more
of that canned stuff I could take.

01:11:27.100 --> 01:11:29.500
Better not let Julie hear you say that.

01:11:37.600 --> 01:11:40.000
I never said anything, but...

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:45.000
I'm gonna let you know that I really
appreciate what you did back there.

01:11:45.700 --> 01:11:48.500
You know, when you had my back
when that thing attacked me.

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:55.500
- You would've done the same thing.
- Uh, I'm not so sure I would have.

01:11:57.400 --> 01:12:00.000
I was just so scared out there.

01:12:00.300 --> 01:12:04.000
You know, my muscles
just stopped working. I froze.

01:12:07.600 --> 01:12:09.000
You, on the other hand...

01:12:11.100 --> 01:12:15.000
You've got something I don't.
I mean, you reacted.

01:12:17.400 --> 01:12:19.000
You saved my life.

01:12:25.600 --> 01:12:27.000
Well, I'm gonna turn in.

01:12:29.300 --> 01:12:33.000
Been a long day of
"nothing to look forward to."

01:12:40.600 --> 01:12:42.000
Good night, Scott.

01:12:44.800 --> 01:12:46.000
Good night, buddy.

01:13:01.400 --> 01:13:05.000
- What happened?
- Welcome back.

01:13:07.200 --> 01:13:11.000
I was having the worst nightmare.

01:13:11.400 --> 01:13:14.500
Can't be any worse than
the nightmare we're having right now.

01:13:17.900 --> 01:13:19.500
How're you feeling?

01:13:20.800 --> 01:13:23.000
All right, I guess.

01:13:25.900 --> 01:13:28.000
Should've told us, Alix.

01:13:28.800 --> 01:13:30.500
You had us worried.

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:34.500
You had me worried.

01:13:36.400 --> 01:13:38.000
Sorry.

01:13:39.200 --> 01:13:40.500
It's okay.

01:13:46.500 --> 01:13:49.000
She was lucky to have you.

01:13:54.100 --> 01:13:56.000
I was lucky to have her.

01:14:02.200 --> 01:14:04.500
- You need anything?
- No.

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:06.000
You sure?

01:14:07.700 --> 01:14:09.000
Yeah.

01:14:10.600 --> 01:14:16.000
Okay then, go back to bed.
You need a lot more rest.

01:14:16.500 --> 01:14:20.000
- We'll talk again at breakfast, okay?
- Okay.

01:14:20.500 --> 01:14:21.500
Okay.

01:16:42.700 --> 01:16:44.000
Jim?

01:17:08.800 --> 01:17:10.500
Julie, get outta here!

01:17:11.800 --> 01:17:14.000
Jim! Jim! Go get Ix!

01:17:22.700 --> 01:17:26.000
- Go! I'm behind you!
- Okay!

01:21:58.600 --> 01:22:00.000
Say something.

01:22:03.600 --> 01:22:05.000
Say something!

01:22:07.500 --> 01:22:08.500
Hi.

01:22:55.400 --> 01:23:01.000
Uh, apparently, the chemical plant
was the cause of all of this.

01:23:02.100 --> 01:23:06.000
A cooler in one of the holding tanks
malfunctioned.

01:23:06.500 --> 01:23:09.700
The chemicals were very aggressive
on the nervous system, but it...

01:23:09.800 --> 01:23:12.500
it didn't seem to have the same effect
on everyone.

01:23:14.100 --> 01:23:16.500
I am sure there were survivors.

01:23:18.400 --> 01:23:22.000
But, they couldn't defend themselves
long enough to be rescued.

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:29.000
A search beacon was activated
when you opened the airdrop.

01:23:30.100 --> 01:23:34.000
And a helicopter
full of marines was deployed.

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:41.000
If it hadn't been for your bravery,
we might not have found you.

01:23:43.100 --> 01:23:49.000
We, uh, we've done a lot of tests
and bloodwork, and...

01:23:49.500 --> 01:23:55.000
we've decided that there's no reason
for us to detain you and the others.

01:23:56.300 --> 01:23:59.500
I am really sorry
for what you guys have gone through.

01:24:01.100 --> 01:24:04.500
We're gonna do everything we can
to get you back on your feet.

01:24:11.400 --> 01:24:13.000
Do you have any questions?

01:24:17.900 --> 01:24:19.500
Where are my friends?
