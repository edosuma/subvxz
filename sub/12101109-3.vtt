00:09.940 --> 00:11.701
Operation Lighthouse.

00:11.735 --> 00:16.740
The Unsolved murder of Gail
Vella on September 10th, 2019.

00:19.295 --> 00:21.331
Mr. Boyle,
did you shoot Gail Vella?

00:22.919 --> 00:25.473
A significant number
of other fingerprints

00:25.508 --> 00:30.306
match an individual identified
by the Police National Computer
as Carl Banks.

00:30.340 --> 00:32.515
Carl Banks has an
extensive history of violence.

00:34.482 --> 00:36.657
What is the motive for
Gail Vella's murder?

00:36.691 --> 00:38.555
All right, She's a
controversial journalist.

00:38.590 --> 00:40.695
But there's no evidence to
suggest that she dug up anything

00:40.730 --> 00:41.903
that wasn't there before.

00:41.938 --> 00:43.664
Maybe she was working
on something that would.

00:46.736 --> 00:48.324
She keep notes or recordings?

00:48.358 --> 00:50.188
What journalist wouldn't?

00:50.222 --> 00:52.190
That's why I suggested Gail's
killer must have stolen them.

00:54.744 --> 00:57.505
I accepted the
disciplinary action, ma'am.

00:57.540 --> 00:59.749
There's plenty think you're
lucky not to have been removed.

01:02.614 --> 01:05.134
Farida's replacement.
PC Ryan...?

01:05.168 --> 01:06.514
Uh, Pilkington, ma'am.

01:06.549 --> 01:07.895
Have we worked together before?

01:11.312 --> 01:13.728
Our assumption is the removal

01:13.763 --> 01:15.489
of a refrigerator or freezer.

01:15.523 --> 01:17.249
What happened
to this appliance?

01:19.458 --> 01:20.563
Steph, what are you doing here?

01:20.597 --> 01:22.565
You promised you'd
call me back. It's HMRC.

01:22.599 --> 01:24.946
Not here.
Let's go somewhere quiet.

01:24.981 --> 01:26.879
It's good you were able
to keep the house.

01:26.914 --> 01:28.674
Fortunately there was
John's life insurance.

01:34.991 --> 01:37.752
I can't share any details, but
we might be looking into Vella.

01:37.787 --> 01:39.927
Great, so either I'm
accused of being a traitor

01:39.961 --> 01:42.826
or I become one to
avoid being accused.

01:42.861 --> 01:44.518
We really can't be sure about

01:44.552 --> 01:45.622
the loyalty of some
of these people.

01:48.453 --> 01:50.593
-It's over.
Don't go.

01:51.628 --> 01:52.664
Is everything okay?

01:53.665 --> 01:54.907
-I should...
-Yeah.

01:57.255 --> 01:58.877
How do you account for these
devices being found hidden

01:58.911 --> 01:59.774
in your home?

02:00.982 --> 02:02.501
-I'm being framed!
-Who's framing you?

02:02.536 --> 02:04.158
Jo, it's Jo Davidson.

02:10.613 --> 02:12.442
Right, is she prepared
to give a statement?

02:13.719 --> 02:15.376
Brilliant, yeah,
sooner the better.

02:16.343 --> 02:17.378
Cheers, mate.

02:20.864 --> 02:21.934
Bingo.

02:24.868 --> 02:26.422
Ma'am.
Boss.

02:26.456 --> 02:28.286
Alastair Oldroyd,
the CHIS who claimed he got

02:28.320 --> 02:30.391
into a row with
Gail Vella's murderer.

02:30.426 --> 02:32.359
I've been pissing in the wind,
going around all the likely pubs

02:32.393 --> 02:34.430
looking for a witness
to Oldroyd's story.

02:34.464 --> 02:35.569
What you got, Chris?

02:35.603 --> 02:38.848
One of our uniforms
has got a Deborah ...vereux,

02:38.882 --> 02:40.643
which I'm bound
to be pronouncing wrong.

02:40.677 --> 02:43.266
Claims she witnessed an argument
on the night of the 26th

02:43.301 --> 02:45.406
involving a man matching
Alastair Oldroyd's description.

02:46.545 --> 02:49.238
And she saw who Oldroyd
was arguing with?

02:49.272 --> 02:50.549
That's what she's
claiming, ma'am.

03:00.318 --> 03:01.767
<i>Deborah,
according to a first account</i>

03:01.802 --> 03:03.700
<i>you gave earlier today,</i>

03:03.735 --> 03:06.772
<i>you were in the Red Lion pub
on Francis Road, Moss Heath</i>

03:06.807 --> 03:09.189
<i>on the night of the 26th of
October. Is that correct?</i>

03:09.844 --> 03:11.605
<i>Yeah, that's right.</i>

03:11.639 --> 03:13.641
<i>You witnessed an argument
between how many persons?</i>

03:14.366 --> 03:16.541
<i>Two men.</i>

03:16.575 --> 03:19.751
<i>For the recording, I'm
showing the witness Image 43.</i>

03:19.785 --> 03:22.685
Image 43 is a person
known to our inquiry.

03:24.480 --> 03:26.067
Is this one of the men you saw?

03:26.102 --> 03:28.932
Yeah, definitely.

03:28.967 --> 03:30.486
Do you know this man's name?

03:32.281 --> 03:33.489
Sorry.

03:33.523 --> 03:37.044
Deborah, I'm gonna show you
a photograph of another man.

03:37.078 --> 03:39.805
For the recording,
this is Image 29.

03:39.840 --> 03:41.807
Deborah, please look
closely at Image 29.

03:42.601 --> 03:43.671
Take your time.

03:44.776 --> 03:46.640
Did you see this man
in the Red Lion

03:46.674 --> 03:48.331
on the night of the
26th of October?

03:49.401 --> 03:50.402
Sorry.

03:51.679 --> 03:53.957
Just to confirm, this is
not the man you witnessed

03:53.992 --> 03:56.822
in an argument with the person
shown in the previous image?

03:57.409 --> 03:58.617
He looked, erm...

04:00.101 --> 04:01.448
different.

04:04.313 --> 04:06.487
Different different?

04:06.522 --> 04:08.869
<i>Yeah. Sorry,
am I not allowed to say that?</i>

04:08.903 --> 04:11.596
<i>No, that's okay.</i>

04:11.630 --> 04:15.669
Set up a video ID parade and
pull the new evidence together.

04:15.703 --> 04:18.499
We'll bring Terry Boyle
back in tomorrow.

04:18.534 --> 04:20.121
<i>The Police
and Criminal Evidence Act</i>

04:20.156 --> 04:22.883
<i>forbids me from showing you
a photo of the suspect.</i>

04:22.917 --> 04:24.022
<i>We would require...</i>

04:40.072 --> 04:41.729
Mind your head as you get out.

04:45.388 --> 04:46.493
Just heading over here.

04:52.499 --> 04:53.983
Terry Boyle in for interview.

04:54.017 --> 04:55.536
Need to sign him in
and allocate a room.

04:55.571 --> 04:56.641
Wait there.

04:58.608 --> 04:59.851
You know, I'm still your
best mate, Terry.

05:00.645 --> 05:02.578
Everything's gonna be fine.

05:02.612 --> 05:04.062
As long as you
keep your mouth shut.

05:09.757 --> 05:12.035
Terry Boyle, you remain
under caution.

05:12.070 --> 05:14.521
You do not have to say anything,
but it may harm your defence

05:14.555 --> 05:16.108
if you do not mention
when questioned

05:16.143 --> 05:18.007
something you later
rely on in court.

05:19.905 --> 05:22.149
I'm showing Image 43.

05:22.183 --> 05:24.427
This is a picture
of Alastair Oldroyd.

05:25.152 --> 05:26.567
Do you know this man?

05:27.948 --> 05:29.121
No.

05:31.607 --> 05:35.783
We have a witness in this
inquiry we're calling Witness A.

05:35.818 --> 05:38.855
Witness A described
seeing Alastair Oldroyd

05:38.890 --> 05:41.513
in the company of a young
white male with dark hair.

05:42.825 --> 05:44.516
Earlier today, Witness A

05:44.551 --> 05:46.725
completed a video
identification parade.

05:47.933 --> 05:49.556
In the presence
of your solicitor,

05:49.590 --> 05:53.836
Witness A was shown videos of
nine men of similar appearance.

05:53.870 --> 05:57.874
Your solicitor will confirm
that Witness A identified you

05:57.909 --> 06:01.878
as the person she states was in
the company of Alastair Oldroyd

06:01.913 --> 06:06.124
at the Red Lion public house,
Francis Road, Moss Heath,

06:06.158 --> 06:09.748
on the night
of the 26th of October.

06:09.783 --> 06:13.407
So, Terry, what DCI Davidson
is saying is somebody saw you

06:13.442 --> 06:16.583
in a pub on that
particular night.

06:16.617 --> 06:18.654
And in that particular pub

06:18.688 --> 06:21.933
on that particular night,
the witness claims

06:21.967 --> 06:25.005
you were with this man,
Alastair Oldroyd.

06:28.560 --> 06:29.872
Were you with him?

06:35.533 --> 06:38.052
You're not answering.
That's your right.

06:39.640 --> 06:41.780
My client is fully cooperative
with your investigation,

06:41.815 --> 06:43.506
DCI Davidson.

06:43.541 --> 06:45.715
As you know, sometimes Mr Boyle

06:45.750 --> 06:48.028
finds it difficult
to formulate an answer.

06:48.062 --> 06:51.031
Particularly in situations
of stress.

06:51.065 --> 06:54.137
We have information on the
conversation you're alleged

06:54.172 --> 06:55.691
to have had with
Alastair Oldroyd

06:55.725 --> 06:57.658
on the night of the
26th of October.

06:59.108 --> 07:00.868
Did you confess to
Alastair Oldroyd

07:00.903 --> 07:03.492
that you'd been involved
in the murder of Gail Vella?

07:05.252 --> 07:09.152
Is what DCI Davidson
said true, Terry?

07:09.187 --> 07:12.811
Did you talk to Alastair Oldroyd
about Gail Vella?

07:14.503 --> 07:15.573
Not me.

07:18.576 --> 07:20.163
Sorry, Terry,
I don't understand.

07:20.198 --> 07:21.717
What do you mean, not me?

07:23.235 --> 07:24.927
Take your time.

07:24.961 --> 07:27.481
It sounds like this
could be important information.

07:31.899 --> 07:34.626
DI Fleming's question was,
when you say "Not me"

07:34.661 --> 07:36.973
we don't understand
what you mean.

07:37.008 --> 07:38.527
Can you help us
with that, please?

07:39.907 --> 07:44.256
The other man, he did it.

07:47.605 --> 07:49.986
There was another man with you
and Alastair Oldroyd?

07:54.163 --> 07:56.993
According to our witness,
there was just the two of you.

07:58.788 --> 07:59.858
No.

08:02.033 --> 08:03.966
Terry, are you trying to say

08:04.000 --> 08:06.486
there was another man who
talked about Gail Vella?

08:06.969 --> 08:08.039
Stay calm.

08:09.074 --> 08:10.144
Take your time.

08:11.249 --> 08:12.630
Terry, this other man.

08:12.664 --> 08:14.908
Did he talk about how
Gail Vella was killed?

08:18.083 --> 08:19.671
Who was this other man, Terry?

08:22.881 --> 08:24.918
I'm concerned about
your client's welfare.

08:26.678 --> 08:28.611
Terry, did this man
threaten you?

08:28.646 --> 08:30.958
Because if he did,
we can protect you.

08:30.993 --> 08:33.236
You just need to tell us
who this other man is.

08:36.136 --> 08:37.240
We have to stop.

08:38.241 --> 08:40.520
-We're getting somewhere--
-Kate!

08:41.866 --> 08:44.006
Let's leave it there for today.

08:44.040 --> 08:45.973
We'll continue another time.

08:46.008 --> 08:48.873
Terry, you should get some rest.

08:54.257 --> 08:57.019
Interview terminated
at 3:38 P.M.

09:05.993 --> 09:08.133
Terry was claiming there was
someone else involved.

09:08.168 --> 09:10.308
That fits with him being
substituted for Carl Banks.

09:10.342 --> 09:12.655
We've got a witness
saying it's Terry with Oldroyd.

09:12.690 --> 09:14.139
No mention of Banks at all.

09:14.174 --> 09:16.245
He was just about to say
who's behind the swap.

09:16.279 --> 09:17.487
Kate!

09:17.522 --> 09:20.801
You've got used to nicking
coppers. They know the system.

09:20.836 --> 09:23.217
You can get tough as you like
on them, pretty much.

09:23.252 --> 09:25.081
If we go to court,
I guarantee you

09:25.116 --> 09:27.359
the defence will claim we
oppressed and intimidated

09:27.394 --> 09:30.604
a vulnerable suspect
into incriminating himself.

09:30.639 --> 09:32.986
Show a jury the video of us
carrying on at Terry Boyle,

09:33.020 --> 09:35.816
and that could be the whole
trial collapsing right there.

09:35.851 --> 09:37.611
I know what I'm doing.

09:37.646 --> 09:39.855
And I got you in the room
because I thought you did, too.

09:41.857 --> 09:42.927
Sorry, boss.

10:00.910 --> 10:04.465
<i>When you say "Not me" we don't understand what you mean.</i>

10:04.500 --> 10:06.260
<i>Can you help us
with that, please?</i>

10:06.295 --> 10:08.159
T <i>he other man...</i>

10:09.091 --> 10:10.333
<i>He did it.</i>

10:13.820 --> 10:15.442
<i>The other man...</i>

10:17.064 --> 10:18.307
<i>He did it.</i>

10:20.930 --> 10:23.450
<i>There was another man with you and Alastair Oldroyd?</i>

10:31.044 --> 10:33.149
Careful, Terry.
Mind your head.

10:59.279 --> 11:02.006
Alright, Terry?
Won't be a long drive, mate.

11:03.801 --> 11:05.147
Got the new route
for tonight, yeah?

11:05.181 --> 11:07.080
No one said a thing to me.

11:07.114 --> 11:08.426
Sorry about that, Lisa.

11:08.460 --> 11:11.015
It's all for Terry's security.
We vary the route.

11:11.843 --> 11:12.913
I'll find it.

11:33.831 --> 11:35.039
<i>Ma'am?</i>

11:35.073 --> 11:37.075
Hi, Chris. Sorry to bother you.
I'm just double checking

11:37.110 --> 11:39.526
Terry Boyle's being returned to
his approved premises tonight?

11:39.560 --> 11:40.941
<i>Stand by.</i>

11:42.978 --> 11:44.427
- <i>Ma'am?
-Yeah?</i>

11:44.462 --> 11:46.188
<i>Yeah, just checked.
That's correct</i>

11:46.222 --> 11:49.087
<i>Approved premises tonight.
Resume interview tomorrow.</i>

11:49.122 --> 11:50.157
<i>You still in the station?</i>

11:50.192 --> 11:52.021
No, I had to nip out
for something.

11:52.056 --> 11:52.953
Speak to you in a bit.

11:52.988 --> 11:54.472
-Thanks, Chris.
- <i>Cheers, ma'am.</i>

12:15.631 --> 12:17.081
Terry's nodded off, bless him.

12:18.427 --> 12:19.808
Okay to open my window?

12:19.842 --> 12:20.947
No probs.

12:27.160 --> 12:28.264
Come on.

12:33.442 --> 12:35.478
-Sorry, Lisa, what's our ETA?

13:06.509 --> 13:07.579
Shit.

13:24.527 --> 13:25.805
Help!

13:35.538 --> 13:39.059
Shit. Status, Zero,
Mike, India, 3-7.

13:39.094 --> 13:41.648
Edge Park Reservoir,
officers in water.

14:12.472 --> 14:16.027
Help's coming! It's DI Fleming!
I've called for backup.

14:16.062 --> 14:17.995
Help, ma'am, help!

14:18.029 --> 14:19.375
It's all right, I've got you.

14:22.447 --> 14:23.621
You're okay.

14:24.518 --> 14:25.899
You all right, Terry?

14:29.006 --> 14:30.248
The driver's still under.

14:31.456 --> 14:33.424
It's too dangerous!

14:33.458 --> 14:34.943
Just wait for backup!

14:34.977 --> 14:39.257
Status, Zero, Mike, India, 3-7
at Edge Park Reservoir.

14:39.292 --> 14:42.122
One officer missing,
one in water.

14:42.157 --> 14:44.400
Request urgent backup
and divers.

14:44.435 --> 14:46.713
<i>Received, 3-7. Units en route.</i>

15:12.635 --> 15:13.705
Oh my God.

15:14.741 --> 15:16.087
Kate, are you all right?

15:16.122 --> 15:17.571
Yeah. I'm in one piece, boss.

15:19.539 --> 15:20.747
No.

15:21.644 --> 15:22.680
Lisa.

15:27.823 --> 15:29.445
Have you got everything
you need, Chris?

15:29.480 --> 15:31.447
I've got your first account,
ma'am, that should be fine.

15:33.035 --> 15:34.554
All right if l go
and look at the car?

15:36.521 --> 15:37.729
Thank God you were passing.

15:38.627 --> 15:40.249
Yeah, pure coincidence.

16:14.249 --> 16:15.733
I'll be at the car, boss,
if you need me.

16:44.210 --> 16:45.418
-Yeah?

16:51.286 --> 16:53.598
DI Arnott, you told me we
had a new source,

16:53.633 --> 16:55.531
but you did not tell me who.

16:55.566 --> 16:57.257
I wanted you to hear
it from Kate, sir.

16:58.707 --> 17:00.260
-Kate.
-Sir.

17:02.400 --> 17:04.057
Go on.

17:04.092 --> 17:05.369
Tonight I believe there was
an attempt

17:05.403 --> 17:06.853
on Terry Boyle's life, sir.

17:09.269 --> 17:11.271
It could only have happened
with leaks from

17:11.306 --> 17:14.205
and-or collusion with members
of DCI Davidson's team.

17:15.482 --> 17:17.243
My first duty
as a police officer

17:17.277 --> 17:19.728
is preservation of life, sir.
That's why I'm here.

17:23.111 --> 17:25.699
In that case, DI Fleming...

17:25.734 --> 17:29.393
this department is grateful
for your cooperation.

17:29.427 --> 17:30.497
Sir.

17:33.673 --> 17:36.365
Steve, I want you to put
Terry Boyles

17:36.400 --> 17:38.333
approved accommodation
under surveillance.

17:38.367 --> 17:40.645
It's the least we can do
to protect the lad.

17:41.474 --> 17:42.544
Thank you, sir.

17:44.373 --> 17:45.443
Thank you, sir.

17:57.352 --> 17:59.250
The officer that saved Terry
from drowning,

17:59.285 --> 18:02.184
there's something about him.
I'm sure I've met him before.

18:02.219 --> 18:04.704
-Who's the officer?
-Ryan Pilkington.

18:13.161 --> 18:15.611
-Christ.
-What?

18:29.936 --> 18:31.524
Oh my God.

18:31.558 --> 18:33.767
I interviewed him when
he was a juvenile offender.

18:33.802 --> 18:35.735
Little bastard damn near
cut off my fingers.

18:39.980 --> 18:41.361
After the Gates case
was closed,

18:41.396 --> 18:43.432
a neighbourhood copper took
Ryan under his wing.

18:43.467 --> 18:45.469
Helped get him fostered
and back into education.

18:46.746 --> 18:48.437
There's not so much
as a caution since then.

18:49.645 --> 18:51.268
As a juvenile with
no convictions,

18:51.302 --> 18:52.993
his arrest record would have
fallen off the system.

18:53.028 --> 18:55.306
The vetting officer
could have missed this.

18:55.341 --> 18:56.480
Or someone's removed it.

18:57.895 --> 18:59.655
How'd he end up
on Davidson's team?

18:59.690 --> 19:01.243
Recent recruit.

19:03.003 --> 19:04.384
Davidson brings him
into the fold

19:04.419 --> 19:05.730
and he just happens
to be escorting Terry

19:05.765 --> 19:06.938
the night Terry nearly drowns.

19:10.701 --> 19:11.633
I'm gonna have to get off.

19:13.359 --> 19:16.396
Shame, I was feeling
a takeaway coming on.

19:16.431 --> 19:17.501
Don't tempt me.

19:18.329 --> 19:19.641
-Night, mate.
-Night.

19:54.054 --> 19:56.229
Superintendent Hastings.

19:56.264 --> 19:57.610
<i>It's Steph.</i>

19:57.644 --> 20:00.337
Look, Steph, I told you, you
have to be careful about

20:00.371 --> 20:01.476
calling me at work.

20:01.510 --> 20:03.063
I tried your mobile.

20:03.098 --> 20:04.824
<i>Yes, I know. I was in a meeting.</i>

20:04.858 --> 20:06.274
<i>I must have forgot
to switch it back on.</i>

20:07.654 --> 20:08.724
It's about Steve.

20:09.484 --> 20:10.554
He's got me worried.

20:11.279 --> 20:12.556
Steve Arnott?

20:12.590 --> 20:14.316
Why? What's Steve been up to?

20:14.799 --> 20:16.249
He called in.

20:16.974 --> 20:19.045
What do you mean he called in?

20:19.079 --> 20:21.427
He said he was just
dropping by for a cuppa, like,

20:21.461 --> 20:23.014
you know when he was
on this case up here.

20:24.568 --> 20:26.639
Look, we really shouldn't
be discussing this

20:26.673 --> 20:28.641
on my work phone. I'll, er...

20:28.675 --> 20:30.332
<i>I'll give you a call
on the mobile</i>

20:30.367 --> 20:31.885
<i>when I'm outside
the building. Okay?</i>

20:33.128 --> 20:34.405
Okay.

20:54.977 --> 20:56.047
Cheers, Tom.

21:15.481 --> 21:18.794
Sir. You remember Gail's
producer reported there was

21:18.829 --> 21:21.349
material she'd recorded
that was never broadcast.

21:21.383 --> 21:22.660
He sent it all through.

21:25.629 --> 21:26.595
<i>Chief Constable Osborne,</i>

21:26.630 --> 21:27.872
<i>Central police recently
announced</i>

21:27.907 --> 21:29.978
<i>increased funding
for more frontline officers.</i>

21:30.012 --> 21:31.876
<i>Five hundred more officers
on the beat.</i>

21:31.911 --> 21:35.363
<i>Well, we're committed to making our communities safe.</i>

21:35.397 --> 21:37.675
<i>Well, I've examined the figures for police recruitment,</i>

21:37.710 --> 21:40.747
<i>and 190 of those 500 officers
are already serving,</i>

21:40.782 --> 21:43.440
<i>so it's actually 310 more.</i>

21:43.474 --> 21:45.545
<i>I don't know where you're
getting your figures from--</i>

21:45.580 --> 21:48.997
<i>The figures came from your
own office, Chief Constable.</i>

21:49.031 --> 21:50.723
<i>Furthermore,
over the past ten years</i>

21:50.757 --> 21:52.828
<i>police numbers have been cut
by 600 officers.</i>

21:52.863 --> 21:55.866
<i>The truth is, you're still
a hundred officers short.</i>

21:57.074 --> 21:59.179
<i>Rohan Sindwhani,
you were elected</i>

21:59.214 --> 22:01.665
<i>Police and Crime Commissioner
on a reforming platform,</i>

22:01.699 --> 22:04.081
<i>promising to root out corruption.</i>

22:04.115 --> 22:06.014
<i>Why, then, following the
conviction</i>

22:06.048 --> 22:08.568
<i>of Chief Superintendent
Patrick Fairbank,</i>

22:08.603 --> 22:11.675
<i>haven't you established an
inquiry into the suppression</i>

22:11.709 --> 22:15.057
<i>of police investigations into child sexual exploitation?</i>

22:15.092 --> 22:16.887
<i>Chief Constable
Osborne has assured me</i>

22:16.921 --> 22:20.408
<i>there's insufficient evidence
to support a public inquiry.</i>

22:20.442 --> 22:22.927
<i>It doesn't concern you
that officers</i>

22:22.962 --> 22:25.792
<i>who may have colluded
in child sexual exploitation</i>

22:25.827 --> 22:28.001
<i>have been allowed to retire
without facing justice?</i>

22:28.036 --> 22:30.383
<i>Some may even still be serving.</i>

22:30.418 --> 22:32.903
<i>The Dale Roach scandal
was before my term of office.</i>

22:32.937 --> 22:35.871
<i>It was during your term, Mr Sidwani,</i>

22:35.906 --> 22:39.012
<i>that instead of pursuing
the guilty police officers,</i>

22:39.047 --> 22:42.671
<i>your constabulary investigated celebrities and VIPs</i>

22:42.706 --> 22:44.639
<i>all without charge.</i>

22:44.673 --> 22:46.882
<i>Officers arguably colluded
with the BBC</i>

22:46.917 --> 22:48.194
<i>in enabling a news helicopter</i>

22:48.228 --> 22:51.231
<i>to film the search of an
elderly pop star's home,</i>

22:51.266 --> 22:52.819
<i>again without charge.</i>

22:52.854 --> 22:55.477
<i>I'm afraid
we've got to leave it there.</i>

22:55.512 --> 22:59.550
<i>You don't feel it's your place as the PCC to comment on that?</i>

22:59.585 --> 23:01.172
<i>Do you feel the public
are losing trust</i>

23:01.207 --> 23:02.864
<i>in your constabulary?</i>

23:02.898 --> 23:05.245
If we're looking for a motive
for Gail's murder,

23:05.280 --> 23:07.731
this definitely doesn't
seem like enough.

23:07.765 --> 23:10.181
Chloe's right, sir. If they
could have Gail censored,

23:10.216 --> 23:11.838
why would anyone need
worry about her?

23:11.873 --> 23:15.394
Whatever got Gail Vella
murdered, we haven't found it.

23:18.155 --> 23:19.536
Something going on, sir?

23:19.570 --> 23:22.849
Yeah, just AC-9
routine drugs testing, yeah.

23:25.265 --> 23:26.922
I've got to get over
to check on the surveillance

23:26.957 --> 23:28.441
at Terry Boyle's
approved premises.

23:29.787 --> 23:31.168
Yeah.

23:31.202 --> 23:33.722
Well, you know, you're not
on their list, Steve.

23:33.757 --> 23:35.655
I told them you
aren't available today.

23:37.174 --> 23:38.209
Cheers, gaffer.

23:39.521 --> 23:41.420
-On you go, son.
-Ta.

24:21.701 --> 24:25.256
We understand
PS Jatri is on remand.

24:25.291 --> 24:27.604
And DCI Davidson was arrested,

24:27.638 --> 24:30.227
then subsequently released
without charge.

24:30.261 --> 24:32.574
I've had to call in favours
from half a dozen editors

24:32.609 --> 24:34.576
to keep this out of the press.

24:34.611 --> 24:36.233
You must have been
in a different conversation,

24:36.267 --> 24:39.063
because the one I remember made
clear AC-12 will be conducting

24:39.098 --> 24:42.239
a routine performance review
of Operation Lighthouse.

24:42.273 --> 24:44.517
Yes, well I cannot consider
another course of action

24:44.552 --> 24:47.347
in the face of information
leakage by PS Jatri

24:47.382 --> 24:49.557
and the possible collusion
of other police officers.

24:49.591 --> 24:50.937
The proper course of action

24:50.972 --> 24:52.732
would have been determined
through consultation,

24:52.767 --> 24:56.909
so we'd have time to consider
all the ramifications.

24:56.943 --> 24:59.290
We all share the same
goal here, Ted.

25:00.084 --> 25:01.154
Justice for Gail Vella.

25:01.189 --> 25:02.535
Lovely person.

25:04.019 --> 25:05.296
Terrible loss.

25:08.403 --> 25:10.129
My actions and the actions
of my officers

25:10.163 --> 25:12.683
are determined by one thing
and one thing only.

25:12.718 --> 25:15.962
And that is the letter
of the law. The letter.

25:15.997 --> 25:17.308
I don't think
that's the only thing

25:17.343 --> 25:18.724
your actions are determined by.

25:19.759 --> 25:21.209
Operation Pear Tree concluded

25:21.243 --> 25:24.557
there is no institutional
corruption in this force.

25:25.972 --> 25:29.907
AC-12's inquiry remains
open regarding the existence

25:29.942 --> 25:33.152
of a putative figure,
once codenamed "H",

25:33.877 --> 25:35.706
now the fourth man

25:35.741 --> 25:39.572
still at large orchestrating
a clandestine network

25:39.607 --> 25:42.230
of organised criminals
and corrupt police officers.

25:42.264 --> 25:46.096
We want to work with you,
Superintendent, not against you.

25:47.960 --> 25:49.858
You're making this quite
difficult for me.

25:57.901 --> 26:00.938
You were issued a final
written warning, Ted.

26:02.319 --> 26:06.841
Don't waste your last roll
of the dice chasing a phantom.

26:06.875 --> 26:08.808
Your inquiry into "H"
should close.

26:10.741 --> 26:12.640
This isn't about old battles.

26:14.331 --> 26:15.988
The name's Hastings, ma'am.

26:17.196 --> 26:20.717
I'm the epitome
of an old battle, ma'am.

27:00.722 --> 27:01.896
You alright, Steph?

27:02.344 --> 27:03.760
Steve!

27:03.794 --> 27:05.106
Do you mind if I come
in for a minute?

27:06.797 --> 27:08.040
Yeah, sure. Come in.

27:13.424 --> 27:16.048
-Can I get you a cuppa or...?
-I'm fine.

27:18.326 --> 27:21.122
Sorry, I wasn't expecting you
here that quick.

27:21.156 --> 27:23.262
The thing is, I just dropped
the girls at school

27:23.296 --> 27:24.953
and then I'm straight back out.

27:24.988 --> 27:26.265
Something wrong, Steph?

27:28.129 --> 27:30.303
Sorry. No, just a bit flustered.

27:32.305 --> 27:33.790
My gaffer's ordered drugs tests.

27:36.827 --> 27:38.380
Oh, my god. I never thought...

27:38.415 --> 27:40.072
Didn't realise you two
were in touch.

27:41.211 --> 27:43.351
No, we're not. Not really.

27:43.385 --> 27:44.697
I just had his number from when

27:44.732 --> 27:46.078
he sent his condolences
about John.

27:46.112 --> 27:48.390
So you told him
I'd been up here?

27:48.425 --> 27:51.946
Just that you was passing
on a job, like. I never meant--

27:51.980 --> 27:53.326
He knows.

27:54.983 --> 27:56.536
Fortunately, he made sure
they missed me out,

27:56.571 --> 28:01.024
but it's a warning, a nudge
for me to sort myself out.

28:06.236 --> 28:08.341
Then he's done the right thing
by you, hasn't he?

28:12.414 --> 28:17.109
John, he did some jobs
in the early days,

28:17.143 --> 28:18.835
and had to mess with drugs.

28:21.492 --> 28:24.047
They can take over
your life, Steve.

28:26.359 --> 28:28.292
You spend every
minute of the day

28:28.327 --> 28:30.294
lying to every poor sap
that cares about you.

28:36.853 --> 28:38.268
I shouldn't have
barged in like this.

28:40.235 --> 28:41.236
You meant well.

28:43.860 --> 28:44.861
I should go.

28:47.518 --> 28:48.899
I would've talked to you first,

28:48.934 --> 28:50.349
only I never thought
you'd be back.

28:52.247 --> 28:53.283
I said I'd be back.

28:54.111 --> 28:55.112
I know.

28:57.045 --> 28:58.253
But you was just being nice.

29:00.600 --> 29:02.257
John's been gone 18 months.

29:03.914 --> 29:04.915
Life goes on.

29:07.262 --> 29:08.298
For everyone else, anyway.

29:10.990 --> 29:11.991
I'm sorry, Steph.

29:13.234 --> 29:14.235
I didn't mean to upset you.

29:38.328 --> 29:39.329
Chloe.

29:43.920 --> 29:46.060
I need you to look into these
financial records, please.

29:48.303 --> 29:50.133
The UCO that got killed?

29:50.167 --> 29:51.272
What? Do you reckon
he was on the take?

29:51.306 --> 29:53.308
I'll fire over the case number
and access authority

29:53.343 --> 29:55.069
when I'm in my computer.

29:55.103 --> 29:56.553
I'll get right on it, boss.

30:18.678 --> 30:19.887
It shouldn't take long.

30:19.921 --> 30:21.474
Just a few questions as you were

30:21.509 --> 30:23.304
the only surviving
police witness.

30:23.338 --> 30:24.201
Very happy to help, ma'am.

30:25.927 --> 30:27.964
Now you and Lisa Patel
were travelling

30:27.998 --> 30:31.070
with Terry Boyle
along Reservoir Road.

30:31.105 --> 30:33.348
You know that
wasn't the route assigned?

30:33.383 --> 30:34.591
So I've been told since, ma'am.

30:35.972 --> 30:37.905
Any idea why that route
was taken that night?

30:38.457 --> 30:39.872
Lisa did the driving.

30:39.907 --> 30:41.460
Sorry, ma'am,
I didn't question it.

30:44.049 --> 30:46.396
We're still looking into what
caused the patrol car

30:46.430 --> 30:47.431
to veer off the road.

30:48.225 --> 30:49.330
In your statement

30:49.364 --> 30:52.989
you mentioned the possibility
of a tyre blow-out.

30:53.023 --> 30:54.680
After they pulled the patrol car
out of the water,

30:54.714 --> 30:56.578
I saw that all
the tyres were intact,

30:56.613 --> 30:57.994
so I must've been
mistaken, ma'am.

30:59.996 --> 31:02.205
The other possibility
you mentioned was a gunshot.

31:03.551 --> 31:05.277
There was no bullet damage
to the patrol car,

31:05.311 --> 31:07.555
so maybe I was mistaken.

31:07.589 --> 31:10.247
Unless Lisa saw a muzzle flash
and took evasive action.

31:13.699 --> 31:15.666
A search of the vicinity found

31:15.701 --> 31:17.116
no evidence of a gunman,

31:18.255 --> 31:20.292
no ejected cartridge...

31:20.326 --> 31:22.294
Sorry, ma'am,
I've racked my brains.

31:24.020 --> 31:26.539
Well, something made
that car go into the water.

31:34.513 --> 31:37.481
Now another significant finding
with the patrol car

31:37.516 --> 31:41.244
was the offside
rear window was wide open.

31:41.278 --> 31:44.247
Now this would have permitted
your escape underwater.

31:44.281 --> 31:46.628
As you know for suspect transit,

31:46.663 --> 31:48.941
the rear window
controls are disabled.

31:48.976 --> 31:50.322
Lisa opened it
from the front seat.

31:51.219 --> 31:52.220
I needed some fresh air.

31:54.084 --> 31:55.085
Wow.

31:56.362 --> 31:58.123
That was some good luck
for you, wasn't it?

31:58.157 --> 31:59.400
Yes, ma'am.

31:59.434 --> 32:00.435
I thank my lucky stars.

32:03.162 --> 32:06.096
A post-mortem's been carried out
on PC Lisa Patel,

32:06.131 --> 32:08.512
they detected broken fingernails

32:08.547 --> 32:10.963
and bruising
on the back of her neck.

32:10.998 --> 32:12.620
Are you able to account
for those findings?

32:13.448 --> 32:15.002
As soon as we hit the water,

32:15.036 --> 32:16.796
I swam out trying to save Terry.

32:16.831 --> 32:18.626
I didn't witness what
happened to Lisa, ma'am.

32:20.352 --> 32:22.112
Cause of death was drowning.

32:22.147 --> 32:25.150
But Lisa was a strong swimmer,
the water wasn't deep.

32:25.184 --> 32:27.428
Those injuries suggest that
she was hurt in the crash

32:27.462 --> 32:29.223
or in trying to escape
the patrol car, ma'am.

32:40.579 --> 32:42.029
-All done.
-Ma'am.

33:06.708 --> 33:07.709
DI Arnott.

33:17.478 --> 33:20.205
Thank you so much.
Appreciate it. Thank you.

33:20.239 --> 33:21.861
We finally got
a breakthrough, sir.

33:21.896 --> 33:23.380
According to council records,

33:23.415 --> 33:25.762
the freezer is the exact
same make and model

33:25.796 --> 33:27.695
that was installed
at Terry Boyle's flat.

33:27.729 --> 33:30.042
The appliance appeared
overnight on the 27th,

33:30.077 --> 33:31.423
which fits with the exact window

33:31.457 --> 33:34.357
for Terry Boyle to be
substituted for Carl Banks.

33:34.391 --> 33:35.806
They only had a few
hours which explains

33:35.841 --> 33:37.222
why it's been
dumped it in a rush.

33:37.256 --> 33:38.878
Security cameras
pick anything up?

33:38.913 --> 33:40.328
That footage is missing.

33:40.363 --> 33:41.605
And none of the staff
are saying a word.

33:41.640 --> 33:44.332
I can't even get any of them
to own up to working that night.

33:47.370 --> 33:50.304
This freezer you've found,
what about Davidson's mob,

33:50.338 --> 33:52.306
what, they just
decided not to search?

33:52.340 --> 33:53.686
Well, according to the files,

33:53.721 --> 33:55.861
they didn't consider it
important evidence.

33:55.895 --> 33:57.897
DCI Davidson assumed Terry Boyle

33:57.932 --> 33:59.796
had sold the appliance
to buy drugs.

33:59.830 --> 34:02.247
In our view he's more likely
to be a victim of cuckooing,

34:02.281 --> 34:03.800
whereby his home's
invaded by criminals

34:03.834 --> 34:05.664
to carry out illicit activities.

34:05.698 --> 34:07.838
Intimidation of witnesses
in that scrapyard,

34:07.873 --> 34:10.496
that's a clear indication
of organised crime.

34:10.531 --> 34:12.153
And from day one DCI Davidson

34:12.188 --> 34:14.569
has done her best
to steer her inquiry away

34:14.604 --> 34:17.227
from any OCG involvement
in Gail Vella's murder.

34:17.262 --> 34:19.367
Well, so far, sir,
that's the missing link.

34:19.402 --> 34:21.128
Now we know
about Ryan Pilkington,

34:21.162 --> 34:24.234
is there a connection
between Jo Davidson and an OCG?

34:24.269 --> 34:25.615
PS Farida Jatri's in Brentiss

34:25.649 --> 34:27.099
for having leaked information.

34:27.134 --> 34:28.756
If anyone knows
about Davidson, it's her.

34:29.308 --> 34:31.621
Right, okay.

34:31.655 --> 34:34.106
Do some digging,
see what you can come up with.

34:34.141 --> 34:36.177
Thank you, good work, you two.

34:36.212 --> 34:37.385
Gaffer.
Sir.

34:40.354 --> 34:41.803
Stand away from the door!

34:42.977 --> 34:45.911
You're required
to attend an AC-12 interview.

34:45.945 --> 34:47.671
Please stand upright facing away

34:47.706 --> 34:49.259
and place your hands
behind your back.

34:49.294 --> 34:50.536
Do I really need
to be handcuffed?

34:51.227 --> 34:52.331
Are you resisting?

35:07.898 --> 35:09.037
What's up?

35:09.072 --> 35:11.350
PS Jatri's in the prison
hospital with a broken wrist.

35:11.385 --> 35:13.490
And she's refusing to give
a post-charge interview.

35:15.458 --> 35:16.528
Let's go.

35:22.603 --> 35:23.604
Wait here.

35:35.340 --> 35:36.996
How can I help you, DI Arnott?

35:37.031 --> 35:38.757
Ma'am, I'd like to ask you
about the suggestion

35:38.791 --> 35:40.207
Gail Vella's murder
was accompanied

35:40.241 --> 35:42.450
by a burglary at her home.

35:42.485 --> 35:44.521
No record appears in the files.

35:44.556 --> 35:47.662
My team is cooperating fully
so feel free to ask around.

35:47.697 --> 35:49.354
The delayed access to your files

35:49.388 --> 35:51.735
that you orchestrated
with the DCC

35:51.770 --> 35:53.910
that would've given you time
to remove any files.

35:53.944 --> 35:55.912
Why would I remove files?

35:55.946 --> 35:58.570
DCI Davidson,
did you remove files?

36:00.019 --> 36:03.437
If you have any evidence
to back up that allegation,

36:03.471 --> 36:05.991
put your questions in writing
to my Police Federation Rep

36:06.025 --> 36:09.339
and we'll get back to you
within ten working days.

36:09.374 --> 36:12.929
Now if you'll excuse me,
I've got a case review.

36:14.068 --> 36:15.725
AC-12's inquiry's
detected evidence

36:15.759 --> 36:16.967
we'd like to put to Terry Boyle.

36:18.693 --> 36:19.832
Disclose it to me

36:19.867 --> 36:22.249
and I'll be happy to include
it in his next interview.

36:22.283 --> 36:23.733
It's confidential.

36:23.767 --> 36:26.598
We'd prefer to interview
Terry Boyle ourselves.

36:26.632 --> 36:29.739
You'll need a Production Order
in writing. Got one?

36:32.742 --> 36:33.743
Sorry.

36:38.334 --> 36:39.887
As you know, ma'am,
PS Farida Jatri

36:39.921 --> 36:41.992
made a number
of allegations against you.

36:42.027 --> 36:43.166
I wonder if you can explain why

36:43.201 --> 36:44.823
she might have stopped
cooperating with our inquiry.

36:45.582 --> 36:46.790
Sorry.

36:46.825 --> 36:49.379
No idea how she came to be
assaulted in Brentiss Prison?

36:50.760 --> 36:52.451
Uh. No.

36:55.868 --> 36:58.492
How is she? Is she badly hurt?

36:58.526 --> 37:01.288
Ma'am, only OCG have the power
to reach inside prisons

37:01.322 --> 37:02.185
and silence witnesses.

37:03.359 --> 37:04.636
Or did the order come
from someone else

37:04.670 --> 37:06.569
who'd benefit
from Farida not testifying?

37:08.571 --> 37:09.986
You should investigate.

37:11.401 --> 37:12.782
Believe me. I will.

37:18.339 --> 37:19.547
Get a statement
from every officer

37:19.582 --> 37:20.583
on those missing files.

37:21.308 --> 37:22.309
Sir.

37:38.117 --> 37:40.327
No one admitted anything
about missing files.

37:40.361 --> 37:41.431
No, I didn't think they would.

37:41.466 --> 37:42.915
But they know we're on to them.

37:42.950 --> 37:45.124
The burner phones
recovered from Farida's house,

37:45.159 --> 37:46.609
any joy yet tracing contacts?

37:46.643 --> 37:48.058
Uh, only one contact,

37:48.093 --> 37:49.301
the burner
she called on the night

37:49.336 --> 37:50.337
of the attempted arrest.

37:50.371 --> 37:52.097
That number went
out of service a few hours later

37:52.131 --> 37:54.513
and didn't call
any other phones.

37:54.548 --> 37:55.583
I'm thinking we should
get a warrant

37:55.618 --> 37:57.585
to expand the forensic
search of Farida's house.

37:58.759 --> 38:01.555
But the place was full
of her prints and DNA.

38:01.589 --> 38:04.351
I mean expand the search to find
someone else's prints or DNA.

38:04.385 --> 38:06.525
In case Farida had contact
with a criminal conspirator.

38:08.838 --> 38:10.633
And it would just be
a wild coincidence

38:10.667 --> 38:13.014
if Jo Davidson's DNA shows up.

38:13.049 --> 38:14.361
Thought never crossed my mind.

39:43.208 --> 39:44.209
Chris, you got a minute?

39:44.934 --> 39:45.935
Sure.

39:51.181 --> 39:52.217
We've been going
round the houses

39:52.251 --> 39:55.151
trying to ID who confessed
to Alastair Oldroyd.

39:55.185 --> 39:56.808
Till we got a witness
ID'ing Terry Boyle.

39:58.085 --> 39:59.742
You've been back
to the pub, right?

39:59.776 --> 40:01.813
-Any corroborating witnesses?
-No.

40:03.228 --> 40:04.781
-CCTV?
-No.

40:06.196 --> 40:07.819
You ran a background check
on the witness?

40:08.716 --> 40:10.131
No.

40:10.166 --> 40:12.479
-Run one.
-Ma'am.

40:39.022 --> 40:41.922
Sir, the financial records
that you requested.

40:41.956 --> 40:42.957
Ta.

41:01.631 --> 41:02.736
Steve.

41:02.770 --> 41:03.840
Sorry it's so late.

41:05.186 --> 41:06.567
And sorry about the other day.

41:08.258 --> 41:09.259
You're all right.

41:11.227 --> 41:13.609
Come on in. There's a bottle
of wine open if you fancy?

41:13.643 --> 41:14.851
Cheers. I'm driving.

41:17.026 --> 41:18.303
John always kept
a bottle of Scotch

41:18.337 --> 41:19.822
if that's more your thing.

41:19.856 --> 41:20.857
Better not.

41:22.100 --> 41:23.550
Talking of John...

41:23.584 --> 41:25.966
You know that life insurance
you mentioned. It's...

41:26.000 --> 41:27.830
It's worrying how fast
that can get used up.

41:29.003 --> 41:30.108
Did you have financial advice?

41:31.903 --> 41:33.283
If you ain't
having a glass, I will.

41:40.774 --> 41:42.223
Mate of mine
runs a hairdresser's.

41:43.397 --> 41:45.157
I bought into a share
of the business

41:45.192 --> 41:47.228
and I work there part time.

41:48.678 --> 41:51.957
So I get a percentage
of the profits and a wage

41:51.992 --> 41:53.580
to keep me
and the girls ticking over.

41:53.614 --> 41:54.615
Smart move.

41:55.685 --> 41:56.893
Sounds like a good mate.

41:56.928 --> 41:59.240
You've come all this way.
Are you sure I can't tempt you?

42:01.622 --> 42:02.623
Maybe a small one.

42:11.390 --> 42:13.634
If I have all that, I'm not
going to be fit to drive.

42:13.669 --> 42:15.705
Sorry. When the girls
have gone to bed...

42:16.982 --> 42:19.709
It's just nice having
some grown-up company.

42:28.856 --> 42:30.202
You remind me of him.

42:30.237 --> 42:31.756
-Both short arses?

42:34.931 --> 42:35.932
Good men.

42:38.107 --> 42:39.108
Caring men.

42:43.664 --> 42:45.010
I should probably go.

42:46.115 --> 42:47.392
You've got a girlfriend?

42:49.843 --> 42:50.844
No.

42:54.019 --> 42:55.020
No one at all?

42:59.197 --> 43:00.405
No one at all.

43:05.272 --> 43:06.273
You can bring
the drink with you.

43:39.996 --> 43:42.205
Ah, thanks, Jo.

43:42.240 --> 43:43.724
Nice to get out of the station.

43:45.761 --> 43:48.073
Easier to talk here.
About Terry.

43:49.212 --> 43:51.801
Yeah. Well, he's being
well looked after,

43:51.836 --> 43:52.837
that's not the issue.

43:54.045 --> 43:57.704
He's... Well, he's frightened.

43:57.738 --> 44:01.017
AC-12 have put in a request
to interview him.

44:01.052 --> 44:02.363
Why do they want
to interview Terry?

44:04.365 --> 44:07.058
They keep banging on
about organised crime.

44:07.092 --> 44:09.439
They must get a pound
every time someone says "OCG".

44:11.303 --> 44:14.099
But we believe that's who
the leak went to, don't we?

44:14.134 --> 44:15.445
The leak from Farida, I mean.

44:17.068 --> 44:20.416
All we actually know is Farida
was responsible for a leak.

44:22.729 --> 44:24.213
Look, boss...

44:24.247 --> 44:25.939
I don't want to speak
out of turn, but...

44:26.733 --> 44:27.734
Fire away.

44:29.252 --> 44:31.323
Well, she claims that
you two were close.

44:34.188 --> 44:37.916
I imagine everyone's got off
on that little scenario.

44:37.951 --> 44:40.850
No life of their own so they
pick holes in someone else's,

44:40.885 --> 44:42.403
especially if you're
a single woman.

44:43.128 --> 44:44.820
Yeah. Tell me about it.

44:44.854 --> 44:46.200
All it takes is a short haircut.

44:48.858 --> 44:50.411
Whatever you've
heard, Kate, it's wrong.

44:52.275 --> 44:53.345
Farida is a liar.

44:54.968 --> 44:55.969
That's not me.

44:57.591 --> 44:58.730
Okay.

45:01.388 --> 45:02.527
I'm just gonna pop to the loo.

45:14.470 --> 45:15.471
This is nice.

45:16.437 --> 45:17.438
Yeah.

45:19.786 --> 45:20.787
I'm leading you on.

45:21.788 --> 45:22.789
No.

45:23.859 --> 45:25.136
There's a worse phrase for it.

45:27.000 --> 45:28.001
It's just...

45:29.968 --> 45:31.038
I miss him too much.

45:32.281 --> 45:34.421
If it's... Sorry.

45:35.594 --> 45:36.734
It's fine, Steph.

45:37.527 --> 45:38.528
I get it.

45:39.529 --> 45:40.530
No sex is fine.

45:46.329 --> 45:49.816
Three... Three
and a half years ago,

45:49.850 --> 45:51.231
I got badly injured at work.

45:53.026 --> 45:54.234
I was in a wheelchair,

45:54.855 --> 45:55.856
then crutches,

45:56.512 --> 45:57.513
a year of physio.

46:00.240 --> 46:02.000
I look like I made
a full recovery.

46:04.347 --> 46:05.348
But you haven't?

46:07.247 --> 46:08.455
That's why you
need the painkillers?

46:12.459 --> 46:13.460
It's my back.

46:15.600 --> 46:17.015
There's still some nerve damage.

46:22.227 --> 46:23.297
It affects me in...

46:25.541 --> 46:26.542
in bed.

46:32.203 --> 46:33.342
You gotta see a doctor.

46:38.140 --> 46:39.831
Then they'd know
my back's still not right.

46:42.972 --> 46:45.112
My job's pretty much
the only thing I've got left.

47:00.162 --> 47:01.163
Morning.

47:04.166 --> 47:06.478
Oh, shit,
I've got to get to work.

47:06.513 --> 47:09.033
I'm just getting
the girls out the door.

47:09.067 --> 47:10.586
You okay to give it a minute?

47:10.620 --> 47:12.001
Yeah. Course.

47:14.521 --> 47:15.522
Have a good day.

47:16.005 --> 47:17.006
You too.

48:45.163 --> 48:47.096
Hey, guys, can I just grab
your attention for a sec?

48:48.753 --> 48:50.272
I'm sure you've
all heard the sad news

48:50.306 --> 48:52.274
that tragically PC Lisa Patel

48:52.308 --> 48:54.586
lost her life
in the line of duty.

48:54.621 --> 48:56.036
Our thoughts
are with Lisa's family.

48:57.382 --> 48:58.590
Things could've
been far, far worse

48:58.625 --> 49:00.006
if it hadn't been for an officer

49:00.040 --> 49:02.215
still only serving
his probation.

49:02.249 --> 49:04.976
I'm going to be putting forward
that officer for a commendation.

49:05.011 --> 49:08.290
PC Ryan Pilkington.
Let's get a photo, mate. Ryan.

49:12.087 --> 49:13.398
Nice one. Yeah.

49:13.433 --> 49:15.021
-Congratulations.
-Thanks.

49:15.055 --> 49:16.298
Thanks, everyone. Back to work.

49:19.715 --> 49:21.613
Well, that was toe-curling.

49:21.648 --> 49:23.270
Could have waited
until we'd paid our respects

49:23.305 --> 49:25.031
to Lisa before grabbing
a bloody photo op.

49:25.479 --> 49:26.480
What a twat.

49:28.758 --> 49:30.450
I hope he's going to give
credit where it's due.

49:31.313 --> 49:32.383
How do you mean?

49:32.417 --> 49:34.385
You brought Ryan
onto the team, boss.

49:35.386 --> 49:37.698
Not me. That was Buckells' idea.

49:37.733 --> 49:40.218
Family friend or something.

49:40.253 --> 49:42.565
Probably got a nudge down
at the Masonic Lodge.

49:44.740 --> 49:46.190
Yeah. 4 o'clock's fine.

49:46.224 --> 49:47.777
Yeah, tee off's, yeah.

49:47.812 --> 49:49.779
Okay, I'll do an early swerve.

49:49.814 --> 49:51.298
All right, mate.
I'll see you later.

50:08.212 --> 50:11.353
<i>Boss.
-Chris, sorry to bother you.</i>

50:11.387 --> 50:14.149
I just happened to be driving
past Farida Jatri's place

50:14.183 --> 50:16.530
and there's a new
forensic search going on.

50:16.565 --> 50:18.394
<i>News to me, boss,
let me check.</i>

50:27.576 --> 50:28.887
<i>Nothing to do with us, ma'am.</i>

50:28.922 --> 50:30.889
<i>Gotta be AC-12.</i>

50:30.924 --> 50:32.270
<i>Is there anything you
want me to do or...?</i>

50:32.305 --> 50:33.513
No. No.

50:34.721 --> 50:36.136
Thanks, Chris.

50:36.171 --> 50:37.172
<i>Ma'am.</i>

51:17.626 --> 51:19.352
Couple of things
from forensics, sir.

51:19.386 --> 51:21.802
Still nothing from the harvest
at Farida Jatri's address.

51:21.837 --> 51:23.149
Okay.

51:23.183 --> 51:25.151
But we've got the full forensic
report on Terry Boyle's freezer.

51:32.813 --> 51:35.161
The most significant
finding is a blood deposit

51:35.195 --> 51:37.266
detected in the freezer
compartment.

51:37.301 --> 51:39.303
DNA analysis
of the blood deposit

51:39.337 --> 51:41.408
gives a 99.9 percent probability

51:41.443 --> 51:44.791
of a match to a person
previously known to AC-12.

51:45.792 --> 51:47.966
Jackie Laverty.

51:48.001 --> 51:52.281
What, Jackie Laverty,
Tony Gates's bit on the side?

51:52.316 --> 51:53.420
Correct, sir.

51:53.455 --> 51:55.250
As you'll recall, Tony Gates
claimed she was murdered

51:55.284 --> 51:57.286
by OCG in 2012,

51:57.321 --> 51:59.909
but her dismembered remains
weren't discovered until 2019,

51:59.944 --> 52:01.739
alongside the remains
of DS John Corbett.

52:02.567 --> 52:03.879
Yeah.

52:04.983 --> 52:06.847
So what you reckon the OCG

52:06.882 --> 52:08.539
kept Jackie Laverty's body parts

52:08.573 --> 52:11.749
hidden in Terry Boyle's freezer
for what, seven years?

52:11.783 --> 52:14.717
It fits with Terry being
the victim of cuckooing, sir.

52:14.752 --> 52:16.340
Not only did they
store drugs in his flat

52:16.374 --> 52:17.962
they hid a murder victim.

52:17.996 --> 52:19.653
Well if this is true,
I mean this is it.

52:20.861 --> 52:22.967
-This is the whole damn thing!
Yes, sir.

52:23.001 --> 52:25.176
The organised criminals involved
in Jackie Laverty's murder

52:25.211 --> 52:27.937
were somehow involved
in the murder of Gail Vella.

52:27.972 --> 52:29.387
And this little fella,
Terry Boyle,

52:29.422 --> 52:32.010
I mean, he must
have a tale to tell, or three.

52:32.045 --> 52:34.012
Hence the reason Davidson
shut down his interview

52:34.047 --> 52:36.567
and possibly colluded
in the attempt on Terry's life.

52:36.601 --> 52:38.707
All to stop him testifying.

52:38.741 --> 52:40.502
We really need
to interview him, sir.

52:40.536 --> 52:43.298
Aye, and woe betide
anybody gets in our way.

52:43.746 --> 52:44.747
-Sir.
-Sir.

52:51.961 --> 52:53.446
Superintendent Hastings.

52:53.480 --> 52:54.757
Yeah. Put me
through to the Hill.

52:57.070 --> 52:59.003
Detective Superintendent
Ian Buckells.

53:00.660 --> 53:02.765
-They're back?
-Classic tactic.

53:02.800 --> 53:04.560
Do the tests in two stages.

53:04.595 --> 53:06.183
Gives the druggies
enough time to get clean.

53:09.082 --> 53:10.946
DI Arnott?

53:10.980 --> 53:14.191
Sir, you've been listed
for routine drugs testing.

53:15.088 --> 53:16.296
Please follow me.

53:17.090 --> 53:18.229
Yeah. Hastings.

53:25.029 --> 53:26.513
Detective Superintendent Buckells.

53:31.415 --> 53:32.416
Yeah, put him through.

53:35.488 --> 53:36.489
-Kate?
-Boss.

53:40.320 --> 53:41.563
Permission to speak
freely, ma'am?

53:42.840 --> 53:44.531
Go ahead.

53:44.566 --> 53:47.085
Well I was concerned
by Deborah Devereux's ID

53:47.120 --> 53:48.604
of Terry so I asked Chris Lomax

53:48.639 --> 53:49.985
to look into her history.

53:50.019 --> 53:51.573
In 2012 she was charged

53:51.607 --> 53:53.954
with Assault ABH
against a neighbour.

53:53.989 --> 53:56.681
Proceedings were dropped
due to lack of evidence.

53:56.716 --> 53:59.097
Seems like it was a DI
from Kingsgate Station

53:59.132 --> 54:01.755
that was instrumental
in proceedings being dropped.

54:01.790 --> 54:02.929
She'd owe him a favour.

54:04.551 --> 54:06.001
That DI was Ian Buckells.

54:07.968 --> 54:09.729
Nobody's been hiding anything.

54:10.730 --> 54:12.697
I'll speak
to the DCC if I have to.

54:17.875 --> 54:18.876
Great work, Kate.

54:21.119 --> 54:22.500
I knew you'd
come through for me.

54:23.639 --> 54:25.469
What do you mean, boss?

54:25.503 --> 54:29.058
I needed someone on my team
I could trust completely.

54:29.093 --> 54:31.026
Someone with no chance
of being bent.

54:32.372 --> 54:34.478
Who better than
an ex-anticorruption officer?

54:36.894 --> 54:39.379
The cockup over
the Surveillance Authority,

54:39.931 --> 54:41.347
that was Buckells.

54:41.381 --> 54:43.314
Otherwise we'd
have arrested Banks.

54:43.349 --> 54:44.833
Instead he's dead.

54:44.867 --> 54:48.388
And the CHIS. Oldroyd. Dead too.

54:48.423 --> 54:51.391
Guess who pulled strings
to disclose his identity.

54:51.426 --> 54:55.292
No. Look, can...
Look, can I speak?

54:56.845 --> 54:57.846
That was Buckells?

54:59.848 --> 55:01.712
Shit. What now, Jo?

55:03.369 --> 55:04.818
You're ex-AC-12.

55:05.923 --> 55:06.924
You tell me.

55:15.035 --> 55:17.762
This is bollocks.
Total bastard bollocks.

55:17.797 --> 55:19.695
-Steve.
-Sir. Kate.

55:21.076 --> 55:22.353
This way please, sir.

55:26.840 --> 55:28.808
Sir, we're sending
over the paperwork.

55:28.842 --> 55:30.085
DSU Buckells was arrested

55:30.119 --> 55:32.639
on suspicion of Perverting
the Course of Justice.

55:32.674 --> 55:33.951
We even found
the missing Vella files

55:33.985 --> 55:35.539
in the boot
of his service vehicle.

55:35.573 --> 55:36.988
Great work, Kate, great work.

55:37.023 --> 55:39.163
And do you have anything
to add, DCI Davidson?

55:39.197 --> 55:42.753
No, sir. This is AC-12's
area of expertise.

55:42.787 --> 55:44.548
I'm just glad the guilty
party's been found.

55:45.100 --> 55:46.722
Sir. Kate.

55:49.104 --> 55:50.416
Take a seat please, sir.

55:56.214 --> 55:57.457
What can I say, Kate?

55:58.458 --> 55:59.563
Glad I could help, sir.
