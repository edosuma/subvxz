WEBVTT

00:00.868 --> 00:02.368
- KAREN: Previously on "Sistas".

00:02.470 --> 00:04.937
- Karen wants to meet with me.
- Nope, we are not doing that.

00:05.039 --> 00:06.672
You see where we are?
Brand new.

00:06.774 --> 00:08.540
I'm not doing that no more.
- FATIMA: I know, I know

00:08.642 --> 00:10.142
- You buying me
that penthouse apartment

00:10.244 --> 00:11.844
is not gonna fix this.

00:11.946 --> 00:13.012
- What about loving you?

00:13.114 --> 00:14.279
- That isn't gonna work either.

00:14.382 --> 00:16.448
- So you're saying,
if I help you with Andi,

00:16.550 --> 00:18.817
then you'll help me
with my stocks, I see.

00:18.919 --> 00:20.252
- My man.
- That's -- up.

00:20.354 --> 00:22.087
What, I look like a -- pimp
to help you with Andi?

00:22.189 --> 00:26.225
- We did a joyride
in the Rolls.

00:26.327 --> 00:29.495
- Yeah, and that controllin' ass
man tracked us.

00:29.597 --> 00:33.966
- Okay, we were being followed,
but it was by

00:34.068 --> 00:35.868
these people dressed as cops.

00:35.970 --> 00:37.236
- That sounds kind of illegal.

00:37.338 --> 00:38.937
- Pour Karen some too.
- Yeah, Karen.

00:39.040 --> 00:40.939
- Can't drink.
- Why not?

00:41.042 --> 00:42.574
- Because I'm pregnant.

00:53.788 --> 00:57.656
- You think the -- could have
got a nicer wine opener.

00:59.627 --> 01:02.294
I'm just saying 'cause I can't
get to it fast enough.

01:02.396 --> 01:06.331
- I said I'm pregnant, Danni.
- I know. Damn.

01:08.869 --> 01:11.570
- Are you okay?

01:11.672 --> 01:14.073
- Right, right.
Are you okay?

01:15.443 --> 01:16.775
- Tell us.

01:18.179 --> 01:20.579
- Yes, I am.

01:21.048 --> 01:22.915
- Are you sure?

01:23.317 --> 01:24.917
- Yes.

01:26.087 --> 01:29.521
- Okay, next question.

01:30.925 --> 01:33.392
Are you gonna keep it?

01:33.928 --> 01:38.063
No.
That's a legitimate question.

01:38.165 --> 01:41.467
- For another time.
- Right.

01:41.569 --> 01:44.369
- Of course, I'ma keep
the baby, Danni.

01:44.472 --> 01:46.605
- Okay.

01:48.676 --> 01:51.743
- That's, that's good--
for you.

01:51.846 --> 01:55.881
- It's good for all of us.
- Right. Right.

01:55.983 --> 01:57.749
- It's good for y'all.

01:57.852 --> 02:00.385
I ain't doin' no
damn babysitting.

02:02.256 --> 02:03.822
I'm just sayin'.

02:03.924 --> 02:06.158
- How many times do I have to
tell you, you don't have to say

02:06.260 --> 02:08.427
everything you're thinking?

02:08.529 --> 02:10.596
- Hmm, how many times
do I have to say the shit

02:10.698 --> 02:12.131
y'all are thinkin'
but won't say?

02:12.233 --> 02:13.165
- Okay.

02:20.841 --> 02:24.276
- Well, you know what?
While I'm at it,

02:24.378 --> 02:26.678
next question.

02:28.949 --> 02:31.450
Who's the daddy?

02:36.023 --> 02:37.356
Ladies and gentlemen,

02:37.458 --> 02:40.058
Daniella King has done
it again.

02:40.161 --> 02:43.061
She has silenced them bitches.

02:43.164 --> 02:46.765
The crowd goes silent.

02:50.504 --> 02:52.271
- That is a good question.

02:52.373 --> 02:55.007
- Really, Brina?

02:55.109 --> 02:56.341
- Well.

02:56.443 --> 03:00.612
- It's Zac's baby.
Obviously.

03:04.318 --> 03:05.817
- Okay.
- Does he know?

03:05.920 --> 03:09.054
- Yes. Yes.

03:09.490 --> 03:12.157
- Does Aaron know?

03:12.259 --> 03:14.660
- I told him too.

03:15.529 --> 03:18.864
- Okay.
Okay.

03:21.535 --> 03:24.570
- Well, this sure is somethin'.

03:25.239 --> 03:28.073
- How many weeks are you?

03:28.175 --> 03:29.308
- I don't know.

03:29.410 --> 03:31.510
- Wait, what?

03:31.612 --> 03:32.844
- I ain't been
to the doctor yet.

03:32.947 --> 03:34.313
I don't know.

03:34.415 --> 03:35.781
- Wait girl,
we got all this drama

03:35.883 --> 03:38.150
over a funky pregnancy test?

03:39.687 --> 03:42.454
Those things are
crazy inaccurate.

03:42.556 --> 03:46.258
- Sometimes.
- A lot of times.

03:46.360 --> 03:48.760
- Three of them?
- Oh.

03:50.864 --> 03:52.664
- Yeah.

03:57.371 --> 03:58.971
- That definitely
reduces the odds.

03:59.073 --> 04:00.772
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

04:00.874 --> 04:02.808
- There went my last
shred of hope.

04:02.910 --> 04:05.377
Right there.
- Danni...

04:05.479 --> 04:08.180
A baby is not a bad thing.

04:09.717 --> 04:12.951
- For some.
- Okay, Danni, stop it!

04:13.053 --> 04:17.222
Please.
- Are you sure it's Zac's?

04:17.324 --> 04:19.057
- Yes.

04:20.928 --> 04:23.328
- Okay. They're about
to have some problems.

04:23.430 --> 04:25.264
- Who?
Zac and Fatima?

04:25.366 --> 04:27.666
- Mm-hmm.
- Why?

04:27.768 --> 04:29.067
- She don't seem like
the kinda chick

04:29.169 --> 04:30.802
who'll take it that well.

04:30.904 --> 04:34.072
You saw her
at the grocery store.

04:34.174 --> 04:36.975
- Yes?

04:37.578 --> 04:39.778
Yes, please send her up.

04:40.981 --> 04:42.748
- Oh God.

04:44.385 --> 04:46.551
- We are about to find out.

04:50.557 --> 04:52.557
- ♪ My girls hold me down ♪

04:52.660 --> 04:54.693

05:07.875 --> 05:10.142
- Well, this should
be interesting.

05:10.244 --> 05:12.244
- I shouldn't have invited her.

05:12.346 --> 05:15.147
- Well, it's kind of late
'cause you already did.

05:15.249 --> 05:18.083
- Well, Karen told me to.

05:19.553 --> 05:21.153
Karen, I know what
you're doing.

05:21.255 --> 05:22.821
- It's giving set up.
- Yeah, me too.

05:22.923 --> 05:26.191
- It's giving set up.
- It's very much set-up energy.

05:26.293 --> 05:29.961
- And what do you mean
by that, Andi?

05:30.064 --> 05:35.667
- I just mean...
Are you sure that Zac knows?

05:36.704 --> 05:39.471
- Wow. Okay.

05:39.573 --> 05:42.674
- Oh, Karen. Oh.

05:42.776 --> 05:44.910
Bitch, I gotta give it to you,
you about to tell her here.

05:45.012 --> 05:46.411
- No.

05:46.513 --> 05:48.747
- Yeah and you know Zac probably
didn't even tell her.

05:48.849 --> 05:53.485
- Karen, you cannot do this.
- I'm not doing anything.

05:53.587 --> 05:56.388
- What if she doesn't know?
Huh? You know what?

05:56.490 --> 05:59.291
I'm just gonna tell her not to
come up here. I'm gonna--

05:59.393 --> 06:01.460
- That's a good id--
- Stop, Andi.

06:01.562 --> 06:04.496
I'm not going to say anything
until I know what she knows.

06:04.598 --> 06:05.464
Let her come up.

06:05.566 --> 06:06.865
- You just gonna
flat-out ask her?

06:06.967 --> 06:09.067
- Yep.
- Hmm.

06:09.169 --> 06:12.170
- I don't like this.

06:13.340 --> 06:16.608
- You know what, Andi?
Let her come.

06:16.710 --> 06:18.243
- It's fine.

06:18.345 --> 06:20.278
She need to know what kind of
man she dealin' with.

06:20.381 --> 06:23.482
- Absolutely not.
I am stopping this.

06:23.851 --> 06:25.050
- Andi, Andi, Andi.
- What?

06:25.152 --> 06:26.985
- She's here now.

06:27.087 --> 06:29.688
Let it play out,
let it play out.

06:29.790 --> 06:31.022
She's probably
on the elevator.

06:31.125 --> 06:32.457
Let it play out.

06:32.559 --> 06:34.493
- Oh.

06:39.500 --> 06:43.335
It's wrong.
- I don't know about this.

06:43.437 --> 06:46.605
I don't have a good feeling
about this one.

06:46.707 --> 06:48.974
- Karen, you sure?

06:49.076 --> 06:50.909
'Cause I'm done with the
feelings, you know?

06:51.011 --> 06:53.845
I can't do feelings anymore.

06:53.947 --> 06:55.881
- We're not.
We're all adults.

06:55.983 --> 07:01.353
- Yeah, we are all adults,
but one of us is strapped.

07:01.455 --> 07:03.889
Wait a minute, did you check
this bitch?

07:03.991 --> 07:07.392
As a matter of fact, did you
check either of these bitches?

07:07.494 --> 07:10.228
- It's okay.
It's okay.

07:10.330 --> 07:11.863
Because we're gonna have a
really, really,

07:11.965 --> 07:16.001
really, really civil--

07:16.103 --> 07:19.471
civil conversation.
- Girl, please.

07:19.573 --> 07:20.806
- Karen?

07:20.908 --> 07:22.340
- What else would it be besides
a civil conversation?

07:22.443 --> 07:23.575
I just want to talk to her.

07:23.677 --> 07:26.678
- Can I hold your purse?
- No, you may not.

07:26.780 --> 07:29.414
- Okay.
- Yeah...

07:29.516 --> 07:32.851
- Go ahead.
Go get your girl.

07:32.953 --> 07:35.587
- Okay.
- Okay.

07:42.729 --> 07:47.165
- She's too calm.
She's, she's too calm.

07:47.267 --> 07:49.167
She's too calm.
I don't like this.

07:49.269 --> 07:50.569
- She is.
She's very, very calm.

07:50.671 --> 07:53.872
I don't like it.
- It's about to go down.

07:53.974 --> 07:56.374
It's gonna be some shit today.

07:56.477 --> 07:59.311
- Let's just...
see how it plays out.

07:59.413 --> 08:02.113
- Where's the nearest exit?
Um.

08:02.216 --> 08:06.451
- No. Stop.
- You know we're 30 floors up.

08:06.553 --> 08:09.588
Karen, you gonna throw this
bitch over the balcony?

08:09.690 --> 08:12.123
- Shh, now is not the time.
- Okay.

08:12.226 --> 08:14.526
- [elevator doors ding]

08:16.763 --> 08:18.163
- Hey.

08:18.265 --> 08:20.465
- Damn.

08:20.567 --> 08:23.034
Had I known we was coming over
someone else's house,

08:23.136 --> 08:24.836
I would've dressed
a little nicer.

08:24.938 --> 08:26.137
- You look great.

08:26.240 --> 08:29.241
Um, we'll talk about
that later.

08:29.343 --> 08:31.376
- Do I need to be scared, Andi?
What's going on?

08:31.478 --> 08:35.413
- How are you feeling?
Are you okay?

08:35.516 --> 08:37.182
'Cause you don't need
to be scared.

08:37.284 --> 08:42.587
Um, there may be some
information that's given

08:42.689 --> 08:44.422
I wasn't aware of.

08:44.525 --> 08:46.491
But fear, no.
You don't have to be scared.

08:46.593 --> 08:49.461
- What are you talking about?

08:49.563 --> 08:53.198
- Andi, no.
Bring her inside.

08:53.300 --> 08:54.499
- What's going on?

08:54.601 --> 08:57.502
- Nothing. I just wanna
talk to you.

08:57.604 --> 09:00.171
- Why didn't I see this coming?

09:00.274 --> 09:01.873
- Why didn't you see what?

09:01.975 --> 09:03.608
- Hey, girl.
You look great.

09:03.710 --> 09:05.343
Let me take your purse
for you, sugar.

09:05.445 --> 09:08.013
- No, I-I got it.

09:08.115 --> 09:10.382
- Okay, well I'm gonna sit over
here, all the way over here

09:10.484 --> 09:14.486
out of the line of fire.
Okay.

09:14.588 --> 09:18.156
- Okay, so does somebody want
to tell me what's going on?

09:18.258 --> 09:21.660
- Um, I just want
to apologize in advance.

09:21.762 --> 09:25.196
Um, if I had known,
I would not have invited you.

09:25.299 --> 09:28.733
So that's...
- Oh, really, Andi?

09:28.835 --> 09:30.001
- You kept me in the dark.

09:30.103 --> 09:32.804
- Are you sure you didn't
just stay there?

09:32.906 --> 09:35.073
- All right. Does somebody
want to tell me seriously,

09:35.175 --> 09:36.474
why am I here?

09:36.577 --> 09:39.878
- Sure. Why don't you
come sit down?

09:48.221 --> 09:52.724
- I'll stand.
- Um, I'm gonna sit.

09:54.561 --> 09:58.797
- I'm pregnant.
- Congratulations.

09:58.899 --> 10:00.865
- By Zac.

10:00.968 --> 10:05.003
- Yes.
He already told me.

10:05.105 --> 10:07.339
- He did?

10:07.441 --> 10:11.142
- Yeah. As soon as you told him,

10:11.244 --> 10:14.045
he came straight home
and told me.

10:14.147 --> 10:15.647
- Well, what'd you say?

10:15.749 --> 10:17.415
- What was I supposed to say?

10:17.517 --> 10:22.120
- Shit, they're gonna
kill you and her. I dunno.

10:22.222 --> 10:25.490
- Yeah, no.
We weren't exactly exclusive

10:25.592 --> 10:27.959
the last time you all had sex.

10:28.061 --> 10:32.664
I wasn't clear about how I felt
and neither was he,

10:32.766 --> 10:38.637
but now that we are clear,
he tells me everything.

10:38.739 --> 10:43.274
- I wouldn't believe that.
- Hmm.

10:43.377 --> 10:44.776
Maybe you're right.

10:44.878 --> 10:49.114
Maybe he's not telling me
everything. Hmm.

10:49.216 --> 10:52.684
- Does he tell you
how much he calls me?

10:52.786 --> 10:56.521
- No, he didn't.
- Almost every day.

10:56.623 --> 11:00.925
- Hmm, you know that,
that's strange to me.

11:01.028 --> 11:02.961
- Why is that strange?

11:03.063 --> 11:06.331
- Well, I have the password
to Zac's phone

11:06.433 --> 11:08.767
and I never see
your name pop-up.

11:08.869 --> 11:10.902
- Down goes mot.

11:11.004 --> 11:13.471
- Maybe he has another one.

11:13.573 --> 11:17.842
- He does.
And I have that password too.

11:19.346 --> 11:22.447
Um, is that why you
called me here?

11:22.549 --> 11:24.983
- Be careful.

11:25.085 --> 11:27.452
- Uh, and you're concerned why?

11:27.554 --> 11:28.987
- Oh, I'm absolutely
not concerned,

11:29.089 --> 11:32.724
but I know him very well.

11:32.826 --> 11:36.261
- Okay. Well, thank you for your
concern because you clearly are.

11:36.363 --> 11:37.729
- Not concerned, not concerned.

11:37.831 --> 11:40.765
- But um, if that's the only
reason I'm here,

11:40.867 --> 11:43.368
that, that's it?
I already knew that.

11:43.470 --> 11:46.438
- When the baby comes,

11:46.540 --> 11:49.274
his father will be
in his or her life.

11:49.376 --> 11:52.243
- I agree.

11:52.345 --> 11:55.980
- So you and I cannot
have issues.

11:56.083 --> 11:59.017
- None.

11:59.119 --> 12:02.487
But nine months is a long time.

12:02.589 --> 12:05.390
- What does that--
What does that mean?

12:05.492 --> 12:07.592
- It means a lot can happen
in that time.

12:07.694 --> 12:09.561
- Are you threatening me,
Fatima?

12:09.663 --> 12:11.529
- God, no, Karen. No.
- No?

12:11.631 --> 12:13.798
- Zac and I, we're new.

12:13.900 --> 12:17.769
And we think it's gonna work,
but only time will tell.

12:17.871 --> 12:22.407
- Mm-mm, see, don't--
Don't do that, Fatima.

12:22.509 --> 12:23.942
- What am I doing?

12:24.044 --> 12:26.511
- You-You're just saying that to
make her feel better.

12:26.613 --> 12:28.913
- Yeah, I'm definitely
not doing that.

12:29.015 --> 12:31.616
- You both know
he's crazy about your ass.

12:31.718 --> 12:35.320
- Mm-hmm.
And I'm crazy about him too.

12:35.422 --> 12:38.690
- So you know it's gonna work.

12:38.792 --> 12:43.495
- You didn't let me finish.
- Oh, okay. Go ahead.

12:43.597 --> 12:45.764
- We both think it's gonna work,

12:45.866 --> 12:50.168
but I think we should also
work on a paternity test.

12:50.270 --> 12:52.971
- We?
- Yes.

12:54.775 --> 12:56.708
- Are you suggesting
I'm lying, Fatima?

12:56.810 --> 13:00.345
- No, not at all,
but it couldn't hurt, right?

13:00.447 --> 13:04.649
- No, it couldn't.
- Okay. Good.

13:04.751 --> 13:07.485
So if that's the
only reason I'm here,

13:07.587 --> 13:08.720
then I'm just gonna go ahead

13:08.822 --> 13:10.088
and get out of your little
sister circle.

13:10.190 --> 13:11.422
- Okay. Bye, Fatima.
- Mm-hmm.

13:11.525 --> 13:15.160
- Karen, Karen...

13:15.262 --> 13:16.995
- Look.

13:24.304 --> 13:27.005
I'm...

13:27.107 --> 13:28.273
sorry.

13:28.375 --> 13:30.642
- ANDI: Karen.

13:30.744 --> 13:35.113
- He doesn't call me.

13:35.215 --> 13:38.650
I wanted you here because

13:38.752 --> 13:41.085
I wanted to hurt you.

13:44.191 --> 13:46.391
I ain't that mad at you.

13:46.493 --> 13:49.027
I don't really know you, so...

13:49.129 --> 13:53.131
It's about him and all the shit
that we went through.

13:53.233 --> 13:58.970
And now he wants to do good
and be with you.

14:00.106 --> 14:04.175
- Karen, I...
I get it.

14:04.277 --> 14:06.211
- We all do.

14:06.313 --> 14:10.715
- Yeah.
Look,

14:10.817 --> 14:14.686
we work so hard to make these
damn boys men.

14:14.788 --> 14:17.222
And then after all the struggle,
what do they do?

14:17.324 --> 14:20.024
Take everything they learned
to the next woman.

14:22.229 --> 14:24.395
Karen, I've been you.

14:24.497 --> 14:26.631
I have.

14:26.733 --> 14:29.601
And I don't want to hurt you
or try you.

14:29.703 --> 14:34.038
I actually wish you the best.

14:34.140 --> 14:38.042
And if this is Zac's baby...
- It is.

14:43.149 --> 14:47.619
- If this is Zac's baby,

14:47.721 --> 14:49.787
and he brings your child home,

14:49.889 --> 14:52.724
I would never
mistreat your child.

14:52.826 --> 14:55.860
That baby doesn't have shit
to do with this.

14:55.962 --> 14:58.896
But trust me, I feel you.

14:59.599 --> 15:02.233
- Okay.
- FATIMA: Okay.

15:06.506 --> 15:11.075
- Wait, Fatima.
Don't, don't leave,

15:11.177 --> 15:12.844
not like that.

15:12.946 --> 15:14.946
Hell, you're going
to be family now.

15:15.048 --> 15:19.817
You know, we got wine
and Cognac.

15:19.919 --> 15:23.554
- I'm gonna sit over there.
- Yeah, yeah, have a seat.

15:23.657 --> 15:25.123
You look nice.
- Thank you.

15:25.225 --> 15:29.727
- I could still take that.
- No, I got it.

15:30.830 --> 15:33.965
- This shit is all so unfair
to you and Karen.

15:34.067 --> 15:35.967
- Mm-hmm.
We just want to be loved.

15:36.069 --> 15:37.135
- Mm-hmm.

15:37.237 --> 15:40.138
- I'm so sick of men and
their shit, you know?

15:40.240 --> 15:45.043
- Yeah, think I'ma stay single
for a while.

15:45.145 --> 15:47.712
- That is a good idea.
I will join you.

15:47.814 --> 15:50.048
- You couldn't do it
if you tried.

15:50.150 --> 15:53.084
- Don't get mad at me because I
want to be loved

15:53.186 --> 15:57.288
and cared for
and made love to.

15:57.390 --> 15:59.991
- We all want that.
- Mm-hmm.

16:00.093 --> 16:02.627
- Shit's hard to find though.
- Mm-hmm.

16:02.729 --> 16:03.861
- Don't call me raggedy then.
- Yeah...

16:03.963 --> 16:07.598
- Oh no, ma'am.
[chuckles]

16:07.701 --> 16:10.668
You sit this one out. Okay?

16:10.770 --> 16:14.339
- What?
- You got the new Zac.

16:14.441 --> 16:17.141
- Yeah, but I had to do a lot of
patching him up.

16:17.243 --> 16:20.678
- And I'm sure you still do,
but you know what?

16:20.780 --> 16:26.017
Karen. Let's not... let's not.
- Yeah, let's not.

16:26.119 --> 16:29.020
Yeah. 'Cause apparently,
you've got a Zac that

16:29.122 --> 16:32.090
I ain't ever even met, so...
- Yeah, we didn't meet.

16:32.192 --> 16:34.225
- Mm-mm. I mean,
did he change that much?

16:34.327 --> 16:40.164
- Okay, no more Zac.
No more Zac talk.

16:40.934 --> 16:44.068
- Agreed.
We can drop Zac.

16:44.170 --> 16:45.770
- We already have to fight these
insta-hoes.

16:45.872 --> 16:47.839
We are not going down that
rabbit hole, okay?

16:47.941 --> 16:48.906
- Tell me about it.

16:49.008 --> 16:50.375
- He didn't even
look like that.

16:50.477 --> 16:52.910
- Even Tuscaloosa bitches.

16:53.012 --> 16:54.612
None of them look like that.

16:54.714 --> 16:56.080
You know that
shit's fake, right?

16:56.182 --> 17:00.017
- Yeah. And men fall for it.
- Every day.

17:00.120 --> 17:02.587
- Mm-hmm.
- Let's just get high.

17:02.689 --> 17:04.689
- Sure.
- See, that's a good plan.

17:04.791 --> 17:06.691
- That's good.

17:06.793 --> 17:09.727
- That's, if I can stay.

17:17.737 --> 17:20.204
- Sure.

17:21.241 --> 17:23.775
- Oh, but um,
don't mention Zac.

17:23.877 --> 17:25.843
- Let's see what else
Gary got me.

17:25.945 --> 17:29.514
Drinks anyone?
- Yes, please.

17:33.386 --> 17:35.119
- DANNI: Damn, this is nice.

17:41.728 --> 17:45.363
- So Andi, is this your new
place for real?

17:45.465 --> 17:49.834
- Um, I can tell you about that
another time.

17:49.936 --> 17:51.436
- We have a lot
to fill you in on.

17:51.538 --> 17:53.371
- I see.

17:53.473 --> 17:55.940
- Well, subject change.

17:56.042 --> 17:58.075
You know the guy who I thought
was a child trafficker?

17:58.178 --> 18:00.845
- Yeah.
- He's a cop, FBI agent.

18:00.947 --> 18:03.748
- What?
- Long story.

18:03.850 --> 18:08.753
Anyway, he's been asking me out
and I don't know.

18:08.855 --> 18:11.589
You know I like handcuffs.

18:11.691 --> 18:14.358
- Well, something happened
with Calvin the other day.

18:14.461 --> 18:16.294
- Oh, shit.

18:16.396 --> 18:19.697
- Wait.
What did I miss?

18:19.799 --> 18:21.933
- Yeah, Brina, we listening.

18:22.035 --> 18:23.968
- He got into a fight over me at
the restaurant.

18:24.070 --> 18:28.272
- Oh no, is he okay?
- What do you mean?

18:28.374 --> 18:32.410
- You know damn well
what she means.

18:32.512 --> 18:36.280
- He's fine.
- Sorry.

18:38.218 --> 18:41.986
Hey Fatima, any guy try to get
you back by buying a penthouse

18:42.088 --> 18:46.257
and a Rolls Royce?
- Girl, no.

18:47.260 --> 18:50.628
Wait a minute.
Andi, look at me.

18:50.730 --> 18:53.564
Did Gary buy all this?
- Mm-hmm.

18:53.666 --> 18:55.633
And put it in her name, girl.

18:55.735 --> 18:58.536
- Damn, girl.
What kinda -- you got?

18:58.638 --> 19:00.004
- I know, right?

19:00.106 --> 19:01.539
She should bottle it
and sell it.

19:01.641 --> 19:03.140
- Yeah.
- Wait a minute.

19:03.243 --> 19:05.309
You tell me.
Is she selling you?

19:05.411 --> 19:08.546
'Cause I will help you now.
I will save you.

19:08.648 --> 19:10.982
- Stop.

19:12.986 --> 19:14.819
- Could I get your old place?

19:14.921 --> 19:17.788
- No.
- Why the -- not?

19:17.891 --> 19:21.192
- We'll talk about it later.
Karen, are you okay?

19:21.294 --> 19:22.927
- Kinda tired.

19:23.029 --> 19:25.630
- I hear that one glass
a day is okay.

19:25.732 --> 19:28.533
The French do it.
- Danni, no.

19:33.940 --> 19:36.073
- [phone vibrating]

19:37.377 --> 19:39.577
- Hello.
- Hey.

19:39.679 --> 19:42.213
- Who is this?
- It's Jake.

19:42.315 --> 19:44.815
- Oh. What up?

19:44.918 --> 19:45.983
- Hey, look, I just wanted
to apologize

19:46.085 --> 19:47.818
for how Gary was acting.

19:47.921 --> 19:49.120
- Yeah, yeah, what's good
with that shit, man?

19:49.222 --> 19:50.755
He said people talking about me.

19:50.857 --> 19:55.693
- Zac.
- Well, nah, tell me bro.

19:55.795 --> 19:56.961
- When you invest
a small amount of money

19:57.063 --> 19:58.296
and that shit turns to millions,

19:58.398 --> 20:00.531
it's gonna raise
a couple of eyebrows.

20:00.633 --> 20:02.199
- What's that even mean, son?

20:02.302 --> 20:03.601
- Look, I'm not exactly sure
what he meant,

20:03.703 --> 20:06.203
but I can check in with
my contact at the SEC.

20:06.306 --> 20:08.172
- No, no, no,
don't... don't do that.

20:08.274 --> 20:11.475
I don't... I don't wanna raise
no more red flags.

20:11.578 --> 20:15.046
- No. No, no. This won't.
It's all legit, right?

20:15.148 --> 20:17.415
- Yeah, I told y'all --
it's was legit.

20:17.517 --> 20:19.550
I just put all the money
on the right horse.

20:19.652 --> 20:21.786
- Okay. Well, then that's all
they need to know.

20:21.888 --> 20:23.220
- All right. Good.

20:23.323 --> 20:26.090
- Yeah, no problem, but you
really should diversify.

20:26.192 --> 20:29.026
- What's that even mean, bro?
- Just buy some other stocks.

20:29.128 --> 20:31.729
Winners and losers, so the
heat's not on you.

20:31.831 --> 20:33.564
- I'm--blu--
I'm supposed to buy losers?

20:33.666 --> 20:35.800
- Man, you can't just win,

20:35.902 --> 20:37.702
unless you know some
shit I don't.

20:37.804 --> 20:39.003
- No, I don't.

20:39.105 --> 20:41.372
- Look, we'll talk
about it tomorrow.

20:41.474 --> 20:42.840
- Aight, you free?

20:42.942 --> 20:44.508
- Yeah, I'll come over
and help you paint.

20:44.611 --> 20:45.776
- Perfect.

20:45.878 --> 20:47.011
- Okay, yeah.
I'll text you tomorrow.

20:47.113 --> 20:49.480
- Yeah, all right.

20:52.085 --> 20:54.418
- Hey.
- Ah, there you go.

20:54.520 --> 20:56.153
- I'm fine.

20:56.255 --> 20:58.756
- I was about to put an APB out
on your ass.

20:58.858 --> 21:01.359
- I'm good.
I know how to hold my own.

21:01.461 --> 21:03.027
- I can tell.
Dressed in all black.

21:03.129 --> 21:05.429
- Yeah.
- So how did it go?

21:05.531 --> 21:10.234
- Zac, you know what?
I-I really like those girls.

21:10.336 --> 21:14.238
- Even Karen?
- Even Karen.

21:14.340 --> 21:17.842
- I mean, I guess she can be
sweet when she wanna be.

21:17.944 --> 21:20.244
- Yeah, she can be.

21:20.346 --> 21:22.713
She tried me though.
She did.

21:22.815 --> 21:25.116
- Really?
- Uh-huh.

21:25.218 --> 21:28.552
She didn't know that you had
told me that she was pregnant.

21:28.655 --> 21:31.756
- See? This is why I say
we should be talkin'

21:31.858 --> 21:33.257
to each other, right?
- Yes.

21:33.359 --> 21:35.359
- Can't nobody catch us off
guard and we know each other.

21:35.461 --> 21:37.361
- She tried to blindside my ass.

21:37.463 --> 21:40.264
- Mm-hmm. See, that's the
bullshit.

21:40.366 --> 21:44.035
I'm glad I missed all that.
- I handled it though.

21:44.137 --> 21:47.471
I sure did.
- What'd you do?

21:47.573 --> 21:51.609
- This time I just
said my peace.

21:51.711 --> 21:54.945
I just spoke.
That's it.

21:55.048 --> 21:57.081
- Is she gonna be
lookin' like Hayden?

21:57.183 --> 21:58.382
Come on, Fatima.
Stop playing.

21:58.484 --> 22:01.819
- Boy, shut up. No.
No, no. She's good.

22:01.921 --> 22:03.154
One piece.

22:03.256 --> 22:05.089
- All right. Good.
- Purpose.

22:05.191 --> 22:06.357
- At least everything
worked out.

22:06.459 --> 22:08.159
- Yeah, it did.

22:08.261 --> 22:10.628
- Everything didn't work out
here though.

22:10.730 --> 22:13.030
- What are you talkin' about?

22:13.132 --> 22:16.701
- Gary.
He uh...

22:16.803 --> 22:18.669
He just--
- You just say his name.

22:18.771 --> 22:19.970
- He's slick, he's slick.

22:20.073 --> 22:22.940
He uh, well, he tried to
get me to get you

22:23.042 --> 22:24.709
to get him and Andi
back together.

22:24.811 --> 22:29.046
And he said he would help me
if I made that happen.

22:29.148 --> 22:31.315
- Help him how?
- I don't know.

22:31.417 --> 22:36.053
He just talkin' about my name
is in all the wrong circles.

22:36.155 --> 22:37.922
He a sucka for that too.

22:38.024 --> 22:39.256
- What did he mean
by that though?

22:39.358 --> 22:40.791
- I don't know.
He wouldn't tell me.

22:40.893 --> 22:42.727
He was just like, you know.
You know how guys be talking.

22:42.829 --> 22:44.095
I can help you.

22:44.197 --> 22:45.830
I can help you with the names in
those circles.

22:45.932 --> 22:48.532
You know how he be talking.
- Yeah, you got that down. Yeah.

22:48.634 --> 22:51.635
- I'ma just ask Jake. Aight?

35:46.979 --> 35:50.947
They're gonna know you're here,
you know that?

35:51.049 --> 35:52.916
- Damn, you're right,
you're right, you're right.

35:53.018 --> 35:54.451
- That's why it's
called a tracker.

35:54.553 --> 35:56.086
- Maurice, please let me go back
to your house?

35:56.188 --> 35:57.754
Please let me go to your house.
- No!

35:57.856 --> 35:59.189
- You said all those
things to me.

35:59.291 --> 36:00.957
Was it a lie?
- All what things?

36:01.059 --> 36:03.760
- All those things
that helped me.

36:03.862 --> 36:04.961
- Que.

36:05.063 --> 36:06.763
- No, no, no.
I know you hear me.

36:06.865 --> 36:10.033
- You don't know shit.
- Maurice, please let me stay.

36:10.135 --> 36:11.835
- You tried to rob me.

36:11.937 --> 36:13.470
- And that's the worst
thing I've ever done

36:13.572 --> 36:17.340
in my entire life.
- Oh?

36:18.577 --> 36:22.012
- I'm sorry.
- Thank you.

36:22.114 --> 36:23.446
- Thank you.

36:23.549 --> 36:25.181
- You cannot stay
at my house, Que.

36:25.284 --> 36:28.785
- Please, man.
- No. I have a roommate.

36:28.887 --> 36:30.987
- Okay. I'll just stay
in your room.

36:31.089 --> 36:35.425
- As tempting as that sounds,
the answer is no.

36:35.527 --> 36:38.128
Now, go.
- Maurice.

36:38.230 --> 36:41.431
- Que, go!

36:44.436 --> 36:46.036
- You're gonna let
them send me back to jail?

36:46.138 --> 36:48.438
- You did the crime.

36:48.540 --> 36:51.608
- Maurice.
- Go.

36:51.710 --> 36:53.777
Bye.

36:54.246 --> 36:56.780
- What are you doing out?

36:56.882 --> 36:58.381
I'm calling the police.
- Okay.

36:58.483 --> 37:01.017
- She's serious.
You better go.

37:13.231 --> 37:16.533
- What's up?
- Yeah, man. I like it.

37:16.635 --> 37:19.536
- It's lookin' good, right?
- Yeah, when are you moving in?

37:19.638 --> 37:22.973
- I'm excited.
I'm thinking a couple of days.

37:23.075 --> 37:24.808
- Nice. Nice.

37:24.910 --> 37:28.945
- So um, did you find
any info out?

37:29.047 --> 37:31.982
- I found out that there's been
an inquiry to the SEC.

37:32.084 --> 37:35.552
- Damn.

37:35.654 --> 37:37.287
By who?

37:37.389 --> 37:41.324
- They didn't say, but
they're gonna contact you.

37:41.426 --> 37:43.827
- Damn.
Is that bad?

37:43.929 --> 37:49.265
- No. Just tell 'em
you had a hunch.

37:49.368 --> 37:51.434
- And that's all?

37:51.536 --> 37:53.870
- They're gonna ask you
a bunch of questions.

37:53.972 --> 37:58.675
Just tell them you've been
following the company.

37:59.745 --> 38:04.948
- All right, man.
- You have been, right?

38:05.050 --> 38:06.983
- Yes.

38:07.085 --> 38:10.286
- Zac, is there something
you want to tell me?

38:10.389 --> 38:15.125
- No.
- You sure?

38:15.227 --> 38:16.693
- Yeah, I'm good.

38:16.795 --> 38:20.697
- Because this is,
this is real lucky, man.

38:20.799 --> 38:25.602
- Listen, bro, I've been
following this company.

38:25.704 --> 38:30.674
- What were the margins
in 2015?

38:30.776 --> 38:34.344
- Who, who remember margins
from 2015?

38:34.446 --> 38:39.816
- Okay, then what about
six months ago?

38:39.918 --> 38:44.254
- Yeah, I can recall
six months, 'cause--

38:44.356 --> 38:45.922
- Ah, shit, look.

38:46.024 --> 38:48.892
We're gonna have to spend
some time together.

38:48.994 --> 38:50.060
- Why?

38:50.162 --> 38:52.629
- Because man, I've gotta
prepare you for this.

38:52.731 --> 38:54.330
With all the questions
they're gonna ask you,

38:54.433 --> 38:55.498
if you don't have the answers,

38:55.600 --> 38:58.068
that's gonna trigger
an investigation.

39:00.405 --> 39:03.707
- It's always something.
Okay, fine.

39:03.809 --> 39:06.609
- I don't know how you knew.
I don't wanna know.

39:06.712 --> 39:08.678
Just let me help you.

39:11.383 --> 39:13.917
- Why are you so interested
in helping me?

39:14.019 --> 39:16.486
- Come on, man.
You a good brother.

39:16.588 --> 39:19.556
Just let me help you.

39:19.658 --> 39:21.257
- Yeah, all right.

39:21.359 --> 39:24.527
- Look, I'm gonna pull all
the information, all right?

39:24.629 --> 39:28.631
All the records, the CFO
information, trades.

39:28.734 --> 39:29.833
We're gonna go over all of it.

39:29.935 --> 39:32.035
That way if they
do come for you,

39:32.137 --> 39:35.205
you'll be ready.

39:36.842 --> 39:39.375
- Why?

39:39.478 --> 39:41.311
- What do you mean?

39:41.413 --> 39:46.583
- Why are you all of a sudden
so interested in helping me?

39:46.685 --> 39:51.588
- I like you, man.
Look, it's all good.

39:54.893 --> 39:58.962

your back, please.

40:14.146 --> 40:15.645

What'd I do?

40:15.747 --> 40:17.347
- Don't make this more
difficult.

40:17.449 --> 40:20.884
- What, what?
This is some bullshit.

40:25.357 --> 40:27.457

It's where I belong.

40:27.559 --> 40:29.726

He just bought it for you?

40:29.828 --> 40:31.528

apology and ask you out.

see the timeline?

40:39.304 --> 40:41.437
- I will let you know when
I see the doctor, okay?

40:41.540 --> 40:43.840
- Do you know about Que?
- I don't wanna hear it.

40:43.942 --> 40:45.375
- Well, you need to.

40:45.477 --> 40:47.477
Because corporate know
you were involved.
