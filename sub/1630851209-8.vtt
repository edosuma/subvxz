00:02.089 --> 00:03.742
Sir, you need to see this.

00:08.878 --> 00:10.358
Mother of God.

00:10.401 --> 00:12.751
Double Feature.

00:12.795 --> 00:14.840
<i>All new.
Wednesdays at 10.</i>

00:14.884 --> 00:15.885
<i>On FX.</i>

00:24.459 --> 00:26.069
Today's a very special day.

00:26.113 --> 00:28.724
It's my master's Accession Day.

00:30.073 --> 00:31.596
<i>It's the anniversary</i>

00:31.640 --> 00:33.120
<i>of when he was crowned
Supreme Viceroy</i>

00:33.163 --> 00:34.860
for Al Qolnidar.

00:34.904 --> 00:36.906
So it's kind of a big deal.

00:36.949 --> 00:39.648
His favorite. Crepe-y paper.

00:39.691 --> 00:41.171
<i>Every year,
I try to do something special</i>

00:41.215 --> 00:42.999
<i>for the occasion.</i>

00:43.043 --> 00:44.044
<i>The whole house gets into it,</i>

00:44.087 --> 00:45.958
like, <i>really</i> into it.

00:49.049 --> 00:51.573
Yes! Oh, yeah!

00:51.616 --> 00:54.663
<i>Colin Robinson gets, uh,</i>

00:54.706 --> 00:56.099
a little too much into it.

01:34.398 --> 01:36.400
Ah...
- Oh, no.

01:36.444 --> 01:38.968
No. I-I don't think you should
be wearing that turban again.

01:39.011 --> 01:40.926
Well, I think you need to do
some research.

01:40.970 --> 01:42.319
'Cause not only is
this turban accurate

01:42.363 --> 01:44.930
to the ancient civilizations
of Persia,

01:44.974 --> 01:47.150
it also happens to be a gift
from my good friend,

01:47.194 --> 01:49.109
the Maharaja Duleep Singh.

01:49.152 --> 01:51.067
So if you have anything to say,

01:51.111 --> 01:53.200
- to either myself
or the maharaja...
- I just, it's not that.

01:53.243 --> 01:54.592
It was kept in storage
in the basement,

01:54.636 --> 01:56.638
and the rats were nesting
in there.

01:56.681 --> 01:57.856
Oh, right.

01:57.900 --> 01:59.467
Oh. Here it is.

01:59.510 --> 02:00.468
Let's go.

02:00.511 --> 02:02.165
Off you fuck.

It's your big Accession Day,
Master.

02:19.965 --> 02:21.924
- Did you forget?
- No.

02:21.967 --> 02:23.665
Okay.

02:23.708 --> 02:25.362
Well, it's just one of
those mornings, I guess.

02:25.406 --> 02:27.451
But the night's just beginning.

02:27.495 --> 02:29.192
I'll bet.
- Yay!

02:29.236 --> 02:31.673
I made you a little something,

Colin Robinson,
you can stop belly dancing.

02:42.858 --> 02:44.555
- He's not even in the room.
- I know.

02:44.599 --> 02:46.209
This is just for me.

02:47.689 --> 02:50.474
Another Accession Day.

03:04.053 --> 03:05.576
Believe it or
don't believe it, baby,

03:05.620 --> 03:08.449
but vampire depression is
the real fucking deal.

03:08.492 --> 03:10.059
The prospect of immortality

03:10.102 --> 03:12.017
can give some vampires
the shits.

03:12.061 --> 03:14.672
They hate the idea of staring
down life's eternal tunnel.

03:14.716 --> 03:16.805
What does it all mean?

03:16.848 --> 03:18.241
Nothing.

03:18.285 --> 03:20.635
<i>When a vampire is depressed,</i>

03:20.678 --> 03:22.898
<i>-the best treatment is
to avoid them at all costs.
Yeah.</i>

03:22.941 --> 03:25.161
<i>I'm 700 years old,</i>

03:25.205 --> 03:27.076
<i>and what have I got
to show for it?</i>

03:27.119 --> 03:29.644
<i>I'm a fully grown vampire,
and I still have roommates.</i>

03:29.687 --> 03:31.559
<i>I have no life partner.</i>

03:31.602 --> 03:33.561
<i>- I have no living children.</i>

03:33.604 --> 03:36.128
<i>I have no one to share my dreams
or my fears with.</i>

03:36.172 --> 03:38.218
Sorry, Nandor.
We were just...

03:38.261 --> 03:40.655
- I just have to check
something, um...
Hurry.

03:40.698 --> 03:42.657
<i>I mean, once you see
Colin Robinson belly dancing</i>

03:42.700 --> 03:44.006
<i>a few times,</i>

03:44.049 --> 03:46.443
the magic kind of wears off.

03:46.487 --> 03:47.662
<i>It doesn't matter that I'm</i>

03:47.705 --> 03:51.492
an infinitely powerful being.

03:51.535 --> 03:54.843
<i>- Doesn't mean anything
when you live for eternity.</i>

03:54.886 --> 03:58.542
Everything loses its meaning
when you live for eternity.

03:58.586 --> 04:00.631
<i>In all the years
I've known Nandor, I've...</i>

04:00.675 --> 04:02.242
I've never seen him like this.

04:02.285 --> 04:04.592
I think he might be having
a midlife crisis.

04:04.635 --> 04:07.247
But he's immortal, so I guess...

04:07.290 --> 04:09.858
maybe more like a crisis-crisis.

04:09.901 --> 04:12.164
Nandor's in crisis.

04:12.208 --> 04:14.036
So, everyone, we have

04:14.079 --> 04:16.778
a very important
Vampiric Council duty

04:16.821 --> 04:19.259
that I'm afraid is even too hard

04:19.302 --> 04:21.304
for my absolutely
amazing abilities.

04:21.348 --> 04:22.871
Someone hasn't paid

04:22.914 --> 04:24.829
their Vampiric Council
union fees in a while.

04:24.873 --> 04:26.831
Oh, no.

04:26.875 --> 04:30.052
Sometimes it is nice
to tiptoe in and remind Nandor

04:30.095 --> 04:32.489
that, uh, he's
very important vampire

04:32.533 --> 04:34.883
<i>with very important
jobs to do and...</i>

04:34.926 --> 04:37.189
<i>Also, collecting
Vampire Council dues</i>

04:37.233 --> 04:39.496
is basically vampire shit work.

04:39.540 --> 04:41.324
And I don't want to do it!

04:41.368 --> 04:43.413
But, you know,
more the first thing,

04:43.457 --> 04:46.286
that I want to raise
my-my friend up.

04:46.329 --> 04:48.244
So, who wants to tackle
this one?

04:48.288 --> 04:49.767
Well, I don't know, milady.

04:49.811 --> 04:52.553
Are you sure anyone here is up
for this task?

04:53.858 --> 04:56.644
Oh, shit. Um, yeah-- Oh.
No, my darling.

04:56.687 --> 04:58.994
I wouldn't be man enough?

04:59.037 --> 05:00.865
Hmm.

05:00.909 --> 05:02.432
O-Oh. Uh...

05:02.476 --> 05:04.347
I-I would love to help you out,

05:04.391 --> 05:09.309
but I, too, fear I'm not,
uh, man eno-- whatever.

05:09.352 --> 05:11.136
No, that's right.
You are very shit-stupid man,

05:11.180 --> 05:13.182
so you can't do it.

05:13.225 --> 05:15.271
How about you, Nandor?
Bill collection?

05:15.315 --> 05:17.012
Okay, fine. I'll do it.

05:17.055 --> 05:18.361
There you go. Yes!

05:18.405 --> 05:20.015
It's a very special job,

05:20.058 --> 05:22.365
- and we need the most...
- I said I'll do it!

05:22.409 --> 05:24.193
Give me that. Fuck!

05:24.236 --> 05:26.021
- Do you want me to come
with you?
- No!

05:33.507 --> 05:34.551
Ah.

05:34.595 --> 05:35.683
Oh, great.

05:35.726 --> 05:37.641
They have wellness vampires now.

05:46.215 --> 05:47.564
Um...

05:47.608 --> 05:49.523
You don't happen to know
where I could find

05:49.566 --> 05:51.525
someone called Jan, do you?

05:51.568 --> 05:52.917
Thanks very much.

05:52.961 --> 05:55.355
The fuck is that?

05:58.445 --> 06:00.925
- Come on, then.

06:00.969 --> 06:03.841
Stretch those out.
That's what I want to see, yes!

06:03.885 --> 06:07.932
Stretch those hammies,
feel the burn! Yes!

06:07.976 --> 06:11.501
Um...
- Oh, welcome.

06:11.545 --> 06:13.634
Sorry, I am just here for...

06:13.677 --> 06:15.462
Jan?

06:15.505 --> 06:18.334
Please join us,
bring your cameras.

06:18.378 --> 06:21.032
- No secrets here.
- Uh, no.

06:21.076 --> 06:25.428
- I am just here
for your debt collection.
- Take a seat.

06:25.472 --> 06:26.864
So...

06:26.908 --> 06:31.826
What do we love?

06:31.869 --> 06:33.480
To sweat.

06:33.523 --> 06:38.223
And how do we sweat?

06:38.267 --> 06:39.877
By dancing.

06:39.921 --> 06:42.750
And what do we say
to newcomers?

06:43.403 --> 06:48.103
Welcome. You must stretch
before you dance.

06:48.146 --> 06:52.020
Uh, like I said,
as I was standing over there,

06:52.063 --> 06:55.284
I am only here
to, uh, collect a debt

06:55.327 --> 06:58.983
for Vampire Council dues
you haven't paid in 132 years.

06:59.027 --> 07:01.986
Oh, you must be mistaken.

07:02.030 --> 07:03.988
No vampires here, pal.

07:05.468 --> 07:08.340
- But, you are Jan, yes?

07:08.384 --> 07:13.084
Yes, but I am no longer
a vampire.

07:14.521 --> 07:16.914
That's... Wow.

07:16.958 --> 07:20.614
Eesh. You have all pulled
your own fangs out.

07:20.657 --> 07:24.008
Very disturbing, uh,
but it does not negate the fact

07:24.052 --> 07:27.490
- that, uh, you owe a great sum.
- No sum to be paid, friend,

07:27.534 --> 07:30.972
for we are no longer vampires.

07:31.015 --> 07:35.672
We have become humans again.

07:35.716 --> 07:37.065
Mm-hmm.

07:37.108 --> 07:39.328
How is such a thing
even possible?

07:43.637 --> 07:47.423
Welcome.
Come on in, have a seat.

07:51.862 --> 07:53.516
Uh, no, thank you.

07:53.560 --> 07:56.650
As you know, being a vampire,
I cannot eat or drink.

07:56.693 --> 07:58.608
Poor you.

08:04.571 --> 08:06.398
Ah...

08:06.442 --> 08:10.185
How long have you been caught up
in this whole vampire trip?

08:10.228 --> 08:13.188
I have been a vampire
for over 700 years,

08:13.231 --> 08:17.061
- if that's what you're asking.
- Yes, but-- one second.

08:17.105 --> 08:18.976
No, no, no, no, no,
you need to select

08:19.020 --> 08:21.544
the Epson 4750
in the print queue window.

08:21.588 --> 08:23.546
Not the Bonjour printing.

08:23.590 --> 08:26.767
I am so sorry. One second.

08:30.640 --> 08:32.686
Ah... Tell me.

08:33.687 --> 08:37.691
Are you happy being a vampire?

08:37.734 --> 08:40.563
- I've had better days.
- What if I were to tell you

08:40.607 --> 08:42.260
that there's another way?

08:42.304 --> 08:45.046
A way that you can walk
into the sun.

08:45.089 --> 08:50.051
A way that you can
become human again.

08:51.052 --> 08:52.488
I'd say you were full of shit.

08:52.532 --> 08:56.971
Eh... Well, perhaps
this path isn't for you.

08:57.014 --> 08:59.930
This is a difficult
and treacherous path,

08:59.974 --> 09:02.585
but the rewards...

09:02.629 --> 09:07.416
the rewards are unspeakably...

09:07.459 --> 09:09.679
delicious.

09:23.127 --> 09:25.739
<i>So, after short deliberation...</i>

09:25.782 --> 09:27.305
Yes.

09:27.349 --> 09:29.699
...I have decided to join

09:29.743 --> 09:31.614
the Formerly Fanged.

09:31.658 --> 09:33.311
The brochure is
very persuasive.

09:33.355 --> 09:37.620
<i>I am skeptical by nature,
but this Jan,</i>

09:37.664 --> 09:40.710
she's really speaking to me,
you know?

09:40.754 --> 09:43.887
She also is incredibly beautiful
and has a rocking body.

09:43.931 --> 09:45.585
<i>So, you're renouncing
your vampirism</i>

09:45.628 --> 09:47.630
to go and try living as a human?

09:47.674 --> 09:49.676
- Yes. What part of that
is not clear?

09:49.719 --> 09:51.373
Well, how about the whole thing?

09:51.416 --> 09:53.201
You can't just pretend to be
a human, you knoblord.

09:53.244 --> 09:55.333
Pretending to be human is just
the first step.

09:55.377 --> 09:56.683
Well,
what is the second step?

09:56.726 --> 09:58.641
I'm not clear
on all the steps yet.

09:58.685 --> 10:00.600
Why are you dressed
like a Playmobil figurine?

10:00.643 --> 10:03.211
Because this is how I used
to dress when I was a human.

10:03.254 --> 10:05.300
This is all very stupid.

10:05.343 --> 10:08.042
Not to mention that we are the
leaders of the Vampiric Council!

10:08.085 --> 10:10.087
We're going to be a
laughingstock when they find out

10:10.131 --> 10:12.873
you've gone crying off to go
and play human dress-up.

10:12.916 --> 10:15.136
- Right?
- I mean, I personally
wouldn't laugh,

10:15.179 --> 10:16.790
but there are those who would.

10:16.833 --> 10:18.792
Well, you don't have to worry
about that anymore,

10:18.835 --> 10:20.924
because you'll never
see me again.

10:20.968 --> 10:23.405
- Give me that.

10:23.448 --> 10:24.798
Give me that!

10:24.841 --> 10:27.583
Have a great,
unenlightened eternity.

10:27.627 --> 10:28.889
Farewell!

10:28.932 --> 10:30.455
Auf Wiedersehen!

10:30.499 --> 10:32.762
Good night, Seattle,
and good mental health!

10:32.806 --> 10:35.069
- See ya.
- Master. Master?

10:35.112 --> 10:36.679
I get his room.

10:36.723 --> 10:38.159
Master, wait!

10:38.202 --> 10:39.639
As your official bodyguard,

10:39.682 --> 10:40.944
it's my duty to go with you
everywhere--

10:40.988 --> 10:42.250
I am no longer your master!

10:42.293 --> 10:44.078
I hereby relieve you
of your service.

10:44.121 --> 10:45.383
What?

10:45.427 --> 10:47.690
It is time for me
to find happiness.

10:47.734 --> 10:49.518
Well, I want to find happiness,
too!

10:49.561 --> 10:51.651
What do you think I've been
doing for the last 11 years?

10:51.694 --> 10:53.304
Oh, boy. Here we go again
with this shit.

10:53.348 --> 10:54.915
Why do you think I've lived
with you this whole time?

10:54.958 --> 10:57.961
Can you please...

10:58.005 --> 11:00.703
please turn me into a vampire
before you leave?

11:00.747 --> 11:02.792
So that after all these years,

11:02.836 --> 11:06.143
you and I both,
both can be happy.

11:15.936 --> 11:17.764
Guillermo.

11:17.807 --> 11:22.464
Despite my cold dead heart and
your "just okay" personality,

11:22.507 --> 11:26.686
I've grown to have
some affection for you.

11:26.729 --> 11:28.818
- Just a little bit,
but, you know...
- And I for you, Mas--

11:28.862 --> 11:30.385
Well, obviously.

11:30.428 --> 11:32.648
But vampirism is a curse,

11:32.692 --> 11:35.172
and I care for you too much

11:35.216 --> 11:38.523
to burden you with that.

11:38.567 --> 11:41.309
It would weigh too heavily
on my conscience.

11:42.484 --> 11:45.226
Boop.
There's that smile.

11:46.618 --> 11:49.317
Once a vampire...

11:49.360 --> 11:52.059
tonight, I am only a man.

11:53.538 --> 11:54.801
Dry your face.

11:54.844 --> 11:56.454
You look like a pair
of wet undies.

11:58.021 --> 11:59.544
As I can no longer fly,

11:59.588 --> 12:01.633
I will have
a nice evening stroll to Jan's.

12:01.677 --> 12:04.898
- Just a human man crossing
the street.
- C-Careful.

12:06.334 --> 12:08.118
Are you shitting me?!

12:08.162 --> 12:10.599
You can't just walk out
into the street like that.

12:10.642 --> 12:12.775
You have to look both ways.

12:12.819 --> 12:15.125
That's literally rule number one
of being human.

12:15.169 --> 12:16.910
It's a bad start.

12:16.953 --> 12:18.868
What the fuck am I gonna do
with this?

12:21.044 --> 12:23.830
It's been about a month
since... What's his name?

12:23.873 --> 12:25.657
Nandor!
Come on, Laszlo.

12:25.701 --> 12:27.572
Sorry.
Uh, since he buggered off.

12:27.616 --> 12:30.401
Nothing much has changed,
though, to be honest.

12:30.445 --> 12:33.100
One thing that has changed,
which is such a relief,

12:33.143 --> 12:35.276
is you don't have
this constant soundtrack

12:35.319 --> 12:37.147
of weeping in the house
the whole time.

12:37.191 --> 12:39.323
- We don't miss that, do we?
- No.

12:39.367 --> 12:42.109
So, I've moved
into Nandor's room.

12:42.152 --> 12:44.546
Uh, it's taken me awhile

12:44.589 --> 12:47.505
<i>-to get my scent on everything.</i>

12:47.549 --> 12:50.334
<i>Regular vampires have
no gastric system.</i>

12:50.378 --> 12:53.816
<i>Energy vampires do,
to annoy those around them</i>

12:53.860 --> 12:56.036
<i>and mark their territory.</i>

12:56.079 --> 12:57.907
<i>It's beginning to feel
like home.</i>

12:57.951 --> 12:59.822
It's been kind of tough,
honestly.

12:59.866 --> 13:02.390
You know, I've known Nandor
for a long time,

13:02.433 --> 13:05.654
and now he's not in my life
anymore.

13:05.697 --> 13:08.048
<i>He didn't even leave an address
or anything,</i>

13:08.091 --> 13:09.745
which is hurtful.

13:09.789 --> 13:12.530
I mean, I guess know now
how it feels.

13:12.574 --> 13:14.619
All the times I left or quit.

13:14.663 --> 13:16.839
I just never thought that...

13:16.883 --> 13:20.408
that he'd be the one,
you know, to leave, so...

13:20.451 --> 13:23.541
<i>I'm just sorry that
we couldn't make him happy,</i>

13:23.585 --> 13:25.674
<i>and I hope he's happy now.</i>

16:10.317 --> 16:12.362
What are you doing

16:12.406 --> 16:14.234
Nandor must have left
some kind of clue somewhere,

16:14.277 --> 16:16.279
telling us where he's at
or where he's going.

16:16.323 --> 16:18.194
Like, maybe this pamphlet

16:18.238 --> 16:20.022
that's just sitting out
in the open?

16:20.066 --> 16:23.025
"In case any of you dumb,
idiot assholes care--"

16:23.069 --> 16:24.548

16:24.592 --> 16:26.463
"where I've gone, it's here."

16:26.507 --> 16:28.117
Give me that.

16:28.161 --> 16:29.640
All right, but you may want
to wash your hands.

16:29.684 --> 16:32.252
That has a full room
of butt wind on it.

16:32.295 --> 16:34.819
Don't want to get pink eye,
or maybe you do, I don't know.

16:34.863 --> 16:36.430
Don't really give a shit.

<i>Jan says that she has never seen

16:45.178 --> 16:47.267

16:47.310 --> 16:48.529
Don't mind me.

16:48.572 --> 16:50.183
Yeah!

16:50.226 --> 16:52.750
<i>So she has given me
a promotion of sorts.</i>

16:52.794 --> 16:54.883
I am now her number two.

- How do I look?
- Perfect.

- If I wasn't a human,

20:44.939 --> 20:47.768
I'd be crushing your dick
and slamming it on the floor.

20:47.811 --> 20:50.727
- You're not a human.
- Get off me! Ah! That tickles.

20:50.771 --> 20:53.077
- You've been brainwashed.

20:53.121 --> 20:54.383
Where are you taking me?

20:54.427 --> 20:56.255
- I'm taking you home!

20:56.298 --> 20:58.300
Don't want to be out here.
I want to be in there with Jan!

20:58.344 --> 20:59.823
<i>You want to be home
with us.
Get in the van.</i>

20:59.867 --> 21:01.129
<i>That's where you want to be,
okay?</i>

21:01.172 --> 21:02.826
<i>I didn't need rescuing.</i>

21:02.870 --> 21:04.437
<i>I was having a great time
back there</i>

21:04.480 --> 21:06.047
<i>till you came
and kicked everyone's ass.</i>

21:06.090 --> 21:07.396
<i>They were trying to kill me!</i>

21:07.440 --> 21:08.528
<i>They pulled all their fangs out.</i>

21:08.571 --> 21:10.269
<i>No one's going to bite you.</i>

21:10.312 --> 21:13.010
<i>We're a gentle people,
a gentle human people.</i>

21:13.054 --> 21:15.186
You're not a human, Master!

21:15.230 --> 21:17.754
I'm not?
Then how do you explain this?

21:17.798 --> 21:20.104
♪ <i>It's been one week
since you looked at me♪</i>

21:20.148 --> 21:21.976
♪ <i>Cocked your head to the side
and said, "I'm angry"♪</i>

21:22.019 --> 21:23.717
♪ <i>Five days since
you laughed at me.♪</i>

21:23.760 --> 21:25.545
I know the whole fucking song.

21:25.588 --> 21:28.069
I'd say that was pretty
gosh-darn human, wouldn't you?

21:28.112 --> 21:29.157
You've been brainwashed.

21:29.200 --> 21:30.767
Brainwashed, "shmain-washed."

21:30.811 --> 21:33.161
You know, this is exactly
what Jan warned us

21:33.204 --> 21:35.076
that the nonbelievers
would accuse us of.

21:35.119 --> 21:36.556
You've been brainwashed,
but it's okay,

21:36.599 --> 21:38.688
because we are going
to deprogram you.

21:38.732 --> 21:41.082
- Stop. Let it go.

21:41.125 --> 21:43.563
Did you not think for a second--
Listen to me!

21:43.606 --> 21:45.565
Did you ever consider
for one moment

21:45.608 --> 21:49.264
that I might be happy
for the first time in decades?

21:49.308 --> 21:51.310
Decades!

21:51.353 --> 21:54.791
That I found somewhere
where I feel that I belong?

21:54.835 --> 21:57.664
That makes me feel
useful and powerful

21:57.707 --> 21:59.709
in ways I've never felt.

21:59.753 --> 22:01.320
Never!

22:01.363 --> 22:03.278
Not in 700 years.

22:03.322 --> 22:05.019
Did you ever consider that?

22:06.150 --> 22:08.588
- No.
- No.

22:10.285 --> 22:11.678
So what I'm going to do now is

22:11.721 --> 22:13.332
I'm going to get
out of this car,

22:13.375 --> 22:15.856
and I'm going to go and get
a taxi or a bus

22:15.899 --> 22:18.162
or subway or Lyft or Uber,

22:18.206 --> 22:22.253
and I'm gonna go back
to my human community.

22:22.297 --> 22:24.168
And that is that.

22:25.909 --> 22:28.434
When did you install
silver rope-lined seat belts

22:28.477 --> 22:30.131
in this little shitbox?

22:30.174 --> 22:32.655
Sorry, Master.
It's for your own good.

22:41.098 --> 22:42.883
You guys, you guys.

22:42.926 --> 22:44.363
Catch your breath, boy.

22:44.406 --> 22:45.494
I think I did something
really drastic.

22:45.538 --> 22:47.017
Oh, you pierce your pee-pee?

22:47.061 --> 22:48.758
- No, but--
Tattoo your pee-pee?

22:48.802 --> 22:50.804
- You guys--
- Tell us more
about your pee-pee.

22:50.847 --> 22:52.109
You've never been
so interesting.

22:52.153 --> 22:53.415
Stop talking about
my pee-pee, okay?

22:53.459 --> 22:54.198
I didn't do anything
to my pee-pee!

22:55.417 --> 22:56.592
Okay, just trust that what I did

22:56.636 --> 22:58.159
I had to do, okay?
Do you trust me?

22:58.202 --> 22:59.639
No.
No.
No.

23:06.689 --> 23:09.997
Who the fuck is that?
Oh, my-- ew!

23:10.040 --> 23:12.129
What the hell?

23:12.173 --> 23:14.001
I'd say he's been brainwashed.

23:14.044 --> 23:15.829
Right, okay,
Colin Robinson,

23:15.872 --> 23:17.439
go to the council library
and see if there's

23:17.483 --> 23:19.441
any literature on
the art of deprogramming.

23:19.485 --> 23:21.138
- No, there's no need to
do that, Colin Robinson,

23:21.182 --> 23:23.010
because I am not brainwashed.
I am perfectly sane.

23:23.053 --> 23:25.491
I was just having fun
with my new friends.

23:25.534 --> 23:28.450
That's, uh, basically
what Patricia Krenwinkel said.

23:28.494 --> 23:30.713
Open your mouth. Good Lord,
he's pulled his fangs out.

23:30.757 --> 23:33.324
- No, no. No, no, no,
it's not what you think.

23:33.368 --> 23:35.544
- Nandor!
You stay in there,
old pal,

23:35.588 --> 23:37.546
and I'll go and find someone

23:37.590 --> 23:39.548
to mend that fucked-up brain
of yours.

23:39.592 --> 23:41.289
No, there's no need to do that.

23:41.332 --> 23:43.509
- Laszlo? Guillermo?
Please. Come on.
- I'm sorry.

23:43.552 --> 23:45.728

Hi, handsome.

<i>It's a completely different

26:38.379 --> 26:39.467

Nobody can know about him.

26:51.566 --> 26:52.959

have to take sides.
