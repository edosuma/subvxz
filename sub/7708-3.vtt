[cow mooing on TV]

00:03.804 --> 00:05.537
Mind if I change the channel?

00:05.539 --> 00:07.506
Shh, I'm watching something.

00:07.508 --> 00:09.608
Thanks. You're a champ.
Hand me the remote.

00:09.610 --> 00:13.012
- No.
- But I've seen this before.

00:13.014 --> 00:18.517
The guy gets gang-hoofed by
a bunch of really stupid cows.

00:18.519 --> 00:22.187
- ALF.
- Okay, they're smart cows.

00:22.189 --> 00:25.657
They just freak in large groups.

00:25.659 --> 00:27.092
Would you be quiet?

00:27.094 --> 00:28.360
You're not getting your way

00:28.362 --> 00:30.596
just because you spoiled
the end of my movie.

00:30.598 --> 00:32.031
I didn't spoil it.

00:32.033 --> 00:34.533
It ends with his girlfriend
going insane

00:34.535 --> 00:37.369
and singing about corn.

00:37.371 --> 00:40.139
It was Shelley Winters'
finest moment.

00:40.141 --> 00:44.810
- ALF!
- But "Crime Stoppers" is on.

00:44.812 --> 00:48.747
I am not watching
"Crime Stoppers" again.

00:48.749 --> 00:50.749
What's wrong with a show
that asks its viewers

00:50.751 --> 00:54.119
to hunt down dangerous felons
for a buck?

00:54.121 --> 00:56.155
It's base and demeaning.

00:57.525 --> 01:01.960
Well, excuse me,
Miss Brideshead Revisited.

01:01.962 --> 01:05.064
Okay. Here. You win.

01:05.066 --> 01:07.066
You always win.

01:09.303 --> 01:11.370
Nice kid,
but she's got no taste.

01:11.372 --> 01:14.706
Our next suspect has left
a trail of broken hearts

01:14.708 --> 01:18.544
and empty bank accounts,
all across this country.

01:18.546 --> 01:20.746
Not another TV evangelist.

01:22.016 --> 01:25.084
Our suspect is wanted
for polygamy and fraud.

01:25.086 --> 01:27.719
He was last seen in Tallahassee
seven years ago

01:27.721 --> 01:30.422
'after marrying at least
eight different women'

01:30.424 --> 01:31.657
'and bilking them out of'

01:31.659 --> 01:34.126
hundreds of thousands
of dollars.

01:34.128 --> 01:35.994
Have you seen him?

01:35.996 --> 01:37.729
Yeah!

01:37.731 --> 01:40.399
He's in the kitchen.

02:45.266 --> 02:48.600
Victims who have come forward
have described our suspect

02:48.602 --> 02:52.371
as anything from boring
to nondescript.

02:52.373 --> 02:56.275
I knew it. I knew it. I knew
Willie was hiding something.

02:56.277 --> 02:57.809
The way he keeps to himself

02:57.811 --> 03:01.013
pretending he doesn't enjoy
our company.

03:01.015 --> 03:02.981
But I always thought
if Willie was a criminal

03:02.983 --> 03:06.852
he'd be one of those
quiet sniper types.

03:06.854 --> 03:10.155
(man on TV)
'The state of Florida
is offering a $10,000 reward'

03:10.157 --> 03:12.724
'for information
leading to his capture.'

03:13.894 --> 03:15.961
Do you really think it's Willie?

03:15.963 --> 03:18.230
Well, add up the clues.
Look at the guy.

03:18.232 --> 03:22.701
Same weak chin, same
high forehead, same slopy eyes.

03:23.904 --> 03:26.205
Apparently, some women found it
a noble chin

03:26.207 --> 03:30.175
a classic forehead
and bedroom eyes.

03:30.177 --> 03:32.477
What are you,
starting to fall for him?

03:32.479 --> 03:35.214
No, honey. However, if he is
the man they're looking for

03:35.216 --> 03:38.116
he must have something
women want.

03:38.118 --> 03:39.885
And maybe,
if you asked Willie nicely

03:39.887 --> 03:42.521
he'd show you what it is.

03:42.523 --> 03:43.989
What's that supposed to mean?

03:43.991 --> 03:45.958
Well, it wouldn't hurt
for you to learn something

03:45.960 --> 03:47.993
about romancing
the opposite sex.

03:47.995 --> 03:50.629
I'm already married.
Why bother?

03:50.631 --> 03:53.632
- You're such a lug.
- Oh, yeah?

03:53.634 --> 03:57.536
Well, maybe this lug is just
gonna call that 800 number

03:57.538 --> 04:01.240
and claim his $10,000 reward.

04:01.242 --> 04:04.409
Willie Tanner, or whoever he is
this week, is our friend.

04:04.411 --> 04:09.281
He has never done anything
to us, and particularly to me.

04:09.283 --> 04:12.684
And until he does,
we're gonna leave him alone.

04:15.055 --> 04:17.923
(man on TV)
'If you have any information
on our suspect'

04:17.925 --> 04:21.026
we ask that you
not confront him directly.

04:21.028 --> 04:25.464
Warning a suspect will likely
put him back on the run.

04:25.466 --> 04:27.532
I can't believe it!

04:27.534 --> 04:30.602
My Willie, a stud?

04:30.604 --> 04:32.004
Yeah!

04:32.973 --> 04:36.942
But what if Willie is this guy?

04:36.944 --> 04:40.379
Will I turn him in or hide him?

04:40.381 --> 04:43.849
The high road or the low road?

04:43.851 --> 04:47.052
Oh, why can't things
ever be black or white?

04:48.489 --> 04:50.155
Hi, ALF.
What you watchin'?

04:50.157 --> 04:52.157
Uh, nothing that had to do
with your father

04:52.159 --> 04:54.259
if that's what you're implying.

04:54.261 --> 04:56.895
- Okay.
- But since you brought it up..

04:56.897 --> 05:00.432
- How is your father?
- I guess he's fine.

05:00.434 --> 05:03.502
You have any brothers or sisters
you don't know about?

05:03.504 --> 05:06.905

the catnip again?

05:06.907 --> 05:08.774
No, I'm fine, I'm fine.

Just wanna know, how long have
you known your cad? Dad, dad!

05:12.646 --> 05:15.914
- All my life, I guess.
- Is that right.

05:15.916 --> 05:17.716
What about when you were
between the ages

05:17.718 --> 05:20.519
of, say, zero and three?

05:20.521 --> 05:22.554
Those years
are pretty much a blur.

05:22.556 --> 05:25.791
Ah-ha! So it's possible!

05:25.793 --> 05:27.225
He may have gone on side trips

05:27.227 --> 05:30.429
to a place called Tallahassee,
for instance.

05:31.832 --> 05:34.132

05:34.134 --> 05:36.401
Yeah. Nice jawing with ya.

05:38.205 --> 05:40.305
- What's with him?
- Beats me.

05:40.307 --> 05:42.908
He's been acting
really weird lately.

05:42.910 --> 05:45.043
- Hey, Lynn.
- Hmm?

05:45.045 --> 05:48.113
Has your father ever left
for long periods of time

05:48.115 --> 05:50.349
then come back with less energy

05:50.351 --> 05:54.753
pockets full of money,
and a big smile on his face?

05:54.755 --> 05:58.056
Why didn't I go away to college?

05:58.058 --> 06:00.425
Well, the kids are a wash.

06:00.427 --> 06:04.062
And I can't ask Willie about it
or he'll skip town

06:04.064 --> 06:08.900
leaving me with Kate,
a woman scorned.

06:08.902 --> 06:13.305

- Oh.

06:31.959 --> 06:33.892
Well, since you're having
trouble sleeping

06:33.894 --> 06:37.028
have you ever thought
about changing your appearance?

06:37.030 --> 06:40.699
[sighs]
No, I haven't.

06:40.701 --> 06:42.234
Go away.

06:50.277 --> 06:52.377
- ALF?
- Yeah?

06:53.814 --> 06:56.848
Why did you just put
a wig on my head?

06:56.850 --> 06:58.550
Pretty natural, huh?

07:01.188 --> 07:03.288
Why are you doing this to me?

07:03.290 --> 07:08.026
You know what they say, Willie,
it's the wig that makes the man.

07:08.028 --> 07:10.095
I'm not wearing a wig.

07:11.131 --> 07:14.466
- Certainly not that one.
- Okay.

07:14.468 --> 07:17.269
Then perhaps these glasses
would enhance

07:17.271 --> 07:20.705
your already
ruggedly-handsome face

07:20.707 --> 07:23.675
- ALF.
- Alright, then try these.

07:23.677 --> 07:27.579
You know what they say
about men with big ears..

07:29.316 --> 07:32.317
What-what are you doing
with all this stuff?

07:32.319 --> 07:36.855
Well, you wanna look dapper
for that cruise, don't you?

07:36.857 --> 07:39.558
- Cruise?
- Yes, Willie Tanner.

07:39.560 --> 07:43.428
You have won a luxury cruise
to the Bahamas!

07:43.430 --> 07:44.930
A cruise?

07:44.932 --> 07:48.600
You mean you won
a radio contest or something?

07:48.602 --> 07:50.402
Yeah, that works.

07:52.139 --> 07:55.173
Of course, it doesn't include
airfare, meals, gratuities

07:55.175 --> 07:57.542
or the actual cruise itself.

07:57.544 --> 08:00.445
Go out the back way.

08:00.447 --> 08:04.115
The only place I'm going
is to take a nap.

08:04.117 --> 08:08.453
Good, then wear the ears.
You'll sleep better.

No, Willie doesn't
live here anymore.

He's, uh, he's in the Bahamas,
diving for spare change.

Hey, he's
following his dream. Bye.

08:36.884 --> 08:39.784
- Who were you just talking to?
- Uh, no one.

08:39.786 --> 08:41.620
I know what you were doing,
you were checking up

08:41.622 --> 08:43.154

08:43.156 --> 08:45.056
So what if I was?

08:45.058 --> 08:48.126
Trevor, you leave
that man alone.

08:48.128 --> 08:51.296
- Did he ask about me?
- No.

He disguised his voice and
said he moved to the Bahamas.

08:54.635 --> 08:57.435

08:57.437 --> 09:03.275
Well, then that means
that he's guilty of.. Ooh!

09:03.277 --> 09:05.210
- That does it.
- What are you doing?

09:05.212 --> 09:08.179
- You are not turning him in.
- Be strong, Raquel.

09:08.181 --> 09:12.150
Don't give in to your urges.
You never have in the past.

09:12.152 --> 09:15.086
Then I refuse to be a party
to this.

on face transplants.

No, I'm quite happy with mine,
thank you.

It's for a friend.

- ALF.
- I'll call you back.

09:46.787 --> 09:52.924

about...face transplants?

09:52.926 --> 09:56.328
Well, I thought it'd be nice to
see some new faces around here.

- Yes, dear.

10:07.240 --> 10:09.441
Have you seen my shoes?

10:09.443 --> 10:13.311
- What, the brown wingtips?
- No. Any of them?

10:13.313 --> 10:15.847
They're all<i> gone.</i>

10:15.849 --> 10:18.984
Now you can stay around
the house and out of trouble.

10:18.986 --> 10:22.754
I know, let's spend the day
in the middle of the room

10:22.756 --> 10:25.590
and stay away from the windows.

10:27.628 --> 10:29.060

10:31.531 --> 10:34.733
- Get me my shoes.
- I can't.

10:34.735 --> 10:38.203
Get me my shoes.

10:38.205 --> 10:40.939
Trust me.
You have beautiful feet.

10:40.941 --> 10:43.141
Display them proudly.

10:54.921 --> 10:56.921
These gentlemen are here
to see you.

10:56.923 --> 10:59.658
They say they're from...the FBI.

10:59.660 --> 11:01.593
FBI?

11:01.595 --> 11:02.827
Mind if we come in, sir?

11:02.829 --> 11:06.131
- No, of course not.
- What is this about?

11:06.133 --> 11:08.299
Can I tell them?
Can I tell them?

11:08.301 --> 11:10.335
Go ahead. Knock yourself out.

11:10.337 --> 11:11.703
Uh, we'd like you
to come downtown

11:11.705 --> 11:13.638
and answer the charges
of embezzlement

11:13.640 --> 11:18.076
interstate trafficking, fraud,
and here's the biggie, polygamy.

11:18.078 --> 11:19.678
Get your shoes.

11:21.314 --> 11:23.515
Polygamy? That-that is absurd.

11:23.517 --> 11:25.717
You obviously
have the wrong man.

11:25.719 --> 11:28.887
Oh, well, then it's our mistake.
Sorry for the trouble.

11:28.889 --> 11:31.089
We'll be on our way.

11:31.091 --> 11:34.492
See, everybody thinks
we're just all business.

11:35.962 --> 11:37.662
Where could you possibly
get the idea

11:37.664 --> 11:40.532
that I could ever be guilty
of any of those things?

11:40.534 --> 11:42.033
Somebody matching
your description

11:42.035 --> 11:44.569
was plastered all over
"Crime Stoppers" last night.

11:44.571 --> 11:47.572
A greedy viewer turned you in.

11:47.574 --> 11:49.140
What's going on?

11:49.142 --> 11:50.475
These men are from the FBI.

11:50.477 --> 11:55.180
They seem to think
I resemble somebody they want.

11:55.182 --> 11:58.650
Is it someone
who comes from Tallahassee?

11:58.652 --> 12:00.652
What do you know
about Florida, son?

12:00.654 --> 12:04.189
Uh, somebody asked me
if dad had ever been there.

12:05.792 --> 12:08.893
Ah, now I'm beginning
to understand

12:08.895 --> 12:11.830
the source of the confusion.

12:11.832 --> 12:13.865
So could you clue us in?

12:13.867 --> 12:16.367
Actually, no, I can't.

12:16.369 --> 12:19.003
- Would you come with us?
- Oh, is that really necessary?

12:19.005 --> 12:21.372
I mean, couldn't you just leave
a questionnaire behind

12:21.374 --> 12:24.275
or something?
I-I-I swear I'll be honest.

12:24.277 --> 12:25.677
It isn't gonna work.

12:25.679 --> 12:28.179
We know all about
the Bahamian getaway.

12:28.181 --> 12:31.082
How'd you know about that?
I mean.. What?

12:31.084 --> 12:32.517
Oh, I mean..

12:33.754 --> 12:35.787
Never mind.

12:35.789 --> 12:37.188
Let's go.

12:37.190 --> 12:38.423
Aren't you gonna
take your shoes?

12:38.425 --> 12:40.658
I don't have any.

12:40.660 --> 12:43.461
Next Father's Day,
you ought to drop a hint.

12:44.931 --> 12:47.132
[door closes]

12:47.134 --> 12:49.334
Willie's been caught.

12:49.336 --> 12:52.270
Kate thinks I turned him in.

12:52.272 --> 12:56.274
I'm gonna end up hung by my neck
in a Chinese deli.

12:56.276 --> 12:58.610
(Kate)
'ALF, get in here!'

13:03.917 --> 13:06.551
[instrumental music]

13:08.622 --> 13:09.888
Okay.

13:09.890 --> 13:12.423
I'll give you two hints,
and then that's it.

13:12.425 --> 13:15.894
"Irreconcilable Differences,"
"The Main Event."

13:15.896 --> 13:17.695
Oh. I got it.

13:17.697 --> 13:21.266
- Bad Shelley Long movies.
- Nope.

13:21.268 --> 13:24.369
- Okay, I give up.
- Bad Ryan O'Neal movies.

13:24.371 --> 13:26.805
- Oh.
- "Paper Moon."

13:26.807 --> 13:28.173
No, that was a good one.

13:28.175 --> 13:31.643
- "Oliver's Story."
- Ooh!

13:31.645 --> 13:34.712
"Fever Pitch," "Partners,"
"So Fine."

13:34.714 --> 13:38.416
Oh, shoot me
and get it over with.

13:38.418 --> 13:40.685
Nobody's shooting anybody yet.

13:40.687 --> 13:42.220
Just wait in here
with the others.

13:42.222 --> 13:44.756
We'll process you
as soon as we can.

13:44.758 --> 13:45.957
Others?

13:47.527 --> 13:48.860
Hello.

13:56.436 --> 13:59.904
Oh, who threw their gum
on the floor?

13:59.906 --> 14:01.339
[groans]

14:05.846 --> 14:07.011
ALF?

14:14.120 --> 14:16.187
[gasps]

14:16.189 --> 14:18.756
Too bad this isn't a pine box.

14:18.758 --> 14:21.559
Could we discuss this
after you've calmed down

14:21.561 --> 14:25.063
and I've had time
to make travel arrangements?

14:25.065 --> 14:27.398
ALF, I don't understand you.

14:27.400 --> 14:29.667
Did I mention I'm a bleeder?

14:31.338 --> 14:32.770
How could you do this to Willie

14:32.772 --> 14:35.607
after all the things
that he's done for you?

14:35.609 --> 14:38.676
I knew you'd finger me.
Hence the box.

14:38.678 --> 14:42.680
But you're wrong, Kate.
I didn't turn him in.

14:42.682 --> 14:44.616
Friends?

14:44.618 --> 14:46.985
You saw the show,
you grilled Lynn and Brian

14:46.987 --> 14:50.955
you jumped to conclusions,
and somebody did call the FBI.

14:50.957 --> 14:53.358
Well, sure, when you group them
all together like that

14:53.360 --> 14:54.959
it sounds bad.

14:54.961 --> 14:57.829
But I was only trying
to keep him from running away.

14:58.932 --> 15:02.500
Willie is not a polygamist.

15:02.502 --> 15:04.702
Oh, sure, Kate!

15:04.704 --> 15:08.172
But just in case
he's gone forever

15:08.174 --> 15:10.008
we still have his memories.

15:10.010 --> 15:11.643
And his house.

15:11.645 --> 15:14.779
And we can find a way to keep it
if you agree to work nights.

15:16.349 --> 15:20.485
I cannot talk to you now.
I am too mad!

15:20.487 --> 15:22.186
Is that 24-hour mad

15:22.188 --> 15:26.491
or dissect-the-alien mad?

15:26.493 --> 15:29.060
If you wake up, you'll know.

15:31.097 --> 15:32.563
[groans]

15:35.936 --> 15:39.837
Um, excuse me,
uh, do you have a moment?

15:41.141 --> 15:42.407
[scoffs]

15:42.409 --> 15:46.878
- How.. Yeah. What is it?
- Well..

15:46.880 --> 15:48.913
The guys and I were wondering
if you wanted

15:48.915 --> 15:50.381
to get in on our pool?

15:50.383 --> 15:52.450
- What are you betting on?
- Oh, ha.

15:52.452 --> 15:55.486
Well, which one of us,
if any, is guilty.

15:55.488 --> 15:57.622
Costs $5 to buy in.

15:57.624 --> 16:02.193
Uh, I'm not sure that that
would really be appropriate.

16:02.195 --> 16:03.895
Can you vote for yourself?

16:05.231 --> 16:06.764
I'm in.

16:10.070 --> 16:12.937
Tanner? Your story checked.
You're free to go.

16:12.939 --> 16:16.140
What a relief. Kate must be
worried sick by now!

16:16.142 --> 16:17.775
Hey, wait, wait!

16:17.777 --> 16:22.046
Where are you going?
I'm Willie Tanner. Remember?

16:22.048 --> 16:24.782
Well, you guys
all look alike to me.

16:26.920 --> 16:28.920
Nice try, Mr. Fusco.

16:31.624 --> 16:33.891
Well, Trevor, Raquel.

16:33.893 --> 16:36.861
- 'What are you doing here?'
- Uh, uh, Tanner.

16:36.863 --> 16:40.131
Uh, Raquel is thinking
of getting into law enforcement.

16:40.133 --> 16:41.432
Isn't that right, Raquel?

16:41.434 --> 16:44.469
Trevor, they've stripped him
of his shoes.

16:44.471 --> 16:46.571
I told you it could get ugly.

16:46.573 --> 16:49.240
You'd better get used to that
if you wanna wear the badge.

16:49.242 --> 16:51.409
Oh, shut up!

16:51.411 --> 16:54.545
Well, on your way home,
eh, Mr. Tanner?

16:55.749 --> 16:57.749
I know
we're not supposed to say this

16:57.751 --> 17:01.185
but you looked so darned scared.

17:01.187 --> 17:02.954
Sorry, guy.

17:02.956 --> 17:06.524
Well, Mr. Ochmonek, turns out
your boy isn't a polygamist.

17:06.526 --> 17:09.193
He's just a barefoot
social worker.

17:13.967 --> 17:16.300
You turned me in?

17:16.302 --> 17:17.935
Ho-how could you?

17:17.937 --> 17:21.973
You know, come to think of it,
his eyes are kind of slopy.

17:21.975 --> 17:25.043
Yeah, you look exactly
like the guy on TV.

17:25.045 --> 17:28.312
Well, of course. For heaven's
sake, pick up the phone

17:28.314 --> 17:30.148
and have me hauled in.

17:30.150 --> 17:33.451
That's exactly what we did.
What are you whining about?

17:33.453 --> 17:36.120
I can't believe this. After all
these years of being neighbors.

17:36.122 --> 17:39.891
I can't believe you'd sell me
out for a few thousand dollars.

17:39.893 --> 17:41.125
$10,000.

17:42.328 --> 17:46.097
Look, I'm really,
very, very sorry.

17:46.099 --> 17:50.101
But it is nice to know I can
still dredge up a fantasy life.

17:50.103 --> 17:52.737
Thank you.

17:52.739 --> 17:56.541
- Need a ride?
- Are you starting again?

17:56.543 --> 17:59.077
[instrumental music]

17:59.079 --> 18:00.578
No, I can't.

18:00.580 --> 18:04.048
I have to stay home
until my dad gets out of prison.

18:04.050 --> 18:05.750
(Kate)
Brian!

18:05.752 --> 18:07.652
It's something about
marrying lots of women

18:07.654 --> 18:09.420
and taking all their money.

18:09.422 --> 18:11.823
But I'm not allowed
to talk about it. Bye.

18:11.825 --> 18:14.025
[car engine rumbling]

18:16.162 --> 18:18.029
Oh, it's your dad!

18:18.031 --> 18:22.100
But why is he getting out
of the Ochmoneks' car?

18:22.102 --> 18:24.902
- Does he look hardened?
- It's a tough call.

18:24.904 --> 18:26.237
[clattering]

18:26.239 --> 18:29.740
But he did just kick over
one of their lawn flamingos.

18:32.979 --> 18:34.779
- Hi, everybody.
- Dad, you're free!

18:34.781 --> 18:36.914
Oh, honey,
I'm so glad you're home!

18:36.916 --> 18:38.449
(Lynn)
We missed you, dad.

18:38.451 --> 18:41.486
- Was jail horrible?
- Oh, uh..

18:41.488 --> 18:44.222
Would've been nicer with shoes.

18:44.224 --> 18:47.625
All I want now is to sit down
to a nice quiet supper

18:47.627 --> 18:50.194
and put this whole mess
behind me.

18:51.798 --> 18:55.366
Willie! Oh, Willie,
I knew you were innocent!

18:55.368 --> 18:58.936
I'm so excited, I could leave
a spot right here on the carpet!

19:00.573 --> 19:02.673
Honey, I'm gonna
tell you something

19:02.675 --> 19:05.743
that I never thought
I would ever say.

19:05.745 --> 19:09.147
What, you weren't voted
Miss Congeniality, were you?

19:09.149 --> 19:12.550
That would almost be
easier to accept.

19:12.552 --> 19:15.953
Thee fact of the matter is,
ALF here

19:15.955 --> 19:17.855
had nothing to do with this.

19:17.857 --> 19:20.591
It was the Ochmoneks
that turned me in.

19:20.593 --> 19:22.126
Hallelujah!

19:22.128 --> 19:24.896
¶ Oh when the saints come
marching in ¶

19:24.898 --> 19:26.697
¶ Oh, when the saints..
Everybody, come on! ¶¶

19:26.699 --> 19:30.001
ALF, I hate to
interrupt a good gloat

19:30.003 --> 19:31.969
but why didn't you come to me

19:31.971 --> 19:33.971
if you thought
I was in trouble?

19:33.973 --> 19:36.607
'Cause the man on TV said
that if you were the guy

19:36.609 --> 19:39.310
you might take it on the lam.

19:39.312 --> 19:41.512
I didn't wanna lose ya.

19:41.514 --> 19:43.681
You were trying to hide me.

19:43.683 --> 19:47.051
That's what all that stuff
was for, isn't it?

19:47.053 --> 19:51.689
Hey, I figured after all these
years of you protecting me

19:51.691 --> 19:54.091
it was the least
I could do for you.

19:55.228 --> 19:59.664
I have to admit,
that's a very noble gesture.

19:59.666 --> 20:03.601
Done in an all-too-familiar
twisted way.

20:03.603 --> 20:05.236
Thanks.

20:05.238 --> 20:08.206
Honey, why don't you go wash
your feet? We'll have dinner.

20:08.208 --> 20:11.776
Kids, you wanna set the table?
I'll be in in just a second.

20:15.682 --> 20:19.951
Well, ALF, uh, it seems
that I owe you an apology.

20:19.953 --> 20:22.420
I said a lot of things to you
that were unfair

20:22.422 --> 20:26.057
and if I hurt you, I'm sorry.

20:26.059 --> 20:29.126
Why is it I get along with
everybody else in this family

20:29.128 --> 20:31.929
but you and I
never seem to click?

20:31.931 --> 20:34.665
My guess is, it's you.

20:37.370 --> 20:40.504
We're clicking, we're clicking.

20:40.506 --> 20:43.708

[giggling]

20:54.754 --> 20:57.288
What's so funny?

20:57.290 --> 20:58.489
Nothing, honey.

20:58.491 --> 21:00.291
[giggling]

21:00.293 --> 21:02.693
It's that polygamy thing again,
isn't it?

21:02.695 --> 21:05.396
No, honey. It's j-just
something I'm reading.

21:06.666 --> 21:10.067
"Khadhafi
Stockpiling Nerve Gas."

21:10.069 --> 21:13.204
That Muammar, what a prankster!

21:13.206 --> 21:14.538
Okay, okay, I..

21:14.540 --> 21:17.041
Honey, I was just trying to
imagine you with all of those..

21:17.043 --> 21:18.843
[giggles]
All of those women.

21:18.845 --> 21:20.811
I mean, no,
not that it couldn't happen.

21:20.813 --> 21:24.282
I still find you
totally irresistible.

21:24.284 --> 21:25.650
Really.

21:25.652 --> 21:27.785
- Apology accepted.
- Okay.

21:27.787 --> 21:29.654
Let's drop it.

21:29.656 --> 21:31.289
No, keep going, Kate!

21:31.291 --> 21:35.559
Come on, we've both seen him
in the shower.

21:35.561 --> 21:39.797
We're dropping this conversation
right now, thank you.

21:43.936 --> 21:46.304
Well, if you need me,
I'll be down on the corner

21:46.306 --> 21:49.407
listening to rap music
with the bros.

21:49.409 --> 21:52.810
Wait, wait, wait.
Where do you think you're going?

21:52.812 --> 21:55.279
Say what?

21:55.281 --> 21:58.082
That's not much
of a disguise, you know?

21:58.084 --> 22:00.818
You're right,
if I had a little black bow

22:00.820 --> 22:03.487
I could go as Rose Marie.

22:03.489 --> 22:05.356
[chuckling]

22:14.367 --> 22:17.368
[theme music]

22:37.390 --> 22:40.391

22:42.895 --> 22:44.962
