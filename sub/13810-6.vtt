06:46.405 --> 06:48.324
FROM LIVING HIS LIFE
TO THE FULLEST.

21:16.566 --> 21:17.609
I'M REALLY SORRY.

21:17.693 --> 21:18.360
HEY, MAYBE
TITO KNOWS

21:18.443 --> 21:19.987
WHERE WE CAN
FIND ANOTHER ONE

21:20.070 --> 21:22.739
BEFORE YOUR RACE
BEGINS, REG.

21:22.823 --> 21:24.658

21:33.041 --> 21:34.543
{\an1}YOU NEED A NEW
TUNICHELLA SHELL?

21:34.626 --> 21:39.381
{\an4}THERE'S A STAND
RIGHT OVER THERE
THAT SHELLS THEM.

PEOPLE CAN BUY
LUCKY SHELLS?

21:41.967 --> 21:42.884

{\an1}DON'T YOU REMEMBER
THAT STORY I TOLD YOU

21:44.553 --> 21:47.472
ABOUT THE ANCIENT HAWAIIAN
IN THE STORM?

21:47.556 --> 21:49.224
YEAH, THAT SHELL
GAVE HIM

21:49.307 --> 21:50.976
THE STRENGTH
TO PADDLE IN.

21:51.059 --> 21:53.311
NO, THE SHELL ONLY HELPED HIM

21:53.395 --> 21:55.272
{\an1}TO FIND THE STRENGTH
WITHIN HIMSELF.

21:55.355 --> 21:58.900
{\an1}SOME PEOPLE BELIEVE
THAT'S WHAT LUCK REALLY IS.

21:58.984 --> 22:00.235
THINK FOR A SECOND.

22:00.318 --> 22:03.572
WHAT DID YOU DO WHEN YOU THOUGHT
THE SHELL HAD LUCKY POWER?

22:03.655 --> 22:05.407
I GRABBED IT AND
I CLOSED MY EYES

22:05.490 --> 22:06.950
AND TRIED
TO FEEL THE FORCE.

22:07.034 --> 22:08.035
THAT'S WHAT I DID.

22:08.118 --> 22:09.411
HEY... ME, TOO.

22:09.494 --> 22:12.414
WE WERE ALL CONCENTRATING
ON WHAT WE WANTED TO DO.

STILL DOESN'T EXPLAIN ME.

22:16.293 --> 22:17.502
YOU STUDIED HARD, LITTLE CUZ.

22:17.586 --> 22:20.756
I GUESS WE MADE OUR OWN
GOOD LUCK HAPPEN, HUH?

22:20.839 --> 22:22.966
WELL, REG, YOU BETTER
START MAKING IT AGAIN

22:23.050 --> 22:24.009
BECAUSE YOU'RE UP.

22:24.092 --> 22:24.968
GOT TO GO.

22:25.052 --> 22:25.969

22:42.235 --> 22:44.613
IT WAS YOUR SHELL
TO BEGIN WITH, SQUID.

22:44.696 --> 22:46.448
SORRY WE KIND
OF TOOK OVER.

22:46.531 --> 22:47.824
THAT'S COOL, DUDE.

22:47.908 --> 22:50.577
