09:50.423 --> 09:52.425
you need to work it out.

09:52.425 --> 09:55.428
Now we have been working
for this Saturday all year.

09:55.428 --> 09:57.388
And I don't know what
you've been doing all week.

09:57.430 --> 10:00.183
Are you with this team?
Yes, ma'am.

10:00.225 --> 10:03.520
You're sure.
Yes, ma'am.

10:04.771 --> 10:07.732
All right, then.
Let's do it again.

10:12.112 --> 10:14.739
(Mrs. Dunn)
Hey, Jason!

10:14.781 --> 10:16.449
How are you?

10:16.449 --> 10:19.285
(Jason)
I'm fine.

10:19.285 --> 10:21.412
I missed you guys.

10:21.454 --> 10:22.330
Hey.

10:22.330 --> 10:25.250
Look, he's back.
I told you he would be.

10:25.291 --> 10:26.793
Hey, squirt.

10:26.793 --> 10:28.211
Been watching
the Cowboys this year?

10:28.253 --> 10:30.380
Yeah.

10:30.421 --> 10:32.132
Can you walk?

10:32.132 --> 10:33.716
Jake, that's not
very nice.

10:33.758 --> 10:36.219
Sorry.
It's okay.
It's all right.

10:36.261 --> 10:39.597
No, buddy, I can't yet.

10:39.639 --> 10:41.599
But, uh...

10:41.641 --> 10:43.601
I bet I could
beat you in a race.

10:48.273 --> 10:49.607
Come on, buddy.

10:58.658 --> 11:00.493
[laughter]

11:00.493 --> 11:02.579
All right,
you got me that time.

11:02.620 --> 11:03.830
Want to do it again?

11:03.830 --> 11:05.498
I probably shouldn't, buddy.

11:05.540 --> 11:07.792
I don't sweat like
normal people anymore.

11:07.834 --> 11:09.502
Come on, it's time
for your snacks anyway.

11:09.502 --> 11:11.337
You guys can play
later, all right?

11:11.337 --> 11:13.423
All right.
See you later, Jason.

11:13.464 --> 11:15.508
Hey, Jake, don't play
in the street, all right?

11:15.508 --> 11:18.511
That's a one‐time thing.
All right, bye.

11:18.511 --> 11:20.597
Whew.

11:41.367 --> 11:42.827
Hey.

11:42.869 --> 11:44.454
Hi.

11:46.915 --> 11:48.708
I have nothing
to say to you.

11:52.545 --> 11:53.913
Don't come back here.

12:03.890 --> 12:05.516
(Levine)
Note Homer's double standard
in how Ulysses

12:05.558 --> 12:07.727
is treated
with extreme forgiveness

12:07.727 --> 12:10.688
for his dalliance
with Circe in the Odyssey.

12:10.730 --> 12:12.565
Yeah, well,
Ulysses was a pimp.

12:12.565 --> 12:14.192
[laughter]

12:14.234 --> 12:15.652
Look, I'm just saying.

12:15.693 --> 12:17.487
It's all about
the seed and the egg.

12:17.528 --> 12:18.571
You know, the flower
and the bee.

12:18.571 --> 12:20.740
A man's job is to
spread the pollen

12:20.740 --> 12:22.659
and the woman's
job is to grow it.

12:22.700 --> 12:25.578
But you can only grow
one seed at a time, right?

12:25.578 --> 12:27.747
I‐‐I don't follow
you exactly.

12:27.789 --> 12:29.290
What I was trying‐‐

12:29.290 --> 12:31.709
I think what he's trying
to say is that

12:31.751 --> 12:33.253
monogamy isn't natural.

12:33.253 --> 12:36.756
The male species is hardwired
for genetic diversity.

12:36.756 --> 12:39.759
So the instinct is to,
you know,

12:39.759 --> 12:42.595
fertilize as many eggs
as possible, to have sex.

12:42.595 --> 12:44.597
Exactly.

12:44.597 --> 12:45.932
[laughter]

12:45.932 --> 12:47.517
Yeah, but human beings
are different.

12:47.558 --> 12:49.269
I mean,
civilization is based

12:49.269 --> 12:50.770
on the repression
of instincts.

12:50.770 --> 12:52.897
When we act contrary
to our instincts,

12:52.939 --> 12:54.941
that's when things
get interesting.

12:54.941 --> 12:57.610
A lot of people would
say that monogamy

12:57.610 --> 12:59.779
is a state of
higher evolution.

12:59.779 --> 13:03.199
With the right person.

13:09.956 --> 13:11.749
What's up, baby?
Listen.

13:13.793 --> 13:16.629
I'm having a party.
You should come.

13:16.629 --> 13:18.631
We should kick it
like a football, baby.

13:18.631 --> 13:19.966
We're gonna have a little pool
party, a little suds

13:19.966 --> 13:21.259
and buds, if you know
what I'm talking about.

13:21.301 --> 13:22.885
No.

13:22.927 --> 13:24.762
Everybody's cool
with your little trip.

13:24.804 --> 13:26.306
If that's what
you're into.

13:26.306 --> 13:27.807
But I'm not gonna
judge it.

13:27.807 --> 13:28.975
I love it‐‐
What's up?

13:28.975 --> 13:32.312
What's up?

13:32.312 --> 13:35.273
What's up, Riggs?

13:35.315 --> 13:38.401
I was just leaving.

13:42.613 --> 13:43.906
Man.

13:48.953 --> 13:50.621
What are you doing?

13:50.663 --> 13:53.791
Don't you know you're sitting
with the school slut?

13:53.833 --> 13:58.629
Let 'em look, Lyla.
I don't care.

14:05.803 --> 14:07.847
It's different
for girls.

14:07.847 --> 14:09.807
You can sleep around
all you want

14:09.849 --> 14:11.601
and people think
you're cool.

14:11.642 --> 14:13.853
I make one mistake‐‐

14:13.853 --> 14:17.523
And it was a mistake.

14:21.527 --> 14:23.696
Tim, you're
making it worse.

14:23.696 --> 14:24.989
You can't be here.

14:34.874 --> 14:36.501
What the hell was that?

14:36.542 --> 14:37.710
What are you
talking about?

14:37.710 --> 14:39.295
Sitting with Lyla
in the cafeteria.

14:39.337 --> 14:41.881
Don't you know you're just
making this worse for her?

14:41.881 --> 14:43.549
Yeah, she kind of
just mentioned that.

14:43.549 --> 14:44.884
Why don't you stay away
from her, then?

14:44.884 --> 14:46.803
Stay out of it.

14:50.723 --> 14:52.850
You're in love with her.

14:56.896 --> 14:58.314
Yeah.

15:05.905 --> 15:07.031
(Buddy)
What do you got?

15:07.073 --> 15:08.574
Oh, good, good, good.

15:08.574 --> 15:11.577
That's what I thought,
that you had that one.

15:11.577 --> 15:13.746
Sweet.
Good job, sir.

15:13.746 --> 15:15.414
Good day.
Is that 12?

15:15.456 --> 15:16.624
It was 12.

15:16.624 --> 15:18.751
Oh, yeah, that's
what we like to hear.

15:18.751 --> 15:20.753
Hello, Ben.
Ben Beck.

15:20.753 --> 15:21.921
Long time no see.

15:21.921 --> 15:23.923
Now I will warn you,
I am hot.

15:23.923 --> 15:25.925
You walk in here tonight,
you may drive out

15:25.925 --> 15:29.095
in a new truck,
I'm not kidding you.

15:29.095 --> 15:31.347
Are you all right,
partner?

15:31.389 --> 15:32.598
You look like you
just seen a ghost.

15:32.598 --> 15:33.724
I want you to know.

15:33.766 --> 15:37.395
Brittany put some stuff
on the internet about Lyla.

15:37.436 --> 15:39.564
Other kids added to it,

15:39.605 --> 15:42.733
but I'm pretty sure Brittany's
the one who started it.

15:42.775 --> 15:43.943
Stuff on the internet.

15:43.943 --> 15:47.613
What‐‐what are you
talking about, Ben?

15:47.613 --> 15:51.617
It's bad.
I'm not gonna lie to you.

15:51.617 --> 15:53.619
Alice is home
with her right now

15:53.619 --> 15:56.956
trying to figure out what
in God's name possessed her.

15:56.998 --> 15:59.667
I felt like I owed you
an apology in person.

15:59.667 --> 16:02.920
Lyla doesn't deserve this.

16:02.962 --> 16:04.964
No matter what she did.

16:04.964 --> 16:06.966
(Tami)
It was medieval.

16:06.966 --> 16:08.050
You know, it was like
The Scarlet Letter

16:08.092 --> 16:09.468
or something
watching that girl

16:09.468 --> 16:11.929
walk across the cafeteria

16:11.971 --> 16:14.390
and everybody
just glared at her.

16:14.432 --> 16:15.641
That's high school.

16:15.641 --> 16:17.476
At least they didn't
burn her at the goal post.

16:17.476 --> 16:19.562
[doorbell rings]
I'm telling you‐‐

16:19.604 --> 16:21.063
Go see who that is,
please.

16:24.984 --> 16:26.569
Uh, hey, sir.

16:28.154 --> 16:29.488
Ma'am.

16:29.488 --> 16:32.992
I was just wondering‐‐

16:32.992 --> 16:35.661
Sorry, I was just
wondering if‐‐

16:35.661 --> 16:36.996
Is Julie here?

16:37.038 --> 16:39.040
Hey, Matt.
Hi, Dad.

16:39.040 --> 16:42.501
Me and Matt are gonna
go watch some TV.

16:42.501 --> 16:45.129
If that's okay.

16:45.171 --> 16:46.672
(Julie)
Hey, Mom.

16:46.672 --> 16:47.840
We're gonna watch
some TV.

16:47.840 --> 16:49.175
(Matt)
Hi, Mrs. Coach.

16:49.175 --> 16:51.969
All right,
um, well‐‐

16:53.512 --> 16:54.931
What about
tackling drills?

16:54.972 --> 16:56.515
Y'all do a lot of those?

16:56.515 --> 16:57.975
Yes, sir, every day,
every single day.

16:58.017 --> 17:01.020
Coach used to always yell
at practice that, uh,

17:01.020 --> 17:03.606
"Good defense wins
football games."

17:03.648 --> 17:05.691
I mean you personally.

17:05.691 --> 17:07.026
Me personally?

17:07.026 --> 17:08.819
Yeah, mm‐hmm.
Tackling drills?

17:08.861 --> 17:11.906
Heh.

17:13.032 --> 17:15.451
I was the quarterback.

17:15.493 --> 17:17.536
Yeah, I realize that.

17:17.536 --> 17:19.914
But I was just wondering
if at any time

17:19.914 --> 17:22.041
during a practice
or a scrimmage

17:22.083 --> 17:23.626
or really any time at all

17:23.668 --> 17:25.002
before you got hurt
in that game,

17:25.044 --> 17:28.130
did Coach Taylor ever
personally instruct you,

17:28.172 --> 17:30.883
Jason Street,
on how to make a tackle?

17:30.883 --> 17:31.968
He didn't have to.

17:32.009 --> 17:34.011
Okay.

17:34.053 --> 17:37.181
Because I played quarterback.

17:37.223 --> 17:39.058
Okay, so that's a no.

17:39.058 --> 17:41.102
I guess so, I‐‐

17:45.064 --> 17:47.733
Are you trying to say this
is Coach Taylor's fault?

17:47.733 --> 17:50.069
No, no, I'm just trying
to find out what happened.

17:50.069 --> 17:51.821
'Cause I threw
the interception.

17:51.862 --> 17:53.155
And I got pissed off and I
went and tackled somebody.

17:53.197 --> 17:55.241
That was‐‐
that's how it happened.

17:55.241 --> 17:57.076
I know, I know, but when
you tackled him

17:57.076 --> 17:59.495
you had your head down
because no one

17:59.537 --> 18:00.913
had ever taught you
any other way‐‐

18:00.913 --> 18:01.872
I cannot believe this‐‐
you said if we were gonna

18:01.914 --> 18:03.583
sue anybody, it was gonna be
the school, Dad.

18:03.624 --> 18:05.001
We said nothing
about Coach Taylor.

18:05.042 --> 18:06.919
Jason, take it easy.

18:06.919 --> 18:08.546
This was not
Coach Taylor's fault.

18:08.588 --> 18:10.089
Coach Taylor did not
make that tackle, I did.

18:10.089 --> 18:11.757
I know, and‐‐

18:11.757 --> 18:15.094
Sir...sir...y'all‐‐
y'all can try and get me to say

18:15.094 --> 18:16.679
whatever you want me to say,

18:16.721 --> 18:19.098
but I'm not gonna say
that it was Coach's fault.

18:19.098 --> 18:21.017
All I want you to do
is tell the truth.

18:21.058 --> 18:24.854
And that's what
you've done, right?

18:26.272 --> 18:28.274
Heh.

18:28.274 --> 18:30.067
Honey, will you stop
pacing, please?

18:30.109 --> 18:31.569
What do you suppose
they're doing in there?

18:31.611 --> 18:33.195
Probably having sex.

18:33.237 --> 18:34.947
[giggles]

18:34.947 --> 18:35.865
That's not funny.

18:35.906 --> 18:36.782
Well, it's a little
bit funny.

18:36.782 --> 18:39.076
That's not funny.
Sit down and play cards.

18:39.118 --> 18:40.745
I don't like the fact
that he just shows up here.

18:40.786 --> 18:42.121
That's not right.

18:42.163 --> 18:43.831
Well, I don't necessarily
like it much either.

18:43.831 --> 18:44.999
Where are you going?
I'm gonna go out there.

18:44.999 --> 18:46.167
Come back here
right now.

18:46.208 --> 18:48.127
I'll be back in a second,
I'ma get something to drink‐‐

18:48.127 --> 18:49.128
Don't go out there.
Don't‐‐

18:49.128 --> 18:50.963
You‐‐you warm enough?

18:50.963 --> 18:52.089
Yeah, I'm good.

18:52.131 --> 18:54.634
All right.

18:54.634 --> 18:56.552
Hey, how we doing
out here?

18:56.594 --> 18:58.137
Uh, good.

18:58.137 --> 19:00.765
We're just watching TV.

19:00.806 --> 19:01.641
What's with the blanket?

19:01.641 --> 19:02.808
Who told you you could
get a blanket out?

19:02.808 --> 19:04.143
It's cold in here.

19:04.143 --> 19:05.603
That's 'cause I like
to keep the AC low.

19:05.645 --> 19:06.896
Yeah, hence the blanket.

19:06.937 --> 19:08.314
How much longer till
the program's over, honey?

19:08.314 --> 19:09.732
Dad.

19:09.774 --> 19:11.067
It's a school night,
honey.

19:11.108 --> 19:13.611
It's 9:00, Dad.

19:13.653 --> 19:14.654
Yeah, but I probably...

19:14.695 --> 19:16.739
I should probably get going
home anyway though.

19:16.781 --> 19:17.948
No, no, no, you really
don't have to.

19:17.990 --> 19:21.160
No, no, no, I don't like to
leave my grandma home at night.

19:21.160 --> 19:23.245
So it's probably better‐‐

19:23.287 --> 19:26.040
Will you just tell‐‐

19:26.040 --> 19:27.208
Good night,
Mrs. Taylor.

19:27.208 --> 19:28.167
(Tami)
Oh, good night, Matt.

19:28.167 --> 19:29.168
Um...

19:29.168 --> 19:32.129
[clears throat]

19:32.171 --> 19:33.130
I'll see you tomorrow.

19:33.172 --> 19:35.132
Good night, Coach.

19:35.174 --> 19:36.300
Bye, Matt.

19:36.342 --> 19:37.677
I'll see you tomorrow.

19:37.677 --> 19:38.969
Bye, Matt.

19:43.182 --> 19:44.183
[front door closes]

19:44.183 --> 19:47.103
Thanks.

19:47.144 --> 19:48.813
(Tami)
Sorry, babe.

19:52.191 --> 19:53.818
They had a blanket.

31:25.383 --> 31:26.635
and this team's
got a damn good chance

31:26.676 --> 31:27.552
of making the playoffs.

31:27.552 --> 31:29.554
So I'm sure
you'll prioritize.

31:29.554 --> 31:32.474
Yes, sir.

31:34.684 --> 31:36.561
We're gonna
go get 'em tonight.

31:36.561 --> 31:37.896
I told you, I'm not going
all the way over there

31:37.896 --> 31:39.314
for some stupid
football game.

31:39.356 --> 31:40.315
Then how about after?

31:40.357 --> 31:41.399
I'll pick you up
at your house.

31:41.399 --> 31:42.150
Hey, Smash.

31:42.192 --> 31:44.528
Hey.
Have a great game
tonight.

31:44.569 --> 31:45.570
I will.

31:45.570 --> 31:47.572
And we will be watching.

31:47.572 --> 31:49.574
Don't‐‐don't even
worry about them.

31:49.574 --> 31:50.659
Don't even worry
about them.

31:50.700 --> 31:52.744
Okay, look,
we had dinner,

31:52.744 --> 31:54.037
and you asked me
all your questions.

31:54.079 --> 31:55.705
And blah, blah, blah.
We caught up.

31:55.747 --> 31:57.374
So just go
score some goals.

31:57.415 --> 31:58.583
You know I ain't gonna
give up that easy.

31:58.625 --> 32:00.710
Smash don't take no
for an answer.

32:00.752 --> 32:02.003
Yeah, but he loves
to refer to himself

32:02.045 --> 32:03.338
in the third person.

32:03.380 --> 32:04.422
Which, by the way,

32:04.422 --> 32:05.423
is incredibly annoying.

32:05.423 --> 32:07.092
Right now, Smash!
Coach is pissed!

32:07.092 --> 32:09.010
Bus is leaving.
I'll be right there, sir!

32:09.052 --> 32:10.011
Hurry up!
I'm comin'!

32:23.608 --> 32:25.777
(TV announcer)
Well, the game's over,
and the Dillon Panthers

32:25.777 --> 32:28.405
put a world of hurt on the
winless Timberwolves tonight.

32:28.446 --> 32:31.032
First quarter, Matt Saracen
gives to Smash Williams

32:31.074 --> 32:33.577
for an easy score
and an early seven‐point lead.

32:33.618 --> 32:34.619
Fix it.

32:34.619 --> 32:35.620
And that was the story tonight

32:35.620 --> 32:36.580
as young Mr. Williams

32:36.621 --> 32:39.082
lit the Timberwolves
defense up

32:39.124 --> 32:40.667
for 166 yards rushing,

32:40.667 --> 32:41.751
Good game.
seven receptions,

32:41.793 --> 32:43.461
and three, count 'em,
three touchdowns.

Yeah?

32:55.473 --> 32:56.808
Okay, your part's starting.

32:56.808 --> 32:58.977
What did I tell you?
Huh?

32:58.977 --> 33:01.479
If you move those feet‐‐
look at that.

33:01.479 --> 33:02.606
Well, whenever
this is done,

33:02.647 --> 33:04.608
I gotta watch
these game tapes, okay?

33:21.208 --> 33:22.209
Mmm...

33:22.209 --> 33:24.502
Oh!
Oh, that's‐‐

33:24.502 --> 33:25.378
I got my eyes set
on UT now.

33:25.420 --> 33:27.005
Oh, yeah?
That's a really good school.

33:27.005 --> 33:28.006

you have a chance?

33:28.006 --> 33:28.965

Long as I stay healthy
and get my touches.

33:32.010 --> 33:34.596
Well, no,

to get in there now,

33:36.514 --> 33:37.515
even if you are in‐state.

33:37.515 --> 33:40.769
Yeah, well, I'm working
on my studies and stuff.

33:40.810 --> 33:42.687

by doing your homework.

33:47.025 --> 33:48.818

about med school?

anything, do you?

33:51.863 --> 33:52.864
Steel trap, baby.

33:52.864 --> 33:54.532
Steel trap.

33:54.532 --> 33:56.534
I still remember
when we first moved here.

33:56.534 --> 33:58.119
Ooh, yes.

33:58.161 --> 33:59.663
It'd be you, Sheila,

33:59.704 --> 34:02.165
and Missy in the back
of the choir room

34:02.207 --> 34:03.166
playing doctor.

34:03.208 --> 34:04.793
You never
let me play, though.

34:04.834 --> 34:07.003
Well, that's because you
always wanted to play dirty,

34:07.045 --> 34:09.130
and we were running
a nice, clean hospital.

34:09.172 --> 34:10.715
It ain't my fault you always
needed an operation, baby.

34:10.715 --> 34:11.675
I was just trying
to help you out.

34:11.716 --> 34:14.844
Whatever.

34:14.886 --> 34:17.514
I don't know.
People change, and...

34:17.555 --> 34:19.683
that may not be the best thing
for me right now.

34:19.724 --> 34:22.227
Although I know it would
make Daddy happy.

34:22.227 --> 34:23.895
Yeah, well,
your dad is the man.

34:23.895 --> 34:26.731
I mean, letting you go
to Africa and all.

34:26.731 --> 34:29.734

who do something like that

34:31.695 --> 34:33.571

with their roots they are.

to talk about it.

all the way to state.

34:46.084 --> 34:48.086

34:48.086 --> 34:50.505
Make sure to bring
a swimsuit too.

34:50.547 --> 34:51.506

34:51.548 --> 34:53.091

excited about it.

a little embarrassing.

you spent that money

35:07.606 --> 35:10.775

you didn't go to Africa.

35:24.164 --> 35:24.998
Please say something.

35:24.998 --> 35:26.791
What do you want me
to say, Lyla?

35:26.833 --> 35:27.584
That everything's fine?

35:27.626 --> 35:30.754
'Cause I'm sorry,
I can't do it.

as well as you do.

I'm so sorry.

35:37.302 --> 35:39.888

cheating on me.

gotta tell me, huh?

for sticking by me?

36:06.206 --> 36:08.792
I did not ask for this.

36:08.833 --> 36:11.002
And I damn sure
did not ask

36:11.002 --> 36:13.922
for the one person
in this world that I loved

36:13.963 --> 36:16.716
to break my friggin' heart.

36:19.344 --> 36:21.763
I didn't ask for this
either, Jason.

36:23.682 --> 36:27.143

broke my heart.

36:27.185 --> 36:31.356

forgive me for that,

that you are all that I have

we gotta do, though,

a ride with Matt?

at his house

Yeah, well,
I didn't know that‐‐

38:21.800 --> 38:23.802

the Matt chat

didn't go as well
as you expected.

an amazing cheerleader,

that same feeling
