WEBVTT

00:03.885 --> 00:06.991
(soft airy music)

00:16.175 --> 00:20.117
(soft airy music continues)

00:22.989 --> 00:25.995
(birds chirping)

00:33.611 --> 00:35.380
- April 29th, 2012.

00:37.284 --> 00:40.123
That was my first Sunday
at Hillsong Church.

00:40.123 --> 00:43.463
(congregation screams)

00:45.133 --> 00:48.808
I have the date
tattooed on me. (laughs)

00:50.678 --> 00:53.149
- [Reporter] 7,000
people line up to attend

00:53.149 --> 00:55.788
one of seven services
offered each Sunday.

00:57.124 --> 00:58.426
- [Reporter] A church
frequented by celebrities

00:58.426 --> 00:59.897
like Justin and Hailey Bieber.

00:59.897 --> 01:01.266
- [Reporter] Basketball stars.

01:01.266 --> 01:02.736
- [Commentator] Chandler,
they need to go!

01:02.736 --> 01:06.075
- [Reporter] Selena Gomez,
and Kendall and Kylie Jenner.

01:06.075 --> 01:07.746
- [Tiff] When I found
Hillsong Church,

01:07.746 --> 01:12.288
it felt like I
belonged somewhere.

01:14.793 --> 01:17.766
It's not just church
like it's an experience.

01:17.766 --> 01:20.638
(congregation cheers)

01:20.638 --> 01:21.907
- [Person] Hillsong
is a megachurch.

01:21.907 --> 01:24.445
150,000 people go
there every week.

01:24.445 --> 01:26.249
- It's very, very dark.

01:26.249 --> 01:28.186
There's no windows, no
stained glass windows,

01:28.186 --> 01:29.589
no piano, no organ.

01:29.589 --> 01:31.961
- There's like young
people. Everyone looks hip.

01:31.961 --> 01:34.265
- [Josh] Big band on stage.

01:34.265 --> 01:35.602
- Everyone's clapping.

01:35.602 --> 01:38.273
"Who's excited to
be at church today?"

01:38.273 --> 01:41.145
- It was just... I felt magical.

01:41.145 --> 01:45.521
(crowd screams)
(firecrackers exploding)

01:45.521 --> 01:47.324
- And then Carl
comes out on stage.

01:49.095 --> 01:51.132
His messages were...

01:51.132 --> 01:53.203
I mean, they were kind of
really beautifully crafted.

01:53.203 --> 01:55.207
- I love you. It's good
to see you in church.

01:55.207 --> 01:56.844
Just so you know, you're
dealing with depression.

01:56.844 --> 01:58.814
So I want you to call me.

01:58.814 --> 02:00.885
I want you to call
me if you need me,

02:00.885 --> 02:02.454
'cause I'm not gonna
leave you high and dry.

02:02.454 --> 02:05.595
Till the day we get it
right, I'm with you.

02:05.595 --> 02:06.664
I got your back.

02:06.664 --> 02:08.968
- [Person] He repeatedly
hits these crescendos.

02:08.968 --> 02:10.070
- I want some new problems.

02:10.070 --> 02:12.107
- "I want new problems."

02:13.276 --> 02:15.347
And it is true that
there were problems.

02:16.416 --> 02:17.619
But they weren't the ones

02:17.619 --> 02:18.788
that he was talking
about on stage.

02:18.788 --> 02:20.758
(tense music)

02:20.758 --> 02:21.794
- [Speaker] Carl Lentz.

02:21.794 --> 02:23.096
- [Speaker] Carl Lentz.

02:23.096 --> 02:24.633
- [Speaker] Carl Lentz, the,
quote, "celebrity pastor,"

02:24.633 --> 02:27.304
whose recent downfall has
triggered a wave of scandals

02:27.304 --> 02:28.641
for the church-

02:28.641 --> 02:30.210
- [Reporter] He was fired
from the wildly popular

02:30.210 --> 02:31.814
Hillsong church for what
the church described

02:31.814 --> 02:33.517
as "moral failures."

02:33.517 --> 02:35.220
- As the story unraveled,
it made us question

02:35.220 --> 02:38.026
why Carl was fired in
such a spectacular way.

02:38.026 --> 02:40.097
- It's like Watergate.
The coverup was
worse than the crime.

02:40.097 --> 02:41.734
- [Reporter] Spiritual
advisor to Justin Bieber.

02:41.734 --> 02:43.604
- [Speaker] This man's a
fool. He's a charlatan.

02:43.604 --> 02:44.773
It's pitiful.

02:44.773 --> 02:46.175
- [Reporter] All
came crashing down

02:46.175 --> 02:47.545
when Lentz admitted
to an affair.

02:47.545 --> 02:50.083
- He went from golden boy to
shit string in like 33 seconds.

02:50.083 --> 02:52.655
- [Reporter] Carl Lentz is
working on damage control.

02:52.655 --> 02:54.826
- I think if a story was
just about Carl cheating,

02:54.826 --> 02:56.497
we probably wouldn't
be sitting here today.

02:56.497 --> 02:58.233
- [Reporter] The firing
of Lentz in New York

02:58.233 --> 03:00.070
opened the floodgates
for Hillsong.

03:00.070 --> 03:01.774
- [Alex] Carl was problematic,

03:01.774 --> 03:04.913
but there were like larger
forces at work here.

03:04.913 --> 03:06.349
This was a cultural problem.

03:06.349 --> 03:07.151
- [Court Official]
The whole truth.

03:07.151 --> 03:08.386
- The whole truth.

03:08.386 --> 03:09.321
- [Court Official] And
nothing but the truth.'

03:09.321 --> 03:10.958
- And nothing but the truth.

03:10.958 --> 03:13.163
- [Speaker] The
most un-Christian
behavior imaginable.

03:13.163 --> 03:18.306
- It's child abuse, it's labor
abuse, it's sexual assault.

03:18.306 --> 03:19.308
- [Speaker] We certainly
knew that they were

03:19.308 --> 03:21.747
the very serious allegations.

03:21.747 --> 03:23.383
- [Speaker] There was
more than one victim.

03:23.383 --> 03:25.788
They knew this was going
to be a PR disaster.

03:25.788 --> 03:26.990
- [Speaker] Mean, this is a
church we're talking about.

03:26.990 --> 03:29.529
- [Speaker] And then
Carl just disappeared.

03:29.529 --> 03:31.900
- [Reporter] We reached out
and have no comment from Carl

03:31.900 --> 03:33.571
and Hillsong Church.

03:33.571 --> 03:35.908
- [Alex] But I
mean Carl's flock,

03:35.908 --> 03:36.944
the people in his church

03:36.944 --> 03:40.117
who really depended on
him, they felt deserted.

03:40.117 --> 03:41.252
They were adrift.

03:43.123 --> 03:45.962
(light funky music)

03:49.603 --> 03:54.245
♪ I hope you find
some peace of mind ♪

03:54.245 --> 03:58.954
♪ In this lifetime ♪

04:01.259 --> 04:05.333
♪ I hope you find
some paradise ♪

04:10.678 --> 04:14.586
(light funky music continues)

04:23.203 --> 04:27.311
(light funky music continues)

04:35.160 --> 04:39.301
(sirens wailing)
(birds chirping)

04:39.301 --> 04:43.376
- [Carl] Well, I'm sick of
seeing people who are amazing

04:44.178 --> 04:45.347
wreck their lives over something

04:45.347 --> 04:46.783
that could have been stopped.

04:46.783 --> 04:49.288
That's why you have to do
everything in your life tonight.

04:50.457 --> 04:52.194
- I've been a journalist,

04:52.194 --> 04:54.566
primarily an investigative
journalist for about 15 years.

04:54.566 --> 04:57.404
- [Carl] Protect your
identity. Protect your sexual-

04:57.404 --> 04:59.810
- I love it when
you work on a story

04:59.810 --> 05:02.816
and the story that
you're assigned first

05:02.816 --> 05:05.420
isn't actually the one
that you end up following.

05:05.420 --> 05:08.259
- [Carl] Tonight, you
are here, because God-

05:08.259 --> 05:11.399
- [Alex] And I think that that's
what happened to Dan and I.

05:12.902 --> 05:16.409
- I started reporting
on Hillsong when
Carl Lentz got fired.

05:18.581 --> 05:21.052
My editor, Matt Lynch
texted me one night saying,

05:21.052 --> 05:24.091
"We should take a closer
look at all of this."

05:24.091 --> 05:26.362
At first, it was a
celebrity scandal,

05:28.066 --> 05:30.571
and then quickly
it became a scandal

05:30.571 --> 05:32.609
having to do with
the church itself.

05:32.609 --> 05:34.245
- I've never seen
anything like this.

05:34.245 --> 05:37.084
I mean it's just this thing
that is splitting apart,

05:37.084 --> 05:38.152
and it's crazy to me

05:38.152 --> 05:41.459
that the sort of the
first shoe was Carl.

05:48.339 --> 05:50.778
- I was raised
traditional Catholic.

05:50.778 --> 05:55.186
It was just a lot of Hail Marys
and a lot of Our Father's.

05:55.186 --> 05:58.092
I always felt like it
was my family's faith

05:58.092 --> 06:00.096
and it always just
passed along to me.

06:01.500 --> 06:03.704
But when I found
Hillsong Church,

06:04.673 --> 06:06.209
I'm looking around this place

06:06.209 --> 06:10.518
and there's people that look
like me and that are my age.

06:11.954 --> 06:14.458
(soft music)

06:16.028 --> 06:18.066
(congregation whistling)

06:18.066 --> 06:20.504
And then Carl Lentz walks
on stage and I'm like,

06:20.504 --> 06:22.140
"Who is this?

06:22.140 --> 06:24.078
This cannot be the pastor."

06:24.078 --> 06:27.150
(congregation applauds)

06:29.956 --> 06:32.495
- Remember, we didn't know
when we moved into this condo

06:32.495 --> 06:36.670
that to the left of our condo
was one drug dealing community

06:36.670 --> 06:39.408
and to the right was another
drug dealing community.

06:39.408 --> 06:41.445
Found out one day, because
as I was sitting there

06:41.445 --> 06:43.116
at about two o'clock
on a Saturday

06:43.116 --> 06:44.853
playing "Call of
Duty" as a grown man,

06:44.853 --> 06:46.188
which is always God's will,

06:46.188 --> 06:47.725
(congregation laughs)

06:47.725 --> 06:51.399
with my baby girl Ava who's
asleep at the time upstairs

06:51.399 --> 06:53.369
and I heard a loud pop,

06:53.369 --> 06:56.743
15, 16, 17 pops,
unmistakable gunfire.

06:56.743 --> 06:58.514
And we did what
all strong men do,

06:58.514 --> 07:00.718
immediately screamed
and hid under the couch.

07:00.718 --> 07:02.354
(congregation laughs)

07:02.354 --> 07:04.224
And there was a moment where
there's about four detectives

07:04.224 --> 07:06.429
looking at our house and
they're sitting there

07:06.429 --> 07:07.532
and I came over, I said, "Sir,

07:07.532 --> 07:09.034
what are you guys looking at?"

07:09.034 --> 07:11.439
And they're like, "We
just can't believe

07:11.439 --> 07:13.476
that there is not
one bullet hole

07:13.476 --> 07:14.946
in the second floor
of your house.

07:14.946 --> 07:16.950
'Cause from where he
was shooting from,

07:16.950 --> 07:18.219
you should have not
just one or two,

07:18.219 --> 07:20.357
but you should have all
kinds of bullet holes.

07:20.357 --> 07:21.627
Is there anybody up there?"

07:21.627 --> 07:23.864
I'm like, "Yeah, my
daughter's up there.

07:23.864 --> 07:25.133
My daughter, she's
sleeping up there."

07:25.133 --> 07:27.371
And I just thought,
man, this is crazy.

07:27.371 --> 07:30.143
And then my old neighbor,
about 70-some-years-old,

07:30.143 --> 07:32.180
comes out in just a tank
top and some underwear

07:32.180 --> 07:34.251
and some crocs, he's like, "Oh
you know, that's a Christian.

07:34.251 --> 07:36.389
He a man of God. Ain't nothing
ever gonna touch that house.

07:36.389 --> 07:37.424
That's what happened there."

07:37.424 --> 07:38.927
(congregation cheers)

07:38.927 --> 07:42.902
So I tell you what, I don't
think it's because I'm a pastor.

07:42.902 --> 07:44.806
I don't think it's
because I'm a man of God.

07:44.806 --> 07:48.246
But I do think that you can
rest a little bit easier tonight

07:48.246 --> 07:50.951
knowing that God
is protecting you

07:50.951 --> 07:53.222
from things you
have not seen yet.

07:53.222 --> 07:54.993
He is protecting you from forces

07:54.993 --> 07:57.932
that you cannot
fight on your own.

07:57.932 --> 07:58.834
This is our God.

08:01.907 --> 08:03.744
Come on, somebody if
you believe in him-

08:03.744 --> 08:06.883
(congregation cheers)

08:06.883 --> 08:08.654
- [Tiff] Felt like he
was preaching just to me.

08:08.654 --> 08:09.956
- We're leaving
with this tonight.

08:09.956 --> 08:11.392
- [Tiff] And-

08:11.392 --> 08:12.194
- Just remember this.

08:12.194 --> 08:14.131
- It was life-changing.

08:15.266 --> 08:17.104
- It overflows.

08:17.104 --> 08:21.212
- Like, I'm lost
and now I'm found.

08:22.515 --> 08:26.890
- Carl's primary gift, I
think, just in life is charm.

08:28.026 --> 08:33.102
He has a way of
seeming fairy genuine.

08:33.904 --> 08:35.407
- Something's going on with him.

08:35.407 --> 08:36.676
Oh yeah, he goes and he
listens to your speeches.

08:36.676 --> 08:38.312
- [Speaker] I think
he's an amazing actor.

08:38.312 --> 08:41.285
(soft anxious music)

08:47.230 --> 08:51.305
- I felt awkward when I first
started going to Hillsong.

08:51.305 --> 08:52.542
In fact, I didn't want to go.

08:52.542 --> 08:54.612
Ashley forced me to go.
Ashley's my daughter.

08:54.612 --> 08:56.048
- Alright, you gonna say grace?

08:56.048 --> 08:57.017
- Yes.
- Okay.

08:57.017 --> 08:58.721
I was like, "You should come."

08:58.721 --> 09:01.493
And she's like,
"Absolutely not." (laughs)

09:01.493 --> 09:05.266
- That was the
oldest person there.

09:05.266 --> 09:08.339
- I think she liked knowing
that I felt so connected to it,

09:08.339 --> 09:11.747
and she started coming to
the services and, you know,

09:11.747 --> 09:12.982
she was a superstar.

09:17.157 --> 09:19.194
- Would you like to
know how I met Carl?

09:22.167 --> 09:25.908
I was leaving church
down the back stairway,

09:25.908 --> 09:29.916
and Carl and Laura were
coming downstairs and I said,

09:29.916 --> 09:31.620
"Oh, Pastor Carl,

09:31.620 --> 09:35.761
I was hoping I'd get to
meet you. I'm Mary Jones."

09:35.761 --> 09:37.498
He said, "Oh, I
know who you are.

09:37.498 --> 09:39.067
I've been dying to meet you.

09:39.067 --> 09:42.274
So I'm glad that my wife
and I get to meet you."

09:42.274 --> 09:43.744
- When you talk to Carl,

09:43.744 --> 09:46.048
if you got a chance
to talk to Carl,

09:46.048 --> 09:48.052
I don't know, you
felt so special.

09:51.225 --> 09:53.797
- I became known in
church as Mama Jones.

09:55.868 --> 09:59.642
I felt that inside of Carl,
there's something good.

10:01.412 --> 10:04.184
I don't know that there was a
sermon that he ever preached

10:04.184 --> 10:05.788
that he didn't cry.

10:05.788 --> 10:08.359
- I love you. I
refuse to cry tonight.

10:08.359 --> 10:10.865
- But I'm gonna say this,

10:10.865 --> 10:13.102
I think Carl could cry on cue.

10:14.071 --> 10:15.641
He held the
microphone, he'll go.

10:18.112 --> 10:21.520
And I know I'm not making
the right face, but (laughs)

10:21.520 --> 10:22.555
if he sees this,

10:22.555 --> 10:24.859
he's probably gonna
hate me for saying this.

10:24.859 --> 10:26.328
But it was funny. I mean-

10:26.328 --> 10:27.430
- Great sermon. You don't
have to be a superstar.

10:27.430 --> 10:29.936
- It really touched me
when he would do that.

10:31.372 --> 10:33.911
- Grateful that Jesus
saved your life. Anybody?

10:33.911 --> 10:35.246
Anybody? Anybody?

10:35.246 --> 10:37.150
Don't show this,
Byron. This is fake.

10:37.150 --> 10:38.821
(Byron laughs)

10:38.821 --> 10:40.089
- [Ashley] Carl Lentz has

10:40.089 --> 10:42.327
this very specific
type of confidence.

10:42.327 --> 10:43.931
Oh like yo, he gets it.

I don't remember what
he said, but like,

10:57.625 --> 11:00.430
Carl Lentz is just so charming.

11:00.430 --> 11:02.334
- All the single people,

11:11.987 --> 11:14.559
of 7,000 people each Sunday.

11:14.559 --> 11:17.130
- He was mobbed by the
congregants in the same way

any other celebrity would be.

old husband and father

is not your average pastor.

11:27.518 --> 11:30.658
- [Alex] He was this tall,
handsome statuesque guy

11:30.658 --> 11:33.664
really into fashion, and he
wore this Yves Saint Laurent

11:38.272 --> 11:41.713

11:41.713 --> 11:44.184
- Very deep V-neck shirts,

11:44.184 --> 11:47.057
like I mean the deepest V
you've ever seen in your life

11:47.057 --> 11:48.560
of anybody who's not at a gym.

11:48.560 --> 11:51.633
- Hold up, let's see what's
going on with his (beep) shorts.

11:51.633 --> 11:53.770
- [Alex] So he was really
something to look at.

11:53.770 --> 11:55.173
- [Carl] You keep
your eyes on Jesus.

11:55.173 --> 11:57.945
- There is a sense that
pastors not only can be cool,

11:57.945 --> 12:01.352
but can be attractive like hot.

12:02.555 --> 12:05.828
(congregation cheers)

12:10.971 --> 12:13.810
- My wife Laura Lentz
is here with me.

12:13.810 --> 12:14.746
She's amazing.

12:16.783 --> 12:19.522
I refuse to cry
tonight. That's my goal.

12:19.522 --> 12:24.431
But I will say that the
love of my life you are.

12:24.431 --> 12:26.937
We have three children,
three products of passion

12:26.937 --> 12:28.072
(congregation laughs)

12:28.072 --> 12:30.076
and we pastor Hillsong
New York City.

12:31.713 --> 12:33.182
- [Alex] Carl and Laura

12:33.182 --> 12:35.353
are the husband and
wife pastoral team.

12:36.756 --> 12:39.394
All of these preachers, you
know, they get married young

12:39.394 --> 12:41.499
because your pastor
needs to be married.

12:42.868 --> 12:45.173
- Again, achurch is supposed
to be a reflection of family.

12:47.177 --> 12:50.584
You never want to get caught
having a church that's good,

12:50.584 --> 12:52.822
but your family's kind of dying.

12:52.822 --> 12:54.892
(children chattering)

12:54.892 --> 12:58.567
If we take care of our
marriage and our family,

12:58.567 --> 12:59.802
church will take
care of himself.

12:59.802 --> 13:01.271
Your brother told
me the first day...

13:01.271 --> 13:03.510
So we don't have a lot of room

13:03.510 --> 13:05.079
to not practice what we preach.

13:05.079 --> 13:08.486
(gentle pensive music)

13:09.555 --> 13:11.058
- A small card from Laura,

13:12.962 --> 13:15.199
"I saw you worshiping
in church tonight

13:15.199 --> 13:17.638
and was just
overwhelmed and thankful

13:17.638 --> 13:20.511
that you are part of what
we are building here.

13:20.511 --> 13:23.282
Carl and I appreciate you.

13:23.282 --> 13:25.453
Have a blessed week.
Love, Laura Lentz."

13:26.690 --> 13:28.593
That is, (laughs)

13:28.593 --> 13:31.031
that is the gold in
the garbage here, so.

13:33.169 --> 13:34.071
Yeah.

13:35.406 --> 13:39.081
- Laura, she was like
the mother of the church.

13:39.081 --> 13:40.851
She didn't have like, you know,

13:40.851 --> 13:43.022
the stage magnetism
that Carl had,

13:43.022 --> 13:46.061
but I think she
believed in his mission

13:46.061 --> 13:47.531
in a rather selfless way,

13:48.934 --> 13:52.340
as if she had an understanding
of Carl belongs to the world.

13:54.746 --> 13:59.187
At Hillsong it was an ensemble
cast built around the star.

13:59.187 --> 14:01.025
(congregation cheers)

14:01.025 --> 14:02.427
Carl was the star.

14:04.231 --> 14:06.970
- There would be no Hillsong
New York without Carl Lentz.

14:13.984 --> 14:15.486
- I love you, Brian
and Bobbie Houston.

14:15.486 --> 14:18.325
I'm gonna take a moment
and make this awkward,

14:18.325 --> 14:20.497
because I represent a lot of
people that really love you

14:20.497 --> 14:23.202
and forget about the church
that you have, the family,

14:23.202 --> 14:27.945
and the marriage, and who you
are outside of the platform.

14:27.945 --> 14:29.916
That in and of itself
could be its own movie.

14:29.916 --> 14:31.452
(congregation applauds)

14:31.452 --> 14:32.922
Can you stand to your feet and
give Brian and Bobbie Houston

14:32.922 --> 14:34.726
a huge hand tonight?

14:34.726 --> 14:36.361
- I thought Carl was Hillsong.

14:37.698 --> 14:41.138
As we started digging in, it
did take a minute to understand

14:41.138 --> 14:44.846
that there was this monolithic
leader behind Carl Lentz.

14:44.846 --> 14:46.081
- [Carl] Thank you, Bishop,

14:46.081 --> 14:47.585
the Big Eagle and
the Mother Dove.

14:48.754 --> 14:50.056
- [Alex] That's Brian Houston.

14:50.056 --> 14:52.862
(tense music)

14:53.830 --> 14:55.032
- Well, I'm Brian Houston.

14:55.032 --> 14:56.603
- And I'm Bobbi Houston.

14:56.603 --> 14:59.742
- [Alex] Brian and his wife
Bobbie founded Hillsong in 1983

14:59.742 --> 15:01.345
in the suburbs of Sydney.

15:04.084 --> 15:06.054
- I don't think I realized

15:06.054 --> 15:07.591
in learning about
Hillsong New York

15:07.591 --> 15:11.800
that it was actually part of
this global church movement

15:11.800 --> 15:13.603
that started in Australia.

15:13.603 --> 15:17.010
(tense music continues)

15:19.582 --> 15:23.289
(congregation cheers)

15:23.289 --> 15:25.794
- Hillsong presents
itself on the outside

15:25.794 --> 15:29.468
as this progressive idea or
a progressive belief set.

15:29.468 --> 15:30.938
- Jesus Christ.

15:30.938 --> 15:32.541
- [Alex] But Brian Houston
is a conservative guy.

15:32.541 --> 15:36.315
- And worship and so on
is very contemporary.

15:36.315 --> 15:39.221
But if you like our theology,
it's very conservative.

15:39.221 --> 15:40.791
- [Alex] His core
beliefs are rooted

15:40.791 --> 15:43.563
in old-school Pentecostalism.

15:43.563 --> 15:46.201
(upbeat music)

15:47.505 --> 15:52.046
- Pentecostalism is a
global evangelical movement.

15:53.415 --> 15:57.725
Pentecostalism is marked by
demonstrations of the spirit,

15:57.725 --> 15:59.729
things like speaking in tongue-

15:59.729 --> 16:02.768
(attendee speaking in tongues)

16:02.768 --> 16:05.974
- [Katelyn] Receiving
messages from God directly.

16:07.812 --> 16:09.247
Dreams and visions.

16:09.247 --> 16:11.084
- Snake and horrible
things, people's faces.

16:12.153 --> 16:13.623
- [Katelyn] Healings,
physical healings.

16:13.623 --> 16:16.028
- In the name of Jesus!

16:16.028 --> 16:19.267
(congregation cheers)

16:21.906 --> 16:23.543
- [Crew Member] Just gonna
stop with you for a few secs.

16:23.543 --> 16:24.879
There's a fly.

16:24.879 --> 16:27.183
- Oh! That's not great.

16:27.183 --> 16:28.687
- [Crew Member] No,
no. You got this.

16:28.687 --> 16:32.360
- Actually, the Pentecostals
would say this is demonic.

16:32.360 --> 16:33.429
- [Crew Member] Oh, really?

16:33.429 --> 16:36.669
- This is a
distraction. (laughs)

16:36.669 --> 16:37.638
- [Commentator]
Sorry (indistinct).

16:40.076 --> 16:43.482
- Pentecostals, they're
a little extreme.

16:44.819 --> 16:48.527
(explosion popping)

16:48.527 --> 16:51.499
There is often also a
political dimension.

16:52.868 --> 16:57.043
Lots of mobilization around
traditional family values.

16:57.043 --> 16:59.014
The pro-life cause,

16:59.014 --> 17:02.888
against, you know, LGBT
rights and equality.

17:02.888 --> 17:05.459
- God who created marriage
said marriages should be

17:05.459 --> 17:08.299
between a man and a woman
in a lifetime relationship.

17:08.299 --> 17:09.769
- One elephant in the rooms

17:09.769 --> 17:12.608
for the church all around
the world right now

17:12.608 --> 17:14.110
is the gay situation.

17:14.110 --> 17:17.818
- [Katelyn] Leading up
into the 2016 election,

17:17.818 --> 17:22.360
81% of white evangelicals
who voted for Donald Trump.

17:22.360 --> 17:24.632
- Well, what an honor to be
stranded in the White House

17:24.632 --> 17:27.470
and to have just had the chance
to pray for President Trump.

17:27.470 --> 17:29.441
- Was this about
following Christ

17:29.441 --> 17:31.512
and living out his teachings

17:31.512 --> 17:34.117
or was this about
consolidating power?

17:34.117 --> 17:39.160
(kettle whistling)
(uneasy music)

17:44.070 --> 17:49.147
- Hillsong is a
Pentecostal church.

17:50.283 --> 17:51.886
Most people probably
wouldn't know that,

17:51.886 --> 17:54.124
might be surprised to find out.

17:55.259 --> 17:58.332
When I was there it was
very kind of undercover.

17:58.332 --> 17:59.769
They do have services where,

17:59.769 --> 18:03.042
where they do speak in tongues
and do pray over people.

18:03.042 --> 18:06.415
- Speaking of the tongues as
the spirit gives you utterance.

18:06.415 --> 18:09.287
And we should be open to the
speaking in other tongues.

18:09.287 --> 18:13.630
(Brian speaking in tongues)

18:13.630 --> 18:16.201
- And I think the more
Hillsong has wanted

18:16.201 --> 18:17.838
to be more mainstream
and seem cool,

18:17.838 --> 18:19.307
like I think that's
one of the things

18:19.307 --> 18:23.148
that quickly kind of
got shoved to the side.

18:23.148 --> 18:25.721
- Can I get a Pentecostal
amen through the screen?

18:26.990 --> 18:28.092
Back to the message.

18:28.092 --> 18:30.764
(tense music)

18:32.133 --> 18:34.437
- [Alex] It was Hillsong's
first American location.

18:34.437 --> 18:37.176
- New York isn't necessarily
the first place you would think

18:37.176 --> 18:39.615
to plant a new
Pentecostal church.

18:39.615 --> 18:42.621
- New York was known as a place
where churches come to die.

18:42.621 --> 18:45.159
(tense music)

18:46.896 --> 18:50.604
- If they wanted to bring
their spin on Christianity

18:50.604 --> 18:53.677
to new audiences, to the
center of media attention,

18:53.677 --> 18:54.945
there really couldn't
be a better place

18:54.945 --> 18:56.315
than New York to do it.

18:56.315 --> 18:58.319
- It was cool, it was
hip and, you know,

18:58.319 --> 19:01.526
New York loves like
the new hip thing.

19:01.526 --> 19:03.630
- [Speaker] Carl appeared on
platforms where the church

19:03.630 --> 19:06.134
would have an opportunity to
appeal to a younger audience.

19:06.134 --> 19:07.571
- Especially in New York,

19:07.571 --> 19:09.174
we've dealt with the
whole generation of people

19:09.174 --> 19:11.746
that have run from church
just 'cause it's been scary,

19:11.746 --> 19:14.284
it's been weird,
it's been like rules.

19:14.284 --> 19:16.789
And when you meet
Jesus, we believe,

19:16.789 --> 19:19.595
it's not you have to,
it's a you get to.

19:21.599 --> 19:23.035
- When I started at
Hillsong New York City,

19:23.035 --> 19:25.006
I was a volunteer.

19:25.006 --> 19:26.909
Obviously I wasn't paid
but everybody was so happy

19:26.909 --> 19:28.980
to pitch in whatever they
needed to all the time

19:28.980 --> 19:30.617
in any kind of way.

19:30.617 --> 19:33.623
- Irving Plaza where
we met is a nightclub,

19:33.623 --> 19:37.531
and you know, we would get
in there early in the morning

19:37.531 --> 19:42.407
and it would just be sticky
with beer all over the floor.

19:43.475 --> 19:46.549
The smells were very
exciting smells.

19:46.549 --> 19:48.252
- Carl would always say
"Church in the wild,

19:48.252 --> 19:49.955
church in the wild
is what we're doing."

19:49.955 --> 19:52.360
As a volunteer meet, clean
up vomit or, you know,

19:52.360 --> 19:54.197
weed in the garbage or whatever.

19:54.197 --> 19:56.636
Nobody cared at all because
it was such an adventure

19:56.636 --> 19:59.207
and it was such a privilege
to be a part of it.

20:00.409 --> 20:04.919
- We were on the cusp
of doing something

20:04.919 --> 20:07.791
that hadn't been done before.

20:07.791 --> 20:12.868
We were planting a Hillsong
Church in New York City.

20:15.005 --> 20:17.310
- Our church is a year
and a couple months old

20:17.310 --> 20:19.180
and will you promise
me you'll pray

20:19.180 --> 20:21.218
for Hillsong Church
New York City?

20:21.218 --> 20:22.688
Oh, nine of you. Great.

20:22.688 --> 20:24.023
That makes me feel better.
All I needed was one.

20:24.023 --> 20:25.494
(congregation applauds)

20:25.494 --> 20:28.432
- There was so much potential
for what it was gonna be.

20:28.432 --> 20:31.271
(uneasy music)

20:38.252 --> 20:39.955
- [Speaker] We happen
to have Joel and Carl.

20:39.955 --> 20:42.160
- Tell us what's going on,
what's happening in New York.

20:42.160 --> 20:44.297
- Where do you wanna start?

20:44.297 --> 20:46.001
- Sounded like an
impossible thing to do.

20:46.001 --> 20:47.403
Which had our name all over.

20:47.403 --> 20:49.742
(suspenseful music)

20:49.742 --> 20:53.315
- Carl and Joel Houston,
who's Brian Houston's son,

20:53.315 --> 20:55.386
started Hillsong
New York together.

20:55.386 --> 20:57.156
That was sort of the
dream that they had had

20:57.156 --> 21:00.262
since they were college
students together in Australia.

21:00.262 --> 21:02.601
And that was when Carl
first caught Brian's eye

21:02.601 --> 21:06.108
as sort of a golden
boy or a protege.

21:06.108 --> 21:10.349
He found in Carl a world-class
talent as far as preaching.

21:13.322 --> 21:14.492
- Joel Houston is
one of the great

21:14.492 --> 21:16.696
Christian singer-songwriters
of all time.

21:16.696 --> 21:19.334
So Joel had the music and
Carl did the preaching

21:19.334 --> 21:21.639
and together they were
an unstoppable force.

21:21.639 --> 21:22.975
(congregation cheers)

21:22.975 --> 21:24.578
- Hillsong music,
that's actually

21:24.578 --> 21:28.686
a lot of people gateway
drug into Hillsong.

21:28.686 --> 21:31.893
It's phenomenal, it's
beautiful, it's emotional.

21:31.893 --> 21:35.432
- In fact, a lot of people
knew about Hillsong's music

21:35.432 --> 21:37.504
before they knew that
Hillsong was a church.

21:42.714 --> 21:44.785
- My mom started taking
the piano recitals

21:44.785 --> 21:48.192
when I was in second grade,
and I've actually did listen

21:48.192 --> 21:50.296
to Hillsong as a kid.

21:53.302 --> 21:56.474
When I enlisted
at 17 in the Army,

21:56.474 --> 22:00.650
I did deploy to Iraq and
I got medically discharged

22:02.855 --> 22:05.426
dealing with the aftermath
of a lot of that.

22:05.426 --> 22:08.432
Like, I wasn't doing
well for a while.

22:13.710 --> 22:16.348
- I was so hurt from a breakup.

22:18.485 --> 22:22.026
I get on the train and
my heart just like,

22:22.026 --> 22:23.830
oh, it cried out,

22:23.830 --> 22:26.001
"Man, I wish I was in
church this morning."

22:26.001 --> 22:29.073
(suspenseful music)

22:30.442 --> 22:32.915
And then I get off the train
and I have a Facebook message.

22:33.983 --> 22:35.319
A friend of mine said,

22:35.319 --> 22:37.824
"I don't know if you found
a church here in New York

22:37.824 --> 22:39.294
but I think you should
come to this place

22:39.294 --> 22:40.229
that I've been going to.

22:40.229 --> 22:42.300
I think you'll really like it.

22:42.300 --> 22:43.903
It's called Hillsong."

22:46.041 --> 22:49.615
I walked in and the music
was playing, and that was it.

22:49.615 --> 22:51.652
I was done. What do
you need me to do?

22:51.652 --> 22:54.023
I need to be a part of
whatever is happening here.

22:54.992 --> 22:56.529
They're singing about hope,

22:56.529 --> 22:59.668
they're singing about
perseverance, and
it was so special.

23:00.469 --> 23:01.906
- Go into a service,

23:01.906 --> 23:05.145
feel like I found some
like purpose in my life.

23:05.145 --> 23:06.582
I love this.

23:08.553 --> 23:11.157

23:15.634 --> 23:17.537
- Church can be an incredibly
positive experience.

23:17.537 --> 23:20.577
It gives us community,
it gives us support.

23:20.577 --> 23:23.516
We were not called to
do this life alone.

23:23.516 --> 23:25.219
- When I had got to
Hillsong New York,

23:25.219 --> 23:27.490
I was only there
for a few months

23:27.490 --> 23:30.229
and I ended up finding
myself on stage

23:30.229 --> 23:32.567
playing it with Carl Lentz.

23:32.567 --> 23:33.770
- There were cars
that would say like,

23:33.770 --> 23:35.874
"Hey would you
like to volunteer?"

23:35.874 --> 23:38.145
I had written down
that I was a singer.

23:38.145 --> 23:39.782
That Sunday I auditioned.

23:39.782 --> 23:42.521
The next Sunday I sang on stage.

23:44.090 --> 23:46.562
- [Dan] Each week something
like 50 million people

23:46.562 --> 23:48.633
are singing Hillsong
worship songs.

23:48.633 --> 23:50.069
So what's happening
on stage in New York

23:50.069 --> 23:52.541
and what's being presented
on social media in New York

23:52.541 --> 23:55.847
is really happening
all across the globe.

23:59.320 --> 24:00.857
These albums are
always charting.

24:00.857 --> 24:03.896
They were reaching like the
non-Christian music charts.

24:03.896 --> 24:05.700
"What a Beautiful
Name" won a Grammy.

24:05.700 --> 24:09.575
- This is an absolutely
incredible honor.

24:09.575 --> 24:11.812
- I did have this
moment of like,

24:11.812 --> 24:13.816
I'm gonna change the
trajectory of my life.

24:13.816 --> 24:15.352
- I was just all Hillsong now.

24:29.782 --> 24:33.322

24:33.322 --> 24:37.129
- Instagram officially
launched on October 6th, 2010.

24:37.129 --> 24:40.970
Hillsong New York officially
launched on October 17th, 2010.

24:40.970 --> 24:44.545
So Instagram and
influencer culture

24:44.545 --> 24:47.684
was always in the water
with Hillsong New York.

24:47.684 --> 24:49.187
- [Speaker] Added
to this was the fact

24:49.187 --> 24:51.625
that their headquarters
were based in Williamsburg,

24:51.625 --> 24:53.763
the epicenter of the
2010s hipster movement.

24:55.132 --> 24:57.904
- Carl's inner circle lived
at a building in Williamsburg,

24:57.904 --> 25:01.812
184 Kent, and that became
known as The Compound,

25:01.812 --> 25:03.616
and that was where
the pastors partied.

25:03.616 --> 25:04.651
It was where they hung out.

25:04.651 --> 25:06.555
- Welcome to the partey.

25:06.555 --> 25:08.826
- People like Carl
Lentz saw Instagram

25:08.826 --> 25:13.936
as a way to advertise
a cool Christian faith.

25:15.005 --> 25:15.940
- [Announcer] From
the Crystal Cathedral

25:15.940 --> 25:17.878

25:17.878 --> 25:20.115
- [Katelyn] So just as
pastors and ministry leaders

25:20.115 --> 25:23.723
in the '70s and '80s
really embraced television.

25:23.723 --> 25:24.691
- [Jim] Hi, Tammy Faye.

25:24.691 --> 25:26.562
- [Tammy] Hi, Jim Bakker.

25:26.562 --> 25:28.566
- [Katelyn] Instagram
has the power

25:28.566 --> 25:30.937
to reach an
international audience.

25:30.937 --> 25:33.576
- [Alex] Is Carl accumulated
more and more followers-

25:33.576 --> 25:35.279
- Jesus didn't have a Snapchat.

25:35.279 --> 25:37.483
- [Alex] His cultural cache
grew and he was able to mix

25:37.483 --> 25:40.389
with athletes,
celebrities, musicians.

25:40.389 --> 25:41.959
- I just wanna love Carl more.

25:41.959 --> 25:43.428
- You're doing a
good job with that.

25:43.428 --> 25:44.363
- [Elvis] You went to Hillsong?

25:44.363 --> 25:45.432
- Yes.
- Our friend Carl Lentz,

25:45.432 --> 25:46.434
who we love.

25:46.434 --> 25:48.806
- I felt very empowered
when I walked out.

25:48.806 --> 25:50.109
How great is this?

25:50.109 --> 25:52.881
- He pioneered
celebrity pastor culture

25:52.881 --> 25:54.885
for this generation.

25:54.885 --> 25:57.691
I think he's the first
sort of hype priest.

25:59.160 --> 26:02.934
- Lots of Carl mini-mes,
everyone looked up to him,

26:02.934 --> 26:04.671
some people idolized him.

26:04.671 --> 26:06.107
- You are our hero.

26:06.107 --> 26:09.615
I mean, look at this
guy. Carl Lentz, folks.

26:10.984 --> 26:14.525
- In 2014 there was probably
what was the trademark moment

26:14.525 --> 26:18.031
of Carl's reign which is when
he baptized Justin Bieber

26:18.031 --> 26:21.739
in the basketball player
Tyson Chandler's bathtub.

26:21.739 --> 26:25.479

26:25.479 --> 26:27.651
(car hits)
(person cries)

26:27.651 --> 26:28.452
- [Carl] He was
going through it.

26:28.452 --> 26:30.322
He was like I wanna start fresh.

26:30.322 --> 26:31.792
- So I reached out to...

26:31.792 --> 26:33.896
Some people I really
know care about me

26:33.896 --> 26:36.602
and who happened to
be in the church,

26:36.602 --> 26:38.806
stayed with their family
for a couple months

26:38.806 --> 26:41.211
and literally just
did regular stuff,

26:41.211 --> 26:42.146
ate dinner with them,

26:43.616 --> 26:45.887
and it just brought this
sense of humbleness.

26:47.289 --> 26:49.895
And the way he lives his life
is really what he talks about.

26:49.895 --> 26:52.199
Like when I go to his
home, I feel really loved.

26:52.199 --> 26:54.838
♪ 'Cause I'm on

26:54.838 --> 26:58.011
♪ I'm on top of the world ♪

26:58.011 --> 27:01.184
- He was being followed by
a million paparazzi people

27:01.184 --> 27:03.455
and I finally called my
buddy, Tyson Chandler.

27:03.455 --> 27:05.727
I said, "I'm with Justin,
we want to baptize him."

27:05.727 --> 27:08.298
And he's like, "Come
and use my bathtub,

27:08.298 --> 27:10.570

made for a seven footer.

27:10.570 --> 27:11.639
- [Interviewer] And it's
two o'clock in the morning?

27:11.639 --> 27:13.074
- It's two o'clock
in the morning.

27:13.074 --> 27:14.845
You don't just dip
your toe in it.

27:14.845 --> 27:17.383
You know, God's grace
covers your entire body.

27:17.383 --> 27:20.355
(slow funky music)

27:27.136 --> 27:30.008
- [Speaker] Nick established
Carl as a cultural force,

27:30.008 --> 27:32.046
and it created kind
of a feedback loop.

27:34.016 --> 27:35.185
- Mama-

27:35.185 --> 27:36.187
- Hi, Kathy!

27:36.187 --> 27:36.956
- Met Oprah.

27:36.956 --> 27:38.759
- For Carl, his fame became

27:38.759 --> 27:41.765
not just sort of
anthropological oddity,

27:41.765 --> 27:42.934
but the thing itself.

27:45.272 --> 27:47.209
And it gave power
against the sense,

27:47.209 --> 27:49.280
if these big stars
were attracted to Carl

27:49.280 --> 27:52.253
and everything he was offering,
why wouldn't I be too?

27:52.253 --> 27:54.858
- Just started our
9:00 PM service

27:54.858 --> 27:56.160
and it's packed to capacity,

27:56.160 --> 27:58.198
turned away hundreds
of people at 9:00 PM.

27:58.198 --> 28:02.941
We call our 11:00 AM the early
bird service in New York.

28:14.130 --> 28:17.971
(slow funky music continues)

28:26.254 --> 28:28.258
It wasn't just a thing
of like it's growing

28:28.258 --> 28:30.530
because people are
inviting people.

28:30.530 --> 28:33.736
It's growing also because
there's a line down the street

28:33.736 --> 28:35.138
and there's a velvet rope.

28:36.441 --> 28:39.615
(crowd cheers)

28:39.615 --> 28:44.891
- Reaching people with the
gospel message is growth.

28:45.693 --> 28:49.835
So what happens when growth

28:50.737 --> 28:54.110
becomes the primary goal?

28:54.110 --> 28:56.180
- Hey, Kansas City,
I am so excited

28:56.180 --> 28:59.186
because this weekend we are
launching Hillsong Church.

28:59.186 --> 29:03.896
(pastors speaking in
foreign languages)

29:05.465 --> 29:09.942
♪ Mount Everest ain't
got shit on me ♪

29:18.124 --> 29:20.262
- [Alex] You've
got 150,000 people

29:20.262 --> 29:24.203
going to Hillsong services
every week in like 30 countries,

29:24.203 --> 29:26.174
and all those people
are giving money.

29:28.211 --> 29:31.885
- Tithing is giving 10% of
your income to the church.

29:33.455 --> 29:36.327
There were also like
certain services

29:36.327 --> 29:39.300
where it was tithing
above and beyond.

29:39.300 --> 29:41.605
So you would look at your
bank account and say,

29:41.605 --> 29:44.911
"You know what, God, I wanna
present Hillsong church

29:44.911 --> 29:46.347
with this amount."

29:46.347 --> 29:50.022
- So right now, as always,
we're gonna receive our giving

29:50.022 --> 29:52.694
shows you on the
screen the various ways

29:52.694 --> 29:54.965
people like to give, Bobbie...

29:54.965 --> 29:57.202
I would have no idea
how much any individuals

29:57.202 --> 30:00.208
given church and no one
gets treated any different

30:00.208 --> 30:02.246
whether they do or they don't.

30:02.246 --> 30:04.250
- Brian Houston and Hillsong

30:04.250 --> 30:07.691
introduced different
levels of worshipers.

30:07.691 --> 30:10.128
You know there was a VIP center,

30:10.128 --> 30:13.569
and if you donated a
certain amount of money

30:13.569 --> 30:14.971
as a kingdom builder

30:14.971 --> 30:17.343
you could get to have
coffee with Brian,

30:17.343 --> 30:20.550
which starts to sound like
a pyramid selling scheme.

30:20.550 --> 30:24.256
- Hillsong and money is like a
little bit of a broken record

30:24.256 --> 30:26.662
for a lot of people
because it's, you know,

30:26.662 --> 30:29.233
so inaccurate on so many levels.

30:30.803 --> 30:35.813
- The money, from my
understanding, was
counted and then...

30:39.521 --> 30:40.523
I don't know.

30:47.804 --> 30:50.543
- [Alex] Brian's finances
are incredibly opaque.

30:53.181 --> 30:55.285
It was reported that
the Houstons had access

30:55.285 --> 30:58.158
to a million dollar church
paid expense account,

30:59.260 --> 31:00.997
that included luxury cars

31:00.997 --> 31:03.401
as well as solely
funded overseas tours

31:03.401 --> 31:06.407
where Brian would earn
up to $20,000 per speech.

31:09.213 --> 31:12.486
- There's probably more
than 20 Hillsong entities,

31:12.486 --> 31:15.025
you know, an entity
for Hillsong College,

31:15.025 --> 31:18.999
an entity for a music
composition, cafes,

31:18.999 --> 31:21.437
and you don't have
any visibility really

31:21.437 --> 31:24.276
of the flow of money
between those entities.

31:27.015 --> 31:30.590
They benefit from tax
deductibility status.

31:30.590 --> 31:34.631
So tens and tens of
millions of dollars a year

31:34.631 --> 31:37.704
flowing in largely untaxed.

31:37.704 --> 31:39.440
- [Dan] They're able to
sort of have it both ways.

31:39.440 --> 31:41.879
They're able to
avoid the oversight

31:41.879 --> 31:44.918
that secular industries
might be more accustomed to.

31:44.918 --> 31:46.955
On the other hand,
Hillsong is in many ways

31:46.955 --> 31:48.926
playing the same game as
those secular industries.

31:48.926 --> 31:51.030
They're competing
in the same spaces,

31:51.030 --> 31:52.232
appearing on the same charts.

31:53.936 --> 31:56.708
- Yes, it's a church, but
it looks like a corporation.

31:56.708 --> 31:58.311
It acts like a corporation.

31:58.311 --> 32:00.583
When it gets into
trouble it hires lawyers

32:00.583 --> 32:02.486
who do damage control.

32:02.486 --> 32:05.258
This is a 30-year
brand and successful.

32:07.597 --> 32:11.672
- And I think it's a
matter for congregants.

32:11.672 --> 32:12.974
What are you okay with?

32:12.974 --> 32:15.813
Like are you okay
with your church

32:15.813 --> 32:18.118
functioning as a business?

32:18.118 --> 32:20.088
Because the system
benefits those

32:20.088 --> 32:21.525
who are running the system,

32:23.027 --> 32:26.134
but the services, you
know, the day-to-day,

32:26.134 --> 32:28.471
those are actually run
by unpaid volunteers.

32:31.010 --> 32:35.018
Every church functions
because of volunteerism,

32:35.018 --> 32:38.091
but here it is a matter
of keeping overhead down

32:39.026 --> 32:40.730
to maximize profit.

32:40.730 --> 32:43.969
(congregation cheers)

32:49.113 --> 32:52.019
eers)

32:52.019 --> 32:55.593
- Megachurches are generally
defined as a church over 2,000.

32:55.593 --> 33:00.402
They really became a cultural
phenomenon in the mid-1990s.

33:03.141 --> 33:04.878
The church as a
whole is built around

33:04.878 --> 33:10.155
a very capitalist model of get
money, get property, expand.

33:10.823 --> 33:12.025
How big can we get?

33:12.025 --> 33:13.127
How many sites can we get?

33:13.127 --> 33:15.365
How many souls can we win?

33:15.365 --> 33:18.071
We were so determined to
figure out if we could do it,

33:18.071 --> 33:20.008
we never stopped to
ask if we should.

33:22.346 --> 33:26.989
- Early days you might
see 30, 40 volunteers

33:26.989 --> 33:28.424
making things work.

33:28.424 --> 33:32.299
Once it started to grow where
we are doing six services,

33:32.299 --> 33:34.069
you have to have at least
like a thousand people

33:34.069 --> 33:35.673
doing those things each day.

33:37.075 --> 33:42.085
- So it's your job to come to
church again, volunteer again,

33:42.887 --> 33:44.156
start loving people again.

33:44.156 --> 33:45.191
Come on, somebody, if
you hear me right now.

33:45.191 --> 33:48.666
(congregation cheers)

33:48.666 --> 33:50.770
- Broadly speaking, there
have been two groups

33:50.770 --> 33:52.272
of Hillsong volunteers.

33:52.272 --> 33:54.276
The group that's very happy,

33:54.276 --> 33:55.646
they don't have to
do that much work

33:55.646 --> 33:58.184
and they were enjoying the
spoils of all the success.

33:59.554 --> 34:01.190
And then there was another
group of Hillsong volunteers

34:01.190 --> 34:02.326
who felt bad.

34:03.127 --> 34:04.564
They were being exploited.

34:04.564 --> 34:06.334
They felt that they were
working long hours for no pay,

34:06.334 --> 34:08.004
no real chance of advancement,

34:08.004 --> 34:12.379
and that this was all being
done in the name of a spectacle

34:12.379 --> 34:14.618
that was not really for them.

34:15.720 --> 34:19.159
- Hillsong culture is
loyalty to Hillsong.

34:20.295 --> 34:23.201
You are a small part
of the big thing

34:23.201 --> 34:25.071
God is doing on the earth,

34:25.071 --> 34:27.777
and what an honor.

34:28.879 --> 34:30.348
Can you believe
we get to do this?

34:32.987 --> 34:34.390
- They would always say that,

34:34.390 --> 34:35.726
"Can you believe
we get to do this?"

34:35.726 --> 34:37.462
And it was this way of sort
of getting people to be like,

34:37.462 --> 34:40.402
"This is so cool.
This is awesome."

34:40.402 --> 34:42.707
And the first project
I actually worked on,

34:42.707 --> 34:45.579
I was in the studio
for about three weeks.

34:45.579 --> 34:48.652
We'd be in there sometimes
more than 12 hours a day.

34:48.652 --> 34:52.125
And it was like a day
rate of like $180.

34:52.125 --> 34:54.263
Maybe a little less than that.

34:55.700 --> 34:58.672
- Hillsong musicians are some
of the foremost ambassadors

34:58.672 --> 34:59.774
of the church.

34:59.774 --> 35:01.745
They're also some of the
laborers who are working

35:01.745 --> 35:03.348
under the most
grueling conditions,

35:03.348 --> 35:05.318
because of the touring schedule

35:05.318 --> 35:08.826
and the need for more
and more and more music.

35:08.826 --> 35:11.832
(gentle piano music)

35:15.640 --> 35:19.079
At the same time, the people
who are actually performing

35:19.079 --> 35:20.616
some of the church's
biggest hits

35:20.616 --> 35:23.187
aren't really seeing any
of the money from it.

35:26.995 --> 35:28.264
- There were many times,

35:28.264 --> 35:29.433
especially when the
work wasn't frequent,

35:29.433 --> 35:31.304
that it would get really scary.

35:31.304 --> 35:33.842
I got into a lot of
like credit debt.

35:36.147 --> 35:38.384
Trying to rationalize
that now is hard,

35:40.690 --> 35:44.129
but I can remember
then I felt so lucky.

35:44.129 --> 35:48.404
(gentle piano music continues)

35:51.444 --> 35:53.047
- You need your systems in place

35:53.047 --> 35:57.122
to meet the needs of the people
who are in your community.

35:57.122 --> 36:01.765
And I think where it gets
tricky is when the expansion

36:01.765 --> 36:05.906
is going faster than the ability
to still show compassion,

36:05.906 --> 36:07.309
to still meet needs.

36:10.683 --> 36:13.922
- I think I had a really
good relationship with Carl.

36:13.922 --> 36:15.458
I know he respected me.

36:15.458 --> 36:18.766
I could talk to
him about problems,

36:18.766 --> 36:21.505
you know the bubbles every
like that long on my phone.

36:24.243 --> 36:26.515
There were volunteers
that were coming in

36:26.515 --> 36:30.255
and doing all of this work
and they're doing it for free.

36:31.390 --> 36:33.595
Some people, they could
not work full-time jobs

36:33.595 --> 36:35.331
with the schedules that we had.

36:36.400 --> 36:39.339
They are trying to
live in New York City

36:39.339 --> 36:41.845
with the astronomical rents.

36:41.845 --> 36:43.615
Don't know when
they're going to eat

36:43.615 --> 36:44.818
or what they're going to eat

36:44.818 --> 36:47.757
or they got an eviction
notice they're facing.

36:47.757 --> 36:50.930
They were coming to me and
asking can I get them help?

36:50.930 --> 36:53.769
Is there any way that they
can find, they can get help?

36:56.641 --> 37:00.148
The head of pastoral
care said to me,

37:00.148 --> 37:02.252
it's illegal for the church

37:02.252 --> 37:05.091
to give people
lump sums of money.

37:05.091 --> 37:07.095
I said, "No it's not.

37:07.095 --> 37:08.899
The church helps its people

37:08.899 --> 37:11.237
and people outside
of the church.

37:13.274 --> 37:14.476
Come on."

37:19.119 --> 37:20.355
It broke my heart.

37:20.355 --> 37:23.695
(somber music)

37:23.695 --> 37:25.365
- [Interviewer] And what are
you doing this conference?

37:25.365 --> 37:27.302
Hanging out?
- Yeah, we've been hanging.

37:27.302 --> 37:28.505
- Wearing supreme sweaters.

37:28.505 --> 37:29.440
- Just wearing sweaters.

37:29.440 --> 37:31.477
- Just living the dream.

37:31.477 --> 37:33.682
You've been living the
dream, honestly, right?

37:37.857 --> 37:41.832
through you to be put

37:41.832 --> 37:44.336
on the lives of people
around and about you than-

37:44.336 --> 37:47.476
- Hillsong tried to create
this image of a lifestyle

37:47.476 --> 37:50.315
and of sex appeal
and of this charisma

37:50.315 --> 37:52.419
that really has nothing
to do with church

37:53.722 --> 37:56.193
and makes a lot of their
quite reactionary social views

37:56.193 --> 37:57.630
much more palatable.

37:59.734 --> 38:02.807
They essentially
created a Trojan horse.

38:02.807 --> 38:05.946
(pensive music)

38:05.946 --> 38:09.052
- I was always trying to
resolve during my reporting

38:09.052 --> 38:12.794
what's progressive and where
the conservative strains

38:12.794 --> 38:15.365
of Christianity fit
into this equation.

38:15.365 --> 38:19.239
I always wanted to know
where they really stood

38:19.239 --> 38:23.649
on gay marriage, where they
stood on things like abortion,

38:23.649 --> 38:25.853
and I got crafted answers.

38:25.853 --> 38:28.124
- [Host] Please welcome
Pastor Carl Lentz.

38:28.124 --> 38:29.794
(audience cheers)

38:29.794 --> 38:31.998
- I wanted to say, before
we even get started,

38:31.998 --> 38:34.838
you really don't look like any
pastor that I've ever seen.

38:34.838 --> 38:37.910
- We just kind of try to
be ourselves at all times.

38:37.910 --> 38:41.751
- Hillsong is seen as a
this hip progressive church

38:41.751 --> 38:44.389
that's drawn huge
Millennial crowds,

38:44.389 --> 38:46.060
but it's still evangelical.

38:46.060 --> 38:47.730
- I mean do you
guys have positions

38:47.730 --> 38:50.301
on, say, gay marriage
and things like that?

38:50.301 --> 38:52.640
- We have a stance on love.

38:52.640 --> 38:54.544
In everything else we
have conversations.

38:54.544 --> 38:56.347
We have a stance on love

38:56.347 --> 38:59.386
and we have conversations
about everything else.

38:59.386 --> 39:00.789
- So what does that mean?

39:00.789 --> 39:01.525
- Exactly that.

39:01.525 --> 39:04.029
(everybody laughing)

39:04.029 --> 39:07.670
I think our job is
still to help people

39:07.670 --> 39:09.006
not necessarily
change how they think.

39:09.006 --> 39:11.578
We're not trying to change
anybody 'cause we can't.

39:12.813 --> 39:15.553
(pensive music)

39:16.755 --> 39:19.627
- I had a really
unusual upbringing.

39:19.627 --> 39:24.571
My dad is a traveling
evangelical pastor.

39:24.571 --> 39:26.942
We would travel
around the country

39:26.942 --> 39:30.348
and go to different churches
for two weeks at a time.

39:32.185 --> 39:34.423
- [Pastor] Hurray! Hallelujah!

39:34.423 --> 39:36.995
- When my dad would
deliver his sermon,

39:36.995 --> 39:41.638
he would say that homosexuality
is equal to murder.

39:48.417 --> 39:50.154
Probably towards high school

39:50.154 --> 39:54.162
is when I started to like
figure out I was gay.

39:54.162 --> 39:55.599
- [Pastor] In the name
of - Jesus Christ.

39:55.599 --> 39:58.070
- I was living a
very confusing life.

39:59.974 --> 40:03.481
That's one reason that I
was so drawn to Hillsong.

40:03.481 --> 40:06.120
Hillsong's biggest
tagline is welcome home.

40:07.489 --> 40:08.959
That's what you'll
see everywhere.

40:08.959 --> 40:11.932
You'll see it on banners,
you'll see it outside.

40:11.932 --> 40:15.171
They want you to feel
a part of something,

40:15.171 --> 40:20.448
and it hits things that make
you feel like you're seen.

40:29.968 --> 40:33.709
I started dating a guy and
we went to Hillsong together,

40:33.709 --> 40:35.746
and I didn't hide it.

40:37.583 --> 40:42.560
I was in a leadership
position as a frontline singer

40:43.729 --> 40:45.799
singing on stage
as one of the faces

40:45.799 --> 40:47.202
of Hillsong New York City.

40:48.872 --> 40:51.010
We would often be sitting on
like the second row together,

40:51.010 --> 40:53.080
'cause I would sing and
then I would come down

40:53.080 --> 40:54.751
and just sit with him.

40:54.751 --> 40:58.090
Hi, I'm Josh and
this is my boyfriend.

40:58.090 --> 40:59.159
- Reed.

40:59.159 --> 41:02.500
- In early 2014, I had
the exciting opportunity

41:02.500 --> 41:05.706
to go on CBS' "Survivor."

41:05.706 --> 41:09.246
I went to Pastor Carl
before I went on the show

41:09.246 --> 41:12.052
and I said, "Hey, I
just need you to know

41:12.052 --> 41:16.661
that I'm going on 'Survivor'
and I'm gonna be like honest.

41:16.661 --> 41:19.199
I really want to be
open about the church.

41:19.199 --> 41:21.070
I wanna be open about who I
am and I just wanna make sure

41:21.070 --> 41:25.579
that you're okay with
me saying Hillsong."

41:25.579 --> 41:27.717
And he was like,
"Absolutely, of course,

41:27.717 --> 41:28.852
say whatever you need to say.

41:28.852 --> 41:30.622
Like you need to be yourself."

41:32.058 --> 41:34.897
That gave me the impression
that I was still welcome

41:34.897 --> 41:37.737
and I was still at home
and I was still safe.

41:40.108 --> 41:44.116
- [Presenter] A gay couple
Christians saving themselves,

41:44.116 --> 41:45.853
adored by their church.

41:45.853 --> 41:48.725
- And so I felt really good.

41:52.967 --> 41:57.777
And then, Brian Houston
decides to release a statement.

41:59.212 --> 42:01.951
(uneasy music)

42:11.705 --> 42:16.781
"Hillsong does not agree
with the gay lifestyle

42:18.117 --> 42:20.488
and Hillsong New York does
not have a gay choir director

42:20.488 --> 42:23.795
that has a boyfriend."

42:23.795 --> 42:27.368
Pastor Brian Houston
says that I don't exist.

42:27.368 --> 42:30.074
(soft airy music)

42:37.355 --> 42:41.731
(soft airy music continues)

42:41.731 --> 42:43.702
- Why don't you agree
with same sex marriage?

42:43.702 --> 42:45.138
- Oh, I think the
Bible is clear.

42:45.138 --> 42:49.714
And so ultimately we are
dependent on the Word of God,

42:49.714 --> 42:51.049
which is scriptures.

42:51.049 --> 42:52.553
- It's not that we're
against anything,

42:52.553 --> 42:54.690
it's what we're for
what the Bible says.

42:54.690 --> 42:56.093
- But I guess my question is,

42:56.093 --> 42:58.765
in your opinion is marriage
only between a man and a woman?

42:58.765 --> 43:01.203
- We would say the
Bible is really clear

43:01.203 --> 43:03.207
that marriage is between
a man and a woman.

43:03.207 --> 43:06.447
And I believe the
Bible says what it says

43:06.447 --> 43:10.488
and I interpret it
exactly as the Bible says.

43:10.488 --> 43:12.660
- The Bible deals with the
issue of sexual activity,

43:12.660 --> 43:13.962
but it doesn't have a category

43:13.962 --> 43:16.968
for what we call sexual
orientation from birth.

43:16.968 --> 43:20.274
The bigger question we need to
keep in mind is can we expect

43:20.274 --> 43:23.582
a text that was written so
long ago in specific context

43:23.582 --> 43:25.686
to address every issue today?

43:25.686 --> 43:27.222
No, we can't expect this.

43:27.222 --> 43:30.161
We can't make the Bible into
a gay rights advocate book,

43:30.161 --> 43:32.298
because that isn't the framework
of the ancient writers.

43:32.298 --> 43:35.204
The same goes for making the
Bible an anti-gay rights book.

43:35.204 --> 43:37.910
The truth is theology
is never based simply

43:37.910 --> 43:39.379
on what the text says.

43:39.379 --> 43:42.318
Texts don't speak, they
always have to be interpreted.

43:45.424 --> 43:48.598
- On the outside Hillsong
looks super progressive,

43:48.598 --> 43:51.571
but then as you
look underneath it,

43:51.571 --> 43:56.046
at the heart of Hillsong global

43:56.046 --> 44:00.188
are really super
conservative white men

44:00.188 --> 44:03.127
and that's not
what they believe.

44:08.872 --> 44:12.011
at the heart of it,
it is come as you are

44:12.947 --> 44:14.316
and then we'll change you.

44:20.596 --> 44:22.800
ice, no peace!

44:22.800 --> 44:24.670
No justice, no peace!

44:24.670 --> 44:26.808
No justice, no peace!

44:26.808 --> 44:31.885
(tense music)
(protesters chanting)

44:35.659 --> 44:38.097
- [Janice] You know,
it's been growing unrest.

44:38.097 --> 44:40.001
- [Protesters] No
justice, no peace!

44:40.001 --> 44:42.272
No justice, no peace!

44:42.272 --> 44:46.346
- Trump is rising and
evangelicals are supporting him.

44:46.346 --> 44:50.789
But Carl is also
rising and being known

44:50.789 --> 44:52.458
as the pastor who will
say Black lives matter.

44:52.458 --> 44:56.400
- It's for me, I believe
that Black lives matter.

44:56.400 --> 44:57.703
That's what I say.

44:57.703 --> 45:01.043
There is a portion of our
community that is frustrated

45:01.043 --> 45:03.080
and they are suffering
and they are hurting.

45:03.080 --> 45:04.917
Of course, all lives matter,

45:04.917 --> 45:06.588
but it's okay to say
Black lives matter.

45:06.588 --> 45:07.623
What's wrong with you?

45:07.623 --> 45:09.527
(congregation cheers)

45:09.527 --> 45:13.033
- You have been very vocal
against racism in this country,

45:13.033 --> 45:15.606
and while many Christian
leaders in my view

45:15.606 --> 45:16.874
really stayed silent,

45:16.874 --> 45:18.678
did you worry about
losing parishioners?

45:18.678 --> 45:22.586
And also, did you get a
lot of pushback for that?

45:22.586 --> 45:23.688
- Yeah. Yes.

45:23.688 --> 45:25.626
Yes and yes. We have an issue.

45:25.626 --> 45:28.130
And some of that stuff
needs to be said upfront,

45:28.130 --> 45:29.767
out loud no matter
what you believe,

45:29.767 --> 45:31.069
no matter what your background.

45:31.069 --> 45:32.539
(audience applauds)

45:32.539 --> 45:34.476
- [Dan] Carl positioned
himself, however accurately,

45:34.476 --> 45:38.685
as on the cutting edge of race
and evangelical Christianity.

45:38.685 --> 45:43.127
- Churches might be one
of the biggest propagators

45:43.127 --> 45:46.366
of racist ideology
in our country.

45:46.366 --> 45:49.807
- But as Black
people in his church

45:49.807 --> 45:50.976
we're just not represented.

45:50.976 --> 45:54.282
(somber piano music)

45:54.282 --> 45:56.921
- One of the things Hillsong's
so known for in New York City

45:56.921 --> 45:59.225
was how diverse the church was.

45:59.225 --> 46:01.664
So from the platform you
would look out and I was like,

46:01.664 --> 46:03.033
man, this is so beautiful.

46:03.033 --> 46:05.037
Like there are so many
different people of color here.

46:05.037 --> 46:06.908
Like it's incredible.

46:06.908 --> 46:08.945
And then if you reverse it,

46:08.945 --> 46:10.983
you look at the platform
and you're like,

46:10.983 --> 46:13.454
the platform does not
represent the people

46:13.454 --> 46:15.091
in this congregation.

46:22.773 --> 46:24.242
- And Carl realized that,

46:24.242 --> 46:26.213
"Hey, we need to have
a meeting about this."

46:26.213 --> 46:30.689
- This was just our chance
to sit down with them

46:30.689 --> 46:34.029
and like kind of face to
face airing of grievances.

46:42.646 --> 46:45.351
- So people went around and
we told them how we felt.

47:09.834 --> 47:11.403
- You know we get
into this conversation

47:11.403 --> 47:15.411
about organic versus
intentional and Carl's like-

47:23.127 --> 47:24.864
- One of the guys
who's in the meeting

47:24.864 --> 47:27.201
who's a civil rights attorney,

47:27.201 --> 47:29.172
and he just laid it out
and he said, you know.

47:40.762 --> 47:43.535
- You could see Carl that the
clique went off in his head

47:43.535 --> 47:44.235
and he said-

47:48.477 --> 47:51.383
- I left the meeting just
feeling really hopeful.

47:51.383 --> 47:55.191
For the next three to four
weeks there were Black people

47:55.191 --> 47:56.527
doing the offering messages,

47:56.527 --> 47:59.700
and then it just
kind of tapered off

47:59.700 --> 48:01.136
and then it was no more.

48:02.906 --> 48:06.446
- Carl had other things to do.

48:06.446 --> 48:10.789
He was traveling, he was
chaplain of the Knicks team,

48:10.789 --> 48:12.225
he was writing a book,

48:12.225 --> 48:17.268
he was everywhere
except at Hillsong NYC.

48:19.573 --> 48:24.249
Nothing was going to happen
because it would have taken work

48:24.249 --> 48:27.121
that they were unwilling
to do, too busy to do,

48:27.121 --> 48:28.892
uninterested in doing.

48:29.960 --> 48:31.531
It's not the glamorous stuff.

48:34.670 --> 48:37.810
- Being one of the
only Black females

48:37.810 --> 48:39.580
at Hillsong Kansas City,

48:39.580 --> 48:43.487
I was included in so much
of the marketing material

48:44.690 --> 48:46.460
for a really long time.

48:46.460 --> 48:50.000
There was never like
any Black people

48:50.000 --> 48:52.205
like in actual leadership.

48:52.205 --> 48:54.375
That bugged me so much.

48:54.375 --> 48:56.113
I remember having a friend,

48:56.113 --> 48:57.649
another Black
female at Hillsong.

48:57.649 --> 49:01.591
She could see like the
racial systemic issues

49:01.591 --> 49:02.659
within the church.

49:02.659 --> 49:04.195
But she would raise her
hand and be like, "Hey,

49:04.195 --> 49:05.832
like, I see this going on,"

49:05.832 --> 49:09.540
and they just immediately
shut her down.

49:09.540 --> 49:14.382
My friend got fired, and
I was just like disgusted.

49:15.451 --> 49:18.023
A couple weeks later
I went to church

49:18.023 --> 49:19.593
just like a regular Sunday,

49:19.593 --> 49:22.298
but I felt like
something was in the air.

49:22.298 --> 49:24.904
Like I just walked in
service like normal,

49:24.904 --> 49:26.574
like grabbed a cup of coffee,

49:26.574 --> 49:29.412
said hi to a couple people,
and then I hear like,

49:29.412 --> 49:32.351
"Hey Crystal, do you
have a moment to talk?"

49:32.351 --> 49:36.092
The lead Pastor Liz literally
comes out of nowhere.

49:37.161 --> 49:39.132
"I heard you've
been walking around

49:39.132 --> 49:41.269
talking trash about
the leadership,

49:41.269 --> 49:43.073
saying you don't
trust leadership.

49:43.073 --> 49:45.612
You know if you don't leave,

49:46.681 --> 49:50.354
then we'll have the
police escort you out."

49:51.724 --> 49:54.128
- I have an officer coming
if that gets to that point.

49:54.128 --> 49:55.364
(indistinct) probably
gonna get us involved,

49:55.364 --> 49:58.303
you can be arrested
for trespassing.

49:58.303 --> 50:00.709
- [Crystal] And if
you refuse that,

50:00.709 --> 50:04.015
then we'll have the police
arrest you for trespassing.

50:05.117 --> 50:05.919
- [Officer] But they
want you to leave

50:05.919 --> 50:07.388
and you need to do that,

50:07.388 --> 50:09.025
'cause they have a legal
right to tell you to leave.

50:09.025 --> 50:11.697
- Behind her, people I've
known for like five years,

50:11.697 --> 50:15.672
I'm still walking in to
service and not even stopping

50:15.672 --> 50:17.843
to like check in.

50:17.843 --> 50:19.345
My belief in church

50:19.345 --> 50:23.555
was probably the first thing
to go that day. (chuckles)

50:23.555 --> 50:26.226
(somber music)

50:35.277 --> 50:38.785
(somber music continues)

50:41.891 --> 50:44.597
(traffic humming)

50:47.368 --> 50:49.807
- In the fall of 2017,

50:49.807 --> 50:52.613
quite a few friends
had been talking about

50:52.613 --> 50:55.284
lots of situations they
were encountering at church.

50:56.554 --> 50:58.223
There was widespread
issues that we saw

50:58.223 --> 50:59.593
and it was very alarming

50:59.593 --> 51:01.697
and it wasn't being
dealt with at all.

51:01.697 --> 51:04.469
(uneasy music)

51:10.548 --> 51:13.120
Ended up being five friends
from different backgrounds

51:13.120 --> 51:14.990
who had been invested in
the church for a long time

51:14.990 --> 51:16.527
and who cared deeply.

51:16.527 --> 51:18.096
We felt the
responsibility as leaders

51:18.096 --> 51:19.399
to do something about it.

51:19.399 --> 51:22.973
- And so the five of
us asked the leadership

51:22.973 --> 51:27.114
to call the people who are
causing problems to account.

51:31.122 --> 51:33.628
Dear Hillsong NYC staff.

51:33.628 --> 51:35.030
- When a church is
less like a family

51:35.030 --> 51:36.667
and more like an enterprise,

51:36.667 --> 51:39.873
it's leaders act
less like pastors and
more like commanders.

51:39.873 --> 51:43.380
This puts everyone in danger,
the leaders and the people.

51:43.380 --> 51:47.556
- There are verified and
widely circulated stories

51:47.556 --> 51:52.298
of inappropriate sexual behavior
amongst staff and interns.

51:56.774 --> 52:00.347
- Sweeping of messy situations
and problems under the rug.

52:00.347 --> 52:02.819
- And lack of accountability.

52:02.819 --> 52:06.794
We no longer trust the
leadership of Hillsong NYC.

52:06.794 --> 52:08.865
- The problems and concerns
voiced in this letter-

52:08.865 --> 52:12.138
- Are desperate, last
ditch endeavor to address-

52:12.138 --> 52:14.943
- And put out small fires
which have now developed

52:14.943 --> 52:16.079
into a massive inferno.

52:16.079 --> 52:17.849
- Into a massive inferno.

52:17.849 --> 52:21.724
Hillsong NYC should not join
the list of other churches

52:21.724 --> 52:25.865
and institutions that ignored
repeated outcry of victims,

52:25.865 --> 52:29.573
until some horrifying
scandal takes them down.

52:32.211 --> 52:34.215
This is deeply personal to us

52:34.215 --> 52:35.919
because this place (sobbing)...

52:35.919 --> 52:39.192
(gentle somber music)

52:42.866 --> 52:48.176
This church in this
city was our dream, too.

52:51.584 --> 52:54.990
We are disappointed
beyond measure

52:54.990 --> 52:56.761
and fearful of what is ahead

52:56.761 --> 53:00.602
if these issues
remain unchecked.

53:01.871 --> 53:04.743
Sincerely, The Five.

53:09.653 --> 53:13.126
- We had a meeting afterwards
with Carl and some leaders,

53:13.126 --> 53:15.164
and even though they were
saying all the right things

53:15.164 --> 53:18.336
related to how things would
be different, and you know,

53:18.336 --> 53:20.608
"we'd look into all of this,"

53:20.608 --> 53:22.913
I just wasn't convinced at all.

53:22.913 --> 53:26.252
I remember distinctly
leaving the office thinking,

53:26.252 --> 53:28.658
it's not gonna have the
impact that we hoped for.

53:30.495 --> 53:31.964
- Within the year,

53:33.634 --> 53:36.707
I don't believe that there
were any of the five left

53:36.707 --> 53:37.642
at Hillsong NYC.

53:39.780 --> 53:42.652
(wind swooshing)

53:46.494 --> 53:51.537
- November, 2020, Brian
Houston kind of outta nowhere

53:52.639 --> 53:53.708
announces that he's
fired Carl Lentz.

53:53.708 --> 53:56.279
(uneasy music)

53:57.682 --> 54:00.187
- Carl was fired for
what were called,

54:00.187 --> 54:01.791
quote unquote, "moral failings."

54:03.895 --> 54:06.867
In the context of Hillsong,
moral failing has been used

54:06.867 --> 54:07.936
as a catchall for,

54:09.005 --> 54:10.274
I mean, I guess you
don't know really what,

54:10.274 --> 54:11.710
and that's sort of the point.

54:11.710 --> 54:14.382
But for any sort of
indiscretion that has led

54:14.382 --> 54:17.288
to some sort of ouster
from the church.

54:18.658 --> 54:21.730
- The next day, Carl has
a statement on Instagram

54:21.730 --> 54:23.801
about how he had been
untrue in his marriage

54:23.801 --> 54:26.674
and he had been leading
from this hollow place.

54:29.680 --> 54:32.552
- There were a few
days when Carl's firing

54:32.552 --> 54:37.228
was mostly mysterious, just
announced he was leaving

54:37.228 --> 54:38.831
and this photo,

54:38.831 --> 54:43.173
and then the detail
started coming very fast.

54:43.173 --> 54:45.778
(waves crashing)

54:52.859 --> 54:54.797
- [Reporter] The celebrity
megachurch sex scandal

54:54.797 --> 54:56.967
and his spectacular
fall from grace.

54:56.967 --> 54:58.604
- [Reporter] Had a relationship
outside of his marriage.

54:58.604 --> 55:00.608
- [Reporter] A woman who
said she had an affair

55:00.608 --> 55:02.378
with Hillsong Church
pastor Carl Lentz.

55:02.378 --> 55:05.050
- [Reporter] Ranin Karim
says, when she met Lentz

55:05.050 --> 55:06.787
five months ago, they began

55:06.787 --> 55:08.791
what she called a
consensual affair

55:08.791 --> 55:10.795
in spite of what she
thought were red flags,

55:10.795 --> 55:13.768
including him telling
her not to google him.

55:13.768 --> 55:16.272
- Ranin Karim, the woman Carl
was cheating on Laura with,

55:16.272 --> 55:20.113
started giving interviews
to multiple tabloids.

55:20.113 --> 55:23.086
- Like, there's something
wrong with your marriage

55:23.086 --> 55:24.388
that you sitting here with me?

55:24.388 --> 55:26.660
- Getting more and
more in depth about

55:26.660 --> 55:28.598
the amount of tequila that
was involved in their affair,

55:28.598 --> 55:30.400
the nicknames he would use.

55:30.400 --> 55:31.469
- [Interviewer] Did he
tell you he loved you?

55:31.469 --> 55:32.539
- Yes, he did.

55:32.539 --> 55:34.008
- How he would claim
to be a sports agent.

55:34.008 --> 55:35.612
- He didn't wanna
say what he does.

55:35.612 --> 55:37.749
- And it was just an onslaught.

55:37.749 --> 55:40.487
- [Person] I feel bad for her.
I never meant to hurt her.

55:40.487 --> 55:43.895
(tense emotional music)

55:48.203 --> 55:50.942
(traffic humming)

55:53.514 --> 55:55.552
- Carl's tenure as
pastor in New York

55:55.552 --> 55:57.121
was full of contradictions.

56:01.329 --> 56:04.368
He positioned himself as a
progressive voice on race.

56:05.270 --> 56:06.540
Later, Black congregants said

56:06.540 --> 56:08.578
that they didn't feel
heard within the church.

56:10.782 --> 56:13.654
He worked for a church that
preached purity culture,

56:13.654 --> 56:15.457
that banned premarital sex.

56:17.428 --> 56:19.833
Later, we found out that
he was having affairs.

56:23.206 --> 56:26.947
- We've read reports of pastors
who were sleeping around.

56:28.283 --> 56:31.991
You had pastors who were not
living what they were teaching.

56:35.330 --> 56:38.971
- After Carl was fired in
this spectacular public way,

56:38.971 --> 56:40.575
Hillsong commissioned
an investigation

56:40.575 --> 56:42.411
into its East Coast branches.

56:44.382 --> 56:49.191
In that investigation, there
was a claim by a junior staffer

56:49.191 --> 56:52.131
at the New York branch,
who said that Reed Bogard,

56:52.131 --> 56:54.903
who was one of the top pastors
at Hillsong, had raped her.

56:56.039 --> 56:58.276
- Reed Bogard, who's a
part of the foundation

56:58.276 --> 57:00.915
to Hillsong New York and
then again in Hillsong LA,

57:00.915 --> 57:04.656
and they have moved to Dallas,

57:04.656 --> 57:07.194
and are starting
Hillsong Dallas.

57:07.194 --> 57:08.731
(congregation cheers)

57:08.731 --> 57:10.467
- [Dan] A few months
after that investigation,

57:10.467 --> 57:12.338
Bogard resigned from
Hillsong Dallas.

57:12.338 --> 57:15.143
(unsettling music)

57:17.247 --> 57:18.450
- You know, the last 10 years

57:18.450 --> 57:20.555
of being in church planting mode

57:20.555 --> 57:24.061
has really taken a bit
of a toll on Jess and I

57:24.061 --> 57:26.900
and our family, and
we just really feel

57:26.900 --> 57:29.873
like it's time to
transition off of our staff

57:29.873 --> 57:34.215
and take some time to
remain healthy, get healthy,

57:34.215 --> 57:38.056
and to really see what this
next season holds for us.

57:41.195 --> 57:42.899
- [Dan] At the time
when he stepped down,

57:42.899 --> 57:45.938
he made no mention of any of
these allegations against him.

57:45.938 --> 57:47.909
Brian Houston also
made no mention

57:47.909 --> 57:50.280
of the allegations
against Bogard.

57:50.280 --> 57:52.986
He essentially said, "thank
you for your service."

57:52.986 --> 57:55.357
- Thank God for
Pastor Reed and Jess,

57:55.357 --> 57:58.798
and of course all of
our faithful volunteers
and team there.

57:58.798 --> 58:01.436
The devil's press strategies
are not gonna win.

58:01.436 --> 58:03.206
His weapons will not prosper.

58:03.206 --> 58:05.143
Bobbie and I are proud
of you and we love you,

58:05.143 --> 58:07.047
and we believe in
God's best for you.

58:12.091 --> 58:15.565
- A lot like Carl, Reed had
been handpicked by Brian.

58:18.036 --> 58:20.307
When you see it
over and over again,

58:20.307 --> 58:22.579
it's not just Carl and
it's not just Reed Bogard.

58:22.579 --> 58:24.516
It's like the person at the top.

58:24.516 --> 58:26.185
Like you have to
look at that person.

58:26.185 --> 58:28.791
(eerie music)

58:35.270 --> 58:37.842
Brian even says it, you
catch the culture in Sydney,

58:37.842 --> 58:40.581
you go to Sydney, you
go to Hillsong College,

58:40.581 --> 58:42.952
and you are
indoctrinated into this,

58:42.952 --> 58:47.996
the system of, you know,
violation, abuse and coverup.

58:48.798 --> 58:50.935
It's just how the place works.

58:51.704 --> 58:55.210
(eerie music continues)

59:03.894 --> 59:06.199
(Carl speaks indistinctly)

59:06.199 --> 59:08.738
- [Dan] There was an
entrenched cultural narrative

59:08.738 --> 59:12.344
around Hillsong that was
really hard to pierce.

59:12.344 --> 59:14.883
I don't think it was until
that was sort of punctured

59:14.883 --> 59:17.689
by Carl cheating that there
was really an opportunity

59:17.689 --> 59:19.391
to look what was
actually happening

59:19.391 --> 59:21.229
in the church on a
day-to-day basis.

59:23.366 --> 59:24.636
- [Alex] Carl was problematic,

59:24.636 --> 59:26.205
but there was also
a concerted effort

59:26.205 --> 59:29.011
to paint him as
the one bad apple,

59:29.011 --> 59:32.017
the problem at the root of
all of Hillsong's problems.

59:33.386 --> 59:36.627
The final nail in the coffin
was Brian on the "Today Show."

59:36.627 --> 59:38.697
- Carl was Carl. He's
unique character.

59:38.697 --> 59:41.269
There's a lot of things
I miss about Carl,

59:41.269 --> 59:43.941
but having said that, there
were leadership issues

59:43.941 --> 59:45.410
it included lying,

59:45.410 --> 59:49.151
included what I would call
narcissistic behavior.

59:49.151 --> 59:52.959
In my mind, if one
person is treated badly,

59:52.959 --> 59:54.295
that's one too many.

59:55.598 --> 59:58.737
I don't think Carl really
is anything like me.

59:58.737 --> 01:00:02.211
(gentle uneasy music)

01:00:06.085 --> 01:00:07.922
- [Alex] My job initially
was to write about

01:00:07.922 --> 01:00:11.462
what was gonna happen with
this mega superstar pastor.

01:00:11.462 --> 01:00:13.634
- He was like, he is good.
He was good yesterday.

01:00:13.634 --> 01:00:16.105
He's good now. He's
gonna be good tomorrow.

01:00:17.174 --> 01:00:19.245
- [Alex] And then
Carl just disappeared.

01:00:22.585 --> 01:00:24.789
One minute Carl was everywhere.

01:00:24.789 --> 01:00:26.125
The next, he was gone.

01:00:29.365 --> 01:00:31.970
- [Katelyn] We reached out
and have no comment from Carl,

01:00:31.970 --> 01:00:34.509
Laura and Hillsong Church.

01:00:34.509 --> 01:00:37.181
(uneasy music)

01:00:45.798 --> 01:00:49.271
(uneasy music continues)

01:00:57.689 --> 01:01:00.561
(uneasy music continues)

01:01:00.561 --> 01:01:02.264
- [Crew Member] This is Carl
Lentz interview, take one.

01:01:02.264 --> 01:01:03.667
ABV common mark.

01:01:03.667 --> 01:01:06.807
(board claps)

01:01:06.807 --> 01:01:08.811
- [Crew Member] Cool.
Whenever you're ready.

01:01:19.098 --> 01:01:21.503
So whenever you're ready,
Carl, just introduce yourself,

01:01:21.503 --> 01:01:23.006
your connection to Hillsong

01:01:23.006 --> 01:01:25.310
and why you're sitting
in the interview today.

01:01:25.310 --> 01:01:26.245
- Yeah.

01:01:28.049 --> 01:01:31.155
(soft airy music)

01:01:40.440 --> 01:01:43.046
I really don't wanna
mess up my TV makeup,

01:01:43.046 --> 01:01:43.914
ah, at all.

01:01:43.914 --> 01:01:44.616
- [Interviewer] Right here.

01:01:44.616 --> 01:01:45.718
- Okay. Yeah.

01:01:50.528 --> 01:01:52.464
Okay. (exhales)

01:01:52.464 --> 01:01:53.433
Sorry. Let's just-

01:01:54.603 --> 01:01:55.638
- [Crew Member] Take a breath.

01:01:55.638 --> 01:01:56.339
- I'm good, yeah.

01:02:02.017 --> 01:02:06.893
I'm so nervous about how
this is gonna be portrayed,

01:02:06.893 --> 01:02:08.162
but I cannot control that.

01:02:08.162 --> 01:02:12.070
So God, grant me the serenity

01:02:12.070 --> 01:02:15.043
to accept the documentary
things I cannot change

01:02:16.379 --> 01:02:19.385
and the courage to change
the things that I can,

01:02:19.385 --> 01:02:21.322
and the wisdom to
know the difference.

01:02:27.367 --> 01:02:29.973
You do not want to
be in this chair.

01:02:30.775 --> 01:02:32.845
I cannot stress it enough.

01:02:32.845 --> 01:02:35.918
(soft serene music)

01:02:44.903 --> 01:02:47.207
(no audio)

01:02:50.915 --> 01:02:54.054
(light upbeat music)

01:02:55.858 --> 01:02:57.094
If you believe right,
you will stay right.

01:02:57.094 --> 01:02:59.933
If you stay right,
you will walk right.

01:03:05.511 --> 01:03:07.548
Put your hand up,
rededicate your life to him.

01:03:07.548 --> 01:03:08.416
Christians, praise.

01:03:11.422 --> 01:03:14.128
Anybody else and you are
disconnected from God,

01:03:14.128 --> 01:03:15.330
and you are sick of it.

01:03:16.533 --> 01:03:20.273
(light upbeat music continues)

01:03:23.814 --> 01:03:26.720
(clicks popping)

01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:29.893
(bright music)

01:03:29.893 --> 01:03:32.397
(airy music)
