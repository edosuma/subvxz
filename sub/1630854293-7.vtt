00:01.914 --> 00:03.568
<i>Previously on</i> S.W.A.T....HICKS: <i>Sanchez comes to us</i>

00:03.568 --> 00:05.701
<i>with the commission's
full seal of approval.</i>

00:05.701 --> 00:07.050
When the bosses
heard that you were

00:07.050 --> 00:08.312
returning to SWAT,
they came up with a plan.

00:08.312 --> 00:10.053
They sent Sanchez
to get you to quit.

00:10.053 --> 00:11.881
<i>It's his one and only job there.</i>

00:11.881 --> 00:13.230
I know about your orders
with the commission.

00:13.230 --> 00:15.363
All it's gonna take
is one minor screwup

00:15.363 --> 00:17.104
to give the commission what
it wants to send you packing.

00:17.104 --> 00:18.714
You can keep sidelining
me on missions.

00:18.714 --> 00:20.368
I'm not going anywhere.

00:20.368 --> 00:22.065
I'm gonna ask Bonnie
to marry me.

00:22.065 --> 00:23.719
Mom, this is Bonnie.
And Bonnie, this is my mom Fay.

00:23.719 --> 00:25.895
I brought an offering
for the altar.

00:25.895 --> 00:28.332
You're very kind
to honor our traditions.

00:28.332 --> 00:29.899
We've got a lifetime
to learn about each other's

00:29.899 --> 00:31.074
culture and traditions.

00:31.074 --> 00:32.858
What can you find out about me

00:32.858 --> 00:34.469
in the bedroom
that you can't out here?

00:34.469 --> 00:36.123
- You'll see.
- Okay.

00:36.123 --> 00:37.124
Kelly, you start
this fall.

00:37.124 --> 00:38.864
- No way!
- Yes, way.

00:38.864 --> 00:41.171
Luca's support means
everything to her.

00:41.171 --> 00:43.086
I got a text from your mom today
asking me on a date.

00:43.086 --> 00:45.001
I didn't send Luca that text.

00:45.001 --> 00:46.655
He should be
a part of our family.

00:46.655 --> 00:48.265
He is like family.

00:48.265 --> 00:51.268
I promise you, I will
always be there for you.

01:28.479 --> 01:31.961
♪ Buy my mom that crib
with the nice pool ♪

01:31.961 --> 01:34.877
♪ Get my sis that Jeep,
and tonight we gon' eat... ♪

02:21.706 --> 02:23.534
Okay, we gonna run
these lines or what?

02:23.534 --> 02:25.580
Otherwise, I'm gonna
be late for work

02:25.580 --> 02:27.538
and you are gonna
be late for school.

02:27.538 --> 02:28.844
Here.

02:31.803 --> 02:33.370
What's up?

02:33.370 --> 02:34.676
Don't tell me you're nervous
about the audition, man.

02:34.676 --> 02:36.025
You're a pro at this.

02:36.025 --> 02:39.333
No. I'm not auditioning.
There's no point.

02:39.333 --> 02:41.161
Aw, you said the same thing
last time, you got a part.

02:41.161 --> 02:43.206
This time, you're gonna
land one of the leads.

02:43.206 --> 02:45.208
Okay, I'll play Peter.
You ready?

02:45.208 --> 02:46.818
"Tinker Bell.
Tink, you there?"

02:46.818 --> 02:48.994
We're moving to San Diego.

02:48.994 --> 02:50.909
You're what?

02:50.909 --> 02:52.694
My mom just told me last night.

02:52.694 --> 02:54.348
We're leaving
in a couple of weeks.

02:54.348 --> 02:55.827
- She got a job there.
- You can't leave,
it's the middle

02:55.827 --> 02:57.699
of the school year.
And what about the play?

02:57.699 --> 03:00.180
And you've got this
- audition coming up.
- My mom doesn't care.

03:00.180 --> 03:02.225
I don't want to go.

03:02.225 --> 03:03.705
Did you tell her that?

03:03.705 --> 03:06.011
Yeah, but she says
it's not my decision.

03:06.011 --> 03:07.317
She says that
we're gonna have a house

03:07.317 --> 03:09.493
with a yard,
and a dog,

03:09.493 --> 03:10.973
but I don't
want a dog,

03:10.973 --> 03:12.496
and I don't want to
go to a new school.

03:12.496 --> 03:13.932
I want to stay here.

03:13.932 --> 03:16.108
It's not fair.

03:17.762 --> 03:20.243
Will you talk to my mom?

03:20.243 --> 03:22.637
Tell her it's a stupid idea.

03:23.638 --> 03:25.074
I don't know.

03:25.074 --> 03:26.684
I mean, I'm not sure
she'll listen to me.

03:26.684 --> 03:28.599
Please?

03:32.168 --> 03:34.301
Okay. Sure.

03:34.301 --> 03:35.911
I'll talk to her.

03:35.911 --> 03:38.261
Okay, come on, then.

03:38.261 --> 03:40.829
Let's practice.

03:40.829 --> 03:42.613
Okay. "Tinker Bell.

03:42.613 --> 03:44.398
Tink, you there?"

04:02.329 --> 04:03.765
She's been working in Atlanta.

04:03.765 --> 04:06.202
It's her first weekend back
in two months.

04:06.202 --> 04:07.421
It's also the anniversary
of our first date.

04:07.421 --> 04:08.465
I want to make it special,

04:08.465 --> 04:09.510
pull out all the stops.

04:09.510 --> 04:11.512
She already said "I do."

04:11.512 --> 04:12.861
Why do you need
to try so hard?

04:12.861 --> 04:14.254
Because I love her
and I miss her.

04:14.254 --> 04:15.733
And my track record is poor.

04:15.733 --> 04:17.648
What, forget last year?

04:17.648 --> 04:19.215
No, I didn't, all right?

04:19.215 --> 04:20.434
I got her front row tickets
to <i>Hamilton.</i>

04:20.434 --> 04:22.784
How's that bad?
Does she hate

04:22.784 --> 04:23.785
the Founding Fathers
or something?

04:23.785 --> 04:25.308
No, she hates musicals.

04:25.308 --> 04:27.092
I just didn't know that
until intermission.

04:27.092 --> 04:28.877
Turns out she would
have had more fun

04:28.877 --> 04:30.487
listening to first graders
playing a violin concerto.

04:30.487 --> 04:33.011
Deac, you've been
married forever.

04:33.011 --> 04:34.926
Got any
anniversary ideas?

04:35.927 --> 04:37.320
Every year,
Annie and I go to the place

04:37.320 --> 04:38.974
where we had our first date.

04:38.974 --> 04:40.802
It's this little Italian spot
called Marcello's.

04:40.802 --> 04:42.717
Nothing fancy,
but special to us.

04:42.717 --> 04:44.240
Why don't you
just take Bonnie

04:44.240 --> 04:46.024
to the place you guys
had your first date?

04:46.024 --> 04:47.765
Uh, it was this
annoying hipster café,

04:47.765 --> 04:49.550
charged eight bucks
for an Americano

04:49.550 --> 04:50.594
that was served
in what looked like

04:50.594 --> 04:51.769
a high school chemistry set.

04:51.769 --> 04:54.381
Vowed we'd never go back.
Come on.

04:54.381 --> 04:56.034
You're a woman. Help a dude out.

04:56.034 --> 04:57.340
What-what do I get her?

04:57.340 --> 04:59.081
Even if that wasn't
a little sexist,

04:59.081 --> 05:01.170
I would not be
the right person to ask.

05:01.170 --> 05:03.346
I don't do romance.

05:03.346 --> 05:05.609
Why not?
What's wrong with romance?

05:05.609 --> 05:08.177
I, uh, married
my high school sweetheart.

05:08.177 --> 05:10.266
He proposed to me
with a flash mob orchestra

05:10.266 --> 05:12.137
and fireworks, cheated on me

05:12.137 --> 05:14.270
with one of my bridesmaids.
I divorced him.

05:14.270 --> 05:16.011
He got the TV and the dog.

05:23.279 --> 05:25.237
You'll figure something out.

06:34.568 --> 06:36.047
911, what's your emergency?

06:36.047 --> 06:37.962
Help, I need help.

06:37.962 --> 06:40.008
There's a man in my house.
He-he's trying to kill me.

07:46.117 --> 07:47.423
Roger that.

07:47.423 --> 07:48.424
Dispatch isn't
getting any response

07:48.424 --> 07:49.556
from the initial 911 call.

07:49.556 --> 07:51.209
They did get
another call, though.

07:51.209 --> 07:52.689
Reported gunfire.
Where do you want us?

07:52.689 --> 07:54.430
I want to do
everything we can

07:54.430 --> 07:55.910
to avoid a hostage or
a barricade situation.

07:55.910 --> 07:57.520
The best you can do
is shut down this street,

07:57.520 --> 07:59.043
set a perimeter.
We'll play it from here.

07:59.043 --> 08:00.523
Roger that.

08:01.524 --> 08:02.786
All right, listen up.
We got no idea

08:02.786 --> 08:04.222
if there's wounded inside,

08:04.222 --> 08:05.920
so we got to make
entry and find out.

08:05.920 --> 08:07.530
Street, you and I
got the three side.

08:07.530 --> 08:08.836
Deacon and the rest
of you got the one.

08:08.836 --> 08:10.315
Suspect could
still be on site.

08:10.315 --> 08:12.274
Copy that. So stay liquid.

08:28.638 --> 08:30.031
30-David. Front door's ajar.

08:30.031 --> 08:31.119
No sign of any suspects.

08:31.119 --> 08:33.469
Don't wait on us, Deac.

08:33.469 --> 08:34.905
Could be people
injured inside. Go.

08:34.905 --> 08:35.906
Roger that.

08:35.906 --> 08:37.604
Making entry now.

08:54.621 --> 08:56.536
Got a body.

09:06.937 --> 09:08.243
One female victim.

09:08.243 --> 09:10.027
Housekeeper, maybe. Deceased.

09:10.027 --> 09:11.899
Copy that.
Any sign of the suspect?

09:11.899 --> 09:13.901
Negative. Moving on.

09:19.384 --> 09:20.560
20-David, checking
possible movement

09:20.560 --> 09:21.561
on the four side.

09:21.561 --> 09:24.085
Street, go right.

09:32.006 --> 09:33.703
Deac.

09:33.703 --> 09:35.444
Los Angeles
Police Department.

09:35.444 --> 09:37.620
You can come out now.
You're safe.

09:41.972 --> 09:43.495
You okay? You hurt?

09:43.495 --> 09:45.628
No, I'm okay.

09:45.628 --> 09:48.457
30-David.
One female found alive.

09:48.457 --> 09:50.198
No injuries. Move.

09:55.203 --> 09:57.771
28-David. Downstairs is clear.

09:57.771 --> 09:59.337
No sign of the suspect.

09:59.337 --> 10:01.165
Whoever was here,
looks like they're gone.

10:05.996 --> 10:07.084
Stop right there!

10:10.174 --> 10:11.567
LAPD!

10:11.567 --> 10:13.525
Hondo, you enjoying this
or something?

10:13.525 --> 10:15.615
Get off of me already.

10:17.181 --> 10:18.269
Sanchez?

10:18.269 --> 10:19.967
You want to
explain to me

10:19.967 --> 10:21.577
what the hell
you're doing here before

10:21.577 --> 10:22.883
I arrest your ass?

10:22.883 --> 10:24.667
Arrest me for what?
Doing my job?

10:24.667 --> 10:26.364
I was here for a meeting.

10:26.364 --> 10:28.932
Arrived, saw a man
with a gun in the driveway.

10:28.932 --> 10:30.281
He fired at me and
then took off running,

10:30.281 --> 10:31.979
so I called it in
and went after him.

10:31.979 --> 10:33.850
You should have
waited for backup.

10:33.850 --> 10:35.678
Why? I had him
pinned down back here

10:35.678 --> 10:38.072
until you boys in blue showed up
and he made a break for it.

10:38.072 --> 10:40.640
Hopped the fence.
I almost had him,

10:40.640 --> 10:42.163
but thanks to you,
he's now in the wind.

10:42.163 --> 10:44.687
Oh, is that so?
Because from where I'm standing,

10:44.687 --> 10:46.602
the only reason we got a killer
on the loose is because of you.

10:46.602 --> 10:48.517
Street, let's go.

10:48.517 --> 10:50.998
These boys in blue
got a job to do.

11:34.694 --> 11:36.260
<i>Hey, get a load of this.</i>

11:36.260 --> 11:38.132
Thought when
Sanchez left SWAT,

11:38.132 --> 11:39.611
we'd seen
the last of him.

11:39.611 --> 11:40.395
What are the chances of
running into him like this?

11:40.395 --> 11:41.613
He used to be on SWAT?

11:41.613 --> 11:42.832
Yeah, he was
team leader

11:42.832 --> 11:44.747
when Hondo was
away in Mexico.

11:44.747 --> 11:46.618
Then, when Hondo got back,
Sanchez tried

11:46.618 --> 11:47.707
to run him off the team
and out of SWAT.

11:47.707 --> 11:49.317
But obviously it didn't work out

11:49.317 --> 11:51.536
because Sanchez is the one
who ended up leaving.

11:51.536 --> 11:53.016
Yeah, well, we might
have given him

11:53.016 --> 11:54.452
a little nudge
out the door.

11:54.452 --> 11:55.932
Deac set him up with
a job as head of security

11:55.932 --> 11:57.586
for one of
the big studios.

11:57.586 --> 11:59.283
That's how come he's here.
That's Serena Mendez.

11:59.283 --> 12:01.329
She's starring in
the studio's latest movie.

12:01.329 --> 12:03.200
It's out next week.

12:03.200 --> 12:04.767
She's done a couple things,
but this is her first big role.

12:04.767 --> 12:05.899
There's even been awards buzz.

12:05.899 --> 12:08.031
I did not take you

12:08.031 --> 12:09.380
to be such
a pop culture nerd, Tan.

12:09.380 --> 12:10.991
How do you know all this?

12:10.991 --> 12:13.341
Uh, Ben what's-his-face
is in the movie

12:13.341 --> 12:15.952
and Bonnie loves him, maybe
even more than she loves me.

12:15.952 --> 12:19.913
Serena saves the world
from a zombie apocalypse.

12:19.913 --> 12:22.480
I wonder why someone
wants her dead.

12:22.480 --> 12:23.612
Give me a minute?

12:23.612 --> 12:24.961
Yes, of course.

12:27.616 --> 12:29.313
I know this is hard, Serena.

12:29.313 --> 12:31.185
Anything you can give us
to help catch this guy?

12:31.185 --> 12:33.796
Did you get a look at him?
Recognize his voice, maybe?

12:33.796 --> 12:36.538
No, but he's got to be
one of my stalkers.

12:36.538 --> 12:38.453
Stalkers?

12:38.453 --> 12:41.412
Yeah, I've been getting
death threats lately.

12:42.500 --> 12:45.286
Would you mind
giving us a second, please?

12:45.286 --> 12:46.809
Yeah, why don't
you go inside?

12:46.809 --> 12:48.245
I'll come and get you
- in a minute.
- Okay.

12:52.989 --> 12:54.338
Start talking.

12:54.338 --> 12:56.514
All right, listen,
the death threats

12:56.514 --> 12:58.778
Serena's talking about
are from an 82-year-old woman

12:58.778 --> 13:01.215
who thinks because Serena played
an alien in her last movie,

13:01.215 --> 13:02.520
she actually is one.

13:02.520 --> 13:05.045
Hondo, I look
into every threat

13:05.045 --> 13:07.569
the studio or its
employees receives.

13:07.569 --> 13:09.963
I do my job,
and I do it well.

13:09.963 --> 13:12.008
Okay, and what
about these stalkers?

13:12.008 --> 13:14.663
Teenage fanboys with
raging hormones

13:14.663 --> 13:15.882
and the communication
skills of a generation

13:15.882 --> 13:17.231
raised by TikTok.

13:17.231 --> 13:19.581
That gunman was
not a teenager,

13:19.581 --> 13:21.322
or someone's
crazy-ass grandma.

13:21.322 --> 13:24.281
He moved and shot like someone
with military training.

13:24.281 --> 13:26.066
And he killed the maid
with a hammer.

13:26.066 --> 13:28.372
That's not a military-style hit.
That feels personal.

13:28.372 --> 13:29.591
Unis noticed
a suspicious vehicle

13:29.591 --> 13:31.636
parked opposite the house.

13:31.636 --> 13:33.160
Doesn't belong to any
of the neighbors.

13:33.160 --> 13:34.552
Yeah, I bet you
it's the suspect's.

13:34.552 --> 13:35.466
He was heading that way
when I rolled up

13:35.466 --> 13:36.511
and sent him running.

13:36.511 --> 13:37.860
Could give us a lead.

13:37.860 --> 13:39.166
Already ran the plate.
It's a rental.

13:39.166 --> 13:40.558
RHD's chasing it down.

13:40.558 --> 13:42.430
All right,
keep me posted. Okay.

13:42.430 --> 13:43.823
We're gonna need to see

13:43.823 --> 13:45.389
everything you got
on those stalkers.

13:45.389 --> 13:47.435
Hondo, I told you,
I already looked into them.

13:47.435 --> 13:48.915
You would be wasting your time.

13:48.915 --> 13:51.569
Yeah, well, I like to do
my job properly, Sanchez.

13:51.569 --> 13:53.528
Fine.

13:53.528 --> 13:56.139
I'll get the file
and bring it to HQ.

14:02.450 --> 14:03.799
Oh, God.

14:03.799 --> 14:06.323
I need to take this.
I'll catch up with you.

14:06.323 --> 14:08.238
So, Hicks is tied up
with Rocker's team

14:08.238 --> 14:09.761
at a hostage
situation downtown,

14:09.761 --> 14:11.285
but he wanted to pass
along the message

14:11.285 --> 14:12.460
the brass wants us

14:12.460 --> 14:14.027
to stick with
the Serena case.

14:14.027 --> 14:15.506
Apparently,
they're worried

14:15.506 --> 14:17.073
that the LAPD
will look bad

14:17.073 --> 14:18.422
if we don't get
the killer in custody

14:18.422 --> 14:19.423
before the media
gets the story.

14:19.423 --> 14:21.512
LAPD look bad?

14:21.512 --> 14:22.905
Nah, it seems to me

14:22.905 --> 14:24.385
that Sanchez is the one
who dropped the ball.

14:24.385 --> 14:25.647
Serena was getting threats

14:25.647 --> 14:26.735
and he didn't look
into it properly.

14:26.735 --> 14:28.084
A woman is dead because of it.

14:28.084 --> 14:29.607
He's just lucky
it wasn't two women.

14:29.607 --> 14:31.435
Hey, look, I'm no fan
of Sanchez, either,

14:31.435 --> 14:33.046
but he said he looked
into the threats.

14:33.046 --> 14:35.222
Got to believe
that he did his job.

14:35.222 --> 14:37.528
Is-is there a chance
it's not a stalker?

14:37.528 --> 14:39.269
Maybe it was
a burglary gone wrong.

14:39.269 --> 14:40.705
Deac, if it was
a burglary,

14:40.705 --> 14:42.490
they would've stolen
the $300,000 car

14:42.490 --> 14:44.013
sitting in the driveway.

14:44.013 --> 14:45.885
The keys were right there
on the hallway table.

14:45.885 --> 14:47.887
Now, Serena said he was
searching the house for her.

14:47.887 --> 14:49.889
Oh, RHD
ran a check

14:49.889 --> 14:51.586
on that car
we found outside.

14:51.586 --> 14:53.588
It was rented with a fake ID,
so that's a dead end.

14:53.588 --> 14:55.155
And the gunman
wore gloves,

14:55.155 --> 14:56.983
so they weren't able
to pull any useful prints.

14:56.983 --> 14:58.680
All right, Street and Luca are
combing through the stalker file

14:58.680 --> 15:00.073
that Sanchez brought in.
That should give us something.

15:00.073 --> 15:02.075
Yeah, my buddies at SWAT
are working on it.

15:02.075 --> 15:04.077
Now, we'll find the guy,
I promise.

15:04.077 --> 15:06.209
Serena's fine,
not a scratch on her.

15:06.209 --> 15:08.995
I left one of the guys from my
team with her just to be safe.

15:08.995 --> 15:11.736
Wanted to personally oversee
this police investigation.

15:11.736 --> 15:12.868
Okay. Yes, sir.

15:14.043 --> 15:15.740
Boss. He's anxious.

15:15.740 --> 15:17.873
Can't let anything happen
to our lead actress.

15:17.873 --> 15:19.570
So where we at?

15:19.570 --> 15:20.789
Made any progress?

15:22.791 --> 15:24.053
Don't want to hand it
to Sanchez,

15:24.053 --> 15:25.533
but it seems
like he did

15:25.533 --> 15:26.795
his due diligence.
None of these stalkers

15:26.795 --> 15:28.231
are checking out
as legit threats.

15:28.231 --> 15:29.798
Yeah. Maybe we should
take another look

15:29.798 --> 15:31.669
at Serena's
social media,

15:31.669 --> 15:32.714
see if anything
got missed.

15:32.714 --> 15:33.889
I'll run a search.

15:35.195 --> 15:37.980
Hey, uh, you talk to
Tuana about her and Kelly

15:37.980 --> 15:39.503
- moving to San Diego?
- No, not yet.

15:39.503 --> 15:40.852
I'm not sure how
to handle it.

15:40.852 --> 15:42.506
Look, I don't know
why she couldn't

15:42.506 --> 15:43.899
apply for a job in L.A.

15:43.899 --> 15:45.205
Well, I mean,
it might be more money

15:45.205 --> 15:46.641
or a better position.

15:46.641 --> 15:48.730
And it's only two hours away.

15:48.730 --> 15:51.385
I know you're gonna miss Kelly,
but you'll still see her.

15:51.385 --> 15:52.777
Look, it's not that,
I just don't think

15:52.777 --> 15:54.040
Tuana's thought this through.

15:54.040 --> 15:56.216
I mean, do you know
how hard it was

15:56.216 --> 15:57.565
to get Kelly
into that school?

15:57.565 --> 15:59.001
And she's doing great.
She's made friends,

15:59.001 --> 16:01.177
she was gonna audition
for the school play.

16:01.177 --> 16:03.092
Yeah. Now, I'm sure Tuana
weighed all that in.

16:03.092 --> 16:05.616
Look, it might be tough
at first,

16:05.616 --> 16:07.488
but Kelly's gonna be fine, dude.

16:07.488 --> 16:09.359
It's not like she's bouncing
from foster home to foster home.

16:09.359 --> 16:11.274
Sure, but if you ask me,

16:11.274 --> 16:14.060
Tuana's still making
a huge mistake.

16:14.060 --> 16:15.583
This is a big change for Kelly.

16:15.583 --> 16:17.977
And who says change
is always for the best?

16:17.977 --> 16:20.501
Ah, that's what this
is about. Change.

16:20.501 --> 16:21.981
You hate change.

16:21.981 --> 16:24.244
What are you talking about?
That's not true.

16:24.244 --> 16:26.507
Luca, you've been eating
the same banh mi sandwich

16:26.507 --> 16:28.509
every Sunday
from the same place,

16:28.509 --> 16:30.424
after surfing the same break
you've been surfing

16:30.424 --> 16:31.599
for 20 years.28 years.

16:31.599 --> 16:34.123
Yeah, and you freaked out

16:34.123 --> 16:35.995
when I moved the toaster oven

16:35.995 --> 16:37.213
to make way for the blender.

16:37.213 --> 16:38.736
You made me
move it back.

16:38.736 --> 16:41.478
You hate change,
and I'm just saying,

16:41.478 --> 16:42.827
maybe that's what's coloring

16:42.827 --> 16:44.568
your reaction
to-to Kelly leaving.

16:44.568 --> 16:46.353
But the blender was better

16:46.353 --> 16:47.876
on the other side
of the kitchen.

16:47.876 --> 16:50.357
It makes more sense if
it's next to the fridge.

16:50.357 --> 16:51.488
Next time you're
making a smoothie,

16:51.488 --> 16:53.795
think about how right I am.

16:53.795 --> 16:55.449
What's happening with
that stalker list?

16:55.449 --> 16:57.146
You get
- anything from it?
- No, nothing so far.

16:57.146 --> 16:59.453
Told you. You're barking up
the wrong tree.

16:59.453 --> 17:01.020
Hold up.
Think I might've

17:01.020 --> 17:02.238
finally barked up
the right tree.

17:02.238 --> 17:04.110
I ran searches
on social media

17:04.110 --> 17:05.807
with Serena's name
as the hashtag

17:05.807 --> 17:07.983
to see if anyone's posted
anything threatening.

17:07.983 --> 17:09.115
Got a hit.

17:09.115 --> 17:11.160
Leo Smith.

17:11.160 --> 17:13.641
He was never on my radar.

17:13.641 --> 17:16.122
I can't police
the entire Internet.

17:16.122 --> 17:17.427
He's been tagging Serena
in all his posts,

17:17.427 --> 17:19.342
claiming to be a director,

17:19.342 --> 17:22.128
begging her to star
in his next movie.

17:22.128 --> 17:24.260
She didn't respond, so now his
opinion of her has changed.

17:24.260 --> 17:27.481
He's calling her a talentless
fill-in-the-blank

17:27.481 --> 17:28.873
that deserves
to die.

17:28.873 --> 17:30.092
You got eyes on
the suspect earlier.

17:30.092 --> 17:31.354
This him?

17:31.354 --> 17:32.573
I don't know,
I only caught a glimpse

17:32.573 --> 17:34.662
when he took off running.
Could be.

17:34.662 --> 17:36.316
He was in the army,

17:36.316 --> 17:37.926
and his ex put
a restraining order on him

17:37.926 --> 17:40.363
after he threatened to
kill her and their kid.

17:40.363 --> 17:41.495
Lives in Reseda now.

17:41.495 --> 17:42.844
Let's pay Leo a visit.

17:42.844 --> 17:43.932
Street, you're with me.

17:43.932 --> 17:45.281
- Luca, keep digging.
- Okay.

17:45.281 --> 17:46.500
Hey, hey, Sanchez?

17:46.500 --> 17:47.849
Where you going?

17:47.849 --> 17:49.111
Uh, with you.

17:49.111 --> 17:50.678
Last I checked,
you ain't SWAT.

17:50.678 --> 17:52.636
You're a civilian.

17:54.073 --> 17:55.857
Come on, Street, let's go.

18:00.035 --> 18:01.732
Hey, you rolling
with, uh, Hondo and Street?

18:01.732 --> 18:03.082
Yeah, you coming with?

18:03.082 --> 18:04.561
No, Hondo wants me
to keep looking

18:04.561 --> 18:06.781
for other suspects in case
Leo doesn't pan out.

18:06.781 --> 18:08.826
You still trying to think
up an anniversary gift?

18:08.826 --> 18:10.698
Yeah. I mean,
I got plenty of ideas,

18:10.698 --> 18:12.439
but they all seem
to start with flowers

18:12.439 --> 18:13.875
and end with
a candlelit dinner.

18:13.875 --> 18:14.876
You got any ideas
that are more original?

18:14.876 --> 18:16.138
Not really.

18:16.138 --> 18:17.574
I mean, I did date
this woman once,

18:17.574 --> 18:19.141
Dana, and on
our six-week anniversary...

18:19.141 --> 18:20.621
Wait, wait.

18:20.621 --> 18:22.101
Who celebrates their
six-week anniversary?

18:22.101 --> 18:24.146
Dana. Anyways,
I come home from surfing,

18:24.146 --> 18:25.843
there's candles
on the table.

18:25.843 --> 18:28.150
She's in this red dress,
with these high heels.

18:28.150 --> 18:29.934
I mean, she looks like
Kim Basinger back in the day.

18:29.934 --> 18:33.155
She's got steaks searing
in the pan, beers on ice,

18:33.155 --> 18:35.592
and she asks me,
"Where's my gift?"

18:35.592 --> 18:38.117
And all I had on me
was my surfboard, right?

18:38.117 --> 18:40.771
But it was beautiful.
It was a nine-foot.

18:40.771 --> 18:43.339
Handcrafted from
paulownia timber.

18:44.384 --> 18:46.299
I had no choice.
I had to pretend it was for her.

18:46.299 --> 18:48.866
Bonnie hates surfing, dude.

18:48.866 --> 18:50.477
That's not the point.

18:50.477 --> 18:52.348
Anyway, Dana broke up with me
three weeks later

18:52.348 --> 18:54.350
after I forgot our
nine-week anniversary.

18:54.350 --> 18:56.483
What am I supposed to get
from this story, Luca?

18:56.483 --> 18:57.875
I'm just trying to help, dude.

18:58.876 --> 19:00.269
Man, I really miss that board.

19:04.621 --> 19:06.580
LAPD SWAT. Open up.

19:06.580 --> 19:08.147
What the...

19:11.324 --> 19:13.064
Leo Smith?
Yeah.

19:13.064 --> 19:14.675
What's g...
What's going on?

19:14.675 --> 19:16.242
You mind if we come in?

19:16.242 --> 19:17.634
Uh...

19:17.634 --> 19:18.940
Okay.

19:23.858 --> 19:25.599
Just keep your hands
where we can see them.

19:27.253 --> 19:29.124
Bathroom's clear.

19:29.124 --> 19:31.039
Where were you this morning

19:31.039 --> 19:32.693
between 8:00
and 9:00 a.m.?
Here.

19:32.693 --> 19:35.086
You got someone
who can confirm that story?

19:35.086 --> 19:36.305
Hey, Hondo. Over here.

19:37.176 --> 19:38.264
I got something.

19:42.572 --> 19:43.921
Back it up a bit.

19:45.227 --> 19:47.186
They're all
of Serena.

19:47.186 --> 19:48.665
Got a little crush, huh?

19:48.665 --> 19:50.276
It's n-not
what it looks like.

19:50.276 --> 19:51.973
I... was just trying
to make some money

19:51.973 --> 19:53.366
on the side,
selling shots of stars.

19:53.366 --> 19:55.455
Oh, you're a paparazzo,
not a pervert.

19:55.455 --> 19:57.587
But I got an alibi
for this morning.

19:57.587 --> 19:59.328
I was chatting
with someone online.

19:59.328 --> 20:00.590
Only just went to bed.

20:01.722 --> 20:03.332
I'll show you.

20:03.332 --> 20:05.247
Go ahead.

20:11.732 --> 20:13.299
He's not our guy.

20:20.480 --> 20:22.569
Oh...

20:22.569 --> 20:25.136
So, the suspect didn't
check out, then, huh?

20:25.136 --> 20:26.964
He has an alibi,

20:26.964 --> 20:28.401
but he was stalking you.

20:28.401 --> 20:29.793
We found evidence,

20:29.793 --> 20:31.839
as well as a couple
unlicensed guns.

20:31.839 --> 20:34.145
He's been charged, so I doubt
he'll be bothering you again.

20:34.145 --> 20:35.669
But whoever broke into my house

20:35.669 --> 20:37.366
and killed Marie
is still out there.

20:37.366 --> 20:38.802
And you haven't
caught him yet?

20:38.802 --> 20:40.935
No. No, not yet.
But that's why we're here.

20:40.935 --> 20:42.719
We think you should
come back to HQ with us.

20:42.719 --> 20:44.155
It'll be safer
until we catch this guy.

20:44.155 --> 20:46.027
Uh, no need for that.

20:46.027 --> 20:47.333
I'm in charge
of her security.

20:47.333 --> 20:49.030
I got it covered.

20:49.030 --> 20:50.553
Maybe it's not a bad idea
for you to go with them.

20:50.553 --> 20:52.207
And you are?

20:52.207 --> 20:54.688
I'm Cody. Serena's boyfriend.

20:54.688 --> 20:56.255
You live here, too?

20:56.255 --> 20:58.431
No. Uh, but I came as soon
as I heard what happened.

20:58.431 --> 21:00.607
I'm helping Sanchez
with the security system.

21:00.607 --> 21:02.304
He's good at DIY.

21:02.304 --> 21:04.132
Yeah.
You got any idea

21:04.132 --> 21:05.133
who could have
done this, or why?

21:05.133 --> 21:07.091
No. Course not.

21:07.091 --> 21:09.050
It's crazy.
I-I can't believe it.

21:11.357 --> 21:14.273
So you've never seen anyone
suspicious hanging around here?

21:15.448 --> 21:18.102
All right. All right,
look, Hondo, come here.

21:19.190 --> 21:20.801
Look, I already grilled the kid.

21:20.801 --> 21:22.846
And before you ask,
I ran a background check, too.

21:22.846 --> 21:26.415
He's a dumbass actor,
crazy in love with Serena,

21:26.415 --> 21:28.199
but his only crime
is his acting.

21:28.199 --> 21:29.810
We're still gonna need
to check him out.

21:29.810 --> 21:31.420
Yeah, go ahead,
waste more time.

21:32.639 --> 21:35.381
Seems like all you're really
doing is chasing your own tail.

21:35.381 --> 21:37.078
Sanchez, what we're trying
to do is chase down a killer,

21:37.078 --> 21:38.601
not just protect Serena.

21:38.601 --> 21:40.821
To get justice for
the victim and her family.

21:40.821 --> 21:42.301
If it was me leading the team,

21:42.301 --> 21:43.650
we'd already have
a suspect in custody.

21:43.650 --> 21:45.391
Well, you're not
leading this team.

21:45.391 --> 21:47.349
You ain't even LAPD.

21:47.349 --> 21:48.437
You're a glorified bodyguard.

21:48.437 --> 21:50.352
So how about
you just do your job

21:50.352 --> 21:52.006
and let me do mine?

21:53.660 --> 21:55.226
Serena, you should
seriously consider

21:55.226 --> 21:57.403
coming back to HQ.
It would be a lot safer.

21:57.403 --> 21:58.882
Oh, what if it takes you
weeks to catch him?

21:58.882 --> 22:01.929
She just supposed
to live at HQ until then?

22:01.929 --> 22:04.323
No, no, no, she's much
better off staying here.

22:07.674 --> 22:09.328
All right,
this guy ain't coming back.

22:10.590 --> 22:11.939
But if he does, there is no way
he's getting through me

22:11.939 --> 22:14.028
or this security system.

22:16.335 --> 22:17.684
She stays.

22:19.729 --> 22:21.949
Okay. If you
change your mind,

22:21.949 --> 22:23.080
please call me.

22:23.080 --> 22:24.952
Any time.
Day or night.

22:34.178 --> 22:36.659
Boyfriend was acting
jumpy as hell.

22:38.008 --> 22:39.140
Could be because
someone just tried

22:39.140 --> 22:40.794
- to kill his girlfriend.
- Yeah.

22:41.969 --> 22:43.405
Deacon, you see
that Pontiac?

22:43.405 --> 22:45.755
Yeah.
Could be paparazzi.

22:45.755 --> 22:46.974
Maybe they
finally have

22:46.974 --> 22:48.062
caught wind of
what happened.

22:49.542 --> 22:50.630
Passenger matches
the description

22:50.630 --> 22:51.805
Sanchez gave us of the suspect.

22:52.936 --> 22:55.330
Well, that's a big move,
showing up to a crime scene

22:55.330 --> 22:56.592
only a few hours after
you kill someone.

22:56.592 --> 22:58.551
And with company?

22:58.551 --> 23:00.074
Call it in.

23:02.032 --> 23:03.599
30-David to Dispatch.

23:03.599 --> 23:04.905
Need you to run
a plate for me.
Hey, LAPD!

23:04.905 --> 23:06.559
Hold up, stop your engine.

23:06.559 --> 23:08.604
I said stop your engine!

23:09.257 --> 23:11.433
Get to cover!

23:28.319 --> 23:29.495
Passenger's gone.

23:29.495 --> 23:31.932
Out of the car.

23:31.932 --> 23:33.977
On the ground.
Hands behind your back.

23:33.977 --> 23:35.718
Going hands-on.20-David,

23:35.718 --> 23:37.416
all units be on the lookout
for a suspect.

23:37.416 --> 23:40.331
40s, white, dark hair,
wearing a black T-shirt,

23:40.331 --> 23:42.421
in the vicinity of
Laurel Canyon and Mulholland.

23:42.421 --> 23:44.858
Consider him
armed and dangerous.

23:48.427 --> 23:50.472
Any progress IDing
the driver we brought in?

23:50.472 --> 23:52.909
Name's Aviv Goldstein.
He's Israeli mafia.

23:52.909 --> 23:54.433
Just going through a list
of his associates now.

23:54.433 --> 23:56.173
What would Israeli Mafia
want with Serena?

23:56.173 --> 23:57.479
Wait. Hold up. Go back.

23:57.479 --> 24:00.482
That's him.
I recognize him from the car.

24:00.482 --> 24:02.266
Okay, Ari Peretz.

24:02.266 --> 24:03.616
Did a decade
in the Israeli army.

24:03.616 --> 24:05.269
Sanchez was right
about the military angle.

24:05.269 --> 24:06.619
He just got out of
Victorville penitentiary

24:06.619 --> 24:08.359
after doing five years
for tax evasion.

24:08.359 --> 24:10.013
Justice Department
tried to get him

24:10.013 --> 24:11.624
on a string of other crimes,
even a couple of murders,

24:11.624 --> 24:13.277
but couldn't get
any of it to stick.

24:13.277 --> 24:14.496
They took a page out of
the Al Capone playbook.

24:14.496 --> 24:15.845
Charging him
with tax evasion's

24:15.845 --> 24:17.456
the only way to get
him off the streets.

24:17.456 --> 24:18.631
That still doesn't explain
why he tried to kill Serena.

24:18.631 --> 24:20.284
Wait a minute, whoa, whoa.

24:20.284 --> 24:21.808
Check out Ari's address
on the trial paperwork.

24:21.808 --> 24:23.940
That's Serena's address.

24:23.940 --> 24:25.420
He used to live
in that house.

24:25.420 --> 24:27.161
Okay, the government
must've seized his property

24:27.161 --> 24:28.336
to cover the taxes he owed.

24:28.336 --> 24:29.337
They did, and then Serena

24:29.337 --> 24:30.730
bought the house last year

24:30.730 --> 24:32.383
after the Justice Department
auctioned it off.

24:32.383 --> 24:33.820
So, this isn't
about Serena at all.

24:33.820 --> 24:35.343
He's after something
inside the house.

24:35.343 --> 24:36.692
He must've not found it
the first time,

24:36.692 --> 24:37.998
that's why he came back,
to look for it.

24:37.998 --> 24:39.608
Whatever it is,
must be pretty important

24:39.608 --> 24:41.218
if he'd take
such a big risk.

24:41.218 --> 24:42.916
Okay, we should put
surveillance on the house.

24:42.916 --> 24:44.526
If it's that important,
he'll probably try a third time.

24:44.526 --> 24:46.397
- Yeah, go.
- Let's go.

24:47.834 --> 24:49.836
What's up, Deac? Let me guess.

24:49.836 --> 24:51.054
You don't have
anyone in custody yet.

24:51.054 --> 24:52.534
We're working on it.

24:52.534 --> 24:54.449
You're starting to sound
like a broken record.

24:54.449 --> 24:56.277
Listen, we've ID'd a suspect.

24:56.277 --> 24:58.322
Ari Peretz. Israeli mafia.

24:58.322 --> 25:00.368
He used to own the house
that Serena lives in.

25:00.368 --> 25:01.412
We think he's after

25:01.412 --> 25:02.979
something hidden inside.

25:02.979 --> 25:06.374
So not a stalker, then?
He's not after Serena?

25:06.374 --> 25:07.636
No, seems not.

25:07.636 --> 25:09.682
Hmm. How'd Hondo take that news?

25:09.682 --> 25:12.554
The point is,
we don't think he's gonna quit

25:12.554 --> 25:14.817
until he gets whatever it is
he's after inside the house,

25:14.817 --> 25:16.036
so you need
to bring her in now.

25:16.036 --> 25:17.516
Look, you should see

25:17.516 --> 25:18.778
the security measures
I've put in place.

25:18.778 --> 25:20.562
This house is like Fort Knox.

25:20.562 --> 25:22.433
Yeah, still not as safe as HQ.

25:22.433 --> 25:24.000
All right?
Now is not the time

25:24.000 --> 25:25.045
for your pride
- to get in the way.
- Pride?

25:25.045 --> 25:26.133
What are you talking about?

25:26.133 --> 25:27.395
Yours. You're trying to prove

25:27.395 --> 25:28.831
to Hondo that you've got this,

25:28.831 --> 25:30.529
that you don't need SWAT,
but a woman's life

25:30.529 --> 25:32.139
is on the line,
and yours could be, too,

25:32.139 --> 25:35.359
so for God's sake, Sanchez,
try working with us.

25:37.536 --> 25:39.625
Fine. I'll bring her in.

25:45.674 --> 25:47.981
Catching up on a little
light stalking?

25:47.981 --> 25:50.549
Ha, ha. No, uh,
I had a thought.

25:50.549 --> 25:52.072
We got a name for
our suspect now:

25:52.072 --> 25:53.682
Ari Peretz.

25:53.682 --> 25:56.076
But no current address since
he was released from prison.

25:56.076 --> 25:57.904
How are creepy
long-lens shots

25:57.904 --> 25:59.601
of Serena gonna
help find him?

25:59.601 --> 26:01.298
I figured there might be a clue
in one of the photos

26:01.298 --> 26:03.387
taken by our stalker buddy, Leo.

26:03.387 --> 26:04.911
I'll give you a hand.

26:04.911 --> 26:06.303
If Ari was
staking out the house,

26:06.303 --> 26:08.610
maybe we spot him
in a different vehicle

26:08.610 --> 26:10.307
or with someone we can ID.

26:10.307 --> 26:14.355
Sometimes you are more
than a pretty face, Street.

26:14.355 --> 26:15.835
Who's this guy with her?

26:15.835 --> 26:17.401
Serena's boyfriend, Cody.

26:17.401 --> 26:18.794
Hondo had me dig into him,

26:18.794 --> 26:20.013
but there's not even

26:20.013 --> 26:21.623
a speeding ticket
to the guy's name.

26:22.668 --> 26:23.930
You ever load
a heavy-looking duffel

26:23.930 --> 26:25.584
into the trunk of
your car at 3:00 am?

26:25.584 --> 26:27.542
Only when I've got a body
to get rid of. Why?

26:27.542 --> 26:29.152
Check this out.

26:30.589 --> 26:32.591
Here's Cody loading
a bag into his car

26:32.591 --> 26:33.809
in the middle
of the night.

26:33.809 --> 26:35.594
And here he is
next day.

26:35.594 --> 26:36.682
20-year-old Taurus is gone;

26:36.682 --> 26:38.901
in its place,
a brand new Lambo.

26:38.901 --> 26:41.469
I don't think that's
a body in that bag.

26:41.469 --> 26:43.819
Working theory is that
Ari left something in the house.

26:43.819 --> 26:45.691
What's the bet
it was money?

26:45.691 --> 26:47.388
And what's the bet
he now wants it back?

26:48.389 --> 26:50.652
Hey, Deac,
we got something.

26:50.652 --> 26:53.307
Cody's bank account?
It's in the red.

26:53.307 --> 26:55.352
He hasn't booked
an acting gig in months,

26:55.352 --> 26:57.180
but suddenly he's buying
Serena a Lamborghini?

26:57.180 --> 26:58.791
Which he paid cash
for, by the way.

26:58.791 --> 27:00.227
Ari must've stashed
money in the house,

27:00.227 --> 27:01.663
most likely drug money.

27:01.663 --> 27:03.099
The master bathroom
was being remodeled.

27:03.099 --> 27:04.797
If the cash was
hidden in the walls...

27:04.797 --> 27:06.146
Cody's into DIY, he probably
stumbled upon the money

27:06.146 --> 27:07.495
when he was doing
the remodel himself.

27:07.495 --> 27:09.845
Explains why Ari had
a hammer with him.

27:09.845 --> 27:11.673
Was gonna use it
to smash through the wall.

27:11.673 --> 27:13.066
The poor maid
got in the way.

27:13.066 --> 27:14.502
Ari would've seen the remodel.

27:14.502 --> 27:15.808
He has to know the money's gone.

27:15.808 --> 27:17.200
He probably suspects
Serena has it.

27:17.200 --> 27:18.854
Must want it bad.
Couldn't wait till

27:18.854 --> 27:20.029
no one was home
to go looking for it.

27:20.029 --> 27:21.552
Well, I think I know why.

27:21.552 --> 27:22.945
I spoke to the official
in the Justice Department

27:22.945 --> 27:24.686
that handled
Ari's murder case.

27:24.686 --> 27:26.079
A new witness came forward.

27:26.079 --> 27:27.689
They're about to issue
an arrest warrant.

27:27.689 --> 27:29.473
Ari wants the money
so he can get out of Dodge.

27:29.473 --> 27:31.084
Yeah. I already called,
finally convinced Sanchez

27:31.084 --> 27:32.738
to bring Serena in,
but I'm gonna give him

27:32.738 --> 27:34.304
a heads-up,
make sure he's on the alert.

27:34.304 --> 27:35.697
And bring Cody in,
'cause if he's not

27:35.697 --> 27:37.786
on Ari's radar already,
he will be soon.

27:47.622 --> 27:49.276
Cody said he was just
running to the hardware store,

27:49.276 --> 27:50.451
and now I can't
get through to him.

27:50.451 --> 27:51.670
We can't leave
without him.

27:51.670 --> 27:52.932
Just text him.

27:52.932 --> 27:53.715
Tell him to meet us
at SWAT HQ.

27:53.715 --> 27:55.021
We got to go.

27:55.935 --> 27:57.414
Deac, no need to nag.

27:57.414 --> 27:59.329
We're on our way.
We're just leaving now.

27:59.329 --> 28:00.635
No, I understand,
but there's been

28:00.635 --> 28:02.202
a new development.
The suspect...

28:02.202 --> 28:03.246
Was that gunfire?

28:03.246 --> 28:04.639
Sanchez, talk to us.

28:04.639 --> 28:05.727
Officer down.

28:05.727 --> 28:07.207
Gray cargo van. License plate

28:07.207 --> 28:08.687
4-P something.

28:11.037 --> 28:13.300
This is 26-David.
Shots fired.

28:13.300 --> 28:14.823
Officer down
at Mendez residence.

28:14.823 --> 28:16.346
Drop the gun!

28:16.346 --> 28:17.391
One of them's got a, uh,

28:17.391 --> 28:18.740
scar on his neck. Spiderweb tat.

28:18.740 --> 28:19.872
Drop the gun!

28:22.004 --> 28:24.441
Hey! Let go of me!

28:24.441 --> 28:25.704
Please.

28:25.704 --> 28:27.009
Help!

28:31.057 --> 28:32.623
We've got a critically
injured cop in the hospital

28:32.623 --> 28:34.321
and Sanchez and Serena
out there somewhere,

28:34.321 --> 28:36.497
depending on us to find them,
so talk to me.

28:36.497 --> 28:38.499
Where we at with the BOLO
on the van that took them?

28:38.499 --> 28:40.588
Well, Sanchez only managed
to give us a partial plate,

28:40.588 --> 28:41.937
so I don't know
if we'll get lucky.

28:41.937 --> 28:43.678
Their phones
have been switched off,

28:43.678 --> 28:45.419
probably discarded, so we
can't track them that way.

28:45.419 --> 28:48.422
Working on the ID of the guy
with the spiderweb tattoo.

28:48.422 --> 28:50.206
Sanchez said he had
a scar on his neck, too,

28:50.206 --> 28:51.555
but it'll be
a while to run

28:51.555 --> 28:52.948
these identifiers
through the database.

28:52.948 --> 28:54.602
And Cody?

28:54.602 --> 28:55.821
I called him,
he didn't pick up.

28:55.821 --> 28:57.039
I'm triangulating
his phone.

28:57.039 --> 28:57.997
All right, Street, hurry.

28:57.997 --> 28:59.172
Sanchez and Serena need us.

28:59.172 --> 29:00.434
God only knows
what Ari's gonna do

29:00.434 --> 29:01.957
once he knows
his money's been spent.

29:08.877 --> 29:10.096
Come on.

29:17.494 --> 29:20.019
What do you people even want?

29:20.019 --> 29:21.324
My money.

29:21.324 --> 29:22.848
She knows what
I'm talking about.

29:22.848 --> 29:25.241
No, I don't. What money?

29:25.241 --> 29:26.460
You've clearly got
the wrong person.

29:26.460 --> 29:28.070
Just let her go.

29:28.070 --> 29:29.724
Shut up.

29:35.338 --> 29:37.210
I had $6 million
hidden in the house.

29:37.210 --> 29:39.516
It's gone.
Where is it?

29:39.516 --> 29:40.866
$6 million?

29:40.866 --> 29:43.433
I have no idea, I swear.
I swear!

29:43.433 --> 29:45.087
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Don't!

29:45.087 --> 29:46.915
She's obviously
telling you the truth.

29:48.308 --> 29:51.050
It was hidden
in the walls in the bathroom.

29:51.050 --> 29:52.529
Now it's vanished.

29:53.574 --> 29:54.836
Oh... Oh, God.

29:54.836 --> 29:56.620
M-My boyfriend's
remodeling the bathroom.

29:57.970 --> 29:59.928
So your boyfriend has my money.

30:02.626 --> 30:05.194
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
No! No, no, no, no!

30:05.194 --> 30:06.848
Leave her alone!

30:06.848 --> 30:08.850
Stop, let her go! No!

30:11.679 --> 30:13.159
Call your boyfriend.

30:13.159 --> 30:15.161
Tell him to bring
my money back or you die.

30:16.510 --> 30:18.077
Only if you agree to let us go

30:18.077 --> 30:19.948
once youhave it.

30:19.948 --> 30:21.471
Sure.

30:22.951 --> 30:24.866
Hurry up.

30:24.866 --> 30:26.607
Make the call.

30:33.396 --> 30:35.616
I need to update
Hicks on the situation.

30:35.616 --> 30:37.052
Please tell me
you've made progress

30:37.052 --> 30:38.271
locating Serena and Sanchez.

30:38.271 --> 30:39.663
I got nothing
on the suspect

30:39.663 --> 30:41.100
with the spiderweb
tattoo or the van.

30:41.100 --> 30:42.710
But I got a lock
on Cody's phone.

30:42.710 --> 30:44.712
He was at the Lamborghini
dealership in Hollywood.

30:44.712 --> 30:46.670
Vandelli's team scooped him up.
They're bringing him in now.

30:46.670 --> 30:48.281
All right,
I'll question him.

30:48.281 --> 30:50.196
You two stay on the hunt
for Serena and Sanchez.

30:52.502 --> 30:55.331
You got to let me go. Please!
I got somewhere to be!

30:55.331 --> 30:57.246
Whoa, whoa. Sit down,
sit down, sit down.

30:57.246 --> 30:59.031
Hey, we know
about the money

30:59.031 --> 31:00.467
that you found at
Serena's house, Cody.

31:00.467 --> 31:01.816
Has she tried to contact you?

31:01.816 --> 31:04.166
Do you have any
idea where she is?

31:04.166 --> 31:05.646
Look, when the officers
caught up with you,

31:05.646 --> 31:07.343
you were at the
Lamborghini dealership.

31:07.343 --> 31:08.910
I'm guessing you were
trying to return the car

31:08.910 --> 31:10.433
to get your
money back.

31:10.433 --> 31:12.348
Except that wasn't your money
to begin with,

31:12.348 --> 31:15.003
and the person that belongs to,
you do not want to steal from.

31:15.003 --> 31:17.571
We know he's holding Serena
and Sanchez hostage.

31:17.571 --> 31:19.878
Where did he tell you
to bring the cash?

31:19.878 --> 31:22.228
He said he would kill her
if I told you.

31:22.228 --> 31:23.620
Cody, look,

31:23.620 --> 31:26.362
we're your only chance
at saving Serena.

31:26.362 --> 31:29.061
And our guy
Sanchez, too,

31:29.061 --> 31:30.584
but we need
your help to do that.

31:30.584 --> 31:31.933
Where did he tell you
to bring the money?

31:31.933 --> 31:33.152
What time is it?

31:33.152 --> 31:34.153
It's 4:30.

31:34.153 --> 31:35.719
Then it doesn't matter.

31:35.719 --> 31:37.069
It's already too late.

31:39.201 --> 31:41.377
Hey, we don't know that yet.

31:42.813 --> 31:45.120
Cody was supposed
to drop $6 million

31:45.120 --> 31:47.253
in a bag at Westside mall
five minutes ago.

31:47.253 --> 31:48.732
Ari will probably call
him again to find out

31:48.732 --> 31:50.169
why he didn't show up.
We could trace it.

31:50.169 --> 31:51.822
Deacon and Luca
are already on it.

31:51.822 --> 31:54.129
Might have a hit on the suspect
with a spiderweb tattoo.

31:54.129 --> 31:56.915
Isaac Klein. He and Ari were
in the same Israeli army unit.

31:56.915 --> 31:58.742
I checked the Border
Control database

31:58.742 --> 32:00.309
for anyone who
entered the U.S.

32:00.309 --> 32:02.050
in the last year on
an Israeli passport.

32:02.050 --> 32:03.791
We got an address
for him?

32:03.791 --> 32:05.706
No, but looks like he works
in construction supply,

32:05.706 --> 32:07.838
got two warehousesin L.A.

32:07.838 --> 32:09.231
When Serena called him,

32:09.231 --> 32:10.711
Cody heard freeway noise
in the background.

32:10.711 --> 32:12.278
Here are the two sites.

32:12.278 --> 32:14.106
One of them's
right by the 5.

32:14.106 --> 32:16.847
What are we waiting for?
Let's go.

32:29.121 --> 32:31.340
Your boyfriend
didn't show up with my money.

32:31.340 --> 32:33.429
He's probably just
stuck in traffic.

32:33.429 --> 32:36.084
Or $6 million is worth
more to him than you.

32:36.084 --> 32:37.956
Try him again.

32:37.956 --> 32:39.174
Don't worry, I'll find him.

32:39.174 --> 32:40.871
I just don't
need you for that.

32:41.960 --> 32:43.657
You don't want to do this.

32:43.657 --> 32:44.745
I'm a cop.

32:44.745 --> 32:46.660
I'm LAPD SWAT.

32:46.660 --> 32:48.401
That so?

32:49.576 --> 32:50.925
Where's your
badge, then?

32:50.925 --> 32:52.274
A cop,

32:52.274 --> 32:54.581
even one moonlighting
like a bodyguard,

32:54.581 --> 32:56.322
never leaves home
without his badge.

33:04.069 --> 33:06.245
If you kill us, you're never
gonna get away with it.

33:06.245 --> 33:09.726
No matter where you go,
my buddies will track you down

33:09.726 --> 33:11.206
and make you pay.

33:11.206 --> 33:13.774
I have a plane waiting for me.

33:13.774 --> 33:15.341
Once I find her boyfriend

33:15.341 --> 33:16.907
and get my
money back,

33:16.907 --> 33:18.518
I'll vanish.

33:18.518 --> 33:22.391
Your buddies will never find me.

33:22.391 --> 33:24.002
And they won't
find you, either.

33:25.090 --> 33:27.179
If you're gonna do this,
why don't you, um...

33:27.179 --> 33:30.051
come a little closer...

33:30.051 --> 33:31.705
so you don't miss.

33:37.798 --> 33:39.539
Serena, down!

33:45.675 --> 33:47.373
- Suspect down.
- Drop the weapon!

33:47.373 --> 33:49.114
On your knees,
hands behind your head.

33:49.114 --> 33:50.506
Two suspects on the move,

33:50.506 --> 33:52.030
headed for
the northwest corner.

33:54.684 --> 33:57.078
Exit's in the other direction.

33:57.078 --> 33:58.775
- Street, you good?
- Good!

34:04.303 --> 34:06.305
Stay down! Give me your hand.

34:06.305 --> 34:09.960
Give me your other hand.
Suspect in custody.

34:15.531 --> 34:17.229
This is 20-David to Command.

34:17.229 --> 34:19.492
Three suspects in custody,
two suspects down.

34:23.713 --> 34:25.802
Let's get you up.
You okay?

34:25.802 --> 34:27.630
I got you.

34:29.676 --> 34:32.505
25-David. Serena's safe.
We're Code 4 all around.

34:32.505 --> 34:33.767
Let's get you
out of here.

34:33.767 --> 34:34.985
Thank you.

34:49.174 --> 34:50.914
Hey, 20-David.

34:53.134 --> 34:55.093
Close to the wire there, huh?

34:55.093 --> 34:58.096
Had me a little worried.

34:59.097 --> 35:00.924
But, um...

35:00.924 --> 35:03.405
Thanks. I owe you guys.

35:04.537 --> 35:07.844
Yeah, well,
we couldn't have found you

35:07.844 --> 35:09.542
if you hadn't given us
those clues.

35:10.717 --> 35:12.719
Teamwork, huh?

35:12.719 --> 35:14.112
Makes the dream work.

35:15.591 --> 35:18.812
Yeah.

35:20.030 --> 35:21.945
Hey, uh, Hondo.

35:25.558 --> 35:28.082
I'm glad it was you
leading the team.

35:36.525 --> 35:39.746
Anyway... I better move.

35:39.746 --> 35:41.051
Sanchez.

35:42.531 --> 35:46.100
Once a SWAT officer,
always a SWAT officer.

35:57.503 --> 35:59.331
Any closer to figuring out

35:59.331 --> 36:00.723
what you're gonna do
for your anniversary?

36:00.723 --> 36:03.813
Nope, still beating
my head against a wall.

36:03.813 --> 36:05.337
You want my advice,

36:05.337 --> 36:07.556
just spend the weekend
in bed together, dude.

36:07.556 --> 36:09.036
That's easy
for you to say.

36:09.036 --> 36:11.038
You and Chris are still
in the honeymoon phase.

36:11.038 --> 36:13.388
Wait a while, and try
living apart for three months.

36:13.388 --> 36:14.476
Kind of kills the romance.

36:14.476 --> 36:16.261
Bonnie's, uh,

36:16.261 --> 36:18.132
she's not away in Atlanta
for much longer, is she?

36:18.132 --> 36:20.743
She's stuck working there
for another month.

36:20.743 --> 36:22.832
But, you know,
between you and me,

36:22.832 --> 36:25.008
it's about more
than the distance.

36:25.008 --> 36:26.793
It's like we're living
two different lives these days.

36:26.793 --> 36:28.969
She's this top sports agent,

36:28.969 --> 36:30.884
rolling with all these
major players now.

36:30.884 --> 36:33.234
Guess I just feel like
we're drifting apart.

36:33.234 --> 36:35.410
That's why I'm trying
to make this weekend special.

36:36.672 --> 36:40.459
Well, still say a weekend
in bed's the answer.

36:48.293 --> 36:50.295
Hey, Sanchez. How you doing?

36:50.295 --> 36:52.210
I'm doing all right, man.

36:52.210 --> 36:54.821
I just got back from dropping
Serena off with Cody.

36:54.821 --> 36:57.650
Quite a reunion.

36:57.650 --> 36:58.825
Let me tell you,
I wish my girlfriend

36:58.825 --> 37:00.218
was that forgiving.

37:00.218 --> 37:01.784
I still don't get how
she didn't bat an eye

37:01.784 --> 37:03.221
at the fact that
her unemployed boyfriend

37:03.221 --> 37:04.961
bought her
a personalized Lamborghini.

37:04.961 --> 37:06.398
He told her
he made it big in crypto.

37:06.398 --> 37:07.573
Was a bid to impress her.

37:07.573 --> 37:09.401
He was worried
that she'd dump him

37:09.401 --> 37:10.402
now that she was
hitting the big time.

37:10.402 --> 37:12.621
Hey, did you figure out

37:12.621 --> 37:16.146
that, uh, anniversary
present yet for Bonnie?

37:16.146 --> 37:18.323
I heard the team
talking about it.

37:18.323 --> 37:21.195
No. I think I'm gonna buy her
roses, take her to dinner.

37:21.195 --> 37:24.764
Mm-hmm. How about, instead of
that tired old cliché,

37:24.764 --> 37:27.157
you take her
to Serena's premiere?

37:27.157 --> 37:28.594
It's this weekend.

37:28.594 --> 37:31.336
Champagne reception,
all the stars will be there.

37:31.336 --> 37:33.425
I can get you VIP access.

37:33.425 --> 37:35.122
Are you serious?

37:35.122 --> 37:36.863
Bonnie could meet
Ben what's-his-face.

37:36.863 --> 37:38.952
- Yeah.
- She would love that.

37:38.952 --> 37:41.259
Least I can do for
a fellow SWAT officer.

37:41.259 --> 37:43.304
Thanks, Sanchez.
I appreciate it.

37:43.304 --> 37:44.827
Yeah, man.

37:54.141 --> 37:56.491
Bonnie, hey.
You are not gonna believe this.

37:56.491 --> 37:59.277
I have something really cool
planned for this weekend.

38:03.803 --> 38:06.327
Uh, no. Yeah, sure, totally.
I get it.

38:07.328 --> 38:09.591
It's a big client.
I understand.

38:09.591 --> 38:11.201
Work's got to come first.

38:13.203 --> 38:15.597
Yeah. I'll talk to you later.

38:29.959 --> 38:31.091
Kelly, what are
you doing here?

38:31.091 --> 38:32.397
It's super late.

38:32.397 --> 38:34.224
Your mom know
where you're at?

38:34.224 --> 38:36.618
Come on, come on inside. Come.

38:37.837 --> 38:40.318
I'm gonna text her,
let her know where you're at.

38:40.318 --> 38:42.102
She's probably
worried sick about you.

38:44.887 --> 38:46.324
You said
you'd talk to her

38:46.324 --> 38:47.629
and get her to
change her mind.

38:47.629 --> 38:49.414
You didn't.

38:49.414 --> 38:52.025
Look, I called her,

38:52.025 --> 38:53.853
but I didn't try
to talk her out of it.

38:56.508 --> 38:59.206
End of the day,
it's your mom's decision, okay?

38:59.206 --> 39:00.686
And if she thinks
it's the right one,

39:00.686 --> 39:02.644
then I got to believe
that it's the right one.

39:02.644 --> 39:05.821
I know you're scared, okay?
Change can be difficult.

39:05.821 --> 39:08.084
I get it. I don't like
change much, either.

39:08.084 --> 39:09.738
But I've learned
that you can't fight it,

39:09.738 --> 39:12.828
and something good usually
comes from it in the end.

39:12.828 --> 39:16.571
You know, like when Street
moved the blender.

39:16.571 --> 39:17.703
What?

39:17.703 --> 39:20.706
Or when Chris left the team.

39:20.706 --> 39:22.360
I mean, I thought it would suck,

39:22.360 --> 39:24.710
and the truth is, it did.
For a time.

39:24.710 --> 39:27.495
But now we have
new people on the team.

39:27.495 --> 39:29.279
New family members.

39:29.279 --> 39:31.107
And it's good.

39:31.107 --> 39:33.022
Look, you're gonna
be okay, Kelly.

39:33.022 --> 39:34.720
You're gonna-- You're gonna make
tons of new friends,

39:34.720 --> 39:36.243
you're gonna be
right by the beach.

39:36.243 --> 39:37.462
There's a super cool

39:37.462 --> 39:39.202
surf break
I've been reading about.

39:39.202 --> 39:41.640
I'll come down, visit,
finally teach you how to surf.

39:41.640 --> 39:42.989
Really?

39:42.989 --> 39:44.773
Yeah, I promise.

39:44.773 --> 39:46.035
Okay? We'll catch some waves,
then we'll go

39:46.035 --> 39:47.689
to a café
by the beach afterwards

39:47.689 --> 39:50.083
and have some breakfast,
you know?

39:50.083 --> 39:51.301
Maybe I'll even

39:51.301 --> 39:53.086
get an acai bowl
for a change.

39:53.086 --> 39:54.304
Okay.

39:54.304 --> 39:55.610
Don't forget about that dog.

39:55.610 --> 39:57.046
I know you really want one.

39:57.046 --> 39:57.917
You've been begging
your mom for years

39:57.917 --> 39:59.005
to get a puppy.

39:59.005 --> 40:00.615
