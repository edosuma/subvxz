09:43.417 --> 09:44.709
Bye.

09:46.086 --> 09:50.173
Ryan Seacrest wants
to interview me right now.

09:50.215 --> 09:51.841
Really?

09:51.883 --> 09:53.552
I guess somebody
bailed last minute.

09:53.593 --> 09:55.053
Oh, I'm... I'm sorry.

09:55.095 --> 09:56.471
I know this
is really bad timing...

09:56.513 --> 09:58.223
No, no, no, it's okay.
Get ready.

09:58.265 --> 09:59.558
Shoot!
Where's my lipstick?

09:59.599 --> 10:01.560
Wait. Do you want
to have dinner?

10:01.601 --> 10:03.144
Yeah, uh, how about...

10:03.186 --> 10:04.396
how about 8:00?
Yes!

10:04.438 --> 10:06.064
I found it.

10:07.274 --> 10:08.649
Oh. Tonight's totally
not going to work.

10:08.691 --> 10:10.110
I booked studio time.

10:10.151 --> 10:11.486
But how about tomorrow?

10:11.528 --> 10:12.987
Uh, yeah, sure.

10:13.029 --> 10:14.155
Good.

10:14.197 --> 10:18.243
That way,
we can definitely talk.

10:18.285 --> 10:19.786
I'd like that.

10:19.827 --> 10:21.746
(chuckles)

10:21.788 --> 10:23.415
Me, too.

10:25.166 --> 10:26.834
I love you.

10:29.212 --> 10:31.172
I'm going to be
on Ryan Seacrest!

10:31.214 --> 10:33.300
Aah!
Go, go, go.

10:39.889 --> 10:42.058
Wow. What a
great place.

10:42.100 --> 10:43.435
Thanks. I lucked out.

10:43.477 --> 10:45.728
Almost got stuck
living in the dorms.

10:45.770 --> 10:47.188
Oh.

10:47.230 --> 10:48.607
Hey. Is this the famous Annie?

10:48.648 --> 10:50.108
Hi.
Of course, if I
lived in the dorms,

10:50.150 --> 10:51.192
I might have had
some privacy.

10:51.234 --> 10:53.861
Oh, who needs privacy?

10:53.903 --> 10:54.946
Annie, these are my roommates.

10:54.988 --> 10:56.615
I'm Julia, and this
is Wes and Aliyah.

10:56.656 --> 10:57.782
Hey.
Nice to meet you.

10:57.824 --> 10:59.200
You, too.
JULIA:
Charlie, music.

11:00.285 --> 11:01.119
Oh, yes, ma'am.

11:01.161 --> 11:02.537
Oh, and chips.

11:02.579 --> 11:04.539
Get your own chips.
I'm already sitting.

11:04.581 --> 11:07.459
So, you're a senior?
Yes.

11:07.501 --> 11:08.960
Oh, I remember
being a senior.

11:09.002 --> 11:10.295
You should.

11:10.337 --> 11:11.796
It was last year.

11:11.838 --> 11:12.922
I mean, the feeling.

11:12.964 --> 11:14.924
The excitement,
the possibilities...

11:14.966 --> 11:16.884
Going to sleep without having
600 pages of reading

11:16.926 --> 11:18.136
hanging over your head.

11:18.178 --> 11:19.387
No kidding. Did you check out

11:19.429 --> 11:20.472
Bowser's reading list?

11:20.514 --> 11:21.556
All Derrida, all the time.

11:21.598 --> 11:23.266
Dude is intense.
And long-winded.

11:23.308 --> 11:24.309
And brilliant.
Totally brilliant.

11:24.351 --> 11:25.310
Yeah.

11:25.352 --> 11:26.603
Is Derrida a professor of yours?

11:28.355 --> 11:29.856
No, he's a French philosopher.

11:29.897 --> 11:32.317
Charlie, we're boring her.
We're boring me.

11:32.359 --> 11:35.945
So do you know where you want
to go to college yet?

11:35.987 --> 11:40.158
Oh, no, but I definitely
want to apply here and USC.

11:40.200 --> 11:41.576
And Carnegie-Mellon
actually has

11:41.618 --> 11:43.828
a great theater program, so...

11:43.870 --> 11:44.496
It's in Pittsburgh.

11:44.538 --> 11:45.664
Don't be a snob.

11:45.704 --> 11:46.956
I wasn't being a snob.
The way you said

11:46.998 --> 11:48.500
Pittsburgh was like...
You're reading into it

11:48.542 --> 11:50.168
I wasn't.
like you always do.

11:50.210 --> 11:52.920
Geez, you guys,
take it down a notch.

11:52.962 --> 11:54.339
You're not dating anymore.

11:54.381 --> 11:55.674
JULIA: True.
Fight with her.

11:55.714 --> 11:57.008
CHARLIE: I don't
fight with her.

11:57.050 --> 11:58.801
That's actually what's so nice.

11:58.843 --> 12:00.512
Whatever. Got salsa?

12:00.554 --> 12:02.013
I'm sitting.
You know where it is.

12:02.055 --> 12:03.473
Okay.

12:07.310 --> 12:08.687
(chuckles)

12:12.190 --> 12:13.441
(school bell rings)

12:17.070 --> 12:18.446
Oh, hey.

12:18.488 --> 12:20.281
Hi.

12:20.323 --> 12:22.200
Uh, I was just...
I'm gonna come back later.

12:22.242 --> 12:23.535
No, wait, wait.

12:23.577 --> 12:27.497
Hey, hey, we need to talk
about what happened.

12:27.539 --> 12:30.208
Oh, uh, wh-wh-what
almost happened.

12:30.250 --> 12:33.002
I think that'll be
the best way for us
to put it behind us.

12:33.044 --> 12:36.297
Otherwise, it'll... fester.

12:36.339 --> 12:38.299
Yeah, you're right.

12:38.341 --> 12:40.801
Um... it's just that

12:40.843 --> 12:42.721
it was, it was so...

12:42.761 --> 12:43.804
Weird?

12:43.846 --> 12:45.390
Incredibly weird.

12:45.432 --> 12:47.517
I know. Look, I was just,
I was feeling really insecure,

12:47.559 --> 12:50.562
and the whole thing
with Joe Jonas and...

12:50.604 --> 12:52.522
You were there for me.

12:52.564 --> 12:54.065
And I...

12:54.107 --> 12:55.483
I confused that
for something else.

12:55.525 --> 12:56.984
And I'm really sorry

12:57.026 --> 12:58.194
that I made
things awkward.

12:58.236 --> 13:00.071
No, it wasn't your fault,
trust me.

13:00.113 --> 13:02.699
I... I was
in a strange place, too.

13:02.741 --> 13:05.034
And I guess

13:05.076 --> 13:06.994
every once in a while,
you know,

13:07.036 --> 13:10.415
people are bound to... to go
through this with their friends.

13:10.457 --> 13:11.750
Yeah, it's pretty much
inevitable, right?
Yeah.

13:11.790 --> 13:14.419
Hence the term
"friends with benefits."

13:14.461 --> 13:17.422
Not, not that I got a benefit
from you.

13:17.464 --> 13:18.757
It's just,

13:18.797 --> 13:19.924
it's common, right?

13:19.966 --> 13:22.343
But it doesn't mean anything.

13:22.385 --> 13:24.345
Exactly. It means nothing.

13:26.055 --> 13:27.599
So we can move past it?

13:27.641 --> 13:29.726
Consider it moved past.

13:29.768 --> 13:31.311
Grea
t .
Awesome.

13:31.352 --> 13:35.106
'Cause I can only handle so much
stress in my life. My dad,

13:35.148 --> 13:36.775
he's kind of maxing me out.

13:36.815 --> 13:38.526
Oh, no, are things still bad?

13:38.568 --> 13:40.111
Yeah. I'll be fine

13:40.153 --> 13:41.820
as long as I don't go home.

13:41.862 --> 13:43.615
Figure I'll set up
a cot here and...

13:43.657 --> 13:46.367
Oh, use those emergency showers
in the Science Lab.

13:46.409 --> 13:47.577
(laughs) Come on.

13:47.619 --> 13:49.287
You guys are gonna
figure things out.

13:49.329 --> 13:50.580
You have a great relationship.

13:50.622 --> 13:54.501
Had. I screwed up big time.

13:57.754 --> 13:59.297
Then apologize.

13:59.339 --> 14:01.758
As a friend
once told me,

14:01.800 --> 14:03.884
you don't want
to let things fester.

14:03.926 --> 14:06.638
(chuckles)
Sounds like a pretty cool guy,

14:06.680 --> 14:07.972
your friend.

14:08.014 --> 14:09.724
Ah, he has his moments.

14:09.766 --> 14:11.726
(both chuckle)

14:11.768 --> 14:13.186
Clearly, Hemingway is commenting

14:13.227 --> 14:14.937
on man's relationship
with nature.

14:14.979 --> 14:17.649
But what is he saying about
man's relationship with man?

14:17.691 --> 14:19.484
(door opens)

14:19.526 --> 14:21.486
Sorry to interrupt,
but there's an emergency!

14:21.528 --> 14:24.989
An emergency?!
Wh-What happened? Is he okay?

14:25.031 --> 14:26.907
Oh, nothing happened. He's fine.

14:26.949 --> 14:28.451
I have an audition.

14:28.493 --> 14:31.162
An audition?
Is that an emergency?

14:31.204 --> 14:35.124
What happened to neither rain,
nor sleet, nor gloom of night?

14:35.166 --> 14:37.502
It's for CSI: Miami!

14:37.544 --> 14:38.837
Wait, Erin!

14:38.878 --> 14:41.506
(Jacques crying)

14:46.803 --> 14:50.557
And on page 92, Santiago says,
"You are killing me, fish,

14:50.598 --> 14:53.309
(baby crying)
but you have a right to."

14:54.894 --> 14:56.103
Is he teething?

14:56.145 --> 14:57.980
You should give him
something to suck on.

14:58.022 --> 14:59.607
Yeah, he's fine. Let's focus.

14:59.649 --> 15:04.445
Hey, hey! So he goes on, "Never
have I ever seen a greater

15:04.487 --> 15:06.573
"or more beautiful or calmer

15:06.614 --> 15:09.784
or a more noble thing than you."
Yeah.

15:09.826 --> 15:11.035
Have you checked
his diaper?

15:11.077 --> 15:12.579
His diaper's fine!

15:12.620 --> 15:13.621
(Jacques crying harder)
Oh!

15:13.663 --> 15:15.331
His diaper's... I don't know.

15:15.373 --> 15:16.666
I'll... I'll be right back.

15:18.793 --> 15:21.003
(crying continues)

15:21.045 --> 15:23.005
(sighs)

15:23.047 --> 15:25.966
Hey, Deb, it's Ryan.

15:26.008 --> 15:27.844
I'm back up
to completely panicked,

15:27.886 --> 15:30.179
and I don't know
who else to call.

15:36.102 --> 15:37.395
Hi. Don't you know frowning

15:37.437 --> 15:38.772
that hard will drastically

15:38.813 --> 15:40.440
increase your future Botox bill?

15:40.481 --> 15:41.733
(sighs)

15:41.775 --> 15:42.817
What are you reading?

15:42.859 --> 15:44.277
I'm about a hundred pages in,

15:44.318 --> 15:45.653
and I still have no idea.

15:45.695 --> 15:48.030
Charlie and Julia kept going on
about how brilliant

15:48.072 --> 15:49.323
this Derrida guy is.

15:49.365 --> 15:51.117
And Julia is...?

15:51.158 --> 15:52.493
Charlie's ex-girlfriend.

15:52.535 --> 15:54.078
Really smart, really cool...

15:54.120 --> 15:55.121
Really threatening?

15:55.162 --> 15:56.330
Really, really threatening.

15:56.372 --> 15:58.625
Well, have you marked
your territory at least?

15:58.666 --> 16:00.126
What are you talking about?

16:00.167 --> 16:02.169
I don't mean,
"Have you peed on him?"

16:02.211 --> 16:03.838
(chuckles)

16:03.880 --> 16:05.924
I mean, have you
locked him down?

16:05.965 --> 16:08.008
Have you had the "Let's
be exclusive talk" yet?

16:08.050 --> 16:10.303
Oh. No.

16:10.344 --> 16:12.346
And I-I don't want to push.

16:12.388 --> 16:13.473
Well, how's the sex?

16:13.514 --> 16:15.809
Between Charlie and Julia?

16:15.850 --> 16:18.144
Judging by their chemistry,
it was probably pretty good.

16:18.185 --> 16:19.687
No, I mean
between the two of you.

16:19.729 --> 16:22.398
Mm... we haven't...

16:23.524 --> 16:25.318
...had sex yet.
Oh, my God!

16:25.359 --> 16:26.319
That's a problem.

16:26.360 --> 16:27.320
He's a college guy.

16:27.361 --> 16:28.863
If you want
to lock him down,

16:28.905 --> 16:30.448
you have
to give him the key.

16:30.490 --> 16:31.950
To your...

16:31.991 --> 16:35.495
I got it! I got it.

16:35.536 --> 16:37.747
Yo, man, I've been running on
empty for ten minutes.

16:37.789 --> 16:39.540
I told you
the service here sucks, kid.

16:39.582 --> 16:42.543
WAITRESS: Sorry, we
just changed shifts.

16:42.585 --> 16:44.545
Can I get you a refill?

16:44.587 --> 16:48.549
Uh... yes, yes, I would
love a refill. Thank you.

16:52.887 --> 16:54.013
Wow.

16:54.054 --> 16:56.724
I take back what I said
about the service.

16:56.766 --> 16:58.852
I'd let her
service me anytime.

16:58.893 --> 16:59.936
LIAM:
Yeah, no kidding.

16:59.978 --> 17:01.688
So hot.

17:01.729 --> 17:04.732
A girl like that'd help me
get over Ivy for sure.

17:04.773 --> 17:06.400
So do it. Ask her out.
You never know.

17:06.442 --> 17:07.861
I mean, sometimes hot girls go
for ugly guys

17:07.902 --> 17:09.069
so they can have the upper hand.

17:09.111 --> 17:10.946
Look who's funny today.

17:13.574 --> 17:14.742
Iced tea, right?

17:14.784 --> 17:16.661
Yeah, thanks.

17:16.703 --> 17:18.829
No problem.

17:26.796 --> 17:28.047
DIXON:
Thank you.

17:28.088 --> 17:29.340
You're welcome.

17:33.928 --> 17:36.848
Let me know if there's
anything else you want.

17:42.269 --> 17:43.354
LIAM:
Oh, man, it's on.

17:43.396 --> 17:44.898
She seemed really into you.

17:44.939 --> 17:46.273
Huh. Yeah, hilarious.

17:46.315 --> 17:47.608
Shut up, all right? Whatever.

17:47.650 --> 17:50.778
Do your thing.
Get her number, man.
Tell you what,

17:50.820 --> 17:52.739
I'm gonna let you have this one.

17:52.780 --> 17:56.034
I'm beat; I'm gonna head home.

17:56.075 --> 17:57.785
I'll see you guys later.

17:57.827 --> 17:59.662
See ya.
Peace, man.

18:02.331 --> 18:04.124
OMAR: How can I
be expected

18:04.166 --> 18:06.085
to keep every
single document?

18:08.004 --> 18:09.505
I'll call you back, Peter.

18:11.424 --> 18:12.884
What is it?

18:12.926 --> 18:16.888
I... I just, I wanted
to apologize, Dad.

18:16.930 --> 18:18.639
I was mad at you

18:18.681 --> 18:20.016
when I went to the counselor,

18:20.058 --> 18:21.642
and I never thought
that this would happen.

18:21.684 --> 18:23.644
Well, maybe you should
have thought about it.

18:23.686 --> 18:26.647
Do you realize
what you have done?

18:26.689 --> 18:27.815
I'm trying to apologize.

18:27.857 --> 18:29.108
It's too late
for that!

18:29.149 --> 18:30.693
My records are being subpoenaed!

18:30.735 --> 18:32.820
I'm under investigation!

18:32.862 --> 18:35.239
All because my
ahmagh son

18:35.281 --> 18:37.742
couldn't keep
his big mouth shut!

18:37.784 --> 18:39.827

Hi.

Oh, it looks
like you got

a little spit-up
on your shirt.

21:45.721 --> 21:47.514
Oh, of course.

21:47.556 --> 21:49.767
And I've lined up some more
interviews for tomorrow.

21:49.809 --> 21:51.769
Don't worry, none
of them are actresses.

21:51.811 --> 21:52.937
You didn't have to do that.

21:52.979 --> 21:54.354
Oh, honestly, it's my pleasure.

21:54.396 --> 21:55.898

of the beach club

21:57.357 --> 21:58.859

But at least he's letting
you keep your job, right?

22:00.945 --> 22:03.614
Well, I do have personal
assistant experience.

22:03.656 --> 22:05.699
Although I doubt he'll ask me
to alphabetize his nail polish.

22:05.741 --> 22:07.952
Jen didn't make you
do that, did she?

22:07.994 --> 22:09.954

It was better than

22:09.996 --> 22:12.039

22:14.583 --> 22:16.961
how difficult it would be
to reenter the workforce.

22:17.003 --> 22:18.004
Sure.

22:18.045 --> 22:19.546
Then again, I never
anticipated having to

22:19.588 --> 22:20.965

22:21.007 --> 22:22.382
No, no, I get it.

I mean, you know,
I didn't anticipate... this.

22:25.261 --> 22:26.887

single parent thing. So...

22:26.929 --> 22:30.557

the hang of cooking for one.

22:30.599 --> 22:32.810

22:34.937 --> 22:36.314

22:36.354 --> 22:39.066

starts with the washer.

28:34.213 --> 28:36.006
Um...
Gas station.

28:36.048 --> 28:37.883
Oh! Hey, I just found
money in my pocket.

28:37.924 --> 28:39.759
I'll-I'll get my wallet
from you tomorrow at school.

28:39.801 --> 28:41.011
All right, cool.

28:41.053 --> 28:42.262
TEDDY:
Night.
Peace, man.

28:45.098 --> 28:46.517
(clears throat)

28:46.559 --> 28:47.934
I forgot my wallet.

28:47.976 --> 28:50.396
Do you think I could come back
tomorrow and, uh, and settle up?

28:50.437 --> 28:52.439
I swear I'm good for it.

28:52.481 --> 28:53.691
It's not going to happen, man.

28:53.732 --> 28:55.025
Come up with the cash.

29:00.280 --> 29:01.781
First time I heard
her, I was like,

29:01.823 --> 29:03.534
"This girl has a fabulous--"
Do you rap at all?

29:03.576 --> 29:05.952
Um. No, not really.

29:05.994 --> 29:08.205
But she could. I'm telling
you, she's fabulous.

29:08.247 --> 29:10.082
T.I. might be up
for a little something.

29:10.123 --> 29:11.833
Ooh, how fabulous
would that be?

29:11.875 --> 29:13.335
So. Fabulous.
Totally fabulous.

29:15.128 --> 29:16.922
So, how is everything?

29:16.963 --> 29:18.840
Fabulous.
(cell phone chimes)

29:18.882 --> 29:20.551
Yo, my peeps
are heading down to Voyeur.

29:20.593 --> 29:22.678
Ooh. I hear they're playing you
non-stop. Can you guys come?

29:22.720 --> 29:25.639
Of course. I mean, if
it's okay with you.

29:25.681 --> 29:26.932
Is everything okay?

29:26.973 --> 29:29.935
Yeah, it's just my mom.
She wants me to come home.

29:29.976 --> 29:31.770
I guess so my dad
can yell at me again.

29:31.811 --> 29:33.689
Oh, so you can't
come to Voyeur?

29:33.731 --> 29:36.525
No, Ade, I can't, okay?

29:36.567 --> 29:37.901
I told you I have
stuff going on at home,

29:37.943 --> 29:38.944
stuff that I wanted
to talk to you about.

29:40.820 --> 29:43.073
I'm sorry.

29:43.115 --> 29:45.825
Hey. Let's go for
a walk, okay?

29:45.867 --> 29:48.370
Uh, guys, can you wait,
like, 5 minutes?

29:48.412 --> 29:49.455
RENÉE:
Of course.

29:49.496 --> 29:51.081
I'll watch you guys eat dessert.

29:51.123 --> 29:52.583
I hear
the key lime pie is fabulous.

29:52.625 --> 29:53.751
Don't worry
about it, okay?

29:53.792 --> 29:55.168
I should go home.
We'll talk later.

29:55.210 --> 29:56.878
Are you sure?

29:56.920 --> 29:58.589
Yeah. It was, uh,
nice meeting you guys.

30:01.007 --> 30:03.051
Bye.
(smooches loudly)

30:03.093 --> 30:04.261
RENÉE:
We are all set.

30:04.303 --> 30:06.305
(overlapping chatter)

30:10.434 --> 30:11.560
So...

30:11.602 --> 30:12.728
Yeah.

30:12.770 --> 30:13.895
That was...

30:13.937 --> 30:15.188
Not anticipated.

30:15.230 --> 30:16.523
(laughs)
At all.

30:16.565 --> 30:20.026
I-- I guess we're
both a little lonely.

30:20.068 --> 30:21.445
And, uh, in need of
some adult company.

30:21.487 --> 30:23.029
Exactly.

30:24.740 --> 30:25.783
So.

30:25.824 --> 30:27.785
Yeah.

30:27.826 --> 30:29.453
Well, you know,
the kids will be home soon,

30:29.495 --> 30:30.496
so you should probably...

30:30.537 --> 30:31.497
Copy that.

30:31.538 --> 30:33.123
Yeah.
All right.

30:34.249 --> 30:35.709
So, I'll just let myself out.

30:35.751 --> 30:37.586
Okay. Yeah.
Okay. Yeah.

30:37.628 --> 30:39.045
(laughs)

30:39.087 --> 30:40.964
All right.

30:42.882 --> 30:44.760
Oh...

30:46.679 --> 30:48.764
I'm sorry.
Oh.

30:48.806 --> 30:49.931
Did you forget something?

30:49.973 --> 30:50.974
Just my son.

30:51.016 --> 30:52.267
Right.

30:52.309 --> 30:53.477
Yeah.

30:55.688 --> 30:57.564
(exhales)

31:02.944 --> 31:04.822
(sighs)

31:06.740 --> 31:07.616
Hey.

31:09.576 --> 31:11.870
Thanks for coming.

31:11.911 --> 31:13.580
I'll-- I'll pay you back.

31:13.622 --> 31:15.248
No, it's all good.
It's all good.

31:18.794 --> 31:21.171
Ooh. Are you okay
to get home?

31:21.213 --> 31:23.215
Yeah, I-I only had a few.

31:24.424 --> 31:25.425
I'll drive you.

31:31.973 --> 31:34.059
♪ ♪

31:34.100 --> 31:35.101
Yeah, it's a great song,

31:35.143 --> 31:37.312
and a great song
is a great song,

31:37.354 --> 31:38.647
but it's even greater
when it's on vinyl.

31:38.689 --> 31:40.691
Well, I have a
lot to learn.

31:40.733 --> 31:42.192
Well, I'll teach you.

31:42.234 --> 31:43.736
Can you hear that?

31:43.777 --> 31:44.903
Hear what?

31:44.944 --> 31:47.364
The scratches, the imperfection,

31:47.406 --> 31:48.448
it's-it's not digital.

31:48.490 --> 31:50.033
It's...
Alive.

31:50.075 --> 31:50.992
Exactly.

31:52.118 --> 31:53.829
Yeah, I see what you mean.

31:53.871 --> 31:55.372
There's so much
I got to teach you.

31:55.414 --> 31:57.583
About T-Rex
and The Velvet Underground.

31:57.624 --> 32:01.044
Well, you can consider
me your student.

32:12.055 --> 32:13.682
All right.
Let me figure out

32:13.724 --> 32:15.893
what I'm going to
play you next.

32:15.934 --> 32:17.394
Um...

32:17.436 --> 32:18.520
I'll be right back.

32:30.699 --> 32:31.991
(chuckles softly)

32:34.494 --> 32:37.038
(sighs)

32:37.080 --> 32:39.207
Okay.

32:41.627 --> 32:43.503
(laughs)

32:46.256 --> 32:47.591
No.

32:47.633 --> 32:50.636
(sighs)

32:52.805 --> 32:55.265
Okay.

32:57.976 --> 32:59.436
Oh, my God!

32:59.478 --> 33:02.314
Oops.
Sorry.

33:02.355 --> 33:04.065
See you later.

33:09.988 --> 33:11.323
All right, I'm back.

33:11.364 --> 33:14.159
Ready to get yelled at again.

33:14.200 --> 33:15.994
Hey.

33:17.496 --> 33:18.705
What's wrong?

33:20.165 --> 33:21.750
Mom, are you...?

33:21.792 --> 33:23.209
The police, they--

33:23.251 --> 33:25.337
they subpoenaed
your father's records.

33:25.378 --> 33:26.379
Yeah, yeah, I know.

33:26.421 --> 33:27.631
But he has good lawyers.

33:29.382 --> 33:31.259
What? What is it?

33:32.427 --> 33:34.387
He left.

33:34.429 --> 33:37.223
Wait, what do you mean he left?

33:37.265 --> 33:40.560
He was afraid
he'd get sent to jail. So...

33:40.602 --> 33:42.938
Where'd he go?

33:44.690 --> 33:46.566
Back to Iran.

33:49.152 --> 33:50.320
What?

33:50.362 --> 33:51.655
He's gone, Navid.

33:59.120 --> 34:01.581
Thank you.
See you guys later.

34:08.880 --> 34:10.757
Hey.

34:10.799 --> 34:12.551
Hi.

34:12.592 --> 34:13.635
So, uh, you okay?

34:13.677 --> 34:16.137
I'm completely mortified,

34:16.179 --> 34:18.806
but other than that...

34:18.849 --> 34:21.309
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

34:21.351 --> 34:23.101
No, I shouldn't have...
No, I shouldn't

34:23.143 --> 34:25.355
have let them in.
I just didn't think that...

34:25.397 --> 34:27.815
You know, I just thought there
would be something leading up...

34:27.858 --> 34:29.609
You know...
No, stop, please.

34:29.650 --> 34:31.277
I'm so embarrassed.
No, don't be.

34:31.319 --> 34:33.947
I, uh, I just didn't think
you wanted to yet.

34:33.989 --> 34:35.699
You know, I thought

34:35.741 --> 34:36.742
we were taking it slow.

34:36.783 --> 34:40.579
I know, I know, but I thought

34:40.620 --> 34:44.248
maybe you didn't want
to take it so slow anymore.

34:44.290 --> 34:46.292
Did I make you feel that way?

34:46.333 --> 34:50.129
Okay, uh...

34:50.170 --> 34:51.630
Look, the truth is,

34:51.672 --> 34:55.761
I... have only had sex
with one person.

34:55.802 --> 34:58.805
And I was feeling really
intimidated by Julia.

34:58.847 --> 35:01.474
And Naomi told me that
I had to lock you down

35:01.516 --> 35:03.894
and have sex with you, and...

35:03.936 --> 35:08.440
And it sounds so stupid now
that I'm saying it out loud.

35:08.481 --> 35:09.482
No, no, it doesn't.

35:09.524 --> 35:11.192
I just wish you
would have told me.

35:12.360 --> 35:14.237
Yeah.

35:14.279 --> 35:16.990
Well, it's not
exactly easy

35:17.032 --> 35:21.536
talking about, you know,
really personal stuff.

35:21.578 --> 35:23.080
You should be
when you're dating.

35:25.082 --> 35:26.625
What?

35:26.666 --> 35:28.001
Well, nothing.

35:28.043 --> 35:30.169
It's just, you know,
there's some stuff

35:30.211 --> 35:32.338
that you're not comfortable
talking to me about.

35:32.380 --> 35:34.173
Like what?

35:34.215 --> 35:36.175
Like how you got your scar.

35:39.096 --> 35:40.597
Not that you have to.

35:40.639 --> 35:41.890
I-- I shouldn't...

35:41.932 --> 35:44.935
No, you're right.

35:46.519 --> 35:49.648
Remember how I told you
I used to spend summers

35:49.689 --> 35:50.983
at my uncle's lake house?

35:51.024 --> 35:52.734
Yeah, in Minnesota, right?

35:52.776 --> 35:54.111
Yeah, exactly.

35:54.152 --> 35:56.029
Well, going down
to the lake house

35:56.071 --> 35:58.991
was the only chance
I'll get to see my dad.

35:59.032 --> 36:00.826
Sometimes

36:00.867 --> 36:02.494
he'd be there for a few weeks.

36:02.535 --> 36:05.371
Other times he would disappear
and leave me with my uncle.

36:05.413 --> 36:08.041
Yeah, Liam told me.

36:08.083 --> 36:10.418
Right.

36:10.460 --> 36:14.255
Did he tell you that
our uncle was a mean drunk?

36:16.215 --> 36:18.010
Well, he was.

36:18.051 --> 36:22.055
And, uh, he would take a whack
at me now and then.

36:22.097 --> 36:24.766
Did you say anything?

36:24.808 --> 36:25.976
No.

36:27.811 --> 36:30.396
I thought if I stopped
going down to the lake house,

36:30.438 --> 36:32.774
I would never get
to see my dad.

36:32.816 --> 36:34.484
It's dumb, I know.
I just...

36:34.526 --> 36:36.277
No, it's not dumb.

36:36.319 --> 36:37.445
Anyway, uh,

36:37.487 --> 36:41.074
one summer my dad was away
more than usual.

36:41.116 --> 36:46.245
And my uncle got sick
of me being around.

36:46.287 --> 36:48.081
He was drinking
all the time.

36:48.123 --> 36:51.668
And he was beating me up
all the time.

36:53.628 --> 36:58.675
And, uh, one day he got a belt.

37:00.468 --> 37:02.387
And that's the last time
I went there.

37:08.643 --> 37:11.021
And that's how I got my scar.

37:22.949 --> 37:25.535
Well, thank you
for telling me.

37:30.165 --> 37:32.458
So you still want
to lock me down?

37:32.500 --> 37:34.711
(chuckles)

37:34.753 --> 37:36.088
Definitely.

37:36.129 --> 37:37.380
Good.

37:56.858 --> 37:58.068
(clearing throat)

38:01.696 --> 38:04.157
Thanks.

38:04.199 --> 38:05.909
No problem.

38:09.704 --> 38:11.330
Look...

38:11.372 --> 38:14.042
I don't know
what's going on with me.

38:16.169 --> 38:18.004
I'm just confused.

38:18.046 --> 38:20.090
Yeah, I know you are.

38:22.508 --> 38:24.552
(sighs)

38:24.594 --> 38:29.015
Are you newly confused,

38:29.057 --> 38:31.768
or have you been
confused for a while?

38:35.981 --> 38:37.565
I guess it's been a while.

38:45.031 --> 38:47.826
Everyone thinks I got kicked out
of boarding school

38:47.867 --> 38:50.662
for having girls in my room.

38:50.703 --> 38:52.789
That's not what happened.

38:58.044 --> 39:02.548
I started having
these feelings...

39:02.590 --> 39:04.134
for my roommate.

39:06.594 --> 39:09.430
I thought it was just
a one time thing, you know,

39:09.472 --> 39:11.557
and I thought,
if I could just get away,

39:11.599 --> 39:13.059
it wouldn't happen again.

39:13.101 --> 39:14.978
I mean, I couldn't be...

39:17.939 --> 39:19.398
...like that.
Yeah.

39:22.319 --> 39:26.364
Thought it would go away.

39:26.405 --> 39:29.575
But it didn't go away.

39:29.617 --> 39:33.330
And... it's not going to.

39:40.962 --> 39:42.255
(clears throat)

39:42.297 --> 39:43.840
Thanks for the ride.

39:57.062 --> 39:58.730
(engine starting)

39:58.771 --> 40:00.481
(knocking)

40:04.819 --> 40:06.279
Hi.

40:06.321 --> 40:09.115
You okay?

40:09.157 --> 40:12.077
Um, I really need
to talk to someone.

40:12.118 --> 40:14.913
Is Adrianna...?

40:14.954 --> 40:16.414
I mean you.

40:16.455 --> 40:18.124
I need to talk to you.

40:20.501 --> 40:22.337
Please.

40:22.379 --> 40:24.714
Can I come in?
