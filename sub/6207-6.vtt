00:03.235 --> 00:06.837
You chose a demon over your
own brother and look what happened.

00:06.838 --> 00:11.041
I did it. I started the Apocalypse,
and I set Lucifer free.

00:11.042 --> 00:17.392
- I'm sorry. I would give anything to take it all back.
- I know you would.

00:18.083 --> 00:21.218
If we're gonna be a team,
it has to be a two-way street.

00:21.219 --> 00:25.055
We gotta just grab on to whatever's in front
of us, kick its ass, and go down fighting.

00:25.056 --> 00:27.556
I can get onboard with that.

00:35.800 --> 00:38.300
Go!

00:40.000 --> 00:46.074

00:51.216 --> 00:52.783
Come on, get out of there.

00:52.784 --> 00:54.785
Yeah, go on. Go.

01:16.007 --> 01:18.507
Jimmy?

01:31.222 --> 01:32.856
I told you to go to bed.

01:32.857 --> 01:35.357
I can't. I'm dead.

01:36.127 --> 01:37.961
What is this? Ketchup?

01:37.962 --> 01:40.462
- Gross.
- Ow!

01:40.465 --> 01:41.698
You're mean.

01:41.699 --> 01:44.435
Yeah, that's what your parents
pay me for, to be mean.

01:44.436 --> 01:45.936
- Bed, now.
- Okay, okay.

01:45.937 --> 01:48.372
Just wait. Wait.

01:48.373 --> 01:51.542
I'll go to bed
if you let me touch your boob.

01:51.543 --> 01:54.043
Go.

02:43.428 --> 02:47.524
I'll take Amber home. Don't wait up.

02:54.439 --> 02:59.174
Amber?

02:59.944 --> 03:02.444
Amber?

03:16.427 --> 03:18.927
Francine!

03:26.371 --> 03:28.438
Agents Page and Plant, FBl.

03:28.439 --> 03:30.807
Gentlemen. What brings you by?

03:30.808 --> 03:34.818
- We need to see Amber Greer's body.
- Really? What for?

03:35.213 --> 03:39.343
The police report said something
clawed through her skull.

03:39.484 --> 03:43.053
You didn't read the autopsy report
that I e-mailed out this morning?

03:43.054 --> 03:45.989
We had server issues.

04:00.271 --> 04:03.674
When they brought her in,
we thought she was attacked by a wolf.

04:03.675 --> 04:07.042
- Or something.
But we were wrong.

04:09.614 --> 04:12.282
- Is that-?
It's a press-on nail.

04:12.283 --> 04:14.284
We found it in her temporal lobe.

04:14.285 --> 04:15.586
Is that even possible?

04:15.587 --> 04:17.754
You saying
that she did this to herself?

04:17.755 --> 04:20.445
Uh-huh. She scratched her brains out.

04:20.524 --> 04:25.195
It'd take hours and it'd hurt like hell,
but, sure, it's possible.

04:25.196 --> 04:26.897
- How?
- Pick your acronym.

04:26.898 --> 04:30.356
OCD, PCP, it all spells crazy.

04:30.568 --> 04:34.436
My guess?
Some kind of phantom itch.

04:34.639 --> 04:36.273
I mean, an extreme case, but-

04:36.274 --> 04:38.774
- Phantom itch?
- Yeah.

04:41.246 --> 04:44.114
All it takes is someone
talking about an itch...

04:44.115 --> 04:47.584
...or thinking about one,
and suddenly you can't stop scratching.

04:47.585 --> 04:50.085
- Thanks, doc.
- Okay.

04:54.292 --> 04:57.261
Okay, now, some of these questions
might seem a bit odd...

04:57.262 --> 04:59.890
...but, please, just bear with me.

05:00.064 --> 05:03.414
Have you noticed
any cold spots in the house?

05:03.468 --> 05:04.901
- No.
Okay.

05:04.902 --> 05:06.436
What about strange smells?

05:06.437 --> 05:08.937
Smells?
Like, say...

05:09.040 --> 05:11.540
What you looking for?

05:12.677 --> 05:15.177
Don't know yet.

05:16.781 --> 05:19.281
It's Jimmy, right?

05:21.452 --> 05:24.478
- So Amber was your babysitter?
- Yes, sir.

05:25.290 --> 05:27.658
Yeah, most of my babysitters sucked.

05:27.659 --> 05:30.794
Especially Miss Chancey,
she only cared about two things:

05:30.795 --> 05:33.295
Dynasty and bedtime.

05:36.934 --> 05:40.644
- Did you see anything strange that night?
- No, sir.

05:41.873 --> 05:44.007
You sure about that?

05:44.008 --> 05:47.377
I would tell you if I knew something.
I promise.

05:47.378 --> 05:49.878
A hundred percent, cross my heart.

05:52.383 --> 05:56.479
Well, Jimmy,
I happen to know you're lying.

05:56.688 --> 05:59.188
I'm not.

06:05.697 --> 06:11.207
We gonna start talking truth, or are you
and me gonna take a trip downtown?

06:12.503 --> 06:15.138
Kid said he put this
on the babysitter's hairbrush.

06:15.139 --> 06:18.475
Dean, no way itching powder
made that girl scratch her brains out.

06:18.476 --> 06:20.177
It's just ground-up maple seeds.

06:20.178 --> 06:22.679
You have any another theories,
I'm open to them.

06:25.316 --> 06:27.816
Yeah?

06:28.119 --> 06:30.619
Yeah, we'll be right there.

06:33.057 --> 06:35.753
Dr. Norris.

06:35.927 --> 06:38.427
Dr. Norris.

06:38.529 --> 06:39.730
What happened?

06:39.731 --> 06:41.064
Guy got electrocuted.

06:41.065 --> 06:42.265
Any idea how?

06:42.266 --> 06:46.036
Maybe a loose wire
or a piece of equipment shorted out.

06:46.037 --> 06:47.871
So far, we haven't found anything.

06:47.872 --> 06:49.439
- Witnesses?
- Yeah.

06:49.440 --> 06:51.007
Guy in there, Mr. Stanley.

06:51.008 --> 06:54.411
He says he saw it,
but he's not making a lick of sense.

06:54.412 --> 06:57.074
- Senile.
- Thanks.

07:02.453 --> 07:03.687
Mr. Stanley?

07:03.688 --> 07:06.188
It was just a joke.

07:06.290 --> 07:08.920
I didn't know it would really work.

07:09.060 --> 07:11.560
What would work?

07:12.530 --> 07:17.194
All I did was shake his hand.

07:33.785 --> 07:36.686
- You ready?
- Hit it, Mr. Wizard.

07:54.772 --> 07:57.272
That'll do, pig.

07:58.309 --> 08:00.809
What the hell?

08:01.479 --> 08:05.816
- That crap isn't supposed to work.
- This thing doesn't even have batteries.

08:05.817 --> 08:08.987
So, what?
Are we looking at cursed objects?

08:09.720 --> 08:11.521
Sounds good.

08:11.522 --> 08:15.083
Maybe there's
a powerful witch in town.

08:20.331 --> 08:25.268
Is there any link between
the joy buzzer and the itching powder?

08:25.436 --> 08:30.646
One was made in China, the other
in Mexico, bought from the same store.

08:45.056 --> 08:47.556
Sam.

08:59.303 --> 09:03.373
Welcome to the Conjurarium,
sanctum of magic and mystery.

09:04.475 --> 09:07.069
- You the owner?
- Yep.

09:07.345 --> 09:10.380
Sold any itching powder
or joy buzzers lately?

09:10.381 --> 09:12.182
Yeah, grand total, one of each.

09:12.183 --> 09:14.873
They aren't exactly big-ticket items.

09:15.419 --> 09:19.185
Look, you boys here
to buy something, or what?

09:19.357 --> 09:21.985
So you get many customers?

09:22.159 --> 09:23.693
Kids come in.

09:23.694 --> 09:26.930
They don't buy much, but they're
more than happy to break stuff.

09:26.931 --> 09:29.599
These days,
all they care about are iPhones...

09:29.600 --> 09:31.801
...and those kissing-vampire movies.

09:31.802 --> 09:33.603
The whole thing makes me just-

09:33.604 --> 09:36.104
Angry?

09:36.340 --> 09:38.840
Yeah. Yeah, I am angry.

09:38.943 --> 09:43.747
This shop has been my life for 20 years,
and now it's wasting away to nothing.

09:43.748 --> 09:46.616
- Which is why you hate them.
- I suppose.

09:46.617 --> 09:48.385
You wish there was something
you could do.

09:48.386 --> 09:49.686
Yeah, I guess I do.

09:49.687 --> 09:52.187
So you're taking revenge...

09:53.457 --> 09:55.957
...with this.

10:04.535 --> 10:07.904
Yeah, something tells me
this guy is not a powerful witch.

10:07.905 --> 10:10.533
Sorry. Sorry.

10:16.647 --> 10:18.982
I'll just slip this tooth
under your pillow...

10:18.983 --> 10:22.652
...and while you're asleep,
the tooth fairy will float down...

10:22.653 --> 10:24.888
...and swap it out for a quarter.

10:24.889 --> 10:30.339
Some freak is gonna come in my room
while I'm sleeping and take my tooth?

10:30.494 --> 10:33.657
Sounds scary. No, thank you.

10:34.231 --> 10:36.731
Come on.

10:46.177 --> 10:48.677
Good night, sweetie.

11:39.230 --> 11:43.564
Hold still,
you might feel just a little pinch.

11:57.915 --> 12:01.043
Well, I appreciate that,
Nurse Fremont.

12:01.252 --> 12:03.519
Please, call me Jen.

12:03.520 --> 12:06.020
Oh, Jen it is.

12:09.159 --> 12:10.960
What's up with Toothless?

12:10.961 --> 12:13.229
- Cavity Creeps get ahold of him?
- Close.

12:13.230 --> 12:20.033
He wrote up a description: 5'10",
350 pounds, wings and a pink tutu.

12:20.237 --> 12:23.806
- The tooth fairy.
- So he's whacked out on painkillers.

12:23.807 --> 12:29.017
Maybe. It got past locked doors and
windows without triggering the alarm.

12:29.046 --> 12:30.546
Come on, the tooth fairy?

12:30.547 --> 12:33.897
And it left 32 quarters
underneath his pillow.

12:33.951 --> 12:36.451
One for each tooth.

12:36.587 --> 12:39.455
Well, I will see your crazy
and raise you some.

12:39.456 --> 12:43.760
Kids upstairs with ulcers say they
got it from mixing Pop Rocks and Coke.

12:43.761 --> 12:47.253
Another guy, his face froze that way.

12:48.599 --> 12:51.099
What way?

12:57.574 --> 13:00.099
He held it too long and it stuck.

13:00.311 --> 13:02.941
They're flying in a plastic surgeon.

13:03.714 --> 13:06.584
So, I mean, if you add all that up...

13:08.819 --> 13:11.319
I got nothing.

13:12.222 --> 13:14.524
I thought Sea-Monkeys were real.

13:14.525 --> 13:16.359
They are. They're brine shrimp.

13:16.360 --> 13:18.294
No, no, no. I mean, like in the ads.

13:18.295 --> 13:22.098
Like the Sea-Monkey wife cooks the
pot roast for the Sea-Monkey husband...

13:22.099 --> 13:25.835
...and the Sea-Monkey kids play
with the dog in a Sea-Monkey castle.

13:25.836 --> 13:27.036
Real.

13:27.037 --> 13:29.272
- I mean, I was 6, but I believed it.
- Okay.

13:29.273 --> 13:33.266
The point is,
maybe that's the connection.

13:33.444 --> 13:35.778
The tooth fairy,
the Pop Rocks and Coke...

13:35.779 --> 13:38.982
...the joy buzzer that shocks you,
all lies that kids believe.

13:38.983 --> 13:41.017
And now they're coming true.

13:41.018 --> 13:43.886
Okay, so whatever's doing this
is reshaping reality.

13:43.887 --> 13:48.017
It has the powers of a god
or of a trickster.

13:48.559 --> 13:51.609
And the sense of humor
of a 9-year-old.

13:52.262 --> 13:54.762
Or you.

14:01.872 --> 14:04.340
Dude, seriously? Still with the ham?

14:04.341 --> 14:06.841
We don't have a fridge.

14:07.344 --> 14:10.404
Well, I found something. Here.

14:11.582 --> 14:14.784
Tooth fairy attack was here,
Pop Rocks and Coke was here...

14:14.785 --> 14:18.054
...then you've got itching powder,
face freeze and joy buzzer.

14:18.055 --> 14:20.390
All located within a two-mile radius.

14:20.391 --> 14:24.394
So we got a blast zone of weird,
and inside, fantasy becomes reality.

14:24.395 --> 14:27.864
- Looks like.
- And what's the A-bomb in the center?

14:27.865 --> 14:31.699
Four acres of farmland and a house.

14:33.670 --> 14:36.806
Our motel isn't in that circle,
by any chance?

14:36.807 --> 14:39.833
Yeah, why?

14:44.348 --> 14:48.717
Oh, dude.
That's not what I think it is, is it?

14:48.886 --> 14:51.386
I got bored. That nurse was hot.

14:52.723 --> 14:55.851
You know you can go
blind from that too.

14:56.026 --> 14:59.916
Give me five minutes.
We'll go check out that house.

15:00.464 --> 15:03.262
Hey. Do not use my razor.

15:40.104 --> 15:42.572
- Can I help you?
- Hi.

15:42.573 --> 15:44.307
What's your name?

15:44.308 --> 15:46.808
Who wants to know?

15:47.277 --> 15:50.974
The, ahem, FBl.

15:52.583 --> 15:55.083
Let me see that.

15:55.586 --> 15:58.086
So, what, you guys don't knock?

15:59.389 --> 16:01.691
- Are your parents home?
- They work.

16:01.692 --> 16:04.026
Well, you mind
if we ask you a few questions?

16:04.027 --> 16:06.028
Maybe take a look around the house?

16:06.029 --> 16:08.131
I don't know.

16:08.132 --> 16:12.142
Come on, you can trust us, huh?
We're the authorities.

16:22.813 --> 16:25.281
- What's that?
- It's called soup.

16:25.282 --> 16:27.782
You heat it up and you eat it.

16:29.453 --> 16:30.686
Right. I know.

16:30.687 --> 16:33.187
It's just...

16:34.158 --> 16:36.559
...I used to make dinner too,
when I was a kid.

16:36.560 --> 16:39.060
Well, I'm not a kid.

16:39.563 --> 16:42.063
Right. No, I know.

16:42.866 --> 16:45.366
- I'm Robert, by the way.
- Jesse.

16:45.435 --> 16:47.935
Jesse? Nice to meet you.

16:48.672 --> 16:51.842
- Did you draw this?
- It's the tooth fairy.

16:52.809 --> 16:55.344
That's what you think
the tooth fairy looks like, huh?

16:55.345 --> 16:58.872
- Yeah. My dad told me about him.
- Huh.

16:59.483 --> 17:02.652
What, didn't your dad
tell you about the tooth fairy?

17:02.653 --> 17:05.153
My dad?

17:05.388 --> 17:07.656
No. My dad told me different stories.

17:07.657 --> 17:10.348
Well, the tooth fairy isn't a story.

17:13.063 --> 17:15.031
What do you know
about itching powder?

17:15.031 --> 17:19.035
- It will make you scratch your brains out.
- Pop Rocks and Coke?

17:19.036 --> 17:24.066
You mix them and you'll end up
in the hospital. Everyone knows that.

17:26.510 --> 17:28.544
- You shouldn't have that.
- Why not?

17:28.545 --> 17:31.045
It can electrocute you.

17:32.082 --> 17:34.050
Actually, it can't.

17:34.051 --> 17:37.520
It's just a wind-up toy.
It's totally harmless.

17:37.521 --> 17:39.222
Doesn't even have batteries.

17:39.223 --> 17:40.590
So it can't shock you?

17:40.591 --> 17:42.592
Nope. Not at all.

17:42.593 --> 17:45.093
I swear.

17:46.630 --> 17:49.130
Oh, okay.

17:49.499 --> 17:53.603
All it does is just shake in your hand.
It's kind of lame. See?

17:58.308 --> 18:01.118
What did you say
your name was again?

18:07.316 --> 18:10.552
- Dude, what the hell?
- I had a hunch, I went with it.

18:10.553 --> 18:12.587
You risked my ass on a hunch?

18:12.588 --> 18:15.690
We know who's turning this town
into Willy Wonka's nightmare.

18:15.691 --> 18:19.027
- The kid.
- Everything Jesse believes comes true.

18:19.028 --> 18:23.198
He thinks the tooth fairy looks like
Belushi, joy buzzers really shock people.

18:23.199 --> 18:27.602
Convince him that joy buzzers don't work,
and they go back into crap toys.

18:27.603 --> 18:30.953
He probably doesn't even know
he's doing it.

18:34.410 --> 18:36.910
How is he doing it?

18:44.554 --> 18:48.786
So dug up what I could on Jesse Turner.
It's not much.

18:48.991 --> 18:52.392
B student,
won last year's Pinewood Derby.

18:52.595 --> 18:57.362
But get this: Jesse was adopted.
His birth records are sealed.

18:57.934 --> 18:59.234
So you unsealed them.

18:59.235 --> 19:03.305
There's no father listed, but Jesse's
biological mom is named Julia Wright.

19:03.306 --> 19:07.436
She lives in Elk Creek,
on the other side of the state.

19:32.735 --> 19:35.003
Whatever you're selling,
I'm not interested.

19:35.004 --> 19:38.940
Oh, we're not salesmen.
Agents Page and Plant, FBl.

19:44.146 --> 19:47.741
Put your badge in the slot.
Your partner's too.

20:02.031 --> 20:04.531
What do you want?

20:05.134 --> 20:08.626
We just had a few questions
about your son.

20:09.805 --> 20:12.305
I don't have a son.

20:13.242 --> 20:16.302
He was born March 29th, 1998,
in Omaha.

20:17.046 --> 20:19.546
You put him up for adoption.

20:20.750 --> 20:22.984
What about him?

20:22.985 --> 20:26.113
We were just wondering. Was it a-?

20:27.823 --> 20:30.323
Was it a normal pregnancy?

20:30.926 --> 20:33.828
- Was there anything strange?
- Stay away from me!

20:33.829 --> 20:36.329
Mrs. Wright, wait.

20:40.202 --> 20:42.702
We just wanna talk.

20:47.076 --> 20:49.344
You're not demons?

20:49.345 --> 20:51.845
How do you know about demons?

20:56.952 --> 20:59.452
I was possessed.

20:59.955 --> 21:03.891
A demon took control of my body
and I hurt people.

21:05.161 --> 21:07.028
I killed people.

21:07.029 --> 21:08.863
That wasn't you.

21:08.864 --> 21:11.232
But I was there.

21:11.233 --> 21:14.134
I heard a woman beg for mercy.

21:14.303 --> 21:17.893
I felt a young girl's blood
drip down my hands.

21:18.474 --> 21:20.308
That's how you knew about the salt.

21:20.309 --> 21:23.478
Yeah, I picked up tricks.
It was in my head for months.

21:23.479 --> 21:26.049
How many months?
Nine.

21:29.985 --> 21:31.519
So your son...

21:31.520 --> 21:36.548
Yeah, the whole time,
the pregnancy, birth...

21:36.726 --> 21:39.226
...all of it...

21:39.829 --> 21:43.164
...I was possessed.

21:43.165 --> 21:47.869
The night the baby was born,
I was alone...

21:47.870 --> 21:50.370
...and the pain was overwhelming.

21:51.173 --> 21:56.839
I screamed, and it came out a laugh
because the demon was happy.

21:59.114 --> 22:02.777
It used my body
to give birth to a child.

22:08.991 --> 22:12.861
When it was over, something changed,
maybe the demon was tired...

22:12.862 --> 22:16.152
...or if the pain
helped me fight it, but...

22:17.399 --> 22:19.899
...somehow I took control.

22:20.903 --> 22:24.639
And the demon wailed inside me,
it pounded against my skull.

22:24.640 --> 22:31.045
I thought my head
was gonna explode, but I knew.

22:32.214 --> 22:34.714
I knew what I had to do.

22:45.861 --> 22:51.432
- And when I was alone
with the baby, part of me-

22:51.433 --> 22:53.933
Part of me wanted to kill it.

22:57.873 --> 23:02.071
But God help me,
I couldn't do that...

23:02.244 --> 23:06.908
...so I put it up for adoption and I ran.

23:08.083 --> 23:10.583
Who was the father?

23:12.021 --> 23:14.521
I was a virgin.

23:17.593 --> 23:20.093
Have you seen my son?

23:20.429 --> 23:22.929
Is he human?

23:23.732 --> 23:26.232
His name is Jesse.

23:26.235 --> 23:29.136
He lives in Alliance.

23:30.272 --> 23:32.772
He's a good kid.

23:36.245 --> 23:37.946
So now what?

23:37.947 --> 23:40.447
We need help.

23:49.391 --> 23:51.292
I take it you got our message.

23:51.293 --> 23:53.628
It's lucky you found the boy.

23:53.629 --> 23:56.631
Oh, yeah, real lucky.
What do we do with him?

23:56.632 --> 23:59.132
Kill him.

24:01.904 --> 24:04.572
- Cass.
- This child is half-demon and half-human.

24:04.573 --> 24:07.308
But it's far more powerful than either.

24:07.309 --> 24:10.959
Other cultures call this hybrid
cambion, or Katako.

24:11.680 --> 24:14.180
You know him as the Antichrist.

24:25.461 --> 24:27.961
That wasn't me.

24:29.264 --> 24:31.466
Who put that there?

24:31.467 --> 24:35.003
Anyway, I don't get it.
Jesse is the devil's son?

24:35.004 --> 24:37.138
No. Of course not.

24:37.139 --> 24:39.540
Your Bible gets more wrong
than it does right.

24:39.541 --> 24:43.778
The Antichrist is not Lucifer's child,
it's just demon spawn...

24:43.779 --> 24:47.849
...but it is one of the devil's greatest
weapons in the war against heaven.

24:47.850 --> 24:50.918
If Jesse's a demonic howitzer,
what's he doing in Nebraska?

24:50.919 --> 24:54.489
The demons lost him, they can't
find him, but they're looking.

24:54.490 --> 24:57.558
- And they lost him because...?
- Because of the child's power.

24:57.559 --> 25:01.893
It hides him from both angels
and demons for now.

25:02.064 --> 25:04.332
So he's got, like,
a force field around him.

25:04.333 --> 25:06.843
Well, that's great. Problem solved.

25:06.869 --> 25:09.637
With Lucifer risen,
this child grows strong.

25:09.638 --> 25:13.508
Soon, he will do more than just
make a few toys come to life...

25:13.509 --> 25:16.711
...something that will draw
the demons to him.

25:16.712 --> 25:19.212
The demons will find this child.

25:20.015 --> 25:22.817
Lucifer will twist this boy
to his purpose...

25:22.818 --> 25:26.345
...and then, with a word, this child...

25:26.522 --> 25:29.514
...will destroy the host of heaven.

25:29.725 --> 25:33.795
Wait, you're saying
that Jesse's gonna nuke the angels?

25:33.896 --> 25:36.396
We cannot allow that to happen.

25:40.235 --> 25:42.735
Wait.

25:43.272 --> 25:46.982
We're the good guys.
We don't just kill children.

25:48.877 --> 25:54.213
A year ago, you would've done
whatever it took to win this war.

25:54.416 --> 25:56.916
Things change.

26:00.255 --> 26:04.225
Okay. Hey, look.
We are not going to kill him, all right?

26:04.226 --> 26:06.861
But we can't leave Jesse here either.
We know that.

26:06.862 --> 26:10.730
So we take him to Bobby's,
he'll know what to do.

26:10.933 --> 26:13.433
You'll kidnap him?

26:13.502 --> 26:17.305
What is going on in this town, it's what
happens when this thing is happy.

26:17.306 --> 26:21.016
You cannot imagine
what it will do if it's angry.

26:21.610 --> 26:24.011
Besides, how will you hold him?

26:24.012 --> 26:27.902
With a thought,
he could be halfway around the world.

26:28.150 --> 26:30.651
- So we-
- So we tell him the truth.

26:30.652 --> 26:34.555
You say Jesse's destined to go
dark side, fine, but he hasn't yet.

26:34.556 --> 26:37.225
So if we lay it all out for him,
what he is...

26:37.226 --> 26:41.596
...the Apocalypse, everything,
he might make the right choice.

26:48.036 --> 26:50.536
You didn't.

26:51.740 --> 26:54.240
And I can't take that chance.

27:02.751 --> 27:05.251
Damn it.

27:18.567 --> 27:20.101
Sorry. Sorry.

27:20.102 --> 27:22.170
- No worries. You okay?
- Yeah.

27:22.171 --> 27:25.629
It's just, today, a little shaky.

27:25.841 --> 27:29.677
Well, talking to the Winchesters
will do that to you.

27:29.678 --> 27:32.476
Don't you recognize me, sweetheart?

27:32.681 --> 27:35.516
We had so many great times together,
didn't we?

27:35.517 --> 27:38.619
And then you stole something from us,
hid it away.

27:38.620 --> 27:41.646
That was very, very naughty of you.

27:42.858 --> 27:45.226
So we watched, and we waited...

27:45.227 --> 27:49.129
...and now, they told you
where he is, didn't they?

27:49.331 --> 27:52.621
I think it's time we go
and visit our son.

28:30.672 --> 28:34.073
Don't be afraid. I won't hurt you.

28:44.419 --> 28:45.953
Mom! Dad!

28:45.954 --> 28:49.048
Your mother and father are sleeping.

28:49.258 --> 28:52.548
I assure you,
they won't wake until morning.

28:58.533 --> 29:01.033
I'm sorry.

29:08.443 --> 29:11.412
Was there a guy here
in a trench coat?

29:41.376 --> 29:43.344
Was he your friend?

29:43.345 --> 29:45.346
Him?

29:45.347 --> 29:47.847
No.

29:48.884 --> 29:51.384
I did that.

29:52.054 --> 29:54.554
But how did I do that?

29:56.224 --> 29:58.225
You're a superhero.

29:58.226 --> 30:01.059
- I am?
- Yeah.

30:01.229 --> 30:04.365
Yeah, I mean, who else
could turn someone into a toy?

30:04.366 --> 30:08.894
You're Superman,
minus the cape and the go-go boots.

30:12.574 --> 30:14.608
See, my partner and I...

30:14.609 --> 30:17.445
...we work for
a secret government agency.

30:17.446 --> 30:20.916
It's our job to find kids
with special powers.

30:21.283 --> 30:23.951
In fact, we're here to take you
to a hidden base...

30:23.952 --> 30:27.888
...in South Dakota,
where you'll be trained to fight evil.

30:27.889 --> 30:30.999
- Like the X-Men?
- Exactly like the X-Men.

30:32.427 --> 30:36.163
In fact, the guy we're taking you to,
he's even in a wheelchair.

30:36.164 --> 30:37.832
You'll be a hero.

30:37.833 --> 30:40.201
You'll save lives, you'll get the girl.

30:40.202 --> 30:42.702
Sounds like fun, right?

30:46.008 --> 30:48.508
They're lying to you.

30:51.313 --> 30:53.214
Stay right there, dreamboat.

30:53.215 --> 30:55.979
Can't hurt you. Orders.

30:56.184 --> 31:00.518
You, on the other hand,
hurting you is encouraged.

31:05.727 --> 31:08.227
Leave him alone.

31:08.230 --> 31:12.564
Jesse, you're beautiful.

31:13.435 --> 31:15.935
You have your father's eyes.

31:16.204 --> 31:18.704
- Who are you?
- I'm your mother.

31:19.207 --> 31:21.175
No, you're not.

31:21.176 --> 31:25.203
You're half-human, half one of us.

31:25.447 --> 31:27.214
She means demons, Jesse.

31:32.387 --> 31:35.689
Those people you call your parents,
they lied to you too.

31:35.690 --> 31:38.488
You're not theirs, not really.

31:39.728 --> 31:42.029
- My mom and dad love me.
Do they?

31:42.030 --> 31:44.165
Is that why
they leave you alone all day?

31:44.166 --> 31:46.233
Because they love you so much?

31:46.234 --> 31:47.835
These people...

31:47.836 --> 31:51.839
...these imposters, they told you
that the tooth fairy was real...

31:51.840 --> 31:55.009
...and your toys could hurt you,
and things that aren't true.

31:55.010 --> 31:59.140
They love you so much,
they made your whole life a lie.

32:00.348 --> 32:02.848
Look into your heart, Jesse.

32:02.851 --> 32:04.852
You've always known
you weren't theirs.

32:04.853 --> 32:07.254
You've always known
you were different.

32:07.255 --> 32:09.755
Everyone has lied to you.

32:09.791 --> 32:12.291
They're not FBl agents.

32:14.196 --> 32:16.696
And you're not a superhero.

32:17.365 --> 32:19.900
- Then what am I?
- You're powerful.

32:19.901 --> 32:23.370
You can have anything you want,
you can do anything you want.

32:23.371 --> 32:25.881
Don't listen to her, Jesse.

32:25.907 --> 32:29.710
They treated you like a child. Nobody
trusted you, everybody's lied to you.

32:29.711 --> 32:32.211
Doesn't that make you angry?

32:43.391 --> 32:46.155
See? It does make you angry.

32:48.029 --> 32:49.964
But I'm telling you the truth, Jesse.

32:49.965 --> 32:53.234
Wouldn't it be better
if there were no lies?

32:53.235 --> 32:55.336
Come with me.

32:55.337 --> 32:57.304
You can wash it all clean.

32:57.305 --> 32:58.772
Start over.

32:58.773 --> 33:02.436
Imagine it, a world without lies.

33:07.549 --> 33:10.049
She's right. We lied to you.

33:10.252 --> 33:12.762
But I'll tell you the truth. Ugh!

33:13.355 --> 33:18.190
I just- Ugh! I just want to tell- Ugh!

33:18.360 --> 33:20.860
Stop it.

33:20.996 --> 33:23.496
I wanna hear what he has to say.

33:24.065 --> 33:26.565
You're stronger than I thought.

33:29.337 --> 33:33.034
We lied to you, and I'm sorry.

33:33.208 --> 33:35.643
So here's the truth.

33:35.644 --> 33:39.876
I'm Sam Winchester,
that's my brother, Dean.

33:40.115 --> 33:42.016
We hunt monsters.

33:42.017 --> 33:45.186
Except when you are the monster,
right, Sammy?

33:45.187 --> 33:48.389
And that woman right there,
her name is Julia.

33:48.390 --> 33:50.890
She's your mother.

33:50.892 --> 33:55.396
But the thing inside of her,
the thing that you're talking to...

33:55.397 --> 33:56.630
...it's a demon.

33:56.631 --> 33:59.600
- A demon?
He's done nothing but lie to you.

33:59.601 --> 34:02.101
Don't listen to him, punish him.

34:02.170 --> 34:04.670
Sit down and shut up.

34:09.911 --> 34:15.371
There's kind of a war
between angels and demons...

34:15.617 --> 34:18.245
...and you're a part of it.

34:19.487 --> 34:21.655
I'm just a kid.

34:21.656 --> 34:23.924
You can go with her if you want.

34:23.925 --> 34:26.159
I can't stop you. No one can.

34:26.161 --> 34:30.188
But if you do,
millions of people will die.

34:30.398 --> 34:33.000
She said I was half-demon.
Is that true?

34:33.001 --> 34:36.994
Yes. But you're half-human too.

34:37.205 --> 34:39.206
You can do the right thing.

34:39.206 --> 34:41.275
You've got choices, Jesse...

34:41.275 --> 34:46.413
...but if you make the wrong ones,
it'll haunt you for the rest of your life.

34:46.414 --> 34:48.014
Why are you telling me this?

34:48.016 --> 34:53.955
Because I have to believe someone can
make the right choice, even if I couldn't.

35:02.530 --> 35:06.766
Get out of her.

35:19.781 --> 35:21.815
How did you do that?

35:21.816 --> 35:23.717
I just did.

35:23.718 --> 35:28.554
Kid... you're awesome.

35:36.205 --> 35:38.705
Is she gonna be all right?

35:41.343 --> 35:43.843
Eventually.

35:53.122 --> 35:55.622
Look, uh, truth is...

35:56.525 --> 35:59.025
...he's kind of a buddy of mine.

35:59.194 --> 36:00.962
Any way you could turn him back?

36:00.963 --> 36:03.463
He tried to kill me.

36:04.233 --> 36:06.200
Right. Uh-

36:06.201 --> 36:09.431
But he's a good guy.
He was just confused.

36:13.142 --> 36:16.043
Okay. It's been a long night.

36:16.211 --> 36:18.711
We'll talk about it later.

36:20.950 --> 36:23.450
What now?

36:26.488 --> 36:28.489
Now we take you someplace safe.

36:28.490 --> 36:30.858
Get you trained up.

36:30.859 --> 36:33.227
You'd be handy in a fight, kid.

36:33.228 --> 36:35.728
What if I don't wanna fight?

36:35.864 --> 36:38.364
Jesse.

36:43.606 --> 36:45.673
You're powerful.

36:45.674 --> 36:51.840
More powerful than pretty much
anything we've ever seen.

36:52.014 --> 36:54.514
- That makes you-
- A freak?

36:57.886 --> 37:01.322
To some people maybe, but not to us.

37:02.024 --> 37:04.925
See, we're kind of freaks ourselves.

37:06.328 --> 37:08.463
I can't stay here, can I?

37:08.464 --> 37:10.498
No.

37:10.499 --> 37:13.969
Demons know where you are,
more will be coming.

37:16.972 --> 37:19.602
I won't go without my mom and dad.

37:20.509 --> 37:24.878
There's nothing more important
than family, we get that...

37:25.047 --> 37:28.549
...and if you really wanna take them
with you, we'll back your play.

37:28.550 --> 37:33.121
But you gotta understand,
it's gonna be dangerous for them too.

37:33.122 --> 37:34.455
What do you mean?

37:34.456 --> 37:38.292
Our dad, he would take us with him
wherever he went.

37:38.293 --> 37:39.694
Where is he now?

37:39.695 --> 37:41.562
Dead.

37:41.563 --> 37:44.063
A demon killed him.

37:44.633 --> 37:48.535
Look, Jesse,
once you're in this fight...

37:51.206 --> 37:53.706
...you're in it to the end.

37:53.742 --> 37:56.242
Win or lose.

37:56.812 --> 37:58.713
What should I do?

37:58.714 --> 38:01.464
We can't tell you. It's your choice.

38:02.217 --> 38:04.947
It's not fair, I know.

38:07.589 --> 38:10.089
Can I go see my parents?

38:10.492 --> 38:14.895
I, uh- I need to say goodbye.

38:17.866 --> 38:20.366
Sure.

39:23.832 --> 39:26.332
He's been up there a long time.

39:35.544 --> 39:38.044
He's gone.

39:38.180 --> 39:40.680
Where?
- I don't know.

39:40.749 --> 39:43.451
Jesse put everyone in town
back to normal.

39:43.452 --> 39:46.819
The ones still alive. Then he vanished.

39:50.559 --> 39:53.059
Hey.

39:56.064 --> 39:58.564
What does it say?

40:02.571 --> 40:05.606
That he had to leave
to keep his parents safe.

40:05.607 --> 40:08.237
That he loves them, and he's sorry.

40:11.213 --> 40:12.713
How do we find him?

40:12.714 --> 40:15.183
With the boy's powers, we can't.

40:15.184 --> 40:17.684
Not unless he wants to be found.

40:22.991 --> 40:25.491
You think Jesse's gonna be okay?

40:26.628 --> 40:29.128
I hope so.

40:32.000 --> 40:35.870
You know, we destroyed that kid's life
by telling him the truth.

40:37.239 --> 40:39.739
We didn't have a choice, Dean.

40:41.243 --> 40:43.743
Yeah.

40:43.745 --> 40:48.149
You know, I'm starting to get
why parents lie to their kids.

40:48.150 --> 40:51.118
You want them to believe
that the worst thing out there...

40:51.119 --> 40:55.849
...is mixing Pop Rocks and Coke,
protect them from the real evil.

40:56.725 --> 40:59.393
You want them going to bed
feeling safe.

40:59.394 --> 41:02.264
If that means lying to them, so be it.

41:06.268 --> 41:11.433
The more I think about it,
the more I wish Dad had lied to us.

41:13.175 --> 41:15.675
Yeah, me too.
