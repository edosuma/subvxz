WEBVTT

00:58.810 --> 01:00.644
Unh!

01:20.965 --> 01:23.633
At least let me know
who it was.

03:49.713 --> 03:51.282
Clever girl.

06:06.117 --> 06:07.717
You know,

06:07.751 --> 06:09.220
there are other tables
that are cleaned off.

06:09.253 --> 06:10.488
You don't always have to
sit at this one.

06:10.521 --> 06:11.789
Good morning.

06:11.822 --> 06:12.790
The usual?

06:12.823 --> 06:13.924
Yeah. Thanks.

06:13.958 --> 06:15.593
Okay.

06:41.285 --> 06:43.254
<i>Order up.</i>

06:43.287 --> 06:46.557
Well, at least it feels
a little warmer today, right.

06:46.957 --> 06:48.859
So,

06:48.893 --> 06:51.428
did I tell you what my daughter
wants for her birthday now?

06:51.462 --> 06:52.963
A kitten.

06:52.997 --> 06:54.265
What am I going to do
with a kitten

06:54.298 --> 06:55.732
if I'm working 12-hour shifts?

06:56.367 --> 06:58.169
Mind you, I don't want to
let her down, and

06:58.202 --> 07:00.171
I guess her brother could
help her out with a cat,

07:00.204 --> 07:01.872
but lately he's been so...

07:02.907 --> 07:04.909
I mean, he's fine, it's silly.

07:05.309 --> 07:07.478
He's been getting teased because
he can't get past level 10

07:07.511 --> 07:09.146
in Gatekeeper...
it's a video game...

07:09.180 --> 07:10.948
and I keep telling him
they're not his friends

07:10.981 --> 07:12.783
if they won't help him.

07:12.816 --> 07:14.652
Kids are mean.

07:14.684 --> 07:17.288
It's always something, Louis,
it's always something.

07:17.321 --> 07:18.455
I'll be back with
your food, okay?

07:18.489 --> 07:19.890
All right, thanks.

07:34.704 --> 07:35.439
Do you like
humorous books?

07:35.539 --> 07:37.074
Yeah.

07:37.107 --> 07:38.876
Well, I think this one is
going to be a good one for you.

07:38.909 --> 07:39.742
Okay.

07:39.777 --> 07:41.312
Good morning.

07:41.345 --> 07:42.712
Oh, good morning, Louis.
Excuse me.

07:43.948 --> 07:46.684
So, have you finished
your book already?

07:46.716 --> 07:48.219
Fini.

07:48.252 --> 07:50.487
Oh, you melt my heart
with that stuff.

07:50.521 --> 07:52.189
C'est mon plaisir.

07:52.223 --> 07:55.693
Oh, if I was 20 years younger.

07:55.725 --> 07:57.828
Okay, 40. Who am I kidding?

07:57.861 --> 08:00.698
Anyway, I have your next book
set aside for you.

08:00.730 --> 08:01.999
- Oh, great.
- There you go.

08:02.032 --> 08:03.733
Thank you.

08:03.767 --> 08:06.804
And I had a tea I wanted
to share with you...

08:07.037 --> 08:09.707
mmm, but my kettle
stopped working.

08:09.739 --> 08:11.208
Hm.

08:11.242 --> 08:12.742
Oh!

08:13.043 --> 08:15.279
Ginger, a little clove.

08:15.779 --> 08:17.314
Mm-hm.

08:17.881 --> 08:20.718
Guangdong province, maybe.
Kenyan leaves.

08:20.751 --> 08:23.053
Oh, you are good.
Ho-ho-ho.

08:23.087 --> 08:25.789
Oh, my goodness.
You know how they say

08:26.156 --> 08:29.226
certain smells could
unlock the memories

08:29.260 --> 08:30.928
- of a time and place.
- Mm.

08:30.961 --> 08:32.763
Well, I did
travel through Kenya.

08:32.796 --> 08:35.766
- Huh.
- Oh, what a time that was.

08:37.601 --> 08:41.071
Anyway, I was so looking
forward to having tea with you.

08:42.306 --> 08:44.475
Ah, well, it just might be
a short. You got a paperclip?

08:44.508 --> 08:47.278
I do. I do. I do.
Here you go.

08:47.311 --> 08:50.547
Yeah, you can't buy this
in town, I've already checked.

08:53.417 --> 08:54.251
Hm.

08:54.285 --> 08:55.819
Cool.

09:00.858 --> 09:02.393
Voila.

09:02.426 --> 09:03.994
Oh!

09:04.028 --> 09:05.663
You are my hero.

09:05.696 --> 09:06.897
On the house.

09:06.930 --> 09:08.899
Ah, thank you.

09:08.932 --> 09:10.601
And don't forget to put
my secret ingredient in there.

09:10.634 --> 09:12.970
I've got a very special
Balvenie 50 waiting.

09:13.003 --> 09:14.405
- Ooh-hoo.
- Au revoir.

09:14.438 --> 09:16.006
Ooh. Au revoir.

09:33.023 --> 09:35.626
- Hey.
- Hey!

09:37.961 --> 09:39.496
Hey, buddy.

10:20.371 --> 10:21.872
This isn't your work.

10:23.707 --> 10:25.275
Everyone breaks.

10:26.677 --> 10:28.979
I'm going to repeat
the question, Nicolas...

10:52.703 --> 10:54.271
Gotcha.

11:01.044 --> 11:02.613
Hey, there.

11:17.428 --> 11:18.395
Good morning.

11:18.429 --> 11:19.930
Good morning.

11:21.565 --> 11:23.033
Well, you were right.

11:23.066 --> 11:24.803
Definitely caught her
just in time.

11:24.836 --> 11:25.804
She's ready to pop.

11:25.837 --> 11:27.204
Yeah.

11:27.237 --> 11:28.539
I don't think
those kittens of hers

11:28.572 --> 11:29.406
would have survived
long outdoors.

11:29.440 --> 11:30.941
That cover it?

11:30.974 --> 11:32.476
Most people
just put out poison.

11:32.509 --> 11:33.544
Yeah.

11:33.577 --> 11:35.312
Don't want the kittens?

11:35.345 --> 11:36.547
No, thanks. But if you
could save one for Janice

11:36.580 --> 11:38.048
at the diner, that'd be great.

11:38.081 --> 11:39.416
Of course.

11:39.450 --> 11:40.919
See you later.

11:40.951 --> 11:43.720
See you later.

11:43.755 --> 11:45.924
I mean, my son's perfect,
I don't have to tell him

11:45.956 --> 11:47.458
to do a thing.
But Emma?

11:47.491 --> 11:49.726
it's like I have to
whack her over the head

11:49.761 --> 11:52.764
before she'll even listen,
her mind is always elsewhere.

11:53.765 --> 11:57.468
She does have a heart of gold,
though, she really does.

11:58.101 --> 11:59.603
But...

12:00.037 --> 12:01.605
I do my best.

12:01.806 --> 12:03.842
I got something for you.

12:05.609 --> 12:07.444
What's this?

12:07.478 --> 12:11.014
That is the code that will
get your son past level ten.

12:11.048 --> 12:11.783
Gatekeeper?

12:11.816 --> 12:13.684
Yeah.

12:13.717 --> 12:14.685
I was looking into it
last night; all the other kids

12:14.718 --> 12:15.586
are using it too.

12:19.389 --> 12:21.725
You really are a sweet man.

12:27.564 --> 12:28.766
Who's that?

12:28.800 --> 12:30.300
Tony, I think.

12:30.334 --> 12:32.169
He started here a few days ago.

12:32.202 --> 12:34.071
I don't know
much about him.

12:35.038 --> 12:37.174
Um, do you need
anything else?

12:37.207 --> 12:38.977
No, I'm good.

12:39.009 --> 12:40.277
Thank you.

12:40.310 --> 12:41.645
You're welcome.

12:49.019 --> 12:51.188
- Hey, Louis...
- Hey.

12:51.221 --> 12:53.023
There's a man
looking for you.

12:53.056 --> 12:55.225
He came into the shop
and had a photo.

12:55.259 --> 12:56.693
Oh.

12:56.727 --> 12:58.195
And he's been
asking other people.

12:58.228 --> 13:00.631
You didn't tell me
you're a wanted man.

13:00.664 --> 13:02.499
Anyway, I thought you
just might want to know.

13:02.533 --> 13:03.500
Yeah.

13:03.534 --> 13:05.302
Oh, wait...

13:05.335 --> 13:07.137
Him. That's him there.

13:59.656 --> 14:01.191
Jesus.

14:02.994 --> 14:04.561
Who are you?

14:04.595 --> 14:06.096
I'm Dwight Logan.

14:06.898 --> 14:08.432
I'm with the agency.

14:08.900 --> 14:11.501
And I have a message
from Elias Kane.

14:12.402 --> 14:14.404
All right, shut up and drive.

14:14.438 --> 14:16.007
Okay. Okay.

14:47.638 --> 14:49.941
Right, get out.
Into the barn.

14:59.549 --> 15:01.151
Ah!

15:01.351 --> 15:03.021
Unh.

15:32.382 --> 15:35.385
Which one of these numbers
belongs to Elias?

15:35.419 --> 15:36.954
Fuck you.

15:36.988 --> 15:38.990
Try looking under K, asshole.

16:26.436 --> 16:27.972
Empty your pockets.

16:30.808 --> 16:32.810
I'm not
comfortable with that.

16:34.979 --> 16:36.546
Empty.

16:58.468 --> 17:00.004
Have a seat, pal.

17:02.272 --> 17:03.808
Dwight?

17:03.841 --> 17:06.643
Oh, he's fine
if I'm back in an hour.

17:06.676 --> 17:08.246
You didn't trust me?

17:08.278 --> 17:09.914
I don't trust anyone.

17:11.816 --> 17:13.350
You know that.

17:17.420 --> 17:19.090
You still
smoking the Malawis?

17:20.524 --> 17:22.325
Your last one.

17:22.359 --> 17:24.361
Sadly, yes,
but I quit.

17:25.695 --> 17:27.397
It's a hard habit.

17:27.430 --> 17:29.466
No, it's a filthy habit.

17:29.499 --> 17:31.468
The pleasure isn't.

17:31.501 --> 17:34.005
Figure my last breath might as
well have that sweet flavor

17:34.038 --> 17:37.641
running through my lungs one
last time, if given the chance.

17:38.441 --> 17:40.111
Perhaps that time is now?

17:42.213 --> 17:44.115
How'd you find me?

17:44.148 --> 17:46.851
Big Brother's
always watching, Nicolas.

17:46.884 --> 17:50.288
The agency has been scanning
since you went deep.

17:50.320 --> 17:51.621
There was a hit.

17:51.655 --> 17:53.523
I intercepted it
to protect you.

17:53.557 --> 17:54.591
As your friend.

17:54.624 --> 17:56.626
Ah, my friend?

17:57.460 --> 17:59.696
I'm the only one
who came over to your side

17:59.729 --> 18:01.032
after what happened.

18:01.065 --> 18:02.934
I'm still on your side.

18:02.967 --> 18:06.304
Most of your friends want you
dead more than your enemies.

18:09.240 --> 18:10.842
Monica's missing.

18:12.844 --> 18:14.544
Your Monica?

18:14.578 --> 18:16.546
Yeah.

18:16.580 --> 18:18.983
She's hell-bent on finding out
who's behind the assassinations.

18:20.852 --> 18:22.485
She always adored you, Nicolas.

18:23.353 --> 18:25.355
She feels the same way
I do about this,

18:25.388 --> 18:27.691
she wants to know
who's behind it.

18:28.192 --> 18:30.560
I warned her how
dangerous it was.

18:31.195 --> 18:32.897
She's very skilled.

18:32.930 --> 18:35.465
She doesn't have the same
experience we do.

18:35.498 --> 18:37.869
She got too close
and he took her.

18:37.902 --> 18:39.536
Who?

18:39.569 --> 18:41.371
Quentin.

18:41.404 --> 18:43.640
She was onto some lead.

18:43.673 --> 18:45.343
Something he had

18:45.375 --> 18:47.477
that was positive proof
of who set you up.

18:47.510 --> 18:49.512
Who set all of us up.

18:50.680 --> 18:52.449
Any demands?

18:53.284 --> 18:55.019
Nothing.

18:59.090 --> 19:00.724
If Quentin took her,

19:01.691 --> 19:03.261
she's already dead.

19:03.294 --> 19:04.896
I don't think so.

19:06.596 --> 19:07.999
Why come to me?

19:08.032 --> 19:09.699
Where's the agency
in all this?

19:09.733 --> 19:12.103
The agency is all but shuttere
after what happened.

19:12.136 --> 19:14.704
And what good
would they do?

19:14.738 --> 19:17.674
You're the only one who knows
his real identity...

19:17.707 --> 19:19.542
and how to find him.

19:20.144 --> 19:22.947
So, you didn't expose me
because we're friends

19:22.980 --> 19:24.648
or because you need me?

19:26.650 --> 19:28.386
Both.

19:28.418 --> 19:30.420
Nobody knows who Quentin is.

19:31.421 --> 19:33.423
That's what makes him
so powerful.

19:35.226 --> 19:36.426
But he's your guy.

19:36.459 --> 19:37.895
Only through back channels.

19:37.929 --> 19:39.696
That's enough.

19:39.729 --> 19:42.099
Look, we don't know for sure
if he's involved at all,

19:42.133 --> 19:44.534
but Monica found something
that convinced her

19:44.567 --> 19:47.204
he knows the identity
of the assassin.

19:47.238 --> 19:49.240
It's on some digital file
or something.

19:49.273 --> 19:52.043
That was her lead, where to
get her hands on that file,

19:52.076 --> 19:53.643
when she disappeared.

19:59.784 --> 20:02.153
Eight of our friends
are dead.

20:04.454 --> 20:07.091
Someone forced you
to give up their names.

20:12.662 --> 20:14.664
Don't you want
to know who?

20:23.874 --> 20:25.475
Get up.

20:36.821 --> 20:38.389
Let's go.

21:18.029 --> 21:20.031
Jesus Christ.
Does nothing ever change?

21:32.176 --> 21:33.844
For fuck's sakes, Nicolas.

21:37.181 --> 21:39.417
How long you known
my location?

21:39.450 --> 21:40.317
We've known for weeks.

21:40.351 --> 21:41.651
Not you!

21:41.684 --> 21:43.754
The hit was a few weeks ago.

21:43.788 --> 21:45.423
It took some
old-fashioned legwork

21:45.456 --> 21:47.324
to pinpoint you
after that,

21:47.358 --> 21:49.692
all I had was the general area.

21:50.761 --> 21:53.931
This isn't how I imagined
you living your life.

21:53.964 --> 21:57.168
I thought maybe Brussels,
even Buenos Aires.

21:58.969 --> 22:01.604
Which is why I'm here
and not there.

22:01.638 --> 22:04.842
You don't exactly blend into
small-town America, Nicolas.

22:04.875 --> 22:06.343
I don't know.

22:06.377 --> 22:08.345
Louis has made
a lot of friends here.

22:08.379 --> 22:09.847
Louis?

22:11.782 --> 22:14.351
It might be cozy, Nicolas,
but it's not in your blood.

22:15.886 --> 22:18.889
Yeah, well,
Nic Shaw doesn't exist.

22:18.923 --> 22:20.623
You know that.

22:20.657 --> 22:22.226
Not after
what happened.

22:23.127 --> 22:25.396
I'm out of that life, Elias.

22:27.431 --> 22:28.999
Not anymore.

22:32.903 --> 22:35.072
You going to turn me in
if I don't help you?

22:35.106 --> 22:37.475
You'll be helping yourself.

22:37.508 --> 22:39.176
What's done is done.

22:43.114 --> 22:44.982
You know, I should have
been allowed to kill him.

22:45.015 --> 22:46.616
I really should have.

22:46.649 --> 22:48.819
You're lucky he didn't
kill you first, Dwight.

22:48.853 --> 22:50.421
Right.

22:52.756 --> 22:55.625
You're still good,
but predictable.

22:55.658 --> 22:57.228
I told Dwight
all he'd have to do

22:57.261 --> 22:58.996
was be seen
and you'd come to him.

23:00.630 --> 23:02.665
You know, I could still
do the job.

23:02.699 --> 23:04.835
I mean, he is
a fucking traitor.

23:04.869 --> 23:06.270
Enough.

23:09.140 --> 23:10.841
This is your chance
to get your life back.

23:10.875 --> 23:12.776
I told you
I don't want it back.

23:13.043 --> 23:14.644
Fuck Nic Shaw, then.

23:14.677 --> 23:16.313
Fuck the agency.

23:16.347 --> 23:17.848
If you're not going to do it
for yourself,

23:17.882 --> 23:20.317
then I'm asking you
to do it for me.

23:20.351 --> 23:21.785
Help me find my daughter.

23:27.958 --> 23:29.260
- Not with him.
- What?

23:29.293 --> 23:30.861
He's not involved.

23:30.895 --> 23:32.429
- He's good, Nicolas.
- He's careless.

23:32.463 --> 23:33.764
I was trying to be seen.

23:33.797 --> 23:35.332
Talks too much.

23:35.366 --> 23:37.134
Fuck this noise.

23:37.168 --> 23:38.668
Just us.

23:40.703 --> 23:42.173
Okay. Just us.

23:57.588 --> 23:59.089
Serious?

23:59.722 --> 24:01.559
There's plenty
for you to do.

24:11.936 --> 24:13.971
We were never
officially shut down

24:14.004 --> 24:16.373
so I still have access to
back-channel funding.

24:16.407 --> 24:20.077
If there's something we need,
I'm sure I can get it.

24:20.110 --> 24:22.313
Eight in five days.

24:24.215 --> 24:25.715
Unh!

24:28.252 --> 24:31.255
Whoever pulled the trigger
was that goddamn good.

24:36.026 --> 24:37.695
Died on their anniversary.

24:37.727 --> 24:40.598
Don't do it to yourself.

24:40.631 --> 24:45.002
Family can never know the truth.
That's the game we play.

24:45.035 --> 24:47.271
Hell, my ex-wife still
doesn't know her own daughter

24:47.304 --> 24:49.406
is now one of us.

24:49.440 --> 24:51.208
Well, you'd bring Monica in.

24:51.242 --> 24:53.544
She's too smart to be lied to.

24:54.278 --> 24:56.380
Too smart for her own good.

24:56.880 --> 24:58.549
Nicolas,

24:58.582 --> 25:00.551
do you remember anything?

25:00.584 --> 25:02.019
No, not much.

25:02.052 --> 25:04.321
You got away,
you escaped. How?

25:05.389 --> 25:07.758
I don't know.
Memories aren't clear.

25:07.791 --> 25:08.926
Faces?

25:08.959 --> 25:10.494
No.

25:11.061 --> 25:12.730
Pretty sure I was
water-boarded.

25:15.766 --> 25:17.268
I broke.

25:18.902 --> 25:20.571
I gave up their names.

26:00.711 --> 26:03.414
I questioned
a few of her neighbors.

26:03.447 --> 26:05.816
They didn't know her,
they're not much help.

26:05.849 --> 26:07.584
Surveillance?

26:07.618 --> 26:10.354
Yes, but no hit off her phone
or anything else.

26:10.387 --> 26:13.424
No lead other than she believed
Quentin had the information

26:13.457 --> 26:15.025
she was looking for.

26:15.893 --> 26:17.796
So, who is she
in this world?

26:17.828 --> 26:20.297
Name's Rebecca.

26:20.331 --> 26:22.599
Medical technician, single.

26:22.633 --> 26:25.804
Travels half the year
instructing facilities

26:25.836 --> 26:27.871
on how to use
the latest equipment.

26:29.873 --> 26:31.642
Malawi?

26:31.675 --> 26:35.479
Her one vice which, regrettabl
I passed on to her.

26:40.150 --> 26:41.652
Is this really necessary?

26:43.854 --> 26:45.556
I have been through
everything here.

26:59.903 --> 27:01.438
Ah.

27:08.912 --> 27:10.447
Javier?

27:15.686 --> 27:18.689
No one else knew
about her and Javier.

27:19.690 --> 27:21.191
Obviously she's devastated.

27:22.794 --> 27:26.130
She's determined to find out
who's responsible for his death.

27:28.399 --> 27:29.900
Sounds about right.

27:31.535 --> 27:34.505
She reminds me
more of you than me.

28:03.835 --> 28:05.602
He's fresh.

28:05.636 --> 28:07.638
The shooter knew we were coming.

28:08.338 --> 28:10.941
I'm telling you,
we're running silent on this!

28:10.974 --> 28:12.943
Someone in your circle then.

28:12.976 --> 28:15.446
Dwight's the only one involved
and I trust him with my life.

28:15.479 --> 28:17.816
Well, maybe you shouldn't.

28:17.849 --> 28:19.483
Time to leave.

28:19.516 --> 28:21.185
I'll drive.

28:30.994 --> 28:32.996
- So, who else wants us dead?
- I don't know.

28:33.030 --> 28:34.498
The assassin?

28:34.531 --> 28:36.233
Finishing the job?

28:36.266 --> 28:38.168
What if it's Quentin?

28:38.202 --> 28:39.970
What if he not only knows
the identity of the assassin,

28:40.003 --> 28:41.940
but he hired the damned assassin
in the first place?

28:41.972 --> 28:44.241
What if he's behind all
of this from top to bottom?

28:44.274 --> 28:46.176
Monica got too close
and now so are we.

28:46.210 --> 28:48.145
The man's a fucking warlord -

28:48.178 --> 28:51.783
drugs, guns, whatever it takes -
including eliminating whomever,

28:51.816 --> 28:53.517
wherever it gives him
better leverage.

28:53.550 --> 28:56.587
Taking out our team is suicide
he knows that.

28:56.620 --> 28:58.021
Had to be someone else.

28:58.055 --> 28:59.958
Goddamn it,
it doesn't matter.

28:59.990 --> 29:01.592
He's our only connection to
Monica and the assassin.

29:01.625 --> 29:03.494
We got to find him
and stop fucking around.

29:03.527 --> 29:05.462
Doesn't make any sense.
I don't understand why...

29:07.297 --> 29:08.999
What are you doing?

29:10.033 --> 29:11.702
I could use a trim.

29:12.302 --> 29:13.704
Jesus.

29:58.783 --> 30:00.785
Thought you were dead.

30:02.954 --> 30:05.322
How'd you stay under
for so long?

30:05.355 --> 30:06.858
Lucky, I guess.

30:09.693 --> 30:11.930
The killings
shook our world, brother.

30:11.963 --> 30:14.298
Hardly anyone's
come up for air since.

30:15.699 --> 30:17.701
You know why I'm here.

30:19.971 --> 30:23.173
I thought you were the one
who did it.

30:23.206 --> 30:25.542
If it was me, you think
I'd let you touch that .38

30:25.576 --> 30:27.110
in your drawer?

30:38.488 --> 30:40.825
Quentin? That's not his style.

30:41.124 --> 30:43.360
You people were
too valuable to him.

30:43.393 --> 30:44.963
Values change.

30:44.996 --> 30:47.364
Yeah, maybe,
but it doesn't add up.

30:47.397 --> 30:49.299
You know how Quentin works,
all right?

30:49.333 --> 30:50.902
He loves playing
puppet-master.

30:52.003 --> 30:55.073
Yeah, in fact,
there's some chatter

30:55.105 --> 30:57.374
that he's holding
some strings right now.

30:57.407 --> 30:59.109
A prize.
One of yours?

31:00.310 --> 31:01.813
You know where?

31:01.846 --> 31:03.714
That I don't know.

31:03.747 --> 31:07.018
But if she's not dead
then he's using her for bait.

31:07.819 --> 31:09.453
I just need a trim.

31:11.421 --> 31:13.423
He just needs a trim.

31:15.258 --> 31:16.393
Come on.

31:16.426 --> 31:17.962
Huh.

31:22.934 --> 31:25.103
This guy's got a wet mouth.

31:25.135 --> 31:26.236
All right.

31:26.269 --> 31:28.039
And he's an idiot, so...

31:30.140 --> 31:33.443
I'd get to him quickly
before he dries up permanently.

31:34.779 --> 31:36.279
Thank you.

31:36.713 --> 31:38.850
It's a dangerous proposition,
brother.

31:38.883 --> 31:41.618
Well, may be the only way
to clear my name.

31:41.652 --> 31:43.121
You know, some of us
are starting to wonder

31:43.153 --> 31:45.155
if there really is a Quentin.

31:45.790 --> 31:47.759
It's good to see you.

31:50.661 --> 31:52.629
- Hair looks nice.
- Thanks.

32:39.342 --> 32:40.845
Thanks.

33:29.259 --> 33:32.063
Why don't you boys
have a seat, huh?

33:32.096 --> 33:33.663
Mi casa es su casa.

34:13.805 --> 34:14.906
So, you wanna tell me
how the fuck you came

34:14.939 --> 34:16.174
to find me.

34:16.207 --> 34:18.276
We're looking for someone.

34:18.308 --> 34:21.078
That's not the question
I asked, dickhead.

34:21.112 --> 34:23.114
And I was speaking to him.

34:28.119 --> 34:29.653
I don't know you

34:30.121 --> 34:32.123
and I already don't like you

34:32.389 --> 34:34.792
and I sure as fuck
don't trust you.

34:34.826 --> 34:37.829
You come here asking for me
by name in my place of business,

34:37.862 --> 34:40.798
but the fucked-up thing
is that no one knows me

34:40.832 --> 34:43.466
by my name
in my place of business.

34:44.568 --> 34:46.703
The only reason that you
are not dead right now

34:46.736 --> 34:50.308
is because I would like to know
who sent you here.

34:50.340 --> 34:52.109
Oh, I didn't get a name.

34:52.143 --> 34:54.611
Did you get a name of the guy
who sent us here?

34:54.644 --> 34:56.113
You're not gonna answer
the fucking question?

34:56.147 --> 34:57.647
No.

34:59.416 --> 35:00.985
That cigarette
you're smoking

35:01.986 --> 35:04.354
it's made with tobacco
grown in Malawi

35:04.989 --> 35:06.489
near Lilongwe.

35:07.390 --> 35:09.659
It's only sold
in central Africa.

35:11.996 --> 35:13.831
It's a little strange because
I only know a couple of people

35:13.865 --> 35:15.398
who smoke those.

35:16.901 --> 35:18.435
He's one.

35:22.106 --> 35:23.673
This woman...

35:25.408 --> 35:26.944
She's the other.

35:32.515 --> 35:34.751
Yeah, I'd fuck her.

35:34.785 --> 35:36.486
Where is she?

35:36.519 --> 35:39.290
I'm the one
asking the fucking questions.

35:43.895 --> 35:45.528
Yeah! Oh, oh...

35:48.698 --> 35:50.700
What the fuck is this, hm?

35:58.708 --> 36:00.244
No one's coming.

36:00.978 --> 36:03.680
He's very good
at this sort of thing.

36:07.417 --> 36:10.520
Fuck you and fuck you.
Shoot him in the head.

36:10.553 --> 36:12.390
Ah! Fuck!

36:14.258 --> 36:15.927
Fuck!

36:15.960 --> 36:17.627
Did you take her?

36:19.931 --> 36:21.564
Huh? Did you take her?

36:22.432 --> 36:23.968
Yes.

36:25.002 --> 36:26.670
Is she being held?

36:28.571 --> 36:30.107
She's at The Orchard.

36:30.141 --> 36:31.675
What's The Orchard?

36:32.076 --> 36:33.677
It's a processing farm.

36:34.444 --> 36:36.113
You know, like
fucking greenhouses.

36:36.147 --> 36:38.049
100 miles north.

36:38.082 --> 36:39.817
There's a lot of greenhouses
a 100 miles north of here.

36:39.850 --> 36:41.052
It's off 55.

36:41.085 --> 36:42.753
You cannot
miss it.

36:42.787 --> 36:44.322
That is the last place
that I saw her,

36:44.355 --> 36:46.556
I swear to God, swear to God.

36:46.589 --> 36:48.259
It's a fucking game.

36:48.292 --> 36:49.827
They keep her
in one of the greenhouses

36:49.860 --> 36:51.829
and he's waiting
for you to find her.

36:51.862 --> 36:53.463
Who, Quentin?

36:56.968 --> 36:58.501
Yes or no?

36:59.469 --> 37:03.107
Come on, come on, come on,
come on, cowboy, just...

37:03.307 --> 37:05.309
I gave you what you wanted.

37:06.110 --> 37:07.778
Just don't tell anyone
where you got this

37:07.812 --> 37:09.380
because

37:10.114 --> 37:11.782
he will have me killed.

37:12.682 --> 37:14.218
Ah!

37:35.306 --> 37:36.807
Here you go.

37:39.210 --> 37:41.012
You good?

37:41.045 --> 37:42.279
Yeah, good.

37:42.313 --> 37:43.814
I don't like sitting out.

37:43.848 --> 37:46.017
I need your eyes here.

37:46.050 --> 37:47.584
Just like old times.

37:49.020 --> 37:50.520
Yeah, super fun.

40:37.720 --> 40:39.056
I'm going
to take a little break.

41:18.128 --> 41:19.496
Nicolas?

41:19.530 --> 41:20.831
Wha-what are you doing here?

41:20.864 --> 41:22.533
I'm with your father.

41:22.566 --> 41:23.834
Where is he?

41:23.867 --> 41:25.536
He's close. Elias, I've got he

41:25.569 --> 41:27.037
<i>Here she is.</i>

41:28.539 --> 41:29.506
Thank God.

41:29.540 --> 41:31.008
Dad?

41:31.041 --> 41:32.943
It's great to hear your voice,
sweetie.

41:32.977 --> 41:35.246
It's here. I almost had it.

41:35.279 --> 41:36.746
I don't care.

41:36.780 --> 41:37.781
Just get out of there,
they're coming.

41:37.815 --> 41:39.316
Not without the file.

41:39.650 --> 41:41.252
All right. But hurry.

41:47.291 --> 41:48.826
Hold it.

41:53.664 --> 41:55.532
Here, take this.

41:55.566 --> 41:57.101
This way.

41:58.402 --> 42:01.438
<i>The card
will get us into the office.</i>

42:01.472 --> 42:04.275
<i>Okay.</i>

42:19.023 --> 42:20.391
Hey!
Stop right there!

42:20.424 --> 42:22.092
Oh!

42:24.528 --> 42:25.663
We have to
get to the office.

42:25.696 --> 42:26.797
The file is what matters.

42:26.830 --> 42:28.365
Fuck.

42:37.808 --> 42:39.343
Ahh!

42:43.947 --> 42:45.349
In here.

43:02.132 --> 43:04.101
I managed to log on
before they caught me

43:04.134 --> 43:06.136
but I couldn't break
the encryption.

43:08.138 --> 43:09.673
All right, move over.

43:12.409 --> 43:13.977
USB...

43:15.546 --> 43:17.014
Which one?

43:17.047 --> 43:18.582
Top right.

43:24.088 --> 43:25.656
Nice.

43:28.158 --> 43:29.626
Okay, we don't have time
to decode it.

43:29.660 --> 43:31.228
All we need
is the master database.

43:31.261 --> 43:33.731
That's what I'm doing.
I'm downloading it.

43:34.998 --> 43:36.867
All right, we're almost there.

43:45.175 --> 43:47.511
Go, go, go! Move!

43:49.713 --> 43:51.382
Hurry, they're coming.

43:51.415 --> 43:53.083
All right, got it.

44:03.594 --> 44:06.063
Thanks for doing the hard part

44:06.096 --> 44:07.664
What the hell's
the matter with you?

44:07.698 --> 44:10.067
I appreciate the rescue;
it's over.

44:10.100 --> 44:11.668
The drive - now!

44:12.936 --> 44:14.705
<i>Give her the drive, Nicolas.</i>

44:20.477 --> 44:22.045
Give it.

44:26.550 --> 44:28.519
<i>Nice try, Elias.</i>

44:28.552 --> 44:30.053
Fuck!

44:32.990 --> 44:34.491
Let's go.

44:37.127 --> 44:38.662
Hold it. Oh!

44:39.062 --> 44:40.531
Come on.

44:56.280 --> 44:57.849
Ugh!

45:04.154 --> 45:05.722
Go, go, go!

45:06.457 --> 45:07.958
Get in.

45:23.106 --> 45:23.942
Let's go.

45:23.974 --> 45:25.476
Ugh!

45:25.509 --> 45:27.277
Why don't you just
fucking kill me?

45:27.311 --> 45:29.246
Just keep moving.

45:29.279 --> 45:30.782
Come on.

46:03.313 --> 46:04.715
God.

46:07.751 --> 46:09.319
Aw, shit.

46:13.423 --> 46:14.993
Here...

46:18.228 --> 46:19.764
Ah!

47:36.239 --> 47:37.741
All right...

47:42.245 --> 47:43.815
Fuck.

47:46.416 --> 47:47.919
Ohh.

48:03.700 --> 48:05.103
Oh.

48:05.135 --> 48:07.137
Well done, Dwight. Thank you.

48:08.138 --> 48:09.640
How'd he slip away?

48:10.173 --> 48:11.675
How do you think?

48:11.708 --> 48:14.112
He's still better
than any of us.

48:15.345 --> 48:16.914
So, what now?

48:16.948 --> 48:18.649
He's not going to be so
forgiving to her.

48:18.682 --> 48:21.418
If she makes it out,
she knows where to find me.

48:21.451 --> 48:23.186
Is everything else in place?

48:23.220 --> 48:24.789
We're good.

48:39.804 --> 48:41.371
Uh.

48:55.318 --> 48:57.554
The bullet wasn't deep,
you were lucky.

48:57.587 --> 48:59.991
Just try not to move.
I had to burn the wound,

49:00.024 --> 49:02.160
I couldn't find anything
for sutures.

49:02.192 --> 49:03.460
Ahh.

49:03.493 --> 49:05.195
Should've let me die.

49:09.232 --> 49:12.736
I'd like to know
why you tried to kill me first.

49:14.772 --> 49:17.674
I won't give you a chance
to know it's coming next time.

49:17.708 --> 49:20.711
Yeah, I usually know
who my enemies are.

49:21.511 --> 49:23.047
You surprised me.

49:30.353 --> 49:32.723
They're going to see the smoke

49:33.557 --> 49:35.492
Yeah, that's the idea.

50:04.554 --> 50:06.057
What are you doing?

50:32.784 --> 50:34.284
You already have a gun.

50:35.585 --> 50:39.023
I spent my last 15
before we hit the woods.

50:55.940 --> 50:57.875
Give him another injection.

50:58.810 --> 51:00.677
Another injection will kill him.

51:00.710 --> 51:03.713
It doesn't matter
if he doesn't talk.

51:04.816 --> 51:06.416
Give him another injection.

51:09.352 --> 51:11.655
Another injection
will kill him.

51:13.057 --> 51:15.692
What are you
going to do with me?

51:15.725 --> 51:17.327
Wasn't the torture.

51:19.163 --> 51:21.165
What are you talking about?

51:21.731 --> 51:23.733
That's not why I broke.

51:25.069 --> 51:26.636
They drugged me.

51:27.737 --> 51:29.439
You were working with Quentin.

51:29.472 --> 51:31.909
You were going to
take over his operations.

51:32.475 --> 51:34.611
It's why you let him
take out the team.

51:34.644 --> 51:36.147
That's not why.

51:36.546 --> 51:37.949
You had a choice.

51:37.982 --> 51:39.482
You turned.

51:40.051 --> 51:41.585
No. I remember.

51:42.854 --> 51:44.322
My father was onto it.

51:44.354 --> 51:46.958
He was going to
take down both of you.

51:46.991 --> 51:49.659
When you found out,
you gave Quentin the names.

51:53.097 --> 51:54.664
Ahh!

51:56.566 --> 51:58.102
Sodium thiopental.

51:59.270 --> 52:01.239
- Breaks everyone.
- No.

52:01.272 --> 52:04.075
You gave them names
before you were drugged.

52:04.108 --> 52:06.409
Sodium thiopental
creates memory loss.

52:06.443 --> 52:07.979
It can also
be used to brainwash.

52:08.012 --> 52:09.146
If I'm the one
behind it all,

52:09.180 --> 52:10.747
why did I save your sorry life?

52:10.781 --> 52:13.383
Why didn't I kill you
and your father?

52:14.185 --> 52:16.153
When you remember everything,

52:16.187 --> 52:17.721
you will.

52:29.399 --> 52:30.667
These are Quentin's men.

52:34.738 --> 52:36.439
They want you dead too.

52:59.130 --> 53:00.664
Unh!

53:15.079 --> 53:16.646
Fuck.

53:32.997 --> 53:34.597
Fuck.

53:56.821 --> 53:58.389
Hey, Dad.

53:59.223 --> 54:00.758
Guess we should have made
the rendezvous

54:00.791 --> 54:02.559
at the Ritz Carlton. Heh.

54:03.294 --> 54:04.462
Let's get you to a doctor.

54:04.494 --> 54:06.030
No, I'm fine.

54:06.563 --> 54:08.265
Let's just do this first.

54:08.299 --> 54:09.532
Please.

54:09.566 --> 54:11.135
Okay?

54:31.756 --> 54:33.324
There's no data.

54:33.723 --> 54:35.993
I watched him download it.

54:36.027 --> 54:37.527
No,

54:37.762 --> 54:40.563
you thought you watched him
download it.

54:40.931 --> 54:42.400
I saw it.

54:42.433 --> 54:43.633
That's what
he wanted you to think.

54:45.870 --> 54:47.570
He was destroying the evidence.

54:51.242 --> 54:52.742
He knew all along.

54:53.576 --> 54:55.578
He was using both of us.

54:56.579 --> 54:58.149
So...

54:58.182 --> 54:59.850
what do we do now?

55:00.851 --> 55:02.520
We kill Nicolas

55:02.552 --> 55:05.289
before he has a chance
to turn on us again.

55:08.192 --> 55:09.726
Yeah.

55:29.080 --> 55:30.848
Excuse me.
Could I use your phone?

55:30.881 --> 55:32.183
Who the hell are you?

55:32.216 --> 55:33.284
Quick call.

55:33.317 --> 55:34.751
No.

55:34.785 --> 55:36.087
Hey, I got a landline
you can use.

55:36.120 --> 55:37.620
Yeah?

55:37.654 --> 55:39.323
Thank you, man.
Appreciate it.

55:42.493 --> 55:44.095
No shit!

55:44.128 --> 55:45.896
I didn't know
he was going to pay for it.

55:45.930 --> 55:47.431
Don't be an asshole.

55:53.003 --> 55:54.572
You take as long as you want.

55:54.604 --> 55:56.073
Thanks.

56:02.246 --> 56:03.981
Hey, it's me.

56:04.014 --> 56:06.383
I got a book I want to order.

56:06.417 --> 56:08.319
Ready?

56:08.352 --> 56:10.087
It's account number

56:10.121 --> 56:11.489
5549

56:11.522 --> 56:14.125
81222,

56:14.624 --> 56:17.261
Tango, Delta, 5744,

56:18.028 --> 56:19.629
Juliette, Kilo, X-ray.

56:21.365 --> 56:23.134
You got it?

56:23.167 --> 56:24.835
All right, I'll see you soon.

56:26.636 --> 56:28.105
Thanks.

56:28.139 --> 56:29.507
Hey, you need a ride
or anything?

56:29.540 --> 56:30.841
Yes.

56:30.875 --> 56:32.443
Can you give me a lift?

56:32.476 --> 56:33.911
Fuck, yeah.

56:39.216 --> 56:40.885
This can end, Nicolas.

56:42.153 --> 56:43.653
Who is Quentin?

56:44.054 --> 56:45.322
Where is he?

56:45.356 --> 56:46.891
<i>Mister?</i>

56:47.992 --> 56:49.493
Hey, mister...

56:49.960 --> 56:51.195
Hm?

56:51.228 --> 56:52.630
We're here.

56:52.662 --> 56:54.165
Yeah.

56:54.398 --> 56:56.133
Hey, you've already
paid me enough.

56:56.167 --> 56:59.336
Why don't I drive you
all the way into town?

56:59.370 --> 57:01.005
No, I'm good.
Thanks, man.

57:34.838 --> 57:36.840
All right.
Receipt today?

57:37.508 --> 57:38.909
Great.

57:38.943 --> 57:41.212
Here you go, sign that.
Here you go.

57:43.214 --> 57:46.884
Well, look who it is.
What a nice surprise!

57:46.917 --> 57:49.687
Haven't seen you in ages,
I was starting to get worried.

57:49.719 --> 57:51.589
Oh, is there somebody
out looking for me?

57:51.622 --> 57:53.723
No, I can't say there has.

57:55.025 --> 57:57.027
Hey, that book ever come in
that I ordered?

57:57.061 --> 57:59.263
Yes, it did.
Just one minute.

58:01.432 --> 58:02.833
Bye, thanks. Come again.

58:18.382 --> 58:19.883
Here.

58:21.252 --> 58:23.254
That call could have
been intercepted.

58:25.055 --> 58:26.924
I got the right file
from the database

58:26.957 --> 58:28.259
but it still
needs to be decoded.

58:28.292 --> 58:29.760
There wasn't enough time.

58:29.793 --> 58:30.928
I'll do it.

58:30.961 --> 58:32.730
What's on it, Nicolas?

58:32.763 --> 58:35.065
Proof.
Who's behind the hits.

58:35.599 --> 58:38.636
Quentin used this as leverage
to draw us out.

58:38.669 --> 58:40.237
Will it help you?

58:40.271 --> 58:41.772
I hope so.

58:42.573 --> 58:44.575
I got memories
slowly coming back,

58:45.276 --> 58:46.810
little things unlocking like...

58:48.012 --> 58:49.580
sounds and smells.

58:51.081 --> 58:53.784
Like, I remember they drugged me
but nobody asked any questions

58:53.817 --> 58:56.120
about our team members,
only about Quentin.

58:57.421 --> 59:00.491
Somebody gave up their names
but it wasn't me.

59:06.797 --> 59:08.799
Go on, get out of here.

59:10.301 --> 59:11.802
Bad for business.

1:01:10.988 --> 1:01:12.189
Wait here.

1:01:23.267 --> 1:01:24.903
Anything exciting today,
Sheriff?

1:01:24.935 --> 1:01:26.470
I'm heading
over to Montrose.

1:01:26.503 --> 1:01:28.605
They're having a fundraiser BBQ
at The Corner.

1:01:28.639 --> 1:01:31.208
Some of those boys
can get a little excited.

1:01:31.241 --> 1:01:34.311
Then probably head down
to St. Boni for a few days

1:01:34.344 --> 1:01:36.246
afer that, and, you now,

1:01:36.280 --> 1:01:39.149
be back in this area
Thursday, like always.

1:01:39.183 --> 1:01:41.820
Nope. Nothing new.
Just the way I like it.

1:01:41.853 --> 1:01:45.055
Well, some of us wouldn't mind
some excitement around here.

1:01:45.088 --> 1:01:47.057
Daylight savings
starts this weekend.

1:01:47.090 --> 1:01:49.560
Somebody's going to forget
to change the clock.

1:01:49.593 --> 1:01:50.829
Mind-blowing.

1:02:12.616 --> 1:02:14.117
Morning, Sheriff.

1:02:15.118 --> 1:02:16.653
Morning.

1:02:16.687 --> 1:02:18.088
Stay safe out there.

1:02:19.389 --> 1:02:20.524
I appreciate that.

1:02:20.557 --> 1:02:22.226
You have a good day.

1:02:35.138 --> 1:02:36.106
Can I help you?

1:02:36.139 --> 1:02:37.809
Yes.

1:02:37.842 --> 1:02:39.543
Do you know this man?

1:02:40.310 --> 1:02:41.779
Louis.

1:02:41.813 --> 1:02:43.781
Yeah, yeah,
of course I know him.

1:02:43.815 --> 1:02:46.183
Louis and I work together.

1:02:46.216 --> 1:02:49.019
He's not answering his phone and
we're getting a little worried.

1:02:49.052 --> 1:02:51.990
Oh, no, I haven't seen him
for a couple of days.

1:02:52.022 --> 1:02:54.324
Would you happen to have
his address?

1:02:54.358 --> 1:02:57.996
You work with him but you
don't know where he lives?

1:02:58.028 --> 1:02:59.296
No.

1:02:59.329 --> 1:03:01.565
Louis is very private.

1:03:02.533 --> 1:03:05.135
Huh. You can say that again.

1:03:05.168 --> 1:03:07.204
I only see him
when he comes in here.

1:03:07.237 --> 1:03:08.773
Thank you.

1:03:10.040 --> 1:03:12.309
You might ask Irene
at the Village Book Shop.

1:03:12.342 --> 1:03:13.510
Book shop?

1:03:13.544 --> 1:03:14.344
Just across the street.

1:03:14.378 --> 1:03:15.847
He reads a lot.

1:03:15.880 --> 1:03:17.281
Maybe she's delivered
some books?

1:03:18.348 --> 1:03:19.884
I'll do that.

1:04:02.894 --> 1:04:04.461
- Hi.
- Hi.

1:04:04.494 --> 1:04:06.864
- You're Irene?
- That I am.

1:04:06.898 --> 1:04:10.367
Um, I just fixed some tea
if you're interested.

1:04:10.400 --> 1:04:11.702
Buy a book,
and it's free of charge.

1:04:11.735 --> 1:04:13.704
Perhaps another time.

1:04:13.737 --> 1:04:15.305
Okay.

1:04:42.165 --> 1:04:44.668
Another injection will kill him.

1:04:44.701 --> 1:04:46.269
It doesn't matter.

1:04:47.270 --> 1:04:49.941
If he doesn't give up Quentin,
he's useless.

1:05:10.795 --> 1:05:12.696
<i>All but Nicolas.
I need him alive.</i>

1:05:12.729 --> 1:05:13.931
<i>What's the timeline?</i>

1:05:13.965 --> 1:05:15.432
<i>Immediately.</i>

1:05:15.465 --> 1:05:17.035
<i>Move quickly.</i>

1:05:17.068 --> 1:05:18.335
<i>As soon as word reaches
the Agency,</i>

1:05:18.368 --> 1:05:19.837
<i>anyone still alive will go deep</i>

1:05:19.871 --> 1:05:21.839
<i>You'll have
one chance.</i>

1:05:21.873 --> 1:05:24.207
<i>Sounds like
my kind of challenge.</i>

1:05:42.994 --> 1:05:44.461
Actually,

1:05:44.494 --> 1:05:46.831
I'm looking for
a friend of mine.

1:05:47.497 --> 1:05:48.966
Louis?

1:05:49.000 --> 1:05:50.467
Louis.

1:05:50.500 --> 1:05:52.235
Ah, well I know
more than one Louis.

1:05:52.269 --> 1:05:54.204
What's your Louis' last name?

1:05:54.237 --> 1:05:56.406
Does the name Nicolas Shaw

1:05:56.440 --> 1:05:59.177
ring any fucking bells,
old lady?

1:05:59.209 --> 1:06:01.012
You're his gatekeeper.

1:06:01.045 --> 1:06:03.680
Tell me how to get to his house
or I'll put you into the dark.

1:06:03.714 --> 1:06:06.918
Nicolas would never tell
me that. He's far too careful.

1:06:06.951 --> 1:06:08.752
Besides, you don't need to know
where he lives

1:06:08.786 --> 1:06:11.621
'cuz he's coming for you now,
you fucking traitor.

1:06:20.731 --> 1:06:22.232
She's useless.

1:06:22.800 --> 1:06:24.501
Well, he can't be very far.

1:06:24.534 --> 1:06:26.003
Maybe we should just start
checking the houses?

1:06:26.037 --> 1:06:27.504
You think
he'd make it that easy?

1:06:27.537 --> 1:06:28.940
I don't know
with this fucking guy.

1:06:28.973 --> 1:06:30.007
He's got to be somewhere,
though.

1:06:30.041 --> 1:06:31.374
Yeah, he's somewhere.

1:06:48.059 --> 1:06:49.559
Get down!

1:06:51.763 --> 1:06:53.131
Where is he?

1:06:54.766 --> 1:06:56.433
What are finding so funny?

1:06:56.466 --> 1:06:58.468
There's nothing's
We're already dead.

1:06:59.302 --> 1:07:00.838
Fuck that.

1:07:03.808 --> 1:07:04.976
See?

1:07:05.009 --> 1:07:07.145
- Aah!
- No, God.

1:07:07.178 --> 1:07:08.780
Fuck! Aw.

1:07:09.914 --> 1:07:11.414
Ah, God!

1:07:15.685 --> 1:07:17.255
Let's go!

1:07:19.289 --> 1:07:21.092
...the door. This way

1:07:21.125 --> 1:07:22.760
Oh. Ah...

1:07:22.794 --> 1:07:24.162
I'll-I'll call an ambulance.

1:07:24.195 --> 1:07:25.662
Don't.

1:07:29.332 --> 1:07:30.835
Louis!

1:07:31.635 --> 1:07:33.204
Lou... Louis, help!

1:07:39.110 --> 1:07:40.812
- Get up.
- Oh.

1:08:00.463 --> 1:08:01.933
Aw, fuck.

1:08:01.966 --> 1:08:03.134
I know who's behind this.

1:08:03.167 --> 1:08:04.734
I'm sure you do.

1:08:05.169 --> 1:08:06.603
There's a file on my phone.

1:08:06.636 --> 1:08:08.105
I'm going to take it
from my pocket.

1:08:08.139 --> 1:08:09.941
There was no file.
You erased it.

1:08:09.974 --> 1:08:11.575
I memorized the numbers.

1:08:12.176 --> 1:08:13.443
It's decoded.

1:08:13.476 --> 1:08:15.146
The assassin was Fiona Snow.

1:08:16.413 --> 1:08:18.316
Hired by the man
next to her.

1:08:18.348 --> 1:08:21.551
Your father ordered the hit
on Javier and the others

1:08:21.986 --> 1:08:24.454
He was moving in on
Quentin's operation.

1:08:24.487 --> 1:08:26.723
A photograph
doesn't prove anything.

1:08:26.757 --> 1:08:29.126
Listen to the recording.

1:08:29.160 --> 1:08:30.828
You were closing in.

1:08:30.862 --> 1:08:31.963
He was willing
to risk your life to stop it.

1:08:31.996 --> 1:08:33.331
I don't believe you.

1:08:33.363 --> 1:08:35.665
Elias did this to me, Monica.

1:08:37.367 --> 1:08:38.870
Fucking ruined my life

1:08:41.371 --> 1:08:42.940
just to get to Quentin.

1:08:44.175 --> 1:08:46.509
It's the only reason
I'm still alive.

1:08:48.179 --> 1:08:49.713
Just listen to it.

1:08:57.088 --> 1:08:58.655
<i>Move quickly.</i>

1:08:58.688 --> 1:09:00.191
<i>As soon as word
reaches the Agency,</i>

1:09:00.224 --> 1:09:01.691
<i>anyone still alive
will go deep.</i>

1:09:01.725 --> 1:09:03.361
<i>You'll have one chance.</i>

1:09:22.313 --> 1:09:23.814
Ah!

1:09:24.547 --> 1:09:25.950
You okay? Here.

1:09:27.550 --> 1:09:29.387
Here, hold this.
It's okay, it's okay.

1:09:29.419 --> 1:09:30.888
It's okay, it just grazed you.

1:09:30.922 --> 1:09:32.555
Here, just hold that there.

1:09:34.058 --> 1:09:35.625
It's okay, you're just in shock.

1:09:35.659 --> 1:09:37.594
It's all right.
It's all right. I got to go.

1:09:37.627 --> 1:09:39.130
No, no, Louis, please...

1:09:39.163 --> 1:09:40.630
It's okay. I'll be back.

1:09:40.664 --> 1:09:42.233
Ugh.

1:10:23.774 --> 1:10:25.309
Ah!

1:10:26.310 --> 1:10:27.878
Ah!

1:10:28.779 --> 1:10:30.314
Ohh.

1:10:36.020 --> 1:10:37.554
Ah.

1:10:37.822 --> 1:10:39.390
Fuck.

1:11:06.050 --> 1:11:07.584
Glock 17.

1:11:08.651 --> 1:11:10.221
Seventeen rounds.

1:11:14.724 --> 1:11:16.260
I lost count.

1:11:24.101 --> 1:11:26.103
Always loved this time of year.

1:11:31.175 --> 1:11:32.843
Things...

1:11:32.877 --> 1:11:34.445
I will miss.

1:11:35.545 --> 1:11:37.081
Ooh.

1:11:52.196 --> 1:11:53.764
Goddamn it...

1:11:55.399 --> 1:11:58.102
There was never
any gray area with you.

1:11:59.103 --> 1:12:00.771
Right and wrong.

1:12:00.805 --> 1:12:02.373
Black and white.

1:12:03.307 --> 1:12:05.608
The world doesn't work
that way anymore.

1:12:06.377 --> 1:12:08.079
Hell, it never did.

1:12:11.082 --> 1:12:12.950
The line between
shadow and light

1:12:12.983 --> 1:12:14.584
has always been blurred.

1:12:15.786 --> 1:12:17.788
We've always had one foot in,

1:12:18.721 --> 1:12:20.291
one foot out.

1:12:27.398 --> 1:12:28.899
I didn't...

1:12:35.406 --> 1:12:38.409
It wasn't meant to happen
the way it did.

1:12:39.910 --> 1:12:41.479
I thought
I could move merchandise

1:12:41.512 --> 1:12:43.114
without anybody the wiser.

1:12:44.248 --> 1:12:46.917
Operate in both the shadow
and the light.

1:12:49.320 --> 1:12:50.955
Got in over my head.

1:12:52.123 --> 1:12:54.125
It was either them or me.

1:12:55.159 --> 1:12:56.693
And me.

1:13:00.464 --> 1:13:02.032
And you.

1:13:07.771 --> 1:13:10.441
Someday, you'll have to
make a similar choice.

1:13:14.145 --> 1:13:15.678
If you choose differently,

1:13:17.047 --> 1:13:19.049
you're a braver man than me.

1:13:20.217 --> 1:13:22.887
You were never
a brave man, Elias.

1:13:31.495 --> 1:13:33.063
Wait.

1:13:37.468 --> 1:13:39.470
Did you really
have them killed?

1:13:42.739 --> 1:13:44.308
I need to know.

1:13:44.975 --> 1:13:47.311
I can't tell you anything,
Monica...

1:13:49.180 --> 1:13:50.680
other than I'm sorry.

1:13:52.082 --> 1:13:54.385
I didn't ask for an apology.

1:13:55.419 --> 1:13:57.655
I need to know
if it's true

1:13:57.687 --> 1:13:59.689
so that I can kill you.

1:14:03.194 --> 1:14:05.829
There's nothing
I can tell you, Monica.

1:14:08.332 --> 1:14:09.900
I'm sorry.

1:16:10.721 --> 1:16:12.389
You knew it was Elias.

1:16:15.159 --> 1:16:16.727
You could've exposed him

1:16:17.628 --> 1:16:20.331
but you just let him
ruin my life.

1:16:23.967 --> 1:16:28.005
You know why that is, Nicolas.
I had to let it play out.

1:16:29.840 --> 1:16:33.410
Wasn't sure of everyone's roles,
yours included, yes.

1:16:34.178 --> 1:16:37.114
But you did everything
exactly as I thought.

1:16:37.147 --> 1:16:39.049
Mm...

1:16:39.083 --> 1:16:42.152
The world's a dangerous place.
I can't afford to trust anyone.

1:16:43.354 --> 1:16:44.888
Was that one of yours
tried to kill us

1:16:44.922 --> 1:16:46.590
at Monica's apartment?

1:16:50.762 --> 1:16:53.664
It seems this conspiracy
goes deeper than you think.

1:16:54.164 --> 1:16:56.333
Do you really think
this was just about

1:16:56.367 --> 1:16:58.669
Elias working the underground?

1:17:01.004 --> 1:17:02.673
You can do
better than that.

1:17:04.608 --> 1:17:07.177
Melana, you forgot it again.

1:17:07.211 --> 1:17:10.581
You don't want to go home
without that, do you?

1:17:15.386 --> 1:17:18.622
Find your assassin
and you'll find your answer.

1:17:19.791 --> 1:17:21.793
Fiona Snow.
Where is she?

1:17:23.527 --> 1:17:25.797
What do I get in return?

1:17:40.544 --> 1:17:42.045
Bonjour.

1:17:42.746 --> 1:17:44.415
I have it.

1:17:44.448 --> 1:17:46.083
Are we still in the deep?

1:17:46.116 --> 1:17:48.018
This didn't end with Elias.

1:17:48.051 --> 1:17:49.453
<i>You?</i>

1:17:49.486 --> 1:17:51.823
Eyes on her as we speak.

1:17:57.728 --> 1:18:00.731
I'll be away on business
for a few weeks.

1:18:00.765 --> 1:18:02.399
All right. Safe travels.

1:18:04.568 --> 1:18:06.069
All right.
