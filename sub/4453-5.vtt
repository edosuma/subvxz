32:56.149 --> 32:57.282
- Come here.
- What?

32:58.284 --> 33:00.288
(WHISPERING) Don't worry, I hid
yours where he won't find it.

33:00.322 --> 33:02.822
Oh... Thank you.

33:02.856 --> 33:06.120
Janie, I'm sure Mr. Bohannon has better
things to do than to babysit us.

33:07.255 --> 33:09.958
Come now, Janie, keep
your hands off the man.

33:10.393 --> 33:11.626
(CHUCKLES)

33:11.827 --> 33:13.026
Oh, Mr. Bohannon.

33:14.194 --> 33:15.460
Mrs. Strobridge.

33:15.962 --> 33:17.130
Little troublemaker.

33:18.133 --> 33:19.301
Come on, now.

33:19.869 --> 33:21.068
Come on, children.

33:54.398 --> 33:55.898
Mr. Chang want you come.

33:56.366 --> 33:57.664
Most urgent.

34:10.751 --> 34:11.751
(CHANG SPEAKING IN CANTONESE)

34:14.186 --> 34:15.484
I have something to show you.

34:18.185 --> 34:19.418
(CRATE CLATTERING)

34:27.786 --> 34:31.654
A wise man suggested I put my business
(EXHALES) with Thor Gundersen behind me.

34:36.525 --> 34:37.525
Rice?

34:43.134 --> 34:45.833
- How many?
- Enough for an army.

34:47.737 --> 34:49.172
Why you telling me this now?

34:50.842 --> 34:53.677
In the hope that we might put our
past behind us, Mr. Bohannon.

34:54.545 --> 34:56.014
And embrace the future together.

34:58.553 --> 34:59.619
Mmm-hmm.

(DOOR SLAMS)

(PLATE CLATTERS)

35:14.504 --> 35:17.403
Have land values really dropped
so precipitously in Cheyenne

35:17.437 --> 35:19.942
since I set out and moved
the hub to Laramie?

35:20.243 --> 35:22.312
Dog cheap with no bottom in sight.

35:24.846 --> 35:25.845
Good.

35:26.946 --> 35:28.512
- (SCOFFS)
- Start buyin' them up.

35:30.214 --> 35:33.751
What with... With all the free
money my vacant hotel affords me?

35:34.486 --> 35:36.252
I will supply whatever cash you need.

35:37.521 --> 35:39.087
What are you up to, New York?

35:46.262 --> 35:50.432
Laramie is not going to be the hub
of the Union Pacific, Maggie.

35:53.068 --> 35:54.468
Cheyenne is.

35:56.436 --> 36:01.307
Every newspaper article I have read
lately quotes you saying otherwise.

36:01.341 --> 36:04.008
(LAUGHS) Yes, and for once
they've got it right.

36:06.213 --> 36:08.014
News of the hub moving

36:08.683 --> 36:11.585
has sent property prices skyrocketing here.

36:11.620 --> 36:13.855
As they do, we'll sell.

36:14.190 --> 36:16.892
And as they plummet in Cheyenne, we'll buy.

36:18.292 --> 36:21.789
Once we've squeezed the
pig for all its fat,

36:22.524 --> 36:24.891
I will announce I've changed my mind.

36:26.726 --> 36:30.462
Cheyenne will remain as the
hub of the Union Pacific

36:30.496 --> 36:33.528
and you, my dear, will
profit astronomically.

36:34.096 --> 36:35.597
Though hand-in-hand with me.

36:37.767 --> 36:39.967
- Why risk it?
- (LAUGHING)

36:40.635 --> 36:42.068
It's bacon over butter.

36:42.103 --> 36:44.636
You already own all you could ever desire.

36:46.505 --> 36:48.905
I am beginning to think that
you want to get caught.

36:48.939 --> 36:50.339
Oh, hardly.

36:51.605 --> 36:52.705
Almost caught.

36:55.743 --> 36:57.842
You wanna taste death
without swallowing it.

36:57.876 --> 36:59.876
(UTENSILS CLATTER) Can I just say...

36:59.911 --> 37:01.678
You are ruining this steak for me.

37:03.884 --> 37:07.653
You and I, we are insatiable.

37:09.388 --> 37:10.455
We...

37:10.489 --> 37:12.759
We thrive on the hunt. It feeds us!

37:14.295 --> 37:15.327
Us?

37:16.328 --> 37:18.129
From the moment I laid eyes on you,

37:19.332 --> 37:21.269
I knew you were a woman of appetite.

37:24.740 --> 37:26.841
Oh, don't deny it.

Bohannon.

Turn around.

38:02.443 --> 38:03.942
Take me to the rest of 'em.

again, you best get to walkin'.

38:17.721 --> 38:19.990
(SCOFFS) And... Yeah?

38:32.307 --> 38:34.742
You're missing the show, Mr. Bohannon.

38:38.309 --> 38:40.210
- Show me what's in them rice crates.
- Hmm?

38:43.849 --> 38:44.848
Open 'em.

39:09.403 --> 39:10.403
CULLEN: Slow.

39:14.509 --> 39:15.643
Steady now.

39:24.387 --> 39:26.021
- Go there.
- Hmm?

39:29.663 --> 39:31.064

There is no need for bloodshed, brothers.

40:50.749 --> 40:52.081
I want them rifles, Swede.

40:52.116 --> 40:53.684
There are no rifles, Mr. Bohannon.

40:53.718 --> 40:56.121
- Chang told me his self.
- Chang is a liar.

40:56.155 --> 40:57.188
Swede is.

40:57.688 --> 41:00.190
I've never lied to you, Mr. Bohannon.

41:01.160 --> 41:03.894
Why would you trust a Chinaman over me?

41:04.728 --> 41:07.731
A Chinaman whom you have humiliated.

41:07.766 --> 41:10.236
Whose business you have disrupted.
