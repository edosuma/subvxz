00:01.068 --> 00:07.655
reads words on screen

00:26.482 --> 00:28.827
<i>E Block, E108</i>

00:28.827 --> 00:29.482
<i>Maintenance call.</i>

00:29.482 --> 00:31.172
<i>E Block, E108</i>

00:35.862 --> 00:36.758
<i>What was that?</i>

00:41.241 --> 00:42.068
The wall is down!

00:42.068 --> 00:42.758
Come on!

00:43.758 --> 00:44.793
<i>Security to the
gate, west yard!</i>

00:45.655 --> 00:46.689
Come on!

00:58.896 --> 01:00.448
<i>Security to
the west side!</i>

01:02.379 --> 01:03.448
Hurry up!

01:23.206 --> 01:24.482
This is chaos.

01:26.206 --> 01:27.206
Where do we start?

01:28.344 --> 01:30.206
<i>Let's talk
to the Warden.</i>

01:30.724 --> 01:32.517
<i>Good to have you here,
Superintendent Donovan.</i>

01:32.517 --> 01:34.758
Yeah, I wish it was under better
circumstances Warden Kane.

01:35.655 --> 01:36.724
What have we got?

01:36.724 --> 01:37.931
We're looking at
the first prison break-

01:37.931 --> 01:39.689
that's ever gone down
under my watch.

01:40.310 --> 01:41.034
And they went big.

01:42.206 --> 01:43.310
<i>Yeah, well
explosives aren't subtle.</i>

01:44.034 --> 01:45.206
How many do
you think escaped?

01:46.241 --> 01:47.517
Gary?

01:56.620 --> 01:57.413
<i>Okay.</i>

01:57.413 --> 01:58.827
We've identified
the six fugitives.

02:00.758 --> 02:03.241
Four of them have
been recaptured so far.

02:03.241 --> 02:05.620
<i>Alright,
take it easy!</i>

02:05.620 --> 02:06.586
<i>Make that five.</i>

02:06.586 --> 02:09.275
<i>Late twenties,
Caucasian, tattooed.</i>

02:09.275 --> 02:10.034
Blonde mullet.

02:10.034 --> 02:10.965
Not a mullet.

02:10.965 --> 02:11.931
It's a shag.

02:11.931 --> 02:12.931
Are you blind?

02:12.931 --> 02:14.793
Well that narrows
it down some.

02:16.620 --> 02:17.379
<i>Okay.</i>

02:17.379 --> 02:18.931
Yeah, her name
is Selma Tyler.

02:18.931 --> 02:20.758
Okay, so one left.

02:20.758 --> 02:21.655
<i>Yup.</i>

02:21.655 --> 02:22.655
You're looking for-

02:26.793 --> 02:27.793
Jane Pine.

02:32.172 --> 02:33.827
Rex seems to be
on to something.

02:46.344 --> 02:47.482
Okay, be careful Charlie.

02:47.482 --> 02:48.586
Her rap sheet
is stacked.

02:48.586 --> 02:49.965
<i>Assaulting an officer.</i>

02:49.965 --> 02:50.655
<i>Attempted murder.</i>

02:51.103 --> 02:52.137
Criminal mischief.

02:52.137 --> 02:52.793
Okay.

02:52.793 --> 02:53.862
I'll call you back.

03:32.206 --> 03:33.172
Stupid dog!

03:37.344 --> 03:39.896
Actually he's scary smart.

03:46.551 --> 03:47.241
<i>Ow!</i>

03:47.241 --> 03:48.655
It's just a
little sprain.

03:50.034 --> 03:51.034
You think
you could try-

03:51.034 --> 03:52.689
a less agonizing
method of examination?

03:54.482 --> 03:55.344
Jane.

03:56.344 --> 03:57.344
<i>Who planned
the prison break?</i>

03:57.344 --> 03:58.689
Someone who
forgot to invite me.

03:58.689 --> 03:59.793
How do you mean?

03:59.793 --> 04:00.758
<i>I mean-</i>

04:00.758 --> 04:02.103
that I was just playing
cards in the yard-

04:02.103 --> 04:02.793
minding my own business.

04:02.793 --> 04:03.482
And then boom!

04:03.482 --> 04:04.172
The wall goes down.

04:05.310 --> 04:06.551
You hadn't heard there
would be an escape attempt?

04:06.551 --> 04:08.241
Warden if I'd known
what was going down-

04:08.241 --> 04:10.310
I think I would have came
up with a little better plan-

04:10.310 --> 04:11.896
than getting stuck
inside the drain pipe.

04:11.896 --> 04:13.000
<i>But I mean hey.</i>

04:13.000 --> 04:14.517
<i>When you see your shot,
you've got to take it.</i>

04:15.344 --> 04:16.034
YOLO, baby.

04:16.034 --> 04:16.689
Ow!

04:16.689 --> 04:17.862
<i>Cripes!</i>

04:27.793 --> 04:29.034
So you believe her?

04:29.034 --> 04:31.310
It's consistent with the
other escapees' stories.

04:31.620 --> 04:33.724
If there was a plan,
no one knew about it.

04:36.965 --> 04:39.206
<i>Sorry, do you
think she needs a splint?</i>

04:39.310 --> 04:40.586
Oh, the tape
will suffice.

04:41.034 --> 04:42.275
You can take
her back now.

04:42.931 --> 04:43.689
Really?

04:46.793 --> 04:49.068
Inmates exaggerate
their injuries-

04:49.068 --> 04:50.551
simply to obtain drugs.

04:50.551 --> 04:51.620
I see it
all the time.

04:51.620 --> 04:53.482
Were there others injured?

04:53.482 --> 04:54.931
Oh, not in
the blast.

04:54.931 --> 04:57.448
A few cuts and scrapes
on the ones who ran.

04:57.448 --> 04:58.689
Barely worth
a Band-aid.

04:58.793 --> 04:59.724
Hmm.

05:32.758 --> 05:33.517
Yeah I see it.

05:38.896 --> 05:40.172
Looks like a
blasting cap.

05:40.689 --> 05:41.586
Good job, pal.

05:46.689 --> 05:47.413
What else you got?

06:03.344 --> 06:05.000
Scrolling on the job
there, Superintendent?

06:05.000 --> 06:07.137
Actually I'm just
returning a text message.

06:07.137 --> 06:07.827
So just-

06:08.344 --> 06:09.827
just mind your
business Jesse.

06:09.827 --> 06:11.275
Sure sure!

06:15.241 --> 06:16.413
Did you match with
someone on Sifter?

06:17.517 --> 06:19.310
Why don't you just look
at the security footage?

06:19.310 --> 06:20.379
Rewind it a
couple of times.

06:20.379 --> 06:21.413
And I'll get
back to you.

06:21.413 --> 06:22.103
Already did.

06:22.103 --> 06:23.482
Is it anyone special?

06:24.931 --> 06:26.517
Actually I'm really
excited about this one.

06:27.448 --> 06:28.827
Hey that's great!

06:28.827 --> 06:29.758
Have you met IRL?

06:31.068 --> 06:31.724
IRL?

06:32.103 --> 06:33.310
IRL.

06:33.310 --> 06:34.034
Uh-

06:34.517 --> 06:35.310
No.

06:36.413 --> 06:37.482
Well if you haven't
met offline-

06:37.482 --> 06:38.586
then can you
really be sure?

06:39.379 --> 06:40.034
You know what?

06:40.034 --> 06:41.034
We've got work
to do Jesse.

06:41.034 --> 06:42.689
Just forget
about it okay?

06:42.689 --> 06:43.620
Okay.

06:47.034 --> 06:48.551
I mean, if you want
my honest opinion-

06:48.551 --> 06:49.241
Just-

06:50.586 --> 06:51.517
Sarah.

06:52.103 --> 06:53.137
Forensics findings?

06:53.137 --> 06:54.379
<i>Uh yeah.</i>

06:54.379 --> 06:57.034
The rubble's propulsion
trajectory indicates-

06:57.034 --> 07:00.137
the bomb was set inside the
prison yard near the fence.

07:00.137 --> 07:02.965
<i>Where there's a
woeful lack of CCTV coverage.</i>

07:02.965 --> 07:04.689
Yeah, which is probably why the
bomber chose that location.

07:04.689 --> 07:05.724
<i>It's also
the furthest corner-</i>

07:05.724 --> 07:06.931
of the yard.

07:06.931 --> 07:08.344
The bomber might have been
trying to avoid casualties.

07:08.344 --> 07:11.103
Okay, so if the bomber wasn't
trying to hurt anyone-

07:11.103 --> 07:13.068
And there was no
plan for mass escape-

07:13.068 --> 07:14.724
Then what was
the objective?

07:14.724 --> 07:16.275
Yeah and who
was the bomber?

07:16.275 --> 07:17.965
Well Rex didn't
detect the scent-

07:17.965 --> 07:20.172
<i>of any accelerants on
any of the escapees.</i>

07:21.275 --> 07:23.517
How did they get the components
to construct a bomb?

07:23.517 --> 07:25.103
If someone knew
what they were doing-

07:25.103 --> 07:26.896
they could have used substances
commonly found in the prison.

07:26.896 --> 07:27.586
Really?

07:27.586 --> 07:28.931
Like what?

07:28.931 --> 07:30.793
Toilet cleaner contains
sodium bisulphate.

07:30.793 --> 07:32.758
Sodium nitrate
is in curing salt.

07:32.758 --> 07:34.896
Ammonia from
household disinfectant.

07:34.896 --> 07:35.793
You mix them
all together-

07:35.793 --> 07:36.827
and you get
ammonium nitrate.

07:36.827 --> 07:37.827
And-
ka-boom.

07:38.586 --> 07:39.758
<i>What about the
blasting cap though?</i>

07:39.758 --> 07:41.655
That's definitely
not prison issue.

07:41.655 --> 07:43.310
It's the same type
used in fireworks.

07:43.310 --> 07:44.724
A remote detonator
would have been needed-

07:44.724 --> 07:45.620
to set it off.

07:45.620 --> 07:46.862
But we couldn't
find it.

07:47.172 --> 07:48.379
The Canada Day Bomber?

07:48.931 --> 07:49.724
Well, the same MO.

07:49.724 --> 07:50.551
<i>Yeah,
but that was-</i>

07:50.551 --> 07:51.241
what?

07:51.241 --> 07:52.206
Fifteen years ago?

07:52.206 --> 07:53.275
<i>Yeah,
but I remember it-</i>

07:53.275 --> 07:54.068
like it was yesterday.

07:54.068 --> 07:55.758
Well I mean,
I don't.

07:57.206 --> 07:58.448
Okay here, yeah.

07:59.000 --> 08:00.689
<i>In a daring
2007 heist-</i>

08:00.689 --> 08:03.241
<i>thieves blasted open
the Union Bank Vault.</i>

08:03.241 --> 08:04.689
<i>And the bomb's
detonation was set</i>

08:04.689 --> 08:05.862
<i>to coincide with
Canada Day fireworks-</i>

08:05.965 --> 08:07.379
masking the explosion.

08:08.103 --> 08:09.551
That's actually
pretty genius.

08:09.655 --> 08:11.517
<i>Well the genius
that thought of it-</i>

08:11.517 --> 08:13.275
is sentenced to life.

08:13.275 --> 08:14.655
<i>Which she's serving here-</i>

08:14.655 --> 08:17.000
at the Iron Port Penitentiary.

08:21.793 --> 08:23.655
Wanda June Reilly?

08:23.655 --> 08:24.344
<i>Yeah.</i>

08:25.172 --> 08:26.137
Detective Hudson.

08:27.517 --> 08:28.275
That's my partner, Rex.

08:28.275 --> 08:30.344
This is Dr.
Sarah Truong.

08:31.275 --> 08:33.034
Nice to meet
you, Rex.

08:33.034 --> 08:33.689
Oh my.

08:35.103 --> 08:36.206
What's the matter, boy?

08:36.206 --> 08:38.310
Well that is his
friendly way of saying-

08:38.310 --> 08:40.172
you have explosives
residue on your hands.

08:40.172 --> 08:41.655
<i>Really?</i>

08:41.655 --> 08:42.482
<i>Who's a good boy?</i>

08:43.655 --> 08:45.241
<i>Rex is a
good boy!</i>

08:45.241 --> 08:46.206
<i>Yes you are!</i>

08:46.724 --> 08:49.448
Are you admitting
you set the bomb?

08:49.448 --> 08:50.655
Nah.

08:51.241 --> 08:54.000
I'm admitting Rex is a
heck of a sniffer dog.

08:54.000 --> 08:56.482
I partnered with a
shepherd back in the day.

08:56.482 --> 08:57.724
Yeah, in
the Gulf War.

08:57.724 --> 08:59.689
<i>You were a
decorated soldier.</i>

08:59.689 --> 09:02.379
<i>Canadian Forces.</i>

09:02.379 --> 09:04.896
Explosive Ordinance
Disposal Technician.

09:04.896 --> 09:06.551
Is that how you
got injured?

09:07.103 --> 09:07.758
No.

09:07.758 --> 09:09.620
I came back
in one piece.

09:09.620 --> 09:11.379
Got this place to thank
for losing my toes.

09:11.379 --> 09:13.103
So you retired
from the service-

09:13.103 --> 09:14.413
and you started
blowing up banks?

09:14.413 --> 09:15.379
Yeah.

09:15.379 --> 09:16.413
Good times.

09:16.413 --> 09:18.793
Ah, well the bomb that
went off here today-

09:18.793 --> 09:20.724
it had some similarities
to the one that you used-

09:20.724 --> 09:21.689
in the Canada Day heist.

09:22.517 --> 09:24.103
Could be a copycat.

09:24.103 --> 09:26.793
Imitation's the sincerest
form of flattery.

09:38.241 --> 09:40.103
It's a fireworks detonator.

09:40.724 --> 09:41.793
Whoopsy.

09:41.793 --> 09:43.103
You got me Rex.

09:46.275 --> 09:48.068
So you blasted
through the wall.

09:48.068 --> 09:49.379
But you didn't
try and escape.

09:49.379 --> 09:50.068
Why?

09:50.068 --> 09:52.310
Escape-shmeshcape.

09:52.310 --> 09:53.586
I was bored.

09:53.586 --> 09:55.137
You've got to
shake things up.

09:55.137 --> 09:57.413
Or your mind
turns to mush.

09:57.413 --> 09:58.551
What have I
got to lose?

09:58.551 --> 10:00.655
Any chance
of parole?

10:00.655 --> 10:02.241
<i>Maybe I
don't want parole.</i>

10:02.241 --> 10:04.137
Maybe I'm happy with
three hots and a cot-

10:04.137 --> 10:05.517
for the rest
of my life.

10:10.482 --> 10:12.379
I'm not buying
her explanation.

10:12.379 --> 10:13.931
She had to have
some other motive.

10:14.482 --> 10:15.275
I agree.

10:15.379 --> 10:16.482
But she did confess.

10:16.482 --> 10:17.965
All the escapees
have been recaptured.

10:17.965 --> 10:19.448
So our work
here is done.

10:19.448 --> 10:21.206
<i>Superintendent!</i>

10:23.413 --> 10:24.758
I'm glad I
caught you.

10:24.758 --> 10:25.620
We were just
wrapping up.

10:25.620 --> 10:26.310
What's up, Warden?

10:26.310 --> 10:27.793
We did a
head count.

10:27.793 --> 10:29.793
And two of the inmates
are unaccounted for.

10:29.896 --> 10:32.344
I checked the security
footage dozens of times.

10:32.344 --> 10:33.793
No one else went
through that back wall.

10:35.206 --> 10:36.758
Because they didn't
go out with the others.

10:38.413 --> 10:40.827
The bomb was
a diversion.

10:40.827 --> 10:43.586
And now they've got
a huge head start.

10:52.517 --> 10:53.310
<i>All right people!</i>

10:53.310 --> 10:54.068
<i>Bring it in.</i>

10:56.862 --> 10:58.689
I've issued an APB.

10:58.689 --> 11:01.448
And all airports and ferry
terminals have been notified-

11:01.448 --> 11:03.517
to be on the lookout
for Vicky Gumble-

11:03.517 --> 11:05.275
and Valerie Winehouse.

11:05.275 --> 11:06.344
They're convicted murderers.

11:06.344 --> 11:08.310
Only one worked
for the SJPD.

11:08.310 --> 11:10.034
I mean it's so weird
I used to see Vicky-

11:10.034 --> 11:11.758
every time I went
down into archives.

11:12.724 --> 11:14.206
<i>She fabricated evidence-</i>

11:14.206 --> 11:15.758
in that murder
case, right?

11:15.758 --> 11:16.724
Yeah.

11:16.724 --> 11:17.724
And then she killed
her fellow officer-

11:17.724 --> 11:18.827
who threatened
to expose her.

11:18.827 --> 11:20.862
She's a smart,
manipulative criminal.

11:20.862 --> 11:22.000
And never showed
any remorse.

11:22.000 --> 11:23.620
Yeah, which is why she
was serving a life sentence-

11:23.620 --> 11:24.310
when she escaped.

11:25.344 --> 11:26.689
What about Valerie Winehouse?

11:26.689 --> 11:27.379
I don't know.

11:27.379 --> 11:28.551
That name sounds familiar.

11:28.551 --> 11:29.827
Yeah, here.

11:29.827 --> 11:32.655
Valerie Winehouse pled guilty to
the murder of her boyfriend.

11:32.655 --> 11:34.620
<i>Oh, her
sentencing was lenient.</i>

11:34.620 --> 11:36.275
Yeah, well due to her
boyfriend's documented history-

11:36.275 --> 11:37.000
of abuse against her.

11:37.620 --> 11:38.827
It looks like her parole-

11:38.827 --> 11:40.586
<i>was scheduled
for next month?</i>

11:40.586 --> 11:41.965
<i>If she was so
close to freedom-</i>

11:41.965 --> 11:43.241
why make a
break for it now?

11:43.241 --> 11:45.310
Jesse, did Vicky and
Valerie know each other-

11:45.310 --> 11:46.344
<i>outside of prison?</i>

11:46.344 --> 11:47.310
<i>Are they related?</i>

11:47.310 --> 11:48.275
<i>Were they cellmates?</i>

11:48.275 --> 11:49.758
<i>Oh, I see
where you're going.</i>

11:49.758 --> 11:50.758
<i>Abusive relationships happen-</i>

11:50.758 --> 11:52.000
behind bars too.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.034
Maybe Vicky coerced Valerie
into doing something stupid.

11:54.034 --> 11:55.758
And how did they get out
without anyone seeing them?

11:55.862 --> 11:56.724
You know what?

11:56.724 --> 11:57.448
I'll show you.

11:58.344 --> 11:59.000
Here.

12:03.448 --> 12:04.448
Look at this.

12:09.137 --> 12:10.586
<i>Vicky and Valerie.</i>

12:11.000 --> 12:11.724
You were right.

12:11.724 --> 12:12.724
The bomb was
just a diversion.

12:12.724 --> 12:14.793
They walked out right
under our noses.

12:14.793 --> 12:15.862
Of course!

12:15.862 --> 12:17.000
We were looking for
prisoners not paramedics!

12:18.172 --> 12:19.827
Yeah, I know pal.

12:19.827 --> 12:20.931
They wouldn't
have fooled you.

12:20.931 --> 12:22.551
How did they
get uniforms?

12:22.551 --> 12:24.206
Probably the same place
they got the explosives.

12:28.034 --> 12:28.793
Joe Donovan.

12:28.793 --> 12:30.965
They had to have
an outside source-

12:30.965 --> 12:32.862
smuggling contraband
into the prison.

12:33.586 --> 12:35.931
Jesse, can you pull up the
prison phone records-

12:35.931 --> 12:38.000
<i>see who the fugitives
were talking to-</i>

12:38.000 --> 12:39.068
<i>leading up to
the bombing?</i>

12:39.068 --> 12:39.896
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

12:39.896 --> 12:41.482
Yeah, we've got
to get on the move.

12:41.482 --> 12:43.655
These two get further and
further away every second.

12:45.724 --> 12:46.448
Apparently not.

12:46.448 --> 12:47.689
<i>They just
robbed a store-</i>

12:47.689 --> 12:49.000
on Water Street.

12:53.551 --> 12:54.655
<i>The store
was closed.</i>

12:54.655 --> 12:56.275
I was having a smoke
before my shift.

12:56.758 --> 12:57.931
When I came
back in-

12:57.931 --> 12:59.517
they ambushed me.

12:59.517 --> 13:00.517
There was a struggle?

13:01.206 --> 13:02.344
Not really.

13:02.344 --> 13:05.517
It's hard to fight with
a knee in your neck.

13:05.517 --> 13:07.137
That woman knew
what she was doing.

13:07.724 --> 13:08.517
I'm not surprised.

13:08.517 --> 13:09.793
She's an ex
police officer.

13:09.793 --> 13:10.689
What happened next?

13:10.793 --> 13:13.000
They gagged me and
tied me to Martha.

13:13.724 --> 13:14.724
Martha?

13:16.103 --> 13:16.965
<i>They locked
me in a-</i>

13:16.965 --> 13:19.689
<i>rather intimate
pose with her-</i>

13:19.689 --> 13:23.241
and left me spinning while
they robbed the place.

13:24.137 --> 13:25.896
I'm still kind
of nauseous.

13:34.862 --> 13:36.000
<i>What have you got, pal?</i>

13:40.586 --> 13:42.172
Did it seem like
they were on drugs?

13:42.172 --> 13:43.000
Nah.

13:43.000 --> 13:44.034
They seemed normal.

13:44.413 --> 13:46.413
If you can call tying
me to a mannequin-

13:46.413 --> 13:47.896
and going on
a spree normal.

13:47.896 --> 13:48.724
A spree?

13:48.724 --> 13:49.413
<i>Yeah.</i>

13:49.413 --> 13:50.413
<i>See for yourself.</i>

13:50.413 --> 13:51.413
It's all on tape.

13:58.482 --> 13:59.758
They're really
taking their time.

13:59.758 --> 14:02.206
Well I mean it's like they're
not afraid of getting caught.

14:02.206 --> 14:04.689
Yeah this is not your
average prison break.

14:07.206 --> 14:08.310
Oh Charlie.

14:08.310 --> 14:09.655
Did you get anything from
the prison phone records-

14:09.655 --> 14:10.413
I pulled for you?

14:10.413 --> 14:11.620
Yeah a couple of
things actually.

14:11.620 --> 14:12.793
From what
I can tell-

14:12.793 --> 14:13.482
Vicky's been calling-

14:13.482 --> 14:15.517
relatives of fellow inmates.

14:15.517 --> 14:17.862
And one of their
names rang a bell.

14:19.068 --> 14:21.068
He should be here any
minute for an interview.

14:21.068 --> 14:22.000
Come on pal.

14:29.448 --> 14:30.689
Thanks for
coming in, Buck.

14:30.689 --> 14:32.896
You helped us with that treasure
hunter murder last year, right?

14:33.724 --> 14:35.517
Yeah you ever
catch that guy?

14:35.517 --> 14:36.724
<i>Yeah, we sure did.</i>

14:36.724 --> 14:38.000
We appreciate
the assist on that.

14:38.000 --> 14:38.827
Have a seat.

14:41.103 --> 14:43.241
Um- listen.

14:43.241 --> 14:44.724
I need to ask you
a couple questions-

14:44.724 --> 14:46.413
about your wife-

14:46.413 --> 14:48.000
I don't talk
about that much.

14:49.000 --> 14:50.724
I lost Delia
to prison.

14:51.000 --> 14:52.758
Then I lost her
to a sickle cell.

14:52.758 --> 14:54.482
The disease killed her?

14:54.482 --> 14:56.068
The pain
got so bad.

14:57.758 --> 14:59.965
The meds they were giving her in
prison weren't strong enough.

15:01.862 --> 15:04.172
So she asked for
medically-assisted suicide.

15:05.482 --> 15:06.862
I'm sorry.

15:07.620 --> 15:08.862
I can't blame
her, though.

15:08.862 --> 15:11.413
She wasn't having
any kind of life.

15:14.586 --> 15:15.344
<i>Buck.</i>

15:16.137 --> 15:17.862
How do you know
Vicky Gumble?

15:19.379 --> 15:21.172
She would call me
with messages-

15:21.172 --> 15:24.137
whenever Delia was too
weak to come to the phone.

15:24.137 --> 15:25.862
What kind of messages?

15:26.827 --> 15:28.034
<i>Oh, you know.</i>

15:28.034 --> 15:29.310
I love you.

15:30.241 --> 15:31.379
I miss you.

15:33.034 --> 15:35.551
I wish I could be there to
help you through all of this.

15:38.344 --> 15:40.275
<i>It's me that should
have been there for her.</i>

15:43.965 --> 15:45.758
Vicky Gumble was there-

15:46.517 --> 15:48.068
looking after Delia
when I wasn't.

15:48.068 --> 15:51.586
And she never asked you
for anything in return?

15:53.413 --> 15:55.068
I know what you're
getting at, Detective.

15:55.931 --> 15:57.931
Vicky Gumble never
asked me for a thing.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.689
She was just there to listen
when I needed a friend.

16:11.034 --> 16:12.586
<i>More messages
from your Sifter crush?</i>

16:13.689 --> 16:15.344
What I wanted to tell you
before about online dating-

16:15.344 --> 16:16.034
Oh God.

16:16.034 --> 16:17.241
Don't get
too invested.

16:17.241 --> 16:19.275
You can't really know someone
until you've actually met.

16:19.275 --> 16:20.034
<i>Uh, Jesse.</i>

16:20.862 --> 16:22.206
I know all about catfishing.

16:22.206 --> 16:22.862
<i>Okay?</i>

16:22.862 --> 16:23.965
<i>I do, and look.</i>

16:23.965 --> 16:25.620
We've been talking online
for over two weeks now.

16:25.620 --> 16:26.965
I'm not talking
about catfishing.

16:26.965 --> 16:28.103
<i>Here's the thing.</i>

16:28.103 --> 16:29.103
<i>Joe.</i>

16:29.103 --> 16:31.241
You don't want to go in
too deep prematurely.

16:31.241 --> 16:32.344
See-

16:32.344 --> 16:34.103
online chemistry is
different than in real life.

16:34.103 --> 16:35.689
Please learn
from my mistakes.

16:35.689 --> 16:36.379
Right.

16:36.379 --> 16:37.344
Because- you're the expert?

16:38.655 --> 16:39.965
I can definitely coach you on
what not to do on a first date.

16:41.103 --> 16:42.310
Okay, uhhh-

16:42.310 --> 16:44.344
Jesse, I really appreciate
all of your concern.

16:44.344 --> 16:45.310
But um-

16:46.137 --> 16:46.931
I'm good.

16:53.344 --> 16:54.172
<i>Vicky Gumble's calls-</i>

16:54.172 --> 16:56.103
specifically targeted
the loved ones-

16:56.103 --> 16:59.586
of sick or
deceased inmates?

16:59.586 --> 17:00.517
Mm-hmm.

17:00.517 --> 17:02.379
Expressing condolences.

17:02.379 --> 17:05.034
Or updating families
on conditions.

17:05.034 --> 17:08.172
She's gone from cop killer
to prisoner advocate?

17:09.310 --> 17:11.517
Vicky Gumble's never advocated
for anybody but herself.

17:11.517 --> 17:12.206
Come on.

17:12.206 --> 17:13.000
People can change.

17:13.000 --> 17:14.344
I'll believe that
when I see it.

17:16.689 --> 17:18.068
That smells very good.

17:18.172 --> 17:19.310
Mm-hmm!

17:19.413 --> 17:21.379
Porcini and chestnut consommé.

17:21.379 --> 17:22.068
Wow!

17:22.068 --> 17:23.275
Aren't we posh?

17:23.275 --> 17:24.896
Well I know that
you've been-

17:24.896 --> 17:27.827
missing your fancy
restaurants in Toronto.

17:27.827 --> 17:28.965
And now-

17:28.965 --> 17:30.000
there's just-

17:30.000 --> 17:30.965
one last step.

17:30.965 --> 17:32.517
Have you used
that before?

17:35.689 --> 17:36.344
<i>What?</i>

17:37.344 --> 17:38.379
Oh you don't think I
can't handle it, huh?

17:38.379 --> 17:40.137
Those can be tricky.

17:40.137 --> 17:40.931
Can I help you?

17:40.931 --> 17:43.034
Yes, absolutely.

17:47.137 --> 17:48.275
But not with
the cooking.

17:48.275 --> 17:48.965
<i>Okay.</i>

17:48.965 --> 17:49.620
<i>So sit.</i>

17:49.620 --> 17:50.655
<i>Sit sit.</i>

17:50.655 --> 17:52.000
Drink your wine.

17:52.724 --> 17:53.379
There you go.

17:53.379 --> 17:54.241
Have some more.

17:54.241 --> 17:55.758
And I've got
this handled.

18:00.655 --> 18:04.103
The shop owner posted the
footage of the robbery online.

18:04.103 --> 18:05.137
Oh boy.

18:05.137 --> 18:05.931
What?

18:07.448 --> 18:08.275
What is it?

18:08.862 --> 18:10.448
It looks like someone
had fun with it.

18:16.275 --> 18:17.103
<i>Well you know what?</i>

18:17.103 --> 18:18.793
This may not
actually be that bad-

18:18.793 --> 18:21.517
because it's publicity
like this that is going to-

18:21.517 --> 18:22.448
<i>make it very difficult-</i>

18:22.448 --> 18:24.310
<i>for them to
go anywhere-</i>

18:24.310 --> 18:25.551
without being recognized.

18:25.551 --> 18:26.793
Yeah, well this is
obviously defective.

18:26.793 --> 18:28.172
I think the button's
on the other side.

18:30.551 --> 18:31.965
Detective Hudson.

18:33.344 --> 18:34.379
Where?

18:35.931 --> 18:36.793
I'm on it.

18:37.448 --> 18:38.206
What's up?

18:38.206 --> 18:39.655
Robbery in
progress at Choo.

18:41.344 --> 18:43.103
Vicky and Valerie
may be there.

18:43.517 --> 18:44.448
Okay go.

18:45.034 --> 18:45.655
Um.

18:45.655 --> 18:46.517
Sorry about the soup.

18:46.517 --> 18:47.758
I don't think it
needs to be blended.

18:47.758 --> 18:48.482
But you-

18:48.482 --> 18:49.344
you should eat.

18:49.344 --> 18:50.137
Thanks, I will.

18:50.137 --> 18:50.793
Oh hey.

18:50.793 --> 18:51.448
Careful out there.

18:51.448 --> 18:52.137
<i>Thanks.</i>

18:52.137 --> 18:52.793
Rex.

18:55.655 --> 18:56.448
Hmm.

18:56.448 --> 18:57.137
Yep.

19:08.172 --> 19:09.413
They held you
at gunpoint?

19:09.413 --> 19:10.655
Oh just at first.

19:10.758 --> 19:11.758
At first?

19:11.758 --> 19:13.137
Let's just say-

19:13.137 --> 19:14.758
that things
relaxed quite a bit-

19:14.758 --> 19:16.206
when the wine
started flowing.

19:16.310 --> 19:17.172
Ughh.

19:17.172 --> 19:18.103
You were drinking
with them.

19:19.000 --> 19:20.862
Just like a
little bit.

19:21.275 --> 19:22.034
Oh here it is.

19:22.034 --> 19:22.689
<i>Cheers!</i>

19:22.689 --> 19:23.379
<i>Oh, here look.</i>

19:23.379 --> 19:24.275
<i>Oh yeah,
a little more!</i>

19:24.275 --> 19:25.000
<i>Ohhh!</i>

19:26.068 --> 19:26.758
Whoo!

19:27.482 --> 19:28.172
<i>My usual clientele-</i>

19:28.172 --> 19:28.862
<i>they're just-</i>

19:29.413 --> 19:30.344
they're so uptight.

19:30.965 --> 19:31.931
One-percenters.

19:32.758 --> 19:34.724
It was so refreshing to
finally cook for people-

19:34.724 --> 19:36.517
who can appreciate
my food.

19:36.517 --> 19:37.379
They were
such a hoot!

19:39.137 --> 19:40.068
<i>Ohhh!</i>

19:40.068 --> 19:41.758
<i>I honestly have not
laughed like that-</i>

19:41.758 --> 19:42.827
in so long.

19:42.827 --> 19:43.758
Oh look!

19:43.758 --> 19:44.517
Here.

19:45.241 --> 19:46.241
I took a selfie.

19:48.448 --> 19:50.034
<i>Over 2000 likes already.</i>

19:50.034 --> 19:52.448
You cannot buy that
kind of publicity.

19:52.448 --> 19:54.655
Yeah I thought
so too, but-

19:55.517 --> 19:56.517
<i>we only seem
to get the calls-</i>

19:56.517 --> 19:58.517
after they're gone.

20:01.482 --> 20:02.310
You mind?

20:15.620 --> 20:18.896
Did you get a sense of the
relationship between the women?

20:18.896 --> 20:20.379
What do you mean?

20:20.379 --> 20:24.137
Was Valerie being
manipulated by Vicky?

20:24.137 --> 20:25.241
Manipulated?

20:26.758 --> 20:29.620
She was very
protective of Valerie.

20:30.068 --> 20:31.724
Valerie was very particular
about what she ate.

20:32.206 --> 20:33.896
She said she liked
the Cod Wellington.

20:33.896 --> 20:36.482
But she didn't have
much of an appetite.

20:36.482 --> 20:37.206
Hmmm.

20:40.344 --> 20:41.344
Speaking of which-

20:41.344 --> 20:44.206
would somebody
like some leftovers?

20:44.206 --> 20:44.965
Here you go buddy!

20:49.827 --> 20:52.137
Looks like Rex didn't
read the Michelin reviews.

20:52.137 --> 20:54.793
They said your Cod
Wellington was transcendent.

20:56.586 --> 20:58.172
Is there coconut
in that?

20:58.172 --> 21:01.137
Cedar smoked snowflake coconut
imported from Madagascar.

21:01.689 --> 21:02.965
Rex doesn't like coconut.

21:02.965 --> 21:04.137
Ah.

21:04.551 --> 21:05.275
Sorry buddy.

21:07.827 --> 21:08.965
You know-

21:08.965 --> 21:10.862
I think this would be a
great place for a first date.

21:15.137 --> 21:16.172
Male DJ: <i>Who
would you pick-</i>

21:16.172 --> 21:17.448
<i>to play them
in the movie?</i>

21:17.448 --> 21:20.758
Female DJ: <i>I'd totally cast
Helen Mirren and Angela Basset.</i>

21:20.758 --> 21:21.793
<i>Because why not?</i>

21:21.793 --> 21:23.206
Male DJ: <i>Double
Oscar winners!</i>

21:23.206 --> 21:24.655
<i>Now that is
very badass!</i>

21:24.655 --> 21:25.827
Female DJ: <i>So are
Vicky and Valerie!</i>

21:25.827 --> 21:27.068
Male DJ: <i>Oh
by the way-</i>

21:27.068 --> 21:30.448
<i>if St. John's favourite female
fugitives are listening-</i>

21:30.448 --> 21:33.241
<i>we would love to interview
you here at the Morning Show!</i>

21:33.241 --> 21:34.862
Female DJ: <i>And I would
love to have you-</i>

21:34.862 --> 21:35.724
<i>at my next
dinner party!</i>

21:36.793 --> 21:38.137
Male DJ: <i>I am totes
finagling an invite-</i>

21:38.137 --> 21:39.551
<i>to that little soiree.</i>

21:40.241 --> 21:40.896
Okay.

21:42.137 --> 21:43.275
Hey, you
ready to go?

21:43.275 --> 21:44.896
Yeah, whenever you are.

21:44.896 --> 21:47.413
People are eating up
this Vicky and Valerie.

21:47.413 --> 21:49.206
It's like we're the bad guys
for even chasing them.

21:49.206 --> 21:50.275
No kidding.

21:50.275 --> 21:53.758
Look what someone painted
across town last night.

21:53.758 --> 21:55.620
<i>Viva Vicky and Valerie.</i>

21:58.172 --> 21:58.965
Seriously?

22:06.137 --> 22:06.758
Hey.

22:06.758 --> 22:07.896
Sorry we're late.

22:08.068 --> 22:09.206
Car trouble again?

22:09.965 --> 22:12.379
Uh- it just needs a
little help sometimes.

22:12.379 --> 22:13.689
Well, it's official.

22:14.517 --> 22:16.689
<i>Vicky and Valerie
are folk heroes.</i>

22:17.689 --> 22:19.137
<i>Vicky and
Valerie are murderers.</i>

22:19.137 --> 22:21.068
<i>Well those two things
aren't mutually exclusive.</i>

22:21.068 --> 22:22.206
<i>You still
think the publicity-</i>

22:22.206 --> 22:23.862
<i>is going to increase
calls to the tipline?</i>

22:24.931 --> 22:26.344
Yeah, they've been seen-

22:26.344 --> 22:27.758
rappelling off the
Confederation Building-

22:27.758 --> 22:31.103
<i>busking nude in
Bannerman Park-</i>

22:31.103 --> 22:33.103
and shouting obscenities
in the Basilica.

22:33.103 --> 22:34.655
Yeah we've been
slammed by hoax calls.

22:35.103 --> 22:35.758
Ahhh.

22:36.379 --> 22:37.344
<i>Guys.</i>

22:37.344 --> 22:39.965
I analyzed the material
in the baggie Rex found-

22:39.965 --> 22:40.655
at the store robbery.

22:40.655 --> 22:41.758
Great.

22:41.758 --> 22:43.068
I want to know what those
two have been smoking.

22:43.068 --> 22:44.586
Drinking, not smoking.

22:44.586 --> 22:46.379
It was Essaic tea.

22:46.379 --> 22:49.551
Some naturopaths recommend
it as a natural remedy.

22:49.551 --> 22:51.517
So they've just been
sipping herbal tea-

22:51.517 --> 22:52.379
shopping for luxury clothes-

22:52.379 --> 22:53.241
and eating at five
star restaurants?

22:53.241 --> 22:53.931
I know!

22:53.931 --> 22:54.758
It's like my
dream vacation.

22:54.758 --> 22:55.896
Yeah!

22:55.896 --> 22:57.241
<i>I would like to
know what they're up to.</i>

22:57.241 --> 22:58.655
Jesse, can you bring up
recent police reports?

22:58.758 --> 22:59.379
Yeah.

23:00.862 --> 23:02.034
Okay.

23:03.000 --> 23:03.827
Let's see what
you've got.

23:03.827 --> 23:04.517
Yeah.

23:06.172 --> 23:06.827
<i>Okay.</i>

23:06.827 --> 23:07.517
<i>Yeah.</i>

23:07.517 --> 23:09.448
<i>Mostly traffic violations.</i>

23:09.448 --> 23:11.206
Domestic disturbance.

23:11.724 --> 23:12.379
What's that one?

23:12.379 --> 23:13.034
Pull that up.

23:13.034 --> 23:13.724
Oh yeah.

23:14.896 --> 23:16.655
<i>Break in at a
clinic in Mt. Pearl.</i>

23:17.517 --> 23:18.517
Let's go check
that one out.

23:18.931 --> 23:19.586
<i>Come on pal.</i>

23:27.000 --> 23:27.965
Yes, we provide services-

23:27.965 --> 23:30.413
to inmates from Iron
Point Penitentiary.

23:30.413 --> 23:32.517
So Vicky and Valerie might have
known the layout of the place.

23:32.517 --> 23:33.965
Mmm.

23:33.965 --> 23:35.034
Well they've
definitely been here.

23:36.137 --> 23:38.655
This report says
Oxycodone was stolen.

23:40.206 --> 23:42.206
I don't get the impression
these two are addicts.

23:42.206 --> 23:44.931
Maybe they're going to
sell it to fund their getaway?

23:50.103 --> 23:51.586
Excuse me.

23:51.586 --> 23:52.827
What's in this
room here?

23:53.586 --> 23:55.137
Uh- the old archives.

23:55.137 --> 23:56.655
Everything's digital now though.

23:57.310 --> 23:58.241
Thank you.

23:58.965 --> 24:00.310
What have
you got pal?

24:11.137 --> 24:12.206
Hold on.

24:12.206 --> 24:12.965
<i>W.</i>

24:13.517 --> 24:14.689
Watch out.

24:15.000 --> 24:16.620
For Winehouse.

24:23.931 --> 24:25.275
Valerie's file is empty.

24:32.000 --> 24:33.448
Valerie had a CT
scan seven years ago.

24:33.448 --> 24:35.310
That's what was stolen
from the archives.

24:35.310 --> 24:36.655
Scans that hadn't
been digitized.

24:36.655 --> 24:39.103
And we don't know
what, if anything-

24:39.103 --> 24:40.034
was on that scan.

24:40.034 --> 24:41.034
We don't.

24:41.034 --> 24:42.827
The diagnostic analysis
was gone too.

24:42.827 --> 24:45.896
<i>However, between the theft of
the scans, the herbal teas-</i>

24:45.896 --> 24:47.413
and the stolen painkillers-

24:47.413 --> 24:49.862
I suspect
Valerie is sick.

24:49.862 --> 24:53.379
Well Chef McCrae said that
Vicky was protective of her.

24:53.379 --> 24:55.068
<i>And Valerie did
have a loss of appetite.</i>

24:55.068 --> 24:56.000
<i>If she was sick-</i>

24:56.000 --> 24:57.586
maybe that's why they
haven't left town.

25:00.896 --> 25:02.103
I think Jesse
has something.

25:02.517 --> 25:03.344
You know
me too well.

25:03.344 --> 25:04.034
Come with me.

25:05.620 --> 25:06.448
So-

25:07.448 --> 25:08.931
I've been reviewing
prison security footage-

25:08.931 --> 25:10.551
trying to figure out how
the bomb components-

25:10.551 --> 25:12.413
and the paramedics
uniforms got smuggled in.

25:12.413 --> 25:15.413
Now I decided to check
the perimeter of the prison.

25:15.413 --> 25:16.103
<i>Look at this.</i>

25:20.517 --> 25:21.344
<i>What is that?</i>

25:21.344 --> 25:22.241
A drone?

25:22.689 --> 25:23.344
Mm-hmm.

25:24.000 --> 25:25.655
Now here is the
make and model.

25:25.758 --> 25:28.310
<i>I've compared
the flight path-</i>

25:28.310 --> 25:29.379
<i>of that particular drone-</i>

25:29.379 --> 25:30.206
<i>and matched
this drop-</i>

25:30.206 --> 25:31.448
to an operator.

25:31.896 --> 25:32.758
Do you have
a name?

25:32.758 --> 25:33.965
Penelope Gumble.

25:47.448 --> 25:48.482
Okay.

25:48.482 --> 25:51.068
So you know that's
illegal, right?

25:51.482 --> 25:52.655
To fly a drone?

25:52.655 --> 25:53.931
Since when?

25:53.931 --> 25:56.758
Well since it passed through
a penitentiary, for starters.

25:58.310 --> 26:00.689
You ever kick a ball over
a fence accidentally?

26:01.000 --> 26:02.034
An honest mistake.

26:02.344 --> 26:04.241
Oh okay.

26:04.241 --> 26:06.862
<i>Penelope, we know you
delivered something.</i>

26:06.862 --> 26:10.000
I could charge you for
smuggling contraband right now.

26:12.689 --> 26:13.655
Could charge me?

26:14.103 --> 26:15.275
Or are charging me?

26:15.275 --> 26:16.482
Well why don't
we just start-

26:16.482 --> 26:18.310
with what you sent
over the wall first?

26:18.931 --> 26:20.310
Was it bomb components?

26:20.310 --> 26:21.862
It was just stuff.

26:22.620 --> 26:24.000
I didn't know
what it was for.

26:24.655 --> 26:25.896
All I know-

26:25.896 --> 26:28.413
is that Aunt Vicky texted me
from prison on a burner phone-

26:28.413 --> 26:29.758
and said she
needed some things.

26:29.758 --> 26:31.000
A burner phone.

26:33.793 --> 26:35.344
I'm going to need
that number.

26:38.793 --> 26:40.344
Dr. Keller: <i>There's
nothing I can do.</i>

26:40.344 --> 26:41.551
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

26:41.551 --> 26:42.896
<i>Well you can try
looking at the damn thing.</i>

26:42.896 --> 26:44.310
<i>I can't even
move it anymore!</i>

26:44.689 --> 26:45.724
<i>Now, Jane.</i>

26:45.827 --> 26:47.448
<i>Don't now Jane me.</i>

26:48.034 --> 26:48.758
<i>It hurts!</i>

26:48.758 --> 26:50.000
<i>It's getting worse!</i>

26:50.000 --> 26:51.517
Dr. Keller: <i>You can't
complain away a sprain.</i>

26:51.517 --> 26:53.344
These things take time!

26:53.344 --> 26:54.586
Your body is it's
own best healer.

26:55.586 --> 26:56.448
Yeah?

26:56.448 --> 26:57.655
Then what the hell
are you good for?

26:57.655 --> 26:59.241
This visit is over.

26:59.241 --> 26:59.931
Guard.

27:14.620 --> 27:17.206
That looked pretty bad.

27:17.206 --> 27:19.310
I take a lot
of abuse.

27:20.034 --> 27:20.862
Goes with the territory.

27:20.862 --> 27:23.000
I meant her wrist.

27:23.000 --> 27:24.068
Oh.

27:24.068 --> 27:26.172
I suspect she's deliberately
re-injuring it-

27:26.172 --> 27:28.241
in the hopes of another
visit to the clinic.

27:28.862 --> 27:30.103
<i>Speaking of the clinic-</i>

27:30.103 --> 27:32.275
it looks like Vicky and
Valerie broke into it-

27:32.275 --> 27:33.137
and stole Oxycodone.

27:33.137 --> 27:33.793
Oh dear.

27:33.793 --> 27:34.793
<i>Yes.</i>

27:34.793 --> 27:35.931
And a seven-year-old
CT scan of Valerie's.

27:35.931 --> 27:38.931
Do you remember the diagnosis
from that missing scan?

27:38.931 --> 27:40.862
Yeah, it was inconclusive.

27:40.862 --> 27:42.551
<i>Valerie Winehouse-</i>

27:42.551 --> 27:44.482
has a history
of hypochondria.

27:44.482 --> 27:46.172
It's my belief that
negative thinking-

27:46.172 --> 27:48.413
often leads to real-
life health outcomes.

27:48.413 --> 27:49.172
Huh.

27:49.172 --> 27:50.275
It's my belief-

27:50.275 --> 27:52.689
that being incarcerated
leads to negative thinking.

27:54.000 --> 27:55.068
In any case-

27:55.068 --> 27:55.965
I shouldn't be discussing-

27:55.965 --> 27:57.793
confidential patient information.

27:57.793 --> 27:59.862
Would you prefer I come
back with a court order-

27:59.862 --> 28:01.689
demanding complete access
to this infirmary's files?

28:01.689 --> 28:04.413
Or would you like to
just tell me right now?

28:05.586 --> 28:07.068
What's wrong with Valerie?

28:11.965 --> 28:13.862
Okay, I'll see if I can
trace Vicky's number.

28:13.862 --> 28:15.724
With any luck she's still
using the same phone.

28:17.827 --> 28:18.896
Sarah?

28:18.896 --> 28:20.034
Charlie.

28:21.517 --> 28:22.793
Valerie Winehouse is dying.

28:23.827 --> 28:24.482
What?

28:24.482 --> 28:25.965
It's gallbladder cancer.

28:27.344 --> 28:28.517
Stage four.

28:28.517 --> 28:30.620
<i>Dr. Audrey Keller just told me
she has weeks to live.</i>

28:30.620 --> 28:32.758
<i>Which is why she escaped
before her parole.</i>

28:32.862 --> 28:33.448
Yeah.

28:34.620 --> 28:38.551
And why they're living every day
like it's their last.

28:38.551 --> 28:39.586
It's a bucket list.

28:39.586 --> 28:40.689
Hey!

28:40.689 --> 28:41.793
Vicky's number just pinged
from Whale Watch Beach!

28:42.862 --> 28:43.551
I've got to go.

28:43.551 --> 28:44.241
Rex.

28:44.241 --> 28:44.931
Come on.

28:58.551 --> 28:59.482
Come on pal.

29:20.896 --> 29:23.000
<i>These things
I promise you.</i>

29:23.000 --> 29:24.275
<i>I will be
faithful to you.</i>

29:24.275 --> 29:27.620
<i>I will be
honest to you.</i>

29:27.620 --> 29:30.758
<i>I will trust and
respect and help-</i>

29:30.758 --> 29:32.379
and care for you.

29:32.482 --> 29:34.586
<i>I'll share my
life with you.</i>

29:34.586 --> 29:36.241
St. John's Police Department.

29:36.241 --> 29:37.172
Oh no!

29:37.827 --> 29:39.413
We were so close!

29:40.379 --> 29:41.862
Oh God!

29:41.862 --> 29:42.551
Detective Hudson.

29:42.551 --> 29:44.689
<i>Are you happy now?</i>

29:44.689 --> 29:46.344
Darling, don't cry.

29:46.344 --> 29:47.103
<i>Please.</i>

29:47.103 --> 29:47.931
<i>I mean-</i>

29:47.931 --> 29:49.655
<i>God knows.</i>

29:49.655 --> 29:50.689
<i>He saw us!</i>

29:50.689 --> 29:52.620
<i>We are married
in his eyes.</i>

29:52.620 --> 29:53.482
<i>But we
didn't finish.</i>

29:53.482 --> 29:55.931
And I didn't
get to say I do.

29:55.931 --> 29:57.758
Oh please.

29:57.758 --> 29:59.344
<i>Please.</i>

29:59.344 --> 30:00.758
<i>We promise to surrender-</i>

30:00.758 --> 30:01.896
without any trouble.

30:02.793 --> 30:03.793
After.

30:25.517 --> 30:26.551
What is up
with you?

30:27.310 --> 30:28.689
Love is in
the air Jesse.

30:28.689 --> 30:29.862
Uh-oh.

30:29.862 --> 30:31.965
Yeah, I made a date
with my Sifter match.

30:31.965 --> 30:33.758
Well I mean I hope
you took my advice.

30:33.758 --> 30:35.068
Short coffee date right?

30:35.068 --> 30:36.068
No.

30:36.068 --> 30:38.137
No, I'm going
to wow her.

30:38.137 --> 30:39.620
I made reservations
for CHOO!

30:42.137 --> 30:42.793
What?

30:43.517 --> 30:45.724
CHOO has a three
course minimum.

30:45.724 --> 30:47.896
<i>At least let me be
your emergency call.</i>

30:47.896 --> 30:49.379
My emergency call?

30:49.379 --> 30:50.275
Yeah!

30:50.275 --> 30:51.655
That is when you
have a friend call you-

30:51.655 --> 30:52.620
fifteen minutes
into the date.

30:52.620 --> 30:53.827
And so if it's
not going well-

30:53.827 --> 30:54.758
at least
you can say-

30:54.758 --> 30:55.931
<i>you have an
emergency to tend to.</i>

30:55.931 --> 30:57.620
That's the most childish
thing I've heard in my life!

30:57.620 --> 30:58.310
It's effective.

30:58.310 --> 30:58.965
Yeah, effective.

30:58.965 --> 31:00.793
But entirely unnecessary.

31:00.793 --> 31:02.068
<i>Don't worry Jesse!</i>

31:02.655 --> 31:03.620
I got this!

31:08.827 --> 31:10.862
<i>I will
forgive you-</i>

31:12.034 --> 31:14.551
as we have
been forgiven.

31:14.551 --> 31:20.448
I will try with you to better
understand ourselves-

31:20.448 --> 31:24.206
<i>the world, and God-</i>

31:24.206 --> 31:27.758
<i>through the best
and worst to come-</i>

31:29.000 --> 31:30.793
as long
as we live.

31:43.965 --> 31:46.068
Let these rings
always be a reminder

31:46.068 --> 31:48.172
<i>of the promises you've
made to each other-</i>

31:48.172 --> 31:49.931
and the unwavering
bond between you.

31:52.620 --> 31:53.655
<i>You may kiss the-</i>

31:54.310 --> 31:55.275
each other.

32:00.793 --> 32:01.931
I don't suppose-

32:01.931 --> 32:03.827
you're going to let us go
on that honeymoon are you?

32:04.724 --> 32:05.827
I would
if I could.

32:05.827 --> 32:08.655
Oh, come on!

32:14.586 --> 32:15.896
I'm so thrilled-

32:15.896 --> 32:18.551
you've chosen to pester me
here in solitary confinement.

32:19.931 --> 32:22.310
Solitary confinement
is illegal in Canada.

32:22.310 --> 32:23.034
This is a-

32:23.034 --> 32:25.137
Structured Intervention Unit.

32:25.137 --> 32:26.241
I know.

32:26.241 --> 32:27.206
<i>You say tom-ay-to.</i>

32:27.206 --> 32:28.655
<i>I say tom-ah-to.</i>

32:28.655 --> 32:30.241
What do you want?

32:31.965 --> 32:33.344
Did you know about
Valerie's health?

32:34.689 --> 32:36.758
I was hoping you needed me
to blow something up!

32:37.793 --> 32:38.931
I'm not ratting
out my friends.

32:38.931 --> 32:41.517
I'm not asking you
to rat out anyone.

32:41.517 --> 32:42.379
I already know-

32:42.379 --> 32:43.379
<i>about the cancer.</i>

32:43.379 --> 32:44.586
<i>I'm actually asking-</i>

32:44.586 --> 32:46.241
about the medical care she
was receiving here in prison.

32:48.000 --> 32:49.068
What care?

33:01.482 --> 33:02.482
Valerie suffered for years-

33:02.482 --> 33:04.655
before Keller admitted
it was cancer.

33:04.655 --> 33:05.482
<i>By that time-</i>

33:05.482 --> 33:06.482
<i>it was stage four.</i>

33:07.448 --> 33:08.275
And beyond hope.

33:09.344 --> 33:11.068
She wasn't supposed
to have a life sentence.

33:12.551 --> 33:13.896
So you think Valerie
could have been cured-

33:13.896 --> 33:15.620
if Dr. Keller had
diagnosed her sooner?

33:15.620 --> 33:16.482
Yeah.

33:18.379 --> 33:20.724
But she knew she wouldn't
make it to her parole hearing.

33:21.344 --> 33:23.241
That's when Vicky
came up with the plan-

33:23.241 --> 33:24.862
to have one
last party.

33:24.862 --> 33:27.068
And that's why you
planted the bomb.

33:27.068 --> 33:28.517
I was happy
to help.

33:28.517 --> 33:31.413
And if Vicky can prove
Keller's negligence-

33:31.413 --> 33:33.551
that'll be the icing
on the wedding cake.

33:34.275 --> 33:37.655
I swear that woman would love
to just gas us all to death.

33:37.655 --> 33:38.931
One missed diagnosis-

33:38.931 --> 33:42.344
doesn't prove the doctor is
deliberately neglecting inmates.

33:42.344 --> 33:44.379
You wanted to know
how I lost my toes.

33:48.000 --> 33:49.896
<i>It's because that quack-</i>

33:49.896 --> 33:51.379
refused to treat
my diabetes.

33:52.310 --> 33:53.931
There's lots of stories
like mine in here-

33:53.931 --> 33:54.965
if you care
to listen.

33:55.931 --> 33:56.655
I do.

33:59.655 --> 34:00.896
Can you give
me names?

34:09.827 --> 34:10.517
Oh!

34:10.517 --> 34:11.241
Oh I've got you!

34:11.241 --> 34:12.068
Oh oh!

34:13.482 --> 34:14.379
Ahh!

34:14.482 --> 34:15.137
Oh my God!

34:15.137 --> 34:16.344
Valerie!

34:19.275 --> 34:20.551
This is Detective
Charlie Hudson.

34:20.551 --> 34:21.448
I need a
medical unit-

34:21.448 --> 34:23.034
to Whale Watch
Beach now.

34:28.206 --> 34:29.413
Oh of course.

34:29.689 --> 34:30.517
You stay here
with her.

34:30.517 --> 34:31.448
Rex let's go.

34:31.448 --> 34:32.517
Come on!

34:38.620 --> 34:39.344
<i>Oh come on!</i>

34:40.310 --> 34:41.620
You were the ring
bearer at my wedding!

34:43.379 --> 34:44.310
Nice try Vicky.

34:45.413 --> 34:46.379
You didn't think-

34:46.379 --> 34:47.655
that we were going to
actually let you escape?

34:47.655 --> 34:48.310
Did you?

34:48.310 --> 34:49.103
No.

34:49.103 --> 34:50.379
I did not, Detective.

34:53.379 --> 34:54.862
Not for one second.

34:55.379 --> 34:56.034
Aghh.

34:56.034 --> 34:56.724
Rex!

35:10.931 --> 35:12.620
You're not getting away
that easily Valerie.

35:20.068 --> 35:21.379
It's okay pal.

35:21.379 --> 35:22.689
They fooled me too.

35:24.034 --> 35:25.000
<i>Come on.</i>

35:31.758 --> 35:33.275
<i>I am never
going to tell you-</i>

35:33.275 --> 35:34.758
<i>where Valerie is.</i>

35:34.758 --> 35:35.655
I mean-

35:35.655 --> 35:37.448
would you betray
the love of your life?

35:40.379 --> 35:41.379
Have a seat.

35:45.655 --> 35:48.379
<i>You have no idea what it's like
to be an ex-cop in prison.</i>

35:49.275 --> 35:50.379
Everybody hates you.

35:50.931 --> 35:51.896
It was horrible.

35:53.000 --> 35:54.551
<i>I really didn't think
I was going to make it.</i>

35:55.241 --> 35:56.379
But Valerie-

35:56.379 --> 35:58.931
<i>she didn't care
who I used to be.</i>

35:58.931 --> 36:01.896
She only cared who I
was when I was with her.

36:02.862 --> 36:03.655
She-

36:04.827 --> 36:06.793
she made me a
better person.

36:09.724 --> 36:14.793
The kind of person who looks
after vulnerable prisoners.

36:14.793 --> 36:16.758
We retrieved your duffle
bag from the beach.

36:16.758 --> 36:18.000
And it's full of
medical records-

36:18.000 --> 36:19.931
<i>and written testimony-</i>

36:19.931 --> 36:21.655
from inmates' loved ones.

36:21.655 --> 36:22.655
Just because
you're a prisoner-

36:22.655 --> 36:24.000
doesn't mean
you don't count.

36:24.655 --> 36:27.793
<i>Dr. Keller is a
sadistic monster.</i>

36:27.793 --> 36:30.896
She would withhold
treatment from prisoners-

36:30.896 --> 36:33.793
<i>and then push assisted
suicide on them-</i>

36:33.793 --> 36:36.689
when their pain
became unbearable.

36:36.689 --> 36:39.137
That's a violation
of the code of ethics.

36:39.137 --> 36:42.000
Doctors can
provide the option.

36:42.000 --> 36:43.206
They can't
push for it.

36:43.206 --> 36:44.620
<i>Oh yeah.</i>

36:44.620 --> 36:46.655
Capital punishment
is illegal in Canada.

36:46.655 --> 36:48.000
But-

36:48.000 --> 36:50.344
apparently Keller
didn't get the memo.

36:55.551 --> 36:57.034
She makes a
compelling case.

36:57.241 --> 36:58.310
I don't know.

36:58.310 --> 37:00.931
I mean, medical care in
prisons is notoriously bad.

37:00.931 --> 37:03.310
Is it possible Dr. Keller
is just making the best-

37:03.310 --> 37:05.275
with the resources and
the limitations she has?

37:05.275 --> 37:05.965
No no.

37:05.965 --> 37:07.379
I believe
Vicky, Charlie.

37:07.379 --> 37:09.068
I've already interviewed
other inmates-

37:09.068 --> 37:09.862
who've corroborate her claims.

37:09.862 --> 37:10.827
And I've notified
the Warden-

37:10.827 --> 37:13.310
that I'm not done
investigating this.

37:14.724 --> 37:15.586
Okay.

37:15.586 --> 37:18.206
This has been
their plan all along.

37:18.206 --> 37:19.172
<i>Well, I mean-</i>

37:19.172 --> 37:20.517
if Vicky and
Valerie are right-

37:20.517 --> 37:24.827
and Dr. Keller did cost
Valerie her chance at freedom-

37:24.827 --> 37:26.620
revenge might be on
their bucket list too.

37:34.551 --> 37:36.620
No answer at Dr.
Keller's private practice.

37:37.896 --> 37:38.551
Go.

37:39.034 --> 37:39.724
Rex.

37:49.068 --> 37:49.896
Valerie.

37:50.275 --> 37:51.517
Stay back!

37:53.620 --> 37:54.551
Stay back!

37:56.206 --> 37:57.344
Okay easy pal.

38:01.068 --> 38:02.000
Don't do this.

38:02.000 --> 38:03.310
You're not a murderer.

38:03.310 --> 38:05.689
Well I guess you don't
read the papers.

38:05.689 --> 38:07.724
Because I shot a
man in the head.

38:07.724 --> 38:09.896
Yeah, you shot your boyfriend
after years of abuse.

38:09.896 --> 38:12.413
You were a
model prisoner.

38:12.413 --> 38:13.586
You served your time.

38:14.379 --> 38:15.551
This is not you.

38:15.551 --> 38:16.827
I could
have gotten out.

38:18.137 --> 38:20.551
I could have
had a life.

38:20.551 --> 38:22.620
<i>She knew that
I was sick!</i>

38:22.620 --> 38:23.724
<i>She knew way back-</i>

38:23.724 --> 38:25.758
when it was
still curable!

38:25.758 --> 38:27.034
She took my life!

38:27.034 --> 38:28.586
And now I am
going to take hers!

38:28.586 --> 38:30.620
You already have!

38:31.448 --> 38:33.137
Look at me.

38:33.137 --> 38:35.931
We've got the evidence that
you and Vicky collected.

38:35.931 --> 38:38.448
We have corroborating stories
from other prisoners.

38:39.586 --> 38:40.689
<i>Dr. Keller-</i>

38:40.689 --> 38:43.517
is going to bear the weight
of the pain she caused.

38:43.517 --> 38:45.103
What about my pain?

38:45.103 --> 38:46.931
You've got a
lot of people-

38:46.931 --> 38:49.241
rooting for you
and Vicky right now.

38:49.241 --> 38:51.620
If you hurt Dr. Keller,
that becomes the story.

38:51.620 --> 38:53.551
<i>You kill her now-</i>

38:55.000 --> 38:56.137
<i>you help yourself.</i>

38:56.137 --> 38:57.620
You let her go-

38:59.310 --> 39:00.517
the world hears
what she did.

39:02.344 --> 39:03.379
Come on.

39:03.482 --> 39:05.517
<i>No they won't.</i>

39:06.206 --> 39:07.103
No they won't.

39:07.551 --> 39:09.724
Because I know how
the system works.

39:10.862 --> 39:12.655
They won't know
what she did-

39:12.655 --> 39:14.827
until she admits it.

39:14.827 --> 39:15.793
Admit it.

39:15.793 --> 39:16.896
<i>Admit it!</i>

39:18.206 --> 39:19.103
Dr. Keller.

39:19.103 --> 39:20.758
You knew Valerie's
diagnosis, didn't you?

39:20.758 --> 39:21.793
Yes!

39:22.620 --> 39:23.241
Yes!

39:23.241 --> 39:24.068
I knew.

39:24.068 --> 39:25.482
I knew you had
cancer for years!

39:25.482 --> 39:26.896
And I said nothing.

39:27.655 --> 39:29.655
Please don't kill me!

39:41.482 --> 39:42.655
<i>Good boy.</i>

40:05.482 --> 40:06.137
Cheers.

40:14.172 --> 40:15.103
Mmmm!

40:19.655 --> 40:21.000
<i>Goodbye Pork Pie Hat.</i>

40:22.379 --> 40:23.758
<i>I love that.</i>

40:23.758 --> 40:24.758
Beg your pardon?

40:24.758 --> 40:26.206
It's the song.

40:27.344 --> 40:28.034
Charles Mingus.

40:28.034 --> 40:29.482
He wrote it
as an elegy-

40:29.482 --> 40:31.827
to his saxophonist.

40:31.827 --> 40:32.551
Lester.

40:32.551 --> 40:33.241
Young.

40:33.241 --> 40:33.931
It's-

40:35.068 --> 40:36.620
I can't say I really
care for jazz.

40:41.344 --> 40:42.000
Oh!

40:42.000 --> 40:42.965
That ring-

40:42.965 --> 40:44.068
<i>is spectacular!</i>

40:44.068 --> 40:44.827
<i>What is it?</i>

40:44.827 --> 40:45.482
<i>Sapphire?</i>

40:45.482 --> 40:47.034
Yes!

40:47.034 --> 40:48.000
It's very expensive.

40:48.000 --> 40:50.482
<i>It was a gift
from my ex.</i>

40:50.482 --> 40:52.655
He has great taste.

40:54.379 --> 40:55.275
Of course.

40:57.275 --> 40:58.965
Oh I'm so sorry.

40:58.965 --> 40:59.827
I have to
take this.

40:59.827 --> 41:00.931
No you go ahead.

41:03.310 --> 41:04.137
Hello?

41:04.137 --> 41:05.620
<i>So is he
a dud or what?</i>

41:05.620 --> 41:06.689
Oh no!

41:06.689 --> 41:07.896
<i>Do you want
to get out of there?</i>

41:07.896 --> 41:09.172
I'll be there
right away.

41:09.275 --> 41:10.689
Uh-

41:10.689 --> 41:12.034
I guess it's
an emergency?

41:13.172 --> 41:14.172
How did you know?

41:14.172 --> 41:16.000
Just intuition I guess.

41:16.000 --> 41:16.827
I'm so sorry.

41:16.827 --> 41:18.068
I have to go.

41:19.586 --> 41:20.206
Oh!

41:20.206 --> 41:20.931
Bye.

41:22.551 --> 41:23.413
Superintendent!

41:23.413 --> 41:26.517
I have your appetizer.

41:26.517 --> 41:29.551
But I don't think the diver
scallop will fare very well-

41:29.551 --> 41:30.724
in a to-go box.

41:30.724 --> 41:31.448
Yeah.

41:32.413 --> 41:34.517
You know, let me
make a phone call.

41:34.517 --> 41:36.206
<i>Here, let's get you
started with these.</i>

41:36.206 --> 41:37.275
Thank you.

41:38.896 --> 41:39.551
Okay.

41:39.551 --> 41:40.655
So I show up-

41:40.655 --> 41:43.724
wearing this kickass,
detailed Cosplay ensemble-

41:43.724 --> 41:45.241
which surprisingly,
it didn't go over well.

41:45.241 --> 41:46.206
You don't say.

41:46.206 --> 41:47.448
Well she did say it was
her favourite movie.

41:47.448 --> 41:48.172
But you know what?

41:48.172 --> 41:49.206
You don't
have to worry.

41:49.206 --> 41:50.551
<i>You're not going to
make that mistake okay?</i>

41:50.551 --> 41:51.551
<i>So here's one.</i>

41:51.551 --> 41:52.241
Okay.

41:52.241 --> 41:53.172
I'm all ears.

41:53.172 --> 41:54.103
Apparently-

41:54.103 --> 41:56.379
it is too much to
show up to her house-

41:56.379 --> 41:57.793
with a massive bouquet-

41:57.793 --> 42:00.034
<i>of alphabet balloons
spelling out her name.</i>

42:00.034 --> 42:00.758
That didn't work?

42:00.758 --> 42:02.103
<i>Jesse, I'm so shocked.</i>

42:02.103 --> 42:04.103
This one is
absolutely crucial.

42:04.103 --> 42:05.068
No flashhmobs.

42:05.068 --> 42:05.724
Noted.

42:05.724 --> 42:06.448
<i>Yeah.</i>

42:06.448 --> 42:07.413
I don't know
what that is.

42:07.413 --> 42:08.827
Mmmm!

42:08.827 --> 42:10.724
Excuse me, can I get
a little top-up please?

42:10.724 --> 42:12.172
This is delightful!

42:12.172 --> 42:13.379
You're delightful!

42:24.310 --> 42:25.172
Oh!

42:25.827 --> 42:26.896
I'll see you tomorrow.

42:27.827 --> 42:29.448
Hope you don't mind
a few more visitors.

42:29.448 --> 42:31.000
Oh, not at all.

42:31.517 --> 42:33.620
<i>Oh hey Rex!</i>

42:35.965 --> 42:38.655
Oh this is
much better.

42:39.655 --> 42:40.758
Thank you.

42:40.758 --> 42:42.413
Thank you so much for
everything that you've done.

42:42.413 --> 42:45.310
<i>I mean, Dr. Harris-</i>

42:45.310 --> 42:46.000
she's a great physician.

42:46.000 --> 42:46.655
Isn't she?

42:46.655 --> 42:48.034
Yeah, she is.

42:48.034 --> 42:49.241
<i>She's just the first of
my friends I've talked to-</i>

42:49.241 --> 42:50.241
who want to help.

42:50.241 --> 42:51.758
You've made a big
difference here.

42:51.758 --> 42:53.103
Well this is only
the beginning!

42:53.103 --> 42:55.103
Vicky and I now have
a common cause.

42:56.034 --> 42:57.965
Yeah, we're going to
raise a little hell.

42:57.965 --> 43:00.827
After we reform the
prison medical system.

43:00.827 --> 43:02.206
Yes!

43:07.655 --> 43:10.724
<i>That's a
good boy, Rex.</i>
