00:01.833 --> 00:02.533
Previously on "Switched at Birth"...

00:02.567 --> 00:03.400
I got a little something for you.

00:03.435 --> 00:04.635
Voilà!

00:04.669 --> 00:06.170
You think I cheated?

00:06.204 --> 00:07.404
You'll be treated fairly.

00:07.439 --> 00:09.073
If I was being treated fairly,

00:09.107 --> 00:10.507
I wouldn't have to go in
front of an Honor Board.

00:10.542 --> 00:12.109
John, you're a leader.

00:12.143 --> 00:13.277
You deserve a third act.

00:13.311 --> 00:14.311
Think about it.

00:14.346 --> 00:16.046
You're moving in with angelo?

00:16.081 --> 00:19.817
I don't really see what
would be stopping me.

00:19.851 --> 00:20.951
I thought maybe you wanted to know

00:20.986 --> 00:22.152
That you had another one on the way.

00:22.187 --> 00:26.857
How weird would it be for
you if I went to Carlton?

00:26.891 --> 00:29.526
Good luck convincing "J" and "K" of that.

00:29.561 --> 00:31.495
Mm, that's where you come in.

00:34.499 --> 00:36.767
But going to Carlton
doesn't make any sense.

00:36.801 --> 00:39.403
A ton of hearing kids go there.

00:39.437 --> 00:41.238
Well, not a ton. But they do have

00:41.273 --> 00:44.241
this new pilot program
for kids with deaf parents

00:44.276 --> 00:45.442
or deaf siblings.

00:45.477 --> 00:46.510
Which I am.

00:46.544 --> 00:49.213
Look, honey, if you
wanna go somewhere else

00:49.247 --> 00:50.281
we can talk about it.

00:50.315 --> 00:52.883
Why would I go to some random school

00:52.917 --> 00:54.051
where I don't know anybody?

00:54.085 --> 00:55.819
Daphne can help me out.

00:55.854 --> 00:57.988
She can introduce me to people.

00:58.023 --> 01:00.024
We can carpool.

01:00.058 --> 01:01.825
Save the planet. You
love saving the planet.

01:01.860 --> 01:04.595
Sweetie, it is our responsibility
to make sure that you

01:04.629 --> 01:05.763
get a good education.

01:05.797 --> 01:08.799
Daphne takes calculus
and physics, just like me.

01:08.833 --> 01:11.702
Yeah, but...

01:11.736 --> 01:14.338
We might not have an olympic swimming pool

01:14.372 --> 01:16.373
or sushi in the cafeteria,

01:16.408 --> 01:18.242
but our teachers are really good.

01:18.276 --> 01:19.543
- I... we know that.
- That's not what I meant.

01:19.577 --> 01:22.179
Bay, look, your plate is pretty full.

01:22.237 --> 01:23.971
Yeah, I... I know.

01:24.005 --> 01:26.125
But I'm gonna still work a
lot of hours at the car wash

01:26.140 --> 01:27.841
to pay you back

01:27.876 --> 01:28.942
and you guys are the ones

01:28.960 --> 01:31.745
who keep saying that I
need to distinguish myself

01:31.779 --> 01:33.747
on college applications.

01:33.781 --> 01:35.782
Honey, you were switched at birth.

01:35.800 --> 01:37.935
But going to Carlton is very unique.

01:37.986 --> 01:41.555
We are not sending her to a deaf
school for her college essay.

01:41.589 --> 01:43.557
I love signing.

01:43.591 --> 01:44.858
And I'm good at it.

01:44.893 --> 01:47.694
And I never felt...

01:47.729 --> 01:50.230
at home at Buckner.

01:50.265 --> 01:52.599
Please, just let me try it.

01:54.235 --> 01:56.103
I'll give you guys some time to process.

01:57.604 --> 02:00.022
_

02:00.023 --> 02:02.796
_

02:05.046 --> 02:06.780
I barely wanted Daphne to go.

02:06.814 --> 02:07.814
Now Bay too?

02:07.849 --> 02:09.750
Can we just take a second to marvel

02:09.783 --> 02:13.687
in the fact that Bay was
actually arguing for school?

02:13.721 --> 02:16.523
My hearing daughter at a deaf school?

02:16.558 --> 02:17.875
You dared me to dream big.

02:17.909 --> 02:19.576
Yes, I did.

02:19.627 --> 02:21.762
And I never thought I was
interested in swimming pools,

02:21.796 --> 02:26.333
but then I found these.

02:26.367 --> 02:27.634
It's a new kind of ecological pool

02:27.669 --> 02:30.304
where you have all these native
plants that filter the water.

02:30.338 --> 02:32.439
There are zero chemicals.

02:32.473 --> 02:35.042
The plants do all the
work, just like a real pond.

02:35.076 --> 02:37.010
Only, you know, not disgusting.

02:37.045 --> 02:39.046
They're beautiful.

02:39.080 --> 02:40.280
You hate it.

02:40.315 --> 02:42.950
No.

02:42.984 --> 02:44.184
But I got some news.

02:46.955 --> 02:50.958
Um, it seems like I'm
gonna be a father again.

02:52.026 --> 02:54.828
What?

02:57.799 --> 03:00.299
- synced and corrected by chamallow -
- www.addic7ed.com -

03:03.000 --> 03:03.946
Is this a joke?

03:03.947 --> 03:06.095
You really got some girl pregnant?

03:06.768 --> 03:08.635
We had one night together. Just one night.

03:08.670 --> 03:09.903
It's just my stupid luck.

03:09.937 --> 03:11.672
Oh oh,

03:11.706 --> 03:13.040
it was luck.

03:13.074 --> 03:15.042
It was just bad luck

03:15.076 --> 03:16.943
that made this happen.

03:16.978 --> 03:19.046
Or was it you choosing to have sex

03:19.080 --> 03:20.881
with some girl you just met?!

03:20.915 --> 03:23.083
I know, I know it's my responsibility.

03:23.117 --> 03:26.086
And I accept that. And I'm gonna do
everything possible to make this right.

03:26.120 --> 03:29.706
Do you have any idea

03:29.741 --> 03:30.991
how big of an idiot I feel like

03:31.025 --> 03:34.795
right now? Do you?

03:34.829 --> 03:37.631
We are in the middle of building
our dream house together.

03:37.665 --> 03:39.066
Okay, but nothing has to change.

03:41.869 --> 03:42.903
What's her name?

03:44.972 --> 03:46.707
Lana.

03:46.741 --> 03:48.008
How old?

03:48.042 --> 03:49.943
I don't know.

03:49.977 --> 03:51.945
20? 22?

03:51.979 --> 03:54.948
I will do anything to
make this right with you.

03:54.982 --> 03:56.900
Sure. Sure.

03:56.934 --> 03:58.685
We'll just pretend it never happened,

03:58.720 --> 03:59.920
and go back to planning our marble shower.

03:59.954 --> 04:03.990
This girl and I, we
have nothing between us.

04:04.025 --> 04:07.060
You and me, we have everything.

04:07.095 --> 04:09.896
And yet...

04:09.914 --> 04:11.748
you threw it all away.

04:11.783 --> 04:13.900
Gina.

04:15.000 --> 04:21.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:23.978 --> 04:25.762
Wow!

04:27.048 --> 04:29.800
I was just getting used
to the sea creatures.

04:29.851 --> 04:30.967
Ah well, you know,

04:31.018 --> 04:33.820
new school, new look.

04:33.855 --> 04:36.723
Thank you so much for
convincing dad, by the way.

04:36.791 --> 04:37.891
I know he's nervous, but trust me,

04:37.925 --> 04:39.826
you guys are not going to regret this.

04:39.861 --> 04:42.896
Hon, this whole Carlton thing

04:42.930 --> 04:44.898
is not just about Emmett, is it?

04:44.932 --> 04:47.100
Uh, no. Of course not.

04:47.135 --> 04:49.636
I mean, yeah, it'll be nice
to have another friend there,

04:49.670 --> 04:52.973
but this decision was
entirely Emmett-free.

04:53.007 --> 04:54.741
I swear, we're not back together.

04:54.776 --> 04:57.811
Oh oh!

04:57.845 --> 05:01.047
Can you come inside? Your dad and I
want to talk all of you about something.

05:01.082 --> 05:03.984
- Something wrong?
- No no no no, nothing bad.

05:04.018 --> 05:05.719
Just come on.

05:08.623 --> 05:09.806
Toby!

05:12.844 --> 05:14.004
Please tell me he hasn't also

05:14.011 --> 05:15.846
knocked somebody up.

05:17.014 --> 05:18.648
All right, focus group.

05:18.683 --> 05:19.933
- Oh!
- Time for tasting.

05:19.967 --> 05:21.001
Tacos!

05:21.035 --> 05:22.836
- Ooh!
- Uh, hey, dude.

05:22.870 --> 05:24.771
When do I get to paint the truck for you?

05:24.806 --> 05:26.606
I could come up with a pretty sweet logo.

05:26.641 --> 05:28.439
- Mm.
- As soon as I settle on a name.

05:28.440 --> 05:30.044
Oh sweetie, these are fantastic!

05:30.045 --> 05:31.562
- Mmm.
- So good.

05:31.596 --> 05:33.897
So there's this big metal
show tomorrow night at Dogville

05:33.932 --> 05:36.500
that lets out at 11, and I was thinking

05:36.534 --> 05:38.902
zveryone's gonna be really
hungry and really drun...

05:38.937 --> 05:40.637
Mm, really happy!

05:40.672 --> 05:42.706
Yeah, and um, that would be

05:42.740 --> 05:44.641
a good place for the taco truck's

05:44.676 --> 05:45.809
maiden voyage.

05:45.843 --> 05:47.878
Honey, are you sure this is a good idea?

05:47.912 --> 05:48.979
Yeah. Why wouldn't it be?

05:49.013 --> 05:51.648
- Well...
- Wait, have you thought about permits?

05:51.683 --> 05:52.749
Yes.

05:52.784 --> 05:55.485
Um... I think it might be a better idea

05:55.520 --> 05:57.487
to park the truck over at the car wash,

05:57.522 --> 06:00.524
and sort of ease into things, right?

06:00.558 --> 06:02.526
It gives me a chance to call
my friend at the precinct office

06:02.560 --> 06:03.627
and ask about the permits.

06:03.661 --> 06:05.796
That's really nice, but I wanted to...

06:06.033 --> 06:07.734
Bay can help with the artwork.

06:07.768 --> 06:09.002
And I'll help with the truck.

06:09.036 --> 06:10.904
Except I have to write that press release.

06:10.938 --> 06:12.005
Uh, Toby can help.

06:12.039 --> 06:13.940
Yeah yeah yeah, it'll be a family affair.

06:13.974 --> 06:15.041
If I were you,

06:15.075 --> 06:17.977
I would just wave the white flag.

06:18.012 --> 06:20.013
Mom, what's the press release for?

06:20.047 --> 06:21.981
Um...

06:22.016 --> 06:23.716
well, uh,

06:23.751 --> 06:25.718
- you know, I...
- Your father...

06:25.752 --> 06:27.820
is gonna run for State Sen...

06:27.855 --> 06:29.122
- Senator?!
- Senator!

06:29.156 --> 06:30.756
That's the plan.

06:30.774 --> 06:31.925
- Great.
- Cool.

06:31.959 --> 06:33.092
That's fantastic!

06:33.127 --> 06:35.762
Yeah! And I'm gonna
help with the fundraising

06:35.796 --> 06:37.864
and writing the press materials.

06:37.898 --> 06:38.865
Do we get bodyguards?

06:38.899 --> 06:40.033
It's State Senate.

06:40.067 --> 06:41.801
I don't think any level of Senators' kids

06:41.835 --> 06:43.703
- gets bodyguards.
- Aw, man.

06:43.737 --> 06:45.672
So, uh, if we're all done here,

06:45.706 --> 06:47.707
I'm just gonna go get ready for rehearsal.

06:47.741 --> 06:48.975
You're rehearsing again?

06:49.009 --> 06:52.045
Guess when your girlfriend's
in the band you "rehearse"

06:52.079 --> 06:53.746
a whole lot more.

06:53.781 --> 06:55.748
Wait. Girlfriend?

06:55.783 --> 06:56.716
Gotta go.

06:56.750 --> 06:57.850
Wait wait wait wait wait!

06:57.885 --> 07:00.586
We wanted to make sure that
you guys are okay with this.

07:00.604 --> 07:01.788
- Yeah. Congrats.
- Sounds great. - Yeah.

07:01.822 --> 07:02.755
Good luck.

07:02.790 --> 07:04.624
Um...

07:04.658 --> 07:07.226
So that's all I get?

07:16.310 --> 07:19.278
Are we going to rehearse?

07:19.313 --> 07:21.214
Or should I put my guitar down?

07:22.916 --> 07:24.117
Oh, right.

07:24.151 --> 07:25.785
I was gonna get microphones.

07:25.819 --> 07:27.053
Right. Well, hang on.

07:27.087 --> 07:28.888
This is good too.

07:38.465 --> 07:40.733
You know, lately...

07:41.869 --> 07:43.836
I just feel like I've been getting

07:43.871 --> 07:46.539
some mixed signals.

07:46.573 --> 07:48.641
I'm sorry.

07:48.675 --> 07:52.478
I... I really want to, but...

07:52.513 --> 07:54.414
You took that pledge.

07:54.448 --> 07:56.349
Yeah.

07:56.383 --> 07:59.018
I just don't understand when
you really care about somebody

07:59.053 --> 08:02.889
and they really care about you,
why sex has to be a bad thing.

08:02.923 --> 08:05.058
It's not a bad thing.

08:05.092 --> 08:07.093
It's just...

08:07.127 --> 08:10.963
I kind of want the next time I do it

08:10.998 --> 08:14.600
to be with the person that
I'm going to be with forever.

08:21.358 --> 08:24.210
Hi. I'm sorry.

08:24.244 --> 08:25.178
Am I interrupting you?

08:25.212 --> 08:27.096
No, not at all.

08:27.147 --> 08:28.364
Well, I made these biscotti.

08:28.415 --> 08:30.349
And it's my first attempt,
so I thought you might

08:30.384 --> 08:31.384
wanna try them.

08:31.418 --> 08:33.436
- That looks amazing.
- Thanks.

08:33.470 --> 08:35.254
So what are you working on?

08:35.289 --> 08:37.190
Oh, just some new material.

08:37.224 --> 08:38.991
Trying to figure out what we're gonna play

08:39.025 --> 08:41.059
for that recording session.

08:41.095 --> 08:43.174
Oh, you mean with that
producer from the Frozen Lips.

08:43.197 --> 08:44.163
Flaming Lips, mom.

08:44.198 --> 08:45.131
Oh.

08:45.165 --> 08:46.966
Which is just as arbitrary.

08:47.000 --> 08:48.701
Well, can I hear something?

08:48.735 --> 08:50.736
You know, mom, um, these are delicious,

08:50.771 --> 08:53.773
but making me pretty thirsty.

08:53.807 --> 08:56.342
I know, it's kinda dry. Maybe
you should make us some tea.

08:56.376 --> 08:57.310
You want some tea?

08:57.344 --> 08:59.278
Yeah.

08:59.313 --> 09:00.346
Okay.

09:00.380 --> 09:02.315
I'll be right back.

09:03.450 --> 09:05.384
So can I hear it?

09:05.419 --> 09:07.453
Yeah. Sure.

09:43.657 --> 09:46.292
we should put her on the recording.

09:46.326 --> 09:47.426
No.

09:47.461 --> 09:49.011
- No.
- Yes. No, really.

09:49.046 --> 09:50.526
Don't you think she would sound great?

09:52.099 --> 09:53.266
Yeah, why not?

09:53.300 --> 09:54.934
Really?!

09:54.968 --> 09:56.002
Yeah.

09:56.036 --> 09:57.870
That sounds like fun.

10:03.010 --> 10:06.696
Hey. Uh...

10:06.730 --> 10:10.750
I haven't had to pick out what to
wear to school since I was four.

10:12.730 --> 10:14.907
_

10:14.909 --> 10:16.372
Really?

10:16.423 --> 10:18.758
You don't think that it's too fancy?

10:18.792 --> 10:22.628
I mean, I don't see a
lot of girls in dresses.

10:23.631 --> 10:26.682
_

10:28.033 --> 10:31.437
_

10:31.438 --> 10:33.256
Oh, believe it, buddy.

10:33.290 --> 10:36.259
And I have the crappy
student I.D. to prove it.

10:38.302 --> 10:40.551
_

10:41.181 --> 10:44.016
If that was serial
killer, then you nailed it.

10:44.034 --> 10:46.052
She took the picture on one and a half.

10:46.086 --> 10:47.853
It was definitely not three.

10:58.832 --> 11:00.600
What did you just do?

11:01.770 --> 11:04.804
_

11:04.805 --> 11:06.639
Um, have you met the office lady?

11:06.673 --> 11:08.574
There is no way that she's buying that.

11:09.054 --> 11:11.580
_

11:11.581 --> 11:13.687
_

11:14.481 --> 11:15.448
I will.

11:25.938 --> 11:29.658
Hey, you one of the newbies?

11:29.692 --> 11:30.876
And you just answered my question.

11:30.910 --> 11:33.395
Hello, fellow hearing person.

11:33.429 --> 11:35.330
Are you headed to basic asl?

11:35.364 --> 11:36.565
Yes.

11:36.599 --> 11:37.599
Care for an escort?

11:37.633 --> 11:38.700
Sure.

11:38.735 --> 11:40.435
I'm Teo.

11:40.453 --> 11:42.437
Oh, wait. Um...

11:48.144 --> 11:49.411
Your name is Bat?

11:49.445 --> 11:51.179
Like Batgirl? Ugh, I wish.

11:51.214 --> 11:52.948
No. It's Bay.

11:52.982 --> 11:54.883
As in "large body of water."

11:54.917 --> 11:56.017
Okay. Cool.

11:56.052 --> 11:57.152
Um, I think it's this way.

11:58.167 --> 12:00.786
I just don't understand.

12:00.820 --> 12:02.738
First it's that nurse from the
hospital he had a fling with,

12:02.772 --> 12:04.706
and now this girl on a plane?

12:04.741 --> 12:06.541
- Is he...
- Completely weak and narcissistic?

12:06.576 --> 12:07.809
- Yes.
- I was gonna say

12:07.844 --> 12:10.412
- A sex addict.
- I'm sorry.

12:10.446 --> 12:12.614
I feel like I've been apologizing
for Angelo for a long time

12:12.648 --> 12:15.250
and I'm kinda getting tired of it.

12:15.284 --> 12:17.552
You don't have to apologize for him.

12:17.587 --> 12:19.354
Thank you.

12:19.388 --> 12:21.223
If you don't mind,

12:21.257 --> 12:23.024
I'd like to tell Bay.

12:23.059 --> 12:24.259
Oh, God, Bay.

12:24.293 --> 12:26.027
Yeah.

12:26.062 --> 12:27.763
It just keeps getting better.

12:37.573 --> 12:38.640
Help.

12:38.674 --> 12:40.074
Got the letter "A." That's about it.

12:41.230 --> 12:42.545
_

12:42.578 --> 12:44.546
Uh...

12:44.580 --> 12:46.348
every tenth word or so.

12:46.349 --> 12:49.751
_

12:50.846 --> 12:53.687
_

12:56.330 --> 12:57.339
_

12:58.895 --> 12:59.878
Got it. Thanks.

12:59.929 --> 13:03.765
We're just gonna, um... contemplate that.

13:06.002 --> 13:07.736
She said book. Something about the book.

13:07.770 --> 13:09.905
Well, that narrows it down.

13:16.370 --> 13:17.598
_

13:18.177 --> 13:19.948
_

13:21.492 --> 13:23.509
_

13:27.156 --> 13:28.156
Heading to lunch?

13:28.191 --> 13:30.091
No, I have to run a food truck errand.

13:30.126 --> 13:31.393
But I'll see you later.

13:32.395 --> 13:33.928
It's no problem.

13:33.946 --> 13:35.881
I can sit with Emmett or Teo...

13:35.915 --> 13:36.965
Or anyone.

13:36.966 --> 13:38.412
_

13:41.003 --> 13:41.970
What was that?

13:42.004 --> 13:43.104
Nothing.

13:43.139 --> 13:44.773
No, what?

13:44.807 --> 13:47.843
Uh, we didn't get through
all the material,

13:47.877 --> 13:49.744
so there's extra homework for tonight.

13:49.762 --> 13:51.446
Oh.

13:51.480 --> 13:53.514
I mean, we didn't mean
to slow things down.

13:55.618 --> 13:57.602
It's good to see you, mi amor.

13:57.653 --> 13:59.571
How are your mama and grandma?

13:59.605 --> 14:01.389
They're good. I'll have to tell them

14:01.424 --> 14:03.708
Felicia's place closed
down. They won't believe it.

14:03.743 --> 14:05.460
Just last month.

14:05.494 --> 14:08.213
So many places going under.

14:08.264 --> 14:09.331
But not you.

14:09.365 --> 14:11.633
Not yet. Gracias a dios.

14:11.651 --> 14:15.170
So what do you need 500 tortillas for?

14:15.204 --> 14:16.304
I'm starting a taco truck,

14:16.339 --> 14:18.440
and I had to have the
best tortillas in K.C.

14:20.526 --> 14:21.476
Sorry, mija.

14:21.510 --> 14:23.078
Do you have cash?

14:23.112 --> 14:25.180
Uh, yeah. I think so.

14:25.214 --> 14:26.248
No no, Javy.

14:26.282 --> 14:27.849
Nada sin dinero en efectivo.

14:27.884 --> 14:29.818
Come on, Lupe. Give us a break.

14:29.852 --> 14:32.220
No, you give me a break.
I told him no more credit.

14:32.255 --> 14:33.922
Cash up front.

14:33.956 --> 14:36.658
Sorry, I only have $23.

14:36.692 --> 14:37.959
That's fine. You pay me later.

14:39.662 --> 14:40.595
What was that?

14:40.630 --> 14:42.631
She's starting her own business.

14:42.665 --> 14:44.399
I am an investor.

14:44.433 --> 14:45.700
Oh, yeah? What business is that?

14:45.735 --> 14:47.535
Taco truck.

14:47.570 --> 14:48.503
Tacos la guera?

14:48.537 --> 14:49.471
Javy.

14:49.505 --> 14:51.139
Me llamo Daphne Vasquez.

14:51.173 --> 14:53.141
And I may be a white
girl, but I knew enough

14:53.175 --> 14:55.243
to get Lupe's tortillas.

14:55.278 --> 14:58.380
Come on, are you gonna make
me go back and tell Ramon

14:58.414 --> 15:00.348
that we got no bread for the dinner rush?

15:00.382 --> 15:02.851
Tell him to call me.

15:02.885 --> 15:03.852
Gracias, Lupe.

15:03.886 --> 15:05.920
Nice to meet you, Daphne Vasquez.

15:05.938 --> 15:07.923
Igualmente, Javy.

15:07.957 --> 15:11.026
I think his Uncle's place
is about to go under too.

15:11.060 --> 15:11.993
Oh, no.

15:12.028 --> 15:13.695
You're lucky you got out.

15:13.729 --> 15:14.796
Go.

15:14.830 --> 15:16.598
Have fun on that truck of yours.

15:27.200 --> 15:28.956
_

15:28.957 --> 15:33.726
_

15:34.417 --> 15:35.433
Hey.

15:35.468 --> 15:36.434
What's up?

15:38.702 --> 15:40.341
_

15:46.162 --> 15:49.731
Is that a chocolate milk?

15:49.765 --> 15:52.000
I love chocolate milk.

15:52.034 --> 15:55.937
And I love the sign for milk, you know?

15:55.972 --> 15:59.507
It's so, uh, instinctive.

15:59.542 --> 16:02.510
I mean, I love signs like that.

16:02.545 --> 16:03.845
You know? Signs like, uh,

16:03.879 --> 16:05.580
"pirate" or "broken."

16:05.614 --> 16:08.249
But then you get signs like

16:08.284 --> 16:10.418
"bathroom" or... or "ugly."

16:10.453 --> 16:13.388
And I'm like, "whoo, did someone drunk

16:13.406 --> 16:16.291
come up with that?"

16:22.383 --> 16:25.086
_

16:25.401 --> 16:28.870
Let's just say if I hadn't already read

16:28.904 --> 16:30.939
"the Scarlet Letter"...

16:30.973 --> 16:32.007
I'd be dead right now.

16:34.257 --> 16:37.464
_

16:39.515 --> 16:40.849
Uh... oh, no no.

16:40.883 --> 16:42.751
It's okay. You... you can go.

16:44.426 --> 16:45.939
_

16:46.988 --> 16:48.987
_

16:55.197 --> 16:57.499
Why didn't you tell me
I'm such a bad signer?

16:58.975 --> 17:00.460
_

17:00.469 --> 17:03.071
Emmett, I'm pretty bad.

17:03.494 --> 17:05.808
_

17:06.876 --> 17:08.943
Can I ask you something?

17:10.012 --> 17:11.913
What does this mean?

17:12.914 --> 17:14.150
_

17:14.151 --> 17:18.752
_

17:18.753 --> 17:19.954
Yeah yeah, I got it, I got it.

17:21.599 --> 17:22.478
_

17:28.569 --> 17:30.545
Ladies. How are you?

17:30.672 --> 17:32.022
I urge you to try my daughter's tacos.

17:32.057 --> 17:34.725
Oh, perfect! In the fridge.

17:38.663 --> 17:40.630
Well, looks like we're ready to roll

17:40.649 --> 17:41.970
without actually rolling anywhere.

17:43.568 --> 17:44.718
Do you think that people
are gonna wanna eat

17:44.753 --> 17:46.303
at the car wash?

17:46.338 --> 17:48.605
With "JK" on the job? I
wouldn't worry about it.

17:48.640 --> 17:50.207
Hi.

17:50.225 --> 17:51.308
I would like

17:51.343 --> 17:53.277
two of your outstanding shrimp tacos

17:53.311 --> 17:54.345
por favor.

17:54.379 --> 17:56.213
Coming right up. That'll be four bucks.

17:56.247 --> 17:58.115
$4? For shrimp?

17:58.149 --> 17:59.083
Is that too much?

17:59.117 --> 18:00.250
Sweetie, are you kidding?

18:00.285 --> 18:02.052
That's barely enough
to cover your overhead.

18:02.087 --> 18:04.822
Well, I don't have to
pay rent on anything.

18:04.856 --> 18:06.123
Wait, what about your
time and your expertise?

18:06.157 --> 18:07.224
You have to get paid for that, right?

18:07.258 --> 18:09.693
Where's your price list? Oh, here. Marker.

18:09.728 --> 18:11.929
All right, so this should be...

18:11.963 --> 18:14.832
Three. And shrimp, come on.

18:14.866 --> 18:15.866
It's gotta be like six, right?

18:15.900 --> 18:16.834
Boom!

18:16.868 --> 18:18.635
But it's street food.

18:18.670 --> 18:19.870
It's supposed to be cheap.

18:19.904 --> 18:21.405
Let's do a little experiment.

18:21.439 --> 18:22.706
That's what today's all about, right?

18:22.740 --> 18:25.642
Two shrimp tacos with
extra guac for the boss.

18:25.677 --> 18:26.643
Look at that.

18:26.678 --> 18:28.579
Definitely worth 12 bucks, right?

18:28.613 --> 18:31.315
In fact...

18:31.349 --> 18:32.282
keep the change.

18:32.317 --> 18:34.251
- Ohh.
- Toby, tip jar.

18:34.285 --> 18:35.252
Nice.

18:37.188 --> 18:39.323
Good news is now that
he's running for office,

18:39.357 --> 18:40.357
it'll slow him down.

18:40.392 --> 18:43.260
You can feed all of
the hungry, drunk people

18:43.294 --> 18:44.228
that you want to.

18:44.262 --> 18:45.962
Oh, hi.

18:45.980 --> 18:47.064
Can we help you?

18:51.002 --> 18:53.771
Daphne is a culinary genius.

18:53.805 --> 18:55.005
And she did not get it from me.

18:55.039 --> 18:56.540
It's pretty good, right?

18:56.574 --> 18:59.543
So, uh, how's it going at Carlton?

18:59.577 --> 19:01.412
Fine.

19:02.580 --> 19:04.415
Not fine.

19:04.449 --> 19:05.582
But please don't tell my parents.

19:05.617 --> 19:08.385
I really can't deal with an
"I told you so" right now.

19:08.420 --> 19:10.587
- What's going on?
- It's just kind of a rough start.

19:12.190 --> 19:13.357
You know how many deaf parties I went to

19:13.391 --> 19:15.292
with Melody where I
just nodded and smiled?

19:15.326 --> 19:18.195
Just give it time.

19:18.229 --> 19:20.030
Thanks.

19:20.064 --> 19:22.132
There's, um, something else

19:22.167 --> 19:23.834
that I needed to talk to you about.

19:23.868 --> 19:25.068
Sure. What's up?

19:25.103 --> 19:27.805
So it turns out that, um...

19:29.574 --> 19:32.543
Angelo has another...

19:32.577 --> 19:33.510
I know.

19:33.545 --> 19:35.412
You already knew?

19:35.447 --> 19:36.613
Yeah.

19:36.648 --> 19:37.747
When did he tell you?

19:39.451 --> 19:41.351
Well, Toby found out first

19:41.386 --> 19:44.121
and then Angelo and I

19:44.155 --> 19:46.457
got into this big fight
outside of my school.

19:46.491 --> 19:49.059
And I haven't spoken to him since.

19:50.228 --> 19:51.995
Well, now I know why he told me.

19:52.030 --> 19:53.030
He was caught.

19:53.064 --> 19:54.865
- I should have told you.
- No no no.

19:54.899 --> 19:56.800
This is not your problem.

19:58.870 --> 19:59.970
It's mine.

20:03.808 --> 20:04.942
It's mine.

20:04.976 --> 20:08.545
One, two, three.

20:08.563 --> 20:12.616
$253 on your first day.

20:12.650 --> 20:15.686
And I wasted all my time on fake IDs.

20:15.720 --> 20:17.387
Are you sure? That's crazy.

20:17.422 --> 20:21.124
You mind if I clear out? Uh, I told Nikki

20:21.159 --> 20:23.126
that I would meet her early for rehearsal.

20:23.161 --> 20:24.161
Mm.

20:24.195 --> 20:26.029
"Rehearsal" again, huh?

20:26.097 --> 20:27.965
I'm in a Christian rock band

20:27.999 --> 20:30.033
with my mom.

20:30.068 --> 20:32.069
Rehearsal is not a euphemism.

20:32.103 --> 20:33.871
Wait. Kathryn's in your band?

20:33.905 --> 20:36.006
For one song.

20:36.040 --> 20:37.808
Flaming Lips would not approve.

20:39.878 --> 20:40.911
You can go ahead.

20:40.945 --> 20:41.945
I'll take care of all this.

20:41.963 --> 20:43.947
- All right.
- Hey, wait.

20:43.982 --> 20:45.699
Half's yours.

20:45.733 --> 20:46.700
No.

20:47.919 --> 20:50.487
All you, taco girl.

21:05.370 --> 21:06.970
That rocked, you guys.

21:06.971 --> 21:09.571
_

21:10.208 --> 21:11.208
Yes, a gig would be good.

21:11.242 --> 21:13.010
Just as long as we keep

21:13.044 --> 21:14.878
my mom off the stage.

21:14.913 --> 21:16.813
You just watch. Your mom is going to be

21:16.848 --> 21:17.981
our secret weapon.

21:18.016 --> 21:19.816
Well, do we really need a secret weapon?

21:19.851 --> 21:21.852
I mean, we already have a deaf drummer.

21:23.688 --> 21:24.888
Nice.

21:24.923 --> 21:26.523
I gotta go. I'm gonna be late

21:26.557 --> 21:27.591
for youth group.

21:27.625 --> 21:29.393
I'll just come get that later.

21:29.427 --> 21:31.295
- Cool.
- Okay.

21:31.329 --> 21:32.296
Bye.

21:40.665 --> 21:42.585
_

21:43.141 --> 21:44.174
Yeah, what's up?

21:45.770 --> 21:48.921
_

21:48.922 --> 21:52.491
_

21:52.492 --> 21:53.892
_

21:54.141 --> 21:55.118
Wait wait wait. Uh, slow down

21:55.153 --> 21:56.853
just a little bit.

21:59.299 --> 22:01.050
_

22:01.051 --> 22:01.992
_

22:01.993 --> 22:03.460
Website.

22:03.461 --> 22:07.314
_

22:08.602 --> 22:10.786
_

22:11.436 --> 22:13.470
Okay. What picture?

22:16.018 --> 22:18.465
_

22:19.286 --> 22:22.284
_

22:24.015 --> 22:26.016
Nah, man. It's not her.

22:26.034 --> 22:28.151
Maybe somebody who looks like her?

22:43.626 --> 22:47.210
_

22:48.239 --> 22:49.406
No, man.

22:49.440 --> 22:51.108
You did the right thing.

22:55.433 --> 22:57.545
_

22:57.546 --> 23:00.097
_

23:00.098 --> 23:01.298
_

23:01.299 --> 23:04.232
_

23:04.255 --> 23:05.355
Can we just talk?

23:05.356 --> 23:06.640
_

23:06.924 --> 23:08.008
You know what I mean.

23:08.009 --> 23:09.212
Okay, fine.

23:09.230 --> 23:10.814
It is so weird being the outsider.

23:10.848 --> 23:13.033
I mean, especially for
me, being a white boy.

23:13.084 --> 23:15.035
I mean, I have absolutely
no outsider status.

23:15.086 --> 23:16.920
Well, it's good for you.

23:16.955 --> 23:18.055
Oh, absolutely.

23:18.089 --> 23:20.023
But have you noticed how we're sort of

23:20.057 --> 23:23.543
persona non grata? Or personae non grata?

23:23.578 --> 23:26.697
Or whatever. It means they
don't really dig us being here.

23:26.731 --> 23:27.848
I guess they just don't want us around.

23:27.882 --> 23:28.932
But whatever, you know?

23:28.967 --> 23:30.901
We'll just stay out of their way.

23:30.935 --> 23:32.603
Passive resistance.

23:32.637 --> 23:34.571
Mm, that's very zen of you.

23:35.707 --> 23:38.742
All right, guys. No serves
in front of the line.

23:38.776 --> 23:40.577
And you're both on that team.

23:54.712 --> 23:56.186
_

24:05.253 --> 24:06.236
Hey!

24:10.274 --> 24:12.376
Whoa!

24:12.410 --> 24:13.377
Same team.

24:17.348 --> 24:18.982
Passive resistance, huh?

24:19.017 --> 24:20.117
Might wanna try the active kind.

24:20.151 --> 24:21.284
Your serve.

24:29.861 --> 24:31.928
Teo. Duck.

24:35.533 --> 24:36.483
Out of my class.

24:36.534 --> 24:37.868
I'm sorry. My hand slipped.

24:37.902 --> 24:38.869
Get out.

24:49.810 --> 24:51.570
_

24:51.571 --> 24:55.595
_

24:55.596 --> 24:57.976
_

24:57.977 --> 25:00.148
_

25:00.149 --> 25:01.884
_

25:01.885 --> 25:04.697
_

25:04.698 --> 25:06.609
_

25:06.610 --> 25:09.811
_

25:09.812 --> 25:13.144
_

25:13.145 --> 25:16.533
_

25:16.534 --> 25:18.134
_

25:21.392 --> 25:22.992
_

25:26.397 --> 25:28.079
_

25:29.469 --> 25:31.069
_

25:38.463 --> 25:39.656
_

26:01.418 --> 26:02.791
_

26:02.792 --> 26:05.861
Apparently, I can actually throw a
volleyball with incredible accuracy.

26:06.963 --> 26:09.848
Natalie was being a volley-bitch,

26:09.899 --> 26:12.534
so I "eye-for-an-eye" d her.

26:14.140 --> 26:16.071
_

26:16.073 --> 26:18.573
She hates me for no reason

26:18.608 --> 26:20.225
other than the fact that I'm hearing.

26:23.711 --> 26:26.129
_

26:26.130 --> 26:28.888
_

26:37.627 --> 26:39.661
Hey. Can I help?

26:39.695 --> 26:41.596
Thanks.

26:41.631 --> 26:43.598
So...

26:43.633 --> 26:44.766
I was thinking

26:44.800 --> 26:47.402
if we're gonna make this
like a regular thing,

26:47.436 --> 26:49.354
I can get some tables and build an awning

26:49.388 --> 26:50.438
and put them right over there...

26:50.473 --> 26:51.506
This isn't for the car wash.

26:51.541 --> 26:53.208
I'm taking the truck to East Riverside.

26:53.242 --> 26:55.443
Oh, we should, uh... we
should talk about that.

26:55.478 --> 26:57.479
There's nothing to talk
about. I'll be fine.

26:57.513 --> 27:00.248
W... wait, sweetie, we
agreed on the car wash.

27:00.283 --> 27:02.317
Not East Riverside.

27:02.351 --> 27:04.252
Why? Because it's poor?

27:04.287 --> 27:06.188
Because I lived there for 15 years,

27:06.222 --> 27:07.956
and nothing bad ever
happened to... damn it!

27:07.990 --> 27:09.024
Oh, here.

27:09.058 --> 27:10.892
Stop helping me!

27:10.927 --> 27:12.761
If I make a mess, I'll clean it up myself.

27:20.603 --> 27:21.570
I'm sorry.

27:21.604 --> 27:23.705
No, sweetie, I'm sorry if...

27:23.739 --> 27:25.607
I said or did anything.

27:27.577 --> 27:31.112
I have a food truck that sells $6 tacos.

27:31.147 --> 27:35.150
And people in East Riverside can
barely hold their lives together.

27:35.184 --> 27:36.885
A year ago that was me.

27:36.919 --> 27:40.171
Look, I...

27:40.223 --> 27:44.759
I think taking the truck
to your old neighborhood

27:44.794 --> 27:46.027
is a good idea, but...

27:46.062 --> 27:47.762
Then let me do it.

27:47.797 --> 27:49.764
My way.

27:49.799 --> 27:51.700
Let me charge what I wanna charge.

27:51.734 --> 27:53.468
Or not charge anything at all.

27:53.502 --> 27:55.804
What, you're gonna go out there
and just give it away for free?

27:55.838 --> 27:57.272
Look, I know that

27:57.306 --> 27:58.673
I let you down a lot lately,

27:58.708 --> 28:00.442
and I made some stupid decisions

28:00.476 --> 28:04.346
and I ruined a great opportunity.

28:04.380 --> 28:08.250
I just wanna do something
that actually makes sense.

28:10.953 --> 28:15.056
Well, if you're gonna do this...

28:15.091 --> 28:17.192
then I'm coming with you.

28:20.763 --> 28:21.896
It's non-negotiable.

28:21.931 --> 28:24.599
Now, may I... may I help?

28:24.634 --> 28:25.967
- Yes.
- Okay.

28:38.314 --> 28:39.314
Thanks.

28:39.348 --> 28:40.632
No problem.

28:52.261 --> 28:54.062
How far along are you?

28:54.096 --> 28:55.864
Oh, six and a half months.

28:55.898 --> 28:58.066
Ah, the rose period.

28:59.869 --> 29:01.670
I loved being pregnant.

29:01.704 --> 29:02.837
How many kids do you have?

29:02.872 --> 29:04.873
Two, but just one pregnancy.

29:04.907 --> 29:06.808
It's complicated.

29:10.613 --> 29:11.579
Girl or boy?

29:11.614 --> 29:13.348
- A girl.
- Oh.

29:13.382 --> 29:14.582
Exciting.

29:18.454 --> 29:19.454
What do you do?

29:19.488 --> 29:21.089
I'm in med school.

29:21.123 --> 29:22.490
Wow.

29:22.525 --> 29:24.993
- Yup.
- You're busy.

29:25.027 --> 29:26.061
Multitasking.

29:26.095 --> 29:27.929
- I'll say.
- Yeah.

29:29.131 --> 29:32.067
Oh, there she goes.

29:32.101 --> 29:34.836
It's the craziest thing.

29:34.870 --> 29:36.738
It really is.

29:36.772 --> 29:38.673
Yeah.

29:41.110 --> 29:42.777
- Are you getting off?
- Oh, no.

29:42.812 --> 29:43.845
I just forgot to hit the button.

29:43.879 --> 29:45.647
- I'm going up.
- Okay.

29:45.681 --> 29:46.961
- Well, good night.
- Good night.

29:53.889 --> 29:56.791
So you wanna plug into the
amp or straight into the board?

29:56.826 --> 29:58.426
You're really, uh,

29:58.461 --> 30:00.462
getting down to business this time, huh?

30:00.496 --> 30:02.497
Is that cool?

30:02.531 --> 30:04.265
Yeah.

30:04.300 --> 30:06.101
Sure.

30:06.135 --> 30:08.203
Um, I'll just plug into the amp.

30:08.237 --> 30:09.371
There you go.

30:17.012 --> 30:19.881
Is this because I was so nice to your mom?

30:19.915 --> 30:21.916
Is that what's going on?

30:21.951 --> 30:23.118
There's nothing going on.

30:23.152 --> 30:25.053
Okay.

30:28.858 --> 30:32.527
Sorry, it's just, um...

30:32.561 --> 30:34.796
Emmett was updating our website,

30:34.830 --> 30:36.865
and I guess some idiot
posted a picture of you.

30:36.899 --> 30:39.401
- What picture?
- You were at some party.

30:39.435 --> 30:40.368
You had purple in your hair.

30:40.403 --> 30:42.637
Oh.

30:42.671 --> 30:44.672
That.

30:44.707 --> 30:46.441
Um.

30:46.475 --> 30:48.209
It was freshman year.

30:48.244 --> 30:49.244
You don't need to explain.

30:49.278 --> 30:50.311
Well, obviously I do.

30:51.480 --> 30:54.115
It was after my dad died.

30:54.150 --> 30:56.217
And things were out of control,

30:56.252 --> 30:59.020
and I got really drunk and
some idiot had a camera...

30:59.088 --> 31:00.422
And who was that? Jed?

31:00.456 --> 31:03.725
Is he pissed at you for breaking
up with him and this is his revenge?

31:03.759 --> 31:04.859
Jed didn't post it.

31:04.894 --> 31:06.828
- Well then, who did?
- What does it matter?

31:06.862 --> 31:08.663
It's just some stupid picture.

31:08.697 --> 31:09.864
Okay.

31:09.899 --> 31:12.534
Well, that's very admirable of you, but...

31:12.568 --> 31:14.636
But what, Toby? If you
wanna break up with me

31:14.670 --> 31:16.738
because I took my shirt off
at a party two years ago...

31:16.772 --> 31:18.339
I don't wanna break up with you.

31:18.374 --> 31:19.591
It's just a little confusing.

31:19.625 --> 31:21.543
Why? Because I'm Christian

31:21.577 --> 31:23.244
or because I won't sleep with you?

31:31.353 --> 31:32.320
Nikki, come on.

31:32.354 --> 31:34.289
I'm not going to apologize to you!

31:34.323 --> 31:36.991
Or anyone else for who I was.

31:37.026 --> 31:38.293
I was going through a hard time.

31:38.327 --> 31:40.962
And that's how I dealt with it.

31:40.996 --> 31:42.764
I'm different now.

31:42.798 --> 31:45.733
If that's not enough for you...

31:45.768 --> 31:47.702
I don't know what to tell you.

31:51.874 --> 31:53.808
Come on.

32:05.619 --> 32:06.652
Do you have a marker?

32:06.686 --> 32:08.454
Um, yeah.

32:10.523 --> 32:13.259
Here you go.

32:26.973 --> 32:28.207
Hi, how can I help you?

32:29.209 --> 32:30.843
Two shrimp? Okay.

32:30.877 --> 32:32.795
Thank you.

32:34.714 --> 32:35.998
Hey hey, * 10 bucks *

32:36.032 --> 32:37.817
Hey! Two, yeah.

32:37.851 --> 32:38.768
Two veggie please.

32:38.802 --> 32:39.885
Need some hot sauce, sir?

32:42.622 --> 32:43.706
Thank you so much.

32:43.740 --> 32:46.492
Who's next?

32:46.526 --> 32:47.560
Hi, one shrimp please.

32:47.594 --> 32:48.794
One shrimp coming up.

32:52.866 --> 32:54.667
Hey! Javy, right?

32:54.701 --> 32:57.302
- Yeah.
- What can I get for you?

32:57.320 --> 32:59.305
You can get your toy truck
out of my neighborhood.

32:59.339 --> 33:00.439
Is there a problem?

33:00.474 --> 33:01.440
Yeah.

33:01.475 --> 33:03.042
You wanna be a taco fairy?

33:03.076 --> 33:04.310
Go do it in your own neighborhood.

33:04.344 --> 33:05.277
Entiendes?

33:07.147 --> 33:08.914
Hey, can I help you?

33:08.949 --> 33:10.850
No.

33:10.884 --> 33:12.184
She already got my order.

33:14.154 --> 33:15.921
Sweetie, come here.

33:15.956 --> 33:17.156
We're almost out of the shrimp.

33:17.190 --> 33:18.858
I think we should wrap it up here.

33:22.012 --> 33:23.596
Do you mind?

33:23.630 --> 33:24.763
There's that fish place two blocks over.

33:24.798 --> 33:26.499
He stays open late.

33:26.533 --> 33:28.767
I'm not gonna take whatever
little money you've made tonight

33:28.802 --> 33:30.736
and go buy more stuff for
you to give away for free.

33:30.770 --> 33:32.404
That doesn't make any sense.

33:32.439 --> 33:34.540
Even Karl Marx would find that boneheaded.

33:34.574 --> 33:36.392
All these people are waiting.

33:36.443 --> 33:38.477
You said we would do this my way.

33:40.313 --> 33:41.447
Okay.

33:41.481 --> 33:43.449
I will pay for the shrimp.

33:43.483 --> 33:45.951
You gonna be okay?

33:45.986 --> 33:47.152
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

33:52.392 --> 33:53.325
Who's next?

33:56.296 --> 33:58.063
Hey, honey.

33:58.097 --> 34:00.165
How was the rest of your rehearsal?

34:00.200 --> 34:02.001
Fine.

34:02.035 --> 34:03.135
That Nikki is great.

34:03.169 --> 34:06.605
I am so happy to see you
with someone like her.

34:06.640 --> 34:08.059
She's so sweet. No guile.

34:09.775 --> 34:11.610
And I love singing with you guys.

34:11.645 --> 34:12.844
I know we're not gonna
take the show on the road,

34:12.879 --> 34:14.413
but if you need any help...

34:14.447 --> 34:15.547
Mom, it's a one-time thing.

34:15.581 --> 34:16.514
You're not in the band.

34:17.516 --> 34:19.284
Okay, what's going on with you?

34:20.587 --> 34:24.188
Somebody posted a picture of Nikki

34:24.224 --> 34:25.391
on the band website.

34:25.425 --> 34:29.295
She's at a party and she's, you know...

34:29.329 --> 34:32.130
Posting those kinds of pictures of kids

34:32.165 --> 34:34.800
is illegal. People go to jail for that.

34:34.833 --> 34:35.900
That's not the point. The point is

34:35.936 --> 34:38.771
it's my girlfriend in
not a lot of clothing

34:38.804 --> 34:39.938
on the Internet.

34:39.973 --> 34:41.766
Ah.

34:41.768 --> 34:43.902
So I guess you're lucky
that there was no one around

34:43.937 --> 34:46.605
with a camera when you
were selling stolen tests,

34:46.639 --> 34:49.408
making fake I.Ds with Wilke

34:49.442 --> 34:51.342
or when you were selling your equipment

34:51.378 --> 34:53.212
to pay for your gambling debts.

34:53.246 --> 34:55.313
Okay, yeah. Point made.

34:55.348 --> 34:57.216
Look, honey,

34:57.250 --> 35:00.119
I know trust is hard.

35:00.153 --> 35:03.188
But you can either trust your own sense

35:03.223 --> 35:06.292
of who Nikki is or some creep who posted

35:06.326 --> 35:08.060
pictures of her on the Internet.

35:08.094 --> 35:10.162
It's your choice.

35:12.032 --> 35:14.567
And...

35:14.601 --> 35:15.901
I know I'm not in the band.

35:17.737 --> 35:19.638
I just like singing with you.

35:49.936 --> 35:51.170
Hey.

35:51.204 --> 35:53.172
Hey!

35:54.062 --> 35:55.546
What did you do to my truck?

35:55.597 --> 35:56.847
I told you to go home.

35:56.882 --> 35:58.816
Seriously? I'm giving away free food

35:58.867 --> 36:00.601
and you're gonna mess with me?

36:00.619 --> 36:02.736
You come over here handing
out dinner, and guess what?

36:02.771 --> 36:04.605
My Uncle's place don't do any business

36:04.639 --> 36:05.739
and we all go home early

36:05.774 --> 36:08.309
with nothing. You think of that?

36:08.343 --> 36:09.543
Of course not.

36:09.578 --> 36:11.579
I am not the bad guy
here! I'm trying to help!

36:11.613 --> 36:15.149
Then don't come around here throwing
scraps, 'cause you feel guilty.

36:15.183 --> 36:16.383
That's not helping us.

36:16.418 --> 36:18.319
That's just helping you.

36:18.353 --> 36:21.088
Lupe told me your Uncle's
place was about to go under.

36:21.122 --> 36:24.024
So don't go blaming my little
taco truck for your bad business.

36:24.059 --> 36:25.359
You're just lying to yourself.

36:25.393 --> 36:28.195
Thank you for your
astute business assessment

36:28.230 --> 36:30.831
after exactly three hours back here.

36:34.069 --> 36:35.052
Damn it!

36:44.323 --> 36:47.993
Look, there's always
gonna be some kind of jerk

36:48.027 --> 36:49.995
who wants to punish you
for doing the right thing.

36:55.001 --> 36:56.234
Sweetie,

36:56.269 --> 36:59.905
none of those people
went home hungry tonight.

36:59.939 --> 37:01.773
That is what you wanted to do,

37:01.807 --> 37:02.774
and you did it.

37:06.546 --> 37:11.316
What did either of us do
to deserve all of this?

37:13.286 --> 37:15.420
Well, I...

37:15.454 --> 37:17.389
I worked hard for this.

37:17.423 --> 37:20.458
No, you were just lucky.

37:20.493 --> 37:23.328
Talented and smart and determined...

37:23.362 --> 37:25.397
but also just lucky.

37:25.431 --> 37:29.367
To be born in this country, to have
parents who were educated and not have to

37:29.402 --> 37:33.004
worry about anything but what
you wanted to be when you grew up.

37:36.842 --> 37:37.842
That's true.

37:37.877 --> 37:41.646
It's all just luck.

37:41.681 --> 37:42.981
Whether you're deaf or hearing,

37:43.015 --> 37:44.950
tall or short...

37:44.984 --> 37:47.786
if you could shoot hoops or create art,

37:47.820 --> 37:51.489
so much of what defines
us is just dumb luck.

37:51.524 --> 37:54.526
And don't say it's what you do
with the dumb luck that counts.

37:54.560 --> 37:56.595
But it is.

37:58.614 --> 38:00.565
I wanna do more with my dumb luck

38:00.600 --> 38:02.467
and I don't know how.

38:11.110 --> 38:13.945
You really are your mother's daughter.

38:19.051 --> 38:22.787
So I am gonna make you

38:22.822 --> 38:25.023
something to eat,

38:25.057 --> 38:27.993
or maybe better...

38:28.027 --> 38:30.962
heat up something your
mother already made.

38:48.313 --> 38:49.447
I can't talk.

38:49.481 --> 38:50.415
I know.

38:50.449 --> 38:53.351
I just wanted to say that, uh,

38:53.386 --> 38:55.220
I don't care if you've
dyed your hair purple

38:55.254 --> 38:56.988
or went to some stupid party,

38:57.023 --> 38:59.924
'cause I've done a lot
of things that I regret.

38:59.959 --> 39:03.628
But I'm sorry, I just
can't get behind emoticons.

39:04.864 --> 39:06.831
How intolerant of you.

39:08.934 --> 39:10.468
You should see the moon.

39:10.503 --> 39:12.737
Looks really good from the parking lot.

39:12.772 --> 39:14.406
What?

39:14.440 --> 39:17.342
Wait, are you...?

39:21.280 --> 39:22.213
There you are.

39:23.249 --> 39:25.150
Here I am.

39:31.957 --> 39:33.892
Are you kidding me with this guy?

39:33.926 --> 39:35.894
It took us four years to
get pregnant with Toby.

39:35.928 --> 39:39.097
This guy knocks up everything
he looks at just like that.

39:39.131 --> 39:41.833
Welcome to the next installment of

39:41.867 --> 39:44.135
"as the Kennish world turns."

39:44.170 --> 39:46.938
Oh, in other news...

39:46.972 --> 39:49.641
Boom.

39:50.810 --> 39:52.711
- Hey!
- Yeah!

39:52.745 --> 39:54.846
- Mm!
- Ha ha!

39:54.880 --> 39:56.781
Yeah, no turning back now.

39:56.816 --> 39:57.816
Are you sure you wanna do this?

39:57.850 --> 40:01.352
I don't want it to be because I made you.

40:01.387 --> 40:03.722
Oh, come on. It's not.

40:03.756 --> 40:06.391
Look, I have no idea

40:06.425 --> 40:09.260
how this is all gonna turn out,

40:09.295 --> 40:12.163
but, you know, we're so lucky.

40:12.198 --> 40:16.067
I mean, we have so much and...

40:17.236 --> 40:19.137
I don't know.

40:19.171 --> 40:20.271
I agree.

40:22.141 --> 40:23.842
I gotta go to bed.

40:25.044 --> 40:27.712
- I'll clean this up.
- Oh, you're a gem.

40:27.747 --> 40:28.980
Good night, Hillary.

40:29.014 --> 40:30.682
Good night, Bill.

40:52.371 --> 40:53.671
Hey.

40:55.674 --> 40:56.641
Whoa, there.

41:00.246 --> 41:03.114
Look, I'm sorry about yesterday.

41:05.384 --> 41:06.885
But you have to agree,

41:06.919 --> 41:09.154
you were asking for it.

41:11.157 --> 41:12.757
Are you okay?

41:14.960 --> 41:16.795
Okay. Great.

41:16.829 --> 41:18.596
Because I, uh, wouldn't want

41:18.631 --> 41:21.499
"almost killed somebody" on my record.

41:21.534 --> 41:22.534
Colleges hate that.

41:23.769 --> 41:25.386
Okay. All right, I'm sorry.

41:25.437 --> 41:26.638
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

41:26.672 --> 41:29.407
Bad joke. Okay.

41:29.441 --> 41:34.512
Do you think that maybe
we could just start over?

41:36.415 --> 41:39.134
All right, look, I don't
know what your deal is.

41:39.168 --> 41:41.452
If this is something about Emmett or...

41:43.170 --> 41:47.773

41:47.774 --> 41:51.062

41:51.063 --> 41:53.711
_

41:53.712 --> 41:57.912
_

42:01.035 --> 42:03.868
I'm sorry. I don't want that. I'm just...

42:03.869 --> 42:07.470
