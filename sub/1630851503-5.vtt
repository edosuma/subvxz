00:04.038 --> 00:06.040
Hey, Dad,
why'd you get a bag

00:06.074 --> 00:07.741
of the big candy bars
for Halloween?

00:07.775 --> 00:09.310
I told you fun-sized.

00:09.343 --> 00:12.380
You and I might have
a different definition of "fun."

00:13.181 --> 00:16.584
Louise and I lost our honeymoon
to roof repairs.

00:16.617 --> 00:19.687
Big disappointments
require big candy.

00:20.554 --> 00:23.791
Okay, well, enjoy the fun
of big diabetes.

00:24.992 --> 00:26.960
Ah, screw it,
I'll join you.

00:28.829 --> 00:33.067
So...how are things
at the hardware store?

00:33.101 --> 00:35.002
I don't think
Ben's dating anyone,

00:35.035 --> 00:37.271
which is what
you're really asking about,

00:37.305 --> 00:40.007
but don't, because I don't
want to be in the middle.

00:40.040 --> 00:42.343
No, I was asking about
the hardware store.

00:42.376 --> 00:44.445
But since
you brought it up,

00:44.478 --> 00:48.416
you could tell me if he has,
you know, sad eyes.

00:48.449 --> 00:50.118
I don't even know
if he has eyes.

00:50.151 --> 00:52.553
We're men. We don't look
in each other's eyes.

00:54.222 --> 00:55.456
You've got to move on.

00:55.489 --> 00:57.758
I know, I know.

01:01.028 --> 01:02.996
See, this is why
I don't look in people's eyes.

01:03.030 --> 01:05.399
You look sad.

01:06.200 --> 01:08.469
You mind going in the kitchen
and doing that?

01:12.506 --> 01:14.608
Don't bring those sad eyes
in here.

01:14.642 --> 01:17.645
Sorry.
They've got to go somewhere.

01:19.380 --> 01:21.115
So, how's Aldo?

01:21.149 --> 01:23.584
He's still old,
he's still tattooed,

01:23.617 --> 01:25.085
and I'm still into it.

01:25.119 --> 01:28.189
Hey, we haven't even
talked about Aldo --

01:28.222 --> 01:30.124
who, by the way,
will be 100

01:30.158 --> 01:33.227
when you are in the prime
of your life at 81 --

01:33.261 --> 01:35.329
so how about
we grab a bite

01:35.363 --> 01:37.731
and discuss him calmly
over lunch?

01:37.765 --> 01:39.533
There's nothing
to talk about.

01:39.567 --> 01:42.436
Come on. There's this vegan
place I really want to try.

01:42.470 --> 01:44.938
It's got this really cool,
Eastern Zen theme,

01:44.972 --> 01:46.039
and there's a bookstore

01:46.073 --> 01:48.409
that specializes
in spiritual wellness.

01:48.442 --> 01:49.677
Oh, so it's kind of like

01:49.710 --> 01:52.580
one-stop shopping for things
I find ridiculous.

01:52.613 --> 01:54.081
I'm hoping to find
a book there

01:54.114 --> 01:55.649
about how to not beat
my children

01:55.683 --> 01:57.451
when they're dismissive
and insulting.

01:58.652 --> 02:00.588
You know,
I was this close to going.

02:00.621 --> 02:02.690
Really?
No.

02:06.160 --> 02:07.728
Uh-uh-uh-uh.

02:07.761 --> 02:09.997
I know this looks like
an abandoned house

02:10.030 --> 02:12.600
from the outside,
but people actually live here,

02:12.633 --> 02:14.468
so take your nonsense
elsewhere.

02:14.502 --> 02:15.503
They're with me.

02:15.536 --> 02:17.205
They're Aldo's kids,
Melvin and Marvin.

02:17.238 --> 02:19.840
Oh.
Hi, I'm -- I'm Darlene.

02:23.777 --> 02:25.413
[ Chuckles ]

02:28.382 --> 02:31.485
Okay, so this is the part
of the horror movie

02:31.519 --> 02:33.454
where I know
something's terribly wrong,

02:33.487 --> 02:35.155
but nobody else gets it.

02:35.189 --> 02:38.826
You know, their predatory gaze
means they like you.

02:38.859 --> 02:40.594
Why are you babysitting
his kids?

02:40.628 --> 02:43.096
We don't need
a babysitter.

02:43.130 --> 02:45.466
We just need somebody
to say we were here.

02:48.101 --> 02:50.438
Delightful children.

02:50.471 --> 02:52.440
Harris, this is crazy.

02:52.473 --> 02:54.542
You're too young
to be playing stepmother.

02:54.575 --> 02:56.076
Where is
their actual mother?

02:56.109 --> 02:58.178
You know what?
I'm gonna go with "hiding."

02:58.212 --> 02:59.480
She's not allowed
to watch them.

02:59.513 --> 03:00.714
She's a drug addict.

03:00.748 --> 03:03.551
Oh, well, that's not gonna be
a problem down the line.

03:03.584 --> 03:05.152
Look, I don't have time
to argue.

03:05.185 --> 03:07.020
I have to go walk
them through the metal
detector at school.

03:07.054 --> 03:08.856
Oh, wow.

03:08.889 --> 03:10.558
All the kids
have to do that now?

03:10.591 --> 03:11.825
No.

You guys deserve
a honeymoon.

03:53.367 --> 03:57.204
How would you like to go
on a photo safari of Kenya,

03:57.237 --> 04:00.441
or travel on tall ships
in Amsterdam?

04:00.474 --> 04:03.176
I'm not carrying around
some one-percenter's luggage

04:03.210 --> 04:05.913
just so I can go someplace
I can't afford.

04:05.946 --> 04:09.383
But if it's old people
looking for a caregiver couple,

04:09.417 --> 04:12.286
I'll wipe a butt
for Amsterdam.

04:12.320 --> 04:13.987
You don't have to wipe
anything.

04:14.021 --> 04:15.956
All you have to do
is sit on the couch.

04:15.989 --> 04:17.591
Yeah,
it's virtual reality.

04:17.625 --> 04:20.628
Becky borrowed it from
somebody in her study
group for the week.

04:20.661 --> 04:22.262
So, you just put
the goggles on,

04:22.296 --> 04:23.631
go anywhere you want,

04:23.664 --> 04:26.266
and it'll feel like
you're actually there.

04:26.300 --> 04:28.469
I have stuff
in my medicine cabinet

04:28.502 --> 04:31.539
that will also take me
anywhere I want.

04:31.572 --> 04:34.642
It's already set up for
a canoe trip down the Amazon.

04:34.675 --> 04:36.744
Enjoy your honeymoon.

04:36.777 --> 04:40.348
Holy crap, Louise.
Are you seeing this?

04:40.381 --> 04:41.248
It's amazing.

04:41.281 --> 04:42.916
Of course
I'm seeing it.

04:42.950 --> 04:45.519
I'm -- I'm sitting next to you
in the boat.

04:45.553 --> 04:47.287
Oh!

04:47.321 --> 04:48.422
Here comes a hippo!

04:48.456 --> 04:50.223
Whoa! Take the woman!
Take my woman!

04:50.257 --> 04:52.292
There's more meat
on the man!

04:52.326 --> 04:53.694
Take him!

04:56.430 --> 04:58.399
"Being Okay
Being Alone."

04:58.432 --> 04:59.400
I read that.

04:59.433 --> 05:00.734
Want some company?

05:00.768 --> 05:04.372
Mm, chapter four says
I don't need it.

05:04.405 --> 05:07.541
This place
is fantastic.

05:07.575 --> 05:10.644
I found five books
that solve problems

05:10.678 --> 05:12.145
I didn't even know I had.

05:12.179 --> 05:13.814
Really? Only five?

05:15.182 --> 05:17.551
Hi. I see you got
the jackfruit tacos.

05:17.585 --> 05:19.186
That fills my heart
with joy.

05:19.219 --> 05:22.890
Alright, I'm gonna stop you
right now.

05:22.923 --> 05:25.192
This poor woman
doesn't want to be hit on

05:25.225 --> 05:28.195
with your weird
jackfruit pickup line.

05:28.228 --> 05:29.997
She's been through
a brutal divorce,

05:30.030 --> 05:34.568
her teenage daughter is dating
a scary, tattooed, older guy,

05:34.602 --> 05:36.404
so just back off,

05:36.437 --> 05:41.141
let her eat
whatever the hell that is,

05:41.174 --> 05:43.411
and find a book
that'll keep her from driving

05:43.444 --> 05:45.979
into the headlights
of a semi.

05:46.013 --> 05:48.115
I guess
I don't need to worry

05:48.148 --> 05:50.551
about him hitting on me now,
do I?

05:50.584 --> 05:52.420
Wait --
Wait a second.

05:52.453 --> 05:53.687
Darlene?

05:55.423 --> 05:57.190
Gale?

05:57.224 --> 05:58.726
From high school?

05:58.759 --> 06:01.495
"Pale Gale,
destined to fail"?

06:01.529 --> 06:04.698
Gale was a sad,
wounded child.

06:04.732 --> 06:06.467
And the mocking
didn't help.

06:07.501 --> 06:10.370
It's okay.
It's River now.

06:10.404 --> 06:12.239
Oh, yeah,
that's bulletproof.

06:12.272 --> 06:14.775
Well, at least
you're not as pale anymore.

06:14.808 --> 06:18.446
My eczema cream didn't allow me
to be in the sun.

06:18.479 --> 06:20.313
Not all of us
were creatures of the light,

06:20.347 --> 06:21.815
were we, "Darklene"?

06:23.417 --> 06:25.285
We went through
every grade together.

06:25.318 --> 06:27.387
I don't think we ever spoke
to each other.

06:27.421 --> 06:29.623
Mnh-mnh.
So, uh,
what are you doing here?

06:29.657 --> 06:30.958
I own the place.

06:30.991 --> 06:34.061
Indoor job. Good call.

06:34.094 --> 06:36.163
Wow. I am shocked.

06:36.196 --> 06:37.798
You didn't seem
particularly enlightened

06:37.831 --> 06:40.634
during the school's moment
of silence for Kurt Cobain.

06:40.668 --> 06:42.903
He held a bullhorn to his ass
and yelled,

06:42.936 --> 06:45.439
"I got something
that smells like teen spirit!"

06:45.473 --> 06:48.676
I-I was desperate
for attention,

06:48.709 --> 06:52.580
and if we're gonna be objective,
that got a fantastic laugh.

06:52.613 --> 06:56.083
But while in
library detention,

06:56.116 --> 06:58.151
I read a book
about the Dalai Lama,

06:58.185 --> 07:00.220
and I found a road
to happiness.

07:00.253 --> 07:02.723
Wow. Good for you.

07:02.756 --> 07:04.558
Yeah, I'd brag about
what I've been doing,

07:04.592 --> 07:06.193
but my aunt ruined that,
didn't she?

07:06.226 --> 07:08.095
Well, I left out
that you're still living in

07:08.128 --> 07:09.863
your childhood bedroom.

07:11.031 --> 07:12.900
No, no, you didn't.

07:12.933 --> 07:14.167
Ah.

07:14.201 --> 07:18.405
Maybe I can find a book
that helps me stop blurting.

07:18.438 --> 07:19.673
I'm a blurter.

07:22.009 --> 07:24.444
Well,
I am really impressed,

07:24.478 --> 07:25.879
and, uh,
it's really cool

07:25.913 --> 07:27.414
that a book turned
your life around.

07:27.447 --> 07:29.550
Maybe you could recommend
something for me.

07:29.583 --> 07:31.752
Yeah, "Time to Stop Trying
and Get Happy"

07:31.785 --> 07:33.554
is the name of a book
on Taoism.

07:33.587 --> 07:35.322
It's about
the whole Eastern thing

07:35.355 --> 07:38.158
about doing without trying.

07:38.191 --> 07:40.027
It can change your life.

07:40.060 --> 07:42.429
The author is giving
a lecture here tomorrow.

07:42.462 --> 07:44.932
Oh. Well, I'll try
to make it.

07:44.965 --> 07:46.399
As the Tao says,

07:46.433 --> 07:48.802
don't try to make it
or you won't make it.

07:48.836 --> 07:51.171
Just make it.

07:52.205 --> 07:55.308
Wait. I'm not gonna have to
take my shoes off

07:55.342 --> 07:58.946
and dance to a guy playing
a bamboo flute at me, am I?

07:58.979 --> 08:01.048
No, no, of course not.

08:01.081 --> 08:03.150

strip you naked

08:03.183 --> 08:05.185

in owl's blood.

Okay, you better
be kidding.

08:07.054 --> 08:08.589
Yeah, I better be.

08:08.622 --> 08:10.090
No, really,
you better be.

08:10.123 --> 08:12.159
Hey, I hope so, too.

he gets ya, Peter.

during the game last night.

cut off by a magical fairy.

Somebody grabbed my left wing,
so I had to get rough.

08:47.027 --> 08:48.095
You know in the cartoons,

08:48.128 --> 08:49.830
when you hit someone
with a frying pan,

08:49.863 --> 08:51.599
their face becomes
the shape of the pan?

08:52.532 --> 08:55.836
In real life, it's just teeth
and blood everywhere.

08:55.869 --> 08:57.871
Oh. God.
Was Beverly Rose here?

08:57.905 --> 08:59.707
Unfortunately,
she was.

08:59.740 --> 09:01.441
The whole point
of me working here

09:01.474 --> 09:03.577
was so
I could bring her with me.

09:03.611 --> 09:05.278
Crazy drunks
ruin everything.

09:05.312 --> 09:06.914
I mean,
I should know that.

09:06.947 --> 09:08.749
What about Emilio
watching her?

09:08.782 --> 09:11.484
I hate to ask him
for anything extra.

09:11.518 --> 09:13.721
Even though our marriage
is a sham,

09:13.754 --> 09:15.856
he's still crazy in love
with me.

09:15.889 --> 09:18.592
Must be awful to be close
to someone this hot

09:18.626 --> 09:20.460
and not be able
to have her.

09:20.493 --> 09:21.729
Well, who knows?

09:21.762 --> 09:24.698
Maybe Emilio's decided
to start going for

09:24.732 --> 09:26.734
less delusional women.

09:26.767 --> 09:28.501
You guys don't get
how hard it is

09:28.535 --> 09:30.537
having someone love you
that much.

09:30.570 --> 09:32.272
Yeah.
That's got to be tough,

09:32.305 --> 09:34.708

of spicy Latin meat

he tastes like that.

09:42.482 --> 09:44.885

there's only so long

09:44.918 --> 09:46.386
I can get away with
telling people

Look at us.

I'm gonna turn on you soon.

doesn't see

10:07.107 --> 10:09.176
that this guy Aldo
is just using her.

10:09.209 --> 10:14.147
Okay, let's finish our tea
and we'll start in a second.

10:15.148 --> 10:17.751
I really want to ask something,
but I don't like the idea

10:17.785 --> 10:20.253
of opening myself up in front
of a bunch of strangers.

10:20.287 --> 10:21.689
A stranger
is just a friend

10:21.722 --> 10:23.991
who hasn't laughed
at your stupid question yet.

10:26.259 --> 10:27.427
Uh, Joanne?

10:27.460 --> 10:28.896
Just a quick question.

10:28.929 --> 10:33.834
How can I use Taoism to become
a less negative person?

10:33.867 --> 10:36.269
I'm asking for my son.

10:36.303 --> 10:37.404
And what's your name?

10:37.437 --> 10:40.140
My name is Darlene.

10:40.173 --> 10:41.742
Very modern.

10:41.775 --> 10:44.344
Well, Darlene...

10:44.377 --> 10:47.180
negativity comes from
trying to hold onto things

10:47.214 --> 10:49.582
in a world
that is constantly changing.

10:49.616 --> 10:51.218
When you understand that,

10:51.251 --> 10:55.022
you'll let go and begin to flow
with Chi and not against it.

10:55.055 --> 10:57.057
That's just
giving into everything.

10:57.090 --> 10:59.092
For example,
if there's a 19-year-old girl

10:59.126 --> 11:01.528
that wants to date
a 38-year-old man,

11:01.561 --> 11:04.297
am I just supposed to go
with the flow with that?

11:04.331 --> 11:06.466
Did I say that how you
whispered it to me, Darlene?

11:07.434 --> 11:10.137
"Giving in"
isn't weakness.

11:10.170 --> 11:13.273
Like in kung fu,

11:13.306 --> 11:14.842
sometimes we retreat

11:14.875 --> 11:18.578
and then use the opponent's
momentum against them.

11:18.611 --> 11:21.514
We let them continue in
the direction they want to go,

11:21.548 --> 11:23.683
and that throws them
off balance.

11:23.717 --> 11:26.319
Yeah,
that's really interesting.

11:26.353 --> 11:29.089
Uh, Darlene,
did you want to ask Joanne

11:29.122 --> 11:30.623
how Tao
can help keep you

11:30.657 --> 11:32.392
from driving away
everyone you love?

11:32.425 --> 11:34.127
Nope.
Darlene's good.

11:34.161 --> 11:35.562
Not holding onto things,

11:35.595 --> 11:38.732
ready to flow on out to the car
and listen to the radio.

11:39.767 --> 11:42.369
**

11:42.402 --> 11:43.771
How's our honeymoon
going?

11:43.804 --> 11:45.238
Amazing!

11:45.272 --> 11:47.507
I'm in the Florida Keys.
Join me.

11:47.540 --> 11:49.542
Nah, I'm over it.

11:49.576 --> 11:51.444
Oh! Ooh!
This is gonna be a big one.

11:51.478 --> 11:53.847
We're gonna be eating good
tonight.

11:53.881 --> 11:55.615
Yeah, if you'd put
that thing down,

11:55.648 --> 11:57.717
get off your ass,
and take me out to dinner.

11:57.751 --> 11:59.052
You put your goggles on,

11:59.086 --> 12:01.354
I'll take you to Germany
for Oktoberfest.

12:01.388 --> 12:04.557
Oh, my God!
Oh!

12:04.591 --> 12:07.527
Look at the size
of this thing!

12:07.560 --> 12:09.863
Take a picture.

12:09.897 --> 12:11.231
Click.

12:11.264 --> 12:12.365
Got it.

12:14.802 --> 12:15.803
Hey, Emilio.

12:15.836 --> 12:17.637
I didn't know
you were still here.

12:17.670 --> 12:19.907
Took me a while
to get Beverly Rose to sleep.

12:19.940 --> 12:21.508
I was reading her
the instructions

12:21.541 --> 12:22.675
of my new convection oven.

12:22.709 --> 12:24.211
There's a real twist
at the end.

12:24.244 --> 12:25.678
You can do pizza.
[ Chuckles ]

12:25.712 --> 12:26.947
Blew her mind.

12:26.980 --> 12:28.248
[ Both chuckle ]

12:28.281 --> 12:30.750
Hey, I got to ask you
a favor.

12:30.784 --> 12:32.719
Now that The Lunch Box
is serving alcohol,

12:32.752 --> 12:35.055
we got to come up with
a new schedule to watch her.

12:35.789 --> 12:37.090
You ever heard of a joke
that starts with

12:37.124 --> 12:38.491
"A baby walks
into a bar"?

12:38.525 --> 12:40.627
No.
Well, there's a reason.

12:40.660 --> 12:43.530
Well, I can fill in
the gaps.

12:43.563 --> 12:46.133
And when I have to work,

12:46.166 --> 12:47.835
Gabriela can keep an eye
on her.

12:47.868 --> 12:48.936
She's great with kids.

12:48.969 --> 12:51.304
Gabriela?
Is that one of your cousins?

12:51.338 --> 12:53.173
She's, uh...

12:53.206 --> 12:55.442
How do you say
in English?

12:56.776 --> 12:59.913
I've been dating her exclusively
for three months.

13:00.780 --> 13:02.782
Wow.
You have a girlfriend?

13:02.816 --> 13:06.119
You and I agreed that we
should be dating other people.

13:06.153 --> 13:08.088
I didn't tell you
about Gabriela

13:08.121 --> 13:10.991
because I wanted to wait
until it was a real thing.

13:11.024 --> 13:13.994
Oh, okay.

13:14.027 --> 13:15.996
But I need to know
if she's responsible enough

13:16.029 --> 13:17.464
to watch my child.

13:17.497 --> 13:20.033
She has cousins
she babysits all the time.

13:20.067 --> 13:21.601
Okay.

13:21.634 --> 13:25.305
Uh, follow-up question --
is she pretty?

13:26.273 --> 13:27.540
Why do you care?

13:27.574 --> 13:29.242
Well, I'm a mother,

13:29.276 --> 13:31.744
and I want to keep
my baby safe,

13:31.778 --> 13:33.981
you know,
from ugly people.

13:36.416 --> 13:39.853
I am only attracted to
beautiful, smart women.

13:41.288 --> 13:43.356
Should you really be flirting
with your wife

13:43.390 --> 13:45.358
when you've got a girlfriend
at home?

13:48.929 --> 13:50.597
**

13:50.630 --> 13:52.866
So, this engaged couple's
getting inked.

13:52.900 --> 13:54.267
She's in Harris' chair

13:54.301 --> 13:56.769
getting a screaming
corpse bride on a bike,

13:56.803 --> 13:59.806
and he's in mine
getting a tattoo of Scooter,

13:59.839 --> 14:02.375
obviously the most epic
Muppet of all.

14:03.543 --> 14:06.246
And I look over
at Harris,

14:06.279 --> 14:08.615
and I get lost
in her eyes,

14:08.648 --> 14:12.619
and suddenly,
Scooter has a demon tail.

14:12.652 --> 14:15.055
[ Laughing ] What?

14:15.088 --> 14:16.456
Pretty classic meet-cute.

14:16.489 --> 14:17.724
Your eyes met,

14:17.757 --> 14:20.360
and you made a permanent mistake
on another human being.

14:20.393 --> 14:22.195
Mm-hmm.
[ Chuckles ]

14:22.229 --> 14:24.564
Oh, my God.
You got to try
these taquitos.

14:26.033 --> 14:27.901
[ Chuckles ]

14:27.935 --> 14:29.636
So good, huh?
Mm-hmm.

14:29.669 --> 14:31.204
[ Both laugh ]

14:35.408 --> 14:38.545
Anyway, um, I-I know that
I haven't seemed supportive

14:38.578 --> 14:40.047
about your relationship,

14:40.080 --> 14:42.449
but I'm getting into
Eastern philosophy,

14:42.482 --> 14:45.785
and I am trying to be more like
water and flow with things.

14:45.818 --> 14:48.055
Wait, not trying to be.

14:48.088 --> 14:50.290
I am water.

14:50.323 --> 14:51.691
I dig that.

14:51.724 --> 14:55.828
The whole Eastern thing's
super legit, and I'm into it.

14:55.862 --> 14:58.431
Aldo has a Chinese dragon tattoo
that starts on his thigh

14:58.465 --> 14:59.732
and it wraps around --
Yeah,
and it works its way

14:59.766 --> 15:02.169
all the way around
to my --
Yeah, it's okay.

15:02.202 --> 15:04.137
I don't need to know
where the dragon goes.

15:05.105 --> 15:07.074
So, what are you saying?

15:07.107 --> 15:09.276
Are you okay with us?

15:09.309 --> 15:10.543
I am.

15:10.577 --> 15:14.614
And I-I can see how much
you guys care about each other.

15:14.647 --> 15:16.849
Since the momentum
is going that way,

15:16.883 --> 15:20.153
I want you to know
that you would have my blessing

15:20.187 --> 15:21.854
if you wanted to
move in together.

15:23.923 --> 15:27.827
Well, it's kind of
a giant step.

15:27.860 --> 15:29.429
I'm ready.

15:29.462 --> 15:31.231
Are you sure?

15:31.264 --> 15:34.267
Uh, she said she's ready, Aldo.
Aren't you?

15:34.301 --> 15:36.836
I-I mean,
a commitment right now

15:36.869 --> 15:38.371
would really tell Harris

15:38.405 --> 15:41.608
that your relationship
is super legit.

15:41.641 --> 15:44.211
Well, o-okay.

15:44.244 --> 15:47.147
T-To be honest...

15:47.180 --> 15:48.248
you beat me to it.

15:48.281 --> 15:51.985
Harris, here is a key
to my place.

15:52.019 --> 15:54.021
Oh, my God!
That's so amazing!

15:54.054 --> 15:55.355
Oh, man.

15:55.388 --> 15:58.358
The boys are gonna be
so stoked.

15:58.391 --> 16:00.193
Man, they need
a role model,

16:00.227 --> 16:02.462
'cause yours truly
ain't cuttin' it.

16:02.495 --> 16:04.064
Ah.

16:04.097 --> 16:06.299
Well, what do you guys say
we all get 'faced, huh?

16:06.333 --> 16:07.400
Mm! Mm!

16:09.402 --> 16:10.403
Wow.

16:10.437 --> 16:12.539
I-I didn't think
you had it in you.

16:12.572 --> 16:14.241
Thank you so much.

16:14.274 --> 16:16.376
Are you honestly gonna move in
with that guy?

16:16.409 --> 16:18.545
You've known him for
like 10 minutes.

16:18.578 --> 16:20.613
You're gonna be at home
watching his kids,

16:20.647 --> 16:22.982
and crackhead mom's gonna
come flying through the window

16:23.016 --> 16:25.352
and latch onto your leg
like a rabid weasel.

16:25.385 --> 16:26.353
What the hell?

16:26.386 --> 16:28.088
You were the one
who said to move in.

16:28.121 --> 16:30.157
What's your problem?
I was tricking you.

16:30.190 --> 16:31.558
I just did it badly.

16:32.525 --> 16:34.027
I was hoping
that if I tried

16:34.061 --> 16:36.096
to convince you guys
to move in together,

16:36.129 --> 16:38.665
Aldo would bail, and you would
see him for who he is.

16:38.698 --> 16:40.700
I do see him
for who he really is --

16:40.733 --> 16:43.170
a great guy
who wants to be with me.

16:43.203 --> 16:44.704
And I see you
as the same

16:44.737 --> 16:47.207
controlling old goblin
you've always been.

16:47.240 --> 16:48.641
Uh, you know,
you're raising children now.

16:54.481 --> 16:54.981
Dinner's gonna be late.

16:56.116 --> 16:58.185
I was shaking it
for beads at Mardi Gras

16:58.218 --> 17:00.019
when I remembered

17:00.053 --> 17:02.389
I had food cooking.

17:02.422 --> 17:03.756
Pass.

17:03.790 --> 17:07.760
I have to go over to Emilio's
to pick up Beverly Rose anyway.

17:07.794 --> 17:09.996
How's that working out?

17:10.029 --> 17:11.698
Well,
I'm kind of freaked out

17:11.731 --> 17:13.900
about his girlfriend
watching the baby.

17:13.933 --> 17:15.001
I don't know why.

17:15.034 --> 17:17.070
I'm comfortable
leaving her here

17:17.104 --> 17:19.306
with you backwoods
squirrel-eaters.

17:19.339 --> 17:21.541
You sure that's all
that's bothering you?

17:21.574 --> 17:24.311
Well, I've never even met
this woman.

17:24.344 --> 17:26.146
All I know
is that she's pretty.

17:26.179 --> 17:28.615
Pretty, huh?

17:28.648 --> 17:29.816
How do you feel
about that?

17:29.849 --> 17:31.050
Well, I'm not jealous.

17:31.084 --> 17:32.785
I didn't want to be
with him.

17:32.819 --> 17:34.154
Right.

17:34.187 --> 17:36.589
But now maybe you're afraid
you can never be with him.

17:36.623 --> 17:38.591
He was kinda
your backup plan.

17:38.625 --> 17:41.060
No, he wasn't.
Really?

17:41.094 --> 17:44.097
You guys share Beverly Rose,
he's a great guy,

17:44.131 --> 17:47.066
he's good-looking,
and you're married.

17:48.168 --> 17:50.170
Okay,
maybe it crossed my mind

17:50.203 --> 17:52.972
that now that I'm not
having drunken one-night stands,

17:53.005 --> 17:54.907
I might be
a little pickier,

17:54.941 --> 17:57.544
and have trouble
finding the right guy.

17:57.577 --> 18:00.046
Oh, crap.
I lost my backup plan.

18:01.548 --> 18:02.715
Don't worry.

18:02.749 --> 18:05.385
You'll find
the right person.

18:05.418 --> 18:06.853
I didn't know
Louise was out there,

18:06.886 --> 18:09.122
and then
there was Louise.

18:09.156 --> 18:11.358
And here's
more good news.

18:11.391 --> 18:13.560
You don't look as old
as you are.

18:14.594 --> 18:18.365
You still got
five, seven, three years

18:18.398 --> 18:20.467
before you have to settle.

18:20.500 --> 18:23.970
I'd rather be alone
than be with someone
I don't really love.

18:24.003 --> 18:25.372
Good for you.

18:25.405 --> 18:27.840
I'm a college girl.

18:27.874 --> 18:29.075
I'm hot.

18:29.108 --> 18:30.877
And as soon as I'm sober
for a year,

18:30.910 --> 18:32.445
I can start dating again.

18:32.479 --> 18:34.113
Mm.

18:34.147 --> 18:37.750
I'd still be aggressive
with that timeframe.

18:37.784 --> 18:39.886
Love ya, baby.

18:42.155 --> 18:43.656
I want my money back.

18:43.690 --> 18:48.261
I'm feeling a lot
of negative energy right here.

18:49.196 --> 18:51.798
I did everything
the speaker said.

18:51.831 --> 18:53.966
I used the kung fu retreat
and momentum thing

18:54.000 --> 18:56.336
to trick my kid into
getting rid of her boyfriend,

18:56.369 --> 18:57.970
and now they're
living together.

18:58.004 --> 19:01.608
In Taoism, when somebody tries
to push too hard,

19:01.641 --> 19:03.343
it just leads
to frustration.

19:03.376 --> 19:04.411
Yeah, yeah.

19:04.444 --> 19:05.778
Is there anything
in this dumb store

19:05.812 --> 19:08.415
that I can use
to trick my kid?

19:08.448 --> 19:10.383
I think I have something
for you.

19:13.119 --> 19:15.054
It's the Tao Te Ching.

19:15.087 --> 19:18.325
It helped me find peace
with all my relationships.

19:18.358 --> 19:19.726
I think it could help you,
too.

19:21.594 --> 19:23.696
What about
some of these crystals?

19:23.730 --> 19:25.398
Can't I just put
a few of these in a sock

19:25.432 --> 19:28.535
and beat Aldo until he
doesn't recognize my daughter?

19:28.568 --> 19:30.002
Man,
I hope you're kidding.

19:30.036 --> 19:32.339
I hope so, too.

19:32.372 --> 19:33.906
Just use the book.

19:33.940 --> 19:35.608
Mm.

19:35.642 --> 19:37.844
I'm gonna need a bigger sock,
but okay.

19:40.647 --> 19:42.415
Whoa!

19:42.449 --> 19:46.219
I heard the women on the beaches
of Ibiza are gorgeous,

19:46.253 --> 19:50.457
but this redhead is beyond
anything I've ever seen.

19:50.490 --> 19:52.259
Oh, my God!
It's my wife!

19:52.292 --> 19:54.427
I'm the luckiest man
on Earth!

19:54.461 --> 19:57.029
I'm gonna take her
to the French Riviera.

19:58.565 --> 20:00.400
Alright.

20:00.433 --> 20:02.034
These things are starting
to freak me out.

20:02.068 --> 20:03.903
What is going on?

20:03.936 --> 20:05.272
It's nice in here.

20:05.305 --> 20:06.939
I want you to join me.

20:06.973 --> 20:08.875
In the real world,
we have a hole in the roof

20:08.908 --> 20:12.379
and I can't afford to take
my wife on a honeymoon.

20:12.412 --> 20:14.247
You deserve better.

20:14.281 --> 20:15.882
Well, of course I do.

20:15.915 --> 20:19.486
But I don't need to go
to fancy places with you.

20:19.519 --> 20:22.255
I have fun with you
wherever we go.

20:22.289 --> 20:24.624
You have fun at Costco?

20:24.657 --> 20:27.394
I especially like
when you change hats

20:27.427 --> 20:29.596
and keep going back
to the sample guy.

20:30.630 --> 20:33.199
It's a rush.

20:33.232 --> 20:35.568
Look, if we want to have
a honeymoon,

20:35.602 --> 20:38.405
all we have to do
is close our eyes

20:38.438 --> 20:40.673
and use
our imagination.

20:40.707 --> 20:43.410
Let's make love
on the beach at Aruba.

20:44.210 --> 20:46.078
I almost smell
the ocean.

20:46.112 --> 20:50.583
Oh, that's that sardine I lost
in the comforter last night.

20:50.617 --> 20:51.851
I love you.

20:57.990 --> 20:58.691
[ Crowd cheering

21:00.092 --> 21:02.194
How can I help
you fellas?

21:02.228 --> 21:03.930
Marvin:
Harris left us alone.

21:03.963 --> 21:06.065
You have to help us
build a chicken slingshot.

21:06.098 --> 21:09.268
Yes. I'll help you
hurt my chickens.

21:09.302 --> 21:11.203
But first, you boys
have to help me dig

21:11.237 --> 21:14.173
two child-sized holes
in the backyard

21:14.206 --> 21:18.311
and lay in them to make sure
I measured them correctly.

21:18.345 --> 21:19.579
Deal?

21:19.612 --> 21:24.517
