WEBVTT

00:03.711 --> 00:05.702
There she is!
Whore of whores!

00:05.736 --> 00:07.536
My Frankie could have
any woman on earth,

00:07.555 --> 00:09.339
- and he chose you?
- Ma!

00:09.373 --> 00:11.057
What are you doing here?

00:11.091 --> 00:13.209
Why can't you just be happy
that I'm happy...

00:13.227 --> 00:14.978
- With Liz?
- Can I just say one sentence?

00:15.012 --> 00:17.546
<i>Dio mio,</i> i'm an old fool.
What is wrong with me?

00:17.565 --> 00:19.015
My boy's in love!

00:20.884 --> 00:22.602
Come over for dinner.
Tonight.

00:22.653 --> 00:26.105
Do you like ox, Liz?
I'll defrost an ox for you.

00:30.995 --> 00:33.896
Look, if the situation
was reversed,

00:33.914 --> 00:35.782
you know I'd pretend
to be your boyfriend.

00:35.833 --> 00:38.234
I have a boyfriend.
In Canada.

00:38.269 --> 00:40.870
Seriously.
Chris is in Canada for the week.

00:40.904 --> 00:42.255
And I can't
be your girlfriend,

00:42.289 --> 00:44.207
'cause I'm not
an old pedophile.

00:44.241 --> 00:46.092
We prefer the term
adultophobe.

00:46.126 --> 00:48.294
Lynn, what is
going on here?

00:48.345 --> 00:50.713
Well, I'm hiding
from Sylvia.

00:50.747 --> 00:52.715
I got really good
at hiding in prison

00:52.749 --> 00:54.300
and making wine
in my toilet.

00:54.351 --> 00:56.920
Does your mom not know
you guys are together?

00:56.954 --> 00:59.355
It's been a year.
Sylvia doesn't approve of me.

00:59.390 --> 01:01.257
No one can remember why
anymore.

01:01.275 --> 01:03.309
You were his teacher,
and you seduced him.

01:03.360 --> 01:05.778
Look, here's what happened.
My mom was snooping in my room,

01:05.813 --> 01:09.399
'cause she loves me,
and she found a letter.

01:09.433 --> 01:12.485
Look what I found
in your pornography collection...

01:12.536 --> 01:13.903
A love letter.
Who sent this to you?

01:13.938 --> 01:15.121
Who is "L"?

01:15.155 --> 01:17.106
So you told her "L" was me?

01:17.141 --> 01:19.108
Liz, we just need you
to go along with this

01:19.126 --> 01:20.977
until... I don't know,
my mom dies.

01:21.011 --> 01:22.128
Or I die.

01:22.162 --> 01:24.747
No. I'm not helping
to protect <i>this.</i>

01:24.781 --> 01:27.083
- It's creepy.
- This is creepy?

01:27.117 --> 01:29.252
In prison, I was part of a fake
family with a bald woman,

01:29.286 --> 01:32.422
and our son was a basketball
with a wig on it,

01:32.456 --> 01:34.424
but... okay.
This is creepy.

01:34.458 --> 01:36.025
Frank, tell your mother
the truth,

01:36.060 --> 01:38.144
'cause living a lie
will eat you up inside.

01:38.178 --> 01:41.964
Like that parasite I got
from eating Sushi on AmTrak.

30 ROCK S01 Ep. 10 Alexis Goodlooking
and the Case of the Missing Whisky

01:58.112 --> 02:01.612
Sync and corrected by dr.jackson
for www.addic7ed.com

02:01.919 --> 02:03.619
- That's quite a suit, Kenneth.
- Thank you, sir.

02:03.654 --> 02:05.705
All my suits
are my late father's...

02:05.756 --> 02:07.490
Mr...

02:07.508 --> 02:09.324
That's weird.

02:09.342 --> 02:11.461
Kenneth, since you've left
the page program,

02:11.495 --> 02:14.297
finding you a new position here
has been

02:14.331 --> 02:16.399
one of the most difficult
challenges of my career.

02:16.433 --> 02:18.601
And I'm including
making it through the '80s

02:18.635 --> 02:20.703
without having sex
with Belinda Carlisle.

02:20.738 --> 02:22.205
I know, sir,

02:22.239 --> 02:23.940
but I just couldn't work
in ad sales.

02:23.974 --> 02:25.608
We have far too many sponsors

02:25.642 --> 02:27.527
that make housework
easier for women.

02:27.561 --> 02:30.313
That's why I'm putting you
in the standards department.

02:30.347 --> 02:33.216
You'll be responsible
for keeping the airwaves free

02:33.250 --> 02:34.901
of content that might
offend any group.

02:34.952 --> 02:36.886
It's a good starting place,
but Kenneth,

02:36.920 --> 02:38.654
if you wanna make it
in the business world,

02:38.688 --> 02:41.491
you can't be so...
Morally stubborn.

02:41.525 --> 02:43.226
There are gray areas.

02:43.260 --> 02:44.544
No, sir.

02:44.578 --> 02:46.429
There's always a right
and wrong.

02:46.463 --> 02:49.465
Before he died, my father
gave me a piece of advice.

02:49.500 --> 02:52.301
"Son, if you wanna
get ahead in this world...

02:52.336 --> 02:54.904
Oh, God, this hurts...
Tell your mother I'm gay."

02:56.740 --> 02:59.876
Nerf rifle.
<i>Mass Effect 3.</i>

02:59.910 --> 03:01.944
What else do we need
for, uh, research?

03:01.979 --> 03:03.746
Well, I need the deutsche
grammophon box set

03:03.781 --> 03:05.398
- for my opera sketch.
- An opera?

03:05.432 --> 03:06.733
Is there singing?
Because I sing.

03:06.767 --> 03:08.217
Tracy doesn't sing,
so I should do it.

03:08.252 --> 03:10.052
The audience expects it.
I'll sleep with you.

03:10.070 --> 03:12.922
No, Jenna, none of this
stuff is really for sketches.

03:12.956 --> 03:15.224
We're just saying that so we can
charge it all to the show.

03:15.242 --> 03:18.361
It's the perfect crime...
As long as Pete never finds out.

03:18.395 --> 03:19.779
Who drank this?

03:19.830 --> 03:22.248
This is the scotch I was saving
for my birthday.

03:22.282 --> 03:23.566
Someone with a key
to my office,

03:23.584 --> 03:27.203
a janitor or a security guard
or some black...

03:27.237 --> 03:30.139
Hearted individual,
probably white,

03:30.174 --> 03:33.075
has ruined
the Hornberger hang

03:33.093 --> 03:36.312
for all of us!

03:36.346 --> 03:38.214
Let's get forensics in here.

03:38.248 --> 03:39.615
Have the techs
lift a latent print,

03:39.650 --> 03:41.467
and run it against AFIS.

03:41.518 --> 03:42.885
Maybe the perp's
in the system.

03:42.920 --> 03:44.604
J-Mo,
you sound like a cop,

03:44.638 --> 03:45.788
and I should know.

03:45.823 --> 03:47.890
My Uncle was a cop...
In a porno.

03:47.925 --> 03:50.193
Tracy, every blond actress
in the business

03:50.227 --> 03:52.612
has done a pilot about
a tough but pretty lady cop

03:52.646 --> 03:53.963
with special abilities.

03:53.997 --> 03:55.648
Mine was called
<i>goodlooking.</i>

03:55.699 --> 03:57.700
I played Alexis goodlooking

03:57.734 --> 03:59.101
who was also good-looking,

03:59.119 --> 04:04.791
and my special ability was being
good at looking for clues.

04:04.825 --> 04:05.992
Let's get forensics in here.

04:06.043 --> 04:07.210
Have the techs
lift a latent print,

04:07.244 --> 04:08.311
and run it against AFIS.

04:08.345 --> 04:10.613
Maybe the perp's
in the system.

04:10.631 --> 04:12.715
Unlike my husband's killer,
who got away,

04:12.749 --> 04:14.116
and it haunts me.

04:14.134 --> 04:15.318
You know what?

04:15.352 --> 04:16.552
We should use your skills

04:16.587 --> 04:18.254
to solve the case
of Pete's missing booze.

04:18.288 --> 04:19.788
That was a long time ago,
Tracy.

04:19.807 --> 04:21.257
My detective days
are over.

04:21.291 --> 04:22.391
You sure about that?

04:22.426 --> 04:24.827
Because like all black actors,

04:24.862 --> 04:27.513
I have a lot of experience
with playing a wise black fellow

04:27.564 --> 04:30.633
who gets reluctant white people
to do things.

04:30.667 --> 04:32.635
Well...

04:32.669 --> 04:35.037
I'm just an old fool,
of course,

04:35.072 --> 04:37.607
and I don't know much about
politics or the like.

04:37.641 --> 04:40.843
But I do know
America's kinda like this here

04:40.878 --> 04:42.979
crab apple tree...

04:43.013 --> 04:44.664
John Fitzgerald Kennedy.

04:44.698 --> 04:46.782
All right, I'll do it.

04:46.817 --> 04:50.786
Let's ride, partner.

04:51.922 --> 04:53.756
I have some real problems

04:53.790 --> 04:55.324
with this
<i>Law & Order SVU</i> script.

04:55.342 --> 04:58.327
We can't say
"dick wolf" on TV.

04:58.345 --> 05:00.630
Listen up,
standards and practices.

05:00.664 --> 05:02.598
I just had an emergency
meeting with legal,

05:02.633 --> 05:04.167
and we can no longer use
the words

05:04.201 --> 05:07.370
"hit, great show, fun,"
or "broadcast television."

05:07.404 --> 05:08.804
Now, Kenneth...

05:08.838 --> 05:12.058
Mr. Donaghy, Bradley Tarkin,
junior compliance associate.

05:12.109 --> 05:14.644
We met last year at your
completely silent presentation

05:14.678 --> 05:15.745
on the power of eye contact.

05:15.779 --> 05:20.183
Yes.
I believe it was entitled...

05:20.217 --> 05:22.401
I was just an intern then,

05:22.452 --> 05:23.619
but afterwards,
I got you to sign

05:23.654 --> 05:24.787
my first edition
<i>Jack attack.</i>

05:24.821 --> 05:27.073
You know, the first edition
has a typo.

05:27.124 --> 05:29.208
When I took over microwaves,
I said to the team,

05:29.243 --> 05:30.543
"by the end of this quarter,

05:30.577 --> 05:32.528
"we're all gonna be
in the black... comma... guys."

05:32.546 --> 05:34.730
Not, "we're all gonna be
in the black guys."

05:34.765 --> 05:36.666
Anyway, nice to meet you
again, Bradley.

05:36.700 --> 05:38.501
Kenneth, a word.

05:38.535 --> 05:41.537
Balloon!

05:45.342 --> 05:46.876
Kenneth,
you are now officially

05:46.910 --> 05:48.477
in the business world.

05:48.512 --> 05:50.479
Bradley is trying
to destroy you.

05:50.514 --> 05:52.114
Destroy me?

05:52.149 --> 05:54.483
He's the best friend
I've <i>ever</i> had,

05:54.518 --> 05:56.185
tied with everyone
I've ever met.

05:56.220 --> 05:58.955
Kenneth, if you learn
one thing from me, it's this:

05:58.989 --> 06:00.590
In business,
you have no friends.

06:00.624 --> 06:02.692
Let me tell you
a little story.

06:02.726 --> 06:05.761
There was once a man named...
Henry Warren.

06:05.796 --> 06:08.097
Henry pretended
to be my friend,

06:08.131 --> 06:11.601
but he turned out to be
my very first Nemesis.

06:11.635 --> 06:13.569
We got the contract!

06:13.587 --> 06:15.238
We're gonna make
the bottles for new coke.

06:15.272 --> 06:17.039
And I'm gonna make sure
you get all the credit.

06:17.073 --> 06:18.424
Aces!

06:18.458 --> 06:20.509
Let's do some cocaine.

06:20.544 --> 06:22.712
My friendship with Henry
was a lie.

06:22.746 --> 06:25.514
We were just waiting for the
chance to destroy the other one.

06:25.549 --> 06:27.516
But Bradley gave me
my nickname.

06:27.551 --> 06:28.517
"Susan."

06:28.552 --> 06:30.019
Like "lazy Susan,"

06:30.053 --> 06:32.138
'cause I'm lazy
and effeminate.

06:32.189 --> 06:34.523
Bradley is dangerous.
Last year he was an intern.

06:34.558 --> 06:36.292
Now he's a junior
compliance associate.

06:36.326 --> 06:38.694
How did he get promoted
so quickly?

06:38.729 --> 06:41.697
I signed his book.
He had my signature.

06:41.732 --> 06:44.867
He probably put it on a forged
letter of recommendation.

06:44.901 --> 06:47.203
Sir.
That's awfully paranoid.

06:47.237 --> 06:48.771
Exactly.
"Paranoid,"

06:48.805 --> 06:50.706
from the Greek "para"
meaning "beside,"

06:50.741 --> 06:53.159
and "noid,"
which is some sort of a...

06:53.210 --> 06:55.278
Pizza demon!
No, that can't be right.

06:55.312 --> 06:57.213
The point is, you've got
to be paranoid, Kenneth.

06:57.247 --> 06:58.881
You've gotta go in there
and crush Bradley

06:58.915 --> 07:00.466
like I crushed Henry Warren.

07:00.500 --> 07:02.952
But I've never
crushed anyone

07:02.986 --> 07:04.587
except accused witches.

07:04.621 --> 07:07.456
Get in there!

07:11.845 --> 07:14.597
- Be cool, be cool, be cool.
- How did you get in here?

07:14.631 --> 07:16.599
Frank said
you couldn't come to dinner

07:16.633 --> 07:18.067
because you weren't
feeling well.

07:18.101 --> 07:19.635
But I know the best
thing for a fever

07:19.670 --> 07:22.605
is food, wine,
and cheek pinching!

07:22.639 --> 07:24.156
So I packed everything up,

07:24.191 --> 07:26.075
prayed to the patron
Saint of locked apartments,

07:26.109 --> 07:28.611
- and here we are.
- No. Absolutely n...

07:28.645 --> 07:30.830
You don't have a say in this!
Now, lie down.

07:30.864 --> 07:32.682
While I'm here,
you do nothing.

07:32.716 --> 07:34.150
As we say in Italy...

07:39.790 --> 07:41.791
Eat an arancine.

07:48.092 --> 07:49.893
I love our little family.

07:52.748 --> 07:53.868
Pete?

07:54.234 --> 07:55.902
Yeah, I saw him
earlier today.

07:55.936 --> 07:57.203
Why?
Something wrong?

07:57.237 --> 07:58.571
Someone drank his scotch.

07:58.605 --> 08:00.006
You wouldn't know anything
about that, would you?

08:00.040 --> 08:01.174
Why would I?

08:01.208 --> 08:03.643
I was gonna drink it with him
on his birthday.

08:03.677 --> 08:05.578
Okay, but if you think
of anything,

08:05.612 --> 08:07.847
use this phone
as a reminder to call us.

08:07.881 --> 08:09.415
I may not pick up,

08:09.449 --> 08:11.217
'cause I lost my phone
just now.

08:11.251 --> 08:13.352
If you think of anything,

08:13.370 --> 08:15.354
call us.

08:15.372 --> 08:17.523
Hang on.
This chair's been moved.

08:20.911 --> 08:22.695
Read him his rights.

08:22.713 --> 08:24.881
I should tell my husband
I'm gonna be late tonight.

08:24.915 --> 08:28.434
No, wait, I can't.
He's dead.

08:30.437 --> 08:32.538
Hang on.

08:32.573 --> 08:34.974
The trash was moved.

08:37.811 --> 08:39.428
Hiding something,
Mr. Lutz?

08:39.462 --> 08:42.849
Okay. I drank it.
We all drank it.

08:42.883 --> 08:45.318
We wanted booze, but we didn't
wanna hang out with Pete.

08:45.352 --> 08:46.719
It's the worst!

08:46.753 --> 08:48.254
He always brings out
his guitar and sings.

08:48.288 --> 08:50.606
He's got one story,
and it's about him

08:50.657 --> 08:52.758
seeing Phil Donahue
at a mall.

08:52.793 --> 08:55.778
Now comes the worst part.

08:55.829 --> 08:57.830
The paperwork.

09:02.135 --> 09:03.302
What's wrong, Susan?

09:03.337 --> 09:05.905
Mr. Pfister
just took me to the woodshed,

09:05.939 --> 09:08.090
which I didn't even realize
could be a metaphor.

09:08.125 --> 09:10.543
I guess I signed off
on a script

09:10.577 --> 09:13.946
where an Asian character
refers to "Rindsay Rohan"

09:13.981 --> 09:15.932
posing for <i>"Prayboy."</i>

09:15.966 --> 09:18.885
But I know
that's very offensive.

09:18.919 --> 09:20.887
Especially because asians
are under-represented

09:20.921 --> 09:22.388
- on this network.
- Exactly.

09:22.422 --> 09:23.389
If there are more
actors of Asian descent...

09:23.423 --> 09:24.857
Shut up!
Just shut up, Roy!

09:24.892 --> 09:26.442
- I am talking to Kenneth.
- I'm dealing with something!

09:26.476 --> 09:29.228
No one wants
to hear from you.

09:29.262 --> 09:30.646
I don't even remember
reading that script.

09:30.697 --> 09:33.816
It's... your signature
on the memo.

09:33.867 --> 09:35.768
That does look like my "X."

09:35.786 --> 09:37.153
Susan, as a friend,

09:37.204 --> 09:39.989
quit before they fire you.

09:41.508 --> 09:43.709
Your meatballs are <i>good!</i>

09:43.744 --> 09:45.411
Like Ikea good!

09:45.445 --> 09:47.496
Is there parmesan in this?

09:47.547 --> 09:49.749
And Lemon.
And a little fennel?

09:49.783 --> 09:51.751
Are you sure you're not
Italian, Liz?

09:51.785 --> 09:53.285
Maybe from the North?

09:53.303 --> 09:55.788
That's where the vampires
used to live.

09:55.822 --> 09:57.924
What's the matter, Frank?
You're so quiet!

09:57.958 --> 10:01.177
You're sitting at dinner
next to a beautiful older woman.

10:01.228 --> 10:03.679
Eat something and kiss her!

10:08.969 --> 10:10.853
No! I can't do this.

10:10.904 --> 10:13.873
Ma, Liz isn't the "L"
in that letter.

10:13.907 --> 10:17.810
It's...
Lynn Onkman.

10:17.844 --> 10:20.546
Elizabeth,
I'm gonna ask you to leave.

10:20.580 --> 10:22.615
But this is my...

10:23.917 --> 10:26.185
I don't think Bradley's
my friend.

10:26.219 --> 10:28.721
I hate to say, "told ya,"
because it reminds me

10:28.755 --> 10:30.790
of my one-night stand
with Nikki finke.

10:30.824 --> 10:32.992
He's trying to get me fired.
What do I do?

10:33.026 --> 10:34.694
Pray for a body switch
mix-up

10:34.728 --> 10:37.296
so we can see the world
from each other's perspectives?

10:37.330 --> 10:39.498
No. You destroy him.

10:39.516 --> 10:40.716
With this.

10:40.767 --> 10:43.052
I did some research.

10:43.103 --> 10:45.705
And unlike what he wrote
on his application,

10:45.739 --> 10:48.641
Bradley never graduated
from Syracuse.

10:48.675 --> 10:51.344
He's four credits shy
of a degree in bro studies.

10:51.378 --> 10:54.213
You slip this transcript
under your manager's door,

10:54.247 --> 10:55.381
and he's fired.

10:55.415 --> 10:57.083
No! I can't do that.

10:57.117 --> 10:58.584
It's wrong!

10:58.618 --> 11:00.219
If you don't get him,
he gets you.

11:00.253 --> 11:01.587
And that little snake

11:01.621 --> 11:03.072
keeps slithering up
the corporate ladder

11:03.123 --> 11:04.557
instead of a good man
like yourself.

11:04.591 --> 11:07.259
Kenneth, sometimes you've gotta
get your hands dirty

11:07.294 --> 11:09.045
for the good of company...

11:09.079 --> 11:10.696
And country.

11:10.731 --> 11:13.866
My two favorite
kinds of music.

11:16.136 --> 11:18.504
Hey, everybody's just
sitting around in there

11:18.538 --> 11:20.473
waiting for you two
to shoot promos.

11:20.507 --> 11:22.708
Thank God I've got my awesome
Phil Donahue story.

11:22.743 --> 11:25.111
Pete, there's been a
development in the whiskey case.

11:25.145 --> 11:26.679
What? No!
Forget the whiskey!

11:26.713 --> 11:29.148
Look, all I wanted to do
was hang with my friends,

11:29.182 --> 11:30.433
rock some jams,

11:30.484 --> 11:32.618
and tell the story about
my cousin seeing Phil Donahue.

11:32.652 --> 11:34.787
I mean me!
I-I'm the one who saw him.

11:34.821 --> 11:37.189
We just wanted
to tell you...

11:37.224 --> 11:39.558
We don't know what happened
to your whiskey.

11:42.496 --> 11:43.946
What was that?

11:43.997 --> 11:46.082
He doesn't need to know
how it went down.

11:46.116 --> 11:47.399
It would hurt him too much.

11:47.417 --> 11:49.635
I broke the number one rule
of being on the force.

11:49.669 --> 11:50.970
Don't fall in love
with your car?

11:51.004 --> 11:53.072
No.
I let it get personal.

11:53.106 --> 11:54.290
You're right.

11:54.341 --> 11:55.741
The car thing is stupid.

11:55.776 --> 11:57.843
The thing is,
the writers got away with it.

11:57.878 --> 12:00.245
So what are we gonna do
about it?

12:00.263 --> 12:02.314
We're goin' rogue.

12:02.349 --> 12:04.283
Hey.

12:04.317 --> 12:05.918
Sorry about last night.

12:05.936 --> 12:07.103
Yeah.
I had to sleep here.

12:07.137 --> 12:08.521
You know,
they turned the heat off.

12:08.555 --> 12:10.523
If I hadn't found
that other blanket, I'd...

12:10.557 --> 12:12.274
Wait, where'd it go?

12:12.309 --> 12:14.026
Oh, God.
It was mice!

12:14.061 --> 12:16.695
The blanket was mice!

12:16.730 --> 12:18.948
So... what happened
with Sylvia?

12:18.982 --> 12:20.116
You were right, Liz.

12:20.150 --> 12:21.867
Lying to my mom
was stressing me out.

12:21.902 --> 12:24.070
I mean, I haven't
gained weight in months.

12:24.104 --> 12:25.204
It wasn't worth it.

12:25.238 --> 12:27.006
So what,
you broke up with Lynn?

12:27.040 --> 12:28.958
- Just promise me...
- Here.

12:28.992 --> 12:31.443
That you'll take care of
yourself.

12:31.461 --> 12:33.496
Don't let Liz work you
too hard.

12:33.547 --> 12:35.447
I do really hate her.

12:35.465 --> 12:37.216
I think
she's a terrible person.

12:37.250 --> 12:39.168
First of all,
why were you in my bedroom,

12:39.219 --> 12:41.504
and why would you tell me
that part of the conversation?

12:41.555 --> 12:43.622
It's the only part where we
weren't having break-up sex.

12:43.657 --> 12:45.691
- Come on!
- Look, I'm sorry.

12:45.725 --> 12:48.494
And I appreciate
everything you did, so...

12:48.528 --> 12:49.812
I made you some meatballs.

12:49.846 --> 12:51.197
It's my mom's recipe.

12:51.231 --> 12:53.032
- So you're sure you're okay?
- Yeah.

12:53.066 --> 12:54.967
Definitely.
With all this behind me,

12:54.985 --> 12:57.353
I'm... happy.
Thanks.

12:57.404 --> 12:58.687
Eat them now!

12:58.738 --> 13:00.840
Quiet.
I do the talking.

13:05.178 --> 13:06.529
Henry.

13:06.580 --> 13:07.980
Henry Warren?

13:07.998 --> 13:09.665
Henry Warren-Chang.

13:09.699 --> 13:12.585
I married a very bossy
Chinese lady.

13:12.619 --> 13:14.753
What on earth
are you doing here?

13:14.788 --> 13:16.872
- Please, sit down.
- Thank you.

13:16.923 --> 13:20.325
I haven't seen you since
the 1985 G.E. talent show

13:20.343 --> 13:22.378
when I convinced you
to sing <i>Monster mash,</i>

13:22.429 --> 13:23.829
knowing full well
that Jack Welch

13:23.847 --> 13:25.881
is terrified of monsters,
and I ended your career.

13:25.932 --> 13:27.433
Not "ended."

13:27.467 --> 13:29.051
Doing quite well, actually.

13:29.102 --> 13:32.054
In publishing now.
Encyclopedias.

13:32.105 --> 13:34.340
I wanted to stop by
because a young man

13:34.374 --> 13:37.776
named Kenneth parcell came
to my office this afternoon.

13:37.811 --> 13:39.778
He did?
What did he want?

13:39.813 --> 13:41.814
He wanted to find out
if my life turned out okay

13:41.848 --> 13:43.382
after you took me down.

13:43.416 --> 13:45.350
Because he's afraid he might
have to do the same thing

13:45.368 --> 13:46.619
to someone else.

13:46.653 --> 13:48.954
- And what did you tell him?
- I told him the truth.

13:48.989 --> 13:50.289
I'm great.

13:50.323 --> 13:52.458
I lease a certified
pre-owned lexus,

13:52.492 --> 13:54.059
both my sons are magicians,

13:54.094 --> 13:55.427
and for my birthday,

13:55.462 --> 13:57.796
wei-lin got me tickets
to the Broadway show <i>Memphis.</i>

13:57.831 --> 14:00.699
So......

14:00.734 --> 14:03.135
And I see that you've done
very well for yourself.

14:03.170 --> 14:06.639
Well, that sofa
is made from sea biscuit.

14:09.276 --> 14:11.760
Well...
We're both very impressive.

14:11.811 --> 14:13.562
But at what cost, Jack?

14:13.597 --> 14:15.514
The first couple months
that we worked together,

14:15.548 --> 14:16.765
we were good friends,

14:16.816 --> 14:18.651
and then we turned against
each other and...

14:18.685 --> 14:20.402
Come on, Henry.
We were never friends.

14:20.437 --> 14:23.405
We were pretending so we could
learn each other's weaknesses

14:23.440 --> 14:25.157
and then...
Exploit them.

14:25.192 --> 14:26.725
But what about
all the dinners?

14:26.743 --> 14:28.911
I mean, we talked for hours.

14:28.945 --> 14:31.263
- I was gathering information.
- All right.

14:31.298 --> 14:32.915
What about the drive
up to pittsfield

14:32.949 --> 14:34.300
when we stopped
at sturbridge village?

14:34.334 --> 14:35.668
Remember?
We had fun.

14:35.702 --> 14:37.419
We saw a candle being made.

14:37.454 --> 14:40.406
I didn't really care
about that candle, Henry.

14:40.440 --> 14:42.141
I don't even remember
what color it was.

14:42.175 --> 14:45.628
Regular white-tan
candle color, Jack!

14:45.679 --> 14:47.346
You know what?

14:47.380 --> 14:49.348
I really feel sorry
for Kenneth parcell,

14:49.382 --> 14:50.983
because you're gonna beat
all that's good out of him

14:51.017 --> 14:54.253
and turn him into another
paranoid corporate killer.

14:56.356 --> 14:58.123
I remember our trip
to Hilton head.

14:58.158 --> 15:01.026
That wasn't me!

15:03.743 --> 15:06.543
Take a sit 'cause no one
is going anywhere!

15:09.733 --> 15:11.517
We know you all drank
Pete's scotch...

15:11.568 --> 15:12.985
So here's how
we're gonna play it.

15:13.019 --> 15:15.688
You're gonna hang out with Pete
every night this week.

15:15.739 --> 15:17.156
Why would we do that?

15:17.190 --> 15:19.024
'Cause we have you dead
to rights, you black bastard!

15:19.075 --> 15:20.075
And if you don't play along,

15:20.110 --> 15:21.577
we tell Pete
about your little scam...

15:21.611 --> 15:23.913
How the show's been paying
for your video games

15:23.947 --> 15:25.831
and nerf rifles
and pornography.

15:25.866 --> 15:27.316
That's right!

15:27.350 --> 15:29.652
We know you ordered
a porn version of <i>Temple Grandin</i>

15:29.686 --> 15:32.154
entitled
<i>ten poles rammed in.</i>

15:32.172 --> 15:34.356
You ought to be
ashamed of yourselves.

15:34.391 --> 15:35.991
Let's get outta here,
Maroney.

15:36.009 --> 15:39.128
The sight of these people
plus the crayons I ate earlier

15:39.162 --> 15:42.264
make me sick.

15:44.434 --> 15:47.386
<i>Sing us a song,
you're the guitar man</i>

15:47.437 --> 15:50.005
<i>and this is
Pete's birthday night</i>

15:50.023 --> 15:52.057
Any mysteries
that need solving, Liz?

15:52.108 --> 15:53.876
- Actually, yes.
- What happened?

15:53.910 --> 15:55.694
Who attacked you
and gave you that haircut?

15:55.729 --> 15:58.614
No, it's these meatballs.
They don't taste right.

15:58.648 --> 16:00.115
There's an extra ingredient.

16:00.150 --> 16:02.401
It's something familiar.

16:04.955 --> 16:08.324
<i>P.S. I love you</i>
<i>is so sad.</i>

16:08.358 --> 16:10.759
No one should have to be married

16:10.794 --> 16:12.127
to Gerard Butler.

16:12.162 --> 16:16.065
Or hilary swank!

16:18.969 --> 16:21.170
It's tears!

16:21.204 --> 16:22.972
Frank was crying
when he made these.

16:23.006 --> 16:25.424
He lied!
He's miserable.

16:25.475 --> 16:28.477
But I don't understand.
He seemed so happy earlier.

16:28.511 --> 16:29.562
Forget it, Tracy.

16:29.596 --> 16:31.981
It's midtown.

16:37.821 --> 16:39.221
Kenneth, don't do it.

16:39.239 --> 16:43.108
You can't destroy Bradley,
you... innocent goon.

16:43.143 --> 16:45.427
You're the most remarkable
person I know,

16:45.462 --> 16:46.896
and I've met
jaleel White.

16:46.930 --> 16:48.497
Incredibly charismatic.

16:48.531 --> 16:50.599
He makes Stefan urquelle
look like Steve urkel.

16:50.634 --> 16:53.102
- But my career.
- Forget about your career.

16:53.136 --> 16:55.371
I'd rather see you get fired
and lease a car

16:55.405 --> 16:57.973
than watch you turn into
someone like me.

16:58.008 --> 16:59.408
Now, give me
that transcript.

16:59.442 --> 17:01.577
So you're trying
to help me.

17:01.611 --> 17:03.746
Of course I am, Kenneth.
I'm your friend.

17:03.780 --> 17:06.515
It's just... the other day
you said in business

17:06.549 --> 17:08.217
I have no friends,

17:08.251 --> 17:10.319
and you were right
about Bradley,

17:10.353 --> 17:12.354
so what does that
say about you?

17:12.388 --> 17:15.290
Maybe you're afraid
I <i>will</i> become you.

17:15.325 --> 17:17.726
I'll climb
that corporate ladder

17:17.761 --> 17:19.895
until I eventually
take your job.

17:19.930 --> 17:21.497
And then where will you be?

17:21.531 --> 17:22.998
Out on your ass

17:23.032 --> 17:25.233
like stone Mountain's mailman

17:25.268 --> 17:27.769
riding his trusty donkey
erasmus.

17:27.787 --> 17:31.440
That is some
high-level paranoid thinking.

17:31.474 --> 17:34.677
Like Hitler...
Or Willy wonka.

17:34.711 --> 17:36.795
If you're thinking that way,

17:36.830 --> 17:40.983
then I'm... already too late.

17:57.317 --> 17:59.001
Why are you keeping me late
to write the cold open?

17:59.035 --> 18:01.737
- Well, you know politics.
- I don't know anything.

18:01.771 --> 18:04.239
I get all my news from the radio
in <i>Grand Theft Auto.</i>

18:04.274 --> 18:05.691
Frankie! Are you okay?

18:05.742 --> 18:07.976
<i>La Donna di scoregge</i>
<i>called and said you were sick,</i>

18:07.994 --> 18:09.545
so I came by to make you
chicken soup.

18:09.579 --> 18:12.031
- Where can I kill this?
- Wait... Liz called you?

18:12.082 --> 18:14.416
- No. She called me.
- You!

18:14.451 --> 18:17.703
How dare you?
Get out of my Liz's office.

18:17.754 --> 18:19.521
You said Frank
wanted to get back together.

18:19.556 --> 18:21.991
Why would you tell her that?
I said I was happy.

18:22.025 --> 18:24.659
You lied... you're miserable.
You cried in my food!

18:24.678 --> 18:27.496
Sylvia,
your son is not sick.

18:27.530 --> 18:29.465
And Lynn,
Frank didn't actually say

18:29.499 --> 18:30.933
that he wanted
to get back together.

18:30.967 --> 18:33.669
So I wore my sexy underwear
for nothing?

18:33.703 --> 18:34.870
I'll kill you!

18:34.904 --> 18:37.439
Ma'am, I am in
a Mexican prison gang.

18:37.474 --> 18:40.142
You kill me, Los Tiberones
will green-light a 1-8-7 on you,

18:40.176 --> 18:41.343
and you don't want
that kind of heat.

18:41.378 --> 18:43.062
Sylvia,
your son is not happy.

18:43.113 --> 18:44.913
And not that you care,
but neither is Lynn.

18:44.948 --> 18:46.398
That's true.
When Liz called me,

18:46.449 --> 18:48.517
I was getting this tattoo.

18:48.551 --> 18:50.586
I'm not creative.

18:50.620 --> 18:52.388
And believe me, I get it.
This shouldn't work.

18:52.422 --> 18:54.289
I mean, how they met
is disgusting.

18:54.324 --> 18:56.091
Their age difference
is just weird.

18:56.126 --> 18:58.027
They shouldn't go together.

18:58.061 --> 18:59.428
But you know what else
shouldn't go together?

18:59.462 --> 19:04.199
Veal, fennel, lemon,
cheese, and pork.

19:04.217 --> 19:06.568
That's right.
Your meatballs.

19:06.603 --> 19:08.604
Lynn and Frank...

19:08.638 --> 19:13.375
Are just as good
as your meatballs.

19:13.410 --> 19:16.061
That's it?
We're meatballs?

19:16.096 --> 19:17.813
That's the stupidest thing
I've ever heard.

19:17.847 --> 19:19.581
Do you have any idea

19:19.616 --> 19:21.550
what I've been through
for love?

19:21.584 --> 19:23.318
Public humiliation.

19:23.353 --> 19:26.955
Johnny Carson in his monologue
said I was looking at 20 years,

19:26.990 --> 19:29.825
but I'd probably
be more attracted to 12.

19:29.859 --> 19:32.444
I mean, that's an okay joke,
but it hurt.

19:32.495 --> 19:35.114
And then prison,
where we only had one movie

19:35.165 --> 19:38.000
with dabney Coleman
and the kid from <i>E. T.?</i>

19:38.034 --> 19:39.968
<i>- Cloak & Dagger?</i>
- Shut up, Liz.

19:40.003 --> 19:42.454
I lost my house, my life,

19:42.505 --> 19:44.506
but it has all been worth it.

19:44.541 --> 19:47.342
I mean, even if I never see
Frank again, it was worth it.

19:47.377 --> 19:50.646
And you call us meatballs!

19:50.680 --> 19:51.947
Elizabeth,

19:51.981 --> 19:55.017
I'm gonna ask you to leave.

19:57.120 --> 19:58.854
Okay, but if you look
at my Internet history,

19:58.888 --> 20:02.791
I'm researching a movie about
two male centaurs kissing.

20:04.310 --> 20:06.812
I was wrong.

20:06.863 --> 20:09.164
This isn't creepy because
you're dating your teacher.

20:09.199 --> 20:11.200
This is creepy because
you're dating your mother.

20:11.234 --> 20:13.102
You found someone
just like me

20:13.136 --> 20:15.838
because I'm the woman
you really wanna be with!

20:15.872 --> 20:17.473
'Cause you're the best!

20:17.507 --> 20:20.476
Frankie, you're the best.

20:22.962 --> 20:25.514
My big family.

20:25.548 --> 20:29.784
<i>And Phil Donahue's
walking past cinnabon</i>

20:29.803 --> 20:33.121
<i>and he's making
eye contact with me</i>

20:33.139 --> 20:36.592
<i>I can tell by his smile
that he'll stay for a while</i>

20:36.626 --> 20:39.194
<i>and say, "Pete,
you're who I wanna be"</i>

20:39.271 --> 20:41.671
Sync and corrected by dr.jackson
for www.addic7ed.com

20:41.702 --> 20:43.136
Well, maybe I never did
go to college

20:43.170 --> 20:44.737
or travel around the world.

20:44.772 --> 20:46.339
So I don't know much
about worldly things

20:46.373 --> 20:49.375
like taco meat
and having all your fingers.

20:50.023 --> 20:52.190
Lord knows some of my friends
are just shrubs

20:52.208 --> 20:54.860
I put hats on
and get high with.

20:54.894 --> 20:57.896
My wife had two
of the president's babies,

20:57.930 --> 20:59.398
and you're one of 'em.

20:59.432 --> 21:01.133
I can tell you one thing...

21:01.167 --> 21:03.702
I'm gonna kill all y'all
in y'all sleep.

21:03.736 --> 21:07.072
Now, I don't know nothing about
no literature or history,

21:07.106 --> 21:09.057
but I'll tell you
what I do know.

21:09.092 --> 21:11.977
This movie was written
by white nerds.

21:12.011 --> 21:13.011
Cut!
