WEBVTT

00:08.182 --> 00:10.314
Welcome to
the south pole, son--

00:10.401 --> 00:12.490
where all directions face north.

00:14.275 --> 00:15.493
I wonder if that's why
penguins are always

00:15.580 --> 00:16.799
walking in circles...

00:16.886 --> 00:19.541
their GPS devices
are going nuts.

00:19.628 --> 00:21.847
This is amazing, Dad.

00:21.934 --> 00:25.286
- - Look at all that snow.

00:25.373 --> 00:26.896
Remember that time Liam
tricked Dash

00:26.983 --> 00:28.593
into thinking that
yellow snow meant

00:28.680 --> 00:30.552
that there was
gold buried underneath?

00:30.639 --> 00:32.771
Yeah, and he started digging
like crazy with his bare hands.

00:32.858 --> 00:34.077
His bare hands, yeah.

00:34.164 --> 00:35.644
Yeah, now that was amazing.

00:35.731 --> 00:37.167
Yeah.

00:37.254 --> 00:38.647
Everything about you boys is.

00:40.475 --> 00:43.130
Hey, look.
I think that's Elephant Island,

00:43.217 --> 00:44.740
where Ernest Shackleton led

00:44.827 --> 00:47.917
his Antarctic expedition
in 1914.

00:48.004 --> 00:49.788
I'm reading about it
in The Dangerous Book.

00:49.875 --> 00:52.095
You're still reading the book.

00:52.182 --> 00:53.618
Makes me happy.

00:53.705 --> 00:55.055
It makes me happy too.

00:57.666 --> 00:59.233
Whoa.

00:59.320 --> 01:02.279
How did a walrus get onboard?

01:02.366 --> 01:05.630
Ooh! Uh, that's no walrus, son.
That's Ernest's wife,

01:05.717 --> 01:07.458
the Lady Shackleton. Be nice.

01:07.545 --> 01:10.331
Yes, unfortunately,
we didn't have orthodontists

01:10.418 --> 01:12.333
back at the turn of the century.

01:12.420 --> 01:17.381
Sorry, Mom--I mean,
Lady Shackleton.

01:17.468 --> 01:19.905
Boy, she really needs
some serious headgear.

01:23.387 --> 01:25.346
I wish her aim was
as bad as her teeth.

01:32.657 --> 01:35.530
Uh, Wyatt

01:35.617 --> 01:38.010
And who the heck
is Lady Shackleton?

01:38.098 --> 01:41.101
Uh...sorry, Mr. Tree.

01:41.188 --> 01:43.538
Just someone I confused
for a walrus.

01:45.000 --> 01:51.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:26.058 --> 02:27.408
Thanks for coming in,
Mrs. McKenna.

02:27.495 --> 02:29.453
Of course.
All...I'm just surprised

02:29.540 --> 02:31.020
that, this time, it's for Wyatt.
You know,

02:31.107 --> 02:32.978
he's never been
the problem before.

02:33.065 --> 02:35.720
Yes, we have had a fair number
of tête-à-têtes

02:35.807 --> 02:38.636
regarding Dash's behavior...

02:38.723 --> 02:42.858
and Liam was never shy about
speaking his mind in class.

02:43.685 --> 02:45.077
But...

02:45.165 --> 02:46.818
this is a first for Wyatt.

02:47.993 --> 02:49.386
He's a wonderful boy,

02:49.473 --> 02:51.258
but we've just been noticing
some odd behavior

02:51.345 --> 02:53.521
ever since
your husband's passing.

02:53.608 --> 02:55.479
My condolences again,
by the way.

02:55.566 --> 02:57.220
Thank you.

02:57.307 --> 02:59.048
Yeah, Wyatt's...
he's been

02:59.135 --> 03:01.224
in the clouds a little
recently.

03:01.311 --> 03:03.139
You know, I guess we all have.

03:03.226 --> 03:06.577
This might just be his way
of coping with the loss.

03:06.664 --> 03:08.840
Our school counselor thought
it might be a good idea

03:08.927 --> 03:10.538
for him to actually speak
with a therapist.

03:13.062 --> 03:14.672
Yeah, of-of course.

03:14.759 --> 03:16.239
You know, whatever he needs.

03:17.545 --> 03:19.242
Do you think I should have
his brothers see someone also?

03:19.329 --> 03:20.722
Let's start
with the easy one.

03:20.809 --> 03:22.332
Yeah, okay.

03:22.419 --> 03:23.855
I'm just gonna
have to figure out

03:23.942 --> 03:25.814
how I'm gonna pay for it.
Um, money's been

03:25.901 --> 03:27.424
- a little tight recently.
- Oh, I can suggest

03:27.511 --> 03:29.034
a clinic.
Um, I went there

03:29.121 --> 03:30.558
to quit smoking.

03:30.645 --> 03:32.168
It was the only place
I could afford

03:32.255 --> 03:33.604
on a public school salary.
I am down to

03:33.691 --> 03:35.127
two packs of nicotine gum

03:35.215 --> 03:37.478
and three shoulder patches
a day.

03:37.565 --> 03:39.741
So clearly, they know
what they're doing.

03:39.828 --> 03:41.133
Sure.

03:41.221 --> 03:42.613
Hey, well, thank you,
Mr. Dunnan.

03:42.700 --> 03:44.833
Um...and don't take this
the wrong way,

03:44.920 --> 03:48.053
but I hope not to be back
in this chair any time soon.

03:48.140 --> 03:50.099
Mr. Dunnan,
Dash McKenna was sent

03:50.186 --> 03:51.579
to us again.

03:51.666 --> 03:53.189
It's not my fault!

03:53.276 --> 03:55.147
Ask the lunch lady
when she wakes up.

03:56.366 --> 03:57.541
Back in the chair.

04:00.544 --> 04:02.416
Ah!

04:02.503 --> 04:04.418
The Page of Pentacles.

04:04.505 --> 04:06.550
There may be a positive
financial venture

04:06.637 --> 04:08.248
- in your future.
- Perfect.

04:08.335 --> 04:10.206
Uh, now, uh...
do the cards say anything

04:10.293 --> 04:12.991
specifically about Lucky Louie
in the seventh at Ascot Park?

04:13.078 --> 04:15.298
Terry, you know
they don't work that way.

04:15.385 --> 04:16.778
What kind of odds
are you getting?

04:16.865 --> 04:18.345
Well, he's-- Did I take

04:18.432 --> 04:20.172
a wrong turn and end up
in the dark ages?

04:20.260 --> 04:21.957
Tarot cards

04:22.043 --> 04:25.482
Be careful, Liam.
You don't wanna tempt the fates.

04:25.569 --> 04:27.702
"The fates."
It's all mumbo-jumbo.

04:27.789 --> 04:29.834
the Constitution,

04:29.921 --> 04:32.054
trickle-down economics,
and the sugary deliciousness

04:32.141 --> 04:33.577
of Crunch Berry cereal.

04:33.664 --> 04:35.231
- It is delicious.
- We're living

04:35.318 --> 04:36.798
in an age of science, people.

04:36.885 --> 04:39.540
These cards are quackery,
pure and simple.

04:39.627 --> 04:42.543
I wouldn't be so sure.
The powers of the Universe

04:42.630 --> 04:46.329
existed long before
your precious science.

04:46.416 --> 04:48.113
Well, you can keep
living in the dark,

04:48.200 --> 04:51.726
but I don't have to,
'cause I can turn on a light.

04:51.813 --> 04:53.815
Invented by a scientist.

04:53.902 --> 04:56.165
Who was inspired
by the Universe.

04:56.252 --> 04:58.950
That was mapped by a scientist.

04:59.037 --> 05:00.517
Maybe in this dimension.

05:00.604 --> 05:03.738
Whoa...mind blown.
That...

05:03.825 --> 05:05.566
You know what?
Maybe you're right.

05:05.653 --> 05:06.871
Let's see what
your kooky cards say.

05:06.958 --> 05:09.831
Abracadabra and hocus-pocus.

05:12.312 --> 05:15.140
Uh-oh.
The five swords.

05:15.227 --> 05:18.143
I think the Universe might
have put a hex on you.

05:18.230 --> 05:20.015
A hex.
Yeah, right.

05:20.102 --> 05:21.364
Okay, careful, Liam.

05:21.451 --> 05:22.844
Soccer star David Beckham

05:22.931 --> 05:25.150
once said the same thing
to a voodoo priestess.

05:25.237 --> 05:26.891
She put a foot-shrinking spell
on him.

05:26.978 --> 05:28.502
Now he buys all his shoes
at Baby Gap.

05:28.589 --> 05:29.764
Career over.

05:29.851 --> 05:31.505
I'm not sure
that's entirely factual,

05:31.592 --> 05:35.378
but the point is
to not tempt the Universe.

05:35.465 --> 05:38.207
Consider it tempted.
You hear that, universe?

05:38.294 --> 05:42.211
Come and get me.
I welcome your he--

05:44.996 --> 05:45.867
Liam?

05:49.958 --> 05:52.308
Psych.
I told you,

05:52.395 --> 05:54.571
there's no such thing
as a hex.

05:57.182 --> 05:58.575
I would've done that anyway.

06:02.274 --> 06:03.972
This stupid dishwasher.

06:04.059 --> 06:07.628
Everything comes out
dirtier than when it went in.

06:07.715 --> 06:09.325
Ah! I'll grab those.

06:12.372 --> 06:13.982
You washed your shoes
in the dishwasher?

06:14.069 --> 06:15.418
- Mm-hmm.
- It's a dishwasher.

06:15.505 --> 06:16.985
Terry, it's right in the name.

06:17.072 --> 06:18.639
I only put 'em in
so it'd be a full load.

06:18.726 --> 06:20.162
Always thinking responsibly.

06:20.249 --> 06:21.381
And for the record,
these aren't shoes.

06:21.468 --> 06:22.686
They are Crocs.

06:22.773 --> 06:25.036
Okay, well, when
the dishwasher breaks

06:25.123 --> 06:27.517
and we need to get a new one,
who's gonna pay for it?

06:27.604 --> 06:28.953
Because I sure can't.

06:42.053 --> 06:43.446
Are you okay, Beth?

06:45.056 --> 06:46.580
Oh.

06:46.667 --> 06:48.364
It's just...

06:48.451 --> 06:51.236
It's just little things
like this, you know?

06:51.323 --> 06:53.587
Like, I feel like--sometimes
I feel like I'm doing okay,

06:53.674 --> 06:55.415
and then everything just...

06:55.502 --> 06:57.068
it just comes crashing down.

06:57.155 --> 06:58.287
Come here.

07:00.855 --> 07:03.335
But I can't let
the kids see it, you know?

07:03.423 --> 07:05.947
I have to...
oh, I gotta get it together.

07:06.034 --> 07:09.385
I gotta make things happy
and normal for them, you know?

07:09.472 --> 07:11.779
Beth, you are the most
amazing woman I know...

07:11.866 --> 07:13.911
and I once met
Ellen DeGeneres.

07:13.998 --> 07:15.391
Thank you.

07:15.478 --> 07:17.175
Hey, Mom, did you...

07:19.134 --> 07:20.614
Are you okay?

07:20.701 --> 07:22.398
Yeah, I'm okay.
I was just, um...

07:22.485 --> 07:25.096
C-cutting onions
for my oat...meal.

07:25.183 --> 07:27.055
- Yeah.
- You put onions

07:27.142 --> 07:29.100
- in your oatmeal?
- Oh, I put onions

07:29.187 --> 07:31.276
in everything--
except onion soup,

07:31.363 --> 07:34.062
which I prefer to make
with leeks.

07:34.149 --> 07:36.325
Oh, uh, Wyatt--
you have an appointment

07:36.412 --> 07:38.109
for the doctor today...
just, you know,

07:38.196 --> 07:39.937
make sure you're doing okay.

07:40.024 --> 07:41.896
So just like a checkup?

07:41.983 --> 07:43.550
Yeah.
Something like that.

07:43.637 --> 07:44.376
Okay.

07:44.464 --> 07:45.334
Okay.

07:47.989 --> 07:50.818
Hi there, Wyatt.

07:50.905 --> 07:51.993
I am...

07:53.864 --> 07:56.084
...not that kind of doctor.

07:56.171 --> 07:59.000
You're not

07:59.087 --> 08:02.133
Well, I am more of
a doctor for feelings.

08:02.220 --> 08:04.701
So we're just gonna
be talking today,

08:04.788 --> 08:08.226
but if you're more comfortable
doing that in your underpants,

08:08.313 --> 08:10.490
- that is absolutely--
- Oh, no.

08:10.577 --> 08:13.231
Um, I'm definitely,
definitely not.

08:17.497 --> 08:20.717
I'm Dr. Stevenson,
but you can call me Kay.

08:20.804 --> 08:24.112
'Kay...I mean, okay...
Kay?

08:26.070 --> 08:27.985
So, Wyatt, why don't you
tell me what's been going on?

08:29.639 --> 08:32.424
- Not much, really.
- Well, I understand

08:32.511 --> 08:34.208
that you lost your father.

08:34.296 --> 08:36.080
I'm really very sorry.

08:38.126 --> 08:38.996
Yeah.

08:40.258 --> 08:42.086
Is there anything you'd like
to talk about?

08:43.566 --> 08:46.177
Well...there is one thing.

08:48.919 --> 08:52.444
My dad left this book
for me and my brothers...

08:52.532 --> 08:54.882
and ever since then...

08:56.361 --> 08:59.408
...there's been
some weird stuff happening.

08:59.495 --> 09:01.541
Oh, yeah

09:01.628 --> 09:03.586
I don't know.

09:03.673 --> 09:04.674
I guess...

09:05.936 --> 09:09.374
I don't want you to think
that I'm cuckoo.

09:09.461 --> 09:10.854
Well, that's not really

09:10.941 --> 09:13.248
a term we use around here.

09:13.335 --> 09:15.467
I just want you
to feel comfortable.

09:15.555 --> 09:18.688
I talk to kids all the time,
so believe me.

09:18.775 --> 09:21.299
I am happy to hear
whatever you have to say.

09:21.386 --> 09:22.387
You'd be surprised

09:22.474 --> 09:23.519
by some of the stories.

09:23.606 --> 09:25.434
I mean, everything's...

09:44.714 --> 09:47.456
- Dad.
- Hey, champ.

09:47.543 --> 09:49.110
Why am I here?

09:49.197 --> 09:50.807
I thought a jungle adventure
might cheer you up.

09:50.894 --> 09:52.592
You always loved animals.

09:52.679 --> 09:54.332
Plus, I heard someone say
something

09:54.419 --> 09:56.465
about a cuckoo bird
somewhere around here.

09:56.552 --> 09:59.250
No, I mean, why am I here...

09:59.337 --> 10:01.818
talking to a non-underwear
doctor?

10:01.905 --> 10:03.515
Well...

10:03.603 --> 10:05.126
Hey, Dash.

10:05.213 --> 10:06.214
What are you doing here?

10:06.301 --> 10:07.911
Searching for the lost city

10:07.998 --> 10:09.217
of El Doritos.

10:09.304 --> 10:11.219
Don't you mean El Dorado?

10:11.306 --> 10:12.829
As long as they have
Cool Ranch flavor,

10:12.916 --> 10:14.396
I don't care what you call it.

10:14.483 --> 10:16.659
I smell jalapeños.
That way!

10:19.053 --> 10:21.185
Your brother always did
have a keen sense of smell.

10:23.492 --> 10:26.495
Dad?

10:26.582 --> 10:29.280
I really think Mom's
worried about me.

10:29.367 --> 10:31.282
Should I be worried about me?

10:31.369 --> 10:33.633
Well, your mom loves you
more than anything.

10:33.720 --> 10:35.635
And if she wanted you
to see a doctor,

10:35.722 --> 10:37.506
I'm sure it's for the best.

10:37.593 --> 10:42.032
But...does that mean
I am a cuckoo bird?

10:42.119 --> 10:44.295
No, son.
Not at all.

10:46.123 --> 10:47.603
But that is.

10:52.869 --> 10:55.524
Yoo-hoo! Yoo-hoo!
Wyatt?

10:55.611 --> 10:57.091
- - Hate to interrupt

10:57.178 --> 10:59.833
your daydream,
but our time is up.

10:59.920 --> 11:03.750
So maybe next time you can
tell me about Doritos

11:03.837 --> 11:08.624
or jalapeños, or whatever else
you're daydreaming about.

11:12.759 --> 11:16.284
Hah.
Nice try, universe.

11:23.857 --> 11:24.814
You know,
I really think

11:24.901 --> 11:26.076
I missed my calling.

11:26.163 --> 11:28.296
I could've been a foot model.

11:28.383 --> 11:32.300
These piggies definitely
should've gone to market.

11:32.387 --> 11:34.519
- I'm a little worried, Tiffany.
- Relax, Beth.

11:34.606 --> 11:36.870
I'm not ditching you
for the foot model circuit.

11:36.957 --> 11:39.829
It's way too much politics
to deal with.

11:39.916 --> 11:42.353
No, I'm talking about Wyatt.

11:42.440 --> 11:45.530
Dr. Stevenson wants
to see him again.

11:45.617 --> 11:47.315
That's not so bad.

11:47.402 --> 11:50.535
I prefer Ayurvedic healing
over conventional psychotherapy,

11:50.622 --> 11:52.668
but whatever helps, you know?

11:52.755 --> 11:54.322
It's just so hard pretending

11:54.409 --> 11:57.673
that everything is normal
and fine, you know?

11:57.760 --> 11:59.327
But I need to keep
the kids' spirits up.

11:59.414 --> 12:02.025
Yeah, that's all that matters
right now, right?

12:02.112 --> 12:05.115
Beth, kids are like the moon.

12:05.202 --> 12:07.030
They go through phases.

12:07.117 --> 12:10.860
Sometimes they're...
full of wonderment and joy,

12:10.947 --> 12:13.210
sometimes they're hidden
by clouds and...

12:13.297 --> 12:16.300
disappear for a few days.

12:16.387 --> 12:18.520
The most important thing
to remember

12:18.607 --> 12:21.479
is that kids,
just like the moon,

12:21.566 --> 12:24.700
need a strong center
to orbit around.

12:24.787 --> 12:26.484
Wow.

12:26.571 --> 12:29.270
That's really profound.

12:29.357 --> 12:31.185
Although, did you just suggest
that's it okay

12:31.272 --> 12:33.230
for kids to disappear
for a few days?

12:33.317 --> 12:35.885
Days, weeks, whatever.

12:35.972 --> 12:38.888
You know what?
Maybe a family game of Twister.

12:38.975 --> 12:40.411
That's always fun.

12:40.498 --> 12:42.109
I wonder if we still
have that board.

12:48.419 --> 12:50.378
Something you'd like
to talk about?

12:50.465 --> 12:52.336
Nope.
It was just another average,

12:52.423 --> 12:54.164
non-eventful day.

12:54.251 --> 12:57.124
Looks to me like you had
a "hex-cellent" day.

12:57.211 --> 12:58.690
There's no hex.

12:58.778 --> 13:00.692
Statistically speaking,
at some point in my life,

13:00.780 --> 13:03.130
a simultaneous bird-squirrel
attack was inevitable.

13:03.217 --> 13:04.566
No, sweetheart.

13:04.653 --> 13:07.003
The odds of it happening
were 50/50.

13:07.090 --> 13:09.049
Either the Universe
put a hex on you

13:09.136 --> 13:10.920
or it didn't.

13:11.007 --> 13:12.052
And it did.

13:35.597 --> 13:36.598
What up?

13:36.685 --> 13:38.208
Hey, Dash.

13:38.295 --> 13:40.950
- Can I ask you something?
- You just did.

13:41.037 --> 13:42.778
Can I ask you something else?

13:42.865 --> 13:44.606
You just did.
I can--I can do this all day.

13:44.693 --> 13:47.391
Come on, I'm serious.

13:47.478 --> 13:50.612
Have you noticed
anything strange

13:50.699 --> 13:52.701
happening since we got The Dangerous Book?

13:55.443 --> 13:57.924
Well, ever since we got
the book...

13:58.011 --> 14:00.187
I...I...

14:00.274 --> 14:02.319
You're not gonna laugh, are you?

14:02.406 --> 14:05.322
No.
No, not at all.

14:05.409 --> 14:07.150
What is it?

14:09.326 --> 14:11.111
I can see through walls.

14:11.198 --> 14:12.721
S-s-seriously?

14:12.808 --> 14:14.897
Of course not, lame-o!

14:14.984 --> 14:16.681
No one can see through walls.

14:16.768 --> 14:19.206
I mean, it's an awesome book,
but it's just a book.

14:20.555 --> 14:22.122
What !

14:22.209 --> 14:24.037
Come on! Ow!

14:24.124 --> 14:25.603
I'm in a tough spot here.

14:25.690 --> 14:27.518
I love making fun of you,
but I also love

14:27.605 --> 14:29.477
- watching Liam suffer.
- Get away from me!

14:29.564 --> 14:31.653
- Get away!
- Sorry, leaving wins.

14:45.667 --> 14:46.537
Hello?

14:49.323 --> 14:51.847
No...Patrick McKenna isn't here.

14:54.110 --> 14:57.853
No, he won't be home
any time soon.

14:57.940 --> 14:59.376
Please take us off your list.

15:11.823 --> 15:13.129
Hey, Mom.

15:13.216 --> 15:14.783
Hey, there's my little
Wyatt Earp.

15:14.870 --> 15:16.828
What do you think about
a game night tonight?

15:16.916 --> 15:18.308
So now, I mean,
I couldn't find Twister,

15:18.395 --> 15:20.528
but I did find the board
from Monopoly

15:20.615 --> 15:22.791
and some wedges
from Trivial Pursuit.

15:22.878 --> 15:25.098
- Hm?
- Uh...

15:25.185 --> 15:26.490
I'm not really
in the mood right now.

15:26.577 --> 15:28.057
Oh, no, come on!
It could be fun.

15:28.144 --> 15:29.754
I mean, we could invent
a new game

15:29.841 --> 15:31.365
like your dad used to do.
We'll call it, like, um,

15:31.452 --> 15:34.455
"Triv-opoly" or "Monopo-suit."

15:34.542 --> 15:36.936
That's okay.
Maybe another time.

15:45.814 --> 15:47.555
Tiffany, you gotta get those
tarot cards back out.

15:47.642 --> 15:49.296
The race was a disaster!

15:49.383 --> 15:51.211
- Lucky Louie didn't win

15:51.298 --> 15:53.126
He was still running
when they started the next race.

15:53.213 --> 15:55.041
Maybe somebody
put a whammy on the jockey.

15:55.128 --> 15:57.391
You know, he did have
unusually tiny feet.

15:57.478 --> 15:59.784
The horse or the jockey?

15:59.871 --> 16:01.177
Both!

16:01.264 --> 16:02.962
This whole family is cuckoo.

16:04.398 --> 16:06.269
How can I not be?

16:06.356 --> 16:09.142
The hoof--the hooves
were definitely small.

16:09.229 --> 16:10.404
Good news.
I think

16:10.491 --> 16:11.535
you're about to be off the hook

16:11.622 --> 16:13.189
for the desk standing stuff.

16:13.276 --> 16:15.409
Word on the street is
Nicky Dermer had to use

16:15.496 --> 16:17.715
his emergency pair of underwear.

16:17.802 --> 16:19.456
Mr. McKenna.

16:19.543 --> 16:20.805
Would you like to come to
the board

16:20.892 --> 16:22.111
and solve this equation?

16:23.678 --> 16:25.071
I realize I posed that
as a question,

16:25.158 --> 16:26.681
but you don't really
have a choice.

16:35.211 --> 16:37.126
Cuckoo.

16:58.843 --> 17:00.454
"Bad hair day."

17:00.541 --> 17:02.282
But this is the look
I was going for.

17:05.546 --> 17:06.982
What's the matter, kiddo?

17:07.069 --> 17:09.202
Dad...

17:09.289 --> 17:10.855
Am I crazy?

17:10.942 --> 17:12.596
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
C-come here.

17:12.683 --> 17:14.945
Come here.
Come here, Wyatt.

17:15.034 --> 17:17.992
No, you're not crazy.
W...why would you think that?

17:18.079 --> 17:19.864
I don't know.
It just seems like

17:19.951 --> 17:21.866
our whole family is nuts.

17:21.953 --> 17:24.434
- And I keep seeing you, and...
- Ah.

17:24.521 --> 17:25.392
I get it.

17:27.394 --> 17:29.918
Let's take a look
at my specimen shelf, here.

17:30.005 --> 17:31.876
That is Galileo.

17:33.487 --> 17:36.011
And that's good old Socrates.

17:36.098 --> 17:39.667
Two of the most creative
and famous geniuses in history.

17:39.754 --> 17:41.886
Know what they had
in common?

17:41.973 --> 17:43.236
They were both really tiny?

17:43.323 --> 17:44.933
Well, yeah.

17:45.020 --> 17:47.936
But they were also both
once considered crazy.

17:48.023 --> 17:49.459
Were they?

17:49.546 --> 17:51.157
Nope.

17:51.244 --> 17:53.159
They changed the way
we see the world,

17:53.246 --> 17:56.249
using only their brains
and their imagination.

17:56.336 --> 17:59.513
So did Marie Curie.
So did Georgia O'Keeffe.

17:59.600 --> 18:00.992
Everyone's imagination
has the power

18:01.080 --> 18:03.517
to transform the Universe,
Wyatt.

18:03.604 --> 18:05.649
But not everyone
can tap into it.

18:05.736 --> 18:07.608
You think maybe
that's what I'm doing?

18:07.695 --> 18:10.001
Maybe.

18:10.089 --> 18:11.699
Or maybe your imagination
is helping you

18:11.786 --> 18:14.571
to deal
with a difficult situation.

18:16.834 --> 18:18.619
You are not crazy.

18:21.491 --> 18:22.275
Thanks, Dad.

18:22.362 --> 18:23.537
I'm just really glad

18:23.624 --> 18:24.929
I get to keep seeing you.

18:25.016 --> 18:26.975
Yeah, me too.

18:27.062 --> 18:28.759
What do you say we take a crack
at Einstein's...

18:28.846 --> 18:30.413
I mean... What do you say

18:30.500 --> 18:31.545
we take a crack at my theory

18:31.632 --> 18:33.503
of gravitational waves?

18:33.590 --> 18:36.724
I have no idea what that means,
but...sure.

19:13.935 --> 19:15.371
Incredible.

19:15.458 --> 19:16.633
Al-although the answer
we were looking for

19:16.720 --> 19:18.766
was 1 and 2/3.

19:18.853 --> 19:20.681
Whoo!

19:24.293 --> 19:25.599
Okay.

19:25.686 --> 19:26.817
Damn it.

19:29.646 --> 19:30.865
Why aren't you working?

19:32.127 --> 19:34.564
Nothing is working.

19:34.651 --> 19:36.131
Are you okay, Mom?

19:38.046 --> 19:40.179
I'm sorry, Wyatt.
Sorry.

19:41.528 --> 19:43.007
- For what?
- Because...

19:43.094 --> 19:44.792
Because it's Thursday.
On Thursdays,

19:44.879 --> 19:47.098
your dad always made us
his famous grilled sandwiches

19:47.186 --> 19:49.449
and I just...I can't
get his darn machine to work.

19:58.762 --> 20:01.722
- No.
-

20:01.809 --> 20:04.072
What's going on?

20:04.159 --> 20:06.335
I'm sorry.

20:06.422 --> 20:09.295
You guys, I'm trying
to keep it normal for you,

20:09.382 --> 20:10.861
and I'm trying
to keep things happy,

20:10.948 --> 20:12.385
but I can't.

20:12.472 --> 20:15.257
I can't do it,
and I can't hide it anymore.

20:15.344 --> 20:19.305
It's okay, Mom.
It's okay to be sad.

20:19.392 --> 20:20.654
We all are.

20:22.699 --> 20:24.919
I know I am.

20:25.006 --> 20:26.225
Me too.

20:34.668 --> 20:38.062
I guess...this is just
how it's gonna have to be

20:38.149 --> 20:40.456
for a while, but...

20:40.543 --> 20:41.544
it'll get better.

20:42.893 --> 20:45.505
We can make it happen.

20:45.592 --> 20:47.333
We can make anything happen.

20:48.769 --> 20:49.944
Yeah, we're all gonna be okay.

20:50.031 --> 20:51.989
We'll be okay.
Hm?

20:55.210 --> 20:57.038
I love you guys.

21:00.041 --> 21:01.477
I just wish that
I could've gotten

21:01.564 --> 21:05.220
your dad's Sub-Sub to work,
you know?

21:05.307 --> 21:06.743
I loaded all the ingredients in,

21:06.830 --> 21:08.484
but nothing happened.

21:08.571 --> 21:09.746
Let me take a look.

21:23.630 --> 21:25.719
Oh!

21:28.156 --> 21:29.331
That was amazing!

21:29.418 --> 21:30.811
Can we do exploding sandwiches

21:30.898 --> 21:32.203
every Thursday?

21:41.952 --> 21:44.172
- I'm ready.
- Did you get everything?

21:44.259 --> 21:46.000
I think so.

21:46.087 --> 21:49.612
Two roly-polys,
four dog fingernails,

21:49.699 --> 21:53.312
lock of human hair...
and half of a fresh fig.

21:57.403 --> 21:58.534
Yum.

21:58.621 --> 22:00.319
Oh, that's pure potassium-bomb.

22:02.669 --> 22:07.151
Undoing a hex is
a very complicated procedure.

22:07.238 --> 22:09.153
They can't just be removed.

22:09.240 --> 22:11.286
They have to be transferred...

22:11.373 --> 22:12.896
into another vessel.

22:15.203 --> 22:17.379
Liam Gloucester McKenna...

22:17.466 --> 22:19.120
are you prepared
to humble yourself

22:19.207 --> 22:20.861
before the Universe?

22:20.948 --> 22:22.341
So prepared.

22:24.125 --> 22:25.735
I give you Liam,

22:25.822 --> 22:28.259
who humbly repents
for having doubted you.

22:31.001 --> 22:33.221
Yeah.
Super sorry!

22:33.308 --> 22:35.310
And from this day forward...

22:35.397 --> 22:37.704
he promises never... Uh-oh.

22:37.791 --> 22:39.401
The Bachelorette's
about to start.

22:39.488 --> 22:42.404
Um, promises to not ever
doubt the Universe again,

22:42.491 --> 22:44.841
keep an open mind,
et cetera, et cetera.

22:44.928 --> 22:47.409
Okay, the hex is off you
and in that glass of water.

22:47.496 --> 22:48.802
Get rid of it.

22:48.889 --> 22:50.281
Wait...what?

22:50.369 --> 22:51.370
Whoa, whoa, wait, wait, wait.

22:51.457 --> 22:53.197
Wait.

22:53.284 --> 22:55.548
That's it

22:57.637 --> 22:59.813
What's off, dweeb?

22:59.900 --> 23:01.467
Uh...

23:01.554 --> 23:02.859
Nothing.

23:06.210 --> 23:08.822
- - Ow, my foot!

23:10.432 --> 23:12.216
Ow, the rest of me!
