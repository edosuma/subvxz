11:15.943 --> 11:18.411
Jack shouldn't be launching
Biomax right now.

11:18.445 --> 11:19.713
It's not ready.

11:19.747 --> 11:21.481
These nanobots
are dangerous...

11:21.514 --> 11:22.883
Wait. Wait, did you hear that?

11:44.404 --> 11:45.472
Hey!

11:45.505 --> 11:47.507
(STAMMERS) Are you okay?
I heard about last night.

11:47.540 --> 11:49.943
Yeah. Uh, I'm fine. I just...
I need a favor from you.

11:49.977 --> 11:51.244
-(SIGHS) Yeah?
-The whistleblower I met with

11:51.278 --> 11:53.881
said Spheerical
faked their lab results.

11:53.914 --> 11:55.883
So I need to file a FOIA
with the FDA.

11:55.916 --> 11:57.484
You don't need CatCo's
help for that.

11:57.517 --> 11:59.753
Anybody can submit a Freedom
of Information Act request.

11:59.787 --> 12:04.091
Yes, but the government
will respond faster
if CatCo is the one to file.

12:04.124 --> 12:05.759
James, the
whistleblower died.

12:06.960 --> 12:09.229

12:09.262 --> 12:11.031
(CLICKS TONGUE) I'm gonna
get a FOIA for you.

12:11.064 --> 12:13.033

another cover,

12:13.066 --> 12:15.903

12:19.006 --> 12:20.340
Actually, I'm here
to file a FOIA...

12:20.373 --> 12:22.910
Actually, you're not.
Didn't I fire you?

12:22.943 --> 12:24.477
CatCo is off-limits.

12:24.511 --> 12:27.014
Actually it's not because
I'm here and she's my friend

12:27.047 --> 12:28.448
and she can visit
anytime she wants.

12:28.481 --> 12:30.851
But she can't use
CatCo resources.

12:30.884 --> 12:34.254
Well, I'm not the one
using CatCo's resources.
James is going to file it.

12:34.287 --> 12:37.024
(CLICKS TONGUE) Oh, go ahead.

who was supposedly

13:02.049 --> 13:04.885
a test subject for the

13:04.918 --> 13:06.153
I'm seeing him tonight.

13:10.858 --> 13:12.893
Hector, can you
cancel dinner?

13:12.926 --> 13:14.294
This is gonna take me
till at least eight o'clock,

13:14.327 --> 13:16.864
and I fully intend
on crashing afterwards.

13:16.897 --> 13:18.265
That's disappointing.

13:21.201 --> 13:22.870
-You don't
have an appointment.
-No.

13:23.971 --> 13:25.505
But I was hoping to get one.

13:27.007 --> 13:28.909
How did you get past Hector?

13:28.942 --> 13:30.944
No one's above a snack break.

13:30.978 --> 13:32.846

13:32.880 --> 13:34.948
you're free for dinner,
good news,

13:34.982 --> 13:37.851
but you have no interest
in dinner, bad news.

13:37.885 --> 13:41.154
It's been an
emotional roller coaster
since I walked in here.

13:41.188 --> 13:43.390
-Oh, yeah, you seem wrecked.
-Oh, completely.

13:43.423 --> 13:45.525
But I'm hoping
I don't have enough data.

13:45.558 --> 13:50.597
For instance,
would you be willing to go
to dinner if I was a factor?

13:51.331 --> 13:52.365
No.

13:53.566 --> 13:55.002
Are you mad at me?

13:55.035 --> 13:58.071
Is it because I cracked
the nano code alone?

13:58.105 --> 13:59.973
Seems petty for you.

14:00.007 --> 14:02.142
Just stop, Jacky.
You know I wish you
all the success.

14:02.175 --> 14:03.076
But?

14:03.110 --> 14:04.411
I'm still not going
for dinner with you.

14:09.516 --> 14:10.918
Do you have fun here?

14:13.053 --> 14:14.587
I feel good about
the work we do.

14:15.588 --> 14:17.624
You had fun with me.

things ended with us.

all the others turned.

19:00.307 --> 19:02.442

And then I realized I had been
modeling the nano swarm
on the wrong kind of animal.

19:18.291 --> 19:21.528
See, bees need a base,
a queen, to revolve around.

-Yeah.
-The nano swarm,
it migrates.

19:28.701 --> 19:30.403
-Yes.
-It's linked AI sentience.

19:30.437 --> 19:31.704

19:31.738 --> 19:34.374
through the

have gotten there

19:36.409 --> 19:38.245
if I hadn't been
thinking about you.

19:39.779 --> 19:41.781

I was also wondering...

-Maybe another time.
-Oh. Lena, are...
Are you, um...

You were hurt.

You know, I sometimes wonder
what would've happened
if I'd stayed.

21:07.367 --> 21:11.904
Maybe we would have
figured the nano swarm
out together.

Maybe I'd have

would have happened

22:06.426 --> 22:07.460

-Okay.

22:20.139 --> 22:21.874
Password was "starling."

22:22.709 --> 22:24.511
That romantic bastard.

22:24.544 --> 22:25.678
Okay. Here we go.

22:26.679 --> 22:28.615
-Human trials.

22:29.782 --> 22:32.652

The whistleblower was right.

22:32.685 --> 22:33.986
No, what about this one?

22:36.489 --> 22:38.791
Biomax version 38.

22:43.029 --> 22:44.797
Human trial one.

22:45.865 --> 22:47.567

aren't missing.

23:00.613 --> 23:02.415
There weren't
any human trials.

23:02.449 --> 23:04.717
Jack knew the nano swarm was
dangerous from the beginning.

23:04.751 --> 23:07.153
That's why Derrick and Joe
had to die.

23:07.186 --> 23:08.555
Jack's the killer.

23:08.588 --> 23:10.457
-Thumb drive.
-Oh, yes.

23:10.490 --> 23:11.791
Good idea.

23:12.525 --> 23:13.593
Got it.

23:16.596 --> 23:20.433
-Jack?
-I, uh... I have to go.

23:20.467 --> 23:23.102
Yeah. Of course.
I... I totally get it.

-Weird.

24:33.540 --> 24:35.708
Yeah, uh...

24:35.742 --> 24:37.677
I actually came here
to talk to you about Jack.

24:37.710 --> 24:38.711
Um...

24:39.879 --> 24:41.247
I've been investigating him...

24:41.280 --> 24:42.849
Yeah, I can tell. (LAUGHS)

24:44.884 --> 24:48.020
Lena, Biomax is dangerous
and he's covering it up.

24:50.690 --> 24:52.258
-That's not true.
-I'm not lying.

24:53.726 --> 24:55.528
Well, then you're mistaken.

24:55.562 --> 24:57.129
Jack would never hurt anyone.

25:18.851 --> 25:19.919
Just us.

25:22.254 --> 25:23.355
I won't ask you to bury it,

25:23.389 --> 25:26.659
but please let me go talk
to him before it gets out.

25:26.693 --> 25:29.729
Lena, he's killed two people.

25:29.762 --> 25:31.163
I know how you feel about him,

25:31.197 --> 25:33.800
but you will be the third
if you confront him.

25:35.668 --> 25:38.237
Please just promise me you'll
stay away from him for now.

25:38.270 --> 25:39.606
It's for your own safety.

25:44.243 --> 25:45.745
Thank you for telling me.

25:46.846 --> 25:48.881
I won't go see him, I promise.

Are you okay?

25:51.751 --> 25:53.185

I've got some work to do.

-Would you mind, Kara?
-Right, yeah. Of course.

26:00.660 --> 26:01.961
I'm really sorry.

26:03.029 --> 26:04.764
You were just doing your job.

Listen. Uh, look, I, um...

You kind of went
a little overboard

26:43.102 --> 26:45.337
with the kid
from the liquor store.

26:45.371 --> 26:46.673
Okay.

We can't have you with us.

It's all my research
on Spheerical.

28:35.114 --> 28:36.482
I thought I'd help your story.

28:39.786 --> 28:41.921
What's in it for
you, Ponytail?

28:41.954 --> 28:43.722
I know we've had
our differences...

28:45.925 --> 28:48.060
But I've learned
a lot from you.

28:49.395 --> 28:52.031
And the biggest thing
I have learned is that

28:52.064 --> 28:53.432
it's not the reporter
that matters,

28:53.465 --> 28:55.234
it's the truth that matters.

28:55.267 --> 28:58.838
And CatCo will get the truth
to more people.

28:58.871 --> 29:03.810
Also, I wanted the truth
to get out so badly
that I disobeyed you.

29:03.843 --> 29:05.211
I broke the rules.

29:06.578 --> 29:08.781
You were right.

29:08.815 --> 29:12.484
I got lucky when I posted
my first blog on Cadmus
without your permission.

I let you down,
and I apologize.

29:20.226 --> 29:21.227
Finally.

29:24.396 --> 29:26.799
So, anyway, this is
all the information

29:26.833 --> 29:28.400
I found on Spheerical,

29:28.434 --> 29:31.971
including an interview
with a whistleblower
named Joe Watkins.

29:32.004 --> 29:34.140
The Biomax human trials
were faked.

29:35.007 --> 29:36.843
Not bad, Danvers.

29:36.876 --> 29:38.945
I got the same confirmation
from a source
named Derrick Simmons.

29:38.978 --> 29:40.179
Before he was killed.

29:40.212 --> 29:42.281
I'm glad
our information lines up.

29:42.314 --> 29:44.817
Except Jack Spheer may
not have been the only one
involved in the cover-up.

29:44.851 --> 29:46.185
Beth Breen signed the checks.

29:46.218 --> 29:48.087
She's Spheerical's
chief financial officer.

29:48.120 --> 29:51.423
And she has a lot of money
riding on the success
of these nanobots.

29:51.457 --> 29:54.827
Biomax fails,
she stands to lose everything.

29:56.395 --> 29:57.196

29:57.229 --> 29:59.365
I have to go.

Uh, what's wrong?

30:16.048 --> 30:17.049
You lied to me.

30:18.584 --> 30:21.020
Everything I said last night
was the truth.

30:21.053 --> 30:22.588
I'm not talking
about us, Jack.

30:23.956 --> 30:25.424

What about it?

30:27.994 --> 30:30.329

You shot those things
into yourself.

You...

30:35.902 --> 30:37.036
...killed people.

Killed people?

30:38.504 --> 30:40.272
I don't know
what you're talking about.

30:40.306 --> 30:42.274
You knew...
We knew three years ago

30:42.308 --> 30:45.444
that the nano swarms
had a side effect.

30:45.477 --> 30:47.613
The rats' brain chemistry
was forever altered.

30:47.646 --> 30:49.916

We could make them do
whatever we wanted.

So who killed
all those people?

31:31.323 --> 31:32.691
Jack did.

31:32.724 --> 31:36.195
I mean, he didn't choose to,
and he doesn't remember,
but he did.

The poor, sweet boy
actually wanted to scrap
the whole thing

31:45.972 --> 31:49.708

a pesky little side effect
that removes free will.

to step in.

is a strong woman.

31:58.117 --> 31:59.285

31:59.318 --> 32:00.686

it works beautifully.

-Now you're going to kill me.

That's the only reason
you're telling me all of this.

-Again, not very
financially responsible.

33:27.806 --> 33:29.741

33:29.775 --> 33:31.743

(STRUGGLING)

33:38.484 --> 33:40.252
(PANTING)

33:40.286 --> 33:41.687
Jack, make it stop!

-(GASPS)

33:47.826 --> 33:49.361
(GASPING)

33:50.096 --> 33:51.163
Lena.

33:51.197 --> 33:52.198
(CRIES OUT IN PAIN)

33:56.368 --> 33:57.469
No!

33:58.204 --> 33:59.405
No!

34:01.740 --> 34:02.808
(GROANS)

34:04.343 --> 34:05.777
-No!
-Lena!

34:05.811 --> 34:09.448
-Jack!
-(GASPS) Lena, help!
The mainframe.

34:10.182 --> 34:12.184
(GROANING)

34:14.120 --> 34:16.388
I think I can override it!

34:16.422 --> 34:18.524
(STRUGGLING) Lena, hurry!

34:23.662 --> 34:26.432
-I'm almost there, okay?
-BETH: You'll kill him.

34:26.465 --> 34:28.767
The override
destroys the nanobots.

34:28.800 --> 34:31.803
They've merged with him.
You kill them, you kill him.

34:31.837 --> 34:33.305
(GRUNTS)

34:37.576 --> 34:39.145
(GROANING)

34:43.215 --> 34:44.783
I'm sorry, Jacky.

34:44.816 --> 34:46.252
(PANTING)

34:46.285 --> 34:48.086
Do it. Please.

34:50.456 --> 34:51.790
(GROANS)

34:51.823 --> 34:53.559
(SCREAMING)

34:55.827 --> 34:57.263

(GROANING)

35:20.219 --> 35:21.487
Jack.

35:32.598 --> 35:33.832
(DOOR OPENS)

35:38.837 --> 35:39.771
Those are beautiful.

35:39.805 --> 35:42.274
I wish there was more
I could do to help.

35:44.276 --> 35:46.845
Oh, you came to see me.
That's more than enough.

35:46.878 --> 35:49.281
(EXHALES SHARPLY)

35:49.315 --> 35:50.616
-Beth is in jail.
-Good.

35:56.288 --> 35:57.723
How are you holding up?

35:57.756 --> 36:00.392
When Lex was arrested,
my mother was there.

36:00.426 --> 36:02.494
My mother saw her son

36:02.528 --> 36:04.596
dragged, bleeding and
raving from her house.

36:04.630 --> 36:07.333
And when I got there,
Lillian was tidying his room

36:07.366 --> 36:10.236
like he'd been away
on a business trip.

36:12.238 --> 36:13.605
That's how I feel.

36:14.706 --> 36:16.708
Cold and calm.

36:18.344 --> 36:20.346
Until I think about
Beth dying in jail,

36:20.379 --> 36:21.613
and then I feel warm
for a minute.

36:21.647 --> 36:24.350
-You're in shock, Lena.
-I don't know.

36:24.383 --> 36:25.951
Loss does strange things
to my family,

36:25.984 --> 36:27.386
and I've lost a lot of people.

36:27.419 --> 36:28.820
Well, you're not
gonna lose me.

36:30.389 --> 36:32.324
I think when I
feel things again,

36:34.860 --> 36:36.762
I'm gonna be
very, very afraid...

36:39.298 --> 36:40.566
Of the person I might be.

36:43.335 --> 36:45.604
You don't have to be afraid.

36:47.773 --> 36:49.775
I'm right here.

36:49.808 --> 36:51.209
I'm not going anywhere.

36:51.743 --> 36:52.944
Promise?

36:55.314 --> 36:56.815
I will always be your friend.

36:58.284 --> 37:00.419
And I will always protect you.

37:01.753 --> 37:03.255
I promise.

37:07.393 --> 37:08.660
-(CRUNCHING)
-What up?

37:08.694 --> 37:10.696
Yeah? All right.

37:12.431 --> 37:13.599
-(SIGHS)
-So, uh...

37:13.632 --> 37:18.470
We have got a black
and white cat

37:18.504 --> 37:20.639
stuck up a tree, 4th and Main.
Boom!

37:20.672 --> 37:22.741
Winn...

37:22.774 --> 37:25.511
Uh, I'm sorry about what
happened with Lyra.

37:25.544 --> 37:27.513
Yeah, well,
three's a crowd, right?

37:27.546 --> 37:29.315
You know, I could have
handled it differently.

37:29.348 --> 37:32.884
I should have laid down some
ground rules for her first.

37:34.486 --> 37:36.555
(SNIFFLES) Okay.

37:36.588 --> 37:38.957
It's been a while
since I had a best friend.

37:42.328 --> 37:43.495
You're my brother.

37:46.031 --> 37:49.301
And I haven't felt like that
since Clark.

37:50.936 --> 37:54.005
And working with you,
it makes me happy.

37:54.606 --> 37:55.741
Me, too.

37:57.509 --> 37:59.511
But you know, um...

37:59.545 --> 38:01.380
Dude, so does Lyra. (SCOFFS)

38:01.413 --> 38:02.914
With that said...

38:04.983 --> 38:07.519
Hey!
Hey, what are you doing here?

38:07.553 --> 38:09.321
James invited me.

38:11.390 --> 38:12.591
Are you sure?

38:15.561 --> 38:17.329
Do you really want
to help people?

38:17.363 --> 38:18.897
Most days.

38:19.431 --> 38:21.066
(CHUCKLES)

38:21.099 --> 38:22.901
Okay, then you're going
to listen to everything
that I say.

38:23.535 --> 38:25.003
Sounds good to me.

38:28.507 --> 38:29.575
-(CHUCKLES)
-Now,

38:29.608 --> 38:32.478
what's this I hear about
a cat stuck up in a tree?

38:32.511 --> 38:33.412
I'm starving.

38:33.445 --> 38:35.347
(ALL LAUGHING)

38:38.584 --> 38:40.886
She's kidding, right?

38:40.919 --> 38:42.621
You know, I am not sure.

38:42.654 --> 38:43.755
(LAUGHS)

38:46.458 --> 38:49.561
Ms. Tessmacher!
Where's my Danish?

38:50.796 --> 38:53.432
My first successful
baking venture.

38:53.465 --> 38:56.468
Danish, fresh from the oven.

38:56.502 --> 38:59.405
The trick is, uh,
sea salt, actually,
because, uh...

38:59.438 --> 39:03.475
Sea salt can incorporate
better with the dough.

39:03.509 --> 39:04.443
I didn't know
you like to bake.

39:04.476 --> 39:07.045
There's a lot about me
you don't know, Danvers.

39:09.047 --> 39:10.682
I got you something, too.

39:13.719 --> 39:16.988
Thank you for not dragging
Jack through the mud.

39:17.022 --> 39:18.390
(CLICKS TONGUE)

39:18.424 --> 39:19.925
Look at the byline.

39:22.127 --> 39:23.462
You put my name in the byline?

39:23.495 --> 39:25.564
Your interview
with that whistleblower

39:25.597 --> 39:30.101
was instrumental in our
scoop of every other major
news organization out there.

39:31.937 --> 39:33.104
You, uh...

39:35.607 --> 39:37.142
You did good, Danvers.

39:39.478 --> 39:40.746
Thanks.

39:42.481 --> 39:43.715
(CLEARS THROAT)

39:44.450 --> 39:45.517
You're welcome.

39:48.053 --> 39:51.990
Um, I'm gonna get a jump start
on tomorrow's cover.

39:52.023 --> 39:54.893
Right, uh, yeah,
I'll get out of here.

39:54.926 --> 39:58.497
Oh, so now that you
share a byline with me,

39:58.530 --> 40:00.899
you're too good to work late?

40:00.932 --> 40:03.469
-But I thought...
-I just said you did
a good job, Danvers.

40:03.502 --> 40:04.870
You didn't give up,

40:04.903 --> 40:07.573
even when that
whistleblower got killed.

40:07.606 --> 40:10.842
You weren't afraid
to pursue the truth,
no matter what the risk.

40:10.876 --> 40:13.078
And we need more
reporters like that.

40:14.680 --> 40:18.517
More reporters like you,
who care about the truth.

40:23.121 --> 40:24.155
So I have my job back?

40:24.189 --> 40:26.792
Unless you're thinking
of starting a food truck.

40:33.632 --> 40:35.233
Don't start a food truck.

40:35.266 --> 40:37.135
(CHUCKLES)

40:37.168 --> 40:38.470
I'll go get us coffee.

40:40.906 --> 40:42.040
(SIGHS)

40:51.650 --> 40:52.851
WOMAN: Lena Luthor.

40:52.884 --> 40:54.252
I'm not seeing
anyone right now.

40:54.285 --> 40:57.122
I heard about your
colleague, Mr. Spheer.

40:57.155 --> 40:58.657
I'm so sorry.

41:02.060 --> 41:03.194
Who are you?

41:07.666 --> 41:09.635
My name is Rhea.

41:09.668 --> 41:12.037
I have a business proposition
for you.
