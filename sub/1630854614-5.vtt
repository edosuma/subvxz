WEBVTT

00:50.039 --> 00:51.159
Not now, dear.

01:15.519 --> 01:16.760
You know her, right?

01:19.480 --> 01:22.120
Annika? Yeah. Yeah, she's fantastic.

01:22.760 --> 01:24.959
Yeah, she's great,
she'll do whatever it takes.

01:25.439 --> 01:27.400
Well, almost.

01:37.760 --> 01:38.920
She's your pick, right?

01:39.439 --> 01:40.760
- For Antarctica.
- Yeah.

01:42.719 --> 01:43.840
It wasn't easy.

01:44.799 --> 01:46.239
You don't have to apologize.

01:47.200 --> 01:48.120
No, I don't.

01:48.760 --> 01:50.000
And you shouldn't either.

01:50.480 --> 01:51.680
Me? What for?

01:51.760 --> 01:54.000
Well, the polar nights,
they can be cold and long,

01:54.079 --> 01:57.640
you wouldn't want me to bring you along
for the wrong reasons, would you?

01:57.719 --> 01:58.760
Of course not.

01:59.879 --> 02:02.239
I mean, you're a great biologist
and all that, but...

02:04.079 --> 02:05.319
I need the very best.

02:15.159 --> 02:16.479
Bye, Arthur.

02:20.319 --> 02:21.439
Bye, sweetheart.

03:24.159 --> 03:25.759
Do you know who Arthur Wilde is?

03:27.240 --> 03:29.400
Yeah, who doesn't know
who Arthur Wilde is?

03:30.400 --> 03:31.520
Why?

03:31.919 --> 03:33.240
Is he gonna be a part of this?

03:33.599 --> 03:34.960
I think he is a genius.

03:35.520 --> 03:38.719
And there's...
There's no way he killed all those people.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.159
Yeah, he deserves another chance.

03:43.120 --> 03:45.520
To me he looks like a fair person.

03:48.159 --> 03:52.400
As I said, I don't know him,
but from what I've seen,

03:58.080 --> 03:59.520
he doesn't seem to be trusted.

04:03.680 --> 04:06.520
Nanashi Maru, this is Alexandria.
What's your position?

04:08.919 --> 04:11.319
<i>Alexandria, this is Nanashi Maru.</i>

04:11.680 --> 04:15.680
<i>Position: three-nine degrees,</i>
<i>zero-three minutes south,</i>

04:16.120 --> 04:19.600
<i>one-zero-nine degrees,</i>
<i>one-eight minutes west.</i>

04:19.680 --> 04:22.519
<i>On course, we'll be there in 13 hours.</i>

04:23.199 --> 04:24.839
Copy that. Thank you. Over.

04:35.480 --> 04:36.399
They're coming.

04:44.480 --> 04:45.879
Let's drink to that.

04:48.040 --> 04:49.360
Where did you get that from?

04:51.680 --> 04:53.879
Renaud's cabin.
I don't think he will mind.

04:57.399 --> 04:58.399
Hand it over.

04:58.759 --> 05:01.319
Take it easy.
It's not like we're sinking, are we?

05:05.000 --> 05:06.000
Was that a shot?

05:10.480 --> 05:12.120
- You okay?
- Did you hear that?

05:12.199 --> 05:13.319
Yeah.

05:13.399 --> 05:14.439
What's going on?

05:15.160 --> 05:16.199
Where's Arthur?

05:21.079 --> 05:22.199
Arthur!

05:22.920 --> 05:25.360
Let me see that.
Keep your hand up high.

05:26.279 --> 05:29.079
Oh, my God.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

05:29.160 --> 05:30.439
She tried to kill me.

05:31.000 --> 05:32.600
- Who?
- Gloria.

05:35.240 --> 05:37.000
Fuck! Fuck.

05:43.519 --> 05:44.839
Oh, my God.

05:46.600 --> 05:47.959
What happened?

05:49.160 --> 05:50.160
She's dead.

05:50.639 --> 05:53.600
- What the fuck happened?
- It was an accident, I swear.

05:54.439 --> 05:57.480
Oh, Jesus, I went...
I went to the bathroom,

05:57.560 --> 06:00.800
I came out, she was standing there,
she was holding my gun,

06:00.879 --> 06:02.439
she was pointing it at me.

06:03.079 --> 06:04.319
I swear to God!

06:04.399 --> 06:05.519
Oh, she's...

06:06.639 --> 06:09.879
- Then what?
- So then I went for the gun, right?

06:09.959 --> 06:12.279
I grabbed it by the barrel,
and it went off.

06:13.360 --> 06:15.240
It took parts of my hand with it.

06:15.600 --> 06:18.560
But I hung on and I fought,
and I fought, and I fought,

06:18.639 --> 06:20.120
and then came the second shot.

06:27.360 --> 06:28.519
The snitch.

06:29.360 --> 06:30.800
- What?
- What?

06:30.879 --> 06:32.079
What? What snitch?

06:34.879 --> 06:36.680
Someone's been stealing our research.

06:37.399 --> 06:39.000
That's the reason for the murders.

06:39.319 --> 06:42.360
You fucking psychos.
I told you it was one of them!

06:42.800 --> 06:45.920
Not Marcus, not Charlie, not any of us!
It was one of them all along!

06:46.000 --> 06:47.399
Stop it, Wil!

06:47.480 --> 06:49.680
Come on,
we need to take you to the infirmary.

06:49.759 --> 06:50.800
Wait. Okay.

06:52.079 --> 06:54.439
Wait, you think Gloria was a snitch?

06:56.800 --> 06:59.120
She didn't even want to be here.
Why would she...?

07:03.120 --> 07:04.279
It was her alright.

07:07.199 --> 07:08.279
It's Kowalski's.

07:09.000 --> 07:10.120
So?

07:10.199 --> 07:12.720
It's been missing
since the night he was killed.

07:12.800 --> 07:16.480
And the killer used it
to enter the lab to get rid of Zack.

07:17.079 --> 07:18.160
So it was her.

07:19.600 --> 07:21.680
First she killed Kowalski, then Zack

07:23.879 --> 07:25.480
and I was next on her list.

07:26.480 --> 07:27.800
There's no other explanation.

07:28.839 --> 07:31.199
We need to stop this hemorrhage, come on.

07:50.560 --> 07:52.519
Arthur! Arthur! Are you okay?

07:52.920 --> 07:58.319
Arthur. Arthur. Arthur, wake up!

07:59.879 --> 08:02.199
I'm not too involved in that whole case.

08:02.879 --> 08:06.079
Honestly, I don't do so well with drama.

08:06.879 --> 08:08.480
But...

08:08.560 --> 08:10.720
I mean, it wouldn't surprise me.

08:10.800 --> 08:12.480
He's a very special man, so...

08:13.839 --> 08:16.120
I guess it could be true, the accusations.

08:18.240 --> 08:19.399
Yuto?

08:20.839 --> 08:22.399
It's me, can I stay with you?

08:24.439 --> 08:25.439
Sure.

08:29.759 --> 08:33.480
- Sorry, I can't keep still.
- Yeah, me neither...

08:33.559 --> 08:34.639
It just doesn't add up.

08:35.240 --> 08:38.679
I know. She's the last person on this ship
that would do something like that.

08:38.759 --> 08:41.879
But why did she have Kowalski's keycard?
And what the fuck was she doing

08:41.960 --> 08:44.159
- in Arthur's cabin?
- She wanted to talk to him!

08:49.039 --> 08:50.120
Hey.

08:50.799 --> 08:51.840
Can I trust you?

08:52.679 --> 08:53.720
I don't know.

08:55.080 --> 08:56.440
Can you?

08:56.519 --> 08:58.840
I managed
to break into Kowalski's laptop.

08:59.559 --> 09:02.519
The day he died, he was looking
into some fucking molecule.

09:02.600 --> 09:05.320
- What? What molecule?
- I don't know, I'm no biologist.

09:05.399 --> 09:07.120
But Gloria freaked out when she saw it.

09:07.200 --> 09:10.120
That's why she went looking for Arthur.
She wanted to tell him about it.

09:10.200 --> 09:12.200
So what are you saying?
That Arthur is lying?

09:12.279 --> 09:15.200
I don't know!
But I don't trust him anymore.

09:16.559 --> 09:20.519
Look, Gloria was not a fucking snitch.

09:24.759 --> 09:25.799
You're right.

09:26.519 --> 09:27.480
She wasn't.

09:28.120 --> 09:29.240
How can you be so sure?

09:30.240 --> 09:31.279
I just know.

09:33.600 --> 09:34.720
Fuck.

09:34.799 --> 09:36.320
- It's you!
- Calm down! Calm down!

09:36.399 --> 09:37.519
I haven't killed anyone!

09:37.600 --> 09:41.080
Look, I wouldn't be telling you this
if I wanted to hurt you, alright?

09:42.480 --> 09:43.799
Why...? Why would you?

09:44.759 --> 09:46.080
Because I need your help.

09:47.679 --> 09:49.120
And I'm willing to pay for it.

09:51.879 --> 09:53.039
Five million.

09:54.799 --> 09:56.200
Five million dollars?

09:57.200 --> 10:00.159
But first, I need to see
that molecule in Kowalski's laptop.

10:06.519 --> 10:08.039
You managed to break in.

10:09.080 --> 10:11.039
Now, why in the world
wouldn't you tell me?

10:13.440 --> 10:14.519
I tried to.

10:15.080 --> 10:16.240
Anything interesting?

10:16.600 --> 10:18.679
I don't know.
What are you all looking for?

10:19.159 --> 10:21.480
You were the last
to talk to Gloria before she died.

10:22.159 --> 10:24.759
- I was not. That would be Arthur.
- You know what I mean.

10:25.720 --> 10:27.399
Did she do or say anything strange?

10:28.120 --> 10:30.120
- Not really.
- Not really.

10:33.200 --> 10:34.559
Are you sure?

10:34.639 --> 10:35.720
Yes, I'm sure.

10:36.320 --> 10:38.559
Then why do I get the feeling
that you're lying to me?

10:39.320 --> 10:40.879
Where you in cahoots with her?

10:41.240 --> 10:43.080
What? No! I promise!

10:43.159 --> 10:45.279
We were just working on the case.

10:46.960 --> 10:48.039
How's that going?

10:48.360 --> 10:49.519
We'll make it on time.

10:55.639 --> 10:56.679
You stay here.

10:56.759 --> 10:59.879
I don't want you walking around
with that fucking animal on the loose.

10:59.960 --> 11:01.480
Maybe I can help you with that?

11:03.600 --> 11:04.639
Thanks.

11:05.919 --> 11:07.080
I'll keep that in mind.

11:47.279 --> 11:48.679
- Hey.
- Hey.

11:51.279 --> 11:52.799
He's gonna be okay.

11:53.559 --> 11:55.159
There's something you need to see.

12:03.039 --> 12:04.960
Bloody hell, what the fuck is that?

12:05.039 --> 12:06.320
Looks like a burn.

12:06.399 --> 12:08.320
- But when did that happen?
- I have no idea.

12:13.000 --> 12:14.080
Hey! Hey!

12:14.639 --> 12:15.879
Hey, how are you feeling?

12:17.279 --> 12:18.759
That's the morphine.

12:18.840 --> 12:20.519
I can give you more when it wears off.

12:21.440 --> 12:24.960
I did my best, but you will want to see
a real doctor when you get back home.

12:25.519 --> 12:26.519
Thanks.

12:27.279 --> 12:28.639
What about your right arm?

12:29.279 --> 12:30.320
What the hell is that?

12:31.080 --> 12:32.120
Oh, this?

12:33.960 --> 12:36.240
It's a minor lab accident, an acid spill.

12:37.159 --> 12:39.200
- It's nothing.
- Doesn't look like nothing.

12:39.840 --> 12:42.279
It looks really bad.
I'll need to cauterize it.

12:42.759 --> 12:43.799
When did that happen?

12:44.480 --> 12:46.200
Six-seven days ago.

12:46.279 --> 12:49.039
- Why didn't you tell us?
- Because it's nothing, really.

12:50.639 --> 12:52.039
Don't worry.

12:55.399 --> 12:58.360
- It's not been the best of weeks, has it?
- The Japanese should be here

12:58.440 --> 13:00.039
in 13 hours. Get some rest.

13:02.480 --> 13:03.600
And Charlie?

13:05.200 --> 13:08.159
No news.
Let's hope he doesn't find a way out.

13:13.440 --> 13:14.399
So?

13:15.320 --> 13:17.919
Someone's stolen morphine and ketamine
from the cabinet.

13:18.000 --> 13:19.039
Fucking hell.

13:19.799 --> 13:21.120
Any junkies among the crew?

13:21.639 --> 13:22.879
No.

13:22.960 --> 13:26.440
Booze and pot for sure, but not this.
Not from my cabinet.

13:31.759 --> 13:32.840
You think it was him?

13:33.600 --> 13:34.679
The drugs?

13:36.559 --> 13:37.519
Come on.

13:38.240 --> 13:39.279
I don't know.

13:40.320 --> 13:41.799
But he must have needed something.

13:42.679 --> 13:44.559
But then again, all he had to do was ask.

13:48.320 --> 13:49.320
Thank you.

13:49.960 --> 13:51.120
One more thing.

13:53.039 --> 13:54.600
How the fuck did he have a gun?

13:56.639 --> 13:57.879
I gave it to him.

14:00.000 --> 14:01.080
Fuck!

14:16.279 --> 14:17.480
Wait!

14:22.200 --> 14:23.399
Where is it?

14:23.480 --> 14:25.480
- Where is what?
- Don't you fucking play with me!

14:25.559 --> 14:26.559
The gun!

14:26.960 --> 14:28.440
I haven't seen no gun.

14:29.360 --> 14:30.399
Me neither.

14:33.519 --> 14:34.720
Do you think I'm stupid?

14:36.480 --> 14:37.600
What if I did?

14:38.600 --> 14:39.759
Have you been drinking?

14:40.720 --> 14:41.759
What if I have?

14:46.240 --> 14:47.720
I swear I haven't seen no gun.

14:49.320 --> 14:50.399
Do you want to search us

14:50.480 --> 14:53.639
before or after
we take this to the pantry?

14:55.080 --> 14:56.799
Or maybe you want to take her yourself.

14:58.399 --> 14:59.720
Get the fuck out of here.

15:01.559 --> 15:03.679
- How could she?
- How could anyone?

15:06.600 --> 15:08.039
But Gloria? She's...

15:10.039 --> 15:12.480
If there's one thing
I've learned about human nature,

15:13.159 --> 15:17.000
it's that we're all
weak, miserable, frightened souls

15:17.639 --> 15:18.919
putting on a show.

15:20.559 --> 15:25.399
Pretending that we deserve
affection, attention, even love.

15:28.360 --> 15:29.600
We don't.

15:30.360 --> 15:31.679
It's a masquerade.

15:32.200 --> 15:33.360
That's all it is.

15:34.799 --> 15:36.559
And a cruel one too.

15:49.720 --> 15:51.200
Doctor Wilde, the cynic.

15:54.240 --> 15:55.519
It's my default setting.

15:58.320 --> 15:59.639
It's how I hide the fear.

16:00.679 --> 16:02.240
Also a brilliant scientist

16:02.879 --> 16:05.519
who has devoted his life
to finding a way to stop Climate Change,

16:05.600 --> 16:07.679
which will save millions of lives.

16:07.759 --> 16:09.080
It's not about the lives.

16:10.000 --> 16:11.720
We're on the verge of extinction.

16:12.919 --> 16:14.039
And we deserve it.

16:15.759 --> 16:18.480
- Why then? Why all the effort?
- Because they doubted me.

16:19.360 --> 16:21.639
They said it couldn't be done.
They even laughed at me.

16:22.080 --> 16:24.559
And then they put me in jail
for crimes I didn't commit.

16:32.600 --> 16:34.360
There is one life I want to save.

16:35.960 --> 16:38.480
And I'd save the whole world just for her.

16:40.240 --> 16:42.720
It hit me when I was in jail
how wrong I'd been.

16:44.720 --> 16:45.879
How sorry I was.

16:49.960 --> 16:52.360
Humanity may not deserve to be saved.

16:53.200 --> 16:55.759
And I may not deserve your forgiveness.

16:57.159 --> 16:58.559
But that's all I want, Rachel.

17:01.759 --> 17:02.799
That's all I need.

17:36.680 --> 17:37.960
Wil, look.

17:38.039 --> 17:39.119
The shoelace.

17:39.599 --> 17:40.720
What's that?

17:43.359 --> 17:44.640
Fucking weirdos.

18:06.480 --> 18:08.160
I have a client willing to pay millions

18:08.240 --> 18:10.079
for a sample of the algae
and all of our data.

18:11.640 --> 18:14.319
We just need to transfer
all the files into this drive.

18:14.400 --> 18:16.759
So the PBR in the container...
That was you?

18:17.359 --> 18:20.000
Yeah, my client managed
to sneak that into the ship.

18:20.640 --> 18:22.680
Who are they, your clients?

18:24.240 --> 18:25.440
They're the good guys.

18:26.359 --> 18:28.319
Of course, the good guys.

18:29.799 --> 18:31.640
Who do you think got Arthur out of jail?

18:32.160 --> 18:33.359
Fucking Greenpeace?

18:34.119 --> 18:36.759
Look, he doesn't deserve to be the hero.

18:39.559 --> 18:40.759
But you and me...

18:42.599 --> 18:45.279
Don't we deserve
some kind of compensation for all of this?

18:46.200 --> 18:47.240
We sure do.

18:48.880 --> 18:50.079
Now,

18:51.079 --> 18:52.440
cross your fingers.

18:54.400 --> 18:55.960
- Yeah!
- Yeah.

18:56.759 --> 18:57.880
Okay.

18:59.079 --> 19:01.240
Now, we need a second case,
just like this one.

19:02.200 --> 19:03.640
Can you get it done in time?

19:58.880 --> 19:59.960
Hello?

20:02.640 --> 20:03.759
Good afternoon.

20:05.559 --> 20:07.279
I hope you had a good night's sleep.

20:09.920 --> 20:10.960
Who are you?

20:11.640 --> 20:12.640
A friend.

20:13.559 --> 20:16.440
My apologies
for the unagreeable reception.

20:18.599 --> 20:21.559
Why am I here?
Do you work for Arthur?

20:22.519 --> 20:24.359
I was hoping we might help each other.

20:26.160 --> 20:27.400
By kidnapping me?

20:28.839 --> 20:30.359
Consider yourself my guest.

20:36.319 --> 20:37.519
I need your confession.

20:39.359 --> 20:40.599
On tape.

20:42.319 --> 20:46.480
The Polaris VI murders,
your attempt to frame Doctor Wilde,

20:47.279 --> 20:48.519
your lies in court.

20:49.000 --> 20:50.319
Everything.

20:50.400 --> 20:51.799
After what you did to Sylvia?

20:56.839 --> 20:58.599
I don't know what you're talking about.

21:01.319 --> 21:04.559
Your confession would allow me
to carry on with my plans.

21:08.400 --> 21:12.079
In exchange, I would allow you
to carry on with yours.

21:13.000 --> 21:14.519
And what are you plans?

21:15.319 --> 21:19.920
I, the people I represent,
need to protect our investment.

21:21.119 --> 21:24.759
I don't particularly like Doctor Wilde,
but we believe in his vision.

21:25.720 --> 21:28.359
- You want to save the planet.
- That would be great, yes.

21:29.319 --> 21:31.240
For image and fiscal reasons, mainly.

21:32.400 --> 21:34.559
The scientific results so far
have been excellent,

21:34.640 --> 21:36.079
but we've run out of funds.

21:37.039 --> 21:39.960
I need to raise a few more million
for the next phase.

21:40.359 --> 21:42.279
That's why I need your confession.

21:43.559 --> 21:44.680
To get him money?

21:47.119 --> 21:52.000
If everyone believes that Doctor Wilde
is not only a brilliant scientist,

21:52.480 --> 21:55.839
but an honorable citizen too,
it would make things much easier.

21:55.920 --> 21:57.640
But he's not honorable.

21:59.319 --> 22:00.400
I'm sure he isn't.

22:01.839 --> 22:04.160
We all have
our bright and dark sides, don't we?

22:05.640 --> 22:08.440
You look like a nice, sensible,
young woman yourself.

22:09.720 --> 22:13.799
Look, Doctor Wilde
has found what he was looking for.

22:14.839 --> 22:16.400
We've got it.

22:16.480 --> 22:18.920
I still need his name to raise more funds,

22:19.720 --> 22:21.799
but we don't really need him anymore.

22:22.400 --> 22:24.440
Other scientists could take it from here.

22:25.359 --> 22:27.319
You might even be better off without him.

22:28.160 --> 22:29.359
Better for your image.

22:30.440 --> 22:35.359
Also, if anything were to happen
to Doctor Wilde,

22:36.519 --> 22:37.839
God forbid,

22:39.000 --> 22:41.200
your confession
would never need to go public.

22:42.000 --> 22:43.160
What if I don't do it?

22:44.240 --> 22:45.839
What if I refuse?

22:45.920 --> 22:47.400
I'm afraid that's not an option.

23:16.640 --> 23:17.680
Alec.

23:18.720 --> 23:21.119
What are you doing out here?
You need to stay in your cabin,

23:21.200 --> 23:24.160
- for fuck's sake, Rachel!
- I know, I just needed some air.

23:24.240 --> 23:25.319
Alright.

23:26.559 --> 23:28.839
- Is that Kowalski's?
- Yeah.

23:29.440 --> 23:30.759
Yuto got it unlocked.

23:31.240 --> 23:33.160
- Have you found anything?
- Not yet, no.

23:34.279 --> 23:36.640
- Nine hours and we're out of here.
- Mister Kurtz?

23:38.079 --> 23:40.759
- May I speak with you?
- Yes, what is it?

23:41.240 --> 23:42.240
It's probably nothing.

23:42.319 --> 23:44.279
But I'd rather have you decide
for yourself.

23:44.359 --> 23:46.240
- Go ahead.
- It's about Gloria.

23:48.279 --> 23:49.559
What about Gloria?

23:55.759 --> 23:57.240
You've got to be kidding me!

23:57.319 --> 23:58.839
Yuto! Still?

23:59.640 --> 24:01.880
Our first try wasn't working.
I've made some changes.

24:02.240 --> 24:05.000
We don't have the time!
We're leaving in eight hours!

24:05.599 --> 24:07.799
I know, I got it.
It will be on time. I promise.

24:08.599 --> 24:10.359
Don't look at me. It's in his hands.

24:10.759 --> 24:12.680
Get it right, for Christ's sake, Yuto.

24:13.599 --> 24:15.920
I think you and I
should go and check the samples.

24:30.839 --> 24:32.359
People surprise you, don't they?

24:33.200 --> 24:35.279
- What?
- Gloria.

24:36.240 --> 24:37.640
Trying to steal our findings.

24:38.920 --> 24:40.039
Yeah.

24:40.440 --> 24:41.480
I know.

24:42.960 --> 24:45.880
I was leaning more in your direction,
to be honest.

24:48.680 --> 24:49.759
Excuse me?

24:49.839 --> 24:52.240
Well, we do have a past, don't we?
You and I.

24:53.920 --> 24:57.920
Maybe you still have
some hard feelings towards me.

24:58.519 --> 24:59.480
Come on.

25:00.200 --> 25:01.240
It's been ages.

25:03.039 --> 25:04.559
You know what?
I was young and stupid.

25:04.640 --> 25:06.839
Yeah, but you're older now, aren't you?

25:07.599 --> 25:08.920
More to lose.

25:09.000 --> 25:10.079
More at stake.

25:10.960 --> 25:12.680
A family, for example.

25:14.559 --> 25:16.359
What does that have to do with anything?

25:17.000 --> 25:18.680
This is not a game, Amy.

25:19.599 --> 25:21.000
The people funding this project

25:21.079 --> 25:23.039
would do anything
to protect their investment.

25:23.119 --> 25:24.160
Anything.

25:24.240 --> 25:26.000
Now, I don't believe that you'd be willing

25:26.079 --> 25:28.240
to put your little boy
and your little girl

25:28.319 --> 25:30.920
on the line just to get back at me now,
would you?

25:32.680 --> 25:33.720
Of course not.

25:39.640 --> 25:41.160
You have a daughter yourself.

25:44.079 --> 25:45.240
You know how it is.

25:49.079 --> 25:50.079
That's right.

25:51.799 --> 25:52.839
I do.

26:13.920 --> 26:15.680
"Transfer interrupted.

26:17.880 --> 26:19.000
11:09."

26:29.160 --> 26:30.160
Hey.

26:31.559 --> 26:32.640
Are you okay?

26:34.240 --> 26:36.720
Yuto says
he can make the PBR in time.

26:37.440 --> 26:38.759
And I'm not so sure.

26:38.839 --> 26:41.799
Have faith, he broke
into Kowalski's laptop pretty quick.

26:41.880 --> 26:43.319
- Did he?
- Yeah, it's good.

26:43.400 --> 26:44.920
Alec's looking over it right now.

26:45.319 --> 26:47.200
- Wow.
- Yeah.

26:52.119 --> 26:53.880
Is your hand hurting? Are you okay?

26:57.559 --> 26:58.920
Fine.

26:59.759 --> 27:01.359
I think you need to get some rest.

27:05.279 --> 27:06.400
Wait.

27:09.400 --> 27:12.920
Gloria's shoelace
was tied around her ankle.

27:14.119 --> 27:15.880
Do you know anything about that?

27:17.559 --> 27:18.519
No.

27:19.200 --> 27:20.920
It's... Just Alec said...

27:21.480 --> 27:23.039
It's nothing. I think it's nothing.

27:23.880 --> 27:26.359
Well, I'm sure
that if Alec's looking into it,

27:27.960 --> 27:29.599
he's going to get to the bottom of it.

27:30.319 --> 27:31.359
Yeah.

27:37.000 --> 27:38.640
Of course I know who Arthur is.

27:39.680 --> 27:41.039
Amazing colleague.

27:43.240 --> 27:45.119
Great scientist.

27:45.200 --> 27:47.559
I admire his stamina, I think...

27:48.960 --> 27:51.519
Projects like these
need people like Arthur

27:51.599 --> 27:53.039
to get off the ground.

27:53.960 --> 27:55.680
I think he's a smart man.

27:57.559 --> 27:58.680
Maybe too smart.

28:19.640 --> 28:21.000
I fucking knew you'd come.

28:22.000 --> 28:23.279
Go on, check her leg.

28:24.599 --> 28:26.039
The shoelace was just a sign.

28:48.559 --> 28:49.599
Alec.

28:51.200 --> 28:53.599
- This is not what it seems.
- Drop the act, Arthur!

28:54.119 --> 28:55.400
It's over!

28:56.279 --> 28:57.680
- You killed Kowalski.
- What?

28:57.759 --> 28:58.680
Shut up.

29:00.480 --> 29:02.319
When I found your DNA under his nails,

29:03.440 --> 29:05.960
you tried to fool me
into doing the tests on board

29:06.039 --> 29:07.559
so you could manipulate them.

29:07.640 --> 29:08.640
Nonsense.

29:08.720 --> 29:11.400
Then you killed Zack
and you framed Charlie.

29:11.480 --> 29:14.319
And the three men Charlie killed,
you can add them to your tally.

29:14.400 --> 29:16.039
Are you even listening to yourself?

29:18.160 --> 29:19.440
You killed Gloria too.

29:22.000 --> 29:24.440
You put Kowalski's card
in her pocket to fool us.

29:25.880 --> 29:26.880
Are you done?

29:28.839 --> 29:30.480
- What happened to your arm?
- I told you.

29:30.559 --> 29:32.400
- It was an accident.
- Why keep it secret?

29:33.000 --> 29:35.079
Why steal morphine from the infirmary?

29:36.319 --> 29:39.240
- Erika would've given it to you.
- Because I don't trust her.

29:39.319 --> 29:40.359
I don't trust you!

29:41.079 --> 29:42.640
I don't trust anyone!

29:43.920 --> 29:46.119
Because you see,
this has happened to me before!

29:47.319 --> 29:49.000
The exact same thing!

29:50.400 --> 29:55.359
Not just the murders, the accusations,
the suspicions, the injustice,

29:56.000 --> 29:57.799
but being framed too!

29:59.319 --> 30:00.559
"It's Arthur."

30:02.359 --> 30:03.559
Really?

30:04.240 --> 30:06.119
Is that the best you can do?

30:06.759 --> 30:09.240
It's ridiculous!
Anyone could have written that!

30:10.880 --> 30:15.599
And your sad little hypothesis
is lacking a key element.

30:18.599 --> 30:19.720
A motive.

30:20.759 --> 30:22.000
Yes, that's right.

30:23.440 --> 30:26.279
Now, why the fuck would I kill my team

30:26.359 --> 30:29.480
when I've just made one
of the greatest scientific breakthroughs

30:29.559 --> 30:31.240
of the modern era?

30:34.799 --> 30:35.839
I don't know.

30:36.400 --> 30:37.759
No, you don't, do you?

30:39.480 --> 30:40.640
And do you know why?

30:43.119 --> 30:45.119
Because you're fucking useless.

30:45.599 --> 30:48.319
Fuck it!
Enough with your fucking lies!

30:48.920 --> 30:52.480
My mission is to deliver
both you and your research,

30:52.559 --> 30:53.880
and that is what I will do.

30:55.000 --> 30:56.880
They will make the call, not me.

30:57.799 --> 31:02.200
As for you, you will stay in your cabin
until we get rescued.

31:02.559 --> 31:04.160
And if you try fucking anything,

31:04.240 --> 31:07.079
then I fucking swear
I'll break your fucking neck

31:07.160 --> 31:09.279
with my own hands. Do you understand?

32:33.839 --> 32:34.960
Fuck.

32:59.200 --> 33:00.279
100?

33:00.759 --> 33:02.440
You were gonna do it for 100,000?

33:02.519 --> 33:03.559
Yeah!

33:04.519 --> 33:05.720
What's so fucking funny?

33:08.039 --> 33:10.519
Mister Wan's deal was half a million.

33:12.319 --> 33:13.400
No fucking way!

33:17.000 --> 33:18.039
Here you are!

33:18.119 --> 33:20.960
- Charlie has dropped the lifeboats!
- Well, let the boy have his fun.

33:21.039 --> 33:22.160
He's up to something.

33:22.519 --> 33:25.039
- We need to secure the rescue boat now.
- Go ahead.

33:25.799 --> 33:27.039
Enough with the drinking.

33:31.119 --> 33:32.400
Give me that bottle, sailor.

33:33.440 --> 33:34.799
Why don't you join us?

33:35.920 --> 33:37.440
Relax.

33:38.200 --> 33:39.240
This is over.

33:40.319 --> 33:41.599
Give me that bottle.

33:41.960 --> 33:43.720
- Now.
- Or what?

33:44.920 --> 33:46.240
What are you gonna do?

33:46.319 --> 33:48.079
- Hey, Wil, Wil...
- What are you gonna do?

33:48.160 --> 33:50.000
- Take it easy.
- Let go of me!

34:03.440 --> 34:05.000
Are you sure you want the bottle?

34:07.240 --> 34:09.079
- No.
- Are you sure?

34:09.599 --> 34:10.719
I'm sure.

34:11.079 --> 34:12.039
That's what I thought.

34:24.360 --> 34:27.119
I didn't have time
to design a proper case.

34:27.199 --> 34:30.920
I used a plastic box from Wan's kitchen
and will do the work.

34:38.199 --> 34:39.199
Perfect.

34:40.039 --> 34:42.119
I will take this,
and you take the hard drive.

34:42.199 --> 34:44.199
I'll take both, stay back.

34:45.360 --> 34:48.159
- This is liquid hydrogen.
- What?

34:49.280 --> 34:52.719
It will freeze you to death.
Just like you tried to do with Rachel.

34:53.360 --> 34:55.360
How... Why do you think I...

34:55.440 --> 34:57.679
You were copying files to your hard drive.

34:58.360 --> 35:00.960
When Rachel did that thing
and the lights went out,

35:01.039 --> 35:02.440
the transfer was interrupted.

35:03.360 --> 35:05.760
Exactly at 11:09.

35:05.840 --> 35:07.000
Wait, I can explain.

35:07.079 --> 35:08.880
You just needed me
to get you a second case.

35:08.960 --> 35:10.679
And once you have it,
you're gonna kill me,

35:10.760 --> 35:12.880
just like you killed everybody else.

35:12.960 --> 35:14.800
- No, I didn't! I swear!
- Don't move!

35:16.880 --> 35:17.880
Okay.

35:19.320 --> 35:20.320
Okay.

35:22.079 --> 35:24.159
I locked Rachel in the freezer.

35:25.400 --> 35:26.360
That was me.

36:01.119 --> 36:02.119
Who's there?

36:06.679 --> 36:07.880
Hey, hey, let me out!

36:10.440 --> 36:12.559
<i>I needed to get</i>
<i>the files from her computer.</i>

36:12.639 --> 36:13.960
<i>But that's all I wanted.</i>

36:14.639 --> 36:16.119
<i>I wasn't going to let her die!</i>

36:16.199 --> 36:17.199
Let me out!

36:18.400 --> 36:20.280
Please, let me out!

36:20.719 --> 36:22.039
Let me out!

36:24.639 --> 36:25.760
Let me out!

36:29.199 --> 36:32.159
I was going to let her out,
but I needed an alibi.

36:33.320 --> 36:34.400
Move it!

36:34.760 --> 36:36.559
- They found him.
- Go inside the boat, now!

36:37.760 --> 36:38.760
- Ready?
- Yes!

36:38.840 --> 36:39.960
<i>You were all up on deck.</i>

36:40.039 --> 36:41.239
Shit, it's stuck.

36:42.599 --> 36:45.119
- Stay back!
- Oh, for Christ's sake!

36:45.199 --> 36:47.280
I'm sorry, I can't watch this.

36:47.760 --> 36:50.159
<i>I joined you for like a minute</i>
<i>and then I came back.</i>

36:51.079 --> 36:54.639
<i>I was going to get her out,</i>
<i>but then the door wasn't working and...</i>

36:55.360 --> 36:56.400
Rachel!

36:59.360 --> 37:01.800
<i>Look, I know how this looks,</i>
<i>but you have to believe me.</i>

37:01.880 --> 37:05.079
I did not want to hurt her
or anybody else, please.

37:05.159 --> 37:07.159
- It wasn't me!
- Just don't come any closer!

37:07.239 --> 37:09.199
- Yuto, please!
- Don't fucking move!

38:24.840 --> 38:27.880
VALPARAISO PORT

38:30.880 --> 38:33.119
- The engine's back on.
- But we're not moving.

38:39.880 --> 38:40.800
He's cut us off!

38:49.280 --> 38:50.519
The engine is overheating.

38:52.199 --> 38:53.960
- What's going on?
- It's Charlie.

38:54.960 --> 38:56.400
He's trying to blow up the ship.

39:08.360 --> 39:10.199
My name is Olivia Jackson,

39:12.519 --> 39:16.840
daughter of the late Sarah Jackson,
who died at the Polaris V Station.

39:19.960 --> 39:24.039
I believe Arthur Wilde
was responsible for my mother's death.

39:25.840 --> 39:28.519
And his crew helped cover it up
to protect the research.

39:31.320 --> 39:34.760
<i>When I discovered Arthur Wilde</i>
<i>and his team were going to Polaris VI,</i>

39:35.199 --> 39:38.000
<i>I managed to join</i>
<i>under the name of Margaret Mitchell.</i>

39:39.199 --> 39:42.039
It was then that I killed them all,
one by one,

39:42.119 --> 39:43.960
leaving only Arthur Wilde alive.

39:47.440 --> 39:49.760
I spared his life for the sole purpose

39:49.840 --> 39:52.320
of framing him
for the murders I perpetrated.

39:56.000 --> 39:57.400
I did it for my mother.

40:08.159 --> 40:09.440
And I would do it again.
