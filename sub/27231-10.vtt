WEBVTT

01:12.172 --> 01:14.174
[RuPaul] Previously
on All Stars...

01:14.174 --> 01:18.278
You'll be overacting
in Sex and the Kitty, Girl 3.

01:18.278 --> 01:19.379
I'm excited.

01:19.379 --> 01:21.581
-I'll choose SJP.
-Uh-uh.

01:21.581 --> 01:24.117
I'm running for office!

01:24.117 --> 01:28.889
It's about time
you got your ballot box stuffed.

01:28.889 --> 01:30.357
Come on, say it with me,
ladies.

01:30.357 --> 01:32.659
Free the nipple!

01:32.659 --> 01:35.395
Please stop talking
about female issues.

01:35.395 --> 01:38.732
This movie needs
more female fashion.

01:41.101 --> 01:42.970
I'm getting paid for this,
right?

01:42.970 --> 01:46.073
Monique Heart, Trinity
The Tuck, con-drag-ulations.

01:46.073 --> 01:48.742
You are the top two All Stars
of the week.

01:48.742 --> 01:50.711
Who do you think
should go home?

01:50.711 --> 01:52.546
Naomi did the worst
in this challenge.

01:52.546 --> 01:54.648
She took on a bit more
than she could chew on.

01:54.648 --> 01:55.649
You don't think
that you deserve

01:55.649 --> 01:56.650
to be the bottom at all.

01:56.650 --> 01:58.352
Well, based on
my critique, no.

01:58.352 --> 02:03.490
Trinity, which queen
have you chosen to get the chop?

02:03.490 --> 02:05.092
I'm sending home Latrice.

02:05.092 --> 02:08.729
Latrice Royale, sashay away.

02:11.098 --> 02:14.267
[RuPaul]
My top four All Stars.

02:14.267 --> 02:15.936
Monique Heart.

02:15.936 --> 02:17.337
[Michelle] You were so in it

02:17.337 --> 02:20.140
every second of the way.

02:20.140 --> 02:23.176
I'm here to take the crown.

02:23.176 --> 02:24.811
[RuPaul] Trinity The Tuck,

02:24.811 --> 02:27.314
this is the top level of drag.

02:27.314 --> 02:28.882
You're doing it right here
right now.

02:28.882 --> 02:31.084
[Trinity] I am a super queen.

02:31.084 --> 02:34.788
I will slay whatever bitch
I have to to win.

02:34.788 --> 02:36.657
[RuPaul] Naomi Smalls.

02:36.657 --> 02:39.426
[Carson] That intersection
where drag and glamour

02:39.426 --> 02:42.129
meets comedy,
for me, that's great drag.

02:42.129 --> 02:44.264
[Naomi] I came here for a crown,

02:44.264 --> 02:45.499
and it needs to be mine.

02:45.499 --> 02:47.901
[RuPaul] Monét X Change.

02:47.901 --> 02:49.770
It was a joy to watch you

02:49.770 --> 02:52.606
because you had the audience
in the palm of your hand.

02:52.606 --> 02:55.675
[Monét] I want to be at the end
with a crown and scepter,

02:55.675 --> 02:58.278
and I would do whatever it takes
to get there.

03:04.885 --> 03:06.553
[sighs]

03:06.553 --> 03:08.321
♪ Kitty cat, kitty cat,
kitty cat ♪

03:08.321 --> 03:10.290
Did she leave a note?

03:10.290 --> 03:14.161
"Still a queen.
Bye. See ya. Latrice."

03:14.161 --> 03:15.796
Amen, Miss Lala.

03:15.796 --> 03:17.731
[Trinity]
I just eliminated Latrice.

03:17.731 --> 03:20.333
It was a hard decision
because I love Latrice.

03:20.333 --> 03:21.568
Who doesn't love Latrice?

03:21.568 --> 03:25.806
But we are down
to the nitty gritty,

03:25.806 --> 03:28.241
itty bitty titty, okay?

03:28.241 --> 03:29.910
At the end of the day,

03:29.910 --> 03:33.580
Latrice has punched the clock
too many times,

03:33.580 --> 03:35.449
there's been
too many chances given,

03:35.449 --> 03:37.784
and it was her time to go.

03:37.784 --> 03:40.353
I mean, I honestly did not know
who I was gonna pick.

03:40.353 --> 03:43.957
After talking to all of y'all,
everybody made good points,

03:43.957 --> 03:45.392
she made good points.

03:45.392 --> 03:47.494
Like what?
I'm really curious.

03:47.494 --> 03:50.797
She made a good point
that Naomi chose her role

03:50.797 --> 03:53.033
and that she got
the worst critique

03:53.033 --> 03:54.034
and that she made her bed,
so lie in it.

03:54.034 --> 03:55.035
Got it.

03:55.035 --> 03:57.237
I told you bitches

03:57.237 --> 03:58.738
when we first got here

03:58.738 --> 04:01.374
that I was going to do my best

04:01.374 --> 04:03.777
to judge with integrity

04:03.777 --> 04:05.712
and as fair
as I possibly could.

04:05.712 --> 04:08.415
And I could not possible
eliminate one of you two

04:08.415 --> 04:10.250
to save her.

04:10.250 --> 04:12.786
Okay, well, I'm the best
and that's why I'm here, okay?

04:12.786 --> 04:14.321
[all laugh]

04:14.321 --> 04:17.724
I just solidified my spot
in the top four,

04:17.724 --> 04:21.695
and I know moving on,
I have to give 110%

04:21.695 --> 04:23.897
because it's gonna get
hard as hell.

04:23.897 --> 04:26.466
But this whole competition
was hard as hell,

04:26.466 --> 04:30.003
and I'm still here,
so bring it on.

04:30.003 --> 04:32.572
Well, bitch, this is top four!

04:32.572 --> 04:35.375
I cannot believe this,
I am so happy.

04:35.375 --> 04:37.010
Yay...

04:37.010 --> 04:39.045
We--

04:39.045 --> 04:41.281
-Yay!
[all laugh]

04:41.281 --> 04:42.949
-Congratulations, girl.
-Thank you.

04:42.949 --> 04:45.452
-This is 20,000? Word, bitch.
-Yeah, that's what I won.

04:45.452 --> 04:47.787
But your fourth time
in the top two.

04:47.787 --> 04:49.790
[Trinity] Yeah. I've proven
that I do deserve this.

04:49.790 --> 04:51.525
But it hasn't been easy

04:51.525 --> 04:54.161
and y'all make me nervous

04:54.161 --> 04:58.265
because everybody that's left
is fucking talented.

04:58.265 --> 05:00.534
Question, though.
I think I know,

05:00.534 --> 05:04.037
but just in case,
can I see your lipstick?

05:04.037 --> 05:06.039
I would prefer not to show.

05:06.039 --> 05:08.675
Bitch, you better show
that motherfucking lipstick.

05:08.675 --> 05:10.010
I don't want
to hurt her feelings.

05:12.145 --> 05:15.248
Monét, I don't want
to do this to you right now

05:15.248 --> 05:17.517
on national television,
so we should not.

05:18.618 --> 05:20.720
[sighs]

05:20.720 --> 05:23.223
I love you, but I told you

05:23.223 --> 05:25.592
you didn't do it for me
in the challenge,

05:25.592 --> 05:27.294
so I chose you.

05:27.294 --> 05:29.896
[laughs]
-Girl! Oh!

05:29.896 --> 05:31.431
Y'all love this goop shit.

05:31.431 --> 05:33.934
[Monét] I was really going,
thinking like--

05:33.934 --> 05:35.202
You said
you was not gonna be mad.

05:35.202 --> 05:36.670
Well, that was a lie.

05:36.670 --> 05:38.305
[all laugh]

05:38.305 --> 05:40.807
Bitch, I was about
to flip tables.

05:40.807 --> 05:42.108
This is
the bad girls club, girl.

05:42.108 --> 05:43.677
We would have had a moment.

05:43.677 --> 05:46.346
[laughs] No.

05:46.346 --> 05:48.515
I think some twist is coming.

05:48.515 --> 05:52.852
I don't know what,
but, bitch, it ain't over.

05:52.852 --> 05:56.556
Girl, what if it is something
like last season,

05:56.556 --> 05:58.024
which would be a gag?

05:58.024 --> 05:59.426
Where they brought
all the girls back,

05:59.426 --> 06:01.761
and they were, like, well,
we don't like you,

06:01.761 --> 06:03.096
so you're not making the top.

06:03.096 --> 06:04.731
Girl.

06:04.731 --> 06:07.867
Our track record
got us to this point,

06:07.867 --> 06:11.871
but I guarantee you
it's anyone's game.

06:11.871 --> 06:16.543
I know that everyone has dreamt
of taking home the crown.

06:16.543 --> 06:20.880
We've all worked so hard,

06:20.880 --> 06:23.717
and for one of us,
it's gonna pay off.

06:23.717 --> 06:27.120
So I have to prove
that I am the only choice

06:27.120 --> 06:28.288
for this title.

06:28.288 --> 06:31.358
I am the only choice
to win this.

06:31.358 --> 06:32.859
Or just poison them all.

06:34.894 --> 06:36.529
Aah!

Oh, it's a gag.

07:10.930 --> 07:13.133
Top four, bitch, yes!

07:13.133 --> 07:14.901
[Naomi] It's top four.

07:14.901 --> 07:18.271
I can just see the crown
in the distance

07:18.271 --> 07:19.506
and thank God,

07:19.506 --> 07:22.042
because I don't know
how much more I can tuck.

07:22.042 --> 07:23.410
Honestly.

07:25.712 --> 07:27.113
-Again.
-Oh!

07:27.113 --> 07:28.581
Was she trying
to make it twerk

07:28.581 --> 07:30.317
and because it's silicone
it didn't move?

07:30.317 --> 07:32.519
I'm gonna have
a fucking bruise.

07:32.519 --> 07:34.387
Do you know how many people
would love to be spanked

07:34.387 --> 07:35.989

07:35.989 --> 07:38.158

08:17.297 --> 08:18.565
-Amazing!
[cheers and applause]

08:18.565 --> 08:20.867
[RuPaul] This is it,

08:20.867 --> 08:23.470
your last chance to prove
that you deserve

08:23.470 --> 08:27.474
to sashay your way
into the Drag Race Hall of Fame.

08:27.474 --> 08:29.442
It's mine.

08:29.442 --> 08:33.446
And to take your rightful place

08:38.151 --> 08:40.453
Yes! I can't wait!

08:40.453 --> 08:43.623
But first,
you've got to earn it.

08:43.623 --> 08:45.091
[laughs]

08:45.091 --> 08:47.694
Now, for this week's
final maxi challenge,

08:47.694 --> 08:52.565
you'll be dancing and singing
to my new single...

08:52.565 --> 08:53.700
Super Queen.

08:53.700 --> 08:55.035
[Monét] All right.

08:55.035 --> 08:56.803
Super Queen, henny.

08:56.803 --> 08:59.038
First you'll compose
and record

08:59.038 --> 09:03.877
a solo verse that expresses
your Super Queen superpowers.

09:03.877 --> 09:05.345
Power of the pussy.

09:05.345 --> 09:08.114
Then the super-talented
Todrick Hall

09:08.114 --> 09:11.818
will teach you
super-sickening choreography.

09:11.818 --> 09:15.021
Later today, you'll be joining

09:15.021 --> 09:18.425

09:18.425 --> 09:21.394

[Monique] Oh!

09:26.366 --> 09:28.802
the top two All Stars
of the week

09:28.802 --> 09:31.204
will lip sync for the win.

09:31.204 --> 09:33.206
Girl.

09:33.206 --> 09:35.608
Yes, honey,
this shit done just got real.

09:35.608 --> 09:38.378
-Girl.
-[laughs]

09:38.378 --> 09:41.247
Ladies and gentlemen,
start your engines,

09:41.247 --> 09:43.783
and may the best All Star win.

09:43.783 --> 09:46.786
-Thank you, Ru.
-Oh, my God.

09:49.189 --> 09:50.557
What do you want
your powers to be about?

09:50.557 --> 09:54.294
I think I wanna talk about
like having superpowers,

09:54.294 --> 09:56.696
but also tying it in
to the game, too.

09:56.696 --> 09:57.964
You know what I mean?
Which is really fierce.

09:57.964 --> 10:00.233
-Right.
-What?

10:00.233 --> 10:03.770
I think that these queens
should be worried, you know.

10:03.770 --> 10:05.772
I can dance, I can sing,

10:05.772 --> 10:07.140
and I'm a good lyricist, girl.

10:07.140 --> 10:08.274
I have a song on iTunes

10:08.274 --> 10:10.810
that has over a million hits,
girl.

10:10.810 --> 10:13.113
I'm a superstar queen.

10:13.113 --> 10:14.380
-How do you feel?
[Monique] I just want this.

10:14.380 --> 10:16.616
I wanna be top two.
[Monét] Girl.

10:16.616 --> 10:17.684
I would love it
if it was us two.

10:17.684 --> 10:19.919
If I would live...

10:19.919 --> 10:21.754
I feel like
for one of us to win,

10:21.754 --> 10:23.089
it would be like
you didn't see us coming.

10:23.089 --> 10:24.123
You know what I mean?

10:24.123 --> 10:25.892
And we showed the fuck out.

10:25.892 --> 10:29.496
Monique and I
have been so underestimated

10:29.496 --> 10:33.500
this entire season because
we're so fresh from Season 10.

10:33.500 --> 10:36.970
But we were able to come
back in and do this immediately

10:36.970 --> 10:38.838
and really slay
this competition.

10:38.838 --> 10:40.940
Girl, that would just be
such a moment.

10:40.940 --> 10:42.242
[Monét] It would be a moment.
-And it would just speak

10:42.242 --> 10:47.680
to like the generations
of young black gay men.

10:47.680 --> 10:49.115
-It would just be very special
[Monique] It would be.

10:49.115 --> 10:50.583
To be in the top two with you.

10:50.583 --> 10:52.252
Dear Lord, please
let it be us together.

10:52.252 --> 10:53.419
[Monét] In Jesus's name.

10:53.419 --> 10:54.320
-Highly melanated.
-Highly melanated.

10:54.320 --> 10:55.622
Can you imagine?

10:55.622 --> 10:57.257
-[Monét] I would live.
-Like I would live.

10:58.625 --> 11:01.528
This is the last challenge.

11:01.528 --> 11:02.629
I know.

11:02.629 --> 11:04.631
How are you feeling
about this?

11:04.631 --> 11:06.599
I gonna put
my personality into it

11:06.599 --> 11:09.269
and have like a kind of
comedic edge on it

11:09.269 --> 11:12.071
and talk about all the things
I love about myself,

11:12.071 --> 11:14.307
because I think
that's what makes me so super.

11:14.307 --> 11:16.876
Yeah. On Season 9,
when I got this far

11:16.876 --> 11:19.379
and I had to write lyrics
for "Category Is,"

11:19.379 --> 11:23.182
girl, the fan base
hated my lyrics.

11:23.182 --> 11:25.585
Like I'm like known
as that queen

11:25.585 --> 11:28.254
who can't write song lyrics.

11:28.254 --> 11:31.324
But the thing that I'm nervous
about with this challenge

11:31.324 --> 11:32.292
is the choreography.

11:32.292 --> 11:33.993
Yes, I dance in my shows,

11:33.993 --> 11:35.628
but that's not choreography.

11:35.628 --> 11:37.764
There's a huge difference
between dancing

11:37.764 --> 11:40.733
and having to remember
very difficult choreography.

11:40.733 --> 11:42.468
The thing that worries me

11:42.468 --> 11:44.170
is like how much time
are we gonna have

11:44.170 --> 11:46.606
to really perfect
the choreography?

11:46.606 --> 11:49.909
And you know like this is gonna
be harder than our normal season

11:49.909 --> 11:51.144
'cause it's All Stars.

11:51.144 --> 11:53.780
Totally. Trinity
takes every single challenge

11:53.780 --> 11:55.882
and makes it her bitch.

11:55.882 --> 12:01.154
But this is our last chance
to impress Ru,

12:01.154 --> 12:05.858
and nerves are getting to her
and, girl, she's cracking.

12:05.858 --> 12:07.060
[laughs]

12:07.060 --> 12:08.895
I don't want to get
all the way to the end

12:08.895 --> 12:10.597
and then just crash and burn.

12:13.266 --> 12:14.300
Yep.

12:15.368 --> 12:18.037
Well, well, well.

12:18.037 --> 12:20.073
Here are my top four ladies.

12:20.073 --> 12:21.608
-Good to see y'all.
-Good to see you.

12:21.608 --> 12:23.576
-Hi, boys.
-Hi.

12:23.576 --> 12:25.545
[Monique] It's the very last
challenge.

12:25.545 --> 12:27.380
We have to learn choreography

12:27.380 --> 12:29.949
taught to us
by the lovely Todrick Hall,

12:29.949 --> 12:31.250
and then perform it.

12:31.250 --> 12:32.685
Tomorrow.

12:32.685 --> 12:34.721
Thank you!

12:34.721 --> 12:37.757
So today we're gonna be
doing Super Queen,

12:37.757 --> 12:40.326
and I want the choreography
to be so badass,

12:40.326 --> 12:42.629
I want it to be like
you're defeating villains

12:42.629 --> 12:44.030
and thotty boys.

12:44.030 --> 12:46.132
I want everybody
to be willing to try

12:46.132 --> 12:47.934
to do anything
that we put on your plate.

12:47.934 --> 12:49.235
Amen.

12:49.235 --> 12:50.737
Is there anybody here
who doesn't feel comfortable

12:50.737 --> 12:52.438
in the choreography department?

12:52.438 --> 12:54.674
I mean, I'm gonna be honest.
This is not my strong suit.

12:54.674 --> 12:56.275
I'm here to work hard.

12:56.275 --> 12:58.778
I will do to the best
of my ability.

12:58.778 --> 13:04.484
I'm not limber, so no splits
or leg liftings.

13:04.484 --> 13:05.918
I mean, damn, anything else?

13:05.918 --> 13:07.153
[all laugh]

13:07.153 --> 13:08.454
-I mean, can I have--
-What can you do?

13:08.454 --> 13:09.489
[all laugh]

13:09.489 --> 13:11.557
Can I have a stunt double,
bitch?

13:11.557 --> 13:14.427
Roll you around, bitch,
on a stretcher.

13:14.427 --> 13:16.429
Todrick expects
a lot out of you.

13:16.429 --> 13:19.966
He is not there for excuses.
He just wants results.

13:19.966 --> 13:24.337
And if I fuck this up,
it is over.

13:24.337 --> 13:26.039
In the beginning,
you're going to go

13:26.039 --> 13:30.043
"She's a Super Queen."

13:30.043 --> 13:31.678
And it should feel
like a big force,

13:31.678 --> 13:34.247
like pushes everybody that's
on this side to the ground.

13:34.247 --> 13:36.783
Five, six and seven and eight.

13:36.783 --> 13:39.485
She's a Super Queen.

13:39.485 --> 13:42.121
Five, six and seven and eight.

13:42.121 --> 13:43.623
Can I see y'all
do that together?

13:43.623 --> 13:46.025
Are you--you're walking first
with the right or the left?

13:46.025 --> 13:47.460
-Right.
-Right. Okay.

13:47.460 --> 13:49.429
Make sure that this
is a crown, not an earring.

13:49.429 --> 13:52.131
So make sure it's like
on top of your head, okay?

13:52.131 --> 13:53.666
You're trying
to win a crown here.

13:53.666 --> 13:56.135
This song has such a vibe to it,

13:56.135 --> 13:57.437
so I need there to be
precision,

13:57.437 --> 14:00.473
but the precision has to be
executed with swag.

14:00.473 --> 14:03.976
If they don't deliver it well,
it's just going to be a mess.

14:03.976 --> 14:06.813
Yeah.

14:06.813 --> 14:09.716
On this part, just to be
clear-- Naomi, you listening?

14:09.716 --> 14:12.151
Don't let Miss Walker
get you in trouble.

14:12.151 --> 14:13.486
Seven, eight.

14:13.486 --> 14:16.022
Girl, I love to pull trade
just as much as the next bitch,

14:16.022 --> 14:19.959
but the competition
is at stake here. Focus.

14:19.959 --> 14:22.829
And one, two, three, four.

14:22.829 --> 14:26.399
And five, six,
seven and eight. Naomi.

14:26.399 --> 14:27.600
[Naomi laughs]

14:27.600 --> 14:31.003
She was messy. [laughs]

14:31.003 --> 14:33.039
Don't let the boys
distract you.

14:33.039 --> 14:35.742
I'm just saying, in my
experience of being on the show,

14:35.742 --> 14:38.478
the people who are not
taking it seriously don't win.

14:38.478 --> 14:42.181
Yes, I need to stay focused
and get into this,

14:42.181 --> 14:45.218
'cause there is a lot
on the line. But...

14:45.218 --> 14:46.652
Girl, take it easy.

14:46.652 --> 14:48.454
None of us
have had sex in forever.

14:48.454 --> 14:49.956
[laughs]

14:49.956 --> 14:51.224
Can I just see you guys--

14:51.224 --> 14:52.925
we're going to try to do
this cartwheel thing

14:52.925 --> 14:53.960
before we move on.

14:53.960 --> 14:55.495
[all laugh]
-Yes.

14:55.495 --> 14:57.430
[Monique] We all remember
the infamous cartwheel

14:57.430 --> 14:59.265
from Season 10.

14:59.265 --> 15:02.368
♪ Horrible! ♪

15:05.905 --> 15:07.673
Yeah, girl,
I don't know about this,

15:07.673 --> 15:08.875
but we gonna try.

15:08.875 --> 15:11.177
Three, two, one, here I go.

15:11.177 --> 15:12.345
Uh!

15:12.345 --> 15:14.647
-Okay.
-That was good.

15:14.647 --> 15:17.583
I liked it.
That was pretty gaggy.

15:17.583 --> 15:20.887
Okay. One, two, three, and...

15:20.887 --> 15:22.822
-Yes.
-Oh, that was great.

15:22.822 --> 15:25.024
-Good job, Naomi.
-Look at you.

15:25.024 --> 15:26.392
[applause]

15:26.392 --> 15:29.629
All that talking and bonding
worked out after all.

15:29.629 --> 15:31.631
I've never done a cartwheel,
successfully.

15:31.631 --> 15:33.065
-In your life?
[Trinity] Successfully, no.

15:36.769 --> 15:38.905
-Yes!
-I just broke a nail.

15:38.905 --> 15:41.040
But you did it.
That's great.

15:41.040 --> 15:42.909
Okay, I'm seeing spots.
Is that normal?

15:42.909 --> 15:44.110
[Todrick] Yeah.
-Okay.

15:44.110 --> 15:45.678
-Are you ready?
[Monique] I'm gonna try it.

15:45.678 --> 15:47.914
[laughs]

15:51.818 --> 15:52.852
-It's scary, right?
-Yeah.

15:52.852 --> 15:55.087
-It's real scary.
[all laugh]

15:56.689 --> 15:58.357
I cannot do it.

15:58.357 --> 16:00.760
I'm gonna go left. I'm gonna
go left. I'm gonna go left.

16:02.662 --> 16:04.964
[laughs]

16:04.964 --> 16:07.700
[Monét] Bitch.

16:07.700 --> 16:09.735
I don't know
where to put this arm.

16:09.735 --> 16:11.404
I really don't.
Please don't go this way,

16:11.404 --> 16:12.638
because
I really can't go that way.

16:15.408 --> 16:16.976
[laughs]

16:16.976 --> 16:20.246
Take out the cartwheel.
I am going to break my hip.

16:20.246 --> 16:23.049
Monique looks petrified, girl.
Just take it out.

16:23.049 --> 16:24.250
What is happening?

16:26.118 --> 16:27.820
I don't--this--

16:27.820 --> 16:29.689
It's not gonna happen.

16:29.689 --> 16:32.024
You three ladies
can sit over here.

16:32.024 --> 16:36.295
Okay, so your lyrics are,
"she's enticing, mesmerizing,"

16:36.295 --> 16:38.331
so you're gonna go, and four,

16:38.331 --> 16:40.900
♪ She's enticing, mesmerizing ♪

16:40.900 --> 16:43.636
Da-da-da-da, boom, boom.

16:43.636 --> 16:46.172
♪ She's enticing, mesmerizing ♪

16:46.172 --> 16:48.741
[Monique] I don't necessarily
learn choreography fast

16:48.741 --> 16:49.775
in the moment,

16:49.775 --> 16:52.078
but turn them stage lights on.

16:52.078 --> 16:54.013
She's there!

16:54.013 --> 16:55.815
♪ Are you ready, Trinity? ♪

16:55.815 --> 16:57.984
You're gonna go step left,

16:57.984 --> 17:00.119
and each time, you're gonna go,
boomp, boomp,

17:00.119 --> 17:01.754
boomp, boomp, boomp, boomp.

17:01.754 --> 17:05.057
One and two and three
and four.

17:05.057 --> 17:06.526
And that's your lyrics.

17:06.526 --> 17:08.928
"She walks the fashion
when she hits the floor."

17:08.928 --> 17:11.430
Cute. Okay.
Well, see if I can I get it.

17:11.430 --> 17:13.933
And one, two, three, four.

17:13.933 --> 17:15.201
Okay, I'm already lost.

17:15.201 --> 17:17.136
She walks the fashion
when she hits the floor.

17:17.136 --> 17:18.571
-Okay.
-Okay?

17:18.571 --> 17:21.040
I'm lost, but the--
it goes one, two, three, four.

17:21.040 --> 17:22.975
I've got--okay.

17:22.975 --> 17:25.444
[all laugh]
-You got it, bitch.

17:25.444 --> 17:30.216
Poor Trinity The Tuck can't even
get her body to do the motion.

17:30.216 --> 17:33.252
She looks a mess.
It's just a no, girl.

17:33.252 --> 17:34.654
I think that
your rap is really dope,

17:34.654 --> 17:35.955
but you have to be able
to do this choreography

17:35.955 --> 17:37.256
while doing all the steps.

17:37.256 --> 17:39.458
-To match this, yes.
-And I say that you maybe have

17:39.458 --> 17:41.260
like the most intricate
choreography.

17:41.260 --> 17:43.262
-Oh, thanks.
-Well, you wrote the lyrics,

17:43.262 --> 17:44.897
and I just had to
bring it to life, you know.

17:44.897 --> 17:46.832
-You're right.
-Let's do it with confidence.

17:46.832 --> 17:49.368
I'm confident that
I'm gonna mess this up.

17:49.368 --> 17:52.638
[laughs] Okay.

17:52.638 --> 17:53.806
The lyrics that she writes

17:53.806 --> 17:56.375
make my brain want to do
intricate things.

17:56.375 --> 17:58.311
But I'm concerned, because
Trinity is in her head.

17:58.311 --> 18:02.515
She is just like so paranoid
when it comes to choreography.

18:02.515 --> 18:04.250
-It's really cute.
-It's really cute.

18:04.250 --> 18:06.485
If you could do her.

18:06.485 --> 18:08.821
-If I can--
-If you and her meet somewhere.

18:08.821 --> 18:10.856
It's a lot to process
'cause it's so fast.

18:10.856 --> 18:12.692
-Mm-hmm.
-But I will get it.

18:12.692 --> 18:15.294
Naomi.
Now, are you flexible?

18:15.294 --> 18:16.395
Because it's talking
about stretching

18:16.395 --> 18:18.297
and all that stuff
in your lyrics.

18:18.297 --> 18:20.099
-Um, I'm pretty flexible.
-Okay.

18:20.099 --> 18:22.101
You start out with legs up.

18:22.101 --> 18:23.302
So maybe we should
just try to see

18:23.302 --> 18:25.104
if there's a lift
that we can do with you

18:25.104 --> 18:26.205
to like get your legs
up in the air.

18:26.205 --> 18:27.206
Okay.

18:27.206 --> 18:29.608
One, two, down, up.

18:29.608 --> 18:32.078
-Okay.
[Trinity] Oh.

18:32.078 --> 18:33.479
Oh, this is hot.

18:33.479 --> 18:35.848
Boys, now you stop this way,

18:35.848 --> 18:37.016
and you're going
to open your legs.

18:37.016 --> 18:40.286
Okay, I want a lift as well.
Oh, my God.

18:40.286 --> 18:44.657
Naomi is being lifted up in
the air by four beautiful men.

18:44.657 --> 18:47.026
She's living her best fantasy.

18:47.026 --> 18:49.428
If I was 100 pounds lighter,
I'd want that choreo, too.

18:49.428 --> 18:51.163
[laughs]

18:51.163 --> 18:52.264
I'm going to start with

18:52.264 --> 18:54.066
"She's popping, she's dipping,

18:54.066 --> 18:55.167
she's spinning rock star."

18:55.167 --> 18:56.335
So go, boom,

18:56.335 --> 18:59.171
♪ She's popping,
She's dipping ♪

18:59.171 --> 19:00.706
Then you're gonna step
with your right leg, boom.

19:00.706 --> 19:03.609
She's winning, rock star.

19:03.609 --> 19:05.378
Eight, and boomp,
♪ She's popping ♪

19:05.378 --> 19:08.748
♪ She's spinning,
she's winning, rock star ♪

19:08.748 --> 19:10.983
-Great.
-That was good.

19:10.983 --> 19:12.151
Yes, Monét.

19:12.151 --> 19:15.321
Monét picked up
on this choreo like that.

19:15.321 --> 19:16.722
She looks like a star.

19:16.722 --> 19:24.964
Girl, this day has wrecked
my motherfucking nerves.

19:24.964 --> 19:26.165
Help me.

19:26.165 --> 19:27.767
There is a lot to learn.

19:27.767 --> 19:31.337
I feel a little worried
for some of you.

19:31.337 --> 19:32.505
Practice, practice,
practice all night.

19:32.505 --> 19:34.440
-Okay?
-All night.

19:34.440 --> 19:35.441
All right, good luck,
super queens.

19:35.441 --> 19:36.709
-Bye.
-Bye.

19:36.709 --> 19:37.710
[Todrick] See you tomorrow.

19:41.013 --> 19:42.448
This is so crazy.

19:42.448 --> 19:45.451
-Hi, Monét.
-Hello, Ru and Michelle.

19:45.451 --> 19:49.021
Oh, bitch,
full circle moment, honey.

19:49.021 --> 19:51.657
My season, I didn't get
to do a podcast with Ru,

19:51.657 --> 19:54.193
so I am excited, I'm elated.

19:54.193 --> 19:56.762
Girl, What's the Tee, bitch?

19:56.762 --> 19:59.465
-The sponge has landed.
[Monét laughs]

19:59.465 --> 20:00.566
I did it just for Michelle.

20:00.566 --> 20:02.034
I hope you mop up
the competition.

20:02.034 --> 20:03.669
[all laugh]

20:04.770 --> 20:06.672
This is your first time
at the podcast.

20:06.672 --> 20:07.940
It is, Ru.

20:07.940 --> 20:10.076
Because you didn't make it
this far last time.

20:10.076 --> 20:12.044
I did not,
and I feel a lot of shame.

20:12.044 --> 20:15.247
Season 10, I left with my tail
between my legs, you know.

20:15.247 --> 20:16.649
You didn't need to do that,
though.

20:16.649 --> 20:18.017
-You did a good job.
-You didn't need to do that.

20:18.017 --> 20:20.086
You were loved,
you were Miss Congeniality.

20:20.086 --> 20:21.320
[Monét] Yeah. I think
the shame for me

20:21.320 --> 20:24.256
came with New York City
has always exemplified,

20:24.256 --> 20:26.225
like, perfection
in this competition.

20:26.225 --> 20:29.028
Bianca, Bob, Sasha,
girls who really like

20:29.028 --> 20:31.363
just personify, like,
that fierce New York grit,

20:31.363 --> 20:33.999
but also like just
talent out the wazoo.

20:33.999 --> 20:36.402
And, you know,
toward the end of my season,

20:36.402 --> 20:37.937
I was turning out challenges,

20:37.937 --> 20:41.207
but on the runway, just letting
myself and y'all down a lot.

20:41.207 --> 20:42.408
So coming back to All Stars,

20:42.408 --> 20:44.376
I was like, I want
to show Ru and Michelle

20:44.376 --> 20:46.445
that I can wear nice clothes.

20:46.445 --> 20:47.680
So that was like my main goal,

20:47.680 --> 20:50.382
but also, really do well
in the challenges as well.

20:50.382 --> 20:52.151
So the expectation
that I had for myself

20:52.151 --> 20:54.019
was to really, like,
go above and beyond

20:54.019 --> 20:55.588
what I did on my season,
you know.

20:55.588 --> 20:59.492
Just knowing that you guys are
seeing that Monét is that bitch.

20:59.492 --> 21:01.927
Now, beyond this competition,

21:01.927 --> 21:04.163
what do you see
Monét X Change doing?

21:04.163 --> 21:05.798
What's on the horizon?

21:05.798 --> 21:07.032
After this, I go to Australia,

21:07.032 --> 21:09.702
and then I'm traveling
my one-woman show,

21:09.702 --> 21:12.104
Call Me By Monét.

21:12.104 --> 21:13.706
-Call Me By Monét?
[Monét] Call Me By Monét.

21:13.706 --> 21:16.475
I love that.
That's brilliant.

21:16.475 --> 21:18.043
Is there a peach
in your one-woman show?

21:18.043 --> 21:19.712
Oh, Ru, you know
I had to do it.

21:19.712 --> 21:22.715
-Oh, yes.
[all laugh]

21:22.715 --> 21:23.816
Get your ticket.

21:23.816 --> 21:25.317
I'm gonna give y'all
a complimentary.

21:25.317 --> 21:26.619
-Y'all gonna come?
-Drink tickets included?

21:26.619 --> 21:29.722
Only for y'all.
Nobody else. I swear.

21:29.722 --> 21:32.558
Well, Monét,
you are a fabulous queen.

21:32.558 --> 21:35.461
I'm so glad
you got to come back

21:35.461 --> 21:37.563
and show the world
what you are made of,

21:37.563 --> 21:39.398
and you did just that.

21:39.398 --> 21:40.766
Thank you, Ru.

21:40.766 --> 21:43.402
-Hi, Monique Heart.
-Hello, hello.

21:43.402 --> 21:44.603
Welcome to What's the Tee?

21:44.603 --> 21:46.005
How are you?

21:46.005 --> 21:47.573
Tell me,
how has this experience

21:47.573 --> 21:49.775
been different from your season?

21:49.775 --> 21:52.478
-I'm winning.
[all laugh]

21:52.478 --> 21:53.846
I'm top four.

21:53.846 --> 21:57.016
Coming in, I knew
that I had to deliver,

21:57.016 --> 22:01.887
because last time, I did not
get to show the world

22:01.887 --> 22:03.522
the fullness of what's here.

22:03.522 --> 22:05.791
Did you get to do everything
you wanted to do?

22:05.791 --> 22:07.026
For the most part.

22:07.026 --> 22:09.261
But the roast,
I really wanted that one.

22:09.261 --> 22:10.863
I think
I could have been in the top

22:10.863 --> 22:13.065
had I slowed the cadence

22:13.065 --> 22:15.134
of the rhythm
of the preacher thing down.

22:15.134 --> 22:16.302
Yes.

22:16.302 --> 22:17.970
But you know, hey,

22:17.970 --> 22:19.104
that's a character
I can take on the road.

22:19.104 --> 22:20.506
So I'm gonna make
some money with her.

22:20.506 --> 22:22.942
Yeah, well, the preaching
thing is in your wheelhouse.

22:22.942 --> 22:24.310
[Michelle] Yeah.
-It really, really is.

22:24.310 --> 22:25.678
You went to seminary school.

22:25.678 --> 22:28.380
I did, and led
the ex-gay ministry,

22:28.380 --> 22:30.282
helped other men
pray their gay away.

22:30.282 --> 22:31.684
You led the ex-gay ministry.

22:31.684 --> 22:32.985
-Led it.
-Wow.

22:32.985 --> 22:35.020
I wanted to have 12 kids

22:35.020 --> 22:36.555
and get married to a woman.

22:36.555 --> 22:38.691
-And I was a lot heavier then.
-Oh.

22:38.691 --> 22:40.025
So, yeah, I was 300 pounds.

22:40.025 --> 22:42.528
Wait, no, stop, wait a minute.
Stop the tape.

22:42.528 --> 22:43.862
We want answers.

22:43.862 --> 22:45.831
[RuPaul]
You in that skinny frame

22:45.831 --> 22:47.433
-were 300 pounds?
-300 pounds.

22:47.433 --> 22:49.368
[Michelle] Because
you weren't happy?

22:49.368 --> 22:51.904
[Monique] I wasn't happy.
I ate my feelings.

22:51.904 --> 22:53.239
But I dropped it.

22:53.239 --> 22:55.574
Did crossfit,
and I started eating healthy.

22:55.574 --> 22:59.612
And when I saw my body coming
through, I began to love me.

22:59.612 --> 23:01.513
So I came out in March,

23:01.513 --> 23:04.850
I started drag that following
October, hosting my own shows.

23:04.850 --> 23:07.720
Wow. You know,
there's so much to your story

23:07.720 --> 23:10.322
that can help people out there.
[Michelle] Unbelievable.

23:10.322 --> 23:12.491
And it's your job
to tell your story.

23:12.491 --> 23:15.794
Thank you so much for being
on the podcast, my love.

23:15.794 --> 23:17.496
[RuPaul] And good luck.
-Yeah!

23:17.496 --> 23:21.033
Naomi. I say Nay-omi,
you say Nie-omi.

23:21.033 --> 23:22.301
Let's call the whole thing off.

23:22.301 --> 23:24.370
You can call me
whatever you want to call me.

23:24.370 --> 23:25.537
-Nice. Nice.
-Nice.

23:25.537 --> 23:27.039
-As long as you call me.
[RuPaul] Yes.

23:27.039 --> 23:29.008
You look really gorgeous
and young.

23:29.008 --> 23:30.709
-Oh, thank you.
[RuPaul] Because you're 24?

23:30.709 --> 23:31.844
I am 24.

23:31.844 --> 23:33.078
And how old were you

23:33.078 --> 23:35.514
when you first entered
this competition?

23:35.514 --> 23:36.749
I was 21.

23:36.749 --> 23:38.017
[RuPaul] 21 years old.
[Naomi] Yeah.

23:38.017 --> 23:39.184
I thought I knew
everything about drag.

23:39.184 --> 23:41.754
And you can grow
so much in three years.

23:41.754 --> 23:44.423
So in the time you've
been here on All Stars 4,

23:44.423 --> 23:46.125
what have you learned
about yourself?

23:46.125 --> 23:48.360
Um, I think that
last week's critiques

23:48.360 --> 23:52.197
about me not being like
relatable and likable--

23:52.197 --> 23:55.134
What was missing for me
from your performance

23:55.134 --> 23:56.835
was any likability.

23:58.003 --> 23:59.405
That was as a character,
darling.

23:59.405 --> 24:01.974
-That was as that character.
-That wasn't as a person.

24:01.974 --> 24:04.476
No, but I feel like I've had
it, just, like, in the roast,

24:04.476 --> 24:06.378
like, if you can't relate
with me,

24:06.378 --> 24:09.181
it's not necessarily
something you can find humor in.

24:09.181 --> 24:11.583
I think there's a lot in Naomi

24:11.583 --> 24:14.086
that wants to be
on the cover of Vogue,

24:14.086 --> 24:17.256
and wants to be fierce
and wants to be like...

24:17.256 --> 24:21.327
[Michelle] Yes!
[all laugh]

24:21.327 --> 24:22.928
You're right.

24:22.928 --> 24:24.797
When this is happening,
the wall is up.

24:24.797 --> 24:28.133
So I think the focus
on just being fierce

24:28.133 --> 24:30.235
takes away your relatability.

24:30.235 --> 24:32.171
I don't want it to come across

24:32.171 --> 24:34.306
like fierceness
is the only thing I care about.

24:34.306 --> 24:36.942
I am a drag queen first,
and I just love fashion.

24:36.942 --> 24:38.644
I'm curious
what you guys thought

24:38.644 --> 24:40.579
of the Judy Garland lip sync.

24:40.579 --> 24:42.448
Oh, my God, that was so good.

24:42.448 --> 24:46.151
I loved it. That's what you
should have been doing as SJP.

24:46.151 --> 24:48.721
You don't have to try to be...

24:48.721 --> 24:50.756
[Michelle] You are that thing.
[RuPaul] You are that thing.

24:50.756 --> 24:53.225
Now, give us the other thing,
the yin, the yang,

24:53.225 --> 24:54.493
the Sonny, the Cher.

24:54.493 --> 24:56.695
-Yes.
[RuPaul] All of it.

24:56.695 --> 24:58.931
Thank you so much,
and good luck.

25:00.332 --> 25:02.368
-Hi, Trinity.
-Well, look who's here.

25:02.368 --> 25:05.637
Look what the cat dragged in.
And by drag, I mean Trinity.

25:05.637 --> 25:07.272
-Yes.
-Hi.

25:07.272 --> 25:11.510
So how different
is All Stars from Season 9?

25:11.510 --> 25:15.314
Oh, girl, this is
a whole different ballgame.

25:15.314 --> 25:17.149
-This is a lot harder.
-Is it?

25:17.149 --> 25:19.518
The challenges are more
difficult, I feel like.

25:19.518 --> 25:23.822
And emotionally, this
has been a harder challenge.

25:23.822 --> 25:25.791
-Really?
-During Season 9,

25:25.791 --> 25:28.227
I had a lot of walls built up,

25:28.227 --> 25:31.530
and that kind of shielded me
from my emotions.

25:31.530 --> 25:35.801
Since Season 9, I really
have let my guard down some,

25:35.801 --> 25:39.571
and so when you allow yourself
to feel emotion,

25:39.571 --> 25:41.006
it makes things more personal.

25:41.006 --> 25:44.009
Did you approach this time
differently than Season 9?

25:44.009 --> 25:47.980
I wanted to surprise you guys
every single time you saw me.

25:47.980 --> 25:49.515
-And you did.
[Trinity] Thank you.

25:49.515 --> 25:52.384
There's something
really likeable about you.

25:52.384 --> 25:54.119
Star quality.
It really is star quality.

25:54.119 --> 25:55.854
Thank you.

25:59.525 --> 26:01.493
-Check your lips--
-What?

26:01.493 --> 26:03.662
-What?
-Oh, my God.

26:03.662 --> 26:06.465
-Huh?
[Monét] Who is that?

26:06.465 --> 26:08.634
Don't play any games.

26:09.635 --> 26:11.403
I'm done. This was cute.

26:11.403 --> 26:13.772
The records show
that I made top four.

26:13.772 --> 26:16.508
I'm out. Goodbye.

26:18.310 --> 26:22.181
[cheering]

26:22.181 --> 26:27.086
Ladies, we have a very
important announcement to make.

26:27.086 --> 26:31.757
All Star rules...
have been suspended.

26:34.326 --> 26:35.694
Permanently.

26:35.694 --> 26:37.496
[gasps]

26:37.496 --> 26:40.098
Lord, please let there
not be another twist.

26:40.098 --> 26:42.100
I can't. I can't.
I'm broken.

26:42.100 --> 26:45.604
We will be deciding
who wins All Stars.

26:45.604 --> 26:46.772
-No.
-Girl.

26:46.772 --> 26:47.773
[Monét] Girl.
[Naomi] Wild.

26:47.773 --> 26:49.808
-They are?
[Trinity] What?

26:49.808 --> 26:51.376
-I cannot.

26:51.376 --> 26:53.245
Somebody send me home right now.
I'm done.

26:53.245 --> 26:54.246
I'm ready to go.

26:54.246 --> 26:56.115
Get my suitcase.
I'm ready to pack.

26:58.584 --> 27:00.252
[evil laugh]

27:00.252 --> 27:02.955
We will be deciding
who wins All Stars.

27:02.955 --> 27:04.122
-No, girl.
-Girl.

27:04.122 --> 27:05.123
[Trinity] No.
[Naomi] Wild.

27:05.123 --> 27:07.092
-They are?
-What?

27:07.092 --> 27:08.961
[Monique] The three
Hall of Famers tell us

27:08.961 --> 27:11.563
that the All Star rules
are suspended.

27:11.563 --> 27:12.865
Again.

27:12.865 --> 27:14.733
Permanently this time.

27:14.733 --> 27:17.202
And they decide?

27:17.202 --> 27:20.973
I'll be damned if these bitches
who ain't been here,

27:20.973 --> 27:23.809
ain't seen shit
gonna tell me.

27:23.809 --> 27:25.410
I'm about to riot.

27:25.410 --> 27:27.446
[evil laugh]

27:30.649 --> 27:32.284
Just kidding.

27:32.284 --> 27:33.452
Ru still decides.

27:33.452 --> 27:35.254
-Oh, thank God.
-Yeah, girl.

27:35.254 --> 27:37.923
Yes, yes, yes, yes,
yes, yes, yes.

27:37.923 --> 27:40.859
Ru ain't letting no eliminated
girls come and make a decision.

27:40.859 --> 27:43.662
Ru is making the decision
for this All Star finale.

27:43.662 --> 27:46.198
The only rule
we're breaking today

27:46.198 --> 27:48.033
is we're bringing hard liquor
into the workroom

27:48.033 --> 27:49.868
before 10 A.M. Rreowr!

27:49.868 --> 27:50.869
[cheering]
-Yes!

27:50.869 --> 27:54.406
Shot, shot, shot, shot, shot.

27:54.406 --> 27:56.775
Yes!

27:56.775 --> 27:58.110
Hi, how are you?

27:58.110 --> 28:02.014
[all talking at once]

28:02.014 --> 28:03.181
How are you?

28:03.181 --> 28:05.717
[Trinity] How are you?

28:05.717 --> 28:07.085
First, can we just cheers?

28:07.085 --> 28:08.287
[All] Cheers.

28:08.287 --> 28:11.490
♪ All Stars ♪

28:12.891 --> 28:14.593
What's it like to win?

28:14.593 --> 28:16.461
-Oh, my gosh.
-[laughs]

28:16.461 --> 28:19.164
One of you guys is gonna
join us in the Hall of Fame.

28:19.164 --> 28:20.566
We want to be real,
What's the Tee?

28:20.566 --> 28:21.867
Well...

28:21.867 --> 28:23.202
Who has the most wins
right now?

28:23.202 --> 28:24.536
-Trin.
-Trin.

28:24.536 --> 28:26.104
-For the win.
-Girl.

28:26.104 --> 28:28.407
It's four, three, one.

28:29.608 --> 28:31.410
This is not a good feeling.

28:31.410 --> 28:34.713
Everyone's
comparing their dicks,

28:34.713 --> 28:36.682
and I'm the shortest one
in the room.

28:36.682 --> 28:38.450
And that never happens.

28:38.450 --> 28:39.585
All right, you guys,
good luck.

28:39.585 --> 28:40.686
-Thank you.
-Thank you so much.

28:40.686 --> 28:41.687
Wait, wait, wait.
I have a question.

28:41.687 --> 28:43.121
I have a question.

28:43.121 --> 28:44.957
Are y'all here for the whole
little runway and everything?

28:44.957 --> 28:47.693
All will be revealed.

28:47.693 --> 28:50.362
[all laugh]

28:50.362 --> 28:52.464
-Bye-ee.
-Bye.

28:52.464 --> 28:54.700
Seeing the three
Hall of Famers

28:54.700 --> 28:56.735
reminds me
of where I want to be,

28:56.735 --> 28:59.638
and it really snapped that
into focus for me.

28:59.638 --> 29:01.273
I'm like I want to be here
in All Stars 5

29:01.273 --> 29:03.075
talking to the next girl.

29:03.075 --> 29:04.943
Winning isn't everything,
but it's really cool.

29:04.943 --> 29:06.144
[all laugh]

29:06.144 --> 29:09.181
[Trinity] Team Katya.
[laughs]

29:11.483 --> 29:13.552
Are you ready
for the final challenge?

29:13.552 --> 29:15.687
Girl, it is so gaggy.

29:15.687 --> 29:17.990
Bitch, we've been rehearsing
all fucking night.

29:17.990 --> 29:19.524
I feel drained, I feel tired,

29:19.524 --> 29:21.126
but, bitch, this is what being

29:21.126 --> 29:24.930
a fucking top motherfucking four
feels like, bitch.

29:24.930 --> 29:26.698
There goes Miss Trinity.

29:26.698 --> 29:28.367
We're just talking.
We feel fucking exhausted.

29:28.367 --> 29:30.168
-How you feel?
-The same, girl.

29:30.168 --> 29:31.503
-Right?
-The same.

29:31.503 --> 29:32.571
But you know what?

29:32.571 --> 29:35.307
I gotta pull the inner energy

29:35.307 --> 29:38.677
from the fibers of my silicone.

29:38.677 --> 29:39.878
Yes, girl.

29:39.878 --> 29:41.713
Deep within the tuck.

29:41.713 --> 29:43.815
You definitely had
the best run-through.

29:43.815 --> 29:45.917
-You think so?
-Oh, for sure. 100%.

29:45.917 --> 29:47.419
I'm really nervous about mine.

29:47.419 --> 29:48.620
I haven't seen
the whole visual,

29:48.620 --> 29:50.555
but I know
what yours looks like.

29:50.555 --> 29:52.491
And yours, bitch,
you turn around,

29:52.491 --> 29:54.159
you swivel
in that fucking chair, bitch,

29:54.159 --> 29:56.328
like you are like
the bitch.

29:56.328 --> 29:57.696
It's just fucking sickening.

29:57.696 --> 30:00.732
I'm just like, bitch,
why couldn't that be me?

30:00.732 --> 30:03.368
-This is the last challenge.
-Yeah.

30:03.368 --> 30:06.371
-And I want this.
-Amen.

30:06.371 --> 30:08.106
[Naomi] It's not a factor
of who wants it the most.

30:08.106 --> 30:09.841
It's a factor
of who deserves it.

30:09.841 --> 30:13.945
Girl, I'm only one win ahead
of two people.

30:13.945 --> 30:15.113
Girl, that's nothing.

30:15.113 --> 30:16.148
-Yeah.
-That's nothing.

30:16.148 --> 30:17.282
That doesn't mean anything.

30:17.282 --> 30:18.550
Yeah, it doesn't
make or break someone.

30:18.550 --> 30:22.154
Exactly. You know,
we still have to do the number.

30:22.154 --> 30:25.023
We still have to present
our finale look.

30:25.023 --> 30:26.892
We still have to talk
to the judges.

30:26.892 --> 30:30.429
And so if I really
fuck up really bad,

30:30.429 --> 30:34.533
which, girl, I'm really
nervous about, then, yeah.

30:34.533 --> 30:37.235
There's a lot on the line,
but I hope it's a good sign

30:37.235 --> 30:39.671
that I'm more excited
than nervous.

30:39.671 --> 30:43.008
I know that I'm very proud
of what I presented here,

30:43.008 --> 30:44.509
and I think
that the judges can see

30:44.509 --> 30:48.213
how much more confident I am
this time around.

30:48.213 --> 30:49.581
And I'm so proud of that.

30:49.581 --> 30:52.484
[Monique] Going into
this last challenge,

30:52.484 --> 30:55.020
oh, like, dying.

30:55.020 --> 30:59.624
We're all having these damn
emotions, and we all want it,

30:59.624 --> 31:00.792
but there's only one person
that's gonna win.

31:11.169 --> 31:15.540
I'm so excited to do it,
but I am super tender, you know.

31:15.540 --> 31:17.209
You've worked so hard
and you're here

31:17.209 --> 31:19.244
and you're exhausted.

31:19.244 --> 31:23.381
Like you're trying
to still like pull the juice,

31:23.381 --> 31:26.017
and you're like, bitch,
she is gone.

31:26.017 --> 31:28.754
The competition is hard,
and it's emotionally draining.

31:28.754 --> 31:31.990
But I cannot allow
anything to break me,

31:31.990 --> 31:33.959
because I came here for a job:

31:33.959 --> 31:35.427
To get to the top and win.

31:35.427 --> 31:37.796
This is like the last time

31:37.796 --> 31:40.599
we're painting
for this competition.

31:40.599 --> 31:42.667
-Somebody is gonna win...
-Absolutely.

31:42.667 --> 31:44.336
[Trinity] And three people
are going home.

31:44.336 --> 31:47.005
So we have to, you know,
just do your best,

31:47.005 --> 31:50.909
because the battle's not over,
and the winner is not picked.

31:50.909 --> 31:51.910
Oh.

31:51.910 --> 31:53.512
[Trinity] So good luck to y'all.

31:53.512 --> 31:54.579
[Monét] Amen.

32:58.844 --> 33:00.779

to flex their superpowers
one last time

33:06.418 --> 33:11.623

For this All Star Eleganza,

37:27.112 --> 37:30.148

African silks can be.

37:30.148 --> 37:31.916

I feel expensive.

37:53.772 --> 37:54.873
I feel regal.

37:54.873 --> 37:56.875
I feel like
this is a good wig

37:56.875 --> 37:58.576
to have that crown put on.

37:58.576 --> 38:01.246
So...[clucks tongue]
she's ready.

38:01.246 --> 38:02.947
[Michelle]
I think the crop is ready.

38:02.947 --> 38:04.549
[Todrick] She's walking
in a crop circle.

38:04.549 --> 38:06.618
[all laugh]
-Aw, shucks.

38:06.618 --> 38:08.486
[all laugh]

38:08.486 --> 38:11.756
[Ross] What to wear
when your elbows are fat.

38:11.756 --> 38:13.658
[all laugh]

38:13.658 --> 38:16.227
[Michelle]
Guys, this could get meshy.

38:16.227 --> 38:17.996
[all laugh]

38:17.996 --> 38:19.464
[RuPaul] Ooh.

38:19.464 --> 38:21.432
[Ross] She skirted the issue.
[Michelle] She did.

38:21.432 --> 38:22.834
[laughs]

38:22.834 --> 38:26.137
[Naomi] This is Naomi Smalls
at her highest form.

38:26.137 --> 38:29.841
I am shining from head to toe.

38:29.841 --> 38:31.643
I am looking rich, bitch.

38:31.643 --> 38:34.145
I am looking opulent.

38:34.145 --> 38:36.481
I own everything.

38:36.481 --> 38:39.017
[RuPaul] Oh, she's gonna
take the train home.

38:39.017 --> 38:42.353
[all laugh]

38:42.353 --> 38:44.789
[Ross] That's a midnight train
to Georgia.

38:44.789 --> 38:46.824
[all laugh]

38:46.824 --> 38:49.761
[RuPaul]
Dress by Vivian Wedgwood.

38:49.761 --> 38:53.298
[Michelle] Wedgwood you
if you could?

38:53.298 --> 38:55.066
[all laugh]
[Ross] Oh!

38:55.066 --> 38:56.868
[Carson] Well, I thought
she was an A cup,

38:56.868 --> 38:59.504
but she's obviously a tea cup.

38:59.504 --> 39:03.508
[Trinity] Walking down
the runway for the final time,

39:03.508 --> 39:05.710
I feel stunning.

39:05.710 --> 39:09.113
My gown
is absolutely incredible,

39:09.113 --> 39:12.817
and I don't think I've
ever felt better in my life.

39:12.817 --> 39:14.586
You wanted some tea?
Well, you're in luck.

39:14.586 --> 39:16.855
'Cause tonight,
it's piping hot.

39:16.855 --> 39:18.489
[Michelle]
And there's her saucer.

39:18.489 --> 39:21.759
[Carson] Mm. Tea?
Party of two.

39:21.759 --> 39:24.229
[RuPaul]
She's using the good china.

39:25.363 --> 39:27.098
Welcome, All Stars.

39:27.098 --> 39:31.336
You've come a long way, babies.

39:31.336 --> 39:33.571
Now it's time for
the judges' final critiques,

39:33.571 --> 39:36.541
starting with Monét X Change.

39:36.541 --> 39:38.576
[Ross] Have you ever been
in a grocery store,

39:38.576 --> 39:40.778
and you want like a peach
and you bite into it

39:40.778 --> 39:42.880
and it's not quite ripe?

39:42.880 --> 39:46.284
That's how I felt about you
in your season.

39:46.284 --> 39:48.753
You just needed a little
more time to ripen up.

39:48.753 --> 39:50.255
Let me tell you, honey,
in All Stars,

39:50.255 --> 39:54.392
you are juicy and ripe
and dripping down all our chins.

39:54.392 --> 39:56.694
-Like, call me by your name?
-Yes.

39:56.694 --> 39:58.162
[laughs]

39:58.162 --> 40:01.299
[Michelle] In your season,
I fell in love with you,

40:01.299 --> 40:03.901
but you are so much more than
we got to see on your season.

40:03.901 --> 40:07.405
You've elevated your drag
in so many ways.

40:07.405 --> 40:10.475
Tonight, your performance,
I thought it was empowering

40:10.475 --> 40:13.144
and I thought that you nailed
your choreography

40:13.144 --> 40:16.781
and you did it with conviction,
and I loved watching it.

40:16.781 --> 40:18.750
I loved getting to hear
that beautiful,

40:18.750 --> 40:21.419
like, those brandy tones
come out of your voice.

40:21.419 --> 40:24.555
I had to grab Michelle's leg,
because I was just so excited.

40:24.555 --> 40:25.990
That wasn't her leg.

40:25.990 --> 40:28.426
[all laugh]

40:29.594 --> 40:30.728
[Carson]
Watching that performance,

40:30.728 --> 40:32.463
you were not thinking
about your lyrics,

40:32.463 --> 40:34.465
you were not thinking
about your dance moves.

40:34.465 --> 40:36.200
You were just in it to win it.

40:36.200 --> 40:39.137
And I think this look,
it has a point of view.

40:39.137 --> 40:41.372
It's beautiful.
The details are perfect.

40:41.372 --> 40:43.608
The makeup is perfect.
I love the nude lip.

40:43.608 --> 40:46.210
All of that together
tells us a story,

40:46.210 --> 40:47.779
and that's
what great fashion does.

40:47.779 --> 40:51.249
So congratulations.
Really a pleasure to watch.

40:51.249 --> 40:52.583
Thank you, Carson.

40:52.583 --> 40:54.085
I'm really proud of you.

40:54.085 --> 40:56.354
That means so much coming--
to hear from you, Michelle.

40:56.354 --> 40:57.422
My God, thank you.

40:57.422 --> 40:58.589
Well, you've done it.

40:58.589 --> 41:00.158
Thank you.

41:00.158 --> 41:03.127
Up next, Monique Heart.

41:03.127 --> 41:05.096
This is probably my favorite
look of all time of yours.

41:05.096 --> 41:07.799
It's beautiful. It's tasteful.
The details are there.

41:07.799 --> 41:09.233
I love the hair.
I love the makeup.

41:09.233 --> 41:11.302
It's just--it's exactly
what we want to see.

41:11.302 --> 41:13.638
In the performance tonight,
you were also very present,

41:13.638 --> 41:16.207
very engaged,
nailing all of your steps,

41:16.207 --> 41:18.009
giving us great hairography.

41:18.009 --> 41:21.479
I was very concerned about you
during the rehearsal process,

41:21.479 --> 41:23.281
because it seemed like
it was taking a lot

41:23.281 --> 41:25.049
for you to learn
the choreography.

41:25.049 --> 41:27.151
But, baby,
when those lights turned on,

41:27.151 --> 41:29.320
it was really, really
truly magical.

41:29.320 --> 41:30.621
And I love your story.

41:30.621 --> 41:31.856
You're living proof

41:31.856 --> 41:33.524
that you can in with talent
and determination,

41:33.524 --> 41:34.692
you can make it to the top.

41:34.692 --> 41:38.596
You know, all we can
ever judge you queens on

41:38.596 --> 41:41.132
are what you bring
to the runway, right?

41:41.132 --> 41:43.534
And there have been
a few girls in the past

41:43.534 --> 41:45.870
who I didn't know
I was in love with

41:45.870 --> 41:50.174
until I watched the show back
and could see you backstage.

41:50.174 --> 41:51.542
I remember watching Season 10,

41:51.542 --> 41:53.878
and thinking, oh, my God,
she's hilarious.

41:53.878 --> 41:55.313
Like I didn't see it up here.

41:55.313 --> 41:56.881
I didn't know it was all there.

41:56.881 --> 41:58.483
So something was holding back.

41:58.483 --> 42:00.852
I think the difference
between that and this

42:00.852 --> 42:05.223
is we saw a lot more
of Monique Heart this time.

42:05.223 --> 42:08.493
And I think that was important
that you got that girl out.

42:08.493 --> 42:11.195
We saw good weeks,
we saw not as good weeks,

42:11.195 --> 42:12.663
and we saw truth.

42:12.663 --> 42:14.432
And I think that was important

42:14.432 --> 42:17.635
for us
to get to know you that way.

42:17.635 --> 42:20.271
I say Nie-omi,
you say Nay-omi.

42:20.271 --> 42:23.574
When I heard you were
coming back for All Stars 4,

42:23.574 --> 42:26.444
I was very excited,
and you did not disappoint.

42:26.444 --> 42:29.347
We knew you could turn
a fashion look in your season,

42:29.347 --> 42:31.916
but you have really,
really elevated,

42:31.916 --> 42:33.518
and it's absolutely stunning.

42:33.518 --> 42:36.754
This look is everything.
It's so fun.

42:36.754 --> 42:39.357
When you came out,
I was like audibly gasping.

42:39.357 --> 42:41.125
I remember this like
Louis Vuitton campaign

42:41.125 --> 42:42.827
and they did the Argentine--
[Naomi] Yes.

42:42.827 --> 42:44.996
[Carson] Kind of cowboy hat,
cowgirl hat.

42:44.996 --> 42:47.832
I'm totally getting it,
but you did it your way.

42:47.832 --> 42:50.768
And your performance,
it was really fun.

42:50.768 --> 42:53.137
The words
didn't say much to me.

42:53.137 --> 42:56.207
I'm not going to lie.
Vogue, pow, pose.

42:56.207 --> 42:58.876
But the legs up in the beginning
was really fun,

42:58.876 --> 43:00.378
and I thought you had
a good time with it,

43:00.378 --> 43:02.647
and you were doing what you do.

43:02.647 --> 43:04.749
You did everything you had
to do to learn the choreography,

43:04.749 --> 43:05.950
which was not easy.

43:05.950 --> 43:08.052
Having to turn
and be lifted from behind

43:08.052 --> 43:09.554
by people
you didn't know for sure

43:09.554 --> 43:10.988
if they were going
to be there or not.

43:10.988 --> 43:12.723
You had to completely surrender

43:12.723 --> 43:15.760
and just trust that everything
was going to fall into place,

43:15.760 --> 43:17.161
and you did exactly that.

43:17.161 --> 43:20.698
I also feel like I really
got to know you this season,

43:20.698 --> 43:22.433
and that's been just a joy.

43:22.433 --> 43:25.369
I've seen you, eyes wide open,
eager to learn,

43:25.369 --> 43:28.873
eager to listen, eager to try,
eager to improve.

43:28.873 --> 43:31.542
It's so fun to watch somebody

43:31.542 --> 43:33.544
do exactly
what they're meant to do.

43:33.544 --> 43:34.579
I'm really proud of you.

43:34.579 --> 43:36.314
Thank you, Ross.

43:36.314 --> 43:37.615
Trinity The Tuck.

43:37.615 --> 43:40.351
Tonight, in your performance,

43:40.351 --> 43:42.987
I mean, everything
from the shoes to the tuck,

43:42.987 --> 43:47.758
up to the headpiece, the boobs,
it's like a drag orgasm.

43:47.758 --> 43:50.161
[Todrick] You out of
all of these seasons,

43:50.161 --> 43:51.963
are one of the cleanest dancers.

43:51.963 --> 43:54.999
Yeah, you might not be
a Misty Copeland-esque bitch,

43:54.999 --> 43:59.036
but you are definitely somebody
who can deliver choreography,

43:59.036 --> 44:00.238
and when I give you notes,

44:00.238 --> 44:02.140
you are always so willing
to take them.

44:02.140 --> 44:04.442
You are such a pro
through and through,

44:04.442 --> 44:05.977
and that can sometimes
be a double-edged sword,

44:05.977 --> 44:08.112
because you sometimes
maybe overthink it.

44:08.112 --> 44:11.883
And the only thing is that
sometimes in the performance,

44:11.883 --> 44:13.951
it looked like you were
thinking about what's next

44:13.951 --> 44:16.554
instead of being in the moment.

44:16.554 --> 44:18.556
But still, phenomenal job.

44:18.556 --> 44:19.690
I love this look.

44:19.690 --> 44:21.225
This is like a Dolce & Gabbana

44:21.225 --> 44:23.661
one-of-a-kind couture piece

44:23.661 --> 44:26.297
when it's super chic
and glamorous,

44:26.297 --> 44:28.466
but it also has
this one little twist.

44:28.466 --> 44:30.701
That to me is drag perfection.

44:30.701 --> 44:31.836
[Michelle]
This is quite honestly

44:31.836 --> 44:33.237
one of my favorite looks
I've ever seen

44:33.237 --> 44:35.406
on any queen in all these years.

44:35.406 --> 44:38.075
Do you know that girl in the
movie who you're rooting for,

44:38.075 --> 44:39.577
and then it looks like
she's dead?

44:39.577 --> 44:42.280
And then all of a sudden, her
hand comes out of the ground.

44:42.280 --> 44:43.981
There was a moment
when you could have gone home.

44:43.981 --> 44:45.283
-Do you remember?
-Mm-hmm.

44:45.283 --> 44:46.884
[Ross] And I remember
seeing in your eyes

44:46.884 --> 44:49.253
how badly you wanted to stay.

44:49.253 --> 44:52.156
And from that moment on,
you've been soaring.

44:52.156 --> 44:54.825
I'm proud of you,
Trinity. Really.

44:54.825 --> 44:56.727
You've outdone yourself,

44:56.727 --> 44:58.896
which is really the point
of doing All Stars.

44:58.896 --> 45:00.965
-Thank you.
[Michelle] Game well played.

45:00.965 --> 45:03.000
Well, I want to say
to each of you,

45:03.000 --> 45:06.037
I am so proud of your journey

45:06.037 --> 45:09.173
and your being so willing
and so gracious

45:09.173 --> 45:11.175
to not only share your stories,

45:11.175 --> 45:15.713
but share your triumphs
and your failures, too.

45:15.713 --> 45:20.551
And I could not be more proud
of you four ladies

45:20.551 --> 45:22.119
standing on this stage
right now.

45:22.119 --> 45:23.321
Really well done.

45:23.321 --> 45:25.690
Really, really well done.

45:25.690 --> 45:27.291
You're all winners.

45:29.727 --> 45:31.162
Final question.

45:31.162 --> 45:33.831
Why should you be inducted

45:33.831 --> 45:37.335
into the Drag Race
Hall of Fame?

45:37.335 --> 45:38.703
Monét.

45:38.703 --> 45:40.938
RuPaul's Drag Race
was one of the first shows

45:40.938 --> 45:45.610
that I found on television
that I saw myself.

45:45.610 --> 45:50.481
To be in this moment
in front of y'all on this stage,

45:50.481 --> 45:54.719
I know that some kid is
sneaking into his mother's room

45:54.719 --> 45:56.187
when she's not home
and watching the show

45:56.187 --> 45:58.623
and seeing themselves in me

45:58.623 --> 46:00.958
and discovering that they have
that person inside of them.

46:00.958 --> 46:03.661
I do believe that everything
does happen for a reason.

46:03.661 --> 46:06.831
I don't know who, if it's a God,
if it's a sea slug,

46:06.831 --> 46:08.466
whoever it is,
I do feel like

46:08.466 --> 46:10.368
I'm supposed to be here
at this time,

46:10.368 --> 46:11.836
and show you guys
that I do listen

46:11.836 --> 46:14.205
and I do take in what you are
telling me to perfect my drag

46:14.205 --> 46:15.539
and to take it
to the next level.

46:15.539 --> 46:17.808
And I'm just fucking grateful.

46:17.808 --> 46:21.445
-Fucking grateful.
-[laughs]

46:21.445 --> 46:23.014
Monique, same question.

46:23.014 --> 46:26.851
I came with nothing
and created something.

46:26.851 --> 46:28.953
Got the call to come back.

46:28.953 --> 46:32.456
And I said, bitch,
I'm going to do it this time.

46:32.456 --> 46:35.926
And I believe that
with this opportunity,

46:35.926 --> 46:41.499
it just solidifies, like,
all the bullshit of who am I.

46:41.499 --> 46:44.468
I came out the gate
winning that first week,

46:44.468 --> 46:47.138
and then kept trying
and got knocked

46:47.138 --> 46:49.273
and almost went home
and kept fighting.

46:49.273 --> 46:51.575
And I feel like
that is why I am

46:51.575 --> 46:53.811
America's next
Drag Race All Star.

46:53.811 --> 46:55.246
Naomi Smalls.

46:55.246 --> 46:57.715
I had an amazing opportunity

46:57.715 --> 47:01.552
to come and compete
at the Olympics of drag.

47:01.552 --> 47:04.989
And through actually competing
in the competition,

47:04.989 --> 47:08.192
it's helped me become
such a better person.

47:08.192 --> 47:11.195
I would love to be told
I'm the best by the best

47:11.195 --> 47:15.733
and show people
no dream is too outlandish.

47:15.733 --> 47:19.470
As long as you work hard
and believe in yourself,

47:19.470 --> 47:21.505
anything is possible.

47:21.505 --> 47:23.174
Trinity The Tuck.

47:23.174 --> 47:25.710
I stand before you
as an entertainer

47:25.710 --> 47:29.046
that's been in the business
for over 15 years.

47:29.046 --> 47:32.883
I don't think that's a reason
why I should win.

47:32.883 --> 47:37.722
I don't feel entitled
to this title,

47:37.722 --> 47:41.359
but I do feel like
I have earned it.

47:41.359 --> 47:45.763
I feel like this season
I have shown all of you judges

47:45.763 --> 47:48.766
how hard I've worked,

47:48.766 --> 47:50.267
and shown that

47:50.267 --> 47:52.103
no matter how long
you've been in the business,

47:52.103 --> 47:53.938
you continue to grow.

47:53.938 --> 47:57.308
And that's why I deserve
to be your winner.

47:57.308 --> 47:58.709
Thank you, ladies.

47:58.709 --> 47:59.944
I think we've heard enough.

47:59.944 --> 48:02.780
Now, while you untuck
in the workroom,

48:02.780 --> 48:05.049
for the first time this season,

48:05.049 --> 48:07.551
the judges and I
will deliberate.

48:08.886 --> 48:10.621
You may leave the stage.

48:12.056 --> 48:15.693
All right. Just between
us squirrel-friends,

48:15.693 --> 48:19.430
I want to know what
you all think of our girls.

48:19.430 --> 48:21.365
Monét X Change.

48:21.365 --> 48:23.033
I am just blown away by her.

48:23.033 --> 48:26.470
From her season,
she really upped her game.

48:26.470 --> 48:29.573
She started out
in that sponge little leotard,

48:29.573 --> 48:31.242
and I was like, please, God.

48:31.242 --> 48:32.877
[all laugh]
Please, God, no.

48:32.877 --> 48:36.080
Let this be the only thing
we're looking at here

48:36.080 --> 48:37.248
with soaking ability.

48:37.248 --> 48:38.816
And that was it.

48:38.816 --> 48:42.052
She stepped it up each week
higher and higher.

48:42.052 --> 48:43.521
[Carson] And look
at her look tonight.

48:43.521 --> 48:45.489
It was spectacular

48:45.489 --> 48:47.958
and fun
and has a real point of view.

48:47.958 --> 48:49.426
And I have to tell you,

48:49.426 --> 48:52.396
her performance tonight
was one of my favorites.

48:52.396 --> 48:55.499
I absolutely loved her so much.

48:55.499 --> 48:59.036
Monét X Change proved
that she has the X factor.

48:59.036 --> 49:01.038
She has what it takes
to be a star.

49:01.038 --> 49:03.140
And I think she has what it
takes to win this whole thing.

49:03.140 --> 49:05.509
I think she is incredibly
talented, incredibly funny,

49:05.509 --> 49:07.912
and the biggest thing that
I love about Monét X Change

49:07.912 --> 49:08.913
is her heart.

49:08.913 --> 49:10.314
At the end
of this competition,

49:10.314 --> 49:12.016
we want somebody
that goes out there

49:12.016 --> 49:13.951
and really represents RuPaul
in a great way.

49:13.951 --> 49:15.853
And I think
she has the personality

49:15.853 --> 49:17.855
to really entertain
an audience at a club

49:17.855 --> 49:20.791
and make people forget
about the worries and issues

49:20.791 --> 49:22.159
that they're having
in their day-to-day lives.

49:22.159 --> 49:24.929
I just love Monét X Change.

49:24.929 --> 49:26.130
What a great sense of humor.

49:26.130 --> 49:27.965
Such a likeable queen.

49:27.965 --> 49:31.602
And I've enjoyed every time
I've had a chance to talk to her

49:31.602 --> 49:32.837
and watch her perform.

49:32.837 --> 49:35.940
She really does have
her own point of view,

49:35.940 --> 49:39.476
and I think that's
the mark of a true star.

49:39.476 --> 49:41.378
Monique Heart.

49:41.378 --> 49:43.013
I think from
a fashion perspective,

49:43.013 --> 49:45.149
she gave us
some really stellar looks.

49:45.149 --> 49:47.918
Her curves and swerves
looked incredible.

49:47.918 --> 49:50.287
Her angelic white look
was really impressive.

49:50.287 --> 49:52.456
But it's just
maybe not consistent enough.

49:52.456 --> 49:55.526
My problem still lies
within her aesthetic.

49:55.526 --> 49:56.727
I thought this was pretty.

49:56.727 --> 49:57.761
It's probably
one of the prettiest

49:57.761 --> 49:59.230
we've ever seen her look.

49:59.230 --> 50:01.165
But again, there's things
that were off on it.

50:01.165 --> 50:03.467
Like putting all of the fluff
in the middle,

50:03.467 --> 50:05.202
where you don't even see
her waist anymore,

50:05.202 --> 50:07.104
and then putting gloves
that kind of mesh in.

50:07.104 --> 50:08.772
It didn't make sense.

50:08.772 --> 50:10.441
And in the Super Queens
performance,

50:10.441 --> 50:12.810
she did her thing,
she got a lot of hair-shaking,

50:12.810 --> 50:14.278
you know, and that's
exactly what she does.

50:14.278 --> 50:15.579
I think that Monique Heart

50:15.579 --> 50:17.181
is very big
on the performance factor,

50:17.181 --> 50:18.983
and she delivered that tonight.

50:18.983 --> 50:21.719
I tell you what,
she definitely has the passion

50:21.719 --> 50:23.320
and she definitely wants it.

50:23.320 --> 50:24.755
[Ross]
And she's gonna get it.

50:24.755 --> 50:27.358
She's gonna have a huge career,

50:27.358 --> 50:30.294
because I believe she's
in the fight for the long run.

50:30.294 --> 50:32.196
She's a very
interesting person.

50:32.196 --> 50:33.797
She's very emotional.

50:33.797 --> 50:36.033
Her name
really does speak to that.

50:36.033 --> 50:38.302
She wears her heart
on her sleeve.

50:38.302 --> 50:40.771
And she does, at times,
put up a defense,

50:40.771 --> 50:42.406
but just below the surface

50:42.406 --> 50:46.176
is a really deep, deep queen

50:46.176 --> 50:50.481
who is going to go far and who
is really an important part

50:50.481 --> 50:53.017
of our story here at Drag Race.

50:53.017 --> 50:54.885
Naomi Smalls.

50:54.885 --> 50:59.156
I've got one word to say
about Naomi this entire series.

50:59.156 --> 51:00.758
Prince.

51:00.758 --> 51:01.825
[RuPaul laughs]

51:01.825 --> 51:03.327
[Ross] Oh, my God.

51:03.327 --> 51:06.297
I think that was one of the
best looks this entire season.

51:06.297 --> 51:08.532
She does excite me when
she walks around that corner.

51:08.532 --> 51:10.134
You don't know
what she's going to have on,

51:10.134 --> 51:12.703
but you do know there's
gonna be a beginning, middle,

51:12.703 --> 51:14.171
and end to that story,

51:14.171 --> 51:15.306
and that story's gonna be one

51:15.306 --> 51:16.340
that you want to see
over and over again.

51:16.340 --> 51:17.574
That's true.

51:17.574 --> 51:18.809
[Ross] When I look at Naomi,

51:18.809 --> 51:23.380
she looks to me
like the drag of right now.

51:23.380 --> 51:25.015
I would buy a ticket
to go see her,

51:25.015 --> 51:27.318
just because
she's so fucking gorgeous.

51:27.318 --> 51:29.253
[Todrick] Is she a gymnast?
Probably not.

51:29.253 --> 51:31.255
Will she ever be? No.

51:31.255 --> 51:32.723
But I think that she's
an amazing drag queen,

51:32.723 --> 51:35.326
and I think that she's
really fought hard to be here.

51:35.326 --> 51:38.896
I think she gets herself
stuck in a rut

51:38.896 --> 51:41.131
of wanting to just pose
and look pretty.

51:41.131 --> 51:43.067
Now, she has challenged herself,

51:43.067 --> 51:44.702
and she has brought us
some good moments.

51:44.702 --> 51:46.670
We had fun with her
in The Snatch Game.

51:46.670 --> 51:48.872
I actually had fun
in Jersey Justice with her.

51:48.872 --> 51:50.574
So she's let herself
out of her shell

51:50.574 --> 51:53.377
more than she did on her season
a hundred times over,

51:53.377 --> 51:55.612
and I'm super proud of her
for doing that.

51:55.612 --> 51:57.881
I do think
she has further to go.

51:57.881 --> 51:59.817
You know, we need a singer,
we need a dancer,

51:59.817 --> 52:02.419
we need an actress, we need
a comedian, we need a glamazon.

52:02.419 --> 52:06.724
And she checks several of those
boxes, but not all of them.

52:06.724 --> 52:09.626
And I'm a Scorpio and I'm still
mad she eliminated Manila Luzon.

52:09.626 --> 52:11.528
[all laugh]

52:11.528 --> 52:13.097
[RuPaul] Trinity The Tuck.

52:13.097 --> 52:15.366
[Michelle] She came with
guns a-blazing, you guys.

52:15.366 --> 52:17.301
She came out
right from the beginning,

52:17.301 --> 52:20.204
right from the first
talent show, and made us laugh.

52:20.204 --> 52:22.006
[Ross] And when she played
Caitlyn Jenner

52:22.006 --> 52:24.508
in The Snatch Game,
it was perfection.

52:24.508 --> 52:26.777
It has been a joy
to watch her come back

52:26.777 --> 52:28.312
with something to prove
and prove it.

52:28.312 --> 52:30.714
[Michelle] Every time that bitch
came around the corner,

52:30.714 --> 52:32.750
my mouth, it was agape.

52:32.750 --> 52:37.921
I was mesmerized by everything
that girl wore on the runway.

52:37.921 --> 52:40.924
She is not a dancer,
but she's so willing to commit.

52:40.924 --> 52:42.793
She wants it so bad.

52:42.793 --> 52:45.129
And Trinity
is still as humble today

52:45.129 --> 52:47.931
as she was the first time
I worked with her,

52:47.931 --> 52:50.000
which was not very humble, but
the point is she didn't change.

52:50.000 --> 52:51.735
[laughs]

52:51.735 --> 52:53.704
Todrick, I have to disagree.

52:53.704 --> 52:55.439
I think she's changed.
Her ass looks bigger to me.

52:55.439 --> 52:57.241
[laughs]

52:57.241 --> 53:00.244
I am like the number one
like Trinity fan.

53:00.244 --> 53:03.847
There were a couple moments
in the Super Queen performance

53:03.847 --> 53:05.816
where you didn't want
to stop looking at her

53:05.816 --> 53:07.051
because she was dazzling.

53:07.051 --> 53:08.118
But you could see kind of

53:08.118 --> 53:09.787
that she was thinking
about the step

53:09.787 --> 53:10.888
that came after the one
that she was currently doing.

53:10.888 --> 53:12.389
Definitely.

53:12.389 --> 53:16.627
Whereas Monét was kind of
living her best life on stage

53:16.627 --> 53:17.928
and living the moment,

53:17.928 --> 53:21.265
sometimes Trinity
gets a little too prepared,

53:21.265 --> 53:22.966
and not maybe not
in the moment enough.

53:22.966 --> 53:26.270
She reminds me of the queens
I grew up watching in Atlanta.

53:26.270 --> 53:29.540
She is a modern version
of that queen.

53:29.540 --> 53:33.243
And she is so exciting to watch.

53:33.243 --> 53:34.244
[Carson] And that ass.

53:34.244 --> 53:37.081
-And that ass.
-That ass, though.

53:37.081 --> 53:38.816
[clap clap]
-Silence.

53:38.816 --> 53:41.351
I've made my decision.

53:41.351 --> 53:43.954
Bring back my All Stars.

53:46.957 --> 53:49.827
Welcome back, ladies.

53:49.827 --> 53:52.496
Based on your performances
tonight

53:52.496 --> 53:56.433
and throughout this competition,
I've made some decisions.

54:02.539 --> 54:03.907
Monét X Change.

54:05.342 --> 54:06.577
Trinity The Tuck.

54:07.911 --> 54:09.413
Con-drag-ulations.

54:09.413 --> 54:11.448
You are the top two
All Stars of the season.

54:11.448 --> 54:13.917
[applause]
-Thank you.

54:17.921 --> 54:20.691
Monique Heart.

54:20.691 --> 54:22.659
Naomi Smalls.

54:22.659 --> 54:25.496
I'm sorry, my dears,
this is not your time.

54:25.496 --> 54:32.169
But you are
and will always be All Stars.

54:32.169 --> 54:34.838
Would you please step
to the back of the stage?

54:34.838 --> 54:37.541
[applause]

54:37.541 --> 54:41.211
I'm leaving here
with my head held high.

54:41.211 --> 54:43.247
I feel like
I really proved to myself

54:43.247 --> 54:45.149
that I can compete
against the best of the best.

54:45.149 --> 54:48.185
Naomi Smalls is going
to continue to grow

54:48.185 --> 54:50.287
and continue to surprise you

54:50.287 --> 54:53.924
and take over
the motherfucking world, bitch.

54:53.924 --> 54:56.260
[Monique] I'm extremely
proud of myself.

54:56.260 --> 54:58.562
I said I was here
to reclaim my time, and I did.

54:58.562 --> 55:01.331
I didn't snatch the crown,
but I was close to it.

55:01.331 --> 55:03.300
But it is not the end
of my story,

55:03.300 --> 55:04.301
and I know it.

55:06.303 --> 55:11.708
Monét, Trinity,
there's only one thing

55:11.708 --> 55:16.246
standing between you
and the Drag Race Hall of Fame.

55:16.246 --> 55:20.317
Two top All Stars
stand before me.

55:20.317 --> 55:24.655
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me

55:24.655 --> 55:27.791
and to prove to the world

55:27.791 --> 55:31.695
you belong in
the Drag Race Hall of Fame.

55:33.330 --> 55:36.833
The time has come
for you to lip sync...

55:36.833 --> 55:42.506
[echoing] for your legacy.

55:42.506 --> 55:46.710
I am super close to winning
this whole competition, girl.

55:46.710 --> 55:50.480
It's just a lip sync
stands between me and a crown,

55:50.480 --> 55:53.250
a scepter, and $100,000.

55:53.250 --> 55:56.954
I can taste the crown,
and I want it.

55:56.954 --> 56:01.491
Everything in my life
has led me up to this moment.

56:01.491 --> 56:04.494
I'm so close to my dream

56:04.494 --> 56:06.496
and I'm about to jump through

56:06.496 --> 56:10.067
whatever fiery hoop
I have to, bitch,

56:10.067 --> 56:14.171
because I'm not leaving
without this crown.

56:14.171 --> 56:16.206
Good luck,

56:16.206 --> 56:19.543
and don't fuck it up.
