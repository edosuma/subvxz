WEBVTT

00:11.145 --> 00:13.547
Okay, she can have the car.

00:15.049 --> 00:16.050
Yeah, and the furniture.

00:16.150 --> 00:17.718
I don't know.

00:17.818 --> 00:20.454
My God, we are dividing assets.

00:21.222 --> 00:23.357
What? No.

00:24.125 --> 00:25.859
There's no way
I can afford to pay

00:25.959 --> 00:27.528
that much in spousal support.

00:27.628 --> 00:29.430
What? Hold... Can you remind

00:29.530 --> 00:31.665
Kathleen that
I'm a poor journalist

00:31.765 --> 00:33.967
and not a billionaire?

00:34.068 --> 00:35.169
No, I can't...

00:35.269 --> 00:36.704
I can't believe
this is happening.

00:36.804 --> 00:39.607
All she did was complain
that I worked too much.

00:39.707 --> 00:41.375
You know? And that's it, okay?

00:41.475 --> 00:42.643
Forget it.

00:42.743 --> 00:44.545
I-I'm gone.

00:52.553 --> 00:54.155
All right.

00:54.255 --> 00:56.290
I'm ready.

00:56.390 --> 00:59.393
All of the forms and documents
for the legal separation

00:59.493 --> 01:01.262
are complete.

01:01.362 --> 01:02.763
After we file this,

01:02.863 --> 01:04.698
the serve by
publication will run

01:04.798 --> 01:06.767
in three newspapers
for 12 business days.

01:06.867 --> 01:07.568
Okay.

01:07.668 --> 01:09.503
This is my life,

01:09.603 --> 01:12.773
putting an ad in the
newspaper in Iceland

01:12.873 --> 01:16.710
to tell my missing husband
that our marriage is over.

01:17.611 --> 01:19.147
Okay. Thank you, Susan.

01:19.247 --> 01:20.348
Of course.

01:20.448 --> 01:21.415
When is your wedding?

01:21.515 --> 01:23.617
Nine months and counting. Hmm.

01:23.717 --> 01:24.918
And you're not doing a prenup?

01:25.018 --> 01:26.587
No, I-I didn't want to be...

01:26.687 --> 01:27.988
No, no, no, no.
You don't have to explain.

01:28.156 --> 01:31.058
I am probably
the wrong person to consult

01:31.159 --> 01:32.626
on that...

01:32.726 --> 01:35.596
particular subject
at this moment.

01:35.696 --> 01:37.998
Wait, which subject? By the way,

01:38.166 --> 01:39.167
report done.

01:39.267 --> 01:40.201
Todd, take your leg

01:40.301 --> 01:41.769
off the arm of that chair.

01:41.869 --> 01:43.537
Okay, but wait, which subject
are you the wrong person for?

01:43.637 --> 01:45.439
Pirates? Zombies? Lasers?

01:45.539 --> 01:46.440
Blazers.

01:46.540 --> 01:47.608
Pre-nuptial agreements.

01:47.708 --> 01:48.609
Oh.
Peter and I

01:48.709 --> 01:49.677
aren't doing one.

01:49.777 --> 01:51.379
And that's perfectly fine.

01:51.479 --> 01:54.081
I mean, God only knows what
the future holds for any of us.

01:54.182 --> 01:56.884
Had I realized that I would
one day be responsible

01:56.984 --> 01:58.486
for Harry's membership

01:58.586 --> 02:00.354
at the Wildwood
Athletic Club,

02:00.454 --> 02:02.055
I probably would have
gone into my marriage

02:02.190 --> 02:03.424
with a little
more protection.

02:03.524 --> 02:04.592
All right,
Susan, thank you.

02:04.692 --> 02:05.826
See you in ten minutes.

02:05.926 --> 02:08.796
Todd. Chair. Arm. Leg.

02:08.896 --> 02:10.631
Thank you. Sorry.

02:14.202 --> 02:16.237
Wait, is she finally
divorcing Harry?

02:16.337 --> 02:17.771
No.

02:18.606 --> 02:20.007
Legal separation.

02:20.107 --> 02:22.810
Oh.
She says she's
not ready for anything

02:22.910 --> 02:24.745
as drastic as divorce,

02:24.845 --> 02:27.047
but is ready
to explore her options.

02:27.215 --> 02:28.916
She needs to
cut that jerk loose.

02:29.016 --> 02:30.218
And where are you two going?

02:30.218 --> 02:32.119
Our trial resumes
in 30 minutes.

02:32.220 --> 02:33.287
Kathleen Baylis,

02:33.387 --> 02:34.255
accused of murdering
her husband.

02:34.355 --> 02:35.556
The journalist?

02:35.656 --> 02:38.326
Oh, right, right, right.
Lyle got that case.

02:38.426 --> 02:41.862
Lucky. Meanwhile, I'm stuck
on Portland's death trolley.

02:41.962 --> 02:42.830
MAX?

02:42.930 --> 02:44.465
The light rail train?

02:44.565 --> 02:46.434
Hit all those cyclists,
people are calling it SMAX now?

02:46.534 --> 02:47.868
It's a class action suit,

02:47.968 --> 02:50.371
but for me,
it's just a ton of paperwork.

02:50.471 --> 02:51.372
That's the real tragedy.

02:51.472 --> 02:53.241
Hmm. Bye, Todd.

02:53.241 --> 02:54.908
I'm kidding.

02:55.976 --> 02:57.511
<i>Detective Anten,</i>

02:57.611 --> 02:59.913
you're a member of
the Portland Anti-Crime Team,

03:00.013 --> 03:01.349
known as P.A.C.T., correct?

03:01.449 --> 03:03.251
Yes.
And this is a
special task force

03:03.251 --> 03:05.619
meant to reduce crime
in North Portland,

03:05.719 --> 03:07.288
correct?
That is correct.

03:07.388 --> 03:09.357
But isn't one of the fastest
growing criminal organizations

03:09.457 --> 03:13.961
in that area a biker gang,
the Pioneer Ghosts?

03:14.061 --> 03:15.263
I can't quantify that,

03:15.263 --> 03:16.897
but they do
have a presence, yes.

03:16.997 --> 03:20.268
Okay. But were you aware
that Keith Baylis

03:20.268 --> 03:22.570
was two days away
from publishing an exposÃ©

03:22.670 --> 03:25.573
on the Pioneer Ghosts
and their criminal activity?

03:25.673 --> 03:27.074
I was aware of that, yes.

03:27.174 --> 03:30.043
Well, a member of
the biker gang could have

03:30.143 --> 03:32.079
framed Kathleen Baylis
for the murder of her husband.

03:32.179 --> 03:33.781
I mean,
they had motive, and yet...

03:33.881 --> 03:35.316
She had motive.

03:35.416 --> 03:36.784
And the murder weapon
was found in her car.

03:36.884 --> 03:38.185
Her alibi is
she was sleeping.

03:38.286 --> 03:41.522
Please wait for my question
before answering.

03:41.622 --> 03:42.956
And yet, you

03:43.056 --> 03:45.025
zeroed in on my client.

03:45.125 --> 03:48.195
Now, what was
the probable cause

03:48.296 --> 03:50.531
for searching
Kathleen Baylis's home?

03:50.631 --> 03:52.199
A confidential informant

03:52.300 --> 03:54.167
notified P.A.C.T.
that Kathleen Baylis

03:54.302 --> 03:56.169
had bought
a 9mm Glock 19

03:56.304 --> 03:58.105
with wiped serial numbers
days before the murder,

03:58.205 --> 04:00.040
and the bullet
that was retrieved

04:00.140 --> 04:02.610
from the chest of
the victim matched that weapon.

04:02.710 --> 04:04.312
A confidential informant.

04:04.312 --> 04:05.846
A C.I.

04:05.946 --> 04:07.348
That was your
only probable cause?

04:07.448 --> 04:10.117
An unverified anonymous source?

04:10.217 --> 04:12.353
And your client
was an angry, bitter,

04:12.453 --> 04:13.521
soon-to-be ex-wife

04:13.621 --> 04:14.555
in the middle
of a contentious divorce.

04:14.655 --> 04:16.056
Just stay calm.

04:17.124 --> 04:20.227
Um, there are lots of angry,

04:20.328 --> 04:22.763
bitter ex-wives
out there, detective.

04:22.863 --> 04:25.333
That doesn't
make them murderers.

04:26.800 --> 04:27.935
The night of her arrest,

04:28.035 --> 04:29.937
her behavior
was very aggressive.

04:30.037 --> 04:31.439
I cuffed her, and she said

04:31.539 --> 04:32.706
that she was glad
her husband was dead.

04:32.806 --> 04:33.741
That's a lie!

04:33.841 --> 04:35.008
I never said that.

04:35.108 --> 04:36.477
You lying piece of...

04:38.078 --> 04:39.813
Yep, that is
the aggression that I saw.

04:39.913 --> 04:41.449
I understand.

04:41.549 --> 04:43.551
That's enough, Mrs. Baylis.
One more outburst like that

04:43.651 --> 04:45.152
and you'll be held
in contempt of court.

04:45.252 --> 04:46.354
Okay.

04:51.425 --> 04:53.461
Margaret, I did not
kill my husband.
I know.

04:53.561 --> 04:55.363
That wasn't my gun.
Yes, I know.

04:55.363 --> 04:56.830
Oh, my God,
I'm being framed.

04:56.930 --> 04:58.165
I should
take the stand.

04:58.265 --> 05:00.534
The jury needs
to hear my side.

05:00.634 --> 05:02.370
Kathleen, that is not
a good idea,

05:02.370 --> 05:04.037
especially after
that outburst in court.

05:04.137 --> 05:05.439
And the angry
text messages,

05:05.539 --> 05:07.975
showing up to his office,
threatening to kill him.

05:08.075 --> 05:10.411
Well, I did want to
kill him. I did.

05:10.511 --> 05:13.213
Okay, fine.
But he was never around.

05:13.381 --> 05:16.384
He was always working,
and he lied about everything.

05:16.384 --> 05:17.985
I know his job
was secretive, fine,

05:18.085 --> 05:19.487
but how do I know

05:19.587 --> 05:21.822
he wasn't having an affair?
How did I know anything?

05:21.922 --> 05:22.923
You felt foolish for ever having

05:23.023 --> 05:23.891
trusted him in the first place.

05:23.991 --> 05:26.427
Yes, but trust me,

05:26.527 --> 05:28.028
if I were going to kill him,

05:28.128 --> 05:30.398
I wouldn't shoot him with a gun.

05:30.398 --> 05:33.567
I would poison him
slowly so I could enjoy

05:33.667 --> 05:36.203
every second of
his agonizing death.

05:36.303 --> 05:38.439
Oh, please, you never
really love someone

05:38.539 --> 05:39.640
unless you've fantasized about

05:39.740 --> 05:41.041
killing them
at least a few times.

05:41.141 --> 05:43.276
I understand, I really do,

05:43.411 --> 05:46.046
but you cannot share that
sentiment with the jury.

05:46.146 --> 05:48.148
We've already
got an uphill battle

05:48.248 --> 05:49.950
with this Luke Anten, and...
Oh, my God.

05:50.050 --> 05:52.420
I'm going to prison for
the rest of my life, aren't I?

05:52.520 --> 05:55.022
I know you didn't do it,

05:55.122 --> 05:58.426
and I'm going to
find a way to prove that.

06:11.338 --> 06:13.006
Sorry, I'm here
to see my mother,

06:13.106 --> 06:14.808
but I seem to have
the wrong office.

06:14.908 --> 06:16.444
I'm allowed to work in here.

06:16.444 --> 06:17.778
My last name
is also on the door,

06:17.878 --> 06:20.047
plus I'm all out of staples
in my cubby.

06:20.147 --> 06:21.582
Hmm.

06:21.682 --> 06:22.916
Ooh, a file marked "Harry."

06:23.016 --> 06:24.351
That sounds ominous.

06:24.452 --> 06:25.886
Yeah, it's all the bills
Mom's stuck with

06:25.986 --> 06:27.888
because she's still
legally married to that idiot.

06:27.988 --> 06:29.757
Here's some additional research
on the Pioneer Ghosts,

06:29.857 --> 06:32.292
but I just think that...
Oh, it's you.

06:32.460 --> 06:33.694
It's always me.

06:33.794 --> 06:34.928
And Allison,

06:35.028 --> 06:36.530
it's nice to
see you again. Likewise.

06:36.630 --> 06:39.099
I'm sorry you had to find
this belligerent mole-person

06:39.199 --> 06:40.233
at your
mother's desk.

06:40.333 --> 06:41.535
She should be back
any moment now,

06:41.635 --> 06:43.504
but fair warning,
she's in a terrible mood.

06:43.604 --> 06:45.873
Why?
She's losing
her murder trial,

06:45.973 --> 06:47.741
and it's killing her,
so I recommend that...

06:47.841 --> 06:49.276
Todd, what are you
doing at my desk?

06:49.376 --> 06:51.244
Allison, honey,
I can't have lunch today,

06:51.344 --> 06:53.280
I have to work.
Todd, we have talked about this.

06:53.380 --> 06:54.882
Yes, yes,
we certainly have,

06:54.982 --> 06:56.484
and I understand
you're losing your case

06:56.584 --> 06:57.785
because there's
a problem

06:57.885 --> 06:59.520
with the level
of investigative work

06:59.620 --> 07:01.154
provided to you
by someone who shall

07:01.254 --> 07:02.823
remain nameless but
whose initials are Lyle Burton.

07:02.923 --> 07:05.125
Todd, we do not have time
for nonsense right now.

07:05.225 --> 07:08.596
An innocent woman is about
to go to prison for life,

07:08.696 --> 07:09.930
and I am running
out of options.

07:10.030 --> 07:11.364
Lyle, we need to go through

07:11.499 --> 07:13.233
every single piece
of evidence again

07:13.333 --> 07:14.502
and see if we can
come up with something.

07:14.602 --> 07:16.269
On it.
The Pioneer Ghost research.

07:16.369 --> 07:17.938
Ah, thank you.

07:18.906 --> 07:19.840
Mom, why are you losing?

07:19.940 --> 07:21.208
Oh, ah.

07:21.308 --> 07:23.611
A very smug detective,
Luke Anten,

07:23.711 --> 07:25.278
who I would
like to smack.

07:25.378 --> 07:28.081
Very conveniently,
a magical informant

07:28.181 --> 07:29.216
made its way
into his lap,

07:29.316 --> 07:31.351
and provided probable cause

07:31.519 --> 07:32.986
for a search warrant
which led them

07:33.086 --> 07:35.523
right to the murder weapon
in Kathleen's car. It is crap.

07:35.523 --> 07:36.557
It's crap?
Yes.

07:36.657 --> 07:38.091
I have looked into

07:38.191 --> 07:41.361
the eyes of murderers before,
and Kathleen is not one.

07:41.529 --> 07:42.996
If she had killed him,

07:43.096 --> 07:44.364
she'd be hiding
how much she hated him,

07:44.532 --> 07:46.433
which she's not. I am so angry.

07:46.534 --> 07:48.401
Okay, well, are there
any other suspects?

07:48.536 --> 07:50.370
Ah. A biker gang.

07:50.538 --> 07:51.939
The Pioneer Ghosts.

07:52.039 --> 07:55.275
Keith Baylis was about to
publish a story on them

07:55.375 --> 07:56.977
right at the time of his death.

07:57.077 --> 07:58.846
I mean murder.

07:58.946 --> 08:01.114
But they are a very
tight-knit, secretive group,

08:01.214 --> 08:02.583
and no one is talking.

08:02.683 --> 08:04.017
Not even their leader,

08:04.117 --> 08:07.454
Josephine Fontana,
who's in prison in Salem.

08:07.555 --> 08:09.723
Oh, I'm so angry!

08:10.558 --> 08:12.459
I'm losing, I'm losing this,

08:12.560 --> 08:14.094
and on a case I should be winning.

08:14.194 --> 08:15.128
I need to win.

08:15.228 --> 08:17.197
Okay, you and I,
out of here.

08:17.297 --> 08:18.566
Let's go.
What? But I can help.

08:18.566 --> 08:19.567
Let's get
some lunch.

08:19.567 --> 08:20.601
Allison, honey, yes,

08:20.701 --> 08:21.669
take-take your brother to lunch

08:21.769 --> 08:22.936
and let me work uninterrupted.

08:23.036 --> 08:24.204
What? I don't
interrupt your work.

08:24.304 --> 08:25.573
I help your work.
Yes, you do.

08:25.573 --> 08:26.574
You are right now.
One, two, three...

08:26.674 --> 08:27.641
Okay, you can't start counting

08:27.741 --> 08:28.876
before the conversation's over

08:28.976 --> 08:30.744
I don't adhere
to nonsense rules.

08:30.844 --> 08:32.913
Go on, right now. Oh.

08:43.657 --> 08:45.225
Why are you so quiet?

08:45.325 --> 08:46.426
What are
you plotting?

08:46.594 --> 08:49.029
What? No, nothing.
I'm not... plotting.

08:49.830 --> 08:51.699
You have 17 floors to confess.

08:51.799 --> 08:53.166
What are you
talking about?

08:53.266 --> 08:55.703
16. 15.
Confess what?

08:55.803 --> 08:58.405
14. 12.
Why is everyone
counting at me today?

08:58.505 --> 08:59.439
11.

09:00.974 --> 09:03.176
My God. Um...

09:04.878 --> 09:07.147
I was thinking
I might know someone

09:07.247 --> 09:08.949
who might know if those
bikers are involved

09:09.049 --> 09:10.818
in the case
Mom's working on.

09:10.918 --> 09:12.185
Who?

09:12.285 --> 09:14.655
Nobody, just somebody
in prison in Salem.

09:14.755 --> 09:17.625
It's nothing.
Who do you
know in prison...

09:18.458 --> 09:19.693
Veronica?

09:19.793 --> 09:21.294
Todd. No.
The leader of
the biker gang

09:21.394 --> 09:22.529
You cannot be serious.
is a woman
incarcerated in Salem,

09:22.630 --> 09:23.631
and that's
where Veronica is.

09:23.631 --> 09:24.732
I think you mean that's where

09:24.832 --> 09:25.999
the woman
who ruined your life is.

09:26.099 --> 09:27.668
She has access
to this biker woman.

09:27.768 --> 09:28.669
She could
ask her a few questions.

09:28.769 --> 09:30.037
It could help Mom's case.

09:30.137 --> 09:32.272
Todd, Veronica is why
you are penniless,

09:32.372 --> 09:33.707
license-less and homeless.

09:33.807 --> 09:35.909
I can't park in my garage
because of Veronica.

09:36.009 --> 09:38.145
I'm not going back
into business with her,

09:38.245 --> 09:39.412
or sleeping with her.

09:39.512 --> 09:41.281
I'm just gonna
go talk to her.

09:41.381 --> 09:42.816
It's not a big deal.

09:42.916 --> 09:44.985
She's in prison. It's fine.

09:46.386 --> 09:47.655
God, what are you thinking?

09:47.655 --> 09:49.156
This is a terrible idea.

09:49.256 --> 09:51.959
Oh, like you haven't had any
terrible ideas lately?

09:53.694 --> 09:56.329
Look, I'm sorry,
I didn't mean that.

09:56.429 --> 09:58.031
I'm just trying
to help Mom,

09:58.131 --> 10:00.768
but I won't do it,
okay, Allison?

10:00.868 --> 10:02.335
I won't go see her. I won't.

10:02.435 --> 10:04.271
Allison?
I'm not going
to lunch with you.

10:04.371 --> 10:05.806
I won't.

10:05.906 --> 10:09.276
I won't... go see her.

10:41.942 --> 10:43.610
I can't believe
I'm actually here.

10:43.711 --> 10:45.412
Seeing you.

10:45.512 --> 10:47.647
I don't...

10:49.482 --> 10:50.884
I don't know what to say.

10:50.984 --> 10:54.121
You ruined my life,
you destroyed my reputation,

10:54.221 --> 10:55.756
you lied to me,
constantly, you...

10:55.856 --> 10:57.624
Oh, oh, now you don't
want to talk to me?

10:57.725 --> 10:59.426
I drive all the way down here,
you don't want to talk to me?

10:59.526 --> 11:00.527
That's really rich.

11:00.728 --> 11:02.295
I can't hear you.

11:02.395 --> 11:03.563
Wrong handset.

11:03.731 --> 11:05.733
Oh. Oh.

11:05.733 --> 11:07.234
Okay.

11:10.738 --> 11:11.638
Hi.

11:11.739 --> 11:13.206
Hi.

11:13.306 --> 11:15.142
You look... great.

11:15.242 --> 11:16.576
Thanks, so do you.

11:16.744 --> 11:17.878
A tie. Yeah.

11:17.978 --> 11:19.646
Uh, well, it's for work.

11:19.747 --> 11:21.381
I'm a professional
investigator now.

11:21.481 --> 11:23.817
You weren't a
professional before?
No, I was.

11:23.917 --> 11:25.252
I mean, we were.

11:25.352 --> 11:28.521
Our whole agency was,
but you clearly were not.

11:28.621 --> 11:30.657
Hey, okay, whatever.

11:30.758 --> 11:32.192
You know, I just
want to be very clear

11:32.292 --> 11:33.460
that I'm only here
to get information,

11:33.560 --> 11:34.762
and you owe me that

11:34.762 --> 11:35.996
for everything
you put me through.

11:36.096 --> 11:37.230
I could've ended
up inside there, too,

11:37.330 --> 11:38.932
so let's not talk
about who did what

11:39.032 --> 11:40.567
because you did it.

11:40.667 --> 11:42.569
You did everything.

11:42.669 --> 11:44.104
And you owe me.

11:44.204 --> 11:45.973
Yeah.

11:46.974 --> 11:48.441
Yeah, I do.

11:52.445 --> 11:54.114
Okay. Uh, great.

11:55.215 --> 11:56.649
So, uh, there's a journalist,

11:56.784 --> 11:58.151
Keith Baylis, he was murdered.

11:58.251 --> 12:00.954
And I want to know
if, um, Josephine Fontana,

12:01.054 --> 12:02.355
or someone
in her gang

12:02.455 --> 12:04.391
had anything to do with it.
Do you know...

12:04.491 --> 12:06.693
Joey? I know of her.

12:06.794 --> 12:08.628
Well, um, I need you to ask.

12:08.796 --> 12:11.498
Ask around. Ask her. Just ask.

12:11.598 --> 12:13.200
I can ask.

12:13.300 --> 12:14.701
Good.

12:14.802 --> 12:16.603
Why do you need me to do this?
Shouldn't the police

12:16.703 --> 12:18.238
be able to...
The police
have identified

12:18.338 --> 12:19.807
somebody else,
and they don't want to believe

12:19.807 --> 12:22.075
that the biker gang
had anything to do with this.

12:22.175 --> 12:23.811
This Detective Anten
testified that...

12:23.911 --> 12:25.012
Luke Anten?

12:25.112 --> 12:26.814
You know him?

12:26.814 --> 12:28.816
He's a prick and a liar.

12:28.816 --> 12:30.317
He is?

12:30.417 --> 12:32.820
He screwed up a case of mine
years ago, before you.

12:32.920 --> 12:34.054
He lied and said he had

12:34.154 --> 12:35.455
a confidential informant
in a case...

12:35.555 --> 12:36.824
Wait, wait, wait.
That's what he's doing here.

12:36.824 --> 12:37.891
That's exactly what he's doing.

12:37.991 --> 12:39.259
Yeah, it gets him
a search warrant

12:39.359 --> 12:40.560
every time, but those
C.I.'s don't always exist,

12:40.660 --> 12:41.895
and by law, he doesn't
have to reveal them...

12:41.995 --> 12:43.030
Who was your client?

12:43.130 --> 12:44.331
You get so excited.

12:44.431 --> 12:46.533
I forgot how excited you get.

12:47.835 --> 12:48.936
Millicent Granger.

12:49.036 --> 12:50.637
She's doing five in here.

12:50.737 --> 12:53.173
Okay, so Anten fabricated a C.I.
to get a search warrant,

12:53.273 --> 12:56.176
which led to the arrest of
your client Millicent Granger.

12:56.276 --> 12:57.377
You are a quick study.

12:57.477 --> 12:59.112
Well...

12:59.212 --> 13:02.015
Thank you.
This could actually be, um,

13:02.115 --> 13:03.483
this could actually be helpful.

13:03.583 --> 13:05.585
I'm glad.

13:05.685 --> 13:07.387
It's the least I could do.

13:07.487 --> 13:08.856
I'll talk to Joey.

13:10.623 --> 13:13.293
Visiting hours
are over now.

13:35.182 --> 13:37.584
Mom. Mom. Millicent Granger.

13:37.684 --> 13:39.352
Millicent Granger
of southeast Portland.

13:39.452 --> 13:40.954
I did some digging
into your case...

13:41.054 --> 13:44.291
Our case. I am the licensed
investigator on this case.

13:44.391 --> 13:47.027
And I am the 736 hours-away
from re-licensed

13:47.127 --> 13:48.095
investigator
who discovered

13:48.195 --> 13:49.762
that Detective Anten

13:49.897 --> 13:51.999
has a suspicious history of
using confidential informants

13:52.099 --> 13:53.901
to obtain
search warrants.

13:53.901 --> 13:56.269
Nobody could put Millicent
Granger at the scene of a crime,

13:56.369 --> 13:58.638
then Anten's
magical C.I. appears,

13:58.738 --> 14:01.174
giving him probable cause
to search her house.

14:01.274 --> 14:02.809
And guess what happened there.

14:02.910 --> 14:04.177
Found the murder weapon.

14:04.277 --> 14:05.178
It's the same story.

14:05.278 --> 14:06.546
Where did you get this?

14:06.646 --> 14:08.415
I think you mean
where didn't Lyle get this,

14:08.515 --> 14:10.417
and, uh, let's just say I have
my own confidential source.

14:10.517 --> 14:11.618
Can you trust this source?

14:11.718 --> 14:13.153
Yes. Yeah.

14:13.253 --> 14:14.521
Well, this might
be enough for me to file

14:14.621 --> 14:16.456
a motion to reveal
a confidential informant.

14:16.556 --> 14:19.026
And if Anten can't produce
that informant...

14:19.126 --> 14:20.994
Then the search warrant
is invalid,

14:21.094 --> 14:23.931
and the gun inside
Kathleen's car is inadmissible.

14:24.031 --> 14:25.498
Yes. Can we order?

14:25.598 --> 14:27.100
I am starving.
You guys want dinner?

14:27.200 --> 14:28.368
I have my dinner.

14:28.468 --> 14:30.203
Freshly washed
carrots and celery.

14:30.303 --> 14:31.939
What? What are you,
a rabbit?

14:31.939 --> 14:34.141
Well, at least share.

14:36.276 --> 14:38.745
Your Honor,
Detective Anten used a C.I.

14:38.845 --> 14:40.948
again in the case
of Millicent Granger,

14:40.948 --> 14:44.151
so I am filing for a motion to
reveal a confidential informant.

14:44.251 --> 14:46.386
I'm inclined
to give counsel time

14:46.486 --> 14:47.687
to prepare a written motion.

14:47.787 --> 14:49.122
The matter is continued
to Friday.

14:49.222 --> 14:50.357
Thank you.

14:50.457 --> 14:51.959
That's only three days.

14:51.959 --> 14:53.193
Is that gonna
give you enough time?

14:53.293 --> 14:55.228
Kathleen, this is
the break we needed.

14:55.328 --> 14:56.396
We should talk.

14:56.496 --> 14:58.098
Three days.
We have to research

14:58.198 --> 14:59.566
recent motions
of this kind.

14:59.666 --> 15:00.968
We'll need
a plan in case

15:01.068 --> 15:01.969
they do reveal
their informant.

15:09.576 --> 15:11.044
Hey, it's me.

15:11.144 --> 15:12.845
So, I spoke to Joey for you,

15:12.980 --> 15:14.547
and this Luke Anten stuff?

15:14.647 --> 15:17.484
Tip of ye olde iceberg.

15:17.584 --> 15:19.752
You know where to find me.

15:22.722 --> 15:24.691
So, tip of the iceberg, huh?

15:24.791 --> 15:27.527
Tip top. You need to find
a guy named Herb Mulholland.

15:27.627 --> 15:29.496
Herb Mulholland? Why, who is he?

15:29.596 --> 15:32.265
Evidence locker clerk for
the Portland Police Bureau.

15:32.365 --> 15:33.466
He was arrested by

15:33.566 --> 15:35.268
Luke Anten. Huh.

15:35.368 --> 15:37.004
And, uh, arrested for what?

15:37.104 --> 15:39.139
Anten said he was stealing
from the evidence locker.

15:39.239 --> 15:41.008
Stealing what?
I don't know,

15:41.008 --> 15:42.409
drugs, money, weapons?

15:42.509 --> 15:44.644
Just take a closer look
at his search warrant.

15:44.744 --> 15:47.547
I really think it'll
interest you and your...

15:47.647 --> 15:49.682
your current employer.

15:50.850 --> 15:51.918
Your mom?

15:52.019 --> 15:53.620
Who told you that?

15:53.720 --> 15:56.156
A woman in here. Celia.
Client of your mother's.

15:56.256 --> 15:58.458
Shot her daughter
Kim's boss to death

15:58.558 --> 16:00.560
on the roof
of a parking garage.
Yeah, I know who she is.

16:00.660 --> 16:02.395
Celia says that you
and Margaret have been playing

16:02.495 --> 16:04.797
"Bring Your Son To Work Day"
for months now.

16:04.897 --> 16:06.499
Yeah, well, I couldn't
get a job anywhere else.

16:06.599 --> 16:08.868
I lost my license, you know,
because of you.

16:09.036 --> 16:11.238
So, yeah, I'm working
at the firm as an investigator.

16:11.338 --> 16:13.640
Just talk to Herb Mulholland.

16:13.740 --> 16:15.742
Was I wrong
about Millicent Granger?

16:15.842 --> 16:16.943
No.

16:17.044 --> 16:18.711
See?

16:18.811 --> 16:20.747
I'm trying to make it up to you.

16:26.153 --> 16:28.288
Yeah, I know it's last minute.

16:28.388 --> 16:30.223
Okay, so you're cancelling
our make-up lunch with Mom.

16:30.323 --> 16:32.959
Fine. Great. I don't really
feel like seeing you anyway.

16:33.060 --> 16:34.427
Look, Allison, I'm sorry,

16:34.527 --> 16:35.428
and something
came up at work, so...

16:35.528 --> 16:37.064
What is that on your shit?

16:37.064 --> 16:40.467
Is that a visitor sticker
from a prison?

16:40.567 --> 16:42.302
Todd, what the hell
are you doing?

16:42.402 --> 16:43.970
I am helping Mom, okay?

16:44.071 --> 16:45.638
Todd! Don't lean on my car.
Are you out of your mind?

16:45.738 --> 16:47.207
You told me
that you were not
Okay, uh, uh...

16:47.307 --> 16:48.708
going to do this.
Lunch any other
day of the week, okay?

16:48.808 --> 16:50.410
How could you
be so stupid?
Bye.

16:50.510 --> 16:52.145
Wait, is that Mom... Does Mom
know that you did this? Todd?

16:54.647 --> 16:55.982
Uh, no, no, Todd,

16:56.083 --> 16:57.484
we're meeting Allison for lunch.
I know where it is.

16:57.584 --> 16:58.918
No, no, no, we're not.
We need to go

16:59.086 --> 17:00.320
talk to someone
named Herb Mulholland.

17:00.420 --> 17:01.854
No, we're not.

17:01.954 --> 17:03.123
I have only a brief
time for lunch.

17:03.223 --> 17:04.557
I have to work on
my motion to reveal.

17:04.657 --> 17:06.093
This will help with that.

17:06.093 --> 17:07.427
Herb Mulholland is a cop

17:07.527 --> 17:09.129
who was arrested
for stealing evidence,

17:09.229 --> 17:12.099
and he was arrested
by Luke Anten, and guess what

17:12.199 --> 17:13.566
Anten used to
obtain the search warrant?

17:13.666 --> 17:14.867
A C.I. Bingo.

17:14.967 --> 17:16.136
All right, let's go. Okay.

17:16.236 --> 17:18.571
Put your seatbelt on.
Okay, thank you.

17:22.142 --> 17:24.010
All right, let's just say
we're Jehovah's Witnesses

17:24.111 --> 17:25.745
or Church of Ladder Day Saints
or something.

17:25.845 --> 17:27.880
Okay... Wait, did you
just say "La-dur Day"?

17:27.980 --> 17:30.617
"Ladder Day"?
Todd, it's Latter Day.

17:30.717 --> 17:32.585
With a "T," "Latter."
Tuh, tuh, tuh.

17:32.685 --> 17:33.886
No, it's not,
it's a celebration

17:33.986 --> 17:35.122
of the ladder
they used to climb...

17:35.222 --> 17:36.656
Oh, he's here.

17:36.756 --> 17:38.191
Excuse me, Herb Mulholland?

17:38.291 --> 17:39.626
Hey.

17:39.726 --> 17:40.927
I'm Margaret Wright,
an attorney.

17:41.027 --> 17:43.130
Look, I don't need
a public defender.

17:43.130 --> 17:44.397
I'm representing myself,

17:44.497 --> 17:45.465
and I've already pled guilty,

17:45.565 --> 17:46.499
so that's that. But...

17:46.599 --> 17:47.834
So, please, just, uh...

17:47.934 --> 17:49.736
Excuse me.
You've already pled guilty,

17:49.836 --> 17:51.338
but are you guilty?

17:51.438 --> 17:53.140
Doesn't matter,
so please just go.

17:53.140 --> 17:55.242
Hey, Daddy.
Daddy, come play with me.

17:55.342 --> 17:56.276
Hey, sweetheart.
How about

17:56.376 --> 17:57.444
you go back
to playing,

17:57.544 --> 17:59.146
and daddy will be
right there, okay?

17:59.146 --> 18:00.580
Okay.

18:00.680 --> 18:02.182
Give me a dollar.

18:02.282 --> 18:03.550
What? Why?

18:03.650 --> 18:04.851
It'll make me your lawyer.

18:04.951 --> 18:06.619
She's a defense
attorney. The best.

18:06.719 --> 18:08.255
She's very good
at her job.

18:09.456 --> 18:12.359
And as my client, you can
confidentially speak to me,

18:12.459 --> 18:14.827
and, legally, I can't
share it with anybody.

18:14.927 --> 18:17.597
Listen, I appreciate it,
but I don't need your help.

18:17.697 --> 18:18.698
I'll be fine.

18:18.798 --> 18:21.334
You'll be fine going to prison,

18:21.434 --> 18:24.371
and leaving your little
girl without a father?

18:24.471 --> 18:26.573
I think you're just
trying to protect her,

18:26.673 --> 18:28.208
and I understand that.
I really do.

18:28.308 --> 18:30.510
I'm a parent, too.

18:30.610 --> 18:32.345
But...

18:32.445 --> 18:35.182
she needs you here, with her.

18:36.949 --> 18:39.319
Please, let me help you.

18:41.854 --> 18:43.223
Do I have to give
him a dollar, too?

18:43.323 --> 18:44.824
No.
Yes. What?

18:44.924 --> 18:46.626
Couldn't hurt.

18:49.929 --> 18:51.831
Drugs went missing
from the evidence locker,

18:51.931 --> 18:53.966
evidence in a case
against this biker gang,

18:54.066 --> 18:56.035
the Pioneer Ghosts.
I was told to

18:56.203 --> 18:58.738
shut my mouth
and look the other way.

18:58.838 --> 19:02.342
But I reported it
because I was a good cop.

19:02.442 --> 19:03.810
Next thing I know,

19:03.910 --> 19:05.745
I'm being arrested
for stealing a brick of coke

19:05.845 --> 19:07.280
that they hid underneath my bed.

19:07.380 --> 19:10.082
I mean, I got a kid.
I-I don't do drugs.

19:10.217 --> 19:11.851
You were framed.
It was retaliation.

19:11.951 --> 19:13.220
It most certainly was.

19:13.320 --> 19:15.121
For doing your job
and reporting a crime.

19:15.222 --> 19:17.357
Yeah, but it's my word
against the other cop's,

19:17.457 --> 19:18.491
so I'm screwed.

19:18.591 --> 19:20.727
And who was
the other cop,

19:20.827 --> 19:22.562
the one who actually
stole the evidence,

19:22.662 --> 19:23.830
you know,
the one you reported?

19:23.930 --> 19:25.965
Same one that
arrested me. Anten.

19:26.065 --> 19:27.967
Detective Luke Anten.

19:30.069 --> 19:32.239
Confirmed. Anten
is a dirty cop.

19:32.239 --> 19:34.040
He's been protecting
the Pioneer Ghosts

19:34.140 --> 19:36.676
this whole time.
And if he was willing

19:36.776 --> 19:38.077
to steal from
the evidence locker...

19:38.245 --> 19:39.612
Then he probably
framed Kathleen.
Uh-huh.

19:39.712 --> 19:41.147
So the bikers
could get away

19:41.248 --> 19:42.915
with murdering Keith
and stop his exposÃ©

19:43.015 --> 19:44.384
on them from
being published. Mmm.

19:44.484 --> 19:46.786
This will help with the
motion to reveal, right?

19:46.886 --> 19:48.488
Oh, we're way
past that now.

19:48.588 --> 19:51.157
We're going to clear both
Kathleen and Herb's names,

19:51.258 --> 19:53.293
and nail Anten
to the wall.

19:54.827 --> 19:56.929
Great.

19:57.764 --> 19:59.399
Okay.

20:00.833 --> 20:04.036
Herb, relax, we're just
going to tell the Judge

20:04.136 --> 20:06.339
that you're changing your plea
from guilty to not guilty.

20:06.439 --> 20:09.141
It's very simple, okay?
You'll be fine.

20:09.242 --> 20:10.477
Yeah.

20:10.577 --> 20:12.812
<i>State of Oregon v.
Herb Mulholland.</i>

20:12.912 --> 20:14.581
Good morning, Counsel.

20:14.681 --> 20:16.215
It's nice
to see you again.

20:16.316 --> 20:17.717
Let's get started.

20:17.817 --> 20:18.951
Please state your
appearance for the record.

20:19.051 --> 20:19.919
Good morning,
Your Honor.

20:20.019 --> 20:21.187
Margaret Wright

20:21.288 --> 20:22.855
for the defendant,
who's in court.

20:22.955 --> 20:24.824
We would like to
change our earlier plea

20:24.924 --> 20:26.626
from guilty
to not guilty.

20:26.726 --> 20:28.861
I'm sorry, uh,
this is a mistake.

20:28.961 --> 20:30.830
I'm not changing
my plea, Your Honor.

20:30.930 --> 20:31.964
I'm guilty.

20:32.064 --> 20:33.466
Wha... Wait,
Your Honor...

20:33.566 --> 20:34.967
Mr. Mulholland,
I want to confirm

20:35.067 --> 20:36.469
that you intelligently,

20:36.569 --> 20:39.772
knowingly, and voluntarily
entered this plea?

20:39.872 --> 20:41.841
Yes, Your Honor.

20:41.941 --> 20:43.242
I'm guilty.

20:43.343 --> 20:45.144
Herb, please, if we can just...
Very well,

20:45.244 --> 20:47.380
let's schedule
the sentencing hearing.

20:47.480 --> 20:48.381
I need a moment.

20:48.481 --> 20:50.249
What is going on?

20:51.884 --> 20:53.886
I found this right here.

20:55.722 --> 20:56.989
Oh, my God.
How did he get this?

20:57.089 --> 20:58.190
He was in my house,

20:58.291 --> 21:00.126
this close
to my baby girl.

21:00.226 --> 21:03.162
This is a threat, Margaret,
and I-I can't risk...

21:03.330 --> 21:07.133
Anten is not going
to get away with this.

21:13.773 --> 21:15.608
I can barely eat.

21:15.708 --> 21:17.243
I'm sick to my stomach.

21:17.344 --> 21:19.346
I can't believe
he threatened a child.

21:19.446 --> 21:21.714
So this Detective Anten
framed both your clients,

21:21.814 --> 21:24.351
Herb and Kathleen, to just,
what, protect a biker gang?

21:24.451 --> 21:27.787
I can't believe a detective
helped cover up Keith's murder.

21:27.887 --> 21:29.088
How did you know
Keith again, Chet?

21:29.188 --> 21:31.758
S.J.P.
You knew
Keith Baylis

21:31.858 --> 21:33.092
through Sarah
Jessica Parker?

21:33.192 --> 21:34.461
Society of Journalists,
Portland chapter.

21:34.561 --> 21:35.862
That's what I thought.

21:35.962 --> 21:37.163
Half the time,
Keith never showed up.

21:37.263 --> 21:39.532
He was always chasing
after a story.

21:39.632 --> 21:43.770
But when he did, we would
order him a cheese-less pizza.

21:43.870 --> 21:45.605
Lifelong vegan.

21:45.705 --> 21:47.374
It was disgusting.

21:47.474 --> 21:48.908
I wish you could
track down his notes

21:49.008 --> 21:50.410
or-or a draft of the story

21:50.510 --> 21:52.545
that he was writing about
the Pioneer Ghosts.

21:52.645 --> 21:55.181
At least then,
we'd have something

21:55.281 --> 21:57.584
that might connect
them to Keith's murder.

21:57.684 --> 21:59.386
Well, I'm sure he kept
his notes well-hidden.

21:59.386 --> 22:02.154
All successful
investigative journalists

22:02.254 --> 22:04.391
are super paranoid.

22:04.391 --> 22:07.560
Ah. <i>Et tu Brute?</i>

22:07.660 --> 22:09.629
Uh, may I be excused
for a second?

22:11.698 --> 22:13.900
Collect call.
Do you accept the charges?

22:14.000 --> 22:16.736
Yes, I'll accept the charges.

22:16.836 --> 22:18.438
Hello?

22:19.506 --> 22:20.540
Hello?

22:20.640 --> 22:22.141
Hey, I'm calling
to see how it went

22:22.241 --> 22:23.209
with Herb Mulholland.

22:23.309 --> 22:25.745
Oh. Um, you were right.

22:25.845 --> 22:27.313
It was, um... He was...

22:27.414 --> 22:28.981
Look, I really can't talk now.

22:29.081 --> 22:30.149
Then why'd you answer?

22:30.249 --> 22:31.551
I don't know, I just...

22:31.651 --> 22:33.085
I thought you might
have more information,

22:33.185 --> 22:35.121
but I-I really
can't talk right now.

22:35.221 --> 22:37.156
What is that noise?

22:37.256 --> 22:39.325
Oh, is tonight family dinner?

22:39.426 --> 22:41.193
Are you at your sister's
perfect little house?
No.

22:41.293 --> 22:42.862
Is her husband
wearing a turtleneck?

22:42.962 --> 22:44.464
Yes, but we're actually at
my mom's condo. Can you just...

22:44.564 --> 22:45.965
I feel like there's
a turtleneck involved.

22:47.099 --> 22:48.668
And Lawrence isn't there, right?

22:48.768 --> 22:50.703
He's off working somewhere.
And that cute husband of his.

22:50.803 --> 22:53.506
Chet. How old's their
little girl now?

22:53.606 --> 22:55.007
I remember holding her
as a baby.

22:55.107 --> 22:56.576
Look, I really
can't talk right now,

22:56.676 --> 22:58.911
and aren't collect calls
from prison like $20 a minute?

22:59.011 --> 23:00.780
Oh, my God, do you want
this information or not?
What's that about prison?

23:00.880 --> 23:02.649
Um...

23:02.749 --> 23:04.951
Tell me you were not
talking to Veronica.

23:05.051 --> 23:06.719
What-what is
going on?

23:06.819 --> 23:08.788
Uh, please? Allison?
Allison.

23:08.888 --> 23:10.757
It's just your idiot son,

23:10.857 --> 23:13.059
talking to the woman
who destroyed his life.

23:13.159 --> 23:14.193
Okay, um,
I can explain.

23:14.293 --> 23:15.762
Mom, look, Veronica is...

23:15.862 --> 23:19.632
What could possibly
possess you to...

23:20.967 --> 23:22.101
Oh, my God.

23:22.201 --> 23:23.636
She's your informant,
isn't she?

23:23.736 --> 23:25.071
She told you about
I told him

23:25.171 --> 23:26.639
Herb Mulholland
this was a mistake.

23:26.739 --> 23:27.874
and Millicent Granger.
I told you
not to do this.

23:27.974 --> 23:28.975
Yes, but I only went to her

23:29.075 --> 23:30.610
because she was
helping you,

23:30.710 --> 23:32.111
and can you please stay out
of this? You're not helping.

23:32.211 --> 23:32.879
We're just staying
over here, right?

23:32.979 --> 23:34.113
Yeah.

23:34.213 --> 23:35.548
Todd, I cannot

23:35.648 --> 23:38.651
have a known criminal
involved in my cases!

23:38.751 --> 23:40.252
Okay, but she is helping us.
Because of her,

23:40.352 --> 23:41.821
we are on track
to expose Luke Anten,

23:41.921 --> 23:43.490
and keep Kathleen and Herb
from going to prison.

23:43.590 --> 23:46.959
Because of her,
you almost went to prison.

23:47.059 --> 23:48.495
I thought you were
done with her.

23:48.595 --> 23:49.996
Oh, yeah? Just like
you're done with Harry?

23:50.096 --> 23:51.330
A legal separation?

23:51.498 --> 23:53.566
Come on, Mom,
just divorce that loser.

23:53.666 --> 23:56.202
I mean, talk about
somebody destroying your life.

24:00.172 --> 24:02.341
I can't even look at you.

24:17.056 --> 24:20.092
No, no, and a no.

24:20.192 --> 24:21.628
Kathleen,

24:21.728 --> 24:23.029
I know we've
gone over this before,

24:23.129 --> 24:25.665
but can you think
of any other possible place

24:25.765 --> 24:27.767
that Keith
might have left his notes?

24:27.867 --> 24:31.037
He was just
always so secretive.

24:31.137 --> 24:32.171
About everything.

24:32.271 --> 24:33.305
Who he met with, where he went,

24:33.405 --> 24:34.574
what he was working on.

24:34.674 --> 24:35.608
Maybe there's
a safety deposit box

24:35.708 --> 24:36.676
that you didn't know about?

24:36.776 --> 24:38.044
No idea.

24:38.144 --> 24:39.546
We barely talked toward the end.

24:39.646 --> 24:41.981
Maybe if he had just
put me first every now and then,

24:42.081 --> 24:43.349
we might've actually

24:43.449 --> 24:44.784
been able to
make it work, but no,

24:44.884 --> 24:47.887
it was all work,
all the time. And bowling.

24:47.987 --> 24:49.155
Bowling?

24:49.255 --> 24:50.322
Oh, yeah, took up bowling,
out of the blue.

24:50.422 --> 24:51.758
Joined a league,
the whole deal.

24:51.858 --> 24:53.259
I'm still paying for that
stupid locker down there.

24:53.359 --> 24:54.927
A locker?

24:55.027 --> 24:56.729
How often did he visit
the bowling alley?

24:56.829 --> 24:58.898
A few times a week. Maybe more.

24:58.998 --> 25:00.567
Are you thinking...

25:00.567 --> 25:02.301
I'm gonna need the name
of the bowling alley,

25:02.401 --> 25:04.003
and that locker number.

25:04.103 --> 25:05.605
Absolutely.

25:15.181 --> 25:17.483
Uh, hello.

25:17.584 --> 25:19.218
You are ten
minutes late.

25:19.318 --> 25:20.687
Oh, so you are speaking to me.

25:20.787 --> 25:22.388
I figured three strikes,
I was out.

25:22.488 --> 25:24.223
That's baseball.
I know that.

25:24.323 --> 25:26.593
Three strikes in bowling
is called a "turkey."

25:26.593 --> 25:28.394
Yeah, I know that.
Wait, how do you know that?

25:28.494 --> 25:30.162
And am I the turkey
in this situation?

25:30.262 --> 25:31.998
Yes. More like the Dodo bird.

25:32.098 --> 25:33.766
But right now,
we need to break into

25:33.866 --> 25:35.835
locker number 52,
which is right over there.

25:35.935 --> 25:38.638
Uh, I think your friend
Sergeant Security

25:38.738 --> 25:40.172
might have
an issue with that.

25:40.272 --> 25:41.708
Give me a moment.

25:41.808 --> 25:44.611
I will create a distraction,

25:44.611 --> 25:46.946
and then you can swoop in.

25:48.447 --> 25:50.516
Wait, you'll create a what?

25:59.726 --> 26:01.828
Hey, lady, what are you doing?

26:04.631 --> 26:07.233
Hey, this is our game.
You can't do that.

26:07.333 --> 26:09.168
What the hell?

26:09.268 --> 26:11.638
What are you doing?

26:14.306 --> 26:15.642
Okay.

26:18.377 --> 26:19.946
Thank you, Lea Luna.

26:20.947 --> 26:22.749
Okay.

26:25.284 --> 26:26.653
Thank you.

26:34.493 --> 26:36.663
Jackpot.

26:39.666 --> 26:41.000
Thank you.

26:41.100 --> 26:42.334
Whoa.

26:48.340 --> 26:49.676
Hey, what are you doing?

26:49.676 --> 26:50.710
She hit that 7-10.

26:50.810 --> 26:52.278
Hold this, please. Thank you.

26:56.048 --> 26:57.216
Oh, let's go. Let's go.

26:57.316 --> 26:58.685
I got everything. Okay.

26:58.785 --> 27:00.219
Also, since when did you
become such a good bowler?

27:00.319 --> 27:02.955
Your mother did have a life
before children, Todd.

27:11.063 --> 27:13.365
Okay, so, Keith is investigating

27:13.465 --> 27:14.600
the Pioneer Ghosts.
Uh-huh.

27:14.701 --> 27:16.168
He discovers
they're paying off Anten

27:16.268 --> 27:18.170
so he'll overlook
all their criminal behavior,

27:18.270 --> 27:21.040
but when Keith starts
digging deeper into Anten...

27:21.140 --> 27:23.710
He discovers corruption
inside of P.A.C.T.

27:23.810 --> 27:25.044
I mean, good God,

27:25.144 --> 27:26.813
it is not just Anten
who's a dirty cop,

27:26.913 --> 27:29.048
it is the entire task force.

27:29.148 --> 27:31.017
This must have been
a whole new story

27:31.117 --> 27:32.518
that Keith was working on.

27:32.618 --> 27:35.054
So the Pioneer Ghosts
didn't kill Keith?
No.

27:35.154 --> 27:36.923
It was the crooked
cops of P.A.C.T.

27:37.023 --> 27:38.725
that did it to silence him.

27:38.725 --> 27:40.226
Right, and it was
a high-profile murder

27:40.326 --> 27:41.961
of a prominent
investigative journalist,

27:42.061 --> 27:43.529
so they had to pin it on
somebody to cover themselves.

27:43.629 --> 27:46.733
And who better than Kathleen,
the "bitter ex-wife."

27:46.833 --> 27:47.834
You drop a weapon
into her trunk,

27:47.934 --> 27:50.369
and, bang, she's an easy target.

27:53.105 --> 27:54.640
Well, you got to admit,

27:54.741 --> 27:57.276
we only uncovered all this
by talking to Veronica and...

27:57.376 --> 27:58.911
Todd, I don't
want to hear it.
I'm just saying,

27:59.011 --> 28:00.780
we got her information...
Todd, it was

28:00.880 --> 28:02.381
a stupid thing to do.
There are plenty

28:02.481 --> 28:04.116
of other ways...
I'm just saying,
we never would've...

28:04.216 --> 28:06.753
Okay, Todd, don't just say.
Just listen.

28:06.753 --> 28:08.354
These are Keith's words.

28:08.454 --> 28:10.990
"The extent of the corruption
is outrageous.

28:11.090 --> 28:12.491
"They were taking bribes
from criminals,

28:12.591 --> 28:14.560
"making false arrests,
planting evidence,

28:14.660 --> 28:16.195
"entrapment, lying on the stand,

28:16.295 --> 28:18.630
skimming money
and drugs off the top."

28:18.765 --> 28:20.066
I mean, this is infuriating.

28:20.166 --> 28:21.300
We got to take
this to the D.A.

28:21.400 --> 28:22.935
Like now,
like right now.

28:23.035 --> 28:24.937
A dead man's journal isn't
enough to prove anything.

28:25.037 --> 28:26.105
We can't accuse one cop,

28:26.205 --> 28:27.506
let alone an entire task force,

28:27.606 --> 28:29.776
of corruption
without rock-solid evidence.

28:29.776 --> 28:31.878
Well, what qualifies
as rock-solid?

28:31.978 --> 28:34.213
We need someone to testify.

28:34.313 --> 28:36.182
Keith must have had a source,

28:36.282 --> 28:38.918
someone on the inside,
someone that he knew,

28:39.018 --> 28:40.586
like a cop at a...
at a police station.

28:40.686 --> 28:42.654
Okay. Or, I was gonna mention,

28:42.789 --> 28:43.890
it looks like Keith

28:43.990 --> 28:45.391
was going to
this barbecue restaurant

28:45.491 --> 28:47.894
in Beaverton called
"All You Can Meat"

28:47.994 --> 28:50.696
every Thursday
around 2:00 p.m. for weeks.

28:50.797 --> 28:51.964
What does that have
to do with anything?

28:52.064 --> 28:53.800
Mom, All You Can Meat?

28:53.800 --> 28:56.302
He was vegan, remember?
Oh, yes.

28:56.402 --> 28:58.104
Why would he be going
to the same place

28:58.204 --> 28:59.972
at the same time to eat nothing?

29:00.072 --> 29:02.909
Unless he was "meat-ing" someone

29:03.009 --> 29:04.944
in particular every week.

29:05.044 --> 29:07.980
Like... his source?

29:08.815 --> 29:10.282
Yes. You see?

29:10.382 --> 29:13.319
You are a good investigator
without Veronica.

29:21.193 --> 29:24.864
2:00 p.m. All You Can Meat
at 485 Pine Street.

29:24.964 --> 29:26.665
Need to identify
Keith Baylis's source,

29:26.833 --> 29:29.301
but that could be pretty much
almost anyone here.

29:45.985 --> 29:47.719
This isn't even the half of it.

29:47.854 --> 29:50.656
Look at this, case after case
of warrants and arrests,

29:50.756 --> 29:52.191
all tainted
by P.A.C.T.

29:52.291 --> 29:55.661
I knew Kathleen was innocent.
In my gut, I could tell.

29:55.761 --> 29:57.396
I don't know. I have to admit,

29:57.496 --> 29:59.932
when she said she fantasized
about killing her husband, I...

30:00.032 --> 30:02.468
Oh, please, everyone does that.

30:02.568 --> 30:05.537
I still fantasize about
pushing my ex off a cliff.

30:06.805 --> 30:08.174
That's how I knew I loved him.

30:08.274 --> 30:09.909
What about you?

30:10.009 --> 30:12.244
Oh, of course,
I'd never actually do it,

30:12.344 --> 30:14.346
but occasionally,
since Harry disappeared,

30:14.446 --> 30:16.916
and maybe once or twice before,

30:17.016 --> 30:19.185
I might have casually

30:19.285 --> 30:22.254
thought about an ice pick.
In the shower,

30:22.354 --> 30:23.722
where it would be
the easiest to clean.

30:23.822 --> 30:25.357
Are you sure you only want
a legal separation,

30:25.457 --> 30:26.658
because this sounds
a lot like...

30:26.758 --> 30:29.428
I am just not ready
to divorce him.

30:29.528 --> 30:33.132
And I'm certainly not
ready to kill him. Or am I?

30:35.267 --> 30:36.435
Come on, Susan.

30:36.535 --> 30:38.070
You've never
been so angry at Peter

30:38.170 --> 30:39.906
that you thought
about killing him?

30:40.006 --> 30:41.207
No. Angry, yes, of course,

30:41.307 --> 30:42.708
but not angry enough

30:42.808 --> 30:44.043
for an ice pick.

30:45.177 --> 30:46.778
Todd, though,

30:46.879 --> 30:49.048
I've fantasized
about killing him.

30:49.148 --> 30:50.516
Whenever he was annoying
or wouldn't shut up,

30:50.616 --> 30:51.617
I just wanted to

30:51.717 --> 30:54.286
smother him with a pillow.

30:54.386 --> 30:58.657
Careful. Todd's exes have
a habit of ending up in jail.

30:58.757 --> 31:01.127
Good point.

31:02.694 --> 31:06.365
What happened between him
and the one in prison?

31:06.465 --> 31:07.934
Veronica.

31:07.934 --> 31:09.401
I don't even want
to talk about it.

31:10.669 --> 31:11.703
Well...

31:12.939 --> 31:14.173
Years ago,
she helped him

31:14.273 --> 31:15.841
get his private
investigator's license.

31:15.942 --> 31:17.009
He was flailing...

31:17.109 --> 31:18.577
And failing, at life.

31:18.677 --> 31:20.947
And then he met
Veronica. Period.

31:20.947 --> 31:22.848
And she set him on a new course.

31:22.949 --> 31:24.183
She was
a veteran P.I.

31:24.283 --> 31:25.551
She showed him
the ropes,

31:25.651 --> 31:27.853
and she encouraged
his natural curiosity.

31:27.954 --> 31:29.755
And instinct for troublemaking.

31:29.855 --> 31:32.691
And then they set up
a small agency together.

31:32.791 --> 31:36.628
It was his true calling,
and he was

31:36.728 --> 31:39.231
so happy.
But the whole time,

31:39.331 --> 31:41.968
she was setting him up
as the fall guy

31:41.968 --> 31:43.435
for her own criminal activity.

31:43.535 --> 31:44.870
Forgery.

31:44.971 --> 31:46.072
Witness intimidation.

31:46.172 --> 31:47.073
Illegal wiretapping.

31:47.173 --> 31:48.707
So she framed him.

31:48.807 --> 31:50.376
Because she is a liar

31:50.476 --> 31:52.979
and a con artist,
and a sociopath.

31:53.079 --> 31:54.981
But Todd,
he couldn't resist her.

31:54.981 --> 31:56.348
He was like a moth to a flame.

31:56.448 --> 31:57.984
And he has his mother to thank

31:58.084 --> 31:59.151
for keeping him out of jail.

31:59.251 --> 32:00.552
The end.

32:06.025 --> 32:07.659
Wait a second.

32:07.759 --> 32:10.062
This is the third case
where the found weapon

32:10.162 --> 32:11.330
was wiped clean, no prints.

32:11.430 --> 32:12.999
Let me guess.

32:12.999 --> 32:15.401
A magical confidential informant

32:15.501 --> 32:17.103
sweeps in to cement the case.

32:17.203 --> 32:18.637
Just like Kathleen's case.

32:18.737 --> 32:20.306
But how is P.A.C.T.
getting away with all of this?

32:20.406 --> 32:21.640
Luke Anten.

32:21.740 --> 32:23.875
They hide behind
his golden boy reputation.

32:24.010 --> 32:27.013
They cover their tracks,
the insiders look the other way

32:27.113 --> 32:28.347
and enable him.

32:28.447 --> 32:30.316
And when all else fails,

32:30.416 --> 32:32.518
they silence those
who get in the way.

32:32.618 --> 32:34.586
It just makes my blood boil.

32:34.686 --> 32:35.654
Mm-hmm.

32:35.754 --> 32:38.124
But their days are numbered

32:38.224 --> 32:41.227
because we
are going to stop them.

32:41.327 --> 32:42.594
Okay, we're looking for someone

32:42.694 --> 32:44.063
working with
the Portland Police Bureau.

32:44.163 --> 32:45.331
So it could be a cop,

32:45.431 --> 32:46.732
a dispatcher,
a crime scene tech.

32:46.832 --> 32:49.501
Informants always look nervous,

32:49.601 --> 32:52.104
but inside,
they're strong, steely.

32:52.204 --> 32:53.339
How many customers are there?

32:53.439 --> 32:54.806
Uh, around 40.

32:54.906 --> 32:57.043
Okay, let's start by
narrowing the age range.

32:57.043 --> 32:58.244
20 to 60-year-olds.

32:58.344 --> 33:00.479
Okay, well, let's rule out

33:00.579 --> 33:02.114
the coddled
ten-year-old whose mommy

33:02.214 --> 33:03.715
is literally
spoon-feeding him.

33:03.815 --> 33:05.317
Good luck to
the future girlfriend

33:05.417 --> 33:07.353
who will never be able
to make him happy.

33:07.453 --> 33:08.420
And nix anyone else with kids,

33:08.520 --> 33:09.755
this wasn't a family affair.

33:09.855 --> 33:11.157
This is an adult, working solo,

33:11.257 --> 33:13.159
likely single, maybe lonely.

33:13.259 --> 33:14.526
Okay, that narrows us down

33:14.626 --> 33:16.362
to about a dozen
possible options.

33:16.462 --> 33:18.297
Oh, this guy
kind of looks like a cop,

33:18.397 --> 33:19.731
but I think he's on a date.

33:19.831 --> 33:21.800
A first one.
An awkward one.

33:21.900 --> 33:23.702
Oh, she's paying.
That's nice.

33:23.802 --> 33:25.504
Oop, nope.
They went Dutch.

33:25.604 --> 33:27.206
Yeah, welcome to
the friend zone, buddy.

33:27.306 --> 33:28.340
Wow. Well, if she's not smiling,

33:28.440 --> 33:30.109
this is also their last date.

33:30.209 --> 33:31.710
Yeah, she's not smiling.

33:31.810 --> 33:34.813
Okay, I think I should
focus on anyone dining alone.

33:34.913 --> 33:37.383
Hmm, I guess I did
teach you a few good things

33:37.483 --> 33:38.717
on those late-night stakeouts.

33:38.817 --> 33:41.353
Yeah, a few good things. Yeah.

33:41.453 --> 33:43.122
Okay, how many left?

33:43.222 --> 33:45.091
Alone? Uh...

33:45.091 --> 33:46.392
Five.

33:46.492 --> 33:47.626
All right, rule out
anyone with tattoos

33:47.726 --> 33:49.995
unless they're military related.

33:50.096 --> 33:51.863
Okay, down to three.

33:51.963 --> 33:52.898
So close.

33:52.998 --> 33:54.433
Yeah.

33:56.635 --> 33:58.537
College student is out.

33:58.637 --> 34:00.472
Well, you should tell her
grades don't matter.

34:00.572 --> 34:02.508
Yeah, it's who
you meet along the way.

34:02.608 --> 34:05.144
Okay, two left. Wait.

34:06.312 --> 34:07.946
High school
athletic coach.

34:08.114 --> 34:09.315
It's not him.

34:09.415 --> 34:11.450
Which means...

34:11.550 --> 34:12.518
It's a woman, isn't it?

34:12.618 --> 34:14.453
Yeah. I'll talk to you later.

34:15.621 --> 34:17.189
Hello.

34:18.524 --> 34:20.559
I think we have
a friend in common.

34:20.659 --> 34:22.161
Keith Baylis.

34:22.261 --> 34:24.130
But...

34:24.130 --> 34:26.031
he's dead.

34:29.968 --> 34:33.372
Suzi, you were Keith's source.
How did that come about?

34:33.472 --> 34:35.574
I work for the I.T. department

34:35.674 --> 34:37.243
at the Portland Police Bureau.

34:37.343 --> 34:38.810
I monitor documentation,

34:38.910 --> 34:40.846
tracking cross-communication
within departments,

34:40.946 --> 34:43.249
and inter-server constituencies.

34:43.349 --> 34:44.750
Okay, well, she's talking robot,

34:44.850 --> 34:46.152
so it's a good thing
you're here.

34:46.252 --> 34:48.254
What types of communication
do you track?

34:48.354 --> 34:49.455
All types.

34:49.555 --> 34:51.557
Police reports,
body cam footage,

34:51.657 --> 34:53.159
evidence locker logs.

34:53.159 --> 34:55.194
Emails between
members of P.A.C.T.,

34:55.294 --> 34:56.195
the special task force?

34:56.295 --> 34:59.265
Yes. I see everything.

34:59.365 --> 35:01.433
False arrests,
skimming drugs,

35:01.533 --> 35:03.435
planting evidence,
taking bribes.

35:03.535 --> 35:05.871
I wanted to report it,

35:05.971 --> 35:07.206
but...

35:08.174 --> 35:11.277
I was scared of
how they'd retaliate.

35:11.377 --> 35:13.179
So, you went to Keith Baylis.

35:13.179 --> 35:14.980
No, he came to me.

35:15.080 --> 35:17.183
He was looking
for an inside source.

35:17.183 --> 35:19.585
He was smart.
He knew someone in I.T.

35:19.685 --> 35:20.952
would have the info.

35:21.052 --> 35:22.988
And so he found me
at my regular lunch spot.

35:23.088 --> 35:25.357
All You Can Meat.
And he convinced me that

35:25.457 --> 35:27.226
it was the right thing to do.

35:28.494 --> 35:30.362
But...

35:30.462 --> 35:32.331
now he's dead,

35:32.431 --> 35:34.566
and it's all my fault.

35:34.666 --> 35:38.437
No, it's not your fault.

35:38.537 --> 35:41.207
It was the right thing to do.

35:41.973 --> 35:43.209
But now we need you to testify

35:43.209 --> 35:45.411
because my clients
are being framed

35:45.511 --> 35:47.346
for crimes they did not commit.

35:47.446 --> 35:49.215
But P.A.C.T. is so powerful.

35:49.215 --> 35:50.216
They kill people.

35:50.216 --> 35:51.217
I mean, what if...

35:51.217 --> 35:53.485
An individual is vulnerable.

35:53.585 --> 35:55.587
But with you, we would be four.

35:55.687 --> 35:56.855
And with Herb Mulholland
and Kathleen Baylis,

35:56.955 --> 35:59.358
we'd be six,
and there are others,

35:59.458 --> 36:00.959
people who shouldn't be in jail.

36:01.059 --> 36:04.129
We will stand together.
They cannot take us all down.

36:04.230 --> 36:06.232
This is so <i>Magnificent Seven.</i>
It's so awesome.

36:06.332 --> 36:07.799
More like <i>Yellowstone.</i>
What, the park?

36:07.899 --> 36:10.236
Boys, focus.

36:11.002 --> 36:15.006
Suzi, we cannot bring down
P.A.C.T. without you.

36:18.877 --> 36:20.412
I'll do it.

36:20.512 --> 36:21.713
I'll testify.

36:21.813 --> 36:24.350
But how will you
protect me from them?

36:24.450 --> 36:25.717
We work with the D.A.

36:25.817 --> 36:27.253
to put every single
one of them behind bars.

36:27.253 --> 36:29.888
We demand protection for you
from the state.

36:29.988 --> 36:32.023
And we gather all
the information that you found,

36:32.123 --> 36:33.592
the intel, the corruption,

36:33.692 --> 36:36.862
and we make it
very, very public.

36:36.962 --> 36:38.430
I happen to know

36:38.530 --> 36:40.732
another very brave journalist

36:40.832 --> 36:42.468
from the <i>Sentinel.</i>

36:46.972 --> 36:49.808
Story broke. Front page.
By Chet Venables.

36:49.908 --> 36:52.043
"The P.A.C.T.
Task Force has been suspended

36:52.143 --> 36:54.580
and is under investigation
for widespread corruption."

36:54.680 --> 36:56.482
We're looking
at it right now.

36:56.582 --> 36:57.916
And the D.A.
is right here,

36:58.016 --> 36:59.285
and she
just told us

36:59.285 --> 37:00.752
that an arrest
warrant for Luke Anten

37:00.852 --> 37:02.788
is being drafted
as we speak.

37:02.888 --> 37:04.823
So, I'm-I'm free?

37:04.923 --> 37:07.559
I'm free. You did it. Yes.

37:07.659 --> 37:09.928
You did this.
Thank you.

37:10.028 --> 37:11.897
Because of you,
P.A.C.T. won't be terrorizing

37:11.997 --> 37:13.164
the streets
of North Portland anymore,

37:13.299 --> 37:15.200
and we'll get justice
for Keith Baylis

37:15.301 --> 37:17.303
by proving P.A.C.T. was
responsible for his murder.

37:17.303 --> 37:18.537
And what about Herb Mulholland?

37:18.637 --> 37:19.905
Don't worry. He'll be fine.

37:20.872 --> 37:22.308
Wow.

37:24.543 --> 37:26.312
All charges dropped.

37:26.312 --> 37:27.413
What do you know?

37:27.513 --> 37:29.080
Yeah, Herb and Kathleen
are free,

37:29.180 --> 37:31.417
and the D.A. is trying
to put Anten away.

37:31.517 --> 37:34.085
See? You can trust me.

37:34.185 --> 37:35.787
Yeah, I don't know about that.

37:35.887 --> 37:37.155
Oh, you don't know.

37:37.323 --> 37:38.357
No.

37:38.457 --> 37:42.027
Well, I enjoyed
this little caper.

37:42.127 --> 37:43.595
Gave me something to do.

37:43.695 --> 37:45.130
And...

37:45.897 --> 37:47.866
I liked being in your ear again.

37:47.966 --> 37:50.569
Yeah, it was good. It was.

37:50.669 --> 37:51.803
But...
Felt like

37:51.903 --> 37:53.204
I was back out
in the real world.

37:53.339 --> 37:54.205
Free.

37:54.340 --> 37:56.241
But...

37:57.175 --> 37:59.978
...this has to be goodbye.

38:00.078 --> 38:01.447
I just wanted to look you
in the eye one more time,

38:01.547 --> 38:04.850
and tell you that you
nearly ruined my life,

38:04.950 --> 38:06.852
and I will never forget that.

38:06.952 --> 38:08.487
I know.

38:09.521 --> 38:11.122
And I'm sorry.

38:11.222 --> 38:12.991
I really am.

38:15.994 --> 38:17.663
But we do make a good team.

38:17.763 --> 38:19.398
Made a good team.

38:19.498 --> 38:21.032
But not anymore.

38:23.268 --> 38:25.437
Goodbye, Veronica.

38:37.683 --> 38:38.884
All right, I'm ready.

38:38.984 --> 38:40.586
All right,

38:40.686 --> 38:43.021
this cancels the request
for legal separation

38:43.121 --> 38:45.524
and nullifies
the service by publication.

38:45.624 --> 38:47.158
And this is your

38:47.258 --> 38:48.293
preliminary
signature pages

38:48.394 --> 38:49.695
for your
divorce proceedings.

38:51.162 --> 38:52.564
There, here,

38:52.664 --> 38:53.999
and here.

38:55.133 --> 38:56.402
Okay.

38:56.402 --> 38:58.604
This should get
the ball rolling,

38:58.704 --> 39:00.572
and then I am free.

39:00.672 --> 39:02.441
And no ice pick.

39:03.642 --> 39:05.411
I will get these
processed and filed,

39:05.411 --> 39:06.645
and we will
be on to

39:06.745 --> 39:08.013
the next step
by Wednesday?

39:08.113 --> 39:09.781
Thank you, Susan.

39:11.850 --> 39:14.453
And don't let this
sully your view of marriage.

39:14.553 --> 39:16.622
You are going to be
very, very happy.

39:16.722 --> 39:19.658
And your wedding
is going to be gorgeous.

39:19.758 --> 39:21.292
Thank you, Margaret.

39:26.598 --> 39:27.666
How do you feel?

39:29.067 --> 39:30.268
The same.

39:30.436 --> 39:33.171
Uh, less encumbered maybe.

39:34.640 --> 39:35.507
Hey... Oh, uh,

39:35.607 --> 39:37.709
am I interrupting
something?

39:37.809 --> 39:39.010
Yes.

39:39.110 --> 39:40.245
What have
you got there?

39:40.345 --> 39:41.613
Oh, uh, 49 signed statements

39:41.713 --> 39:43.081
of injury and personal
grievance records.

39:43.181 --> 39:45.016
The death trolley.

39:45.116 --> 39:46.552
Notarized, spell-checked,

39:46.652 --> 39:49.020
reprinted after unfortunate
coffee-spill incident,

39:49.120 --> 39:51.122
and ready to file.
All right, just
leave them there.

39:54.826 --> 39:58.163
Mom, I know you're
still mad at me about...

39:58.263 --> 40:00.599
We don't need to discuss
that matter any further.

40:00.699 --> 40:02.033
Look, okay, yes,

40:02.133 --> 40:04.069
there was a giant flashing
neon sign saying "no."

40:04.169 --> 40:05.504
Really? Where?

40:05.604 --> 40:08.273
No, like, metaphorically,
over my head,

40:08.373 --> 40:10.008
following me around.
I knew it was wrong

40:10.108 --> 40:11.443
to contact her, and yes,

40:11.543 --> 40:14.613
ironic to be getting help
from the person who...

40:14.713 --> 40:16.247
hurt me.

40:16.347 --> 40:18.884
She nearly destroyed you, Todd.

40:19.885 --> 40:21.152
Your whole life.

40:21.252 --> 40:23.455
But I had you.

40:23.555 --> 40:25.591
To protect me, helping me,

40:25.691 --> 40:29.160
and-and that's what
I wanted to do for you. Help.

40:31.096 --> 40:32.664
You need to make
smarter choices.

40:32.764 --> 40:33.932
I know.

40:34.032 --> 40:35.701
I thought you
were changing.
I am.

40:35.801 --> 40:38.103
I am trying.
I'm on my way towards that.

40:38.203 --> 40:39.638
I really am.

40:39.738 --> 40:41.940
And I am never going to see her

40:42.040 --> 40:43.875
or speak to her ever again.

40:43.975 --> 40:46.812
I promise you. I'm done.

40:46.912 --> 40:48.446
Okay.

40:50.081 --> 40:51.382
It's a good thing she still has

40:51.483 --> 40:53.852
eight more years
on her sentence.

40:53.952 --> 40:55.921
Come on,
let's get lunch.

40:56.021 --> 40:57.489
Really? I was like
99% certain

40:57.589 --> 40:58.690
you weren't
gonna ask.

40:58.790 --> 41:00.225
Wait, can we eat
at the bowling alley?

41:00.325 --> 41:01.392
They have
amazing corn dogs,

41:01.493 --> 41:02.561
and I want to
see some more of these

41:02.661 --> 41:03.929
sick bowling skills
you have.

41:04.029 --> 41:05.531
Sick? Why do you use
"sick" as a compliment?

41:05.531 --> 41:06.865
Okay, fine,
dope bowling skills.

41:06.965 --> 41:08.534
"Dope" is drugs.
Okay, insane
bowling skills?

41:08.634 --> 41:09.768
"Insane" is crazy.

41:09.868 --> 41:11.002
All right, you're
a great bowler, Mom.

41:11.102 --> 41:13.071
And you are not. Jacket.

41:13.171 --> 41:14.806
Oh.

41:18.944 --> 41:20.712
<i>Your Honor, the State of Oregon</i>
