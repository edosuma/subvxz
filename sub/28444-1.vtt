00:21.997 --> 00:24.632
<i>Rooney,
just brushes off Tomkins...</i>

00:24.634 --> 00:26.768
<i>Spectacular!</i>

00:26.770 --> 00:29.869
<i>Oh, what a goal!</i>

00:29.871 --> 00:31.838
<i>Hey, dweeb.
You see the Rooney goal?</i>

00:31.840 --> 00:33.707
Awesome.

00:33.709 --> 00:35.576
<i>I'm gonna be watching in
the flesh, mate, this Saturday.</i>

00:35.578 --> 00:37.013
Shut up!

00:38.012 --> 00:40.180
And are you really eating
what I think you are?

00:40.182 --> 00:42.715
<i>Yep, our usual mac
pizza pepperoni burger,</i>

00:42.717 --> 00:44.082
<i>my special breakfast.</i>

00:44.084 --> 00:45.250
<i>You want a bite?</i>

00:45.252 --> 00:48.087
Get lost, scum bucket.

00:48.089 --> 00:49.722
<i>Rachel's dad's away for work,</i>

00:49.724 --> 00:52.358
<i>so she's going with
me to Stamford Bridge.</i>

00:52.360 --> 00:53.858
Mia, you're
gonna be late!

00:53.860 --> 00:55.927
Coming!

00:55.929 --> 00:57.294
You're going with Rachel?

00:57.296 --> 00:59.163
<i>Don't tell me you're jealous.</i>

00:59.165 --> 01:01.966
You must be joking.
She's ugly.

01:01.968 --> 01:05.370
- Now!
- Coming!

01:05.372 --> 01:07.203
<i>I'll send you a selfie
from the Chelsea game.</i>

01:07.205 --> 01:08.774
<i>See you.</i>

01:25.656 --> 01:27.824
No, Mia,
don't do that.

01:27.826 --> 01:29.624
Like mother,
like daughter.

01:29.626 --> 01:30.659
Bye, mom.

01:30.661 --> 01:31.993
Bye, love.

01:31.995 --> 01:34.998
It's dangerous.
Why are you doing this?

01:37.635 --> 01:39.201
No fight at school.

01:39.203 --> 01:42.637
No talking back, and you
don't miss the test today.

01:42.639 --> 01:43.638
Mia, hurry up!

01:43.640 --> 01:45.008
Love you.

01:49.077 --> 01:50.780
The sandwiches!

02:34.686 --> 02:37.354
Get out of the car.

02:37.356 --> 02:40.356
Hey, hey,
where's my kiss?

02:40.358 --> 02:42.091
Good luck on your math test.

02:42.093 --> 02:43.459
Will you tell the vet

02:43.461 --> 02:46.027
that he doesn't need
his bottle at one?

02:46.029 --> 02:47.396
- I got it.
- Thanks.

02:47.398 --> 02:50.098
- Okay, whoa.
- Uh, buh-bye.

02:50.100 --> 02:51.300
Thank you.

02:51.302 --> 02:53.303
- Love you!
- Love you too.

03:18.258 --> 03:19.458
I don't care what
the problem is

03:19.460 --> 03:20.993
because it's your problem.

03:20.995 --> 03:22.494
This restaurant better
be ready on time.

03:22.496 --> 03:23.863
No more delays, Pete.

03:23.865 --> 03:25.131
No, I mean it.

03:25.133 --> 03:26.298
Hello there.

03:26.300 --> 03:28.703
What about this color?

03:29.335 --> 03:30.334
The other one.

03:30.336 --> 03:32.072
It's cool, no?

03:32.872 --> 03:34.074
This one.

03:35.375 --> 03:37.041
What's going on?

03:37.043 --> 03:40.244
Well, this building will
never be finished on time.

03:40.246 --> 03:41.879
We're still working
on the rooms,

03:41.881 --> 03:43.279
and we're nowhere near
being finished.

03:43.281 --> 03:45.017
- I'm not worried.
- No, you're not.

03:46.452 --> 03:48.118
Well, maybe you should be

03:48.120 --> 03:50.855
because we've got
another call from school.

03:50.857 --> 03:52.189
What is the matter with her?

03:52.191 --> 03:53.922
Well, you feel
lucky to be here,

03:53.924 --> 03:57.293
but you didn't when we
were in London, remember?

03:57.295 --> 03:58.927
You were dying there.

03:58.929 --> 04:01.164
Maybe that's how she feels now.

04:01.166 --> 04:02.765
Well, she's only
been here a month.

04:02.767 --> 04:04.234
Yah.

04:04.236 --> 04:06.001
She just needs a little time.
She'll get used to it.

04:06.003 --> 04:07.135
- I know she will.
- I don't know.

04:07.137 --> 04:08.302
She has no friends
at the school.

04:08.304 --> 04:10.339
I didn't either,
not when I was her age.

04:10.341 --> 04:11.906
She's a tough kid.

04:11.908 --> 04:13.442
Hey,

04:13.444 --> 04:17.481
if anyone can cope, it's Mia.

04:19.315 --> 04:21.281
So I got another
call from Mr. Kruger.

04:21.284 --> 04:22.986
He said you'd been fighting,

04:24.020 --> 04:25.186
again.

04:25.188 --> 04:27.157
Why do you always
believe Mr. Kruger?

04:30.358 --> 04:31.858
The kids here are morons.

04:31.860 --> 04:33.830
What choice have I got?

04:36.497 --> 04:38.964
I just wish your brother
could be more like you.

04:38.966 --> 04:40.200
Look at this place, Mia.

04:40.202 --> 04:41.499
Look at these
incredible animals.

04:41.501 --> 04:43.335
They're ours.
It's all ours.

04:43.337 --> 04:45.905
Do you have any idea how
lucky you are to live here?

04:45.907 --> 04:49.174
No, no, because I don't want
to live here.

04:49.176 --> 04:50.376
It isn't my home.

04:50.378 --> 04:51.979
It is now.

04:53.279 --> 04:54.378
London's home.

04:54.380 --> 04:55.947
That's where my friends are.

04:55.949 --> 04:57.347
That's where my school is.

04:57.349 --> 04:58.852
Mia.

04:59.319 --> 05:01.188
Mia!

05:23.440 --> 05:26.142
Tell me the story.

05:26.144 --> 05:30.879
Once upon a time,
on a dark and moonless night,

05:30.881 --> 05:32.180
there was a cataclysm.

05:32.182 --> 05:35.082
All of mother nature,
all the elements

05:35.084 --> 05:37.952
were raging so violently
that people thought

05:37.954 --> 05:39.387
that was the end of the world.

05:39.389 --> 05:43.357
The men and women watched
the disaster unfold,

05:43.359 --> 05:45.462
terrified and paralyzed.

05:47.029 --> 05:48.996
Only one man...

05:48.998 --> 05:51.030
A wise medicine man.

05:51.032 --> 05:53.100
The shaman of the
Shangaan people,

05:53.102 --> 05:55.271
the people of the earth,

05:56.404 --> 05:58.040
smiled.

05:58.940 --> 06:00.408
He was smiling.

06:02.344 --> 06:04.012
So people asked,

06:04.980 --> 06:06.612
"Shaman...

06:06.614 --> 06:08.446
"Aren't
you frightened by the chaos?"

06:08.448 --> 06:10.117
And he replied,

06:11.985 --> 06:15.187
"Humans have provoked
mother nature,

06:15.189 --> 06:18.289
destroying it day after day.

06:18.291 --> 06:21.228
So now,
she's taking her revenge."

06:25.097 --> 06:26.432
But one day,

06:28.467 --> 06:31.166
one Christmas day,

06:31.168 --> 06:34.406
a white lion cub will be born.

06:48.185 --> 06:49.318
Merry Christmas.

06:49.320 --> 06:51.489
And Merry Christmas.

07:06.535 --> 07:08.905
Oh, my word.

07:17.011 --> 07:18.376
It's a miracle.

07:18.378 --> 07:20.145
<i>Bonjour.</i>

07:20.147 --> 07:21.246
It is a miracle.

07:21.248 --> 07:24.250
It's a million to one chance.

07:24.252 --> 07:28.891
You know what this means,
my love, for the farm, for us.

07:34.227 --> 07:37.228
You see, Mia, a white lion

07:37.230 --> 07:40.902
born this very
morning on our farm.

07:41.633 --> 07:43.102
Here.

07:45.003 --> 07:46.272
You hold him.

07:47.739 --> 07:50.643
What do I care about
some dumb cub anyway?

07:55.646 --> 07:58.050
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

08:02.987 --> 08:04.322
He's so small.

08:12.296 --> 08:14.595
The tourists are
gonna go crazy for it.

08:14.597 --> 08:16.263
I mean, it's exactly

08:16.265 --> 08:18.399
the break we've been
waiting for, you know.

08:22.572 --> 08:25.205
<i>Sorry, up to my neck.</i>

08:25.207 --> 08:26.507
Can you talk now?

08:26.509 --> 08:28.478
<i>Later.
I'll call you, okay?</i>

09:01.808 --> 09:03.573
Do you want to
give him his bottle?

09:03.575 --> 09:06.176
No, of course I don't.

09:44.146 --> 09:46.380
Really? You spend the whole
day looking at me.

09:46.382 --> 09:47.514
Go find Mick.

09:47.516 --> 09:49.249
He's the animal lover.

09:56.723 --> 09:58.591
Hey, leave my ball.

09:58.593 --> 10:01.429
That's my ball, you know.
Leave it.

10:16.443 --> 10:18.275
Mick.

10:18.277 --> 10:20.777
I'm so sick of this fleabag
pestering me all the time.

10:20.779 --> 10:23.714
Hey, hey, hey.
It's not his fault.

10:23.716 --> 10:25.315
He likes you.

10:25.317 --> 10:26.650
You're lucky.

10:26.652 --> 10:28.419
Have some breakfast.
Jodie's making pancakes.

10:28.421 --> 10:30.352
Yeah, Jodie's making pancakes.

10:30.354 --> 10:34.723
Is she? How about Jodie make
pancakes half an hour ago,

10:34.725 --> 10:36.860
huh, Mr. Owen?

10:36.862 --> 10:39.128
And now, Jodie's
going to wash up.

10:39.130 --> 10:41.563
If you want pancakes,
make them yourself,

10:41.565 --> 10:43.100
if you want them.

10:44.701 --> 10:46.601
I saw that.

10:46.603 --> 10:48.569
Shush!

10:48.571 --> 10:50.239
You can have mine.

10:50.241 --> 10:51.807
I don't want your
stupid pancakes!

10:51.809 --> 10:53.841
That's enough.
What is wrong with you?

10:53.843 --> 10:56.310
What's wrong with me
is my bloody family,

10:56.312 --> 10:58.082
if you really want to know!

11:08.457 --> 11:10.525
Leave me alone!

11:38.851 --> 11:40.320
What?

11:44.924 --> 11:46.425
Ugh.

11:48.694 --> 11:49.829
Enough.

11:50.563 --> 11:51.894
Enough!

11:51.896 --> 11:55.766
Whining and crying
all day, bothering me.

11:56.800 --> 11:58.201
Stop it.

11:58.203 --> 11:59.804
You know, you smell a lot, eh.

12:00.871 --> 12:02.337
You drink liters.

12:02.339 --> 12:03.706
What's the hurry, boy?

12:03.708 --> 12:05.242
You're hungry?

12:19.321 --> 12:20.724
Crazy animal.

12:39.007 --> 12:41.340
And we need protein powder.

12:41.342 --> 12:42.975
Yeah, I know, Kev.

12:42.977 --> 12:43.976
I'm on it.

12:43.978 --> 12:45.543
Deworming pills.

12:45.545 --> 12:47.812
Plus Jodie needs
disinfectant for the pen.

12:47.814 --> 12:51.585
Kevin, I already explained
to you, we have no money.

12:52.952 --> 12:54.421
Whoo!

12:55.755 --> 12:57.287
Kevin, please come help me.

12:57.289 --> 12:58.958
Come on, Charlie.

13:00.260 --> 13:02.295
Look at those two.

13:03.862 --> 13:06.562
So you might,
you might have been right.

13:06.564 --> 13:07.830
It doesn't happen very often.

13:07.832 --> 13:09.299
You should break open
the champagne.

13:09.301 --> 13:10.937
Yeah.

13:12.803 --> 13:14.973
- Charlie.
- Thank you.

13:17.841 --> 13:19.308
Cheers.

13:19.310 --> 13:22.277
What are you doing?
Good boy.

13:22.279 --> 13:23.545
You're a big boy, Charlie.

13:23.547 --> 13:26.281
Oh, Charlie.

13:26.283 --> 13:27.686
You wanna play, boy?

13:28.852 --> 13:30.221
Come here.

13:31.021 --> 13:32.620
Who's a good boy?

13:32.622 --> 13:35.990
Champagne,
children and lions, good.

13:35.992 --> 13:36.991
And you.

13:36.993 --> 13:38.628
Yeah, and you.

13:39.528 --> 13:41.294
Come on, Charlie.

13:41.296 --> 13:43.062
Come on, boy, you can do this.

13:43.064 --> 13:44.063
Come here, boy.

13:44.065 --> 13:45.601
Come walk up.

13:46.934 --> 13:48.501
Good boy.

13:48.503 --> 13:50.336
Who's a big boy?

13:50.338 --> 13:52.441
Come over here.
Come on, boy.

13:54.007 --> 13:55.608
Good boy!

13:55.610 --> 13:58.009
Good boy, Charlie.

13:58.011 --> 14:00.879
Come on. Come on, Charlie,
you have to follow me,

14:00.881 --> 14:02.882
then we can do
everything together.

14:02.884 --> 14:04.253
Come on.

14:05.918 --> 14:07.554
Charlie!

14:10.590 --> 14:12.627
Come on. Come.

14:28.574 --> 14:32.942
Until this day, no one knows
where the white lion came from.

14:32.944 --> 14:36.678
But to the Shangaan people,
it's sacred.

14:36.680 --> 14:39.682
But one day,
they will come and help us

14:39.684 --> 14:42.453
bring peace to mother nature.

14:52.429 --> 14:56.033
Mia, it's not just a legend,
you know.

14:57.400 --> 14:58.898
You've got to believe in it.

14:58.900 --> 15:02.970
There are even people
who created a sanctuary

15:02.972 --> 15:07.706
in the Shangaan land next
to the Timbavati River.

15:07.708 --> 15:11.046
To welcome the white lion
when he returns.

15:22.922 --> 15:24.558
Thank you.

15:26.127 --> 15:27.693
- Mom.
- What?

15:27.695 --> 15:29.726
- Please.
- What?

15:29.728 --> 15:31.095
What?

15:31.097 --> 15:33.701
I can't
touch you anymore?

15:36.603 --> 15:38.034
Okay, you know he won't be able

15:38.036 --> 15:41.037
to stay in the house forever,
right?

15:41.039 --> 15:43.409
He'll always be a wild animal.

15:46.411 --> 15:47.610
You know that.

15:47.612 --> 15:48.845
Do you think that's true?

15:48.847 --> 15:50.980
Well, in Mick's world, it is.

15:50.982 --> 15:54.716
But a legend doesn't have to
be true to have truth in it.

15:54.718 --> 15:58.753
I guess each people have to
decide what that truth is.

15:58.755 --> 15:59.854
Can I read a bit?

15:59.856 --> 16:02.557
No, I want you to go to sleep.

16:02.559 --> 16:03.725
You've got school tomorrow.

16:03.727 --> 16:05.627
Go.

16:05.629 --> 16:07.898
Oh, no, no.
Oh, no.

16:09.466 --> 16:11.565
Oh, no, no.

16:11.567 --> 16:13.968
Charlie, stop!

16:13.970 --> 16:15.502
God.

16:15.504 --> 16:18.639
No, it's not funny, Mia.

16:18.641 --> 16:20.710
- What?
- No, it's not funny.

16:24.546 --> 16:26.480
Okay, bedtime, bedtime, bedtime!

16:26.482 --> 16:27.684
Go, go.

16:30.584 --> 16:32.153
Good night, Charlie.

16:33.887 --> 16:35.721
I never though I'd
hear myself saying this,

16:35.723 --> 16:38.924
but do you think she's
getting too close to that cub?

16:38.926 --> 16:42.661
Yeah, I know, but she's happy.

16:42.663 --> 16:44.995
For the first time we've
been here, she's happy.

16:44.997 --> 16:46.831
I don't wanna spoil it.

16:46.833 --> 16:49.100
What about you,
my little French princess?

16:49.102 --> 16:51.036
Are you happy?

16:51.038 --> 16:54.504
Hmm, yeah.

16:56.042 --> 16:57.807
Charlie, stop!

16:57.809 --> 16:59.075
Ah!

16:59.077 --> 17:00.781
Ow, Charlie!

17:03.082 --> 17:04.617
Charlie, stop!

17:06.851 --> 17:08.553
Are you testing me?

17:14.559 --> 17:16.959
I understand,
Charlie, it's fine.

17:16.961 --> 17:18.194
You're testing me.

17:19.127 --> 17:20.732
It's okay, boy.

17:28.704 --> 17:30.706
It's amazing what he does.

17:36.646 --> 17:38.512
Do you think we'll
be able to do that

17:38.514 --> 17:40.114
when you're all grown up?

17:40.116 --> 17:42.214
I'm sorry. That was something
my father used to do.

17:42.216 --> 17:45.652
We don't do that anymore.

17:45.654 --> 17:48.521
Why don't you try Dirk Duplasi?
He might be able to help you.

17:48.523 --> 17:50.059
Bye.

17:51.093 --> 17:52.857
What's up?

17:52.859 --> 17:56.295
I just wondered if you've
fed the adult males yet.

17:56.297 --> 17:57.766
Not yet.

18:00.600 --> 18:03.568
Come on, Kev. Mia's coming
with us, and she's gonna drive.

18:03.570 --> 18:06.139
- Ain't that something.
- Things change.

18:09.241 --> 18:10.911
Isn't it?

18:12.912 --> 18:14.181
You ready?

18:21.286 --> 18:23.719
How does the farm
earn its money, Dad?

18:23.721 --> 18:27.557
Now that is a
pretty good question.

18:27.559 --> 18:29.591
You realize we're
conservation, right?

18:29.593 --> 18:31.026
That's the whole point.

18:31.028 --> 18:32.328
Yeah.

18:32.330 --> 18:33.728
So does someone
pay us for that?

18:33.730 --> 18:35.097
- I wish.
- Huh.

18:35.099 --> 18:37.600
Scoot over.

18:37.602 --> 18:39.235
We gotta make it pay, you know.

18:39.237 --> 18:41.735
And that's gonna be our job
once the lodge is ready,

18:41.737 --> 18:43.138
bed and breakfast guests,

18:43.140 --> 18:45.607
film crews paying fees,
scientific research.

18:45.609 --> 18:47.975
It'll be tight, but we should
just about make it work.

18:47.977 --> 18:50.110
Then what about
the lions we sell?

18:50.112 --> 18:51.913
We do sell lions, yes,

18:51.915 --> 18:54.647
to zoos, parks, other breeders.

18:54.649 --> 18:55.849
What's all this about?

18:55.851 --> 18:57.553
I don't want you
to sell Charlie.

18:59.889 --> 19:02.589
He's not a pet, Mia.
You do realize that?

19:02.591 --> 19:06.158
He's not like the
other lions either.

19:06.160 --> 19:07.327
He's different.

19:07.329 --> 19:09.796
He's not that different.

19:09.798 --> 19:12.698
For now, he's a cub,
and you wanna have fun with him.

19:12.700 --> 19:14.736
Soon, he'll just wanna kill you.

19:19.039 --> 19:21.606
Go past this fence and
any one of these lions

19:21.608 --> 19:23.741
will tear you to pieces
in five seconds flat.

19:23.743 --> 19:25.610
It doesn't matter if you
fed them or bathed them

19:25.612 --> 19:28.113
or cuddled them,
if your name is Mia

19:28.115 --> 19:30.114
or Kevin or Obi Wan Kenobi.

19:30.116 --> 19:31.781
A wild animal is a wild animal,

19:31.783 --> 19:34.087
and you can never change
that no matter what you do.

19:37.089 --> 19:40.059
Well, promise me
you won't sell Charlie.

19:47.065 --> 19:48.964
Don't worry about Charlie.

19:48.966 --> 19:51.036
He's gonna be the biggest
draw this farm's ever had.

19:53.770 --> 19:55.839
Whoo!

20:01.811 --> 20:03.347
Woo-hoo!

20:16.725 --> 20:18.225
Don't get too comfy.

20:18.227 --> 20:20.228
Come on, let's go for a walk.

20:25.668 --> 20:28.101
So this place, it's your home.

20:28.103 --> 20:29.834
We belong here, you know.

20:29.836 --> 20:33.339
We belong to this place as
much as it belongs to us.

20:33.341 --> 20:36.645
You're beginning to
see that now, hmm?

20:39.013 --> 20:41.679
So that's the dad
and that's the mom.

20:41.681 --> 20:43.281
You know how you can tell?

20:43.283 --> 20:46.150
'Cause he's the one
acting like a fool.

20:46.152 --> 20:48.021
Come, let's go.

21:06.437 --> 21:08.270
You know, your grandfather
used to bring me here

21:08.272 --> 21:10.940
when I was exactly your age,

21:10.942 --> 21:12.678
in the salt heap.

21:14.178 --> 21:16.978
Cool, huh?

21:16.980 --> 21:19.013
See the baby hippo
standing on his mom's back?

21:33.361 --> 21:35.665
Charlie, I have to go.

21:43.137 --> 21:44.903
I'll see you in
two weeks, okay?

21:44.905 --> 21:47.740
You'll go into the enclosure
with all your friends.

21:47.742 --> 21:49.811
It'll be fun.

21:52.146 --> 21:54.912
- Are you crazy?
- Mick, give me a leash.

21:54.914 --> 21:57.115
It's okay, John.
It's just a scratch.

21:57.117 --> 21:59.953
- Dad, it's fine, really.
- Enough, Mia! Get in the car.

22:00.988 --> 22:02.190
Go.

22:03.891 --> 22:06.160
Put him away with
the other cubs, Kev.

22:43.560 --> 22:45.560
Mia!

22:45.562 --> 22:47.732
Out, please.
Thank you.

23:30.903 --> 23:32.970
When did he last eat?

23:32.972 --> 23:34.438
Yesterday morning.

23:34.440 --> 23:36.373
And he stopped washing himself.

23:36.375 --> 23:38.979
He just keeps knocking
against the door.

23:40.412 --> 23:43.078
So we can't feed
him ourselves?

23:43.080 --> 23:45.480
He won't let anyone near him.

23:45.482 --> 23:46.950
What about those scratches?

23:46.952 --> 23:48.584
Some of the other
cubs attacked him,

23:48.586 --> 23:50.953
but he wouldn't defend himself.

23:50.955 --> 23:52.621
Maybe he's just missing Mia.

23:52.623 --> 23:54.122
Oh, don't be ridiculous, Mick.

23:54.124 --> 23:55.524
Hey!

23:55.526 --> 23:58.028
Get that bloody
animal under control.

25:03.656 --> 25:05.154
Hello.

25:05.156 --> 25:06.955
Yeah, it's me.

25:06.957 --> 25:08.125
What?

25:10.060 --> 25:11.295
Since when?

25:12.996 --> 25:14.230
John!

25:14.232 --> 25:15.463
Get Jodie,
tell her to watch Mick.

25:15.465 --> 25:16.631
Wait, you gotta see this.

25:16.633 --> 25:18.299
It's Mia, she's run away.

25:18.301 --> 25:19.936
It is Mia. She's right here.
It's incredible.

25:20.636 --> 25:22.369
Oh, God.

25:22.371 --> 25:24.271
I promise.

25:24.273 --> 25:26.510
I'll stay with you forever.

26:03.242 --> 26:04.911
Where have you been?

26:06.112 --> 26:07.447
Who cares about that?

26:08.581 --> 26:10.517
What's the matter with him?

26:12.184 --> 26:14.251
What's been going on here?

26:14.253 --> 26:16.055
I'm sorry.

26:25.429 --> 26:26.996
I know you're dangerous.

26:26.998 --> 26:28.530
I know everyone says
you're dangerous.

26:28.532 --> 26:32.670
But would you really kill
someone if you love them?

26:36.140 --> 26:37.539
Please tell me.

26:37.541 --> 26:39.311
I need to know. Please.

26:46.416 --> 26:49.416
I can't imagine my
life without Charlie.

27:01.129 --> 27:04.462
Do you think that you'll want
to kill me in three year's time,

27:04.464 --> 27:08.971
when you'll be as big and
as strong as a big lion?

27:13.307 --> 27:16.540
Do you think you'll
forget who I am

27:16.542 --> 27:18.645
or even recognize my voice?

27:19.512 --> 27:20.982
Good boy.

27:23.215 --> 27:24.684
Come on, boy.

27:26.185 --> 27:27.786
Come on.

27:27.788 --> 27:29.189
Come on, boy.

27:52.209 --> 27:53.777
I love you, bud.

28:04.286 --> 28:05.654
Charlie.

28:09.859 --> 28:12.029
Do you love it, Charlie?

28:14.130 --> 28:15.498
I suppose so.

28:23.705 --> 28:25.271
Good boy.

28:25.273 --> 28:26.742
Good boy.

28:32.545 --> 28:35.049
This girl is soft in the head.

28:41.788 --> 28:43.287
No, she's not.

28:43.289 --> 28:45.289
She's an enchantress.

28:45.291 --> 28:49.096
She's magic,
like a fairy, like a pixie.

28:53.197 --> 28:55.731
You two are soft in the head.

28:55.733 --> 28:57.770
That lion will eat her.

29:12.450 --> 29:13.682
I need to sell more lions.

29:13.684 --> 29:15.284
Yeah, branch out
to some services.

29:15.286 --> 29:16.454
Thanks.

29:17.753 --> 29:19.823
What? Oh!

29:21.223 --> 29:23.924
No, get out!

29:23.926 --> 29:26.260
- Help!
- Mia!

29:29.765 --> 29:31.465
What are
you doing in there?

29:31.467 --> 29:33.303
Mia, get down here!

29:36.939 --> 29:39.439
- It's okay, Dad, I've got this.
- It's not okay.

29:39.441 --> 29:40.573
He's eaten the TV.

29:40.575 --> 29:41.707
And your supper.

29:41.709 --> 29:43.208
And he keeps going for Trevor.

29:43.210 --> 29:44.843
He's too big to
be in this house.

29:44.845 --> 29:47.246
I've told you, he needs to
be outside with the others.

29:50.751 --> 29:52.950
Get that wild
animal out of here!

29:52.952 --> 29:54.285
I'm sorry.

29:54.287 --> 29:55.920
- He's not a pet!
- It's fine.

29:55.922 --> 29:58.859
It's not fine, Mia. How many
times do I have to speak to you?

30:03.929 --> 30:05.462
Enough.

30:05.464 --> 30:07.667
He can't help it,
and you know that.

30:09.334 --> 30:11.904
He can if he tries.
Right, Mick?

30:21.947 --> 30:24.547
And folks,
what you've been waiting for,

30:24.549 --> 30:27.648
Charlie, our white lion.

30:27.650 --> 30:29.585
<i>The
Shangaan people believe</i>

30:29.587 --> 30:33.888
<i>by God to protect humanity
at a time of crisis on Earth.</i>

30:35.426 --> 30:36.791
<i>But others see the white lion</i>

30:36.793 --> 30:38.993
<i>only in terms of
cold hard cash.</i>

30:44.399 --> 30:46.369
Okay, guys,
just relax, relax.

30:49.438 --> 30:51.004
What happened?

30:51.006 --> 30:54.741
She was playing with Charlie
to entertain the tourists,

30:54.743 --> 30:56.242
and then he attacks her.

30:56.244 --> 30:57.746
She wanted to imitate you.

30:58.813 --> 31:01.414
Come here, boy.

31:01.416 --> 31:02.514
Who released
this bloody animal?

31:02.516 --> 31:03.882
Sarah.

31:03.884 --> 31:05.584
You've got to leave him alone.
Give him some space.

31:05.586 --> 31:07.920
He can't handle all these
people all the time.

31:07.922 --> 31:09.421
He's gonna have to get used
to it.

31:09.423 --> 31:10.722
This isn't a charity
we're running for him.

31:10.724 --> 31:11.957
That's all you care about,
isn't it?

31:11.959 --> 31:13.826
- Get him inside.
- Money, business!

31:13.828 --> 31:15.663
It's nothing serious, folks.
It's just a scratch.

31:16.962 --> 31:18.729
Kevin, take them
on the lion walk.

31:18.731 --> 31:19.896
I'll be right with you.

31:19.898 --> 31:21.031
Yeah, sure.

31:21.033 --> 31:22.499
Get out! Please, now!

31:22.501 --> 31:23.800
Come, folks.

31:23.802 --> 31:25.303
Get inside, Mia.

31:25.305 --> 31:27.505
- No, no.
- Inside.

31:27.507 --> 31:29.338
No, these are living creatures
and you can't treat them

31:29.340 --> 31:31.877
like some product you're
churning out of a factory.

31:34.445 --> 31:35.711
Don't ever speak
to me like that

31:35.713 --> 31:36.979
in front of our
clients ever again.

31:36.981 --> 31:38.681
The only way you
can help these lions

31:38.683 --> 31:40.048
that you care so much about

31:40.050 --> 31:41.683
is to make this place
work as a business.

31:41.685 --> 31:45.487
And you and that lion will
play your part in that.

31:45.489 --> 31:46.857
Now get to your room.

31:51.728 --> 31:53.027
<i>Mon amour.</i>

31:53.029 --> 31:54.896
Yeah.

31:54.898 --> 31:55.897
Surprise.

31:55.899 --> 31:58.366
I carry urgent bills to pay.

31:58.368 --> 32:02.437
And I bought 20 new sofas
for the rooms from Paris.

32:02.439 --> 32:07.640
I know, but if we want our B&B
guests to feel at home here.

32:07.642 --> 32:10.511
I guess they didn't feel
very at home yesterday.

32:10.513 --> 32:12.780
What happened to that trainee
could have been disastrous.

32:12.782 --> 32:14.314
Yeah.

32:14.316 --> 32:15.782
I've been around lions
my whole life, Alice.

32:15.784 --> 32:17.349
You can't be their friends.

32:17.351 --> 32:18.518
- I know.
- It's not possible.

32:22.791 --> 32:23.790
Oh.

32:25.627 --> 32:28.562
Would it be possible for Dirk
not to be your friend also?

32:35.034 --> 32:38.936
Oh, my God, John. She gets more
beautiful every time I see her.

32:38.938 --> 32:40.503
Hey, Dirk.

32:40.505 --> 32:42.373
You gotta get me one
of these French girls,

32:42.375 --> 32:43.840
you know, for me.
I'm serious.

32:43.842 --> 32:45.943
I need one of these for myself.

32:45.945 --> 32:47.547
<i>Bonjour.</i>

32:49.349 --> 32:51.451
Oh, <i>au revoir.</i>

32:52.083 --> 32:53.549
<i>Au revoir.</i>

32:56.722 --> 32:58.054
Dirk.

32:58.056 --> 33:00.393
Dirk, that's my wife
you're looking at.

33:02.894 --> 33:04.460
See, that's a compliment, eh.

33:07.732 --> 33:10.531
Thanks for sending
those people my way.

33:10.533 --> 33:12.601
But what's wrong with you?
You have a phone.

33:12.603 --> 33:14.068
Can't come visit?

33:14.070 --> 33:16.571
I told you, I'm not in
that business anymore.

33:16.573 --> 33:18.373
You're crazy, man.

33:18.375 --> 33:19.907
I need you, and you're up
to your eyeballs in debt.

33:19.909 --> 33:21.476
It's not about the money.

33:21.478 --> 33:22.712
I promised Alice.

33:24.981 --> 33:27.683
- What's wrong with you, man?
- Dirk.

33:29.751 --> 33:30.952
Okay.

33:32.554 --> 33:33.953
No one said Alice has to know.

33:33.955 --> 33:35.657
Goodbye, Dirk.

33:37.058 --> 33:39.557
Okay. Well,

33:39.559 --> 33:41.826
anything changes,
you have my number.

33:41.828 --> 33:43.661
Call me.

33:43.663 --> 33:44.932
Call me.

33:58.945 --> 34:00.114
Big boy.

34:00.881 --> 34:02.449
Big boy.

34:10.054 --> 34:11.858
What are you doing?

34:14.994 --> 34:16.728
Get it.

34:18.897 --> 34:20.132
Hello.

34:24.536 --> 34:26.067
Oh, God, Mia.

34:26.069 --> 34:27.935
Did Charlie do that?

34:27.937 --> 34:30.071
It's nothing. He just can't
control his claws yet.

34:30.072 --> 34:32.505
Okay, you know what?
He's too big now.

34:32.507 --> 34:34.743
You can't play with
him like that anymore.

34:34.745 --> 34:36.745
And you know what
dad and Kevin say?

34:36.746 --> 34:38.914
Stand up, arms out.

34:38.916 --> 34:40.581
Mom, he's fine.

34:40.583 --> 34:42.516
- I've got him under control.
- No, you don't.

34:42.518 --> 34:45.454
If you go down on his level,
he will think you're prey.

34:47.123 --> 34:49.690
Mia.

34:49.692 --> 34:52.891
Dad and Kevin don't know
what they're talking about.

34:52.893 --> 34:54.592
All those rules.

34:54.594 --> 34:57.062
Mom, you don't
think I know them?

34:57.063 --> 35:00.098
Never look in a lion's eye,
never turn your back on them,

35:00.100 --> 35:01.734
never let them jump on you.

35:01.736 --> 35:03.236
They're for lions
you don't know.

35:03.238 --> 35:05.503
But my relationship
with Charlie,

35:05.505 --> 35:07.539
it's not built on discipline,

35:07.541 --> 35:11.143
but it's built on
love and trust.

35:19.084 --> 35:20.785
Mia!

35:25.691 --> 35:28.191
- Is that how it's going to be?
- Yes.

35:28.193 --> 35:29.793
You drive me crazy.

35:29.795 --> 35:30.894
It's fine.

35:30.896 --> 35:32.164
No, it's not.

35:34.766 --> 35:36.967
- Mom. Okay.
- Be careful.

35:36.969 --> 35:38.671
There you are.

35:39.971 --> 35:43.239
Oh, my God,
look at your new dad.

35:43.241 --> 35:44.540
Go and get ready.

35:44.542 --> 35:45.641
For what?

35:45.643 --> 35:46.808
I'm taking you out to dinner.

35:46.810 --> 35:48.710
Dinner? Why?

35:48.712 --> 35:50.015
You'll see.

36:06.161 --> 36:07.226
<i>Come!</i>

36:07.228 --> 36:08.295
You look different.

36:08.297 --> 36:09.596
Shut up.

36:09.598 --> 36:11.034
Are you wearing makeup?

36:12.600 --> 36:14.034
You look terrible.

36:14.036 --> 36:16.805
Gosh, would you just
please leave me alone!

36:19.307 --> 36:20.943
Here we go.

36:31.985 --> 36:33.552
You remember this place?

36:33.554 --> 36:35.020
How could I forget it?

36:35.022 --> 36:38.056
I brought your mom here her
first night in South Africa.

36:38.058 --> 36:43.192
Okay, so the reason why I
wanted us all to be here tonight

36:43.194 --> 36:45.629
is for the first time
since we got back,

36:45.631 --> 36:48.232
we finally got more money
coming in than going out.

36:48.234 --> 36:49.966
Oh, that's good news.

36:49.968 --> 36:51.634
Yeah, I really think
we've turned a corner here.

36:51.636 --> 36:55.237
Oh, cool. That's great.

36:55.239 --> 36:57.809
I know how hard it must have
been for you to come back.

36:58.943 --> 37:00.212
Thank you.

37:03.314 --> 37:05.149
Why did we move to London?

37:09.319 --> 37:10.886
Your grandfather wasn't doing

37:10.888 --> 37:13.922
such a good job
of running a farm.

37:13.924 --> 37:15.822
The important thing
is your mom decided

37:15.824 --> 37:18.726
to give Africa a second chance.

37:18.728 --> 37:20.226
Who's the best mom in the world?

37:20.228 --> 37:21.896
Mama!

37:21.898 --> 37:24.599
Who's the most incredible
woman in the world?

37:24.601 --> 37:26.633
Mama!

37:26.635 --> 37:28.134
It's you, <i>mon amour.</i>

37:28.136 --> 37:29.169
It didn't cure you guys.

37:29.171 --> 37:30.904
The mama.

37:34.109 --> 37:35.841
Oh, God.

37:35.843 --> 37:37.612
John, he's out.

37:39.080 --> 37:41.113
Get the kids inside.
I'll call Kevin.

37:41.115 --> 37:42.648
Dad, I can help.

37:42.650 --> 37:44.749
- You've done enough!
- Dad, please.

37:44.751 --> 37:46.718
When are you gonna understand
he's not a bloody pet?

37:46.720 --> 37:48.287
He's worth a fortune, and
we can't afford to lose him.

37:48.289 --> 37:49.088
Now get inside!

37:49.090 --> 37:50.789
Taylor and Tbisu,
you come with me.

37:50.791 --> 37:52.089
The rest of you, get with Kevin.

37:52.091 --> 37:53.357
Head towards
the black gate, Kev.

37:53.359 --> 37:55.993
Make sure it's locked.

37:55.995 --> 37:59.130
Spread out, guys.
He couldn't have gone far.

37:59.132 --> 38:01.632
Hey, hey!

38:01.634 --> 38:02.799
Charlie.

38:02.801 --> 38:04.867
Charlie.

38:24.121 --> 38:25.656
Mia!

38:27.125 --> 38:28.359
Mia!

38:31.861 --> 38:33.861
- I can help.
- What are you doing?

38:33.863 --> 38:35.863
This is too dangerous.
It's electrified.

38:35.865 --> 38:38.098
They've put a
new padlock on it.

38:38.100 --> 38:39.833
You can't help me.

38:39.835 --> 38:41.934
Henry!

38:43.838 --> 38:45.007
Henry!

38:46.909 --> 38:49.208
Mick.

38:49.210 --> 38:52.080
- Come, boy!
- Mick, what are you doing?

38:54.848 --> 38:56.448
You look very
handsome today, boy.

38:59.287 --> 39:01.756
Would you mind opening
the gate for us?

39:12.065 --> 39:13.934
Very impressive.

39:16.903 --> 39:18.305
Thanks, Henry.

39:20.806 --> 39:22.373
Come on, what are
you waiting for?

39:22.375 --> 39:23.777
Let's go.

39:30.182 --> 39:32.148
- Charlie!
- Charlie!

39:32.150 --> 39:34.820
Shh! You don't wanna let
mom and dad see you.

39:40.056 --> 39:41.123
Charlie.

39:41.125 --> 39:42.357
My God.

39:42.359 --> 39:45.797
Charlie, boy,
where have you been?

39:46.864 --> 39:48.867
Has he caught something?

39:51.968 --> 39:53.133
No, no, no, no.

39:53.135 --> 39:54.938
He saved something.

39:56.072 --> 39:57.941
Hey, Mia!

39:58.842 --> 40:01.209
Mia!

40:01.211 --> 40:03.079
What the hell are you
guys doing out here?

40:05.246 --> 40:06.880
- Charlie.
- This is unbelievable.

40:06.882 --> 40:10.817
It's a water mongoose.
He's wounded.

40:10.819 --> 40:13.018
Go back to the farmhouse,
quick, both of you,

40:13.020 --> 40:14.520
before your dad sees you.

40:14.522 --> 40:17.323
Stop doing this!
We don't play with the lion.

40:17.325 --> 40:19.124
I've got him, guys.

40:19.126 --> 40:20.292
Yo!

40:20.294 --> 40:21.292
He's here.

40:21.294 --> 40:23.062
Come on, let's go.

40:23.064 --> 40:25.000
I'll nurse him back to health.

40:29.101 --> 40:31.101
Good boy!

40:31.103 --> 40:32.939
Good boy!

40:40.211 --> 40:41.779
Dad's asked you a hundred times

40:41.781 --> 40:43.212
to stay away from him.

40:43.214 --> 40:45.385
If he saw you,
he would be furious!

40:46.785 --> 40:48.021
Good boy.

40:50.455 --> 40:52.255
Good boy.

40:52.257 --> 40:54.157
This makes no sense that I'm
the one seeing a psychiatrist.

40:54.159 --> 40:56.095
You want some music, boy?

41:00.297 --> 41:02.465
Oh, yeah.

41:02.467 --> 41:04.168
You like it, boy?

41:07.037 --> 41:09.841
Even the lion's got
better taste than you.

41:11.073 --> 41:13.341
Want something else?

41:16.579 --> 41:19.113
No, no.
What a racket.

41:19.115 --> 41:20.146
No.

41:20.148 --> 41:21.784
Seriously, better taste.

41:25.086 --> 41:26.320
Traitor!

41:29.558 --> 41:31.794
Charlie, get down.

41:43.938 --> 41:45.003
Here, Charlie.

41:45.005 --> 41:47.439
Mick, you know you can,

41:47.441 --> 41:49.173
you can come in if you want.

41:49.175 --> 41:51.442
I mean, you can trust him.

41:51.444 --> 41:53.244
He won't hurt you.

41:53.246 --> 41:55.048
He's known you
since he was born.

41:57.516 --> 41:59.049
He won't hurt you.

41:59.051 --> 42:01.284
The only danger is
if you're afraid.

42:01.286 --> 42:03.856
- Are you sure?
- It's okay. Trust me.

42:16.199 --> 42:19.134
Good boy. You can come to him.
It's fine.

42:19.136 --> 42:20.938
You're not a threat or a prey.

42:21.639 --> 42:23.375
Part of the pride.

42:26.043 --> 42:27.941
Mia, what are you doing?

42:27.943 --> 42:29.176
Mick, get out now!

42:29.178 --> 42:30.211
Both of you, now!

42:30.213 --> 42:32.013
John, bring the gun.

42:32.015 --> 42:34.015
Mom, there's nothing to
worry about. Everything's fine.

42:34.017 --> 42:36.149
John. John!

42:36.151 --> 42:37.551
It's fine.

42:37.553 --> 42:39.186
Mick, Mia, get out of there.

42:39.188 --> 42:41.023
Now!

42:42.358 --> 42:44.460
- Ah!
- Mick!

42:45.360 --> 42:48.061
Mick. Mick.

42:48.063 --> 42:49.228
Mama.

42:52.133 --> 42:53.935
Mama.

43:09.615 --> 43:10.985
Thank you.

43:13.353 --> 43:15.321
It has to stop, Mia.

43:17.189 --> 43:19.993
I'm tired of being
scared all the time.

43:25.397 --> 43:28.199
I forbid you to approach
this lion ever again.

43:29.200 --> 43:31.136
But mom, it was not his fault.

43:32.070 --> 43:33.068
You did this.

43:33.070 --> 43:34.570
Excuse me.

43:34.572 --> 43:36.639
What are you talking about?

43:36.641 --> 43:38.510
Mia, look at me.

43:39.342 --> 43:41.310
Mia!

43:41.312 --> 43:43.377
What more do you want?

43:43.379 --> 43:45.182
He almost killed him.

43:47.384 --> 43:49.650
I've let it go way
too far with this lion.

43:49.652 --> 43:51.584
He has to go.

43:51.586 --> 43:52.954
No, Dad, please.

43:52.956 --> 43:54.055
Please, I'll do anything.

43:54.057 --> 43:55.626
Enough, Mia! It's over.

43:58.026 --> 43:59.993
This is gonna be
catastrophic for this farm,

43:59.995 --> 44:01.398
but it's decided.

44:06.034 --> 44:07.666
- Thanks, doctor.
- Thanks very much.

44:07.668 --> 44:09.205
I will see you tomorrow.

44:14.208 --> 44:17.109
She won't accept it.

44:17.111 --> 44:19.278
It's gonna break her heart.

44:19.280 --> 44:21.015
You know that.

44:22.015 --> 44:23.151
I know.

44:30.322 --> 44:32.556
From now on,
that lion stays in its pen,

44:32.558 --> 44:34.928
and you stay outside.
Do you understand?

44:38.498 --> 44:41.397
This is your last chance.

44:41.399 --> 44:43.667
If you disobey us again,
I will sell Charlie.

44:43.669 --> 44:46.502
Understood?

44:46.504 --> 44:48.540
No one enters that
pen ever again.

44:50.308 --> 44:51.576
Ever!

45:13.163 --> 45:14.732
I love you, my sweetheart.

45:16.132 --> 45:18.465
Hey.

45:18.467 --> 45:20.269
You just have to trust me.

45:24.639 --> 45:27.709
Hey, he'll get better.
I promise.

45:39.787 --> 45:42.256
I know you didn't mean it.
It was my fault.

45:43.090 --> 45:44.789
Yeah.

45:44.791 --> 45:47.526
One day, I'm going to get
you to Timbavati River Reserve.

45:47.528 --> 45:51.561
I don't know how yet,
but I'm gonna do it.

45:51.563 --> 45:54.368
Charlie, I promise,
and then you'll be free.

45:55.167 --> 45:56.402
Here, here.

46:25.628 --> 46:27.127
<i>Mick, over here.</i>

46:27.129 --> 46:29.165
<i>Smile, baby.</i>

46:31.200 --> 46:34.167
Mick and Dad.

46:34.169 --> 46:35.336
<i>Touch it, Mick.</i>

46:35.338 --> 46:38.205
<i>There we go.</i>

46:38.207 --> 46:41.775
<i>See, he's happy to meet you.</i>

46:52.486 --> 46:54.055
How'd it go?

47:00.694 --> 47:02.760
- Did something happen?
- No, nothing happened.

47:02.762 --> 47:05.396
We just, we had a new doctor
and he told me what to do.

47:05.398 --> 47:06.597
That's it.

47:06.599 --> 47:07.865
What did the new guy say?

47:07.867 --> 47:09.601
Mia, can we talk
about this later?

47:09.603 --> 47:11.235
When exactly?

47:11.237 --> 47:12.669
Please.

47:12.671 --> 47:15.205
He's my brother.
You never talk to me about this.

47:15.207 --> 47:16.475
Not now.

47:21.747 --> 47:23.647
Need a hand with the feeds?

47:23.649 --> 47:24.784
Go away.

47:27.151 --> 47:28.653
Things change, Mick.

47:30.722 --> 47:32.821
- It won't always be like this.
- It will for me.

47:32.823 --> 47:34.390
It won't.

47:34.392 --> 47:38.726
I've seen you as a baby,
happy and so carefree.

47:38.728 --> 47:40.462
Look at me now.

47:40.464 --> 47:42.531
I have panic attacks.

47:42.533 --> 47:45.433
I have nightmares.

47:45.435 --> 47:46.801
I'm two years older than you

47:46.803 --> 47:48.436
and I still sleep with
a bloody nightlight.

47:48.438 --> 47:49.770
That's not your fault.

47:49.772 --> 47:51.272
What difference does it
make whose fault it is?

47:51.274 --> 47:52.539
That is not true!

47:52.541 --> 47:54.408
Look at all these animals.

47:54.410 --> 47:56.910
They'd all be dead
if it wasn't for you.

47:56.912 --> 48:01.347
I'm 15 years old, and they're
the only friends I've got.

48:01.349 --> 48:02.748
It's pathetic.

48:02.750 --> 48:04.250
You said it yourself.

48:04.252 --> 48:06.219
Because I'm an idiot.

48:06.221 --> 48:08.320
Come with me.
I want to show you something.

48:08.322 --> 48:09.422
Mm-mm.

48:09.424 --> 48:10.857
Mick, please.

48:10.859 --> 48:13.228
I mean it.
I want to show you something.

48:13.828 --> 48:15.694
Fine.

48:23.470 --> 48:25.173
Come on, please.

48:26.739 --> 48:28.175
No.

48:29.474 --> 48:31.441
You want to know my secret?

48:31.443 --> 48:32.679
Well, this is it.

48:35.248 --> 48:37.150
Come.

48:45.357 --> 48:49.658
You were right to believe
in the legend, Mick.

48:49.660 --> 48:52.864
It's all true because there's
something special about Charlie.

49:24.459 --> 49:26.625
Dad doesn't know
anything about this.

49:26.627 --> 49:29.962
Charlie's my best friend.
I just couldn't let him go.

49:29.964 --> 49:32.565
I've come to see him everyday
since he's been put here.

49:32.567 --> 49:36.569
And maybe one day,
when Charlie's free,

49:36.571 --> 49:38.471
you will be too,

49:38.473 --> 49:40.638
because that's what
the legend says, right?

49:40.640 --> 49:42.309
That he's come to save us all.

49:49.916 --> 49:52.418
Good boy.
Good boy.

50:17.007 --> 50:18.306
Jodie, enough!

50:21.945 --> 50:23.948
Mia, I'm using your phone.

50:25.616 --> 50:27.080
Get him.
Get him.

50:27.082 --> 50:29.683
That's unfair.

50:29.685 --> 50:31.454
Smile, you lunatics.

50:31.988 --> 50:34.855
Smile.

50:34.857 --> 50:36.723
<i>Dad doesn't
know anything about this.</i>

50:36.725 --> 50:38.657
<i>Charlie's my best friend.</i>

50:38.659 --> 50:40.827
<i>I just couldn't let him go.</i>

50:40.829 --> 50:44.934
<i>I've come to see him everyday
since he's been put here.</i>

50:49.438 --> 50:52.770
He's gonna be sold to
the first buyer I can find.

50:52.772 --> 50:54.073
Don't do that, Mr. Owen.

50:54.075 --> 50:58.009
Don't tell me what to do.

50:58.011 --> 51:00.478
- Kevin!
- Yes, John?

51:00.480 --> 51:03.416
I want you to move Charlie and
get his transfer papers ready.

51:14.692 --> 51:16.859
No, no, no!

51:16.861 --> 51:17.993
Hey, hey, hey!

51:17.995 --> 51:20.364
Enough.
Stop it, stop it.

51:20.366 --> 51:21.498
Enough.

51:21.500 --> 51:22.799
Stop it.

51:22.801 --> 51:24.734
He'll be fine
in a park or a zoo.

51:24.736 --> 51:26.501
- He'll be looked after.
- But not by me.

52:05.607 --> 52:07.907
I've messed up, Charlie.

52:07.909 --> 52:09.141
I ruined everything.

52:09.143 --> 52:11.076
But you mustn't be scared

52:11.078 --> 52:14.479
'cause I'm gonna find
out where dad sends you.

52:14.481 --> 52:16.551
I'll come and get you.

52:18.651 --> 52:20.020
Charlie, I promise.

52:56.487 --> 52:57.852
We lost her.

52:57.854 --> 52:59.655
The gun missed
the tiger completely.

52:59.657 --> 53:03.558
Hits Frank in the thigh
with the tranquilizer dart.

53:03.560 --> 53:05.725
He's lucky to be alive, huh?

53:05.727 --> 53:08.531
I haven't laughed
so much in years.

53:14.069 --> 53:16.035
Nice shot.

53:16.037 --> 53:17.907
Let's go, guys.

53:24.912 --> 53:26.781
- He's good.
- Okay, come.

53:37.190 --> 53:38.823
Thanks for the help, man.

53:38.825 --> 53:41.162
Frank will be recuperated
in a couple of days.

53:51.603 --> 53:53.237
I'll show you how
to shoot the bow.

53:53.239 --> 53:55.605
Get a nice comfortable
grip on the bow.

53:55.607 --> 53:57.543
You have your clipper.

54:10.588 --> 54:11.988
- What's your name again?
- Chuck.

54:11.990 --> 54:13.555
Yeah, Chuck.
Okay, step aside.

54:13.557 --> 54:15.155
<i>Bonjour, madam.</i>

54:15.157 --> 54:16.925
Your lioness has arrived.

54:16.927 --> 54:18.162
Good luck.

54:25.067 --> 54:27.768
Johnny, you came to see
some of the action, eh.

54:27.770 --> 54:29.169
You know I want nothing
to do with this shit.

54:29.171 --> 54:30.270
I'm helping Tiance today.

54:30.272 --> 54:32.540
Yet, you are here.

54:32.542 --> 54:34.944
It's nice to have you back,
my buddy.

54:45.586 --> 54:48.757
That white lion of yours
is gonna make us very rich.

54:52.158 --> 54:53.991
I'm not delivering
anything to you.

54:53.993 --> 54:56.562
I'll take the lion to
the farm and that's it.

54:56.564 --> 54:58.730
You tell yourself
whatever you want to,

54:58.732 --> 55:00.098
whatever you need
to tell yourself

55:00.100 --> 55:01.699
to go to bed at
night and sleep well.

55:01.701 --> 55:03.300
You can tell yourself that.

55:03.302 --> 55:05.068
I just want you to consider
one thing, just consider it.

55:05.070 --> 55:07.738
How do you think that loan
of yours got green lit, hmm?

55:07.740 --> 55:10.274
Me.

55:10.276 --> 55:13.247
Stick to the deal or you're
gonna lose everything.

55:18.150 --> 55:20.784
Just tell me when.

55:20.786 --> 55:21.884
48 hours.

55:21.886 --> 55:23.185
48 hours, eh, John-o.

55:23.187 --> 55:25.657
White lion, 48 hours.

55:54.048 --> 55:55.915
I got it!

56:00.222 --> 56:01.622
She's still moving.

56:01.624 --> 56:03.021
Not in the head, you idiot.

56:03.023 --> 56:04.824
You'll spoil my trophy.

56:06.994 --> 56:08.697
Good shot, bookie.

56:27.045 --> 56:30.113
<i>But where do these
lions come from?</i>

56:30.115 --> 56:34.717
<i>The vast majority obtain
animals bred on national farms.</i>

56:34.719 --> 56:37.854
Hey, I've been calling
you for 20 minutes.

56:37.856 --> 56:39.290
Please, come on.

56:45.930 --> 56:47.929
- This really worked.
- Yeah.

56:47.931 --> 56:49.899
Just because of
the amount of love

56:49.901 --> 56:52.066
- that you put into growing.
- Of course.

56:52.068 --> 56:54.302
So open a restaurant.

56:54.304 --> 56:55.369
Hmm?

56:55.371 --> 56:56.872
Cooking some carrots.

56:56.874 --> 56:58.173
The kids can help
me grow the veggies.

56:58.175 --> 56:59.273
Only carrots.

56:59.275 --> 57:00.776
Should I?

57:00.778 --> 57:03.310
Mia, should I do that?

57:03.312 --> 57:05.047
You're not hungry?

57:06.882 --> 57:08.919
What? Mia!

57:10.453 --> 57:12.155
I'll take care of it.

57:24.865 --> 57:26.331
What's wrong, Mia?

57:26.333 --> 57:28.937
Dad doesn't sell
the lions to zoos.

57:31.337 --> 57:33.408
He sells them to hunters.

57:35.275 --> 57:36.775
No.

57:36.777 --> 57:39.010
All the adult lions that
leave here are killed,

57:39.012 --> 57:41.712
shot in cold blood
in an enclosure.

57:41.714 --> 57:43.347
That's what our farm does.

57:43.349 --> 57:44.981
We don't save anything.

57:44.983 --> 57:46.184
We don't protect nature.

57:46.186 --> 57:48.386
We destroy it, for money.

57:48.388 --> 57:50.253
Dad wouldn't do that.

57:50.255 --> 57:51.722
I saw him do it.

57:51.724 --> 57:53.389
How do you think
I know all this?

57:53.391 --> 57:56.092
Besides, it's actually legal.

57:56.094 --> 57:57.427
I saw that on the internet.

57:57.429 --> 57:59.195
He lies to the tourists.

57:59.197 --> 58:01.465
It's just a cover for
the breeding side of things.

58:01.467 --> 58:03.765
All the farm owners
know what goes on

58:03.767 --> 58:05.767
but no one speaks
out against it.

58:05.769 --> 58:08.504
The workers either keep their
mouths shut or they're fired.

58:08.506 --> 58:10.839
Stop it. Stop it.

58:10.841 --> 58:12.241
Mick, Mick, no.

58:12.243 --> 58:14.074
You have to know.

58:14.076 --> 58:17.345
Please, you're the only one
I can talk to about this.

58:17.347 --> 58:19.246
I can't trust dad,

58:19.248 --> 58:22.016
and I have no idea what
mom knows or thinks.

58:22.018 --> 58:25.954
And if I say something
and she sides with dad,

58:25.956 --> 58:28.221
then it will be too
late to save Charlie.

58:28.223 --> 58:30.089
Save him?

58:30.091 --> 58:31.727
He's next.

58:33.261 --> 58:37.864
I need to get him to
Timbavati myself now.

58:37.866 --> 58:39.367
How on earth would
you ever do that?

58:41.135 --> 58:42.401
Exactly.

58:42.403 --> 58:44.173
That's why I need your help.

58:46.173 --> 58:48.974
Okay.

58:48.976 --> 58:51.877
It's two days' drive,
one on the road and one off.

58:51.879 --> 58:53.444
That's if you have a car,
which you don't.

58:53.446 --> 58:55.513
I can't take dad's car.
He'd hear me taking off.

58:55.515 --> 58:57.982
Then you'd have to
cut through there,

58:57.984 --> 59:00.317
maybe five to six days' walk.

59:00.319 --> 59:02.385
So you think I can make it?

59:02.387 --> 59:05.856
What I think is you're
batshit crazy, Mia.

59:05.858 --> 59:08.361
But if anyone can make it,
surely, you can.

59:11.798 --> 59:13.263
What about food?

59:13.265 --> 59:15.197
I've got some...

59:15.199 --> 59:18.902
bread and cheese
and some ham for Charlie.

59:18.904 --> 59:20.239
Good.

59:28.044 --> 59:30.211
You should take this too.

59:30.213 --> 59:31.946
No, Mick, I can't.

59:31.948 --> 59:34.015
You've been saving
that for years.

59:34.017 --> 59:36.318
Mia, take it.

59:36.320 --> 59:38.855
You need it more than I do.

59:56.305 --> 59:58.441
Are you looking for
the enclosure keys?

01:00:00.441 --> 01:00:02.476
Never give up on your dream.

01:00:03.277 --> 01:00:04.880
Go save him.

01:00:07.981 --> 01:00:10.416
I love you, my little ferret.

01:00:10.418 --> 01:00:12.354
Thank you, Jodie.

01:00:20.359 --> 01:00:22.062
Come on! Come on!

01:00:31.036 --> 01:00:32.269
Come on, come on.

01:00:32.271 --> 01:00:34.070
Let's go.

01:00:34.072 --> 01:00:35.841
Come, come, come.

01:00:40.078 --> 01:00:41.176
Let's go, boy.

01:00:41.178 --> 01:00:43.014
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:00:43.647 --> 01:00:45.082
Let's go.

01:00:57.059 --> 01:00:58.894
We can do this, okay?

01:00:58.896 --> 01:01:00.327
Good.

01:01:00.329 --> 01:01:01.598
Let's go.

01:01:03.399 --> 01:01:05.034
Hold up.

01:01:10.071 --> 01:01:11.304
John.

01:01:55.279 --> 01:01:57.012
I don't believe it.

01:02:02.486 --> 01:02:04.520
- <i>Hey, John.</i>
- Yeah, we need help, Kevin.

01:02:04.522 --> 01:02:06.055
- <i>What?</i>
- <i>It's Mia.</i>

01:02:06.057 --> 01:02:07.388
She's run away with
that bloody lion of hers

01:02:07.390 --> 01:02:08.656
and we can't get out
of the house.

01:02:08.658 --> 01:02:10.192
Okay.

01:02:10.194 --> 01:02:11.560
'Cause the big
cats are all over the place.

01:02:11.562 --> 01:02:12.727
Just get here soon.

01:02:12.729 --> 01:02:14.095
Yeah, bring lots of people.

01:02:14.097 --> 01:02:15.262
<i>And Mia?</i>

01:02:15.264 --> 01:02:17.432
No, no, I'll take care of that.

01:02:17.434 --> 01:02:18.700
I don't get it.

01:02:18.702 --> 01:02:20.968
This is all because
of that bloody Charlie.

01:02:20.970 --> 01:02:24.173
The waterhole, it's the first
place I'd go if I was her.

01:02:29.044 --> 01:02:31.281
I'll find her.
Don't worry.

01:02:39.653 --> 01:02:42.157
We've just got us a car,
Charlie.

01:02:48.729 --> 01:02:50.263
Stay inside.

01:03:14.418 --> 01:03:16.184
Come on, guys.

01:03:16.186 --> 01:03:17.455
All of you.

01:03:45.114 --> 01:03:47.184
Now, Dad.

01:03:52.354 --> 01:03:54.056
Come, come.

01:04:01.062 --> 01:04:02.529
Mia!

01:04:04.130 --> 01:04:05.532
Mia!

01:04:35.793 --> 01:04:37.427
Mia, what are you doing?

01:04:37.429 --> 01:04:39.795
Never go near
Charlie ever again.

01:04:39.797 --> 01:04:42.598
What are you talking about?
Put that gun down!

01:04:42.600 --> 01:04:44.533
- Move away from the Jeep.
- Mia.

01:04:44.535 --> 01:04:46.538
I'm not telling you again.
Move.

01:04:52.242 --> 01:04:54.108
This is crazy.

01:04:54.110 --> 01:04:55.510
What are you doing?

01:04:55.512 --> 01:04:58.412
I was there, Dad,
yesterday, in that field.

01:04:58.414 --> 01:04:59.646
How could you do it?

01:04:59.648 --> 01:05:01.515
You slaughter lions for money

01:05:01.517 --> 01:05:03.282
and then lie to
everyone about it.

01:05:03.284 --> 01:05:06.822
Everything about you, everything
about this farm is a lie.

01:05:08.123 --> 01:05:09.591
Mia, please.

01:05:11.493 --> 01:05:12.558
You don't understand.

01:05:12.560 --> 01:05:14.593
I understand everything.

01:05:14.595 --> 01:05:16.863
No, I sell to people
with permits. That's it.

01:05:16.865 --> 01:05:18.830
I can't control what
they do with the lions.

01:05:18.832 --> 01:05:21.434
But you know what they do,
and you make money from it.

01:05:21.436 --> 01:05:22.734
No, I don't.

01:05:22.736 --> 01:05:25.171
They make money from it,
not me, not our farm,

01:05:25.173 --> 01:05:26.538
not since your grandfather died.

01:05:26.540 --> 01:05:28.539
But our lions
are being killed!

01:05:28.541 --> 01:05:30.208
Do you think I like that?

01:05:30.210 --> 01:05:32.309
That is the way
South Africa works.

01:05:32.311 --> 01:05:34.880
It's the way,

01:05:34.882 --> 01:05:37.615
it's the way it's always worked.

01:05:37.617 --> 01:05:39.482
You can't change the world.

01:05:39.484 --> 01:05:40.753
You can.

01:05:45.892 --> 01:05:48.459
That's enough. I don't even know
why I'm arguing with you.

01:05:48.461 --> 01:05:49.825
Give me that gun back right now.

01:05:49.827 --> 01:05:51.262
Ah!

01:06:06.843 --> 01:06:08.312
Sorry, Dad.

01:06:13.550 --> 01:06:15.853
Come, boy.
Come, boy, let's go.

01:06:17.286 --> 01:06:18.654
Good boy.

01:06:29.964 --> 01:06:32.232
Mick, listen.

01:06:32.234 --> 01:06:34.533
It's me.
Come quick and get dad.

01:06:34.535 --> 01:06:36.736
He's at the Mafui waterhole.

01:06:36.738 --> 01:06:37.905
Okay, bye.

01:06:40.974 --> 01:06:42.543
It's okay.

01:06:43.410 --> 01:06:45.213
We can do this.

01:06:47.447 --> 01:06:49.416
I know we can.

01:06:56.755 --> 01:06:57.958
Shit.

01:07:05.296 --> 01:07:07.731
I'm fine, I'm fine.

01:07:07.733 --> 01:07:08.935
I'm fine.

01:07:24.648 --> 01:07:26.216
Stay down, boy.

01:07:29.318 --> 01:07:30.517
Hello, miss.

01:07:30.519 --> 01:07:31.886
- Hello.
- Full?

01:07:31.888 --> 01:07:33.624
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

01:07:34.490 --> 01:07:36.691
Good car.

01:07:36.693 --> 01:07:38.695
I'm... I'm gonna go and pay.

01:07:53.741 --> 01:07:55.440
<i>With regards to the new</i>

01:07:55.442 --> 01:07:57.310
<i>presidential voting election.</i>

01:07:57.312 --> 01:08:00.312
<i>We do know that the NEC as
well as the PEC elections</i>

01:08:00.314 --> 01:08:03.048
<i>are going to be taking place
over the next couple of days.</i>

01:08:03.050 --> 01:08:04.682
<i>Is it going to be
a united party?</i>

01:08:04.684 --> 01:08:06.284
That will be $5.44.

01:08:06.286 --> 01:08:07.785
<i>Is it going
to be a divided party?</i>

01:08:07.787 --> 01:08:09.421
<i>One is just going to
have to wait and see.</i>

01:08:09.423 --> 01:08:10.856
<i>Meanwhile,
the search is still on</i>

01:08:10.858 --> 01:08:12.991
<i>for missing 14-year-old

01:08:12.993 --> 01:08:15.359

three-year-old white lion</i>

01:08:15.361 --> 01:08:17.594
<i>in the Dinokeng Reserve area.</i>

01:08:17.595 --> 01:08:20.462
<i>Authorities have cautioned

01:08:20.465 --> 01:08:22.835
<i>to please come forward
with any information...</i>

01:08:29.508 --> 01:08:31.506
Mick, is Dad okay?

01:08:31.509 --> 01:08:33.341
Yes, they're
bringing him home now.

01:08:33.344 --> 01:08:34.343
Where are you?

01:08:34.345 --> 01:08:35.645
I don't know.

01:08:35.647 --> 01:08:37.680
The M-31 I think?

01:08:37.682 --> 01:08:39.881
Where though, what exit?

01:08:39.883 --> 01:08:41.015
Nineteen, why?

01:08:41.017 --> 01:08:42.818
I just saw on TV

01:08:42.819 --> 01:08:44.618
they're setting up road
blocks in Newlands.

01:08:44.621 --> 01:08:46.689
You have to get off
the freeway now.

01:08:46.691 --> 01:08:47.959
I can't move!

01:09:34.367 --> 01:09:35.569
Ugh!

01:09:39.738 --> 01:09:40.970
Just stop it!

01:09:40.971 --> 01:09:43.841
Just stop looking
at me like that!

01:09:47.011 --> 01:09:49.578
How can you be so stupid?

01:09:49.581 --> 01:09:50.846
I'm just a kid.

01:09:50.849 --> 01:09:52.581
How could I ever save you?

01:09:52.582 --> 01:09:53.750
It's impossible!

01:09:53.752 --> 01:09:55.454
We're never gonna make it.

01:09:57.488 --> 01:09:59.388
Why don't you just kill me, huh?

01:09:59.390 --> 01:10:01.923
Why don't you just
finish me off?

01:10:01.925 --> 01:10:05.596
Just kill me!
Just kill me, you stupid lion!

01:10:37.891 --> 01:10:41.662
If we can see a shooting star,
it means we can do it, right?

01:10:44.565 --> 01:10:47.499
Just one shooting star,

01:10:47.501 --> 01:10:48.936
just one.

01:11:22.532 --> 01:11:24.099
Yeah.

01:11:24.101 --> 01:11:25.966
<i>John-o, Jesus, man.
Where have you been?</i>

01:11:25.968 --> 01:11:29.636
<i>I need my confirmation for
tomorrow, please, please.</i>

01:11:29.638 --> 01:11:32.172
There isn't gonna be one.

01:11:32.174 --> 01:11:34.175
The lion's not for sale anymore.

01:11:34.177 --> 01:11:35.910
<i>What do you mean the
lion's not for sale anymore?</i>

01:11:35.912 --> 01:11:37.144
<i>You made a promise.
I made a promise.</i>

01:11:37.146 --> 01:11:38.411
<i>Come on, John, man.</i>

01:11:38.413 --> 01:11:39.946
<i>My biggest client is flying
in tomorrow for this.</i>

01:11:39.948 --> 01:11:41.581
<i>Don't do this to your family.</i>

01:11:41.583 --> 01:11:43.019
<i>You know what I mean.</i>

01:12:13.879 --> 01:12:15.147
Let's go.

01:12:18.150 --> 01:12:20.583
I need to understand
what's happening to us.

01:12:20.585 --> 01:12:22.118
Do you think I don't?

01:12:22.120 --> 01:12:24.524
- John!
- Not now.

01:12:25.757 --> 01:12:27.089
She's a child.

01:12:27.091 --> 01:12:29.694
Alice, everything she sees
is in black and white.

01:12:31.695 --> 01:12:32.898
Sorry, John.

01:12:33.965 --> 01:12:35.668
It's Dirk.

01:12:46.109 --> 01:12:48.610
What's going on, Johnny boy?

01:12:48.612 --> 01:12:49.910
I'm hearing stories

01:12:49.912 --> 01:12:52.245
that your daughter has
taken off with my lion.

01:12:52.247 --> 01:12:53.881
It's not your lion.

01:12:53.883 --> 01:12:55.115
I told you, the deal's off,

01:12:55.117 --> 01:12:56.784
so this is none
of your business.

01:12:56.786 --> 01:12:58.653
Well, you know, until
you pay me back my deposit

01:12:58.655 --> 01:13:00.721
and you pay that loan off,
this is very much my business!

01:13:00.723 --> 01:13:02.724
Get the hell off my farm.

01:13:08.196 --> 01:13:09.899
Your farm?

01:13:12.601 --> 01:13:14.233
Okay.

01:13:14.235 --> 01:13:17.670
But just know that I'm gonna
be doing things my way.

01:13:17.672 --> 01:13:19.103
Stay away from them.

01:13:19.105 --> 01:13:21.607
Bah! Bah!

01:13:21.609 --> 01:13:22.907
Stay away from my daughter!

01:13:22.909 --> 01:13:24.009
Hey, hey, hey!

01:13:24.011 --> 01:13:26.143
Whoa!

01:13:26.145 --> 01:13:28.849
<i>Bonjour, bonjour.</i>

01:13:48.901 --> 01:13:51.734
Alice, I'm gonna find Mia.

01:13:51.736 --> 01:13:52.767
Kevin.

01:13:52.769 --> 01:13:53.903
Mick.

01:13:53.905 --> 01:13:55.139
Mick!

01:13:56.874 --> 01:13:58.908
My daughter is alone
out there with a lion

01:13:58.910 --> 01:14:01.041
and you think what, I'm
gonna stay here and wait?

01:14:01.043 --> 01:14:02.844
My love, if I find
anything, I'll call you.

01:14:02.846 --> 01:14:04.011
The police will too.

01:14:04.013 --> 01:14:06.247
We're going with you,

01:14:06.249 --> 01:14:07.985
and that's it.

01:14:38.012 --> 01:14:40.212
<i>Alpha team, we are positive.</i>

01:14:40.214 --> 01:14:43.117
<i>You are free to
shoot anytime, over.</i>

01:14:44.817 --> 01:14:47.054
They have a shoot
to kill authorization.

01:14:48.321 --> 01:14:50.287
What does that mean?

01:14:50.289 --> 01:14:52.893
It means anyone
can kill Charlie now.

01:14:58.964 --> 01:15:00.665
We can't be far now.

01:15:00.667 --> 01:15:02.868
We should be hitting the
bush around the next bend.

01:15:11.043 --> 01:15:12.612
What?

01:15:24.721 --> 01:15:25.923
What?

01:15:28.692 --> 01:15:30.260
1997.

01:15:41.836 --> 01:15:43.205
No, no, no, no.

01:15:49.276 --> 01:15:51.210
- Are you okay?
- No, no, no.

01:15:51.212 --> 01:15:53.949
I'm fine, thanks.
Just waiting for my dad.

01:15:54.414 --> 01:15:56.415
Stop it.

01:15:56.417 --> 01:15:58.416
- Do you need help?
- Fine, thanks.

01:15:58.418 --> 01:16:01.186
My parents should
be here in a minute.

01:16:03.756 --> 01:16:05.790
<i>You have one new message.</i>

01:16:05.792 --> 01:16:07.224
<i>Mia, everyone is authorized</i>

01:16:07.226 --> 01:16:08.358
<i>to try and shoot Charlie now.</i>

01:16:08.360 --> 01:16:10.428
<i>I just heard it on the radio.</i>

01:16:10.430 --> 01:16:12.229
Set another
barricade down the road.

01:16:12.231 --> 01:16:13.496
Put security in there.

01:16:13.498 --> 01:16:15.231
Stop it.
People are going to see you.

01:16:15.233 --> 01:16:17.834
All right,
is everybody out?

01:16:17.836 --> 01:16:20.204
I must be out of my mind,
but we have no choice.

01:16:20.206 --> 01:16:22.676
It's the only way to
get through to the bush.

01:16:27.411 --> 01:16:28.914
Come.

01:16:59.208 --> 01:17:01.540
Mommy, mommy,
look, there's a lion.

01:17:01.542 --> 01:17:03.776
Oh, stop it.
You always say crazy things.

01:17:03.778 --> 01:17:05.080
Come choose, come choose.

01:17:07.282 --> 01:17:09.048
There's a lion
in the building!

01:17:34.040 --> 01:17:35.172
You think they're
still together?

01:17:35.174 --> 01:17:36.340
Well, I hope to
God they're not

01:17:36.342 --> 01:17:37.506
because it's only
a matter of time

01:17:37.508 --> 01:17:39.278
before that starved
lion turns on her.

01:17:40.412 --> 01:17:41.577
I just got a
hold of my brother.

01:17:41.579 --> 01:17:43.212
His unit's in the Zambezi.

01:17:43.214 --> 01:17:44.915
He said they've just been
spotted at the China Mall.

01:17:44.917 --> 01:17:46.215
- Let's go.
- Move, move, move!

01:17:46.217 --> 01:17:47.787
Go, go, go!

01:18:03.899 --> 01:18:05.333
Good boy.

01:18:12.408 --> 01:18:13.940
Oh, yes, we made it!

01:18:13.942 --> 01:18:16.342
We actually made it.

01:19:28.677 --> 01:19:30.012
My lion.

01:19:30.914 --> 01:19:32.412
Your lion.

01:19:32.414 --> 01:19:33.950
Your lion.

01:20:08.013 --> 01:20:10.416
Charlie! Charlie!

01:20:20.993 --> 01:20:22.227
Charlie!

01:20:35.038 --> 01:20:36.304
We'll find her.

01:20:36.306 --> 01:20:37.973
I promise you.

01:20:37.975 --> 01:20:39.977
There's something
you're not telling me.

01:20:41.177 --> 01:20:42.613
I know it.

01:20:45.582 --> 01:20:49.586
Right now, we really need
to get some sleep, hmm.

01:21:21.481 --> 01:21:23.450
Where were you, boy?

01:21:26.051 --> 01:21:27.320
Let's go.

01:21:36.694 --> 01:21:38.163
Come, boy.

01:21:39.197 --> 01:21:42.164
Charlie, wait for me, boy.

01:21:46.505 --> 01:21:49.708
Go, Charlie! Go, Charlie,
they'll kill you! Go!

01:21:59.383 --> 01:22:01.051
Where is he, huh?

01:22:02.485 --> 01:22:04.117
Come here.

01:22:04.119 --> 01:22:06.356
Where's my lion?
Where is my white lion?

01:22:08.091 --> 01:22:09.360
Ah!

01:22:16.097 --> 01:22:17.697
Shoot him!

01:22:17.699 --> 01:22:19.598
Shoot the lion!

01:22:19.600 --> 01:22:21.233
Shoot him!

01:22:21.235 --> 01:22:23.405
- Shoot the lion!
- Come on, guys. Let's go.

01:22:29.077 --> 01:22:30.746
Shit,
there's no bullet.

01:22:38.151 --> 01:22:39.787
Charlie, that's enough.

01:22:41.088 --> 01:22:42.423
Charlie, come, let's go!

01:22:44.857 --> 01:22:46.359
Let's go, boy.

01:23:01.372 --> 01:23:02.574
Stay with Mick.

01:23:06.144 --> 01:23:07.443
I told you to stay away!

01:23:07.445 --> 01:23:09.511
Your white lion
attacked me, John!

01:23:09.513 --> 01:23:11.113
I don't give
a damn about the lion.

01:23:11.115 --> 01:23:12.647
What about my daughter?

01:23:12.649 --> 01:23:14.749
- I don't know.
- If you put her in any danger,

01:23:14.751 --> 01:23:16.884
I swear to God,
I'll kill you both myself.

01:23:16.886 --> 01:23:18.456
Get outta here!

01:23:20.657 --> 01:23:22.491
I don't wanna see you again.

01:23:22.493 --> 01:23:25.226
You can try and seize my farm,
I don't care.

01:23:25.228 --> 01:23:26.462
It doesn't matter.

01:23:29.499 --> 01:23:31.100
Mia, where are you?

01:23:31.867 --> 01:23:33.269
Mia!

01:23:34.303 --> 01:23:35.671
Mia!

01:23:41.409 --> 01:23:44.179
What the hell just happened?

01:23:46.848 --> 01:23:48.583
John!

01:23:50.683 --> 01:23:52.917
Tell her, John.
For Christ's sake!

01:23:52.919 --> 01:23:54.620
This is none of your business.

01:23:54.622 --> 01:23:56.721
You've done everything to
stay clean, I know you have.

01:23:56.723 --> 01:23:58.523
You're not responsible for this.

01:23:58.525 --> 01:23:59.757
Dirk is. South Africa is.

01:23:59.759 --> 01:24:00.892
Come on, man, tell her!

01:24:00.894 --> 01:24:02.361
Tell me what?

01:24:03.563 --> 01:24:05.463
Tell me what!

01:24:05.465 --> 01:24:07.531
Mia saw a canned hunt.

01:24:07.533 --> 01:24:09.332
Oh, no.

01:24:09.334 --> 01:24:11.736
I didn't know that's what
the buyer wanted the lion for,

01:24:11.738 --> 01:24:13.169
- I swear to you.
- Didn't know?

01:24:13.171 --> 01:24:14.638
He had a permit.
I didn't ask...

01:24:14.640 --> 01:24:16.306
You swore to me!

01:24:16.308 --> 01:24:17.840
And I've done everything
I can to make the farm work

01:24:17.842 --> 01:24:20.442
the way we talked about,
the way I promised you.

01:24:20.444 --> 01:24:25.247
How, after what
it cost us before?

01:24:25.249 --> 01:24:26.315
Alice, please.

01:24:26.317 --> 01:24:27.882
And now it cost us Mia!

01:24:27.884 --> 01:24:30.653
Mom, Dad, it's okay!

01:24:30.655 --> 01:24:31.721
Charlie will protect Mia

01:24:31.723 --> 01:24:34.526
until she gets him to the
Timbavati Rivers Reserve.

01:24:38.962 --> 01:24:40.328
Timbavati?

01:24:40.330 --> 01:24:42.197
Yes, Timbavati.

01:24:42.199 --> 01:24:43.631
That's what all this is about.

01:24:43.633 --> 01:24:46.670
Mia's taking Charlie back
to the Shangaan people.

01:25:25.705 --> 01:25:28.375
What do I do?

01:25:41.319 --> 01:25:43.452
She's making for the
Timbavati River Reserve,

01:25:43.454 --> 01:25:45.520
which must put us somewhere
between Kudu and Mount Sheba.

01:25:45.522 --> 01:25:47.422
- You got that?
- Yes.

01:25:47.424 --> 01:25:48.991
We're now going to Timbavati.

01:25:48.993 --> 01:25:50.491
Mick.

01:25:50.493 --> 01:25:51.927
We are coming with you.

01:25:51.929 --> 01:25:53.364
Alice.

01:25:53.931 --> 01:25:55.466
Don't.

01:26:17.786 --> 01:26:20.552
Charlie, wait!

01:26:20.554 --> 01:26:24.024
We're supposed to
stick together.

01:26:24.026 --> 01:26:26.428
Just give me a chance.

01:26:30.530 --> 01:26:34.600
Just wait.

01:26:34.602 --> 01:26:38.402
I was very much
in love, very naive,

01:26:38.404 --> 01:26:40.541
and very pregnant with Mia.

01:26:42.475 --> 01:26:44.445
And you were...

01:26:45.779 --> 01:26:48.778
a very happy baby.

01:26:48.780 --> 01:26:54.017
We were doing lunch with one
of our clients, and one day,

01:26:54.019 --> 01:26:57.754
your father forgot something
on the kitchen table.

01:26:57.756 --> 01:27:00.492
So we drove after him.

01:27:07.398 --> 01:27:09.301
When we get to the enclosure,

01:27:11.501 --> 01:27:13.870
the hunt had begun.

01:27:19.843 --> 01:27:23.281
And they killed
that beautiful lion...

01:27:24.780 --> 01:27:26.546
for no reason

01:27:26.548 --> 01:27:30.287
with a crossbow,
and you saw everything.

01:27:34.656 --> 01:27:36.557
That was the most
terrible thing, and...

01:27:39.461 --> 01:27:42.664
we went back to
the car both traumatized.

01:27:45.100 --> 01:27:47.666
And your whole tiny body shaking

01:27:47.668 --> 01:27:49.401
and you were freezing cold,

01:27:49.403 --> 01:27:51.503
and I didn't say anything.

01:27:51.505 --> 01:27:53.672
I couldn't say anything.

01:27:53.674 --> 01:27:55.639
I am so sorry.

01:27:55.641 --> 01:27:56.708
I left.

01:27:56.710 --> 01:27:57.808
That's why we left.

01:27:57.810 --> 01:28:01.011
That's why we went to London.

01:28:01.013 --> 01:28:04.684
And your father came back
to us and I forgave him.

01:28:06.052 --> 01:28:07.853
And we had...

01:28:11.156 --> 01:28:13.525
ten happy years.

01:28:52.728 --> 01:28:53.996
Wait.

01:29:03.603 --> 01:29:05.203
It's okay, Mom.

01:29:05.205 --> 01:29:06.806
It's okay.

01:29:06.808 --> 01:29:08.873
It doesn't matter.

01:29:08.875 --> 01:29:10.943
Mia will get Charlie
back to Timbavati

01:29:10.945 --> 01:29:15.212
and everything
will be fine, okay?

01:29:15.214 --> 01:29:16.947
The legend will become true.

01:29:16.949 --> 01:29:18.183
We'll all be saved.

01:29:18.185 --> 01:29:19.887
We'll be okay.

01:29:25.925 --> 01:29:28.895
She's alive.
She's headed to West Timbavati.

01:29:31.697 --> 01:29:32.963
Kevin.

01:29:32.965 --> 01:29:34.798
Move, move, move!

01:29:34.800 --> 01:29:35.832
Let's go.

01:29:55.952 --> 01:29:57.552
We did it.

01:29:57.554 --> 01:29:59.690
We did it, Charlie.

01:30:05.227 --> 01:30:09.262
I have no more strength,
but you have to go.

01:30:09.264 --> 01:30:10.898
You have to cross
that river, Charlie.

01:30:10.900 --> 01:30:13.002
You'll be free.
Your life is there.

01:30:17.271 --> 01:30:18.740
It's a lion!

01:30:31.251 --> 01:30:34.522
It's okay.
It's okay.

01:30:36.523 --> 01:30:39.757
I'm only crying
because I'm happy.

01:31:34.609 --> 01:31:35.808
Charlie, go!

01:31:35.810 --> 01:31:37.142
Get away from here, Charlie!

01:31:52.926 --> 01:31:54.925
Charlie, go!

01:31:54.927 --> 01:31:56.963
To the bridge, Charlie. Go!

01:31:57.931 --> 01:32:00.331
Go, go, the bridge!

01:32:00.333 --> 01:32:03.166
Go, go, go, go, go!

01:32:03.168 --> 01:32:04.904
Wait, stop!

01:32:14.311 --> 01:32:16.312
Don't touch Charlie!

01:32:16.314 --> 01:32:18.584
He won't hurt her.

01:32:19.384 --> 01:32:21.617
Am I clear to shoot?

01:32:21.619 --> 01:32:23.122
At will!

01:32:25.789 --> 01:32:27.125
You were right.

01:32:28.291 --> 01:32:30.792
You can change the world.

01:32:30.794 --> 01:32:32.060
Dad.

01:32:32.062 --> 01:32:34.029
Please, save him!

01:32:34.031 --> 01:32:35.600
Please!

01:32:37.232 --> 01:32:38.999
Please don't shoot!

01:32:39.001 --> 01:32:41.335
Please!

01:32:41.337 --> 01:32:43.237
Please.
Please, save him.

01:32:43.239 --> 01:32:45.206
Please.
Protect him, Dad, please.

01:32:45.208 --> 01:32:48.010
- No, don't shoot!
- What the hell is he doing?

01:32:52.314 --> 01:32:54.917
Please, don't shoot.

01:32:56.183 --> 01:32:58.952
Easy, Charlie.

01:32:58.954 --> 01:33:00.956
You're gonna be fine.

01:33:02.256 --> 01:33:03.792
Please, Mom!

01:33:05.725 --> 01:33:08.362
Please don't shoot!
Please!

01:33:17.703 --> 01:33:19.003
I can't shoot anymore.

01:33:19.005 --> 01:33:21.141
He's entered the
Timbavati River Reserve.

01:33:28.981 --> 01:33:30.212
Mia!

01:33:30.214 --> 01:33:31.750
Mia!

01:33:33.085 --> 01:33:34.621
Mia!

01:34:51.189 --> 01:34:53.055
- I see him.
- You do?

01:34:53.057 --> 01:34:54.292
Ah, you see him?

01:34:55.426 --> 01:34:56.860
He's got a family.

01:34:56.862 --> 01:34:57.861
- Look.
- Oh, there he is.

01:34:57.863 --> 01:34:58.861
Ooh.

01:34:58.863 --> 01:35:00.928
He's huge.

01:35:00.930 --> 01:35:03.201
He's got
a wife and children.

01:35:11.274 --> 01:35:13.776
Hey,
where are you going?

01:35:16.079 --> 01:35:17.781
He's beautiful.

01:35:38.403 --> 01:35:39.932
