WEBVTT

00:03.045 --> 00:05.047
Yeah, tell me your name again. Sorry.

00:05.047 --> 00:06.924
<i>Alice Sinclair.</i>

00:06.924 --> 00:10.302
So, you're saying, Alice,
that this is a definite SOS call...

00:10.302 --> 00:13.013
- <i>No, we're saying--</i>
- ...or that you're still not sure?

00:13.013 --> 00:15.349
Because they both are
two very different things, Alice.

00:15.349 --> 00:17.893
<i>We're saying, if you let me speak,</i>

00:18.852 --> 00:21.980
that due to its changing course
and unusual communications,

00:21.980 --> 00:27.778
that there is a stronger chance than ever
that flight KA29 is in danger.

00:27.778 --> 00:29.196
Unusual communications?

00:29.196 --> 00:32.950
Failure to respond, contradiction
in statements made by the pilot,

00:32.950 --> 00:36.703
and as of whatever it is now, 8:07,
that's all we've got.

00:36.703 --> 00:38.539
<i>But it's enough to have us worried.</i>

00:38.539 --> 00:40.832
Right, so, I'm taking this higher?

00:40.832 --> 00:42.459
<i>Yeah, that would be our suggestion.</i>

00:42.459 --> 00:44.211
Coming to you with any questions.

00:44.211 --> 00:45.838
Also very sensible.

00:45.838 --> 00:47.881
<i>Okay. Thank you, Alice.</i>

00:47.881 --> 00:49.174
You're welcome.

01:20.038 --> 01:21.665
- Where's the duty officer?
- Right through.

01:21.665 --> 01:22.749
Thanks.

01:32.509 --> 01:33.635
Okay, so--

01:39.725 --> 01:41.518
I need our JTAC duty officer.

01:41.518 --> 01:43.270
- Zahra, I'm in a meeting.
- I can see that.

01:43.270 --> 01:44.938
- Morning.
- Morning.

01:50.235 --> 01:53.197
- Have you got any idea what you've just--
- Our JTAC duty officer?

01:54.239 --> 01:55.574
Is on paternity leave.

01:55.574 --> 01:57.242
Right. Then I need whoever's covering...

01:57.242 --> 01:58.493
- Me.
- ...to spea--

01:59.161 --> 02:02.581
to speak to their colleagues at JTAC.
Set up a call or a meeting.

02:02.581 --> 02:05.459
We have a suspected hijack
of a British passenger plane

02:05.459 --> 02:07.794
due to arrive in London in five hours.

02:20.265 --> 02:22.309
Nobody's interested.

02:22.309 --> 02:24.269
- It's important.
- You're always interfering.

02:29.149 --> 02:31.235
Sit. Don't make trouble.

02:31.235 --> 02:33.987
Hey. Is everything all right?

02:34.488 --> 02:35.781
Everything okay.

02:36.865 --> 02:38.617
Is there something you wanna talk about?

02:39.201 --> 02:41.203
No. No talking. Thank you.

02:52.714 --> 02:55.050
- What was that about?
- Obviously, I don't know.

02:56.385 --> 02:58.720
She's telling him to shut up.

02:59.596 --> 03:01.807
What he's saying will get them in trouble.

03:02.808 --> 03:04.059
What is he saying?

03:05.477 --> 03:10.482
He says the guns the hijackers are using
are fake.

04:19.593 --> 04:21.345
<i>Deep breaths in...</i>

04:23.180 --> 04:25.557
<i>then exhaling slowly through the nose.</i>

04:28.060 --> 04:30.062
<i>Eyes opening gently now.</i>

04:32.147 --> 04:36.276
<i>Take a moment to take in the peace
and the calm of the world around you.</i>

04:37.903 --> 04:40.781
<i>If what he's saying is true,
this could all be over.</i>

04:41.698 --> 04:44.952
I mean, just on numbers alone,
there's what? Five of them?

04:45.744 --> 04:48.080
That's ten against one. More probably, 20.

04:48.705 --> 04:50.666
It's not as easy as that, is it?

04:50.666 --> 04:52.709
We could end this. Now.

04:52.709 --> 04:57.214
Why? Because of some
old man's hunch? Is that why?

04:59.216 --> 05:00.551
Ask how he knows.

05:01.260 --> 05:03.303
- She doesn't want to talk.
- Ask her.

05:09.977 --> 05:11.061
Excuse me.

05:12.396 --> 05:15.065
- What your husband said--
- Forget what he said.

05:15.816 --> 05:19.653
But the other passengers are asking
how does he know?

05:19.653 --> 05:21.405
- He knows because--
- Quiet!

05:21.405 --> 05:22.739
Quiet!

05:22.739 --> 05:24.157
...because he was in the Egyptian military

05:24.157 --> 05:25.909
for thirty years.

05:25.909 --> 05:29.705
Because he dealt with hijackings
all the time.

05:30.455 --> 05:34.001
- No! You let me speak!
- What's he shouting about?

05:37.880 --> 05:39.423
You. What's your problem?

05:42.843 --> 05:43.844
Well?

05:48.724 --> 05:49.725
Well?

05:50.309 --> 05:51.935
He wants to get a--

05:52.477 --> 05:54.897
a message to his grandchildren.

05:56.190 --> 05:58.025
Doesn't think he's gonna see 'em again.

05:58.025 --> 06:01.236
And we were just trying to comfort him
and tell him that, you know,

06:02.613 --> 06:04.323
it's the same for all of us.

06:11.496 --> 06:12.497
Keep it down.

06:22.591 --> 06:26.512
Kingdom 2-9 is leaving northern
Iraq and just entering Turkish airspace.

06:27.596 --> 06:31.141
Let's have Istanbul challenge the pilot
one more time on this change of route.

06:32.059 --> 06:34.520
This is our pilot, Robin Allen.

06:34.520 --> 06:36.897
Old-school, Cathay-Pacific type.

06:36.897 --> 06:40.943
He's been with Kingdom
for over a decade. Long haul, mainly.

06:41.652 --> 06:44.029
Too long in the tooth to know
this won't be going unnoticed.

06:44.029 --> 06:44.988
Yeah.

06:44.988 --> 06:47.616
So what the hell are they playing at?

06:50.869 --> 06:54.998
He says in the hijacks
he dealt with by the PLO, or whoever,

06:54.998 --> 06:57.084
they never had live rounds.

06:57.084 --> 06:58.544
Always blanks?

07:04.842 --> 07:06.009
Blanks make a bang.

07:06.009 --> 07:07.427
They keep people in check,

07:07.427 --> 07:10.222
but they do no damage
because there's no actual bullet.

07:10.222 --> 07:13.267
No, what's the word in English?

07:14.393 --> 07:15.435
No projectile.

07:18.730 --> 07:20.774
The shot that was fired in business,

07:20.774 --> 07:23.151
no one was hit,
no hole in the plane, nothing.

07:23.151 --> 07:26.697
Otherwise, we'd know about it, right?
We'd be losing pressure.

07:28.365 --> 07:31.285
We have to get a message back there,
have them look for the bullet.

07:31.285 --> 07:33.579
If they find it, fine, at least we know.
But--

07:33.579 --> 07:35.914
But if they don't,
if there's no actual bullet...

07:35.914 --> 07:38.584
- Listen to yourself.
- Maybe the old guy's right.

07:38.584 --> 07:39.668
Just stop.

07:42.004 --> 07:43.088
Stop.

07:47.759 --> 07:49.887
- Hey, stop.
- Why?

07:49.887 --> 07:52.806
Because there's other stuff going down,
other shit at play.

07:52.806 --> 07:55.517
- Like what?
- Like, we are signaling to the ground.

07:55.517 --> 07:58.520
We're talking to the ground
to let 'em know that we are in trouble.

07:59.104 --> 08:00.314
We? Who's we?

08:00.314 --> 08:01.398
We.

08:07.905 --> 08:11.783
Listen, if the guns are fake,
this could be over in a heartbeat.

08:12.451 --> 08:14.703
It's like you said,
we can just enjoy the movie.

08:14.703 --> 08:16.496
True, but the guns are real.

08:16.496 --> 08:18.916
- How can you say that?
- I'm telling you, they're real.

08:18.916 --> 08:21.668
- How could you possibly say that?
- Listen to me, okay?

08:21.668 --> 08:25.506
If you want to get the better of someone,
you've got to put yourself in their shoes.

08:25.506 --> 08:27.716
You've got to think like they think.

08:29.051 --> 08:31.470
Now, what if I made you hijack
a plane of this size?

08:31.970 --> 08:34.139
Do you imagine how daunting that would be?

08:34.139 --> 08:37.518
Then how do you think you'd feel
if I told you to do it with a toy gun?

08:37.518 --> 08:38.769
What would you say, Hugo?

08:39.977 --> 08:42.063
I'll tell you what you'd say.
You'd say, "No."

08:42.063 --> 08:46.693
You'd say, "I need a gun to protect myself
for when the passengers try it on."

08:46.693 --> 08:50.489
Because you're not stupid.
Right, you would have thought it through.

08:50.489 --> 08:52.491
- So you stay out of it, yes?
- But--

08:52.491 --> 08:55.994
No, you stay out of it
for your own safety.

08:57.287 --> 08:58.288
Got it?

09:09.716 --> 09:12.511
Sod it. You don't get to decide
who does what. No one appointed you.

09:12.511 --> 09:13.679
Don't do that. Don't--

09:21.144 --> 09:23.647
Don't feel good. I feel sick.

09:25.983 --> 09:27.276
He says he's feeling sick.

09:28.610 --> 09:29.778
How sick?

09:30.737 --> 09:33.198
You gonna puke?
Is that what you're saying?

09:33.907 --> 09:34.908
I think so.

09:36.410 --> 09:38.412
Okay. Take him.

09:39.288 --> 09:43.000
But don't flush the toilet.
Keep the door open.

09:44.168 --> 09:45.169
Sorry?

09:45.878 --> 09:50.716
Well, if he's gonna be sick,
I wanna see it.

09:52.134 --> 09:56.263
And if he's bullshitting, well,
he's got himself another problem.

09:57.848 --> 09:59.266
You still feeling sick?

10:21.997 --> 10:23.040
Shut up.

10:39.431 --> 10:41.266
Right, time's up. Get him out.

10:43.519 --> 10:45.771
Up! Get him out!

10:58.700 --> 11:00.577
- Get it.
- Yeah, go on.

11:06.875 --> 11:08.877
Is that it? Pathetic.

11:17.261 --> 11:18.554
Feel better, do ya?

11:19.513 --> 11:20.722
Empty your pockets.

11:23.642 --> 11:25.644
Are you deaf? Go on.

11:27.354 --> 11:28.355
I'm waiting.

11:36.363 --> 11:37.364
Right.

11:38.365 --> 11:41.243
Sit the fuck down
and face the fuck forward.

11:44.121 --> 11:46.707
<i>Kingdom 2-9, this is Istanbul.
Do you read?</i>

11:49.626 --> 11:52.129
<i>Kingdom 2-9, this is Istanbul Control.</i>

11:52.129 --> 11:55.549
<i>We have been trying to contact you
for five minutes. Do you read?</i>

11:55.549 --> 11:59.511
I managed to get a message to business.
Let's see what happens.

11:59.511 --> 12:00.679
You're a fool.

12:00.679 --> 12:01.805
I'm a fool?

12:03.724 --> 12:04.933
You put them in danger.

12:07.060 --> 12:09.688
This from the man
who gave the hijackers their gun back?

12:13.275 --> 12:14.276
You, up.

12:15.861 --> 12:17.070
All right.

12:20.282 --> 12:22.367
<i>Kingdom 2-9, please identify.</i>

12:23.076 --> 12:25.621
This is what I'm saying.
Every time we cross a border...

12:25.621 --> 12:27.956
<i>Kingdom 2-9, this is Istanbul Control.</i>

12:27.956 --> 12:30.125
- ...this is gonna keep happening.
- Get on with it then.

12:35.464 --> 12:36.840
- Ist--
- <i>Please identify.</i>

12:38.550 --> 12:42.221
Istanbul, good morning. This is
Kingdom 2-9, hearing you loud and clear.

12:42.221 --> 12:45.849
<i>Kingdom 2-9,
I'm reading a heading of 323 degrees.</i>

12:46.975 --> 12:50.187
That is correct.
Maintaining an altitude of 34,000--

12:50.187 --> 12:52.814
<i>2-9, you are 12 miles outside your airway.</i>

12:56.568 --> 12:57.945
Outside, yes. That is correct.

12:57.945 --> 13:03.200
We had some crosswinds
to contend with, but we are now--

13:03.200 --> 13:04.952
<i>Please return to airway two.</i>

13:06.078 --> 13:09.039
Doing that as we speak, Istanbul. Apologies.

13:10.249 --> 13:13.710
<i>Thank you, Kingdom 2-9.
We wish you a happy onward journey.</i>

13:13.710 --> 13:14.795
Thank you, Istanbul.

13:36.817 --> 13:38.151
Nasir?

13:38.151 --> 13:40.362
Your uncle's going to need his insulin.

13:41.280 --> 13:42.656
The needles are in the bag.

13:49.413 --> 13:51.415
Best to ask the Muslim boy.

13:56.211 --> 13:57.421
He's no Muslim.

14:06.763 --> 14:09.141
Sorry, man, I just need to grab
something from the locker.

14:09.141 --> 14:11.435
- No.
- I just ne-- It's just a medicine bag.

14:11.435 --> 14:14.354
- My uncle is ill.
- I said no. Stay in your seat.

14:14.354 --> 14:18.692
What are you being so difficult for, man?
The locker's right there. You can see it.

14:18.692 --> 14:20.736
Are you trying to piss me off, or what?

14:20.736 --> 14:23.572
- No.
- I will show you, man.

14:23.572 --> 14:25.407
- It's right--
- Stay in your fucking seat.

14:27.075 --> 14:28.076
What's your problem?

14:28.994 --> 14:30.454
Look at him. He needs his medicine.

14:31.038 --> 14:32.623
You'd better shut up.

14:33.790 --> 14:35.792
Or he gets
a whole different kind of medicine.

14:37.252 --> 14:38.754
Understand?

14:40.380 --> 14:41.673
Trust me.

14:42.716 --> 14:44.593
You've got no idea
who you are dealing with.

14:46.887 --> 14:48.263
Get in here, both of ya.

14:50.307 --> 14:51.683
You listen to me.

14:51.683 --> 14:54.102
No more toilet breaks,
no more fucking about.

14:54.102 --> 14:56.563
They sit still, or we go back to the bag.

14:56.563 --> 14:59.858
Go back to the bag,
make an example of someone. Right?

15:06.448 --> 15:07.533
No, sit down.

15:32.933 --> 15:35.644
- You said that we wouldn't.
- We've got no choice.

15:35.644 --> 15:37.396
No, we went through this.

15:37.396 --> 15:39.773
I asked you straight up,
and you gave me your word.

15:40.941 --> 15:43.569
We have to, mate,
or we're gonna lose this.

16:12.514 --> 16:13.891
What are you doing?

16:16.143 --> 16:19.563
I said, what are you doing?

16:22.149 --> 16:24.860
My glasses. I dropped my glasses.

16:24.860 --> 16:26.361
Your glasses?

16:29.656 --> 16:30.824
Back in your seat. Go on.

16:31.491 --> 16:36.914
I swear to God,
somebody is gonna get shot, all right?

16:37.956 --> 16:41.543
You keep all this up,
and someone's gonna get a bullet.

16:42.836 --> 16:44.087
There is no bullet.

16:47.674 --> 16:50.636
She said, "Then somebody gets a bullet."
But there's no bullet to get.

16:51.553 --> 16:52.679
I told them,

16:53.180 --> 16:56.767
if they can't find anything,
if they're sure there's nothing,

16:56.767 --> 16:58.143
turn on their reading light.

17:08.987 --> 17:10.113
It's not enough.

17:10.906 --> 17:12.406
Reading light means no bullet.

17:12.406 --> 17:14.451
No bullet means blanks.
That's what he said.

17:14.451 --> 17:17.287
Or it means they couldn't find a bullet.

17:18.789 --> 17:20.915
- There's something in this.
- We don't know that.

17:20.915 --> 17:22.084
We could end this.

17:24.211 --> 17:26.003
Or we could get a lot of people killed.

18:25.772 --> 18:26.773
Marsha!

18:29.693 --> 18:32.487
Sorry, Elliot.
There's a lot going on this morning.

18:32.487 --> 18:36.408
It's okay.
Just treat it like any other lecture.

18:37.034 --> 18:39.328
Except it's not, is it?
It's a job interview.

18:40.120 --> 18:44.875
You've taught it before,
so it's nothing you can't do today. Okay?

18:44.875 --> 18:46.126
Yeah, thank you.

19:05.020 --> 19:07.272
<i>Okay. So this is what we got so far.</i>

19:07.272 --> 19:10.400
Thirty-five minutes after departure,

19:10.400 --> 19:13.362
the pilot makes a distress call
to air traffic control

19:13.362 --> 19:16.114
citing a definite security incident.

19:16.114 --> 19:17.658
Then, seven minutes later,

19:17.658 --> 19:21.370
the pilot calls back saying
that the issue's been resolved.

19:21.370 --> 19:23.455
- Resolved?
- False alarm.

19:23.455 --> 19:26.124
Denied that there was ever a problem,
his mistake.

19:26.124 --> 19:27.876
Three minutes after that,

19:27.876 --> 19:34.508
a passenger sends a text reestablishing
the idea that there's an incident.

19:34.508 --> 19:40.514
Then, as the plane enters Iraqi airspace,
it mysteriously starts diverging--

19:40.514 --> 19:42.182
Sorry. Where are you getting all this?

19:42.182 --> 19:44.017
And the Internet's down.

19:44.017 --> 19:46.937
This is all coming
from air traffic controllers in the Gulf.

19:46.937 --> 19:50.148
- And who's talking to them?
- Flight path control in Swanick.

19:50.649 --> 19:54.778
In fact, Alice, you there?

20:00.075 --> 20:02.119
I think Alice is on mute.

20:04.788 --> 20:05.789
<i>Sorry.</i>

20:05.789 --> 20:09.209
<i>I was just saying
that there are precedents for this.</i>

20:10.127 --> 20:12.462
<i>Pilots would say one thing but do another.</i>

20:12.462 --> 20:16.175
<i>Zigzag so the ground realizes
there's a problem.</i>

20:16.175 --> 20:18.594
<i>If I could just share my screen with you.</i>

20:20.679 --> 20:23.974
<i>So they were three degrees out
due to weather conditions.</i>

20:23.974 --> 20:25.893
<i>You can just see
where I'm moving the cursor.</i>

20:26.393 --> 20:28.812
<i>But ATC in Turkey have just told us</i>

20:28.812 --> 20:32.357
<i>that the pilot has put the plane
back on its intended route.</i>

20:32.357 --> 20:34.860
<i>So if you can see where my cursor is now...</i>

20:35.444 --> 20:37.362
So it's back on course?

20:37.362 --> 20:41.658
<i>Yes, but look. Look at
the angle of their return. It's too acute.</i>

20:41.658 --> 20:43.660
<i>If they continue on that heading...</i>

20:43.660 --> 20:45.996
It's gonna do what you suggested earlier.

20:45.996 --> 20:47.497
It's going to zigzag.

20:49.791 --> 20:51.251
<i>Here we go. Right now, look.</i>

20:54.171 --> 20:56.423
<i>That's a definite overcorrection.</i>

21:01.470 --> 21:04.723
Gina, where's the foreign secretary
this morning?

21:25.911 --> 21:27.120
What's this?

21:31.750 --> 21:33.961
What's so fascinating about this
the whole time?

21:34.962 --> 21:35.963
Who you writing to?

21:37.339 --> 21:38.632
What? No one.

21:40.843 --> 21:43.053
- Is this online?
- No.

21:46.390 --> 21:47.599
Who? Answer me.

21:56.233 --> 21:59.611
- Hey! That is the pilot.
- Jesus!

21:59.611 --> 22:01.071
- The pilot!
- Shit.

22:01.071 --> 22:02.781
How stupid are you lot?

22:04.032 --> 22:06.535
- What did you say to me?
- I'm just saying--

22:06.535 --> 22:07.828
I meant you've got to think--

22:07.828 --> 22:09.204
No. Stop.

22:09.788 --> 22:12.291
- Let him go!
- All right. I am.

22:13.625 --> 22:15.711
- Now.
- I am letting him go.

22:18.172 --> 22:19.173
Now!

22:21.675 --> 22:22.759
All right.

22:24.052 --> 22:25.053
Right, down.

22:25.554 --> 22:27.139
Eyes down, stay down.

22:27.139 --> 22:29.016
I've had enough of your shit.

22:29.016 --> 22:31.435
Put your hands in your lap
where I can see 'em, and don't move.

22:33.520 --> 22:38.025
Now, I'm gonna crack you on the top
of the head with the butt of my gun.

22:39.026 --> 22:41.778
If you try and block me or stop me,
move out of the way,

22:41.778 --> 22:44.114
she's gonna pull that trigger.
Do you understand me?

22:45.991 --> 22:48.660
- Do you understand me?
- Yes.

22:48.660 --> 22:49.745
Good.

22:51.747 --> 22:52.748
You stay still.

22:58.462 --> 23:01.507
Stay still, and you smile.

23:05.677 --> 23:07.262
Smile like you want me to hit you.

23:08.972 --> 23:10.140
Smile like you're happy.

23:15.938 --> 23:17.814
That ain't a proper smile, mate.

23:19.274 --> 23:22.194
And we all wanna see a nice smile!

23:23.362 --> 23:24.363
Don't we?

23:32.287 --> 23:33.330
Smile!

23:39.336 --> 23:42.840
That's it. Say "cheese."

23:45.133 --> 23:47.469
Say it. Go on.

23:49.263 --> 23:52.432
Say "cheese," and all this stops.

23:55.686 --> 23:59.147
Say it, Sam Nelson.

24:00.774 --> 24:01.775
Cheese.

24:02.776 --> 24:03.777
That's it.

24:21.795 --> 24:23.046
Turn off all the screens.

24:26.466 --> 24:28.218
All the screens
for the rest of the flight.

24:41.732 --> 24:42.733
You see, I told you.

24:43.442 --> 24:45.194
If that was me, I would have shot you.

24:45.194 --> 24:47.321
Made an example out of you,
but he can't, can he?

24:47.321 --> 24:49.740
- Hugo...
- This is what I have been talking about.

24:51.533 --> 24:53.994
Shut the fuck up.

25:07.174 --> 25:11.970
It's my pleasure to introduce
the highly esteemed professor of physics,

25:11.970 --> 25:14.181
Marsha Smith-Nelson.

25:20.979 --> 25:22.814
Thank you. Good morning.

25:24.399 --> 25:28.779
About a month ago,
my partner and I went on a city break.

25:30.697 --> 25:33.742
<i>Now, my son,
who is a year or two younger than you,</i>

25:33.742 --> 25:36.495
<i>asked if he could have a party
while we were gone.</i>

25:37.871 --> 25:41.166
So, I took a deep breath,

25:42.084 --> 25:45.963
I thought about it, and I said yes.

25:46.964 --> 25:48.632
<i>After we came back from the weekend,</i>

25:48.632 --> 25:50.801
<i>my partner stopped the car
at the end of the road and said,</i>

25:50.801 --> 25:54.721
<i>"Maybe we go no further.
Right now, the flat's fine.</i>

25:55.639 --> 25:59.309
Nothing's broken. Nothing's stolen.

26:00.519 --> 26:04.147
If we don't go back,
we don't see the damage.

26:04.731 --> 26:06.525
<i>It's as if it doesn't exist."</i>

26:07.317 --> 26:10.279
<i>To which I said,
"Well, what if there is no damage?</i>

26:11.154 --> 26:13.824
<i>If we don't go back,
we don't get to see that either."</i>

26:14.992 --> 26:18.704
As physicists,
what does that remind us of?

26:21.039 --> 26:21.874
Yes?

26:22.541 --> 26:24.543
- Schrödinger's cat?
- Yes, good.

26:24.543 --> 26:30.465
Schrödinger's cat,
where more than one thing could be true.

26:32.676 --> 26:33.927
<i>Maybe everything's fine.</i>

26:37.389 --> 26:38.557
<i>Maybe not.</i>

26:40.934 --> 26:45.230
<i>Maybe it really is as bad
as we've been fearing.</i>

26:48.233 --> 26:54.239
<i>That is the paradox.
That is the problem we find ourselves in.</i>

26:56.408 --> 26:58.327
<i>Until we take action,</i>

26:59.119 --> 27:03.457
<i>until we investigate,
there remains a duality.</i>

27:06.293 --> 27:11.256
<i>It is only our act of looking
that forces nature's hand.</i>

27:23.936 --> 27:24.937
Hey.

27:26.730 --> 27:29.483
Ask if he can prove it.

27:30.943 --> 27:32.986
The blanks.
Ask if he can prove they're blanks.

27:32.986 --> 27:34.154
Or is he just guessing?

27:37.157 --> 27:37.991
Yussuf.

27:37.991 --> 27:41.119
Can you prove they are blanks?

27:41.119 --> 27:46.750
I believe they are blanks,
but without examining the guns myself,

27:47.543 --> 27:48.836
how can I be certain?

27:49.920 --> 27:53.632
He says he can't be certain.
Not without examining the guns himself.

28:17.781 --> 28:20.158
Hey, are you the guy
who's looking for the bullet?

28:20.659 --> 28:22.828
We had one. We found one.

28:22.828 --> 28:25.122
You did? In business?

28:25.122 --> 28:28.000
No, just after takeoff.

28:28.000 --> 28:30.586
Some of the girls in economy
found it in the toilet.

28:31.336 --> 28:33.463
- One of the hijackers took it back.
- Arthur.

28:35.632 --> 28:37.759
But they had it.
They held it in their hands.

28:38.886 --> 28:40.637
- It was there.
- Arthur.

28:54.151 --> 28:56.945
Ask him if it would help
to see what the bullet looks like.

29:07.873 --> 29:11.877
Hey, listen, I will not
sit here and let my uncle get sick.

29:11.877 --> 29:14.046
- Do you hear me?
- What is your problem?

29:14.630 --> 29:16.632
Look, please just let him
get his medicine.

29:16.632 --> 29:19.468
Stop talking to him like that. All of you.

29:19.468 --> 29:22.471
You're raising your voices.
You're antagonizing him.

29:22.471 --> 29:24.056
His uncle is dying.

29:24.056 --> 29:25.849
I understand that,

29:25.849 --> 29:28.018
but the young man
is anxious enough as it is.

29:28.644 --> 29:30.312
This is frightening for him too.

29:32.356 --> 29:33.899
<i>He's doing two drawings.</i>

29:34.733 --> 29:38.904
Drawing A is of a normal bullet.
Drawing B is the blank.

29:39.738 --> 29:40.739
B for blank.

29:42.449 --> 29:44.826
Whoever saw it just needs to say
which one they saw.

29:48.247 --> 29:49.289
Tell him, "Thanks."

29:51.166 --> 29:53.335
They say thank you.

29:57.923 --> 29:59.508
He says it's in his interest too.

30:04.763 --> 30:09.601
That's it now.
After this, you keep my husband out of it.

30:25.534 --> 30:27.536
Okay. Here's the plan.

30:28.120 --> 30:30.163
Right.
The foreign secretary is on her way.

30:30.163 --> 30:34.126
She's asked that we base ourselves here
rather than waste time decamping to COBRA.

30:34.126 --> 30:37.963
All right. Okay, well, with that in mind,
this is not a spectator sport.

30:37.963 --> 30:40.883
Let's clear this floor of all
nonessential personnel, please.

30:41.383 --> 30:44.928
And let's go with what Detective Gahfoor
has suggested, which is...

30:44.928 --> 30:47.639
To get the flight manifest.
Yeah, I've already put that call in.

30:47.639 --> 30:49.850
Finally, and Lydia, I am looking at you,

30:49.850 --> 30:52.936
please let's find a point person for
foreign contact.

30:53.604 --> 30:55.981
If I was a Romanian or Hungarian,
I'd be wanting to know,

30:55.981 --> 31:01.069
"Why is there a unresponsive passenger
plane heading straight towards me?"

31:01.069 --> 31:02.905
So let's give them someone to talk to.

31:02.905 --> 31:05.032
And what does that person tell them?

31:05.032 --> 31:06.783
Ministers have been briefed,

31:07.367 --> 31:10.245
and we'll approve a course of action
within the next 30 minutes.

31:10.829 --> 31:11.997
Let's be absolutely clear.

31:12.706 --> 31:15.000
This has all the makings of
an international tragedy.

31:16.585 --> 31:17.628
Excuse me, please.

31:18.712 --> 31:20.005
Well, there should...

31:25.802 --> 31:26.970
<i>See what you started?</i>

31:26.970 --> 31:29.765
- You're gonna get the manifest personally?
- <i>Yes</i>.

31:30.599 --> 31:34.061
Okay, well, if you can forward that to me,
please, I'd appreciate it.

31:34.061 --> 31:36.438
- Here you go, Dan.
- <i>Daniel, you know I can't do that.</i>

31:37.022 --> 31:38.982
<i>I can run the passenger names
through the PNC--</i>

31:38.982 --> 31:41.026
- Daniel.
- See who's got a criminal record.

31:41.026 --> 31:43.028
<i>Yeah, we'll be doing that anyway.</i>

31:43.612 --> 31:45.489
<i>So, why are you
telling me all of this then?</i>

31:45.489 --> 31:47.574
<i>One minute, there's a problem,
then there's not. Now you say--</i>

31:47.574 --> 31:48.825
You'd prefer not to be updated?

31:49.409 --> 31:52.454
I'm just asking what you want
me to do with this information.

31:52.454 --> 31:54.706
<i>Look, you have a personal interest, right?</i>

31:54.706 --> 31:56.542
Yes. So let me do something.

31:56.542 --> 31:58.168
<i>Just send me the names, please.</i>

31:58.168 --> 32:00.796
Zahra, we need you.

32:03.090 --> 32:06.718
Zahra, I'm good at what I do, so I'm not
just gonna sit here doing nothing.

32:06.718 --> 32:09.221
Look, Daniel, I'm sorry, okay?
I've gotta go.

32:35.664 --> 32:38.125
<i>Please leave a message after the tone.</i>

32:39.793 --> 32:41.545
Operation has commenced.

32:42.921 --> 32:46.925
The plane is under control. Your move.

32:51.889 --> 32:52.890
No.

32:54.016 --> 32:55.434
Can you just ask him, please?

32:55.434 --> 32:58.270
Look, I said I'll ask,
but I know what it's gonna be.

32:58.770 --> 32:59.980
Just stay there.

33:04.693 --> 33:06.028
Two and a half hours in.

33:07.154 --> 33:11.366
We'd have been sat in our seats until now.
This is when it was meant to have started.

33:12.326 --> 33:13.619
Does that mean you've made the call?

33:15.704 --> 33:18.540
And? Are they happy? What did they say?

33:21.251 --> 33:22.252
That's the thing.

33:24.004 --> 33:25.422
It was just a voice mail.

33:33.305 --> 33:35.766
The cabin crew woman, she wants to talk.

33:46.527 --> 33:51.657
I just wanted to mention, we'd normally be
preparing the meal service right now.

33:51.657 --> 33:53.575
Now, you probably don't want us
doing that today.

33:53.575 --> 33:54.660
- No.
- Right.

33:54.660 --> 33:58.121
And I get that, but I'm telling you,
I've been doing this for 15 years.

33:58.121 --> 34:00.332
The hungrier and thirstier they get,
the harder it gets.

34:01.291 --> 34:03.836
Nobody's eating. Yeah?

34:05.254 --> 34:07.256
All right. Just putting it out there.

34:08.841 --> 34:11.677
Water, one each. That's it.

34:16.723 --> 34:18.976
ATC Bucharest just called.

34:18.976 --> 34:20.060
<i>Again?</i>

34:20.060 --> 34:22.771
No, not in an angry way.
They're like bingo callers, these people.

34:22.771 --> 34:25.524
- <i>They just keep on going.</i>
- Aren't you one of these people?

34:25.524 --> 34:27.317
Yes. Which is how I know.

34:27.900 --> 34:30.529
<i>But if we don't talk to them,
this will escalate very quickly.</i>

34:30.529 --> 34:31.446
Okay.

34:31.947 --> 34:33.031
Heidi.

34:33.031 --> 34:35.033
Full manifest from Kingdom Airlines,

34:35.033 --> 34:38.661
all 216 names run through
the police national computer.

34:38.661 --> 34:39.621
Go on.

34:39.621 --> 34:41.456
<i>Only one with any serious convictions.</i>

34:41.456 --> 34:43.958
Attempted murder,
two counts of armed robbery,

34:43.958 --> 34:45.627
released from prison just three weeks ago.

34:45.627 --> 34:49.464
- <i>Name?</i>
- Collins. Jonty Collins. Seat 37C.

34:50.174 --> 34:52.592
<i>One? That's it?</i>

34:53.177 --> 34:54.969
We put far less faith
in the public than that, don't we?

34:54.969 --> 34:56.221
Are you sure there's no one else?

34:56.804 --> 34:58.265
I mean, there are lesser ones.

34:58.891 --> 35:01.018
One for repeated drink driving offenses.

35:02.728 --> 35:05.898
One for trying to take the blame for her
partner's repeated drink driving offenses.

35:06.857 --> 35:08.775
One for VAT fraud.

35:08.775 --> 35:10.444
<i>Yeah, look, did you check everything?</i>

35:10.444 --> 35:11.361
Yes.

35:11.361 --> 35:14.031
<i>Watch list, databases.
Have you gone through all of that?</i>

35:14.031 --> 35:16.700
- I did what you asked me to do.
- Yeah, okay. Thank you.

36:08.794 --> 36:09.837
Water?

36:17.636 --> 36:19.680
- Water?
- Yes, please.

36:20.305 --> 36:21.390
Water, sir?

36:22.975 --> 36:24.518
Do you want some water?

36:28.689 --> 36:29.690
Water, madam?

36:34.820 --> 36:35.946
Still or sparkling?

36:36.446 --> 36:38.323
Water? And you?

36:38.991 --> 36:41.201
Water, please. I'll take some.

36:43.036 --> 36:44.413
- Water?
- Yes.

36:46.874 --> 36:47.958
Water?

36:55.340 --> 36:57.301
Water? Take it, madam.

36:59.386 --> 37:01.722
- Water?
- Put your table down.

37:01.722 --> 37:02.890
Sorry?

37:05.517 --> 37:06.518
Still or sparkling?

37:07.269 --> 37:09.271
- Water?
- I'm okay.

37:09.855 --> 37:11.857
- Which did you see?
- Water?

37:11.857 --> 37:13.567
If it was A, do nothing.

37:14.276 --> 37:16.153
If it was B, and you're sure it's B...

37:16.653 --> 37:17.779
Believe me, I won't.

37:17.779 --> 37:18.906
...turn on your reading light.

37:20.657 --> 37:21.950
I'm good.

37:22.951 --> 37:24.119
Here. Have some.

37:27.164 --> 37:29.041
- Take one.
- Thank you, pass it down.

37:29.041 --> 37:30.334
Water?

37:34.046 --> 37:35.130
Water, anyone?

37:36.757 --> 37:38.050
Yes, I'll take some.

37:39.468 --> 37:40.594
Water?

37:44.640 --> 37:47.267
- I'm not walking.
- No.

37:50.103 --> 37:51.230
We could Boris bike.

37:54.358 --> 37:57.611
No, quite right. I take that back
immediately. No hijacking's worth that.

37:57.611 --> 37:59.446
They really think that's what's happened?

37:59.947 --> 38:00.948
Increasingly.

38:08.413 --> 38:10.958
- What about police escort?
- How long will that take to come?

38:12.000 --> 38:13.168
Fifteen, 20.

38:13.919 --> 38:15.003
And if we did walk?

38:16.046 --> 38:17.464
Ten, 15?

38:25.097 --> 38:27.850
Okay. Right. Yeah.

38:37.276 --> 38:38.277
Come on.

38:44.950 --> 38:45.951
Arthur?

38:56.420 --> 38:58.547
Water? Water, sir?

39:06.263 --> 39:08.807
I think we can all see
what's going on here, can't we?

39:08.807 --> 39:10.434
No need for a reading light.

39:11.310 --> 39:12.561
Not in the middle of the day.

39:15.063 --> 39:16.315
Shall we switch it off?

39:20.736 --> 39:21.737
Are you sure?

39:23.197 --> 39:24.948
Yeah. We're all sure.

39:26.158 --> 39:27.159
Aren't we, girls?

39:40.380 --> 39:41.507
What was all that?

39:42.716 --> 39:44.510
All that moving about back there.

39:45.594 --> 39:48.472
Sorry, it was just a passenger crying.

39:50.516 --> 39:52.768
Just a girl in 23B.

40:09.201 --> 40:10.619
B for blanks.

40:11.537 --> 40:14.581
Tell him he was right.
This changes everything.

40:19.503 --> 40:20.587
<i>Daniel.</i>

40:20.587 --> 40:23.423
I ran all the 216 names through the PNC.

40:23.423 --> 40:26.343
There's only one that comes up
with any sort of serious criminal record.

40:26.343 --> 40:28.595
Yes. I know. Collins.

40:28.595 --> 40:30.597
Collins. Here's the thing.

40:31.723 --> 40:34.685
Five of the names don't come up at all.

40:35.227 --> 40:37.020
<i>There are five passengers on that plane</i>

40:37.020 --> 40:39.356
<i>that fail to register
on any national database.</i>

40:40.023 --> 40:42.401
The passports are valid somehow.

40:43.360 --> 40:45.153
But the five people I've just sent you...

40:47.197 --> 40:48.657
they do not exist.

40:51.285 --> 40:53.287
- Lydia?
- <i>I have to go.</i>

40:57.666 --> 41:01.587
This is it. These are our hijackers.

41:07.009 --> 41:10.596
If everyone on this plane knew what
we know, we could take these guys down.

41:10.596 --> 41:11.889
We could do it right now.

41:11.889 --> 41:14.057
No, Hugo, we have to be smart.

41:14.057 --> 41:17.436
Can't get into a brawl.
It's just you and me.

41:17.436 --> 41:19.730
We can't afford to put
any of the other passengers at risk.

41:19.730 --> 41:22.024
Wait. What? You and me?

41:22.024 --> 41:24.359
- You were the one pushing for this.
- Yeah, I know but I d--

41:24.359 --> 41:25.819
You want to be a part of
everything that happens...

41:25.819 --> 41:28.488
- I did wanna be a part of--
- ...so this is it. Right now, okay?

41:28.488 --> 41:31.325
We isolate one of them,
the most vulnerable one.

41:32.159 --> 41:35.078
We take him out, check his gun
and move on to the next, yes?

41:35.078 --> 41:38.165
Oh, God. Okay.

41:38.165 --> 41:41.585
The old guy at the back, he's got
the most passengers to look after.

41:41.585 --> 41:44.046
There's no one on the other side.
He's isolated.

41:45.714 --> 41:47.508
If we get to him, we take him out.

42:02.481 --> 42:04.066
I just need to grab his medicine.

42:04.566 --> 42:06.568
- Just let--
- No. Sit down.

42:09.905 --> 42:10.989
Get back in your seat.

42:10.989 --> 42:12.991
- I just need to grab--
- I told you, get in your seat.

42:12.991 --> 42:14.785
- I'll be a second.
- What did I say about this bag?

42:14.785 --> 42:17.037
- I've almost got it.
- What did I tell you?

42:17.037 --> 42:19.498
Face the fuck forward. Sit down.

42:19.498 --> 42:22.334
- Can you see that? What's going on?
- I don't know. I can't see.

42:22.835 --> 42:25.420
I fucking told you!

42:25.963 --> 42:27.631
- Don't fucking do that again!
- Oh, my God,

42:27.631 --> 42:30.384
- they're gonna get us all killed.
- Why say that?

42:30.384 --> 42:32.302
- What are they doing?
- Sit down, Lizzy.

42:32.302 --> 42:34.596
You don't say that in front of children.

42:34.596 --> 42:36.974
- Oh, fuck.
- I've gotta teach you a lesson.

42:37.933 --> 42:41.061
- It's all kicking off down there.
- Okay, this is our chance.

42:41.979 --> 42:43.438
I don't think I can--

42:44.940 --> 42:46.316
I don't think I can do it.

42:46.316 --> 42:48.527
I'm gonna teach you a fucking lesson now.

42:48.527 --> 42:50.279
Don't fucking touch it!

42:51.071 --> 42:52.614
Sit down!

42:53.198 --> 42:55.784
Hey, it's okay, babe.
Listen to Daddy, yeah?

43:01.456 --> 43:04.543
Stay calm! Be quiet.

43:08.463 --> 43:10.090
- The fuck are you doing?
- Yeah.

43:10.090 --> 43:12.259
Okay.

43:14.344 --> 43:16.180
- Sit the fuck down!
- Let me go.

43:16.180 --> 43:17.264
Okay.

43:19.766 --> 43:21.101
Oh, fuck.

43:28.400 --> 43:29.985
Leave him alone!

43:35.490 --> 43:39.328
...'cause I can't leave this aisle, can I?

43:43.498 --> 43:45.167
Shut the fuck up!

43:51.673 --> 43:55.344
Do not question me, okay?
Do not try it with me!

43:55.344 --> 43:56.720
None of you...

44:07.231 --> 44:12.569
Sit down! You, sit the fuck down!
Stay down! Sit down!

44:12.569 --> 44:13.862
Sit the fuck down!

44:22.204 --> 44:24.540
All of you, shut the fuck up!

44:28.377 --> 44:29.419
Face forward.

44:32.506 --> 44:35.425
Where is he?

44:36.927 --> 44:40.472
Do not fucking-- Stay down! Be quiet!

44:40.472 --> 44:41.974
Shut the fuck up!

44:47.855 --> 44:49.439
None of you fucking try me!

44:50.232 --> 44:51.525
Everyone, stay calm!

44:55.487 --> 44:57.281
Get back in your fucking seat!

44:59.116 --> 45:00.117
Back in your seat.

45:00.117 --> 45:01.493
Everyone, stay calm!

45:08.375 --> 45:09.376
Get out.

45:32.441 --> 45:33.692
Stay down!

45:47.456 --> 45:48.707
What's going on?

45:48.707 --> 45:52.419
Where is she? Your other one.
Where is she, pet?

45:53.837 --> 45:56.256
- Lizzy's gone. Lizzy.
- Little girl, she's gone missing.

45:56.256 --> 45:57.925
- David, get up and look.
- Lizzy!

46:05.974 --> 46:07.267
- ...she? Lizzy!
- Lizzy?

46:07.267 --> 46:10.521
- Please, help me look for her, everybody!
- Has anyone seen my daughter?

46:23.408 --> 46:26.203
- You, get the fuck out of here.
- Lizzy!

46:26.203 --> 46:28.789
It's Lizzy. A little girl. Lizzy.

46:29.373 --> 46:30.666
We know they're blanks.

46:38.382 --> 46:40.676
- She's about this big.
- She's about six years old.

46:40.676 --> 46:42.803
- Lizzy!
- Lizzy! Come out! Now!

46:45.097 --> 46:48.225
- Lizzy! Come on, babe. Lizzy!
- Get down.

46:48.225 --> 46:49.226
Lizzy!

46:49.226 --> 46:51.478
- Lizzy!
- Lizzy. Pet?

46:53.188 --> 46:55.065
Go on. Face forward.

46:55.065 --> 46:57.901
So, go on then. Pull the fucking trigger.
