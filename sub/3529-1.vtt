WEBVTT

00:11.797 --> 00:14.070
That the union between
King Henry of England

00:14.105 --> 00:16.018
and Catherine of Aragon

00:16.053 --> 00:18.415
Is declared null and void

00:21.205 --> 00:23.191
I want to present you as my future wife,

00:23.226 --> 00:25.399
and the future Queen of England

00:25.434 --> 00:29.490
We are gathered here together
to join in holy matrimony

00:29.525 --> 00:31.208
this man and this woman

00:31.243 --> 00:32.900
Now, My love,

00:32.935 --> 00:34.156
let me conceive

00:34.191 --> 00:36.221
and we will have a son.

00:36.819 --> 00:38.520
Here's to the Boleynâ€™s.

00:39.021 --> 00:41.122
Englandâ€™s new Queen.

00:43.324 --> 00:45.325
What of this girl? This putan,

00:45.326 --> 00:46.627
the Kings whore

00:46.728 --> 00:47.829
Anne Boleyn.

00:48.030 --> 00:49.230
Why doesnâ€™t someone

00:49.231 --> 00:50.432
just get rid of her

00:50.433 --> 00:51.733
I will never agree to judged by the Pope

00:51.734 --> 00:52.935
in this matter

00:53.036 --> 00:54.637
He can do what he likes in Rome

00:54.638 --> 00:55.638
I'll do what I like here

00:56.440 --> 00:58.441
Here is the submission of the clergy

00:58.742 --> 01:00.543
To your Majesty's will

01:02.345 --> 01:04.245
I am made head of the Church of England

01:04.247 --> 01:06.047
A last you have your right,

01:06.048 --> 01:07.249
and can do as you will.

01:09.151 --> 01:10.452
Mr. Cromwell -

01:10.453 --> 01:12.754
I'm appointing you Vice
Regent in spiritual matters

01:12.955 --> 01:15.156
I've never been interested in
reforming the Catholic Church,

01:15.157 --> 01:16.458
my only interest -

01:16.759 --> 01:18.460
is in destroying them

01:19.461 --> 01:21.162
We have had a great success

01:21.163 --> 01:22.764
In the swearing of
allegiance to your Majesty

01:22.765 --> 01:23.765
as head of the Church.

01:23.766 --> 01:25.267
But we cannot persuade

01:25.268 --> 01:26.769
Thomas Moore to swear to you

01:26.770 --> 01:28.570
There can be no compromise

01:29.072 --> 01:30.773
I beg you earnestly to pray for the King

01:31.174 --> 01:32.875
Tell him, I died his good servant.

01:32.976 --> 01:34.576
But God's first.

01:34.978 --> 01:36.178
Ahhhhh!

01:37.380 --> 01:38.780
And what of my daughter?

01:38.781 --> 01:40.682
What of Mary? May I see her?

01:41.284 --> 01:42.784
You are forbidden to communicate

01:42.785 --> 01:44.186
in any way with your mother

01:44.187 --> 01:45.388
from this day forward.

01:45.389 --> 01:46.889
I would reconcile you with your father

01:46.890 --> 01:47.891
If you will only

01:47.892 --> 01:49.593
accept me as Queen.

01:49.994 --> 01:51.995
I recognise no Queen, but my mother.

01:52.996 --> 01:54.097
Screams

01:54.698 --> 01:56.699
Her Majesty has given
birth to a baby girl.

01:56.800 --> 01:57.901
Princess of England... Elizabeth!

01:57.902 --> 01:59.603
I'm so sorry

01:59.604 --> 02:00.804
By God's grace,

02:00.805 --> 02:02.306
boys will follow

02:03.107 --> 02:04.108
From now on we must all be careful,

02:04.109 --> 02:05.610
not to lose the King's love.

02:05.911 --> 02:07.411
Or, everything is lost.

02:07.412 --> 02:09.013
for all of us.

02:11.315 --> 02:13.416
The hour of my death draws fast upon me

02:14.218 --> 02:16.019
my daughter you are our daughter Mary

02:17.120 --> 02:18.821
I beseech you to be a good father

02:19.322 --> 02:21.623
As long as Mary is alive,

02:21.624 --> 02:23.125
she could be Queen.

02:23.526 --> 02:25.227
Elizabeth, your daughter,

02:25.228 --> 02:26.629
will be made heir to the throne

02:26.630 --> 02:28.331
You're a happily married man Charles

02:29.032 --> 02:30.333
I envy you.

02:30.334 --> 02:31.734
I'm going have to attend on the King

02:31.735 --> 02:33.236
and that bitch of his at her coronation

02:33.237 --> 02:34.738
you cannot plead some indisposition?

02:35.139 --> 02:36.440
His majesty would remove my head

02:36.441 --> 02:37.941
even if I should be genuinely indisposed

02:37.942 --> 02:39.243
Giggle

02:39.244 --> 02:40.945
Your sister is a very
beautiful young woman

02:40.946 --> 02:42.747
Not as beautiful as her brother

02:42.748 --> 02:44.649
You've just come from another's bed

02:44.650 --> 02:46.150
Do not deny it.

02:46.151 --> 02:48.052
Very well
- I shan't

02:49.854 --> 02:51.755
Your Majesty, may I present my daughter

02:51.756 --> 02:53.557
Lady Jane Seymour

02:53.958 --> 02:55.459
Jane

02:55.960 --> 02:57.561
Imagine what it would mean for us

02:57.562 --> 02:58.562
If you did grow to love her.

02:58.964 --> 03:00.764
I wish there was a way I could remove

03:00.765 --> 03:02.366
mistress from among my ladies

03:02.667 --> 03:04.768
When you have given the
King his great desire,

03:04.769 --> 03:06.670
then you will have all
the power to deal with her

03:06.671 --> 03:08.172
as you like

03:08.973 --> 03:11.375
I am carrying the Kings son.

03:13.277 --> 03:14.777
I so much want a new beginning

03:14.778 --> 03:15.779
a Renaissance

03:16.980 --> 03:18.781
Will you let me kiss you Jane?

03:20.083 --> 03:21.884
Oh my God! What is this

03:21.885 --> 03:23.586
just when my baby is doing his business

03:23.987 --> 03:26.088
I find you wenching
with mistress Seymour

03:26.889 --> 03:28.390
Oh! No! No! No! No!

03:28.891 --> 03:30.292
You lost my boy!

03:30.693 --> 03:32.694
You have no one to blame
but yourself for this

03:34.296 --> 03:36.197
I have it on very good authority that
she and Thomas Wide were once lovers

03:36.898 --> 03:38.699
It's true that some man
came into the Queens Chamber

03:39.000 --> 03:40.401
It's all right

03:40.402 --> 03:42.203
I love you

03:42.204 --> 03:43.804
they were hugging and
kissing in a huddle

03:44.806 --> 03:46.907
You are both arrested for having
carnal knowledge of the Queen

03:47.208 --> 03:48.409
What!

03:48.410 --> 03:49.910
This the warrant for your arrest

03:49.911 --> 03:51.612
You are charged with committing adultery

03:52.013 --> 03:53.214
I want a date.

03:53.215 --> 03:54.916
I want it over with! Finished!

03:56.017 --> 03:58.419
Tell me about it. Did
you watch your son die?

03:59.320 --> 04:01.021
How about your daughter?

04:01.022 --> 04:02.623
Was it all worth it?

04:03.024 --> 04:04.525
I promise you that I'm going
to make such a reformation

04:04.526 --> 04:06.126
In this Kingdom

04:06.127 --> 04:07.728
That I shall be remembered eternally.

04:09.930 --> 04:11.731
I have no doubt whatsoever

04:11.732 --> 04:13.333
that Your Majestyâ€™s reign

04:13.368 --> 04:14.934
will always be remembered

04:16.435 --> 04:18.236
I believe with all my heart

04:18.738 --> 04:20.839
That I will take another wife

04:21.783 --> 04:23.484
May I kiss you Jane?

04:23.785 --> 04:25.286
Aren't you the King of England?

~ Season 3 - Episode 1 ~
"Civil Unrest"

06:08.392 --> 06:09.613
- Jane.

06:09.967 --> 06:11.353
- Your Majesty.

06:13.472 --> 06:15.222
We are come here together

06:15.436 --> 06:18.231
before god and these witnesses

06:18.356 --> 06:21.781
to join in Holy
matrimony Henry VIII,

06:21.906 --> 06:24.391
King of England and France,

06:24.516 --> 06:25.971
defender of the faith,

06:26.096 --> 06:28.581
Supreme Head of
the Church of England,

06:28.706 --> 06:31.311
and the Lady Jane Seymour.

06:31.436 --> 06:32.911
And if there be any among you

06:33.036 --> 06:34.701
who may imagine some impediments

06:34.826 --> 06:37.186
as to why they should
not be married,

06:37.856 --> 06:39.651
Let them now speak out,

06:39.776 --> 06:42.870
or forever hold their tongue.

07:05.216 --> 07:08.071
Thank you for my gift,
it's so very beautiful.

07:08.592 --> 07:11.400
I soon trust to thank you for mine.

07:15.676 --> 07:17.236
Shall we join in the dance?

07:37.502 --> 07:38.502
Music.

07:53.366 --> 07:55.216
- I feel guilty. -Why?

07:55.523 --> 07:58.823
Because sometimes I forget
about how beautiful you are.

08:04.676 --> 08:06.676
I think she'll make him happy.

08:07.096 --> 08:09.246
God's help, we'll all be happy now.

08:28.166 --> 08:30.191
I don't recognize you, my lady?

08:30.316 --> 08:31.665
Are you new at court?

08:31.790 --> 08:34.366
Yes, Sir.
I am to be a maid to her Majesty.

08:35.326 --> 08:36.436
What's your name?

08:37.046 --> 08:38.986
Lady Ursula Misseldon.

08:39.456 --> 08:40.716
You know who I am?

08:41.256 --> 08:44.541
You're Sir Francis Bryan.
I've heard about you.

08:44.666 --> 08:45.996
What have you heard?

08:47.036 --> 08:48.956
You like to board other man's boats.

08:49.262 --> 08:50.761
I trust that I shall be seeing

08:50.886 --> 08:53.316
a lot more of you, Lady Misseldon.

09:02.326 --> 09:04.007
Since both the King's daughters

09:04.132 --> 09:07.111
have been declared
illegimate and unfit to rule,

09:07.236 --> 09:09.581
we must trust the queen to
conceive a child quickly.

09:09.706 --> 09:11.591
I still fear, with Anne's death,

09:11.716 --> 09:14.516
we've lost a great friend
and a powerful supporter.

09:14.859 --> 09:16.922
If the new Queen favors
the Catholic religion,

09:17.047 --> 09:18.747
as she is rumored to do,

09:18.976 --> 09:21.190
then our whole reformation
is surely in jeopardy.

09:21.315 --> 09:22.386
What a suprise,

09:22.511 --> 09:24.207
you have such little
faith in the king.

09:24.332 --> 09:26.811
Unless we press ahead
the dissalution of those brothels

09:26.936 --> 09:28.866
and slaughter whores
of the conscience.

09:30.416 --> 09:31.906
The monasteries.

09:46.706 --> 09:50.521
In nomine Patris, et Filii,
et Spiritus Sancti. Amen

09:50.646 --> 09:54.650
Almighty and Everlasting God
give onto us the increase of faith

09:55.226 --> 09:58.601
hope and charity and that we may
obtain that which Thou dost promise,

09:58.726 --> 10:02.141
make us to love
that which Thou dost command

10:02.266 --> 10:04.221
through Jesus Christ, our lord.

10:04.346 --> 10:05.646
Amen.

10:09.156 --> 10:11.281
Madam, If I may,

10:11.406 --> 10:14.786
I have a wedding gift
for Your Majesty.

10:16.736 --> 10:19.436
It once belonged to Queen Katherine.

10:21.776 --> 10:22.891
Thank You.

10:23.016 --> 10:25.126
His Majesty, the King.

10:37.716 --> 10:41.266
- Wife. -Husband.

10:42.496 --> 10:44.703
I don't think we need
to proceed in public.

10:44.828 --> 10:46.028
Not this time.

10:49.766 --> 10:51.026
Majesty.

11:41.916 --> 11:44.276
Make way, the King's commissioners.

11:46.825 --> 11:48.496
Be assure everything
is accounted for.

11:48.621 --> 11:49.752
Yes, Dr. Frankish.

11:49.877 --> 11:52.036
Dr. Frankish,
here's a wealthy Madonna.

11:55.526 --> 11:56.816
Here is a fine one.

11:57.326 --> 12:01.330
Coat of silk, ton of jewels,
wealth property

12:02.086 --> 12:03.126
Well, Lady,

12:03.786 --> 12:05.616
are you stripped now?

12:17.766 --> 12:18.766
Mr. Aske.

12:25.106 --> 12:28.416
Look what they've done, John.
Just look.

12:29.826 --> 12:31.166
It's all Cromwell's doing.

12:32.076 --> 12:34.816
Cromwell and that sect
of heretics in London,

12:35.436 --> 12:36.666
that bustard.

12:37.684 --> 12:40.818
I'll tell you this Mr. Aske, people,
They're no longer willing to stand by,

12:40.943 --> 12:42.473
and watch their faith,

12:42.598 --> 12:44.276
and everything that they care for,

12:44.401 --> 12:46.631
being stripped away.
I heard just yesterday,

12:46.756 --> 12:49.251
that two of Cromwell's
commisioners were attacked

12:49.376 --> 12:51.531
in Lincolnshire.
And here in Yorkshire,

12:51.656 --> 12:53.201
and a man of the commons

12:53.326 --> 12:55.106
stood up in his own church

12:55.231 --> 12:57.425
and said go away to
follow the crosses.

12:57.550 --> 12:59.431
For what they've taken from us,

12:59.556 --> 13:01.496
we can follow them no more.

13:05.866 --> 13:08.256
What am I supposed to do, John?

13:10.286 --> 13:13.986
The commons here,
in Lincolnshire, everywhere.

13:15.646 --> 13:17.211
They're prepared to fight,

13:17.336 --> 13:18.706
to save what they love.

13:19.606 --> 13:20.941
But they need captains,

13:21.066 --> 13:25.070
they need clever,
educated man to lead them.

13:30.266 --> 13:32.706
I'm no leader, John.
Don't decide now.

13:33.426 --> 13:34.846
We'll call a meeting,

13:35.486 --> 13:36.796
then decide.

13:42.656 --> 13:44.016
For the love of God.

13:52.096 --> 13:53.396
Take a look at that

13:55.566 --> 13:58.276
Our commisioners found
it in Sawly Abbey.

14:03.826 --> 14:05.436
How was it done?

14:06.056 --> 14:07.156
See it yourself.

14:10.636 --> 14:13.041
People thought
the saint's bones were alive

14:13.166 --> 14:15.301
use it work for benedictions.

14:15.426 --> 14:19.430
If they pay a little money
they had to the church and to Rome

14:21.446 --> 14:23.331
how do our reforms progress?

14:23.456 --> 14:24.673
As you know, my lord.

14:24.798 --> 14:26.591
Parliament has now voted
for the suppression

14:26.716 --> 14:29.151
of all the small monastery houses
and the commisioners are upon

14:29.276 --> 14:32.976
and about their businesses
in nearly every county in England...

14:33.435 --> 14:34.641
Much opposition?

14:34.766 --> 14:36.716
Not as much
as we might have expected.

14:38.536 --> 14:40.586
Why should we have expected it?

14:42.196 --> 14:44.171
People conceive for themselves

14:44.296 --> 14:47.281
that all these houses
should be condemned

14:47.406 --> 14:50.501
for their manifest sin:
carnal and abundable living

14:50.626 --> 14:52.351
I was told, one anecdote among many

14:52.476 --> 14:55.041
When our commisioners entered
the London houses of the Crossed Friars

14:55.166 --> 14:57.741
They found the prayer himself,
in babel disorder.

14:57.866 --> 14:59.791
Both stunned and naked.

14:59.916 --> 15:02.286
They often bribes to go away.

15:04.036 --> 15:05.911
It is true that ordinary
people are so greedy

15:06.036 --> 15:07.911
upon these houses when
they are suppressed.

15:08.036 --> 15:11.911
They scavenge in the night
and day untill nothing is left.

15:12.036 --> 15:16.036
They even take the books, to use for
paper in their houses of easement.

15:19.506 --> 15:22.011
How about the gains
of King's treasure?

15:22.449 --> 15:25.164
So far, by my reckoning,
we have already doubled

15:25.289 --> 15:27.839
the King's income
and taken in possesion

15:27.964 --> 15:30.463
of the monastic lands
worth many millions of pounds.

15:31.806 --> 15:33.401
Millions?

15:33.526 --> 15:35.336
Yes, Mr. Secretary.

15:42.226 --> 15:45.006
Sir Edward Seymour.

15:50.196 --> 15:51.196
Sir Edward,

15:51.876 --> 15:55.091
as the brother of His
Majesty's beloved wife, Jane,

15:55.216 --> 15:57.811
It is his Majesty's
pleasure today to creat you

15:57.936 --> 16:00.531
Viscount Beauchamp
of Hache in Somerset,

16:00.656 --> 16:03.041
also to appoint you
a governor of Jersy

16:03.166 --> 16:05.686
and Chancellor of North Wales.

16:08.016 --> 16:10.891
Your Majesty, I'm deeply honoured.

16:11.016 --> 16:13.171
And I assure your Majesty
that I would labor

16:13.296 --> 16:15.451
unremittingly in
your Majesty's interest,

16:15.576 --> 16:19.580
in the hope of repaying
the great trust you've shown in me.

16:25.466 --> 16:29.470
My lord,
here are your Letters patent.

16:30.896 --> 16:32.931
May I congratulate
you on your elevation.

16:33.056 --> 16:35.226
Mr. Secratary.

16:36.296 --> 16:39.846
Thomas,
what are the businesses there?

16:41.376 --> 16:43.491
Your Majesty has received
a letter from the Emperor,

16:43.616 --> 16:45.856
congratulating your new marriage.

16:46.337 --> 16:48.250
Since he's no further impediment,

16:48.375 --> 16:51.271
he's very anxious to
become a new accommodation.

16:51.396 --> 16:52.696
Good. What else?

16:53.156 --> 16:56.741
The Lady Mary has also
written to you, Majesty

16:56.866 --> 16:58.316
What does she want?

16:58.536 --> 17:01.511
She writes, that it is time
now to forget the unhappy past,

17:01.636 --> 17:04.611
she begs to be taken by
your Majesty's forgiveness

17:04.736 --> 17:07.711
and humbly beseeches you to remember

17:07.836 --> 17:10.810
that I am a humbled
woman and your child.

17:10.935 --> 17:12.861
I'll never take her back.

17:12.986 --> 17:15.981
Not until she first
submit herself to me

17:16.106 --> 17:19.106
the subject of his mother's
marriage and surprint

17:21.746 --> 17:23.546
You'll send the delegation

17:23.981 --> 17:26.080
if she trully wants to
forget the unhappy past,

17:26.205 --> 17:28.181
then she can stop by signing it.

17:28.306 --> 17:29.831
Majesty.

17:29.956 --> 17:31.616
Groom.

17:35.926 --> 17:39.376
Ah, Sir Francis.
I have some good news for you.

17:40.006 --> 17:42.031
His majesty has agreed
to your appointment

17:42.156 --> 17:44.181
as a gentleman of the Privy Chamber.

17:44.306 --> 17:45.996
I'm sure I know. Thanks for that.

17:47.686 --> 17:50.426
I may have a small
job for you, soon.

17:52.566 --> 17:53.821
Excellency. Your Majesty.

17:53.946 --> 17:57.336
Come with me. There's someone
I wish to present you to.

18:00.646 --> 18:04.131
Queen Jane. Allow me to introduce
his Excellency Eustace Chapuys,

18:04.256 --> 18:07.866
Ambassador to
the emperor Charles V, Spain.

18:10.056 --> 18:11.281
Excellency.

18:11.406 --> 18:14.336
I leave you to talk in private.

18:18.436 --> 18:20.951
Your Majesty,
may I congratulate on your marriage.

18:21.076 --> 18:23.716
Wish you good health and prosperity.

18:24.916 --> 18:27.491
Although the device of the lady
who proceeded you

18:27.616 --> 18:30.191
on the throne was the most happy.

18:30.316 --> 18:34.320
I have no doubt that it is you,
yourself who will realise that mortal.

18:35.716 --> 18:37.921
Thank you, Excellency.

18:38.046 --> 18:41.271
I know that the emperor
will rejoice of

18:41.396 --> 18:44.621
such a virtual ascent
and amiable queen on the throne.

18:44.746 --> 18:48.750
I must tell you it would be
impossible for me to overstate the joy

18:49.756 --> 18:52.641
and happiness which each
Englsih men I have met

18:52.766 --> 18:55.796
have expressed to me on
hearing of your marriage.

18:56.166 --> 19:00.170
Especially, as it is said, that you're
a peace-maker who'll be continually

19:00.706 --> 19:04.710
trying to persuade his majesty to
restore his daughter Mary to favor.

19:05.246 --> 19:06.741
I promise you, excellency.

19:06.866 --> 19:10.741
That I would continue to
show favor to the Lady Mary.

19:10.866 --> 19:13.040
And do my best to deserve
the title of peace-maker

19:13.165 --> 19:14.866
you so gallantly have given me.

19:15.446 --> 19:18.631
If you do so,
I think you'll find Madam that

19:18.756 --> 19:22.076
without the pain of labour,
and childbirth,

19:22.696 --> 19:24.971
you'll gain a treasure
of the daughter

19:25.096 --> 19:27.021
who may please you even more

19:27.146 --> 19:29.196
than your own children by the King.

19:31.424 --> 19:33.612
I can only say again, Excellency.

19:33.737 --> 19:35.637
That I will do my best
to restore the peace

19:35.762 --> 19:38.362
between the King
and his eldest daughter.

19:39.216 --> 19:41.236
- Ambassordor -Madam.

19:44.036 --> 19:45.736
Madam.

19:53.970 --> 19:56.315
You're the first
ambassordor she's received.

19:56.440 --> 19:58.650
She is not yet used
to see such audiences.

19:58.775 --> 20:00.527
But it is true what they say.

20:00.652 --> 20:02.352
She is kind and amiable,

20:02.690 --> 20:04.761
and much inclined towards peace.

20:04.886 --> 20:06.226
I swear, for example,

20:07.006 --> 20:09.741
she would strive to prevent me
taking part in a foreign war.

20:09.866 --> 20:12.736
If only to avoid the fear
and pain of separation.

20:14.096 --> 20:16.951
If you are on war,
your majesty, against whom?

20:17.076 --> 20:20.001
I was talking hypothetically.

20:20.126 --> 20:23.176
Surely you'll do that youself,
your excellency.

20:44.519 --> 20:47.871
Thanks for coming. Thank you.

20:49.993 --> 20:52.416
Friends! Friends.

20:52.936 --> 20:55.941
We've come here,
so you can listen to and talk to

20:56.066 --> 20:59.206
this good man, Mr. Robert Aske.

21:00.096 --> 21:02.001
Now some of you have
already known him,

21:02.126 --> 21:04.166
he is the Duke of
Northampton's legal man.

21:04.914 --> 21:06.791
He's always been
honest and fair minded

21:06.916 --> 21:08.850
in these dealings
with the commons so...

21:08.975 --> 21:11.986
Mr. Aske can speak for himself.

21:14.216 --> 21:16.156
Ladies and Gentlmen.

21:17.516 --> 21:20.651
Now, tell me what is your want.

21:20.776 --> 21:24.780
Mr Aske, all of our faith
days were abolished and gone.

21:26.966 --> 21:30.336
Should it pleased the King's grace
that we might have our Holy days back.

21:31.076 --> 21:33.881
We want our abbeyes restored.

21:34.006 --> 21:36.821
And demand that this
advance of heresy be halted.

21:36.946 --> 21:40.950
We want this new heretic Bishop
like Cranmer be casted off.

21:42.256 --> 21:46.260
Even Cromwell to be surplanted
by man of noble birth.

21:51.236 --> 21:54.151
We hear rumors, Mr. Aske,
that new taxes levy's against us

21:54.276 --> 21:57.191
on our cattle, and our christenings,

21:57.316 --> 22:00.231
on our marriages, and our births.

22:00.356 --> 22:04.360
Aske, they even destroy our perish
churches and steal our treasures.

22:08.766 --> 22:10.961
All right, gentlemen.
All right, gentlemen.

22:11.086 --> 22:13.291
What do you reckon you
can do to stop them.

22:13.416 --> 22:17.420
Mr. Aske, before our lands, our
good to their houses.

22:19.146 --> 22:23.150
Are taken from by the church
commissioners. We'll fight.

22:24.886 --> 22:28.890
And we'll die,
die after full ultimate, Mr. Aske.

22:33.266 --> 22:34.451
I know you are angry.

22:34.576 --> 22:38.580
The destruction of the abbeys is
a terrible and criminal thing.

22:39.426 --> 22:43.430
Since that represents by that very
presence and exotic ideal to of all of us.

22:45.146 --> 22:49.150
But gentlemen, this call to arms,
to rebellion against the king's grace

22:50.526 --> 22:53.906
is something which are
my conscience I cannot agree to.

22:57.056 --> 23:01.060
Since the King is our body and soul.

23:01.466 --> 23:05.470
Then an attack upon him is an attack upon
the commonwealth and upon God himself.

23:05.886 --> 23:08.091
Did you hear that, my mates?

23:08.216 --> 23:10.801
The gentry doesn't care for us.

23:10.926 --> 23:13.621
Christ die for the poor.

23:13.746 --> 23:15.886
Do you remember that, Mr. Aske?

23:21.706 --> 23:23.186
Lady Misseldon, Your Majesty

23:23.942 --> 23:27.390
- Lady Misseldon
- Your Majesty

23:27.736 --> 23:30.091
Do your duties
honournably and virtuesly

23:30.216 --> 23:34.220
and remember,
you are all bound to serve and obey.

23:35.066 --> 23:38.176
Lady Rochford?

23:38.736 --> 23:39.736
Your Majesty.

23:40.216 --> 23:42.116
Please.

23:43.386 --> 23:47.281
I ask to see you.

23:47.406 --> 23:51.410
I know that the things have not gone well
for you since your husband was executed.

23:53.105 --> 23:55.105
I have been utterly abandoned.

23:55.781 --> 23:59.236
I feel I was condemed
because of what George did.

24:00.346 --> 24:03.201
Even Mr Cromwell has refused
to answer my letters.

24:03.938 --> 24:08.023
Nothing was your fault. George
Bolyen was his own keeper.

24:10.330 --> 24:12.480
I want you to come back to court.

24:13.496 --> 24:16.516
And I'd like to appoint you
my principal lady in waiting.

24:19.466 --> 24:21.426
I hope you'll accept this position.

24:22.672 --> 24:26.071
- Thank you, Your Majesty. -Well then, lady Rochford?

24:27.155 --> 24:28.555
All is well again.

24:30.269 --> 24:31.569
All is mended up

24:43.736 --> 24:45.552
Sir Francis Bryan, my lady.

24:48.816 --> 24:50.414
Lady Mary. My lord.

24:51.096 --> 24:53.526
I'm very glad you've come to see me.

24:54.176 --> 24:57.021
I've written a letter congratulating
the King on his marriage.

24:57.146 --> 24:59.991
And begging leave to
wait upon queen Jane

25:00.116 --> 25:02.971
or do her grace such services
would please her to command me.

25:03.400 --> 25:05.451
I'm afraid, Lady Mary.

25:05.576 --> 25:07.931
I've not come here to
discuss pleasentaries.

25:08.056 --> 25:10.421
His Majesty urged you to sign this.

25:11.023 --> 25:13.661
- What is it? -A list of articles.

25:14.236 --> 25:16.611
Recognising the King
as Head of the Church,

25:16.736 --> 25:19.111
and your mother's marriage
just incestuous and unlawful.

25:19.236 --> 25:22.471
You must also renounce Rome and

25:22.596 --> 25:25.831
free acknowledged
of your illegitamacy

25:25.956 --> 25:29.960
If you not sign, I'm afraid Mr Secretary
Cromwell can not guarantee your safety.

25:40.456 --> 25:44.460
However much I love my father,
your grace.

25:44.816 --> 25:48.191
And would do anything to please
and satisfy him, I still cannot

25:48.316 --> 25:51.816
risk my mortal soul for
the favor of an unearthly King.

25:52.936 --> 25:56.676
You're an unfitlial daughter.

25:58.276 --> 26:01.021
Since you're not
submit to your father.

26:01.146 --> 26:04.016
He may yet procceed
against you for treason.

26:05.096 --> 26:08.706
No, no he would not.

26:09.356 --> 26:11.991
- I cannot believe it. -Listen to me.

26:12.116 --> 26:14.616
I tell you

26:15.105 --> 26:16.655
if you're my daugher,

26:16.889 --> 26:19.661
I would smash
your head against the wall

26:19.786 --> 26:21.446
until it is soft as a boiled apple.

26:21.931 --> 26:23.331
Do you understand?

26:26.186 --> 26:28.686
Lady Mary.

26:38.856 --> 26:42.026
I've been discussing plans for
your coronation with Mr Holbein

26:42.858 --> 26:45.052
Have you ever heard of
the centre of Venice?

26:45.177 --> 26:46.527
No, Your Majesty.

26:46.792 --> 26:49.561
It's a ship.
In which the Doge travels out

26:49.686 --> 26:52.996
into the Lagoon every year to
renew its marriage while the sea

26:53.616 --> 26:57.620
It's a magnificant thing.
The dawn will gold and bronze, statues,

26:58.026 --> 27:02.030
Neptune, sea lions and other
fantastic sea creatures...

27:02.986 --> 27:04.631
And I'm going to build it.

27:04.756 --> 27:06.401
And you're going go travel in it,

27:06.526 --> 27:08.306
from Greenwich to the city,

27:09.106 --> 27:12.836
where you'll be crowned,
Queen Jane of England.

27:13.446 --> 27:15.527
Your Majesty, I...
I don't know what to say.

27:15.652 --> 27:17.401
You don't have to say anything.

27:17.526 --> 27:21.530
It will be the most fabulous coronation
any English Queen has ever had,

27:23.616 --> 27:25.476
that I promise you.

27:28.706 --> 27:30.879
Your Majesty. Forgive me.

27:31.191 --> 27:32.730
But I've heard Your Majesty

27:32.855 --> 27:34.878
make some proceedings
against the Lady Mary.

27:35.003 --> 27:37.099
With all my heart I beg you not to.

27:51.776 --> 27:53.426
Are you out of your senses?

27:55.946 --> 27:57.956
Don't talk of such matters again.

28:12.926 --> 28:13.996
Jane,

28:14.884 --> 28:16.931
I have another wedding gift for you.

28:18.576 --> 28:19.936
I hope you like it.

28:36.406 --> 28:37.706
Thank you Your Majesty.

28:39.196 --> 28:41.806
Oh I love him, he's so pretty.

29:09.676 --> 29:10.926
Lady Misseldon.

29:11.151 --> 29:12.251
Sir Francis.

29:16.466 --> 29:18.576
- I hope I didn't alarm you. -No sir.

29:19.358 --> 29:21.571
You left me a note
that you wanted to see me?

29:21.696 --> 29:23.659
Yes, I did.

29:24.846 --> 29:25.866
About what?

29:27.166 --> 29:28.281
I was wondering

29:28.406 --> 29:30.476
if you'd like to become my mistress.

29:31.946 --> 29:35.436
Sir, I'm already
engage to be married.

29:37.888 --> 29:38.968
To whom?

29:39.816 --> 29:41.694
Sir Robert Tavistock

29:43.076 --> 29:46.986
Can he afford to buy
you gifts like this?

29:56.476 --> 29:57.916
I didn't think so.

29:58.608 --> 30:00.292
But if it's more important to you

30:00.417 --> 30:02.910
to keep your virgin then
keep it for what it's worth.

30:03.035 --> 30:05.185
And I swear I wouldn't bother you

30:05.436 --> 30:07.376
or your conscience ever again.

30:10.536 --> 30:12.166
I haven't decided yet.

30:15.006 --> 30:17.901
How can I renounce Rome
or my mother's marriage.

30:18.026 --> 30:19.941
After all of my mother's sufferings.

30:20.066 --> 30:21.301
I understand.

30:21.426 --> 30:24.676
But may I suggest that you
could sign the document.

30:25.226 --> 30:28.146
And then make what is
called a protestation apart.

30:28.826 --> 30:32.401
That is secretly foresware
your submission before witnesses.

30:32.526 --> 30:34.446
Is that not hypocrisy?

30:34.966 --> 30:37.481
Surely the emperor's against
my signing such a document

30:37.606 --> 30:39.346
and the Holy Father.

30:45.566 --> 30:46.596
Lady Mary,

30:47.796 --> 30:49.436
I must tell you in honesty that

30:51.116 --> 30:52.801
that the emperor's
no longer inclined to

30:52.926 --> 30:54.976
interfere any further
in this matter.

30:56.356 --> 30:58.466
After all,
you are not his subject and

31:00.086 --> 31:03.066
and since he is seeking
a new alliance with the king,

31:03.806 --> 31:05.481
he would in truth be most reluctant

31:05.606 --> 31:07.306
to offend him in any way.

31:08.986 --> 31:10.086
Then, I'm...

31:11.863 --> 31:13.055
on my own?

31:21.346 --> 31:22.846
What if I do not sign it?

31:24.706 --> 31:27.546
It is very possible
that the king would put you to death.

31:38.456 --> 31:39.456
Well

31:41.316 --> 31:43.846
- Do you...do you not want to read it first? -No.

31:46.316 --> 31:49.876
Only I ask if you can (come to) pray
for absolution for what I've done.

32:00.506 --> 32:01.736
So long as I live,

32:02.576 --> 32:04.346
I will never forgive myself.

32:12.186 --> 32:13.541
Father Pole?

32:13.666 --> 32:15.276
Yes Your Eminence.

32:16.846 --> 32:18.476
I'm Cardinal Von Waldburg.

32:19.656 --> 32:23.660
How long have you been as the servant
adhere in Rome, Father Pole?

32:23.785 --> 32:25.461
Almost a year Your Eminence.

32:25.586 --> 32:27.801
I left England when
to became clear that

32:27.926 --> 32:31.930
the king meant to break his obedience
to see of Roman, our Holy Father.

32:32.076 --> 32:35.676
The death of whore Anne Boleyn
is perhaps providential.

32:35.956 --> 32:38.681
And His Holiness prays
that King Henry would

32:38.806 --> 32:42.011
grasp this divine opportunity
for reconciliation.

32:42.136 --> 32:43.631
Just one gesture,

32:43.756 --> 32:46.491
of he sounds to see of Rome,
however small,

32:46.616 --> 32:49.911
will allow him to leave
the threat of excommunication.

32:50.036 --> 32:51.590
Your Eminence believe me,

32:51.715 --> 32:55.415
that is something that the faithful
of England are praying for.

32:55.866 --> 32:59.031
My mother,
Lady Salisbury has written to me

32:59.156 --> 33:01.651
expressing her hope
that the new queen is

33:01.776 --> 33:03.551
in her heart a true Catholic.

33:03.676 --> 33:06.696
Perhaps your mother
could do more than hope.

33:07.336 --> 33:09.355
And perhaps you yourself Father Pole

33:09.480 --> 33:11.891
might've considering
returning to England.

33:12.016 --> 33:15.106
In order to influence events there.

33:17.776 --> 33:19.146
You see, Father Pole,

33:20.036 --> 33:22.256
I know who you really are.

33:27.176 --> 33:30.886
Here is the real Danae?

33:32.616 --> 33:36.620
She would kindle
your lust even higher

33:37.966 --> 33:41.818
One touch,
one mere touch of her body,

33:46.025 --> 33:49.820
and your limbs will
melt in the fire.

33:54.456 --> 33:55.746
The necklace suits you,

33:56.906 --> 33:58.236
and you're adored.

34:31.516 --> 34:34.166
In nomine Patris, et Filii,
et Spiritus Sancti. Amen

34:36.606 --> 34:39.998
Ave Maria, gratia plena,
Dominus tecum

34:41.036 --> 34:43.670
Your Majesty has received
a letter from Lady Bryan,

34:43.795 --> 34:45.896
governors to the Lady Elizabeth.

34:46.056 --> 34:48.341
Apparently the child has
outgrown her clothes.

34:48.466 --> 34:50.880
Lady Bryan asks if Your
Majesty would permit

34:51.005 --> 34:52.690
her to purchase new ones.

34:52.815 --> 34:55.665
Why should I?
I don't believe she is my child.

34:55.801 --> 34:58.391
The whole world knows their father's
a traitor Henry Norris

34:58.516 --> 35:01.066
and their mother was a whore.
What else?

35:02.186 --> 35:06.190
There's letters,
the submission of the Lady Mary.

35:16.991 --> 35:20.171
You will make arrangements for myself
and the Queen to meet with her.

35:20.296 --> 35:22.287
Not here and not publicly.

35:22.666 --> 35:24.566
We will go to her residence.

35:25.706 --> 35:28.156
There're rumors of
plague in the city.

35:28.296 --> 35:30.746
Coronation would
have to be postponed.

35:32.246 --> 35:33.246
Your Majesty.

35:34.836 --> 35:35.836
Thomas.

35:37.306 --> 35:39.506
Mr. Richard showed me the figures.

35:39.906 --> 35:41.906
I'm very pleased with you Tom.

35:42.426 --> 35:43.946
I will shortly prove it.

36:03.466 --> 36:04.726
Lady Rochford.

36:08.446 --> 36:09.846
Yes, Your Majesty.

36:10.416 --> 36:12.116
Take this to Lady Bryan,

36:12.876 --> 36:15.201
tell her to use it buy clothes
for the Lady Elisabeth.

36:15.326 --> 36:16.376
Yes, Madam.

36:17.336 --> 36:19.809
And you must think of
a gift for the Lady Mary.

36:19.934 --> 36:22.384
I'm looking so forward
to meeting her.

36:22.656 --> 36:24.666
Your Majesty is very kind.

36:27.506 --> 36:28.721
Lady Rochford,

36:28.846 --> 36:31.861
it's not your fault
that your husband betrayed you.

36:31.986 --> 36:33.983
Nor is it Mary's fault
or Elizabeth's fault

36:34.108 --> 36:35.658
to be born of a king.

36:36.026 --> 36:38.029
Women are much put
upon in this world.

36:38.154 --> 36:41.654
It's my desire as much
as I can to promote their interests.

36:42.616 --> 36:43.841
I must do it quietly.

36:43.966 --> 36:45.716
But I will do it all the same.

36:46.636 --> 36:48.136
And I trust you'd help me.

36:49.786 --> 36:50.976
Yes, Your Majesty.

37:03.526 --> 37:04.945
What's your name, man?

37:05.070 --> 37:06.967
Charlie, sir. Charlie Roll

37:08.126 --> 37:10.482
- Trade? -Shepherd.

37:12.496 --> 37:14.266
Mr. Secretary Cromwell.

37:24.506 --> 37:25.556
Kneel.

37:28.036 --> 37:29.688
Do you know well about it, Charlie?

37:29.813 --> 37:31.163
Yes, Captain Aske

37:32.166 --> 37:33.276
We're not rebels,

37:33.936 --> 37:35.011
we're Pilgrimages

37:35.136 --> 37:37.366
And we have a pilgrimage to go on.

37:38.466 --> 37:39.992
If you want to join us

37:40.117 --> 37:42.894
then you shall swear to
be true to our mighty God.

37:43.066 --> 37:44.896
To Christ Catholic Church.

37:45.586 --> 37:47.586
To our sovereign lord, the king.

37:48.086 --> 37:51.136
And to the commons of this realm,
so help you God.

37:52.436 --> 37:53.486
I do swear.

37:56.386 --> 37:57.686
Wear this badge.

37:57.970 --> 38:00.170
It show the five wounds of Christ.

38:01.116 --> 38:04.336
To prove that the commons
will fight in Christ cause.

38:06.806 --> 38:07.956
Yes, captain.

38:09.206 --> 38:11.596
- God bless you, Charlie. -Sir.

38:18.786 --> 38:21.065
Arise, Sir Thomas Cromwell,

38:21.366 --> 38:24.026
also Baron Cromwell of Wimbledon.

38:25.846 --> 38:27.416
And from this day forth,

38:29.239 --> 38:30.544
Lord Privy Seal.

38:39.696 --> 38:40.696
Majesty.

38:56.036 --> 38:58.036
Your Grace. Your Grace.

39:04.056 --> 39:05.196
May I, son?

39:13.426 --> 39:14.876
God be with you Lad

39:15.463 --> 39:17.213
Your Majesty is too kind.

39:17.376 --> 39:21.380
Mary, gifts like these are easy
compared with gifts of a heart.

39:22.077 --> 39:23.999
It gives more pleasure
than I can say

39:24.124 --> 39:26.574
to see you reconcile
with your father.

39:45.856 --> 39:46.856
- Mary.

39:47.322 --> 39:48.322
- Mary.

40:09.696 --> 40:11.746
Here is enough for
a thousand crowns.

40:12.556 --> 40:14.976
If you need anything
else you need only ask.

40:17.396 --> 40:19.076
Thank you, Your Majesty.

40:22.376 --> 40:23.376
Father.

40:28.064 --> 40:29.914
Yes, father.

41:00.006 --> 41:01.851
Mary's so sweet and affectional.

41:01.976 --> 41:03.666
She's everything I heard should be.

41:05.196 --> 41:07.655
It seems to be no wonder
she's so marvelous and beloved

41:07.780 --> 41:11.130
for her virtue and goodness
in the hearts of the people.

41:11.896 --> 41:14.956
Your Majesty must invite her
to the court, show her off.

41:20.771 --> 41:21.921
Your Majesty?

41:23.456 --> 41:25.406
Why were you not speak to me?

41:25.986 --> 41:27.736
Because I'm disappointed.

41:28.980 --> 41:29.980
Why?

41:31.086 --> 41:33.606
I'm disappointed because
you're not yet with child.

41:46.506 --> 41:50.510
Lord, my lord, my lord.

41:53.569 --> 41:55.351
We have come here in great haste.

41:55.476 --> 41:58.224
To tell you that the great part of the
north as well as part of Lincolnshire

41:58.349 --> 42:01.449
have risen in sudden
rebellion against His Majesty.

42:05.496 --> 42:07.671
There are master of
commons everywhere.

42:07.796 --> 42:11.081
The beacons of rebellion burning
their own light to cross the hills.

42:11.206 --> 42:12.528
Just four days ago,

42:12.653 --> 42:14.741
while we're collecting
taxes and hectinsome

42:14.866 --> 42:16.621
We were set upon by an angry mob

42:16.746 --> 42:19.331
They captured one of
the Commissioners call Nicolas Bello.

42:19.456 --> 42:21.141
Pull him down from his hourse

42:21.266 --> 42:23.636
and beat him to death
with their stave.

42:24.226 --> 42:26.901
Among them, my lord,
we saw armed priests.

42:27.026 --> 42:28.604
Urging on these rebellion's names

42:28.729 --> 42:30.257
and cries'kill them, kill them'.

42:30.382 --> 42:32.331
Then we heard another man,
william Lichie

42:32.456 --> 42:34.441
who is known to be
your servant Mr. Cromwell

42:34.566 --> 42:36.576
have been hanged from a tree

42:38.466 --> 42:41.581
and what these Rebels said they want

42:41.706 --> 42:45.466
so far I can tell you,
they want to keep their holy days

42:46.126 --> 42:49.886
they want monasteries restored
and their church unelested, and...

42:50.766 --> 42:51.916
no more taxed

42:53.193 --> 42:56.140
I heard they declared
they prospaid with their journey.

42:56.265 --> 42:58.684
They intend to kill
you, my Lord Crownwell

42:58.809 --> 43:01.716
4 or 5 bishops,
and Chancellor Richie

43:03.356 --> 43:07.301
as deviced taken church goods,
and tearing down churches

43:07.426 --> 43:11.151
why dont the local Gentry intervince
and serpress these traitors and wait

43:11.276 --> 43:14.187
surely they want to protect
their lands than Holy Days

43:14.312 --> 43:17.562
they tried, but the Rebels
then come back even greater

43:18.826 --> 43:21.991
some say, my lord Crownwell,
they are not hundreds

43:22.116 --> 43:25.611
but thousands religion rebelions
against the King's Church reforms

43:25.736 --> 43:29.740
why did you know, you are suposed
to know everything that goes on here

43:30.306 --> 43:33.591
you told me there was little opposition,
on the contrary.

43:33.716 --> 43:37.431
You told me that most people was
glad to see such places dissolved

43:37.997 --> 43:39.197
you were wrong

43:39.781 --> 43:43.049
you didnot know anything, knave

43:45.176 --> 43:47.430
sit down, write this

43:56.506 --> 43:58.989
we take it as greatest unkindness,
that our common

43:59.114 --> 44:02.106
unfearist objects should rise
agasint without any grounds

44:03.346 --> 44:06.606
As for taking the goods from perish
Church which is never intended

44:07.346 --> 44:10.531
yet even it had been intended...
True subjects

44:10.656 --> 44:13.976
would have not dealt with me,
Their Princess in such Violence

44:14.566 --> 44:17.016
but would petition
me for that purpose

44:18.196 --> 44:22.200
now I command you Rebels to go home,
and say no more

44:24.616 --> 44:28.620
and remember your allegiance, you are
duly bound to to obey me, your King

44:31.576 --> 44:34.626
both by God's Commoments,
and by the law of nature

44:44.826 --> 44:46.726
all commands, stick together

44:48.636 --> 44:51.236
now it's the time to arise,
for else ever

44:53.428 --> 44:56.375
so forwards, forwrds to York

44:57.346 --> 44:59.381
Forwards in pain of death

45:00.246 --> 45:04.250
Forwards in God's Name, Forwards.

45:07.926 --> 45:10.961
Writing to the Gentry of Yorkshire

45:11.086 --> 45:15.090
reminding them of their duties to suppress
these traitors, penalties in not doing so

45:20.426 --> 45:24.430
so any case, for suspending the work of
church commisioners, until rebels...

45:27.644 --> 45:29.894
no, the only way to beat the king's

45:35.956 --> 45:38.871
authority into the hands
of rude people of North

45:38.996 --> 45:41.911
is to show them King's intend
to continue with reformation

45:42.036 --> 45:45.086
and correction religion
whatever they say

45:50.866 --> 45:52.606
what ever they do

45:58.950 --> 45:59.950
yes

46:00.916 --> 46:01.821
my lord

46:01.946 --> 46:05.101
the Rebels have taken Lincoln

46:05.226 --> 46:08.005
the Rebels flag flies over city gate

46:08.893 --> 46:12.329
and more of them are
now marching on York

46:16.346 --> 46:17.596
My God, Help us

46:21.276 --> 46:25.280
When I was 5, my mother and I were
taken accross London, into the tower

46:27.046 --> 46:28.781
there was a rebelion
against my father

46:30.124 --> 46:33.050
The Cornish rebels
reached the city walls,

46:33.786 --> 46:36.136
and inside everything was panic, fear

46:38.429 --> 46:41.079
with no news at all,
nor army of my father

46:45.356 --> 46:48.356
my mother tried to remain
calm, she was terrified

46:53.736 --> 46:54.736
So was I,

46:58.476 --> 47:00.926
I was sure we were
both going to be killed

47:07.796 --> 47:10.303
I'm appointing you command
of the Royal forces,

47:10.428 --> 47:12.631
you will arrive North
as soon as possible

47:12.756 --> 47:16.760
you will find guns and ordnances
of hunger, but don't tarry there

47:17.726 --> 47:21.730
No, Your Majesty, I will do all
Your Majesty Commands and more

47:24.826 --> 47:26.521
these rebels are our traitors,
Charles

47:26.646 --> 47:28.466
full of wretched
and devilish intense

47:30.666 --> 47:33.641
they must be punished,

47:33.766 --> 47:36.866
for their detestable and unmature sin
of rebellion against their Sirvior

47:39.046 --> 47:43.050
just as my father,
punish the cornishmen.

47:43.846 --> 47:45.831
Charles, What is going on

47:45.956 --> 47:49.960
- Leave us. -Yes Your Grace.

47:51.786 --> 47:55.790
His Majesty has charged me would
lead his army against North Rebels

47:56.346 --> 48:00.350
You are not to worry, I will have my
back enough men and arms to subdue them

48:02.886 --> 48:06.716
easily, I have his Majesty's promise

48:07.426 --> 48:09.961
I hope to God, He keeps it

48:10.086 --> 48:12.546
I'm happy to accept this charge

48:13.866 --> 48:17.041
Crownwell is being
blamed for everything,

48:17.166 --> 48:20.466
and the Rebels is demanding
his head with God's help

48:21.186 --> 48:25.006
I may will be able to deliver it

49:02.376 --> 49:05.556
The Lord Privy Seal

49:27.266 --> 49:30.081
I'll despatch
Duke of Surffolk to the Royal Army

49:30.206 --> 49:33.946
If we need to send the second
army to destroy the rebels

49:34.596 --> 49:36.216
Yes, Your Mejesty

49:38.366 --> 49:39.891
unless they disperse

49:40.016 --> 49:43.111
and said 100 of their ringleaders
to the Duke of Surffolk

49:43.236 --> 49:46.466
of with halters around their necks

49:49.186 --> 49:53.190
then he has our permission to
burn to destroy all their goods

49:53.556 --> 49:57.560
and make a fearful example of
them to all of our subjects

50:00.086 --> 50:01.536
Yes, Majesty.

50:06.596 --> 50:09.581
If still they do not submit,
Mr. Cromwell,

50:09.706 --> 50:12.691
then I promise the utter
destruction of them
