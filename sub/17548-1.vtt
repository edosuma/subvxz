00:25.158 --> 00:26.125
<i>What are you doing down here?</i>

00:26.126 --> 00:27.969
<i>Alone?</i>

00:29.129 --> 00:30.665
<i>Thinking.</i>

00:32.499 --> 00:33.341
<i>About what?</i>

00:37.604 --> 00:39.438
<i>That I waited a long time.</i>

00:39.439 --> 00:41.146
<i>Long time?</i>

00:42.709 --> 00:46.122
<i>It's going to be 25 tomorrow.</i>

00:47.680 --> 00:51.750
<i>I'm afraid he's very dependent.</i>

00:51.751 --> 00:53.992
<i>Very acclimatized.</i>

00:54.721 --> 00:56.758
<i>I do not know if he could.</i>

00:59.059 --> 01:01.527
<i>I made him weak.</i>

01:01.528 --> 01:02.694
<i>This was the piano</i>

01:02.695 --> 01:04.572
<i>from the beginning.</i>

01:04.631 --> 01:07.633
<i>We can not just
quit our job now.</i>

01:07.634 --> 01:11.670
<i>It all depends on what
happens next, everything.</i>

01:11.671 --> 01:15.050
<i>We are so close to
finding the answer.</i>

01:16.176 --> 01:17.985
<i>I do not know if he's ready.</i>

01:19.712 --> 01:21.714
<i>I'm not sure I'm ready.</i>

01:23.049 --> 01:26.485
<i>Listen to me, I'll take care of him.</i>

01:26.486 --> 01:30.089
<i>I'll see you, you have my word.</i>

01:30.090 --> 01:33.230
<i>It's time for you to let go.</i>

01:35.662 --> 01:38.165
<i>Trust me, he's ready.</i>

01:48.557 --> 01:53.032
UNDERGROUND

02:28.948 --> 02:30.120
<i>Are you awake?</i>

03:52.232 --> 03:54.166
<i>Who is he?</i>

03:54.167 --> 03:55.703
<i>I do not know.</i>

05:00.566 --> 05:01.977
Hello.

05:10.209 --> 05:11.620
Who are you?

05:13.046 --> 05:14.218
Maya.

05:17.050 --> 05:18.154
Maya.

05:20.253 --> 05:22.054
Where I am?

05:22.055 --> 05:26.060
You first, I want
a direct answer.

05:30.963 --> 05:32.169
Who are you?

05:35.101 --> 05:37.012
You would not believe
me if I told you.

05:40.640 --> 05:42.119
Try telling me.

05:47.313 --> 05:49.350
<i>All I remember is darkness.</i>

05:55.021 --> 05:56.227
<i>What do you mean?</i>

05:58.124 --> 06:00.001
<i>There was a small saxophone.</i>

06:01.394 --> 06:02.998
<i>I was alone.</i>

06:05.965 --> 06:07.265
<i>It was all she had.</i>

06:07.266 --> 06:08.609
<i>Is this?</i>

06:11.137 --> 06:14.607
<i>No, no, there was a light.</i>

06:15.742 --> 06:18.310
<i>A voice taught me to speak and read.</i>

06:18.311 --> 06:20.086
<i>One voice?</i>

06:21.214 --> 06:23.057
<i>A provider.</i>

06:24.083 --> 06:26.118
- A.
- A.

06:26.119 --> 06:29.020
- B.
- B.

06:29.021 --> 06:32.023
- W.
- W.

06:32.024 --> 06:37.024
<i>And he took him to a
cave beneath the earth.</i>

06:38.765 --> 06:42.100
<i>He saw how thousands</i>

06:42.101 --> 06:45.737
<i>and thousands of
candles were burning</i>

06:45.738 --> 06:48.240
<i>on many nails.</i>

06:48.241 --> 06:51.042
<i>He saw how thousands and</i>

06:51.043 --> 06:54.146
<i>thousands of candles
were burning</i>

06:54.147 --> 06:56.093
<i>on many nails.</i>

06:57.083 --> 06:59.120
<i>So how did you get out?</i>

07:00.253 --> 07:05.293
<i>I do not know, I woke up in chaos.</i>

07:07.026 --> 07:09.694
<i>The light, the sound.</i>

07:09.695 --> 07:11.174
<i>He dominated me.</i>

07:14.066 --> 07:15.909
<i>I did not know what to do.</i>

07:16.702 --> 07:18.306
<i>I did not know where to go.</i>

07:22.074 --> 07:23.382
<i>I was afraid.</i>

07:26.345 --> 07:28.947
<i>Until Remy found me.</i>

07:28.948 --> 07:30.048
<i>Remy?</i>

07:30.049 --> 07:34.020
Hey, hey, what can I do for you?

07:34.720 --> 07:36.199
Panic?

07:37.223 --> 07:39.090
Come here.

07:39.091 --> 07:40.934
You're freezing to death.

07:42.094 --> 07:43.505
Are you okay?

07:47.033 --> 07:48.137
Are you okay?

07:49.469 --> 07:51.169
Yes, you're fine.

07:51.170 --> 07:52.337
Come on, you better get out of here.

07:52.338 --> 07:55.285
Before she calls the
police, she's scared.

07:58.211 --> 08:01.012
Hey, do you speak English or what?

08:01.013 --> 08:01.780
Did you break a leg?

08:01.781 --> 08:03.160
C'mon C'mon.

08:04.150 --> 08:05.891
English, let's go.

08:07.019 --> 08:09.120
<i>He was the first person I met.</i>

08:09.121 --> 08:11.022
<i>He took care of me.</i>

08:11.023 --> 08:12.991
<i>He taught me.</i>

08:12.992 --> 08:17.236
<i>I told him about my life,
about the darkness.</i>

08:18.297 --> 08:20.106
<i>I said it all.</i>

08:21.167 --> 08:22.441
What the fuck.

08:24.337 --> 08:27.113
This must have been in some
prison of rich people.

08:29.275 --> 08:30.442
What is it?

08:30.443 --> 08:32.150
Chic Prison.

08:33.179 --> 08:35.280
You must have pulled some work.

08:35.280 --> 08:38.216
What did you do, huh?

08:38.217 --> 08:40.184
Anything.

08:40.186 --> 08:42.320
Do you want me to believe that?

08:42.321 --> 08:45.495
You some kind of shit
about Rip Van Winkle?

08:50.196 --> 08:52.369
What the hell is Rip Van Winkle?

09:00.907 --> 09:02.250
You're okay.

09:05.311 --> 09:08.258
A little strange,
but you're okay.

09:10.349 --> 09:12.124
What the fuck is Rip Van Winkle.

09:18.291 --> 09:19.895
<i>It's a story.</i>

09:24.096 --> 09:27.198
It's about a man who falls
asleep for a long time

09:27.199 --> 09:29.338
and wakes up in a new world.

09:33.306 --> 09:35.013
I understood.

09:38.511 --> 09:40.184
I need to find him.

09:41.213 --> 09:42.521
Who?

09:43.616 --> 09:47.052
<i>The provider, he's the only one</i>

09:47.053 --> 09:48.555
<i>Who knows who I am.</i>

09:50.623 --> 09:52.398
<i>Maybe I can help.</i>

09:56.162 --> 09:58.039
How can I trust you?

10:47.713 --> 10:49.249
<i>Fire.</i>

11:05.197 --> 11:07.399
<i>LESSON NUMBER ONE, THERE
IS ONLY ONE PERSON</i>

11:07.400 --> 11:09.267
<i>What can you tell in this life?</i>

11:09.268 --> 11:11.111
and that is yourself.

11:11.170 --> 11:15.273
You have to go back,
do not trust anyone,

11:15.274 --> 11:18.109
No one, because they
always let you down.

11:18.110 --> 11:19.477
Heard?

11:19.478 --> 11:20.512
Yes.

11:20.513 --> 11:24.215
All right, you go ahead.

11:24.216 --> 11:26.117
Hey Hey.

11:26.118 --> 11:27.051
What do you want?

11:27.052 --> 11:29.287
What do we want?

11:29.288 --> 11:32.390
We would like two cookies.

11:32.391 --> 11:34.701
Okay, anything else?

11:35.628 --> 11:37.162
Yes.

11:37.163 --> 11:39.731
How are you doing today, okay?

11:39.732 --> 11:41.166
Yeah, it's okay.

11:41.167 --> 11:42.467
Pretty earrings, I like it.

11:42.468 --> 11:44.448
Thanks, coffee?

11:45.538 --> 11:47.439
Two coffee.

11:47.440 --> 11:48.373
Despicable.

11:48.374 --> 11:49.708
That's it, huh?

11:49.709 --> 11:52.477
No respect in
service these days.

11:52.478 --> 11:53.478
Listen.

11:53.479 --> 11:55.714
LESSON NUMBER TWO.

11:55.715 --> 11:57.515
Take whatever you want.

11:57.516 --> 11:59.784
If you see it, it takes.

11:59.785 --> 12:01.553
See and catch.

12:01.554 --> 12:03.192
Yes.

12:05.424 --> 12:07.392
- The money.
- What?

12:07.393 --> 12:08.599
Take it.

12:13.399 --> 12:15.675
That's what I'm talking about.

12:18.337 --> 12:19.577
Is the coffee ready?

12:22.742 --> 12:23.743
<i>Your results are empty.</i>

12:23.943 --> 12:25.410
<i>I've already seen it.</i>

12:25.411 --> 12:28.346
<i>There are no records of anything.</i>

12:28.347 --> 12:30.190
<i>What do you mean?</i>

12:31.383 --> 12:34.489
<i>It means that on the
computer, it does not exist.</i>

12:35.621 --> 12:37.388
<i>Anything?</i>

12:37.389 --> 12:40.592
<i>There are no medical
or dental records,</i>

12:40.593 --> 12:43.428
<i>no birth certificate,
digital prints,</i>

12:43.429 --> 12:45.430
<i>social security, nothing.</i>

12:45.431 --> 12:47.499
<i>It's almost as if
someone had deleted it.</i>

12:47.500 --> 12:49.411
<i>of the face of the Earth.</i>

12:50.503 --> 12:52.540
Either that or...

12:53.506 --> 12:55.473
Or what?

12:55.474 --> 12:57.511
Or he never had anything.

12:58.611 --> 13:01.455
But everyone has records,
at least something.

13:02.414 --> 13:04.582
I found the name of
the man and him.

13:04.583 --> 13:06.584
She took blood at the same time

13:06.585 --> 13:08.386
that he was born.

13:08.387 --> 13:10.628
Her last address is there.

13:12.525 --> 13:16.261
Look, I did what I promised.

13:16.262 --> 13:20.465
I'm done, you
should do the same.

13:20.466 --> 13:25.403
He's a problem, Maya, I
do not care what you see.

13:25.404 --> 13:28.180
I need to know who he is.

13:29.708 --> 13:31.210
Maya.

13:32.278 --> 13:34.679
I love you, but this is crazy.

13:34.680 --> 13:38.526
You do not know who he is,
what he is capable of.

13:41.420 --> 13:44.560
<i>Take it and shoot it, go, do it!</i>

13:44.623 --> 13:45.601
<i>Shoot the idiot!</i>

13:53.032 --> 13:55.567
I will not let you do this,
I'll call the police.

13:55.568 --> 13:57.602
Do not stop.

13:57.603 --> 13:59.571
What if he can give
me some answers?

13:59.572 --> 14:01.506
You already know you can
go if you want answers.

14:01.507 --> 14:04.488
No, I want the truth,
there are more lies.

14:13.419 --> 14:17.196
Look, just give me some time.

14:18.357 --> 14:19.358
If I do not find anything,

14:19.425 --> 14:21.371
I'll call myself.

14:29.468 --> 14:31.277
Promise me that you will.

14:46.318 --> 14:48.320
What did she mean
I did not exist?

14:50.089 --> 14:51.932
What did she mean by that?

14:56.595 --> 14:58.575
You should not hear that.

15:05.337 --> 15:07.442
Let's start looking in the morning.

15:10.509 --> 15:13.544
<i>To exist means to be</i>

15:13.545 --> 15:15.582
<i>or have life.</i>

15:18.384 --> 15:21.558
<i>Immortal souls will
never cease to exist.</i>

15:57.623 --> 16:01.400
<i>That's all for today,
now, go to sleep.</i>

16:03.262 --> 16:07.404
<i>Are you in or am I?</i>

17:01.553 --> 17:04.021
Well that's.

17:04.022 --> 17:06.594
Your man's last known address.

17:08.926 --> 17:10.428
Is she?

17:10.429 --> 17:13.433
Why do not you let
me check first?

17:57.109 --> 17:58.952
Where is she?

18:00.479 --> 18:01.958
She's down there.

18:05.951 --> 18:07.862
What is she doing down there?

18:12.658 --> 18:14.001
She's dead.

18:15.494 --> 18:17.030
She's buried here.

18:19.098 --> 18:20.372
Oh.

18:26.705 --> 18:29.083
I've never really
had one, either.

18:31.143 --> 18:36.149
I remember things about
her, but nothing concrete,

18:36.648 --> 18:38.389
nothing real.

18:41.019 --> 18:43.688
I suppose that makes us the same.

18:43.689 --> 18:45.168
As?

18:47.626 --> 18:49.196
We are not rfs.

18:52.231 --> 18:55.440
But I had a kind of father.

18:57.136 --> 18:59.537
Where is he?

18:59.538 --> 19:02.075
<i>I do not know, I have not
seen it for some time</i>

19:04.143 --> 19:05.588
Do not you want it?

19:17.289 --> 19:19.098
IN MEMORY OF TILLY GLADDIS
05/24/60 - 06/02/92

19:19.258 --> 19:21.135
C'mon C'mon.

20:44.776 --> 20:46.050
Who is she?

20:48.313 --> 20:49.690
It's me.

20:51.783 --> 20:53.784
What do you mean?

20:53.785 --> 20:56.254
I mean, it was taken
when I was a kid.

20:56.255 --> 20:58.201
It's been a long time.

21:00.559 --> 21:02.059
Are you?

21:02.060 --> 21:03.661
Yes.

21:03.662 --> 21:05.938
It's kind of hard to see
the resemblance, eh?

21:08.634 --> 21:11.012
I think I've always
liked flowers.

21:11.970 --> 21:13.677
At least as long as I remember.

21:42.134 --> 21:43.306
With what seems?

21:46.238 --> 21:47.683
<i>What?</i>

21:51.977 --> 21:54.048
<i>I've never seen this before.</i>

21:59.017 --> 22:00.655
<i>At first I was...</i>

22:03.055 --> 22:04.363
<i>riled up.</i>

22:08.093 --> 22:10.039
<i>Then I was ashamed.</i>

22:13.265 --> 22:16.133
<i>I had never seen</i>

22:16.134 --> 22:18.614
<i>a star like that tonight.</i>

22:21.039 --> 22:23.645
<i>I read the word
hundreds of times.</i>

22:25.110 --> 22:28.412
<i>A fixed spot in the night sky,</i>

22:28.413 --> 22:32.416
<i>which is a large, remote,
incandescent body</i>

22:32.417 --> 22:34.055
<i>as he was.</i>

22:35.153 --> 22:36.632
<i>I just...</i>

22:39.024 --> 22:41.334
<i>I did not know it would be so beautiful.</i>

22:45.430 --> 22:47.171
<i>That's nice.</i>

22:59.077 --> 23:00.945
<i>Are you sure he's asleep?</i>

23:00.946 --> 23:04.120
Yes, we just put it there
it's been a long time.

23:05.384 --> 23:07.051
<i>Listen.</i>

23:07.052 --> 23:09.053
<i>I want to take it.</i>

23:09.054 --> 23:10.654
<i>To pull</i>

23:10.655 --> 23:12.456
<i>We can not go on with
this, it's not right,</i>

23:12.457 --> 23:14.091
<i>is not human.</i>

23:14.092 --> 23:16.093
<i>I do not think we can do that.</i>

23:16.094 --> 23:17.461
<i>You trust me, do not you?</i>

23:17.462 --> 23:19.063
<i>Of course I trust you.</i>

23:19.064 --> 23:21.135
<i>So let's end this madness.</i>

23:23.101 --> 23:26.103
Can you give me some change?

23:26.104 --> 23:28.038
Dude, do you have
any money left?

23:28.039 --> 23:30.741
Come on, I'm hungry.

23:30.742 --> 23:32.483
Hey, you got nothing?

23:34.045 --> 23:36.184
Do you have any coins left?

23:38.116 --> 23:38.949
I am just trying to get home,

23:38.950 --> 23:41.085
I have to catch the bus.

23:41.086 --> 23:42.253
Get yourself a job, man.

23:42.254 --> 23:44.255
Son of a bitch.

23:44.256 --> 23:46.964
Wait until you need something.

23:50.295 --> 23:52.434
Wait until you need some money.

23:54.366 --> 23:56.267
Do you have a spare room?

23:56.268 --> 23:57.975
Kitty.

23:58.036 --> 24:00.104
Hey Girl!

24:00.105 --> 24:02.139
Girl!

24:02.140 --> 24:04.141
Female dog.

24:04.142 --> 24:06.076
Dude, do you have any money?

24:06.077 --> 24:09.480
I'm just trying something
to eat, I'm hungry.

24:09.481 --> 24:11.324
Come on, you got something.

24:13.218 --> 24:17.223
Okay, thank you, God
bless you, man.

24:20.158 --> 24:21.398
It is so it does.

24:23.261 --> 24:25.104
This is how you
get these people.

24:49.187 --> 24:50.257
How was it out there?

24:53.558 --> 24:56.026
All right, it's a start.

24:56.027 --> 25:00.169
It's a start, all right,
good work, let's go.

25:27.192 --> 25:28.899
Perverted.

25:30.428 --> 25:32.463
There's a way to get someone.

25:32.464 --> 25:34.501
We will have to work this out.

25:43.074 --> 25:44.451
Now you are learning.

25:45.577 --> 25:47.215
This is my boy.

25:51.283 --> 25:52.523
Let's go.

25:55.587 --> 25:58.188
It gives me.

25:58.189 --> 25:59.429
That's right.

26:01.459 --> 26:04.303
I have a bigger job for you.

26:05.130 --> 26:06.497
This is small.

26:06.498 --> 26:08.566
<i>Assault that occurred last week
in the center of the city.</i>

26:08.567 --> 26:12.071
<i>Police showed this
photo of the suspect</i>

26:12.137 --> 26:15.306
<i>from an anonymous source.</i>

26:15.307 --> 26:19.176
<i>The victim Manuela Bloc is
still in critical condition.</i>

26:19.177 --> 26:21.345
<i>The police are asking that
anyone with information</i>

26:21.346 --> 26:23.314
<i>contact.</i>

26:23.315 --> 26:26.216
<i>Talking about the
recent rise in violence</i>

26:26.217 --> 26:28.552
<i>Dr Peter Mockenrue,
is now with us to</i>

26:28.553 --> 26:30.254
<i>speak some things.</i>

26:30.255 --> 26:32.423
<i>somo pre-conditioned
for these types,</i>

26:32.424 --> 26:36.026
<i>of senseless acts, it
is always shocking when</i>

26:36.027 --> 26:38.362
<i>in our community and
touches us personally.</i>

26:38.363 --> 26:40.097
It's him.

26:40.098 --> 26:42.266
<i>I think we can all agree
that it's very sad.</i>

26:42.267 --> 26:45.271
<i>The violence continues to be...</i>

26:46.438 --> 26:49.273
<i>I can not tell you
what you do not know.</i>

26:49.274 --> 26:53.245
<i>I give the direction to
those who can not See.</i>

27:00.318 --> 27:02.491
<i>And the provider, he's here.</i>

27:04.356 --> 27:06.023
This is the voice.

27:06.024 --> 27:08.225
Stop it, stop it.

27:08.226 --> 27:09.460
My provider is here.

27:09.461 --> 27:11.566
Hey, hey, hang your head.

27:13.565 --> 27:16.512
You know that guy, huh?

27:17.435 --> 27:19.244
I do not...

27:20.305 --> 27:21.405
I think we're being followed.

27:21.406 --> 27:23.113
Right.

27:24.643 --> 27:27.351
Yeah, get that.

27:29.481 --> 27:32.583
We just have to go
unnoticed for a while.

27:32.584 --> 27:34.222
Put that on.

27:37.455 --> 27:42.370
<i>Remy thought he was a cop,
he was always watching.</i>

27:46.665 --> 27:49.077
<i>So Remy thought of a piano.</i>

27:49.634 --> 27:51.238
<i>He took it.</i>

27:54.339 --> 27:56.046
<i>Paul Grant.</i>

27:58.143 --> 28:00.316
<i>What if he was not following Remy?</i>

28:02.047 --> 28:03.355
<i>What do you mean?</i>

28:04.516 --> 28:06.325
<i>Maybe he can help.</i>

28:14.392 --> 28:16.394
Act naturally.

28:25.503 --> 28:27.278
Act naturally.

28:30.275 --> 28:31.618
I can help you?

28:33.344 --> 28:35.412
We're just wondering
if you're satisfied.

28:35.413 --> 28:39.327
with your Internet connection, Mrs.
Grant.

28:40.452 --> 28:42.489
My name is not Grant.

28:43.588 --> 28:46.323
We must have the wrong information.

28:46.324 --> 28:48.395
Sorry for the
inconvenience, Miss.

28:52.530 --> 28:53.731
What are you doing?

28:53.732 --> 28:57.475
Be quiet, I'm trying to
find out who she is.

29:12.350 --> 29:15.552
The address is correct, but,

29:15.553 --> 29:18.500
but there is nothing
about Paul Grant.

30:08.973 --> 30:10.350
<i>Come on, Lucas.</i>

30:17.415 --> 30:19.224
<i>I am a doctor.</i>

30:20.451 --> 30:22.362
<i>Let's clean it up then.</i>

30:49.247 --> 30:50.624
Can I help you?

30:53.585 --> 30:55.586
I'm looking for someone.

30:55.587 --> 30:59.057
I see, well you've come
to the right place.

31:03.561 --> 31:06.303
Just let me know if I can
help you with anything.

31:33.758 --> 31:35.425
What are you doing?

31:35.426 --> 31:37.794
What place is this?

31:37.795 --> 31:39.502
It's a church.

31:41.499 --> 31:43.501
And who is he?

31:45.503 --> 31:46.982
Jesus.

31:48.506 --> 31:49.576
Jesus.

31:51.409 --> 31:52.717
What's wrong with him?

31:55.580 --> 31:58.390
I'll tell you later,
we have to go.

32:01.052 --> 32:03.553
Come on, come on, come on.

32:03.554 --> 32:04.897
Come down here.

32:09.494 --> 32:10.632
Go.

32:35.520 --> 32:37.557
Stay here, I'll come back.

32:39.524 --> 32:41.525
Hey, where are you going?

32:41.526 --> 32:42.732
Hey!

32:50.001 --> 32:51.468
He's here.

32:51.469 --> 32:52.971
I'm sure he has not seen you,

32:53.037 --> 32:56.039
I'm going up to make
sure he's gone, right?

32:56.040 --> 32:58.375
This is getting serious.

32:58.376 --> 33:00.711
He is being pursued
by the police.

33:00.712 --> 33:02.579
People are dead.

33:02.580 --> 33:05.649
When was the last time you had
a gun in your face, Lucas?

33:05.650 --> 33:07.551
We just need to end it
and it needs to be now.

33:07.552 --> 33:08.986
We can not.

33:08.987 --> 33:10.721
Pedro said that under
no circumstances

33:10.722 --> 33:12.022
we must interfere.

33:12.023 --> 33:13.696
He has already seen my face.

33:13.758 --> 33:15.425
We just need to go unnoticed.

33:15.426 --> 33:16.593
We have not interfered enough.

33:16.594 --> 33:20.940
<i>Come on, Lucas, get up.</i>

33:22.967 --> 33:27.712
If we do not end this now,
someone's going to die.

33:29.040 --> 33:31.008
No one is going to die.

33:31.009 --> 33:32.579
How do you know that?

33:34.145 --> 33:35.715
He's not Maya.

33:38.516 --> 33:39.750
Maya.

33:39.751 --> 33:42.085
Yes, I do not know
how he found it,

33:42.086 --> 33:45.422
but she is clinging to him now.

33:45.423 --> 33:48.768
I could not tell Sarah, I'm
sure you'll understand.

33:50.461 --> 33:52.099
But I'll tell Peter.

33:53.464 --> 33:57.167
No, let's relax and stay calm.

33:57.168 --> 33:58.635
I'm calm.

33:58.636 --> 34:00.081
The only thing we're
going to tell Peter is

34:00.138 --> 34:02.572
is that everything is
going according to plan.

34:02.573 --> 34:04.075
You are not
receiving for this.

34:06.411 --> 34:08.045
Go outside.

34:08.045 --> 34:09.684
I hope it's the boy.

34:13.184 --> 34:14.985
Christ.

34:14.985 --> 34:17.556
Can you just tell
me what's going on?

34:21.726 --> 34:23.364
Talk to me.

34:24.629 --> 34:25.937
I do not know.

34:27.598 --> 34:29.966
The name of the priest is Lucas Dietrich.

34:29.967 --> 34:33.703
He started the fail-safe
system in the church,

34:33.704 --> 34:35.205
whatever it may be.

34:35.206 --> 34:39.708
I've seen them both before.

34:39.710 --> 34:42.088
They were carrying me somewhere.

34:43.714 --> 34:45.694
This seems recent.

34:45.750 --> 34:47.092
Do not touch.

34:51.089 --> 34:52.534
Excuse me.

34:54.725 --> 34:56.670
I'm just trying to help.

35:02.667 --> 35:04.374
How do they know you?

35:06.104 --> 35:08.138
What?

35:08.139 --> 35:10.207
Those men, they
mentioned his name,

35:10.208 --> 35:11.653
How do they know you?

35:13.611 --> 35:15.386
Did they mention my name?

35:23.521 --> 35:24.693
I do not know.

35:31.062 --> 35:32.700
Believe me.

35:42.006 --> 35:43.246
Right.

36:35.560 --> 36:37.733
I come here when
I want to think.

36:39.063 --> 36:42.065
It is strange, however, that there
is something in this place.

36:42.066 --> 36:44.103
which haunts me.

36:46.103 --> 36:50.006
<i>I dream I'm here,
finding something.</i>

36:50.007 --> 36:54.544
<i>I see these images in my mind,</i>

36:54.545 --> 36:58.049
<i>they look so real.</i>

36:58.950 --> 37:01.952
<i>I come here when I
wake up and watch</i>

37:01.953 --> 37:04.991
<i>but every time I do,
I feel further away.</i>

37:06.524 --> 37:08.003
But I keep coming back.

37:08.926 --> 37:12.032
I always come back.

37:12.096 --> 37:13.666
Because?

37:15.266 --> 37:16.233
It's not so easy.

37:16.234 --> 37:18.942
Forget your past, you know?

37:23.941 --> 37:25.614
At least you have one.

37:29.680 --> 37:31.318
Something to remember.

37:35.219 --> 37:36.596
Anything.

37:43.261 --> 37:44.706
Excuse me.

37:52.336 --> 37:56.216
Maya, how did you find me?

37:59.343 --> 38:01.144
I said, I got your money, man.

38:01.145 --> 38:03.980
I was there.

38:03.981 --> 38:05.289
I was putting the
garbage out at work

38:05.349 --> 38:08.084
when I heard the fight in the alley.

38:08.085 --> 38:09.530
Shit.

38:12.657 --> 38:13.590
Take the.

38:13.591 --> 38:15.025
I saw what happened.

38:15.026 --> 38:18.028
Shoot him, go, shoot the idiot!

38:18.029 --> 38:19.129
I saw what he did to you.

38:19.130 --> 38:20.541
Do it.

38:21.966 --> 38:23.604
<i>I could not do that.</i>

38:24.368 --> 38:25.735
I know.

38:25.736 --> 38:28.148
<i>Are you afraid of getting
your hands dirty?</i>

38:29.573 --> 38:31.052
Let's go!

38:32.376 --> 38:34.287
Shit.

38:34.345 --> 38:35.983
You want to fuck with me?

39:12.350 --> 39:13.683
Do not.

39:13.684 --> 39:16.619
What do you mean, no?

39:16.620 --> 39:18.288
That's not how it works here.

39:18.289 --> 39:21.391
You're the murderer, you know?

39:21.392 --> 39:23.960
We did not kill those guys.

39:23.961 --> 39:25.028
I do not.

39:25.029 --> 39:27.297
Who can say that they did not do it?

39:27.298 --> 39:29.642
You're a ghost, right?

39:31.736 --> 39:34.148
You are free to walk.
boy

39:35.973 --> 39:38.385
I do not want your help any more.

39:42.012 --> 39:43.346
Right?

39:43.347 --> 39:45.048
Sorry for the boy.

39:45.049 --> 39:47.154
Better luck next time.

39:54.191 --> 39:56.694
No amount of money
is worth that shit.

39:59.697 --> 40:02.268
<i>He hit you and left you to die.</i>

40:04.068 --> 40:06.336
<i>I could not just
leave you out there,</i>

40:06.337 --> 40:09.139
<i>So I brought you to my house.</i>

40:09.140 --> 40:11.341
<i>Despite what everyone told me,</i>

40:11.342 --> 40:13.652
<i>or what the news said.</i>

40:17.181 --> 40:18.717
<i>There is no one here.</i>

40:20.084 --> 40:21.961
<i>It's you and me.</i>

40:26.323 --> 40:28.024
<i>Bluebell.</i>

40:28.025 --> 40:30.293
<i>You owe me one.</i>

40:30.294 --> 40:32.069
<i>Because?</i>

40:35.433 --> 40:37.242
I saved you.

40:53.984 --> 40:55.118
I want to show you
somewhere else.

40:55.119 --> 40:57.156
I think you will like it.

41:44.301 --> 41:45.974
Has much.

41:50.541 --> 41:52.350
Much what?

41:54.111 --> 41:55.351
All.

41:58.148 --> 42:00.992
I spent all this time
there and had no idea.

42:05.356 --> 42:07.233
I just feel I'm asking.

42:08.359 --> 42:10.927
You are not.

42:10.928 --> 42:12.373
Believe me.

42:14.131 --> 42:16.202
You're brighter than most.

42:21.539 --> 42:24.274
Why are you doing this?

42:24.275 --> 42:25.982
Doing what?

42:27.177 --> 42:28.485
Helping me.

42:30.414 --> 42:32.189
I do not know.

42:34.518 --> 42:36.964
You may think I'm crazy, but...

42:40.324 --> 42:42.099
I know your eyes.

42:46.096 --> 42:47.473
I've seen them before.

42:57.374 --> 42:59.285
I do not think you're crazy.

43:23.267 --> 43:24.974
Just chill.

46:11.101 --> 46:12.375
I love you.

46:28.418 --> 46:30.364
How do you know bluebell?

46:31.488 --> 46:32.694
What?

46:34.625 --> 46:37.426
I heard you speaking in your dream.

46:37.427 --> 46:39.907
You kept repeating
the word bluebell.

46:42.533 --> 46:43.637
Oh.

46:44.968 --> 46:46.538
I do not know.

46:48.005 --> 46:49.507
It is a flower.

46:53.477 --> 46:55.511
<i>Who is this?</i>

46:55.512 --> 46:56.746
<i>It's me, difficult to see</i>

46:56.747 --> 46:58.590
<i>the resemblance, eh?</i>

47:43.594 --> 47:45.005
Maya?

47:46.230 --> 47:47.402
Hello?

47:48.732 --> 47:49.938
Maya?

48:05.249 --> 48:06.455
<i>N?</i>

48:08.385 --> 48:09.518
<i>Are you there?</i>

48:09.519 --> 48:10.964
Hello?

48:12.256 --> 48:14.497
<i>You need to leave now.</i>

48:16.026 --> 48:17.360
Who is it?

48:17.361 --> 48:18.527
<i>There is no time for this.</i>

48:18.528 --> 48:20.563
<i>He's coming for you.</i>

48:20.564 --> 48:22.331
<i>You have to go.</i>

48:22.332 --> 48:23.532
What?

48:23.533 --> 48:25.334
<i>What are you waiting for?</i>

48:25.335 --> 48:26.535
I'm trying to find Maya.

48:26.536 --> 48:27.603
<i>If you want answers,</i>

48:27.604 --> 48:29.982
<i>meet me on the cross street</i>

48:39.483 --> 48:40.928
<i>Maya.</i>

48:42.552 --> 48:44.361
<i>Maya!</i>

49:32.302 --> 49:33.502
How can I help you?

49:33.503 --> 49:34.570
Just a coffee with decaf milk.

49:34.571 --> 49:35.982
Nice.

49:41.611 --> 49:42.445
Here it is.

49:42.446 --> 49:43.312
How much do I owe you?

49:43.313 --> 49:44.447
Is 3.85.

49:44.448 --> 49:45.620
Here it is.

49:48.986 --> 49:50.897
- Here it is.
- Thank you.

49:53.590 --> 49:55.365
Hey.

49:59.596 --> 50:00.629
What do you think you're doing?

50:00.630 --> 50:02.631
Hey, hey, man, let's go.

50:02.632 --> 50:04.533
Let's go, please, let's go.

50:04.534 --> 50:05.468
Give me your hands.

50:05.469 --> 50:07.136
No, no.

50:07.137 --> 50:08.671
Put your hands behind
your back now.

50:08.672 --> 50:09.739
Maya!

50:09.740 --> 50:10.973
Stop resisting, give me the hands,

50:10.974 --> 50:12.578
now.

50:14.411 --> 50:16.482
Give me your hand.

50:17.948 --> 50:19.482
<i>It's branches to leave together.</i>

50:19.483 --> 50:21.751
<i>and now she's gone,
can you help me?</i>

50:21.752 --> 50:23.586
<i>Turn to your right.</i>

50:23.587 --> 50:25.087
<i>What, where?</i>

50:25.088 --> 50:26.158
<i>I told you to turn around.</i>

50:28.692 --> 50:30.501
<i>Facing.</i>

50:35.665 --> 50:37.076
Where I am?

50:38.201 --> 50:39.612
Home.

50:42.506 --> 50:44.076
<i>Now go to sleep.</i>

50:55.986 --> 50:58.454
<i>Damn it.</i>

50:58.455 --> 50:59.991
<i>Excuse me.</i>

51:00.724 --> 51:05.002
Hey, it was an accident.

51:06.530 --> 51:10.945
I do not have control, you know?

51:22.045 --> 51:23.679
Come on, we have to get out of here!

51:23.680 --> 51:27.059
Get up, I said,
let's go, let's go.

51:28.585 --> 51:30.531
<i>He's watching you.</i>

51:34.958 --> 51:37.529
<i>Your eyes are everywhere.</i>

51:40.664 --> 51:42.498
Hello?

51:42.499 --> 51:44.800
<i>You can not escape it.</i>

51:44.801 --> 51:47.670
<i>You can not hide in the light.</i>

51:47.671 --> 51:51.807
<i>There is no where to hide.</i>

51:51.808 --> 51:53.617
Hello?

52:01.418 --> 52:02.920
Provider?

52:03.920 --> 52:05.695
<i>No, we're not.</i>

52:07.691 --> 52:10.194
<i>We're all stuck here.</i>

52:12.996 --> 52:15.636
<i>We never left.</i>

52:17.501 --> 52:19.947
Raise!

52:23.507 --> 52:27.011
Your bail was paid,
you're free to go.

52:30.714 --> 52:33.149
Do you want to leave or not?

52:33.150 --> 52:34.686
Get up.

52:39.656 --> 52:41.966
Here, he gave you that.

53:28.672 --> 53:30.015
Hello?

53:34.711 --> 53:35.689
This way.

53:40.083 --> 53:41.584
Who are you?

53:41.585 --> 53:44.725
My name is Andrew, come in.

53:46.957 --> 53:47.756
Let's go.

53:47.757 --> 53:49.600
I will not bite you.

54:08.178 --> 54:09.555
Right.

54:12.315 --> 54:13.953
Going down.

54:50.020 --> 54:54.025
Welcome to my extremely
humble home.

55:01.931 --> 55:06.335
Sorry for the mess,
the maid is off duty.

55:06.336 --> 55:07.906
Do you think I
should let her go?

55:22.118 --> 55:25.099
Ah, there it is.

55:27.023 --> 55:28.627
It's cute.

55:29.926 --> 55:31.132
The mark.

55:33.129 --> 55:35.130
Excuse.

55:35.131 --> 55:38.010
I forgot how nervous
I was at first.

55:45.141 --> 55:46.142
Hey.

55:47.243 --> 55:48.984
Let's Chill.

55:55.385 --> 55:56.752
What do you want from me?

55:56.753 --> 55:59.063
I want to help you.

56:00.023 --> 56:02.936
I want to help us.

56:06.896 --> 56:08.603
Come here and look at this.

56:10.133 --> 56:13.080
Come on, I will not hurt you.

56:19.142 --> 56:21.122
It looks familiar, huh?

56:22.045 --> 56:23.251
Ah.

56:25.181 --> 56:27.092
You saw it now.

56:28.084 --> 56:29.427
Who are you?

56:30.687 --> 56:32.325
I'm your brother.

56:38.161 --> 56:42.109
<i>I escaped a long time from the
same fate that you suffered.</i>

56:43.266 --> 56:47.009
I've spent my whole life
looking for answers.

56:49.172 --> 56:53.746
Everything, all of this, is a collection

56:53.943 --> 56:57.713
of evidence and clues.

56:57.714 --> 57:00.215
He escaped all this time.

57:00.216 --> 57:03.129
But now you've come.

57:04.988 --> 57:09.057
We can not find it
now and make it pay.

57:09.058 --> 57:10.196
Who?

57:11.361 --> 57:13.170
The provider.

57:16.166 --> 57:18.077
How can I trust you?

57:19.302 --> 57:24.139
He gripped it so tightly
with his icy hand.

57:24.140 --> 57:28.444
that he could not
resist and took him

57:28.445 --> 57:32.154
in a cave beneath the earth.

57:33.183 --> 57:37.052
He saw how thousands
and thousands

57:37.053 --> 57:41.223
of candles were
burning in many rows.

57:41.224 --> 57:45.527
Some large, others
half the size,

57:45.528 --> 57:48.065
other small ones.

57:48.131 --> 57:52.100
Every moment, some
were extinguished

57:52.101 --> 57:55.137
and others burned again

57:55.138 --> 57:59.174
for the flames to rise,

57:59.175 --> 58:01.086
Here and there

58:01.144 --> 58:04.091
always changing.

58:07.450 --> 58:09.327
How do you know that?

58:11.154 --> 58:14.897
Because he read me the
same stories to sleep.

58:16.326 --> 58:20.274
The same lies and
mistakes he fed you.

58:23.333 --> 58:26.034
How did you find me?

58:26.035 --> 58:29.204
Quite easy, I've been following you.

58:29.205 --> 58:32.975
As you can see, I like
to observe things.

58:32.976 --> 58:36.044
I've paid attention to your
story in the newspaper.

58:36.045 --> 58:39.214
You've done a lot of
things in record time.

58:39.215 --> 58:41.984
Eventually the police would
have arrested you forever.

58:41.985 --> 58:44.192
if I had not rescued you.

58:45.188 --> 58:47.055
Are they still looking for me?

58:47.056 --> 58:49.002
Of course yes.

58:49.559 --> 58:52.327
So why did they let me go?

58:52.328 --> 58:55.400
Sometimes it costs to be a ghost.

58:56.599 --> 58:59.401
I just want to say it's
very difficult for someone

58:59.402 --> 59:01.470
blame someone

59:01.471 --> 59:05.920
no record, no history.

59:07.143 --> 59:10.412
This is the prize of your anonymity.

59:10.413 --> 59:13.148
He covered up his crimes enough.

59:13.149 --> 59:15.527
I took care of the rest.

59:17.020 --> 59:20.194
I'm the one to blame
you for something now,

59:21.224 --> 59:22.958
or maybe it.

59:22.959 --> 59:24.293
You know him.

59:24.294 --> 59:26.365
Paul Grant, of course.

59:26.429 --> 59:29.364
He followed me around the
for a while.

59:29.365 --> 59:33.201
I never got my hands on
him, you cowardly bastard.

59:33.202 --> 59:36.972
Then when he appeared
wherever he went,

59:36.973 --> 59:39.283
I just put two and two together.

59:43.513 --> 59:45.480
I've seen them before too.

59:45.481 --> 59:48.150
Ah, yes, Lucas.

59:48.151 --> 59:50.586
He is one of his servants.

59:50.587 --> 59:55.257
Praying for the innocent souls
once they are released.

59:55.258 --> 59:58.527
<i>Trying to control our
weak and atrophied minds</i>

59:58.528 --> 01:00:01.063
<i>from the outside.</i>

01:00:01.064 --> 01:00:04.566
You saw, you're not the only one.

01:00:04.567 --> 01:00:07.446
<i>We're not the only ones.</i>

01:00:08.571 --> 01:00:12.314
There are many of us
out there, just look.

01:00:13.276 --> 01:00:15.677
<i>Some have no recollection</i>

01:00:15.678 --> 01:00:18.213
<i>and you will not believe the truth.</i>

01:00:18.214 --> 01:00:21.249
<i>Others are very far away and
have lost consciousness</i>

01:00:21.250 --> 01:00:23.151
<i>and sanity.</i>

01:00:23.152 --> 01:00:27.328
You saw, we're all part
of your sick game.

01:00:28.291 --> 01:00:32.330
But together, we can
not get answers.

01:00:34.497 --> 01:00:36.170
Maya.

01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:40.677
Sorry, I saw what happened.

01:00:42.138 --> 01:00:44.573
What happened?

01:00:44.574 --> 01:00:46.349
He took her.

01:00:48.478 --> 01:00:50.379
Who?

01:00:50.380 --> 01:00:52.326
The provider.

01:00:53.549 --> 01:00:56.551
If you want to find
it, you will have

01:00:56.552 --> 01:00:58.623
that found it.

01:01:00.490 --> 01:01:02.367
To kill him.

01:01:04.360 --> 01:01:08.604
For all that he smote and bound,

01:01:09.699 --> 01:01:14.069
for every life he
said was sensuous

01:01:14.070 --> 01:01:16.448
to fly alone,

01:01:17.373 --> 01:01:21.576
You had everything
denied by you.

01:01:21.577 --> 01:01:24.421
and taken.

01:01:27.316 --> 01:01:29.557
Do not you want to know why?

01:01:31.421 --> 01:01:34.368
An end to all silence?

01:02:19.669 --> 01:02:22.377
Well, close the door.

01:02:25.742 --> 01:02:27.342
What are we looking for?

01:02:27.343 --> 01:02:29.345
Evidence.

01:02:30.346 --> 01:02:34.351
She's involved in this, we
just need to figure out how.

01:02:39.455 --> 01:02:41.594
Looks like she had some company.

01:02:42.458 --> 01:02:44.459
Take a look.

01:02:44.460 --> 01:02:46.133
I'll check it out.

01:03:21.397 --> 01:03:23.138
Hey, look at this.

01:03:25.201 --> 01:03:26.407
Well, time's up.

01:03:27.503 --> 01:03:29.337
I've seen it before.

01:03:29.338 --> 01:03:32.376
Well, get the picture,
it'll last longer.

01:03:40.216 --> 01:03:42.484
<i>Well, let's see, the
kitchen appears</i>

01:03:42.485 --> 01:03:45.489
<i>closed at night.</i>

01:03:47.456 --> 01:03:50.198
I do not think you
want any of this,

01:03:51.561 --> 01:03:53.268
But I want.

01:04:07.677 --> 01:04:11.318
Hey, look what l found.

01:04:31.968 --> 01:04:34.448
I need to get back to Maya.

01:04:34.503 --> 01:04:38.306
Okay, let's go.

01:04:38.307 --> 01:04:40.275
Do not.

01:04:40.276 --> 01:04:42.544
I need to be alone.

01:04:42.545 --> 01:04:43.922
Completely.

01:06:14.036 --> 01:06:15.538
Hello?

01:06:44.967 --> 01:06:49.438
<i>Bluebell, Bluebell.</i>

01:07:15.998 --> 01:07:17.636
I trust you.

01:07:21.971 --> 01:07:23.507
That's nice.

01:07:25.708 --> 01:07:27.381
Let's go out.

01:07:29.712 --> 01:07:31.658
And your answers?

01:07:33.716 --> 01:07:36.384
I do not need them.

01:07:36.385 --> 01:07:37.989
All I need is you.

01:07:39.522 --> 01:07:41.092
Let's not go in the morning.

01:07:46.395 --> 01:07:47.931
You do not go away.

01:07:51.967 --> 01:07:53.571
I will not.

01:07:58.207 --> 01:07:59.880
I promise.

01:09:01.904 --> 01:09:02.939
Hey.

01:09:04.607 --> 01:09:05.881
Hey.

01:09:10.979 --> 01:09:12.425
Remy.

01:09:39.140 --> 01:09:41.242
<i>You're crazy, are not you?</i>

01:09:41.243 --> 01:09:43.077
What do you think you're doing?

01:09:43.078 --> 01:09:44.946
You can only stay around
at the scene of a crime

01:09:44.947 --> 01:09:46.680
giving a positive
signal, his asshole.

01:09:46.682 --> 01:09:47.982
You could have hit me.

01:09:47.983 --> 01:09:48.983
Right.

01:09:48.984 --> 01:09:49.684
What do you mean, right?

01:09:49.685 --> 01:09:52.187
It's not right, sit down!

01:09:52.188 --> 01:09:54.189
I'm very angry now.

01:09:54.189 --> 01:09:56.227
Sorry, I'm sorry.

01:09:57.927 --> 01:09:59.998
You have much to learn.

01:10:08.571 --> 01:10:10.141
You're not worth my time.

01:10:13.976 --> 01:10:15.614
<i>So teach me.</i>

01:10:49.245 --> 01:10:51.054
It's time.

01:10:56.752 --> 01:10:58.231
The hands on the jacket.

01:11:10.966 --> 01:11:12.673
Do not worry.

01:11:14.670 --> 01:11:16.004
Think for a second.

01:11:16.005 --> 01:11:18.573
What are you going to do with me?

01:11:18.574 --> 01:11:19.707
I want answers.

01:11:19.708 --> 01:11:21.051
Keep walking.

01:11:22.111 --> 01:11:24.312
Let me go.

01:11:24.313 --> 01:11:26.047
You do not go anywhere,

01:11:26.048 --> 01:11:27.215
do not until I get the answers.

01:11:27.216 --> 01:11:29.025
I have no answer for you, boy.

01:11:30.019 --> 01:11:31.219
Sit down.

01:11:31.220 --> 01:11:33.097
- Let's go now...
- Sit down!

01:11:34.023 --> 01:11:35.331
It's all right.

01:11:37.993 --> 01:11:39.768
IM sitting.

01:11:41.163 --> 01:11:43.431
Now I want to know

01:11:43.432 --> 01:11:45.099
what did you do with her.

01:11:45.100 --> 01:11:47.635
Maya, where is she?

01:11:47.636 --> 01:11:48.979
The problem is that you do not even know

01:11:49.038 --> 01:11:50.415
What you want.

01:11:51.807 --> 01:11:54.175
I mean how could you?

01:11:54.176 --> 01:11:56.713
You do not even know his name.

01:11:58.747 --> 01:11:59.747
Come on, let's stop...

01:11:59.748 --> 01:12:01.284
Who did this to me?

01:12:03.252 --> 01:12:05.061
Who did this to me?

01:12:06.121 --> 01:12:07.998
Why am I like this?

01:12:15.030 --> 01:12:16.236
He's the Mockenrue.

01:12:28.377 --> 01:12:32.348
Mockenrue.

01:12:39.655 --> 01:12:41.100
Get off him.

01:12:42.391 --> 01:12:44.992
You almost killed him, you idiot.

01:12:44.993 --> 01:12:47.028
He has the answers we need.

01:12:47.029 --> 01:12:48.129
He said Mockenrue.

01:12:48.130 --> 01:12:49.263
What?

01:12:49.264 --> 01:12:50.798
Mockenrue, I've heard
that name before.

01:12:50.799 --> 01:12:52.734
What are you talking about?

01:12:52.735 --> 01:12:54.373
You let it be.

01:13:17.359 --> 01:13:18.292
<i>Damn you.</i>

01:13:18.293 --> 01:13:19.660
<i>What did you do?</i>

01:13:19.661 --> 01:13:22.130
You must help the
boy, do not kill him.

01:13:22.131 --> 01:13:24.165
<i>He just screwed it up.</i>

01:13:24.166 --> 01:13:25.299
<i>He tried to kill me.</i>

01:13:25.300 --> 01:13:26.701
<i>What?</i>

01:13:26.702 --> 01:13:27.769
<i>I told you, Andrew was going to start.</i>

01:13:27.770 --> 01:13:29.203
<i>killing someone.</i>

01:13:29.204 --> 01:13:32.447
<i>Enough, check.</i>

01:13:34.009 --> 01:13:35.181
<i>Is he dead?</i>

01:13:37.012 --> 01:13:38.479
No, he's still breathing.

01:13:38.480 --> 01:13:40.748
Right.

01:13:40.749 --> 01:13:44.419
I think the time is now, we
just have to finish this.

01:13:44.420 --> 01:13:46.154
Let's get him on the train.

01:13:46.155 --> 01:13:47.722
It's the bloody hour, Reverend.

01:13:47.723 --> 01:13:49.066
Let's go.

01:14:01.236 --> 01:14:04.445
<i>The next stop is Seven Sisters.</i>

01:14:05.941 --> 01:14:08.046
<i>Next stop, Seven Sisters.</i>

01:16:32.521 --> 01:16:34.159
You did it.

01:16:36.091 --> 01:16:37.434
I knew you would.

01:16:39.428 --> 01:16:41.533
I always said you
were brilliant.

01:16:43.131 --> 01:16:44.337
Provider.

01:16:47.336 --> 01:16:48.508
It's me.

01:16:54.209 --> 01:16:56.189
Look at you.

01:16:58.413 --> 01:17:03.226
I'm well satisfied.

01:17:07.422 --> 01:17:09.424
I bet you'd like some answers.

01:17:10.425 --> 01:17:12.166
Would you like to sit down?

01:17:14.496 --> 01:17:16.339
Do you mind if I sit down?

01:17:18.233 --> 01:17:19.439
Do not you?

01:17:21.203 --> 01:17:22.477
Right.

01:17:29.177 --> 01:17:30.520
Where to start?

01:17:35.050 --> 01:17:38.285
I'm a problem solver,
I've been all my life.

01:17:38.286 --> 01:17:43.235
and I'm very good at it,
if I do not say I'm good.

01:17:48.497 --> 01:17:51.298
I missed a lot,

01:17:51.299 --> 01:17:55.269
<i>so many people I loved</i>

01:17:55.270 --> 01:17:57.147
<i>and I took care</i>

01:17:58.273 --> 01:18:00.253
<i>by violence and violence.</i>

01:18:02.210 --> 01:18:06.454
<i>I had a daughter years ago.</i>

01:18:09.051 --> 01:18:10.257
<i>Elle.</i>

01:18:12.154 --> 01:18:13.497
<i>She was my light.</i>

01:18:23.065 --> 01:18:25.204
<i>It was a week before
the police found it.</i>

01:18:29.337 --> 01:18:31.146
<i>That set me up.</i>

01:18:50.358 --> 01:18:53.327
I saw the problem
as many people have

01:18:53.328 --> 01:18:55.696
in life and I saw it worsen

01:18:55.697 --> 01:18:59.300
without foreseeing to end.

01:18:59.301 --> 01:19:03.249
So I decided I had no other way.

01:19:04.339 --> 01:19:07.274
We've done so much
to solve problems

01:19:07.275 --> 01:19:09.076
which are wiping out our planet.

01:19:09.077 --> 01:19:11.278
Environmental collapse, disease,

01:19:11.279 --> 01:19:13.647
hunger and what do we do?

01:19:13.648 --> 01:19:17.351
We look to science for healing,

01:19:17.352 --> 01:19:22.392
Possible solutions to avoid
catastrophes, right?

01:19:24.226 --> 01:19:25.626
We did not even go
far to configure

01:19:25.627 --> 01:19:28.729
institutions around
the world to study

01:19:28.730 --> 01:19:32.533
the idea of violence
and analyze what is,

01:19:32.534 --> 01:19:36.604
but you see, I grew impatient.

01:19:36.605 --> 01:19:40.474
I was not satisfied with
mere academic recognition.

01:19:40.475 --> 01:19:42.343
I wanted something done.

01:19:42.344 --> 01:19:44.290
I wanted action.

01:19:45.947 --> 01:19:47.187
Look.

01:19:47.716 --> 01:19:51.352
Peace remained

01:19:51.353 --> 01:19:53.287
an unreachable phenomenon.

01:19:53.288 --> 01:19:55.556
It's not simple to
worry about it,

01:19:55.557 --> 01:19:57.691
but it is something that is spoken

01:19:57.692 --> 01:19:59.493
from the beginning of time.

01:19:59.494 --> 01:20:01.405
Peace never existed.

01:20:01.463 --> 01:20:05.199
It was always something we
always fantasized about

01:20:05.200 --> 01:20:08.469
and evangelized, was
always out of reach.

01:20:08.470 --> 01:20:11.605
A hope that one day,

01:20:11.606 --> 01:20:15.486
we could keep.

01:20:17.379 --> 01:20:19.552
But I'm tired of waiting.

01:20:22.651 --> 01:20:25.393
I've lost my hope
for a long time.

01:20:27.255 --> 01:20:28.563
Until you came.

01:20:29.991 --> 01:20:35.202
You're my hope, my
try for a solution.

01:20:36.565 --> 01:20:39.433
An attempt at peace, if
you see that it really is

01:20:39.434 --> 01:20:41.602
beyond our reach,
if nature denies us

01:20:41.603 --> 01:20:44.311
this right to all.

01:20:47.542 --> 01:20:48.680
You.

01:20:52.614 --> 01:20:55.254
How can you do this to me?

01:20:57.052 --> 01:20:58.619
I've never had a chance.

01:20:58.620 --> 01:21:00.463
A chance for what?

01:21:03.959 --> 01:21:05.495
You do not see it.

01:21:07.429 --> 01:21:09.238
No, I do not see it.

01:21:11.233 --> 01:21:14.735
I've never seen anything
because of you.

01:21:14.736 --> 01:21:18.339
I ventured, I saw the way
you could have taken,

01:21:18.340 --> 01:21:19.773
I lived in the first place.

01:21:19.774 --> 01:21:22.443
I saved you every
night without sleep.

01:21:22.444 --> 01:21:23.711
and the rodent void,

01:21:23.712 --> 01:21:26.480
that enigmatic pain that
consumes our species,

01:21:26.481 --> 01:21:30.084
I wanted to give you something else.

01:21:30.085 --> 01:21:31.552
Your mother died in childbirth.

01:21:31.553 --> 01:21:33.487
You had no father, no
family, no friends,

01:21:33.488 --> 01:21:36.264
So I adopted you.

01:21:42.564 --> 01:21:46.066
<i>We take care of you
together, Sara and me.</i>

01:21:46.067 --> 01:21:48.636
<i>You were our new beginning.</i>

01:21:48.637 --> 01:21:52.744
<i>A reason for us to
go on, to exist.</i>

01:21:59.114 --> 01:22:00.491
Sara.

01:22:01.583 --> 01:22:04.530
Yes, Sara was my partner.

01:22:08.456 --> 01:22:10.493
<i>She loved you like a son.</i>

01:22:12.427 --> 01:22:13.565
<i>Really.</i>

01:22:15.530 --> 01:22:18.565
<i>She was very attached to the
family, had to leave the project.</i>

01:22:18.566 --> 01:22:19.700
<i>She wanted to bring you.</i>

01:22:19.701 --> 01:22:21.702
Yes!

01:22:21.703 --> 01:22:25.606
<i>She could not continue, she
had to leave the project,</i>

01:22:25.607 --> 01:22:28.588
<i>leaving me with everything.</i>

01:22:51.700 --> 01:22:55.069
So I continued,
but in that time,

01:22:55.070 --> 01:22:57.037
you were too old
to be left alone.

01:22:57.038 --> 01:22:59.746
The only thing left
was to teach you.

01:23:01.309 --> 01:23:04.645
You were really
brilliant, your knowledge

01:23:04.646 --> 01:23:07.047
was prodigious perhaps for
lack of encouragement,

01:23:07.048 --> 01:23:10.518
but you have learned in
an unbelievable way.

01:23:11.619 --> 01:23:13.565
Faster than anyone,
I've never seen it.

01:23:16.624 --> 01:23:18.297
It's all right here.

01:23:19.594 --> 01:23:21.665
Notebooks, magazines.

01:23:23.131 --> 01:23:25.577
Two and a half
decades from my job.

01:23:27.068 --> 01:23:28.570
Our work.

01:23:36.578 --> 01:23:38.057
Look at this.

01:23:41.383 --> 01:23:42.726
Do you remember?

01:23:59.701 --> 01:24:00.611
Maya.

01:24:03.438 --> 01:24:05.645
<i>She should never have found you.</i>

01:24:08.109 --> 01:24:10.612
<i>She put all my work in danger.</i>

01:24:13.648 --> 01:24:15.115
<i>Bluebell?</i>

01:24:15.116 --> 01:24:16.650
<i>Bluebell!</i>

01:24:16.651 --> 01:24:19.586
<i>Sara and I made a mistake.</i>

01:24:19.587 --> 01:24:23.724
<i>Maya was our daughter but
I could not leave her.</i>

01:24:23.725 --> 01:24:26.193
<i>influence the project.</i>

01:24:26.194 --> 01:24:29.596
<i>So I sent her away.</i>

01:24:29.597 --> 01:24:32.942
<i>and I got distanced.</i>

01:24:34.069 --> 01:24:37.438
<i>She never understood and
after all those years</i>

01:24:37.439 --> 01:24:40.648
<i>of negligence, she left.</i>

01:24:45.046 --> 01:24:46.480
Where is she?

01:24:46.481 --> 01:24:49.950
With me and now, I'm sure.

01:24:49.951 --> 01:24:52.693
Learning that his
whole life was a lie.

01:24:54.155 --> 01:24:58.934
It is too much to discover, I
am sure you are discovering.

01:25:04.099 --> 01:25:05.476
Come on, Lucas.

01:25:07.435 --> 01:25:09.073
Walk with your legs.

01:25:12.707 --> 01:25:15.409
Keep it underneath.

01:25:15.410 --> 01:25:16.510
What are you doing?

01:25:16.511 --> 01:25:18.679
Peter did not say
anything about a tattoo.

01:25:18.680 --> 01:25:21.014
I do not see Peter here, right?

01:25:21.015 --> 01:25:23.550
I'm in charge now.

01:25:23.551 --> 01:25:25.219
<i>Jesus Christ.</i>

01:25:25.220 --> 01:25:26.920
You're a liar.

01:25:26.921 --> 01:25:29.723
Only one more of the
many who saw this

01:25:29.724 --> 01:25:32.898
What you've done here is only one part.

01:25:35.130 --> 01:25:38.765
I've been watching you
for a very long time.

01:25:38.766 --> 01:25:40.134
<i>You trust me, do not you?</i>

01:25:40.135 --> 01:25:41.969
<i>Of course I trust you,</i>

01:25:41.970 --> 01:25:45.005
<i>but this is not your fault, it's his.</i>

01:25:45.006 --> 01:25:48.675
<i>No, I was part, I
agreed with that,</i>

01:25:48.676 --> 01:25:50.010
<i>but not too far away.</i>

01:25:50.011 --> 01:25:53.747
<i>You can not see it,
it's just a child.</i>

01:25:53.748 --> 01:25:58.060
<i>No, it's an experiment.</i>

01:26:03.725 --> 01:26:05.204
Nothing was mine?

01:26:06.895 --> 01:26:08.662
What is mine?

01:26:08.663 --> 01:26:10.164
Time for someone?

01:26:10.165 --> 01:26:12.941
A smile?

01:26:14.502 --> 01:26:16.482
What is in here.

01:26:17.172 --> 01:26:19.640
What is not yours?

01:26:19.641 --> 01:26:22.144
<i>Everything is yours, you
can keep everything.</i>

01:26:24.078 --> 01:26:26.080
I do not belong here.

01:26:29.117 --> 01:26:30.717
I have nothing.

01:26:30.718 --> 01:26:32.061
For what?

01:26:33.054 --> 01:26:35.689
So it's all over

01:26:35.690 --> 01:26:38.091
after what happened now.

01:26:38.092 --> 01:26:39.935
You are free.

01:26:41.963 --> 01:26:42.907
Free.

01:26:42.964 --> 01:26:47.936
To choose, to act, to forgive.

01:26:48.736 --> 01:26:53.736
You have a chance
to renew our hope.

01:26:53.975 --> 01:26:58.212
It all depends on what
you decide to do now.

01:26:58.213 --> 01:27:01.081
Remember why you are here,

01:27:01.082 --> 01:27:02.983
you need to keep the plan.

01:27:02.984 --> 01:27:04.551
Do not touch me.

01:27:04.552 --> 01:27:05.919
Listen to me.

01:27:05.920 --> 01:27:09.089
You have every
right to look bad.

01:27:09.090 --> 01:27:13.627
Believe me, I understand
what you're feeling.

01:27:13.628 --> 01:27:16.296
Do you understand how I feel?

01:27:16.297 --> 01:27:18.732
You do not have to tell me that.

01:27:18.733 --> 01:27:19.933
You said you were my brother,

01:27:19.934 --> 01:27:21.969
Why did you tell me that?

01:27:21.970 --> 01:27:23.537
What did he say?

01:27:23.538 --> 01:27:25.609
You said I needed to
kill the Provider.

01:27:27.008 --> 01:27:29.309
Just calm down, take it easy.

01:27:29.310 --> 01:27:31.678
I want Maya.

01:27:31.679 --> 01:27:34.214
We told you, she was gone,
it was too much for her.

01:27:34.215 --> 01:27:36.350
She had a choice,
just like you did

01:27:36.351 --> 01:27:38.151
and she left.

01:27:38.152 --> 01:27:39.319
I do not believe you.

01:27:39.320 --> 01:27:40.320
Do not you?

01:27:40.321 --> 01:27:42.055
She told you she was going.

01:27:42.056 --> 01:27:43.323
or where?

01:27:43.324 --> 01:27:44.691
She was taken.

01:27:44.692 --> 01:27:46.262
Was?

01:27:55.770 --> 01:27:57.306
Bluebell?

01:28:00.642 --> 01:28:02.679
M م e?

01:28:02.877 --> 01:28:05.345
<i>Sarah told all about</i>

01:28:05.346 --> 01:28:07.981
<i>his regrettable existence,
if he can call it that.</i>

01:28:07.982 --> 01:28:11.184
<i>How did you eat remains in the dark, in</i>

01:28:11.185 --> 01:28:14.955
<i>one by a psychic madman.</i>

01:28:14.956 --> 01:28:18.892
She knows who you
are, what you are.

01:28:18.893 --> 01:28:23.035
and she left, just like him.

01:28:30.338 --> 01:28:31.972
Why are we here?

01:28:31.973 --> 01:28:35.976
Because I trusted
the wrong people.

01:28:35.977 --> 01:28:38.245
I was ready.

01:28:38.246 --> 01:28:40.021
I had things.

01:28:41.182 --> 01:28:43.128
I lost everything.

01:28:44.218 --> 01:28:46.027
Now I have nothing.

01:28:47.255 --> 01:28:50.157
This is what happens
when you put faith

01:28:50.158 --> 01:28:52.604
in the wrong people.

01:28:54.362 --> 01:28:56.603
They take it all from you.

01:29:00.902 --> 01:29:03.041
You have to remember that.

01:29:04.639 --> 01:29:07.085
It's time to finish this.

01:29:16.084 --> 01:29:18.285
Where is she?

01:29:18.286 --> 01:29:21.130
I told you, she's gone.

01:29:30.998 --> 01:29:33.000
What did he say to you?

01:29:34.068 --> 01:29:35.702
What did he do?

01:29:35.703 --> 01:29:39.439
He's ruined everything,
all my work.

01:29:39.440 --> 01:29:41.041
Where is she?

01:29:41.042 --> 01:29:42.309
Bluebell?

01:29:42.310 --> 01:29:46.918
I do not know, I have not
seen her for a long time.

01:29:47.682 --> 01:29:49.349
You took it from me.

01:29:49.350 --> 01:29:51.193
No, no, I...

01:29:53.254 --> 01:29:55.188
Do not.

01:29:55.189 --> 01:29:57.032
You ruined my life.

01:29:57.091 --> 01:30:01.665
I tried to help you,
I tried to save you.

01:30:02.764 --> 01:30:04.231
Do you remember the last
thing I said to you?

01:30:04.232 --> 01:30:06.178
Before I let you out?

01:30:09.370 --> 01:30:11.145
That's it.

01:30:20.114 --> 01:30:22.321
<i>An end to all silence.</i>

01:30:42.203 --> 01:30:43.773
Excuse me.

01:30:59.787 --> 01:31:01.130
Father.

01:31:03.524 --> 01:31:05.970
Why did you do that with me?

01:31:29.217 --> 01:31:31.318
<i>There will be a day when everything</i>

01:31:31.319 --> 01:31:33.458
<i>will change for you.</i>

01:31:35.156 --> 01:31:38.458
<i>you will lose everything
you have ever loved.</i>

01:31:38.459 --> 01:31:41.094
<i>Everything you had next.</i>

01:31:41.095 --> 01:31:43.268
<i>everything that you've
already believed.</i>

01:31:45.299 --> 01:31:48.235
<i>When this time comes, I
want you to remember</i>

01:31:48.236 --> 01:31:50.147
<i>What I told you about now.</i>

01:31:54.275 --> 01:31:57.347
<i>I loved you as a son.</i>

01:31:57.411 --> 01:32:01.248
<i>You know that everything you've been through,</i>

01:32:01.249 --> 01:32:04.017
<i>everything that I never gave you</i>

01:32:04.018 --> 01:32:06.157
<i>did not have to see with love.</i>

01:32:27.208 --> 01:32:31.278
<i>You can not understand
now, but you will.</i>

01:32:31.279 --> 01:32:34.954
<i>The next stop is Seven Sisters.</i>

01:32:39.086 --> 01:32:41.187
<i>You are everything I worked for</i>

01:32:41.188 --> 01:32:43.225
<i>and wait.</i>

01:32:44.292 --> 01:32:46.272
<i>And you're all I leave.</i>

01:32:48.629 --> 01:32:51.398
<i>Everything ends in a moment</i>

01:32:51.399 --> 01:32:54.073
<i>and a decision.</i>

01:33:03.010 --> 01:33:07.380
Please remember
this and know that

01:33:07.381 --> 01:33:09.156
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

01:33:18.593 --> 01:33:20.231
<i>Are you awake?</i>

01:33:23.230 --> 01:33:24.573
<i>Go to sleep.</i>
