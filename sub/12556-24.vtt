02:40.118 --> 02:41.370
IT IS ONE THING,
GENTLEMEN,

02:41.453 --> 02:42.818
TO STOP A

02:42.871 --> 02:43.952
FROM FORT KNOX
TO LOS ANGELES

02:44.039 --> 02:46.155
AND STEAL ITS CARGO.

02:46.249 --> 02:49.537
IT'S ANOTHER THING TO
REMAIN FREE TO SPEND IT.

02:49.628 --> 02:52.165

WE SHALL.

02:52.255 --> 02:54.337

02:54.424 --> 02:57.166
DON'T YOU KNOW,
MR. DeCRUZ?

02:57.260 --> 02:59.251
I VVOULD'\/E THOUGHT THAT

03:37.926 --> 03:39.462
YOU KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE DOING--

03:39.553 --> 03:41.043
I'VE EXPLAINED IT
VERY PRECISELY TO YOU.

03:41.138 --> 03:42.720
<i>ALL FOUR OF US

03:42.806 --> 03:44.592
<i>IN A STATE OF

03:44.683 --> 03:46.219
AND WHEN
WE WAKE UP,

03:46.268 --> 03:48.600
THAT'S WHEN WE'LL
TAKE OUR GOLD

03:48.687 --> 03:50.052
AND ENJOY IT.

03:50.147 --> 03:52.309
I SAY EVERYBODY
TAKES HIS CUT NOW

03:52.399 --> 03:54.310

HIS OWN CHANCES.

03:54.401 --> 03:57.063
WHAT YOU
SAY, DeCRUZ--

03:57.154 --> 03:59.145
BUT THAT AIN'T
WHAT WE AGREED ON.

03:59.239 --> 04:01.071
VVE AGREED VVE'D
STASH THE GOLD HERE

04:01.158 --> 04:02.990
AND THEN DO WHATEVER
FARVVELL TELLS US TO DO.

04:03.076 --> 04:04.908
SO FAR HE AIN'T
BEEN WRONG--

04:04.953 --> 04:07.320
NOT ABOUT ANYTHING.

04:07.414 --> 04:09.906
THE TRAIN,
THE GOLD...

04:09.958 --> 04:12.325

04:12.419 --> 04:14.660
A WHOLE TRAINLOAD
OF PEOPLE TO SLEEP--

04:14.755 --> 04:16.245
EVERYTHING.

04:16.339 --> 04:18.421
ALL WE HAD
TO DO WAS

04:18.466 --> 04:21.505
STEP OVER A LOT OF
HORIZONTAL FOLKS SNORING.

04:21.595 --> 04:25.463
TRANSFER A FORTUNE LIKE

04:25.557 --> 04:27.264
AMEN TO THAT.

04:27.309 --> 04:28.925
AMEN TO
THAT, SURE.

04:29.019 --> 04:30.851
BUT HOW ABOUT
TO THIS?

04:30.937 --> 04:33.474
NONE OF YOU MIND
BEING HELPLESS

04:33.565 --> 04:36.023
AND... CLOSED

04:36.109 --> 04:40.524
NO, MR. DeCRUZ.

04:40.614 --> 04:45.359
NONE OF US MIND.

04:45.452 --> 04:47.534
HOW LONG, FARWELL?

04:47.621 --> 04:50.784
HOW LONG?

04:50.832 --> 04:52.698
I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY.

04:52.793 --> 04:54.204
I CAN ONLY SURMISE.

04:54.294 --> 04:57.377
I WOULD SAY THAT...

04:57.464 --> 04:59.330
