00:02.450 --> 00:04.117
Hey, gentlemen.
Hey. - Hey.

00:04.119 --> 00:05.919
Hello.
If any of you are looking for

00:05.921 --> 00:08.821
something to do on Valentine's
Day, Amy and I'll be streaming

00:08.823 --> 00:12.058
our first-ever live episode
of <i> Fun With Flags.</i>

00:12.060 --> 00:14.360
You're welcome to join us
as we celebrate the timeless

00:14.362 --> 00:18.331
love affair between
wind and flapping fabric.

00:18.333 --> 00:20.500
Penny and I have dinner
reservations that night,

00:20.502 --> 00:23.002
but any other time, no.

00:24.773 --> 00:25.838
Sorry, Bernie and I
are breaking in

00:25.840 --> 00:27.874
the new hot tub,
if you know what I mean.

00:27.876 --> 00:29.909
Not a clue. Raj?

00:29.911 --> 00:32.579
Spending Valentine's Day
with Emily.

00:32.581 --> 00:33.813
You don't sound

00:33.815 --> 00:35.181
very excited about it.

00:35.183 --> 00:37.450
Oh, I am, I am.
I g... I guess

00:37.452 --> 00:39.819
I'm still wondering if Emily
and I are right for each other.

00:39.821 --> 00:42.989
Does this have to do with
that girl you had coffee with?

00:42.991 --> 00:46.159
You mean the strong, sexy angel
I can't stop thinking about?

00:46.161 --> 00:48.361
Who can say?

00:48.363 --> 00:51.197
You've been talking about
breaking up with Emily forever.

00:51.199 --> 00:52.999
Why don't you just do it already?
Yeah, just

00:53.001 --> 00:54.167
get it over with.
Well, you

00:54.169 --> 00:55.368
say it like it's easy.

00:55.370 --> 00:56.569
Have any one of you

00:56.571 --> 00:58.438
ever broken up with anyone?

01:02.077 --> 01:04.677
No.
Not really.

01:04.679 --> 01:08.381
You know, uh, once I ordered
an Uber by accident.

01:08.383 --> 01:11.751
I just got in
and went somewhere.

01:41.651 --> 01:44.419
So, you really
gonna break up with her?

01:44.421 --> 01:47.989
Yeah, I think so.
Do you have any advice?

01:47.991 --> 01:50.492
Well, I have broken up
with my fair share of guys.

01:50.494 --> 01:52.794
I mean, how many times
did I break up with Leonard?

01:52.796 --> 01:55.697
I stopped
counting at four.

01:55.699 --> 01:57.732
All right, my advice to you
is do it at her place

01:57.734 --> 01:59.567
so you can leave
when you need to,

01:59.569 --> 02:00.902
uh, tell the truth,
make it quick

02:00.904 --> 02:03.505
and be prepared for tears.

02:03.507 --> 02:05.173
Oh, I'm gonna do a pre-cry
before I go in there.

02:05.175 --> 02:07.742
Really dry myself out.

02:08.645 --> 02:10.277
She meant Emily.

02:10.280 --> 02:13.648
No, I-I really didn't.

02:13.650 --> 02:16.451
You're seriously
breaking up with me?

02:16.453 --> 02:17.719
Yeah.

02:17.721 --> 02:19.187
And you thought
right before Valentine's Day

02:19.189 --> 02:20.989
was a good time to do it?

02:22.325 --> 02:25.360
You're right--
let's talk again in a few days.

02:25.362 --> 02:29.130
Hey, Claire.
Hi. It's-it's Rajesh.

02:29.132 --> 02:31.766
I was-I was wondering if you're
free for Valentine's Day?

02:31.768 --> 02:34.269
Sorry, I just got back
with my boyfriend.

02:34.271 --> 02:36.438
But I just broke up
with my girlfriend.

02:36.440 --> 02:38.406
Right before Valentine's Day?

02:38.408 --> 02:40.508
What an ass.

02:40.510 --> 02:42.844
Please take me back.
Our love was meant to be!

02:44.681 --> 02:48.116
I'm gonna all alone
on Valentine's Day.

02:50.220 --> 02:53.354
Well, you were
right-- tears.

02:54.524 --> 02:58.259
Okay, and we are live
in 22 minutes.

02:58.261 --> 03:00.161
I'm nervous.
I hope people

03:00.163 --> 03:02.964
will be around to watch even
though it's Valentine's Day.

03:02.966 --> 03:06.201
People who are fans
of an Internet show about flags?

03:06.203 --> 03:08.369
Trust me, they're around.

03:08.371 --> 03:11.139
Oh, and speaking
of Valentine's Day, I haven't

03:11.141 --> 03:12.373
forgotten about you tonight.

03:12.375 --> 03:13.541
What do you mean?

03:13.543 --> 03:15.176
Well, you've become
such an integral

03:15.178 --> 03:17.712
part of my life
as well as this show,

03:17.714 --> 03:20.949
I felt it only right to include
your name in the title.

03:20.951 --> 03:23.017
Oh.

03:23.019 --> 03:24.486
That is so sweet.

03:24.488 --> 03:27.856
So from now on, this program
will be officially known as

03:27.858 --> 03:29.858
<i>Dr. Sheldon Cooper</i>

03:29.860 --> 03:31.359
<i>and Dr. Amy</i>
<i>Farrah Fowler</i>

03:31.361 --> 03:34.362
<i>present Dr. Sheldon' Cooper's</i>
<i>Fun With Flags.</i>

03:37.701 --> 03:39.067
Catchy.

03:43.206 --> 03:47.075
I'm gonna
check the temp on the tub.

03:47.077 --> 03:48.309
Don't make it too hot.

03:48.311 --> 03:49.978
Sorry, but "too hot"

03:49.980 --> 03:52.347
is the only temperature
I come in.

03:58.021 --> 03:59.220
Look at that--

03:59.222 --> 04:01.523
you shaved it all.

04:02.792 --> 04:04.192
You're welcome.

04:06.563 --> 04:09.364
Um, question--
this is my first hot tub--

04:09.366 --> 04:12.867
is it supposed to come with
a rat flopping around in it?

04:12.869 --> 04:16.671
Ew, really? Get it out.

04:16.673 --> 04:18.572
How?
Uh...

04:18.575 --> 04:19.774
wish we had a skimmer.

04:19.776 --> 04:20.975
Uh, you turn off the jets,

04:20.976 --> 04:23.645
I'll get a strainer
from the kitchen.

04:23.647 --> 04:25.313
I don't know how
to turn off the jets.

04:25.315 --> 04:28.416
Good, I don't know
where we keep the strainer.

04:29.996 --> 04:31.940
Excuse me.

04:31.941 --> 04:33.440
Uh, bad news.

04:33.442 --> 04:35.542
The maître d' said
it's gonna be at least an hour.

04:35.544 --> 04:37.744
An hour? What? That's crazy.
We have a reservation.

04:37.746 --> 04:39.646
I know.
So what did you say?

04:39.648 --> 04:42.282
Thanks, sorry to bother you.

04:42.284 --> 04:46.253
But I said it like a badass.

04:47.423 --> 04:48.622
All right, well,
can't you, like,

04:48.624 --> 04:50.090
slip him some money
or something?

04:50.092 --> 04:52.159
Really? I've never done that
before. Does it work?

04:52.161 --> 04:54.895
Do people like money--
is that what you're asking?

04:54.897 --> 04:56.830
A... a lot of attitude
from the woman

04:56.832 --> 04:59.399
who thought MC squared
was a rapper.

04:59.401 --> 05:01.602
Now, is that a smart thing
to say on a holiday

05:01.604 --> 05:03.871
that's basically
national sex night?

05:03.873 --> 05:06.507
I'm sorry.
You're pretty, I'm stupid.

05:08.677 --> 05:10.477
Hello. Uh,

05:10.479 --> 05:12.379
just checked again
for Hofstadter.

05:12.381 --> 05:13.380
Still gonna be an hour?

05:13.382 --> 05:14.815
I'm afraid so.

05:14.817 --> 05:17.017
Okay. Thanks.

05:18.254 --> 05:19.720
Hey.

05:21.190 --> 05:22.356
I think

05:22.358 --> 05:25.058
you may have dropped this?

05:25.060 --> 05:26.660
Oh.

05:26.662 --> 05:28.295
Did anybody lose a 20?

05:28.297 --> 05:30.497
I did.

05:32.000 --> 05:38.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:40.309 --> 05:42.176
Oh, I took care of it.

05:44.547 --> 05:46.246
, we are live

05:46.248 --> 05:49.750
in five,
four, three...

05:49.752 --> 05:51.418
Oh, wait. Oh, shoot,
I already pushed the button.

05:51.420 --> 05:52.486
Never mind, we're live.

05:52.488 --> 05:54.721
Uh, hello

05:54.723 --> 05:56.623
and welcome to a
special live edition

05:56.625 --> 05:58.458
of <i> Dr. Sheldon Cooper...</i>

05:58.460 --> 06:00.961
<i>and Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler</i>
<i>present...</i>

06:00.963 --> 06:03.931
<i>Dr. Sheldon Cooper's</i>
<i>Fun With Flags.</i>

06:05.734 --> 06:07.534
Consider tonight's episode

06:07.536 --> 06:10.704
a Valentine's Day gift
for you, our viewers.

06:11.807 --> 06:14.708
It's also my gift to you.
That was clear, right?

06:14.710 --> 06:16.270
'Cause you're not
getting anything else.

06:17.947 --> 06:19.446
Since we're live,

06:19.448 --> 06:21.281
you'll finally
be able to reach out to us

06:21.283 --> 06:24.218
with your flag thoughts
and flag questions.

06:24.220 --> 06:27.621
Allow us to answer a few quick
ones that we get all the time.

06:27.623 --> 06:30.123
Uh, uh, yes, I
really am a doctor.

06:30.125 --> 06:33.193
Uh, yes, she really
is my girlfriend.

06:33.195 --> 06:36.029
No, I just blink a lot,

06:36.031 --> 06:38.265
it's not Morse code
for "rescue me."

06:45.507 --> 06:47.140
Oh, uh, ok...

06:47.142 --> 06:50.210
Uh, here's our first call.

06:50.212 --> 06:52.679
Hello, and welcome
to <i> Fun With Flags.</i>

06:52.681 --> 06:54.314
What's your question?

06:54.316 --> 06:55.882
What is wrong with me?

06:55.884 --> 06:58.085
Why am I so self-destructive?

07:00.089 --> 07:01.555
Rajesh?

07:01.557 --> 07:06.059
Yes.

07:06.061 --> 07:08.695
You two look happy--
how do you do it?

07:08.697 --> 07:09.636
I-I think it starts
with good communication.

07:09.637 --> 07:12.722
Yeah, wait, that's not a flag
question. Next caller.

07:15.304 --> 07:17.938
I hope you don't think
I'm just saying this

07:17.940 --> 07:20.474
because it's
Valentine's Day, but...

07:20.476 --> 07:22.442
I love you so much.

07:22.444 --> 07:24.678
I'm gonna put this
down your robe.

07:27.449 --> 07:29.816
It's not moving,
but I think it's still alive.

07:29.818 --> 07:33.120
Well, should we put it back
in there a few minutes?

07:34.189 --> 07:35.789
No.

07:35.791 --> 07:38.625
No, and it's not a rat,
it's a rabbit.

07:38.627 --> 07:40.894
We need to save it.

07:40.896 --> 07:42.396
Well, how do we do that?

07:42.398 --> 07:44.398
Um, I don't know,
look it up on your phone.

07:44.400 --> 07:46.466
I-I'm gonna wrap it in a towel.

07:46.468 --> 07:48.468
Um... "taking care

07:48.470 --> 07:50.604
of injured rabbit."

07:50.606 --> 07:51.938
Okay.

07:51.940 --> 07:54.274
Make sure
it's comfortable and warm.

07:54.276 --> 07:57.411
Well, it was just in a hot tub.
I'm gonna say "check."

07:57.413 --> 07:58.845
Anything else?

07:58.847 --> 08:00.147
To make sure it's
not dehydrated,

08:00.149 --> 08:01.515
feed him an
electrolyte solution.

08:01.517 --> 08:02.783
If it's not responding,

08:02.785 --> 08:06.153
use a warm cloth to wash
its face and genitals.

08:08.090 --> 08:10.290
Yeah.

08:13.329 --> 08:14.795
This is ridiculous.

08:14.797 --> 08:16.963
You know, I'm gonna
go talk to the maître d'.

08:16.965 --> 08:18.432
What are you gonna say?

08:18.434 --> 08:21.134
I don't know.
I'm... I'm gonna flirt with him.

08:21.136 --> 08:23.437
I don't know
if I'm comfortable with that.

08:23.439 --> 08:25.138
I'm still
sleeping with you tonight.

08:25.140 --> 08:28.342
See if you can
get a table by the window.

08:31.780 --> 08:34.313
Hi there.
What's your name?

08:34.316 --> 08:35.482
Glen.
Oh, boy,

08:35.484 --> 08:38.452
it is crazy in here
tonight, huh, Glen?

08:38.453 --> 08:41.221
Well, you know, Valentine's Day.
Yes. Oh,

08:41.222 --> 08:44.157
bet your girlfriend is super
bummed you had to work tonight.

08:45.094 --> 08:47.327
Anyway, look, we have been
waiting a while,

08:47.329 --> 08:48.762
and I just...
With all

08:48.764 --> 08:51.765
due respect, ma'am,
there's nothing I can do.

08:51.767 --> 08:54.835
You don't have to call me ma'am.

08:54.837 --> 08:56.303
Okay.
I mean,

08:56.305 --> 08:57.537
we're basically the same age.

08:57.539 --> 08:59.373
Okay.

09:03.579 --> 09:04.778
How old are you?

09:04.780 --> 09:07.080
I'm 21. How old are you?

09:07.983 --> 09:09.449
Just shut up, Glen.

09:10.586 --> 09:12.119
Come on, let's get out of here.

09:12.121 --> 09:15.222
What? Why?
Because I'm young. Let's go.

09:16.425 --> 09:18.992
Rajesh,
it's perfectly normal

09:18.994 --> 09:21.428
to have doubts
after breaking up with someone.

09:21.430 --> 09:23.230
Well, you really think so?

09:23.232 --> 09:25.365
Yeah, you know
what's not normal?

09:25.367 --> 09:28.802
Blubbering about emotions
during a flag show.

09:28.804 --> 09:31.972
Unless that emotion is
excitement over New Zealand

09:31.974 --> 09:33.540
changing their flag.

09:33.542 --> 09:36.943
Yeah, good luck, you crazy
Kiwis, we're rooting for you.

09:36.945 --> 09:38.945
Your friend is hurting.

09:38.947 --> 09:40.313
No,

09:40.315 --> 09:41.548
Sheldon's right.

09:41.550 --> 09:42.783
Emily did say I always

09:42.785 --> 09:44.818
talk about my feelings too much.

09:44.820 --> 09:46.686
I-I suppose that

09:46.688 --> 09:49.423
could be a legitimate
concern in a relationship.

09:49.425 --> 09:52.292
Uh, perhaps even
a-a red flag.

09:52.294 --> 09:54.528
And speaking
of red flags,

09:54.530 --> 09:57.864
check out this sexy number
from the former Soviet Union.

09:57.866 --> 09:59.666
Hubba, hubba.

10:01.937 --> 10:05.005
Oh. Uh, we-we have
another caller.

10:05.007 --> 10:07.741
Hi. You're on
<i>Fun with Flags.</i>

10:07.743 --> 10:13.346
Hello. I want to talk
about how lonely I am, too.

10:13.348 --> 10:15.415
Kripke? Is that you?

10:15.417 --> 10:17.918
Yeah, I'm just sitting here
all by myself

10:17.920 --> 10:21.221
wondering if I'll ever find
someone to share my life with.

10:21.223 --> 10:23.857
Preferably Asian, 18-24,
no fatties.

10:26.495 --> 10:29.463
Please, all comments
and questions

10:29.465 --> 10:31.164
should be flag-related.

10:31.166 --> 10:35.101
All right. Is my pole
flag-related?

10:41.376 --> 10:44.644
I don't see why not.

10:52.497 --> 10:54.664
He's eating.
That's a good sign.

10:54.666 --> 10:56.533
You're gonna have
to wait one hour

10:56.535 --> 10:58.868
until you can go swimming again.

11:00.339 --> 11:03.006
He's pretty cute.
He is.

11:03.008 --> 11:05.909
Should we... name him?

11:05.911 --> 11:07.978
It is Valentine's Day.

11:07.980 --> 11:10.113
How about Valentino?

11:10.949 --> 11:14.084
Nice. A classic rabbit name.

11:15.687 --> 11:19.756
Peter Rabbit, Roger Rabbit.
Valentino Wolowitz Rabbit.

11:21.426 --> 11:24.160
Oh, look at all that
chest hair and overbite.

11:24.162 --> 11:25.929
Of course you're a Wolowitz.

11:27.866 --> 11:30.066
Son of a bitch! He bit me!

11:30.068 --> 11:31.968
Are you okay?

11:31.970 --> 11:33.336
No, I'm not okay!

11:33.338 --> 11:35.238
Wild rabbits
can have rabies!

11:35.240 --> 11:38.074
Oh. Well, why did you put
your finger near its mouth?

11:38.076 --> 11:40.910
Poor judgment, obviously.

11:40.912 --> 11:44.514
He's so little. I'm sure it's fine.
How can it be fine?

11:44.516 --> 11:48.118
I just got attacked by a clearly
anti-Semitic wild animal.

11:50.389 --> 11:54.457
It's not what we planned,
but this isn't so bad, right?

11:54.459 --> 11:57.927
It is freaking amazing.

11:57.929 --> 12:00.463
Well, glad
you're feeling better.

12:00.465 --> 12:02.499
I was just hungry and cranky,

12:02.501 --> 12:05.001
and I've never been called
"ma'am" before.

12:05.003 --> 12:06.503
Is that a big deal?

12:06.505 --> 12:09.472
Kind of. When was the first time
someone called you "sir"?

12:09.474 --> 12:10.907
Sixth grade,

12:10.909 --> 12:13.843
but I wore a sport coat
and carried a briefcase, so...

12:14.679 --> 12:17.781
Can you believe
when I met you I was 22?

12:17.783 --> 12:19.682
I mean, it's crazy!

12:19.684 --> 12:21.384
Where did all that time go?

12:21.386 --> 12:25.388
Mm, you watched
<i>The Bachelor</i> a lot.

12:25.390 --> 12:27.223
Yeah, go ahead and make jokes,

12:27.225 --> 12:28.958
but your thirties
are almost over.

12:28.960 --> 12:30.393
No, they're not.

12:30.395 --> 12:32.295
You're closer to 40
than you are 30.

12:32.297 --> 12:35.865
Ha, ha! You
married an old man.

12:35.867 --> 12:37.834
Tell you what.

12:37.836 --> 12:39.335
Let's do something
fun tonight.

12:39.337 --> 12:40.637
Won't make us any younger.

12:40.639 --> 12:43.273
Well, maybe not, but some
day we actually will be old,

12:43.275 --> 12:45.108
and we'll look
back on this night

12:45.110 --> 12:47.243
and remember what
a good time we had.

12:47.245 --> 12:49.212
Okay, like what?

12:49.214 --> 12:52.315
I know. Food fight!

12:57.756 --> 13:00.356
I'll keep thinking.

13:02.694 --> 13:06.096
Look, I know you both feel bad
about being alone, but sometimes

13:06.098 --> 13:09.499
the best thing you can do is
take a little time for yourself,

13:09.501 --> 13:11.968
especially when you just
got out of a relationship.

13:11.970 --> 13:14.204
Speaking of ending
relationships,

13:14.206 --> 13:18.575
when British Honduras
became Belize,

13:18.577 --> 13:21.311
they designed a new
flag with a tree on it,

13:21.313 --> 13:25.348
and I would like to hang
myself from that tree.

13:29.688 --> 13:32.555
But, Amy,
when you and Sheldon split up,

13:32.557 --> 13:34.757
didn't you start dating someone
right away?

13:34.759 --> 13:37.293
Well, I... I wouldn't
say right away.

13:37.295 --> 13:40.263
And actually, it was
three different men.

13:40.265 --> 13:42.132
Three different men?!

13:42.134 --> 13:46.870
Damn, girl,
way to give the milk away?

13:46.872 --> 13:49.439
Oh, looks like
we just lost Kripke.

13:49.441 --> 13:52.642
Actually, I'm still here.

13:52.644 --> 13:54.677
Now?
Yup.

13:54.679 --> 13:56.513
Now?
Yup!

13:56.515 --> 13:58.515
Now?

13:58.517 --> 14:02.051
Oh, looks like
we just lost Kripke.

14:02.053 --> 14:04.020
Before Emily,
I was alone for so long.

14:04.022 --> 14:06.556
I just... I don't know
if I can do that again.

14:06.558 --> 14:08.091
Well, you know,
here is something

14:08.093 --> 14:09.425
that might cheer you up.

14:09.427 --> 14:13.396
The flag of the Isle of Man
is nothing but three legs

14:13.398 --> 14:16.733
sharing a weird pair
of underpants, so...

14:16.735 --> 14:19.002
you think you
got problems.

14:20.505 --> 14:22.505
I have an idea.

14:22.507 --> 14:24.140
Maybe someone in our audience

14:24.142 --> 14:26.075
would be interested
in meeting Rajesh.

14:26.077 --> 14:28.077
Ladies, I can attest

14:28.079 --> 14:30.113
that he is a kind,
handsome, intelligent...

14:30.115 --> 14:32.916
Rich parents!
Don't forget, rich parents!

14:34.753 --> 14:37.187
...spoiled astrophysicist
who not only...

14:38.757 --> 14:42.125
Oh. Well, that was quick.

14:42.127 --> 14:44.594
Hi. You're on
<i>Fun with Flags.</i>

14:44.596 --> 14:46.863
Hey, I think I got cut off.

14:49.401 --> 14:50.934
Hello, Kripke.

14:50.936 --> 14:53.136
I have a flag question.

14:53.138 --> 14:56.539
How many men
did you have sex with?

14:57.709 --> 15:00.877
Let's see. What's
young and fun?

15:00.879 --> 15:02.879
Uh, we could
go dancing.

15:02.881 --> 15:04.347
Are you actually
gonna dance?

15:04.349 --> 15:05.381
Of course.
Yeah.

15:05.383 --> 15:07.417
No one wants to see that.

15:07.419 --> 15:09.953
Hey, how about skinny dipping
at the beach?

15:09.955 --> 15:13.022
No, I don't need
any fish nibbling my business.

15:14.859 --> 15:16.859
Oh, there's a screening
of <i> Moulin Rouge!</i>

15:16.861 --> 15:18.628
I heard the crowd
sings along and stuff.

15:18.630 --> 15:20.330
That sounds fun.
When's it start?

15:20.332 --> 15:22.198
Midnight.

15:22.200 --> 15:23.900
Midnight. Really?

15:23.902 --> 15:25.768
You know what? Let's do it.

15:25.770 --> 15:27.337
Okay, great!

15:28.440 --> 15:30.840
Oh, wait. Uh, it's sold out.

15:30.842 --> 15:33.176
Oh, thank God.
Yes!

15:34.279 --> 15:36.579
It says, rabies
in rabbits is

15:36.581 --> 15:37.914
highly unlikely.

15:37.916 --> 15:39.849
Oh, terrific.
It's not terrific.

15:39.851 --> 15:41.618
Lots of highly unlikely things
happen.

15:41.620 --> 15:45.421
You saw what's under this robe,
and you still married me.

15:45.423 --> 15:47.624
If you're really worried,
we'll take him to the vet

15:47.626 --> 15:48.825
and have him tested.
Good.

15:48.827 --> 15:51.194
Thank you. Oh, okay,
there is a test!

15:51.196 --> 15:53.196
All they have to do is...

15:53.198 --> 15:55.231
cut off his head
and check his brain.

15:55.233 --> 15:57.367
Oh, cut off his head?

15:57.369 --> 16:01.137
That's where
his little nose is.

16:01.139 --> 16:04.440
He's not showing
any symptoms.

16:04.442 --> 16:08.211
I guess I'll just go to the
emergency room to be safe.

16:08.213 --> 16:10.480
Howie, this is just
your hypochondria.

16:10.482 --> 16:12.482
No, when I sat
on the mute button

16:12.484 --> 16:15.051
and thought I'd gone deaf,
that was my hypochondria.

16:23.628 --> 16:26.796
We'll find another time
to tell him I'm pregnant.

16:33.338 --> 16:35.471
I mean, this is the first time

16:35.473 --> 16:37.407
I've ever broken up
with someone.

16:37.409 --> 16:40.343
I just... I didn't realize
it was gonna hurt this much.

16:40.345 --> 16:42.312
It really can.

16:42.314 --> 16:44.514
All right.

16:45.817 --> 16:48.718
Nothing about
this is fun.

16:48.720 --> 16:51.521
No one wants to
talk about flags,

16:51.523 --> 16:55.024
and I haven't spoken
in over ten minutes,

16:55.026 --> 16:58.294
so, enjoy your
new show, Internet.

16:58.296 --> 17:02.965
<i>Dr. Amy Farrah Flower</i>
<i>Present... With.</i>

17:05.470 --> 17:07.502
I'm sorry for bothering you.

17:07.505 --> 17:08.938
I'll hang up now.

17:08.940 --> 17:10.473
No, hold on, Rajesh.

17:10.474 --> 17:12.375
You know, you're not being
very sympathetic.

17:12.377 --> 17:14.510
You know firsthand
that breakups are hard.

17:14.512 --> 17:16.945
Fine.

17:16.948 --> 17:19.615
If you insist on making
me a part of this,

17:19.617 --> 17:21.983
yes, I knowledge how
painful they can be.

17:21.986 --> 17:26.589
However, pain has an
evolutionary purpose.

17:26.590 --> 17:29.492
It provides information
from the environment

17:29.494 --> 17:32.061
that, uh, behavior
isn't good for us.

17:32.063 --> 17:34.530
Like when I fell in love
with that stripper

17:34.532 --> 17:36.733
and bought her a Prius.

17:38.770 --> 17:41.137
I'm just gonna push
all the buttons.

17:43.041 --> 17:45.742
Raj, now, I'm sorry
you're suffering.

17:45.744 --> 17:48.945
When Amy and I were
broken up, I also suffered.

17:48.947 --> 17:51.314
And this may
sound surprising,

17:51.316 --> 17:53.683
but I'm grateful for
having gone through it.

17:53.685 --> 17:55.685
Really?

17:55.687 --> 17:57.720
Yes.

17:57.722 --> 18:02.091
I believe our relationship
now is stronger than ever.

18:02.093 --> 18:04.694
So do I.

18:04.696 --> 18:06.129
When-when we were apart,

18:06.131 --> 18:08.297
I learned how important
you are to me.

18:08.299 --> 18:10.466
And I realize

18:10.468 --> 18:13.069
that when two people are
in love, sometimes they...

18:13.071 --> 18:15.238
Happy Valentine's Day!

18:19.077 --> 18:21.477
We are young and fun!

18:26.785 --> 18:28.818
I stand corrected.

18:28.820 --> 18:31.320
<i>Fun.</i>

18:39.940 --> 18:43.075
Congratulations on a
successful live show.

18:43.077 --> 18:45.811
And a lovely
Valentine's Day.

18:47.848 --> 18:52.050
Cleaning up
is not young and fun.

18:52.052 --> 18:54.286
It can be.
Confetti fight!

18:59.427 --> 19:01.493
Maybe you should take a break.

19:01.495 --> 19:03.028
I got this.

19:05.633 --> 19:10.836
Did you know the singular
of confetti is "confetto"?

19:10.838 --> 19:14.673
Interesting, and when
would you use the singular?

19:14.675 --> 19:15.741
I'm glad you asked.

19:15.743 --> 19:18.811
Amy, you have a
confetto in your nose.

19:18.813 --> 19:22.018
No, no, no, no. Other
side. There you go.
