<i>College has changed.</i>

02:14.475 --> 02:17.946
<i>You see, universities used to
be a place of higher learning.</i>

02:20.648 --> 02:22.984
<i>Till the administration
became corrupt.</i>

02:25.185 --> 02:27.687
<i>Tuitions skyrocketed.</i>

02:27.689 --> 02:29.991
<i>Meal plans were abolished.</i>

02:31.059 --> 02:34.392
<i>And student housing collapsed.</i>

That's a Suntour.

all funny. Skinny as hell.

07:06.758 --> 07:07.926
What a bitch.

So, I go up and just snatch
them right out of his hand,

your bike, bro.

09:34.135 --> 09:35.468
And what do they do?

They take their kid
and his $50,000 tuition,

09:39.306 --> 09:41.239
and they go
to another school.

09:41.241 --> 09:44.275
It becomes a $200,000
problem for me.

09:44.277 --> 09:46.144
- Do you know how that happens?
- Yes, sir, I...

09:46.146 --> 09:47.812
That was rhetorical.

09:51.785 --> 09:53.985
at $50,000 a year...

That's a nice camera.

28:43.746 --> 28:45.480
five, ten years out of date?

28:45.482 --> 28:46.650
Twenty!

29:08.871 --> 29:10.373

like that again, okay?

we got security on the way!

we're not retreating!

in a different direction!

bikes to the dormitory for me?

30:25.446 --> 30:26.513
Thanks.

30:33.620 --> 30:36.689
You have to believe me! They have the
stolen bikes packed in their garage.

STARVING NICO: Do you
have any pictures of this?

30:38.258 --> 30:41.361
- They broke my camera.
- STARVING SUSAN: Yeah, well, are there any witnesses?

30:42.495 --> 30:43.697
He saw it!

30:44.964 --> 30:46.497
I don't know
what she's talking about.

30:46.499 --> 30:47.864
What?

30:47.866 --> 30:50.501
(STUTTERS)
I'm telling the truth!

30:50.503 --> 30:51.636

With no evidence.

30:51.638 --> 30:53.303
Then why else
would they act like that?

STARVING HEMSLEY:
Frats will be frats, Piper.

30:54.674 --> 30:56.540
Oh, that is B.S.,
and you know it!

30:56.542 --> 30:59.510
People can't bring nice bikes and
expect them not to get stolen.

30:59.512 --> 31:01.779
STARVING HEMSLEY: Yeah, you can't
just expect us to believe you.

31:01.781 --> 31:05.015
We cannot let Palmer
keep getting away with this!

31:05.017 --> 31:08.018
STARVING SUSAN: Oh, so,
that's what this is about?

31:08.020 --> 31:09.186
STARVING HEMSLEY:
Are we back on that again?

31:09.188 --> 31:10.788
She couldn't pin ex-lover
boy with the first story,

31:10.790 --> 31:12.723
so she had to make up
a new one. Real classy.

31:12.725 --> 31:14.126
It's not a story!

31:23.869 --> 31:25.704
You think I don't know
what you're doing?

31:30.476 --> 31:32.676
You ever written anything,
Freshman?

31:32.678 --> 31:34.143
In high school.

31:34.145 --> 31:38.649
And I bet you double-sized the periods
to get an extra quarter of a page.

31:41.853 --> 31:43.017
So, what? Who didn't?

31:43.019 --> 31:44.653
I didn't.

31:44.655 --> 31:47.923
Twelve point font. Times New Roman.
One inch margins.

31:47.925 --> 31:51.394
Proper header and footer. Checked
and double-checked sources.

31:51.396 --> 31:53.162
Triple checked
for good measure.

31:53.164 --> 31:55.164
Five hundred words per page.

31:55.166 --> 31:57.932
So, when a freshman who
double-sizes his periods,

31:57.934 --> 32:00.770
cheats the margins, gets
into the same college as me,

32:00.772 --> 32:02.404
and uses that same mentality

32:02.406 --> 32:04.406
to screw other students
out of their bikes,

32:04.408 --> 32:06.076
how do you think
that makes me feel?

32:07.878 --> 32:10.246
I found my own frame.

32:10.248 --> 32:12.046
Installed my own shift
and brake cables.

32:12.048 --> 32:13.749
Found my handle bars.

32:13.751 --> 32:15.751
Fixed my own flat tires.

32:15.753 --> 32:17.721
And cleaned my chain
and cassette.

32:19.623 --> 32:21.222
I know what hard work is.

32:21.224 --> 32:23.023

still working for you?

32:23.025 --> 32:24.925
That's just the gravy,
Freshman.

32:24.927 --> 32:27.595
Here's the potatoes:
Palmer's sorority girl.

32:27.597 --> 32:29.631
I thought you said
sororities don't exist.

they made a comeback.
