Attractive,

00:20.552 --> 00:23.331
but soon the streaks will appear.

00:23.332 --> 00:25.252
The thing about
bathroom accessories is

00:25.379 --> 00:28.817
I can sell you your dream bathroom -
I'd be delighted to...

00:28.818 --> 00:31.897
but it don't mean a ting
if it ain't got that swing.

00:31.898 --> 00:33.617
The old WP.

00:33.618 --> 00:35.057
Water pressure.

00:35.058 --> 00:38.657
And I'm sorry,
but that just ain't my department.

00:38.658 --> 00:41.617
Mark, mate, you do know that
the more you talk about bathrooms,

00:41.618 --> 00:44.737
the more I feel quite strongly
that I'd like to kill myself?

00:45.010 --> 00:46.170
At least I have a job.

00:46.171 --> 00:48.809
Yeah, all right, no need to lord it,
Armitage Shanks.

00:48.810 --> 00:51.529
I've actually got a very exciting
new career lined up.

00:51.530 --> 00:53.529
You know you're too old to be
a rent boy?

00:53.530 --> 00:55.170
There's not a big market
for rent men.

00:55.171 --> 00:57.409
I'm going to be a therapist.

00:57.410 --> 01:00.089
Yes, but what kind of mad therapy?

01:00.090 --> 01:04.729
Jezicise, where you hump people
better with crystals?

01:04.730 --> 01:07.009
I guess it's better
than some of your job ideas,

01:07.010 --> 01:08.649
like becoming an admiral.

01:08.650 --> 01:10.169
I'm a highly intuitive person.

01:10.170 --> 01:13.289
I'd make a great therapist.
Look at all the pussy I bag!

01:13.290 --> 01:15.889
Is that particular quote
from Jung or Freud?

01:15.890 --> 01:18.649
I found this course -
Personal Invoicing Life Coaching.

01:18.650 --> 01:20.889
And they've got
some great-looking certificates.

01:20.890 --> 01:24.289
It's basically all the best things
about therapy and self-help

01:24.388 --> 01:25.386
but without the...

01:25.387 --> 01:26.188
Hard work?

01:26.189 --> 01:28.747
..unnecessary bolt-ons. The extras.

01:29.406 --> 01:30.325
Golf?

01:30.326 --> 01:32.285
Yeah. It's to show
that it's for wankers in shirts

01:32.326 --> 01:34.446
as well as freaks with bum bags.
It's proper, Mark.

01:35.111 --> 01:36.949
They've got a website.

01:36.950 --> 01:39.829
Oh, well, I'm sorry. If they've got
a website, the people running it

01:39.830 --> 01:42.189
definitely have fingers.
And a computer.

01:42.190 --> 01:44.309
Or at least the address
of an internet cafe.

01:44.310 --> 01:46.549
It's a week's intensive training,
and then bang, I'm out there.

01:46.563 --> 01:47.602
After a week?

01:47.603 --> 01:49.802
Mark, if it looks like a life coach

01:49.803 --> 01:52.163
and it's got a certificate
saying that it's a life coach,

01:52.164 --> 01:53.802
then it's probably a life coach.

01:53.803 --> 01:57.163
'Although it might in fact
be a failed musician with chlamydia.'

01:59.563 --> 02:01.202

I am now in the morning

02:01.203 --> 02:03.081
'and I should have been in bed

Celebrate the start-up. Cheers!

02:15.843 --> 02:18.322

02:18.323 --> 02:21.522
Good luck to you in this incredibly
hostile business environment.

02:21.523 --> 02:23.802
Thanks, man. What are you up
to right now, Mark?

02:23.803 --> 02:25.722
Me? Oh... retail.

02:25.723 --> 02:28.123
Reckon the high street's
going to make a comeback.

02:28.124 --> 02:29.322
So, er...

02:29.323 --> 02:31.643
yeah. Very exciting.

02:32.843 --> 02:34.083
Bathroom supplies.

02:34.084 --> 02:35.362
Oh!

02:35.363 --> 02:38.202
'I've dropped the B word,
and they don't know what to say.'

02:38.203 --> 02:40.842
Yes, that's my niche.
Shitting and washing.

02:40.843 --> 02:42.762
Those babies are recession-proof.

02:42.763 --> 02:45.562
Mark's also been working on a book!

02:45.563 --> 02:46.762
Oh, OK, cool!

02:46.763 --> 02:48.562
'I love you, Dobby.'

02:48.563 --> 02:49.723
Oh, it's... it's nothing.

02:49.724 --> 02:50.762
Oh. OK.

02:50.763 --> 02:52.402
Well, I mean, it is something.

02:52.403 --> 02:54.723
- I just don't want to talk about it.
- Understood.

02:56.163 --> 02:58.642
Business Secrets Of The Pharaohs,
it's called.

02:58.643 --> 03:01.842
I've got it in with several
publishers. The... initial chapters.

03:01.843 --> 03:04.162
It's good,
cos you sit down thinking,

03:04.163 --> 03:07.202
"OK, this is gonna be
fucking boring,"

03:07.203 --> 03:10.563
but then you're, like,
"Mm, maybe not!"

03:11.843 --> 03:14.562
So, what are the business secrets
of the pharaohs?

03:14.563 --> 03:16.642
Well, look, the first thing
is to acknowledge

03:16.643 --> 03:18.083
that the Ancient Egyptian era

03:18.084 --> 03:20.083
is so completely different
from our own

03:20.084 --> 03:22.842
that any cultural, political
or business parallels

03:22.843 --> 03:25.243
that we draw between the two eras
are by their very nature

03:25.244 --> 03:27.043
almost bound to be wrong.

03:31.683 --> 03:33.362
Oh, look who it is!

03:33.363 --> 03:35.162
Hey, Mark, listen.

03:35.163 --> 03:37.163
They've offered me a job
at the start-up!

03:38.243 --> 03:39.722
Oh. Wow. Great!

03:39.723 --> 03:43.202
'Oh, God, Dobby bound
more tightly with "the clique",

03:43.203 --> 03:45.482
'more endless evenings out.'

03:45.483 --> 03:48.002
I'm so bored doing IT
for the council, Mark.

03:48.003 --> 03:51.402
With any luck, it'll be one
of the 5% of internet start-ups

03:51.403 --> 03:53.842
that don't fold
within the first 18 months.

03:53.843 --> 03:55.122
Right.

03:55.123 --> 03:57.162
'God, I love those made-up stats.'

03:57.163 --> 04:00.282
It's just, ever since Gerrard died,
I've been thinking,

04:00.283 --> 04:02.922
life's so short.
You've gotta seize the day.

04:02.923 --> 04:05.882
'Gerrard! Back from the grave
to foil my plans,

04:05.883 --> 04:08.323
'like a boring Dracula.'

04:09.803 --> 04:14.122
So, welcome to
Personal Invoicing Life Coaching.

04:14.123 --> 04:17.482
I'm Celia. Everyone sit down,
and we'll get started.

04:17.483 --> 04:20.041
'So, who have we got here?
The competition.

04:20.043 --> 04:22.443
'Yeah, get your life coached
by a failed supply teacher

04:22.444 --> 04:25.722
'with the easy charm of a nonce

04:32.762 --> 04:34.043
So, did everyone get a chance

04:34.044 --> 04:36.723
to read through the course textbook
that I mentioned in my e-mail?

04:37.683 --> 04:39.202
'Fucking squares.

'Who's got time to read all the way
down to the bottom of an e-mail?'

04:42.203 --> 04:45.402
So, what did everyone think
of the core principles? Hm?

04:45.403 --> 04:47.122
How about you...

04:47.123 --> 04:48.202
Jeremy?

04:48.203 --> 04:50.202
'OK, here we go, hero or zero.'

04:50.203 --> 04:53.162
Me? Er, I thought...

04:53.163 --> 04:55.522
Well, to be honest with you,
I thought it was...

04:55.523 --> 04:56.602
shit.

04:56.603 --> 04:57.843
What, all of it?

04:57.844 --> 05:00.122
Look, I'm not gonna sit here
and regurgitate

05:00.123 --> 05:01.561
a whole load of book learning.

05:01.562 --> 05:03.323
'..that I have no idea what it is.'

05:03.324 --> 05:06.522
I mean, yeah, I read it,
and yeah... fine,

05:06.523 --> 05:08.842
but... when you're
in the head space forest,

05:08.843 --> 05:12.482
you can't look in no textbook
when you've got a 300lb emotion

05:12.483 --> 05:15.802
racing at you with its claws out,
crying.

05:15.803 --> 05:17.922
I think I know what you mean.
It's quite true.

05:17.923 --> 05:21.323
'Of course it's quite true.
I just made it up.'

05:22.763 --> 05:23.682
Hiya.

05:23.683 --> 05:24.722
Hi, Jez. Jez!

05:24.723 --> 05:27.882
Have a glass of something that
for legal reasons must call itself

05:27.883 --> 05:30.762
"sparkling grape-style
drinking wine".

05:30.763 --> 05:31.802
Er, thanks.

05:31.803 --> 05:34.043
'Have they found some legal way
to force me out of the flat?'

05:34.044 --> 05:36.082
Mark's found a publisher
for his book!

05:36.083 --> 05:38.202
Brilliant. 'His book?

05:38.203 --> 05:40.682
'What next -
he's found a director for his film,

05:40.683 --> 05:42.242
'a builder for his cathedral?'

05:42.243 --> 05:44.322
Got the e-mail today. From BL Books.

05:44.323 --> 05:46.082
Very enthusiastic.

05:46.083 --> 05:49.242
They've got a slot as long
as I can finish my rewrites ASAP.

05:49.243 --> 05:52.162
I guess what this shows
is hard work pays dividends.

05:52.163 --> 05:53.802
Mm, I know what you mean.

05:53.803 --> 05:56.762
I was working pretty hard today
on my course.

05:56.763 --> 05:57.802
Yeah. Exactly.

05:57.803 --> 06:00.083
'Appearing on I'm A Celebrity
is not the same as winning

06:00.084 --> 06:01.522
'an Olympic gold medal.'

06:01.523 --> 06:04.642
I suppose this means it's all
looking up for the El Dude Brothers,

06:04.643 --> 06:06.442
or JK Rowling and Sigmund Freud,

06:06.443 --> 06:09.123
as we should probably
start calling ourselves.

06:13.243 --> 06:16.162
'Sir Steven Redgrave and Timmy
Mallett might be more appropriate.'

06:16.163 --> 06:18.242
'I could write a book.
Piece of piss.

06:18.243 --> 06:20.802
'Chapter one. The end.
There you go. Book.'

06:20.803 --> 06:23.202
So, how was the life coaching?

06:23.203 --> 06:26.522
Good. Great, actually.
Did a load of great exercises.

06:26.523 --> 06:28.242
Pretty sure I won.

06:28.243 --> 06:30.601
Not that it's a competition,
but it was pretty clear

06:30.602 --> 06:31.683
I was the best.

06:31.684 --> 06:34.242
Actually, they want me to find
a volunteer to practise on.

06:34.243 --> 06:36.162
Well, life-coach me!

06:36.163 --> 06:39.042
I'm a gormless dweeb
stuck on the horns of a dilemma.

06:39.043 --> 06:41.042
But, Dobs, Game Of Thrones?

06:41.043 --> 06:43.403
Yeah, we can put the dragon tits
on pause, can't we?

06:43.404 --> 06:46.322
Just got to nip
to the disgustatorium.

06:46.323 --> 06:48.163
No need to think about what
I'm gonna do.

06:48.164 --> 06:50.123
Then feel free to coach my ass!

06:53.163 --> 06:56.242
Jez, will you please get your filthy
hands out of my girlfriend's brain?

06:56.243 --> 06:56.961
What?

06:56.962 --> 06:58.603
You'd better not be about to tell her

06:58.604 --> 07:01.642
to "expect more out of life"
or "follow her heart".

07:01.643 --> 07:04.322
I'm gonna tell her what's right for
her. We have a code of ethics.

07:04.323 --> 07:06.842
It's a professional discipline.
There's a pamphlet!

07:06.843 --> 07:09.602
I want to be her life coach.
We can't both be her life coach.

07:09.603 --> 07:12.602
You can't be her life coach, Mark.
You haven't got a certificate.

07:12.603 --> 07:15.882
I could if I spent 200 quid and
went to Forest Hill for five hours.

07:15.883 --> 07:18.162
OK, Jez, ready!

07:18.163 --> 07:20.682
Please, Jez! Can you coach her
that Simon's a shit

07:20.683 --> 07:22.242
and to stop hanging out with him?

07:22.243 --> 07:23.602
All right.

07:23.603 --> 07:28.122
But I'm warning you, I'm only gonna
do one unethical thing in my career.

07:28.123 --> 07:30.363
It just happens to be
the very first thing.

07:33.763 --> 07:36.202
Mark? Are you stirring your coffee

07:36.203 --> 07:39.322
very quietly without chinking
the side so I can't hear

07:39.323 --> 07:40.963
and you don't have to make one
for me?

07:40.964 --> 07:42.602
What? No!

07:42.603 --> 07:45.842
'Oh, he's rumbled
the velvet spoon routine.

07:45.843 --> 07:47.243
'That's been good for years.'

07:47.244 --> 07:49.243
Midnight coffee?
You're not gonna go barmy

07:49.244 --> 07:51.602
and start phoning up 5 live
saying you've seen

07:51.603 --> 07:54.122
the end of civilisation
in the bottom of a Bargain Bucket?

07:54.123 --> 07:57.443
Look, it's just I'm on a roll.
I've done 6,000 words since 6pm.

07:59.163 --> 08:02.242
Yeah, I know. You type like you're
trying to massacre imaginary ants

08:02.243 --> 08:03.523
swarming your keyboard.

08:03.524 --> 08:05.042
I've had seven black coffees

08:05.043 --> 08:06.963
and I feel like
I'm really nailing it.

08:06.964 --> 08:09.482
Mark, you're in caps.

08:09.483 --> 08:11.963
It looks like you've been in caps
for a few hours.

08:11.964 --> 08:14.762
Caps still count! I've just drawn
an irresistible comparison

08:14.763 --> 08:17.082
between Mentuhotep V and Branson.

08:17.083 --> 08:19.842
I'm thinking of drawing Branson
as a hieroglyph. What do you think?

08:19.843 --> 08:23.802
I think maybe you should get
quite a lot of sleep.

08:23.803 --> 08:26.362
I just need to hit a thousand more
words, then a spell-check,

08:26.363 --> 08:27.842
then I'm done.

08:27.843 --> 08:30.882
- Ah, don't worry about
the spell-check, dude.
- You don't think?

08:30.883 --> 08:33.522
No. They'll have a big spellchecker
with all the latest words.

08:33.523 --> 08:35.082
That's what publishers are

08:35.082 --> 08:37.802
these days - spellcheckers
who take you out for lunch.

08:37.803 --> 08:40.802
'Yeah, keep killing those ants,
Charles Dickens.

08:40.803 --> 08:42.163
'Private meeting with the tutor!

08:42.164 --> 08:44.322
'Leave the life buses
at the bus stop...

08:44.323 --> 08:45.762
'I'm getting the coach!'

08:45.763 --> 08:48.242
Great morning.
You're an amazing therapist.

08:48.243 --> 08:51.082
Thanks, Jez. But I'm a life coach,
not a therapist.

08:51.083 --> 08:53.242
Yeah. Right. Exactly.

08:53.243 --> 08:56.162
Who can be bothered to get a degree
and spend four years moaning on

08:56.163 --> 08:59.042
about how your gran sent you to
primary school with raw chicken

08:59.043 --> 09:01.762
in your packed lunch, because
she'd mixed up the Tupperware boxes

09:01.763 --> 09:03.721
and you thought
she was trying to poison you?

09:03.722 --> 09:04.523
Did that happen to you?

09:04.524 --> 09:07.322
Er, yeah, yeah, it did, actually.
We laughed about it.

09:07.323 --> 09:09.322
'Mixing up the boxes?
Yeah, right!

09:09.323 --> 09:11.722
'I know you were trying
to kill me, Gran.'

09:11.723 --> 09:13.601
So, er, any idea
what you're gonna have?

09:13.602 --> 09:15.883
You need to check with me
before you make your decision?

09:15.884 --> 09:18.962
Just... curious. I was thinking
about having the burger?

09:18.963 --> 09:20.683
Why do you say that like a question?

09:20.684 --> 09:22.162
I-I don't know.

09:22.163 --> 09:24.402
Well, if you want the burger,
order the burger.

09:24.403 --> 09:26.043
I mean, I was gonna
order the burger,

09:26.044 --> 09:28.962
but now I feel like you've got a
problem with me ordering the burger?

09:28.963 --> 09:30.403
And what makes you feel that way?

09:30.404 --> 09:33.402
Because we're talking quite a lot
about me ordering the burger?

09:33.403 --> 09:35.082
You guys ready to order?

09:35.083 --> 09:36.322
Er... yeah.

09:36.323 --> 09:38.522
I think I'll have the...

09:38.523 --> 09:39.681
halloumi salad?

09:39.682 --> 09:40.963
Anything to drink?

09:40.964 --> 09:42.762
Water...?

09:42.763 --> 09:46.242
'Salad and a water?!
I'm ordering myself a horrible lunch

09:46.243 --> 09:48.762
'and somehow also
totally getting everything wrong.'

09:48.763 --> 09:50.162
And for you?

09:50.163 --> 09:52.603
Actually, you know what? Fuck it.
I'll have a Coke. Man Coke,

09:52.604 --> 09:54.603
not any Wayne Rooney,
hair-transplant bullshit.

09:54.604 --> 09:57.802
And screw the salad - I'll have a
burger. And a chocolate cheesecake.

09:57.803 --> 10:00.682
Yeah, that's right, I'm ordering
pudding before I've even started

10:00.683 --> 10:03.942
my main course. If you've got
a problem, send out the manager.

10:03.999 --> 10:05.838
Good! I'll have the same.

10:05.839 --> 10:08.199
I know what I want.
And I'm not afraid to ask for it.

10:08.200 --> 10:10.518
Look, I'm just gonna say this.

10:10.519 --> 10:12.078
I love you, Celia.

10:12.079 --> 10:14.518
'So great for a first date!

10:14.519 --> 10:16.279
'Stone-cold classic.'

10:17.719 --> 10:21.598
'Afternoon delight,
nailing the course and the tutor!'

10:21.624 --> 10:24.000
- I'm the boss.
- You're the boss.

10:24.001 --> 10:25.721
And I've got a fucking grass skirt.

10:25.722 --> 10:28.280
Oh, yes, you've got a grass skirt.

10:28.281 --> 10:30.720
A grass skirt made of dicks.

10:30.943 --> 10:32.462
Mm-hm...

10:32.463 --> 10:33.863
I've cut all the dicks off...

10:35.143 --> 10:37.742
..and they're hanging
from my skirt.

10:37.743 --> 10:39.502
Does that make you hard, Jeremy?

10:39.503 --> 10:40.862
Oh, yeah...

10:40.863 --> 10:42.582
Just... go for it, Jeremy.

10:42.583 --> 10:43.303
I'm sorry?

10:43.304 --> 10:44.822
Just go for it.

10:44.823 --> 10:46.582
Right...

10:46.583 --> 10:47.942
I-I am going for it?

10:47.943 --> 10:50.222
Oh. Fine.

10:50.223 --> 10:52.503
S-Sorry, it's just...
by telling me to go for it,

10:52.504 --> 10:55.502
it felt like you were saying
I'm not going for it.

10:55.503 --> 10:57.782
No. No, I was just checking.

10:57.783 --> 11:00.382
Right. And the severed dicks?

11:00.383 --> 11:03.502
Th... The skirt made of...?
What is that?

11:03.503 --> 11:06.782
I was in the moment, Jez!

11:06.783 --> 11:08.222
God!

11:08.223 --> 11:10.582
Sorry if I broke a taboo.

11:10.583 --> 11:12.383
Who wants boundaries in the bedroom?

11:12.384 --> 11:14.022
Now...

11:14.023 --> 11:16.702
you tell me your fantasy.

11:16.703 --> 11:20.142
'OK. My fantasy. What is my fantasy?
It's basically just humping.

11:20.143 --> 11:23.783
'I love humping.
But need something more edgy.'

11:26.023 --> 11:27.943
Sorry about the last-minute venue
change.

11:27.944 --> 11:29.943
Just, er... on my way
to the Frankfurt Book Fair.

11:29.944 --> 11:33.142
No problem. You're a busy guy
with a lot of irons in the fire.

11:33.143 --> 11:35.102
Tch! Yeah. Exactly.

11:35.103 --> 11:37.782
'This must be the greatest quantity
of squeezable mustard

11:37.783 --> 11:39.423
'ever present at a literary lunch.'

11:39.424 --> 11:43.142
Anyway, just wanted to catch you
to say how much I loved your book.

11:43.143 --> 11:44.223
Oh, wow! Thank you!

11:44.224 --> 11:46.142
Cos I hurried finishing it,

11:46.143 --> 11:47.663
I was worried I overdid
Chapter Three.

11:47.685 --> 11:48.382
No.

11:48.468 --> 11:49.469
It's not too obvious,

11:49.470 --> 11:52.108
the parallel between the Nubians
and the Assyrians,

11:52.109 --> 11:55.468
and a modern business's enemies,
web competitors and Chinese imports?

11:55.469 --> 11:57.748
Actually, my favourite chapter.

11:57.749 --> 11:59.027
God, that is so great to hear!

11:59.028 --> 12:01.467
Cos it's initially compelling,
but I was worried...

12:01.468 --> 12:03.389
No, don't worry about the book.
Book's...

12:03.390 --> 12:04.948
book's great.

12:04.949 --> 12:08.388
Thing is, we've actually just had
some bad news from Denmark.

12:08.389 --> 12:11.868
Hamlet's back, and he's made
his final decision to be?

12:11.869 --> 12:14.388
'God, I'm such an oaf!
In publishing, he must have heard

12:14.389 --> 12:16.028
'a million Hamlet jokes.'

12:16.029 --> 12:19.188
It's where we get our books printed.
And in the last week,

12:19.189 --> 12:21.468
the paper costs have just
skyrocketed.

12:21.469 --> 12:22.868
It's the euro.

12:22.869 --> 12:24.748
Oh, of course. The euro!

12:24.749 --> 12:27.468
The bloody euro
getting it wrong again.

12:27.469 --> 12:28.828
It's hitting everyone.

12:28.829 --> 12:31.748
The upshot is we're having to ask
all our authors to put in 2K

12:31.749 --> 12:33.388
just to cover the extra costs.

12:33.389 --> 12:35.108
Oh... right.

12:35.109 --> 12:36.868
It's unavoidable, unfortunately.

12:36.869 --> 12:39.788
I mean, Rushdie is pissing blood
over at Jonathan Cape, apparently.

12:39.789 --> 12:42.948
But... big picture - the book is
going to be such a monster hit,

12:42.949 --> 12:44.109
there's no downside.

12:44.110 --> 12:45.588
Oh, there's no downside?

12:45.589 --> 12:48.188
No. In fact, I am so confident,
I am prepared to cut you

12:48.189 --> 12:52.028
an extra percentage point on books
sold over a quarter of a million.

12:52.029 --> 12:53.948
Oh, wow! That... that's great!

12:53.949 --> 12:55.389
'Mm. Don't act too pleased.

12:55.390 --> 12:56.748
'Remember Johnson.

12:56.749 --> 12:59.308
'"Keep your panties dry
till the big guy's hard."'

12:59.309 --> 13:00.468
Tell you what,

13:00.469 --> 13:04.949
Greg, why don't we go 50/50 on
net profits over a million units?

13:05.949 --> 13:07.028
Oh!

13:07.029 --> 13:09.308
Yeah, I forgot I was talking
to a business guru.

13:09.309 --> 13:11.468
What the hell.

13:11.469 --> 13:12.949
Nice doing business with you.

13:12.950 --> 13:14.869
'I'm killing these guys!'

13:15.952 --> 13:17.272
Greg really liked the draft.

13:17.273 --> 13:19.911
He had no notes at all,
which was pretty sweet.

13:19.912 --> 13:23.151
He was even fine about me
missing the deadline.

13:23.152 --> 13:25.632
Right... But how much
are they paying you upfront?

13:25.633 --> 13:29.791
Publishing isn't an
upfront situation these days.

13:29.792 --> 13:31.832
You've got to put in seed money
for the first run.

13:31.833 --> 13:33.671
They're asking you to pay?

13:33.672 --> 13:36.631
It's a totally standard deal
for first-time authors.

13:36.632 --> 13:40.952
But the poor guys, I'm absolutely
killing them on the big-unit deals.

13:42.472 --> 13:46.791
Does JK Rowling pay to have
Harry Potter books published?

13:46.792 --> 13:50.271
That's different. Harry Potter books
are about wizards, for children.

13:50.272 --> 13:53.951
My book is about pharaohs,
for adults.

13:53.952 --> 13:56.031
Right. OK...

13:56.032 --> 13:57.791
In fact, it was the unluckiest day

13:57.792 --> 14:01.071
of JK Rowling's life when she got
picked up by a publishing house.

14:01.072 --> 14:02.272
Greg from British London

14:02.273 --> 14:05.071
was saying, imagine
if she'd self-published!

14:05.072 --> 14:08.551
"British London"?
Doesn't that sound a bit...

14:08.552 --> 14:10.032
Too patriotic for your liking?

14:10.033 --> 14:11.431
..made up?

14:11.432 --> 14:15.271
So what if it's made up? Do you think
Penguin was founded by a penguin?

14:15.272 --> 14:17.271
In a sense, everything's made up.

14:17.272 --> 14:19.951
I don't like the way these
percentiles are looking at me.

14:19.952 --> 14:21.512
Right, well, thanks for that, Hans,

14:21.513 --> 14:24.151
but I really wouldn't worry.
It's a gentleman's agreement.

14:24.152 --> 14:26.991
Well, it looks like you've agreed
these gentlemen can arse-fuck you.

14:26.992 --> 14:28.271
Just, erm...

14:28.272 --> 14:29.791
be careful. OK, mate?

14:29.792 --> 14:31.192
'Jeremy is the voice of reason,

14:31.193 --> 14:33.791
'and Super Hans is giving me
legal advice.

14:33.792 --> 14:35.312
'Doesn't feel great.'

14:36.792 --> 14:39.391
I went to see Trish and Simon
and everyone in the new office.

14:39.392 --> 14:42.671
'Tch! No doubt their office
is a converted warehouse

14:42.672 --> 14:45.351
'full of smoothie makers
and basketball hoops

14:45.352 --> 14:47.031
'and rim jobs.'

14:47.032 --> 14:49.071
I was like, "Fuck it. Why not?"

14:49.072 --> 14:51.272
So I handed in my notice
at the council yesterday!

14:51.273 --> 14:54.031
Oh... Wow, that's...

14:54.032 --> 14:55.031
amazing.

14:55.032 --> 14:56.152
I know!

15:00.472 --> 15:01.752
Jeremy, you've failed.

15:01.753 --> 15:03.752
She's done exactly what she wanted.

15:03.753 --> 15:05.711
I tried, but it's difficult.

15:05.712 --> 15:08.070
Spirit crushing comes
much more naturally to you.

15:08.071 --> 15:09.272
This won't work.

15:09.273 --> 15:12.351
You should have told her the truth.
Dreams crumble to dust.

15:12.352 --> 15:14.792
Your motto. You should put that
on your business cards.

15:14.793 --> 15:18.831
Anyway, chill out.
If you love something, set it free.

15:18.832 --> 15:21.551
What if I love a black mamba?
Should I set that free?

15:21.552 --> 15:23.431
Is that what you and Sting want,

15:23.432 --> 15:25.792
a venomous killer loose
on the streets of south London?

15:28.152 --> 15:31.031
So, thinking about the book launch...

15:31.032 --> 15:32.832
cash bar, but I might provide nuts.

15:32.833 --> 15:35.391
Salted or dry roasted, though?

15:35.392 --> 15:37.631
Salted are classic -
everyone loves salt...

15:37.632 --> 15:40.072
but expensive in the quantities
I want to provide.

15:40.073 --> 15:41.271
It's tricky.

15:41.272 --> 15:42.791
Aren't London British paying?

15:42.792 --> 15:45.111
British London.
No, not in the current climate.

15:45.112 --> 15:48.471
OK, time to hit go,
make the transfer,

15:48.472 --> 15:51.271
let BL fire up the printing press.

15:51.272 --> 15:55.231
Mark?! Ј2,000?

15:55.232 --> 15:57.751
The situation in Denmark
is deteriorating. That's a fact.

15:57.752 --> 16:00.831
Ink shortage. But if I move quickly,
BL might be able to get me some.

16:00.832 --> 16:02.112
They have a guy in Hamburg.

16:02.113 --> 16:05.071
'Oh, my God, he's actually
going through with it.

16:05.072 --> 16:07.271
'He's cracking his nest egg
and frying it up

16:07.272 --> 16:09.671
'to make these arseholes
a delicious breakfast.'

16:09.672 --> 16:10.831
Hey!

16:10.832 --> 16:12.351
Mark, I can't let you do this.

16:12.352 --> 16:14.471
Return my mouse, Jeremy.
That's my property.

16:14.472 --> 16:16.831
You're censoring me.
I'm calling Amnesty.

16:16.832 --> 16:19.031
Go ahead.
I'm sure they'll be fascinated,

16:19.032 --> 16:22.111
but the mouse is staying with me.
I'm doing an intervention on you.

16:22.112 --> 16:25.431
All you're doing is preventing
an important work of world literature

16:25.432 --> 16:26.470
from going to press.

16:26.471 --> 16:28.872
Why don't you "intervene"
on Ian McEwan or Tony Parsons?

16:30.272 --> 16:33.071
I'm going to say two words
that you don't want to hear.

16:33.072 --> 16:34.152
"Vanity publishing."

16:35.192 --> 16:37.711
You're just jealous
because I'm a successful author

16:37.712 --> 16:39.751
and you're an unemployed dope smoker

16:39.752 --> 16:43.831
who, even after 20 years of doing it,
still can't roll very good joints.

16:43.832 --> 16:46.471
I just think you need to be
realistic about your targets,

16:46.472 --> 16:47.672
aims and expectations.

16:47.673 --> 16:49.911
Are you trying to life-coach me?!

16:49.912 --> 16:51.351
Maybe.

16:51.352 --> 16:54.031
I'm the one who should be doing
an intervention - on you,

16:54.032 --> 16:57.831
because, my friend,
you are a vanity life coach.

16:57.832 --> 16:59.831
My course is a proper
qualification...

16:59.832 --> 17:02.272
it's not a pretend book
from a pretend publisher's

17:02.273 --> 17:04.471
getting printed on pretend paper.

17:04.472 --> 17:07.191
Yeah, well, even if you complete
your ludicrously short course,

17:07.192 --> 17:08.912
you're never going to be
a life coach.

17:08.913 --> 17:10.751
It's just another dream,

17:10.752 --> 17:13.711
like being a pop star
or a front bottom inspector.

17:13.712 --> 17:16.471
That wasn't a career,
that was a T-shirt!

17:16.472 --> 17:18.192
Yeah, well, a front bottom inspector

17:18.193 --> 17:21.751
is still a more realistic career
option for you than life coach.

17:21.752 --> 17:24.471
I threw that T-shirt out months ago.
You know why?

17:24.472 --> 17:26.191
Because it was tasteless.

17:26.192 --> 17:28.391
I was embarrassed to wear it
in public.

17:28.392 --> 17:30.352
That's the Jeremy
you're dealing with now.

17:30.353 --> 17:32.831
That's how much I've grown
as an individual.

17:32.832 --> 17:34.911
Hey, Jeremy, do you want
to life-coach this

17:34.912 --> 17:36.350
into the washing-up bowl?

17:36.351 --> 17:38.192
'You're not stopping my book launch.

17:38.193 --> 17:41.792
'Kneel before Pharaoh Corrigan
and his pyramid of peanuts.'

17:43.272 --> 17:44.911
So, er, listen,

17:44.912 --> 17:47.031
what the hell's going on?

17:47.032 --> 17:48.272
How do you mean?

17:48.273 --> 17:50.191
Everyone. Everyone passed.

17:50.192 --> 17:52.911
Is it some sort of
administrative error?

17:52.912 --> 17:55.471
I mean, Hillary,
whose UKIP membership card

17:55.472 --> 17:56.552
fell out of her purse?

17:56.553 --> 17:59.191
Are you really suggesting people
go to her to get coaching?

17:59.192 --> 18:02.031
Is my certificate different?
Is it better?

18:02.032 --> 18:03.751
You don't have a certificate.

18:03.752 --> 18:05.391
What do I get? A couch?

18:05.392 --> 18:06.471
Or... a conch?

18:06.472 --> 18:07.911
Or a cr...

18:07.912 --> 18:09.831
Not a crown. That would be... odd.

18:09.832 --> 18:12.831
I can't put my reputation
on the line by certifying you

18:12.832 --> 18:14.112
as a life coach.

18:14.113 --> 18:15.551
What?

18:15.552 --> 18:18.511
You have a poorly developed
ego system and sexual issues.

18:18.512 --> 18:19.631
Oh, yeah?

18:19.632 --> 18:22.471
OK, well, let me give you
a little tip about foreplay.

18:22.472 --> 18:24.471
You were waggling around on my guy

18:24.472 --> 18:27.471
like it was the cranking handle
on Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.

18:27.472 --> 18:29.191
You're a sexual pervert, Jeremy.

18:29.192 --> 18:30.992
You mean in a bad way?

18:31.992 --> 18:33.831
Cos of what I said?

18:33.832 --> 18:35.191
Yes. It was disgusting.

18:35.192 --> 18:38.311
Oh, Mrs Severed Cocks
thinks I'm disgusting?

18:38.312 --> 18:40.911
Cut all my hair off and eat it?

18:40.912 --> 18:42.831
I was busking. I was vibing.

18:42.832 --> 18:44.192
You were cutting things off.

18:44.193 --> 18:46.831
I thought hair.
I mean, it's not cocks.

18:46.832 --> 18:48.751
That was just a mad image,

18:48.752 --> 18:51.911
whereas destroying and consuming
my beautiful hair...

18:51.912 --> 18:54.111
I thought there were no boundaries.

18:54.112 --> 18:56.391
There are no boundaries.
Within limits.

18:56.392 --> 18:59.031
Limits. Right. Well, I'm appealing.

18:59.032 --> 19:03.031
I'm gonna launch an appeal to the...
British Life Coaching Confederation.

19:03.032 --> 19:04.671
And if such a body exists,

19:04.672 --> 19:07.031
then you're gonna be in big,
big trouble.

19:07.032 --> 19:08.312
Hm!

19:09.752 --> 19:11.471
Hey, Mark.

19:11.472 --> 19:12.472
How's it, er...?

19:12.473 --> 19:14.031
Oh, er...

19:14.032 --> 19:16.551
Good. Yeah, great.

19:16.552 --> 19:19.471
A few errata.
Always going to be a few errata.

19:19.472 --> 19:21.031
Yeah, yeah, always.

19:21.032 --> 19:23.591
Er, it's gonna be a good night,
I reckon.

19:23.592 --> 19:24.832
Yeah. So, Jez, listen,

19:24.833 --> 19:28.671
I'm just going to go home
out the fire escape or the window.

19:28.672 --> 19:31.471
But would you ask the pub man
if I can have my deposit back?

19:31.472 --> 19:34.391
And would you tell everyone I've
made a horrible mistake? Goodbye.

19:34.392 --> 19:35.471
Mark?

19:35.472 --> 19:37.792
They misspelt my name, Jeremy.

19:40.472 --> 19:42.232
Mark Crorigan.

19:43.272 --> 19:44.911
But hey, it looks good, man.

19:44.912 --> 19:46.752
I mean, some of it's difficult
to read,

19:46.753 --> 19:50.271
cos the text kind of disappears
into the binding, but...

19:50.272 --> 19:53.751
They're print-outs, Jeremy,
they're not books.

19:53.752 --> 19:54.952
They're just print-outs.

19:54.953 --> 19:58.911
'Every fibre of my being wants
to scream, "I told you so."

19:58.912 --> 20:00.951
'But I'm a life coach now. Sort of.'

20:00.952 --> 20:03.391
Greg said he really liked
Chapter Fourteen,

20:03.392 --> 20:06.191
the Nile irrigation/viral marketing
comparison.

20:06.192 --> 20:07.751
Why would he leave that out?

20:07.752 --> 20:08.912
I don't know, Mark.

20:08.913 --> 20:11.111
Maybe it's just one of those things.

20:11.112 --> 20:14.471
One of those things where a cherished
dream is smashed into your face

20:14.472 --> 20:17.471
and you're humiliated
in front of everyone you know?

20:17.472 --> 20:18.952
Hi, Pam...

20:20.272 --> 20:22.671
Exactly, one of those things.

20:22.672 --> 20:25.471
Why don't you do a reading
from your book?

20:25.472 --> 20:27.752
Oh, no, I don't think
people would really want to...

20:27.753 --> 20:29.391
Oh, go on, please!

20:29.392 --> 20:32.191
Do it in your Egyptian accent,
like you did in bed the other night.

20:32.192 --> 20:33.230
That was so funny.

20:33.231 --> 20:34.310
I really don't...

20:34.311 --> 20:35.232
You can do it, mate.

20:37.472 --> 20:38.672
Hi.

20:39.832 --> 20:41.551
Hi, everyone. Thanks...

20:41.552 --> 20:43.591
thanks for coming. Erm...

20:43.592 --> 20:46.271
I-I just wanted to say...

20:46.272 --> 20:49.031
vanity, all is vanity.

20:49.032 --> 20:52.591
Like Pharaoh Khufu,
I have built a great tomb.

20:52.592 --> 20:56.031
But tonight I'm not going
to bury you in it with me.

20:56.032 --> 20:58.231
Er, except with
the admittedly generous

20:58.232 --> 21:01.511
mounds of peanuts
that you'll see I've provided.

21:01.512 --> 21:06.231
No, tonight, I just want to say
that this book...

21:06.232 --> 21:07.551
is a disaster.

21:07.552 --> 21:09.831
It's a travesty.

21:09.832 --> 21:11.031
It's proof...

21:11.032 --> 21:12.831
of a broken promise.

21:12.832 --> 21:15.191
But I want to announce here

21:15.192 --> 21:18.071
that I will be aggressively
pursuing British London

21:18.072 --> 21:19.552
in the small claims court,

21:19.553 --> 21:23.351
therefore proving the wisdom
of my seventh chapter,

21:23.352 --> 21:27.311
Make UK Company Law Into Your Anubis.

21:27.312 --> 21:30.671
Or, as the BL spell-check
has rendered it,

21:30.672 --> 21:35.072
Make UK Company Law Your Omnibus.

21:38.112 --> 21:40.271
It was OK, wasn't it?

21:40.272 --> 21:43.551
It was a weird and uplifting night
of recriminations

21:43.552 --> 21:46.031
and complicated legal debate.

21:46.032 --> 21:47.871
And, Jeremy, I wanted to apologise

21:47.872 --> 21:50.271
for saying your life coaching
was bullshit.

21:50.272 --> 21:53.191
Water under the bridge,
as Simon & Garfunkel used to sing.

21:53.192 --> 21:56.111
'Not even going to correct him.
That's how big I've become.

21:56.112 --> 21:58.751
'I'm enormous, like the sun god Ra.'

21:58.752 --> 22:02.391
OK. Wow. Right. This must be
the only publishing house

22:02.392 --> 22:04.671
that looks like it could also
do you an MoT.

22:04.672 --> 22:06.432
I wanted to give you something, mate.

22:07.192 --> 22:08.591
Greg?

22:08.592 --> 22:09.672
Mm.

22:10.912 --> 22:13.912
Here we are, hot off the presses.

22:17.752 --> 22:19.311
Oh, my God!

22:19.312 --> 22:21.551
Usbourne with a U and everything!

22:21.552 --> 22:23.591
You got my name right, Mark!

22:23.592 --> 22:24.672
I also do business cards.

22:24.673 --> 22:28.391
You may have failed the course,
but you can be a life coach anyway.

22:28.392 --> 22:29.512
This is amazing.

22:29.513 --> 22:32.031
Ooh, stars!
Four stars! What are the stars for?

22:32.032 --> 22:34.151
Well, I just thought
you deserved some stars.

22:34.152 --> 22:35.751
Only four, though?

22:35.752 --> 22:38.391
I thought about doing five,
but I didn't want to push it.

22:38.392 --> 22:39.232
Fair do's.

22:39.233 --> 22:41.111
But I did put "Grade - excellent",

22:41.112 --> 22:43.191
cos I think you'll make
an excellent life coach.

22:43.192 --> 22:45.031
Thank you, Mark.

22:45.032 --> 22:47.111
God, look at it!

22:47.112 --> 22:49.751
Approved by the British Life
Coaching Confederation. Fancy!

22:49.752 --> 22:52.031
And the great thing is
that the genuine document

22:52.032 --> 22:54.551
is so worthless that there's
very little chance of the forgery

22:54.552 --> 22:55.592
being detected.

22:55.593 --> 22:57.951
No-one will ever know!
I can't be found out!

22:57.952 --> 22:59.152
See you in court, Greg.

22:59.153 --> 23:00.751
Look, Mark,

23:00.752 --> 23:03.471
I know this place isn't great.
I'm in-between offices.

23:03.472 --> 23:06.671
But BL is for real,
and I really did love your book,

23:06.672 --> 23:08.112
and you're a great writer.

23:08.113 --> 23:10.591
Yeah, pull the other one,
it's got bells on.

23:10.592 --> 23:13.511
You're a talent, Mark.
I'm building a list.

23:13.512 --> 23:16.151
I've been speaking to
Jeanette Winterson. Apparently,

23:16.152 --> 23:17.671
she's not happy over at Vintage.

23:17.672 --> 23:19.792
I want to publish your next book.
What's it about?

23:19.793 --> 23:23.031
Well, not that it's any of your
beeswax, but I was thinking about

23:23.032 --> 23:25.271
doing something on Napoleon
and the internet.

23:25.272 --> 23:26.951
Now, that sounds amazing.

23:26.952 --> 23:29.791
How about that and a second run
of BS Of The Ps,

23:29.792 --> 23:31.670
correct the errata,
no upfront payment.

23:31.671 --> 23:33.430
You would just put in
a small bridging loan.

23:33.431 --> 23:34.232
Come on!

23:34.233 --> 23:36.791
What do you think, Jez?
He couldn't do it twice.

23:36.792 --> 23:38.911
No, that would be impossible!

23:38.912 --> 23:41.352
Come on, mate,
I'm life-coaching you out of here.

23:44.032 --> 23:52.939
