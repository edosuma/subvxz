Krusty's sponsor, the Texxon
family of gas stations,

00:56.290 --> 00:59.091
wants you to know
that today's the last day

00:59.093 --> 01:02.694
of their "Happy Little Elves"

Maggie, you can't

Trebek answer some questions.

01:28.189 --> 01:29.688
Dad, I think
Maggie's just sad

01:29.690 --> 01:32.825
'cause her set is missing
"Baby Must-Have."

01:40.401 --> 01:42.434
Didn't there used
to be more Texxon stations?

01:42.436 --> 01:47.339
Yes, but they sold a bunch off
to that frozen yogurt chain.

I'm not cheap, baby, I'm
embarrassed to be seen with you.

01:55.850 --> 01:58.183
Big difference.
Hmm...

02:01.288 --> 02:02.421

02:02.423 --> 02:04.323
Hmm. Nice part of
town you got here.

02:04.325 --> 02:06.725
Too bad you keep
it so far away.

02:06.727 --> 02:07.459
(laughing)

02:07.461 --> 02:10.596
Now that we're best friends,
can I get the baby elf?

02:10.598 --> 02:11.296
Pick a box.

02:11.298 --> 02:12.431
You get what you get.

02:12.433 --> 02:13.832
You can't tell
what's inside!

02:13.834 --> 02:17.369
Oh, of all the times not
to have x-ray vision.

02:17.371 --> 02:20.806
Mm... I'll take that one.

02:23.611 --> 02:25.010
Hmm?

02:25.312 --> 02:28.413
This isn't the right one.
She wants the baby.

02:28.415 --> 02:29.815
I can't give you another toy

02:29.817 --> 02:32.551
till you buy another
ten gallons of gas.

02:32.553 --> 02:34.987
You're lucky you're
behind glass.

02:34.989 --> 02:37.156
Ain't no glass. (groans)

02:37.158 --> 02:39.024
Sure, it's easy
to slap people

02:39.026 --> 02:41.126
when you're hiding
behind that glass!

02:41.128 --> 02:41.693
(grunts)

02:41.695 --> 02:42.794
You have a good day.

02:42.796 --> 02:45.764

02:45.766 --> 02:47.266
Ain't no glass.

02:47.268 --> 02:47.900
I'll show them.

02:47.902 --> 02:51.670
I'll buy ten more gallons

Oh, I'm sorry, Maggie,
but even at your age,

I'm sure you understand
things can't always go your way,

03:49.330 --> 03:54.600
and that's why I can't believe
we didn't get that stupid elf!

like these before.

04:03.444 --> 04:06.044

I know where we are!

04:06.046 --> 04:08.580
This is the neighborhood
where I grew up!

04:08.582 --> 04:10.782
Ooh, everything's changed.

04:10.784 --> 04:12.918
That tree used to be
a smaller tree.

04:12.920 --> 04:16.855
And that food bank used
to be a regular bank.

04:16.857 --> 04:18.924
The march of progress.

04:18.926 --> 04:21.593

There's my old house!

04:21.595 --> 04:22.961
(tires squeal, sighs)

04:22.963 --> 04:25.664
Someday when I'm a grownup,
maybe I'll go back

04:25.666 --> 04:26.798
and look fondly
at our house.

04:26.800 --> 04:30.002
Well, stop in and say "hi" to me
'cause I'll still be there,

04:30.004 --> 04:32.571
chillin' in my
basement bachelor pad.

04:32.573 --> 04:35.874
Be sure to water the flowers
on my backyard grave.

04:35.876 --> 04:36.808
As long as I can dig you up

04:36.810 --> 04:38.777
and stick you on the front porch
every Halloween.

04:38.779 --> 04:41.680
Just don't dress me up
like a woman.
We'll see.

04:41.682 --> 04:42.981
(tapping)
(all gasp)

04:42.983 --> 04:46.018
I know what you folks
are here for.

04:46.020 --> 04:46.718
Rabbits!

04:46.720 --> 04:49.321
I just kilt this one
because it stopped bein' cute!

04:49.323 --> 04:50.889
We're not here
for rabbit.

04:50.891 --> 04:53.792
I used to live in
this house as a girl.

04:53.794 --> 04:55.360
I live in it now as a woman.

04:55.362 --> 04:57.062
Hey, you wanna come on in?
Take a look around?

04:57.064 --> 04:59.865
Oh, I'd love to,
if it's not an imposition.

04:59.867 --> 05:03.168
Well, as long as we don't
have to feed this one.

05:03.170 --> 05:05.337
(woman and Homer laugh)

05:05.339 --> 05:07.039
Tell her "no deal."

05:07.574 --> 05:10.776
Everything's just
the way I remember it.

05:10.778 --> 05:11.610
You see that mirror?

05:11.612 --> 05:13.879
I discovered that if I sat
in the kitchen,

05:13.881 --> 05:15.547
I could see
if the bathroom was free

05:15.549 --> 05:19.051
using the reflection
from the mirror off the toaster.

05:19.053 --> 05:22.654
(humming happy tune)

05:22.656 --> 05:25.057
(groans in disgust)

05:25.059 --> 05:26.692

05:26.694 --> 05:28.427

My bedpost smooshes

05:28.429 --> 05:30.095
are still in the carpet!

05:30.097 --> 05:30.796
(laughs)

05:30.798 --> 05:32.097
I want to go read books
in the car.

05:32.099 --> 05:33.932
There are no books
in the car.

05:33.934 --> 05:36.301
I just want to
sit in the car!

05:36.470 --> 05:38.737
I always wondered
who "Marge" is.

05:38.739 --> 05:41.440
(gasps)
My memorables!

05:41.442 --> 05:43.542
Over the years, I've
sure been tempted

05:43.544 --> 05:45.010
to go through
this stuff.

05:45.012 --> 05:46.945
So I did, many times.

05:46.947 --> 05:48.080
(clattering noise in room)

05:48.082 --> 05:51.350
My whole childhood
is in this box.

05:51.352 --> 05:52.951
My scrunchies.

05:52.953 --> 05:56.722
I never really had
the hair for these.

05:56.724 --> 05:57.656
Wow, Mom.

05:57.658 --> 06:00.425
You got first place
in the science fair.

06:00.427 --> 06:01.727
Oh, that's
ancient history.

06:01.729 --> 06:05.664
Ooh, here's my paper
on ancient history.

06:06.100 --> 06:09.434
Mom, these grades are amazing.

06:09.436 --> 06:10.802
Just as good as mine.

06:10.804 --> 06:14.072
LISA:
But then you wound up like you.

06:20.848 --> 06:22.481

Oh, man.

06:22.483 --> 06:24.783
The drainage
around here is a joke.

06:24.785 --> 06:27.052
I don't even know
why I pay taxes.

06:27.054 --> 06:28.620

Buying those extra trophies
from cash-strapped schools

07:19.640 --> 07:20.939
really filled out the old case.

07:20.941 --> 07:22.908
Principal Skinner?
Quick question.

07:22.910 --> 07:25.143
Is it true my mom
was a great student?

07:25.145 --> 07:28.647
Oh, indeed. Your mother was
as fine a student as you.

07:28.649 --> 07:29.448
Keep up the good work,

07:29.450 --> 07:32.451
and you'll probably
wind up just like her.

07:32.453 --> 07:33.618
Well...

07:33.620 --> 07:35.620
Of course that would be great.

07:35.622 --> 07:39.524
But I see myself making
an impact outside the home.

07:39.526 --> 07:42.260
(chuckles)
Lisa, one of the
hardest jobs I have

07:42.262 --> 07:45.197
is throwing cold water on
young children's dreams.

07:45.199 --> 07:47.098
Ralph, you're not a kangaroo.

07:47.100 --> 07:48.166
(groans of disappointment)

07:48.168 --> 07:51.169
The point is, I've learned
a lot about human nature

07:51.171 --> 07:52.871
by sitting in the
park with Mother.

07:52.873 --> 07:54.039
And one thing I've learned

07:54.041 --> 07:56.942
is children turn out
like their parents.

07:56.944 --> 08:00.011
Behold, your future.

08:00.848 --> 08:02.914
(sadly):
Oh...

08:03.150 --> 08:06.184
Ralph, you're also
not a trophy.

08:06.186 --> 08:08.053
(groans sadly)

08:08.055 --> 08:08.720
Skinner!

08:08.722 --> 08:11.690
I warned you about
interacting with students.

08:11.692 --> 08:13.258
I don't want to have
to yell at you!

08:13.260 --> 08:14.860
You yell at me
about everything.

08:14.862 --> 08:16.127
Well I can't yell
at anyone else!

08:16.129 --> 08:19.164
Teachers have a union.
Students have parents.

08:19.166 --> 08:22.234
What about Willie?
I like Willie!

08:25.672 --> 08:27.539
Maggie, something
happened to Mom,

08:27.541 --> 08:29.241
and I'm gonna find out
what and when.

08:29.243 --> 08:31.910
Mom's looking good through
elementary school.

08:31.912 --> 08:35.580
Ninth grade, tenth grade,
still riding the A-Train.

08:35.582 --> 08:39.584
Then suddenly, when she was
a high school senior...

08:39.586 --> 08:40.452
Blam!

08:40.454 --> 08:42.821
MARGE:
You kids play nice up there!

08:42.823 --> 08:45.257
What could have happened?

08:48.262 --> 08:50.862
(ominous music plays)

08:59.606 --> 09:02.807
(Homer humming happy tune)

09:05.078 --> 09:05.944
Dad?
Hmm?

09:05.946 --> 09:07.178
Can I talk to
you for a second?

09:07.180 --> 09:09.281
What is troubling you,
my son?

09:09.283 --> 09:11.583
I mean, my girl son?

09:11.585 --> 09:15.086
Well, um, I was looking
through Mom's old schoolwork,

09:15.088 --> 09:17.889
and I noticed her
grades went down

09:17.891 --> 09:20.025
when she started
going out with you.

09:20.027 --> 09:21.293
Hey, if it hadn't been me,

09:21.295 --> 09:23.428
it would have been
someone or something else.

09:23.430 --> 09:27.432
Sooner or later,
everyone meets their Homer.

09:29.703 --> 09:30.769
No offense, Dad,

09:30.771 --> 09:34.072
but no boy is gonna
distract me from my dreams.

09:34.074 --> 09:36.741
It may not be a boy.
It could be anything:

09:36.743 --> 09:40.312
scrapbooking, high-stakes poker,
or the Santa Fe lifestyle.

09:40.314 --> 09:43.915
Just pick a dead end
and chill out till you die.

09:43.917 --> 09:46.184
No! That's not
gonna happen to me!

09:46.186 --> 09:50.155
I'm gonna make sure
nothing distracts me ever!

09:50.157 --> 09:51.323
(whistling nonchalantly)

09:51.325 --> 09:52.824
Whoa!
Look at you,

09:52.826 --> 09:56.127
strutting around, like
you're Toad of Toad Hall.

09:56.129 --> 09:58.330
Uh, I'm just whistling, man.

09:58.332 --> 10:00.065

10:00.067 --> 10:02.734
You think you're so smart,
don't you , Simpson?

10:02.736 --> 10:04.803
We're both in
the same reading group.

10:04.805 --> 10:06.204
I think you know
how smart I am.

10:06.206 --> 10:10.175
That's an insult to me
and the rest of the inchworms.

10:12.379 --> 10:14.112
Bart did it again!

10:14.114 --> 10:14.813
I'm not a bully!

10:14.815 --> 10:18.016
It's just a series
of incredible coincidences.

10:18.018 --> 10:21.319
Well, Bart, I guess his
parking spot is yours now.

10:21.321 --> 10:22.354
Well done.

10:22.356 --> 10:23.955
(exasperated grunt)

10:23.957 --> 10:25.323
(crickets chirping)

10:25.325 --> 10:27.192
Okay, I've gotten rid

10:27.194 --> 10:29.928
of all of my distractions,
diversions,

10:29.930 --> 10:31.763
hobbies...
(gasps)

10:31.765 --> 10:32.964
Oh, my God!

10:33.166 --> 10:36.201
Are you a distraction
or a higher calling?

10:36.203 --> 10:37.035
All right, let's see.

10:37.037 --> 10:41.139
How many jazz musicians
led long and happy lives?

10:41.141 --> 10:43.375
There's, um...

10:46.980 --> 10:47.912
(sniffing)

10:47.914 --> 10:50.815
(muffled notes playing)

10:51.652 --> 10:54.986
That's odd. Lisa just threw
her saxophone out the window.

10:54.988 --> 10:57.422
Oh, that's probably
because to her,

10:57.424 --> 10:59.024
the saxophone is a me,

10:59.026 --> 11:01.393
and she doesn't want
to end up like you.

11:01.395 --> 11:02.694
Good night.

11:02.996 --> 11:04.829
She doesn't want
to end up like me?

11:04.831 --> 11:07.866
Uh, no, she does,
totally, but, uh,

11:07.868 --> 11:10.168
with a happier
ending. Good night.

11:10.170 --> 11:12.037
What's so wrong
with me?

11:12.039 --> 11:14.606
(chuckles) Nothing,
sweetie, nothing.

11:14.608 --> 11:15.840
Here, let me explain.

11:15.842 --> 11:18.043
She does not want to...

11:18.045 --> 11:20.211
turn out like... you...

11:20.213 --> 11:22.414
didn't... not until...

11:22.416 --> 11:25.083
diplomatic... trapped...

11:25.085 --> 11:25.450
help.

11:25.452 --> 11:28.086
(à la hypnotist, claps twice)
Remember nothing!

11:28.088 --> 11:30.288
I remember everything.

11:30.290 --> 11:34.292
Well, if you check your purse,
I think you'll find...

11:34.294 --> 11:37.395
the seven of clubs!

11:39.199 --> 11:39.798
No.

11:39.800 --> 11:44.402
Just a picture of Lisa--
who wants to be nothing like me.

11:44.404 --> 11:46.938
I am so sorry, Marge.

11:48.008 --> 11:49.107
Hee-hee-hee.

11:49.109 --> 11:50.442
MARGE:
Stupid pan!

11:50.444 --> 11:52.310
(frustrated grunting)

11:52.312 --> 11:54.479
Mom, could you keep
it down a little?

11:54.481 --> 11:56.781
I'm trying to study.
Uh-huh. Yeah.

11:56.783 --> 11:58.883
Here's your breakfast.

11:58.885 --> 12:01.252
Not a good time!

12:01.488 --> 12:02.954
Mom, is
something wrong?

12:02.956 --> 12:06.191
Would it be so bad
to turn out like me?!

12:06.193 --> 12:08.927
Mom, I admire everything you do.

12:08.929 --> 12:10.762
But it's not good
enough, is it?

12:10.764 --> 12:12.997
It's plenty good.
It's great!

12:12.999 --> 12:14.199
It's just...

12:14.201 --> 12:16.301
not for me.

12:17.437 --> 12:20.171
(horn honks)
School bus!

12:22.109 --> 12:24.142
(affectionately):
Mmm...

12:24.144 --> 12:25.910
(disgruntledly):
Mwa.

12:26.246 --> 12:29.447
What kind of kiss
did you get?
Normal. You?

12:29.449 --> 12:30.148
Ice-cold.

12:30.150 --> 12:32.217
You're just
imagining things.

12:32.219 --> 12:34.219
Oh, yeah?

12:34.221 --> 12:35.186
Hmm...

12:35.188 --> 12:37.455
What does your note say?

12:37.457 --> 12:39.858
The seven of clubs?

12:39.860 --> 12:41.793
Ta-dah!

12:45.832 --> 12:47.766
Ugh! What's the point
of getting rid of all

12:47.768 --> 12:51.236
the distractions at home if
I have to do my learning here?

12:51.238 --> 12:53.805
(excited shouts)

12:56.376 --> 12:57.308
(floor waxer whirring)

12:57.310 --> 12:59.978
(to tune of "Loch Lomond"):
♪ Oh, I'll wax the upstairs ♪

12:59.980 --> 13:01.513
♪ And I'll wax the downstairs ♪

13:01.515 --> 13:05.517
♪ And I'll get drunk
in the li'bry! ♪

13:05.519 --> 13:06.251
Willie!

13:06.253 --> 13:08.820
Do you have to wax
this floor now?

13:08.822 --> 13:11.022
No, no, I can
come back later.

13:11.024 --> 13:12.056
Whoa-aah! Oof!

13:12.058 --> 13:13.424
(bones crack)
(screams)

13:13.426 --> 13:15.293
Oh. Should I get the nurse?

13:15.295 --> 13:16.861
Nay, just keep studyin'.

13:16.863 --> 13:18.196
I'll scream this out.

13:18.198 --> 13:21.533
(cracking)
(screaming)

13:21.535 --> 13:22.500
(groaning in pain)

13:22.502 --> 13:24.469
(cracking)
(anguished screams)

13:24.471 --> 13:27.372
Aah!
(groaning)

13:28.508 --> 13:29.107
(yells)

13:29.109 --> 13:32.110
I can get to you
whenever I want, Simpson.

13:32.112 --> 13:33.778
But I'm gonna bide my time.

13:33.780 --> 13:36.881
You won't even hear
the punch that wastes you.

13:36.883 --> 13:40.919
And you'll crack like
one of those chicken turds

13:40.921 --> 13:42.453
rich people eat.

13:42.455 --> 13:44.155
You mean an egg?

13:44.157 --> 13:46.524
I mean you're dead!

13:46.526 --> 13:47.458
Aah!

13:47.460 --> 13:48.526
Let me out of here,

13:48.528 --> 13:50.595
so I can put you in here!

13:50.597 --> 13:53.331
Ha! You're not
so tough now.

13:53.333 --> 13:54.299
(grunts)

13:54.301 --> 13:55.867
(screaming)

13:57.103 --> 14:00.438
(lively chatter)

14:00.440 --> 14:02.774
Aw... Dad was right--

14:02.776 --> 14:04.876
I might as well give up.

14:07.914 --> 14:10.582
(classical chamber music
playing)

14:13.186 --> 14:16.421
(chamber music continues)

14:19.025 --> 14:21.092
(gasps)
Cloisters Academy?

14:21.094 --> 14:25.096
That bus could pick me up
any day of the week!

14:25.098 --> 14:25.930
'Sup, bro?

14:25.932 --> 14:28.299
I'm not your brother.

14:29.002 --> 14:32.604
Lord Buddha, I know
I'm not supposed to want stuff,

14:32.606 --> 14:35.106
but come on!

14:40.080 --> 14:43.348
Cloisters Academy is a
refuge for quiet learning.

14:43.350 --> 14:45.617
We have every
facility imaginable,

14:45.619 --> 14:48.052
including an imaginatorium.

14:48.955 --> 14:50.688
Oh, no, wait, it's over there.

14:50.690 --> 14:52.457
Mom! Dad! Please
can I go here?

14:52.459 --> 14:56.261
I'll study so hard, I'll make
the old me look like Bart!

14:56.263 --> 14:58.897
That would be one
weird-looking kid.

14:58.899 --> 15:01.032
We'd love to send
you here, sweetie.

15:01.034 --> 15:02.533
We just can't afford it.

15:02.535 --> 15:04.569
Well, I'm sure
Lisa will be fine

15:04.571 --> 15:05.904
at Springfield Elementary.

15:05.906 --> 15:09.374
I hear they just found out
there was a World War II.

15:09.376 --> 15:10.541
(chuckles)

15:10.543 --> 15:11.242
(groans)
Oh...

15:11.244 --> 15:14.178
Homer, Lisa, could you
please step outside?

15:14.180 --> 15:17.382
I have a few choice words
for this gentleman.

15:17.384 --> 15:19.617
Mom... please don't.

15:19.619 --> 15:21.619
Oh, I've seen
that look before.

15:21.621 --> 15:23.087
That's the "I ate
the piece of wedding cake

15:23.089 --> 15:25.957
she's been saving
in the freezer ten years" look.

15:25.959 --> 15:27.959
You what?!
Run!

15:27.961 --> 15:30.361
(dramatic music plays)

15:34.100 --> 15:36.334
(screams)

15:44.811 --> 15:46.644
Lisa, your mother
convinced me

15:46.646 --> 15:47.979
to take a closer look
at your record,

15:47.981 --> 15:51.749
and upon further reflection,
I have decided to offer you

15:51.751 --> 15:55.019
a full scholarship
to Cloisters Academy.

15:55.021 --> 15:56.120
I have a future!

15:56.122 --> 15:58.022
Oh! Thank you, Mom!

15:58.024 --> 16:01.392
Oh, thank you,
four-eyes!

16:02.262 --> 16:04.963
So, you'll start Monday.

16:04.965 --> 16:06.097
I'm so exci...

16:06.099 --> 16:08.066
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah.
Quiet campus.

16:08.068 --> 16:08.599
Shh.

16:08.601 --> 16:10.101
Now, please, hold
your celebration

16:10.103 --> 16:12.670
until you're off
the school grounds.

16:15.675 --> 16:18.376
(whooping, cheering, shouting)

16:18.611 --> 16:20.445
(whooping, cheering,
shouting stop)

16:20.447 --> 16:22.347
(whispers):
What time Monday?

16:22.349 --> 16:24.983
Um, 8:00.
Thank you.

16:25.452 --> 16:29.153
(all resume cheering,
whooping, shouting)

16:32.559 --> 16:34.726
(classical music playing)

16:38.064 --> 16:39.564
An academy.

16:39.566 --> 16:42.333
I'm attending an academy.

16:43.003 --> 16:44.035
Hi. I see that you're new,

16:44.037 --> 16:47.271
and we'd be honored to have
you join our softball team.

16:47.273 --> 16:49.407
I'm sorry, I don't really play.

16:49.409 --> 16:50.174
Oh, no one plays.

16:50.176 --> 16:52.210
We just discuss
the physics of the game.

16:52.212 --> 16:56.414
I lead the team in E.R.A.:
Extremely Right Answers.

16:56.416 --> 16:57.448
Count me in!

16:57.450 --> 17:00.351
MARGE:
What's wrong, sweetie?
You seem upset.

17:00.353 --> 17:02.887
I don't want to talk about it.

17:03.690 --> 17:04.689
(groans)
Oh...

17:04.691 --> 17:07.158
A kid at school's
gonna beat me up.

17:07.160 --> 17:08.092
Is it Milhouse?

17:08.094 --> 17:09.494
Milhouse couldn't beat me up.

17:09.496 --> 17:12.397
Are you sure?
He's having a growth spurt.

17:12.399 --> 17:13.631
It's not Milhouse!

17:13.633 --> 17:15.533
Is it a girl?
It's Nelson!

17:15.535 --> 17:18.403
Hm! I never figured him
for the bully type.

17:18.405 --> 17:19.670
Well, if he's got
you cornered,

17:19.672 --> 17:22.040
and Milhouse isn't
there to help you,

17:22.042 --> 17:23.508
there's only one way out--

17:23.510 --> 17:26.411
Make him feel good
about himself!

17:26.413 --> 17:27.545
How do I do that?

17:27.547 --> 17:28.479
I don't know.

17:28.481 --> 17:30.381
Compliment his glasses.

17:30.383 --> 17:33.017
It's not Milhouse!

17:36.823 --> 17:37.622
Hi, Lisa.

17:37.624 --> 17:40.058
I'm Ms. Marshall,
and I'm your teacher.

17:40.060 --> 17:43.594
Well, I am so happy
to be in your class.

17:43.596 --> 17:44.996
No, I'm your teacher.

17:44.998 --> 17:45.530
I only teach you.

17:45.532 --> 17:48.366
Your short story about
the lonely pony-- gripping.

17:48.368 --> 17:51.335
Did you get that the pony
was actually me?

17:51.337 --> 17:52.503
It hit me the next day,

17:52.505 --> 17:54.272
and I read the
whole thing again.

17:54.274 --> 17:56.207
I thought we'd
start the semester

17:56.209 --> 17:58.142
by turning this
into a novel.

17:58.144 --> 17:59.210
Self-published?

17:59.212 --> 18:00.645
Real published.

18:00.647 --> 18:02.380
Oh...

18:07.854 --> 18:11.189
(bell rings,
children chattering)

18:12.325 --> 18:15.059
(thunder rumbling)

18:15.495 --> 18:19.397
NELSON (forebodingly):
Ha... ha...!

18:21.434 --> 18:24.068
(thunder rumbling)

18:27.173 --> 18:27.805
This is it, Simpson!

18:27.807 --> 18:31.209
After this, your nose
will not be an outtie.

18:31.211 --> 18:34.178
Make him feel
good about himself!

18:34.180 --> 18:34.846
(grunts)
Uh, Nelson,

18:34.848 --> 18:37.448
for someone who never
goes to the dentist,

18:37.450 --> 18:39.484
you have pretty
good teeth.

18:39.486 --> 18:40.551
They're dentures!

18:40.553 --> 18:42.854
(grunts)
Uh, you do a lot

18:42.856 --> 18:43.688
with a limited wardrobe.

18:43.690 --> 18:47.258
That's social worker talk
for "I'm poor"!

18:47.260 --> 18:48.593
(grunts)
Uh, uh,

18:48.595 --> 18:50.595
you punch really good!

18:51.164 --> 18:52.363
You think?

18:52.365 --> 18:52.830
Oh, yeah!

18:52.832 --> 18:56.167
And you always avoid the
face around picture day.

18:56.169 --> 18:57.902
People appreciate that.

18:57.904 --> 19:00.404
Hey, those memories are forever.

19:00.406 --> 19:02.440
You really care, man.

19:02.442 --> 19:04.275
A lot of bullies
just phone it in.

19:04.277 --> 19:06.377
(coughs):
Kearney.

19:07.380 --> 19:09.714
That school is so great!

19:09.716 --> 19:11.149
Teachers teach so much better

19:11.151 --> 19:13.384
when they're paid in money,
not chickens.

19:13.386 --> 19:15.520
Is Mom gonna come up
and say good night?

19:15.522 --> 19:16.354
Your mom's doing laundry,

19:16.356 --> 19:19.190
but she authorized me to
say good night for her.

19:19.192 --> 19:21.325
So, by the power
vested in me,

19:21.327 --> 19:24.695
I now pronounce
you sweet dreams.

19:24.697 --> 19:27.165
(giggles)

19:27.167 --> 19:29.133
(door creaks)

19:29.536 --> 19:30.935
(crickets chirping)

19:30.937 --> 19:33.638
(distant rumbling sound)

19:33.640 --> 19:35.439
(louder rumbling sound)

19:35.441 --> 19:36.507
Mom?

19:36.509 --> 19:38.309
(door creaks)

19:38.311 --> 19:39.744
(rumbling)

19:45.752 --> 19:47.518
(groans)
Here we go.

19:47.520 --> 19:49.654
Clean and white...

19:49.656 --> 19:50.955
(yawns)

19:51.457 --> 19:52.723
...and soft...

19:52.725 --> 19:53.791
(snores)

19:53.793 --> 19:55.793
Mom?
(screams)

19:55.795 --> 19:57.061
I see what happened.

19:57.063 --> 19:58.362
There was no scholarship.

19:58.364 --> 20:01.666
They said I could attend
if you did all their laundry!

20:01.668 --> 20:03.234
I can't live with that knowledge

20:03.236 --> 20:04.969
while trying
to get more knowledge.

20:04.971 --> 20:06.704
Lisa, honey,
I insist.

20:06.706 --> 20:11.943
Because it's important
to you that you don't
turn out like me.

20:12.512 --> 20:15.713
Mom, I don't want
to go to that school.

20:15.715 --> 20:16.714
Why not?

20:16.716 --> 20:19.550
Because it's too elitist.

20:19.552 --> 20:22.753
Everyone's parents
are in "the business."

20:22.755 --> 20:23.554
What business?

20:23.556 --> 20:25.356
I don't know.
They won't tell me.

20:25.358 --> 20:28.492
And besides, you were
willing to do all this

20:28.494 --> 20:29.927
just so I would be happy.

20:29.929 --> 20:34.398
Mom, I'd be honored
if I turned out like you.

20:37.670 --> 20:39.637
(slurring):
Mom, thanks to you,

20:39.639 --> 20:42.573
this box sucker
didn't beat me up.

20:42.575 --> 20:44.809
We've been pokin'
foil all night.

20:44.811 --> 20:47.845
Must've put away
two eight-packs by now.

20:47.847 --> 20:50.781
I'm so glad you two
are friends again.

20:50.783 --> 20:52.316
Look what Maggie got!

20:52.318 --> 20:54.652
Homer? How
did you get...
Ah.

20:54.654 --> 20:56.420
A father has his secrets.

20:56.422 --> 20:59.724
How did he get in?
Told you, ain't
got no glass.

20:59.726 --> 21:02.026
Did he take any money?
Uh-uh.

21:02.028 --> 21:04.562
Well, he did now.

21:52.512 --> 21:53.911
Shh!
