04:00.080 --> 04:02.820
Norman, come here. Come here.

04:02.920 --> 04:04.365
Norman.

04:06.080 --> 04:07.580
Hurry up.

04:07.680 --> 04:10.900
The loons. The loons.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.809
They're welcoming us back.

04:14.480 --> 04:16.403
I don't hear a thing.

04:42.840 --> 04:45.620
Just look at this place.

04:45.720 --> 04:48.300
- It's a mess, isn't it?
- Just take a second.

04:48.400 --> 04:51.180
It'll be all shipshape again

04:51.280 --> 04:52.850
and warmer.

06:29.000 --> 06:30.580
Phone works!

06:30.680 --> 06:33.126
At least I think it does.

06:35.600 --> 06:37.940
Hello.

06:38.040 --> 06:41.806
Hello!

06:44.400 --> 06:47.140
Who the hell is that?

06:47.240 --> 06:51.100
Who the hell's in this picture here?

06:51.200 --> 06:53.420
Who the hell is that?

06:53.520 --> 06:56.900
Hello.
Who's this?

06:57.000 --> 06:58.540
The operator?

06:58.640 --> 07:00.900
What do you want?

07:01.000 --> 07:03.300
You called.
You must want something.

07:03.400 --> 07:04.980
Oh, wait a minute.

07:05.080 --> 07:08.380
I did call you, but you never answered.

07:08.480 --> 07:11.300
Well, how are you?

07:11.400 --> 07:13.140
How nice.

07:13.240 --> 07:16.500
Listen, this is Norman Thayer, Jr.
over on Golden Pond.

07:16.600 --> 07:18.100
I have something I want you to do.

07:18.200 --> 07:20.380
Call me up.
Can you do that?

07:20.480 --> 07:23.340
I want to check my phone,
see if it still rings.

07:23.440 --> 07:27.220
Hasn't rung all winter.
May have lost its whatsie.

07:27.320 --> 07:29.100
You have my number?

07:29.200 --> 07:30.940
I have no idea.

07:31.040 --> 07:33.980
It's got a nine, that's all I know.

07:34.080 --> 07:36.606
It's in the book!
You must have a book.

07:37.880 --> 07:39.540
Norman Thayer, Jr.

07:39.640 --> 07:41.642
Let's give her a try, shall we?

07:57.200 --> 07:59.123
Who the hell is that?

08:00.160 --> 08:01.500
Someone's at the door.

08:01.600 --> 08:04.285
It's me, you old poop!

08:09.240 --> 08:11.083
Well, look at you.

08:12.760 --> 08:14.180
Look at me?

08:14.280 --> 08:16.500
Quite a sight, aren't I?

08:16.600 --> 08:20.300
Oh, Norman, it's so beautiful.

08:20.400 --> 08:22.100
Everything's just waking up.

08:22.200 --> 08:25.220
Little tiny birds, little tiny leaves.

08:25.320 --> 08:27.540
I saw a patch of little tiny flowers

08:27.640 --> 08:29.900
over by the old cellar hall.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.700
I forget what they're called.

08:31.800 --> 08:34.900
Little, tiny yellow things.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.780
Well... want to help me
with the dust covers?

08:37.880 --> 08:39.020
I don't have anything else to do.

08:39.120 --> 08:40.610
Come on.

08:42.640 --> 08:44.820
What were you doing out in the woods?

08:44.920 --> 08:47.300
Norman, what do you think I was doing?

08:47.400 --> 08:49.580
I was getting wood.

08:49.680 --> 08:52.260
Hey, I met the nicest couple.

08:52.360 --> 08:54.380
- Huh? Where?
- In the woods.

08:54.480 --> 08:56.580
Couple of people?

08:56.680 --> 08:58.540
No, a couple of antelope.

08:58.640 --> 09:01.500
Of course, a couple of people.

09:01.600 --> 09:03.740
The name is Migliori, I believe.

09:03.840 --> 09:05.740
Migliori?
What sort of name is that?

09:05.840 --> 09:08.140
I don't know, darling.
Italian, I suppose.

09:08.240 --> 09:10.780
- They're up from Boston.
- They speak English?

09:10.880 --> 09:12.780
Well, of course they speak English.

09:12.880 --> 09:15.660
They're a nice, middle-aged couple,
just like us.

09:15.760 --> 09:18.620
If they're just like us,
they're not middle-aged.

09:18.720 --> 09:19.860
Of course they are.

09:19.960 --> 09:21.380
Middle-aged means the middle, Ethel.

09:21.480 --> 09:24.420
Middle of life.
People don't live to be 150!

09:24.520 --> 09:27.580
Well, we're at the far edge
of middle age, that's all.

09:27.680 --> 09:29.140
We're not, you know.

09:29.240 --> 09:31.140
We're not middle-aged.
You're old and I'm ancient.

09:31.240 --> 09:32.580
Oh, pooh!

09:32.680 --> 09:35.180
You're in your 70s and I'm in my 60s.

09:35.280 --> 09:36.940
Just barely, on both counts.

09:37.040 --> 09:39.060
Would you like to spend
the rest of the afternoon

09:39.160 --> 09:40.780
quibbling about this?

09:40.880 --> 09:42.060
We can if you like.

09:42.160 --> 09:43.980
For the Lord's sake.

09:44.080 --> 09:46.580
The Miglioris, whatever their age group,

09:46.680 --> 09:49.420
have invited us to have dinner sometime.

09:49.520 --> 09:51.700
Wouldn't that be nice?

09:51.800 --> 09:54.740
No, I'm not sure my stomach's
ready for rigatoni.

09:54.840 --> 09:57.420
- That sort of thing.
- Oh, no!

09:57.520 --> 09:59.340
Poor Elmer!

09:59.440 --> 10:01.380
He's had a terrible fall.

10:01.480 --> 10:04.900
Poor little Elmer, the life you've led.

10:05.000 --> 10:07.340
He was my first true love, you know.

10:07.440 --> 10:10.500
Known all along
I wasn't the first in line.

10:10.600 --> 10:13.980
No, you were a rather cheap
substitute for Elmer.

10:14.080 --> 10:16.020
And now he's had a fall.

10:16.120 --> 10:19.060
Maybe he wanted to kill himself.
Maybe he wanted to be cremated.

10:19.160 --> 10:21.100
Probably got cancer
or termites or something.

10:21.200 --> 10:24.380
- Shut up, Norman.
- Not a bad way to go, huh?

10:24.480 --> 10:27.860
A quick frontflip off the mantel,
a bit of a kick at the last minute,

10:27.960 --> 10:29.540
end up right in the fire...
nothing to it.

10:29.640 --> 10:31.060
Norman, will you shut up?

10:31.160 --> 10:33.300
When my number's up,
do that for me, will ya?

10:33.400 --> 10:36.420
Prop me up on the mantel
and point out which way is down.

10:36.520 --> 10:38.860
Might even try for a full gainer
with a half twist.

10:38.960 --> 10:42.060
Norman Thayer Jr.,
your fascination with dying

10:42.160 --> 10:44.460
is beginning to frazzle my good humor.

10:44.560 --> 10:46.020
Not fascination.

10:46.120 --> 10:48.500
- Just crosses my mind now and then.
- Every five minutes.

10:48.600 --> 10:50.460
Don't you have anything else
to think about?

10:50.560 --> 10:52.900
Nothing quite as interesting.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.420
Well, what's stopping you?

10:54.520 --> 10:57.820
Why don't you take your dive
and get it over with?

10:57.920 --> 10:59.940
And leave you alone with Elmer?

11:00.040 --> 11:03.660
- You must be mad!
- Oh, for pity's sake.

11:03.760 --> 11:07.048
Come on, help me
get the canoe off the porch.

11:21.720 --> 11:23.340
Norman, are you paddling?

11:23.440 --> 11:24.860
Of course I'm paddling.

11:24.960 --> 11:27.180
Then you're not steering.

11:27.280 --> 11:29.260
You want me to take the stern?

11:29.360 --> 11:30.486
I most certainly do not.

11:41.280 --> 11:43.340
Norman!

11:43.440 --> 11:45.500
- Good God, what is it?
- Look, look!

11:45.600 --> 11:48.180
Oh, look, I've spotted the loons.

11:48.280 --> 11:51.820
Oh, they're so lovely!

11:51.920 --> 11:54.082
Here, here.

11:57.680 --> 11:59.170
Look.

12:04.200 --> 12:06.487
- Can you see them?
- No.

12:08.120 --> 12:11.100
Oh, my goodness!
There they are.

12:11.200 --> 12:12.860
Oh, they're so beautiful.

12:12.960 --> 12:14.380
Yeah, they're huge.

12:14.480 --> 12:17.820
I never saw such big loons in my life.

12:17.920 --> 12:19.860
Those are boats, you poop.

12:19.960 --> 12:21.530
Come in closer.

12:24.080 --> 12:26.765
A husband and wife.

12:28.280 --> 12:30.180
I think they're looking at us.

12:30.280 --> 12:32.726
Yeah, they are.

12:36.880 --> 12:40.340
What the hell's the matter with them?

12:40.440 --> 12:42.660
Hey, buzz off!

12:42.760 --> 12:44.100
Buzz off!

12:44.200 --> 12:47.020
- Ethel, what are you doing?
- What do you mean what am I doing?

12:47.120 --> 12:49.780
- Don't do that.
- Why not? You did it.

12:49.880 --> 12:51.484
Never mind, I'll explain later.

13:08.360 --> 13:12.020
5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.

13:12.120 --> 13:14.900
How about that?
Right on your man.

13:15.000 --> 13:16.020
Where were you?

13:16.120 --> 13:17.700
Where was I?

13:17.800 --> 13:20.060
Oh, come off it.
Don't give me that.

13:20.160 --> 13:23.260
5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10... damn!

13:23.360 --> 13:24.900
11, yes.
Damn it.

13:25.000 --> 13:26.700
Good night, sweet prince.

13:26.800 --> 13:30.043
5, 10, 15, and 20.

13:31.800 --> 13:34.406
Well, mother!

13:54.200 --> 13:55.780
You want to stay here and watch the boat

13:55.880 --> 13:57.660
while I run into the store?

13:57.760 --> 13:59.740
I think I'm qualified to watch the boat.

13:59.840 --> 14:01.340
Come with me if you want to.

14:01.440 --> 14:03.900
- No, thank you very much.
- Okay.

14:04.000 --> 14:05.860
- Hello, Sumner.
- Good morning, Mrs. Thayer.

14:05.960 --> 14:07.780
- Will you fill her up, please?
- Sure.

14:07.880 --> 14:09.484
Norman will help you.

14:25.400 --> 14:27.420
That'll be $38, please, Mr. Thayer.

14:27.520 --> 14:29.260
God...

14:29.360 --> 14:31.980
you know how much gasoline cost
when I was your age?

14:32.080 --> 14:33.820
12 cents a gallon.

14:33.920 --> 14:35.260
Is that a fact?

14:35.360 --> 14:37.249
I didn't even know
they had gas back then.

14:41.920 --> 14:45.100
What are you, a couple of nitwits?

14:45.200 --> 14:47.380
Think it's funny being old?

14:47.480 --> 14:50.020
My whole goddamn body's falling apart.

14:50.120 --> 14:52.740
Sometimes I can't even
go to the bathroom when I want to.

14:52.840 --> 14:55.500
But I'm still a man, let me tell you.
And I can take on both you punks!

14:55.600 --> 14:57.125
Norman!
Here we go.

15:02.400 --> 15:04.164
Thanks, boys.

15:08.320 --> 15:09.924
I'll drive home.

15:11.120 --> 15:13.500
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

15:13.600 --> 15:15.860
If I make the wrong turn
and wind up in Michigan

15:15.960 --> 15:17.769
or someplace, be sure you let me know.

15:31.040 --> 15:32.460
Someone's at the door.

15:32.560 --> 15:35.291
It's me, you old poop!

15:41.760 --> 15:44.220
- Where you been?
- Picking strawberries.

15:44.320 --> 15:46.820
There were oodles and oodles
of little strawberries

15:46.920 --> 15:49.500
- along the old town road.
- How nice.

15:49.600 --> 15:51.460
What on earth you're doing in here

15:51.560 --> 15:53.900
on a morning like this,
Norman, is beyond me.

15:54.000 --> 15:55.820
I've been quite busy looking through

15:55.920 --> 15:58.060
yesterday's paper
for gainful employment.

15:58.160 --> 16:01.220
- Here we go again.
- Very good prospects, I think.

16:01.320 --> 16:03.620
Chauffeurs, yard work.

16:03.720 --> 16:07.100
Dairy Divine wants a...
ice cream dipper.

16:07.200 --> 16:08.460
I think I can do something like that.

16:08.560 --> 16:10.700
Don't you?
What do you think?

16:10.800 --> 16:14.300
What are you gonna do
if you call and they say,

16:14.400 --> 16:16.180
"Come on over and start tomorrow"?

16:16.280 --> 16:17.540
I'll go on over and start tomorrow.

16:17.640 --> 16:19.820
Oh, for the love of God, Norman,

16:19.920 --> 16:22.700
what on earth's the matter with you?

16:22.800 --> 16:24.740
Look, give me that stuff.

16:24.840 --> 16:26.500
Why don't you take these buckets

16:26.600 --> 16:28.540
and go pick us another quart
of strawberries?

16:28.640 --> 16:32.700
And I'll fix us up a scrumptious
strawberry shortcake for lunch.

16:32.800 --> 16:34.380
Go on.

16:34.480 --> 16:36.300
You want me to pick strawberries?

16:36.400 --> 16:39.220
Yep. Do I have to put an ad
in the paper?

16:39.320 --> 16:41.660
I'm not sure I know
how to pick strawberries.

16:41.760 --> 16:44.660
It's really very simple, Norman.
Bend over and pick them.

16:44.760 --> 16:45.980
Bend over?

16:46.080 --> 16:47.260
Where are they?

16:47.360 --> 16:49.340
On the ground where they belong.

16:49.440 --> 16:51.620
Last time we picked
blueberries on a bush.

16:51.720 --> 16:53.180
You didn't have to bend over at all.

16:53.280 --> 16:55.647
These are strawberries
and they grow on the ground.

16:57.640 --> 16:59.420
Here comes whatshisname.

16:59.520 --> 17:01.060
He'll have the paper, you know.

17:01.160 --> 17:03.500
I don't want to miss
any career opportunities

17:03.600 --> 17:04.780
off looking for strawberries.

17:04.880 --> 17:06.260
I'll pay you, Norman.

17:06.359 --> 17:08.180
May be the beginning of something big.

17:08.280 --> 17:11.099
You may become
a major strawberry picker.

17:11.200 --> 17:14.099
Not if I'm bending over all the time.
I think you're trying to kill me.

17:14.200 --> 17:16.819
- I thought about it.
- Well, you needn't bother.

17:16.920 --> 17:18.859
I'm living on borrowed time as it is.

17:18.960 --> 17:22.900
Will you take your cheery personality
and get out of here?

17:23.000 --> 17:26.819
I hope you're prepared to massage
my bent back this evening.

17:26.920 --> 17:29.100
With pleasure.

17:29.200 --> 17:33.444
Maybe I can lie down
to pick the berries.

17:42.440 --> 17:43.820
Morning, Ethel.

17:43.920 --> 17:45.380
Hi, Charlie!

17:45.480 --> 17:47.020
Come on up and have some coffee.

17:47.120 --> 17:48.565
You can take five minutes.

17:50.280 --> 17:52.442
You got a letter from Chelsea.

17:53.800 --> 17:55.860
The rest is just bills
and junk like that.

17:55.960 --> 17:57.803
Sure.
Go on in.

18:02.280 --> 18:04.060
I think I broke your door.

18:04.160 --> 18:06.420
No, no, it's been that way
for months now.

18:06.520 --> 18:09.180
Norman's supposed to fix it,
but I'm afraid it's not high

18:09.280 --> 18:12.045
on his list of priorities.

19:58.800 --> 20:00.220
Oh, Charl...

20:00.320 --> 20:02.220
Hi, Norman.

20:02.320 --> 20:04.100
Norman, are you back already?

20:04.200 --> 20:05.580
You barely left.

20:05.680 --> 20:07.660
So? I moved fast.

20:07.760 --> 20:09.980
Ran all the way and picked
without stopping on the way back.

20:10.080 --> 20:11.500
Let me see what you've got.

20:11.600 --> 20:14.660
- I'll just dump 'em in with yours.
- No.

20:14.760 --> 20:17.020
Not a single berry.

20:17.120 --> 20:18.860
What's the matter with you?

20:18.960 --> 20:21.088
I must have eaten them all.

20:22.400 --> 20:24.700
No mail today, Charlie?

20:24.800 --> 20:27.280
Holy mackinoly, I left it on the porch.

20:29.040 --> 20:31.060
How 'bout bringing it in?
Can you do that?

20:31.160 --> 20:33.003
Oh, you bet.

20:36.120 --> 20:38.646
- Glass of milk, Norman?
- No.

20:40.320 --> 20:43.340
I see you broke
the screen door, Charlie.

20:43.440 --> 20:47.700
Well, it's just missing its little
thingamabobbers for the hinges.

20:47.800 --> 20:49.620
I could bring you a couple
from town tomorrow.

20:49.720 --> 20:51.500
Just be careful next time.

20:51.600 --> 20:54.100
Here it is, Norman.
Drink it.

20:54.200 --> 20:56.020
Thank you, nurse.

20:56.120 --> 20:59.380
Finish your coffee over here.

20:59.480 --> 21:01.130
There you go.

21:10.480 --> 21:11.860
What you got there, Norman?

21:11.960 --> 21:14.340
I have no idea.
I can't open it.

21:14.440 --> 21:17.171
Here, bite this, please.

21:22.760 --> 21:24.860
Oh, just his medicine.

21:24.960 --> 21:27.740
Oh, goody.
What a swell surprise.

21:27.840 --> 21:29.940
Nothing serious.
Just for his palpitations.

21:30.040 --> 21:33.180
That's right, Charlie,
I have occasional heartthrobs.

21:33.280 --> 21:36.380
Norman, we got a letter from Chelsea.

21:36.480 --> 21:39.580
Look at the goddamn Orioles!

21:39.680 --> 21:42.500
Baltimore's always been a sneaky town.

21:42.600 --> 21:44.260
Norman.

21:44.360 --> 21:46.340
She's coming for your birthday.

21:46.440 --> 21:48.740
How nice.

21:48.840 --> 21:52.020
Yep, and she's bringing a friend.

21:52.120 --> 21:55.100
- She has the nicest boyfriend.
- Oh?

21:55.200 --> 21:58.820
They're coming together and then
they're going on to Europe for a while.

21:58.920 --> 22:00.500
Oh, really?

22:00.600 --> 22:03.740
I don't want crowds of people
coming on my birthday.

22:03.840 --> 22:06.900
I don't want crowds of people
watching me turn older.

22:07.000 --> 22:08.700
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

22:08.800 --> 22:10.660
It's not that Freddie person.

22:10.760 --> 22:13.060
This is a different boyfriend
altogether.

22:13.160 --> 22:15.620
What the hell's going on?

22:15.720 --> 22:17.180
Detroit's disappeared!

22:17.280 --> 22:18.700
Good God!

22:18.800 --> 22:20.060
What is it, Norman?

22:20.160 --> 22:22.980
Detroit's gone.

22:23.080 --> 22:26.260
What happened to her husband?

22:26.360 --> 22:28.180
What is it, Charlie?

22:28.280 --> 22:30.660
I was wondering what happened
to Chelsea's husband.

22:30.760 --> 22:32.728
It didn't work out.

22:34.880 --> 22:36.882
Hey...

22:38.360 --> 22:41.420
she... she says...

22:41.520 --> 22:44.900
she says she's in love with a dentist.

22:45.000 --> 22:47.300
Does her boyfriend know about this?

22:47.400 --> 22:48.940
This is her new boyfriend.

22:49.040 --> 22:50.940
Her new boyfriend is a dentist.

22:51.040 --> 22:52.420
That's who she's bringing here?

22:52.520 --> 22:54.340
- A dentist?
- Yeah.

22:54.440 --> 22:55.900
Good God!

22:56.000 --> 22:58.260
He'll be staring at our teeth
all the time.

22:58.360 --> 23:01.460
Well, shall we ask him not to come?

23:01.560 --> 23:03.940
No, I think we should have
representatives

23:04.040 --> 23:07.060
from all walks of life
at my last birthday party.

23:07.160 --> 23:08.180
Oh, lorks!

23:08.280 --> 23:10.540
I think this medicine should be put away

23:10.640 --> 23:13.211
from all this hot air.

23:14.640 --> 23:17.100
Why didn't you marry Chelsea?

23:17.200 --> 23:19.740
- You wouldn't let me.
- Oh?

23:19.840 --> 23:22.500
You could've married somebody else.
I'd have allowed that.

23:22.600 --> 23:25.285
- I didn't want anyone else.
- Oh?

23:28.280 --> 23:30.060
How old will you be?

23:30.160 --> 23:31.980
- When?
- On your birthday.

23:32.080 --> 23:34.048
103.

23:37.000 --> 23:39.300
Miss Appley was 97 in May.

23:39.400 --> 23:42.340
- Isn't that amazing?
- Yeah.

23:42.440 --> 23:44.780
- She died, you know.
- No.

23:44.880 --> 23:46.660
Yeah, last Tuesday.

23:46.760 --> 23:49.604
We got a call,
in case any mail comes up.

23:50.680 --> 23:53.524
Gave you a forwarding address
for Miss Appley?

23:56.280 --> 23:57.860
What's so funny?

23:57.960 --> 23:59.780
One of the lesbians expired.

23:59.880 --> 24:02.820
Oh, no.
Which one, Charlie?

24:02.920 --> 24:04.684
Miss Appley.

24:05.920 --> 24:08.220
Well, she had a good, full life.

24:08.320 --> 24:10.900
Charlie said she was 97.

24:11.000 --> 24:12.580
97!

24:12.680 --> 24:14.380
Isn't that wonderful?

24:14.480 --> 24:16.540
Puts us all to shame, doesn't it?

24:16.640 --> 24:19.769
There's something to be said
for a deviant lifestyle.

24:20.800 --> 24:23.700
Well, thanks for the coffee, Ethel.

24:23.800 --> 24:25.900
You still make the best biscuits
on the lake.

24:26.000 --> 24:27.500
Thank you, Charlie.

24:27.600 --> 24:29.980
You must come around when Chelsea comes.

24:30.080 --> 24:32.740
Hey, I haven't seen her in a long time.

24:32.840 --> 24:34.220
No.

24:34.320 --> 24:36.060
Well...

24:36.160 --> 24:37.860
Norman.

24:37.960 --> 24:39.380
Charlie's leaving.

24:39.480 --> 24:41.420
Good!
Bye.

24:41.520 --> 24:43.284
Good-bye.

24:44.560 --> 24:47.564
Watch out for that screen door.

24:58.680 --> 25:00.100
Norman!

25:00.200 --> 25:03.409
The loons are teaching
their baby to fly.

25:05.600 --> 25:08.940
- Isn't that exciting?
- Listen to this.

25:09.040 --> 25:12.100
"Retired people sought
for handbill delivery.

25:12.200 --> 25:14.460
Some walking involved."

25:14.560 --> 25:16.300
I should call.
I can walk.

25:16.400 --> 25:19.300
Is that why you came rushing back here,

25:19.400 --> 25:22.449
to read those goddamned ads?

25:30.880 --> 25:33.611
You wanna know why I came back so fast?

25:35.000 --> 25:38.100
I got to the end of our lane,

25:38.200 --> 25:41.044
I couldn't remember
where the old town road was.

25:42.280 --> 25:43.820
I wandered away in the woods.

25:43.920 --> 25:46.420
There was nothing familiar,
not one damn tree.

25:46.520 --> 25:49.340
Scared me half to death.

25:49.440 --> 25:51.940
That's why I came...

25:52.040 --> 25:54.340
running back here to you...

25:54.440 --> 25:57.660
to see your pretty face.

25:57.760 --> 26:01.128
I could feel safe.
I was still me.

26:12.720 --> 26:15.451
You're safe, you old poop.

26:17.120 --> 26:19.691
And you're definitely still you.

26:20.880 --> 26:24.043
Picking on poor old Charlie.

26:27.320 --> 26:29.322
After lunch...

26:30.520 --> 26:34.620
after we've gobbled up
all those silly strawberries,

26:34.720 --> 26:38.660
we'll take ourselves
to the old town road.

26:38.760 --> 26:42.048
We've been there
a thousand times, darling.

26:43.600 --> 26:47.127
A thousand, and you'll remember it all.

26:49.960 --> 26:51.928
Listen to me, mister.

26:53.400 --> 26:56.460
You're my knight in shining armor.

26:56.560 --> 26:58.780
Don't you forget it.

26:58.880 --> 27:01.620
You're gonna get back
on that little horse,

27:01.720 --> 27:05.460
and I'm gonna be right behind you,
holding on tight.

27:05.560 --> 27:09.700
And away we're gonna go, go, go.

27:09.800 --> 27:11.768
I don't like horses.

27:18.720 --> 27:23.044
You are a pretty old dame, aren't you?

27:24.600 --> 27:28.620
What are you doing with a dotty
old son of a bitch like me?

27:28.720 --> 27:30.700
Well...

27:30.800 --> 27:33.724
I haven't the vaguest idea.

28:13.240 --> 28:16.660
I don't think you should do that
in front of Chelsea's companion.

28:16.760 --> 28:18.300
Oh, pooh!

28:18.400 --> 28:21.260
I was just talking to my friends.

28:21.360 --> 28:22.980
Hey, look at you!

28:23.080 --> 28:25.380
My, oh, my.
You have on a tie.

28:25.480 --> 28:28.340
Yes, I know.
I put it there.

28:28.440 --> 28:29.900
Do I look all right?

28:30.000 --> 28:31.740
I haven't overdressed, have I?

28:31.840 --> 28:33.420
You look sexy.

28:33.520 --> 28:35.820
I'm gonna have to do
some pretty fast maneuvers

28:35.920 --> 28:37.060
to catch up with you!

28:37.160 --> 28:38.700
I have some other ties.

28:38.800 --> 28:40.928
You could come as Miss Appley.

28:42.080 --> 28:43.570
Thank you.

29:04.840 --> 29:07.260
"Welcome home, Chelsea"?

29:07.360 --> 29:09.540
I see my birthday party

29:09.640 --> 29:11.940
wasn't cause enough for celebration.

29:12.040 --> 29:15.442
I just wanted our little girl
to feel welcome, that's all.

29:17.920 --> 29:19.660
Norman.

29:19.760 --> 29:23.401
Wouldn't it be nice if we could
all get along this time?

29:25.440 --> 29:27.300
Where the hell are they?

29:27.400 --> 29:29.100
I'm getting older by the minute.

29:29.200 --> 29:31.340
They said they'd be here
when they get here.

29:31.440 --> 29:33.020
- Is that what they said?
- Yep.

29:33.120 --> 29:35.220
That's a hell of an attitude.

29:35.320 --> 29:38.020
No wonder we don't have
any grandchildren.

29:38.120 --> 29:40.580
What would we do with grandchildren?

29:40.680 --> 29:42.740
Toss them on our knee.

29:42.840 --> 29:45.140
We're the last of the Thayers, you know.

29:45.240 --> 29:47.700
End of the line for a damn good name.

29:47.800 --> 29:51.691
Yep, and we're gonna
take it out in style.

29:52.920 --> 29:55.180
Oh, my God!
They're here.

29:55.280 --> 29:56.820
I'm not even dressed.

29:56.920 --> 29:58.740
I look like an old character.

29:58.840 --> 30:00.860
You are an old character.

30:00.960 --> 30:04.442
Go on upstairs and change
if it'll make you feel any better.

30:05.480 --> 30:08.300
- Be nice to them.
- Sure.

30:08.400 --> 30:11.020
I'll explain the risks involved
in being late

30:11.120 --> 30:13.020
to an old man's birthday party.

30:13.120 --> 30:14.220
Anybody home?

30:14.320 --> 30:16.100
Too late.

30:16.200 --> 30:20.140
Look, move that flower vase
over to the other side of the table.

30:20.240 --> 30:22.500
- Why?
- Just do it, Norman!

30:22.600 --> 30:24.409
For once, just do it!

30:30.560 --> 30:32.340
Hey! Oh, Mommy!

30:32.440 --> 30:35.500
Oh, darling!
What a treat.

30:35.600 --> 30:38.140
Let me look at you.
Oh, you look great.

30:38.240 --> 30:41.020
- Where is he?
- Just inside the door. Go ahead.

30:41.120 --> 30:42.610
He's waiting for you.

30:49.280 --> 30:50.930
Hello, Norman.

30:54.600 --> 30:57.380
- Well, look at you.
- Happy birthday!

30:57.480 --> 31:00.660
Look at this little fat girl, Ethel.

31:00.760 --> 31:02.740
Oh, Norman.

31:02.840 --> 31:05.140
You're as thin as a rail.

31:05.240 --> 31:06.860
- Isn't she?
- Sure.

31:06.960 --> 31:10.580
Oh, my darling,
I'm so glad you're home.

31:10.680 --> 31:13.220
- Here, give me all those.
- I didn't think we were gonna make it.

31:13.320 --> 31:15.660
We rented a car that explodes
every 40 miles.

31:15.760 --> 31:17.780
- Rented a car?
- In Boston.

31:17.880 --> 31:20.580
What sort of car is it?

31:20.680 --> 31:23.740
I don't know.
Green, I think.

31:23.840 --> 31:25.580
Ooh, a green car.

31:25.680 --> 31:27.980
I meant what sort of make is it?

31:28.080 --> 31:30.020
I don't know.

31:30.120 --> 31:32.500
She doesn't know, Norman.
It doesn't matter.

31:32.600 --> 31:35.860
Of course it doesn't matter.
I was just curious.

31:35.960 --> 31:37.780
Well, I guess I should have looked.

31:37.880 --> 31:42.020
Let's see... it's very ugly
and it breaks down a lot.

31:42.120 --> 31:44.540
Ugly and breaks down?

31:44.640 --> 31:46.740
Sounds like a Nash.

31:46.840 --> 31:49.540
Yes, well...

31:49.640 --> 31:51.820
Where... where's your friend?

31:51.920 --> 31:53.860
You did bring your friend, didn't you?

31:53.960 --> 31:56.220
I knew there was something
I was forgetting.

31:56.320 --> 31:57.780
That's still on, huh?

31:57.880 --> 31:59.500
Well, as far as I know.

31:59.600 --> 32:00.820
Come on in.

32:00.920 --> 32:02.660
No one's gonna bite you.
Come on.

32:02.760 --> 32:04.888
Mommy, Norman, this is Billy Ray.

32:08.800 --> 32:10.529
How you doing?

32:12.240 --> 32:14.420
You seem awfully young to be a dentist.

32:14.520 --> 32:16.204
This is Billy Ray, Jr.

32:18.120 --> 32:20.300
I'm Norman Thayer, Jr.
Worse.

32:20.400 --> 32:22.020
His father is trying to park the car.

32:22.120 --> 32:24.020
Well, this is a great surprise.

32:24.120 --> 32:25.780
You can call me Ethel, Billy.

32:25.880 --> 32:27.620
And you can call Norman Norman.

32:27.720 --> 32:29.420
I like your logic, Mommy.

32:29.520 --> 32:32.260
I'm gonna go see if Bill
has driven into the lake.

32:32.360 --> 32:34.362
Put away some of these things.

32:40.120 --> 32:41.940
I hear you turned 80 today.

32:42.040 --> 32:43.460
That what you heard?

32:43.560 --> 32:45.540
Yeah.

32:45.640 --> 32:47.460
Man, that's really old.

32:47.560 --> 32:50.980
You should meet my father.

32:51.080 --> 32:52.740
Your father's still alive?

32:52.840 --> 32:54.500
No, but you should meet him.

32:54.600 --> 32:56.540
Isn't this fun?

32:56.640 --> 33:00.100
Norman, why don't we put Billy
in Chelsea's old room?

33:00.200 --> 33:02.340
Then he can look out at the lake
in the morning.

33:02.440 --> 33:03.860
Why don't we put him out on the float?

33:03.960 --> 33:05.580
He can look at the lake all night long.

33:05.680 --> 33:07.460
I'd like that.

33:07.560 --> 33:09.740
I'm afraid you'd be eaten alive
by all the bugs.

33:09.840 --> 33:12.980
- So?
- Norman, take him up.

33:13.080 --> 33:14.700
Show him where everything is.

33:14.800 --> 33:16.370
Come on, boy.

33:19.280 --> 33:22.460
I just had a birthday too.
I turned 13 two weeks ago.

33:22.560 --> 33:25.040
Oh? We're practically twins.

33:34.080 --> 33:37.140
- I'm so glad you're here.
- He'll be right in.

33:37.240 --> 33:39.340
He actually thinks
you have to lock your car.

33:39.440 --> 33:41.140
Mommy...

33:41.240 --> 33:42.940
Norman looks so old.

33:43.040 --> 33:45.247
Oh, I don't know.

33:46.360 --> 33:48.340
You look great, though.

33:48.440 --> 33:50.100
Thank you.
So do you.

33:50.200 --> 33:51.820
I love your hair.

33:51.920 --> 33:54.060
Thanks.
How's his mind?

33:54.160 --> 33:55.740
Is he remembering things better?

33:55.840 --> 33:58.340
- Is he...
- He's all right.

33:58.440 --> 33:59.460
He's all right.

33:59.560 --> 34:01.020
Come on, Billy.

34:01.120 --> 34:05.603
I'll show you the bathroom,
if I can remember where it is.

34:07.600 --> 34:09.620
Well, at least he hasn't changed.

34:09.719 --> 34:12.020
Nope, he's still impossible.

34:12.120 --> 34:15.420
It means so much to him
to have you here.

34:15.520 --> 34:16.940
Sure, now he's got
someone he can pick on.

34:17.040 --> 34:20.300
Oh, come on.
Thank you for coming.

34:20.400 --> 34:21.900
Thank you for inviting me.

34:22.000 --> 34:23.525
Chels.

34:25.239 --> 34:27.659
Well, you finally made it.

34:27.760 --> 34:28.820
This is my mother.

34:28.920 --> 34:31.139
- Hi.
- Mommy, this is Bill Ray.

34:31.239 --> 34:33.300
- I think I saw a bear.
- Oh, no.

34:33.400 --> 34:35.980
You couldn't have seen a bear out there
at this time of year.

34:36.080 --> 34:39.380
There are some rather nasty moths
flying around, though.

34:39.480 --> 34:42.300
No, no, this was a little big
for a moth.

34:42.400 --> 34:45.460
If you really wanna be scared,
wait till you meet my father.

34:45.560 --> 34:47.460
- Hey, Dad!
- Hey, Billy!

34:47.560 --> 34:50.139
Dad, they do have indoor plumbing here.

34:50.239 --> 34:51.620
Oh, great!

34:51.719 --> 34:53.739
Chelsea was just bullshitting us.

34:53.840 --> 34:56.820
I like to paint a rather rustic picture
of life on Golden Pond.

34:56.920 --> 34:59.020
It's rustic, all right!

34:59.120 --> 35:00.780
It's lovely, though.
It's lovely rusticity.

35:00.880 --> 35:04.123
We've been peeing indoors for 40 years.

35:05.600 --> 35:07.220
Well, you must be Norman.

35:07.320 --> 35:09.100
Must be.
Who are you?

35:09.200 --> 35:11.140
- Bill Ray.
- Bill Ray.

35:11.240 --> 35:12.540
- The dentist?
- Yes, sir.

35:12.640 --> 35:14.369
Want to see my teeth?

35:17.040 --> 35:19.740
I'd just like to tell you, sir,
how glad we are to be here.

35:19.840 --> 35:21.580
Chelsea has told me so much about you

35:21.680 --> 35:24.380
and your lovely wife,
your wonderful place here on the lake.

35:24.480 --> 35:26.220
We're very pleased
she's brought us here.

35:26.320 --> 35:29.180
I'm frankly surprised
Chelsea could find the way.

35:29.280 --> 35:32.940
Well, she's here, Norman,
and that's what's important.

35:33.040 --> 35:34.700
Do you visit your parents, young man?

35:34.800 --> 35:37.420
No, sir.
My parents both passed away.

35:37.520 --> 35:40.180
I see. Then you have
a good excuse, don't you?

35:40.280 --> 35:41.660
Norman, please.

35:41.760 --> 35:43.460
Norman, why...

35:43.560 --> 35:46.300
What? Am I not allowed
to speak to our guests?

35:46.400 --> 35:47.940
Is that it?

35:48.040 --> 35:50.122
They're afraid I'm gonna embarrass them.

35:52.200 --> 35:55.140
Well, I'm going to go
say hello to the lake.

35:55.240 --> 35:58.540
- Anybody coming?
- Me.

35:58.640 --> 36:01.340
I've never seen anyone
say hello to a lake before.

36:01.440 --> 36:03.140
Mommy, are you coming?

36:03.240 --> 36:06.380
Yeah.
Want to take the boat?

36:06.480 --> 36:08.220
A boat?
All right!

36:08.320 --> 36:09.367
Bill, aren't you coming?

36:11.000 --> 36:12.340
Where, outside?

36:12.440 --> 36:14.620
Well, that's where the lake is.

36:14.720 --> 36:16.740
Coming, Norman?

36:16.840 --> 36:20.020
No, I think I'll just sit here
and enjoy the quiet.

36:20.120 --> 36:21.660
I'll stay, too.

36:21.760 --> 36:22.921
With Bill.

36:25.400 --> 36:26.820
The screen door is broken.

36:26.920 --> 36:30.163
Really?
Norman will fix it.

36:47.600 --> 36:49.020
I love your house.

36:49.120 --> 36:51.168
Thank you.
It's not for sale.

36:53.640 --> 36:55.300
I don't want to buy it, I just like it.

36:55.400 --> 36:58.260
It has a...

36:58.360 --> 37:00.124
charming ambiance.

37:07.360 --> 37:10.020
Well, how does it feel to turn 80?

37:10.120 --> 37:13.980
Twice as bad as it did turning 40.

37:14.080 --> 37:16.780
I know what that's like.

37:16.880 --> 37:20.009
I turned 405 years ago.

37:23.760 --> 37:25.524
I'm 45 now.

37:31.880 --> 37:34.060
Norman...

37:34.160 --> 37:35.900
Do you mind if I call you Norman?

37:36.000 --> 37:37.860
I believe you just did.

37:37.960 --> 37:39.724
I don't want to press.

37:42.680 --> 37:44.780
What should I call your wife?

37:44.880 --> 37:46.420
How about Ethel?

37:46.520 --> 37:49.580
That's her name.
Ethel Thayer.

37:49.680 --> 37:51.780
Thounds like I'm lithping, doesn't it?

37:51.880 --> 37:54.220
Ethel Thayer.

37:54.320 --> 37:56.380
- Almost kept her from marrying me.
- Yeah?

37:56.480 --> 37:58.460
Wanted me to change
my last name to hers.

37:58.560 --> 38:00.847
- And what was that?
- I don't remember.

38:06.240 --> 38:07.730
Well...

38:09.880 --> 38:11.780
I think I'll...

38:11.880 --> 38:14.420
start a new book.

38:14.520 --> 38:18.940
See if I can finish it
before I'm finished myself.

38:19.040 --> 38:21.580
Maybe a novelette.

38:21.680 --> 38:25.980
Maybe something from
Reader's Digest abridged.

38:26.080 --> 38:28.500
Treasure island.

38:28.600 --> 38:29.820
Ever read this book?

38:29.920 --> 38:31.420
Oh, yeah.
That's a great book.

38:31.520 --> 38:34.020
I'd highly recommend that one.

38:34.120 --> 38:37.140
No need for that.
I've read it myself.

38:37.240 --> 38:40.220
But my mind is going, so...

38:40.320 --> 38:42.288
it'll all be new to me.

38:45.240 --> 38:48.860
That son of yours ever read this book?

38:48.960 --> 38:50.820
I don't think so.

38:50.920 --> 38:54.020
Your son hasn't read Treasure island?

38:54.120 --> 38:56.620
No, but I intend to have him read it.

38:56.720 --> 38:59.700
His mother's been the real force
in his life lately,

38:59.800 --> 39:02.860
but I intend to eradicate...

39:02.960 --> 39:05.260
some of the...

39:05.360 --> 39:06.805
dishevelment.

39:12.320 --> 39:14.163
Actually...

39:15.760 --> 39:17.580
actually, things are...

39:17.680 --> 39:19.740
coming together
very nicely for me lately.

39:19.840 --> 39:23.128
I'm beginning to feel
very good about myself.

39:25.400 --> 39:26.940
Meeting...

39:27.040 --> 39:29.247
meeting Chelsea was a major...

39:31.560 --> 39:33.164
thing.

39:35.280 --> 39:36.700
We have a...

39:36.800 --> 39:38.660
we have a very kinetic relationship.

39:38.760 --> 39:40.580
It's very positive.

39:40.680 --> 39:42.340
I'm sure you'd be pleased.

39:42.440 --> 39:44.980
What do you charge for a filling?

39:45.080 --> 39:46.300
You're a dentist, aren't you?

39:46.400 --> 39:48.540
What do you charge for a filling?

39:48.640 --> 39:50.700
Oh, it's generally $40.

39:50.800 --> 39:54.168
$40! Good God!

40:06.800 --> 40:08.370
Norman...

40:10.240 --> 40:12.140
we'd like to sleep together,

40:12.240 --> 40:14.980
if it's all right with you.

40:15.080 --> 40:17.220
What do you mean?

40:17.320 --> 40:20.140
We'd... we'd like to sleep together

40:20.240 --> 40:22.060
in the same room...

40:22.160 --> 40:24.180
the same bed...

40:24.280 --> 40:27.220
if it's not offensive to you.

40:27.320 --> 40:29.380
All three of you?

40:29.480 --> 40:32.260
No, just two.

40:32.360 --> 40:34.460
You and Billy?

40:34.560 --> 40:37.340
No.

40:37.440 --> 40:40.140
Not Chelsea and Billy.

40:40.240 --> 40:42.300
No.

40:42.400 --> 40:45.100
That leaves Chelsea and you, then.

40:45.200 --> 40:47.060
That's right.

40:47.160 --> 40:49.540
Why would I find that offensive?

40:49.640 --> 40:53.460
You're not planning on doing
something unusual, are you?

40:53.560 --> 40:56.420
No, no, no.
Just...

40:56.520 --> 40:59.500
you know, just...

40:59.600 --> 41:01.940
that doesn't seem too offensive,

41:02.040 --> 41:04.180
as long as you're quiet.

41:04.280 --> 41:05.820
Thank you.

41:05.920 --> 41:08.300
Chelsea always slept in the same bed
with her husband.

41:08.400 --> 41:10.460
- Yeah, I'm sure.
- Ethel and I do, you know?

41:10.560 --> 41:13.260
We sleep together.
Been doing it for years.

41:13.360 --> 41:17.340
I guess I'd be delighted to have you

41:17.440 --> 41:19.900
abuse my daughter under my own roof.

41:20.000 --> 41:23.460
Would you like the room
where I first violated her mother?

41:23.560 --> 41:26.020
Or would you be interested
in the master bedroom?

41:26.120 --> 41:28.100
Ethel, your boy and I
could sleep out back.

41:28.200 --> 41:29.580
You could do it right here
in the hearth.

41:29.680 --> 41:31.569
Like that idea?

41:35.520 --> 41:37.900
You're having a good time, aren't you?

41:38.000 --> 41:40.860
Chelsea told me all about
how you like to have

41:40.960 --> 41:42.860
a good ol' time with people's heads.

41:42.960 --> 41:45.900
She does, too, sometimes.

41:46.000 --> 41:50.300
Sometimes I can get into it,
and sometimes not.

41:50.400 --> 41:52.540
I think you should know I'm pretty good

41:52.640 --> 41:55.860
at recognizing crap when I hear it.

41:55.960 --> 42:00.460
You know, it's not imperative
that you and I become friends.

42:00.560 --> 42:02.050
I thought it would be nice.

42:04.880 --> 42:08.540
I'm sure you're
a very fascinating person.

42:08.640 --> 42:12.100
And I thought it would be fascinating
getting to know you,

42:12.200 --> 42:14.965
but it's obviously not an easy task.

42:17.280 --> 42:18.725
No.

42:20.520 --> 42:23.980
Just go ahead and be...

42:24.080 --> 42:26.500
as "poopy" as you want,
to quote Chelsea.

42:26.600 --> 42:29.420
And I'll be as receptive
and as pleasant as I can be.

42:29.520 --> 42:33.380
But I want you to bear one thing in mind

42:33.480 --> 42:37.300
while you're jerking me around,
making me feel like an asshole.

42:37.400 --> 42:40.660
I know precisely what you're up to.

42:40.760 --> 42:44.481
And I'll take just so much of it, okay?

42:46.840 --> 42:50.900
Now, what is the bottom line
on this illicit sex question?

42:51.000 --> 42:52.580
Very good.

42:52.680 --> 42:55.060
That was a good speech.

42:55.160 --> 42:57.891
Bottom line?
You're a bottom-line man.

42:59.120 --> 43:01.900
All right, here's the bottom line.

43:02.000 --> 43:05.300
Okay.

43:06.960 --> 43:08.820
You seem like a nice man.

43:08.920 --> 43:11.180
- A bit verbose, but nice.
- Thank you.

43:11.280 --> 43:12.700
And you're right about me.

43:12.800 --> 43:14.820
- I am fascinating.
- I'm sure you are.

43:14.920 --> 43:16.380
Let's get back to talking about sex.

43:16.480 --> 43:19.020
Anything you want to know, just ask me.

43:19.120 --> 43:21.340
No, I just...

43:21.440 --> 43:25.660
I just wanted to clear up
that little question.

43:25.760 --> 43:28.180
Chelsea and I can sleep together, right?

43:28.280 --> 43:29.611
Sure, please do.

43:31.160 --> 43:34.004
Just don't let Ethel catch you.

43:36.040 --> 43:39.540
Dad, Dad, I paddled the canoe!

43:39.640 --> 43:41.900
A canoe! It's a boat!
Just like Indians had.

43:42.000 --> 43:46.340
Actually, the Indians used
a different grade of aluminum.

43:46.440 --> 43:48.060
Listen, Chelsea wants you
to come down to the lake.

43:48.160 --> 43:50.060
She and Ethel are going skinny-dipping!

43:50.160 --> 43:51.340
Skinny-dipping?

43:51.440 --> 43:54.100
Go ahead, permissiveness runs rampant

43:54.200 --> 43:55.820
here on Golden Pond.

43:55.920 --> 43:57.490
Let's go.

44:02.880 --> 44:04.500
Are there any bears around here?

44:04.600 --> 44:08.260
Oh, sure.
Black bears and grizzlies.

44:08.360 --> 44:11.125
One came along here last month
and ate an old lesbian.

44:13.200 --> 44:14.700
Dad, come on.

44:14.800 --> 44:16.780
He's just bullshitting you.

44:16.880 --> 44:18.460
Come on.

44:18.560 --> 44:20.100
Yeah.

44:20.200 --> 44:22.180
Hey, hey, where do you think
you're going?

44:22.280 --> 44:24.100
- Skinny-dipping with Chelsea.
- No, no, no.

44:24.200 --> 44:26.740
You're going back inside
and talk to Mr. Thayer.

44:26.840 --> 44:28.140
Bullshit!

44:28.240 --> 44:30.380
Dad, I'm not going in there
with that old turkey man.

44:30.480 --> 44:31.900
He gives me the creeps.

44:32.000 --> 44:33.889
What if he dies?

44:35.440 --> 44:37.020
Now listen to me.

44:37.120 --> 44:38.500
If you don't start behaving yourself,

44:38.600 --> 44:39.980
I'm gonna send you
right back to your mother.

44:40.080 --> 44:43.050
Do you understand that?
Is that what you want?

44:45.160 --> 44:46.580
Now go back in there and talk to him.

44:46.680 --> 44:48.523
Maybe you'll learn something.

44:50.280 --> 44:52.408
Go on, go on.

45:04.080 --> 45:07.700
Remember when I was nine years old
and I came down

45:07.800 --> 45:09.460
and caught you and Norman
skinny-dipping?

45:09.560 --> 45:11.740
No, I don't remember that.

45:11.840 --> 45:13.820
Don't you remember I had that big light?

45:13.920 --> 45:16.940
I shined it on Norman on the
diving board and he was all naked!

45:17.040 --> 45:19.580
And he screamed at me,
he called me a spy

45:19.680 --> 45:21.940
and sent me to my room
for the rest of the year.

45:22.040 --> 45:23.780
Oh, it took me so long to get over that.

45:23.880 --> 45:25.220
It took Norman a long time

45:25.320 --> 45:28.260
before he'd go skinny-dipping again.

45:28.360 --> 45:30.180
He wouldn't even get out of the water

45:30.280 --> 45:34.060
until I went up and made sure
that you were asleep.

45:34.160 --> 45:37.300
I was so bloody mad at him
for yelling at you

45:37.400 --> 45:39.500
that I let him float around down here

45:39.600 --> 45:42.460
for an hour or so, freezing to death.

45:42.560 --> 45:44.130
Good!

45:46.400 --> 45:49.580
You going skinny-dipping?

45:49.680 --> 45:51.820
Are you going skinny-dipping?

45:51.920 --> 45:53.604
Nah. You?

45:57.720 --> 46:01.060
Nah, I try to be selective

46:01.160 --> 46:04.180
about who I flash in front of, you know?

46:11.720 --> 46:14.260
Chelsea says you're
a real heavy-duty fisherman.

46:14.360 --> 46:17.900
She calls you the old man of the sea.

46:18.000 --> 46:20.367
I've caught a few.

46:22.160 --> 46:24.380
You fish?

46:24.480 --> 46:26.767
Nah.

46:28.560 --> 46:30.580
What do you do out there in California?

46:30.680 --> 46:31.940
I mean...

46:32.040 --> 46:34.500
what does one do for recreation

46:34.600 --> 46:37.888
when one is 13 and not in school?

46:39.320 --> 46:42.460
We... cruise chicks.

46:44.080 --> 46:47.380
Cruise chicks.
You know, meet 'em... girls.

46:47.480 --> 46:50.140
Try to pick them up.

46:50.240 --> 46:53.260
What do you do with them
when you have them?

46:53.360 --> 46:56.140
Suck face.

46:56.240 --> 46:58.500
I beg your pardon?

46:58.600 --> 47:00.140
You know, kiss.

47:00.240 --> 47:01.890
Suck face, you kiss.

47:06.080 --> 47:07.620
Ever read this book, Treasure island?

47:07.720 --> 47:09.140
No.

47:09.240 --> 47:12.420
- Go read it.
- Now?

47:12.520 --> 47:14.060
Come on, take it upstairs!
Read the first chapter.

47:14.160 --> 47:16.322
Give me a report in the morning.

47:19.480 --> 47:21.540
I thought you said we were gonna
have a party here, though.

47:21.640 --> 47:23.940
I'll call you
when the party's under way,

47:24.040 --> 47:25.060
if it ever is.

47:25.160 --> 47:26.127
Go on!

47:39.400 --> 47:41.971
Oh, I'm sorry.

47:43.600 --> 47:44.820
Chelsea's still in the water.

47:44.920 --> 47:46.220
You should go on down.

47:46.320 --> 47:49.881
No one should skinny-dip alone.

47:51.960 --> 47:53.100
Yes?

47:53.200 --> 47:56.602
What... what is that over there?

47:58.240 --> 48:00.686
Well, that's a lawn chair.

48:06.080 --> 48:08.100
Go on.
Right down the path.

48:08.200 --> 48:10.931
Right.
See you later.

48:20.320 --> 48:23.020
I thought you'd be nude.

48:23.120 --> 48:25.300
No, sorry.

48:25.400 --> 48:29.180
I didn't want to overwhelm
our guest on his first night.

48:29.280 --> 48:31.460
He's nice, isn't he?

48:31.560 --> 48:33.980
- $40 a filling.
- $40!

48:34.080 --> 48:36.980
That's enough to keep you off sweets.

48:37.080 --> 48:39.260
He'd be a good catch, wouldn't he?

48:39.360 --> 48:41.900
He said they wanted to sleep together.

48:42.000 --> 48:44.140
Well, why not?
They're big people.

48:44.240 --> 48:45.730
Yeah.

48:47.720 --> 48:50.100
You and I did, didn't we?

48:50.200 --> 48:51.740
Did we?

48:51.840 --> 48:55.340
Oh, Norman...

48:55.440 --> 48:57.140
have you been picking on him?

48:57.240 --> 49:00.483
Yeah. He finds me fascinating.

49:01.840 --> 49:03.683
Well, why not?

49:05.080 --> 49:07.321
Norman...

49:08.920 --> 49:11.180
Norman.

49:11.280 --> 49:13.220
Chelsea... wants us

49:13.320 --> 49:17.100
to do something for her.

49:17.200 --> 49:22.460
She wants to leave Billy here
with us for a month.

49:22.560 --> 49:25.500
- Which Billy?
- Oh, Billy, Norman!

49:25.600 --> 49:26.820
The little one.

49:26.920 --> 49:29.620
Bill is supposed to have him
for the summer,

49:29.720 --> 49:32.740
and the kid would be
miserable in Europe.

49:32.840 --> 49:35.140
Bill seems very nice,

49:35.240 --> 49:37.620
and Chels needs someone nice.

49:37.720 --> 49:39.620
Couldn't we do that for her?

49:39.720 --> 49:41.340
What would we do with the boy?

49:41.440 --> 49:42.980
What would I say to him?

49:43.080 --> 49:45.100
You'd think of something.

49:45.200 --> 49:46.340
Let's do it.

49:46.440 --> 49:50.809
Let's say we'll do it and give Chelsea
some happiness, yes?

49:52.520 --> 49:53.940
All right.

49:54.040 --> 49:57.020
We'll have a splendid time,
the three of us, won't we?

49:57.120 --> 50:00.060
I don't know.
We might.

50:00.160 --> 50:02.220
You know, Norman...

50:02.320 --> 50:06.260
you really are the sweetest man
in the world,

50:06.360 --> 50:08.567
but I'm the only one who knows it.

50:10.600 --> 50:15.447
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

50:19.880 --> 50:22.580

50:22.680 --> 50:25.900

50:35.120 --> 50:37.220
Beautiful.

50:37.320 --> 50:41.140
I suppose you expect me
to sing something now.

50:41.240 --> 50:43.940
I'm not about to.

50:44.040 --> 50:47.220
I've been trying all day to draw some...

50:47.320 --> 50:51.780
profound conclusion
about living fourscore years.

50:51.880 --> 50:54.100
Haven't thought of anything.

50:54.200 --> 50:57.420
I'm surprised it got here so fast.

50:57.520 --> 51:00.380
But I'm glad I got to spend so much time

51:00.480 --> 51:01.860
with this beautiful woman.

51:01.960 --> 51:04.060
What's your name again?

51:04.160 --> 51:05.780
I want to thank all of you

51:05.880 --> 51:08.300
for coming all the way here
from Disneyland

51:08.400 --> 51:12.007
to witness this historic event.

51:13.360 --> 51:14.860
Now that I'm out of hot air,

51:14.960 --> 51:18.060
I'm gonna need a little assistance
to get these candles out.

51:18.160 --> 51:20.003
Come on, everybody.

51:43.680 --> 51:45.100
Come on!

51:45.200 --> 51:46.565
Chicken.

51:58.640 --> 52:00.927
Charlie!

52:07.440 --> 52:10.060
Well, holy mackinoly!

52:10.160 --> 52:11.780
Chelsea mackinelsie.

52:11.880 --> 52:14.020
Charlie mackinolly.

52:14.120 --> 52:16.380
Boy, it's good to see you.

52:16.480 --> 52:18.380
Well, you've held up good!

52:18.480 --> 52:20.980
Thanks, so have you.

52:21.080 --> 52:23.380
Bill, this is my old friend Charlie.

52:23.480 --> 52:24.780
He's the mailman.

52:24.880 --> 52:27.220
Hi, how are you?

52:27.320 --> 52:29.260
Hello.

52:29.360 --> 52:30.380
Want a ride?

52:30.480 --> 52:32.767
I'd love one.

52:46.920 --> 52:49.300
Great.

52:49.400 --> 52:51.580
You actually deliver the mail
in a boat?

52:51.680 --> 52:54.180
What an incredible tradition.

52:54.280 --> 52:56.460
Charlie's a legend on this lake.

52:56.560 --> 52:58.700
He gets the mail through,
no matter what.

52:58.800 --> 53:01.660
- Isn't that right, Charlie?
- Yeah, guess so.

53:01.760 --> 53:03.220
Must be a bitch in the winter?

53:03.320 --> 53:06.420
Yeah, in the winter
I have a hell of a time.

53:06.520 --> 53:08.500
Of course, there's nobody
on the lake to deliver to,

53:08.600 --> 53:10.807
so I get done a lot faster.

53:12.560 --> 53:14.140
You've got great setup, here.

53:14.240 --> 53:15.660
You're a lucky man.

53:15.760 --> 53:17.649
You're a lucky man, too.

53:18.880 --> 53:20.530
Yeah, I guess I am.

53:22.600 --> 53:24.460
What...

53:24.560 --> 53:26.820
what would you usually do
at a time like this?

53:26.920 --> 53:29.340
Well, generally I just fall
into the lake.

53:29.440 --> 53:31.966
Just...

53:44.760 --> 53:46.060
All right, come on, Dad.

53:46.160 --> 53:47.260
Big rolls here.
You can beat him.

53:47.360 --> 53:49.620
- All right.
- Big rolls.

53:49.720 --> 53:52.100
- All right!
- Two threes. What does that mean?

53:52.200 --> 53:55.500
It means doubles, which always means
you get 14, you see?

53:55.600 --> 53:58.780
You send me home,
you get 20 more, for God's sake.

53:58.880 --> 54:00.220
All right, Dadder!

54:00.320 --> 54:02.300
- Good, huh?
- Excellent!

54:02.400 --> 54:03.780
You're a natural.

54:03.880 --> 54:06.300
Starting to regret
teaching you this game.

54:06.400 --> 54:09.060
Chels. Hey, Chels,
Parcheesi pro.

54:09.160 --> 54:11.500
Chelsea doesn't like playing games.

54:11.600 --> 54:14.900
We don't know why.
Probably doesn't like losing.

54:15.000 --> 54:17.620
I tend to panic when the competition
gets too intense.

54:17.720 --> 54:19.100
What's that supposed mean?

54:19.200 --> 54:20.340
Nothing.

54:20.440 --> 54:23.220
We play serious Parcheesi around here.

54:23.320 --> 54:25.220
I let Norman win every week or so,

54:25.320 --> 54:28.540
just to keep his spirits up.

54:28.640 --> 54:31.100
What I'd like to know
is why you enjoy playing games.

54:32.480 --> 54:35.020
You seem to like beating people.

54:35.120 --> 54:36.565
I wonder why?

54:43.440 --> 54:45.841
You get another chance, Bill.
Another roll of the dice.

55:15.520 --> 55:18.490
Well, here's my little early bird.

55:22.400 --> 55:25.820
Are you having fun?

55:25.920 --> 55:28.260
That's why you come to camp, you know.

55:28.360 --> 55:29.885
To have fun.

55:33.400 --> 55:35.860
What's the matter, darling?

55:35.960 --> 55:37.325
Nothing.

55:41.080 --> 55:43.082
I don't think I've ever grown up
on Golden Pond.

55:44.840 --> 55:46.860
Do you understand?

55:46.960 --> 55:50.020
No. No, I don't think I understand.

55:50.120 --> 55:52.043
It doesn't matter.

55:54.240 --> 55:58.020
I act like a big person everywhere else.

55:58.120 --> 56:01.100
I'm in charge of Los Angeles
and I come here,

56:01.200 --> 56:03.567
I feel like a little fat girl.

56:05.200 --> 56:07.680
That's just because
your father said that.

56:09.480 --> 56:11.900
My father is a goddamn bastard.

56:12.000 --> 56:13.780
Come on, Chels.

56:13.880 --> 56:15.980
- Watch your language.
- Poop.

56:16.080 --> 56:19.300
Why, you going to wash
my mouth out with soap?

56:19.400 --> 56:21.767
That was rather a bizarre custom.

56:24.440 --> 56:27.540
Mother, do you know...

56:27.640 --> 56:30.820
I've been answering
to Norman all my life.

56:30.920 --> 56:32.140
Makes me so mad.

56:32.240 --> 56:35.580
Even when I'm 3,000 miles away
and I don't even see him,

56:35.680 --> 56:38.365
I'm still answering to him.

56:39.400 --> 56:42.020
Norman is a goddamn poop.

56:42.120 --> 56:44.660
Oh, for the Lord's sake,
here we go again.

56:44.760 --> 56:46.620
You had a miserable childhood.

56:46.720 --> 56:49.380
Your father was overbearing,
your mother ignored you.

56:49.480 --> 56:51.130
What else is new?

56:53.760 --> 56:55.683
Chelsea...

56:58.200 --> 57:02.060
you have a great big chip
on your shoulder,

57:02.160 --> 57:05.243
which is very unattractive.

57:06.280 --> 57:07.380
It is. It is.

57:07.480 --> 57:09.540
You stay away for years at a time.

57:09.640 --> 57:11.500
You never come home unless I beg you to.

57:11.600 --> 57:13.780
And then when you do, all you can do

57:13.880 --> 57:16.060
is be disagreeable about the past.

57:16.160 --> 57:17.540
What's the point?

57:17.640 --> 57:19.700
Don't you think that...

57:19.800 --> 57:22.180
everyone looks back on their childhood

57:22.280 --> 57:26.140
with a certain amount of bitterness
and regret about something?

57:26.240 --> 57:29.540
It doesn't have to ruin
your life, darling.

57:29.640 --> 57:32.140
You're a big girl now.

57:32.240 --> 57:34.740
Aren't you tired of it all?

57:34.840 --> 57:38.580
Bore, bore, bore.

57:38.680 --> 57:41.081
Life marches by, Chels.

57:42.840 --> 57:45.844
I suggest you get on with it.

58:09.040 --> 58:12.180
Have a wonderful trip, darling.
And don't worry.

58:12.280 --> 58:13.660
Billy will take good care of us.

58:13.760 --> 58:15.460
Okay.

58:15.560 --> 58:17.940
Don't go getting involved
with any foreigners.

58:18.040 --> 58:20.620
Right.

58:20.720 --> 58:22.260
Let me have your bag, Chels.

58:22.360 --> 58:24.203
Good-bye, kid.

58:25.760 --> 58:27.380
Okay.

58:27.480 --> 58:28.460
You going to be okay now?

58:28.560 --> 58:29.820
Oh, sure.

58:29.920 --> 58:31.700
- Behave yourself.
- Yeah. Hey, listen.

58:31.800 --> 58:33.220
You guys behave yourself too, now.

58:33.320 --> 58:36.220
We will, okay.
Norman, bye.

58:36.320 --> 58:37.685
You work on that Parcheesi game.

58:38.840 --> 58:40.420
Good luck, everybody.

58:40.520 --> 58:42.460
Ethel, thank you so much.
We had a great time.

58:42.560 --> 58:47.060
Thank you.
I'm so happy you came.

58:47.160 --> 58:48.366
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

59:05.880 --> 59:07.580
Just want you guys to know

59:07.680 --> 59:09.887
that I'm not about to take
any crap from you.

59:25.120 --> 59:27.180
Well, gentlemen,

59:27.280 --> 59:30.020
it's a beautiful day.

59:30.120 --> 59:31.700
We're going fishing.

59:31.800 --> 59:33.740
What?
We're going what?

59:33.840 --> 59:36.420
Fishing.
You remember fishing, Norman.

59:36.520 --> 59:40.980
You're going to show Billy
what life is all about on Golden Pond.

59:41.080 --> 59:43.220
Come on, Billy.

59:43.320 --> 59:46.100
Bullshit.

59:46.200 --> 59:48.620
I beg your pardon?

59:48.720 --> 59:50.660
Does that mean you can't wait
to get out there

59:50.760 --> 59:53.540
or that it's not your cup of tea?

59:53.640 --> 59:56.380
It's bullshit.
That's all.

59:56.480 --> 59:59.220
I see. Well, come on,
Norman.

59:59.320 --> 01:00:01.846
Let's get ready.

01:00:07.200 --> 01:00:09.180
You like that word, don't you?

01:00:09.280 --> 01:00:10.740
Bullshit.

01:00:10.840 --> 01:00:13.620
Yeah.

01:00:13.720 --> 01:00:16.291
It's a good word.

01:00:24.160 --> 01:00:26.288
Okay, Grandpa, do your stuff.

01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:30.860
Hey, hey!

01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:32.780
Pretty slick, huh?

01:00:32.880 --> 01:00:34.900
Look at this.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:38.180
This was Chelsea's
when she was about your age.

01:00:38.280 --> 01:00:41.540
She caught some respectable fish
wearing this.

01:00:41.640 --> 01:00:43.768
I'm surprised you still kept it
if it's Chelsea's.

01:00:48.480 --> 01:00:51.620
I might not stick around here.

01:00:51.720 --> 01:00:56.100
I might just haul my ass
out to Wyoming or Puerto Rico.

01:00:56.200 --> 01:00:57.645
One of those places.

01:00:59.760 --> 01:01:03.980
Listen, I know
I'm just being dumped here.

01:01:04.080 --> 01:01:06.100
Which is like my middle name.

01:01:06.200 --> 01:01:08.260
You turkeys don't want me.

01:01:08.360 --> 01:01:10.260
Bullshit.

01:01:10.360 --> 01:01:12.540
I'm 67 years older than you.

01:01:12.640 --> 01:01:16.020
How do you know what I want?

01:01:16.120 --> 01:01:19.300
We're going fishing now.

01:01:19.400 --> 01:01:21.180
We want you to go along.

01:01:21.280 --> 01:01:24.020
If you want to come with us, I suggest

01:01:24.120 --> 01:01:27.140
you get your ass down to the dock
in two minutes.

01:01:27.240 --> 01:01:29.607
Okay, Miss Turkey, let's go.

01:01:42.040 --> 01:01:44.042
Here he is.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:55.340
I...

01:01:55.440 --> 01:01:57.540
I thought I might just sorta come along

01:01:57.640 --> 01:02:01.087
and see what this bullshit is all about.

01:02:02.440 --> 01:02:03.820
Get in.

01:02:03.920 --> 01:02:06.540
You look very handsome
in that fishing vest.

01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:07.860
Oh, thank you!

01:02:07.960 --> 01:02:11.567
I mean... thank you.

01:02:15.600 --> 01:02:18.524
So, how fast does
this old tub go anyway?

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:31.004
All right!

01:03:29.840 --> 01:03:31.220
Go up this time.

01:03:31.320 --> 01:03:33.288
Not just back.
Up and back, come on.

01:03:39.440 --> 01:03:41.100
Come on, nothing to be afraid of.

01:03:41.200 --> 01:03:43.460
Backflip's one of the easiest dives.

01:03:43.560 --> 01:03:46.700
Oh, yeah? Then why don't
you come and try it?

01:03:46.800 --> 01:03:50.340
Norman, you stay right where you are.

01:03:50.440 --> 01:03:52.841
Dive, boy.

01:03:56.400 --> 01:03:57.740
All right.

01:03:57.840 --> 01:03:58.940
One...

01:03:59.040 --> 01:04:00.060
two...

01:04:00.160 --> 01:04:01.321
three!

01:04:05.040 --> 01:04:06.340
Ouch!

01:04:06.440 --> 01:04:08.700
Good God!

01:04:08.800 --> 01:04:09.820
That wasn't it.

01:04:09.920 --> 01:04:11.540
Thanks for telling me.

01:04:11.640 --> 01:04:13.700
Norman, we've got him for a whole month.

01:04:13.800 --> 01:04:15.768
Don't kill him the first week.

01:04:41.680 --> 01:04:43.220
This is it?

01:04:43.320 --> 01:04:45.926
This is it.

01:05:01.040 --> 01:05:03.122
Give me your hook.

01:05:05.640 --> 01:05:10.940
You got to be patient
when you're fishing for trout, boy.

01:05:11.040 --> 01:05:13.140
There's a trout living in this cove

01:05:13.240 --> 01:05:15.580
that weighs 10 pounds
if he weighs an ounce.

01:05:15.680 --> 01:05:19.580
First saw him three or four years ago.

01:05:19.680 --> 01:05:23.980
Hooked him two years ago
and again last year.

01:05:24.080 --> 01:05:26.820
But he's a crafty old son of a bitch!

01:05:26.920 --> 01:05:28.684
It's your last chance, Walter!

01:05:31.120 --> 01:05:33.540
Called him Walter 'cause
he reminds me of Ethel's brother.

01:05:33.640 --> 01:05:35.620
He's fat, lazy, and ugly!

01:05:35.720 --> 01:05:37.688
Okay.
Throw her out.

01:05:45.120 --> 01:05:47.487
Let her out.
Thread your line.

01:05:51.520 --> 01:05:53.340
How is your line?

01:05:53.440 --> 01:05:54.420
On the bottom?

01:05:54.520 --> 01:05:56.100
If your line's floating,
it's on the bottom!

01:05:56.200 --> 01:05:57.580
That doesn't do you any good.
Bring it up!

01:05:57.680 --> 01:06:00.060
Bring it up, for Christ's sake!

01:06:00.160 --> 01:06:01.860
All right!

01:06:01.960 --> 01:06:04.580
Hey, man, you don't have to yell at me.

01:06:04.680 --> 01:06:06.060
Who do you think you are, anyway?

01:06:06.160 --> 01:06:08.162
Long John Silver?

01:06:11.040 --> 01:06:14.140
God.

01:06:14.240 --> 01:06:16.447
I'm sorry.

01:06:20.200 --> 01:06:22.407
That's okay.

01:06:35.560 --> 01:06:37.130
Having fun?

01:06:39.120 --> 01:06:40.140
Yeah.

01:06:40.240 --> 01:06:43.660
That's good.

01:06:43.760 --> 01:06:47.500
Better than cruising chicks, isn't it?

01:06:47.600 --> 01:06:49.180
No.

01:06:49.280 --> 01:06:52.090
I suppose not.

01:07:02.760 --> 01:07:04.500
For God's sake!

01:07:04.600 --> 01:07:06.860
What the hell are you doing out here?

01:07:06.960 --> 01:07:09.820
Brought you lunch!

01:07:09.920 --> 01:07:11.180
How the hell did you find us?

01:07:11.280 --> 01:07:13.940
You'll scare the fish.

01:07:14.040 --> 01:07:16.820
Ethel, this is supposed to be
a secret fishing place.

01:07:16.920 --> 01:07:18.260
Lucky guess.

01:07:18.360 --> 01:07:19.860
We don't need any lunch!

01:07:19.960 --> 01:07:21.420
We got more important things
going on here.

01:07:21.520 --> 01:07:23.700
Don't be an old poop.

01:07:23.800 --> 01:07:25.802
Billy might get hungry.

01:07:29.600 --> 01:07:31.443
Bye-bye.

01:07:51.720 --> 01:07:54.849
We ought to see what she brought us.

01:08:12.320 --> 01:08:14.540
Hold on, you son of bitch!

01:08:14.640 --> 01:08:15.780
What? What?

01:08:15.880 --> 01:08:18.260
Run with it!

01:08:18.359 --> 01:08:21.420
It's not Walter, but he's related.

01:08:21.520 --> 01:08:23.340
You ugly old son of a bitch!

01:08:23.439 --> 01:08:26.540
- San Frantastic!
- I love you, I love you!

01:08:26.640 --> 01:08:27.580
Get the net, boy.

01:08:27.680 --> 01:08:29.648
We're going to have trout
for dinner tonight!

01:08:33.359 --> 01:08:35.140
Not the little one, the big one!
It's in back of me.

01:08:35.240 --> 01:08:37.560
It ain't no stupid sunfish!

01:08:39.160 --> 01:08:41.100
Here you go, baby.

01:08:41.200 --> 01:08:43.180
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

01:08:43.279 --> 01:08:44.899
Oh, lovely!

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.540
Get the net down underneath him.

01:08:47.640 --> 01:08:49.540
Lovely.
Bring it up.

01:08:49.640 --> 01:08:51.660
Oh, wow!

01:08:51.760 --> 01:08:53.500
Look at that beauty.

01:08:53.600 --> 01:08:55.283
Yes, siree.

01:08:57.240 --> 01:08:58.540
This...

01:08:58.640 --> 01:09:00.180
is a trout.

01:09:00.279 --> 01:09:01.819
A rainbow trout.

01:09:01.920 --> 01:09:03.365
Get going, boy!

01:09:08.680 --> 01:09:10.460
Norman, we've caught eight million fish.

01:09:10.560 --> 01:09:12.779
Are you sure none of these is Walter?

01:09:12.880 --> 01:09:15.700
Yep, Walter is humongous.

01:09:15.800 --> 01:09:17.779
Those fish you got there
are little mothers.

01:09:17.880 --> 01:09:20.580
They're disgusting little mothers.

01:09:20.680 --> 01:09:22.859
You got something
against fish guts, boy?

01:09:22.960 --> 01:09:24.819
Yeech!

01:09:24.920 --> 01:09:26.819
Hey Norman, can I ask you something?

01:09:26.920 --> 01:09:28.460
How did you get Ethel anyway?

01:09:28.560 --> 01:09:30.300
What?

01:09:30.399 --> 01:09:31.620
I sent away for her.

01:09:31.720 --> 01:09:33.300
Two box tops from Quaker Oats.

01:09:33.399 --> 01:09:37.140
Come on, don't bullshit me, man.

01:09:37.240 --> 01:09:39.580
I met Ethel when I was a principal

01:09:39.680 --> 01:09:42.380
and she was a substitute teacher.

01:09:42.479 --> 01:09:44.300
She was the prettiest thing
I'd ever seen.

01:09:44.399 --> 01:09:48.220
So I told her she made
my heart go pitter-pat.

01:09:48.319 --> 01:09:51.899
She fell in love with me immediately.

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:53.300
Is that the way Norman got you, Ethel?

01:09:53.399 --> 01:09:55.340
Don't be silly, he didn't get me at all.

01:09:55.440 --> 01:09:57.761
I won him in a contest.
He was the booby prize.

01:09:59.720 --> 01:10:02.420
Has he got you you cleaning
those stupid fish?

01:10:02.520 --> 01:10:04.180
That's right, he cleans the stupid ones,

01:10:04.280 --> 01:10:06.340
I clean the smart ones.

01:10:06.440 --> 01:10:09.340
Fortunately, the smart ones
are too smart to get caught.

01:10:09.440 --> 01:10:12.180
That's why they're in schools.

01:10:12.280 --> 01:10:14.740
Come on in, Norman.
Get me a fire going.

01:10:14.840 --> 01:10:16.900
It's going to be a bit nippy tonight.

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.740
You hear that, boy?
Get a fire going.

01:10:19.840 --> 01:10:21.460
Norman, for Pete's sake!

01:10:21.560 --> 01:10:24.700
Billy doesn't have to do
all your chores.

01:10:24.800 --> 01:10:28.600
What's the point in having a dwarf
if he doesn't do chores?

01:10:38.480 --> 01:10:40.100
Damn!

01:10:40.200 --> 01:10:43.060
You got the match backwards.
Want me to do it?

01:10:43.160 --> 01:10:46.050
I think I know how to light a fire,
for Christ's sake.

01:11:20.640 --> 01:11:22.860
What are you reading?

01:11:22.960 --> 01:11:25.260
A Tale of Two Cities.

01:11:25.360 --> 01:11:27.740
Ah, très bien, très bien!

01:11:27.840 --> 01:11:29.580
Norman! Norman!

01:11:29.680 --> 01:11:31.660
You've set the house on fire!

01:11:31.760 --> 01:11:33.740
- What the hell's going on?
- Get a bucket!

01:11:33.840 --> 01:11:35.524
- What?
- Get a bucket!

01:11:45.200 --> 01:11:47.300
Good for you, Billy.
Good for you.

01:11:47.400 --> 01:11:48.780
Let's have the screen.

01:11:48.880 --> 01:11:50.860
The screen.

01:11:50.960 --> 01:11:53.220
- It's warm.
- Yep. Right there.

01:11:53.320 --> 01:11:56.900
That's all right.

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.980
For God's sake!
You made a hell of a mess!

01:12:00.080 --> 01:12:01.020
What?

01:12:01.120 --> 01:12:02.940
Norman, he just...

01:12:03.040 --> 01:12:05.327
don't yell at me, man.

01:12:08.200 --> 01:12:10.100
I guess it's...

01:12:10.200 --> 01:12:13.204
not safe to have me around here, is it?

01:12:15.120 --> 01:12:19.170
What are you staring at me for,
you little son of a bitch?

01:12:39.720 --> 01:12:43.220
You mustn't let Norman upset you, Billy.

01:12:43.320 --> 01:12:44.940
Sure.

01:12:45.040 --> 01:12:47.220
He wasn't yelling at you, you know.

01:12:47.320 --> 01:12:49.220
Sounds like he is yelling at me.

01:12:49.320 --> 01:12:52.940
No, he was yelling at life.

01:12:53.040 --> 01:12:54.780
What the heck does that mean?

01:12:54.880 --> 01:12:56.660
It means he's like an old lion.

01:12:56.760 --> 01:12:59.969
He has to remind himself
that he can still roar.

01:13:05.080 --> 01:13:07.420
Billy...

01:13:07.520 --> 01:13:09.820
sometimes...

01:13:09.920 --> 01:13:13.900
you have to look hard at a person

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:15.940
and remember...

01:13:16.040 --> 01:13:18.008
that he's doing the best he can.

01:13:20.480 --> 01:13:24.460
He's just trying to find his way,
that's all.

01:13:24.560 --> 01:13:28.451
Just like you.

01:14:15.320 --> 01:14:17.420
How's my little petunia?

01:14:17.520 --> 01:14:19.620
Hey, Norman!

01:14:19.720 --> 01:14:22.180
Norman!

01:14:22.280 --> 01:14:23.420
Hey, Norm!

01:14:23.520 --> 01:14:25.180
Yeah, listen, I was wondering,

01:14:25.280 --> 01:14:28.020
can I take the Thayer IV
for a little spin?

01:14:28.120 --> 01:14:29.420
Absolutely not!

01:14:29.520 --> 01:14:31.740
Aw, come on.
I know how to drive.

01:14:31.840 --> 01:14:34.620
I think it would be all right.
Don't you, Norman?

01:14:34.720 --> 01:14:36.380
Good God!

01:14:36.480 --> 01:14:38.060
Can you be careful?

01:14:38.160 --> 01:14:40.925
Oh, sure.

01:14:54.880 --> 01:14:58.260
Norman, what the hell are you doing?

01:14:58.360 --> 01:15:01.140
- Ruff!
- Come on.

01:15:01.240 --> 01:15:02.780
It's really happened, hasn't it?

01:15:02.880 --> 01:15:06.123
You have lost your marbles.

01:16:01.280 --> 01:16:03.780
Here.
I'll get the big net.

01:16:03.880 --> 01:16:05.860
You two will be sorry.

01:16:05.960 --> 01:16:09.140
The loons have been calling
for rain all night long.

01:16:09.240 --> 01:16:10.940
"Rain! Rain!

01:16:11.040 --> 01:16:14.020
Bring us some rain!"

01:16:14.120 --> 01:16:15.540
That's what the loons said, huh?

01:16:15.640 --> 01:16:16.740
Allons, debut.

01:16:16.840 --> 01:16:18.540
Je viens.

01:16:18.640 --> 01:16:21.300
That's French, you know.
It means, "I'm coming."

01:16:21.400 --> 01:16:23.220
I'll get la port.

01:16:23.320 --> 01:16:25.580
Oh, no, no, no!

01:16:25.680 --> 01:16:26.940
I'm sorry.

01:16:27.040 --> 01:16:29.740
Ethel, allow me.

01:16:29.840 --> 01:16:32.860
I don't believe it!

01:16:32.960 --> 01:16:34.580
Yeah.

01:16:34.680 --> 01:16:37.620
Norman and I fixed the mother.

01:16:37.720 --> 01:16:39.484
Oh, great!

01:17:01.880 --> 01:17:03.300
That's the only place
that we haven't looked

01:17:03.400 --> 01:17:06.620
for this stupid son-of-a-bitch fish.

01:17:06.720 --> 01:17:08.980
Might as well give it a try, huh?

01:17:09.080 --> 01:17:12.340
They call this Purgatory Cove, boy.

01:17:12.440 --> 01:17:13.740
See those rocks?

01:17:13.840 --> 01:17:15.780
They eat boats.

01:17:15.880 --> 01:17:16.940
Do you know the way?

01:17:17.040 --> 01:17:19.340
Of course I know the way.

01:17:19.440 --> 01:17:20.540
Get up on the deck.

01:17:20.640 --> 01:17:23.540
Tell me where the rocks are.

01:17:23.640 --> 01:17:25.608
Come on, up there.

01:17:32.880 --> 01:17:34.220
All right?

01:17:34.320 --> 01:17:35.890
- Okay.
- Here we go.

01:17:39.160 --> 01:17:40.220
Hey, there's one coming up.

01:17:40.320 --> 01:17:41.820
- Which side?
- On the left.

01:17:41.920 --> 01:17:43.524
- Port, boy.
- Okay, port.

01:17:46.080 --> 01:17:47.380
All right.

01:17:47.480 --> 01:17:50.940
Another one on port.

01:17:51.040 --> 01:17:52.700
Oh, there's one coming up right here.

01:17:52.800 --> 01:17:55.610
Oh, shit.
The starboard.

01:18:04.840 --> 01:18:08.660
Okay, there's one port side.

01:18:08.760 --> 01:18:10.922
All right, starboard, over there.

01:18:44.560 --> 01:18:47.860
Now... doesn't this look like
the ideal hiding place

01:18:47.960 --> 01:18:49.962
for a crafty old son of a bitch?

01:18:54.440 --> 01:18:56.980
Well, the fish aren't just gonna
jump in the boat, you know.

01:18:57.080 --> 01:18:58.491
Get it in gear, turkey!

01:19:29.440 --> 01:19:32.250
Getting dark, Chelsea.

01:19:34.400 --> 01:19:36.700
Who are you calling Chelsea?

01:19:36.800 --> 01:19:39.020
I'm Billy, remember?

01:19:39.120 --> 01:19:42.540
Come on, man.

01:19:42.640 --> 01:19:44.180
Hey, are you okay?

01:19:44.280 --> 01:19:46.660
'Course I'm okay!

01:19:46.760 --> 01:19:48.524
Okay.

01:19:51.880 --> 01:19:54.460
We better hurry and catch Walter, huh?

01:19:54.560 --> 01:19:57.180
I mean, I'm not gonna
be here much longer.

01:19:57.280 --> 01:19:59.760
Neither am I.

01:20:05.720 --> 01:20:08.340
I'll miss you, Norman.

01:20:08.440 --> 01:20:09.566
What?

01:20:22.240 --> 01:20:24.540
Norman!
Hey, Norman, look! Shit!

01:20:24.640 --> 01:20:25.740
I got the mother!

01:20:25.840 --> 01:20:29.060
I got him!

01:20:29.160 --> 01:20:30.540
Well, get the net, Norman!

01:20:30.640 --> 01:20:33.580
Get it in gear, turkey!

01:20:33.680 --> 01:20:35.364
I got him!

01:20:37.240 --> 01:20:39.811
What the heck is that?

01:20:42.680 --> 01:20:44.409
My God!

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.820
It's a dead loon, Norman.

01:20:50.920 --> 01:20:53.180
The poor thing.

01:20:53.280 --> 01:20:54.740
Oh, it smells, too.

01:20:54.840 --> 01:20:57.002
Here. Hold on.

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:05.006
Let it go.

01:21:46.320 --> 01:21:47.890
Hey, Norman?

01:21:49.960 --> 01:21:52.460
Are you afraid of dying?

01:21:52.560 --> 01:21:54.820
What?

01:21:54.920 --> 01:21:56.340
Are you afraid to die?

01:21:56.440 --> 01:21:59.284
What the hell kind of question is that?

01:22:00.760 --> 01:22:03.220
I was just wondering, that's all.

01:22:03.320 --> 01:22:04.780
I don't know...

01:22:04.880 --> 01:22:09.660
why everybody has to talk
about everything all the time.

01:22:09.760 --> 01:22:11.660
Let's go home, boy.

01:22:11.760 --> 01:22:14.660
Are you sure we're gonna be able
to get out of here?

01:22:14.760 --> 01:22:17.809
'Course we can.
Pull up the anchor.

01:22:27.200 --> 01:22:29.123
Get up on deck.

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.020
Hey, get back here.

01:22:37.120 --> 01:22:38.820
I forgot you're a hotshot boat driver.

01:22:38.920 --> 01:22:41.140
Here, you take the wheel
and I'll navigate.

01:22:41.240 --> 01:22:42.980
Yeah?

01:22:43.080 --> 01:22:45.460
Well, you know,
I'm not afraid to do this.

01:22:45.560 --> 01:22:48.380
I know. Just...
take us real slow.

01:22:48.480 --> 01:22:51.927
Do what I tell you.

01:22:57.240 --> 01:22:59.322
Okay, turn it over.

01:23:00.760 --> 01:23:02.980
All right.
Take it forward.

01:23:03.080 --> 01:23:05.970
Now give her a hard left.

01:23:17.400 --> 01:23:18.740
Okay.

01:23:18.840 --> 01:23:21.060
Port.

01:23:21.160 --> 01:23:23.049
Okay, good.

01:23:26.800 --> 01:23:29.883
All right.
Starboard again.

01:23:46.600 --> 01:23:47.940
Okay.

01:23:48.040 --> 01:23:51.900
Port.
To the left.

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:53.500
Good God!
Reverse!

01:23:53.600 --> 01:23:56.460
Full throttle, reverse!

01:23:56.560 --> 01:23:58.420
- Reverse!
- Oh, God!

01:23:58.520 --> 01:23:59.885
Reverse!

01:24:05.720 --> 01:24:07.060
Norman?

01:24:07.160 --> 01:24:08.685
Norman!

01:24:11.080 --> 01:24:13.820
Chels...
Chels...

01:24:13.920 --> 01:24:16.580
- Chels... oh!
- Norman!

01:24:16.680 --> 01:24:19.500
Norman!

01:24:19.600 --> 01:24:21.728
Norman, please!

01:24:24.720 --> 01:24:28.380
Oh, God, Norman!

01:24:28.480 --> 01:24:29.980
Oh, Norman, I'm sorry!

01:24:30.080 --> 01:24:32.048
I'm sorry!

01:24:35.080 --> 01:24:38.220
Hold on.

01:24:38.320 --> 01:24:40.607
I'm gonna bring you over here.

01:24:45.600 --> 01:24:46.580
Norman.

01:24:46.680 --> 01:24:48.842
Norman, grab on.

01:24:50.480 --> 01:24:52.608
Grab onto the rock.

01:24:54.520 --> 01:24:57.046
Grab onto the rock.

01:25:02.720 --> 01:25:04.165
I'm sorry.

01:25:05.960 --> 01:25:08.645
Billy!

01:25:10.040 --> 01:25:11.140
Come on now.

01:25:11.240 --> 01:25:14.084
Hold onto the rock.

01:25:39.920 --> 01:25:41.660
Oh, Charlie, thank God you're here!

01:25:41.760 --> 01:25:44.140
Come on! We're going for a ride!

01:25:44.240 --> 01:25:45.700
Norman and the kid are out on the lake.

01:25:45.800 --> 01:25:47.980
They should have been home hours ago.

01:25:48.080 --> 01:25:49.286
Hurry up.

01:25:53.240 --> 01:25:56.340
Norman isn't ever late.

01:25:56.440 --> 01:25:59.523
- I don't understand it.
- Oh, he'll be all right.

01:26:02.400 --> 01:26:04.780
Ethel, we've been back
and forth here three times.

01:26:04.880 --> 01:26:08.100
They must have pulled up somewhere.

01:26:08.200 --> 01:26:11.060
You don't suppose
he would've gone in there,

01:26:11.160 --> 01:26:12.340
do you, Charlie?

01:26:12.440 --> 01:26:14.820
He's not that crazy.

01:26:14.920 --> 01:26:16.340
Yes, he is.

01:26:16.440 --> 01:26:18.340
Let's go.

01:26:18.440 --> 01:26:20.580
I'm not gonna drive my boat
into Purgatory Cove.

01:26:20.680 --> 01:26:22.540
Yes, you are, Charlie.

01:26:22.640 --> 01:26:24.005
I'll point the way.

01:26:26.520 --> 01:26:28.140
Holy mackinoly.

01:26:28.240 --> 01:26:31.220
It's full of rocks, Charlie.
Look out.

01:26:31.320 --> 01:26:35.060
- To the left. Okay... Okay...
- Yeah. Yeah.

01:26:35.160 --> 01:26:36.700
- Am I all right?
- Okay, keep to the right.

01:26:36.800 --> 01:26:38.780
Keep to the right.

01:26:38.880 --> 01:26:43.140
- Keep to the right!
- All right, I am!

01:26:43.240 --> 01:26:45.180
That's better, that's better.
Okay.

01:26:45.280 --> 01:26:47.300
Straight ahead.

01:26:47.400 --> 01:26:48.660
See anything?

01:26:48.760 --> 01:26:51.540
- A lot of rocks here.
- Oh, Lordy.

01:26:51.640 --> 01:26:53.420
Norman Thayer, Jr.,

01:26:53.520 --> 01:26:56.444
where the hell are you?

01:26:59.080 --> 01:27:01.500
Charlie!
There they are, Charlie.

01:27:01.600 --> 01:27:04.490
Oh, my God!

01:27:16.880 --> 01:27:18.928
Norman!

01:27:25.400 --> 01:27:27.060
Ethel!

01:27:27.160 --> 01:27:30.020
You shouldn't be out here
this time of night.

01:27:30.120 --> 01:27:31.380
You poop!

01:27:31.480 --> 01:27:34.051
You goddamn poop!

01:27:57.360 --> 01:27:59.420
How are my boys?

01:27:59.520 --> 01:28:01.780
I'm off to the woods to find mushrooms

01:28:01.880 --> 01:28:03.660
or flowers or something.

01:28:03.760 --> 01:28:05.740
Are you gonna be all right?

01:28:05.840 --> 01:28:08.605
Bye-bye.

01:28:21.640 --> 01:28:23.540
Hey!

01:28:23.640 --> 01:28:27.281
Where do you juvenile delinquents
think you're off to?

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:33.260
Norman, I thought you were
in too much pain to exert yourself.

01:28:33.360 --> 01:28:35.220
Well... well, I am.

01:28:35.320 --> 01:28:38.140
I'm just doing this for Billy.

01:28:38.240 --> 01:28:41.100
Give the poor boy another chance
to catch a fish.

01:28:41.200 --> 01:28:44.740
We've been doing goddamn
jigsaw puzzles for a week.

01:28:44.840 --> 01:28:48.180
You will stay in our cove, won't you?

01:28:48.280 --> 01:28:50.620
There aren't any trout left in our cove.

01:28:50.720 --> 01:28:53.260
Norman, we have enough trout
left in the fridge

01:28:53.360 --> 01:28:55.540
to last us six years.

01:28:55.640 --> 01:28:57.980
But we haven't caught Walter yet.

01:28:58.080 --> 01:29:01.129
Never mind.
We'll stay in the damn cove.

01:29:53.560 --> 01:29:54.700
How did you get here?

01:29:54.800 --> 01:29:56.380
I rented a car.

01:29:56.480 --> 01:29:59.380
A Volare made by Plymouth.

01:29:59.480 --> 01:30:01.420
Look at you.

01:30:01.520 --> 01:30:03.780
My God, you've had this jacket
as long as I can remember.

01:30:03.880 --> 01:30:05.420
It looks it, doesn't it?

01:30:05.520 --> 01:30:06.580
It looks great.

01:30:06.680 --> 01:30:08.620
How was your trip?

01:30:08.720 --> 01:30:10.740
Not bad.
How's the kid?

01:30:10.840 --> 01:30:12.060
You still got him or did you drown him?

01:30:12.160 --> 01:30:14.060
We still got him.

01:30:14.160 --> 01:30:17.140
He's out there fishing
with his best buddy.

01:30:17.240 --> 01:30:19.100
You can see him.

01:30:19.200 --> 01:30:20.340
Where's the Thayer IV?

01:30:20.440 --> 01:30:22.700
Charlie's fixing her.

01:30:22.800 --> 01:30:24.740
Norman and Billy tried to drive her

01:30:24.840 --> 01:30:27.220
through a rock in Purgatory Cove.

01:30:27.320 --> 01:30:28.460
Did they get hurt?

01:30:28.560 --> 01:30:32.420
Norman got a bump on the head
which he's playing to the hilt,

01:30:32.520 --> 01:30:34.340
but he's all right.

01:30:34.440 --> 01:30:37.410
They're both fine, thank God.

01:30:48.200 --> 01:30:51.700
Do you still have Bill,
or did you drown him?

01:30:51.800 --> 01:30:54.460
Oh, I still have him.
He had to get back to the coast.

01:30:54.560 --> 01:30:56.460
He had a mouth that needed looking into.

01:30:59.800 --> 01:31:03.140
So, Norman and Billy
have gotten along all right?

01:31:03.240 --> 01:31:05.420
Billy is the happiest thing

01:31:05.520 --> 01:31:07.460
that's happened to Norman
since Roosevelt.

01:31:07.560 --> 01:31:11.042
I should have rented him
a 13-year-old boy years ago.

01:31:14.320 --> 01:31:15.970
You could have traded me in.

01:31:18.720 --> 01:31:23.140
Except I think he probably
makes a better son than I did.

01:31:23.240 --> 01:31:26.005
You made a very nice daughter.

01:31:28.800 --> 01:31:30.140
How come it's so easy?

01:31:30.240 --> 01:31:33.980
What do you mean, darling?

01:31:34.080 --> 01:31:37.140
Why wasn't that old son of a bitch
ever my friend?

01:31:37.240 --> 01:31:38.980
You're sounding very childish.

01:31:39.080 --> 01:31:40.900
Of course he was your friend.

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:42.820
He's your father.

01:31:42.920 --> 01:31:45.460
Chelsea, you're such a nice person.

01:31:45.560 --> 01:31:48.166
Can't you think
of something nice to say?

01:31:51.560 --> 01:31:54.100
I married Bill in Brussels.

01:31:54.200 --> 01:31:57.180
You did what in Brussels?

01:31:57.280 --> 01:31:59.740
I married Bill.

01:31:59.840 --> 01:32:01.460
Does it count in this country?

01:32:01.560 --> 01:32:02.860
'Fraid so!

01:32:02.960 --> 01:32:06.020
Bless you, darling.
Congratulations.

01:32:06.120 --> 01:32:08.500
- Nothing to it.
- Norman will be so pleased.

01:32:08.600 --> 01:32:10.100
Yeah, sure.

01:32:10.200 --> 01:32:12.580
What do you suppose he's gonna say?

01:32:12.680 --> 01:32:15.940
"Hey, Chels... fantastic.

01:32:16.040 --> 01:32:19.900
I'm so happy that you finally
got your life together

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:21.660
and I'm so proud."

01:32:21.760 --> 01:32:22.980
And he will be proud, but...

01:32:23.080 --> 01:32:25.220
No, he won't.
No, he won't.

01:32:25.320 --> 01:32:28.180
And you know why?
Because he doesn't care.

01:32:28.280 --> 01:32:30.487
He is a selfish son of a bitch!

01:32:32.840 --> 01:32:35.923
That old son of a bitch
happens to be my husband.

01:32:49.840 --> 01:32:53.260
Oh... shit!

01:32:53.360 --> 01:32:54.940
Oh, shit!

01:32:55.040 --> 01:32:56.620
Norman!
Shit!

01:32:56.720 --> 01:32:58.140
Don't get so excited.

01:32:58.240 --> 01:33:00.100
It's only a sunfish.

01:33:00.200 --> 01:33:01.780
Only a sunfish?

01:33:01.880 --> 01:33:04.100
Are you doubting the word of a genius?

01:33:04.200 --> 01:33:06.580
There are no respectable trout
in this cove.

01:33:06.680 --> 01:33:08.460
Chased them out years ago.

01:33:08.560 --> 01:33:11.220
Well, it's doing a pretty good
trout imitation.

01:33:11.320 --> 01:33:12.731
Get the net!

01:33:16.880 --> 01:33:20.140
Good God!
It's Walter!

01:33:20.240 --> 01:33:24.420
What the hell you doing here,
you son of a bitch?

01:33:24.520 --> 01:33:26.700
Keep that line tight, boy!

01:33:26.800 --> 01:33:29.380
Oh, you beauty!
Keep your line tight.

01:33:29.480 --> 01:33:31.380
Keep reeling in.

01:33:31.480 --> 01:33:33.460
A little closer.
A little closer.

01:33:33.560 --> 01:33:37.281
Oh, look at that!

01:33:38.920 --> 01:33:40.340
Have we caught Walter?

01:33:40.440 --> 01:33:42.602
We caught Walter, the son of a bitch!

01:33:55.240 --> 01:33:56.540
Chels.

01:33:56.640 --> 01:33:59.860
I brought your sweater and your shoes.

01:33:59.960 --> 01:34:01.420
And your car's out front.

01:34:01.520 --> 01:34:03.500
I'm such an ass, I'm sorry.

01:34:03.600 --> 01:34:05.100
I'm sorry, too.

01:34:05.200 --> 01:34:07.900
But, darling, you're wrong
about your dad.

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:10.140
He does care.
He cares deeply.

01:34:10.240 --> 01:34:13.801
It's just that he's an absolute mutt
about telling anyone.

01:34:15.320 --> 01:34:17.940
I know he'd walk through fire for me.

01:34:18.040 --> 01:34:20.100
And he'd walk through fire for you, too.

01:34:20.200 --> 01:34:24.205
And if you don't understand that,
you're not looking closely enough.

01:34:25.920 --> 01:34:28.100
I don't even know him.

01:34:28.200 --> 01:34:30.900
Chels, Norman is 80 years old.

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:34.260
He has heart palpitations
and trouble remembering things.

01:34:34.360 --> 01:34:39.140
Just exactly when do you expect
this friendship to begin?

01:34:39.240 --> 01:34:40.660
I'm afraid of him.

01:34:40.760 --> 01:34:42.740
Well, he's afraid of you.

01:34:42.840 --> 01:34:44.980
So you should get along fine.

01:34:45.080 --> 01:34:46.340
Here he comes, Chels.

01:34:46.440 --> 01:34:48.807
Talk to him.

01:34:56.160 --> 01:34:57.844
Hey, hey.

01:35:01.200 --> 01:35:02.620
Hey!

01:35:02.720 --> 01:35:04.900
Look at you!

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:08.260
- Hi, kid.
- Where's the dentist?

01:35:08.360 --> 01:35:09.980
He had to get back.

01:35:10.080 --> 01:35:12.740
- He'll call you tonight.
- Okay.

01:35:12.840 --> 01:35:16.220
- Hello, Norman.
- Well, well, well...

01:35:16.320 --> 01:35:19.380
Chelsea, we caught Walter.

01:35:19.480 --> 01:35:21.260
Do you know who Walter is?

01:35:21.360 --> 01:35:23.100
- Well, I have a feeling he's a fish.
- Yes.

01:35:23.200 --> 01:35:24.700
A humongous fish.

01:35:24.800 --> 01:35:26.180
And we caught him today,
didn't we, Norman?

01:35:26.280 --> 01:35:27.740
Well, let me see him.

01:35:27.840 --> 01:35:29.260
We let him go.

01:35:29.360 --> 01:35:31.020
Yeah, we let him go.

01:35:31.120 --> 01:35:33.460
I think I've heard this story before.

01:35:33.560 --> 01:35:34.980
No, no, it's true.

01:35:35.080 --> 01:35:37.740
See, Norman and I thought that
if Walter's lived this long,

01:35:37.840 --> 01:35:40.140
we should let him keep on living.

01:35:40.240 --> 01:35:41.380
I'm gonna go tell Ethel.

01:35:41.480 --> 01:35:42.900
Hey, Norman!

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.260
We caught the son of a bitch!
We caught him!

01:35:45.360 --> 01:35:46.885
Good job!

01:35:56.160 --> 01:35:57.580
You got yourself a friend, huh?

01:35:57.680 --> 01:36:01.401
He's all right.
Hasn't been too difficult.

01:36:03.360 --> 01:36:05.100
How's your forehead?

01:36:05.200 --> 01:36:08.900
- Your...
- Oh, this. It's all right.

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:11.571
A lot of pain.
Nothing to worry about.

01:36:15.600 --> 01:36:17.568
Norman, I want to talk to you.

01:36:19.760 --> 01:36:22.340
What seems to be the problem?

01:36:22.440 --> 01:36:25.940
There's no problem.
I just...

01:36:26.040 --> 01:36:27.963
I want to talk to you, I...

01:36:30.440 --> 01:36:32.820
I think that...

01:36:32.920 --> 01:36:34.700
maybe you and I should have
the kind of relationship

01:36:34.800 --> 01:36:36.780
that we're supposed to have.

01:36:36.880 --> 01:36:39.820
What kind of relationship is that?

01:36:39.920 --> 01:36:42.100
Well, you know, like a...

01:36:42.200 --> 01:36:43.460
like a father and a daughter.

01:36:43.560 --> 01:36:46.540
Just in the nick of time?

01:36:46.640 --> 01:36:47.980
Worried about the will, are you?

01:36:48.080 --> 01:36:51.420
Well, I'm leaving everything to you,
except what I'm taking with me.

01:36:51.520 --> 01:36:53.260
Just stop it!

01:36:53.360 --> 01:36:55.780
I don't want anything!

01:36:55.880 --> 01:36:57.380
It seems that you and me

01:36:57.480 --> 01:36:59.460
have been mad at each other for so long.

01:36:59.560 --> 01:37:00.940
I didn't know we were mad,

01:37:01.040 --> 01:37:03.884
I thought we just didn't
like each other.

01:37:11.720 --> 01:37:14.200
I want to be your friend.

01:37:16.720 --> 01:37:18.060
This mean you...

01:37:18.160 --> 01:37:19.900
come around more often?

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:21.240
It'll mean a lot to your mother.

01:37:25.640 --> 01:37:27.722
I'll come around more often.

01:37:30.400 --> 01:37:33.324
Well...

01:37:36.960 --> 01:37:38.580
Yep!

01:37:38.680 --> 01:37:41.300
I got married in Brussels.

01:37:41.400 --> 01:37:42.380
You did?

01:37:42.480 --> 01:37:44.700
In Brussels!

01:37:44.800 --> 01:37:46.380
He makes me very happy.

01:37:46.480 --> 01:37:47.540
Well, good.

01:37:47.640 --> 01:37:49.980
Does he speak English?

01:37:50.080 --> 01:37:51.500
Bill.
I married Bill.

01:37:51.600 --> 01:37:54.140
Bill? Oh, Bill!

01:37:54.240 --> 01:37:55.620
I'm glad, Chelsea.

01:37:55.720 --> 01:37:58.340
That's San Frantastic.

01:37:58.440 --> 01:38:02.060
- What?
- Is Billy gonna be living with you?

01:38:02.160 --> 01:38:03.900
Well, good.

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:07.300
Isn't that something?
Good for you!

01:38:07.400 --> 01:38:08.820
You know something?

01:38:08.920 --> 01:38:11.180
I got him doing the backflip
just like a pro.

01:38:11.280 --> 01:38:14.020
Oh, yeah?
That's great.

01:38:14.120 --> 01:38:15.980
Yeah, want me to get him down
to show you?

01:38:16.080 --> 01:38:19.220
- No, no. Not right now.
- Okay.

01:38:19.320 --> 01:38:21.540
Oh, that's right.

01:38:21.640 --> 01:38:24.220
You were never
a great backflipper, were you?

01:38:24.320 --> 01:38:27.460
I was always too fat, remember?

01:38:27.560 --> 01:38:29.660
Yeah, I do remember that now.

01:38:29.760 --> 01:38:31.580
Well, probably...

01:38:31.680 --> 01:38:34.140
a lot easier for a boy.

01:38:34.240 --> 01:38:35.924
I beg your pardon.

01:38:39.120 --> 01:38:41.540
Do you want to see me do a backflip?

01:38:43.320 --> 01:38:46.260
I am going to do a goddamn backflip.

01:38:46.360 --> 01:38:48.500
Chelsea, you don't have to.

01:38:48.600 --> 01:38:51.968
I want to.

01:39:04.120 --> 01:39:05.860
Make sure you go up, not just back.

01:39:05.960 --> 01:39:08.260
Up and back.

01:39:08.360 --> 01:39:09.860
Oh, I'm scared.

01:39:09.960 --> 01:39:10.980
Don't be scared.

01:39:11.080 --> 01:39:13.606
The backflip is one
of the easiest dives of all.

01:39:14.800 --> 01:39:16.540
I'm scared anyway.

01:39:16.640 --> 01:39:18.180
Don't do it.

01:39:18.280 --> 01:39:20.340
Doesn't matter if you don't do
the stupid dive.

01:39:20.440 --> 01:39:23.683
It's not important.

01:39:28.920 --> 01:39:31.380
I did it!

01:39:31.480 --> 01:39:32.900
She did it!

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:34.820
Chelsea did a backflip!

01:39:34.920 --> 01:39:36.620
I went over!

01:39:36.720 --> 01:39:39.380
It was lousy, but I did it!

01:39:39.480 --> 01:39:40.500
Good for you!

01:39:40.600 --> 01:39:42.409
Yay!

01:39:44.120 --> 01:39:46.900
You could come out
instead of going to Florida.

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:47.940
I will discuss it.

01:39:48.040 --> 01:39:50.180
If I can persuade Norman
that Los Angeles

01:39:50.280 --> 01:39:53.900
is part of the United States,
it shouldn't be too much trouble.

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:55.540
Norman!

01:39:55.640 --> 01:39:58.180
What in the world are you doing now?

01:39:58.280 --> 01:39:59.860
Hey, you're a cool breeze.

01:39:59.960 --> 01:40:02.180
Be sure to take a break from cruising.

01:40:02.280 --> 01:40:03.740
Wow!
Thank you, Captain.

01:40:03.840 --> 01:40:06.180
Norman, he can't take
that fool thing on the plane.

01:40:06.280 --> 01:40:08.300
Yes, he can.

01:40:08.400 --> 01:40:11.980
Got something for you, too.

01:40:12.080 --> 01:40:14.820
You know what this is?

01:40:14.920 --> 01:40:17.900
University of Pennsylvania
Diving Finals, 1921.

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:20.340
Second place.

01:40:20.440 --> 01:40:22.940
Oh, thanks.

01:40:23.040 --> 01:40:24.820
- Now I can retire.
- Show that to your new husband.

01:40:24.920 --> 01:40:27.651
Maybe he'll give us a discount
on dental work.

01:40:30.280 --> 01:40:31.980
Guess I'll be seeing you, you nitwit.

01:40:32.080 --> 01:40:33.900
- Okay.
- I'll miss you, Norman.

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:36.780
Bye-bye, darling.

01:40:36.880 --> 01:40:39.406
- Good-bye, woman.
- Bye-bye, Billy.

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:43.780
Well...

01:40:43.880 --> 01:40:46.220
good-bye, Norman.

01:40:46.320 --> 01:40:47.765
Dad.

01:41:11.240 --> 01:41:12.500
Come on, Norman.

01:41:12.600 --> 01:41:16.620
Let's get these last boxes
out to the car and be gone.

01:41:16.720 --> 01:41:18.643
For God's sake!

01:41:21.160 --> 01:41:22.300
Not too heavy, is it?

01:41:22.400 --> 01:41:24.180
Of course it's not too heavy...

01:41:24.280 --> 01:41:26.060
God, this is heavy!

01:41:26.160 --> 01:41:27.620
You're trying to kill me.

01:41:27.720 --> 01:41:30.220
I've thought about it.
Put it down if it's too much.

01:41:30.320 --> 01:41:32.860
- What the hell you have in here?
- My mother's china.

01:41:32.960 --> 01:41:34.580
Put the box down, darling.

01:41:34.680 --> 01:41:36.260
Your mother never liked me.

01:41:36.360 --> 01:41:38.203
'Course she did.

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:43.540
Norman, what is it?

01:41:43.640 --> 01:41:45.460
What's the matter, darling?

01:41:45.560 --> 01:41:47.449
What's the matter?

01:41:50.360 --> 01:41:51.521
Oh, my God!

01:41:52.960 --> 01:41:54.740
Norman! Norman!

01:41:54.840 --> 01:41:57.260
My darling...

01:41:57.360 --> 01:41:59.260
my darling.

01:41:59.360 --> 01:42:01.010
I'll get your medicine.

01:42:05.680 --> 01:42:07.728
Here, Norman.

01:42:10.360 --> 01:42:11.740
Take this, darling.

01:42:11.840 --> 01:42:13.180
Put it under your tongue.

01:42:13.280 --> 01:42:15.100
- What is it?
- Nitroglycerin.

01:42:15.200 --> 01:42:18.409
Put it under your tongue.

01:42:23.400 --> 01:42:27.060
Dear God, don't take him now.

01:42:27.160 --> 01:42:28.580
You don't want him.

01:42:28.680 --> 01:42:31.380
He's just an old poop.

01:42:31.480 --> 01:42:34.380
Norman! Norman!

01:42:34.480 --> 01:42:36.660
Maybe we should call a doctor.

01:42:36.760 --> 01:42:39.260
Oh, yes, I'll get the telephone.

01:42:39.360 --> 01:42:43.126
I'll get the telephone.

01:42:47.400 --> 01:42:48.700
Hello, hello.

01:42:48.800 --> 01:42:51.900
Dear God.
Dear God.

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:54.380
How are you feeling, Norman?

01:42:54.480 --> 01:42:56.380
Pretty good.
How are you?

01:42:56.480 --> 01:42:57.940
How's the angina?

01:42:58.040 --> 01:43:01.540
- The what?
- The pain, dammit!

01:43:01.640 --> 01:43:04.420
Pretty good, as pain goes.

01:43:04.520 --> 01:43:05.780
This stupid operator!

01:43:05.880 --> 01:43:08.060
Hello. Hello.

01:43:08.160 --> 01:43:11.300
Hello, hello, hello.

01:43:11.400 --> 01:43:13.020
What's the matter with her?

01:43:13.120 --> 01:43:16.220
She's slow.

01:43:16.320 --> 01:43:17.900
How are you feeling now?

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:21.340
I don't know.

01:43:21.440 --> 01:43:23.340
Are you planning to die?

01:43:23.440 --> 01:43:24.860
Is that what you're up to?

01:43:24.960 --> 01:43:28.500
While I'm waiting for this moron
to answer the telephone,

01:43:28.600 --> 01:43:31.060
let me say something to you,
Norman Thayer Jr.,

01:43:31.160 --> 01:43:32.740
I'd rather you didn't.

01:43:32.840 --> 01:43:35.180
- Really?
- Yes.

01:43:35.280 --> 01:43:37.380
Oh, this stupid, stupid operator.

01:43:37.480 --> 01:43:40.780
I'm going to have to call
the hospital directly.

01:43:40.880 --> 01:43:43.460
The phone book...
I'll get the phone book.

01:43:43.560 --> 01:43:47.100
Ethel.

01:43:47.200 --> 01:43:49.500
- What is it?
- Will you come here?

01:43:49.600 --> 01:43:50.965
Oh, my God.

01:43:53.920 --> 01:43:56.060
Yes, Norman?

01:43:56.160 --> 01:43:57.620
My darling.

01:43:57.720 --> 01:43:59.420
Ethel.

01:43:59.520 --> 01:44:02.020
Yes. I'm here, Norman.

01:44:02.120 --> 01:44:03.340
Ethel.

01:44:03.440 --> 01:44:06.020
Yes, yes, yes?

01:44:06.120 --> 01:44:07.540
Ethel.

01:44:07.640 --> 01:44:11.580
What is it, Norman?

01:44:11.680 --> 01:44:14.900
I think I'm feeling all right now.

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:17.380
My God, are you serious?

01:44:17.480 --> 01:44:19.420
My heart stopped hurting.

01:44:19.520 --> 01:44:21.660
Maybe I'm dead.

01:44:21.760 --> 01:44:24.420
I love you so much.

01:44:24.520 --> 01:44:26.340
Sorry about your mother's china.

01:44:26.440 --> 01:44:28.900
Why did you strain yourself?
You know better.

01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:31.380
I was showing off.
Trying to turn you on.

01:44:31.480 --> 01:44:33.100
Well, you succeeded.

01:44:33.200 --> 01:44:35.420
No need for you to try
that sort of thing again.

01:44:35.520 --> 01:44:38.100
Good.

01:44:38.200 --> 01:44:39.860
You know something?

01:44:39.960 --> 01:44:41.900
This is the first time
that I've really felt

01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:43.420
that we were gonna die.

01:44:43.520 --> 01:44:45.500
I've known it all along.

01:44:45.600 --> 01:44:48.380
When I looked at you here,

01:44:48.480 --> 01:44:50.060
on the floor,

01:44:50.160 --> 01:44:52.900
I could actually see you dead.

01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:54.580
I could see you...

01:44:54.680 --> 01:44:56.820
I could see you in your blue suit
and white starched shirt

01:44:56.920 --> 01:44:59.460
in Thomas' Funeral Parlor
on Bradshaw Street.

01:44:59.560 --> 01:45:02.500
- How'd I look?
- Not good, Norman.

01:45:02.600 --> 01:45:04.860
You've been talking about death
ever since we met.

01:45:04.960 --> 01:45:07.500
But this is the first time
I really felt it.

01:45:07.600 --> 01:45:09.329
How's it feel?

01:45:11.840 --> 01:45:13.900
It feels odd.

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:16.900
Cold... I guess.

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:19.620
Not... not that bad really.

01:45:19.720 --> 01:45:21.980
Not so... frightening.

01:45:22.080 --> 01:45:25.260
Almost comforting.
Not such a bad place to go.

01:45:25.360 --> 01:45:28.340
I don't know.

01:45:28.440 --> 01:45:30.540
Oh, Norman.

01:45:30.640 --> 01:45:32.940
Oh, God.

01:45:33.040 --> 01:45:35.060
Well...

01:45:35.160 --> 01:45:38.340
don't you wanna say good-bye
to the lake?

01:45:38.440 --> 01:45:40.100
Do you think you're strong enough?

01:45:40.200 --> 01:45:42.009
I think so.

01:45:44.600 --> 01:45:49.060
If I fall over face first in the water,
you'll know I wasn't.

01:45:49.160 --> 01:45:51.380
Well, take it easy, for God's sake.

01:45:51.480 --> 01:45:54.290
I'm only good for one near miss a day.

01:45:56.480 --> 01:45:57.700
Hello, there.

01:45:57.800 --> 01:45:59.700
Hi.

01:45:59.800 --> 01:46:01.420
Want to dance?

01:46:01.520 --> 01:46:03.460
Or would you rather just suck face?

01:46:03.560 --> 01:46:06.131
Norman, you really are a case.

01:46:10.160 --> 01:46:12.060
Ethel, listen.

01:46:12.160 --> 01:46:14.020
The loons.

01:46:14.120 --> 01:46:17.010
They've come around to say good-bye.

01:46:33.720 --> 01:46:36.060
Just two of them now.

01:46:36.160 --> 01:46:37.664
Their baby's all grown up

01:46:37.764 --> 01:46:40.927
and moved to Los Angeles or somewhere.
