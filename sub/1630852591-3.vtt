00:11.511 --> 00:14.264


00:14.347 --> 00:18.852
<i>The churches are empty</i>,
<i>but the carnivals are full.</i>

00:20.395 --> 00:24.274
An evil clown disembowels a priest
with a cotton candy machine.

00:24.357 --> 00:26.317
That is an actual scene in this movie.
How--

00:26.401 --> 00:29.779
You think there's no room for
faith-based stories about a higher power?

00:29.863 --> 00:33.742
<i>Devil's Shed, Hellfire and Damnation,</i>
<i>Caged Angels</i>…

00:33.825 --> 00:35.243
That's just this year.

00:35.493 --> 00:38.705
What is the nature of evil?
What is our responsibility to fight it?

00:38.788 --> 00:42.000
Manipulative, pseudo-religious trash.

00:42.083 --> 00:44.002
I'm embarrassed we're talking about it.

00:44.085 --> 00:45.503
Everyone's talking about it.

01:24.417 --> 01:27.670
<i>My mother left me in a church</i>
<i>when I was two months old.</i>

01:29.839 --> 01:31.800
<i>It was the middle of winter.</i>

01:36.262 --> 01:37.680
<i>No one saw her do it.</i>

01:51.569 --> 01:54.739
<i>I spent</i>
<i>the next ten years at St. Joseph's.</i>

01:54.823 --> 01:56.783
Hail Mary, full of grace.

01:58.243 --> 01:59.828
The Lord is with thee.

02:07.585 --> 02:10.046
<i>I was a strange kid.</i>

02:11.047 --> 02:12.298
<i>Always in trouble.</i>

02:15.009 --> 02:16.928
<i>The nuns thought I was damaged goods.</i>

02:38.408 --> 02:39.534
What are these?

02:42.495 --> 02:45.165
-I don't know.
-You don't know what these are?

02:50.420 --> 02:51.838
There's another place.

02:53.089 --> 02:55.175
There's something in there.

02:59.721 --> 03:01.472
I know, it sounds crazy.

03:02.599 --> 03:05.310
But this feeling
would start to pull at me.

03:06.352 --> 03:08.438
And I knew there was another place.

03:08.521 --> 03:11.649
And I couldn't describe it,
so I had to draw it

03:11.733 --> 03:15.278
to keep myself from falling inside of it.

03:16.112 --> 03:19.199
So, how long
did you experience these visions?

03:19.741 --> 03:23.494
Until my foster mom, Lila,
got me the fuck out of there.

03:26.122 --> 03:27.707
She died last spring.

03:28.416 --> 03:29.417
A stroke.

03:30.251 --> 03:31.252
I'm sorry.

03:33.254 --> 03:36.549
I don't know if it's stress or grief or…

03:37.425 --> 03:39.052
a mental fucking break,

03:39.844 --> 03:42.722
but I'm starting
to see that shit again, or…

03:43.640 --> 03:44.724
feel it.

03:46.559 --> 03:48.311
Something shifts and…

03:50.063 --> 03:52.815
I can't think, I can't breathe, I…

03:55.944 --> 03:58.988
It's like I'm right back inside
that scared little girl.

04:01.532 --> 04:03.326
Can you fix me?

04:03.409 --> 04:06.454
Yeah, I think we can work together
to find some techniques

04:06.537 --> 04:09.916
to deal with this anxiety
you've been experiencing. Okay?

04:13.086 --> 04:14.337
-Okay.

04:14.420 --> 04:15.421
All right.

04:17.090 --> 04:18.675
Hey, how you doing?

04:18.758 --> 04:21.886
-Oh!

04:21.970 --> 04:25.098
-Cleo! I am so sorry. Down!
-No, it's fine.

04:25.682 --> 04:27.850
Oh, you're a good girl, aren't you?

04:27.934 --> 04:30.019
<i>That's Cleo. This is Melody.</i>

04:31.396 --> 04:32.981
<i> You're a good girl, Cleo.</i>

04:33.064 --> 04:35.942
-Here, come here. Calm down.
-Aren't you? You're a good girl.

04:36.025 --> 04:37.527
<i> I am so sorry.</i>

04:37.610 --> 04:39.821
<i>Okay, down.</i>

04:39.904 --> 04:44.951
<i>End patient session, Melody Pendras,</i>
<i>February 24th, 1993.</i>

04:54.919 --> 04:56.838
<i>Have a chance</i>
<i>to listen to those tapes?</i>

04:58.172 --> 04:59.173
A few.

05:00.466 --> 05:02.260
Anything interesting in there?

05:02.343 --> 05:03.636
<i>I'm not sure yet.</i>

05:04.345 --> 05:08.182
Okay, well,
I did a little digging about that letter.

05:08.266 --> 05:10.101
Article 60 in the department guidelines:

05:10.184 --> 05:12.145
"Faculty are prohibited
from publishing material

05:12.228 --> 05:15.898
that would affect reputation, community,
or educational standing of NYU."

05:15.982 --> 05:20.236
<i>Any idea what he might've been publishing?</i>
<i>Something that got him in trouble?</i>

05:20.320 --> 05:21.487
No. No. Anything else?

05:21.571 --> 05:25.241
Remember that musicologist I used
to date, the one with the Dvorak tattoo?

05:25.325 --> 05:27.285
I sent your mystery tune to her.

05:27.368 --> 05:28.870
She never heard anything like it.

05:28.953 --> 05:31.789
Unless they're saying the name
of some flying lemur in Southeast Asia,

05:31.873 --> 05:34.208
I got nothing on "Ka-lay-go."
What about you?

05:34.292 --> 05:36.961
Well, I spent all night
taking my bathroom apart.

05:38.921 --> 05:42.633
<i>I opened up the mirror,</i>
<i>disassembled the fixtures,</i>

05:43.509 --> 05:44.761
<i>checked behind every plate.</i>

05:48.514 --> 05:49.557
No cameras in there.

05:49.640 --> 05:52.894
Oh, so he's an asshole, not a pervert.
That's a comfort, I guess.

05:53.478 --> 05:56.397
<i>Get this. Davenport said</i>
<i>there was no internet up here,</i>

05:56.481 --> 05:58.441
<i>but there's a data port on the wall.</i>

05:59.400 --> 06:03.029
<i>So I opened up the plaster</i>
<i>and found a snake's nest of cables.</i>

06:03.112 --> 06:05.531
-<i>Surveillance system.</i>
-<i>Exactly.</i>

06:06.866 --> 06:09.243
<i>I tapped the feed using the vampire tap.</i>

06:10.495 --> 06:13.623
I have access to all the cameras
in the compound now, inside and out.

06:13.706 --> 06:16.042
<i>I can see exactly what he sees.</i>

06:16.667 --> 06:19.796
<i>Now all I have to do is finish mapping</i>
<i>all the camera positions.</i>

06:20.338 --> 06:23.508
<i>Then I'll know exactly</i>
<i>where I have privacy and where I don't.</i>

06:24.509 --> 06:25.468
Dude, fuck yeah.

06:25.551 --> 06:27.970
What about the basement?
MacGyver your way back in there yet?

06:28.054 --> 06:29.680
No. I'm working on it.

06:29.764 --> 06:31.057
<i>Okay, well, be careful.</i>

06:31.140 --> 06:33.226
Remember that time I electrocuted myself

06:33.309 --> 06:35.978
trying to disassemble
the animatronic duck at Chuck E. Cheese?

06:36.062 --> 06:38.106
<i>Even though I'd researched</i>
<i>the whole thing on YouTube?</i>

06:38.189 --> 06:39.524
-Oh.

06:40.775 --> 06:41.901
Car's here.

06:41.984 --> 06:44.320
Hey, hey, uh, when you see Melody,

06:45.488 --> 06:47.240
just be gentle with her.

06:47.323 --> 06:48.825
She's been through a lot.

06:48.908 --> 06:50.201
Yeah, of course.

06:51.411 --> 06:52.954
<i>Try to be a human being.</i>

06:53.037 --> 06:55.081
<i> Human being. Got it.</i>

06:55.164 --> 06:56.457
<i>I'll keep you posted.</i>

07:53.931 --> 07:55.016
Oh!

07:57.935 --> 08:01.606
I didn't know
anyone was using this room. I just…

08:03.316 --> 08:04.859
The lights were off.

08:07.695 --> 08:08.779
Oh. No.

08:09.947 --> 08:11.407
I'm not using it. No, I'm just…

08:13.576 --> 08:14.827
Doodling?

08:16.037 --> 08:17.705
Something like that.

08:19.457 --> 08:21.292
I… I can get out of your way.

08:21.375 --> 08:23.544
What? No. No, I mean…

08:24.587 --> 08:26.422
This is the community room.

08:28.132 --> 08:30.760
You're in the community. Right?

08:36.390 --> 08:37.475
I'm Melody.

08:39.519 --> 08:40.561
Dan.

08:42.939 --> 08:46.901
I just moved in,
so I actually don't know the rules.

08:46.984 --> 08:48.736
Um… Me too.

08:49.946 --> 08:51.113
I'm new.

08:55.868 --> 08:58.246
This building is weird as shit, right?

08:59.497 --> 09:01.499
-Yes.
-Yeah.

09:02.083 --> 09:04.835
So, we're both new.

09:05.545 --> 09:07.046
We should get a drink sometime.

09:07.129 --> 09:10.341
You know, talk about
the shitty water pressure.

09:10.967 --> 09:11.801
Oh.

09:12.301 --> 09:14.053
Unless you don't drink.

09:15.304 --> 09:16.681
We could get a coffee.

09:18.099 --> 09:20.601
Or we could go across the street
to that little store

09:20.685 --> 09:24.564
and drink a pineapple Fanta
straight out of the can.

09:36.784 --> 09:38.119
Who… Who is it?

09:43.249 --> 09:44.333
Bobbi.

09:49.922 --> 09:51.841
Is that supposed to mean something to me?

09:53.259 --> 09:55.386
I work for Mr. Davenport.

10:01.559 --> 10:03.853
Shower was running a long time.

10:05.938 --> 10:08.024
I was waiting for the hot water.

10:11.652 --> 10:14.780
Mr. Davenport was supposed
to put you in a different room.

10:14.864 --> 10:17.074
That bathroom's got a mold problem.

10:17.158 --> 10:18.492
No, there's no mold.

10:21.537 --> 10:22.872
I can come back later if--

10:22.955 --> 10:24.206
No, there's no mold.

10:25.041 --> 10:27.209
Davenport promised me privacy here.

10:28.252 --> 10:30.588
If there's a problem,
I can take care of it myself.

10:35.384 --> 10:38.554
If you need anything, you let me know.

10:52.985 --> 10:54.612
<i>You gonna do the thing?</i>

10:54.695 --> 10:55.529
<i> What?</i>

10:55.613 --> 10:57.573
<i>Make it official, do the thing?</i>

10:57.657 --> 10:59.158
<i>This is Melody Pendras.</i>

10:59.241 --> 11:01.661
<i>It's 10:32 a.m.</i>

11:02.244 --> 11:06.999
<i>I'm in the Visser community room,</i>
<i>location of last night's… meeting.</i>

11:08.167 --> 11:10.586
<i>AKA… sex club!</i>

11:10.670 --> 11:13.464
<i>Luckily, I brought my trusty black light.</i>

11:13.547 --> 11:16.175
<i>Girls, women, you really</i>
<i>shouldn't leave home without one.</i>

11:16.258 --> 11:17.385
Anabelle.

11:17.468 --> 11:21.597
Sorry. I wouldn't wanna think about
my mother in a sex cult either.

11:22.598 --> 11:26.477
There was this big cabinet
with some kind of…

11:27.311 --> 11:28.979
totem thing inside.

11:30.564 --> 11:31.774
And a recording.

11:32.983 --> 11:34.777
With some strange voice.

11:36.404 --> 11:37.697
Coming from…

11:47.748 --> 11:50.501
Holy shit, is that Juice Newton?

11:54.672 --> 11:56.465
Maybe the kid knows something.

11:57.633 --> 11:58.551
Jess?

11:59.176 --> 12:02.263
She's 14. I don't know if I wanna
pull her into something like this.

12:02.346 --> 12:03.556
Oh, please. When I was her age,

12:03.639 --> 12:05.766
I was letting Alicia Metz
finger me in the locker room

12:05.850 --> 12:07.184
during sixth period algebra.

12:07.268 --> 12:10.771
Okay. Okay. I'll talk to her
when she gets home from school.

12:25.745 --> 12:27.037
Cassandra, right?

12:30.332 --> 12:32.042
Remember me? Jess's friend?

12:46.265 --> 12:47.641
Aren't you lovely?

12:48.768 --> 12:51.228
Yeah. I get that a lot.

12:52.980 --> 12:53.856
Um…

12:54.523 --> 12:56.400
Did I see you here last night?

13:01.071 --> 13:02.239
I don't think so.

13:03.491 --> 13:07.328
With Samuel and other people
from the building?

13:10.080 --> 13:11.540
Do you play canasta?

13:12.166 --> 13:14.502
Sign-up's on the board, if you're game.

13:21.884 --> 13:22.885
I like her.

13:24.970 --> 13:25.888
Jess?

13:26.722 --> 13:27.723
Hello?

13:30.893 --> 13:31.894
Hey.

13:41.862 --> 13:42.863
Are you okay?

13:46.575 --> 13:47.743
I got in a fight.

13:49.036 --> 13:49.912
A fight?

13:49.995 --> 13:53.207
I just wanna be better.
I don't wanna wait.

13:54.667 --> 13:55.668
Wait for what?

13:59.380 --> 14:01.340
-Do you want me to call your mom?
-No.

14:03.676 --> 14:04.510
Don't.

14:05.845 --> 14:07.972
She'll just send me to Father Russo again.

14:08.055 --> 14:10.224
He'll tell me I'm not trying hard enough.

14:10.808 --> 14:11.892
Trying to do what?

14:12.935 --> 14:14.186
To have faith.

14:14.895 --> 14:17.439
Be pure, to be worthy of God's love.

14:19.149 --> 14:24.613
Yeah, I'm familiar with the kind of help
the church likes to give.

14:25.948 --> 14:27.908
Every time it happens, I just…

14:30.369 --> 14:32.496
I don't want people to see me like that.

14:36.250 --> 14:38.294
Teenagers are assholes.

14:40.254 --> 14:41.630
No, but they're right.

14:42.464 --> 14:44.216
Something's wrong with me.

14:49.930 --> 14:51.056
I'm scared.

14:52.850 --> 14:55.311
I'm scared I'll feel like this
for the rest of my life.

14:55.394 --> 14:56.520
You won't.

15:01.942 --> 15:03.652
I used to have these…

15:06.614 --> 15:07.656
I don't know…

15:09.408 --> 15:11.827
waking moments of terror, I guess.

15:13.412 --> 15:15.873
But I found someone who helped me.

15:17.291 --> 15:19.919
And there are people out there
who can help you.

15:20.002 --> 15:23.047
Not priests, but people who care.

15:24.006 --> 15:25.341
Maybe for you.

15:26.842 --> 15:28.135
Not for me.

15:34.266 --> 15:36.018
<i>You know</i>
<i>what people really love?</i>

15:36.101 --> 15:39.313
When strangers take their kids
to see shrinks.

15:41.565 --> 15:43.025
Jess is in pain.

15:43.108 --> 15:46.487
She needs help, and her mother thinks
the Catholic Church has the answers.

15:46.570 --> 15:48.280
Let me tell you from personal experience,

15:48.364 --> 15:50.783
their methodologies
are not fucking helpful.

15:51.408 --> 15:53.327
They're the opposite of helpful.

15:53.410 --> 15:55.537
I thought you and Dr. Turner
had a falling out.

15:55.621 --> 15:57.539
<i> Which means he owes me a favor.</i>

15:59.124 --> 16:01.752
<i>He really helped me. A lot.</i>

16:05.005 --> 16:06.590
<i>He's a good person.</i>

16:06.674 --> 16:08.217
<i>See, this is your problem.</i>

16:08.300 --> 16:09.927
<i>You're always picking up strays.</i>

16:10.010 --> 16:14.848
<i>You need to be more Sarah Connor</i>
<i>and less Mary-fucking-Poppins.</i>

16:14.932 --> 16:15.891
<i>Whatever.</i>

16:15.975 --> 16:19.895
<i>I'm gonna take her on Saturday morning,</i>
<i>so you'll have to make your own coffee.</i>

16:42.459 --> 16:44.003
<i>You mind if I record this?</i>

16:44.086 --> 16:47.339
It helps me take notes, but if
you're not comfortable with it, we don't--

16:47.423 --> 16:48.507
It's okay.

16:49.133 --> 16:51.593
Maybe I'll tell some good jokes
you'll wanna remember.

16:51.677 --> 16:52.970
Okay.

16:53.053 --> 16:58.559
So these episodes, how long
have you been experiencing them?

16:59.143 --> 17:01.729
Can't remember exactly.

17:02.604 --> 17:03.856
A while.

17:03.939 --> 17:06.483
Everyone says they're in my head.

17:08.360 --> 17:11.822
So what does it feel like,
like, right before it happens?

17:11.905 --> 17:15.242
Do you hear a ringing in your ear
or see bright lights?

17:15.325 --> 17:17.036
It's more like…

17:20.664 --> 17:21.582
I'm being…

17:22.541 --> 17:24.460
pulled somewhere.

17:25.794 --> 17:26.920
And then,

17:28.213 --> 17:29.673
I don't know, I guess I just…

17:31.008 --> 17:32.051
come back.

17:36.180 --> 17:37.514
All right, one last question.

17:37.598 --> 17:39.308
Okay, it's very important.

17:40.851 --> 17:42.436
Do you like dogs?

17:44.146 --> 17:45.481
Yeah.

17:45.564 --> 17:46.774
Well, this…

17:47.566 --> 17:48.692
Come on.

17:49.276 --> 17:50.444
…is…

17:51.278 --> 17:52.196
Yep!

17:52.946 --> 17:54.740
-This is Cleo.
-Cleo!

17:54.823 --> 17:56.116
Hey!

17:56.950 --> 18:00.621
Yeah, you rub behind her ears,
she'll love you for the rest of her life.

18:01.705 --> 18:03.415
Come on. Let's go.

18:13.884 --> 18:14.760
Well?

18:15.427 --> 18:19.932
Could be anxiety, could be stress,
it could be a seizure disorder.

18:20.015 --> 18:23.685
Look, I can't rule anything out
until I do a full neurological workup,

18:23.769 --> 18:28.107
but obviously I can't do that
without written parental consent.

18:28.190 --> 18:29.024
Sorry.

18:29.108 --> 18:31.401
Even if her mother
did ask you to bring her.

18:32.111 --> 18:33.612
I'm just worried about her.

18:34.238 --> 18:35.280
I know.

18:37.699 --> 18:39.409
How are you doing, Melody?

18:41.203 --> 18:43.163
I decided to go through with it.

18:43.831 --> 18:46.125
To look for my mother.
I know you don't approve.

18:46.208 --> 18:49.128
It's not my place
to approve or disapprove.

18:49.211 --> 18:51.088
I just didn't want you to get hurt.

18:51.839 --> 18:53.966
Maybe she doesn't wanna get hurt either.

18:55.551 --> 18:57.553
Maybe she wants to see me, but…

18:59.346 --> 19:00.514
she's scared.

19:03.225 --> 19:04.935
Are you ever scared of your kids?

19:05.602 --> 19:06.854
All the time.

19:07.938 --> 19:09.022
I'm, uh…

19:10.065 --> 19:12.901
afraid they won't love me
as much as I love them.

19:16.029 --> 19:17.865
<i>Do you think you can help Jess?</i>

19:17.948 --> 19:19.992
<i>I mean, like you helped me?</i>

19:20.075 --> 19:21.869
<i> We are going, right now!</i>

19:21.952 --> 19:23.120
<i>Mom, don't!</i>

19:23.787 --> 19:25.289
Are you Melody?

19:25.372 --> 19:26.248
Ms. Lewis.

19:26.331 --> 19:29.585
Who do you think you are, taking my
daughter to a doctor behind my back?

19:29.668 --> 19:30.919
I'm sorry, I did…

19:31.795 --> 19:35.757
Jess said she talked to you.
She said she had your permission.

19:37.843 --> 19:40.095
-Didn't have a chance to ask.

19:41.597 --> 19:45.475
Oh, my God. I am sorry.
I am so sorry. I was just trying to help--

19:45.559 --> 19:48.937
Shh! Stay out of her business.
We don't need your help.

19:50.355 --> 19:51.231
I'm sorry.

19:55.485 --> 19:57.571
I mean, I'd be upset too, Melody.

19:58.155 --> 20:00.407
You can't parent other people's kids.

20:02.117 --> 20:05.329
I used to pray that someone
would come and parent me.

20:08.248 --> 20:09.249
Melod--

20:13.170 --> 20:14.421
Damn it.

20:37.903 --> 20:39.154
The fuck…?

20:49.456 --> 20:50.749
What are you doing?

20:54.836 --> 20:57.172
Just double-checking your power strips.

20:58.173 --> 21:00.592
Are you the groundskeeper or tech support?

21:03.887 --> 21:05.389
Everything looks good.

21:07.266 --> 21:08.267
Hey, um…

21:09.851 --> 21:12.729
You said if I needed help with anything,
I should let you know?

21:13.230 --> 21:14.106
Right.

21:14.898 --> 21:18.318
Yeah, you could open up that chapel
for me, the one that's all boarded up.

21:36.503 --> 21:38.630
Melody? Melody Pendras?

21:41.550 --> 21:43.593
Hi. I'm Mark Higgins.

21:44.678 --> 21:46.763
I'm doing a story
about the Visser Apartments

21:46.847 --> 21:49.933
and came across a set of tapes
you shot there in '94,

21:50.017 --> 21:52.060
some kind of interview footage.

21:54.187 --> 21:57.858
Uh, I was hoping I could take you
to coffee, ask you a few questions.

21:59.735 --> 22:01.695
<i>So the tapes weren't real?</i>

22:01.778 --> 22:05.699
What, you think all those <i>Blair Witch</i> guys
invented that stuff?

22:08.076 --> 22:09.828
Uh, I guess not.

22:10.704 --> 22:13.248
Um, and on the tapes you said you were…

22:13.832 --> 22:16.084
you were looking for your mom.
Was that real?

22:17.586 --> 22:18.754
Never found her.

22:19.588 --> 22:22.507
Sorry. Must have been… hard.

22:25.469 --> 22:26.553
Ah…

22:27.429 --> 22:29.181
You wanna know about the fire.

22:32.392 --> 22:35.896
Well, I don't remember much, to be honest.

22:36.563 --> 22:40.400
I woke up in the middle of the night,
and everything was on fire.

22:41.693 --> 22:42.778
Including me.

22:42.861 --> 22:46.948
Next thing I know,
I'm waking up in the hospital.

22:47.699 --> 22:49.409
They listed me as a Jane Doe.

22:51.203 --> 22:53.038
So no one came looking for me.

22:55.791 --> 23:00.587
So I decided to, uh, start over,
make a new life.

23:02.339 --> 23:04.925
Um, you're not touch
with anyone you met there?

23:06.093 --> 23:06.968
No.

23:10.430 --> 23:13.809
What about Steven Turner? Anything you can
tell me about your relationship with him?

23:15.185 --> 23:17.521
Like I said, I don't remember much.

23:20.565 --> 23:21.525
Um, could you…

23:21.608 --> 23:25.153
Would listen to something for me
and tell me if you recognize it?

23:26.238 --> 23:27.364
Uh, sure.

23:51.054 --> 23:51.930
Pretty.

23:57.102 --> 23:58.103
Okay.

23:59.438 --> 24:00.397
Uh…

24:01.189 --> 24:02.524
Thanks so much for your time.

24:04.568 --> 24:06.903
Well, I wish I could've been more helpful.

24:07.529 --> 24:09.489
Oh, it's not a problem. Um…

24:10.031 --> 24:11.408
I'll show myself out.

24:15.787 --> 24:17.205
You would've liked Cleo.

24:18.457 --> 24:20.625
She had a thing
for shredding paper towels too.

24:22.335 --> 24:26.423
My dad didn't really like dogs,
but I begged him until he gave in.

24:28.675 --> 24:30.886
She ran away after the fire.

24:34.097 --> 24:35.807
She wasn't really a city dog.

24:36.725 --> 24:38.560
-Fuck. Shit.

24:43.356 --> 24:45.150
Okay. I'll be right back.

25:17.766 --> 25:19.184
I waited for you.

25:20.519 --> 25:23.688
I thought we were getting
pineapple Fantas across the street.

25:27.859 --> 25:29.027
It's okay.

25:32.280 --> 25:34.866
I'm probably the one who got it wrong.

25:35.951 --> 25:37.327
I keep doing that.

25:38.578 --> 25:41.748
Making the wrong choices,
fucking things up.

25:43.041 --> 25:44.584
Letting people down.

25:48.296 --> 25:49.339
No, you don't.

25:50.215 --> 25:51.591
Thanks, but…

25:52.801 --> 25:54.302
you don't really know me.

25:54.928 --> 25:56.054
I do.

25:57.389 --> 25:58.390
I mean,

25:59.641 --> 26:01.601
I know that you're a good person.

26:02.769 --> 26:05.021
And that you care about people.

26:07.941 --> 26:09.943
You try to make people feel safe.

26:12.612 --> 26:14.406
It's a feature, not a bug.

26:28.253 --> 26:30.130
<i> I thought you didn't do church.</i>

26:31.298 --> 26:32.173
<i>I don't.</i>

26:33.258 --> 26:36.094
<i>But I want to meet this priest,</i>
<i>Father Russo.</i>

26:36.761 --> 26:38.138
<i>Maybe I can enlist him.</i>

26:38.847 --> 26:40.765
<i>Yeah. Kinky.</i>

26:41.975 --> 26:43.893
<i>To get Jess some real help.</i>

26:43.977 --> 26:45.729
<i>All right, well,</i>

26:45.812 --> 26:48.356
<i>subject is going to church,</i>
<i>which she hates,</i>

26:48.440 --> 26:51.735
<i>to speak with clergy who she hates.</i>

26:52.944 --> 26:53.820
<i>Yeah.</i>

26:57.282 --> 26:58.199
Godspeed.

26:58.283 --> 27:01.578
The true test of our faith
comes down to one question:

27:03.538 --> 27:06.082
How will we stand against darkness?

27:06.166 --> 27:09.127
The temptations of the Devil are real.

27:10.170 --> 27:14.341
And so, I say,
look upon the Devil in all his forms,

27:14.424 --> 27:17.719
even if his image arrives
at the local movie theater.

27:18.428 --> 27:22.724
A lot's been said
about this new film, <i>Satan's Carnival</i>.

27:24.184 --> 27:27.562
Is it anti-church?
Does it glorify the Devil?

27:28.313 --> 27:30.649
Well, I say it's worth seeing
and thinking about

27:30.732 --> 27:32.567
and deciding for yourself.

27:33.943 --> 27:38.531
And as you look upon Hollywood's vision
of good and evil, ask yourself,

27:39.199 --> 27:40.450
<i>"What will I do</i>

27:41.785 --> 27:44.037
<i>when I face the Devil in my own life?"</i>

27:45.955 --> 27:47.540
You're Jess's friend.

27:48.958 --> 27:50.377
From the hardware store.

27:51.086 --> 27:53.254
-The one with the camera.

27:56.257 --> 27:57.676
About the camera…

27:58.760 --> 28:01.096
I'm doing a project about the Visser.

28:01.179 --> 28:04.849
I was hoping you might
give me an interview sometime?

28:20.990 --> 28:22.867
You've got quite a library.

28:25.453 --> 28:27.414
People come here seeking answers.

28:28.540 --> 28:29.916
What's hiding in there?

28:30.667 --> 28:33.461
Set of <i>Nancy Drew? The Thorn Birds?</i>

28:35.255 --> 28:39.926
You'd be surprised how many forbidden
texts the Church keeps in its vaults.

28:40.552 --> 28:43.012
Books with dark secrets
from all over the world.

28:43.972 --> 28:45.974
Grimoires. Occult keys.

28:47.308 --> 28:49.811
There is great power
in knowing your enemy.

28:50.854 --> 28:53.440
So, how long
have you been at St. Albert's?

28:54.482 --> 28:57.902
I took over for Father McCormick in 1987.

28:58.987 --> 29:01.698
Attendance has dropped
in the past few years,

29:01.781 --> 29:05.034
but I try not to take it personally.

29:06.745 --> 29:10.498
Do you remember a parishioner
named Julia Bennett?

29:12.125 --> 29:14.169
I'm sorry, I don't think I do.

29:15.420 --> 29:16.463
No problem.

29:18.214 --> 29:22.177
Melody, I noticed
you didn't take the Eucharist.

29:23.636 --> 29:24.512
No.

29:25.096 --> 29:26.806
But you were raised Catholic.

29:28.141 --> 29:29.392
Catholic school.

29:31.019 --> 29:33.438
I got in so much trouble.

29:33.521 --> 29:37.025
I pretty much hand-copied
the entire New Testament.

29:37.108 --> 29:39.569
I didn't much care for school either.

29:39.652 --> 29:40.779
I…

29:41.780 --> 29:44.657
had a great deal of anger inside of me.

29:44.741 --> 29:46.826
A great deal of darkness.

29:46.910 --> 29:50.121
But after years
spent outside of God's grace,

29:50.205 --> 29:53.249
I realized the answers
were always right here.

29:54.918 --> 29:56.336
The Church is a light.

29:57.212 --> 30:02.300
And we need that light in a world
that can hold such darkness.

30:03.384 --> 30:05.553
Nice sentiment but…

30:07.013 --> 30:08.473
not my experience.

30:13.645 --> 30:15.522
How are you finding the Visser?

30:17.315 --> 30:19.067
I'm still getting settled.

30:20.735 --> 30:23.279
Have you noticed anything--

30:23.363 --> 30:24.989
Someone help me!

30:26.074 --> 30:27.367
Please, help!

30:28.243 --> 30:29.327
Jessica!

30:30.245 --> 30:33.122
It's okay. Listen. Listen to me.

30:33.206 --> 30:36.918
It's okay.
Listen to me. You're all right.

30:37.001 --> 30:38.503
You're in God's hands.

30:39.087 --> 30:41.214
You're in… You're in God's light.

30:41.297 --> 30:42.882
-Should I call an ambulance?
-No.

30:44.467 --> 30:46.302
In the name
of our Lord Jesus Christ,

30:46.386 --> 30:49.806
Lord, I beg you, release this girl
from the power of Satan.

30:55.603 --> 30:56.729
Take a breath.

30:59.899 --> 31:00.942
We're fine.

31:02.068 --> 31:04.112
-Everything's fine.
-Oh!

31:04.195 --> 31:07.323
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

31:18.960 --> 31:19.878
Oh, God.

31:21.504 --> 31:23.673
<i>She's 14, not 6.</i>

31:23.756 --> 31:27.135
<i>So what?</i>
<i>Bunnies always make me feel better.</i>

31:29.971 --> 31:32.932
<i>Maybe now her mother</i>
<i>will finally get her some real help.</i>

31:33.016 --> 31:35.685
<i>What did I say about strays?</i>

31:35.768 --> 31:38.313
<i>So I care about people.</i>

31:40.356 --> 31:42.442
<i>It's a feature, not a bug.</i>

31:42.525 --> 31:44.235
<i>What the fuck does that mean?</i>

31:50.909 --> 31:54.245
<i>It means I'm a good person.</i>

31:54.329 --> 31:56.205
<i>Of course you're a good person.</i>

31:56.289 --> 31:59.959
Hey, do you remember Auntie Mame
from the community room?

32:00.043 --> 32:01.294
Cassandra?

32:01.377 --> 32:05.465
Did you know that she is loaded
and an art collector?

32:05.548 --> 32:07.508
And she wants to see my stuff.

32:08.384 --> 32:09.385
Good.

32:10.511 --> 32:13.765
Maybe she'll buy something
and you could start kicking in for rent.

32:14.849 --> 32:18.019
I'm getting pretty good
at this Cassavetes shit.

32:18.102 --> 32:20.271
Maybe I should switch to filmmaking.

32:23.775 --> 32:24.859
Jess?

32:25.944 --> 32:27.236
Jess, it's me.

32:27.320 --> 32:31.199
<i>A chance for $5,000</i>
<i>here on </i>Supermarket Sweep!

32:32.325 --> 32:33.493
Help me!

32:34.953 --> 32:37.080
-Did you hear that?
-Yeah.

32:44.295 --> 32:45.254
Jess!

32:48.091 --> 32:49.425
Jess! Open up!

32:50.134 --> 32:52.971
Fucking television.
I'm gonna throw it in the incinerator.

32:55.348 --> 32:56.933
There's something wrong in there.

32:57.016 --> 32:59.268
Yeah, the priest is deaf.

32:59.352 --> 33:00.436
What priest?

33:00.520 --> 33:03.356
Father what's-his-name
from down the block.

33:03.439 --> 33:06.985
Every time he comes over, that fucking
television is blasting to Queens.

33:07.068 --> 33:09.028
We've gotta get in there. Now!

33:09.696 --> 33:12.115
I'm fucking serious! Call John Smith!

33:12.198 --> 33:14.617
I have a key.
Erika gave it to me for emergencies.

33:17.286 --> 33:18.329
Okay.

33:24.210 --> 33:25.378
What the fuck?

33:28.214 --> 33:31.092
…infernal invader, wicked legion.

33:31.175 --> 33:34.262
-What are you doing? Get out!
-In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ…

33:34.345 --> 33:35.263
The fuck are you doing?

33:35.346 --> 33:37.432
She has to purge.
She needs to expel this evil.

33:37.515 --> 33:38.516
Stop it!

33:38.599 --> 33:40.059
Stay back, let me finish!

33:40.143 --> 33:42.145
Finish what? Look at her! She's in pain!

33:42.228 --> 33:45.398
-You don't understand. I'm trying to help.
-You're trying to hurt her!

33:45.481 --> 33:47.525
-This isn't your business!
-Mel, come on.

33:47.608 --> 33:50.945
-Let's get the fuck out of here, okay?
-Mom, please, can we stop?

33:51.029 --> 33:51.863
-Please.
-Father--

33:51.946 --> 33:55.199
-We can't stop now. Courage, Erika.
-Enough!

33:58.453 --> 33:59.454
You're done here.

34:05.460 --> 34:06.461
Get off me!

34:06.544 --> 34:09.547
Hey. Hey, you're okay now.

34:10.173 --> 34:14.010
Okay? Yeah, you're safe. Okay?

34:16.929 --> 34:19.474
I know how much you love your daughter,

34:19.557 --> 34:22.226
but that man, that fraud,

34:23.227 --> 34:24.437
he can't treat her.

34:24.520 --> 34:27.315
Okay? I promise
I can get her some real help.

34:27.398 --> 34:29.400
I have colleagues at Columbia

34:29.484 --> 34:32.695
who are experts
in pediatric neurology, and I…

34:32.779 --> 34:34.822
I will cover any expenses.

34:35.364 --> 34:37.492
Please, just let me help you.

34:41.245 --> 34:43.581
Mom? Mom…

34:44.290 --> 34:45.666
Please.

34:48.795 --> 34:49.754
Please.

34:52.507 --> 34:55.551
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

34:59.347 --> 35:02.725
I thought you were different,
but you're just like all the rest,

35:02.809 --> 35:05.728
you and your bullshit medieval devil porn.

35:06.354 --> 35:08.356
She's sick, not possessed.

35:08.439 --> 35:10.983
You have no idea what's happening here.

35:11.651 --> 35:14.403
You think you're gonna find
whoever it is you're looking for?

35:15.071 --> 35:17.281
There is a terrible darkness here,

35:17.365 --> 35:19.242
whether you believe it or not.

35:20.034 --> 35:23.538
You should leave now,
while you're still able.

35:40.096 --> 35:41.180
<i>You okay?</i>

35:50.898 --> 35:52.316
<i>Anabelle, turn it off.</i>

36:42.700 --> 36:43.993
Oh, fuck.

36:46.871 --> 36:47.705
Hey.

36:47.788 --> 36:49.790
How was the trip? Did you talk to her?

36:49.874 --> 36:50.875
Uh…

36:53.794 --> 36:55.296
She… She didn't show.

36:55.922 --> 36:57.673
Sorry, I, uh, I went to her place.

36:57.757 --> 36:59.634
<i>No one was there. Uh…</i>

36:59.717 --> 37:02.303
<i>I left a note.</i>
<i>Maybe she got spooked. Sorry.</i>

37:02.386 --> 37:03.304
Oh.

37:05.139 --> 37:07.558
Yeah, I'll go back in a couple days. Um…

37:08.392 --> 37:11.020
Did you get yourself
back into that basement?

37:11.103 --> 37:13.773
<i>Turns out there's</i>
<i>a groundskeeper here, Bobbi.</i>

37:13.856 --> 37:15.983
<i>I convinced her to open the chapel for me.</i>

37:16.067 --> 37:19.070
<i>I told her I needed some space</i>
<i>for spiritual contemplation.</i>

37:19.153 --> 37:22.490
Ah. So, let me guess, there's no
surveillance cameras in the chapel then.

37:22.573 --> 37:25.952
No cameras, but it does have
an entrance to the tunnels.

37:34.377 --> 37:36.796
Well, isn't there a camera
down there, though?

37:36.879 --> 37:39.882
I recorded seven hours of empty corridor.

37:42.301 --> 37:44.220
<i>Looped it back into the feed.</i>

37:45.388 --> 37:47.932
<i>An empty hallway</i>
<i>is all Davenport's ever gonna see.</i>

37:48.015 --> 37:51.018
Now I just need a way
to get a code for the door.

37:51.644 --> 37:53.521
<i>I guess it's tomorrow's problem.</i>

37:58.567 --> 38:00.611
I feel like you've been
holding out on me, man.

38:00.695 --> 38:03.030
We could've been
<i>Ocean's Eleven-ing </i>shit all these years.

38:03.114 --> 38:04.740
Well, I'm only halfway there.

38:07.910 --> 38:08.869
I lied.

38:10.538 --> 38:11.414
What?

38:13.582 --> 38:16.210
I lied about Melody. I, uh…

38:17.503 --> 38:20.047
I did talk to her, man. Fuck, I'm sorry.

38:21.549 --> 38:23.092
Okay, what happened?

38:23.175 --> 38:24.343
It wasn't her.

38:25.136 --> 38:26.721
What do you mean, it wasn't her?

38:27.638 --> 38:29.473
<i>She bought Melody's identity.</i>

38:29.557 --> 38:33.019
<i>She had enough details to fool anyone</i>
<i>that might come looking and, um…</i>

38:33.853 --> 38:36.647
<i>Basically she'd been in a car accident,</i>
<i>had some really bad burns.</i>

38:36.731 --> 38:40.735
<i>She couldn't get her life together,</i>
<i>so she stole someone else's.</i>

38:41.736 --> 38:44.905
You told me to be a human being,
so I told her I wouldn't give her up.

38:48.200 --> 38:50.828
Okay, so… so you keep looking.

38:52.413 --> 38:54.165
Dan, you impersonate someone,

38:54.248 --> 38:55.916
you collect their disability,
unemployment.

38:56.000 --> 38:57.585
I mean, the only way that works…

38:59.045 --> 39:01.213
<i>is if the real person's dead.</i>

39:01.839 --> 39:02.757
<i>There's…</i>

39:03.841 --> 39:08.637
<i>no one to contest the stolen ID</i>
<i>or use that social security number.</i>

39:10.848 --> 39:12.183
<i>I'm sorry, man. I…</i>

39:13.184 --> 39:15.394
<i>I know how important this was to you.</i>

39:15.978 --> 39:17.813
Are you okay? I can come up there and--

39:17.897 --> 39:19.940
It's fine. I'm gonna, um…

39:21.442 --> 39:24.028
Uh, thanks for making the trip.
I'll talk to you later.

39:29.825 --> 39:31.911
<i>Bunnies always</i>
<i>make me feel better.</i>

39:34.497 --> 39:37.458
<i>Maybe now her mother</i>
<i>will finally get her some real help.</i>

39:37.541 --> 39:40.378
<i>What did I say about strays?</i>

39:40.461 --> 39:42.797
<i>So I care about people.</i>

39:44.965 --> 39:46.926
<i>It's a feature, not a bug.</i>

39:55.393 --> 39:56.310
<i>Hey.</i>

40:00.356 --> 40:01.607
<i>You came.</i>

40:08.572 --> 40:09.532
<i>Cheers.</i>

40:16.956 --> 40:17.915
Cheers.

40:20.626 --> 40:24.880
<i>So, I've been thinking about</i>
<i>what you said about helping people.</i>

40:27.925 --> 40:28.884
<i>It was…</i>

40:31.637 --> 40:35.307
<i>I really needed to hear that.</i>
<i>So, thank you.</i>

40:39.812 --> 40:41.313
Is this really happening?

40:44.608 --> 40:46.318
<i>Why wouldn't it be happening?</i>

40:47.403 --> 40:49.738
-<i>Hey! Fuck you!</i>

40:49.822 --> 40:52.324
-<i>Fucking Anabelle.</i>
<i>Hey!</i>

40:52.408 --> 40:53.993
<i>-Hey, asshole!</i>
<i>-I'm sorry.</i>

40:54.076 --> 40:57.788
<i>Can you hold on just a second?</i>
<i>I'll be right back.</i>

40:58.622 --> 40:59.790
<i>Don't go.</i>

41:05.921 --> 41:08.841
-<i> You're dead, asshole!</i>
-<i>I don't care what you say!</i>

41:08.924 --> 41:11.427
<i>-Get outta here!</i>
-<i>Anabelle, what are you doing?</i>

42:08.859 --> 42:12.029
<i>Stay out.</i>
