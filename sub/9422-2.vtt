00:00.100 --> 00:04.003
(Woman) Tonight on...

00:04.070 --> 00:07.040
Behind the scenes of americas
favorite controversial family--

00:07.107 --> 00:09.009
the Darlings.

00:09.076 --> 00:11.011
For decades, we've cheered
their victories,

00:11.078 --> 00:13.046
mourned their losses
and relished the lurid scandals

00:13.113 --> 00:15.983
that seem to follow America's
first family everywhere.

00:16.049 --> 00:18.018
We thought the Darling dynasty
couldn't get dirtier,

00:18.085 --> 00:21.955
but just last week,
tragic lightning struck twice.

00:22.022 --> 00:23.957
First,
New York Attorney General

00:24.024 --> 00:25.993
Patrick Darlings
beloved wife Ellen

00:26.059 --> 00:27.961
perished
in a suspicious fire

00:28.028 --> 00:29.963
at the family’s country estate,

00:30.030 --> 00:32.966
leading the Darlings to retreat
en masse to the imperial,

00:33.033 --> 00:34.034
their palatial Manhattan home,

00:34.101 --> 00:36.003
where they’ve remained
in seclusion...

00:36.069 --> 00:38.939
Margaux, turn that off.
We're still eating.

00:39.006 --> 00:40.007
We want to see.

00:40.073 --> 00:42.943
Why would you want
to watch that garbage?

00:43.010 --> 00:45.946
Lindsey dallamuir's mom
says you killed mommy.

00:46.013 --> 00:47.948
Dude...

00:48.015 --> 00:50.984
Are you serious?
Lots of people
are saying it.

00:51.051 --> 00:52.986
This is why I'm never
having kids.

00:53.053 --> 00:55.923
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
listen to me, both of you,

00:55.989 --> 00:57.991
what happened to your mother
was an accident.

00:58.058 --> 01:00.994
Even the police said so.

01:01.061 --> 01:04.965
I-I loved your mommy...
Very much. You know that.

01:05.032 --> 01:07.968
... while others ask,
was this really an accident?

01:08.035 --> 01:10.003
Meanwhile,
wall street insiders are saying

01:10.070 --> 01:12.940
Darling enterprises
may be facing troubled times.

01:13.006 --> 01:14.007
Analysts have downgraded
D. E. Stock

01:14.074 --> 01:16.009
in the wake of what may be

01:16.076 --> 01:18.946
the biggest
Darling bombshell ever...
Mr. Darling.

01:19.012 --> 01:20.981
The arrest
of Darling matriarch...
The board will see you now.

01:21.048 --> 01:22.983
Letitia Darling for the murder
of Dutch George,

01:23.050 --> 01:24.051
the family’s lawyer.

01:24.117 --> 01:25.986
Dutch’s son, Nick George,

01:26.053 --> 01:27.988
who now serves the family
in a similar capacity,

01:28.055 --> 01:29.990
spoke to reporters.
Who will represent
Mrs. Darling?

01:30.057 --> 01:32.025
Terry deramian will serve
as defense counsel

01:32.092 --> 01:33.994
for Mrs. Darling.

01:34.061 --> 01:36.029
Mr. Deramian's stellar record

01:36.096 --> 01:37.965
as America's premier
defense attorney

01:38.031 --> 01:39.032
gives us every confidence

01:39.099 --> 01:41.969
Mrs. Darling
will be found innocent.

01:42.035 --> 01:45.005
And she will be,
make no mistake.
Mr. George, Mr. George,

01:45.072 --> 01:46.940
you've enjoyed
a close relationship

01:47.007 --> 01:49.042
with the Darlings for decades,
but now that your own father

01:49.109 --> 01:51.945
is the alleged victim
in a Darling murder case,

01:52.012 --> 01:54.014
do you believe
in the Darling curse?

01:54.081 --> 01:56.016
Well, the only curse
I know about

01:56.083 --> 01:58.018
is being asked
questions like that.

01:58.085 --> 01:59.987
(Reporters all shouting
at once)

02:00.053 --> 02:02.022
Thank you all very much.
No further questions.

02:02.089 --> 02:04.992
Someone looks cute on TV.

02:05.058 --> 02:06.994
Yeah, you can see me
in high def.

02:07.060 --> 02:08.961
(Laughs)

02:09.029 --> 02:11.031
Mayor Bloomberg, Nick George.

02:11.098 --> 02:13.000
I just wanted to thank you

02:13.066 --> 02:15.936
on behalf
of the Darling family...
(Whispers) Bloomberg?

02:16.003 --> 02:17.938
For making
this tribute possible.

02:18.005 --> 02:19.006
I will pass that on.

02:19.072 --> 02:21.975
Thank you. Bye.

02:22.042 --> 02:24.978
He's coming
to Ellen's service?
Oh, I don't know. We'll see.

02:25.045 --> 02:26.947
He'll probably skip it
like everybody else

02:27.014 --> 02:28.949
and show up at Letitia's trial.
It's juicier.

02:29.016 --> 02:31.952
Well, a person can only make it
to so many Darling debacles.

02:32.019 --> 02:35.956
Are you sure you don't want me
to come to the arraignment?
Oh, yeah.
It's not gonna be any fun.

02:36.023 --> 02:37.991
The whole family's
pretty freaked.

02:38.058 --> 02:41.028
I'm gonna be holding
a lot of hands.
Who'll be holding yours?

02:41.094 --> 02:43.931
I don't know. I hear
Jeremy's gonna be there.

02:43.997 --> 02:46.967
I know how fond he is
of our family.
You said
you weren't angry anymore.

02:47.034 --> 02:49.937
I'm not. It doesn't mean I don't
remember that you kissed Jeremy.

02:50.003 --> 02:51.939
Forgiveness isn't amnesia.

02:52.005 --> 02:54.007
(Sighs)

02:54.074 --> 02:56.977
Come here.

02:57.044 --> 02:59.079
Come here.

03:02.082 --> 03:04.952
Remember that thing
we talked about doing?

03:05.018 --> 03:07.988
You talked about.

03:08.055 --> 03:10.958
You're bringing that up now?

03:11.024 --> 03:13.060
You're the one who said
you wanted to have another kid.

03:13.126 --> 03:15.062
Nick,
I'm still in this marriage

03:15.128 --> 03:16.997
for the long haul.

03:17.064 --> 03:20.033
Come on. Let's--
let's have a baby.

03:20.100 --> 03:22.970
All right. Let's talk
about this later, all right?

03:23.036 --> 03:25.939
I've got a roomful of Darlings
waiting for me to help them

03:26.006 --> 03:27.941
figure out what
the entertainment is gonna be

03:28.008 --> 03:29.943
for Ellen's memorial service.
My God.

03:30.010 --> 03:32.012
Is there anything these people
won't ask you to do?

03:32.079 --> 03:36.950
I'm amazed they haven't asked
you to take Letitia's case.
Mm, no, I guess even
the Darlings have their limits.

03:37.017 --> 03:39.052
I want Nick
to defend your mother.

03:39.119 --> 03:40.988
What?

03:41.054 --> 03:42.990
What about this
million-dollar deramian guy

03:43.056 --> 03:44.958
that Nick recommended?

03:45.025 --> 03:48.929
No, Nick was right to
bring him on as a bridge,

03:48.996 --> 03:51.932
but now Mr. deramian
should make a graceful exit,

03:51.999 --> 03:54.001
and Nick should take over
the case.

03:54.067 --> 03:57.004
You really expect him
to stand up in court

03:57.070 --> 03:58.972
and defend the woman

03:59.039 --> 04:02.976
who's accused of murdering
his father, my father?

04:03.043 --> 04:05.979
That woman is your mother.

04:06.046 --> 04:11.018
She did not commit this crime.
She must not go to jail.

04:11.084 --> 04:14.021
What jury could possibly
convict her

04:14.087 --> 04:18.058
if she's being defended
by the victim's son?

04:22.095 --> 04:23.997
Something's troubling you.

04:24.064 --> 04:25.999
What did the board
have to say?

04:26.066 --> 04:28.001
They're not happy.
No?

04:28.068 --> 04:30.971
They want you
to name a successor.

04:31.038 --> 04:33.006
Your mother is the vice chair.
They know,

04:33.073 --> 04:36.009
and they all think she's going
up the river tout de suite.

04:36.076 --> 04:38.011
(Chuckles) They do, do they?

04:38.078 --> 04:40.981
Well, I suppose putting forward
a succession plan

04:41.048 --> 04:44.952
might stabilize the stock
until your mother's acquittal.

04:45.018 --> 04:46.987
You seem pretty optimistic.

04:47.054 --> 04:48.922
I am.

04:48.989 --> 04:50.991
Your mother
will be proven innocent....

04:51.058 --> 04:55.095
Just so long
as Nick takes the case.

04:57.097 --> 05:00.000
Okay, you have to go.

05:00.067 --> 05:01.034
What?

05:01.101 --> 05:03.971
You can't keep me up
until 5:15 in the morning,

05:04.037 --> 05:06.974
then throw me out
on the street at... 8:05.

05:07.040 --> 05:08.976
My day doesn't start
till noon.

05:09.042 --> 05:10.978
I have to get to work.

05:11.044 --> 05:13.981
What do you even do?

05:14.047 --> 05:15.983
I've been so busy...
Mmm.

05:16.049 --> 05:17.985
Mapping your bod

05:18.051 --> 05:19.987

05:23.090 --> 05:25.993
Oh.

05:32.032 --> 05:32.966
Mm.

05:33.033 --> 05:34.968
Mm.

05:35.035 --> 05:38.038
Just remember,
whatever happens...

05:38.105 --> 05:40.974
Every moment we've had
has been completely real,

05:41.041 --> 05:43.043
and I like you a lot.

05:43.110 --> 05:47.014
(Whispers) I really do.

05:49.116 --> 05:50.984
What does that mean?

05:51.051 --> 05:53.086
It means... see you later.

05:58.091 --> 06:00.928
Okay, after Patrick's eulogy,

06:00.994 --> 06:02.930
it was suggested
there be a song.

06:02.996 --> 06:03.997
Choir, soloist?

06:04.064 --> 06:05.999
What about Elton John?

06:06.066 --> 06:08.035
Mm.
He'll play "candle in the wind"
for anyone.

06:08.101 --> 06:10.003
Genius.

06:10.070 --> 06:11.939
Patrick, was there anyone

06:12.005 --> 06:14.041
who's music Ellen was
particularly fond of?

06:14.107 --> 06:15.976
Kenny G?

06:16.043 --> 06:19.046
(Gasps)
That is so Ellen.

06:19.112 --> 06:21.014
I'll call Kenny G.

Hi, daddy.
Hello, my Darling girl.

06:27.988 --> 06:30.023
Brian has just told me
that the board

06:30.090 --> 06:33.961
has become fearful
for the future of the company,

06:34.027 --> 06:36.964
and they are going to demand
that I choose a new vice chair

06:37.030 --> 06:38.031
to replace your mother.

06:38.098 --> 06:41.001
A successor.

06:41.068 --> 06:43.036
Exactly,
and I'm your father.

06:43.103 --> 06:46.940
I have an equal and imperishable
love for each of you.

06:47.007 --> 06:49.943
I--I'm not capable
of making that decision.

06:50.010 --> 06:52.980
So I'm going to need someone
that I trust to make it for me,

06:53.046 --> 06:54.982

06:55.048 --> 06:57.017
better suited to determine
the future of the company

06:57.084 --> 06:59.987

I have entrusted the task

10:06.073 --> 10:08.108
(Both speak indistinctly)

10:10.077 --> 10:12.946
On behalf of my client,
your honor,

10:13.013 --> 10:15.015
uh, we enter a plea
of not guilty.

10:15.082 --> 10:16.049
Objection.

10:16.116 --> 10:18.018
Already?

10:18.085 --> 10:20.053
Your honor, Mr. deramian
is an out-of-state lawyer,

10:20.120 --> 10:22.956
and as such, needs
the sponsorship of local counsel

10:23.023 --> 10:24.057
in order to appear
before this court.

10:24.124 --> 10:27.027
I had, uh, that paperwork filed
with the clerk yesterday,

10:27.094 --> 10:29.963
your honor.
That may be the case,

10:30.030 --> 10:31.064
but Ms. lyons
seems to be correct.

10:31.131 --> 10:34.001
It didn't make it
to the actual file.

10:34.067 --> 10:36.036
This hearing is adjourned.

10:36.103 --> 10:38.972
Mrs. Darling will be
remanded into custody until--
your honor, your--

10:39.039 --> 10:42.009
(Patrick)
You want me to take care--
no, no, no.
Nick will take care of it.

10:42.075 --> 10:45.012
Nick?

10:45.078 --> 10:46.980
Your honor, Nick George,

10:47.047 --> 10:49.950
general counsel
for the Darling family.
Congratulations. Sit down.

10:50.017 --> 10:51.952
I am prepared to act
as local counsel

10:52.019 --> 10:54.988
until Mr. deramian can file
the necessary paperwork.
Fine.

10:55.055 --> 10:57.057
I'll let it go today,
but please be sure

10:57.124 --> 11:00.027
to file those papers properly,
Mr. deramian.
Absolutely, your honor.

11:00.093 --> 11:01.995
You, Mr. George,
may proceed.

11:02.062 --> 11:03.997
We humbly ask
that bail be waived

11:04.064 --> 11:06.033
and Mrs. Darling be allowed
to remain free

11:06.099 --> 11:10.003
on her own recognizance.
Objection. Your honor,
the defendant is clearly--

11:10.070 --> 11:14.007
your honor, Mrs. Darling
has no previous--
your honor, do you really
want to send the message

11:14.074 --> 11:16.009
that the rich
are above the law?

11:16.076 --> 11:17.945
She's got a gulfstream v

11:18.011 --> 11:20.047
gassed up and waiting for her
at Teterboro.

11:20.113 --> 11:22.983
Bail is set in the amount
of $20 million.

11:23.050 --> 11:25.986
The defendant will remain
in custody until bond is posted.
(Clears throat)

11:26.053 --> 11:28.989
(Bangs gavel)
(Sighs) Your honor, I know
this is highly irregular,

11:29.056 --> 11:31.925
but we have taken it
upon ourselves

11:31.992 --> 11:33.927
to contact the Darlings'
private bank,

11:33.994 --> 11:35.929
and bail will be paid
forthwith.

11:35.996 --> 11:37.998
(Door opens)

11:38.065 --> 11:42.002
(The fratellis'"tell me a lie"
playing)

11:42.069 --> 11:45.973
♪ Ah ♪

11:46.039 --> 11:46.974
Wow.

11:47.040 --> 11:49.009
First time I've seen that.

11:49.076 --> 11:52.045
Mrs. Darling,
you are free to go,

11:52.112 --> 11:54.982
but you will be under
strict house arrest

11:55.048 --> 11:57.050
until further notice.
Next.
(Bangs gavel)

11:57.117 --> 11:58.986
Well, I don't know

11:59.052 --> 12:00.988
what the hell went wrong
with those papers.

12:01.054 --> 12:03.924
Did you get a proof
of service from the clerk?
Yeah, of course I did.

12:03.991 --> 12:05.993
But damned if I know
where it got to.

12:06.059 --> 12:09.029
Well, that's all right.
Things happen.

12:09.096 --> 12:12.032
It's a pity that the only thing
that went off flawlessly

12:12.099 --> 12:15.002
was the shameless parade
of our wealth.

12:15.068 --> 12:16.937
Where are we going?

12:17.004 --> 12:18.939
This is a little
back way

12:19.006 --> 12:21.008
I Daniel booned
during the Mangold trial.

12:21.074 --> 12:24.011
Should be quiet
as a church.

12:24.077 --> 12:25.979
(All shouting at once)

12:26.046 --> 12:27.981
(Tripp)
What the hell is that?

12:28.048 --> 12:29.917
Well, this is a little
disappointing.

12:29.983 --> 12:31.985
Did you murder Dutch George?
What can you tell us?

12:32.052 --> 12:34.922
(Nick) Where's the car?
Did yo plan this?
Terry, is this going to be
a repeat

12:34.988 --> 12:36.924
of the Harvey Sutton trial?
My client
is completely innocent...

12:36.990 --> 12:38.959
Where hell's the car, Terry?
Just as Harvey Sutton
was innocent,

12:39.026 --> 12:41.028
despite
his subsequent confession.

12:41.094 --> 12:44.998
Hey, Clark, can you get
the car back here now, please?
Letitia, you've managed

12:45.065 --> 12:48.936
to live outside of the spotlight
for over 30 years--
are you going to take
the stand in your own defense?

12:49.002 --> 12:50.938
Has the reality of the situation
sunk in yet?
Nick.

12:51.004 --> 12:52.973
(Cries)
I just want to go home!

12:53.040 --> 12:56.109
♪♪♪

13:02.082 --> 13:03.951
(Sighs)

13:04.017 --> 13:05.052
Nothing personal?

13:05.118 --> 13:07.955
Don't be a hater.

13:08.021 --> 13:10.023
You hooked up with me
and then arrested my mom.
It's called a hit-and-run.

13:10.090 --> 13:12.926
Oh, I thought it was called
a setup.

13:12.993 --> 13:13.927
Jeremy.

13:13.994 --> 13:15.929
It's not a setup,
then what is it,

13:15.996 --> 13:18.932
some sort of evil plan to
use me, get secret information?

13:18.999 --> 13:21.001
If it was, I would've
asked you a few questions,

13:21.068 --> 13:23.003
don't you think?

13:23.070 --> 13:24.004
Yeah.

13:24.071 --> 13:26.006
The only thing
I remember asking

13:26.073 --> 13:28.008
was for you to do
a certain thing

13:28.075 --> 13:31.044
a little bit harder.

13:31.111 --> 13:34.047
I told you
everything was real.

13:34.114 --> 13:38.018
I like you a lot.
It's just complicated.

13:40.053 --> 13:42.990
I want to see you tonight.
We need to talk about this.

13:43.056 --> 13:45.993
File that under
"not gonna happen."

13:46.059 --> 13:51.031
It was great
while it lasted.

13:59.039 --> 14:01.975
That degree of mayhem

14:02.042 --> 14:03.977
could never
have been predicted, Tripp.

14:04.044 --> 14:07.948
And what about those papers
that you failed to file?

14:08.015 --> 14:09.983
Or the fact that you were
standing there preening

14:10.050 --> 14:11.985
in the silvery light
of the cameras

14:12.052 --> 14:14.021
while barely
a foot away from you,

14:14.087 --> 14:17.991
my beloved wife was unraveling
like tape from a cassette?

14:18.058 --> 14:21.028
I don't care how many
shoddy heiresses you've returned

14:21.094 --> 14:23.964
from the gnawing jaws
of justice

14:24.031 --> 14:26.967
to the safety
of their infinity pools.

14:27.034 --> 14:31.004
You will not be defending
my wife.

14:32.105 --> 14:34.074
Fine.

14:43.116 --> 14:45.986
You ready to take
this case?

14:46.053 --> 14:48.989
Brian, if you think
heading into a court with me--

14:49.056 --> 14:53.026
the victim's son--
as her lawyer is gonna fly--
it exonerates her by design.

14:53.093 --> 14:56.964
No, it doesn't. It makes us look
like we're all in bed together.

14:57.030 --> 14:59.032
Yeah, that's true.
That's true.

15:01.068 --> 15:03.003
I'll have a new list
of attorneys

15:03.070 --> 15:04.972
for you in the morning.

15:05.038 --> 15:07.007
(Tripp) Thank you.

15:12.045 --> 15:15.015
Excuse me.

15:17.084 --> 15:19.019
What's going on?

15:19.086 --> 15:23.056
All will be well,
my Darling.

15:23.123 --> 15:26.026
Just wait.

15:28.095 --> 15:30.030
There's not an argument
you can make

15:30.097 --> 15:31.965
that'll change my mind,
Brian.

15:32.032 --> 15:33.033
I'm not taking the case.

15:33.100 --> 15:34.968
I can't believe you.

15:35.035 --> 15:37.037
We ask you
one friggin' thing...

15:37.104 --> 15:39.973
Brian, you ask me
to do everything.
Why shouldn't we?

15:40.040 --> 15:42.042
You don't think you owe
this family?

15:42.109 --> 15:46.013
Your whole life, we've treated
you like a friggin' prince.
A prince?
I'm the cleanup crew, Brian.

15:46.079 --> 15:48.982
I'm the guy
who clears your tickets,

15:49.049 --> 15:50.951
plans your funerals
and calls Kenny G.

15:51.018 --> 15:52.986
Oh, and in between chores,
I have to decide

15:53.053 --> 15:55.022
which one of you spoiled brats
gets to inherit the kingdom.

15:55.088 --> 15:56.957
And, oh, yes, on occasion,

15:57.024 --> 15:58.959
I'm invited to sit
at the main table,

15:59.026 --> 16:01.028
but that's just until
somebody drops their plate

16:01.094 --> 16:04.965
and I'm sent to fetch a mop.
Well,
that's what family is.

16:05.032 --> 16:06.967
We're all expendable
until we're needed.

16:07.034 --> 16:09.002
At least you get paid
for it.

16:09.069 --> 16:12.973
Brian, get this straight--
I'm not taking this case,

16:13.040 --> 16:15.976
now or ever.

16:26.019 --> 16:27.921
(Patrick)
You wanted to see me, dad?

16:27.988 --> 16:28.989
(Tripp) Yeah, paddy.

16:29.056 --> 16:30.991
Uh, have you given
some thought

16:31.058 --> 16:33.026
as to what
you're going to say?

16:33.093 --> 16:36.930
At Ellen's memorial service?

16:36.997 --> 16:40.968
This eulogy could be
a real milestone

16:41.034 --> 16:43.036
in your political life.

16:43.103 --> 16:46.039
Dad, it's bad enough that
we covered up Ellen's death.

16:46.106 --> 16:49.009
Do we really
have to capitalize on it?

16:49.076 --> 16:51.011
We don't have to, no.

16:51.078 --> 16:53.013
One wonders, though,

16:53.080 --> 16:57.017
who precisely is best served
by missing this opportunity.

16:57.084 --> 17:00.020
Certainly not Ellen.

17:00.087 --> 17:03.056
She wanted nothing more than
for you to win this election.

17:03.123 --> 17:04.992
You know that.

17:05.058 --> 17:07.961
What am I supposed to
get up there and say?

17:08.028 --> 17:13.000
Share the pain of this...
Unthinkable loss...

17:13.066 --> 17:17.003
A-and be a human being.

17:18.105 --> 17:22.041
(Chuckles) A human being.

17:22.108 --> 17:25.045
I'll try.

17:25.112 --> 17:27.948
Afternoon, counselor.

17:28.015 --> 17:29.950
Oh, what do you want?

17:30.017 --> 17:31.952
You're not Letitia's
lawyer now, are you?

17:32.019 --> 17:32.986
'Cause that would be gross.

17:33.053 --> 17:35.923
No, I'm not, but I still
represent the family,

17:35.989 --> 17:37.925
and the family
would like Letitia

17:37.991 --> 17:39.927
to attend Ellen's
memorial service tomorrow.

17:39.993 --> 17:41.995
She's under house arrest.
Come on.
Give her an exemption.

17:42.062 --> 17:43.997
She should be in jail,
and by the way,

17:44.064 --> 17:46.967
no need to thank me for finding
your father's murderer.

17:47.034 --> 17:50.037
How did you end up on
the wrong side of this fight?
What kind of case
have you got?

17:50.103 --> 17:52.973
Golden--a 40-year affair
gone bad,

17:53.040 --> 17:55.008
a plane that's been tampered
with, an eager witness

17:55.075 --> 17:57.010
and a juicy chance
to arrest her again

17:57.077 --> 17:59.947
if she shows her face
outdoors.
You wouldn't dare.

18:00.013 --> 18:02.082
Mm. Try me.

18:07.020 --> 18:10.023
You're kinda late, Nick.

18:10.090 --> 18:12.025
Well, gee.
I'm really sorry, Karen.

18:12.092 --> 18:15.996
I just got all caught up
in trying to find someone

18:16.063 --> 18:18.999
to defend your mother
in a murder trial.

18:19.066 --> 18:21.068
(Exhales deeply)
Let me guess.

18:21.134 --> 18:24.004
You're here because
you want me to pick you

18:24.071 --> 18:26.006
to take over the company.
Oh, let me guess.

18:26.073 --> 18:28.976
You weren't even going to
consider me, were you?
Come on, Karen.

18:29.042 --> 18:31.044
I am well-aware
of all your virtues--

18:31.111 --> 18:33.981
your business experience, your
work with the family foundation.

18:34.047 --> 18:36.016
I promise you I'm gonna take
all those things

18:36.083 --> 18:38.986
into consideration
as I make a decision, okay?

18:39.052 --> 18:41.989
Done.
You're not gonna pick me.

18:42.055 --> 18:43.056
Come on, Karen.
(Laughs) Oh.

18:43.123 --> 18:45.993
You know, I don't want
to pick anybody.

18:46.059 --> 18:49.062
I got handed
this live grenade--
you're not gonna pick me.
It's that simple.

18:49.129 --> 18:52.032
If I had known
when we were 10 years old

18:52.099 --> 18:54.968
that letting you see me
with my shirt off

18:55.035 --> 18:56.970
was gonna cost me
the company,

18:57.037 --> 18:59.006
I never would've done it.

18:59.072 --> 19:02.042
But I guess
I didn't know you then.

19:02.109 --> 19:06.013
And I don't know you now,
Nick.

19:08.081 --> 19:10.017
Karen...

19:10.083 --> 19:11.952
(Door slams)

19:12.019 --> 19:13.954
(Karen) I'm going to kill him.

19:14.021 --> 19:17.024
I'm seriously
going to kill him.
Ah, he might still
recommend you.

19:17.090 --> 19:18.959
No, he won't.

19:19.026 --> 19:21.028
Once you see a person a certain
way, that's how you see them.

19:21.094 --> 19:22.996
Nick doesn't
take me seriously.

19:23.063 --> 19:24.998
I don't know.
How could he not?

19:25.065 --> 19:27.935
Ask him. (Sighs)

19:28.001 --> 19:30.938
You know what? I think
I might just do that.

19:31.004 --> 19:33.974
No. See? I was kidding.
No, no, no. No, no,
listen to me.

19:34.041 --> 19:35.976
Karen,
I got to where I am today

19:36.043 --> 19:38.979
by recognizing and utilizing
not only my own talents

19:39.046 --> 19:40.047
but the talents of others.

19:40.113 --> 19:43.016
Nick, because he has
a history with you,

19:43.083 --> 19:46.019
might not be able to see
all of your gifts

19:46.086 --> 19:48.956
like I do.

19:49.022 --> 19:51.024
Let me talk to him.

19:51.091 --> 19:53.026
Okay. (Laughs)

19:53.093 --> 19:54.027
Okay.

19:54.094 --> 19:55.028
Okay.

19:55.095 --> 19:56.997
(Door opens)

19:57.064 --> 20:00.033
Patrick, I assure you,
I'm taking

20:00.100 --> 20:02.970
all your leadership qualities
into consideration

20:03.036 --> 20:04.972
as I make a decision, okay?

20:05.038 --> 20:06.974
Nick, I don't care about
the company.

20:07.040 --> 20:08.976
That's not why I'm here.

20:09.042 --> 20:11.044
Oh, okay.
So what's up?

20:11.111 --> 20:13.947
Well, dad wants me to write
a heartfelt eulogy

20:14.014 --> 20:15.015
for Ellen's memorial.

20:15.082 --> 20:17.017
He thinks it'll clinch
the election.

20:17.084 --> 20:19.052
He's probably not wrong,
regrettably.

20:19.119 --> 20:22.923
Well, I'm--I'm having
a real tough time.
With what, finding the words?

20:22.990 --> 20:24.992
The words? (Chuckles)
Try the feelings.

20:25.058 --> 20:27.060
And this damn thing's
tomorrow.

20:27.127 --> 20:29.963
Patrick, you had two children
with the woman.

20:30.030 --> 20:31.999
I mean, you must have
some feelings for her.

20:32.065 --> 20:34.001
She tried to kill me
with a fire poker, Nick.

20:34.067 --> 20:36.069
And before that, she shot me
in the leg, remember?

20:36.136 --> 20:39.006
I mean, call me callous here--
I hear you. I hear you.

20:39.072 --> 20:41.008
What am I supposed to do?

20:41.074 --> 20:43.043
I-I keep trying
to come up with things,

20:43.110 --> 20:46.947
and all I can think about
is... Carmelita.
Wait a minute. Are you two
seeing each other again?

20:47.014 --> 20:49.983
No, no. She's still missing,
but she's all I...

20:50.050 --> 20:51.952
Ever think about.

20:52.019 --> 20:54.955
Well, pat, if--if she's really
all that you can think about,

20:55.022 --> 20:56.990
why don't you try
writing it about her?

20:57.057 --> 20:58.025
Carmelita?

20:58.091 --> 21:00.994
You write it about Carmelita,

21:01.061 --> 21:05.032
then you can replace her name
with Ellen's when you're done.

21:07.034 --> 21:08.035
That's a great idea.

21:08.101 --> 21:09.970
All right.

21:10.037 --> 21:11.972
That's a great idea. Great.
Good.

21:12.039 --> 21:13.040
That was easy.

21:13.106 --> 21:15.943
Good to see you. Yeah.
You, too.

21:16.009 --> 21:17.945
Oh, and by the way, Nick,
you, uh,

21:18.011 --> 21:19.046
you are gonna pick me,
right?

21:19.112 --> 21:20.981
Write the speech, pat.

21:21.048 --> 21:22.049
Oh.

21:22.115 --> 21:24.051
That's fair.

21:29.990 --> 21:32.025
Hey, Nick. (Laughs)

21:32.092 --> 21:34.995
Glad I caught you.
Hope I can say the same.

21:35.062 --> 21:37.998
Yeah, hey, can I talk
to you for a second?
Yeah.

21:38.065 --> 21:40.000
I'll--I'll cut to the chase.
I-I need a favor.

21:40.067 --> 21:43.971
It's about Karen.
Come on, Simon. Lobbying
on behalf of family members?

21:44.037 --> 21:45.973
Just hear me--
hear me out. Please.

21:46.039 --> 21:49.042
We both know Karen.
She's a great girl.

21:49.109 --> 21:52.012
She's got a lot
of amazing qualities.
Agreed.

21:52.079 --> 21:53.947
But let's be honest.

21:54.014 --> 21:55.983
Running a billion-dollar,
multinational corporation

21:56.049 --> 21:57.985
isn't one of 'em.

21:58.051 --> 21:59.987
Now I'm in a tight spot.

22:00.053 --> 22:02.022
Karen asked me
to talk to you

22:02.089 --> 22:04.958
because...
She doesn't trust you

22:05.025 --> 22:07.961
to make a fair decision
in this matter.

22:08.028 --> 22:10.964
I-I-I don't think she trusts you
on much of anything anymore.

22:11.031 --> 22:12.966
Now li--I--look, I was
reluctant to get involved,

22:13.033 --> 22:14.034
but we know Karen.

22:14.101 --> 22:16.003
She wants what she wants.

22:16.069 --> 22:18.005
I mean, last week she wanted
a-a Fendi bag.

22:18.071 --> 22:21.008
This week she wants
Darling enterprises.
Why are you telling me this?

22:21.074 --> 22:23.010
Because I told her
I'd talk to you.

22:23.076 --> 22:25.979
But when push comes to shove,
I can't, in good conscience,

22:26.046 --> 22:28.982
sell you something
you're too smart to buy.

22:29.049 --> 22:31.018
So just do me this favor.

22:31.084 --> 22:33.020
If she ever asks you
what I said,

22:33.086 --> 22:36.023
just try not to sell me
completely down the river.

22:36.089 --> 22:37.958
(Chuckles) Okay?

22:38.025 --> 22:38.959
Okay.

22:39.026 --> 22:40.928
Anyway...

22:40.994 --> 22:42.963
I'm glad I caught you.

22:43.030 --> 22:45.065
Yeah, yeah, me, too.

23:01.014 --> 23:02.082
(Elevator bell dings)

23:05.018 --> 23:07.020
Hey.

23:10.090 --> 23:11.959
What's this?

23:12.025 --> 23:12.993
My recommendation

23:13.060 --> 23:16.997
for the new vice chair
of Darling enterprises.

23:24.037 --> 23:25.939
Really?

23:26.006 --> 23:29.009
In terms of loyalty
and commitment and brains,

23:29.076 --> 23:31.011
that's the person

23:31.078 --> 23:33.013
best equipped to guide
the company, I feel.

23:33.080 --> 23:34.982
All right, then.

23:35.048 --> 23:38.051
The future
of Darling enterprises

23:38.118 --> 23:41.021
has just been secured.

23:54.034 --> 23:58.038
She was no ordinary woman,
my Ellen.

23:58.105 --> 23:59.973
No.

24:00.040 --> 24:01.975
Far from it.

24:02.042 --> 24:05.012
Ellen's special blend
of courage and kindness

24:05.078 --> 24:07.014
combined to form a whole
that embodied--

24:07.080 --> 24:10.951
what a body it was--

24:11.018 --> 24:12.953
the American spirit,

24:13.020 --> 24:15.956
that uniquely American spirit
that celebrated freedom,

24:16.023 --> 24:17.057
creativity

24:17.124 --> 24:19.059
and transformation.

24:19.126 --> 24:21.061
Does that sound like
Ellen to you?

24:21.128 --> 24:25.065
I think he's delirious
with grief.

24:29.036 --> 24:30.971
(Voice breaking) Sorry.

24:31.038 --> 24:32.940
Just...

24:33.006 --> 24:35.943
Not a moment goes by
that I don't miss her.

24:36.009 --> 24:37.044
(Normal voice)
But I know that even though

24:37.110 --> 24:39.046
her corporeal being has left us,

24:39.112 --> 24:44.051
her... spirit lives on
in my heart.

24:46.053 --> 24:47.988
You know, I was born

24:48.055 --> 24:51.024
with every advantage
a person could have.

24:53.093 --> 24:58.065
But Ellen made me feel like
I was worth something.

25:00.033 --> 25:03.070
I just miss her so much.

25:07.040 --> 25:08.976
(Camera shutters clicking)

25:09.042 --> 25:11.011
(Whispers) I love you.

25:14.014 --> 25:16.049
(Man) And now here
with a musical tribute,

25:16.116 --> 25:18.952
one of Ellen's
favorite performers--

25:19.019 --> 25:21.088
Mr. Kenny G.

25:28.095 --> 25:32.032
(Playing "amazing grace")

25:43.010 --> 25:44.945
(Siren wails)

25:45.012 --> 25:48.982
♪♪♪

25:49.049 --> 25:50.951
Uh-oh. Here we go.

25:51.018 --> 25:54.054
(Police radio chatter)

25:59.026 --> 26:01.061
Sorry to break up
the party.

26:01.128 --> 26:04.031
I've been expecting you.
You really gonna do this?

26:04.097 --> 26:06.033
You put her
in a difficult position

26:06.099 --> 26:08.035
by letting her attend, Nick.

26:08.101 --> 26:09.036
Go get her.

26:09.102 --> 26:11.038
(Man) Out of the way, please.

26:11.104 --> 26:13.040
(Camera shutters clicking)

26:13.106 --> 26:17.978
(Crowd murmuring)

26:18.045 --> 26:21.949
Gentlemen.
Mrs. Darling, we're gonna
have to ask you to come with us.

26:22.015 --> 26:24.952
She will do nothing
of the kind.
Sir, she's violated
house arrest.

26:25.018 --> 26:26.053
Mrs. Darling, please.

26:26.119 --> 26:28.021
(Man) Ma'am? Ma'am, please.

26:28.088 --> 26:30.991
Hey, get the hell
away from my mother.

26:31.058 --> 26:33.927
Sir, step away
or I will have you arrested.
No, you step away,

26:33.994 --> 26:35.996
or I'm gonna have you
working a crosswalk, chubby.

26:36.063 --> 26:38.932
You're not helping.

26:38.999 --> 26:42.035
(Man) That's them. I see her.
(Woman) Let's go! Let's go!

26:42.102 --> 26:45.005
(Reporters all shouting at once)
Well, counselor,
there they go.

26:45.072 --> 26:47.007
Six major news outlets
recording the brutal arrest

26:47.074 --> 26:49.042
of a grief-stricken woman.

26:49.109 --> 26:52.946
If you're looking to taint
the jury pool in her favor--
I don't think
that's how it plays.

26:53.013 --> 26:54.948
Enlighten me.
I see a cold-blooded murderer

26:55.015 --> 26:56.984
whose sense of entitlement
knows no bounds.
She's a grandmother.

26:57.050 --> 26:59.019
She's a sociopath.
Oh.

26:59.086 --> 27:01.021
No, no, Tish. Patrick!
Oh.

27:01.088 --> 27:03.023
Mom?
Get a doctor. Nick!

27:03.090 --> 27:05.926
We need a doctor!
Oh, great.

27:05.993 --> 27:07.961
Way to go, moron!
Sir, I am warning you,
step back.

27:08.028 --> 27:09.997
Or what?
You still sure
you want to do this?

27:10.063 --> 27:11.965
(Man) Somebody get a doctor!

27:12.032 --> 27:13.967
It is getting a little icky.

27:14.034 --> 27:15.969
I'll let her go
with a warning.

27:16.036 --> 27:18.939
I'll send you
the medical bills.

27:19.006 --> 27:19.973
Right.

27:20.040 --> 27:21.041
(Gasps)

27:21.108 --> 27:23.977
What the hell?
What do you think
you're doing?

27:24.044 --> 27:26.046
My job.
I need to see you tonight.

27:26.113 --> 27:29.983
Not possible.
Oh, how 'bout I go perform
a little duet with mister G.

27:30.050 --> 27:32.953
About how you slept
with the defendant's son

27:33.020 --> 27:35.956
hours before you arrested
his mother for murder?
You wouldn't.

27:36.023 --> 27:37.024
We paid for two songs.

27:37.090 --> 27:39.026
(Sighs) 10:00,
my apartment.

27:39.092 --> 27:43.997
But by 10:05,
you're out on your ass.

27:44.064 --> 27:45.999
Okay, let her go.
Take off the cuffs.

27:46.066 --> 27:48.969
(Officer) And who
the hell are you?
I'm the family lawyer.

27:49.036 --> 27:50.971
I just consulted
with your boss,

27:51.038 --> 27:54.041
and she said there's been
a misunderstanding.
Yeah, I guess you guys
are gonna have to

27:54.107 --> 27:56.043
go get your jollies
somewhere else.

27:56.109 --> 27:59.980
Maybe you can go roll
a few bums.
That does it. You are coming
down to the station with us.

28:00.047 --> 28:01.982
The hell I am!
Sir, I am serious.

28:02.049 --> 28:04.017
Why don't you bring it,
doughnut hole?
Oh, all right.

28:04.084 --> 28:07.020
Okay, Brian, just step back.
I will take care of this, okay?
Oh, the hell you will.

28:07.087 --> 28:09.022
Oh!
(Crowd murmuring)

28:09.089 --> 28:11.024
(Tripp) Get your hands
off my son!

28:11.091 --> 28:12.960
No, no!

28:13.026 --> 28:16.964
(All speaking indistinctly)

28:17.030 --> 28:19.032
(Cell door clanks)

28:26.039 --> 28:28.976
You know a good lawyer?

28:29.042 --> 28:31.945
Not in the mood, Brian.

28:32.012 --> 28:33.947
Hey, I just got arrested

28:34.014 --> 28:35.949
for assaulting
a peace officer.

28:36.016 --> 28:38.952
I'm gonna need counsel,
and I know how eager you are

28:39.019 --> 28:40.921
to defend a Darling
in open court.

28:40.988 --> 28:42.956
Anyway, it doesn't matter,

28:43.023 --> 28:45.926
'cause I get
your whole thing, Nick.
What are you talking about?

28:45.993 --> 28:47.060
The company.

28:47.127 --> 28:49.029
What about it?

28:49.096 --> 28:51.031
You want to run the company.

28:51.098 --> 28:53.033
(Scoffs) I don't want
to run the company.

28:53.100 --> 28:55.035
But you said so yourself.

28:55.102 --> 28:58.038
You grew up slinking around
the edge of a rich family

28:58.105 --> 29:00.974
wondering why you of all people
were so unlucky

29:01.041 --> 29:03.977
to be put
that close to the prize

29:04.044 --> 29:06.980
and denied it
every single day.
That's not what I said.

29:07.047 --> 29:08.982
And now here you are
years later.

29:09.049 --> 29:11.952
I mean, far be it from you
at this late date

29:12.019 --> 29:13.987
to pick a fight
with Tripp Darling,

29:14.054 --> 29:16.023
the one guy who could hand you
the whole kitty

29:16.089 --> 29:18.926
on a silver
monogrammed platter.
Damn it, Brian.
I picked you!

29:18.992 --> 29:19.993
Bull crap.
Ask Tripp.

29:20.060 --> 29:22.930
I handed him a memo yesterday
with my recommendation

29:22.996 --> 29:25.933
for a successor,
and it was you.
Why would you do that?

29:25.999 --> 29:28.001
Because, Brian, you're
the best person for the job.

29:28.068 --> 29:30.037
You've been the black sheep
in that family

29:30.103 --> 29:32.039
for your whole life,

29:32.105 --> 29:34.975
and you're still willing
to do anything for them,

29:35.042 --> 29:36.043
like sabotaging
court documents

29:36.109 --> 29:38.979
and getting people
like Terry deramian fired.
You found out about that?

29:39.046 --> 29:41.048
And because you're
a real pain in the ass,

29:41.114 --> 29:43.050
and when it's your job

29:43.116 --> 29:45.052
to run a $50-billion
global enterprise,

29:45.118 --> 29:47.054
that's not
such a bad thing to be.

29:47.120 --> 29:48.956
(Sighs)

29:49.022 --> 29:51.992
Just take the case.

29:52.059 --> 29:53.994
Brian, why are you
so intensely committed

29:54.061 --> 29:56.063
to getting me
to take this case?

29:56.129 --> 29:58.966
Because I know my mom
didn't do it.

29:59.032 --> 30:01.034
And if the only way
to get her off

30:01.101 --> 30:04.037
is for the son of the guy
she's accused of killing

30:04.104 --> 30:07.007
to stand up in court
and say she didn't do it?

30:07.074 --> 30:09.009
Then that's
what has to happen.

30:09.076 --> 30:11.979
She's innocent.

30:12.045 --> 30:14.047
And you used to be
the kind of person

30:14.114 --> 30:16.049
who cared
about stuff like that.

30:16.116 --> 30:17.985
Oh, Brian...

30:18.051 --> 30:22.022
Besides, we both know
who killed our dad.

30:22.089 --> 30:23.957
Who?

30:24.024 --> 30:26.960
Come on.
Who do you think?

30:27.027 --> 30:28.929
The woman he loved...

30:28.996 --> 30:32.065
Or the guy he betrayed
for the past 40 years?

30:35.035 --> 30:36.003
Tripp?

30:36.069 --> 30:38.038
Tripp.

30:38.105 --> 30:42.042
Not that we'll be able
to do anything about it.

30:42.109 --> 30:45.946
We all know how that works.

30:46.013 --> 30:47.948
(Buzzer sounds)

30:48.015 --> 30:49.049
(Door opens)

30:49.116 --> 30:51.952
Hello, ladies.

30:52.019 --> 30:53.954
Well...

30:54.021 --> 30:56.957
What happened?
The officers involved
in your little donnybrook

30:57.024 --> 30:58.058
don't want to testify.

30:58.125 --> 31:00.961
Something about
saving their pensions

31:01.028 --> 31:03.964
from the vengeful arm
of the Darlings.
(Scoffs) Sissies.

31:04.031 --> 31:07.034
Oh, God.
Just get 'em out of here.

31:07.100 --> 31:09.069
(Nola sighs)

31:14.007 --> 31:15.042
Tough luck, huh, counselor?

31:15.108 --> 31:18.946
I'm fine with it. You're not
the Darling I want anyway.

31:19.012 --> 31:21.048
I'm not a Darling.
Aren't you?

31:21.114 --> 31:23.016
Come on.

31:23.083 --> 31:27.054
You're the darlingest
Darling of them all.

31:40.033 --> 31:41.969
Oh, Mr. Darling.

31:42.035 --> 31:44.972
(Lowered voice) She's the one
who thinks you killed mommy.

31:45.038 --> 31:47.975
Mr. Darling.
What--what can I
do for you?

31:48.041 --> 31:49.009
I'm Connie dallamuir.

31:49.076 --> 31:51.011
I've heard a lot about you.

31:51.078 --> 31:53.947
I won't keep you.
I just wanted to say

31:54.014 --> 31:56.016
that I saw the eulogy
you delivered on the news.

31:56.083 --> 31:57.050
Yes?

31:57.117 --> 31:58.986
I just have to say

31:59.052 --> 32:00.954
it was lovely.

32:01.021 --> 32:02.990
It felt like
you were speaking

32:03.056 --> 32:04.992
straight from your heart
to mine,

32:05.058 --> 32:07.027
to anyone who's lost
a loved one.

32:07.094 --> 32:09.029
You'll make a great senator.

32:09.096 --> 32:11.031
Thank you.

32:11.098 --> 32:14.034
Thank you very much.

32:14.101 --> 32:17.104
Good afternoon.

32:22.042 --> 32:24.044
(Knock on door)

32:29.049 --> 32:30.984
You're four minutes late.

32:31.051 --> 32:33.987
I stopped to get these.
You've got 60 seconds.

32:34.054 --> 32:36.990
All right, then tell me
once and for all...

32:37.057 --> 32:39.960
Did you or did you not
set me up?

32:40.027 --> 32:41.028
I set myself up.

32:41.094 --> 32:44.064
Look...
I've never lost a case,

32:44.131 --> 32:46.033
and I rarely face
opposing lawyers

32:46.099 --> 32:48.035
who present
even the slightest challenge.

32:48.101 --> 32:50.971
So I've developed
this bad habit

32:51.038 --> 32:53.974
of getting involved
with people close to the case,

32:54.041 --> 32:56.009
you know, as a way
of keeping it interesting.

32:56.076 --> 32:58.979
That's all this was.
Good-bye.

32:59.046 --> 33:01.014
So what,
I'm, like, your handicap?

33:01.081 --> 33:04.017
Did you hear
the way I screamed

33:04.084 --> 33:06.954
when we did it
in your limo?

33:07.020 --> 33:09.056
Yeah.
You're not a handicap.

33:09.122 --> 33:12.993
Then let me come inside.
No. I can't risk
losing this case.

33:13.060 --> 33:15.963
So if you don't mind--
nola, will you
hold these a sec?

33:16.029 --> 33:17.965
I know you're trying
my mom for murder,

33:18.031 --> 33:20.033
but... (Whispers) God,
I want you so much.

33:20.100 --> 33:21.969
Jeremy, sex is just sex.

33:22.035 --> 33:23.971
(Normal voice)
This isn't about sex.

33:24.037 --> 33:25.973
This is about your face.

33:26.039 --> 33:28.976
You have the most beautiful face
in the world, nola...

33:29.042 --> 33:32.012
Your eyes, your lips

33:32.079 --> 33:34.948
your little, tiny freckles.

33:35.015 --> 33:36.950
You know
what I think about most

33:37.017 --> 33:38.952
when I remember that night
in the limo?

33:39.019 --> 33:39.987
Don't tell me.

33:40.053 --> 33:44.024
The feeling of your ear
against my upper lip...

33:44.091 --> 33:47.027
And the way the back of
your head felt in my hand

33:47.094 --> 33:49.997
as I held it when you...
You know.

33:50.063 --> 33:52.065
We both know
this can't happen.

33:52.132 --> 33:54.935
I don't.

33:55.002 --> 33:56.036
Let me in.

33:56.103 --> 33:59.072
My 60 seconds ran out
60 seconds ago.

34:01.108 --> 34:02.976
No one...

34:03.043 --> 34:08.014
(Whispers)
Will ever... find out.

34:19.092 --> 34:21.027

I, um...
I made my case for you

34:24.031 --> 34:25.998
as dispassionately
as I could.

34:26.065 --> 34:28.068
Nick listened.

34:28.135 --> 34:30.070
You know, but to be honest,

34:30.137 --> 34:32.039
I don't think
he was really interested

34:32.105 --> 34:34.041
in what I had to say.

34:34.107 --> 34:37.978
So after about an hour,
I-I wrapped it up

34:38.045 --> 34:40.947
and I thanked him
for his time.

34:41.014 --> 34:43.016
So he's not
going to pick me, is he?

34:43.083 --> 34:45.953
Honey, I don't know.

34:46.018 --> 34:47.020
I don't know.

34:47.087 --> 34:50.023
I just think
at the end of the day,

34:50.090 --> 34:53.060
he doesn't take you

CNBC's confirmed that

35:18.018 --> 35:20.988
the press conference
will air live.

35:21.054 --> 35:23.957
Good. That's good.

35:24.024 --> 35:27.995
I'll take the case.

35:28.061 --> 35:29.963
Excuse me?

35:30.030 --> 35:32.032
I'll defend Letitia.

35:32.099 --> 35:35.969
Well, that--that--that's--
that's wonderful news, Nick.

35:36.036 --> 35:37.971
May I ask you

35:38.038 --> 35:40.007
what caused you
to change your mind?

35:40.073 --> 35:44.011
Ah, we both know
she didn't do it.

35:44.077 --> 35:45.979
Okay.

35:46.046 --> 35:49.016
And besides, Tripp...

35:49.082 --> 35:50.984
We're family.

36:08.001 --> 36:10.003
Hey, you look good.

36:10.070 --> 36:12.940
I have an interview
at the Needham gallery.

36:13.006 --> 36:14.007
That's good.

36:14.074 --> 36:15.943
Oh, whatever.

36:16.009 --> 36:18.011
I'm overqualified
and I probably won't get it,

36:18.078 --> 36:20.013
but I'm not that psyched
for it anyway.

36:20.080 --> 36:23.016
So why go?
Well, I gotta do
something with my life.

36:23.083 --> 36:25.018
Kiki is in school all day,

36:25.085 --> 36:28.956
and since we're apparently
not having another baby...

36:29.022 --> 36:31.058
I took the case.

36:37.998 --> 36:39.032
Letitia's?

36:39.099 --> 36:40.968
Yeah.

36:41.034 --> 36:42.970
Why?

36:43.036 --> 36:45.038
Because she's innocent.

36:45.105 --> 36:47.941
Look, it's complicated.

36:48.008 --> 36:49.009
No, it's not.

36:49.076 --> 36:50.944
It's really simple.

36:51.011 --> 36:52.946
You can't say no
to the Darlings.

36:53.013 --> 36:56.016
Lisa, would you just
listen to me?

36:59.019 --> 37:01.054
I know what I'm doing.

37:01.121 --> 37:03.991
You used to have faith in me.

37:04.057 --> 37:06.994
Have some now. Please.

37:09.029 --> 37:09.997
Okay.

37:10.063 --> 37:13.066
I'll see you
at the press conference.

37:16.003 --> 37:18.939
(Door opens and closes)

37:19.006 --> 37:20.040
(Tripp) Congratulations.

37:20.107 --> 37:23.944
Nick's decided to take
your mother's case,

37:24.011 --> 37:25.946
and it's thanks to you.

37:26.013 --> 37:27.948
Well, I made
a compelling argument,

37:28.015 --> 37:29.950
and Nick finally saw
the wisdom.

37:30.017 --> 37:33.020
It's very impressive,
son, very.

37:35.088 --> 37:38.992
There are great things
ahead for you.

37:39.059 --> 37:41.962
Don't doubt it.

37:42.029 --> 37:43.030
Come on.

37:43.096 --> 37:46.033
They're waiting downstairs.

37:50.037 --> 37:52.005
In light of
all the recent challenges

37:52.072 --> 37:55.976
that have befallen our family
and our company,

37:56.043 --> 37:59.980
it became incumbent upon me
to choose a successor

38:00.047 --> 38:01.982
who will take over from Letitia

38:02.049 --> 38:05.953
the position of vice chair
of Darling enterprises.

38:06.019 --> 38:10.991
It has not been an easy task.

38:11.058 --> 38:14.928
All the candidates
are extraordinarily talented,

38:14.995 --> 38:18.999
and I love
each and every one of them

38:19.066 --> 38:21.935
with all my heart.

38:22.002 --> 38:24.037
But the board demanded a leader,

38:24.104 --> 38:27.040
a decision maker
who would Usher in

38:27.107 --> 38:31.011
a great and prosperous new era
for us all.

38:31.078 --> 38:33.947
That was their mandate,
and suffice to say,

38:34.014 --> 38:35.949
we are, as of this moment,

38:36.016 --> 38:39.987
uh, uniformly thrilled
with our pick.

38:40.053 --> 38:42.956
So, ladies and gentlemen,
it gives me great pleasure

38:43.023 --> 38:44.958
to introduce to you

38:45.025 --> 38:47.060
the new vice chair
of Darling enterprises--

38:47.127 --> 38:48.996
Nick George.

38:49.062 --> 38:51.098
(Murmurs and applause)

38:57.037 --> 39:00.107
(Camera shutters clicking)

39:08.015 --> 39:10.017
(Cell phone buzzes)

39:10.083 --> 39:10.984
(Buzz)

39:11.051 --> 39:13.053
(Beep)

39:16.123 --> 39:18.959
(Woman) Congratulations.

39:19.026 --> 39:21.962
You're the guy, Nick.
You can do it. I know it.

39:22.029 --> 39:22.996
Good luck.

39:23.063 --> 39:25.999
(Applause)

39:26.066 --> 39:30.070
(Camera shutters clicking)

39:35.042 --> 39:38.045
(Indistinct conversations)

39:45.052 --> 39:47.020
Did you know daddy
was gonna pick Nick?

39:47.087 --> 39:49.990
No, I thought
he was gonna pick me.

39:50.057 --> 39:52.960
(Laughs) Oh.

39:53.026 --> 39:55.963
That was never
gonna happen.

39:56.029 --> 39:59.933
Oh, Lisa must be
so happy.

40:00.000 --> 40:03.036
Yeah, Tripp spreads joy
wherever he goes.

40:03.103 --> 40:05.038
Well, thank you.
Thank you very much.

40:05.105 --> 40:09.977
Thank you.
Uh, if you'll excuse me.

40:10.043 --> 40:11.044
Hi.

40:11.111 --> 40:13.046
Hi.

40:13.113 --> 40:15.949
God, you look beautiful.

40:16.016 --> 40:17.017
Thank you.

40:17.084 --> 40:20.020
I've been trying to make
my way across the room

40:20.087 --> 40:23.023
for the last half-hour.
Well, you're
very popular tonight.

40:23.090 --> 40:25.025
Yeah.

40:26.093 --> 40:27.995
Lisa, I didn't know.

40:28.061 --> 40:30.998
Look, this was
as much of a shock to me

40:31.064 --> 40:33.000
as it was to you.

40:33.066 --> 40:36.003
Do you think it's because
you took the case?

40:36.069 --> 40:38.005
You know,
I have no idea.

40:38.071 --> 40:40.941
We're supposed to sit down
and talk about it,

40:41.008 --> 40:45.045
but we haven't had a chance
with all the--
yeah.

40:47.047 --> 40:48.982
Is...

40:49.049 --> 40:51.051
This what you want?

40:51.118 --> 40:54.955
You know, I can't say I've
thought about it until now,

40:55.022 --> 40:56.056
but...

40:56.123 --> 40:58.959
It's not so bad,
you know?

40:59.026 --> 41:01.962
No, it's not so bad.

41:02.029 --> 41:02.963
Hey.

41:03.030 --> 41:03.997
What?

41:04.064 --> 41:06.033
Maybe I was wrong.
About?

41:06.099 --> 41:07.968
Having a baby.

41:08.035 --> 41:10.037
Look, maybe you were right.
Maybe we should do it.

41:10.103 --> 41:13.974
We are in
a really good place right now.

41:14.041 --> 41:15.042
No.

41:15.108 --> 41:17.044
No? Why not?

41:17.110 --> 41:19.980
Because.

41:20.047 --> 41:22.049
(Chuckles) You said
you wanted a baby.

41:22.115 --> 41:25.953
I just don't think
it's a good idea anymore.

41:26.019 --> 41:28.021
I'm sorry.

41:28.088 --> 41:30.958
Nick? Can I steal you away
for second?

41:31.024 --> 41:33.994
Somebody I want you
to meet.
I-I will be right there.

41:34.061 --> 41:35.963
Go, Nick.

41:36.029 --> 41:38.999
Look, I want to continue
this conversation.

41:39.066 --> 41:41.969
Go. I'm not going anywhere.
Go.

41:42.035 --> 41:45.038
An old friend of mine.
I haven't seen him for years.

41:45.105 --> 41:48.041
I've been telling him
all about you.

41:48.108 --> 41:50.010
This is Nick.
(Man) Nick.

41:50.787 --> 41:51.771
(Door closes)
