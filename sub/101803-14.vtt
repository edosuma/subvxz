it just doesn't go away.

00:09.618 --> 00:11.924
If you really want
to protect your brothers,

00:11.968 --> 00:15.015
you can't just be their sheepdog
when you're downrange.

00:15.058 --> 00:17.278
The wounds you can't see
are the hardest to deal with,

00:17.321 --> 00:18.757
as I'm sure your wife knows.

00:18.801 --> 00:20.194
No, but, what are
you trying to say?

00:20.237 --> 00:21.891
Lady, you don't know
anything about me.

00:21.934 --> 00:23.719
-What happened with that doctor?
-I left things a bit of a mess

00:23.762 --> 00:24.937
back home with Naima.

00:24.981 --> 00:26.678
It's not on you to fix
this problem for me.

00:26.722 --> 00:29.464
<i>The way you reacted to him--
I'm just wondering</i>

00:29.507 --> 00:32.336
if he's doing
to you what he did to me.

00:32.380 --> 00:34.121
Nothing to report, Lieutenant.

00:34.164 --> 00:35.687
You've been making people
uncomfortable.

00:35.731 --> 00:36.906
You don't treat anyone
on this ship the way

00:36.949 --> 00:39.039
-that you treated me.
-Message received.

00:39.082 --> 00:40.823
I just learned you dropped
the ball as Bravo rep

00:40.866 --> 00:42.651
at yesterday's general
quarters meeting.

00:42.694 --> 00:45.480
Maybe you just chose
the wrong guy to be secretary.

00:45.523 --> 00:47.438
I got an email
from Hannah that she was having

00:47.482 --> 00:49.005
some sort of complications.

00:49.049 --> 00:51.486
Yeah. You're drinking?

00:51.529 --> 00:53.488
But you got to evolve.

00:53.531 --> 00:54.880
Better choices.

01:13.203 --> 01:14.378
-Hayes.
-Yeah?

01:14.422 --> 01:15.814
-Where's the team?
-The high bay.

01:15.858 --> 01:17.425
Probably at each other's
throats by now.

01:17.468 --> 01:19.122
Fight club, that's right.

01:20.776 --> 01:22.038
Take a seat, little man.

01:25.737 --> 01:27.652
Come on, man!

01:27.696 --> 01:28.653
Who's up?

01:28.697 --> 01:29.872
Want me to go gather them up?

01:29.915 --> 01:31.656
Wanted to talk to you, actually.

01:31.700 --> 01:34.355
Bravo's mission failure last op
isn't sitting right with me.

01:34.398 --> 01:36.966
Feel we may be steering
-this ship to different ports.
-Know what?

01:37.009 --> 01:38.881
We're steering in the right
direction. My team's good to go.

♪ Yeah, you know we got you...

01:55.985 --> 01:58.030
Can't deny his behavior
a few weeks ago was pathetic,

01:58.074 --> 02:00.076
botching his
general quarters duty.

02:00.120 --> 02:01.643
Look, I got his
head back straight.

02:01.686 --> 02:03.645
Probably didn't help that
you gave his job to Clay.

02:03.688 --> 02:06.648
Spenser's reliable. How
about Warrant Officer Perry?

02:06.691 --> 02:08.215
<i>I'd hoped he'd be more
of an asset this deployment,</i>

02:08.258 --> 02:10.130
<i>but he's seemed distracted.</i>

02:20.879 --> 02:22.794
Ray's dealing with
some home front stuff,

02:22.838 --> 02:24.013
but I'm telling
you, I'm on it.

02:24.056 --> 02:25.580
All right, man?
Bravo is good.

02:25.623 --> 02:26.929
Look at these boys, huh?

02:26.972 --> 02:28.148
We ever get off this
ship, you'll be able

02:28.191 --> 02:29.497
to come check it out.

02:29.540 --> 02:31.194
May get the opportunity
sooner than you think.

02:31.238 --> 02:33.327
-Got an op coming down the pike.
-Well,

02:33.370 --> 02:36.112
must be big with you
playing 20 questions.

02:36.156 --> 02:38.114
Could be a game-changer.

02:38.158 --> 02:39.246
Good, 'cause we didn't
come all this way

02:39.289 --> 02:40.595
just to fight each
other, did we?

02:40.638 --> 02:42.205
Come on! Let's go.

02:45.252 --> 02:46.557
Hold it...

02:46.601 --> 02:48.516
All right, simmer down,
now, okay?

02:48.559 --> 02:50.170
All right, hey, hey... Break it up!

03:02.269 --> 03:03.705
No Jace?

03:03.748 --> 03:05.228
Op falls under S.A.

03:05.272 --> 03:07.187
Cell phone pulled from our
deceased Boko Haram lieutenant

03:07.230 --> 03:09.624
has proven more valuable
than the Agency imagined.

03:09.667 --> 03:12.061
Among the trove
of intel was this.

03:12.104 --> 03:14.585
A previously unknown Boko camp

03:14.629 --> 03:16.544
30 klicks outside
of Kano, Nigeria.

03:16.587 --> 03:19.199
Up to 60 Boko fighters
living there.

03:19.242 --> 03:20.635
Serious hornet's nest.

03:20.678 --> 03:24.204
But that's not
what caught the CIA's eye.

03:24.247 --> 03:28.773
-A/
-C units, used to cool the
computer servers housed within.

03:28.817 --> 03:31.472
Intel indicates
that this camp is a hub

03:31.515 --> 03:33.952
for Boko Haram's data channels.

03:33.996 --> 03:35.345
Uh, the same dirtbags that
are killing people with machetes

03:35.389 --> 03:36.694
are tech'd up like this?

03:36.738 --> 03:38.653
Boko's evolving,
just like we've seen

03:38.696 --> 03:40.394
with I.S. and A.Q. previously.

03:40.437 --> 03:43.266
Boko is a 20,000-person
terrorist business.

03:43.310 --> 03:46.008
Hacking into their network could
lay bare their whole structure.

03:46.051 --> 03:48.663
Finances, personnel, targets.

03:48.706 --> 03:51.143
The CIA is tasking Bravo

03:51.187 --> 03:52.971
with infiltrating
to plant a device

03:53.015 --> 03:55.496
that would allow them to tap
all data passing through.

03:55.539 --> 03:57.019
Got a solid plan for infil.

03:57.062 --> 03:59.369
Now, the camp receives
a regular water delivery.

03:59.413 --> 04:01.589
CIA's outfitting
a look-alike tanker truck.

04:01.632 --> 04:02.807
-Trojan Horse?
-Mm-hmm.

04:02.851 --> 04:04.113
Downside,

04:04.156 --> 04:06.071
those water deliveries
happen during the day,

04:06.115 --> 04:08.596
forcing you to execute
without the cover of night.

04:08.639 --> 04:10.380
We will be
lifestyle-patterning the camp

04:10.424 --> 04:11.642
for the next week
with IMAGINT,

04:11.686 --> 04:13.644
getting all the
details bolted down.

04:13.688 --> 04:17.300
Meantime, Bravo will flesh out
the target package.

04:17.344 --> 04:19.781
Warrant Officer Perry,
you'll read the team in.

04:19.824 --> 04:21.826
Roger that.

04:21.870 --> 04:23.785
Crammed into airless metal boxes

04:23.828 --> 04:26.309
seems to be the theme
of this deployment, huh?

04:26.353 --> 04:28.398
It's the action
we've all been craving.

04:28.442 --> 04:30.313
Take the <i>Hindenburg
if it gets us there.</i>

04:30.357 --> 04:32.315
That was a good one,
Andrew Dice Clay,

04:32.359 --> 04:36.450
but why don't you shut up
and start prepping?

04:36.493 --> 04:39.801
All right, let's see.
Det cord's already cut,

04:39.844 --> 04:41.977
labeled, double-checked.

04:42.020 --> 04:45.023
And I have ID'd all the
target breaching points, too.

04:46.895 --> 04:48.288
You're on top of it.

04:48.331 --> 04:50.290
Like butter on bacon.

04:50.333 --> 04:53.336
Now, where is Jace?

04:53.380 --> 04:55.860
You want the teacher
to give you a sticker?

04:55.904 --> 04:57.035
The hell's going on here?

04:57.079 --> 04:58.167
Uh, he might've caught me

04:58.210 --> 04:59.690
a little Cooter Brown
the other night,

04:59.734 --> 05:04.652
sipping on, uh,
Bravo's private stash.

05:04.695 --> 05:06.393
I knew it was a mistake

05:06.436 --> 05:08.177
bringing that booze
on board, man.

05:08.220 --> 05:09.918
If we get caught with that stuff
on the ship...

05:09.961 --> 05:12.007
Easy there, blonde-noser, okay?

05:12.050 --> 05:13.530
Bravo 1 is the only person
that knows,

05:13.574 --> 05:16.054
and he's already
given me what-for.

05:16.098 --> 05:17.969
You were drinking alone?

05:19.971 --> 05:21.582
Look, Sonny,

05:21.625 --> 05:24.367
I know that you're
stressed out about being a dad,

05:24.411 --> 05:25.934
but if you're gonna make it
through this deployment...

05:25.977 --> 05:27.631
I've already got one sheepdog

05:27.675 --> 05:29.677
breathing down my neck,
thank you.

05:29.720 --> 05:31.809
You need a swim buddy.

05:31.853 --> 05:34.029
Keep you sane
and out of trouble.

05:34.072 --> 05:35.770
All right, you and me--

05:35.813 --> 05:38.033
we'll work out together,
we'll eat together,

05:38.076 --> 05:39.600
I check in with Stella,
you check in with Hannah.

05:39.643 --> 05:41.602
I feel like this is working up
to some weird

05:41.645 --> 05:44.126
tandem bathroom thing.

05:44.169 --> 05:46.171
Man... I'm serious, man.

05:47.956 --> 05:51.220
I'll have your back and
I'll make sure Jason's off it.

05:51.263 --> 05:55.137
All right. Show me the way,
there, L. Blonde Hubbard.

05:59.576 --> 06:01.186
Everything okay?

06:01.230 --> 06:03.058
Might be if I didn't have
to keep getting a damn token

06:03.101 --> 06:04.973
to reset my SIPRNet password.

06:05.016 --> 06:06.366
That's weird.
I haven't heard of anybody else

06:06.409 --> 06:08.846
having to do that.

06:08.890 --> 06:10.457
Where do you have
to get it from?

06:10.500 --> 06:13.982
Commander Whitshaw's department.
Been happening all week.

06:15.462 --> 06:17.072
He's retaliating.

06:17.115 --> 06:18.203
For what?

06:19.683 --> 06:21.076
I confronted him.

06:21.119 --> 06:22.425
The way he was
harassing you, I...

06:22.469 --> 06:24.035
Wh... I told you I didn't
want to get into that.

06:24.079 --> 06:25.602
I didn't
mention your name.

06:25.646 --> 06:26.995
I tried not to make it
about you.

06:27.038 --> 06:28.692
Well, now it is.

06:34.742 --> 06:37.919
Retaliation is more harassment.

06:37.962 --> 06:40.269
-You need to report him.
-No.

06:40.312 --> 06:43.054
-I'll help.
-No. You've done enough.

06:49.321 --> 06:52.934
Mina, reporting is the only way

06:52.977 --> 06:56.241
this becomes his problem,
not yours.

07:00.855 --> 07:02.160
<i>Is there anything else</i>

07:02.204 --> 07:04.075
you'd like to add to the report?

07:04.119 --> 07:07.688
No.
I think that's everything.

07:07.731 --> 07:09.951
I'd like to add something.
When I first learned

07:09.994 --> 07:12.649
about the harassment,
I made a mistake.

07:12.693 --> 07:14.869
I confronted Lieutenant
Commander Whitshaw about

07:14.912 --> 07:16.653
the behavior to try
to correct it informally.

07:16.697 --> 07:19.134
Considering the circumstance,

07:19.177 --> 07:22.224
I don't see
much of a mistake in that.

07:22.267 --> 07:23.878
The mistake was thinking
that he could be reasoned with.

07:23.921 --> 07:25.532
Instead of putting his victim

07:25.575 --> 07:26.968
through more disruption.

07:27.011 --> 07:28.709
You deserve to be
treated fairly.

07:28.752 --> 07:30.885
We will address
the SIPRNet problem,

07:30.928 --> 07:32.495
which seems to be retaliation.

07:32.539 --> 07:34.802
And we'll make sure the command
issues a no-contact order

07:34.845 --> 07:36.586
against Lieutenant
Commander Whitshaw

07:36.630 --> 07:38.762
for the duration of
the investigation.

07:38.806 --> 07:40.372
Great.

07:42.331 --> 07:44.202
There's nothing in there.

07:44.246 --> 07:45.987
No? You like... No. Nope.

07:47.989 --> 07:49.425
Oh, you boys
are at it early.

07:49.469 --> 07:51.209
We already hit the gym, too.

07:51.253 --> 07:54.648
Bench-press up-shorts view
ain't any prettier at 0500.

07:54.691 --> 07:55.866
-All right, well, I'll
tell you what, man,

07:55.910 --> 07:56.954
Let's dial in this op.

07:56.998 --> 07:57.955
We don't want to be
sitting ducks

07:57.999 --> 07:59.130
with Boko, that's for sure.

07:59.174 --> 08:02.177
The only thing
I'm afraid of is me.

08:04.005 --> 08:06.398
-All right. Okay,
Jeffrey Dahmer.

08:06.442 --> 08:09.227
Okay.

08:10.272 --> 08:11.926
Okay, uh, guard's choke point's

08:11.969 --> 08:13.101
here.

08:14.363 --> 08:16.800
This here gives us cover.

08:24.591 --> 08:26.070
Securing this area
covers exfil.

08:34.252 --> 08:36.080
I must admit, Master Chief,

08:36.124 --> 08:38.213
Bravo's delivered an airtight
mission plan.

08:38.256 --> 08:40.563
Glad you weren't overpromising
on their readiness.

08:40.607 --> 08:42.260
Told you, the team's good to go.

08:42.304 --> 08:44.001
Only thing missing
is the green light.

08:44.045 --> 08:46.047
-Yep.
-The next day or two.

08:47.135 --> 08:48.919
Hey, that promise--
it still stands.

08:48.963 --> 08:51.313
You know, you want to suit up
with us on game day,

08:51.356 --> 08:53.620
you're more
-than welcome to.
-All right.

08:55.796 --> 08:58.494
Jason Hayes extending
an olive branch?

08:58.538 --> 09:00.583
Lack of oxygen down here
must be getting to you.

09:00.627 --> 09:02.193
Yeah, I'm just, you know, happy

09:02.237 --> 09:03.804
that Bravo's firing
on all cylinders, right?

09:03.847 --> 09:04.805
Like you?

09:04.848 --> 09:07.329
Oh, yeah.
Matter of fact,

09:07.372 --> 09:09.592
I'm heading up to write
a letter to Naima right now.

09:09.636 --> 09:11.594
What, no FaceTime?

09:11.638 --> 09:14.162
Uh, writing it down helps me
get my thoughts straight.

09:14.205 --> 09:15.816
-Find the right words.
-Yeah.

09:15.859 --> 09:17.600
-Hmm.
-You volunteering to be
a human thesaurus?

09:17.644 --> 09:19.820
Yeah, I didn't think so.

09:30.265 --> 09:32.484
Hey, I, uh...

09:32.528 --> 09:34.182
I thought that Ray
squared things away with Naima

09:34.225 --> 09:35.400
before we left.

09:35.444 --> 09:37.185
Yeah, you got
some bad intel there.

09:37.228 --> 09:39.013
I'll make sure that, uh,
Ray's on it.

09:39.056 --> 09:41.145
There's no problem that can't
be worked, right?

09:41.189 --> 09:43.147
-Yeah.
-Mm-hmm.

09:46.107 --> 09:48.675
Wait, wait, so...

09:48.718 --> 09:50.415
pest control
still hasn't been out?

09:52.069 --> 09:54.245
Well, t-the landlord swore
that it would happen today.

09:56.378 --> 09:58.423
Stella.
No, I-I get it,

09:58.467 --> 10:00.730
You don't...
Don't overreact.

10:00.774 --> 10:03.646
You don't-you don't
need to move out.

10:03.690 --> 10:05.387
-No, babe.
Whoa!

10:05.430 --> 10:08.477
Hang on. I-I got to go.

10:08.520 --> 10:10.653
Definitely not my...

10:10.697 --> 10:12.394
-Sonny. Hey, you all right?
-Where did my pillow...

10:12.437 --> 10:14.483
-You all right?
-That's gonna leave a mark.
Yeah. Yeah.

10:14.526 --> 10:15.658
Hey, Clay.

10:15.702 --> 10:18.052
Clay Spenser.

10:18.095 --> 10:20.315
Hey, Full Metal.
What up?

10:21.969 --> 10:23.318
Wh... Oh.

10:23.361 --> 10:25.233
I think I just sprung a leak.

10:25.276 --> 10:26.887
Does this look like
bourbon to you?

10:26.930 --> 10:28.715
-Metal, help him up.
-Hey, keep it down.

10:28.758 --> 10:30.673
People are sleeping.

10:30.717 --> 10:31.848
-All right.
-Move.

10:31.892 --> 10:33.371
Hook up...
There... Ooh.

10:33.415 --> 10:34.895
I swear I haven't been drinking.

10:34.938 --> 10:36.548
Somebody spiked the punch.

10:45.470 --> 10:48.952
All right, where we going?
Hey!

10:48.996 --> 10:50.693
-Hey, get out.
-What are you d...
what you doing?

10:50.737 --> 10:51.955
We need the room,
let's go.

10:51.999 --> 10:53.783
-Frogmen only.
-Yes, sir.

10:53.827 --> 10:56.960
Kid's a regular Steven Seagal
protecting us from the siege.

10:57.004 --> 10:58.788
-Hey, shut up.
-What?

10:58.832 --> 11:00.703
Yeah. Shh. Jason or Soto
hear us, we're screwed.

11:00.747 --> 11:03.097
-You understand? Shut up.
-Excuse me, guys,
keep it quiet.

11:03.140 --> 11:05.490
Shut... He's gonna need stitches.

11:05.534 --> 11:07.362
Smells like he's good
on anesthesia.

11:07.405 --> 11:10.017
Yeah.
Just lucky that Jace
wasn't in the berthing.

11:12.410 --> 11:13.498
Brock, go make sure the blood's
cleaned up, all right?

11:13.542 --> 11:14.935
-Roger.
-Thanks.

11:14.978 --> 11:17.372
Make it quick.
Chop, chop, Brock.

11:19.200 --> 11:21.332
Whole stash is gone.

11:21.376 --> 11:22.986
-Who did that?
-Did you drink this
all tonight

11:23.030 --> 11:24.945
Or you been lying
-to me all week? Huh?
-Oh...

11:24.988 --> 11:26.598
Um...

11:26.642 --> 11:28.339
What's it matter
anyway, seriously?

11:28.383 --> 11:30.646
Other than letting
down the life coach

11:30.690 --> 11:32.735
I didn't really ask for
in the first place. Ow!

11:32.779 --> 11:34.606
-Don't move.
You weren't
just gaslighting me.

11:34.650 --> 11:36.304
What about Jason, huh?

11:36.347 --> 11:38.088
All stations, the ship has moved

11:38.132 --> 11:40.003
into ThreatCon Yoke.

11:40.047 --> 11:41.744
Set all departments
to Condition Yoke.

11:41.788 --> 11:42.963
Is that a drill?

11:43.006 --> 11:44.878
Whoa.

11:44.921 --> 11:47.489
Uh, either way, half the ship's
gonna be up and about.

11:47.532 --> 11:49.796
Dance party.

11:49.839 --> 11:52.320
-Hey. Hey. Look at me.
-Yeah. Hey.

11:52.363 --> 11:53.495
Soon as you're sewn up,
we're slipping back

11:53.538 --> 11:55.149
Yeah?into the racks, silent,

11:55.192 --> 11:56.933
and you're showing up tomorrow
squared away, you got it?

11:56.977 --> 11:58.543
-You got it? Yeah.
-Shh.

12:10.904 --> 12:14.472
As you all heard last night, the
ship is now in ThreatCon Yoke.

12:14.516 --> 12:16.866
All personal and non-essential
comms have been shut down.

12:16.910 --> 12:18.389
We can't call home?

12:18.433 --> 12:20.043
For how long?

12:20.087 --> 12:21.828
Until the submarine that was
detected bearing our direction

12:21.871 --> 12:24.004
is determined
not to be a threat.

12:24.047 --> 12:25.788
What's that do to our op?

12:25.832 --> 12:28.051
Current ThreatCon doesn't impact
it. We'll proceed as planned.

12:28.095 --> 12:29.879
Great. Okay, Sonny and Trent,
you're going to shore

12:29.923 --> 12:32.577
to check on the infil vehicle.

12:32.621 --> 12:34.492
Let's make that
Ray and Trent.

12:39.062 --> 12:40.847
Oh, I'm happy to stay put.

12:40.890 --> 12:43.806
Fine. Everyone, let's,
uh, check on our gear.

12:43.850 --> 12:46.069
And, uh, we get the go-ahead
any moment now, got it?

12:59.256 --> 13:01.868
Hey! why's Sonny
still in your doghouse?

13:01.911 --> 13:03.826
Really claiming
you didn't know?

13:03.870 --> 13:05.480
Know what?

13:05.523 --> 13:07.177
A master-at-arms
reported an incident

13:07.221 --> 13:08.831
in the gear room
last night.

13:08.875 --> 13:11.268
Five members of Bravo
stumbled in at 0200.

13:11.312 --> 13:13.401
One bleeding and reeking
of booze-- "the good 'ol boy."

13:13.444 --> 13:14.968
All right, look, man, I thought
I set Sonny straight.

13:15.011 --> 13:16.360
Well, you thought wrong.

13:16.404 --> 13:18.536
I closed the loop with the
M.A., so Bravo hopefully

13:18.580 --> 13:20.582
won't be tossed from the ship.

13:20.625 --> 13:22.410
You still certain Bravo will
crush any op comes their way?

13:22.453 --> 13:24.542
All right, look, whatever
happened last night, you know,

13:24.586 --> 13:27.023
my men are still sharp
outside the wire.

13:27.067 --> 13:28.677
Glad I'll get
to judge for myself.

13:28.720 --> 13:30.722
I'll leave you
to deal with the guys.

14:07.498 --> 14:09.544
You see our contact?

14:09.587 --> 14:12.155
No. Might be out back.

14:13.200 --> 14:15.376
Yo. You mind?

14:15.419 --> 14:17.421
Yeah, go ahead.

14:59.202 --> 15:02.075
Okay... okay.

15:06.209 --> 15:08.211
Okay.

15:14.826 --> 15:16.828
Okay, all right...

15:35.891 --> 15:37.327
Everything okay?

15:37.371 --> 15:39.112
Yeah, yeah.

15:39.155 --> 15:41.897
The, uh... hatch sticks.

15:41.941 --> 15:44.595
Make sure it's fixed before
we roll out, all right?

15:53.778 --> 15:55.780
Ray, how'd it go?

15:55.824 --> 15:57.521
Water truck solid?

15:57.565 --> 16:00.046
Uh, it will be.

16:01.090 --> 16:02.874
What's eating at you?

16:02.918 --> 16:04.572
What, all of a sudden
you're just, uh,

16:04.615 --> 16:06.008
tapped into everyone
around here?

16:06.052 --> 16:07.270
What's that supposed to mean?

16:07.314 --> 16:09.229
Look, Sonny got hurt
and plastered last night.

16:09.272 --> 16:11.579
-I had to hear that from Soto.
-Uh, well,

16:11.622 --> 16:14.669
if you're asking if I knew
about it, I-I had no clue, man.

16:14.712 --> 16:16.149
Of course.
You haven't been clued-in

16:16.192 --> 16:17.846
since you've been
on board here.

16:17.889 --> 16:19.935
Jace, I told you this new job
has got me pulled in different

16:19.979 --> 16:21.328
directions than
deployments past.

16:21.371 --> 16:22.982
Besides, I thought you were
the Bravo whisperer now.

16:23.025 --> 16:25.158
Fixing everyone's issues.

16:25.201 --> 16:26.811
It's Davis.

16:26.855 --> 16:28.552
-Go time?
-Well, let's hope so.

16:28.596 --> 16:30.685
I got to get off this ship.

16:30.728 --> 16:32.861
The latest IMAGINT on
the Boko camp revealed

16:32.904 --> 16:34.732
a new element on target.

16:34.776 --> 16:37.648
Prisoner.
We know kidnap and ransom

16:37.692 --> 16:39.041
is Boko's bread and butter.

16:39.085 --> 16:41.696
FRS was able to ID him.
James Parker.

16:41.739 --> 16:44.046
Medical aid worker
who was abducted five years ago.

16:44.090 --> 16:47.093
-American.
-Okay, so now we're taking on
a hostage rescue as well.

16:47.136 --> 16:49.965
Well, Agency has made clear that
placing the spyware device

16:50.009 --> 16:51.923
remains the sole
mission objective.

16:51.967 --> 16:53.751
But we would be remiss
to not let you know

16:53.795 --> 16:55.231
of all presence on target.

16:55.275 --> 16:56.885
-Understood.
Guy's been there

16:56.928 --> 16:58.626
for five years, we're supposed
to pretend like he's not?

16:58.669 --> 17:00.323
There's no reason
we can't get him.

17:00.367 --> 17:02.021
Building where hotel's
being held is on

17:02.064 --> 17:03.935
the opposite side of the camp
from the servers.

17:03.979 --> 17:06.329
Water delivery cover only
gives us 20 mikes on target,

17:06.373 --> 17:08.462
-Can't hit both spots.
-We'll split the team, all right?

17:08.505 --> 17:11.813
Half take the server room,
the other half hits our hotel.

17:11.856 --> 17:14.120
Full light of day,
unproven infil platform,

17:14.163 --> 17:16.078
60 enemy on target?

17:16.122 --> 17:17.993
Odds are already teetering,
you want to stack more?

17:18.037 --> 17:19.255
One other factor in the mix.

17:19.299 --> 17:21.214
15 minutes ago,
ISR shows

17:21.257 --> 17:22.998
approximately half the fighters

17:23.042 --> 17:25.914
departing camp. Typically,
patterning shows those

17:25.957 --> 17:27.742
war parties gone
12 to 24 hours.

17:27.785 --> 17:29.961
They split the enemy in half.
We got to move right now.

17:37.882 --> 17:41.147
-You gonna help?
-About time, uh, we
hit dry land, Jace.

17:41.190 --> 17:43.845
These boots almost forgot
what doors taste like.

17:43.888 --> 17:45.107
-You loaded Soto's kit?
-Check.

17:45.151 --> 17:46.978
-Ray's kit?
-Check.

17:47.022 --> 17:48.980
-Subsonic rounds?
-Check and check.

17:49.024 --> 17:51.244
-Packed and ready to play.
-All right, look, you know what?

17:51.287 --> 17:52.462
A lot of moving parts
in this op.

17:52.506 --> 17:53.594
I need both your heads
dialed in, you got it?

17:53.637 --> 17:55.074
Roger that.

17:58.294 --> 18:00.122
-He knows.
-What?

18:00.166 --> 18:01.819
About last night.

18:01.863 --> 18:04.692
We got-we got to clear the air.
We got to come clean.

18:04.735 --> 18:06.433
No, you're just being paranoid,
man. Jason just tapped us

18:06.476 --> 18:08.565
as his wingmen on his
hostage rescue team.

18:08.609 --> 18:10.741
Yeah, so he can
keep an eye on us.

18:10.785 --> 18:14.441
Look, we can't have this hanging
over us before we roll out.

18:14.484 --> 18:16.051
Well, that'll clear the air
like one of Pepper's

18:16.095 --> 18:17.661
silent-but-deadlies, okay?

18:17.705 --> 18:19.837
Jason don't know and that's
the way he likes it.

18:19.881 --> 18:22.884
Now focus up, bruh.

18:22.927 --> 18:24.929
Here you go.

18:38.465 --> 18:40.467
Boko's run off all
the locals out here.

18:46.081 --> 18:48.214
Bravo, passing phase-line blue.

18:48.257 --> 18:50.955
Bravo copies phase-line blue.

18:53.436 --> 18:55.221
Ten klicks out.

18:55.264 --> 18:57.875
Hey. Let's go.
Wake up. Remember,

18:57.919 --> 18:59.355
drop-dead time on
target's 20 mikes.

18:59.399 --> 19:01.227
Not a second to waste.
You got it, Sonny?

19:01.270 --> 19:04.099
Yeesh. So, no, uh, stop
at the food court, then?

19:10.497 --> 19:12.499
Okay, I think he knows.

19:22.813 --> 19:26.295
All departments, set conditions
for ThreatCon Dog Zebra.

19:26.339 --> 19:29.168
Battle stations.
Battle stations.

19:33.563 --> 19:35.522
I'm assuming
this is not a drill?

19:35.565 --> 19:38.655
The sub that's been trailing us
has been identified as Chinese.

19:38.699 --> 19:41.615
The captain's concerned about
them breaching the ship's data.

19:41.658 --> 19:44.095
And we're not
taking any chances.

19:44.139 --> 19:45.793
Does that mean that
we're full comms blackout?

19:45.836 --> 19:48.012
We're in the dark while Bravo's
in the middle of an op?

19:57.544 --> 20:00.982
I've approved an encrypted line
for your drone feed

20:01.025 --> 20:03.941
and a data burst text
to Bravo's MBITR to inform them

20:03.985 --> 20:05.639
of the situation.
Be vague.

20:05.682 --> 20:09.120
Copy.
We get one message

20:09.164 --> 20:10.774
to let Bravo know
that their comms are out.

20:10.818 --> 20:12.472
I think command set aside
the no-contact

20:12.515 --> 20:13.821
order because
of the ThreatCon.

20:13.864 --> 20:15.953
If you need to step out,

20:15.997 --> 20:17.172
I got this.

20:17.216 --> 20:18.521
Wouldn't give him
the satisfaction.

20:22.351 --> 20:24.353
Ready?

20:28.444 --> 20:30.577
Ship's in ThreatCon Zebra.

20:30.620 --> 20:32.318
We've lost all comms with Havoc.

20:32.361 --> 20:34.189
That's no-go criteria.

20:34.233 --> 20:36.496
We know the plan.
We can do it blind.

20:41.588 --> 20:43.285
Stop the truck, Ray.

20:43.329 --> 20:44.982
Guards are watching.

20:45.026 --> 20:46.332
This truck get squirrely,

20:46.375 --> 20:47.681
they will never
let us in again.

20:47.724 --> 20:49.726
This happens now or it
doesn't happen at all.

21:10.878 --> 21:12.488
What's he doing?

21:13.794 --> 21:15.665
Ah, looks like he's thirsty.

21:19.452 --> 21:21.497
Jug. Give me the jug of water.
Hurry up.

21:21.541 --> 21:22.672
That's it.
Come on.

23:17.613 --> 23:20.486
Brock, Metal, take the backside
of hostage target.

23:20.529 --> 23:22.313
-Dual entry on my call.
-All right.

23:22.357 --> 23:23.489
We'll rally back here in 20.

23:23.532 --> 23:24.533
Sooner the better.

23:36.893 --> 23:38.852
Bravo 2,
approaching primary.

23:40.680 --> 23:42.682
Bravo 5, you and Metal

23:42.725 --> 23:44.292
take the backside,
dual entry on me.

23:44.335 --> 23:45.946
Copy, Bravo 1. We're set.

23:45.989 --> 23:47.643
Didn't Jace already
make that call?

24:25.638 --> 24:27.683
-See what you need?
-Oh, yeah.

24:27.727 --> 24:31.121
Boko's own cell phones will seed
a backdoor into the network.

24:31.165 --> 24:33.472
You see a green light,

24:33.515 --> 24:35.474
we're good.

24:38.389 --> 24:39.739
Something Havoc
might've helped with?

25:05.504 --> 25:07.375
Bravo 1, this is 2.
We have jackpot.

25:07.418 --> 25:09.682
Heading back to the truck now.
What's your ETA?

25:09.725 --> 25:11.684
That's a negative.
We need you over here now.

25:54.988 --> 25:56.598
What can we do for the rest?

25:56.642 --> 25:58.948
Well, we set them loose, we got

25:58.992 --> 26:01.429
how we get them to the truck
without getting spotted,

26:01.472 --> 26:03.910
and not to mention
this ain't gonna be easy for us,

26:03.953 --> 26:06.521
but, uh, we ain't
got room for 'em.

26:06.565 --> 26:07.566
We can't just
leave them here.

26:10.786 --> 26:12.179
Burning time.

26:12.222 --> 26:13.310
Let's go.

26:13.354 --> 26:16.096
All right, Clay, Metal.

26:16.139 --> 26:17.706
I want you to get, uh,
names and clear videos

26:17.750 --> 26:18.925
of each hostage.
Got it?

26:18.968 --> 26:20.187
What does this accomplish?

26:20.230 --> 26:21.710
Get the local intel to G5

26:21.754 --> 26:23.320
once CIA's looked
at the servers.

26:23.364 --> 26:25.235
Then they come by and scoop up
the rest of the prisoners.

26:25.279 --> 26:26.236
Best option on the table.

26:26.280 --> 26:27.760
Yep. Let's move.
Quick. Let's go.

26:27.803 --> 26:29.065
Let's go.

26:32.678 --> 26:34.288
Made the right call, Jace.

26:35.811 --> 26:37.552
Why are they still in there
with the hostage?

26:37.596 --> 26:39.554
I don't know,
but look at this.

26:39.598 --> 26:41.774
War party's returning.

26:41.817 --> 26:43.558
And we can't warn Bravo.

26:45.516 --> 26:47.257
I'm originally
from Kano state,

26:47.301 --> 26:49.042
but my village is Madobi.

26:49.085 --> 26:50.217
It is not far.

26:50.260 --> 26:51.610
You can take me there.

26:51.653 --> 26:53.046
Okay. Let's go.
Hey, we got to move.

26:53.089 --> 26:54.395
We're at the drop-dead time
on target.

26:54.438 --> 26:56.440
-We got to go. Come on.
-Please.

26:56.484 --> 26:58.181
We've been here so long.

26:58.225 --> 26:59.443
I'm sorry. There's nothing
I can do right now.

26:59.487 --> 27:01.620
I'm sorry.
It's all we can do.

27:01.663 --> 27:03.099
Sorry. Sorry.

27:03.143 --> 27:04.753
We got to move. Let's go.

27:06.494 --> 27:08.322
What?

27:08.365 --> 27:12.065
The most powerful warriors
are patience and time.

27:17.766 --> 27:21.204
Please, wait!
Wait!

27:21.248 --> 27:23.598
Wait! Please!

27:23.642 --> 27:25.818
-Help us!
-Help us! Help us!

27:27.428 --> 27:30.692
Please, help us!

27:35.436 --> 27:38.047
wait, help us!

27:43.183 --> 27:44.880
Wait!

27:44.924 --> 27:47.100
Ah, ah, ah!

27:48.188 --> 27:50.581
Help!

27:56.326 --> 27:58.720
Ray. Ray!

27:58.764 --> 28:00.026
Hey, Ray, you hear me?

28:00.069 --> 28:01.201
Team's loaded in.
Let's move.

28:01.244 --> 28:02.550
-Move, move, move! Come on.
-Yeah.

28:02.593 --> 28:04.552
Roger that.

28:12.560 --> 28:15.084
Uh-oh.
They're back.

28:21.177 --> 28:24.920
Bravo, be advised.
War party's coming in.

28:54.297 --> 28:55.864
They don't know we're in here,
all right?

28:55.908 --> 28:57.866
-They're just getting rowdy.
-You sure about that?

29:00.434 --> 29:01.870
I'm out.

29:07.441 --> 29:08.703
They're out.

29:08.747 --> 29:09.965
They're good.

29:10.009 --> 29:12.185
No.
Not until they're back here.

29:22.282 --> 29:24.588
Convoy of vehicles
from the direction of the camp.

29:25.938 --> 29:27.200
Hauling ass.

29:27.243 --> 29:28.636
Moving faster than we can.

29:28.679 --> 29:30.769
Puts them on us before
we're anywhere near exfil.

29:30.812 --> 29:34.294
Bravo 1, we got three vehicles
en route from target,

29:34.337 --> 29:37.123
about five klicks back
and gaining. Over.

29:37.166 --> 29:38.820
Probably found the dead guard.

29:40.996 --> 29:42.650
Copy that. How long
till they're on us?

29:42.693 --> 29:44.826
Ten mikes if we're lucky.

29:44.870 --> 29:46.262
Sonny, give me demo count.

29:46.306 --> 29:47.916
Everyone's loaded out,
plus mine.

29:47.960 --> 29:49.309
Why?

29:50.876 --> 29:53.313
Bravo 2, got a cluster of
buildings. It looks abandoned.

29:53.356 --> 29:54.749
One klick ahead.

29:57.099 --> 29:58.231
Oh, boy.

30:08.284 --> 30:09.895
What are they doing?

30:09.938 --> 30:11.810
They think they're
gonna take shelter there?

30:11.853 --> 30:13.986
Jason's got to have a plan.

30:14.029 --> 30:15.901
All right.
The tanker's rigged to blow.

30:15.944 --> 30:17.554
Let's hope they choose
door number one.

30:17.598 --> 30:18.947
-Okay, let's hope so,
or we're gonna get outgunned.

30:18.991 --> 30:20.340
I'll take Parker,

30:20.383 --> 30:21.820
put some distance between
him and any firefight.

30:21.863 --> 30:23.169
Bravo 6.
-Come with me, sir.

30:23.212 --> 30:24.823
Bravo 2 is moving the hotel
to another position.

30:24.866 --> 30:27.390
You guys stay here.
We'll move to another building.

30:32.134 --> 30:33.832
Copy, 1.
I have eyes on.

30:44.930 --> 30:46.757
Look alive, Bravo.

30:46.801 --> 30:48.281
Kids are in the pool.

30:55.679 --> 30:57.159
Bravo 2, be advised.

30:57.203 --> 30:58.639
We got two tangos moving
towards your location.

30:58.682 --> 30:59.988
Should've kept Ray with us.

31:00.032 --> 31:01.076
Ray's gonna be fine.

31:01.120 --> 31:02.382
Bravo 2 copies.

31:02.425 --> 31:04.036
-Two tangos headed my way.
-They're coming. No.

31:04.079 --> 31:05.864
No. No, no, no!

31:05.907 --> 31:07.604
I can't go back, please.
I beg of you, please.

31:07.648 --> 31:09.476
They're coming.
You cannot... Hush.

31:10.520 --> 31:12.348
Just breathe.
Just breathe, all right?

31:12.392 --> 31:13.567
You're gonna have to be quiet.

31:13.610 --> 31:15.743
-I'm here with you, okay?
-Okay.

31:25.796 --> 31:28.060
Bravo 1, tangos are
in the decoy building.

31:28.103 --> 31:29.844
Good copy.
Technical's in the clear.

31:29.888 --> 31:31.454
Listen, we got two vehicles
in our blast zone.

31:31.498 --> 31:33.413
We're gonna need two
operable ones for our exfil.

31:33.456 --> 31:35.937
No visual on the two tangos
who were moving Ray's direction.

31:35.981 --> 31:41.116
Bravo 2, what's your sitrep?

31:43.162 --> 31:44.815
Ray's gone quiet.

31:44.859 --> 31:47.166
-We got to find out why.
-Bravo 3,

31:47.209 --> 31:48.602
do not detonate till
Clay gives you the go.

31:48.645 --> 31:50.212
Copy 1.

31:51.431 --> 31:53.999
Too bad they didn't get the memo
where we needed them to park.

31:54.042 --> 31:56.305
That SUV is still idling.

31:56.349 --> 31:57.611
I can move it
from the blast zone.

31:57.654 --> 32:00.527
All right, that plus
the Technical equals two.

32:00.570 --> 32:02.311
Gonna have to sprint
past the Technical

32:02.355 --> 32:03.617
to get to it.

32:03.660 --> 32:05.401
I'm faster, I'll go.

32:06.707 --> 32:08.709
I don't have a kid
to think about.

32:10.798 --> 32:11.799
6, this is 3.

32:11.842 --> 32:12.974
Metal's making a run
for the SUV.

32:13.018 --> 32:14.802
Clear a path.

32:33.255 --> 32:34.256
Bravo 3, turn steel,

32:34.300 --> 32:35.301
turn steel, turn steel.

32:49.184 --> 32:50.838
Get to the Technical.

32:50.881 --> 32:52.796
Yeah, Metal!
Full Metal! That's it.

32:54.711 --> 32:56.452
Go, Metal. Go, go, go!

32:58.715 --> 32:59.978
Ray, I'm coming to your pos.

33:06.027 --> 33:07.333
Ray!

33:15.906 --> 33:17.386
All clear.

33:19.084 --> 33:20.650
Nice cleanup, Ray.

33:20.694 --> 33:22.304
Bravo 1, this is 6.
Second vehicle acquired.

33:22.348 --> 33:24.611
External's secured.

33:24.654 --> 33:27.005
Bravo 1 copies all.

33:30.486 --> 33:32.314
Sorry.

33:32.358 --> 33:34.055
You got nothing to be
sorry for, sir.

33:34.099 --> 33:36.275
I was just afraid.

33:36.318 --> 33:38.146
So close to getting
my life back,

33:38.190 --> 33:39.495
seeing my family again.

33:39.539 --> 33:41.584
You're gonna see them soon.

33:41.628 --> 33:44.935
I can't believe it's over.

33:44.979 --> 33:46.676
It's over.

33:48.678 --> 33:51.290
They can't
hurt me anymore.

33:51.333 --> 33:52.943
Uh...

33:52.987 --> 33:54.771
You're going home.

33:56.469 --> 33:59.037
Attention on deck.
General Quarters is moving

33:59.080 --> 34:02.083
to ThreatCon Yoke.
Resume normal operations.

34:02.127 --> 34:04.564
Bravo 1, this is Havoc.

34:04.607 --> 34:05.956
Comms are back online,

34:06.000 --> 34:07.610
but we caught the whole show
on ISR.

34:07.654 --> 34:09.351
Copy, Havoc.
Bravo passes jackpot.

34:09.395 --> 34:11.527
En route to exfil.

34:11.571 --> 34:13.877
Copy, Bravo 1.
Not bad for being in the dark.

34:21.363 --> 34:23.539
No-contact order
is back in effect.

34:23.583 --> 34:27.326
Yeah, until the "needs of
the Navy" take priority again.

34:27.369 --> 34:29.937
See, all the talk about
addressing these problems--

34:29.980 --> 34:33.636
it's still warfighting
over warfighters.

34:33.680 --> 34:35.160
Look, you've got to trust that

34:35.203 --> 34:37.118
this investigation's gonna
bear out.

34:37.162 --> 34:39.947
And I will be here with you,
no matter what.

34:39.990 --> 34:42.123
I got it.

34:48.434 --> 34:51.437
Nice shooting today
there on Sad Hill.

34:51.480 --> 34:53.917
Between you, me and Metal,
it was a true

34:53.961 --> 34:55.963
<i>"Good, the Bad, and the Ugly."</i>

34:56.006 --> 34:57.573
You need to come clean
to Jason.

34:57.617 --> 35:00.141
I thought we cleansed you
of your cake-eating ways.

35:00.185 --> 35:02.187
If you want to sabotage
your own life,

35:02.230 --> 35:04.145
fine, okay?

35:04.189 --> 35:06.887
But you got to stop bringing
everybody else down around you.

35:06.930 --> 35:08.671
Oh, if we could only
all just be like you,

35:08.715 --> 35:11.109
lifting everyone up lucky enough
to be in your presence.

35:11.152 --> 35:14.286
You know, Stella
really hit the jackpot

35:14.329 --> 35:15.374
with your arrogant ass.

35:15.417 --> 35:16.462
Telling you to get
your act together

35:16.505 --> 35:18.159
doesn't make me arrogant.

35:18.203 --> 35:19.769
All right? It might...
it might make me stupid

35:19.813 --> 35:21.815
for thinking that
-you could ever evolve.
-Oh, thinking that

35:21.858 --> 35:24.687
you're gonna be Jason Hayes
on a battlefield

35:24.731 --> 35:26.559
and Ray Perry off?

35:26.602 --> 35:28.952
That's creating a species
of Frogman that doesn't exist.

35:28.996 --> 35:30.737
So, real humble.

35:30.780 --> 35:32.478
Okay, well, excuse me
for trying to get better, right?

35:32.521 --> 35:34.175
Rather than just accepting
I'm gonna come up short

35:34.219 --> 35:36.177
on everything I try to achieve.

35:36.221 --> 35:40.529
The difference between you and I
is that I live in reality.

35:40.573 --> 35:42.618
-Oh, really?
-I know exactly who I am.

35:42.662 --> 35:45.708
Mm-hmm. Same reality that had
you lying to me all week?

35:45.752 --> 35:47.928
-That reality?
-The only person

35:47.971 --> 35:50.496
that's lying here is you.

35:50.539 --> 35:52.933
To yourself and to Stella.

35:52.976 --> 35:55.805
What, you think you're gonna
skate through this job clean?

35:55.849 --> 35:57.807
Comms go out,
ops stick with you.

35:57.851 --> 35:58.939
People around you
get hurt.

35:58.982 --> 36:00.593
And it's not just
the ones kitting up.

36:00.636 --> 36:02.029
But you go on, Clay.

36:02.072 --> 36:03.596
You keep pretending that...

36:03.639 --> 36:06.251
that it ain't this life.

36:08.122 --> 36:10.342
I see you already got your
excuses to tell your daughter.

36:20.917 --> 36:23.355
They want to interview me
for that SOCOM job.

36:25.052 --> 36:26.749
The one you've been
hoping for, right?

36:26.793 --> 36:28.055
Yeah.

36:28.098 --> 36:30.318
Congratulations.

36:30.362 --> 36:32.277
-You deserve it.
-Thanks.

36:32.320 --> 36:35.497
They said you were in
here. Chief Hassan,

36:35.541 --> 36:37.238
would you like to
come with me to discuss

36:37.282 --> 36:38.326
the investigation?

36:38.370 --> 36:41.024
You can say whatever
you need to here.

36:43.462 --> 36:45.246
The investigation has concluded.

36:45.290 --> 36:47.553
Wait, already?

36:47.596 --> 36:49.946
I-I thought it takes,
uh, two weeks.

36:49.990 --> 36:54.690
Less, if a clear picture
emerges.

36:54.734 --> 36:56.388
Lieutenant Commander Whitshaw
is being counseled

36:56.431 --> 36:58.564
for conduct unbecoming
of an officer.

36:58.607 --> 37:00.914
It will be reflected
in his FITREP.

37:00.957 --> 37:04.831
Otherwise, no further action
will be taken.

37:04.874 --> 37:08.574
-Wha... That's it?
-Since it was harassment

37:08.617 --> 37:11.229
rather than assault,

37:11.272 --> 37:14.057
command discretion
plays a bigger role.

37:14.101 --> 37:16.451
And given the current
strategic circumstances...

37:16.495 --> 37:19.324
It's warfighting
over warfighters.

37:19.367 --> 37:21.761
Cards on the table,

37:21.804 --> 37:23.893
J.G. Davis,
you failed to inform me

37:23.937 --> 37:26.592
that you had some
unresolved past animosity

37:26.635 --> 37:28.289
against Lieutenant Commander
Whitshaw.

37:28.333 --> 37:29.638
Wait a minute, this has
nothing to do with me.

37:29.682 --> 37:31.205
If I had known, perhaps
Whitshaw's assertion

37:31.249 --> 37:34.077
that this matter was really
about exercising your grudge

37:34.121 --> 37:36.732
would have carried less weight
with the investigative team.

37:36.776 --> 37:38.168
She was trying to help me.

37:38.212 --> 37:40.301
May have been better
ways to do that.

37:40.345 --> 37:44.958
But if Lieutenant Commander
Whitshaw

37:45.001 --> 37:48.091
retaliates again...

37:48.135 --> 37:50.093
you both know where to find me.

38:02.671 --> 38:04.020
I'm sorry.

38:04.064 --> 38:06.675
No, don't be.

38:06.719 --> 38:09.287
The whole process
is a minefield. I'll be fine.

38:25.738 --> 38:27.914
Ray.

38:27.957 --> 38:30.264
Yeah, just one second.

38:32.962 --> 38:34.790
Yeah, come on in.

38:37.184 --> 38:40.230
Oh.
What's got you sharking?

38:40.274 --> 38:42.058
You're usually kicking back
after a victory.

38:42.102 --> 38:44.931
Yeah, not much of a
mission success, you know,

38:44.974 --> 38:48.108
with, uh, leaving those people
behind, that's for sure.

38:48.151 --> 38:50.371
The one we saved
isn't home free either.

38:50.415 --> 38:52.112
It just killed me seeing

38:52.155 --> 38:53.592
how relieved he was,

38:53.635 --> 38:55.463
so happy that the whole
nightmare was over,

38:55.507 --> 38:58.031
when really it's just...

38:58.074 --> 39:00.250
Hard road ahead for him.

39:00.294 --> 39:02.252
Yeah.

39:02.296 --> 39:04.603
And he's doing it without
the training that allows us

39:04.646 --> 39:06.213
to handle it all.

39:06.256 --> 39:08.955
Right.

39:08.998 --> 39:10.478
He's not as lucky as you.

39:14.613 --> 39:16.658
You know, uh, Jace, uh,

39:16.702 --> 39:19.792
you were right, man.
Um...

39:19.835 --> 39:22.055
I should have been aware
of Sonny's mess.

39:22.098 --> 39:23.448
Yeah, I thought
I hammered him out last week.

39:23.491 --> 39:24.840
I'm not sure how
I'm gonna handle him now.

39:26.102 --> 39:28.061
Maybe... maybe don't.

39:28.104 --> 39:29.715
what are you saying-- I can't?

39:29.758 --> 39:32.500
No, I'm saying
you don't have to.

39:32.544 --> 39:34.197
I mean, how many times
have you let your life suffer

39:34.241 --> 39:35.373
for the sake of Bravo's?

39:36.417 --> 39:38.158
You give enough
of yourself

39:38.201 --> 39:40.813
just making sure we
get home every day.

39:40.856 --> 39:42.945
You don't own anyone
any more than that.

39:42.989 --> 39:44.425
Yeah, but what... I mean,
what's the point in getting

39:44.469 --> 39:47.689
everyone home safe if I just
ignore their six afterwards?

39:49.648 --> 39:51.998
Theo's still in your head, huh?

39:53.826 --> 39:56.524
Look, Jace, he never
wore the Bravo 1 patch.

39:56.568 --> 39:59.701
Okay? So he can't understand
the load that you carry.

40:03.357 --> 40:05.707
Either Sonny gets right
or he doesn't. It...

40:05.751 --> 40:08.101
it's not on you.

40:31.820 --> 40:34.867
Why you guys
so quiet in here?

40:34.910 --> 40:36.956
-Said all we needed to.
-Ah,

40:36.999 --> 40:38.871
right.
Thought the party wasn't over

40:38.914 --> 40:40.568
till somebody was bleeding.

40:40.612 --> 40:42.396
You got me, Jace.

40:42.440 --> 40:45.181
If you want to read me
the riot act, then...

40:45.225 --> 40:47.357
go ahead, I deserve it.

40:48.881 --> 40:51.231
Op was a win.

40:51.274 --> 40:53.451
That's all that matters.

41:08.901 --> 41:10.293
You wishing you
could do more?

41:11.425 --> 41:13.253
Those...
those prisoners

41:13.296 --> 41:15.124
back at the Boko camp--

41:15.168 --> 41:18.040
I know it's not in your DNA
to leave them behind.

41:19.085 --> 41:21.130
Prisoners aren't
the only ones I've let down.

41:22.175 --> 41:23.306
Lot of that going around.

41:23.350 --> 41:24.612
Yeah?

41:27.485 --> 41:29.095
Inserted myself into a situation

41:29.138 --> 41:30.705
that I thought I could fix.

41:30.749 --> 41:32.141
I only made it worse.

41:32.185 --> 41:35.580
What, here on the ship?

41:35.623 --> 41:37.407
Anything I can do to help?

41:37.451 --> 41:39.235
Nothing.

41:39.279 --> 41:41.281
My mess.

41:44.327 --> 41:45.720
You ever regret

41:45.764 --> 41:47.243
getting involved?

41:50.595 --> 41:53.032
The problem definitely
needs working.

41:54.512 --> 41:56.601
I'm just not sure
I'm the one to fix it.
