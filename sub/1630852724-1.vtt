- Oh no, oh my gosh.
- She's vomiting.

13:21.625 --> 13:23.000
Don't you dare
vomit in my car.

13:23.083 --> 13:24.375
I just got this car cleaned.

13:26.125 --> 13:27.166
[retching]

13:27.250 --> 13:29.625
Don't get it on my shoes,
please.

13:31.000 --> 13:31.958
You are allergic to dogs,

13:32.041 --> 13:33.750
and now you're allergic to cats,
okay?

Is your name Zakki? [laughing]

14:21.500 --> 14:23.041
I'm so tired.

14:26.333 --> 14:28.291
Oh, you're here.

14:29.250 --> 14:30.875
You can sleep here.

14:31.041 --> 14:32.500
That's a good idea.

14:33.958 --> 14:36.250
Do you like it? Hi!

14:36.958 --> 14:39.333
Now [laughs].

14:39.416 --> 14:42.333
I have a great bedtime
story for you, listen.

14:44.000 --> 14:47.458
My uncle's last will [laughs].

14:49.041 --> 14:51.791
Last will because
he's like, yeah.

14:52.750 --> 14:57.333
An inheritance of the property
owned by the deceased.

14:57.416 --> 14:58.583
That's him.

14:58.666 --> 15:00.458
And the deed of his death.

15:00.541 --> 15:02.916
You have to claim the property

15:03.000 --> 15:05.916
of the hotel Montreau Bleau.

15:06.958 --> 15:08.875
On September 7th.

[cork popping]

15:11.500 --> 15:13.083
At 12 PM.

15:13.333 --> 15:18.583
So tomorrow, I'll be
outrageously rich.

15:20.708 --> 15:22.166
I think I had enough.

15:23.666 --> 15:24.375
Yeah.

15:26.375 --> 15:27.291
Good night.

15:28.166 --> 15:29.000

16:28.083 --> 16:30.583
Monsieur Porteur, what
are you doing?

16:31.416 --> 16:32.916
I'm trying to find
a place to put

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
the portrait of
Monsieur Bloomberg.

16:35.458 --> 16:36.000
Ah.

16:40.041 --> 16:41.083
But it's all wrinkly.

16:41.458 --> 16:42.625
Where did you find it?

16:43.458 --> 16:44.958
I found it in the shed.

16:45.250 --> 16:46.250
Ah, in the shed.

16:46.750 --> 16:49.625
Why don't you put it in
the Presidential Suite?

16:51.500 --> 16:54.750
But it's tradition
to display the portrait

16:54.833 --> 16:56.458
of the owner when he visits.

16:56.666 --> 17:00.625
Yes, but it's not 1990
anymore, so we can do away

17:00.708 --> 17:03.166
with the tradition of hanging
the owner's portrait up.

17:03.791 --> 17:06.291
So, put it in the
Presidential Suite.

17:07.958 --> 17:08.750
Okay.

17:15.583 --> 17:17.791
[birds chirping]

17:23.208 --> 17:25.875
Oh, uh, are you kidding?

That was supposed to be
my breakfast.

Are you kidding me?

19:12.458 --> 19:14.208
It's the long weekend,
I'm not doing it.

19:14.291 --> 19:15.083
You can do it yourself.

Who was it?

19:19.791 --> 19:20.333
Brigitte.

19:21.125 --> 19:23.750
She wanted me to bring food
for a client at the chalet.

19:24.458 --> 19:25.208
So you go.

19:27.250 --> 19:29.666
Frank, we're playing cards
here. We're having a good time.

19:30.625 --> 19:34.833
When my daughter asks you
to go, it's necessary, you go!

19:35.125 --> 19:38.333
It's crucial to keep the
cover going on.

19:38.416 --> 19:39.958
And, please, put the chair back.

19:41.750 --> 19:42.291

should be there by now.

number here?

24:42.291 --> 24:42.791
Okay.

24:44.875 --> 24:47.375
So, we didn't find any
documents on you.

24:47.458 --> 24:48.458
Do you remember your name?

Do you remember your name?

Sure.

Thank you.

25:06.208 --> 25:06.916
What's your name?

25:08.166 --> 25:09.541
Did someone ask you
to intervene?

25:10.625 --> 25:13.333
When the time comes, and
you remember your own name,

25:14.500 --> 25:16.250
then you can participate, okay?

Where am I?

St. Geraniums.

25:23.541 --> 25:25.333
We specialize in concussions.

25:26.916 --> 25:27.833
How did I get here?

25:29.458 --> 25:30.708
You fell off your bicycle.

25:31.750 --> 25:34.083
An unknown woman saved
you from certain death.

25:34.666 --> 25:36.875
She held your tongue so
you couldn't swallow it.

25:37.500 --> 25:38.625
Then she called the ambulance.

25:38.750 --> 25:40.291
Wow, that's amazing.

25:40.666 --> 25:41.750
Do we at least know her name?

25:42.500 --> 25:43.500
What did I just tell you?

25:44.041 --> 25:45.500
You concentrate on
your own name.

25:46.333 --> 25:47.875
You know, you've been
here for 36 hours

25:47.958 --> 25:50.125
and can't even remember
such basic information.

25:51.416 --> 25:53.125
Don't worry, not you.

25:53.958 --> 25:56.000
This is classic
retrograde amnesia.

25:56.416 --> 25:58.875
It should last
maximum day or two.

25:59.833 --> 26:01.291
You might even have your
short-term memory

26:01.375 --> 26:02.583
back by this evening.

26:03.166 --> 26:05.000
This one's basically
just pretending.

26:05.500 --> 26:06.458
Has it too good here.

26:07.166 --> 26:08.916
I'm not pretending.
I just don't remember.

26:09.625 --> 26:11.333
And he cries just like
a little baby.

26:12.125 --> 26:14.416
I will report you,
and you will be fired.

26:15.625 --> 26:17.125
I'm coming back with
some medication.

26:17.500 --> 26:18.833
It'll help you sleep
through the night.

27:02.083 --> 27:03.125
[Fabio] Uh, boss I was just,

27:03.458 --> 27:04.583
bringing back
the groceries.

27:05.458 --> 27:07.666
- Bring back the groceries.
- I went to the chalet,

27:07.750 --> 27:08.541
There was nobody there.

27:12.458 --> 27:13.375
- Hi, Papa.

27:14.000 --> 27:15.541
She was not at the chalet.

27:16.041 --> 27:16.958
She was at the lake.

27:17.666 --> 27:18.666
There was nobody there.

27:20.250 --> 27:22.375
She was at the lake, stupido.

27:23.208 --> 27:24.125
At the lake.

Aw.

Go.

27:48.375 --> 27:49.791
Oh, oh.

27:52.583 --> 27:54.041
She did not show up?

27:56.583 --> 27:57.666
[sighing]

27:58.625 --> 27:59.458
Strange.

28:02.125 --> 28:04.208
I will try to reach her, mm-hm.

28:04.750 --> 28:06.875
Thank you, thank you very
much, dear colleague.

There you go.

28:39.541 --> 28:40.625
It's all relative.

28:41.916 --> 28:44.000
Tomorrow, we have to make it.

28:49.750 --> 28:51.000

We can do it.

28:59.708 --> 29:00.625
in Mont Tremblant.

29:00.791 --> 29:02.041
Today, we're happy to report

29:02.125 --> 29:03.041
that a special guest

29:03.125 --> 29:04.333
will be visiting our city.

29:04.541 --> 29:07.166
Celebrity chef and travel
show host Tom Cook

29:07.250 --> 29:09.250
is filming a new series in
Mont Tremblant.

29:09.500 --> 29:11.333
Be on the lookout for
the GeoHunt host

29:11.416 --> 29:12.375
as he interviews locals--

29:12.458 --> 29:13.375
Where is he?

29:19.875 --> 29:21.958
[sobs]

29:23.625 --> 29:24.458
[Bradley] Psst.

29:26.833 --> 29:27.625
Hey.

29:30.000 --> 29:30.791
Hey.

29:31.291 --> 29:32.083
What?

29:33.375 --> 29:34.750
Why did you let her
bother you like that?

29:35.375 --> 29:36.125
She's just a bully.

29:37.916 --> 29:39.250
I didn't do anything wrong?

29:40.083 --> 29:41.916
All I asked was how I
ended up here.

29:44.291 --> 29:45.958
[phone vibrating]

29:46.333 --> 29:47.083
Did you hear that?

29:50.166 --> 29:51.375
[phone vibrating]

29:53.375 --> 29:54.208
Take it out.

29:58.083 --> 29:58.916
[phone vibrating]

30:02.291 --> 30:04.791
Put your finger on it,
and just slide it.

30:08.000 --> 30:08.916
Hello?

30:09.625 --> 30:11.583
Hi, Bradley?

30:14.125 --> 30:14.916
Bradley.

30:16.000 --> 30:16.791
Of course.

30:17.666 --> 30:19.375
Bradley, that's [laughs],

30:19.625 --> 30:21.916
that's me, yes, hi, I'm Bradley.

30:22.958 --> 30:23.916
Ask who she is.

30:24.000 --> 30:25.666
[stutters] Who is this?

30:25.958 --> 30:27.791
[laughs] You're so silly.

30:28.041 --> 30:29.250
It's Brigitte.

30:30.083 --> 30:30.916
Brigitte?

30:32.083 --> 30:33.333
[Bradley] Hey.

30:35.125 --> 30:36.333
Ask how she is.

30:36.791 --> 30:37.625
How are you?

30:37.875 --> 30:40.541
I'm good, I'm good. And you?

30:41.500 --> 30:42.291
I'm fine.

30:43.416 --> 30:45.083
I was in an accident.

30:45.166 --> 30:46.666
I fell off my bicycle.

30:46.750 --> 30:47.583
But it's okay.

30:47.916 --> 30:48.833
I'm at the hospital,

30:48.916 --> 30:49.875
actually, but

30:50.875 --> 30:52.875
they're taking really
good care of me, so...

30:53.291 --> 30:54.291
I am good.

30:54.833 --> 30:56.083
Oh no!

30:56.500 --> 30:58.000
Well I hope you'll be fine.

30:58.458 --> 31:00.083
Are we still on for
Monday evening?

31:00.166 --> 31:03.958
[chuckles] This is my
daughter. Isn't she great?

31:04.375 --> 31:05.291
I don't think so.

31:07.083 --> 31:09.458
Fabio, this early
in the morning,

31:09.708 --> 31:12.375
and she's taking care
of business.

31:12.458 --> 31:13.708
Taking care of business?

31:14.250 --> 31:15.083
That's what you call that?

31:15.666 --> 31:17.083
Talking on the phone,
flirting with someone,

31:17.166 --> 31:18.041
taking care of business?

31:18.208 --> 31:19.666
Hey, Fabio, what's
wrong with you?

31:20.375 --> 31:21.541
She's working,

31:21.625 --> 31:24.041
- on the owner of Trinwest.
- Mm-hmm.

31:24.125 --> 31:25.958
- Don't you know that?
- Right.

31:26.375 --> 31:27.583
Ask her where she wants
you to meet her.

31:27.666 --> 31:29.750
Where were we meeting
again, Monday evening?

31:30.041 --> 31:31.083
You make me laugh.

31:31.166 --> 31:33.500
At Mont Tremblant Hotel,
of course, where else?

31:33.958 --> 31:35.416
Mont Tremblant Hotel.

31:36.750 --> 31:38.583
I'm gonna go deliver
these groceries, Boss.

31:38.958 --> 31:40.750
Go, go, it's better,
don't lose your time.

31:40.833 --> 31:43.083
I guess I will see you
there Monday evening.

31:43.333 --> 31:44.916
[chuckling]

31:46.041 --> 31:47.875
- Bye.
- Bye now.

31:53.708 --> 31:54.583
Mont Tremblant.

31:55.125 --> 31:56.333
Mont Tremblant.

32:00.958 --> 32:02.208
Mont Tremblant.

32:03.375 --> 32:04.166
Mont Tremblant.

32:05.208 --> 32:06.958
[light music]

32:37.916 --> 32:38.750
Wow!

32:40.041 --> 32:41.458
[laughing]

32:42.375 --> 32:43.041
Zakki!

32:46.125 --> 32:46.666
Zakki.

32:50.208 --> 32:50.916
[car key alert beeps]

32:59.416 --> 33:00.250
[Fabio] Ma'am!

33:02.083 --> 33:03.333
I have some groceries for you.

33:03.875 --> 33:04.416
Hi!

33:04.500 --> 33:06.166
[Fabio] Hi, I'm gonna
place your groceries

33:06.250 --> 33:07.958
- just right here, okay?
- Finally, thank you,

33:08.041 --> 33:09.916
- put it there on the table.
- Okay.

33:15.208 --> 33:17.333
- All right. I'm heading out--
- No, no no no, come.

33:17.666 --> 33:19.708
Uh, I need your help.

33:20.541 --> 33:21.208
What do you need?

33:22.208 --> 33:24.375
Can you drive me to
Mon- Montreau Bleau?

33:25.250 --> 33:25.625
What?

33:26.416 --> 33:28.375
Montreau Blant, Bleau?

33:28.833 --> 33:30.875
- Mont Tremblant?
- Yes, that's it.

33:31.916 --> 33:33.333
Yeah, sure.
I'll meet you over here.

33:33.416 --> 33:37.166
Well, I'm, uh, I'm kind
of naked here.

33:37.250 --> 33:39.541
-[Fabio] Yeah I can see that.
- Can you bring me that thing?

33:41.166 --> 33:42.250
- Yeah.
- Yes, this one.

33:42.791 --> 33:43.416
Sure.

33:44.625 --> 33:45.875
I don't even know what this is.

33:46.416 --> 33:47.208
Can you turn?

33:47.958 --> 33:48.958
Don't, don't look.

33:49.541 --> 33:51.916
Okay, well I gotta
look where I'm walking.

33:52.166 --> 33:53.041
[Fabio] I'm not looking.

33:53.458 --> 33:54.666
No, you're not turning.
I see you.

33:54.750 --> 33:55.833
I can't see you.

33:56.041 --> 33:56.875
I promise you.

33:56.958 --> 33:57.583
Fine.

33:58.916 --> 33:59.750
I promise.

34:00.791 --> 34:02.375
Okay, there you go.

34:02.583 --> 34:03.833
-Oh.
-Okay.

34:04.583 --> 34:06.416
Ma'am, your dogs
are in my car!

34:06.500 --> 34:08.208
Oh, they are very clean dogs.

34:09.208 --> 34:10.375
They're licking everything.

34:10.916 --> 34:12.583
It's their way to say
hello to you.

34:12.666 --> 34:15.500
They just lick to imprint,
to remember you by.

34:15.791 --> 34:16.625
You know, as a matter of fact,

34:16.708 --> 34:18.458
people who lick me do tend
to remember me.

34:18.916 --> 34:20.916
Huh? Oh, I'll be right back.

34:21.375 --> 34:22.208
[Fabio] Hurry up please.

34:24.875 --> 34:25.708
Come on. Out!

34:26.416 --> 34:27.291
Get out, guys.

34:27.541 --> 34:27.958
Out.

34:28.875 --> 34:29.375
Out.

34:31.041 --> 34:31.708
Come on.

34:31.958 --> 34:34.291
Come on, come on.

34:34.708 --> 34:36.041
Okay.

34:38.416 --> 34:39.333
Look at that.

34:40.791 --> 34:42.291
[Diana] Thank you so
much for driving us.

34:42.500 --> 34:44.000
[Fabio] Not a fan of the dogs.

34:44.083 --> 34:45.083
[Diana] Thanks for them anyway.

34:45.958 --> 34:48.833
[Diana] All these rules here
against dogs, I'll change them

34:48.916 --> 34:51.500
because I'm the new owner
of the whole resort.

34:51.583 --> 34:52.833
[Fabio] You're the new owner
of the resort?

34:53.291 --> 34:54.125
[Diana] You don't believe me?

34:54.583 --> 34:55.250
There you go.

34:55.875 --> 34:56.416
Oh.

34:57.416 --> 34:58.041
Huh.

34:59.166 --> 35:00.666
That's my name. This is me.

35:03.833 --> 35:05.000
This changes everything.

35:05.333 --> 35:06.041
Really?

35:07.833 --> 35:08.833
Yes!

35:09.250 --> 35:10.208
- Yes.
- Yes!

35:10.958 --> 35:12.375
Now you like me now?

35:13.166 --> 35:14.875
No sorry, it has nothing
to do with you.

35:16.083 --> 35:18.083
You must stop by tomorrow,
and I will treat you

35:18.166 --> 35:19.541
like a VIP guest.

35:20.083 --> 35:20.958
Yeah, sounds good.

35:21.166 --> 35:21.916
At my expense.

35:26.250 --> 35:29.000
[engine humming]

35:40.291 --> 35:41.250
So, it's a date?

35:44.791 --> 35:45.500
Chop-chop.

35:47.166 --> 35:48.166
[dogs barking]

35:49.000 --> 35:50.666
[Fabio] Yes, hello, Brigitte?

35:50.833 --> 35:52.583
Hi, yeah, so,

35:52.666 --> 35:55.041
you have a date with the
owner of Trinwest, right?

35:56.125 --> 35:57.083
Right, well I don't know where

35:57.166 --> 35:59.041
you're getting your information
from, but I just dropped off

35:59.125 --> 36:02.333
the real and authentic
owner of the resort.

36:03.333 --> 36:04.125
Right, that girl.

36:05.375 --> 36:06.875
I have a date with her tomorrow.

36:09.208 --> 36:10.875
[M. Porteur] I'll
call security.

36:12.833 --> 36:15.291
No no no, madame,
please, exit.

36:15.375 --> 36:16.250
Who are you?

36:16.333 --> 36:17.791
S'il vous plait, madame,
you must leave right now--

36:17.875 --> 36:18.958
Oh, you're so fired.

36:19.041 --> 36:21.041
I'm sorry, but dogs
of this size

36:21.125 --> 36:22.791
are not allowed in our
establishment.

36:22.875 --> 36:25.166
This dumb rule is not
in force anymore.

36:25.291 --> 36:26.208
I'm changing it.

36:26.333 --> 36:27.291
I'm banning the ban.

36:27.541 --> 36:28.541
And before you leave,

36:28.625 --> 36:30.583
don't forget to return
your ugly uniform.

36:30.958 --> 36:32.416
Do you want me to
call security?

36:32.500 --> 36:35.000
Please, if you wanna call
somebody, call the director.

36:35.583 --> 36:36.250
I'm Maxa.

36:37.708 --> 36:38.750
Diana Maxa.

36:39.458 --> 36:40.625
I'm the owner of this.

36:40.833 --> 36:42.833
- All this. [titters]
- I don't--

36:43.041 --> 36:44.041
Hello.

36:44.291 --> 36:45.041
Hello.

36:45.250 --> 36:47.166
Did you bring the dogs?

36:47.333 --> 36:48.125
Yes, I did.

36:48.208 --> 36:51.041
Mm-hmm, why don't you
come this way?

36:51.166 --> 36:52.125
Thank you very much.

36:52.625 --> 36:53.416
You see?

36:54.708 --> 36:55.666
Panic button.

37:01.875 --> 37:04.333
Oh, and look around
for Bailiff of Justice.

37:04.708 --> 37:07.583
I have an appointment with
him to take over my property.

37:07.666 --> 37:09.708
Perhaps you can explain to
be how you can possibly be

37:09.791 --> 37:12.541
the owner of this
publicly listed hotel.

37:12.625 --> 37:14.083
Well, it's none of
your business.

37:14.458 --> 37:16.208
But, I have the proof.

37:16.291 --> 37:17.333
That would surprise me.

37:17.416 --> 37:18.333
Ha, really?

37:18.416 --> 37:21.125
Well the bailiff is waiting
for me since yesterday.

37:21.333 --> 37:22.333
What can you do about it?

37:22.458 --> 37:24.291
You know, if ownership
of this place had changed,

37:24.375 --> 37:25.291
we'd have heard about it.

37:25.583 --> 37:29.333
And Mister Bradley Bloomberg
is on his way over today.

37:29.583 --> 37:31.791
He's the principal shareholder
in Trinwest, which is the

37:31.875 --> 37:33.416
- actual owner of the hotel.
-Ha, ha ha.

37:33.500 --> 37:34.916
- I don't think so.
- Oh, I do think so.

37:35.000 --> 37:35.916
Oh, look who's here,

37:36.375 --> 37:37.875
- the police.
- I'm the owner of this--

37:37.958 --> 37:39.958
Owner,
meet the police.

37:40.083 --> 37:40.666
Hello.

37:41.333 --> 37:43.875
Ma'am, why don't we
talk about this outside?

37:44.166 --> 37:45.500
You have no right to do this,

37:45.583 --> 37:47.041
and I'm not leaving my property.

37:47.375 --> 37:48.708
- Okay, let's go.

37:48.916 --> 37:51.125
No, don't you dare
touch me like this.

37:51.208 --> 37:53.041
I will sue you, and
you're fired, Mister.

37:53.125 --> 37:54.000
And you're in big trouble.

37:54.083 --> 37:54.708
Get her dogs.

37:54.833 --> 37:56.791
Zakki, Coco, let's go.

37:56.916 --> 37:58.375
- Bye-bye.
- [Diana] I'm the owner of this.

37:58.708 --> 38:00.458
I'm the owner of this property!

38:03.000 --> 38:04.583
[exhales]

38:05.625 --> 38:07.958
[feet stepping]

38:13.000 --> 38:14.791
This is absolutely ridiculous.

38:14.875 --> 38:16.583
I'm telling you, I'm the
owner of this,

38:16.666 --> 38:18.333
and these people are
restraining me

38:18.416 --> 38:19.875
from entering my own property.

38:19.958 --> 38:20.625
I told you.

38:22.916 --> 38:25.333
[somber music]

38:27.458 --> 38:29.125
Take away the handcuffs.

38:31.500 --> 38:33.375
Ow, ow, ow, please.

38:51.916 --> 38:52.625
[Diana sighs]

38:53.333 --> 38:54.666
Oh my God.

38:58.541 --> 38:59.250
Okay.

39:02.000 --> 39:02.791
And another one.

39:04.875 --> 39:05.458
See?

39:07.916 --> 39:08.708
I told you.

39:12.125 --> 39:14.041
This is an address
in the village.

39:15.500 --> 39:16.750
You're at the resort.

39:18.833 --> 39:20.833
There are two Hotels
Mont Tremblant?

39:22.125 --> 39:22.916
Yes, madame.

39:23.916 --> 39:27.791
One at the resort and the
other, in the village.

39:28.791 --> 39:29.625
Oh.

39:31.916 --> 39:32.875
Hmm.

39:43.750 --> 39:44.583
I see.

39:46.875 --> 39:47.833
Can you take me there?

39:49.750 --> 39:50.583
Please?

39:56.250 --> 39:57.291
[car engine starts]

40:05.750 --> 40:08.166
Uh, uh I'm not done.

1:07:30.000 --> 1:07:31.500
And bring some champagne.

1:07:32.791 --> 1:07:33.583
Hi.

1:07:36.916 --> 1:07:37.750
Good evening.

1:07:41.291 --> 1:07:42.083
Hi.

1:08:28.666 --> 1:08:30.750
Hm.

Swipe it, swipe it.

1:08:51.666 --> 1:08:52.583
Hello?

1:08:53.000 --> 1:08:54.791
I'm waiting for you.

1:08:56.541 --> 1:08:58.166
I'm waiting for you too.

1:08:58.458 --> 1:08:59.458
[Brigitte] Strange.

1:09:00.875 --> 1:09:03.875
There's only one table
at this restaurant.

1:09:04.041 --> 1:09:05.208
Where are you exactly?

1:09:06.791 --> 1:09:09.333
I'm afraid we're not in
the same restaurant at all.

1:09:09.416 --> 1:09:11.500
Are you in some private
section of your hotel?

1:09:13.625 --> 1:09:15.791
I will, uh.

1:09:17.500 --> 1:09:18.666
Ask her address.

1:09:19.083 --> 1:09:20.083
What is your address?

1:09:20.875 --> 1:09:22.500
Seven Sunnyside Crescent.

1:09:23.083 --> 1:09:23.916
What's the address here?

1:09:24.291 --> 1:09:24.958
Here?

1:09:25.416 --> 1:09:26.750
25 Saddlebrook.

1:09:27.041 --> 1:09:28.500
Is there somebody
there with you?

1:09:28.791 --> 1:09:31.083
No, no no on, just, just me.

1:09:31.666 --> 1:09:32.500
Tell her to wait.

1:09:33.375 --> 1:09:34.333
You know what, Brigitte?

1:09:34.416 --> 1:09:36.208
This is totally my fault,
I apologize.

1:09:36.291 --> 1:09:36.833
If you could just wait there,

1:09:36.916 --> 1:09:38.333
I will be there as
soon as I can.

1:09:38.750 --> 1:09:40.750
Okay, I'll wait for you.

1:09:41.250 --> 1:09:42.083
Okay, see you soon.

1:09:49.458 --> 1:09:50.625
- I'll-
- Go.

1:10:02.375 --> 1:10:04.041
So, what are you
serving today?

1:10:05.416 --> 1:10:07.958
Uh, chef's menu dégustatif

1:10:08.416 --> 1:10:10.500
Wonderful, any game or bison?

1:10:15.250 --> 1:10:16.666
I will ask the kitchen

1:10:16.750 --> 1:10:18.708
and get back to you
ASAP as possible.

1:10:20.333 --> 1:10:22.083
Oh, would you like an aperitif.

1:10:22.791 --> 1:10:24.833
No, I shouldn't. I'm
heavily medicated.

1:10:27.916 --> 1:10:28.625
Okay.

Hi.

1:11:09.500 --> 1:11:10.416
It's you.

1:11:11.583 --> 1:11:12.458
It's me.

1:11:13.041 --> 1:11:13.833
Over here.

1:11:17.333 --> 1:11:18.125
- Oh.
- It's...

1:11:19.208 --> 1:11:19.833
My date.

1:11:20.458 --> 1:11:21.250
Yeah.

1:11:24.500 --> 1:11:25.458
Your date.

1:11:26.666 --> 1:11:27.750
I should probably...

1:11:28.708 --> 1:11:29.416
It's good to see you.

1:11:30.208 --> 1:11:31.000

1:12:04.875 --> 1:12:05.916
Excellent service.

1:12:08.208 --> 1:12:09.208
You must be a big deal.

1:12:09.291 --> 1:12:11.291
Mm-hmm. [Brigitte chuckles]

1:12:17.041 --> 1:12:17.916
Cheers.

1:12:18.291 --> 1:12:20.041
Cheers everyone.

1:12:26.541 --> 1:12:27.375
Ah.

1:12:27.500 --> 1:12:28.250
It's very good.

1:12:29.333 --> 1:12:30.333
It's very...

1:12:34.958 --> 1:12:35.791
Whoa.

1:12:44.208 --> 1:12:47.625
[upbeat classical valse music]

1:12:52.291 --> 1:12:53.625
Hmm.

1:12:56.250 --> 1:12:57.291
Can you imagine?

1:12:57.916 --> 1:13:00.375
I wanted to take over
and destroy this place.

1:13:00.625 --> 1:13:02.291
I know some people that
can help you with that.

1:13:03.041 --> 1:13:05.208
No, I just feel lonely.

1:13:05.666 --> 1:13:06.583
Find somebody.

1:13:07.500 --> 1:13:09.000
You'll feel less lonely, Diana.

1:13:19.125 --> 1:13:21.791
I'm not stupid or
beautiful enough to do that.

1:13:22.541 --> 1:13:25.000
Because as a woman, you
have to beautiful

1:13:25.083 --> 1:13:26.333
to make a man fall for you.

1:13:27.083 --> 1:13:29.375
Or you have to be stupid
to fall for him back.

1:13:30.041 --> 1:13:33.166
Well Diana, for me, a relationship
is more about trust.

1:13:35.291 --> 1:13:36.166
Would you say that

1:13:37.166 --> 1:13:39.375
brunettes or blondes are
more trustworthy?

1:13:41.000 --> 1:13:41.875
Neither.

1:13:42.291 --> 1:13:46.791
I'd say the most
trustworthy would be balds.

1:13:47.333 --> 1:13:50.958
Well, you're being a
little silly.

1:13:51.541 --> 1:13:53.041
I just feel so down.

1:13:53.666 --> 1:13:55.083
I'm a complete failure.

1:13:55.166 --> 1:13:56.500
Hey hey, listen.

1:13:57.250 --> 1:13:58.250
Hold that thought.

1:13:58.541 --> 1:13:59.625
I have something that
can help you with that.

Come with me.

Hi, can I get two black
Russians, please?

1:14:30.083 --> 1:14:34.500
[crowd murmuring]

1:14:39.125 --> 1:14:41.458
Maybe I was stupid to keep
giving her second chances.

1:14:41.875 --> 1:14:42.583
[Police officer] Yeah.

1:14:44.041 --> 1:14:46.416
Come on, wake up.

1:15:24.333 --> 1:15:27.125
Tell me the taxi driver who
dropped me off, he was right.

1:15:35.750 --> 1:15:36.583
Wow.

1:15:38.458 --> 1:15:40.875
So, I'm persona non grata here.

1:15:46.000 --> 1:15:46.750
Wow.

1:15:47.750 --> 1:15:48.541
Nice.

1:15:49.916 --> 1:15:50.666
There you go.

1:15:53.833 --> 1:15:55.916
Oh, can you tell the
person who has Zakki

1:15:56.041 --> 1:15:57.916
to put the harness strap on him?

1:15:58.375 --> 1:16:00.125
Because he hates the collar.

What am I gonna do with Coco.

1:16:07.541 --> 1:16:10.500

my carry-on. She's small.

1:16:21.625 --> 1:16:22.416
Sorry.

1:16:26.750 --> 1:16:28.375
But Coco's not
even a pit bull.

I can't remember.

You can't remember, or you
don't know, which one is it?

Oh God.

comes anywhere close to you.

1:19:05.458 --> 1:19:06.916
I told you it was him.

Hello, hey, hey.

1:20:31.375 --> 1:20:33.041
Hey, listen to me, I need
to find Diana.

1:20:33.125 --> 1:20:33.750
Do you know where she is?

1:20:34.833 --> 1:20:37.125
Diana's not here, and
her dogs are gone too.

1:20:38.041 --> 1:20:39.875
Yeah, one of them ran away

1:20:39.958 --> 1:20:42.000
and the other one was
taken by a policewoman.

1:20:42.666 --> 1:20:43.208
What?

1:20:43.666 --> 1:20:46.916
Oh, hey, you look much
better with your face on.

1:20:47.375 --> 1:20:49.041
Bradley, is that you?

1:20:49.625 --> 1:20:50.750
Hey, Buddy.

- Bradley.
- Hey.

1:20:53.416 --> 1:20:54.250
Hey, listen to me.

1:20:54.375 --> 1:20:55.916
I gotta find Diana. Do
you know where she went?

1:20:56.666 --> 1:20:57.958
I don't know who Diana is.

1:20:58.291 --> 1:20:59.333
But I know who I am.

1:20:59.958 --> 1:21:01.750
I'm Tom Cook.

1:21:03.500 --> 1:21:05.583
Man, that is great, but
listen, I gotta find Diana.

1:21:05.791 --> 1:21:06.666
Tom, she's the one.

1:21:07.083 --> 1:21:07.916
She's my angel.

1:21:09.000 --> 1:21:10.583
So now we know who saved you.

1:21:11.000 --> 1:21:12.458
And her name is Diana?

1:21:12.666 --> 1:21:14.291
- Yeah.
- [Tom Cook] Aw, great.

1:21:14.708 --> 1:21:16.833
Listen, this place is magic.

1:21:17.000 --> 1:21:18.958
Last night, I ordered
off the menu of the chef.

1:21:19.125 --> 1:21:21.375
And when I tasted the
chef's signature dish,

1:21:21.541 --> 1:21:23.625
suddenly, I
remembered everything.

1:21:23.958 --> 1:21:27.083
About my mission, about the
people that are still living

1:21:27.166 --> 1:21:29.708
off of game hunting and
fishing in the wilderness.

1:21:30.083 --> 1:21:32.208
Maybe you just need to eat
some chips or something

1:21:32.375 --> 1:21:33.500
and all your memories'll
come back to you

1:21:33.583 --> 1:21:34.583
like they came back to me!

1:21:35.208 --> 1:21:36.875
Or you could try the chalet.

1:21:37.000 --> 1:21:38.625
She was staying there
before she came here.

1:21:39.458 --> 1:21:40.541
Yes, yes, thank you.

1:21:40.625 --> 1:21:42.458
And Tom, congratulations,
man, I'm happy for ya.

1:21:43.000 --> 1:21:46.583
By the way, I work
for GeoHunt TV.

1:21:47.208 --> 1:21:48.333
[Tom Cook] I'm the host!

1:21:49.125 --> 1:21:50.166
I'm the host!

1:21:52.125 --> 1:21:52.916
Never heard of it.

1:21:54.375 --> 1:21:56.083
It's a big deal.
It's a big show.

1:22:05.000 --> 1:22:06.708
[sniffling]

1:22:11.833 --> 1:22:13.250
Leave me alone!

1:22:14.958 --> 1:22:16.375
I'm illegal here.

1:22:21.875 --> 1:22:23.125
Diana, please.

1:22:23.666 --> 1:22:24.750
This is crazy.

1:22:25.375 --> 1:22:26.333
Go away.

1:22:29.125 --> 1:22:29.791
Let's talk about this.

1:22:30.000 --> 1:22:30.958
No.

1:22:31.708 --> 1:22:34.541
Look, you're not alone,
okay, I'm here.

1:33:42.041 --> 1:33:44.333
♪ Dance right along ♪

1:33:45.708 --> 1:33:48.625
[song continues]
