01:28.250 --> 01:32.840
Oh, Joanie, that's wonderful,
you just make that look so easy.

01:32.840 --> 01:35.350
Yeah, well, here, Mom--
why don't you try it?

01:35.350 --> 01:37.350
Oh, no, no, dear.

01:37.350 --> 01:39.850
No, I don't want to.
It's not for a mature woman.

01:39.850 --> 01:41.850
Uh-huh. You don't want
to, 'cause you can't.

01:41.850 --> 01:42.850
Can so.
Can not.

01:42.850 --> 01:43.850
Can so.
Can not.

01:43.850 --> 01:45.360
Can so. Give me that.

01:45.360 --> 01:47.860
All right, step back.

01:51.360 --> 01:53.360
(laughing)

01:53.360 --> 01:55.620
Okay, you're laughing
'cause you can't do it.

01:55.620 --> 01:56.700
Can so.
Can not.

01:56.700 --> 01:57.700
Can so.

01:57.700 --> 01:58.870
Look at this.

01:58.870 --> 02:00.450
Your father leaves me
alone for two days

02:00.450 --> 02:01.960
and I become a little kid.

02:01.960 --> 02:03.540
Well, start growing up fast.

02:03.540 --> 02:05.540
I heard Dad pull up
in the driveway.

02:07.000 --> 02:13.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:20.840 --> 02:23.930
I'm glad I talked Dad out of
talking me into going to that.

02:23.930 --> 02:26.180
Well what would you do
at a porcelain convention?

02:26.180 --> 02:27.760
I don't know.

02:27.760 --> 02:31.230
But if I got tired,
I'd always have plenty of
good places to sit down.

02:35.160 --> 02:37.570
(dog barking)

02:40.910 --> 02:42.410
Quick, get me my shotgun.

02:42.410 --> 02:43.910
MARION:
Why? What happened, dear?

02:43.910 --> 02:45.250
There's a wolf in the garage!

02:45.250 --> 02:47.330
That's no wolf, dear.

02:47.330 --> 02:48.840
Were you there?

02:48.840 --> 02:52.340
All I saw was a blur of fangs.

02:52.340 --> 02:54.670
Dad, that's
Fonzie's dog.

02:54.670 --> 02:56.680
Yeah, she probably thought
you were a prowler.

02:56.680 --> 02:58.600
Yeah, he got the dog
for protection.

02:58.600 --> 02:59.680
Protection?

03:00.180 --> 03:01.260
Protection from what?

03:01.260 --> 03:02.800
Girls.

03:09.060 --> 03:10.640
Let me ask you a question.

03:10.640 --> 03:12.610
Who was the turkey
that woke up my dog?

03:14.690 --> 03:17.280
Hey, Mr. C., welcome home.

03:17.280 --> 03:20.400
Well, at least someone
acknowledges my arrival.

03:20.400 --> 03:22.490
Well, it's hard to run
up and hug a man

03:22.490 --> 03:24.490
who comes in yelling
"Wolf, wolf, wolf!"

03:24.490 --> 03:25.990
Go get my suitcase.

03:25.990 --> 03:27.490
Okay, Dad.

03:27.490 --> 03:28.990
Do you think maybe
I should get the shotgun,

03:28.990 --> 03:32.000
just in case there's
another wolf out there?
I'll give you wolves.

03:32.000 --> 03:33.750
Welcome home, dear.

03:33.750 --> 03:36.250
Hey, I want you
to meet my new dog,

03:36.250 --> 03:37.750
Spunky.

03:40.640 --> 03:42.140
Look it...

03:42.140 --> 03:44.840
It's so cute. Wolf.

03:44.840 --> 03:48.930
Well, she looked a lot
bigger in the dark.

03:48.930 --> 03:51.430
Most dogs don't like Howard.

03:51.430 --> 03:53.100
That's not true, Marion.

03:53.100 --> 03:55.180
Oh now, dear, come over here
and sit down and relax.

03:55.180 --> 03:57.690
Joanie, get your
father some milk.

03:57.690 --> 03:58.690
And some Oreo cookies.

03:58.690 --> 03:59.690
Diet thins.

03:59.690 --> 04:01.190
Hey, is this family
not a pip?

04:01.690 --> 04:04.690
Did I not tell you you're going
to have a great time here?

04:04.690 --> 04:06.200
You're a pip, too.

04:06.200 --> 04:09.200
A grown man like you has to have
a dog for protection from girls?

04:09.700 --> 04:12.090
Wait a minute, I don't
think you're getting
the full picture here.

04:12.090 --> 04:15.670
I'm sitting up in my apartment
with, uh, Roberta Ricobini,

04:15.670 --> 04:18.790
having a great time,
if you get my drift.

04:18.790 --> 04:19.880
Loud and clear.

04:19.880 --> 04:21.510
Yeah, when all
of a sudden,

04:21.510 --> 04:23.600
Stacey Lubitsky comes knocking
on my door,

04:24.100 --> 04:26.050
yelling "Surprise! Surprise!"

04:26.050 --> 04:28.520
I'll tell you, we were
really surprised.

04:28.520 --> 04:31.640
There we go, all right.

04:31.640 --> 04:34.020
So that's when he decided
to get the dog, dear.

04:36.190 --> 04:39.060
Well, it is a cute little dog.

04:39.060 --> 04:40.650
(barks, growls)

04:40.650 --> 04:42.450
What did you do to her?

04:42.450 --> 04:45.030
(whispering):
Dogs don't like Howard.

04:45.030 --> 04:48.540
Here's your milk, and
delicious diet thins.

04:48.540 --> 04:50.040
(growling)

04:50.040 --> 04:52.040
Oreos coming up.

04:52.040 --> 04:54.540
Listen, uh, Fonzie...
Yeah?

04:54.540 --> 04:56.410
I'm sorry, but you
can't keep the dog.

04:56.410 --> 04:58.500
Oh, wait a minute, before you
make your final decision...

04:58.500 --> 04:59.500
I just did.

04:59.500 --> 05:02.500
Oh, let me tell you
about her sad, sad life.

05:02.500 --> 05:05.000
I mean, we met at
the pound, didn't we?

05:05.000 --> 05:06.510
That's where they
keep the strays.

05:06.510 --> 05:07.590
Yeah.

05:07.590 --> 05:09.090
And then it was her last day,

05:09.090 --> 05:12.600
and the guards were taking her
down that long, last mile.

05:12.600 --> 05:16.900
Aren't you being just
a little overdramatic?

05:16.900 --> 05:18.990
Oh, no, hey, tell
that to Spunky here.
(whimpering)

05:18.990 --> 05:20.990
You tell her that
she's got to spend

05:20.990 --> 05:23.820
the rest of her life
on the street

05:23.820 --> 05:26.410
with no place
to go, no home.

05:26.410 --> 05:27.910
Look at that face, Mr. C..

05:27.910 --> 05:29.830
Come on, look at that face.
Look at it.

05:33.080 --> 05:35.870
Okay, that's enough,
you can keep the dog.

05:35.870 --> 05:37.950
(all talking)

05:43.010 --> 05:45.600
I've always been a
sucker for hairy faces.

05:45.600 --> 05:48.600
That's not what you said
about Aunt Bessie.

05:53.520 --> 05:56.610
(hammering)

05:57.110 --> 06:00.110
What is all that racket?

06:00.110 --> 06:03.110
Don't tell me you put my bowling
ball in the dryer again.

06:03.110 --> 06:05.110
No, Howard.

06:05.110 --> 06:06.620
The boys are building a fence

06:06.620 --> 06:08.620
so that Spunky can have
her own little yard.

06:08.620 --> 06:09.620
Oh, yeah?

06:09.620 --> 06:11.120
Oh, that's very nice.

06:11.120 --> 06:13.620
That way she won't be
able to attack you again.

06:13.620 --> 06:15.630
She loves me, Marion.

06:15.630 --> 06:19.130
She just thought I was
a prowler, that's all.

06:19.130 --> 06:21.130
Hey, Howie, we're
almost finished.

06:21.130 --> 06:23.130
You got any more wood?

06:23.130 --> 06:25.130
You're using my wood?

06:25.130 --> 06:26.640
Yeah.

06:26.640 --> 06:29.140
Why are they using
my wood, Marion?

06:29.140 --> 06:30.760
Well, now I knew
you wouldn't mind.

06:30.760 --> 06:32.340
But I do mind.

06:32.340 --> 06:33.840
I was saving that
wood to make

06:33.840 --> 06:35.340
a work bench
for myself.

06:35.340 --> 06:36.680
It's very expensive.

06:36.680 --> 06:38.980
Yeah, Fonzie insisted
on only the best.

06:38.980 --> 06:41.570
Fonzie? The next
thing you know,

06:41.570 --> 06:43.490
he's going to want
wall-to-wall carpeting.

06:43.490 --> 06:44.690
Hey, you got some?

06:44.690 --> 06:46.270
I'll give you some.

06:46.270 --> 06:47.770
He's a little out of sorts.

06:47.770 --> 06:48.780
See you, Howie.

06:51.280 --> 06:53.910
Now, Howard, you, you
didn't lose your wood.

06:53.910 --> 06:57.580
It's still in the
yard. Technically.

06:57.580 --> 07:00.170
I hope there's some
left over, sweetheart,

07:00.170 --> 07:03.170
because I want to build you
a beautiful chair,

07:03.170 --> 07:04.010
so you can sit on it.

07:08.130 --> 07:09.600
(whistles)

07:10.100 --> 07:13.100
Spunky.
Here Spunky, Spunky.

07:13.100 --> 07:14.100
Is she here?

07:14.100 --> 07:15.600
No.

07:15.600 --> 07:17.100
Well, where could she be?

07:17.100 --> 07:18.600
She's not outside.

07:18.600 --> 07:21.110
Well, she's new in town.

07:21.110 --> 07:23.610
Probably checking out
the local fire hydrants.

07:23.610 --> 07:25.610
Are you crazy?

07:25.610 --> 07:27.360
Why? Richie always
gets us soda.

07:27.360 --> 07:29.450
I'm not talking sodas.

07:29.450 --> 07:30.950
We just lost Fonzie's dog.

07:31.450 --> 07:32.450
Is he going to hurt us?

07:32.450 --> 07:33.950
Hurt us?

07:33.950 --> 07:35.960
You want to know what he's
going to do to our heads?

07:36.460 --> 07:37.960
(bottle cap pops)

07:37.960 --> 07:40.960
It's going to hurt.

07:40.960 --> 07:42.160
You got it.

07:42.160 --> 07:43.250
Hi, guys.

07:43.250 --> 07:44.250
Oh...
Oh...

07:44.250 --> 07:45.250
It's only Rich.

07:45.250 --> 07:46.750
Oh, you did a great
job on the fence.

07:46.750 --> 07:48.250
Yeah, thanks a lot.

07:48.250 --> 07:51.050
You kind of messed up
the counter, though.
Sorry.

07:51.050 --> 07:52.140
Hey, have you seen
Spunky around?

07:52.140 --> 07:54.140
She doesn't seem to be
in the back yard there.

07:54.140 --> 07:56.230
Uh, Ralph left the ga...

07:56.230 --> 08:01.230
You mean uh, you mean
Spun... Fonzie's dog, Spunky?
Yeah.

08:01.230 --> 08:04.100
I don't know, Rich, I guess,
she's probably with Fonzie.

08:04.100 --> 08:07.690
I mean, it's Fonzie's dog.
She must be with Fonzie.

08:07.690 --> 08:09.690
(screams)

08:12.830 --> 08:13.830
Heyyy?

08:15.700 --> 08:17.200
"Heyyy?"

08:17.200 --> 08:18.610
Oh.

08:18.610 --> 08:22.790
I know your yelp, Malph.
What's wrong?

08:22.790 --> 08:26.340
All right, Fonz, I'm just
going to tell you right out.

08:26.340 --> 08:27.960
I can't take it anymore.

08:27.960 --> 08:30.540
Uh, I'm going to tell
you the truth,

08:30.540 --> 08:31.540
regardless of the
consequences, okay?

08:31.540 --> 08:32.960
Spit it out, Ralph.

08:32.960 --> 08:35.380
Somebody stole your dog.

08:42.390 --> 08:45.980
So I'm not Abe Lincoln.

08:45.980 --> 08:50.310
♪ Are you lonesome tonight? ♪

08:50.310 --> 08:52.400
It's no good, Fonzie.

08:52.400 --> 08:55.400
The FBI won't put out an all
points bulletin on a dog.

08:55.900 --> 08:58.040
Well, we've got
to do something.

08:58.040 --> 09:01.120
Well, take it easy, Fonz.

09:01.120 --> 09:02.630
You don't understand.

09:02.630 --> 09:04.130
This is a Fonzarelli dog.

09:04.130 --> 09:07.130
When a Fonzarelli's in
trouble, I do something.

09:07.130 --> 09:09.630
Well, I'll keep trying.

09:13.140 --> 09:15.140
All right, Spunky, we know
you're out there.

09:15.140 --> 09:16.640
Come out with your paws up!

09:19.010 --> 09:21.060
All right, you're next.

09:21.060 --> 09:22.650
Look at this picture
very very carefully.

09:22.650 --> 09:25.150
Tell me, have you ever
seen this dog?

09:25.150 --> 09:26.980
Well, let's see...

09:26.980 --> 09:29.570
No, not really.

09:29.570 --> 09:32.570
Well, maybe I have
seen her.

09:33.070 --> 09:35.020
Well, no, I'm not too sure...

09:35.020 --> 09:37.160
Have you seen
the dog or not?

09:37.160 --> 09:39.250
Well, it's hard to tell
with that particular picture.

09:39.250 --> 09:41.250
Have you seen this dog?

09:41.250 --> 09:42.750
Fonz, can I talk
to you for a minute?

09:42.750 --> 09:45.250
Yeah?

09:47.250 --> 09:50.260
I think you better
just relax for a while, Fonz,

09:50.260 --> 09:51.790
because uh, well, look,

09:51.790 --> 09:55.880
it is kind of hard to tell
with this particular drawing.

10:00.630 --> 10:03.440
If you look at it from
a distance, you know.

10:03.440 --> 10:04.520
But don't worry, Fonz,

10:04.520 --> 10:07.520
'cause everybody's out
looking for Spunky.

10:07.520 --> 10:10.030
We've done everything we can,
we've called around...

10:10.030 --> 10:11.810
We even put an ad
in the newspapers.

10:11.810 --> 10:12.900
Oh, yeah?

10:12.900 --> 10:15.900
Crooks don't answer ads, Rich.

10:17.030 --> 10:18.620
Okay Fonz,
your worries are over.

10:18.620 --> 10:22.120
Ralph comes through again.

10:22.120 --> 10:23.620
What's he doing
with that dog?

10:23.620 --> 10:25.120
What are you doing
with that dog?

10:25.120 --> 10:26.130
Does that look
like Spunky?

10:26.130 --> 10:28.130
Does that look
like this picture?

10:28.130 --> 10:30.130
(cackling)

10:30.130 --> 10:33.080
That's really funny,
you're kidding.

10:33.080 --> 10:34.470
Who drew that picture?

10:34.470 --> 10:36.050
I did.

10:36.050 --> 10:38.550
Good one, Fonz,
nice detail.

10:38.550 --> 10:41.420
The legs and the tail...

10:41.420 --> 10:43.810
Ralph, where did you
come up with this dog?

10:43.810 --> 10:46.760
Well, I just used
the old Malph charm.

11:01.110 --> 11:04.280
So much for the
old Malph charm.

11:04.280 --> 11:05.360
I didn't know it
was her dog.

11:05.360 --> 11:07.370
It was standing in front
of the supermarket.

11:07.370 --> 11:09.590
It could have been
waiting for a bus.

11:09.590 --> 11:10.670
Hey, look Fonz,
don't you worry,

11:10.670 --> 11:12.510
we're going to find
Spunky for you.

11:12.510 --> 11:14.590
What are you talking about?

11:14.590 --> 11:17.680
I mean, whoever took that dog
could be anywhere by now.

11:17.680 --> 11:18.760
Yeah.

11:18.760 --> 11:20.760
I hear they take them
to Mexico and paint them.

11:29.390 --> 11:30.390
That's cars.

11:30.390 --> 11:31.390
Oh.

11:33.860 --> 11:39.370
Now, Fonz, what makes you think
that Spunky was really stolen?

11:39.370 --> 11:41.870
'Cause Ralph never actually
saw anybody take her.

11:41.870 --> 11:43.370
Look, let me... look...

11:43.370 --> 11:44.870
Ralph, Potsie, did you
open up that gate

11:44.870 --> 11:47.370
and let that dog walk out?
Huh, would you do that?

11:47.370 --> 11:49.380
No.
No.

11:49.380 --> 11:50.880
We wouldn't
do that.

11:50.880 --> 11:51.880
All right then,
somebody walked up,

11:51.880 --> 11:54.380
bent over, picked up my dog,
and took him away.

11:54.380 --> 11:55.880
I call that stolen.
I call that stolen.

11:55.880 --> 11:57.880
Stolen. Absolutely.
Right, Fonz.

11:57.880 --> 11:59.390
Spunky was stolen,
but don't worry,

11:59.390 --> 12:00.890
we're going to find
Spunky, right, Ralph?
Right.

12:00.890 --> 12:02.890
Don't worry, Fonz,
we're going to find Spunky.

12:02.890 --> 12:04.390
Can we borrow the drawing?

12:04.390 --> 12:06.890
We don't need the
drawing, come on.

12:06.890 --> 12:08.980
Pots, did you
see that drawing?

12:08.980 --> 12:13.070
I really wouldn't worry
too much, Fonz,

12:13.070 --> 12:16.570
'cause dogs are capable of doing
some incredible things.

12:16.570 --> 12:18.570
Like, uh, I saw
this war movie one time,

12:18.570 --> 12:20.940
where Lassie got separated
from her master.

12:20.940 --> 12:22.360
Did she find her way home?

12:22.360 --> 12:25.440
Well, uh, actually
I couldn't tell you that.

12:25.440 --> 12:27.450
You see, I saw the movie
at a drive-in

12:27.450 --> 12:30.000
with uh, Carol Kleinsmidth.

12:30.000 --> 12:33.590
Well, yeah, but I'm sure
that Lassie got home.

12:33.590 --> 12:38.090
I mean, look, she's made a lot
of pictures since then, right?

12:38.090 --> 12:42.040
Well I couldn't help it,
Carol was blowing in my ear.
Thanks, Rich, thanks.

12:42.040 --> 12:45.100
When I find the guy
that took my dog...

12:45.630 --> 12:48.130
("You Ain't Nothin'
But a Hound Dog" plays)

12:50.140 --> 12:51.640
(music stops)

13:08.070 --> 13:10.570
I knew you'd be bad
for business.

13:10.570 --> 13:12.070
This was your idea.

13:12.070 --> 13:14.040
Well, they weren't
eating anyway.

13:14.040 --> 13:17.080
Hey, Fonzie, Officer Porter
wants to help you.

13:17.580 --> 13:19.080
He's a police artist.

13:19.080 --> 13:21.080
Figured I'd draw
a sketch of Spunky

13:21.080 --> 13:22.080
and spread it
around the force.

13:22.080 --> 13:23.090
Well, that's great.

13:23.090 --> 13:24.590
I already did that
right here.

13:29.180 --> 13:31.480
You lost a matchstick dog?

13:35.230 --> 13:36.730
It's a rare breed.

13:36.730 --> 13:38.070
It's a fox terrier.

13:38.070 --> 13:39.150
You see, it's all fuzzy,

13:39.150 --> 13:42.150
and it's a smart dog,
eats only Arnold burgers.

13:42.150 --> 13:44.160
Hey, it's my dog,
I'll describe her.

13:44.160 --> 13:46.160
She is about one-six,

13:46.660 --> 13:50.660
and she's about, uh,
hairy, and female.

13:50.660 --> 13:52.160
Yeah?

13:52.160 --> 13:54.670
And she looks like
this right here.

13:54.670 --> 13:56.500
Look at that, she's
got droopy cheeks.

13:56.500 --> 13:59.510
Yeah.
You know?

13:59.510 --> 14:02.090
And, and, and, she's
got, uh, sad eyes.

14:02.090 --> 14:03.590
Sad eyes, yeah.

14:07.100 --> 14:09.600
I think that does it.

14:09.600 --> 14:11.130
How's that?

14:24.730 --> 14:27.320
Well, Fonz,
everybody's out looking.

14:27.320 --> 14:29.320
You might as well
go on home.

14:29.320 --> 14:30.320
If anybody finds Spunky,

14:30.320 --> 14:31.570
they're going
to call you there.

14:31.570 --> 14:35.120
I can't go home
to an empty house, Rich.

14:37.540 --> 14:41.830
Fonz, you could always get
some female companionship.

14:41.830 --> 14:43.920
It won't be the same.
I mean...

14:43.920 --> 14:46.420
they're not going to hop
up and down when I come home.

14:46.420 --> 14:48.970
They're not going
to jump in my arms.

14:48.970 --> 14:52.170
Roberta Ricobini will.

14:52.170 --> 14:55.680
She's not furry, Rich.

14:57.100 --> 14:58.600
There he is.

14:58.600 --> 15:00.100
We have to tell
him, Malph.
No, we don't.

15:00.570 --> 15:01.100
We have to.

15:01.600 --> 15:02.100
No, we don't.

15:02.600 --> 15:03.600
We have to.
No, we don't!

15:03.600 --> 15:04.600
We have to.
We're not gonna...

15:04.600 --> 15:06.110
What are you two
babbling about?

15:06.110 --> 15:09.110
Look at this,
Frick and Frack.

15:09.110 --> 15:11.110
Hey, Rich, Fonz.

15:11.110 --> 15:12.610
Ralph here has
something to tell you.

15:12.610 --> 15:14.110
You tell him.
You tell him.

15:14.110 --> 15:15.610
You tell him.
All right,
hold it.
You tell him.

15:15.610 --> 15:17.120
That's enough.
You tell him.

15:17.120 --> 15:19.120
You tell him.
I'm not playing
this game.

15:19.120 --> 15:21.120
Malph, you're going
to tell me.

15:21.120 --> 15:22.120
All right, Fonz.

15:22.120 --> 15:24.120
It's about your dog.

15:24.120 --> 15:25.120
Here's your dog.

15:25.620 --> 15:26.630
There's my dog.
Here's the dog!

15:26.630 --> 15:29.130
The dog!
(cheering)

15:34.130 --> 15:35.630
Now, listen, Spunk,

15:35.630 --> 15:37.270
maybe this taught you
something, huh?

15:37.270 --> 15:39.360
Like you don't listen
to strangers.

15:39.360 --> 15:41.360
Especially humans, you know?

15:41.360 --> 15:44.190
All right, it's so good
to see you.

15:46.450 --> 15:48.030
All right, listen,
I'll tell you something,

15:48.030 --> 15:49.530
I owe you one, Officer.

15:50.030 --> 15:53.040
Oh, that's okay, I'm a sucker
for happy endings.

15:53.040 --> 15:55.540
Hey, Officer, you catch
the guy who stole Spunky?

15:55.540 --> 15:57.370
Potsie,
nobody stole Spunky.

16:02.630 --> 16:03.630
They heard.

16:03.630 --> 16:05.080
Uh, well, it's obvious,

16:05.080 --> 16:07.130
I mean, Spunky
walked in by himself.

16:07.130 --> 16:08.630
There's no crook
attached to him, right?

16:08.630 --> 16:09.920
Wrong.

16:09.920 --> 16:11.500
I have him in the car.

16:11.500 --> 16:13.010
Good.
Good work, Officer.

16:13.010 --> 16:15.010
Officer Porter,
bring in the culprit.

16:15.010 --> 16:16.010
Malph!

16:16.010 --> 16:17.010
I'll go get him.

16:17.010 --> 16:18.390
He's been giving us
a rough time.

16:20.600 --> 16:23.270
Fonz, now, you're just going
to talk to this guy, right?
Oh, that's right.

16:23.270 --> 16:24.850
That's right, I'm just going
to talk to him.

16:24.850 --> 16:27.570
I'm going to have a convo
with him with my fist.

16:27.570 --> 16:28.650
We've got to
talk, Malph.
No, no.

16:28.650 --> 16:29.860
We've got to
talk, Malph.

16:29.860 --> 16:31.940
Stand up,
I want to warm up.

16:31.940 --> 16:33.440
Put your hands up.

16:34.660 --> 16:36.610
All right, buddy,
in here.

16:36.610 --> 16:38.200
All right now, Fonz,
don't do anything crazy.

16:38.200 --> 16:39.700
Oh, no, I'm not going to do
anything crazy.

16:39.700 --> 16:42.700
I'm just going to turn around,
I'm going to see him.

16:42.700 --> 16:45.200
And, uh...

16:45.200 --> 16:46.120
he's a little kid.

16:46.120 --> 16:47.210
Good guess.

16:47.210 --> 16:48.620
What was your
first clue?

16:48.620 --> 16:52.090
He's a little kid
with a big mouth.

16:52.090 --> 16:53.180
Want me to press charges?

16:53.180 --> 16:56.180
For what,
walking a dog?

16:56.180 --> 16:58.680
Now let me
talk to him, okay?

16:58.680 --> 17:02.270
I'll give you five minutes,
then I have to book him.

17:02.270 --> 17:05.359
All right, all right, now,
uh, just take it easy

17:05.359 --> 17:07.140
'cause you got nothing
to worry about.

17:07.140 --> 17:09.480
You do, if he don't
give me back my dog.

17:09.480 --> 17:10.560
Your dog?

17:10.560 --> 17:12.150
It's my dog,
you stole her.

17:12.150 --> 17:13.369
You crazy, Clyde.

17:13.369 --> 17:16.450
Clyde.
He called me Clyde.

17:16.450 --> 17:19.619
You got a big brother
I can hit?

17:19.619 --> 17:21.210
If you don't
give me back my dog,

17:21.210 --> 17:22.880
you and me are going
to duke it out.

17:22.880 --> 17:25.740
Oh, are you
kidding me, huh?

17:27.079 --> 17:28.410
Fonz, uh,

17:28.410 --> 17:30.580
maybe he's telling
the truth.

17:30.580 --> 17:31.670
You stay out of it.

17:31.670 --> 17:32.920
This is between me

17:32.920 --> 17:34.500
and Clyde.
He called me Clyde again!

17:35.500 --> 17:37.010
You stop
calling me a crook,

17:37.010 --> 17:39.010
or me and you are gonna
really duke it out.

17:39.010 --> 17:40.010
Whoa. Yeah?

17:43.150 --> 17:44.650
Wait, Fonz,
don't hurt him!

17:44.650 --> 17:45.810
Yeah, right, Fonz, come on.

17:45.810 --> 17:46.900
Get out of my way.

17:46.900 --> 17:49.900
Golly, there are more
white guys in this place

17:49.900 --> 17:52.400
than there are
in my whole school.

17:52.400 --> 17:54.410
Fonz, I got to
tell you the truth.

17:54.410 --> 17:55.410
He didn't steal Spunky.

17:55.410 --> 17:57.410
You see, she got loose
and ran out of the yard.

17:57.410 --> 18:00.410
It was Potsie's fault.

18:00.410 --> 18:02.830
You opened the gate,
it wasn't my fault.

18:02.830 --> 18:04.250
Why do you always
blame me?
Cool it!

18:06.290 --> 18:09.840
Are you telling me that you
let my dog out of the yard?

18:09.840 --> 18:11.540
Fonz, it was an accident.
It was an accident.

18:11.540 --> 18:13.130
I don't care
about accidents,

18:13.130 --> 18:15.130
I care about
you lied to me.

18:16.600 --> 18:18.180
(whimpers)

18:21.350 --> 18:23.440
Oh, good,
he hit Potsie.

18:27.310 --> 18:28.810
All right, both of you,
in my office.

18:28.810 --> 18:29.810
Yeah, right.
Right, Fonz.

18:29.810 --> 18:30.810
In my office.
Okay.

18:30.810 --> 18:31.810
You stay where you are,

18:31.810 --> 18:33.310
'cause I got to talk to you.

18:33.810 --> 18:35.810
I've got to go think this out,
I'll be right back.
Right, Fonz.

18:39.320 --> 18:40.790
Get in there.
In here?

18:40.790 --> 18:43.160
Get in there.
Get in there.
Fonz, that's the ladies room.

18:43.160 --> 18:44.710
Uh, we're coming in!

18:44.710 --> 18:47.410
Ready or not, here we are.

18:47.410 --> 18:50.000
Hey, there's something
missing in here.

18:55.330 --> 18:56.640
What was your name again?

18:56.640 --> 18:58.420
Whitey Ford.

18:58.420 --> 18:59.510
(chuckles)

18:59.510 --> 19:00.890
Yeah, that's a very good one.

19:03.590 --> 19:04.680
I can see why
you'd be upset.

19:04.680 --> 19:07.680
I mean, some policeman
pulls you off the street,

19:07.680 --> 19:09.180
brings you in here, but...

19:09.180 --> 19:12.180
but you got nothing
at all to be scared of.

19:12.180 --> 19:13.690
Scared?

19:13.690 --> 19:15.020
I'm not scared
of nothing.

19:17.360 --> 19:21.360
Huh, huh, huh, huh,
no, not scared.

19:21.360 --> 19:23.360
I didn't mean scared.

19:23.360 --> 19:24.700
(clears throat):
Good punch.

19:24.700 --> 19:26.370
You're lucky I held back.

19:26.370 --> 19:27.750
Oh, yeah, yeah,
well, I feel lucky.

19:29.500 --> 19:31.090
Why don't you smile or
something, you know?

19:31.090 --> 19:33.590
You're going to be out of
here in no time at all.

19:33.590 --> 19:35.090
30 seconds.

19:35.090 --> 19:38.090
You've got that long
to get out of my way.

19:38.090 --> 19:39.260
Oh.

19:39.260 --> 19:41.130
You really like
that dog, don't you?

19:43.100 --> 19:44.180
I'm not getting
any answers here.

19:44.180 --> 19:45.430
You really like
that dog, don't you?

19:47.190 --> 19:49.690
"What's it to
you, Clyde?"

19:51.390 --> 19:52.440
Oops, you almost
smiled, I saw you.

19:52.980 --> 19:54.980
15 seconds.

19:54.980 --> 19:57.980
You got any brothers
or sisters?

19:57.980 --> 19:59.980
"You taking a census?"

20:00.980 --> 20:02.990
All right,
I got you that time.

20:02.990 --> 20:04.490
Okay, okay.

20:04.490 --> 20:05.990
I hope I didn't
hurt you.

20:05.990 --> 20:06.990
Aw, forget it.

20:06.990 --> 20:09.880
Well, you might have
hurt a lesser man.

20:11.210 --> 20:12.740
(high-pitched sigh)

20:15.250 --> 20:16.250
I feel better.

20:16.250 --> 20:17.750
I feel better.

20:17.750 --> 20:19.750
I understand
you didn't steal my dog.

20:19.750 --> 20:20.890
I understand that.

20:20.890 --> 20:22.840
I know it, too.

20:24.720 --> 20:26.680
He's a cute
little kid, huh?

20:26.680 --> 20:28.840
You're lucky he's
even answering you.

20:28.840 --> 20:30.900
Listen, would you do
me a favor,

20:30.900 --> 20:31.980
go out there
and tell the officer

20:31.980 --> 20:33.980
I'm not going to press
any charges, all right?

20:34.480 --> 20:36.400
Yeah, sure.

20:36.400 --> 20:38.990
Oh, Fonz, watch out
for this kid's right,

20:38.990 --> 20:39.990
you know
what I mean?

20:39.990 --> 20:41.990
Yeah, yeah.

20:41.990 --> 20:43.490
He's a funny guy.

20:43.490 --> 20:46.500
He's hysterical,
he's hysterical.

20:46.500 --> 20:48.000
Uh, listen, kid...

20:48.000 --> 20:49.450
uh, no, no, no, no fists,

20:49.450 --> 20:50.500
no fists, come on.

20:50.500 --> 20:52.500
Put 'em down... down.

20:52.500 --> 20:54.000
Ooh... good.

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
Uh, why don't you
sit down?

20:56.000 --> 20:57.010
I don't think
I want to.

20:57.010 --> 20:58.010
Sit down.

20:58.510 --> 20:59.510
Well, maybe just
for a minute.

21:01.010 --> 21:03.010
Yeah, right.
Now, uh...

21:03.010 --> 21:06.520
listen, kid,
I really understand

21:06.520 --> 21:08.520
that you didn't steal
my dog, you know?

21:08.520 --> 21:10.020
But the thing is that
you should have...

21:10.020 --> 21:11.690
you should have
looked for her owner.

21:11.690 --> 21:13.270
Well, she had no name tag.

21:13.270 --> 21:14.770
And she didn't know
her phone number.

21:14.770 --> 21:16.140
It's unlisted.

21:16.140 --> 21:19.440
It's unlisted, that's why.

21:19.440 --> 21:20.980
Okay, uh...

21:20.980 --> 21:22.450
the thing is that...

21:26.200 --> 21:27.790
I really appreciate

21:27.790 --> 21:30.790
that you took good care
of her, you understand...

21:30.790 --> 21:34.290
and, uh--

21:34.290 --> 21:36.460
Do you want to
save me just a few?

21:36.460 --> 21:39.000
Go ahead,
help yourself.

21:40.470 --> 21:42.470
I appreciate you,
you know?

21:42.470 --> 21:44.390
You really like dogs,
don't you?

21:44.390 --> 21:45.470
You know it, Clyde.

21:45.470 --> 21:47.060
(dog barks)

21:48.060 --> 21:50.060
Hey, Spunky, come here.

21:50.560 --> 21:53.230
Come here, Spunky,
hello, yeah.

21:53.230 --> 21:54.810
Spunky?

21:54.810 --> 21:55.930
She really is your dog.

21:55.930 --> 21:56.850
Yeah.

21:56.850 --> 21:59.400
Fonz?

21:59.400 --> 22:01.570
Are you going
to let him keep Spunky?

22:01.570 --> 22:02.650
Are you crazy?

22:02.650 --> 22:03.660
It's his dog.

22:03.660 --> 22:05.410
You don't give away
your own dog.

22:05.410 --> 22:07.990
That's right, but the thing is,
I really appreciate you

22:07.990 --> 22:09.490
and I'm going to tell
what I'm going to do, all right?

22:09.490 --> 22:11.000
You're going to meet me here
tomorrow morning,

22:11.000 --> 22:13.500
I'm going to get you
your own dog, all right?

22:13.500 --> 22:14.250
Just one thing.

22:15.530 --> 22:18.540
I can't live with
the name Clyde.

22:20.040 --> 22:22.460
Coolamundo?
Coolamundo.

22:22.460 --> 22:25.430
Not you.

22:25.430 --> 22:26.600
Coolamundo.

22:26.600 --> 22:28.960
(barks)

22:30.380 --> 22:31.970
Let's go home.
I agree with you.

22:32.470 --> 22:33.970
All right.

22:42.940 --> 22:44.450
He's gone.
What should we do?

22:44.450 --> 22:45.450
I don't know.

22:45.450 --> 22:46.950
Fonzie didn't say
we could leave.

22:46.950 --> 22:48.450
We better stay in here.
Yeah.

22:52.870 --> 22:53.710
Hey, you guys!

22:55.790 --> 22:57.160
You gonna spend
the weekend in there?

22:57.160 --> 22:58.790
You going to hit us, Fonz?

22:58.790 --> 23:00.300
You going to lie to me again?

23:00.300 --> 23:01.050
Never again, Fonz.

23:01.050 --> 23:02.130
Promise.
Get out of here.

23:02.130 --> 23:03.630
Thanks.
Hey.

23:03.630 --> 23:04.670
Hey, Fonz,

23:04.670 --> 23:06.250
girls write on the
bathroom wall, too.

23:06.250 --> 23:08.750
Yeah, they have a whole
wall dedicated to you.

23:10.090 --> 23:11.170
One wall?

23:11.170 --> 23:12.890
Heyyy.

23:12.890 --> 23:15.980
Come here, come here.

23:15.980 --> 23:17.730
Come here, yeah.
Listen to me.

23:17.730 --> 23:20.320
I don't want you to run away
from home again, you know why?

23:20.320 --> 23:21.820
You know why?

23:21.820 --> 23:23.650
Because I love you, that's why.

23:38.030 --> 23:39.530
Hey, Rich, let me
tell you something.
Hi, Fonz.

23:39.530 --> 23:42.540
I taught my dog a new
trick you can't believe it.

23:42.540 --> 23:44.510
Oh, yeah?
Where is my dog?

23:44.510 --> 23:46.090
Oh, oh, don't worry.

23:46.090 --> 23:47.790
Dad's taking her out
for a walk, that's all.
All right.

23:47.790 --> 23:49.380
Come on, Spunk.

23:50.880 --> 23:53.380
I, uh, I thought you
didn't like her.

23:53.880 --> 23:57.020
Well, that's
a vicious rumor.

23:57.020 --> 23:59.100
Anyway, anyway,
I got this trick, see.
Yeah?

23:59.100 --> 24:01.110
I'm in my apartment
with a chick, right?
Right.

24:01.110 --> 24:03.610
Okay, and then
it's nice and cozy,

24:03.610 --> 24:06.980
and then there's the sound
of a kiss, you know?
Yeah.

24:09.900 --> 24:12.400
That's all right,
you won't embarrass me,

24:12.400 --> 24:13.540
I'm one of the boys.

24:13.540 --> 24:14.620
All right.

24:14.620 --> 24:15.620
This is the greatest
trick, Mr. C.

24:15.620 --> 24:18.120
Arthur, you taught
Spunky a trick?

24:18.120 --> 24:20.160
That's nice,
may we see it?

24:20.160 --> 24:21.740
Uh, well, actually,
the thing is that

24:21.740 --> 24:23.250
I need a little more
practice, you know?

24:23.250 --> 24:24.250
Oh, yes, I understand.

24:24.250 --> 24:28.220
Arthur, I'm just so glad
that you got your dog back.

24:28.220 --> 24:29.300
(lip smack)

24:43.980 --> 24:45.900
What a trick!

24:45.900 --> 24:47.850
Well, I've got to go take her
for a walk again, you know?

24:49.910 --> 24:52.990
Come on, come on, here we go,
jump right here, right here.
