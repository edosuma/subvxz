Hey, look at this,

07:13.850 --> 07:15.977
I got you, uh..

07:16.019 --> 07:17.145
Wait till you see this.

07:17.187 --> 07:19.564
Chocolate Badgers instead, huh?

07:21.191 --> 07:25.028
Instead?

07:21.191 --> 07:25.028
Jess, there is no instead.

07:25.070 --> 07:27.864
Vanilla Weasels are

07:25.070 --> 07:27.864
more than just a cookie.

07:27.906 --> 07:29.908
They're-they're a lifetime

07:27.906 --> 07:29.908
of memories for me.

07:29.950 --> 07:31.410
Well..

07:31.451 --> 07:34.704
- You know, when I was a kid.

07:31.451 --> 07:34.704
- Yeah.

07:34.746 --> 07:36.539
My mom would

07:34.746 --> 07:36.539
tuck me in bed

07:36.581 --> 07:37.291
mm-hmm.

07:37.332 --> 07:39.542
give me a weasel

07:39.584 --> 07:42.087
and sing me the score

07:39.584 --> 07:42.087
to "South Pacific."

07:43.755 --> 07:46.174
Boy, those were some

07:43.755 --> 07:46.174
enchanted evenings, Jess.

07:46.216 --> 07:47.508
Yeah.

07:47.550 --> 07:49.010
[exhales sharply]

07:49.052 --> 07:51.846
Suddenly, it's starting

07:49.052 --> 07:51.846
to all make sense, Joe.

07:53.723 --> 07:55.350
Hey, everybody,

07:53.723 --> 07:55.350
guess what?

07:55.392 --> 07:57.185
Yeah, we know,

07:55.392 --> 07:57.185
there's no weasels.

07:57.227 --> 07:58.979
No, Aunt Becky is

07:57.227 --> 07:58.979
the new producer

07:59.020 --> 08:01.564
of "Wake Up San Francisco."

08:01.606 --> 08:03.524
(D.J.)

08:01.606 --> 08:03.524
'Wow. Congratulations.'

08:03.566 --> 08:05.110
(Jesse)

08:03.566 --> 08:05.110
'Hey, congratulations.'

08:05.152 --> 08:06.945
I couldn't believe it

08:05.152 --> 08:06.945
when Mr. Strowbridge told me.

08:06.987 --> 08:08.905
I mean, Danny deserves

08:06.987 --> 08:08.905
the job much as I do.

08:08.947 --> 08:10.240
I don't know

08:08.947 --> 08:10.240
why he picked me.

08:10.282 --> 08:12.993
Oh, don't be so modest,

08:10.282 --> 08:12.993
Miss Producer.

08:13.034 --> 08:14.995
I think it's great.

08:13.034 --> 08:14.995
I couldn't be happier for you.

08:15.036 --> 08:17.456
Hey, you know what, I'm

08:15.036 --> 08:17.456
going to take everyone out

08:15.036 --> 08:17.456
for dinner tomorrow night.

08:17.497 --> 08:18.790
- Great.

08:17.497 --> 08:18.790
- Alright, sounds good.

08:18.832 --> 08:20.625
Hey. It's a

08:18.832 --> 08:20.625
Tanner family convention.

08:20.667 --> 08:22.377
Aunt Becky's just

08:20.667 --> 08:22.377
been made new producer

08:22.419 --> 08:24.379
of "Wake Up San Francisco."

08:24.421 --> 08:26.256
Wow! What a burn.

08:29.550 --> 08:32.429
[sighs]

08:29.550 --> 08:32.429
Mr. T working

08:29.550 --> 08:32.429
for Mrs. Hairboy.

08:34.555 --> 08:36.433
You've been doing that

08:34.555 --> 08:36.433
show longer than she has

08:36.475 --> 08:39.060
and they just

08:36.475 --> 08:39.060
passed you by.

08:39.102 --> 08:43.815
Bam! Big, tall string bean

08:39.102 --> 08:43.815
left standing out in the dust.

08:43.857 --> 08:46.985
Boy, this must be gnawing

08:43.857 --> 08:46.985
at you like a starving rat

08:47.027 --> 08:48.320
in a Cheeto factory.

08:50.030 --> 08:51.698
Kimmy, you couldn't

08:50.030 --> 08:51.698
be more off.

08:51.739 --> 08:54.201
I am very

08:51.739 --> 08:54.201
happy for Rebecca.

08:54.242 --> 08:57.871
[chuckles]

08:54.242 --> 08:57.871
I feel proud.

08:54.242 --> 08:57.871
I-I feel great.

08:57.912 --> 08:59.706
(Jesse)

08:57.912 --> 08:59.706
'Where do you guys

08:57.912 --> 08:59.706
want to eat tomorrow?'

09:01.916 --> 09:05.212
Feel like a big, tall string

09:01.916 --> 09:05.212
bean left standing in the dust.

09:10.300 --> 09:11.259
[instrumental music]

09:13.928 --> 09:16.056
- Hey.

09:13.928 --> 09:16.056
- Hey, Danny, how's it going?

09:16.097 --> 09:18.683
I couldn't be

09:16.097 --> 09:18.683
bitter, better.

09:18.725 --> 09:20.352
Good, well, why don't

09:18.725 --> 09:20.352
we go over our schedule

09:20.394 --> 09:21.436
for next week's shows?

09:21.478 --> 09:22.896
- Okay.

09:22.937 --> 09:24.731
Now, we have

09:22.937 --> 09:24.731
a problem on Thursday.

09:24.772 --> 09:27.401
Alfie,

09:24.772 --> 09:27.401
the talking seal canceled.

09:27.442 --> 09:32.030
- Laryngitis?

09:27.442 --> 09:32.030
- Lettermen.

09:32.072 --> 09:33.823
Oh, well, since Alfie's out,

09:32.072 --> 09:33.823
why don't we go back

09:33.865 --> 09:36.326
to my "Welcome Back, Kotter"

09:33.865 --> 09:36.326
reunion idea?

09:36.368 --> 09:37.952
- Oh, I don't know, Danny.

09:36.368 --> 09:37.952
- Oh, come on.

09:37.994 --> 09:40.247
It was your classic

09:37.994 --> 09:40.247
All-American high school Sitcom.

09:40.288 --> 09:42.957
Remember Horshack?

09:40.288 --> 09:42.957
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!

09:42.999 --> 09:46.753
Or Washington?

09:42.999 --> 09:46.753
"Mr. Kottair, Mr. Kottair."

09:46.794 --> 09:47.879
Danny, I just don't

09:46.794 --> 09:47.879
think Strowbridge

09:47.921 --> 09:49.256
is gonna go for the idea.

09:49.297 --> 09:50.924
Yeah, but, Becky,

09:49.297 --> 09:50.924
you're the producer now.

09:50.965 --> 09:53.176
You get to make

09:50.965 --> 09:53.176
all the decisions.

09:53.218 --> 09:54.635
You're right.

09:54.677 --> 09:58.432
The truth is,

09:54.677 --> 09:58.432
I don't like the idea.

09:58.473 --> 10:00.016
This morning

09:58.473 --> 10:00.016
you said it was cute.

10:00.058 --> 10:02.018
Well, this morning

10:00.058 --> 10:02.018
I wasn't the producer.

10:02.060 --> 10:03.186
Didn't matter

10:02.060 --> 10:03.186
what I said.

10:04.563 --> 10:06.440
So you were just

10:04.563 --> 10:06.440
patronizing me?

10:06.481 --> 10:09.317
No, no, no, no.

10:06.481 --> 10:09.317
Of course not.

10:09.359 --> 10:11.236
Like you're doing

10:09.359 --> 10:11.236
right now?

10:11.278 --> 10:14.697
Danny, don't take it

10:11.278 --> 10:14.697
personally, okay?

10:14.739 --> 10:16.533
This is my first

10:14.739 --> 10:16.533
shot as producer.

10:16.575 --> 10:18.577
I'm just trying to raise

10:16.575 --> 10:18.577
the level of the show.

10:20.287 --> 10:22.997
Well, excuse me if I've

10:20.287 --> 10:22.997
been dragging it down.

10:23.039 --> 10:25.083
Danny, why are you

10:23.039 --> 10:25.083
acting like this?

10:25.125 --> 10:27.168
Because you've been

10:25.125 --> 10:27.168
shooting down all of my ideas.

10:27.210 --> 10:29.337
I shot down

10:27.210 --> 10:29.337
one dumb idea.

10:29.379 --> 10:30.671
And you know what?

10:30.713 --> 10:33.341
That was my last dumb idea.

10:33.383 --> 10:34.717
You know,

10:33.383 --> 10:34.717
since you've become producer

10:34.759 --> 10:36.677
things have gotten

10:34.759 --> 10:36.677
totally outta control.

10:36.719 --> 10:38.763
I've been producer

10:36.719 --> 10:38.763
for four hours.

10:38.805 --> 10:40.640
Yeah and I've been

10:38.805 --> 10:40.640
quiet long enough.

10:40.681 --> 10:42.934
You haven't

10:40.681 --> 10:42.934
been quiet since I met you.

10:42.976 --> 10:44.352
Oh, yeah?

10:44.394 --> 10:45.812
Well, maybe things

10:44.394 --> 10:45.812
would get nice and quiet

10:45.853 --> 10:47.355
if I weren't around.

10:47.397 --> 10:49.274
What do you mean

10:47.397 --> 10:49.274
if you weren't around?

10:49.316 --> 10:52.693
You know, not around, not there,

10:49.316 --> 10:52.693
absent, lack of presence.

10:52.735 --> 10:54.862
No more Danny Tanner

10:52.735 --> 10:54.862
to kick around anymore.

10:54.904 --> 10:58.074
- You'd quit over Horshack?

10:54.904 --> 10:58.074
- Oh, it's not just Horshack.

10:58.116 --> 11:02.245
No, I'm talking Barbarino,

10:58.116 --> 11:02.245
Epstein, all the Sweathogs.

11:02.287 --> 11:05.706
Danny, I can't believe that you

11:02.287 --> 11:05.706
would put me in this position.

11:05.748 --> 11:08.835
Now, I've got a show to run.

11:08.876 --> 11:12.213
And if you quit...I will

11:08.876 --> 11:12.213
just have to replace you.

11:14.799 --> 11:17.385
Well, then, I do quit.

11:17.427 --> 11:20.013
So you just replace away.

11:20.054 --> 11:22.557
I'll tell you something, you're

11:20.054 --> 11:22.557
in deep water now, Miss Producer

11:22.599 --> 11:25.310
because you'll never find

11:22.599 --> 11:25.310
another Danny Tanner.

11:25.352 --> 11:28.480
I am Mr. Wake Up San Francisco.

11:28.522 --> 11:29.981
Wake up, San Francisco.

11:30.023 --> 11:31.399
I'm Phil Blankman.

11:31.441 --> 11:32.817
Ha-ha.

11:31.441 --> 11:32.817
Ha ha ha ha.

11:34.693 --> 11:36.695
And I'm Rebecca Donaldson.

11:36.737 --> 11:38.114
Welcome to the show, Phil.

11:38.156 --> 11:40.200
I was gonna say that.

11:40.241 --> 11:43.161
[chuckles]

11:40.241 --> 11:43.161
Phil, that only works

11:40.241 --> 11:43.161
if we say that at the same time.

11:43.203 --> 11:44.621
Right.

11:44.663 --> 11:47.832
Well, great to be here,

11:44.663 --> 11:47.832
Beck-arino.

11:51.419 --> 11:55.549
Well, it's great to have

11:51.419 --> 11:55.549
you here, Phil-arino.

11:55.590 --> 11:58.343
And our special guest

11:55.590 --> 11:58.343
today is Janet Reno.

11:58.385 --> 11:59.718
Ha!

11:59.760 --> 12:02.222
The attorney general

11:59.760 --> 12:02.222
of the United States.

12:02.263 --> 12:04.723
She'll be discussing her career,

12:02.263 --> 12:04.723
the new crime bill--

12:04.765 --> 12:07.352
And she's cooking

12:04.765 --> 12:07.352
chowder. Ha-ha.

12:10.188 --> 12:11.398
[chuckles]

12:13.233 --> 12:15.527
So, uh, what do you

12:13.233 --> 12:15.527
think of him?

12:20.448 --> 12:22.825
Well, he's-he's-he's..

12:22.867 --> 12:24.703
- He's perky.

12:22.867 --> 12:24.703
- Perky.

12:24.743 --> 12:26.204
- Yeah.

12:24.743 --> 12:26.204
- Yeah, he's perky.

12:26.246 --> 12:28.873
Remember I only had

12:26.246 --> 12:28.873
one day to find someone.

12:28.915 --> 12:31.292
It was either

12:28.915 --> 12:31.292
Laughing Phil, the weatherman

12:31.334 --> 12:34.795
or Vampire Vic from the

12:31.334 --> 12:34.795
"Midnight Monster" movie.

12:34.837 --> 12:36.130
Phil's a good choice.

12:36.172 --> 12:38.216
Yeah, and he's

12:36.172 --> 12:38.216
easier to kill.

12:39.967 --> 12:42.512
I'll just fast-forward

12:39.967 --> 12:42.512
to this other part.

12:42.554 --> 12:44.723
- Celery?

12:42.554 --> 12:44.723
- Thanks.

12:46.849 --> 12:49.102
[sighs]

12:46.849 --> 12:49.102
What are you

12:46.849 --> 12:49.102
pretending yours is?

12:49.143 --> 12:51.479
- Snickers.

12:49.143 --> 12:51.479
- Dove Bar.

12:51.521 --> 12:52.689
Want to trade?

12:52.731 --> 12:54.857
Oh, yeah.

12:54.899 --> 12:56.150
Beck, don't you

12:54.899 --> 12:56.150
think you and Danny

12:56.192 --> 12:57.736
could just work things out?

12:57.776 --> 13:00.530
Well, I'd love to,

12:57.776 --> 13:00.530
but he's the one who quit.

13:00.572 --> 13:02.115
I think he's just having

13:00.572 --> 13:02.115
trouble accepting me

13:02.156 --> 13:03.450
as an authority figure.

13:03.491 --> 13:05.076
Yeah, but you two

13:03.491 --> 13:05.076
belong together

13:05.118 --> 13:06.869
you know like-like

13:05.118 --> 13:06.869
Laurel and Hardy

13:06.911 --> 13:10.582
like ham and eggs,

13:06.911 --> 13:10.582
like weasels and milk.

13:10.624 --> 13:12.208
Weasels and milk.

13:10.624 --> 13:12.208
My weasels.

13:12.250 --> 13:14.127
I can't believe they're gone.

13:14.168 --> 13:15.794
I've lost the will to snack.

13:18.214 --> 13:19.257
Hold up. Put it on pause.

13:19.299 --> 13:20.508
Hold on, look at this.

13:21.800 --> 13:23.219
(Jesse)

13:21.800 --> 13:23.219
'See that?'

13:24.679 --> 13:27.390
"Produced by Rebecca Donaldson."

13:27.432 --> 13:31.102
I have to admit,

13:27.432 --> 13:31.102
it does have a nice ring to it.

13:31.144 --> 13:33.313
[sighs]

13:31.144 --> 13:33.313
Hey, guys.

13:33.354 --> 13:34.939
- Hi.

13:33.354 --> 13:34.939
- 'Hi.'

13:34.981 --> 13:36.608
What were you watching?

13:36.650 --> 13:39.152
(in unison)

13:36.650 --> 13:39.152
Uh..

13:39.193 --> 13:41.780
You know, we were watching

13:39.193 --> 13:41.780
that-that-that nutty show

13:41.820 --> 13:44.407
"The Frugal Gourmet."

13:44.449 --> 13:46.075
Yeah, this guy's so cheap.

13:44.449 --> 13:46.075
You should've seen.

13:46.117 --> 13:48.869
He was tricking a frog

13:46.117 --> 13:48.869
into a bag of Shake 'n Bake.

13:51.665 --> 13:52.915
Isn't this a coincidence?

13:52.957 --> 13:55.168
Dad's here,

13:52.957 --> 13:55.168
Aunt Becky's here.

13:55.209 --> 13:57.796
Don't you think this

13:55.209 --> 13:57.796
would be a good time

13:55.209 --> 13:57.796
to try work things out?

13:57.836 --> 14:00.839
There-there's nothing

13:57.836 --> 14:00.839
to work out.

14:00.881 --> 14:02.883
I couldn't be happier

14:00.881 --> 14:02.883
with my time off.

14:02.925 --> 14:05.512
I'm getting to do all the things

14:02.925 --> 14:05.512
I've always wanted to do.

14:05.553 --> 14:08.055
See, I, uh, even made

14:05.553 --> 14:08.055
this ship in a bottle.

14:10.099 --> 14:13.770
Actually, it's, uh, more like

14:10.099 --> 14:13.770
a shipwreck in a bottle.

14:13.812 --> 14:16.397
Hey, everybody,

14:13.812 --> 14:16.397
I finished my report.

14:16.439 --> 14:17.940
"What my daddy does."

14:17.982 --> 14:20.485
Except now it's called

14:17.982 --> 14:20.485
"What my daddy did."

14:20.527 --> 14:21.902
Do you wanna hear it?

14:21.944 --> 14:23.904
I'm sorry, but

14:21.944 --> 14:23.904
not right now, honey.

14:23.946 --> 14:27.867
That was the past, and I'm,

14:23.946 --> 14:27.867
uh, looking to the future.

14:27.908 --> 14:30.077
- What do you see?

14:27.908 --> 14:30.077
- A new hobby.

14:31.162 --> 14:32.831
[instrumental music]

14:35.583 --> 14:37.210
Come on, please.

14:35.583 --> 14:37.210
Eat your food, son.

14:38.753 --> 14:40.714
Hey, you guys,

14:38.753 --> 14:40.714
I just wanna say thanks.

14:40.755 --> 14:42.006
It's been

14:40.755 --> 14:42.006
really great celebrating

14:42.048 --> 14:43.174
with the people I love.

14:49.806 --> 14:52.600
Would anyone care for dessert?

14:49.806 --> 14:52.600
Gentlemen?

14:52.642 --> 14:54.477
I want dessert!

14:54.519 --> 14:56.896
Double bessert!

14:56.937 --> 14:58.690
No, no, no, no.

14:56.937 --> 14:58.690
No, boys.

14:58.732 --> 14:59.982
No bessert, no bessert.

15:00.024 --> 15:01.526
Thank you,<i> garcon.</i>

15:01.568 --> 15:04.070
You finish your dinner,

15:01.568 --> 15:04.070
then you can have bessert.

15:04.111 --> 15:05.905
- We want bessert!

15:04.111 --> 15:05.905
- We want dessert!

15:05.946 --> 15:07.948
- We want bessert!

15:05.946 --> 15:07.948
- We want dessert!

15:07.990 --> 15:09.283
- 'We want bessert!'

15:07.990 --> 15:09.283
- 'We want dessert!'

15:09.325 --> 15:11.828
Nicky, Alex,

15:09.325 --> 15:11.828
behave yourselves.

15:11.870 --> 15:13.162
(in unison)

15:11.870 --> 15:13.162
We want bessert!

15:13.204 --> 15:15.164
(in unison)

15:13.204 --> 15:15.164
We want bessert!

15:15.206 --> 15:16.875
(in unison)

15:15.206 --> 15:16.875
We want bessert!

15:16.916 --> 15:19.502
We want bessert!

15:19.544 --> 15:20.670
[chanting continues]

15:20.712 --> 15:22.630
Everybody's staring at us.

15:22.672 --> 15:25.174
Just give them some dessert.

15:25.216 --> 15:27.260
What lesson would

15:25.216 --> 15:27.260
they learn from that?

15:27.301 --> 15:30.221
If you embarrass your

15:27.301 --> 15:30.221
family, you get dessert.

15:30.263 --> 15:32.724
No, no, no.

15:30.263 --> 15:32.724
We're not going to do that.

15:32.766 --> 15:34.475
You know what, I'm gonna

15:32.766 --> 15:34.475
take care of this right now.

15:34.517 --> 15:36.269
And I don't care

15:34.517 --> 15:36.269
what people think.

15:36.310 --> 15:39.272
Alright, okay, alright.

15:39.313 --> 15:41.023
[screaming]

15:43.693 --> 15:44.861
[screaming continues]

15:46.738 --> 15:49.073
What? I'm just doing

15:46.738 --> 15:49.073
a little parenting.

15:49.115 --> 15:50.408
Eat your peas.

15:51.910 --> 15:53.787
Alright, okay. Good. Good.

15:53.828 --> 15:55.413
Here you go. Sit down there.

15:55.455 --> 15:57.624
You guys wanna kick and scream

15:55.455 --> 15:57.624
and have a big tantrum

15:57.665 --> 15:59.083
go ahead, go nuts.

15:59.125 --> 16:01.586
- Right here?

15:59.125 --> 16:01.586
- Oh, yeah. Of course.

16:01.628 --> 16:03.630
You can't do it in there.

16:01.628 --> 16:03.630
That's-that's the dining room.

16:03.671 --> 16:05.423
And here, this is,

16:03.671 --> 16:05.423
well, this is screaming room.

16:05.465 --> 16:06.466
Go ahead, scream.

16:06.507 --> 16:08.342
We wanna go back in there.

16:08.384 --> 16:10.595
Okay, fine,

16:08.384 --> 16:10.595
but you have a choice.

16:10.637 --> 16:13.347
You can stay out here

16:10.637 --> 16:13.347
and have your little tantrum

16:13.389 --> 16:15.391
or you can go back inside,

16:13.389 --> 16:15.391
act like gentlemen

16:15.433 --> 16:17.184
eat your meal,

16:15.433 --> 16:17.184
have your dessert

16:17.226 --> 16:18.478
and everything

16:17.226 --> 16:18.478
will be cool, okay?

16:21.021 --> 16:22.231
Go ahead, guys.

16:22.273 --> 16:23.858
I got time.

16:22.273 --> 16:23.858
Talk amongst yourselves.

16:34.243 --> 16:37.288
Would anyone who's not

16:34.243 --> 16:37.288
shrieking care for dessert?

16:39.290 --> 16:41.542
There's only one dessert

16:39.290 --> 16:41.542
for me, and it's extinct.

16:43.127 --> 16:44.754
Yeah, I'll pass, too.

16:44.796 --> 16:46.506
I got a big day tomorrow.

16:46.547 --> 16:48.466
Gotta get that

16:46.547 --> 16:48.466
chia pet started.

16:50.134 --> 16:51.928
I'll have

16:50.134 --> 16:51.928
the triple-layer brownie

16:51.970 --> 16:53.888
with the butter cream

16:51.970 --> 16:53.888
frosting.

16:53.930 --> 16:54.973
Ah..

16:56.933 --> 16:58.977
- Oh!

16:56.933 --> 16:58.977
- Aww!

17:01.562 --> 17:04.899
Well, if no one else

17:01.562 --> 17:04.899
is interested..

17:04.941 --> 17:06.860
- No, wait!

17:04.941 --> 17:06.860
- Wait!

17:06.901 --> 17:09.362
Steph, if we both give in

17:06.901 --> 17:09.362
and eat those desserts

17:09.403 --> 17:12.365
at the same time,

17:09.403 --> 17:12.365
neither one of us would lose.

17:12.406 --> 17:14.033
What do you think?

17:14.074 --> 17:16.160
I think the one

17:14.074 --> 17:16.160
in the center looks delicious.

17:16.202 --> 17:18.746
Ah, that's the cookie

17:16.202 --> 17:18.746
crumble cheesecake

17:18.788 --> 17:21.123
and this is the very last piece,

17:18.788 --> 17:21.123
better jump on it.

17:21.165 --> 17:23.417
- We will!

17:21.165 --> 17:23.417
- Not literally.

17:23.459 --> 17:24.418
We'll take it.

17:29.131 --> 17:31.175
- Bet's off?

17:29.131 --> 17:31.175
- Bet's off.

17:32.552 --> 17:34.428
- Ahh!

17:32.552 --> 17:34.428
- Oh!

17:36.389 --> 17:39.976
Alright,

17:36.389 --> 17:39.976
right this way, gentlemen.

17:40.018 --> 17:41.686
Very good.

17:41.728 --> 17:43.396
Come on, son.

17:43.437 --> 17:46.065
Sit down here.

17:43.437 --> 17:46.065
Very good.

17:46.106 --> 17:47.107
'Here you go.'

17:47.149 --> 17:49.068
Well, look who's back.

17:49.109 --> 17:51.153
We're sorry.

17:51.195 --> 17:53.489
We'll be good.

17:58.870 --> 17:59.954
- Jess.

17:58.870 --> 17:59.954
- Hmm?

17:59.996 --> 18:02.248
Where are our children?

18:02.289 --> 18:05.251
Well, let's just say we

18:02.289 --> 18:05.251
came to an understanding.

18:05.292 --> 18:07.086
'When they go to a restaurant,

18:05.292 --> 18:07.086
they act like gentlemen.'

18:07.127 --> 18:09.714
When they go shopping,

18:07.127 --> 18:09.714
they'll be with their mother.

18:10.882 --> 18:11.883
Thanks.

18:11.925 --> 18:13.426
Ah, it was incredible.

18:13.467 --> 18:14.802
Um, what kind of cookies

18:13.467 --> 18:14.802
were in that

18:14.844 --> 18:16.721
cookie crumble cheesecake?

18:16.763 --> 18:19.432
Actually, that cheesecake

18:16.763 --> 18:19.432
was made with our very last tin

18:19.473 --> 18:21.350
of Vanilla Weasels.

18:21.392 --> 18:23.102
- Vanilla Weasels?

18:21.392 --> 18:23.102
- Yes, Vanilla Weasels.

18:23.143 --> 18:26.480
The most delectable

18:23.143 --> 18:26.480
cookie ever created.

18:26.522 --> 18:28.900
Weasel crumbs!

18:26.522 --> 18:28.900
They're mine!

18:28.942 --> 18:31.402
Mmm! Mmm! More!

18:31.444 --> 18:33.237
Mmm! I need more!

18:33.279 --> 18:34.864
Mmm! Mmm!

18:34.906 --> 18:37.867
Joey, get over it.

18:34.906 --> 18:37.867
Get on with your life.

18:37.909 --> 18:42.455
Oh-ho-ho, I can't

18:37.909 --> 18:42.455
get on with my life.

18:42.496 --> 18:43.497
Not without..

18:43.539 --> 18:44.707
Ooh, flan.

18:49.295 --> 18:51.380
Well, if there's nothing else..

18:51.422 --> 18:54.634
W-wait a minute,

18:51.422 --> 18:54.634
I thought I recognized you.

18:54.675 --> 18:57.678
You're on

18:54.675 --> 18:57.678
"Wake Up San Francisco."

18:57.720 --> 18:58.763
And you're not.

19:01.724 --> 19:03.434
Say, what's

19:01.724 --> 19:03.434
with this new guy?

19:03.476 --> 19:05.185
And where did

19:03.476 --> 19:05.185
he get that laugh?

19:05.227 --> 19:06.938
Yeah, I know,

19:05.227 --> 19:06.938
it's like a hyena.

19:06.980 --> 19:08.272
Yeah, hyena.

19:06.980 --> 19:08.272
That's it.

19:08.314 --> 19:10.357
Ba-ha. Ba-ha-ha-ha!

19:15.154 --> 19:18.908
Alright, so maybe

19:15.154 --> 19:18.908
he has a bad laugh.

19:18.950 --> 19:20.451
At least he has

19:18.950 --> 19:20.451
a good attitude.

19:20.493 --> 19:23.203
Why, because he howls

19:20.493 --> 19:23.203
at everything you say?

19:23.245 --> 19:25.915
He howls because now that

19:23.245 --> 19:25.915
you're gone the show is funny.

19:28.751 --> 19:31.004
Funny?

19:31.045 --> 19:34.256
Becky, I'll have you know that

19:31.045 --> 19:34.256
I watched the show this morning.

19:34.298 --> 19:35.633
I didn't wanna watch it,

19:34.298 --> 19:35.633
but you know

19:35.675 --> 19:37.468
I-I couldn't

19:35.675 --> 19:37.468
turn it off either.

19:37.510 --> 19:39.345
It's kinda like when you

19:37.510 --> 19:39.345
have a cavity and you-you know

19:39.386 --> 19:40.930
you wanna keep sucking

19:39.386 --> 19:40.930
air through the hole

19:40.972 --> 19:42.348
to see if it still hurts.

19:43.891 --> 19:47.269
Are you comparing my show

19:43.891 --> 19:47.269
to a rotting tooth?

19:47.311 --> 19:49.563
If the tooth hurts,

19:47.311 --> 19:49.563
suck it.

19:52.025 --> 19:54.276
You know, it's

19:52.025 --> 19:54.276
a good thing you quit

19:54.318 --> 19:56.236
because I'd fire

19:54.318 --> 19:56.236
you in a minute.

19:56.278 --> 19:59.198
It'd be fine with me

19:56.278 --> 19:59.198
because you and the happy

19:56.278 --> 19:59.198
hyena deserve each other.

19:59.239 --> 20:00.783
At least the happy hyena

19:59.239 --> 20:00.783
has a good attitude.

20:00.825 --> 20:03.619
'He has no attitude!

20:00.825 --> 20:03.619
He's a caricature!'

20:03.661 --> 20:04.662
[indistinct chattering]

20:04.704 --> 20:06.164
They're staring again.

20:07.206 --> 20:08.248
Alright! Alright!

20:08.290 --> 20:10.043
Hold it! Hold it!

20:10.084 --> 20:12.128
Now, one more outburst,

20:10.084 --> 20:12.128
I'm gonna pick you both up

20:12.170 --> 20:14.964
by your suspenders, and take you

20:12.170 --> 20:14.964
out to the screaming room.

20:15.006 --> 20:16.382
- She started it.

20:15.006 --> 20:16.382
- He started it.

20:16.423 --> 20:18.217
I don't care who started it.

20:18.258 --> 20:20.386
Now come on, you guys,

20:18.258 --> 20:20.386
you love each other.

20:20.427 --> 20:22.596
You're family.

20:20.427 --> 20:22.596
And you love working together.

20:22.638 --> 20:24.473
Now, this whole thing's

20:22.638 --> 20:24.473
just blown outta proportion

20:24.515 --> 20:26.934
because you got a little

20:24.515 --> 20:26.934
jealous over her promotion.

20:26.976 --> 20:29.269
I'm not jealous.

20:29.311 --> 20:30.354
You guys think

20:29.311 --> 20:30.354
I'm jealous?

20:30.396 --> 20:31.772
(in unison)

20:30.396 --> 20:31.772
Yes.

20:33.482 --> 20:35.526
Well, I'm not.

20:35.568 --> 20:37.862
It just bugged me that

20:35.568 --> 20:37.862
she got promoted and I didn't.

20:39.947 --> 20:42.408
That's jealous, isn't it?

20:42.449 --> 20:44.368
Come on, Danny,

20:42.449 --> 20:44.368
everybody gets jealous.

20:44.410 --> 20:47.246
You know, you just got jealous

20:44.410 --> 20:47.246
'cause Becky got a promotion.

20:47.287 --> 20:50.917
Heck, I get jealous 'cause

20:47.287 --> 20:50.917
people have, uh, girlfriends.

20:50.958 --> 20:52.459
Their own apartments.

20:53.460 --> 20:54.754
Lives.

20:56.172 --> 20:57.548
Another flan, please.

20:59.217 --> 21:01.510
Alright, look,

20:59.217 --> 21:01.510
I got to admit

21:01.552 --> 21:03.888
it stung when Becky

21:01.552 --> 21:03.888
got promoted over me.

21:03.930 --> 21:05.806
But I gotta accept it,

21:03.930 --> 21:05.806
and I will.

21:05.848 --> 21:08.017
Because I know she's gonna

21:05.848 --> 21:08.017
do a really a good job.

21:09.435 --> 21:12.396
Thanks, Danny.

21:09.435 --> 21:12.396
That's nice of you to say.

21:12.438 --> 21:14.148
I wasn't mad at you.

21:14.190 --> 21:15.858
I think I just went

21:14.190 --> 21:15.858
a little nuts

21:15.900 --> 21:18.694
because I got passed over

21:15.900 --> 21:18.694
in front of Michelle.

21:18.736 --> 21:20.863
I wanted her to be

21:18.736 --> 21:20.863
proud of me.

21:20.905 --> 21:22.782
Daddy, can I read you

21:20.905 --> 21:22.782
my report now?

21:22.823 --> 21:24.324
Honey, I'd-I'd love that.

21:24.366 --> 21:26.285
I'm sorry I didn't

21:24.366 --> 21:26.285
listen to it earlier.

21:29.830 --> 21:33.333
"My daddy was the best talk show

21:29.830 --> 21:33.333
host in the whole world.

21:33.375 --> 21:34.877
Everyone loved him.

21:34.919 --> 21:37.046
He was funny and nice

21:34.919 --> 21:37.046
and he made people

21:37.088 --> 21:39.590
choke on their bear claws.

21:39.632 --> 21:42.009
I wish my daddy were

21:39.632 --> 21:42.009
still a talk show host

21:42.051 --> 21:43.510
and so does everyone else."

21:44.971 --> 21:46.973
Thanks, honey.

21:44.971 --> 21:46.973
That helps a lot.

21:48.724 --> 21:50.726
Danny, she's right.

21:50.768 --> 21:53.146
I'd love for you

21:50.768 --> 21:53.146
to come back.

21:53.187 --> 21:56.107
I mean, the show's

21:53.187 --> 21:56.107
not the same without you.

21:56.149 --> 21:58.317
You're a great friend

21:56.149 --> 21:58.317
and a great co-host

21:58.358 --> 22:00.611
and if I had been

21:58.358 --> 22:00.611
a better producer

22:00.653 --> 22:02.404
I would have never

22:00.653 --> 22:02.404
let you get away.

22:03.823 --> 22:04.949
Oh, thanks, Beck.

22:07.785 --> 22:09.328
(in unison)

22:07.785 --> 22:09.328
You're the best.

22:09.369 --> 22:11.164
(in unison)

22:09.369 --> 22:11.164
I was gonna say that.
