( gibbers )
( laughs )

00:07.769 --> 00:10.076
When I got the job,
I was like, "finally!"

00:10.169 --> 00:12.976
Right? The whole goal
was to work in Television.

00:13.269 --> 00:15.568
But now, all I'm doing
is getting coffee

00:15.595 --> 00:17.501
for people who work
in Television.

00:18.969 --> 00:21.771
- Are you even listening?
- Totally.

00:23.607 --> 00:26.843
That was water.
What--?

00:26.877 --> 00:29.712
Dude, if I could just figure out
a way to get that promotion--

00:29.747 --> 00:31.781
Look at him. It's like
he invented peek-a-boo.

00:33.617 --> 00:35.885
So much for bartenders
being good listeners.

00:37.021 --> 00:38.921
I just don't want
to see Riley get hurt by some

00:38.956 --> 00:41.824
rugged, stubbly-faced,

00:41.859 --> 00:43.960
peek-a-boo-playing liar.

00:43.994 --> 00:45.895
I'm telling you--
I don't trust that guy.

00:45.929 --> 00:47.997
I actually like Dr. Fitch.

00:48.032 --> 00:50.933
And I don't even think
he's a real doctor.

00:50.968 --> 00:53.770
He has a Ph.D.
in Social Work from Harvard.

00:53.804 --> 00:57.807
Yeah, good luck with that next
time you come down with the flu.

00:57.841 --> 01:00.843
Am I really the only one
who sees through this guy's act?

01:00.878 --> 01:02.879
Runs an orphanage
in Zimbabwe?

01:02.913 --> 01:05.548
Worked for the Peace Corps?
( Scoffs )

01:05.582 --> 01:08.518
- Who hasn't used that line?
- What line?

01:09.553 --> 01:11.521
Hey, CeeCee,
have you met Tucker?

01:11.555 --> 01:13.956
- He just got back from the Peace Corps.
- Hmmm.

01:13.991 --> 01:16.559
Maybe we can have
a drink sometime.

01:20.731 --> 01:23.666
Am I the only one
who didn't know about this?

01:24.902 --> 01:27.570
I know him
because I am him.

01:27.604 --> 01:29.705
And here I come.
Hey, Fitch!

01:29.740 --> 01:32.775
Hey, guys. Thanks for letting me
spend the day with your little lady.

01:32.810 --> 01:35.711
You, my friend,
are a role model.

01:35.746 --> 01:38.681
Single dad?
Nothing but respect.

01:38.715 --> 01:40.616
Catch you later.

01:41.685 --> 01:43.553
Wow,

01:43.587 --> 01:45.555
what a jerk.

01:46.757 --> 01:48.524
Hey, how do you guys
know Fitch?

01:48.559 --> 01:49.959
He's dating our friend.
Wait.

01:49.993 --> 01:53.496
- How do you know Fitch?
- He's a bartender at McDillon's.

01:54.832 --> 01:56.766
A bartender?

01:56.800 --> 01:58.701
Ha ha. I knew it!

01:58.735 --> 02:01.471
Wow.
He really is you.

02:13.851 --> 02:16.652
Riley, I get no pleasure
in telling you this,

02:16.687 --> 02:18.621
but Fitch is not
who he says he is.

02:18.655 --> 02:21.724
He's actually a bartender
at McDillon's.

02:21.758 --> 02:24.527
Oh my God,
are you serious?

02:24.561 --> 02:26.596
Fitch is a bartender?

02:26.630 --> 02:29.866
What kind of a monster makes drinks
and serves them to people?

02:30.400 --> 02:32.869
Exactly my point.

02:32.903 --> 02:36.472
He's been tending bar there
on and off since grad school.

02:36.507 --> 02:38.808
He said he can make
enough money in a night

02:38.842 --> 02:42.712
to dig a well that would bring
fresh water to an entire village.

02:45.516 --> 02:47.950
Really?
I should work at McDillon's.

02:48.485 --> 02:50.853
Ben, Fitch is sweet,
selfless,

02:50.888 --> 02:52.922
and possesses one
of my favorite qualities:

02:52.956 --> 02:55.992
He likes me! So keep your comments
and opinions to yourself.

02:56.026 --> 02:57.927
- Riley, I just--
- To yourself!

02:58.962 --> 03:00.830
( Vibrates )

03:00.864 --> 03:02.765
It's work.

03:02.799 --> 03:04.667
Chase needs me.

03:05.736 --> 03:06.903
Chase needs me!

03:07.937 --> 03:09.505
Bossman chase?

03:09.540 --> 03:10.840
What other chase
is there?

03:10.874 --> 03:13.509
The star
of "chase live" chase.

03:13.544 --> 03:15.578
Nicest-guy-on-TV chase.

03:15.612 --> 03:18.714
Oh my God, I didn't even
think he knew my name.

03:18.749 --> 03:21.717
Do you know what this means?
Oh God.

03:21.752 --> 03:25.955
I'm finally going to be recognized for
my talents and leadership skills.

03:25.989 --> 03:29.759
( Moans )

03:29.793 --> 03:32.795
Too hot. Too dark.
Too sweet--

03:32.829 --> 03:35.831
unless you're talking about me.
( Laughs )

03:35.866 --> 03:38.000
- Listen, Thomas--
- Uh, Tucker.

03:38.035 --> 03:39.835
Thomas Tucker.
I like it.

03:39.870 --> 03:41.837
Good alliteration.
Look, man,

03:41.872 --> 03:43.973
thanks for hanging out
while I got my makeup done.

03:44.007 --> 03:47.577
Technically I'm not allowed around
the other female employees.

03:47.611 --> 03:50.713
If you ask me, those chicks in
Legal are being a little sexist.

03:50.747 --> 03:52.782
I am happy to help.

03:52.816 --> 03:54.917
- So I was wondering if I could--
- Talk to me.

03:56.687 --> 03:58.921
The cover?
All right!

03:58.956 --> 04:01.023
How compromising?

04:01.058 --> 04:03.960
Well, why didn't somebody
tell me she was married?

04:03.994 --> 04:06.762
Okay, Kenny,
make it go away.

04:07.297 --> 04:09.699
I don't know. Find something for
me to pretend I care about.

04:09.733 --> 04:12.501
- ( Beeps )
- If only I could find one decent person

04:12.536 --> 04:14.570
to step up and handle
things around here.

04:14.605 --> 04:16.738
That is kind of what I
wanted to talk you about.

04:16.773 --> 04:18.774
Thomas, I forgot
that you were here.

04:19.509 --> 04:22.945
- But you're exactly who I need right now.
- I am?!

04:22.980 --> 04:25.514
Yeah, because I'm going
to wardrobe

04:25.549 --> 04:28.851
and actually I'm not allowed to be alone
with those women either. Let's move.

04:30.954 --> 04:32.922
- ( Door opens )
- Hello!

04:32.956 --> 04:34.724
Whoa whoa!

04:34.758 --> 04:36.626
Guess I don't
need cable anymore.

04:37.660 --> 04:40.529
Hey, Ma.
You remember Milena--

04:40.564 --> 04:42.965
and that you don't
live here.

04:43.000 --> 04:45.835
( Enunciating )
Hello Milena!

04:45.869 --> 04:47.670
How are you?

04:47.704 --> 04:49.872
Mom, she speaks English.

04:51.608 --> 04:53.509
So a supermodel, huh?

04:53.543 --> 04:55.778
I was going to be a model
when I was your age.

04:55.812 --> 04:59.615
Could barely walk down the street--
"Oh, Bonnie, you should be a model!"

04:59.650 --> 05:01.517
So why didn't you?

05:01.551 --> 05:04.920
Well, one drunken prom night
and a giant baby later,

05:04.955 --> 05:07.823
and I realized I wanted
more out of life.

05:07.858 --> 05:10.693
- That's a sweet story.
- Then I didn't tell it right.

05:11.828 --> 05:14.630
Hey, Mom, could you take
a picture of me and Milena?

05:14.665 --> 05:16.565
She wants to send one home
to her mom.

05:19.636 --> 05:21.570
- <i>( Clicks )</i>
<i>- There.</i>

05:21.605 --> 05:25.808
The sort of softcore photo any mother
would be happy to put on her mantel.

05:25.842 --> 05:27.943
And I will see you
tonight, miss.

05:30.580 --> 05:32.848
- <i>Do svidaniya.</i>
<i>- Hasta la danke schoen!</i>

05:37.754 --> 05:39.789
I guess it's true
what they say,

05:39.823 --> 05:42.892
all boys end up dating some
version of their mother.

05:43.926 --> 05:45.561
I like her.

05:45.595 --> 05:48.964
- Yeah, so do I.
- But what I really like

05:48.999 --> 05:51.767
is that you're not mooning
over Riley anymore.

05:51.802 --> 05:53.270
( Scoffs )

05:53.296 --> 05:54.737
I never mooned over Ri--

05:54.771 --> 05:56.806
( mimics scoff )

05:57.340 --> 06:00.943
Yeah, that's nice too.
But it's been tough to move on.

06:00.977 --> 06:04.613
I've been in love with her ever since
she first climbed into my tree house.

06:04.648 --> 06:06.782
I kinda just always
thought she was...

06:06.817 --> 06:08.684
The one.

06:08.719 --> 06:11.721
But she's never going to see me
that way and I'm done.

06:11.755 --> 06:13.622
Well, honey,
I am proud of you.

06:13.657 --> 06:15.858
I'm just glad I never
actually told her how I felt.

06:15.892 --> 06:18.494
I could have lost
my best friend.

06:18.528 --> 06:20.763
Well, you didn't
and you're moving on.

06:20.797 --> 06:24.633
Yeah, I just don't think we'd
ever be the same if she knew.

06:24.668 --> 06:27.670
Voicemail: <i>If you're satisfied</i>
<i>with your message press one.</i>

06:27.704 --> 06:30.506
Oh no,
no no no no no no!

06:30.540 --> 06:32.908
You must have hit Riley's number
when you took that picture.

06:32.943 --> 06:35.845
That is not possible.
Give me that. Just--

06:35.879 --> 06:37.813
- ( beeps )
- <i>Message sent.</i>

06:37.848 --> 06:39.849
- Mom!
- All right, all right,

06:39.883 --> 06:41.817
I definitely did not
want to do that.

06:41.852 --> 06:44.587
But you know what, honey?
I'm sure it's going to be fine.

06:44.621 --> 06:46.655
I-- I-- I bet it didn't
even go through.

06:46.690 --> 06:49.825
Hello, we're back!
Did you just try to call me, Danny?

06:50.861 --> 06:52.928
Um, I don't think so.
Let me check.

06:52.963 --> 06:55.731
Oh ha, butt dial!

06:55.766 --> 06:58.667
Erase it. I'm sure my butt
doesn't have too much to say.

06:58.702 --> 07:00.636
So what have you two
been up to?

07:00.670 --> 07:02.471
Us? Nothing.

07:02.506 --> 07:04.907
I mean can't a mother
stop by to see her son?

07:04.941 --> 07:06.909
I mean so many
questions, Riley.

07:08.612 --> 07:10.846
Okay then, I'll just
put Emma down for her nap.

07:10.881 --> 07:12.782
( Fusses )

07:14.851 --> 07:18.587
So, Dr. Fitch,
small medical question...

07:18.622 --> 07:21.724
I've got this thing
in my eye... um, here.

07:21.758 --> 07:23.492
- Oh yeah, I see it.
- Wait, what?

07:23.527 --> 07:25.561
There's something
really wrong with my eye?

07:25.595 --> 07:27.496
Actually, I'm not
that kind of doctor.

07:27.531 --> 07:29.765
Then why are you giving
out medical advice? Gah!

07:29.800 --> 07:31.901
Is everything
okay out here?

07:31.935 --> 07:34.537
Who are you,
the question police?

07:35.705 --> 07:37.640
Oh hey, how's it goin',
Mrs. Wheeler?

07:37.674 --> 07:39.642
God, it's like
a quiz show in here.

07:40.710 --> 07:42.645
We really should
get you going, huh?

07:42.679 --> 07:45.548
So Fitch just started
this amazing charity.

07:45.582 --> 07:48.551
He rescues homeless puppies
and pairs them with orphans.

07:48.585 --> 07:50.753
He calls it
"Woofs for the World."

07:50.787 --> 07:53.923
Isn't that just like the sweetest
thing you've ever heard of?

07:53.957 --> 07:56.659
If you're not asking me
to donate--

07:56.693 --> 07:57.893
then adorable.

07:57.928 --> 08:00.629
I'm meeting with the board
this afternoon.

08:00.664 --> 08:02.698
We need to name a new
spokesperson by tomorrow.

08:02.732 --> 08:04.533
Oh, well, good luck.

08:04.568 --> 08:06.702
...Is standing right
in front of you!

08:06.736 --> 08:09.505
I've got the guy.

08:09.539 --> 08:11.574
Chase Baxter!

08:13.543 --> 08:14.777
- No.
- Probably not.

08:14.811 --> 08:17.713
No! He's the nicest
guy in America.

08:17.747 --> 08:20.683
Who also tried to cop a feel
when I stopped by the studio.

08:20.717 --> 08:22.718
He thought
you were choking.

08:22.752 --> 08:24.887
I don't know, Tuck.
I haven't heard great things about him.

08:24.921 --> 08:27.656
But think
of the children!

08:27.691 --> 08:29.625

Secret's out, Fitch.

09:21.561 --> 09:24.563
- Oh, perfect timing.
- Riley, hey, we need to talk about Fitch.

09:24.597 --> 09:27.133
- I don't know how to say this--
- Do not even think about finishing that sentence

09:27.167 --> 09:29.101
unless it involves
the words amazing,

09:29.136 --> 09:31.337
handsome or someday I'd like
to dance at your wedding.

09:32.406 --> 09:34.473
Well, the wedding part
was kinda close.

Ben, Fitch and I have
a very special night planned,

09:41.181 --> 09:44.417
a special night.
So whatever it is, I don't care.

09:44.451 --> 09:46.485
- I'm not listening.
- Riley!

09:46.520 --> 09:49.155
- Nope.
- Hey, was that Riley?

09:49.889 --> 09:52.124
No, I was just randomly
shouting out people's names.

09:53.260 --> 09:55.461
- Danny!
- Yeah?

09:57.397 --> 10:00.299
- Never mind.
- Do you know where she was going?

10:00.334 --> 10:03.536
She's going to meet Fitch at The Sweaty Cow,
but we have a serious problem. Fitch--

10:03.570 --> 10:06.372
--Is a Saint. Yeah.

10:06.406 --> 10:09.508
And I don't want to hear one
more negative word about him.

10:10.043 --> 10:12.211
He is my ticket
out of Coffee Town.

10:13.480 --> 10:15.081
It's gonna be fine.

10:15.115 --> 10:16.549
How am I ever going
to figure out her password?

10:16.583 --> 10:19.352

when I'm babysitting.

10:31.631 --> 10:34.267
Hey. Oh good,
you found my phone.

10:34.301 --> 10:36.235

I realized it was missing.

Oh no no. Riley, I'm sorry,
this is-- this is my phone.

10:40.207 --> 10:42.341
You can tell
because I have a--

10:42.376 --> 10:44.443
Fitch screensaver.

10:47.314 --> 10:49.115
- Uh. - Thank you! See ya later.

10:50.183 --> 10:52.218
Riley, hey, me again.

10:52.252 --> 10:55.388
Please just call me
before anything too...

10:55.422 --> 10:57.456
special happens.

10:57.491 --> 10:59.492
It's important.

11:01.528 --> 11:03.496
She needs to know, right?

11:04.030 --> 11:07.266
I mean, you'd want to know if you were
going out with a married cheater.

11:08.568 --> 11:10.503
<i>( Knocks )</i>

11:11.237 --> 11:12.471
We both agree,

11:12.506 --> 11:15.441
I have to try and stop her.
Okay.

11:16.475 --> 11:18.177
- ( Coos )
- Huh?

11:19.211 --> 11:20.212
Hi, Ben.

11:20.247 --> 11:22.081
- Is Danny here?
- No.

11:23.383 --> 11:25.551
But how are you with kids?

11:28.288 --> 11:30.456
Everything looks so good.
I don't know what to order.

11:30.990 --> 11:33.526
I remember the first time I ate here
I had just come back from India.

11:33.560 --> 11:36.395
I actually helped birth a calf.
They're sacred, you know.

11:36.430 --> 11:39.498
Mmmmm, steak,
that's a good idea.

11:39.533 --> 11:43.135
So, you've been here
before?

11:43.170 --> 11:45.438
I hope it wasn't
for another special night?

11:45.472 --> 11:47.440
No, don't worry.

11:49.176 --> 11:50.443
Actually,

11:50.477 --> 11:53.145
Riley, there's something I've
been wanting to tell you.

11:53.180 --> 11:56.115
Excuse me, Fitch Douglas?
You have a phone call inside.

11:57.150 --> 11:58.384
Um, okay.

12:01.121 --> 12:04.090
Uh, two seconds.
I promise.

12:04.124 --> 12:05.358
Oh yeah.

12:08.161 --> 12:09.261
Ben!

12:11.030 --> 12:12.298
Two seconds, I promise.

12:12.332 --> 12:16.202
Now? No! I'm on a date. And Fitch will be right back.
He just-- he got a call.

12:16.236 --> 12:18.304
Yeah, I know.
That waiter cost me 20 bucks.

12:18.338 --> 12:20.473
Ben, he was about to tell me
something important.

12:20.507 --> 12:22.441
Well, not to be
all competitive,

12:22.476 --> 12:25.311
but my important is probably
a lot bigger than his important.

12:26.413 --> 12:30.182
Oh, isn't this just
the cutest place?

12:30.217 --> 12:32.084
Oh hey, good.
It's just Ben.

12:32.119 --> 12:35.054
I thought you were on a date and I was
afraid we were going to mess it up.

12:35.088 --> 12:37.523
- I am and you are.
- You two are on a date?

12:37.557 --> 12:39.291
- No.
- We could be.

12:39.326 --> 12:41.427
- Why are you here?
- Um...

12:41.461 --> 12:43.195
- We--
- Takeout.

12:43.230 --> 12:46.132
Yes! We were just coming
to get a little takeout.

12:46.166 --> 12:48.300
I just had
a craving for...

12:48.335 --> 12:51.337
A $30 salad?!

12:51.371 --> 12:54.240
Are you guys stupid?

12:56.109 --> 12:57.343
Oh hey!

12:57.377 --> 12:59.445
Fake candles,
I love these things--

12:59.479 --> 13:01.447
ow, no!
That one's real.

13:01.481 --> 13:05.284
Oh hey, everyone's here.
Do you guys want to join us?

13:05.318 --> 13:07.319
- No, we're good.
- ( Mutters ) No phone!

13:07.354 --> 13:09.155
We'd love to!

13:09.189 --> 13:11.190
No, no one else
is joining us.

13:11.224 --> 13:13.325
Oh thank God, this table
is cramped already.

13:13.360 --> 13:16.028
- Seriously, I need two seconds.
- No.

13:16.062 --> 13:18.330
- They're probably just out--
- Oh hey!

13:18.365 --> 13:20.065
You're all here.

13:20.100 --> 13:22.401
I was afraid we were going
to be interrupting something.

13:22.436 --> 13:26.105
- Why would you ever think that?
- Fitch, I just want to make sure

13:26.139 --> 13:29.175
you didn't miss out
on this amazing opportunity.

13:29.209 --> 13:31.343
Nobody loves puppies...

13:32.078 --> 13:34.513
Or kids more than
Chase Baxter.

13:34.548 --> 13:37.416
It's true.
You show me a kid I don't like

13:37.451 --> 13:40.052
and I'll prove
it isn't mine.

13:40.086 --> 13:43.189
- That's what blood tests are for.
- You know what? That is it.

13:43.223 --> 13:45.324
- Everybody out!
- Excellent idea, Riley.

13:45.358 --> 13:48.093
Family meeting.
Two seconds and we will all be gone.

13:48.128 --> 13:50.095
Everyone follow me.

13:50.130 --> 13:53.299
I'll keep the good doctor
and the babysitter company.

13:56.236 --> 13:58.270
You know I'm nationally
syndicated, right?

13:59.306 --> 14:01.106
You're coming with us.

14:02.209 --> 14:05.044
Hi, sorry, if we could
get a little privacy?

14:05.078 --> 14:06.412
Thank you.

14:06.446 --> 14:09.448
- Ben, what is so important?
- Fitch is married.

14:09.483 --> 14:12.051
What?

14:12.085 --> 14:16.188
This is crazy!
We should call someone.

14:16.223 --> 14:19.391
Riley, can I borrow
your phone?

14:21.394 --> 14:23.128
Riley, after you
kissed him goodbye,

14:23.163 --> 14:25.030
he took a wedding ring
out of his pocket

14:25.065 --> 14:27.333
- and put it on his finger.
- You were following me?

14:27.367 --> 14:30.202
Dude, that's
a little creepy.

14:30.237 --> 14:32.271
I'm gonna beat the crap
out of that guy.

14:32.305 --> 14:35.174
Definitely been on the wrong end
of that conversation, my man.

14:37.544 --> 14:40.446
Riley, I'm your friend and I can't
let you have a special night

14:40.480 --> 14:43.249
with a guy who's also having
special nights with his wife.

14:44.283 --> 14:46.185
You know, depending on
how long they've been married,

14:46.219 --> 14:49.355
it's probably not
that special.

14:49.389 --> 14:51.390
You're wrong.
I just-- I know you are.

14:51.424 --> 14:54.393
- Then why don't you ask him?
- All right.

14:57.130 --> 14:59.365
Hey, what's going on?
Why is she crying?

14:59.399 --> 15:02.034
- What did you say to her?
- Get in line.

15:02.068 --> 15:05.371
Fitch, are you
or are you not married?

15:08.208 --> 15:10.409
That's what I wanted
to tell you.

15:10.443 --> 15:14.179
- See? I told you.
- She's dead!

15:16.383 --> 15:19.084
Good one, son.

15:21.283 --> 15:23.084
It's just all happened so quickly...

15:23.463 --> 15:26.431
In fact Wendy never
saw the elephant coming--

15:26.466 --> 15:29.568
or more importantly--
sitting.

15:30.302 --> 15:33.205
Fitch, that is so sad.

15:33.239 --> 15:36.341
I know I should've told you sooner, but it's
not something you can just drop on someone.

15:36.376 --> 15:38.276
No pun intended.

15:41.614 --> 15:44.449
Just trying to lighten the mood.
You poor thing.

15:45.685 --> 15:48.420
It's okay.
Every day it gets easier.

15:48.454 --> 15:51.590
It's been a year, but I still feel
guilty whenever I take off the ring.

15:51.624 --> 15:54.593
That's amazing.
A heartfelt story for every occasion.

15:54.627 --> 15:57.429
You may want to pull back
on this one, little bro.

15:57.463 --> 15:59.531
Ben, I think you owe
Fitch an apology.

15:59.565 --> 16:02.367
Why? You're obviously going to
believe whatever he tells you.

16:02.402 --> 16:04.236
You know what--
I've had enough, okay?

16:04.270 --> 16:06.138
Actually, Ben...

16:06.172 --> 16:08.106
I've had enough.

16:08.141 --> 16:10.175
I think it's time you and I
had a conversation.

16:10.209 --> 16:12.477
- Alone.
- You need backup, bro?

16:13.212 --> 16:16.181
- No, I'm good.
- I'm talking to Fitch.

16:19.152 --> 16:21.386
Wow, talk about
a special night.

16:21.421 --> 16:25.357
Where is my phone?
I keep losing that stupid thing.

16:25.391 --> 16:27.426
I'll call it for you,
sweetness.

16:29.362 --> 16:31.530
Thomas, dial.

16:31.564 --> 16:34.232
You obviously have a lot
of hostility towards me.

16:34.267 --> 16:36.334
And I want you to know
that I understand it.

16:36.369 --> 16:39.504
- We're a lot alike, you and me.
- Kind of what I've been trying to tell people.

16:39.539 --> 16:41.506
We both have feelings
for the same girl.

16:41.541 --> 16:44.109
Not what I've been
trying to tell people.

16:44.143 --> 16:46.478
Ben, when my wife died,

16:46.512 --> 16:49.247
I thought that was it--
it was over.

16:49.282 --> 16:52.284
I'd never be able to feel that
way about another person again.

16:52.818 --> 16:54.386
But then I met Riley

16:54.420 --> 16:56.555
and I felt that spark.

16:57.322 --> 17:00.525
I can't believe it, but I'm
actually falling in love with her.

17:03.062 --> 17:06.098
But the one thing that
I could never do

17:06.132 --> 17:09.201
is stand in the way of somebody
else who may love her more.

17:13.539 --> 17:18.210
God, can't you just punch me in
the face like a normal dude?

17:18.243 --> 17:20.311
There's no greater weapon
than compassion.

17:22.348 --> 17:25.349
Just look me in the eye
and tell me she's your true love

17:25.384 --> 17:27.352
and I'll disappear.

17:30.256 --> 17:32.524
- <i>( Cellphone rings )</i>
<i>- It's ringing.</i>

17:33.558 --> 17:35.327
I don't hear anything.

17:35.861 --> 17:38.130
Oh, it's right there--
in your boob.

17:41.334 --> 17:43.301
Why do you keep
taking my phone?

17:46.139 --> 17:49.141
I'm sorry, Riley, here.

17:52.445 --> 17:54.346
Ha!

17:54.380 --> 17:55.580
What is wrong with you?

17:55.615 --> 17:59.351
I'm thinking low blood sugar.
The service here is horrible!

18:01.120 --> 18:03.455
It's your call.
What do you say, Ben?

18:05.224 --> 18:07.292
I don't know what to say.

18:07.326 --> 18:09.361
I mean yes, I have
feelings for her,

18:09.395 --> 18:12.130
but I'm still
sorting them out.

18:12.165 --> 18:13.465
If you know, you know.

18:14.199 --> 18:15.433
Do you love her?

18:17.136 --> 18:19.104
I love her...

18:19.438 --> 18:22.340
enough as a friend to know

18:22.375 --> 18:25.143
that I can't stand
in her way.

18:25.178 --> 18:29.014
So if you and Riley are really
meant to be then I will try

18:29.048 --> 18:31.049
and be happy for you guys.

18:32.318 --> 18:35.053
You're a good guy, Ben.

18:35.087 --> 18:37.289
Not that good.

18:37.323 --> 18:39.491
I also paid the waiter
to dump iced tea on you later.

18:42.161 --> 18:44.129
I am so sorry
about my friends.

18:44.163 --> 18:47.332
They're equal parts
crazy and protective.

18:47.366 --> 18:50.335
Actually not so equal.

18:50.969 --> 18:53.171
But I think it's kinda nice
how much they care.

18:53.206 --> 18:55.240
Yeah, me too.

18:59.478 --> 19:01.379
We should
probably go, huh?

19:01.414 --> 19:03.381
I mean I'm only
two blocks from here, so.

19:03.416 --> 19:06.117
Did you see that they ruined my phone?
The thing's soaked.

19:06.185 --> 19:08.119
Let me take a look.

19:08.154 --> 19:09.387
It's totally fixable.

19:12.158 --> 19:14.426
<i>If you would like to replay</i>

19:21.300 --> 19:23.468
- Hey. Is everything okay?
- Yeah.

19:23.502 --> 19:27.172
I'm sorry to stop by so late.
Do you have a minute to talk?

19:27.206 --> 19:29.241
Always.
Is this about Fitch?

19:29.275 --> 19:32.143
Um, yeah, kind of.

19:32.178 --> 19:34.346
I just--
I'm a little confused.

19:34.380 --> 19:38.149
Really? You guys
seem great together.

19:38.184 --> 19:41.186
- You think so?
- Yeah.

19:41.220 --> 19:45.156
- Don't you?
- Yeah yeah.

19:45.191 --> 19:47.459
I just don't know
if he's the one, you know?

19:47.493 --> 19:50.228
We don't have
that much in common.

19:50.263 --> 19:53.098
It's not like you and me.

19:53.132 --> 19:55.400
Me and you...

19:55.434 --> 19:59.237
That's different,
we're friends.

19:59.272 --> 20:02.140
Friends who can tell
each other anything.

20:03.276 --> 20:04.476
Yup...

20:04.510 --> 20:07.145
Anything.

20:08.447 --> 20:11.082
Anything?

20:12.285 --> 20:14.052
Riley--

20:14.086 --> 20:16.054
Danny?

20:22.161 --> 20:23.461
I should probably
get back.

20:23.496 --> 20:26.498
Yeah yeah,
I should go too.

20:28.334 --> 20:31.169
- Did that help?
- Oh totally, I'm good.

20:31.203 --> 20:32.537
Um, I'll call you tomorrow.

20:32.571 --> 20:35.407
- After you get a new phone, right?
- Right.

20:35.441 --> 20:36.541
Bye.

20:37.175 --> 20:38.376
Bye.
