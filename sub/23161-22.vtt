WEBVTT

00:00.034 --> 00:02.832
I don't understand you.
You think you're going
to a summer camp?

00:02.904 --> 00:06.670
If it's just a farm. I'm gonna
do a little manual labor
and watch a lot of TV.

00:08.542 --> 00:10.032
Lunch!

00:10.111 --> 00:12.238
You wanted to know why I'm here.
I'm telling you.

00:12.313 --> 00:14.247
Now Jack Damon wants
to find his daughter.

00:14.315 --> 00:15.339
Where's Becky?

00:15.416 --> 00:17.509
I mean,
she could be in trouble.
She could be hurt.

00:17.585 --> 00:19.280
She could be dead
for all we know.

00:23.190 --> 00:24.623
You are in danger, Thomas.

00:27.261 --> 00:29.752
Hold it! Hold it!

02:43.730 --> 02:45.425
Over here.

02:58.645 --> 02:59.737
It's all there.

03:11.591 --> 03:13.684
Move! Move! Move!

03:28.508 --> 03:30.100
I'm hit!

03:32.012 --> 03:33.138
I'm hit.

03:34.814 --> 03:37.476
We got to get us
somewhere safe. Safe.

03:38.685 --> 03:40.346
Take us to a hospital.

03:42.355 --> 03:44.289
Take us to a hospital, Darryl.

03:45.225 --> 03:47.716
Darryl! Please!

03:48.395 --> 03:49.453
Shut up!

03:49.796 --> 03:51.730
Please take me
to the hospital!

03:51.798 --> 03:54.164
Shut up! Shut up!
Darryl, please!

03:55.335 --> 03:56.359
Oh, God.

03:57.670 --> 04:01.333
<i>It's the kind</i>
<i>of pain you're almost</i>
<i>glad to experience.</i>

04:01.441 --> 04:06.504
<i>That satisfying soreness</i>
<i>I used to feel on Saturday</i>
<i>nights after a big Navy win.</i>

04:07.213 --> 04:10.307
<i>And the kind of</i>
<i>sweet agony I still feel</i>
<i>on Monday mornings</i>

04:10.383 --> 04:12.544
<i>after 18 innings</i>
<i>of Sunday softball.</i>

04:13.219 --> 04:15.813
<i>Your muscles scream,</i>
<i>"Was this really necessary?"</i>

04:15.889 --> 04:19.188
<i>And your answer,</i>
<i>"Take it easy, guys.</i>
<i>I'll make you a deal.</i>

04:19.526 --> 04:22.825
<i>"You go to sleep and heal up,</i>
<i>and I promise not to move.</i>

04:23.163 --> 04:24.323
<i>"Ever again."</i>

04:27.734 --> 04:29.099
Magnum.

04:31.404 --> 04:32.393
Magnum.

04:34.841 --> 04:36.604
Magnum!
Higgins.

04:39.245 --> 04:41.270
Why don't you ever knock?

04:43.450 --> 04:46.783
Not that door.
The one upstairs.

04:48.721 --> 04:50.382
Magnum, please.
You have to come out.

04:50.457 --> 04:51.515
No!

04:57.363 --> 04:58.660
No, Higgins,

04:59.299 --> 05:01.324
I don't have to come out.

05:04.237 --> 05:06.068
But I'm going to.

05:08.675 --> 05:10.267
Just long enough

05:10.343 --> 05:12.368
to make sure that you leave.

05:12.445 --> 05:16.279
I'm sore, Higgins,
and I do not want
to be disturbed.

05:21.354 --> 05:23.219
Sorry, I thought
you'd be up.

05:24.290 --> 05:25.655
This is Mr. Damon.

05:25.725 --> 05:27.215
I suggested
that he return later.

05:27.293 --> 05:30.490
But apparently,
he's here on a matter
of extreme urgency.

05:32.732 --> 05:33.960
Are you sick?

05:34.334 --> 05:35.631
What?
Sick?

05:36.469 --> 05:37.561
No.

05:37.871 --> 05:40.931
I just over exerted
a little this weekend.

05:41.241 --> 05:43.402
It's a very important,
strenuous case.

05:47.213 --> 05:49.977
Do we know each other,
Mr. Damon?
No, we don't.

05:50.049 --> 05:52.347
Mr. Magnum, are you busy
at the moment?

05:53.286 --> 05:54.548
At the moment?

05:54.888 --> 05:57.618
Well, if I'm going to
stay up and talk to you,

05:57.690 --> 06:01.387
then, yes, at the moment
I'm busy making coffee.
Would you like some?

06:02.629 --> 06:04.995
Thank you, I had some
several hours ago.

06:05.165 --> 06:07.030
Look, I need help.

06:07.534 --> 06:09.434
You'd have to start
on the case now.

06:09.502 --> 06:10.730
This morning.

06:11.070 --> 06:12.298
This morning?

06:13.573 --> 06:15.598
Listen, I'm sorry.

06:15.675 --> 06:19.167
I can barely walk.
I've got to go back to bed
right after I eat.

06:19.245 --> 06:21.372
He wakes regularly
for long feeding.

06:21.447 --> 06:23.847
That's cute, Higgins.
I am sore!

06:23.917 --> 06:26.613
Which is hardly
a sufficient excuse
for rudeness.

06:26.786 --> 06:28.276
All right. Never mind.
Forget about it.

06:28.354 --> 06:30.254
No, no, wait,
wait a minute, please.

06:30.323 --> 06:32.484
No, Mr. Magnum.
I don't want
to be offensive,

06:32.559 --> 06:35.323
but I really don't have
time to wait for you
to feel like walking.

06:35.395 --> 06:36.419
Time for what?

06:36.496 --> 06:39.397
Look, I think it would help
both of us if you told me
why you're here.

06:39.465 --> 06:41.126
Yes, it would.

06:41.534 --> 06:42.523
Carol?

06:42.869 --> 06:44.962
Thomas, didn't you
get my message?

06:45.138 --> 06:47.072
No.

06:47.240 --> 06:50.209
I didn't check
my machine

06:50.276 --> 06:51.868
after I got back
from work.

06:52.545 --> 06:54.843
Well, I don't understand.
What's going on?

06:54.914 --> 06:56.279
Neither do I.

06:56.349 --> 06:58.817
Carol, you're acquainted
with Mr. Damon?

06:58.885 --> 07:00.284
Yes, he's my uncle.

07:00.353 --> 07:03.811
I told you that I would talk
with Thomas this morning
and then I would call you.

07:03.890 --> 07:06.859
Yes, Carol. And I told you
that I cannot afford
to waste anymore time.

07:06.926 --> 07:09.224
I decided to
come out here and speak
to Mr. Magnum myself.

07:09.295 --> 07:12.458
I've done that.
He's not available, so fine.
I did not say that.

07:12.532 --> 07:15.467
And we did not talk.
Now, what is it
that's so urgent?

07:15.535 --> 07:16.695
Maybe I can help.

07:16.769 --> 07:19.033
Carol trusts you.
She thinks you'll be
able to help. Fine.

07:19.105 --> 07:20.265
Let her hire you.

07:20.340 --> 07:23.832
Personally, I think
he's gonna be about as much
use to Becky as you were.

07:24.844 --> 07:25.936
Becky?

07:26.879 --> 07:28.039
Who's Becky?

07:28.281 --> 07:30.545
<i>Thomas, are you there?</i>

07:32.819 --> 07:36.050
<i>Look, would you please call me</i>
<i>as soon as you get in?</i>

07:36.289 --> 07:39.918
<i>If I don't hear from you</i>
<i>then I'm coming out</i>
<i>in the morning.</i>

07:40.727 --> 07:42.888
<i>It's about my cousin.</i>

07:42.962 --> 07:45.192
<i>Nobody's seen her</i>
<i>for two months.</i>

07:45.832 --> 07:48.562
<i>Thomas, she's 17.</i>

07:49.168 --> 07:52.934
<i>And I just have to find her.</i>
<i>If anything happens to her,</i>
<i>I...</i>

07:53.573 --> 07:55.200
<i>It's my fault.</i>

08:02.682 --> 08:04.912
I promised Uncle Jack
that I'd look after Becky

08:04.984 --> 08:06.576
when she came
out here from Omaha.

08:07.387 --> 08:10.550
She wants to be a dancer
but she's never had
any training.

08:10.857 --> 08:13.951
Well, maybe she got lucky
and landed a tour

08:14.027 --> 08:16.587
and forgot to let you
know about it.

08:17.163 --> 08:19.996
Forgot to tell me that
she was leaving town
for two whole months?

08:20.066 --> 08:21.761
Oh, come on. She is 17.
No.

08:21.834 --> 08:23.825
And then maybe she tried
to reach you and...

08:23.903 --> 08:25.768
And I was too busy, right?

08:26.339 --> 08:29.035
No, now that's not
what I meant.
Well, I was busy.

08:29.108 --> 08:31.269
And I did take
too much for granted.

08:31.377 --> 08:33.902
Look, I think you're being
a little hard on yourself.

08:33.980 --> 08:36.813
I should've looked
into her friends
like Uncle Jack warned me.

08:36.883 --> 08:40.182
He wanted me to keep her
away from what he calls
"beach bums."

08:40.253 --> 08:44.280
Yeah, well somehow I think
I got elected president
of that club this morning.

08:44.390 --> 08:46.881
No, Thomas.
He didn't mean it that way.

08:49.195 --> 08:52.392
He's just so
very old school.

08:52.732 --> 08:54.791
He probably looked
at your lifestyle,

08:54.867 --> 08:56.858
or what he presumed
to be your lifestyle,

08:56.936 --> 08:59.029
and he overreacted.

08:59.605 --> 09:02.472
Well, if he's that rigid
with Becky, no wonder
they don't get along.

09:02.542 --> 09:05.340
That's right.
We can see that,
but he can't.

09:06.012 --> 09:08.276
He absolutely
worships her, Thomas.

09:08.614 --> 09:11.208
I don't know. What am I
gonna do if something's
happened to her?

09:11.284 --> 09:14.811
Well, don't you think
we could consider some less
drastic possibilities?

09:14.887 --> 09:16.946
I mean, besides,
the police are investigating.

09:17.023 --> 09:18.923
Is that the best
I get from you?

09:18.991 --> 09:21.721
They have a hundred
teenagers to find.
I just want one.

09:21.794 --> 09:24.786
And I expected you
to care as much as...
Come on.

09:24.864 --> 09:27.389
Come on, now.
I think you are overreacting.

09:27.834 --> 09:31.531
Besides, if it was that
important, you would've
come to me a long time ago.

09:31.604 --> 09:35.597
But, Thomas, I didn't start
worrying soon enough.
Don't you understand?

09:35.675 --> 09:38.041
Well, what about her father?
Wasn't he concerned?

09:38.111 --> 09:40.511
He didn't know
until I called him.

09:40.613 --> 09:41.978
They had this bargain

09:42.048 --> 09:45.347
that if Becky agreed
to come here instead of
going to LA or New York,

09:45.418 --> 09:47.443
then her father was
not to phone her.

09:47.520 --> 09:50.216
When there was contact,
she would be the first one
to make it.

09:50.289 --> 09:52.120
And that was okay because...

09:52.191 --> 09:55.820
Because good old
Cousin Carol was
going to look after her.

09:58.765 --> 10:01.131
Whatever happens,
I tell you, I have
learned one thing.

10:01.200 --> 10:02.827
I'm gonna forget
about being a parent

10:02.902 --> 10:05.063
because I don't think
I can handle
the responsibility.

10:05.138 --> 10:06.765
Hey, come on.

10:07.173 --> 10:09.403
And you're just upset.
Everything's gonna be okay.

10:09.475 --> 10:12.740
Oh, Thomas, I think
it goes a little
beyond that, don't you?

10:12.912 --> 10:15.403
I mean,
she could be in trouble.
She could be hurt.

10:15.481 --> 10:17.506
She could be dead
for all we know.

10:19.752 --> 10:22.118
I'm scared, Thomas.
I need your help.

10:29.528 --> 10:32.861
<i>Runaway teenagers</i>
<i>are the private investigator's</i>
<i>nightmare.</i>

10:32.932 --> 10:34.957
<i>They're shrewd enough</i>
<i>to stay lost,</i>

10:35.034 --> 10:37.059
<i>scared enough</i>
<i>to want to be found,</i>

10:37.136 --> 10:39.798
<i>and young enough not to leave</i>
<i>much history to research.</i>

10:58.124 --> 11:02.185
<i>She hadn't danced at</i>
<i>any of the hotel lounges</i>
<i>or exotic clubs in town</i>

11:02.261 --> 11:04.786
<i>and she wasn't listed</i>
<i>with a talent agency.</i>

11:05.031 --> 11:08.762
<i>I had to hope</i>
<i>that she used the term</i>
<i>"dancing" very loosely.</i>

11:08.868 --> 11:11.632
5, 6, 7, 8.

11:11.704 --> 11:14.867
Okay, lift them up,
kick them up, pick them up.
Come on, kids.

11:14.940 --> 11:17.875
Flap them up.
Squawk as you turn.
Squawk as you turn.

11:17.943 --> 11:20.707
<i>It's your birthday</i>
<i>and I'd just like to say</i>

11:20.780 --> 11:24.307
<i>What's wrong with being</i>
<i>grey and wrinkled anyway?</i>

11:24.583 --> 11:27.814
<i>You're all awaiting 40</i>

11:27.887 --> 11:30.549
<i>But don't fight time,</i>

11:30.623 --> 11:32.386
Lance,
will you quit the yelling?

11:32.458 --> 11:34.119
People are trying
to concentrate.

11:35.461 --> 11:37.861
Okay. You got a résumé?

11:38.030 --> 11:40.157
Never mind. I need
a gorilla this afternoon.

11:40.232 --> 11:42.223
You're a little tall,
but I think you can do it.

11:42.301 --> 11:44.735
You don't understand.
I'm not here for work.

11:44.804 --> 11:47.671
Yeah, that's what Larry Fenner
said on short notice.

11:47.740 --> 11:50.504
Well, excuse me.
I'm late for his party gig.

11:50.576 --> 11:52.567
This will just take a second.
I'm Thomas Magnum.

11:52.645 --> 11:54.738
I'm a private investigator.
She's a dancer.

11:55.047 --> 11:56.412
Not really.

11:59.185 --> 12:01.312
Nice kid, though.
So she works here?

12:01.387 --> 12:03.412
Becky Damon.
Right. Yeah.

12:03.489 --> 12:06.083
Until a few weeks ago.
Halfway decent DC.

12:06.158 --> 12:07.284
DC?

12:08.060 --> 12:09.152
Dancing Chicken.

12:13.132 --> 12:15.327
Did she leave
a forwarding address?
Anything?

12:15.401 --> 12:16.527
Are you kidding?

12:16.602 --> 12:19.571
She and Darryl left
one morning without notice.
Never came back.

12:19.638 --> 12:21.572
Darryl? Who's Darryl?
Jacobs.

12:21.841 --> 12:24.571
The worst singing dog
I have ever seen.

12:24.810 --> 12:26.801
And less talented
as a human.

12:28.314 --> 12:31.340
And furthermore,
Magnum says that he has
a long police record.

12:31.417 --> 12:33.408
Well, they must know
where he is.

12:33.486 --> 12:34.953
Why don't we just
go talk to him?

12:35.020 --> 12:36.544
Thomas didn't have
time to explain.

12:36.622 --> 12:40.319
He just said that he would
like to meet us here
to discuss the situation.

12:40.392 --> 12:41.882
More discussion.

12:41.961 --> 12:44.293
Look, Carol,
I understand you're
sold on Magnum.

12:44.363 --> 12:47.389
Well, he's come up
with a solid lead
in a matter of hours.

12:47.466 --> 12:49.434
What do you want,
Uncle Jack?

12:50.636 --> 12:52.103
I want my daughter.

12:53.105 --> 12:56.165
And I don't understand
why we have to sit here
having a discussion

12:56.242 --> 12:57.937
when she's out there
somewhere.

13:00.112 --> 13:01.272
Never mind.

13:02.948 --> 13:05.849
I assure you, Magnum
must have good reason.

13:07.553 --> 13:09.145
Would you care
for a sherry?

13:10.022 --> 13:11.148
Sherry, no.

13:12.124 --> 13:14.319
I could care deeply
for a Scotch.

13:14.894 --> 13:16.156
Of course. Carol?

13:16.996 --> 13:18.361
No, thank you.

13:25.304 --> 13:26.794
A dancing chicken.

13:28.374 --> 13:30.808
Why would Becky want to
do something like that?

13:32.611 --> 13:34.238
Maybe it was all
she could find.

13:34.313 --> 13:35.473
Oh, come on.

13:36.382 --> 13:39.476
I mean, I may not
have been 100%% behind
this dancing notion,

13:39.552 --> 13:42.612
but even I have to admit
she's more talented than that.

13:42.788 --> 13:44.221
Hey, she's good.

13:45.324 --> 13:46.757
She's very good.

13:47.126 --> 13:49.060
Thank you.
You're quite welcome.

13:49.128 --> 13:51.653
What's the name
of that musical?

13:55.100 --> 13:57.159
No, <i>South Pacific.</i>
Exactly.

13:58.437 --> 14:00.701
Senior class did
that last year.

14:00.940 --> 14:03.067
Becky played
one of the nurses.
Just a small part.

14:03.142 --> 14:04.541
She just had a few lines.

14:04.610 --> 14:06.771
She blew everybody
off the stage.

14:09.381 --> 14:11.906
I sound like one of those
proud parents, don't I?

14:11.984 --> 14:14.885
I am. I am proud.
She's terrific.

14:19.425 --> 14:22.553
After her mother died,
I went to all her recitals.

14:22.628 --> 14:24.823
I tried to encourage her. I...

14:26.332 --> 14:28.800
I don't know. I guess
I said the wrong things.

14:29.335 --> 14:31.496
I just didn't seem
to register.

14:32.404 --> 14:34.565
I do know that
this doesn't add up.

14:35.407 --> 14:37.568
I mean, Becky's just
too talented to be

14:37.643 --> 14:39.770
jumping around
in a damn chicken suit.

14:39.845 --> 14:43.474
And I still don't believe
she'd date somebody
like this Jacobs.

14:44.083 --> 14:46.142
I'm afraid
it's true, Mr. Damon.

14:49.688 --> 14:52.816
And I'm afraid
it's a little more involved
than just dating.

14:54.126 --> 14:56.390
He was living with her
for a while.

14:56.462 --> 14:57.622
I'm sorry.

14:59.131 --> 15:01.565
Any information about
his current whereabouts?

15:02.835 --> 15:05.133
Yes. Oahu Prison Farm.

15:05.204 --> 15:07.729
And it's gonna be very tough
to get anything out of him.

15:08.941 --> 15:11.034
Well, why don't
we go talk to him?

15:11.110 --> 15:12.975
Find out what he knows
about Becky.

15:13.045 --> 15:15.411
Look, the police
already questioned him.

15:16.015 --> 15:19.007
He claims he never knew
Becky Damon.

15:28.441 --> 15:31.205
You sure there isn't
a simpler way of doing this?

15:31.278 --> 15:33.041
T. C: Yeah, it all
sounds pretty risky.

15:33.113 --> 15:35.946
Come on.
Carol's worked out
all the details.

15:36.016 --> 15:38.348
It'll just be
a couple of days.
No big deal.

15:38.418 --> 15:40.283
It's a bigger deal
than you think, Thomas.

15:40.353 --> 15:42.719
These guys are tough,
and they got nothing to lose.
You remember that.

15:42.789 --> 15:44.689
Oh, Rick. It's just
a farm. Thanks.

15:44.758 --> 15:45.986
Yeah. Okay.

15:46.559 --> 15:50.962
But you just listen up.
Rule number one.
Don't make enemies.

15:51.665 --> 15:55.567
No, rule number one.
Just forget about
the whole thing.

15:56.036 --> 15:57.867
Well, I'm inclined to agree.

15:58.972 --> 16:01.304
It's not that
I don't appreciate
what you're trying to do.

16:01.374 --> 16:03.274
I'm trying to find Becky,
Mr. Damon.

16:03.343 --> 16:05.243
I'm trying to do it
as quickly as possible.

16:05.312 --> 16:07.212
Hey, he understands that.
We all do. But...

16:07.280 --> 16:09.840
Fine, if you understand,
just be there to help

16:09.916 --> 16:11.850
if I come up
with something, okay?

16:11.918 --> 16:15.445
Just as long as you don't
come up with something
like a fork in your gut.

16:18.258 --> 16:20.158
Rick, this is
not the movies.

16:21.194 --> 16:24.288
But, what about
the real possibilities?

16:24.431 --> 16:27.161
You know, a record mix up
that could keep you in there.

16:28.068 --> 16:29.695
What if somebody knows you?

16:29.903 --> 16:31.097
That's a very good point.

16:31.171 --> 16:33.162
In your line of work,
you're bound to have run into

16:33.239 --> 16:35.070
a couple of these
outstanding citizens.

16:35.141 --> 16:37.632
No, no. Come on.
I've checked
the entire roster.

16:37.711 --> 16:41.010
I've rechecked it.
They're all short timers,
three to six month terms,

16:41.081 --> 16:42.981
and all their forks
are blunted.

16:46.286 --> 16:49.153
Your answering device
will not be necessary.

16:49.389 --> 16:52.984
I've arranged to have
your calls transferred
to the main house.

16:53.093 --> 16:55.152
Oh, really?
Thanks, Higgins.

16:55.228 --> 16:58.163
Well, it's the least
I can do to help.

16:58.231 --> 17:00.756
Thomas, I have copies
of your conviction papers.

17:00.834 --> 17:02.392
And Judge Peterson's
phone number.

17:02.469 --> 17:04.164
So you call him
if you can't reach me

17:04.237 --> 17:06.262
because he knows
the whole story.

17:07.906 --> 17:10.102
What if something happens
to you and this judge?

17:10.175 --> 17:13.202
Well, then I call Ida Lupino
and tell her I need help.

17:13.579 --> 17:15.980
Listen to this.
I don't understand you.

17:16.049 --> 17:17.846
You think you're going
to a summer camp?

17:17.916 --> 17:20.511
I think I got it
in the right perspective.
It's just a farm.

17:20.587 --> 17:23.385
I'm gonna do
a little manual labor
and watch a lot of TV.

17:23.522 --> 17:26.287
Well, at least
you have experience
in one of the two.

17:32.932 --> 17:34.297
Be careful.

17:37.237 --> 17:40.297
Hey, man. Get to Jacobs
and get out of there quick.

17:42.709 --> 17:44.336
Mr. Magnum?

17:51.718 --> 17:53.185
Hi, guys.

17:54.654 --> 17:55.780
Bye, guys.

18:28.087 --> 18:30.453
<i>Okay, so maybe</i>
<i>the whole experience</i>

18:30.523 --> 18:33.253
<i>was having a little</i>
<i>more effect on me</i>
<i>than I'd expected.</i>

18:34.160 --> 18:38.654
<i>What I guess I hadn't</i>
<i>considered was that</i>
<i>feeling of claustrophobia.</i>

18:38.731 --> 18:42.565
<i>Not the kind you get</i>
<i>in elevators and airplanes</i>
<i>and small places,</i>

18:42.635 --> 18:45.035
<i>but the kind I felt</i>
<i>in high school,</i>

18:45.104 --> 18:48.073
<i>the IRS office</i>
<i>and sometimes with Higgins.</i>

18:48.174 --> 18:51.507
<i>Those situations</i>
<i>where other people</i>
<i>were making my rules,</i>

18:51.578 --> 18:53.978
<i>where I had absolutely</i>
<i>no control.</i>

18:57.817 --> 18:59.512
Lunch!

19:06.559 --> 19:10.120
<i>Somebody was getting paid</i>
<i>to plan every hour of my day.</i>

19:10.363 --> 19:12.797
<i>I wanted to find Jacobs fast.</i>

19:13.099 --> 19:15.329
<i>The quicker I could</i>
<i>get to planning</i>
<i>my own time for free,</i>

19:15.401 --> 19:16.993
<i>the better I'd like it.</i>

19:19.072 --> 19:20.403
All right, Dave.

19:20.974 --> 19:22.373
Lunch, man.

19:24.777 --> 19:27.712
Come on.
Bring it down here.

19:35.088 --> 19:37.556
<i>Hey, kitchen detail</i>
<i>beats working</i>
<i>in the sun all day.</i>

19:38.458 --> 19:40.756
No, I told you
it's because of my hand.

19:41.027 --> 19:43.552
I've got them convinced
I can't even hold a hoe.

19:45.265 --> 19:46.698
You coming Sunday?

19:48.568 --> 19:49.796
Why not?

19:51.604 --> 19:53.401
Well, listen, if there's...

19:55.341 --> 19:56.467
Just waiting.

19:57.343 --> 19:59.038
Let me call you
right back, okay?

19:59.546 --> 20:01.605
No, just a guy waiting
to use the phone.

20:02.048 --> 20:03.174
Okay, bye.

20:04.350 --> 20:05.942
Thanks. Won't be long.

20:20.833 --> 20:22.266
Go ahead.
I got a busy.

20:36.349 --> 20:38.544
Oh, I'm just waiting.
Take your time.

20:38.618 --> 20:40.779
I intend to.
In private.

20:40.853 --> 20:42.252
There's another phone
in the hall.

20:42.322 --> 20:43.380
Oh, yeah?

20:45.925 --> 20:46.949
Diana.

20:47.060 --> 20:48.049
T. C: <i>Diana who?</i>

20:48.227 --> 20:49.717
Thomas didn't get
a last name,

20:49.796 --> 20:52.697
but he watched him dial
this number and I
double-checked the address.

20:53.132 --> 20:55.896
So we're doing this
just because
she knows the guy?

20:55.969 --> 20:58.403
Rick, I can't even look
in the window of this place,

20:58.471 --> 21:00.166
let alone...
Oh, don't worry about it.

21:00.239 --> 21:02.207
Now, will you go along
with the plan?

21:02.275 --> 21:05.403
Yeah. You're here
to buy a gift.

21:16.189 --> 21:17.656
She's
a real shy girl.

21:17.790 --> 21:19.519
Oh, yeah?
What's her name?

21:19.592 --> 21:20.991
T. C: Debbie.
Wanda.

21:23.896 --> 21:26.194
Debbie's the one that
told us to ask for you,

21:26.265 --> 21:29.666
and Wanda's the one
he's buying the gift for.
They're both shy.

21:30.136 --> 21:31.262
Okay.

21:32.071 --> 21:33.504
How's red?

21:36.175 --> 21:39.508
Well, Wanda's a lot more
shier than that.

21:40.747 --> 21:42.942
Well, we have
something shier. White.

21:45.218 --> 21:47.118
Is it nice and shy?

21:48.287 --> 21:49.276
Yeah.

21:51.491 --> 21:54.187
Don't you think
maybe you got a shy rack?
I mean...

21:54.260 --> 21:57.286
A shy rack with something
that's a solid material?

21:57.830 --> 21:58.956
Sure.

22:01.567 --> 22:03.967
Well, now this is just
about as shy as we get.

22:04.237 --> 22:05.226
It is?

22:07.473 --> 22:10.931
Boys, make up your mind.
I'm here all alone.
I got a lot of work to do.

22:14.047 --> 22:16.447
Yeah, well, I guess
this is shy enough,

22:16.516 --> 22:17.949
and it's even
a little coy, huh?

22:18.017 --> 22:19.211
I'll put it on.

22:24.123 --> 22:25.454
T.C.

22:26.526 --> 22:27.618
Come here.

22:31.064 --> 22:32.156
The office.

22:32.265 --> 22:35.098
This is crazy.
Exactly what am I supposed
to be looking for?

22:35.168 --> 22:38.934
Look for a phone number,
an address, anything
with Jacobs' name on it.

22:39.005 --> 22:40.905
Go on, use
your imagination.

22:41.574 --> 22:44.975
But for God sakes,
don't leave me here too long.
I'm not using mine.

22:46.546 --> 22:47.706
Go on.

23:08.267 --> 23:09.666
Where's your friend?

23:09.769 --> 23:13.102
He went down the street
to look at some flannel gowns.

23:16.409 --> 23:17.740
You buying this or not?

23:18.244 --> 23:21.543
I'm not sure.
I mean, could you
turn profile?

23:21.681 --> 23:25.640
How's that?
It's okay, but could
I see the other profile?

23:25.718 --> 23:27.310
It looks the same
from both sides.

23:27.386 --> 23:31.345
Yeah, but Wanda doesn't,
so would you just turn
and please hurry!

23:31.424 --> 23:33.551
Hey, don't be
ordering me around.

23:33.626 --> 23:35.890
Why are you yelling?
Yelling?
I'm not yelling.

23:35.962 --> 23:40.331
Fine. Now you've
seen both sides.
Buy it or forget it.

23:40.399 --> 23:43.391
I sure wish T.C. Was
here to help me decide.

23:43.469 --> 23:45.266
Psst, T.C.

23:46.472 --> 23:48.633
Jack,
what are you doing here?

23:50.176 --> 23:52.144
Look, I followed you.

23:52.211 --> 23:54.736
I know Magnum's
got you working on
some kind of a lead.

23:54.814 --> 23:56.748
Who's more involved
in this thing than I am?

23:56.816 --> 23:58.443
I got to do something.

23:59.585 --> 24:01.576
I'm sure my friend
will be back by then.

24:01.654 --> 24:03.485
What's that?
Where'd you get this?

24:03.556 --> 24:05.285
No, no, Jack, don't...
Okay.

24:05.358 --> 24:07.417
Wait a minute. Jack, no.
All right, okay.

24:07.493 --> 24:10.485
Terrific. Wrap it up
but take your time.
All right. Yeah, sure.

24:10.563 --> 24:12.554
What's going on?
What're you doing
with my purse?

24:12.632 --> 24:14.566
Your purse?
Yours, is it?

24:14.634 --> 24:18.468
"RJD." Rebecca Jane Damon.
That's my daughter.

24:18.538 --> 24:20.972
I gave this to her
for Christmas.
Where did you get it?

24:21.040 --> 24:23.065
Where's Becky?
Oh, wait a minute, Jack.
Take it easy.

24:23.142 --> 24:25.167
No, well, forget it!
I'll let the police handle it.

24:25.244 --> 24:27.109
Wait, wait.
You're gonna call who?

24:27.180 --> 24:28.807
The police.
No, no.

24:28.881 --> 24:30.872
Not until we get Thomas
out of the joint.

24:30.950 --> 24:33.145
T.C., this has nothing
to do with him.
Oh, yeah?

24:33.219 --> 24:36.382
What if she gets picked up
and Rick and I are implicated?

24:36.455 --> 24:40.118
That could tie Thomas in.
And what happens
if Jacobs finds out?

24:40.560 --> 24:42.528
Well, what are we gonna do,
just let her take off?

24:42.595 --> 24:44.062
We're not even gonna
question her?

24:44.130 --> 24:45.290
T.C.

24:46.265 --> 24:47.823
She's gone.

24:48.167 --> 24:51.398
She made it to her car.
No license plates.

24:52.104 --> 24:53.571
And no ID in the purse?

24:53.639 --> 24:55.300
<i>All that was in there</i>
<i>was a compact,</i>

24:55.374 --> 24:58.309
a few bucks, the prison
pay phone number and a gun.

24:59.579 --> 25:00.671
A Makarov.

25:01.480 --> 25:03.209
You're kidding. Any ammo?

25:03.516 --> 25:04.915
<i>There was plenty.</i>

25:05.551 --> 25:09.214
What would a lingerie model
be doing with a loaded
Soviet automatic?

25:09.388 --> 25:11.822
I don't know, but if Jacobs
gave her the stuff,

25:11.891 --> 25:13.688
she may have already
have called him.

25:13.759 --> 25:16.125
Now, look,
if I were you, I'd be
careful of what you say.

25:16.229 --> 25:19.198
Don't lie to me.
Listen, can you check
with Ice Pick?

25:20.132 --> 25:21.394
Ice Pick? What?

25:21.467 --> 25:23.662
Jacobs is in for
illegal weapons possession.

25:23.736 --> 25:25.033
Now, I don't know what he had,

25:25.104 --> 25:26.969
but I'm gonna
try and find out.
I got to go.

25:27.039 --> 25:29.507
I told you, Craft.
It was there when we sat down.

25:29.575 --> 25:32.772
It's still cold.
Now, which one of you guys
has got the bourbon?

25:32.845 --> 25:33.971
Me.

25:35.481 --> 25:36.846
Is something wrong?

25:36.916 --> 25:39.441
I mean,
I think that's my drink
you're holding.

25:39.719 --> 25:42.813
I set it on the table
when I went to make
a phone call.

25:45.691 --> 25:48.660
Oh, wait a minute.
It's against the rules
to use alcohol?

25:49.295 --> 25:52.458
Well, I'm sorry,
I'm new here.
I didn't know.

25:54.867 --> 25:56.334
He knew
you were lying.

25:56.402 --> 25:58.870
What did he say
when you couldn't come up
with the empty bottle?

25:58.938 --> 26:02.305
Oh, I did. I gave him
the one that you threw
in the trash can.

26:03.142 --> 26:04.507
What do you want?

26:04.577 --> 26:06.738
Just for you to do the same
thing for me sometime.

26:06.812 --> 26:08.746
Isn't that the way
thing's work in here?

26:09.148 --> 26:10.843
You do a real
nice dumb act.

26:10.917 --> 26:12.111
But what do you
want from me?

26:12.184 --> 26:14.175
Hey, look, I thought I was
doing you a favor, okay?

26:14.253 --> 26:15.652
Forget it.
It won't happen again.

26:15.721 --> 26:17.746
Wait, wait. Wait a minute.
Now, just take it easy.

26:17.823 --> 26:20.724
I just don't know why
you really did it. Thanks.

26:22.094 --> 26:24.460
Is that why you're here,
for doing favors for people?

26:24.530 --> 26:25.690
Yeah.

26:26.499 --> 26:28.990
Contributing to
the delinquency of a minor.

26:29.235 --> 26:33.467
I got...
I bought an underage girl
a couple of six packs of beer.

26:35.207 --> 26:37.175
Are you kidding,
just for buying?

26:37.243 --> 26:40.770
Well, for buying
and going back to
the motel room

26:41.213 --> 26:44.876
and spending half the night
helping her drink it.
I thought she was 22 or 23.

26:44.951 --> 26:46.919
Right. That's what
they want you to think.

26:46.986 --> 26:49.011
Yeah. Sounds like
you've been there.

26:49.588 --> 26:52.250
Look, I'm sorry
if I was wrong
about you watching me.

26:52.325 --> 26:53.986
It just seemed that way.

26:56.979 --> 26:58.446
It's all right. Sorry.

26:58.514 --> 26:59.879
Just an accident.

27:01.250 --> 27:04.219
We're gonna play a little
five card later on.
You want to get in?

27:05.254 --> 27:06.482
No gambling, right?

27:06.555 --> 27:10.321
No. We keep the pot
totaled in our head.

27:10.392 --> 27:12.292
We don't even have
matches on the table.

27:13.129 --> 27:14.687
Say about 8:00
in the lounge?

27:14.763 --> 27:16.094
Right. That's fine.
Okay.

27:16.165 --> 27:18.133
Hey, got a light?
No. I...

27:22.171 --> 27:25.402
And you thought
I was in maximum,
huh, Magnum?

27:25.474 --> 27:27.032
What the hell's going on?

27:27.109 --> 27:28.599
Ask your buddy here.

27:28.978 --> 27:33.039
He's the private investigator
and the reason I'm in jail.

27:45.408 --> 27:46.739
What happened?

27:52.082 --> 27:54.880
I was looking
for the bathroom.

27:54.985 --> 27:56.543
Then I came in here
by mistake

27:56.620 --> 27:59.748
and I must've stumbled
over something.
See, I'm...

27:59.823 --> 28:00.915
Right.

28:00.991 --> 28:03.118
Report to the infirmary.
Spend the night.

28:03.193 --> 28:04.490
I'm fine.

28:04.561 --> 28:07.223
I didn't ask you how you felt.
I said go to the infirmary.

28:07.297 --> 28:09.060
I don't know where it is.

28:09.132 --> 28:10.690
See, I'm new here.

28:11.334 --> 28:12.596
I'll show him.

28:13.970 --> 28:15.460
Repaying your debts?

28:15.539 --> 28:17.507
No, just coming from dinner.

28:17.908 --> 28:20.741
You tell the nurse
to keep him there
till morning.

28:26.249 --> 28:27.648
What's going on?

28:28.184 --> 28:30.277
Did you call the guards?
Yeah.

28:30.353 --> 28:32.253
And I want to know
why you're here.

28:32.322 --> 28:35.223
I told you. Contributing to
the delinquency of a minor.

28:35.292 --> 28:37.123
Yeah. Well, I just
heard different.

28:37.193 --> 28:38.251
All right.

28:39.663 --> 28:42.359
I'm a private investigator.
At least I was.

28:44.234 --> 28:46.464
Graham was
a union official.

28:46.603 --> 28:49.572
I found out he was
buying race horses

28:50.540 --> 28:52.735
with stolen pension funds.

28:52.809 --> 28:55.141
How long has he been here
in minimum anyway?

28:55.211 --> 28:58.044
He just transferred in.
Now, who's got you after me?
Nobody.

28:58.114 --> 28:59.513
Will you knock it off?

28:59.583 --> 29:02.746
I know you're watching me.
You're trying to be my buddy.
You're trying to do me favors.

29:02.819 --> 29:04.844
I want to know why
and I want to know now.

29:04.921 --> 29:07.947
I need to get
to the infirmary.
You gonna help me or not?

29:08.024 --> 29:09.753
Sure. Come on.

29:10.060 --> 29:12.460
What, you're no problem now.

29:13.630 --> 29:16.258
By tomorrow,
everybody around here is
gonna know who you are.

29:16.333 --> 29:19.427
And if I were you,
I'd be real, real careful.

29:19.502 --> 29:21.493
Yeah, and what're you
being careful about?

29:21.972 --> 29:23.234
What do you mean?

29:23.473 --> 29:26.237
Yeah, all right. Let's knock
off the bull, okay?

29:27.043 --> 29:28.670
You want to know
why I'm here?

29:30.380 --> 29:33.076
Why'd you tell the police
you didn't know Becky Damon?

29:33.717 --> 29:35.947
Because it's the truth.
Oh, come on.

29:36.219 --> 29:38.050
They talked to
Donnie at Anigrams.

29:38.121 --> 29:40.783
They talked to
Becky's landlady.
They talked to Diana.

29:40.857 --> 29:44.156
Okay, fine, so I knew her.
So what does that prove?
I haven't seen her in months.

29:44.227 --> 29:46.252
Yeah, will she think
it's all right to give her
belongings

29:46.329 --> 29:47.557
to some new girlfriend?

29:48.231 --> 29:50.529
I never gave her personal
belongings to anyone.

29:50.600 --> 29:52.898
Then how did Diana get
Becky's purse?

29:53.903 --> 29:55.063
How'd she what?

29:55.605 --> 29:56.833
Come on.

29:56.906 --> 29:58.999
You wanted to know
why I'm here?
I'm telling you.

29:59.075 --> 30:01.407
Now, Jack Damon wants
to find his daughter.

30:01.478 --> 30:04.311
Either you know
where she is or you don't.
But what are you hiding?

30:04.381 --> 30:05.575
Nothing!

30:06.549 --> 30:09.040
Last time I saw Becky
she was going to New York.

30:10.053 --> 30:12.988
And you could tell
her father from somebody
who really knows...

30:13.056 --> 30:14.250
Shut up!

30:22.499 --> 30:24.296
Just so you know,

30:24.367 --> 30:26.995
as long as I'm here,
I am a problem.

30:29.205 --> 30:31.139
So you better be careful.

30:31.908 --> 30:35.309
The police are pretty close
to finding Becky,
but I'm not giving up on you.

30:42.085 --> 30:44.679
I'm calling Judge Peterson
and getting you out of here.

30:44.754 --> 30:46.813
No, I need
a couple more days.

30:46.890 --> 30:49.586
You are in danger, Thomas.
They could've
killed you last night.

30:49.659 --> 30:53.493
You don't understand.
Jacobs is intimidated
now that he knows who I am.

30:53.563 --> 30:56.361
He doesn't know
what's gonna happen next.
And neither do I.

30:56.433 --> 30:58.333
Well, I can't leave now.

30:59.536 --> 31:01.800
Gee, what happened to you?

31:02.272 --> 31:05.036
An accident.
Did you talk to
Ice Pick, Rick?

31:12.582 --> 31:16.746
Stolen Soviet weapons
with ammo. And with ammo
they're worth a mint.

31:18.888 --> 31:20.480
Ice Pick bought them?

31:21.858 --> 31:23.758
Ice Pick only buys American.

31:23.827 --> 31:25.920
He just heard that
a lot of people
got some calls

31:25.995 --> 31:28.190
in the last couple of
months from the seller.

31:28.264 --> 31:29.356
Jacobs?

31:40.376 --> 31:41.468
A girl.

31:42.812 --> 31:46.111
And if he was interested,
he was to contact Becky
at Anigrams.

31:51.788 --> 31:53.585
I call.
Aces over fives.

31:54.324 --> 31:55.552
Beats me.

31:56.826 --> 31:58.191
Hi, guys.

32:07.203 --> 32:10.468
Oh, Jacobs invited me
to join the game.
Not this one.

32:11.241 --> 32:12.333
Oh, really?

32:12.642 --> 32:14.735
I thought it was
a standing invitation.

32:16.513 --> 32:17.639
Deal me in.

32:19.816 --> 32:21.716
Don't push your luck, Magnum.

32:23.486 --> 32:24.919
What do you want?

32:24.988 --> 32:26.114
A full house.

32:29.926 --> 32:32.326
Just a little joke.

32:32.896 --> 32:35.763
Actually, I came here to
answer everybody's question.

32:35.999 --> 32:37.489
Why I'm after Jacobs.

32:40.670 --> 32:42.297
Oh, now come on.

32:42.372 --> 32:45.170
Come on, guys.
It isn't exactly
a secret anymore.

32:45.241 --> 32:46.640
Anything wild?

32:49.979 --> 32:52.038
I told you everything I know
about Becky, all right?

32:52.115 --> 32:54.015
Yeah, that she went
to New York, right?

32:54.584 --> 32:56.575
What'd she do for money?
Did you help her out?

32:57.187 --> 33:00.122
Yeah, maybe I gave her
a few bucks. I open.

33:00.290 --> 33:03.088
A few bucks? That's great.

33:03.526 --> 33:06.586
I mean, she didn't
get any of her cut
from the gun sale.

33:06.663 --> 33:09.359
'Cause, after all, I mean,
I heard she did all the work,

33:09.432 --> 33:11.093
made all your phone calls.

33:13.336 --> 33:16.897
I'll play these.
But I'll just call.

33:17.841 --> 33:18.899
I'll take two.

33:19.342 --> 33:23.301
Of course, I guess
you figured that the deal
probably sold itself, huh?

33:23.379 --> 33:27.782
I mean, foreign weapons,
no tariffs, no serial
numbers to trace.

33:28.785 --> 33:31.583
Sold by a 17-year-old
dancing chicken.

33:32.355 --> 33:33.720
Dealer takes two.

33:33.790 --> 33:38.227
That's pretty dangerous stuff,
don't you think,
for a young teenage girl?

33:38.494 --> 33:40.655
Especially considering
who might be
in the marketplace.

33:40.730 --> 33:42.061
You know, the FBI.

33:42.265 --> 33:44.893
Not to mention the guys
you stole them from.

33:45.301 --> 33:47.531
I've never been
into selling guns.

33:47.604 --> 33:48.832
No?

33:51.107 --> 33:52.404
That would be crazy.

33:52.475 --> 33:55.535
I mean, for you
to involve your name
in something that risky.

33:56.346 --> 33:59.440
Did Becky even know
that she was selling
those guns for you?

34:07.223 --> 34:09.589
So, now, Graham,
you see how this works,
don't you?

34:09.659 --> 34:13.425
You should've put
all your dirty money
into your kid's bank account.

34:13.963 --> 34:16.898
That way your kid could've
gone to prison instead of you.

34:19.601 --> 34:20.694
I'll call.

34:47.764 --> 34:49.458
Hey! Hey!

34:49.732 --> 34:51.130
Look out!

34:55.304 --> 34:57.865
Hold it! Hold it!

35:00.476 --> 35:03.172
Well, you did it, Magnum.
You scared the hell
out of him.

35:03.246 --> 35:06.147
He spilled the whole story
just to get our help.

35:06.783 --> 35:10.947
The gunrunners
he stole the weapons from,
they ambushed the sale.

35:11.554 --> 35:13.317
He and that girl
both got hit.

35:14.190 --> 35:16.454
Go on. Go after him, Magnum.

35:16.626 --> 35:18.560
Go on, get out of here.

35:18.928 --> 35:21.396
Look, I'm telling you
to take off!

35:21.497 --> 35:25.263
He's on his way to see
some dancer named Holly.
That's all we know.

35:27.537 --> 35:28.765
Thanks.

35:29.072 --> 35:30.198
Thanks?

35:30.740 --> 35:33.300
He let that girl
bleed to death, Magnum.

35:37.180 --> 35:39.671
He's just a little bit
lousier than you are.

36:00.034 --> 36:02.298
Well, will you please
keep trying
every few minutes?

36:02.369 --> 36:04.860
Yes, it's very,
very important.
Thank you.

36:05.606 --> 36:07.301
I can't reach
Allan Peterson anywhere.

36:07.374 --> 36:09.137
I've been leaving
messages all over town.

36:09.210 --> 36:10.507
It's okay, Carol.

36:10.578 --> 36:14.537
Okay? Thomas, if he doesn't
sign some papers
and make some phone calls,

36:14.615 --> 36:17.049
you are as much of
an escaped convict as Jacobs.

36:17.118 --> 36:18.915
Well, isn't there
anybody else
who can sign?

36:18.986 --> 36:21.477
No. I don't have time
to explain it all
to another judge.

36:21.555 --> 36:23.352
I just have to
find Allan fast.

36:27.228 --> 36:28.855
Higgins doesn't knock.

36:29.597 --> 36:31.087
Stay over there.

36:32.733 --> 36:33.927
Come in.

36:34.935 --> 36:38.132
Hi, Uncle Jack.
I just heard about
the break on the radio.

36:38.205 --> 36:41.402
What happened? Why?
What pushed him to it?

36:45.813 --> 36:48.805
If he knows where Becky is,
she's in real danger,
isn't she?

36:48.883 --> 36:52.182
Look, I don't know
anything for sure,
and if I did, I'd tell you.

36:54.522 --> 36:57.320
Listen, I want to thank you
for all you've done,

36:57.758 --> 36:59.589
what you've been through.

37:00.161 --> 37:02.652
I know I didn't make it
any easier.

37:03.364 --> 37:06.060
Mr. Damon, if you hadn't
recognized that purse...

37:09.103 --> 37:12.300
Is that purse in any way
special to Becky?

37:14.575 --> 37:18.477
I'd like to think that
it was, but I don't know.
Probably not.

37:19.046 --> 37:21.276
Well, I never saw her
without it. Why?

37:23.284 --> 37:27.345
I was just wondering if Becky
gave that purse to Diana.

37:27.421 --> 37:31.380
I mean, Jacobs said he didn't.
And from the way he reacted
when I told him,

37:31.659 --> 37:33.286
I tend to believe him.

37:34.662 --> 37:37.859
Well, how would Becky ever
know this Franklin woman?

37:38.465 --> 37:40.456
Well, why not?
Jacobs knew both of them.

37:40.534 --> 37:43.503
There's no reason
why they shouldn't have known
each other. It's just...

37:43.571 --> 37:46.301
Something about this
whole purse thing,

37:46.373 --> 37:48.364
something about the way
it threw him. It just...

37:49.944 --> 37:51.434
Threw me, too.

37:54.481 --> 37:58.042
Look, you did a lot of work.
I'd like to pay you.

38:03.457 --> 38:07.951
Well, Uncle Jack,
will you please stop talking
in the past tense?

38:08.028 --> 38:09.928
I mean, what's going
on here anyway?

38:09.997 --> 38:12.192
Are we all of a sudden
just writing Becky off?

38:13.834 --> 38:15.699
No. Come on.

38:16.203 --> 38:18.694
I told you, I'm not sure
of anything yet.

38:19.373 --> 38:20.601
I am.

38:23.777 --> 38:24.903
I miss her.

38:30.117 --> 38:31.914
Magnum,
the police called again.

38:31.986 --> 38:33.385
This time
I can't dissuade them.

38:33.454 --> 38:35.684
They demand on searching
the estate for you.

38:35.756 --> 38:38.224
Thomas, I can't stop them.
They'll take you back.

38:41.161 --> 38:43.686
Yes? Oh, hi.

38:43.864 --> 38:45.764
Yeah, yeah, just a minute.

38:46.900 --> 38:48.026
Rick?

38:48.102 --> 38:51.560
Oh, T.C., Rick's
watching the floorshow.

38:51.839 --> 38:54.967
One bad dancer
and a lot of roaches.

38:55.042 --> 38:56.475
Man, this place
is the pits.

38:56.543 --> 38:58.170
What place, T. C?

38:58.479 --> 39:01.880
The Foxshop.
Star attraction,
Holly Berry.

39:01.982 --> 39:04.177
Believe it or not,
that's her name.
She's a stripper.

39:04.618 --> 39:06.779
What makes you think
she's the right girl?

39:07.354 --> 39:10.255
<i>Oh, we recognized her.</i>
<i>The manager showed us</i>
<i>some pictures.</i>

39:10.891 --> 39:13.359
None other than
Diana Franklin.

39:13.427 --> 39:15.224
She started here
a couple of nights ago.

39:15.396 --> 39:16.385
Is she there now?

39:17.931 --> 39:20.559
No. Her first
show's at 5:00.

39:20.968 --> 39:22.162
Look, T.C.,

39:22.236 --> 39:24.898
you and Rick better get out
of there before she shows up
and recognizes you.

39:24.972 --> 39:26.405
<i>Gladly.</i>

39:27.374 --> 39:30.172
Mr. Damon,
where's that purse?

39:30.811 --> 39:33.746
Thomas, you can't go anywhere.
You'll be arrested.

39:34.481 --> 39:37.279
I know that
and I'm going down
into the wine cellar.

39:37.985 --> 39:40.351
Till I get my next call
from The Foxshop.

40:28.936 --> 40:30.528
What can I do for you?

40:31.538 --> 40:33.199
Why sure, sugar.

41:21.588 --> 41:24.284
I think you just bought me
a very expensive drink.

41:27.094 --> 41:29.426
I believe you dropped this.

41:30.497 --> 41:33.762
Expendable merchandise.
Keep it.

41:37.204 --> 41:38.501
Miss Berry.

41:39.907 --> 41:42.034
Surely, that's not
your real name.

41:42.109 --> 41:44.134
Surely, it doesn't matter.

41:46.313 --> 41:49.476
It matters a great deal,
Miss Franklin.

41:49.550 --> 41:52.110
Please don't.
All exits are guarded.

41:53.887 --> 41:55.218
Police?
No.

41:55.589 --> 41:57.454
Are you telling me
Darryl sent you?

41:57.925 --> 41:59.916
Darryl Jacobs.
Where is he?

42:00.227 --> 42:02.127
I don't know
and I don't care.

42:02.196 --> 42:04.187
I just don't want him
to find me.

42:04.498 --> 42:07.092
Look, I haven't even been
home since he broke out.

42:07.167 --> 42:09.397
Where is Becky,
Miss Franklin?

42:10.471 --> 42:13.668
If you want Becky and Darryl,
there's only one way.

42:13.841 --> 42:15.934
Where is Becky? Please.

42:16.009 --> 42:17.135
My way.

42:19.313 --> 42:21.144
How do I know
I can trust you?

42:22.249 --> 42:26.015
Well, I was about to ask
the same question,
but I don't have a choice.

42:26.086 --> 42:29.283
I want Darryl caught.
You seem like my best shot.

42:35.963 --> 42:37.988
I believe there's
a phone here.

42:40.601 --> 42:41.590
Yes.

43:28.515 --> 43:29.777
Hi, Darryl.

43:30.684 --> 43:32.311
Yeah, hiya, Darryl.

43:38.025 --> 43:40.892
We kind of thought
you'd get a big kick
out of this.

43:44.364 --> 43:45.626
You set me up.

43:47.601 --> 43:50.536
Why not? The kid was
practically dead
when she got to my place.

43:50.604 --> 43:52.469
I've been hiding her
ever since.

43:52.539 --> 43:54.803
You really did think
she'd still be here,
didn't you?

43:54.875 --> 43:56.399
Just like you left her.

43:59.413 --> 44:01.779
Becky, please,
I didn't have a choice.

44:02.649 --> 44:04.310
I couldn't bring you
to the hospital.

44:04.384 --> 44:06.477
I would've had to
give them an explanation.

44:07.120 --> 44:10.556
Sorry I made it back
to Diana's and messed
your plans up.

44:11.124 --> 44:14.685
Now, don't be crazy.
I'm happy as hell that
you're alive, honey.

44:14.995 --> 44:17.828
Yeah, that's right.
Now you're only guilty
of attempted murder.

44:18.765 --> 44:19.857
Attempt...

44:27.074 --> 44:28.632
I was scared, Becky.

44:28.709 --> 44:31.473
Yeah, so was I.

44:33.080 --> 44:37.039
Begging the man that you love
not to leave you, and him just
yelling at you to shut up!

44:38.852 --> 44:40.820
Covering up the car.

44:43.957 --> 44:45.083
Scary.

44:53.767 --> 44:57.100
And shuffle, ball change,
and hitch, kick, cluck.

44:57.170 --> 45:00.230
And shuffle, ball change,
and hitch, kick, cluck,

45:00.307 --> 45:05.677
and tour jeté, and tour jeté
and cluck, cluck, cluck.

45:07.848 --> 45:09.440
Why don't you guys
take five?

45:11.485 --> 45:12.611
Hi.

45:13.920 --> 45:15.353
You teaching now?

45:16.356 --> 45:19.416
Donnie's letting me
do this till he has
a performing job for me.

45:21.595 --> 45:22.857
What's going on?

45:23.497 --> 45:24.486
Becky.

45:25.332 --> 45:26.731
Your father's still here.

45:28.702 --> 45:29.760
Why?

45:31.438 --> 45:33.565
We said our goodbyes
two days ago.

45:35.442 --> 45:38.673
He agreed that nothing
has changed about
my being on my own.

45:42.616 --> 45:45.983
A lot has changed.
I think you're gonna need
all the support you can get.

45:47.354 --> 45:49.652
Carol has news
about my problem?

45:51.191 --> 45:54.388
At least let your dad become
a part of what's going on.

45:57.164 --> 46:00.497
Tell him
I'll call him tonight.

46:01.034 --> 46:02.160
No.

46:04.871 --> 46:06.736
I think you should
talk to him now.

46:10.844 --> 46:13.404
I just got word, Becky,
and it's pretty serious.

46:13.480 --> 46:15.641
You are going to be
formally charged.

46:18.819 --> 46:20.548
You can't take care of it?

46:22.522 --> 46:23.648
No.

46:24.124 --> 46:25.591
On your own, right?

46:31.531 --> 46:34.500
I decided to stick around
in case you need something.

46:36.069 --> 46:38.094
Do I have to go somewhere now?

46:39.139 --> 46:40.128
Tomorrow.

46:42.509 --> 46:43.498
Yeah.

46:46.747 --> 46:48.738
I got to get back to work.

46:56.256 --> 46:57.848
Do you have lunch plans?

46:59.326 --> 47:01.794
Me? No.

47:05.966 --> 47:07.263
Me either.

47:14.508 --> 47:17.068
Are you going to be
staying here for a while?

47:18.512 --> 47:20.537
Just try and stop me.

47:20.614 --> 47:23.208
And shuffle, ball change,
and hitch, kick, cluck.

47:23.283 --> 47:26.116
And shuffle, ball change,
and hitch, kick, cluck.

47:26.419 --> 47:29.479
And tour jeté
and tour jeté,

47:29.556 --> 47:31.922
and cluck, cluck, cluck.

47:31.992 --> 47:33.983
Jack, she's gonna be okay.

47:35.362 --> 47:36.420
Okay?

47:37.564 --> 47:38.724
Look at her.

47:40.367 --> 47:41.800
She's terrific.

47:41.868 --> 47:43.893
And cluck,
cluck, cluck.
