00:05.547 --> 00:07.379
Madeline Burke...

00:07.466 --> 00:08.466
you're under arrest.

00:09.676 --> 00:11.133
Jane, where are you?

00:11.220 --> 00:12.280
<i>I'll meet you in the lobby.</i>

00:22.731 --> 00:24.267
Come on...

00:24.358 --> 00:25.974
where are ya?

00:26.068 --> 00:27.900
Wait, I got him!

00:30.155 --> 00:32.008
How much you wanna bet
that's Jane under the sheet?

00:32.031 --> 00:34.615
Okay, I pulled a photo of
Dominic from Zapata's files.

00:34.701 --> 00:35.942
That's for sure him.

00:36.036 --> 00:37.117
You got anything cleaner?

00:37.204 --> 00:39.571
No, the security system
is super basic.

00:39.665 --> 00:40.850
Standard def,
tons of blind spots.

00:40.874 --> 00:42.081
We never see him grab her.

00:42.167 --> 00:43.954
I'm not even sure
she's alive under there.

00:44.044 --> 00:45.647
Madeline's not talking,
and you're not gonna

00:45.671 --> 00:47.551
want to leave Weller
alone with her much longer.

00:47.589 --> 00:49.421
All right, send
the footage to my tablet.

00:49.508 --> 00:52.125
Keep track of Dominic.
He's the only lead we have.

00:52.219 --> 00:53.630
Just tell me where she is!

00:53.720 --> 00:54.961
I see how upset you are,

00:55.055 --> 00:56.546
and I want to help you
find your wife.

00:56.640 --> 00:58.427
Believe me,
if something like this

00:58.517 --> 00:59.883
had happened
to my late husband...

00:59.977 --> 01:01.138
Where is she?!

01:01.228 --> 01:02.719
I don't know!

01:02.813 --> 01:03.974
I wish I did.

01:05.941 --> 01:08.308
This is hospital
surveillance video

01:08.402 --> 01:12.112
showing your security consultant
Dominic Masters

01:12.197 --> 01:13.938
kidnapping Jane Doe.

01:14.032 --> 01:15.864
Your agent
with the tattoos?

01:16.952 --> 01:18.944
I... I... I don't
see her in that video.

01:19.037 --> 01:21.245
She's on the gurney,
under the sheet.

01:21.331 --> 01:23.664
There's no way of
knowing that for sure.

01:23.750 --> 01:26.117
Do you really think that
we're that stupid?

01:26.211 --> 01:28.043
Do you want me to
answer that on camera?

01:28.130 --> 01:30.042
Playing dumb only
prolongs the process.

01:30.132 --> 01:31.168
Making things hard on us

01:31.258 --> 01:32.544
only makes
things worse for you.

01:32.634 --> 01:33.736
I am just trying
to be thorough.

01:33.760 --> 01:35.296
I don't see Jane
in that video,

01:35.387 --> 01:36.503
nor do I see Dominic.

01:36.597 --> 01:39.431
I see a man in a hat
with his face obscured.

01:39.516 --> 01:43.601
I am not comfortable making a
positive ID based on that footage.

01:45.564 --> 01:47.351
We know that
that is Dominic.

01:48.191 --> 01:49.191
We know...

01:49.276 --> 01:50.983
that he took Jane.

01:51.069 --> 01:52.901
So where'd he take her?

01:52.988 --> 01:55.105
How could I
possibly know that?

01:55.198 --> 01:56.609
Dominic works for you.

01:56.700 --> 01:58.566
Again, I have to be clear.

01:58.660 --> 01:59.946
A Dominic Masters

02:00.037 --> 02:02.120
was an employee
of HCI Global,

02:02.205 --> 02:03.946
of which I was the CEO,

02:04.041 --> 02:06.408
until you all started freezing
and seizing my assets.

02:06.501 --> 02:08.300
And I'd like to point out
that the FBI has had

02:08.377 --> 02:11.086
a longstanding vendetta
against my family.

02:11.173 --> 02:12.209
If you want to testify,

02:12.299 --> 02:13.460
save it for court, please.

02:13.550 --> 02:15.007
If that is Dominic,

02:15.093 --> 02:16.504
and if, in fact,
he has committed

02:16.595 --> 02:18.552
some egregious act,

02:18.639 --> 02:22.178
I would be happy to help
the FBI clear HCI Global

02:22.267 --> 02:23.974
and myself from any wrongdoing,

02:24.061 --> 02:26.394
as I've done
in the past!

02:26.480 --> 02:27.915
But I'm beginning to feel
that you are all

02:27.939 --> 02:30.226
holding me responsible
for this somehow.

02:30.317 --> 02:33.185
Now, what tipped you off,
Mrs. Burke?

02:34.946 --> 02:37.404
Well, if that's the case...

02:37.491 --> 02:39.153
I won't continue
this conversation

02:39.242 --> 02:40.528
until my lawyer
has arrived.

02:43.622 --> 02:45.363
I will make sure

02:45.457 --> 02:47.540
that you rot in prison.

02:47.626 --> 02:49.663
For the rest of your life.

02:51.129 --> 02:52.620
And I would like
to deal with someone

02:52.714 --> 02:55.923
a little less emotionally
involved in this case.

02:58.804 --> 03:00.670
Agent Zapata, perhaps.

03:02.474 --> 03:04.261
I always liked her.

03:07.771 --> 03:09.228
What do we got?

03:09.314 --> 03:11.180
Dominic stole
an ambulance.

03:11.274 --> 03:13.516
We tracked it to a parking
garage near Barclay Center,

03:13.610 --> 03:16.444
but it looks like he ditched it
and swapped it for another car.

03:16.530 --> 03:18.112
Did anyone report
a stolen vehicle?

03:18.198 --> 03:19.509
Not yet... we've been
trying to tag and track

03:19.533 --> 03:21.900
every car in the garage,
but it's the worst possible timing.

03:21.993 --> 03:23.234
The Islanders game
just got out,

03:23.328 --> 03:24.660
so there's too many cars.

03:24.746 --> 03:26.099
It would take days
to find the right one.

03:26.123 --> 03:28.410
We don't have it...
FAA's ready to reopen the skies.

03:28.500 --> 03:29.707
So call Weitz.

03:29.793 --> 03:31.659
I did, the order's
coming from the top.

03:31.753 --> 03:33.460
We grounded flights
to catch Madeline.

03:33.547 --> 03:34.587
Now that she's in custody,

03:34.631 --> 03:35.917
DOJ can't justify
the cost

03:36.007 --> 03:37.568
of what's basically
a missing persons case.

03:37.592 --> 03:40.380
Even if that missing person
is an FBI agent?

03:40.470 --> 03:41.470
It's not my call.

03:41.555 --> 03:42.762
All right.

03:42.848 --> 03:44.089
Wait, wait!
Hang on, hang on.

03:44.182 --> 03:45.798
What if we foot
the bill ourselves?

03:45.892 --> 03:49.306
I have a bunch of Bitcoin
stashed away somewhere,

03:49.396 --> 03:51.499
and I know you're sitting on some
pretty sweet Wizardville money.

03:51.523 --> 03:52.583
I mean, how much
could this thing cost?

03:52.607 --> 03:53.626
- $15 billion.
- That's it?

03:53.650 --> 03:55.169
Yeah, but last time,
that's just what it cost

03:55.193 --> 03:56.525
to bail out the airlines.

03:56.611 --> 03:57.672
Yeah, but this
is completely different.

03:57.696 --> 03:59.983
That was three days of
nationwide grounded flights.

04:00.073 --> 04:01.801
We're talking about
the early hours of day one,

04:01.825 --> 04:03.316
so divide that cost by three,

04:03.410 --> 04:04.929
and if we only keep
New York's airspace closed,

04:04.953 --> 04:05.972
that's another
50 percent we save.

04:05.996 --> 04:07.407
That's not how
the math works.

04:07.497 --> 04:08.988
Okay, not helping, all right?

04:09.082 --> 04:10.643
Look, I know you don't
like to talk about it,

04:10.667 --> 04:12.347
but you definitely
have some extra millions

04:12.419 --> 04:14.206
sitting around
to spare Jane's life.

04:14.296 --> 04:16.583
Excuse me,
he said billion.

04:16.673 --> 04:18.039
With a "B."

04:18.132 --> 04:19.464
Did you say b...
Did you say...

04:19.551 --> 04:20.951
Oh, I heard million.
That's my pr...

04:21.011 --> 04:22.218
I'm sorry. As you were.

04:22.304 --> 04:23.465
You could have
said something.

04:23.555 --> 04:24.671
I did!

04:24.765 --> 04:26.848
Could have said
something sooner.

04:26.933 --> 04:28.140
I need you
to call Weitz again.

04:28.226 --> 04:29.512
My hands are tied.

04:29.603 --> 04:31.219
If Dominic gets Jane
on a private jet,

04:31.313 --> 04:32.429
we might not see her again.

04:32.522 --> 04:34.479
So what
I'm asking for is...

04:34.566 --> 04:36.335
I've been calling Weitz ever
since we got Madeline in custody.

04:36.359 --> 04:37.600
I have no more wiggle room.

04:37.694 --> 04:39.731
We don't know what
Dominic wants from Jane.

04:39.821 --> 04:41.187
Okay?
So if we can at least

04:41.281 --> 04:42.717
keep the private airfields
grounded...

04:42.741 --> 04:43.982
There you are!

04:45.327 --> 04:47.910
Assistant Director Reade.
Sorry I'm late.

04:47.996 --> 04:49.658
I was on my way to Orlando
with my family,

04:49.748 --> 04:52.081
but my flight was grounded
for an FBI manhunt?

04:52.167 --> 04:54.705
Uh, forgive my attire, I came
straight from the airport.

04:54.795 --> 04:56.752
- What a mess, huh?
- I'm sorry, who...

04:56.838 --> 04:58.374
Please don't apologize.
I get it.

04:58.465 --> 04:59.942
I mean, the kids were
disappointed for sure.

04:59.966 --> 05:01.569
We were doing a whole
Wizarding World thing,

05:01.593 --> 05:04.301
park-to-park passes,
front-of-the-line lanyards,

05:04.387 --> 05:06.049
a hotel on the lot
for early bird access.

05:06.139 --> 05:07.550
Sure, it costs
a little bit more,

05:07.641 --> 05:09.368
but you can't put a price tag
on memories like that.

05:09.392 --> 05:10.553
They're
at that perfect age

05:10.644 --> 05:12.476
where magic is still
very magical.

05:12.562 --> 05:14.123
Oh, let me see if I got
a picture over here.

05:14.147 --> 05:16.264
Ohh!

05:16.358 --> 05:18.520
Damn it, that was
a new phone, too.

05:18.610 --> 05:19.610
Who are you?

05:20.612 --> 05:21.978
Richard Shirley, Esquire.

05:22.072 --> 05:24.689
Shirley, Gervais,
Karlie, Hohua & Cicino.

05:24.783 --> 05:26.194
You're Madeline Burke's
attorney.

05:26.284 --> 05:28.446
Oh, my goodness.

05:28.537 --> 05:31.325
Shirley! Hello!
Bury the lead, why don't you?

05:31.414 --> 05:33.827
Yes, I am Ms. Burke's lawyer,
and I just want to thank y'all

05:33.917 --> 05:35.394
for taking my client
into protective custody.

05:35.418 --> 05:37.876
This whole cartel situation
is out of control.

05:37.963 --> 05:39.545
She's not in
protective custody.

05:39.631 --> 05:40.747
She's in regular custody.

05:40.841 --> 05:42.377
As in she's
under arrest.

05:42.467 --> 05:44.424
There's been
a misunderstanding.

05:44.511 --> 05:45.922
If there has been,
it's yours.

05:46.012 --> 05:47.615
She was arrested trying
to flee the country.

05:47.639 --> 05:49.722
No, my client was trying
to flee a cartel hit man.

05:49.808 --> 05:51.118
Hell, I'd be running
for my life, too.

05:51.142 --> 05:53.225
It's a terrifying situation,
just terrifying.

05:53.311 --> 05:54.768
The cartel was neutralized.

05:54.855 --> 05:56.541
That didn't stop your client
from using them as cover

05:56.565 --> 05:57.976
for her own killings.

05:58.066 --> 05:59.377
And now she's actively involved
in the kidnapping

05:59.401 --> 06:00.401
of an FBI agent.

06:00.485 --> 06:01.726
Mm, I don't think so.

06:01.820 --> 06:03.152
My understanding
of the situation

06:03.238 --> 06:05.525
is that a cartel member
kidnapped your agent,

06:05.615 --> 06:07.777
just like an infamous
cartel hacker

06:07.868 --> 06:09.234
attempted to crash
Air Force One.

06:09.327 --> 06:11.660
Look, I'm happy
to clear all this up,

06:11.746 --> 06:13.558
but I'm starting to think
my client's being railroaded,

06:13.582 --> 06:14.868
and I would
like to see her now.

06:14.958 --> 06:17.416
Oh, and we should probably talk
next steps for her release.

06:17.502 --> 06:18.709
Sir...

06:21.172 --> 06:22.458
A call just came in
from a man

06:22.549 --> 06:23.960
saying he knows
where Jane is.

06:24.050 --> 06:27.669
Well, hey,
that sounds promisin'.

06:27.762 --> 06:29.674
- Put it through to my office.
- Yes, sir.

06:35.854 --> 06:38.562
I just texted Patterson.
She's gonna trace this call.

06:40.734 --> 06:42.270
This is Assistant Director
Edgar Reade

06:42.360 --> 06:44.022
and Special Agent Kurt Weller.

06:44.112 --> 06:45.715
<i>Put Madeline Burke on a plane</i>

06:45.739 --> 06:47.258
and fly her to Moscow,
and you get your agent back.

06:47.282 --> 06:48.648
<i>Simple as that.</i>

06:48.742 --> 06:50.052
There's no point
in disguising your voice.

06:50.076 --> 06:51.076
We know who you are.

06:51.077 --> 06:52.197
I have no knowledge of that.

06:52.287 --> 06:53.556
I've been asked
to broker a deal.

06:53.580 --> 06:54.580
For who?

06:54.664 --> 06:56.200
A separate
but interested party,

06:56.291 --> 06:57.998
acting of
their own volition.

06:58.084 --> 07:00.371
<i>Madeline Burke has no knowledge
of this call.</i>

07:01.087 --> 07:03.767
Okay, you must know nothing's ever
that simple. We don't negotiate...

07:03.840 --> 07:05.422
I'm not a terrorist,
I'm a businessman.

07:05.508 --> 07:07.090
I'm giving you
the deal of a lifetime.

07:07.177 --> 07:08.759
<i>One way or another,</i>

07:08.845 --> 07:10.677
Madeline's
getting out of this.

07:10.764 --> 07:12.426
<i>The same can't be said
for your agent.</i>

07:12.515 --> 07:13.926
Where is she?

07:14.017 --> 07:16.009
She is running out of time.

07:16.102 --> 07:17.343
I'll call you back.

07:17.437 --> 07:19.724
Where is my wife?!

07:26.655 --> 07:27.896
Oh, what the...

07:39.417 --> 07:40.749
Come on, come on.

07:49.052 --> 07:51.044
No-no-no-no. Please.

07:51.137 --> 07:52.878
Somebody help me!

07:55.600 --> 07:58.217
Help me.
Please, somebody help me!

07:58.311 --> 08:00.223
Help me, please!

08:23.211 --> 08:24.873
Okay...

08:32.511 --> 08:34.219
Uhh!

08:43.815 --> 08:46.649
Oh, my God.

08:46.735 --> 08:48.647
Okay, okay.

08:53.616 --> 08:54.616
Uhh!

09:01.458 --> 09:03.074
Who are you?
What do you want?

09:03.168 --> 09:04.478
<i>I am the only person</i>

09:04.502 --> 09:06.084
<i>who knows where you are.</i>

09:06.171 --> 09:07.787
Stay on the line.

09:07.881 --> 09:10.123
You're team's asking
for proof of life.

09:11.301 --> 09:12.508
You're agent's on the line.

09:12.594 --> 09:14.586
I've disabled her phone's
outgoing calls.

09:14.679 --> 09:17.217
<i>I'm the only connection you
have, and this is all you get.</i>

09:17.307 --> 09:18.617
<i>Oh, Kurt... Kurt...</i>

09:18.641 --> 09:19.927
Jane. Okay?

09:20.018 --> 09:21.620
No. No, I'm buried
underground, I've got...

09:21.644 --> 09:24.227
<i>There, she's alive.</i>

09:24.314 --> 09:26.500
If you want to keep it that way,
put Madeline on a plane.

09:26.524 --> 09:28.561
If we can make this deal,
then how do we reach you?

09:28.651 --> 09:29.858
<i>You don't.</i>

09:29.944 --> 09:31.651
When Madeline's safe,
I'll know.

09:31.738 --> 09:33.698
Then I'll give you
the coordinates for your agent.

09:36.493 --> 09:37.825
We have to make that deal.

09:37.911 --> 09:39.555
Okay, I hate to say this,
but it has to be said

09:39.579 --> 09:41.912
so that we all know
the rules of engagement here.

09:41.998 --> 09:43.614
DOJ will never
let Madeline walk.

09:43.708 --> 09:45.415
- Weitz can.
- Including Weitz.

09:45.502 --> 09:47.021
He was on the plane
when she tried to crash it.

09:47.045 --> 09:48.411
So there's no deal
to be made?

09:48.505 --> 09:50.371
That's not what I'm saying.
What I'm saying is

09:50.465 --> 09:51.817
even if there was
a deal to be had,

09:51.841 --> 09:53.048
and that's a big "if,"

09:53.134 --> 09:55.342
they'll never go for
what Dominic wants, period.

09:55.428 --> 09:56.839
Jane has been buried alive.

09:56.930 --> 09:58.637
So if we don't agree
to this guy's terms...

09:58.723 --> 10:00.259
Then we'll find her
another way.

10:00.350 --> 10:01.911
We'll keep pressing Madeline,
we'll keep tracking Dominic.

10:01.935 --> 10:03.051
We'll find her, Kurt.

10:03.144 --> 10:04.225
I promise.

10:05.480 --> 10:06.624
Were we able
to trace the call?

10:06.648 --> 10:08.310
Okay, kind of.

10:08.399 --> 10:10.311
Dominic is using
a super-encrypted VPN,

10:10.401 --> 10:12.393
but we did register
a cell tower ping

10:12.487 --> 10:15.104
in St. Lawrence County when he
connected Jane to the call.

10:15.198 --> 10:16.780
Jane could be on
a simple burner phone.

10:16.866 --> 10:20.075
If the ping is real, then
we should be able to call her.

10:20.161 --> 10:22.778
Okay, 61 phones pinged the tower
at the exact same time

10:22.872 --> 10:24.829
we were connected to Jane,
so the good news is,

10:24.916 --> 10:27.875
if Jane's phone is one of them,
she's in this radius.

10:27.961 --> 10:30.578
Bad news is this radius is
five miles of mostly wilderness,

10:30.672 --> 10:32.254
and she could be anywhere.

10:32.340 --> 10:33.831
Okay, start
calling these numbers.

10:33.925 --> 10:35.444
I'll send every
available agent up there.

10:35.468 --> 10:36.695
We gotta narrow
the search radius.

10:36.719 --> 10:37.960
Okay.

10:43.268 --> 10:44.509
Dominic just called.

10:44.602 --> 10:46.497
He's holding Jane captive
until we release Madeline.

10:46.521 --> 10:48.478
I'm sorry, I'm still
playing catch-up here.

10:48.565 --> 10:50.522
Uh, Dominic who?

10:50.608 --> 10:51.644
Dominic Masters.

10:51.734 --> 10:52.962
Your client's
security consultant.

10:52.986 --> 10:55.148
Former security consultant.

10:55.238 --> 10:57.341
Very good, very good.
And how do we know that?

10:57.365 --> 10:59.677
Surely whoever called didn't leave
a name and number at the beep.

10:59.701 --> 11:02.159
We have every reason in the
world to believe it was Dominic.

11:02.245 --> 11:04.532
So, you're saying
there's now

11:04.622 --> 11:07.706
a deranged former employee
out there,

11:07.792 --> 11:09.454
allegedly kidnapping
federal agents,

11:09.544 --> 11:12.127
possibly in cahoots with
the cartel targeting my client.

11:12.213 --> 11:13.232
We're not saying any of that.

11:13.256 --> 11:14.292
This is terrifying.

11:14.382 --> 11:15.748
My client's terrified.
Look at her.

11:17.135 --> 11:19.297
Thank goodness she's
in protective custody.

11:19.387 --> 11:21.470
She's not in protective custody.

11:21.556 --> 11:22.672
You're being charged

11:22.765 --> 11:24.006
under the Terrorism Act.

11:24.100 --> 11:25.762
Financial crimes,
espionage,

11:25.852 --> 11:28.139
murder, conspiracy,
acts of treason,

11:28.229 --> 11:30.457
including but not limited to
the murder of Blake Crawford

11:30.481 --> 11:33.064
and HCI Global board members,
the murder of Kira Evans,

11:33.151 --> 11:34.420
the murder of a hacker,
Del Toro,

11:34.444 --> 11:35.730
the murder
of a hacker, Leo Carr,

11:35.820 --> 11:37.356
and the Air Force One attack.

11:37.447 --> 11:39.091
Forgive me, but my client
will not be commentin'

11:39.115 --> 11:41.573
on these wild accusations.

11:41.659 --> 11:43.571
These are not wild
accusations.

11:44.913 --> 11:47.621
We have all of it
on good authority.

11:47.707 --> 11:49.573
So where's Dominic?

11:49.667 --> 11:51.533
Uh, "good authority"
means multiple sources.

11:51.628 --> 11:53.039
You do have
multiple sources, right,

11:53.129 --> 11:55.041
not just the...
the word of one person.

11:55.131 --> 11:56.872
We've got hard evidence.

11:56.966 --> 11:59.208
Well, if that's true,
I look forward to seeing it,

11:59.302 --> 12:01.635
and I'm dying to know
who's corroborating it.

12:01.721 --> 12:03.758
<i>My client is innocent
on all counts.</i>

12:03.848 --> 12:05.430
<i>She's happy
to help the FBI,</i>

12:05.516 --> 12:08.350
<i>but I won't let her sit here
and be intimidated or coerced</i>

12:08.436 --> 12:09.802
<i>into a false confession.</i>

12:09.896 --> 12:12.013
<i>Full stop.</i>

12:12.106 --> 12:13.893
How many numbers
do we have left?

12:13.983 --> 12:16.100
Two. The last one went
straight to voicemail,

12:16.194 --> 12:17.981
and I doubt Jane
is screening her calls.

12:18.071 --> 12:20.063
Where
are we on finding Jane?

12:20.156 --> 12:22.426
Uh, we're still calling
the phones that pinged the tower.

12:22.450 --> 12:24.316
It's gonna be
the last one.

12:24.410 --> 12:25.763
I told Patterson we should start
at the bottom of the list,

12:25.787 --> 12:27.198
but she said no...

12:27.288 --> 12:28.620
<i>When I get out of this box,</i>

12:28.706 --> 12:30.226
<i>- I am going to find you...</i>
- Hey! Jane?

12:30.250 --> 12:31.250
It's us.

12:31.334 --> 12:32.745
Oh, Kurt, thank God.

12:32.835 --> 12:33.835
Do you know
where I am?

12:33.920 --> 12:35.786
How are you able
to reach me?

12:35.880 --> 12:37.087
<i>Uh, long story short,</i>

12:37.173 --> 12:38.539
Patterson's systematic
to a fault,

12:38.633 --> 12:39.902
whereas I like to think
outside the box.

12:39.926 --> 12:41.133
Sorry, bad choice of words.

12:41.219 --> 12:42.426
Do we know
who's doing this?

12:42.512 --> 12:45.300
Dominic. He's trying to leverage
Madeline's release.

12:45.390 --> 12:46.972
You said that
you were buried.

12:47.058 --> 12:48.720
Anything else
you can tell us?

12:48.810 --> 12:50.392
I'm... I'm in a box
underground.

12:50.478 --> 12:53.186
Okay? I've got a flashlight
and a phone.

12:53.273 --> 12:54.273
Scramble the jets.

12:54.357 --> 12:56.349
Oh, well, not sure
that's enough to go on.

12:56.442 --> 12:57.808
Yeah, no kidding, Rich!

12:57.902 --> 12:59.505
All right, try to stay calm.
Relax your breathing.

12:59.529 --> 13:00.861
Try not to move around
too much.

13:00.947 --> 13:02.563
<i>Yeah, that's not gonna
be a problem.</i>

13:02.657 --> 13:04.677
There's not a whole lot of room
to move around in in here.

13:04.701 --> 13:06.470
What about the box itself?
What does it look like?

13:06.494 --> 13:08.030
<i>It's wood, it's, uh,</i>

13:08.121 --> 13:11.535
seven by...
two by two?

13:11.624 --> 13:13.616
I broke a board, uh...
a lot of dirt fell in.

13:13.710 --> 13:14.871
What was that?

13:14.961 --> 13:16.998
That's my battery.

13:17.088 --> 13:19.296
<i>I don't know how much longer
this phone's gonna last.</i>

13:19.382 --> 13:20.943
We should hang up
so she can conserve power.

13:20.967 --> 13:22.674
Hey, Jane,
we'll call you back.

13:22.760 --> 13:23.967
Okay.

13:24.053 --> 13:25.614
Keep your phone on
and try not to use it.

13:25.638 --> 13:26.845
- Kurt...
<i>- I know.</i>

13:26.931 --> 13:28.092
We will find you.

13:28.182 --> 13:29.514
<i>Now, hang in there.</i>

13:29.600 --> 13:30.841
<i>I love you, Jane.</i>

13:30.935 --> 13:32.551
<i>I love you, too.</i>

13:32.645 --> 13:34.081
Covering this much ground
could take forever.

13:34.105 --> 13:35.721
We need to narrow it down.

13:35.815 --> 13:37.351
Can we trace
her phone?

13:37.442 --> 13:38.877
We're trying,
but the closest lock we can get

13:38.901 --> 13:41.109
is the single cell tower,
so we can't triangulate.

13:41.195 --> 13:42.936
We're running out of time.

13:43.031 --> 13:45.398
Jane is very quickly running
out of breathable air.

13:45.491 --> 13:46.732
How long has she got?

13:46.826 --> 13:48.909
I can't say exactly,
but, uh...

13:48.995 --> 13:51.533
if we estimate that she's
been buried for an hour,

13:51.622 --> 13:54.114
uh, take into account
the dimensions of the box,

13:54.208 --> 13:56.416
plus her
carbon dioxide output...

13:56.502 --> 13:57.993
Patterson,
how long has she got?!

14:00.256 --> 14:02.168
39 minutes.

14:02.258 --> 14:03.499
At best.

14:15.063 --> 14:16.520
Please.

14:34.123 --> 14:36.410
We need to take
Dominic's deal!

14:36.501 --> 14:38.083
- We can't.
- Why?

14:38.169 --> 14:39.938
Have you got something planned
that I don't know about?

14:39.962 --> 14:41.294
You know the plan.

14:41.381 --> 14:43.418
Jane has less than
35 minutes to live.

14:43.508 --> 14:45.170
Rich and Patterson
are researching

14:45.259 --> 14:46.403
everything they can
about Dominic,

14:46.427 --> 14:47.529
and we can keep
pressing Madeline.

14:47.553 --> 14:48.614
She's still the best
lead we have.

14:48.638 --> 14:49.698
And she's still
not talking.

14:49.722 --> 14:51.429
We need
to take that deal!

14:51.516 --> 14:52.951
Sounds like y'all
might be leaning towards

14:52.975 --> 14:54.591
releasing my client.

14:54.685 --> 14:55.801
You're incorrect.

14:55.895 --> 14:57.682
Well, I got
all the time in the world.

14:57.772 --> 14:59.889
But I get the impression
you don't.

15:01.818 --> 15:03.150
You got a proposal?

15:03.236 --> 15:04.943
I do!
Turns out my client

15:05.029 --> 15:07.112
just remembered something
about Dominic Masters

15:07.198 --> 15:08.279
that might be useful.

15:08.366 --> 15:09.482
So let's hear it.

15:09.575 --> 15:11.862
Absolutely, but I
don't want Ms. Burke

15:11.953 --> 15:13.194
in the interrogation room.

15:13.287 --> 15:14.573
You mean on camera.

15:14.664 --> 15:16.030
Well, I don't
know about that,

15:16.124 --> 15:17.956
but I do know my client's
not a criminal.

15:18.042 --> 15:21.206
And I'm done letting her
be treated like one.

15:21.295 --> 15:23.332
Let me know
what y'all decide.

15:25.550 --> 15:27.337
Jane is running out of time.

15:27.427 --> 15:30.010
If Madeline
has something to say...

15:30.096 --> 15:31.962
we need to hear it.

15:34.058 --> 15:35.845
Fine. Let's wire
the conference room

15:35.935 --> 15:37.142
before we move her
in there.

15:37.228 --> 15:39.140
I still want every word
on record.

15:42.191 --> 15:43.432
Hello?

15:43.526 --> 15:44.767
<i>What's happening?
Are you close?</i>

15:44.861 --> 15:46.193
We have teams
searching the area,

15:46.279 --> 15:47.756
but we need your help
to narrow it down.

15:47.780 --> 15:49.021
<i>Okay. How?</i>

15:49.115 --> 15:50.217
I'm assuming you can't
see anything.

15:50.241 --> 15:51.241
Can you hear anything?

15:51.325 --> 15:52.657
- No.
- Do you remember anything

15:52.743 --> 15:54.304
between getting knocked out
at the hospital

15:54.328 --> 15:56.035
- and waking up in the box?
<i>- No.</i>

15:56.122 --> 15:57.322
What about the inside?

15:57.373 --> 15:59.581
- Is it labeled or...
- No.

15:59.667 --> 16:01.395
Come on, Jane, there's gotta be
something in there we can use.

16:01.419 --> 16:02.705
<i>There's nothing, I told you.</i>

16:02.795 --> 16:04.252
There's a phone,
a flashlight,

16:04.338 --> 16:05.579
and some dirt...
that's all.

16:05.673 --> 16:07.084
Okay, what does
the dirt look like?

16:07.175 --> 16:09.212
It looks like dirt,
Patterson.

16:09.302 --> 16:11.488
- Jane, calm your breathing.
- No, you calm your breathing.

16:11.512 --> 16:13.094
I am buried in a coffin, Rich.

16:13.181 --> 16:14.843
I mean, what does
the dirt feel like?

16:14.932 --> 16:16.798
The color, the temperature?

16:16.893 --> 16:18.634
Uh... it's...

16:19.729 --> 16:21.516
It's cold, uh, it's, uh...

16:21.606 --> 16:24.269
It's hard and grainy.
It's dark brown.

16:24.358 --> 16:25.598
Dark brown,
like coffee grounds?

16:25.651 --> 16:27.688
No, like, um...
Oreo crumbs.

16:27.778 --> 16:30.361
Okay, well, you're
gonna hate this next part,

16:30.448 --> 16:31.984
but we need you
to eat some of it.

16:32.074 --> 16:33.110
<i>Seriously?</i>

16:33.201 --> 16:34.908
Just imagine
it's Oreo crumbs.

16:34.994 --> 16:37.055
I swear to God, Rich, if you're
trying to get me to eat dirt...

16:37.079 --> 16:38.557
<i>No, no, no, no.
He's right.</i>

16:38.581 --> 16:40.163
<i>There could be
valuable clues in there.</i>

16:40.249 --> 16:41.602
But you don't have to eat it,
you can just taste it.

16:41.626 --> 16:43.037
Okay. Okay.

16:49.884 --> 16:51.625
Uh, it tastes like dirt,

16:51.719 --> 16:55.258
uh, with a...
hint of sulfur, maybe?

16:55.348 --> 16:57.761
Sulfur. It doesn't taste
how it smells, does it?

16:57.850 --> 16:59.432
<i>- Yeah.</i>
- Oh, God, gross.

16:59.519 --> 17:01.330
Jane, that is a huge clue.
We'll run with that,

17:01.354 --> 17:02.354
and we'll call you back.

17:02.438 --> 17:03.645
Wait, no, wait.
Don't hang up.

17:03.731 --> 17:05.171
Jane, we gotta
conserve your battery.

17:05.233 --> 17:07.211
No, I know, I know,
I just... I need to talk to Reade.

17:07.234 --> 17:08.521
I'm here!

17:08.611 --> 17:10.193
Alone.

17:11.113 --> 17:12.900
Uh, can...
Yeah.

17:17.954 --> 17:20.367
Hey, it's just me.
What's going on?

17:27.046 --> 17:28.537
Where's Dominic?

17:28.631 --> 17:31.999
Oh, hang on.
Don't answer that just yet.

17:32.093 --> 17:35.086
Just in case you guys
bug your own conference room,

17:35.179 --> 17:38.672
or someone else has...
can never be too careful.

17:38.766 --> 17:40.428
You can go
ahead and answer now.

17:40.518 --> 17:42.430
Just came from
the airport, huh?

17:42.520 --> 17:45.513
What? This?
I always carry one of these babies with me.

17:45.606 --> 17:47.848
You always carry
a frequency jammer with you?

17:47.942 --> 17:49.854
Don't worry,
it's got a small radius.

17:49.944 --> 17:52.778
It won't damage all your
fancy FBI equipment.

17:52.863 --> 17:55.321
It just ensures a private
conversation in this room.

17:55.408 --> 17:57.320
Now, I understand my client
has some information

17:57.410 --> 17:58.410
she believes relevant.

17:58.494 --> 17:59.985
Go ahead, Ms. Burke.

18:00.079 --> 18:01.661
But let's be
absolutely clear.

18:01.747 --> 18:03.704
If it is in fact Dominic

18:03.791 --> 18:05.578
who is carrying out
this horrendous act,

18:05.668 --> 18:06.829
he has acted alone.

18:06.919 --> 18:08.660
Whatever information
my client volunteers

18:08.754 --> 18:10.336
does not implicate her.

18:10.423 --> 18:11.459
Is that clear?

18:11.549 --> 18:12.790
Crystal.

18:12.883 --> 18:14.749
We have other ways
to implicate her.

18:14.844 --> 18:16.631
Now, what do you know?

18:16.721 --> 18:18.553
I suddenly can't recall.

18:18.639 --> 18:20.130
That is not what
we agreed to.

18:20.224 --> 18:22.216
A small favor might
jog my memory.

18:22.310 --> 18:24.427
We gave you everything
that you wanted!

18:24.520 --> 18:26.887
That is not correct.
My lawyer...

18:26.981 --> 18:28.722
asked that I be taken
out of interrogation.

18:28.816 --> 18:31.103
I am asking
for something else.

18:31.193 --> 18:32.775
Fine.

18:32.862 --> 18:33.862
What do you want?

18:33.946 --> 18:35.653
I want to call my sons.

18:35.740 --> 18:37.197
Well, hell,
that sounds easy enough.

18:37.283 --> 18:39.052
Between the cartel killings
and now the kidnapping,

18:39.076 --> 18:40.567
they must be
worried sick about me,

18:40.661 --> 18:43.779
and I want to assure them
that the FBI is protecting me.

18:43.873 --> 18:45.455
The FBI is not
protecting you.

18:45.541 --> 18:46.741
Well, it's just
a couple calls.

18:46.792 --> 18:48.579
What, you worried she's
gonna speak in code?

18:48.669 --> 18:50.230
Listen in, if you want.
I'll turn off my scrambler.

18:50.254 --> 18:51.836
Let's just make this work.

18:51.922 --> 18:53.663
Reade, can I have
a word?

19:01.932 --> 19:04.766
I know you don't like this,
and neither do I.

19:04.852 --> 19:05.932
But what choice
have we got?

19:18.866 --> 19:20.823
No.

19:20.910 --> 19:22.710
No more games.
We're not dropping the charges.

19:22.787 --> 19:24.073
We're not taking
Dominic's deal,

19:24.163 --> 19:25.515
and we're not letting you
call your sons.

19:25.539 --> 19:27.371
We're done.

19:28.668 --> 19:30.330
It doesn't look like
a "we" decision.

19:41.597 --> 19:42.633
Oh...

19:45.518 --> 19:46.634
Okay.

19:53.734 --> 19:55.691
Oh, God. Oh, no. No.

19:55.778 --> 19:57.189
We need to talk.

19:57.279 --> 19:58.736
Madeline is trying
to divide us.

19:58.823 --> 20:00.467
All you had to do
was let her call her sons.

20:00.491 --> 20:02.073
- That was it.
- And then what?

20:02.159 --> 20:03.695
She's running
the clock out, Kurt.

20:03.786 --> 20:05.013
She's always gonna
want something else,

20:05.037 --> 20:06.098
and we don't have
time for games.

20:06.122 --> 20:07.408
Neither does Jane.

20:07.498 --> 20:09.865
There is no
reason to believe

20:09.959 --> 20:12.292
Madeline is gonna give us
the intel she claims she has.

20:12.378 --> 20:13.563
And there is no reason
to believe

20:13.587 --> 20:14.815
Dominic's gonna give us
Jane's location

20:14.839 --> 20:16.191
once we put Madeline
on that plane.

20:16.215 --> 20:18.298
You know I'm right.

20:18.384 --> 20:20.421
I'm no good to you here.

20:20.511 --> 20:22.298
I'm gonna go
find my wife.

20:27.059 --> 20:30.052
You do have
one other option.

20:30.146 --> 20:31.603
Let me talk to her.

20:31.689 --> 20:33.931
No, you wanted to put the cuffs on Madeline,
and you did.

20:34.024 --> 20:35.085
I can't let you
question her.

20:35.109 --> 20:36.941
I know her better
than anyone else here.

20:37.027 --> 20:38.563
I am your best shot,
and you know it.

20:38.654 --> 20:40.941
Even if she is
playing games,

20:41.031 --> 20:42.442
she loves her family.

20:42.533 --> 20:44.320
That is her
pressure point.

20:46.704 --> 20:48.696
So let's make it hurt.

20:51.792 --> 20:52.792
Farr Mine!

20:52.877 --> 20:54.038
What?

20:54.128 --> 20:55.397
The sulfur that Jane
tasted in the dirt.

20:55.421 --> 20:56.898
It's from an old prospect
deposit site,

20:56.922 --> 20:58.333
and it's inside the radius.

20:58.424 --> 21:00.144
See, only soil that's
downhill from the mine

21:00.217 --> 21:02.174
would have been enriched
with mineral runoff,

21:02.261 --> 21:03.923
so that has to
narrow it down, right?

21:04.013 --> 21:05.379
You're welcome.

21:05.473 --> 21:07.305
Five-mile radius
just became two.

21:12.980 --> 21:14.332
Tell me you have something.

21:14.356 --> 21:17.144
We do. Are you okay?
You sound...

21:17.234 --> 21:18.850
Am I okay? No.

21:18.944 --> 21:20.310
No, I'm not okay.

21:20.404 --> 21:22.145
A weird-looking bug
just bit me.

21:22.239 --> 21:23.679
<i>I think it might
have been poisonous.</i>

21:23.741 --> 21:26.779
Or it's the beginning stages
of CO2 poisoning.

21:26.869 --> 21:28.576
I know I'm running
out of air.

21:28.662 --> 21:31.826
What do I got left,
half an hour?

21:31.916 --> 21:33.703
- Ehh...
- Don't worry about that right now.

21:33.793 --> 21:35.793
Kurt is on his way,
and we just need a bit more time

21:35.878 --> 21:37.710
to narrow down
the search radius.

21:37.797 --> 21:39.691
You know what, why don't you tell me
more about how weird this bug is.

21:39.715 --> 21:40.956
Maybe we can use that.

21:41.050 --> 21:43.463
It's hard to tell
because I squished it.

21:43.552 --> 21:45.214
It's mostly goo now,
but it was, uh,

21:45.304 --> 21:47.671
<i>black and brown with spikes.</i>

21:47.765 --> 21:49.677
Like a hairy millipede?

21:49.767 --> 21:51.258
Oh, that sounds like
a nightmare.

21:51.352 --> 21:53.514
- You are so bad at helping.
- Just... shh.

21:53.604 --> 21:55.186
Okay. Uh, Jane,

21:55.272 --> 21:56.416
<i>are you sure this thing
actually bit you?</i>

21:56.440 --> 21:57.931
Yeah, I'm pretty sure, Rich.

21:58.025 --> 21:59.687
I'm asking because
is it possible

21:59.777 --> 22:01.109
it pinched you or...

22:01.195 --> 22:02.606
Or what, Rich?

22:02.696 --> 22:04.562
Oh, no, no, no. No...

22:14.625 --> 22:16.457
What's going on?
Why isn't she answering?

22:16.544 --> 22:17.544
The phone must have died.

22:17.628 --> 22:18.855
Okay, well, we gotta
get her back on the line.

22:18.879 --> 22:20.586
Well, I... I don't
know how we do that!

22:20.673 --> 22:22.526
Okay, well, there's gotta be
something we can do.

22:22.550 --> 22:23.882
Okay, uh...

22:23.968 --> 22:25.049
Autodial.

22:25.135 --> 22:27.001
We can set up
an autodial

22:27.096 --> 22:29.383
that will keep
trying Jane's phone

22:29.473 --> 22:31.326
and connect us the second she
gets it back up and running.

22:31.350 --> 22:33.036
You said her battery died.
What do you expect her to do,

22:33.060 --> 22:34.871
lick her finger and then
plug it into the dirt?

22:34.895 --> 22:35.956
She'll think of something,
she's Jane!

22:35.980 --> 22:36.980
Okay, well, I hope so,

22:37.064 --> 22:38.375
because otherwise,
we're out of options!

22:38.399 --> 22:39.668
I know! Will you
stop yelling at me?

22:39.692 --> 22:41.274
I'm sorry,
I'm not angry, I'm scared!

22:41.360 --> 22:43.773
Me, too! Help me
set up autodial!

22:43.863 --> 22:44.979
Okay!

22:48.659 --> 22:50.651
Damn it!

24:09.823 --> 24:11.280
Well...

24:14.620 --> 24:16.532
Lovely to see you
again, Tasha.

24:16.622 --> 24:18.614
We're never gonna
release you.

24:18.707 --> 24:20.994
Then we have
nothing to discuss.

24:21.085 --> 24:23.418
We might be willing to overlook
your husband's murder.

24:23.504 --> 24:25.291
You mean heart attack.

24:25.381 --> 24:26.792
No, I mean murder.

24:26.882 --> 24:29.841
And there was this
remarkable moment

24:29.927 --> 24:31.463
just before he died

24:31.553 --> 24:33.135
when he realized...

24:33.222 --> 24:34.429
it was me.

24:34.515 --> 24:36.928
I know what poison she used.

24:37.017 --> 24:39.350
The same one she used
to poison Blake Crawford

24:39.436 --> 24:42.224
and the HCI Global
board members.

24:42.314 --> 24:44.601
They died in a plane crash.

24:44.692 --> 24:47.059
Yes, the same one
I died on.

24:47.152 --> 24:49.064
Do you remember that,
Madeline?

24:51.240 --> 24:53.857
So what happens when we
exhume your husband's body,

24:53.951 --> 24:55.817
knowing exactly
what to look for?

24:55.911 --> 24:57.903
You'd need a warrant for that.

24:57.997 --> 24:59.057
Yeah,
Assistant Director Reade

24:59.081 --> 25:00.162
is getting one as we speak,

25:00.249 --> 25:01.643
and then we'll all
find out together

25:01.667 --> 25:03.875
how undetectable that poison
she used really is.

25:06.005 --> 25:08.088
Of, course,
we don't have to.

25:14.013 --> 25:17.006
I know how much family
means to you.

25:17.099 --> 25:19.432
How much you
loved your father.

25:21.270 --> 25:25.856
How much your sons
love theirs.

25:30.320 --> 25:32.277
You tell us
where Dominic is,

25:32.364 --> 25:34.004
maybe we'll leave
your husband where he is

25:34.074 --> 25:35.565
and spare your sons
the devastation

25:35.659 --> 25:37.616
of knowing
you killed their dad.

25:39.079 --> 25:42.243
Maybe... we'll leave
that DUI buried, too.

25:42.332 --> 25:43.664
What DUI?

25:43.751 --> 25:46.835
Oh, her wayward
son's, uh...

25:46.920 --> 25:48.957
what was his...
what was his name again?

25:49.048 --> 25:51.415
The, uh... the youngest one.
The artist.

25:51.508 --> 25:54.000
Trevor Burke
never had a DUI.

25:54.094 --> 25:58.008
Because his mommy...
covered it up.

25:58.098 --> 25:59.714
You did a pretty good job
covering up

25:59.808 --> 26:01.800
the drunk driving incident
he had in college.

26:01.894 --> 26:04.014
I made sure the FBI would
never find any record of it.

26:04.104 --> 26:06.892
Your client knew
that her son was high,

26:06.982 --> 26:11.067
but she didn't know that they wanted
to charge him with possession.

26:11.153 --> 26:12.644
If this were
to resurface now,

26:12.738 --> 26:15.572
that much coke, he is
facing decades in prison.

26:15.657 --> 26:17.135
I don't know what
you're talking about,

26:17.159 --> 26:19.446
and I don't doubt
the FBI's ability

26:19.536 --> 26:21.368
to destroy
an innocent person!

26:21.455 --> 26:22.821
If my father were alive...

26:22.915 --> 26:24.225
Listen, I can't
speak to the past,

26:24.249 --> 26:25.894
but I can tell you that
you have a very big

26:25.918 --> 26:30.128
decision to make
about your family's future.

26:30.214 --> 26:31.421
Now, who are you
gonna protect?

26:31.507 --> 26:34.671
Your sons... or Dominic?

26:40.307 --> 26:41.785
I don't want
anything to happen to my sons.

26:41.809 --> 26:43.300
Do whatever it takes.

26:46.772 --> 26:48.980
I think we have a solution
everyone can live with.

26:49.066 --> 26:51.854
- Mm.
- She admits to nothin'.

26:51.944 --> 26:54.277
But even the accusation

26:54.363 --> 26:56.355
that she's responsible
for her husband's death

26:56.448 --> 26:58.030
would be devastatin'
to her family.

26:58.117 --> 27:01.406
And there's no reason
to ruin Trevor's entire life

27:01.495 --> 27:02.656
over a youthful mistake,

27:02.746 --> 27:05.534
so, for the sake
of her children...

27:05.624 --> 27:07.384
she'll tell you what
she knows about Dominic.

27:20.722 --> 27:22.088
Ah, come on.

27:49.084 --> 27:51.246
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

27:51.336 --> 27:52.872
Buck Moth!

27:52.963 --> 27:54.420
Where do you keep going?

27:54.506 --> 27:56.192
Buck Moth Caterpillar,
that's what stung Jane.

27:56.216 --> 27:58.299
Are you sure?
Oh, one million percent.

27:58.385 --> 28:00.217
This thing is spiky
and brown and black,

28:00.304 --> 28:01.670
and disgusting.
Ugh.

28:01.763 --> 28:05.097
Okay, Buck Moth caterpillars
are local to New York.

28:05.184 --> 28:06.891
They're endangered.
They live in

28:06.977 --> 28:09.219
and feed on oak trees
and they're gross.

28:09.313 --> 28:11.225
Okay, um...

28:11.315 --> 28:12.726
oak trees only comprise

28:12.816 --> 28:14.648
about 40 acres
of the woods.

28:14.735 --> 28:17.022
Madeline just told us where
Dominic's hunting cabin is.

28:17.112 --> 28:18.752
She claims not to know
the exact location,

28:18.780 --> 28:20.646
but that it's somewhere
in St. Lawrence County.

28:20.741 --> 28:22.027
Okay, well...

28:22.117 --> 28:23.303
She doesn't know that
we're already searching

28:23.327 --> 28:24.693
in the area.
That's something.

28:24.786 --> 28:27.073
All right, there are 37 cabins
in the area,

28:27.164 --> 28:29.531
12 within the original
search radius,

28:29.625 --> 28:31.582
uh, four downhill
from the mine.

28:31.668 --> 28:32.979
One in the oak
tree part of the woods.

28:33.003 --> 28:33.920
That's gotta be it!

28:33.921 --> 28:35.332
Send Weller the coordinates.

28:48.101 --> 28:49.637
Thirty seconds to target.

28:49.728 --> 28:52.391
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon.

28:55.776 --> 28:58.063
C'mon, c'mon.

29:16.046 --> 29:17.457
Hello?

29:17.547 --> 29:20.039
Hey!
Hey, help me!

29:20.133 --> 29:22.625
Help! Help me, please!
Down here!

29:34.314 --> 29:36.897
The cabin's empty.
Dominic's not here.

29:44.199 --> 29:45.315
What the hell
just happened?

29:45.409 --> 29:46.689
Did Madeline give us
false intel?

29:46.743 --> 29:47.984
No, I don't think so.

29:48.078 --> 29:49.865
Me neither.

29:51.873 --> 29:54.661
And whoever was here,
they just left.

29:54.751 --> 29:56.242
<i>- They left in a hurry.</i>
- All right.

29:56.336 --> 29:57.981
Every agent we have
is on their way to you.

29:58.005 --> 29:59.607
We're trying to catch
Dominic in a dragnet.

29:59.631 --> 30:01.088
- Any sign of Jane?
<i>- No.</i>

30:01.174 --> 30:02.210
Not yet.

30:02.301 --> 30:03.963
<i>The soil outside
the cabin</i>

30:04.052 --> 30:06.169
<i>hasn't been disturbed.
And the floorboards,</i>

30:06.263 --> 30:07.879
<i>they haven't even
been touched.</i>

30:10.892 --> 30:12.929
There is some soil
down here, though.

30:13.020 --> 30:15.137
<i>Looks like it's come from
the bottom of a shoe.</i>

30:17.190 --> 30:19.728
<i>It's full of sulfur.
She can't be too far.</i>

30:19.818 --> 30:21.309
<i>We're running out of time.</i>

30:21.403 --> 30:23.144
If we don't put
Madeline on a plane...

30:23.238 --> 30:24.524
then Jane's gonna die.

30:26.825 --> 30:28.566
I can't do it.
Jane asked me not to.

30:28.660 --> 30:30.117
What are you
talking about, Reade?

30:30.203 --> 30:31.483
Jane asked me
to speak privately.

30:31.538 --> 30:33.099
She doesn't want Madeline
to be set free.

30:33.123 --> 30:35.331
She made me promise not
to compromise the case for her.

30:35.417 --> 30:36.999
Of course she's gonna
say that!

30:37.085 --> 30:39.042
If she is going to die,

30:39.129 --> 30:41.212
she doesn't want her death
to be for nothing.

30:41.298 --> 30:42.414
She's not gonna die.

30:42.507 --> 30:44.248
She will if you don't
do this deal, Reade!

30:45.552 --> 30:48.795
Look, if we lose her...

30:48.889 --> 30:50.801
if we lose
any one of us

30:50.891 --> 30:54.055
<i>trying to take down
Madeline...</i>

30:54.770 --> 30:56.227
then Madeline wins.

30:57.147 --> 30:59.514
Look, Weitz and the DOJ
will never sign off on this.

30:59.608 --> 31:00.974
<i>If we make a deal,
it's on us.</i>

31:01.068 --> 31:02.650
<i>Everything
we've worked for,</i>

31:02.736 --> 31:04.398
it'll all go away.
We'll lose our jobs,

31:04.488 --> 31:06.007
we'll go to prison,
Madeline will go free...

31:06.031 --> 31:07.897
I don't care.

31:07.991 --> 31:10.199
Madeline's a psycho.
We'll have another shot at her.

31:10.285 --> 31:12.572
This is the only way
to save Jane.

31:12.662 --> 31:14.870
Send me to jail.

31:14.956 --> 31:16.322
Me too.

31:16.416 --> 31:18.328
Okay, I'm not sure
you guys are clear on

31:18.418 --> 31:21.582
how terrible prison
actually is, but...

31:22.631 --> 31:24.668
Okay, sure, if we're
all going, I'm in.

31:25.842 --> 31:27.504
I promised Jane
I wouldn't do this.

31:27.594 --> 31:30.257
You promised me
you would get her back.

31:36.269 --> 31:37.851
Please tell me
you caught him.

31:37.938 --> 31:39.474
- Is your agent okay?
- No.

31:39.564 --> 31:41.084
Dominic wasn't there
and neither was Jane.

31:41.108 --> 31:42.690
- We're running out of time.
- Oh, boy.

31:42.776 --> 31:44.813
This is awful,
just keeps getting worse.

31:44.903 --> 31:47.190
I'm gonna put Madeline
on a plane.

31:47.280 --> 31:49.021
If that's what
you think is best.

31:49.116 --> 31:50.510
But I'll need assurances
from Dominic

31:50.534 --> 31:52.617
that he'll hold up
his end of the bargain.

31:53.829 --> 31:55.195
I can make that happen.

31:55.288 --> 31:56.529
How?

31:56.623 --> 31:58.080
I'm in touch
with Dominic's lawyer.

31:58.625 --> 32:00.036
I'm sure you two
are very close.

32:00.127 --> 32:01.959
I mean, what do you
expect me to do?

32:02.045 --> 32:03.523
Just wait around here
all day while you dip

32:03.547 --> 32:04.708
in and out
at your leisure?

32:04.798 --> 32:06.084
There's an FBI agent
missing.

32:06.174 --> 32:07.631
We need to move on this!

32:07.717 --> 32:10.801
Did you tip Dominic off
about us coming to the cabin?

32:10.887 --> 32:12.298
That's a disbarrable offense

32:12.389 --> 32:14.301
and I have little-to-no
comment except that

32:14.391 --> 32:17.725
you've insulted me.
I'm insulted by that.

32:17.811 --> 32:19.894
My priority
is Ms. Burke.

32:30.657 --> 32:32.990
Come on, come on.

32:49.217 --> 32:51.004
Ah-ha!

32:51.094 --> 32:52.460
Yes, yes, yes.

32:52.554 --> 32:54.090
I'm here!
I'm here, it's me.

32:54.181 --> 32:55.181
We thought we lost you!

32:55.265 --> 32:56.676
<i>Yeah, me too.</i>

32:56.766 --> 32:58.098
<i>We're not out
of the woods yet.</i>

32:58.185 --> 32:59.517
No, but that's
a really good joke.

32:59.603 --> 33:00.746
How did you get your phone
to work again?

33:00.770 --> 33:02.352
<i>I hotwired it with my bra.</i>

33:02.439 --> 33:04.542
See, that makes sense.
Patterson's idea was something about dirt.

33:04.566 --> 33:06.057
Like that's a thing,
I don't know.

33:06.151 --> 33:07.767
<i>But it's getting hard
to breathe,</i>

33:07.861 --> 33:09.397
<i>and this phone
is gonna die any second,</i>

33:09.488 --> 33:11.275
so if you got a plan
you gotta do it fast.

33:11.364 --> 33:14.072
We do, and we are.
Every agent we have is in the area.

33:14.159 --> 33:15.525
<i>We're sending out
a signal burst</i>

33:15.619 --> 33:18.202
from your phone that
will hopefully connect

33:18.288 --> 33:19.870
to three or more
agents' phones,

33:19.956 --> 33:22.118
and we'll use that
to triangulate your location.

33:22.209 --> 33:23.728
We need to gain control
of your phone remotely,

33:23.752 --> 33:26.460
<i>which will take a minute,
and the entire plan hinges</i>

33:26.546 --> 33:28.333
on your phone's
serial number, so...

33:28.423 --> 33:29.423
Can you read the numbers?

33:29.508 --> 33:31.374
<i>No. No.</i>

33:31.468 --> 33:33.300
But I memorized it
in case we needed it.

33:33.386 --> 33:35.093
Of course she did.
She is such a badass.

33:35.180 --> 33:36.491
You know, just to have
the presence of mind...

33:36.515 --> 33:38.177
It's not about me,
but I think I would do

33:38.266 --> 33:39.494
- the same thing in that situation.
<i>- R... B...</i>

33:39.518 --> 33:42.135
<i>T... P... 4...</i>

33:57.577 --> 33:59.239
<i>Kurt, we've got Jane
on the line.</i>

33:59.329 --> 34:00.806
<i>We're just about set with
the signal burst,</i>

34:00.830 --> 34:02.537
<i>and she's asking for you.</i>

34:02.624 --> 34:04.115
Put her through.

34:04.209 --> 34:06.326
- Kurt...
<i>- Jane, you gotta save your oxygen.</i>

34:06.419 --> 34:08.126
No, I just...

34:08.213 --> 34:10.170
I needed to hear
your voice in case...

34:10.257 --> 34:12.840
We're gonna find you!
I promise you.

34:12.926 --> 34:14.507
I will find you, Jane.

34:14.594 --> 34:16.880
I know, I know, it's just...
We got one shot at this.

34:16.972 --> 34:18.088
If it doesn't work,

34:18.181 --> 34:19.842
<i>it's gonna kill my battery.</i>

34:19.933 --> 34:22.596
I just wanted
to say I love you.

34:23.603 --> 34:24.764
I love you, too.

34:24.853 --> 34:26.264
Jane?

34:26.356 --> 34:28.393
My battery is dying,
so it's now or never.

34:29.693 --> 34:31.059
Now!

34:35.156 --> 34:36.612
Hold positions.

35:00.223 --> 35:01.885
What happened?

35:01.975 --> 35:03.637
We just lost the signal.

35:03.727 --> 35:05.218
Jane's phone
must've died.

35:05.312 --> 35:07.053
Did we get it?

35:07.147 --> 35:08.604
Rich, did we get it?!

35:13.820 --> 35:15.607
We got it!
We got it.

35:27.709 --> 35:29.166
<i>We got her.</i>

35:32.297 --> 35:34.163
Move!
Outta my way!

35:35.342 --> 35:38.176
Oh, God, Kurt.

35:38.261 --> 35:39.843
Kurt! Kurt!

35:39.929 --> 35:41.886
Jane!

35:41.973 --> 35:44.681
I'm coming.
I'm coming!

35:48.188 --> 35:50.430
Kurt...

35:57.697 --> 35:59.233
Jane!

36:17.592 --> 36:19.333
How we doin' on that plane?

36:19.427 --> 36:21.168
Making the final
arrangements.

36:21.262 --> 36:23.345
All right, well...

36:23.431 --> 36:25.593
I guess this is <i>adieu.</i>

36:27.769 --> 36:30.102
Why didn't you kill me
when you had the chance?

36:30.188 --> 36:31.645
Don't answer that.

36:31.731 --> 36:33.643
Nonsense.
I'd be happy to.

36:33.733 --> 36:35.065
Hypothetically, of course.

36:35.151 --> 36:36.483
Of course.

36:38.405 --> 36:40.362
You were confused.

36:41.282 --> 36:44.070
You hadn't decided which side
you were truly on.

36:45.704 --> 36:46.945
You still haven't.

36:47.038 --> 36:48.995
What makes you think that?

36:54.921 --> 36:56.457
No...

36:57.841 --> 36:59.207
Jane! No!

37:02.137 --> 37:03.344
Jane!

37:07.600 --> 37:09.842
C'mere!
Help me!

37:09.936 --> 37:11.052
Get her!

37:13.398 --> 37:14.684
Jane...

37:16.693 --> 37:18.980
We spent a lot of time
together, Tasha.

37:19.070 --> 37:20.686
Enough time for me
to get to know you.

37:20.780 --> 37:21.861
The real you.

37:21.948 --> 37:23.189
And while I always
suspected

37:23.283 --> 37:25.240
you might be working
for the government,

37:25.326 --> 37:28.410
I also suspected there was
a chance I could turn you.

37:28.496 --> 37:29.737
Sorry to disappoint.

37:29.831 --> 37:32.073
Oh, no, you haven't.

37:32.167 --> 37:33.874
I wouldn't
change a thing.

37:34.544 --> 37:35.751
You might wanna
change one.

37:37.589 --> 37:39.205
And what would that be?

37:42.552 --> 37:44.839
Jane!
C'mon!

37:44.929 --> 37:46.966
Come on.
Come on.

37:47.056 --> 37:49.343
Come on!
Jane.

37:49.434 --> 37:51.721
No.
Jane, come on.

37:53.646 --> 37:56.764
Hey...
Hey.

37:58.151 --> 37:59.392
We got her!
She's okay.

37:59.486 --> 38:00.522
Jane...

38:16.628 --> 38:18.790
What the hell
is going on?

38:18.880 --> 38:21.372
I'm sending you to Rikers
to await trail.

38:21.466 --> 38:22.877
We had a deal.

38:22.967 --> 38:25.129
- Did we?
- Beats me.

38:25.220 --> 38:27.132
I don't recall
making any deal.

38:27.222 --> 38:29.760
At least, not one
that's on record.

38:31.476 --> 38:33.217
You will pay
for this, Tasha.

38:33.311 --> 38:35.894
Ask yourself,
will the FBI

38:35.980 --> 38:39.394
fully believe
you don't work for me?

38:39.484 --> 38:41.066
Ever!

38:52.831 --> 38:55.448
So, look, it's been a minute
since we've all done this.

38:55.542 --> 38:57.579
Yeah, what happened to
no more drinks in the lab?

38:57.669 --> 38:59.752
Laws were made to be broken.
Don't you mean rules?

38:59.838 --> 39:01.273
Look,
I'm not breaking any rules,

39:01.297 --> 39:03.025
I'm making an exception.
There's a difference.

39:03.049 --> 39:04.460
Yeah.
Being the boss.

39:04.551 --> 39:06.588
Damn right,
now quit interrupting me.

39:06.678 --> 39:08.447
I've been holding on
to this bottle for a while

39:08.471 --> 39:11.714
for a special occasion,
and I think this is it.

39:14.727 --> 39:15.843
Cheers.

39:19.440 --> 39:22.057
Thank you for finding me.

39:22.151 --> 39:23.712
The one thing that
kept me going was knowing

39:23.736 --> 39:25.978
you guys were coming.

39:26.072 --> 39:27.483
Always.

39:29.492 --> 39:30.949
Um, Reade...

39:31.035 --> 39:32.155
- Can we have a word?
- Yeah.

39:34.873 --> 39:38.116
I know you were
just doing your job.

39:38.835 --> 39:40.246
I know you were, too.

39:41.087 --> 39:42.203
So, we're good?

39:43.089 --> 39:44.955
Yeah.
And you were right.

39:45.049 --> 39:47.416
If we lose each other,
Madeline wins.

39:47.510 --> 39:49.297
Yeah.

40:03.902 --> 40:06.360
Whatever you're working on,
it's a tomorrow problem.

40:06.446 --> 40:08.688
- I'm looking for Dominic.
- And we'll find him.

40:08.781 --> 40:10.259
I'm about to go home.
You should do the same.

40:10.283 --> 40:11.283
I won't be long.

40:14.454 --> 40:16.537
Everything you did with
Madeline, was it worth it?

40:17.624 --> 40:19.115
Now that it's over?

40:19.208 --> 40:20.699
It has to be.

40:22.754 --> 40:24.871
I, uh...
spoke to Keaton.

40:24.964 --> 40:26.734
The CIA called off the dogs.
Keaton's in the clear.

40:26.758 --> 40:29.045
He's got carte blanche
to do whatever he wants now.

40:29.802 --> 40:32.215
What about you?
What do you want?

40:34.015 --> 40:35.426
I want to come back.

40:37.268 --> 40:39.601
- You're sure?
- Hundred percent.

40:45.902 --> 40:47.643
Cool.

40:47.737 --> 40:50.195
Just submit your application
to HR and we'll get back to you.

41:04.379 --> 41:06.496
Okay, let's make this quick.

41:06.589 --> 41:08.421
I'm on my way to the airport
with the fam,

41:08.508 --> 41:11.216
we're gonna try this
vacation thing again.

41:11.302 --> 41:13.919
Universal Japan is
supposed to be phenomenal,

41:14.013 --> 41:15.424
or even Hollywood's
fine, too.

41:15.515 --> 41:17.757
Anywhere but
the East Coast, right?

41:17.850 --> 41:19.954
That's a shame because Orlando
has some new attractions.

41:19.978 --> 41:22.470
Are you into this whole
Wizarding World thing?

41:22.563 --> 41:24.179
It's not just for kids.

41:24.273 --> 41:25.639
How pissed is Madeline?

41:25.733 --> 41:28.396
On a scale of 1 to 10,
I would say "very."

41:28.486 --> 41:31.445
You almost ruined everything
with that little stunt of yours.

41:31.531 --> 41:33.022
Thanks for the heads up.

41:33.116 --> 41:34.607
You're just lucky
nothing you did

41:34.701 --> 41:36.567
can be tied back
to my client.

41:36.661 --> 41:37.993
You mean your meal ticket?

41:38.079 --> 41:40.071
I'm your client too,
don't forget.

41:40.164 --> 41:42.326
Not anymore.

41:43.960 --> 41:46.293
Ooh, easy.

41:46.379 --> 41:50.794
I'm a lawyer, not a...
whatever you are.

41:50.883 --> 41:52.249
What's this?

41:52.343 --> 41:54.209
Everything you need
for Helios.

41:55.596 --> 41:57.258
Helios is still on?

41:57.348 --> 41:59.010
You bet.

41:59.100 --> 42:00.432
And you're runnin' it.

42:00.518 --> 42:02.225
Now, it's not gonna
be easy to get back

42:02.311 --> 42:04.348
into Madeline's good graces,

42:04.439 --> 42:07.557
but finishing her attack on the
Eastern seaboard's a good start.

42:08.693 --> 42:10.309
Take care now!

42:48.274 --> 42:49.685
<i>Greg, move your head!</i>
