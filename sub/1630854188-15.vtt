WEBVTT

00:06.896 --> 00:09.098
Missed a comma there, Sam.
Thank you.

00:09.098 --> 00:11.434
SASAPPIS:
I think you're gonna want
an apostrophe there.

00:11.434 --> 00:13.503
I mean, does she not see
the squiggly red line?

00:13.503 --> 00:15.104
Um... (chuckles)

00:15.104 --> 00:17.640
Hello, Flower. It is,
uh, me, Thorfinn.

00:17.640 --> 00:20.643
Uh, could I talk to you
in the other room?

00:20.643 --> 00:23.846
Well, no, 'cause
I'm in this room. Duh.

00:23.846 --> 00:25.314
Thor, we're gonna
find out anything

00:25.314 --> 00:26.616
you have to say anyway,
so just go ahead.

00:26.616 --> 00:28.651
(clearing throat):
Okay, well,

00:28.651 --> 00:30.653
you remember the other day
when you said you would go on

00:30.653 --> 00:32.188
one-on-one date with me?

00:32.188 --> 00:34.824
I was wondering...

00:34.824 --> 00:37.693
if you still want to. Wow.

00:37.693 --> 00:39.429
It's been a long time
since I was on

00:39.429 --> 00:41.931
a regular two-person date.

00:41.931 --> 00:45.034
I used to go on a lot of
three-person dates, some four.

00:45.034 --> 00:48.070
There was one date I don't have
a totally accurate number for,

00:48.070 --> 00:50.473
but it was however many people
could fit in a VW Bus.

00:50.473 --> 00:53.509
Look, Flower,
we don't have to...

00:53.509 --> 00:55.912
She didn't say no, Thor.
She just said she's nervous,

00:55.912 --> 00:58.047
and then overshared about
some sort of road orgy.

00:58.047 --> 01:00.283
There's no way they were all
wearing seat belts.

01:00.283 --> 01:02.185
No. Thor...

01:02.185 --> 01:03.753
I'm ready.

01:03.753 --> 01:05.421
It's time.

01:05.421 --> 01:06.856
(chuckling):
Okay, well...

01:06.856 --> 01:09.025
I'll pick you up
at your room tonight, uh...

01:09.025 --> 01:10.460
Cool.

01:10.460 --> 01:12.662
See you then.
(others chuckle)

01:12.662 --> 01:14.697
That's fantastic.
Congrats, buddy.

01:14.697 --> 01:16.599
Thor been dreaming
of this moment

01:16.599 --> 01:19.302
ever since that
magical day when

01:19.302 --> 01:20.503
Flower get eaten by bear.

01:20.503 --> 01:21.871
Oh, so what do you have planned?

01:21.871 --> 01:23.039
Well, truth is

01:23.039 --> 01:24.807
the only thing Thor know
about dating

01:24.807 --> 01:26.909
is from what I learned
on reality TV.

01:26.909 --> 01:28.377
But Thor can't
take Flower

01:28.377 --> 01:30.046
on hot-air balloon trip

01:30.046 --> 01:33.449
or to private concert
with unknown country music star

01:33.449 --> 01:35.551
whose label also owned
by the network.

01:35.551 --> 01:37.353
You don't need
any of that stuff, Thor.

01:37.353 --> 01:39.922
You can throw her a great date
right here at Woodstone.
Really?

01:39.922 --> 01:43.326
Do others who actually
have success at dating agree?

01:43.326 --> 01:44.861
Oh, absolutely.
Yeah, definitely.

01:44.861 --> 01:47.430
Yeah, I know you guys can't eat,
but I could ask Jay

01:47.430 --> 01:49.532
to cook a delicious meal
for you to smell.

01:49.532 --> 01:50.967
That would be amazing.

01:50.967 --> 01:52.768
And I could give you
your very own concert

01:52.768 --> 01:54.370
after dinner. Yes.

01:54.370 --> 01:57.406
A-And I could perform some
one-man improv for you guys.

01:57.406 --> 01:59.208
Absolutely, if time.

01:59.208 --> 02:00.610
We'll play it by ear.

02:00.610 --> 02:03.012
Tonight is gonna be
best first date ever.

02:03.012 --> 02:04.180

02:09.051 --> 02:11.387
Isaac, what are you
doing in here?

02:11.387 --> 02:12.655
I'm welcoming Nigel.

02:12.655 --> 02:14.123
He just moved in
to the library.

02:14.123 --> 02:17.026
Well, I've been waiting
for you by the window.

02:17.026 --> 02:19.962
Have you forgotten about
our weekly ponder?

02:19.962 --> 02:22.064
Weekly ponder?
ISAAC: Yes.

02:22.064 --> 02:24.233
Hetty and I meet regularly
to stare out of the window

02:24.233 --> 02:26.302
in the upstairs den and ponder
life's great mysteries.

02:26.302 --> 02:27.803
Why are we here?
What is our purpose?

02:27.803 --> 02:29.805
Do fish have nightmares?
You know, that type of thing.

02:29.805 --> 02:32.074
Well, please,
do not let me keep you.

02:32.074 --> 02:33.910
Are you sure?
The last thing
I would want

02:33.910 --> 02:35.778
is to come between you
and your best friend

02:35.778 --> 02:37.547
for the most special
of traditions.

02:37.547 --> 02:39.282
Well, then it's settled.

02:39.282 --> 02:41.684
Let's go, Isaac.

02:41.684 --> 02:43.953
Although, if I may be so bold,

02:43.953 --> 02:46.722
what if I were to
join the ponder?

02:46.722 --> 02:48.391
Oh, that's interesting.

02:48.391 --> 02:51.694
And yet, there really is
only room for two

02:51.694 --> 02:54.030
to comfortably stare
out that window.

02:54.030 --> 02:56.232
Well, it's lucky
I'm of slender build.

02:56.232 --> 02:58.668
I could insert myself
right between the two of you.

02:58.668 --> 03:00.336
How wonderful.

03:00.336 --> 03:02.104
Indeed.

03:03.506 --> 03:05.074
<i>(Jay laughs)</i>

03:05.074 --> 03:06.442
You want to postpone

03:06.442 --> 03:08.578
our Valentine's dinner date
to instead have me cook

03:08.578 --> 03:12.081
a four-course meal
for two ghosts to smell?

03:12.081 --> 03:14.383
Okay, sounds like
Jay's on board.

03:14.383 --> 03:17.153
Babe, you got to start learning
how to say no to the ghosts.

03:17.153 --> 03:19.789
I know it's a big ask, but
it's really important to Thor.

03:19.789 --> 03:22.124
Well, can't he just do it
another night?

03:22.124 --> 03:23.659
There's some concern
in the ghost community

03:23.659 --> 03:24.961
that Flower could
change her mind.

03:24.961 --> 03:26.662
And to be fair,
we weren't going out

03:26.662 --> 03:28.497
on the actual
Valentine's Day anyway.

03:28.497 --> 03:30.032
Right, because on that night,

03:30.032 --> 03:32.168
I was making food for humans
in exchange for money,

03:32.168 --> 03:34.036
which we're apparently
now using to make

03:34.036 --> 03:36.072
throwaway food
for invisible people.

03:36.072 --> 03:37.873
You can eat the stuff afterwards.

03:37.873 --> 03:40.743
Why did you say "you"
can eat it afterwards?

03:40.743 --> 03:43.679
'Cause Thor has
a very specific menu in mind

03:43.679 --> 03:46.082
which isn't exactly my taste.

03:46.082 --> 03:47.550
Hmm.
He wants to
surprise Flower

03:47.550 --> 03:48.818
with his favorite foods.

03:48.818 --> 03:50.286
He's very proud of his culture.

03:50.286 --> 03:53.189
Okay. What do Vikings eat?

03:53.189 --> 03:54.690
Cod. (chuckles)

03:54.690 --> 03:56.926
Obviously,
and some other things.

03:56.926 --> 03:59.929
Boiled antlers,
rams' testicles, pig heart,

03:59.929 --> 04:02.398
horse because special occasion.

04:02.398 --> 04:04.700
I'll make a list.
I do love cod.

04:04.700 --> 04:06.636
See? (chuckles)
You're gonna love it.

04:06.636 --> 04:08.704
NANCY:
<i>And who's this guy?</i>

04:08.704 --> 04:11.340
Once again,
that's Lord Landingham.

04:11.340 --> 04:14.076
He is the main character
of <i>Bodices & Barons.</i>

04:14.076 --> 04:16.812
As I've said
several times now. Right.

04:16.812 --> 04:20.082
Ah, Hetty, just the person
I've been looking for.

04:20.082 --> 04:22.118
I'm hosting a welcome tea
tomorrow night

04:22.118 --> 04:24.153
to properly greet
my new housemates,

04:24.153 --> 04:26.622
and I wanted to extend
an invitation.

04:26.622 --> 04:27.790
Tomorrow night, you say?

04:27.790 --> 04:29.091
Assuming I am not

04:29.091 --> 04:30.760
released from
this endless purgatory...

04:30.760 --> 04:32.762
(laughs) I shall be there.

04:32.762 --> 04:34.230
(chuckles) Splendid.

04:34.230 --> 04:35.498
I will see you then.

04:35.498 --> 04:37.133
Nancy.

04:37.133 --> 04:39.168
(grunts softly)

04:39.168 --> 04:41.103
Well, that was rude.

04:41.103 --> 04:42.204
What was?

04:42.204 --> 04:44.206
He invited me
right in front of you.

04:44.206 --> 04:45.841
Now, he has every reason

04:45.841 --> 04:48.444
to not want something like you
at his formal event,

04:48.444 --> 04:50.046
but still,
he could've waited for you

04:50.046 --> 04:52.281
to crawl back down to your lair
before approaching me.

04:52.281 --> 04:53.749
Ah, no worries.

04:53.749 --> 04:56.352
Captain Crumpet actually
invited me yesterday.

04:56.352 --> 04:58.854
I'm sorry, Nigel invited you

04:58.854 --> 05:00.356
before he invited me,

05:00.356 --> 05:01.791
the lady of the house?

05:01.791 --> 05:03.192
That's what it looks like.

05:03.192 --> 05:06.395
Well, this challenge
shall not go unanswered.

05:06.395 --> 05:08.064
Nigel will rue the day

05:08.064 --> 05:10.399
he courted Hetty Woodstone
as a rival.

05:10.399 --> 05:12.101
Now, who's this bald guy?

05:12.101 --> 05:14.570
Once again,
it is Lord Landingham.

05:14.570 --> 05:17.006
He took his hat off. Oh.

05:17.006 --> 05:19.809
THORFINN:
<i>Can't believe big night
finally here.</i>

05:19.809 --> 05:21.844
Are you sure silverware
properly laid out?

05:21.844 --> 05:24.513
What about those beard braids?
Are they okay?

05:24.513 --> 05:25.715
You're just nervous
'cause this is

05:25.715 --> 05:27.216
your first date ever,
but don't worry.

05:27.216 --> 05:29.018
You're gonna do great.
JAY: Yeah, big guy.

05:29.018 --> 05:33.255
You're amazing, and Flower
has almost no other options.

05:33.255 --> 05:35.024
Yeah. Just stay calm.

05:35.024 --> 05:36.358
You're putting
too much stress on this.

05:36.358 --> 05:38.327
(chuckles) No pressure.

05:38.327 --> 05:40.096
It's just that if date go badly,

05:40.096 --> 05:41.931
Flower will never
want to go out again,

05:41.931 --> 05:43.466
and then things awkward forever,

05:43.466 --> 05:45.768
and then Thor be miserable
for all of eternity

05:45.768 --> 05:48.504
and want to die but unable to.

05:48.504 --> 05:51.173
Uh, babe, I don't think that's
where the salad forks go.

05:51.173 --> 05:52.842
Oh, by the eye
of the All-father,

05:52.842 --> 05:54.643
this is a disaster!

06:00.483 --> 06:02.284
Okay, for your first course,
this is my take

06:02.284 --> 06:03.919
on sour rams' testicles,

06:03.919 --> 06:07.757
which I've paired with
an oaky cab, because why not?

06:11.494 --> 06:15.030
Okay. They are loving the
smell of your testicles.

06:15.030 --> 06:17.266
Happy Valentine's Day to me.

06:17.266 --> 06:20.202
So, what was last
two-person date you have?

06:20.202 --> 06:21.804
And follow-up--

06:21.804 --> 06:23.139
how does this compare?

06:23.139 --> 06:26.709
Um, it was with this guy Michael.

06:26.709 --> 06:29.311
And we just...

06:29.311 --> 06:31.580
hung out and listened to music.

06:31.580 --> 06:33.983
It's not a great idea
to bring up exes.

06:33.983 --> 06:35.417
Right, right.

06:35.417 --> 06:36.786
Thor forget
rules of dating.

06:36.786 --> 06:38.420
Never bring up
other contestants,

06:38.420 --> 06:40.523
and never eat big meal
before fantasy suite.

06:40.523 --> 06:42.358
There you go. (chuckles)

06:42.358 --> 06:44.460
So, Thor,
tell me about this dish.

06:44.460 --> 06:46.462
Did you eat it a lot
when you were alive?

06:46.462 --> 06:49.298
In my family,
we would eat as last meal

06:49.298 --> 06:51.467
before my father
would ride off into battle.

06:51.467 --> 06:53.602
Mm-hmm.
But one spring,

06:53.602 --> 06:55.905
Father did not return.

06:57.239 --> 06:59.341
And we never
eat testicles again.

06:59.341 --> 07:01.343
Oh, Thor.

07:01.343 --> 07:03.345
(sighs) I-I wish
I could try them.

07:03.345 --> 07:05.214
What do they taste like?

07:05.214 --> 07:07.283
Truth is, been so long,

07:07.283 --> 07:10.085
Thor not remember
what they taste like.

07:10.085 --> 07:14.123
This is sad for Thor
that this memory is lost.

07:14.123 --> 07:16.125
(gasps) I have an idea.

07:16.125 --> 07:17.459
Sam could try them

07:17.459 --> 07:18.928
and describe them to us.

07:18.928 --> 07:20.062
(chuckles):
Yes.

07:20.062 --> 07:21.230
Sam, please.

07:21.230 --> 07:22.998
In memory of
my father,

07:22.998 --> 07:24.600
try the testicles.

07:24.600 --> 07:27.703
Uh, Jay, the
ghosts are asking

07:27.703 --> 07:30.005
if you could eat
some of the dish

07:30.005 --> 07:32.174
and describe it to them.

07:32.174 --> 07:34.476
Isn't that something
you could do?

07:34.476 --> 07:35.811
Yeah, any person okay.

07:35.811 --> 07:37.613
What? Women
aren't allowed?

07:37.613 --> 07:39.381
That's so unfair,
but also,

07:39.381 --> 07:42.084
out of respect to
your culture, okay.

07:42.084 --> 07:44.687
Fine. (sighs)

07:51.393 --> 07:52.695
Mm.

07:53.529 --> 07:55.297
Well?
Yeah, it's not great.

07:55.297 --> 07:58.033
Why is it so chewy?

07:58.033 --> 08:01.003
THORFINN:
Mm, yes, all coming
back to Thor.

08:02.171 --> 08:04.240
This is...

08:04.240 --> 08:06.308
very special moment.

08:06.308 --> 08:07.910
Aw, Thor.

08:07.910 --> 08:09.678
I love this side of you.

08:10.846 --> 08:12.715
Ugh! Oh, God.

08:12.715 --> 08:15.217
The cab just
enhances the flavor.

08:15.217 --> 08:17.219

Oh, Pete says he has
45 minutes in him.

Cool.

09:03.332 --> 09:07.336

even once.

09:14.043 --> 09:17.046

(gasps) Yes.
I crushed that little girl.

a competing party

causing tons of
unnecessary drama in the house.

17:28.804 --> 17:31.139
as an opportunity
to lash out.

17:31.139 --> 17:33.642
Hetty, I had no idea
you felt that way.

17:33.642 --> 17:36.945
If it makes you feel any better,
I must admit

17:36.945 --> 17:39.815
I was a little threatened
by your closeness with Isaac.

17:39.815 --> 17:42.083
It's hard to be
the significant other

17:42.083 --> 17:44.753
when there's
such a significant... other.

17:44.753 --> 17:48.323
That may be why I issued
a late invitation.

17:48.323 --> 17:50.525
Huh. So it was a snub.

17:50.525 --> 17:52.394
One I deeply regret.

17:52.394 --> 17:53.462
Oh.

17:53.462 --> 17:54.596
Huzzah!

17:54.596 --> 17:56.598
Our wounds are healing. (laughs)

17:56.598 --> 17:58.233
And apply this knowledge
as a salve:

17:58.233 --> 18:01.403
There's enough of old Higgintoot
to go around.

18:01.403 --> 18:02.804
(laughing):
Oh, indeed.

18:02.804 --> 18:05.340
I was being completely silly.
As was I.

18:05.340 --> 18:07.042
Such a détente calls for tea.

18:07.042 --> 18:10.045
I shall summon Sam
to summon Jay.

18:10.045 --> 18:12.614
(laughter)

18:14.716 --> 18:16.551
You don't regret
the late invite.

18:16.551 --> 18:18.887
Half birthday, my ass.

18:20.121 --> 18:22.057
Isaac shall be mine.

18:22.057 --> 18:24.125
Over my dead body.

18:24.125 --> 18:25.560
(both scoff)

18:26.661 --> 18:28.530
Yeah, so that's what's
behind my hang-ups

18:28.530 --> 18:30.532
with a two-person thing.

18:30.532 --> 18:32.367
Very sorry that happened.

18:32.367 --> 18:33.935
That is very hard, but...

18:33.935 --> 18:35.937
also, what I'm hearing is that

18:35.937 --> 18:38.406
Thor so great at dating
that it is scary.

18:38.406 --> 18:40.408
(both laugh)

18:40.408 --> 18:41.643
The thing is, Flower,

18:41.643 --> 18:42.777
Thor cannot die.

18:42.777 --> 18:45.714
Thor already dead. But...

18:45.714 --> 18:50.452
beyond all that,
I know about pain, Flower.

18:50.452 --> 18:52.654
I know about loss.

18:52.654 --> 18:55.657
You recall powerful
testicle story?

18:55.657 --> 18:57.425
Of course.

18:57.425 --> 19:00.562
It was probably the most moving
testicle story I've ever heard.

19:00.562 --> 19:04.799
Thor not saying that
no bad things can ever happen,

19:04.799 --> 19:09.271
but when they do, maybe we could
be there for each other.

19:09.271 --> 19:11.640
Maybe we can.

19:11.640 --> 19:16.177
You saying that you are open
to dating Thor?

19:17.178 --> 19:18.547
Okay. What the hell?

19:18.547 --> 19:20.215
Yes!

19:20.215 --> 19:21.850
Wait.

19:21.850 --> 19:25.554
How will I know
you remember this conversation?

19:25.554 --> 19:27.389
Here's a little
secret, Thor.

19:27.389 --> 19:29.190
I may forget a lot of stuff,

19:29.190 --> 19:32.561
but I always remember
the important things.

19:32.561 --> 19:34.563
Like our date.

19:34.563 --> 19:36.631
And that kiss in the hallway.

19:36.631 --> 19:38.533
You remember?

19:38.533 --> 19:40.535
I could use a refresher.

19:40.535 --> 19:43.939
Okay, well,
we were in the hallway.

19:43.939 --> 19:46.508
I was faced north very sto...

19:46.508 --> 19:48.677
Come here,
you murderous bastard.

19:56.084 --> 19:57.419
Happy Valentine's Day.
(chuckles)

19:57.419 --> 19:59.588
Well, happy six days
after Valentine's Day.

19:59.588 --> 20:02.357
I'm sorry that your favorite
restaurant blacklisted us

20:02.357 --> 20:04.125
after we canceled
twice in a week.

20:04.125 --> 20:05.360
Ah, that's okay.

20:05.360 --> 20:07.028
No, it's not okay.

20:07.028 --> 20:09.564
You were right-- I do need to
say no to the ghosts more often.

20:09.564 --> 20:10.932
Especially when
it's about something

20:10.932 --> 20:12.067
that's important to us.

20:12.067 --> 20:13.335
Thank you.

20:13.335 --> 20:16.204
To our ghost-free dinner.

20:16.204 --> 20:18.173
Uh, Sam, is it
really ghost-free?

20:18.173 --> 20:20.942
I swear. I called in a favor
to guarantee absolute privacy.

20:20.942 --> 20:23.478
Look, Thor, I just need Sam
to light a candle.

20:23.478 --> 20:25.280
It is time for my aromatherapy.

20:25.280 --> 20:26.848
Sorry. Not on the list.

20:26.848 --> 20:28.783
Come on, I just need
a quick channel change.

20:28.783 --> 20:31.052
And I'm just feeling
kind of lonely right now.

20:31.052 --> 20:32.354
I miss Jay.

20:32.354 --> 20:33.588
ALBERTA:
Sam, come on!
Let us in!

20:33.588 --> 20:35.190
SASAPPIS:
Let me smell the lamb!

20:35.190 --> 20:37.492
This is nice.
PETE: Sam!

20:37.492 --> 20:39.728
Uh-huh.
