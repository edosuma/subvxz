WEBVTT

00:03.479 --> 00:06.778
Buonasera, Luigi's Pizza.

00:06.949 --> 00:11.249
Buonasera, it means "good evening"
in Italian.

00:11.421 --> 00:13.412
May I say having to explain that
to you...

00:13.589 --> 00:17.252
...calls into question
the authenticity of your ristorante?

00:17.927 --> 00:19.087
Okay, I'm out of here.

00:21.397 --> 00:24.298
Oh, for heaven's sake,
now you're being deliberately stupid.

00:25.601 --> 00:28.092
- Where are you going?
- I'm having dinner with Priya at Raj's.

00:28.271 --> 00:31.468
- Howard's gonna be there, wanna join us?
- But tonight's Thursday.

00:31.641 --> 00:34.576
On Thursdays everybody comes
over here and has pizza...

00:34.744 --> 00:38.646
...or a reasonable facsimile prepared
by someone claiming to be Luigi...

00:38.815 --> 00:41.409
...but who sounds suspiciously
like Jackie Chan.

00:42.618 --> 00:44.984
Can't we make a one-time exception
for tonight?

00:45.154 --> 00:48.681
We could.
We could also stop using the letter M.

00:48.891 --> 00:52.383
But I think that idea
is isguided and oronic.

00:53.162 --> 00:54.493
Just come with me to Raj's.

00:54.664 --> 00:57.258
- Well, I don't wanna go to a party.
- It's not a party.

00:57.433 --> 01:00.129
It's the same group who hang out here,
hanging out there.

01:00.336 --> 01:03.703
I'm sorry, but five people
eating and chatting is a party.

01:04.206 --> 01:06.402
How come it's not a party
when we do it here?

01:06.609 --> 01:08.133
Because we don't throw parties.

01:09.412 --> 01:10.436
I don't know, Sheldon.

01:10.613 --> 01:13.104
I'm going to see Priya, everyone's there.
You coming?

01:13.316 --> 01:15.409
Well, no, sir, and do you know why?

01:15.585 --> 01:17.314
Tradition.

01:18.354 --> 01:20.686
Every Thursday night
for the last eight years...

01:20.857 --> 01:24.657
...you and I and our friends
have gathered here in this very spot...

01:24.827 --> 01:27.660
...to break bread
covered with cheese and sauce...

01:27.864 --> 01:32.858
...discuss the issues of the day
and, yes, share a laugh or two.

01:33.035 --> 01:35.868
But I guess our rich heritage
means nothing to you.

01:36.839 --> 01:40.240
- I guess you're right. See you later.
- Wait, Leonard, wait.

01:40.476 --> 01:42.137
What am I going to do for dinner?

01:42.345 --> 01:45.371
- Come with me to Raj's and eat there.
- Well, I can't do that.

01:45.548 --> 01:48.642
What if he serves
haggis and blood pudding?

01:49.952 --> 01:52.546
I really doubt that's what he'll serve.

01:52.755 --> 01:53.813
But what if he does?

01:53.990 --> 01:57.983
I'll be obliged to dine on liver and lungs
stuffed in a sheep's stomach.

01:58.594 --> 02:02.860
Blood pudding is essentially the same.
I don't know why he's serving both.

02:03.900 --> 02:06.869
What do you wanna do?
Do you wanna come or sit here alone?

02:07.069 --> 02:08.696
No, I'll go to your haggis party.

02:10.006 --> 02:15.000
But I'm telling you, this is adness.
This is utter and coplete adness.

02:17.000 --> 02:23.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:40.970 --> 02:42.528
- Oh, dear.
- What?

02:42.705 --> 02:44.263
Raj's television.

02:44.440 --> 02:48.035
I just realized we're about to spend
an evening watching a plasma screen...

02:48.211 --> 02:51.408
...with a cluster of dead pixels
in the upper left-hand corner.

02:52.014 --> 02:54.209
So don't watch TV, read a book.

02:54.450 --> 02:57.851
And be a social pariah?
You know that's not my style.

03:02.925 --> 03:05.723
The audible sigh is a show
of exasperation, right?

03:06.295 --> 03:07.660
Right.

03:07.830 --> 03:11.163
Was it about me or the dead pixels?

03:11.701 --> 03:13.965
Hey, you're just in time.
We made Tex-Mex.

03:14.170 --> 03:17.196
- Oh, sounds great.
- Oh, Indians making Tex-Mex.

03:17.373 --> 03:20.035
Might as well have had
the Chinese pizza.

03:21.711 --> 03:22.871
- Hey, you.
- Hi.

03:25.248 --> 03:27.739
That's gotta be fun for you, huh?

03:28.651 --> 03:32.143
Watching Hofstadter suck the saliva
out of your sister's mouth?

03:33.823 --> 03:36.189
Excuse me, before this evening
goes any further...

03:36.359 --> 03:39.226
...we need to decide
where everyone's going to sit.

03:39.462 --> 03:41.225
There's no assigned seats, Sheldon.

03:41.397 --> 03:43.592
Just sit anywhere,
make yourself comfortable.

03:43.766 --> 03:47.497
Oh, what fun.
We're like hippies at a love-in.

03:48.971 --> 03:52.236
- Just sit here.
- Yeah, right on, man, right on.

03:54.543 --> 04:00.504
Oh, look, it's Harry Potter
and 98 Percent of the Sorcerer's Stone.

04:01.384 --> 04:04.876
Okay, we've got fajitas
with all the fixings...

04:05.054 --> 04:06.419
...so you make your own.

04:06.622 --> 04:09.284
Oh, that's wonderful.
Dinner, some assembly required.

04:11.193 --> 04:13.855
- Do you want a margarita, Sheldon?
- What...? A margarita?

04:14.030 --> 04:16.260
Where are we? What is happening?

04:19.035 --> 04:21.560
Oh, hey, Sheldon. What can I get you?

04:21.771 --> 04:23.534
Water, neat...

04:23.706 --> 04:26.004
...with a little umbrella.

04:26.208 --> 04:27.800
Where are all your friends?

04:28.044 --> 04:31.070
Sadly, Penny, this evening,
I am The Dark Knight...

04:31.247 --> 04:33.306
...roaming these mean streets alone.

04:33.549 --> 04:39.010
A windbreaker for my cape
and a stern expression for my cowl.

04:41.324 --> 04:42.723
Okay.

04:43.826 --> 04:46.522
Excuse me. Isn't this the point...

04:46.696 --> 04:50.029
...where the world-weary barkeep
absent-mindedly wipes down the bar...

04:50.199 --> 04:52.667
...and coaxes the woes
out of the troubled patron?

04:53.836 --> 04:57.431
Well, I was getting your stupid umbrella,
but all right.

04:59.041 --> 05:01.475
What's troubling you, buddy?

05:03.579 --> 05:06.742
I don't think your heart's in it,
but since you asked...

05:06.916 --> 05:10.044
Apparently, because Leonard is dating
Raj's sister...

05:10.219 --> 05:12.915
...we're all forced to hang out
at his apartment.

05:13.089 --> 05:15.683
- Oh, the horror.
- Yeah. Indeed.

05:15.858 --> 05:18.258
Yeah, at one point,
Raj put on reggae music...

05:18.427 --> 05:20.691
...and his sister took off her shoes.

05:20.863 --> 05:23.058
It was like the last days of Caligula.

05:28.004 --> 05:30.165
Oh, I have to get this.

05:30.339 --> 05:31.601
Umbrella?

05:34.543 --> 05:37.478
I wonder
what she's exasperated about?

05:38.080 --> 05:39.104
Hello?

05:39.281 --> 05:40.612
Sheldon, are you all right?

05:40.783 --> 05:43.308
When last we spoke,
you were gonna take a taxi home from Raj's.

05:43.486 --> 05:46.580
But according to Facebook, you just
checked in at the Cheesecake Factory.

05:46.789 --> 05:48.120
Yes, I was in a taxi...

05:48.290 --> 05:51.987
...but the driver didn't look at all
like the photograph on his license.

05:52.161 --> 05:54.595
So I leapt out and ran for it.

05:55.131 --> 05:56.792
Wise.

05:56.966 --> 06:00.959
Here you go, just like recovering
alcoholics drink in the Caribbean.

06:01.504 --> 06:02.994
Hi, bestie.

06:03.172 --> 06:05.106
Oh, hi, Amy. How you been?

06:05.307 --> 06:09.539
Fine. From this angle,
I can see up your nose.

06:09.745 --> 06:12.305
Yeah, it's a great time
to be alive, isn't it?

06:12.515 --> 06:16.246
Don't worry, my problems can wait
while you two hens finish your clucking.

06:17.820 --> 06:20.812
Look, Sheldon, Leonard is dating Priya.
She's staying with Raj.

06:20.990 --> 06:24.323
That means you're all probably gonna
be hanging out there more.

06:24.493 --> 06:26.427
Penny, sorry you got dragged into this.

06:26.662 --> 06:28.823
I know you're devastated
that your ex-boyfriend...

06:28.998 --> 06:33.059
...has found an exciting new lover
with flawless caramel-colored skin.

06:33.235 --> 06:35.499
Okay, I'm not upset
about Leonard and Priya.

06:35.704 --> 06:38.002
Your flaring nostrils indicate otherwise.

06:39.508 --> 06:41.499
Cluck, cluck, cluck.

06:42.511 --> 06:44.274
Sheldon, look at me.

06:44.447 --> 06:48.178
I think it's time to face the fact that
Leonard is the nucleus of your group.

06:48.350 --> 06:49.908
Where he goes, the group goes.

06:50.152 --> 06:52.916
Leonard, the nucleus?
That makes no sense.

06:53.089 --> 06:56.581
I'm the whimsical elf
that everyone looks to for a good time.

06:57.960 --> 07:02.659
I'm not saying that you're not fun.
You're the most fun person I know.

07:04.266 --> 07:06.894
A lot of people
think I'm fun to be around.

07:07.069 --> 07:09.230
Don't be needy, bestie.

07:09.438 --> 07:12.100
That's probably part
of what chased Leonard away.

07:13.242 --> 07:16.609
What I am saying, Sheldon,
is that your group is Leonard-centric.

07:17.179 --> 07:19.477
If it were a town,
it would be Leonardville.

07:19.682 --> 07:22.378
If it were an Islamic nation,
Leonardstan.

07:22.551 --> 07:24.781
If it were the birthplace
of motion pictures...

07:24.954 --> 07:27.582
...we'd all be singing
"Hooray for Leonardwood."

07:27.756 --> 07:29.781
Oh, I got a one.
If you guys were a band...

07:29.959 --> 07:31.654
...you'd be called
Leonard and the Leonards.

07:34.697 --> 07:36.096
So needy.

07:40.002 --> 07:43.233
- What you doing?
- I'm setting out snacks.

07:43.405 --> 07:46.738
You do realize everyone's eating
at Raj's again tonight.

07:46.909 --> 07:50.504
I didn't say the snacks were for you,
now, did I, Nosy Rosie?

07:54.984 --> 07:57.748
- You're having people over?
- Yes.

07:57.920 --> 08:01.083
Must be killing you, wondering who.
Fine, I'll tell you.

08:01.257 --> 08:05.159
It's Stuart from the comic book store,
Barry Kripke from the university...

08:05.327 --> 08:10.162
...Penny's ex-boyfriend, Zack,
and TV's LeVar Burton.

08:11.333 --> 08:13.665
Really? LeVar Burton's coming here?

08:13.869 --> 08:16.030
Possibly, I tweeted him.

08:17.640 --> 08:20.234
Okay, well, tell him
I loved him on Star Trek.

08:20.442 --> 08:23.605
Please, Leonard,
stop trying to horn in on my new friends.

08:24.680 --> 08:26.147
Of course, good night.

08:26.348 --> 08:28.282
- Leonard.
- Yeah?

08:29.485 --> 08:32.113
We had a good run, you and I.

08:34.190 --> 08:36.488
Okay.

08:36.692 --> 08:38.523
But change is a part of life.

08:39.195 --> 08:40.457
It certainly is.

08:41.496 --> 08:43.020
Okay.

08:43.566 --> 08:44.624
I have guests coming.

08:44.800 --> 08:47.826
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to ask you
to leave now.

08:50.706 --> 08:53.800
- I am leaving.
- Don't make this harder than it is.

08:54.910 --> 08:57.344
- Goodbye, Sheldon.
- And goodbye to you, sir.

09:05.054 --> 09:06.078
He'll be back.

09:06.255 --> 09:08.815
Of course I'll be back, I live here!

09:23.739 --> 09:26.867
Well, it would appear
LeVar Burton won't be joining us.

09:27.042 --> 09:29.476
So, um, let's get started.

09:29.645 --> 09:33.342
Uh, I thought we'd begin by going
around the room, introducing ourselves...

09:33.549 --> 09:35.847
...and saying a little bit
about why we're here.

09:36.018 --> 09:37.781
Okay, ahem, uh, I'm Sheldon.

09:37.953 --> 09:41.286
Uh, for readers of the New England
Journal of High Energy Physics...

09:41.490 --> 09:43.549
...I need no introduction.

09:43.726 --> 09:47.856
If you're not familiar with that,
there's a free copy in your goody bag.

09:51.133 --> 09:52.862
Stuart?

09:53.402 --> 09:56.064
Um, ahem, hi, I'm Stuart.

09:56.238 --> 09:57.933
I run a comic book store...

09:58.107 --> 10:01.770
...which, for financial reasons,
I'm currently living in.

10:02.244 --> 10:07.307
And I guess what I'm hoping for most
out of tonight is a hot shower.

10:08.317 --> 10:10.877
That's very nice, Stuart. Zack?

10:11.287 --> 10:13.551
I'm Zack and I'm, uh...

10:14.456 --> 10:16.651
Uh...

10:17.826 --> 10:19.589
Could you come back to me?

10:20.262 --> 10:23.163
Of course. Barry?

10:23.399 --> 10:26.800
I'm Barry Kripke and I'm here
because you told me there was a raffle.

10:29.071 --> 10:30.595
When is the raffle?

10:30.806 --> 10:32.899
Patience, patience, Barry, the waffle...
Ahem.

10:33.075 --> 10:35.168
The raffle...

10:35.344 --> 10:40.247
...is the grand finale to an evening-long
festival of fun and folly.

10:40.449 --> 10:43.543
- One more question...
- Yes, you must be present to win.

10:44.553 --> 10:47.613
Okay, I'm ready. I'm Zack and I'm, uh...

10:48.457 --> 10:50.322
Oh, crap, why is this so hard?

10:55.297 --> 10:56.321
- Oh, hey.
- Hi.

10:56.498 --> 10:59.490
- Yo, P-Dawg.
- Ha, ha. What's up?

10:59.702 --> 11:02.136
We're here to kidnap you
for a girls' night out.

11:02.304 --> 11:06.104
Parenthetical, the term "kidnap"
is being used playfully.

11:06.608 --> 11:07.836
I kind of figured that.

11:08.010 --> 11:11.002
Good, now put this pillowcase
over your head.

11:12.514 --> 11:13.947
No.

11:14.116 --> 11:17.449
She used to be much more fun
until Leonard punched her in the heart.

11:19.455 --> 11:22.982
We thought you might wanna go out,
have a good time, maybe go dancing.

11:23.192 --> 11:25.660
Oh, gee, thanks,
but I'm not really in the mood.

11:25.861 --> 11:27.692
You do understand it will distract you...

11:27.863 --> 11:30.354
...from obsessing
over the rich variety of sweet loving...

11:30.532 --> 11:33.990
...your ex-boyfriend is receiving
from the fiery jewel of Mumbai.

11:35.604 --> 11:37.902
Okay, look, if I agree to go out
with you guys...

11:38.107 --> 11:40.667
...will you stop pestering me
about Leonard and Priya?

11:40.876 --> 11:42.241
- Yes.
- Sure.

11:42.478 --> 11:44.969
All right, I'll go change.
Come on in.

11:45.147 --> 11:48.913
If you'd have let me bring chloroform, we
wouldn't have had all this jibber jabber.

11:52.388 --> 11:56.051
Anyway, after snowboarding,
I go to the lodge and get in the Jacuzzi.

11:56.225 --> 11:59.388
There's no one around,
so naturally I'm free-balling it.

12:00.863 --> 12:03.195
Next thing I know,
this beautiful chick shows up.

12:03.365 --> 12:05.697
Drunk out of her skull,
wants to get in with me.

12:05.901 --> 12:10.270
Question. Was it a Jacuzzi or a hot tub?

12:10.506 --> 12:14.408
- Really, that's your question?
- What's the difference?

12:14.643 --> 12:18.579
Jacuzzi is a commercial brand,
hot tub is the generic term...

12:18.781 --> 12:23.411
...i.e., all Jacuzzis are hot tubs
but not all hot tubs are Jacuzzis.

12:24.153 --> 12:28.419
Is that like all thumbs are fingers
but not all fingers are thumbs?

12:29.258 --> 12:31.385
Surprisingly, yes.

12:31.960 --> 12:34.155
Nice.

12:34.329 --> 12:36.559
Now, what exactly are toes?

12:38.600 --> 12:40.693
Can you please
get back to the drunk girl?

12:40.869 --> 12:43.360
I'd like something to think about
in the shower.

12:43.972 --> 12:45.462
Oh, yeah, right.

12:45.674 --> 12:48.040
She takes off all of her clothes,
climbs in the hot tub.

12:48.210 --> 12:51.441
- And the first thing I notice...
- The water level rose.

12:53.315 --> 12:54.907
- No.
- Well, of course it did.

12:55.083 --> 12:57.984
It's said that Archimedes,
the ancient Greek mathematician...

12:58.187 --> 13:01.816
...discovered the principle
of displacement while taking a bath.

13:03.058 --> 13:06.255
Terrific. Go ahead, Zack.
Naked drunk girl, free-balling, continue.

13:06.428 --> 13:07.895
Wait, forgive me...

13:08.063 --> 13:10.497
...but I think you'll find
my story is more interesting.

13:10.732 --> 13:13.064
Does yours have wet breasts in it?

13:14.336 --> 13:16.429
Better, it has a gold crown.

13:16.638 --> 13:19.334
You see, the king wondered
how much gold was in it...

13:19.508 --> 13:22.705
...and charged Archimedes
with coming up with the solution.

13:22.878 --> 13:26.473
The crown was irregularly shaped, there
was no way to determine its volume.

13:26.715 --> 13:29.309
But while bathing,
Archimedes realized...

13:29.485 --> 13:34.445
...he could immerse the crown
and measure the amount the water rose.

13:37.526 --> 13:39.494
So long story short, I nailed her.

13:44.600 --> 13:46.795
When he finished,
he shouted, "Eureka."

13:47.002 --> 13:48.663
No, I always shout, "Holy moly."

13:50.172 --> 13:52.868
Don't know why, just do.

13:55.110 --> 13:58.637
All right, that concludes the getting-
to-know-you portion of the evening.

13:58.847 --> 14:01.372
Now who's ready to play
some vintage video games?

14:01.550 --> 14:03.313
Tonight's selections include...

14:03.519 --> 14:06.852
...ColecoVision's
Rescue in Gargamel's Castle"...

14:07.022 --> 14:08.956
...Atari's "Cookie Monster Munch"...

14:09.124 --> 14:14.187
...and for you
text-adventure aficionados, "Zork."

14:14.363 --> 14:17.161
Pick me, pick me, I'm fun.

14:20.569 --> 14:23.060
That all sucks the big hairy meatball.

14:23.639 --> 14:25.937
How about I get the karaoke machine
out of my car...

14:26.108 --> 14:28.576
...get plastered
and blow the roof off this place?

14:28.810 --> 14:31.370
- Great, I'll make a beer run.
- And I'll take a shower.

14:31.547 --> 14:34.539
- We'll meet back here in 15.
- Check.

14:38.554 --> 14:40.715
I'm unhappy.

14:42.391 --> 14:45.417
This is delicious.
Where did you learn to make chili?

14:45.594 --> 14:48.825
When I was at university in England,
my flatmate was from Texas.

14:49.031 --> 14:51.226
I hope she wasn't anything
like my flatmate from Texas.

14:53.235 --> 14:54.896
Sheldon is a bit quirky, isn't he?

14:55.103 --> 14:59.938
Oh, please, that crazy bastard is looking
at quirky in the rearview mirror.

15:02.744 --> 15:04.575
Did you know that per our
roommate agreement...

15:04.746 --> 15:06.839
...I have to wash my feet
before I get in the shower?

15:07.049 --> 15:10.246
And not in the sink,
we each have special buckets.

15:11.620 --> 15:14.748
Raj, did you tell your sister about the time
Sheldon got punched by Bill Gates?

15:14.923 --> 15:16.948
- Oh, God, you're kidding.
- Ha, ha. Nope.

15:17.125 --> 15:20.561
Gates gave a speech at the university,
Sheldon went up to him and said:

15:20.729 --> 15:23.425
"Maybe if you weren't so distracted
by sick children in Africa...

15:23.599 --> 15:26.090
...you could have put a little
more thought into Windows Vista."

15:29.137 --> 15:31.105
Bam, right in the nose.

15:31.907 --> 15:34.535
Made me proud to own a PC.

15:34.743 --> 15:36.404
I'd like to propose a toast.

15:36.578 --> 15:39.274
To a rare and wonderful
Sheldon-free evening.

15:39.481 --> 15:41.415
- Hear, hear.
- Cheers.

15:42.851 --> 15:44.785
That's the first time
we've ever done that...

15:44.953 --> 15:48.150
...without having Sheldon tell us
why it's called a toast.

15:48.390 --> 15:50.255
And why is it called a toast?

15:50.425 --> 15:53.485
Oh, the ancient Romans
put spiced toast in their punch bowls.

15:56.164 --> 15:58.359
Sheldon tells it better.

15:59.735 --> 16:01.600
- He kind of does.
- Yeah.

16:03.739 --> 16:06.264
Oh, hell, I miss him.

16:09.678 --> 16:13.170
- Where do you guys wanna go dancing?
- We were hoping you'd know a place.

16:13.415 --> 16:15.280
Yes, perhaps somewhere
packed tightly...

16:15.450 --> 16:18.112
...with young beautiful bodies,
sweating and writhing...

16:18.286 --> 16:21.312
...against each other
in a glorious orgy of the flesh.

16:21.523 --> 16:23.821
Oh, yeah, I know that place.

16:25.027 --> 16:26.119
What do you think?

16:26.328 --> 16:30.788
That should display enough bosom
to attract a new mate or a hungry infant.

16:31.400 --> 16:33.891
Okay, let's go through this
one more time.

16:34.069 --> 16:35.934
Just because Leonard
has a new girlfriend...

16:36.104 --> 16:38.402
...doesn't mean I need to hook up
with some guy.

16:38.607 --> 16:41.667
- But you could if you wanted to, right?
- Well, yeah, I guess.

16:41.910 --> 16:43.707
Pick out the hottest guy
in the room...

16:43.912 --> 16:46.142
...take him home,
do unspeakable things to him.

16:46.314 --> 16:47.440
Kick him to the curb...

16:47.616 --> 16:50.983
...with a smile on his face
and teeth marks on his heinie?

16:52.721 --> 16:53.813
More or less.

16:55.290 --> 16:57.622
What's that like?

16:57.793 --> 16:59.954
I don't know,
it's fun while you're doing it.

17:00.128 --> 17:04.622
And then after it's mostly embarrassment,
self-loathing and regret.

17:04.833 --> 17:09.202
I would take that deal all day long.

17:09.371 --> 17:11.362
Yeah, well,
it's not gonna happen tonight.

17:11.540 --> 17:13.440
You know, for the first time in life...

17:13.608 --> 17:15.973
...l'm not in a relationship
and I'm totally okay with it.

17:16.144 --> 17:19.477
You know, if being on your own
is new to you, I'd be happy to share...

17:19.647 --> 17:24.210
...some tension-relieving techniques
for ladies I've perfected over the years.

17:25.153 --> 17:28.645
For example,
do you have an electric toothbrush?

17:30.225 --> 17:33.092
- Uh, no.
- You should get one.

17:34.896 --> 17:36.386
What's that?

17:36.565 --> 17:40.023
It appears to be something preserved
between two pieces of acrylic.

17:40.235 --> 17:43.762
Oh, it's a snowflake from the north
pole. Leonard gave it to me last year.

17:43.972 --> 17:46.202
Oh, God, that is so romantic.

17:46.408 --> 17:48.273
Yeah, it was.

17:48.844 --> 17:50.835
Leonard's really one of a kind.

17:51.046 --> 17:54.709
Saying that while holding a snowflake
is a little heavy-handed, don't you think?

17:55.383 --> 17:56.975
Let me see that.

18:00.288 --> 18:02.381
Oh, screw it.
I can deal with a little self-loathing.

18:02.557 --> 18:05.048
Let's go find me a heinie to bite.

18:05.927 --> 18:07.622
Outstanding. And if we fail...

18:07.796 --> 18:12.199
...we always can stop at CVS
and pick you out a nice toothbrush.

18:12.701 --> 18:15.363
I call mine Gerard.

18:17.506 --> 18:19.701
That's kind of creepy.

18:21.943 --> 18:24.571
Don't go breaking my heart

18:25.347 --> 18:26.974
I couldn't if I tried

18:29.184 --> 18:32.449
Oh, honey, if I get restless

18:32.621 --> 18:35.112
Baby, you're not that kind

18:38.260 --> 18:40.854
Don't go breaking my heart

18:41.797 --> 18:44.925
Anybody do
"Walking on Sunshine" yet?

18:46.234 --> 18:48.532
- No.
- Dibs.

18:51.973 --> 18:56.103
I'm sorry, Sheldon bought a loom
and learned how to weave?

18:56.311 --> 19:00.042
He actually got pretty good.
He made us all matching serapes.

19:00.248 --> 19:03.115
I still wear mine
when there's a nip in the air.

19:04.085 --> 19:07.282
Now, was this before or after
he adopted the 25 cats?

19:07.489 --> 19:10.151
Long before the cats.
I think it was around the time...

19:10.325 --> 19:14.091
...he tried to declare our apartment
a sovereign nation.

19:14.262 --> 19:16.662
I still have some of the currency.

19:18.033 --> 19:20.126
All my friends. All my friends.

19:21.069 --> 19:23.264
All my friends.

19:24.973 --> 19:28.807
I think it's like Beetlejuice.
We said his name too many times.

19:31.213 --> 19:33.181
- Come on in.
- Thank you.

19:33.381 --> 19:35.508
Hey, I thought you were
with your new buddies.

19:35.717 --> 19:39.312
I had to leave.
They were having fun wrong.

19:40.455 --> 19:42.787
- Come here, Sheldon, sit with me.
- Thank you.

19:42.958 --> 19:46.450
Would you like some homemade chili?

19:46.628 --> 19:47.822
Are there beans in it?

19:48.663 --> 19:50.631
- Yes.
- Oh, then it's not chili.

19:50.799 --> 19:52.824
Real chili has no beans in it.

19:53.001 --> 19:57.370
But you're from a foreign land,
so your ignorance is forgiven.

19:58.740 --> 20:02.836
- Sheldon, do you want some or not?
- Yes, please.

20:03.511 --> 20:06.344
Your girlfriend's
a little short-tempered.

20:06.514 --> 20:09.381
I'd like to propose a toast.

20:09.618 --> 20:11.711
To friends, no matter how quirky.

20:11.920 --> 20:13.911
Cheers.

20:14.656 --> 20:18.387
Priya, do you know
why this is called a toast?

20:18.560 --> 20:19.822
Actually, I do.

20:19.995 --> 20:24.056
I believe the Romans used to put
spiced toast in their punch bowls.

20:24.866 --> 20:27.198
She's also a bit of a know-it-all.

20:29.271 --> 20:30.295
Mm.

20:30.472 --> 20:33.202
This is good. Whatever it is.

20:40.815 --> 20:43.283
I'm walking on sunshine

20:43.451 --> 20:44.713
Whoa

20:44.886 --> 20:47.252
- I'm walking on sunshine
- Whoa

20:48.623 --> 20:50.750
Hello, I...

20:53.662 --> 20:55.823
Oh, I don't think so.

20:57.632 --> 21:00.328
I am so done with Twitter.

21:01.305 --> 21:07.266
