Good luck.

02:00.185 --> 02:02.218
Sorry.

02:02.220 --> 02:05.056

You, uh,

03:47.659 --> 03:49.661
Scissors?

04:35.539 --> 04:37.541
Fuck.

Here you go.

05:37.435 --> 05:39.437
Thanks.

05:40.505 --> 05:42.641
No problem.

05:50.815 --> 05:54.116
Not a local, are ya?

05:54.118 --> 05:56.986
How's that?

05:56.988 --> 05:59.490
You're not one of 'em?

06:00.858 --> 06:04.695
So, are you just passin' through town?

06:06.830 --> 06:09.533
Somethin' like that.

06:10.834 --> 06:14.604
Yep. Well...

06:14.606 --> 06:16.305
It seems it's always that way.

06:16.307 --> 06:18.677
People goin' somewhere else besides here.

06:22.880 --> 06:25.313
Anyway,

06:25.315 --> 06:28.320
you just let me know if
you need anything else.

06:50.375 --> 06:52.642
Hey there.

06:52.644 --> 06:54.376
Hey.

06:54.378 --> 06:56.380
Mmm.

06:58.817 --> 07:01.484
How you doin'?

07:01.486 --> 07:04.520
I'm okay.

07:04.522 --> 07:08.590
Yeah? It was nice last night.

07:08.592 --> 07:11.028
Yeah, it was.

07:16.099 --> 07:19.270
I gotta go, C.J.

07:21.171 --> 07:25.241
My kids'll be up soon.

07:25.243 --> 07:28.579
Maybe I'll see you again sometime.

07:30.682 --> 07:33.215
I don't think so.

07:33.217 --> 07:35.219
Oh.

07:39.623 --> 07:42.358
Do you mind if I wear this?

07:42.360 --> 07:44.362
No.

08:32.275 --> 08:34.076
How's it goin', C.J.?

08:34.078 --> 08:36.514
Figured you'd show up.

08:37.815 --> 08:39.818
Sooner or later.

08:40.951 --> 08:44.486
- Drink?
- No.

08:44.488 --> 08:47.255
- So, how was lockup?
- You've been there.

08:47.257 --> 08:49.925
You tell me.

08:49.927 --> 08:52.662
He your latest and greatest?

08:52.664 --> 08:54.329
Yeah.

08:54.331 --> 08:58.635
He's a good boy. Best we've had
riding with us since you went down.

09:01.004 --> 09:03.172
So, how was that titty bar?

09:03.174 --> 09:06.842
They got some <i>fine</i> pussy in
there for a local dive. Am I right?

09:08.378 --> 09:10.882
This is how it's gonna go down, Billy?

09:14.685 --> 09:17.319
C.J.,

09:17.321 --> 09:19.889
this is not personal.

09:19.891 --> 09:23.024
This is strictly business.

09:23.026 --> 09:27.228
I-I know I should've never
let it go on this long.

09:27.230 --> 09:30.399
- I guess I was hopin'...
- You were hopin' what?

09:30.401 --> 09:33.068
Somebody done it for you on the inside?

09:33.070 --> 09:36.905
- Huh? Well, they tried.
- You know me plenty damn good, man.

09:36.907 --> 09:39.140
I got no choice!

09:39.142 --> 09:43.846
I took a lot of heat for you
when the shit hit the fan, man.

09:43.848 --> 09:48.149
You killed one of us.

09:48.151 --> 09:51.853
- Caused a big fuckin' mess, man.
- I never ratted you out.

09:51.855 --> 09:55.924
- Or anybody else. Not once.
- I know. I know.

09:55.926 --> 09:58.829
And that's good. Really good.

09:59.998 --> 10:02.430
It's just that...

10:02.432 --> 10:05.836
sometimes you gotta do shit you don't like.

10:14.078 --> 10:15.944
Listen to me.

10:15.946 --> 10:17.446
It ends here, Billy.

10:17.448 --> 10:21.049
I'm gonna walk out that door,
and I'm never gonna look back.

10:21.051 --> 10:23.253
- Fuckin' do it!
- Shut up!

10:24.421 --> 10:28.024
You gotta forget I ever
existed, man. Look at me.

10:28.026 --> 10:30.195
Look at me!

10:32.195 --> 10:33.928
I'm leavin', man.

10:33.930 --> 10:36.899
But you can't follow me. All right?

10:36.901 --> 10:39.635
'Cause if you do, I gotta fuckin' kill you.

10:39.637 --> 10:42.940
Okay?

10:59.223 --> 11:01.226
Hey, Russ?

11:06.763 --> 11:10.601
- C.J.?
- Been a while.

11:13.771 --> 11:16.905
- It's just me.
- Thought maybe there were...

11:16.907 --> 11:19.975
- some of them, you know...
- No.

11:19.977 --> 11:22.113
Not anymore.

11:23.147 --> 11:25.914
So, uh, how's everything?

11:25.916 --> 11:29.150
Better than some, worse than others.

11:29.152 --> 11:31.589
Can't complain.

11:32.623 --> 11:35.290
So, um, all good with you?

11:35.292 --> 11:38.294
Gettin' out and all?

11:38.296 --> 11:40.428
So far.

11:40.430 --> 11:43.131
You know, I, um...

11:43.133 --> 11:47.369
think a lot about them summers I
spent with you and Aunt Mildred.

11:47.371 --> 11:50.505
Miss your mama.

11:50.507 --> 11:53.810
I'm sorry you weren't
there when she passed.

11:56.314 --> 11:58.347
Yeah.

11:58.349 --> 12:02.217
So, um, guess we should
get to it then, huh?

12:02.219 --> 12:07.524
Um, got your boots and some
clothes in those boxes right there.

12:32.382 --> 12:34.886
Been motorin' it since the day you left.

12:36.219 --> 12:40.825
Got the oil changed, uh,
started her up from time to time.

12:42.059 --> 12:44.693
Everything's up to date,
just like you asked.

12:44.695 --> 12:47.996
She's street-legal and all.

12:47.998 --> 12:51.033
Money you sent, um, worked out just fine.

12:51.035 --> 12:54.236
Even got myself a pint or two as a tip.

13:00.578 --> 13:05.049
Anyway...

13:09.921 --> 13:15.191
- Here's the key.
- Thanks.

13:15.193 --> 13:17.695
Man, I just love your bike, you know?

13:21.364 --> 13:26.769
What I wouldn't do to
own somethin' like that.

13:26.771 --> 13:29.140
Someday.

13:40.751 --> 13:45.089
I gotta get goin'.

13:54.498 --> 13:56.401
It's yours.

14:32.836 --> 14:35.337
Hey, Johnny, you got
those drinks I ordered?

14:35.339 --> 14:38.843
Sorry, Chet. There you go.

14:40.844 --> 14:44.513
Three Duck Farts. Tequila
chasers comin' right up.

14:44.515 --> 14:47.819
- Tanya.
- Oh, yep.

14:49.052 --> 14:51.153
- Hey, boys.
- Cheers, boys.

14:51.155 --> 14:54.289
- This has been goin' on for months.
- You know what? I just wanna...

14:55.959 --> 14:57.860
Well, you know, I mean,
business is business.

14:57.862 --> 15:01.899
I mean... Aw, I've tried to
work this thing out now, Ricki.

15:07.504 --> 15:11.406
- Pretty tasty, huh?
- That'll get you goin' straight. Whoa.

15:11.408 --> 15:15.345
- Yeah, straight to hell is more like it.
- All right. Here we go.

15:20.884 --> 15:23.851
- How'd it go?
- Just like we thought.

15:23.853 --> 15:27.190
- Got 30 days.
- Son of a bitch.

15:28.392 --> 15:29.991
You know, maybe I should
stick around tonight.

15:29.993 --> 15:32.494
- Everybody...
- No, no. Ain't gonna change things.

15:32.496 --> 15:34.862
- Yeah, but I think this...
- Look, you need a night off.

15:34.864 --> 15:37.832
- Yeah, I'll just...
- Would you get out of here?

15:37.834 --> 15:41.403
- Stop worrying so much.
- I can't help it.

15:41.405 --> 15:43.072
It's in my nature.

15:43.074 --> 15:44.773
I need anything, I'll
have a shout with Chet,

15:44.775 --> 15:47.576
and we'll figure it out
the old-fashioned way.

15:47.578 --> 15:50.712
I know. Get out of here.

15:50.714 --> 15:54.218
- Have a relaxin' night.
- All right.

15:55.552 --> 16:01.055
- You just call me, if you need anything.
- Go on. Get out.

16:01.057 --> 16:03.391
Chet.

16:03.393 --> 16:06.127
- I'm ready. You ready, boy?
- No, I'm on duty.

16:06.129 --> 16:09.633
- Mm-mmm.
- Okay. Put 'em down.

16:20.610 --> 16:22.877
What are you still doin' here?

16:22.879 --> 16:25.948
Man, this work should've
been done hours ago.

16:25.950 --> 16:28.250
I had to help Mom with
a few things earlier.

16:28.252 --> 16:32.087
You think bein' my son gives you the
right to come and go as you please?

16:32.089 --> 16:35.124
What am I supposed to tell these
other ranch hands that work for me?

16:35.126 --> 16:37.627
Well, I don't work for you, Dad.

16:39.397 --> 16:42.731
- I work for Gilley.
- Oh, is that a fact?

16:42.733 --> 16:46.501
Yes, sir, it is.

16:46.503 --> 16:49.905
You think you know it
all, don't ya, big shot?

16:49.907 --> 16:52.143
Got all the answers.

16:54.478 --> 16:56.980
I know enough not to
turn my back on people.

16:58.481 --> 17:01.182
It always comes around to the same
old thing with you, doesn't it?

17:01.184 --> 17:04.652
You know, that hole your mom
and Johnny dug themselves into...

17:04.654 --> 17:08.589
- with that bar, it ain't got nothin' to do with...
- You own the bank, Dad!

17:08.592 --> 17:10.425
Yeah, and it's a business.

17:10.428 --> 17:14.095
We got rules just like any other business.

17:14.097 --> 17:16.832
That's capitalism hard at work.

17:16.834 --> 17:18.534
Survival of the fittest.

17:18.536 --> 17:22.938
Not some half-ass entitlement
program givin' handouts.

17:22.940 --> 17:25.442
When that bar goes under,

17:26.643 --> 17:28.709
guess it's meant to.

17:28.711 --> 17:31.979
Fifteen years Mom gave you don't
mean nothin' to you, did they?

17:31.981 --> 17:33.984
Gave me?

17:35.018 --> 17:37.287
Tell you what, big boy.

17:38.389 --> 17:40.956
Next time you get the chance,

17:40.958 --> 17:43.825
you just ask your mom why she left me.

17:43.827 --> 17:45.829
You see what she says.

17:47.163 --> 17:49.366
Then we'll talk.

17:54.572 --> 17:57.542
- I'm done here.
- Yeah, you are.

17:59.075 --> 18:01.209
Brody, one of these days,
you're gonna have to pick...

18:01.211 --> 18:03.378
which side of the fence you wanna stand on.

18:03.380 --> 18:06.849
Son, it can't be both.

18:06.851 --> 18:10.220
I already have. I quit.

18:18.863 --> 18:21.162
What's that all about?

18:21.164 --> 18:25.100
Ah, he's mouthin' off about quittin' again.

18:25.102 --> 18:26.767
Ah, he'll come around.

18:26.769 --> 18:29.871
Kids always do, especially when
they run out of money. Beer?

18:29.873 --> 18:31.707
Yeah, sure, thanks.

18:31.709 --> 18:35.843
You know, I really didn't like
him workin' out here anyway.

18:35.845 --> 18:39.915
- Especially at night.
- Relax. All right?

18:39.917 --> 18:44.555
This place is tight as
two rats fuckin' in a sock.

18:46.457 --> 18:49.791
Ball doesn't drop till
midnight. You know that.

18:49.793 --> 18:53.896
- I know, I know.
- Hell, Brody's harmless.

18:53.898 --> 18:58.399
Works his balls off. At least he's not
livin' off the dole, like Ty and Joey.

18:58.401 --> 19:01.305
Hey, you created that problem.

19:02.439 --> 19:05.541
- Everything go in town?
- Goin' good.

19:05.543 --> 19:08.276
Served the notice myself.

19:08.278 --> 19:11.748
- Payback's a bitch, huh?
- Yeah, then some.

19:13.551 --> 19:16.251
I want that dirt, Wade. Understand?

19:16.253 --> 19:19.787
I don't need any
encouragement. Trust me on that.

19:19.789 --> 19:23.057
That's my partner.

19:23.059 --> 19:25.893
Taste for blood. Go for the kill.

19:25.895 --> 19:30.166
You're not careful, you might
end up filthy rich, like me.

19:39.309 --> 19:43.144
Well, I, uh, checked out the
main water connection, and, uh,

19:43.146 --> 19:44.979
I hate to say it, bud.

19:44.981 --> 19:47.482
But if you wanna figure out what's
goin' on with your water pressure,

19:47.484 --> 19:50.686
you gotta get down there and dig underneath
and get a good look inside the pipes.

19:50.688 --> 19:52.955
You're kiddin' me. Tell
me you're kiddin' me.

19:52.957 --> 19:55.157
You're probably gonna
have to re-pipe the copper.

19:55.159 --> 19:57.426
Well, how much is that gonna cost me?

19:57.428 --> 20:00.361
There's no way to tell till I get up in it.

20:00.363 --> 20:03.832
Oh, all right. Well, shit.

20:03.834 --> 20:07.369
- Sorry 'bout that.
- Hey, if it ain't one thing, it's 10 more.

20:07.371 --> 20:09.674
You can guarantee that
one. We'll see you, buddy.

20:13.509 --> 20:15.843
- Anything worth drinkin' back there?
- You name it, I got it.

20:15.845 --> 20:19.348
How 'bout somethin' special then?

20:19.350 --> 20:22.050
Holy... Well!

20:22.052 --> 20:24.719
Johnny Boyd.

20:24.721 --> 20:27.355
The things you see when
you don't have a gun.

20:27.357 --> 20:30.158
C.J. Jennings.

20:30.160 --> 20:32.361
- How are you, Johnny?
- My main man.

20:32.363 --> 20:34.062
- How you doin', buddy?
- Doin' awesome.

20:34.064 --> 20:35.730
Well, it's good to see you.

20:35.732 --> 20:37.666
So, uh, how's everything?

20:37.668 --> 20:39.234
Depends on who you ask, I guess.

20:39.236 --> 20:41.003
- Always does.
- Tanya?

20:41.005 --> 20:44.238
- Yeah.
- Break out the shine.

20:44.240 --> 20:46.341
Sure thing.

20:46.343 --> 20:48.843
It's gonna get ugly, huh, with the shine?

20:48.845 --> 20:52.046
I don't know a soul who is stupid
enough to drink that with me.

20:52.048 --> 20:55.350
- Except you.
- Yeah, well, that's their loss.

20:55.352 --> 21:00.155
Yeah. Think the last time
I saw you was Sturgis.

21:00.157 --> 21:03.492
Black Hills rally. That
was some good times.

21:03.494 --> 21:07.496
That's right. You were runnin'
with a pretty rough crowd back then.

21:07.498 --> 21:10.599
- Yeah. Seemed right at the time.
- Mm-hmm.

21:10.601 --> 21:13.034
And now?

21:13.036 --> 21:15.271
I'm standin' here, aren't I?

21:18.508 --> 21:20.441
Thank you, darlin'.

21:20.443 --> 21:22.410
- No.
- All right.

21:22.412 --> 21:24.246
Oh, boy.

21:24.248 --> 21:26.448
Just like Mama used to make.

21:26.450 --> 21:30.386
- Here we go, huh?
- To hard living... and good times.

21:31.854 --> 21:34.057
And friends like you.

21:35.625 --> 21:38.259
Mmm.

21:38.261 --> 21:41.630
I, uh, can't exactly say
the same about myself.

21:41.632 --> 21:45.434
Ah, shit. Don't be so
hard on yourself, C.J.

21:45.436 --> 21:48.303
You've always been a damn good bad example.

21:51.240 --> 21:54.909
She ain't here. It's her night off.

21:54.911 --> 21:57.813
- That obvious, huh?
- Well, let's just say, if we were playin' poker,

21:57.815 --> 22:01.416
I'd have all your money right now.

22:01.418 --> 22:05.720
So, how is she?

22:05.722 --> 22:08.258
Like I said before, depends on who you ask.

22:11.795 --> 22:15.263
Got the next best thing though. Hey, Brody!

22:15.265 --> 22:17.267
Come over here.

22:18.469 --> 22:20.235
What's up?

22:20.237 --> 22:23.304
This here's an old friend of mine
and your mom's. C.J. Jennings.

22:23.306 --> 22:25.474
- All right. Nice to meet you.
- You too.

22:25.476 --> 22:28.476
Brody is Ricki's son.

22:28.478 --> 22:32.080
- Guilty.
- C.J. and I used to run together back in the day.

22:32.082 --> 22:34.349
Oh, is this the guy you talk so much about?

22:34.351 --> 22:36.685
- The very one.
- Uh-oh.

22:36.687 --> 22:39.955
Yeah, probably a bunch of
half-truths and half-lies.

22:39.957 --> 22:43.124
- Kind of like fishin'.
- Well, listen, I got a few things I gotta wrap up here.

22:43.126 --> 22:45.593
Why don't you all have a
cold beer, visit for a few.

22:45.595 --> 22:47.129
Okay. All right. Sure.

22:47.131 --> 22:48.996
- Tanya?
- Yeah.

22:48.998 --> 22:51.365
- Take care of these guys for me, would you?
- Sure thing.

22:51.367 --> 22:53.701
I might even give 'em drinks too.

22:53.703 --> 22:56.537
- What can I get for you guys?
- Oh, uh...

22:56.539 --> 22:58.640
- Your call.
- Couple of cold ones is good.

22:58.642 --> 23:00.945
You got it.

23:04.715 --> 23:06.547
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

23:06.549 --> 23:09.485
Mm-hmm.

23:10.821 --> 23:13.321
Here we go. Sure.

23:13.323 --> 23:15.724
Lead the way.

23:15.726 --> 23:18.293
Sounds like you and Johnny tore
it up when y'all were younger.

23:18.295 --> 23:21.565
Oh, yeah. We ran pretty hard.

23:22.665 --> 23:26.034
You know, I've known Johnny
and your family ever since...

23:26.036 --> 23:28.570
I don't know... ever since
I can remember, really.

23:28.572 --> 23:30.572
Johnny and I were
inseparable when we were kids.

23:30.574 --> 23:32.640
- Yeah?
- Oh, yeah.

23:32.642 --> 23:36.378
You know, buildin' forts
and chasin' girls, of course.

23:36.380 --> 23:39.413
- Got our first little dirt bikes together.
- Oh, my God.

23:39.415 --> 23:41.149
Johnny's told me so many stories...

23:41.151 --> 23:43.418
C.J. Jennings's legend, I call it.

23:43.420 --> 23:46.822
So...

23:46.824 --> 23:49.890
- Can I ask you a question?
- Name it.

23:49.892 --> 23:52.062
Is it true you rode with the underground?

23:53.162 --> 23:55.863
Yeah. It's true.

23:55.865 --> 23:58.899
Wow. Is it everything they say it is?

23:58.901 --> 24:01.937
Probably not.

24:01.939 --> 24:03.705
- Ha!
- Hey, Brody.

24:03.707 --> 24:06.041
Hey, Joey. What are you all up to?

24:06.043 --> 24:08.743
Oh, you know. Thought we'd come by
and see how the other half lives.

24:08.745 --> 24:11.382
- Yeah, well.
- Ty.

24:12.748 --> 24:16.284
- Who's your friend?
- Ah, Joey Daniels, C.J. Jennings.

24:16.286 --> 24:18.018
- How you doin', Joey?
- Old buddy of Johnny's.

24:18.020 --> 24:20.421
- Nice to meet you.
- Likewise. That's my brother.

24:20.423 --> 24:23.024
- Hey, man.
- You're comin' out to the ranch tomorrow?

24:23.026 --> 24:27.128
Ah, probably not. I, um...
I'll be here at the bar working.

24:27.130 --> 24:29.630
Unlike you trust-fund babies.

24:29.632 --> 24:33.301
Last I heard, your old man was makin'
plenty of money, right alongside mine.

24:33.303 --> 24:36.303
Yeah. Well, I don't need his money.

24:36.305 --> 24:40.207
- Yeah, right.
- So, what's a girl gotta do to get a drink around here?

24:40.209 --> 24:44.781
- Uh, well, what would you like?
- Whatever you like, I like.

24:47.718 --> 24:50.284
What about tonight?
What y'all got goin' on?

24:50.286 --> 24:53.121
We're meetin' a friend of
Jake's here and then, you know...

24:53.123 --> 24:57.993
- Bro, she's hot as sin. Stops traffic.
- Yeah. Okay.

24:57.995 --> 25:00.896
- Hey, Jake.
- Hey, Morgan, how ya doin'?

25:00.898 --> 25:02.630
- Y'all, this is Morgan.
- You're lookin' good.

25:02.632 --> 25:07.669
- Hey, Morgan. I'm... I'm Brody Locklin.
- Hi. Hey, Brody Locklin.

25:07.671 --> 25:09.838
How ya doin'? Uh, can I get you a seat?

25:09.840 --> 25:11.406
- Sure thing.
- Here ya go.

25:11.408 --> 25:13.975
You didn't ask me to have a seat, Brody?

25:13.977 --> 25:16.977
- Uh, yeah, uh, well...
- You what?

25:16.979 --> 25:19.283
- I didn't mean...
- I'm just teasin'.

25:20.651 --> 25:22.617
Hey, man, we gotta get goin'.

25:22.619 --> 25:25.253
Uh, don't you guys wanna hang
around and have a beer or something?

25:25.255 --> 25:27.288
I wouldn't mind hangin' for a bit.

25:27.290 --> 25:30.324
- We're all here, but...
- Let's hit it.

25:30.326 --> 25:32.930
We'll let you know how the party goes.

25:33.997 --> 25:36.264
- See y'all.
- Later, Brody.

25:36.266 --> 25:38.667
- Yeah, so...
- What's all this I hear about a party?

25:38.669 --> 25:40.634
- Ah.
- Hey, Johnny.

25:40.636 --> 25:42.938
Joey and Ty are havin' a party
down at the ranch tomorrow,

25:42.940 --> 25:46.006
and I was just tellin' 'em that
I gotta work, not gonna make it.

25:46.008 --> 25:48.642
- Oh, that's too bad.
- Yeah.

25:48.644 --> 25:50.980
I don't remember seein'
your name on the schedule.

25:52.449 --> 25:54.649
Well, I guess we'll be partying, huh?

25:54.651 --> 25:56.817
Looks like it. Sure does.

25:56.819 --> 25:59.219
- Wanna walk me to my car?
- I do. I do, yeah.

25:59.221 --> 26:00.721
- C.J.
- Good to see ya.

26:00.723 --> 26:02.357
- See ya, Brody.
- Nice to meet you.

26:02.359 --> 26:04.793
Nice to meet you.

26:04.795 --> 26:07.963
So, uh, Ricki's workin'
tomorrow. Got the day off.

26:07.965 --> 26:10.998
What do you say we get out on
the road, take a little ride?

26:11.000 --> 26:13.336
That sounds good.

26:28.651 --> 26:33.321
How's it goin'?

26:33.323 --> 26:35.657
So, what do you think?

26:35.659 --> 26:40.894
Well, it's... Hey, it's a nice house.

26:40.896 --> 26:42.930
Actually, I was talkin' about the bike.

26:42.932 --> 26:45.100
The bike?

26:46.937 --> 26:49.169
Oh, that's a beauty, man.

26:49.171 --> 26:51.105
Yeah, it is a badass.

26:51.107 --> 26:55.075
So, what's the deal? You don't live here?

26:55.077 --> 26:57.247
- No, this is...
- Hello, C.J.

27:04.286 --> 27:06.256
Ricki?

27:08.225 --> 27:12.796
Well, didn't think I'd be
seein' you this mornin'.

27:15.198 --> 27:17.364
Funny how things work out, huh?

27:17.366 --> 27:19.769
He didn't tell me you lived here.

27:21.904 --> 27:24.471
Yeah, well, told me y'all
were meetin' at the bar.

27:24.473 --> 27:27.274
Well, I guess I got confused.

27:30.212 --> 27:31.946
Which reminds me, I'll be right back.

27:31.948 --> 27:33.581
No, no, Johnny...

27:33.583 --> 27:35.883
- Ricki, I'm sorry. I didn't mean...
- Yeah...

27:35.885 --> 27:38.218
Look, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...

27:38.220 --> 27:42.792
Yeah, I just... I just wasn't
expecting visitors. That's all.

27:44.594 --> 27:47.064
Nice to see ya.

27:58.141 --> 28:01.141
So, Johnny told me that you were out.

28:01.143 --> 28:06.281
You, uh... You look good.

28:06.283 --> 28:09.353
Thanks. You know, so do you.

28:10.453 --> 28:14.788
You, uh... You never were
much of a liar, you know.

28:14.790 --> 28:17.524
No. No, not really.

28:17.526 --> 28:21.329
I mean, I always knew what
was inside of you. I just...

28:21.331 --> 28:24.532
Guess you just needed
some time to figure it out.

28:24.534 --> 28:26.534
Yeah.

28:26.536 --> 28:28.535
So, how does it feel to be back?

28:28.537 --> 28:31.605
A lot's changed over the years.

28:31.607 --> 28:35.008
Yeah. Probably me the most.

28:35.010 --> 28:36.878
- Hey, Sis?
- Yeah.

28:36.880 --> 28:40.482
- Mind if I borrow your guitar?
- No, of course not.

28:40.484 --> 28:42.217
Thanks.

28:42.219 --> 28:45.285
- You got room in your overhead luggage for that?
- Sure.

28:45.287 --> 28:48.122
- So, what are y'all up to today?
- Just ridin'.

28:48.124 --> 28:51.692
- Mmm.
- Whatever the day brings.

28:51.694 --> 28:54.230
How long you in town for, C.J.?

28:56.298 --> 28:58.999
I, um... I really don't know.

28:59.001 --> 29:01.302
All kinda depends.

29:01.304 --> 29:04.708
Yeah, well, you take
care out there, ya hear?

29:06.375 --> 29:08.545
Always.

29:11.381 --> 29:15.416
Um, I was hopin' we could,

29:15.418 --> 29:17.351
you know, get together sometime soon.

29:17.353 --> 29:21.054
- Catch up.
- Hey. Let's get going.

29:21.056 --> 29:25.325
- I don't have forever.
- Guess we'll just see how things go.

29:25.327 --> 29:27.495
Y'all be careful.

29:27.497 --> 29:30.334
C.J., come over and give me
a hand with this, will you?

31:24.314 --> 31:26.848
So, I heard you quit workin' at the ranch.

31:26.850 --> 31:31.518
Yeah, yeah. I don't know, I just got
tired of my dad thinkin' he owns me.

31:31.520 --> 31:33.821
So... I'm sorry.

31:33.823 --> 31:35.957
I can talk to my dad for you, if you want.

31:35.959 --> 31:38.793
He's sweet. He'll understand.

31:38.795 --> 31:42.162
That's okay. I'll...
I'll figure something out.

31:42.164 --> 31:46.869
All right then. Maybe
you'll figure me out someday.

31:49.205 --> 31:54.244
- Is that what you want?
- I want a lot of things.

31:56.046 --> 31:59.080
Hey, Brody.

31:59.082 --> 32:02.352
What do you say we, uh, take
this party to another level?

32:05.755 --> 32:08.658
All right. What do you wanna do?

32:09.758 --> 32:11.825
Each man gets a barrel.

32:11.827 --> 32:15.530
Three cans. Three shots.

32:15.532 --> 32:18.666
May the best man win.

32:18.668 --> 32:21.502
There's a
hundred-dollar buy-in.

32:21.504 --> 32:24.438
- I'm in.
- I didn't ask you.

32:24.440 --> 32:26.341
You down?

32:26.343 --> 32:29.079
I don't mess with guns, so...

32:30.180 --> 32:32.080
You-You don't mess with guns?

32:32.082 --> 32:35.350
You afraid of a little
friendly competition?

32:35.352 --> 32:37.787
It's too dangerous for you?

32:39.521 --> 32:41.555
- Who's up first?
- All right.

32:41.557 --> 32:43.794
That'll be me.

33:31.240 --> 33:35.177
I said I didn't mess with guns. I
didn't say I didn't know how to use 'em.

33:37.013 --> 33:39.282
All right, double or nothin'.

33:43.952 --> 33:46.455
All right.

33:50.492 --> 33:54.127
Aaah! You son of a bitch!

33:54.129 --> 33:55.696
- No, no, no!
- Break it up!

33:55.698 --> 33:58.598
Break it up. No, step back.

34:00.370 --> 34:02.203
Fuck you, man!

34:02.205 --> 34:04.772
- You're a fuckin' asshole!
- Cool it, y'all.

34:04.774 --> 34:07.208
- Come on, man.
- You think you're somebody 'cause your dad's Gilley?

34:07.210 --> 34:10.444
You spoiled shit.

34:10.446 --> 34:13.149
Brody! Brody.

34:14.650 --> 34:17.051
- He's not worth it.
- This is...

34:17.053 --> 34:20.520
I just need some space right now, Joey.

34:20.522 --> 34:23.359
- I...
- Just talk to you later, all right?

34:57.759 --> 34:59.826
We never should've quit our band.

34:59.828 --> 35:03.998
I know. We were kids.

35:04.000 --> 35:09.737
I still remember those... those bike rides
we used to take with those two hot sisters.

35:09.739 --> 35:12.772
Oh, man.

35:12.774 --> 35:17.111
Ricki was always so jealous when we'd
get home and she'd see them with us.

35:17.113 --> 35:19.846
Yeah. Well, it's 'cause she loved you.

35:19.848 --> 35:22.616
I know.

35:22.618 --> 35:26.786
So, how was it seein' Ricki after
all these years, this mornin'?

35:26.788 --> 35:31.091
Well, aside from the fact that
she still takes my breath away...

35:31.093 --> 35:33.529
No kiddin', huh?

35:34.631 --> 35:39.799
It was, uh... It was awkward.

35:39.801 --> 35:41.902
Not like I imagined it'd be.

35:41.904 --> 35:44.971
Yeah, what did you expect?

35:44.973 --> 35:48.911
She's been hurt... more than once.

35:51.948 --> 35:54.884
- She's still married to Wade?
- Oh, God, no.

35:56.285 --> 35:59.252
They got divorced about... oh,
I don't know... six years ago.

35:59.254 --> 36:01.321
But it was over long before that.

36:01.323 --> 36:03.056
Never should've got
married in the first place.

36:03.058 --> 36:06.826
Wade was her rebound from
you, and everybody knew it.

36:06.828 --> 36:11.498
Even him. Wade's had a hard-on
for Ricki ever since she left him.

36:11.500 --> 36:13.067
Brody get caught in the fallout?

36:13.069 --> 36:14.835
Pretty much.

36:14.837 --> 36:19.839
Brody and him are like dry grass and
gasoline, you know... buttin' heads.

36:19.841 --> 36:22.310
Wade's got a rich business
partner, Gilley Daniels.

36:22.312 --> 36:25.478
They're buyin' up all these
ranches and properties around town.

36:25.480 --> 36:27.582
They even own the friggin' bank.

36:27.584 --> 36:29.150
That a problem?

36:29.152 --> 36:32.420
Well, it is when they hold
the mortgage on our bar.

36:32.422 --> 36:34.621
Been behind on my payments
for a little while now,

36:34.623 --> 36:38.658
and those two are just sittin' there like
a couple of vultures, waitin' to swoop in...

36:38.660 --> 36:41.862
and foreclose.

36:41.864 --> 36:46.801
Yeah, Wade served notice yesterday.

36:46.803 --> 36:48.835
Where does that leave you and Ricki?

36:48.837 --> 36:51.938
Close to broke, with a pile of debt.

36:51.940 --> 36:55.308
I'm sorry.

36:55.310 --> 36:57.446
So, you wanna tell me why you're here?

37:00.350 --> 37:03.884
It was just time, I guess.

37:03.886 --> 37:08.188
I've been away from
Banshee over half my life.

37:08.190 --> 37:12.560
- It wasn't the better half.
- You walked out on a lot of people back then, you know?

37:12.562 --> 37:15.129
Your family, your mama.

37:15.131 --> 37:19.169
- Your friends.
- I know.

37:21.870 --> 37:23.872
So now what?

37:25.841 --> 37:28.010
I'm not sure.

37:32.214 --> 37:35.348
I'm sorry, Johnny.

37:35.350 --> 37:40.321
Yeah, I know. I know you're sorry.

37:40.323 --> 37:43.690
Lot of folks take off to see the world.

37:43.692 --> 37:47.194
Leave the familiar behind.

37:47.196 --> 37:50.433
Lot of folks come back home too.

37:51.500 --> 37:54.002
Why don't you give that to Ricki for me.

37:58.774 --> 38:01.944
You've done enough matchmaking for one day.

38:04.080 --> 38:06.614
You know, the older I
get, the more I realize...

38:06.616 --> 38:10.786
it's the relationships in this
world that matter the most.

38:12.288 --> 38:15.022
But we come into this world
alone and we check out alone.

38:15.024 --> 38:20.226
And in between, I believe, we're
meant to be with each other.

38:20.228 --> 38:23.632
You've been doin' as much
soul-searchin' as I have lately.

38:25.935 --> 38:28.636
Probably so.

38:28.638 --> 38:30.640
Hey.

38:37.714 --> 38:40.450
I'm dyin', C.J.

38:41.616 --> 38:43.620
What?

38:45.754 --> 38:48.957
Johnny, what are you sayin', man?

38:52.761 --> 38:55.429
Cancer.

38:55.431 --> 38:57.433
Johnny...

39:03.004 --> 39:06.306
Ain't that a fuckin' pisser?

39:06.308 --> 39:09.109
But I'm not gonna have
tubes runnin' down my throat,

39:09.111 --> 39:11.411
needles in my arms, C.J.

39:11.413 --> 39:13.850
Some stranger wipin' my ass.

39:14.951 --> 39:17.817
That ain't my style.

39:17.819 --> 39:20.353
- Johnny...
- Promise me you'll take care of her.

39:20.355 --> 39:22.623
Johnny, just come over
here and sit down, man.

39:22.625 --> 39:25.525
I've always loved you,
C.J., just like a brother.

39:25.527 --> 39:28.027
Johnny, there's a truck comin', man.

39:28.029 --> 39:29.631
Johnny!

39:31.200 --> 39:33.203
Johnny!

39:45.314 --> 39:48.817
C.J.... Where's...

40:02.564 --> 40:04.566
It's Johnny.

40:15.977 --> 40:18.978
His arm started goin' numb. That was it.

40:18.980 --> 40:21.047
Point where he couldn't even raise it.

40:21.049 --> 40:22.683
Thanks.

40:22.685 --> 40:25.719
- He just kept sayin' it was from workin' too much.
- Yeah.

40:25.721 --> 40:27.721
He was so damn stubborn.

40:27.723 --> 40:32.192
It was only till he collapsed one night
at work that he agreed to see a doctor.

40:32.194 --> 40:33.761
Thank you.

40:33.763 --> 40:36.596
Stage IV leukemia.

40:36.598 --> 40:39.433
Spread throughout his entire body, so...

40:39.435 --> 40:41.601
Just a matter of time.

40:41.603 --> 40:44.573
He made us promise not to tell nobody.

40:45.741 --> 40:47.274
So, uh,

40:47.276 --> 40:51.277
Mom and I just did what
we could to help out.

40:51.279 --> 40:53.580
Yeah.

40:53.582 --> 40:55.882
He sent me a telegram.

40:55.884 --> 40:58.620
Said it was urgent and I should get back.

41:01.390 --> 41:05.060
Well, now you know why.

41:07.363 --> 41:11.899
- I'm glad you were with him in the end.
- Mm-mmm.

41:11.901 --> 41:14.368
No, in the end, he should've
been with his family.

41:14.370 --> 41:16.973
The people who loved him.

41:22.377 --> 41:24.379
He, uh...

41:25.614 --> 41:29.384
He gave me this before he passed.

41:30.785 --> 41:33.055
Said I should give it to you.

41:36.725 --> 41:40.560
- Well, how honorable.
- Mom.

41:40.562 --> 41:43.332
It's all right, Brody.

41:47.837 --> 41:49.839
You gonna open it?

42:05.855 --> 42:08.925
I can't read this.

42:14.297 --> 42:16.299
"Dearest Ricki,

42:18.100 --> 42:20.366
If you're reading this
letter, it means I've moved on.

42:20.368 --> 42:24.272
And I hope you know how
much I love you and Brody.

42:25.942 --> 42:29.042
It also means C.J. was there
to give this letter to you.

42:29.044 --> 42:33.346
I know old wounds are slow to heal, but...

42:33.348 --> 42:38.553
I hope you find it in your heart to see
in C.J. what you saw all those years ago.

42:40.556 --> 42:44.961
And C.J., if you're listenin', the
only thing I have to say is this:

42:46.629 --> 42:48.864
Take care of my family for me.

42:51.232 --> 42:56.069
Love to you all. Johnny."

42:56.071 --> 42:58.073
What happened between you two?

42:59.575 --> 43:04.210
- It doesn't matter now.
- What's done is done.

43:04.212 --> 43:06.181
It's complicated.

43:07.817 --> 43:10.319
Don't y'all think I kinda deserve to know?

43:17.359 --> 43:19.361
Before you were born,

43:21.730 --> 43:24.565
- when your mom and I were kids...
- Please.

43:24.567 --> 43:28.671
You'd think enough scabs have
been torn open for one day.

43:30.239 --> 43:32.575
Tell me, C.J.

43:37.245 --> 43:39.247
- Your mom and I...
- C.J.

43:42.118 --> 43:44.851
- We were...
- That is enough, damn it. That is enough.

43:44.853 --> 43:46.953
- Now, I want you out of...
- He's only trying to explain.

43:46.955 --> 43:49.057
Please, leave.

43:50.359 --> 43:52.527
Just go.

43:53.562 --> 43:55.565
Okay.

44:10.446 --> 44:13.482
Mom...

44:19.087 --> 44:22.156
Hey, C.J.! C.J., wait up.

44:22.158 --> 44:25.292
Hey, listen. She didn't mean
what she said back there.

44:25.294 --> 44:26.893
Okay, she's just upset, is all.

44:26.895 --> 44:29.562
She's got a right to be.

44:29.564 --> 44:31.998
I'm not a good man, Brody.

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
I don't believe that, C.J.

44:34.002 --> 44:36.338
And I know Johnny didn't.

44:38.640 --> 44:40.507
Well, hey, where you goin'?

44:40.509 --> 44:43.509
Same place I've always gone.

44:43.511 --> 44:45.515
Nowhere.

44:59.861 --> 45:03.663
What the hell just
happened back there, Mom?

45:03.665 --> 45:05.699
I mean, what is it with you two?

45:05.701 --> 45:08.134
It's been, what, 20 years
since you seen each other?

45:08.136 --> 45:10.703
- Why'd you treat him like that?
- 'Cause...

45:10.705 --> 45:12.705
Because why, Mom?

45:12.707 --> 45:15.341
Did he hurt you, do something wrong, what?

45:15.343 --> 45:18.045
Mom?

45:18.047 --> 45:21.317
Because... he's your father.

45:30.960 --> 45:33.627
- You know, Dad told me to ask you two why you broke up.
- Oh...

45:33.629 --> 45:36.464
It was the least of the reasons why.

45:37.799 --> 45:41.467
Well, does he know?

45:41.469 --> 45:43.536
- Who?
- C.J., Mom. Does he know?

45:43.538 --> 45:45.806
- I don't know. What does it matter?
- Hell, yes, it matters.

45:45.808 --> 45:48.678
- It matters to me.
- No... No, he doesn't know.

45:50.879 --> 45:54.882
All right?

45:54.884 --> 45:57.386
God, Mom, you know? I love you.

45:59.020 --> 46:00.821
But damn you and your pride.

46:35.790 --> 46:37.891
Mom.

46:37.893 --> 46:41.060
I'm, uh, here today to...

46:41.062 --> 46:43.732
tell you how sorry I am.

46:45.100 --> 46:48.634
I'm more than the love I wasted...

46:48.636 --> 46:51.638
and the hurt I caused.

46:51.640 --> 46:54.775
I just pray you forgive me.

46:54.777 --> 46:59.215
Maybe look down on me, let
me know you're still with me.

47:02.250 --> 47:04.754
You're gone.

47:07.256 --> 47:09.759
And Johnny's gone.

47:12.660 --> 47:14.663
And I'm pretty much lost.

47:16.631 --> 47:18.834
I love you.

48:29.004 --> 48:31.237
Ray Jennings?

48:31.239 --> 48:33.209
Who's askin'?

48:42.183 --> 48:44.185
Hello, C.J.

48:46.754 --> 48:48.587
How you been doin'?

48:48.589 --> 48:51.559
Why don't we go and skip
the pleasantries, huh?

48:53.928 --> 48:55.930
Fair enough.

48:59.567 --> 49:05.507
- Well, you want a soda pop or somethin'?
- No.

49:06.875 --> 49:09.775
Well, you're here.

49:09.777 --> 49:14.580
- What now?
- That's a good question for you, isn't it?

49:14.582 --> 49:18.018
Yes, it is.

49:18.020 --> 49:22.190
- This was a bad idea.
- I know what you're feeling.

49:24.426 --> 49:29.698
Regret. I've lived with that for 40 years.

49:31.533 --> 49:34.134
Back then, I'd have got on
that chopper, cranked it up...

49:34.136 --> 49:37.571
and driven as far as I
could go away from here.

49:37.573 --> 49:40.774
It's a lot easier to run
away from the problem...

49:40.776 --> 49:45.212
than it is to face it head on
and take a chance on gettin' hurt.

49:45.214 --> 49:50.583
But at the end of the day,
all you're left with is...

49:50.585 --> 49:53.587
emptiness.

49:53.589 --> 49:56.725
And that goddamn regret.

49:58.627 --> 50:00.763
You know, uh,

50:02.464 --> 50:05.966
Mom used to tell me stories about you.

50:05.968 --> 50:08.902
What a good man you were.

50:08.904 --> 50:11.138
How you loved us.

50:11.140 --> 50:13.073
How you were off fightin' the war,

50:13.075 --> 50:15.310
defendin' this country.

50:17.145 --> 50:19.846
And then one day,

50:19.848 --> 50:22.783
you were home.

50:22.785 --> 50:25.286
And I finally had my dad with me.

50:26.622 --> 50:29.455
I still got that one picture...

50:29.457 --> 50:31.958
Mama took of us,

50:31.960 --> 50:34.493
when we went to see Grandpa.

50:34.495 --> 50:36.498
I remember.

50:38.634 --> 50:40.870
And then one day,

50:42.504 --> 50:47.674
you were gone again, and Mom
made all kinds of excuses for ya.

50:47.676 --> 50:50.846
Until there weren't any excuses left.

50:58.953 --> 51:01.821
For a lot of years,

51:01.823 --> 51:06.225
I blamed all my problems on the war...

51:06.227 --> 51:10.362
why I left you and your mom...

51:10.364 --> 51:14.067
basically everything.

51:14.069 --> 51:19.038
I found my comfort in
the bottom of a bottle.

51:19.040 --> 51:25.212
Truth of the matter was,
I was a goddamn coward.

51:25.214 --> 51:29.183
Afraid of failin' as
a husband and a father.

51:30.852 --> 51:33.987
If I could go back...

51:33.989 --> 51:37.359
and give myself one piece of advice,

51:38.493 --> 51:40.826
it'd be this:

51:40.828 --> 51:45.765
You don't have to be a great
man and a good provider...

51:45.767 --> 51:49.605
to be a good father, husband.

51:54.542 --> 51:56.945
You just have to be there.

52:29.578 --> 52:31.614
Hey, Brody.

52:32.948 --> 52:34.917
We need to talk.

52:59.473 --> 53:02.141
I went by your place.

53:02.143 --> 53:04.647
Who gave you the key to get in?

53:10.352 --> 53:12.488
Our son.

53:16.825 --> 53:19.426
Ah, I suppose you had to find out somehow.

53:19.428 --> 53:22.929
Why didn't you tell me? My
God, maybe I would have just...

53:22.931 --> 53:26.098
Do what? What, stayed? No.

53:26.100 --> 53:29.835
I told myself a long time ago that if
you stayed, it would be because of me,

53:29.837 --> 53:31.605
and not for the right reasons.

53:31.607 --> 53:34.674
It's just a choice I made
a long time ago, so...

53:34.676 --> 53:36.679
You're right.

53:38.680 --> 53:41.283
You didn't owe me anything back then.

53:42.384 --> 53:46.152
I'm the one that walked away from you.

53:46.154 --> 53:48.487
But you've gotta believe
me... I've changed.

53:48.489 --> 53:51.558
And I want to be a part of your life.

53:51.560 --> 53:55.295
We're not kids anymore, C.J.
We can't just... go back.

53:55.297 --> 53:57.533
I know that.

53:58.734 --> 54:02.738
I'm sorry.

54:04.806 --> 54:06.672
Listen.

54:06.674 --> 54:09.643
Listen to me. Johnny
asked me to look after you.

54:09.645 --> 54:11.344
- Oh. C.J.
- And that's what I'm gonna do.

54:11.346 --> 54:14.980
It's not because I have to.

54:14.982 --> 54:18.018
It's because I want to.

54:18.020 --> 54:21.920
So, if that just means being friends,

54:21.922 --> 54:23.926
so be it.

54:25.259 --> 54:28.027
Either way,

54:28.029 --> 54:30.765
I'm stayin'.

54:53.721 --> 54:57.024
Well, that about does it.

54:58.794 --> 55:01.027
Hey, you don't gotta do this tonight.

55:01.029 --> 55:03.062
No.

55:03.064 --> 55:05.431
Johnny would have wanted it this way.

55:07.368 --> 55:08.967
I guess so.

55:12.573 --> 55:14.742
Come here.

55:20.448 --> 55:23.882
Well, I guess the word's out about Johnny.

55:23.884 --> 55:27.953
'Cause that whole
parkin' lot is fillin' up.

How'd you find me?

01:00:11.538 --> 01:00:16.009
I stopped by the motel.
They told me you checked out.

01:00:16.011 --> 01:00:18.411
I figured you were one of two places.

01:00:18.413 --> 01:00:23.051

Brody.

Key to the house.

01:02:33.814 --> 01:02:36.181
You're welcome anytime, all right?

01:02:36.183 --> 01:02:38.317
Make yourself at home.

01:02:38.319 --> 01:02:41.853
- You and I got a lot of catching up to do.
- All right. Thank you.

01:02:41.855 --> 01:02:43.922
You're welcome.

01:02:43.924 --> 01:02:45.658
- Be careful.
- All right. Thanks.

01:02:45.660 --> 01:02:47.192
- Good.
- So long, C.J. Thanks a lot.

01:02:47.194 --> 01:02:49.196
- See you around.
- All right. Mom.

01:02:52.533 --> 01:02:55.268
He's a hell of a kid.

01:02:55.270 --> 01:02:57.370
Did a good job with him.

01:02:57.372 --> 01:03:00.339
Well, he comes from good stock. It helps.

01:03:03.243 --> 01:03:05.344
Well, I better get goin' as well.

01:03:05.346 --> 01:03:07.245
I'll see you later tonight?

01:03:07.247 --> 01:03:12.451
Yeah. And every night after that.

01:03:12.453 --> 01:03:15.520
I'll be there by openin'.
Got a few things to do first.

Hey there, Ricki.

01:03:35.944 --> 01:03:39.714
- Son.
- Doesn't look like it, does it?

01:03:41.248 --> 01:03:44.549
- So the cat's finally out of the bag, is it?
- What do you want, Wade?

01:03:44.551 --> 01:03:48.087
I figured your last visit would buy me at
least a week before you came by to gloat.

01:03:48.089 --> 01:03:50.989
On the contrary, I came to pay my respects.

01:03:50.991 --> 01:03:52.924
Real sorry about Johnny.

01:03:52.926 --> 01:03:58.897
He and I had our differences,
but he was a good man nonetheless.

01:03:58.899 --> 01:04:01.801
Thank you.

01:04:01.803 --> 01:04:03.902
Why don't you give me a shot of tequila.

01:04:03.904 --> 01:04:05.670
Good stuff. None of that cheap shit.

01:04:05.672 --> 01:04:08.940
- You good, Mom?
- It's fine, Brody.

01:04:08.942 --> 01:04:10.944
Now what?

01:04:12.346 --> 01:04:14.513
Look,

01:04:14.515 --> 01:04:16.781
I know we've been a little strained lately.

01:04:16.783 --> 01:04:18.951
Johnny's death got me to thinking.

01:04:18.953 --> 01:04:21.487
You mean about someone other than yourself?

01:04:21.489 --> 01:04:23.491
You think this is easy for me?

01:04:25.192 --> 01:04:27.259
I'm sorry.

01:04:27.261 --> 01:04:29.363
It's all right.

01:04:30.431 --> 01:04:34.533
Anyway, I mean, what you gonna
do when this place goes under?

01:04:34.535 --> 01:04:37.136
- Where you gonna go?
- Okay, Wade.

01:04:37.138 --> 01:04:40.038
I'm perfectly capable of taking
care of myself, thank you very much.

01:04:40.040 --> 01:04:42.142
Let me finish.

01:04:46.881 --> 01:04:49.484
What's that?

01:04:51.051 --> 01:04:53.953
This is $25,000.

01:05:08.736 --> 01:05:12.071
"Made payable the day the
bar gets foreclosed on."

01:05:12.073 --> 01:05:14.140
Why am I not surprised?

01:05:14.142 --> 01:05:15.975
Hey, it'll help you get back on your feet.

01:05:15.977 --> 01:05:18.511
Should've known your intentions were
more than an actual stab at sincerity.

01:05:18.513 --> 01:05:21.846
Listen, personally, I think Johnny
would agree with me on this one.

01:05:21.848 --> 01:05:24.150
Well, you didn't know
Johnny very well, did you?

01:05:24.152 --> 01:05:27.386
'Cause he would've kicked your ass out
of here the moment you made the offer.

01:05:27.388 --> 01:05:30.989
Well, guess what? Johnny's
not here, now, is he?

01:05:30.991 --> 01:05:34.092
You've gotta get out from
under this mountain of debt.

01:05:34.094 --> 01:05:36.495
You really don't have any options.

01:05:36.497 --> 01:05:38.832
Well, she's got one.

01:05:40.167 --> 01:05:44.402
Oh. Well, look what the dust blew in.

01:05:44.404 --> 01:05:49.442
Man, I heard you were back in town.
I just did not want to believe it.

01:05:49.444 --> 01:05:53.346
- Mind if I join you?
- Hey, Ricki and I were just conducting a little business.

01:05:53.348 --> 01:05:55.748
I wasn't talking to you, was I?

01:05:55.750 --> 01:05:59.719
I was askin' Ricki.

01:05:59.721 --> 01:06:01.420
- Yeah. Please do.
- You know what?

01:06:01.422 --> 01:06:04.589
You can invite the whole
dang bar if you want to.

01:06:04.591 --> 01:06:06.192
It's not gonna change a thing.

01:06:06.194 --> 01:06:08.694
Twenty-seven days, this
place is gonna be mine.

01:06:08.696 --> 01:06:11.429
This offer right here?

01:06:11.431 --> 01:06:13.565
It ends when I stand up.

01:06:13.567 --> 01:06:17.136
Yeah. About that.

01:06:17.138 --> 01:06:19.707
What's that?

01:06:21.209 --> 01:06:24.542
It's, uh, back payment on the mortgage.

01:06:24.544 --> 01:06:26.879
Should be enough there to get him cryin'.

01:06:26.881 --> 01:06:30.082
Oh, boy, you've been
livin' in a hole, hoss.

01:06:30.084 --> 01:06:32.551
Why would I think this check's any good?

01:06:32.553 --> 01:06:34.922
From your bank.

01:06:36.823 --> 01:06:38.924
You know what? You don't
have the authority...

01:06:38.926 --> 01:06:41.993
I don't need your permission,
Wade, to pay off a debt.

01:06:41.995 --> 01:06:44.730
Okay?

01:06:44.732 --> 01:06:47.732
Especially for my partner.

01:06:47.734 --> 01:06:49.636
What do you say?

01:06:53.408 --> 01:06:56.141
Works for me.

01:06:56.143 --> 01:06:57.743
Well, good.

01:06:57.745 --> 01:07:00.913
There's $50,000 there
made out to your bank...

01:07:00.915 --> 01:07:02.848
from your bank, so...

01:07:02.850 --> 01:07:05.118
you can just run off and cash it.

01:07:09.089 --> 01:07:12.290
I believe that's your cue to take it...

01:07:12.292 --> 01:07:15.761
and get the hell out of here.

01:07:15.763 --> 01:07:17.699
Good stuff.

01:07:25.205 --> 01:07:28.774
You know, you have no idea what
you've gotten yourself into.

01:07:28.776 --> 01:07:30.842
You're right.

01:07:30.844 --> 01:07:34.314
I should have gotten myself
into this a long time ago.

01:07:46.727 --> 01:07:48.726
What was that about?

01:07:48.728 --> 01:07:52.964
Oh. C.J.... just became my partner.

01:07:52.966 --> 01:07:55.167
He gave your father...

01:07:55.169 --> 01:07:58.571
He gave Wade the money
owed for the back payments.

01:07:58.573 --> 01:08:00.405
Where'd you get that kind of money?

01:08:00.407 --> 01:08:02.508
I, uh... I borrowed it.

01:08:02.510 --> 01:08:05.477
Used my mom's house as collateral.

01:08:05.479 --> 01:08:08.414
Oh, no, no. I wish... I
wish you hadn't done that.

01:08:08.416 --> 01:08:10.348
This place is old.

01:08:10.350 --> 01:08:13.252
It needs a lot of work. I mean...

01:08:13.254 --> 01:08:15.855
What if things don't work
out? I mean, then what?

01:08:15.857 --> 01:08:17.890
Then you've lost everything.

01:08:17.892 --> 01:08:20.325
I've slept under the stars a million times.

01:08:20.327 --> 01:08:22.093
I can do it again.

01:08:22.095 --> 01:08:25.163
And now that I am your new partner,

01:08:25.166 --> 01:08:28.267
I got a couple of ideas
I wanna run by y'all.

01:08:28.269 --> 01:08:30.868
Ladies and gentlemen...

01:08:30.871 --> 01:08:32.871
And y'all know who you are.

01:08:32.872 --> 01:08:34.939
I would like to welcome you all...

01:08:34.942 --> 01:08:39.544
to the first annual Thriftstore
Cowboy Wet T-shirt Contest!

01:08:44.952 --> 01:08:48.256
Now, if y'all are ready,
let's get this party started.

01:08:55.462 --> 01:08:57.962
Yeah, you can read the
menu, but don't touch.

01:08:57.965 --> 01:08:59.631
Oh, don't you worry about it.

01:08:59.634 --> 01:09:02.100
Yeah, you said it, boy. We do
all right in the country, huh?

01:09:02.103 --> 01:09:04.801
Shit, yeah.

01:09:04.804 --> 01:09:08.975
Be right back. Keep
your gun in your holster.

01:09:10.443 --> 01:09:13.712
Love you. I love you both.

01:09:13.714 --> 01:09:16.548
- C.J. Jennings.
- Kyle Rich.

01:09:16.550 --> 01:09:19.584
- How you doin', man?
- Oh, still standin'. I can't complain.

01:09:19.586 --> 01:09:22.654
Uh, I heard you was back in town.

01:09:22.657 --> 01:09:24.255
Yeah, here I am.

01:09:24.256 --> 01:09:27.560
I guess I haven't seen you
since... what, high school?

01:09:27.562 --> 01:09:29.727
Yeah? Somethin' like that.

01:09:32.599 --> 01:09:34.600
Look at that.

01:09:34.602 --> 01:09:36.801
So you're the, uh, sheriff, huh?

01:09:36.804 --> 01:09:40.673
Fifteen years later, this
town won't let me quit.

01:09:40.675 --> 01:09:42.908
What you doin', Kyle?
Still riggin' elections?

01:09:42.910 --> 01:09:45.343
Oh, kiss my ass.

01:09:45.345 --> 01:09:47.812
Look, I can see you're busy.

01:09:47.814 --> 01:09:50.082
- I just thought I'd say hey.
- Yeah.

01:09:50.084 --> 01:09:52.450
Why don't we get together some time?

01:09:52.452 --> 01:09:55.588
- I'll bet you got some stories.
- Yeah? Quite a few.

01:09:55.590 --> 01:09:57.289
I'll just bet.

01:09:57.291 --> 01:09:59.293
- Take care.
- Good to see you.

01:10:02.929 --> 01:10:05.265
- Hey, C.J.
- Hey, Tanya.

01:10:09.036 --> 01:10:11.536
- Two, please.
- Sure. Yeah.

01:10:11.538 --> 01:10:14.373
- Well, it looks like your plan worked.
- Yeah, yeah.

01:10:14.375 --> 01:10:17.642
I tell you what... I like
a man who can think, like me.

01:10:17.644 --> 01:10:19.777
Well, you got the girls here from Austin,

01:10:19.779 --> 01:10:21.446
so good job.

01:10:21.448 --> 01:10:23.816
Mm-hmm. So what are you doin' later?

01:10:23.818 --> 01:10:26.051
Um, workin'.

01:10:26.053 --> 01:10:29.120
Well, what do you say,
when you're done workin',

01:10:29.122 --> 01:10:31.123
you and I go get a drink?

01:10:31.125 --> 01:10:34.727
I probably have one too
many drinks after work,

01:10:34.729 --> 01:10:37.295
but I appreciate it.

01:10:37.297 --> 01:10:39.164
All right.

01:10:39.166 --> 01:10:42.034
You just let me know
if you change your mind.

01:10:42.036 --> 01:10:46.340
I, uh, got to probably get a
little work done. Excuse me.

01:10:54.247 --> 01:10:56.548
Hey, Brody.

01:10:56.550 --> 01:10:59.718
Hey, Ricki. It's going good, huh?

01:10:59.720 --> 01:11:02.557
Yeah. Appears that way.

01:11:04.024 --> 01:11:06.325
Hey.

01:11:06.327 --> 01:11:09.061
Tanya's a nice girl, right?

01:11:09.063 --> 01:11:11.396
But I'm here for you.

01:11:11.398 --> 01:11:13.999
Don't give me that face. Come on.

01:11:18.072 --> 01:11:20.004
One more?

01:11:20.006 --> 01:11:21.406
- One.
- One for you?

01:11:21.408 --> 01:11:22.740
- Ricki.
- What's the problem?

01:11:22.742 --> 01:11:24.743
- Water's out in the women's restroom.
- Really?

01:11:24.745 --> 01:11:27.178
- Mom.
- Let me guess. Water's out.

01:11:27.180 --> 01:11:29.414
Yeah.

01:11:29.416 --> 01:11:33.352
All right. We can use the five-gallon
jugs of drinking water in the storage room.

01:11:33.354 --> 01:11:35.253
- I got it.
- That oughta get us through the night.

01:11:35.255 --> 01:11:38.856
And, uh, we'll just figure
out things in the morning.

01:11:38.858 --> 01:11:43.294
- All right.
- Yeah, we'll check it out in the next break.

01:11:43.296 --> 01:11:45.732
Here you go, sir.

01:11:59.447 --> 01:12:03.749
Well, I gotta tell you.

01:12:03.751 --> 01:12:05.484
This is out of my league.

01:12:05.486 --> 01:12:08.920
Johnny had the pipes looked
at a few days ago, but...

01:12:08.922 --> 01:12:12.790
he said a plumber wasn't available
for at least a couple of weeks.

01:12:12.792 --> 01:12:14.892
He the only one in town?

01:12:14.894 --> 01:12:18.463
Well, he's the only one who
actually knows what he's doin'.

01:12:18.465 --> 01:12:20.798
Well,

01:12:20.800 --> 01:12:24.335
I got an idea of somebody
that can maybe help us.

01:12:33.613 --> 01:12:36.917
That's a damn good way to get shot!

01:12:45.626 --> 01:12:48.129
Rumor has it you're a plumber.

01:12:54.635 --> 01:12:56.802
Here it is.

01:12:56.804 --> 01:13:00.705
Well, let's see what we got here.

01:13:00.707 --> 01:13:03.344
That's where your mainline comes in.

01:13:04.377 --> 01:13:07.678
- So?
- So...

01:13:07.680 --> 01:13:11.482
we play like a couple
of half-ass surgeons...

01:13:11.484 --> 01:13:13.451
and do a bypass.

01:13:13.453 --> 01:13:15.320
That oughta keep you in business...

01:13:15.322 --> 01:13:19.857
till we can get the whole place re-piped.

01:13:19.859 --> 01:13:21.459
Tell me what to do.

01:13:21.461 --> 01:13:26.130
I've got some old scrub pipe
and some PVC in the truck.

01:13:26.132 --> 01:13:29.368
Let me see what I can rig out of that.

01:13:29.370 --> 01:13:30.902
Need a hand?

01:13:30.904 --> 01:13:33.808
Yeah. Let's go get it.

01:13:48.755 --> 01:13:51.557
- Hey, Joey.
- Hey.

01:13:51.559 --> 01:13:54.058
Just wanted to see how you were doin'.

01:13:54.060 --> 01:13:56.994
Hadn't heard from you since the other day.

01:13:56.996 --> 01:13:59.030
It's like 2:00 in the mornin'.

01:13:59.032 --> 01:14:02.269
- That looks sore.
- Yeah.

01:14:04.104 --> 01:14:07.241
Well, what are you doin' here?

01:14:08.541 --> 01:14:11.442
You're a smart guy. You tell me.

01:14:13.112 --> 01:14:15.547
I'm sorry Ty was such a jerk the other day.

01:14:15.549 --> 01:14:17.716
Can only take so much of him and Jake.

01:14:17.718 --> 01:14:20.451
Yeah. That makes two of us.

01:14:20.453 --> 01:14:22.353
So...

01:14:22.355 --> 01:14:27.025
are you just gonna stand there,
or are you gonna invite me in?

01:14:27.027 --> 01:14:30.628
Uh, I-I would love to...

01:14:30.630 --> 01:14:32.431
No. Hey, no, it's not that.

01:14:32.433 --> 01:14:35.100
I-It's... It's just
this is my mom's place.

01:14:35.102 --> 01:14:37.969
You don't have to explain it to me.

01:14:37.971 --> 01:14:39.804
I still live with my dad at the ranch.

01:14:39.806 --> 01:14:42.274
Yeah, well, I, you know...

01:14:45.112 --> 01:14:47.448
You wanna go for a walk?

01:14:50.451 --> 01:14:53.384
Or a drive.

01:14:53.386 --> 01:14:55.389
All right.

01:14:57.558 --> 01:15:02.127
- Lived in Banshee your whole life?
- No, no.

01:15:02.129 --> 01:15:06.231
I've had more addresses
than a call girl has tricks.

01:15:06.233 --> 01:15:08.933
Two years ago, I retired and...

01:15:08.935 --> 01:15:11.438
moved back here.

01:15:14.474 --> 01:15:17.142
So...

01:15:17.144 --> 01:15:20.147
what made you start
writin' me those letters?

01:15:25.318 --> 01:15:30.289
A lifetime of regret and your mom.

01:15:30.291 --> 01:15:32.290
- Mom?
- Yeah.

01:15:32.292 --> 01:15:37.262
After I got back here, I decided I
should get in touch with her and...

01:15:37.264 --> 01:15:42.502
try to make up for all
the... pain I'd caused her.

01:15:44.772 --> 01:15:51.112
Then... took me a long
time to work up the nerve.

01:15:52.179 --> 01:15:54.946
Finally, I called her,

01:15:54.948 --> 01:15:57.848
and, uh...

01:15:57.850 --> 01:15:59.951
she couldn't have been nicer.

01:15:59.953 --> 01:16:03.155
All that pain I'd caused her.

01:16:03.157 --> 01:16:09.460
She... acted like she'd
found a long-lost friend.

01:16:09.462 --> 01:16:12.798
All along I'd had a woman like that,

01:16:12.800 --> 01:16:15.036
and I was too thick to know it.

01:16:16.636 --> 01:16:18.971
Anyway, the next day,

01:16:18.973 --> 01:16:22.574
I went, uh, by her house,

01:16:22.576 --> 01:16:25.076
knocked on the door.

01:16:25.078 --> 01:16:27.081
No answer.

01:16:28.983 --> 01:16:31.318
Turned to leave.

01:16:32.685 --> 01:16:38.990
One of her neighbors came out and said
she'd passed away the night before.

01:16:38.992 --> 01:16:40.993
One minute she was there,

01:16:40.995 --> 01:16:44.564
the next minute, gone.

01:16:49.336 --> 01:16:52.003
I spent all those years, and
I could have been making up...

01:16:52.005 --> 01:16:54.507
for what I'd done to her.

01:16:57.344 --> 01:17:00.745
You're old a lot longer
than you're young, C.J.

01:17:00.747 --> 01:17:04.117
I wasted so much time.

01:17:05.618 --> 01:17:09.589
I didn't want to have the
same regrets about you.

01:17:18.564 --> 01:17:21.134
It's all right, Dad.

01:17:35.248 --> 01:17:37.816
Well, this is it.

01:17:37.818 --> 01:17:40.651
Whose place is this?

01:17:40.653 --> 01:17:42.656
My dad's.

01:17:43.956 --> 01:17:45.891
Wade lives here?

01:17:45.893 --> 01:17:48.893
C.J.

01:17:48.895 --> 01:17:51.762
Long story.

01:17:51.764 --> 01:17:55.167
Uh, he's not home,

01:17:55.169 --> 01:17:59.406
but, uh, he left the key.

01:18:00.773 --> 01:18:03.977
Is he, um, cool?

01:18:05.813 --> 01:18:08.282
I'm pretty sure of that.

01:18:20.193 --> 01:18:23.195
This pipe is loose from the wall.

01:18:23.197 --> 01:18:25.262
- Shouldn't be any give, should there?
- No.

01:18:25.264 --> 01:18:27.833
No, there shouldn't be anything
on the other side of that wall...

01:18:27.835 --> 01:18:30.435
but rock and dirt.

01:18:30.437 --> 01:18:33.774
- What do you think?
- Hell if I know.

01:18:38.845 --> 01:18:40.811
There's air comin' out of these holes.

01:18:40.813 --> 01:18:42.646
Wait a minute.

01:18:42.648 --> 01:18:46.886
Look, these holes have been
drilled from the inside.

01:18:49.723 --> 01:18:52.626
- God.
- What?

01:18:53.794 --> 01:18:56.229
There's light comin' back from there.

01:19:53.953 --> 01:19:56.256
Son of a bitch.

01:20:03.529 --> 01:20:06.032
This ain't no water cavity.

01:20:07.367 --> 01:20:09.803
Let's find out what this is.

01:20:49.142 --> 01:20:52.077
Ray. Ray!

01:20:54.648 --> 01:20:56.948
Ray.

01:20:56.950 --> 01:20:58.482
You all right?

01:20:58.484 --> 01:21:02.820
I can think of more fun
ways of bondin' with my son.

01:21:02.822 --> 01:21:04.755
Where in the hell are we?

01:21:04.757 --> 01:21:07.592
I got no idea.

01:21:07.594 --> 01:21:10.361
Last thing I remember...

01:21:10.363 --> 01:21:13.366
we were breakin' that
wall out in the basement.

01:21:17.136 --> 01:21:19.540
Evenin', gents.

01:21:24.010 --> 01:21:26.777
Seems you boys picked the wrong time...

01:21:26.779 --> 01:21:29.481
to go stickin' your noses
where they don't belong.

01:21:29.483 --> 01:21:32.284
How long you known about the tunnel?

01:21:32.286 --> 01:21:35.322
That's why you wanted to bail Ricki out.

01:21:38.858 --> 01:21:41.325
We found it fixin' the plumbin' tonight.

01:21:41.327 --> 01:21:43.796
Is that a fact?

01:21:54.174 --> 01:21:57.241
Son of a bitch! Beat me if you want to!

01:21:57.243 --> 01:22:00.712
Come on! He doesn't
know anything, all right?

01:22:00.714 --> 01:22:04.716
Trouble just seems to follow
you everywhere, doesn't it, C.J.?

01:22:04.718 --> 01:22:09.089
You have really stepped in
a big pile of shit this time.

01:22:11.157 --> 01:22:13.223
How long you been runnin' drugs, Wade?

01:22:13.225 --> 01:22:16.994
Drugs?

01:22:16.996 --> 01:22:20.432
That's old news, friend.

01:22:20.434 --> 01:22:22.667
Show you somethin'.

01:22:22.669 --> 01:22:26.170
Weapons is where the real money's at.

01:22:26.172 --> 01:22:30.411
We goin' straight into Mexico.

01:22:31.678 --> 01:22:34.581
Go fuck yourself.

01:22:38.719 --> 01:22:40.752
Listen.

01:22:40.754 --> 01:22:43.420
I'm gonna ask real nicely...

01:22:43.422 --> 01:22:45.957
one last time.

01:22:47.527 --> 01:22:51.730
Who else knows about the tunnel?

01:22:51.732 --> 01:22:54.766
We got the girl.

01:22:58.904 --> 01:23:01.942
- Ricki.
- Bastard!

01:23:08.081 --> 01:23:10.815
- Stay with them.
- How could you?

01:23:10.817 --> 01:23:13.084
Oh, yeah. You're a tough guy, huh?

01:23:13.086 --> 01:23:14.651
You're a real tough guy.

01:23:14.653 --> 01:23:17.321
Hey.

01:23:17.323 --> 01:23:18.923
What the hell is goin' on?

01:23:18.925 --> 01:23:22.060
Damage control. What the
fuck did it look like?

01:23:22.062 --> 01:23:23.994
We never discussed this!

01:23:23.996 --> 01:23:26.498
What do you think would have
happened when she got to the bar...

01:23:26.500 --> 01:23:28.833
and found that little hole in the basement?

01:23:28.835 --> 01:23:30.634
- What about Brody?
- He wasn't there.

01:23:30.636 --> 01:23:32.904
You let me find him.

01:23:32.906 --> 01:23:35.173
I'm already on it.

01:23:35.175 --> 01:23:38.410
- Gilley!
- You work for me, you understand?

01:23:38.412 --> 01:23:41.315
I call the shots!

01:23:42.515 --> 01:23:45.150
And if I were you, I'd
think long and hard...

01:23:45.152 --> 01:23:49.122
before I opened my mouth again.

01:24:07.139 --> 01:24:09.007
You got work tomorrow?

01:24:09.009 --> 01:24:12.346
Only till closing.

01:24:13.612 --> 01:24:16.148
- I should get goin'.
- Okay.

01:24:18.518 --> 01:24:20.685
Maybe I'll come by and see you.

01:24:20.687 --> 01:24:23.655
I'd like that.

01:24:23.657 --> 01:24:27.459
Maybe I'll even hang
out and help you close.

01:24:27.461 --> 01:24:29.663
Well, I'd like that even more.

01:24:52.685 --> 01:24:54.688
Mom.

01:25:00.861 --> 01:25:03.828
Mom?

01:25:03.830 --> 01:25:07.100
Brody!

01:25:31.056 --> 01:25:33.391
One more move, and I'll
kill her. I swear to God.

01:25:33.393 --> 01:25:36.026
Oh, Brody. Brody.

01:25:36.028 --> 01:25:38.064
Joey, it's okay.

01:25:42.301 --> 01:25:44.067
Oh!

01:25:44.069 --> 01:25:46.036
Oh, Joey. Oh.

01:25:46.038 --> 01:25:48.306
Are you all right?

01:25:48.308 --> 01:25:50.975
Yeah.

01:25:50.977 --> 01:25:53.279
Yeah.

01:26:07.760 --> 01:26:09.826
I know... him.

01:26:09.828 --> 01:26:11.931
He worked for my dad.

01:26:18.804 --> 01:26:20.338
Mom.

01:26:20.340 --> 01:26:23.141
- Brody?
- Call the police.

01:26:23.143 --> 01:26:25.145
Shit.

01:26:31.984 --> 01:26:34.321
Hey! Hey, police!

01:26:37.122 --> 01:26:41.859
What's wrong? What the hell
happened? What the... hell happened?

01:26:41.861 --> 01:26:44.094
He... He was in my car.

01:26:44.096 --> 01:26:49.700
A-And Brody... Brody came.

01:26:49.702 --> 01:26:52.138
Okay. All right.

01:27:05.885 --> 01:27:08.555
- Coffee?
- Thank you.

01:27:09.822 --> 01:27:12.490
I'm gonna need you to go to
the station with Deputy Brooks.

01:27:12.492 --> 01:27:16.227
It's just a formality
with this sort of thing.

01:27:16.229 --> 01:27:19.396
- What about my mom?
- We got an APB out on her.

01:27:19.398 --> 01:27:22.033
That's the best we can do right now.

01:27:22.035 --> 01:27:27.638
Deputy Brooks also said that, uh,
you knew the man that was shot?

01:27:27.640 --> 01:27:30.374
Yeah. He worked for my dad.

01:27:30.376 --> 01:27:32.477
All righty then.

01:27:32.479 --> 01:27:35.213
Well, we're gonna have to check into this.

01:27:35.215 --> 01:27:38.348
In the meantime, I need to get
you back to the ranch and your dad.

01:27:38.350 --> 01:27:41.753
- Does he even know you're here?
- No, sir.

01:27:41.755 --> 01:27:45.088
Well, he's gonna be worried sick.

01:27:45.090 --> 01:27:46.990
I wanna go with Brody.

01:27:46.992 --> 01:27:49.160
No can do. Not unless you're family.

01:27:49.162 --> 01:27:50.727
I'm sorry.

01:27:50.729 --> 01:27:52.996
- I'll see you when I'm done.
- Promise?

01:27:52.998 --> 01:27:54.598
Promise.

01:27:54.600 --> 01:27:57.401
Come on. Right in here.

01:27:57.403 --> 01:28:00.038
Okay. Thanks.

01:28:00.040 --> 01:28:01.772
Sheriff.

01:28:01.774 --> 01:28:04.745
You just hold it right there.

01:28:17.890 --> 01:28:19.356
Joey, don't.

01:28:19.358 --> 01:28:22.528
Joey!

01:28:26.965 --> 01:28:30.368
Come on. Come on now. Let's get you home.

01:28:30.370 --> 01:28:33.206
Come on. Come on, darling.

01:28:47.586 --> 01:28:51.121
Hey. Station's back there.

01:28:51.123 --> 01:28:54.392
We got called out.

01:28:54.394 --> 01:28:56.730
Gonna take but a minute.

01:29:12.912 --> 01:29:15.916
It's Brooks. We're en route.

01:29:28.461 --> 01:29:32.295
Come on out, Sleeping Beauty.

01:29:32.297 --> 01:29:34.999
Get him up.

01:29:35.001 --> 01:29:37.537
Come here, you son of a bitch!

01:29:44.510 --> 01:29:47.145
All right!

01:29:47.147 --> 01:29:50.280
- So it's come down to this?
- Where's Mom?

01:29:50.282 --> 01:29:52.950
She's safe... for now.

01:29:52.952 --> 01:29:55.218
If you hurt her, I swear
to God, I'll kill you.

01:29:58.123 --> 01:29:59.790
I know you're upset, Brody.

01:29:59.792 --> 01:30:04.462
This thing hasn't exactly turned
out how I thought it would either.

01:30:04.464 --> 01:30:06.329
You gotta believe me though.

01:30:06.331 --> 01:30:08.799
This thing is out of my
control. Now fall in line.

01:30:08.801 --> 01:30:10.535
Or what?

01:30:10.537 --> 01:30:14.371
Pretty soon, I'm not
gonna be able to help you,

01:30:14.373 --> 01:30:16.809
even if I want to.

01:30:18.912 --> 01:30:23.380
Oh! Goddamn it!

01:30:23.382 --> 01:30:25.684
Shit!

01:30:27.319 --> 01:30:30.322
Put him in with the others.

01:30:50.742 --> 01:30:52.711
Hey, sweetheart.

01:30:53.912 --> 01:30:56.414
What did you do?

01:30:56.416 --> 01:30:59.386
He was your son.

01:31:04.858 --> 01:31:08.058
What was that all about?

01:31:08.060 --> 01:31:10.063
Ty's dead.

01:31:21.407 --> 01:31:24.277
What do you wanna do?

01:31:29.282 --> 01:31:31.284
Drive.

01:31:52.971 --> 01:31:55.138
- My God. Brody.
- Brody.

01:31:55.140 --> 01:31:58.808
Shit.

01:31:58.810 --> 01:32:02.146
You bastard.

01:32:02.148 --> 01:32:04.147
- You all right?
- I'm fine.

01:32:04.149 --> 01:32:07.319
- You okay?
- I'll live.

01:32:13.292 --> 01:32:16.927
- What's so funny?
- Well, well. Here we are.

01:32:16.929 --> 01:32:22.365
One big, happy, dysfunctional family.

01:32:31.344 --> 01:32:33.513
Hey.

01:32:34.647 --> 01:32:36.649
It's okay.

01:32:39.551 --> 01:32:42.322
It's gonna be all right. Okay?

01:32:43.855 --> 01:32:47.158
I got a knife in this
boot if you can get to it.

01:32:47.160 --> 01:32:49.496
Kick it over.

01:32:53.131 --> 01:32:56.402
Got it. Okay.

01:33:01.506 --> 01:33:03.876
C.J.

01:33:07.313 --> 01:33:09.015
C.J.!

01:33:12.018 --> 01:33:13.517
Hurry.

01:33:13.519 --> 01:33:15.522
Come on.

01:33:25.665 --> 01:33:27.867
C.J., hurry!

01:33:39.178 --> 01:33:41.911
Get up.

01:33:41.913 --> 01:33:43.580
Don't touch her.

01:33:43.582 --> 01:33:46.717
I said, get up!

01:33:46.719 --> 01:33:49.022
Or what?

01:33:53.725 --> 01:33:56.293
What's so funny?

01:34:15.281 --> 01:34:18.315
- They still inside?
- Yeah, Marco and Shane are bringing 'em out.

01:34:18.317 --> 01:34:20.116
Don't bother.

01:34:20.118 --> 01:34:23.253
- What you gonna do?
- Kill 'em all.

01:34:23.255 --> 01:34:24.989
Hey, you sure about this?

01:34:24.991 --> 01:34:27.458
Life's full of tough decisions,
Wade, and one thing's for certain...

01:34:27.460 --> 01:34:29.962
nobody fucks with me.

01:35:00.126 --> 01:35:02.695
- Brody!
- Come on, Mom. Come on. Come on.

01:35:07.200 --> 01:35:09.301
Oh, shit.

01:35:10.702 --> 01:35:13.870
- Damn it!
- Come on, Ray.

01:35:13.872 --> 01:35:15.707
- C.J.
- Brody!

01:35:18.111 --> 01:35:20.013
- Brody!
- Brody!

01:35:23.648 --> 01:35:26.150
Wade. Finish it.

01:35:26.152 --> 01:35:29.189
Damn it, I said finish it.

01:35:33.960 --> 01:35:36.127
No!

01:36:03.656 --> 01:36:07.060
You son of a bitch.

01:36:47.300 --> 01:36:49.936
Joey.

01:36:51.470 --> 01:36:54.405
- Come here.
- Come on. Stay with me.

01:36:54.407 --> 01:36:57.775
Ray. Come on. Stay with me.

01:36:57.777 --> 01:37:02.245
You... You ain't gonna
get rid of me that easy.

01:37:02.247 --> 01:37:04.647
Oh, shit. That hurts.

01:37:04.649 --> 01:37:08.585
Get me to the doctor and
get this damn thing sewed up.

01:37:08.587 --> 01:37:10.420
All right.

01:37:10.422 --> 01:37:12.925
Tough old coot.

01:37:17.630 --> 01:37:19.663
Fifteen minutes till we open.

01:37:19.665 --> 01:37:22.833
What do you boys say to a shot?

01:37:22.835 --> 01:37:24.837
- All right by me.
- Thank you.

01:37:28.608 --> 01:37:31.976
To the fullness of family.

01:37:31.978 --> 01:37:33.980
Cheers.

01:37:36.482 --> 01:37:39.185
Ahh!

01:37:40.353 --> 01:37:43.156
The good stuff.

01:37:50.795 --> 01:37:52.362

01:37:52.364 --> 01:37:54.634
