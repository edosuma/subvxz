{\an3}Hey, Harvey, what are you
doing in the bathroom?

00:35.902 --> 00:37.404
You taking a bath?

00:37.470 --> 00:39.005
{\an1}Whoa.

00:39.072 --> 00:40.340
Oh, hey, guys.

00:40.407 --> 00:42.208
{\an3}I'm just doing
my daily moisturizing.

00:42.275 --> 00:46.646
{\an3}It's important
to keep your skin hydrated.

00:46.713 --> 00:49.516
{\an3}Oh, man. Here, Fee.
I think you need this.

00:49.582 --> 00:52.352
Your skin looks
like a desert.

00:52.419 --> 00:55.588
{\an3}Whoa.
That's cool.

00:55.655 --> 00:57.090
Oh, this scar?

00:57.157 --> 00:58.591
I got it from wrestling
with a giant.

00:58.658 --> 01:00.393
{\an1}All right, dude.
You want to go? You want to go?

01:00.460 --> 01:01.895
{\an1}I don't think
you want to go.

01:01.961 --> 01:02.896
{\an1}Ugh!

01:02.962 --> 01:05.397
[laughs]
It was fun.

01:05.465 --> 01:06.633
I got a scar too.

01:06.699 --> 01:08.968
{\an1}This one's from hugging
a wolverine trap,

01:09.035 --> 01:10.904
{\an1}and this one's
from hugging a wolverine.

01:10.970 --> 01:12.639
- Whoa.
- What about you?

01:12.705 --> 01:15.608
I bet you have some cool stories
about your scars.

01:15.675 --> 01:17.944
Oh, uh, yeah.

01:18.011 --> 01:19.446
{\an3}Sure I do.

01:19.512 --> 01:22.949
{\an3}I've got a birthmark
in the shape of a mermaid.

01:23.016 --> 01:24.717
That's really pretty.

01:24.784 --> 01:25.752
{\an3}No, Harvey.

01:25.819 --> 01:27.387
That's not a real scar.

01:27.454 --> 01:30.323
I bet I have scars
all over the place.

01:32.592 --> 01:35.495
Nope, definitely
no scars there.

01:37.430 --> 01:38.565
Nothing down there either.

01:38.631 --> 01:40.033
{\an3}I hate to break it
to you, buddy.

01:40.099 --> 01:42.001
{\an3}You're smooth
as a newborn baby.

01:42.068 --> 01:44.504
{\an1}Aw, man.
I can't believe this.

01:44.571 --> 01:48.208
{\an1}This needs to be fixed
immediately...

01:48.274 --> 01:50.543
{\an1}right after
I put these back on.

02:00.620 --> 02:03.122
[groaning]

02:03.189 --> 02:05.325
- Dang it!
- What you doing?

02:05.391 --> 02:07.961
{\an1}Gonna give myself
an extreme paper cut

02:08.026 --> 02:09.829
{\an1}so I can have
a scar too.

02:09.895 --> 02:11.331
{\an1}Dang it.

02:11.397 --> 02:13.466
Dude, you're never gonna
get a scar that way,

02:13.533 --> 02:15.435
unless you, like,
pass out from boredom

02:15.502 --> 02:17.203
and hit your head
on a sword or something.

02:17.270 --> 02:18.838
Do you have any swords
around here?

02:18.905 --> 02:20.139
Let me find you a sword.

02:20.206 --> 02:21.774
{\an3}Why do you even
want a scar so bad?

02:21.841 --> 02:25.345
{\an1}I mean, you guys are cool,
and you have a bunch of scars,

02:25.411 --> 02:28.348
and I'm really cool,
and I don't have any.

02:28.414 --> 02:31.050
{\an4}It just seems like
I should catch up, you know?

02:31.117 --> 02:34.521
We are pretty cool.

02:34.587 --> 02:35.588
{\an1}Aah!

02:35.655 --> 02:37.991
{\an1}I can't make myself
hurt myself!

02:38.057 --> 02:39.359
{\an3}Aw, come on,
it's easy. Watch.

02:39.425 --> 02:42.228
{\an3}Ow. Ow.
Ouch. Ugh. Ow.

02:45.265 --> 02:47.267
[sighs]
This is hard.

02:47.333 --> 02:48.968
{\an1}All right,
I can't do this,

02:49.035 --> 02:51.137
{\an1}but you're weirdly talented
at it.

02:51.204 --> 02:52.805
{\an1}So here's
what's gonna happen--

02:52.872 --> 02:54.374
{\an1}you're gonna
give me a scar.

02:54.440 --> 02:55.942
That sounds super fun,

02:56.009 --> 02:58.778
{\an3}but I don't think
you really want a scar.

02:58.845 --> 03:00.280
Scars are forever, man.

03:00.346 --> 03:02.916
I do want one, super bad!

03:02.982 --> 03:05.518
You have to promise
to give me a scar.

03:05.585 --> 03:07.854
(both)
Okay. We promise.

03:07.921 --> 03:09.255
No, I'm serious.

03:09.322 --> 03:11.925
You have to swear
to give me a scar.

03:11.991 --> 03:14.193
(both)
Okay. We swear.

03:14.260 --> 03:16.095
You have to...

03:16.162 --> 03:17.864
pinkie swear.

03:17.931 --> 03:19.065
[both gasping]

03:19.132 --> 03:20.767
Pinkie swear.

03:20.833 --> 03:23.436
Even if later,
I tell you to stop,

03:23.503 --> 03:25.605
you can't go back
on your pinkie swear.

03:25.672 --> 03:30.610
The pinkie swear is,
as you know, unbreakable.

03:30.677 --> 03:31.844
{\an3}Very well.

03:31.911 --> 03:35.214
(both)
We pinkie swear.

03:35.281 --> 03:37.050
Sweet.
Will it hurt a lot?

03:37.116 --> 03:39.686
Nah. The worst part
is the anticipation.

03:39.752 --> 03:41.788
{\an3}But you won't have
to worry about that,

03:41.854 --> 03:45.191
{\an3}because you'll never see
it coming.

03:45.258 --> 03:47.493
Okay, sounds good.
See you guys later.

03:50.396 --> 03:51.831
I'm gonna get some juice.

03:51.898 --> 03:54.367
Cool guys get scars and juice.

03:54.434 --> 03:56.202
Whoa!
What was that?

03:56.269 --> 03:57.370
Quit walking so weird.

03:57.437 --> 03:59.872
{\an1}You're making it hard
to hit you.

03:59.939 --> 04:01.741
{\an3}[laughs]
O-okay, cool.

04:01.808 --> 04:03.042
But, you know what?

04:03.109 --> 04:06.112
{\an3}I think I'm gonna go put
on my bike helmet.

04:06.179 --> 04:09.949
I mean, I'm trying to get
a scar, not a concussion, right?

04:10.016 --> 04:11.150
[laughs]

04:12.585 --> 04:14.253
- Wow!
- Dang it.

04:14.320 --> 04:18.190
O-okay, I'm just gonna put
on my dad's safety goggles.

04:18.257 --> 04:20.593
I mean, nobody wants scars
on their eyes.

04:20.660 --> 04:22.028
Whoa!

04:22.095 --> 04:26.165
Okay, well, maybe
let's just protect my hands.

04:27.500 --> 04:29.002

- Ah!
- What the heck, man?

04:42.281 --> 04:44.217
{\an3}Do you want a scar,
or don't you?

04:44.283 --> 04:45.585
Uh...

04:45.652 --> 04:49.255
I do?

04:50.189 --> 04:52.258
Ugh.

04:54.193 --> 04:55.528
I know they're out there,

04:55.595 --> 04:59.165
but why aren't they coming
for me?

on the scar thing, okay?

[knock at door]

05:15.782 --> 05:17.216
Hey, pal.
I brought you some--

05:17.283 --> 05:18.718
Aah!

05:18.785 --> 05:21.487
[laughter]

05:21.554 --> 05:23.723
They were outside
this whole time?

05:23.790 --> 05:27.326
{\an1}Okay, this pinkie swear
is turning into a stinky swear.

05:27.393 --> 05:30.730
Got to find a way
to get out of it.

05:34.200 --> 05:35.468
Hey, guys, great news--

05:35.535 --> 05:38.004
you don't have
to attack me anymore.

05:38.071 --> 05:39.906
{\an1}(Harvey)
Kratz? Claire?

05:39.972 --> 05:41.808
Sorry, Harvey.

05:41.874 --> 05:43.443
- Yah!
- Whoa!

05:43.509 --> 05:45.578
All right, buddy,
let's get you a scar.

05:45.645 --> 05:47.413
{\an3}No, no, no!
You don't have to!

05:47.480 --> 05:49.182
Look, I already got one.

05:49.248 --> 05:51.084
{\an3}See?
Super-cool scar.

05:51.150 --> 05:52.952
Ooh, that is a good one.

05:53.019 --> 05:55.388
I guess we don't have
to throw you in there.

05:58.091 --> 06:00.259
[buzzing loudly]

06:00.326 --> 06:01.394
[splats]

06:01.461 --> 06:03.996
- What is that?
- I don't know.

06:04.063 --> 06:07.100
{\an3}Pretty sure it would've given
you a scar somehow, though.

06:07.166 --> 06:08.634
So, how'd you do it?

06:08.701 --> 06:10.603
{\an3}Yeah, did you find
a sword?

06:10.670 --> 06:12.605
Yes.
I took your advice.

06:12.672 --> 06:14.574
I got really bored
and fell asleep,

06:14.640 --> 06:17.243
and my head landed a sword.

06:17.310 --> 06:18.377
Wait a minute.

06:18.444 --> 06:20.313
How did the scar
heal so quickly?

06:20.379 --> 06:21.948
Well, uh...

06:22.014 --> 06:23.349
The sword was really hot

06:23.416 --> 06:25.718
because I left it out
in the sun

06:25.785 --> 06:30.289
and it, like, "clotterized"
the wound right away.

06:33.292 --> 06:34.627
It's a fake.

06:34.694 --> 06:37.029
Aah!

06:37.096 --> 06:38.798
Mmm, fruit snack.

06:41.200 --> 06:43.603
Harvey, come out
and play with us!

06:43.669 --> 06:46.372
All right, you guys,
Harvey's not coming out.

06:46.439 --> 06:48.374
He wants to see you inside,

06:48.441 --> 06:50.243
and make sure
you don't bring any harm--

06:50.309 --> 06:53.646
{\an3}Aah!

06:53.713 --> 06:55.715
{\an1}Aw, man.
It's just you.

06:55.782 --> 06:58.451
Like I said,
Harvey wants to meet with you,

06:58.518 --> 07:00.386
and I'll act as moderator.

07:00.453 --> 07:02.955
{\an1}It's okay to come out.
They're unarmed.

07:08.427 --> 07:10.563
Uh, what are you wearing?

07:10.630 --> 07:12.131
It looks ridiculous.

07:12.198 --> 07:15.134
{\an1}How dare you question
Harvey's fashion choices?

07:15.201 --> 07:17.870
{\an6}It's okay, Dade. It's just
a little extra padding.

07:17.937 --> 07:20.239
{\an3}But how are we supposed
to give you a scar

07:20.306 --> 07:22.241
with all that on?

07:22.308 --> 07:23.910
That's what...

07:23.976 --> 07:25.878
That's what I wanted to talk
to you about.

07:25.945 --> 07:29.816
You see, I don't really need
a scar to have an adventure.

07:29.882 --> 07:31.584
I have adventures
all the time.

07:31.651 --> 07:33.653
This whole day's been
an adventure.

07:33.719 --> 07:36.556
It's not the scars
that make the experience.

07:36.622 --> 07:40.293
It's the experience
that makes the scars...

07:40.359 --> 07:41.494
but not.

07:41.561 --> 07:45.164
And with that,
I rest my case.

07:45.231 --> 07:46.566
Dade?

07:46.632 --> 07:48.768
{\an1}I don't know what he said,
but I agree.

07:48.835 --> 07:52.805
{\an3}So you want us to stop
trying to give you a scar?

07:52.872 --> 07:54.106
That's pretty much it.

07:54.173 --> 07:55.441
Are you sure?

07:55.508 --> 07:57.043
{\an3}Definitely.
No scars.

07:57.109 --> 07:59.345
{\an3}Okay, I guess
we'll leave you alone now.

07:59.412 --> 08:00.780
Bye, Harvey.

08:00.847 --> 08:02.982
Wow.
Thanks for understanding.

08:03.049 --> 08:05.518
{\an3}I can finally
take this stuff off.

08:05.585 --> 08:06.853
Oh, here, let me help.

08:06.919 --> 08:08.888
{\an6}(Fee)
We promised to give you a scar!

08:08.955 --> 08:11.324
I know this is all part
of your plan!

08:11.390 --> 08:14.327
Why is this happening?

08:14.393 --> 08:16.162
(Fee)
Hold still, Harvey.

08:16.229 --> 08:17.163
Aah!

08:23.636 --> 08:25.171
Get back here, Harvey!

08:25.238 --> 08:26.873
{\an1}(Foo)
We pinkie swore!

08:29.575 --> 08:31.944
[both grunting in pain]

08:41.087 --> 08:43.054
End of the line.

08:43.121 --> 08:45.057
Whoa!

08:49.262 --> 08:53.032
{\an1}Hey, this is the thing
we were gonna throw Harvey in.

08:53.099 --> 08:54.634
Be careful, guys!

08:54.700 --> 08:57.136
- That plant looks dangerous.
- No big deal.

08:57.203 --> 08:59.538
{\an1}Just got to climb
up the tree.

08:59.605 --> 09:00.606
[grunting]

09:00.673 --> 09:02.909
- Ooh, a bug.
- Foo, no!

09:02.975 --> 09:06.212
Bug! Ooh. Bug!

09:06.279 --> 09:08.481
(both)
Aah!

09:08.547 --> 09:12.451
[gasps]
No!

09:12.518 --> 09:15.655
[all grunting]

09:16.789 --> 09:19.125
Harvey, you saved us.

09:19.191 --> 09:21.494
Does it hurt?

09:21.560 --> 09:22.995
I think I'm okay.

09:23.062 --> 09:24.196
Are you guys all right?

09:24.263 --> 09:25.831
I didn't get that bug.

09:25.898 --> 09:30.536
Come on, let's get
out of this thing.

09:30.603 --> 09:31.671
Let's go, Harvey.

09:31.737 --> 09:34.206
Hold on.
This is tricky.

09:34.273 --> 09:35.408
All right...

09:35.474 --> 09:36.609
careful.

09:36.676 --> 09:37.877
Gently...

09:37.944 --> 09:39.412
Almost...

09:39.478 --> 09:40.613
It's clogged?

09:40.680 --> 09:43.416
{\an3}Eric, how many times
have I told you

09:43.482 --> 09:45.685
{\an3}not to put your pillows
in here?

09:45.751 --> 09:47.787
It's so dangerous.

09:47.853 --> 09:50.456
Oh, yes, there we go.

09:50.523 --> 09:52.224
{\an1}(Harvey)
Aah!

09:52.291 --> 09:53.459
Oh, no!

09:53.526 --> 09:55.895
He was so brave.

09:55.962 --> 09:58.998
He sacrificed himself
so we could get out.

Aah!

20:21.920 --> 20:23.789
{\an3}Halbreth, the trees
are gonna hit my house,

20:23.855 --> 20:25.657
{\an3}and all my family
and things are in there!

20:25.724 --> 20:29.394
{\an3}And I-I-I don't know
what I'm doing.

20:29.461 --> 20:30.829
All right, nose plug.

20:30.896 --> 20:32.431
I think I can help you.

20:32.497 --> 20:35.000
{\an1}But you got to get me as close
to your house as you can,

20:35.067 --> 20:36.435
{\an1}and fast.

20:40.272 --> 20:42.774
Hey, kid, look out!

20:51.650 --> 20:53.485
{\an3}There's no time
to find a way around.

20:53.552 --> 20:55.354
You got to run through them.

20:55.420 --> 20:59.324
All right, let's do this.

20:59.391 --> 21:01.159
[grunting]

21:01.226 --> 21:03.261
Ow. Man, that hurts.

21:03.328 --> 21:06.732
Please, Halbreth,
save my house!

21:10.335 --> 21:12.971
Hurry!

21:13.038 --> 21:15.407
Wha--

21:19.911 --> 21:22.280
{\an1}[moaning]

21:22.347 --> 21:23.415
{\an1}Ugh.

21:23.482 --> 21:24.549
Thank you, Mr. Halbreth.

21:24.616 --> 21:26.551
{\an1}I'm sorry
I stole your machine.

21:26.618 --> 21:29.488
I made such a mess
out of everything.

21:29.554 --> 21:32.090
{\an3}Yeah, well,
you are pretty dumb,

21:32.157 --> 21:35.994
{\an3}but I know how you
can make it up to me.

21:36.061 --> 21:39.564
[both grunting]

21:41.366 --> 21:42.801
- How was that?
- Perfect.

21:42.868 --> 21:45.504
Hey, let's see some hustle
there, melon head.

21:45.570 --> 21:49.441
{\an1}Yes, sir.
I got this.

21:49.508 --> 21:53.478
{\an1}Phew, maybe I got
a little too crazy there.

21:53.545 --> 21:56.348
{\an3}I'll just set the rest
of these down.
