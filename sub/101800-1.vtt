WEBVTT

03:07.654 --> 03:09.790
Hollywood is a cesspool.

03:13.060 --> 03:14.729
God I hate my life.

03:15.528 --> 03:19.066
Everyone sucks, I don't even
wanna get up.

03:23.237 --> 03:25.039
Hey Breen it's
Hampton,

03:25.072 --> 03:27.507
hope you're not still sleeping.

03:27.540 --> 03:29.911
Huckle is as usual, is
not responding to me

03:29.944 --> 03:32.046
and we need him to respond.

03:32.079 --> 03:34.148
We have Pish tomorrow, big
meeting for "Beast Moon."

03:36.884 --> 03:40.054
Beez, he's not staring at
you, he's staring at everybody.

03:40.087 --> 03:41.088
Come on.

03:45.525 --> 03:47.627
You fucking wanker.

03:47.661 --> 03:49.964
This is how you lost more
money on "Gods of Pluto"

03:49.997 --> 03:51.665
than any film in history.

03:51.698 --> 03:52.532
Losing track of your star.

03:52.565 --> 03:55.635
Look, I didn't lose Huckle,
Scram.

03:55.669 --> 03:57.939
Then where is he?

03:57.972 --> 04:00.107
How the hell did you convince
Ali Goldberg

04:00.141 --> 04:03.476
in to giving you 300
million dollars, Breen, hey?

04:03.510 --> 04:06.047
Because I'm awesome and a god.

04:06.914 --> 04:10.617
Yeah, well I'm your
god now motherfucker.

04:10.650 --> 04:11.651
And in case you didn't hear,

04:11.685 --> 04:13.620
being on the bottom rung
of the industry ladder,

04:13.653 --> 04:17.191
Goldberg's running the studio
now and she fucking hates ya.

04:17.224 --> 04:20.962
So I suggest you get your
drug-addled, sex-crazed,

04:20.995 --> 04:23.530
motherfucking client to
that meeting tomorrow!

04:23.563 --> 04:27.735
Look, don't worry, we're
gonna be there at 9 a.m, okay?

04:27.768 --> 04:29.870
And "Beast Moon" is an awesome
project,

04:29.904 --> 04:31.806
that's why you believe in it.

04:34.041 --> 04:36.509
I believe in Huckle Saxton you
moron.

04:36.543 --> 04:38.611
He's selling like used
panties in Hong Kong.

04:38.645 --> 04:40.781
Look, it's not all
about the money, right?

04:41.849 --> 04:44.919
Breen, you're a cocksucker.

04:44.952 --> 04:47.687
Do not let Huckle be late
for that meeting with Pish.

04:47.722 --> 04:50.690
We will be there at 9 a.m.
sharp.

04:50.725 --> 04:53.828
Yeah and you'd better pray
to the gods of Pluto he is.

04:53.861 --> 04:56.998
You do not want to get on my bad
side.

04:59.100 --> 05:00.935
I'm not on your bad side?

05:00.968 --> 05:02.036
You fucker.

05:05.572 --> 05:07.808
Executive producers.

05:08.976 --> 05:10.311
Huckle's gonna blow this
one for you too, isn't he?

05:10.344 --> 05:12.980
Well if you keep thinking
negatively.

05:13.014 --> 05:14.949
Look, I need you to go
feed Beez for me all right,

05:14.982 --> 05:16.217
I gotta find Huck.

05:16.250 --> 05:18.651
Wait, don't you have a date
with Kira?

05:18.685 --> 05:21.756
Yeah, it's our two month
anniversary.

05:21.789 --> 05:22.790
Aww.

05:23.424 --> 05:25.692
Good morning
Hollyweird, Jade Blaze here,

05:25.726 --> 05:27.795
welcome to a quick ZMT FLash.

05:27.828 --> 05:29.997
Our current favorite
bad boy Huckle Saxton,

05:30.031 --> 05:31.232
always up to no good,

05:31.265 --> 05:32.166
is it seems after punching out

05:32.199 --> 05:34.201
the craft department head on
"Beast Moon"

05:34.235 --> 05:36.971
the production has been
officially shut down once again

05:37.004 --> 05:39.273
due to Huckle refusing to
come out of his trailer

05:39.306 --> 05:40.408
for seven days,

05:40.441 --> 05:43.277
costing the production millions
in overhead lost funds,

05:43.310 --> 05:45.813
which makes the reckless
studio producer Breen Nash

05:45.846 --> 05:48.149
look like the captain of
the Titanic right now.

05:48.182 --> 05:50.718
"Gods of Pluto" being the worst
film of all time of course

05:50.751 --> 05:52.787
doesn't make Huckle the
most bankable at the moment

05:52.820 --> 05:53.854
but he feels like "Beast Moon"

05:53.888 --> 05:56.257
can get him back to number
one on the star-o-meter.

05:56.290 --> 05:58.591
He better have a smash on his
hands.

05:58.625 --> 06:00.227
Our beloved boss man, Finnegan
Mutto,

06:00.261 --> 06:02.730
saw a test screening of
Huckle's newest TV pilot,

06:02.763 --> 06:05.166
"Vampire Knights" and
called Huckle's acting,

06:05.199 --> 06:09.203
"The worst performance of
anything I have ever seen."

06:09.236 --> 06:12.273
More like
#hucklesuxton.

06:12.306 --> 06:14.208
In a fit of rage,
Huckle visited Finnegan

06:14.241 --> 06:16.844
outside the ZMT office
and stomped his legs

06:16.877 --> 06:19.046
until his testicles were
smashed.

06:21.916 --> 06:24.684
He was in a full testicle cast
for months.

06:24.718 --> 06:27.254
We're pulling for your
Finny, you'll walk again.

06:27.288 --> 06:30.925
Signing off, this is Jade
Blaze with ZMT Flash.

06:30.958 --> 06:33.060
Son of a bitch!

06:33.094 --> 06:34.829
These idiots don't
understand what it's like

06:34.862 --> 06:36.330
to lose everything.

06:39.233 --> 06:41.402
I need a vengeful man.

06:41.435 --> 06:44.171
I want Huckle's dick in my hand.

06:47.908 --> 06:50.111
I want his legs broken.

06:50.144 --> 06:52.780
His body burned in public

06:52.813 --> 06:57.184
and I want you and the
rest of the idiots I hire

06:57.218 --> 06:59.120
to find him before tonight's
show.

07:09.363 --> 07:11.698
Hey, no I'm at the club.

07:13.100 --> 07:16.170
I gotta find Huck,
okay, just keep calling.

07:16.203 --> 07:20.207
Oh wait, wait, wait,
wait, has Kira called?

07:20.241 --> 07:24.812
I've called her a million
times, she's not calling.

07:24.845 --> 07:25.913
Wow.

07:29.884 --> 07:30.885
Kira!

07:31.919 --> 07:33.020
Fuck me sideways.

07:33.053 --> 07:34.687
What are you doing?

07:34.722 --> 07:36.457
I've called you like a thousand
times.

07:36.490 --> 07:38.759
Oh, I lost my phone.

07:38.792 --> 07:40.361
Well what's that right there?

07:40.394 --> 07:42.997
Oh, you found it, thank you.

07:45.266 --> 07:47.368
What the fuck do you want
Breen?

07:47.401 --> 07:48.302
Oh, I wanna know

07:48.335 --> 07:50.171
if you're gonna make the meeting
tomorrow.

07:50.204 --> 07:53.073
What's the meeting about, your
dick?

07:53.107 --> 07:54.241
Gonna be a short one.

07:54.275 --> 07:57.144
And he's only got
one nut.

07:57.178 --> 07:58.746
He looks like a Ken doll down
there.

07:58.779 --> 08:00.915
That is not true, I have two
nuts.

08:00.948 --> 08:02.283
Remind you of anything She-ra?

08:02.316 --> 08:03.450
Her name's Kira.

08:03.484 --> 08:04.318
A lot longer.

08:04.351 --> 08:05.386
Okay really?

08:05.419 --> 08:06.854
We're going home aren't we dear?

08:06.887 --> 08:08.088
No we're not.

08:17.431 --> 08:19.867
That's disgusting.

08:21.969 --> 08:23.003
Just be at that meeting
tomorrow.

08:23.037 --> 08:25.039
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
9 a.m, I'll be there.

08:25.072 --> 08:29.743
Can you leave me alone while
your girl sucks my finger?

08:32.780 --> 08:35.449
You be home by midnight young
lady.

08:37.451 --> 08:38.986
Bye Breen!

08:39.019 --> 08:42.957
Well, well, well, if
it isn't Breen Nash.

08:42.990 --> 08:44.925
Not tonight Finnegan.

08:45.626 --> 08:48.128
Hey, let's ask the Hollywood
dinosaur

08:48.162 --> 08:52.199
why homeland security has put
him on the top of their list?

08:52.233 --> 08:55.035
Putting bombs in theaters since
1993.

08:55.069 --> 08:57.071
Very funny, thank you.

08:58.372 --> 09:00.441
But I'm sure he's got a client
in there?

09:00.474 --> 09:01.775
Who's just waiting for me

09:01.809 --> 09:04.878
to take all types of juicy pics,
hey?

09:04.912 --> 09:09.383
Maybe I'll wait 'til he gets
too drunk to recognize me.

09:10.317 --> 09:12.453
Maybe I'll sleep with him.

09:16.423 --> 09:19.860
You take advantage of him one
more time

09:19.893 --> 09:22.563
and I will smash your legs
myself.

09:22.596 --> 09:25.232
I'm gonna destroy him Breen.

09:25.266 --> 09:26.800
And you along with him
if you're not careful.

09:26.834 --> 09:29.303
Just leave us alone, okay?

09:29.336 --> 09:30.471
I mean we got a meeting
tomorrow,

09:30.504 --> 09:32.339
there's nothing to see here
anyway.

09:32.373 --> 09:33.841
Oh yeah, whoa!

09:35.075 --> 09:36.076
You and you.

09:37.177 --> 09:38.178
Yes!

09:39.046 --> 09:40.080
Oh yeah!

09:40.114 --> 09:44.518
Nothing to see,
toodles.

09:46.186 --> 09:48.322
I got a story to crack boss.

09:48.355 --> 09:50.024
Go away Finnegan.

10:11.645 --> 10:13.447
God I hate my life.

10:20.087 --> 10:23.257
Why can't I make a movie
that people like Beez?

10:23.290 --> 10:25.959
I mean is that too much to ask?

11:45.439 --> 11:47.107
Hey Huck, hi buddy.

11:47.876 --> 11:49.977
I know I've called you a few
times,

11:50.010 --> 11:51.979
like seven times now,

11:52.012 --> 11:55.717
but we have 9 o' clock
meeting, right, remember?

11:55.750 --> 11:58.118
I hope you're here soon.

12:02.322 --> 12:04.024
Right behind you asshole.

12:04.057 --> 12:07.060
He's at the bar, I know
he's at the bar right now.

12:07.094 --> 12:07.896
He's at the bar right?

12:07.928 --> 12:10.330
And oh my god, I gotta go get
him.

12:11.331 --> 12:13.467
I gotta go get him.

13:08.121 --> 13:09.256
Where are you?

13:09.289 --> 13:10.792
Pish is gonna be here any
minute.

13:10.825 --> 13:12.693
Listen to me, I need
you to go to the kitchen

13:12.727 --> 13:14.628
and grab me three cups of coffee
quickly,

13:14.661 --> 13:18.065
meet me out front where my car
is, okay?

13:18.098 --> 13:18.733
And I will come...

13:18.766 --> 13:19.600
What are you doing?

13:19.633 --> 13:20.634
Hey, hey!

13:22.069 --> 13:24.538
Oh my God, is he okay?

13:24.571 --> 13:25.539
Why do you ask, I mean,

13:25.572 --> 13:26.673
it's not like I hit him
with my car or anything.

13:26.708 --> 13:28.542
I mean it's not like we
have an important meeting

13:28.575 --> 13:29.811
or anything right now.

13:29.844 --> 13:30.677
He's drunk!

13:30.712 --> 13:31.378
Yes.

13:31.411 --> 13:33.080
Great, I mean what an asshole.

13:33.113 --> 13:35.616
He knows how important
this meeting is right now.

13:35.649 --> 13:38.452
Hello, wake up, come on, wake
up.

13:39.520 --> 13:41.255
Breen he's ice cold.

13:43.190 --> 13:45.225
Hence the coffee.

13:55.469 --> 13:57.839
Open up, it's the police!

13:57.872 --> 14:00.440
Pish.

14:02.376 --> 14:03.210
I got ya!

14:03.243 --> 14:05.445
You did, you got me.

14:05.479 --> 14:07.481
You looked frightened.

14:11.552 --> 14:13.687
So Pish, how's the wife?

14:16.156 --> 14:17.157
She died.

14:18.692 --> 14:20.160
Oh, I'm sorry.

14:22.864 --> 14:25.098
How is your son?

14:25.132 --> 14:28.468
He dead too, same time, double
funeral.

14:30.805 --> 14:32.072
What's wrong?

14:33.340 --> 14:34.241
Wrong?

14:34.274 --> 14:35.743
No, not you, him.

14:36.410 --> 14:39.613
Why he smile, when I say son
dead?

14:39.646 --> 14:43.417
Look, look, look, look,
he's still smiling.

14:43.450 --> 14:46.520
He's happy to be doing "Beast
Moon"

14:49.222 --> 14:51.826
which, let's get down to it
Pish,

14:53.460 --> 14:55.662
are you ready to cashflow this
thing

14:55.696 --> 14:59.132
and get into the Huckle Saxton
business?

15:03.437 --> 15:05.639
Why I see blood on shirt?

15:09.509 --> 15:12.714
Did he whammy the lady I saw
last time?

15:15.349 --> 15:16.751
"I'm an old lady."

15:22.322 --> 15:24.926
No, that is actually fake
blood,

15:24.959 --> 15:27.594
that we were doing a make up
test.

15:27.628 --> 15:29.529
Just part of the process, you
know,

15:29.563 --> 15:30.664
prepping for the film.

15:30.697 --> 15:33.901
Ah, I special effects make-up?

15:33.935 --> 15:35.469
- I like that, I like that.
- Exactly.

15:35.502 --> 15:37.437
I have to be honest with you
Pish,

15:37.471 --> 15:38.438
Huck is...

15:43.677 --> 15:46.346
He partied hard last night.

15:46.380 --> 15:49.516
I mean, he's really happy
to be doing this picture

15:49.549 --> 15:53.153
but he's a little out of it at
the moment.

15:55.422 --> 15:57.892
He is going to be in picture?

15:57.925 --> 15:58.926
100%.

16:05.298 --> 16:09.670
Call the police, I think
he murdered the movie star.

16:13.007 --> 16:16.443
I'm sorry, what did you say?

16:16.476 --> 16:20.247
I said my daughter would
like an autograph from Huckle.

16:20.280 --> 16:21.682
You got a problem?

16:24.719 --> 16:27.789
No, no, I'm just happy she's
alive.

16:39.033 --> 16:40.768
Here's your check.

16:43.004 --> 16:45.405
Next meeting better be
different.

16:45.439 --> 16:47.307
You gotta do something, you
know,

16:47.340 --> 16:52.345
you can't have a hit picture
with him looking like that.

16:52.379 --> 16:57.284
And if it's not a hit, my friend
will do something for you.

17:01.756 --> 17:02.724
And for fuck's sake,

17:02.757 --> 17:05.927
make a better picture
than "Gods of Pluto,"

17:05.960 --> 17:10.965
that's a bunch of.

17:15.036 --> 17:16.570
Thank you Pish.

17:22.009 --> 17:25.947
Looks like you nailed it
slugger, you got the money!

17:25.980 --> 17:28.015
How are you not excited right
now?

17:28.049 --> 17:29.382
Huck's dead.

17:32.586 --> 17:35.589
Sweetie, every career
has its peaks and valleys.

17:35.622 --> 17:37.557
No, he's really dead.

17:40.728 --> 17:43.663
I don't know what happened,
I just went to pick him up

17:43.697 --> 17:46.566
and I didn't , backed up,.

17:46.600 --> 17:47.434
Oh my god.

17:47.467 --> 17:48.468
Oh my...

17:48.502 --> 17:49.837
Come on, come on,
let's go to the bathroom.

17:49.871 --> 17:53.273
- Go to the bathroom.
- I'm gonna be sick.

17:55.710 --> 17:57.644
Who the fuck is this?

17:59.947 --> 18:04.484
Fucking hell, fucking asshole,
no money too probably.

18:06.053 --> 18:07.955
Fuck.

18:12.559 --> 18:13.393
Yeah.

18:13.426 --> 18:14.594
Yeah, got your page.

18:14.628 --> 18:16.363
Chrome here, speak.

18:16.396 --> 18:18.365
Chrome Mangle from Mangle
and Mangle Investigations?

18:18.398 --> 18:20.534
It's just Mangle now, who is
this?

18:20.567 --> 18:22.970
It's me mate, Finny.

18:23.004 --> 18:25.907
Finnegan, don't tell
me I owe you money too.

18:25.940 --> 18:30.477
No, old friend, I wanna
hire you for a skip trace.

18:30.510 --> 18:32.379
I don't do that shit anymore,
you know,

18:32.412 --> 18:34.614
since my, since my brother.

18:35.448 --> 18:40.654
What if I was to tell you
that I've stumbled across a file

18:41.122 --> 18:42.957
that could lead you to
your brother's killer?

18:42.990 --> 18:45.793
Cut it with the sausage
Finnegan, I ain't biting.

18:45.827 --> 18:48.996
Come on down to the office,
we'll discuss it over a drink,

18:49.030 --> 18:50.198
for old time's sake.

18:50.231 --> 18:52.632
I've had more fun with a
couple of doorknobs, goodbye.

18:52.666 --> 18:56.336
So dismount and grease
'em up on my dime.

18:58.773 --> 18:59.907
All right, I'll tell you what,

18:59.941 --> 19:03.677
have a nice fifth waiting
for me and my usual 12 pack.

19:03.711 --> 19:04.511
Of course.

19:04.544 --> 19:07.081
And a nice box of
wine.

19:07.114 --> 19:07.949
Yes.

19:07.982 --> 19:09.482
The clear kind.

19:09.516 --> 19:10.684
White?

19:10.718 --> 19:13.120
Yeah, pinot, that's it,
that pinot grego, that's shit.

19:13.154 --> 19:14.822
Oh and Finnegan?

19:14.856 --> 19:16.090
Yes.

19:16.123 --> 19:18.793
I've built up quite a thirst.

19:25.498 --> 19:26.133
Yes!

19:31.571 --> 19:33.808
Hey Huckle, what's up brother?

19:33.841 --> 19:35.977
Made the trades again.

19:36.010 --> 19:38.145
Well your ass did.

19:38.179 --> 19:41.414
Jeez man, what did you
get into last night?

19:41.448 --> 19:43.885
What are you doing man,
what are you tokin'?

19:43.918 --> 19:45.452
Come on, I know you did
something man,

19:45.485 --> 19:47.755
were you eatin' or cheatin' man?

19:47.788 --> 19:51.726
Were you poppin', droppin',
were you shootin', tootin'?

19:51.759 --> 19:54.427
Smokin, tokin', come on talk to
me Huckle.

19:54.461 --> 19:56.097
Hello, what were you gettin'
into?

19:56.130 --> 19:58.933
TCB, THC, LSD, PCP, DMT,
ecstasy?

20:04.537 --> 20:05.538
The?

20:08.042 --> 20:09.844
Holy shit is he dead?

20:12.880 --> 20:14.614
I'm going to jail.

20:16.117 --> 20:17.985
No one is going to
jail.

20:18.019 --> 20:19.053
What are we gonna do?

20:19.086 --> 20:23.824
Guys, the worst human
being in the world is dead

20:23.858 --> 20:26.227
and we have 10 million dollars.

20:26.260 --> 20:27.328
I'm just a filmmaker

20:27.361 --> 20:30.831
but I'm pretty sure without
the star we're screwed.

20:30.865 --> 20:32.199
So we use a double.

20:32.233 --> 20:33.935
Yeah, I mean we get a
doppelganger.

20:33.968 --> 20:34.634
What?

20:34.668 --> 20:36.771
Hell, Cuba had three Castros.

20:36.804 --> 20:37.872
Is that true?

20:37.905 --> 20:39.673
Guys, he's married,

20:39.707 --> 20:42.143
I'm pretty sure his
wife will figure it out.

20:42.176 --> 20:44.211
Oh god, this is the second worst
thing

20:44.245 --> 20:46.147
that's ever happened to me.

20:46.180 --> 20:49.984
Breen, it's okay,
we'll think of something.

20:54.021 --> 20:57.490
I think I know somebody
that can help us.

21:01.528 --> 21:03.230
Aren't you worried about the
ethical lines

21:03.264 --> 21:04.432
we're crossing here?

21:04.464 --> 21:08.601
I'm a producer now Hampton,
I worry about everything.

21:08.635 --> 21:09.569
Well I guess we're talking

21:09.602 --> 21:13.174
full producer credit
for me too now, right?

21:13.207 --> 21:16.711
Co-pro, come on, I am covering
up a murder you know Muff?

21:16.744 --> 21:19.013
Yeah, not very well if
you keep mentioning it.

21:19.046 --> 21:20.948
Just shut up and try to act
normal.

21:20.982 --> 21:24.251
Okay, just let me do the
talking, right?

21:25.152 --> 21:27.021
Stop, stop pushing me.

21:28.990 --> 21:29.957
Hello good sir,

21:29.991 --> 21:32.793
we are here looking for
an employee of yours,

21:32.827 --> 21:35.495
dark eyes, dark hair, ponytail?

21:41.102 --> 21:43.771
Gotcha, well he had Lunchables.

21:45.106 --> 21:48.109
If he was here and he did work
here,

21:49.609 --> 21:51.544
maybe he's in the back?

21:54.115 --> 21:58.986
Affirmative, let's go look
for him, that way please.

21:59.020 --> 22:00.021
Not bad.

22:05.092 --> 22:08.863
Oh hey, he slimed
me.

22:08.896 --> 22:11.032
Oh my god, I'm so sorry.

22:12.133 --> 22:17.204
Wait, can you take off your
glasses and that hood thing?

22:18.906 --> 22:19.907
Sure.

22:29.649 --> 22:30.650
Holy shit.

22:32.186 --> 22:33.620
What?

22:33.653 --> 22:34.587
How would you like to be a
rich

22:34.621 --> 22:36.991
and famous actor for
the rest of your life?

22:37.024 --> 22:38.259
What do I have to do?

22:40.161 --> 22:41.896
Ready to be a movie star?

22:41.929 --> 22:43.764
Am I gonna be in an actual
movie?

22:43.798 --> 22:47.802
Yes but not you, okay,
let's get you up, okay.

22:49.837 --> 22:50.838
Okay, okay.

22:52.073 --> 22:53.174
You're going to be playing

22:53.207 --> 22:56.877
the role of the famous
Hollywood actor Huckle Saxton.

22:56.911 --> 22:59.146
Huckle Sax, Huckle Saxton?

22:59.180 --> 23:01.382
I love Huckle, I saw "Gods of
Pluto"

23:01.415 --> 23:02.817
in the theater eight times.

23:02.850 --> 23:03.918
Oh perfect.

23:05.920 --> 23:07.121
Is Muff here?

23:07.822 --> 23:11.192
No, what's the emergency
darling?

23:11.225 --> 23:13.961
That's kinda a long story
but I need a little favor.

23:13.994 --> 23:15.662
Of course you do.

23:15.695 --> 23:17.998
Hey, thank god.

23:18.032 --> 23:19.400
Hi, I'm...

23:19.433 --> 23:23.370
Huckle Saxton, we know
who you are knucklehead.

23:23.404 --> 23:25.339
Mighty Huckle Saxton.

23:26.040 --> 23:28.909
Sugarplum, can I steal you for
a sec?

23:28.943 --> 23:30.010
Sure, sure.

23:33.314 --> 23:36.050
Breen Nash, I know two things.

23:39.253 --> 23:43.991
How to get dicks hard and
that boy is not Huckle.

23:44.024 --> 23:45.159
What are you up to?

23:45.192 --> 23:46.994
Huckle is in rehab.

23:48.896 --> 23:50.731
Oh bless his heart.

23:50.764 --> 23:51.932
Is he shootin' again?

23:51.966 --> 23:56.437
No, no, but I'm about to
lose financing for "Beast Moon"

23:56.470 --> 24:00.274
and if I don't start shooting,
like now,

24:00.307 --> 24:02.042
then it's a problem.

24:03.077 --> 24:06.714
I need that guy to look like
Huckle for a couple of weeks,

24:06.747 --> 24:07.715
can you do that for me?

24:07.748 --> 24:09.416
You shoulda just told me.

24:09.450 --> 24:12.920
Eyes yes, hair yes, skin yes,
scars, no.

24:15.055 --> 24:17.224
There's always surgery.

24:17.258 --> 24:18.792
I'm not having
surgery!

24:18.826 --> 24:21.295
Not you baby, you're perfect.

24:22.963 --> 24:26.400
He's disfigured, I can't
possibly cover those scars

24:26.433 --> 24:27.635
for the camera.

24:27.667 --> 24:29.770
Don't you have some kind of
a magic make-up to cover it

24:29.803 --> 24:32.006
or know somebody that does?

24:34.775 --> 24:36.377
I may know someone.

24:37.244 --> 24:40.447
I met him through Trammel
Steadfast.

24:40.481 --> 24:43.817
Wait a minute, isn't that
that psycho make-up artist

24:43.851 --> 24:48.389
that attacked his crew
and jumped off a bridge?

24:48.422 --> 24:52.359
If I make this call,
there's no turning back.

24:58.432 --> 24:59.967
Make that call.

25:07.841 --> 25:09.777
Baby, listen sweetie.

25:11.512 --> 25:15.249
Remember that friend of yours
with that special lotion?

25:36.103 --> 25:37.438
Sorry I'm late.

25:41.909 --> 25:43.777
You were instructed to come
alone.

25:43.811 --> 25:44.945
What, I did.

25:46.513 --> 25:48.882
Then who's that?

25:48.916 --> 25:52.253
Beez, I told you to stay down.

25:52.286 --> 25:54.455
Sorry that's Mr. Beez, he's
cool.

25:54.488 --> 25:57.524
I mean he's not gonna talk
to the cops or anything.

25:57.558 --> 26:00.094
Why I just brought the police
into this mess is beyond me

26:00.127 --> 26:04.064
because there's nothing
illegal happening here.

26:05.299 --> 26:07.268
I didn't bring any cash, you
know,

26:07.301 --> 26:08.135
I didn't know how much it would
be

26:08.168 --> 26:09.270
but I do have a company check
so...

26:09.303 --> 26:14.375
The price would not be
measured by gold but by blood.

26:16.110 --> 26:17.778
Beez, cut it out.

26:20.281 --> 26:21.815
I'm sorry, blood?

26:23.050 --> 26:28.188
If I were to rip your heart
out of your chest, right now,

26:30.424 --> 26:32.026
what would I find?

26:33.027 --> 26:36.063
You know, I've never been
great with the hypothetical.

26:36.096 --> 26:37.298
Good or evil?

26:42.403 --> 26:44.938
I'm gonna pick good.

26:44.972 --> 26:46.874
I mean I'm kind to animals,
right?

26:46.907 --> 26:48.375
And I never litter.

26:49.143 --> 26:53.814
You are what you are and
will become what you are,

26:55.115 --> 26:57.918
no matter what you think you
are.

27:00.054 --> 27:02.389
I'm sorry, did I miss
something here?

27:02.423 --> 27:06.226
What you seek is right
there on the ground.

27:11.365 --> 27:12.366
Wow.

27:14.968 --> 27:18.205
The extract can be used at any
time

27:18.238 --> 27:22.309
but will not work fully
until the witching hour.

27:25.512 --> 27:28.248
And when you say witching hour
you mean?

27:28.282 --> 27:29.450
Midnight.

27:29.483 --> 27:30.451
Copy that.

27:34.288 --> 27:35.989
What is inside will be
outside,

27:36.023 --> 27:39.026
what is underneath will be
revealed.

27:41.228 --> 27:43.430
Now go, you've been warned.

27:46.233 --> 27:47.968
No I'm sorry, I...

27:56.977 --> 27:58.612
Did you see that guy?

27:58.645 --> 28:00.981
I mean the whole ensemble?

28:01.716 --> 28:05.652
The hair, oh, guys like
that, they make me feel

28:07.287 --> 28:09.656
like I just need to be
more assertive, right?

28:10.991 --> 28:12.393
What, don't laugh.

28:16.697 --> 28:20.634
I'm just saying, we could
be in over our heads.

28:23.337 --> 28:27.074
I love you Beez.

28:36.483 --> 28:41.121
I gave him enough Xanax to
knock out the real Huckle.

28:43.157 --> 28:44.958
Is that stuff safe?

28:48.529 --> 28:50.464
Completely safe, hon.

28:52.065 --> 28:56.336
You just sit back and relax,
you won't feel a thing.

29:41.381 --> 29:43.383
What is
inside will be outside,

29:43.417 --> 29:47.120
what is underneath will be
revealed.

29:47.154 --> 29:49.022
Don't use the cream.

29:56.630 --> 29:58.565
Hey champ, how was the nap?

29:58.599 --> 30:00.701
Wow you really passed out for a
bit there.

30:00.735 --> 30:03.537
Now I can call you Huckle.

30:03.570 --> 30:06.206
Some of my scars are still
here.

30:06.240 --> 30:07.207
Don't worry about that, I
mean,

30:07.241 --> 30:10.210
it's not even supposed
to work until midnight.

30:10.244 --> 30:13.680
I don't know Breen, what
if I'm not good at this.

30:13.715 --> 30:16.083
What are you talking about?
Nobody is gonna notice.

30:16.116 --> 30:18.051
Okay, and just get through
that first meeting with Scram

30:18.085 --> 30:19.386
and we can buy a little time

30:19.419 --> 30:22.356
and start working on Flex, your
wife.

30:22.389 --> 30:23.524
Wife?

30:23.557 --> 30:24.658
Yeah.

30:24.691 --> 30:27.394
What if she wants me to, you
know?

30:28.562 --> 30:29.831
Breen, you fuck, it's
D!

30:29.864 --> 30:31.465
Oh, Dustin, god.

30:32.599 --> 30:35.703
He's probably here to beg me
for a role on "Beast Moon."

30:35.737 --> 30:37.504
Fuck you, open the fucking
door.

30:37.538 --> 30:39.640
Dustin Foxxx the movie star?

30:39.673 --> 30:41.743
"Vampire Knights?"

30:41.776 --> 30:44.511
By Lancelot's light, I thy
vampire knight.

30:44.545 --> 30:47.114
What are you doin', don't
do that. He hates you.

30:47.147 --> 30:48.048
Why?

30:48.081 --> 30:51.218
Because you slept with his
wife twice.

30:51.251 --> 30:53.287
Now sit down and don't say a
word, okay?

30:54.288 --> 30:56.456
Open this fucking
door Breen.

30:56.490 --> 30:58.258
Hey buddy.

30:58.292 --> 31:00.862
I want a role in "Beast Moon"
Breen.

31:00.895 --> 31:02.797
We can talk about this at the
office.

31:02.830 --> 31:05.532
Bullshit, I know you're
greenlit.

31:05.566 --> 31:07.367
Yeah, I thought I smelled you
Fuckle.

31:07.401 --> 31:10.337
You know what, I want supporting
Breen.

31:10.370 --> 31:11.505
And none of that scale shit!

31:11.538 --> 31:16.143
Oh no, you're top of the
list buddy, top of the list!

31:16.176 --> 31:19.212
Oh my god, he believed
it, I'm him, I'm Huckle.

31:19.246 --> 31:21.281
No you're not and I said shut
up, okay,

31:21.315 --> 31:22.583
so that means shut up.

31:22.616 --> 31:25.419
You put me in that fucking
movie Breen!

31:25.452 --> 31:28.522
I'm gonna call your agent D.

31:28.555 --> 31:30.490
Oh god I hate his agent.

31:30.524 --> 31:32.659
Suckle Fagston.

31:36.630 --> 31:40.233
Hey buddy, kinda just have one
bathroom.

31:41.568 --> 31:44.137
No, what the fuck is this?

32:03.690 --> 32:05.592
So I need to be wrapping this
up.

32:05.626 --> 32:06.693
You thought I was a monster on
set

32:06.728 --> 32:08.362
when we shot "Gods of Pluto."

32:08.395 --> 32:09.496
Watch what happens

32:09.529 --> 32:12.499
if you don't get me something
good in "Beast Moon."

32:12.532 --> 32:14.802
I don't even care that "Gods
of Pluto" sucked so much,

32:14.836 --> 32:15.937
you know why?

32:15.970 --> 32:18.706
'Cause I believe there are
different spaces and times

32:18.740 --> 32:20.607
and universes out there,

32:20.641 --> 32:23.945
that are the exact opposite of
our own.

32:23.978 --> 32:26.546
So somewhere, somewhere out
there,

32:26.580 --> 32:28.916
"Gods of Pluto" is the
biggest hit of all time

32:28.950 --> 32:32.419
and I am the biggest star in
that world.

32:37.892 --> 32:42.830
You sleep with my wife again,
I'll fucking stab you Huckle.

32:49.403 --> 32:50.604
Did he leave?

32:53.373 --> 32:55.442
Thank god, I hate actors.

33:03.785 --> 33:05.585
Goddammit, oh shit.

33:24.772 --> 33:28.810
Man I miss the old days when
pot used to be illegal man.

33:28.843 --> 33:30.510
Especially when I needed some
weed,

33:30.544 --> 33:32.312
I used to down to the park

33:32.345 --> 33:35.983
and just bust some kids
and take their shit.

33:36.017 --> 33:37.651
Hey, I think I heard
something.

33:37.684 --> 33:40.021
They always used to
complain and shit about it...

33:40.054 --> 33:41.588
Burt, hey Burt!

33:44.324 --> 33:45.325
Burt!

33:45.358 --> 33:46.127
What?

33:46.160 --> 33:46.828
Man come on, I just got
demoted,

33:46.861 --> 33:48.896
I ain't trying to do a desk job.

33:48.930 --> 33:50.732
I think I heard a noise.

33:50.765 --> 33:54.301
Well congratulations
Reynolds, how 'bout this?

33:57.471 --> 34:00.607
Oh come on dude, I'm tryna eat
here.

34:04.344 --> 34:07.915
Sweetie wait, I didn't
know she was gonna be there.

34:07.949 --> 34:10.383
It's a party in the hills,
she's at most of them.

34:10.417 --> 34:11.518
Fuck you Doug.

34:15.322 --> 34:17.390
Hey, hey, stop, I swear

34:18.092 --> 34:19.626
I had no idea Jasmin was gonna
be here.

34:19.659 --> 34:21.963
You're such a lying piece of
shit.

34:21.996 --> 34:23.663
You're a bad lay, you're a bad
liar

34:23.697 --> 34:25.699
and I saw you giving her the
fuck me eyes.

34:25.733 --> 34:27.300
Stay away from me.

34:27.334 --> 34:28.668
Just be logical.

34:32.672 --> 34:34.709
What the fuck was that?

34:35.609 --> 34:40.313
I think we should just
get back to the house.

34:40.347 --> 34:42.349
Where the fuck is the house?

34:42.382 --> 34:43.918
I don't know.

34:57.732 --> 34:58.733
Oh my god!

35:20.620 --> 35:21.621
Oh fuck.

35:23.825 --> 35:25.893
I gotta stop doing drugs.

35:40.007 --> 35:42.977
Hey Muff, what's the
name of that publicist,

35:43.010 --> 35:44.779
Ronnie, Ronnie, Remy?

35:46.580 --> 35:48.682
Renny, Renny, Renny Black.

35:48.716 --> 35:51.518
Yes, yes, I need that guy's
number.

35:51.551 --> 35:53.587
And I also need you and Hampton

35:53.620 --> 35:54.454
to meet me down at Zelda's
salon.

35:54.487 --> 35:55.289
So what now?

35:55.323 --> 35:56.824
We're gonna tap into your bad
boy.

35:56.858 --> 35:58.692
I thought you said you
wanted me to be a good guy?

35:58.726 --> 36:00.527
I'll explain it in the car.

36:00.560 --> 36:01.561
No not you.

36:02.263 --> 36:04.866
Can you just, no I need Zelda.

36:05.800 --> 36:10.004
Yes, okay, let's just start at
the salon.

36:24.651 --> 36:26.453
You're going to
need to look like him,

36:26.486 --> 36:27.889
talk like him, walk like him

36:27.922 --> 36:31.458
and treat others exactly the way
he does.

36:54.849 --> 36:56.851
Okay, okay, you ready?

36:59.686 --> 37:00.687
Yeah.

37:03.124 --> 37:05.458
No, it's a lot of pressure

37:06.761 --> 37:08.129
to be in entirely different
person

37:08.162 --> 37:10.197
and a good actor in just four
days.

37:10.231 --> 37:13.000
Yeah but a good actor
could do both right?

37:13.034 --> 37:15.970
So be a good actor, you got
this.

37:16.003 --> 37:17.872
Besides, she's gonna
yell and scream at you

37:17.905 --> 37:20.074
and lock herself up in the room
anyway so,

37:20.107 --> 37:21.142
play dumb 'til that happens.

37:21.175 --> 37:22.009
Okay.

37:22.043 --> 37:24.577
Okay you got this.

37:24.611 --> 37:26.914
If you need anything, do not
call me.

37:31.218 --> 37:32.253
Okay thanks Breen.

37:49.837 --> 37:51.172
This is my house.

38:00.014 --> 38:01.015
Hello?

38:08.621 --> 38:11.759
Where the fuck have you been
Huckle?

38:13.160 --> 38:15.662
With Breen, training for
"Beast Moon."

38:15.695 --> 38:17.264
Great, thanks for calling
asshole.

38:17.298 --> 38:18.833
How was your night Flex?

38:18.866 --> 38:20.167
I puked up blood while our maid

38:20.201 --> 38:22.236
called me a.

38:22.269 --> 38:26.307
And I know that means something
derogatory so she quit.

38:26.340 --> 38:28.275
Or maybe I fired her.

38:28.309 --> 38:31.078
Haven't showered in a couple
days, wanna smell my pits?

38:31.112 --> 38:33.848
No, why would I wanna do that?

38:34.581 --> 38:38.886
You don't want stinky pits,
are you sick or something?

38:38.919 --> 38:42.589
No, I just, I just wanna tell
you

38:42.622 --> 38:44.691
to get ready for a change.

38:44.725 --> 38:48.561
The new me is gonna be
different than the old me.

38:48.595 --> 38:51.732
Holy shit, your eyes are
clear,

38:51.766 --> 38:53.901
are you getting fucking sober on
me?

38:53.934 --> 38:56.237
You said we were never getting
sober unless I got knocked up

38:56.270 --> 38:58.039
and there's no fucking way

38:58.072 --> 39:00.341
I am letting you destroy this
body.

39:00.374 --> 39:03.177
Can I have $5,000 for Rodeo
Drive today?

39:03.210 --> 39:05.880
I don't have $5,000.

39:05.913 --> 39:07.680
I mean on me.

39:07.715 --> 39:10.650
Fine, keep your precious
money.

39:10.683 --> 39:11.519
You'll see what happens

39:11.551 --> 39:14.255
when my moon-tan lotion starts
selling.

39:14.288 --> 39:15.823
I hate you again.

39:17.758 --> 39:20.828
I'm sorry, can you forgive me
Flex?

39:23.831 --> 39:25.299
What did you say?

39:28.102 --> 39:29.103
I'm sorry?

39:31.172 --> 39:33.107
Say it again.

39:33.140 --> 39:35.608
I'm sorry for being a jerk.

39:35.642 --> 39:37.111
You deserve better.

39:40.815 --> 39:43.184
We are driving up the
coast tonight for dins,

39:43.217 --> 39:48.122
then you're going down on me
for dessert, front and back.

39:48.155 --> 39:50.091
Maybe I'll order beans.

39:53.761 --> 39:54.728
Huh?

39:58.365 --> 39:59.366
Oh.

40:09.009 --> 40:11.245
I have to speak for
this studio here Huck,

40:11.278 --> 40:13.047
we don't need any bad PR.

40:13.080 --> 40:15.149
It was sexy in the beginning,

40:15.182 --> 40:16.984
return of the Hollywood bad boy

40:17.017 --> 40:19.320
but now it's just a distraction.

40:19.353 --> 40:22.756
Yeah, you feel this don't you
geezer?

40:23.424 --> 40:27.428
Ma'am, Scram, I'm a
totally different person.

40:27.461 --> 40:29.230
If you can bet on me on BM,

40:29.263 --> 40:34.201
we can shoot two and three back
to back for half the racks.

40:40.107 --> 40:43.277
We'll fast track "Beast Moon"
for a fall release, Scram?

40:43.310 --> 40:45.880
Well we'll have to dump "Dance
Blade 4,"

40:45.913 --> 40:47.214
push the "Vampire Knights"
revamp

40:47.248 --> 40:50.050
for February, that'll work.

40:50.084 --> 40:51.919
Is that good for you Breen?

40:51.952 --> 40:54.155
Yes, that's great for me.

40:55.723 --> 40:57.458
Huckle we need a moment with
Breen.

40:57.491 --> 41:00.027
Oh, thank you ma'am, Scram.

41:02.463 --> 41:03.297
I'll be outside.

41:03.330 --> 41:05.199
I'll be right there.

41:06.200 --> 41:09.236
You see, brand new Huck, right?

41:09.270 --> 41:12.006
Breen, you're a moron.

41:12.039 --> 41:12.706
I am?

41:12.740 --> 41:14.408
You got his head too straight.

41:14.441 --> 41:15.109
I do?

41:15.142 --> 41:16.911
We don't want him thanking us.

41:16.944 --> 41:18.078
Calling me sir?

41:18.112 --> 41:20.414
Jeez, Ali had security standing
by

41:20.447 --> 41:22.316
thinkin' he might trash the
place.

41:22.349 --> 41:23.517
That's why he's bankable.

41:23.551 --> 41:28.322
We want him on time, sober,
clean, focused on the film

41:28.355 --> 41:32.493
but let's keep him interesting
and entertaining, you idiot.

41:32.526 --> 41:33.460
I got this.

41:33.494 --> 41:35.996
I realize you're completely
incompetent.

41:36.030 --> 41:37.932
But you can handle it, can't you
Breen?

41:37.965 --> 41:40.434
Of course I can, I mean
it's...

41:40.467 --> 41:43.404
Don't fuck this up Breen.

41:49.109 --> 41:53.113
I just love a good white
Wonder Bread sandwich

41:53.914 --> 41:58.252
with some thick white
meat completely covered

41:58.285 --> 42:01.121
in some hot sticky white mess.

42:03.190 --> 42:05.226
That sounds delicious.

42:05.259 --> 42:08.128
You a sandwich guy Breen?

42:08.162 --> 42:11.732
I don't think she's talking
about lunch.

42:16.437 --> 42:18.239
Ice 'em down Finny.

42:19.173 --> 42:20.241
Ice 'em down.

42:22.476 --> 42:26.280
Will the real fucking
Huckle please stand up?

42:28.849 --> 42:30.050
What a jag off.

42:35.022 --> 42:37.191
So he just stood there?

42:37.224 --> 42:40.828
Then he took her to
dinner, no drugs, no booze,

42:40.861 --> 42:43.831
lotta beans, he's gonna
be shitting for a week.

42:43.864 --> 42:46.100
Good, he knew you were
watching.

42:46.133 --> 42:50.537
Nobody ever sees me
watchin' ever, you got it?

42:50.571 --> 42:53.507
Oh for god's sake Chrome,
I'm on your side, let go.

42:53.540 --> 42:57.578
I want that fuckin' file you
fat Ironside fuckin' cripple.

42:57.611 --> 42:59.546
And you will have it.

43:00.514 --> 43:02.416
As soon as you get me proof

43:02.449 --> 43:05.286
that Huckle is doing something
illegal.

43:05.319 --> 43:07.888
I need the ability to destroy
him

43:07.921 --> 43:10.190
in order to get you your file.

43:10.224 --> 43:12.126
You pass arithmetic?

43:12.159 --> 43:14.895
Take a look, see the ink
on his right ass cheek?

43:14.928 --> 43:16.964
That's a bullseye tattoo, right?

43:16.997 --> 43:17.998
All right.

43:20.234 --> 43:22.836
Why is this one clean as a
baby's ass?

43:22.870 --> 43:25.072
Where's the fuckin' tattoo?

43:26.140 --> 43:27.274
What are you suggesting?

43:27.308 --> 43:31.378
I'm suggesting that this
ass don't belong to Huckle.

43:31.412 --> 43:33.414
Not the real one anyway.

43:34.214 --> 43:36.550
These guys, they're always using
doubles

43:36.583 --> 43:38.519
in the movie pictures, right?

43:38.552 --> 43:39.754
Why would he replace himself?

43:39.788 --> 43:44.325
Because the fucking barracudas
that run the movie studios,

43:44.358 --> 43:46.093
they create these actors right?

43:46.126 --> 43:48.429
Who better to replace them?

43:48.462 --> 43:51.332
You think Wooly Workingstiff's
got any idea what,

43:51.365 --> 43:52.566
like, fucking time of day it is?

43:52.599 --> 43:54.068
You think he's gonna know the
difference

43:54.101 --> 43:56.603
between a real actor and a
fugazi?

43:56.637 --> 43:59.039
Oh my god, you are right.

44:00.040 --> 44:04.211
Which begs the hundred
billion dollar question.

44:04.244 --> 44:07.514
Where's the real Huckle
Saxton?

44:30.971 --> 44:31.972
Hello?

44:37.044 --> 44:38.045
Hello?

44:41.415 --> 44:44.151
I gotta stop doing so much blow.

44:48.555 --> 44:50.023
And drink water.

44:58.098 --> 44:59.166
Brown Bomber?

45:07.408 --> 45:08.542
What the fuck?

45:10.444 --> 45:12.379
Help, somebody help me!

45:16.683 --> 45:19.086
Fuck my legs, I can't move.

45:21.321 --> 45:23.457
I'm Huckle fucking Saxton.

45:24.491 --> 45:27.428
Somebody call my manager,
fuckers!

45:32.232 --> 45:35.536
You can't keep doing this
Huckle.

45:35.569 --> 45:37.070
I can't support charities?

45:37.104 --> 45:39.273
Not dressed respectably.

45:39.306 --> 45:41.709
Give him some space chalk
stick.

45:41.743 --> 45:44.746
Out of nowhere, you're
so big yet so stealthy.

45:44.779 --> 45:46.714
You heard her, give me some
space.

45:46.748 --> 45:49.082
I'm trying to manage you.

45:49.116 --> 45:51.351
I was doing just fine until I
met you.

45:51.385 --> 45:52.686
Ooh!

45:52.720 --> 45:53.822
Shut up idiot.

45:53.855 --> 45:55.589
- You see that's better.
- All right, you can get out,

45:55.622 --> 45:59.293
get out, get out, shut
the door behind you.

46:00.795 --> 46:04.698
Maybe I'll make Nectarine my new
manager.

46:04.732 --> 46:06.734
Eat a nectarine, Breen.

46:10.037 --> 46:12.372
I'm so disappointed in you.

46:14.141 --> 46:15.676
I'm off to Crafty.

46:22.449 --> 46:25.085
You need anything puddin' pop?

46:25.118 --> 46:28.055
Okay, so you when I'm back.

46:37.765 --> 46:40.033
What's happening to me?

47:04.157 --> 47:05.158
Invincible.

47:40.527 --> 47:42.462
You know, all things
considered,

47:42.496 --> 47:44.832
things are going pretty well.

47:49.336 --> 47:51.471
Maybe a little too well.

47:57.544 --> 47:59.546
Huckle you've got an
interview...

47:59.580 --> 48:00.614
So?

48:00.647 --> 48:03.617
Okay, okay, okay, listen
up everybody, all right,

48:03.650 --> 48:06.553
don't forget I've got free
drinks on me tonight at The Cove.

48:06.587 --> 48:09.757
How about free drinks
on Breen right now?

48:13.427 --> 48:14.561
All right, that's funny,

48:14.595 --> 48:16.196
we've got our yayas out right
there,

48:16.229 --> 48:17.664
how 'bout we get back to work?

48:17.698 --> 48:19.266
I'm gonna go change my shirt.

48:19.299 --> 48:20.434
Woo!

48:21.936 --> 48:24.806
Everyone take one, I'll be
back.

48:42.289 --> 48:43.423
Who's there?

49:01.208 --> 49:02.275
Am I in hell?

49:13.620 --> 49:15.689
Listen geniuses, this is the
last time

49:15.723 --> 49:18.191
I'm wearing this thing so,
try not to fuck my shit up

49:18.225 --> 49:19.593
when you apply the mask this
time?

49:19.626 --> 49:21.328
We're really sorry about the
rash,

49:21.361 --> 49:22.930
the application will be just
fine.

49:22.964 --> 49:26.366
You think, well then fuck you
two.

49:26.400 --> 49:28.235
Y'all seen my phone?

49:28.268 --> 49:29.236
I already checked my...

49:29.269 --> 49:33.340
Wait a minute, that
was my first suggestion.

49:33.373 --> 49:35.509
Oh, there it is, got it.

49:40.815 --> 49:43.951
You could learn a lot from
that girl.

49:43.985 --> 49:45.452
She's all class.

49:48.522 --> 49:49.656
This occupied.

49:49.690 --> 49:50.691
It's me.

49:54.394 --> 49:56.898
Look, he's not doing drugs
but he's doing something.

49:56.931 --> 49:58.733
It is all on that camera.

49:58.766 --> 50:01.936
So after this tell
Finnegan, I'm done, I'm out.

50:01.969 --> 50:03.905
Would you like nacho?

50:21.789 --> 50:22.990
How're you feeling Huckle?

50:23.024 --> 50:25.358
You know that masks' great
but it's kind of firm on your...

50:31.698 --> 50:33.366
Get away from me!

50:34.869 --> 50:36.738
I will kill you.

50:44.779 --> 50:47.749
Huckle, don't kill me, I love
you!

51:28.723 --> 51:29.957
Wow.

51:30.858 --> 51:32.526
This looks amazing.

51:34.862 --> 51:38.465
I mean, it's a complete waste of
materials

51:38.498 --> 51:40.433
but this looks awesome.

51:44.872 --> 51:47.809
It isn't make-up
Breen.

51:49.576 --> 51:51.712
They said it would come off
if I yank it from the bottom

51:51.746 --> 51:53.881
but it just pulls my skin.

51:55.917 --> 51:57.785
Scars came back Breen.

51:59.854 --> 52:02.622
So I put on the cream
and it struck midnight

52:02.656 --> 52:03.858
and now I can't take it off!

52:03.891 --> 52:08.395
Wait, wait, just calm down,
take a breath, all right?

52:10.898 --> 52:12.033
You think
the Hollywood lifestyle's

52:12.066 --> 52:13.234
getting to me?

52:13.267 --> 52:15.870
Think your grooming process
maybe went a little too far?

52:15.903 --> 52:17.571
It's just make-up
okay, we can get it off,

52:17.604 --> 52:21.441
we'll take it off, just take it
easy.

52:21.474 --> 52:24.745
It isn't just
make-up Breen.

52:27.447 --> 52:28.448
Okay.

52:30.617 --> 52:32.586
I can feel it.

52:32.619 --> 52:34.021
Okay.

52:34.055 --> 52:36.590
I didn't want to.

52:37.725 --> 52:42.096
I told them to get away
but then I had to eat them.

52:44.664 --> 52:47.869
And now I'm going to eat you too
Breen.

52:56.576 --> 52:59.113
Eat me, why would you want to
eat me?

52:59.146 --> 53:01.148
I'm just skin and bones!

53:33.180 --> 53:35.850
I told you to stop asking me.

53:36.884 --> 53:41.588
You ask me again, your client's
gonna start losing points.

53:41.621 --> 53:42.890
One, two, three.

53:52.565 --> 53:54.235
Did you hear me?

53:54.268 --> 53:56.503
And you ever bother me again

53:56.536 --> 53:59.472
after 8 o' clock in the middle
of my run,

53:59.506 --> 54:02.642
I'm gonna find you, I'm
gonna eat you alive,

54:02.676 --> 54:04.078
then I'm gonna find your client,

54:04.111 --> 54:06.714
I'm gonna eat him alive
and then for dessert,

54:06.747 --> 54:08.749
I'm gonna eat your wife.

54:18.759 --> 54:20.761
We have a 1091

54:20.795 --> 54:23.130
near the Woodrow Wilson
Boulevard,

54:23.164 --> 54:27.667
I repeat, a vicious animal
attack near your location.

54:27.701 --> 54:28.769
Sanchez, Reynolds,

54:28.803 --> 54:30.670
you playing with each
other's ding-a-lings again?

54:30.705 --> 54:31.739
Sanchez here.

54:31.772 --> 54:34.041
That was a rumor, it was
just Greek yogurt Sarge.

54:34.075 --> 54:35.642
Yeah, the lab said
otherwise.

54:35.675 --> 54:36.643
But Sarge...

54:36.676 --> 54:38.145
Shut the fuck up.

54:38.179 --> 54:40.680
The mayor's mistress
called, her dog was attacked

54:40.715 --> 54:43.050
right where you two assholes are
parked,

54:43.084 --> 54:46.619
keep your eyes peeled and
your hands off your cocks.

54:46.653 --> 54:49.924
Eyes and ears open sir,
we will shoot on sight.

54:49.957 --> 54:51.258
Shoot to kill Sarge.

54:51.292 --> 54:53.227
You fucking idiots.

54:53.260 --> 54:55.997
You keep your sidearms
holstered, locate the suspect

54:56.030 --> 54:58.766
and contact Animal Control,
understood?

54:58.799 --> 55:01.068
Understood but that was Greek
yogurt!

55:01.102 --> 55:03.070
What a fuckin' asshole man,

55:03.104 --> 55:04.705
why don't he call Animal
Control,

55:04.739 --> 55:07.308
what the fuck we look like?

55:07.341 --> 55:09.542
We are police officers.

55:09.576 --> 55:11.879
Hey man, do you think we're
gonna do,

55:11.912 --> 55:12.747
you know what I'm sayin?

55:12.780 --> 55:14.715
Watch this, watch this.

55:16.951 --> 55:20.553
Hotbox, that's what the fuck I'm
gonna do.

55:23.090 --> 55:25.026
Yeah okay you're right.

55:27.762 --> 55:28.796
The fuck was that?

55:46.847 --> 55:49.316
Hey, what's the emergency?

55:49.350 --> 55:52.787
Okay, minor wrinkle but
Huck has literally turned

55:52.820 --> 55:54.188
into the monster from "Beast
Moon."

55:54.221 --> 55:56.957
Wait, he's acting like
the monster from the movie?

55:56.991 --> 56:00.127
Not acting, he is the
monster from the movie.

56:00.161 --> 56:03.130
He kinda went crazy and killed
Keemsee

56:03.164 --> 56:04.131
and Karla a little bit.

56:04.165 --> 56:04.999
Where is he?

56:05.032 --> 56:05.966
I don't know.

56:06.000 --> 56:07.600
Guys, guys, I set his phone
for tracking

56:07.634 --> 56:09.370
after the whole Betty White
fiasco.

56:09.403 --> 56:10.938
You know, he really
should have won that fight.

56:11.671 --> 56:14.008
Whoa, he's already in west LA.

56:14.041 --> 56:15.709
Wait, on foot?

56:15.743 --> 56:16.977
This is all my fault.

56:17.011 --> 56:18.012
Look, do you still have those
tranqs

56:18.045 --> 56:18.979
in the back of your car?

56:19.013 --> 56:19.814
Of course.

56:19.847 --> 56:22.349
Okay, you tidy up here and
we'll...

56:22.383 --> 56:25.853
Whoa, whoa, tidy up double
homicide?

56:25.886 --> 56:27.288
Look do you want that producer
credit?

56:27.321 --> 56:28.756
It'll open so many doors.

56:28.789 --> 56:30.257
Then go get some cleaning
supplies,

56:30.291 --> 56:34.195
make this place spotless
and I will consider it.

56:34.228 --> 56:35.930
What, I said I'd consider it.

56:36.997 --> 56:37.965
Okay he stopped.

56:37.998 --> 56:39.200
Where?

56:39.233 --> 56:40.234
His house.

56:42.770 --> 56:44.905
Okay, in you go, you go.

56:47.775 --> 56:49.243
I've got your back.

56:57.785 --> 56:58.786
Okay.

57:10.931 --> 57:11.932
Upstairs.

57:18.105 --> 57:19.106
Okay, go.

57:26.747 --> 57:28.949
Did I turn off the stove?

57:30.117 --> 57:32.720
Have I ever even used the stove?

57:43.430 --> 57:44.431
Oh shit.

57:45.266 --> 57:47.134
It's all good in here.

57:53.807 --> 57:57.211
I can't get this mask off
Breen, it's...

58:02.216 --> 58:04.351
Zelda hi, it's Breen.

58:04.385 --> 58:07.821
Is there something you may
have forgotten to tell me?

58:07.855 --> 58:09.790
It's pulling my fucking face.

58:09.823 --> 58:11.325
Breen, Breen, I'm telling you

58:11.358 --> 58:12.960
there's something evil about
this cream.

58:12.993 --> 58:14.061
Hold on buddy, hold on.

58:14.094 --> 58:16.696
So did you tell me everything?

58:17.932 --> 58:21.202
- Yes about the cream.
- Hold still.

58:21.235 --> 58:25.206
I'm sorry, what do you
mean about the oopsie?

58:25.239 --> 58:26.240
Uh-huh.

58:27.808 --> 58:29.376
Like they turn into beasts and
eat people,

58:29.410 --> 58:31.445
that minor detail?

58:31.478 --> 58:34.014
Yeah, yeah, that's a problem.

58:35.049 --> 58:38.185
I need you to get to Hux now.

58:38.219 --> 58:41.155
Oh, I thought you said he was
dead?

58:43.857 --> 58:46.460
Okay then I need to find
Trammel.

59:13.487 --> 59:15.089
What are you doing with the
cream?

59:15.122 --> 59:16.423
Did you use it?

59:16.457 --> 59:17.124
Did you touch it?

59:17.157 --> 59:19.960
No, I was just looking at it.

59:21.195 --> 59:22.196
Jesus.

59:23.397 --> 59:25.132
What is this shit Breen?

59:25.165 --> 59:26.500
I have no idea.

59:28.035 --> 59:31.305
Here, I need you to find
this guy, Trammel Steadfast.

59:31.338 --> 59:33.207
Yeah from MASQ.Effects.

59:33.240 --> 59:34.174
What you know him?

59:34.208 --> 59:36.510
Yeah I mean I PA'd
on "Eat Me Alive Five."

59:36.543 --> 59:38.145
He's a genius with masks.

59:38.178 --> 59:42.216
I hope so, he may be our
only chance to save Michael.

59:42.249 --> 59:43.884
You mean Huckle?

59:43.917 --> 59:45.519
No, I mean Michael.

59:47.187 --> 59:48.789
You missed a spot.

1:00:22.990 --> 1:00:24.458
Oh, oh yeah baby.

1:00:35.502 --> 1:00:38.238
Ice 'em down baby, ice 'em down.

1:00:49.516 --> 1:00:52.586
Five second rule, five second
rule!

1:01:04.665 --> 1:01:05.866
I feel fine.

1:01:07.534 --> 1:01:09.536
And that never happened.

1:01:59.486 --> 1:02:01.054
Sometimes I think you're
the only real thing

1:02:01.088 --> 1:02:02.222
around here Beez.

1:02:13.167 --> 1:02:15.702
Mr. Beez, am I happy to see you.

1:02:44.465 --> 1:02:47.769
If I end up on the river Styx,

1:02:47.802 --> 1:02:52.473
I will spit in Death's eye
and take my chances in hell.

1:03:22.402 --> 1:03:24.137
Hey Breen, it's
Hampton,

1:03:24.171 --> 1:03:25.572
getting pretty close to
Trammel's house

1:03:25.606 --> 1:03:28.208
so I'll let you know when I'm
coming back

1:03:28.242 --> 1:03:32.179
and you see me as a
producer after this, right?

1:04:02.710 --> 1:04:05.345
- What do you want fat man?
- How'd you like to know

1:04:05.379 --> 1:04:08.682
what's really going on with
Huckle Saxton?

1:04:08.716 --> 1:04:11.485
Why Breen won't allow you near
him on set?

1:04:11.518 --> 1:04:14.121
Why he's now such a sweet little
angel?

1:04:14.154 --> 1:04:15.489
Who says I care about that?

1:04:15.522 --> 1:04:17.558
Oh don't show your ass to me.

1:04:17.591 --> 1:04:20.694
I suppose you like being made a
fool of?

1:04:20.728 --> 1:04:23.096
Oh maybe you get off

1:04:23.130 --> 1:04:27.701
on being the rim of the
studio system's asshole?

1:04:27.735 --> 1:04:30.470
Huck and Breen are fleecing you.

1:04:31.138 --> 1:04:35.275
And it's real Scram, it
makes scars disappear,

1:04:35.309 --> 1:04:38.078
wrinkles vanish, assholes
pucker.

1:04:42.382 --> 1:04:43.718
And there's more.

1:04:45.686 --> 1:04:46.721
What do you want fat man?

1:04:46.754 --> 1:04:49.222
I want the non-redacted
file of the hit and run

1:04:49.256 --> 1:04:52.693
you studio goons covered up in
2004.

1:04:52.727 --> 1:04:54.261
There was no hit and run.

1:04:54.294 --> 1:04:56.864
Okay then, maybe I'll
just put this little video

1:04:56.898 --> 1:04:58.498
up on ZMT tonight.

1:05:00.667 --> 1:05:01.836
How much?

1:05:01.869 --> 1:05:06.406
Oh Scram old boy, some things
are worth more than money.

1:05:19.653 --> 1:05:20.654
Hello?

1:05:25.525 --> 1:05:27.729
Mr. Ezequiel, Mr. Ezequiel?

1:05:33.333 --> 1:05:35.402
Hello, hey, whoa, hey.

1:05:35.435 --> 1:05:38.271
How did you do that, I just.

1:05:38.305 --> 1:05:41.909
Anyway, I'm not clear
on your return policy

1:05:41.943 --> 1:05:44.645
but this lovely stuff is just
not for me

1:05:44.678 --> 1:05:48.816
so if you could be so
kind and take it back.

1:05:48.850 --> 1:05:51.518
It doesn't work like that.

1:05:51.551 --> 1:05:52.954
It doesn't work like that?

1:05:52.987 --> 1:05:55.555
Well it's not like you gave me a
manual.

1:05:55.589 --> 1:05:58.525
The flower doesn't
sacrifice its life to heal,

1:05:58.558 --> 1:06:00.427
it does so to cleanse.

1:06:01.194 --> 1:06:03.697
Wait a second, you already
knew

1:06:03.731 --> 1:06:06.500
that it turned people into
monsters?

1:06:06.533 --> 1:06:11.471
They turned into monsters
because they are monsters, see.

1:06:12.840 --> 1:06:15.242
I see you've been marked.

1:06:15.275 --> 1:06:18.746
Oh no no, that's just a
little accident, some spillage.

1:06:18.780 --> 1:06:22.784
At midnight tonight you will
be judged by the flower.

1:06:22.817 --> 1:06:25.285
You may still have time.

1:06:25.318 --> 1:06:27.889
Stamp out the evil you have
unleashed

1:06:27.922 --> 1:06:29.656
or become a part of it.

1:06:29.690 --> 1:06:30.758
What do you mean become a part
of it?

1:06:30.792 --> 1:06:32.727
I don't want anything to do with
this.

1:06:32.760 --> 1:06:34.428
I mean, what if I mess up?

1:06:34.461 --> 1:06:35.830
I might already be a bad person,

1:06:35.863 --> 1:06:38.465
Hollywood does that to people.

1:06:40.534 --> 1:06:45.205
Either you help people in
this life or you harm them.

1:06:46.306 --> 1:06:48.241
Make your choice Breen.

1:06:56.316 --> 1:07:00.988
If we meet again, my blade
will be the last thing you see.

1:07:12.432 --> 1:07:13.266
Hey hey.

1:07:13.300 --> 1:07:14.334
Get a fucking job.

1:07:14.367 --> 1:07:15.770
Oh no, you watch movies?

1:07:15.803 --> 1:07:17.270
"Gods of Pluto."

1:07:18.106 --> 1:07:20.640
You consider that piece
of crap a movie, here,

1:07:20.674 --> 1:07:22.375
here pal keep it.

1:07:22.409 --> 1:07:23.677
"Gods of Pluto."

1:07:26.379 --> 1:07:28.916
Ice 'em down baby, ice 'em down.

1:07:34.789 --> 1:07:38.525
Huckle, Huckle you low
life fucking scumbag.

1:10:12.113 --> 1:10:13.080
Hello?

1:10:26.493 --> 1:10:28.896
Oh my god, don't shoot.

1:10:28.930 --> 1:10:30.064
Zelda sent me.

1:10:31.866 --> 1:10:32.867
Zelda.

1:10:34.902 --> 1:10:36.871
I wouldn't smile if I were
you.

1:10:36.904 --> 1:10:39.639
You're standing on a landmine.

1:10:42.575 --> 1:10:44.779
Oh my god, Mr. Steadfast,

1:10:46.546 --> 1:10:48.615
please I just have a few
questions.

1:10:48.648 --> 1:10:50.885
It's a matter of life and death.

1:10:50.918 --> 1:10:53.553
You see Mr. Steadfast, my boss
and I,

1:10:53.586 --> 1:10:55.189
the other producers and I...

1:10:55.222 --> 1:10:57.557
Wait, you're a producer?

1:10:58.993 --> 1:11:01.896
Anyway, we came across this
cream,

1:11:01.929 --> 1:11:04.698
it's got these amazing healing
properties

1:11:04.732 --> 1:11:07.600
and it's killing, oh, well
thanks,

1:11:09.804 --> 1:11:12.139
kinda parched from the drive.

1:11:16.676 --> 1:11:17.677
Damn, wow.

1:11:35.096 --> 1:11:36.197
Where's the cream now?

1:11:36.230 --> 1:11:38.565
Well, it's with my boss,

1:11:39.300 --> 1:11:42.236
it's already killed several
people.

1:11:42.269 --> 1:11:45.239
Below the line people
but people nonetheless.

1:11:45.272 --> 1:11:47.540
Then you're already too late
man,

1:11:47.574 --> 1:11:49.310
just take what's left, destroy
it

1:11:49.343 --> 1:11:51.112
and count yourself as lucky.

1:11:51.145 --> 1:11:53.314
What's it made of?

1:11:53.347 --> 1:11:54.581
What are the properties?

1:11:54.614 --> 1:11:56.250
Why does it make people so...

1:11:56.283 --> 1:11:59.120
The parasite is native to the
flower,

1:11:59.153 --> 1:12:01.922
it enters the host through the
pores,

1:12:01.956 --> 1:12:05.192
it feeds on the basis of human
emotions,

1:12:05.226 --> 1:12:09.030
anger, rage, jealousy,
hatred, anything evil.

1:12:16.103 --> 1:12:19.173
Decades ago on a shoot in Costa
Rica,

1:12:21.175 --> 1:12:24.644
I witnessed a Shaman's healing
ceremony.

1:12:25.980 --> 1:12:29.350
Well how did you know that was
real?

1:12:29.383 --> 1:12:31.986
I was the one who was saved.

1:12:33.320 --> 1:12:36.824
From the first application, it
took over.

1:12:39.126 --> 1:12:43.864
I felt great, I looked great,
made my actors look great.

1:12:46.633 --> 1:12:50.738
So I had it synthesized and
I sold it as M-A-S-Q, MASQ.

1:12:50.771 --> 1:12:53.974
And then as the checks
got bigger and bigger,

1:12:54.008 --> 1:12:56.310
the monster got bigger.

1:12:56.343 --> 1:12:59.947
And that was the beginning of
the end.

1:12:59.980 --> 1:13:03.317
Faking my death was my only way
out.

1:13:03.350 --> 1:13:06.619
Right, you used it, you seem
to be fine,

1:13:06.653 --> 1:13:10.791
come on, there's gotta be
a way to save me friend.

1:13:12.760 --> 1:13:17.031
Does your friend still
have some good in him?

1:13:17.064 --> 1:13:19.400
Do you want that producer
credit?

1:13:19.433 --> 1:13:21.035
I believe he does.

1:13:30.177 --> 1:13:34.982
Then you take this and
put it under his tongue.

1:13:35.015 --> 1:13:36.050
In his mouth?

1:13:36.083 --> 1:13:39.720
No in his ass, yes, in
his mouth under his tongue

1:13:39.753 --> 1:13:44.325
and if he's good, he won't
change into anything evil.

1:13:44.358 --> 1:13:47.228
If he's bad, the evil will
remain.

1:13:50.030 --> 1:13:52.366
Mr. Steadfast, I can't thank
you enough.

1:13:52.399 --> 1:13:54.168
I gotta go give this to him
right away,

1:13:54.201 --> 1:13:56.137
can you disarm this thing?

1:13:56.170 --> 1:13:58.172
These are just props.

1:14:01.709 --> 1:14:02.710
Go, go, go.

1:14:03.811 --> 1:14:04.879
Okay, okay.

1:14:06.914 --> 1:14:11.318
You just remember kid,
celebrity is a mask,

1:14:11.352 --> 1:14:14.687
it fattens the ego, eats the
soul,

1:14:14.722 --> 1:14:18.993
until one day you wake up
and you can't take it off.

1:14:25.799 --> 1:14:27.801
Flex, you're never
gonna believe the shit

1:14:27.835 --> 1:14:29.870
I've just been through.

1:14:29.904 --> 1:14:32.306
It's like straight outta a
fuckin' movie.

1:14:32.339 --> 1:14:36.710
That's nice, why aren't you in
your tux?

1:14:36.744 --> 1:14:37.745
Tux?

1:14:39.046 --> 1:14:40.047
Do you have any idea
what I've been through

1:14:40.080 --> 1:14:42.349
the last two fucking months?

1:14:43.817 --> 1:14:45.019
I knew it wouldn't last,

1:14:45.052 --> 1:14:48.822
this is why I never go
to your wrap parties.

1:14:48.856 --> 1:14:52.226
What the fuck are you talking
about?

1:14:52.259 --> 1:14:55.930
Wrap party, fuck.

1:14:58.332 --> 1:15:00.067
I made "Beast Moon?"

1:15:04.271 --> 1:15:05.272
Am I dead?

1:15:08.943 --> 1:15:11.412
What the fuck is going on?

1:15:15.916 --> 1:15:19.119
The wrap party, it's
started.

1:15:19.153 --> 1:15:22.389
Oh no, grab the van, we're on
our way.

1:15:26.060 --> 1:15:27.261
Hey Muff, it's Hampton,

1:15:27.294 --> 1:15:29.496
listen I'm on my way to the
party now.

1:15:29.530 --> 1:15:33.901
I talked to Trammel,
he gave me an antidote,

1:15:33.934 --> 1:15:36.203
you're gonna think I'm crazy
but it's all gonna make sense.

1:15:42.209 --> 1:15:45.879
Hi, hi, yes, I have you guys
down.

1:15:45.913 --> 1:15:47.414
Have a good time, thank
you, don't say a word,

1:15:47.448 --> 1:15:48.482
where's Michael, stop talking.

1:15:48.515 --> 1:15:49.350
He's in there.

1:15:49.383 --> 1:15:50.417
You're still talking.

1:15:50.451 --> 1:15:52.253
But I need to talk to you!

1:15:52.286 --> 1:15:54.922
Breen, I love you dude.

1:15:54.955 --> 1:15:58.425
If this tape makes it out,
don't let anybody know

1:15:58.459 --> 1:16:02.329
that we used Michael and
traded him for Huckle.

1:16:02.363 --> 1:16:03.831
Breen, oi, oi.

1:16:07.001 --> 1:16:07.868
Oh Scram.

1:16:07.901 --> 1:16:09.470
I've been looking for you
sunshine.

1:16:09.503 --> 1:16:10.971
Seems like you've been dodging
me Breen.

1:16:11.005 --> 1:16:12.006
Look what are you talking
about?

1:16:12.039 --> 1:16:13.941
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

1:16:13.974 --> 1:16:15.976
We could have done a
lot of business together

1:16:16.010 --> 1:16:19.446
if you'd just been honest with
me.

1:16:19.480 --> 1:16:21.515
We weren't supposed to go to
the police

1:16:21.548 --> 1:16:23.851
and Breen told me not to say
anything

1:16:23.884 --> 1:16:25.452
and I'm living with the guilt

1:16:25.486 --> 1:16:29.123
and then I read "Crime and
Punishment" by Dostoyevsky

1:16:29.156 --> 1:16:31.959
and it made me feel worse.

1:16:31.992 --> 1:16:32.826
Look, I really don't know

1:16:32.860 --> 1:16:33.527
what you're talking about right
now

1:16:33.560 --> 1:16:34.895
but I'm looking for somebody.

1:16:34.928 --> 1:16:37.298
You are going to regret this.

1:16:37.331 --> 1:16:41.935
Scram, be nice, go and
get a drink, calm down.

1:16:41.969 --> 1:16:42.603
Here you are.

1:16:42.636 --> 1:16:44.338
Oh Mrs. Goldberg.

1:16:44.371 --> 1:16:46.006
Why so formal, call me Ali.

1:16:46.040 --> 1:16:50.444
Ali, I'm so sorry, I'm a
little preoccupied right now.

1:16:50.477 --> 1:16:53.347
Rushes they were so fantastic.

1:16:53.380 --> 1:16:55.582
Why don't we just go back
to our old arrangement?

1:16:55.616 --> 1:16:56.550
You know.

1:16:56.583 --> 1:16:58.619
Oh, oh, no, no, no, no, I
can't do that.

1:16:58.652 --> 1:17:02.056
I'm not that way anymore, I've
changed.

1:17:02.757 --> 1:17:05.192
Oh shit, it's gonna
be tight, Breen hold on.

1:17:07.127 --> 1:17:08.595
Oh shit, I'm sorry!

1:17:09.997 --> 1:17:12.933
I got you, you're good, go on
in.

1:17:14.535 --> 1:17:15.536
Oh shit.

1:17:17.204 --> 1:17:18.405
Hi.

1:17:18.439 --> 1:17:21.241
Fuck you, you fucking bitch.

1:17:21.275 --> 1:17:23.344
You think I don't remember what
happened?

1:17:23.377 --> 1:17:25.079
Where the fuck is Breen?

1:17:25.112 --> 1:17:26.513
I'm gonna fuckin' kill him!

1:17:26.547 --> 1:17:29.049
Oh, no, no, no, no, I don't
think.

1:17:29.083 --> 1:17:30.084
Oh my god.

1:17:39.293 --> 1:17:40.127
You rolling?

1:17:40.160 --> 1:17:41.662
Ready boss, roll.

1:17:41.695 --> 1:17:45.232
Now I reveal to the world on
camera,

1:17:45.265 --> 1:17:48.268
that Huckle Saxton is
an imposter and a liar

1:17:48.302 --> 1:17:51.038
and watch him run for the hills.

1:17:54.274 --> 1:17:55.409
Hey asshole.

1:17:59.046 --> 1:18:01.315
What the fuck is going on?

1:18:05.586 --> 1:18:08.122
Ain't nobody going nowhere.

1:18:11.726 --> 1:18:14.595
Stop it you
fool, you'll ruin everything.

1:18:14.628 --> 1:18:17.297
How about I ruin you, you fat
fuck?

1:18:22.970 --> 1:18:24.505
Who the fuck is who?

1:18:25.606 --> 1:18:30.911
Which one of you two lowlife
cocksuckers killed me brother?

1:18:32.679 --> 1:18:35.349
He's Huckle, I'm just some
homeless guy.

1:18:35.382 --> 1:18:38.952
I'm the imposter, they
turned me into Huckle.

1:18:38.986 --> 1:18:43.957
Drop your drawers, let's see
who's got the fuckin' tattoo.

1:18:50.732 --> 1:18:55.402
Ah fuck it, I'll kill all
of ya's, just in case.

1:19:00.374 --> 1:19:04.678
That is the best promotional
stunt I have ever seen.

1:19:04.712 --> 1:19:06.980
What the fuck is going on?

1:19:07.014 --> 1:19:09.082
Who the fuck are you man?

1:19:09.116 --> 1:19:12.453
I'm so sorry Flex, this is
what I was tryna tell you.

1:19:12.486 --> 1:19:13.420
You lied to me.

1:19:13.454 --> 1:19:17.024
Shut the fuck up bitch, men
are talking.

1:19:18.625 --> 1:19:23.597
Don't you ever talk to her
like that, I would die for her.

1:19:24.398 --> 1:19:26.333
You would die for me?

1:19:27.000 --> 1:19:31.706
I don't care about any of
this, the fame, the money,

1:19:31.739 --> 1:19:35.008
the bathing, you're all I care
about.

1:19:35.877 --> 1:19:37.444
You're the best thing
that ever happened to me

1:19:37.478 --> 1:19:39.346
and I'm so sorry Flex.

1:19:47.087 --> 1:19:50.157
What a minute, what time is it?

1:20:03.604 --> 1:20:07.574
I didn't change, I'm not
a monster, I'm Michael.

1:20:22.089 --> 1:20:23.090
Fuck this!

1:20:40.541 --> 1:20:45.279
Why don't you pick on
somebody your own size Scram?

1:20:49.550 --> 1:20:52.185
You better not say shit.

1:20:52.219 --> 1:20:52.887
No sir.

1:20:52.921 --> 1:20:54.187
Listen dipshits.

1:20:58.125 --> 1:21:01.194
Sarge it was Burt, he farted
Sarge.

1:21:01.228 --> 1:21:03.363
Monsters
are ripping people apart,

1:21:03.397 --> 1:21:05.332
get your asses there now.

1:21:05.365 --> 1:21:06.734
We're on the dog.

1:21:06.768 --> 1:21:10.304
Breen baby, hold that dick,
I'm coming!

1:21:35.863 --> 1:21:40.334
I should have saved this
one for the sequel Breen.

1:21:48.175 --> 1:21:51.578
Your bark is worse than your
bite Scram.

1:22:21.575 --> 1:22:24.779
You'll never work in this town
again.

1:22:37.391 --> 1:22:39.761
This one ends with a twist.

1:22:51.706 --> 1:22:56.643
That's the thing about Hollywood,
everyone has a big mouth.

1:23:23.838 --> 1:23:25.973
We're here, shit, Breen!

1:23:38.920 --> 1:23:41.388
Breen, you have to eat this.

1:23:42.724 --> 1:23:45.659
I need my producer credit, come
on.

1:23:47.594 --> 1:23:48.730
You all right?

1:23:51.531 --> 1:23:52.532
Breen?

1:23:58.505 --> 1:24:00.507
It's gonna be all right.

1:24:07.081 --> 1:24:08.315
Monster!

1:24:08.348 --> 1:24:10.584
No, he's gonna be okay.

1:24:47.587 --> 1:24:49.857
Guilty motherfucker.

1:25:30.097 --> 1:25:34.902
Hollywood, where dreams are
made and hearts are broken.

1:25:38.806 --> 1:25:39.807
Ain't that the truth.
