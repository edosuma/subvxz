00:28.929 --> 00:31.832
With Bell-end Socket Welds.

00:31.899 --> 00:33.267
On the outer farcs.

00:33.334 --> 00:35.836
Inside, I don't like them.

00:35.903 --> 00:37.171
What do you like inside?

00:37.238 --> 00:39.307
Dell Yard 50s

00:39.373 --> 00:41.742
because of thermal expansion
with nickel alloys.

00:41.809 --> 00:45.713
How many fillet welds would you
use in that scenario, John?

00:45.779 --> 00:48.116
I would use two.

00:52.486 --> 00:54.222
200?

00:55.623 --> 00:57.291
Yeah.

00:58.926 --> 01:01.262
Of course, man. I'm sorry.

01:01.329 --> 01:03.997
John, walk me through a scenario

01:04.132 --> 01:06.300
where you've contracted
for cap ends.

01:06.367 --> 01:08.602
You've got cracked L quadrants,

01:08.669 --> 01:11.139
and 40,000 gallons
coming down the line.

01:11.205 --> 01:13.607
What do you tell the engineer?

01:15.176 --> 01:16.976
He's going to have to
tie down his baker knots

01:17.010 --> 01:21.315
at every Lawrence crease
besides the first and last.

01:21.382 --> 01:24.318
Well, I hope he doesn't
tie down his bakers

01:24.385 --> 01:26.487
because then he'd open
his truss underbelly

01:26.554 --> 01:30.391
and crack every uncracked
quad in the line.

01:30.458 --> 01:31.458
Wow.

01:33.294 --> 01:35.196
Let's try that one again.

01:37.265 --> 01:38.966
Yeah, I don't know.
Great recommendations.

01:39.032 --> 01:42.002
His CV was strong, but I like
the little Asian guy better.

01:42.069 --> 01:43.571
This guy seems a little weird.

01:43.637 --> 01:45.639
Yeah, and he was
10 minutes late.

01:45.706 --> 01:48.642
That Stephen Tchoo
was right on time.

01:48.709 --> 01:51.179
That Stephen Tchoo.

01:54.448 --> 01:55.916
Hey.

01:55.983 --> 01:57.017
Hey.

01:57.084 --> 01:58.419
You just interviewed

01:58.486 --> 01:59.820
for the process engineering job?

01:59.887 --> 02:00.954
Yeah. You?

02:01.021 --> 02:02.790
Yeah. Yeah. How'd it go?

02:02.856 --> 02:04.057
Great. How about you?

02:04.192 --> 02:05.559
Okay.

02:05.626 --> 02:07.728
Not great. I blanked
on a couple of things,

02:07.795 --> 02:09.096
a couple of basics.

02:09.197 --> 02:11.198
Hey, it happens, man.
Don't beat yourself up.

02:11.199 --> 02:13.000
Yeah. So you think
you'll take it

02:13.066 --> 02:14.202
if they offer?

02:14.268 --> 02:16.337
What are you thinking?

02:16.404 --> 02:18.406
I have some other offers.

02:18.472 --> 02:20.874
But it's a pretty strong
opportunity here.

02:20.941 --> 02:22.310
So I'm pretty jacked.

02:22.376 --> 02:24.412
Yeah. Good for you.

02:24.478 --> 02:26.580
Hey, tomorrow's another day.

03:47.595 --> 03:49.930
A helicopter crash in rural Iran

03:49.997 --> 03:52.300
will drastically alter
their spring election.

03:52.333 --> 03:53.934
Frontrunner Fashid Harmed

03:54.001 --> 03:55.969
and three others died
this morning in Herat,

03:56.036 --> 03:58.472
leaving a field of two
remaining candidates,

03:58.539 --> 04:01.041
neither of whom were
once expected to win.

04:01.108 --> 04:03.744
Edward, could you cancel
your plans for this weekend?

04:03.811 --> 04:06.179
Something has happened,
and I'd like you to come over.

04:06.314 --> 04:09.182
Is this not an opportunity
to adopt a more moderate

04:09.317 --> 04:10.360
social and religious position?

04:10.384 --> 04:11.785
Mr. Harmed, a moderate,

04:11.852 --> 04:13.754
was expected
to win the election.

04:13.821 --> 04:18.125
My political positions
are functions of my faith.

04:18.190 --> 04:20.961
My faith won't move.

04:21.028 --> 04:24.097
If there's moving,
men will come to me.

04:24.164 --> 04:27.034
I would like
to send someone over

04:27.100 --> 04:29.036
to get in front
of this election.

04:29.102 --> 04:30.771
Who?

04:30.838 --> 04:33.574
We have few officers

04:33.641 --> 04:36.377
who've worked Iran
over any meaningful term.

04:36.444 --> 04:41.081
One has NOC. Time
in engineering covers.

04:41.148 --> 04:43.250
He'll have to go in
non-official.

04:43.351 --> 04:45.919
But there's a concern.

04:45.986 --> 04:47.354
Because?

04:47.355 --> 04:51.258
It's my son,
and it's complicated.

04:51.359 --> 04:52.926
In what way?

04:56.964 --> 04:58.366
Well, in one way,

04:58.399 --> 05:00.868
he records folk music
under an assumed name

05:00.934 --> 05:03.270
because he says it helps
him with his feelings,

05:03.371 --> 05:05.473
for example. That's one way.

05:05.539 --> 05:08.742
That's, um... Really?

05:08.809 --> 05:11.945
The songs, they're pretty good.

05:12.012 --> 05:14.081
Um, I mean, I'm his dad,
so maybe I'm biased,

05:14.147 --> 05:15.449
but they're pretty good,

05:15.516 --> 05:19.119
but they're becoming...
more honest.

05:19.186 --> 05:22.923
Which is probably a good thing
for folk singers in general

05:22.990 --> 05:24.392
but not a good thing

05:24.425 --> 05:27.461
if you're one who works
in intelligence.

05:27.528 --> 05:31.699
But he's suited for this job,
and he's excellent.

05:31.765 --> 05:32.900
He's just...

05:34.134 --> 05:35.268
I don't know,

05:35.403 --> 05:36.904
not like everybody else.

05:38.672 --> 05:40.841
And he's had a tough year,
and I'm worried about him.

05:42.410 --> 05:43.844
How close are they?

05:45.078 --> 05:46.279
To what?

05:46.414 --> 05:48.181
To a practical
nuclear capability?

05:48.248 --> 05:49.550
It's going to happen...

05:49.617 --> 05:52.019
This winter,
if they want it to happen.

07:58.445 --> 08:00.247
Hey, Efram,

08:00.313 --> 08:02.049
I got some news.

08:03.551 --> 08:05.085
Can you roll down
the window, buddy?

08:05.152 --> 08:06.152
Yeah.

08:10.457 --> 08:12.459
Thanks, man.

08:12.560 --> 08:14.327
You ready to camp, man?

08:14.394 --> 08:15.394
Yeah!

08:15.428 --> 08:16.964
Yeah, man. I was, too.

08:17.030 --> 08:18.566
But we can't.

08:19.667 --> 08:22.035
Yeah. I'm sorry.

08:22.102 --> 08:23.570
Something has come up.

08:23.571 --> 08:26.306
Your mom is away,

08:26.373 --> 08:27.653
and she was expecting you and me

08:27.708 --> 08:29.309
to hang for a couple of days,

08:29.376 --> 08:31.120
so I'm going to drive you
to your grandma's house.

08:31.144 --> 08:32.279
Cool?

08:32.345 --> 08:34.782
Hey, are you...

08:34.847 --> 08:38.085
You... are you getting crumbs
all over the place?

08:38.150 --> 08:39.620
No.

08:39.687 --> 08:41.020
Okay. Good.

08:43.056 --> 08:44.091
Good. Don't.

08:46.694 --> 08:48.596
Everything's all right.

08:48.662 --> 08:50.631
I'm sorry to come by
your work place like this,

08:50.698 --> 08:52.232
but it's important.

08:52.299 --> 08:53.500
Is John okay?

08:53.601 --> 08:55.235
He is. He is.

08:55.302 --> 08:56.369
Hi.

08:56.436 --> 08:57.771
Hi.

08:59.072 --> 09:00.850
But, Alice, I know you
were expecting John home

09:00.874 --> 09:02.776
at the end of the month.

09:02.843 --> 09:04.912
Are you sending him
somewhere else, Tom?

09:04.978 --> 09:06.814
He's not coming home, is he?

09:06.880 --> 09:10.651
He will be home
for a day or two,

09:10.718 --> 09:14.387
but then I'm sending him
back to work, yeah.

09:14.454 --> 09:15.923
But he's okay?

09:17.224 --> 09:19.292
His last job was involved.

09:21.695 --> 09:24.497
I know you were hoping
to have John home,

09:24.632 --> 09:27.935
and I know that,
the two of you had a...

09:29.102 --> 09:31.872
Well, a challenging year
last year.

09:31.939 --> 09:33.907
I should have come by
more often.

09:33.974 --> 09:36.343
I should have had you over
for a beer or something.

09:36.409 --> 09:38.646
So have me over next week.

09:41.248 --> 09:43.717
Is there anything
I can do for you two?

09:45.653 --> 09:46.887
You know what?

09:46.954 --> 09:48.756
I think we just need
a couple of days off.

09:48.822 --> 09:52.860
We just need to go
for a drive or something.

09:52.926 --> 09:55.663
I don't know.
Could it be that simple?

09:56.664 --> 09:58.465
I was married for 42 years,

09:58.531 --> 09:59.967
and yes, it can be that simple.

10:01.568 --> 10:03.771
But it's not going
to happen for a while.

10:06.039 --> 10:07.074
Okay.

10:09.576 --> 10:11.344
You take care of him.

10:11.411 --> 10:13.146
I plan to.

11:08.635 --> 11:10.037
Are you filming?

11:10.103 --> 11:12.372
Do you know how many
rules you're breaking?

11:12.439 --> 11:14.474
1, you're not supposed
to ride Bodacious.

11:14.541 --> 11:15.809
Just press "record."

11:15.876 --> 11:17.477
2, we're not supposed
to fuck around

11:17.544 --> 11:18.779
with Dad's camera.

11:19.880 --> 11:22.082
Hang on! Just hang on!

11:22.149 --> 11:24.084
John, get out of the chute!

11:24.151 --> 11:26.053
John, get out of the chute now!

11:28.388 --> 11:30.257
Let's go!

11:30.323 --> 11:31.992
You okay?

11:32.059 --> 11:34.862
Yeah. That thing's
fucked. I'm dead.

11:34.928 --> 11:37.064
- We'll tell him Memaw did it.
- Grandma?

11:40.868 --> 11:43.503
Thank you for clearing
the decks this weekend.

11:43.570 --> 11:44.972
Of course.

11:45.038 --> 11:47.174
Did you miss anything?

11:47.240 --> 11:52.412
Yeah. Beltway Buddies
events... camping.

11:52.479 --> 11:55.849
That's their project where
I foster and enrich a boy.

11:55.916 --> 11:57.417
Yeah, Eddie, I know.

11:58.685 --> 12:01.054
This is John's address.

12:02.255 --> 12:04.624
Get John. Tell him I need him.

12:04.691 --> 12:06.693
Come home.

12:06.794 --> 12:09.129
I'm worried about him.
He's been gone a while.

12:10.263 --> 12:12.465
Absolutely, I will get him home.

12:14.534 --> 12:15.936
Hey.

12:16.003 --> 12:17.437
I wanted to ask you.

12:17.504 --> 12:20.908
No reason. It just crosses
my mind from time to time.

12:20.974 --> 12:22.609
When you and John
were younger, Eddie...

12:22.675 --> 12:23.675
Yeah?

12:23.710 --> 12:25.445
I have always wondered.

12:25.512 --> 12:28.849
Did my 92-year-old mother

12:28.916 --> 12:30.951
really remove from its case

12:31.018 --> 12:33.987
and then just completely
fucking demolish

12:34.054 --> 12:36.423
my Sony VX3 video camera?

12:36.489 --> 12:37.690
Yes.

12:37.825 --> 12:39.059
And you're sure you and John

12:39.126 --> 12:40.693
weren't just
fucking around with it,

12:40.828 --> 12:41.828
doing something stupid?

12:41.829 --> 12:43.830
No. Memaw did it.

12:43.831 --> 12:45.365
She was country strong.

12:51.438 --> 12:53.540
Go bring your brother home.

12:53.606 --> 12:56.143
Take care of him if you need to.

12:57.510 --> 12:58.611
Will do.

12:58.678 --> 12:59.847
Okay.

13:11.558 --> 13:15.195
Hey, brother, you want
to go for a walk?

13:21.869 --> 13:24.304
She was their nanny.

13:24.371 --> 13:25.873
Did they like her?

13:25.906 --> 13:27.474
Not at first.

13:27.540 --> 13:29.276
But soon,

13:29.342 --> 13:31.378
soon they learned
that she could do

13:31.444 --> 13:33.613
some very fun
and interesting things.

13:33.680 --> 13:35.715
Like what?

13:35.782 --> 13:38.085
Like fly with her umbrella.

13:38.151 --> 13:40.720
They lived in London,

13:40.787 --> 13:44.291
which is a very
big city in England.

14:15.923 --> 14:17.457
He jumped off the fucking roof

14:17.524 --> 14:18.926
with a fucking umbrella!

14:18.959 --> 14:20.660
He broke his feet, Edward!

14:20.727 --> 14:22.629
- Both fucking feet!
- All right.

14:22.695 --> 14:23.930
And his ankles!

14:23.931 --> 14:25.065
He's supposed to be camping!

14:25.132 --> 14:26.399
- All right.
- With you!

14:26.466 --> 14:28.535
You just left him
with his grandmother?

14:28.601 --> 14:30.403
I can't believe
you're a Congressman!

14:30.470 --> 14:32.405
- That's scary!
- All right.

14:32.472 --> 14:33.983
- Now you just get back here!
- All right, I will come.

14:34.007 --> 14:35.675
I don't care where
the fuck you are!

14:35.742 --> 14:37.022
I said I would come home, Carol.

14:37.077 --> 14:38.946
I'm coming right now. Jeez.

14:39.947 --> 14:41.314
I have to go.

14:41.381 --> 14:43.984
My Little Buddy broke
his feet and his ankles.

14:44.051 --> 14:46.419
That was his mom.
My little special friend?

14:46.486 --> 14:49.556
Anyway, Dad needs you
home tonight.

14:49.622 --> 14:51.424
You got the message.

14:52.825 --> 14:54.827
I don't know.

14:54.962 --> 14:56.964
What don't you know?

14:56.997 --> 14:59.032
I'm competing tonight.

15:00.233 --> 15:02.302
You're competing. I'm sorry.

15:02.369 --> 15:03.636
In what?

15:03.703 --> 15:05.772
Mechanical bull contest.

15:05.838 --> 15:08.175
It's how I've been
making extra money.

15:08.241 --> 15:10.777
I'm saving up for a bike trip,

15:10.843 --> 15:12.679
a long trip.

15:12.745 --> 15:15.982
They're really big
out here, for some reason,

15:15.983 --> 15:17.084
mechanical bulls.

15:17.150 --> 15:19.052
5,000 bucks if I win.

15:19.119 --> 15:21.754
Listen, brother,

15:21.821 --> 15:23.523
it's going to be
different this time.

15:23.590 --> 15:26.659
All you got to do
is bring a bag of money,

15:26.726 --> 15:27.894
A to B, John,

15:27.995 --> 15:30.197
and then make sure
it gets doled out right

15:30.263 --> 15:32.999
over a few months. That's it.

15:33.000 --> 15:35.002
It's never easy like that.

15:35.035 --> 15:37.004
It always gets messed up.

15:37.070 --> 15:39.006
Okay, Dad says he needs you.

15:39.039 --> 15:40.740
That's pretty easy
to understand, right?

15:40.807 --> 15:42.309
Yeah...

15:42.375 --> 15:44.744
I'm leaning toward
just staying here,

15:44.811 --> 15:46.579
ride this fake bull,

15:46.646 --> 15:48.615
get that money,

15:48.681 --> 15:50.817
and then have Alice come out

15:50.883 --> 15:53.020
and bike across Spain with me.

15:53.086 --> 15:56.056
We'll look at some
Spanish birds.

15:56.123 --> 15:58.858
Spanish birds.

16:00.060 --> 16:01.894
You're so weird.

16:02.029 --> 16:04.631
Cantar Walley's
a terrorist, right?

16:04.697 --> 16:06.866
And he might be the next
President of Iran.

16:06.933 --> 16:10.337
And Dad said that he wouldn't
call you if he didn't need you.

16:12.339 --> 16:15.608
Well, this one tonight...
Bull ride...

16:15.675 --> 16:18.278
It's the final, so...

16:18.345 --> 16:20.047
there won't be
another money ride

16:20.113 --> 16:22.482
for six months.

16:22.549 --> 16:23.383
So I don't know.

16:23.450 --> 16:25.885
Maybe... Maybe I'll go back

16:25.952 --> 16:28.255
if I lose tonight.

16:28.321 --> 16:31.791
Who... Who do you even
compete against anyway?

16:31.858 --> 16:33.226
It's a pretty
international city.

16:33.293 --> 16:35.462
There's guys from all over.

16:35.528 --> 16:37.264
Are any of these
other competitors

16:37.330 --> 16:38.931
from Texas, like you?

16:39.066 --> 16:40.200
No.

16:40.267 --> 16:42.102
So you usually win.

16:43.336 --> 16:44.336
Yeah.

16:46.073 --> 16:47.507
What time is this thing?

16:47.574 --> 16:50.143
And are there any hot
European girls there usually?

16:50.210 --> 16:53.080
Because I can maybe squeeze
that in before my flight.

16:54.081 --> 16:57.950
From the United Kingdom,
Tony Splinters!

17:43.163 --> 17:44.497
From the United States
of America,

17:44.564 --> 17:47.567
from the state of Texas, John...

18:48.928 --> 18:49.929
Aah!

18:49.996 --> 18:52.732
I'm sorry.

18:52.799 --> 18:53.800
John.

18:53.866 --> 18:56.703
I should have called or...

19:06.979 --> 19:10.116
God, this is fucking...

19:10.217 --> 19:11.884
You're so beautiful.

19:11.951 --> 19:14.254
It's just not a great, um,

19:14.321 --> 19:15.655
accompanying...

19:15.722 --> 19:20.727
Yeah. Yeah, it is way
too chipper and wholesome.

19:20.793 --> 19:23.062
I'm just going to try
and work through this.

19:23.129 --> 19:24.331
Okay, honey.

19:27.967 --> 19:33.406
I'm struggling to stay
sexy for you here.

19:33.473 --> 19:35.308
- It's not sexy.
- No.

19:35.375 --> 19:36.843
But not you, not you.

19:36.909 --> 19:40.313
You are so sexy, but it's
just that fucking jingle.

19:41.648 --> 19:43.916
Parking, like, right out front.

19:43.983 --> 19:45.518
Fuck.

19:45.585 --> 19:48.388
Come on, guys,
what are you doing?

19:48.455 --> 19:51.057
- It's been three months.
- Yeah.

19:51.123 --> 19:53.260
I'm just going to...

19:53.293 --> 19:54.903
I'm just going to try
and work through it.

19:54.927 --> 19:56.128
Yeah.

19:56.263 --> 19:58.431
Hey, John... Lord! I'm sorry!

19:58.498 --> 20:00.333
I'm sorry! The door was open!

20:00.400 --> 20:02.602
I didn't see anything, okay?

20:05.438 --> 20:08.241
I will... I will meet you
downstairs, okay?

20:08.308 --> 20:10.777
I saw nothing.

20:13.746 --> 20:14.814
A little bit.

20:17.817 --> 20:20.253
The report says
he's lacking one thing:

20:20.320 --> 20:22.522
Short range weapons.

20:22.589 --> 20:25.692
Iran's program
is three months away.

20:25.758 --> 20:27.760
Their program is dormant now,

20:27.827 --> 20:29.662
and this guy wants
to keep it that way.

20:29.729 --> 20:32.765
This guy does not.
He wants to wake it up.

20:35.368 --> 20:37.804
That's probably his son, right?

20:40.840 --> 20:43.376
Nice. Make a whole 360,
you know?

20:47.013 --> 20:49.215
We're going to try to buy
this election, John,

20:49.282 --> 20:50.617
for the other guy.

20:50.683 --> 20:51.860
We're going to spread
a lot of money

20:51.884 --> 20:54.120
all across Iran,
across all 30 provinces.

20:54.186 --> 20:55.422
We got the guy to do that.

20:55.488 --> 20:57.056
We just need you
to get him the money

20:57.123 --> 20:58.925
and then come and go
from Iran in the fall

20:58.991 --> 21:01.561
to make sure that it
gets to where we need it.

21:01.628 --> 21:02.995
How?

21:06.633 --> 21:08.635
I thought you were looking.

21:10.236 --> 21:12.004
You looked
like you were looking.

21:12.071 --> 21:15.742
McMillan is an oil
infrastructure engineering firm.

21:15.808 --> 21:18.244
This project's gonna
play out in two places:

21:18.345 --> 21:19.846
Iran and Luxembourg.

21:19.912 --> 21:22.148
We need to bank with
these people in Luxembourg

21:22.214 --> 21:23.583
because their money
is worthless,

21:23.650 --> 21:27.086
and the Iranians we need
don't use their own banks.

21:27.153 --> 21:29.722
McMillan comes and goes
both places.

21:29.789 --> 21:31.658
Hey, John.

21:33.926 --> 21:35.161
Yeah.

21:35.227 --> 21:36.596
Are you getting any of this?

21:38.230 --> 21:40.366
I'm getting all of it.

21:40.367 --> 21:43.703
Money, Luxembourg, Iran.

21:43.770 --> 21:45.004
Buy an election.

21:46.506 --> 21:47.807
Yeah, that's all.

21:48.975 --> 21:50.577
Luxembourg's
the only country in Europe

21:50.643 --> 21:52.278
that does business with Iran,

21:52.379 --> 21:55.582
so all the money comes
and goes through there.

21:56.716 --> 22:00.487
McMillan travels
both places routinely,

22:00.553 --> 22:01.754
so that's your mark.

22:01.821 --> 22:04.557
You interview in Milwaukee
on Wednesday.

22:04.624 --> 22:06.693
The physicist guy
wants 10 million.

22:06.759 --> 22:08.203
It's been difficult
to pay him, though,

22:08.227 --> 22:09.662
because of the sanctions.

22:09.729 --> 22:11.474
But they're going to find
a way to pay him right quick

22:11.498 --> 22:12.699
if Walley wins.

22:12.765 --> 22:15.635
And as soon as it's
in his bank account,

22:15.702 --> 22:17.404
he'll do whatever
he needs to do,

22:17.470 --> 22:19.406
and then there they go.

22:22.008 --> 22:23.410
Are you good?

22:24.977 --> 22:27.580
I am. Yeah.

22:29.015 --> 22:30.583
All right. Good.

22:30.650 --> 22:32.619
It's nice to see you.

22:40.960 --> 22:42.028
All right.

24:12.619 --> 24:15.187
You mentioned there were
a few other things.

24:15.254 --> 24:16.756
Yes.

24:16.823 --> 24:18.524
How was your interview?

24:18.525 --> 24:19.959
- Fine.
- Good.

24:20.026 --> 24:21.060
Thanks.

24:21.127 --> 24:23.195
I just need you

24:23.262 --> 24:25.064
to fill out this W-9.

24:29.101 --> 24:31.704
That's Jack Birdbath.
He used to be a cop,

24:31.771 --> 24:33.411
and then he shot
a 9-year-old Puerto Rican

24:33.439 --> 24:34.941
in the back.

24:35.007 --> 24:37.309
Yeah, so...

24:37.376 --> 24:38.845
he's disgraced.

24:38.911 --> 24:39.979
Yeah.

24:42.549 --> 24:43.816
And do this.

24:47.854 --> 24:49.956
There's a men's room
just up on 3.

25:22.589 --> 25:23.890
Hey.

25:23.956 --> 25:25.124
Hey.

25:25.191 --> 25:27.694
I'm John Lakeman.

25:27.760 --> 25:30.196
Just interviewed
in process engineering.

25:30.262 --> 25:33.165
Cool. Hey, Dennis
McClaren, conforming.

25:33.232 --> 25:34.266
Cool.

25:35.935 --> 25:38.638
Can I talk to you
about something?

25:38.705 --> 25:40.439
Listen, I'm in a situation.

25:40.506 --> 25:42.609
Hey, can you not pee for a sec?

25:42.675 --> 25:45.011
Can I not what?

25:45.077 --> 25:46.112
Don't pee.

25:53.119 --> 25:53.986
My name's John,

25:54.053 --> 25:55.487
but my last name's not Lakeman.

25:55.622 --> 25:58.024
I am interviewing for a position

25:58.090 --> 25:59.458
in process design,

25:59.525 --> 26:01.994
but I'm also
an intelligence officer.

26:02.061 --> 26:04.731
Don't pee, please.
Are you peeing, Dennis?

26:06.032 --> 26:06.799
No.

26:06.866 --> 26:08.300
I need this job

26:08.367 --> 26:09.636
because I have to work

26:09.669 --> 26:11.738
in accredited
construction overseas

26:11.804 --> 26:15.407
to go places Americans
aren't supposed to.

26:15.474 --> 26:16.843
Okay.

26:16.909 --> 26:18.410
Without leaving a trail.

26:18.477 --> 26:19.645
Okay.

26:19.646 --> 26:20.980
Luxembourg.

26:21.047 --> 26:22.114
Yeah.

26:22.181 --> 26:23.249
Iran.

26:23.315 --> 26:24.516
Yeah, we go there.

26:24.651 --> 26:25.828
Yeah, I know.
That's why I'm here.

26:25.852 --> 26:27.262
I have to hand over
some money in Luxembourg

26:27.286 --> 26:28.554
and then be in Iran.

26:28.655 --> 26:29.922
I can hear you peeing, man.

26:29.989 --> 26:31.824
I'm sorry, man.
That's because I started

26:31.891 --> 26:34.293
a little before,
and it's hard to stop.

26:34.360 --> 26:36.428
If you could...

26:36.495 --> 26:38.898
Maybe hurry it up or make it
shorter or something.

26:38.965 --> 26:40.900
I have to oversee
the distribution

26:40.967 --> 26:42.735
of hard money across Iran,

26:42.802 --> 26:46.372
just to stop Israel from
being fucked up, basically.

26:46.438 --> 26:49.008
McMillan's the only company
that banks where they bank,

26:49.075 --> 26:51.077
that works on the ground
in Iran.

26:51.143 --> 26:55.181
I'm not going to pass
this urine test,

26:55.247 --> 26:56.348
so I need yours.

26:58.117 --> 26:59.285
It's not just me.

26:59.351 --> 27:01.888
The country.

27:01.954 --> 27:03.723
The USA.

27:05.257 --> 27:07.927
The USA needs my pee?

27:07.994 --> 27:10.296
Yeah. I know it's weird,

27:10.362 --> 27:11.831
but, okay,

27:11.898 --> 27:15.467
so will you pee
in my cup, Dennis,

27:15.534 --> 27:18.170
and then not tell anybody ever?

27:21.607 --> 27:24.343
Okay, w-why don't you hold it?

27:45.397 --> 27:47.733
I dropped my night stick.

27:47.734 --> 27:49.268
Okay.

27:51.738 --> 27:54.273
While I was taking a shit.

27:54.340 --> 27:55.875
Okay.

27:57.744 --> 27:59.746
Okay.

27:59.779 --> 28:01.380
See you.

28:09.021 --> 28:12.224
You're meeting with Tim Peetnam.

28:12.291 --> 28:15.127
He chairs the Foreign
Relations Subcommittee

28:15.194 --> 28:17.897
on Terrorism,
Nonproliferation, and Trade.

28:17.964 --> 28:19.665
He's going to ask you on.

28:19.766 --> 28:21.834
I asked him to.

28:21.901 --> 28:24.503
I need you to be near John
when he's in Iran

28:24.570 --> 28:28.775
and in Luxembourg,
I guess, for now.

28:28.841 --> 28:30.176
Okay.

28:30.242 --> 28:33.579
You'll be able to come and go
on that committee

28:33.645 --> 28:35.114
as an attaché.

28:38.150 --> 28:40.219
Attaché?

28:44.791 --> 28:48.427
You know, your dad and I
came up together in Congress.

28:48.494 --> 28:50.129
When he moved to state,

28:50.196 --> 28:52.631
I was pleased
you ran for his seat.

28:52.698 --> 28:55.067
It was an honor.

28:55.134 --> 28:58.905
I'd be glad to have you
on the subcommittee.

28:58.971 --> 29:02.308
I was hoping you'd take
an attaché role

29:02.374 --> 29:03.843
in Nonproliferation.

29:05.444 --> 29:06.979
With pleasure.

29:07.046 --> 29:09.115
I'm looking forward
to making a difference

29:09.181 --> 29:12.151
on that front as an attaché.

29:12.218 --> 29:15.922
I served with your dad...
Army Infantry 52...

29:15.988 --> 29:17.857
- As well...
- Do I get a badge?

29:17.924 --> 29:19.458
Get a what?

29:19.525 --> 29:21.293
Do I get an attaché badge?

29:22.494 --> 29:23.595
I don't know.

29:23.662 --> 29:25.297
I don't think we have those.

29:25.364 --> 29:26.565
Right.

29:26.632 --> 29:28.367
What if I made my own?

29:30.402 --> 29:32.071
Well, it would be weird,

29:32.138 --> 29:34.540
but I guess you could.

29:34.606 --> 29:35.842
I don't know.

29:37.109 --> 29:39.846
Do you know where we're
flying out of?

29:39.912 --> 29:41.552
Did you know the 500 euro
is the preferred

29:41.613 --> 29:42.982
currency of the underworld?

29:43.049 --> 29:45.852
You want to draw
the blinds there, buddy?

29:45.918 --> 29:47.453
I asked you a question.

29:47.519 --> 29:49.431
I asked you if you know
where we're flying out of.

29:49.455 --> 29:51.523
You are flying
out of Terminal 6B,

29:51.590 --> 29:53.292
corporate terminal,
at Milwaukee Airport.

29:53.359 --> 29:55.261
- Private terminal?
- Yep. There's no screener.

29:55.327 --> 29:56.662
You just get on.

29:56.728 --> 29:58.197
You're certain?

29:58.264 --> 30:01.133
Because if I have to
check it for some reason...

30:01.200 --> 30:03.702
They do random screens
of bags at intervals,

30:03.769 --> 30:05.471
so someone could see
into this bag

30:05.537 --> 30:06.939
on the other side,

30:07.006 --> 30:08.807
even if I check it.

30:08.875 --> 30:11.277
That could happen
if I let it out of my hands,

30:11.343 --> 30:13.212
and there's a lot of money
in this bag.

30:14.580 --> 30:16.883
You carry it with you
on the plane, John.

30:16.949 --> 30:18.660
Look, you're not going
to have any problems.

30:18.684 --> 30:21.420
We cased the corporate
logs for 36 months.

30:21.487 --> 30:23.022
You're flying private.

30:23.089 --> 30:25.224
And your father
told me to tell you

30:25.291 --> 30:26.125
keep it safe.

30:26.192 --> 30:27.393
We can't just send more bags.

30:27.459 --> 30:28.928
It's not the 1980s.

30:28.995 --> 30:31.230
This bag has to get
where it's going.

30:36.468 --> 30:38.404
What's the latest
with the Asian kid?

30:38.470 --> 30:41.073
I went to see him
on behalf of McMillan.

30:41.140 --> 30:44.476
He's suffering from
closed head trauma.

30:44.543 --> 30:46.145
Struggling to form words.

30:46.212 --> 30:49.581
And he's permanently lost
his sense of humor.

30:49.648 --> 30:52.384
All in all, he's
looking pretty normal.

30:52.451 --> 30:53.752
But he's not normal.

30:53.819 --> 30:56.889
No. He got hit
by a fucking truck.

30:56.956 --> 30:57.957
He talks like he's 6.

30:58.024 --> 30:59.825
But he's fighting it.

30:59.892 --> 31:01.693
Should have looked both ways.

31:01.760 --> 31:04.763
Hey, Leslie, we flying Delta?

31:04.830 --> 31:06.198
No. United.

31:06.265 --> 31:08.367
God damn it.

31:08.434 --> 31:10.036
What?

31:10.102 --> 31:11.437
We talked about that, Leslie.

31:11.503 --> 31:14.974
I said Delta from now on
whenever possible.

31:15.041 --> 31:16.518
They have more attractive
stewardesses.

31:16.542 --> 31:20.646
Aren't we leaving
from the private terminal?

31:20.712 --> 31:22.414
No.

31:22.481 --> 31:24.683
We only fly private
when there are multiple legs.

31:24.750 --> 31:26.952
That's regular company policy.

31:26.953 --> 31:29.188
Straight shots,
we fly commercial.

31:30.822 --> 31:33.292
What, commercial's not
good enough for you, Lakeman?

31:33.359 --> 31:35.461
Of course.

31:35.527 --> 31:36.963
Yeah.

31:43.035 --> 31:45.237
Any time you're ready,
there, Lakeman.

31:46.505 --> 31:48.640
I'm going to have
to check this bag.

31:48.707 --> 31:50.209
It's getting a little heavy.

31:52.044 --> 31:53.479
I'll be right with you.

33:57.369 --> 33:58.804
The only name here that matches

33:58.870 --> 34:00.482
the first two numbers
of the scooter plate

34:00.506 --> 34:04.176
is E. Barros, Edgar Barros.

34:04.243 --> 34:06.145
- Do you have a pen?
- Yeah. Can you tell me

34:06.212 --> 34:08.013
if there's an alarm
at the address?

34:08.114 --> 34:09.581
There's no crime there, right?

34:09.648 --> 34:11.250
He probably won't have an alarm.

34:11.317 --> 34:12.717
Guy's front door
might even be open.

34:12.784 --> 34:14.353
He has five brothers,
by the way.

34:14.420 --> 34:15.786
I don't need his biography.

34:15.853 --> 34:17.123
I just need the address, Ron.

34:17.156 --> 34:18.623
They all live
at that address, John.

34:18.690 --> 34:20.359
I thought you might want to know

34:20.426 --> 34:22.128
there could be six men
in the house.

34:22.194 --> 34:23.605
They're Brazilian.
Brazilians constitute

34:23.629 --> 34:25.164
most of the labor force
in Luxembourg.

34:25.231 --> 34:26.931
Can I have that address, Ron?

34:26.998 --> 34:29.501
Lots of Brazilian guys
know jiu-jitsu and shit.

34:29.568 --> 34:31.270
That's not just a fun fact.

34:31.337 --> 34:33.339
I'm trying to give you
your reconnaissance.

34:33.405 --> 34:35.474
Address 77 de Champlain.

34:35.541 --> 34:37.309
- Hey, John.
- Hang on.

34:41.679 --> 34:44.616
- Hey, man.
- I said hang on.

34:44.683 --> 34:49.154
I thought you said come in.

34:49.155 --> 34:51.257
Nice room.

34:51.322 --> 34:52.634
Hey, I'm staying
just down the hall.

34:52.658 --> 34:53.992
Theodore III.

34:54.059 --> 34:56.895
So what's up?

34:56.962 --> 35:00.166
- Nothing much.
- Cool.

35:00.199 --> 35:03.535
Just in my room
doing piping B.S.

35:05.171 --> 35:08.440
So... what's up? What do you...

35:08.507 --> 35:10.942
Hey, are you doing
some cool shit?

35:11.009 --> 35:13.412
Am I what?

35:13.479 --> 35:16.282
Cool intelligence...

35:16.348 --> 35:17.683
stuff while you're here?

35:17.749 --> 35:19.285
Because I can help.

35:19.351 --> 35:20.719
I was in ROTC.

35:20.786 --> 35:22.788
I just wanted you to know that.

35:22.854 --> 35:27.226
Dennis, I just look
at numbers sometimes.

35:27.293 --> 35:28.594
It's like accounting.

35:28.660 --> 35:30.762
John, I know
you can't really tell

35:30.829 --> 35:33.031
because I have to wear
a suit all the time,

35:33.098 --> 35:34.433
but I'm ripped.

35:34.500 --> 35:36.468
Maybe I can be a big help.

35:36.535 --> 35:38.470
That's all.

36:10.569 --> 36:12.871
That's so you know
I'm not full of shit.

36:17.243 --> 36:18.544
I know it's kind of last minute,

36:18.610 --> 36:21.247
but do you have
any Japanese girls?

36:21.313 --> 36:25.083
Great. Just maybe to
accompany me to dinner.

36:25.150 --> 36:26.618
Okay. Great.

36:26.685 --> 36:28.920
Or maybe to whip
the back of my legs

36:28.987 --> 36:30.722
with a Twizzler.

36:34.793 --> 36:36.094
Dennis.

36:36.161 --> 36:37.829
Hey, John.

36:37.896 --> 36:39.331
I'm just going for a walk

36:39.398 --> 36:42.368
to get my head together
for this meeting tonight.

36:42.434 --> 36:45.671
Go away, man. You did your part.

36:45.737 --> 36:47.105
I peed in a cup.

36:47.172 --> 36:49.007
Great job, man. It's good work.

36:49.074 --> 36:50.576
Really helped me out,
but right now

36:50.642 --> 36:52.778
you're really kind of
fucking me up here.

36:52.844 --> 36:54.413
I like you, but go away.

36:54.480 --> 36:57.649
Okay? I like you, but seriously,

36:57.716 --> 36:58.884
go away now.

37:00.886 --> 37:02.087
John.

37:02.288 --> 37:04.656
I got two kids. They're okay.

37:04.723 --> 37:06.858
Yeah, they're okay, but man,

37:06.925 --> 37:08.894
my wife and my job...

37:08.960 --> 37:10.596
Come on. That's it.

37:10.662 --> 37:12.531
That's my whole life? Piping?

37:12.598 --> 37:13.832
Let me do some recon.

37:13.899 --> 37:15.401
- Recon?
- Yeah.

37:15.467 --> 37:17.436
Dennis, if you keep
following me,

37:17.503 --> 37:19.304
I'm going to stab you
in the thigh.

37:19.305 --> 37:21.306
John, I can be a huge help...

37:21.307 --> 37:22.774
Don't go to the hospital.

37:22.841 --> 37:24.743
Fuck!

37:24.810 --> 37:26.111
What?

37:26.177 --> 37:27.679
You stabbed me in the fucking...

37:27.746 --> 37:30.315
Prohibit me from going
to the hospital?

37:30.316 --> 37:31.817
What am I supposed to do?

37:31.883 --> 37:34.986
You're a jerk, man. Fuck.

37:59.345 --> 38:03.715
Goal!

38:03.782 --> 38:05.717
Goal!

39:57.663 --> 39:59.464
I can wait only 20 more minutes.

39:59.465 --> 40:01.933
Thank you, Maurice.

40:02.000 --> 40:04.069
I... I'm so sorry.

40:04.135 --> 40:05.537
He's a new guy.

40:05.604 --> 40:07.138
I don't know
where the hell he is.

40:07.205 --> 40:08.674
We said 9:30.

40:08.740 --> 40:10.175
Hey.

40:12.478 --> 40:13.679
Something happened.

40:13.745 --> 40:15.814
I can't walk around here.

40:15.881 --> 40:17.816
All right. Stay there.

40:17.883 --> 40:19.685
We'll get someone over there.

40:19.751 --> 40:21.787
Give me an address.

40:26.224 --> 40:27.559
Hello.

40:28.860 --> 40:29.861
Hey.

40:29.928 --> 40:32.297
John?

40:32.363 --> 40:34.399
Yeah. Hi.

40:34.466 --> 40:36.702
Hi. Are you okay?

40:36.768 --> 40:40.005
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

40:41.540 --> 40:43.308
I'm pretty far away.

40:43.374 --> 40:45.443
You sound so close.

40:47.879 --> 40:50.582
Have you been turning
the alarm on at night?

40:50.649 --> 40:53.118
Have I been turning
the alarm on?

40:53.184 --> 40:56.121
Yeah. When I walked in
on Monday morning,

40:56.187 --> 40:57.489
the alarm wasn't on.

40:57.556 --> 40:58.824
No.

40:58.890 --> 41:00.458
I don't like alarms, John.

41:00.526 --> 41:02.360
They scare me.
They're so loud and...

41:02.528 --> 41:04.530
Alice, they're supposed to be.

41:04.563 --> 41:06.097
That's why you're calling me?

41:06.164 --> 41:07.265
The alarm?

41:07.332 --> 41:09.167
Yeah. It's important.

41:09.234 --> 41:11.036
Promise me.

41:11.102 --> 41:12.103
All right.

41:12.170 --> 41:13.338
Promise me.

41:13.404 --> 41:14.606
Yeah, I promise you

41:14.673 --> 41:16.041
I will think about turning...

41:16.107 --> 41:17.375
Just turn it on.

41:18.744 --> 41:20.311
Okay. I got to go.

41:20.378 --> 41:22.180
Alarm. Bye.

41:22.247 --> 41:24.315
Good evening. Hi.

41:24.382 --> 41:26.351
Hi. I was hoping
you could help me.

41:26.417 --> 41:27.653
What can I do for you?

41:27.719 --> 41:29.320
I'm an attaché, by the way.

41:29.387 --> 41:30.789
Here's my attaché badge.

41:30.856 --> 41:32.858
Yeah, someone just,
I mean, really fucked up.

41:32.924 --> 41:34.459
Someone just bumped into me

41:34.560 --> 41:36.227
and took off with my briefcase

41:36.294 --> 41:37.729
with all my attaché shit in it,

41:37.796 --> 41:39.998
like, about a block east.

41:40.065 --> 41:42.233
I really need that stuff
as an attaché.

41:42.300 --> 41:43.434
On Bonnevoire Street?

41:43.569 --> 41:45.136
- Yeah.
- Okay.

41:45.203 --> 41:46.337
Exactly two minutes ago.

41:46.404 --> 41:48.106
Go fuck them up. Go get them.

41:49.307 --> 41:50.307
Thank you.

41:56.848 --> 41:58.483
- Hey, man.
- Hi.

41:58.584 --> 42:00.018
There's a clean shirt in here.

42:02.120 --> 42:03.622
Jesus.

42:09.895 --> 42:11.496
Got your little suit, guy?

42:11.597 --> 42:13.298
You're 40 minutes late.

42:13.364 --> 42:14.766
There was something I...

42:14.833 --> 42:16.602
You were supposed to go over

42:16.668 --> 42:19.104
our entire shipping order
tonight, okay?

42:19.170 --> 42:20.438
With Dennen.

42:20.505 --> 42:23.141
It ships tomorrow,
for Christ's sake.

42:24.610 --> 42:26.344
You're off to a shitty
start here, son,

42:26.411 --> 42:28.113
I don't mind saying.

42:28.179 --> 42:29.247
It won't happen again.

42:29.314 --> 42:30.916
That's not the McMillan way.

42:57.342 --> 43:00.545
Thanks for having me
at Open Mic Night.

43:00.646 --> 43:03.114
I hope that's
what the sign says.

43:03.181 --> 43:05.984
Any requests?

43:08.019 --> 43:10.656
Okay, I'll just...
I'll just play something

43:10.689 --> 43:15.393
I've been working on
tonight in my head.

44:26.832 --> 44:30.101
Thank you. Good night.

44:31.302 --> 44:32.503
Yeah.

44:32.570 --> 44:34.973
Yeah, that's cool, man.

44:35.040 --> 44:36.975
Yeah.

44:37.042 --> 44:39.745
They make us carry
those at all times.

44:43.381 --> 44:45.984
West Noble 990.

44:46.051 --> 44:49.554
When I got to Milwaukee,
when I interviewed,

44:49.620 --> 44:51.522
the Bureau report said

44:51.589 --> 44:55.226
the office was
at 990 West Noble.

44:55.293 --> 44:57.796
It's East Noble.

44:57.863 --> 45:00.531
And my... my cover
car never came.

45:00.598 --> 45:03.201
I had to run. I was late.

45:03.268 --> 45:04.903
I nearly lost the job,

45:04.970 --> 45:08.273
and then it just... it got
more fucked from there.

45:12.543 --> 45:13.779
Hey.

45:15.146 --> 45:17.849
I know you're not doing great,

45:17.916 --> 45:20.952
but you're going to be okay.

45:21.019 --> 45:24.956
I'm here. I'm always
going to be here.

45:26.324 --> 45:27.325
Okay?

45:30.695 --> 45:32.163
There's your badge.

45:33.799 --> 45:34.933
Thank you.

46:31.722 --> 46:33.358
Monsieur Lakeman,

46:33.424 --> 46:36.594
someone left a note this morning

46:36.661 --> 46:38.096
for you.

46:46.004 --> 46:48.673
Yeah. It's Portuguese.

46:48.739 --> 46:51.276
The note says "The cost
of not killing you, Lakeman",

46:51.342 --> 46:53.912
"or talking to the police
about you, Lakeman,

46:53.979 --> 46:56.581
is the garment bag,
the Barros Brothers."

46:56.647 --> 47:00.418
Okay, the bag transfer's
in 20 minutes, John.

47:00.485 --> 47:02.921
Only English, okay?

47:02.988 --> 47:05.356
Because I'm going to America.

47:05.423 --> 47:07.392
What's America?

47:07.458 --> 47:09.694
Another country.

47:09.760 --> 47:12.130
Like Luxembourg?

47:12.197 --> 47:15.700
No. Luxembourg
would fit in her pocket.

47:15.766 --> 47:18.469
It would get lost in her purse.

47:18.536 --> 47:20.638
Why are you going?

47:20.705 --> 47:22.540
My work.

47:22.607 --> 47:24.242
What do you do at work?

47:27.412 --> 47:31.316
Sometimes,
when we make pastries,

47:31.382 --> 47:34.485
you take your sister's from her

47:34.552 --> 47:37.522
when you think she's not
watching, Myna.

47:37.588 --> 47:39.024
She gets mad.

47:39.090 --> 47:41.126
Oui. She gets mad

47:41.192 --> 47:43.294
because it's not nice.

47:45.530 --> 47:49.467
Well, sometimes...

47:49.534 --> 47:53.604
a person will take
another person's life.

47:53.671 --> 47:56.841
Their whole life?

47:56.942 --> 47:59.978
Yes.

48:00.045 --> 48:02.747
They take their whole life.

48:02.948 --> 48:05.816
So I'm flying to America,

48:05.951 --> 48:08.286
to Milwaukee, America,

48:08.353 --> 48:12.523
to learn who took someone
else's whole life.

48:20.598 --> 48:21.599
John.

48:25.736 --> 48:28.073
I can take that from you now.

48:36.114 --> 48:37.415
Thank you.

48:45.890 --> 48:46.891
Thank you.

48:46.992 --> 48:48.693
The cleric is indebted to you.

48:48.759 --> 48:50.528
Leave your hotel tomorrow.

48:50.595 --> 48:54.165
You'll transfer the bag
to El-Mashad on the19th.

49:06.477 --> 49:08.246
I'm going to be asking
a lot of you,

49:08.313 --> 49:11.682
it seems like,
this year, Edward.

49:11.749 --> 49:13.784
Um...

49:13.851 --> 49:17.355
Um, yeah, Dad,

49:17.422 --> 49:18.756
about John?

49:18.823 --> 49:20.691
Yes.

49:20.758 --> 49:23.228
Then yeah, for sure.

49:24.562 --> 49:25.563
Why for sure?

49:26.664 --> 49:29.667
Um, because it's family.

49:31.202 --> 49:34.305
So that's for sure. It's family.

49:34.372 --> 49:35.840
You'll do everything,
in that case.

49:35.906 --> 49:38.042
Yeah. Yes.

49:38.043 --> 49:40.611
And I can count on that?

49:40.678 --> 49:44.449
Yeah. Go ahead.

49:44.515 --> 49:46.051
Count on it.

49:48.053 --> 49:49.354
Hey.

49:49.420 --> 49:50.420
Hey.

49:53.491 --> 49:56.594
That word means
a lot to me, Edward.

49:58.229 --> 50:02.500
Because everything else
is just bullshit.

50:17.014 --> 50:18.616
Hey, Efram.

50:20.385 --> 50:24.055
You know how your mom
sometimes talks to me like...

50:25.590 --> 50:27.358
I don't know, like...

50:27.425 --> 50:29.327
Like I am your dad, maybe,

50:29.394 --> 50:31.562
like she'll yell at me a lot,

50:31.629 --> 50:33.231
like, so much
that it would be weird

50:33.298 --> 50:36.434
if we were just Beltway Buddies.

50:36.501 --> 50:38.703
Anyway, I think that...
That could be...

50:38.769 --> 50:40.938
That might be kind of
confusing for you, right?

50:42.440 --> 50:44.675
Well, do you want to hear
a... a bedtime story

50:44.742 --> 50:48.246
that'll hopefully
maybe clear that up?

50:49.514 --> 50:51.382
Awesome.

50:51.449 --> 50:52.350
Okay.

50:52.417 --> 50:54.719
Once upon a time...

50:56.354 --> 51:01.626
there was a Congressman
who liked to dance.

51:01.692 --> 51:03.661
I don't know.

51:03.728 --> 51:07.732
We can,
we'll call him Cool Rick.

51:07.798 --> 51:12.403
And Cool Rick went out dancing
in a D.C. area nightclub,

51:12.470 --> 51:17.808
and he met, this woman.
Let's call her...

51:17.875 --> 51:21.512
well, we... we can
call her Your Mom.

51:21.579 --> 51:25.150
Okay? And Your Mom was
a really great dancer,

51:25.216 --> 51:27.885
and she did all kinds of things

51:27.952 --> 51:29.987
that Cool Rick did not expect

51:30.054 --> 51:31.722
as he was getting to know her,

51:31.789 --> 51:34.559
like make him laugh.

51:36.761 --> 51:38.829
And have a baby.

51:40.064 --> 51:42.467
But, see, Cool Rick
is a Congressman

51:42.533 --> 51:46.604
for just assholes
who are stupid as shit,

51:46.671 --> 51:49.274
and they live
in this shitty place

51:49.340 --> 51:50.608
called Bridgerose, Texas,

51:50.675 --> 51:53.378
and they do not like
guys like Cool Rick

51:53.444 --> 51:56.314
who have children when
they're not married,

51:56.381 --> 52:01.286
so even if he was,
um, really your dad,

52:01.352 --> 52:03.588
he couldn't tell anyone.

52:04.855 --> 52:06.857
But Cool Rick loves you...

52:08.393 --> 52:10.195
so much, man.

52:13.564 --> 52:15.266
Tom, the guy we gave the bag to,

52:15.333 --> 52:17.335
not executing the plan.

52:17.402 --> 52:19.204
And Tom, listen.

52:19.237 --> 52:20.714
There is an indication
that this involves

52:20.738 --> 52:23.574
a physicist they're recruiting.

52:23.641 --> 52:25.876
Tom, you may have gotten conned.

52:25.943 --> 52:28.713
We might have handed
the bag to the cleric.

52:31.749 --> 52:33.218
So I just wanted to know.

52:33.251 --> 52:34.985
Did something happen
in Luxembourg?

52:35.052 --> 52:36.954
I checked the paper
last night online.

52:37.021 --> 52:39.089
I read someone was killed.

52:39.224 --> 52:40.725
The Luxembourg paper?

52:40.791 --> 52:43.227
Yeah. The Wort.

52:43.228 --> 52:46.897
Do... Do you have to pay
and sign up for that?

52:46.964 --> 52:48.499
Did you have to pay for that?

52:48.566 --> 52:49.967
Like, half the article is free,

52:50.034 --> 52:51.645
and I had to get it monthly
for the other half,

52:51.669 --> 52:54.138
but, John, I went
to the hospital that night.

52:54.239 --> 52:55.640
That's why I brought it up.

52:55.706 --> 52:57.375
I'm sorry. I went.

52:57.442 --> 52:59.410
It was just... It was
too close to my dick.

52:59.477 --> 53:01.111
I think you grazed
one of my testicles,

53:01.246 --> 53:02.380
and I just... I freaked.

53:02.447 --> 53:03.887
I went. I know
you told me not to go,

53:03.948 --> 53:05.249
but I didn't know that

53:05.250 --> 53:07.285
you were going to stab
a Brazilian guy.

53:07.352 --> 53:09.787
And this morning a detective
called from Luxembourg...

53:09.854 --> 53:11.922
This lady. Because I got stabbed

53:11.989 --> 53:13.524
the same night in Luxembourg.

53:15.025 --> 53:16.927
Let's talk about this tomorrow.

53:16.994 --> 53:18.429
Okay. Cool.

53:25.736 --> 53:26.637
Leslie.

53:26.704 --> 53:29.374
Leslie, I...
I wanted to apologize,

53:29.440 --> 53:32.877
Leslie, for the Dennen
meeting in Luxembourg.

53:32.943 --> 53:35.280
I know we go back in a week.

53:35.346 --> 53:40.084
I assure you I'll make a much
better impression on Dennen then.

53:40.150 --> 53:41.462
I'm not sure
that we're bringing you

53:41.486 --> 53:43.288
back to Luxembourg, Lakeman.

53:43.321 --> 53:47.091
I'm not sure that you're still
on the traveling squad, son.

53:47.157 --> 53:49.394
We'll see.

53:49.460 --> 53:51.161
Maybe you'll stay here,

53:51.296 --> 53:53.298
get your piping in order.

53:56.734 --> 53:59.036
Hey, man. Remember me?

53:59.103 --> 54:00.371
I'm Stephen.

54:00.438 --> 54:02.206
Slow down, Stephen.

54:02.307 --> 54:05.175
W-We met before.

54:05.310 --> 54:06.477
Yeah.

54:06.544 --> 54:08.145
Yeah, what...
What are you doing...

54:08.212 --> 54:09.780
McMillan wanted me to come in

54:09.847 --> 54:12.383
and work on your
processing slates

54:12.450 --> 54:14.051
because they suck.

54:14.118 --> 54:15.486
That's good.

54:15.553 --> 54:18.989
You're the process
engineer, right?

54:19.056 --> 54:22.927
I don't remember much
of our conversation.

54:22.993 --> 54:25.396
I had an accident.

54:25.463 --> 54:27.898
Stephen will get his
memory back over time,

54:27.965 --> 54:29.800
if he does his exercises

54:29.867 --> 54:32.337
and finishes his full
therapy program.

54:32.403 --> 54:34.071
Later, man.

54:34.138 --> 54:35.340
Later.

54:55.760 --> 54:56.927
Hello.

54:56.994 --> 54:59.229
Not quite
the in and out we expected.

54:59.364 --> 55:00.998
No, not really.

55:01.065 --> 55:02.667
Our guy, the bag, gone.

55:02.733 --> 55:04.435
He never landed in Iran.

55:04.502 --> 55:06.437
He doesn't seem to have
left Luxembourg.

55:06.504 --> 55:08.706
El-Mashad, physicist,

55:08.773 --> 55:10.508
waiting for his
10 million euros,

55:10.575 --> 55:12.543
he just bought a plane
ticket to Luxembourg.

55:12.610 --> 55:14.512
I think the cleric's
behind this.

55:14.579 --> 55:16.080
The cleric played us, John.

55:16.146 --> 55:18.382
El-Mashad and that bag
can't get together.

55:18.383 --> 55:20.384
We go back in a week.

55:20.385 --> 55:21.419
I'll be there.

55:21.486 --> 55:22.687
Goodbye, son.

55:26.290 --> 55:28.993
Also...

55:29.059 --> 55:30.595
you keep parking

55:30.661 --> 55:33.063
in my fucking parking spot.
