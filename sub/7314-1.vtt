GIBBS: For attacks
against the United States Navy:

00:07.875 --> 00:09.607
Harper Dearing.

00:09.609 --> 00:10.676
You know Dearing had
a son in the Navy, right?

00:10.678 --> 00:12.345
He was killed
in a suicide attack

00:12.347 --> 00:13.713
while his ship was in port.

00:13.715 --> 00:14.880
DEARING:
The terrorist attack

00:14.882 --> 00:16.581
that killed my son Evan
did not need to happen.

00:16.583 --> 00:19.719
I need you to find an old
case file from 12 years ago.

00:19.721 --> 00:21.055
Got it:
Evan Dearing.

00:21.057 --> 00:23.924
VANCE: <i>His father is</i>
<i>targeting NCIS in retaliation</i>

00:23.926 --> 00:26.193
for the son being reassigned
to that destroyer.

00:26.195 --> 00:27.894
Director, he's not after you.

00:27.896 --> 00:29.296
He's after your car.

00:29.298 --> 00:29.963
Go.

00:35.335 --> 00:37.870
(exhales loudly)

00:53.658 --> 00:54.959
DOCTOR:
Pupils are reactive.

00:54.961 --> 00:57.228
His color's improving.

00:57.230 --> 00:58.830
Dr. Mallard?

00:58.832 --> 01:00.900
Dr. Mallard,
you've had a heart attack.

01:00.902 --> 01:04.269
NURSE:
BP's 172/95.

01:04.272 --> 01:05.271
Pulse is thready.

01:05.272 --> 01:06.673
Get him on a
low-dose vasodilator.

01:06.675 --> 01:09.209
Schedule an echo
and get a TPA started.

01:10.145 --> 01:11.846
Okay, lab work is back.

01:11.848 --> 01:13.181
CPK is elevated.

01:13.883 --> 01:15.450
(murmurs)

01:15.452 --> 01:17.653
Doctor, do you know
where you are?

01:17.655 --> 01:20.489
Purgatory.

01:20.491 --> 01:21.791
The hospital.

01:21.793 --> 01:24.528
Same thing.

01:24.530 --> 01:25.862
You're lucky people
found you on the beach.

01:25.864 --> 01:28.698
Mr. Palmer's been
with you the whole time.

01:31.502 --> 01:33.470
Are they all right?

01:33.472 --> 01:36.874
Let's just focus on you
and this situation,

01:36.876 --> 01:38.242
and then later we can talk.

01:38.244 --> 01:41.011
Are...

01:41.013 --> 01:42.680
they...

01:42.682 --> 01:44.916
all right?

01:46.552 --> 01:49.988
I don't know.

01:49.990 --> 01:52.925
I haven't been able
to reach anyone.

Yes.

How many?

03:23.550 --> 03:25.751
Enough.

03:25.753 --> 03:26.952
There's plenty of damage, too.

03:26.954 --> 03:29.988
The President was just
briefed on the situation.

03:29.990 --> 03:31.523
I'll need details
and a plan of action.

03:31.525 --> 03:32.558

The plan is I find
the rest of my team, sir.

03:37.427 --> 03:38.860
Of course.

03:38.862 --> 03:40.594
FBI and other agencies
are coming in,

03:40.596 --> 03:41.729
making it a joint effort.

03:41.731 --> 03:45.031
We won't stop
until we find Dearing.

03:49.270 --> 03:51.303

Good. Find your people.

Make sure they're safe and
then I want this son of a bitch.

You and me both.

04:03.576 --> 04:06.408
(groans)

04:06.410 --> 04:08.510
I'm so glad we broke protocol
and took the elevator.

04:08.512 --> 04:11.613
Whose bright idea
was that anyway?

04:11.615 --> 04:14.215
What?
TONY: Ooh!

04:14.217 --> 04:16.082
Xenia Onatopp, the Bond
villain from <i>GoldenEye--</i>

04:16.084 --> 04:17.716
Famke Janssen.

04:17.718 --> 04:18.950
She would kill men

04:18.952 --> 04:22.453
by squeezing her muscular,
well-shaved thighs.

04:22.455 --> 04:24.321

04:24.323 --> 04:26.389
Well, I can think
of worse ways to die.

04:26.391 --> 04:28.224
I'm almost...

04:28.226 --> 04:29.225
there.

04:29.227 --> 04:31.493
(loud thud)

04:31.495 --> 04:32.761
Ah, we're stuck.

04:32.763 --> 04:34.563
Well, keep pushing, thighmaster.

04:34.565 --> 04:36.498
I'm starting to enjoy this.

04:37.767 --> 04:39.268
Something's blocking it.

04:39.270 --> 04:41.103
It's jammed.

04:41.105 --> 04:43.805
They're gonna have to open it
from the outside.

04:43.807 --> 04:45.073
(rumbling)
Ooh!

04:47.777 --> 04:48.844
(Ziva grunts)

04:48.846 --> 04:49.878
We slipped.

04:49.880 --> 04:50.879
Did we?

04:50.881 --> 04:53.315
I thought the earth moved.

04:53.317 --> 04:56.118
You're sweating.

04:56.120 --> 04:57.719
Well, it's hot in here.

04:57.721 --> 04:59.921
I had not noticed.

04:59.923 --> 05:01.456
Really?

05:01.458 --> 05:04.425

05:08.430 --> 05:11.298

05:11.300 --> 05:14.134
Yes, yes, I am all right.

05:14.136 --> 05:17.704
(speaking Hebrew)

05:18.906 --> 05:21.975
No, Abba, we're stuck
in an elevator.

05:21.977 --> 05:25.311
My father says it's all
over the news in Israel.

05:25.313 --> 05:28.047
Uh, can you ask
the great Eli David

05:28.049 --> 05:29.816
if maybe he can help us
find Harper Dearing?

05:29.818 --> 05:31.852
He's actually offering that.

05:31.854 --> 05:33.220
Ooh, fantastic.

05:33.222 --> 05:36.122
And while you are
asking favors here,

05:36.124 --> 05:38.658
is there any way he can
get us out of this elevator?

05:38.660 --> 05:39.793
(speaking Hebrew)

05:39.795 --> 05:41.962
Yeah, well, no.

05:41.964 --> 05:43.597
Tony's never going
to change, Abba.

05:43.599 --> 05:44.598
And we are fine.

05:44.600 --> 05:49.203
We are fine, yes.

05:49.205 --> 05:53.106
(speaking Hebrew)

05:53.108 --> 05:54.441
That's sweet.

05:54.443 --> 05:55.776
Your dad called.

05:55.778 --> 05:58.311
My father should
be calling any second.

05:58.313 --> 06:00.747
Hmm.

06:02.784 --> 06:05.252
(sirens blaring)

06:05.254 --> 06:09.055
(helicopters flying overhead)

06:10.057 --> 06:12.626
(McGee coughs)

06:12.628 --> 06:14.161
Hey, Boss.

06:14.163 --> 06:15.695
You okay?

06:15.697 --> 06:17.930
Uh, yeah, I think so.

06:17.932 --> 06:19.165
You?

06:19.167 --> 06:22.502
(sighs)

06:22.504 --> 06:23.703
Where's Tony and Ziva?

06:25.606 --> 06:27.273
Um, elevator.

06:27.275 --> 06:29.209
Workers are on it.

06:29.211 --> 06:31.711
Feels really warm
in here.

06:31.713 --> 06:34.614
Think I'm gonna go
get some fresh air.

06:34.616 --> 06:36.049
Hey, stop.

06:36.051 --> 06:37.517
What?

06:46.127 --> 06:47.861
Uh-oh.

06:55.725 --> 06:57.859
REPORTER:
Earlier today, the President

06:57.861 --> 06:59.361
toured the site
of the Navy bombing.

06:59.363 --> 07:02.197
Later at a press conference,
he referred to the attack

07:02.199 --> 07:04.133
as a senseless
act of terrorism

07:04.135 --> 07:06.402
and vowed to punish
those responsible...

07:06.404 --> 07:07.836
Unbelievable.

07:07.838 --> 07:10.805
What is unbelievable
is the way I feel.

07:10.807 --> 07:13.274
Dr. Mallard, you're awake.

07:13.276 --> 07:16.645
I must get back
to Washington immediately.

07:16.647 --> 07:18.547
Back to Washington?

07:18.549 --> 07:20.983
They need me.

07:20.985 --> 07:23.085
First air transport
you can arrange for us.

07:23.087 --> 07:26.489
Even if we have to drive
over to the Naval Air Base

07:26.491 --> 07:27.490
in Jacksonville.

07:27.492 --> 07:29.592
Use my name if you must.

07:29.594 --> 07:31.261
Dr. Mallard, you are
in no condition...

07:31.263 --> 07:32.395
To what?

07:32.397 --> 07:34.597
To remain here in this

07:34.599 --> 07:37.567
germ-ridden petri dish?

07:37.569 --> 07:39.603
The-The meds are
performing brilliantly.

07:39.605 --> 07:42.539
And once the stents
are in place,

07:42.541 --> 07:47.443
I will be capable...
of assisting.

07:47.445 --> 07:50.679
Dr. Mallard?

07:50.681 --> 07:52.615
You go without me.

07:52.617 --> 07:54.717
You have to.

07:54.719 --> 07:55.684
No, I don't.

07:55.686 --> 07:56.885
I've got to be here for you.

07:56.887 --> 07:58.187
Someone has to talk
to the doctors.

07:58.189 --> 07:59.622
I will be perfectly
fine, Mr. Palmer.

07:59.624 --> 08:01.490
I can have Breena
come down here...

08:01.492 --> 08:03.092
You need me.

08:03.094 --> 08:07.129
They need you more.

08:17.708 --> 08:19.175
VANCE:
Agent Fornell,

08:19.177 --> 08:20.242
thank you for coming aboard.

08:20.244 --> 08:23.045
I can't think of any place
I'd rather be.

08:23.047 --> 08:25.147
Absolutely, sir,
one second.

08:25.882 --> 08:27.183
The President.

08:28.119 --> 08:29.385
Special Agent McGee?

08:29.387 --> 08:31.421
He got lucky: stitches.

08:31.423 --> 08:32.788
Agents DiNozzo and David?

08:32.789 --> 08:34.289
They're still in the elevator.

08:34.292 --> 08:35.725
Debris fell on top of the car.

08:35.727 --> 08:36.993
That must be cozy.

08:36.995 --> 08:39.162
Let me know as soon
as they're out.

08:39.164 --> 08:41.164
What about Dr. Mallard?

08:41.166 --> 08:43.799
Ducky had a heart attack.

08:43.802 --> 08:45.602
Palmer's on his way here.

08:45.604 --> 08:47.003
Ducky's stable.

08:47.005 --> 08:50.440
The old man's stronger
than all of us combined.

08:50.442 --> 08:53.710
Thank you, Mr. President.

08:55.746 --> 08:57.314
Sir, I believe
you've already met

08:57.316 --> 08:59.382
Senior Agent Fornell
with the FBI.

08:59.384 --> 09:01.050
Mr. Secretary.

09:01.986 --> 09:03.886
I know we don't have
an operational SCIF,

09:03.888 --> 09:05.722
so what I have to say
stays in this room.

09:05.724 --> 09:08.024
We've been instructed

09:08.026 --> 09:09.426
to locate Harper Dearing

09:09.428 --> 09:11.762
and proceed
with extreme prejudice.

09:11.764 --> 09:14.364
We're going to pool
our resources

09:14.366 --> 09:15.766
and end this once and for all.

09:15.768 --> 09:16.767
Questions?

09:16.769 --> 09:18.869
Just one.

09:20.538 --> 09:21.872
Dearing has been eluding us
for months.

09:21.874 --> 09:23.340
What makes you think
we're gonna get him now?

09:23.342 --> 09:27.077
This comes from the President.

09:27.079 --> 09:29.346
Failure is not an option.

09:31.649 --> 09:35.785
How much longer are we
gonna be stuck in here?

09:35.787 --> 09:39.389
Hello?

09:39.391 --> 09:40.924
Anybody?

09:40.926 --> 09:42.592
It's been hours, Tony.

09:42.594 --> 09:44.961
I cannot take
much more of this.

09:44.963 --> 09:48.498
What's that supposed
to mean?

09:48.500 --> 09:49.566
I suppose it is getting

09:49.568 --> 09:50.901
a little... ripe in here?

09:50.903 --> 09:53.036
(scoffs)
I'm not ripe.

09:53.038 --> 09:54.838
You, on the other
hand, are...

09:54.840 --> 09:58.141
pungent.

09:58.143 --> 10:01.278
Well, could be worse.

10:01.280 --> 10:03.213
You could be stuck
in this tin can

10:03.215 --> 10:05.915
with Miguel
from Human Resources.

10:05.917 --> 10:07.116
(laughs)

10:07.118 --> 10:09.785
He sweats more than anyone
I've ever known.

10:09.787 --> 10:12.054
(chuckles)

10:12.056 --> 10:14.222
How about Jeremy
from Office Operations?

10:14.224 --> 10:15.991
That guy.

10:15.993 --> 10:18.260
He's always undressing you
with his eyes.

10:18.262 --> 10:19.428
(sighs)

10:19.430 --> 10:21.830
I mean, he's fun,
but a little creepy.

10:24.367 --> 10:29.472
Hey, what if one
of those men is dead?

10:33.911 --> 10:35.144
(thudding)

10:35.146 --> 10:36.312
Hello?

10:38.249 --> 10:39.817
Oh, hey, hey, hey.

10:39.819 --> 10:41.752
There you are!

10:41.754 --> 10:44.422
Abby, I've never been more happy
to see your gorgeous face.

10:44.424 --> 10:46.224
Ah, you guys must be ready
to kill each other.

10:46.226 --> 10:48.093
I mean, I can't think
of who I'd want

10:48.095 --> 10:50.262
to be stuck in an
elevator with, except

10:50.264 --> 10:51.697
maybe Amelia Earhart
or Michelle Obama

10:51.699 --> 10:54.400
or, or Joan of Arc, or the whole
cast of Cirque du Soleil

10:54.402 --> 10:55.802
in case I got bored, I could...

10:55.804 --> 10:58.105
Abby.
Abby.

11:01.042 --> 11:03.343
FORNELL: <i>You never dress up</i>
<i>for me anymore.</i>

11:12.855 --> 11:15.357
You hungry?

11:17.459 --> 11:19.460
You call your old man,

11:19.462 --> 11:21.628
tell him you're okay?

11:23.231 --> 11:24.931
Yep.

11:29.670 --> 11:31.704
You take a break, Jethro.
You're home now.

11:31.706 --> 11:34.907
Navy Yard is my home, too.

11:34.909 --> 11:37.409
It didn't stop him, Tobias.

11:41.215 --> 11:43.416
He hurt my family.

11:43.418 --> 11:45.585
I know.

11:53.060 --> 11:55.228
Brought cannoli.

11:58.432 --> 12:00.633
What's next, huh?

12:03.503 --> 12:05.705
What if Dearing's done?

12:05.707 --> 12:07.340
He can't just walk away.

12:07.342 --> 12:08.908
Oh, yeah, he can.
Sure, he can.

12:08.910 --> 12:11.377
He can go under.
How?

12:11.379 --> 12:13.412
Every federal agency
is on alert.

12:16.249 --> 12:20.019
Will you let me take the reins
on this one, Jethro?

12:22.255 --> 12:25.458
The President said to proceed
with extreme prejudice.

12:26.493 --> 12:28.961
I'm proceeding.

12:30.931 --> 12:33.132
(car horns honking)

12:50.248 --> 12:52.882
It's crazy, huh?

12:53.717 --> 12:55.318
Excuse me?

12:55.320 --> 12:57.654
Ah, I was just thinking
how one minute

12:57.656 --> 13:02.460
everybody's gossiping about
some celebrity, and then...

13:02.462 --> 13:04.662
something bad happens,
and people remember.

13:06.798 --> 13:09.466
Remember how lucky we are.

13:11.336 --> 13:13.171
Yeah.

13:13.173 --> 13:15.373
Very fortunate.

13:18.377 --> 13:21.680
Name's Lorraine.

13:21.682 --> 13:24.683
Look, I don't
know you, but...

13:24.685 --> 13:26.084
you want to go
somewhere?

13:26.953 --> 13:30.156
Talk or something?

13:34.162 --> 13:36.363
(laughs seductively)

13:44.506 --> 13:45.739
Come on, now.

13:45.741 --> 13:47.775
Loosen up.

13:50.512 --> 13:52.713
(mellow Latin music plays)

14:00.355 --> 14:02.523
Can I get you a drink?

14:03.559 --> 14:06.060
You mind if I use the restroom?

14:06.929 --> 14:08.530
I'll be right here.

14:22.378 --> 14:24.545
(water running)

14:34.889 --> 14:37.090
(door creaks quietly)

14:56.443 --> 14:58.611
(water running)

15:06.086 --> 15:08.287
(cell phone ringing)

15:19.866 --> 15:22.434
Those were my people
he blew up last night.

15:22.436 --> 15:24.136
Lorraine was one
of the best we had.

15:24.138 --> 15:25.905
I am truly sorry,
Agent Fornell.

15:25.907 --> 15:27.406
Traps won't work, Tobias.
I told you that.

15:27.408 --> 15:29.108
FORNELL: That guy's that smart?
GIBBS: Yeah.

15:29.110 --> 15:30.810
ZIVA: But he did not start
the altercation; we did.

15:30.812 --> 15:31.778
He was just defending himself.

15:31.780 --> 15:33.046
Whose side are you on?

15:33.048 --> 15:34.248
Whose side
am I on?

15:34.250 --> 15:35.849
Look, I'm merely
trying to point out

15:35.851 --> 15:37.484
he is no longer
taunting us.

15:37.486 --> 15:38.952
We are taunting him.

15:40.288 --> 15:42.289
Uh-oh.
I know that look.

15:42.291 --> 15:43.857
That's the
"stay-up-all-night,

15:43.859 --> 15:45.292
"no-sleep,
take-one-for-the-team

15:45.294 --> 15:46.493
I-got-a-plan" look.

15:46.495 --> 15:47.961
Jethro?

15:47.963 --> 15:49.863
Well, Ziva's right.

15:49.865 --> 15:51.198
Force the turnover.

15:51.200 --> 15:53.867
We take the fight to him.

15:53.869 --> 15:55.669
And make him keep playing.

16:06.459 --> 16:08.593
REPORTER: The FBI held
a press conference today.

16:08.595 --> 16:10.796
They've arrested
Victoria Dearing,

16:10.798 --> 16:13.198
ex-wife of wanted homeland
terrorist Harper Dearing,

16:13.200 --> 16:16.735
in connection to this week's
bombing at NCIS headquarters.

16:16.737 --> 16:18.637
Charges ranging from murder

16:18.639 --> 16:20.072
to conspiracy to commit
a terrorist act

16:20.074 --> 16:21.941
have been filed against her.

16:21.943 --> 16:23.342
(mutes television)

16:23.344 --> 16:25.411
So where is she, Gibbs?

16:25.413 --> 16:27.580
She's out of the state.

16:27.582 --> 16:30.317
Under federal protection.
She's safe.

16:30.319 --> 16:31.517
And if Dearing believes

16:31.519 --> 16:32.852
that we're pushing her
for information,

16:32.854 --> 16:34.654
you think his pot
might boil over.

16:34.656 --> 16:36.556
How do you know
he won't just blow up

16:36.558 --> 16:38.324
something else in return?

16:38.326 --> 16:39.993
He could,
but he won't.

16:39.995 --> 16:41.194
What makes you so sure?

16:41.196 --> 16:44.063
He did what he set out to do.

16:44.065 --> 16:46.333
Now he just wants
to be left alone.

16:47.301 --> 16:49.403
So we throw a stick of
dynamite in the water,

16:49.405 --> 16:50.938
and see what floats
to the surface.

16:50.940 --> 16:52.740
Might work.
It might not.

16:52.742 --> 16:55.042
(chuckles)

16:55.044 --> 16:57.845
What do you want
from me, Gibbs?

16:57.847 --> 17:00.047
Stop feeling sorry
for yourself.

17:01.016 --> 17:03.117
It was my car
that caused this.

17:03.119 --> 17:04.852
I drove that bomb in here.

17:04.854 --> 17:07.521
Navy men and women,
innocent people,

17:07.523 --> 17:09.022
are dead, injured, and missing

17:09.025 --> 17:10.558
because of something that I did.

17:11.425 --> 17:12.893
You couldn't have known, Leon.

17:12.895 --> 17:15.063
It's my job to know.

17:20.970 --> 17:23.305
Leon, this is what
Dearing wants.

17:23.307 --> 17:25.941
He wants you to question
yourself.

17:25.943 --> 17:29.377
Wants this to gnaw away at you
from the inside out.

17:30.179 --> 17:32.247
Gotta be stronger
than that, Leon.

17:33.115 --> 17:35.050
For all of us.

17:38.722 --> 17:39.688
Good news.

17:39.690 --> 17:41.891
McGee was released
from the hospital.

17:42.459 --> 17:43.759
Great.

17:43.761 --> 17:46.061
I'm sure he has a nice
big scar to show for it.

17:46.063 --> 17:48.230
Well, the doctor said
it is not too significant,

17:48.232 --> 17:49.365
and maybe...
Maybe,

17:49.367 --> 17:51.668
if the doctor had diagnosed
Harper Dearing

17:51.670 --> 17:53.236
as a clinical nut job
years ago,

17:53.238 --> 17:54.737
then none of this
would have happened.

17:54.739 --> 17:56.806
Okay.

17:56.808 --> 17:57.941
I see you're upset.

17:57.943 --> 17:59.543
I mean, we are upset, too.

17:59.545 --> 18:00.977
But... we're safe.

18:00.979 --> 18:02.713
And you have to focus on that.

18:02.715 --> 18:04.314
You have to focus on the good.

18:04.316 --> 18:06.884
"The good""

18:06.886 --> 18:08.219
What "good""

18:08.221 --> 18:11.121
Harper Dearing
took that away.

18:11.123 --> 18:14.225
First, he-he goes
after innocent sailors,

18:14.227 --> 18:16.894
and then he comes after us,
where we live.

18:16.896 --> 18:20.664
All I see is pain
and destruction.

18:20.666 --> 18:22.867
(sighs)

18:26.104 --> 18:29.407
I don't see good.

18:29.409 --> 18:31.977
I want good back.

18:31.979 --> 18:34.146
Abby...

18:37.350 --> 18:40.852
If anyone can find the good,

18:40.854 --> 18:42.854
it is you.

18:42.856 --> 18:45.022
I have no doubt.

18:45.991 --> 18:48.592
What if this isn't over?

18:48.594 --> 18:50.762
What if Dearing isn't done?

18:50.764 --> 18:54.599
A terrorist is only as strong
as the fear he creates.

18:55.434 --> 18:57.635
Ziva, please.

19:04.243 --> 19:08.313
Kick his ass.

19:10.116 --> 19:11.950
Boss, I just got back
from the armory.

19:11.952 --> 19:13.018
They got hit pretty
hard down there.

19:13.020 --> 19:14.954
Yeah, well...
they were close.

19:14.956 --> 19:17.189
We help any way
we can, DiNozzo.

19:19.960 --> 19:21.594
Can I ask you a question?

19:22.663 --> 19:27.100
Have you talked to Dr. Ryan
since all this happened?

19:28.269 --> 19:31.938
Think maybe you should...
tell her you're okay?

19:33.808 --> 19:36.543
I think we've got
a lot of work to do.

19:40.380 --> 19:43.349
Must've been nice
having someone to talk to.

19:43.351 --> 19:44.783
For a little while.

19:44.785 --> 19:46.018
VANCE:
Gibbs!

19:46.020 --> 19:47.553
MTAC. Now.

19:58.397 --> 19:59.598
Welcome back, Tim.

19:59.600 --> 20:00.699
McGEE:
Thanks, boss.

20:00.701 --> 20:02.134
Nothing a band-aid wouldn't fix.

20:02.136 --> 20:04.670
Agent McGee,
put him up.

20:07.140 --> 20:09.909
Did you really think that
that was gonna work,

20:09.911 --> 20:11.410
Agent Gibbs?

20:11.412 --> 20:13.279
Accusing my ex-wife

20:13.281 --> 20:15.881
of aiding and abetting when
you knew she was innocent?

20:15.883 --> 20:17.616
You're playing games!

20:17.618 --> 20:19.551
What, and you're not?

20:19.553 --> 20:20.786
Games have a winner.

20:20.788 --> 20:23.155
Nobody won yesterday.
People got hurt.

20:23.157 --> 20:24.923
People got hurt
by your hand.

20:24.925 --> 20:26.224
Well, consider it
cause and effect:

20:26.226 --> 20:28.460
your cause, my effect,
lesson learned.

20:28.462 --> 20:30.863
There's easier ways to teach
somebody a lesson.

20:30.865 --> 20:32.998
Well, I thought
it was appropriate.

20:33.000 --> 20:35.334
What you think
doesn't matter much.

20:35.336 --> 20:38.837
DEARING: You don't give people
enough credit, Agent Gibbs.

20:38.839 --> 20:42.107
The Navy turned a blind eye
to flaws in the system,

20:42.109 --> 20:45.177
and I made sure that
that would not happen again.

20:45.179 --> 20:46.378
You killed people.

20:46.380 --> 20:47.646
I am a whistle-blower.

20:47.648 --> 20:48.747
You're a murderer.

20:48.749 --> 20:50.215
What do you want?

20:50.217 --> 20:51.416
You got our attention.

20:51.418 --> 20:53.051
What's next?

20:53.053 --> 20:55.920
Oh, there's nothing next,
Director.

20:55.922 --> 20:57.488
And if you insist on

20:57.490 --> 21:00.358
coming after me,
keep this in mind:

21:00.360 --> 21:02.260
There is no better player

21:02.262 --> 21:04.862
than a man
who's got nothing to lose.

21:05.897 --> 21:06.864
Agent McGee.

21:06.866 --> 21:08.465
Got a trace on Dearing's cell.

21:08.467 --> 21:10.967
Broke through his firewall.

21:11.802 --> 21:13.870
Or he let you.

21:13.872 --> 21:15.371
He's parked in an abandoned

21:15.373 --> 21:17.606
restaurant parking lot
off Route 9.

21:17.608 --> 21:20.342
McGee, get me the SECNAV.

21:20.344 --> 21:22.578
McGEE:
Connecting.

21:23.413 --> 21:25.047
VANCE:
Sir?

21:25.049 --> 21:26.248
We got him.

21:26.250 --> 21:28.184
Is there still
a SWAT team on standby?

21:28.186 --> 21:29.452
Airborne, Leon.

21:29.454 --> 21:30.820
Send the coordinates;
they'll make it happen.

21:30.822 --> 21:32.621
VANCE:
McGee.

21:34.090 --> 21:35.958
Target coordinates delivered,
Director.

21:35.960 --> 21:37.827
Traffic cams.

21:39.930 --> 21:41.464
Uh, not responding.

21:41.466 --> 21:43.666
McGEE: Switching to
thermal satellite.

21:47.938 --> 21:49.005
The engine's running.

21:49.007 --> 21:50.940
The car's hot.

21:50.942 --> 21:52.809
The heater's on inside, too.

21:52.811 --> 21:54.344
Can't be sure, but that looks

21:54.346 --> 21:56.812
like one passenger
in the driver's seat.

21:56.814 --> 21:58.681
SWAT LEADER:
We are ten seconds from touchdown.

21:58.683 --> 21:59.782
Request command confirmation.

21:59.784 --> 22:01.951
Team 1, this is SECNAV.
Confirmation is go.

22:01.953 --> 22:04.887
I repeat: Confirmation is go.

22:04.889 --> 22:06.789
Roger that.
We are locked and loaded.

22:06.791 --> 22:12.295
Touching down in
four, three, two, one.

22:12.297 --> 22:14.097
Go! Go! Go!

22:15.767 --> 22:18.536
Approaching from right flank!
Securing the vehicle!

22:19.805 --> 22:23.341
Get down! Get down!

22:24.910 --> 22:26.711
Target is gone.

22:26.713 --> 22:28.313
Repeat: Vehicle is destroyed.

22:28.315 --> 22:30.681
What the hell just happened,
Leon?

22:30.683 --> 22:33.451
He took himself out, sir.

22:33.453 --> 22:34.685
He blew the car up.

22:34.687 --> 22:37.322
So he's dead. It's over.

22:37.324 --> 22:39.491
Sir, you need remains
for confirmation.

22:40.860 --> 22:42.761
Dot your "I"s, cross your "T"s,
Gibbs.

22:42.763 --> 22:44.230
Just get it done.

22:54.509 --> 22:56.409
My best friend
has a heart attack,

22:56.411 --> 22:59.112
and here I am
doing his job.

22:59.114 --> 23:01.414
A job I would have been nervous
enough about doing

23:01.416 --> 23:03.383
even if I didn't just stepped
off the plane

23:03.385 --> 23:06.787
after having not slept
for two days.

23:06.789 --> 23:10.924
And you are not helping
matters, Abby!

23:10.926 --> 23:12.659
Would you please just come in?

23:12.661 --> 23:15.662
No. You know I don't
like it down here.

23:15.664 --> 23:19.399
And I refuse to be in the same
room with that... man.

23:19.401 --> 23:22.168
That man is dead, Abby.

23:22.170 --> 23:24.371
I still haven't even reached
any next of kin.

23:24.373 --> 23:25.872
Too bad.

23:25.874 --> 23:27.173
Still not helping.

23:27.175 --> 23:28.841
Sorry, Jimmy.

23:29.777 --> 23:31.711
I've only had a couple hours
with the body.

23:31.713 --> 23:34.080
I can't possibly give
a full autopsy report.

23:35.216 --> 23:40.488
Abby, will you stop!
Gentlemen, hi.

23:40.490 --> 23:42.890
Congrats, Palmer.
Thank you.

23:42.892 --> 23:45.727
Although, I think under
the current circumstances,

23:45.729 --> 23:48.130
my being here doing
Dr. Mallard's job

23:48.132 --> 23:50.232
is hardly worthy
of congratulations.

23:50.234 --> 23:55.271
You meant congratulations on the
marriage, didn't you? (chuckles)

23:55.273 --> 23:57.940
You know, I think I'm still
getting used to all this.

23:57.942 --> 23:59.274
Get used to it faster,

23:59.276 --> 24:00.475
Palmer. Talk.

24:00.477 --> 24:03.878
Yes, sir. Um, I was
finally able to find

24:03.880 --> 24:05.980
a usable tissue sample
from the deceased,

24:05.982 --> 24:10.385
and Abby is standing by waiting
expedited DNA confirmation.

24:11.788 --> 24:13.422
This is top priority,

24:13.424 --> 24:15.790
so it should be here
any time now.

24:25.034 --> 24:26.601
Got it.

24:29.104 --> 24:30.838
The suspense is killing me.

24:30.840 --> 24:31.906
Abby?

24:33.142 --> 24:35.444
Is it Dearing?

24:36.312 --> 24:37.312
Okay...

24:37.314 --> 24:39.848
According
to the DNA results,

24:39.850 --> 24:42.017
we have a 50% match,

24:42.019 --> 24:44.753
which, given the severely
compromised

24:44.755 --> 24:46.288
condition of the remains,

24:46.290 --> 24:47.757
is closer
than I expected.

24:47.759 --> 24:49.024
It's him.

24:50.660 --> 24:52.694
You did it, Jethro.

24:52.696 --> 24:55.097
You got the bastard.

25:06.258 --> 25:09.025
(jackhammers, electric saws,
workers conversing)

25:18.935 --> 25:22.203
WORKER: We're finished with the
scaffolding here, all right?

25:22.205 --> 25:24.673
Still cleaning up.

25:24.675 --> 25:27.142
I cannot imagine the chaos
that this must have caused.

25:27.144 --> 25:31.413
Welcome back, Duck.
How you feel?

25:31.415 --> 25:33.882
Well, I count calories
like a ballet dancer.

25:33.884 --> 25:36.318
I "Sweat to the Oldies"
three times a week.

25:36.320 --> 25:39.487
And where I once kept
pace with the hare,

25:39.489 --> 25:41.289
I am now envious
of the tortoise.

25:41.291 --> 25:42.590
That is how I feel.

25:42.592 --> 25:44.626
Yeah, well, you're alive.

25:44.628 --> 25:47.729
Perhaps when I get back
to work.

25:47.731 --> 25:48.930
Well, welcome back,

25:48.932 --> 25:51.165
but not just yet.
Doctor's orders.

25:51.167 --> 25:53.434
So I have been told.

25:53.436 --> 25:56.537
I suppose congratulations are
in order on the elimination

25:56.539 --> 25:58.940
of the man who was
responsible for all this.

25:58.942 --> 26:01.743
Looks like he took
his own life.

26:01.745 --> 26:04.645
There is some doubt?

26:06.014 --> 26:10.986
I see. So this invitation to tea

26:10.988 --> 26:12.988
isn't strictly
a social one then?

26:12.990 --> 26:18.093
You think your doctor would
mind you giving some advice?

26:18.095 --> 26:20.563
Only if I tell him.

26:20.565 --> 26:22.564
McGEE: <i>Penny, you don't have</i>
<i>to come home early.</i>

26:22.566 --> 26:25.801
No, I know it's just a cruise,
but you're in Europe.

26:25.803 --> 26:28.303
I'm fine.

26:28.305 --> 26:29.971
No, I'm not gonna call Dad.

26:29.973 --> 26:31.873
Because there's
no reason to.

26:31.875 --> 26:34.943
(ship's horn blows)

26:34.945 --> 26:37.546
Why did I tell my grandmother
about the explosion?

26:37.548 --> 26:39.781
Ah, she's worried.
It's normal.

26:39.783 --> 26:42.151
Nothing's normal
about my grandmother.

26:42.153 --> 26:44.854
Listen, Penny, I love you,
but I gotta go, okay?

26:44.856 --> 26:46.622
I'll call you back later.

26:46.624 --> 26:48.324
Yes, yes, I promise.

26:50.093 --> 26:54.497
You know, Tim, maybe calling
your dad would be beneficial.

26:54.499 --> 26:55.831
For who?

26:55.833 --> 26:59.135
The admiral and I only talk
when absolutely necessary.

26:59.137 --> 27:00.871
Besides, things are getting
back on track around here.

27:00.873 --> 27:02.873
Why would I want
to open up that can of worms?

27:02.875 --> 27:07.912
Yeah. I'm still pretty freaked
out about what happened here.

27:07.914 --> 27:12.517
But I've got Breena to talk
to when I go home at night.

27:12.519 --> 27:14.720
Only thing worse than being
scared is being scared alone.

27:14.722 --> 27:17.189
Either one of you Gibbs?

27:17.191 --> 27:19.358
Maybe in my dreams. (laughs)

27:20.393 --> 27:21.693
I'm sorry.

27:21.695 --> 27:23.562
Is there something
we can help you with?

27:23.564 --> 27:26.597
I'm Joann Dearing,
Harper's sister-in-law.

27:26.599 --> 27:28.599
I've been away
on business.

27:28.601 --> 27:32.503
I was told Special Agent
Gibbs wanted to see me.

27:34.039 --> 27:36.007
Been trying to
reach you, Joann.

27:36.009 --> 27:38.642
I've been traveling.

27:38.644 --> 27:41.411
London, mostly.
Berlin. Hong Kong.

27:41.413 --> 27:44.782
I'm a personal assistant.

27:44.784 --> 27:48.018
Just took a job
after many years.

27:48.020 --> 27:50.554
Why are you still
investigating?

27:50.556 --> 27:53.057
Oh, I'm just tying up
loose ends.

27:53.059 --> 27:55.693
No one claimed the body.

27:57.430 --> 28:01.566
Well, if Victoria didn't,
I doubt anybody else will.

28:03.869 --> 28:06.838
Tell me about the Dearings.

28:06.840 --> 28:08.239
They're a complicated
family.

28:08.241 --> 28:11.209
Political,
steeped in Southern tradition.

28:11.211 --> 28:15.213
That was before.
What about now?

28:15.215 --> 28:17.882
Everything changed
with Evan's death.

28:17.884 --> 28:23.955
My, uh, husband Lawrence
was Harper's brother.

28:23.957 --> 28:26.223
Your husband passed away.

28:26.225 --> 28:29.928
Four months ago
from a heart attack.

28:29.930 --> 28:32.597
He was a decent man,
a terrific doctor.

28:32.599 --> 28:37.202
Obituary doesn't list
a burial site.

28:37.204 --> 28:38.336
The Dearings have

28:38.338 --> 28:41.105
a family plot in Augusta,
a private cemetery.

28:43.075 --> 28:50.114
Hmm. So Harper had access
to his brother's remains?

28:50.116 --> 28:51.515
Yes.

28:51.517 --> 28:54.852
But why would that matter?

28:56.855 --> 28:58.289
(doors open)

28:58.291 --> 28:59.457
Dr. Mallard...

28:59.459 --> 29:03.628
I've been holding onto
the body for the family.

29:03.630 --> 29:05.430
No one
ever contacted us.

29:05.432 --> 29:07.332
Claiming the remains

29:07.334 --> 29:10.769
of wanted men has always been
taboo, Mr. Palmer.

29:10.771 --> 29:13.239
Forensic historians
have traditionally shown

29:13.241 --> 29:15.875
more interest in their bodies
than family members.

29:15.877 --> 29:18.945
That's why John Wilkes Booth
has always been

29:18.947 --> 29:20.180
a fascination for me.

29:20.182 --> 29:22.749
You see, his body...
Duck,

29:22.751 --> 29:24.651
you're not here, remember?

29:24.653 --> 29:26.853
Yes, but I am alive.

29:26.855 --> 29:30.056
And, until I am embalmed
and buried,

29:30.058 --> 29:31.358
there will be stories to tell.

29:31.360 --> 29:33.961
And I look forward
to telling them.

29:33.963 --> 29:35.362
As Agent Gibbs
already knows,

29:35.364 --> 29:37.698
due to the force
of the blast,

29:37.700 --> 29:40.167
the intense heat, there wasn't
much left to work with.

29:40.169 --> 29:42.636
But I did manage to find
some flesh for Abby's DNA test.

29:42.638 --> 29:44.639
Wait a second.

29:44.641 --> 29:47.708
Ducky, remember what I said.
Stay in the backseat.

29:47.710 --> 29:50.344
Yes, I don't wish
to abuse my welcome,

29:50.346 --> 29:51.746
but you're about to get

29:51.748 --> 29:53.914
some of that free advice
you asked me for.

29:53.916 --> 29:57.084
PALMER:
I could get in trouble for this.

29:59.087 --> 30:00.387
Call a cop.

30:00.389 --> 30:02.590
PALMER: I'm guessing that broke
during the explosion?

30:02.592 --> 30:05.259
And you'd be guessing
incorrectly.

30:05.261 --> 30:07.728
Notice the minute fractures.

30:07.730 --> 30:08.996
CPR?

30:08.998 --> 30:12.232
Yeah, this man suffered
a significant cardiac event

30:12.234 --> 30:13.534
prior to his death.

30:13.536 --> 30:17.138
Paramedics tried
to revive him,

30:17.140 --> 30:19.940
but unlike yours truly,
they did not succeed.

30:19.942 --> 30:23.311
Harper Dearing didn't have
any history of heart problems.

30:23.313 --> 30:26.648
No, but he had a brother who
just died of a heart attack.

30:27.950 --> 30:30.085
The DNA was close enough
to be Harper Dearing.

30:30.087 --> 30:31.886
Not exact.

30:31.888 --> 30:33.288
Brothers, Mr. Palmer.

30:33.290 --> 30:36.224
If Harper Dearing put

30:36.226 --> 30:38.326
his sibling's remains
in that car...

30:38.328 --> 30:39.861
He's still alive.

30:39.863 --> 30:41.596
Ducky, go home.

30:41.598 --> 30:43.865
<i>From what I can see, Gibbs,</i>

30:43.867 --> 30:46.301
I think the car was rigged
to heat the dead body,

30:46.303 --> 30:48.136
giving the illusion
that Dearing was inside.

30:48.138 --> 30:49.371
What about the bomb.

30:49.373 --> 30:51.206
Classic thermite.

30:51.208 --> 30:52.207
And his cell signal only looked

30:52.209 --> 30:53.608
like it was coming
from inside the car.

30:53.610 --> 30:55.010
Ziva, call Fornell.

30:55.012 --> 30:58.112
Tell him we need a nationwide
BOLO back out on Harper Dearing.

30:58.114 --> 31:00.814
Boss, isn't Dearing dead?

31:00.816 --> 31:01.782
Nope.

31:01.784 --> 31:03.150
Then who was in the car?

31:03.152 --> 31:05.753
Lawrence Dearing,

31:05.755 --> 31:07.021
Harper's dead brother.

31:07.023 --> 31:10.424
Ooh, grave robbery.
Sweet.

31:10.426 --> 31:12.927
McGee, try to track Dearing
using his old cell numbers.

31:15.531 --> 31:19.300
Disconnected.
Searching for new accounts

31:19.302 --> 31:20.501
with similar
calling patterns.

31:20.503 --> 31:21.669
DiNozzo, Joann Dearing's
bank accounts.

31:21.671 --> 31:25.173
The fiery 50 who was
just in here? On it, boss.

31:25.175 --> 31:28.410
Agent Fornell asked me
to convey this message.

31:28.412 --> 31:30.479
"Are you freaking kidding me?

31:30.481 --> 31:31.914
BOLO's out."

31:31.916 --> 31:35.084
Whoa-oa. Looks like
Joann Dearing just found

31:35.086 --> 31:36.853
some spare change
under the sofa cushions.

31:36.855 --> 31:38.888
How much?

31:38.890 --> 31:40.490
$250,000.

31:43.494 --> 31:46.563
McGee, switch gears.
Run Joann's cell.

31:46.565 --> 31:47.898
Already on it.

31:47.900 --> 31:49.800
The day after Harper Dearing's
car exploded,

31:49.802 --> 31:52.536
Joann received several calls
from a disposable phone

31:52.538 --> 31:53.870
somewhere in the Appalachians.

31:53.872 --> 31:55.038
Put it up.

31:58.943 --> 32:01.744
She also bought gas
using a credit card

32:01.746 --> 32:04.881
in the small town
of Martinsburg, West Virginia.

32:04.883 --> 32:06.182
That's the same area, boss:

32:06.184 --> 32:08.284
the cell calls,
the gas station...

32:08.286 --> 32:12.255
Get Joann Dearing
back in here now.

32:18.763 --> 32:19.930
GIBBS:
Have a look.

32:19.932 --> 32:22.032
Agent Gibbs, I don't need

32:22.034 --> 32:24.000
to look at more pictures
of injured sailors.

32:24.002 --> 32:25.235
Open it.

32:31.575 --> 32:33.977
What is all this?

32:33.979 --> 32:36.412
When was the last time
you saw Harper Dearing?

32:36.414 --> 32:38.214
And don't say
at your husband's funeral.

32:38.216 --> 32:41.684
Look, I know he did a lot
of horrible things,

32:41.686 --> 32:44.888
but he also supported us
when my husband needed it.

32:44.890 --> 32:48.359
We know that you recently
took a trip to West Virginia.

32:48.361 --> 32:50.961
We know that Harper Dearing
gave you money.

32:50.963 --> 32:53.064
We think that you spoke
with him.

32:53.066 --> 32:55.332
I-I-I can't remember.

32:55.334 --> 32:56.767
I mean, it's possible.

32:56.769 --> 32:57.935
Is this some kind of joke

32:57.937 --> 32:59.570
to you?
No.

32:59.572 --> 33:02.206
No.

33:02.208 --> 33:05.576
(sobbing)

33:05.578 --> 33:07.945
Evan.

33:07.947 --> 33:11.850
The flag from Evan's funeral.

33:11.852 --> 33:14.052
(sighs)

33:14.054 --> 33:15.820
Harper couldn't bear
to bring it home.

33:15.822 --> 33:17.555
It was too painful.

33:17.557 --> 33:20.225
We kept it safe for him.

33:20.227 --> 33:23.361
We did for a long time.

33:25.130 --> 33:27.865
After Harper was reported dead,

33:27.867 --> 33:30.068
I came home from work.

33:33.038 --> 33:35.206
There he was,

33:35.208 --> 33:38.009
just...

33:38.011 --> 33:40.945
standing in my living room,

33:40.947 --> 33:44.048
holding Evan's flag.

33:44.050 --> 33:47.151
I guess he didn't think
I'd be there.

33:47.153 --> 33:49.086
He paid you to keep quiet?

33:49.088 --> 33:51.321
He wanted to help me.

33:51.323 --> 33:53.690
I didn't know
he faked his death.

33:53.692 --> 33:56.927
I didn't know Lawrence,

33:56.929 --> 33:58.394
his body,

33:58.396 --> 34:01.463
was involved.

34:01.465 --> 34:05.067
Look, I'm barely keeping
afloat right now.

34:05.069 --> 34:07.736
I needed the money.

34:07.738 --> 34:10.072
Where is he?

34:10.074 --> 34:12.274
Please.

34:12.275 --> 34:14.476
Where is Harper Dearing?

34:25.021 --> 34:26.955
Federal agents!

34:26.956 --> 34:28.322
FBI!

34:32.928 --> 34:35.597
Clear, boss.

34:35.599 --> 34:37.065
I'm clear as well.

34:37.067 --> 34:39.600
Well, well, well,
look at this.

34:49.710 --> 34:52.110
Looks this is where Dearing
planned everything.

34:52.112 --> 34:53.246
ZIVA:
The bombs, too.

34:53.248 --> 34:54.313
It's all just sitting here.

34:54.315 --> 34:56.181
Now, Dearing wanted us
to see this.

34:56.184 --> 34:58.251
He wanted us to know
he was finished.

34:58.253 --> 34:59.786
So, where is he?

34:59.788 --> 35:02.121
Thermal scan puts him in here
as little as an hour ago.

35:02.123 --> 35:03.889
But nobody saw him leave.

35:03.891 --> 35:05.925
(thump)
TONY: Hey, boss.

35:19.505 --> 35:22.207
It's an old moonshine
Prohibition run.

35:22.209 --> 35:25.778
Probably goes all the way
to the state border.

35:38.905 --> 35:41.106
(door closes)

35:49.082 --> 35:50.750
Are you building something?

35:50.752 --> 35:52.952
Yeah.

35:54.121 --> 35:55.721
I need a bigger basement.

35:55.723 --> 35:58.257
I might need a hobby.

35:58.259 --> 36:00.026
You got kids, Leon.

36:00.028 --> 36:02.895
They're coming out just fine.

36:03.731 --> 36:05.632
You called?

36:05.634 --> 36:07.367
Yeah.

36:07.369 --> 36:11.004
Forensics linked everything
in the farmhouse to Dearing.

36:11.006 --> 36:12.472
Dogs swept the tunnel.

36:12.474 --> 36:14.507
They missed him by 20 minutes.

36:14.509 --> 36:16.610
FBI and Homeland Security?

36:16.612 --> 36:19.913
Working on leads. Why?

36:27.789 --> 36:30.491
I got an idea.

36:32.293 --> 36:34.128
You're not gonna like it.

36:34.130 --> 36:36.663
Try me.

36:36.665 --> 36:38.999
I go.

36:39.001 --> 36:41.001
Alone.

36:42.871 --> 36:44.572
You're right; I don't.

36:44.574 --> 36:46.641
Leon,

36:46.643 --> 36:49.744
this isn't about bombs
and ships anymore.

36:51.881 --> 36:54.382
Dearing knows

36:54.384 --> 36:56.184
what he did.

36:56.186 --> 36:59.487
And he knows what
has to happen next.

36:59.489 --> 37:02.357
And you think you're the man
for the job?

37:02.359 --> 37:05.293
We both made decisions.

37:05.295 --> 37:07.895
We both made mistakes.

37:07.897 --> 37:10.064
Dearing knows that.

37:12.067 --> 37:14.235
He's waiting for me.

37:14.237 --> 37:16.404
Where?

37:16.406 --> 37:20.308
The house where he
and Victoria raised Evan.

37:20.310 --> 37:22.077
And you know this because...

37:22.079 --> 37:24.312
Because that's where I would go.

37:24.314 --> 37:27.382
That's where the memories are.

37:27.384 --> 37:29.818
The ones...

37:29.820 --> 37:31.921
that are important,
anyway.

37:31.923 --> 37:35.491
The ones that
Dearing holds on to.

37:35.493 --> 37:38.461
He wants these to be his last.

37:38.463 --> 37:42.498
There's no way
I should let you do this.

37:42.500 --> 37:46.002
No, you shouldn't.

37:46.004 --> 37:49.104
But I am.

38:00.218 --> 38:02.619
For the record,

38:02.621 --> 38:04.621
if anything should happen...

38:04.623 --> 38:07.057
Kill him.

38:07.059 --> 38:09.593
Glad to.

38:22.409 --> 38:23.676
ZIVA:
Do not give it to him.

38:23.678 --> 38:25.744
McGee, he's being
a stubborn fool.

38:29.215 --> 38:32.151
Okay, but you're definitely
being stubborn.

38:32.153 --> 38:34.486
McGee.

38:34.488 --> 38:35.988
It's the address.

38:35.990 --> 38:38.857
You sure you don't want
any company?

38:38.859 --> 38:40.893
Yeah.

38:40.895 --> 38:42.961
Vance knows?

38:42.963 --> 38:45.097
Yeah, he does, every bit of it.

38:45.099 --> 38:46.831
This is infuriating.

38:46.833 --> 38:48.500
Ziva is upset.

38:53.739 --> 38:54.872
What's a four-letter word

38:54.874 --> 38:56.774
for surviving
a terrorist attack?

38:56.776 --> 38:58.376
Luck.

38:58.378 --> 39:01.679
Watch out for each other.

39:04.382 --> 39:06.450
(elevator bell dings)

39:06.452 --> 39:08.853
(clears throat)

39:18.230 --> 39:20.432

39:33.779 --> 39:35.513
EVAN (on tape):
Hi, Mom and Dad.

39:35.515 --> 39:38.115
This is my sixth day at sea.

39:38.117 --> 39:40.417
I finally feel
like I got my sea legs.

39:40.419 --> 39:42.753
Mess has been better
than I expected.

39:42.755 --> 39:45.723
It's amazing how many green
vegetables they serve on a ship.

39:45.725 --> 39:49.660
My bunkmate, Roger, says he
never sleep as well at home

39:49.662 --> 39:51.429
as he does at sea.

39:51.431 --> 39:54.399
My C.O. is intimidating,
but he's fair.

39:54.401 --> 39:56.501
His given pretty much all
the newbies a nickname so far.

39:56.503 --> 39:57.769
DEARING:
Turn that off, will you?

39:57.771 --> 40:00.172
You know, I'm just trying
to keep my head down.

40:00.174 --> 40:02.641
I'm finally being able to find
my way around the ship.

40:02.643 --> 40:04.276
Evan used to send
us cassette tapes

40:04.278 --> 40:07.879
to listen to,
see how he was doing.

40:07.881 --> 40:09.948
Please.

40:09.950 --> 40:12.417
I'll be in touch as...
(tape stops)

40:14.186 --> 40:17.022
Trying to make you
a nice cup of coffee.

40:17.024 --> 40:18.657
I know you like it, but this...

40:18.659 --> 40:19.691
(chuckles)

40:19.693 --> 40:23.028
This machine is impossible.

40:23.030 --> 40:25.630
How about something stronger?

40:27.700 --> 40:30.835
I'm glad you came, Gibbs.

40:30.837 --> 40:34.472
I was hoping you'd figure
it out eventually.

40:36.008 --> 40:38.576
The house where Evan was born.

40:38.578 --> 40:42.647
I'm sure you have similar
feelings for Kelly's home.

41:06.873 --> 41:09.641
No.

41:09.643 --> 41:13.311
You and I are a lot alike,
you know.

41:13.313 --> 41:17.049
I know what you did
for your family.

41:17.051 --> 41:19.385
You made one decision;
I made another.

41:19.387 --> 41:21.821
Both did what we had to do.

41:24.792 --> 41:27.894
You have a job to do, Gibbs.

41:32.533 --> 41:34.368
I've done mine.

41:37.205 --> 41:38.972
Do I have regrets?

41:38.974 --> 41:41.241
Yeah.

41:41.243 --> 41:43.310
Some.

41:43.312 --> 41:45.479
But not all.

41:49.250 --> 41:51.818
Maybe things happen
for a reason.
