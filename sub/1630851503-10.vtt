WEBVTT

00:03.237 --> 00:04.205
Okay, okay!

00:04.238 --> 00:05.839
Speech, speech!
Yeah!

00:05.873 --> 00:08.042
You made the dean's list.
Let's hear something smart.

00:08.076 --> 00:09.910
Okay, chill.

00:09.943 --> 00:13.013
I was having a really hard time,
I was barely getting C's,

00:13.047 --> 00:15.349
but I stayed focused,
and my boyfriend, Logan,

00:15.383 --> 00:17.151
helped me a ton, and then --
I don't know --

00:17.185 --> 00:18.852
something just clicked,
and I made the dean's list.

00:18.886 --> 00:19.920
So, yay for me.

00:19.953 --> 00:21.489
Hey, hey!
Yay, you!

00:21.522 --> 00:25.259
And -- And he did it at
a magnet school, no less, huh?

00:25.293 --> 00:27.661
You know, the girl
that does my hair

00:27.695 --> 00:29.730
has a boy
in magnet school.

00:29.763 --> 00:33.267
The problem is, he keeps
sticking to the refrigerator.

00:33.301 --> 00:35.336
Stop right now.
Don't anybody laugh at him.

00:35.369 --> 00:37.004
We should've never
bought you that toilet paper

00:37.037 --> 00:39.006
with the jokes on it.

00:39.039 --> 00:41.675
It makes going to the bathroom
fun again.

00:41.709 --> 00:44.178
I really appreciate
all the presents,

00:44.212 --> 00:46.714
but, please, no more
Bass Pro Shop gift cards.

00:46.747 --> 00:48.416
I know it's a re-gift,
even when you cross out

00:48.449 --> 00:50.017
"Happy Birthday, Dan."

00:50.050 --> 00:53.987
Hey, I stood in line to
get that for you.

00:54.955 --> 00:58.426
Okay. This baby-shower cake
was the only thing

00:58.459 --> 01:00.861
the bakery had left,
so I had to improvise.

01:00.894 --> 01:02.463
Congratulations!

01:02.496 --> 01:04.265
It's a genius!

01:04.298 --> 01:05.599
Hey!

01:06.767 --> 01:09.069
Hey, Mark.
Nice job, dude.

01:09.103 --> 01:10.804
Oh. Hey, Harris.

01:10.838 --> 01:13.073
I meant to call you,
but I just didn't want

01:13.107 --> 01:14.742
to bother you now that
you're living at Aldo's house.

01:14.775 --> 01:15.743
Don't apologize.

01:15.776 --> 01:16.777
I know
you didn't invite me

01:16.810 --> 01:18.379
'cause you thought
I'd be jealous,

01:18.412 --> 01:20.914
but I love my little brother,
and I'm happy when he does good.

01:20.948 --> 01:22.383
I know that.
And who knows?

01:22.416 --> 01:23.917
Maybe if Mark
does really good,

01:23.951 --> 01:25.986
you'll let him decide who
he wants to fall in love with

01:26.019 --> 01:27.621
and won't throw him
out of the house

01:27.655 --> 01:29.157
like a dog
who crapped on the rug.

01:29.190 --> 01:31.425
Anyways, that's all
I wanted to say.

01:31.459 --> 01:33.194
Love you all. Goodbye.

01:36.797 --> 01:38.399
Want me to ask her
to come back?

01:38.432 --> 01:41.735
No, let her save a little
something for Mother's Day.

01:41.769 --> 01:44.238
Well, hey, let's get this
cake going, huh?

01:44.272 --> 01:47.275
Now, everyone who's ever been
on a dean's list goes first.

01:47.308 --> 01:49.843
Ooh! Ooh!
Don't even try.

01:49.877 --> 01:52.780
Hey! The dean said I was
on his list.

01:52.813 --> 01:54.948
He just didn't say
which list.

01:54.982 --> 01:56.317
Give it to Grandpa.
I'm kinda full.

01:56.350 --> 01:57.485
I'll have some later.

01:57.518 --> 01:59.920
What? How can you be full?
You didn't eat lunch.

01:59.953 --> 02:02.990
I don't know. Maybe I'm just
so excited, I'm not hungry.

02:03.023 --> 02:04.592
That's not
a Brussels sprout, son.

02:04.625 --> 02:06.093
That's cake.

02:06.126 --> 02:08.362
You don't eat cake
'cause you're hungry.

02:08.396 --> 02:11.832
You eat it 'cause that's all
you got until there's beer.

02:13.033 --> 02:15.303
You haven't been eating much
lately. Are you okay?

02:15.336 --> 02:17.171
Didn't you hear what I said?
I'm not hungry.

02:18.306 --> 02:21.309
Uh, he's just tired
from studying so much.

02:21.342 --> 02:23.143
And we've been eating
a lot of pizza

02:23.177 --> 02:24.312
and hot dogs
and stuff.

02:24.345 --> 02:26.947
You know, brain food.

02:26.980 --> 02:28.982
Well, maybe next birthday,
I should give you a gift card

02:29.016 --> 02:31.385
to a pizza place,
and you can give that to him.

02:31.419 --> 02:33.887
I don't fish.
Let it go.

02:35.088 --> 02:37.124
Hey.
How did you get in here?

02:37.157 --> 02:38.459
You're not supposed
to be working.

02:38.492 --> 02:39.627
Came in the back.

02:39.660 --> 02:41.395
I wanted to try out
this cool leg scooter.

02:41.429 --> 02:43.464
Stew comin' at ya, Bill!

02:45.098 --> 02:47.568
Whoa!

02:47.601 --> 02:49.537
There, we got it.
There you go.

02:49.570 --> 02:51.472
You didn't need
a full bowl anyway.

02:51.505 --> 02:54.742
Those jeans are screaming,
"Help me!"

02:54.775 --> 02:56.810
I know why
you're doing this.

02:56.844 --> 02:59.813
Neville and Helen are coming by
to get Logan,

02:59.847 --> 03:01.048
and you don't want him
to know

03:01.081 --> 03:02.883
that you're not
as fit as his ex.

03:02.916 --> 03:05.152
This has got nothing
to do with Helen.

03:05.185 --> 03:07.154
I might be a couple
of years older than her,

03:07.187 --> 03:09.257
but I could still
kick her ass.

03:09.290 --> 03:12.526
I mean, if somebody held her
still and I could roll into her.

03:13.727 --> 03:15.896
Helen! Neville.

03:15.929 --> 03:18.098
Wow. Look at you walking
around already.

03:18.131 --> 03:20.368
Yeah, right back at work.
Can't keep me down.

03:20.401 --> 03:22.102
No, but I think your
basketball days are over.

03:22.135 --> 03:23.837
Next time you fall,
I might not be there

03:23.871 --> 03:25.205
to carry you
to the sofa.

03:25.239 --> 03:27.375
Well, technically,
we were still playing.

03:27.408 --> 03:28.442
You just scooped me up

03:28.476 --> 03:31.011
so I wouldn't keep dunking
on your ass.

03:31.044 --> 03:33.514
Isn't it a little quick
for you to be back at work?

03:33.547 --> 03:35.283
Oh, no, ankle's
better than before.

03:35.316 --> 03:36.684
Watch this.

03:36.717 --> 03:37.885
Moonwalk.

03:37.918 --> 03:40.020
Whoa, pardon me.

03:40.053 --> 03:41.989
What'd I eat this morning?

03:42.890 --> 03:44.525
What are you doing?

03:44.558 --> 03:46.960
She's hiding the scooter
because she doesn't want you

03:46.994 --> 03:49.196
to feel sorry for her
or try to help her.

03:49.229 --> 03:52.266
She's what the doctors
call "an idiot."

03:52.300 --> 03:54.702
Is this why you've been
avoiding me the last few days?

03:54.735 --> 03:57.137
I haven't been avoiding you.
I just haven't needed you.

03:57.170 --> 03:59.139
I can take care of myself.

03:59.172 --> 04:00.774
Ready to go.

04:00.808 --> 04:02.142
Okay.

04:02.175 --> 04:03.644
Please,
go home and rest.

04:03.677 --> 04:05.212
I'll stop by
tomorrow afternoon.

04:05.245 --> 04:06.580
Oh, I thought
we were hiking.

04:06.614 --> 04:08.048
Oh, right.

04:08.081 --> 04:09.650
I'm taking them to
the Michigan dunes tomorrow.

04:09.683 --> 04:11.319
Huh?
Well, I can hike!

04:11.352 --> 04:13.654
Look, I don't need
this stupid thing.

04:13.687 --> 04:15.423
Watch, I'm standing
without it.

04:18.492 --> 04:20.494
Oh, there's something on
the floor I got to get.

04:22.296 --> 04:23.897
Don't look!

04:23.931 --> 04:25.799
Just trust me --
she's fine.

04:26.834 --> 04:28.902
All right.
See you later.

04:28.936 --> 04:30.371
Bye-bye!

04:32.306 --> 04:35.275
<i>Captions by VITAC</i> --

05:09.710 --> 05:12.480
Did anybody notice
there's a fully cooked lasagna

05:12.513 --> 05:14.348
in the fridge that wasn't there
last night?

05:14.382 --> 05:17.284
The only person here
who makes lasagna is Louise,

05:17.317 --> 05:18.886
and she's still on tour.

05:18.919 --> 05:21.288
There has been a rash
of Italian chefs

05:21.321 --> 05:23.791
breaking in to houses
and cooking meals.

05:23.824 --> 05:25.626
But that's mostly
been ravioli,

05:25.659 --> 05:27.828
so I don't think
it's related.

05:27.861 --> 05:30.330
Well, hopefully we're in
the middle of a turf war

05:30.364 --> 05:33.333
and the cannoli gang breaks in
to send a message.

05:33.867 --> 05:35.536
I see you guys
found my lasagna.

05:35.569 --> 05:36.704
Enjoy.

05:36.737 --> 05:38.539
Wait.
When did you make that?

05:38.572 --> 05:39.540
The middle of the night?

05:39.573 --> 05:41.141
I had trouble
falling asleep.

05:41.174 --> 05:42.910
Probably too much coffee
while I was studying.

05:42.943 --> 05:45.078
And I felt bad about
snapping at everybody

05:45.112 --> 05:47.180
at lunch yesterday,
so lasagna.

05:48.348 --> 05:52.319
Okay. I think we've got
an eating disorder.

05:52.352 --> 05:54.488
But he didn't eat it.
He made it for us to eat.

05:54.522 --> 05:58.358
Okay, I think we've got
a cooking disorder.

05:58.392 --> 06:02.329
Finally, somebody in this family
has a disorder we can use.

06:02.362 --> 06:04.197
You think
there's a problem?

06:04.231 --> 06:07.435
First he's not eating,
and now he's not sleeping.

06:07.468 --> 06:09.169
And Mark hates coffee.

06:09.202 --> 06:10.938
Oh. He hates <i>our</i> coffee.

06:10.971 --> 06:12.773
He might like good coffee.

06:12.806 --> 06:15.443
I've seen this before,
when I was a truck driver.

06:15.476 --> 06:18.078
People up all night driving,
a little jumpy in the morning,

06:18.111 --> 06:19.913
no appetite.

06:19.947 --> 06:21.615
He's on the cocaine.

06:23.417 --> 06:25.018
He can't afford cocaine.

06:25.052 --> 06:28.321
If we pooled all of our money,
we could barely afford meth.

06:29.790 --> 06:31.659
Bitch took my coffee.

06:33.126 --> 06:35.529
Hey, I made you
some more coffee.

06:35.563 --> 06:36.897
If you didn't sleep,
you're gonna need it

06:36.930 --> 06:37.898
to get through school.

06:37.931 --> 06:39.366
Yeah, sure, thanks.

06:39.399 --> 06:42.035
I'll put it in my thermos
and drink it on the bus.

06:42.069 --> 06:44.438
Oh. Well, you better taste it
to make sure

06:44.472 --> 06:45.939
it's strong enough
for you.

06:45.973 --> 06:47.808
I'm sure it's fine.

06:47.841 --> 06:51.044
Well, you won't know
unless you taste it.

06:54.982 --> 06:56.617
Yep, that's
a good cup of coffee.

06:57.818 --> 06:59.887
All right,
we need to talk.

06:59.920 --> 07:02.222
You did not stay up
all night on coffee.

07:02.255 --> 07:03.957
You're not eating.
What's going on?

07:03.991 --> 07:06.126
Nothing.
Everything is fine.

07:06.159 --> 07:08.061
You know, Jackie thinks
you're on cocaine.

07:08.095 --> 07:10.130
Oh, my God.
It's not cocaine.

07:10.163 --> 07:11.999
Wait. So it --
it's something?

07:12.032 --> 07:14.001
Yes.
It's just pills for ADHD.

07:14.034 --> 07:15.168
It's not like drugs
or anything.

07:15.202 --> 07:17.104
Oh, my God.
Yes, that <i>is</i> drugs --

07:17.137 --> 07:19.907
for kids who have ADHD,
which you do not.

07:19.940 --> 07:21.274
Where did you get it?

07:21.308 --> 07:23.276
You're making a big deal
out of nothing.

07:23.310 --> 07:25.579
It's like my generation's
version of coffee.

07:25.613 --> 07:28.281
Yeah, your generation
also ate detergent pods.

07:28.315 --> 07:29.950
You're a bunch of idiots.

07:29.983 --> 07:32.620
Now give me the pills
and tell me where you got them.

07:32.653 --> 07:34.955
Please, I-I only take them
when I need them.

07:34.988 --> 07:36.256
And they're helping me.

07:36.289 --> 07:38.125
I was drowning
at this school,

07:38.158 --> 07:40.027
and now I'm on
the dean's list.

07:40.060 --> 07:41.829
Just let me keep taking them
till my midterm.

07:41.862 --> 07:45.198
No! Give me the pills now --
all of them.

07:45.232 --> 07:47.300
Okay, okay.

07:47.334 --> 07:48.802
Here.
Wow.

07:48.836 --> 07:50.137
A breath-mint tin?

07:50.170 --> 07:51.872
What would've happened
if I came in here

07:51.905 --> 07:53.641
and was looking for
a breath mint

07:53.674 --> 07:55.208
and took one of those?

07:55.242 --> 07:57.778
Well, you probably would have
been more focused and motivated

07:57.811 --> 07:59.847
and had your own house
and no credit-card debt.

08:01.248 --> 08:04.117
That's the drugs talking.

08:04.151 --> 08:06.153
You know,
I-I didn't fail in life

08:06.186 --> 08:07.955
because I didn't take
enough drugs.

08:07.988 --> 08:10.190
I failed because I'm not
very good at my profession

08:10.223 --> 08:12.325
and I'm not particularly
pleasant to be around.

08:17.164 --> 08:19.066
How's the pain been?
It's not bad.

08:19.099 --> 08:21.635
Nothing aspirin
and a little morphine shot

08:21.669 --> 08:24.371
directly into my spine
wouldn't take care of.

08:24.404 --> 08:26.974
I was hoping the swelling
would go down by now.

08:27.007 --> 08:28.475
Mm.
If you're gonna get better,

08:28.508 --> 08:29.977
you really need to
stay off your feet.

08:30.010 --> 08:31.812
Well, I'm a working woman,
Doc.

08:31.845 --> 08:34.147
If I stop, this country
will grind to a halt.

08:34.181 --> 08:37.084
So, what've you got
so I can go hiking?

08:37.117 --> 08:39.019
Oh, hiking?
What kind of job do you have?

08:39.052 --> 08:40.854
Forest ranger.
She's not a forest ranger.

08:40.888 --> 08:43.323
I start tomorrow.
She owns a sports bar.

08:43.356 --> 08:46.359
She just wants a painkiller
so she can keep her boyfriend

08:46.393 --> 08:48.662
from going on a hike alone
with his hot ex.

08:48.696 --> 08:50.598
Has the family impressed
on her

08:50.631 --> 08:52.165
that she needs
to take care of herself?

08:52.199 --> 08:54.167
Well, I certainly have.

08:54.201 --> 08:57.270
I know the importance
of taking care of yourself.

08:57.304 --> 08:59.607
That's why I work out
and eat right.

08:59.640 --> 09:01.675
How old
do you think I am?

09:01.709 --> 09:02.843
35?

09:02.876 --> 09:05.445
46.

09:05.478 --> 09:07.715
Really?
I know.

09:07.748 --> 09:09.917
You might want to present me
at a conference or something.

09:09.950 --> 09:11.218
I know.

09:11.251 --> 09:13.220
Uh, are you looking
for something?

09:13.253 --> 09:16.590
Huh? Me? No.
I'm just a curious person.

09:16.624 --> 09:18.391
You're not looking
for painkillers, are you?

09:18.425 --> 09:19.893
Just tell me
if I'm hot or cold.

09:19.927 --> 09:21.762
I gotta get off
this ankle.

09:21.795 --> 09:24.598
All the narcotics
are locked up, Ms. Harris.

09:24.632 --> 09:27.601
But I am gonna give you
prescription-strength ibuprofen.

09:27.635 --> 09:28.802
Ibuprofen?

09:28.836 --> 09:31.138
Come on, Doc,
load me up.

09:31.171 --> 09:34.441
Let's clear Jackie
for takeoff.

09:34.474 --> 09:36.877
You just have to understand
you can't rush this.

09:36.910 --> 09:39.079
At your age,
everything heals slower.

09:39.112 --> 09:40.313
"At my age"?

09:40.347 --> 09:42.149
What are --

09:42.182 --> 09:43.483
You talking to me?

09:43.516 --> 09:44.952
Well, he wasn't
talking to me.

09:44.985 --> 09:46.820
He thought I was 29.

09:48.521 --> 09:50.157
You're not a kid anymore,
Ms. Harris.

09:50.190 --> 09:52.660
The -- The body works
differently at your age.

09:52.693 --> 09:53.994
Quit saying that.

09:54.027 --> 09:55.395
I don't even want
anything anymore.

09:55.428 --> 09:56.797
Come on, Becky,
let's go.

09:56.830 --> 10:01.635
Uh, by the way, um,
I left my cell number,

10:01.669 --> 10:03.270
so if you need to
check up on her

10:03.303 --> 10:06.674
or you just are having
some kind of...

10:06.707 --> 10:08.441
loneliness emergency --

10:08.475 --> 10:09.643
Beck-ay!

10:14.314 --> 10:15.615
Gimme all your 9s.

10:15.649 --> 10:17.517
Mm, go fish.

10:17.550 --> 10:19.319
How's Jackie's foot?

10:19.352 --> 10:21.288
Oh,
her foot's coming along,

10:21.321 --> 10:23.456
but the doctor used
the phrase "at your age,"

10:23.490 --> 10:25.592
and that's gonna take
a while to heal.

10:25.625 --> 10:27.527
Mm.
She looks so good,

10:27.560 --> 10:29.296
we left her unprepared
for this moment.

10:29.329 --> 10:30.664
This is our fault.

10:30.698 --> 10:32.800
I mean, how hard is it
to take a little time every day

10:32.833 --> 10:34.768
just to say,
"God, you're old"?

10:34.802 --> 10:37.604
You're right, and I won't make
the same mistake with you two.

10:37.637 --> 10:39.973
A little less time
in the sun, girls.

10:40.007 --> 10:42.943
I don't think
<i>I</i> have to worry.

10:42.976 --> 10:45.545
Did I mention the doctor
was flirting with me?

10:45.578 --> 10:47.114
Careful.

10:47.147 --> 10:49.516
Didn't you say recovering
addicts have to wait a full year

10:49.549 --> 10:51.952
before starting
any relationships?

10:51.985 --> 10:54.454
No, not if it's a doctor.

10:54.487 --> 10:57.290
Doctors and billionaires
are exempt.

10:57.324 --> 10:59.827
Hmm. Just watch out if you
get involved with a guy

10:59.860 --> 11:01.829
who comes with
a prescription pad.

11:01.862 --> 11:05.165
I'm a booze-hound,
not a pill-head like your son.

11:05.198 --> 11:06.800
Different rules.

11:06.834 --> 11:09.136
Hey, he gave me all the pills,
I told you.

11:09.169 --> 11:11.538
It's over.
Oh, man.

11:11.571 --> 11:13.140
How many times
in high school

11:13.173 --> 11:15.642
did you give me
"all" your weed?

11:15.675 --> 11:18.378
Never, and now I'm gonna look
through Mark's backpack.

11:18.411 --> 11:19.646
Wait.

11:19.679 --> 11:21.514
Before you go any further,

11:21.548 --> 11:24.384
think about whether or not
you want to violate his privacy

11:24.417 --> 11:27.755
and destroy the trust you've
been building for a lifetime.

11:27.788 --> 11:29.757
Found it.

11:29.790 --> 11:32.259
Uh, I cannot believe
he lied to me.

11:32.292 --> 11:34.594
And these are Logan's.
Of course.

11:34.627 --> 11:38.431
What we need to do
is ask an expert

11:38.465 --> 11:41.902
what these pills can do to
somebody who doesn't need them.

11:41.935 --> 11:44.071
Now, I don't want anything
to happen to Mark,

11:44.104 --> 11:46.006
so I'm gonna change
into something tighter,

11:46.039 --> 11:49.209
put on some makeup, and FaceTime
that doctor I met today.

11:53.914 --> 11:55.115
Logan, out.

11:55.148 --> 11:56.616
Why?
What did he do?

11:56.649 --> 11:57.684
He gave you these.

11:57.717 --> 11:59.352
Oh, there they are.

11:59.386 --> 12:01.288
Uh, why were they in
your backpack, Mark?

12:01.321 --> 12:03.056
I was holding them for you,
Logan.

12:03.090 --> 12:05.092
I-I never said anything
about a backpack.

12:05.125 --> 12:06.426
Come on,
you're both on speed.

12:06.459 --> 12:08.428
You should be a lot
sharper than this.

12:08.461 --> 12:09.596
Sorry.

12:09.629 --> 12:10.931
See you later.

12:10.964 --> 12:12.399
No, you're not gonna
see him later.

12:12.432 --> 12:13.767
The next time you see him,
he's gonna be a fat,

12:13.801 --> 12:16.770
middle-aged man, married
to his female best friend.

12:16.804 --> 12:18.738
Oh, my God.
You're really doing this?

12:18.772 --> 12:20.407
You won't let me see
my boyfriend?

12:20.440 --> 12:22.109
You lied to me.
I had to.

12:22.142 --> 12:24.644
I can't compete at this school
without the pills.

12:24.677 --> 12:26.079
Well, then
stop competing.

12:26.113 --> 12:28.081
You don't have to be
at the top of your class.

12:28.115 --> 12:30.283
If you fall a little behind,
it's not the end of the world.

12:30.317 --> 12:31.919
Yes, it is.

12:31.952 --> 12:33.921
Finishing in the top 10%
of my school is the only chance

12:33.954 --> 12:36.089
I have to get a scholarship
to a good college.

12:36.123 --> 12:37.958
But you're not eating,
you're not sleeping --

12:37.991 --> 12:40.460
if you're already taking drugs
to get through high school,

12:40.493 --> 12:42.295
college is only gonna
be worse.

12:42.329 --> 12:44.497
You have got to find
another way, all right?

12:44.531 --> 12:47.000
You're a really smart kid,
and I know you'll catch up.

12:47.034 --> 12:48.401
No, I won't.

12:48.435 --> 12:50.170
You know that cake
Aunt Becky got me?

12:50.203 --> 12:53.306
Well, you didn't have a genius.
You just had a boy.

12:59.112 --> 13:00.780
Whatcha doing?

13:00.814 --> 13:03.516
Doing a deep dive on
Dr. Nash's Instagram.

13:03.550 --> 13:04.818
I was starting to think,

13:04.852 --> 13:07.620
"Why is a guy this great
still single?"

13:07.654 --> 13:09.356
That's exactly how
they start every podcast

13:09.389 --> 13:10.924
about a serial killer.

13:10.958 --> 13:12.425
He can't be
a serial killer.

13:12.459 --> 13:14.794
He has an adorable
Sheep-a-doodle and a boat.

13:14.828 --> 13:16.930
So far so good.
Any family?

13:16.964 --> 13:18.698
Both parents dead.

13:18.731 --> 13:21.201
No one to shame him for
marrying below his station.

13:21.234 --> 13:24.004
Promising.
Anything else?

13:24.037 --> 13:26.006
Okay, here we go.

13:26.039 --> 13:28.608
Civil War re-enactor.

13:28.641 --> 13:31.211
Hmm.
Not necessarily bad.

13:31.244 --> 13:32.812
Which side?

13:32.846 --> 13:35.248
Uh, Gryffindor.

13:36.083 --> 13:38.518
Here's a picture of him
with a broom between his legs

13:38.551 --> 13:40.687
running around a park.

13:40.720 --> 13:41.955
I'm so sorry.

13:41.989 --> 13:44.157
Ugh!

13:44.191 --> 13:45.358
Is Jackie here?

13:45.392 --> 13:46.960
She wanted to talk to me
about something.

13:46.994 --> 13:49.629
Jackie!
Neville's here!

13:49.662 --> 13:51.464
I want to see your expression
when she comes in,

13:51.498 --> 13:52.832
then we're outta here.

13:58.038 --> 14:01.241
Ha! Too good.
Let's go.

14:01.274 --> 14:04.077
Let's face it, Neville --
I'm old.

14:04.111 --> 14:07.280
I, uh -- I'm decaying
as we speak.

14:08.348 --> 14:11.218
What are you talking about?
You just hurt your ankle.

14:11.251 --> 14:13.353
No, it's much worse
than that.

14:13.386 --> 14:16.924
The doctor told me I'm not gonna
heal fast because of my age.

14:16.957 --> 14:19.259
And I never thought of myself
as old,

14:19.292 --> 14:22.695
but now I'm aware of all
the changes that are going on.

14:22.729 --> 14:25.899
I can barely see at night.
I'm shrinking.

14:25.933 --> 14:28.535
I don't think I hear
all that well anymore.

14:28.568 --> 14:30.437
You're responding to
everything I'm saying.

14:30.470 --> 14:32.572
Well, I must've learned
how to read lips.

14:32.605 --> 14:34.874
Exaggerate your vowels,
would ya?

14:34.908 --> 14:39.379
You are not old,
you are crazy.

14:39.412 --> 14:41.781
You deserve better, Neville.
You should go with Helen.

14:41.814 --> 14:44.851
Unlike me, she's got a lot of
good years left on her.

14:44.884 --> 14:46.753
I don't want
her good years.

14:46.786 --> 14:48.455
I want <i>your</i> good years.

14:48.488 --> 14:52.259
Well, you missed them!
You were 12!

14:52.292 --> 14:55.895
Look, I have to go to work,
but I will come by tonight,

14:55.929 --> 14:57.464
and we'll talk
more about this.

14:57.497 --> 14:59.732
Fine. If you can't find me,
look down,

14:59.766 --> 15:01.734
as I'll probably
be smaller.

15:09.142 --> 15:12.412
You still watching
the Flex Seal guy?

15:12.445 --> 15:13.813
Oh.

15:13.846 --> 15:16.816
I'll save you some time --
there's no plot twist.

15:16.849 --> 15:19.152
Nothing leaks.

15:19.186 --> 15:21.288
I'm not really watching.

15:21.321 --> 15:23.056
What's wrong?

15:23.090 --> 15:26.126
Mark's convinced himself
that he can't keep up

15:26.159 --> 15:29.429
at the magnet school
without the pills.

15:29.462 --> 15:31.231
Sounds like
a no-brainer.

15:31.264 --> 15:34.267
He's telling you he can't
handle it -- yank him out.

15:34.301 --> 15:37.170
Yeah, then I might be
killing his future.

15:37.204 --> 15:39.139
I think I'm just gonna
keep him in the school

15:39.172 --> 15:42.009
and hope he adjusts
to the workload.

15:42.042 --> 15:44.111
But I am gonna have to
watch him like a hawk.

15:44.144 --> 15:46.113
Well, what does
that even mean?

15:46.146 --> 15:48.115
You're gonna drug test him
every day?

15:48.148 --> 15:49.182
If I have to.

15:49.216 --> 15:50.483
That's a nice
bonding moment.

15:50.517 --> 15:52.652
I think Norman Rockwell
painted that.

15:52.685 --> 15:55.622
It's called
"A Specimen for Mother."

15:55.655 --> 15:57.690
I don't -- I don't know
what else to do.

15:57.724 --> 15:59.792
It's not like he was
doing it to get high.

15:59.826 --> 16:01.494
He just wants a shot
at a better life.

16:01.528 --> 16:03.796
Well, you can also say
a person is doing meth

16:03.830 --> 16:07.834
just to save time brushing
those difficult-to-clean teeth.

16:07.867 --> 16:09.702
But there's gotta be
a way of doing that

16:09.736 --> 16:12.139
where you don't
destroy yourself.

16:12.172 --> 16:14.441
You don't want him to end up
like your mother.

16:14.474 --> 16:16.976
Well, it's not
the same thing.

16:17.010 --> 16:19.112
God, this is hard.

16:19.146 --> 16:20.880
It is
when you love them.

16:20.913 --> 16:23.516
Well, you know,
there's gotta be some way

16:23.550 --> 16:25.518
that I can help him
get through that magnet school.

16:25.552 --> 16:27.820
I mean, I just can't
take it away from him.

16:29.189 --> 16:30.857
You're the mom.

16:31.991 --> 16:34.161
Oh, look -- the Flex Seal guy's
a giant now,

16:34.194 --> 16:36.296
patching up
the Hoover Dam.

16:36.329 --> 16:38.331
Why isn't this guy
running the country?

16:38.365 --> 16:41.201
Way more qualified
than that pillow guy.

16:45.572 --> 16:46.973
I'm back.

16:48.341 --> 16:51.711
Uh, why all
the copper bracelets?

16:51.744 --> 16:54.013
Oh, it's good
for the rheumatiz.

16:54.047 --> 16:56.216
I ordered one with my name
and address on it

16:56.249 --> 16:58.685
so people could return me
after I wander off.

17:00.453 --> 17:02.322
Okay.

17:02.355 --> 17:06.726
I think I figured out that this
is all about Helen.

17:06.759 --> 17:08.428
I told you that.

17:08.461 --> 17:10.097
Okay.

17:10.130 --> 17:12.732
That's where I got it.
Okay.

17:12.765 --> 17:17.104
Well, I did something that
I think will make you happy.

17:17.137 --> 17:19.406
I got a friend of mine
to hire Helen

17:19.439 --> 17:21.608
at a small-animal practice
downstate.

17:21.641 --> 17:24.844
She'll be closer to Logan when
he's in Oklahoma with his dad

17:24.877 --> 17:26.413
and farther away
from us.

17:26.446 --> 17:28.715
Oh, thank you!

17:28.748 --> 17:31.050
That does make me happy.

17:31.084 --> 17:33.286
Oh, and it straightened out
your Dowager's hump.

17:33.320 --> 17:35.588
Yeah, I might
have overreacted.

17:35.622 --> 17:37.290
I think it comes from
our age difference.

17:37.324 --> 17:39.759
I didn't think it bothered me,
but then Helen came along,

17:39.792 --> 17:42.028
and I was bothered.

17:42.061 --> 17:43.596
I get it.

17:43.630 --> 17:45.064
But if anything,

17:45.098 --> 17:47.134
you're the younger one
in this relationship.

17:47.167 --> 17:48.968
I mean, you drag me
out of the house,

17:49.001 --> 17:50.603
you push me
to be more active.

17:50.637 --> 17:52.071
I can barely
keep up with you.

17:52.105 --> 17:53.740
That was just an act
I was putting on

17:53.773 --> 17:55.208
because you're
younger than me.

17:55.242 --> 17:56.543
I don't want
to be active.

17:56.576 --> 18:00.313
I want to sit
and let myself go to hell.

18:00.347 --> 18:03.716
Well, me too.
Let's go to hell together.

18:03.750 --> 18:05.618
Oh,
that would be nice.

18:10.257 --> 18:12.125
I'm gonna
start to smell.

18:13.793 --> 18:16.463
I work with zoo animals.
I won't even notice.

18:16.496 --> 18:18.231
Aww.

18:20.867 --> 18:22.769
Figured you might
be hungry by now,

18:22.802 --> 18:24.337
so I brought you
a snack.

18:24.371 --> 18:26.105
Sorry, can't take time
to eat.

18:26.139 --> 18:28.107
Your son who can't keep up
has to kill himself

18:28.141 --> 18:29.276
to get that C.

18:29.309 --> 18:30.943
Yes, about that.

18:30.977 --> 18:33.813
I know I made a big deal about
you being on the dean's list,

18:33.846 --> 18:36.783
and I am sorry if I put
too much pressure on you,

18:36.816 --> 18:38.518
but we will figure
this out.

18:38.551 --> 18:39.786
Yeah, you work on that.

18:41.554 --> 18:43.590
How much coffee is
too much coffee?

18:43.623 --> 18:45.992
I feel dizzy and like
my heart's gonna explode.

18:46.025 --> 18:47.594
How much have you had?

18:47.627 --> 18:48.961
I don't know.
Like three of these.

18:48.995 --> 18:50.363
That's crazy, Mark.

18:50.397 --> 18:52.265
You can't drink
that much coffee.

18:52.299 --> 18:54.100
I've worked too hard
to just throw this away.

18:54.133 --> 18:56.803
I need something to stay up
all night so I can study.

18:58.004 --> 18:59.706
Your hands are shaking.

18:59.739 --> 19:01.040
Okay, that's it.
You're done.

19:01.073 --> 19:02.709
Don't take that.
I need that.

19:02.742 --> 19:04.110
I have to pass this class.

19:04.143 --> 19:06.012
No, you don't.
Why not?

19:07.547 --> 19:10.016
Because I'm pulling you out
of the magnet school

19:10.049 --> 19:11.518
and re-enrolling you
in public school.

19:11.551 --> 19:13.520
No! No way!
I can do this.

19:13.553 --> 19:15.188
I wouldn't have to drink
so much coffee

19:15.222 --> 19:16.956
if you just let me take
the stupid pills!

19:16.989 --> 19:18.458
Look at yourself.

19:18.491 --> 19:20.893
You're shaking,
and you're begging for pills.

19:20.927 --> 19:23.129
No school or grade
or scholarship

19:23.162 --> 19:24.464
is worth that,
all right?

19:24.497 --> 19:25.832
You're a smart kid.

19:25.865 --> 19:27.467
You're just not cut out
for this pace.

19:27.500 --> 19:28.968
You don't understand
the consequences,

19:29.001 --> 19:30.570
so I'm just making
a decision for you.

19:30.603 --> 19:32.639
I <i>do</i> understand
the consequences.

19:32.672 --> 19:34.907
You're dooming me to a life
of struggling like you guys.

19:34.941 --> 19:37.544
No, lots of kids
get into good colleges

19:37.577 --> 19:38.811
from public schools.

19:38.845 --> 19:40.847
And, yeah, we struggle,
but we're also happy.

19:40.880 --> 19:43.250
Is this your first day here?
Who's happy?

19:43.283 --> 19:46.018
I don't know,
but somebody's got to be.

19:46.052 --> 19:48.521
Your grandpa found Louise.

19:48.555 --> 19:50.290
That's about it.

19:51.458 --> 19:53.693
Fine.
Pull me out of the school.

19:54.627 --> 19:57.264
You know, Mark, you're gonna
succeed wherever you go.

19:57.297 --> 20:00.767
I will, just not the way
you want me to.

20:00.800 --> 20:03.603
I'm gonna do whatever
it takes to do better
than the rest of you.

20:03.636 --> 20:05.171
Nothing's gonna
get in my way.

20:05.204 --> 20:07.774
The rules no longer apply.
Oh, really?

20:07.807 --> 20:10.610
The rules <i>do</i> apply as long
as you're under my roof.

20:10.643 --> 20:12.178
I'm not gonna let you do
anything stupid,

20:12.211 --> 20:14.781
but if you do,
there will be consequences.

20:14.814 --> 20:17.550
Until you're 18, and then you
can be as stupid as you want,

20:17.584 --> 20:19.686
and if the Conners before you
are any indication,

20:19.719 --> 20:21.854
it's gonna be Nobel Prize
stupid.

20:21.888 --> 20:24.056
I hate you.
Then I'm doing my job.

20:27.394 --> 20:30.330
You were right, Mom. I did say
that to my kids one day.

20:33.733 --> 20:36.369
The noise is coming
from the trailer.

20:36.403 --> 20:39.406
I'm gonna open the door,
poke whatever's in there.

20:39.439 --> 20:41.708
When it comes
flying out at you,

20:41.741 --> 20:44.243
you catch it in the bag.

20:44.277 --> 20:46.045
I saw a guy do this
on the news.

20:46.078 --> 20:47.614
Did it work?

20:47.647 --> 20:49.916
They didn't show that part.
It was too graphic.

20:50.650 --> 20:52.652
Ready?
No!

20:53.252 --> 20:54.921
Aah!

20:54.954 --> 20:56.656
Ow!

20:58.124 --> 20:59.926
We're gonna need
a bigger bag.

21:00.793 --> 21:02.562
What the hell are you
doing in there, Harris?

21:02.595 --> 21:03.830
Trying to sleep.

21:03.863 --> 21:05.231
Why aren't you at Aldo's?

21:05.264 --> 21:07.166
Aldo said I can't stay there
right now.

21:07.199 --> 21:08.501
Please don't tell my mom.

21:08.535 --> 21:10.169
She'd be impossible
if she knew she was right.

21:10.202 --> 21:11.938
Oh, and we can't have that.

21:11.971 --> 21:13.940
All right, for the time being,
you can stay in there.

21:13.973 --> 21:15.775
I'll get you a space heater
and some food.

21:15.808 --> 21:16.909
Thank you.

21:16.943 --> 21:19.145
And you can have this stick
to feel safe.

21:19.178 --> 21:20.947
Don't need it.

21:20.980 --> 21:22.949
Aldo gave me this.

21:24.050 --> 21:25.518
You might want to knock
next time.
