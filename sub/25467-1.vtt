WEBVTT

01:34.129 --> 01:37.610
Guardian, this is Omaha 4-4
on heading 158 to Laredo.

01:39.743 --> 01:41.310
Copy, Omaha 4-4.

01:44.487 --> 01:46.402
I'm picking up movement
on the FLIR.

01:46.576 --> 01:48.447
Coming in for a closer look.
Stand by.

02:25.528 --> 02:28.400
This is the
United States Border Patrol.

02:28.574 --> 02:31.447
Get on your knees
and put your hands up.

02:31.621 --> 02:33.841
- Hey! Get down!
- I speak English.

02:34.015 --> 02:35.494
I speak English. Get down!

02:35.668 --> 02:37.168
Stay down!

02:37.192 --> 02:38.192
Get down!

02:46.767 --> 02:50.205
This is the United States
Border Patrol.

02:50.379 --> 02:54.731
Get on your knees and
put your hands on your head.

03:18.494 --> 03:21.366
This is the United States
Border Patrol.

03:21.540 --> 03:24.108
Get on your knees.
Put your hands up.

03:26.589 --> 03:31.159
This is the United States
Border Patrol.

03:38.122 --> 03:41.212
Let me see your hands!

03:41.386 --> 03:44.085
Show me your hands!
Show me your hands!

03:44.259 --> 03:45.434
Show...!

03:47.262 --> 03:48.959
Be advised.

03:49.133 --> 03:50.502
There's been an explosion.

03:50.526 --> 03:51.744
Officers are down.

04:06.368 --> 04:07.978
Hey! Over here!

04:15.072 --> 04:17.553
What do you got?

04:17.726 --> 04:19.772
Prayer rugs.

04:57.985 --> 04:59.856
Hey, honey. Yeah.

05:29.494 --> 05:31.409
Stay here with me.
Just stay here.

05:31.583 --> 05:33.716
It's okay.

05:36.110 --> 05:37.720
Just come with me slowly
and quietly.

05:37.894 --> 05:40.288
Stay here with me. Stay...
Oh, God.

05:40.462 --> 05:41.550
You don't have to
do this.

05:43.465 --> 05:45.032
You don't have
to do this, please.

05:49.732 --> 05:51.603
The scene in
Kansas City tonight

05:51.777 --> 05:53.518
is one of horror,
confusion and grief.

05:53.692 --> 05:55.781
15 people,
among them two children,

05:55.956 --> 05:58.045
are so far confirmed dead
with many more injured...

05:58.219 --> 05:59.718
The victims' families remain...

05:59.742 --> 06:01.352
Haunting images
of the attackers

06:01.526 --> 06:03.920
are coming to light
from surveillance...

06:04.094 --> 06:05.530
Secretary of Defense
James Riley

06:05.704 --> 06:08.229
is expected to make a
statement on the attacks.

06:08.403 --> 06:11.797
Our intense focus on recovery
and assisting the injured

06:11.972 --> 06:13.886
and the families of
those who have been killed

06:14.061 --> 06:16.106
is matched only by
our determination

06:16.280 --> 06:17.847
to prevent more attacks.

06:22.069 --> 06:24.158
A message to our attackers.

06:26.290 --> 06:29.554
Your bombs do not terrify us.

06:29.728 --> 06:31.556
They empower us.

06:31.730 --> 06:33.170
They empower us
to send you something

06:33.210 --> 06:36.431
that is truly terrifying:

06:36.605 --> 06:39.869
the full weight of
the United States military.

08:16.444 --> 08:17.749
Down, down,
down on the ground!

08:19.969 --> 08:21.971
No! Here for what?!

08:22.145 --> 08:23.581
I'm not the f-fighter!

08:23.755 --> 08:24.887
Fighter!

09:23.772 --> 09:25.339
How you doing?

09:33.782 --> 09:35.502
You think I'm gonna
waterboard you, Bashiir?

09:39.135 --> 09:43.226
Waterboarding is
when we can't torture.

09:43.400 --> 09:45.663
This is Africa.

09:45.837 --> 09:48.231
I can do whatever the fuck
I want here.

09:52.496 --> 09:55.891
You're gonna answer
every question I ask you

09:56.065 --> 09:58.110
without me harming
a hair on your head.

09:58.285 --> 10:00.461
Do you want to know why?

10:05.727 --> 10:07.468
Because if you don't...

10:09.905 --> 10:13.865
...I'm gonna call in
an air strike on your house.

10:17.129 --> 10:19.088
Nice pool, by the way.

10:19.262 --> 10:21.090
Whoever said
crime doesn't pay

10:21.264 --> 10:23.223
wasn't stealing oil tankers,
were they?

10:42.198 --> 10:45.245
Those men are Yemeni.

10:45.419 --> 10:47.856
We have nothing to do
with that.

10:48.030 --> 10:51.555
Your fight is with ISIS,
not me.

10:51.729 --> 10:54.732
All my fights are on water.

10:54.906 --> 10:57.909
They sure are, Bashiir.

10:58.083 --> 10:59.955
And Yemen?

11:03.263 --> 11:05.526
Just across the gulf.

11:05.700 --> 11:07.267
What a coincidence.

11:12.794 --> 11:16.624
It's kind of tricky
for Yemeni nationalists

11:16.798 --> 11:20.584
to book an international flight
these days, huh?

11:20.758 --> 11:22.934
So, if their passports
were fake,

11:23.108 --> 11:25.067
they'd fly straight
to Kansas City

11:25.241 --> 11:27.635
instead of going to Mexico and
hiring coyotes to truck them

11:27.809 --> 11:30.594
a hundred miles
to the desert, right?

11:30.768 --> 11:36.383
So, the big question is:
how'd they get to Mexico?

11:36.557 --> 11:38.428
'Cause they sure as hell
didn't fly.

11:40.387 --> 11:45.479
No, they... traveled by ship.

11:45.653 --> 11:47.568
A ship you didn't
try and steal.

11:47.742 --> 11:52.094
So that means
someone paid you not to.

11:52.268 --> 11:56.316
So, here's my only question,
Bashiir.

11:56.490 --> 11:59.057
Who paid you
to let the ship through?

12:27.608 --> 12:30.306
Is that your brother?

12:30.480 --> 12:33.048
'Cause I don't want
to kill the pool guy.

12:35.746 --> 12:38.793
Every ship smuggles people.Mm-hmm.

12:38.967 --> 12:42.405
And they don't need
my permission.

12:42.579 --> 12:46.017
Yes, they fucking do.

12:46.191 --> 12:49.891
Last chance.

12:50.065 --> 12:52.154
This is a bluff.No.

12:52.328 --> 12:54.896
You American.

12:55.070 --> 12:57.986
You have too many rules.

12:58.160 --> 13:00.989
No rules today, sport,
just orders.

13:01.163 --> 13:03.557
Go ahead, sir. You're green.

13:03.731 --> 13:05.254
Roger that.

13:05.428 --> 13:07.125
No, no, no, no, no.

13:07.299 --> 13:09.563
No, I want you to watch it.
I want you to watch it.

13:09.737 --> 13:11.303
Watch.

13:35.589 --> 13:38.679
You have a big family,
Bashiir.

13:38.853 --> 13:40.507
Lots of brothers.

13:40.681 --> 13:42.987
You should've chosen
another line of work.

13:43.161 --> 13:46.730
I could do this all day.

13:46.904 --> 13:48.863
But sooner or later,

13:49.037 --> 13:51.605
I'll get the brother
you can't live without.

13:54.129 --> 13:57.567
I promise.

13:57.741 --> 13:59.327
It's one more thing

13:59.351 --> 14:01.702
pointing to the cartels.

14:01.876 --> 14:03.767
Now, the money came from
Quassim Al-Raymi's camp,

14:03.791 --> 14:05.227
which isn't a surprise.

14:05.401 --> 14:06.881
The ship, on the other hand,

14:07.055 --> 14:09.274
is a Panamanian freighter,
La Victorina,

14:09.449 --> 14:12.364
registered to the Mexican
holding company Grupo Duro.

14:12.539 --> 14:16.543
It docked at Port of Veracruz
on the 18th.

14:16.717 --> 14:18.458
Carlos Reyes' company.

14:18.632 --> 14:20.590
The one and only.

14:20.764 --> 14:21.983
If you need Matt home,

14:22.157 --> 14:24.202
I can get him out
at 0600 tomorrow.

14:24.376 --> 14:26.596
I'll have a plane
to Washington

14:26.770 --> 14:28.468
ready for you in an hour.

14:28.642 --> 14:31.383
See you tomorrow, Matt.

14:31.558 --> 14:34.909
Smuggling terrorists seems
pretty short-sighted to me.

14:35.083 --> 14:37.912
Border's gonna tighten
like a vice now.

14:38.086 --> 14:41.437
What happened to the price
of cocaine after 9/11, Ken?

14:41.611 --> 14:43.744
Tight borders
are good for business.

15:06.593 --> 15:08.638
Let's go.

15:08.812 --> 15:10.727
Will you be home by 3:00?

15:10.901 --> 15:12.444
I have to stay late
for the science fair.

15:12.468 --> 15:13.643
Do you want me
to pick you up?

15:13.817 --> 15:15.079
I'll take the bus. Okay.

15:18.822 --> 15:20.737
Let's go.

16:11.309 --> 16:13.616
It's pretty good.

16:17.315 --> 16:18.926
How much they make?

16:21.624 --> 16:23.147
For lookout?

16:23.321 --> 16:26.977
20, 30 a day.

16:27.151 --> 16:28.675
Man, but that's
all they're worth.

16:28.849 --> 16:32.156
But you...

16:32.330 --> 16:35.595
well, shit, you know
both sides of the river.

16:35.769 --> 16:38.989
You got a passport.
Come and go as you please.

16:43.254 --> 16:45.213
Rafa!

16:54.439 --> 16:55.658
Eh.

16:59.488 --> 17:00.881
Fat ass.

17:04.972 --> 17:06.412
What's going on?

17:06.582 --> 17:07.931
Hide the beer.

17:19.247 --> 17:21.031
You can name
your own price, you know.

17:21.204 --> 17:24.339
Hmm?

17:24.512 --> 17:26.776
This is the border.

17:26.950 --> 17:29.779
The Matamoros Cartel
pay people well to work it.

17:33.957 --> 17:37.091
You can, uh...

17:37.265 --> 17:39.441
start making your earn
with me, cousin.

17:42.270 --> 17:43.837
Take it.

17:58.242 --> 17:59.853
It's yours.

18:09.689 --> 18:12.300
So, what do I have to do?

18:22.571 --> 18:26.314
You really ought to invest
in a little sunscreen, Matt.

18:26.488 --> 18:28.490
If you guys would start wars
someplace cloudy,

18:28.664 --> 18:30.057
I wouldn't have to.

18:35.976 --> 18:39.022
DOJ get an ID
on those other suicide bombers?

18:39.196 --> 18:41.851
Not yet. Uh, might want to get on that.

18:42.025 --> 18:43.635
There's proof Reyes Cartel

18:43.810 --> 18:46.290
helped one of them
get to the border, so...

18:46.464 --> 18:48.075
we know enough
to move forward.

18:50.555 --> 18:52.383
Mr. Secretary...

18:52.557 --> 18:54.298
Matt Graver.

18:54.472 --> 18:56.344
Have a seat.

19:09.139 --> 19:13.535
What do you think is
the most valuable commodity

19:13.709 --> 19:15.580
that cartels move
across our borders?

19:17.321 --> 19:20.281
20 years ago, cocaine.

19:20.455 --> 19:23.719
Uh, today I'd have to say
it'd be people.

19:23.893 --> 19:27.114
It's a resource they don't
have to cultivate or process

19:27.288 --> 19:28.637
and if they don't
make it across,

19:28.811 --> 19:29.986
they can pay to cross again

19:30.160 --> 19:31.683
at three times
the price of a kilo.

19:33.381 --> 19:37.907
How would you define terrorism,
Mr. Graver?

19:38.081 --> 19:40.388
I think that's your job, sir.

19:44.131 --> 19:46.655
The current definition is
"Any individual or group

19:46.829 --> 19:49.876
that uses violence
to achieve a political goal."

19:50.050 --> 19:52.661
The administration
believes that

19:52.835 --> 19:55.446
the drug cartels
now fit that definition.

19:55.620 --> 19:58.623
Next week, the president's
adding drug cartels

19:58.798 --> 20:01.191
to the list
of terrorist organizations.

20:01.365 --> 20:03.019
You can understand
how that will

20:03.193 --> 20:05.935
expand our ability
to combat them.

20:06.109 --> 20:07.632
The cartel territories

20:07.807 --> 20:09.045
are fairly stable
at the moment,

20:09.069 --> 20:11.549
but as we learned in Iraq,

20:11.723 --> 20:14.161
striking your enemy is
a whole hell of a lot easier

20:14.335 --> 20:16.728
if they're fighting
each other.

20:19.906 --> 20:21.646
I'll do whatever you need.

20:21.821 --> 20:23.997
Just point the way.

20:25.476 --> 20:27.304
Do you have any thoughts?

20:27.478 --> 20:30.481
I mean, I wouldn't take out
a cartel leader.

20:30.655 --> 20:32.919
Turn one cartel into 50.

20:33.093 --> 20:35.835
Besides, killing kings doesn't
start wars, it ends them.

20:36.009 --> 20:37.924
That's our concern.
Mm-hmm.

20:39.360 --> 20:41.188
You have a location on Reyes?

20:41.362 --> 20:43.494
No, but the family's
under surveillance.

20:43.668 --> 20:45.279
Is he in contact with them?

20:45.453 --> 20:47.716
Not to our knowledge,
but we assume yes.

20:47.890 --> 20:50.719
Any kids? HAMMONDS: Two.

20:50.893 --> 20:52.112
What's the age
of the youngest?

20:52.286 --> 20:53.504
Sixteen.

20:53.678 --> 20:54.941
Sixteen?

20:58.379 --> 21:02.470
Yeah, if you want to
start a war...

21:02.644 --> 21:03.906
kidnap a prince.

21:04.080 --> 21:06.169
King will start it for you.

21:10.304 --> 21:12.349
You did this sort of thing
in the Middle East.

21:12.523 --> 21:13.873
Hmm.

21:14.047 --> 21:17.485
You think those tactics
will work here?

21:17.659 --> 21:19.791
If you want it to, sir.

21:30.672 --> 21:33.240
Boots on the ground, you're
gonna hire on the outside.

21:33.414 --> 21:34.934
And the same goes
for your supply train

21:35.068 --> 21:36.983
and for air support.

21:37.157 --> 21:39.246
And I don't need
to remind you

21:39.420 --> 21:42.597
what happens if they figure out
that it's us.

21:46.731 --> 21:48.429
Just to be clear,

21:48.603 --> 21:51.127
you want to see
this thing through,

21:51.301 --> 21:54.304
I'm gonna have to get...
dirty.

21:58.178 --> 22:00.832
Dirty is exactly why
you're here.

22:04.836 --> 22:07.274
What do you need?

22:07.448 --> 22:08.840
Everything.

22:09.015 --> 22:11.104
Drones with
attack capability...

22:11.278 --> 22:13.149
You have Black Hawks, right? Mm-hmm.

22:13.323 --> 22:15.586
I want two of those.
I need logistics,

22:15.760 --> 22:18.850
communications equipment
compatible with a SOCOM JCU.

22:19.025 --> 22:20.852
First phase,
I need a strike team,

22:21.027 --> 22:23.290
two snipers,
I need a demolition team...

22:23.464 --> 22:25.118
Are you going to Ukraine?

22:25.292 --> 22:26.902
I got Russians on the payroll,
brother.

22:27.076 --> 22:28.643
Don't put me
in that position.

22:30.645 --> 22:32.473
Where's the coup?

22:32.647 --> 22:34.388
It's an extraction...

22:34.562 --> 22:35.650
for starters.

22:35.824 --> 22:38.087
How much can I know?

22:38.261 --> 22:40.785
Brother, you don't
want to know.

22:42.700 --> 22:44.180
Well, I don't need specifics,

22:44.354 --> 22:46.356
but I have to know
where they're going.

22:48.706 --> 22:51.405
Mexico.

22:54.277 --> 22:55.472
You gotta be
fucking kidding me.

22:55.496 --> 22:57.237
It's not the government.

22:57.411 --> 23:00.066
It's cartel.

23:01.502 --> 23:03.286
Treasury cutting the checks?

23:03.460 --> 23:05.854
Eh, under a company in Brazil
called Rio Verde.

23:14.515 --> 23:16.343
If it's constant action,

23:16.517 --> 23:19.085
I'm ten mil a month
in payroll and supplies.

23:19.259 --> 23:21.739
At least.

23:21.913 --> 23:25.656
I want 150 over cost
and immunity.

23:28.659 --> 23:30.705
Done.

23:30.879 --> 23:33.119
Congratulations, you can afford
your own hockey team now.

26:00.985 --> 26:03.031
You'll be easy to shop for
at Christmas.

26:06.426 --> 26:07.818
I don't celebrate Christmas.

26:09.603 --> 26:13.084
Well, I bet you will
this year.

26:13.259 --> 26:14.912
What'd they do?

26:15.086 --> 26:16.653
Doesn't matter.

26:24.966 --> 26:27.098
No rules this time.

26:28.317 --> 26:30.450
I'm turning you loose.

26:33.844 --> 26:35.237
How loose?

26:36.978 --> 26:38.849
Carlos Reyes.

26:40.503 --> 26:43.245
How's that for loose?

26:46.379 --> 26:49.077
It's your chance
to get even for your family.

26:55.039 --> 26:58.347
You're gonna help us
start a war.

26:58.521 --> 27:00.436
With who?

27:03.004 --> 27:05.136
Everyone.

27:42.826 --> 27:44.654
Aah! Aah...

27:52.053 --> 27:54.098
Aah!

28:26.827 --> 28:28.045
Adios.

29:04.212 --> 29:06.823
This would have been a lot
easier taking her in the house.

29:06.997 --> 29:10.218
Could get real sloppy
on the street.

29:10.392 --> 29:11.872
Sloppy's good.

29:12.046 --> 29:13.766
Sloppy makes it look like
the cartel did it.

29:22.839 --> 29:24.275
All right,
let's go.

30:11.279 --> 30:13.542
She started it.

30:13.716 --> 30:15.631
Miss Reyes?

30:18.329 --> 30:21.942
She called me a narco
whore and slapped me, so I hit her.

30:22.116 --> 30:24.510
What would you do?

30:24.684 --> 30:26.512
You.

30:26.686 --> 30:28.557
Go to the nurse.

30:31.386 --> 30:33.040
No, you're not
going anywhere.

30:33.214 --> 30:35.042
Sit.

30:43.964 --> 30:45.531
Now what am I going
to do with you?

30:47.576 --> 30:48.969
She deserved
what she got.

30:49.143 --> 30:50.884
It's not your place to do it.

30:51.058 --> 30:53.408
Fine.

30:53.582 --> 30:56.280
You beat the shit out of her.

30:56.455 --> 30:59.806
I should expel you.

31:01.242 --> 31:03.026
Do it.

31:12.079 --> 31:13.820
That's what I thought.

31:32.839 --> 31:34.623
How we looking?

31:34.797 --> 31:37.104
Got eyes on the prize?

31:37.278 --> 31:39.062
Roger.

31:39.236 --> 31:41.456
Prize is in the tail vehicle.

33:00.404 --> 33:01.797
No!

33:03.886 --> 33:05.584
No! No! No!

34:02.075 --> 34:03.772
Where we going? Go straight to the plane.

34:03.946 --> 34:05.402
Don't worry about the vehicle.
We'll take care of it.

34:05.426 --> 34:06.514
All right.

34:14.174 --> 34:16.333
All right, you're
gonna drive that to the mall.

34:16.480 --> 34:19.047
Keys are in the gas flap.
You just leave them there.

34:19.222 --> 34:21.877
All right. Then you go see
what's waiting for you.

35:58.539 --> 36:00.671
Where you got us? Building 5, sir.

36:00.846 --> 36:02.673
You're gonna take a left.
I know where it is.

36:27.524 --> 36:30.136
Now walk me through
what I'm watching here.

36:30.310 --> 36:32.791
This is a map of Mexico
on a hundred-mile grids.

36:32.965 --> 36:34.749
And you took
the subject here.

36:34.923 --> 36:37.317
Speculation is Reyes
has a family residence

36:37.491 --> 36:40.189
somewhere near Monterrey.

36:40.363 --> 36:42.409
Has the Mexican police
responded yet?

36:42.583 --> 36:45.412
Yeah, local, state and federal
police are all there now.

36:45.586 --> 36:48.110
Satellite cannot
pick up cell chatter.

36:48.284 --> 36:49.982
Okay. Yeah, we can lock coordinates

36:50.156 --> 36:51.810
to the cell
and snag the phone number,

36:51.984 --> 36:53.004
but we can't hear the call.

36:53.028 --> 36:54.856
Give me a satellite feed

36:55.030 --> 36:56.336
of the house in Mexico City.

36:56.510 --> 36:58.338
Yeah, you got it.

36:58.512 --> 37:00.514
What we're hoping for is
a call from this location

37:00.688 --> 37:02.472
to start a trail.

37:02.646 --> 37:03.798
Any family
members in the house?

37:03.822 --> 37:05.171
No, just staff.

37:05.345 --> 37:08.261
Teenage girl with
her own 30-room mansion.

37:08.435 --> 37:11.568
I wish I was a teenage girl.

37:11.742 --> 37:13.614
Pull up the incident site.

37:18.010 --> 37:20.012
It looks
like you popped them all.

37:20.186 --> 37:22.231
No, we only engaged one.

37:22.405 --> 37:24.843
One died in the crash, and
the other two we tied and left.

37:25.017 --> 37:27.062
That's a pretty big risk.
Why do that?

37:27.236 --> 37:30.109
Just to see what they'd do.

37:30.283 --> 37:32.589
Back it up.
Show me earlier.

37:32.763 --> 37:34.083
A minute just after we left.Yeah.

37:36.289 --> 37:39.248
Keep going.

37:39.422 --> 37:41.033
All right, there, good.

37:45.602 --> 37:47.802
We have new audio
coming in on the black phone.

37:50.607 --> 37:51.607
Copy that.

38:08.495 --> 38:11.063
Call is not coming
from the house,

38:11.237 --> 38:13.239
it's coming from that fucker
right there.

38:13.413 --> 38:14.893
Give me a live feed
and find him.

38:15.067 --> 38:16.895
On it.

38:19.549 --> 38:21.508
Phone!

38:21.682 --> 38:23.336
Lock in on it.

38:23.510 --> 38:25.599
All right, locking now.

38:25.773 --> 38:28.123
Data link up. There's the king.

38:28.297 --> 38:30.778
There it is.
Start tracking.

38:30.952 --> 38:31.952
Come on.

38:32.084 --> 38:33.389
Tracking on two.

38:33.563 --> 38:35.163
Stand by. We got three.

39:17.477 --> 39:19.087
Por favor.

39:28.009 --> 39:29.793
Por favor.

40:43.302 --> 40:45.347
Get down! Police! Get down!

40:45.521 --> 40:47.828
Hands where I can see 'em! Move! Move!

40:51.005 --> 40:53.094
Clear!

40:53.268 --> 40:54.356
Clear!

41:21.818 --> 41:23.559
We got another one here!

41:27.563 --> 41:31.176
A-Are you okay?

41:31.350 --> 41:32.873
Are we clear?

41:33.047 --> 41:35.397
All clear!

41:35.571 --> 41:37.878
It's okay.

41:38.052 --> 41:41.055
Let's go. It's okay.

41:41.229 --> 41:43.101
It's okay.

41:43.275 --> 41:46.713
It's okay. It's okay.

41:46.887 --> 41:49.933
It's okay.

42:21.400 --> 42:22.966
Am I in Texas?

42:25.665 --> 42:27.275
Yeah, we are.

42:32.628 --> 42:34.804
What do you want us
to call you?

42:37.242 --> 42:39.809
Isabel.
Isabel.

42:42.116 --> 42:43.726
I need to ask you
a question.

42:49.079 --> 42:51.256
Did they hurt you?

42:57.131 --> 42:59.220
What happened here?

43:06.923 --> 43:09.187
I got in a fight at school.

43:13.408 --> 43:15.802
So when do I get
to go back home?

43:15.976 --> 43:18.152
Well, we still need
to work through some things

43:18.326 --> 43:20.633
to make sure we understand
all the circumstances

43:20.807 --> 43:22.809
surrounding
your abduction, okay?

43:22.983 --> 43:24.419
But you're safe.

43:27.205 --> 43:30.033
So hang in there, we're gonna
get you home very soon.

43:36.518 --> 43:39.347
Alicia will look after you.

43:39.521 --> 43:42.350
And if you need anything,
just ask her.

44:21.781 --> 44:24.044
We put the girl in the middle
of Matamoros territory,

44:24.218 --> 44:25.741
and Reyes will start
the fireworks.

44:25.915 --> 44:29.136
What's a good spot
where we can leave her?

44:29.310 --> 44:32.052
We'll hold her in a federal
police depot in Méndez.

44:32.226 --> 44:33.836
We're deep enough
in Matamoros land

44:34.010 --> 44:35.621
that they'll have
to fight their way out

44:35.795 --> 44:37.927
if they come looking for her.

44:41.409 --> 44:43.585
Where do I say you found her?

44:43.759 --> 44:45.805
Oh, say we raided a safe house
in Brownsville

44:45.979 --> 44:47.502
and found her there.

44:47.676 --> 44:49.765
Matamoros Cartel is
very strong in this area.

44:49.939 --> 44:51.700
Reyes will have trouble
getting his men through.

44:51.724 --> 44:53.073
Ah, they'll let
his men through.

44:53.247 --> 44:54.767
Getting back out
will be their problem.

44:56.642 --> 44:58.470
When would you
bring her across?

44:58.644 --> 45:00.210
Well, now that
we got the cartels

45:00.385 --> 45:02.225
at each other's throats,
the sooner the better.

45:02.387 --> 45:03.388
Secret won't keep long.

45:03.562 --> 45:05.520
Uh, there's no secrets
in Mexico.

45:05.694 --> 45:07.087
Why do you think
I'm driving armor?

45:07.261 --> 45:08.828
Can you get me cleared
for that?

45:09.002 --> 45:10.873
Will do.

45:11.047 --> 45:13.441
Federal police will meet you
at the border with an escort.

45:13.615 --> 45:17.837
Thanks.

45:32.634 --> 45:35.158
Still amazes me.

45:35.333 --> 45:38.466
The appetite of this place.

45:38.640 --> 45:40.990
Yeah, well,
welcome to America.

45:43.558 --> 45:44.994
You all right?

45:45.168 --> 45:46.996
What the fuck?!

46:01.141 --> 46:03.535
Hey! Why don't you
keep your fucking eyes peeled?

46:06.233 --> 46:09.018
Ah, you can't even tell
they're gangbangers anymore.

46:44.271 --> 46:47.317
I've got a problem.

46:47.492 --> 46:49.929
Either be home before dawn
or my dad will get mad.

46:50.103 --> 46:52.845
Oh, get the fuck out, dude, no.
No, no, no.

46:53.019 --> 46:55.978
You got a new daddy now.
All right?

46:56.152 --> 46:58.590
When you meet him,
act like a fucking man.

47:00.330 --> 47:01.636
You ready to be a man,
right?

47:03.986 --> 47:07.033
All right, yes, dude.
All right.

47:22.309 --> 47:24.616
Just wait here till
I come get you, all right?

47:46.028 --> 47:47.900
Come on.

48:34.468 --> 48:36.252
No. ¿No?

49:12.637 --> 49:13.637
Sí.

49:22.298 --> 49:23.561
Sí.

49:41.317 --> 49:42.928
How you feeling?

49:48.760 --> 49:50.433
I'd feel better
if someone actually told me

49:50.457 --> 49:52.067
what was going on.

49:52.241 --> 49:54.330
We're turning you over
to the Mexican Army.

49:54.504 --> 49:56.637
They'll arrange to take you
back to your father.

49:58.770 --> 50:00.641
Let's go.

50:26.536 --> 50:28.800
I'm gonna need you
to put this on.

50:44.163 --> 50:46.731
Load up!

50:46.905 --> 50:48.471
Loading up! Heads up!

51:16.064 --> 51:18.501
I have seven Mexican police vehicles

51:18.676 --> 51:20.286
located at the border
checkpoint waiting.

51:20.460 --> 51:22.070
They're moving and forming up

51:22.244 --> 51:23.985
in your configuration
at this time.

51:44.179 --> 51:45.833
It's a nice day
for a drive, huh?

51:46.007 --> 51:47.443
Ah, beautiful day.

51:47.617 --> 51:49.141
Blue skies,
large-caliber weapons.

51:49.315 --> 51:52.231
I love getting out
of the office.

51:52.405 --> 51:54.712
Air, how are we looking?

51:54.886 --> 51:56.539
Clear on both sides.

51:58.628 --> 52:00.369
You see no vehicles?

52:00.543 --> 52:02.023
Nothing but desert.

52:02.197 --> 52:03.808
You're clear.

52:05.374 --> 52:07.637
What's your field of view?

52:07.812 --> 52:10.075
Ten miles in every direction.

52:10.249 --> 52:12.468
Mexico Feds said
that the road would be clear.

52:12.642 --> 52:14.427
Looks like they're
keeping their word.

52:14.601 --> 52:16.241
All right, copy that.

52:25.873 --> 52:28.397
Why weren't we stopped
at the border?

52:28.571 --> 52:31.400
'Cause I'm special.

52:32.880 --> 52:34.795
I thought you were policemen.

52:34.969 --> 52:36.362
You're soldiers.

52:38.625 --> 52:40.559
You know, we saved you...
why don't you just sit back

52:40.583 --> 52:42.237
and be grateful.

52:45.110 --> 52:47.199
Oscar-One, paved road ends

52:47.373 --> 52:48.678
half a mile ahead.

52:48.853 --> 52:50.680
Wait, what?

52:50.855 --> 52:52.770
Paved road ends
in half a klick.

52:52.944 --> 52:54.510
Road isn't paved ahead.

52:54.684 --> 52:56.556
You got your thermal?
Yeah, in my bag

52:56.730 --> 52:59.037
in the back; you gotta take the wheel.
All right.

53:00.603 --> 53:01.909
Got it.

53:03.693 --> 53:05.260
Oh, shit.

53:14.313 --> 53:16.402
Nothing's ever easy.

53:16.576 --> 53:19.187
I got it.

53:19.361 --> 53:20.449
Shit.

53:20.623 --> 53:22.538
I got no vis.

53:22.712 --> 53:24.540
This fucker's speeding up.

53:24.714 --> 53:26.978
Well, he's not stupid.
Stay on his ass.

53:29.807 --> 53:31.939
Dirt roads make me nervous.

54:13.807 --> 54:15.461
Air, I'm blind here.

54:15.635 --> 54:17.463
Road's clear.

54:17.637 --> 54:19.726
No vehicles, no movement,
left or right.

54:25.732 --> 54:27.777
All right, anything?

54:27.952 --> 54:30.302
Shit. Oscar-One,
incoming on your right.

54:30.476 --> 54:31.912
Air, I see nothing. Contact right.

54:32.086 --> 54:33.479
I don't see anything.

54:33.653 --> 54:36.351
All down! Down!

54:52.280 --> 54:54.152
Stuck! I'm stuck!

55:01.855 --> 55:03.770
Aw, come on!

55:03.944 --> 55:05.641
West side, hundred meters!

55:05.815 --> 55:07.078
Take him out!

55:07.252 --> 55:08.652
Roger that. Heads down!

55:08.818 --> 55:10.820
Heads down!

55:13.649 --> 55:15.042
We're stuck. We're stuck.

55:18.785 --> 55:20.787
Go! Go, go!

56:32.641 --> 56:35.035
Cease fire! Cease fire!

56:44.001 --> 56:45.915
Clear!

56:48.309 --> 56:49.484
Clear.

56:49.658 --> 56:50.658
Drop your weapon!

56:50.703 --> 56:51.791
Them, over there. Sir!

56:56.274 --> 56:58.363
Spread out!

57:03.281 --> 57:04.673
Put 'em down, guys!

57:04.847 --> 57:06.197
Easy, easy.

57:08.373 --> 57:10.462
- !Abajo!
- Ayuda.

57:10.636 --> 57:12.476
Easy, guys, easy.

57:12.638 --> 57:14.466
Down. Down.! Ayuda!

57:35.356 --> 57:36.966
Fuck!

57:37.141 --> 57:38.794
Shit.

57:38.968 --> 57:41.362
Fuckin' Mexican police
shot me?

57:41.536 --> 57:43.190
You all right?

57:43.364 --> 57:44.844
Oh, shit.

57:45.018 --> 57:47.020
I'm good.
It caught the plate.

57:47.194 --> 57:49.544
All right. We clear?

57:49.718 --> 57:52.199
Sir! We have police vehicles
approaching from the south.

57:52.373 --> 57:53.592
Five klicks out.

57:54.984 --> 57:56.203
All right, load up!

57:56.377 --> 57:58.075
Come on, load up!

58:06.692 --> 58:08.085
Where is she?

58:11.349 --> 58:12.524
New mission!

58:12.698 --> 58:14.134
Gather round! New mission!

58:14.308 --> 58:16.658
Uh... no time for that.

58:16.832 --> 58:19.226
Head north. I'll find her.

58:22.360 --> 58:23.839
Okay. Go.

58:24.013 --> 58:26.190
All right, we got company
three klicks out,

58:26.364 --> 58:27.669
coming from the south.

58:27.843 --> 58:29.671
Grab that Humvee,
pull this thing out.

58:29.845 --> 58:30.845
Go! Now! Now!

58:32.718 --> 58:34.850
Come on, guys! Now!

58:35.024 --> 58:37.157
Go, go! Let's go!

58:37.331 --> 58:38.941
Let's go! Move it!

59:01.442 --> 59:02.704
Take this.

59:02.878 --> 59:05.751
All right?

59:05.925 --> 59:08.014
Send me a signal
when you get to the border,

59:08.188 --> 59:09.450
we'll come and get you.

59:09.624 --> 59:10.973
All right?

59:13.019 --> 59:15.413
Let's go, let's go!
Let's move it!

59:27.512 --> 59:29.427
All right,
everyone in their vehicles!

59:57.890 --> 01:00:00.414
Air, we need a medivac
from rally point alpha.

01:00:00.588 --> 01:00:02.721
Contact 47th med at Laughlin.

01:00:02.895 --> 01:00:04.636
Roger that, Oscar-One.

01:00:04.810 --> 01:00:06.725
Be advised,
you have police vehicles

01:00:06.899 --> 01:00:08.179
approaching your six
in a Code 3.

01:00:08.292 --> 01:00:09.510
Oh, that's great.

01:00:09.684 --> 01:00:11.338
Police approaching
our six fast.

01:00:13.035 --> 01:00:15.081
Air, we need a lane clear
at the border.

01:00:15.255 --> 01:00:16.952
No bullshit.
Anybody gets in our way,

01:00:17.126 --> 01:00:18.246
we drive right through them.

01:00:38.496 --> 01:00:40.933
Border coming up fast.
Border.

01:01:22.104 --> 01:01:23.104
!Oye!

01:01:24.716 --> 01:01:25.716
!Oye!

01:01:27.022 --> 01:01:28.285
!Oye!

01:01:40.949 --> 01:01:42.342
Isabel?

01:02:00.012 --> 01:02:01.012
No!

01:02:02.101 --> 01:02:03.363
No!

01:02:26.995 --> 01:02:28.388
Get in.

01:03:47.511 --> 01:03:49.556
Who kidnapped me?

01:03:57.303 --> 01:03:59.566
Your father
has a lot of enemies.

01:04:03.222 --> 01:04:05.267
And you're one of them?

01:04:06.921 --> 01:04:08.488
Yes, I am.

01:04:23.155 --> 01:04:25.766
You're gonna need stitches.
Yeah. Lucky for me,

01:04:25.940 --> 01:04:28.465
I'll still need
them tomorrow.

01:04:28.639 --> 01:04:30.989
Miss Sunshine on your six.

01:04:31.163 --> 01:04:33.557
Hi. Fuckin' Mondays, huh?

01:04:35.994 --> 01:04:38.518
Can we go somewhere
that's private?

01:04:39.693 --> 01:04:40.999
All right.

01:04:41.173 --> 01:04:43.567
Can you give me a sec?
Ma'am.

01:04:47.266 --> 01:04:48.506
My source is
with her right now.

01:04:48.572 --> 01:04:50.051
She'll be back in an hour.

01:04:50.225 --> 01:04:51.662
That's not what
I'm talking about.

01:04:51.836 --> 01:04:53.228
It was a green on blue,
Cynthia.

01:04:53.402 --> 01:04:54.621
There was no other option.

01:04:54.795 --> 01:04:56.536
You wanted Afghanistan,
now you got it.

01:04:56.710 --> 01:04:58.016
This isn't Afghanistan.

01:04:58.190 --> 01:04:59.887
This is our fucking neighbor!

01:05:00.061 --> 01:05:03.456
There are 54 million Americans
with relatives there,

01:05:03.630 --> 01:05:05.502
Mm-hmm. and they're all sitting around

01:05:05.676 --> 01:05:08.722
watching footage
of dead Mexican police

01:05:08.896 --> 01:05:11.508
on Fox News. The police were the ambush.

01:05:11.682 --> 01:05:13.205
Oh, yeah, okay. We had no choice.

01:05:13.379 --> 01:05:15.033
All... They attacked us.

01:05:15.207 --> 01:05:16.730
Doesn't matter.

01:05:16.904 --> 01:05:18.464
POTUS doesn't have
the stomach for this.

01:05:18.558 --> 01:05:19.994
He shut us down.

01:05:20.168 --> 01:05:22.301
What did you say? We're shut down.

01:05:24.129 --> 01:05:25.870
I did my fuckin' job.
You do yours.

01:05:26.044 --> 01:05:28.089
You sit that
fuckin' coward down,

01:05:28.263 --> 01:05:31.876
and you explain to him...
this is how we win.

01:05:32.050 --> 01:05:33.399
He's not worried
about winning.

01:05:33.573 --> 01:05:36.141
He's worried about
being fucking impeached,

01:05:36.315 --> 01:05:38.665
because you killed
two dozen Mexican police.

01:05:38.839 --> 01:05:40.406
Who worked for Reyes.

01:05:40.580 --> 01:05:42.713
Spin it. Do your job.

01:05:42.887 --> 01:05:44.715
This only strengthens
our position.

01:05:44.889 --> 01:05:46.543
We don't have a position,
Matt.

01:05:46.717 --> 01:05:49.023
Because we're not supposed
to fucking be there.

01:05:49.197 --> 01:05:51.852
Your objective was to start
a war with Mexican cartels,

01:05:52.026 --> 01:05:54.333
not with
the Mexican government.

01:05:54.507 --> 01:05:55.900
You know what?

01:05:56.074 --> 01:05:57.945
This-this is why
nothing ever changes.

01:05:58.119 --> 01:06:01.122
You think change
is the goal? Really?

01:06:01.296 --> 01:06:04.082
You've been doing this too long
to believe that.

01:07:44.617 --> 01:07:46.140
Sí.

01:09:23.323 --> 01:09:26.937
Why didn't you hold her
someplace in Mexico?

01:09:27.111 --> 01:09:29.156
We don't have the
infrastructure for that, sir.

01:09:29.330 --> 01:09:31.050
Mission security
would be almost impossible.

01:09:31.115 --> 01:09:32.680
Was this your mission? No, sir.

01:09:32.856 --> 01:09:34.379
Then why are you answering?

01:09:34.553 --> 01:09:37.295
Mr. Graver?

01:09:37.469 --> 01:09:39.776
We don't have the
infrastructure for that, sir.

01:09:39.950 --> 01:09:42.691
Mission security
would be almost impossible.

01:09:48.305 --> 01:09:51.483
And this girl was witness to
all aspects of the mission,

01:09:51.657 --> 01:09:54.616
correct? No, she was shielded
from the kidnapping.

01:09:54.791 --> 01:09:57.315
What about the 25
Mexican police officers

01:09:57.489 --> 01:09:59.186
that were killed,
on foreign soil,

01:09:59.360 --> 01:10:01.275
all of which she witnessed?

01:10:01.449 --> 01:10:03.538
The ones who attacked us?
Yes, sir.

01:10:06.237 --> 01:10:08.369
Where is she?

01:10:08.543 --> 01:10:11.677
I have a source
bringing her to the border.

01:10:11.851 --> 01:10:13.984
Do we have an exact location?

01:10:15.681 --> 01:10:17.901
That question is for you, Mr. Forsing.

01:10:19.554 --> 01:10:21.165
We don't know
her whereabouts, sir,

01:10:21.339 --> 01:10:23.080
but he has a beacon...
he'll activate it

01:10:23.254 --> 01:10:25.169
as soon as he gets close
to the border.

01:10:25.343 --> 01:10:27.780
If they can make it
to the border.

01:10:27.954 --> 01:10:30.870
Which is a chance
we cannot take.

01:10:32.698 --> 01:10:34.743
Cynthia.

01:10:34.918 --> 01:10:36.267
Yes, sir?

01:10:38.312 --> 01:10:40.227
You handle it from here.

01:10:55.416 --> 01:10:58.376
We can't risk her falling
into the wrong hands.

01:10:58.550 --> 01:11:00.508
When the beacon's activated,

01:11:00.682 --> 01:11:02.249
your team takes them.

01:11:02.423 --> 01:11:03.511
You understand?

01:11:06.384 --> 01:11:08.908
Clean the scene.

01:11:09.082 --> 01:11:11.563
When I say clean, gentlemen,
I mean spotless.

01:11:11.737 --> 01:11:13.565
Your operative included.

01:11:19.005 --> 01:11:20.702
Do you know...

01:11:20.877 --> 01:11:23.531
how hard he was to make?

01:11:23.705 --> 01:11:25.751
I could throw a stick
across the river

01:11:25.925 --> 01:11:28.319
and hit 50 grieving fathers.

01:11:28.493 --> 01:11:30.364
Make another one.

01:11:30.538 --> 01:11:32.497
Can't do that.

01:11:32.671 --> 01:11:35.108
Well, look who doesn't have
the stomach for it now.

01:11:35.282 --> 01:11:37.197
Oh, who are you
to question me

01:11:37.371 --> 01:11:39.373
after all the shit
that I've eaten for you?

01:11:39.547 --> 01:11:43.595
We ID'd
the other bombers, Matt.

01:11:43.769 --> 01:11:45.553
They're U.S. citizens.

01:11:45.727 --> 01:11:47.816
They're from New Jersey.
Doesn't change anything.

01:11:47.991 --> 01:11:49.949
It changes
the fucking narrative!

01:12:57.190 --> 01:12:58.365
Hey.

01:12:58.539 --> 01:12:59.801
Hey.

01:12:59.976 --> 01:13:01.499
You got the girl?

01:13:01.673 --> 01:13:03.240
She's with me now, yeah.

01:13:05.155 --> 01:13:07.026
They want me to cut ties.

01:13:07.200 --> 01:13:09.202
You got to get rid of her.

01:13:14.468 --> 01:13:16.731
I can't do that.

01:13:16.905 --> 01:13:18.907
What are you telling me?

01:13:19.082 --> 01:13:21.258
Not this one.

01:13:23.086 --> 01:13:25.131
Help me get her across,

01:13:25.305 --> 01:13:27.438
and we can decide
what to do with her.

01:13:27.612 --> 01:13:31.224
Uh-uh. Don't put me
in that situation.

01:13:31.398 --> 01:13:34.097
If they're cutting ties,
you're already in that situation.

01:13:38.797 --> 01:13:41.104
If she stays here,
she'll be killed.

01:13:43.541 --> 01:13:45.630
Help me get her across.

01:13:51.331 --> 01:13:53.594
I can't help you do that.

01:14:02.299 --> 01:14:04.736
You gotta do
what you gotta do.

01:14:04.910 --> 01:14:06.955
I'll figure it out.

01:14:11.960 --> 01:14:13.658
Good luck.

01:15:17.113 --> 01:15:19.767
I got to get you north.

01:16:07.075 --> 01:16:08.903
See, the flashing light
is you.

01:16:09.077 --> 01:16:10.905
All right? That red line,

01:16:11.079 --> 01:16:12.429
that's your path.

01:16:12.603 --> 01:16:14.170
Okay. Don't get that wet.

01:16:24.615 --> 01:16:26.834
Keep it safe for a bit.

01:16:33.319 --> 01:16:35.626
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey.

01:16:35.800 --> 01:16:38.019
They're sheep.

01:16:38.194 --> 01:16:40.326
Treat them like it.

01:17:04.742 --> 01:17:06.396
!Rápido!

01:17:14.752 --> 01:17:16.319
!Vámonos!

01:18:26.867 --> 01:18:28.826
Follow the trail to the road.

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:30.741
Your ride's waiting.

01:18:53.720 --> 01:18:55.548
It's okay.

01:18:55.722 --> 01:18:57.333
Come on.

01:19:15.176 --> 01:19:17.831
Show me a job that pays better
and I'll do it.

01:19:19.529 --> 01:19:21.357
Where are you headed, baby?

01:19:21.531 --> 01:19:23.335
Get me to the
grocery store on Trenton.

01:19:23.359 --> 01:19:24.795
I can walk from there.

01:19:47.252 --> 01:19:49.472
Why does a soldier know
sign language?

01:19:52.910 --> 01:19:54.477
My daughter was deaf.

01:20:02.876 --> 01:20:05.009
I know who you are.

01:20:09.187 --> 01:20:12.495
You're the attorney
whose family they killed.

01:20:16.020 --> 01:20:18.109
Not "they."

01:20:25.508 --> 01:20:28.293
My father.

01:20:28.467 --> 01:20:30.687
A man who worked for him.

01:20:38.956 --> 01:20:40.261
Why?

01:20:41.698 --> 01:20:44.091
To send a message.

01:20:46.529 --> 01:20:49.357
Now you hunt them...

01:20:49.532 --> 01:20:52.448
so you won't be a message.

01:20:53.623 --> 01:20:57.540
I will always be a message.

01:20:57.714 --> 01:21:01.239
Only now,
the message is different.

01:21:16.950 --> 01:21:20.301
Is the border hard to cross?

01:21:24.523 --> 01:21:27.091
It could be...

01:21:27.265 --> 01:21:29.136
for Isabel Reyes.

01:21:45.849 --> 01:21:48.634
From now on,
your name is Carina.

01:23:03.448 --> 01:23:05.798
Signal was activated at 1939,

01:23:05.972 --> 01:23:07.887
heading northeast of Reynosa.

01:23:14.024 --> 01:23:16.200
I'm sending another team
to finish this.

01:23:16.374 --> 01:23:19.682
No. I'll do it.

01:23:19.856 --> 01:23:22.815
'Cause if I don't, he'll
probably come and kill you.

01:26:17.642 --> 01:26:19.296
Oh...

01:28:47.705 --> 01:28:49.905
There's interference on the road.

01:28:51.839 --> 01:28:55.191
Are the vehicles unmarked
or police? Unmarked.

01:28:58.194 --> 01:29:00.022
ETA to target?

01:29:00.196 --> 01:29:01.762
25 minutes.

01:30:02.649 --> 01:30:04.173
No.

01:30:56.529 --> 01:30:57.529
No?

01:32:05.816 --> 01:32:07.034
No.

01:33:59.538 --> 01:34:00.626
Huh?

01:34:53.113 --> 01:34:54.811
No! No!

01:34:54.985 --> 01:34:55.985
No! No! No!

01:35:01.731 --> 01:35:02.862
No!

01:35:23.840 --> 01:35:27.452
That's him. ETA?

01:35:27.626 --> 01:35:29.498
15 minutes.

01:35:29.672 --> 01:35:32.588
Get us there in ten...
I can't have the girl talk.

01:35:32.762 --> 01:35:34.154
Hang on back there.

01:35:34.329 --> 01:35:36.113
Gonna get bumpy.

01:36:58.630 --> 01:37:00.632
José.

01:38:52.744 --> 01:38:53.744
No!

01:38:55.007 --> 01:38:56.182
No!

01:39:56.982 --> 01:39:59.681
Glad we didn't
have to do that.

01:39:59.855 --> 01:40:01.683
What about the girl?

01:40:04.816 --> 01:40:06.688
Two minutes out.

01:40:08.385 --> 01:40:10.039
Matt?

01:40:22.181 --> 01:40:25.054
Base, what's subject's
exact location inside the car?

01:40:25.228 --> 01:40:27.188
Subject is back seat,

01:40:27.230 --> 01:40:29.058
right side
behind the passenger.

01:40:31.626 --> 01:40:35.499
Prize is passenger side,
second seat, green Expedition.

01:40:38.197 --> 01:40:39.808
Rules of engagement?

01:40:45.161 --> 01:40:47.554
Fuck it all.

01:40:47.729 --> 01:40:50.514
Wipe it clean.

01:45:26.355 --> 01:45:28.792
Stand up! Stand up!

01:45:43.938 --> 01:45:46.244
What are you doing?

01:45:46.418 --> 01:45:47.724
Matt!

01:45:47.898 --> 01:45:50.292
You're fucking us!

01:45:50.466 --> 01:45:53.251
She said spotless. Fuck 'em all.

01:45:53.425 --> 01:45:55.079
She'll go
into witness protection.

01:53:22.874 --> 01:53:24.485
Sit down.

01:54:05.090 --> 01:54:07.658
So you wanna be a sicario.

01:54:26.677 --> 01:54:28.853
Let's talk about your future.
