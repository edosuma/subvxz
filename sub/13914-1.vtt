00:52.187 --> 00:52.912
Rach!

00:54.225 --> 00:55.032
Rach...

01:34.956 --> 01:36.956
Good morning!

01:40.814 --> 01:42.914
Surprise!

01:43.331 --> 01:45.731
Breakfast in bed.

01:47.047 --> 01:50.914
Oh, how sweet... the mango
cut into little hearts!

01:50.949 --> 01:55.624
Yup. And the moon apples and
the smiley face.  Bacon smiley face.

01:58.248 --> 02:00.438
I'm not coming to Niagara Falls.

02:02.790 --> 02:07.395
Not funny cause... you know how
hard it was to get a jacuzzi room?

02:07.415 --> 02:08.866
You know you have to
book that way in advance

02:08.868 --> 02:11.400
and they don't give a
refund on the jacuzzi room.

02:12.248 --> 02:17.214
Listen I'm... Jordan, I'm going
through something and...

02:17.396 --> 02:21.497
I think that I need to...
that we need...

02:21.515 --> 02:25.532
Okay, hold on.
Wait!  Just wait.

02:28.449 --> 02:32.127
No! Hey hey hey!
What are you doing?

02:32.162 --> 02:36.315
Okay. This stuff is suppose to
happen till tomorrow night...

02:37.092 --> 02:39.930
- So I'm jumping the gun here.
- No! Maybe no...

02:40.049 --> 02:43.916
You... are the only girl that
I ever wanted to be with.

02:44.208 --> 02:49.209
Rachel Stern, will you marry me?

02:52.067 --> 02:55.304
I can't spend the rest of my life

02:56.138 --> 02:59.167
having sex with just you.

03:00.835 --> 03:03.234
We're breaking up!

03:04.709 --> 03:08.584
Okay, okay.  So, Rach ...

03:08.835 --> 03:12.025
Okay love, I can get better!

03:12.334 --> 03:14.279
What? I can!  I can get better.

03:14.280 --> 03:17.841
You just... you just tell me
what it is I'm doing wrong.

03:17.876 --> 03:20.945
- I don't think that's a very good idea.
- I can take it okay! Come on.

03:21.001 --> 03:23.001
Yeah?

03:23.835 --> 03:25.735
All right.

03:28.710 --> 03:32.298
- You have bad breath.
- Yeah, I can fix that.

03:32.318 --> 03:36.300
You're sloppy kisser.  You've no
idea what to do with my breasts.

03:36.421 --> 03:40.524
Sometimes I think you're actually trying
to feed but you come way too fast.

03:40.543 --> 03:43.221
- Your penis is just so ...
- Okay, I'm good, thanks.

03:43.222 --> 03:44.354
- So you don't have to.
- ...to the side and then

03:44.355 --> 03:48.213
you never go down on me.
You refer to sex as gentle time.

03:48.248 --> 03:51.426
You are terrified of going
anywhere near my asshole.

03:51.427 --> 03:53.834
- You won't consider a threesome.
- Why would I want to have a threesome!

03:53.869 --> 03:56.137
Why, so I can disappoint
two people at the same time?

03:56.437 --> 03:58.730
Well, it's a good point.

03:58.735 --> 04:04.167
Okay, look, Rach.  We can fix
this, right.  We can fix this thing.

04:04.168 --> 04:07.522
I can read a book.
No, I ... we can make some list.

04:07.557 --> 04:10.991
We can fix this thing
together as a team.

04:11.026 --> 04:15.653
Okay, but there are so much
that I haven't experienced.

04:15.837 --> 04:20.851
And being with you this past year,
I just... I need to get out there.

04:21.837 --> 04:26.103
We both do.  We tried.
We really tried.

04:26.703 --> 04:30.313
So I need to move on and...

04:31.507 --> 04:34.718
- Hey I'm setting you free.
- But I don't want to be free.

04:34.838 --> 04:37.795
- I wanna be with you.
- No, no! Just don't, don't.

04:37.796 --> 04:40.384
No! No!
Take your week off.

04:40.804 --> 04:45.866
Oh, go to Toronto, stay with
Dandak, have fun.  Right?

04:45.902 --> 04:48.953
When you get back, I'll move in
with my sister and we can...

04:48.954 --> 04:52.579
Okay, woah. No!
Just hold on. Please.

04:53.630 --> 04:57.976
Okay, alright.  You made
your point, okay, I hear you.

04:58.097 --> 05:00.884
- I'm a crappy lover, okay?
- Yup.

05:01.019 --> 05:03.802
Alright, but look...
I checked this in.

05:03.922 --> 05:08.943
I got you the window seat which
you love, okay.  I'm in the aisle.

05:08.978 --> 05:12.463
And you know, let's just go
and talk about it on vacation.

05:23.556 --> 05:25.755
Gary's totally overworked.

05:26.080 --> 05:29.160
And you better get to it chop, chop

05:29.161 --> 05:31.720
since you're decking out early
for that lame-ass trip of yours.

05:31.729 --> 05:35.386
- Yeah I know, Kelly, we...
- What you gonna cry?

05:35.507 --> 05:38.928
- Need a tissue?
- No, I don't.

05:39.048 --> 05:42.906
My God, you are crying.
You are actually...

05:57.541 --> 05:59.972
- Hey Mom.
- Are you out of your mind?

06:00.092 --> 06:05.012
- You waited years for her like a schmuck.
- What did she say to you? That's not...

06:05.133 --> 06:06.138
<i>You think she can do better? </i>

06:06.139 --> 06:09.105
You should be proposing to that
woman, not breaking up with her.

06:09.140 --> 06:12.613
Woah.  What...?  No one's breaking
up with any one, Mom.  Okay.

06:12.633 --> 06:15.764
In fact, we're meeting at
the airport in like three hours

06:15.765 --> 06:18.217
for a very special trip to a very...

06:18.252 --> 06:20.837
I can't talk now.
I'm working out.

06:25.559 --> 06:30.913
<i>This is the final boarding
call for Flight 632 to Toronto.</i>

06:31.247 --> 06:34.750
<i>All passengers must now get on board.</i>

06:40.901 --> 06:46.513
<i>... paging Toronto
passenger Jordan Abrams.</i>

06:46.926 --> 06:50.400
<i>Jordan Abrams,
please report to the gate.</i>

06:51.101 --> 06:53.401
I'm waiting for someone.

06:53.843 --> 06:56.043
<i>She's not coming.</i>

07:08.027 --> 07:11.190
- What is it, Jordan?
- Hey, are you through security yet?

07:11.310 --> 07:14.150
- No, I'm not coming.
- Come on, you better hurry up honey.

07:14.152 --> 07:16.882
- They're closing the gates here.
- No. I am not coming okay.

07:16.883 --> 07:18.839
We need some space right now.

07:20.095 --> 07:22.244
Okay, you know what?
I'm coming right home

07:22.245 --> 07:24.017
and we'll just reschedule
the flight for tomorrow.

07:24.052 --> 07:27.615
No, no, no!  You're
not listening, Jordan.

07:27.650 --> 07:31.585
I need this, I do.
I'll see you in a week.

07:36.845 --> 07:39.624
You strike me as a kind of...
Hello!

07:41.396 --> 07:45.391
<i>You strike me as a kind of
guy people need a break from.</i>

07:45.512 --> 07:47.911
<i>You're smothering her.</i>

07:48.429 --> 07:50.828
<i>Get on the plane.</i>

08:19.555 --> 08:22.612
There he is.
Come here.

08:23.788 --> 08:26.320
The next seven days
you observe my every move,

08:26.321 --> 08:28.875
study my every gesture and
stay close to exactly as I say.

08:28.910 --> 08:31.352
Watch, listen, be a sponge.

08:31.373 --> 08:34.520
Life is a buffet, my friend.   You
probably said that like a million times.

08:34.522 --> 08:37.549
- I don't think so.
- Now, it's time for you
to eat off the buffet.

08:37.583 --> 08:41.059
Now what's to consider if you agreed.
Shaved? I'm guessing not!

08:41.080 --> 08:43.722
- That's alright, I have enough to...
- I'm sorry, man.

08:43.722 --> 08:47.130
I have no intention of being
unfaithful to Rachel, okay.

08:47.134 --> 08:49.528
Unfaithful?
She dumped you, dude.

08:49.548 --> 08:52.555
Oh, that's very nice.  That's
very compassionate and sensitive.

08:52.556 --> 08:54.261
No, stop!  That's not fair!

08:54.348 --> 08:57.203
I've watched you pine for this
girl since you were 12 years old.

08:57.223 --> 09:00.479
It took you 24 years to
convince her to give you a shot.

09:00.599 --> 09:03.120
You took that shot.  It didn't
work out.  I'm sorry about that.

09:03.121 --> 09:04.709
But it's time for you to move on.

09:04.815 --> 09:08.361
And as your sexual mentor,
I need you to stay focused.

09:08.382 --> 09:11.740
Excuse me.  I'm sorry to bother you.
First of all, beautiful boots!

09:11.860 --> 09:14.263
Can I ask you a question?
Is that alright?

09:14.724 --> 09:19.632
My friend here, do we...?
Do you find him attractive?

09:21.350 --> 09:23.948
Yeah, he's not bad, maybe a seven.

09:25.024 --> 09:27.212
- 7 out of 20?
- No.

09:27.346 --> 09:29.772
- Is that out of 10?  Wow!
- Yeah, dude.

09:29.858 --> 09:32.263
I was gonna say 5 or 6,
but you're in great shape.

09:32.283 --> 09:34.750
- A 7 out of 10, for sure, right?
- 7.

09:34.751 --> 09:35.856
- For sure?
- Yes!

09:35.891 --> 09:39.413
Listen!  We're throwing him a little
shindig tonight.  He's new in town.

09:39.533 --> 09:42.278
Why don't you, your beautiful boots,
some of your friends?  Come on by.

09:42.279 --> 09:45.800
Eightish, Apartment 4.
What do you say?

09:46.933 --> 09:49.380
- Sure.
- Yes.  Fantastic!

09:51.151 --> 09:53.611
See, a little sexual
confidence goes a long way.

09:53.612 --> 09:55.620
- It's not genetics.  It's not tricks.
- Trust me on this man, okay.

09:55.622 --> 09:57.371
I know Rachel better
than she knows herself.

09:57.491 --> 09:59.217
By tonight she will have called me,

09:59.218 --> 10:01.977
by tomorrow she'll be
on a plane here, alright.

10:03.717 --> 10:05.218
There's still a chance, brother,

10:05.219 --> 10:07.919
to take those shriveled little
raisins you call testicles

10:07.954 --> 10:10.634
and put them back where they
belong inside your scrotum,

10:10.635 --> 10:13.070
which, I reiterate
must be clearly shorten.

10:13.105 --> 10:15.755
It's common courtesy.
Ladies expect it.

10:27.552 --> 10:30.015
Oh, easy easy!

10:30.236 --> 10:33.448
The less you struggle,
the less it will pinch.

10:34.935 --> 10:36.935
Hey, wait wait wait!

10:38.852 --> 10:40.933
No! No ...

10:41.735 --> 10:43.818
No, no, no!

10:44.017 --> 10:47.043
Oh God!  Be gentle, please!

10:48.811 --> 10:51.845
Thank you Renaldo.
Appreciate that. This is for you.

10:53.019 --> 10:56.060
- Oh, for the love of God!  Wait for me.
- Very well.

10:59.653 --> 11:01.733
Squeeze!

11:02.054 --> 11:04.811
- What the fuck you doing right here?
- I know, I know!

11:04.812 --> 11:06.040
- Look look look look!
- I'm...

11:06.045 --> 11:08.306
I know! I just have a question
first.  I have a question.

11:08.307 --> 11:11.412
What is the deal with half-naked
dude serving drinks?

11:11.413 --> 11:12.540
Right right.
Yes, no...

11:12.541 --> 11:15.067
He is here to make
sure that you get laid.

11:15.187 --> 11:19.692
Yes, women are all wrapped up thinking
about some sexual nature and what not!

11:19.812 --> 11:22.660
I don't understand how... why
don't they just have sex with him?

11:22.661 --> 11:25.000
- He's very good looking.
- Herein lies the genius of my plans.

11:25.002 --> 11:28.371
See, that gentleman enjoys the
company of other gay gentlemen.

11:28.554 --> 11:32.609
Alright, so women
will have no choice but...

11:32.730 --> 11:35.972
- Give me the phone, please.
- No, enough, enough! Listen. No.

11:36.138 --> 11:38.534
Not until you talk
to one of these girls.

11:38.554 --> 11:42.568
Alright, that's all I'm asking.
For me. Baby stuff, talk okay. Listen.

11:42.688 --> 11:46.751
I know you're nervous,
but you're a solid 7.

11:46.886 --> 11:50.180
- You're a solid 7.
- Alright, alright.

11:50.315 --> 11:53.161
Well so...  if you
could please direct me

11:53.319 --> 11:58.025
to a lady with whom you're not
having of course, I will talk to her.

11:58.060 --> 12:00.614
Rush up.
Not these two.

12:00.789 --> 12:03.188
No, I've been inside that.

12:04.147 --> 12:08.153
- There!  Does bomb sex count?
- No, that's fine.

12:08.288 --> 12:09.770
- Okay, then the brunette.
- Okay.

12:09.771 --> 12:11.483
Just have bomb sex with the brunette.

12:26.298 --> 12:28.653
- Hi!  Hey.
- Hi.

12:28.772 --> 12:30.773
Hi ...

12:33.357 --> 12:35.849
- I'm Tanya.
- Tanya, Tanya...

12:36.250 --> 12:38.442
- Jordan.
- Hello.

12:38.443 --> 12:40.643
- Pleasure to meet you, Tanya.
- Hi.

12:42.133 --> 12:44.973
So... what do you do?

12:45.315 --> 12:47.738
- What do you do?
- Excuse me?

12:47.857 --> 12:51.382
What you... How do you gig?
What is your gig?

12:51.398 --> 12:54.380
I don't understand.

12:54.410 --> 12:57.623
- Job. What do you do for work?
- Real Estate?

12:57.624 --> 12:59.830
Oh yeah?
Real estate?

13:00.358 --> 13:03.973
Homo...  Home owner.
I am a home owner.

13:03.984 --> 13:06.268
- Oh!
- It's cool, yeah.  No, it's cool.

13:06.269 --> 13:09.808
I mean it's...
You know it's cute... clute...

13:10.384 --> 13:13.546
- Coo... coo coo...
- Are you okay?

13:13.566 --> 13:16.778
I just... I really...
I miss my girlfriend a lot.

13:17.319 --> 13:19.324
- Excuse me.
- Oh oh.

13:23.484 --> 13:26.600
There, I talked, okay.
Made an ass of myself with it.

13:26.626 --> 13:29.995
Hey dude. Where are you going?
What's with the costume?

13:30.030 --> 13:34.197
Yeah, to ward off another one of
this strange marriage candidates.

13:34.317 --> 13:36.460
Oh my God, your parents
are still setting you up.

13:36.461 --> 13:39.359
Yes, very helpful in Hindu family GTA.

13:39.443 --> 13:43.523
Sorry I got to step outside.
You are in charge whilst I'm gone.

13:43.642 --> 13:45.398
Oh, I just need to grab my
phone of you for freedom.

13:45.399 --> 13:46.646
You grab what now?

13:47.526 --> 13:49.004
- Grab my phone.
- Is that what you want?

13:49.005 --> 13:51.142
Let me check something here.
Let me see.

13:52.151 --> 13:55.784
- As I suspected.  Zero missed calls.
- Okay.

13:55.785 --> 13:58.300
Why the hell would
she call you, dude?

13:58.317 --> 14:00.069
Because ...

14:02.011 --> 14:06.004
Because she is jealous.
No, no, because she is jealous.

14:06.005 --> 14:09.080
Do you remember last year I
went to that convention in Calgary

14:09.090 --> 14:11.754
and I posted that photo with that girl
with a red head and chain all around me,

14:11.755 --> 14:14.806
and Rachel got like weird and jealous and
she called me like 15 times that night.

14:14.852 --> 14:15.952
Do you remember that?
You remember that?

14:15.953 --> 14:18.305
No, why the hell
would I remember that?

14:18.306 --> 14:21.357
- God sake!  Give me the phone.
- Well, take it!

14:21.358 --> 14:23.924
- I'm trying...
- Why do I keep pointers. Exact same thing.

14:23.925 --> 14:25.554
Hey, I don't think
this is a funny game!

14:25.653 --> 14:28.094
- It's there. It's in the ceiling with God.
- It is?

14:28.652 --> 14:30.852
That's funny!
You're very funny.

14:41.137 --> 14:42.469
- Jordan.
- What?

14:42.470 --> 14:46.338
Jordan, I think it's best
if we do not speak.

14:46.373 --> 14:51.996
What? What honey, I can't hear you, man.
Dandak thrown this crazy party for me...

14:52.031 --> 14:55.903
and it's hopping man, it's hopping.
And there's all these girls here...

14:56.487 --> 15:01.812
Ah there's this one girl Tanya. She's
in real estate and she's all over my...

15:03.279 --> 15:08.080
Hey Rach ... Is that a gentle time
playlist playing there. Are you...?

15:09.029 --> 15:11.229
<i>Are you with someone?</i>

15:11.488 --> 15:15.691
Look, I think we just wait
to talk until you get back.

15:16.113 --> 15:18.083
- Okay?
- Great. Yeah, okay good.

15:18.084 --> 15:22.351
Okay that's a good idea.  Is there
somebody there in there with you?

15:22.480 --> 15:25.470
You.. You're so bad.
Get down.

15:26.388 --> 15:28.389
Hello?

15:28.779 --> 15:30.780
Rach?

15:49.698 --> 15:52.220
- Hello!
- Hi.

15:52.240 --> 15:55.369
I was a bit weird before
and I'm sorry for that.

15:55.370 --> 15:56.916
So now what?
You're cured?

15:56.923 --> 16:01.150
Well, I'm feeling a lot
better than I was then.

16:01.290 --> 16:05.140
So hoping we could maybe
start over you and I.

16:05.948 --> 16:09.837
- Ah.  Okay.
- Okay.

16:09.872 --> 16:13.815
Thank you.
I'm Jordan. I'm an accountant.

16:13.907 --> 16:18.611
- Tanya, real estate.
- Pleasure to meet you.

16:19.199 --> 16:23.644
Tanya real estate.
Can I ask you a personal question?

16:25.432 --> 16:27.433
Okay.

16:27.566 --> 16:29.686
Could we take some
sexy photos together

16:29.687 --> 16:32.392
so I can convince my
girlfriend to marry me?

16:36.224 --> 16:39.194
Put your arm around me like this,
and I'm gonna take a photo.

16:39.229 --> 16:40.733
Didi take quick photo!

16:49.925 --> 16:52.949
"Beauty & the Beast"
GENTLEMEN'S CLUB

17:20.534 --> 17:22.534
Excuse me!

17:25.618 --> 17:29.985
Excuse me. Pardon me.
I'm sorry. I couldn't help...

17:30.106 --> 17:34.168
These machines ...
the fees are astronomical.

17:35.577 --> 17:37.166
I want chips.

17:37.285 --> 17:39.726
Yeah, but they charge you a
fee here, a big one and then

17:39.727 --> 17:43.840
your bank charges is like hidden double
fee and it's just like not reasonable.

17:43.842 --> 17:47.101
Yeah, look man, when
a lady wants chips.

17:48.094 --> 17:49.294
Here!

17:49.869 --> 17:52.460
It's like a withdrawal
from the "Bank of Karma".

17:52.961 --> 17:54.388
You keep it.

17:54.661 --> 17:59.952
Oh no, seriously!  Here you just
like pay it for or whatever.

18:02.911 --> 18:04.911
Thanks.

18:09.416 --> 18:13.101
Spike, I need the lock-cutters.

18:13.221 --> 18:16.517
For fucks sake Julia, try
writing the combination down!

18:16.537 --> 18:20.985
I did. I wrote it on a gum wrapper
and I put it in my purse.

18:21.329 --> 18:23.406
But then I left that purse at home.

18:33.162 --> 18:37.180
- Three drink minimum.
- Right. Yes.

18:39.496 --> 18:43.377
- Don't give me the mean eye!
- Last time!

18:43.497 --> 18:46.296
It'll never happen again.

18:49.872 --> 18:53.287
See I think that's good one,
but I think we can do a better one.

18:53.788 --> 18:56.585
Who's up?
Your turn, baby!

18:56.705 --> 18:59.377
One.  Here's one for you.
We'll do a double shall we?

18:59.497 --> 19:05.157
Here we go. Here's your twenty.
One, two, three...  Ahh!

19:06.205 --> 19:09.215
You gonna eat that sandwich, Jules?

19:13.164 --> 19:16.242
You guys still like to drink or what?

19:16.581 --> 19:21.590
Oh wow, that is a very attractive one.
- Hey, handsome!

19:21.998 --> 19:26.675
That's the chicken man. You got
extra.  Extras, extras all around!

19:26.873 --> 19:29.436
Would you like to do
one more with daddy?

19:29.437 --> 19:32.430
You wanna dry hump?
I'm with...

19:38.165 --> 19:40.564
I hate my job.

19:42.858 --> 19:44.857
Oh please shut up.

19:56.707 --> 19:59.108
I want my pants.

20:01.025 --> 20:03.125
I want my pants...

20:09.292 --> 20:11.291
Help...

20:13.958 --> 20:16.991
Oh fuck you stupid "Karma Bank".

20:18.667 --> 20:21.466
Do you know where your pants are?

20:22.959 --> 20:27.972
- Is this your coat?
- Uh it's my coat...

20:29.292 --> 20:32.100
Wait! wait.
No no. No!

20:34.334 --> 20:37.756
- Where do you live?
- I miss my girlfriend.

20:37.876 --> 20:39.876
God!

20:48.418 --> 20:51.040
- I can't find a local address.
- No problem.

20:51.175 --> 20:55.115
We can drive around, waste off from
gas, all night long, until he sobers up.

20:55.135 --> 20:56.685
- No problem.
- What do you want me to do?

20:56.686 --> 20:59.657
- I don't know, cigaretto.
- I'm not dragging him back out there.

20:59.692 --> 21:01.885
- He's not mine.
- He's not mine.

21:09.794 --> 21:13.768
Hey ... I'm gonna let
you sleep on the couch.

21:14.494 --> 21:18.183
Oh God.  But listen up.
I like to cook ...

21:18.202 --> 21:22.450
So I have knives.
Sharp, dangerous knives.

21:22.628 --> 21:26.099
And if you try
anything, I'll cut you.

21:26.419 --> 21:30.058
- I will cut you in the face!
- You're a very good depressant. Thank you.

21:30.178 --> 21:32.804
- Schooch!
- Alright, let's go.

22:09.213 --> 22:11.613
New Balance $ 11,390.52

22:13.380 --> 22:15.380
Hello.

22:20.155 --> 22:22.460
Fuck.

22:36.364 --> 22:38.582
You don't have to do that.

22:40.389 --> 22:42.245
Sorry, I ...

22:42.265 --> 22:47.224
Happen to know why I smell faintly
of urine or where my pants might be?

22:47.358 --> 22:49.773
Great mystery!

22:51.590 --> 22:53.590
I looked there ...

22:57.048 --> 22:59.048
Here, you can keep 'em.

22:59.782 --> 23:03.197
I should probably just clarify.

23:03.507 --> 23:07.746
- I'm not real good with alcohol, I I...
- You don't say.

23:08.715 --> 23:10.275
Thank you for taking me in.

23:10.276 --> 23:13.318
That was very kind of you.
You didn't have to do that.

23:13.383 --> 23:15.847
Ah, yeah, I did actually.

23:17.465 --> 23:21.945
- Are you on vacation here or something?
- Yup, 10 days every year.

23:21.966 --> 23:25.648
One of the many perks of being
an accountant at my firm.

23:29.549 --> 23:33.376
- Would you care for some Biscardi?
- Oh, uh ...

23:34.841 --> 23:37.673
Yeah, thank you.
My stomach is totally empty.

23:40.092 --> 23:41.930
Wow. This is really...
Where did you get these?

23:41.931 --> 23:43.590
I baked them, last night.

23:43.634 --> 23:47.529
Here, you can have some for later.

23:48.383 --> 23:51.207
- You made these?
- For the road.

23:51.342 --> 23:54.480
Oh, no, no, no!
You don't want to get coffee on these.

23:54.600 --> 23:58.411
You should really file these.
You should file all these.

24:00.392 --> 24:04.740
I'm sorry, you probably don't want me
handling your private financial documents.

24:04.760 --> 24:07.090
- Oh, I don't care.
- Really?

24:07.226 --> 24:10.314
Because I couldn't help noticing, you
know when I was looking for my pants.

24:10.448 --> 24:14.806
I took a quick peek and ...
Do you know how much trouble you're in?

24:14.826 --> 24:18.074
This is what we would call in the
accounting world a "claustrofuck".

24:18.351 --> 24:21.098
- Have you considered a line of credit?
- Right, ...

24:21.118 --> 24:24.773
because banks love giving
money to strippers?

24:24.794 --> 24:28.432
Oh, no!  They won't care as long as you
have assets. Do you own anything of value?

24:28.552 --> 24:31.949
Oh well!  Like this condo.
It's my dad's inheritance.

24:31.951 --> 24:34.993
Oh yeah!  Any bank will
give you a line of credit, okay.

24:34.994 --> 24:36.378
If you decide to pay off your debt.

24:36.379 --> 24:39.619
Life is too short.  I don't waste
time worrying about money.

24:40.211 --> 24:43.082
- You're looking for... You have your coat?
- I was looking for my...

24:43.402 --> 24:45.402
Thank you.

24:48.136 --> 24:50.136
Oh, yeah!

24:51.545 --> 24:54.967
Hey!  Can I ask your professional
opinion about something?

24:54.987 --> 24:59.102
Which of these women appears
to be the most attracted to me?

25:01.902 --> 25:04.046
What are you trying to do exactly?

25:04.082 --> 25:08.213
I proposed to my girlfriend
and... she dumped me.

25:08.348 --> 25:11.983
So I thought I would make her jealous

25:12.203 --> 25:15.536
by showing her how much fun
I was having in Toronto

25:15.538 --> 25:21.553
and showing her that women find me
sexually attractive or something.

25:21.946 --> 25:23.934
Oh my God.

25:24.053 --> 25:26.057
- Okay, sit down.
- Thank you.

25:26.345 --> 25:30.432
Don't have anyone to talk to. It has been
a very difficult time and I would like ...

25:30.804 --> 25:32.804
Oh!  What are you doing?

25:33.121 --> 25:34.706
I'm going to give you a photo.

25:34.707 --> 25:38.783
Gonna make your girlfriend so wet,
she's gonna get a yeast infection.

25:39.096 --> 25:41.496
- Ahh.
- For the "Karma Bank".

25:42.472 --> 25:44.472
Okay.

25:44.872 --> 25:46.760
Make it... A little up more.

25:46.880 --> 25:48.880
- Like this?
- Yeah.

25:49.513 --> 25:51.914
- Okay, say "cheese".
- Cheese.

25:52.989 --> 25:58.020
- I'm Julia, by the way.
- Oh hey, I'm Jordan.

25:59.164 --> 26:00.324
Oh my God!

26:00.464 --> 26:03.054
It's really good. Thank you.
Thank you for that.

26:03.223 --> 26:05.878
And thank you for everything.
Really, my...

26:06.140 --> 26:08.351
- Sure, no problem.
- Coffee, thank you for that

26:08.352 --> 26:13.215
and thank you for this.
Really, really this is... wow!

26:16.390 --> 26:18.797
Okay, I will go.

26:19.556 --> 26:21.805
- Good luck!
- Bye.  Thank you.

26:38.765 --> 26:41.189
Okay, any... second now.

27:01.891 --> 27:04.806
Kate you know ... hold on.
Sorry!

27:05.042 --> 27:08.148
Here.  You want to
just um... try this?

27:09.041 --> 27:11.042
Thanks!

27:19.183 --> 27:22.030
Oh, that's... Oh I'm sorry!
Wait. Hold on.

27:22.431 --> 27:25.027
Got it right here.
Yup, that's me.

27:28.875 --> 27:30.224
Fucking serious?

27:34.076 --> 27:36.075
I need to call.

27:53.209 --> 27:55.824
- Hey baby!
- Do you think that I'm an idiot? Huh?

27:55.944 --> 27:57.637
Cause that girl's like super hot!

27:57.657 --> 28:01.322
Oh great!  So if I sent you a shot
of me having sex with an ugly girl

28:01.323 --> 28:03.462
- then you would have bought that?
- Yeah, actually.

28:04.177 --> 28:06.031
Is this your version
of leaving me alone?

28:06.032 --> 28:07.731
Cause I don't get it.
What are you trying to proof?

28:07.766 --> 28:11.449
No, I just wanted you to see how
much fun I'm having here in the big city

28:11.450 --> 28:13.500
and the T dot O dot plan.

28:13.501 --> 28:16.775
Did you actually hire a model
to try to make me jealous?

28:16.895 --> 28:22.165
Oh my God, did you hire that girl in
Calgary dude?  What's wrong with you?

28:22.186 --> 28:24.438
I miss you and I
just want to start over.

28:24.439 --> 28:26.565
This is so stupid.  Let's just...

28:26.686 --> 28:30.483
- I'll come back to Winnipeg. We'll go on a date.
- You want to come over... and then what huh?

28:30.603 --> 28:33.234
Take me home, undress me
and put me to sleep?

28:33.235 --> 28:36.723
No, thanks, I'm telling you.
Those days are over.

28:36.853 --> 28:40.000
- Well, I can change, okay!
- Look, okay. Yeah. You want to change?

28:40.020 --> 28:43.682
If you find some special potion that
magically makes you better in bed

28:43.683 --> 28:45.557
then look me up
otherwise you know what?

28:45.558 --> 28:48.668
Just leave me alone, okay?

28:49.146 --> 28:52.178
Jesus!  Yeah, you know what ...?

28:59.987 --> 29:02.642
- Hey, buddy.
- So I met this stripper named Julia

29:02.663 --> 29:05.366
and she took this like really sexy
photos of me.  And I sent them to Rachel.

29:05.386 --> 29:09.691
Rachel got really pissed off.
So, oh man you're right! You're right!

29:09.771 --> 29:12.499
I need you to teach me
how to fuck real good!  So...

29:12.500 --> 29:16.903
Reshma, this is Jordan. He's obviously
got an unusual sense of humor, dude.

29:16.908 --> 29:18.300
Nice to meet you, Jordan.

29:18.301 --> 29:24.516
Listen.  After several failed attempts
by my parents, they did it.  They did it!

29:24.551 --> 29:26.425
Rachel, she's never going to marry me.
She's not going to marry me.

29:26.426 --> 29:28.082
She wants the most...
You teach me how to do sex stuff.

29:28.083 --> 29:30.015
All the sex stuff.  All of it.

29:30.664 --> 29:33.237
What?  How could I
ever help you with that?

29:33.238 --> 29:35.410
What do you mean?  How
could I ever help you with that?

29:35.445 --> 29:39.817
- Duh! You said you'd be my sexual mentor.
- Spiritual... Spiritual mentor!

29:40.018 --> 29:44.682
Not... not sexual.
Spiritual... You misheard.

29:44.717 --> 29:47.611
- I need you to show me how to bang!
- I don't think so...

29:47.939 --> 29:51.184
Excuse me, um...
I'm just going to freshen up.

29:51.185 --> 29:52.603
- Okay.
- While you two talk.

29:52.604 --> 29:54.779
Sure.  Great!
Hey, listen to me.

29:55.699 --> 30:00.498
- I'm gonna miss you.
- Not as much as I'll miss you.

30:01.023 --> 30:03.024
Go.

30:06.599 --> 30:07.864
- Why are you trying to ruin my life?
- What?

30:07.865 --> 30:09.346
I'm sorry.
Not your fault, dude.

30:10.299 --> 30:14.212
- I fell so hard last night.  It's crazy.
- What? So hard. That's not possible.

30:14.247 --> 30:16.212
You don't fall hard.
You're a man whore, man!

30:16.333 --> 30:19.550
No, listen to me. I was... was a man
whore.  This girl, I mean, we're like...

30:20.566 --> 30:26.071
Sipped tea till like 3 in the morning. We
came back here, I bared my soul to her.

30:26.090 --> 30:28.731
And then as the sun
came up, we made love.

30:28.900 --> 30:29.933
You said you made love?

30:29.934 --> 30:33.245
Yes, this morning we like lay
in each others arms, okay.

30:33.650 --> 30:38.071
Follow me on this.  My penis was not
inside her vagina.  It was amazing.

30:38.191 --> 30:40.231
- That's called "cudzealous"?
- Cuddling.

30:40.400 --> 30:42.430
Right, wow man.
It was like...

30:42.493 --> 30:46.356
you know, waking up from her long
nap, and eating crete scrambled eggs,

30:46.390 --> 30:49.114
and being tucked in by your mom
and like peeing in the bath.

30:49.233 --> 30:51.976
All at the same time and even better.
But here's what I want you to know.

30:52.766 --> 30:55.601
Reshma is from a very, very,
very, very traditional family.

30:55.602 --> 30:58.757
She can never know anything
about my dirty, weird, wild past.

30:58.792 --> 31:00.231
You said you bared your soul to her.

31:00.232 --> 31:02.710
Well, yes I did, except
for one tiny omission.

31:02.801 --> 31:05.026
Technically thousands
of gigantic omissions...

31:05.027 --> 31:07.136
No no no no no!
I need the old Dandak back, okay.

31:07.171 --> 31:10.351
The old Dandak got to teach me his
tricks and go out and talk to girls for me

31:10.352 --> 31:12.469
and have them sleep with
me so that I can get better ...

31:12.551 --> 31:14.165
No, I have to
concentrate on this, okay.

31:14.166 --> 31:16.829
You need to consider that
Dandak gone right now.  Okay?

31:16.830 --> 31:20.204
- No, I can do this by myself then.
- No you absolutely cannot...

31:20.205 --> 31:22.837
do this by yourself, alright.
You need intensive training.

31:22.838 --> 31:25.256
- You need like a Jedi master.
- Yes, yes, I need a Yoda!

31:25.257 --> 31:26.140
Yes a Yoda.

31:26.141 --> 31:30.524
Except more more *** things like, the
four quadrants of the clitoris or the ...

31:30.543 --> 31:33.660
What's it for...?  Quadrants?
What is that? What is that?

31:34.086 --> 31:37.761
Okay listen to me.  The human
female clitoris has four quadrants.

31:38.903 --> 31:42.758
Fast forward okay. When one is stimulating
said clitoris manually or orally

31:42.793 --> 31:46.636
one must focus one's attention
on the upper left quadrant.

31:46.686 --> 31:48.082
- Say it back to me.
- The upper left quadrant.

31:48.083 --> 31:50.437
How is that possible?  The whole
thing is like microscopic to start with.

31:50.438 --> 31:52.100
How do you then divide
into four then target...?

31:52.102 --> 31:56.451
That's when you know.
You just know.

31:57.646 --> 32:00.697
Oh!  Hi.

32:01.111 --> 32:06.304
Listen to me.  You can never
go to the bathroom alone again.

32:06.719 --> 32:09.969
I missed you way too much.

32:12.029 --> 32:14.029
I won't.

32:31.363 --> 32:34.654
There is a difference between
a stripper and a prostitute.

32:35.863 --> 32:38.000
Okay, to be fair there's
a lot of girls in my work

32:38.001 --> 32:41.153
who would have sex with you for
money, but it's just not my thing.

32:41.181 --> 32:44.738
No no no no!   Of course I
know you're not a prostitute.

32:44.773 --> 32:48.716
Okay this morning when
I was here, I peeked in your ...

32:49.957 --> 32:52.372
... your things.

32:55.496 --> 32:58.605
Oh my God!  You can't
even say "vibrator"!

32:59.406 --> 33:02.177
Yes, I own a vibrator.

33:02.326 --> 33:05.647
And I also have various lubricants.

33:05.864 --> 33:08.826
I occasionally enjoy
watching some porn.

33:08.827 --> 33:11.163
I mean, I don't know what
any of this has to do with...

33:11.198 --> 33:13.001
Seriously.
This is exactly what I mean.

33:13.039 --> 33:16.426
Look at you.  You're just like
so comfortable with yourself.

33:16.498 --> 33:21.552
And so confident you know.  It's this
confidence that I... has eluded me.

33:21.673 --> 33:24.478
I'm really sorry about your girlfriend
and your whole situation,

33:24.497 --> 33:29.052
but the bottom-line is just that...
I don't need any help.

33:29.245 --> 33:34.299
I... it's under control,
so... thanks anyways.

33:34.532 --> 33:38.198
Julia, this is a "classic fuck".

33:46.683 --> 33:49.483
They canceled my credit cards.

33:53.324 --> 33:56.365
See?
See, this is what I'm saying.

33:56.616 --> 34:00.521
Okay, we need to get this straight
now... before it gets even worse.

34:00.541 --> 34:03.352
But it is not too late, because
I can help you right now, okay.

34:03.372 --> 34:06.611
I can help you set up that line of
credit and consolidate your debts.

34:06.659 --> 34:11.552
- Okay, okay fine.  I'll be your sexiator.
- Really?  You mean it?

34:13.500 --> 34:16.440
Okay! This is great!
So I'm only here for five days.

34:16.449 --> 34:20.399
Alright, I thought we could start maybe
with some pointers, right?  Some tips.

34:20.574 --> 34:23.822
- What are you doing?
- Taking out my ...

34:25.199 --> 34:27.400
Oh, no. No that's not...

34:27.993 --> 34:30.856
No you think that I'm ...
I didn't mean to imply ...

34:31.076 --> 34:34.554
I was thinking it would be like
a class... like instructional right,

34:34.676 --> 34:38.504
like teachers do and
mentor... it's like Yoda.

34:38.641 --> 34:41.081
Yoda didn't fuck Luke Skywalker.

34:41.201 --> 34:45.034
He rode around on his back and taught
him how to move things with his brain.

34:45.243 --> 34:49.491
- So they kept their pants on, right?
- Yes, they kept their pants on.

34:49.511 --> 34:53.949
Mm, let's figure out how to save my ass.
Tell me what the first step is.

34:54.068 --> 34:57.016
Let's get that ball rolling and then
we can work on your problem.

34:57.036 --> 34:59.714
Okay, first step.  I'm meeting
with your bank manager.

34:59.715 --> 35:01.116
I have a bank manager?

35:01.151 --> 35:02.868
Yeah, I mean you have
a bank account, right?

35:02.869 --> 35:05.022
- Yeah.
- Yeah, you have a bank manager.

35:05.057 --> 35:08.999
Okay, if I can just like... I just
call him up and ask for a meeting?

35:09.000 --> 35:12.982
Yeah, it's really easy. You just call the
number on the back of your card and...

35:13.661 --> 35:15.661
- Really?
- Yes!

35:28.878 --> 35:32.306
These are just a pair of labias.

35:32.916 --> 35:37.167
Labi ... Labii ...

35:38.937 --> 35:44.037
Labia.  Big pink vibrator.

35:53.712 --> 35:56.858
They gave me a meeting for tomorrow!

35:58.371 --> 35:59.834
- Rub and tug!
- What?

35:59.835 --> 36:03.533
That's a good idea!
Lesson 1.  Let's go.

36:03.568 --> 36:06.504
LESSON 1:
Rub and Tug.

36:07.497 --> 36:10.948
- How I can I help you today?
- We today...

36:12.080 --> 36:14.535
would like...

36:17.289 --> 36:20.755
- A massage?
- Yes, a massage.

36:20.813 --> 36:24.059
A sexual massage.

36:24.080 --> 36:27.880
$ 40.  Anything else is extra
and is discussed in the room.

36:28.223 --> 36:29.991
Wait over there while
I take your boyfriend.

36:29.992 --> 36:30.783
Okay, see you later.

36:30.784 --> 36:34.018
Wait wait wait wait.
She's coming in with me.

36:34.053 --> 36:36.850
Sorry, hon, more than 2 people
in the room, it's against the law.

36:36.851 --> 36:37.973
That's against the law?

36:38.498 --> 36:42.459
Well, I guess, this wasn't
meant to be.   It's too bad.

36:42.660 --> 36:43.809
Really?

36:44.748 --> 36:47.586
Okay, whatever you say, boss.  Let's
go back to my place and get to work.

36:47.706 --> 36:49.706
Wait!

36:50.815 --> 36:53.972
I don't understand how this is
supposed to make me better at sex?

36:58.081 --> 37:01.105
Ok ok ok, I'm ready.

37:07.416 --> 37:10.648
- Do not come.
- Excuse me?

37:11.249 --> 37:15.796
These women, they are trained to make
you blow your wad as quickly as possible.

37:15.916 --> 37:20.362
If you can hold your load with her,
you can hold your load with anyone.

37:20.582 --> 37:23.140
Beware okay.
They will have tricks.

37:23.624 --> 37:25.625
Powerful tricks.

37:43.142 --> 37:45.742
Hey honey, I'm Sapphire.

37:46.167 --> 37:50.130
That's not your real name.  Alright.
You people don't use your real name.

37:50.250 --> 37:54.898
I don't mean "you people".
I mean not a racist kind of way.

37:55.017 --> 37:57.395
I'm Jordan... Kevin.
I'll be Kevin.

37:57.415 --> 37:59.652
- Is this you first time, honey?
- No.

37:59.673 --> 38:03.829
I had a hot stone massage
once in a resort hotel in Mexico.

38:03.849 --> 38:06.220
And the hot stones were
very hot and burned my back.

38:06.221 --> 38:08.304
You know what?  I'm actually
feeling a bit nauseous.

38:08.339 --> 38:10.798
Oh just relax, Kevin.
It's just gonna be great.

38:10.799 --> 38:11.899
Yeah.

38:22.185 --> 38:25.209
Is this table sanitary?

38:25.377 --> 38:28.557
Yup, all of the soiled linen
are thrown right over there.

38:55.420 --> 38:57.420
Okay.

38:58.629 --> 39:00.628
Here we go.

39:11.087 --> 39:15.354
- Oh, do you want to look at my tits?
- No, thanks, I'm good.

39:18.462 --> 39:24.318
Okay... Oh she gonna climb.
Climb right out.

39:27.129 --> 39:29.130
No.

39:29.629 --> 39:31.711
No, no, no.

39:32.338 --> 39:34.338
No! No, no, no.

39:36.755 --> 39:39.380
Puke. Vomit.

39:40.245 --> 39:43.274
Sick.  Burnt victims.
People on fire.

39:43.310 --> 39:45.727
Very bad skin. Faces are burned.

39:45.862 --> 39:48.289
Their faces are very burned.

39:48.681 --> 39:50.568
No ...

39:50.588 --> 39:54.104
Alright baby, you got a real big
cock there.  It's looking really good.

39:54.722 --> 39:56.922
- Good job.
- Mom!

39:57.172 --> 40:03.045
Come in my mouth, baby.  Spray
your hot jizz all over my face.

40:04.322 --> 40:05.660
No, no, no!

40:05.680 --> 40:09.178
Need some help baby, you
want me to squeeze your balls?

40:09.298 --> 40:11.298
No! Please no!

40:12.048 --> 40:14.628
Oh my God, ouch!
My fucking eyes!

40:16.140 --> 40:18.139
I'm sorry!

40:18.823 --> 40:21.224
Violation in Room 3.

40:21.756 --> 40:24.603
- That's your boyfriend.
- He's not my boyfriend.

40:25.923 --> 40:29.179
- Are you okay?
- Oh my God.  Break my nose!

40:29.299 --> 40:32.721
- Oh my God, what are you doing?
- Nothing...

40:42.707 --> 40:44.479
- Does it hurt?
- Ow!

40:44.499 --> 40:47.457
Oh my God!  You're
such a baby. You barely ...

40:48.858 --> 40:50.857
Hey.

40:51.907 --> 40:55.866
I'm afraid that we're not going
to be able to use the condo

40:55.867 --> 40:57.909
as collateral on the line of credits.

40:57.944 --> 41:01.484
- Why not?
- Our record show that in 2008,

41:01.641 --> 41:06.899
Ms Bowe borrowed on her mortgage to make
a series of cash purchases that totaled

41:07.558 --> 41:10.138
just over $ 70,000.

41:10.258 --> 41:13.306
And you fail to mention this?
Why exactly?

41:14.508 --> 41:18.988
You said, as long as I owned my condo,
that the bank would give me a loan.

41:19.009 --> 41:23.447
Yes, but you left out a tiny detail
about borrowing against your...

41:23.467 --> 41:28.050
I didn't even remember until just
now when this guy brought it up.

41:29.092 --> 41:32.753
And... in fact what happened here was

41:32.932 --> 41:37.442
that I called the number on the back of
my credit card to ask for more money

41:37.463 --> 41:40.057
and there was a woman
on the phone who said:

41:40.177 --> 41:43.553
Uh, you qualify for a
some mortgage thingy

41:43.574 --> 41:47.548
- so I was like ok and signed some papers.
- You know what, no problem.

41:47.667 --> 41:50.846
It's okay.  Plan B.
Alright.  No problem.

41:51.477 --> 41:56.766
- We'd like to apply for a loan, please.
- Excellent. That is an excellent idea.

41:56.885 --> 41:59.701
I like that.  Let's...
We can do that!

42:00.968 --> 42:04.259
I'll just get the paperwork
started here and...

42:04.894 --> 42:10.042
Ms. Bowe can let me know who
she'd like to have as her co-signer...

42:10.560 --> 42:12.482
About what now?

42:12.603 --> 42:14.766
Well, seeing you have
tied up on your asset,

42:14.767 --> 42:18.803
you need someone to co-sign for your loan
to assume equal liability as a guarantee

42:18.838 --> 42:22.091
that the bank will get their money
back if you fail to make your payments.

42:22.211 --> 42:25.218
- Standard.
- It can be anyone, really!

42:25.352 --> 42:27.039
As long as they have
a good credit rating

42:27.040 --> 42:29.848
and you've know them for
a minimum of five years.

42:30.262 --> 42:32.261
Five.

42:34.970 --> 42:37.818
Like, a parent is common.

42:38.512 --> 42:41.160
Or sibling.

42:42.829 --> 42:45.529
A friend, a friend will do.

42:49.145 --> 42:54.272
They are strippers.  So they have assets,
but not the kind you're talking about.

43:00.662 --> 43:04.458
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!
- I knew this was a stupid idea.

43:05.013 --> 43:08.935
- How much do you make in your job?
- I don't know.

43:10.264 --> 43:13.434
- Last night I made...
- Oh my God!

43:15.555 --> 43:20.621
- No, no, no. Ok, let's put it back in.
- Six hundred... ish.

43:20.741 --> 43:23.750
- Six hundred dollars?
- It was a slow night.

43:23.870 --> 43:26.024
We can get you straightened
out real quick, Julia.

43:26.025 --> 43:26.965
- Really?
- Yeah.

43:27.041 --> 43:29.313
I can take care of it.
I'll set you up on a budget.

43:29.314 --> 43:31.510
I'll review your expense
or crunch the numbers.

43:31.515 --> 43:36.705
We don't need a stupid bank, Julia.
Who needs... banks are for suckers, right?

43:39.731 --> 43:42.132
You have to try this.

43:42.972 --> 43:45.786
Come here. I got them from
the South Australian coast.

43:46.390 --> 43:49.656
Oh no, I don't really like those!

43:50.932 --> 43:54.624
- Have you ever tried oysters?
- No, I could just tell.

43:54.848 --> 43:56.848
Come here.

44:00.223 --> 44:02.607
- Oh my God.
- Okay, okay.

44:02.933 --> 44:05.778
- What do I do, I just...
- That's... well done.

44:07.349 --> 44:09.870
- Okay?
- Lemony.

44:09.991 --> 44:12.037
- Oh come on.
- No, it's good!

44:12.171 --> 44:14.195
- It's good.
- Right!

44:14.319 --> 44:16.271
It's okay!

44:16.391 --> 44:18.182
Sorry, I notice you don't seem to

44:18.183 --> 44:22.181
subscribe to the whole
"clean as you cook" philosophy.

44:22.583 --> 44:25.841
- It's not really priority for you.
- Uh mm.

44:26.833 --> 44:29.707
Don't be afraid to get dirty.
Come here.

44:29.743 --> 44:32.913
Oh, this is not bare
hands wash shrimp.

44:33.034 --> 44:36.132
No, my... the Jewish people were not
technically allowed to handle shrimp

44:36.133 --> 44:38.262
unless we're eating in
a Chinese restaurant.

44:38.297 --> 44:40.405
- Okay, come on, get in there!
- I am orthodox.

44:40.425 --> 44:44.059
- Get in there. Peel 'em off.
- Like this.

44:44.692 --> 44:50.055
Okay now... try...
Can we have some dirty talk?

44:50.943 --> 44:53.784
What?
I don't know if I can.

44:54.134 --> 44:56.175
Come on, try.
One dirty word.

44:57.737 --> 44:58.970
Moist?

45:00.011 --> 45:03.133
- Are you serious?
- Yeah, like: Oh baby, I'm so moist.

45:03.160 --> 45:07.360
- You're a guy, why are you moist?
- No, I'm not. Forget it. Fine.  Hard?

45:07.479 --> 45:12.095
- Used in a sentence.
- This is very hard for me.

45:12.326 --> 45:14.553
Weak, try again.

45:14.713 --> 45:17.892
- You making me so hard.
- I do?

45:18.027 --> 45:20.821
No, no!
Not for real.

45:22.186 --> 45:27.215
- Well, I'll be exactly as hard?
- My wiener. My dicky.

45:27.235 --> 45:29.274
Try a "cock".
- My cock?

45:29.394 --> 45:31.607
- What about your cock?
- My cock should be alright.

45:31.727 --> 45:34.382
- What do you want to do with it?
- Mm, insert it...

45:34.502 --> 45:37.966
- Tell me what you want to do with it?
- I want it near ...

45:38.186 --> 45:40.709
Come on, tell me what you want
to do with your big hard cock?

45:40.710 --> 45:41.910
Okay, I want to put my own cock...

45:41.986 --> 45:44.197
Tell me what you want to
do with your big hard cock?

45:44.198 --> 45:45.719
I'll slam it inside your pussy.

45:47.495 --> 45:49.995
Yeah, that wasn't bad.
It's okay.

45:57.345 --> 45:59.645
Delicious!
So good!

45:59.895 --> 46:03.025
It's so good!
How do you do this?

46:03.245 --> 46:06.448
I made sure the shrimps
are poached gently.

46:06.449 --> 46:07.449
The curry has to be
spicy but not too spicy.

46:09.228 --> 46:10.958
And the "Basmati".
That's the thing.

46:10.959 --> 46:13.959
I have this guy who gets it shipped
in from the Himalayan foothills

46:14.092 --> 46:18.437
which... that's the best 'Basmati' in the
world.  So... that makes a difference.

46:23.145 --> 46:25.146
Really?

46:25.837 --> 46:28.637
This is literally the best cheesecake
I've ever tasted in my life.

46:28.921 --> 46:32.129
I'm not kidding.  I'm sorry I keep...
Everything you make is a...

46:32.130 --> 46:34.230
Where did you train?
You must have trained.

46:34.232 --> 46:37.800
Did you go to culinary school, or
you worked as a professional chef?

46:37.806 --> 46:39.693
Well, you should.  I mean have
you thought about that?

46:39.694 --> 46:43.173
Have you considered
doing this as a career?

46:43.605 --> 46:45.605
No.

46:45.730 --> 46:49.354
- Oh my God!  You have!
- I have this idea.

46:49.704 --> 46:51.274
It's totally unrealistic,

46:51.275 --> 46:55.960
but I came up with this
restaurant called the "Aphrodisiac".

46:56.022 --> 47:00.188
Anise, dark chocolate,
with basil, honey, garlic.

47:02.422 --> 47:05.903
Classic wine bar with essential twist.

47:06.022 --> 47:08.653
- It's a great concept.
- Whatever!  It's just an idea.

47:08.773 --> 47:11.973
Hey. No!
It's really... It's a great concept.

47:12.697 --> 47:17.106
I've looked around, ok.  I've seen your
condo, seen all the stuff you collected.

47:17.273 --> 47:20.050
You may say that your idea is unrealistic,

47:20.051 --> 47:22.533
but I don't know,
it looks pretty realistic to me.

47:22.568 --> 47:24.810
Whatever.  As you can see
I'm not good with money

47:24.811 --> 47:28.429
so, it's kind of a prerequisite
starting a restaurant won't you say?

47:28.549 --> 47:31.855
You  know, well, you know,
maybe it's a vicious circle.

47:33.441 --> 47:38.280
Maybe you spend all this money on all
that stuff because you're unhappy

47:38.417 --> 47:41.565
in your career and you're
trying like fill the hole in your life.

47:41.600 --> 47:44.623
And you say you're bad with money,
because that gives you an out, you know,

47:44.624 --> 47:50.480
from taking a risk and trying something
that will make you really happy.

47:55.566 --> 47:59.357
Blah, blah, blah.
What do I...? Why am I even...?

48:00.942 --> 48:03.521
Psycho babble, I don't
know what I'm talking about.

48:03.899 --> 48:06.914
This is why I don't... drink.

48:06.947 --> 48:08.237
I start...

48:08.375 --> 48:11.355
I should probably get to work.
I got a lot of work to get through, okay.

48:12.217 --> 48:15.462
- Yeah, I got to get ready for work.
- Okay.

48:15.658 --> 48:18.858
- You're done with it.
- No, I'm going to hold on to this.

48:19.283 --> 48:22.298
- Good night.
- Thank you for dinner.

48:22.743 --> 48:25.143
Seriously.
Amazing dinner!

48:33.651 --> 48:35.651
Oh my God!

48:35.993 --> 48:39.375
Have you managed
to unfuck my "cluster"?

48:39.426 --> 48:42.277
I'm working on it, it's not
going to be easy though.

48:42.298 --> 48:46.197
With all your bills and your
credit card debts and your

48:46.318 --> 48:49.952
unopened notices from "Skeets Rental".
What is that?

48:50.086 --> 48:53.465
Oh I was told that if I rent my
furniture, I could write it off.

48:53.485 --> 48:57.423
- Well, did you do it?
- Well, would have if they pay my taxes.

48:58.577 --> 49:02.227
- Should I be worried?
- No, I'm going to handle all that.

49:02.346 --> 49:05.746
You just need to worry about following
this... budget cause I made it for you

49:06.053 --> 49:08.648
okay and making all
these quotas that work.

49:08.828 --> 49:11.859
And for God's sake, woman,
stop spending so much money!

49:11.985 --> 49:16.369
Okay, you can't spend $ 1,000
on white truffles from Tasmania.

49:16.505 --> 49:19.932
That's not... No no more.
Okay you gotta save your money.

49:20.185 --> 49:22.941
- Alright?  Alright?
- Okay!

49:23.142 --> 49:25.142
Look!

49:26.427 --> 49:27.863
My money.

49:33.778 --> 49:36.662
- Saved!
- Good!  Okay.

49:36.796 --> 49:39.428
So, we're gonna start with groceries.

49:39.470 --> 49:42.951
Okay, no more fancy smanzy
organic foods for you.

49:43.071 --> 49:47.482
Tomorrow morning you're going to
meet me at 10 am at "Extra Foods".

49:47.602 --> 49:49.602
"Extra Foods"!

49:51.821 --> 49:53.910
- You're serious.
- Yes

49:53.943 --> 49:56.196
- Hey, Jules!
- Hey.

49:56.996 --> 49:58.996
That's my neighbor - Naked Tom.

49:59.130 --> 50:02.733
Yeah, I'm making scrambled
eggs, but I'm out of eggs.

50:04.154 --> 50:06.800
A splash of cream.
Add just a splash.

50:08.263 --> 50:10.262
Ah, Jordan - Tom.
Tom - Jordan.

50:10.322 --> 50:13.142
- What's up Jordan?
- Hey, how is it going?
- Good.

50:13.747 --> 50:16.612
- Is there something wrong?
- No.

50:18.414 --> 50:20.609
You got a problem with
the naked male form?

50:20.610 --> 50:22.757
No, I'm not. I don't... No.

50:23.913 --> 50:27.094
Because you're avoiding direct
eye contact with my penis.

50:27.114 --> 50:32.011
Oh no!  I was just giving
you privacy, that's all.

50:32.032 --> 50:34.331
I mean... It has been cool.
It get pretty cool.

50:34.573 --> 50:38.197
Jordan, I don't mind you looking.
Go ahead.

50:39.031 --> 50:42.228
- Tom's got a beautiful penis.
- Ummph?

50:43.064 --> 50:45.311
Wow, it's a beautiful penis.

50:46.631 --> 50:48.413
Take a good long look.

50:52.839 --> 50:55.040
Superb.

50:55.215 --> 50:58.361
Sexual insecurity is so unattractive.

50:58.532 --> 51:02.395
What?  I just saw your another one of
your penis for an hour. What's that?

51:02.515 --> 51:05.762
A splash of cream, thanks.
Got it.

51:06.765 --> 51:11.365
- He's got issues, Jules.
- How's that?  I do not think I ...

51:13.265 --> 51:15.566
Do I have issues?

51:15.875 --> 51:19.430
Lesson 3:
Confronting Issues

51:36.683 --> 51:39.083
It looks good.

51:40.616 --> 51:43.475
Wow, this is crazy!

51:43.833 --> 51:46.033
Hey, let's go out!

51:46.201 --> 51:48.868
- You're in a dress.
- I know. But I'm thinking...

51:49.067 --> 51:51.034
I don't know.  If we're going
to do this.  Let's do it right.

51:51.035 --> 51:54.504
Let's experience it.  Let's take
it outside like in the world.

51:54.539 --> 51:57.637
And I'm only gonna do this once,
so why not go for it, right?

51:57.773 --> 52:01.772
- Quick, before I loose my nerve.
- I'll get your purse.

52:03.335 --> 52:07.092
I'm not even embarrassed!
Hi!  I'm wearing panties.

52:07.326 --> 52:11.928
I can't believe how good I feel.  And I
really feel kind of neutral, you know?

52:12.660 --> 52:16.233
Yeah. I mean it's like I'm
totally anonymous, you know?

52:18.202 --> 52:21.291
Did you hear that?  I think I just...
I think I just got objectified.

52:21.410 --> 52:24.823
- And you loved it!
- I did love it!  I loved it.

52:24.943 --> 52:27.361
Hey, gorgeous!

52:27.662 --> 52:30.663
Oh, she just touched my package!

52:31.361 --> 52:33.760
- Say "horny"!
- Horny!  What is that?

52:33.953 --> 52:37.721
Oh, no no no!  Excuse me,
I'm gonna need those photos.

52:37.875 --> 52:40.875
Oh, you can download it off my Blog.

52:41.068 --> 52:46.293
"Cock" slash @ blogspot,
double backslash dot CA.

52:46.454 --> 52:49.223
- I'm uploading them right now.
- No, wait wait wait wait!

52:49.344 --> 52:51.118
I'm not... I have
a girlfriend and she's...

52:51.119 --> 52:54.206
I'm really sure that your girlfriend
doesn't read cock slash.

52:56.379 --> 52:58.867
And besides you're anonymous.

52:58.937 --> 53:02.209
- You're completely unrecognizable.
- I am ain't I?

53:02.329 --> 53:05.144
Jordan?
Jordan Abrams.

53:07.870 --> 53:10.584
Rabbi Finkelstein?
Wow.  What are you ...?

53:10.920 --> 53:13.920
Oh, Esther and I are in town
for the week, visiting Osley.

53:14.240 --> 53:16.400
Yeah!

53:17.454 --> 53:19.891
No! No!
I'm sorry!

53:20.288 --> 53:22.720
I'm sorry.

53:23.820 --> 53:27.432
Scrotum just slap on...
Slap!

53:39.022 --> 53:42.842
...Married, had two boys and a little girl.
- Oh, how sweet.

53:43.731 --> 53:47.971
This is Julia, she's my client.
I'm here on business.

53:48.122 --> 53:52.322
- Right, right. Your accounting.
- Yeah, this is Rabbi Finkelstein.

53:52.756 --> 53:57.555
He was my Hebrew teacher and
he officiated at my "Bar Mitzvah".

53:57.699 --> 54:00.916
Right! Jordan sang so beautifully.

54:01.048 --> 54:04.824
His voice had to change as he
was able to hit all those high notes.

54:05.732 --> 54:09.955
Well, it's been really great seeing you
Rabbi, but we gotta get going so...

54:10.331 --> 54:11.837
Shalom!

54:11.956 --> 54:14.769
You're live on "CKND"
national television.

54:14.889 --> 54:18.270
It is a brisk autumn night
here in the provincial capital

54:18.490 --> 54:20.104
<i>hundreds of men and women,</i>

54:20.105 --> 54:24.621
<i>boys and girls of all ages from
enjoying a big night of debauchery...</i>

54:24.915 --> 54:28.170
Esther!
Look who it is!

54:28.290 --> 54:30.290
Jordan.
Jordan Abrams!

54:30.790 --> 54:33.920
Do you remember?
The accountant from Winnipeg.

54:34.291 --> 54:37.133
<i>Here on legendary Church Street
in downtown Toronto,</i>

54:37.134 --> 54:39.820
<i>the gay, lesbians and
transgender community,</i>

54:39.855 --> 54:43.114
<i>led by one of bank
accountant Jordan Abrams,</i>

54:43.310 --> 54:47.205
<i>celebrates in grandeur style.
I'm currently standing...</i>

54:48.174 --> 54:50.546
- Hello?
- Yeah!  It is you!

54:50.666 --> 54:54.071
- What? Whatever do you mean?
- Are you wearing a dress?

54:54.392 --> 54:57.090
No, I'm not.
I don't think so.

54:57.759 --> 55:00.738
You're on live television and...

55:00.858 --> 55:03.248
- What are you doing?
- Look, I can explain, okay.

55:03.374 --> 55:08.163
No, Rachel I'm confronting
my sexual insecurities and I'm...

55:08.225 --> 55:11.166
- Embracing your feminine quality.
- Embracing my feminine qualities.

55:11.275 --> 55:12.287
Who's that girl?

55:12.288 --> 55:14.488
What girl?  There's
no girl.  I don't know...

55:17.167 --> 55:19.411
No, wait. Rachel!
Rachel!

55:28.059 --> 55:31.840
Well, good night.  Hope to see
you in... over the high holidays.

55:31.960 --> 55:35.744
Don't worry, Jordan.
Your little secret's safe with me.

55:36.760 --> 55:38.660
Thanks.

55:39.751 --> 55:42.939
- He says you don't worry...
- Right.

55:43.501 --> 55:47.319
Well, I gotta go home and kill
myself now.  So, good night.

55:48.026 --> 55:52.485
We're still on for tomorrow
morning, right?  "Extra Foods"!

55:57.443 --> 56:00.047
- Hi, Mom.
- Hello, sweetheart.

56:00.181 --> 56:04.071
- How are you doing? Are you good?
- I am just fine.

56:04.252 --> 56:07.854
Aside the fact that
my son is a fagalot!

57:46.615 --> 57:48.586
Hey!

57:48.606 --> 57:53.123
I thought you weren't coming.
I got the shitty cheese!

57:53.149 --> 57:58.253
I'm going home to beg Rachel to
take me back before it's too late.

57:58.923 --> 58:04.041
- What about your side of the deal?
- You know your budget, you gonna do great.

58:04.066 --> 58:09.235
- Okay.  Good luck!
- No no, I need you now! Just...

58:12.841 --> 58:16.447
I called the agent this morning.
It is totally reasonable.

58:16.667 --> 58:20.261
It's the perfect location,
it's move in ready.

58:20.481 --> 58:23.908
- I can guess you'd take it, right?
- Yeah, I don't know.

58:24.128 --> 58:27.946
If I were your accountant, I'd advise you
against it, till you pay off your debts.

58:27.967 --> 58:30.234
You know, but I have
most of the furnishings

58:30.235 --> 58:31.860
and most of the
equipment in my condo, right?

58:31.867 --> 58:36.819
So, all I need is just like a crash
course, on just the basics,

58:36.842 --> 58:40.202
because I have
to act fast for this...

58:40.203 --> 58:43.752
No, I have a plane
I have to catch.  Sorry.

58:45.035 --> 58:49.847
So Rachel yells at you and you
scurry back on your hands and knees?

58:49.867 --> 58:51.934
You're going home a bigger
pussy than when you left.

58:51.935 --> 58:53.530
Oh, that's really nice.

58:53.532 --> 58:55.113
What's gonna happen
when you have sex?

58:55.414 --> 58:59.401
She's gonna be like fast asleep
before your ass hits the sheets.

59:01.384 --> 59:05.426
Did Luke Skywalker
bail halfway through?

59:06.159 --> 59:11.762
No, right. He went back to that swamp
place and he finished his training.

59:13.052 --> 59:15.521
And what happened
to Luke Skywalker?

59:15.722 --> 59:17.999
I don't know.  Cried a lot,
he got his hand cut off...

59:18.000 --> 59:22.151
He became next Jedi master, right?
Because he saw it through.

59:23.019 --> 59:27.019
Shut up, Jordan!  Just stop
frushing me and do what I say!

59:27.144 --> 59:29.154
Ok, I'm sorry.

59:32.077 --> 59:35.678
Seriously?
That was way too easy.

59:36.802 --> 59:38.802
Hey ...

59:40.644 --> 59:43.255
Oh my God, I know what you need.

59:43.420 --> 59:46.112
- My place, tonight 8.
- I can't come.

59:46.247 --> 59:48.473
- Be there!
- Okay.

59:48.736 --> 59:51.136
Suck in your ...

59:51.770 --> 59:53.416
There.

59:53.536 --> 59:56.347
Yeah, it's difficult to
imagine this ending well.

59:56.348 --> 59:57.348
Okay.

59:57.396 --> 01:00:01.100
You need to stop letting
people walk all over you.

01:00:01.220 --> 01:00:05.812
Tonight, you are the aggressor, okay?

01:00:11.120 --> 01:00:13.721
Do you trust me?

01:00:15.871 --> 01:00:17.871
Yeah.

01:00:24.021 --> 01:00:26.422
<i>This is why I want to die.</i>

01:00:26.687 --> 01:00:29.903
I wanna have our babies
right here on this couch.

01:00:30.821 --> 01:00:34.468
Don't want our babies
to die on this couch.

01:00:34.972 --> 01:00:38.657
I want this couch covered
with our then babies.

01:00:40.146 --> 01:00:43.229
- Who is this?
- Doesn't he have a key?

01:00:43.364 --> 01:00:45.805
- Yeah, I didn't give him the key.
- Why not?

01:00:45.939 --> 01:00:48.805
Wait right here.

01:00:56.755 --> 01:01:01.972
- What about Mr Dirty Santoz, huh?
- What are you doing here, Rach?

01:01:03.556 --> 01:01:06.186
- Okay, where is he?
- I don't know.

01:01:06.306 --> 01:01:11.261
- Maybe he's with that stripper!
- The girl from the photo she's a stripper?

01:01:11.473 --> 01:01:15.069
Ah yes, she's a stripper but it
sounds we think she's Yoda.

01:01:15.289 --> 01:01:18.089
Is Yoda?
What the fuck are you talking about?

01:01:18.556 --> 01:01:21.731
Okay.
Where is the strip club?

01:01:22.457 --> 01:01:25.336
- I don't know.
- Where is the strip club?

01:01:25.624 --> 01:01:28.810
Tighten.
Do it bitch!

01:01:30.640 --> 01:01:36.105
Okay now. Pretend I'm your boss. This is
your chance to finally get back at him.

01:01:36.224 --> 01:01:39.003
Dear Kelly, I'd really appreciate it,

01:01:39.004 --> 01:01:41.634
if you were nicer to me at work!
Thank you very much.

01:01:41.669 --> 01:01:45.735
Screw you, Abrams!  Okay.
You're an moron!

01:01:46.957 --> 01:01:50.240
- Don't you want to whip me now?
- Ah, right.

01:01:51.358 --> 01:01:54.860
Yeah, it's just that's not...
that's not really how she talks.

01:01:54.866 --> 01:01:57.374
Actually she... she usually like...

01:01:57.675 --> 01:02:01.019
usually she pretends likes I'm having
an emotional breakdown, you know...

01:02:01.075 --> 01:02:02.128
What's the matter?

01:02:02.408 --> 01:02:08.138
Well, are you leaking from your eyes
just a little baby going to cry?

01:02:08.258 --> 01:02:11.415
Yeah, yes, sort of like that,
but she taunts me, okay.

01:02:11.416 --> 01:02:14.027
She taunts me with like
feminine hygiene products.

01:02:14.062 --> 01:02:17.839
Do you need a maxi pad?
Do you need a sanitary napkin?

01:02:17.858 --> 01:02:23.125
Yeah, but that's not the term she uses.
- You need a fresh tampon for you...

01:02:31.668 --> 01:02:34.467
Three whiskey sours.

01:02:35.207 --> 01:02:38.806
- Excuse me. Sorry Julia around?
- Why?  You want to lap dance?

01:02:38.927 --> 01:02:41.326
- No, uh...
- Five bucks for breast massage.

01:02:41.447 --> 01:02:44.164
Ten for fingers banging
and fifteen for clit play.

01:02:44.497 --> 01:02:49.815
Clit. No!  Would you mind if
I had Julia's address, please?

01:02:53.194 --> 01:02:56.844
Gary is clearly making
personal calls on company time.

01:02:56.943 --> 01:03:01.637
You're mean Kelly!  Kelly, you're
a mean bully and I don't like you.

01:03:02.144 --> 01:03:05.143
Okay, now.
Pretend I'm Rachel.

01:03:05.378 --> 01:03:09.666
Rach, it's not fair that I'm not allowed
to have dairy products in the home

01:03:09.686 --> 01:03:13.066
just because you are lactose intolerance.
How is that fair?  I like yogurt!

01:03:13.086 --> 01:03:17.479
Do you think you could maybe dig a
little deeper?  Didn't this all hurt you?

01:03:17.514 --> 01:03:19.513
Yeah, she hurt me
but it wasn't her fault.

01:03:19.514 --> 01:03:21.526
Don't tell me, tell Rachel.

01:03:21.978 --> 01:03:24.271
Rach's, it's not your fault that

01:03:24.272 --> 01:03:27.668
you didn't develop romantic feelings
for me all those years.

01:03:27.729 --> 01:03:29.138
Now I knew you cared about me.

01:03:29.139 --> 01:03:32.748
Just not the way that I cared about you.
It's not your fault.

01:03:33.020 --> 01:03:36.948
I chose to stay in your life,
you know, and be with you ...

01:03:37.188 --> 01:03:41.994
Everyone I ever slept with, cut me loose.
Never talked to me again.

01:03:43.971 --> 01:03:46.551
After a while, you...

01:03:46.880 --> 01:03:53.837
start to think that maybe
you're... unlovable, I guess.

01:03:53.879 --> 01:03:57.507
But you never bailed.  Rach, you
never bailed in all those years.

01:03:58.562 --> 01:04:01.557
That's gotta mean something, right?
I mean, that's gotta...

01:04:02.338 --> 01:04:06.229
And so naturally, I figured,
you must be the one.

01:04:07.530 --> 01:04:10.331
Until sex entered the picture.

01:04:11.338 --> 01:04:17.313
- You're just like all the other girls...
- Well, I guess you're wrong about me.

01:04:17.781 --> 01:04:19.097
Cause I'm not the one.

01:04:19.098 --> 01:04:23.650
Shouldn't stop me from stringing
you along all these years, right?

01:04:23.685 --> 01:04:25.736
No, no no.  Don't say
that. That's not true.

01:04:25.956 --> 01:04:30.222
Didn't I know that you're actually
in love with me that whole time?

01:04:30.362 --> 01:04:33.168
Yeah, you knew but
what we suppose to do?

01:04:33.288 --> 01:04:36.989
And it must have known that it was
hard for you and that it's painful.

01:04:37.141 --> 01:04:40.784
And I suppose you didn't
have to share every detail

01:04:40.785 --> 01:04:42.730
about every one of your boyfriends
with me all those years.

01:04:42.731 --> 01:04:45.516
- I guess that wasn't necessary.
- I did, didn't I?

01:04:45.636 --> 01:04:49.199
And even though I knew it
was really torturous for you.

01:04:49.200 --> 01:04:51.365
You mean, like in 11th grade,
we're on a camping trip.

01:04:51.548 --> 01:04:53.677
You know when there're
almost raccoons everywhere

01:04:53.678 --> 01:04:55.676
and we were sharing
a tent together and...

01:04:55.711 --> 01:04:59.566
you met that guy with the goatee who
was playing guitar on the next campsite.

01:04:59.686 --> 01:05:01.960
You didn't have sex with the guy

01:05:01.961 --> 01:05:04.649
when I was lying right there
sleeping next to you in the tent.

01:05:04.707 --> 01:05:06.892
Especially considering you knew
that I was scared of raccoons

01:05:06.893 --> 01:05:09.508
and that I can't sleep
when I'm anxious!

01:05:17.141 --> 01:05:18.679
Thanks.

01:05:18.699 --> 01:05:21.799
And then Trevor dumps you.
Trevor dumps you last year, right?

01:05:21.823 --> 01:05:25.185
And you're feeling all like, bad about
yourself, and all heartbroken.

01:05:25.186 --> 01:05:26.186
So, where did you go?

01:05:26.283 --> 01:05:29.496
Good old Jordan. Good old Jordan.
He'll always be there.  You know.

01:05:29.516 --> 01:05:32.466
To use and take advantage of...

01:05:32.692 --> 01:05:36.566
No matter how many
times you break his heart!

01:05:38.775 --> 01:05:43.039
You selfish bitch!

01:05:43.259 --> 01:05:45.883
You never listen to me!

01:05:46.150 --> 01:05:48.950
You'll listen now!
Listen!

01:05:50.500 --> 01:05:53.507
Are you ready to listen to this?
Listen to this!

01:05:54.734 --> 01:05:57.931
I can't believe that I convinced
myself that you actually love me.

01:05:58.050 --> 01:06:00.714
You are incapable of love, Rachel!

01:06:00.735 --> 01:06:06.472
And when you are old, and alone
and fat and surrounded by cats

01:06:06.593 --> 01:06:08.205
you're gonna realize
what a mistake you've made

01:06:08.206 --> 01:06:10.388
what a massive mistake you've
made pushing me out of your life.

01:06:10.423 --> 01:06:12.956
Just because you didn't
like the way that I did it.

01:06:13.076 --> 01:06:16.365
Because no other guys are going to
put up with your crazy selfish bullshit,

01:06:16.366 --> 01:06:18.669
you insensitive cunt!

01:06:36.319 --> 01:06:38.319
Hey, Rach.

01:06:38.736 --> 01:06:40.737
Rachel!

01:06:42.086 --> 01:06:44.629
Rach!

01:06:54.331 --> 01:06:56.399
Wait!
Where are you going?

01:06:56.520 --> 01:06:59.383
This is the most romantic
thing you've ever done!

01:06:59.403 --> 01:07:02.260
How could you? Do you really
think those things about me?

01:07:02.261 --> 01:07:06.738
- You called me a cunt!
- No, I've been working on my dirty talk!

01:07:07.203 --> 01:07:10.087
I asked you a question.
Is that how you really feel?

01:07:10.088 --> 01:07:12.383
I need to know the truth right now.

01:07:12.946 --> 01:07:15.403
No! No!
It was just an exercise!

01:07:15.404 --> 01:07:17.840
Oh it's an exercise.
Yeah! An exercise in what?

01:07:27.129 --> 01:07:29.728
I'm doing this all
for you, Rachel. For us.

01:07:29.821 --> 01:07:32.120
- Dressing up like a woman!
- Shut up!

01:07:35.030 --> 01:07:37.788
So you didn't mean it?

01:07:38.779 --> 01:07:41.018
Selfish bitch thing.
Insensitive ...

01:07:41.039 --> 01:07:43.814
- Cunt, the part of me being fat!
- God, no!  No!

01:07:43.839 --> 01:07:48.529
I didn't mean any of that.
All I ever wanted is you, Rach.

01:07:52.489 --> 01:07:56.322
I need you.
Without you I am lost.

01:07:58.190 --> 01:08:01.806
- You are? Do you mean it?
- Yeah.

01:08:05.265 --> 01:08:06.807
Can we just go?

01:08:07.108 --> 01:08:11.068
Yes, let's just go!
Let's get out of here!

01:08:11.448 --> 01:08:14.703
Come on!  Wait! I just gonna
run upstairs and untie Julia, ok.

01:08:14.823 --> 01:08:18.727
Wait!  No!
Forget about her.  Let's go!

01:08:19.156 --> 01:08:23.162
Yeah!  She's bound and gagged, right.
So I'm just gonna run about 30 seconds.

01:08:23.282 --> 01:08:25.680
No, wait!
I'm serious!

01:08:27.116 --> 01:08:29.515
It's her or me.

01:08:30.741 --> 01:08:35.028
Are you saying that if I go upstairs
to untie my friend for like 30 seconds

01:08:35.063 --> 01:08:38.426
that you're going like
break up with me forever?

01:08:41.432 --> 01:08:43.432
Yeah.

01:08:43.991 --> 01:08:46.568
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
You're right.  Yeah.

01:08:47.782 --> 01:08:50.182
Yeah, you have to choose.

01:08:50.867 --> 01:08:54.090
Come on!
This week has been awful.

01:08:55.450 --> 01:08:59.041
You're my best friend.
You are my anchor.

01:09:01.492 --> 01:09:06.112
Fine, you're right, okay.
I made a mistake.

01:09:06.341 --> 01:09:09.591
So ... come on!

01:09:10.274 --> 01:09:12.688
Let's go home!

01:09:15.576 --> 01:09:19.779
I can't do that.  I'm not going to
leave her up there.  So... I won't.

01:09:20.399 --> 01:09:22.939
I hope that you'll be here in
30 seconds when I get back.

01:09:22.939 --> 01:09:24.876
You little fucker.

01:09:24.911 --> 01:09:28.988
You did mean those things.
I know, my God!  I knew you did.

01:09:29.009 --> 01:09:33.196
- Fuck you!  Fuck you!
- Fine!  So fuck you!

01:09:33.243 --> 01:09:37.514
Oh! Fuck you harder.
You even know... fuck you!

01:09:38.227 --> 01:09:41.450
You fucking motherfucker.
I'll fucking fuck you!

01:09:41.868 --> 01:09:47.256
You are fucking fuck!
...Fuck you?

01:09:47.477 --> 01:09:51.057
Hey!  You know what? Fuck you
you foxtress. You fucking foxtress!

01:09:51.077 --> 01:09:54.976
Go fuck yourself! You don't know how to
fuck anything, you fucking fuck fucker!

01:09:55.135 --> 01:09:59.190
- You fuck so bad!
- Fuck yourself, you fuck!

01:09:59.310 --> 01:10:01.507
- Fuck you!
- Fuck... you!

01:10:01.527 --> 01:10:07.009
Wait!  Wait!  I didn't mean it.
Wait!  I didn't mean it.  Wait...

01:10:16.699 --> 01:10:18.986
You're a fucking bitch!

01:10:26.162 --> 01:10:28.161
Hey, what's happening?

01:10:39.671 --> 01:10:41.871
Where were you?

01:10:43.521 --> 01:10:47.160
They came and they took everything.
How can they do that?

01:10:47.279 --> 01:10:49.906
- They took it all!
- They got a writ of seizure, okay.

01:10:49.941 --> 01:10:51.853
It should have taken them months.
I don't know how they got it so quickly.

01:10:51.854 --> 01:10:53.042
But they got one.
They got one.

01:10:53.046 --> 01:10:56.377
So that means they can just...
Wait!  Where are you going?

01:10:56.496 --> 01:10:59.703
- I'm going after Rachel!
- You said you'll take care this.

01:10:59.723 --> 01:11:02.501
Did you even read all their mail?

01:11:02.502 --> 01:11:05.078
That's not fair.  You can't
blame this on me, okay.

01:11:05.093 --> 01:11:08.402
It's not my fault that you rented
everything from some guy named Skeet

01:11:08.422 --> 01:11:10.087
and then you stopped paying them.

01:11:10.088 --> 01:11:12.893
But I asked you.
You told me not to worry!

01:11:12.943 --> 01:11:16.376
You told me from now everything,
except for my restaurant...

01:11:16.377 --> 01:11:19.210
I can get this of...
How can I else go on?

01:11:19.219 --> 01:11:22.363
I just told Rachel...
I said fuck you and sent her away...

01:11:22.580 --> 01:11:25.655
If I don't go after her, I'm gonna lose
her, ok.  I'm gonna lose her forever.

01:11:25.690 --> 01:11:28.305
So I'm sorry, if I can't help you
anymore with your little restaurant.

01:11:28.306 --> 01:11:30.859
I got to go.
Fuck!

01:11:34.414 --> 01:11:36.271
<i>I checked this morning and
they said there was a delay.</i>

01:11:36.272 --> 01:11:38.421
<i>I just checked now and
they said it was on time.</i>

01:11:38.798 --> 01:11:42.257
<i>So what is it?
Well, is it delayed or is it on time?</i>

01:11:42.399 --> 01:11:44.183
<i>Please, I'm trying to get
on a flight since last night.</i>

01:11:44.184 --> 01:11:45.897
<i>I'm on my way to
the airport right now.</i>

01:11:48.714 --> 01:11:51.962
Hold on a second.  Hey, can
you pull over right here, please!

01:11:56.374 --> 01:11:58.879
Hey just a...
Please wait here for 1 minute, please.

01:11:58.899 --> 01:12:02.081
Yeah man, no problem.
I live to serve you.

01:12:12.900 --> 01:12:15.766
Hey, are you still there?
Yeah, sorry about that.

01:12:15.900 --> 01:12:19.749
I... on second thought I would like
to get on that 3.30 flight instead.

01:12:24.941 --> 01:12:26.496
Thank you.

01:12:26.517 --> 01:12:27.420
Here.  Do me a favour.

01:12:27.421 --> 01:12:30.380
Would you please make sure that
she gets this when she comes in.

01:12:30.381 --> 01:12:32.133
Thank you very much.

01:12:48.376 --> 01:12:51.381
- You gonna be okay, Jules.
- Yeah.

01:12:53.359 --> 01:12:56.626
- How do you know?
- I've seen you dance.

01:12:57.526 --> 01:13:00.327
You're an amazing dancer.

01:13:00.459 --> 01:13:03.524
- Best stripper I've ever seen!
- Yeah.

01:13:13.585 --> 01:13:16.231
Hey, I got but one bag...

01:13:17.785 --> 01:13:21.757
I thought my co-signer had to
know me a minimum of 5 years.

01:13:21.878 --> 01:13:25.160
- Yeah, I lied.
- An accountant lying to the bank?

01:13:25.435 --> 01:13:28.336
Yeah, that's currently what we do.

01:13:29.053 --> 01:13:32.270
But you were right about Skeet, ok.
I didn't open all those notices.

01:13:32.293 --> 01:13:37.393
If I had, I could have, you know,
appealed them.  So I co-signed your loan.

01:13:38.013 --> 01:13:40.366
And you're good to go, right.

01:13:40.574 --> 01:13:43.656
Oh!  Don't worry, okay,
because legally Skeet

01:13:43.660 --> 01:13:46.510
he only have the right to take back his
furniture, not all your restaurant stuff.

01:13:46.533 --> 01:13:48.837
So, you know, you can just use
the rest of the loan money

01:13:48.838 --> 01:13:50.919
to get yourself a lawyer
and get all that back.

01:13:53.461 --> 01:13:56.040
Okay.
Thanks.

01:13:56.837 --> 01:13:58.918
Wait wait wait.
Wait, I...

01:14:00.379 --> 01:14:02.779
I know that I owe you a...

01:14:03.587 --> 01:14:06.836
Last night, I was a classic dick!
Okay, I was a dick!

01:14:07.421 --> 01:14:11.427
I know that.  I knew it then too.
I almost came back inside. It's just...

01:14:13.796 --> 01:14:20.295
I couldn't because I... was embarrassed.
I could not look you in the eye.

01:14:20.920 --> 01:14:24.543
I don't deserve a friend like
you, Julia.  I really don't.

01:14:26.338 --> 01:14:32.154
I failed you.  Old wise
green pointy haired one.

01:14:36.138 --> 01:14:39.218
- So you going after her, huh?
- Yup.

01:14:39.339 --> 01:14:42.802
- Can't learn it from a book, dumb-ass.
- What?

01:14:44.839 --> 01:14:46.883
Yeah, well, I couldn't
exactly have her

01:14:46.884 --> 01:14:49.835
falling asleep during
make-up sex now, could I?

01:14:53.306 --> 01:14:55.706
Do you have any fruit?

01:15:03.257 --> 01:15:06.656
Here rule number 1.
Don't worry about your hair.

01:15:06.740 --> 01:15:10.703
- Okay, let's see what you got.
- Okay.

01:15:11.089 --> 01:15:15.097
Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Slow down.
No.  Don't just pounce.

01:15:15.840 --> 01:15:20.482
Introduce yourself.  Slowly.
Just with you breath at first.

01:15:21.382 --> 01:15:25.001
And then, very gently ...
No, not a blow. Lick more of her.

01:15:26.907 --> 01:15:29.512
Like when you steam up
a window, you know, and then...

01:15:30.298 --> 01:15:33.543
Yeah, and then very
gently with your tongue ...

01:15:33.840 --> 01:15:37.072
No!  Gently.
Almost imperceptibly. Yeah.

01:15:38.883 --> 01:15:40.883
Okay, yeah, that's right.

01:15:42.341 --> 01:15:44.341
Yeah...

01:15:44.491 --> 01:15:48.763
- Is that good?  Am I doing that right?
- Rule number 2: No talking.

01:15:48.783 --> 01:15:50.783
Okay.

01:15:52.924 --> 01:15:57.307
Okay, whatever you just did right
there, don't ever do that again.

01:15:57.340 --> 01:15:58.256
Now...

01:15:58.658 --> 01:16:02.040
try long strokes, bottom to top.

01:16:02.175 --> 01:16:04.854
Consistent pressure.

01:16:06.075 --> 01:16:09.629
Okay, and when you sense
that the cantaloupe is ready,

01:16:09.630 --> 01:16:12.440
that means it's clitoris time.

01:16:12.976 --> 01:16:15.757
- You do know what that is, right?
- Mm hm.

01:16:15.878 --> 01:16:18.676
Up, up.  Yeah, okay.

01:16:22.635 --> 01:16:25.015
That actually looks pretty good.

01:16:26.343 --> 01:16:28.943
Okay, work the sides.
The sides.

01:16:29.093 --> 01:16:32.759
Hold off on direct contact.
Just flirt, tease.

01:16:34.586 --> 01:16:38.467
Whoa whoa, no no no! No sucking!
It's not a Jolly Rancher.

01:16:38.801 --> 01:16:42.620
Go back to what you were
doing before!  Gentle pressure.

01:16:43.136 --> 01:16:45.135
Yeah.

01:16:48.135 --> 01:16:51.763
Okay.
Yeah, that's...

01:16:52.761 --> 01:16:55.242
Yeah, you got it.

01:16:58.761 --> 01:17:03.395
You know, if you wanted to
I suppose you could...

01:17:03.587 --> 01:17:06.300
Really?
You'll be cool with that?

01:17:06.303 --> 01:17:10.633
- I mean because I think that might really...
- Help with the lesson? Yeah! Me too.

01:17:11.552 --> 01:17:13.039
- Okay?
- Okay, yeah.

01:17:22.178 --> 01:17:27.398
- I really appreciate this. You know I...
- Instructional.  Yeah, of course!

01:17:33.638 --> 01:17:35.637
Oh, yes!

01:17:36.679 --> 01:17:38.945
Yes, that's very good.

01:17:43.638 --> 01:17:46.237
Okay now, increase the pressure.

01:17:47.029 --> 01:17:50.998
Yeah! Okay don't stop doing that!

01:17:51.117 --> 01:17:53.176
- Keep doing!
- Should I just flip my tongue...?

01:17:53.196 --> 01:17:56.929
Rule number two!
Jesus! Oh!

01:17:58.513 --> 01:18:01.332
Okay, yeah, you're a natural.

01:18:01.514 --> 01:18:03.514
Yup.

01:18:11.097 --> 01:18:13.097
Yeah! Oh fuck!

01:18:13.764 --> 01:18:16.737
- Did you come?
- Oh! I burn!

01:18:16.857 --> 01:18:18.379
- What did I do? What did I do?
- Are you chewing gum?

01:18:18.380 --> 01:18:22.029
What? No!  I.. I.. Yes!
I wanted to have fresh breath.

01:18:22.030 --> 01:18:23.230
On my vagina?

01:18:23.247 --> 01:18:25.463
Sorry!  I was nervous!
What's going on?

01:18:25.464 --> 01:18:26.420
Don't you know
I'm allergic to mint?

01:18:26.422 --> 01:18:30.310
Allergic to mint?  Sorry!
Here.. here some water.

01:18:32.176 --> 01:18:34.712
- Shower!  Shower!
- That way! That way!

01:18:48.809 --> 01:18:52.015
- Are you all right? Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

01:18:52.174 --> 01:18:54.173
You feel better?

01:18:54.473 --> 01:18:57.307
I think you can kiss me.

01:19:37.767 --> 01:19:39.767
Excuse me.

01:19:47.476 --> 01:19:50.506
- Hey! ...?
- Sorry!

01:19:50.726 --> 01:19:52.925
Come here!

01:19:53.118 --> 01:19:56.548
What the hell are you doing up here?
Reshma wants to call the police!

01:19:56.668 --> 01:20:00.250
Sorry something just happened
in the bathroom, with Julia.

01:20:00.296 --> 01:20:02.218
Julia?  I thought Rachel
who came back for you.

01:20:02.219 --> 01:20:03.500
I thought you and she
were getting back together.

01:20:03.507 --> 01:20:04.449
No no, she's gone.
She left.

01:20:04.450 --> 01:20:06.350
Oh, for fuck sake.
How did you fuck that up?

01:20:06.351 --> 01:20:07.380
It's a long story, okay.

01:20:07.385 --> 01:20:09.927
Julia thought it was a good
idea if I tied her up and...

01:20:09.928 --> 01:20:11.533
You know what?  It doesn't look...
Why does it even matter?

01:20:11.534 --> 01:20:12.855
You don't even want me to be
with Rachel in the first place.

01:20:12.856 --> 01:20:15.486
Yes, I know, I know.
I said that. I just...

01:20:15.735 --> 01:20:18.014
You know, I'm realizing
something here.

01:20:18.135 --> 01:20:21.711
You and Rachel have weathered storms
together.  That's really important.

01:20:21.846 --> 01:20:26.243
This shit is just one more storm. Granted,
honestly, it seems like a giant hurricane.

01:20:26.377 --> 01:20:29.774
But, I was in New Orleans in
February and it looks fine to me.

01:20:29.894 --> 01:20:32.650
It sounds very insensitive.
When people of Louisiana wants to ...

01:20:32.651 --> 01:20:34.321
Wait! I've gone through a lot.
Just stop for a second!

01:20:34.352 --> 01:20:37.498
- Julia and I just had this moment...
- No, stop saying Julia! Stop saying Julia.

01:20:37.618 --> 01:20:39.134
Julia is field cricket.
She's not for you

01:20:39.135 --> 01:20:41.445
You have got to go
and get Rachel back.

01:20:42.961 --> 01:20:45.561
You can't come in.

01:20:45.836 --> 01:20:49.686
There is clearly
something going on in here.

01:20:51.395 --> 01:20:54.396
And it's something that I never ...

01:21:00.786 --> 01:21:04.058
You just have to tell me that you
feel it too and then I will let you in.

01:21:04.062 --> 01:21:07.682
<i>No, we need to pee.</i>

01:21:15.562 --> 01:21:17.859
- Sorry.
- No, it's alright.

01:21:17.979 --> 01:21:20.980
- Julia.
- Yeah, Dandak.

01:21:56.273 --> 01:21:59.273
Rach.

01:22:02.773 --> 01:22:06.231
I'm sorry, Rach.
Sorry.

01:22:07.340 --> 01:22:10.432
Too late.
Go away!

01:22:15.315 --> 01:22:18.944
I really want to make things right.

01:22:19.065 --> 01:22:21.064
I would like to ...

01:22:22.007 --> 01:22:24.407
<i>I love you, Rachel.</i>

01:22:24.690 --> 01:22:28.522
Those things you said, you were so mean.
That you don't love me.

01:22:28.657 --> 01:22:31.299
<i>You never loved me!</i>

01:22:45.391 --> 01:22:49.357
That's the receipt in the first time
we ever went for coffee together.

01:22:49.775 --> 01:22:52.524
<i>January 5, 1989.</i>

01:22:53.025 --> 01:22:57.895
You had the peppermint cocoa.
I had a herbal tea.

01:23:08.025 --> 01:23:11.877
"Dear Jordan, you make me smile.

01:23:12.551 --> 01:23:15.195
Thank you for being my friend.

01:23:15.317 --> 01:23:20.581
<i>You slipped that in my side textbook,
the day after your parents got divorced.</i>

01:23:20.801 --> 01:23:22.801
<i>Remember?</i>

01:23:23.010 --> 01:23:25.809
And you laughed.

01:23:35.193 --> 01:23:40.607
You remember in third year
you borrowed my dorm room

01:23:40.835 --> 01:23:46.636
so you could have sex with with
that jockey guy in the army shirt?

01:23:48.735 --> 01:23:49.772
Why did you keep that?

01:23:49.773 --> 01:23:52.443
You woke up the next
morning and he was gone.

01:23:52.903 --> 01:23:58.783
You cried in my arms for two days
straight.  Just crying in my arms.

01:24:06.036 --> 01:24:08.436
That's totally fucked up.

01:24:08.611 --> 01:24:12.859
Just weird, sad, pathetic, it's twisted.

01:24:13.278 --> 01:24:16.100
It's creepy.
That's really really creepy.

01:24:18.278 --> 01:24:20.678
And it's sweet.

01:24:25.570 --> 01:24:30.450
- While they were gone, I had sex.
- Yeah, I kind of figured. That's ok.

01:24:30.470 --> 01:24:33.670
With so many people.

01:24:37.579 --> 01:24:40.179
Are you ready?

01:24:58.196 --> 01:25:02.614
- Back in bed, lover-boy!
- Goodness!

01:25:02.780 --> 01:25:06.361
- Oh wow, thank you!
- You're welcome.

01:25:06.496 --> 01:25:09.135
- Have a raspberry.
- I will.

01:25:12.989 --> 01:25:15.388
Hang on a second here.

01:25:17.480 --> 01:25:21.611
Where did you find it?
When?  How this is ...

01:25:21.639 --> 01:25:24.607
Yes! Yes!
Let's get married!

01:25:26.022 --> 01:25:29.895
The engagement party is tonight.
I've been on the phone all morning

01:25:30.014 --> 01:25:32.560
and almost everyone's confirmed.

01:25:32.765 --> 01:25:35.603
- I love you!
- Oh my God.

01:25:35.723 --> 01:25:38.547
- I love you!
- I love you!

01:25:39.198 --> 01:25:42.197
- And I want more ...
- Okay!

01:25:43.390 --> 01:25:44.784
- Ok, that's good.
- I'm gonna go up.

01:25:44.785 --> 01:25:46.885
No, that's good! That's good!
Yeah, that's good.

01:26:19.050 --> 01:26:22.714
All these years slipping birth
control pills into you coffee,

01:26:22.833 --> 01:26:26.321
circulating memos about your
gender reassignment surgery

01:26:26.341 --> 01:26:30.232
I had no idea it was
actually true, Jordana.

01:26:31.167 --> 01:26:35.655
See what I did there?
Feminize your name by adding an "A".

01:26:37.994 --> 01:26:42.002
Look.  I don't care if you're gay,
bisexual or tritestical, whatever.

01:26:42.003 --> 01:26:43.835
You still get the same work load.

01:26:43.934 --> 01:26:45.086
Now that you see me as a woman,

01:26:45.087 --> 01:26:49.008
you're actually more attracted
to me than you were before this.

01:26:50.359 --> 01:26:53.160
That must be so confusing for you.

01:26:53.185 --> 01:26:56.085
I'm not attracted to you.

01:27:06.051 --> 01:27:09.052
The ring is beautiful!

01:27:13.751 --> 01:27:16.334
How is anyone expected to eat
a piece of cheesecake this size.

01:27:16.335 --> 01:27:18.493
It's way too big.
Get me your supervisor.

01:27:19.501 --> 01:27:22.504
- Mom.  Mom!
- Hurry. Quicker!

01:27:22.936 --> 01:27:26.836
Can you keep fussing with that?
Don't make me resort to the safety pins.

01:27:26.861 --> 01:27:30.791
- You remember the safety pins?
- I remember it!

01:27:39.336 --> 01:27:44.571
Oh, no!  Did you eat something like kiwi?
Okay, good.  Stop, stop.  Calm down!

01:27:45.369 --> 01:27:49.367
Alright, this is your little speech.
You'll do fine.

01:27:49.645 --> 01:27:53.077
Just say lovely things about me.
Right?

01:27:55.437 --> 01:28:00.052
Listen up, folks!
It's speech time.

01:28:00.229 --> 01:28:06.304
Everybody knows me as impulsive, fly by
the sea to my parents kind of gal. Right?

01:28:07.140 --> 01:28:11.740
But marrying this guy is hardly
impulsive.  It's just plain smart.

01:28:20.354 --> 01:28:24.358
Ladies and gentlemen, family and
friends.  Friedrich Nietzsche said:

01:28:24.388 --> 01:28:28.488
"The best friend is likely
to acquire the best wife

01:28:28.688 --> 01:28:32.689
because a good marriage is
based on a talent for friendship."

01:28:38.247 --> 01:28:44.397
Rachel and I are have been friends,
best friends since we were 12.  So...

01:28:53.395 --> 01:28:57.428
I think Nietzsche must have
married his best friend.

01:28:57.447 --> 01:29:02.605
Two.  I also believed he got
syphilis and he went crazy.

01:29:09.706 --> 01:29:13.939
I'm just choking! It's choking!
I'm choking. I'm choking!

01:29:18.590 --> 01:29:22.010
Hello, I know you all saw
me on the national news.

01:29:22.032 --> 01:29:26.146
I was wearing pink thong and being
sexually assaulted by a tranny blogger.

01:29:26.191 --> 01:29:29.973
So, so weird that we're
not talking about it, right?

01:29:30.107 --> 01:29:33.950
He's just dehydrated.  Low blood
sugar.  Could we get some nuts!

01:29:33.970 --> 01:29:38.939
No, Mom!  It's not time now.
It's honesty time now. Okay.

01:29:39.466 --> 01:29:43.954
Here it is.  So Rachel doesn't really
want to marry me.  She never did.

01:29:44.525 --> 01:29:48.455
She's confused because
yesterday I did this thing

01:29:48.511 --> 01:29:54.311
to the upper left quadrant of her
clitoris, which sounds she had an orgasm.

01:29:54.336 --> 01:29:57.428
She actually hasn't have
one, it's been like a year.

01:29:57.429 --> 01:30:02.147
There hasn't been any of that since
she falls asleep every time we have sex.

01:30:02.244 --> 01:30:06.364
Yeah, I know that sounds like crazy,
but I thought she had a bit of narcolepsy.

01:30:06.365 --> 01:30:08.194
Let me explain, okay.

01:30:08.625 --> 01:30:12.600
Rachel came to get me in Toronto and
I always thought that was really romantic,

01:30:12.633 --> 01:30:16.282
but then I'm kind of realizing
that actually she wasn't...

01:30:16.357 --> 01:30:21.299
she was feeling lonely and sort of
sad and insecure, and I get that.

01:30:21.326 --> 01:30:23.387
I mean she gets like that
sometimes and we talked.

01:30:23.388 --> 01:30:25.857
We talked that out.
I've always been there for her.

01:30:25.918 --> 01:30:27.635
But the problem is, is that,

01:30:27.736 --> 01:30:31.540
this isn't where you want
to start from for a marriage

01:30:31.575 --> 01:30:34.176
and I know that she
doesn't really want to.

01:30:35.559 --> 01:30:40.380
Rachel, I'm really sorry.
So, in conclusion ...

01:30:41.652 --> 01:30:44.857
I'm out of here.
Thank you.  Good night.

01:30:54.528 --> 01:30:58.519
Ahh it's so wild.
How funny a book club.

01:30:58.695 --> 01:31:02.814
Tell your grandparents
I can't wait to meet them.

01:31:05.053 --> 01:31:07.052
Goodbye.

01:31:07.527 --> 01:31:10.825
- Excuse me, excuse me.
- Dude. Well, you're back?

01:31:10.945 --> 01:31:14.634
- Yeah, I just drop off my stuff here.
- Wait!  What the hell?

01:31:14.754 --> 01:31:18.758
- I thought you were getting married?
- Yeah, but... changed plans.

01:31:18.878 --> 01:31:21.416
- And so where are you going right now?
- I'm going to the Strip Club.

01:31:22.017 --> 01:31:23.829
- You want to come?
- No, no I can't do that.

01:31:23.830 --> 01:31:26.029
- Please, come with me!
- No I can't do that. I can't be that guy.

01:31:26.064 --> 01:31:28.371
I can't go to places like that.
I can't go to a places with like...

01:31:28.405 --> 01:31:32.752
dancers and music like that and
a shot of vodka to ... your soul.

01:31:32.946 --> 01:31:35.892
- Can't be that guy?
- Fuck! So stupid...

01:31:36.012 --> 01:31:37.642
- Give me another second.
- Yeah, I just...

01:31:37.643 --> 01:31:39.595
Could you just give me 5 seconds, please?
Just want to ask you something.

01:31:39.596 --> 01:31:40.845
- Is that cool?
- Yeah, of course, yeah.

01:31:41.171 --> 01:31:43.701
You're in like... in a
relationship, right,

01:31:43.702 --> 01:31:47.128
and with somebody that you really wanna
be in that relationship with, right?

01:31:47.797 --> 01:31:52.396
And you want to give yourself
over to it... like completely, right?

01:31:52.921 --> 01:31:55.722
So... like how do you do that?

01:31:57.297 --> 01:32:03.130
How do you do that and
not like lose part of himself?

01:32:03.863 --> 01:32:06.432
- That's stupid?
- You are seriously cute.

01:32:06.553 --> 01:32:09.554
This is the sweetest thing... No!
Honestly that's the sweetest thing.

01:32:09.555 --> 01:32:10.374
Just shut up and go!

01:32:10.375 --> 01:32:12.531
Wait, I'll tell you the
answer to that question okay!

01:32:12.532 --> 01:32:13.532
What?

01:32:14.181 --> 01:32:16.215
The Strip Club is like calling

01:32:16.216 --> 01:32:17.671
- out to you tonight.
- No, I'm not going to go.

01:32:17.672 --> 01:32:20.995
"Dandak, Dandak
come to the Strip Club"

01:32:23.613 --> 01:32:26.019
- You're an ass. You're an ass to me.
- Let it come!

01:32:26.148 --> 01:32:27.644
- You're an ass.  So it's coming.
- Leave it come!

01:32:27.664 --> 01:32:32.707
It's coming! It's coming! You're such an
asshole! You know what? I wanna go change.

01:32:32.708 --> 01:32:37.332
Yeah!  Thank you, I could really use your
help.  Thank you.   It's gonna be good.

01:32:58.175 --> 01:33:00.174
<i>Julia!</i>

01:33:08.575 --> 01:33:12.360
You don't have to work here
anymore.  You got your loan now.

01:33:12.800 --> 01:33:16.850
I like working here and
I rejected your stupid loan.

01:33:16.866 --> 01:33:21.345
What? Why? Wait!  Can you
hold on?   I came back for you.

01:33:56.535 --> 01:33:58.534
Hey!

01:34:00.985 --> 01:34:03.384
- What happened to your book club?
- What?

01:34:03.443 --> 01:34:06.142
What are you doing here?
What happened to your book club?

01:34:10.577 --> 01:34:13.177
Can I talk to you?

01:34:14.260 --> 01:34:18.101
I'm sorry okay.  I'm sorry
that I left you in the shower!

01:34:18.102 --> 01:34:21.274
I just... I got terrified
and so I bailed.

01:34:22.019 --> 01:34:26.302
Fellow, you need to leave now,
because our little arrangement is over.

01:34:26.711 --> 01:34:29.136
Hey, just wait a second!
Please.

01:34:29.171 --> 01:34:32.071
- Guys don't touch, punk!  Douche-bag.
- No, no no!

01:34:32.261 --> 01:34:37.499
Hoy already threw him out once, Spike.
I don't know how he got in again.

01:34:41.053 --> 01:34:43.275
- Don't do this
- Get rid of him.

01:34:43.310 --> 01:34:45.152
I don't want to see
this douche-bag ever again.

01:34:45.153 --> 01:34:47.845
Why am I a douche-bag
Why is everyone calling...?  Ahh..

01:34:49.854 --> 01:34:51.953
Julia!

01:34:56.454 --> 01:34:59.686
I enjoy promiscuity sex.

01:35:00.470 --> 01:35:03.928
Reshma, I'm...
I'm a slut.

01:35:05.513 --> 01:35:09.679
I've done things that are like
illegal probably in most countries.

01:35:09.887 --> 01:35:18.897
I'm a dirty, dirty, dirty boy...

01:35:56.140 --> 01:35:59.739
Hey, it's only noon!
You got your coat already?

01:35:59.939 --> 01:36:02.940
I hope you got some guys on me.

01:36:03.390 --> 01:36:07.637
- No, I'm gonna eat breakfast in bed.
- Aren't you going to the buffet?

01:36:08.039 --> 01:36:11.303
It's Ham Tuesdays.
It's fucking sweet!

01:36:34.399 --> 01:36:38.400
APHRODISIAC

01:36:47.709 --> 01:36:50.590
Technically the grand opening
is still a couple of weeks away

01:36:50.600 --> 01:36:54.614
but I couldn't wait
anymore for you to see.

01:36:55.167 --> 01:36:56.753
You stole my idea?

01:36:56.754 --> 01:36:58.534
You said you won't
gonna do anymore of this.

01:36:58.599 --> 01:37:03.000
- So, finders keepers, right?
- And my stuff. You stole my stuff?

01:37:03.059 --> 01:37:06.397
No no, Skeet stole your
stuff, okay.  I stole it back.

01:37:06.517 --> 01:37:08.906
It's your stuff.  You can do
whatever you want with it.

01:37:08.907 --> 01:37:11.162
You know, I think it looks
pretty great in here.

01:37:13.976 --> 01:37:17.621
So, how have you been?

01:37:18.610 --> 01:37:22.309
I've been great.
And better than ever.

01:37:22.693 --> 01:37:25.959
I miss you.
I miss you and...

01:37:26.394 --> 01:37:28.254
I forced myself not to call,

01:37:28.255 --> 01:37:31.230
because I wanted to give
you a space and all that stuff

01:37:31.234 --> 01:37:33.198
but every day I picked up that phone,

01:37:33.199 --> 01:37:37.310
I did that thing where you dial the first
like six numbers and then the hover...

01:37:37.345 --> 01:37:39.436
This is all wrong.

01:37:39.526 --> 01:37:45.326
People need to be comfortable, they need
plush couches and it has to love seats.

01:37:46.019 --> 01:37:48.418
Couches here.

01:37:48.627 --> 01:37:50.815
And my tables, they need to be
refinished.  They're not finished.

01:37:50.816 --> 01:37:53.684
Good idea.
Yes, absolutely you're right.

01:37:57.311 --> 01:38:00.491
These colors are all wrong.  They
need to be warmer, earthy tones.

01:38:00.492 --> 01:38:02.801
Yeah, hey, guys.
Hold the work, okay.

01:38:02.836 --> 01:38:06.208
What's with the colour here?
What are you doing with this color?

01:38:07.302 --> 01:38:11.212
- What about the menu?
- Yeah, about that I...

01:38:11.663 --> 01:38:16.187
I should probably get on that cause
I haven't actually found a chef yet.

01:38:18.262 --> 01:38:23.737
It's... It's yours if you want it.

01:38:29.478 --> 01:38:33.728
Just let me ...
I have so much that I feel like I...

01:38:34.671 --> 01:38:38.293
You know, when you can ...

01:38:38.518 --> 01:38:41.191
You have a... feeling inside you ...

01:38:41.354 --> 01:38:44.209
You have this like... feeling...

01:38:53.588 --> 01:38:55.543
You  really really need
to work on your speech.

01:38:55.544 --> 01:38:57.044
Yeah, I know ...
You see what I meant?

01:38:57.192 --> 01:38:59.892
Thanks.

01:39:00.864 --> 01:39:04.628
<i>- Are you nervous?
- No.  Why would I be nervous?</i>

01:39:05.114 --> 01:39:08.682
<i>Well, you do have a history of putting
women to sleep when you fuck them, so...</i>

01:39:08.730 --> 01:39:10.455
<i>I'm just gonna go
ahead and say it like that, </i>

01:39:10.456 --> 01:39:12.695
<i>right, while I'm  lying
here naked with you.</i>

01:39:13.797 --> 01:39:16.907
<i>Thank you for bringing that up.</i>

01:39:18.048 --> 01:39:21.452
<i>When you're ready, you
can enter at your leisure.</i>

01:39:21.472 --> 01:39:24.781
<i>I'm ready! I'm ready.
Can you help me?</i>

01:39:26.648 --> 01:39:29.847
<i>Almost there. Is that... is that it?
- Yeah.</i>

01:39:38.049 --> 01:39:41.848
<i>- How do you feel?
- Yeah, it feels very good.</i>

01:39:44.065 --> 01:39:46.637
<i>Wait wait wait! Stop stop stop!
What are you doing?</i>

01:39:46.638 --> 01:39:48.201
<i>Nothing! What do you mean?</i>

01:39:48.691 --> 01:39:52.324
<i>You ...!
After ten seconds!</i>

01:39:52.649 --> 01:39:56.863
<i>- Isn't that's a compliment?
- How did Rachel trying to fall asleep?</i>

01:39:56.956 --> 01:40:00.508
<i>I don't know.
- How did you tackle this
issue at the Rub & Tug?</i>

01:40:00.732 --> 01:40:03.076
<i>Come on. I really rather
not go there right now.</i>

01:40:03.077 --> 01:40:05.290
<i>I'm good, I'm good.
I'm cool, I'm good.</i>

01:40:07.357 --> 01:40:11.438
<i>- I'm calm now.
- Ok, let's move together.</i>

01:40:11.541 --> 01:40:15.640
<i>- Can you change the angle?
- Oh! That feels good!</i>

01:40:15.760 --> 01:40:18.204
<i>- Yeah?
- Yeah!</i>

01:40:18.690 --> 01:40:21.344
<i>That does it! Yeah, okay.
- Oop, sorry.</i>

01:40:22.050 --> 01:40:24.264
<i>Oh yeah!</i>

01:40:26.325 --> 01:40:28.798
<i>- What... what?
- Right, I stopping...</i>

01:40:28.817 --> 01:40:32.187
<i>- I'm breathing, I'm breathing!
- No, no, no!  Keep going.</i>

01:40:34.400 --> 01:40:36.763
<i>I got a leg cramp!</i>

01:40:36.783 --> 01:40:41.192
<i>Well, squeeze your toes, squeeze
your toes together, then relax...</i>

01:40:43.409 --> 01:40:46.671
<i>Oh, that's better.</i>

01:40:51.132 --> 01:40:52.451
<i>- Oh, where did it go?
- Yeah.</i>

01:40:52.652 --> 01:40:55.037
<i>- Is that going to come out. Oh no no no.
- Okay.</i>

01:40:55.651 --> 01:40:58.881
<i>- Sorry, it's slippery.
- This thing happens.</i>

01:40:59.102 --> 01:41:03.780
<i>- Seems to be getting there! Oh, yeah!
- Oh, yeah!</i>

01:41:03.815 --> 01:41:08.580
<i>I'm in zones. I'm in zones.
I can do this forever and ever.</i>

01:41:10.985 --> 01:41:15.150
<i>- Are you near?
- No! No! No!</i>

01:41:15.327 --> 01:41:19.132
<i>- Love it. Don't you think?
- Okay!</i>

01:41:24.402 --> 01:41:26.603
<i>You are pretty!</i>
