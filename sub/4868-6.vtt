06:32.300 --> 06:33.467
- So I'm gonna pencil that in
as a maybe.

06:33.500 --> 06:34.467
- That's gonna be a no.
- I wouldn't.

06:34.500 --> 06:35.734
- Maybe.
- That is a hard maybe.

06:35.734 --> 06:37.533
- It's the softest no
you'll ever feel.

06:37.567 --> 06:38.734
both: Hmm.
- Okay.

06:38.734 --> 06:41.200
- So you gals gonna get your
pom-poms and cheer us on

06:41.200 --> 06:42.600
at the Kimmewah Kup tomorrow?
- [laughs]

06:42.600 --> 06:44.333
We're actually gonna be
cheering beside you

06:44.333 --> 06:46.700
for ourselves as we beat
your asses.

06:46.734 --> 06:48.333
(both)
Hmm.

06:48.367 --> 06:50.066
- We probably won't notice
'cause we're gonna be too busy--

06:50.100 --> 06:51.333
both: Twinning!

06:51.333 --> 06:54.166
- Oh, because you always--
both: Cheat!

06:54.200 --> 06:55.367
- Ow.
- Hmm.

06:55.367 --> 06:56.767
- And you've met
your match this year.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.367
- Yeah.
- Because the Dream Team

06:58.367 --> 06:59.767
has been reunited.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.333
- Where is that?
- And I don't know

07:01.367 --> 07:03.033
if you can see, but I've
been working these calves out.

07:03.066 --> 07:04.767
Right? Can you see the
definition through the jeans?

07:05.000 --> 07:06.166
- Can't see through the jeans.
- Nope.

07:06.200 --> 07:07.567
- Do you wanna do this?
- This is calf power.

07:07.600 --> 07:09.367
- Do you wanna go with this?
- Feel it, feel it.

07:09.367 --> 07:11.633
- Do you wanna get involved
in this, guys?

07:11.633 --> 07:13.433
Okay, I don't wanna
get aggressive,

07:13.467 --> 07:15.500
but hold on one second.
So sorry. Keep looking at me.

07:15.533 --> 07:17.066
- What's happening?
Did you get a cramp?

07:17.100 --> 07:18.233
- It'd Dan.
Oh, I gotta take it.

07:18.266 --> 07:20.100
- Right now? In the middle of--
We're smoking them.

07:20.133 --> 07:21.600
- I'll be right back, okay.

07:21.633 --> 07:24.033
Sorry, guys, it's my boyfriend,
and he's a rabbi, so...

07:24.066 --> 07:25.100
- Ooh.
- Seriously?

07:25.133 --> 07:26.166
- Hey, Dan.
- Uh-oh.

07:26.200 --> 07:27.633
A little trouble
in paradisio?

07:27.667 --> 07:29.233
- Don't worry about us.
We're right as rain.

07:29.266 --> 07:30.567
- You're gonna need to be
as right as rain,

07:30.600 --> 07:32.500
'cause if you wanna beat us
you gotta be--

07:32.500 --> 07:34.367
both: In sync.

07:37.567 --> 07:38.734
Can't touch this.

07:38.767 --> 07:40.266
- What was that?

07:40.266 --> 07:42.467
That was like the worst
choreography I've ever seen.

07:42.500 --> 07:44.767
Do you even know
how to body roll?

07:45.000 --> 07:47.633
- Okay.
There you go.

07:47.667 --> 07:49.000
- Ugh.
- Can you--oh, my God.

07:49.033 --> 07:50.266
What is going on with you?

07:50.300 --> 07:52.066
- I don't know, maybe
I'm having trust issues,

07:52.100 --> 07:54.533
'cause you left me hanging
with the Custerman wieners.

07:54.567 --> 07:56.133
- God, I said I was sorry,
all right?

07:56.133 --> 07:57.667
And I promise,
the rest of the night

07:57.667 --> 08:00.400
is about you, me, and these
13-year-olds on YouTube

08:00.400 --> 08:02.133
teaching us how to do
a smoky eye.

08:02.166 --> 08:03.600
God bless their
absentee mothers.

08:03.633 --> 08:06.133
All right, now what is
the plan for tomorrow?

08:06.166 --> 08:07.500
- So we're gonna
get up early.

08:07.533 --> 08:09.100
We're gonna prep the boat.

08:09.133 --> 08:10.467
- Done and done.

08:10.500 --> 08:12.233
- And then we're gonna brush
and braid each other's hair,

08:12.266 --> 08:14.400
and then we'll relax by hitting
the old jiggy puzz.

08:14.400 --> 08:15.667
- Oh, what if I were
to braid your hair

08:15.700 --> 08:18.133
while you were doing
your jigsaw puzzle?

08:18.166 --> 08:19.500
- Now you're talking jazz.

08:19.533 --> 08:21.033
- Yeah!

08:21.033 --> 08:22.033
[laughter]

08:22.033 --> 08:23.567
[phone rings]

08:23.567 --> 08:24.700
Oh, it's Dan.
That's weird.

08:24.700 --> 08:26.166
- Oh, is it weird?

08:26.200 --> 08:27.433
You're not gonna
get it though.

08:27.467 --> 08:29.367
- Oh, no, I'm just gonna
let it go to voicemail, so...

08:29.400 --> 08:31.033
- All right.
- There we go.

08:31.066 --> 08:33.033
- Oh, my God,
what if we were to do

08:33.033 --> 08:35.100
a dramatic smoky eye
for the race,

08:35.133 --> 08:36.567
like as part
of our uniform?

08:36.600 --> 08:39.033
- My God, that's the fiercest
thing you've ever said to me.

08:39.066 --> 08:40.567
- Ooh, girl!

08:40.600 --> 08:41.633
You're welcome.

08:41.667 --> 08:44.166
[phone rings]
God. Ugh.

08:44.200 --> 08:46.000
I'm sorry, I just hope
it's not an emergency.

08:46.033 --> 08:47.533
- What kind of emergency
could it be,

08:47.567 --> 08:49.567
like a rabbinical
sex emergency?

08:49.567 --> 08:51.266
- No, I just--I'm just gonna
take it real quick.

08:51.300 --> 08:52.266
- Really?
- Yep.

08:52.300 --> 08:53.500
Hey, Dan.
- Okay.

08:53.533 --> 08:55.300
- Hey, is everything okay?

08:55.300 --> 08:57.233
Oh, I wish you were here too.

08:57.266 --> 08:58.433
- "Wish you were here."

08:58.433 --> 09:01.333
- Wait a second.
No, you didn't!

09:01.367 --> 09:03.734
- I'm here.
- Ahhhh!

09:03.734 --> 09:06.033
- Oh, my God,
Maggie, he's here!

09:06.066 --> 09:08.734
What a surprise!
- [chuckles]

09:13.100 --> 09:13.233
.

09:13.333 --> 09:13.533
- So, I mean,

09:13.533 --> 09:14.000
- So, I mean,
that was Red Rocks.

09:14.767 --> 09:16.333
And Dave Matthews
closed off the set

09:16.333 --> 09:19.066
with this incredible version
of "Watchtower."

09:19.100 --> 09:20.567
- Oh.
- It was on the mix that I--

09:20.600 --> 09:22.734
- Yes. Oh, my God,
it was so good.

09:22.734 --> 09:23.734
Remember, Maggie?

09:23.734 --> 09:26.333
- Oh, yeah, God,
I am just so glad

09:26.333 --> 09:27.600
that somebody recorded it.

09:27.600 --> 09:28.734
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

09:28.767 --> 09:31.467
- So, Dan, are you staying
the whole weekend

09:31.467 --> 09:32.600
or are you driving back?

09:32.633 --> 09:34.166
- Oh, no, he's gonna stay
the weekend, right?

09:34.200 --> 09:35.200
- I don't know.
- Yes!

09:35.233 --> 09:36.567
I don't want
to barge in on you guys.

09:36.600 --> 09:39.400
I just--Maggie kept saying
that she wishes I was here.

09:39.433 --> 09:41.567
- Oh, I did.

09:41.600 --> 09:43.633
- I did say--Did I say that?
- Yeah.

09:43.667 --> 09:45.367
- But I don't wanna mess
with your guys' flow.

09:45.400 --> 09:47.166
I will do
whatever you guys do.

09:47.200 --> 09:49.100
- Well, right now
we're doing smoky eyes.

09:49.100 --> 09:51.100
- I don't think
he wants that.

09:51.133 --> 09:52.734
- Well, he said he wants to do
whatever we're doing,

09:52.767 --> 09:54.033
and that's what we're doing,
so...

09:54.066 --> 09:55.066
- Actually,
I have been told

09:55.100 --> 09:56.200
that I'd make
an attractive woman.

09:56.233 --> 09:57.233
- Okay.
- Oh, great!

09:57.266 --> 09:59.066
So first step is mascara.

09:59.100 --> 10:00.600
- Okay, please don't put
mascara on my boyfriend.

10:00.633 --> 10:01.600
- No, I don't mind.

10:01.633 --> 10:03.100
- He said he
wanted to do it, so...

10:03.133 --> 10:04.367
- He's just being polite,
so--

10:04.400 --> 10:06.233
- He does wanna do it.
- No, he doesn't.

10:06.233 --> 10:09.100
- He wants to. I'm gonna put
mascara on your boyfriend!

10:09.100 --> 10:11.233
- Oh.

10:11.233 --> 10:13.367
- Um, I'm sorry.

10:13.400 --> 10:14.367
Uh...

10:14.400 --> 10:15.500
[laughter]

10:15.500 --> 10:18.433
That was obviously a joke.

10:18.467 --> 10:20.734
I'm not gonna put mascara
on your boyfriend.

10:20.767 --> 10:22.266
- Yeah, okay.

10:22.266 --> 10:24.400
Well, you know what, actually,
we should all just hit the hay,

10:24.400 --> 10:26.533
'cause, you know, I wanna
get up with the sun

10:26.533 --> 10:28.233
as I love to do, you know?

10:28.266 --> 10:30.400
- No, you don't.
[laughs]

10:30.433 --> 10:31.467
What?

10:31.500 --> 10:32.734
Oh, my God,
I get up early all the time.

10:32.767 --> 10:34.767
I'm always doing
my sun salutations.

10:35.000 --> 10:36.400
- I'm trying to remember
when the last time

10:36.433 --> 10:38.600
you got up early was,
and I think it was when

10:38.633 --> 10:40.467
that sick bat
flew into your window.

10:40.500 --> 10:42.367
- Oh, no.
Were you hurt?

10:42.400 --> 10:44.133
- No, I was
a little scared.

10:44.166 --> 10:46.133
- Scared? It was--
The bat was scared.

10:46.166 --> 10:48.667
- I wish I was there.
I woulda gotten rid of that bat.

10:48.667 --> 10:50.333
- You know what, fine,
you guys,

10:50.367 --> 10:53.133
why don't you just go talk
about that sick bat in your bed?

10:53.166 --> 10:54.266
- Are you sure?

10:54.300 --> 10:56.000
- Yeah, we'll just get up
fresh and early

10:56.033 --> 10:57.400
for boat prep
in the morning, right?

10:57.400 --> 10:58.467
- Absolutely.
- All right.

10:58.500 --> 10:59.500
- Okay.
- Pancakes.

10:59.533 --> 11:01.100
- Oh, pancakes!
That'd be great.

11:01.133 --> 11:02.667
- Good night!
- Night, guys.

11:02.667 --> 11:04.166
- Don't!

11:07.700 --> 11:10.367
- All right, um...

11:10.400 --> 11:13.667
guess I'll just dive into
"Fried Greens-To-The-T"

11:13.700 --> 11:17.233
and see what old
Idgie Threadgoode is up to.

You mad at that boat?

11:37.400 --> 11:38.633
- Yeah, why do you hate
that boat?

11:38.667 --> 11:41.300
- I'm just preparing it
for the race tomorrow, friends.

11:41.300 --> 11:43.266
- Well, you might want to check
the underside, 'cause, uh--

11:43.300 --> 11:45.266
- There's a whole lot
of starboard oxidation.

11:45.300 --> 11:47.700
- And a ton of dorsal rot.
- Goo!

11:47.734 --> 11:48.700
- You know what,
why don't you guys

11:48.734 --> 11:50.300
work on your own boat?

11:50.333 --> 11:52.333

11:55.700 --> 11:57.533
Not at liberty
to show you those right now.

11:57.567 --> 11:59.400
- Yeah, that's

12:00.734 --> 12:02.333
we're gonna be hanging out
a little bit later,

12:02.333 --> 12:03.600
taking a nice long soak
in the cooze.

12:03.600 --> 12:04.667
You might want to stop by.

12:04.700 --> 12:06.200
We'll throw in some 'ades.

Hey, morning, sailor!

12:18.100 --> 12:19.066
- Hey.

12:19.100 --> 12:20.333
- I'm so sorry
we overslept.

12:20.333 --> 12:21.600
- Yeah, what happened?

12:21.633 --> 12:23.467
- Oh, we just were, uh--
we were tired.

12:23.467 --> 12:24.600
- Yeah.
- [chuckles] So...

12:24.600 --> 12:26.333
Hey, come on,
grab your hiking boots,

12:26.333 --> 12:28.233
'cause I promised Dan
we'd take him on a hike.

12:28.266 --> 12:29.500
- What?

12:29.500 --> 12:31.100
- Yeah.
- You hate hiking.

12:31.133 --> 12:32.600
- I love to hike.
- Since when?

12:32.633 --> 12:34.633
- What are you talking about?
I hiked all the time in China.

12:34.633 --> 12:37.100
Remember that Great Wall
of China? I've hiked that.

12:37.133 --> 12:38.367
- You didn't though.

12:38.400 --> 12:39.633
- Well, listen, we don't have
to hike right now.

12:39.633 --> 12:41.033
We can go anytime today.

12:41.066 --> 12:42.333
- Yeah, we have a lot
of work to do on the boat,

12:42.367 --> 12:44.300
'cause there's, like,
starboard and oxidation

12:44.333 --> 12:45.500
with the dorsals.

12:45.533 --> 12:46.700
- Why don't we just
get this baby in the water,

12:46.734 --> 12:47.700
see if it floats?

12:47.734 --> 12:49.233
- Fine.
- Fine?

12:49.233 --> 12:51.233
- Fine.
both; Fine!

12:51.266 --> 12:53.033
- See?
Everything's fine.

12:53.066 --> 12:55.633
- All right, so you wanna take
these calves for a practice lap?

12:55.667 --> 12:57.767

Oh, wait, you know what,
there's only two seats.

12:59.500 --> 13:01.166

Dan, you get in.

13:01.200 --> 13:02.500
- Oh, no.
- No, no, no, I insist.

13:02.533 --> 13:04.300
- No, no, no, no.
- I insist, get on in there.

13:04.333 --> 13:05.500
Come on now.
- Really?

13:05.533 --> 13:07.066
- Just get in.
You're gonna love it.

13:07.100 --> 13:09.600
- Just--Okay.
Hey, hey.

13:09.633 --> 13:11.233
- Okay.

- Nobody wants this.
- What?

with your dumb boyfriend.

- [scoffs]
- I see.

20:28.066 --> 20:29.333
So they lied.

20:29.333 --> 20:31.200
- Those dirty rats,
they cheated.

20:31.233 --> 20:32.734
- All right, there's only
one thing to do.

20:32.734 --> 20:34.700
- Wait, Mags,
the finish line is that way.

20:34.734 --> 20:36.433
- Yeah, I'm not aiming
for the finish line.

20:36.467 --> 20:37.734
- Oh, God.

20:37.767 --> 20:39.133
I know it isn't right,

20:39.166 --> 20:41.166
but I can't stop pumping
these calves!

20:41.200 --> 20:42.200
- Keep pumping!

20:42.200 --> 20:44.066
- What are you doing?
No!

20:44.066 --> 20:47.000
[both imitating loon]

20:47.033 --> 20:49.066
- They're coming
straight for us!

20:49.100 --> 20:50.266
- Ram 'em!

20:53.100 --> 20:55.600
both: Kimmewah!
