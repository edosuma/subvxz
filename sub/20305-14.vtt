WEBVTT

00:01.001 --> 00:02.293
There's somebody here to see you.

00:02.377 --> 00:04.629
NARRATOR:
<i>Previously on</i> Hill Street Blues...

00:04.713 --> 00:06.589
-Hey, Sandy.
-Hi.

00:06.673 --> 00:08.174
-How you doing?
-Fine.

00:08.675 --> 00:11.386
Item eight, passing the sergeant's exam,

00:11.469 --> 00:14.806
Officers Lucille Bates and Joseph Coffey.

00:14.889 --> 00:17.142
(cheering)

00:18.685 --> 00:21.187
-(tires squeal)
-(gunshot)

00:22.647 --> 00:24.149
When's the sergeant coming back?

00:24.232 --> 00:26.776
He comes home from the hospital today.
Says he'll be in tomorrow morning.

00:26.860 --> 00:29.029
Thought you might need
some taking care of.

00:29.362 --> 00:30.613
Want to take my pulse?

00:35.869 --> 00:38.872
(chattering)

00:38.955 --> 00:40.874
Item ten, jailbreak.

00:41.541 --> 00:42.500
Not literally, guys.

00:42.584 --> 00:46.796
For those of you who don't watch TV,
listen to the radio or talk to anybody,

00:46.880 --> 00:49.883
Judge Cruz last night
ordered 247 prisoners

00:49.966 --> 00:51.885
awaiting trial released OR

00:51.968 --> 00:53.970
-from the Michigan Avenue complex...
-(cheering)

00:54.054 --> 00:57.182
...due to severe overcrowding
and inhumane conditions.

00:57.265 --> 01:00.185
Right, put those inhumane conditions
back on the street where they belong.

01:01.352 --> 01:03.772
HENRY: Okay, whether we agree or disagree,

01:03.855 --> 01:06.441
these alleged perpetrators
are back out there

01:06.524 --> 01:08.276
so we're probably gonna be busy.

01:08.359 --> 01:12.363
Additionally, item 11,
until Division Vice is reconstituted,

01:12.447 --> 01:16.326
we're assigned ongoing
prostitution enforcement for the Hill.

01:16.409 --> 01:18.995
Midtown, Washington and Jefferson Heights.

01:19.079 --> 01:20.580
(murmuring)

01:20.663 --> 01:23.458
-Operation Pussy Cat...
-MAN: Say what?

01:23.541 --> 01:25.710
-...commences today...
-(meowing)

01:25.794 --> 01:28.463
...at 0800 hours, just in time

01:28.546 --> 01:31.758
to catch the brisk breakfast hour trade.

01:31.841 --> 01:35.136
-RENKO: You're so mean, Lucy!
-(laughter)

01:35.220 --> 01:37.263
Your trained eyes may detect among us

01:37.347 --> 01:39.891
some of the personnel assigned
to said operation.

01:39.974 --> 01:43.144
-(chattering)
-Additionally, Hill, Renko, Perez,

01:43.228 --> 01:45.188
and Kolzicki will work backup.

01:45.855 --> 01:50.652
Peyser and Martin will be working
plain clothes out of ND sedans.

01:52.195 --> 01:56.199
Item 12, our truck hijacking problems
is becoming more blatant.

01:56.282 --> 01:57.575
Two more yesterday.

01:57.659 --> 01:59.869
This seems to be something
of a criminal fad.

02:00.203 --> 02:02.413
The toll is up to six drivers
beaten and knifed,

02:02.497 --> 02:05.083
plus a couple hundred grand
in merchandise boosted.

02:06.042 --> 02:08.378
Maybe catching some guys
would make this less fashionable.

02:08.461 --> 02:11.297
-What do you say?
-(murmuring)

02:11.381 --> 02:12.841
Last item, welcomes.

02:13.550 --> 02:16.511
-Welcome back, Mike Perez.
-(cheering)

02:16.594 --> 02:19.139
-Hey, yeah.
-Miguelito!

02:19.222 --> 02:22.600
Welcome transfer, Clara Pilsky
from South Ferry.

02:22.684 --> 02:24.602
-(cheering)
-(whistling)

02:24.686 --> 02:26.646
Hello, hello.

02:27.647 --> 02:30.733
Okay, that's it, people, thank you.
Have a good shift.

02:31.025 --> 02:34.571
Uh, could you keep your seats
a minute, please?

02:34.654 --> 02:35.905
Can I have your attention?

02:42.412 --> 02:43.621
Uh...

02:44.789 --> 02:46.749
Phil Esterhaus passed away this morning.

02:46.833 --> 02:49.002
(murmuring)

02:49.085 --> 02:50.128
Suffered a heart attack.

02:50.211 --> 02:53.256
That's the only detail
I have at this time.

02:55.842 --> 02:58.052
Information as it comes in...

02:59.179 --> 03:00.638
about services...

03:02.015 --> 03:03.474
will be on the duty board.

03:05.435 --> 03:07.896
Our friend was 55 years old.

03:12.942 --> 03:14.527
If people want to take a moment.

03:18.281 --> 03:20.617
(silence)

03:52.732 --> 03:54.692
I don't have too many words, people.

04:00.907 --> 04:03.243
This is going to be a difficult day.

04:06.329 --> 04:08.748
I know the caution Phil would urge on you.

04:11.251 --> 04:12.502
Be careful out there.

04:19.968 --> 04:21.302
Son of a bitch.

04:23.596 --> 04:26.349
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch. We have a 9-11.</i>

04:26.432 --> 04:28.142
<i>Armed robbery in progress.</i>

04:28.226 --> 04:32.188
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

04:32.272 --> 04:33.982
(sirens wailing)

04:39.362 --> 04:43.157
(theme music playing)

05:58.608 --> 06:01.235
You know, I never met the sarge.
What was he like?

06:01.736 --> 06:02.862
-Sarge?
-Yeah.

06:03.029 --> 06:04.572
Was a real piece of work.

06:05.365 --> 06:06.366
He was...

06:07.742 --> 06:09.035
He was a rock.

06:11.037 --> 06:16.417
When everything was going wrong, I mean,
you'd see this man sitting there.

06:18.795 --> 06:20.922
Took the edge off.
You know what I'm saying?

06:21.547 --> 06:22.507
Yeah.

06:24.050 --> 06:27.178
I didn't think he'd ever been sick
for a day in his life.

06:30.139 --> 06:32.141
-I got a Lincoln. Okay.
-Yeah.

06:34.018 --> 06:36.187
Hi, there. Hi. Hi.

06:36.854 --> 06:38.689
Yo, daddy.

06:40.358 --> 06:41.192
What's happening?

06:43.111 --> 06:45.321
-Hi.
-Hi.

06:45.405 --> 06:47.573
-Recognize me?
-Uh-uh.

06:49.033 --> 06:51.035
That's why I always carry this card.

06:52.787 --> 06:56.541
-I never leave home without it.
-So what are we talking about, huh?

06:58.376 --> 07:00.336
We're talking about you and me
going someplace

07:00.420 --> 07:01.879
and maybe getting naked somehow.

07:01.963 --> 07:04.882
Yeah, I don't look real impressed,
do I, sport?

07:15.643 --> 07:17.437
-You'll be impressed.
-Yeah?

07:17.770 --> 07:20.940
Now we go someplace
and you get this, blondie.

07:22.775 --> 07:25.486
Oh, so you're Virginia Kimble, huh?

07:27.071 --> 07:31.659
You act real fast and you might
get yourself a nice ride, sugar.

07:32.285 --> 07:33.536
-Right.
-Now where we going?

07:34.162 --> 07:36.914
How about my office, hmm? Come on.

07:40.918 --> 07:43.212
Hey, blondie, I said where we going?

07:44.046 --> 07:44.881
Well...

07:46.299 --> 07:48.551
I just figured that we'd go to jail, huh?

07:48.634 --> 07:50.511
Backup Sally off 34th and Dekker.

07:50.595 --> 07:52.013
(grunting)

07:52.096 --> 07:53.014
Clara!

07:54.140 --> 07:58.269
-Peyser, where are you?
-(siren blaring)

07:58.352 --> 08:00.229
Clara, go.

08:09.614 --> 08:11.949
(groaning)

08:13.993 --> 08:16.120
(panting)

08:16.996 --> 08:18.039
Everybody okay?

08:18.372 --> 08:20.917
-Clara?
-Just catching my breath.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.084
Okay.

08:22.543 --> 08:24.462
-Nice, Archie.
-Thanks, same to you.

08:24.545 --> 08:26.881
-Let's get a dump truck for this guy.
-Right.

08:28.841 --> 08:30.927
(siren wailing)

08:35.097 --> 08:37.600
No signs of forced entry.
No signs of struggle.

08:37.683 --> 08:40.603
-Robbery?
-Register's rifled. Guy took her purse.

08:41.854 --> 08:44.440
When I came in,
he must have already been inside.

08:44.524 --> 08:47.944
I didn't hear anybody.
I just turned around and he was there.

08:48.861 --> 08:52.740
Uh... He had a knife.
Said he was gonna kill me.

08:54.158 --> 08:56.827
He made me get undressed
and lie on the floor.

08:58.996 --> 08:59.997
Uh...

09:01.415 --> 09:04.794
He ran the knife over me.
Put it in my mouth.

09:07.171 --> 09:10.007
His eyes were crazy.
He was really dark and crazy.

09:10.591 --> 09:11.968
I was so frightened.

09:14.262 --> 09:16.138
-Told me to do things.
-Okay.

09:17.014 --> 09:19.392
Do you think you can give me
a description, Sandy?

09:19.475 --> 09:20.726
(shudders) Yeah.

09:21.519 --> 09:23.104
He was Latin.

09:23.813 --> 09:25.856
Maybe 5'8", 5'9".

09:25.940 --> 09:28.943
Um, dark pants, black.

09:29.026 --> 09:32.780
And one of those grey hooded sweatshirts.

09:34.073 --> 09:35.825
-Where is she?
-Inside.

09:36.200 --> 09:38.578
-(sighs) It was her?
-Yeah.

09:39.787 --> 09:42.373
-Is she hurt?
-No, I don't think so.

09:45.001 --> 09:47.712
Hey. Hey, look, Joe.
Maybe you don't want to go in there, man.

09:48.212 --> 09:50.715
-What, are you telling me I can't?
-No.

09:57.638 --> 09:59.640
-Manager.
-Yo, J.D.

10:00.057 --> 10:01.058
Manager's in here.

10:06.272 --> 10:07.106
Sandy.

10:08.190 --> 10:12.903
Joe. Joe, I'm so glad you're here.
(sobbing)

10:14.697 --> 10:17.158
It's all right. It's all right.

10:24.040 --> 10:26.500
-You Harlan?
-Yeah.

10:26.584 --> 10:29.086
Can you give us the names of any employees
that had keys to this building?

10:29.170 --> 10:31.130
-No, I can't.
-WASHINGTON: Why is that?

10:31.756 --> 10:34.383
They trade shifts.
They give the keys to each other.

10:34.467 --> 10:36.093
I tell them not to, but they do it anyway.

10:36.177 --> 10:37.470
What about a list of everybody
who worked here

10:37.553 --> 10:38.888
in the last couple of years?

10:38.971 --> 10:43.601
Yeah, sure, well I'll just take some
morning off and type it up for you.

10:43.893 --> 10:44.727
Can I ask you a question?

10:44.810 --> 10:47.146
How come the law don't apply to cops
like everybody else?

10:47.229 --> 10:48.648
-How's that?
-Come on.

10:48.731 --> 10:51.275
You guys come in here, man,
it's like Attila the Hun.

10:51.359 --> 10:53.569
You close down the joint, no trade.

10:53.653 --> 10:55.738
Plus, you've been eating me
out of house and home out there,

10:55.821 --> 10:58.074
and I ain't seen dime one
on that counter, all right?

10:58.157 --> 10:59.659
Hey, look, okay,
we'll pay you for the donuts.

10:59.742 --> 11:02.411
-You just give us the list.
-What list?

11:02.495 --> 11:04.038
Now, you listen up, sucker.

11:04.121 --> 11:06.207
You have picked the wrong day,
you understand?

11:06.290 --> 11:08.542
Now, we got a rape
and you're worried about donuts.

11:08.626 --> 11:11.170
But for the time being,
we are talking about rape.

11:11.253 --> 11:13.381
Now we want to know every guy
who's worked in here,

11:13.464 --> 11:15.132
every guy who's been busted in here,

11:15.216 --> 11:16.884
and every guy you fired
for the last couple of years.

11:16.967 --> 11:18.511
You got that, sucker?

11:27.269 --> 11:31.649
I'll give you my list of W4s.
You can figure it out for yourself.

11:35.361 --> 11:36.946
I told you, that was my mama's TV, man.

11:37.029 --> 11:39.115
-We were getting it repaired.
-Tell it to the judge, boy.

11:39.198 --> 11:42.451
Leo, I got a couple of enterprising
young TV thieves here for you.

11:42.535 --> 11:44.578
Store owner is on his way down to ID them.

11:44.662 --> 11:46.622
-Anybody call the PD?
-Hey, we don't need no PD, man.

11:46.706 --> 11:48.165
Just get Jesus Martinez down here, man.

11:48.249 --> 11:50.292
Walk over here, man. Walk over here.

11:50.376 --> 11:53.713
Hello, Leo. To see Captain Furillo.

11:56.006 --> 11:57.216
Go on, Mrs. Gardner.

12:11.939 --> 12:13.983
Grace, I'm so sorry.

12:34.837 --> 12:39.383
Phil asked me if anything happened
to deliver this to you.

12:41.135 --> 12:43.846
I believe he wanted you to be executor.

12:48.809 --> 12:50.478
I was with him, Frank.

12:51.228 --> 12:52.980
I saw him last week
and he seemed on the mend.

12:53.063 --> 12:54.523
He said he was on the mend.

12:54.607 --> 12:57.485
Over the weekend they did an angiogram.

12:58.819 --> 13:00.946
They told him his heart had weakened.

13:01.906 --> 13:04.116
Something about a stenosis.

13:05.367 --> 13:07.745
He didn't want anyone to know.

13:08.537 --> 13:11.248
-How are you, Grace?
-I'm all right.

13:12.374 --> 13:13.375
I'm just--

13:16.879 --> 13:20.591
The doctor said no this, no that.

13:21.175 --> 13:22.468
No sex.

13:25.387 --> 13:26.388
(chuckles)

13:27.890 --> 13:29.934
I don't know why I'm telling you all this.

13:32.978 --> 13:34.980
Maybe it's because I'm in
a police station,

13:35.064 --> 13:38.150
and I've come in to confess.

13:39.443 --> 13:45.407
This morning, early, Phil and I
were making love when he died.

13:46.700 --> 13:49.620
His great, brave heart...

13:51.038 --> 13:53.499
simply exploded.

13:55.209 --> 13:58.921
Well, Grace, you can't blame yourself.

14:00.631 --> 14:02.258
He was a beautiful,

14:03.008 --> 14:04.218
simple,

14:05.553 --> 14:07.137
honorable man.

14:10.140 --> 14:12.935
And I wanted to grow old with him.

14:18.983 --> 14:23.112
Frank, would it be too much
of an imposition

14:23.195 --> 14:27.283
to ask you to hold me for a few seconds?

14:35.916 --> 14:37.626
(sighs)

14:40.796 --> 14:43.966
Just a few hours ago, I was under him.

14:45.217 --> 14:47.344
And we felt each other's breath.

14:48.095 --> 14:49.930
Each other's life.

14:55.936 --> 14:57.771
I miss him so.

15:03.152 --> 15:06.363
(crying)

15:20.419 --> 15:21.420
Look at this.

15:22.171 --> 15:26.467
-Brand-new nylons shot to hell.
-Nice stems, mama.

15:30.512 --> 15:33.015
-In your face, punk.
-Oh, I wish.

15:34.016 --> 15:36.018
Act it cool, bro.
We're gonna clear this up.

15:38.228 --> 15:42.608
Little hubcap popper waltzes through here
like Yasser Arafat.

15:45.694 --> 15:47.279
Top of the morning, Frankie.

15:48.530 --> 15:49.698
Inside.

15:54.244 --> 15:55.371
Let's make it fast, Jesus.

15:55.746 --> 15:58.082
About those two misguided youths
you got here.

15:58.165 --> 16:00.292
Two youths with six priors between them.

16:00.376 --> 16:02.795
They're looking at larceny,
possession of stolen property, resisting.

16:02.878 --> 16:04.964
Case is airtight, Jesus.

16:05.047 --> 16:07.800
Okay, so you figure resisting
is an add-on, huh?

16:07.883 --> 16:10.052
We're talking about two-bit misdemeanors.

16:10.135 --> 16:12.262
Hardly worth your time to do the typing.

16:12.346 --> 16:14.723
-Maybe we could do some business here.
-Let's hear it.

16:15.307 --> 16:17.935
I tell you coming in what I'm looking for,

16:18.352 --> 16:20.354
you get this, my guys walk.

16:20.437 --> 16:21.772
If it stands up.

16:22.356 --> 16:23.524
If it stands up?

16:23.607 --> 16:26.735
Not only will it stand,
it's gonna walk, it's gonna jog.

16:26.819 --> 16:29.697
-Yo, Frankie, who you dealing with here?
-What do you have?

16:30.114 --> 16:33.659
Someone's going around the neighborhood
knocking down delivery trucks.

16:33.742 --> 16:34.785
You heard about that?

16:35.536 --> 16:37.997
-Most terrible thing.
-FRANK: You have a name?

16:38.080 --> 16:41.041
I got the next truck they're gonna hit.
It's what I got.

16:41.125 --> 16:42.167
From where?

16:42.251 --> 16:46.255
Oh, Frank. With all due respect,
I got to protect my sources.

16:46.338 --> 16:48.048
We make a bust, we'll work it out.

16:48.799 --> 16:50.092
I'll talk to the DA's office.

16:50.759 --> 16:53.595
Most reasonable men
always find a way, huh, Frankie?

16:53.679 --> 16:57.599
Bucky's Meat Supplies
makes a delivery every afternoon.

16:57.891 --> 17:00.060
-Sounds like today's the day.
-Where?

17:00.519 --> 17:03.105
It's all I got. Got to take it from there.

17:04.273 --> 17:06.692
So can my guys leave now?

17:06.775 --> 17:08.318
After the bust.

17:12.239 --> 17:14.158
Ray, would you come in here, please?

17:14.783 --> 17:17.745
Yo, Frank, sorry to hear about your loss.

17:17.828 --> 17:20.956
-The sergeant. That's too bad.
-Thank you.

17:21.957 --> 17:23.709
The guy had some stuff.

17:33.719 --> 17:36.180
-Joe.
-Hey, Luce.

17:37.014 --> 17:39.892
-How's Sandy doing?
-She's checking the books.

17:41.226 --> 17:44.563
-How you doing?
-I'm just trying to help out.

17:47.733 --> 17:49.735
I don't know
what I'm supposed to do, Luce.

17:50.986 --> 17:53.113
I mean, what can I do? It happened, right?

17:57.034 --> 17:58.368
But all I can see...

17:58.869 --> 18:02.289
All I can see in my mind is this animal
on top of her and I want to...

18:02.915 --> 18:04.374
I want to pull him off.

18:05.209 --> 18:06.293
And I want to kill him.

18:12.257 --> 18:13.300
That's how I'm doing.

18:23.727 --> 18:24.728
Here you go.

18:31.568 --> 18:34.363
Hi. Uh, could you look at these, too?

18:35.864 --> 18:38.617
(sighs) I didn't know
that there were all these faces.

18:38.700 --> 18:41.495
Yeah, I know. You just take them
one at a time, okay?

18:41.578 --> 18:43.580
(crying)

18:46.750 --> 18:51.130
-You okay?
-(sighs) Yeah, I'm fine.

18:53.423 --> 18:54.716
How are you, Joe?

18:55.551 --> 18:57.845
I'm okay. Why shouldn't I be?

19:00.722 --> 19:02.307
No reason. (sighs)

19:02.850 --> 19:04.226
I mean, I'm upset.

19:05.352 --> 19:06.520
Good, Joe.

19:07.312 --> 19:10.399
Hey, look, can I get you anything, Sandy?

19:11.358 --> 19:13.402
No thanks. Maybe later.

19:13.986 --> 19:15.404
Psst, J.D.

19:20.742 --> 19:22.119
-Yeah?
-Got a match up here.

19:22.202 --> 19:24.746
-Who is he?
-W4 on a Jorge Villa.

19:26.915 --> 19:28.709
Stopped working for the shop
about 13 months ago.

19:28.792 --> 19:30.752
-Uh-huh. Any priors?
-Mm-hmm.

19:30.836 --> 19:33.547
Two B&amp;Es. Two suspicions on rape,

19:33.630 --> 19:36.508
robbery, one dismissed,
other one's still pending.

19:36.592 --> 19:37.759
Easy, he should be in lockup.

19:37.843 --> 19:39.636
Should be is right.
The dude was just released

19:39.720 --> 19:43.515
from Michigan Avenue last night.
(mutters)

19:43.599 --> 19:45.934
-Hey.
-Mm-hmm.

19:47.644 --> 19:50.606
Hey, Sandy. I want you to take a look here

19:50.689 --> 19:53.358
and see if anyone in this bunch
looks familiar, okay?

19:59.823 --> 20:00.824
Where?

20:02.242 --> 20:04.077
That's the guy? You sure?

20:04.161 --> 20:05.662
-Yeah.
-Got an address.

20:05.746 --> 20:07.623
-Okay, let's take him.
-I'll get backups.

20:07.706 --> 20:10.667
Great. Listen, if we find this guy,

20:10.751 --> 20:12.628
you're gonna have to ID him in a lineup.

20:12.711 --> 20:14.504
Now he won't be able to see you.

20:15.130 --> 20:17.507
-Can you do that?
-Yeah.

20:18.217 --> 20:19.218
Okay.

20:23.055 --> 20:24.848
(sobbing)

20:30.729 --> 20:32.105
I understand, Leo.

20:32.689 --> 20:33.982
We all loved him.

20:34.900 --> 20:36.944
But you must not hide your grief.

20:39.071 --> 20:42.074
Rather we must share it.
Let it strengthen us.

20:42.532 --> 20:44.576
-It's-it's not that.
-No?

20:44.660 --> 20:45.494
What then?

20:46.495 --> 20:47.663
Oh, God.

20:48.205 --> 20:52.167
Oh, come on, Leo.
Please tell me. What is it?

20:54.544 --> 20:57.673
-I followed her last night.
-Who?

20:58.090 --> 21:01.009
She said she was going to
her aerobics class.

21:01.635 --> 21:04.680
But she hasn't been there in weeks.
I know, I called.

21:06.181 --> 21:07.724
So I followed her to this...

21:08.600 --> 21:10.435
computer software place

21:11.395 --> 21:12.980
at Ethel and Hollidorf.

21:13.522 --> 21:16.483
-That's where she met him.
-Who met who?

21:18.360 --> 21:21.655
My wife met Roger.

21:22.864 --> 21:26.743
Blond hair, six feet, sideburns.

21:27.786 --> 21:29.997
Goyim computer programmer.

21:31.415 --> 21:33.208
She's having an affair with him.

21:33.292 --> 21:36.295
Leo, you must confront her with this.

21:36.378 --> 21:38.088
I did on the spot.

21:38.755 --> 21:40.424
Sh-she got mad.

21:40.799 --> 21:44.511
Said he was the best thing
that had happened to her in years.

21:44.594 --> 21:46.513
She's not gonna give him up.

21:48.932 --> 21:51.643
Wanted to call her names.

21:52.060 --> 21:55.814
I couldn't. I love her too much.

21:56.898 --> 21:59.526
That's all right. That's all right.

22:09.911 --> 22:14.458
Oh, Judas, Leo.
I knew you would take it hardest of all.

22:16.043 --> 22:19.755
When a warrior falls,
there is no anguish more profound

22:19.838 --> 22:22.090
than that of his shield bearer.

22:22.174 --> 22:26.636
-It's not that.
-Leo has a personal problem, Howard.

22:28.972 --> 22:31.058
Nothing wrong with Mrs. Schnitz, I hope.

22:31.141 --> 22:33.352
-Oh, God.
-That's all right.

22:39.608 --> 22:40.567
Leo.

22:41.568 --> 22:42.903
The sarge is dead.

22:43.570 --> 22:46.698
He was a great guy. I'm sorry about it!

22:47.616 --> 22:49.659
But my wife is having an affair!

22:49.743 --> 22:52.037
Okay? You satisfied?

22:55.874 --> 22:57.125
(door slams)

22:58.126 --> 23:00.879
Police officers, ma'am.
Have to open it wider than that.

23:04.299 --> 23:06.426
We're looking to talk to your son, ma'am.
Jorge Villa.

23:06.510 --> 23:09.137
(speaks Spanish)

23:09.221 --> 23:11.223
-Neal.
-(metal rattling)

23:11.306 --> 23:13.892
Kind of chilly
for wide-open windows, señora.

23:16.061 --> 23:17.771
Hey, backups, the alley.

23:17.854 --> 23:19.189
Suspect in the alley.

23:21.191 --> 23:23.235
(siren wailing)

23:33.578 --> 23:34.996
Okay, hold it right there.

23:39.876 --> 23:41.878
Attaboy, Jorge.
You're under arrest, my man.

23:41.962 --> 23:45.215
-Would you like a donut?
-You have the right to remain silent...

23:52.848 --> 23:54.474
Leo, I'm so sorry.

24:05.694 --> 24:07.529
Mr. James, I'm Ms. Davenport.

24:08.447 --> 24:11.450
-I'll be your attorney.
-No complains here.

24:13.368 --> 24:16.496
You were arrested two days ago
on a shoplifting charge.

24:16.872 --> 24:18.999
Held for two days
at the Michigan Avenue complex

24:19.082 --> 24:21.460
and released last night
by order of Judge Cruz.

24:21.543 --> 24:22.752
Correcto.

24:23.253 --> 24:26.006
And by 11:00 you accumulated
a solicitation charge,

24:26.089 --> 24:28.800
possession of stolen credit cards,
possession of narcotics.

24:30.886 --> 24:33.763
That's the way of the world, ain't it?

24:34.806 --> 24:38.435
A guy like me, I mean,
good luck is like a rumor here.

24:43.190 --> 24:44.733
-Excuse me.
-No, excuse me.

24:44.816 --> 24:46.651
I'd like to see you in my office now.

24:50.822 --> 24:51.656
Let's hear it.

24:53.200 --> 24:55.577
Your client gave Lucy Bates
a credit card that used to belong to

24:55.660 --> 24:57.579
a Mrs. Virginia Kimble
of Clearwater, Florida,

24:57.662 --> 24:59.998
who was found dead in the trunk of her car
outside of Louisville.

25:00.081 --> 25:01.082
That doesn't give you the right to--

25:01.166 --> 25:04.961
And a routine check of fingerprints
turned up the name of Theodus Nickerson,

25:05.045 --> 25:07.506
escaped from Florida State Penitentiary
a week ago.

25:07.589 --> 25:10.467
Doing life for a double murder
in a gas station holdup.

25:10.550 --> 25:12.427
That's your client.
One of the people Judge Cruz

25:12.511 --> 25:14.387
saw fit to release as a low-risk criminal.

25:14.471 --> 25:16.640
Then the screw-up was in Florida, Frank.

25:16.723 --> 25:18.850
You can't release 247 criminals--

25:18.934 --> 25:21.394
Why didn't it show up
five days ago on the first bust?

25:21.478 --> 25:23.605
My best guess is laziness.

25:23.688 --> 25:26.149
So then what's the moral
of the story, Frank?

25:26.525 --> 25:28.276
Throw the shoplifters in the hole?

25:28.360 --> 25:30.987
-Or don't let convicted murderers escape?
-(knocks)

25:31.696 --> 25:33.281
Frank, Joyce.

25:33.698 --> 25:35.784
I just got the news about Phil Esterhaus.

25:35.867 --> 25:38.620
I came as fast as I could. I am so sorry.

25:40.038 --> 25:40.872
Thank you.

25:41.581 --> 25:44.000
God rest him. He lived a full life.

25:46.044 --> 25:48.588
Ray tells me you picked up
a murderer Judge Cruz

25:48.672 --> 25:51.633
decided to exercise
some selective mercy with.

25:51.716 --> 25:54.302
There seem to have been some
bureaucratic foul ups.

25:55.387 --> 25:57.889
Not enough so you couldn't make
some political hay.

25:58.765 --> 26:01.309
Better they stack 'em
six feet in the tombs.

26:01.393 --> 26:02.811
Like manhole covers.

26:05.188 --> 26:06.648
Obviously, she's upset.

26:07.983 --> 26:12.028
And I imagine the shock of Phil's passing
will be with all of us for some time.

26:12.654 --> 26:16.157
But, Frank, Phil would have been
the first to recognize

26:16.533 --> 26:18.577
the need for an orderly transition here.

26:19.077 --> 26:23.331
Now, I've selected three
of the department's toughest nuts.

26:23.415 --> 26:26.001
All with a lot of years behind the desk.

26:26.835 --> 26:28.003
You take your pick, Frank.

26:28.086 --> 26:30.422
I'll have them at the podium
tomorrow morning.

26:30.922 --> 26:34.551
Well, I guess I hadn't thought about it
quite this far yet, Chief.

26:34.634 --> 26:37.012
Frank, he was your friend,
that's understandable.

26:37.095 --> 26:38.722
It has occurred to me
that bringing somebody in

26:38.805 --> 26:41.850
from the outside might be...
somewhat disruptive.

26:41.933 --> 26:43.476
You want to keep it in the family, then?

26:43.560 --> 26:46.479
Uh, I think at least initially.

26:47.355 --> 26:48.607
All right, Frank.

26:50.025 --> 26:51.151
You tell me.

26:51.484 --> 26:53.194
Lucy Bates passed her exam.

26:53.903 --> 26:57.240
And she was second in line for promotion
when the freeze went into effect.

26:57.866 --> 27:00.660
All right, you want to take her
straight from patrol

27:00.744 --> 27:02.329
to turnout responsibilities?

27:02.412 --> 27:03.788
Yeah, I think I'd like to give her a shot.

27:05.332 --> 27:06.666
Well, I must admit, I'm skeptical,

27:06.750 --> 27:09.544
what with the more qualified
bodies available.

27:09.628 --> 27:11.463
It would only be temporary to start.

27:12.422 --> 27:14.924
But nobody's worked harder.
Nobody's more deserving.

27:15.008 --> 27:16.718
Well, it is your precinct.

27:17.010 --> 27:18.928
If you want to put a woman in that job,

27:19.012 --> 27:20.597
I guess there's nothing I can say,
is there?

27:21.264 --> 27:22.932
Freeze will come off this afternoon.

27:24.726 --> 27:26.645
Funeral arrangements in place?

27:29.606 --> 27:32.525
I guess, uh, I'm taking care of that.

27:35.362 --> 27:36.321
Dear Phil.

27:37.864 --> 27:39.616
Dreadful loss. Dreadful.

27:40.659 --> 27:41.743
Let me know.

27:51.211 --> 27:54.839
Just want you to know, Sergeant,
you've got my every confidence.

27:58.802 --> 28:01.971
RENKO: It's like a riddle
in a cosmic tapestry, Bobby Hill.

28:02.597 --> 28:04.391
Why that man meant as much to me

28:04.474 --> 28:07.143
as my own daddy
and I wished I could have told him so.

28:08.061 --> 28:10.397
-I wish I could tell him so now.
-(Mick groans)

28:12.065 --> 28:14.859
Now what prompted that comment
from the animal world?

28:16.945 --> 28:18.780
People should treat people good
when they're alive

28:18.863 --> 28:21.866
instead of trying to make up for it
after they're dead.

28:23.034 --> 28:25.537
You trying to tell me
that I'm less than sincere

28:25.620 --> 28:27.288
in my affections for that man?

28:27.956 --> 28:29.374
Esterhaus.

28:29.874 --> 28:31.918
His name was Esterhaus.

28:32.502 --> 28:33.795
And you caused him aggravation

28:33.878 --> 28:35.588
wising off in roll call
and ducking assignments...

28:35.672 --> 28:38.508
I suppose you never broke his nose
in intramural volleyball, did you?

28:38.591 --> 28:41.094
-That was an accident.
-Knock it off, guys.

28:41.177 --> 28:43.346
-He was my sergeant.
-An exceptional police officer.

28:43.430 --> 28:45.223
-He was my friend.
-Hey, knock it off.

28:45.306 --> 28:47.058
What is this, mom likes me best?

28:47.142 --> 28:49.853
-Have some respect.
-All right, what's going on here?

28:49.936 --> 28:51.062
-Nothing.
-Nothing, Mr. Nolan.

28:51.146 --> 28:52.272
We're ready to roll whenever you are.

28:52.355 --> 28:55.442
Yeah, but let's get this thing loaded.
Come on, who's driving?

28:55.525 --> 28:57.068
-Me.
-Ha.

28:58.027 --> 28:59.612
Let me see your Class Two license.

29:01.322 --> 29:02.824
You're looking at it.

29:02.907 --> 29:04.701
(laughs)

29:04.784 --> 29:08.830
Now what do you think is going in
the back of this thing, Mr. Police Badge?

29:08.913 --> 29:10.498
-Meat.
-Uh-uh.

29:11.124 --> 29:14.669
Twelve-thousand
of my hard-earned dollars is what.

29:14.753 --> 29:17.756
Now you can flash that badge
at a pork roast,

29:17.839 --> 29:21.092
and it's still gonna spoil
if it gets above 52 degrees

29:21.176 --> 29:22.427
longer than 30 minutes.

29:22.510 --> 29:25.096
You can flash that badge
at a side of beef,

29:25.180 --> 29:28.516
and it's still gonna bruise to the tune
of ten cents less a pound

29:28.600 --> 29:30.894
if it goes swinging around
in the back of that truck.

29:30.977 --> 29:33.062
So you just show me some proof
that you know something

29:33.146 --> 29:35.023
about driving a refrigerator unit,

29:35.106 --> 29:37.859
or I'm just gonna take my chances
with the hijackers.

29:39.068 --> 29:43.031
Mr. Nolan, my partner and I
can personally attest

29:43.114 --> 29:46.075
that this little gentleman
knows how to handle raw meat.

29:46.159 --> 29:48.661
(growls)

29:56.544 --> 29:57.587
What ramp?

29:58.963 --> 29:59.798
Three.

30:01.466 --> 30:02.884
(engine starts)

30:20.985 --> 30:23.530
Okay, let's get this sucker loaded.

30:23.613 --> 30:25.073
Look, I understand the urgency.

30:25.156 --> 30:27.450
My feeling is that this decision
would better be made

30:27.534 --> 30:28.993
by a professional, that's all.

30:32.622 --> 30:34.541
I see. All right.

30:34.624 --> 30:36.876
Well, I'll just have to
get back to you by 5:00, right?

30:36.960 --> 30:38.127
Okay. Thanks.

30:39.379 --> 30:41.381
What do you know
about executing an estate?

30:41.464 --> 30:45.343
Uh, enough to call legal referral
for the name of a qualified attorney.

30:45.426 --> 30:47.720
-How about giving away eyes?
-Eyes?

30:48.137 --> 30:50.431
Phil signed a donor's card.
Organ transplants.

30:51.349 --> 30:53.893
They've given me a list of 40 people
who need eyes.

30:53.977 --> 30:55.270
A little girl in Tulsa.

30:56.145 --> 30:58.398
Father of five in Green Bay.

30:58.481 --> 31:00.733
Law says as executor
I have to make the choice.

31:01.359 --> 31:02.569
Amazing, isn't it?

31:02.652 --> 31:04.988
Part of a man can go on living like this.

31:05.071 --> 31:07.031
Hi, Irwin. Uh, Frank.

31:07.866 --> 31:10.243
Sandy Valpariso is on her way back
from the rape treatment center.

31:10.326 --> 31:12.078
We can have a lineup ready
by the time she gets here.

31:12.161 --> 31:14.163
-Okay, let's put it together,
-How's it going?

31:14.247 --> 31:16.583
Oh, great. I haven't settled
with the fact that he's gone yet,

31:16.666 --> 31:18.543
and-and I'm parceling him out like--

31:19.669 --> 31:20.795
like a door prize.

31:21.796 --> 31:23.548
Is it true what I heard about him?

31:24.674 --> 31:25.758
What was that, Irwin?

31:26.384 --> 31:27.886
I don't mean this to sound cold,

31:28.469 --> 31:30.930
but I had some business
at the morgue this morning

31:31.014 --> 31:33.725
and I heard a rumor that he wasn't...

31:35.518 --> 31:37.312
dancing alone when the big one hit.

31:37.395 --> 31:39.105
I don't think we should
speculate about that, Irwin.

31:49.407 --> 31:51.659
WASHINGTON: Keep moving
all the way down to your marks.

31:52.201 --> 31:53.244
And face forward.

32:01.336 --> 32:02.420
That's him.

32:04.130 --> 32:05.924
Number two, second from the left.

32:07.800 --> 32:08.885
FRANK: Are you positive?

32:10.345 --> 32:12.847
Believe me,
I'm not gonna forget that face so soon.

32:15.600 --> 32:17.352
(crying)

32:24.150 --> 32:26.653
Okay, we're done, Ms. Valpariso.
Thank you.

32:29.113 --> 32:32.575
All right, that's it. Turn to your right
and move down the steps to the door.

32:41.167 --> 32:42.126
How you feeling?

32:44.253 --> 32:47.423
I'm sorry. It's just been a long day.

32:48.091 --> 32:49.592
You kidding? You've been great.

32:52.428 --> 32:53.930
So what next?

32:54.597 --> 32:55.723
Well, the way things are backed up,

32:55.807 --> 32:58.184
they probably won't arraign
before tomorrow morning.

32:58.851 --> 33:00.395
We'll call, let you know, okay?

33:01.104 --> 33:02.021
Thank you.

33:02.105 --> 33:03.898
-No problem.
-Thanks a lot.

33:19.747 --> 33:20.707
We got to get you a ride home.

33:21.374 --> 33:22.291
Not yet.

33:23.084 --> 33:25.336
Just sit with me for a few minutes, okay?

33:26.254 --> 33:27.088
What, here?

33:28.089 --> 33:28.923
Why not?

33:29.966 --> 33:31.592
Are you afraid to be alone with me?

33:32.844 --> 33:34.345
No, of course not.

33:43.438 --> 33:45.523
Joe, what is going on with you?

33:45.606 --> 33:47.942
Nothing. What-what are you talking about?

33:48.818 --> 33:50.737
All day long you've been so nice.

33:50.820 --> 33:53.239
The perfect gentleman, the perfect cop.

33:53.322 --> 33:55.533
But I feel like you
were a million miles away from me.

33:55.616 --> 33:57.535
Sandy, I've been with you every minute.

33:58.202 --> 34:00.580
All the way to the rape center and back
you barely said a word.

34:00.663 --> 34:03.791
And you haven't said anything to me today
that wasn't straight from the manual.

34:03.875 --> 34:05.960
I'm just used to
dealing with it a certain way.

34:06.044 --> 34:07.128
I mean, that's my job.

34:08.296 --> 34:10.923
We have been sleeping together
for two weeks.

34:11.007 --> 34:12.925
I am more than just your job.

34:13.342 --> 34:15.386
I just got to work out a few things.

34:15.470 --> 34:16.763
What things?

34:19.807 --> 34:22.435
I need to understand in my mind
what happened to you.

34:22.810 --> 34:24.520
What do you have to understand?

34:25.229 --> 34:27.607
A guy grabbed me.
He made me take off my clothes.

34:27.690 --> 34:30.276
He made me lie down
on a cold, dirty floor.

34:30.359 --> 34:31.944
-Stop it, Sandy.
-What?

34:32.487 --> 34:34.405
It's too unpleasant for you to hear?

34:35.406 --> 34:37.450
I lived through it, you jerk.

34:39.160 --> 34:40.620
I just need some time.

34:41.287 --> 34:44.457
I have to make myself
understand why it happened.

34:44.540 --> 34:46.167
What do you think I could have done?

34:46.959 --> 34:48.878
What would you do if you had some

34:48.961 --> 34:51.005
drug crazy pointing a knife
at your throat?

34:51.089 --> 34:53.758
-Put up a fight?
-I don't know. Maybe.

34:56.177 --> 34:57.261
Is that it?

34:57.678 --> 34:59.806
You think maybe
I didn't fight hard enough?

35:00.932 --> 35:02.350
Maybe that is what I think.

35:04.435 --> 35:07.814
I mean, you-you always hear about women
who get out of it

35:07.897 --> 35:10.817
by saying they're pregnant
or saying they have VD.

35:10.900 --> 35:13.653
Or something. Maybe I'm wondering
why you didn't try that.

35:13.736 --> 35:16.739
If he had bashed my face in
or slashed my throat,

35:16.823 --> 35:17.990
would that make you feel better?

35:18.074 --> 35:20.701
-Would that help you understand?
-No. No.

35:21.410 --> 35:22.745
It's just that...

35:24.831 --> 35:26.124
I don't know what to think.

35:34.215 --> 35:35.383
(sighs)

35:36.592 --> 35:39.679
Well, then, why don't you
just sit here for a few years

35:39.762 --> 35:41.514
and see what you can figure out?

35:55.027 --> 35:56.154
You know, If he don't get a move on,

35:56.237 --> 35:58.322
he's gonna be about seven minutes
behind his schedule.

35:58.406 --> 35:59.657
Will you lighten up?

35:59.866 --> 36:01.784
If they're looking for us,
they'll find us.

36:03.744 --> 36:07.290
Call Belker and tell him
that the back door latch has come loose.

36:08.541 --> 36:12.044
(sighs) Farmer Brown.
Farmer Brown, this is Meatloaf.

36:12.795 --> 36:14.839
<i>Your barn door</i>
<i>is about to open there, pal.</i>

36:14.922 --> 36:16.716
Make sure the cat don't get out.

36:16.799 --> 36:18.050
Watch your mouth, Renko,

36:18.134 --> 36:21.262
or you're gonna be the fattest
side of beef hanging in this truck.

36:21.345 --> 36:22.972
DISPATCHER (on radio):
<i>All units in the area</i>

36:23.055 --> 36:27.018
<i>of 315 South Polk Avenue,</i>
<i>robbery in progress, shots fired.</i>

36:27.894 --> 36:30.146
Hey, Meatloaf,
where the hell are you going?

36:30.229 --> 36:33.441
RENKO: <i>Farmer Brown, we got a robbery</i>
<i>in progress. We're taking it.</i>

36:33.524 --> 36:36.485
No, you're not. You call it in.
You're not leaving my rear end exposed.

36:38.070 --> 36:41.699
Hey, do you guys hear me? Get back here!

36:56.881 --> 36:57.798
Hey.

36:59.050 --> 37:02.053
You hit my van, you stupid jerk!

37:02.136 --> 37:03.846
What, you got your head
in your shorts or something?!

37:03.930 --> 37:05.389
I see it, I see it. I'm sorry.

37:05.473 --> 37:07.683
You're sorry? Get out of that truck,

37:07.767 --> 37:09.977
you sawed-off little wimp.
I'll show you who's sorry.

37:10.061 --> 37:12.104
Who you calling sawed-off, barf bag?

37:12.188 --> 37:15.024
You, you dwarf, numbnuts.

37:15.399 --> 37:16.984
No wonder you got in an accident.

37:17.068 --> 37:18.486
I'm a cop, mud brain.

37:19.153 --> 37:21.197
Good. 'Cause I'm suing you,

37:21.280 --> 37:22.990
-I'm suing the department.
-Don't crowd me.

37:23.074 --> 37:25.868
-And I'm suing the city.
-I'm telling you not to crowd me.

37:25.952 --> 37:27.328
Crowd you?

37:32.041 --> 37:34.335
Hey, put it back!

37:34.418 --> 37:36.921
Stop that! You're all under arrest!

37:37.004 --> 37:39.173
Get off me, you little runt!

37:40.216 --> 37:41.842
I give! I give!

37:42.134 --> 37:45.012
Get back here! I'm a police officer!

37:47.348 --> 37:49.600
(screams)

37:57.275 --> 37:58.609
Go on, get out of here.

38:08.286 --> 38:10.413
PEYSER: I'm taking a last pass
down Avenue C.

38:10.955 --> 38:12.707
Haven't seen not one hooker.

38:12.790 --> 38:14.417
LUCY (over radio):
<i>You sure you're on Avenue C?</i>

38:14.500 --> 38:15.584
Roger.

38:15.918 --> 38:17.878
Ain't nothing on this road but potholes.

38:18.170 --> 38:20.339
<i>Hard to believe.</i>
<i>Tell me what you're seeing.</i>

38:20.423 --> 38:24.719
Roger. Well, there's a couple of winos
working a trash can fire.

38:25.469 --> 38:28.431
There's a lady standing next to
a station wagon with her hood up.

38:28.806 --> 38:29.807
She waved at me.

38:29.890 --> 38:32.977
<i>Archie, that's an old gimmick</i>
<i>to fool patrol cars.</i>

38:33.060 --> 38:35.730
<i>They put up some guy's car hood</i>
<i>and just pretend it's theirs.</i>

38:35.813 --> 38:37.648
<i>Turn around, check it out, okay?</i>

38:37.732 --> 38:38.899
Roger. Will do.

38:51.078 --> 38:52.830
WOMAN: Oh, thank God.

38:52.913 --> 38:55.583
You are the answer to a woman's prayers.

38:55.666 --> 38:57.585
How would you like to take a peek
under my hood?

38:58.419 --> 38:59.337
And then what, lady?

38:59.420 --> 39:00.546
Then you give me a jump.

39:01.339 --> 39:03.424
Well, I have all the clamps and cords,

39:03.507 --> 39:05.926
you know, in the back.
They just hook right on.

39:06.010 --> 39:07.219
Sounds good.

39:07.928 --> 39:09.972
So what's this sort of thing worth to you?

39:10.056 --> 39:12.350
How much? Boy, you're a sport, mister.

39:12.725 --> 39:15.102
I don't know. It's so cold, ten bucks.

39:15.394 --> 39:18.189
Police officer. You're under arrest.
Unlawful solicitation.

39:18.272 --> 39:19.982
-Put your hands behind your back.
-Solicitation?

39:20.066 --> 39:22.943
Are you kidding? Solicitation?
My battery is dead.

39:23.027 --> 39:24.528
Don't make it any
harder on yourself, ma'am.

39:24.612 --> 39:26.197
You stated the act and the amount.

39:26.280 --> 39:28.574
-I don't believe this.
-You have the right to remain silent...

39:28.657 --> 39:31.952
-Are you-- this is absolutely crazy.
-Anything you say can, and will be...

39:32.703 --> 39:36.624
You can't believe for one moment
that I was really trying to get--

39:36.707 --> 39:40.169
(laughing) You thought
that I was asking you...

39:40.252 --> 39:43.339
How old are you? (laughing)

39:43.422 --> 39:46.384
Are you sure you're a real policeman
and not just on safety patrol?

39:46.467 --> 39:48.344
-Get in the car.
-Hey, hey, hey. Get my purse.

39:48.427 --> 39:50.346
(laughing) I can't believe--

39:50.429 --> 39:52.056
-Where we going, Hill Street?
-Yeah.

39:52.139 --> 39:53.307
Oh, good. I need a ride.

39:53.391 --> 39:57.269
Listen, at this time of day,
take a left at Euclid. It's a lot easier.

40:00.481 --> 40:02.233
-Yo, Frankie.
-FRANK: Jesus.

40:02.316 --> 40:04.944
Anybody call for a pickup? Two Diablos.

40:09.115 --> 40:09.949
What?

40:10.533 --> 40:14.495
Hey, your clown can't hold his meat
on the road, it's not my problem.

40:15.329 --> 40:16.205
Give us a minute.

40:17.206 --> 40:18.999
JESUS: I paid for the goods.

40:19.083 --> 40:23.337
Now you deliver, Frankie,
or your word is garbage on the streets.

40:28.676 --> 40:30.511
-Frank.
-Martinez and I had a deal.

40:31.470 --> 40:34.265
Based on information
you never had a chance to verify.

40:34.348 --> 40:35.683
How am I gonna sell that downtown?

40:35.766 --> 40:38.102
It's a lousy TV set, Irwin.
What's the big deal?

40:38.185 --> 40:40.813
Okay, Frank, you do what you have to do.

40:40.896 --> 40:41.814
(scoffs)

40:42.398 --> 40:44.942
Meat supplier filed an $8,000 claim.

40:45.276 --> 40:48.279
Driver of the van is bringing suit
for abuse of process.

40:48.362 --> 40:52.116
Our hijackers are doing business as usual.
Why not make the disaster complete?

40:52.199 --> 40:53.242
Sorry.

40:58.289 --> 40:59.248
Leo.

41:00.416 --> 41:03.085
Would you turn over?
We keep our part of the deal.

41:03.169 --> 41:06.755
Would you turn over the two Diablos
to custody of Mr. Martinez here?

41:06.839 --> 41:09.800
-Right, Captain.
-Good decision, Frankie.

41:09.884 --> 41:11.802
Got to go by the rules, you know?

41:13.053 --> 41:15.139
Be the executor of my will, too,
okay, Frank?

41:15.931 --> 41:17.349
I know how you must feel, Leo.

41:18.767 --> 41:20.311
You waiting to see me, Luce?

41:24.315 --> 41:25.774
(door closes)

41:28.068 --> 41:30.446
-What's up?
-I'm not sure.

41:30.863 --> 41:33.407
Earlier today the chief came up to me,
slapped me on the back,

41:33.491 --> 41:34.825
called me sergeant.

41:35.493 --> 41:36.535
You know what he was talking about?

41:37.661 --> 41:40.748
We had a discussion this morning
about the desk sergeant vacancy.

41:40.831 --> 41:42.333
We decided the best course
would be to move

41:42.416 --> 41:44.293
somebody up from the inside,
so I recommended you.

41:44.376 --> 41:46.337
Me take the sergeant's place?

41:47.087 --> 41:49.340
(scoffs) Forget about it. No way.

41:49.423 --> 41:51.258
I couldn't fill his shoes
in a thousand years.

41:51.550 --> 41:53.302
Don't even try. Just be your own person.

41:53.886 --> 41:54.887
I don't know.

41:57.348 --> 42:00.100
I mean, I've been wanting it
for a long time, but...

42:01.644 --> 42:03.729
the circumstances, it's all wrong.

42:04.021 --> 42:05.689
Lucy, you've put in a lot of hard work

42:05.773 --> 42:07.691
to make sergeant.
It shouldn't be a punishment.

42:07.775 --> 42:09.109
Why don't you take some time
to think it over?

42:09.193 --> 42:12.196
If you're still uncomfortable,
we'll try something else, that's all.

42:12.613 --> 42:14.532
But I still think
you're the best person for the job.

42:15.366 --> 42:16.617
If you say so, Captain.

42:16.700 --> 42:19.286
Let's keep it under wraps
for a couple of days though, huh?

42:19.370 --> 42:21.664
You know, till we can make
an orderly transition.

42:26.126 --> 42:27.670
Is it appropriate to say thanks?

42:28.420 --> 42:29.755
Congratulations, Sergeant.

42:40.266 --> 42:43.060
Yo, mama.
Where did you get those fancy bracelets?

42:43.143 --> 42:44.979
Keep away from me, guttersnipe.

42:45.062 --> 42:47.606
Touchy, touchy.
Some prize you got there, Officer.

42:47.690 --> 42:49.149
-You know that?
-What?

42:49.817 --> 42:51.360
You better get some thick shoes.

42:51.443 --> 42:53.904
You're standing in the dog's business.

42:53.988 --> 42:56.740
-What?
-That's the captain's old lady.

42:56.824 --> 42:57.950
Sign these.

42:59.952 --> 43:02.538
-Mrs. Furillo?
-Furillo?

43:02.871 --> 43:05.374
Fast Fay, Leo.
The strumpet of State Street.

43:05.457 --> 43:07.459
-A fallen woman.
-Get her out of those cuffs.

43:07.543 --> 43:09.837
Gee, I'm sorry, ma'am.
I didn't know, really.

43:09.920 --> 43:11.589
I'm an idiot. I'm a moron.

43:11.672 --> 43:14.800
Hey, I've been looking for
you two amateurs.

43:14.883 --> 43:17.636
You were supposed to be backing me up.
Now where the hell were you?

43:17.720 --> 43:20.306
We had an all units, Mick. We radioed you.

43:20.389 --> 43:22.308
Somebody could have
gotten killed out there.

43:22.391 --> 43:25.728
Way I heard it, somebody didn't know
where somebody was going, now did you?

43:25.811 --> 43:27.021
How come you're always around

43:27.104 --> 43:29.857
with your fat mouth
when I don't need you, Renko?

43:29.940 --> 43:32.484
Come on, Mick, think the sergeant
would approve you talking like that?

43:32.568 --> 43:35.821
(both shouting)

43:35.904 --> 43:37.948
No! I said no!

43:40.409 --> 43:41.994
Look, I'm not insensitive to the fact

43:42.077 --> 43:44.663
that Phil Esterhaus' death
has hit us all pretty hard.

43:48.751 --> 43:50.961
But if you respect his memory,
you'll be what he was.

43:51.045 --> 43:53.380
You'll honor it by being what he was.

43:53.464 --> 43:55.799
A gentleman and a good cop.

44:09.730 --> 44:12.316
I'm sorry, Fay.
That was no way for you to find out.

44:12.399 --> 44:13.484
Phil's dead?

44:15.152 --> 44:16.320
When? Where?

44:21.909 --> 44:23.619
At home, early this morning.

44:26.789 --> 44:28.165
Oh. (shudders)

44:33.462 --> 44:35.881
He-he taught Frank Jr. how to box.

44:37.883 --> 44:40.177
-(chattering)
-(music playing)

44:52.898 --> 44:54.441
I hear he died in the saddle.

44:54.525 --> 44:57.695
-That's a lot of crap.
-Just what I heard, Mick.

44:58.570 --> 45:00.906
Hey, anybody heard any rumors
about who's gonna replace him?

45:00.989 --> 45:03.784
Can't we at least wait
until the body gets cold?

45:04.618 --> 45:05.661
Scenario.

45:05.744 --> 45:08.455
Foster up in the Heights
retired last month.

45:08.539 --> 45:11.917
Jaffey in South Ferry,
he bit the biscuit a couple weeks ago.

45:12.000 --> 45:14.461
Mayor's office lifts the freeze on hiring.

45:14.545 --> 45:17.715
He gets the stripes, and just like that
we got ourselves a new sarge.

45:17.798 --> 45:21.301
Hey, nobody's said anything
about anybody replacing the sarge.

45:21.385 --> 45:22.720
So let's just drop it.

45:22.803 --> 45:24.388
RENKO: I propose a toast.

45:25.806 --> 45:27.099
To the sarge.

45:28.183 --> 45:29.143
We loved him.

45:30.185 --> 45:31.228
We're gonna miss him.

45:33.105 --> 45:34.064
God bless him.

45:34.648 --> 45:35.524
Hear, hear.

45:37.151 --> 45:38.360
Yeah, I loved him, too.

45:39.695 --> 45:41.029
What a sex life.

45:41.613 --> 45:44.533
J.D., go kill yourself.

45:46.994 --> 45:48.328
You know, when I was first up here,

45:48.954 --> 45:51.623
you got the feeling
he really liked you, you know?

45:51.707 --> 45:52.541
Deep down.

45:53.584 --> 45:55.878
Like he just liked people.

45:55.961 --> 45:57.296
I guess he went out liking someone.

45:57.379 --> 46:00.799
-Ba-bing. Ba-bing.
-(laughing)

46:00.883 --> 46:03.302
MICK:
It didn't happen like that, you jerk.

46:03.385 --> 46:05.220
I don't believe that that happened.

46:06.430 --> 46:08.640
Well, then why don't we call the captain?

46:08.724 --> 46:11.226
Great, yeah. He'll love you for it.

46:11.310 --> 46:14.438
It is our right
under the Freedom of Information Act.

46:14.521 --> 46:16.940
Tender me a dime here there, brother.

46:20.486 --> 46:23.113
-(phone rings)
-Furillo.

46:23.197 --> 46:25.949
-Captain Furillo?
-FRANK: <i>Who is this?</i>

46:26.033 --> 46:29.244
-Andrew Renko, sir. How are you?
-Fine.

46:29.870 --> 46:32.498
<i>Uh, sir,</i>
<i>I hope we didn't wake your wife and you,</i>

46:32.581 --> 46:35.959
<i>but we're all down here at Mulligan's</i>
<i>sort of toasting the sarge.</i>

46:36.043 --> 46:39.046
Me, Bobby Hill, J.D., Neal,

46:39.922 --> 46:42.549
Lucille Bates, Joe, Belker, Leo.

46:42.633 --> 46:44.259
What can I do for you, Andy?

46:44.343 --> 46:47.679
Well, sir, uh,
in paying our respects and all,

46:47.763 --> 46:51.767
we-we got to thinking about
life and death and...

46:52.518 --> 46:56.396
And how we all sort of

46:56.480 --> 46:58.190
<i>have a fleeting moment in the sun</i>

46:58.273 --> 47:02.277
and how we all have to plant our flag
on this Earth as it were, and...

47:03.612 --> 47:07.658
Well, sir, we got to speculating
about the sergeant's flag and all, and...

47:07.991 --> 47:09.535
You want to get to what this is all about?

47:09.618 --> 47:11.203
(sighs) Sir...

47:12.246 --> 47:15.457
Is it true he deceased himself
whilst in the act?

47:16.792 --> 47:17.876
Yes, it's true.

47:17.960 --> 47:21.088
Damn, that is a hell of a good way
to check out, isn't it?

47:21.171 --> 47:22.756
Of course,
it couldn't have been no tea party

47:22.840 --> 47:25.175
-for his paramour, now could it?
-Good night, Andy.

47:25.676 --> 47:26.677
Good night, sir.

47:31.473 --> 47:34.518
-Renko?
-Yeah, wanting to know if...

47:36.270 --> 47:37.646
it was true how Phil died.

47:38.689 --> 47:40.148
A legend is born.

47:43.652 --> 47:44.611
I'll miss him.

47:54.872 --> 47:55.914
So will I.

47:57.749 --> 47:58.792
Want to make love?

48:02.045 --> 48:03.797
It could cost you your life.

48:05.883 --> 48:06.884
I'll risk it.

48:23.025 --> 48:26.028
(closing theme playing)
