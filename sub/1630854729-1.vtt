09:27.654 --> 09:28.959
-Doesn't ring a bell.

09:29.003 --> 09:30.439
-You also called him
"a pathetic,

09:30.482 --> 09:33.094
whiny, wheezy jackass twig."

09:33.137 --> 09:36.880
-Oh, that I remember.

09:36.924 --> 09:38.273
That was a very long time ago.

09:38.316 --> 09:40.841
You know, my practicing days
are behind me.

09:40.884 --> 09:43.539
Nowadays, I'm in more
of a supportive role.

09:43.583 --> 09:45.236
-Teaching?
-I'm a process server.

09:45.280 --> 09:46.977
The look on someone's face
when you tell them

09:47.021 --> 09:50.067
they've been served at
their kid's flag football game,

09:50.111 --> 09:52.548
priceless.

09:52.592 --> 09:54.463
-Hmm.

09:54.506 --> 09:56.552
The guy with all those
thank you cards

09:56.596 --> 09:57.901
must like people
a little bit.

09:57.945 --> 09:59.729
-Occasionally with the subpoena,
I'll throw in

09:59.773 --> 10:01.731
a little free legal advice,
just so that the poor bastards

10:01.775 --> 10:04.952
don't do something
utterly stupid.

10:04.995 --> 10:07.171
And they'll thank me
with a card,

10:07.215 --> 10:11.872
or 26 pounds
of black market ribeyes.

10:11.915 --> 10:13.438
Here.

10:13.482 --> 10:16.093
One for the road?
Don't ask where they came from.

10:16.137 --> 10:17.834
These cows have seen stuff.

10:22.491 --> 10:24.188
-Come to the courthouse tonight.

10:24.232 --> 10:25.668
I could really use
some pointers.

10:25.712 --> 10:27.322
I've been a judge upstate,
but night court is --

10:27.365 --> 10:29.237
-A non-stop freak show.
A fetid swamp.

10:29.280 --> 10:32.762
Am I close?
Come on, you know I'm close.

10:32.806 --> 10:34.634
-It's different.

10:34.677 --> 10:36.940
Please? You're the only person
I know

10:36.984 --> 10:38.681
who gets how that world works,

10:38.725 --> 10:41.858
or at least the only
person who's still around.

10:46.602 --> 10:48.299
-Yeah, okay.

10:48.343 --> 10:50.214
I'll stop by.

10:50.258 --> 10:52.434
So now, as I said,
it's been quite awhile

10:52.477 --> 10:54.088
since I entertained.

10:54.131 --> 10:55.872
How do you get someone to leave?

11:04.141 --> 11:07.188
-Tell me a story, board.

11:07.231 --> 11:08.798
Who hurt you?

11:08.842 --> 11:11.758
Oh, I can't believe this is
happening on my watch.

11:11.801 --> 11:13.585
-Is there a world in which
you're taking this

11:13.629 --> 11:17.328
a little too seriously?
-Oh, Neil.

11:17.372 --> 11:19.983
Innocent, naive, simple,

11:20.027 --> 11:22.899
narrow-hipped Neil.

11:22.943 --> 11:24.727
I wish I could tell you
the world was all

11:24.771 --> 11:27.599
sunshine and flapjacks, but this
is no isolated incident.

11:27.643 --> 11:29.863
Or have you forgotten
the events of last Thursday,

11:29.906 --> 11:32.126
when our courtroom's
light bulbs were swapped out

11:32.169 --> 11:34.781
for fingerling potatoes?

11:34.824 --> 11:37.348
-It's just a dumb joke, it's not
like anybody's gonna believe

11:37.392 --> 11:40.003
Gary Buttmouth
is a real person?

11:40.047 --> 11:43.528
-I'm looking for Gary Buttmouth?

11:43.572 --> 11:45.792
-You think there's a
Gary Buttmouth working here

11:45.835 --> 11:48.011
and his office is --

11:48.055 --> 11:50.013
1814.

11:50.057 --> 11:52.015
He's coming for me.

11:52.059 --> 11:53.713
That's my office.

11:55.758 --> 11:57.455
-So, I'm going to ask you
one more time.

11:57.499 --> 11:58.761
Who threw the first punch?

11:58.805 --> 12:01.764
-[Both] He did.
I did? You did!

12:01.808 --> 12:04.593
-Cut it out!
Cut it out!

12:06.682 --> 12:08.423
-Maybe we should just let them
kill each other.

12:08.466 --> 12:10.120
It's basically Thunderdome
around here

12:10.164 --> 12:11.774
without a public
defender.

12:14.777 --> 12:16.344
-Let's take five.
-You don't want to just rule

12:16.387 --> 12:21.349
real quick?
Or take five. Maybe 10.

12:21.392 --> 12:23.960
-Hey, Sally.
Yes, it's me.

12:24.004 --> 12:27.007
Let's not make a big deal
about it, okay?

12:27.050 --> 12:29.357
-So is it weird being back?

12:29.400 --> 12:30.967
Like going to your old
high school?

12:31.011 --> 12:32.577
-No, more like a trip
to the dentist.

12:32.621 --> 12:34.275
Slightly unpleasant, and there's

12:34.318 --> 12:35.755
a decent chance a total stranger

12:35.798 --> 12:38.714
will try to stick
their hand in your mouth.

12:41.586 --> 12:43.588
-So, you want to check out
my dad's old chambers?

12:43.632 --> 12:45.765
I bet that box of stuff we found
will bring back memories

12:45.808 --> 12:47.810
of your glory days.
-No, thank you.

12:47.854 --> 12:49.856
I prefer leaving the past
in the past.

12:49.899 --> 12:54.512
If these walls could talk,
they'd say, "Kill me."

12:54.556 --> 12:57.820
-Oh, Olivia Moore,
this is Dan Fielding.

12:57.864 --> 13:00.257
He used to be the Assistant
District Attorney of this court.

13:00.301 --> 13:04.784
-Oh, wow, a former night court
Assistant District Attorney.

13:04.827 --> 13:07.612
Of all the days to leave
my selfie stick at home.

13:07.656 --> 13:09.571
-Well, you could always tape
your phone

13:09.614 --> 13:13.314
to that stick up your --
-Oh.

13:13.357 --> 13:14.881
I am liking this back and forth.

13:14.924 --> 13:17.100
Maybe it's just me,
but I would love to see you two

13:17.144 --> 13:19.276
squaring off every night.
-Mm-hmm.

13:19.320 --> 13:21.191
Judge, may I have a word?

13:21.235 --> 13:23.933
-I'm gonna go get some coffee.

13:23.977 --> 13:25.717
Alone.

13:28.155 --> 13:31.636
-I don't want to question your
usually impeccable judgment,

13:31.680 --> 13:33.856
but if you think
Truck Stop Santa's

13:33.900 --> 13:37.077
gonna be our new public
defender, you're delusional.

13:37.120 --> 13:38.861
-I think he'd be perfect.

13:38.905 --> 13:42.125
-Self-centered narcissists
aren't public defenders.

13:42.169 --> 13:44.084
We're prosecutors.

13:44.127 --> 13:46.738
-Okay, yes, he shot me down
once, but I think with

13:46.782 --> 13:51.265
a little push, I can get him
to a solid maybe.

13:51.308 --> 13:53.267
Okay, open your eyes.

13:53.310 --> 13:54.659
-I never closed them.

13:54.703 --> 13:56.836
Wait a minute.
I know these people.

13:56.879 --> 13:58.838
These are all people
I've served.

13:58.881 --> 14:01.318
Oh, wait, wait, am I dying and
only the most irrelevant parts

14:01.362 --> 14:03.668
of my life
are flashing before my eyes?

14:03.712 --> 14:05.714
-These aren't just people
you served.

14:05.757 --> 14:07.368
These are lives you've changed.

14:07.411 --> 14:09.196
-Look, I appreciate you trying
to give me

14:09.239 --> 14:10.806
a billiard ball moment,

14:10.850 --> 14:13.591
but I like my life
the way it is, thank you.

14:13.635 --> 14:16.377
-You say you're happy all alone,
ordering takeout

14:16.420 --> 14:18.553
and stockpiling freezer meat,

14:18.596 --> 14:20.555
but I think
you could thrive here.

14:20.598 --> 14:22.252
Don't you want that
for yourself?

14:22.296 --> 14:24.037
-Why are we talking about me?
You're the one that needs help.

14:24.080 --> 14:25.777
-Oh, I just said that to get you
to come here.

14:25.821 --> 14:27.997
-You sure about that, because
last time I checked your

14:28.041 --> 14:30.608
public defender quit, you're
driving your clerk insane,

14:30.652 --> 14:32.915
and is that ketchup
on your robe?

14:32.959 --> 14:35.787
-I'll have you know
that might be twin blood.

14:35.831 --> 14:38.007
Look, I'm just trying to do
the right thing,

14:38.051 --> 14:40.314
and if people aren't on
board for that, that's on them.

14:40.357 --> 14:43.534
-Your problem is that you think
being right matters.

14:43.578 --> 14:45.797
Yeah, good judges
decide what's right.

14:45.841 --> 14:48.017
Great judges convincepeople.

14:48.061 --> 14:50.933
That's what made your father
so special.

14:50.977 --> 14:53.588
When he wasn't zapping people
with joy buzzers

14:53.631 --> 14:56.373
or stuffing springy
snakes into everything.

14:56.417 --> 14:57.940
Because of that man,
it was a decade

14:57.984 --> 15:00.508
before I could eat
a canned nut.

15:02.466 --> 15:04.077
-So now you want to talk
about the past?

15:04.120 --> 15:05.600
-If you don't like what I have
to say,

15:05.643 --> 15:07.384
next time you find
an address in a box,

15:07.428 --> 15:09.299
why don't you
just leave it there?

15:09.343 --> 15:10.953
-Sure, because keeping things
boxed up

15:10.997 --> 15:13.303
seems to be your thing --
your past, your feelings,

15:13.347 --> 15:14.739
you've put your whole life
in a box

15:14.783 --> 15:16.306
and won't let anyone in.
-Wait, hold on a second.

15:16.350 --> 15:18.395
Am I in the box or am
I putting things in the box?

15:18.439 --> 15:19.614
-I kind of lost the thread.
-Yeah.

15:19.657 --> 15:20.920
-The point is,

15:20.963 --> 15:22.965
you're afraid
to open that box.

15:23.009 --> 15:24.575
-You know what?
It was lovely meeting you,

15:24.619 --> 15:26.055
and good luck with
the saving the world thing.

15:26.099 --> 15:30.103
I am sure that it's gonna
happen any day now.

15:30.146 --> 15:31.756
-I'm gonna pretend
you're being sincere,

15:31.800 --> 15:35.804
and there's nothing
you can do about it!

15:38.850 --> 15:40.156
-I tried everything!
Following the money,

15:40.200 --> 15:44.421
police psychic,
unlikely partner to a dog,

15:44.465 --> 15:46.597
going undercover as a teen.

15:46.641 --> 15:48.469
-How many of those
did you actually do?

15:48.512 --> 15:50.427
-You're missing the point --
all this work,

15:50.471 --> 15:51.994
and I came up
with jack diddly squat,

15:52.038 --> 15:54.257
which incidentally,
is a name on the board.

15:54.301 --> 15:58.435
This guy is
a criminal master mind, like --

15:58.479 --> 16:00.829
like a Hannibal.

16:03.223 --> 16:04.964
Or it's "Fight Club."

16:08.837 --> 16:11.057
Maybe I really am
Gary Buttmouth.

16:11.100 --> 16:13.102
No, no, no, no.

16:13.146 --> 16:15.583
I gotta hurry up and stop me
before I do something

16:15.626 --> 16:17.889
I can't even believe
I'm capable of.

16:21.067 --> 16:23.634
-Are you gonna tell her
it was you?

16:25.854 --> 16:27.464
-My job isn't exactly
fulfilling,

16:27.508 --> 16:31.120
so I've got to find ways to keep
my brain from eating itself.

16:32.730 --> 16:34.428
You're not gonna rat me out,
are you?

16:34.471 --> 16:35.777
-No.

16:35.820 --> 16:37.387
You've got to cool it, though.

16:37.431 --> 16:38.823
I've already lost
a public defender.

16:38.867 --> 16:40.347
If I lose a bailiff,
you might be next.

16:40.390 --> 16:43.872
-Knowing my luck, I might
just end up in a later court.

16:46.266 --> 16:48.529
-So if court clerk isn't
your dream job, what is?

16:48.572 --> 16:50.400
-Oh, no.
No, no, no.

16:50.444 --> 16:51.923
You're not doing
that thing to me.

16:51.967 --> 16:53.795
-What thing?
-That thing where you

16:53.838 --> 16:55.057
ask questions and dig deeper

16:55.101 --> 16:56.798
and turn a simple
jaywalking charge

16:56.841 --> 16:58.408
into a full-on therapy session.

16:58.452 --> 17:00.193
I mean, I'm glad Ellie made
a major breakthrough.

17:00.236 --> 17:02.630
She can't be the son her
father always wanted her to be,

17:02.673 --> 17:03.979
and that's his issue,
not hers.

17:04.022 --> 17:07.200
And why do I know any of this?

17:07.242 --> 17:09.637
-Yeah, I guess I'm always
looking for what's

17:09.680 --> 17:12.683
going on underneath.

17:12.727 --> 17:15.164
My dad used to do a lot
of magic tricks,

17:15.208 --> 17:16.905
and whenever I asked him
how they were done,

17:16.948 --> 17:19.038
he would say, "It's magic."

17:19.080 --> 17:20.778
Drove me crazy.

17:20.821 --> 17:22.301
He thought if I knew
how they worked,

17:22.345 --> 17:24.694
I wouldn't like them as much,
but to me,

17:24.739 --> 17:26.696
the truth was the magic.

17:26.741 --> 17:28.134
I feel that way about people.

17:28.176 --> 17:29.744
It's hard not to like them
once you know

17:29.787 --> 17:32.399
what's going on underneath.

17:32.442 --> 17:35.489
I see how that makes me a pain
in the butt as a judge

17:35.532 --> 17:37.708
and as a fan of magic.

17:37.752 --> 17:39.710
And as an Uber passenger.

17:41.364 --> 17:45.629
-I guess I could take a closer
look at the docket,

17:45.673 --> 17:47.544
find a little more time
for digging in.

17:47.588 --> 17:49.155
-Neil, that would be amazing!

17:49.198 --> 17:50.895
-But just a little more, like,
five minutes here and there.

17:50.939 --> 17:52.462
-I'm hearing 10!
-You're hearing five!

17:52.506 --> 17:55.378
-Nine?
-You're gonna do
whatever you want anyway.

17:55.422 --> 17:57.163
-You get me, Neil!

18:04.605 --> 18:06.955
-Afraid to open a box.

18:09.958 --> 18:11.655
Huh.

18:13.527 --> 18:16.225
Well, this place hasn't changed,

18:16.269 --> 18:21.404
right down to the guy fishing
dead birds out of the ceiling.

18:21.448 --> 18:23.058
Hey, you know what?

18:23.102 --> 18:25.408
I wanted to ask you something.

18:25.452 --> 18:29.108
Say a lifetime ago,
you worked with a guy, right?

18:29.151 --> 18:32.415
Had your ups and downs, but on
the whole, like each other --

18:32.459 --> 18:34.896
respected, even.

18:34.939 --> 18:38.247
The job ends.
You go your separate ways.

18:38.291 --> 18:41.816
Life happens.
You live and you love.

18:41.859 --> 18:44.862
And you lose, big time,

18:44.906 --> 18:49.302
so you close off your heart.

18:49.345 --> 18:53.262
Then one day, the child of that
almost forgotten guy

18:53.306 --> 18:57.266
comes to you
and asks for your help.

18:57.310 --> 18:58.876
Would you take the chance?

18:58.920 --> 19:02.271
Would you...
open that heart up again,

19:02.315 --> 19:07.015
let feelings in,
knowing that undoubtedly,

19:07.058 --> 19:11.933
it would hurt again
at some point?

19:11.976 --> 19:15.154
-There is a saying
in my country.

19:15.197 --> 19:17.678
"When man is holding dead bird,

19:17.721 --> 19:20.159
tell shorter story."

19:22.857 --> 19:26.034
-And that is why I don't
open up to people.

19:28.906 --> 19:32.127
But I am not afraid
to open a box.

19:32.171 --> 19:34.260
Oh! Harry!

19:38.568 --> 19:39.917
Okay.

19:39.961 --> 19:43.704
I'll think about it.

19:45.619 --> 19:48.187
-To save time, can we just do
all the public urinations

19:48.230 --> 19:51.233
at once?

19:51.277 --> 19:53.627
-Sure.

19:53.670 --> 19:56.325
Guilty. Guilty.

19:56.369 --> 19:58.197
Impressive, but guilty.

20:01.374 --> 20:03.071
Come on, man.

20:07.206 --> 20:09.512
-Oh, to try a case that doesn't
involve genitals.

20:09.556 --> 20:11.340
That'd be the dream.

20:11.384 --> 20:15.736
-Your Honor, Dan Fielding
for the defense.

20:17.390 --> 20:19.218
-Wait, you --
you actually got him?

20:19.261 --> 20:22.569
-Maybe there's a chance I'm not
being catfished after all.

20:22.612 --> 20:24.397
-We've never met,
but you...

20:24.440 --> 20:26.355
definitely are.

20:26.399 --> 20:29.140
-Get that perfectly normal neck
over here.

20:29.184 --> 20:30.881
-Alright, look, I just want
to say this one thing.

20:30.925 --> 20:34.276
I'm only here to help out
temporarily, a few days.

20:34.320 --> 20:37.148
-I'm hearing weeks.
-If you keep smiling like that,

20:37.192 --> 20:40.021
I'm out of here right now,
so just knock it off.

20:40.064 --> 20:43.546
That's better.
-Better, Your Honor.

20:43.590 --> 20:45.461
-I'm already regretting this.

20:47.333 --> 20:49.335
-I'd like to know
how you did this.

20:49.378 --> 20:51.728
-Maybe it's just magic.
-You have no idea, do you?

20:51.772 --> 20:53.295
-No freaking clue.

20:53.339 --> 20:55.819
-Well, whatever you did,
you pulled it out.

20:55.863 --> 20:59.606
-Speaking of pulling it out --

20:59.649 --> 21:01.912
Sorry, too easy.

21:01.956 --> 21:03.914
Mr. Gates was brought in
for lewd conduct.

21:03.958 --> 21:06.743
Obviously, this man
is a depraved menace

21:06.787 --> 21:09.180
and has no place
in decent society.

21:09.224 --> 21:11.705
-Oh, Mr. Fielding, I'd just like
to remind you,

21:11.748 --> 21:13.446
you're the defense.

21:17.667 --> 21:20.235
-Your Honor,

21:20.279 --> 21:23.107
my client --
dare I say my friend --

21:23.151 --> 21:25.196
is an outstanding pillar
of his community

21:25.240 --> 21:26.937
and we are wasting
the court's time

21:26.981 --> 21:30.027
with this gross miscarriage
of justice.

21:30.071 --> 21:31.507
If you'll indulge me,

21:31.551 --> 21:33.770
I'd just like to know
what's underneath all this.

21:33.814 --> 21:37.078
-You're the judge.
-No! Oh! Just...

21:42.692 --> 21:44.346
And I left my house for this.

21:48.002 --> 21:49.395
-It's funny!

21:49.438 --> 21:53.007
