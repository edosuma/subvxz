WEBVTT

00:08.280 --> 00:10.510
Everybody limbo.

00:10.720 --> 00:12.392
How low can you go?

00:17.160 --> 00:18.673
I made it.

00:24.720 --> 00:26.711
I didn't.

00:28.080 --> 00:30.275
Lower the bar, boys.
I'm playing to lose.

00:30.480 --> 00:32.357
Stop the music.

00:32.560 --> 00:34.551
I have good news, No Ma'amers.

00:34.760 --> 00:37.991
This Tuesday will be amateur night
at the Jiggly Room.

00:38.200 --> 00:41.829
- Cool.
- Kind of like open pole night.

00:42.600 --> 00:44.750
A Hooter coming-out party.

00:46.280 --> 00:48.874
Hey, Iqbal, that's just one
of your schemes to make money.

00:49.080 --> 00:51.230
Remember he tried to make us pay
a cover charge?

00:51.440 --> 00:53.908
Then an " uncover" charge?

00:54.840 --> 00:56.831
Too bad you're such Negative Neds.

00:57.040 --> 01:00.077
I was just going to ask
if you'd judge the contest.

01:00.280 --> 01:01.918
- Hey.
- Yeah.

01:02.120 --> 01:04.587
You know, Iqbal, for a guy with
an 18-drink minimum...

01:04.800 --> 01:06.472
...you're all right.

01:06.760 --> 01:10.673
Raise the bimbo,
it's time to limbo!

01:12.000 --> 01:18.074

01:54.000 --> 01:56.036
Forget it, Bud.

01:59.200 --> 02:03.830
There is no way that I am going to be
the " before" girl for a diet ad.

02:04.040 --> 02:07.077
Kelly, you'll look great in the "after"
shots. What's the big deal?

02:07.280 --> 02:10.192
The big deal is that I have to gain
30 pounds in one week.

02:10.400 --> 02:13.517
I mean, that's like a pound a day.

02:15.600 --> 02:17.158
It's not possible.

02:17.360 --> 02:18.395
Yes, it is, Kelly.

02:18.600 --> 02:22.115
Grandma Wanker gains that much
every time we go to Sizzler.

02:22.760 --> 02:24.512
Well, if the camera adds 10 pounds...

02:24.720 --> 02:27.188
...why can't they just use
three cameras?

02:28.080 --> 02:29.991
Kelly, listen.

02:30.200 --> 02:32.668
Lots of famous actors
gain weight for their parts.

02:32.880 --> 02:36.111
Robert De Niro, Tom Hanks.

02:36.720 --> 02:38.915
And you know Free Willy?

02:41.960 --> 02:43.871
He used to be Flipper.

02:46.400 --> 02:48.072
Really?

02:48.320 --> 02:50.880
He sure let himself go.

02:56.400 --> 02:57.515
Hi.

02:57.760 --> 03:00.593
Oh, pork rinds.

03:00.840 --> 03:03.991
These will put your father
in a romantic mood.

03:05.160 --> 03:06.912
Come on, Kelly, let's get out of here.

03:07.160 --> 03:09.469
I don't want you to lose
your appetite.

03:11.120 --> 03:12.758
Hi, Peggy.

03:15.880 --> 03:17.359
Here are the CDs you wanted.

03:17.600 --> 03:19.591
I recommend Kenny G.

03:19.840 --> 03:23.549
It really hits the spot,
if you know what I mean.

03:23.800 --> 03:27.076
Well, that's good,
because Al never does.

03:38.960 --> 03:44.080
Well, Al. Who knew you could look
almost human?

03:44.320 --> 03:46.754
There's a lot of things
you don't know, Marcy.

03:47.000 --> 03:50.595
Like how to satisfy a man
without leaving the room.

03:52.080 --> 03:56.119
Oh, Al, I can't believe
you got all dressed up.

03:56.320 --> 03:59.357
Well, sure, Peg. I'm going to be
a judge at the Jiggly Room.

03:59.600 --> 04:02.956
Future Hooters of America
are in my hands.

04:03.200 --> 04:05.998
Well, I thought we agreed
to have a romantic evening.

04:06.200 --> 04:07.189
Well, sure we did, Peg.

04:07.400 --> 04:10.039
But I don't remember
the word "together" mentioned.

04:11.360 --> 04:13.954
Al, I want to have sex.

04:14.200 --> 04:16.190
That's what I'm talking about.
Sex.

04:16.399 --> 04:19.790
But, Peg, in the state of lllinois,
that's illegal.

04:20.519 --> 04:22.158
No, it's not. We're married.

04:22.400 --> 04:25.915
But you still need
two consenting adults.

04:27.200 --> 04:29.589
I'm going to make a great judge.

04:32.480 --> 04:36.871
Peggy, I can't believe
you let Al treat you this way.

04:37.120 --> 04:38.951
And where's Jefferson tonight?

04:39.160 --> 04:41.151
Well, he's judging too.

04:41.400 --> 04:44.790
But I had him meet me
in chambers first.

04:46.240 --> 04:49.471
Oh, gosh. I just feel so lonely.

04:49.720 --> 04:52.598
It's been so long
since someone touched me.

04:54.040 --> 04:57.271
Poor Peggy. I'm so sorry.

05:04.240 --> 05:09.314
You know, Marcy,
that boyish cut really becomes you.

05:14.480 --> 05:18.712
Well, Peggy, there must be something
you can do. With Al.

05:18.920 --> 05:20.672
Oh, he doesn't care about me.

05:20.920 --> 05:24.071
All he cares about are those stupid
strippers down at the Jiggly Room.

05:24.280 --> 05:26.840
That's because
they're anonymous objects.

05:27.080 --> 05:28.433
Men like mystery.

05:28.680 --> 05:30.318
They like fantasy.

05:30.560 --> 05:33.632
They like hiney-shaking hussies
with more plastic in them...

05:33.840 --> 05:36.229
...than a Coca-Cola bottling plant.

05:39.560 --> 05:42.791
- Wives just can't compete.
- I know.

05:43.040 --> 05:46.749
Husbands like to see us as maids
and dishwashers and-

05:47.000 --> 05:49.833
What do you call those people
who cook?

05:51.440 --> 05:53.908
- Cooks?
- Yeah, them.

05:54.160 --> 05:55.639
You know what I'm gonna do?

05:55.880 --> 05:57.950
I'm gonna get out of
these frumpy clothes...

05:58.200 --> 05:59.758
...go down to that Jiggly Room...

06:00.000 --> 06:02.833
...and prove to Al that I am
just as trampy...

06:03.040 --> 06:05.395
...as any of those strippers.

06:08.040 --> 06:10.031
Even trampier.

06:10.400 --> 06:13.392
But wait. Won't Al recognise you?

06:13.640 --> 06:15.756
I'll wear a veil.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.912
Imagine, me as a stripper.

06:19.160 --> 06:23.278
Well, I guess my guidance counsellor
was right after all.

06:25.160 --> 06:28.914
Gentlemen, minors,
lady golfers...

06:29.160 --> 06:33.517
...welcome to Hooter Search '97.

06:37.560 --> 06:40.916
I'm your host, Iqbal.

06:41.160 --> 06:46.393
And now a man
whose selfless devotion to nudity...

06:46.640 --> 06:49.200
...is an inspiration to us all.

06:49.440 --> 06:50.395
Al Bundy.

06:56.280 --> 06:57.998
Thank you.

06:58.240 --> 07:01.516
<i>Tonight's contestants will be judged
by two categories:</i>

07:01.760 --> 07:04.479
The left one and the right one.

07:05.600 --> 07:09.388
And in the event of a tie,
the winner will be decided...

07:09.600 --> 07:12.956
...by peanut butter wrestling.

07:13.160 --> 07:15.151
Oh, there will be a tie...

07:15.400 --> 07:17.834
...and Griff's got the Jif.

07:19.960 --> 07:23.589
The votes will be tabulated
by Ike and Bob Rooney...

07:23.800 --> 07:28.191
...from the accounting firm
Ike and Bob Rooney.

07:30.200 --> 07:32.919
Please take your hands
out of your pants...

07:33.120 --> 07:37.875
...for Chesty LaRue.

07:52.960 --> 07:55.918
Don't worry, men,
I haven't lost a step.

07:56.120 --> 08:00.511
I'm as sexy as I was
when I entertained the troops.

08:01.200 --> 08:03.555
Union or Confederate?

08:06.840 --> 08:09.912
Oh, Lord, I think I'm blind.

08:10.840 --> 08:13.718
Well, you're one of the lucky ones.

08:14.560 --> 08:18.075
I used to do this number for FDR.

08:18.320 --> 08:21.676
He invented the lap dance,
you know.

08:29.520 --> 08:32.477
Oh, the humanity.

08:57.800 --> 09:01.270
Who would have ever thought
of putting taps there?

09:01.520 --> 09:02.919
I think we have a winner.

09:03.120 --> 09:05.111
Chesty.

09:06.960 --> 09:09.633
Wait just a curry-picking minute.

09:09.880 --> 09:12.075
We have a late entry.

09:12.320 --> 09:15.118
The Belle of Beirut, Jasmine.

09:29.880 --> 09:32.872
Where have you been all my life?

09:33.360 --> 09:36.079
She is one gorgeous stripper.

09:36.280 --> 09:37.952
She's not a stripper.

09:38.200 --> 09:42.432
She's an angel who slid down
from heaven on a brass pole.

09:48.400 --> 09:51.472
Ladies and gentlemen,
we have a winner.

09:51.720 --> 09:54.951
I'm not ashamed to admit
that it's my personal favourite.

09:55.200 --> 09:56.474
Jasmine.

10:05.000 --> 10:07.958
I want to show you something.

10:08.520 --> 10:10.511
And I want to see it.

10:11.200 --> 10:13.395
But I need to get home to my wife.

10:18.720 --> 10:20.039
Damn.

10:20.280 --> 10:22.714
You only gained four pounds.

10:22.960 --> 10:25.997
All right. Hurry up and finish this.

10:26.920 --> 10:28.911
I'll get the pork chops
out of the Fry Daddy.

10:29.120 --> 10:30.155
- Come on.
- Come on, Bud.

10:30.400 --> 10:32.994
I have been eating non-stop
for three hours.

10:33.200 --> 10:34.189
I'm stuffed.

10:34.400 --> 10:37.517
Kelly, if you wanna be an artist,
you have to suffer for your craft.

10:37.760 --> 10:39.432
Which reminds me. It's cheese time.

10:39.640 --> 10:42.757
- No, it's not cheese time. No, it's not.
- It's cheese time.

10:43.000 --> 10:44.353
- Eat.
- Hi, kids.

10:44.600 --> 10:45.999
Bye, kids.

10:46.240 --> 10:49.232
Okay. Now that we're done
with the cheese course...

10:49.600 --> 10:52.910
- ... let's have some dessert.
- Oh, okay.

10:54.520 --> 10:55.794
Oh, my God.

10:56.040 --> 10:58.918
This is the worst vanilla ice cream
I've ever had.

10:59.120 --> 11:00.712
That's not ice cream. It's...

11:00.960 --> 11:02.279
...Crisco.

11:04.960 --> 11:06.518
No, Kelly. Don't run.

11:06.720 --> 11:07.869
You're burning calories.

11:08.080 --> 11:10.469
Hi, Bud.
Bye, Bud.

11:13.600 --> 11:15.352
Oh, hi, Al.

11:15.600 --> 11:16.669
No talking. Turned on.

11:16.880 --> 11:18.598
Need you. Now.

11:23.960 --> 11:26.633
That was the best night since...

11:26.880 --> 11:28.598
...ever.

11:31.840 --> 11:34.912
There's plenty more
where that came from, babe.

11:39.680 --> 11:41.352
Peg.

11:45.720 --> 11:49.315
- Oh, Peggy, I am so proud of you.
- You should be.

11:49.520 --> 11:54.071
I raked in $240 in tips last night.

11:54.320 --> 11:57.437
Not to mention a watch.

11:58.720 --> 12:01.393
Someone put a watch
down your G-string?

12:01.640 --> 12:02.755
That's appalling.

12:02.960 --> 12:05.394
Actually, it's a Timex.

12:06.560 --> 12:11.270
Anyway, I meant you have
struck a blow for wives everywhere.

12:11.480 --> 12:12.913
Now, tell me. What did Al say...

12:13.120 --> 12:14.951
...when you showed him
you were Jasmine?

12:15.160 --> 12:16.957
Actually, I didn't.

12:17.200 --> 12:19.350
- What?
- Well, I was going to.

12:19.600 --> 12:23.798
But then he just jumped on me
like a human Weenie Tot.

12:24.680 --> 12:27.831
It was so romantic.

12:28.040 --> 12:31.112
Peggy, now you're not any better
than those cheap strippers.

12:31.360 --> 12:32.793
Well, yes, I am.

12:33.000 --> 12:35.639
I won that contest.

12:37.000 --> 12:40.879
No. I mean you have set
the women's movement back 50 years.

12:41.080 --> 12:42.035
Who cares?

12:42.240 --> 12:46.711
Last night this woman's movement
was fantastic.

12:47.960 --> 12:51.714
Peggy, last night Al
was not making love with you.

12:51.960 --> 12:54.599
In his head, he was
making love with some slut.

12:54.800 --> 12:57.553
That's what he always does.

12:58.160 --> 13:01.948
But, you see,
this time the slut was me.

13:02.200 --> 13:05.670
And that makes me feel very good
about myself.

13:06.880 --> 13:08.836
So now you're going
to be a stripper?

13:09.040 --> 13:12.032
Actually, we call it exotic dancing.

13:12.320 --> 13:14.356
It's an art form.

13:14.600 --> 13:15.999
Now, if you'll excuse me.

13:16.200 --> 13:19.590
I have to go upstairs
and die my boobs for Easter.

13:21.680 --> 13:23.352
Peg. Turned on again.

13:23.560 --> 13:25.551
Need you. Now.

13:25.800 --> 13:27.392
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

13:27.600 --> 13:29.909
Daddy's home from the nudie bar-

13:30.160 --> 13:31.752
Oh, hi, Al.

13:32.000 --> 13:33.672
Peg, where have you been?

13:33.880 --> 13:38.192
Well, I was just over at Marcy's,
borrowing a raincoat.

13:38.400 --> 13:40.994
- No talking now, Peg. Clothes off.
- Oh, no, no, no.

13:41.200 --> 13:43.236
Don't you want
to brush your teeth first?

13:43.440 --> 13:45.317
Before sex?

13:45.560 --> 13:46.879
Just for me.

13:47.120 --> 13:49.759
Oh, all right, Peg.

13:50.880 --> 13:52.472
Hey, Peg?

13:52.840 --> 13:54.876
I can't find my toothbrush.

13:55.120 --> 13:57.429
Well, just gargle.

13:57.640 --> 13:59.471
All right.

14:06.880 --> 14:10.714
Peg, that blue stuff tastes awful.

14:10.960 --> 14:13.315
Honey, the red stuff is gargle.

14:13.560 --> 14:17.269
The blue stuff is Tidy Bowl.

14:25.360 --> 14:28.477
<i>Oh, no. My veil.</i>

14:28.680 --> 14:30.432
<i>Oh, no. Jasmine's veil.</i>

14:30.680 --> 14:33.114
<i>It must have dropped
out of my pock et.</i>

14:33.320 --> 14:34.435
<i>I better distract him.</i>

14:35.000 --> 14:37.116
<i>I better distract her.</i>

14:46.760 --> 14:50.230
<i>- I know. I'll turn the lights off.
- I know. I'll turn the lights off.</i>

14:50.480 --> 14:52.516
- Good idea.
- Good idea.

14:57.240 --> 14:58.798
Oh, Al.

14:59.040 --> 15:00.632
Oh, Peg.

15:00.880 --> 15:02.552
Oh, Al.

15:02.800 --> 15:04.870
Oh, Jasmine.

15:06.880 --> 15:08.029
What?

15:08.240 --> 15:11.437
<i>Oh, God. I called her Jasmine.
She's going to kill me.</i>

15:12.400 --> 15:15.631
<i>I better do that thing she lik es.</i>

15:16.320 --> 15:18.880
<i>He called me Jasmine.</i>

15:20.360 --> 15:22.669
<i>I'm gonna kill him.</i>

15:25.080 --> 15:29.232
<i>He's doing that thing I lik e.</i>

15:30.680 --> 15:34.514
You mean Al actually
called out Jasmine's name in bed?

15:34.760 --> 15:35.988
Can you believe it?

15:36.240 --> 15:38.879
This is really not turning out
the way I'd hoped it would.

15:39.080 --> 15:41.116
Who'd have thought tricking
your husband...

15:41.320 --> 15:45.552
...into falling in love with a stripper
would be bad for your marriage?

15:45.760 --> 15:47.910
You think Al's falling in love
with her?

15:48.120 --> 15:51.430
Yup. Better watch out
or they might run away together.

15:52.000 --> 15:54.753
Over my dead body.

15:55.000 --> 15:56.149
Oh, my God.

15:56.360 --> 15:59.670
That bitch Jasmine
is ruining my marriage.

16:00.040 --> 16:02.838
Peggy, that bitch is you.

16:03.040 --> 16:04.155
Well, I know that.

16:04.360 --> 16:05.793
I've created a monster.

16:06.040 --> 16:09.191
Although, she does make
300 bucks a night.

16:09.400 --> 16:10.992
So are you gonna stop stripping?

16:11.200 --> 16:13.430
I can't just stop stripping.

16:13.640 --> 16:17.269
If Jasmine just disappears,
Al will never get her out of his head.

16:17.520 --> 16:21.149
No, I've got to destroy
the mystique of Jasmine.

16:21.400 --> 16:23.231
Plus, one more night of this...

16:23.440 --> 16:26.557
...I can buy this really cute
pair of boots.

16:28.680 --> 16:30.830
Bud, I am going to kill you...

16:31.080 --> 16:34.595
...and then I'm going
to bury you alive.

16:36.960 --> 16:39.394
Kelly, it's not my fault
they fired you.

16:39.640 --> 16:42.313
How was I supposed to know
you wouldn't gain weight evenly?

16:42.520 --> 16:44.397
Well, if you would have let me
stand up...

16:44.600 --> 16:46.750
...it wouldn't have all gone
to my butt.

16:54.480 --> 16:55.959
Your butt's not that big.

16:56.200 --> 16:57.474
It is so.

16:57.720 --> 16:59.711
I went to the grocery store,
I turned around.

16:59.920 --> 17:02.992
I knocked over the
entire Pringles pyramid.

17:03.880 --> 17:05.472
My career is over.

17:05.720 --> 17:07.199
I wish I was dead.

17:07.680 --> 17:10.637
So does that squirrel
you sat on at the park.

17:11.839 --> 17:13.068
I didn't see him.

17:13.319 --> 17:16.675
You were fighting him for nuts.

17:20.119 --> 17:23.589
Well, my blood sugar was low.
I almost fainted.

17:23.800 --> 17:25.836
That would be disastrous
for those toddlers...

17:26.040 --> 17:28.156
...who tried to hide under you
for shade.

17:29.320 --> 17:30.435
They were so mean.

17:30.680 --> 17:33.069
They called me a Weeble.

17:34.480 --> 17:36.630
Kelly, I hate to be critical.

17:36.880 --> 17:40.759
But if you'd cut out the snacking,
you might feel better about yourself.

17:41.080 --> 17:44.197
You are so dead.

17:45.400 --> 17:46.799
Come on.

17:47.040 --> 17:49.554
You can't even get up.

17:50.240 --> 17:52.037
Kelly. Kelly. Kelly.

17:52.280 --> 17:53.952
Look, there's someone
chasing you too.

17:54.160 --> 17:56.754
Oh, that's just your ass.

18:00.160 --> 18:04.199
Cheer up, Kel. Now, you people
are supposed to be jolly.

18:07.040 --> 18:09.600
Help! Help!

18:09.840 --> 18:12.798
You know, I think
you still got the moves.

18:16.080 --> 18:19.709
Too bad some of them
are involuntary.

18:22.800 --> 18:24.472
Hey, cutie.

18:24.720 --> 18:28.872
Once you go grey, you'll never stray.

18:31.280 --> 18:33.077
Al, where did you get
all that money?

18:33.320 --> 18:34.514
From Peg's dresser.

18:34.760 --> 18:37.752
Suddenly she's got all kinds
of spare cash lying around.

18:38.000 --> 18:39.479
Oh, boy.

18:41.360 --> 18:43.032
Oh, yeah.

18:47.240 --> 18:50.835
Here she comes,
like a beautiful mirage.

18:59.120 --> 19:03.989
I bet you'd like to take a ride
on her magic carpet.

19:05.480 --> 19:10.156
I think Jasmine has a little crush
on Aladdin here.

19:11.360 --> 19:13.874
Shut up, both of you.
You're being very immature.

19:15.080 --> 19:17.150
I think I just saw her bellybutton.

19:17.400 --> 19:21.029
You know, Al, you two make
a cute couple.

19:21.240 --> 19:23.231
No, no, she's out of my league.

19:23.480 --> 19:25.948
The worst part is she probably lives
with some loser...

19:26.160 --> 19:27.798
...who doesn't appreciate her.

19:29.000 --> 19:32.993
I'll tell you. If I had a woman like that,
I would never leave home.

19:37.920 --> 19:41.833
- You're moving now.
- Go, baby. Go, baby.

19:43.280 --> 19:47.068
You know, you're much prettier
than the cartoon Jasmine.

19:48.520 --> 19:49.475
Don't look.

19:49.720 --> 19:53.554
You'll see it all very soon.

20:00.320 --> 20:02.515
Can you see it all, boys?

20:03.280 --> 20:05.555
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, yeah.

20:10.000 --> 20:13.356
I don't want to tell you
that I don't enjoy that a lot...

20:13.560 --> 20:17.997
...but I think you ought to know
that I'm a married man.

20:18.240 --> 20:19.639
Well, I don't care.

20:19.880 --> 20:21.916
Neither do I.

20:25.640 --> 20:28.712
You know, Jasmine,
I'd like to tell you...

20:28.960 --> 20:31.633
...that I want you to tie up
the rest of my body and all...

20:31.840 --> 20:35.037
...but I really gotta go
see my wife now.

20:35.280 --> 20:37.236
What do you want
to see me about, Al?

20:41.840 --> 20:43.159
What did you do with Jasmine?

20:43.360 --> 20:47.433
- I didn't do anything with her.
- You killed her, didn't you, Peg?

20:47.640 --> 20:50.074
Because you couldn't stand
to see me happy.

20:50.280 --> 20:52.999
I am Jasmine, you idiot.

20:53.200 --> 20:54.519
You can't be Jasmine.

20:54.720 --> 20:57.314
Jasmine's a beautiful,
alluring woman.

20:57.520 --> 21:01.354
While you're- You're just a wife.

21:01.560 --> 21:02.709
That's right, Al.

21:02.960 --> 21:07.033
And now your wife and your fantasy
are one and the same.

21:07.280 --> 21:11.512
So now every time you have sex,
you'll think about me.

21:12.600 --> 21:14.318
No!

21:29.240 --> 21:30.309
Hey, Al.

21:30.520 --> 21:34.069
- You want to fool around?
- Oh, all right, Peg.

21:34.760 --> 21:36.113
Could you get the veil?

21:36.320 --> 21:38.311
Oh, sure, honey.
