to say something

11:38.950 --> 11:40.700

11:40.740 --> 11:41.910

all that upsetting energy.

See you.

12:10.290 --> 12:12.340
So has he read
the whole book?

12:13.730 --> 12:15.160
I don't think so.

12:15.210 --> 12:17.510
So he don't
know that Darla
in there, too.

12:20.080 --> 12:21.650
That chapter
broke me down.

12:21.690 --> 12:24.260
Why would Nova
put all that in there?

12:24.300 --> 12:28.310
The-- The night that
I found Darla and Blue

12:28.350 --> 12:30.790
when Rah was locked up,

12:30.830 --> 12:32.790
that's a story that
should never be told.

12:32.830 --> 12:37.010
I cannot believe
that Nova would do that
to all of us.

You gonna tell him?

12:41.450 --> 12:43.240
No.

Because that book
will never see
the light of day.

tonight an hour later?

22:08.190 --> 22:11.800
Ha ha. Well, let me
try these ribs
in a to-go plate.

22:13.720 --> 22:15.200
Ooh.

22:17.070 --> 22:20.030
Mmm! You know what?

22:20.810 --> 22:22.250
I think,
in another life,

22:22.290 --> 22:24.210
you probably were
somebody's grandma.

22:24.250 --> 22:27.300
You sure you ain't
out here trying to cook
like you 50 years old?

22:27.340 --> 22:29.870
I'm gonna have to see
some I.D., young lady.

22:29.910 --> 22:32.780
I always like to support
local businesses.

22:32.820 --> 22:34.830
You know, uh, I grew up

22:34.870 --> 22:37.000
hanging on
my mama's apron strings
in her restaurant.

22:37.050 --> 22:40.310
Matter of fact,
I'm on my way
to Louisiana

22:40.350 --> 22:42.310
to see somebody
I used to know,

22:42.360 --> 22:44.400
recently opened up
they own restaurant.

22:44.450 --> 22:45.790
Well, maybe that
could be you someday.

22:45.840 --> 22:47.010
That's the goal.

22:47.060 --> 22:48.670
And thank you
for that.

22:48.710 --> 22:51.800
Be sure and tell
all your friends
to come through.

22:51.840 --> 22:53.370
Oh, I'll do that.

23:05.770 --> 23:08.430
-[chairs humming]
-[both sighing]

23:08.470 --> 23:10.910
That feels good.

23:12.600 --> 23:14.560
I never had
no massage before.

23:14.610 --> 23:16.430
Never?

23:16.480 --> 23:17.610
No.

23:17.650 --> 23:19.700
Oh, you are missing out

23:19.740 --> 23:22.270
on one of life's
great simple pleasures.

23:22.310 --> 23:24.010
Ahh.

23:24.050 --> 23:26.570
-[laughs]
-Guess so.

23:26.620 --> 23:27.750
Relax.

23:27.790 --> 23:30.450
Just let it do
what it does.

23:30.490 --> 23:31.880
I am relaxed.

23:31.930 --> 23:33.580
Oh, my God.
If this is you relaxed,

23:33.620 --> 23:35.580
I'd hate to see you tense.

23:36.710 --> 23:39.410
Look, close your eyes.
Feel the rhythm.

23:39.460 --> 23:41.460
[laughs]

23:41.500 --> 23:43.330
A'ight.

23:43.370 --> 23:45.240
Give in to it.

23:49.030 --> 23:51.340
Glad I ran into you.

23:51.380 --> 23:52.380
Yeah?

23:56.600 --> 23:59.480
So you think
we could do this again?

23:59.520 --> 24:00.610
This?

24:00.650 --> 24:03.480
I'm talking
about you and me.

24:03.520 --> 24:05.530
No kids. Just us.

24:05.570 --> 24:07.440
I'd like that.

24:09.530 --> 24:11.050
[sighs]

24:11.100 --> 24:13.230
A bit bitter,
that one.

24:13.270 --> 24:15.230
Really?

24:15.270 --> 24:17.410
I mean, unless
you like some bite
with your coffee.

24:17.450 --> 24:19.800
I just like coffee,
period.

24:19.840 --> 24:21.630
It's my saving grace.

24:21.670 --> 24:23.330
When I first got sober,

24:23.370 --> 24:25.420
I'd have injected
caffeine in my arm
if I could.

24:25.460 --> 24:27.070
[laughs]

24:27.900 --> 24:29.200
Too much?

24:29.250 --> 24:30.590
No, not at all.

24:30.640 --> 24:33.290
Uh, it's actually--

24:33.340 --> 24:37.560
It's a relief to be able
to joke about it, you know?

24:37.600 --> 24:40.520
Laughing is not a crime,
people.

24:40.560 --> 24:43.260
Yeah, an AA group
can get pretty serious
sometimes,

24:43.300 --> 24:46.260
but everybody's
got their process.

24:46.310 --> 24:49.740
I mean, God,
six months ago,

24:49.790 --> 24:51.490
I don't think
I could have laughed

24:51.530 --> 24:52.490
about much of anything.

24:55.400 --> 25:00.670
Sorry. We said no group talk
on our first date.

25:00.710 --> 25:02.800
I know, but who
are we fooling?

25:02.840 --> 25:05.320
-True.
-Hey, have you, uh--

25:05.370 --> 25:07.890
you given
any more thought
to being a sponsor?

25:07.940 --> 25:10.460
I haven't decided yet.

25:10.500 --> 25:14.460
I think anyone would
be lucky to have you
as a sponsor.

25:14.510 --> 25:16.120
You been
through the fire,

25:16.160 --> 25:18.560
and you still here.

25:18.600 --> 25:20.120
Can even
smile sometimes.

25:20.170 --> 25:22.470
[both chuckle]

25:22.520 --> 25:23.690
Thank you...

25:24.690 --> 25:25.820
for that.

25:27.520 --> 25:31.700
I-I feel like I, um--

25:31.740 --> 25:34.620
like I've just gotten
to a good place.

25:34.660 --> 25:35.960
Yeah.

25:36.010 --> 25:39.140
I been sober
five years now,

25:39.180 --> 25:43.970
and, uh, took me
twice as long to get
to where you are.

25:46.150 --> 25:50.240
But-- But we ain't
gotta talk about
all that right now,

25:50.280 --> 25:52.460
'cause now
I think it's time

25:52.500 --> 25:54.550
to get into this
Italian dark roast.

25:57.680 --> 26:00.030
Mm. [coughs]

26:00.080 --> 26:01.030
It's just right.

26:01.080 --> 26:03.170
[both laugh]

26:04.560 --> 26:05.600
Bye, Miss Violet.

26:05.650 --> 26:06.600
Night, y'all.

26:06.650 --> 26:08.430
[entry bell rings]

26:08.470 --> 26:10.740
You and the kids were
talking about nothing, huh?

26:11.610 --> 26:12.650
[manuscript plops]

26:13.650 --> 26:15.050
Just found "nothing"

26:15.090 --> 26:17.610
stuffed on a shelf
in my office.

26:19.180 --> 26:22.620
You said
you ain't have time
to read Nova's book.

26:22.660 --> 26:26.620
So you took it upon yourself
to read it for me,

26:26.670 --> 26:28.840
and I take it
that that child

26:28.890 --> 26:32.590
done dug up every one
of Ernest's skeletons.

26:36.760 --> 26:39.240
Oh, this book
ain't just about Ernest.

26:41.600 --> 26:45.990
Vi, I think
it's time for you
to read that book.

26:55.350 --> 26:57.440
[cell phone buzzing]

27:00.740 --> 27:01.750
Third time tonight.

27:01.790 --> 27:04.490
[buzzing continues]

27:04.530 --> 27:06.840
It's always been like this,

27:06.880 --> 27:08.710
always on her schedule.

27:08.750 --> 27:13.320
"Consequence" is not
a word in her vocabulary,
apparently.

27:14.760 --> 27:15.850
Sorry.

27:15.890 --> 27:17.590
I'm just venting.

27:18.500 --> 27:20.020
It's okay.

27:20.070 --> 27:22.850
If someone wrote
all the things
I did in a book,

27:22.900 --> 27:25.600
I don't think I'd
be handing it out
to everyone I meet.

27:25.640 --> 27:26.810
Hmm.

27:26.860 --> 27:29.160
-Sounds ominous.
-[chuckles]

27:29.210 --> 27:31.510
Is there something
from your past I
should know about?

27:31.560 --> 27:34.080
No. No, I-I just...

27:35.340 --> 27:37.300
I just mean that there
were a lot of causes

27:37.350 --> 27:38.700
that I was
passionate about,

27:38.740 --> 27:42.960
and sometimes my passion
didn't always help.

27:44.270 --> 27:45.700
There are
just some things

27:45.750 --> 27:46.920
that I wish
I would have

27:46.960 --> 27:48.880
-thought through more.
-Mm.

27:48.920 --> 27:51.710
Well, I spent the better part
of the last two years

27:51.750 --> 27:54.970
moving on from the things
she wrote about.

27:56.450 --> 27:58.320
When you read it...

27:58.370 --> 27:59.630
I won't read it.

28:01.020 --> 28:03.330
I want to get to know
the you now,

28:03.370 --> 28:05.240
not you then.

28:09.770 --> 28:11.120
Thank you.

28:16.080 --> 28:17.730
All I know is...

28:19.430 --> 28:21.130
I can't have this.

28:21.170 --> 28:22.520
I can't.

28:22.570 --> 28:24.390
Sounds like you
have to talk to her.

28:24.440 --> 28:26.740
Well, she never
talked to me about it,

28:26.790 --> 28:29.010
and now it's in print
for anyone to read.

28:29.050 --> 28:31.230
This is defamation,
maybe even libel.

28:41.240 --> 28:42.540
Was it all a lie?

28:45.150 --> 28:46.980
I know you have
to do something,

28:47.020 --> 28:48.590
but if you go down
the legal road,

28:48.630 --> 28:51.330
it might just
bring more attention
to the book.

28:53.290 --> 28:55.380
[sighs]
This whole thing's a mess.

28:56.690 --> 28:59.690
I'm-- I'm just
trying to fix it.

29:01.080 --> 29:03.350
What if you can't?

29:03.390 --> 29:05.170
What if this is
just one of those things

29:05.220 --> 29:07.310
you have
to live through?

29:09.830 --> 29:11.530
[stereos playing music]

29:11.570 --> 29:15.050
We have so much stuff
to do now you're back.

29:15.100 --> 29:16.790
I'm happy to be here.
I don't know.

29:16.840 --> 29:20.190
Have to go hang out
and watch the game.

29:20.230 --> 29:21.540
-Getting a big turn--
-Yeah--

29:21.580 --> 29:23.710
-Yo, watch it. Watch it.
-Oh, excuse me.

29:23.760 --> 29:26.060
Hey, almost didn't
recognize you there, Micah.

29:28.020 --> 29:30.420
Looks like someone
watched Black Panther
too many times.

29:30.460 --> 29:32.290
[boys laughing]

29:32.330 --> 29:34.120
[boy]
It's so true!

29:34.160 --> 29:35.380
Hey, what did
you say, bro?

29:36.770 --> 29:38.030
No, what'd you say?

29:38.080 --> 29:39.250
[laughter continues]

29:39.290 --> 29:40.770
Oh, so I'm funny
to you now?

29:40.820 --> 29:42.510
[laughs] Yeah, dude.

29:42.560 --> 29:44.820
-[Keke] Whoa.
-Hey, get him! Get him!

29:44.870 --> 29:46.210
Hey, sto--
Micah!

29:46.260 --> 29:47.390
[kids] Fight! Fight!

29:47.430 --> 29:49.480
[Keke]
Micah!

29:49.520 --> 29:51.700
[overlapping chatter, yelling]

29:52.740 --> 29:53.920
[echoing]
Stop!

29:55.400 --> 29:57.490
[insects chirping]

30:18.900 --> 30:19.990
See you soon.

30:20.030 --> 30:23.820
I could see you inside.

30:26.170 --> 30:27.730
I need
to take things slow.

30:29.170 --> 30:30.520
You understand,
right?

30:31.480 --> 30:33.000
I understand...

30:34.780 --> 30:36.260
and I respect that.

30:37.310 --> 30:38.830
See you soon, then.

30:41.700 --> 30:42.840
Real soon, I hope.

30:49.760 --> 30:51.410
[door opens]

30:53.630 --> 30:56.200
He bumped into me
on purpose,

30:56.240 --> 30:58.330
didn't apologize,

30:58.370 --> 31:00.030
makes a joke
about black culture,

31:00.070 --> 31:02.770
and I'm supposed to be
like, "No worries"?

31:02.810 --> 31:04.680
[scoffs]
You know, guys like Beau

31:04.730 --> 31:06.950
grow up to be
men like Orson.

31:07.900 --> 31:10.470
Orson wasn't born that way.

31:10.520 --> 31:12.130
Before he started
abusing us,

31:12.170 --> 31:14.560
he got used
to laughing at us.

31:14.610 --> 31:16.830
That's the first step.

31:16.870 --> 31:18.090
What is?

31:18.130 --> 31:20.530
Ah, I went to one
of those seminars

31:20.570 --> 31:22.530
you told me about
this summer.

31:22.570 --> 31:24.700
Read a lot of Homi Bhabha,
some others,

31:24.750 --> 31:28.790
but I learned that
the first step to taking
a people's stuff,

31:28.840 --> 31:31.620
to taking their land,
their bodies,

31:31.670 --> 31:33.840
is to take down
their culture,

31:33.890 --> 31:35.280
to laugh at it.

31:35.320 --> 31:38.020
Yes, the comic turn.

31:38.070 --> 31:40.330
I remember.

31:40.370 --> 31:41.940
If someone
had popped Orson
in the mouth,

31:41.980 --> 31:44.250
maybe he wouldn't
have put a gun in mine.

31:44.290 --> 31:46.600
You know,
zero tolerance,

31:46.640 --> 31:48.550
that's my new policy.

31:48.600 --> 31:52.040
I want you to be
the first person

31:52.080 --> 31:54.690
to have a hard copy
of my book.

31:57.650 --> 31:59.130
Wow.

32:00.480 --> 32:01.830
Ah, this is an honor.

32:01.870 --> 32:03.310
Can you
sign it for me?

32:03.350 --> 32:05.440
-Already done.
-What?

32:07.620 --> 32:10.660
"For moments of doubt,
remember we have wings.

32:10.710 --> 32:12.930
With love, Aunt Nova."

32:13.880 --> 32:15.150
Thank you.

32:17.840 --> 32:19.320
[laughs]

32:22.590 --> 32:25.070
He was so tired.

32:25.110 --> 32:26.550
[laughs]

32:26.590 --> 32:27.900
Yeah.

32:28.990 --> 32:30.510
What?

32:30.550 --> 32:32.550
Is everything okay?

32:32.600 --> 32:34.900
Just a crazy day.

32:34.950 --> 32:36.430
That's all.

32:36.470 --> 32:39.170
You have a lot
on your shoulders,
Ralph Angel.

32:39.210 --> 32:41.300
You're handling it,
though.

32:41.350 --> 32:43.220
I'm proud of you.

32:43.260 --> 32:44.610
Appreciate it.

32:47.260 --> 32:48.830
How you doing?

32:48.870 --> 32:53.490
I'm-- I'm feeling stable

32:53.530 --> 32:56.320
and hopeful.

32:59.100 --> 33:01.060
Hopeful about this guy
you been seeing?

33:01.100 --> 33:02.410
[clears throat]

33:03.410 --> 33:04.800
Do you think that, uh...

33:04.850 --> 33:08.160
we should, um...

33:08.200 --> 33:10.640
be talking
about these kinds
of things?

33:10.680 --> 33:12.720
I mean, why not?

33:13.810 --> 33:16.550
We co-parents,
ain't we?

33:16.600 --> 33:19.340
They say it's best
we be friends.

33:19.380 --> 33:21.730
I mean, shit,
you already told me
you dating somebody.

33:21.780 --> 33:25.610
I don't think
we should talk
about these things,

33:25.650 --> 33:30.130
because if I tell you
about who I'm dating,

33:30.180 --> 33:34.790
then that means
that I'd have to hear
about who you're dating.

33:38.580 --> 33:40.670
And I don't think
I'm ready for that.

33:43.230 --> 33:45.760
[sighs]

33:47.320 --> 33:48.720
Be honest...

33:51.420 --> 33:53.640
I don't think
I'm ready, either.

33:53.680 --> 33:56.460
But I wish you
happiness, Darla.

33:57.730 --> 33:59.420
That, I do.

34:00.470 --> 34:02.040
As I do you.

34:05.430 --> 34:06.910
[chuckles]

34:09.520 --> 34:10.830
[Charley]
Micah.

34:12.090 --> 34:14.480
[sighs]

34:18.050 --> 34:19.920
-Oh, Micah.
-I'm fine.

34:19.970 --> 34:21.530
It's not a big deal.

34:21.580 --> 34:25.620
Mm-mmm. That is not
necessarily for you
to decide.

34:25.670 --> 34:27.410
You can't be getting
into fights, Micah.

34:27.450 --> 34:29.110
You-- You cannot.

34:29.150 --> 34:34.200
How you act and
how you look matter.

34:34.240 --> 34:36.240
Why didn't you tell me
you were gonna
loc your hair?

34:36.290 --> 34:38.510
You didn't say
anything about
my hair last year.

34:38.550 --> 34:42.120
A high-top fade
reads differently
to most people.

34:42.160 --> 34:44.690
And by most people,
you mean white people?

34:44.730 --> 34:48.430
I should live my life
by making white people
feel comfortable?

34:48.470 --> 34:50.130
If wearing a belt
on your pants

34:50.170 --> 34:52.740
or cutting your hair
is a millisecond difference

34:52.780 --> 34:54.780
between you being
dead or alive,

34:54.830 --> 34:57.440
th-that's a compromise
I'm willing to live with.

34:57.480 --> 34:59.140
I'm not.

34:59.180 --> 35:00.700
I'm gonna twist
myself into knots

35:00.750 --> 35:02.140
trying to fit
into some box

35:02.180 --> 35:04.750
that doesn't promise me
a damn thing.

35:04.790 --> 35:06.060
No, I'm gonna do me.

35:08.320 --> 35:11.060
Sounds like
you learned a lot
in your chat with Nova.

35:11.100 --> 35:14.850
[scoffs] This
has nothing to do
with Aunt Nova.

35:14.890 --> 35:17.330
You know,
the night I was in jail,

35:17.370 --> 35:19.200
after I got out,
you know who it was

35:19.240 --> 35:22.810
who saw that
I had pissed my pants
because I was so scared,

35:22.850 --> 35:26.730
tied her sweater
around my waist so
I wouldn't be ashamed?

35:26.770 --> 35:29.730
Who wasn't
across the parking lot
screaming at Dad?

35:29.770 --> 35:32.430
Who gave
a damn that night
about how I felt?

35:33.780 --> 35:34.870
Aunt Nova.

35:36.780 --> 35:38.480
Now, good night.

35:43.920 --> 35:45.700
[pounding on door]

35:52.410 --> 35:54.450
All right,
now I'm ready for you.

35:54.500 --> 35:56.630
Okay. Let's just
sit down and tal--

35:56.670 --> 35:57.670
No.

35:59.200 --> 36:00.630
It was bad enough for you

36:00.680 --> 36:02.810
to print this trash
for the world to see,

36:02.850 --> 36:06.290
but now your words
have wormed their way
into my son's heart

36:06.330 --> 36:08.290
and poisoned him against me.

36:08.340 --> 36:09.950
Charley, please.
Micah came to me.

36:09.990 --> 36:11.380
-He knew you'd be upset.
-Mm.

36:11.430 --> 36:13.120
He just needed someone
to listen to him,

36:13.170 --> 36:15.170
and you always--
[sighs]

36:16.650 --> 36:18.210
No, keep going.

36:18.260 --> 36:19.260
I always what?

36:20.740 --> 36:23.000
You certainly didn't
hold back in your book.

36:24.050 --> 36:26.570
What do you
think about me, Nova?

36:26.610 --> 36:30.620
Actually,
I already have an idea.

36:34.710 --> 36:38.100
"My sister,
born to privilege,

36:38.150 --> 36:42.590
raised with wealth,
and half-bathed
in whiteness,

36:42.630 --> 36:46.200
used her light skin
as her shield and her sword,

36:46.240 --> 36:49.380
weapons in every room
she entered,

36:49.420 --> 36:54.080
every deal she made,
with every women
she sacrificed,

36:54.120 --> 36:56.510
and for every man
she protected.

36:56.560 --> 36:58.690
Her honey skin
kept her safe,

36:58.730 --> 37:00.910
all the while
keeping her complicit

37:00.950 --> 37:05.170
in the continued
oppression of
black bodies."

37:13.310 --> 37:15.970
Is this what
you think of me?

37:16.010 --> 37:17.750
I was writing
about privilege.

37:17.800 --> 37:20.540
You can shove
your themes
up your pretentious ass.

37:20.580 --> 37:22.500
Call it what you want,
but this,

37:22.540 --> 37:24.890
this is 300 pages
of you telling the world

37:24.930 --> 37:27.540
how much you hate
your only sister!

37:27.590 --> 37:29.240
Charley,
I love you.

37:29.290 --> 37:31.200
This isn't love!

37:31.240 --> 37:34.330
This is betrayal
disguised as pulp fiction,

37:34.380 --> 37:36.550
trying to pass itself off
as literature!

37:36.600 --> 37:38.820
Almost everything
in the book was
public knowledge.

37:38.860 --> 37:40.210
Oh, my God.

37:40.250 --> 37:41.910
So I wasn't
writing about Davis

37:41.950 --> 37:43.340
to be salacious.

37:43.390 --> 37:45.560
You and Davis
present a classic story

37:45.610 --> 37:47.870
about the insidious
nature of rape culture.

37:47.910 --> 37:51.350
Are you out
of your damn mind?!

37:51.390 --> 37:55.400
Nova, we are people.
I am your sister.

37:55.440 --> 37:57.620
I am not some example
to be used

37:57.660 --> 38:00.010
for your examination
of rape culture.

38:00.060 --> 38:02.190
I'm writing
about how women
often protect men

38:02.230 --> 38:05.060
instead of protecting
other women,

38:05.100 --> 38:07.280
which is what
you did, Charley.

38:07.320 --> 38:11.410
And how we are blind
to our own enabling
of patriarchy.

38:11.460 --> 38:13.590
You're hardly
alone in this.

38:13.630 --> 38:15.330
That's what
I'm writing about.

38:15.380 --> 38:17.730
Dress it up
however you want,

38:17.770 --> 38:20.030
but, at the end of the day,

38:20.080 --> 38:23.600
you wrote about your evil,
light-skinned sister

38:23.640 --> 38:25.990
and her famous,
philandering husband.

38:26.040 --> 38:28.390
I'm laying myself bare
in the book, too.

38:28.430 --> 38:31.170
I admit what happened
to Too Sweet
was my fault.

38:31.220 --> 38:33.350
I sold weed to Rid
when it was illegal,

38:33.390 --> 38:36.350
and Too Sweet
bore the burden
of my callous actions.

38:36.400 --> 38:37.610
I have been complicit

38:37.660 --> 38:39.440
in a system that hurts
young black men.

38:39.490 --> 38:41.140
Laying yourself bare

38:41.180 --> 38:42.710
and laying
your family bare

38:42.750 --> 38:44.970
are two
different things.

38:45.010 --> 38:48.410
You wrote
about me, Rah.

38:48.450 --> 38:50.060
Nova, you wrote
about Aunt Vi.

38:50.110 --> 38:52.370
I'm writing about
an American family.

38:52.410 --> 38:54.110
Oh, when Micah
reads this...

39:00.900 --> 39:02.380
He trusts you.

39:04.860 --> 39:06.340
When he reads this...

39:08.210 --> 39:10.040
he'll believe
I'm a monster.

39:10.080 --> 39:11.340
He won't.

39:11.390 --> 39:13.000
I'll explain it
to him.

39:13.040 --> 39:16.480
You have no idea
what the consequences

39:16.520 --> 39:19.090
of this being
in the world will be.

39:20.270 --> 39:22.750
You have to put
the brakes on it.

39:24.270 --> 39:25.920
I can't, Charley.

39:26.840 --> 39:28.360
It's gone to print.

39:28.400 --> 39:30.010
It's too late.
