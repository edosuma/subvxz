00:45.392 --> 00:48.835
So this is intended to wash
your dishes for you, sir?

00:48.862 --> 00:52.978
Yes, well, that pushes
streams of soapy water at them.

00:53.326 --> 00:56.646
This is the motor for the dish closet.

00:56.837 --> 00:59.128
Exactly how many
dishes do you have, sir?

00:59.351 --> 01:01.749
Well, Julia has taken it upon herself

01:01.795 --> 01:03.737
to purchase two new sets of tableware.

01:03.758 --> 01:06.218
She plans on entertaining
quite a bit at the new house.

01:06.254 --> 01:08.462
Well, I look forward
to my next invitation.

01:08.477 --> 01:11.275
Detective Murdoch! I
must speak with you!

01:11.489 --> 01:14.721
- Excuse me, sir...
- This is a matter of great importance!

01:14.742 --> 01:17.718
I have travelled all
the way from Naples.

01:17.843 --> 01:20.588
My name is Flavio Pupazzi.

01:20.602 --> 01:22.923
I'm a detective, like you.

01:23.512 --> 01:26.995
Was there not just some sort
of volcanic eruption in Naples?

01:27.120 --> 01:29.412
Yes.

01:29.478 --> 01:34.173
Vesuvius has killed
hundreds. My city is in ruins.

01:34.298 --> 01:35.838
What can we do for you?

01:35.853 --> 01:39.152
I followed a man here
from Italy, a Canadian.

01:39.198 --> 01:41.725
This man is a criminal.

01:41.759 --> 01:44.760
He has no... how you say? Morality.

01:44.774 --> 01:47.835
Who is this man, and what crimes
is he supposed to have committed?

01:47.960 --> 01:49.771
His name...

01:49.896 --> 01:52.432
is Matthew Honeyman.

01:52.879 --> 01:55.104
And there is no supposition.

01:57.192 --> 02:00.471
He stole the treasure of Pompeii

02:00.524 --> 02:02.742
from the Museo Nazionale.

02:02.808 --> 02:05.436
During the eruption,
the building caught fire.

02:05.468 --> 02:08.978
In the chaos, this
Honeyman, he broke in.

02:09.103 --> 02:10.894
I see. And...

02:10.933 --> 02:13.205
- How do you know it was him?
- As I said,

02:13.409 --> 02:16.800
I'm a detective. I detected it.

02:17.688 --> 02:19.795
What would you like us to do?

02:19.920 --> 02:23.009
Honeyman arrived in Toronto yesterday.

02:23.022 --> 02:25.800
I believe he has come
to sell the treasure.

02:26.032 --> 02:30.536
These items are a part of my
country's identity, Detective.

02:31.919 --> 02:34.308
I must find them.

02:38.450 --> 02:40.973
Margaret! Open the door!

02:41.019 --> 02:43.376
I'm not leaving until we talk!

02:47.149 --> 02:49.353
Where's your mother? Margaret!

02:49.387 --> 02:52.665
- She went to Aunt Lizzy's with Bobby..
- Well, when is she coming back?

02:53.114 --> 02:54.344
She didn't say.

02:54.812 --> 02:58.229
Your mother and I... we'll sort it.

02:59.737 --> 03:02.853
- I'm late for patrol.
- John.

03:03.879 --> 03:05.895
There's a letter for you on the table.

03:06.294 --> 03:08.080
I'll see you later.

03:27.163 --> 03:30.974
The clerk recognised a
photograph of Mr. Honeyman,

03:30.995 --> 03:34.057
but he must have rented the
locker under a different name.

03:34.079 --> 03:35.764
The treasures could be in there.

03:35.796 --> 03:38.651
- Where is the locker, George?
- It's this one here, sir.

03:54.844 --> 03:56.899
Ha! Ha! Ha!

03:56.920 --> 03:59.379
Ecco qua! Well done!

03:59.860 --> 04:03.383
Let's make sure it's what you're
actually looking for. George?

04:18.884 --> 04:20.459
Honeyman.

04:27.981 --> 04:31.896
- This is terrible!
- Hopefully he didn't suffer too much, sir.

04:31.920 --> 04:34.418
No, I was referring to
the missing treasure.

04:34.476 --> 04:37.004
The man was a thief.
He died as he lived.

04:37.072 --> 04:40.675
Based on lividity, we can speculate
that it happened very recently.

04:41.201 --> 04:44.630
George, find out what ships have
departed in the past few hours.

04:44.661 --> 04:47.817
- Sir, right away.
- You believe the killer has left the city?

04:47.826 --> 04:50.555
It's possible. John, canvass the area

04:50.588 --> 04:52.615
and find out if anyone has seen or heard

04:52.641 --> 04:54.886
- anything out of the ordinary.
- Sir.

05:00.553 --> 05:03.345
- What do you mean by strange?
- Gunshot, shouting,

05:03.360 --> 05:06.411
- anyone suspicious hanging about?
- I couldn't say.

05:06.536 --> 05:08.048
Gets mighty loud in here.

05:08.317 --> 05:10.798
Sometimes I can't hear myself
think over the din of these boys.

05:11.562 --> 05:13.143
Thank you for your time.

05:25.422 --> 05:26.964
Detective?

05:27.302 --> 05:29.387
No ships have left
since yesterday evening.

05:29.425 --> 05:31.826
So the treasure might
still be in the city!

05:31.951 --> 05:34.661
We have constables checking
all of the docked ships.

05:35.136 --> 05:38.307
Is there anyone who might
have any direct information?

05:40.012 --> 05:42.420
Well, there is someone
who knows an awful lot

05:42.442 --> 05:46.050
- about stolen merchandise.
- Sir, I'll bring in Eddie Crawford.

05:46.481 --> 05:48.077
I will join you.

05:49.925 --> 05:53.653
Is there a place where
I can have a cappuccino?

05:54.026 --> 05:55.581
A what?

06:11.274 --> 06:13.144
I don't know anyone named Honeyman.

06:13.165 --> 06:15.889
Have you heard anything
about this Italian treasure?

06:15.920 --> 06:19.398
Detective, I know you like
to entertain a fantasy of me

06:19.418 --> 06:22.595
as some sort of criminal mastermind, but

06:22.648 --> 06:25.613
I'm just a simple businessman
trying to make a living.

06:26.029 --> 06:27.394
I just can't help you.

06:27.519 --> 06:29.553
I'm a curio man.

06:29.586 --> 06:33.247
Italian antiquities don't
exactly fly off my shelves.

06:33.372 --> 06:37.250
In my country, we are not
so nice to men like you.

06:37.293 --> 06:41.427
Consider yourself fortunate
that Detective Murdoch is here.

06:41.475 --> 06:43.961
Well, this is Canada, sir.

06:44.235 --> 06:47.533
But, seeing as you're
desperate to find your loot,

06:47.538 --> 06:50.303
I could perhaps ask around...

06:50.504 --> 06:52.678
For a finder's fee, of course.

06:53.148 --> 06:54.733
Ha! Ha!

06:55.112 --> 06:56.860
I see.

07:02.240 --> 07:03.519
- You dog!
- Hey!

07:03.533 --> 07:05.560
- You think I would pay you?
- Are you just gonna let...

07:05.584 --> 07:07.196
- Give me a name.
- Detective...

07:07.221 --> 07:08.939
- A name!
- Alright, alright!

07:09.064 --> 07:10.747
Aldous Germaine!

07:11.490 --> 07:13.019
He is a...

07:13.593 --> 07:15.771
bigwig in that world.

07:15.973 --> 07:17.649
Maybe he can help you.

07:26.082 --> 07:27.495
What's the damage?

07:27.889 --> 07:30.187
Take my advice. Have another.

07:30.548 --> 07:32.151
Action's about to start.

07:32.276 --> 07:34.067
- What's going on?
- Bare-knuckle match.

07:34.113 --> 07:35.576
Dan Seavey's in town.

07:35.701 --> 07:38.452
- Who the bloody hell is Dan Seavey?
- Clear a path!

07:38.487 --> 07:40.716
Clear a path! Clear a path!

07:41.512 --> 07:43.134
Let's get this thing going.

07:43.298 --> 07:46.487
Tables to the walls, boys,
come on! Tables to the walls!

07:46.516 --> 07:47.802
Now...

07:50.005 --> 07:51.987
Which one of you milksops

07:52.062 --> 07:54.937
is gonna be betting
against Dan Seavey, huh?

07:58.245 --> 08:00.161
You?

08:01.026 --> 08:02.346
You?!

08:03.519 --> 08:05.961
I already see the fear
in your eyes, mate.

08:06.163 --> 08:09.103
Damn shame. Gonna have to go home and

08:09.134 --> 08:12.172
explain to his wife
where all the money went.

08:14.476 --> 08:16.879
Which one of you monks am
I meant to be anointing?

08:16.925 --> 08:18.321
Huh?

08:18.940 --> 08:21.891
- Huh?
- That'd be me.

08:30.360 --> 08:33.090
Oh, Hennie, this city
doesn't deserve you.

08:33.128 --> 08:35.495
I trust you'll be getting
some sort of commendation, yes?

08:35.533 --> 08:38.239
Well, that might be a tad much, Ruthie.

08:40.000 --> 08:42.764
- Am I interrupting?
- Oh, not at all.

08:42.798 --> 08:45.605
- Did you hear what Henry did, Dr. Ogden?
- Ruthie, I...

08:45.861 --> 08:47.259
No, I don't believe I did.

08:47.293 --> 08:50.415
He fought off six men who
were attacking an old woman

08:50.437 --> 08:52.413
- on her way to church.
- Six, really?

08:52.426 --> 08:54.798
Then he had to walk himself
all the way to the hospital

08:54.807 --> 08:56.403
on a broken leg.

08:56.528 --> 08:57.988
What an incredible story.

08:58.013 --> 09:00.466
- When will I be able to go home, Doctor?
- Yes.

09:00.500 --> 09:02.610
It shouldn't be longer
than a day or two.

09:02.677 --> 09:04.153
So he'll have to spend the night?

09:05.100 --> 09:07.278
No, no, no, no, no,
these linens will not do.

09:07.303 --> 09:09.178
I am going to pop down to Regine's

09:09.200 --> 09:11.745
and get you a set fit for a hero.

09:21.100 --> 09:22.520
Ahem!

09:26.692 --> 09:27.972
Don't move.

09:34.794 --> 09:35.946
Well...

09:36.392 --> 09:39.981
you told the admitting nurse
that you were fixing a car...

09:40.639 --> 09:42.152
when a wrench dropped on your foot

09:42.161 --> 09:43.594
and you tripped into a wall.

09:45.124 --> 09:47.990
Please, Dr. Ogden. Ruth doesn't
know I've taken on a second job.

09:48.414 --> 09:49.950
I can't bear to tell her.

10:14.102 --> 10:15.611
- Son of a...
- Oi!

10:16.657 --> 10:18.409
Don't make me break your arm!

10:18.485 --> 10:19.995
This is supposed to be a fair fight.

10:31.903 --> 10:34.582
Yes! Yes! I knew he could do it!

10:34.836 --> 10:36.298
See?

10:36.880 --> 10:40.630
Anyone, anytime, anywhere.

10:44.015 --> 10:45.528
Where are you going?

10:46.451 --> 10:48.878
No, no, you stay for a drink.

10:49.269 --> 10:50.588
Another time.

10:55.427 --> 10:57.618
I was certainly nowhere near the docks,

10:57.899 --> 11:00.041
nor have I heard of
this Honeyman fellow.

11:00.166 --> 11:03.214
- And where were you last night?
- The theatre.

11:03.293 --> 11:06.235
An electrifying performance
of The Bride of Lammermoor.

11:06.424 --> 11:08.768
Hm. Mr. Germaine,

11:08.788 --> 11:11.375
do you know of anyone in your circles

11:11.402 --> 11:13.980
- who would be capable of such an act?
- I don't.

11:14.254 --> 11:16.576
And I wouldn't associate
with perpetrators of violence.

11:16.601 --> 11:19.163
I'm a pacifist of the highest order.

11:20.338 --> 11:22.083
Are you a Pisces, dear boy?

11:22.403 --> 11:25.067
- Pardon me?
- Pisces. Astrology.

11:25.278 --> 11:27.335
Our connection to the stars.

11:29.458 --> 11:31.023
I don't exactly know.

11:31.191 --> 11:32.822
How do you fair in water?

11:33.408 --> 11:35.918
- I'm not particularly fond of it.
- Enough!

11:35.952 --> 11:39.152
If the treasure had been sold
in Toronto, you would've heard.

11:39.211 --> 11:41.241
I can't account for every trade, but

11:41.326 --> 11:43.585
if something of that size had occurred,

11:43.597 --> 11:45.514
I would likely know about it, yes.

11:45.818 --> 11:47.630
If one wanted to sell

11:47.755 --> 11:50.163
such an item, where would one go?

11:50.630 --> 11:52.475
Without a specific buyer,

11:52.488 --> 11:54.711
I suppose the Sunday auction
would be the most likely place.

11:54.735 --> 11:57.288
- What is that?
- Every third Sunday of the month,

11:57.312 --> 12:00.576
a private auction is held
in a different location.

12:00.596 --> 12:01.730
That's today.

12:01.764 --> 12:03.495
As a matter of fact it is.

12:04.018 --> 12:06.913
- You are a Pisces, aren't you?
- We must go!

12:06.926 --> 12:11.073
Unfortunately, invitation only. Or...

12:11.198 --> 12:13.134
accompany me as my guest.

12:14.049 --> 12:16.816
Absolutely not! It has to be me!

12:16.884 --> 12:20.802
Detectives, you have the
hardened look of policemen

12:20.807 --> 12:23.135
who've been lied to their entire lives.

12:23.841 --> 12:26.517
This young man has the eyes of a doe.

12:26.701 --> 12:28.177
Uncorrupted.

12:28.919 --> 12:31.970
No one would doubt for a second
that he would be my companion.

12:33.008 --> 12:34.092
Fine.

12:34.129 --> 12:35.578
- Ma no!
- George?

12:35.703 --> 12:38.206
- Can you handle it?
- Sir, I believe I can.

12:38.566 --> 12:41.341
- Right, then.
- Good. It's settled, then.

12:42.432 --> 12:45.334
Of course, he'll have to dress the part.

12:45.539 --> 12:47.915
Driver!

12:51.823 --> 12:55.225
Gentlemen, meet Boston Rhodes.

12:55.695 --> 12:57.485
Dashing, isn't he?

12:57.610 --> 12:59.745
This is unacceptable, Detective!

12:59.778 --> 13:01.600
My country's history is in the balance!

13:01.631 --> 13:03.448
I'm afraid we have no other choice.

13:03.573 --> 13:04.971
Oof!

13:12.297 --> 13:16.913
Mr. Germaine, would it be fair to
describe this material as luxurious?

13:16.941 --> 13:18.803
This is velvet, dear boy.

13:18.804 --> 13:22.272
- Luxury is woven into its very fibres.
- I knew it.

13:22.293 --> 13:24.846
Right. Let's make sure we
all understand the plan.

13:24.971 --> 13:26.854
- George...
- Boston.

13:26.895 --> 13:29.561
... will accompany Mr.
Germaine to the auction

13:29.602 --> 13:31.773
posing as a wealthy collector.

13:31.799 --> 13:34.719
Detective Pupazzi will provide
us with a list of the items.

13:34.734 --> 13:37.047
Should any of the items
come up for auction,

13:37.172 --> 13:39.754
Boston will attempt to procure them.

13:39.802 --> 13:42.798
- How exciting!
- We will then identify the seller

13:42.836 --> 13:44.790
- and apprehend him.
- Bene.

13:44.849 --> 13:47.476
It will be important
to establish our boy

13:47.509 --> 13:50.196
as an authentic collector
so suspicions aren't raised.

13:50.232 --> 13:51.855
How do you suggest we do that?

13:51.913 --> 13:56.563
It would be my honour to introduce
you as a close personal friend.

13:56.688 --> 13:59.102
- Good thinking.
- He would of course need capital.

13:59.227 --> 14:01.268
There must be some money
the police have set aside

14:01.293 --> 14:05.370
- for such an occasion.
- Oh... that could prove to be difficult.

14:05.403 --> 14:08.009
I'll have to discuss
it with the Inspector.

14:09.990 --> 14:12.202
I realise it's a large sum, but

14:12.219 --> 14:14.793
I believe it's the best
way to catch the thief and

14:14.918 --> 14:16.847
hopefully, by proxy, the killer.

14:18.828 --> 14:20.162
Sir?

14:20.466 --> 14:22.568
That's fine, Murdoch. Carry on.

14:22.754 --> 14:26.351
So you'll sign the form
to release the funds?

14:26.431 --> 14:27.746
Funds.

14:28.942 --> 14:30.311
Hang on, how much?

14:30.638 --> 14:32.528
Well, sir, I've put in for $50.

14:32.556 --> 14:36.005
But I've instructed George to keep
the bidding as low as possible.

14:37.063 --> 14:40.413
60, then. You sign for
it, bring me the receipt.

14:40.788 --> 14:42.278
All right.

14:45.355 --> 14:47.072
Sir, is everything all right?

14:48.130 --> 14:49.548
How do you mean?

14:51.322 --> 14:52.508
Nothing.

14:52.576 --> 14:53.866
Thank you.

15:13.177 --> 15:16.437
- Were they expensive?
- Only the best for my bonbon.

15:16.475 --> 15:20.615
Now, Henry, I was thinking...
you're working far too much.

15:21.346 --> 15:23.017
Seems to me that those police people

15:23.038 --> 15:25.056
need you far more than you need them.

15:25.498 --> 15:27.327
Well, I suppose there
may be some truth to that.

15:27.351 --> 15:30.138
I think you need to take
a break. Just a few weeks.

15:30.163 --> 15:33.155
After all, I can't have you injuring
yourself for the sake of others.

15:33.209 --> 15:34.831
You have me to look after, now.

15:34.884 --> 15:37.634
Oh dear, I'm not sure the
Inspector will allow that.

15:37.676 --> 15:39.836
Oh, pish! After everything you've done!

15:39.861 --> 15:41.316
I'll go speak to him myself.

15:41.336 --> 15:43.428
- You stay right there.
- No, wait! I...

15:44.293 --> 15:46.142
I have to tell you something.

15:46.869 --> 15:48.938
I wasn't injured saving an old woman.

15:50.586 --> 15:52.351
What do you mean?

15:52.899 --> 15:55.111
I took on a second
job at George's garage.

15:55.144 --> 15:56.999
That's how I hurt myself.

15:57.251 --> 15:58.721
A second... ?

15:58.868 --> 16:00.923
Why? Is that even allowed?

16:00.948 --> 16:03.274
Ruthie, I'm afraid I won't be
able to provide you with the things

16:03.298 --> 16:05.363
that you're accustomed to
on a constable's salary.

16:05.404 --> 16:08.951
Oh, my needs are so simple!
How much do you make?

16:08.976 --> 16:10.421
About a dollar a day.

16:11.658 --> 16:12.769
I beg your pardon?

16:12.817 --> 16:14.624
- A dollar.
- A day?

16:15.043 --> 16:17.990
I know it doesn't sound like much,
but it's actually quite reasonable.

16:18.022 --> 16:20.071
- You'll need to ask for a raise.
- I have.

16:20.613 --> 16:21.863
They said no.

16:21.988 --> 16:25.510
In time, I may be able to work
my way up to a ten cent raise.

16:27.807 --> 16:30.052
Then I shall get a job.

16:30.077 --> 16:32.506
Ruthie, no. You wouldn't want that.

16:32.565 --> 16:35.972
What I want is for my husband
to be back in one piece.

16:36.047 --> 16:37.264
Besides,

16:37.442 --> 16:38.965
how hard can it be to find work?

16:39.090 --> 16:40.828
Seems like something everybody does.

16:55.582 --> 16:58.727
Gentlemen, may I
introduce my dear friend

16:58.738 --> 17:01.519
and fellow collector, Mr. Boston Rhodes.

17:01.899 --> 17:05.453
Mr. Rhodes' interests tend
toward goods of an Italian nature.

17:05.511 --> 17:09.913
Yes, I'm looking to buy something
very expensive and Italian.

17:10.220 --> 17:12.493
Mr. Rhodes is in from New York City.

17:12.516 --> 17:14.348
He'll be staying with me for a few days.

17:14.402 --> 17:17.287
You always do uncover the
best gems, don't you, Aldy?

17:17.502 --> 17:19.762
Some excellent options
in New York, I'm told?

17:19.778 --> 17:23.848
Oh, excellent is not the
word! They are excellent!

17:23.851 --> 17:26.531
Boston and I dined
at Molto Bene tonight.

17:26.595 --> 17:29.892
He spent the entire time
discussing his recent trip to Italy.

17:29.929 --> 17:32.073
Did he? Which parts did you visit?

17:32.115 --> 17:35.686
The south. The heel of
the boot, as we call it.

17:35.712 --> 17:38.584
But also the... ball of the foot.

17:39.048 --> 17:41.439
Old boy almost took my hand
off when I reached for the bill.

17:41.454 --> 17:43.757
Never lets me pay for a thing.

17:53.534 --> 17:56.594
You two have either become
the fastest friends in history,

17:56.635 --> 17:59.344
or else that whole thing
was a sham to begin with.

18:00.250 --> 18:02.352
Oh, catches on quick, doesn't he?

18:02.595 --> 18:06.144
No refunds. What do you
intend to do about it?

18:06.349 --> 18:08.958
Just admiring your
commitment to realism, is all.

18:09.136 --> 18:10.685
You had everybody fooled.

18:10.810 --> 18:13.083
I'm Dan. This is Willis.

18:13.804 --> 18:17.054
We don't normally drink with anyone
unless we get their name first.

18:17.276 --> 18:18.708
Tom.

18:25.243 --> 18:27.757
You gonna take that standing up, Tom?

18:30.126 --> 18:31.559
Thank you.

18:32.477 --> 18:35.005
You look like a man with questions.

18:36.616 --> 18:38.508
How did everybody know who you were?

18:38.633 --> 18:41.931
Oh, I'm known in certain circles.

18:41.983 --> 18:44.933
- The ones that matter.
- What do you do?

18:45.008 --> 18:47.230
That's a bit harder to answer.

18:47.295 --> 18:48.996
We do lots of things.

18:49.729 --> 18:51.693
The bartender said that you're pirates.

18:51.714 --> 18:54.227
But that's not true.

18:54.248 --> 18:56.712
This is not a bloody Stevenson novel.

18:57.413 --> 19:00.401
I'm the captain for a merchant vessel.

19:01.159 --> 19:05.376
You know, people spin tales based
on their own childhood fantasies.

19:06.846 --> 19:08.511
Tell me, what is it you do,

19:08.521 --> 19:11.213
- aside from asking bloody questions?
- Me?

19:11.338 --> 19:13.842
Amongst other things, I drink!

19:16.955 --> 19:19.704
Going once, going twice...

19:19.921 --> 19:23.301
Sold to the gentleman
in the feathered top hat.

19:23.566 --> 19:27.877
- Nothing's come up.
- Our last item of the day:

19:28.002 --> 19:33.056
an Italian chamber
pot from the mid-1500s,

19:33.181 --> 19:36.115
likely from the House of Medici.

19:36.156 --> 19:39.185
- The treasures are not here.
- I did say that was a possibility.

19:39.197 --> 19:41.699
Bidding begins at five dollars.

19:41.982 --> 19:44.652
Five dollars. Do I hear six?

19:45.137 --> 19:47.614
- What are you doing?
- I'm trying to get noticed.

19:47.634 --> 19:50.432
Six from the man in
velvet. Do I hear seven?

19:50.922 --> 19:54.676
Seven for the gentleman in
the moustache. Do I hear eight?

19:55.025 --> 19:57.778
Eight again down here. Do I hear nine?

19:57.982 --> 20:00.064
This is taking too long!

20:00.448 --> 20:01.932
You have a frame of reference

20:01.964 --> 20:04.409
for how long underground
auctions should take?

20:04.451 --> 20:07.474
It may not mean much to a
citizen of such a young country,

20:07.490 --> 20:10.608
but those treasures are
the blueprint of my nation!

20:10.645 --> 20:13.731
- Forgive me for being anxious!
- I understand.

20:13.789 --> 20:18.063
Also, the food here is terrible
and I just want to go home!

20:19.169 --> 20:21.270
Do I hear thirty-five?

20:21.395 --> 20:23.778
Thirty-five down here. May I hear forty?

20:23.836 --> 20:26.474
Forty down here again.
Do I hear forty-five?

20:26.599 --> 20:29.924
Forty-five! And do I hear fifty?

20:29.982 --> 20:31.595
Fifty!

20:31.720 --> 20:35.292
Going once, going twice...

20:36.173 --> 20:38.588
Sold for fifty dollars

20:38.615 --> 20:41.534
to the gentleman in the
impeccable purple suit.

20:41.659 --> 20:44.683
Gracious, I got carried away. I
didn't realise it'd go so high.

20:44.715 --> 20:48.339
Well, it is an original, I suppose.

20:48.576 --> 20:50.479
Are you sure you know what you're doing?

20:50.537 --> 20:54.045
I'm quite sure I do not.

20:57.738 --> 21:00.409
She's at her sister's in bloody Grimsby.

21:00.451 --> 21:01.978
Do you want her to come back?

21:02.584 --> 21:04.163
She's my wife.

21:04.395 --> 21:05.660
Of course I do.

21:05.939 --> 21:08.667
Well, it doesn't have to
be a foregone conclusion.

21:09.252 --> 21:10.695
How do you mean?

21:11.733 --> 21:13.703
I've travelled the world, Tom.

21:14.236 --> 21:17.027
Seen a lot of places. I've
talked to a lot of people.

21:17.732 --> 21:20.846
Every culture has its
own views on marriage.

21:22.135 --> 21:24.980
- Want to know what I've learned?
- Go on.

21:25.470 --> 21:30.102
Only black vultures and owl
monkeys are faithful for life.

21:30.138 --> 21:32.825
What about swans?

21:32.840 --> 21:34.400
Even swans stray.

21:35.964 --> 21:37.729
I had a family once.

21:38.423 --> 21:42.096
But I knew in my heart I couldn't
give them what they needed.

21:43.885 --> 21:45.451
So I left.

21:46.903 --> 21:51.070
I wager they're a lot happier
now than when I was around,

21:51.671 --> 21:54.309
half in, half out.

21:54.857 --> 21:56.722
And now you live on your boat.

21:57.259 --> 22:00.778
I go where opportunity takes me.

22:01.748 --> 22:03.471
One thing's certain...

22:03.729 --> 22:06.537
somewhere, someone...

22:06.731 --> 22:09.587
always needs a ship.

22:12.717 --> 22:14.443
When you left your family,

22:14.892 --> 22:16.656
how did you handle the pain?

22:17.805 --> 22:20.090
Another thing I learned on my travels...

22:20.923 --> 22:23.935
all pain is desire.

22:24.846 --> 22:27.624
Is that a criticism or advice?

22:28.450 --> 22:31.622
I think that's actually
something they call Buddhism.

22:32.184 --> 22:33.534
Buddhism?

22:43.584 --> 22:50.307
Apparently, it was used by a
king or prince of some kind.

22:50.320 --> 22:53.892
Explain to me again why you bid on
something that was not on the list?

22:53.929 --> 22:56.604
Sir, when I saw our items
weren't up for auction,

22:56.635 --> 22:59.259
I thought this would be another
way of at least making myself known

22:59.275 --> 23:01.682
in case the seller was indeed there.

23:02.083 --> 23:06.578
Perhaps I just don't understand the
intricacies of the antique world.

23:06.626 --> 23:09.893
It's a waste bucket. What
is there to understand?

23:10.086 --> 23:12.321
Ah, Mr. Germaine.

23:12.358 --> 23:15.423
We were just discussing the
effectiveness of this purchase.

23:15.502 --> 23:18.763
Well, I bring good tidings.
George's idea worked.

23:18.888 --> 23:22.262
A man named Lloyd Trammel made
contact with me about an hour ago.

23:22.387 --> 23:25.548
He said he had some items my
friend would be interested in.

23:25.765 --> 23:27.808
One of a kind, direct from Italy.

23:27.933 --> 23:31.364
- He even mentioned the ring of Antinous.
- One of the treasures!

23:31.416 --> 23:34.467
You did it, Georgio! Bravo ragazzo!

23:35.377 --> 23:36.959
Just a moment. Just a moment.

23:36.980 --> 23:39.528
Who is this Trammel?
What's his reputation?

23:39.723 --> 23:42.020
Well, not good, frankly.

23:42.063 --> 23:46.267
He is known to associate with
criminals and other sordid types.

23:46.488 --> 23:49.227
Right. Set up a meeting
with this Trammel.

23:49.289 --> 23:50.712
But somewhere public.

23:56.949 --> 23:58.686
Perhaps I could try on dresses.

23:58.750 --> 24:01.952
- Yes, you could be a model!
- Oh no, no, no, Henry,

24:01.958 --> 24:04.317
those women are of low moral character.

24:04.334 --> 24:06.925
No, I was thinking
more: I try on dresses

24:06.942 --> 24:09.064
and then I just give
my opinion about them.

24:10.239 --> 24:14.078
Well, I'm not sure there's a
deficit for that kind of work.

24:14.300 --> 24:16.086
Ruthie, I do wish you'd reconsider this.

24:16.113 --> 24:18.957
Henry, you're in the hospital.
I hardly see you anymore.

24:18.983 --> 24:21.405
No, my mind is quite made up.

24:25.958 --> 24:27.680
Yes. Yes, it is.

24:28.737 --> 24:31.398
Perhaps you could clean
other people's homes?

24:32.742 --> 24:35.872
Perhaps I could just roll
around in the dirt as well.

24:36.403 --> 24:39.159
What about them? I've seen
them all over the place.

24:40.147 --> 24:42.118
- You mean a nurse?
- Yes!

24:42.198 --> 24:43.704
I could be that.

24:45.016 --> 24:47.971
There's much more to being a
nurse than handing out medication.

24:47.987 --> 24:50.969
Well, I'm sure with your
guidance I could learn.

24:51.005 --> 24:52.858
Would you teach me, Doctor?

24:54.208 --> 24:56.873
I'm not trained to be
a nursing instructor.

24:56.910 --> 25:00.044
Oh, please! Please,
please, please, please!

25:00.113 --> 25:02.788
- Oh!
- Oh...

25:03.758 --> 25:05.265
alright.

25:05.390 --> 25:06.872
- George.
- Sir.

25:06.930 --> 25:09.789
I have the bullet that
Miss Hart retrieved

25:09.826 --> 25:11.849
from the body of Mr. Honeyman.

25:13.230 --> 25:14.714
Just as I thought.

25:15.926 --> 25:19.108
- This is an antique.
- How can you tell, sir?

25:19.491 --> 25:21.584
It matches this casing

25:21.598 --> 25:24.116
- I found at the scene of the crime.
- Good lord.

25:24.173 --> 25:26.482
Doesn't look like any
bullet casing I've ever seen.

25:26.665 --> 25:28.757
As improbable as it may seem,

25:28.768 --> 25:30.705
in the early part of the 18th century,

25:30.715 --> 25:33.338
bullet casings were often
made of a thick paper.

25:33.365 --> 25:36.035
Paper, sir? Doesn't seem very wise.

25:36.271 --> 25:40.534
Well, a modern firearm would never
be able to fire such a casing.

25:40.792 --> 25:44.638
Whoever shot Mr. Honeyman
used an antique weapon.

25:51.009 --> 25:52.336
John.

25:53.425 --> 25:54.858
Where are you going?

25:54.983 --> 25:57.913
Have a seat.

25:58.236 --> 26:01.116
Tell me what's happening.

26:01.401 --> 26:03.529
These differences your mother
and I have been having...

26:03.550 --> 26:05.980
They're more than just differences!
She said you betrayed her!

26:05.990 --> 26:07.987
I know she feels that way, but...

26:08.208 --> 26:11.952
Look, I've only ever had my
family's best interests at heart,

26:11.983 --> 26:14.865
- tried to do the right thing.
- By leaving us?

26:16.846 --> 26:19.037
John, please, have a seat.

26:37.143 --> 26:38.976
Your mother's made a decision.

26:39.229 --> 26:41.131
I'm not going to her cap in hand.

26:43.705 --> 26:45.186
You could still fight.

26:45.244 --> 26:48.410
You could fight for Mother.
You could fight for us.

26:49.367 --> 26:51.027
I'm sorry, John.

26:52.607 --> 26:54.604
I do know you'll take care of things.

26:54.925 --> 26:56.605
You're the man of the house now.

26:57.521 --> 26:59.313
Just keep an eye on your brother.

27:04.221 --> 27:06.756
Once you've confirmed
he has the stolen goods,

27:06.818 --> 27:09.952
blow the whistle. If he
asks, this is the money.

27:10.432 --> 27:12.175
What if he wants to look inside?

27:12.212 --> 27:15.009
Then you'll have to convince him
to show you the treasure first.

27:15.036 --> 27:16.868
You should go, it's time.

27:18.412 --> 27:20.130
Buona fortuna.

27:33.502 --> 27:34.961
Trammel?

27:44.642 --> 27:45.990
Mr. Trammel!

27:46.032 --> 27:49.172
- Did you see who attacked you?
- Is that him?

27:50.257 --> 27:52.085
Where is the treasure?

27:52.210 --> 27:55.578
- Talk!
- They... they... they took everything.

28:04.208 --> 28:06.829
I already told you, I
don't know who did it.

28:06.884 --> 28:08.842
One minute I'm waiting
for your man Boston

28:08.853 --> 28:11.480
to show with the money;
the next, I'm seeing stars.

28:11.518 --> 28:14.615
So you didn't know Mr. Honeyman
had already been killed.

28:14.666 --> 28:16.642
Last he and I spoke
was down at the docks

28:16.657 --> 28:18.928
when I picked up the goods.
He was alive and breathing.

28:18.943 --> 28:22.890
- Can you prove that?
- How would I possibly?

28:23.474 --> 28:26.025
What was your arrangement
with Mr. Honeyman?

28:26.257 --> 28:29.915
That I would sell the goods
for him at a 25% commission.

28:29.950 --> 28:31.777
But there was nothing to stop you

28:31.788 --> 28:34.468
from killing him and keeping 100%!

28:34.500 --> 28:36.569
Except the fact that I'm not a murderer.

28:37.597 --> 28:39.795
So you knew that the
treasure was stolen.

28:40.306 --> 28:42.412
I didn't ask to see a bill of sale.

28:43.403 --> 28:47.436
- This man is obviously lying.
- Hey, Pupoozo,

28:47.458 --> 28:50.372
I'm the victim here. I got
no reason to lie to you.

28:50.409 --> 28:52.832
Unless of course you
did kill Mr. Honeyman.

28:52.857 --> 28:55.787
No, I've known him for
years. We were friends.

28:56.913 --> 28:59.275
Do you own any antique...

28:59.443 --> 29:01.852
firearms, Mr. Trammel?

29:01.898 --> 29:04.263
No. No resale value.

29:04.606 --> 29:05.933
Why?

29:07.155 --> 29:10.201
- Can you tell us anything else about the attack?
- Actually, yes.

29:10.252 --> 29:11.885
Right before I lost consciousness,

29:11.923 --> 29:14.236
I saw a man carting a crate away.

29:15.026 --> 29:17.500
Was there anything distinct about him?

29:17.542 --> 29:19.955
He... he had a tattoo on his arm.

29:20.057 --> 29:21.825
"The Wanderer".

29:24.000 --> 29:27.855
Just leave me be, please!

29:28.886 --> 29:30.193
What are you doing?

29:30.642 --> 29:32.865
I'm just changing the
sheets. These are wrinkled.

29:33.892 --> 29:36.226
Are you all right, Mr. Stickley?

29:36.272 --> 29:39.133
- I just want to be left alone.
- Yes, of course. Lay down.

29:40.070 --> 29:41.770
A word, please?

29:44.904 --> 29:47.182
This patient is terminally ill!

29:47.284 --> 29:49.419
We're just trying to
keep him comfortable.

29:49.441 --> 29:51.653
What could be more
comfortable than clean linens?

29:54.224 --> 29:56.798
When I said that you
could spend time here,

29:56.826 --> 30:00.229
I meant more to observe,
take note, that sort of thing.

30:00.354 --> 30:03.994
Well, how am I supposed to
learn if I don't do anything?

30:04.769 --> 30:07.382
When a patient nears the end,

30:07.507 --> 30:10.462
they often just need peace and quiet,

30:10.748 --> 30:13.008
to rest and reflect...

30:13.076 --> 30:15.545
- We have to respect that!
- Dr. Ogden, you're needed.

30:19.603 --> 30:22.357
Wait right here. And
don't touch anything!

30:28.683 --> 30:30.518
Can you imagine how we felt

30:30.544 --> 30:34.015
when the man that we trusted had
squandered our entire fortune?

30:34.064 --> 30:36.068
Sounds like family, all right.

30:36.316 --> 30:39.792
Haven't seen one of my kids
since I've been in here.

30:40.136 --> 30:41.878
Did your man go to prison?

30:42.147 --> 30:44.113
Actually, I don't know
what became of him.

30:44.534 --> 30:46.108
Hopefully he hanged.

30:46.161 --> 30:49.201
Beggar would have deserved it!

30:51.281 --> 30:53.516
Feeling a bit better, I see.

30:53.641 --> 30:57.186
Ruth was just telling me how
her family fortune was lost.

30:57.209 --> 30:59.067
Yes, well, we are coping.

30:59.131 --> 31:02.381
And I see the bedding's been changed.

31:02.696 --> 31:05.119
Miss Newsome, another word, please.

31:10.500 --> 31:11.678
What are you doing?

31:11.714 --> 31:13.595
I thought hearing about
people worse off than him

31:13.604 --> 31:14.895
might help him feel better.

31:15.116 --> 31:18.003
- But this man is dying!
- Yes, exactly.

31:20.000 --> 31:22.276
And how did you manage
to change the linens?

31:22.290 --> 31:24.455
Oh, I've known how to do that
since I was a little girl.

31:24.471 --> 31:27.125
When my mama was ill, she didn't
like the servants touching her,

31:27.151 --> 31:29.123
- so it fell to me.
- Ruth?

31:29.452 --> 31:32.597
Coming! Where were we?

31:32.722 --> 31:36.017
Oh, I remember. My brother Roger...

31:36.079 --> 31:38.651
Mr. Trammel seemed genuinely surprised

31:38.662 --> 31:40.119
that Mr. Honeyman had been killed.

31:41.131 --> 31:43.528
However, he is the last
person that we know of

31:43.567 --> 31:46.267
- to have seen him alive.
- Indeed.

31:46.914 --> 31:50.691
Perhaps someone learned of their
arrangement. A potential buyer

31:50.718 --> 31:53.710
- who planned to rob Mr. Honeyman.
- Enough!

31:53.962 --> 31:56.412
Enough with all these guesses!

31:56.597 --> 31:59.781
The heart of my
country, it is out there,

31:59.789 --> 32:01.369
set to be sold!

32:01.443 --> 32:04.298
My concern is not with
some thieving murder victim!

32:04.362 --> 32:07.066
You're an officer of the law.
It's your duty to be concerned

32:07.096 --> 32:09.726
- regardless of the country of origin.
- Why?

32:09.826 --> 32:12.894
Why, because one criminal
decides to kill another?

32:12.915 --> 32:16.798
These men contribute nothing!
They steal and they kill!

32:16.818 --> 32:19.578
That's all they do!
You, sir, have lost sight

32:19.599 --> 32:21.412
of what is most important!

32:21.892 --> 32:25.701
Now, unless you want me to
report you to your superior,

32:25.709 --> 32:28.086
you will help me find the treasure!

32:31.347 --> 32:34.450
My job is to catch killers, Detective.

32:34.807 --> 32:39.486
If we happen to find your nation's
treasure in the process, so be it.

32:39.548 --> 32:43.246
But I will not be intimidated
in my own stationhouse,

32:43.720 --> 32:46.296
in my own office.

32:46.396 --> 32:49.257
- Yes, John?
- Sir, may I speak with you privately?

32:52.612 --> 32:54.419
I was just leaving.

32:54.756 --> 32:58.508
I'm going to try and make
myself a decent cup of coffee.

32:59.576 --> 33:01.346
For a change.

33:04.058 --> 33:05.381
John.

33:10.790 --> 33:12.787
Sir, I'm worried about my father.

33:13.292 --> 33:16.952
- What about, exactly?
- He's gone off to live with criminals.

33:18.038 --> 33:20.029
Gone off to live... ?

33:20.883 --> 33:22.711
He and Mother have separated.

33:23.310 --> 33:24.817
Oh.

33:24.865 --> 33:26.724
I went home and found
him packing a suitcase.

33:26.751 --> 33:28.442
He didn't say where he was going, but...

33:28.638 --> 33:30.334
he left this behind.

33:32.577 --> 33:34.309
"The Wanderer".

33:56.180 --> 33:57.986
Let's get moving!

34:22.900 --> 34:26.414
- I can't believe you have cannons.
- Picked it up in Boston.

34:26.643 --> 34:28.217
British.

34:28.449 --> 34:31.786
- They say it was fired during the Tea Party.
- And do you use them?

34:31.846 --> 34:34.750
Well, sometimes you run
into some trouble, but

34:34.771 --> 34:38.108
usually when people catch a glimpse
of that, they tuck tail and turn.

34:38.141 --> 34:40.510
Come on, Tom,

34:40.722 --> 34:42.878
I'll show you around.

34:43.896 --> 34:46.010
She's a fine vessel.

34:46.641 --> 34:48.630
Seen me through some rough waters,

34:48.755 --> 34:51.099
and I don't just mean sailing.

34:51.224 --> 34:53.565
The rules here are simple.

34:53.690 --> 34:56.128
Every man does an equal share,

34:56.161 --> 34:58.710
every man gets an equal
share of the earnings.

34:58.835 --> 35:01.284
What you do on shore
is your own business.

35:01.324 --> 35:03.074
Understood.

35:03.199 --> 35:06.913
You're gonna like it
here, Tom. I can tell.

35:11.945 --> 35:14.893
I looked it up. The man's name
is Dan Seavey. He's a smuggler.

35:14.914 --> 35:17.001
- Where are you going?
- To the docks.

35:17.014 --> 35:19.981
- I believe I know who the killer is.
- Aspetta! I'm coming!

35:20.083 --> 35:22.773
Sir, they may have set sail by
now. How are we gonna catch them?

35:23.969 --> 35:25.365
Sir?

35:32.262 --> 35:35.105
Dan, something's coming for us.

35:42.827 --> 35:44.914
What in blazes is that?

35:45.235 --> 35:46.931
Never seen anything like it.

35:47.056 --> 35:49.900
Well, it's about to be
blown out of the water.

35:49.947 --> 35:52.581
Load the cannons!

35:56.664 --> 35:58.434
What do you think, Tom?

36:05.474 --> 36:07.228
That's my son.

36:09.108 --> 36:11.266
- Your son?
- And my Detective.

36:11.367 --> 36:14.068
- What the bloody hell are they doing?
- Detective?

36:14.369 --> 36:16.780
- You're a cop?
- I was.

36:17.355 --> 36:20.389
Look, tell your lads not
to fire. I'll handle this.

36:20.443 --> 36:23.496
Sorry, Tom. Can't take that chance.

36:25.987 --> 36:27.516
Get him below!

36:27.541 --> 36:30.753
Stay there till I need you! Ready?

36:34.056 --> 36:35.557
Aim!

36:41.885 --> 36:44.478
- Fire!
- Fire!

36:48.527 --> 36:51.472
- Are you all right, John?
- I felt it blow right by my face!

36:51.494 --> 36:53.336
Andiamo!

37:03.387 --> 37:05.362
How the hell are they doing that?

37:13.079 --> 37:14.625
I'll be damned.

37:18.858 --> 37:20.827
Who the hell are you?

37:21.166 --> 37:24.521
Toronto Constabulary.
We're boarding your vessel.

37:26.311 --> 37:27.512
Drop anchor.

37:27.577 --> 37:30.110
- Aye, captain!
- Drop the ladder.

37:34.735 --> 37:36.425
Toss 'em a line.

37:41.023 --> 37:44.005
I didn't let you on board so
you could commandeer my vessel.

37:44.025 --> 37:47.097
- Where's Inspector Brackenreid?
- Tom? I don't know.

37:48.018 --> 37:51.233
I suppose he could be drinking
in the mess or having a nap.

37:51.262 --> 37:53.588
- Where's my father?
- You must be John.

37:53.934 --> 37:56.833
He's talked about you. And your mother.

37:56.880 --> 37:59.581
- If you've hurt him...
- He boarded of his own accord.

38:00.239 --> 38:02.068
What laws are we meant to have broken?

38:02.090 --> 38:04.766
Besides firing a cannon at us?

38:04.987 --> 38:06.730
The murder of Matthew Honeyman.

38:06.746 --> 38:10.833
- Where is the treasure? You swine!
- You were bearing down on us.

38:11.344 --> 38:13.789
We fired in self-defense.
As to the rest of it,

38:13.826 --> 38:15.922
I don't know what either
of you are talking about.

38:15.943 --> 38:17.338
Liar!

38:17.391 --> 38:19.909
You're coming back to
Toronto with us, Mr. Seavey.

38:20.105 --> 38:21.842
No, he's not.

38:23.065 --> 38:25.382
- Sir!
- John?

38:25.425 --> 38:27.494
- Easy.
- John, stay calm.

38:27.527 --> 38:30.239
- Easy, lad. Easy.
- John?

38:30.302 --> 38:34.110
What did you think? You could
just board my ship and get it back?

38:35.202 --> 38:38.603
You two can either leave
my ship alive or dead.

38:38.641 --> 38:41.690
Either way, I'm keeping that boat.

38:43.380 --> 38:46.726
- Let him go, Seavey.
- Look around, Detective.

38:46.768 --> 38:50.061
Not really in a position
to be giving orders, are we?

38:50.097 --> 38:52.255
No, I'll keep him a while.

38:52.356 --> 38:54.201
Tom will be tickled.

38:54.326 --> 38:56.996
Now, I'll give you
till the count of three.

38:57.121 --> 39:00.463
- One, two...
- Seavey!

39:00.809 --> 39:02.375
Let him go,

39:02.543 --> 39:04.871
or else we're all going down,
including the treasure in the hold.

39:04.887 --> 39:08.081
- No! You mustn't!
- You're a lawman, Tom.

39:08.121 --> 39:10.760
We all know you're not
about to murder anyone.

39:10.813 --> 39:12.161
Do you see a badge?

39:12.286 --> 39:14.547
- Now let him go.
- I don't think so.

39:15.146 --> 39:17.612
You see, I'm keeping the treasure

39:17.648 --> 39:20.025
and that sweet little boat.

39:20.253 --> 39:22.949
In exchange, I'll allow you and your men

39:22.987 --> 39:25.277
to get off my ship alive.

39:25.324 --> 39:28.827
Otherwise, your boy doesn't
see his nineteenth birthday.

39:28.869 --> 39:31.605
- The treasure is not for you...
- Shut up, you twit!

39:31.630 --> 39:34.398
- You had your chance.
- You know this man?

39:34.574 --> 39:38.219
- Of course not!
- I'm keeping young John as a...

39:38.344 --> 39:41.461
What do you call it? Uh... Insurance.

39:41.505 --> 39:44.708
I'll mail him back here. Promise.

39:44.833 --> 39:48.277
- Right. We're all going under.
- No!

39:51.451 --> 39:54.867
It was you! That gun...
You killed Matthew Honeyman!

39:54.880 --> 39:57.001
The treasure is mine!

39:57.014 --> 39:59.655
Stop that!

40:17.309 --> 40:19.739
That was a pretty good right hand.

40:20.179 --> 40:22.827
Ow!

40:23.992 --> 40:25.615
Stay down.

40:25.717 --> 40:27.469
Aaaah!

40:31.217 --> 40:34.358
You're under arrest for the
murder of Matthew Honeyman.

40:38.539 --> 40:40.277
No!

40:40.402 --> 40:43.173
I like your boat!

40:43.938 --> 40:47.690
- My motor!
- My treasure!

40:48.806 --> 40:53.003
Later, guys!

40:58.711 --> 41:01.655
You've certainly improved the
spirits of a number of patients.

41:01.668 --> 41:04.050
Moomama always said I
can get through to anyone.

41:04.083 --> 41:06.010
I believe it's because you don't pander.

41:06.057 --> 41:08.565
You have a way of speaking
plainly and succinctly.

41:08.610 --> 41:10.083
It's... it's quite effective.

41:10.119 --> 41:11.679
Does this mean I get to be a nurse now?

41:11.715 --> 41:15.594
I'm afraid it's not that
simple, but if you're serious,

41:15.617 --> 41:17.778
I may be able to find a way
to place you in the hospital

41:17.795 --> 41:20.188
as some sort of... nurse's apprentice.

41:20.289 --> 41:23.351
I see. Thank you.

41:28.492 --> 41:30.753
If this is truly what you want, Ruth,

41:30.800 --> 41:34.094
I believe with enough persistence
you'll eventually become a nurse.

41:35.452 --> 41:39.108
Goodie! Yes! This is
exactly what I want! Oh!

41:39.141 --> 41:41.083
Thank you, Doctor!

41:42.900 --> 41:45.818
So, Pupazzi wasn't actually a detective.

41:45.943 --> 41:49.032
We've just received word from
the Carabinieri in Naples.

41:49.085 --> 41:51.309
They knew who Flavio Pupazzi was,

41:51.329 --> 41:53.135
but not because he's a detective.

41:53.168 --> 41:56.056
Apparently, he has quite
a lengthy criminal record.

41:56.070 --> 41:59.414
So he and Honeyman teamed up
to rob the museum in Naples.

41:59.472 --> 42:02.164
Yes. Then Honeyman
double-crossed him and fled here.

42:02.201 --> 42:05.846
Pupazzi followed him and hired
Dan Seavey to find and steal it.

42:05.971 --> 42:09.643
But by the time Pupazzi catches
up to Honeyman in Toronto,

42:09.818 --> 42:12.451
Honeyman's already given
the treasure to Trammel

42:12.518 --> 42:16.653
- who had it stolen from him by Dan Seavey.
- Correct.

42:17.344 --> 42:19.280
Clear as mud.

42:21.512 --> 42:23.766
Do you think he'll be
back anytime soon, sir?

42:24.688 --> 42:26.605
Let's hope so, George.

42:31.224 --> 42:33.231
I'm sorry I put you through that, son.

42:33.422 --> 42:36.563
These problems are mine. I
didn't want them to affect you.

42:36.666 --> 42:38.842
Having said that, I was very proud

42:38.867 --> 42:40.487
of the way you handled
yourself out there,

42:40.512 --> 42:42.992
the way you stayed calm when you
had that knife at your throat.

42:45.748 --> 42:48.677
- I was scared.
- Of course you were.

42:50.056 --> 42:52.313
Fear will only stop you if you let it.

42:57.405 --> 43:00.306
Mother's gonna be beside herself
when we tell her what happened.

43:09.170 --> 43:10.664
Listen, John.

43:10.766 --> 43:12.666
You'll always be my son.

43:12.768 --> 43:15.481
I would walk to the ends of the
Earth for you and your brother.

43:15.528 --> 43:17.271
There and back.

43:23.371 --> 43:25.179
Take care of your mother.

43:25.280 --> 43:26.905
I mean that.
