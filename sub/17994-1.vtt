00:36.695 --> 00:39.822
Dwarfed by the vast expanse
of the open ocean

00:39.823 --> 00:43.993
the biggest animal
that has ever lived on our planet.

00:50.259 --> 00:54.429
A blue whale, 30 metres long
and weighing over 200 tonnes

00:56.525 --> 01:00.684
It's far bigger
than even the biggest dinosaur

01:01.748 --> 01:04.873
Its tongue weighs as much as an elephant

01:04.875 --> 01:08.002
Its heart is the size of a car

01:08.003 --> 01:12.163
And some of its blood vessels are so wide
that you could swim down them

01:14.269 --> 01:18.429
Its tail alone is the width
of a small aircraft wings

01:38.268 --> 01:42.428
Its streamlining, close to perfection,
enables it to cruise at twenty knots

01:43.491 --> 01:47.651
It's one of the fastest animals in the sea

01:51.832 --> 01:56.002
The ocean's largest inhabitant feeds
Almost exclusively on one of the smallest

01:57.055 --> 02:01.215
krill, a crustacean
just a few centimetres long

02:05.406 --> 02:09.574
Gathered in a shoal,
krill stain the sea red and a single blue

02:09.576 --> 02:13.736
whale in a day
can consume forty million of them

02:23.139 --> 02:27.310
Despite the enormous size of blue whales,
we know very little about them

02:28.362 --> 02:30.447
Their migration
routes are still a mystery and

02:30.448 --> 02:34.607
we have absolutely no idea
where they go to breed

02:38.798 --> 02:41.925
They are a dramatic reminder of how much

02:41.926 --> 02:46.086
we still have to learn about the ocean and
the creatures that live there

02:50.277 --> 02:52.361
Our planet is a blue planet

02:52.362 --> 02:56.522
Over seventy percent of
it is covered by the sea

02:59.670 --> 03:01.754
The Pacific Ocean
alone covers half the globe

03:01.755 --> 03:04.882
You can fly across it non-stop
for twelve hours

03:04.883 --> 03:09.053
and still see nothing
more than a speck of land

03:10.106 --> 03:14.266
This series will reveal the complete
natural history of our ocean planet from

03:15.319 --> 03:19.489
its familiar shores to the mysteries
of its deepest seas

03:32.020 --> 03:36.180
By volume, the ocean makes up 97% of
the earth inhabitable space

03:37.233 --> 03:39.328
And the sheer quantity of marine life

03:39.329 --> 03:43.488
it contains far exceeds that
which inhabits the land

04:07.498 --> 04:09.593
But life in the ocean
is not evenly spread.

04:09.594 --> 04:13.763
It's regulated by the path
of currents carrying nutrients

04:13.764 --> 04:17.923
and the varying power of the sun

04:18.976 --> 04:22.113
In this first programme
we will see how these two forces interact

04:22.115 --> 04:26.274
to control the distribution of life
from the coral seas ...to the polar wastes

05:25.772 --> 05:29.932
The sheer physical power
of the ocean dominates our planet

05:47.687 --> 05:51.856
It profoundly influences
the weather of all the world

05:51.857 --> 05:53.951
Water vapour rising
from it forms the clouds

05:53.952 --> 05:58.112
and generates the storms that ultimately
will drench the land

06:18.994 --> 06:22.121
The great waves
that roar in towards the shores

06:22.122 --> 06:26.292
are dramatic demonstrations of its power

06:39.866 --> 06:44.035
Waves originate far out at sea

06:44.036 --> 06:47.173
There,
even gentle breezes can cause ripples

06:47.174 --> 06:51.334
and ripples grow into swells

06:59.695 --> 07:03.855
Out in the open ocean, unimpeded by land,
such swells can become gigantic

07:28.918 --> 07:32.045
It's only when an ocean swell
eventually reaches shallow water

07:32.046 --> 07:36.205
that it starts to break

07:42.481 --> 07:43.523
As it approaches the coast

07:43.524 --> 07:47.684
the water at the bottom of the swell
is slowed by contact with the sea bed

07:48.747 --> 07:51.874
The top of the swell,
still travelling fast,

07:51.875 --> 07:56.034
starts to roll over
and so the wave breaks

08:28.395 --> 08:29.437
The ocean never rests.

08:29.438 --> 08:32.575
Huge currents, such as the Gulf Stream,

08:32.576 --> 08:36.745
keep its waters constantly
on the move all round the globe

08:36.746 --> 08:38.830
It's these currents
more than any other factor

08:38.831 --> 08:43.001
that control the distribution of
nutrients and life in the seas

08:47.182 --> 08:50.308
A tiny island lost in the midst
of the Pacific

08:50.309 --> 08:52.404
It's the tip of a huge mountain

08:52.405 --> 08:56.565
that rises precipitously from
the sea floor thousands of metres below

09:02.841 --> 09:07.001
The nearest land
is three hundred miles away

09:10.139 --> 09:14.318
Isolated sea mounts
like this one create oases

09:14.319 --> 09:16.403
where life can flourish...

09:16.404 --> 09:20.564
in the comparatively empty expanses
of the open ocean

09:28.925 --> 09:32.052
But all the creatures
that swim beside it would

09:32.053 --> 09:36.223
not be here were it not for
one key factor - the deep ocean currents

09:43.542 --> 09:47.711
Far below the surface they collide with
the island's flanks

09:47.712 --> 09:49.796
and are deflected upwards

09:49.797 --> 09:53.957
bringing with them from the depths
a rich soup of nutrients

09:57.105 --> 10:01.265
Such up-wellings
attract great concentrations of life

10:09.626 --> 10:12.753
Most of the fish here
are permanent residents,

10:12.754 --> 10:16.933
feeding on the plankton, the tiny floating
plants and animals that are nourished

10:16.934 --> 10:20.061
by the richness brought up from the depths

10:20.062 --> 10:24.222
And they in turn,
attract visitors from the open ocean

10:25.285 --> 10:29.445
Tuna.

10:53.455 --> 10:57.625
The plankton feeders are easy targets

11:08.071 --> 11:12.231
All this action attracts
even larger predators...

11:14.327 --> 11:18.497
Sharks!

11:20.592 --> 11:24.761
Hundreds of sharks.

11:24.762 --> 11:28.942
These silky sharks are
normally ocean-going species

11:28.943 --> 11:31.027
but the sea mounts in the eastern Pacific,

11:31.028 --> 11:35.197
like Cocos, Malpelo and the Galapagos,

11:35.198 --> 11:39.369
attract silkies in huge groups
up to five hundred strong

11:43.549 --> 11:46.676
Silkies seem to specialize
in taking injured fish

11:46.677 --> 11:50.847
and constantly circle sea mounts on
the look out for the chance to do so

11:57.113 --> 12:01.283
But Silkies are not the only visitors

12:03.378 --> 12:06.505
Hammerheads gather
in some of the largest shark

12:06.506 --> 12:09.643
shoals to be found anywhere in the ocean

12:09.644 --> 12:13.804
Sometimes thousands will circle
over a single sea mount

12:19.027 --> 12:22.164
But these sharks are not here for food

12:22.165 --> 12:26.325
They have come for another reason

12:28.420 --> 12:32.590
Some of the locals
provide a cleaning service

12:35.729 --> 12:37.813
Following the last El Nino year,

12:37.814 --> 12:39.898
when a rise in water temperatures

12:39.899 --> 12:43.036
caused many sharks to suffer
from fungal infections,

12:43.037 --> 12:47.197
the number of hammerheads visiting the sea
mounts reached record levels

12:58.685 --> 13:02.856
Nutrients also well up to the surface
along the coasts of the continents

13:05.994 --> 13:10.163
This is Natal
on South Africa's eastern seaboard

13:10.164 --> 13:14.334
It's June and just off-shore,
strange black patches have appeared

13:18.515 --> 13:22.674
They look like immense oil
slicks up to a mile long

13:24.780 --> 13:27.907
But this is a living slick

13:27.908 --> 13:31.035
Millions and millions
of sardines on a marine

13:31.036 --> 13:34.173
migration that in terms of sheer biomass

13:34.174 --> 13:38.333
rivals that of the wildebeest
on the grasslands of Africa

13:42.514 --> 13:44.609
These fish live for most of the time

13:44.610 --> 13:46.694
in the cold waters south of the Cape,

13:46.695 --> 13:50.864
but each year the coastal currents reverse

13:50.865 --> 13:51.906
The warm Agulhas current that

13:51.907 --> 13:54.002
usually flows down from the north

13:54.003 --> 13:57.129
has been displaced by cold water
coming up from the south

13:57.130 --> 14:00.257
and that has brought up rich nutrients

14:00.258 --> 14:04.438
They, in turn,
have created a bloom of plankton

14:04.439 --> 14:08.598
- and the sardines are now feasting on it

14:16.960 --> 14:18.001
As the sardines travel north,

14:18.002 --> 14:22.162
a whole caravan of predators follow them

14:26.353 --> 14:29.480
Thousands of Cape Gannets
track the sardines

14:29.481 --> 14:30.522
They nested off the Cape

14:30.523 --> 14:33.650
and timed their breeding so that
their newly-fledged chicks

14:33.651 --> 14:37.821
can join them in pursuing the shoals

14:44.087 --> 14:48.257
Below water, hundreds of sharks
have also joined the caravan

14:52.438 --> 14:54.522
These are Bronze whaler sharks,

14:54.523 --> 14:58.693
a cold water species that normally
lives much further south

15:04.958 --> 15:08.096
These three-metre sharks
cut such great swathes

15:08.097 --> 15:12.256
through the sardine shoals that their
tracks are clearly visible from the air

15:14.352 --> 15:18.531
Harried by packs of predators and
swept in by the action of the waves,

15:18.532 --> 15:22.692
the sardine shoals are penned
close to the shore

15:41.489 --> 15:45.649
Common dolphin are coming in
from the open ocean to join the feast

16:01.318 --> 16:05.478
There are over a thousand of them
in this one school

16:12.797 --> 16:16.957
When they catch up with the sardines,
the action really begins

16:21.148 --> 16:25.307
Working together,
they drive the shoal towards the surface

16:34.711 --> 16:38.871
It is easier for the dolphins
to snatch fish up here

16:52.455 --> 16:56.615
Now the sardines have no escape

17:08.104 --> 17:12.263
Thanks to the dolphins, the sardines have
come within the diving range of the gannets

17:25.848 --> 17:28.975
Hundreds of white arrows shoot
into the sea,

17:28.976 --> 17:33.135
leaving long trails
of bubbles behind each dive

17:44.635 --> 17:48.794
Next to join the frenzy are the sharks

18:01.326 --> 18:04.463
Sharks get very excited
when dolphins are around

18:04.464 --> 18:06.548
That may be because
they can feed particularly...

18:06.549 --> 18:07.591
well once the dolphins have driven

18:07.592 --> 18:11.751
the sardines into more compact
groups near the surface

18:15.942 --> 18:20.102
As the frenzy continues walls of
bubbles drift upwards

18:24.283 --> 18:28.453
They are being released by the dolphins,
working together in teams

18:30.548 --> 18:34.708
They use the bubbles to corral the
sardines into ever tighter groups

18:38.899 --> 18:43.059
The sardines seldom cross the wall of
bubbles and crowd closer together

18:48.293 --> 18:52.452
Bubble netting in this way enables the
dolphins to grab every last trapped sardine

19:06.026 --> 19:09.163
Just when the feasting
seems to be almost over,

19:09.164 --> 19:13.324
a Bryde whale arrives

19:15.420 --> 19:18.557
The survivors head on northwards,

19:18.558 --> 19:22.717
and the caravan of predators follows them

19:30.036 --> 19:32.120
Nutrients can also be brought up

19:32.121 --> 19:34.205
- though less predictably

19:34.206 --> 19:38.366
- - by rough weather

19:41.514 --> 19:42.556
Particularly near the poles,

19:42.557 --> 19:45.684
huge storms stir the depths and

19:45.685 --> 19:47.769
enrich the surface waters and here,

19:47.770 --> 19:51.940
in the South Atlantic,
the seas are the roughest on the planet

19:55.078 --> 19:58.205
And very rich seas they are too, for here,

19:58.206 --> 20:00.300
the cold Falklands current from the South

20:00.301 --> 20:03.428
meets the warm Brazil
current from the North

20:03.429 --> 20:07.589
and at their junction
there is food in abundance

20:09.694 --> 20:12.821
These Black-browed
albatross are duck-diving

20:12.822 --> 20:16.982
for krill that has been driven up
to the surface

20:20.130 --> 20:21.172
Like all albatross,

20:21.173 --> 20:25.333
Black-brows are wanderers
across the face of the open ocean

20:41.002 --> 20:45.171
A feeding assembly on this scale
is a rare sight

20:45.172 --> 20:46.214
Most of the time,

20:46.215 --> 20:49.341
the birds of the open sea
are widely dispersed

20:49.342 --> 20:53.522
But these feeding grounds are close
to an albatross breeding colony

20:53.523 --> 20:57.683
- and a very special one

21:06.044 --> 21:10.204
This is Steeple Jason, a remote island
in the far west of the Falklands

21:11.257 --> 21:15.427
It has the largest albatross
colony in the world

21:23.788 --> 21:25.872
There are almost half a million
albatross here

21:25.873 --> 21:29.000
an astonishing demonstration of

21:29.001 --> 21:31.085
how fertile the ocean can be

21:31.086 --> 21:35.256
and how much food it can give even to
creatures that do not actually live in it

22:03.436 --> 22:07.606
Nutrients by themselves are not enough to
generate these vast assemblies.

22:08.659 --> 22:10.743
The heat and light
that the sun brings everyday

22:10.744 --> 22:14.924
is also essential for the growth of
the microscopic floating plants

22:14.925 --> 22:19.085
- the phytoplankton

22:22.223 --> 22:24.307
And it the phytoplankton

22:24.308 --> 22:28.478
that is the basis of all life in the ocean

22:33.701 --> 22:35.796
Every evening,
the disappearance of the sun

22:35.797 --> 22:38.923
below the horizon triggers the largest

22:38.924 --> 22:43.084
migration of life
that takes place on our planet

22:50.403 --> 22:53.529
One thousand million tones
of sea creatures

22:53.530 --> 22:57.701
ascend from the deep ocean to
search for food near the surface

23:06.051 --> 23:10.231
They graze on the phytoplankton
under cover of darkness

23:10.232 --> 23:13.359
Even so, they are far from safe

23:13.360 --> 23:15.444
Other marine hunters follow them,

23:15.445 --> 23:19.615
some travelling up
from hundreds of metres below

24:20.156 --> 24:24.315
At dawn, the whole procession returns
to the safety of the dark depths

24:32.677 --> 24:36.836
The moon too has a great
influence on life in the oceans

24:38.932 --> 24:43.102
Its gravitational pull creates the daily
advance and retreat of the tides

24:56.676 --> 24:59.803
But the moon has
more than a daily cycle

24:59.804 --> 25:03.974
Each month it waxes and wanes
as it travels around the earth,

25:05.027 --> 25:09.186
and this monthly cycle also
triggers events in the ocean

25:13.377 --> 25:17.547
The Pacific Coast of Costa Rica
on a very special night

25:17.548 --> 25:21.707
It just after midnight
and the tide is coming in

25:25.898 --> 25:29.025
The moon is in its last quarter,

25:29.026 --> 25:33.186
exactly half way between full and new

25:35.292 --> 25:39.461
For weeks the beach has been empty
But that is about to change

25:39.462 --> 25:43.622
At high tide,
turtles start to emerge from the surf

25:49.898 --> 25:54.058
At first they come in ones and twos,
but within a hour,

25:55.121 --> 25:59.281
they are appearing all along the beach

26:04.514 --> 26:07.641
They are all female Ridley turtles

26:07.642 --> 26:09.726
and over the next six days or so

26:09.727 --> 26:12.854
four hundred thousand
will visit this one beach

26:12.855 --> 26:17.025
to lay their eggs in the sand

26:23.291 --> 26:27.461
At the peak time, five thousand
are coming and going every hour

26:28.514 --> 26:30.598
The top of the beach gets so crowded that

26:30.599 --> 26:34.768
they have to clamber over one
another to find a bare patch

26:34.769 --> 26:38.939
where they can dig a nest hole

26:42.077 --> 26:44.161
A quarter of the world population

26:44.162 --> 26:47.299
of Ridley turtles come to this one beach

26:47.300 --> 26:50.427
on a few key nights each year

26:50.428 --> 26:53.555
The rest of the time, they are widely
distributed through the ocean

26:53.556 --> 26:57.726
searching for food, most
-a hundreds of miles away from here

26:58.779 --> 27:01.905
This mass nesting is called an arribada

27:01.906 --> 27:03.991
How it is co-ordinated is a mystery

27:03.992 --> 27:07.129
- but we do know that's arribadas start

27:07.130 --> 27:11.289
when the moon is either in its first
or its last quarter

27:19.651 --> 27:23.820
Forty million eggs
are laid in just a few days

27:23.821 --> 27:25.905
By synchronising their nesting in this way

27:25.906 --> 27:29.043
the females ensure that six weeks later

27:29.044 --> 27:32.171
their hatchlings
will emerge in such enormous...

27:32.172 --> 27:34.256
numbers that predators on the beach

27:34.257 --> 27:37.383
are overwhelmed
and a significant proportion

27:37.384 --> 27:41.554
of the baby turtles will get past them
and make it to the water

27:44.693 --> 27:46.777
But why do the females
use a cue from the moon

27:46.778 --> 27:49.915
to help in synchronising their nesting?

27:49.916 --> 27:54.075
Part of the answer to that becomes clear
at dawn on the following morning

28:17.043 --> 28:21.213
The day shift of predators are arriving
for their first meals

28:27.479 --> 28:29.563
Vultures have learnt
that the returning tide

28:29.564 --> 28:33.734
can wash freshly laid eggs out of the sand

28:36.872 --> 28:38.956
The risk of eggs being exposed by the surf

28:38.957 --> 28:42.094
may be part of the reason
why turtle arribadas

28:42.095 --> 28:46.255
tend to occur around the last
or first quarter of the moon

28:50.435 --> 28:54.615
It's on such days as this,
when the moon is neither full nor new,

28:54.616 --> 28:58.776
that the tides are weakest and
the sea is likely to be calmer

29:13.403 --> 29:17.572
So at these times,
it easier for the female turtles

29:17.573 --> 29:19.657
to make their way through the surf

29:19.658 --> 29:20.700
and there less chance of their eggs

29:20.701 --> 29:24.871
being washed out of the sand
and being taken by the vultures

29:36.360 --> 29:40.529
The moon monthly cycle
and its influence on the tides triggers

29:40.530 --> 29:44.709
many events in the ocean,
from the spawning of the corals

29:44.710 --> 29:48.880
on the Great Barrier reef
to the breeding cycles of fish

29:48.881 --> 29:50.965
But there an even longer rhythm

29:50.966 --> 29:53.050
that has the most profound effect of all

29:53.051 --> 29:57.221
- the annual cycle of the sun

30:00.359 --> 30:02.443
The sun position relative
to the earth changes

30:02.444 --> 30:06.624
through the year and
it this that produces the seasons

30:06.625 --> 30:10.784
In the north, spring comes as the sun
begins to rise higher in the sky

30:13.922 --> 30:16.017
Off the coast of North West America,

30:16.018 --> 30:20.178
the seas are transformed by the increasing
strength of the sunshine

30:25.411 --> 30:28.538
Here in Alaska the coastal waters turn

30:28.539 --> 30:32.699
green with a sudden bloom of phytoplankton

30:35.847 --> 30:38.974
Herring that have spent
the winter far out to sea,

30:38.975 --> 30:42.101
time their return to the shallow waters
to coincide with this bloom

30:42.102 --> 30:45.229
They come in vast numbers and initiate

30:45.230 --> 30:49.400
one of the most productive
food chains in all the oceans

31:05.059 --> 31:09.239
Humpback whales are at the top
of that food chain

31:09.240 --> 31:13.409
They have spent the winter breeding
in the warmer tropical waters off Hawaii

31:13.410 --> 31:15.494
But there was little food for them there

31:15.495 --> 31:19.665
This herring bonanza provides the vast
majority of their food for the year

31:43.675 --> 31:46.802
Stellar and Californian sea lions

31:46.803 --> 31:50.973
also return from the open ocean
each year to feast off the herring

32:02.462 --> 32:05.588
The herring themselves,
however, have not come here for food

32:05.589 --> 32:08.716
They are about to breed

32:08.717 --> 32:12.887
Nothing deters them as they head
for even shallower waters

32:14.983 --> 32:17.067
Now the waters
are so shallow that glaucous

32:17.068 --> 32:21.238
-winged gulls are able to snatch live fish
from just below the surface

32:33.769 --> 32:35.854
In spite of these attacks and losses,

32:35.855 --> 32:37.939
the herring swim on until

32:37.940 --> 32:40.024
they reach the vegetation that the females

32:40.025 --> 32:44.195
need if they are to lay

32:48.376 --> 32:52.555
Each female produces
around twenty thousand eggs

32:52.556 --> 32:56.716
- and they every sticky

32:58.811 --> 33:00.896
The males arrive soon after the females

33:00.897 --> 33:05.067
have spawned and release their sperm
in vast milky clouds

33:10.290 --> 33:14.469
Soon the excesses
of the herrings' sexual spree

33:14.470 --> 33:18.630
creates a thick, white scum on the surface

33:19.683 --> 33:23.853
Through the season curds of sperm clog
the shores for hundreds of miles,

33:24.906 --> 33:29.066
from British Columbia in the South
all the way to Alaska in the north

33:36.385 --> 33:38.469
After a few days this gigantic spawning

33:38.470 --> 33:42.639
comes to an end and the herring head
back out to deeper waters,

33:42.640 --> 33:45.777
leaving behind them
fertilised eggs plastered...

33:45.778 --> 33:49.938
on every rock and strand of vegetation

34:01.427 --> 34:03.511
They time their spawning
so that two weeks later,

34:03.512 --> 34:05.606
when these eggs start to hatch,

34:05.607 --> 34:07.691
the annual plankton bloom
will have reached

34:07.692 --> 34:09.775
its height and the new-born fish fry

34:09.777 --> 34:11.862
will have plenty to eat

34:11.862 --> 34:15.000
But in the meantime,
all these eggs provide food

34:15.001 --> 34:19.159
for armies of different animals both below
and above the surface

34:27.522 --> 34:31.690
Millions of birds arrive to collect
a share of the herring bounty

34:31.692 --> 34:33.775
Some of it is easily gathered,

34:33.777 --> 34:37.947
for millions of eggs have been
washed up onto the shore

34:39.000 --> 34:43.159
This encapsulated energy is particularly
valuable to migrating birds

34:45.255 --> 34:47.350
These surfbirds are on their way

34:47.351 --> 34:50.476
to their breeding grounds in the Arctic

34:50.478 --> 34:51.520
and they have to come down to refuel

34:51.521 --> 34:55.681
Stranded herring eggs
are just what they need

34:57.787 --> 35:01.946
Bonaparte gulls collect the eggs
just below the surface of the water

35:05.085 --> 35:09.264
Further out in the bay,
huge flocks of ducks have gathered

35:09.265 --> 35:11.349
They are mostly surf scoters

35:11.350 --> 35:15.510
- diving ducks - that can feed off
the bottom several metres down

35:19.701 --> 35:21.785
There are such huge quantities of eggs

35:21.786 --> 35:24.913
that even such a big animal as a bear

35:24.914 --> 35:29.084
finds it worthwhile to collect them

35:31.179 --> 35:34.306
The spawning of the herring
is a crucial event

35:34.307 --> 35:37.434
in the lives of many animals
all along the coast

35:37.435 --> 35:40.572
The whole event coincides
with the plankton bloom

35:40.573 --> 35:44.733
and within just three short weeks
it all over

35:49.966 --> 35:54.126
The migratory birds leave
to continue their journey north

36:02.487 --> 36:06.647
They will not come back until
the herring also return next year

36:12.923 --> 36:15.007
As the herring spawning finishes,

36:15.008 --> 36:19.168
other migrants are starting
to arrive just offshore

36:21.274 --> 36:25.433
Grey whales

36:27.529 --> 36:29.613
They have followed the sun north

36:29.614 --> 36:31.709
and they too are seeking the food

36:31.710 --> 36:35.869
that is generated by
the bloom of the phytoplankton

36:39.007 --> 36:43.187
Krill are feeding off it and these
whales are feeding on the krill,

36:43.188 --> 36:46.315
skimming it from the surface
with the filter plates of baleen

36:46.316 --> 36:50.475
that hang from their upper jaws

36:52.581 --> 36:54.665
Grey whales make one
of the longest migrations

36:54.666 --> 36:56.751
undertaken by any marine mammal

36:56.752 --> 36:59.878
- a round trip of 12,000 miles or

36:59.879 --> 37:01.974
so from their breeding grounds off Mexico

37:01.975 --> 37:05.101
along the entire coast of North America

37:05.102 --> 37:09.262
right up to the Arctic ocean

37:10.315 --> 37:12.410
They travel close to the coast
with the males

37:12.411 --> 37:16.580
and non-breeding females leading the way

37:16.581 --> 37:19.707
The last to start are the cows
that have just given birth

37:19.708 --> 37:21.792
They have to wait until
their new-born calves

37:21.793 --> 37:25.964
are sufficiently big and strong to tackle
such an immense journey

37:29.102 --> 37:32.228
Their progress is necessarily slow

37:32.229 --> 37:34.324
The mothers must stay
alongside their young

37:34.325 --> 37:38.485
and even a strong calf can only travel
at a couple of knots

37:39.538 --> 37:41.622
They stick even closer to the shore

37:41.623 --> 37:45.793
often within just 200 metres

37:48.931 --> 37:51.015
Killer whales.

37:51.016 --> 37:55.186
They have learnt that grey whales
follow traditional routes

37:56.239 --> 37:58.323
The killers have no trouble in overtaking

37:58.324 --> 38:02.484
a calf and its devoted mother

38:05.633 --> 38:07.717
Normally,
they continually call to one another,

38:07.718 --> 38:10.844
but now they have fallen silent

38:10.845 --> 38:15.005
The mother grey whale and her calf
have no idea that they have been targeted

38:37.983 --> 38:42.152
Catching up with the grey whales
is the easy part for the killers

38:42.153 --> 38:44.237
They have to be cautious
for they are only...

38:44.238 --> 38:48.408
about half the size
of the grey whale mother

38:50.504 --> 38:54.663
She can inflict real damage with her tail

39:03.025 --> 39:07.204
But the killers are not after her
They are after her calf

39:07.205 --> 39:09.289
As long as the mother
can keep it on the move,

39:09.290 --> 39:13.450
it will be safe and
she does her best to hurry it along

39:16.588 --> 39:18.683
At first the killers
avoid getting too close...

39:18.684 --> 39:21.810
to the mother but just keep pace alongside

39:21.811 --> 39:22.853
They know that the calf,

39:22.854 --> 39:27.014
going at this speed, will eventually tire

39:36.417 --> 39:39.554
After three hours
of being harried in this way

39:39.555 --> 39:42.682
the calf becomes too exhausted
to swim any further

39:42.683 --> 39:45.810
The mother has to stop

39:45.811 --> 39:48.948
This is the moment the killers
have been waiting for

39:48.949 --> 39:53.109
They start to try and force themselves
between mother and calf

40:15.033 --> 40:17.117
A calf, separated from its mother,

40:17.118 --> 40:19.202
will not be able to defend itself

40:19.203 --> 40:21.298
Time and again the black fins

40:21.299 --> 40:25.459
of the killers appear between
the mottled backs of the grey whales

40:36.948 --> 40:39.032
At last the killers succeed

40:39.033 --> 40:43.203
And now that they've got the calf
on its own, they change their tactics

40:44.256 --> 40:48.416
They leap right on to the calf
and try to push it under

40:59.904 --> 41:04.075
They are trying to drown it

41:11.383 --> 41:15.553
The calf snatches a desperate breath

41:28.084 --> 41:31.211
The mother becomes increasingly agitated

41:31.212 --> 41:33.307
Frantically,
she tries to push her calf back

41:33.308 --> 41:37.467
to the surface so that it can breathe

41:40.605 --> 41:44.776
But now it is so exhausted that it has
to be supported by its mother's body

42:03.562 --> 42:04.614
The killers won't give up

42:04.615 --> 42:08.775
Like a pack of wolves,
they take turns in harassing the whales

42:31.742 --> 42:35.902
Now the whole pod is involved

42:45.306 --> 42:49.476
One of them takes a bite

42:59.922 --> 43:04.091
Soon the sea is reddened
with the calf's blood

43:04.092 --> 43:08.263
and the killers close in for the final act

43:29.145 --> 43:33.305
The calf is dead

43:35.400 --> 43:39.570
After a six-hour hunt, the killer whales
have finally won their prize

43:46.878 --> 43:51.049
The mother, bereft, has to continue
her migration north on her own

43:57.314 --> 44:00.451
She leaves behind the carcass
of a calf that

44:00.452 --> 44:03.579
she cherished
for thirteen months in her womb

44:03.580 --> 44:07.740
for which she delayed
her own journey to find food

44:10.888 --> 44:15.048
The pod of fifteen killer whales spent
over six hours trying to kill this calf

44:16.101 --> 44:18.185
But now, having succeeded,

44:18.186 --> 44:22.356
they have eaten nothing
more than its lower jaw and its tongue

44:30.717 --> 44:34.877
Valuable food like this will not
go to waste in the ocean

44:35.930 --> 44:40.090
Before long the carcass will sink
to the very bottom of this deep sea

44:41.153 --> 44:45.313
But even there,
its flesh will not be wasted

44:47.409 --> 44:51.588
Over a mile down in the
total darkness of the deep ocean

44:51.589 --> 44:55.758
- the body of another grey whale,
a thirty ton adult

44:55.759 --> 44:59.919
It settled here only a few weeks ago

45:00.972 --> 45:05.142
Already,
it has attracted hundreds of hagfish

45:11.408 --> 45:13.503
These scavengers, over half a metre long

45:13.504 --> 45:17.673
and as thick as your arm,
are only found in the deep sea

45:17.674 --> 45:20.800
They have been attracted
by the faint whiff of

45:20.801 --> 45:24.972
decay suffusing through the water
for miles around

45:29.152 --> 45:31.236
With their heads buried
in the whale's flesh,

45:31.237 --> 45:35.407
they breathe through gill openings
along the sides of their bodies

45:36.460 --> 45:38.544
They're very primitive creatures

45:38.545 --> 45:41.672
- not even true fish, for they lack jaws.

45:41.673 --> 45:44.810
- They feed, not by biting, but by

45:44.811 --> 45:48.971
rasping off flesh
with two rows of horny teeth

45:50.024 --> 45:51.065
In just a few hours,

45:51.066 --> 45:55.237
a hagfish can eat several times
its own weight of rotting flesh

46:00.460 --> 46:04.620
Next to arrive - a sleeper shark

46:09.853 --> 46:12.980
It moves so slowly to conserve energy

46:12.981 --> 46:15.075
- an important strategy for so large

46:15.076 --> 46:19.236
an animal surviving in such a poor habitat

46:25.512 --> 46:28.639
Sleeper sharks live over a mile down

46:28.640 --> 46:32.800
and grow to over seven metres long

46:33.853 --> 46:36.990
They can go for months without food,

46:36.991 --> 46:41.160
slowly cruising along the bottom,
waiting for rare bonanzas,

46:41.161 --> 46:45.321
such as this one, to arrive from above

46:51.597 --> 46:54.723
A whole range of different
deep-sea scavengers

46:54.724 --> 46:57.861
will feast on this carcass for a long time

46:57.862 --> 47:02.022
before all its nutriment has been consumed

47:03.075 --> 47:07.235
Eighteen months later, all that is left
is a perfect skeleton, stripped bare

47:12.468 --> 47:13.510
The sun's energy that was captured

47:13.511 --> 47:16.638
and turned into living tissue
by the floating

47:16.639 --> 47:18.733
phytoplankton has been transferred from

47:18.734 --> 47:20.818
one link to another in the food chain

47:20.819 --> 47:23.946
and has ended up as far away from the sun

47:23.947 --> 47:26.031
as it is possible to be on this planet

47:26.032 --> 47:29.169
- at the bottom of the deep sea

47:29.170 --> 47:33.330
But some energy also returns from the deep

47:39.606 --> 47:43.766
Millions of opalescent squid are
on their way to the shallows

47:45.861 --> 47:46.903
They have come up here to mate

47:46.904 --> 47:51.074
As the males grab the females,
their tentacles flush red

47:54.212 --> 47:55.253
For most of the year these squid

47:55.254 --> 47:58.381
live at a depth of around 500 metres

47:58.382 --> 48:02.562
They only come together in these great
breeding schools for a few weeks

48:02.563 --> 48:06.722
Just one school was estimated to contain
animals that weigh around 4000 tonnes

48:21.349 --> 48:23.433
Wave after wave rise from the depths

48:23.434 --> 48:25.519
and soon the seabed
in the shallows is strewn

48:25.520 --> 48:29.679
with dense patches of egg capsules
several metres across

48:35.955 --> 48:39.082
As each female adds
another capsule to the pile

48:39.083 --> 48:43.253
the males fight to fertilise its contents

48:58.912 --> 49:00.996
The squid make their huge journey

49:00.997 --> 49:03.092
into the shallows because their eggs

49:03.093 --> 49:06.220
will develop faster
in the warmer water here

49:06.221 --> 49:08.305
and when the young emerge,
they will find more

49:08.306 --> 49:12.465
food more easily than
they would in the ocean depths

49:17.699 --> 49:21.859
Dawn the next morning and the seabed for
miles around is covered in egg capsules.

49:25.007 --> 49:27.091
The squid themselves have all gone

49:27.092 --> 49:31.252
Many will have died, but some will have
returned to their home in the deep

49:32.305 --> 49:34.400
They will not return
to the light of the sun

49:34.401 --> 49:38.560
until the next time they are driven up
by the urge to spawn

49:39.305 --> 49:45.789
