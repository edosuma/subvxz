<b>Homecoming x And x True Name</b>

01:30.140 --> 01:32.920
<b>With the death of King Meruem,</b>

01:32.920 --> 01:35.990
<b>the battle between Chimera Ants 
and humans was over.</b>

01:37.090 --> 01:49.240
<b>Republic of Rokario 

NGL Autonomous Region</b>

<b>Hass Republic</b>

01:37.090 --> 01:49.240
<b>Republic of East Gorteau    Republic of West Gorteau</b>

01:37.300 --> 01:41.220
<b>The Republic of East Gorteau and 
the NGL were tentatively placed</b>

01:41.220 --> 01:45.030
<b>under control of international peacekeepers,</b>

01:45.030 --> 01:47.350
<b>and the nations essentially ceased to exist.</b>

01:48.370 --> 01:50.050
<b>Between the two former nations,</b>

01:50.050 --> 01:53.600
<b>five million survivors were declared refugees.</b>

01:53.980 --> 01:56.710
<b>The Mitene Union's three remaining members</b>

01:56.710 --> 02:00.740
<b>divided East Gorteau's riches and agreed</b>

02:00.740 --> 02:04.830
<b>to jointly govern the former nation's territory.</b>

02:05.820 --> 02:07.950
<b>As for the NGL,</b>

02:08.430 --> 02:11.960
<b>there was a proposal to give all open land</b>

02:11.960 --> 02:16.670
<b>permanent designation as nature reserves, 
to prevent future incidents.</b>

02:16.670 --> 02:18.780
<b>And the international community concurred.</b>

02:20.670 --> 02:23.730
<b>It was agreed that the nature reserves would be</b>

02:23.730 --> 02:27.160
<b>under the Hunter Association's jurisdiction.</b>

02:38.020 --> 02:39.680
<b>Are you sure about this?</b>

02:40.770 --> 02:44.930
<b>Yeah, I'm gonna live here.</b>

02:47.580 --> 02:50.940
<b>The name "Gyro" doesn't mean anything to me.</b>

02:51.830 --> 02:53.760
<b>But this place feels very familiar.</b>

02:58.670 --> 03:04.530
<b>I'm guessing that I was an NGL resident 
that didn't work for Gyro...</b>

03:06.310 --> 03:09.460
<b>Well, I won't force you to come, then.</b>

03:10.910 --> 03:13.490
<b>This is probably safer than other countries now.</b>

03:14.600 --> 03:16.270
<b>Exactly.</b>

03:16.610 --> 03:20.710
<b>One look at me, and the peacekeepers 
would freeze on the spot.</b>

03:21.890 --> 03:23.050
<b>Is that</b>

03:25.150 --> 03:28.760
<b>why she's staying?</b>

03:33.920 --> 03:37.580
<b>No, in her case...</b>

03:38.260 --> 03:40.610
<b>She seems more like you guys.</b>

03:41.650 --> 03:43.100
<b>What do you mean?</b>

03:43.100 --> 03:45.500
<b>Hey! Aren't you done?</b>

03:45.500 --> 03:46.840
<b>We'll leave you behind!</b>

03:46.840 --> 03:49.480
<b>Damn, she's annoying... Give me a minute!</b>

03:50.090 --> 03:55.880
<b>Well, people like me who barely 
remember our previous lives</b>

03:56.310 --> 04:02.380
<b>can tell that people like you and Hina, 
who have their memories, are different.</b>

04:03.130 --> 04:05.260
<b>There's something in your eyes.</b>

04:05.890 --> 04:08.010
<b>Or it's how you look into the distance.</b>

04:08.500 --> 04:11.640
<b>Somehow, I can tell at once.</b>

04:12.040 --> 04:15.250
<b>"This guy remembers his past."</b>

04:17.060 --> 04:19.020
<b>And I can tell that</b>

04:19.830 --> 04:22.040
<b>she remembers her past.</b>

04:24.200 --> 04:28.300
<b>Hina said she'll never talk to us...</b>

04:29.550 --> 04:32.140
<b>But I don't think it's that she won't talk.</b>

04:32.670 --> 04:34.720
<b>It's that she can't talk.</b>

04:38.920 --> 04:40.880
<b>She's probably just a kid.</b>

04:41.620 --> 04:44.050
<b>Welfin!</b>

04:44.380 --> 04:47.020
<b>Zip it! I get the idea!</b>

04:47.510 --> 04:48.800
<b>See ya.</b>

04:49.960 --> 04:54.270
<b>We probably won't see each 
other again, so take care.</b>

04:58.310 --> 04:59.340
<b>Yeah.</b>

05:00.800 --> 05:04.360
<b>Try not to die until you're dead.</b>

05:04.360 --> 05:05.820
<b>The hell is that?</b>

05:07.220 --> 05:08.980
<b>Gyro's way of saying goodbye.</b>

05:10.150 --> 05:13.200
<b>It's one of my favorite phrases.</b>

05:16.820 --> 05:18.370
<b>Did you just remember something?</b>

05:18.700 --> 05:21.600
<b>No... I just kinda like the phrase.</b>

05:21.600 --> 05:22.790
<b>Oh.</b>

05:22.790 --> 05:25.260
<b>So life is what you make of it, huh?</b>

05:27.050 --> 05:28.080
<b>Later.</b>

05:28.570 --> 05:29.480
<b>Yeah.</b>

05:43.980 --> 05:46.490
<b>Well, let's get going.</b>

06:02.220 --> 06:06.620
<b>Okay! It's time to go look for Gyro-sama!</b>

06:07.730 --> 06:10.510
<b>Seriously, you have no shame.</b>

06:10.910 --> 06:14.770
<b>Not so long ago, it was 
"Hagya-sama" this, "Leol-sama" that.</b>

06:15.020 --> 06:16.770
<b>Who's that?</b>

06:17.000 --> 06:18.030
<b>Huh?</b>

06:18.930 --> 06:21.520
<b>No point in thinking about the dead.</b>

06:21.850 --> 06:23.360
<b>I have to move forward!</b>

06:23.360 --> 06:25.330
<b>Straight ahead!</b>

06:28.750 --> 06:33.110
<b>Still... Are you sure we can 
make it through the port?</b>

06:34.120 --> 06:37.180
<b>Yeah, this is a government vehicle,</b>

06:37.180 --> 06:39.790
<b>so once I show my card, they'll let us pass.</b>

06:41.630 --> 06:44.760
<b>Soon, I'll be a resident of Meteor City...</b>

06:45.330 --> 06:47.020
<b>How far I've fallen.</b>

06:49.380 --> 06:51.870
<b>Don't be so negative about it.</b>

06:57.070 --> 06:58.970
<b>Just be patient.</b>

07:00.410 --> 07:03.410
<b>I'm sure that Gyro's also headed there.</b>

07:05.660 --> 07:07.190
<b>It's possible that</b>

07:07.920 --> 07:10.500
<b>he's already gathered all the sympathizers</b>

07:10.500 --> 07:13.440
<b>and tools we'll need to build our own nation.</b>

07:13.440 --> 07:15.080
<b>Which means...</b>

07:15.670 --> 07:19.330
<b>In no time, we'll be back on top!</b>

07:19.490 --> 07:21.580
<b>Yay!</b>

07:23.990 --> 07:28.770
<b>You're so optimistic, I can only envy you.</b>

07:28.770 --> 07:29.870
<b>Optimistic?</b>

07:30.200 --> 07:31.820
<b>You've got that right.</b>

07:31.820 --> 07:33.940
<b>I've already died twice...</b>

07:34.270 --> 07:36.220
<b>But I'm still alive!</b>

07:36.540 --> 07:38.760
<b>Nothing scares me now.</b>

07:38.760 --> 07:40.230
<b>I'm ready for anything!</b>

07:41.390 --> 07:42.400
<b>Plus,</b>

07:43.060 --> 07:45.610
<b>I'm the one who stopped the King.</b>

07:46.880 --> 07:48.360
<b>H-Hey...</b>

07:52.400 --> 07:56.960
<b>Yeah, I'm a class-A political criminal.</b>

07:57.420 --> 08:01.000
<b>Might as well enjoy whatever is left of my life.</b>

08:01.240 --> 08:02.850
<b>Yeah, that's the spirit.</b>

08:03.300 --> 08:05.870
<b>Humans are alive until they're dead!</b>

08:05.870 --> 08:08.030
<b>What? You're stating the obvious!</b>

08:08.030 --> 08:09.250
<b>Quiet!</b>

08:10.580 --> 08:16.940
<b>Welfin, Hina, and Bizeff head to 
Meteor City, in search of Gyro.</b>

08:29.660 --> 08:31.190
<b>Is that the village?</b>

08:32.430 --> 08:33.240
<b>Hey...</b>

08:44.070 --> 08:45.670
<b>Don't worry.</b>

08:48.210 --> 08:49.710
<b>I'm with you.</b>

09:21.060 --> 09:22.540
<b>Monsters!</b>

09:34.150 --> 09:36.000
<b>Well, that's to be expected.</b>

09:42.770 --> 09:44.530
<b>Hey!</b>

09:44.530 --> 09:46.950
<b>People of NGL!</b>

09:46.950 --> 09:51.180
<b>I need someone who can communicate</b>

09:51.180 --> 09:53.580
<b>in a peaceful and reasonable manner!</b>

09:53.580 --> 09:56.700
<b>I'm not here to harm anyone!</b>

09:57.390 --> 10:00.700
<b>I just have a question to ask!</b>

10:10.760 --> 10:13.710
<b>Hey! You can speak?</b>

10:14.310 --> 10:15.710
<b>Who are you?</b>

10:16.200 --> 10:18.470
<b>Uh...</b>

10:19.040 --> 10:23.720
<b>This will probably be hard to believe, 
but will you hear me out?</b>

10:28.780 --> 10:31.110
<b>You're the only people I can turn to!</b>

11:50.760 --> 11:51.750
<b>Reina?</b>

11:53.390 --> 11:54.430
<b>How did...</b>

11:57.400 --> 11:58.760
<b>you know?</b>

12:09.510 --> 12:10.330
<b>Reina...</b>

12:14.870 --> 12:15.750
<b>Reina...</b>

12:16.370 --> 12:18.620
<b>Reina!</b>

12:20.780 --> 12:22.750
<b>How did you know?</b>

12:22.750 --> 12:24.060
<b>Of course I knew...</b>

12:24.060 --> 12:27.830
<b>I'm your mother! I'm your mother, Reina!</b>

12:31.240 --> 12:32.610
<b>Welcome home.</b>

12:33.650 --> 12:35.690
<b>I'm so glad you're back.</b>

12:37.790 --> 12:42.150
<b>Brother tried to protect me!</b>

12:42.670 --> 12:46.660
<b>He told the monster to go away,</b>

12:47.440 --> 12:51.520
<b>and told me to run... He kept me safe!</b>

12:51.520 --> 12:57.000
<b>But I was too scared to move!</b>

12:57.000 --> 12:59.600
<b>I'm sorry!</b>

13:01.800 --> 13:03.980
<b>It's okay... I'm sorry.</b>

13:04.420 --> 13:07.330
<b>You and Kurt did your best.</b>

13:08.090 --> 13:11.740
<b>I'm sorry I wasn't there with you.</b>

13:12.340 --> 13:15.710
<b>I'm sorry I couldn't keep you safe...</b>

13:17.950 --> 13:20.420
<b>Welcome home, Reina-chan.</b>

13:23.150 --> 13:24.850
<b>You must be hungry.</b>

13:25.440 --> 13:27.520
<b>Let's eat together.</b>

13:36.490 --> 13:37.830
<b>Hey...</b>

13:38.380 --> 13:40.490
<b>Why don't you join us?</b>

13:42.290 --> 13:44.730
<b>No... I'll pass.</b>

13:45.360 --> 13:47.610
<b>Don't say that.</b>

13:47.610 --> 13:50.100
<b>You saved Reina-chan.</b>

13:50.490 --> 13:53.310
<b>Please let us feed you.</b>

13:53.310 --> 13:56.010
<b>That isn't what I was doing...</b>

13:56.640 --> 13:57.850
<b>See ya.</b>

14:05.520 --> 14:06.610
<b><i>Damn...</i></b>

14:07.300 --> 14:09.760
<b><i>I've returned the favor, okay?</i></b>

14:13.680 --> 14:16.370
<b><i>Damn that stupid octopus!</i></b>

14:16.370 --> 14:19.250
<b><i>He never should've let me live!</i></b>

14:42.600 --> 14:44.000
<b>Thank you...</b>

14:47.480 --> 14:48.650
<b>Let's eat.</b>

14:49.790 --> 14:51.130
<b>Let's eat</b>

14:52.690 --> 14:53.950
<b>together.</b>

15:03.610 --> 15:04.770
<b><i>Huh?</i></b>

15:04.770 --> 15:06.350
<b><i>What's going on?</i></b>

15:06.350 --> 15:09.930
<b><i>What... What's wrong?</i></b>

15:13.450 --> 15:17.300
<b>Reina and Brovada return home.</b>

15:24.890 --> 15:26.800
<b>Hello? Is this Colt?</b>

15:26.800 --> 15:27.690
<b>It's me.</b>

15:28.710 --> 15:32.700
<b>The politicians have turned this 
into an international crisis.</b>

15:33.750 --> 15:37.200
<b>The Ants are no longer involved.</b>

15:37.790 --> 15:39.490
<b>No longer involved?</b>

15:40.030 --> 15:41.960
<b>Is that actually possible?</b>

15:42.540 --> 15:44.720
<b>That's what politicians do.</b>

15:45.240 --> 15:48.730
<b>You'll be classified as a new Magical Beast.</b>

15:48.730 --> 15:50.170
<b>Magical Beast...</b>

15:50.730 --> 15:54.900
<b>Well, if they label you as a good 
Magical Beast, you'll be fine.</b>

15:56.140 --> 15:58.100
<b>Any changes on your side?</b>

15:58.660 --> 16:01.750
<b>Actually, something has been bothering me.</b>

16:02.740 --> 16:03.920
<b>Something bothering you?</b>

16:04.520 --> 16:07.180
<b>Yeah, it's Reina.</b>

16:07.180 --> 16:10.540
<b>No! You're wrong!</b>

16:11.130 --> 16:13.240
<b>She keeps saying her name isn't Reina.</b>

16:13.730 --> 16:15.280
<b>What is it, then?</b>

16:16.470 --> 16:19.120
<b>I'm not Reina!</b>

16:19.580 --> 16:21.870
<b>My name</b>

16:22.640 --> 16:24.380
<b>is Kite!</b>

16:32.350 --> 16:33.600
<b>Gon!</b>

16:33.600 --> 16:35.010
<b>Killua!</b>

16:52.680 --> 16:53.820
<b>Doctor...</b>

16:54.490 --> 16:56.030
<b>How's Gon?</b>

16:57.100 --> 16:59.910
<b>He's still in critical condition.</b>

17:01.180 --> 17:04.950
<b>I wouldn't recommend sending 
him to a specialist</b>

17:04.950 --> 17:08.920
<b>until he can be taken off life support.</b>

17:10.070 --> 17:12.220
<b>I've never seen or heard of anything like this.</b>

17:12.650 --> 17:16.480
<b>How could this happen overnight 
to a twelve-year-old boy?</b>

17:17.990 --> 17:18.800
<b>I understand.</b>

17:19.700 --> 17:22.310
<b>We'll bring the specialist here.</b>

17:24.000 --> 17:26.940
<b>He's a hero who's earned special treatment.</b>

17:27.570 --> 17:29.550
<b>I will cover all the expenses.</b>

17:30.120 --> 17:33.940
<b>If necessary, we may have to 
rebuild this entire hospital.</b>

17:35.920 --> 17:36.950
<b>In any case,</b>

17:38.070 --> 17:40.230
<b>we cannot let Gon die.</b>

18:02.360 --> 18:03.630
<b><i>In the end,</i></b>

18:04.710 --> 18:07.330
<b><i>you did everything by yourself...</i></b>

18:09.800 --> 18:13.730
<b><i>I want that one myself!</i></b>

18:14.660 --> 18:15.820
<b><i>I get it.</i></b>

18:16.570 --> 18:20.640
<b><i>Kite saved your life, and he 
has no connection to me.</i></b>

18:23.910 --> 18:26.570
<b><i>But... Still...</i></b>

18:27.840 --> 18:31.220
<b><i>I wanted you to ask for my 
help in defeating Pitou!</i></b>

18:37.270 --> 18:37.930
<b><i>Let's go.</i></b>

18:39.970 --> 18:42.540
<b><i>Did you say that to me as a teammate?</i></b>

18:43.180 --> 18:46.480
<b><i>Or as a friend?</i></b>

18:51.020 --> 18:52.180
<b><i>I know...</i></b>

18:52.950 --> 18:54.490
<b><i>This is just a tantrum.</i></b>

18:56.190 --> 18:58.950
<b>It's the same as always.</b>

19:01.210 --> 19:03.950
<b>You run ahead,</b>

19:04.920 --> 19:06.950
<b>while I clean up after you.</b>

19:11.110 --> 19:12.670
<b>The same as always...</b>

19:17.890 --> 19:19.340
<b>I'll clean up your mess!</b>

19:20.550 --> 19:23.510
<b><i>But this time, I won't let it slide.</i></b>

19:26.180 --> 19:27.590
<b><i>You have to apologize.</i></b>

19:29.980 --> 19:32.250
<b><i>I'm going to</i></b>

19:33.210 --> 19:34.820
<b><i>heal you up!</i></b>

19:36.700 --> 19:39.520
<b>So you have to apologize!</b>

19:45.210 --> 19:46.230
<b>Killua...</b>

19:48.910 --> 19:52.120
<b>We're assembling a team of 
medical specialists to save Gon.</b>

19:53.000 --> 19:56.780
<b>I must head back, so I can use 
Hide and Seek to transport</b>

19:56.780 --> 19:58.600
<b>equipment and people.</b>

20:00.440 --> 20:01.650
<b>Will you come with me?</b>

20:06.330 --> 20:08.390
<b>No, I won't.</b>

20:10.000 --> 20:11.330
<b>That's true...</b>

20:11.750 --> 20:15.590
<b>It's important to stay with Gon 
and talk to him, as well.</b>

20:15.590 --> 20:17.020
<b>I'm going to save Gon.</b>

20:19.930 --> 20:21.610
<b>You go get those doctors.</b>

20:22.240 --> 20:23.650
<b>They'll still be needed...</b>

20:26.080 --> 20:28.040
<b>While I'm gone.</b>

<b>Killua?</b>

20:48.270 --> 20:52.340
<b><i>I'm the one who'll save Gon!</i></b>

20:58.500 --> 21:02.270
<b><i>Uh, I am Netero...</i></b>

21:02.720 --> 21:05.730
<b><i>I'm resigning as chairman, so you're on your own.</i></b>

21:06.920 --> 21:10.420
<b><i>The next chairman will be selected by election.</i></b>

21:10.420 --> 21:14.510
<b><i>I am setting the condition that 
all Hunters must vote.</i></b>

21:18.880 --> 21:24.030

<b>the Zodiacs, the Hunter Association's leaders, 
assembled at headquarters that day.</b>

23:24.610 --> 23:27.080
<b>Next time: Debate x Among x Zodiacs.</b>

23:27.080 --> 23:30.040
<b>I won't say anything until I've seen your face.</b>
