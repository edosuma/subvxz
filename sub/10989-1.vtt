00:29.363 --> 00:31.469
<i>This is Bruce Davids from London.</i>

00:31.549 --> 00:35.949
<i>Around me, the city is in flames from
the German bombs dropped last night</i>

00:36.029 --> 00:37.659
<i>by Hitler's Luftwaffe.</i>

00:37.747 --> 00:40.544
<i>The countless dead are
being dug from the rubble,</i>

00:40.624 --> 00:42.004
<i>and on the coast of France,</i>

00:42.084 --> 00:44.924
<i>the German armies
wait for this country to surrender.</i>

00:45.046 --> 00:47.336
<i>But English troops are fighting back,</i>

00:47.465 --> 00:50.295
<i>and in the skies,
the young men of the Royal Air Force</i>

00:50.384 --> 00:54.392
<i>are struggling against the Nazi
forces, which, only a year ago,</i>

00:54.472 --> 00:57.182
<i>invaded Poland, swept through France,</i>

00:57.266 --> 01:01.774
<i>and left this country standing alone
in a conflict, which, if lost,</i>

01:01.854 --> 01:03.984
<i>could destroy the free world.</i>

01:28.214 --> 01:29.760
Very good, Sergeant Major,
move the men in.

01:29.840 --> 01:31.090
Right.

01:31.175 --> 01:33.295
All right, you lads! Move!

01:41.560 --> 01:43.482
Sorry, lads, mind your backs. Gangway.

01:43.562 --> 01:45.192
Mind your backs.

01:59.245 --> 02:00.655
Move!

02:18.389 --> 02:20.853
I found the four extra carriages you need.

02:20.933 --> 02:21.979
Good.

02:22.059 --> 02:23.309
You'll have your thousand men,

02:23.394 --> 02:24.648
unfed, but they'll be there.

02:24.728 --> 02:26.398
I'd rather be with them
than in this madhouse.

02:26.480 --> 02:28.069
Finland appeals to you, does it?

02:28.149 --> 02:29.361
Is it the country or the ladies?

02:29.441 --> 02:31.401
Just a brief surge of patriotism.

02:31.986 --> 02:33.066
You coming for a drink?

02:33.154 --> 02:35.114
Thanks, no. Perhaps tomorrow.

02:42.329 --> 02:43.667
Hello?

02:43.747 --> 02:45.117
See you in the morning.

02:45.207 --> 02:46.377
Yes.

02:49.670 --> 02:51.710
Three that I can see from here.

02:54.008 --> 02:55.218
Cheers.

03:09.231 --> 03:10.271
Mr. Faber?

03:10.357 --> 03:11.477
Hello, Billy.

03:11.567 --> 03:14.237
I've got another
interview with the Army tomorrow.

03:14.403 --> 03:17.113
I don't think
you look any older than you did last week.

03:17.198 --> 03:19.537
Oh, but my mate Harry,
he's got some cream.

03:19.617 --> 03:21.705
He said it will take
the pimples off just like that.

03:21.785 --> 03:23.825
There's no need to rush, Billy.

03:23.913 --> 03:26.623
There'll be plenty of war left.
I can promise you.

03:26.707 --> 03:28.417
But I want to fight now.

03:30.211 --> 03:32.501
Everyone's in uniform except me.

03:32.963 --> 03:35.473
Well, unless they got
a special job like you.

03:37.468 --> 03:38.968
What about the Navy, Billy?

03:39.053 --> 03:41.473
Yeah, well, I've been
thinking about the Navy,

03:41.805 --> 03:43.561
but, well, I can't swim a stroke.

03:43.641 --> 03:45.396
Oh, then the Air Force is out.

03:45.476 --> 03:46.516
Why?

03:46.602 --> 03:48.652
Well, you haven't got wings, have you?

03:49.438 --> 03:51.648
- There you go, my love.
- Thank you.

03:55.527 --> 03:57.067
- All the best, love.
- Thank you.

03:57.154 --> 03:58.492
- Our very best.
- Good luck, darling.

03:58.572 --> 04:00.662
Thank you.

04:00.783 --> 04:02.371
Uh, Mrs. Rose?

04:02.451 --> 04:03.661
David, darling?

04:03.744 --> 04:05.874
I think I'd better go and get changed.

04:06.997 --> 04:08.127
Can I help?

04:08.207 --> 04:09.287
No, you can't.

04:11.168 --> 04:14.300
Well, my boy, when do
you join your squadron?

04:14.380 --> 04:15.670
- Tomorrow, sir.
- Oh.

04:15.756 --> 04:17.926
Spitfire. I saw her yesterday. Lovely kite.

04:18.341 --> 04:20.012
All right, then, there we are.

04:20.636 --> 04:21.846
Mama...

04:22.304 --> 04:25.064
Oh, Mama, I'm so happy.

04:25.516 --> 04:26.806
Oh, darling.

04:27.559 --> 04:28.849
He is a lovely boy.

04:28.978 --> 04:30.058
Isn't he?

04:32.856 --> 04:33.856
Darling.

04:35.734 --> 04:37.574
Off you go, Emma.

04:37.778 --> 04:39.238
Both of you.

04:41.573 --> 04:43.243
- Lucy?
- Yes?

04:44.410 --> 04:46.000
Lucy, I...

04:47.037 --> 04:49.917
I don't know what
you're expecting tonight but I...

04:50.833 --> 04:53.843
Well, I... I think you should know that...

04:54.336 --> 04:55.586
Mama, I do know.

04:59.383 --> 05:00.843
Goodbye, mother.

05:04.054 --> 05:07.311
<i>For he's a jolly good fellow</i>

05:07.391 --> 05:10.211
<i>Which nobody can deny</i>

05:14.565 --> 05:15.645
Bye!

05:15.733 --> 05:16.733
Bye!

05:16.984 --> 05:17.994
Bye!

05:28.162 --> 05:30.252
Oi, Billy, you missed your tea.

05:30.414 --> 05:32.962
And you, Faber.
Come and have some at the pub.

05:33.042 --> 05:34.838
Thanks, I'll just have a quick wash first.

05:34.918 --> 05:37.248
- See you later then.
- Here, Freddie, can I come?

05:37.338 --> 05:39.168
Oh, I don't know about that.

05:39.256 --> 05:40.336
You in the Army yet?

05:40.424 --> 05:42.554
Tell them about that miracle cream, Billy.

05:42.718 --> 05:45.928
Oh, yeah.
Will you tell Mrs. Garden I'll be late?

05:46.430 --> 05:48.140
My mate Harry's got this cream...

05:56.774 --> 06:00.489
Mr. Faber, I've kept
a nice piece of meat pie warm for you.

06:00.569 --> 06:02.609
Well, we mustn't let that
go to waste, must we?

06:03.113 --> 06:05.452
Not with this dreadful
rationing, we mustn't.

06:05.532 --> 06:07.122
I'll be down in a minute.

06:17.920 --> 06:20.630
24 hours isn't very long
for a honeymoon, is it?

06:21.173 --> 06:23.633
We can start right now.
There's a bottle of bubbly down there.

06:26.595 --> 06:28.175
So there is.

06:29.807 --> 06:31.937
There we are. Are there glasses?

06:32.017 --> 06:33.977
But of course. Everything supplied.

06:38.440 --> 06:39.690
Oh, dear.

06:40.109 --> 06:41.189
What?

06:41.652 --> 06:44.072
Well, I was just thinking of Mother.

06:44.154 --> 06:46.034
This afternoon she tried to tell me

06:46.115 --> 06:48.195
what happens on a wedding night.

06:48.617 --> 06:50.487
She's a bit late, isn't she?
What did you say?

06:50.577 --> 06:53.157
Well, I said she was a bit late, didn't I?

07:10.222 --> 07:11.392
Henry?

07:15.352 --> 07:16.692
Mr. Faber?

07:34.788 --> 07:35.868
What are you doing?

07:37.040 --> 07:38.630
It's all right.

07:38.750 --> 07:40.964
It's just for the station.

07:41.044 --> 07:43.384
It's classified work
regarding train movements.

07:43.464 --> 07:44.968
I shouldn't really even be telling you this.

07:45.048 --> 07:46.128
No, no.

07:46.216 --> 07:47.426
Listen to me for just...

07:47.509 --> 07:49.139
No! No! No!

07:49.219 --> 07:50.307
Trust me.

07:50.387 --> 07:51.387
You're a spy.

07:51.472 --> 07:52.722
Stop. Stop. God, please...

07:52.806 --> 07:54.311
- No, no, no, no!
- Listen to me. Please, don't.

07:59.938 --> 08:02.068
<i>It is such a lovely evening</i>

08:02.566 --> 08:05.486
<i>Won't you stroll beneath the trees?</i>

08:05.569 --> 08:07.991
<i>Oh, your little Pomeranian</i>

08:08.071 --> 08:10.321
<i>Has seen my little Pekinese</i>

08:10.991 --> 08:13.831
<i>Oh, it's just a casual meeting</i>

08:13.911 --> 08:16.458
<i>Dare I give your hand a squeeze?</i>

08:16.538 --> 08:19.211
<i>Oh, look! Your little Pomeranian</i>

08:19.291 --> 08:20.501
<i>Has kissed my little...</i>

08:22.377 --> 08:26.417
<i>Last night, the Luftwaffe's
main target was again London.</i>

08:26.507 --> 08:29.797
<i>Considerable damage was done
to residential and industrial areas</i>

08:29.885 --> 08:32.482
<i>and it is feared the loss of life will...</i>

08:45.317 --> 08:47.897
David, be careful.
You're not in your Spitfire yet.

08:57.311 --> 08:59.031
My God!

09:42.708 --> 09:44.668
Dearly beloved brethren,

09:45.168 --> 09:48.378
the Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away.

09:49.548 --> 09:51.470
He gives us the sheep,

09:51.550 --> 09:54.720
and we give him back the bones.

09:56.930 --> 09:59.850
Lucy, I think I've offended
your mother again.

10:00.100 --> 10:03.400
I'm right here, David.
You may address me directly.

10:04.438 --> 10:05.984
A tantalizing invitation.

10:06.064 --> 10:07.864
David, please.

10:08.942 --> 10:10.282
Drink up, darling.

10:14.281 --> 10:16.370
You'll be packed and ready, won't you?

10:16.450 --> 10:18.790
You needn't worry. I'm ready now.

10:19.244 --> 10:20.374
Good.

10:23.264 --> 10:24.814
Daddy!

10:38.847 --> 10:40.767
Mother, I apologize for David.

10:40.849 --> 10:43.229
He finds it difficult to be with people now.

10:43.352 --> 10:44.692
You understand.

10:45.187 --> 10:47.107
Oh, of course, darling.

10:47.773 --> 10:49.319
Oh, my poor girl.

10:49.399 --> 10:51.489
Oh, no, no, no. I'm all right.

10:51.610 --> 10:54.150
We are all all right, aren't we, Tom?

10:54.404 --> 10:56.284
Aye, indeed we are.

10:57.407 --> 10:59.577
Well, it's goodbye, mistress.

10:59.743 --> 11:02.293
These are for you and your husband.

11:02.454 --> 11:05.754
I know there isn't enough to eat
in London at the moment.

11:07.376 --> 11:08.916
Thank you, Tom.

11:10.379 --> 11:11.919
Thank you, Tom!

11:13.674 --> 11:15.134
Come on, Tom.

11:17.094 --> 11:18.264
He's drunk.

11:18.428 --> 11:19.428
Mmm!

11:19.513 --> 11:20.892
Is he always like that?

11:20.972 --> 11:22.019
Most of the time, yes,

11:22.099 --> 11:23.809
but he's a good friend to us.

11:23.892 --> 11:26.690
Anytime you want to
come home, you and Jo...

11:26.770 --> 11:30.320
No, no. My home is here,
Mother, with David and Jo.

11:31.608 --> 11:33.988
Anyway it was you
who told me not expect marriage

11:34.069 --> 11:36.609
to be uninterrupted pleasure, wasn't it?

11:37.406 --> 11:39.196
- I'm afraid it was.
- Yes, it was.

11:40.784 --> 11:42.994
Well, at least Jo seems well.

11:43.078 --> 11:44.708
I kissed him on the ear.

11:44.788 --> 11:46.288
Perhaps if you have another?

11:48.583 --> 11:51.753
Why ever not? Surely David's capable.

11:52.212 --> 11:53.422
Oh, yes.

11:53.672 --> 11:57.972
But he can't bear to pass me in
the hallway for fear of touching me.

12:06.685 --> 12:07.939
Come on, Lucy!

12:08.019 --> 12:09.689
I do love you.

12:10.188 --> 12:12.898
Now, it's not necessary to talk to father
about any of this, is it?

12:12.983 --> 12:15.573
- No.
- No. Come on then.

12:16.319 --> 12:18.949
- Bye-bye, Grandma.
- Come along, Jo.

15:27.218 --> 15:28.807
Someone's in with Muller.

15:28.887 --> 15:30.141
Good.

15:30.221 --> 15:32.221
We'll give them 60 seconds and then go in.

15:34.184 --> 15:37.023
You've left a trail
a blind man could follow.

15:37.103 --> 15:38.273
We're surrounded.

15:43.193 --> 15:44.573
Speak in English.

15:47.614 --> 15:50.284
The <i>Fuhrer</i> wants you
to reassess the strength

15:50.367 --> 15:52.907
of General Patton's army in East Anglia.

15:52.994 --> 15:54.204
It's invasion strength.

15:54.287 --> 15:55.787
They have the aerial photographs.

15:56.456 --> 15:59.536
General Patton is ready
to invade Europe at any time,

15:59.626 --> 16:01.286
at Pas de Calais.

16:03.046 --> 16:05.626
- Hitler's astrologer...
- An astrologer?

16:06.132 --> 16:07.342
My God.

16:07.801 --> 16:11.221
Well, he believes
the attack will be at Normandy.

16:12.722 --> 16:14.062
All right.

16:16.142 --> 16:20.732
I will reassess,
and I will signal in the usual way.

16:20.855 --> 16:21.895
No.

16:22.107 --> 16:24.567
Absolutely no further radio contact.

16:24.985 --> 16:26.275
You have to take photographs.

16:26.361 --> 16:28.411
You must deliver them
personally to the <i>Fuehrer.</i>

16:28.738 --> 16:30.158
Personally? Why personally?

16:30.240 --> 16:31.703
He says he trusts you.

16:31.783 --> 16:33.830
He wants to hear it from your own mouth.

16:33.910 --> 16:35.660
Well, I'm flattered.

16:35.787 --> 16:38.287
Admiral Canaris is sending a U-boat

16:38.373 --> 16:40.045
to pick you up off the coast of Scotland.

16:40.125 --> 16:41.125
That's nice of Willie.

16:41.209 --> 16:43.417
Have you been carrying this around
with you ever since you arrived in England?

16:43.503 --> 16:44.593
Yes. Why?

16:44.838 --> 16:45.838
Let's go.

16:45.922 --> 16:47.052
We'll get them both together.

16:47.757 --> 16:49.047
What's this?

16:49.926 --> 16:52.926
Storm Island, two miles
from the rendezvous.

16:53.847 --> 16:55.307
The U-boat will pick me up when?

16:55.390 --> 16:56.640
Only when you signal it,

16:56.725 --> 16:59.265
from 6:00 in the evening
until 6:00 in the morning.

17:00.186 --> 17:03.186
6:00 in the evening
till 6:00 in the morning?

17:03.440 --> 17:04.650
Beginning when?

17:04.733 --> 17:06.573
Uh, a week from today

17:06.984 --> 17:08.605
and for a week after that.

17:14.701 --> 17:15.951
And you?

17:16.327 --> 17:17.787
How will you get out of England?

17:19.329 --> 17:21.829
I'm supposed to get
to, uh, Liverpool somehow.

17:22.834 --> 17:25.304
If they capture you and torture you?

17:26.755 --> 17:29.295
- I have a suicide pill.
- Would you use it?

17:32.469 --> 17:33.848
Of course,

17:33.928 --> 17:35.058
if necessary.

18:12.300 --> 18:14.970
Jo wants me to say good night
to Daddy for him.

18:17.931 --> 18:19.561
He love you very much.

18:21.768 --> 18:23.018
I love him.

18:27.774 --> 18:30.074
I know, but you don't show it.

18:31.361 --> 18:33.071
You never tell him.

18:33.488 --> 18:35.068
You never hold him.

18:41.287 --> 18:43.707
You mustn't be afraid
now that he's growing up.

18:43.790 --> 18:45.330
Afraid of what?

18:46.543 --> 18:48.673
What the hell have I got to be afraid off?

18:48.753 --> 18:50.963
I'm gonna go for walks with him, aren't I?

18:51.047 --> 18:53.636
And swim with him?
And play football with him?

18:53.716 --> 18:56.386
- David...
- I want him to be proud of me, don't I?

18:56.678 --> 18:58.508
To grow up like his father,

18:58.930 --> 19:01.220
a legless fucking joke?

19:16.322 --> 19:20.992
I suppose you and your mother
had a lovely time discussing me.

19:23.246 --> 19:25.076
She's very concerned about you.

19:25.582 --> 19:27.922
I don't need anyone's concern.

19:28.960 --> 19:30.670
I'll manage alone.

19:34.465 --> 19:35.755
I can't.

19:42.265 --> 19:44.345
David, I need you.

19:48.688 --> 19:50.768
- I love you.
- Don't.

19:51.107 --> 19:52.397
Please don't.

19:52.984 --> 19:55.784
I want to sleep.
For God's sake, let me sleep!

20:17.800 --> 20:19.220
Thank you.

20:19.802 --> 20:22.472
And you haven't let this room to anybody

20:22.555 --> 20:24.227
since the death of Mrs. Gunn?

20:24.307 --> 20:27.387
Oh, no, sir, not since
Billy Parkin lived here.

20:27.518 --> 20:28.808
He's in the Army now...

20:28.895 --> 20:31.725
I think I've seen everything
I wanted to see.

20:33.816 --> 20:35.566
Thank you very much.

21:11.771 --> 21:12.811
Sergeant!

21:13.356 --> 21:14.356
Billy Parkin?

21:14.524 --> 21:15.612
That's right, sir.

21:15.692 --> 21:17.072
Hello, sir.

21:17.360 --> 21:19.030
What's this all about?

21:20.280 --> 21:21.280
Murder.

21:22.115 --> 21:24.695
I'll never forget coming back
from the pub.

21:25.326 --> 21:26.786
There she was,

21:27.996 --> 21:28.996
dead.

21:30.039 --> 21:31.709
Do you know that was
the worst shock of my life?

21:31.791 --> 21:33.251
I'm sure.

21:34.502 --> 21:36.302
Bloody Henry Faber.

21:37.672 --> 21:39.052
My hero, he was.

21:39.757 --> 21:40.757
Bastard.

21:41.884 --> 21:45.894
Even wounded in the war.
Medals on his chest.

21:48.516 --> 21:49.886
Anyway, what do you want me for?

21:52.395 --> 21:53.645
What we have here, Sergeant,

21:53.730 --> 21:57.400
are photographs of different German
military graduation classes.

21:57.567 --> 21:59.687
Same year, different schools.

22:02.405 --> 22:03.945
Take your time.

22:07.744 --> 22:09.165
I am looking for Faber, am I?

22:09.245 --> 22:10.245
Yes. Yes.

23:18.189 --> 23:19.819
That's him!

23:20.316 --> 23:21.436
Where?

23:21.943 --> 23:23.573
Well, that's him.

23:24.695 --> 23:26.695
That's Faber to the life.

23:29.492 --> 23:32.915
And, look, Admiral Wilhelm Canaris,

23:32.995 --> 23:35.245
the head of German Intelligence,

23:35.915 --> 23:37.955
and right behind him, his young student,

23:38.167 --> 23:39.167
"The Needle."

23:46.467 --> 23:47.927
Going fishing?

23:48.553 --> 23:52.273
- And a little bird-watching as well.
- If you're lucky.

23:54.100 --> 23:56.314
Just keep to the far side of the canal.

23:56.394 --> 23:58.354
Restricted area, this side.

23:59.188 --> 24:00.610
Really?

24:00.690 --> 24:02.360
Starts half a mile from here.

24:22.670 --> 24:24.630
The man code-named "The Needle,"

24:24.881 --> 24:26.801
also known as Henry Faber.

24:27.341 --> 24:30.181
He was born on May 26, 1900,

24:30.344 --> 24:33.184
at a village called Ulm in West Prussia.

24:35.016 --> 24:36.354
At the age of 13,

24:36.434 --> 24:39.404
he went to the Karlsruhe
Cadet School in Bonn.

24:40.521 --> 24:42.481
Two years later, he was transferred

24:42.565 --> 24:46.565
to the more prestigious
<i>Grosse Lichterfelde</i> near Berlin.

24:47.570 --> 24:49.490
<i>He already spoke fluent English</i>

24:49.906 --> 24:52.703
<i>because his father,
Baron Von Muller Gulder,</i>

24:52.783 --> 24:55.832
<i>had been posted to Washington
as German military attache</i>

24:55.912 --> 24:58.872
<i>and had sent his son
to private school there.</i>

24:59.665 --> 25:03.047
<i>But, back in Germany, the boy rebelled
constantly against authority</i>

25:03.127 --> 25:04.997
<i>and was often flogged for it.</i>

25:06.839 --> 25:09.719
<i>He passed his final exam
with extremely high marks.</i>

25:10.009 --> 25:13.719
<i>In the '20s, The Needle was a cadet
at the war school in Metz,</i>

25:13.846 --> 25:16.266
<i>and Wilhelm Canaris befriended him.</i>

25:17.266 --> 25:20.596
<i>In '31, Hitler visited
the family estate and met him.</i>

25:21.020 --> 25:22.859
<i>In '33, Hitler came to power,</i>

25:22.939 --> 25:24.479
<i>and The Needle was made a captain</i>

25:24.565 --> 25:27.935
<i>and sent to Berlin for unspecified duties.</i>

25:29.070 --> 25:31.576
<i>He had a passionate affair
with a German actress.</i>

25:31.656 --> 25:34.326
<i>He never married. He made no close friends.</i>

25:34.867 --> 25:36.327
<i>And in '38,</i>

25:36.744 --> 25:38.624
<i>The Needle disappeared.</i>

25:44.669 --> 25:45.749
God.

28:35.840 --> 28:37.300
Clever bastards.

28:58.112 --> 29:00.202
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

29:00.406 --> 29:01.986
And who might you be?

29:02.616 --> 29:04.486
I should be asking who you are.

29:04.702 --> 29:06.332
You're on my boat.

29:07.204 --> 29:08.584
What's in that bag?

29:08.664 --> 29:11.420
Binoculars, camera, reference books.

29:11.500 --> 29:12.670
Oh, no, you don't!

29:13.335 --> 29:14.335
Put your hands up.

29:16.422 --> 29:18.012
Would you mind?

29:18.549 --> 29:19.759
Thanks you.

29:53.542 --> 29:55.382
How nice to hear from you.

29:56.837 --> 29:58.087
Of course!

29:59.423 --> 30:01.683
Yes. That shouldn't be too difficult, sir.

30:02.343 --> 30:04.763
You would prefer it in the morning?

30:04.845 --> 30:07.135
By all means. Yes, yes, I...

30:07.765 --> 30:09.135
Good night.

30:26.742 --> 30:28.992
I want that
in the diplomatic pouch to Lisbon

30:29.078 --> 30:30.078
this afternoon.

30:30.162 --> 30:31.667
And from there to Berlin?

30:31.747 --> 30:33.497
- As soon as possible.
- Fine.

30:35.793 --> 30:37.593
May I ask you...

30:40.256 --> 30:42.086
It's insurance.

30:46.679 --> 30:49.349
You don't come to us very often.

30:50.099 --> 30:51.519
Not very.

30:51.767 --> 30:53.937
You keep to yourself, mmm?

30:55.104 --> 30:56.614
A cautious man.

30:57.773 --> 30:59.153
A cautious life.

30:59.233 --> 31:02.031
But then, how else
could one survive these days?

31:02.111 --> 31:03.531
One could stop.

31:04.697 --> 31:06.157
Oh, but not you.

31:07.199 --> 31:08.489
Training.

31:09.076 --> 31:10.076
Patriotism.

31:10.452 --> 31:12.252
- Good.
- Here, please.

32:13.807 --> 32:14.847
Pull in here, cabby.

32:22.191 --> 32:23.361
Thank you.

32:55.516 --> 32:57.226
Do you know what these are, Godliman?

32:58.477 --> 33:00.147
American aircraft.

33:01.563 --> 33:06.153
These are photographs of Patton's
Allied invasion force in East Anglia.

33:07.987 --> 33:09.700
As far as the Germans are concerned,

33:09.780 --> 33:11.493
there are only two possible places

33:11.573 --> 33:13.913
for an Allied invasion of Europe.

33:17.413 --> 33:18.833
And they're right.

33:20.165 --> 33:23.785
From East Anglia here to the Pas de Calais,

33:24.420 --> 33:26.008
or from the south coast of England

33:26.088 --> 33:28.048
to the beaches of Normandy.

33:29.008 --> 33:31.838
Operation Overlord has
decided on Normandy.

33:32.761 --> 33:36.021
Then what is General Patton's army
doing in East Anglia?

33:36.640 --> 33:38.062
There is no army.

33:38.142 --> 33:39.897
These planes are made out of plywood.

33:39.977 --> 33:41.807
We did it to fool the Germans,

33:41.895 --> 33:44.355
and the man who took
those photographs must know it.

33:45.107 --> 33:46.777
Consequently, he must also know

33:46.859 --> 33:49.319
that we intend to invade Normandy.

33:50.529 --> 33:52.109
Find him, Godliman.

33:52.197 --> 33:54.117
It could cost us the bloody war.

33:59.288 --> 34:01.708
Well, sir, if you, uh, were at this station

34:01.790 --> 34:03.460
and wanted to get out of the country,

34:03.584 --> 34:07.549
you could go to Holyhead
or Liverpool or Glasgow

34:07.629 --> 34:09.339
and then catch a ferry to Ireland.

34:09.422 --> 34:11.094
No, he wouldn't risk Holyhead

34:11.175 --> 34:12.965
because of the passport control.

34:13.052 --> 34:15.012
How about Liverpool to Belfast?

34:15.471 --> 34:17.351
Car across Ireland,
and a U-boat on the coast.

34:17.598 --> 34:18.560
Liverpool?

34:18.639 --> 34:21.520
In that case,
you're talking about our 11:45,

34:21.601 --> 34:23.065
Marylebone to Inverness,

34:23.145 --> 34:26.014
stopping at Stafford,
Crewe, Liverpool, Glasgow...

34:26.106 --> 34:29.186
Liverpool. That's where he'll get off.
You're right.

34:29.275 --> 34:30.781
Well, the 11:45 left on time.

34:30.860 --> 34:32.610
Now how do we get on it?

34:33.072 --> 34:34.909
Well, you could stop
the train this side of...

34:34.989 --> 34:36.659
Stop the train. Get us a plane.

34:36.742 --> 34:38.492
- Yes. Right, sir.
- You're coming with us, Billy.

34:47.168 --> 34:48.998
- Fancy a game of poker, mate?
- Why not?

34:54.426 --> 34:56.045
We're stopping again.

34:56.678 --> 34:58.598
The engine driver probably ran out of coal.

34:58.680 --> 35:01.500
Probably forgot his ration book.

35:04.394 --> 35:05.774
Now, remember, Billy,

35:05.854 --> 35:07.904
you're just to point him out to me.

35:09.483 --> 35:10.733
Don't you worry, sir.

35:10.818 --> 35:13.278
I could recognize Faber in a stocking mask.

36:29.938 --> 36:33.528
Blackout. Put your blinds down. Thank you.

36:33.775 --> 36:35.065
Blackout.

36:36.612 --> 36:37.952
Pull your blinds down.

36:38.864 --> 36:40.124
Blackout.

37:03.847 --> 37:05.467
- Oi!
- Hey!

37:05.682 --> 37:07.892
Come on, give us a bit of room, pal.

37:17.152 --> 37:19.199
You shouldn't be on.

37:19.279 --> 37:22.159
Someone take him away. Come on. Blimey!

37:34.336 --> 37:35.836
Excuse me.

37:39.675 --> 37:41.795
Excuse me.

37:43.011 --> 37:44.221
Excuse me...

37:44.304 --> 37:46.184
Be still, or I'll kill you.

37:46.265 --> 37:47.595
Why are you looking for me?

37:47.683 --> 37:48.933
I'm not.

37:49.393 --> 37:50.733
Don't lie.

37:51.895 --> 37:54.685
Has the Army changed its uniforms, Billy?

37:55.774 --> 37:57.279
What's the plan?

37:57.359 --> 37:58.989
Where's the trap?

38:00.529 --> 38:03.449
Glasgow. They're waiting for you
at Glasgow.

38:07.369 --> 38:10.119
So they finally let you in the Army,
did they, Billy?

38:10.330 --> 38:11.580
Congratulations.

38:11.815 --> 38:12.895
Yeah.

38:33.562 --> 38:35.112
Oh, my God!

40:32.347 --> 40:34.478
Thank you. You've been terribly kind.

40:34.558 --> 40:36.388
Yeah. You won't change
your mind and come home

40:36.476 --> 40:37.846
and have a spot of lunch with me?

40:37.936 --> 40:39.396
No, I must get on to Banff.

40:39.479 --> 40:41.059
Oh, well. As you like.

40:41.148 --> 40:44.108
I hope your car's still there
when you get back to it.

40:44.192 --> 40:46.362
It won't get far without petrol.

40:58.290 --> 41:00.837
<i>The Red Army has been
scoring huge successes</i>

41:00.917 --> 41:02.957
<i>against the Germans throughout the winter,</i>

41:03.044 --> 41:06.554
<i>striking back with tanks and troops
all along the Eastern Front.</i>

41:10.051 --> 41:13.600
<i>Hitler's armies have suffered
a series of humiliating defeats</i>

41:13.680 --> 41:16.186
<i>and have fled, frozen and in disarray,</i>

41:16.266 --> 41:18.556
<i>through the killing snows of Russia.</i>

41:18.643 --> 41:20.899
<i>All this at the very moment
Hitler was saying</i>

41:20.979 --> 41:25.519
<i>that the word "surrender"
is not to be found in the German vocabulary.</i>

41:28.361 --> 41:30.409
<i>And now the American
and British Air Forces</i>

41:30.489 --> 41:32.869
<i>have stepped up
their daylight bombing of Germany.</i>

41:33.241 --> 41:36.501
<i>Mr. Churchill and General Eisenhower
are once again in conference,</i>

41:36.786 --> 41:38.208
<i>and with the approach of summer,</i>

41:38.288 --> 41:41.044
<i>a massive attack by the Allies
on the continent of Europe</i>

41:41.124 --> 41:43.634
<i>is, of course, only a matter of time.</i>

41:45.420 --> 41:48.510
<i>The fatal question
for the Nazi command must be</i>

41:48.590 --> 41:51.300
<i>"Where and when will
the invasion take place?"</i>

41:53.094 --> 41:55.142
<i>Admiral Canaris is sending a U-boat</i>

41:55.222 --> 41:57.018
<i>to pick you up off the coast of Scotland,</i>

41:57.098 --> 41:58.978
<i>but only when you signal it,</i>

41:59.059 --> 42:01.809
<i>from 6:00 in the evening
until 6:00 in the morning.</i>

42:01.895 --> 42:04.975
<i>You must deliver the photographs
personally to the</i> Fuehrer.

42:05.232 --> 42:06.982
<i>He says he trusts you.</i>

42:07.400 --> 42:09.490
<i>How very flattering.</i>

43:35.572 --> 43:37.242
Aye, that's the fellow.

43:37.324 --> 43:40.044
I picked him up in the middle of nowhere.

43:40.785 --> 43:43.955
Can't tell you what a fool I felt
when I saw this.

43:44.122 --> 43:45.972
So you're positive it was the same man?

43:46.099 --> 43:47.879
I offered him lunch.

43:48.126 --> 43:49.876
And he was going to Banff?

43:49.961 --> 43:52.091
I dropped him right opposite.

43:53.006 --> 43:54.416
Scotland Yard on the line, sir.

43:54.507 --> 43:55.717
At last.

43:57.218 --> 43:58.718
Scotland Yard?

43:59.429 --> 44:01.889
I know it's late. It's late here, too.

49:14.410 --> 49:15.580
David!

49:18.539 --> 49:19.829
Put your arm around me.

49:22.293 --> 49:23.633
That's it.

49:41.354 --> 49:44.404
Well, these are ten more sightings
of your man.

49:45.233 --> 49:46.483
All checked?

49:46.567 --> 49:48.487
We've interviewed eight of them.

49:48.611 --> 49:49.991
We're on to the other two.

49:50.071 --> 49:52.660
We've knocked on almost every door
from Cape Wrath to Carlisle.

49:52.740 --> 49:55.200
If he is on the coast,
he hasn't got a roof over his head.

50:03.084 --> 50:04.714
You're on Storm Island.

50:06.921 --> 50:08.171
Storm Island?

50:08.256 --> 50:10.086
Now you know how it got its name.

50:10.508 --> 50:13.298
You were swept into the bay here.
Everything always is.

50:15.263 --> 50:17.023
Please, don't get up.

50:17.640 --> 50:19.930
I've frightened your little girl.

50:20.018 --> 50:21.598
He's a boy.

50:22.103 --> 50:23.191
I'm sorry.

50:23.271 --> 50:25.191
No, I must cut his hair.

50:26.274 --> 50:28.404
Was anyone else on board with you?

50:30.028 --> 50:32.533
David, we really must put
the poor man to bed.

50:32.613 --> 50:34.283
No, I was alone.

50:34.490 --> 50:37.290
Didn't you bother to get
a weather report before you left?

50:38.077 --> 50:40.117
No.

50:40.246 --> 50:41.996
Did you notify the Coastguard of your route?

50:42.081 --> 50:43.711
David, darling, what does it matter?

50:43.791 --> 50:46.041
It matters, because if he did,

50:46.127 --> 50:48.457
there may be men out there
risking their lives looking for him.

50:48.796 --> 50:50.885
We can let them know
that he's sitting here safe and sound.

50:50.965 --> 50:52.465
No. No, um...

50:53.926 --> 50:58.636
No. I did not notify the Coastguard.

51:02.894 --> 51:04.984
I'll just turn the bed down.

51:08.816 --> 51:09.936
Oops.

51:10.109 --> 51:11.319
Okay.

51:20.203 --> 51:22.753
I've never seen anybody so exhausted.

51:23.706 --> 51:24.752
But Mummy...

51:24.832 --> 51:26.295
No, darling, you must play terribly quietly

51:26.375 --> 51:28.205
so that the man upstairs
can have a nice long sleep.

51:28.294 --> 51:30.091
He won't hear anything, the state he's in.

51:30.171 --> 51:32.171
- Mummy, why?
- David,

51:33.883 --> 51:35.343
who do you suppose he is?

51:35.760 --> 51:38.010
A damn fool, to be out in this weather.

51:40.848 --> 51:42.678
Well, he's not a working sailor.

51:43.476 --> 51:44.886
He's not a working sailor?

51:44.977 --> 51:46.983
No. Didn't you notice his hands?

51:47.063 --> 51:48.276
They're terribly soft.

51:48.356 --> 51:49.686
His hands?

51:50.024 --> 51:52.534
He's wearing a suit, for God's sake.

51:54.153 --> 51:56.783
You're bloody observant
all of a sudden, aren't you?

51:59.742 --> 52:01.702
I'm going over to Tom's.

52:01.953 --> 52:04.213
David! Suppose he wakes up?

52:13.923 --> 52:17.593
Um, who is that man in my room, Mummy?

52:19.595 --> 52:21.215
I don't know, darling.

52:37.321 --> 52:38.571
...with diamonds in it!

52:39.157 --> 52:40.697
You know what diamonds are, don't you?

52:40.867 --> 52:43.237
Sort of treasures, aren't they?

52:43.703 --> 52:45.963
We must cut your hair soon.

52:46.622 --> 52:49.629
If you didn't,
would it grow and grow and grow?

52:49.709 --> 52:53.298
Yes, it would grow down to your ears.

52:53.588 --> 52:55.918
Then it would grow down to your chin.

52:56.340 --> 52:58.010
Then it would grow down past here.

52:58.092 --> 52:59.388
Then it would curl up here.

52:59.468 --> 53:02.016
Then it would go down here.
Then it would start tickling your feet!

53:02.096 --> 53:04.466
Then we'd all have to get out of the bath!

53:05.266 --> 53:06.516
Why?

53:07.018 --> 53:10.768
Because if people
don't get out of their baths

53:11.230 --> 53:12.270
they

53:12.648 --> 53:13.648
melt!

53:13.858 --> 53:15.938
But I haven't.

53:30.666 --> 53:31.706
Mummy?

53:32.293 --> 53:34.303
Mummy, can I have my room back?

53:37.131 --> 53:38.131
Of course you can.

53:38.716 --> 53:40.126
Come on, darling.

53:41.385 --> 53:42.845
Get out of the bath!

54:03.324 --> 54:05.663
Do try not to ask questions, David.

54:05.743 --> 54:07.873
I want to cross-question him.

54:07.954 --> 54:10.254
It seems perfectly normal
to wonder who he is.

54:11.290 --> 54:14.210
I just think it would
be nice if you didn't go on at him.

54:14.293 --> 54:16.843
I'm only trying to find out what happened.

54:19.840 --> 54:21.050
Come in.

54:25.179 --> 54:26.429
Good evening.

54:26.931 --> 54:28.060
Hello.

54:28.140 --> 54:29.310
How are you feeling?

54:29.642 --> 54:31.312
Better, thank you.

54:34.105 --> 54:35.855
I'm Henry Baker.

54:36.607 --> 54:38.857
Hello. I'm Lucy. Lucy Rose.

54:38.943 --> 54:40.073
How do you do?

54:40.194 --> 54:41.824
This is my husband, David.

54:43.197 --> 54:44.737
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

54:45.032 --> 54:46.495
Have some hot soup.

54:46.575 --> 54:47.865
Thank you.

54:48.077 --> 54:49.787
- Bread?
- Yes, thank you.

54:53.833 --> 54:56.253
Can you tell me the time, please?

54:57.086 --> 54:58.666
It's 10 to 9:00

54:59.588 --> 55:00.878
10 to 9:00?

55:01.882 --> 55:03.382
Help yourself to cider.

55:03.968 --> 55:04.968
No, thank you.

55:10.641 --> 55:11.981
Thank you.

55:36.500 --> 55:39.090
I am very hungry.

55:45.593 --> 55:47.393
This is Storm Island?

55:47.762 --> 55:49.016
That's right.

55:49.096 --> 55:51.016
And what do you do here?

55:51.265 --> 55:52.305
Sheep farmer.

55:52.391 --> 55:53.601
Really?

55:53.976 --> 55:56.096
Look, I'm going to bed.
My back's playing up.

55:58.105 --> 55:59.355
You're a damn fool, you know.

55:59.607 --> 56:00.857
Lucky to be alive.

56:00.941 --> 56:03.030
Why were you out in the storm
in the first place?

56:03.110 --> 56:05.950
Because I had no idea
it was going to be so severe.

56:06.697 --> 56:08.737
Give me two. I want to sleep.

56:13.162 --> 56:14.662
I can do that.

56:24.423 --> 56:25.593
Good night.

56:32.306 --> 56:33.728
Would you like some more soup?

56:33.808 --> 56:35.058
No, thank you.

56:35.142 --> 56:36.772
It was delicious.

56:38.479 --> 56:41.069
There's some brandy next door.
Would you like some?

56:43.526 --> 56:44.936
Do sit down.

56:52.410 --> 56:54.540
Where do you live, Mr. Baker?

56:55.663 --> 56:57.753
I used to live on that boat.

56:59.708 --> 57:01.498
Suppose I am a damn fool.

57:02.753 --> 57:05.343
I moved from London about a month ago.

57:05.464 --> 57:06.674
Really?

57:07.758 --> 57:09.138
I haven't been to London for years.

57:09.218 --> 57:10.548
When were you last there?

57:10.636 --> 57:12.136
Four years ago.

57:13.222 --> 57:14.682
And that was to have a baby.

57:14.765 --> 57:16.515
- You've been here for four years?
- Yes.

57:16.600 --> 57:18.890
My goodness. I hope you have friends here.

57:18.978 --> 57:22.518
Well, there's Tom,
who takes care of the lighthouse,

57:22.690 --> 57:25.360
and the ferry comes
every other Monday with our supplies.

57:26.360 --> 57:27.990
- That's all?
- Yes.

57:28.195 --> 57:29.525
Cheers.

57:29.613 --> 57:30.703
Cheers.

57:32.199 --> 57:34.989
What do you do if there is an emergency?

57:36.036 --> 57:38.656
Well, there's a radio transmitter
at Tom's cottage,

57:39.373 --> 57:42.133
but that's really
more to do with the lighthouse.

57:46.422 --> 57:49.552
It seems a terribly lonely place to live.

57:51.218 --> 57:53.758
Well, you see,
David and I had a motor accident

57:53.846 --> 57:55.216
on the day we were married.

57:56.015 --> 57:58.095
That's how he lost his legs.

57:58.809 --> 58:01.399
He was training to be a fighter pilot,

58:02.062 --> 58:04.482
and then after the accident, he...

58:05.774 --> 58:07.614
Well, we both wanted to run away,

58:08.944 --> 58:10.744
and so we came here.

58:11.989 --> 58:13.949
Seemed like a good idea.

58:15.367 --> 58:16.827
Might have been a mistake.

58:16.911 --> 58:19.500
Well, you can't blame him
for wanting to run away.

58:19.580 --> 58:21.000
No, I don't.

58:22.625 --> 58:24.165
It's terribly sad.

58:24.835 --> 58:27.335
No, it was our fault completely.

58:27.922 --> 58:29.468
We'd had a bit to drink,

58:29.548 --> 58:33.302
and we were driving much too fast,
and then suddenly there was this lorry...

58:33.385 --> 58:35.675
No, I meant it was terribly sad

58:36.847 --> 58:38.307
because you're so unhappy now.

58:45.105 --> 58:46.765
Is it that obvious?

58:54.490 --> 58:56.030
I do love him, you know.

58:56.867 --> 58:58.737
The way he used to be.

59:01.705 --> 59:04.086
Times when he's suddenly like the old David

59:04.166 --> 59:07.336
and he and Jo and I
go and have a picnic on the cliff

59:07.419 --> 59:08.589
or something like that...

59:11.632 --> 59:13.762
He spends most of his time now with Tom.

59:13.842 --> 59:15.802
I think they just sit and drink.

59:18.806 --> 59:21.226
The first year that we were here,

59:22.184 --> 59:24.194
my parents came to visit.

59:25.729 --> 59:27.609
Oh, I can't tell you...

59:28.899 --> 59:30.029
He was silent,

59:30.109 --> 59:32.489
and he hid from them, and...

59:36.907 --> 59:38.867
I feel sad for Jo, really.

59:41.495 --> 59:44.035
He keeps asking about
his Granny and where she is.

59:44.164 --> 59:45.294
He's a nice little boy.

59:45.374 --> 59:46.834
Oh, isn't he?

59:47.668 --> 59:49.588
And he's so clever.

59:51.505 --> 59:53.295
And he's very brave.

59:53.507 --> 59:54.595
And lucky.

59:54.675 --> 59:55.835
Why do you think?

59:56.135 --> 59:57.415
To be so loved.

59:58.620 --> 01:00:00.965
No. No. I'm his mother.

01:00:01.599 --> 01:00:03.679
All parents love their children.

01:00:03.767 --> 01:00:04.887
No, no.

01:00:05.769 --> 01:00:07.229
No, not all.

01:00:07.771 --> 01:00:08.771
No.

01:00:09.815 --> 01:00:11.605
Some parents...

01:00:11.692 --> 01:00:13.442
Some parents use their children,

01:00:13.527 --> 01:00:14.823
set goals for them.

01:00:14.903 --> 01:00:17.113
Goals they weren't able
to attain in their lives.

01:00:19.366 --> 01:00:20.776
Hardly love, do you think?

01:00:22.286 --> 01:00:23.696
No, hardly.

01:00:31.170 --> 01:00:33.130
I wonder why you go on

01:00:33.380 --> 01:00:34.550
if it's not working.

01:00:38.886 --> 01:00:41.136
I suppose, if I were perfectly frank,

01:00:42.514 --> 01:00:44.270
I'd admit that I couldn't bear the idea

01:00:44.350 --> 01:00:46.600
that all the years of trying were wasted.

01:00:50.147 --> 01:00:51.477
I really don't think

01:00:52.232 --> 01:00:53.402
I could bear that.

01:00:56.236 --> 01:00:58.659
Oh, dear, four years on this island,

01:00:58.739 --> 01:01:00.409
and I've become such a bore.

01:01:03.118 --> 01:01:05.374
Tell me, Mr. Baker, are you married?

01:01:05.454 --> 01:01:06.500
No.

01:01:06.580 --> 01:01:08.830
What, through choice or bad luck?

01:01:08.916 --> 01:01:10.826
Do you think it's good luck to be married?

01:01:11.794 --> 01:01:13.344
Well, yes, normally.

01:01:16.423 --> 01:01:19.263
Sometimes I imagine myself married...

01:01:19.677 --> 01:01:20.927
To another man?

01:01:26.058 --> 01:01:27.348
You've hurt yourself.

01:01:27.643 --> 01:01:29.103
I'm awfully sorry.

01:01:47.121 --> 01:01:48.621
You're very beautiful.

01:02:06.432 --> 01:02:07.892
Please don't.

01:03:09.369 --> 01:03:12.960
We tied up Friday afternoon nice and early

01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:14.837
to keep out of that bloody storm.

01:03:14.917 --> 01:03:16.296
It's Sunday.

01:03:16.376 --> 01:03:18.206
Why did you not let us know she was gone?

01:03:18.295 --> 01:03:19.875
I haven't been down here since!

01:03:19.963 --> 01:03:21.343
McKilliam.

01:03:21.757 --> 01:03:24.797
Could that boat have survived the storm?

01:03:25.344 --> 01:03:26.804
Not a chance.

01:03:26.887 --> 01:03:28.387
Why do you think I left her here?

01:03:28.472 --> 01:03:29.472
If he were on it,

01:03:29.556 --> 01:03:30.926
where could he be now?

01:03:31.016 --> 01:03:32.855
At the bottom of the sea, the bloody fool.

01:03:32.935 --> 01:03:34.857
Aye! Good riddance to bad rubbish.

01:03:34.937 --> 01:03:36.557
He'd be drowned.

01:03:36.647 --> 01:03:39.067
I'll believe that when I see the body.

01:03:43.111 --> 01:03:44.151
Good morning.

01:03:45.989 --> 01:03:47.119
I've saved you some coffee.

01:03:47.199 --> 01:03:48.239
Do you take black or white?

01:03:48.325 --> 01:03:49.325
No, thank you.

01:03:49.576 --> 01:03:50.736
I'll make you some breakfast.

01:03:50.828 --> 01:03:52.038
No. I'll wait for lunch.

01:03:53.038 --> 01:03:55.078
It's lamb stew for lunch, I'm afraid.

01:03:56.083 --> 01:03:57.293
David says it won't be long

01:03:57.376 --> 01:03:58.496
before we all turn into sheep.

01:03:58.585 --> 01:03:59.585
Where is he?

01:03:59.670 --> 01:04:01.920
David? He's just gone out with Jo

01:04:02.005 --> 01:04:03.755
to check on the flock.

01:04:12.266 --> 01:04:13.766
Good morning, Lucy.

01:04:15.519 --> 01:04:16.599
Good morning.

01:04:16.770 --> 01:04:18.270
You don't despise me, do you?

01:04:19.606 --> 01:04:20.606
No.

01:04:20.774 --> 01:04:21.820
How could I?

01:04:21.900 --> 01:04:23.400
Oh, you could.

01:04:23.527 --> 01:04:24.777
I could.

01:04:26.613 --> 01:04:27.953
It can't happen again.

01:04:28.115 --> 01:04:29.405
It won't.

01:04:31.869 --> 01:04:33.449
Do you regret it?

01:04:37.165 --> 01:04:38.245
Oh...

01:04:44.339 --> 01:04:45.549
Let's go out.

01:04:58.228 --> 01:04:59.938
You'll be gone soon,

01:05:01.064 --> 01:05:02.864
now the storm's over.

01:05:06.719 --> 01:05:09.069
Not in that, I won't.

01:05:23.253 --> 01:05:24.763
I don't even know what you do.

01:05:26.548 --> 01:05:28.008
I'm a writer.

01:05:29.092 --> 01:05:31.052
A writer? Are you really?

01:05:32.596 --> 01:05:33.926
Good Lord.

01:05:35.140 --> 01:05:36.600
What do you write about?

01:05:37.184 --> 01:05:38.444
The war.

01:05:39.186 --> 01:05:42.266
No, not battles and killing,

01:05:42.814 --> 01:05:44.324
but isolation.

01:05:44.858 --> 01:05:47.108
The feeling some men have

01:05:47.194 --> 01:05:51.244
of being suddenly separated
from every other man.

01:05:51.740 --> 01:05:53.620
But I thought war was meant

01:05:53.700 --> 01:05:55.120
to bring people closer together.

01:05:55.202 --> 01:05:56.202
Well...

01:05:57.120 --> 01:05:58.120
Not me.

01:06:01.541 --> 01:06:02.751
And you?

01:06:12.427 --> 01:06:14.387
Is there a woman in your book?

01:06:14.471 --> 01:06:16.221
I shall put you in it.

01:06:19.559 --> 01:06:22.149
- No, really, is there?
- Yes.

01:06:23.230 --> 01:06:24.730
One woman.

01:06:26.108 --> 01:06:27.858
What does she do?

01:06:28.402 --> 01:06:30.152
She lives.

01:06:30.612 --> 01:06:33.242
Has an affair with our hero.

01:06:34.491 --> 01:06:36.830
- Then she dies.
- What, in the blitz?

01:06:36.910 --> 01:06:37.910
No.

01:06:38.412 --> 01:06:39.412
He kills her.

01:06:41.665 --> 01:06:43.285
She broke his heart.

01:06:55.137 --> 01:06:56.257
I'd better get back there.

01:06:56.388 --> 01:06:57.388
He'll be coming.

01:07:10.277 --> 01:07:13.067
I hope Lucy didn't keep you up
too late last night.

01:07:13.530 --> 01:07:14.570
No.

01:07:17.367 --> 01:07:18.697
I'm going over to Tom's,

01:07:18.785 --> 01:07:21.285
see if he's repaired the transmitter aerial.

01:07:21.538 --> 01:07:22.708
Would you like to come along?

01:07:22.789 --> 01:07:24.209
If I can help, yes.

01:07:24.291 --> 01:07:25.671
I'll get my jacket.

01:07:25.751 --> 01:07:26.791
I'll be in the truck.

01:07:26.877 --> 01:07:28.382
Can I come, too, Daddy?

01:07:28.462 --> 01:07:29.758
No. You stay with Mummy.

01:07:29.838 --> 01:07:31.668
You've been out once today already.

01:07:31.798 --> 01:07:33.095
We'll walk over later, darling.

01:07:33.175 --> 01:07:34.625
Go and say goodbye.

01:07:46.646 --> 01:07:48.606
Daddy, why can't I come?

01:07:49.649 --> 01:07:51.279
I think he knows.

01:07:52.986 --> 01:07:54.276
How could he?

01:07:54.362 --> 01:07:56.032
I don't know. I just feel it.

01:07:56.490 --> 01:07:57.620
You feel guilty.

01:07:58.784 --> 01:07:59.954
Don't.

01:08:27.687 --> 01:08:29.017
My wife

01:08:29.481 --> 01:08:31.651
tells me you're a writer.

01:08:32.359 --> 01:08:33.447
Successful?

01:08:33.527 --> 01:08:34.948
Just beginning.

01:08:35.028 --> 01:08:36.608
Why aren't you in the forces?

01:08:36.696 --> 01:08:37.856
I was.

01:08:38.532 --> 01:08:39.952
I was wounded.

01:08:43.036 --> 01:08:44.286
So was I.

01:08:47.707 --> 01:08:50.127
- You married?
- No.

01:08:50.794 --> 01:08:52.054
Wise man.

01:08:53.630 --> 01:08:55.340
What I'd do with that freedom.

01:08:57.384 --> 01:08:59.890
I should think
you're very fortunate to have Lucy.

01:08:59.970 --> 01:09:02.220
Oh? Would you?

01:09:02.305 --> 01:09:03.675
Yes, I would.

01:09:08.395 --> 01:09:10.145
I used to fly Spitfires.

01:09:10.564 --> 01:09:12.363
Beautiful kites.

01:09:12.649 --> 01:09:13.987
Four guns on each wing.

01:09:14.067 --> 01:09:15.237
American Brownings.

01:09:15.318 --> 01:09:17.488
Fired 1,260 rounds a minute.

01:09:17.571 --> 01:09:18.741
Really?

01:09:19.573 --> 01:09:21.368
Aren't you interested in aircraft?

01:09:21.448 --> 01:09:22.488
No.

01:09:23.243 --> 01:09:25.912
I should have thought
you'd be an enthusiast.

01:09:26.496 --> 01:09:27.576
Why?

01:09:28.081 --> 01:09:30.504
It's become a national pastime, hasn't it?

01:09:30.584 --> 01:09:32.094
Aircraft spotting.

01:09:40.426 --> 01:09:41.796
Tom?

01:09:42.011 --> 01:09:43.011
Tom!

01:09:45.473 --> 01:09:47.773
You mind going inside, seeing if he's there?

01:09:48.768 --> 01:09:50.018
If he's not, we'll scout around.

01:09:50.103 --> 01:09:51.103
He won't be far.

01:09:52.606 --> 01:09:53.765
Tom!

01:10:30.227 --> 01:10:31.517
Tom!

01:10:37.359 --> 01:10:38.899
Is he in there?

01:10:39.819 --> 01:10:41.319
He's sleeping.

01:10:41.488 --> 01:10:44.488
Or rather, he's drunk himself unconscious.

01:10:45.951 --> 01:10:47.451
You lied to me, didn't you?

01:10:49.829 --> 01:10:51.499
What are you talking about?

01:10:51.665 --> 01:10:53.325
You said you weren't interested in aircraft.

01:10:54.167 --> 01:10:55.337
I'm not.

01:10:55.418 --> 01:10:56.998
Oh, but you are.

01:10:57.337 --> 01:10:59.207
Oh, you're very interested.

01:10:59.965 --> 01:11:01.255
Give me the film.

01:11:01.341 --> 01:11:02.341
What film?

01:11:02.425 --> 01:11:05.255
The can of film
I found in your pocket this morning.

01:11:05.512 --> 01:11:07.062
Yes, that's the one.

01:11:07.389 --> 01:11:09.568
On your knees.

01:11:10.183 --> 01:11:11.271
This is ridiculous.

01:11:11.351 --> 01:11:12.814
If this is because of Lucy...

01:11:12.894 --> 01:11:15.233
Those are photographs of our aircraft.
You've been spying.

01:11:15.313 --> 01:11:16.776
I work for the RAF.

01:11:16.856 --> 01:11:19.106
- I was delivering that film...
- Save it for Lucy.

01:11:19.401 --> 01:11:20.941
She'll be here soon.

01:11:21.027 --> 01:11:24.197
She's fascinated by everything
you've got to say, isn't she?

01:11:24.990 --> 01:11:26.410
Now bring me the film.

01:11:26.700 --> 01:11:28.200
On your knees.

01:11:44.509 --> 01:11:46.139
Give me the film.

01:11:46.594 --> 01:11:48.264
Give me the film.

01:14:00.687 --> 01:14:01.767
Hello!

01:14:01.855 --> 01:14:03.185
Hello.

01:14:07.819 --> 01:14:08.948
Hello, Jo.

01:14:09.028 --> 01:14:10.608
Hello.

01:14:10.697 --> 01:14:11.867
Hello.

01:14:11.990 --> 01:14:14.620
Hello. Where's David?

01:14:15.201 --> 01:14:16.371
Drunk.

01:14:18.580 --> 01:14:20.293
Let's go back home then, darling.

01:14:20.373 --> 01:14:21.503
Daddy's busy.

01:14:21.583 --> 01:14:22.883
Shall we?

01:14:23.376 --> 01:14:25.298
Was it all right? Did he say anything?

01:14:25.378 --> 01:14:26.628
Nothing.

01:14:26.921 --> 01:14:29.051
I'll go and collect him after supper.

01:14:29.841 --> 01:14:31.301
Come on, then!

01:15:06.294 --> 01:15:07.754
Jo's asleep.

01:15:07.921 --> 01:15:10.261
He said to say good night to you.

01:15:12.509 --> 01:15:14.049
What are you thinking?

01:15:15.094 --> 01:15:17.014
Do you realize what time it is?

01:15:18.723 --> 01:15:20.063
I must go.

01:15:21.935 --> 01:15:24.265
I must go and

01:15:24.771 --> 01:15:26.611
fetch your husband.

01:15:29.817 --> 01:15:31.437
You feel guilty.

01:15:32.779 --> 01:15:34.069
Don't.

01:17:16.674 --> 01:17:17.684
Godliman!

01:17:17.967 --> 01:17:19.087
Godliman here.

01:17:19.177 --> 01:17:21.387
<i>Godliman! I've had Churchill on the line,</i>

01:17:21.471 --> 01:17:23.221
breathing fire, not five minutes ago.

01:17:23.306 --> 01:17:25.878
- Listen, man...
<i>- Godliman!</i>

01:17:26.392 --> 01:17:28.392
<i>It's been decided. The tides are right.</i>

01:17:28.478 --> 01:17:29.808
<i>The buildup of troops is complete.</i>

01:17:30.146 --> 01:17:32.066
He must not get back to Germany.

01:17:32.565 --> 01:17:34.475
<i>Catch him or kill him.</i>

01:17:34.567 --> 01:17:35.777
Understood.

01:17:38.404 --> 01:17:39.744
Mummy?

01:19:29.098 --> 01:19:30.768
What the hell are you doing?

01:19:39.525 --> 01:19:41.685
Jo, we can make a drawing

01:19:42.278 --> 01:19:44.198
of all the things that the storm did.

01:19:44.697 --> 01:19:46.907
We could draw Mr. Baker's boat

01:19:47.158 --> 01:19:49.698
- against the rock, couldn't we?
- Mmm.

01:19:49.786 --> 01:19:53.247
And we could draw all the clouds,
all the black clouds that came out...

01:19:53.331 --> 01:19:54.331
Look, Jo.

01:19:54.791 --> 01:19:56.581
You can see the cliffs perfectly clearly.

01:19:56.667 --> 01:19:58.287
Can you see them?

01:19:58.795 --> 01:20:00.085
Aren't they pretty?

01:20:04.717 --> 01:20:06.217
Jo, darling, stay here. Don't move.

01:20:06.302 --> 01:20:07.552
And don't go near the cliff.

01:20:31.369 --> 01:20:32.499
My God!

01:20:46.092 --> 01:20:48.242
Oh, my God.

01:20:48.338 --> 01:20:50.143
Oh, my God.

01:20:53.015 --> 01:20:54.225
Oh, God.

01:20:58.479 --> 01:20:59.939
Oh, my God.

01:21:09.949 --> 01:21:11.779
Oh, my God, David.

01:21:14.412 --> 01:21:15.792
Help!

01:21:19.125 --> 01:21:20.455
Help!

01:21:21.627 --> 01:21:23.747
Somebody!

01:21:25.548 --> 01:21:28.054
Help!

01:21:28.134 --> 01:21:30.431
Somebody!

01:21:46.986 --> 01:21:49.106
What was in the water, Mummy?

01:21:52.241 --> 01:21:55.581
Jo, darling, Mummy has to go out now.

01:21:56.329 --> 01:21:59.418
You're going to be a good boy and stay here

01:21:59.498 --> 01:22:01.918
and play with your toys, will you?

01:22:04.253 --> 01:22:05.423
Henry!

01:22:08.090 --> 01:22:09.595
Where are you going, Mummy?

01:22:09.675 --> 01:22:11.755
I'm going over to Tom's, darling.

01:22:12.970 --> 01:22:15.640
Your husband refuses to come back.

01:22:18.351 --> 01:22:20.561
He and Tom have been drinking, and...

01:22:23.814 --> 01:22:25.234
Lucy?

01:22:28.986 --> 01:22:30.196
Oh, there you are.

01:22:30.738 --> 01:22:32.028
Have you been out?

01:22:34.700 --> 01:22:36.870
Yes. We were out walking.

01:22:39.789 --> 01:22:41.119
Would you like some coffee?

01:22:43.417 --> 01:22:46.087
We saw something in the water.

01:22:50.049 --> 01:22:52.049
We were looking at the wreck of your boat.

01:22:52.468 --> 01:22:54.638
Quite a mess, isn't it, Jo?

01:22:54.762 --> 01:22:56.262
Would you like some coffee?

01:22:57.014 --> 01:22:58.274
No, thank you.

01:23:09.735 --> 01:23:11.395
Have you just seen David?

01:23:11.612 --> 01:23:13.112
Just now, yes.

01:23:19.620 --> 01:23:22.580
Somehow, they've managed
to fix the aerial...

01:23:25.292 --> 01:23:26.422
Lucy?

01:23:43.185 --> 01:23:44.565
Here are the keys.

01:23:47.773 --> 01:23:49.533
Where are you going?

01:23:51.652 --> 01:23:53.902
I thought I'd better get David.

01:23:54.071 --> 01:23:56.371
He really mustn't drink so much.

01:23:57.241 --> 01:23:58.531
Oh, please, leave him.

01:23:58.784 --> 01:24:01.294
He told me to fetch him at teatime.
Leave him till then.

01:24:01.537 --> 01:24:02.750
Let's have a picnic.

01:24:02.830 --> 01:24:04.290
Shall we make some sandwiches, Jo?

01:24:04.498 --> 01:24:09.048
Once we went for a picnic
at the sea in spring.

01:24:09.128 --> 01:24:10.758
You'd enjoy that, wouldn't you?

01:24:10.838 --> 01:24:12.208
Yes, I'd like that very much.

01:24:13.507 --> 01:24:15.007
I do love you.

01:24:41.327 --> 01:24:44.827
<i>"'I am going to the house of death,'
said the swallow.</i>

01:24:45.956 --> 01:24:47.326
<i>"'Death is the brother of sleep,</i>

01:24:47.500 --> 01:24:48.921
"'is he not?'

01:24:49.001 --> 01:24:50.589
"And he kissed the happy prince

01:24:50.669 --> 01:24:53.259
"and fell down dead at his feet.

01:24:54.131 --> 01:24:58.051
"A curious crack sounded inside the statue,

01:24:58.677 --> 01:25:00.347
"as if something had broken.

01:25:01.847 --> 01:25:03.177
"The fact is

01:25:03.682 --> 01:25:05.522
"that the leaden heart had snapped

01:25:06.310 --> 01:25:07.520
"right in two.

01:25:08.854 --> 01:25:12.114
"'What a strange thing!' said the
overseer of the workmen at the foundry.

01:25:12.691 --> 01:25:15.361
"'This broken lead heart
will not melt in the furnace.'

01:25:15.736 --> 01:25:17.696
"So they threw it on the dustheap

01:25:17.780 --> 01:25:20.070
"where the dead swallow was also lying.

01:25:20.741 --> 01:25:24.540
"'Bring me the two most precious things
in the city,' said God.

01:25:24.620 --> 01:25:27.250
"The angel brought him the leaden heart

01:25:27.706 --> 01:25:29.416
"and the dead bird.

01:25:30.084 --> 01:25:32.384
"'You have rightly chosen,' said God.

01:25:32.670 --> 01:25:34.800
"'For in my garden of paradise,

01:25:34.880 --> 01:25:38.050
"'this little bird shall sing forevermore,

01:25:39.718 --> 01:25:41.468
"'and in my city of gold,

01:25:41.637 --> 01:25:44.597
""the happy prince shall praise me.""

01:25:45.224 --> 01:25:46.814
Come and have your milk, darling.

01:25:47.226 --> 01:25:48.689
I tell you what.

01:25:48.769 --> 01:25:50.229
If you're a very, very good boy

01:25:50.312 --> 01:25:51.812
and drink up all your milk,

01:25:51.897 --> 01:25:54.727
you can sleep in front of the fire tonight.

01:25:54.984 --> 01:25:56.072
Would you like that?

01:25:56.152 --> 01:25:57.156
Mmm.

01:25:57.236 --> 01:25:58.236
Yes.

01:27:15.981 --> 01:27:18.361
What islands did you say haven't reported?

01:27:18.442 --> 01:27:20.322
Sandevista, Uist and Storm,

01:27:20.402 --> 01:27:22.074
and that one's not worth worrying about.

01:27:22.154 --> 01:27:23.574
- Which?
- Storm Island.

01:27:23.656 --> 01:27:26.236
We can never raise Tom
in the evenings, can we, sir?

01:27:26.533 --> 01:27:28.581
Well, old Tom does like a little drink

01:27:28.661 --> 01:27:29.748
at the end of a hard day.

01:27:29.828 --> 01:27:31.828
How do I get onto these islands?

01:27:31.997 --> 01:27:33.167
In this weather?

01:27:38.671 --> 01:27:41.301
I'll go get us something to drink, shall I?

01:27:58.983 --> 01:28:00.613
I won't be a minute.

01:28:35.394 --> 01:28:36.564
Are you all right?

01:28:37.354 --> 01:28:38.864
Yes, I'm coming!

01:29:15.684 --> 01:29:17.939
Come along, darling.

01:30:10.739 --> 01:30:11.779
Come on!

01:30:11.949 --> 01:30:14.409
Please, God!

01:30:19.623 --> 01:30:20.833
Lucy!

01:32:11.735 --> 01:32:12.895
Tom!

01:32:18.909 --> 01:32:19.989
Tom!

01:32:33.882 --> 01:32:34.972
Tom!

01:32:57.948 --> 01:32:58.988
Tom?

01:33:03.787 --> 01:33:04.827
Tom!

01:33:12.129 --> 01:33:13.509
Oh, my God.

01:33:14.798 --> 01:33:16.378
Tom, you must wake up.

01:33:16.466 --> 01:33:17.626
It's Lucy.

01:33:18.010 --> 01:33:19.090
Tom?

01:33:27.311 --> 01:33:28.481
Oh, my God.

01:33:33.400 --> 01:33:34.610
Lucy!

01:33:46.038 --> 01:33:48.668
I'm trying to send an urgent...

01:33:49.458 --> 01:33:50.748
Hello?

01:33:50.876 --> 01:33:52.666
Please, if anyone hears me...

01:33:53.086 --> 01:33:56.046
Please, I'm sending
an urgent message from...

01:34:01.261 --> 01:34:02.431
Hello!

01:34:02.512 --> 01:34:03.809
Do you hear me?

01:34:03.889 --> 01:34:06.519
This is Storm Island sending an urgent SOS.

01:34:06.725 --> 01:34:09.225
Please, if you hear me,
could you let me know?

01:34:09.561 --> 01:34:12.021
And we are looking for any German vessel.

01:34:12.147 --> 01:34:13.567
It's probably a U-boat.

01:34:13.649 --> 01:34:15.819
When we return to refuel,

01:34:15.901 --> 01:34:18.201
the next squadron will
already be on its way.

01:34:19.071 --> 01:34:20.993
So, all we need is the weather, sir.

01:34:21.073 --> 01:34:22.323
Oh, to hell with the weather.

01:34:22.407 --> 01:34:23.829
Well, we can't take off in this fog.

01:34:23.909 --> 01:34:25.330
I know, I know, I know.

01:34:25.410 --> 01:34:27.874
- We've just picked up an SOS, sir.
- From where?

01:34:27.954 --> 01:34:29.124
We don't know yet.

01:34:29.206 --> 01:34:32.170
Hello? Are you receiving me? Over.

01:34:32.876 --> 01:34:35.586
Hello. Are you receiving me? Over.

01:34:41.635 --> 01:34:42.885
Lucy!

01:34:55.357 --> 01:34:56.527
Oh, my God!

01:35:14.292 --> 01:35:15.752
Lucy!

01:35:57.294 --> 01:35:58.344
No!

01:36:21.926 --> 01:36:24.111
Oh, no!

01:37:17.082 --> 01:37:18.378
Go back upstairs.

01:37:18.458 --> 01:37:21.088
Mummy, I'm cold.

01:37:22.838 --> 01:37:23.838
Run!

01:37:29.469 --> 01:37:30.599
Lucy?

01:37:32.138 --> 01:37:35.018
I know you don't have any shells left

01:37:35.642 --> 01:37:37.642
and I'm going to open the door.

01:37:38.520 --> 01:37:41.520
Please, I have to come in.

01:37:42.232 --> 01:37:44.992
I'm not going to hurt you, Lucy, I promise.

01:37:46.027 --> 01:37:47.777
But I am coming in.

01:37:49.739 --> 01:37:51.619
But I am coming in.

01:38:03.211 --> 01:38:05.671
Mummy! Mummy, help!

01:38:07.132 --> 01:38:08.682
I'm sorry.

01:38:09.559 --> 01:38:12.569
I'm sorry if I frightened you.

01:38:15.056 --> 01:38:17.386
I'm sorry. Are you all right?

01:38:18.643 --> 01:38:20.813
Everything's all right now.

01:38:21.605 --> 01:38:23.777
You're all right now. Come.

01:38:23.857 --> 01:38:25.317
We'll lock the door.

01:38:34.200 --> 01:38:35.580
This is Storm Island.

01:38:35.660 --> 01:38:37.870
Is there anyone there? Please?

01:38:37.954 --> 01:38:39.164
<i>Hello, Storm Island?</i>

01:38:39.247 --> 01:38:41.867
<i>We're receiving you loud and clear. Over.</i>

01:38:45.003 --> 01:38:46.424
<i>Hello, Storm Island.</i>

01:38:46.504 --> 01:38:49.514
<i>We've been trying
to raise you all night. Over.</i>

01:38:50.467 --> 01:38:52.547
<i>Come in, Storm Island. Over.</i>

01:38:55.013 --> 01:38:56.603
<i>Come in, Storm Island.</i>

01:38:57.515 --> 01:38:59.265
Let me talk to her.

01:39:02.103 --> 01:39:03.193
Hello. Can you hear me?

01:39:03.688 --> 01:39:05.268
<i>You're on to "receive."</i>

01:39:05.357 --> 01:39:06.820
<i>If you want to talk to me,</i>

01:39:06.900 --> 01:39:09.900
<i>say, "Over, " then switch to "transmit."</i>

01:39:09.986 --> 01:39:13.066
<i>I repeat, can you hear me? Over.</i>

01:39:15.408 --> 01:39:18.948
There was a man shipwrecked on our island.

01:39:19.371 --> 01:39:22.871
He killed my husband
and our shepherd, Tom.

01:39:23.208 --> 01:39:25.418
He's outside of the house now,

01:39:26.002 --> 01:39:28.800
so please come, for God's sake.

01:39:28.880 --> 01:39:29.880
Over.

01:39:32.008 --> 01:39:33.678
<i>We are on our way to you.</i>

01:39:37.222 --> 01:39:39.932
<i>Now, there's something I want you to do.</i>

01:39:40.350 --> 01:39:42.188
<i>It's absolutely essential.</i>

01:39:42.268 --> 01:39:45.228
<i>Are you hearing me clearly? Over.</i>

01:39:52.070 --> 01:39:54.820
Yes. I understand. Over.

01:39:55.740 --> 01:39:58.910
<i>You must destroy your radio. Over.</i>

01:40:03.999 --> 01:40:05.749
But why?

01:40:06.084 --> 01:40:07.424
Please, don't...

01:40:07.544 --> 01:40:09.594
No! I can't do that!

01:40:09.796 --> 01:40:12.916
I've got no one else here to help me!

01:40:19.681 --> 01:40:21.811
Jo, stay there.

01:41:01.139 --> 01:41:02.219
Jo!

01:41:18.990 --> 01:41:20.410
Put the gun there.

01:41:27.165 --> 01:41:28.455
Stand by the door.

01:41:57.529 --> 01:42:01.199
There's a bottle of whiskey
in the other room, Lucy.

01:42:02.951 --> 01:42:04.951
Would you bring it to me, please?

01:43:31.456 --> 01:43:33.876
General Patton's army...

01:43:50.391 --> 01:43:51.561
Good God.

01:44:00.735 --> 01:44:02.815
The war's come down to the two of us.

01:44:04.656 --> 01:44:06.276
Do you know that?

01:44:12.121 --> 01:44:14.001
I did what I had to do.

01:44:17.210 --> 01:44:19.170
And it cannot be undone.

01:44:22.966 --> 01:44:24.296
I'm sorry.

01:44:33.268 --> 01:44:34.518
Goodbye.

01:45:13.182 --> 01:45:14.352
Mummy!

01:45:14.434 --> 01:45:15.480
Mummy!

01:45:15.560 --> 01:45:18.316
Yes! It's all right, honey, it's all right.

01:45:18.396 --> 01:45:19.436
It's all right.

01:45:19.522 --> 01:45:22.192
Now, you must stay here.
Stay here, will you?

01:45:23.318 --> 01:45:24.778
Stay here and wait for Mummy.

01:46:38.810 --> 01:46:40.480
Stop!

01:46:47.902 --> 01:46:49.532
Please stop!

01:46:57.829 --> 01:46:59.329
Stop, please!

01:47:28.985 --> 01:47:30.525
Stop, please!
