02:58.719 --> 03:00.959
Dock five, the <i>Immaculata?</i>

03:01.129 --> 03:02.618
It's over there!

03:03.406 --> 03:04.855
Oh!

03:12.415 --> 03:14.667
I cannot, I repeat, cannot

03:14.792 --> 03:18.796
sit in this cesspool by the sea
with nothing to do.

03:19.000 --> 03:23.463
So, while you repair your silly boat
engines, I will do some remodelling.

03:23.588 --> 03:28.730
- I've sent for a carpenter.
- Whatever, diddums. I'm shooting skeet.

03:30.136 --> 03:32.013
Hello!

03:34.432 --> 03:37.602
Mr Stayton? Anybody home?

03:38.144 --> 03:40.855
- Hello!
- State your purpose!

03:40.980 --> 03:44.359
- Nice-looking Wetherby you got.
- It's a very expensive gun.

03:44.484 --> 03:47.695
- I have lots and lots of them.
- Somebody call for a carpenter?

03:47.821 --> 03:49.489
That's my wife's department.

03:49.614 --> 03:52.200
Could you tell me
where your wife might... be?

03:58.498 --> 04:01.084
You're the carpenter?

04:02.627 --> 04:04.879
Yeah. Dean Proffitt.

04:05.004 --> 04:07.048
You're late.

04:08.425 --> 04:10.677
- References?
- Well, no, not really.

04:10.802 --> 04:13.179
You see, I just moved up to this area...

04:13.304 --> 04:16.850
Hey, I've been doing this kind
of shit - work - for years.

04:16.975 --> 04:19.853
This is... This is just beautiful. Wow!

04:21.312 --> 04:23.898
- Try not to touch anything.
- Oh, I won't.

04:24.732 --> 04:27.193
Andrew will keep an eye on you.

04:27.318 --> 04:31.448
Maybe you'd like to take fingerprints
before I get started.

04:31.573 --> 04:33.616
I was just... kidding.

04:36.995 --> 04:39.747
Don't walk so close to me!

04:39.873 --> 04:41.708
OK! Where's your problem?

04:41.833 --> 04:43.626
- My closet.
- Uh-huh.

04:44.711 --> 04:46.754
In here.

04:47.380 --> 04:50.467
Now, you can see
how inadequate this all is.

04:50.592 --> 04:53.344
I need new shoe racks for my shoes.

04:53.470 --> 04:57.056
Uh, excuse me. I was told that
this was some kind of an emergency.

04:57.182 --> 04:59.476
It is.

04:59.601 --> 05:01.770
And I need drawers for my lingerie.

05:01.895 --> 05:05.982
I can't keep entering
these boxes all the time.

05:09.152 --> 05:10.737
Hello?

05:11.946 --> 05:16.659
Uh... Hey, I'm sorry. I understand now.
You want me to remodel your closet.

05:18.411 --> 05:22.290
Isn't that what I've been explaining
in some detail?

05:22.415 --> 05:24.542
Is English your second language?

05:26.669 --> 05:28.713
What is that odour?

05:30.965 --> 05:33.009
I don't smell anything.

05:33.843 --> 05:35.261
Madam.

05:35.762 --> 05:39.140
Well! I almost had to wait.

05:41.726 --> 05:45.021
I got an idea for a shoe rack
right in here maybe, huh?

05:48.525 --> 05:51.069
What <i>is</i> this gelatinous muck?!

05:51.903 --> 05:54.948
Andrew, when I tell you to pack staples,

05:55.073 --> 06:00.703
must I specify that you are to pack
good caviar and not this $1.99 fish bait!

06:00.829 --> 06:04.541
- Yes, madam.
- Caviar should be round and hard

06:04.666 --> 06:06.918
and of adequate size.

06:07.544 --> 06:11.464
And it should burst in your mouth
at <i>precisely</i> the right moment.

06:13.842 --> 06:14.843
Yes, madam.

06:14.968 --> 06:16.845
- Carpenter!
- Yeah?

06:16.970 --> 06:20.348
You have exactly 48 hours.
I suggest you get started.

06:21.933 --> 06:25.145
- Throw that out.
- Yes, madam.

06:27.230 --> 06:29.274
Watch him.

06:33.736 --> 06:36.281
<i>Mais oui! Bien sur!</i>

06:37.407 --> 06:38.616
<i>Oui?</i>

06:38.741 --> 06:41.202
<i>Ecoutez, Jean-Jacques</i>.
<i>Je vous telephone</i>...

06:41.327 --> 06:44.122
Oh, boy. She is really something!

06:44.247 --> 06:47.292
I know it will cost me,
but it's the cutest little painting.

06:47.417 --> 06:50.545
I simply must have it.
You'll do the bidding for me?

06:50.670 --> 06:52.255
But of course!

06:52.380 --> 06:55.425
- Bid 1,700,000.
- Shit!

06:57.177 --> 06:59.012
Grant, I'm on the phone!

06:59.137 --> 07:02.307
I can't hear you, tea rose!
I'm shooting skeet!

07:02.849 --> 07:04.058
- Pull!
- Pull!

07:04.184 --> 07:05.852
Firing!

07:20.909 --> 07:21.993
Hello.

07:44.557 --> 07:47.727
Forks were invented so man
could at least make a pretence

07:47.852 --> 07:51.773
- of separating himself from the apes.
- So were thumbs.

07:52.607 --> 07:57.195
- What did you say?
- Nothin'. Just... my stomach.

07:57.737 --> 08:01.449
Well, try to control your bodily noises
so I can hear myself think!

08:07.163 --> 08:09.791
<i>And another</i>
<i>Oregon good morning to you</i>.

08:09.916 --> 08:12.293
<i>Wilbur Budd here with some local items</i>.

08:12.418 --> 08:16.923
<i>The Fraga Feed and Fertilizer folks</i>
<i>are hiring people to shovel the stuff</i>.

08:17.048 --> 08:21.678
<i>Oh, women are welcome, too. There's</i>
<i>no chauvinism in the manure business</i>.

08:22.262 --> 08:25.598
These gnats keep landing
on my wet nail polish.

08:25.723 --> 08:29.894
I guess I'm supposed to walk around with
their little corpses stuck to my fingers.

08:30.019 --> 08:32.313
- Joanna, please!
- It's easy for you to say!

08:32.438 --> 08:36.484
You don't have to sit out here in the brine
with your perm frizzing to oblivion.

08:36.609 --> 08:38.570
I look like a bushman.

08:38.695 --> 08:41.905
Why don't you go inside
and get out of the sea air?

08:42.030 --> 08:46.453
Because that Elk Snout mountain man
is still working on my closet.

08:46.578 --> 08:48.621
He's sweating all over the place.

08:48.746 --> 08:50.790
I doubt if he's even housebroken.

08:50.915 --> 08:53.960
- Oh, I think they housebreak each other...
- Ssh!

08:54.502 --> 08:56.546
- What?
- He's listening.

08:56.671 --> 08:58.757
- Who?
- That carpenter.

08:58.882 --> 09:02.093
He's been hanging on our every word
for the last two days.

09:02.218 --> 09:05.180
It's your project, Joanna. You deal with it.

09:07.056 --> 09:09.684
- Come along, men.
- The engines are ready, sir.

09:09.809 --> 09:11.853
Well, let's get going.

09:12.020 --> 09:15.523
I've finished, madam.
Shall I put your jewellery back on you?

09:15.648 --> 09:16.733
No.

09:17.358 --> 09:19.444
I'm still tacky.

09:32.749 --> 09:36.961
Keep quiet for ten more minutes, collect
the money and get the hell outta here.

09:37.086 --> 09:39.380
Well! Are we amusing you?

09:40.381 --> 09:44.052
- What... is this?
- Uh, well, I'm done. I'm finished.

09:44.177 --> 09:46.554
- Uh... What do you think?
- What is it?

09:46.679 --> 09:49.933
Well, it's a shoe rack... with a twist.
Uh... You ready?

09:50.058 --> 09:55.021
Just turn the crank here, those drop back,
these split. Gives you twice the space...

09:55.146 --> 09:58.191
Stop boring me with your absurdities.
What's it made of?

09:58.316 --> 10:00.360
It's called wood. It's oak.

10:00.568 --> 10:02.862
Oak. An oak closet?

10:02.987 --> 10:04.948
Huh! Why am I even amazed?

10:05.073 --> 10:07.367
I don't know. Why are you amazed?

10:07.492 --> 10:12.497
One would think you would know closets
are made of cedar. If not, we get moths.

10:12.622 --> 10:16.501
Well, lady, there's not a real big
moth problem off the Pacific coast.

10:16.626 --> 10:20.046
But if you want one out of cedar,
that's fine. I'll start all over.

10:20.171 --> 10:23.925
I just have to tell ya that's gonna
more than double my estimate.

10:24.050 --> 10:28.847
- What do you mean?
- I've already done this out of oak, so...

10:28.972 --> 10:33.184
- I'm not paying for your mistake!
- I'm not just gonna eat it on this deal.

10:33.309 --> 10:35.603
Why not?
You've eaten everything else here.

10:35.728 --> 10:37.897
And you will eat it
because I wanted cedar!

10:38.022 --> 10:40.775
You may have <i>wanted</i> cedar,
but you didn't <i>ask</i> for it.

10:40.900 --> 10:43.862
The entire civilised world
knows closets are made of cedar!

10:43.987 --> 10:47.282
In Elk Snout,
we don't know about them closets!

10:47.407 --> 10:51.578
Nor bathrooms, neither! Shit, woman!
You're lucky I <i>am</i> housebroke!

10:52.662 --> 10:55.582
- You were listening.
- Well, it was kinda hard to avoid.

10:55.707 --> 10:59.169
- You can avoid it now - you're fired!
- You're unbelievable!

10:59.294 --> 11:03.006
That's fine with me!
Just pay me the money you owe me.

11:04.424 --> 11:07.969
- The job was not done to my satisfaction!
- I got news for you, lady!

11:08.094 --> 11:10.597
No job will ever be done
to your satisfaction!

11:10.722 --> 11:12.766
That's quite enough! Now, just get out!

11:12.891 --> 11:15.685
No problem! Pay me the <i>6</i> 00 bucks
you owe me and I'm gone!

11:15.810 --> 11:17.854
Captain Karl! Start up the engine!

11:20.940 --> 11:22.859
You know what your problem is? Huh?

11:22.984 --> 11:26.362
You're so goddamn bored,
you gotta invent things to bitch about.

11:26.488 --> 11:29.532
You haven't got a single thing to do
except for your hair.

11:29.657 --> 11:31.493
Yeah! The closet was fine!

11:31.618 --> 11:34.788
You just needed somethin'
to take up your useless, empty,

11:34.913 --> 11:39.334
nail-polishing, toe-polishing,
rich-bitch, sun tanning days!

11:43.505 --> 11:45.715
- Don't touch me!
- What?

11:47.926 --> 11:48.927
Hey, lady.

11:49.052 --> 11:54.140
I may be hard up, but I am not that
hard up. And I'm not goin' anywhere...

11:54.808 --> 11:56.851
Hey!

11:58.478 --> 12:00.605
- Damn you!
- Man overboard!

12:00.730 --> 12:02.774
I'll get you for this, you...

12:02.899 --> 12:06.486
Not my tool belt! You owe me <i>6</i> 00 bucks!

12:06.986 --> 12:09.739
- Keep going!
- As you wish.

12:11.699 --> 12:14.702
If I ever get you, lady, you're dead meat!
You got that?

12:14.828 --> 12:16.871
No, don't throw that!

12:19.040 --> 12:21.876
I'm not bored! I'm quite happy!

12:22.001 --> 12:24.045
Everyone wants to be me!

12:24.712 --> 12:27.590
You come back here!

12:28.883 --> 12:30.802
I lost all my tools.

12:30.927 --> 12:34.055
I'll loan you some tools.
We'll get you some part-time work.

12:34.180 --> 12:37.100
I need a steady job.
What about that night-time thing?

12:37.225 --> 12:41.521
I'm working on it. Listen, pretty soon,
we'll get that miniature golf course deal.

12:41.646 --> 12:43.690
If I can hang on that long.

12:46.985 --> 12:49.028
He called you a what?

12:50.113 --> 12:53.450
Joanna, why are you so upset?

12:53.575 --> 12:58.580
Why in the world do you care what some
carpenter from Elk Snout thinks of you?

12:59.122 --> 13:01.166
I'm sure I'm just premenstrual.

13:01.291 --> 13:05.420
Then you must go right back to bed
for at least two days.

13:06.087 --> 13:09.674
Inga, you don't shove the food
down Shiitake's throat.

13:09.799 --> 13:13.928
You place it on her tongue.
Don't they have dogs in Sweden?

13:14.387 --> 13:16.431
Grant mentioned having a baby again.

13:17.307 --> 13:19.434
<i>What should I do?</i>

13:19.559 --> 13:23.062
<i>Darling, if you have a baby,</i>

13:23.188 --> 13:25.231
you won't be the baby any more.

13:26.024 --> 13:27.358
True.

13:27.484 --> 13:30.528
<i>Well, I must go. Bye-bye, Mommy</i>.

13:30.653 --> 13:32.322
Bye-bye, sweetie.

13:33.198 --> 13:35.241
I'm not a bitch.

13:40.330 --> 13:42.874
Andrew!
Are you going to bring me my lemon

13:42.999 --> 13:45.794
or do I have to squeeze it from my hat?

13:50.799 --> 13:53.343
Hey, guys, I'm home!

13:54.928 --> 13:58.807
Stay away, you wolves! No! Shoo!

13:58.932 --> 14:00.975
Bad dogs! Go away!

14:01.101 --> 14:04.270
Buster! Jackson! Get back inside!

14:05.855 --> 14:07.899
- Are you Mr Proffitt?
- Yeah!

14:08.024 --> 14:11.778
You look like the morning after
Halloween. Probably had a day like I did.

14:11.903 --> 14:15.323
- What happened to you?
- Monday is their first day of school

14:15.448 --> 14:19.911
and I came here to welcome your family.
And what do I get in return?

14:20.036 --> 14:23.790
- I get toilet-papered by your children!
- They're just playin' around!

14:23.915 --> 14:28.461
Just playin' around? They were about
to douse the toilet paper with gasoline

14:28.586 --> 14:30.630
- and strike...
- Wait, wait! Stop.

14:30.755 --> 14:33.007
- Greg and Charlie. Twins, right?
- Yeah.

14:33.133 --> 14:37.429
They're having this arson period. They
don't know this, but I'm ahead of them.

14:37.554 --> 14:39.889
I got two fire extinguishers ready to go.

14:40.014 --> 14:42.475
- I didn't catch your name.
- Adele Burbridge.

14:42.600 --> 14:44.894
- Nice to meet you.
- Principal of the Elk Cove school.

14:45.019 --> 14:49.023
- Your children are monsters!
- You won't think that once you know 'em!

14:49.149 --> 14:53.945
- Where is Mrs Proffitt during all of this?
- She died three years ago.

14:56.072 --> 15:01.327
Mr Proffitt, your children are totally
lacking in parental supervision.

15:01.453 --> 15:04.664
Hey, you don't have to tell <i>me</i>
these kids are lucky.

15:04.789 --> 15:08.293
Fine. You can joke all you want,
but I am serious about this.

15:08.418 --> 15:13.339
If you don't do something,
I am going to notify the proper authorities.

15:13.465 --> 15:16.801
I have had baby-sitters in here
by the dozen, but...

15:16.926 --> 15:18.970
I'm... I'm kinda low on cash right now.

15:19.095 --> 15:23.308
I'm new in town, but if I get a chance
I'll hire a housekeeper, all right?

15:23.433 --> 15:26.436
I'll believe it when I see it.
Good day, Mr Proffitt!

15:28.271 --> 15:30.315
I'm a good father!

15:31.691 --> 15:33.735
Ah, what do you know?

15:47.415 --> 15:50.043
Joanna, I want you tonight.

15:50.168 --> 15:52.962
How can you have your period
every week?!

15:53.088 --> 15:58.093
<i>You can stow away with the rich</i>
<i>and famous to exotic ports of call</i>...

15:58.259 --> 16:00.678
Must you watch that thing incessantly?

16:00.804 --> 16:05.475
Yes, I must. It has a tawdry escapist
quality that soothes my nerves.

16:05.600 --> 16:09.145
What you have to escape from,
I can't possibly imagine.

16:10.188 --> 16:13.233
Grant! I left my wedding ring on the deck.

16:13.358 --> 16:16.861
- Well, what can <i>I</i> do?
- Go and get it.

16:16.986 --> 16:20.573
- It's after midnight!
- I don't care what time it is. I want it now!

16:20.698 --> 16:23.952
I want to see who's in the top ten yachts.

16:24.077 --> 16:26.621
- I'll get it!
- OK.

16:28.164 --> 16:31.292
<i>A countdown to the world's</i>
<i>ten best luxury yachts</i>.

16:31.417 --> 16:34.462
<i>This is the big league of the seven seas</i>.

16:34.587 --> 16:39.592
<i>The one purchase that separates</i>
<i>mere millionaires from multimillionaires</i>.

16:39.717 --> 16:42.512
<i>Our number ten pick</i>
<i>is the Loca Rohan,</i>

16:42.637 --> 16:47.183
<i>a 167-foot Saudi-owned dreamboat,</i>
<i>docked in Tahiti</i>.

16:47.308 --> 16:49.352
<i>Number nine, the 230</i>...

17:06.493 --> 17:08.538
Andrew!

17:13.835 --> 17:15.377
Grant!

17:20.842 --> 17:22.801
Oh, my hair!

17:22.926 --> 17:24.304
Help!

17:26.473 --> 17:29.559
Grant! Help!

17:30.977 --> 17:34.355
Stop! You idiots!

17:37.317 --> 17:41.654
Another Oregon good morning to you!
This is Wilbur Budd here at KRAB,

17:41.780 --> 17:45.658
the family station,
run by me and my family.

17:45.784 --> 17:49.829
Sorry to interrupt the movie, but we got
some excitement in Tillamook County.

17:49.954 --> 17:53.750
I've got a bulletin for the eyewitness,
on-the-spot KRAB newsroom.

17:53.875 --> 17:56.086
It seems a mystery woman
was picked up

17:56.211 --> 17:59.380
by the Elk Cove garbage scow
shortly after midnight.

17:59.506 --> 18:02.383
They fished her out of the water
and she's conscious,

18:02.509 --> 18:05.637
but the problem is she seems
to be suffering from amnesia.

18:05.762 --> 18:08.264
She has no recollection of who she is.

18:08.389 --> 18:11.309
<i>My wife Rose is with</i>
<i>the captain of the garbage scow</i>

18:11.434 --> 18:13.353
<i>that picked up the mystery lady</i>.

18:13.478 --> 18:15.396
- <i>Rose?</i>
- Mr Tunatti.

18:15.522 --> 18:19.651
Can you tell us what the woman was like
when you brought her aboard?

18:19.776 --> 18:24.364
Yes. We saw something float in water
like this. Just like that, just like that.

18:24.489 --> 18:27.784
We didn't know it... We bring... on board.

18:27.909 --> 18:30.662
- On board.
- Yes. We say... <i>foca!</i>

18:30.787 --> 18:33.081
Excuse me,
you can't say that on television!

18:33.206 --> 18:35.041
No, no, no, no!

18:35.166 --> 18:37.836
<i>Foca! Foca!</i>
<i>Foca</i> means seal in <i>portugues!</i>

18:37.961 --> 18:40.213
- Oh, I see!
- Seal, seal! So we bring...

18:40.338 --> 18:43.758
- You learn something every day!
- No clothes. Just a little thing.

18:43.883 --> 18:48.263
- <i>There you have it. Thank you, Tunatti</i>.
- <i>Thank you</i>.

18:48.388 --> 18:50.432
<i>Garbage I do for money. For love, I sing</i>.

18:50.557 --> 18:53.059
- <i>In my country, I sing</i>.
- <i>Isn't that interesting?</i>

18:55.186 --> 19:00.150
- <i>We have a Renaissance garbageman</i>.
- <i>We tell stories with our songs</i>.

19:00.275 --> 19:02.110
<i>Thank you, Rose</i>.

19:02.235 --> 19:05.447
<i>Arnie, can we roll that tape now, please?</i>

19:06.030 --> 19:10.201
<i>Now, folks. Here's an interview</i>
<i>we taped earlier at the hospital</i>.

19:10.326 --> 19:13.246
<i>Miss, miss</i>... <i>do you know your name?</i>

19:13.371 --> 19:15.415
<i>Of course I know my name!</i>

19:16.374 --> 19:18.042
<i>It's</i>...

19:18.168 --> 19:20.211
<i>Oh! This is absurd!</i>

19:20.920 --> 19:22.964
<i>I know it! It</i>...

19:23.548 --> 19:25.592
<i>Get that thing out of my face!</i>

19:26.885 --> 19:28.928
<i>What a horrible wig!</i>

19:39.147 --> 19:43.651
You mean to tell me
that I have no medical recourse?

19:44.402 --> 19:47.030
- Can she see us?
- Not unless she's Superwoman.

19:47.155 --> 19:52.243
Well, what do you know? Extend
your brain a teensy little bit, if possible!

19:52.368 --> 19:55.914
You seem to be suffering
from a temporary amnesia,

19:56.039 --> 20:00.251
either from the bump into the garbage
scow or the shock of the cold water.

20:00.376 --> 20:02.962
- How temporary is it?
- Well, we don't know.

20:03.088 --> 20:06.174
Otherwise, you seem to be
in excellent physical shape.

20:06.299 --> 20:08.343
Listen to me, medical people.

20:08.468 --> 20:12.764
As of now, I have a life history
of a dirty garbage scow

20:12.889 --> 20:16.392
and a breakfast of
extremely runny eggs over easy!

20:16.518 --> 20:19.813
Now I refuse... refuse...

20:20.688 --> 20:24.067
to be incarcerated in this
semi-private room!

20:24.192 --> 20:26.069
You snore!

20:26.194 --> 20:28.780
No efforts are being made
for anyone to locate...

20:28.905 --> 20:29.948
Is that her?

20:31.032 --> 20:34.077
<i>I demand you do something!</i>
<i>Do you hear me?</i>

20:34.202 --> 20:36.663
No! I never saw her before in my life.

20:38.665 --> 20:42.377
Mrs Stayton has decided
to leave me. Let's celebrate!

20:44.546 --> 20:48.758
Now, Miss, uh... X, we have
a comfortable private room for you

20:48.883 --> 20:53.680
where you'll be safer, we'll all be safer,
and you'll be a lot more comfortable.

20:53.805 --> 20:57.267
Well, I'm glad you've <i>finally</i>
come to your senses!

20:57.392 --> 20:59.394
I was prepared to sue you.

20:59.519 --> 21:02.605
I don't know who I am,
but I'm sure I have a lawyer.

21:12.449 --> 21:16.202
- Hey, you about done?
- Yeah! I think I got it fixed.

21:16.327 --> 21:19.330
- Your lunch is on the counter.
- Thanks.

21:19.456 --> 21:21.833
<i>Hi, this is Wilbur Budd</i>.
<i>We got some more</i>

21:21.958 --> 21:25.211
<i>on that amnesia lady story</i>
<i>down there in Elk Grove</i>.

21:25.336 --> 21:27.380
<i>Wanna push in on these, Barry, please?</i>

21:27.505 --> 21:31.009
Uh, I saw some potato chips
around the corner. Could I just...?

21:31.134 --> 21:33.178
OK, one bag!

21:33.303 --> 21:38.516
<i>I said Elk Grove before. You know</i>
<i>I meant Elk Cove. Anything new, honey?</i>

21:38.641 --> 21:42.604
<i>The mystery woman is still suffering</i>
<i>from complete but temporary amnesia</i>.

21:42.729 --> 21:47.400
<i>If you know the identity of this</i>
<i>woman, please contact Elk Cove Hospital</i>.

21:47.525 --> 21:50.653
<i>I'll put up the reward myself</i>.
<i>She's drivin' us crazy</i>.

21:50.779 --> 21:52.906
- <i>Thank you. Back to Wilbur</i>...
- Yo, Dean!

21:55.366 --> 21:58.995
- <i>She's not the nicest person around</i>...
- Look at this!

21:59.120 --> 22:02.749
<i>She made some remarks about</i>
<i>Rose's hair, which I didn't care for</i>.

22:02.874 --> 22:05.919
<i>In any event, there she is</i>
<i>and this is what she looks like</i>.

22:06.044 --> 22:07.629
- That's her.
- Who?

22:07.754 --> 22:09.589
The bitch!

22:09.714 --> 22:14.511
<i>Earlier today, one man arrived on</i>
<i>the scene to make an identification, but</i>...

22:14.636 --> 22:17.680
I can't believe it. He's skippin' out on her.

22:17.806 --> 22:20.558
Course he is! It's his shot at freedom.

22:20.683 --> 22:23.228
We should go and see
if we can get your money back.

22:23.353 --> 22:25.396
- Look, he's gone!
- Not him, her!

22:26.689 --> 22:31.361
She doesn't know who she is. Do you
think she's gonna know who I am?

22:36.074 --> 22:40.620
- Billy, there is a God and he loves me.
- You're not gonna shave your head?

22:40.745 --> 22:42.038
No.

22:42.664 --> 22:44.707
- Dean...
- I gotta go talk to my kids.

22:44.833 --> 22:47.502
I want you to take 'em shopping
at the Salvation Army.

22:47.627 --> 22:49.879
This is illegal! Dean, you're crazy!

22:53.508 --> 22:55.969
I wondered if a woman like that
had a husband.

22:56.094 --> 22:59.764
- Oh, yeah! She does!
- Here's some effects you may recognise.

22:59.889 --> 23:00.974
Oh, yeah.

23:01.099 --> 23:04.811
Nice panties. Some initials here,
she didn't know what they meant. JS.

23:04.936 --> 23:08.690
She wouldn't cos, see,
I bought these for her at a garage sale.

23:08.815 --> 23:12.026
- I bought my wife a garter at a yard sale.
- I bet you did.

23:12.152 --> 23:15.155
- Hey, what else you got in here?
- I got some pictures.

23:15.280 --> 23:17.740
We were gonna wire them,
but now you're here...

23:17.866 --> 23:20.118
Yeah! That's her.

23:21.911 --> 23:24.164
Oh, yeah. That's my little cookie-cutter.

23:24.289 --> 23:26.624
- Quite a beauty!
- She's somethin', isn't she?

23:26.750 --> 23:29.127
You got that right!

23:29.252 --> 23:31.212
Doc. We got a winner.

23:51.441 --> 23:52.942
Annie!

23:54.110 --> 23:56.154
Stop!

23:57.363 --> 23:59.324
I don't recognise this man.

23:59.449 --> 24:02.118
Your wife's had an almost
total loss of memory.

24:02.243 --> 24:05.997
I-I can't believe
she doesn't know her own husband!

24:07.916 --> 24:10.460
This missing-link person
is not my husband!

24:10.585 --> 24:12.962
Oh, Annie, please!

24:13.088 --> 24:16.174
- Annie. Annie.
- Right.

24:16.299 --> 24:18.259
That's not right. That's not my name!

24:18.384 --> 24:21.679
This is completely crazy! Honey, sit down.

24:21.805 --> 24:26.184
Everything's gonna be OK.
Now... I <i>am</i> your husband.

24:26.309 --> 24:28.353
My name is Dean Proffitt.

24:29.479 --> 24:31.689
We've been married for 13 years.

24:31.815 --> 24:33.441
Wait!

24:33.566 --> 24:37.070
I admit I have forgotten numerous things.

24:37.195 --> 24:41.032
But I truly, from the depths of my soul,
do not remember you!

24:41.157 --> 24:44.035
Don't you think
there'd be some spark of recognition?

24:44.160 --> 24:47.455
- We don't know.
- Maybe you'll spark to this!

24:54.003 --> 24:57.674
Ugh! I don't believe this!
He could be some stranger off the street!

24:57.799 --> 25:00.176
Well, he seems to like you
and he's a nice guy.

25:00.301 --> 25:01.886
- He's good-lookin'.
- Clean.

25:02.679 --> 25:04.722
- What's my full name?
- Oh, come on!

25:04.848 --> 25:07.308
- What is it?
- Mrs Annie Proffitt!

25:07.434 --> 25:11.146
- What's my maiden name?
- Annie... Goolihy.

25:12.147 --> 25:14.190
Annie Goolihy?

25:14.315 --> 25:16.651
Where in God's name did I grow up?
Dogpatch?

25:16.776 --> 25:21.906
No, no, not there! Over in Goober, Idaho.
But it's a nuclear waste dump now...

25:22.031 --> 25:24.534
- Where did I meet you?
- Hank's Donut World.

25:24.659 --> 25:28.163
Seattle? You hung out there every night
when you were in the Navy!

25:28.288 --> 25:30.623
- You remember...
- I was in the armed forces?

25:30.749 --> 25:33.209
I've still got your postcards
from Okinawa...

25:33.334 --> 25:36.004
Stop. The Navy?

25:36.129 --> 25:37.630
Oh, come on, honey!

25:37.756 --> 25:39.924
You gotta know! You were in the Navy!

25:40.049 --> 25:43.887
No, I don't know! I don't know
any of this and I don't know you!

25:45.013 --> 25:47.056
I need some proof!

25:47.932 --> 25:49.976
Stop staring at me!

25:50.685 --> 25:52.729
Eat your chequers!

25:52.854 --> 25:58.109
Look, if it were up to us, we'd be glad
to give her to you, but she's right.

25:58.234 --> 26:00.236
I'm gonna need some verification.

26:00.361 --> 26:03.782
Oh, listen... I know what you mean.
I understand. Now...

26:04.699 --> 26:08.870
I don't like to talk about this in public,
and I've never told anybody...

26:08.995 --> 26:14.417
She does have a small
strawberry-like birthmark, uh...

26:14.542 --> 26:16.920
It's kinda high up on her... left cheek

26:17.045 --> 26:19.923
and it's unique.

26:39.442 --> 26:41.694
Come to Daddy!

26:57.460 --> 27:00.046
Mister!
What was I doing out in the ocean?

27:01.548 --> 27:06.428
Um... That's something you like to do.
You know, divin' for oysters at night.

27:06.553 --> 27:09.973
Sometimes you get pretty far
from the shore and that undertow...

27:10.098 --> 27:14.394
Oysters? In a cold ocean at night?
That doesn't sound like me.

27:19.941 --> 27:21.985
I just... ate a bug!

27:25.196 --> 27:29.492
Keep your mouth closed!
A lot of things flying around out here.

27:49.721 --> 27:52.307
Welcome home, baby!

27:53.057 --> 27:55.101
I feel faint.

27:57.937 --> 28:00.440
Come on, Buster! Come on, Jackson!

28:01.107 --> 28:03.818
No. This is wrong.

28:03.943 --> 28:07.030
Come along, now.
We've only been here a couple of weeks.

28:07.155 --> 28:12.410
A lot of stuff's in boxes from the move,
so I hardly recognise the place myself.

28:12.535 --> 28:15.622
We moved here... deliberately?

28:19.542 --> 28:21.586
Our last place was a real dump.

28:24.547 --> 28:25.548
Come on.

28:28.802 --> 28:31.054
Our new palace!

28:38.853 --> 28:40.146
Well!

28:40.271 --> 28:44.275
Let me, uh... Let me show you around.
Maybe something'll come back to you.

28:45.944 --> 28:49.447
- Did I just go downhill?
- Look at that. It's comin' back already.

28:49.572 --> 28:52.283
Everything slants down here
toward the bedroom.

28:52.408 --> 28:56.121
Dining room and toilet... Only one.

28:57.247 --> 29:01.167
And here we are at the old,
uh... magic room.

29:02.168 --> 29:04.295
Put a lot of miles on that mattress, huh?

29:05.463 --> 29:06.756
Later.

29:06.881 --> 29:10.218
All right! Here's where we have
breakfast every morning.

29:10.343 --> 29:12.303
Let's go up...

29:12.429 --> 29:14.389
Oh-ho! Here they come!

29:18.101 --> 29:21.938
- Charlie tried to kill my turtle!
- He didn't. It slipped out of his hands!

29:22.063 --> 29:24.524
- He did!
- Hey, hey, guys! Whoa!

29:24.649 --> 29:27.152
Whoa! Hey, look who's home!

29:27.694 --> 29:30.071
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi, Mom.

29:30.196 --> 29:33.408
Gee, Mom! We really missed you.

29:33.533 --> 29:36.578
We're so glad you're back.

29:37.704 --> 29:40.457
They're... They're not mine.

29:40.582 --> 29:44.043
Oh, honey!
I was sure you'd remember them!

29:44.919 --> 29:47.547
Well, I think I'd remember if I had three...

29:47.672 --> 29:50.133
<i>Four,</i> honey! Don't forget little Joe.

29:54.053 --> 29:56.347
Well, that's about it except for...

30:01.853 --> 30:04.939
Hey, she's been in there an hour.
What did you guys get her?

30:05.064 --> 30:07.108
- Dresses.
- The right sizes?

30:07.233 --> 30:09.861
You didn't tell us.
You just said get some dresses.

30:09.986 --> 30:12.363
OK, on the couch.
Come on, guys, don't blow it.

30:12.489 --> 30:14.157
Hey, a dirty magazine!

30:14.908 --> 30:16.951
Baby doll!

30:18.161 --> 30:21.873
This garment cannot possibly
be a part of my wardrobe.

30:21.998 --> 30:25.168
Let's forget for a moment that it's a rag,

30:25.293 --> 30:27.754
but it happens to be 12 sizes too large.

30:27.879 --> 30:31.508
- It's... It's not that bad.
- Not that bad?

30:31.633 --> 30:36.387
Well, come on, honey. You gotta
admit, you've lost a lot of weight.

30:36.513 --> 30:38.807
Huh? You used to be like a balloon!

30:41.726 --> 30:43.770
- Was I also shorter?
- Yes!

30:43.937 --> 30:48.691
Yes, you had a bad back. You walked
kinda hunched over, you know?

30:52.862 --> 30:54.989
I was short <i>and</i> fat?

30:56.282 --> 30:58.910
Look, I'm sure you've got
a million questions.

30:59.035 --> 31:02.997
You've been through hell. So, let's
just take this thing one step at a time.

31:03.123 --> 31:04.999
First, let's meet the boys.

31:05.125 --> 31:09.504
In the middle we've got the twins - Greg
and Charlie. He likes to invent things.

31:09.629 --> 31:12.924
- Twins?
- Yeah. Obviously, they're not identical.

31:13.049 --> 31:16.386
- Or I'd look like a shithead!
- Who asked you, butthole?!

31:17.053 --> 31:19.889
They came out fighting
and they're still at it!

31:20.014 --> 31:21.474
Guys, guys!

31:21.599 --> 31:25.687
Charlie and I get along very well, Mom.
My twin brother and I are best friends.

31:25.812 --> 31:27.522
He's the actor in the family.

31:27.647 --> 31:31.234
Then we got the big guy!
11 pounds 5 ounces.

31:31.359 --> 31:34.279
Come on, honey, give it a try.
What's his name?

31:39.284 --> 31:40.702
Roy?

31:44.205 --> 31:47.375
No. Travis. Sweet Trav?

31:47.500 --> 31:49.627
- Now, those are tits!
- My turn!

31:49.753 --> 31:51.838
Hey, what are you...?

31:54.758 --> 31:57.886
I was hopin' you'd recall this guy.
He's your newest, honey.

31:58.011 --> 32:00.472
Hi, Mom! My name's Joe.

32:01.055 --> 32:04.559
- A falsetto child?
- Ah, he thinks he's Pee Wee Herman.

32:04.684 --> 32:06.936
I love Pee Wee Herman. Ha ha!

32:07.061 --> 32:09.355
- Give your ma a kiss.
- No! No! No!

32:11.149 --> 32:13.359
Do they have a problem
with their glands?

32:13.485 --> 32:17.238
Hey, hey, guys, easy! Come on!

32:17.363 --> 32:19.616
It's not us, Dad, it's Roy!

32:22.243 --> 32:24.662
Ah, they're great boys, aren't they?

32:24.788 --> 32:26.664
There's so many of them.

32:26.790 --> 32:29.959
You've always had
your heart set on six, so...

32:30.085 --> 32:32.128
we'll just keep on tryin'.

32:32.754 --> 32:35.048
Dad! They're making me drink blood!

32:35.715 --> 32:38.718
- Come back here!
- No, no, no!

32:39.469 --> 32:41.679
They don't look anything like me!

32:41.805 --> 32:45.850
They do take after your mother. Let's
hope they don't grow up to be lushes, too.

32:46.601 --> 32:48.728
- My mother's a lush?
- Was, honey.

32:48.853 --> 32:51.356
- Cirrhosis.
- She's...?

32:53.900 --> 32:56.903
- What about my father?
- Oh, he's alive and well.

32:57.028 --> 33:00.990
- And due for parole in, what, two years?
- Oh, God! I don't wanna hear any more!

33:01.116 --> 33:03.493
- Look...
- I just wanna remember for myself.

33:03.618 --> 33:07.497
The doctor says the best thing for you
is to get back to your normal routine.

33:07.622 --> 33:11.668
You gotta get your memory back that
way. You gotta do what you normally do.

33:12.669 --> 33:15.171
What is it I normally do?

33:16.131 --> 33:18.967
I prepared and handled raw food?

33:20.301 --> 33:23.221
I hunt it. You cook it.

33:23.346 --> 33:26.099
- You shot a chicken?
- Come on, honey!

33:26.224 --> 33:28.351
Save the jokes! We're starvin' here.

33:28.476 --> 33:29.894
Yeah!

33:30.019 --> 33:32.313
It's strange, but... ooh!

33:33.440 --> 33:36.151
I feel as if I've never done this
before in my life.

33:36.276 --> 33:40.363
Dad, are you and Uncle Billy really
gonna open a miniature golf course?

33:40.488 --> 33:43.032
Nah. We'll just build it
when someone pays for it.

33:43.158 --> 33:46.661
- What's miniature golf?
- For midget brains, like you.

33:46.786 --> 33:48.830
- I was only asking.
- You shut up!

33:57.797 --> 34:00.341
You're gonna make that turtle sick again.

34:01.634 --> 34:03.803
You gotta breathe on it.

34:05.847 --> 34:07.891
Look at me, Dad!

34:11.143 --> 34:13.438
Nothing's happening.

34:14.397 --> 34:17.275
Well, pumpkin, you gotta light the burner.

34:22.362 --> 34:23.531
30 seconds.

34:23.656 --> 34:27.076
29... 28... 27...

34:31.246 --> 34:33.291
Fire, fire!

34:34.375 --> 34:36.210
Hey, come here. Sit down.

34:37.295 --> 34:40.005
- Let me see your hand.
- I smell hair!

34:40.130 --> 34:42.842
I'll get the burn ointment.
You'll be all right.

34:42.967 --> 34:45.011
Ouch!

34:55.980 --> 34:58.233
OK, let's see, we...

34:58.358 --> 35:00.568
Way to hustle, guys!

35:00.693 --> 35:02.737
You all right?

35:03.530 --> 35:05.573
Well, now we know they work.

35:06.658 --> 35:10.286
- Pretty good eats!
- Should mashed potatoes be crunchy?

35:11.287 --> 35:12.747
Where are you going?

35:14.374 --> 35:17.627
Out! I go out every night after dinner.

35:17.752 --> 35:21.214
Meet the boys at the bowling alley
for a couple of beers.

35:21.339 --> 35:25.343
- Don't leave me alone with them!
- Come on, honey. That's not fair.

35:25.468 --> 35:28.680
You know we live like this.
Never bothered you before.

35:28.805 --> 35:31.808
It's just the way it is.
You'd better get used to it.

35:32.767 --> 35:35.019
When are you coming home?

35:35.603 --> 35:39.274
When I feel like it.
It just depends on how drunk I get.

35:56.458 --> 35:58.376
How's it goin' with your debutante?

35:58.501 --> 36:01.796
She's one lousy cook!
But as long as I don't have to do it.

36:01.921 --> 36:06.342
- How long are you gonna keep her?
- Let's see. 25 bucks a day, huh?

36:06.968 --> 36:12.223
Figure little wifey-poo can work off what
she owes me in... a little over a month.

36:12.348 --> 36:15.351
- Your first night with her, huh?
- Mm-hm.

36:15.477 --> 36:16.811
Uh-huh! Come on, huh!

36:18.855 --> 36:21.900
I'm not gonna tell you
she doesn't have a great body.

36:22.025 --> 36:25.069
And a pretty decent face...
Ah, she's too rich for my blood!

36:25.195 --> 36:28.990
Chocolate cake's a bit rich too,
but I'd like to eat one once in a while.

36:29.115 --> 36:32.035
Not my style.
Course, eating a whole cake isn't, either.

36:32.160 --> 36:34.496
But I'm gonna have some fun
with her tonight!

36:34.621 --> 36:37.082
- What are you gonna do?
- What are you drinkin'?

36:37.207 --> 36:39.375
Some rotgut. Cheapest stuff they got.

36:39.501 --> 36:41.336
Perfect.

36:43.922 --> 36:44.923
Wait!

36:45.048 --> 36:48.426
You jumped my bones
the first night we met!

36:48.551 --> 36:53.098
- We did it on the first date?
- Well, I couldn't call it a date, really.

36:53.223 --> 36:56.559
We just did it right there
in the parking lot of the 7-Eleven.

36:58.269 --> 37:00.146
- I'm a slut.
- Huh?

37:00.271 --> 37:01.689
Nothing.

37:02.357 --> 37:04.400
- Ooh!
- Oh!

37:04.943 --> 37:08.113
Hey, I'm a little drunk tonight,
baby, so, you know,

37:08.238 --> 37:10.907
it might take me a while to get there.

37:11.032 --> 37:14.285
Oh! What? No boom-boom?

37:15.537 --> 37:17.956
Well, hey, I understand.

37:18.081 --> 37:22.377
You probably just wanna go right
to sleep and skip the fun stuff, huh?

37:22.502 --> 37:24.087
- Yes.
- OK.

37:24.212 --> 37:26.589
Thank you. No boom-boom.

37:29.300 --> 37:31.219
- Baby.
- Hm?

37:31.344 --> 37:34.347
- The couch.
- What?

37:34.472 --> 37:38.768
You see, honey, you've got a bad back
because the bed's too soft for you.

37:38.893 --> 37:42.105
That's why you always sleep
on the living-room couch.

37:56.911 --> 38:00.874
I'm a short... fat... slut.

38:14.846 --> 38:17.307
Get off of my body!

38:17.849 --> 38:19.476
Rover!

39:48.773 --> 39:52.026
- Up, up, up, up, up! Come on!
- Help! Help!

39:52.152 --> 39:56.573
Time to get up. Gotta fix the kids' lunches
or they'll miss the bus for school.

39:56.698 --> 39:59.451
I don't care if they don't go to school.

40:02.078 --> 40:04.122
OK. They'll just be with you all day.

40:06.082 --> 40:07.584
Bye, Mom!

40:07.709 --> 40:11.337
Whoa, whoa, the bus is here!
7.15, let's go!

40:11.463 --> 40:13.214
Hurry up, Mom!

40:22.849 --> 40:26.144
Roy. Roy!

40:26.269 --> 40:29.272
My name is Travis.

40:30.940 --> 40:32.817
Travis.

40:33.735 --> 40:35.653
Travis!

40:38.698 --> 40:39.991
Come on, Joey.

40:40.116 --> 40:41.618
Stop honking!

40:47.373 --> 40:49.250
Twin! Oh, twin!

40:49.375 --> 40:52.087
She means you.
Have a good day at school, honey.

40:53.379 --> 40:56.132
You ready? You ready?
Come on, come on!

40:56.257 --> 40:58.551
Bye, Mom. You're doin' a great job.

40:58.676 --> 41:01.137
I'm off to work.

41:01.262 --> 41:04.224
Somebody's gotta keep this family
in the lap of luxury.

41:06.392 --> 41:09.395
I figured you'd forget,
so I made it for you myself.

41:09.521 --> 41:12.482
- What?
- Your list of daily chores.

41:12.607 --> 41:14.651
See ya tonight.

41:15.193 --> 41:17.612
- Dean?
- D Zippety doo dah!

41:17.737 --> 41:19.114
D Zippety yay!

41:19.239 --> 41:22.242
D My oh my, I got a wonderful slave

41:22.367 --> 41:24.411
And you are a genius!

41:37.507 --> 41:42.637
You're living in a nightmare
that starts at the crack of dawn.

41:46.057 --> 41:48.309
Down! Down!

41:53.148 --> 41:55.483
<i>~ Jim Dandy to the rescue ~</i>

41:55.984 --> 41:58.486
<i>~ Jim Dandy to the rescue ~</i>

41:58.945 --> 42:00.989
<i>~ Jim Dandy to the rescue ~</i>

42:01.406 --> 42:04.033
<i>~ Go, Jim Dandy! Go, Jim Dandy! ~</i>

42:18.882 --> 42:22.135
<i>~ Go, Jim Dandy! Go, Jim Dandy! ~</i>

42:24.763 --> 42:27.474
Dinner! Dinner!

43:43.383 --> 43:45.301
She needs food.

43:47.512 --> 43:49.556
This is fun.

43:53.560 --> 43:54.769
Hey, guys.

43:57.689 --> 44:00.900
- What's goin' on here?
- Nothing. We're OK. We're fine.

44:01.025 --> 44:03.987
- How about you?
- Oh, no. What's wrong with her?

44:04.487 --> 44:06.781
She's been like that for an hour now.

44:07.949 --> 44:10.076
- She's getting better, though.
- Better?

44:10.201 --> 44:12.245
Yeah, she's not going "Ba-ba-ba..."

44:12.370 --> 44:15.582
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba...

44:15.707 --> 44:18.376
- Why did she do that?
- She destroyed the scarecrow.

44:18.501 --> 44:20.336
She ripped the sucker's head off!

44:20.462 --> 44:26.384
I like when she goes
"Ba-ba-ba-ba ba-ba-ba."

44:26.509 --> 44:28.219
Hey! Baby doll!

44:29.721 --> 44:32.098
What's for dinner?

44:32.223 --> 44:36.519
Bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu ba-ba-ha-ha...

44:36.644 --> 44:39.647
OK! I'll take it from here.
Go on, get upstairs!

44:42.150 --> 44:45.403
- Will you trade her in for a new one?
- Nah, she'll be all right.

44:45.945 --> 44:47.989
Come on, guys! Move it!

44:55.330 --> 44:57.373
Feel better?

44:57.499 --> 45:02.670
I don't belong here. I feel it.
Don't you think I feel it?

45:03.338 --> 45:07.258
I can't do any of these vile things
and I wouldn't want to!

45:09.010 --> 45:11.137
My life is like death!

45:11.262 --> 45:15.391
My children are the spawn of hell
and you're the devil.

45:15.517 --> 45:17.560
Oh, God...

45:23.149 --> 45:26.111
Baby, we <i>like</i> you.

45:28.238 --> 45:30.782
She's OK. She's doin' the dishes.

45:30.907 --> 45:34.160
- No more "ba-ba-ba-ba-ba".
- Good. All right.

45:34.285 --> 45:35.453
- Dad?
- Yeah?

45:35.578 --> 45:39.290
- Will she figure out we're tricking her?
- Not if we don't blow it.

45:42.794 --> 45:45.880
- What are you doin'?
- Looking for memorabilia.

45:46.673 --> 45:48.716
Memora-what?

45:49.384 --> 45:51.594
Scrapbooks. Photographs.

45:52.387 --> 45:55.974
Something that will spark
some wisp of a memory.

45:56.099 --> 45:58.560
Do we or do we not possess these things?

45:59.894 --> 46:01.688
Uh, well...

46:01.813 --> 46:05.108
Do you mean to tell me
there is no photographic evidence

46:05.233 --> 46:09.070
of our life together...
anywhere in existence?

46:09.195 --> 46:12.574
Well, I don't know
where they'd be because, uh...

46:12.699 --> 46:15.368
you know,
we lost a lot of stuff in the move.

46:15.493 --> 46:18.204
And it's possible that, uh...

46:18.329 --> 46:20.707
we lost...

46:37.307 --> 46:39.517
The closet

46:40.894 --> 46:42.729
and you.

46:43.605 --> 46:49.110
That's right. This is me...
and I'm standing in front of the closet.

46:50.028 --> 46:52.113
Something's familiar.

46:53.031 --> 46:56.993
You got it. We used to do it in the closet.

46:57.118 --> 46:59.037
Oh, stop with the sex stories!

46:59.162 --> 47:01.623
You're grumpy
because you've been busy.

47:01.748 --> 47:05.251
I want you to stop everything,
go on in here, take a bath...

47:05.376 --> 47:08.046
Hey, guys!
Get the turtle out of the bathtub!

47:08.171 --> 47:11.174
I'll look for the pictures
first thing in the morning, OK?

47:11.299 --> 47:13.343
All right. Good night, honey.

47:48.378 --> 47:51.089
- Somebody better be dead!
- Billy!

47:51.214 --> 47:53.174
Billy, I want you to do me a favour.

47:53.299 --> 47:55.427
- Who you talkin' to?
- Nobody.

47:55.552 --> 47:56.886
- Who's that?
- No one.

47:57.011 --> 47:58.471
Hey, is that Dean?

47:58.596 --> 48:01.307
- Hi, Dean. Come on in.
- Go back to bed, Gertie.

48:01.433 --> 48:05.770
- If you treat me like that, I'm goin' home.
- Come on, Gertie, don't be like that!

48:05.895 --> 48:09.107
Remember in high school you faked
our IDs? I need a fake bride.

48:09.232 --> 48:12.944
- Come on, Dean. I'm busy!
- Not any more. She's goin' home.

48:13.611 --> 48:15.697
OK, but if we get caught, it's your ass!

48:17.866 --> 48:20.702
It's my wedding day.
Why do I look so annoyed?

48:20.827 --> 48:23.204
Oh, yeah. Your dad showed up shit-faced.

48:23.329 --> 48:26.624
He threw potato salad all over my mom.
We had to throw him out!

48:26.750 --> 48:29.544
Why do I always have
this depressed look on my face?

48:29.669 --> 48:33.506
You were grumpy a lot. You were losing
the weight, then you gained it back.

48:33.631 --> 48:37.302
- Thin, fat, thin, fat.
- Was I <i>always</i> this miserable?

48:37.427 --> 48:40.555
- Wasn't I ever happy?
- Well, sure, honey. Lots.

48:40.680 --> 48:43.475
You were the happiest
little wife and mother around!

48:43.600 --> 48:47.437
Look at this. Before you lost the weight.
Can you believe it?

48:49.606 --> 48:52.442
All right. Now, that's it. Are you satisfied?

48:53.443 --> 48:55.487
- Yes.
- Good.

48:56.863 --> 48:59.741
I suppose I belong here in this... hovel.

49:01.326 --> 49:03.369
Come on, Jackson!

49:04.287 --> 49:06.331
Well, this is my life.

49:06.956 --> 49:09.000
I didn't marry very well, did I?

49:14.297 --> 49:16.341
<i>~ Your body ~</i>

49:16.466 --> 49:20.345
I love LA. I love all my starlets!

49:20.470 --> 49:23.014
- What were your names again?
- Tofutti Klein.

49:23.139 --> 49:25.100
Tofutti! I love it!

49:25.225 --> 49:27.477
If that's my mother-in-law,
I'm not here.

49:27.602 --> 49:30.249
You're Kim and Kimberly...

49:30.563 --> 49:33.399
- The Stayton yacht.
- <i>Hello, Andrew. It's Mrs Mintz</i>.

49:33.525 --> 49:35.527
I'm so virile, I'm so rich!

49:35.652 --> 49:37.737
<i>I'd like to speak to my daughter</i>.

49:37.862 --> 49:40.407
<i>They're not here, madam</i>.
<i>They've gone shopping</i>.

49:45.912 --> 49:48.456
Uh, a little bit lower.

49:48.581 --> 49:51.167
Yeah. Yeah, lower.

49:52.919 --> 49:54.963
That's good. That's good.

49:56.589 --> 50:00.635
- Were you really in the Coast Guard?
- Damn right.

50:00.760 --> 50:02.846
Why does he keep staring at me?

50:02.971 --> 50:04.806
- Is he?
- Yes! He was staring at me

50:04.931 --> 50:07.142
with his mouth open all through dinner.

50:07.267 --> 50:11.187
Well, honey,
Billy was your high-school boyfriend.

50:12.981 --> 50:16.693
You don't get any of the old feelings back
when you look at him, do you?

50:25.869 --> 50:27.746
I don't wanna do it!

50:27.871 --> 50:31.791
You gotta do it
if you wanna be a gruesome ghoul!

50:31.916 --> 50:34.711
It's part of the initiation! Think about it.

50:34.836 --> 50:37.922
That's good. Thanks a lot. Ah, yeah.

50:39.424 --> 50:42.802
Uh, sugarlips.
I think our guest needs another beer.

50:43.386 --> 50:46.723
Uh, well, I really shouldn't,
but maybe, uh... just one more

50:47.140 --> 50:48.558
six-pack!

50:54.314 --> 50:56.274
- Attagirl!
- Thank you.

50:56.399 --> 50:58.026
That's all the beer.

50:58.151 --> 51:00.653
Whoa, buttercup!
Just about time for dessert!

51:00.779 --> 51:03.364
- How about some brownies?
- I didn't make any.

51:03.490 --> 51:06.409
- How about chocolate cream pie?
- I made that.

51:06.534 --> 51:10.330
- Is this gonna work?
- My ideas always work. I'm gifted.

51:10.455 --> 51:13.750
I loved it when you glued Joey
to the toilet seat.

51:16.086 --> 51:19.923
I was thinking about it at work.
We need a theme for the golf course.

51:20.256 --> 51:24.803
We can use a few contraptions
you can knock some golf balls through.

51:25.011 --> 51:28.264
- What's the score? I had my eyes closed.
- 32-10.

51:28.389 --> 51:31.228
- Who's winning?
- The guys with 32.

51:43.405 --> 51:45.365
- Great!
- Who did this?!

51:48.034 --> 51:49.702
Travis!

51:49.828 --> 51:52.122
Hey, honey, what happened?

51:52.247 --> 51:55.333
Oooh! <i>This</i> happened.

51:57.794 --> 52:01.798
- You guys are beggin' for it!
- Stop blustering! You won't punish them!

52:01.923 --> 52:04.551
Ease up there, love chop! Just ease up.

52:04.676 --> 52:07.178
Ease up? Ease up?

52:08.054 --> 52:11.307
Since I walked through that door,
I have cooked, cleaned,

52:11.433 --> 52:13.309
scrubbed, chopped wood.

52:13.435 --> 52:17.272
I've waited on you, your dogs,
your kids and your friends

52:17.397 --> 52:20.733
in the hopes that I would
remember some shred of my life

52:20.859 --> 52:24.279
and now it is entirely clear to me
why I've chosen to block it out!

52:24.404 --> 52:27.282
- Now, none of this ever...
- Bothered me before.

52:27.407 --> 52:29.075
Well, it bothers me now.

52:31.578 --> 52:34.247
- All right, Joe!
- Is that so?

52:35.206 --> 52:39.210
Hey, hey, Joe! Come on, guys!
No more jokes on Mom today, huh?

52:39.335 --> 52:41.463
You really got her where you want her.

52:41.588 --> 52:44.507
I got everything under control,
don't worry.

52:44.632 --> 52:47.761
- This is flat. Give me another one, Billy.
- I only got six.

52:47.886 --> 52:51.598
We're just gonna have to send out
the old ball and chain to buy some more.

52:58.938 --> 53:00.899
Good stuff!

53:01.024 --> 53:03.067
Your chocolate cream pie.

53:11.326 --> 53:12.952
Thanks, honey.

53:13.078 --> 53:17.165
I guess it's kinda tough to serve
with your hands stuck to plates.

53:20.919 --> 53:22.670
Honey, we need forks!

53:24.005 --> 53:26.132
- Sugarlips!
- Yeah?

53:30.470 --> 53:32.222
Wait a minute!

53:36.476 --> 53:38.520
Fire, fire, fire!

53:43.608 --> 53:46.027
- Yeah!
- OK, guys, go get her!

53:51.366 --> 53:53.410
Hey, thanks for a lovely dinner.

53:53.535 --> 53:56.579
- She never did that before.
- She did it now!

53:56.704 --> 53:59.582
- Look at this! I gotta go to work!
- Wait for me!

54:00.250 --> 54:02.419
She went this way, guys!

54:02.544 --> 54:05.004
Gruesome ghouls, attack!

54:05.130 --> 54:07.841
- What should I do, Travis?
- Go home!

54:13.054 --> 54:14.472
I got you!

54:18.560 --> 54:21.479
- Tickle her!
- She's ticklish!

54:22.105 --> 54:24.149
Ow, that hurts! Ow!

54:25.984 --> 54:27.986
Leave me alone!

54:29.738 --> 54:31.781
All right, time to get up.

54:32.907 --> 54:35.869
Go to the bathroom
and do what you normally do.

54:35.994 --> 54:38.955
- You gonna squirt us with a hose again?
- That's up to you.

54:39.080 --> 54:43.209
- I gotta feed my turtle.
- The damn turtle stole my headband.

54:43.334 --> 54:45.378
Joey, come on. Time to get up!

54:45.503 --> 54:49.299
I don't want to! The teacher's a big fat tub!

54:49.966 --> 54:52.093
Proffitt boys, come up here!

54:55.930 --> 54:59.017
Miss Pitcannon tells me
you don't wanna take these tests.

54:59.142 --> 55:01.644
I'm itchin' and I wanna go home!

55:01.770 --> 55:05.940
You may go stand in the corner
until you can talk like a little boy!

55:07.192 --> 55:09.944
All of you children
are new in this school.

55:10.070 --> 55:13.656
These scores will determine
your placement in future classes.

55:13.782 --> 55:17.744
- You must concentrate... Greg! Stop that!
- Make a face.

55:17.869 --> 55:19.996
- I'm in real bad shape!
- Nonsense!

55:20.121 --> 55:24.667
Now, if you concentrate, I'm sure
you can control those little bodies.

55:25.627 --> 55:27.629
I see that, Amanda.

55:27.754 --> 55:29.798
Joey, sit!

55:30.799 --> 55:34.385
- Is anyone at your home?
- Yeah. Our mom is.

55:34.511 --> 55:37.889
You have a mother now?
Your father remarried?

55:39.057 --> 55:41.976
Um, yeah. We got a new mother now.

55:42.102 --> 55:45.688
Well, good.
Then I'm calling <i>both</i> your parents!

55:51.277 --> 55:54.823
Mrs Burbridge, I'm Annie Proffitt.
What happened?

55:54.948 --> 55:59.452
Well, Mrs Proffitt, apparently
your children consider themselves

55:59.577 --> 56:02.288
above taking
the Schwartzman-Heinliken tests.

56:02.414 --> 56:05.291
I'm sorry. What are
the Schwartzman-Heinliken tests?

56:05.417 --> 56:10.839
Placement tests. They are very valuable
in measuring intelligence and potential.

56:10.964 --> 56:12.215
Sit still!

56:12.340 --> 56:15.260
Your children are a discipline problem.

56:15.385 --> 56:18.763
I know. I have had difficulties myself.

56:19.305 --> 56:22.642
- What did you do now?
- Oh! They decided to play sick!

56:22.767 --> 56:25.228
And not very convincingly.

56:25.353 --> 56:30.191
Now, I believe their problems exist
because of deficient parental guidance.

56:30.316 --> 56:33.027
The children are slovenly, incorrigible

56:33.153 --> 56:37.949
and being reared by a father who clearly
isn't concerned about their welfare,

56:38.074 --> 56:41.035
but is himself just a large child!

56:41.161 --> 56:44.998
- Excuse me, Mrs Burbridge.
- Oh, the test results. Thank you.

56:45.123 --> 56:48.960
I'll look these over as soon as
I'm finished with this... <i>woman</i>.

56:49.085 --> 56:51.087
Oh, my God.

56:55.675 --> 56:58.470
I'll see you later in the cafeteria.

57:00.472 --> 57:03.850
Mrs Burbridge,
would you come over here for a moment?

57:05.059 --> 57:09.522
Has it escaped your attention that these
children have head-to-toe poison oak?

57:09.647 --> 57:12.108
Well, no... Yes, but...

57:12.233 --> 57:15.987
But what? My children are
in need of medical assistance!

57:16.112 --> 57:20.158
And you can sit here and smugly
lecture me on the importance of tests?

57:20.283 --> 57:24.829
Tests which label children's potential -
a thing which <i>cannot</i> be measured!

57:24.954 --> 57:27.874
Least of all by anal-compulsive Huns!

57:29.250 --> 57:33.755
And my husband may be a large child,
but that's none of your business.

57:33.880 --> 57:36.466
And my children may be rotten,
but they're mine!

57:36.591 --> 57:39.177
And I think that they're bright
and sensitive.

57:39.302 --> 57:42.514
So I have no doubts whatsoever
about their intelligence!

57:42.639 --> 57:45.725
I do, however,
have serious doubts about yours!

57:46.935 --> 57:49.020
Kids, get in the car. Let's go.

57:49.395 --> 57:50.396
Move!

57:53.316 --> 57:56.152
- She told her off.
- Dad never did that.

57:57.821 --> 57:59.572
Discipline problem?

58:00.281 --> 58:03.118
My regards to
Schwartzman and Heinliken.

58:04.494 --> 58:07.080
I can't stop itching!

58:07.205 --> 58:11.334
Well, what do you expect
when you roll around in poison oak?

58:12.752 --> 58:17.173
What I want you to do, what the doctor
said, is put it right on the red parts.

58:17.298 --> 58:18.425
OK?

58:18.550 --> 58:22.178
Soon we're going to clean up
this room because it's a disgrace.

58:22.303 --> 58:25.974
- We like it like a disgrace.
- Dad lets us do whatever we want!

58:26.099 --> 58:28.560
Yeah, well, it's trickling
down the stairway.

58:28.685 --> 58:32.814
Joey, don't. Don't get that near your eyes.
Look, I want you to read this.

58:32.939 --> 58:36.317
See what it says?
"Don't get near your eyes." Read on.

58:43.408 --> 58:47.245
- What's this all about?
- He's embarrassed cos he can't read.

58:47.370 --> 58:50.749
- Well, he's a small child.
- He can't read for a small child either.

58:50.874 --> 58:53.793
The teacher makes fun of him!

58:55.754 --> 58:58.089
OK, we'll talk about this later.
Go to sleep.

58:58.381 --> 59:00.383
- Dean!
- Where is that?

59:00.508 --> 59:01.968
- Dean!
- Yeah!

59:02.093 --> 59:04.095
- What is it?
- Where are you going?

59:04.220 --> 59:07.015
Out. If I could ever find my...

59:07.515 --> 59:09.601
Oh, wait. Wait!

59:09.726 --> 59:11.770
Not tonight! We have to talk.

59:13.104 --> 59:15.899
- When I get home. I'm in a hurry.
- Now!

59:17.150 --> 59:21.780
You know, I let the water routine slide by
the other day, but let's not push it, OK?

59:21.905 --> 59:25.241
I got a little carried away with the hose,
but this is important.

59:25.366 --> 59:27.911
OK, fine. What's on your mind, sugarlips?

59:28.036 --> 59:31.414
Stop calling me sugarlips!
I have a name. Call me Annie.

59:31.539 --> 59:34.876
Get to the point, <i>Annie</i>. I'm busy.
The guys are waitin' for me.

59:35.001 --> 59:39.339
You can't run out every time things get
complicated here. The kids are sick!

59:39.464 --> 59:42.133
They got calamine lotion.
What do you want me to do?

59:42.258 --> 59:47.222
- Take on some grown-up responsibility!
- I earn the money. That's a responsibility.

59:47.764 --> 59:52.018
Are you aware that Joey can't read?
That Travis only reads smut magazines?

59:52.143 --> 59:56.648
- I can't get him out of the bathroom.
- He's 13! I'll build you another bathroom!

59:56.773 --> 59:59.734
They don't need that!
They need guidance from you!

59:59.859 --> 01:00:05.031
Oh-oh-oh! Now, don't you worry
about me and my boys, OK? We're pals.

01:00:05.490 --> 01:00:07.659
They have enough pals.
They need a father.

01:00:07.784 --> 01:00:11.663
Hey, hey, hey, look. I decided
a long time before you... you and me...

01:00:11.788 --> 01:00:15.208
<i>We</i> decided a long time ago,
before we started this family,

01:00:15.333 --> 01:00:18.753
we'd raise these kids naturally,
not force bullshit rules...

01:00:18.878 --> 01:00:21.548
I'm not talking about discipline.
I'm talking...

01:00:21.673 --> 01:00:26.553
Stuff you shouldn't be talking about!
It's none of your business, anyway.

01:00:26.678 --> 01:00:30.682
- My children are none of my business?
- Look... I have... Now I'm late!

01:00:30.807 --> 01:00:32.851
Thanks a lot! Appreciate it.

01:01:17.812 --> 01:01:20.440
Say, Annie. Are you asleep?

01:01:20.565 --> 01:01:22.984
No. Go away.

01:01:23.109 --> 01:01:24.903
Uh... listen. I'm...

01:01:25.695 --> 01:01:28.364
I'm sorry I came down on you
so hard before.

01:01:29.699 --> 01:01:31.826
It's OK.

01:01:31.951 --> 01:01:36.623
Just so you won't think I don't appreciate
all the work you're doin' in the house

01:01:36.748 --> 01:01:39.834
and how you handle the kids
and all that, uh...

01:01:41.294 --> 01:01:43.338
You know, I think you're doin' great.

01:01:44.214 --> 01:01:48.259
I mean, what you said about me
and the boys tonight, uh...

01:01:49.177 --> 01:01:51.221
I guess you probably...

01:01:52.055 --> 01:01:56.392
You know, maybe you got a small point
there, and I just... I can't...

01:01:57.268 --> 01:01:59.729
I can't talk to you
while you're turned away.

01:01:59.854 --> 01:02:02.774
- Will you just please get your head out?
- No.

01:02:02.899 --> 01:02:04.943
- No!
- Why?

01:02:07.237 --> 01:02:09.280
Because I'm so ugly.

01:02:10.240 --> 01:02:12.659
I got poison oak, too!

01:02:13.451 --> 01:02:16.579
Come on, now.
Nobody cares what you look like.

01:02:16.704 --> 01:02:21.000
I mean, we do like the way you look.
Normally you look real pretty.

01:02:21.126 --> 01:02:23.837
You just don't now.

01:02:24.546 --> 01:02:26.589
All right, forget it.

01:02:27.382 --> 01:02:30.635
I don't even have a wedding ring!

01:02:30.760 --> 01:02:35.723
- What?
- I lost my wedding ring in the sea.

01:02:37.016 --> 01:02:39.978
OK, come on. Come on.

01:02:40.103 --> 01:02:42.814
Let's go.

01:02:42.939 --> 01:02:46.818
Oh, no.
I'm not going back in the water barrel!

01:02:47.944 --> 01:02:51.197
I'm puttin' you in the bedroom.
I'll take the couch.

01:02:51.740 --> 01:02:54.451
Oh, hey, listen.
I've had poison oak a million times.

01:02:54.576 --> 01:02:56.786
Come on, guys. Up! Up!

01:02:57.287 --> 01:03:01.499
Yeah. You know,
I once got poison oak on my bu... back.

01:03:02.250 --> 01:03:03.710
And, uh...

01:03:03.835 --> 01:03:07.839
Well, don't you worry.
It'll be gone in no time. Lift your head.

01:03:07.964 --> 01:03:10.925
- That's it. Is that better?
- Yeah.

01:03:11.050 --> 01:03:13.094
- All right?
- Yes.

01:03:14.345 --> 01:03:18.266
Tell me something about my life,
about my past. Please.

01:03:19.267 --> 01:03:21.311
Something not horrible.

01:03:22.437 --> 01:03:24.481
Uh, OK.

01:03:28.026 --> 01:03:32.447
Yeah. Well, there was that time, uh...

01:03:32.572 --> 01:03:34.157
...when you were, uh...

01:03:34.282 --> 01:03:36.534
You were working at...

01:03:36.659 --> 01:03:39.245
yeah, Burger Boy over in Lewisville.

01:03:39.788 --> 01:03:43.666
And, uh, this kid started
choking on a French fry.

01:03:43.792 --> 01:03:47.295
Everybody there panicked,
including me, except for you.

01:03:47.420 --> 01:03:53.093
You ran over to him and you gave him
that Heimlich manoeuvre, where you...

01:03:53.885 --> 01:03:56.513
And poof! The kid puked up the fry

01:03:56.638 --> 01:03:59.474
and they named you
Burger Boy employee of the month.

01:03:59.599 --> 01:04:03.895
It was great. They put your picture
above the cash register and...

01:04:04.020 --> 01:04:06.773
I was really proud of you. I mean it.

01:04:10.110 --> 01:04:12.862
You can be quite charming
when you wanna be.

01:04:13.947 --> 01:04:16.866
Ah. You just caught me on a bad day.

01:04:19.953 --> 01:04:22.163
Good night... Annie.

01:04:23.748 --> 01:04:25.792
Good night.

01:04:32.841 --> 01:04:36.127
- Heads up!
- After I finished with the Coast Guard,

01:04:36.227 --> 01:04:39.097
I looked up Dean.
We used to play football together.

01:04:39.222 --> 01:04:42.934
Used to call him Mean Dean Proffitt.
Used to call me Bad Billy Pratt.

01:04:43.059 --> 01:04:45.520
- Out!
- Now, Billy, when did we date?

01:04:48.314 --> 01:04:50.358
Let's eat!

01:04:51.359 --> 01:04:54.237
- It might be...
- Are we talking about the golf course?

01:04:54.362 --> 01:04:57.240
Yeah. The guys with suits
come down in less than a week.

01:04:57.365 --> 01:04:59.159
What do you think about this, huh?

01:04:59.284 --> 01:05:02.579
Sink 'Em and Drink 'Em.
18 holes based on famous breweries.

01:05:02.704 --> 01:05:05.415
I think what I thought yesterday.
It's a lousy idea.

01:05:05.540 --> 01:05:08.168
I thought you'd change your mind
now you're sober.

01:05:08.293 --> 01:05:11.379
What about other places? Foreign places.

01:05:11.504 --> 01:05:13.548
What do you mean?
Like France or Africa?

01:05:13.673 --> 01:05:16.092
<i>Mais oui!</i>
<i>La Tour Eiffel, comme c'est jolie!</i>

01:05:16.217 --> 01:05:18.845
I speak French!

01:05:19.679 --> 01:05:22.015
It just came out.

01:05:22.140 --> 01:05:24.350
Do I know what I said?

01:05:24.476 --> 01:05:26.269
Yes, I do.

01:05:26.394 --> 01:05:28.521
I must have learned that in Paris.

01:05:29.606 --> 01:05:31.649
When was I in Paris?

01:05:32.525 --> 01:05:34.611
In the Navy.

01:05:34.736 --> 01:05:37.822
- Navy.
- Well, it's a stupid idea in any language.

01:05:37.947 --> 01:05:40.617
Besides, we're building
these things in America.

01:05:41.117 --> 01:05:43.203
Wait a minute. This isn't a bad idea.

01:05:43.328 --> 01:05:45.872
I could invent some wild things here.
Go on.

01:05:45.997 --> 01:05:49.667
Well, like, uh... the Taj Mahal,
Seven Wonders of the World.

01:05:49.793 --> 01:05:54.089
- Bring them to the people of Elk Cove!
- Well, I gotta bring it in for a price.

01:05:54.214 --> 01:05:57.008
I can bring it in,
but can you draw me some pictures

01:05:57.133 --> 01:05:59.761
so I can see what you mean? Annie?

01:06:04.557 --> 01:06:06.810
- What's this?
- Travis found a girlfriend.

01:06:06.935 --> 01:06:09.979
Hey, Trav! Don't knock her up!

01:06:10.980 --> 01:06:14.776
- Very funny! Watch your...
- Oh, Mom!

01:06:14.901 --> 01:06:17.112
Yeah, "Oh, Mom!" Watch your language!

01:06:17.237 --> 01:06:19.572
Come on! What are you talkin' about?

01:06:19.697 --> 01:06:22.784
- Pick a wonder.
- Stevie Wonder.

01:06:23.910 --> 01:06:26.913
- Give me a wonder. One wonder.
- There's Mount Rushmore.

01:06:27.038 --> 01:06:29.082
- The Parthenon.
- Parthenon, right.

01:06:29.207 --> 01:06:33.461
- St Basil's, the Russian cathedral.
- Grand Canyon. Everybody'll love that!

01:06:33.586 --> 01:06:35.964
- Egyptian pyramids.
- The Eiffel Tower.

01:06:36.089 --> 01:06:41.177
It's expensive. I gotta build...
If it rains... Hey, fibreglass! Perfect!

01:06:44.514 --> 01:06:47.976
Let's clean up for an early dinner.
I've got a lot of drawing to do.

01:06:48.101 --> 01:06:50.145
Isn't Dad gonna eat with us tonight?

01:06:50.270 --> 01:06:52.564
No! He had to go out.

01:06:53.690 --> 01:06:56.109
- He had to go bowling this time.
- Really?

01:06:56.234 --> 01:06:59.195
It's pretty hard to go bowling
without a bowling ball.

01:07:15.003 --> 01:07:18.339
D I know I done you wrong

01:07:18.465 --> 01:07:21.509
d Do you remember
that rainy evening I put you out

01:07:21.634 --> 01:07:23.154
d With nothin' but a fine-toothed comb

01:07:23.261 --> 01:07:25.430
What would you want
with old sweet-mouth?

01:07:25.555 --> 01:07:28.057
D Ain't that a shame, I know I'm to blame

01:07:28.183 --> 01:07:31.686
d Bill Bailey,
won't you please come home?

01:07:35.982 --> 01:07:39.819
<i>Scott Murphy,</i>
<i>bring your invoice up to the front</i>.

01:07:39.944 --> 01:07:43.490
This ain't your average
pile of fertiliser here.

01:07:43.615 --> 01:07:48.244
Uh-uh. No, siree.
This here's a special blend.

01:07:48.369 --> 01:07:53.374
Fish heads, shrimp skins,
crab claws, earthworm droppings...

01:07:53.500 --> 01:07:55.794
I don't wanna know that much about it.

01:07:55.919 --> 01:07:59.005
- Here you go.
- After this, you get to shovel fish guts!

01:07:59.130 --> 01:08:01.633
If you're lucky,
we'll let you clean the truck!

01:08:02.133 --> 01:08:06.471
- Whoops! I forgot to give you this.
- What have I got to put on airs for?

01:08:06.596 --> 01:08:08.640
Oh, stop fussing. You look great.

01:08:08.765 --> 01:08:12.936
Well, they put their pants on
just like me - one leg at a time.

01:08:13.061 --> 01:08:15.188
Now, don't be nervous, OK?

01:08:15.313 --> 01:08:17.232
If you don't get it, so what?

01:08:17.357 --> 01:08:20.693
We've been through
rougher times than these before.

01:08:20.819 --> 01:08:22.862
I think.

01:08:28.410 --> 01:08:32.372
Gentlemen, this is Dean Proffitt,
inventor and master craftsman.

01:08:33.206 --> 01:08:35.375
What we're here for this evening is this.

01:08:35.500 --> 01:08:39.379
It's the Wonders of the World
miniature golf course.

01:08:39.504 --> 01:08:43.383
If you look at these pictures,
you can begin to sort of feel...

01:08:43.508 --> 01:08:47.511
What we're trying to do is bring some
of this outer world here into Elk Cove.

01:08:47.636 --> 01:08:50.807
The Leaning Tower of Pizza
doubles as a pizza stand.

01:08:50.932 --> 01:08:54.644
That sort of gives us an idea
of where we might go in the future.

01:08:55.979 --> 01:08:58.689
Oh, shit, I'm sorry. Here, let me get that.

01:08:58.814 --> 01:09:01.024
Waitress! Get over here, will you?

01:09:02.359 --> 01:09:04.863
Have you ever been nervous in your life?

01:09:11.870 --> 01:09:14.372
Go ahead, ask me.
Ask me if we got the money.

01:09:14.497 --> 01:09:16.124
Did you get the money?

01:09:16.249 --> 01:09:18.626
- We got the money!
- Oooh, great!

01:09:18.752 --> 01:09:21.254
- That's so great!
- Can you believe it?!

01:09:28.970 --> 01:09:32.974
Step up! She rolls up here... and down.

01:09:33.683 --> 01:09:37.812
It's got three choices. This time,
it's going through the oil funnel,

01:09:37.937 --> 01:09:42.067
past the plastic fan,
into the kids' sand shovel and flour sifter.

01:09:42.192 --> 01:09:46.779
Now, turn around quick. Here it comes.
It should be out about now.

01:09:46.904 --> 01:09:49.100
- OK, now show me your invention.
- You're gonna hate it.

01:09:49.200 --> 01:09:51.033
I'm not gonna hate it. I love 'em.

01:09:56.539 --> 01:09:57.957
That's nice.

01:10:04.005 --> 01:10:07.008
I gotta tell her, Billy.
I gotta tell Annie the truth.

01:10:07.133 --> 01:10:10.220
In the beginning, it was OK
because it was part of a gag.

01:10:10.345 --> 01:10:13.723
Now it's more like lies. I...
I know what you're thinkin'.

01:10:13.848 --> 01:10:17.477
- Hey, I'm not thinkin' anything.
- Yeah, you are and I'm gonna tell her.

01:10:17.602 --> 01:10:19.646
I know it's time to tell her!

01:10:23.400 --> 01:10:25.777
Ooh, Dr Death looks mad.

01:10:25.902 --> 01:10:29.572
- Joker's saying "No".
- I know. What does he say up here?

01:10:30.323 --> 01:10:33.076
"I will re... re... re..."

01:10:33.201 --> 01:10:38.081
- Reduce.
- "Reduce your puny planet to rub..."

01:10:38.790 --> 01:10:41.000
- Ru... ru...
- Rubble.

01:10:41.126 --> 01:10:43.837
Good! That's very good, sweetie.

01:10:44.921 --> 01:10:47.382
Are you gonna leave?

01:10:49.259 --> 01:10:51.219
No. I'm your mommy.

01:10:51.344 --> 01:10:54.472
- I'm not going anywhere.
- Sometimes moms leave.

01:10:55.181 --> 01:10:58.601
Well, I guess maybe they do.
But I'm not gonna go anywhere.

01:10:58.726 --> 01:11:00.770
Good.

01:11:02.272 --> 01:11:04.733
Oooh, what is this?
Is this a present for me?

01:11:04.858 --> 01:11:08.570
- Yes. I made it from macaroni.
- I love it.

01:11:09.070 --> 01:11:11.239
I'll always wear it.

01:11:12.741 --> 01:11:14.826
- Hey, Dad!
- Hi! How's it goin', guys?

01:11:14.951 --> 01:11:17.370
I got the part of Tiny Tim
in the school play.

01:11:17.495 --> 01:11:19.914
- I got an A in English.
- I'm flunkin' math.

01:11:20.832 --> 01:11:23.835
Well, I guess we better
work on it later on, huh?

01:11:23.960 --> 01:11:27.005
You're just in time.
Dr Death is on the rampage.

01:11:28.673 --> 01:11:30.592
Annie, I need to talk to you.

01:11:30.717 --> 01:11:32.761
Alone, guys.

01:11:36.723 --> 01:11:39.476
- Is something wrong?
- Uh, well...

01:11:39.601 --> 01:11:42.187
No. Uh, yeah. Yeah.

01:11:42.312 --> 01:11:46.024
No, I just... I need to tell you somethin'.
Here, sit down.

01:11:46.608 --> 01:11:48.651
What is it?

01:11:49.652 --> 01:11:53.239
Annie, I've done...
I've done something that, um...

01:11:53.364 --> 01:11:55.992
I'm ashamed of. And I just...

01:11:56.117 --> 01:11:59.162
- I already know.
- You do?

01:12:01.581 --> 01:12:06.127
- What... What do you know?
- You work nights at the fertiliser plant.

01:12:09.255 --> 01:12:12.967
You don't have to be ashamed
because you shovel fish guts.

01:12:14.010 --> 01:12:16.679
I'm proud of you no matter what you do.

01:12:16.805 --> 01:12:20.850
- Is that it?
- Uh, well, that's one of the things, but I...

01:12:20.975 --> 01:12:24.354
No. Not really.

01:12:25.021 --> 01:12:27.065
What is it?

01:12:32.612 --> 01:12:34.864
Annie...

01:12:39.327 --> 01:12:41.371
I...

01:12:42.163 --> 01:12:45.083
I... God, I forgot your birthday.

01:12:45.750 --> 01:12:48.753
- It's my birthday?
- Come on! Get dressed!

01:12:55.135 --> 01:12:57.387
D Jim Dandy to the rescue

01:12:58.221 --> 01:13:00.390
d Jim Dandy to the rescue

01:13:01.057 --> 01:13:03.435
d Jim Dandy to the rescue

01:13:03.560 --> 01:13:06.479
d Go, Jim Dandy! Go, Jim Dandy!

01:13:07.021 --> 01:13:09.524
D I'm sittin' on a mountain top

01:13:09.899 --> 01:13:12.652
d 30,000 feet to drop

01:13:12.777 --> 01:13:15.655
d Spied a lady on a runaway horse

01:13:15.780 --> 01:13:17.991
d Uh-huh, that's right, of course!

01:13:18.533 --> 01:13:20.785
D Jim Dandy to the rescue

01:13:20.910 --> 01:13:23.913
d Go, Jim Dandy! Go, Jim Dandy!

01:13:24.622 --> 01:13:28.251
- Come on, I've had it!
- What? Are we goin' home?

01:13:28.376 --> 01:13:30.128
- What?
- Are we going home?

01:13:30.253 --> 01:13:33.339
- Oh, no. I just... Aren't you hot?
- Yeah. Let's go outside.

01:13:33.465 --> 01:13:36.718
- Come on!
- Hey, let's not forget this. It's $7 a pop.

01:13:36.843 --> 01:13:40.680
Don't worry about what it costs.
It's your birthday! I got it covered.

01:13:43.183 --> 01:13:45.852
Just one last toast to your birthday.

01:13:46.728 --> 01:13:48.980
Oh! Whoops, I lost my bottom.

01:13:49.105 --> 01:13:50.690
Wait a minute.

01:13:51.066 --> 01:13:54.235
There! They always do that. Now, this is...

01:13:54.360 --> 01:13:56.529
- Happy birthday, Annie.
- Thanks, Dean.

01:13:59.157 --> 01:14:02.869
- I've never tasted anything quite like this.
- It's good stuff.

01:14:03.578 --> 01:14:05.997
Boy, it sure is pretty, isn't it?

01:14:07.540 --> 01:14:09.793
Why do they honk three times?

01:14:09.918 --> 01:14:11.961
To signal they're comin' home.

01:14:12.087 --> 01:14:17.258
Yeah, it's a legend... of Arturo,
who was a Portuguese fisherman.

01:14:17.383 --> 01:14:21.096
He met this beautiful girl
his first night in town - Catarina.

01:14:21.221 --> 01:14:24.057
And, um, eventually they fell in love.

01:14:24.182 --> 01:14:28.186
But the problem was that Catarina's
father was the territorial governor.

01:14:28.311 --> 01:14:31.606
He didn't want his only little girl
to be with a lowly fisherman.

01:14:31.731 --> 01:14:34.692
So he told Arturo
that he'd have to ship off,

01:14:34.818 --> 01:14:38.446
which he did, but he told Catarina
he'd be back for her

01:14:38.571 --> 01:14:42.492
and when he came back,
he'd signal with three long blasts

01:14:42.617 --> 01:14:47.080
so she could dive off the rocks and swim
to the boat, and they'd be on their way.

01:14:47.205 --> 01:14:49.082
Oh, I love this story.

01:14:49.207 --> 01:14:52.127
So, a year later,
everything went as planned.

01:14:52.252 --> 01:14:54.587
But when she was swimmin' out
to the boat,

01:14:54.712 --> 01:14:58.383
the fog got so thick that, uh,
she couldn't find the boat.

01:14:59.259 --> 01:15:02.971
Arturo panicked
and he called out "Catarina! Catarina!"

01:15:03.096 --> 01:15:05.056
Catarina yelled back "Arturo!"

01:15:05.181 --> 01:15:09.436
With that, he dove right off the boat
into the icy waters, and they...

01:15:09.561 --> 01:15:11.938
- Kissed.
- No, they drowned.

01:15:12.063 --> 01:15:14.566
They never found each other
and they drowned.

01:15:14.691 --> 01:15:18.445
- Oh, that's a terrible story!
- Yeah, but the legend is

01:15:18.570 --> 01:15:22.699
they reunited at the bottom of the sea,
right over there,

01:15:22.824 --> 01:15:27.287
and every time you see
the spray goin' up, it's them.

01:15:27.412 --> 01:15:30.707
- Making love?
- Yeah.

01:15:30.832 --> 01:15:32.876
For ever and ever.

01:15:41.634 --> 01:15:46.139
D For I can't help

01:15:46.848 --> 01:15:52.145
d Falling in love...

01:15:52.270 --> 01:15:54.314
Dean?

01:15:55.732 --> 01:15:57.776
What, Annie?

01:15:58.359 --> 01:16:00.403
How old am I?

01:16:05.784 --> 01:16:07.827
29.

01:17:10.265 --> 01:17:12.308
- Dean.
- Yeah?

01:17:13.268 --> 01:17:15.311
Was it always like this?

01:17:17.272 --> 01:17:19.941
Every time with you is like the first time.

01:17:45.383 --> 01:17:47.177
Oh, come on, guys!

01:17:47.302 --> 01:17:49.554
Hey, let us sleep for a while!

01:17:49.679 --> 01:17:51.723
Right, that's it! I'm gonna spank 'em.

01:17:51.848 --> 01:17:55.727
- No! Dean, please don't.
- Every one of them's gonna get it!

01:17:56.519 --> 01:17:57.937
Surprise!

01:17:58.063 --> 01:18:00.356
- A washing machine!
- Do you like it?

01:18:01.107 --> 01:18:03.443
Honey, it's so expensive.

01:18:03.568 --> 01:18:05.612
No shit!

01:18:07.906 --> 01:18:09.741
Thank you.

01:18:09.866 --> 01:18:13.161
She might have no tits
but she has a nice ass.

01:18:29.302 --> 01:18:31.137
Grant?

01:18:31.262 --> 01:18:33.098
Edith. Hello.

01:18:33.223 --> 01:18:37.185
This is ludicrous, Grant.
I have called every week for two months.

01:18:37.310 --> 01:18:39.312
<i>I've looked forward to each call</i>.

01:18:39.437 --> 01:18:42.607
Do you have the gall to tell me
that I've missed her again?

01:18:42.732 --> 01:18:45.360
- She's sleeping.
- <i>I don't believe you</i>.

01:18:45.485 --> 01:18:47.862
<i>Grant, if you do not produce Joanna</i>

01:18:47.987 --> 01:18:53.243
in one week, I am going to hire a mass
of mercenaries to hunt you down

01:18:53.368 --> 01:18:57.247
and chop off the protruding parts
of your body. Is that clear?

01:18:57.372 --> 01:19:00.542
I'll find her. I mean, you'll have
your daughter soon. Bye!

01:19:01.459 --> 01:19:04.879
Andrew. Point the boat back to Elk Snout.

01:19:05.630 --> 01:19:08.550
You and Mommy are going
to take a little trip, aren't we?

01:19:08.675 --> 01:19:11.052
We's gonna go bye-bye, yes!

01:19:14.556 --> 01:19:18.017
- Sit there and don't get dirty!
- I hate this.

01:19:18.143 --> 01:19:21.020
It's not so bad to get dressed up
every once in a while.

01:19:21.146 --> 01:19:23.398
It's like the goddamn Brady Bunch!

01:19:24.733 --> 01:19:27.736
- Dad's here!
- Mom, Dad's home!

01:19:27.861 --> 01:19:29.904
Hey, guys!

01:19:31.156 --> 01:19:34.242
I gotta go put on a suit.
Gertie's picking me up.

01:19:34.367 --> 01:19:36.911
How can you go hunting
on such an important day?

01:19:37.036 --> 01:19:41.166
- Easy. Pheasant don't play miniature golf.
- Hunting calms Billy down, honey.

01:19:41.291 --> 01:19:45.795
- The ceremonies start in an hour.
- Billy, hang this guy out.

01:19:45.920 --> 01:19:48.131
Sweetie, I'll be ready... in a second.

01:19:48.256 --> 01:19:51.634
I lent the station wagon to Gertie
so we have to take the truck.

01:19:51.760 --> 01:19:53.595
God! What a mess.

01:19:56.014 --> 01:19:58.057
Feathers!

01:20:08.485 --> 01:20:10.862
"JS".

01:20:12.739 --> 01:20:14.991
Honey, would you hand me a towel there?

01:20:15.116 --> 01:20:16.993
Thanks.

01:20:17.118 --> 01:20:19.079
What... What is this?

01:20:19.204 --> 01:20:21.664
No, that's my question.
They were in the truck.

01:20:22.540 --> 01:20:25.085
These are... I dunno what these are.
I... Who...

01:20:25.210 --> 01:20:28.046
Here. I, uh, we gotta get going.
We're gonna be late.

01:20:28.171 --> 01:20:30.340
Thanks for putting my clothes on the bed.

01:20:30.465 --> 01:20:32.801
- Oh, stop it!
- This is nothing!

01:20:32.926 --> 01:20:36.054
Nothing?
I gave you the best years of my life.

01:20:36.179 --> 01:20:38.181
I've raised your children.

01:20:38.306 --> 01:20:41.810
I bore your fruit four times
and you tell me this is nothing?

01:20:41.935 --> 01:20:44.354
You're making a big deal
out of a little thing.

01:20:44.479 --> 01:20:47.399
It's the number one cause
of divorce in this country.

01:20:47.524 --> 01:20:50.568
Where's my jacket? What divorce?
What are you saying...

01:20:50.693 --> 01:20:54.114
- I'm saying what I'm saying.
- You're saying what you're saying!

01:20:54.239 --> 01:20:57.325
- What, you wanna divorce?
- Well, uh... yeah, maybe I do!

01:20:57.450 --> 01:21:00.912
- Well, you can't have one.
- Oh, really. I can have a divorce.

01:21:01.037 --> 01:21:04.833
- Where did I put my damn boots?
- I can get a divorce if I want to.

01:21:04.958 --> 01:21:07.419
I don't need your permission.

01:21:09.421 --> 01:21:11.464
Do you love her?

01:21:14.217 --> 01:21:16.553
Do you?

01:21:17.595 --> 01:21:19.639
Tell me.

01:21:19.764 --> 01:21:22.684
Honestly? Yes and no.

01:21:23.268 --> 01:21:27.397
- More yes than no?
- This is unbelievable! How did you...?!

01:21:27.522 --> 01:21:30.775
I'm glad this happened.

01:21:30.900 --> 01:21:35.905
I've been tryin' to figure out a way to tell
you this for ever. Come here. Sit down.

01:21:36.030 --> 01:21:38.074
I wanna tell you something.

01:21:39.325 --> 01:21:44.122
JS is you. These are yours and we're not
married. There. God, I finally said it!

01:21:44.247 --> 01:21:46.291
What's her name? Jacqueline? Josie?

01:21:46.416 --> 01:21:49.043
Honey, I'm not your husband
and you're not my wife.

01:21:49.169 --> 01:21:52.338
Is she from that fertiliser plant?
Does she hand out shovels?

01:21:52.464 --> 01:21:55.550
These aren't your kids!
You didn't bear anything!

01:21:55.675 --> 01:21:58.762
- Don't change the subject! Who is she?!
- Forget it! Come here!

01:22:00.305 --> 01:22:04.225
- Guys, we gotta talk and this is serious.
- Mom, we're still all clean!

01:22:04.350 --> 01:22:08.480
I just told her about her not being your
mother and I want you to tell her, too.

01:22:12.067 --> 01:22:15.779
- Go ahead, tell her.
- Dad, tell her what?

01:22:15.904 --> 01:22:18.907
- Tell her she's not your mother.
- But she is our mother!

01:22:19.032 --> 01:22:23.495
No. Don't tell her what I told you
to tell her. Just tell her the truth now, OK?

01:22:23.620 --> 01:22:26.664
- Tell her about the day she came home!
- She went for a swim.

01:22:26.790 --> 01:22:29.501
We were really worried.
I was up all night pacing.

01:22:29.626 --> 01:22:34.214
- You'd never seen her before!
- Don't speak to my children that way!

01:22:36.132 --> 01:22:39.719
- What do you think you're doing?
- We won't let you ruin <i>everything</i>.

01:22:39.844 --> 01:22:42.388
- We're keepin' her.
- She doesn't belong to you!

01:22:42.514 --> 01:22:45.183
She didn't belong to you,
but that didn't stop you!

01:22:45.308 --> 01:22:47.769
- I had my reasons!
- So do we.

01:22:48.853 --> 01:22:50.897
- We like her, Dad!
- You like her, do you?

01:22:51.022 --> 01:22:54.150
So much you'd rather live with her
than your own father?!

01:23:01.157 --> 01:23:04.953
- Found 'em in the glove compartment?
- Yeah. Tell me every sordid detail.

01:23:05.078 --> 01:23:07.622
Who is JS and what does she do to Dean?

01:23:07.747 --> 01:23:10.708
- Annie...
- Tell me everything. Be honest with me.

01:23:10.834 --> 01:23:13.920
Annie, uh... That's my underwear.

01:23:15.588 --> 01:23:18.883
- What?
- I don't mean I wear it or anything.

01:23:19.008 --> 01:23:21.719
- It belongs to a girlfriend.
- What about Gertie?

01:23:21.845 --> 01:23:25.640
I strayed. See, I got lucky
with this phone-sex girl one night.

01:23:25.765 --> 01:23:28.435
I found one that accepted
personal cheques and...

01:23:28.560 --> 01:23:32.564
You see, I don't have a back seat
in my truck so I... I used yours.

01:23:32.689 --> 01:23:35.817
Dean doesn't want you to tell Gert,
so he's covering for me.

01:23:35.942 --> 01:23:39.279
- What are you talking about?
- I confessed. The jig is up.

01:23:39.404 --> 01:23:42.198
The jig <i>is</i> up!
I'm finally trying to tell her the truth.

01:23:42.323 --> 01:23:47.454
I just did. See, I didn't get the reputation
for being Bad Billy Pratt by accident.

01:23:47.579 --> 01:23:49.873
Annie, I'm sorry.

01:23:49.998 --> 01:23:52.041
I got horny.

01:23:52.167 --> 01:23:55.086
- Do you hate me?
- Oh, no, I don't hate you.

01:23:55.754 --> 01:23:59.716
- I'm glad you're bad, Billy Pratt.
- Biggest load of bullshit I've seen.

01:23:59.841 --> 01:24:04.721
Honey, honey. Phone-for-sex girls
don't come to your truck, honey. They...

01:24:04.846 --> 01:24:08.475
No, stop trying to cover for him, sweetie.
Let's just forget it.

01:24:08.600 --> 01:24:12.562
Pretty expensive panties.
You can have these back.

01:24:12.687 --> 01:24:15.190
That girl must have more than one phone.

01:24:16.775 --> 01:24:18.610
Pretty good, huh?

01:24:18.735 --> 01:24:22.113
You did this to protect your ass
because you faked my pictures?

01:24:22.238 --> 01:24:26.409
No, I did it to protect <i>your</i> ass, OK?
You belong with her.

01:24:46.054 --> 01:24:48.098
Oh, cute.

01:24:48.223 --> 01:24:51.226
Mom! Help, he has my hand.

01:24:51.351 --> 01:24:54.646
Why do you stick your hands
in people's mouths, anyway?

01:24:54.771 --> 01:24:56.898
Let's go. Let's go to another one.

01:25:07.534 --> 01:25:10.328
I have been calling all over Elk Cove.

01:25:10.453 --> 01:25:15.625
No, no. Don't worry. No, no.
I will try Portland for a limousine.

01:25:17.043 --> 01:25:19.921
I really don't have anything
to say except that, uh...

01:25:20.046 --> 01:25:24.801
there would be no Wonders of the World
miniature golf course if it wasn't for

01:25:24.926 --> 01:25:28.138
the imagination
and the creativity of one woman.

01:25:28.888 --> 01:25:32.267
That's my Annie.
Annie, you wanna come up here?

01:25:37.689 --> 01:25:40.942
I love you, Annie.
I want you to be with me always.

01:25:55.749 --> 01:25:58.585
Everybody, play ball!

01:26:01.588 --> 01:26:03.590
Let's go clean up.

01:26:36.623 --> 01:26:40.710
- Hey, Dad! Whose car is that?
- Maybe it's a rich relative.

01:26:40.835 --> 01:26:45.757
- Sure, it's Daddy Warbucks!
- Maybe we won the lottery.

01:27:05.527 --> 01:27:09.322
Hi, Grant!
I just have to put these in some water.

01:27:25.588 --> 01:27:28.299
Grant? Is that you?

01:27:33.805 --> 01:27:36.266
Yes.

01:27:36.391 --> 01:27:39.602
Yes, you're Grant Stayton III.

01:27:41.688 --> 01:27:43.815
I remember!

01:27:43.940 --> 01:27:47.527
I remember. I'm Joanna Stayton.

01:27:50.530 --> 01:27:54.325
Ooh! Dean, I'm cured.

01:27:54.451 --> 01:27:56.494
I can remember again.

01:27:57.203 --> 01:27:58.872
Oh, God!

01:27:58.997 --> 01:28:02.500
You can't imagine how terrible it is
not to know who you are.

01:28:02.625 --> 01:28:06.921
The doctor said that my mind would
come back suddenly and he was right.

01:28:07.046 --> 01:28:10.884
I saw you, I walked past you into the
house and poof! My memory came back.

01:28:11.009 --> 01:28:14.387
Ask me anything.
Ask me about my childhood in New York.

01:28:14.512 --> 01:28:16.806
Uh, about my mom. Her name is Edith.

01:28:16.931 --> 01:28:18.933
About my money. Money!

01:28:19.059 --> 01:28:22.645
I have money! I have lots of money!
I even have some in Switzerland!

01:28:22.771 --> 01:28:24.814
- Switzerland?
- See how I know me?

01:28:24.939 --> 01:28:27.525
Oh, God, this is
the happiest day of my life!

01:28:27.650 --> 01:28:30.195
Oh, thank you.
Thank you for bringing me here

01:28:30.320 --> 01:28:32.822
and making me a wife and a mother and...

01:28:32.947 --> 01:28:34.991
Why did you do that?

01:28:38.870 --> 01:28:41.164
Why...?

01:28:41.289 --> 01:28:43.333
I know why.

01:28:45.210 --> 01:28:47.962
You're that sweaty carpenter
who hates me.

01:28:54.344 --> 01:28:57.347
And these are your children,
and you made me

01:28:58.556 --> 01:29:00.767
believe that...

01:29:06.648 --> 01:29:08.775
Oh, God...

01:29:10.652 --> 01:29:12.695
You tricked me.

01:29:14.280 --> 01:29:16.324
You used me.

01:29:20.578 --> 01:29:22.622
Say something.

01:29:24.833 --> 01:29:28.253
- Annie, it just started out...
- My name is not Annie.

01:29:30.630 --> 01:29:32.674
And I don't belong with you.

01:29:34.717 --> 01:29:36.761
And I don't belong with them.

01:29:38.722 --> 01:29:41.391
I have to... get my things.

01:29:48.148 --> 01:29:50.650
Don't get any ideas. I brought Olaf.

01:29:50.775 --> 01:29:52.152
Olaf!

01:29:56.156 --> 01:29:58.116
I think we can take Olaf.

01:30:14.340 --> 01:30:16.176
I won't have...

01:30:19.095 --> 01:30:21.473
There's nothing inside that's mine.

01:30:30.690 --> 01:30:34.360
Joanna, for whatever it's worth,

01:30:35.862 --> 01:30:37.113
thank you.

01:30:49.876 --> 01:30:51.920
Come on, dear.

01:30:55.548 --> 01:30:57.842
We'll get you out of these clothes.

01:31:20.198 --> 01:31:22.367
- Mom, wait!
- Mom!

01:31:22.492 --> 01:31:25.286
- Mom!
- Mom, come back!

01:31:39.300 --> 01:31:42.095
- You said moms don't leave!
- Get!

01:31:58.361 --> 01:32:00.655
We should have told her, Dad.

01:32:00.780 --> 01:32:02.824
She just would have left sooner.

01:32:04.325 --> 01:32:06.369
Come on.

01:32:29.392 --> 01:32:31.436
Welcome back, Mrs Stayton.

01:33:16.815 --> 01:33:20.777
Dr Korman, will she ever again
be the debutante I raised?

01:33:20.902 --> 01:33:24.739
- Will she be one of us?
- Joanna wants to rediscover her old self.

01:33:25.323 --> 01:33:27.700
Her memory's almost
completely restored.

01:33:27.826 --> 01:33:30.370
She even recalled the session
where I wrote this.

01:33:30.495 --> 01:33:34.332
D I love you madly
though you treat me badly...

01:33:34.457 --> 01:33:36.835
Dr Korman! Please!

01:33:36.960 --> 01:33:40.922
We need analysis, not "Moon River"!
I want my wife back.

01:33:41.047 --> 01:33:44.592
Joanna knows who she is.
And she's trying to behave that way.

01:33:44.717 --> 01:33:45.802
Happy?

01:33:45.927 --> 01:33:48.138
Good evening, madam.

01:33:48.263 --> 01:33:52.350
- Ah, my darling Joanna.
- You look radiant, Jo-Jo.

01:33:52.475 --> 01:33:56.062
Oh, please don't call me that.
I feel like a Pomeranian.

01:33:56.187 --> 01:33:59.232
You liked being called Jo-Jo.
It was diddums you hated.

01:33:59.357 --> 01:34:04.154
Mother, why does Dr Korman have to be
here? I feel self-conscious enough as it is.

01:34:04.279 --> 01:34:08.158
Oh, sweetie. Just indulge Mommy, hm?

01:34:08.283 --> 01:34:11.286
Come along, now. Sit, sit, sit.

01:34:11.411 --> 01:34:13.455
Andrew, I'm sitting.

01:34:17.041 --> 01:34:18.877
Now, Mrs Mintz.

01:34:19.627 --> 01:34:24.215
Dr Korman knows you so well, dear,
and he only wants to help.

01:34:24.340 --> 01:34:27.469
- Champagne, madam.
- Ah, thank you, Andrew.

01:34:29.387 --> 01:34:32.265
- Andrew, I'd love a beer.
- A beer?

01:34:33.391 --> 01:34:36.895
- It's wrong, isn't it?
- Nothing is ever wrong.

01:34:37.020 --> 01:34:41.816
Actually, I really don't see the harm
in accommodating her wishes, Andrew.

01:34:43.735 --> 01:34:47.572
- Cigarette, darling?
- I don't smoke, Mother. Do I?

01:34:47.697 --> 01:34:49.991
Of course you smoke.
You've always smoked.

01:34:50.116 --> 01:34:52.660
- I smoke.
- Why don't we all smoke?

01:34:53.536 --> 01:34:57.123
Why do I have to smoke? I've never
smoked. I get sick when I smoke.

01:34:57.248 --> 01:34:59.959
Why does everyone try to make me
do what I don't want to do?

01:35:00.085 --> 01:35:03.588
Grant, we are not interested
in <i>your</i> therapy.

01:35:03.713 --> 01:35:08.468
I had my nervous breakdown and
I didn't have therapy. I never had therapy!

01:35:09.594 --> 01:35:12.180
- Mother, would you like some?
- I'd love some.

01:35:12.305 --> 01:35:15.725
Put that down! Good God, Joanna!
We have servants for that.

01:35:15.850 --> 01:35:17.852
Now, really, this is going too far.

01:35:17.977 --> 01:35:21.356
Joanna, what motivated you
to rise and go get the serving tray?

01:35:22.982 --> 01:35:25.735
Well, I thought you might be hungry.

01:35:25.860 --> 01:35:28.613
- That's excellent.
- What's excellent about it?

01:35:28.738 --> 01:35:32.325
- I was hungry.
- Your beer, madam.

01:35:32.450 --> 01:35:35.286
Who cares that you were hungry!
She became a waitress!

01:35:35.412 --> 01:35:37.872
- My daughter's a waitress?!
- Hold it.

01:35:40.250 --> 01:35:42.335
Mm!

01:35:42.460 --> 01:35:44.504
Good stuff.

01:35:52.095 --> 01:35:54.931
I'll stay an extra few days, yes.

01:36:06.234 --> 01:36:08.653
- They won't come in.
- Shit.

01:36:16.244 --> 01:36:18.413
Spaghettio Surprise.

01:36:26.588 --> 01:36:29.424
- What's goin' on?
- We're gettin' Mom back.

01:36:29.549 --> 01:36:32.886
- We miss her.
- Yeah, she cuts the crusts off the bread.

01:36:33.011 --> 01:36:36.473
She doesn't take any of my shit either.
I need discipline.

01:36:36.598 --> 01:36:38.141
We got $3.04.

01:36:38.266 --> 01:36:41.311
We're gonna rent a fishing boat
and get her back.

01:36:41.436 --> 01:36:44.981
No fishing boat's gonna catch a yacht,
especially at that price.

01:36:45.106 --> 01:36:49.527
- Maybe she'll decide to come back.
- Dumbo, she's on her way to New York!

01:36:49.652 --> 01:36:53.198
- This is a job for Dr Death.
- Yeah, Dr Death could do it!

01:36:53.323 --> 01:36:55.366
We gotta do somethin'. Right, Dad?

01:36:55.492 --> 01:36:57.202
Wrong!

01:36:57.327 --> 01:36:59.370
Now, she's gone, guys.

01:36:59.496 --> 01:37:01.164
She hates me!

01:37:02.040 --> 01:37:06.795
She's got her rich husband back...
and her rich life and that's the end of it.

01:37:29.984 --> 01:37:32.779
I love the sound of the ocean.

01:37:33.822 --> 01:37:36.699
Hallo-ooo!

01:37:40.286 --> 01:37:41.955
Tofutti.

01:37:42.080 --> 01:37:44.833
Ah, Tofutti, where are you
when I need you?

01:37:44.958 --> 01:37:49.879
Tofutti Klein-ein-ein-ein...

01:37:50.004 --> 01:37:52.048
All together. And!

01:37:52.215 --> 01:37:55.009
Lick, shake, lick.

01:37:55.468 --> 01:37:56.636
Drink!

01:37:58.054 --> 01:38:00.265
Suck!

01:38:01.808 --> 01:38:04.894
- You sucked first!
- No, I didn't! I did it right!

01:38:05.937 --> 01:38:08.231
- Danger watch! Gotta go! Let's go!
- Oh, yes.

01:38:09.107 --> 01:38:10.692
Croissants in the morning!

01:38:10.817 --> 01:38:14.279
- Dinner was wonderful.
- <i>Merci beaucoup. Bonne nuit</i>.

01:38:14.404 --> 01:38:17.115
You best not lose these again, madam.

01:38:17.240 --> 01:38:19.659
- Again?
- With my apologies, madam.

01:38:19.784 --> 01:38:23.747
"Andrew! I seem to have lost
my ruby earrings somewhere between...

01:38:23.872 --> 01:38:27.959
...<i>6</i> 4th... and <i>6</i> 8th Streets."

01:38:28.084 --> 01:38:29.878
"Find them!"

01:38:30.962 --> 01:38:35.675
I've behaved so badly. I don't know
how you put up with me for so long.

01:38:36.760 --> 01:38:39.262
You've done so many
wonderful things for me

01:38:39.387 --> 01:38:41.848
and I've never even once said thank you.

01:38:43.349 --> 01:38:45.393
I'm sorry.

01:38:47.979 --> 01:38:50.023
Apology accepted, ma'am.

01:38:51.357 --> 01:38:54.527
Everyone thinks I'm crazy.
Do you think they're right?

01:38:54.986 --> 01:38:57.238
Oh, no, madam. Oh, no.

01:38:58.281 --> 01:39:02.077
Most of us... go through life
with blinders on, madam,

01:39:03.787 --> 01:39:07.040
knowing only that one little station
to which we were born.

01:39:07.165 --> 01:39:10.710
But you, madam, on the other hand,
have had the rare privilege

01:39:10.835 --> 01:39:14.172
of escaping your bonds for just a spell

01:39:15.340 --> 01:39:18.426
to see life from an entirely
new perspective.

01:39:19.636 --> 01:39:24.808
How you choose to use that information,
madam, is entirely up to you.

01:39:45.078 --> 01:39:47.372
- Captain Karl?
- Yes, ma'am.

01:39:47.497 --> 01:39:50.375
- We've never really had time to talk.
- No, we haven't.

01:39:50.500 --> 01:39:52.544
Well, there's no time now.

01:39:53.336 --> 01:39:55.839
- What are you doing?
- Turning the boat around.

01:39:55.964 --> 01:39:58.842
- Why?
- I'm going home.

01:39:58.967 --> 01:40:01.720
You're turning that wheel too fast.

01:40:23.324 --> 01:40:27.078
Captain Karl! Why is the land
on the wrong side of the yacht?

01:40:29.539 --> 01:40:33.084
Oh, she did?
Well, she's gone too far this time.

01:40:33.209 --> 01:40:35.503
She thinks she's dealing with an idiot!

01:40:40.425 --> 01:40:42.886
So we're heading back
to the jungles of Oregon!

01:40:43.011 --> 01:40:45.305
- I want to go back, Grant.
- To him?

01:40:45.430 --> 01:40:47.474
Yes. I'm sorry.

01:40:48.892 --> 01:40:52.270
You haven't begun to be sorry,
you hillbilly harlot!

01:40:52.896 --> 01:40:56.066
Captain Karl, go below with the crew.
I'm taking over.

01:40:56.191 --> 01:40:58.234
Andrew, go get Dr Korman! Go!

01:40:58.359 --> 01:41:00.528
- Get out of my way, Karl!
- But, sir!

01:41:00.653 --> 01:41:02.655
Now I'm in charge!

01:41:02.781 --> 01:41:06.618
We're coming about... at full speed ahead!

01:41:23.510 --> 01:41:26.054
- Who is it?
- Dr Death. Let's go.

01:41:26.179 --> 01:41:28.223
We're gonna go get her!

01:41:28.348 --> 01:41:30.725
Come on! Billy's friends'll help us!

01:41:39.943 --> 01:41:42.904
- I hope I don't get court-martialled.
- Yeah, I owe you.

01:41:43.488 --> 01:41:47.033
- Anything in the manual?
- Not about pulling alongside a ship

01:41:47.158 --> 01:41:49.536
and telling a passenger
you love them, sir.

01:41:49.661 --> 01:41:52.664
Put your nose in the manual
and find something, Lucas!

01:41:53.248 --> 01:41:55.792
Whatever you do,
I'm getting off at the next port.

01:41:55.917 --> 01:41:58.670
Don't be ridiculous.
<i>Nobody</i> leaves a Stayton.

01:41:58.795 --> 01:42:01.965
I don't love you any more.
Please try and understand that.

01:42:02.090 --> 01:42:04.134
What has love got to do with marriage?

01:42:06.261 --> 01:42:09.681
You'd actually prefer living in squalor
with that cave dweller!

01:42:12.934 --> 01:42:15.729
They should have kept you
in the hospital psycho ward!

01:42:17.689 --> 01:42:19.941
What did you say?

01:42:20.066 --> 01:42:22.402
How did you know that?

01:42:22.902 --> 01:42:24.946
You left me there, didn't you?

01:42:27.282 --> 01:42:29.409
You snake!

01:42:30.577 --> 01:42:32.704
How could you do that?

01:42:32.829 --> 01:42:36.082
How could you be such a slime?

01:42:36.750 --> 01:42:40.295
Call me all the names you want,
but many women adore me!

01:42:40.420 --> 01:42:42.964
Do you wanna know what I was doing?
I'll tell you.

01:42:43.089 --> 01:42:46.426
I was whacking the donkey
with painted ladies. They loved me!

01:42:46.926 --> 01:42:49.345
Yes! I did leave you.

01:42:49.471 --> 01:42:52.724
There! Now I've confessed. So what?

01:42:52.849 --> 01:42:56.102
We're at sea. And I'm a god at sea!

01:43:00.106 --> 01:43:03.026
Nine o'clock in the morning.
This better be good.

01:43:03.151 --> 01:43:05.904
Doctor, Grant's having
another nervous breakdown.

01:43:06.029 --> 01:43:09.491
- He thinks he's God. Keep him busy.
- All right.

01:43:09.616 --> 01:43:12.118
- Morning, Grant.
- Korman, my wife is insane.

01:43:12.243 --> 01:43:14.871
- Do we have a straitjacket?
- I always carry one.

01:43:14.996 --> 01:43:16.748
Good! Put her in it!

01:43:19.042 --> 01:43:22.128
You're overwrought, Grant.
I want you to take a Valium.

01:43:22.253 --> 01:43:24.422
Here, take one of mine.

01:43:25.298 --> 01:43:27.592
- Is Nino here?
- Nino on break.

01:43:27.717 --> 01:43:30.720
I have to stop the boat.
My husband's a little bit crazy...

01:43:30.845 --> 01:43:33.223
- The captain stop the boat.
- I'm the captain!

01:43:33.348 --> 01:43:36.434
No, please don't salute!
I have to find a red button...

01:43:38.895 --> 01:43:40.939
Vessel sighted straight ahead, sir!

01:43:41.064 --> 01:43:44.401
- Identify.
- There's a fat guy in my way, sir.

01:43:44.526 --> 01:43:47.737
Who you callin' fat, you little weasel!
Come here!

01:43:49.406 --> 01:43:51.699
Where's the thing? I need the red...

01:43:51.825 --> 01:43:54.577
- Here! Here it is!
- No, please!

01:43:57.747 --> 01:43:59.791
- The boat stopped.
- Yes, it stopped!

01:43:59.916 --> 01:44:03.294
- I need to get it turned around.
- Nino on the break.

01:44:11.636 --> 01:44:13.680
He's here!

01:44:14.139 --> 01:44:17.559
He's here! That's him!

01:44:21.479 --> 01:44:25.692
Stop that boat immediately
and let me get my mom!

01:44:26.818 --> 01:44:28.737
- <i>Qu'est-ce que c'est?</i>
- Pee Wee Herman.

01:44:28.862 --> 01:44:33.283
- <i>Qui est-ce?</i>
- <i>Maman! Qu'est-ce qu'on mange ce soir?</i>

01:44:33.408 --> 01:44:35.910
<i>Come in, Immaculata</i>.

01:44:36.327 --> 01:44:39.330
- He's here!
- There's mutiny afoot.

01:44:45.503 --> 01:44:49.758
She's at the bottom of this mutiny.
I'm gonna rid myself of this albatross.

01:44:59.059 --> 01:45:01.102
He's here!

01:45:08.068 --> 01:45:11.321
- Go back to New York, Dr Korman.
- Really? Thank you.

01:45:11.446 --> 01:45:13.490
- Dean!
- Madam! The ship has stopped.

01:45:13.615 --> 01:45:15.658
What happened? Did he strike you?

01:45:15.784 --> 01:45:19.037
- Did he make you do something?
- No! Everything's wonderful.

01:45:19.162 --> 01:45:23.041
- Message over the radio, sir.
- Annie! Ha-ha!

01:45:23.166 --> 01:45:26.795
Looks like the fun's over. We've got some
salmon poachers fishing in illegal waters.

01:45:26.920 --> 01:45:28.953
That takes precedence
over your friend's love life.

01:45:29.053 --> 01:45:31.424
- Come about!
- Son, no more radio.

01:45:31.549 --> 01:45:34.594
Hey! Hey! Hey, wait a... Hey!

01:45:34.719 --> 01:45:37.263
- Billy, what's goin' on?
- We're turnin' round.

01:45:37.389 --> 01:45:39.391
They're going after salmon poachers.

01:45:39.516 --> 01:45:43.895
He's leaving. Where's he going?

01:45:56.241 --> 01:45:59.828
- Catarina!
- Arturo!

01:46:06.543 --> 01:46:08.420
I'm coming!

01:46:08.545 --> 01:46:12.716
- Man overboard!
- Shit! Sound the horn.

01:46:12.841 --> 01:46:16.177
Coming about again, Czapowskyj.

01:46:16.302 --> 01:46:18.888
Annie!

01:46:19.013 --> 01:46:21.349
Oh, no, madam. I cannot let you do this!

01:46:21.474 --> 01:46:24.144
- What?
- Not without a lifejacket.

01:46:24.853 --> 01:46:27.105
Dean! I'm coming!

01:46:27.230 --> 01:46:30.567
Madam, you really should
play a little hard to get.

01:46:30.692 --> 01:46:32.944
Tell my mother I'll call her!

01:46:35.071 --> 01:46:39.242
Woman overboard!
She's wearing an evening dress, sir.

01:46:39.367 --> 01:46:42.162
Get those kids out of the rescue boat.
Let's go!

01:46:42.287 --> 01:46:44.789
My mom's out there! Let me...

01:46:44.914 --> 01:46:47.041
Halt! You treasonous tramp!

01:46:47.167 --> 01:46:50.086
Conspiring with the enemy
at sea is mutiny!

01:46:50.837 --> 01:46:52.338
Pull!

01:46:56.634 --> 01:46:58.678
<i>Another man overboard!</i>

01:46:59.179 --> 01:47:01.181
I am giving my notice, sir!

01:47:11.566 --> 01:47:15.445
- Annie!
- Oh, Dean!

01:47:20.533 --> 01:47:22.160
Annie!

01:47:40.136 --> 01:47:43.098
I love you! I'll never leave you again!

01:47:43.223 --> 01:47:46.476
I'll never let you go!
You're my Annie. You always will be.

01:47:47.143 --> 01:47:49.729
Man overboard
is kissing woman overboard.

01:47:50.563 --> 01:47:52.816
Our rescue boat is starboard.

01:47:53.358 --> 01:47:56.653
The guy with the arrows
is being pulled in at port.

01:47:56.778 --> 01:47:59.406
It's a helluva day at sea, sir.

01:48:01.449 --> 01:48:05.578
- I can't believe you did it.
- Oh, I saw you jump so I jumped.

01:48:05.703 --> 01:48:07.747
No, I don't mean that.

01:48:07.872 --> 01:48:10.417
I can't believe
you gave all that up just for me.

01:48:10.542 --> 01:48:12.877
- I didn't.
- What do... What do you mean?

01:48:13.002 --> 01:48:15.046
Well, the truth is that it's mine.

01:48:15.171 --> 01:48:17.882
The boat, the money, everything.
It's all mine.

01:48:18.007 --> 01:48:20.885
Dean! Dean, it's OK!

01:48:31.020 --> 01:48:33.064
Oh! Did you tell 'em?

01:48:33.189 --> 01:48:35.066
Yeah.

01:48:35.191 --> 01:48:38.445
- They're making out their Christmas lists.
- Oh, already?

01:48:39.154 --> 01:48:41.281
How do you spell Porsche?

01:48:43.491 --> 01:48:45.535
They got me thinking, though.

01:48:46.119 --> 01:48:50.206
What can I possibly give you, ever,
that you don't already have?

01:48:57.505 --> 01:48:59.549
A little girl.

01:49:11.061 --> 01:49:13.104
<i>~ Different people ~</i>

01:49:14.203 --> 01:49:16.739

01:50:11.538 --> 01:50:13.581
<i>~ It's all right ~</i>

01:50:13.957 --> 01:50:16.000
<i>~ Baby, it's OK ~</i>

01:50:18.128 --> 01:50:19.879
<i>~ We're gonna make it ~</i>

01:50:20.004 --> 01:50:22.048
<i>~ No matter what they say ~</i>

01:50:23.383 --> 01:50:25.802
<i>~ Sure as the stars shine ~</i>

01:50:25.927 --> 01:50:28.805

01:50:28.930 --> 01:50:33.143
<i>~ There is something special</i>
<i>about our love ~</i>

01:50:54.456 --> 01:50:56.499
<i>~ People change ~</i>

01:50:56.750 --> 01:50:58.793
<i>~ As time goes by ~</i>

01:51:00.754 --> 01:51:03.048
<i>~ Others come between ~</i>

01:51:07.135 --> 01:51:09.637
<i>~ But I'll love you ~</i>

01:51:09.763 --> 01:51:12.140
<i>~ Till the day I die ~</i>

01:51:13.058 --> 01:51:16.436
