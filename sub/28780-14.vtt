32:43.494 --> 32:44.595

- Yeah.

32:44.662 --> 32:46.230
- So, on normal portrait day,

32:46.297 --> 32:48.032
I would've made it look
exactly like her,

32:48.099 --> 32:49.567
but since we're asking
for traditional,

32:49.634 --> 32:51.769
I had to change a little bit

32:51.836 --> 32:53.805

with the way you tattooed.

32:57.308 --> 32:59.143
You did great,
but one discrepancy

32:59.210 --> 33:00.778
throws off the entire shape.

33:00.845 --> 33:02.814
