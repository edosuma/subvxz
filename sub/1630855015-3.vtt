WEBVTT

00:23.632 --> 00:24.674
Hey, Pop.

00:24.674 --> 00:26.717
Hey, son.

00:27.551 --> 00:31.348
I've thought it over and I really think
you should come and see the Swede.

00:31.348 --> 00:32.431
Get inside this.

00:33.432 --> 00:36.603
Okay, yeah.

00:36.603 --> 00:40.523
Come on, he likes you.
You'll keep it light.

00:40.523 --> 00:44.319
Well, you know, the only thing is,
Con's wedding.

00:44.319 --> 00:47.072
- It'll be okay.
- Are you gonna make it at all?

00:48.198 --> 00:52.994
We got him some Napoleon thing,
you said?

00:52.994 --> 00:54.912
Napoleon and Josephine letters.

00:54.912 --> 00:57.499
Let him know that I'll call him
when I have a minute.

00:57.499 --> 00:59.083
And listen,

00:59.626 --> 01:06.090
I'm feeling now more and more,
I'm uncomfortable with Gerri,

01:06.675 --> 01:11.096
how she's handled things
on the DOJ number, on the spin-off.

01:11.637 --> 01:12.972
Yeah?

01:12.972 --> 01:15.767
Yeah, I think we wanna let her go.

01:17.644 --> 01:21.940
Right, okay, well, let's discuss.

01:22.815 --> 01:25.068
So will you give her the heads up?

01:26.194 --> 01:27.404
Me?

01:27.404 --> 01:29.822
Yeah, I think it would be nicer
coming from you.

01:29.822 --> 01:32.367
I mean, you two, you know,
you were close.

01:33.493 --> 01:36.329
- Dad.
- I mean, you are with me?

01:36.329 --> 01:37.956
You weren't just fucking me around?

01:38.999 --> 01:43.752
- Well, sure, yeah.
- We'll make it tidy afterwards.

01:44.379 --> 01:47.048
Just give her the word today.
Thank you.

02:05.233 --> 02:09.278
Just checking, he definitely doesn't
want me coming with you guys?

02:09.278 --> 02:10.906
Doesn't, correct.

02:10.906 --> 02:14.409
And should I speak to him direct
or to Kerry to apologize?

02:14.409 --> 02:17.453
No, you're in the bad books.
Just keep your head down.

02:17.453 --> 02:21.791
have a little list of nice things
to say to Kerry.

02:21.791 --> 02:23.500
Well, that sounds creepy.

02:23.500 --> 02:24.794
It's not creepy.

02:24.794 --> 02:27.923
No, listen, look, Greg,
it's not your fault,

02:27.923 --> 02:30.215
but he just finds you visually
aggravating right now.

02:30.759 --> 02:32.760
Visually aggravating?

02:33.385 --> 02:34.553
He's so petty.

02:34.553 --> 02:37.933
Do you have all the support
that you need for Sweden?

02:37.933 --> 02:41.478
Yeah, I got like three,
four people Gregging for me.

02:42.687 --> 02:43.980
- Gregging?
- Yeah.

02:43.980 --> 02:46.774
I roped in a few of the mini Gregs
from the pig pen.

02:46.774 --> 02:48.652
Little Greglets.

02:48.652 --> 02:51.738
Okay, well don't turn me into a word,
Tom, I'm a guy.

02:52.446 --> 02:55.951
Why do you have all these little guys,
these little Greggies running around?

02:55.951 --> 02:57.410
Who are these little Gregs?

02:57.410 --> 02:58.661
The boat leaves in 30

02:58.661 --> 03:00.705
and there's champagne
and canapes 'till Ellis Island

03:00.705 --> 03:04.251
and there'll be something more
substantial after the ceremony.

03:04.251 --> 03:05.709
Look at that boat!

03:05.709 --> 03:09.296
Willa, it's like you're a Princess
in a film.

03:09.798 --> 03:11.132
Thank you.

03:11.132 --> 03:14.970
I mean, all in all, I guess it's not
exactly what we expected,

03:14.970 --> 03:17.389
but it's fine.

03:17.389 --> 03:19.766
- He'll look after you.
- He will.

03:20.809 --> 03:22.769
Not looking, I'm not looking.

03:22.769 --> 03:24.854
- Okay, I'll go, I'm going.
- No bad luck.

03:26.981 --> 03:30.193
- Hi.
- Connor. It's all so lovely.

03:30.859 --> 03:35.197
My God.
Look at all the young people.

03:35.656 --> 03:37.826
I heard a few of them moaning
about the rich.

03:37.826 --> 03:40.869
Well, they don't mind the taste
of your champagne.

03:40.869 --> 03:43.623
Mr. Scrooge just happened
to be a huge wealth creator.

03:43.623 --> 03:45.749
They don't mention that
in Mr. Dickens' books, do they?

03:45.749 --> 03:48.460
No, they do not, very convenient.

03:55.759 --> 03:59.514
Hail Loganus Maximus,
slayer of vikings.

03:59.514 --> 04:01.098
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.

04:01.432 --> 04:04.560
So, what have you got
on Matsson for me?

04:04.560 --> 04:07.646
Well, playing hardball, but
everybody says he still wants the deal.

04:07.646 --> 04:11.817
There's still a bit of grumbles
about the ATN carve out...

04:11.817 --> 04:13.528
Well, that's not on the table.

04:13.528 --> 04:17.072
Right.
He's playing tough,

04:17.072 --> 04:20.076
but if there was no upside,
he wouldn't be making the time.

04:23.204 --> 04:27.542
I think today's the day.
I'll talk to Cyd.

04:29.169 --> 04:31.588
You mean like...

04:31.588 --> 04:35.591
And Gerri,
find out when he's done it.

04:36.425 --> 04:37.969
- Karolina.
- Yes.

04:38.428 --> 04:40.220
Gerri's getting the push.

04:40.220 --> 04:43.433
- Okay.
- What?

04:43.433 --> 04:44.642
Nothing.

04:44.642 --> 04:47.102
We'll her today, swing in the legals.

04:47.770 --> 04:51.900
We can begin to let it seep,
hang cruisers around her neck.

04:51.900 --> 04:54.360
Sort of incompetence or worse.

04:54.360 --> 04:57.906
I think the idea would be
that she took her eye off the ball.

04:58.281 --> 05:01.533
Clean out the stalls,
strategic refocus.

05:02.786 --> 05:04.578
A bit more fucking aggressive.

05:05.245 --> 05:09.292
You push Cyd, Roman
knives Gerri, all in a day's work.

06:31.707 --> 06:34.126
SUCCESSION

06:50.435 --> 06:53.313
Hey! What you heard about
Matsson? The deal gonna be all right?

06:55.398 --> 06:57.150
- You all right?
- Yeah.

06:57.150 --> 06:58.860
Fuck you, I'm great, why?

06:58.860 --> 07:01.028
I don't know, fuck you,
I'm just asking.

07:01.028 --> 07:03.447
I'm fine. Let's just enjoy
this sham marriage

07:03.447 --> 07:05.909
and the death of romance,
it's gonna be great.

07:07.327 --> 07:10.621
Okay, let me know
if you hear from him.

07:12.498 --> 07:14.292
- Fuck off.
- You are.

07:15.418 --> 07:17.211
What? Talk, talk, talk, what?

07:17.211 --> 07:18.338
Hey, you done it?

07:18.338 --> 07:20.255
Your dad wants to know,
have you done it yet?

07:20.674 --> 07:24.094
No, Jesus. I just got off the phone
with him, okay?

07:24.094 --> 07:26.011
- She's not here yet.
- Are you going to do it?

07:26.011 --> 07:28.390
Yes, I'm going to do it.
I'll let you know.

07:28.390 --> 07:30.976
Back off,
you inflatable dicky-dick.

07:32.393 --> 07:33.560
Fucking asshole.

07:36.897 --> 07:40.819
Hello, Gerri! How are you doing?
You look well.

07:40.819 --> 07:43.070
- Thank you.
- I saw a client of mine, I'm gonna go.

07:43.070 --> 07:45.657
No worries.
You didn't have to go.

07:45.657 --> 07:51.036
What, no stupid jokes about Martin
or something disgusting about dicks

07:51.036 --> 07:52.497
or maybe vaginas?

07:52.497 --> 07:55.292
I'm just being nice,
can I not be nice anymore?

07:58.460 --> 08:00.380
- What?
- What?

08:00.380 --> 08:02.007
Why are you not looking at me?

08:02.007 --> 08:04.967
I will stare at you
as long as you want

08:04.967 --> 08:07.052
if that's what
you so desperately desire.

08:07.052 --> 08:08.513
What's going on, Roman?

08:08.513 --> 08:12.266
Nothing. You make me go weird,
as you know and fully intend.

08:13.476 --> 08:17.354
But we... Let's talk later, okay?

08:17.354 --> 08:21.275
Like in like 30 or whatever, once
we set sail, we should have a chat.

08:22.693 --> 08:23.904
What is it?

08:24.279 --> 08:25.989
What's going on? Tell me.

08:25.989 --> 08:28.783
I just need to talk with you,
that's all, we should do it later.

08:28.783 --> 08:33.120
It's better if we did it later, because
you can no doubt tell

08:33.120 --> 08:35.123
just from looking at me
that it's not great.

08:35.123 --> 08:38.417
But you know, Dad said it,
so it's a message.

08:38.417 --> 08:42.129
- Is this why I'm not going to Europe?
- Look, it's not official.

08:42.713 --> 08:46.468
And I'm just heads-upping you here, okay?

08:46.468 --> 08:50.012
But yeah, early warning, I did not
intend to talk about this right now.

08:50.012 --> 08:51.932
- But yeah, you're...
- Why?

08:52.641 --> 08:55.476
I guess he's just unhappy
about how long it took

08:55.476 --> 08:57.061
for you to settle with the DOJ.

08:57.061 --> 08:59.230
- Bullshit.
- The number, the fine, too big.

08:59.230 --> 09:02.691
I danced us through a fucking
thunderstorm without us getting wet.

09:02.691 --> 09:04.402
Guess you just lost his confidence.

09:04.402 --> 09:05.819
Since when?

09:05.819 --> 09:09.156
Since you sent me repeated
images of your genitalia?

09:09.156 --> 09:12.786
He really loved that
when that happened.

09:12.786 --> 09:15.037
I'm doing it with the courtesy
of letting you know.

09:15.037 --> 09:17.207
You can go legal if you'd like,

09:17.207 --> 09:20.626
but we're going to stuff your mouth
with so much fucking gold.

09:20.626 --> 09:24.214
This is, I mean, you know that
I am on like a human level,

09:24.214 --> 09:26.424
like obviously sad, but...

09:28.467 --> 09:30.552
- Hey, sorry,
- I'm good.

09:30.552 --> 09:32.930
This is fine.
This is nothing at all.

09:32.930 --> 09:35.433
Thank you for the consideration.

09:37.644 --> 09:39.186
Don't...

09:40.437 --> 09:41.397
Hi.

09:42.107 --> 09:44.276
We'll be boarding, we'll start
the boarding process,

09:44.276 --> 09:46.443
and we're going to start
with the red invites.

09:46.443 --> 09:49.781
Family and friends, welcome aboard!
I'm sorry.

09:50.364 --> 09:52.117
- The cake?
- Yes.

09:52.117 --> 09:53.660
It's inadequate.

10:08.757 --> 10:11.928
So I am saying that we can have it
as display, obviously,

10:11.928 --> 10:14.514
but I do not want it served, okay?

10:14.514 --> 10:19.435
I don't want to see
the internal qualities.

10:19.435 --> 10:21.479
- Yes?
- Okay.

10:21.479 --> 10:22.856
Thank you.

10:30.447 --> 10:34.158
Hey, Dad, can you call me back?

10:34.158 --> 10:38.203
That was horrible with Gerri.

10:38.203 --> 10:44.377
Don't listen to this
if you don't want to,

10:44.377 --> 10:49.423
but I'm not totally okay with...

10:49.423 --> 10:52.384
Are you kind of just being shitty
with me?

10:52.384 --> 10:54.345
Because your son is getting married,

10:54.345 --> 10:59.643
and you can't keep expecting me
to bend over for you,

10:59.643 --> 11:04.356
like being cunty, so I'm just asking,
so yeah, that's the question.

11:04.356 --> 11:06.816
Are you a cunt?
Okay, give me a buzz.

11:08.652 --> 11:10.235
Kidney chop!

11:13.448 --> 11:15.951
Good.
Good, that was a good one.

11:17.118 --> 11:18.787
- Should we go?
- Yeah, let's go.

11:19.746 --> 11:23.415
We got a head start on all
the fucky-clucky face people.

11:23.415 --> 11:27.295
Hi, look how lovely! Smooches!
Nice boat.

11:27.295 --> 11:29.756
- Hi, congratulations.
- Thank you.

11:29.756 --> 11:30.839
How's the groom?

11:32.132 --> 11:35.762
He's nervous about you guys
and his dad and the invited press,

11:35.762 --> 11:39.348
but he's fixated on the cake.
He says it's a loony cake.

11:41.392 --> 11:42.769
What is that?

11:44.354 --> 11:50.068
I believe when they told
Connor his mom was getting...

11:50.068 --> 11:51.486
Going to the funny farm.

11:51.486 --> 11:53.488
... mental health care,

11:53.488 --> 11:57.242
they gave him cake, dad and whoever,
just to calm him down,

11:57.242 --> 11:59.285
dab of sugar.

11:59.285 --> 12:03.748
So he was eating Victoria's sponge
for like a week straight.

12:03.748 --> 12:06.668
Right, so loony cake.

12:06.668 --> 12:10.005
Willa, I'm really looking forward
to saying hi to everyone

12:10.005 --> 12:13.215
and mixing it up and whatnot,
but is there an area where we can...

12:13.215 --> 12:16.011
Yeah, yeah, on the second floor,
there's an area.

12:16.011 --> 12:17.761
Thank you.
I want to meet everyone

12:17.761 --> 12:19.806
and get into it all about
their fucking jobs

12:19.806 --> 12:22.182
and children and everything,
but you know, thank you.

12:22.182 --> 12:24.560
Unbelievable.
Julie, can you believe this guy?

12:24.560 --> 12:27.563
- You're Julie?
- Yes. It's right this way.

12:27.563 --> 12:30.399
So what are you hearing?
Is he coming by?

12:30.399 --> 12:32.152
I have no idea.
I don't know.

12:32.694 --> 12:35.529
I'm hearing Stockholm,
gone or going.

12:37.032 --> 12:39.533
- Yeah.
- Okay.

12:39.533 --> 12:41.286
Matsson wouldn't fix it with him
on a phone?

12:41.286 --> 12:44.121
Journalism...
Taking quotes and kicking asses.

12:44.121 --> 12:45.414
You shouldn't talk to him.

12:45.414 --> 12:47.082
He likes to whip it out
to see if anyone notices.

12:47.082 --> 12:48.792
It's a sick game, Greggy.
Stop playing it.

12:48.792 --> 12:50.962
- No, bad!
- Hey, nice to see you.

12:50.962 --> 12:52.171
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

12:52.171 --> 12:55.299
Hey, guys.
Can I grab you for a sec?

12:55.299 --> 12:56.927
- No.
- Sorry.

12:56.927 --> 12:58.594
I just want to congratulate you
on everything.

12:58.594 --> 13:01.847
- Don't touch me.
- Get your nose out of our trough.

13:02.432 --> 13:05.310
You think Matsson is going to tell Dad
to just fuck off?

13:05.810 --> 13:07.853
He'll approve the offer
is what will happen.

13:08.939 --> 13:12.775
Dad's got to go fucking
Lingonberry picking with Matsson.

13:13.235 --> 13:15.320
Fucking puppet mastering
the old bastard.

13:16.195 --> 13:19.406
But what if the deal falls apart though?
It can.

13:19.908 --> 13:22.786
What's the latest from Naomi?
Still in touch with Naomi?

13:23.369 --> 13:24.620
He'll land it.

13:24.620 --> 13:27.207
And we will pocket
that sweet bonus loot.

13:29.125 --> 13:31.794
- There he is.
- Hey, hi.

13:34.296 --> 13:38.175
So the idea is that Dad will pop by,
be dockside,

13:38.175 --> 13:42.638
and you guys are up here.
And I think that's just cleanest.

13:43.348 --> 13:47.726
Okay.
You think he's going to pop by?

13:48.102 --> 13:50.105
I spoke with Kerry.
He's hoping.

13:50.647 --> 13:53.650
- Okay then.
- All right, thanks.

13:57.361 --> 13:59.906
Someone's gotta tell him.
We should tell him.

14:00.282 --> 14:01.782
We should tell him.

14:04.410 --> 14:07.622
- No, come on. Really?
- He likes you.

14:09.040 --> 14:11.918
Fine.
I'll be the wedding Grinch.

14:12.501 --> 14:15.130
- Fuck you.
- Good luck!

14:21.885 --> 14:24.681
Hello? Fucky-sucky brigade,
how can I help you?

14:26.974 --> 14:29.143
- Hey, Roman.
- Yeah.

14:29.935 --> 14:32.813
Your dad is very sick.
He's very, very sick.

14:32.813 --> 14:34.606
- What?
- What?

14:35.566 --> 14:39.486
Tom. Apparently Dad's sick.
What do you mean he's sick?

14:39.486 --> 14:42.032
- What's going on?
- Tom, are you still there?

14:42.032 --> 14:43.450
Is he okay?

14:43.450 --> 14:46.286
What's going on? What is it?
Is he okay?

14:46.286 --> 14:47.661
Who's with him?

14:49.706 --> 14:52.333
- Very serious.
- Serious what?

14:52.333 --> 14:55.085
It is very, very bad.
It seems very bad.

14:55.085 --> 14:57.672
- I'm so sorry to call you like this.
- Can you put him on the phone?

14:57.672 --> 15:00.508
Who's there? Tom,
what's going on? What happened?

15:00.508 --> 15:03.011
So, he was short of breath
and he went into the bathroom.

15:03.011 --> 15:07.473
Someone heard something
and we were concerned.

15:07.473 --> 15:09.893
- And then they went in there.
- They broke in?

15:09.893 --> 15:11.101
They broke in.

15:11.101 --> 15:13.979
They had the key and they got in,
but he's not responsive.

15:13.979 --> 15:16.732
- Is he still in there?
- He's non-responsive?

15:18.235 --> 15:20.361
- Yeah.
- Is he talking? Can he talk?

15:20.361 --> 15:21.988
Is he breathing?

15:22.906 --> 15:24.531
They're doing chest compressions.

15:24.531 --> 15:27.409
- Fuck!
- Has his heart stopped?

15:27.409 --> 15:29.620
- Has his heart stopped?
- I don't know.

15:29.620 --> 15:33.124
Do you have the machine on board?
The heart thing?

15:33.124 --> 15:35.626
- Defibrillator.
- I don't fucking know.

15:35.626 --> 15:38.504
What's going on, Tom?
Who's in charge?

15:39.464 --> 15:41.340
What is going on right now?

15:41.340 --> 15:45.260
- Karl said that maybe he's breathing.
- Who is medically competent there?

15:45.260 --> 15:48.348
They're trained.
The attendant is trained.

15:48.348 --> 15:50.016
I'm going to put you on speaker.
Hold on.

15:51.392 --> 15:54.561
The captain's been in touch.
He is in touch.

15:54.561 --> 16:01.568
The cabin staff are receiving
medical advice from their service.

16:01.568 --> 16:03.863
- They have a service.
- Okay, what is that service?

16:03.863 --> 16:06.365
Can we be looking on that?

16:06.365 --> 16:09.368
They should talk to him.
They should speak to him.

16:09.368 --> 16:10.745
What did he say?

16:11.203 --> 16:14.081
Frank thinks you should speak
to your dad.

16:14.081 --> 16:16.626
I can hold the phone near him
if you like.

16:16.626 --> 16:18.919
Why does Frank think that, Tom?

16:18.919 --> 16:24.633
I guess if it's a chance to, you know,
I think it's the last chance.

16:25.301 --> 16:28.388
- What the fuck do you mean, Tom?
- He's not in good shape, Roman.

16:28.388 --> 16:31.390
They're doing chest compressions.

16:31.390 --> 16:32.892
Well, should they be doing that?

16:32.892 --> 16:35.227
They're getting good advice
and they're good people.

16:35.227 --> 16:38.188
But I think you should talk to him.
I'm not sure he's breathing.

16:38.689 --> 16:42.526
- Are you serious right now, Frank?
- We just heard that he was breathing.

16:42.526 --> 16:44.905
You shouldn't do CPR to someone
whose heart is going, Frank.

16:44.905 --> 16:47.115
What the fuck is going on?

16:47.115 --> 16:51.036
I'm gonna take you to him and
I'm gonna put you by his ear.

16:52.411 --> 16:53.704
Okay, he'll be able to hear you.

16:53.704 --> 16:57.042
If he can hear,
he'll be able to hear you.

16:57.667 --> 17:02.088
- You might wanna get...
- We'll get Shiv.

17:02.838 --> 17:05.549
Okay, I'm putting you by his ear now.

17:05.549 --> 17:07.969
Can he hear me?
Is he okay?

17:07.969 --> 17:10.430
- Tom, is he okay?
- No, Rome, he's not okay.

17:10.430 --> 17:13.807
But you can speak into his ear
right now. Go ahead.

17:23.150 --> 17:28.405
Hey, Dad!
I hope you're okay.

17:29.823 --> 17:32.494
You're okay.
You're going to be okay.

17:32.494 --> 17:35.747
Because you're a monster
and you're gonna win.

17:35.747 --> 17:40.751
'Cause you just win
and you're a good man,

17:40.751 --> 17:44.506
you're a good dad.
You're a very good dad.

17:46.549 --> 17:47.967
You did a good job.

17:48.385 --> 17:52.722
No, I'm sorry,
I don't know how to do that. Your turn.

17:52.722 --> 17:54.140
- Am I by his ear?
- Yeah.

17:54.140 --> 17:57.227
You're by his ear.
If he can hear it, he can hear you.

17:57.227 --> 17:58.644
- Go ahead.
- Okay.

18:01.021 --> 18:02.815
Hang in there.

18:03.816 --> 18:05.026
Yeah?

18:07.778 --> 18:10.031
- It'll be okay.
- It'll be okay.

18:10.490 --> 18:13.284
We love you, dad. Okay?
We love you.

18:14.369 --> 18:15.536
I love you, dad.

18:17.204 --> 18:19.248
I do, I love you. Okay?

18:21.333 --> 18:22.544
And it's okay.

18:25.880 --> 18:30.217
Even though you fucking...
I don't know.

18:30.802 --> 18:33.095
I can't forgive you.

18:37.142 --> 18:38.517
But...

18:40.770 --> 18:45.442
But it's okay.

18:48.402 --> 18:51.780
And I love you.

18:58.370 --> 19:00.248
- Tom...
- Is Siobhan there?

19:01.666 --> 19:05.503
- Ken's gonna get Shiv.
- She's not here, I don't think.

19:06.378 --> 19:10.049
- Ken's gonna get Shiv.
- I'm gonna get Shiv.

19:46.877 --> 19:49.922
Crazy.
Thanks for making me do that.

19:51.006 --> 19:53.300
- Sorry.
- Shiv...

19:53.884 --> 19:56.388
- Mom?
- Dad is in trouble.

19:56.762 --> 20:01.141
- What? What's happened?
- He's on a plane. And he...

20:03.103 --> 20:06.022
It's bad.
And they're doing chest compressions.

20:06.022 --> 20:07.481
What?

20:08.066 --> 20:09.651
What, Ken?

20:14.488 --> 20:19.494
I don't know everything.
He's with Tom and Frank and Karl.

20:19.910 --> 20:21.580
And they're on the line to doctors.

20:21.580 --> 20:24.541
And I don't know,
he was in the bathroom.

20:24.541 --> 20:28.128
And he had trouble breathing.
Like, I don't know.

20:28.128 --> 20:31.422
And they started doing
chest compressions.

20:31.422 --> 20:33.675
And he was still breathing
a minute ago.

20:33.675 --> 20:35.218
But it's very bad.

20:36.093 --> 20:41.433
So, Shiv's coming.
They think he's gone.

20:41.766 --> 20:44.811
- What do you mean?
- They think dad died.

20:44.811 --> 20:47.271
What? No!

20:48.481 --> 20:50.399
- I'm sorry.
- No!

20:50.399 --> 20:52.360
No, I can't have that.

20:53.236 --> 20:56.655
Hey, hey, Tom, can she do it?
Can Shiv speak to him?

20:56.655 --> 20:59.159
They've been putting this
to Dad's ear just to speak to him.

20:59.533 --> 21:00.909
I'm giving you to Shiv.

21:01.995 --> 21:04.706
Hey, Shiv, I'm putting you by his ear.

21:04.706 --> 21:08.043
Okay. Is he still hearing?

21:09.085 --> 21:11.253
I don't know,
but I'm putting you there, okay?

21:11.253 --> 21:14.632
You're by his ear. You can go now.
You're talking to him now.

21:15.300 --> 21:18.594
Okay. Hey, Dad.

21:19.345 --> 21:22.806
Hello. You're gonna be okay.

21:23.350 --> 21:26.101
I'm sorry. Is he dead?

21:26.101 --> 21:28.688
I don't know if he's dead.
Is he fucking dead?

21:30.272 --> 21:32.817
Tom? Tom?

21:33.860 --> 21:35.362
Hey.

21:37.280 --> 21:40.075
- Is he even alive?
- I don't know, honey.

21:41.784 --> 21:45.120
Are you just being nice to me?
Is he gone?

21:45.120 --> 21:47.581
I don't know.

21:48.540 --> 21:50.167
We don't know.

21:52.629 --> 21:55.006
Okay, I'm putting you back there, okay?

21:57.842 --> 22:03.306
Okay.
Well, I don't know what to do.

22:03.306 --> 22:04.849
You're by his ear.

22:06.101 --> 22:09.937
Just go somewhere private.
Just speak.

22:09.937 --> 22:12.773
It's weird, but speak, okay?
You never know. He might hear you.

22:12.773 --> 22:15.235
Dad? Hey.

22:16.944 --> 22:19.489
Dad? Daddy?

22:20.532 --> 22:22.408
I love you.

22:24.535 --> 22:26.912
Don't go, please. Not now.

22:28.039 --> 22:32.418
No... I love you. You fucking...

22:33.795 --> 22:37.924
God! There's no excuses for being...

22:37.924 --> 22:39.801
But I...

22:42.345 --> 22:43.471
Fuck!

22:44.472 --> 22:47.309
I don't know. I do love you.

22:47.309 --> 22:51.687
And it's okay.
It's okay, Daddy.

22:52.688 --> 22:55.274
It's okay. I love you.

23:00.614 --> 23:02.198
You want to stay on?

23:14.376 --> 23:15.962
Tom?

23:15.962 --> 23:17.713
- Hey, Roman.
- What's happening?

23:17.713 --> 23:21.634
Tell me precisely what
is happening right now.

23:21.634 --> 23:22.844
Okay.

23:23.761 --> 23:28.432
So we're all here, and I'm heading
to the back of the plane.

23:31.018 --> 23:33.521
He's at the front, on the floor,

23:33.521 --> 23:35.481
and they're doing
chest compressions.

23:35.481 --> 23:37.943
Okay, so they're still
doing chest compressions?

23:37.943 --> 23:39.401
Yeah, yeah, they are.

23:39.401 --> 23:41.821
But not because...
I think they have to.

23:41.821 --> 23:43.406
I think they have
to keep doing that.

23:43.406 --> 23:46.785
And the plane people are lovely,
and they're good people.

23:46.785 --> 23:49.871
I think they've made him
very comfortable.

23:51.121 --> 23:53.500
Is he gone?

23:53.500 --> 23:55.209
Is he...

23:55.877 --> 23:57.378
Is he okay at all?

23:57.836 --> 24:00.882
He's not okay. No. He's not.

24:02.841 --> 24:05.512
Is he gone? Tom?

24:07.055 --> 24:11.017
They say his heart has stopped,
and his breathing has stopped.

24:11.017 --> 24:12.352
For a while, maybe.

24:13.769 --> 24:16.939
Okay, but that doesn't mean
that he's dead, medically.

24:16.939 --> 24:18.275
Right?

24:18.983 --> 24:21.860
I don't know. They're still doing
the chest compressions.

24:21.860 --> 24:23.988
And when do you land?

24:23.988 --> 24:26.116
Have you turned around?
You're coming back?

24:26.532 --> 24:28.285
I think, yes,

24:28.285 --> 24:31.371
we're heading back, I think.

24:32.205 --> 24:34.249
Can you put me through
to the flight deck?

24:35.000 --> 24:37.669
Can I speak with the pilot, please, Tom?

24:38.461 --> 24:42.131
I'll call Frank's phone, and he can
take me through to the flight deck.

24:42.131 --> 24:44.508
Okay, Frank,
Kendall's gonna call your phone

24:44.508 --> 24:46.761
and be taken through to the pilot.

24:47.136 --> 24:49.179
Okay, that's happening.

24:49.179 --> 24:52.225
Jess, I need a few things.
My dad's dying.

24:53.600 --> 24:55.312
I'm just gonna do facts, okay?

24:55.312 --> 24:58.605
I need my doctor.
Do they have his doctor?

24:58.605 --> 25:01.525
Do you have his doctor on the line?

25:01.525 --> 25:05.822
Do we have his doctor on the...
We have their service,

25:05.822 --> 25:07.781
their medical service,
which they have,

25:07.781 --> 25:09.951
and we have Karl's guy listening in.

25:09.951 --> 25:12.746
- But we couldn't get ahold of him.
- No, no, they don't have...

25:12.746 --> 25:15.748
And dad's doctor,
Dr. fucking Judith.

25:15.748 --> 25:18.043
Get that lazy fucking bastard

25:18.043 --> 25:21.379
and get him and get the best heart
doctor in the world

25:21.379 --> 25:23.548
and the best airplane medicine expert
in the world

25:23.548 --> 25:25.383
and get them conferenced in
and waiting

25:25.383 --> 25:27.886
and send a conference call number
to me and to Tom

25:27.886 --> 25:29.094
and to Karl's phone.

25:29.094 --> 25:32.431
I would like that in the next minute,
two minutes, please, Jess.

25:32.431 --> 25:34.099
Okay?

25:44.361 --> 25:45.403
Hey, Ken.

25:45.403 --> 25:47.989
Can I speak to the pilot?
Can you put me through to the pilot?

25:48.656 --> 25:51.159
The pilot can't speak to you
right now, Ken.

25:51.910 --> 25:53.995
Yes, he can.

25:55.704 --> 25:58.625
He's flying the plane, son.

26:00.918 --> 26:03.295
Okay, what's happening?

26:03.295 --> 26:07.132
Frank, where's the information?

26:07.675 --> 26:11.637
We're turning the plane around.
We're coming back to Teterboro.

26:12.555 --> 26:13.722
Okay.

26:14.266 --> 26:21.188
Just fucking tell them
to do it right.

26:21.898 --> 26:24.400
- Okay?
- I will.

26:24.942 --> 26:26.443
I'm sorry, Ken.

26:26.986 --> 26:28.779
Yeah.

26:31.324 --> 26:32.741
Is he gone?

26:33.660 --> 26:37.497
Frank, I mean, is he gone?

26:39.248 --> 26:44.962
I don't know. He got very short
of breath and he was hurting

26:44.962 --> 26:46.923
and then very bad...

26:47.298 --> 26:48.924
I don't want to bullshit you, Ken.

26:50.175 --> 26:52.887
I think he went. I think he's gone.

26:55.347 --> 26:56.516
Okay.

26:59.185 --> 27:01.353
Thank you, Frank. Thank you.

27:34.638 --> 27:36.473
Frank thinks he's gone.

27:42.938 --> 27:44.773
Why didn't you come and get me?

27:44.773 --> 27:46.774
I did, Shiv, we did.

27:46.774 --> 27:53.030
I was right out there.
How long was it happening before?

27:53.030 --> 27:54.950
- I'm sorry. I wasn't...
- No, no, no.

27:54.950 --> 27:57.619
There was like no time.

27:57.619 --> 28:01.665
- I wasn't thinking. I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

28:02.499 --> 28:04.249
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

28:06.251 --> 28:09.880
Tom said that Kerry spoke to him
quite a bit.

28:10.255 --> 28:12.425
Right. Well, I don't know.

28:13.092 --> 28:15.595
I mean, we don't know
if he could hear us.

28:18.305 --> 28:21.226
Yeah, just I'm sad, I guess.

28:23.603 --> 28:27.232
Do we know if he was on his phone,
if he checked his messages?

28:30.317 --> 28:32.653
- Rome, it's okay.
- Yeah, I know.

28:32.653 --> 28:34.864
- We're okay.
- I don't know. I just don't know.

28:34.864 --> 28:36.950
You did good.

28:36.950 --> 28:40.245
I feel like I didn't...
Did I say I loved him?

28:41.580 --> 28:43.789
- I think so, yeah.
- I'm pretty sure I didn't.

28:43.789 --> 28:46.501
- No, I think you did.
- No, I don't think so.

28:46.501 --> 28:51.464
Tom, could you put me back
to his ear for... Fuck it, never mind.

28:51.464 --> 28:55.176
Never mind, I don't know.
Maybe let's just keep the line open.

28:55.176 --> 28:57.554
I'll tell you if anything happens.

29:00.599 --> 29:03.434
Fuck! We need to get Connor.
We need to tell him.

29:04.811 --> 29:08.398
Can you do it, Ken?
I don't think I can. I mean, I could.

29:08.398 --> 29:10.649
I definitely could. I just...

29:11.651 --> 29:12.818
Thank you.

29:13.527 --> 29:15.321
- It's okay.
- Do you want me to...

29:15.321 --> 29:21.453
Yeah? Yeah...

29:41.097 --> 29:42.849
Hey, hey.
It's my brother and sister.

29:42.849 --> 29:47.062
- Fucking cake nightmare, okay?
- Con.

29:47.645 --> 29:50.690
- What is it?
- Come here.

29:50.690 --> 29:52.567
- What is it?
- It's private.

29:52.567 --> 29:55.362
- It's serious. Come here.
- Five. Okay.

29:56.236 --> 29:58.782
- Come here, buddy.
- What is it? Is it important?

29:58.782 --> 30:00.033
- Come here for a sec.
- What?

30:01.742 --> 30:04.370
Is it pop? Is he okay?

30:05.872 --> 30:07.456
What is it? Is he sick? What is it?

30:07.456 --> 30:10.584
Dad's on an airplane to Sweden,
but they're coming back.

30:11.460 --> 30:12.753
We think he died.

30:13.462 --> 30:16.423
They think he's dead.

30:18.885 --> 30:20.219
Well, is he?

30:21.095 --> 30:23.889
Well, everyone says he is.

30:24.808 --> 30:28.310
We don't know.
They're doing heart compressions.

30:29.895 --> 30:31.230
Oh, man!

30:32.440 --> 30:33.816
He never even liked me.

30:35.150 --> 30:37.362
- Hey, Con.
- Hey, sorry. You know what?

30:37.362 --> 30:40.114
I'm sorry.
I don't even know what I mean.

30:40.114 --> 30:44.953
He did. I never got the chance
to make him proud of me.

30:45.577 --> 30:46.662
He's dead.

30:47.497 --> 30:50.291
- Roman is on the phone to the plane.
- Jesus.

30:50.291 --> 30:55.212
- If you want to talk to him...
- I don't know. I don't know.

30:55.212 --> 30:58.590
- Anything?
- I can't do this. I can't.

30:58.590 --> 31:00.426
I can't do this, okay?

31:11.312 --> 31:12.688
Hi.

31:14.149 --> 31:15.609
Thank you.

31:22.531 --> 31:23.866
What happened?

31:25.118 --> 31:28.121
- What happened?
- I'm sorry, man. I'm sorry.

31:29.830 --> 31:32.166
He was on the plane, and...

31:33.960 --> 31:36.962
He got short of breath.

31:36.962 --> 31:41.009
I said, "Hello, fucky-sucky brigade",
and he was in the bathroom.

31:41.009 --> 31:43.719
- He was in the bathroom?
- Yeah, I don't know.

31:43.719 --> 31:45.804
- He was in trouble, I guess.
- What was it?

31:46.389 --> 31:51.102
Well, we don't actually know.
We don't know he's gone.

31:52.103 --> 31:55.857
Okay, so he was in the airplane toilet...

31:55.857 --> 31:58.693
- Come on.
- Can we please get this straight?

31:58.693 --> 32:00.903
How about we just get some doctors
in there,

32:00.903 --> 32:02.947
some proper doctors, and then
we'll know what actually happened?

32:02.947 --> 32:08.661
Sure. I mean, he has gone.
I think he has died.

32:08.661 --> 32:10.664
Okay, but you don't know that.

32:10.664 --> 32:14.000
Sure, I get it, but, like,
I think they know.

32:14.000 --> 32:16.419
Okay, okay, maybe.
Maybe is all.

32:16.419 --> 32:18.505
Roman, I think you have to accept...

32:18.505 --> 32:20.298
Okay, I'm not, like, saying anything.

32:20.298 --> 32:22.257
All I'm saying is that we actually
don't know.

32:22.257 --> 32:23.842
That's it. That's all I'm saying.

32:23.842 --> 32:26.178
Right, well, yes,
but you sound delusional.

32:26.178 --> 32:29.224
What am I, out fucking voted here?

32:29.224 --> 32:33.435
No, Rome, I'm just saying...
Come on, you know...

32:33.435 --> 32:35.854
- What?
- They know.

32:35.854 --> 32:37.232
No, no they don't.

32:37.232 --> 32:38.941
- He's...
- No.

32:38.941 --> 32:40.985
He's fucking dead.

32:40.985 --> 32:43.112
There's no need
to fucking say that, right?

32:43.112 --> 32:46.991
What's the point of keep on saying it?
All I'm saying, I'm not being crazy.

32:46.991 --> 32:48.952
I'm saying a fact.
I'm saying we don't know.

32:48.952 --> 32:51.913
And until we do know, it's not
a very nice thing to say, is it?

32:51.913 --> 32:53.957
- Okay.
- So fucking stop!

32:55.208 --> 32:57.085
- Okay.
- Okay.

33:00.379 --> 33:04.300
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

33:26.031 --> 33:30.201
Well, I'm gonna have
a little stiffener here.

33:30.201 --> 33:33.788
Just, gents, Karolina, pardon me.

33:36.874 --> 33:38.043
Let's drink to him.

33:40.502 --> 33:42.172
Well, I guess we're off the clock.

33:42.172 --> 33:47.344
I think it might be smart for us
to start putting together a timeline.

33:48.344 --> 33:51.306
And also, I've been
drawing up, just in case,

33:51.306 --> 33:54.767
you know, if we need to,
a contact list.

33:54.767 --> 33:59.606
Oh, God, they're still pumping
on him back there, Karolina.

33:59.606 --> 34:02.817
Well, I'm not happy about it, Karl.
And I think we're all being respectful.

34:02.817 --> 34:06.613
But this is gonna be a very
complicated situation to handle.

34:06.613 --> 34:08.614
So, you know, if we get
a miracle, we get a miracle.

34:08.614 --> 34:11.200
God bless us all.
If we don't, I just have to prepare.

34:11.200 --> 34:13.745
- That's all.
- Absolutely. Go, go.

34:13.745 --> 34:16.705
Okay, so I think we should
call Matsson and let him know.

34:17.706 --> 34:21.919
Well, then we should at least call him
and tell him that he's delayed.

34:21.919 --> 34:23.796
He's heavily fucking delayed.

34:23.796 --> 34:26.216
And then, in no particular order,

34:26.216 --> 34:30.971
not in this order anyway,
the board, Gerri, POTUS.

34:32.764 --> 34:34.682
- Hey, how are you?
- Hi!

34:36.225 --> 34:40.313
That's fucking... nuts.

34:40.313 --> 34:42.773
- That was fucking crazy, right?
- Yeah.

34:44.276 --> 34:47.362
It is. We're in shock.

34:49.447 --> 34:53.326
That's so fucking weird. Jesus.

34:53.868 --> 34:56.829
- You guys okay?
- Yeah, we're good.

34:58.914 --> 35:00.457
- Kerry...
- Yeah.

35:01.750 --> 35:04.920
If it's all right with you, we're just
using this space to coordinate

35:04.920 --> 35:08.758
a response if we need to send out.

35:08.758 --> 35:11.845
Is that okay if we...

35:12.345 --> 35:14.596
Yeah.

35:14.596 --> 35:18.059
- Do you want me to help?
- No, no.

35:18.059 --> 35:20.894
That's so kind, but you're in shock.

35:20.894 --> 35:24.065
I think you should go back there and
we'll make you comfortable

35:24.065 --> 35:26.443
and we'll bring you whatever you need.

35:27.193 --> 35:32.657
Okay, so do you want me
to be a part of that,

35:32.657 --> 35:34.326
of the response and the...

35:34.326 --> 35:35.827
That'd be great, Kerry.

35:35.827 --> 35:38.496
Why don't you rest up in there,

35:38.496 --> 35:41.665
let us get our ducks in a row,
and we'll get your input.

35:41.665 --> 35:45.545
Okay. I'm gonna be back here. There.

35:51.175 --> 35:53.802
- What the fuck?
- I think she's freaking out, Tom.

35:53.802 --> 35:55.472
Yeah?

35:55.472 --> 35:59.475
It looks like she caught a foul ball
at Yankee Stadium.

35:59.475 --> 36:02.395
- Jesus.
- Here is the list of names.

36:02.395 --> 36:06.399
I think we divide up
as soon as we get the...

36:06.399 --> 36:11.904
Not the all clear, but once those
30 minutes are up...

36:11.904 --> 36:15.367
I think we should
get Kerry to do them.

36:15.367 --> 36:16.993
Now you want Kerry to do them?

36:16.993 --> 36:19.537
Chuckles the Clown?
I think not.

36:34.761 --> 36:38.097
Wait. Hold that thought.

36:38.097 --> 36:39.682
- Hey, Tom.
- Hey, Greg.

36:39.682 --> 36:43.103
So I might need you
to whiz into the office.

36:44.187 --> 36:46.897
It's a wedding day, Tom.
Why?

36:46.897 --> 36:50.318
Why? Because Logan is dead.

36:52.653 --> 36:55.073
Uncle Logan, really?

36:56.575 --> 36:59.034
- How... What...
- So listen to me.

36:59.034 --> 37:02.663
You have to stick to Cyd
like a limpet, okay?

37:03.205 --> 37:06.376
And you delete my folder
marked "logistics"

37:06.376 --> 37:08.128
and then you delete
that from the trash.

37:08.128 --> 37:10.963
And I might need you calling
around with my narrative.

37:10.963 --> 37:13.924
You sing my song.
Merry Christmas, Greg.

37:13.924 --> 37:15.427
What?
What do you mean?

37:15.427 --> 37:17.678
Well, he's passed away,
and you've looked out.

37:17.678 --> 37:21.016
What's at the bottom of your stocking,
Greg?

37:21.765 --> 37:24.059
An old guy who fucking hated you.

37:24.603 --> 37:25.978
Tom, man.

37:26.896 --> 37:29.648
- Easy, dude.
- I'm sorry.

37:29.983 --> 37:31.775
Are you okay? Jesus.

37:31.775 --> 37:33.819
I'm not okay.

37:36.072 --> 37:39.116
I'm sad.
But I'm sorry.

37:39.951 --> 37:41.494
But, fuck.

37:44.456 --> 37:46.457
I don't know.
It was pretty grim, man.

37:46.457 --> 37:48.876
Yeah, it's a horrible...

37:48.876 --> 37:51.254
I lost my protector.

37:51.755 --> 37:55.799
And this is total lockdown.
Okay, Greg?

37:55.799 --> 37:57.052
Total lockdown.

37:57.052 --> 37:59.763
If this leaks,
it's a stock price rodeo

37:59.763 --> 38:02.473
and a fucking slit throat
for the big mouth, okay?

38:02.473 --> 38:07.269
Okay, but people should know
that I was with him.

38:07.979 --> 38:11.357
Okay? Okay, man.
Okay, bye.

38:26.413 --> 38:28.707
- Everything all right?
- Yeah, yeah, fine.

38:29.793 --> 38:31.503
Do you think your
uncle's gonna make it?

38:31.503 --> 38:32.711
Do I what?

38:32.711 --> 38:35.464
Sorry, is your uncle gonna
make it to the wedding?

38:40.345 --> 38:41.553
Hey, guys.

38:42.347 --> 38:45.265
What?
Have you heard already or... ?

38:45.265 --> 38:47.560
Yeah, well, the folks
on the plane thought

38:47.560 --> 38:51.021
it would be a good idea for me to act
as a liaison with you guys.

38:51.021 --> 38:53.524
I am so, so sorry for your loss.

38:53.524 --> 38:55.067
But we don't know shit.

38:55.067 --> 38:57.152
- They're still working on him.
- Right, absolutely.

38:57.152 --> 39:00.073
What if this is a drill?
What if it's a big fucking test?

39:00.073 --> 39:01.825
- We don't know.
- No.

39:01.825 --> 39:05.661
If it was a test, I'd say hats
off to the planning department.

39:05.661 --> 39:09.499
It does not feel likely that he's,
you know...

39:11.042 --> 39:13.377
You guys want me to wait outside?

39:21.844 --> 39:23.096
Hey, Tom.

39:31.603 --> 39:34.566
Fine. Okay, thank you.

39:36.192 --> 39:39.696
- They stopped the CPR.
- I don't think they should, though.

39:42.324 --> 39:44.742
Hugo, Karolina wants you.

39:45.619 --> 39:48.996
Hey, Kay. I mean, all good.

39:48.996 --> 39:51.957
Under the circumstances, yeah.

39:58.714 --> 40:00.966
- Are we going?
- What the fuck?

40:01.342 --> 40:04.220
- No, no, I get it.
- I think so.

40:04.220 --> 40:06.473
- We'll discuss it.
- Yeah, I think we're going.

40:06.473 --> 40:08.140
- No.
- Where are we going?

40:08.140 --> 40:10.225
- I gotta go.
- Hugo.

40:10.644 --> 40:12.936
Can you find out
what the fuck's going on?

40:12.936 --> 40:14.521
Yes, I will.

40:14.521 --> 40:19.861
And for your information,
they're starting to draft a statement.

40:22.030 --> 40:23.197
How do you mean?

40:25.116 --> 40:30.621
Karolina and Frank and Karl and Tom
are putting something together

40:30.621 --> 40:34.000
for when we're ready to release
the news.

40:35.543 --> 40:38.546
- They're on the statement?
- Who asked them to?

40:38.546 --> 40:40.589
I don't know, but they're doing it.

40:40.589 --> 40:42.884
- That feels...
- Yeah, that feels...

40:42.884 --> 40:44.511
- Right?
- Yeah.

40:45.719 --> 40:47.763
Hey, Hugo, can you fuck off
and find out

40:47.763 --> 40:50.267
what the fuck's going on with
this boat? We want to go back.

40:50.849 --> 40:52.811
- Yeah, fuck out.
- I'm on it.

40:58.190 --> 41:00.818
Yeah, hi, folks!
You're on speaker now.

41:00.818 --> 41:02.612
Hey.

41:03.780 --> 41:07.074
So, listen, what's going on
with this statement?

41:07.867 --> 41:12.122
Yeah, so we're just starting to put
the bones together

41:12.122 --> 41:14.583
for when we're going
to announce this.

41:16.209 --> 41:17.918
Sorry for your loss.

41:18.753 --> 41:22.591
Okay, well, it feels pretty
fucking presumptuous.

41:24.009 --> 41:27.596
Well, sorry that's how it seemed,
but regardless

41:27.596 --> 41:31.140
of our personal feeling of loss in terms
of a business position,

41:31.140 --> 41:33.267
it is a material event.

41:34.310 --> 41:39.065
We just need the board
to reassure the market.

41:39.065 --> 41:42.026
Will someone please think
of the market.

41:42.443 --> 41:44.404
I'm trying to do my job.

41:44.404 --> 41:47.032
He's like 12 feet away,
and I've known him for 40 years.

41:47.032 --> 41:48.907
We're not pulling anything here.

41:48.907 --> 41:51.827
We just thought that since
you were estranged,

41:51.827 --> 41:55.290
we thought that you might
want us to be in the hub on this.

41:55.290 --> 41:58.919
We're not estranged.
We weren't estranged.

41:58.919 --> 42:02.421
All right, Kendall, no,
I just simply meant...

42:02.421 --> 42:04.548
We had all kinds of communications
with him.

42:04.548 --> 42:06.008
We had a family function

42:06.008 --> 42:11.305
last night, in fact. Estranged
is a strong word and not accurate.

42:11.680 --> 42:14.017
Fine. All good.
We got it.

42:16.435 --> 42:19.438
Let's stay close and best to you guys.

42:19.438 --> 42:20.815
Good strength, friends.

42:25.153 --> 42:29.573
I think, you know, they're
very much still processing.

42:41.502 --> 42:42.920
Fucking great.

42:44.088 --> 42:45.631
Shit.

42:46.508 --> 42:47.926
Hey.

42:49.052 --> 42:50.553
How are you all doing?

42:51.054 --> 42:53.139
I briefed her.

42:53.847 --> 42:56.016
I'm really sorry.

42:57.726 --> 42:59.186
I'm very sorry.

43:00.897 --> 43:06.695
He was an important man
in all our lives, but especially yours.

43:07.362 --> 43:09.364
Thanks, Ger, I'm welling up.

43:09.364 --> 43:14.536
I mean, he was a lot of things,
but yeah...

43:16.996 --> 43:19.456
Well, we don't know
yet that he's dead, okay?

43:19.456 --> 43:21.960
No doctor has actually seen him.

43:24.379 --> 43:30.384
Gerri, in terms of the breathing
space, we have a bit of time to think,

43:30.384 --> 43:33.178
right, until they land?

43:33.178 --> 43:37.725
Are you thinking can we hold this
information until the markets close?

43:38.309 --> 43:42.689
Because obviously this
is a very significant private thing.

43:42.689 --> 43:44.606
Is it? Is it significant?

43:44.606 --> 43:47.026
But it's also a big thing in terms
of the public,

43:47.651 --> 43:49.194
in terms of the company.

43:49.194 --> 43:52.281
I honestly don't know how
much I can get into this.

43:52.865 --> 43:54.366
How long until they land?

43:54.950 --> 43:56.661
I will check.

43:57.329 --> 44:00.623
Gerri, we can't think straight.

44:00.623 --> 44:03.168
Can we keep it up there
for an extra beat?

44:03.168 --> 44:06.420
- While we gather and...
- The fucking plane?

44:06.420 --> 44:11.592
- Yeah, I'm not ready to...
- We need to get him on the ground.

44:11.592 --> 44:14.638
We need to get a fucking
doctor on that plane.

44:14.638 --> 44:16.097
God, I've got a headache.

44:17.140 --> 44:21.560
Look, I think it's really good
for you guys to stay across this.

44:22.270 --> 44:26.066
Do you want me to ask
if they can circle?

44:26.566 --> 44:28.859
- No.
- Karolina.

44:28.859 --> 44:33.447
Not until the markets open on Monday,
but just, you know, so we can think.

44:33.447 --> 44:37.284
- Absolutely not.
- Can you get me an Advil, Hugo?

44:37.284 --> 44:40.204
And can we get back to fucking land?

44:41.288 --> 44:42.498
We want to go to him, yeah?

44:42.498 --> 44:44.416
Thanks for getting Gerri,
but back to land.

44:44.416 --> 44:46.043
Do your job, thanks.

44:58.514 --> 45:01.266
Look, this is very surreal.

45:02.894 --> 45:08.357
Just to say, every single thing
we say and do today

45:09.317 --> 45:11.193
is going in the memoirs,

45:11.193 --> 45:13.612
going in the fucking congressional record,

45:13.612 --> 45:16.740
it's coming up at board meetings,
it's going in SEC filings.

45:18.201 --> 45:20.953
We tell them to circle for half an
hour so we can get our heads straight,

45:20.953 --> 45:25.292
and then some fucking rumor starts
we get crucified for being cold-hearted,

45:25.292 --> 45:26.667
or I don't even know.

45:27.126 --> 45:29.295
We are highly liable
to misinterpretation.

45:30.714 --> 45:35.467
So what we do today will always be
what we did the day our father died.

45:38.304 --> 45:42.684
So let's grieve and whatever,

45:45.519 --> 45:49.148
but not do anything that restricts
our future freedom of movement.

45:52.234 --> 45:55.614
What do you think?
It's cancel, yeah?

45:56.740 --> 46:01.286
- I think it is cancel.
- What do we tell them?

46:03.997 --> 46:09.043
I mean, everyone will assume that
it's you backing out, and that's fine.

46:10.712 --> 46:15.841
Or could something good
come out of something bad.

46:19.928 --> 46:23.015
Too weird, right? Or is it?

46:23.015 --> 46:26.685
Oh, Con. Con, it feels like
you kind of want to do it.

46:27.020 --> 46:29.022
I don't know, I don't.

46:29.022 --> 46:34.319
I guess the truth is, I'm scared
if we don't,

46:36.153 --> 46:38.907
that you'll walk away.

46:39.366 --> 46:41.576
I'm always scared
you're gonna walk away.

46:41.576 --> 46:43.786
I'm so much older than you, Willa.

46:44.411 --> 46:48.666
You're young, and you're full of life,
and I'm...

46:50.542 --> 46:52.045
I don't know.

46:53.421 --> 46:55.839
My father's dead, and I feel old.

46:56.840 --> 46:58.550
It's okay.

46:58.550 --> 47:03.556
And I'm sorry, I don't know, that
I stole you away from the world.

47:03.556 --> 47:05.891
Oh, God, Con. No.

47:07.102 --> 47:09.436
Are you just with me for money, Willa?

47:11.314 --> 47:12.982
Basically.

47:16.151 --> 47:21.991
Well, I mean, there is something
about money and safety here, yeah.

47:21.991 --> 47:23.868
Yeah, yeah, there is.

47:25.453 --> 47:28.456
But I'm happy.

47:30.165 --> 47:33.128
- I am.
- You okay? It's okay?

47:33.795 --> 47:35.338
I'm not gonna walk.

47:37.882 --> 47:42.177
Not today, anyway.
I'm sorry.

47:44.222 --> 47:46.557
What was that like when he told you?

47:50.185 --> 47:54.024
I thought I knew, and actually
I thought it was Dad,

47:54.024 --> 47:56.109
but I said Mom, right?

47:56.109 --> 47:58.194
Yeah, you asked if it was Mom.

47:58.194 --> 48:02.573
I was thinking Dad,
but I sort of think I...

48:04.534 --> 48:07.328
I think I was hoping it was Mom.

48:07.328 --> 48:10.165
- Jesus.
- Shit.

48:10.914 --> 48:13.877
The fucking lists, the everything.

48:14.543 --> 48:15.962
I don't know if I can do it.

48:16.546 --> 48:19.715
You don't have to do anything.
Our dad just died.

48:22.301 --> 48:25.095
We'll be okay.
We'll get people.

48:26.096 --> 48:28.057
We'll get a funeral off the rack.

48:29.434 --> 48:31.894
We could do Reagan's with tweaks.

48:33.104 --> 48:34.396
I have Karolina.

48:36.149 --> 48:37.859
So, Karolina,
I'm with the kids now,

48:37.859 --> 48:40.110
and I'm gonna put you on
speakerphone, okay?

48:40.987 --> 48:43.949
Karolina, you're on speakerphone.

48:43.949 --> 48:45.116
Hey, hi.

48:45.116 --> 48:48.203
So, I just got a call from a reporter
who's already heard a rumor

48:48.203 --> 48:51.538
about Logan's health.

48:51.538 --> 48:53.833
- From where?
- I don't know what the source was.

48:53.833 --> 48:57.170
I just said there was nothing on that,

48:58.088 --> 48:59.922
which isn't great, but...

49:00.881 --> 49:03.426
- How?
- I don't know.

49:03.426 --> 49:04.760
Plane to ground comms,

49:05.636 --> 49:08.389
our tail number, we're turning,
they're tracking.

49:08.389 --> 49:11.475
I don't know what goes on down there.
Eavesdrop? Kerry.

49:11.475 --> 49:14.896
We probably do just need
to figure out the choreography.

49:14.896 --> 49:16.230
Yeah?

49:16.230 --> 49:18.649
You want to choreograph
some steps with my dead father,

49:18.649 --> 49:20.401
do the dance you like?

49:23.029 --> 49:25.990
- Sorry.
- That's okay.

49:25.990 --> 49:27.700
It's a difficult day.

49:27.700 --> 49:31.245
We're gonna need the statement.
Do you guys want to do it?

49:31.245 --> 49:33.623
Do you want us to do it?

49:33.623 --> 49:36.626
I know that this is tough
for you guys, I understand that.

49:36.626 --> 49:39.879
So, if you like,
we can give the word.

49:39.879 --> 49:43.841
Frank, Karl, myself, Karolina, we
could handle the immediate chowder.

49:44.426 --> 49:46.720
And if you like,
you could be excused

49:46.720 --> 49:49.097
from the board meeting
on compassionate grounds.

49:49.097 --> 49:51.933
Thanks, Gerri.
I need some air.

49:52.350 --> 49:55.437
Can you give us five
before we do anything?

49:55.437 --> 49:57.771
- Yeah, sure.
- Thanks.

50:11.161 --> 50:12.453
I don't know.

50:13.871 --> 50:18.001
I mean, I don't really want to be
the one to have to say things.

50:18.001 --> 50:21.963
I feel like you're looking at me
and, yeah, but...

50:21.963 --> 50:24.716
It's okay, Ken.

50:26.383 --> 50:31.722
It's okay.
I don't think anything of it.

50:31.722 --> 50:35.185
- You can say.
- Okay, I mean, just, who knows?

50:35.185 --> 50:38.395
Maybe, tomorrow,
we hand them the crown.

50:38.395 --> 50:40.231
Probably a good idea.
Finish the sale.

50:40.231 --> 50:42.107
Great, but just...

50:42.901 --> 50:45.361
Should we keep our options open?

50:47.155 --> 50:49.199
One second, Hugo.

50:51.743 --> 50:57.164
Yeah, I just don't know that I can
literally do anything or talk to anyone.

50:58.625 --> 51:01.418
We need to be on the statement,
though, Rome.

51:01.418 --> 51:06.341
Otherwise it could be all Frank
and Karl and Gerri and...

51:07.633 --> 51:09.094
You know, even just overnight,

51:09.094 --> 51:11.887
whatever the text is,
the subtext has to be...

51:13.013 --> 51:16.058
... Logan Roy, you know,
but Roman Roy

51:16.058 --> 51:19.354
and Kendall Roy and Shiv Roy,
we're all here.

51:19.354 --> 51:21.730
- Yeah?
- Okay.

51:22.815 --> 51:26.860
And you just don't want
Karolina to just handle it?

51:26.860 --> 51:28.529
- It's just for the statement.
- Well, okay.

51:28.529 --> 51:34.201
It'll be for the board to decide,
but I think until then, for the markets,

51:35.828 --> 51:38.748
we need to be in control. Us.

51:38.748 --> 51:41.625
Yeah. Until the board can meet.

51:42.419 --> 51:44.838
Yeah, I mean, I would.

51:44.838 --> 51:49.092
I don't want anything happening
that we don't approve, so...

51:50.093 --> 51:53.470
Yeah.

51:56.682 --> 51:57.976
Hugo.

51:59.727 --> 52:01.312
We'll draft the statement, okay?

52:01.312 --> 52:05.817
Great, great, great.
We'll need them to sign off.

52:05.817 --> 52:09.236
It'll need to come from Frank or Simon
or the board or...

52:09.236 --> 52:11.780
Yeah, but we'll draft, okay?

52:13.490 --> 52:15.619
And who will call Matsson?

52:18.120 --> 52:19.663
I know, but...

52:21.041 --> 52:23.167
I've got to get off the phone. Sorry.

52:24.835 --> 52:26.212
- Hey.
- Hey.

52:26.837 --> 52:29.883
Yeah, I kind of need the room.

52:31.008 --> 52:32.718
Sure. Of course.

52:36.014 --> 52:39.100
I'm pretty sad.

52:43.480 --> 52:47.525
I mean, I'm actually right now
totally numb,

52:47.525 --> 52:51.071
but theoretically you would say
that I'm...

52:51.487 --> 52:53.572
Yeah, that I'm sad.

52:54.741 --> 52:57.076
- Well, the room's all yours.
- It's a fucking mess.

52:58.411 --> 52:59.621
Okay.

54:26.124 --> 54:28.543
- I don't know what to say.
- Sorry. So sorry.

54:29.335 --> 54:31.587
Man, so sorry.

54:36.009 --> 54:39.054
- How are we getting him off?
- I don't know. Jesus.

54:39.054 --> 54:40.597
I'll handle it.

54:41.264 --> 54:43.850
You've got the edits on the statement?

54:43.850 --> 54:47.603
We do feel that, for market confidence,
it's important for Karl, myself,

54:47.603 --> 54:49.439
and Gerri to be mentioned by name.

54:49.439 --> 54:51.191
Great. I'll get that out right away.

54:51.940 --> 54:54.736
And look, we got shutter bugs all
over the perimeter,

54:54.736 --> 54:58.614
and we're looking at a feeding frenzy
if we don't talk.

54:58.614 --> 55:01.158
So we're going to get
some comments

55:01.158 --> 55:04.370
from the family,
and I've primed our friendlies.

55:05.537 --> 55:08.457
The press conference is happening
in there, and the kids are already in.

55:08.457 --> 55:10.626
Go, go. Yeah.

55:46.454 --> 55:48.832
Hello! Hello everyone!

55:49.748 --> 55:51.208
Are we going to be okay?

55:53.003 --> 55:55.171
Yeah.

55:57.047 --> 55:58.341
We'll be okay.

55:59.758 --> 56:01.428
You're not going to be okay?

56:01.428 --> 56:04.055
- Well, you're not going to be okay.
- You're not going to be okay.

56:04.055 --> 56:05.640
- You're fucked.
- You're fucked.

56:05.640 --> 56:07.851
- You're totally fucked.
- You're very fucked.

56:09.227 --> 56:10.686
- Hi.
- Are you ready?

56:10.686 --> 56:12.604
- Yeah.
- Shiv? Ready?

56:14.773 --> 56:16.275
Sure?

56:30.956 --> 56:33.125
Hi. Thank you.

56:34.336 --> 56:38.924
As you know, my father, Logan Roy,
was pronounced dead on arrival

56:38.924 --> 56:41.593
at Teterboro Airport this afternoon.

56:41.593 --> 56:45.305
I'd like to thank the press
for their respect at this time.

56:45.305 --> 56:48.308
You'll understand that I won't
be taking any questions,

56:49.099 --> 56:53.521
but my brothers and I just want
to say that Logan Roy built

56:53.521 --> 56:55.981
a great American family company.

56:55.981 --> 57:00.069
And as you know, the board
will be convening in the next hours

57:00.069 --> 57:02.906
to decide on the leadership
of the company going forward.

57:04.491 --> 57:09.204
This nation has lost a passionate
champion and an American titan,

57:09.204 --> 57:11.831
and we lost a beloved father.
Thank you.

57:12.332 --> 57:15.001
And in terms of your roles
at the company?

57:15.001 --> 57:19.089
We intend to shepherd it through

57:19.089 --> 57:22.217
whatever its future may be,
but we'll be there.

57:23.592 --> 57:26.178
Guys, guys, thank you.
No more questions.

57:26.178 --> 57:30.349
Guys, no more questions.
No more questions, please.

57:30.349 --> 57:32.727
Respect their privacy.

57:59.379 --> 58:00.504
Hey.

58:01.171 --> 58:05.384
There he is.
That is Dad.

58:08.054 --> 58:09.930
Okay, so we gonna go see him?

58:12.474 --> 58:13.810
Do you want to?

58:14.311 --> 58:15.602
Shouldn't we?

58:16.438 --> 58:18.690
I mean, he's not gonna get angry
if we don't.

58:52.349 --> 58:53.600
Hey, Tom?

58:54.643 --> 58:58.104
Can you go through it again?
What happened?

58:58.605 --> 59:01.775
I'm gonna go see him.

59:02.691 --> 59:04.109
Do you want to?

59:10.407 --> 59:12.451
I'm gonna watch him down from here.

59:14.203 --> 59:15.663
Okay, so...

59:21.795 --> 59:23.838
Yeah. Okay.
