01:43.562 --> 01:48.901
THE HEROIN BUSTERS

05:49.933 --> 05:52.519
<i>You know what chemistry can do.</i>

05:52.644 --> 05:55.939
<i>Yes, it will take sometime.
Sure, on a political level.</i>

05:56.065 --> 05:58.233
<i>Four billion units
of out-of-date penicillin.</i>

05:58.358 --> 06:00.611
<i>I don't think that's a problem.</i>

06:00.736 --> 06:03.655
We could use the government,
and send it to India as aid.

06:03.781 --> 06:07.117
Sorry, sir. We seem to have a problem
with your subsidiary in Italy.

06:07.242 --> 06:09.244
I know. Would you pass
the call to Malone?

06:09.369 --> 06:10.996
Thanks. Yes, I'm sorry…

06:11.121 --> 06:13.457
- I'll use that phone there.
- No, I don't think so.

06:13.582 --> 06:17.461
Look, don't worry, there's no risk.
We have nothing to worry about.

06:18.253 --> 06:21.548
<i>- Hello, Mr. Meade?</i>
- Hello? No, it's Bob Malone.

06:21.673 --> 06:24.134
<i>One moment, please.
Hold the line.</i>

06:25.511 --> 06:29.306
<i>Mr. Leroy, New York on line 2.
Mr. Malone is holding.</i>

06:30.349 --> 06:33.060
<i>Hello, Mr. Malone?
How are things?</i>

06:33.185 --> 06:37.189
<i>No, if Mr. Meade is busy
I'm happy to speak with you.</i>

06:38.107 --> 06:41.568
We're trying to straighten this out
as fast as we can.

06:41.693 --> 06:42.903
Yes, I understand.

06:43.028 --> 06:46.615
You see, Mr. Leroy,
our company cannot afford

06:46.740 --> 06:49.993
to have our branch offices
make this sort of mistake.

06:50.119 --> 06:52.538
No, this is not to be construed
as a threat, at all.

06:52.663 --> 06:55.374
But you get to work. Do you get me?

06:55.499 --> 07:00.087
Tell Mr. Meade that our merchandize
will be delivered as we agreed.

07:00.212 --> 07:02.005
I can assure you that.

07:02.631 --> 07:05.175
Of course. Goodbye, Mr. Malone.

07:06.051 --> 07:07.803
Now you listen to me, Colonel.

07:07.928 --> 07:12.057
Either you do it my way
or I do it on my own. Is that clear?

07:12.182 --> 07:16.145
Mr. Hamilton, I should remind you
that you're a guest in my country

07:16.270 --> 07:18.522
and that your position
is far from official.

07:18.647 --> 07:20.482
Sure, you guys were good.

07:20.607 --> 07:23.026
You built a fabulous cover-up,
nobody would suspect

07:23.152 --> 07:26.905
this is not a fossil fuel company.

07:27.865 --> 07:30.951
But if you only care about putting
a couple of junkies behind bars,

07:31.076 --> 07:33.829
let's not waste any more time.

07:33.954 --> 07:35.372
I'm being serious.

07:35.998 --> 07:40.502
Our focus is to make life as difficult
as possible for drug dealers.

07:40.627 --> 07:43.380
But with the means at our disposal,
we just can't do more…

07:43.505 --> 07:45.716
How many goddamn times
do I have to say it?

07:45.841 --> 07:49.887
Will you ever understand that Italy is
just a stopover on the drug routes?

07:50.012 --> 07:53.390
Cartagena, Hong Kong,
Amsterdam, Rome,

07:53.515 --> 07:57.019
and then the drugs are shipped
to the United States.

07:58.437 --> 08:02.399
If we can break the circuit,
then we can clean up your country too.

08:02.524 --> 08:05.152
That's my job, that's why I'm here.

08:05.277 --> 08:08.780
But the people we are dealing with
are highly organized

08:08.906 --> 08:11.825
and can easily come up
with a far better plan than ours.

08:14.912 --> 08:18.123
One flight is coming from Amsterdam
and one from Cartagena.

08:18.248 --> 08:19.958
I gave everyone clear instructions.

08:20.083 --> 08:23.420
- Be sure to be there at 2:30 pm.
- Don't worry.

08:23.545 --> 08:25.130
Please.

08:32.554 --> 08:33.931
Is everything ready?

08:53.784 --> 08:55.786
<i>Attention please, the flight…</i>

09:17.516 --> 09:21.979
When the season changes,
I always have stomach issues.

09:22.521 --> 09:24.439
I suffer from gastritis.

09:25.315 --> 09:27.526
Ladies, anything to declare?

09:31.196 --> 09:33.073
How about you? Nothing to declare?

09:41.415 --> 09:43.417
Open your bag, please.

09:43.542 --> 09:45.043
Jesus Christ.

09:46.503 --> 09:49.423
Stop him! Someone stop him!

09:49.548 --> 09:51.800
Don't let him get away! Stop!

09:55.429 --> 09:58.473
These stupid bastards!

09:59.558 --> 10:01.101
They've ruined everything.

10:01.226 --> 10:03.395
Where do you think you're going?

10:04.187 --> 10:06.732
I have to pee, sir.
Is that forbidden?

10:07.983 --> 10:10.152
Have a look at this.

10:11.028 --> 10:14.031
That criminal thought he could fool us!

10:17.909 --> 10:20.746
How long do I have to wait?
If you don't mind, I wanna go.

10:20.871 --> 10:22.789
- Do you have anything to declare?
- No.

10:22.914 --> 10:24.833
- You can go.
- Thank you.

10:27.419 --> 10:29.379
- We got lucky.
- Indeed.

10:30.714 --> 10:34.134
- Get your boss in my office now.
- Yes, sir.

11:07.084 --> 11:08.668
Is everything ready at the hotel?

11:08.794 --> 11:11.380
<i>Yes, we're keeping an eye
on Juan Martinez,</i>

11:11.505 --> 11:13.423
<i>The guy who arrived from Cartagena.</i>

11:13.548 --> 11:16.802
- Has he made any calls yet?
<i>- No, sir.</i>

11:16.927 --> 11:18.887
He must be waiting for this other idiot.

11:44.162 --> 11:45.205
Okay, let's go.

11:45.914 --> 11:49.668
- There's a reservation for me, Ross.
- One moment.

11:56.758 --> 12:00.053
- Shall I take that, sir?
- Yes, thank you.

12:28.123 --> 12:31.042
- Mr. Saint-Just? A call from Paris.
- Thank you.

12:43.305 --> 12:45.557
- Any joy?
- Nothing.

12:45.682 --> 12:48.435
- Me neither.
- Shit.

12:50.479 --> 12:51.897
Hello?

12:53.565 --> 12:56.568
- Ross is going out.
- Let's move.

13:23.637 --> 13:25.639
- So sorry.
- It's alright.

13:33.563 --> 13:35.065
Come on.

13:40.779 --> 13:43.698
- That's the last thing we need.
- I hope so.

13:43.823 --> 13:45.450
Hopefully they'll deliver…

13:45.575 --> 13:47.702
Mr. Sabatino,
a telephone call from Genoa.

13:47.827 --> 13:49.955
Thank you.
It may be the Maiorana people.

13:50.080 --> 13:51.581
Don't forget anything.

13:51.706 --> 13:52.958
I haven't a clue.

14:01.716 --> 14:03.760
- Yes?
- Room 412.

14:03.885 --> 14:05.345
<i>- Hello?</i>
- He's coming up.

14:05.470 --> 14:07.180
He's going to his room.

14:32.289 --> 14:33.373
<i>Hello?</i>

14:37.210 --> 14:38.336
Call our contact.

14:54.269 --> 14:55.812
He fooled us!

15:14.789 --> 15:17.834
Who were you supposed
to be meeting here, you bastard?

15:47.989 --> 15:51.326
This is Ross
as he arrived to the hotel.

15:51.451 --> 15:53.787
His bags were empty, it wasn't him.

15:53.912 --> 15:56.498
Look at his coat.

15:56.623 --> 15:58.041
That's how they screwed us.

15:58.166 --> 16:01.670
He waltzed into the hotel
with the stuff on him, but left without it.

16:01.795 --> 16:04.130
The coke was in the coat, goddamn it!

16:05.256 --> 16:08.259
And the bastard flushed the rest
down the toilet.

16:09.260 --> 16:12.597
He doesn't "habla the lingo",
so now we're fucked!

16:12.722 --> 16:15.517
Two months' work
down the drain, right?

16:17.185 --> 16:20.271
We wanted one of the contacts,
and what do we end up with?

16:20.397 --> 16:22.273
This asshole
and this other son of a bitch!

16:24.025 --> 16:27.529
Stop it! You and your friend
are out of circulation.

16:27.654 --> 16:29.197
Think about saving yourself.

16:29.322 --> 16:32.409
But don't worry,
we'll catch the other guys too.

16:33.868 --> 16:35.286
Hey!

16:37.205 --> 16:38.707
What the hell is that?

16:38.832 --> 16:41.251
A document for you to sign
to confirm we brought him here.

16:42.001 --> 16:43.002
Oh, great.

16:43.128 --> 16:46.464
I should've known it was hard
to screw you guys over at Customs.

16:47.048 --> 16:51.720
Since you're here,
you can take that poor guy.

16:51.845 --> 16:53.513
What's the charge? What did he do?

16:53.638 --> 16:56.224
He clogged up a toilet.
Now get him outta here!

16:56.349 --> 16:58.768
- Come on.
- I'll call the Colonel.

16:59.811 --> 17:03.440
Don't forget these, boss.
They're not necessary.

17:03.898 --> 17:07.110
Just don't cut the watch.
It was a present from my mother.

17:08.069 --> 17:10.029
Thank you very much.

17:15.326 --> 17:16.911
Much better.

17:19.622 --> 17:21.082
May I sit?

17:21.207 --> 17:23.585
There's no oil on it, is there?

17:23.710 --> 17:26.463
You're cute, really.
You make me laugh.

17:26.588 --> 17:29.048
- Sit down.
- Yes, sir.

17:31.509 --> 17:32.927
Thanks.

17:35.472 --> 17:40.393
Okay. Who do you work for,
and who are you bringing the stuff to?

17:40.518 --> 17:43.897
Why did you guys choose a place
like this? It's so depressing.

17:44.022 --> 17:48.276
I don't have time to waste.
Did you not hear my question?

17:48.401 --> 17:51.654
Who do you work for,
and who were you bringing the stuff to?

17:51.780 --> 17:54.657
"Stuff"? What stuff?
You mean the drugs?

17:56.493 --> 17:58.912
Nobody. I work for me.

17:59.037 --> 18:01.956
- Three kilos?
- I thought I'd stock up.

18:02.081 --> 18:05.210
They told me this stuff was
kinda hard to find in Rome.

18:06.294 --> 18:08.087
You know…

18:08.213 --> 18:10.799
The police, they're so smart.

18:10.924 --> 18:12.467
Yes.

18:13.760 --> 18:15.845
They're also good-natured,

18:15.970 --> 18:17.555
very kind,

18:17.680 --> 18:19.307
and patient.

18:19.432 --> 18:22.769
And they go to church every Sunday.

18:23.686 --> 18:25.188
So…

18:26.648 --> 18:28.733
Do you care to answer my question?

18:28.858 --> 18:32.153
Who are you working for,
and who were you bringing the drugs to?

18:34.030 --> 18:37.617
I told you, I'm a bit of a junkie.

18:39.786 --> 18:42.747
Open up your ears, you clown!

18:42.872 --> 18:47.085
If you think this place sucks,
you should see the local jail.

18:47.210 --> 18:48.920
It's much worse.

18:49.629 --> 18:53.258
Now you're officially free.
You saw me sign that paper.

18:53.383 --> 18:56.052
As a matter of fact,
you don't even exist!

18:56.177 --> 19:00.181
But if you don't open that mouth of yours
and tell us everything,

19:00.306 --> 19:04.352
I will personally smash your face in
and send you straight to hell.

19:04.477 --> 19:05.645
Understand me?

19:05.770 --> 19:08.940
Eight… nine…

19:09.649 --> 19:10.984
Ten.

19:11.109 --> 19:14.237
You bring me 300,000 lira.

19:14.362 --> 19:17.323
- Where's my fix?
- Here it is.

19:19.117 --> 19:21.452
Don't cut our stuff.

19:21.578 --> 19:23.705
We're a serious business.

19:23.830 --> 19:25.498
Fucking junkie.

19:34.465 --> 19:38.845
That guy's the one with the stuff.
I buy it from him.

19:38.970 --> 19:41.306
I changed my mind,
I don't wanna do this.

19:41.431 --> 19:45.226
Look, you won't become an addict
if you only try it once.

19:45.351 --> 19:48.438
Maybe, but I'm scared.
Anyway, where would I get the money?

19:48.563 --> 19:51.691
I can lend you the money.
Don't worry about that.

19:55.904 --> 19:57.739
Are you coming or not?

19:57.864 --> 19:59.324
Come on!

20:13.713 --> 20:15.214
Dad, he's the guy.

20:25.224 --> 20:27.393
I'll kill you!

20:28.811 --> 20:31.105
Come on, you! Out, you punk!

20:38.196 --> 20:40.156
- What are they doing?
- How do I know?

20:40.281 --> 20:43.576
- Call the police!
- They're killing him!

20:53.378 --> 20:56.798
Get inside!
You can keep each other company.

21:24.909 --> 21:26.619
Did they beat you up?

21:28.955 --> 21:32.542
They like to kick the shit out of you,
it gets rid of their frustrations.

21:32.667 --> 21:35.128
Do you know why
the pigs are so angry?

21:35.253 --> 21:37.547
Because they're underpaid.

21:38.297 --> 21:42.343
The less they get paid,
the more they beat people up.

21:42.468 --> 21:44.846
No, they didn't do it.

21:44.971 --> 21:48.433
I was pushing in front of the school.

21:49.183 --> 21:50.768
And I got caught.

21:52.520 --> 21:55.273
Junkies and hookers are all the same.

21:56.524 --> 22:00.153
You're all just dying to tell
your life story. It's shit.

22:04.407 --> 22:08.202
I wasn't trying to step on anybody's toes.

22:08.327 --> 22:11.414
I used to go to that school,
until two years ago.

22:11.539 --> 22:15.168
That's where I got my first joint.

22:15.293 --> 22:18.671
They give you the first two or three
for free, then they tell you,

22:18.796 --> 22:22.216
"Come on, try shooting up some of this.
It's beautiful.

22:24.469 --> 22:27.346
"It's strong,
it's gonna make you feel so good.

22:27.889 --> 22:30.475
"You'll fly so high."

22:30.600 --> 22:32.977
You finally feel important.

22:33.478 --> 22:38.691
But then, when you come back down,
then it's like death.

22:40.610 --> 22:42.904
You're worth less than zero.

22:44.864 --> 22:47.450
Fucking bastards!

22:47.575 --> 22:49.577
I need a fix!

22:50.870 --> 22:53.998
Help me! Did you hear me!

22:54.123 --> 22:55.833
That guy's getting on my nerves.

22:55.958 --> 22:57.418
Poor soul.

22:57.543 --> 22:59.670
He's in a bad way. Let's go.

23:00.755 --> 23:02.548
Help me!

23:06.177 --> 23:09.013
I need a fix! I need a fix!

23:09.138 --> 23:12.016
Cut it out, will you? Stop it!

23:12.975 --> 23:16.312
They take the drugs from you,
they won't ever give them back.

23:16.437 --> 23:19.107
Open up! Give me a fix!

23:48.010 --> 23:51.556
Help me, please. Don't let me die.

23:54.725 --> 23:57.436
Help me, in the name of God.

23:58.229 --> 24:00.648
In the name of whatever the hell
you believe in.

24:00.773 --> 24:02.191
Help me.

24:04.360 --> 24:07.196
Wait! Stop, stop, stop!
I'll give you something.

24:07.321 --> 24:08.865
You just relax. Don't move.

24:12.618 --> 24:14.579
Incredible, isn't it?

24:14.704 --> 24:16.706
It's my private stash.

24:18.958 --> 24:22.086
Here, take it. I can go without.

24:22.211 --> 24:23.880
But just for today.

25:07.965 --> 25:11.594
<i>Mother, quick! Hurry up!</i>

25:11.719 --> 25:15.723
<i>- I feel sick!
- I'm coming!</i>

25:15.848 --> 25:17.183
<i>Hurry!</i>

25:19.227 --> 25:21.020
Hurry!

25:21.145 --> 25:23.814
- Please, try to be still.
- Help me!

25:24.523 --> 25:26.609
You'll feel better soon.

25:30.863 --> 25:33.616
See, I told you.

25:34.825 --> 25:36.619
You are so beautiful, darling.

25:37.119 --> 25:40.081
You're so beautiful
when you're not screaming.

25:40.706 --> 25:43.834
Your mother's here with you.
She'll take care of everything.

25:43.960 --> 25:48.172
Just don't go with those guys,
ever again!

25:48.297 --> 25:51.175
Oh, God! Who could that be?
I'll be right back.

25:55.054 --> 25:56.472
Who is it?

25:58.975 --> 26:01.310
No, please!
I'll bring the money to you tomorrow!

26:01.435 --> 26:04.313
- Just get over there and shut up.
- Please! Please!

26:04.438 --> 26:07.817
- Do what I tell you!
- I'll pay you tomorrow!

26:09.652 --> 26:11.654
Well, don't you look lovely?

26:13.281 --> 26:15.408
No, don't! Don't touch her!

26:15.533 --> 26:16.867
Shut your mouth!

26:16.993 --> 26:20.288
Don't speak to me,
you miserable cow!

26:20.413 --> 26:25.710
Bring me the money or I'll put both
of you losers out of circulation!

26:30.006 --> 26:32.008
Don't worry about it.

26:32.133 --> 26:35.636
Your mother won't leave you.
I will fix everything.

26:39.140 --> 26:42.601
- Where's Paolo?
- Can't you see we're busy?

26:42.727 --> 26:45.396
Get fucking lost!

26:48.941 --> 26:51.027
You can tell me.

26:56.157 --> 26:59.285
Sergio! You'll have the money
tomorrow, I swear.

27:01.454 --> 27:03.539
Tomorrow… I'll go see my mom.

27:03.664 --> 27:06.959
She's collecting her pension.
I'll pay you then.

27:07.543 --> 27:11.881
Steal her pension
or whatever else you want.

27:12.006 --> 27:14.717
You can sell her kidneys,
for all I care.

27:14.842 --> 27:16.427
But you better pay me.

27:16.969 --> 27:18.929
Did you hear me?

27:19.513 --> 27:21.891
Otherwise I'll drown you in the john.

27:27.730 --> 27:29.231
I'll pay you.

27:30.066 --> 27:32.109
My mom will give me the money.

27:51.504 --> 27:53.547
Open this door!

27:57.176 --> 27:59.887
- What is it?
- I don't know, but I think…

28:00.012 --> 28:03.432
I think the guy might be dying.
Come take a look.

28:04.100 --> 28:05.226
Look at him.

28:06.018 --> 28:08.229
What do you want me to do?
I'm not a doctor.

28:08.354 --> 28:10.689
- Get back!
- Help him out.

28:10.815 --> 28:12.858
- What's wrong?
- Help him.

28:21.575 --> 28:23.452
Come on, let's go.

28:42.304 --> 28:43.681
<i>Hello?</i>

28:45.015 --> 28:46.517
<i>What?</i>

28:47.393 --> 28:50.354
<i>What were you guys doing, sleeping?</i>

28:51.147 --> 28:53.023
<i>Alright, forget it.</i>

28:53.899 --> 28:56.694
<i>If anybody tells headquarters,
I'll tear them apart.</i>

28:56.819 --> 29:00.823
No, of course I don't want him arrested!
I wanna know who his contacts are.

29:02.700 --> 29:03.951
Yeah.

29:04.410 --> 29:06.120
Yeah, alright.

29:17.214 --> 29:19.258
Wait here, I'll get my girlfriend.

29:20.926 --> 29:24.096
Give it to me, please.
I brought the money.

29:24.847 --> 29:26.849
Please, I beg you.

29:27.641 --> 29:31.395
Send down your daughter,
she can have a fix for free.

29:31.520 --> 29:33.814
No, please, don't hurt her!

29:36.025 --> 29:37.359
Thank you.

29:39.820 --> 29:41.322
Listen…

29:41.447 --> 29:44.700
If you need some strong stuff,
go talk to those two guys.

29:44.825 --> 29:47.369
But be very careful,
if you can't pay cash,

29:47.495 --> 29:50.664
they can make your life difficult.

29:50.789 --> 29:54.585
You see, personally, I prefer weed.

29:54.710 --> 29:57.838
It's less dangerous.
Are you interested in weed?

29:57.963 --> 30:00.799
Ah, you're not?
Nobody's interested anymore.

30:01.926 --> 30:03.719
Ah, there he is. What do you say?

30:03.844 --> 30:06.138
Hey, you did the right thing.

30:06.263 --> 30:08.807
It's such an easy job.
Like stealing candy off a child.

30:08.933 --> 30:13.604
For God's sake, how many times
do I have to tell you? No! No! And no!

30:13.729 --> 30:17.149
- Such a loser.
- He'll be back.

30:19.443 --> 30:23.447
- As if…
- No, you don't get it, Filiberto!

30:23.572 --> 30:25.574
Let's try it from the top.

30:25.699 --> 30:28.244
You, come here.

30:28.369 --> 30:31.914
No, you don't move! Stay there!

30:32.039 --> 30:33.958
You, take a step forward.

30:34.083 --> 30:37.920
Yes, here. Keep going…
Not you!

30:38.045 --> 30:40.464
- Hi, Gillo.
- Hey. What part are you playing?

30:40.589 --> 30:42.091
I'm a condom.

30:42.216 --> 30:43.968
What happened to you?

30:45.177 --> 30:47.805
- Nothing. I was busted out of jail.
- What?

30:47.930 --> 30:51.684
- Were you in jail?
- Yes, but we got out.

30:51.809 --> 30:53.769
I need your help. We gotta hide.

30:53.894 --> 30:56.313
I have a friend.
He got arrested at the airport.

30:56.438 --> 30:58.190
- Give me your keys.
- I'm not sure…

30:58.315 --> 31:00.943
- Please, we have no time to waste.
- How can you trust him?

31:01.068 --> 31:02.528
He's a friend, he got me out.

31:02.653 --> 31:04.363
SHIT!

31:04.488 --> 31:06.365
Here we are.

31:07.950 --> 31:09.618
This is Vera's place.

31:09.743 --> 31:12.121
It's nothing special,
but at least we're safe.

31:13.747 --> 31:15.249
Cute place.

31:35.352 --> 31:37.062
Son of a bitch!

31:40.274 --> 31:42.985
- Keep him down!
- I'll do it.

31:43.485 --> 31:45.529
I'll take care of him. I'll kill him.

31:47.072 --> 31:50.034
No, stop it!
He's the guy who helped me escape.

31:50.159 --> 31:53.829
He's the one
in cahoots with the pigs!

31:53.954 --> 31:59.001
How else could you two
have made it out?

31:59.126 --> 32:02.921
They did arrest him
with 3 kgs of stuff.

32:03.047 --> 32:06.884
- He's that guy?
- Yes, that idiot.

32:07.009 --> 32:10.721
Maybe he's got more, don't you think?

32:13.849 --> 32:17.603
Since the pigs are onto you,
we'll push the stuff.

32:17.728 --> 32:19.855
You don't have to do anything.

32:19.980 --> 32:22.775
Just hand us the stuff,
we'll give you a cut.

32:22.900 --> 32:26.028
You can live a quiet life.
So? What do you say?

32:26.153 --> 32:28.447
I say that you're a bastard!

32:31.367 --> 32:34.662
Get outta here!
I don't deal with punks like you.

32:35.120 --> 32:36.538
Jog on!

32:36.664 --> 32:39.083
And don't come back
without your daddy!

32:39.750 --> 32:41.960
Maybe I'll reach an agreement
with him.

32:42.086 --> 32:43.504
Maybe.

32:44.296 --> 32:47.841
Chill out now.
We may have found you a deal.

32:47.966 --> 32:50.886
The boss is a tough cookie.

32:51.011 --> 32:53.722
Well, you go tell him.

32:59.603 --> 33:01.313
See? It was easy.

33:03.565 --> 33:07.403
Oh! Are you looking for daddy?
He's waiting for you.

33:44.523 --> 33:47.693
So, here you are.

33:48.152 --> 33:50.696
Come down,
let me have a look at you.

33:59.621 --> 34:02.416
I see, you want to sit down.

34:02.541 --> 34:04.710
Fine, stay seated then.

34:05.627 --> 34:07.921
I like people who are on time.

34:08.046 --> 34:10.924
It's a good way to start
a new business relationship.

34:11.049 --> 34:12.634
What can you offer?

34:12.760 --> 34:17.514
Hey, you're going pretty fast for a guy
who lets the others do the walking.

34:17.639 --> 34:21.977
The trouble is,
newcomers are a pain in the ass.

34:22.102 --> 34:26.315
Pushing drugs is not easy,
I presume you know that.

34:26.899 --> 34:30.778
You'd still be dealing with us.
At our prices.

34:30.903 --> 34:32.780
That is the only way.

34:33.405 --> 34:36.658
If you try to go over our heads,
you're screwed.

34:36.784 --> 34:40.662
There's a guy in New York
just like you.

34:41.163 --> 34:43.165
Same jacket too.

34:43.290 --> 34:45.584
Yeah? What happened to him?

34:45.709 --> 34:47.711
He ended up working for me.

34:49.129 --> 34:51.423
But he had to beg me.

34:51.548 --> 34:54.885
- I assume things didn't work out.
- You can't even get some sleep!

34:55.010 --> 34:58.180
Going big doesn't last very long
in New York.

34:58.305 --> 35:00.557
I didn't feel at home there.

35:00.682 --> 35:03.018
So I thought I'd come back home,

35:03.143 --> 35:06.980
and start my own business here.

35:07.105 --> 35:08.857
Did I make the right call?

35:10.484 --> 35:14.238
- Do you want to work with us?
- Well, with you…

35:14.363 --> 35:16.198
Or against you, if needs must.

35:16.323 --> 35:18.617
I see, you read the Bible.

35:19.159 --> 35:20.994
But you're no prophet.

35:22.329 --> 35:24.498
Actually, you're a clown.

35:24.623 --> 35:28.460
And I have a feeling that
all this talk about New York…

35:29.670 --> 35:31.755
… is bullshit.

35:31.880 --> 35:35.592
But I will give you a chance.
I have a job for you.

35:35.717 --> 35:39.638
- Police. Get out.
- What do you want?

35:39.763 --> 35:42.015
He's not here.

35:42.140 --> 35:45.227
Everything's clean here.
Let's go.

35:46.311 --> 35:48.188
Bye, darlings.

36:10.002 --> 36:13.088
Maybe they'll deal with him,
so we won't have to.

36:13.213 --> 36:15.382
I'm gonna go watch the show.

36:22.472 --> 36:27.561
What are you doing…?
Damn, what's the world coming to?

36:27.686 --> 36:30.689
And now what?
I'm not a taxi!

37:33.251 --> 37:35.587
- Boom!
- Don't be an asshole.

37:35.712 --> 37:37.881
That was a good workout.

37:38.632 --> 37:40.300
You're insane.

37:44.471 --> 37:45.681
But how…

37:45.806 --> 37:49.476
You should've called the hotel,
not my office.

37:49.601 --> 37:51.353
We have to hurry up, damn it.

37:52.145 --> 37:55.899
Mike, I'm getting tired
of mixing with those creeps.

37:56.024 --> 37:57.359
I understand.

37:57.484 --> 38:01.655
- Have you found out anything useful?
- No. At least not yet.

38:03.323 --> 38:05.534
The punks I met are small fish, but…

38:06.743 --> 38:09.329
… I might be onto the big one.

38:09.454 --> 38:12.916
They're sending me to Genoa
to meet up with members of a gang.

38:13.458 --> 38:15.377
At least that's something.

38:15.502 --> 38:16.920
Listen…

38:17.754 --> 38:21.258
It's getting very hard for me
to cover for you.

38:21.383 --> 38:22.634
Yes, I know.

38:22.759 --> 38:25.053
Don't worry about it.
It's my life after all.

38:25.846 --> 38:27.222
I don't want to…

38:27.931 --> 38:30.559
Let's get back to it. Come here!

38:30.684 --> 38:33.103
Sorry…
You son of a bitch!

38:37.733 --> 38:39.192
Not bad!

38:43.572 --> 38:45.699
What's the matter?

38:49.661 --> 38:51.496
What's happened?

38:52.748 --> 38:54.291
Nothing.

38:56.126 --> 38:59.421
- Do you feel like talking a bit?
- Yeah, sure.

39:01.339 --> 39:04.509
You know, this morning,
when I was in that theater,

39:04.634 --> 39:07.512
two pigs came round looking for me.

40:16.331 --> 40:19.709
See you soon, baby.
You are so cute.

40:23.588 --> 40:25.257
Hi, boys.

40:25.382 --> 40:28.343
Vera, come on, let's go.
That guy won't be there forever.

40:28.468 --> 40:30.887
Out of my way!
I have some work to do.

40:32.597 --> 40:36.643
Well, listen to this guy.
This is my house, you know?

40:37.561 --> 40:39.646
I know. I know.

40:39.771 --> 40:43.233
But sometimes I have work too.

40:44.526 --> 40:47.362
- Please?
- Fine, let's go.

40:50.657 --> 40:52.826
Give me the cash.

40:56.872 --> 40:59.416
- Give me the stuff.
- I'm not a butcher!

40:59.541 --> 41:02.169
Vera, give him the money.
Now give me the drugs!

41:03.211 --> 41:06.423
This is partial payment
for the 300,000 you owe us already.

41:06.548 --> 41:08.091
What are you talking about?

41:08.216 --> 41:10.844
Don't be an ass! It's my money!

41:11.720 --> 41:13.263
You coward! I'm gonna kill you!

41:13.388 --> 41:16.558
Calm down, my friends.
Don't be like that.

41:19.644 --> 41:25.817
Ah, Gillo! How many times
do I have to say it? Go to hell!

41:26.693 --> 41:30.989
I'll send you straight there.
I'm gonna break all your bones!

41:31.990 --> 41:32.991
Gillo!

41:33.116 --> 41:35.160
Are you leaving already?

41:35.952 --> 41:38.955
Driver's license, registration…

41:41.333 --> 41:43.335
… 50 million lira.

41:44.252 --> 41:46.087
You wanna count it?

41:46.755 --> 41:48.882
No, I trust you.

41:50.008 --> 41:52.135
So you should.

41:52.260 --> 41:55.305
You know what happens
if you don't deliver this stuff?

41:55.430 --> 41:58.475
Sure, I don't get the drugs.

41:58.600 --> 42:00.310
Listen…

42:00.435 --> 42:06.066
If I wanted to rip off small change,
I'd be a pickpocket.

42:07.734 --> 42:12.364
- Tell me, what is this Genoa guy like?
- He's clean, so far.

42:13.657 --> 42:16.618
Although he's starting to worry
about the Tunisians.

42:16.743 --> 42:19.537
You know, it's like having fleas.

42:19.663 --> 42:21.373
They suck your blood.

42:21.498 --> 42:23.708
<i>But we need the stuff
and only the Tunisians have it.</i>

42:23.833 --> 42:26.836
<i>My guy in Genoa
will give you the contact.</i>

42:29.422 --> 42:32.550
Meet them at the old mill.
They told me you're good.

42:32.676 --> 42:35.553
But keep your eyes open.
You can't trust those Tunisians.

42:37.681 --> 42:40.225
Look at this idiot!

42:40.350 --> 42:42.602
Dad, please! Help me out!

42:42.727 --> 42:45.021
It's the last time I'll ever ask you.

42:45.146 --> 42:46.898
I need it bad.

42:48.942 --> 42:50.151
I'm begging you…

42:50.277 --> 42:53.989
<i>I'm sorry, Gillo. You're dead to me.
I don't have a son anymore.</i>

42:54.948 --> 42:56.574
You old bastard!

42:57.951 --> 42:59.953
We need a third man.

43:01.246 --> 43:03.707
- You help us, you get this.
- Do you understand?

43:03.832 --> 43:05.625
- Yes, yes.
- Come.

43:06.251 --> 43:08.003
Gillo! Gillo…

44:50.730 --> 44:55.068
They sent me here to make a deal,
not to play target practice!

45:25.598 --> 45:27.392
Give it here.

45:34.441 --> 45:36.151
Okay, okay!

45:40.655 --> 45:42.699
Put your guns away.

45:43.491 --> 45:45.160
Come on, guys!

45:46.661 --> 45:49.205
And now, throw me the stuff.

45:49.330 --> 45:51.666
Come on, you've been paid.

45:54.586 --> 45:56.588
That's a lousy throw.

46:01.759 --> 46:03.636
Be good, boys.

46:04.804 --> 46:07.640
I'm sure you don't want trouble.

46:32.957 --> 46:34.375
Don't move!

46:38.588 --> 46:40.590
What are you waiting for?

46:41.299 --> 46:43.218
Put the gun down.

46:44.511 --> 46:45.929
Good man.

46:48.056 --> 46:49.390
Listen…

46:51.392 --> 46:55.480
You tell your guys that
from now on, I'm the boss.

46:56.564 --> 46:58.399
Do you understand?

46:58.525 --> 47:02.487
No one moves a finger
without my say so.

47:02.612 --> 47:04.197
Understand?

47:04.322 --> 47:05.782
You understand?

47:08.034 --> 47:10.411
Go on, then. Piss off!

47:28.805 --> 47:31.891
Of course, come back
when you're ready.

47:32.016 --> 47:34.060
- Thank you so much.
- Not at all.

47:35.687 --> 47:37.564
See you soon.

47:37.689 --> 47:39.566
Have a good day, madam.

47:40.400 --> 47:42.193
This is a robbery, put your hands up!

47:42.318 --> 47:45.238
Scream and I'll kill you.
Open the safe!

47:46.072 --> 47:49.117
Let's stay calm.
I'll give you everything you want.

47:49.242 --> 47:51.869
Hurry up, open that safe!

47:51.995 --> 47:53.413
What are you doing?

48:01.004 --> 48:02.672
You criminal…

48:07.260 --> 48:10.179
You filthy, rotten scum!
You killed him!

48:29.407 --> 48:31.075
Poor girl.

48:33.328 --> 48:37.165
What did you put in that fix?
Brotherly love?

48:37.999 --> 48:41.544
The path to freedom? Sure.

48:41.669 --> 48:45.381
Now she won't be able
to insult you anymore.

48:45.506 --> 48:48.718
But I'll keep reminding you
what bastards you are.

48:49.427 --> 48:52.639
You weirdo, go to hell.

48:52.764 --> 48:58.394
No, wait. You must listen to me.
I am just like you.

48:58.519 --> 49:02.857
You know that.
We all kill because of the drugs.

49:03.524 --> 49:06.444
Why did that freak have to die in here?

49:06.569 --> 49:09.906
We'll have the pigs on us now,
and we can't deal in Genoa.

49:10.031 --> 49:13.242
Let's find another place.
Maybe Palermo or Naples?

49:13.368 --> 49:16.788
It's not that easy
to establish a contact.

49:16.913 --> 49:19.874
We can try to push this shit
that they sold you in Genoa.

49:19.999 --> 49:23.711
These junkies will shoot up anything.

49:23.836 --> 49:25.505
Listen…

49:26.047 --> 49:28.466
I know a place where
I can find you the good stuff.

49:28.591 --> 49:30.968
Where? The police have cut off
our supply in town.

49:31.094 --> 49:34.681
Don't you get it?
The whole town is clean.

49:34.806 --> 49:36.557
You don't get it.

49:36.683 --> 49:41.938
I told you, I know a place
where you can find the good stuff.

49:45.692 --> 49:47.318
The cops.

49:49.904 --> 49:52.323
Just give me two guys
who know their shit.

49:52.448 --> 49:56.119
- I can give you a hundred of them.
- Two will be enough.

49:56.244 --> 49:59.163
You know I'm doing everything
I can here.

49:59.288 --> 50:01.666
- Don't mess it up.
- You already told me.

50:01.791 --> 50:05.545
I get the stuff
and I bring it to Tor Di Quinto,

50:05.670 --> 50:08.881
where the shooting range is.

50:09.006 --> 50:11.092
- Alright?
- Yes, alright.

50:11.217 --> 50:13.344
I'll do my bit, don't worry.

50:13.845 --> 50:17.014
- But don't mess things up.
<i>- Yes, you said that.</i>

51:00.683 --> 51:03.936
You want us to walk into the courthouse
dressed like cops? You must be crazy!

51:04.061 --> 51:06.856
Last time I was there,
they had me handcuffed.

51:06.981 --> 51:09.275
They won't recognize me.

51:09.400 --> 51:12.278
Since the last time,
I gained 40 lbs and grew a beard.

51:12.403 --> 51:14.030
I look like Fidel Castro!

51:14.155 --> 51:16.491
Cuba, that's where you should be.

51:36.969 --> 51:38.805
Well? Where is this place?

51:38.930 --> 51:41.182
Shut up and stay close to me.

52:29.063 --> 52:31.482
Keep your head high, like real cops.

52:48.416 --> 52:50.877
You got more?

52:51.919 --> 52:54.839
- What?
- More drugs. How much did you find?

52:55.756 --> 52:58.134
Loads. Let us in, will you?

52:58.259 --> 52:59.760
Go ahead.

53:04.473 --> 53:06.392
Here, for you.

53:07.727 --> 53:09.770
- More drugs.
- Yes.

53:09.896 --> 53:11.314
And they say we're lazy!

53:11.439 --> 53:14.233
We have so much,
it's coming out of the walls.

53:14.358 --> 53:16.110
Have you? For real?

53:16.235 --> 53:19.238
- Have a look
- I see. Hands up. Keep them up!

53:19.363 --> 53:20.823
What's going on?

53:22.199 --> 53:24.076
- Here, give me your hands.
- Yes.

53:24.201 --> 53:26.370
- Relax, boss!
- I'm calm.

53:26.495 --> 53:28.831
Good man. Come here.

53:33.210 --> 53:34.503
Stop!

53:40.009 --> 53:43.471
You idiot, you're ruining everything.
You'll get us caught.

53:44.096 --> 53:46.766
Put that gun away. Move it!

53:46.891 --> 53:49.977
Go help him out. Move!

54:02.573 --> 54:04.075
Hey, boss!

54:04.700 --> 54:08.454
Is nobody here?
What about those three that just left?

54:09.121 --> 54:13.250
- Boss!
- Hey! I'm talking to you!

54:14.543 --> 54:17.755
Hold on! Where are you going?

54:18.381 --> 54:19.674
Hey, stop!

54:20.341 --> 54:22.635
- Don't turn around.
- Wait a moment, you!

54:25.429 --> 54:27.348
Get down!

54:56.836 --> 54:58.254
What's going on?

54:59.839 --> 55:01.465
You dirty…

55:05.052 --> 55:06.470
You scum…

55:42.339 --> 55:44.341
Get over there. On the floor!

55:44.884 --> 55:46.469
Down! Down!

55:51.098 --> 55:52.266
You…!

56:10.868 --> 56:13.537
Three men were shot
at the courthouse.

57:02.294 --> 57:05.339
What's he doing?
Is he driving off? Come on!

57:26.402 --> 57:28.404
Well, 30,000 lira is a bit steep.

57:29.530 --> 57:31.240
Could I not get a discount?

57:31.365 --> 57:36.162
You already got one.
Make up your mind.

57:43.919 --> 57:46.213
I can't go lower than 25,000.

57:47.506 --> 57:50.843
Is my place not good enough for you?

57:57.391 --> 57:59.393
Make up your mind, honey.

58:19.079 --> 58:22.041
What? You're going?
Go to hell, you faggot!

59:01.580 --> 59:03.040
Let's go!

59:51.964 --> 59:54.174
What the fuck is this?

59:57.094 --> 59:59.555
You know what it is?
A homing device!

59:59.680 --> 1:00:00.973
Look!

1:00:01.473 --> 1:00:03.559
We're screwed now!

1:00:03.684 --> 1:00:05.894
That son of a bitch!

1:00:06.020 --> 1:00:08.147
I knew it!
From the very first day…

1:00:08.272 --> 1:00:11.066
- Shut up, you idiot!
- What do we do?

1:00:12.818 --> 1:00:13.819
Hey, you!

1:03:21.673 --> 1:03:24.009
I can't just leave you alone.
Let me have a look.

1:03:24.134 --> 1:03:27.012
You can play the doctor later.
Look…

1:03:28.805 --> 1:03:30.516
My inside pocket…

1:03:30.641 --> 1:03:32.893
Call that number if necessary.

1:03:33.018 --> 1:03:35.354
He's one of the big guys.
He's up to speed.

1:03:35.479 --> 1:03:38.023
- Where are those bastards?
- At the chemical plant.

1:03:38.148 --> 1:03:41.151
<i>Assuming the van
hasn't been stolen or fixed.</i>

1:03:53.664 --> 1:03:55.082
Stop, goddamn it!

1:04:07.302 --> 1:04:09.555
Hello? Is this Urbe Airport?

1:04:09.680 --> 1:04:13.642
Leroy speaking,
I'd like to speak with Mr. Guidi.

1:04:13.767 --> 1:04:16.186
<i>Please hold, his extension is engaged.</i>

1:04:19.189 --> 1:04:20.732
<i>I'll connect you now.</i>

1:04:20.857 --> 1:04:24.361
Hello, Mr. Guidi?
This is Leroy speaking.

1:04:24.486 --> 1:04:27.781
I'll need a plane in two hours,
I'm flying to Milan.

1:04:27.906 --> 1:04:29.992
Yes, the cargo will be medicines,
as usual.

1:04:30.117 --> 1:04:33.161
Great. Thank you.

1:04:43.255 --> 1:04:47.926
It's tough being a cop.
You get shot even if you're not in uniform.

1:04:48.051 --> 1:04:51.221
Everybody's getting shot.
Hold on tight.

1:04:51.346 --> 1:04:54.057
Oh! I'm so sorry…

1:04:54.182 --> 1:04:55.892
Hold tight.

1:05:59.331 --> 1:06:00.832
Hands up!

1:06:02.584 --> 1:06:04.336
Hit the floor!

1:06:04.461 --> 1:06:07.923
- What are you waiting for? Down!
- You Judas!

1:06:08.632 --> 1:06:11.259
Get down on the ground
with the other apostles.

1:06:13.929 --> 1:06:15.764
Come on, get down!

1:06:15.889 --> 1:06:20.102
Now start crawling outta here
on your hands! Go on!

1:06:20.227 --> 1:06:21.478
Get out!

1:06:22.521 --> 1:06:24.314
Hurry up! On your hands!

1:06:25.732 --> 1:06:30.028
- And no funny business.
- I bet the pigs paid you well.

1:06:30.153 --> 1:06:32.155
Face down and shut your mouth!

1:06:32.280 --> 1:06:34.157
Keep crawling.

1:06:34.282 --> 1:06:36.034
Move it!

1:06:36.159 --> 1:06:37.619
You, quicker!

1:06:38.662 --> 1:06:40.288
Hands on the ground!

1:06:40.414 --> 1:06:41.957
Out of here!

1:06:42.082 --> 1:06:43.417
Quicker! Quicker!

1:07:38.972 --> 1:07:41.224
There he is! There!

1:07:54.321 --> 1:07:55.906
Get the car!

1:08:01.161 --> 1:08:02.496
Go!

1:08:56.883 --> 1:09:00.220
We gotta hurry up
if we want to catch him.

1:09:09.563 --> 1:09:11.273
Come on, this way!

1:12:30.805 --> 1:12:33.767
- He got away!
- Bastard!

1:12:53.953 --> 1:12:57.457
Come on, run!
We can't let him get away!

1:12:57.582 --> 1:13:01.544
We're at Chemical Pharmaceuticals,
on the Tuscolana Route.

1:13:01.669 --> 1:13:03.546
There was a shootout, one victim.

1:13:03.671 --> 1:13:05.799
I did my best, sir.

1:13:05.924 --> 1:13:07.842
You should get to the hospital.

1:13:07.967 --> 1:13:10.303
A hospital in Rome?
Are you trying to get rid of me?

1:13:10.428 --> 1:13:13.223
- Where the hell's the Colonel?
- Right here.

1:13:15.266 --> 1:13:19.312
You're lucky.
They couldn't get rid of all the drugs.

1:13:29.656 --> 1:13:32.158
- You're weird…
- Whatever.

1:13:32.283 --> 1:13:34.410
- Is there a telephone here?
- Right there.

1:13:35.912 --> 1:13:37.705
Listen, just call the guy…

1:13:37.831 --> 1:13:39.624
- Excuse me, Miss.
- And make plans.

1:13:39.749 --> 1:13:42.877
A double date would be fun.

1:13:43.002 --> 1:13:46.840
- Listen, it's an emergency…
- I'm on the phone, can't you see?

1:13:48.091 --> 1:13:50.426
- Call him…
- Is there another phone here?

1:13:50.552 --> 1:13:53.221
- No, only that one.
- Just wait a moment.

1:13:55.598 --> 1:13:59.144
- Listen, it's really urgent…
- Just wait a minute!

1:13:59.269 --> 1:14:02.272
Can't you see I'm talking?
I only just got here.

1:14:02.397 --> 1:14:05.483
Calm down!
Some crazy guy…

1:14:12.532 --> 1:14:13.950
Looking for something?

1:14:14.075 --> 1:14:18.163
- I was just looking…
- You looked, now go!

1:14:22.458 --> 1:14:23.960
That's him!

1:14:27.755 --> 1:14:30.633
- Why are you chasing him?
- Are you cops?

1:14:30.758 --> 1:14:34.971
- I'll call you back.
- What's happening?

1:14:35.096 --> 1:14:38.850
- What do you want?
- That weirdo from earlier?

1:14:38.975 --> 1:14:43.730
I thought he was a thief!
My goodness!

1:14:43.855 --> 1:14:46.733
Hey, you haven't paid for the coffee!

1:14:47.734 --> 1:14:49.736
He got away. I need you.

1:14:50.862 --> 1:14:52.197
Get Angelo too.

1:14:52.822 --> 1:14:57.493
- What did my office say?
- Nothing yet. He hasn't called.

1:14:57.619 --> 1:14:59.746
Where the hell is he?

1:14:59.871 --> 1:15:01.706
Do they know he's one of my guys?

1:15:01.831 --> 1:15:05.168
Of course.
There's no reason for secrecy now.

1:15:05.293 --> 1:15:06.961
Secrecy, my ass!

1:15:07.086 --> 1:15:09.088
Even if he manages
to get away from the gang,

1:15:09.214 --> 1:15:11.049
the cops will kill him.

1:16:15.405 --> 1:16:16.656
Hold it.

1:16:18.324 --> 1:16:20.159
He's got to be around here.

1:16:22.412 --> 1:16:23.788
You go!

1:16:44.058 --> 1:16:47.312
- What's going on?
- I think he's got Luciano.

1:17:55.505 --> 1:17:57.757
He was a really tall guy
with a beard.

1:17:57.882 --> 1:17:59.801
And quite a good-looking man.

1:17:59.926 --> 1:18:03.012
But he had the eyes of a killer.
He grabbed my bag like this.

1:18:03.137 --> 1:18:05.556
You can still see the bruises…

1:20:29.492 --> 1:20:32.787
- That's not possible.
- It's urgent.

1:20:32.912 --> 1:20:35.331
I have to get this medicine
to a clinic in Tunis.

1:20:35.456 --> 1:20:39.710
- I need clearance from Customs.
- I understand. Please help me out.

1:20:39.835 --> 1:20:43.089
We can't let a woman die
for the sake of bureaucracy!

1:20:54.934 --> 1:20:58.145
That'll be Massimo.
He's on his way back.

1:20:59.272 --> 1:21:01.274
I bet he got him.

1:21:07.613 --> 1:21:10.366
- No fucking way!
- I know!

1:21:53.492 --> 1:21:56.329
These are medicinal products,
so be careful.

1:22:23.314 --> 1:22:26.609
… inaugurated in 217 AD
by the Emperor Caracalla…

1:22:27.443 --> 1:22:29.904
Hey! Watch out! Run!

1:23:02.103 --> 1:23:03.938
Watch out! Watch out!

1:24:13.090 --> 1:24:15.217
<i>The show's over, you bastard!</i>

1:24:17.428 --> 1:24:19.722
<i>This is your last show.</i>

1:24:20.890 --> 1:24:22.767
<i>The curtain is falling.</i>

1:24:36.572 --> 1:24:39.950
- What happened?
- That girl's been shot.

1:25:07.478 --> 1:25:11.524
This is him.
He drove off in a police car.

1:25:14.318 --> 1:25:15.778
Where would he go?

1:25:15.903 --> 1:25:18.113
I'm sorry for the hold-up, Mr. Leroy,

1:25:18.239 --> 1:25:22.076
but I thought we were heading to Milan
not to Tunisia.

1:25:22.201 --> 1:25:24.411
A sudden change of plans.

1:25:24.537 --> 1:25:28.040
- But you're always the best.
- Thank you, Mr. Leroy.

1:25:34.964 --> 1:25:36.382
Who's that?

1:25:36.507 --> 1:25:39.385
Call headquarters.
It must be that guy.

1:25:39.510 --> 1:25:41.595
<i>Control tower to B-64.</i>

1:25:43.222 --> 1:25:45.516
Control tower to B-64.

1:25:46.350 --> 1:25:49.353
- Do you read me, B-64?
<i>- This is B-64.</i>

1:25:49.478 --> 1:25:52.773
I read you. I read you.

1:25:53.774 --> 1:25:57.528
- How was the flight?
- It needs a little TLC.

1:26:47.036 --> 1:26:49.580
- Where's he going?
- Hey, stop!

1:26:49.705 --> 1:26:51.415
I'll call the tower!

1:26:53.459 --> 1:26:57.087
Albatross-9, Albatross-9,
you are not cleared for take-off.

1:26:57.212 --> 1:26:59.757
You are not cleared for take-off.
Who is that?

1:27:40.714 --> 1:27:42.091
You bastard.

1:28:32.099 --> 1:28:33.934
Son of a bitch.

1:31:35.866 --> 1:31:36.867
Damn!

1:31:49.421 --> 1:31:52.883
- Albatross-9, come in.
- Yes.

1:31:53.008 --> 1:31:54.468
We've got him.

1:31:54.593 --> 1:31:57.137
- Fabio, are you alright?
- The bad guy's dead.

1:31:58.764 --> 1:32:02.351
Yeah. Who's to say who the bad guys are,
though? The good guys?

1:32:02.476 --> 1:32:04.311
And who's to say
who the good guys are?

1:32:04.937 --> 1:32:06.855
I hadn't thought of that.

1:32:06.980 --> 1:32:10.776
- Christ!
- For once, don't involve him!
