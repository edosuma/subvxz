19:37.635 --> 19:39.637
DEAN:
Of course.

19:39.888 --> 19:42.682
All these people kept coming
with, like, casseroles.

19:42.932 --> 19:45.518
I finally had to tell them all
to go away.

19:45.602 --> 19:48.605
You know, because nothing says
"I'm sorry" like tuna casserole.

20:02.619 --> 20:05.622
-How you holding up?
-I'm okay.

20:06.789 --> 20:10.043
Your dad and your uncle were close?

20:10.793 --> 20:12.754
Yeah, I guess.
I mean, they were brothers.

20:13.630 --> 20:16.007
They used to hang out
all the time when I was little.

20:16.215 --> 20:19.761
-But not lately, much?
-No, it's not that. It's just--

20:19.969 --> 20:21.846
We used to be neighbors
when I was a kid.

20:22.096 --> 20:23.890
We lived across town
in this house...

20:24.098 --> 20:27.685
...and Uncle Roger lived next door,
so he was over all the time.

20:27.769 --> 20:29.312
SAM:
Right.

20:30.104 --> 20:33.691
So how was it in that house,
when you were a kid?

20:34.943 --> 20:36.569
MAX:
It was fine.

20:37.654 --> 20:40.823
-Why?
-All good memories?

20:41.658 --> 20:44.243
DEAN:
Do you remember anything unusual?

20:44.452 --> 20:47.246
Something involving your father
and your uncle, maybe?

20:49.958 --> 20:53.628
Why do you--? Why do you ask?

20:56.255 --> 20:57.632
Just a question.

21:00.259 --> 21:04.097
No. There was nothing.
We were totally normal.

21:05.473 --> 21:07.058
-Happy.
-Good.

21:09.435 --> 21:11.104
That's good.

21:12.605 --> 21:15.650
Well, you must be exhausted.
We should take off.

21:15.733 --> 21:19.862
Right. Yeah. Thanks.

21:20.446 --> 21:21.823
Yeah.

21:25.868 --> 21:28.538
Nobody's family is
totally normal and happy.

21:28.746 --> 21:30.581
See when he was talking
about his house?

21:30.665 --> 21:32.625
He sounded scared.

21:32.709 --> 21:36.504
Max isn't telling us everything.
I say we go find the old neighborhood.

21:36.713 --> 21:39.382
Find out what life was really like
for the Millers.

21:43.678 --> 21:47.140
-You lived in the neighborhood long?
-Well, almost 20 years now.

21:47.348 --> 21:49.642
It's nice and quiet.
Why? You looking to buy?

21:49.892 --> 21:52.687
No. We were just wondering
if you might recall a family...

21:52.770 --> 21:55.314
...that used to live
right across the street.

21:55.523 --> 21:57.692
The Millers.
They had a little boy named Max.

21:57.900 --> 21:59.318
Right.

22:00.028 --> 22:03.781
Yeah, I remember them.
The brother had the place next door.

22:04.782 --> 22:08.119
So, what's this about?
That poor kid okay?

22:08.911 --> 22:10.788
What do you mean?

22:11.372 --> 22:13.791
In my life, I've never
seen a child treated like that.

22:14.542 --> 22:18.337
I mean, I'd hear Mr. Miller yelling and
throwing things clear across the street.

22:18.546 --> 22:20.882
He was a mean drunk.

22:21.090 --> 22:22.800
He used to beat the tar out of Max.

22:22.884 --> 22:26.179
Bruises. Broke his arm
two times that I know of.

22:26.721 --> 22:28.681
And this was going on regularly?

22:29.307 --> 22:30.767
Practically every day.

22:30.975 --> 22:34.687
In fact, that thug brother of his was
just as likely to take a swing at him.

22:34.771 --> 22:37.690
But the worst part
was the stepmother.

22:38.316 --> 22:39.734
She'd just...

22:40.568 --> 22:43.696
...stand there, checked out.
Never lifted a finger to protect him.

22:43.780 --> 22:47.408
I must have called the police seven
or eight times. Never did any good.

22:47.617 --> 22:50.703
-You said stepmother.
-I think his real mom died.

22:50.787 --> 22:54.916
Some sort of accident.
Car accident, I think.

22:55.124 --> 22:57.001

23:20.441 --> 23:22.944
-You know I never did anything.
MAX: That's right.

23:23.986 --> 23:25.780
You didn't do anything.

23:27.990 --> 23:30.368
You didn't stop them. Not once.

23:31.953 --> 23:33.996

Max is doing it.

24:22.670 --> 24:24.463
Everything I've been seeing.

24:24.672 --> 24:27.925
-You're sure about this?
-Yeah, I saw him.

24:28.134 --> 24:30.887
-How's he pulling it off?
-It looked like telekinesis.

24:30.970 --> 24:34.098
-He's psychic? He's a spoon bender?
-I didn't even realize it...

24:34.307 --> 24:37.977
...but this whole time he was there.
Outside the garage when his dad died.

24:38.186 --> 24:40.313
He was in the apartment
when his uncle died.

24:40.521 --> 24:45.818
These visions. I wasn't connecting
to the Millers, I was connecting to Max.

24:46.068 --> 24:50.114
The thing I don't get is why, man.
I guess, because we're so alike?

24:50.323 --> 24:52.700
What? He's nothing like you.

24:52.909 --> 24:55.328
Well, we both have psychic abilities.

24:55.536 --> 24:57.079
-We're both--
-Both what?

24:57.997 --> 25:01.042
He's a monster. He's killed two
and he's gunning for a third.

25:01.125 --> 25:03.628
Well, with what he went
through, the beatings...

25:03.836 --> 25:07.715
...to want revenge on those people,
I hate to say it, but it's not that insane.

25:07.924 --> 25:10.593
-It doesn't justify murdering your family.
-Dean--

25:10.801 --> 25:14.972
He's no different than anything else
we've hunted. We gotta end him.

25:15.806 --> 25:18.017
We're not going to kill Max.

25:18.226 --> 25:21.312
Then what? Hand him over to the cops
and say, "Lock him up, officer.

25:21.520 --> 25:23.981
-He kills with the power of his mind"?
-Forget it.

25:24.190 --> 25:25.858
-No way, man. Dean.
-Sam--

25:26.567 --> 25:28.027
He's a person.

25:28.236 --> 25:33.157
We can talk to him. Hey, promise me
you'll follow my lead on this one.

25:34.158 --> 25:35.868
All right, fine.

25:36.118 --> 25:38.371
But I'm not letting him
hurt anybody else.

25:49.006 --> 25:51.050
You know I never did anything.

Sorry to interrupt.

26:09.652 --> 26:11.487
Max, could we...?

26:11.696 --> 26:15.074
Could we talk to you outside
for just one second?

26:17.034 --> 26:18.411
About what?

26:19.203 --> 26:21.080
It's-- It's private.

26:21.289 --> 26:23.374
I wouldn't want to bother
your mother with it.

26:23.582 --> 26:26.544
We won't be long at all, though.
I promise.

-Great.

-Shut up.

27:11.922 --> 27:13.132
What are you doing?

27:15.843 --> 27:18.471
-I said, shut up!
-Max, calm down!

27:18.679 --> 27:20.931
-Who are you?
-We just wanna talk to you.

27:21.140 --> 27:23.893
-Right. That's why you brought this.
-That was a mistake.

27:24.101 --> 27:27.146
So was lying about who we were.
But no more lying, okay?

27:27.355 --> 27:30.983
-Just, please, just hear me out.
-About what?

27:31.984 --> 27:33.903
I saw you do it.

27:34.487 --> 27:37.740
I saw you kill your dad and your uncle.
Before it happened.

27:38.657 --> 27:40.284
-What?
-I'm having visions, Max.

27:40.493 --> 27:43.162
-About you.
-You're crazy.

27:44.330 --> 27:47.541
So you weren't gonna launch a knife
at your stepmom? Right here?

27:47.750 --> 27:50.169
Is it that hard to believe, Max?
Look what you can do.

27:50.378 --> 27:53.005
Max, I was drawn here, all right?

27:53.881 --> 27:55.383
I think I'm here to help you.

27:59.762 --> 28:01.722
No one can help me.

28:02.181 --> 28:06.102
Let me try. We'll just talk, me and you.

28:06.185 --> 28:08.479
We'll get Dean and Alice out of here.

28:08.687 --> 28:10.314
DEAN:
Uh-uh. No way.

28:11.357 --> 28:13.234
Nobody leaves this house.

28:13.317 --> 28:17.113
And nobody has to, all right?
They'll just-- They'll just go upstairs.

28:17.196 --> 28:19.990
-I'm not leaving you alone with him.
-Yes, you are.

28:20.199 --> 28:24.286
Look, Max. You're in charge here,
all right? We all know that.

28:24.745 --> 28:28.416
No one's gonna do anything you don't
wanna do. I'm talking five minutes, here.

28:28.666 --> 28:30.167
DEAN:
Sam!

28:32.962 --> 28:34.797
Five minutes.

28:36.382 --> 28:38.217
Go.

28:50.438 --> 28:51.939
Come on.

28:56.402 --> 29:00.239
Look, I can't begin to understand
what you went through.

29:00.448 --> 29:02.199
-That's right, you can't.
-But, Max.

29:03.159 --> 29:05.453
-This has to stop.
-It will.

29:05.703 --> 29:08.164
-After my stepmother.
-No.

29:08.372 --> 29:11.250
-You need to let her go.
-Why?

29:12.877 --> 29:16.046
-Did she beat you?
-No.

29:16.255 --> 29:19.425
But she never tried to save me.
She's a part of it too.

29:22.261 --> 29:27.766
Look, what they did to you,
what they all did to you growing up....

29:27.975 --> 29:30.436
-They deserve to be punished.
-Growing up?

29:31.562 --> 29:33.397
Try last week.

29:39.904 --> 29:44.617
My dad still hit me.
Just in places people wouldn't see it.

29:46.452 --> 29:49.246
Old habits die hard, I guess.

29:53.417 --> 29:55.044
I'm sorry.

30:00.674 --> 30:04.595
When I first found out
I could move things...

30:04.803 --> 30:07.139
...it was a gift.

30:07.431 --> 30:10.309
My whole life, I was helpless.

30:11.268 --> 30:12.811
But now I had this.

30:14.647 --> 30:19.235
So last week, Dad gets drunk.

30:19.443 --> 30:21.403
First time in a long time.

30:21.612 --> 30:26.659
And he beats me to hell,
first time in a long time.

30:27.284 --> 30:29.245
And then I knew what I had to do.

30:30.663 --> 30:34.083
-Why didn't you just leave?
-It wasn't about getting away.

30:36.502 --> 30:38.504
Just knowing that
they'd still be out there.

30:40.798 --> 30:45.177
It was about not being afraid.

30:47.555 --> 30:49.932
When my Dad used to look at me...

30:50.140 --> 30:52.977
...there was hate in his eyes.

30:53.185 --> 30:55.104
Do you know what that feels like?

30:58.691 --> 31:02.278
-No.
-He blamed me for everything.

31:02.486 --> 31:05.656
For his job. For his life.

31:06.448 --> 31:09.118
For my mom's death.

31:09.326 --> 31:11.537
Why would he blame you
for your mom's death?

31:15.207 --> 31:19.837
Because she died in my nursery,
while I was asleep in my crib.

31:20.504 --> 31:22.381
As if that makes it my fault.

31:24.758 --> 31:27.761
-She died in your nursery?
-Yeah.

31:27.970 --> 31:29.680
There was a fire.

31:29.888 --> 31:34.727
And he'd get drunk and babble on
like she died in some insane way.

31:34.935 --> 31:37.479
He said that she burned up.

31:37.563 --> 31:39.023
Pinned to the ceiling.

31:46.113 --> 31:47.781
Listen to me, Max.

31:48.616 --> 31:51.869
What your dad said about
what happened to your mom...

31:54.038 --> 31:55.539
...it's real.

31:57.124 --> 31:58.876
What?

31:59.126 --> 32:02.421
It happened to my mom too.
Exactly the same.

32:02.630 --> 32:04.798
My nursery. My crib.

32:05.007 --> 32:06.592
My dad saw her on the ceiling.

32:08.469 --> 32:10.346
Your dad must've been
as drunk as mine.

32:10.554 --> 32:15.309
No, no. It's the same thing, Max.
The same thing killed our mothers.

32:15.517 --> 32:16.977
That's not possible.

32:18.562 --> 32:21.690
This must be why I've been
having visions during the day.

32:22.399 --> 32:24.568
Why they're getting more intense.

32:25.194 --> 32:28.280
Because you and I must
be connected in some way.

32:28.489 --> 32:32.993
Your abilities, they started six, seven
months ago, right? Out of the blue?

32:33.535 --> 32:36.455
-How'd you know that?
-Because that's when mine started.

32:36.538 --> 32:41.335
Yours seem to be much further along,
but still, this means something, right?

32:41.418 --> 32:43.462
I mean, for some reason, you and I....

32:44.463 --> 32:46.507
You and I were chosen.

32:48.217 --> 32:50.010
For what?

32:51.303 --> 32:52.846
I don't know.

32:54.014 --> 32:57.810
But Dean and I, my brother and I,
we're hunting for your mom's killer.

32:58.018 --> 33:02.272
And we could find answers,
answers that can help us both.

33:02.481 --> 33:05.067
But you gotta let us go, Max.

33:05.442 --> 33:07.444
You gotta let your stepmother go.

33:21.625 --> 33:23.460
No.

33:23.752 --> 33:26.588
What they did to me....

33:27.256 --> 33:29.675
I still have nightmares.

33:29.883 --> 33:35.055
I'm still scared all the time, like
I'm just waiting for that next beating.

33:35.264 --> 33:38.767
I'm just tired of being scared.
If I do this, it'll be over.

33:38.976 --> 33:40.519
No, don't you get it?

33:40.728 --> 33:45.399
It won't. The nightmares
won't end, Max. Not like this.

33:45.482 --> 33:46.942
It's just...

33:47.151 --> 33:49.403
...more pain.

33:49.653 --> 33:52.114
And it makes you as bad as them.

33:53.240 --> 33:54.700
Max...

33:55.784 --> 33:58.537
...you don't have to go through
all this by yourself.

35:07.439 --> 35:09.191
Stay back.

35:10.067 --> 35:11.485
It's not about you.

35:11.568 --> 35:14.822
You wanna kill her,
you gotta go through me first.

35:16.240 --> 35:17.658
Okay.

35:30.546 --> 35:32.506
(GROANING)

35:36.468 --> 35:37.886
No.

35:38.512 --> 35:41.390
No! Ah!

35:51.608 --> 35:53.235
ALICE:
Max.

35:54.361 --> 35:55.904
No.

35:56.655 --> 35:58.240
Stay back.

35:58.782 --> 36:00.576
It's not about you.

36:00.784 --> 36:03.745
You're gonna kill her,
you gotta go through me first.

36:04.788 --> 36:06.206
Okay.

36:08.625 --> 36:11.420
No, don't! Don't! Please.

36:11.628 --> 36:12.880
Please, Max.

36:14.756 --> 36:15.924
Max...

36:16.133 --> 36:18.802
...we can help you, all right?

36:19.011 --> 36:21.263
But this, what you're doing...

36:21.805 --> 36:23.390
...it's not the solution.

36:24.099 --> 36:26.393
It's not gonna fix anything.

36:37.487 --> 36:38.822
You're right.

36:42.659 --> 36:44.244
No!

36:55.130 --> 36:57.257
Max attacked me.

36:57.466 --> 37:00.344
He threatened me with a gun.

37:01.219 --> 37:02.930
OFFICER:
And these two?

37:04.973 --> 37:06.433
ALICE:
They're...

37:07.100 --> 37:08.477
...family friends.

37:10.479 --> 37:14.691
I called them as soon
as Max arrived. I was scared.

37:15.150 --> 37:19.988
They tried to stop him.
They fought for the gun.

37:20.364 --> 37:22.741
Where did Max get the gun?

37:25.369 --> 37:27.079
I don't know.

37:27.162 --> 37:31.375
He showed up with it, and he....

37:35.253 --> 37:37.506
OFFICER:
It's all right, Mrs. Miller.

37:38.882 --> 37:41.927
I've lost everyone.

37:43.470 --> 37:44.888
OFFICER:
Okay.

37:45.347 --> 37:49.309
-We'll call if we have more questions.
-Thanks, officer.

37:49.893 --> 37:51.395
Come on.

38:04.116 --> 38:06.326
If I'd just said something else....

38:06.535 --> 38:09.121
-Gotten through to him somehow.
-Oh, don't do that.

38:09.204 --> 38:11.415
-Do what?
-Torture yourself.

38:11.665 --> 38:14.001
It wouldn't have mattered.
Max was too far gone.

38:14.209 --> 38:17.254
When I think about how he looked
at me, man, right before....

38:17.337 --> 38:20.924
-I should have done something.
-Come on, man. You risked your life.

38:21.133 --> 38:24.219
I mean, yeah, maybe if we'd
gotten there 20 years earlier.

38:24.845 --> 38:25.971
(SIGHS)

38:26.304 --> 38:27.973
Well, I'll tell you one thing.

38:28.181 --> 38:29.349
We're lucky we had Dad.

38:33.020 --> 38:35.230
I never thought I'd hear you say that.

38:36.773 --> 38:40.235
Well, he could have gone
a whole other way after Mom.

38:40.610 --> 38:45.615
A little more tequila,
a little less demon hunting...

38:46.199 --> 38:48.326
...then we would have
had Max's childhood.

38:50.704 --> 38:52.247
All things considered...

38:52.456 --> 38:55.167
...we turned out okay.

38:55.459 --> 38:57.335
Thanks to him.

39:01.423 --> 39:03.633
All things considered.

39:12.893 --> 39:15.353
-Dean, I've been thinking.
-That's never a good thing.

39:15.562 --> 39:16.980
I'm serious.

39:17.189 --> 39:21.026
I've been thinking, why would
this demon, or whatever it is...

39:21.234 --> 39:24.863
...why would it kill Mom and Jessica
and Max's mother, you know?

39:25.072 --> 39:26.865
-What does it want?
-No idea.

39:27.074 --> 39:30.118
Well, you think maybe it was after us?

39:30.368 --> 39:33.497
-After Max and me?
-Why would you think that?

39:34.498 --> 39:37.793
I mean, either telekinesis
or premonitions...

39:38.001 --> 39:41.630
...we both had abilities, you know?
Maybe it was after us for some reason.

39:41.838 --> 39:44.674
Sam. If it wanted you,
it would've just taken you.

39:44.883 --> 39:47.677
Okay? This is not your fault.

39:47.886 --> 39:50.305
-It's not about you.
-Then what is it about?

39:51.431 --> 39:54.226
It's about that damn thing
that did this to our family.

39:54.434 --> 39:57.521
That thing that we're gonna find
and kill. And that's all.

40:00.273 --> 40:02.275
Actually, there's...

40:02.692 --> 40:04.444
...something else too.

40:05.487 --> 40:10.325
-Oh, jeez. What?
-When Max locked me in that closet...

40:10.617 --> 40:13.161
...with that big cabinet
against the door...

40:13.787 --> 40:15.247
...I moved it.

40:15.330 --> 40:16.414
(DEAN CHUCKLES)

40:16.665 --> 40:19.501
You got more upper-body strength
than I gave you credit for.

40:19.709 --> 40:24.506
No, man. I moved it. Like Max.

40:27.509 --> 40:28.927
Oh.

40:31.513 --> 40:32.681
Right.

40:32.931 --> 40:34.850
Yeah.

40:41.982 --> 40:43.650
Bend this.

40:44.359 --> 40:46.736
-I can't turn it on and off, Dean.
-How'd you do it?

40:46.945 --> 40:49.447
I don't know.
I can't control it. I just....

40:49.656 --> 40:52.993
I saw you die and it just came out
of me. Like a-- Like a punch.

40:53.201 --> 40:56.496
You know?
Like a freak adrenaline thing.

41:00.917 --> 41:03.336
Well, I'm sure it won't happen again.

41:05.547 --> 41:06.715
Yeah, maybe.

41:06.923 --> 41:10.135
Aren't you worried that I could
turn into Max or something?

41:10.844 --> 41:13.388
Nope. No way.

41:13.722 --> 41:16.391
-You know why?
-No. Why?

41:16.474 --> 41:20.520
-You've got one advantage Max didn't.
-Dad?

41:20.770 --> 41:22.480
Because Dad's not here, Dean.

41:22.731 --> 41:24.774
No.

41:25.483 --> 41:26.902
Me.

41:28.403 --> 41:32.115
As long as I'm around,
nothing bad is gonna happen to you.

41:34.534 --> 41:36.369
Now, then.

41:36.620 --> 41:39.122
I know what we need to do
about your premonitions.

41:39.331 --> 41:40.790
I know where we have to go.

41:41.041 --> 41:42.626
Where?

41:43.418 --> 41:45.545
Vegas.

41:49.633 --> 41:51.843
What? Come on, man.

41:52.052 --> 41:54.137
Craps tables? We'd clean up.
