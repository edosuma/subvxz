WEBVTT

00:02.919 --> 00:05.421
<i>First murder of the week</i>
<i>and in broad daylight.</i>

00:05.423 --> 00:07.473
I love this city.

00:08.675 --> 00:10.910
Hey.

00:10.912 --> 00:12.394
What are we looking at here?

00:12.396 --> 00:14.630
John Hudson,
39 years old.

00:14.632 --> 00:16.799
Took one in to the head,
one in the chest.

00:16.801 --> 00:18.901
Looks like a .45 casing,
partner.

00:18.903 --> 00:20.519
Any surveillance cameras?

00:20.521 --> 00:21.687
This ain't Times Square.

00:21.689 --> 00:23.405
What's with the jacket?

00:23.407 --> 00:26.191
Kid over there covered him.
Michael Hudson.

00:26.193 --> 00:27.376
He's the only witness.

00:27.378 --> 00:29.211
It's the victim's son.

00:32.198 --> 00:34.667
Hang tight.

00:40.023 --> 00:41.674
Michael?

00:42.893 --> 00:44.176
My name's Detective Reagan.

00:44.178 --> 00:47.062
This is my partner,
Detective Baez.

00:47.064 --> 00:48.480
We're here to help you.

00:48.482 --> 00:50.933
You gonna help get my dad back?

00:50.935 --> 00:54.186
Well, if you can
help us out here

00:54.188 --> 00:56.522
and tell us
what you saw,

00:56.524 --> 00:58.890
I give you my word
we'll do everything we can

00:58.892 --> 01:00.743
to find out who did this.

01:01.778 --> 01:03.529
Will you talk to us?

01:07.284 --> 01:10.336
We were walking home...

01:10.338 --> 01:13.789
through the park.

01:13.791 --> 01:16.292
And I saw this guy
walking towards us.

01:16.294 --> 01:20.429
And I saw he had a gun.

01:20.431 --> 01:22.848
And I guess my dad,

01:22.850 --> 01:24.266
he must have
seen it, too,

01:24.268 --> 01:26.669
because he pushed me
to the ground,

01:26.671 --> 01:30.189
and then I heard bam, bam, bam.

01:30.191 --> 01:31.941
What did he look like?

01:31.943 --> 01:33.976
Um, Spanish...

01:33.978 --> 01:37.029
in his 20s,

01:37.031 --> 01:38.063
skinny.

01:38.065 --> 01:40.432
Was he someone you recognized?

01:40.434 --> 01:43.485
No, but he had, like, a big
tattoo right here, of a gun.

01:43.487 --> 01:45.788
Michael, can you think
of anybody

01:45.790 --> 01:47.623
who would want to hurt your dad?

01:49.209 --> 01:52.878
Do you have
any other relatives?

01:53.747 --> 01:55.080
Yeah, my mom,

01:55.082 --> 01:57.967
but I don't want
to go home just yet.

01:57.969 --> 01:59.752
I just want to stay with him.

01:59.754 --> 02:01.003
Okay.

02:05.925 --> 02:07.793
Notify me after
the testimony, okay?

02:07.795 --> 02:09.445
Good luck.

02:09.447 --> 02:11.797
How'd your case go?

02:11.799 --> 02:13.515
Saw your name
on the calendar.

02:13.517 --> 02:14.516
Erin Reagan.

02:14.518 --> 02:16.402
You finally got rid
of "Boyle."

02:16.404 --> 02:18.253
Apparently not.

02:18.255 --> 02:19.688
Got a conviction.

02:19.690 --> 02:21.357
Congrats.

02:21.359 --> 02:23.258
You on your way
to court?

02:23.260 --> 02:26.028
Uh, yeah, I'm due
at a deposition,

02:26.030 --> 02:29.415
but I wanted to let you know
that I got Nicky tickets

02:29.417 --> 02:31.450
to that concert at the
Garden on Sunday night.

02:31.452 --> 02:33.769
Did you already tell her?
Yeah.

02:33.771 --> 02:34.837
She's thrilled.

02:34.839 --> 02:36.588
And she wants to bring Melissa,
and she wants

02:36.590 --> 02:38.240
to have a sleepover afterwards
at her house.

02:38.242 --> 02:40.993
I figured that's
not a problem, right?

02:40.995 --> 02:42.828
Was I wrong?

02:42.830 --> 02:45.848
I just wish you would
check in with me

02:45.850 --> 02:47.149
about these things, Jack, okay?

02:47.151 --> 02:48.334
'Cause I already got her
tickets,

02:48.336 --> 02:50.252
and it was supposed
to be a surprise.

02:50.254 --> 02:52.271
Okay.

02:52.273 --> 02:54.005
So she can bring
some more friends.

02:54.007 --> 02:56.475
Jack...

02:56.477 --> 02:57.559
Forget it.

02:57.561 --> 02:59.478
You know what, actually?

02:59.480 --> 03:01.030
Do me a favor.

03:01.032 --> 03:03.532
Make me a list. I'll put it
on my refrigerator door.

03:03.534 --> 03:05.284
Things Jack Could Do Right.

03:10.189 --> 03:12.291
Yep, sounds good.

03:16.246 --> 03:17.963
Ma'am.
Thank you.

03:17.965 --> 03:21.216
Okay, so why don't you
just give me a call later

03:21.218 --> 03:24.086
and, uh, we'll
pick a place?

03:26.172 --> 03:27.723
A hot date?

03:27.725 --> 03:29.975
Nope, just a guy
from my Academy class.

03:29.977 --> 03:31.209
Oh, not a date?

03:31.211 --> 03:34.730
I don't know.
What makes it a date?

03:34.732 --> 03:36.832
Premeditation?
Intent?

03:36.834 --> 03:38.834
The suspect was wearing
cool shoes

03:38.836 --> 03:40.069
and his best cologne?

03:42.873 --> 03:44.273
Oh...

03:44.275 --> 03:45.574
Call it in!

03:45.576 --> 03:47.058
12 David to Central.

03:47.060 --> 03:48.994
We have a 53
at DeKalb and Court.

03:48.996 --> 03:51.196
Request a bus
forthwith.

03:51.198 --> 03:53.332
Mommy! Mommy, are you okay?

03:53.334 --> 03:55.451
- Ma'am, ma'am, can you hear me?
- Help my mom!

03:55.453 --> 03:57.536
My son, my son is in the back!

03:57.538 --> 03:58.504
Is she okay?
Okay. What's his name?

03:58.506 --> 03:59.621
Ryan!

03:59.623 --> 04:01.072
Okay, stay calm.
Is my mom okay?

04:01.074 --> 04:02.207
Try not to move.

04:02.209 --> 04:04.543
Try not to move, okay?
Look at me. Look at me!

04:04.545 --> 04:06.077
It's okay.
We're gonna help your boy,

04:06.079 --> 04:07.129
we're gonna help you.

04:07.131 --> 04:08.630
Mommy! Mom!
I can't get it!

04:08.632 --> 04:10.549
What's going on?!
Hey, Ryan. Hey.

04:10.551 --> 04:12.618
I'm Officer Reagan. I'm gonna
get you out of there, okay?

04:12.620 --> 04:14.803
How's my mom?
She's gonna be okay.

04:14.805 --> 04:16.254
Listen, Ryan, I'm gonna
break the glass.

04:16.255 --> 04:18.490
I want you to cover your face, okay?
Oh, no.

04:18.492 --> 04:19.641
Cover your face!

04:24.531 --> 04:28.484
Hey, Ryan, I'm gonna
get you out of here, okay?

04:28.486 --> 04:29.868
It's okay.
Okay.

04:29.870 --> 04:32.154
Is my mommy okay?

04:32.156 --> 04:34.105
We'll check on your
mom right now.

04:34.107 --> 04:36.792
All right, just lay down
right here, okay? Don't move.

04:36.794 --> 04:40.129
We're gonna have the paramedics
take a look at you, okay?

04:45.168 --> 04:46.668
Hey, you put that
description out?

04:46.670 --> 04:48.119
Nothing yet.

04:48.121 --> 04:49.555
What about the gun tattoo?

04:49.557 --> 04:51.456
I searched BADS. Nothing popped.

04:51.458 --> 04:53.475
All right. Riker's has their own
Gang Intel database.

04:53.477 --> 04:55.778
Tap that and see what comes up.

05:00.467 --> 05:04.135
Here we go. Gun tattoo
on the right side of his neck.

05:04.137 --> 05:07.806
Raul Delgado.
Six feet, 170 pounds.

05:07.808 --> 05:09.441
Okay, so far, so good.

05:09.443 --> 05:11.476
In 2009, he was arrested
for assault.

05:11.478 --> 05:13.662
Got convicted, served two years.

05:13.664 --> 05:17.616
2011, he was collared for murder.
Was he acquitted?

05:17.618 --> 05:19.835
He was found guilty,
sentenced 15 to 25.

05:19.837 --> 05:21.620
That means he couldn't
be our guy.

05:21.622 --> 05:22.588
He's in prison.

05:22.590 --> 05:24.122
Supposed to be.

05:24.124 --> 05:27.092
But according to these records,
he's not.

05:27.094 --> 05:30.879
Was it retrial,
out on bail, what?

05:30.881 --> 05:32.047
None of the above.

05:32.049 --> 05:34.883
He literally just disappeared
from the system.

05:38.771 --> 05:39.888
You're gonna go
in the ambulance

05:39.890 --> 05:40.939
with your mom,
okay, Ryan?

05:40.941 --> 05:42.257
All right.

05:42.259 --> 05:45.294
Ryan's right behind you,
all right?

05:45.296 --> 05:47.329
He's coming up right behind you.
You're okay.

05:47.331 --> 05:48.397
Officer Reagan.

05:48.399 --> 05:49.998
How many hurt?

05:50.000 --> 05:52.451
Two. We have
a 35-year-old female

05:52.453 --> 05:53.735
and her son,
eight years old.

05:53.737 --> 05:56.038
The driver of the truck
is about 50. He's fine.

05:56.040 --> 05:57.539
Either driver make any statements?
No.

05:57.541 --> 05:59.791
Officer Reagan, you coming?

05:59.793 --> 06:01.159
I'm coming with you, Ryan.

06:01.161 --> 06:02.794
The kid's really upset,
his mother's in shock.

06:02.796 --> 06:04.362
I'm gonna go with him
to the hospital.

06:04.364 --> 06:06.131
No, you have to prepare
the accident report.

06:06.133 --> 06:07.850
I can prepare the report, boss.

06:07.852 --> 06:09.818
You will stay out of this,
Officer Janko.

06:09.820 --> 06:10.919
You're the senior officer.

06:10.921 --> 06:12.137
Boss, there's other members
who can...

06:12.139 --> 06:13.589
Well, you were first
on the scene.

06:13.591 --> 06:16.642
You're coming with me, right?!
What's going on?

06:16.644 --> 06:18.560
This is all on me.

06:18.562 --> 06:20.545
Where are you going?

06:20.547 --> 06:21.847
You know where I'm going.

06:21.849 --> 06:23.065
I'll check in
with you later.

06:23.067 --> 06:24.733
I don't give a damn
what your nameplate says.

06:24.735 --> 06:25.851
I'm giving you a direct order.

06:25.853 --> 06:27.886
You leave here, you
disobey a lawful order.

06:27.888 --> 06:29.220
I'll have your shield.

06:29.222 --> 06:30.539
You know where to find me.

06:38.781 --> 06:40.198
You're gonna sit there
and tell me

06:40.200 --> 06:41.366
that the Surveillance Program

06:41.368 --> 06:43.869
doesn't violate civil liberties?
Seriously?!

06:43.871 --> 06:46.571
Seriously! It's helped stop
14 terrorist plots

06:46.573 --> 06:48.573
against this city since 9/11.

06:48.575 --> 06:50.408
You can't just stand
behind 9/11!

06:50.410 --> 06:51.793
You don't tell me
where to stand!

06:51.795 --> 06:54.346
2,000 security cameras around
New York City, license plate...

06:54.348 --> 06:56.548
In service of the public safety.
Overkill.

06:56.550 --> 06:58.133
- Vigilant.
- Time out.

06:58.135 --> 07:01.086
Uh, "Don't tell me
where to stand"

07:01.088 --> 07:03.605
sounds like, uh, "You
can't handle the truth."

07:03.607 --> 07:05.390
We don't want to sound
patronizing.

07:05.392 --> 07:06.909
Well, she started it!

07:06.911 --> 07:08.860
And so will Reverend Potter on
the broadcast.

07:08.862 --> 07:10.145
Don't take the bait.

07:10.147 --> 07:12.147
Over a million ears will be
listening in.

07:12.149 --> 07:13.398
Let's secure the high road.

07:13.400 --> 07:14.633
This is stupid.

07:14.635 --> 07:15.851
Thank you, Baker.

07:15.853 --> 07:17.986
Excellent work.
Same time tomorrow?

07:17.988 --> 07:19.821
Think you can you handle
another round?

07:19.823 --> 07:21.039
Better eat your spinach.

07:25.778 --> 07:28.497
And you don't know
what this is about, do you?

07:28.499 --> 07:30.666
It's Homeland Security, Frank.

07:30.668 --> 07:32.968
They're not real big on sharing
the particulars.

07:32.970 --> 07:35.504
But I do know it involves that
murder in Washington Heights,

07:35.506 --> 07:37.422
the guy in front of his kid?

07:39.342 --> 07:41.176
Okay.

07:44.514 --> 07:45.631
Gentlemen.

07:45.633 --> 07:47.349
Commissioner.

07:47.351 --> 07:49.651
Please, sit down.

07:49.653 --> 07:52.804
I'm Deputy Director Tom Mason,

07:52.806 --> 07:55.674
this is Agent Richard Keller,

07:55.676 --> 07:58.577
Homeland Security
Investigations.

07:58.579 --> 08:00.362
We're here about
the John Hudson murder.

08:00.364 --> 08:02.414
Why is Homeland Security
interested

08:02.416 --> 08:04.583
in a hit in Washington Heights?

08:07.170 --> 08:08.286
We have information

08:08.288 --> 08:11.340
that Raul Delgado is a suspect
in the case.

08:11.342 --> 08:13.058
We own him.

08:14.794 --> 08:18.463
Well, we always try to cooperate
with your agency

08:18.465 --> 08:20.132
as much as we possibly can.

08:20.134 --> 08:21.499
I know.

08:21.501 --> 08:24.169
That's why I'm here, to ask you

08:24.171 --> 08:27.572
to order your detectives
to back off.

Hey.

09:03.570 --> 09:04.719
Thanks for coming.

09:04.721 --> 09:07.055
Well, you said
you were buying.

09:07.057 --> 09:08.489
Ginger ale, wedge of lime.

09:08.491 --> 09:09.724
Yes, sir.

09:09.726 --> 09:11.759
What's that all about?

09:11.761 --> 09:13.928
You might want
to go back to work.

09:13.930 --> 09:16.364
I just came off a 12-hour tour
chasing my tail.

09:16.366 --> 09:19.200
On what?

09:19.202 --> 09:22.453
The hit in Washington Heights.

09:22.455 --> 09:24.372
I got a suspect
whose last known address

09:24.374 --> 09:26.541
is five years old,
no cell phone, no family.

09:26.543 --> 09:28.743
Named Raul Delgado.

09:28.745 --> 09:31.529
Yeah. How'd you know?

09:32.748 --> 09:33.914
Let me rephrase.

09:33.916 --> 09:35.767
He's a confidential informant

09:35.769 --> 09:37.468
for Homeland Security.

09:37.470 --> 09:41.022
That would explains how
he disappeared from the system.

09:41.024 --> 09:43.391
How's this guy get
a pass on murder?

09:43.393 --> 09:46.477
He's been feeding 'em
intel on a drug organization

09:46.479 --> 09:50.198
they think funnels money
to an overseas terror cell.

09:50.200 --> 09:52.266
They "think"?
It's Homeland Security.

09:52.268 --> 09:54.402
They're not real big on sharing
the particulars.

09:54.404 --> 09:57.372
Okay, so am I supposed
to back off this thing?

09:57.374 --> 10:00.274
You like Delgado for this?

10:00.276 --> 10:01.609
Yes.

10:01.611 --> 10:05.530
His last known associate's
a guy named Juan Lopez,

10:05.532 --> 10:07.815
doing time in Otisville
for armed robbery.

10:07.817 --> 10:09.050
Okay. Thanks.

10:09.052 --> 10:10.952
Figure out how
you found that out.

10:10.954 --> 10:13.371
Copy that.

10:19.795 --> 10:22.814
Great. Thanks for your
cooperation.

10:22.816 --> 10:24.482
You ready to go,
partner?

10:24.484 --> 10:25.516
We're not going.

10:25.518 --> 10:27.101
What do you mean,
we're not going?

10:27.103 --> 10:29.153
I just got off the phone
with the warden.

10:29.155 --> 10:30.772
He transferred Lopez
about an hour ago.

10:30.774 --> 10:32.407
The guy agreed
to talk to us.

10:32.409 --> 10:34.158
Why the hell
would they move him?

10:34.160 --> 10:35.276
It's a federal prison.

10:35.278 --> 10:37.161
Apparently, the Feds can
move him around every day

10:37.163 --> 10:38.979
of the week if they want,
without any reason.

10:38.981 --> 10:41.249
All right, fine, fine.
Where'd they move him to?

10:41.251 --> 10:42.650
South Dakota.
South...?

10:45.587 --> 10:48.823
The show's host, Sean Martin,
will act as moderator.

10:48.825 --> 10:50.208
And how moderate is he?

10:50.210 --> 10:51.692
It's public radio.

10:51.694 --> 10:53.094
So not very. So it's him

10:53.096 --> 10:54.379
and Reverend Potter, two on one.

10:54.381 --> 10:56.664
You'll have a height
and reach advantage.

10:57.833 --> 10:59.767
Your Chief of Department wants
another word.

11:03.772 --> 11:04.956
Dino.

11:06.275 --> 11:08.476
I can make this go away.

11:08.478 --> 11:11.279
Why don't you give me
the headline first, Dino?

11:11.281 --> 11:14.014
Officer Reagan is facing
departmental charges

11:14.016 --> 11:16.918
and possible suspension for
disobeying a direct order

11:16.920 --> 11:18.453
from a superior officer

11:18.455 --> 11:20.371
at the scene of the accident.
I know.

11:20.373 --> 11:22.373
I could speak
with the lieutenant...

11:22.375 --> 11:23.825
No.

11:23.827 --> 11:25.993
You could certainly
make the case

11:25.995 --> 11:27.662
that it was in
the child's best interest

11:27.664 --> 11:29.046
for Officer Reagan
to accompany him

11:29.048 --> 11:30.314
to the hospital.

11:30.316 --> 11:33.267
But he did, in fact,
disobey a direct order.

11:33.269 --> 11:35.202
From a lieutenant
who was newly promoted,

11:35.204 --> 11:36.387
and he was feeling his oats.

11:36.389 --> 11:38.673
That fact sounds a lot
like opinion, Dino.

11:38.675 --> 11:40.007
Commissioner,
it was an ego trip.

11:40.009 --> 11:42.427
I spoke to everyone,
including the lieutenant.

11:42.429 --> 11:43.845
I know Jamie.

11:43.847 --> 11:45.213
So do I.

11:54.590 --> 11:55.606
What are you gonna do?

11:55.608 --> 11:57.325
It's insubordination.

11:57.327 --> 11:58.526
Do you really
want to read

11:58.528 --> 12:00.495
"Reagan to Son:
You're Grounded"?

12:00.497 --> 12:02.897
Better it's "Reagan to Son:
The Rules Don't Apply"?

12:02.899 --> 12:04.632
It's gonna leave a permanent
mark on his record, Frank.

12:04.634 --> 12:05.583
Garrett,

12:05.585 --> 12:07.251
I got 35,000 cops.

12:07.253 --> 12:09.287
Would you be saying this
if his name wasn't Reagan?

12:09.289 --> 12:11.022
So remind me:
What's the advantage

12:11.024 --> 12:12.507
to having your dad be the PC?

12:12.509 --> 12:13.758
I build character.

12:15.093 --> 12:16.911
Are we done here?

12:16.913 --> 12:19.630
Homeland Security
left three messages.

12:19.632 --> 12:21.415
Frank, are you disregarding
their request

12:21.417 --> 12:23.951
to back off the investigation
into Raul Delgado?

12:23.953 --> 12:25.970
I can neither
confirm nor deny

12:25.972 --> 12:26.988
that information.

12:26.990 --> 12:28.356
Well, what do you
want me to tell them?

12:28.358 --> 12:30.591
To leave a message
at the beep.

12:37.182 --> 12:38.649
Detectives,
I'm Agent Keller.

12:38.651 --> 12:40.201
What can I do for you?

12:40.203 --> 12:42.620
Raul Delgado.
He works for you?

12:43.789 --> 12:45.623
You're his handler.
Come on, we know.

12:45.625 --> 12:47.875
I'm sorry, I'm not at liberty
to discuss him with you.

12:47.877 --> 12:49.160
Well, he's wanted
for murder.

12:49.162 --> 12:50.611
Are you at liberty
to discuss that?

12:50.613 --> 12:52.330
And you made sure
his last known associate

12:52.332 --> 12:53.998
was transferred out
of Otisville prison

12:54.000 --> 12:55.166
before we could
speak to him.

12:55.168 --> 12:56.667
What are you implying?

12:56.669 --> 12:59.003
That you're protecting
a stone-cold killer.

12:59.005 --> 13:01.138
Now, what kind of cop
does that make you, huh?

13:01.140 --> 13:03.441
I'm the kind that
looks at the big picture.

13:03.443 --> 13:05.643
Oh.
We're about to take down

13:05.645 --> 13:07.562
a large-scale network
of terrorists.

13:07.564 --> 13:09.263
Without Delgado,
that will not happen.

13:09.265 --> 13:10.865
Look, Delgado
killed Hudson

13:10.867 --> 13:12.517
in front of his
13-year-old son.

13:12.519 --> 13:14.352
Nobody gets a pass
for that in this city.

13:14.354 --> 13:16.654
I don't need a pass from you.

13:16.656 --> 13:19.306
Call Washington
if you don't believe me.

13:19.308 --> 13:22.309
And stop interfering
in my operation.

13:29.651 --> 13:31.485
Chocolate dip, please.
Coming up.

13:33.171 --> 13:34.288
Hey.

13:34.290 --> 13:35.873
I'm buying.

13:35.875 --> 13:37.425
In exchange for what?

13:37.427 --> 13:39.210
In exchange for you getting
me around Homeland Security.

13:39.212 --> 13:40.828
- Thank you.
- Seriously?

13:40.830 --> 13:42.113
Yes.
Here you go, ma'am.

13:42.115 --> 13:43.781
Well, you need to start
with a shadier lawyer, then.

13:43.783 --> 13:45.633
Thank you.
Um, they got a CI,

13:45.635 --> 13:46.934
this Delgado guy.

13:46.936 --> 13:47.969
I like him for murder

13:47.971 --> 13:49.387
and they won't
let me get near him.

13:49.389 --> 13:50.805
You've collared
plenty of criminals

13:50.807 --> 13:52.690
without the help of
Homeland Security.

13:52.692 --> 13:54.859
Not ones with
their active protection.

13:54.861 --> 13:56.758
And you can't find Delgado
without them?

13:56.783 --> 13:57.563
No.

13:57.564 --> 14:00.231
He's off the grid, they wiped
him out of every database.

14:00.233 --> 14:01.399
His handler, this guy Keller,

14:01.401 --> 14:02.900
he doesn't want
to play ball, so...

14:02.902 --> 14:05.119
There's got to be something
you can do to help.

14:05.121 --> 14:06.854
I can't compel them
to cooperate.

14:06.856 --> 14:10.141
This guy is
withholding information

14:10.143 --> 14:11.609
in a murder investigation.

14:11.611 --> 14:13.578
Okay. What's his name again?

14:13.580 --> 14:14.962
Keller.
Right.

14:14.964 --> 14:17.197
Agent Keller
of Homeland Security

14:17.199 --> 14:19.383
has firewalls and
perimeters around him

14:19.385 --> 14:20.418
I can't see or touch.

14:20.420 --> 14:21.886
Great. Thank you.

14:21.888 --> 14:22.937
Enjoy your ice cream.

14:22.939 --> 14:25.790
However...

14:25.792 --> 14:27.675
he's also a U.S. citizen

14:27.677 --> 14:29.343
currently in your jurisdiction,

14:29.345 --> 14:32.263
and you believe he has
knowledge on the whereabouts

14:32.265 --> 14:34.348
of a prime suspect
in a murder case

14:34.350 --> 14:35.433
that you've been assigned to.

14:35.435 --> 14:37.051
Right.

14:37.053 --> 14:38.436
And, in all likelihood,

14:38.438 --> 14:40.738
he will cross paths
with that suspect

14:40.740 --> 14:42.106
while he's in my jurisdiction.

14:42.108 --> 14:43.891
Mm-hmm.

14:43.893 --> 14:45.726
Maybe I don't need
a shadier lawyer.

14:45.728 --> 14:47.345
You'll do just fine.

14:56.288 --> 14:59.674
Apartment 1F.
Let's move.

15:07.082 --> 15:08.099
Last door on the right.

15:08.101 --> 15:09.266
Let's go.

15:11.136 --> 15:12.553
Step aside, ma'am.

15:12.555 --> 15:13.738
He might be armed.

15:23.598 --> 15:25.783
Raul Delgado!

15:27.119 --> 15:29.787
Police! Open up!

15:32.958 --> 15:34.625
Go, go, go!

15:34.627 --> 15:35.576
Freeze!
Hold it!

15:35.578 --> 15:37.078
Hey!
Move, move, move!

15:37.080 --> 15:39.113
He's headed for
the back alley!

15:39.115 --> 15:40.998
Hey!
Officer in pursuit!

15:45.754 --> 15:47.371
Hold up!

15:52.060 --> 15:53.060
Come here!

15:55.014 --> 15:56.647
Settle down.
Get off me, man!

15:56.649 --> 15:57.682
All right...

15:59.318 --> 16:00.735
All right.

16:00.737 --> 16:01.802
You tailed me?

16:01.804 --> 16:03.020
It's not against
the law.

16:03.022 --> 16:04.188
I'm a federal agent.

16:04.190 --> 16:05.356
So?

16:05.358 --> 16:06.624
I thought we'd gotten past

16:06.626 --> 16:07.658
all the introductions.

16:07.660 --> 16:09.477
What do you think
you're doing?

16:09.479 --> 16:11.579
Arresting Raul Delgado
for the murder of John Hudson.

16:11.581 --> 16:12.997
You can't do that.

16:12.999 --> 16:14.865
Sure I can, it's in
our jurisdiction.

16:14.867 --> 16:18.819
So you, my friend,
can kiss my New York ass.

16:31.074 --> 16:33.292
"Reagan to Son:
You're Grounded!"

16:35.662 --> 16:37.246
You ought to get
royalties or something.

16:37.248 --> 16:38.581
I still don't see
the point of

16:38.583 --> 16:40.783
suspending him for a week
for being the kind of cop

16:40.785 --> 16:42.218
you'd put on your
recruiting poster.

16:42.220 --> 16:44.270
Are you ready for
Deputy Director Mason?

16:44.272 --> 16:45.838
No, but let's
have him anyway.

16:45.840 --> 16:46.772
Do you have any control

16:46.774 --> 16:48.257
over your men?
Excuse me.

16:48.259 --> 16:49.792
You can't just come in here...
I told you Delgado

16:49.794 --> 16:50.876
was working for us.

16:50.878 --> 16:52.795
I told you we needed him
for our operation.

16:52.797 --> 16:54.347
Murder is a deal breaker.

16:54.349 --> 16:56.265
If Delgado's taken
off the streets,

16:56.267 --> 16:58.651
we lose our ability to track
what these guys are doing.

16:58.653 --> 17:01.103
And if we end up with
a compromised operation,

17:01.105 --> 17:02.755
the blood will be
on your hands.

17:02.757 --> 17:04.757
And whose hands
is Mr. Hudson's blood on?

17:04.759 --> 17:05.891
Collateral damage.

17:05.893 --> 17:06.992
Don't give me that.

17:06.993 --> 17:08.477
That's just spin
for bad planning.

17:09.378 --> 17:11.096
You don't send my detectives

17:11.098 --> 17:12.263
chasing their tail

17:12.266 --> 17:15.267
in order to hide
a murderer in my city.

17:15.269 --> 17:17.036
You know where the door is.

17:25.912 --> 17:27.079
Were any guns recovered?

17:27.080 --> 17:28.164
No.

17:28.165 --> 17:29.665
So we still don't have
a murder weapon.

17:29.667 --> 17:30.800
Yeah, but we got
an eyewitness.

17:30.802 --> 17:32.301
Hi.
Erin.

17:32.303 --> 17:34.170
Danny.
Jack.

17:34.172 --> 17:35.337
Jack Boyle.

17:35.339 --> 17:36.338
What are you doing here?

17:36.340 --> 17:37.456
Here to see my client.

17:37.458 --> 17:38.891
Who's that?

17:38.893 --> 17:40.810
Raul Delgado.
You're joking, right?

17:40.812 --> 17:42.845
You're representing Raul Delgado?
Okay...

17:42.847 --> 17:44.814
Are you kidding?
Excuse me.

17:44.816 --> 17:46.565
Let's go, okay?

17:49.403 --> 17:51.470
My firm has a deal
with the Feds.

17:51.472 --> 17:53.189
It's an assigned case.

17:54.691 --> 17:57.159
Bringing in six men
for you to take a look at, Michael.

17:57.161 --> 17:59.078
See if you can
recognize one of them.

18:01.998 --> 18:03.332
But I got to be
honest with you,

18:03.334 --> 18:04.450
I'm having a pretty hard
time figuring out

18:04.452 --> 18:05.951
why anybody would want
to kill your dad.

18:05.953 --> 18:07.369
My dad didn't do anything.

18:07.371 --> 18:09.455
I didn't say he did
do anything wrong.

18:09.457 --> 18:11.824
Did I?

18:11.826 --> 18:14.927
You understand that I'm
trying to help you here?

18:14.929 --> 18:16.946
Hmm?

18:16.948 --> 18:20.132
I can't do that
unless you help me, too.

18:27.274 --> 18:30.042
My dad was a dockworker,

18:30.044 --> 18:32.762
in Red Hook.

18:32.764 --> 18:35.498
And last week,

18:35.500 --> 18:37.500
when I was there...

18:39.370 --> 18:40.903
...his boss got really
pissed at him.

18:40.905 --> 18:42.154
Why?

18:43.857 --> 18:45.391
I said, "Why?"

18:45.393 --> 18:47.359
One of the containers
got damaged,

18:47.361 --> 18:50.195
so he opened it
to try to fix it.

18:53.717 --> 18:55.501
And he found drugs inside.

18:55.503 --> 18:57.536
What kind of drugs?

18:57.538 --> 18:59.004
He said it was cocaine.

19:00.675 --> 19:02.975
Why didn't you
tell me this sooner?

19:02.977 --> 19:05.711
My dad told me not to tell
anyone what we saw.

19:07.264 --> 19:09.214
He said it could get us killed.

19:13.905 --> 19:16.489
All right, Michael, need you
to stand right there.

19:19.943 --> 19:21.343
Take a good look
at each suspect.

19:21.345 --> 19:22.828
Take your time.

19:22.830 --> 19:24.730
Let me know if you
recognize anyone.

19:38.979 --> 19:40.162
Number three.

19:42.682 --> 19:43.749
Number three?

19:43.751 --> 19:45.352
Where do you recognize
number three from?

19:48.488 --> 19:50.239
That's the guy
who shot my father.

19:58.431 --> 19:59.532
How old is
your witness?

19:59.534 --> 20:02.100
My witness is old
enough to recognize

20:02.102 --> 20:03.619
the scumbag that
killed his father.

20:03.621 --> 20:05.621
See you in court.

20:06.958 --> 20:08.240
Your witness
is a kid.

20:08.242 --> 20:10.943
He's 13 years old, Jack.

20:10.945 --> 20:13.128
Nonetheless, I am going to
request a Wade hearing.

20:13.130 --> 20:15.114
You're challenging
that lineup?

20:15.116 --> 20:16.281
Based on what?

20:16.283 --> 20:17.466
Your only witness,

20:17.468 --> 20:18.500
the person you're
hanging this case on,

20:18.502 --> 20:19.468
is a minor,

20:19.470 --> 20:20.653
and an emotionally
charged one, at that.

20:20.655 --> 20:21.887
So what?

20:21.889 --> 20:23.589
That's not going to get
the I.D. thrown out.

20:23.591 --> 20:26.225
I think the judge
decides that.

20:26.227 --> 20:28.126
Why don't you think about
what you're really angry about?

20:28.128 --> 20:29.645
What is that
supposed to mean?

20:29.647 --> 20:31.680
First you were mad at me
for not being there for Nicky,

20:31.682 --> 20:35.234
and now that I am,
you're mad about that.

20:35.236 --> 20:37.353
Make up your mind.

20:51.952 --> 20:54.453
Glass of stout,
please.

20:55.872 --> 20:57.539
Do you want to know
how you know

20:57.541 --> 20:58.707
your second date's
not a date?

21:00.760 --> 21:01.710
How's that?

21:01.712 --> 21:03.762
When after
your first date,

21:03.764 --> 21:05.163
which was a date,

21:05.165 --> 21:07.349
he texts you and says
he's not gonna be able to make it,

21:07.351 --> 21:09.635
but you could
stop by his place

21:09.637 --> 21:10.886
after midnight.

21:12.722 --> 21:13.956
A booty call?

21:13.958 --> 21:16.392
Exactly.

21:17.727 --> 21:19.845
You can feel free
to move on.

21:19.847 --> 21:21.614
I'm not really in
much of a mood.

21:21.616 --> 21:24.733
If it's any consolation,
I think you look nice.

21:24.735 --> 21:27.403
By comparison?
I should hope so.

21:28.321 --> 21:29.905
There isn't a woman alive

21:29.907 --> 21:31.707
whose ass looks good
in that uniform.

21:33.326 --> 21:34.693
Well, I owe you
an apology.

21:34.695 --> 21:36.128
I left you
holding the bag.

21:36.130 --> 21:37.696
I handled it.

21:37.698 --> 21:39.248
And I made sure
the lieutenant knew

21:39.250 --> 21:40.883
that you didn't
have any part

21:40.885 --> 21:42.267
in me disobeying orders.

21:42.269 --> 21:44.753
Why did you
disobey orders?

21:44.755 --> 21:46.088
Because the Patrol Guide

21:46.090 --> 21:48.090
is called a guide
for a reason.

21:51.377 --> 21:54.096
I made the decision
that that kid's welfare,

21:54.098 --> 21:56.815
and how he views cops
for the rest of his life,

21:56.817 --> 21:59.018
was more important
than protocol.

22:00.320 --> 22:02.321
Besides, there was
a dozen other uniforms

22:02.323 --> 22:04.222
that could've made the
report, including you.

22:04.224 --> 22:07.159
You don't think your last name
had anything to do with that?

22:07.161 --> 22:08.444
Sometimes it helps,

22:08.446 --> 22:10.362
sometimes it puts
a target on your back.

22:10.364 --> 22:12.164
I can't believe
you're suspended.

22:12.166 --> 22:13.582
Seven days.

22:13.584 --> 22:15.784
Why don't you just ask your dad
to help you out?

22:15.786 --> 22:18.170
Because he's not that guy.

22:18.172 --> 22:19.371
You don't think
he'd support you?

22:19.373 --> 22:20.956
Support me, yes.

22:20.958 --> 22:23.509
Get me out of trouble
I got myself into?

22:23.511 --> 22:24.760
Not in this lifetime.

22:24.762 --> 22:26.345
Here you go.
Thanks.

22:26.347 --> 22:28.998
One more for my partner?
Sure thing.

22:35.305 --> 22:37.973
Detective, didn't you promise
Michael Hudson

22:37.975 --> 22:39.808
that you would find
his father's killer?

22:39.810 --> 22:41.894
Yes, I did, and that's
why Raul Delgado's

22:41.896 --> 22:42.845
sitting right next to you.

22:42.847 --> 22:43.862
Objection, Your Honor.

22:43.864 --> 22:45.097
Relevance?

22:45.099 --> 22:46.431
A 13 year-old is susceptible

22:46.433 --> 22:48.317
to suggestion, Your Honor,

22:48.319 --> 22:49.651
especially when we
have a detective

22:49.653 --> 22:50.736
making promises
that he can't keep.

22:50.738 --> 22:52.437
Their entire case hinges

22:52.439 --> 22:54.039
on identification
made by a minor.

22:54.041 --> 22:56.108
Your Honor, we have proven
the non-suggestive nature

22:56.110 --> 22:58.944
of this lineup, and age alone
cannot predetermine

22:58.946 --> 23:00.913
the validity
of this identification.

23:00.915 --> 23:02.548
Counselor?

23:02.550 --> 23:04.583
No further questions
for the detective.

23:11.725 --> 23:13.892
I'm sorry, Mr. Boyle,
but I must side

23:13.894 --> 23:15.344
with the prosecution on this.

23:15.346 --> 23:17.846
The child's age,
though a mitigating factor,

23:17.848 --> 23:19.581
is not enough
to discredit the I.D.

23:20.650 --> 23:22.601
At this time, I'd like
to inform the court

23:22.603 --> 23:24.570
that we will be
filing a request

23:24.572 --> 23:26.355
for a known DNA sample

23:26.357 --> 23:27.322
from Mr. Delgado.

23:27.324 --> 23:28.357
Noted.

23:28.359 --> 23:29.458
The defendant will continue

23:29.460 --> 23:31.360
to be remanded
without bail pending trial.

23:34.447 --> 23:35.664
Can't do this to me.

23:35.666 --> 23:37.416
I work for the Feds.
Right, I understand that,

23:37.418 --> 23:39.668
but this is no longer
their jurisdiction, I'm sorry.

23:39.670 --> 23:41.754
No, I'm protected, man.

23:41.756 --> 23:43.488
Mr. Delgado...

23:43.490 --> 23:44.990
They said nothing would happen.

23:44.992 --> 23:46.208
You and I can meet later

23:46.210 --> 23:48.460
to discuss strategy,
but for now,

23:48.462 --> 23:50.328
you have to comply.

24:04.028 --> 24:06.145
Don't move!

24:09.232 --> 24:10.415
Don't anybody move!

24:21.516 --> 24:22.983
Walk.

24:22.985 --> 24:23.951
Let's go!

24:23.953 --> 24:25.686
Get back and get in that corner.

24:25.688 --> 24:27.021
You think I'm playing
with you, huh?

24:27.023 --> 24:28.221
Get back!

24:30.158 --> 24:31.892
Very slowly,
come down off of there.

24:33.394 --> 24:34.912
You! Move.

24:34.914 --> 24:36.397
Move.
Calm down, please.

24:36.399 --> 24:39.233
Yo, shut up!

24:39.235 --> 24:40.167
Stop what you're doing.

24:40.169 --> 24:41.735
Use your head, Raul.

24:41.737 --> 24:43.737
I got this punk kid I.D.'ing me.

24:43.739 --> 24:46.173
Now I got to give DNA?

24:46.175 --> 24:47.758
It's not looking
too good for me.

24:47.760 --> 24:50.260
Right?

24:50.262 --> 24:52.079
Yo, what are you doing?!

24:53.415 --> 24:55.182
Move!
Please!

24:55.184 --> 24:56.934
Relax, please!
Move!

24:56.936 --> 24:59.086
Please, relax!
Yo, shut up!

25:00.723 --> 25:02.589
No! No...
Jack?

25:02.591 --> 25:04.925
Jack?
God!

25:09.781 --> 25:12.366
<i>I believe the current number</i>
<i>is a little over</i>

25:12.368 --> 25:14.601
<i>2,000 security cameras</i>
<i>in New York City.</i>

25:14.603 --> 25:16.203
<i>Big Brother is indeed watching.</i>

25:16.205 --> 25:19.156
Plus officers going
undercover in mosques.

25:19.158 --> 25:21.425
Plus innocent citizens
getting stopped and frisked

25:21.427 --> 25:24.628
on the street every day, almost
100% of them black or Latino.

25:24.630 --> 25:27.247
Which, as the Reverend Potter
well knows,

25:27.249 --> 25:29.500
is the same
racial representation

25:29.502 --> 25:31.635
of assailants and victims.

25:31.637 --> 25:33.837
But, Commissioner,
isn't that kind of pigeonholing

25:33.839 --> 25:35.222
part of the problem,

25:35.224 --> 25:37.057
but not the solution?

25:37.059 --> 25:38.976
It's not either.
It's just a cold fact.

25:38.978 --> 25:40.819
I'll tell you what I know.
And, Sean...

25:42.180 --> 25:45.632
...if the Reverend is correct,

25:45.634 --> 25:48.185
and the NYPD is
violating civil rights,

25:48.187 --> 25:50.237
why don't we see
evidence from some

25:50.239 --> 25:53.190
of the eight million
or so cell phone cameras

25:53.192 --> 25:55.642
that regularly record
police activity

25:55.644 --> 25:57.277
in this city?

25:57.279 --> 25:59.029
What I know

25:59.031 --> 26:01.498
is that our civil liberties
are being stripped away

26:01.500 --> 26:04.484
by the police under the guise
of keeping us safe.

26:04.486 --> 26:06.837
Do you know, Sean,
that there are

26:06.839 --> 26:10.490
license readers recording
every car entering and exiting

26:10.492 --> 26:13.177
the Lincoln Tunnel and
the Brooklyn Bridge?

26:13.179 --> 26:16.847
And now the Police Commissioner
is proposing video drones

26:16.849 --> 26:19.149
to fly over our heads,
to record everything

26:19.151 --> 26:22.085
that his pole cameras
have missed.

26:22.087 --> 26:24.788
When will it end?

26:24.790 --> 26:27.074
Commissioner?

26:29.844 --> 26:32.062
It'll end...

26:32.064 --> 26:34.148
when New Yorkers feel
they can go

26:34.150 --> 26:36.150
to the Thanksgiving Day Parade

26:36.152 --> 26:38.235
and New York City Marathon

26:38.237 --> 26:41.354
or Times Square
on New Year's Eve

26:41.356 --> 26:45.442
without fear that they are
a terrorist target.

26:45.444 --> 26:47.578
There's a report
of shots fired from inside.

26:47.580 --> 26:48.862
Do we know who fired?

26:48.864 --> 26:50.164
No, nor if anyone was hit.

26:50.166 --> 26:51.698
Your car's ready
to go down there.

26:51.700 --> 26:52.866
We're going to One PP.

26:52.868 --> 26:54.001
It's your daughter, Frank.

26:54.003 --> 26:55.886
The commissioner
does not belong there.

26:55.888 --> 26:57.421
He'll mess things up.

26:57.423 --> 26:58.672
It's not what I want to do.

26:58.674 --> 26:59.923
It's what I should do.

26:59.925 --> 27:01.942
One PP.

27:09.383 --> 27:11.818
I'm told he is the best
negotiator we've got.

27:11.820 --> 27:14.104
TARU is setting up a feed
from the site in your office.

27:14.106 --> 27:16.273
Where are we with the hostage team?
Sir?

27:16.275 --> 27:19.392
We're in an unusual situation.
What?

27:19.394 --> 27:21.945
Delgado said that he'd
only speak with your son.

27:21.947 --> 27:24.865
Seems he has a score
to settle with Danny.

27:31.840 --> 27:33.874
<i>We got a live feed</i>
<i>from the courtroom?</i>

27:33.876 --> 27:35.075
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

27:35.077 --> 27:36.543
<i>Good.</i>

27:36.545 --> 27:38.178
<i>Delgado's waiting</i>
<i>for your call.</i>

27:38.180 --> 27:39.746
You got him?

27:39.748 --> 27:41.298
You know the drill.

27:41.300 --> 27:43.350
Keep him on as
long as possible.

27:43.352 --> 27:45.252
Nothing that's
gonna rile him.

27:45.254 --> 27:46.303
Go.

27:48.357 --> 27:49.439
You just hang on.

27:49.441 --> 27:51.108
We're gonna get out of this.

27:51.110 --> 27:52.676
Just do me a favor.

27:52.678 --> 27:54.861
Don't be heroic, okay?

28:02.870 --> 28:04.037
Yeah.

28:04.039 --> 28:05.572
Raul, this is Detective Reagan.

28:05.574 --> 28:08.158
Who's in charge now, Detective?

28:08.160 --> 28:10.410
You are.

28:10.412 --> 28:12.796
We know you got a gun
and you let off a round.

28:12.798 --> 28:13.981
Is anybody hurt?

28:13.983 --> 28:15.916
I'm hurt, Reagan.

28:15.918 --> 28:17.467
That you think I'm stupid.

28:17.469 --> 28:19.419
That you think you're
gonna be able to talk me

28:19.421 --> 28:20.554
out of what I have to do.

28:20.556 --> 28:21.638
What do you want, Raul?

28:21.640 --> 28:24.508
200,000 wired
to my off-shore account.

28:24.510 --> 28:26.426
It's under my name
at World Dominican.

28:26.428 --> 28:30.297
Number seven, four, six,
nine, two, eight, two.

28:30.299 --> 28:33.133
And I want a flight
to the Dominican Republic.

28:33.135 --> 28:35.902
I can make that happen, but you
need to release the hostages.

28:35.904 --> 28:37.237
I don't think so.

28:37.239 --> 28:39.389
Raul, I need a show
of good faith.

28:39.391 --> 28:40.691
Give me a sign of good faith,

28:40.693 --> 28:42.276
and I'll get started
on what you want.

28:42.278 --> 28:43.443
One.

28:44.512 --> 28:46.196
I'll send out one.

28:46.198 --> 28:49.049
You send out one, I'll start
making the arrangements.

28:49.051 --> 28:50.384
But it's gonna take some time.

28:50.386 --> 28:52.252
That's one thing you don't have.

28:52.254 --> 28:54.254
You get it here by 3:00.

28:54.256 --> 28:55.756
Raul, that's two hours.

28:55.758 --> 28:57.040
It's not possible.

28:57.042 --> 28:58.709
3:00.

28:58.711 --> 29:00.510
Or I shoot hostages.

29:00.512 --> 29:02.863
Starting with your sister.

29:02.865 --> 29:04.348
Let me speak to her.

29:06.217 --> 29:08.885
Let me...

29:15.843 --> 29:17.844
Raul?

29:17.846 --> 29:21.198
You're facing more charges
now, you know that, right?

29:21.200 --> 29:24.601
And every minute
you keep this up

29:24.603 --> 29:26.353
makes it worse.

29:26.355 --> 29:30.240
Chances are you're not gonna
make it out of here alive.

29:30.242 --> 29:32.576
I will.

29:32.578 --> 29:34.527
If I bring her with me.

29:40.702 --> 29:41.668
Inside the courtroom.

29:41.670 --> 29:44.588
We got the pinhole
camera working.

29:48.142 --> 29:51.044
He's releasing
a female hostage.

29:52.546 --> 29:55.816
It looks like
the stenographer.

30:05.226 --> 30:07.577
Erin.

30:30.513 --> 30:32.180
Okay.

30:32.182 --> 30:34.899
The money's being transferred.
There's a car standing by.

30:34.901 --> 30:37.068
It'll take you to the airport
where there's a plane waiting

30:37.070 --> 30:38.570
to take you to the DR.

30:38.572 --> 30:40.689
I'm taking a hostage with me.

30:40.691 --> 30:42.657
To make sure
there isn't any mistakes.

30:42.659 --> 30:44.142
No attempt to stop me
at any point.

30:44.144 --> 30:45.143
Raul?

30:45.145 --> 30:46.644
You need to release

30:46.646 --> 30:47.696
the injured hostage.

30:47.698 --> 30:49.197
Your sister?

30:49.199 --> 30:50.832
She's the most valuable hostage

30:50.834 --> 30:52.117
I have, Reagan.

30:52.119 --> 30:55.203
She needs medical attention,
do you understand me?

30:55.205 --> 30:56.838
Please, you got to release her.

30:56.840 --> 31:00.008
I'll release her when I get
to the Dominican Republic.

31:01.344 --> 31:02.493
Let me speak to her, Raul.

31:02.495 --> 31:03.795
No.
Listen.

31:03.797 --> 31:05.263
If I do not speak to her

31:05.265 --> 31:06.465
and make sure that she's okay,

31:06.466 --> 31:07.599
then all bets are off!

31:07.601 --> 31:09.801
Do you understand me?

31:14.273 --> 31:15.724
Come here.

31:15.726 --> 31:17.275
Right now.

31:17.277 --> 31:18.443
Get up.

31:22.565 --> 31:24.449
Stay back, big guy.

31:30.156 --> 31:32.040
One false move...

31:32.042 --> 31:34.025
You try to tell him anything,

31:34.027 --> 31:36.161
I'll kill him.

31:43.586 --> 31:45.170
Erin?

31:45.172 --> 31:46.370
Are you hurt bad?

31:46.372 --> 31:47.722
Tell Dad I'm okay.

31:51.727 --> 31:54.929
If I walk out, I see a window
open, a sniper on the roof,

31:54.931 --> 31:58.099
anything off, I'm putting
a bullet in her head.

32:02.822 --> 32:04.239
Let's go.

32:04.241 --> 32:06.574
Ra-Raul, she's
wounded, all right?

32:06.576 --> 32:08.910
So she needs a doctor,
so you take me instead.

32:08.912 --> 32:10.195
You move out of the way.

32:10.197 --> 32:11.613
Jack?
No, I'm gonna go with you.

32:11.615 --> 32:12.730
Yo, am I speaking English?

32:12.732 --> 32:14.416
Jack!

32:16.285 --> 32:17.786
Let's go now!

32:17.788 --> 32:19.454
Okay...

32:19.456 --> 32:20.972
Ow!

32:37.307 --> 32:39.941
You sure you want
to keep watching this?

32:39.943 --> 32:42.110
I don't have a choice.

32:50.903 --> 32:52.270
I got no weapons.

32:58.627 --> 33:00.995
Prove it.

33:00.997 --> 33:03.331
Okay.

33:03.333 --> 33:06.617
I'm gonna step out to the front
of the vehicle, all right?

33:06.619 --> 33:07.952
Take it easy.

33:07.954 --> 33:10.004
Taking my jacket off.

33:10.006 --> 33:11.956
Nothing in my holster.

33:11.958 --> 33:13.825
All right?

33:13.827 --> 33:15.626
Open your shirt.

33:15.628 --> 33:17.479
Open your shirt!

33:17.481 --> 33:20.965
Come on, I got
nothing, all right?

33:22.601 --> 33:24.569
The money's transferred, Raul.

33:24.571 --> 33:26.738
Yeah, I know;
I confirmed.

33:26.740 --> 33:28.439
Okay.

33:28.441 --> 33:29.691
Get in the car
with me, all right?

33:29.693 --> 33:31.326
Drive you to the airport.

33:31.328 --> 33:33.995
Jet's fueled up and
ready to go at Kennedy.

33:33.997 --> 33:36.247
Just release her first,
all right?

33:36.249 --> 33:37.732
No way, man.

33:37.734 --> 33:39.200
I can't release her.

33:39.202 --> 33:40.752
She's my insurance
I won't be killed.

33:40.754 --> 33:43.288
That you won't pull anything.

33:44.256 --> 33:46.040
I'm giving you my word.

33:46.042 --> 33:47.575
Your word is crap, man.

33:47.577 --> 33:49.294
I'll release her

33:49.296 --> 33:51.679
when I get to the
Dominican Republic.

33:58.020 --> 34:01.439
I'm promising you safe passage
to the DR, okay?

34:01.441 --> 34:03.725
Okay?

34:03.727 --> 34:05.393
But you can't take her with you.

34:05.395 --> 34:06.728
Just leave her here.

34:06.730 --> 34:08.112
Come on, you and me.

34:08.114 --> 34:09.280
No way, man.

34:09.282 --> 34:10.848
Raul, come on.

34:10.850 --> 34:12.400
I've given you everything
you asked for.

34:12.402 --> 34:14.569
Everything you asked for,
I got it for you.

34:14.571 --> 34:18.289
I'm only asking you
one thing in return.

34:18.291 --> 34:20.241
Please, please, one thing.

34:20.243 --> 34:21.576
One thing, come on.

34:21.578 --> 34:22.693
Look at me, hey, hey.

34:22.695 --> 34:24.178
Look at me.

34:25.664 --> 34:27.549
Hey.

34:33.705 --> 34:37.141
Please don't hurt my family.

34:38.010 --> 34:40.395
Please don't hurt my family.

34:46.937 --> 34:48.386
Grab the piece.

34:52.608 --> 34:54.576
Are you okay?

34:54.578 --> 34:56.777
Yeah.

35:22.888 --> 35:24.772
How's the wing?

35:24.774 --> 35:27.058
Same as it was
the last time you asked,

35:27.060 --> 35:28.610
ten minutes ago.

35:28.612 --> 35:30.778
Aunt Erin, do you need help
with anything?

35:30.780 --> 35:31.813
No, that's okay.

35:31.815 --> 35:32.780
Thanks, Jack.

35:32.782 --> 35:35.266
We got Erin
dodging bullets,

35:35.268 --> 35:37.485
and Jamie telling
off his bosses.

35:37.487 --> 35:39.937
It's been a banner week
for the family business.

35:39.939 --> 35:41.939
I didn't tell anyone off.

35:41.941 --> 35:44.292
Oh, and here you thought
I was the troublemaker, Dad.

35:44.994 --> 35:46.327
Who'd you tell off?
No one.

35:46.329 --> 35:48.129
God, there is no privacy
in this family.

35:48.131 --> 35:50.081
Personally, I say you're
not doing your job

35:50.083 --> 35:51.916
if you're not getting
complaints or being suspended.

35:51.918 --> 35:55.219
So you got to break the rules
in order to be a good cop?

35:55.221 --> 35:57.088
No, I'm just saying,
if you're an active cop

35:57.090 --> 35:58.890
and you're passionate
about what you do,

35:58.892 --> 36:00.958
you're bound
to piss somebody off.

36:00.960 --> 36:02.644
And nobody knows that
better than you.

36:02.646 --> 36:05.897
Well, the apples don't
fall far from the tree.

36:05.899 --> 36:08.700
Hmm? Really? You?

36:08.702 --> 36:11.302
Two weeks without pay

36:11.304 --> 36:12.987
for telling a chief to stick it

36:12.989 --> 36:14.739
where the sun don't shine.

36:16.159 --> 36:19.243
Two days suspension for kicking
a rapist in the nuts.

36:19.245 --> 36:20.528
Been suspended 20 days

36:20.530 --> 36:23.114
for calling out a corrupt
judge in open court.

36:23.116 --> 36:26.334
So does that mean if I get
suspended from school...

36:26.336 --> 36:27.919
No.

36:27.921 --> 36:29.570
Nah, that's not
what we're saying, sweetie.

36:29.572 --> 36:30.788
We're not saying
that getting suspended

36:30.790 --> 36:31.839
is a badge of honor.

36:31.841 --> 36:34.275
But sometimes you have
to follow your heart

36:34.277 --> 36:36.744
even if you do break the rules.

36:37.846 --> 36:39.097
I think we should make
a new rule

36:39.099 --> 36:40.348
that we don't keep secrets

36:40.350 --> 36:41.716
about family members being
in danger

36:41.718 --> 36:43.317
and make them wait
until the next morning

36:43.319 --> 36:44.835
to hear about it.
Hmm.

36:44.837 --> 36:47.105
We didn't want you
to worry, Nicky.

36:48.023 --> 36:49.774
But I am grateful to you,
Uncle Danny,

36:49.776 --> 36:51.676
for saving my mom.

36:54.279 --> 36:56.180
Actually, we have
your grandfather to thank, too.

36:56.182 --> 36:57.482
I mean, Uncle Danny

36:57.484 --> 36:58.566
for being there,

36:58.568 --> 36:59.567
but your grandfather

36:59.569 --> 37:01.569
for preparing us
when we were little.

37:01.571 --> 37:02.704
That's right.

37:02.706 --> 37:04.822
If I say, "Please
don't hurt my family,"

37:04.824 --> 37:06.391
- what are you guys gonna do?
- Hit the ground.

37:06.393 --> 37:07.575
Because?

37:07.577 --> 37:09.410
Because that means
Dad's gonna shoot the bad guy.

37:09.412 --> 37:10.411
There you go.

37:10.413 --> 37:12.580
Is that how you saved Aunt Erin?
Mm-hmm.

37:12.582 --> 37:14.165
Really?
Wow.

37:14.167 --> 37:15.249
Who invented that?

37:15.251 --> 37:16.918
Your grandfather.

37:16.920 --> 37:17.902
I mean, you used to

37:17.904 --> 37:19.087
drill that into us

37:19.089 --> 37:20.505
every time we went
into the city.

37:20.507 --> 37:21.889
Or every time we got
on the subway.

37:21.891 --> 37:23.257
Actually, Pop invented it.

37:23.259 --> 37:24.809
He used to do
the same thing to me.

37:24.811 --> 37:26.878
But we actually never had
to use it.

37:27.879 --> 37:30.064
And please God,
we never will again.

37:41.276 --> 37:42.944
Hey.

37:42.946 --> 37:45.363
Hey, what are you doing here?

37:45.365 --> 37:46.864
Well, I was gonna
come see you

37:46.866 --> 37:49.834
at the hospital, but I knew
you had your family there,

37:49.836 --> 37:51.402
and they always carry
loaded weapons.

37:51.404 --> 37:52.637
So, uh...

37:52.639 --> 37:54.071
Here.

37:54.073 --> 37:55.173
Well, I do love roses.

37:55.175 --> 37:57.258
Thank you.
Yeah, I know.

37:57.260 --> 37:58.843
How's the shoulder?

37:58.845 --> 37:59.961
Oh, I guess I was lucky.

37:59.963 --> 38:01.295
It's just a little
muscle damage.

38:01.297 --> 38:02.346
How's the head?

38:02.348 --> 38:03.747
Thick as ever.

38:04.550 --> 38:05.800
Anyway, I just wanted
to make sure

38:05.802 --> 38:06.851
that you're all right.

38:06.853 --> 38:08.752
I am. I'm all right.

38:10.939 --> 38:13.090
Okay.

38:16.862 --> 38:20.281
I, um...

38:21.316 --> 38:23.317
I could've...

38:23.319 --> 38:25.453
I could've lost you,

38:25.455 --> 38:28.372
but you know what
it made me think?

38:28.374 --> 38:30.074
That...

38:30.076 --> 38:32.043
there is nothing
that I regret more

38:32.045 --> 38:33.961
than letting you go.

38:33.963 --> 38:37.715
And I have never
told you that,

38:37.717 --> 38:39.383
but there it is.

38:39.385 --> 38:42.136
Thank you for that.

38:43.622 --> 38:45.339
And I was really happy

38:45.341 --> 38:47.124
that you were there with me.

38:47.126 --> 38:48.843
Thank you.
Yeah.

38:48.845 --> 38:51.062
Thank you.

38:58.570 --> 39:01.355
What are we doing?

39:03.058 --> 39:05.193
That I don't know.

39:34.857 --> 39:36.824
It needed a new starter.

39:36.826 --> 39:38.476
I already ordered one
over the Internet

39:38.478 --> 39:40.161
to put it in, in the
next couple days.

39:40.163 --> 39:41.195
Thanks.

39:41.197 --> 39:42.864
No problem.

39:42.866 --> 39:44.232
We square?

39:44.234 --> 39:45.349
Well, it was 40 bucks,

39:45.351 --> 39:46.617
plus tax and shipping.
No.

39:48.204 --> 39:50.238
I'm talking
about the suspension.

39:50.240 --> 39:51.906
Are we square?

39:51.908 --> 39:54.191
We're square.

39:55.860 --> 39:58.963
If I had it to do over again,
I'd do the exact same thing.

40:00.582 --> 40:03.451
Balls is knowing the cost
and going ahead anyway.

40:05.203 --> 40:06.921
I'm going
to the new Tom Hanks movie.

40:06.923 --> 40:08.072
You want to come?

40:08.074 --> 40:09.373
I'd love to,

40:09.375 --> 40:13.311
but some of us have to go
to work in the morning.
