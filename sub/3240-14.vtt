These pieces
must be worth millions.

20:41.608 --> 20:43.174
More like billions.

20:43.176 --> 20:46.010
Everything you see in here
is an orphan.

20:46.012 --> 20:47.445
We're a swiss company.

20:47.447 --> 20:49.247
And since,
as i'm sure you know,

20:49.249 --> 20:51.515
Switzerland was neutral
during the war --

20:51.517 --> 20:53.017
The nazis used your bank

20:53.019 --> 20:55.753
To hide their looted art
after the war.

20:55.755 --> 20:57.221
Like otto heydrich.

20:57.223 --> 21:00.591
We've spent years trying
to find the owners with no luck,

21:00.593 --> 21:04.262
And we did our best to assist
karl with his collection.

21:04.264 --> 21:08.099
But sometimes it's impossible
to find a living next of kin.

21:08.101 --> 21:10.368
But why would karl
keep priceless art

21:10.370 --> 21:12.403
In his apartment
if he had you?

21:12.405 --> 21:15.406
Well, he only kept the pieces
that were ready to be returned.

21:15.408 --> 21:17.375
Do you know which pieces
he kept in his apartment?

21:17.377 --> 21:21.379
Karl was very wary about anyone
learning what paintings he had.

21:21.381 --> 21:23.247
He feared
someone would steal them

21:23.249 --> 21:26.150
And sell them
for their own profit.

you would have said so already.

You always had a gift
for seeing the truth in things.

Three years ago,

the entire family estate --

22:07.894 --> 22:09.694
Was mortgaged.

22:09.696 --> 22:13.664
I was forced...
To look for other means.

22:13.666 --> 22:15.433
But why?

22:16.502 --> 22:20.171
You always espoused
the evils of slavery.

What -- no bodies, so you're
doing an autopsy on a frame?

22:46.499 --> 22:49.333
Not an autopsy.
More of a diagnosis.

22:49.335 --> 22:50.735
Before a canvas
was painted,

22:50.737 --> 22:54.171
Old masters used
different extracts to treat it.

22:54.173 --> 22:57.508
Vermeer washed his canvases
with egg yolk.

22:57.510 --> 23:00.644
Van gogh used earth
and sand pigments.

23:00.646 --> 23:03.848
Now, see, if you can isolate
what extracts were used,

23:03.850 --> 23:06.250
You can tell
who painted it.

23:06.252 --> 23:09.186
Uh, this canvas
is dutch linen.

23:09.188 --> 23:12.523
Fiber content dates it
to around 1630,

23:12.525 --> 23:15.760
And judging
by the pigment contents,

23:15.762 --> 23:18.529
I'd say this frame
contained a rembrandt.

23:18.531 --> 23:20.831
All that
from a piece of fabric?

23:22.335 --> 23:24.235
You mustn't touch it

23:24.237 --> 23:26.504
Rembrandt used
extracts of lead

23:26.506 --> 23:28.606
And poison oak oil
to treat his canvases.

23:28.608 --> 23:32.510
Touch it with your bare hands,
and you'll get a nasty rash.

23:35.815 --> 23:39.150
When we were questioning julian,
he was rubbing his hands.

23:39.152 --> 23:40.951
I thought
it was a nervous tick.

23:40.953 --> 23:44.555
But he was scratching them raw
because of contact dermatitis.

23:44.557 --> 23:47.425
It's possible that he was
exposed to poison oak.

23:47.427 --> 23:49.460
Sam said he heard karl

for the painting,

Take your pick!

I'm sorry

do you want me to open?

from the docks.

that julian fought back.

of the killer's skin

31:20.045 --> 31:21.044

31:21.046 --> 31:22.746
I don't believe
that karl and julian

Were killed
by the same man.

31:24.350 --> 31:26.049
Why do you say that?

31:26.051 --> 31:29.753
The two bodies reflect emotions
of two very different killers.

31:29.755 --> 31:31.088
Julian was tortured,

Beaten over the course
of several hours.

31:33.525 --> 31:36.026
Whoever killed julian
was sadistic

31:36.028 --> 31:38.695
And had a seething hatred
for him.

31:38.697 --> 31:41.365
Now, karl, by comparison,
was killed swiftly,
