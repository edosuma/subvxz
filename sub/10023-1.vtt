01:47.207 --> 01:48.640
I win!

01:49.042 --> 01:52.205
You lost again. Hand over that rooster!

01:52.378 --> 01:56.371
No! No! I live for this rooster.

01:57.217 --> 01:59.981
I knew this old guy was a cheat.

02:00.153 --> 02:01.848
Can't we just give him a break?

02:02.021 --> 02:04.148
Let's cripple him
and toss him on the street!

02:09.562 --> 02:11.655
I'm dead!

02:12.365 --> 02:15.528
I'm looking for Fat Tang.

03:14.360 --> 03:15.725
Hm?

03:16.429 --> 03:17.794
Who is it?

03:19.165 --> 03:20.427
Ghost!

03:24.971 --> 03:26.461
Don't let him escape!

03:27.740 --> 03:29.298
MAN 2:
Catch him!

04:01.374 --> 04:02.898
Who are you?

04:03.343 --> 04:06.244
Duke Shou T'ing Hou.

04:09.415 --> 04:10.814
A pig!

04:15.321 --> 04:19.654
Out of the way! I'm the butcher!

04:39.879 --> 04:41.506
Is it dead?

04:45.018 --> 04:46.883
You killed my pig...

04:47.053 --> 04:48.714
...so pay for its meat!

04:50.323 --> 04:51.722
Pay up!

05:31.331 --> 05:32.355
DESIRE

05:33.833 --> 05:35.391
Five...

05:35.568 --> 05:37.331
...ten...

05:37.503 --> 05:38.527
...25...

05:38.705 --> 05:40.104
...30...

05:40.273 --> 05:42.070
...80...

05:42.241 --> 05:44.709
...100. This hundred will get me in.

05:45.845 --> 05:47.005
Just get in.

05:47.413 --> 05:49.108
One hundred?

05:49.282 --> 05:52.251
Where are you going, little 100?

05:55.588 --> 06:00.719
I got you, you little 100.

06:14.807 --> 06:17.537
With this 100...

06:17.710 --> 06:20.975
...Madam Mei and I'll be together at last.

06:21.647 --> 06:23.615
SIX MONTHS EARLlER

06:36.996 --> 06:38.486
Wind!

06:38.664 --> 06:41.258
Blow out my lantern if you dare!

06:46.072 --> 06:47.266
Huh?

09:08.180 --> 09:10.740
Who is that? Who's there?

09:12.885 --> 09:16.651
Chunge, you idiot! Get lost!

09:16.822 --> 09:19.723
You say get lost, I say go eat

09:19.892 --> 09:21.450
Let's go eat.

09:21.627 --> 09:23.561
To hell with that!

09:23.796 --> 09:25.593
Pick those up.

09:28.234 --> 09:30.828
-Hey, Chopper.
-Huh?

09:31.237 --> 09:33.262
-New clothes?
-Heh, heh, heh.

09:33.439 --> 09:34.997
Chopper's got new clothes

09:35.174 --> 09:37.039
Getting married today?

09:41.514 --> 09:44.745
Where does the lucky lady live?

09:45.851 --> 09:48.820
-The House of a Thousand Flowers.
-A thousand flowers--

09:48.988 --> 09:52.185
The House of a Thousand Flowers?
Chopper, you can't go there.

09:52.358 --> 09:55.452
-Why not?
-That place ain't for people like us.

09:55.628 --> 09:56.890
Let me pass. Move!

09:57.063 --> 09:58.121
-No way!
-Move!

09:58.297 --> 09:59.730
-Don't go!
-Move!

09:59.899 --> 10:03.494
You can't go!
Unless it's over my dead body!

10:08.541 --> 10:11.374
You were rich when you arrived...

10:11.877 --> 10:15.074
...but now you leave a penniless wretch.

10:15.247 --> 10:18.011
The lady has a price,
but so does your health.

10:18.184 --> 10:20.175
An early death, an early reincarnation.

10:20.353 --> 10:23.186
If, in your next life,
you return as a woman...

10:23.356 --> 10:24.550
...come here to find me.

10:24.724 --> 10:27.784
And earn your money back
under my roof.

10:27.960 --> 10:34.297
Everyone was born with a purpose.
I'll have my chance.

10:46.245 --> 10:50.545
Hey, isn't that the butcher?

10:50.750 --> 10:52.718
I'm looking for Ma....

10:52.918 --> 10:55.978
Looking for your ma? She's at home.

10:56.422 --> 10:59.016
I'm looking for Madam Mei.

11:03.562 --> 11:05.757
-Who?
-I'm looking for Madam Mei.

11:06.966 --> 11:08.228
I'm looking for--

11:08.401 --> 11:09.459
I'm looking--

11:09.635 --> 11:11.034
I'm--

11:15.341 --> 11:19.402
I know Madam Mei will cost a fortune.

11:23.249 --> 11:28.414
But I have money, lots of money!

11:28.587 --> 11:33.024
Your hard-earned butchering scraps...

11:33.192 --> 11:35.683
...aren't even enough to greet her.

11:36.162 --> 11:38.892
Go find a woman who loves pork.

11:39.065 --> 11:40.965
You'll make a great couple.

11:41.667 --> 11:43.294
Get lost!

11:43.469 --> 11:47.371
You say get lost, I say go eat

11:47.540 --> 11:49.940
Is a butcher's money not real money?

11:50.109 --> 11:51.474
I want to see Madam Mei!

12:36.756 --> 12:40.522
Madam has been waiting for you, sir.

12:40.693 --> 12:44.129
Please go upstairs.

12:45.664 --> 12:49.498
The money is all mine.

13:20.833 --> 13:22.323
Madam Mei!

13:26.405 --> 13:28.270
Madam Mei!

13:28.440 --> 13:29.839
Don't move.

13:30.376 --> 13:31.400
Hold still.

13:33.145 --> 13:35.909
Is this the House of a Thousand Flowers?
Where is Madam Mei?

13:36.081 --> 13:37.639
You don't remember anything?

13:37.817 --> 13:40.012
There was a big bearded man.

13:41.487 --> 13:42.613
You....

14:05.244 --> 14:06.268
Got it?

14:06.445 --> 14:08.777
Big Beard!

14:08.948 --> 14:12.611
I'm gonna chop him into pieces!

14:12.785 --> 14:14.082
Chopper!

14:14.253 --> 14:15.345
I must kill Big Beard!

14:15.521 --> 14:16.681
No, you dare not.

14:16.856 --> 14:20.383
-What do you mean?
-Going over there is suicide.

14:20.559 --> 14:24.051
You only know how to butcher pigs.
You have no swordsmanship.

14:24.763 --> 14:26.788
What do you mean, swordsmanship?

14:26.966 --> 14:28.661
Like:

14:32.905 --> 14:34.133
Huh?

14:40.980 --> 14:43.278
To hell with swordsmanship!

15:32.865 --> 15:35.299
Chopper!

15:35.768 --> 15:38.362
Die in peace.

15:38.537 --> 15:41.472
I'll handle your funeral.

15:42.241 --> 15:45.108
Boss, he's not worth it.

15:45.911 --> 15:47.105
Please spare him.

15:50.516 --> 15:54.008
Chopper, just hold on a little longer.

15:54.186 --> 15:56.120
His swordsmanship is good.

15:56.288 --> 15:58.017
It'll be over in the blink of an eye.

15:58.190 --> 16:00.954
The wound on your neck
won't be bigger than a bowl.

16:01.126 --> 16:03.822
Let's have a meal in your next life.

16:12.838 --> 16:16.831
Boss, Madam Mei won't want to see this.

16:17.009 --> 16:21.742
Won't killing him
just dirty your precious sword?

16:22.214 --> 16:25.047
You. Strip.

16:26.552 --> 16:28.543
Not your clothes. His.

16:42.935 --> 16:45.563
I only kill people, not pigs.

17:06.224 --> 17:09.058
Have you eaten? Not yet?
Go home and eat

17:09.228 --> 17:10.252
Just go eat

17:10.762 --> 17:14.255
Have you eaten? Not yet?
Go home and eat

17:14.433 --> 17:15.694
Just go eat

17:15.867 --> 17:17.631
This is not your place

17:17.803 --> 17:19.794
Go wherever it suits you

17:20.305 --> 17:21.965
Don't lose face

17:22.141 --> 17:24.734
For the sake of your parents

17:24.910 --> 17:26.969
You see me, but you don't call out

17:27.146 --> 17:29.774
Can't you find your direction?

17:29.948 --> 17:31.609
Do you still remember me?

17:32.051 --> 17:34.110
Do you still remember
What your name is?

17:34.653 --> 17:36.416
I despise you and you're doomed

17:36.588 --> 17:38.749
Your life is over

17:38.924 --> 17:41.449
Just leave, never come back

17:41.627 --> 17:45.290
Never let me see your face again
Get lost

17:45.464 --> 17:47.625
Get out of my sight
You've got three seconds

17:47.800 --> 17:48.926
Just get out of my face

17:49.101 --> 17:51.501
Or I will punch you out

17:51.670 --> 17:54.537
And you'll never forget what I just said

18:16.028 --> 18:18.360
Madam Mei!

18:18.530 --> 18:23.126
You'll never see me again!

18:34.379 --> 18:36.370
Chopper!

18:38.150 --> 18:40.710
Don't!

18:46.725 --> 18:49.523
Why did you push me down?

18:52.064 --> 18:56.194
Chopper. I'm scared of heights.

19:07.045 --> 19:09.513
Chunge! Chunge!

19:10.716 --> 19:12.650
Chopper.

19:14.086 --> 19:17.249
Chopper. I'm here.

19:22.561 --> 19:25.394
My head is stuck!

19:43.382 --> 19:45.612
Wow, what a sharp cleaver!

19:45.784 --> 19:50.812
Be careful. Pull!

19:56.695 --> 20:00.290
Cleaver! Cleaver!

20:01.300 --> 20:03.598
What do you want this cleaver for?

20:03.802 --> 20:07.431
Kill-- To kill Big Beard.

20:07.606 --> 20:12.475
This cleaver is not for killing people.

20:12.644 --> 20:16.136
Give me that cleaver.

20:16.715 --> 20:18.979
You want it?

20:19.151 --> 20:22.712
First, let me tell you its story.

20:27.159 --> 20:28.353
VENGEANCE

20:31.730 --> 20:35.131
Scum! At least he's still alive.

20:35.667 --> 20:40.036
The venom has made him mute.

20:40.472 --> 20:41.905
Be grateful.

20:42.074 --> 20:44.474
Master has saved your life.

20:44.910 --> 20:49.870
Oh no, another useless burden.

20:50.048 --> 20:52.744
Master, this beggar may be young...

20:52.918 --> 20:54.317
...but he has suffered a lot.

20:54.486 --> 20:56.681
Now he's a mute. Please let him go.

20:56.855 --> 20:58.322
How about I let you go?

20:58.490 --> 20:59.582
Bring the accounts book.

21:00.525 --> 21:03.221
Burglary. He should pay for his crime.

21:03.395 --> 21:05.659
Twenty porcelain plates...

21:05.831 --> 21:08.766
...13 bowls, three wine vats,
eight clay pots...

21:08.934 --> 21:12.495
...one snake, two hens,
a rope of garlic, 580 pepper kernels.

21:12.671 --> 21:15.105
His sentence,
five months as a kitchen servant.

21:39.498 --> 21:42.831
Do you want to be a chef
or a street performer?

22:16.935 --> 22:18.425
Wait!

22:18.603 --> 22:20.298
It's still edible.

22:20.472 --> 22:23.805
Don't waste good food.

22:23.975 --> 22:25.772
Stop laughing.

22:25.944 --> 22:29.539
A bunch of useless idiots!

22:29.715 --> 22:31.945
Only worth scolding.

22:32.117 --> 22:34.278
I'm yelling because I want to help you.

22:34.453 --> 22:38.753
So that you don't ruin South Beauty.

22:40.992 --> 22:44.792
You're always making me worry
about you.

22:45.597 --> 22:47.189
And you, brat.

22:49.968 --> 22:53.199
What are you looking at? Get lost!

23:06.151 --> 23:08.483
Troublemaker!

23:15.827 --> 23:17.988
Don't worry. I've got your back.

23:37.215 --> 23:40.048
Mute. Close the door!

23:48.026 --> 23:51.120
Sir, we're closed.

23:51.296 --> 23:53.230
Let's go!

23:55.901 --> 23:58.199
Are they here to arrest somebody?

24:00.505 --> 24:03.838
Maybe you were seen two days ago
stealing from the blind fortune teller.

24:04.009 --> 24:06.034
No way!
A ghost must have reported you...

24:06.211 --> 24:08.839
...for sleeping with his widow.

24:10.048 --> 24:12.209
Honorable guests, welcome.

24:12.384 --> 24:15.615
We serve steamed bear's paws,
steamed deer's tails...

24:15.787 --> 24:18.051
...roasted duck, roasted spring chicken,
roasted--

24:18.223 --> 24:20.748
You don't like those dishes?

24:20.926 --> 24:24.054
Also red meatballs, white meatballs,
fried meatballs...

24:24.229 --> 24:25.890
...egg meatballs, three flavor meatballs,
four delights--

24:26.064 --> 24:27.190
Shut up!

24:32.437 --> 24:36.999
Which one of you is Big Eight Chef?

24:37.175 --> 24:39.166
I am.

24:46.618 --> 24:49.348
Royal butler,
His Excellency Eunuch Liu...

24:49.521 --> 24:52.752
...will arrive here on August 15th.

24:52.924 --> 24:56.690
He only eats the best food...

24:57.229 --> 24:59.663
...and he wishes
to try your famous Eight Courses.

25:00.098 --> 25:02.931
This is a great honor for you.

25:06.271 --> 25:09.707
Even think of running...

25:10.108 --> 25:15.910
...and you'll all be killed.

25:16.181 --> 25:21.084
The danger of being
such a famous restaurant is...

25:21.453 --> 25:24.217
...that you attract the likes
of the brutal Eunuch Liu.

25:24.456 --> 25:29.086
Many chefs have died by his hand...

25:29.928 --> 25:34.592
...for serving food not to his liking.

25:34.766 --> 25:39.533
I fear South Beauty is surely doomed.

25:39.704 --> 25:43.162
I must quickly find a successor...

25:43.341 --> 25:45.172
...so that if I am killed...

25:45.343 --> 25:50.371
...the secret of the Eight Courses
won't be lost.

25:59.357 --> 26:01.188
Brother Cheng,
have you seen my spatula?

26:01.359 --> 26:03.623
-What?
-I said, where's my spatula?

26:03.795 --> 26:06.821
I don't know,
but I do know that your wok is on fire.

26:08.633 --> 26:12.433
Oh, no! It's filled with oil!

26:26.184 --> 26:28.345
Who did this?

26:34.859 --> 26:37.521
Time's up!

26:37.696 --> 26:39.459
Bring your dishes!

26:45.737 --> 26:48.035
Apprentice Cheng.

26:48.206 --> 26:51.972
Dish name, "A Beauty's Sweetness."

26:59.050 --> 27:03.316
The pumpkin is completely tasteless.

27:09.327 --> 27:11.727
Apprentice Wu.

27:11.896 --> 27:14.694
Dish name, "Very Very Fragrant."

27:16.101 --> 27:18.296
The plate's not even clean.

27:18.470 --> 27:20.529
How can you hope to be a chef?

27:22.540 --> 27:24.030
Go, go, go!

27:24.209 --> 27:26.200
Apprentice Little Melon.

27:26.378 --> 27:28.812
Dish name,
"A Good Bowl of Shrimp Soup."

27:29.881 --> 27:33.044
Melon, what did you name your soup?

27:34.052 --> 27:36.714
It's "A Good Bowl of Shrimp Soup."

27:36.888 --> 27:39.322
What a stupid name.

27:39.491 --> 27:41.049
"A Good Bowl of Shrimp Soup"?

27:41.226 --> 27:43.660
He is such an idiot.

27:58.443 --> 28:01.879
Half a turnip, two tablespoons of tofu...

28:02.047 --> 28:03.639
...three taels of wolfberries...

28:03.815 --> 28:05.942
...ten apricots, some slices of oak...

28:06.117 --> 28:08.585
...and eggplant.

28:08.787 --> 28:10.277
Shrimp soup with no shrimp?

28:10.455 --> 28:12.446
No shrimp?

28:13.625 --> 28:15.559
Make it again.

28:28.139 --> 28:30.004
Master, have mercy.

28:30.175 --> 28:32.405
I admit that I didn't make this soup.

28:32.577 --> 28:34.977
Please don't kick me out.

28:35.146 --> 28:36.477
Who made it?

28:38.983 --> 28:41.110
No fainting. Don't pass out! Get up!

28:43.955 --> 28:45.445
Speak.

28:46.424 --> 28:49.086
What are you doing, Mute?
Are you crazy?

28:50.195 --> 28:53.323
Master, don't blame the mute,
it's my fault.

28:53.498 --> 28:56.797
When I was preparing my soup,
all my shrimp died.

28:56.968 --> 28:58.663
I had no way to prepare the soup...

28:58.837 --> 29:00.464
...so I asked the mute for help.

29:00.638 --> 29:02.503
How could the soup taste so terrible?

29:02.674 --> 29:07.771
Please give me another chance.

29:09.881 --> 29:11.644
What did he say?

29:11.816 --> 29:14.785
He said it's his fault
and he should bear the responsibility.

29:14.953 --> 29:18.480
No, it should be mine,
it has nothing to do with the mute.

29:18.656 --> 29:23.059
Little Melon begs your pardon, Master.

29:23.228 --> 29:24.661
Kneel down!

29:25.697 --> 29:29.633
You idiots are like the lost tadpoles
who are searching for their mother...

29:29.801 --> 29:31.325
...but end up following a turtle!

29:31.503 --> 29:35.030
Why are we wasting our time on this?

29:35.540 --> 29:38.441
Master, they should
both be thrown out on the street!

29:38.610 --> 29:42.307
Out on the streets begging for food.

29:42.480 --> 29:43.538
Nonsense.

30:04.235 --> 30:06.362
"A Good Bowl of Shrimp Soup."

30:06.538 --> 30:10.304
It's truly "A Good Bowl of Shrimp Soup"!

30:11.910 --> 30:13.741
It must be the elder brother's doing.

30:13.945 --> 30:15.276
Damn them!

30:15.446 --> 30:17.641
And now we're left fixing the outhouse.

30:17.816 --> 30:20.478
I must have revenge!

30:22.086 --> 30:23.348
Revenge!

30:34.933 --> 30:38.369
Twist a knife in their hearts?
I'll sharpen the blade.

30:42.740 --> 30:44.230
KNIFE

30:45.677 --> 30:46.769
HEART

30:48.413 --> 30:49.437
GRIN AND BEAR IT

30:49.614 --> 30:52.412
Maybe you can bear it, but I can't!

30:53.084 --> 30:54.949
Hiding my spatula!

30:55.119 --> 30:57.280
Murdering my shrimp!

30:57.455 --> 30:58.888
Stealing my money!

30:59.057 --> 31:01.423
Putting chili in my underwear!

31:01.593 --> 31:03.083
You set me up!

31:03.261 --> 31:05.627
I'll strike you dead!

31:27.385 --> 31:29.444
The soup was delicious...

31:29.621 --> 31:32.215
...yet we're still sent to the outhouse.

31:32.390 --> 31:35.826
When are we going to get our chance?

31:36.861 --> 31:40.957
When will I learn the Eight Courses?

31:44.969 --> 31:49.497
Don't you know,
Master's Eight Courses are amazing.

31:49.674 --> 31:51.972
Nobody has ever figured out
how Master does it.

31:52.176 --> 31:55.634
Especially the eighth course,
"The Eight lmmortals Cross the Sea."

31:55.813 --> 31:59.374
Even those who've spied on him...

32:01.152 --> 32:03.780
...don't know how it's done.

32:21.105 --> 32:23.437
Off to the outhouse again? Diarrhea?

32:26.678 --> 32:28.543
What is it?

32:28.713 --> 32:29.737
Get off me!

32:29.914 --> 32:31.176
What's wrong?

32:33.017 --> 32:34.279
Fire!

32:34.452 --> 32:36.477
Fire! Get up!

32:38.723 --> 32:39.985
Master!

32:40.158 --> 32:41.386
What shall we do?

32:41.559 --> 32:42.821
Master is still inside!

32:42.994 --> 32:45.622
Master is burning inside!

32:45.797 --> 32:47.128
Master!

32:47.298 --> 32:49.858
What?

32:52.904 --> 32:54.462
Understood? Quick!

32:55.206 --> 32:56.798
Mute, put this on!

32:56.975 --> 32:58.408
Hurry up!

32:58.576 --> 33:00.373
Mute, go save the Master!

33:10.922 --> 33:13.322
You bunch of good-for-nothing idiots!

33:13.491 --> 33:18.053
Standing there slack-jawed...

33:18.229 --> 33:21.562
...not even trying to rescue anyone.

33:23.267 --> 33:25.497
Utterly useless!

33:27.739 --> 33:30.435
I officially take the Mute as my pupil...

33:30.608 --> 33:33.099
...to learn my culinary arts.

33:38.449 --> 33:40.110
Kneel.

33:57.201 --> 33:58.998
Chop.

34:21.225 --> 34:24.489
Be pragmatic...

34:24.661 --> 34:26.322
...as a cook and as a man.

34:30.333 --> 34:31.995
- Master is taking out his knife.

34:32.170 --> 34:33.728
He's beginning to chop!

34:33.905 --> 34:37.068
He's chopping. Chop! Chop! Chop!

34:39.976 --> 34:41.069
He's finished chopping.

34:41.813 --> 34:44.782
- What's it like?
- Looks like he didn't chop a thing.

34:44.949 --> 34:47.042
Master must be too old.

34:47.217 --> 34:49.118
I guess he has nothing left to teach.

35:37.902 --> 35:40.735
Now you know the first 7 courses.

35:40.905 --> 35:42.497
Is everything clear?

35:46.310 --> 35:50.440
Now I shall pass on
the secret of the eighth course.

35:50.615 --> 35:53.516
"The Eight lmmortals Cross the Sea."

35:59.957 --> 36:03.723
This course
must be made in the blink of an eye.

36:03.928 --> 36:07.386
You must prepare the fish for cooking...

36:07.598 --> 36:09.065
...while it's still alive.

36:09.734 --> 36:11.065
Even when it's served up...

36:11.235 --> 36:12.998
...it doesn't yet realize it has died.

36:13.404 --> 36:16.100
It's still swimming in the soup.

36:16.307 --> 36:20.141
It tastes magnificent.

36:20.611 --> 36:22.806
Everyone thinks that the secret...

36:22.980 --> 36:26.507
...is my fast and precise slicing.

36:26.684 --> 36:29.619
Many have tried to learn my secret...

36:29.787 --> 36:33.587
...but, still, I'm the only who can do it.

36:33.758 --> 36:36.591
Do you know why?

37:00.318 --> 37:03.845
This amazing black iron cleaver...

37:04.021 --> 37:08.014
...is the real secret to this dish.

37:23.841 --> 37:28.642
ONE MONTH LATER

37:55.373 --> 37:58.865
I have passed all my skills on to you.

37:59.043 --> 38:02.535
Now I can die without regret.

38:46.924 --> 38:51.452
The poison is colorless and tasteless.

38:51.629 --> 38:54.063
It seems you are a master of toxins.

38:59.370 --> 39:01.565
Sorry for my disloyalty.

39:02.606 --> 39:04.836
You could tell it was poisoned...

39:05.009 --> 39:08.172
...so why did you still eat it?

39:09.980 --> 39:13.677
The dish tastes really good.

39:13.851 --> 39:16.183
You have learned well.

39:16.921 --> 39:20.288
Tell me, who are you?

39:20.458 --> 39:24.087
I've come here for revenge.

39:24.695 --> 39:28.893
I had no choice.

39:30.000 --> 39:34.903
My father was also a chef.

39:35.439 --> 39:40.433
Fifteen years ago,
he cooked for Eunuch Liu.

40:40.371 --> 40:41.998
Over the years...

40:42.907 --> 40:45.671
...I have planned many ways
to avenge him.

40:48.846 --> 40:54.478
But then I heard about
the secret of your cleaver.

40:54.885 --> 40:57.979
The evil eunuch is fond of fine cuisine.

40:58.155 --> 41:00.817
So I knew he would eventually come
to South Beauty.

41:23.914 --> 41:26.439
I never imagined...

41:26.617 --> 41:31.145
...that vengeance could make one
go crazy.

41:35.025 --> 41:37.459
But if you want to kill Eunuch Liu...

41:37.628 --> 41:39.823
...you won't be able to use poison.

41:39.997 --> 41:41.521
As I prepare Master's...

41:41.699 --> 41:43.599
..."The Eight lmmortals Cross the Sea"...

41:43.767 --> 41:48.864
...I will tempt the eunuch
to move in for a closer look.

41:49.039 --> 41:54.705
And then you'll be close enough
to use the cleaver?

41:59.216 --> 42:00.979
Yes.

42:01.952 --> 42:07.254
Only one of us
can have the chance to cook for him...

42:07.825 --> 42:11.591
...so I must die.

42:12.296 --> 42:14.594
For 15 years...

42:15.132 --> 42:18.067
...I've suffered so much humiliation...

42:18.469 --> 42:22.929
...waiting for this chance for revenge.

42:25.142 --> 42:29.238
Please forgive me, Master.

42:29.847 --> 42:34.807
My boy, you want to use this cleaver
for revenge...

42:34.985 --> 42:40.389
...but this cleaver is not for killing.

42:40.925 --> 42:43.655
Would you like to hear its story?

42:47.794 --> 42:48.818
GREED

42:51.364 --> 42:53.764
I'm dead!

42:55.068 --> 42:58.003
Who is Fat Tang?

43:08.448 --> 43:10.075
MAN 1 :
Murderer!

43:10.617 --> 43:12.676
Who is Fat Tang?

43:12.852 --> 43:16.754
I don't know! I really don't know!

43:22.629 --> 43:24.460
Sir, I am known to the world as--

43:39.312 --> 43:41.678
I am!

43:44.084 --> 43:48.111
I am Fat Tang!

43:54.494 --> 43:57.827
Oh, my lord, go easy on me, please.

43:57.998 --> 44:02.298
Fat Tang, the greatest swordsmith...

44:02.469 --> 44:07.372
... now lives in a poor village...

44:07.774 --> 44:11.801
...nailing horseshoes for a living.

44:11.978 --> 44:13.036
Huh.

44:13.213 --> 44:16.080
The greatest.

44:16.449 --> 44:19.748
What a hollow title.

44:19.919 --> 44:23.150
I've made enough swords in my life.

44:24.624 --> 44:28.151
All I desire now
is to pass my final days in peace...

44:28.328 --> 44:30.091
...with the odd cockfight to bet on...

44:30.497 --> 44:31.987
...some alcohol to drink...

44:32.165 --> 44:35.191
...and to hide from the world's problems.

44:35.635 --> 44:38.160
Well said.

44:41.374 --> 44:47.438
Would you still be unmoved
if you saw this?

44:47.847 --> 44:50.543
You, wandering swordsman.

44:50.717 --> 44:55.552
Where did you get this scrap iron?

44:55.722 --> 44:58.122
Scrap iron?

44:58.291 --> 44:59.815
Where else in the world...

44:59.993 --> 45:01.688
...can you find a piece of iron...

45:01.861 --> 45:04.694
...as great as this?

45:05.098 --> 45:08.465
What iron could be so great?

45:15.141 --> 45:16.267
It's that....

45:18.244 --> 45:20.371
It really is that iron.

45:21.181 --> 45:26.414
I never thought
that with one foot in the grave...

45:26.586 --> 45:30.750
...I'd see it again.

45:32.859 --> 45:34.053
Many long years ago...

45:34.227 --> 45:35.956
...the region was soaked in blood...

45:36.162 --> 45:38.357
...as swordsmen fought each other...

45:38.531 --> 45:42.092
...for the title of Greatest Swordsman.

45:42.268 --> 45:47.672
Old Dugu sought to end the violence
and bring peace.

45:47.841 --> 45:50.833
He won the battles of Qilian,
Dongting, Zhongyuan...

45:51.010 --> 45:52.944
...and other countless duels...

45:53.113 --> 45:56.310
...defeating many legendary masters.

45:56.483 --> 46:00.886
After each duel...

46:01.054 --> 46:04.512
...he gathered their powerful weapons...

46:04.691 --> 46:08.422
...putting an end to the pointless battles.

46:09.229 --> 46:12.687
Old Dugu had Fat Tang...

46:12.866 --> 46:15.699
...melt all the weapons...

46:15.869 --> 46:20.772
...into a lump of powerful black iron.

46:20.940 --> 46:25.434
Then Old Dugu took the iron
and retreated into the shadows.

46:25.612 --> 46:28.137
When he died...

46:28.314 --> 46:31.715
...the black iron was buried with him...

46:31.885 --> 46:34.353
...in his secret tomb.

46:38.158 --> 46:42.254
This is Old Dugu's black iron.

46:42.428 --> 46:44.293
Where did you get it?

46:45.632 --> 46:49.466
Naturally, I dug it up from his grave.

46:51.237 --> 46:57.233
Is Old Dugu's grave...

46:57.911 --> 47:00.903
...as easily located as my shop?

47:02.382 --> 47:05.909
No one but his son could locate it.

47:07.253 --> 47:09.551
You? Are you--?

47:09.722 --> 47:14.489
I am Dugu's son, Dugu Cheng.

47:38.818 --> 47:44.279
Blasphemy.
You desecrated your own father's grave?

47:44.691 --> 47:46.386
Don't make me laugh.

47:46.559 --> 47:49.551
Isn't my father also your father?

48:08.881 --> 48:10.212
You....

48:11.317 --> 48:13.911
For this piece of black iron...

48:14.087 --> 48:17.579
...you dug up
your father's resting place?

48:17.757 --> 48:19.554
What you've done is too--

48:23.730 --> 48:26.255
You're too greedy.

48:27.367 --> 48:30.495
Fate will catch up with you eventually.

48:30.670 --> 48:32.729
You're right about me.

48:33.706 --> 48:35.264
I am greedy.

48:36.175 --> 48:40.635
But I have Old Dugu's blood
running through my veins.

48:40.813 --> 48:44.476
My fate is to be the Greatest Swordsman.

48:44.651 --> 48:46.380
Old Dugu!

48:46.552 --> 48:50.352
Why did you leave this iron behind?

48:51.024 --> 48:55.688
Why didn't you let me
pour the molten iron away?

48:58.364 --> 49:00.332
Master, you've got a point.

49:01.067 --> 49:04.559
You know how to melt this iron...

49:04.871 --> 49:08.807
...so surely you can forge it
into a sword.

49:08.975 --> 49:11.000
No!

49:11.177 --> 49:14.977
This black iron
is cursed with a murderous spirit.

49:15.581 --> 49:22.510
Your father wanted the killing to stop.

49:23.122 --> 49:27.582
That's why he hid it.

49:27.760 --> 49:32.254
And I swore...

49:32.432 --> 49:38.393
...to never forge weapons again.

49:39.572 --> 49:46.205
Swordsmith Fat Tang is already dead.

49:50.416 --> 49:54.477
We fight no more.

50:03.463 --> 50:05.795
Don't faint.

50:05.965 --> 50:09.731
I'll chop off one of your legs
and then see how you feel.

50:09.902 --> 50:13.804
Fine! Fine!

50:17.643 --> 50:20.077
My precious lron Head...

50:25.485 --> 50:28.943
...you didn't deserve to die like this.

50:30.356 --> 50:32.017
I will only ask once.

50:32.191 --> 50:37.527
Will you make me a sword or not?

50:42.902 --> 50:45.564
I will!

51:35.321 --> 51:37.949
Today, I become
the Greatest Swordsman.

51:38.524 --> 51:40.958
I'll spare your life as a witness.

52:02.548 --> 52:06.951
Dugu Cheng, for this piece of iron...

52:07.119 --> 52:09.053
...you've slaughtered so many.

52:09.222 --> 52:11.486
Even your own brother!

52:11.657 --> 52:16.321
You even dug up your father's grave!

52:17.263 --> 52:19.163
Your greed is beyond belief.

52:19.332 --> 52:20.629
You lack all morality.

52:20.800 --> 52:21.994
You say I'm greedy?

52:23.436 --> 52:24.994
So then what brought you here?

52:26.138 --> 52:27.867
To avenge my father!

52:28.040 --> 52:29.974
-To avenge my wife!
-To avenge my sister!

52:30.142 --> 52:31.632
To avenge my master's sister!

52:31.811 --> 52:34.177
To save this country...

52:34.347 --> 52:37.043
...from an evil swordsman!

52:37.216 --> 52:39.980
To uphold the peace!

52:41.254 --> 52:42.812
I want the black iron.

52:44.290 --> 52:46.053
You want the black iron.

52:46.225 --> 52:49.922
Let's see if it agrees.

52:50.096 --> 52:52.860
You've already forged it into a sword?

52:55.601 --> 52:59.162
The greatest sword.

54:44.543 --> 54:46.534
A great sword.

55:00.159 --> 55:05.563
I've got to move.

55:09.602 --> 55:11.570
Uncle Blacksmith...

55:11.737 --> 55:13.466
...I want to forge a sword.

55:13.639 --> 55:16.540
Silly child, why do you need a sword?

55:16.842 --> 55:18.002
Huh?

55:18.177 --> 55:21.510
If I had a sword, no one would bully me.

55:22.014 --> 55:24.346
I'll give you this rooster instead.

55:26.385 --> 55:28.250
Please, I'm begging you.

55:29.689 --> 55:31.213
Get up.

55:34.493 --> 55:37.724
What do you want to be
when you grow up?

55:37.897 --> 55:39.831
I want to be a swordsman...

55:39.999 --> 55:42.490
...someone respected.

55:43.803 --> 55:46.169
Silly child...

55:46.639 --> 55:51.235
...a swordsman's blade
only brings sorrow.

55:52.144 --> 55:54.044
Listen to me...

55:54.213 --> 55:59.583
...only a chef's blade can bring joy.

56:00.152 --> 56:02.643
I'll forge you a cleaver...

56:02.822 --> 56:06.280
...that brings happiness.

56:07.359 --> 56:09.054
Let's go!

56:09.228 --> 56:12.891
Let me see....

56:15.034 --> 56:19.801
Right! There it is.

56:24.977 --> 56:29.937
This will be perfect.

56:32.318 --> 56:34.843
Without a doubt...

56:35.654 --> 56:39.750
...it's the very best iron.

56:41.026 --> 56:43.085
It's great to be a chef.

56:43.262 --> 56:45.628
In the future,
you can open your own restaurant...

56:45.798 --> 56:48.494
...and people will come from all over...

56:48.667 --> 56:51.397
...to eat your delicious food.

56:51.570 --> 56:54.562
Isn't that better
than being a swordsman?

57:00.613 --> 57:06.415
Child, take this cleaver.
It will bring you happiness.

57:20.599 --> 57:22.829
MAN 1 :
Elder brother, why'd you have to die?

57:23.002 --> 57:25.493
He picked the right time to keel over!

57:26.939 --> 57:29.032
No, no!

57:35.347 --> 57:37.372
Oh, Master!

57:38.150 --> 57:40.744
If there's no one to cook tomorrow...

57:40.920 --> 57:43.855
...then there's no need for any of you.

57:44.023 --> 57:46.048
Kill them. Kill them all.

57:46.225 --> 57:47.658
Mercy!

57:47.827 --> 57:49.260
I have an 80-year-old wife...

57:49.428 --> 57:51.726
...and an unmarried mother!

57:51.897 --> 57:54.661
Please, I'm only a customer here.
I don't know any of them.

57:54.834 --> 57:57.735
There is someone!
There's someone who can cook.

58:31.136 --> 58:32.160
Your Excellency--

58:40.312 --> 58:41.540
No problem...

58:42.181 --> 58:45.878
...just be careful in your next life.

58:46.051 --> 58:47.348
Dear Lord, have mercy!

59:03.068 --> 59:04.365
Go!

59:17.483 --> 59:22.113
By the Royal Eunuch's order, start!

59:46.278 --> 59:48.246
Dish name?

59:48.881 --> 59:51.907
"Green Hills in a Single Color."

59:57.523 --> 59:59.491
South Beauty presents...

59:59.658 --> 01:00:01.285
..."Green Hills in a Single Color."

01:00:01.460 --> 01:00:03.360
Your Grace, please.

01:00:11.937 --> 01:00:12.995
Second course.

01:00:28.420 --> 01:00:30.217
"Yin and Yang Divided lnto Two."

01:00:33.559 --> 01:00:35.686
South Beauty's second course.

01:00:35.861 --> 01:00:37.795
Your Grace, please.

01:00:38.430 --> 01:00:40.159
Third course.

01:00:40.332 --> 01:00:42.960
"Three Ounces of Love."

01:00:45.070 --> 01:00:46.367
Fourth course.

01:00:47.206 --> 01:00:48.605
"Four Seas, One Home."

01:00:50.376 --> 01:00:51.707
Fifth course.

01:00:51.877 --> 01:00:54.175
-"Snowflakes in May."
- Sixth course.

01:00:54.346 --> 01:00:56.143
"Beauty of the Six Southern Dynasties."

01:00:56.315 --> 01:00:57.339
Seventh.

01:00:57.516 --> 01:00:58.813
"The Crescent Moon Among Seven Stars."

01:01:29.314 --> 01:01:31.043
Mama.

01:01:35.487 --> 01:01:39.787
His Excellency
is very pleased with these dishes.

01:01:39.958 --> 01:01:44.418
The chef may prepare the final course.

01:01:46.198 --> 01:01:48.826
Prepare the eighth course.

01:01:49.034 --> 01:01:52.595
Your Excellency, for the eighth course,
"The Eight lmmortals Cross the Sea"...

01:01:52.771 --> 01:01:56.764
-...I humbly suggest you watch very closely.
-Accepted!

01:01:56.975 --> 01:02:01.241
Please move
His Excellency's chair closer.

01:02:20.799 --> 01:02:22.130
Movement complete!

01:03:46.451 --> 01:03:49.147
Now start preparing the eighth course.

01:03:49.688 --> 01:03:53.886
Hey, hurry up.

01:04:02.768 --> 01:04:04.099
Want to die?

01:04:04.269 --> 01:04:08.899
No! The mute suggested that
to appreciate the eighth course...

01:04:09.074 --> 01:04:13.738
...His Excellency
should come even closer.

01:04:14.479 --> 01:04:16.447
Even closer?

01:04:16.615 --> 01:04:19.243
This chef has some plot.

01:04:19.418 --> 01:04:22.478
Take him outside and kill him!

01:04:22.654 --> 01:04:25.782
Have mercy!

01:04:25.958 --> 01:04:27.516
We only make the suggestion...

01:04:27.693 --> 01:04:29.593
...because of the dish's secret.

01:04:29.761 --> 01:04:32.127
LlU:
Wait, the dish's secret?

01:04:34.666 --> 01:04:36.497
Let's hear it.

01:04:36.668 --> 01:04:38.260
Your Excellency...

01:04:38.437 --> 01:04:40.462
...the secret of this course...

01:04:40.639 --> 01:04:43.733
...lies in the chef's carving skills.

01:04:43.909 --> 01:04:47.401
He must de-scale, gut...

01:04:47.579 --> 01:04:50.013
...and cook the fish
before it knows it's dead.

01:04:50.182 --> 01:04:52.946
The fish even keeps swimming
afterwards.

01:04:53.118 --> 01:04:55.416
Your Excellency, the mastery involved...

01:04:55.587 --> 01:04:59.785
...is not just in the taste of the soup.

01:05:04.162 --> 01:05:06.130
Interesting.

01:05:07.399 --> 01:05:08.730
Allow.

01:05:14.039 --> 01:05:17.270
Your Excellency,
as your humble servant, I--

01:05:17.676 --> 01:05:19.940
Move me.

01:06:01.787 --> 01:06:03.982
Take me to the bathroom.

01:06:04.623 --> 01:06:07.524
Your Excellency, congratulations.

01:06:07.693 --> 01:06:11.993
Excellent digestion, Your Excellency!

01:06:13.598 --> 01:06:16.590
This chef looks...

01:06:19.271 --> 01:06:22.832
...quite handsome.

01:06:36.822 --> 01:06:40.986
They always said there's more to you,
and they're right.

01:06:41.159 --> 01:06:44.595
No wonder the Big Eight Chef
wanted to adopt you.

01:06:44.763 --> 01:06:47.732
He always wanted his own son.

01:06:47.899 --> 01:06:49.958
I've always known you had potential...

01:06:50.135 --> 01:06:52.126
...with courage and a bright outlook.

01:06:52.304 --> 01:06:55.603
South Beauty will prosper.

01:06:55.774 --> 01:06:57.674
Let's immediately open another branch!

01:07:14.092 --> 01:07:15.616
Remove my outer clothing.

01:07:16.094 --> 01:07:19.530
The Royal Eunuch
has fallen into the cesspit!

01:07:20.866 --> 01:07:24.267
An army trains for 1,000 days
to fight one battle.

01:07:24.436 --> 01:07:26.700
Today is that day.

01:07:26.872 --> 01:07:28.965
We must rescue His Excellency!

01:07:29.141 --> 01:07:31.871
Your Excellency,
you have to float to the surface!

01:07:32.043 --> 01:07:33.943
Don't open your mouth!

01:07:34.112 --> 01:07:35.136
Don't eat anything!

01:07:35.313 --> 01:07:38.544
Your Excellency, grab my spear!

01:07:39.651 --> 01:07:41.710
ldiot! Why did you use the sharp end?

01:07:41.887 --> 01:07:44.822
When I get up there, you're all dead!

01:07:51.763 --> 01:07:55.164
The Royal Eunuch has passed away!

01:08:16.388 --> 01:08:18.219
My boy...

01:08:18.390 --> 01:08:21.917
...you want to use the cleaver
for revenge...

01:08:22.093 --> 01:08:27.395
...but it's not for killing.

01:08:30.234 --> 01:08:32.465
The Royal Eunuch
would've died anyways.

01:08:32.636 --> 01:08:37.438
I didn't kill him, but he still died.

01:08:37.609 --> 01:08:41.238
Master still died.

01:08:41.412 --> 01:08:46.783
If I didn't kill Master...

01:08:46.952 --> 01:08:48.977
...the Royal Eunuch
still would have died.

01:08:49.154 --> 01:08:52.953
If I didn't kill Master,
he still would have died.

01:08:53.124 --> 01:08:54.886
Chopper.

01:08:55.060 --> 01:08:57.721
Chopper.

01:08:57.895 --> 01:09:00.456
Why did you steal
that crazy man's cleaver?

01:09:02.367 --> 01:09:05.165
I want to kill Big Beard...

01:09:05.337 --> 01:09:07.600
...and save Madam Mei!

01:09:10.942 --> 01:09:15.207
Off to fight again. What about dinner?

01:09:25.490 --> 01:09:28.357
Where is Big Beard?

01:09:29.794 --> 01:09:32.091
Where is Big Beard?

01:09:32.264 --> 01:09:34.892
I'll carve pig head tattoos...

01:09:35.066 --> 01:09:36.897
...on every inch of his body!

01:09:42.173 --> 01:09:45.973
Boss, go home and butcher pigs.

01:09:46.176 --> 01:09:50.705
-Stop coming over here.
-Okay.

01:09:51.850 --> 01:09:56.583
Is acting like an idiot your hobby?
Look at that crappy kitchen cleaver.

01:09:59.691 --> 01:10:01.215
Crappy kitchen cleaver?

01:10:02.761 --> 01:10:05.059
I'll show you!

01:10:17.809 --> 01:10:19.071
You want to die?

01:11:27.879 --> 01:11:29.676
He's not dead!

01:11:37.555 --> 01:11:38.817
Run!

01:13:22.660 --> 01:13:24.252
If Madam Mei...

01:13:24.429 --> 01:13:26.488
...could stay with me every day...

01:13:31.035 --> 01:13:34.732
...and we chopped meat together,
wouldn't it be perfect?

01:13:34.906 --> 01:13:36.931
Yes.

01:14:14.712 --> 01:14:16.202
A toast to our hero.

01:14:16.381 --> 01:14:19.145
Madam Mei admires your bravery.

01:14:39.470 --> 01:14:41.563
Is that really you, Madam Mei?

01:14:42.307 --> 01:14:44.275
Before...

01:14:44.776 --> 01:14:47.404
... I only saw you in my dreams!

01:14:47.579 --> 01:14:53.313
Why don't you go dance
with your cleaver...

01:14:53.484 --> 01:14:57.750
...while Madam Mei plays her flute?

01:14:57.922 --> 01:14:59.014
No!

01:14:59.524 --> 01:15:02.891
-I'd rather write a poem for Madam Mei.
-Sounds great.

01:15:03.795 --> 01:15:09.734
But I don't know how to write.
Yes, a cleaver dance!

01:15:59.417 --> 01:16:03.217
How come Madam Mei isn't smiling?

01:16:03.388 --> 01:16:04.753
She never smiles.

01:16:04.923 --> 01:16:08.154
But deep inside,
she is filled with happiness.

01:16:08.326 --> 01:16:10.385
Rubbish!

01:16:11.562 --> 01:16:15.328
I know that expression.

01:16:15.500 --> 01:16:18.765
When my dad died...

01:16:18.937 --> 01:16:23.465
...my mom had that look. Not happy.

01:16:23.741 --> 01:16:26.209
Then when was she happy again?

01:16:26.377 --> 01:16:31.280
When my mom remarried,
she was happy.

01:16:32.050 --> 01:16:35.611
So I will make Madam Mei happy!

01:16:36.087 --> 01:16:38.282
I will marry her!

01:16:39.223 --> 01:16:45.162
Decorate the whole courtyard
with peach blossoms!

01:16:46.230 --> 01:16:48.596
Chopper.

01:16:48.766 --> 01:16:51.496
Big Beard.

01:16:52.370 --> 01:16:55.999
Chopper turned into Big Beard.

01:17:37.315 --> 01:17:39.681
I appreciate the care you've given me.

01:17:39.851 --> 01:17:44.288
I asked a troupe to perform a play
that expresses my true feelings.

01:17:44.455 --> 01:17:46.150
I hope you will like it.

01:17:48.893 --> 01:17:50.087
Okay.

01:18:07.512 --> 01:18:09.241
Stupid butcher!

01:18:09.414 --> 01:18:11.348
This is interesting.

01:18:11.516 --> 01:18:13.643
What's even more interesting...

01:18:13.818 --> 01:18:16.912
...is how similar it is to our situation.

01:18:17.488 --> 01:18:19.251
Right.

01:19:18.549 --> 01:19:20.312
My love...

01:19:20.485 --> 01:19:24.182
...do you still love me?

01:19:24.355 --> 01:19:26.585
I've never...

01:19:26.757 --> 01:19:30.386
...forgotten you.

01:19:51.315 --> 01:19:55.046
Please go upstairs, sir.

01:19:56.821 --> 01:19:59.381
He's coming. He's going to kill you.

01:19:59.557 --> 01:20:01.047
You've got to leave.

01:20:01.259 --> 01:20:04.456
No. Let's flee together!

01:20:04.629 --> 01:20:05.926
Go now!

01:20:06.097 --> 01:20:07.928
I want to take you far away from here.

01:20:08.099 --> 01:20:09.157
Leave, hurry!

01:20:09.333 --> 01:20:11.267
To faraway places.

01:20:28.986 --> 01:20:31.011
Oh, my beauty.

01:20:40.464 --> 01:20:42.091
Come here!

01:20:43.968 --> 01:20:45.560
Beast!

01:20:45.736 --> 01:20:47.795
I'll kill you!

01:21:30.514 --> 01:21:32.448
Stop! Stop!

01:21:33.251 --> 01:21:35.116
What is this crap?

01:21:35.286 --> 01:21:37.811
Why am I in it?

01:21:37.989 --> 01:21:39.456
Are you playing me?

01:21:40.758 --> 01:21:42.623
Yes, he's playing you.

01:21:43.628 --> 01:21:45.619
And him?

01:21:45.796 --> 01:21:47.093
He's playing Big Beard.

01:21:47.999 --> 01:21:49.261
And him?

01:21:49.433 --> 01:21:50.730
He's playing me.

01:21:52.003 --> 01:21:53.800
And him? Who is he?

01:21:55.106 --> 01:21:56.505
He....

01:21:58.376 --> 01:22:00.310
He's playing me.

01:22:00.478 --> 01:22:03.447
How? How can this be you?

01:22:03.614 --> 01:22:05.980
MADAM MEl: Everyone knows
that I love peach blossoms.

01:22:06.150 --> 01:22:08.345
But nobody knows why.

01:22:20.998 --> 01:22:25.594
We've been in love since childhood.

01:22:25.770 --> 01:22:28.500
The peach blossoms and the flute's song
formed our oath.

01:22:28.706 --> 01:22:29.798
FLUTlST:
Five years ago...

01:22:29.974 --> 01:22:32.534
...Mei was abducted...

01:22:33.077 --> 01:22:35.477
...and sold to this place.

01:22:36.914 --> 01:22:40.213
I traveled all over looking for her...

01:22:40.618 --> 01:22:42.779
...until one year ago...

01:22:43.921 --> 01:22:45.786
...when I finally found her.

01:22:45.956 --> 01:22:47.548
MADAM MEl:
We wanted to run away...

01:22:47.725 --> 01:22:49.659
...but we were prevented from doing so.

01:22:49.827 --> 01:22:52.796
We needed to get rid of Big Beard.

01:22:53.764 --> 01:22:55.698
Then you appeared again.

01:22:55.900 --> 01:22:57.561
Where is Big Beard?

01:23:02.707 --> 01:23:06.336
Get out of here! Go!

01:23:06.510 --> 01:23:08.671
I hope our paths cross again.

01:23:10.848 --> 01:23:12.042
Madam Mei.

01:23:14.151 --> 01:23:18.417
Can we have lunch together?

01:23:19.090 --> 01:23:22.150
Chopper, you are a good person.

01:23:22.993 --> 01:23:24.893
This is wonderful!

01:23:25.062 --> 01:23:26.859
The lovers finally reunited.

01:23:27.031 --> 01:23:30.489
It's a happy ending after all.

01:23:32.036 --> 01:23:33.731
It's so touching.

01:23:33.904 --> 01:23:36.065
I wish you a long, happy life together.

01:23:36.240 --> 01:23:37.537
Have a son soon.

01:23:37.708 --> 01:23:39.198
Have a safe journey...

01:23:39.377 --> 01:23:41.572
...and keep in touch.

01:23:41.846 --> 01:23:43.438
THE END

01:23:43.614 --> 01:23:46.344
We'll miss you.

01:23:47.318 --> 01:23:48.512
No!

01:23:48.686 --> 01:23:51.883
This is not the same as my dream!

01:23:54.125 --> 01:23:56.150
I don't want to be a good person!

01:23:56.327 --> 01:23:58.591
I want Madam Mei!

01:23:58.763 --> 01:24:00.890
You can't take Madam Mei from me!

01:24:03.868 --> 01:24:05.358
Do you see what's in my hand?

01:24:05.536 --> 01:24:07.128
Cleaver.

01:24:07.605 --> 01:24:09.266
How did you get a cleaver?

01:24:09.440 --> 01:24:10.566
It's yours.

01:24:10.741 --> 01:24:13.039
-What about the one in my hand?
-It's fake.

01:24:13.210 --> 01:24:16.304
Liar! How can you say mine is fake?

01:24:16.480 --> 01:24:18.505
Because I was the one who switched it.

01:24:33.631 --> 01:24:36.065
Give me back my cleaver!

01:24:58.022 --> 01:25:00.957
CHOPPER VS. THE FLUTlST

01:25:45.369 --> 01:25:46.529
This cleaver....

01:25:46.704 --> 01:25:49.571
Actually, I never switched the cleaver.

01:25:49.940 --> 01:25:52.238
You had the real cleaver all along.

01:26:01.819 --> 01:26:03.411
But you threw it away.

01:26:03.621 --> 01:26:05.213
REAL CLEAVER
FAKE CLEAVER

01:26:06.657 --> 01:26:07.919
You....

01:26:08.092 --> 01:26:10.060
You can't even tell true from fake.

01:26:10.327 --> 01:26:13.091
You don't deserve such a great cleaver!

01:26:13.264 --> 01:26:15.198
Give me back the cleaver!

01:26:26.377 --> 01:26:28.106
This is wonderful!

01:26:28.279 --> 01:26:30.543
The lovers finally reunited.

01:26:30.714 --> 01:26:33.945
It's a happy ending after all.

01:26:35.786 --> 01:26:38.186
I wish you a long, happy life together.

01:26:38.355 --> 01:26:39.617
Have a son soon.

01:26:39.790 --> 01:26:41.382
Have a safe journey...

01:26:41.559 --> 01:26:44.221
...and keep in touch!

01:26:44.828 --> 01:26:49.197
Madam Mei, keep in touch!

01:26:49.366 --> 01:26:53.894
