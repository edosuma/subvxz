01:47:15.632 --> 01:47:16.997
<i>Previously on "Sports Night"...</i>

01:47:17.067 --> 01:47:18.865
I have a younger brother
named Sam.

01:47:18.935 --> 01:47:20.926
Sam's a genius.

01:47:21.004 --> 01:47:22.301
I mean literally.

01:47:22.372 --> 01:47:25.740
He's energetic and articulate,
curious and funny,

01:47:25.809 --> 01:47:28.779
and there's no doubt that he'd be
living a great life right now,

01:47:28.845 --> 01:47:30.370
except for that he's dead.

01:47:30.447 --> 01:47:32.643
Abby Jacobs.
And this is my card.

01:47:32.716 --> 01:47:33.979
You should call me, Dan.

01:47:34.050 --> 01:47:35.040
She gave me this.

01:47:35.118 --> 01:47:36.483
-- Her card.
-- The digits.

01:47:36.553 --> 01:47:37.543
So she's a shrink.

01:47:37.621 --> 01:47:39.020
So why doesn't
your father like you?

01:47:39.089 --> 01:47:40.113
What?

01:47:53.436 --> 01:47:55.495
<i>I remember him being
pretty shy.</i>

01:47:55.572 --> 01:47:56.505
Your brother?

01:47:56.573 --> 01:47:57.665
Sam.

01:47:57.741 --> 01:47:59.539
I have an older brother, too,
named David.

01:47:59.609 --> 01:48:01.475
But Sam's the one
who was killed.

01:48:01.545 --> 01:48:02.706
Yeah.

01:48:02.779 --> 01:48:04.372
-- And what about the cafeteria?
-- What?

01:48:04.447 --> 01:48:06.279
You were talking
about the cafeteria

01:48:06.349 --> 01:48:08.943
and about how, after Sam,
you got nervous with people.

01:48:09.019 --> 01:48:10.180
Yeah.

01:48:11.588 --> 01:48:13.556
What were you saying
about the cafeteria?

01:48:13.623 --> 01:48:16.991
Just that I would walk up
to a table...in the cafeteria,

01:48:17.060 --> 01:48:19.358
and these would be
people I liked,

01:48:19.429 --> 01:48:23.161
and I'd be good for two or three
minutes before I'd have to leave.

01:48:23.233 --> 01:48:25.827
My friends called me
hit-and-run Danny.

01:48:25.902 --> 01:48:27.666
What would happen
after you left the table?

01:48:27.737 --> 01:48:29.330
-- After I left?
-- Yeah.

01:48:29.406 --> 01:48:30.339
Nothing.

01:48:30.407 --> 01:48:31.397
-- Nothing?
-- Yeah.

01:48:31.474 --> 01:48:32.407
You sure?

01:48:32.475 --> 01:48:34.409
Sometimes I'd go
to another table.

01:48:34.477 --> 01:48:36.605
I noticed you do that
on the telephone, too.

01:48:36.680 --> 01:48:39.149
I'm not that good on the phone.

01:48:39.215 --> 01:48:41.445
You're not that good on the phone, you're not
that good at the table. VVhere are you good?

01:48:41.518 --> 01:48:42.917
I'm good on television.

01:48:42.986 --> 01:48:44.385
I'll say.

01:48:44.454 --> 01:48:45.888
-- Did you watch the show tonight?
-- Yeah.

01:48:45.956 --> 01:48:47.822
-- Did you like it?
-- Yes.

01:48:47.891 --> 01:48:50.326
-- I've won awards, you know.
-- Yeah?

01:48:50.393 --> 01:48:52.487
Yeah -- VVell, no, I mean, but
I've been nominated for them.

01:48:52.562 --> 01:48:53.961
I'm sure you'll win one.

01:48:54.030 --> 01:48:55.156
-- So you liked it?
-- Yes.

01:48:55.231 --> 01:48:56.995
Yet you're not saying
that you liked it.

01:48:57.067 --> 01:48:58.000
I just did.

01:48:58.068 --> 01:48:59.126
Not really.

01:48:59.202 --> 01:49:00.931
In fact, I've said it
three times.

01:49:02.272 --> 01:49:03.535
You look great tonight.

01:49:03.607 --> 01:49:04.870
Thank you.

01:49:04.941 --> 01:49:08.002
-- You're beautiful and charming.
-- Thank you.

01:49:08.078 --> 01:49:11.048
-- Now, you see how I said that
without being solicited? -- Yes.

01:49:11.114 --> 01:49:12.582
Want another drink?

01:49:12.649 --> 01:49:14.913
How are you being
hit-and-run Danny right now?

01:49:14.985 --> 01:49:16.009
Jeremy, did I mention

01:49:16.086 --> 01:49:17.144
my "Close-Up" interview
tomorrow?

01:49:17.220 --> 01:49:18.346
Several times.

01:49:18.421 --> 01:49:22.051
Mr. Shane McArnold, Jeremy.
Mr. Shane McArnold.

01:49:22.125 --> 01:49:23.115
He's a twit.

01:49:23.193 --> 01:49:25.287
Hey, excuse me,
you weren't just talking

01:49:25.362 --> 01:49:27.057
about Mr. Shane McArnold,
were you?

01:49:27.130 --> 01:49:27.892
Yes.

01:49:27.964 --> 01:49:30.763
How about a lifetime
.303 batting average?

01:49:30.834 --> 01:49:32.097
How about 348 home runs?

01:49:32.168 --> 01:49:34.262
How 'bout back-to-back
30/30 seasons?

01:49:34.337 --> 01:49:35.668
How about the fact
that he's a twit?

01:49:35.739 --> 01:49:37.332
He happens to be
a friend of mine.

01:49:37.407 --> 01:49:38.932
He also happens to be
a...twit.

01:49:39.009 --> 01:49:40.909
-- I'm not talking to you right now.
-- You were looking at me.

01:49:40.977 --> 01:49:42.502
That's because
I was talking to you before,

01:49:42.579 --> 01:49:44.946
but now, right now, I'm shifting
my focus to Natalie.

01:49:45.015 --> 01:49:45.914
-- Okay.
-- Natalie...

01:49:45.982 --> 01:49:47.882
-- Did anybody see this? --
Tomorrow's “Close-Up“ interview?

01:49:47.951 --> 01:49:50.147
-- Did anybody see this... in the paper?
-- What? -- What?

01:49:50.220 --> 01:49:53.246
-- The Vatican says there's no
such place as Hell. -- Really?

01:49:53.323 --> 01:49:54.916
"Hell is not a place
but a state."

01:49:54.991 --> 01:49:56.481
-- There's no Hell?
-- No <i>Hell.</i>

01:49:56.559 --> 01:49:58.288
Well, that's a load off my mind.

01:49:58.361 --> 01:49:59.886
I shouldn't be here
with you people.

01:49:59.963 --> 01:50:00.987
So this is a date?

01:50:01.064 --> 01:50:02.361
This is a drink.

01:50:02.432 --> 01:50:03.627
I'll take it.

01:50:06.336 --> 01:50:09.237
-- What would happen when you left
the table? -- What do you mean?

01:50:09.305 --> 01:50:11.933
After two or three minutes, what would
happen after you left the table?

01:50:13.777 --> 01:50:15.677
Nothing.

01:50:15.745 --> 01:50:17.975
Wouldn't you shake sometimes?

01:50:19.949 --> 01:50:21.439
Sometimes.

01:50:21.518 --> 01:50:23.919
-- And you'd start to sweat? -- I
thought this wasn't a therapy session.

01:50:23.987 --> 01:50:26.319
And sometimes, Danny, wouldn't you
have to go someplace and throw up?

01:50:28.858 --> 01:50:30.519
Yeah.

01:50:30.593 --> 01:50:33.460
And there's no reason to talk
in the past tense, right?

01:50:33.530 --> 01:50:35.396
I mean, it still happens today.

01:50:38.735 --> 01:50:40.225
Yeah.

01:50:40.303 --> 01:50:42.328
And recently,
it's been worse, right?

01:50:44.174 --> 01:50:46.142
How do you know all this?

01:50:46.209 --> 01:50:48.610
Danny, you have to get hip
to the fact

01:50:48.678 --> 01:50:50.772
I didn't get my license
in the Virgin Islands.

01:50:53.583 --> 01:50:55.779
-- Thanks for the drinks.
-- You're leaving?

01:50:55.852 --> 01:50:57.616
I have an early day tomorrow.

01:50:57.687 --> 01:50:58.848
Can I take you home?

01:50:58.922 --> 01:51:01.584
I'll get a cab out front.
I'm just gonna grab my coat.

01:51:08.364 --> 01:51:10.731
<i>Casey: Remember,
this isn't live, it's on tape,</i>

01:51:10.800 --> 01:51:11.767
so if you have a coughing attack

01:51:11.835 --> 01:51:12.666
or you need to use
the restroom --

01:51:12.769 --> 01:51:13.600
It's good to see you, Casey.

01:51:13.636 --> 01:51:14.865
It's great to see you, Shane.

01:51:14.938 --> 01:51:15.871
You know, now that I'm in town,

01:51:15.939 --> 01:51:17.168
we should hook up.

01:51:17.240 --> 01:51:19.299
Yeah, absolutely. That's amazing.
That's what I was --

01:51:19.375 --> 01:51:21.605
Hey, Jeremy, Shane McArnold
just asked me out.

01:51:21.678 --> 01:51:22.770
He's a twit.

01:51:22.846 --> 01:51:24.780
Ah, he says
he's your number-one fan.

01:51:24.848 --> 01:51:26.179
-- Thanks.
-- You <i>bet.</i>

01:51:26.249 --> 01:51:27.444
Let's do it.

01:51:27.517 --> 01:51:28.507
-- <i>Here we</i> go.
<i>Dave: Roll tape.</i>

01:51:28.585 --> 01:51:29.711
-- Rolling.
-- Speeding.

01:51:29.786 --> 01:51:30.776
Sound speed.

01:51:30.854 --> 01:51:32.322
This is Shane McArnold
interview

01:51:32.388 --> 01:51:35.255
for "CSC Close-Up,"
11/17/99.

01:51:35.325 --> 01:51:38.260
Shane, after 11 years
with the Kansas City Royals,

01:51:38.328 --> 01:51:41.093
you opted for free agency and
signed with the New York Yankees.

01:51:41.164 --> 01:51:44.031
Let me be the first to say welcome to town.
How do you feel?

01:51:44.100 --> 01:51:45.499
Whoa, tough one from Casey.

01:51:45.568 --> 01:51:48.060
-- Why is everyone just accepting this?
-- Accepting what?

01:51:48.138 --> 01:51:49.469
There's no such place as Hell?

01:51:49.539 --> 01:51:51.564
-- <i>When did that</i> happen?
-- <i>Yesterday in the paper.</i>

01:51:51.641 --> 01:51:53.439
-- There's no such place as Hell?
-- No such place.

01:51:53.510 --> 01:51:54.568
Cool.

01:51:54.644 --> 01:51:56.442
Hell, they now say,
is a state of being

01:51:56.513 --> 01:51:59.448
and not the fiery pit of torment
depicted in books and paintings,

01:51:59.516 --> 01:52:01.712
to say nothing of the sisters
who used to beat me

01:52:01.785 --> 01:52:03.981
at our Lady of Perpetual Sorrow
Elementary School.

01:52:04.053 --> 01:52:05.214
They beat you?

01:52:05.288 --> 01:52:07.017
-- VVell, they yelled at me a lot.
-- Why?

01:52:07.090 --> 01:52:08.922
So I wouldn't go to Hell,
Jeremy!

01:52:08.992 --> 01:52:11.256
It doesn't sound like you were
taught by the world's happiest nuns.

01:52:11.327 --> 01:52:14.592
-- <i>This is</i> huge. -- <i>I guess the "Perpetual
Sorrow" should have been a giveaway.</i>

01:52:14.664 --> 01:52:17.099
-- You guys listening to this?
-- Listening <i>to</i> what?

01:52:17.167 --> 01:52:18.931
Um, the interview
you're producing.

01:52:19.002 --> 01:52:21.130
-- <i>Ha! Good one,</i> Dana. -- <i>You
didn't hear what he just said?</i>

01:52:21.204 --> 01:52:24.834
I'm producing this segment. My contract doesn't say
anything about my having to pay attention to it.

01:52:24.908 --> 01:52:26.876
He just said
he doesn't like New York.

01:52:26.943 --> 01:52:28.968
<i>Give me more volume.</i>

01:52:29.045 --> 01:52:30.604
I'm glad to be playing
for a contender --

01:52:30.680 --> 01:52:33.547
10 fingers, no rings,
you know what I'm saying?

01:52:33.616 --> 01:52:35.141
<i>This city is</i> a <i>pigsty</i> --

01:52:35.218 --> 01:52:37.619
<i>the garbage, the noise,
the traffic, the muggings</i> --

01:52:37.687 --> 01:52:39.985
Ask him if he's seen
"The Lion King" yet.

01:52:40.056 --> 01:52:41.922
<i>This is too much.
Casey, throw him a rope.</i>

01:52:41.991 --> 01:52:43.652
Don't throw him a rope, Casey.

01:52:43.726 --> 01:52:47.424
And you guys speak, like, what, 14
different languages or something?

01:52:47.497 --> 01:52:50.432
But still, you gotta be excited
about playing at the stadium, huh?

01:52:50.500 --> 01:52:52.229
[Exhales sharply]
He threw him a rope.

01:52:52.302 --> 01:52:54.134
Not really.

01:52:54.204 --> 01:52:55.933
He's wrapping it
around his neck.

01:52:56.005 --> 01:52:57.803
I am in such a good mood
right now.

01:52:57.874 --> 01:53:00.343
<i>Shane McArnold, newest member
of the New York Yankees.</i>

01:53:00.410 --> 01:53:02.174
Thanks for talking to us today.

01:53:02.245 --> 01:53:05.613
I'm Casey McCall
for "Close-Up" on CSC.

01:53:05.682 --> 01:53:06.808
And cut.

01:53:06.883 --> 01:53:08.715
[indistinct conversations]

01:53:08.785 --> 01:53:11.186
-- Hey, I thought that was pretty good.
-- Yeah.

01:53:11.254 --> 01:53:12.517
You didn't like it?

01:53:12.589 --> 01:53:15.183
-- VVell, no, I-l thought it was great.
-- But what?

01:53:15.258 --> 01:53:17.955
Well, I'm just not sure
that the, uh, first thing I'd do

01:53:18.027 --> 01:53:20.496
after coming to a new town
is to insult everyone.

01:53:20.563 --> 01:53:21.655
Who did I insult?

01:53:21.731 --> 01:53:23.358
Um...well, everyone.

01:53:23.433 --> 01:53:25.265
-- I didn't insult everyone.
-- You kind of did.

01:53:25.335 --> 01:53:27.064
-- You mean everyone in New York?
-- Yeah.

01:53:27.136 --> 01:53:29.434
-- Well... -- We got a bit
of a population here.

01:53:29.505 --> 01:53:32.372
Hey, I hear New Yorkers
say that stuff all the time.

01:53:32.442 --> 01:53:36.276
[Sighs] You ever heard the expression
“Nobody hits my little brother but me“?

01:53:36.346 --> 01:53:39.475
-- No. -- Okay, well, it's
-- it's an expression.

01:53:39.549 --> 01:53:42.746
-- What does it mean? -- It doesn't matter.
I'll fix it.

01:53:42.819 --> 01:53:44.514
-- Yeah?
-- I'll edit the tape.

01:53:44.587 --> 01:53:46.351
-- You'd do that for me?
-- No problem.

01:53:46.422 --> 01:53:48.083
You're the best, Casey.

01:53:48.157 --> 01:53:51.127
-- I don't know if I'd say that. I'd say
I'm among the best. -- Whatever, man.

01:53:51.194 --> 01:53:52.525
We're gonna hook up tonight?

01:53:52.595 --> 01:53:54.188
-- Yeah, I'll call you.
-- We'll hook up?

01:53:54.264 --> 01:53:56.062
Oh, yeah, yeah,
we are gonna throw down.

01:53:56.132 --> 01:53:58.123
-- You'll edit the tape?
-- Yeah, <i>I'll</i> just see <i>Dana.</i>

01:53:58.201 --> 01:53:59.066
-- Dude.
-- <i>Dude.</i>

01:53:59.135 --> 01:54:00.500
Later.

01:54:00.570 --> 01:54:02.561
-- [Snaps fingers] At you.
-- [Chuckles]

01:54:03.706 --> 01:54:05.174
[Sighs]

01:54:05.241 --> 01:54:06.902
I gotta go see Dana.

01:54:06.976 --> 01:54:10.139

-- <i>How you doin'?</i> -- <i>I'm giddy
as</i> a <i>schoolgirl, Casey.</i>

01:54:22.759 --> 01:54:23.988
I'm a cat with kittens.

01:54:24.060 --> 01:54:26.586
-- F' Now every time <i>I go</i> for f' --
Pretty happy with the interview?

01:54:26.663 --> 01:54:28.131

-- My dance of joy. -- Ah.

01:54:37.407 --> 01:54:38.533
[Laughs]
Let's watch it again.

01:54:38.608 --> 01:54:40.474
Say, I was thinking --
how would you feel

01:54:40.543 --> 01:54:43.205
-- f' I'm wafkfn' on sunshine f' -- about my editing
out the part where he doesn't like New York?

01:54:43.279 --> 01:54:45.805
<i>Fl Whoa fl

01:54:45.882 --> 01:54:48.214
<i>F Whoa F -- You've, uh,

01:54:50.954 --> 01:54:52.979

01:54:59.228 --> 01:55:01.720

01:55:02.832 --> 01:55:03.993
No.

01:55:04.067 --> 01:55:07.298
-- F' <i>I used to</i> think <i>maybe</i> you love me f'
-- Dana... -- You see what I'm doing now?

01:55:11.341 --> 01:55:12.502

01:55:21.918 --> 01:55:23.579
-- You ready?
-- Yeah. [Clears throat]

01:55:26.189 --> 01:55:30.922
This is teaser record
for VTR playback, 11/17/99.

01:55:30.994 --> 01:55:33.258
In 3...2...

01:55:33.329 --> 01:55:36.765
Tonight on “Sports Night,“ we'll check out
Herman Moore and the Lions' new-look offense

01:55:36.833 --> 01:55:39.461
and Rob Blake and the Kings'
old-school defense.

01:55:39.535 --> 01:55:41.469
We'll go back to the future
at Florida State

01:55:41.537 --> 01:55:44.029
and touch down in Monte Carlo,
as Yegevny Kafelnikov --

01:55:44.107 --> 01:55:45.632
-- Cut.
-- What?

01:55:45.708 --> 01:55:47.403
-- You said, "Yegevny."
-- <i>I did?</i>

01:55:47.477 --> 01:55:49.309
-- It's Yevgeny.
-- I know.

01:55:49.379 --> 01:55:51.245
-- <i>You said "Yegevny."</i>
-- <i>Let's do it again.</i>

01:55:51.314 --> 01:55:53.214
-- <i>You inverted two syllables.</i>
-- <i>Roll tape.</i>

01:55:53.282 --> 01:55:56.479
In 3...2...

01:55:56.552 --> 01:56:00.614
Tonight on “Sports Night,“ we'll check out
Herman Moore and the Lions' new-look offense

01:56:00.690 --> 01:56:03.284
and Rob Blake and the Kings'
old-school defense.

01:56:03.359 --> 01:56:05.555
We'll go back to the future
at Florida State

01:56:05.628 --> 01:56:08.290
and touch down in Monte Carlo
as Yegevny Kafelnikov --

01:56:08.364 --> 01:56:09.627
-- I did it again.
-- <i>Yes.</i>

01:56:09.699 --> 01:56:11.963
I said "Yegevny"
instead of Yevgeny.

01:56:12.035 --> 01:56:14.094
-- We could change the tease.
-- What <i>do</i> you mean?

01:56:14.170 --> 01:56:15.968
-- Make it about Pete Sampras.
-- <i>I</i> can <i>do this.</i>

01:56:16.039 --> 01:56:18.201
-- Rafter's an easy name to pronounce.
-- Rolf tape.

01:56:18.274 --> 01:56:19.241
Danny...

01:56:19.308 --> 01:56:20.798
-- I'm just in the middle --
-- One second.

01:56:25.348 --> 01:56:27.180
I'm in a spot of trouble.

01:56:27.250 --> 01:56:28.376
Me too.

01:56:28.451 --> 01:56:31.477
McArnold committed a bit of a Big Apple
faux pas, and Dana won't let me out it.

01:56:31.554 --> 01:56:34.717
I'm undergoing
some kind of nervous collapse.

01:56:34.791 --> 01:56:37.089
All right, so we're probably
on our own today.

01:56:37.160 --> 01:56:38.650
-- Yeah.
-- See ya.

01:56:50.673 --> 01:56:52.641
This is "Sports Night"
teaser record

01:56:52.708 --> 01:56:55.109
for VTR playback,
11/17/99.

01:56:55.178 --> 01:56:57.545
Let's call it Take 5.

01:56:57.613 --> 01:56:59.047
Let's "call it" Take 5?

01:56:59.115 --> 01:57:00.674
-- Why <i>not?</i>
-- <i>What take is it really?</i>

01:57:00.750 --> 01:57:02.514
We're up in the 30s now.

01:57:02.585 --> 01:57:03.848
Roll tape.

01:57:03.920 --> 01:57:06.582
In 3...2...

01:57:06.656 --> 01:57:10.183
Tonight on “Sports Night,“ we'll check out
Herman Moore and the Lions' new-look offense

01:57:10.259 --> 01:57:12.694
and Rob Blake and the Kings'

01:57:12.762 --> 01:57:15.026
We'll go back to the future
at Florida State

01:57:15.098 --> 01:57:18.432
and touch down in Monte Carlo as
Yevgeny Kafelnikov goes for the gold.

01:57:18.501 --> 01:57:19.991
Stay tuned for "Sports Night,"
next.

01:57:20.069 --> 01:57:21.468
-- Okay.
-- <i>I did</i> it!

01:57:21.537 --> 01:57:23.596
-- <i>Yes!</i>
-- <i>Did it, baby! Yes!</i>

01:57:23.673 --> 01:57:25.163
Let's roll tape now.

01:57:26.909 --> 01:57:27.842
What?

01:57:27.910 --> 01:57:29.639
Let's do it again, only
this time, let's record it.

01:57:29.712 --> 01:57:31.646
We weren't recording it?

01:57:31.714 --> 01:57:32.840
No.

01:57:32.915 --> 01:57:35.213
-- I thought we were rolling.
-- We weren't.

01:57:35.284 --> 01:57:37.981
-- I <i>saw you hit the button.</i>
-- <i>Grazed</i> it <i>with my fingers.</i>

01:57:38.054 --> 01:57:40.648
Why weren't we recording it?

01:57:40.723 --> 01:57:42.782
-- Isaac doesn't like to waste tape.
-- Jeremy!

01:57:42.859 --> 01:57:44.520
Come on, come on, dry run, dry run.
Here we go.

01:57:47.630 --> 01:57:49.064
-- You're rolling?
-- Yes.

01:57:49.132 --> 01:57:51.066
-- Really?
-- Yes.

01:57:53.336 --> 01:57:55.464
<i>Tonight on "Sports Night,"</i>

01:57:55.538 --> 01:57:58.200
we'll check out Herman Moore
and the Lions' new-look offense

01:57:58.274 --> 01:58:00.834
and Rob Blake and the Kings'
old-school defense.

01:58:00.910 --> 01:58:03.277
We'll go back to the future
at Florida State

01:58:03.346 --> 01:58:05.314
and touch down
in Monte Carlo as --

01:58:07.250 --> 01:58:09.218
-- I'm outta here.
-- Where are you going?

01:58:09.285 --> 01:58:10.980
I've got to go see someone.

01:58:11.053 --> 01:58:13.988
Bubba Smith and Chipper Jones
would work fine in the teaser.

01:58:14.056 --> 01:58:14.989
[Door closes]

01:58:15.057 --> 01:58:18.049
Yevgeny Kafelnikov --
I did it. No problem.

01:58:18.127 --> 01:58:20.960
I'm talking to myself
for no particular reason.

01:58:21.030 --> 01:58:22.759
[Smacks lips]

01:58:22.832 --> 01:58:24.630
Isaac?

01:58:24.700 --> 01:58:25.861
Yeah?

01:58:25.935 --> 01:58:26.868
-- How you doin'?
-- Good.

01:58:26.936 --> 01:58:28.131
I've got a problem.

01:58:28.204 --> 01:58:30.138
-- Imagine my surprise.
-- Right.

01:58:30.206 --> 01:58:31.901
Shane McArnold, some years ago,

01:58:31.974 --> 01:58:34.375
he gave me an interview
when I needed a break.

01:58:34.443 --> 01:58:35.706
Are you with me?

01:58:35.778 --> 01:58:38.270
Yeah, but so far,
I'm not at all interested.

01:58:38.347 --> 01:58:40.611
-- He was my “Close-Up“ interview
this morning. -- How'd he do?

01:58:40.683 --> 01:58:41.946
Very, very well.

01:58:42.018 --> 01:58:44.646
We got lots of footage,
feet and feet of footage.

01:58:44.720 --> 01:58:47.155
-- There's just this little
spot where he says... -- Yes?

01:58:47.223 --> 01:58:49.783
I mean, it's possible
to interpret his remarks as --

01:58:49.859 --> 01:58:51.759
He implies he doesn't like
New York.

01:58:51.827 --> 01:58:53.886
-- <i>How?</i> -- <i>By saying he
doesn't like New York.</i>

01:58:53.963 --> 01:58:54.896
Wow.

01:58:54.964 --> 01:58:55.897
Yeah.

01:58:55.965 --> 01:58:57.660
-- He's screwed.
-- Yes.

01:58:57.733 --> 01:58:58.825
Wow. [Laughs]

01:58:58.901 --> 01:59:02.531
How do you feel about
my editing out that section?

01:59:02.605 --> 01:59:05.404
Well, I guess, since it's news
and it's good television,

01:59:05.474 --> 01:59:07.203
I wouldn't feel very good
about it.

01:59:07.276 --> 01:59:09.745
-- How do you think Dana would
feel about it? -- Dana?

01:59:09.812 --> 01:59:11.075
Yeah.

01:59:11.147 --> 01:59:12.239
Well, who knows with Dana?

01:59:12.315 --> 01:59:13.874
One day she's up,
another day she's down.

01:59:13.950 --> 01:59:16.385
That girl's nuttier than
a squirrel's cheeks in October.

01:59:16.452 --> 01:59:17.715
The point is --

01:59:17.787 --> 01:59:19.619
She's standing
right behind me, right?

01:59:19.689 --> 01:59:22.420
I cannot believe you.
You went over my head?

01:59:22.491 --> 01:59:23.720
-- I can explain this.
-- How?

01:59:23.793 --> 01:59:26.057
-- I went over your head.
-- <i>Casey!</i>

01:59:26.128 --> 01:59:27.618
Hey, I'm just trying
to be courteous, okay?

01:59:27.697 --> 01:59:29.096
I didn't want to interrupt
your dancing.

01:59:29.165 --> 01:59:31.031
And you just sat there?!

01:59:31.100 --> 01:59:32.568
It's my desk.

01:59:32.635 --> 01:59:33.864
Outside!

01:59:33.936 --> 01:59:36.564
-- Right.
-- Good talking to you, Case.

01:59:36.639 --> 01:59:38.129
Listen, does the fact that I --

01:59:38.207 --> 01:59:40.266
-- He's an old friend.
-- Move it.

01:59:40.343 --> 01:59:43.278
He gave me my first break. Okay, I can see
you're upset because I went over your head.

01:59:43.346 --> 01:59:45.713
Well, you never know with me,
do you, Casey?

01:59:45.781 --> 01:59:47.112
One day I'm up,
one day I'm down.

01:59:47.183 --> 01:59:50.050
Hey, listen, first of all,
sorry about that.

01:59:50.119 --> 01:59:51.848
Second of all, he's a good guy.

01:59:51.921 --> 01:59:54.049
He gave me my start,
and I owe him one.

01:59:54.123 --> 01:59:55.989
This is personal.
You can understand that.

01:59:56.058 --> 01:59:58.356
Let me tell you something --
I think it's really sweet

01:59:58.427 --> 01:59:59.417
that you're that loyal
to someone.

01:59:59.495 --> 02:00:03.090
It says a lot about you, and it's
almost hard to choke back the tears

02:00:03.165 --> 02:00:05.224
while I say...no!

02:00:05.301 --> 02:00:06.359
Dana --

02:00:06.435 --> 02:00:08.961
Excuse me, everyone,
I'd like to announce

02:00:09.038 --> 02:00:12.008
that Casey's adolescent
and pathetic hero worship

02:00:12.074 --> 02:00:14.873
of professional athletes
has reached the point

02:00:14.944 --> 02:00:18.608
where he's willing to compromise
journalistic integrity.

02:00:18.681 --> 02:00:20.445
Oh, please.
Journalistic integrity?

02:00:20.516 --> 02:00:22.006
Like we're Edward R. Murrow.

02:00:22.084 --> 02:00:25.748
He just signed
a $91-million contract, Casey.

02:00:25.821 --> 02:00:27.550
Something tells me
he's gonna get over it.

02:00:27.623 --> 02:00:30.058
Yeah, he makes a lot more money
than we do,

02:00:30.126 --> 02:00:33.494
so let's look for every possible
opportunity to blow him out of the water.

02:00:33.562 --> 02:00:35.963
-- VVas he aware a camera
was pointed at him? -- Yes.

02:00:36.032 --> 02:00:38.194
-- VVas he aware that we were
recording sound? -- Yes.

02:00:38.267 --> 02:00:41.794
-- VVas he aware that we intended
this for public broadcast? -- Yes!

02:00:41.871 --> 02:00:45.136
-- Tell me how I'm blowing him out of
the water. -- It's just not necessary.

02:00:45.207 --> 02:00:46.697
Neither is sports,

02:00:46.776 --> 02:00:48.676
and please don't go to Isaac
behind my back.

02:00:48.744 --> 02:00:50.803
That just makes me get...
[Grunts] like this.

02:00:50.880 --> 02:00:52.348
Fine.

02:00:52.415 --> 02:00:53.246
Go get ready.

02:01:09.632 --> 02:01:11.498
[Sighs]

02:01:16.772 --> 02:01:18.206
-- Hi.
-- Danny.

02:01:18.274 --> 02:01:19.605
-- I'm sorry to interrupt. --
I'm in the middle of a session.

02:01:19.675 --> 02:01:22.542
-- I'm having a problem. -- So is my
patient, Danny, so I'll talk to you later.

02:01:22.611 --> 02:01:24.545
-- How you doin'?
-- Okay.

02:01:24.613 --> 02:01:26.342
-- <i>I'm</i> Dan <i>Rydell.</i>
-- <i>From "Sports Night."</i>

02:01:26.415 --> 02:01:28.440
-- You watch the show?
-- I love the show.

02:01:28.517 --> 02:01:29.484
-- You hear that?
-- Danny.

02:01:29.552 --> 02:01:31.350
Say, listen, I-I'm sorry,

02:01:31.420 --> 02:01:33.912
but you weren't in the middle of a
breakthrough or anything, were you?

02:01:33.989 --> 02:01:35.787
-- Hey!
-- Why? You need a minute?

02:01:35.858 --> 02:01:37.257
You're the best.

02:01:43.332 --> 02:01:44.891
I'm having a problem.

02:01:44.967 --> 02:01:47.868
<i>That was so totally, unbelievably,
off-the-charts out of fine</i> --

02:01:47.937 --> 02:01:50.804
-- Yeah, yeah, listen -- this is an
emergency. -- <i>What?</i> What's wrong?

02:01:50.873 --> 02:01:53.672
I can't say Yevgeny Kafelnikov.

02:01:53.743 --> 02:01:55.177
What?

02:01:55.244 --> 02:01:58.407
He's a Russian tennis player. I'm recording
the tease, and I-l can't pronounce his name.

02:01:58.481 --> 02:01:59.812
I invert two of the syllables.

02:01:59.882 --> 02:02:00.906
One of the times,
I got it right,

02:02:00.983 --> 02:02:02.473
but Jeremy wasn't rolling
the tape.

02:02:02.551 --> 02:02:04.417
-- I'm calling the police.
-- Abby, I'm serious --

02:02:04.487 --> 02:02:06.785
You interrupted my session because you
can't pronounce Yevgeny Kafelnikov?

02:02:06.856 --> 02:02:08.688
-- I need to know why.
-- How the hell should I know?

02:02:08.758 --> 02:02:10.954
Enough of this already.
Just fix me, would you?

02:02:11.026 --> 02:02:12.187
-- Fix you?
-- Please?

02:02:12.294 --> 02:02:13.056
Okay.

02:02:13.095 --> 02:02:14.358
<i>Pf“!</i>

02:02:14.430 --> 02:02:15.363
All done.

02:02:15.431 --> 02:02:17.422
Okay, I don't think
you did anything just then.

02:02:17.500 --> 02:02:20.197
Danny, of all the psychological
problems you have --

02:02:20.269 --> 02:02:23.569
and they are myriad -- not being
able to pronounce Yevgeny Kafelnikov

02:02:23.639 --> 02:02:25.107
-- isn't one of them. -- Then
why can't I pronounce it?

02:02:25.174 --> 02:02:26.471
'Cause it's a hard name
to pronounce.

02:02:26.542 --> 02:02:27.566
Abby, I'm --

02:02:27.643 --> 02:02:29.338
This is very unfair
to my patient.

02:02:29.412 --> 02:02:32.313
Look, something is going on with
me, and I know you can fix it,

02:02:32.381 --> 02:02:34.611
and, frankly -- and I'm sorry if this is
abrupt -- but I think the only reason

02:02:34.683 --> 02:02:36.708
you're stringing me around like this is
that you're afraid if I get over this,

02:02:36.786 --> 02:02:37.947
I won't have a reason
to see you.

02:02:38.020 --> 02:02:41.615
Danny...y0u're in pain, and it
doesn't take a genius to see that.

02:02:41.690 --> 02:02:43.658
-- I'm perfectly fine.
-- True or false --

02:02:43.726 --> 02:02:45.626
the only time you're really
comfortable with people

02:02:45.694 --> 02:02:47.389
is when you're talking to them
on television.

02:02:47.463 --> 02:02:48.897
-- That is untrue.
-- True or false --

02:02:48.964 --> 02:02:50.432
you're convinced
you're responsible

02:02:50.499 --> 02:02:51.762
-- for the death of your brother.
-- Look, I don't need you --

02:02:51.834 --> 02:02:54.326
True or false -- you're convinced
your parents blame you as well.

02:02:54.403 --> 02:02:56.701
This is starting to get
a little personal, Abby.

02:02:56.772 --> 02:02:58.103
Fine. Go back to work.

02:03:10.853 --> 02:03:12.912
[Sighs]

02:03:15.024 --> 02:03:17.789
Why is this happening now?

02:03:17.860 --> 02:03:19.294
I don't know.

02:03:19.361 --> 02:03:20.556
You do know.

02:03:20.629 --> 02:03:22.256
I honestly don't.

02:03:24.767 --> 02:03:28.135
Y-You saw a picture,
you missed a birthday,

02:03:28.204 --> 02:03:30.138
you heard a song --
who knows?

02:03:30.206 --> 02:03:31.765
Maybe it's just
enough is enough,

02:03:31.841 --> 02:03:33.809
and it's time for your mind
to deal with it.

02:03:33.876 --> 02:03:35.366
Whatever the reason, it's here.

02:03:35.444 --> 02:03:40.006
Now, does this really sound like something
I could just fix with a prescription?

02:03:46.989 --> 02:03:49.117
So what do I do?

02:03:49.191 --> 02:03:51.285
You get therapy -- for real.

02:03:51.360 --> 02:03:53.624
With you?

02:03:55.698 --> 02:03:58.224
Yeah, if you like.

02:03:58.300 --> 02:04:00.132
-- Really?
-- Yeah.

02:04:02.204 --> 02:04:04.605
I just call up
and make an appointment?

02:04:04.673 --> 02:04:06.573
That's right.

02:04:06.642 --> 02:04:08.633
-- The thing is,

02:04:08.711 --> 02:04:10.645
-- Yeah? -- there, uh,
may be a problem there.

02:04:10.713 --> 02:04:12.044
You have a crush on me.

02:04:12.114 --> 02:04:13.513
-- Yeah.
-- That's natural.

02:04:13.582 --> 02:04:15.573
I guess
'cause you're the healer,

02:04:15.651 --> 02:04:17.949
and you're also playing the role
of the confessor as well.

02:04:18.020 --> 02:04:21.081
-- I meant 'cause I'm a babe.
-- That, too.

02:04:21.156 --> 02:04:23.147
-- Danny...
-- Yeah?

02:04:23.225 --> 02:04:25.592
...you're gonna be fine.

02:04:25.661 --> 02:04:28.130
It doesn't feel that way.

02:04:28.197 --> 02:04:30.689
I know.
Have a good show.

02:04:32.768 --> 02:04:34.702
[Door opens]

02:04:34.770 --> 02:04:37.137
[Sighs ] Thanks.

02:04:39.108 --> 02:04:40.303
Thanks a lot.
I appreciate it.

02:04:40.376 --> 02:04:42.037
I love watching you
on television.

02:04:42.111 --> 02:04:43.340
Thanks.

[indistinct conversations]

02:04:54.490 --> 02:04:56.424
-- You see this spoon?
-- Yeah.

02:04:56.492 --> 02:04:58.426
-- I'm stealing it.
-- Okay. Why?

02:04:58.494 --> 02:05:01.156
-- No, no, Jeremy, I think the better
question is “why not?“ -- Okay.

02:05:01.230 --> 02:05:03.164
-- Will I be punished for it?
-- I doubt it.

02:05:03.232 --> 02:05:05.701
-- Me too. -- When did people
start eating a lot of hummus?

02:05:05.768 --> 02:05:07.293
Let's say I Was punished for it.

02:05:07.369 --> 02:05:09.929
Let's say I was taken down to the
station house for stealing this spoon,

02:05:10.005 --> 02:05:12.372
-- and as a result of that,
I lost my job. -- Yes.

02:05:12.441 --> 02:05:13.772
I wouldn't have any money.

02:05:13.842 --> 02:05:15.003
You'd get another job.

02:05:15.077 --> 02:05:16.841
With my rap sheet?
I don't think so.

02:05:16.912 --> 02:05:18.141
You stole a spoon.

02:05:18.213 --> 02:05:19.942
Today it's a spoon,
tomorrow it's a bank.

02:05:20.015 --> 02:05:23.246
-- You're gonna steal a bank?
-- I'm gonna rob a bank.

02:05:23.319 --> 02:05:25.754
She's actually not gonna rob
a bank.

02:05:25.821 --> 02:05:28.552
This is just sort of
a hypothetical flight of fancy.

02:05:28.624 --> 02:05:30.592
Resume your late-night
socializing.

02:05:30.659 --> 02:05:33.185
-- Jeremy -- -- Natalie, fear
of punishment has never been

02:05:33.262 --> 02:05:35.060
what's kept you
from committing a crime.

02:05:35.130 --> 02:05:37.428
The reason you haven't robbed a
bank is that you know it's wrong.

02:05:37.499 --> 02:05:39.024
The reason you're not gonna
steal that spoon

02:05:39.101 --> 02:05:40.569
is because you know it's wrong.

02:05:40.636 --> 02:05:43.037
So Hell isn't
a Hieronymus Bosch painting.

02:05:43.105 --> 02:05:45.767
What do you care?
You weren't going there anyway.

you know that?

for you, messing with me like that?

Hey, man,
I didn't mess with you.

-- You said that you'd fix it.
-- I know.

02:06:04.326 --> 02:06:06.818
I should never have made
that promise.

02:06:06.895 --> 02:06:10.456
Truth is, I don't have that
kind of authority on the show,

02:06:10.532 --> 02:06:12.466
and I pretended like I did.

-- Let me buy you a beer.
-- Buy me a beer?

02:06:14.403 --> 02:06:15.928
This guy wants to buy me a beer.

02:06:16.005 --> 02:06:17.495
I should kick your ass.

You just stay out of my face,

02:06:30.653 --> 02:06:32.849

You're gonna roam

If you can't get excited
about that,

Just takin' care of business.
Where you been?

You want to find someplace
and talk about it?

Hey, do you think
it would be okay if I, um...

02:07:28.444 --> 02:07:30.674
just sat down...

02:07:30.746 --> 02:07:33.875
and...and just sat down
for a while?

02:07:33.949 --> 02:07:36.111
Of course it's okay.
What's goin' on?

that you get every attractive
woman you meet to like you?

all right? Enough is enough.
