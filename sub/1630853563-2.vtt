WEBVTT

00:15.375 --> 00:17.750
-Whoa!

00:19.500 --> 00:20.833
Ah!

00:26.833 --> 00:28.000
Ah, no!

00:28.083 --> 00:29.041
Huh?

00:30.875 --> 00:31.708
Ah!

00:32.583 --> 00:33.416
Ouch.

00:45.958 --> 00:47.500
-Hey.

00:49.791 --> 00:52.458
<i>Thank you</i>
<i>for visiting Phoenix Parks.</i>

00:52.541 --> 00:56.250
<i>I hope y'all come back soon.</i>
<i>Safe trip! Take care now.</i>

00:56.333 --> 00:57.375
<i>Don't sue.</i>

00:58.458 --> 00:59.666
Please say cheese.

01:00.708 --> 01:03.458
Next. Say cheese.

01:04.583 --> 01:06.083
-Next.

01:06.166 --> 01:09.750
Thank you.
Okay. Say cheese.

01:10.333 --> 01:13.125
-And next.
-Come on, little girl.

01:14.916 --> 01:15.916
Come on.

01:17.750 --> 01:20.208
-Oh, come on, Norma.

01:20.291 --> 01:22.333
-Norma?

01:22.416 --> 01:24.000
It's okay, blossom.

01:24.083 --> 01:26.625
Buster Scruffs wants to meet ya.

01:26.708 --> 01:27.708
Hello!

01:28.416 --> 01:31.916
So sorry, why is the line
not moving? Is there a problem?

01:37.291 --> 01:39.708
What's wrong, little girl?

01:39.791 --> 01:42.625
What's wrong?

01:50.125 --> 01:52.125
Hmm?

02:16.583 --> 02:20.041
Okay, okay, okay, okay. Now say "door."

02:20.125 --> 02:23.166
-Door.

02:23.250 --> 02:25.458
Okay, okay. Uh, now say "pumpkin."

02:26.041 --> 02:27.291
Uh… Pumpkin.

02:29.500 --> 02:30.541
Oh, oh, okay.

02:30.625 --> 02:34.750
Now say, mmm, "indubitably."

02:34.833 --> 02:36.208
In-jupitoo-boop-bo.

02:36.750 --> 02:38.083
Indubi-tu-poo-tep.

02:38.708 --> 02:41.083
Indubiti-bark-ffrt-ai-ha!

02:41.166 --> 02:43.333
-Okay, say it again. Say it again.

02:43.416 --> 02:45.875
-Oh, Pugsley. One more go.
-Indu--

02:47.541 --> 02:50.083
What the heck is going on here?

02:51.166 --> 02:53.625
Despite your valiant efforts
to rid me of my demonic curse,

02:53.708 --> 02:56.500
it appears I still have the ability
to talk to people if I--

02:57.041 --> 03:00.083
-How did you get here before me?
-Uh…

03:00.166 --> 03:01.583
Were you here all night?

03:01.666 --> 03:03.708
Uh, good question,

03:03.791 --> 03:07.416
but wouldn't you rather, uh,
ask Pugsley a question?

03:07.500 --> 03:10.125
Like why do dogs sniff each other's butts?

03:10.208 --> 03:11.458
Well, let me explain.

03:11.541 --> 03:14.541
For dogs, one smell
is worth a thousand barks.

03:15.625 --> 03:18.500
For instance, Norma,
I know you had eggs for breakfast.

03:18.583 --> 03:20.375
Ha! Wrong.

03:20.458 --> 03:22.708
Two days ago, with avocado and…

03:22.791 --> 03:24.750
-Huh?
-…chili flakes.

03:24.833 --> 03:26.166
-How could you--

03:26.250 --> 03:28.333
Ah! Ah! Stop it!

03:28.416 --> 03:31.625
Well, I could listen to you
all day long, Pugsley.

03:31.708 --> 03:33.416
All these years,
I've been blabbering on to you.

03:33.500 --> 03:35.875
It's about time you got a chance
to say something back.

03:35.958 --> 03:38.000
Would you like to know
what your butt smells tell me?

03:38.083 --> 03:39.166
Ugh. Ah!

03:39.250 --> 03:40.708
-Stop doing that.

03:41.500 --> 03:44.625
This is all the stuff that the old
Dead End employees had on 'em

03:44.708 --> 03:46.250
when they die…

03:46.791 --> 03:48.291
Disappeared.

03:48.375 --> 03:50.375
Mysteriously.

03:50.458 --> 03:53.583
-Might help you blend in.

03:55.833 --> 03:57.000
Ugh.

03:59.416 --> 04:00.250
Huh?

04:00.333 --> 04:02.708
Hmm. Ugh, nah.

04:03.750 --> 04:04.583
Ah!

04:06.000 --> 04:07.791
Ooh, a fez.

04:08.833 --> 04:09.666
Mmm.

04:10.583 --> 04:11.958
Ooh! That's lucky.

04:12.041 --> 04:14.583
Park pass. Great, we need that.

04:14.666 --> 04:16.458
Oh. Yeah, right.

04:16.541 --> 04:18.791
I was talking about this.

04:18.916 --> 04:21.291
Ew, powdered gravy mix?

04:21.375 --> 04:22.208
Lunch!

04:22.791 --> 04:25.166
-Ah!
-Mmm!

04:25.250 --> 04:26.125
Ugh.

04:26.666 --> 04:29.041
Barney,
do you know what this means?

04:29.125 --> 04:31.625
Uh, your new name is Jennifer?

04:31.708 --> 04:36.541
No, a gold pass means
all access to every part of the park.

04:36.625 --> 04:38.875
You mean we could go
on every ride, every restaurant,

04:38.958 --> 04:40.916
every secret location whenever we want?

04:41.000 --> 04:43.166
Yeah, but first…

04:43.250 --> 04:45.500
Mandatory employee initiation!

04:49.541 --> 04:50.375
Huh.

04:52.625 --> 04:55.125
Hello, newbies. Welcome to Phoenix Parks.

04:55.208 --> 04:57.833
My name is Badyah Hassan
and I'll be your guide today--

04:57.916 --> 04:59.916
Oh, uh, okay. Uh, yes?

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
When will we get to meet Pauline Phoenix?

05:02.083 --> 05:06.208
Uh, well, she doesn't usually
come to staff meetings.

05:06.291 --> 05:07.375
She's a very busy woman.

05:08.041 --> 05:09.958
Barney, did you hear that? She's busy.

05:10.041 --> 05:11.708
That means a new album is coming.

05:11.791 --> 05:14.375
Ugh. How long is this gonna go on for?

05:14.458 --> 05:16.541
Oh, I'm hoping for the three-hour version.

05:25.208 --> 05:26.666
Sorry to keep you waiting.

05:26.750 --> 05:28.541
Hi, I'm Logan Nguyen.

05:28.625 --> 05:32.041
Yeah, the three-hour version
sounds great to me.

05:32.125 --> 05:34.958
Ugh. That's like a full day in dog hours.

05:35.041 --> 05:37.250
Oh, neat. Is that a new mascot?

05:37.333 --> 05:39.458
-No, I'm Pugsley.
-Uh, yeah.

05:39.541 --> 05:42.750
Norma, I'm sure you've got
some great mascot facts, right?

05:42.833 --> 05:45.958
Well, they retired all the original
mascots about ten years ago…

05:46.041 --> 05:48.416
I thought
you were excited that I could talk.

05:48.500 --> 05:49.625
Oh, yeah, totally.

05:49.708 --> 05:52.833
Just… just not here, or in public.

05:52.916 --> 05:54.458
We can talk all you like at home.

05:54.541 --> 05:56.625
Oh. Okay.

05:56.708 --> 05:59.250
Listen, buddy,
after all that happened yesterday,

05:59.333 --> 06:01.750
your safety is my first priority.

06:01.833 --> 06:03.708
I am not gonna leave your side.

06:03.791 --> 06:05.500
Okay, who wants to be my partner?

06:05.583 --> 06:06.750
Hi, I'm Barney.

06:08.375 --> 06:11.000
Oh, hi, Barney. What do you do?

06:11.083 --> 06:15.958
Oh, uh, I work out.
I travel. I'm a foodie.

06:16.041 --> 06:18.583
No, no, I mean at the park.

06:18.666 --> 06:22.125
Uh, yeah.

06:23.375 --> 06:25.458
-Huh?
-Will we do the original Starter Tour?

06:25.541 --> 06:27.500
Or the slightly revised Starter Tour 2.0,

06:27.583 --> 06:29.750
which includes
the customer service simulator?

06:30.333 --> 06:33.125
Maybe you would like
to lead the tour yourself.

06:34.125 --> 06:36.958
Good morning, everyone.
I'll be your guide, Norma.

06:37.041 --> 06:39.666
And in a moment,
we'll be boarding the monorail.

06:39.750 --> 06:42.125
I was joking, but sure, go ahead.

06:42.208 --> 06:46.125
This is the model S426B,
introduced 14 years ago.

06:46.208 --> 06:48.291
Note the faulty
air conditioning.

06:48.375 --> 06:51.625
Okay, everybody aboard
the mandatory initiation express.

06:52.833 --> 06:54.958
Barney, Barney, Barney, Barney.

06:55.041 --> 06:56.166
Those doors are horrible.

06:56.250 --> 06:59.083
They're even worse than the hand dryers
at the Dinosaur Restaurant.

06:59.166 --> 07:01.208
Keep it down.

07:01.291 --> 07:03.875
-What was that?
-Nothing, nothing.

07:03.958 --> 07:07.500
I sometimes, I just…
I talk to myself, not in like a weird way.

07:07.583 --> 07:10.125
In, like, a really, really,
really cool way.

07:10.208 --> 07:11.041
Ugh.

07:15.916 --> 07:18.250
Meat.

07:18.333 --> 07:20.250
Meat.

07:20.333 --> 07:24.666
Welcome, everybody,
to the new Starter 2.0, the Extended Cut.

07:24.750 --> 07:28.625
Settle in and let's get the show
on the road, or should I say rail?

07:30.083 --> 07:31.416
Here we go.

07:31.500 --> 07:33.750
On your left,
you'll see the Western Walkway,

07:33.833 --> 07:36.500
inspired by Pauline's early…

07:38.250 --> 07:41.791
…and that's why Pauline
never worked in Hollywood again.

07:41.875 --> 07:45.916
On that note, we've come to the end
of the extended Starter Tour 2.0.

07:46.000 --> 07:48.541
I hope you've all had a blast.
I know I have!

07:48.625 --> 07:50.708
Yeah, I probably
shouldn't have allowed that.

07:50.791 --> 07:53.291
Is it me or did that seem really long?

07:53.375 --> 07:55.916
Oh, uh, did it? I didn't notice.

07:58.708 --> 08:00.208
Okay.

08:00.291 --> 08:02.500
Come on, Pugsley. You can do this.

08:04.083 --> 08:05.000
-Okay.
-Uh, Barney?

08:05.083 --> 08:06.791
To wrap things up, let's do a pop quiz.

08:06.875 --> 08:08.625
Barney. Barney. Barney…

08:08.708 --> 08:11.750
…guest on fire, should you,
A, leave them alone.

08:11.833 --> 08:14.083
B, refund their ticket. C, ask…

08:16.791 --> 08:21.833
I want to get off!

09:00.083 --> 09:02.125
-Oh! What was that?

09:03.166 --> 09:04.416
Hello?

09:04.500 --> 09:05.583
-Ah!

09:06.791 --> 09:07.750
Oh, no.

09:07.833 --> 09:09.833
-Okay.

09:15.125 --> 09:18.583
Okay. Oh, no. Okay.

09:19.166 --> 09:20.916
This is not okay.

09:28.666 --> 09:30.208
Huh?

09:31.958 --> 09:36.291
And remember, as Pauline always says,
if you see anything suspicious…

09:36.375 --> 09:38.541
Just keep it to yourself, darlin'.

09:40.375 --> 09:42.541
Meat!

09:43.291 --> 09:45.250
-Huh?

09:45.333 --> 09:46.333
-Huh?
-Uh…

09:46.416 --> 09:48.541
-It got Josh! It got Josh!

09:49.708 --> 09:50.833
Barney, quick!

09:51.458 --> 09:52.875
-But he's got Josh.

09:54.708 --> 09:55.875
Barney, come on!

10:03.500 --> 10:06.375
Wait, where's Pugsley?
I need to go back and get him.

10:06.458 --> 10:08.208
Barney, we have to keep going.

10:08.291 --> 10:10.166
No! Pugsley could be in danger.

10:10.250 --> 10:12.291
If we go back up there,
we'll be in danger too!

10:12.375 --> 10:13.583
-But he's gone.
-Barney.

10:13.666 --> 10:16.916
If you want to find Pugsley,
we have to find another way out of here.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.708
What is this place?

10:31.791 --> 10:33.125
This is the under-park,

10:33.208 --> 10:36.750
an ingenious network of tunnels
with secret entrances hidden everywhere!

10:36.833 --> 10:38.291
How do you know about all this?

10:38.375 --> 10:42.208
I didn't spend ten years
obsessing over old park maps for nothing.

10:42.291 --> 10:45.708
Uh, I see why they leave
this part off the tour.

11:06.166 --> 11:08.333
Hey, mortals.

11:08.416 --> 11:09.666
Courtney?

11:11.875 --> 11:13.291
How's your first day going?

11:13.375 --> 11:16.250
Ugh, we're being chased
by a flesh-eating monster.

11:16.333 --> 11:18.833
Ooh, so pretty good, right?

11:18.916 --> 11:21.083
Wait, is that Pugsley's hat?

11:21.166 --> 11:23.291
Huh? I don't know.
I just found it back there.

11:23.375 --> 11:24.750
Show me.

11:43.791 --> 11:46.583
Oh, please just eat me quickly.
Eat me quickly.

11:48.333 --> 11:50.916
Huh? Wait, you're…

11:51.458 --> 11:52.458
You're mascots?

11:53.041 --> 11:55.041
Meat.

11:56.750 --> 11:58.708
Meat.

11:59.333 --> 12:02.500
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Don't eat kids.

12:02.583 --> 12:05.000
If you're hungry,
I can get you some dog chow.

12:05.083 --> 12:06.125
It's 5% meat.

12:06.916 --> 12:09.458
Meat!

12:15.708 --> 12:17.041
Oh!

12:19.375 --> 12:22.791
And here we go.
This is where I found the hat.

12:22.875 --> 12:24.666
Don't say I never take you anywhere nice.

12:26.208 --> 12:27.833
Isn't this place amazing?

12:32.958 --> 12:35.500
Wow! I never thought I'd get to see these.

12:35.583 --> 12:38.250
So clever, so utilitarian.

12:38.333 --> 12:40.583
-Meat!
-Huh?

12:41.625 --> 12:45.000
Oh, Pugsley.
What if I never get to see him again?

12:45.083 --> 12:47.083
Guys, guys, you gotta come see this.

12:47.166 --> 12:50.583
-Meat.
-Meat.

12:51.125 --> 12:52.625
-That's it. That's it.

12:52.708 --> 12:55.250
No need to push.
There's room for everyone.

12:55.333 --> 12:57.250
Psst, Pugsley. Pugsley, over here.

12:57.333 --> 13:00.333
-Oh, hey, Barney, how'd--

13:00.416 --> 13:02.041
Behind you.

13:02.750 --> 13:06.333
Oh, oh, yeah. I know.
I'm helping them get what they truly want.

13:06.416 --> 13:07.708
What are you doing?

13:07.791 --> 13:10.000
Yeah, I just told you that.

13:10.083 --> 13:11.958
All the mascots want is to go out and--

13:12.041 --> 13:14.083
This is very bad, Pugsley.

13:14.166 --> 13:15.125
Bad Pugsley!

13:15.208 --> 13:18.000
Me bad? You abandoned me.

13:18.083 --> 13:19.791
-Bad Barney!
-Bad Pugsley.

13:19.875 --> 13:21.625
-Bad Barney.
-Bad Pugsley.

13:21.708 --> 13:23.916
-Bad Barney.
-No, bad Pugsley.

13:24.000 --> 13:26.541
-Bad Barney! Bad Barney!
-Bad Pugsley! Bad Pugsley!

13:26.625 --> 13:28.625
-Bad Barney!
-Oh, you're impossible!

13:28.708 --> 13:32.708
Why can't you just be
like you used to be?

13:33.958 --> 13:35.666
You know what, Barney?

13:35.750 --> 13:37.583
You sound just like Grammy Gram.

13:50.083 --> 13:52.916
Okay, guys, time for your comeback!

13:53.000 --> 13:55.875
Meat!

13:57.750 --> 14:00.083
I heard Jennifer Swan
joined a traveling theater group.

14:01.125 --> 14:04.375
I'm sure I saw her working
at Frank's Dune Buggy Emporium.

14:08.708 --> 14:10.208
Okay?

14:16.500 --> 14:19.125
Look, Grandpa!
It's Barf the Bear.

14:19.208 --> 14:22.833
I remember these old mascots
from back in my day.

14:22.916 --> 14:24.875
Hello.

14:27.416 --> 14:29.666
Meat!

14:30.291 --> 14:32.250
-I don't recall them doing that.

14:35.333 --> 14:37.833
-Mmm-hmm? What can I get ya?

14:38.375 --> 14:40.583
-Meat!

14:40.666 --> 14:42.916
-Meat!

14:43.000 --> 14:45.833
Meat! Meat!

14:47.500 --> 14:50.291
Oops. Bad Pugsley.

14:59.083 --> 15:00.416
I can't believe that dog.

15:00.500 --> 15:03.083
I do not sound like Grammy Gram.

15:03.166 --> 15:04.250
Quick.

15:04.333 --> 15:07.083
We gotta find Pugsley
before he does something stupid.

15:07.666 --> 15:09.833
-Meat!
-Too late.

15:12.250 --> 15:13.708
Barney, this is bad.

15:14.250 --> 15:17.541
Bad. Yeah, he called me bad,
can you believe that?

15:17.625 --> 15:19.291
I'm the only one
that knows what he's going through.

15:19.375 --> 15:20.541
I'm just trying to protect him.

15:20.625 --> 15:23.291
Wait, you're trying
to protect him?

15:23.375 --> 15:24.791
By hiding him away?

15:24.875 --> 15:26.250
Yeah, what's wrong with that? Ugh!

15:26.333 --> 15:28.250
Why can't he go back to my Pugsley, and--

15:28.333 --> 15:29.875
-Hold it!

15:29.958 --> 15:31.000
-Wait.
-Oh, no.

15:32.750 --> 15:34.416
I <i>do</i> sound like Grammy Gram.

15:37.041 --> 15:39.541
-Meat.

15:44.791 --> 15:46.500
Meat!

15:46.583 --> 15:48.708
-What now?
-Uh… See ya.

15:49.833 --> 15:51.208
Eh. Fair enough.

15:51.291 --> 15:53.375
-Meat.
-Ah!

15:53.458 --> 15:55.208
Meat!

15:55.291 --> 15:56.750
No, no, no, no, no.

15:56.833 --> 15:58.625
No, please. No!

15:59.916 --> 16:02.375
Meat. Meat.

16:02.458 --> 16:03.916
Someone please!

16:07.541 --> 16:08.500
Huh?

16:12.583 --> 16:14.541
You're welcome.

16:14.625 --> 16:17.791
"Fur-ever pals."

16:17.875 --> 16:19.291
Meet!

16:19.375 --> 16:21.750
And greet.

16:21.833 --> 16:23.458
Pugsley was right!

16:23.541 --> 16:26.666
Yeah, he was right. I am a bad Barney.

16:26.750 --> 16:28.375
-Huh? No.

16:28.458 --> 16:30.166
I was talking about the mascots.

16:30.250 --> 16:33.000
They don't want to eat people.
They want to <i>meet</i> people.

16:33.583 --> 16:35.208
Meet!

16:36.708 --> 16:39.875
Oh, God. No don't… don't run.
They don't want to hurt you.

16:39.958 --> 16:42.541
They want to befriend you.
They want to meet you!

16:44.916 --> 16:46.000
Meet!

16:52.333 --> 16:53.250
Huh?

16:53.875 --> 16:55.416
-Meet!

17:01.333 --> 17:03.500
Meet!

17:03.583 --> 17:05.958
-Please, stop. Ugh.

17:06.666 --> 17:09.166
Why is nobody listening to me?

17:09.250 --> 17:11.666
I am listening to you.

17:12.375 --> 17:14.708
And I should've listened to you all along.

17:14.791 --> 17:17.333
You're right, Pugsley.
Mascots don't mean us any harm.

17:17.416 --> 17:21.916
No, Barney, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean for any of this to happen.

17:22.000 --> 17:24.500
I didn't want to create panic
across the park.

17:24.583 --> 17:27.333
-Don't worry. We've got a plan.

17:28.500 --> 17:30.750
<i>Everyone,</i>
<i>this is your one-minute warning</i>

17:30.833 --> 17:33.125
<i>for the Phoenix Parks daily mascot parade!</i>

17:33.208 --> 17:37.750
I repeat, the daily mascot parade
will be starting shortly in Main Street.

17:37.833 --> 17:38.833
Join the fun.

17:38.916 --> 17:40.916
Come on, come on, bookmarks.
Don't fail me now.

17:41.000 --> 17:43.208
<i>Yes, for the last time, I accept cookies.</i>

17:43.291 --> 17:44.291
<i>Ah, gotcha!</i>

17:44.916 --> 17:45.875
What is she doing?

17:45.958 --> 17:48.041
Oh, she's got it all figured out.

17:48.125 --> 17:50.750
And so have I. I…

17:50.833 --> 17:52.333
I won't hide you away again.

17:53.750 --> 17:55.000
Time to meet the public.

17:56.541 --> 17:57.833
What do you say?

17:58.416 --> 18:00.041
Indubitably.

18:00.625 --> 18:05.083
1982 full recording Phoenix Parks Parade,
here we go.

18:08.333 --> 18:09.958
-Meet. Huh?

18:10.041 --> 18:11.916
Meet… Oh.

18:12.000 --> 18:14.958
Meet.

18:17.375 --> 18:18.958
Meet!

18:19.541 --> 18:23.416
Meet. Meet.

18:23.500 --> 18:25.458
It's working. It's working!

18:38.291 --> 18:40.500
Smile and wave. Smile and wave.

18:46.500 --> 18:49.916
-This is more like it!

18:52.458 --> 18:53.583
Meet!

18:54.833 --> 18:56.791
What was all this about?

18:56.875 --> 18:58.791
Just keep it to yourself, darlin'.

19:00.875 --> 19:01.916
It's working!

19:02.458 --> 19:04.750
Feels like it's missing
that Pauline magic.

19:06.375 --> 19:08.166
Aha! Now we're talking.

19:19.875 --> 19:22.291
Okay, yup. In you go.

19:22.375 --> 19:24.666
Nice, yes. Nice to meet you.

19:30.875 --> 19:31.875
Aww.

19:39.708 --> 19:41.166
Ah, these stink.

19:42.291 --> 19:45.833
I'm getting chlorine
and notes of walnut,

19:45.916 --> 19:48.291
and, oh, cheese gas.

19:53.541 --> 19:56.791
This is perfect.
I could do my laundry here.

19:56.875 --> 19:59.333
-Why can't you do that at home?
-Um…

19:59.416 --> 20:01.583
So you <i>did</i> stay the night.

20:01.666 --> 20:03.666
I knew it. Why would you do that?

20:03.750 --> 20:05.750
I, uh… I…

20:06.375 --> 20:08.750
I just can't be at home right now, okay?

20:08.833 --> 20:11.125
I'm gonna stay here for a few days.
Pugsley too.

20:11.208 --> 20:13.291
I don't think that's allowed, Barney.

20:14.666 --> 20:19.291
This is the first place I've ever felt
like I could just truly be myself.

20:19.375 --> 20:21.166
But that's how I feel.

20:21.250 --> 20:23.125
I didn't think you cared about the park.

20:23.708 --> 20:26.000
It's not the park. It's…

20:26.625 --> 20:27.458
It's me.

20:28.375 --> 20:32.833
I'm trans, Norma, and everyone at school
knows and everyone at home knows,

20:32.916 --> 20:36.541
and being here,
it's like a whole new place.

20:36.625 --> 20:40.416
I can just be Barney and I can choose
if and when I tell people.

20:40.500 --> 20:42.791
I've never been happier
and that's saying something

20:42.875 --> 20:45.916
when I spent today
chased by terrifying zombie mascots.

20:46.541 --> 20:50.833
Pugsley reminded me how important it is
to live your life without apology.

20:51.375 --> 20:54.625
So I think I got to give
living here a shot. Don't you?

20:54.708 --> 20:56.458
You don't need my permission.

20:56.541 --> 20:58.583
I just wouldn't want Courtney
as a roommate.

20:59.583 --> 21:02.833
We'll be
the best of friends!

21:04.500 --> 21:06.916
Just don't touch my dead fly collection.

21:07.000 --> 21:08.541
Or my alive fly collection.

21:08.625 --> 21:09.833
Or my stamps.

21:10.750 --> 21:12.166
Okay.

21:13.708 --> 21:15.750
-Oh.

21:16.666 --> 21:17.958
What I still don't understand

21:18.041 --> 21:20.250
is how did those things come alive
in the first place?

21:20.333 --> 21:23.583
Hmm, I got a few theories.

21:36.916 --> 21:38.916
Ooh!

21:41.958 --> 21:45.125
Powers, powers, power… Yes!

21:45.791 --> 21:49.333
Temeluchus commanded
armies of empty suits of armor,

21:49.416 --> 21:52.666
piloting them with memories
like ghosts raised from the dead.

21:52.750 --> 21:54.000
Bingo!

21:54.083 --> 21:56.875
I knew I'd seen
this mascot parade somewhere.

21:56.958 --> 21:59.166
Oh, boy.

21:59.750 --> 22:02.291
You're still in that dog, Your Majesty.

22:02.375 --> 22:05.291
Just a shred, but that's enough for me.

22:05.375 --> 22:07.333
I'm going home!

22:08.291 --> 22:10.625
Hey, Courtney! Courtney!

22:10.708 --> 22:12.250
Hey, it's Pugsley!

22:12.833 --> 22:15.041
Ah! Hi!
