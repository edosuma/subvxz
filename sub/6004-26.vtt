is why they call Gamora

00:20.883 --> 00:23.137

00:23.222 --> 00:24.894

ain't nowhere to hide.

When Cosmo say Guardians
welcome back anytime,

00:56.324 --> 00:58.684

You are not the Kallusian.

01:14.961 --> 01:16.961
What gave you
the first clue, Drax?

01:17.059 --> 01:18.465
Probably your green skin.

01:18.566 --> 01:20.574
Or your weapon,
or your female proportions.

01:24.019 --> 01:25.262
Speaking of sarcasm,

01:25.332 --> 01:27.644
Quill, you got a line
on the fugitive?

01:27.891 --> 01:29.715
Quill?

01:29.902 --> 01:31.894
There's a sweet bounty
on this Kallusian loser,

01:31.972 --> 01:33.840
and Quill's been acting
like he couldn't care less.

you have a home, Altru.

03:31.238 --> 03:32.476
His head's somewhere else.

03:32.570 --> 03:34.257
And apparently so are his pants.

03:34.355 --> 03:36.679
Cosmo know. Read Quill's mind.

03:36.773 --> 03:38.609
And you actually
found something?

Earth holiday called Christmas

03:40.586 --> 03:41.976
is preoccupying.

Was special day for Quill

03:43.812 --> 03:44.945
as young malchik.

03:45.023 --> 03:46.492
Great, so Quill's missing

03:46.562 --> 03:48.351
one more stupid thing
from his childhood,

03:48.382 --> 03:49.843
and we all gotta suffer for it.

03:49.959 --> 03:53.304
Hmm, perhaps not.

distracted Quill is a liability,

03:56.573 --> 03:59.172

This is truly stupid.

03:59.275 --> 04:00.374
According to my research,

04:00.400 --> 04:02.267
Christmas is about
worshipping an evergreen

04:02.311 --> 04:03.820
that goes
by the name of "Carol."

04:03.922 --> 04:06.687
Also something about a fat
bearded man in a hoversled

04:06.820 --> 04:08.437
powered by underfed moombas.

04:08.523 --> 04:11.234
Yeah, well, according to this
Terran broadcast I picked up,

04:11.361 --> 04:13.554
it's about spectrals
creeping into your bedroom

04:13.631 --> 04:15.614
and scaring the krutack
out of you.

04:15.741 --> 04:17.951
And you know how they
worship those trees?

04:18.140 --> 04:20.428
They chop them down with axes!

04:20.531 --> 04:21.882
It's mass carnage!

04:39.109 --> 04:42.273

you don't miss Christmas?

05:53.923 --> 05:54.937
(ROCKET SHIVERING) Please.

05:54.976 --> 05:56.875
Neeza will throw me
in the dungeon.

05:56.984 --> 05:58.836
My family can't afford the bail.

05:58.984 --> 06:00.803
I'll never see them again.

06:00.952 --> 06:04.237
Save it. I'm just chasing the units.
Okay?

06:08.562 --> 06:10.078
ROCKET: If I knew the
place was this fancy,

06:10.134 --> 06:12.328
I'd have held out
for a bigger payoff.

06:12.453 --> 06:14.242
This is my house,
down in the village.

06:14.324 --> 06:16.922
Please, go there and
tell them not to sell it.

06:17.125 --> 06:20.062
Home. Home is everything.

06:23.031 --> 06:24.697

got your wanted fugitive.

06:34.332 --> 06:35.476

11:09.343 --> 11:11.148
Please join us.

11:11.328 --> 11:13.078
It's not much, I'm afraid.

11:13.170 --> 11:14.538
Neeza's bled the people dry

11:14.648 --> 11:16.781
with his fines and ransoms.

11:17.109 --> 11:18.086
Tell me about it.

11:18.115 --> 11:19.203
He totally cheated us

11:19.253 --> 11:20.906
out of our bounty
for nabbing your husband.

11:20.955 --> 11:21.906
Ow!

11:22.099 --> 11:23.961
(GASPS) Is this true?

11:24.089 --> 11:25.875
Kinda. We were misled,

11:25.938 --> 11:28.227
but we're going to make it
right and free your husband.

11:28.391 --> 11:30.703
Yeah, yeah, then we're gonna
clean out Neeza's vault

11:30.752 --> 11:31.843
and get what's owed us.

11:31.937 --> 11:33.102
Ow!

11:33.257 --> 11:36.992
I mean, we're gonna give it
all to the needy villagers.

11:37.140 --> 11:38.617
Minus 10% for pulling the job.

11:38.727 --> 11:40.047
What?

11:40.196 --> 11:41.656
We're not doing this for units.

11:41.744 --> 11:44.086
We're going this because somebody's
going to get a sled for Christmas

11:44.143 --> 11:45.766
if it's the last thing I do.

11:45.860 --> 11:47.582
This isn't about Altru, is it?

11:47.711 --> 11:48.985
DRAX: Then it is decided.

11:49.039 --> 11:50.461
I will pry the key to the vault

11:50.555 --> 11:53.227
from Neeza's cold,
lifeless hand. (GRUNTS)

11:53.327 --> 11:55.136
Huh? I am Groot.

11:55.977 --> 11:57.266
Good idea, bud.

11:57.369 --> 11:59.352
Me and Groot have learned
a valuable lesson

11:59.462 --> 12:01.321
from watching
that <i>Christmas Carol</i> story,

12:01.431 --> 12:03.758
namely how to use
a bunch of phony ghosts

12:03.795 --> 12:05.547
to fleece
a superstitious old miser

12:05.606 --> 12:07.239
out of his stash.

12:10.373 --> 12:12.173
(BEEPING)

12:16.146 --> 12:17.446
PETER: <i>We got an entry point.</i>

12:17.555 --> 12:20.422
So how do we get past
all the security cameras?

12:20.961 --> 12:23.191
"One foggy Christmas Eve."

12:25.117 --> 12:26.250
Oh, it's from a song.

12:26.322 --> 12:28.094
There's this red-nosed reindeer,

12:28.120 --> 12:29.229
and he... Never mind.

12:29.270 --> 12:31.125
DRAX: How can a deer
be made of rain?

12:31.231 --> 12:32.930
PETER: I said never mind.

12:48.133 --> 12:49.242
(GRUNTS)

12:54.610 --> 12:56.313
I came up with this whole idea.

12:56.383 --> 12:57.891
How come I gotta wear the dress?

12:58.006 --> 12:59.133
'Cause it fits you.

12:59.232 --> 13:00.508
Now, quit whining.

13:00.567 --> 13:01.666
(GRUMBLES)

13:02.525 --> 13:04.292
(SNORING)

13:05.122 --> 13:06.322
(DOOR OPENS)

13:20.488 --> 13:24.445
(IMITATING GHOST) Neeza! Harken!

13:24.481 --> 13:26.408
(GASPS) Who's there?

13:26.603 --> 13:28.932
We are evil spirits,

13:29.056 --> 13:32.619
come for the key to your vault.

13:32.775 --> 13:34.549
Begone, spirits.

13:34.799 --> 13:36.491
TheTalisman commands you.

13:36.526 --> 13:38.018
Talisman, shmalisman!

13:38.082 --> 13:39.682
That's how evil we are.

13:39.813 --> 13:41.299
Now, give me the key,

13:41.564 --> 13:44.393
or I will take you
on a ghostly voyage.

13:44.510 --> 13:46.501
You'll revisit every choice

13:46.658 --> 13:51.314
that turned you into the
universally despised scum you are.

13:51.463 --> 13:53.275
(SCOFFS) Is that all?

13:53.410 --> 13:54.853
When do we leave?

13:55.018 --> 13:56.119
Oh, yeah?

13:56.237 --> 13:59.346
Well, how about I give you
a little magical misery tour

13:59.494 --> 14:01.822
of all the suffering your
krutackin' little ransom scam

14:01.920 --> 14:05.022
is causing all over
the planet right now?

14:05.269 --> 14:09.127
(IN GHOST VOICE) I am Groot.

14:09.338 --> 14:12.228
And what is this cheap trinket?

14:12.393 --> 14:13.705
It's your future

14:13.808 --> 14:16.580
if you don't hand over the key.

14:16.773 --> 14:18.408
Eey-eey.

14:18.963 --> 14:20.306
What? (GASPING)

14:20.506 --> 14:21.853
I'll be...

14:22.113 --> 14:24.347
(STUTTERS) Poor?

14:24.463 --> 14:27.111
Poor as a Kallusian
shrine-rodent.

14:27.221 --> 14:29.344
(SCREAMS) All right! All right!

14:29.776 --> 14:30.875
(GASPS)

14:30.965 --> 14:32.899
Hmm. That's it.

14:33.035 --> 14:36.010
(POWERING UP)
Meet my spirit blaster.

14:37.720 --> 14:40.205
ROCKET: I'm starting to see why
you hate this holiday, Quill.

14:43.790 --> 14:46.463
Eat plasmacid, inferna

14:48.228 --> 14:51.064
Dude! Hey, remember us?
Not ghosts.

14:51.283 --> 14:52.994
(GASPS) You!

14:53.057 --> 14:54.994
You're worse than ghosts.

14:55.064 --> 14:56.885
You're thieves.

14:57.040 --> 14:59.040
(GRUNTING)

15:02.010 --> 15:03.745
Aah!

15:06.268 --> 15:08.497
ROCKET: Way to calm
him down, Quill.

15:10.010 --> 15:11.056
Really?

15:11.154 --> 15:12.787
The sock drawer?

15:18.862 --> 15:22.033
(GRUNTING)

15:22.190 --> 15:25.228
GAMORA: Let me guess. The old
man didn't scare so easily?

15:25.450 --> 15:27.383
Ha! In your face!

15:27.518 --> 15:30.088
You guys hit the vault. Me
and Gamora will get Altru.

15:35.611 --> 15:38.260
Oh, I knew you
wouldn't abandon me.

15:38.408 --> 15:40.572
Really? There's
something in you.

15:40.707 --> 15:43.377
I don't know what you call
it where you come from.

15:44.099 --> 15:45.533
Christmas spirit.

15:45.625 --> 15:47.697
I guess there was still
a drop or two left.

15:48.757 --> 15:49.799
ROCKET: Hurry up, Drax.

15:49.885 --> 15:51.885
This treasure
ain't gonna load itself.

15:51.975 --> 15:53.018

16:10.369 --> 16:11.846
Go. Gee, thanks, Quill.

16:11.932 --> 16:13.502
Huh, I wouldn't
have thought of that.

16:13.616 --> 16:14.815
Sheesh.

16:18.461 --> 16:19.893
Come on, you hunk of junk.

16:22.331 --> 16:23.877
Krutack! We're too heavy.

16:24.033 --> 16:25.465

No, no one gets left behind.

16:32.603 --> 16:33.837
Yes!

16:33.994 --> 16:36.330
(ALL GRUNT) Thank you, Santa!

16:36.666 --> 16:38.596
Hey, you finally got
your sled, Quill.

16:38.642 --> 16:40.822
Hmm? And I hope you know
how to drive it

16:40.932 --> 16:42.307
'cause we got company!

16:42.439 --> 16:43.744
(GRUNTING)

16:48.955 --> 16:53.205
And to all a good night!
Whoo-hoo!

16:54.080 --> 16:58.916

Fetch my possessions!

17:14.683 --> 17:16.550
Oh, that's how
you wanna play, huh?

17:16.585 --> 17:19.319
Hang on to your
pointy shoes, guys.

17:21.718 --> 17:23.457

17:23.492 --> 17:24.882
GROOT: I am Groot!

17:30.524 --> 17:32.132
We are badly outnumbered.

17:33.906 --> 17:36.163
I'd say that's the least
of our problems.

17:37.054 --> 17:39.444

pull that move!

17:46.749 --> 17:47.991
Quill?

17:48.100 --> 17:49.952
Uh, we could really use
some flying reindeer

17:49.995 --> 17:51.155
right about now.

17:53.826 --> 17:56.054
(GROOT GRUNTS) (PETER SCREAMS)

<i>or my precious</i>

18:19.114 --> 18:21.139

Or there's option number three.

18:27.723 --> 18:29.356
(YELPS)

18:36.186 --> 18:38.764
Huh. I'm actually starting
to like this snow stuff.

18:56.889 --> 18:59.093
Here, pull hard and try not
to hit any mountains.

18:59.155 --> 19:00.507
What are you gonna do?

19:00.577 --> 19:01.811
Just try to stop us all

19:01.889 --> 19:04.335
from whooshing into
an antimatter vortex.

19:06.679 --> 19:07.759
Either Rocket's been taking

19:07.786 --> 19:08.826
driving lessons from Drax,

19:08.854 --> 19:09.886
or they're in trouble.

I'm touched.

Oh, just
an antimatter generator.

Can you reprogram it?

19:35.669 --> 19:37.803
No way, but I can dislodge it.

19:37.877 --> 19:40.022
Dislodge?
Is that Rocket-speak for

19:40.100 --> 19:41.561
"blow the krutack out of"?

19:41.651 --> 19:42.950
- You mind?
