With all our money going
to the IVF fund

07:39.193 --> 07:41.896
or Shamiah's school, I don't
want him to feel left out.

there early and wait in line.

07:43.637 --> 07:44.818
Like how early?

07:44.918 --> 07:47.101
- Like now.

This is what
your rich collector friends do?

07:48.642 --> 07:50.264

No. Come on, Denise.

07:50.364 --> 07:51.985
- We have line guys.
- Of course.

07:52.085 --> 07:53.907

about Santiago?

08:04.177 --> 08:05.798
Okay.

08:05.898 --> 08:07.480
- Is everything all right?
- Yeah.

08:07.580 --> 08:10.122
Totally fine. Why?

08:10.222 --> 08:11.804
- Because it sounds like
you have some kind of problem

08:11.904 --> 08:12.925
with Santi.

08:13.025 --> 08:16.168
No, I...

08:16.268 --> 08:19.572

I do.

The problem is...

08:23.876 --> 08:25.177
he steals.

08:25.277 --> 08:26.898
- What?
- From our client.

08:26.998 --> 08:31.303
A lamp, a mid-century credenza,
a birdbath probably.

08:31.403 --> 08:32.984
- Marina, this is serious.
- Mm-hmm.

08:33.084 --> 08:33.985

anymore.

08:34.085 --> 08:34.986
What did you tell your clients?

08:35.086 --> 08:35.947
- Oh, I haven't--
I haven't told--

08:36.047 --> 08:37.108
I don't think I need--

08:37.208 --> 08:38.149

He doesn't steal.

08:41.572 --> 08:43.074
I just--I didn't wanna
tell you the truth

08:43.174 --> 08:46.797

about him.

08:46.897 --> 08:50.481
- Okay, well, what kind of a--
oh, my God.

08:50.581 --> 08:52.923

they don't mean anything.

08:53.023 --> 08:54.725
Dreams? Plural?

08:54.825 --> 08:56.327
I felt guilty hiding them

08:56.427 --> 08:58.208

that they do mean something.

Okay, come on.

09:55.723 --> 09:58.666

everyone probably for tips.

the O in Tom as a heart.

she said she liked my pants.

Oh, Tom, that's--

10:08.856 --> 10:10.177

to come see her band that night

for a drink after.
