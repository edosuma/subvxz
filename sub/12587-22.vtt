<b><font color="#0E7521">Ripped By mstoll</font></b>

00:33.575 --> 00:35.748
Thank God you're here, Bobby.

00:35.911 --> 00:38.790
Lori and me are gonna make out
in the janitor's closet.

00:38.789 --> 00:40.086
Will you be our lookout?

00:40.082 --> 00:41.709
No, I can't.

00:41.708 --> 00:45.303
Madame Pascal makes you explain
why you're tardy in French,

00:45.295 --> 00:47.798
but I can only say my name.

00:47.798 --> 00:49.516
Dude.

00:49.508 --> 00:51.431
Just hurry up.

01:02.604 --> 01:04.605
Why aren't you in class?

01:04.605 --> 01:06.779
Emily! Please don't bust me,
I was just...

01:06.775 --> 01:08.322
Out of my way, you two.

01:08.318 --> 01:11.788
I need some sawdust to clean up
some throw up from...

01:11.780 --> 01:13.202
a kid.

01:13.198 --> 01:14.791
Oh, don't go in there, sir.

01:14.783 --> 01:18.708
I'm developing pictures;
they're almost set.

01:19.788 --> 01:20.755
Whoa!

01:22.791 --> 01:25.214
I'm calling it in.

01:25.210 --> 01:28.339
I guess that's
what the law requires.

01:29.798 --> 01:31.345
Whatcha gonna do, huh?

01:31.341 --> 01:32.763
Huh?!

01:32.759 --> 01:34.682
I'll tell you what
I'm going to do!

01:34.845 --> 01:37.473
You're on my hard-hitting
exposÃ© series,

01:37.472 --> 01:38.689
<i>To Catch A Bully.</i>

01:38.849 --> 01:40.772
Consider yourself hit hard.

01:43.562 --> 01:45.235
He caught another one!

01:45.230 --> 01:47.608
My affection for Miguel
is expanding

01:47.608 --> 01:50.327
along with my definition
of "newsworthy."

01:50.319 --> 01:52.947
Ever since Miguel started
catching bullies,

01:52.946 --> 01:55.165
his approval ratings are
through the roof.

01:55.157 --> 01:58.127
I'm supposed to be Arlen's
"Anchor You Trust."

01:58.118 --> 02:00.041
Oh, Miguel is just pandering

02:00.037 --> 02:02.085
to the lowest common
denominator.

02:02.080 --> 02:05.129
You have to find out
who is below that

02:05.125 --> 02:07.127
and aim there.
You're right, sug.

02:07.127 --> 02:09.128
Let's go find a worthy cause

02:09.128 --> 02:11.803
to shamelessly exploit.

02:13.884 --> 02:16.933
You do not have permission
to record this conversation.

02:16.928 --> 02:17.975
Proceed.

02:17.971 --> 02:19.223
It's Carl Moss.

02:19.222 --> 02:20.599
I have Joseph in my office.

02:20.599 --> 02:22.567
I need a parent to come
down and pick him up.

02:22.559 --> 02:23.651
What happened?

02:23.644 --> 02:25.112
What's wrong with my baby boy?!

02:25.103 --> 02:27.356
I'm coming.
Protect him until I get there!

02:27.356 --> 02:28.949
;
Joseph!

02:28.940 --> 02:30.533
Keys!

02:30.525 --> 02:33.153
Joseph!

02:33.153 --> 02:35.155
<i>Principal Moss?</i>

02:35.155 --> 02:37.533
What is it? Who's in trouble--
You or Bobby?

02:37.532 --> 02:39.580
Oh, good, it's Bobby.

02:39.576 --> 02:41.544
All right, I'm on my way.

02:45.248 --> 02:47.296
Now, why don't you
tell your father

02:47.292 --> 02:49.761
what you and Lori were doing
in the janitor's closet?

02:49.753 --> 02:51.300
We weren't doing anything!

02:51.296 --> 02:52.513
And it wasn't even us!

02:52.506 --> 02:53.678
I'm not me!

02:53.674 --> 02:56.052
There's no way my Joseph
did this.

02:56.051 --> 02:57.098
He's too young.

02:57.094 --> 02:58.311
Smell his hair.

02:59.304 --> 03:01.352
It still has new baby smell.

03:01.348 --> 03:04.397
Son, you should only agree
to be someone's lookout

03:04.393 --> 03:06.395
during a time of war.

03:06.395 --> 03:09.774
Now, tell me why Joseph was
in the janitor's closet.

03:09.773 --> 03:13.243
He was just, um...

03:13.235 --> 03:16.239
selling drugs.

03:17.364 --> 03:19.787
That was an awful lie, son.

03:19.783 --> 03:21.785
Terrible.

03:21.785 --> 03:24.254
Can you believe
the nerve of Moss?

03:24.246 --> 03:25.372
Saying my innocent Joseph

03:25.372 --> 03:27.795
was doing something tawdry
with that girl.

03:27.791 --> 03:29.088
You know, Dale,

03:29.084 --> 03:32.088
maybe it's time you talked
to your boy about...

03:32.087 --> 03:34.306
uh, relations...

03:34.297 --> 03:37.426
you know, that are...
sexual in nature.

03:37.426 --> 03:40.475
I remember when I got
my "birds and bees" talk.

03:40.470 --> 03:42.723
Well, it was mostly
hand gestures.

03:42.723 --> 03:45.772
You-you still haven't
told me what...

03:45.767 --> 03:46.768
means, Hank.

03:46.768 --> 03:48.441
My boy isn't old enough
for that.

03:48.437 --> 03:50.781
He's still full of snips
and snails

03:50.772 --> 03:52.649
and puppy dog tails.

03:52.649 --> 03:55.402
He's six feet tall
and has a mustache.

03:55.402 --> 03:57.404
It's time.

03:57.404 --> 03:59.782
Okay, fine.

03:59.781 --> 04:02.159
I'll-I'll give him
the sex talk.

04:02.159 --> 04:03.752
Um, before I do that,

04:03.744 --> 04:06.714
I-I have some questions
myself.

04:09.082 --> 04:11.631
So, just like the daddy penguin

04:11.626 --> 04:13.799
protects the egg with his fur...

04:13.795 --> 04:15.217
Eh!

04:15.213 --> 04:17.055
You know, this is too childish
for you.

04:17.048 --> 04:18.391
Let's try this.

04:18.382 --> 04:21.762
When a daddy tiger really loves
a mommy tiger--

04:21.762 --> 04:23.230
Is this helpful?

04:23.221 --> 04:24.268
No.

04:24.264 --> 04:25.641
Are we done yet?

04:25.640 --> 04:26.766
I miss Lori.

04:26.767 --> 04:28.769
All I can think about
is her soft voice

04:28.769 --> 04:30.646
and her soft arm hairs.

04:30.645 --> 04:32.739
Nah, you're too young
for all of this!

04:32.898 --> 04:34.775
Can't you see this loose girl

04:34.775 --> 04:37.324
is forcing herself
onto your innocence?

04:37.319 --> 04:38.946
You can't say that about her!

04:38.945 --> 04:40.288
You don't even know her!

04:40.280 --> 04:41.953
And soon you won't either!

04:41.948 --> 04:43.791
I forbid you to see Lori!

04:43.784 --> 04:44.706
Ever again!

04:44.868 --> 04:46.620
That's so unfair!

04:46.620 --> 04:48.793
This is just like that movie
<i>Romeo and Juliet</i>

04:48.789 --> 04:51.793
when the Jets attack Romeo
with their break dancing

04:51.792 --> 04:53.920
to keep him
from the girl he loves!

04:53.919 --> 04:55.796
You don't love Lori.

04:55.796 --> 04:57.798
Love doesn't even exist.

04:57.798 --> 05:00.392
It's just a chemical created
in the labs of DuPont.

05:00.383 --> 05:01.760
It was an accident

05:01.760 --> 05:04.354
while they were developing those
spatulas that don't melt.

05:04.346 --> 05:05.598
You're just crazy.

05:05.597 --> 05:06.689
Stop talking.

05:06.848 --> 05:09.146
I hate you!

05:09.142 --> 05:12.442
You... you hate me?

05:25.116 --> 05:26.584
Maybe I can be the one

05:26.576 --> 05:29.045
who figures out what's
irritating all those bowels.

05:29.037 --> 05:30.630
That'll show Miguel.

05:30.622 --> 05:31.794
Joseph,

05:31.790 --> 05:34.168
let's forget all that stuff
we fought about.

05:34.167 --> 05:37.717
It's Thursday night, and
you know what that means.

05:37.712 --> 05:39.055
Cereal night.

05:39.047 --> 05:40.048
Wrong.

05:40.048 --> 05:42.221
Cereal night extreme!

05:42.217 --> 05:43.685
Sha, sha, sha.

05:43.677 --> 05:44.724
I bought all your

05:44.719 --> 05:45.766
favorite cereals

05:45.762 --> 05:48.106
to blend into one
mega-cereal:

05:48.098 --> 05:50.772
Brute Fiber, Cookie Holes,

05:50.767 --> 05:52.769
Baron Von Crunchberry.

05:52.769 --> 05:55.693
Maybe my cereal doesn't
want to be blended.

05:55.856 --> 05:57.779
Maybe it wants to be eaten
by itself

05:57.774 --> 05:59.742
and date whoever it wants!

06:04.781 --> 06:06.658
Oh, cheer up, sug.

06:06.658 --> 06:08.251
At his age, you can't
love your parents

06:08.243 --> 06:10.245
and your girlfriend
at the same time.

06:10.245 --> 06:12.247
It's confusing.

06:12.247 --> 06:13.794
Want me to get you some milk?

06:13.790 --> 06:14.791
No.

06:14.791 --> 06:17.795
I'll just have my cereal
with tears.

06:22.799 --> 06:24.767
Sorry I'm late.

06:24.759 --> 06:26.761
You know how when
your son hates you,

06:26.761 --> 06:29.765
you just want to shop
your blues away?

06:30.974 --> 06:33.397
At least Mega-Lo Mart
still loves me.

06:33.393 --> 06:35.771
They approved me
for a club card.

06:35.770 --> 06:37.272
Oh, my gosh, look!

06:37.272 --> 06:39.946
Dale, your real name
is on this card!

06:39.941 --> 06:41.784
B-- impossible.

06:41.776 --> 06:43.153
It's true.

06:43.153 --> 06:47.784
My God-given name has been
etched in plastic.

06:47.782 --> 06:49.784
Dale forgot

06:49.784 --> 06:51.286
he thinks club cards are a way

06:51.286 --> 06:54.039
for the government to identify
those who value a bargain!

06:54.039 --> 06:56.667
Yeah, man, talkin' 'bout a dang
ol' senior moment, man.

06:57.876 --> 06:59.594
Well, lighten up, Dale.

06:59.586 --> 07:01.759
You're just distracted
by Joseph.

07:01.755 --> 07:03.974
The other day I got
so worked up by Bobby,

07:03.965 --> 07:08.061
I let the gas get so low
that the warning light came on.

07:08.053 --> 07:09.771
I haven't used my real name

07:09.763 --> 07:12.232
since my library card
in middle school.

07:12.223 --> 07:14.396
And unless someone checks out
<i>Superfudge</i>,

07:14.392 --> 07:16.486
my secret is safe.

07:16.478 --> 07:19.402
I just don't know
how this happened.

07:21.608 --> 07:24.703
Yeah, he's chaperoning me
to and from school now.

07:24.861 --> 07:26.659
It's so embarrassing.

07:26.655 --> 07:28.248
Are you talking to Lori again

07:28.239 --> 07:30.082
after I told you not to?

07:30.075 --> 07:31.247
No!

07:31.242 --> 07:32.789
Sorry, Lori.
Go on.

07:32.786 --> 07:34.333
That's it!

07:34.329 --> 07:35.706
Phone privileges revoked!

07:35.872 --> 07:38.250
Hey, give it back!

07:42.796 --> 07:44.093
Oh, my God, uh,

07:44.089 --> 07:46.137
I can't remember the code.

07:48.134 --> 07:50.136
Hit the deck!

07:50.136 --> 07:53.766
Aah! Duck! Aah!

07:53.765 --> 07:56.314
My dad almost killed us.

07:56.309 --> 07:58.778
It's so embarrassing.

07:58.770 --> 08:00.772
I am going crazy.

08:00.772 --> 08:02.649
Or is that crazy talk?

08:02.649 --> 08:04.777
Either way, there's
a crazy element.

08:04.776 --> 08:06.699
I need help.

08:06.861 --> 08:10.741
Okay, my symptoms include:
forgetfulness,

08:10.907 --> 08:12.784
repeating things,

08:12.784 --> 08:14.786
being told I'm crazy--

08:14.786 --> 08:17.585
Oh, repeating things.

08:17.580 --> 08:19.457
Hello there!

08:19.457 --> 08:21.255
Before I can make my diagnosis,

08:21.251 --> 08:22.719
I'm going to need more
information.

08:22.877 --> 08:24.550
Please take our survey:

08:24.546 --> 08:25.798
"What's wrong with me?"

08:25.797 --> 08:28.892
Sponsored by Azteca
Pharmaceuticals.

08:28.883 --> 08:31.432
Are you paranoid?

08:31.428 --> 08:32.725
Who wants to know?

08:32.886 --> 08:35.390
Did you reply
"Who wants to know?"

08:35.390 --> 08:36.982
Yes.

08:40.562 --> 08:42.563
Great job!

08:42.563 --> 08:45.408
You've successfully completed
our survey.

08:45.400 --> 08:48.654
According to your answers,
you have dementia.

08:50.780 --> 08:52.782
Well, I finally figured out

08:52.782 --> 08:54.784
why I can't relate to Joseph.

08:54.784 --> 08:57.958
It's because... I have dementia.

08:57.954 --> 08:59.956
Oh, my!
I know.

08:59.956 --> 09:01.424
Who knows where I caught it

09:01.416 --> 09:02.793
or how long I've had it.

09:02.792 --> 09:05.170
I'm assuming that's
from the dementia.

09:05.170 --> 09:06.922
Don't be an idiot, Dale.

09:06.921 --> 09:08.923
You're just stressed out
about Joseph.

09:08.923 --> 09:11.767
You're not crazy...er
than usual.

09:11.760 --> 09:13.762
I almost killed my son.

09:13.762 --> 09:15.764
I'm not supposed to be the one
who kills him.

09:15.764 --> 09:17.766
The crushing weight
of the world is.

09:17.766 --> 09:19.768
I'm a danger to my family, Hank.

09:19.768 --> 09:22.362
And I know what I have to do
to keep them safe.

09:36.785 --> 09:38.958
You've been expecting me.

09:45.960 --> 09:47.712
Wow, nice duck.

09:47.879 --> 09:49.506
High five!

09:50.548 --> 09:52.676
What a realistic pencil holder.

09:52.675 --> 09:54.097
High five!

09:55.762 --> 09:59.767
Wow, that's
a really nice, um...

09:59.766 --> 10:01.768
When my son, Joseph, was a baby,

10:01.768 --> 10:04.772
his favorite meal
was Play-Doh spaghetti.

10:04.771 --> 10:06.773
He ate it with bugs.

10:06.773 --> 10:09.947
He called it "spissghetti
and meat-bugs."

10:09.943 --> 10:10.990
Well, great!

10:10.985 --> 10:12.862
High five!

10:17.784 --> 10:20.253
Dale! I hate seeing
you like this!

10:20.245 --> 10:23.465
I always considered you
my brother, Dale.

10:23.456 --> 10:26.551
And I always considered you
my neighbor, Bill.

10:29.796 --> 10:31.423
All right, Dale,
enough is enough.

10:31.422 --> 10:33.550
Get your things.
We're going home.

10:33.550 --> 10:35.427
I'm not going anywhere, Hank.

10:35.426 --> 10:37.599
This is where I belong now.

10:37.595 --> 10:39.643
Please, remember me as a person

10:39.639 --> 10:42.643
who once remembered things.

10:42.642 --> 10:44.565
Ugh, dang it, this is crazy.

10:44.561 --> 10:46.404
I've got to do something
about this.

10:46.396 --> 10:48.398
Excuse me, who's in charge here?

10:49.732 --> 10:50.733
I am!

10:58.199 --> 10:59.792
Are you the doctor here?

10:59.784 --> 11:00.785
I'm not a doctor.

11:00.785 --> 11:02.207
I'm Mike Patel.

11:02.203 --> 11:04.752
I own this particular franchise
of Comforting Pines.

11:04.914 --> 11:06.131
Franchise?

11:06.124 --> 11:08.126
Ugh, look, my friend, Dale--

11:08.126 --> 11:09.799
Uh, wait, is that

11:09.794 --> 11:11.796
a certificate from Whataburger?

11:11.796 --> 11:12.797
Oh, yeah.

11:12.797 --> 11:14.219
I used to own one of those.

11:14.215 --> 11:15.467
Swapped it for this place.

11:15.466 --> 11:17.389
The flame-broiling fad is over.

11:17.385 --> 11:20.184
Are you qualified to run
this kind of facility?

11:20.180 --> 11:22.148
Are you asking
if I'm qualified to care?

11:22.140 --> 11:24.142
Because the answer is yes!

11:24.142 --> 11:27.146
Thankfully, the government
doesn't regulate "care."

11:27.145 --> 11:29.113
Well, either way,
what do I need to do

11:29.105 --> 11:30.982
to get my friend checked
out of here?

11:30.982 --> 11:33.952
Sorry, but, uh, only Mr. Gribble
can check himself out.

11:33.943 --> 11:37.322
And from the looks of his art
project, he seems pretty happy.

11:37.322 --> 11:39.370
Hey, you know, we're running
a special promotion,

11:39.365 --> 11:42.414
if you want me to hang on
to the big guy for you.

11:47.916 --> 11:49.714
Hey,Joseph, come on.

11:49.709 --> 11:53.054
The marching band left
some tubas unattended.

11:53.046 --> 11:54.047
I can't.

11:54.047 --> 11:56.141
Lori wants to make out
in the gym.

11:56.132 --> 11:58.260
She likes it
when our kisses echo.

11:59.344 --> 12:00.971
That seems right up your alley.

12:00.970 --> 12:02.062
What's wrong?

12:02.055 --> 12:04.023
It's all happening so fast.

12:04.015 --> 12:06.017
Lori says she wants
to go further.

12:06.017 --> 12:07.769
What's "further"?

12:07.769 --> 12:08.770
I dunno.

12:08.770 --> 12:11.273
Maybe she wants to go
to McMaynerbury?

12:11.272 --> 12:13.616
Ugh, I'm so confused.

12:14.651 --> 12:16.995
Dude, relationships are hard!

12:18.947 --> 12:21.996
Bye,dude.

12:21.991 --> 12:23.959
And that will be later
tonight on...

12:23.952 --> 12:25.454
<i>To Catch A Bully.</i>

12:25.453 --> 12:29.378
This whole Dale
situation is just asinine.

12:29.374 --> 12:31.342
So he hit a rough
patch with Joseph.

12:31.334 --> 12:32.802
It's no reason to check yourself

12:32.794 --> 12:34.546
into a mental institution.

12:34.545 --> 12:35.797
Poor Nancy.

12:35.797 --> 12:37.765
First Miguel and now this.

12:37.757 --> 12:38.804
And Sunday,

12:38.800 --> 12:40.393
I'll be visiting
the pregnant gorilla

12:40.385 --> 12:41.978
at the Arlen Zoo.

12:41.970 --> 12:43.187
How about you, Nancy?

12:43.179 --> 12:45.648
Any, uh, plans this...
Glad you asked, Miguel.

12:45.640 --> 12:48.564
Four million Americans suffer
from dementia,

12:48.559 --> 12:51.984
and I personally know
number four million and one.

12:51.980 --> 12:53.982
My husband.

12:53.982 --> 12:58.362
I'm going to spend my weekend
raising "dementia awareness."

12:58.361 --> 13:00.705
Kind of puts Miguel's
dog and pony show

13:00.697 --> 13:03.075
in perspective, doesn't it?

13:04.450 --> 13:05.702
Attagirl, Nancy!

13:05.868 --> 13:07.711
Raise that awareness
over Miguel's head

13:07.870 --> 13:09.747
and smack him with it!

13:13.668 --> 13:15.170
I wish Dale was here.

13:15.169 --> 13:17.922
I miss the two little me's
reflected in his sunglasses

13:17.922 --> 13:19.720
when he scowls at me.

13:19.716 --> 13:22.094
Hey, man, I ain't dang missin'
him one dang ol' bit, man.

13:22.093 --> 13:23.720
How talkin' 'bout
makin' no claims

13:23.720 --> 13:24.721
without no citations, man.

13:24.887 --> 13:27.390
Gettin' on my last nerve, boy.

13:27.390 --> 13:30.189
Well, I know we have to talk
some sense into Dale,

13:30.184 --> 13:32.733
but maybe we don't have to
do it today.

13:32.729 --> 13:35.482
It's nice to not have to face
magnetic north.

13:40.320 --> 13:42.743
True north.

13:44.657 --> 13:46.079
Hey, someone's breaking

13:46.075 --> 13:47.952
into Dale's van!

13:49.037 --> 13:50.414
Ugh!

13:50.413 --> 13:51.790
Ugh. stop that!

13:51.789 --> 13:52.790
Take a knee!

13:52.790 --> 13:55.009
You go home, young lady.

13:57.086 --> 13:59.509
I don't know what you think
you were doing in there,

13:59.505 --> 14:00.722
but just cool it.

14:00.715 --> 14:02.183
Go play a video game

14:02.175 --> 14:04.769
or step on some ants
or something.

14:04.761 --> 14:07.105
Actually, can I talk
to you for a second?

14:07.096 --> 14:09.770
I can't talk to my dad,
'cause he's gone,

14:09.766 --> 14:12.565
and I can't talk to my mom,
'cause she's gone.

14:12.560 --> 14:13.777
What is it, Joseph?

14:13.770 --> 14:16.364
I think Lori wants
to go all the way.

14:16.356 --> 14:17.448
All the way where--

14:17.440 --> 14:19.158
Oh, Lord.

14:19.150 --> 14:20.948
I'm feeling a lot of pressure
from her,

14:20.943 --> 14:23.287
and I don't know what to do.

14:23.279 --> 14:25.281
Mr. Hill?

14:30.912 --> 14:33.290
Dale, you gotta
get yourself out of here!

14:33.289 --> 14:34.791
Joseph and Lori are thinking

14:34.791 --> 14:36.793
about "going all the way."

14:36.793 --> 14:37.760
He's running wild.

14:37.919 --> 14:39.512
He needs his father.

14:39.504 --> 14:41.097
"All the way?!"

14:41.089 --> 14:42.887
That's only for married people.

14:42.882 --> 14:44.429
And only for a while.

14:44.425 --> 14:47.304
I have to have the sex talk with
him before he makes a mistake!

14:47.303 --> 14:48.680
Hang on, Joseph!

14:48.679 --> 14:50.181
Daddy's coming!

14:50.181 --> 14:52.183
Hello there,
Mr. Gribble.

14:52.183 --> 14:53.275
We're having a
high-functioning!

14:53.267 --> 14:54.735
Low-functioning mixer
in the rec room.

14:54.894 --> 14:56.737
No, thanks, Patel.
I'm leaving.

14:56.896 --> 14:58.773
Oh, you can't just leave.
No, no, no.

14:58.773 --> 15:00.775
There's protocol and waivers
and releases.

15:00.775 --> 15:03.574
There's paperwork to keep
us busy for days!

15:03.569 --> 15:04.786
No time for that.

15:04.779 --> 15:07.749
My boy is about to become a man
and he must be stopped!

15:07.907 --> 15:09.750
You can't leave

15:09.909 --> 15:11.752
until we establish if you're
a threat to others.

15:11.911 --> 15:13.754
I'm only a threat to you!

15:15.248 --> 15:17.342
Security breach!
We got a runner!

15:17.333 --> 15:19.427
What?!

15:19.419 --> 15:21.342
Hmm? Come on!

15:22.380 --> 15:23.802
Get back here!

15:23.798 --> 15:24.924
Gribble!

15:24.924 --> 15:26.471
Hey!

15:26.467 --> 15:27.969
Cold blanket!

15:29.971 --> 15:31.348
No, there's a misunderstanding!

15:31.347 --> 15:32.394
Stop!

15:35.768 --> 15:37.736
So cold.

15:43.568 --> 15:45.161
I can't believe
this is happening.

15:45.153 --> 15:47.781
I never had to cold-blanket
someone before.

15:47.780 --> 15:50.078
This is not like
the burger business at all.

15:50.074 --> 15:53.078
Dang it, Mr. Patel,
just let Dale go.

15:53.077 --> 15:55.455
You can't hold him here
against his will.

15:55.455 --> 15:57.799
Unfortunately,
that's what I have to do.

15:57.790 --> 16:00.464
He assaulted
a franchise employee.

16:00.460 --> 16:04.055
Comforting Pines procedure
dictates I hold him until...

16:04.046 --> 16:06.424
he's no longer
"at risk."

16:06.424 --> 16:08.222
There's gotta be something
you can do.

16:08.217 --> 16:09.639
His son needs him.

16:09.635 --> 16:11.683
Eh, you're welcome to look
through the manual.

16:11.679 --> 16:14.182
But if it's not in there,
I can't do it.

16:18.352 --> 16:21.151
You'd think
something so complicated

16:21.147 --> 16:23.366
would be a little more
pleasurable to read.

16:23.357 --> 16:24.358
Wait.

16:24.358 --> 16:25.780
I think I found something.

16:25.776 --> 16:28.780
Okay, apparently,
if Dale acts crazier,

16:28.779 --> 16:31.749
Comforting Pines
is required by law

16:31.741 --> 16:34.745
to turn him over
to a state mental hospital

16:34.744 --> 16:37.793
for an "emergency
psychiatric evaluation."

16:37.788 --> 16:41.292
Peggy, we are trying to get
Dale out, not further in.

16:41.292 --> 16:42.794
It will work, Hank.

16:42.793 --> 16:45.592
Once Dale is admitted, the state
hospital will test him,

16:45.588 --> 16:48.637
realize he's not crazy
and let him go.

16:48.633 --> 16:50.727
I don't knows, Peggy.

16:50.718 --> 16:52.766
Hank, either you have
Dale evaluated

16:52.762 --> 16:55.265
by the same government
that runs the post office

16:55.264 --> 16:58.518
or by a guy
who used to sell cheeseburgers.

16:58.518 --> 16:59.519
Huh.

16:59.519 --> 17:01.567
The post office.

17:01.562 --> 17:04.156
All right, I'll go tell Dale.

17:04.147 --> 17:07.152
Uh, as soon as Nancy comes home.

17:07.151 --> 17:09.369
You don't know what love is!

17:09.362 --> 17:11.955
Joseph, I assure you we do.

17:11.948 --> 17:14.791
After all, we made that.

17:14.784 --> 17:16.707
Oh, come on!

17:18.037 --> 17:19.084
So that's it?

17:19.079 --> 17:20.332
I act batty,

17:20.330 --> 17:22.333
they send me
to the battier house,

17:22.333 --> 17:23.800
then they let me go?

17:23.792 --> 17:25.136
Yep, pretty much.

17:25.127 --> 17:26.503
Think you can handle it?

17:26.503 --> 17:28.472
Anything for my Joseph.

17:32.468 --> 17:33.811
I got this.

18:08.170 --> 18:10.764
This better work,
'cause I can't stay here.

18:10.756 --> 18:12.758
This place is seriously nuts.

18:12.758 --> 18:14.556
One of the patients likes me

18:14.552 --> 18:17.055
and wants to carve
our initials in my head.

18:17.054 --> 18:19.432
Calm down, Dale,
we're almost there.

18:19.432 --> 18:21.526
They're just gonna ask you
some easy questions.

18:21.517 --> 18:23.565
All you have to do
is act normal.

18:23.561 --> 18:25.154
Anything for my son.

18:25.146 --> 18:26.238
Look at him--

18:26.230 --> 18:28.232
He needs me!

18:28.232 --> 18:29.575
All right, let's begin.

18:29.567 --> 18:31.114
Please state your name.

18:31.110 --> 18:32.737
Dale Gribble.

18:32.903 --> 18:34.701
On Earth.

18:34.697 --> 18:36.950
On Pleiades,
it's unpronounceable.

18:40.036 --> 18:41.788
Uh, Mr. Gribble,

18:41.787 --> 18:43.755
do you believe people
conspire against you?

18:43.914 --> 18:45.791
People. Animals.

18:45.791 --> 18:46.758
Insects.

18:46.917 --> 18:48.760
'Specially the insects.

18:48.919 --> 18:50.296
You don't even want to know

18:50.296 --> 18:53.300
what the bark beetle
has to say about me.

18:53.299 --> 18:55.097
And everyone knows

18:55.092 --> 18:57.766
what George Washington Carver
did with peanuts,

18:57.762 --> 19:00.641
but nobody knows what he did
to peanuts--

19:00.640 --> 19:02.688
He weaponized them.

19:03.768 --> 19:05.770
Uh, thank you,
Mr. Gribble.

19:05.770 --> 19:07.363
Okay, I think
we've heard enough.

19:07.355 --> 19:08.982
Recommendation is
for commitment.

19:08.981 --> 19:10.073
Commitment?!

19:10.066 --> 19:11.318
No!

19:13.861 --> 19:15.659
Joseph, listen to me.

19:15.655 --> 19:19.455
This may be my last opportunity
to tell you this.

19:19.450 --> 19:22.249
I know you know a thing
or two about sex.

19:22.244 --> 19:23.666
You're old enough,

19:23.663 --> 19:26.041
and you often forget to delete
your Internet history.

19:26.040 --> 19:28.259
But you just know
the physical stuff.

19:28.250 --> 19:30.252
Sex is also mental.

19:30.252 --> 19:32.801
And you're too young
to handle those emotions.

19:32.797 --> 19:34.765
That's why I think
you should wait.

19:38.135 --> 19:41.685
My dad is not crazy.

19:43.766 --> 19:45.393
Uh, yeah, he is.

19:45.393 --> 19:46.861
According to the State of Texas.

19:48.938 --> 19:52.488
Please, son, save
your precious flower!

19:59.115 --> 20:02.289
Lori, I don't want to go
all the way with you.

20:02.284 --> 20:04.286
What?! That's so lame!

20:04.286 --> 20:06.709
Don't you want to be... cool?

20:06.706 --> 20:07.798
Sorry, Lori.

20:07.790 --> 20:09.713
No means no.

20:11.502 --> 20:13.880
What about going halfway?

20:18.759 --> 20:21.638
This thing with Miguel--
It's like an arms race.

20:21.637 --> 20:22.763
He went after bullies,

20:22.763 --> 20:24.515
I countered
with dementia awareness,

20:24.515 --> 20:25.732
then he started
some organization

20:25.891 --> 20:28.735
called the "Society for
Children With No Bones."

20:28.894 --> 20:31.067
I mean, I don't even think
that's a real thing.

20:32.773 --> 20:36.277
Hey, that doctor probably knows
about some great new diseases.

20:36.277 --> 20:39.247
Gotta get in
on the ground floor, sug.

20:43.784 --> 20:45.786
Joseph, you did the right thing.

20:45.786 --> 20:47.459
I'm so proud of you.

20:47.455 --> 20:48.502
Yeah.

20:48.497 --> 20:50.295
Lori broke up with me, though.

20:50.291 --> 20:51.759
It hurts so much.

20:51.917 --> 20:54.716
It's like my heart
is a really sad man.

20:54.712 --> 20:56.714
Breakups never get easy.

20:56.714 --> 20:57.806
You know, we should get rid

20:57.798 --> 21:00.267
of those photos
of Lori on your phone.

21:00.259 --> 21:02.261
Tell you what--
When I get home,

21:02.261 --> 21:04.184
I'll help you smash it
to pieces.

21:06.390 --> 21:08.563
I hope you get out soon.

21:08.559 --> 21:09.606
I will.

21:09.602 --> 21:10.694
Due to budget cuts,

21:10.686 --> 21:13.565
