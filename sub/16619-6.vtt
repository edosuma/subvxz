00:01.234 --> 00:02.726
Previously on "Quantico"...

00:02.751 --> 00:04.709
- You know that woman?
- Dayana Mampasi.

00:04.734 --> 00:07.664
I know some of the others,
too. Harry Doyle, Lydia Bates,

00:07.749 --> 00:09.593
León Velez, and Sebastian Chen.

00:09.618 --> 00:10.945
We trained together at The Farm.

00:10.970 --> 00:12.867
- There's a new recruit?
- Leigh Davis.

00:12.892 --> 00:15.248
- She's a wedding planner.
- I'm with MI6.

00:15.282 --> 00:17.179
Now look, I swear to God
you better come clean.

00:17.204 --> 00:20.587
I saw you at the club. You
enjoyed being so close to danger.

00:20.621 --> 00:22.789
- Didn't think you were coming.
- Oh, I wasn't.

00:22.823 --> 00:24.167
You tried to kill yourself, didn't you?

00:24.192 --> 00:27.114
Someone close to me
struggled with the same thing.

00:27.130 --> 00:28.964
Only he actually did go through with it

00:28.999 --> 00:31.066
- What do you want?
- I want those names.

00:31.101 --> 00:32.934
Your weakness... doubt.

00:33.575 --> 00:35.683
- Alex?
- How the hell did you get out?

00:37.397 --> 00:38.886

00:48.852 --> 00:51.153
What happened? We heard gunfire.

00:51.187 --> 00:55.391
They traded the Federal Hall
hostages for one man... Eric Boyer.

00:55.425 --> 00:57.660
Why so many people for Eric Boyer?

00:57.694 --> 00:59.061
They didn't say.

00:59.095 --> 01:01.470
All I did was translate their demands.

01:01.564 --> 01:03.899
Oh, so you helped them,
then. Well, that's brilliant.

01:03.934 --> 01:05.567
No, no. I tried.

01:05.602 --> 01:07.861
I wanted to help the hostages.

01:08.171 --> 01:10.102
Was Ryan part of that group?

01:10.127 --> 01:12.174
I haven't seen Ryan for hours.

01:12.208 --> 01:13.658
Who fired the first shot?

01:13.970 --> 01:16.758
- One of the terrorists.
- Then why haven't they released us?

01:16.783 --> 01:19.581
Please, lower your voices.
They're standing outside that door.

01:19.616 --> 01:21.684
Some of us in here must matter to them.

01:21.992 --> 01:24.393
I don't hear them. Think they left?

01:24.418 --> 01:27.523
Of course not. They must
be planning something.

01:27.557 --> 01:29.925
- We need to get the upper hand.
- How?

01:29.960 --> 01:32.161
Figure out why they're keeping us.

01:32.195 --> 01:35.464
As León said, we're here
for a reason, but what?

01:35.738 --> 01:37.439
How are we all connected?

01:37.473 --> 01:39.007
They could be listening to us right now.

01:39.042 --> 01:41.097
We know they pose among us.

01:41.311 --> 01:44.536
So, maybe as we speak,
we'll expose them.

01:45.148 --> 01:47.249
- Why should we trust you?
- Because Alex and Ryan do.

01:47.283 --> 01:49.017
It's a risk we have to take.

01:49.052 --> 01:51.954
I'm Harry Doyle. I'm
MI6, Officer Rank 4.

01:51.988 --> 01:55.357
I was part of a pilot program between
the CIA and my government last year,

01:55.391 --> 01:57.192
but I was attached as
a British delegation

01:57.227 --> 01:59.962
to the G20 as a security
asset from my country.

02:00.337 --> 02:01.806
Next.

02:02.056 --> 02:04.533
Dayana Mampasi. I'm
a lawyer for the HRF,

02:04.567 --> 02:08.570
and I do contract work for the
government from time to time.

02:08.604 --> 02:10.271
- So does he.
- Dayana.

02:10.306 --> 02:13.408
Is there anyone here
who's not with the CIA?

02:13.443 --> 02:15.043
I'm a journalist for CNN.

02:15.078 --> 02:16.778
I'm an ambassador for UNICEF.

02:17.075 --> 02:19.448
- I'm an event planner.
- I'm an interpreter.

02:19.482 --> 02:21.817
That's one theory
down. Let's keep going.

02:21.851 --> 02:24.820
León Velez. I'm a
photographer covering the G20

02:24.854 --> 02:26.755
because the President of the
World Bank was gonna speak.

02:27.078 --> 02:28.679
Who's next?

02:33.496 --> 02:35.007
Simon.

02:36.032 --> 02:38.642
- We're all still here.
- I'm always with you.

02:54.063 --> 02:56.952
Shelby and I spoke with
Miranda about Harry Doyle.

02:56.977 --> 03:00.179
He is MI6, and the CIA
does know about him.

03:00.223 --> 03:01.623
Yeah, but I still don't trust him.

03:01.658 --> 03:05.022
Just because we know his secret
doesn't mean we should share ours.

03:05.047 --> 03:06.750
He practically held us at
gunpoint that first night.

03:06.786 --> 03:08.678
He wouldn't let us leave the
room until we told him everything.

03:08.703 --> 03:10.832
Okay, we told him nothing,
and he let us leave.

03:10.867 --> 03:12.790
Yes, but every day we don't fess up

03:12.815 --> 03:15.680
is one day closer to him
telling the agency or Owen Hall.

03:15.705 --> 03:17.773
We told him that Miranda
was out of town on business.

03:17.807 --> 03:19.174
He gave us till the end of the week.

03:19.208 --> 03:20.342
Which is today.

03:21.844 --> 03:23.396
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

03:23.813 --> 03:26.216
You're five weeks into this mission,

03:26.241 --> 03:29.184
almost a third of the way through
The Farm, and totally behind.

03:29.218 --> 03:32.076
If Owen Hall is recruiting AIC,
he should have done it by now.

03:32.101 --> 03:33.221
What about Leigh?

03:33.256 --> 03:35.657
Just because she didn't plant that
bug does not mean she's in the clear.

03:35.692 --> 03:39.227
She's too busy Internet parenting
to be plotting against America.

03:39.262 --> 03:43.565
- Scottie keeps pushing me.
- Yeah, well, Scottie's an idiot.

03:43.599 --> 03:45.467
Ignore him, sweet pea.

03:45.509 --> 03:46.987
Can you do that for me?

03:47.012 --> 03:48.557
I just wish you were here.

03:48.582 --> 03:49.791
And Dayana?

03:49.909 --> 03:52.407
I feel she's completely
fallen off your radar.

03:52.442 --> 03:53.975
'Cause she hasn't done
anything this week,

03:54.010 --> 03:57.994
I mean, besides train, sleep, and
try and make it through a little life.

03:58.168 --> 04:00.302
If she's hiding something,
she's really good at it.

04:00.327 --> 04:03.819
If recruits are training
together in private for the AIC,

04:03.853 --> 04:06.213
they could forge new bonds.

04:06.238 --> 04:07.989
Notice anyone getting cliquish?

04:08.024 --> 04:10.330
Harry and Sebastian.

04:10.355 --> 04:13.495
All right, stop, stop, stop, stop.
You're not planting this right foot.

04:13.529 --> 04:15.063
This foot here, you got to plant it.

04:15.090 --> 04:17.329
Look, you're really good at this,
but you just plant that foot,

04:17.363 --> 04:20.189
because a proper punch, it
starts from your legs, yeah?

04:20.213 --> 04:21.985
- Yeah.
- Since we can't talk to Harry,

04:22.010 --> 04:23.372
maybe we try Sebastian.

04:23.406 --> 04:24.573
They are getting closer.

04:24.607 --> 04:26.608
Is anyone keeping a weird schedule?

04:26.642 --> 04:29.997
- Sneaking off, doing their own thing?
- You mean like us?

04:30.613 --> 04:33.293
León hasn't slept at the
house the last few nights.

04:39.722 --> 04:41.623
Hey, hey, hey, hey, where
do you think you're going?

04:41.657 --> 04:43.725
I should've left hours ago.

04:43.760 --> 04:45.594
You always leave.

04:45.628 --> 04:50.199
Okay, so text me later when you're
free, and maybe I'll come back.

04:55.519 --> 04:58.714
So, we have a lot of suspects
doing a whole lot of nothing.

04:58.739 --> 05:00.542
We also have someone riding our ass

05:00.576 --> 05:02.308
that could blow our entire
op any time he wants,

05:02.333 --> 05:05.213
- so what are we doing about that?
- What are you doing about that?

05:05.495 --> 05:08.483
- You're the handlers. Handle it.
- You need to give him something.

05:08.518 --> 05:10.619
If not the truth, a good cover story.

05:10.653 --> 05:12.979
- He'll know it was a lie.
- Not if it is convincing.

05:13.004 --> 05:14.462
Make it personal.

05:14.494 --> 05:17.549
A cover that plays on a mark's
emotions makes them buy it more easily,

05:17.574 --> 05:21.329
like when you used your daddy issues
in your cover for Alex at Quantico.

05:21.364 --> 05:22.731
Thanks for the memory.

05:22.765 --> 05:26.268
Just find something
about his life and use it.

05:26.302 --> 05:28.770
Get James Blonde off your
back once and for all,

05:28.805 --> 05:30.472
or you're done at The Farm.

05:34.844 --> 05:36.586
Ah.

05:37.780 --> 05:39.281
You want something.

05:39.315 --> 05:41.082
Eggs in a basket is what you made

05:41.117 --> 05:42.918
every time you were leaving town.

05:42.952 --> 05:44.085
Mm.

05:44.120 --> 05:46.988
Guess you thought it would take
the sting out of seeing you go.

05:47.023 --> 05:51.724
Well, thanks to you, I have the list
of sources from the story that named me.

05:51.795 --> 05:55.030
And wouldn't you know it,
half of them don't exist.

05:55.064 --> 05:57.849
You think they're
aliases from the company.

05:58.067 --> 06:01.703
And you want me to use my
security clearance to find out.

06:01.737 --> 06:05.231
I wasn't burned. I was
taken out by our people.

06:05.708 --> 06:07.776
That could be proof.

06:14.730 --> 06:17.819
Next time you want something, ask.

06:20.223 --> 06:21.957
Instead of trying to bribe me.

06:21.991 --> 06:25.588
It didn't work then,
it doesn't work now.

06:25.728 --> 06:28.572
Actually, I think it kind of did.

06:31.067 --> 06:33.668
Alex, this is the third
time I've asked you.

06:33.703 --> 06:36.805
You were supposed to come to the
media office and submit your statement.

06:37.083 --> 06:40.609
The press might ask where you are,
and we need something to tell them.

06:40.681 --> 06:42.984
I'm sorry. I just haven't
gotten around to it.

06:43.009 --> 06:46.047
- Um, I'll do it right after class.
- See that you do.

06:49.322 --> 06:51.753
Look, I know it sucks, but you
really should get that done.

06:51.787 --> 06:53.421
I will.

06:53.456 --> 06:56.314
All right. Listen up.

06:56.556 --> 06:59.867
Everything we've taught you thus
far has been about your survival.

06:59.892 --> 07:02.564
While protecting your
own life is paramount,

07:02.598 --> 07:06.126
as an operative in the field, you might
one day have to end someone else's.

07:06.151 --> 07:09.838
This is the MQ-9A Reaper drone,
and it is the deadliest weapon

07:09.872 --> 07:12.555
in our unmanned aerial weapons arsenal.

07:12.580 --> 07:14.741
Deadly force requires deliberation.

07:14.766 --> 07:17.178
Sometimes you make the right
decision. Other times, you don't.

07:17.213 --> 07:20.348
Either way, you have to live
with it and its consequences.

07:20.383 --> 07:22.617
The question is, can you?

07:22.652 --> 07:25.687
It's not always our actions, but
their aftermath that haunt us.

07:25.721 --> 07:27.722
So today we're gonna
find out who among you

07:27.757 --> 07:30.058
is strong enough to face themselves.

07:33.796 --> 07:36.364
_

07:40.570 --> 07:42.737
Where did you get that sat phone, Alex?

07:42.772 --> 07:44.039
Until you answer my questions,

07:44.073 --> 07:45.874
I'm not answering any of yours.

07:45.908 --> 07:48.944
Trust has always been a foreign
concept to you, hasn't it, Alex?

07:48.978 --> 07:50.712
Like truth with you.

07:50.746 --> 07:52.085
Right.

07:52.510 --> 07:54.644
How'd you get out of where
they were holding you?

07:54.669 --> 07:57.152
I escaped after the hostage exchange.

07:57.186 --> 07:58.954
Then why are you still
here and not miles away?

07:58.988 --> 08:01.830
And risk setting off
their biological weapon?

08:02.111 --> 08:05.801
I also happen to like my head.
I'd like to keep it on my body.

08:05.828 --> 08:09.135
The only way I'm getting out of here
is by putting an end to the crisis,

08:09.160 --> 08:11.900
and believe it or not, that
sat phone you have is how.

08:11.934 --> 08:15.179
It contains the 25-character
code to a safe in Federal Hall.

08:15.204 --> 08:17.772
In that safe are all
the encrypted hard drives

08:17.807 --> 08:21.390
each member state of the summit
brought to New York as a show of faith.

08:21.811 --> 08:24.562
So, you're telling me
the hostages, this attack,

08:24.587 --> 08:27.816
the bio weapons, the First
Lady is all for computer drives?

08:27.850 --> 08:30.819
Those drives contain
decades worth of intelligence

08:30.853 --> 08:33.955
gathered through surveillance systems
the leaders were here to dismantle.

08:33.990 --> 08:37.065
Classified intercepts,
clandestine operations,

08:37.200 --> 08:39.337
millions of e-mails, text messages.

08:39.363 --> 08:41.370
You want to get to them
before the terrorists do.

08:41.682 --> 08:43.739
The terrorists already have them.

08:44.133 --> 08:47.769
They're useless without someone
capable of decrypting them.

08:47.803 --> 08:49.804
Someone like Eric Boyer?

08:49.839 --> 08:51.347
We have to destroy the drives

08:51.372 --> 08:53.745
before the terrorists figure
out how to decrypt them.

08:53.878 --> 08:55.866
How do I know you're not
leading me into a trap?

08:55.891 --> 08:57.292
You don't.

09:00.483 --> 09:01.883
They're in this building.

09:01.917 --> 09:04.542
I heard the First Lady talk about it.

09:07.657 --> 09:09.758
She escaped. I was taking her back.

09:09.816 --> 09:10.816
_

09:13.339 --> 09:14.339
_

09:14.854 --> 09:16.275
_

09:16.886 --> 09:20.550
_

09:30.031 --> 09:31.699
Trust me now?

09:36.719 --> 09:38.353
Okay.

09:38.387 --> 09:40.121
Lead the way.

09:43.959 --> 09:48.028
<font color="#007700">Synced and corrected by Aaronnmb</font>
www.addic7ed.com

09:50.633 --> 09:53.289
This isn't working. There's
nothing that connects us...

09:53.314 --> 09:55.799
- except the fact that we're all here.
- We need to look deeper.

09:55.834 --> 09:58.225
Maybe it's not why we're
here but where we've been.

09:58.250 --> 10:01.163
I mean, do we unknowingly know
these terrorists from our past?

10:01.188 --> 10:02.488
Where has everyone
been in the last year?

10:02.523 --> 10:03.823
- Since The Farm?
- Yeah.

10:03.857 --> 10:05.958
On the road the past six months.

10:05.993 --> 10:08.828
Managua, Mexico City, Havana, Singapore.

10:08.862 --> 10:11.164
- Freelance photography work.
- Oh, really?

10:11.189 --> 10:14.867
No employer outside of the media has
taken you to those exciting places?

10:14.902 --> 10:18.371
I've been landlocked. In-house counsel
for the Human Rights Foundation.

10:18.405 --> 10:21.007
I haven't seen the
outside of a courtroom

10:21.041 --> 10:24.877
except for two weeks vacation
I took in Bali after The Farm.

10:24.912 --> 10:26.846
Okay, not that I see why it matters,

10:26.880 --> 10:28.714
but I've been all over
the place the last year.

10:28.749 --> 10:30.483
Planning the U.S. Ambassador's
wedding in Hong Kong.

10:30.517 --> 10:32.652
I was in Maui with Reese and her family.

10:32.686 --> 10:35.488
Jakarta for the Lunar New
Year. Want me to keep going?

10:35.522 --> 10:36.999
I mean, I'm a human passport.

10:37.024 --> 10:39.725
Oh, I had a layover in Brunei.

10:39.760 --> 10:41.027
I don't know, it's a
possible connection.

10:41.061 --> 10:42.695
I mean, I was in Phnom Penh in March.

10:42.729 --> 10:45.398
Brunei, Jakarta, Singapore. They
were all in the sphere of Indonesia.

10:45.432 --> 10:47.400
Maybe that's a starting point.

10:47.471 --> 10:49.068
Maybe we should stop listening to you.

10:49.103 --> 10:51.104
- Give him a chance.
- Why?

10:51.138 --> 10:54.207
I know Harry Doyle
better than anyone here,

10:54.241 --> 10:58.044
and I know he'd manipulate a situation
to serve himself any chance he got.

10:58.078 --> 11:00.213
If anyone's a terrorist
hiding amongst us, it's him.

11:00.247 --> 11:01.847
What you're all doing right now

11:01.872 --> 11:03.983
is giving him reason to kill you.

11:06.253 --> 11:07.854
I missed you, Alex.

11:07.888 --> 11:09.388
Yeah, well, that makes one of us.

11:09.423 --> 11:10.974
Still bitter over being kicked out?

11:10.999 --> 11:12.992
I wasn't kicked out,
Lydia. You threw me out.

11:13.026 --> 11:15.296
I don't regret what I had to do.

11:15.772 --> 11:17.396
Why would you?

11:17.431 --> 11:19.565
With me gone, your
prize pupil rose fast.

11:19.600 --> 11:21.742
Ryan made his own choices.

11:21.766 --> 11:24.770
My father, on the other hand,
didn't have a say, did he?

11:25.147 --> 11:28.608
- I tried to apologize for that.
- Try it in person next time.

11:28.642 --> 11:31.679
Federal prisons allow
visitors once a month.

11:32.222 --> 11:33.222
_

11:33.247 --> 11:36.882
The decision to launch a drone
strike in order to kill an HVI,

11:36.907 --> 11:40.818
or High Value Individual, is
not one to be taken lightly.

11:41.100 --> 11:44.123
Before a strike, CIA protocols dictate

11:44.158 --> 11:46.926
that seven criteria must be satisfied.

11:46.960 --> 11:48.928
To that end, each team will examine

11:48.962 --> 11:53.232
one of these criteria and decide if
a drone strike should be authorized.

11:53.267 --> 11:55.434
All seven teams must agree

11:55.469 --> 11:57.540
in order for the strike to proceed.

11:57.649 --> 12:01.812
This case was active in 2011,
so let's travel back in time

12:02.009 --> 12:04.744
to before the destruction of Aleppo.

12:04.778 --> 12:08.948
First question... is there
legal basis for the strike?

12:08.982 --> 12:11.717
So, our HVI does not reside or operate

12:11.752 --> 12:14.654
in a NATO treaty country, and
the target's crimes include

12:14.688 --> 12:16.322
the execution of American journalists.

12:16.356 --> 12:18.954
This qualifies as legal basis.

12:19.660 --> 12:21.994
Is the target an imminent threat?

12:22.029 --> 12:24.630
I saw you this morning in the kitchen

12:24.665 --> 12:27.105
Skyping with your son.
This must be hard for you.

12:27.130 --> 12:28.988
My parents are surgeons.

12:29.013 --> 12:31.206
From them, I learned how to
focus on the task in front of me

12:31.231 --> 12:34.507
so I can focus on home when I'm home.

12:34.541 --> 12:37.944
Question three... will there be
minimal non-combatant casualties?

12:37.978 --> 12:39.612
So, Nasser's pattern of life activity

12:39.646 --> 12:41.414
suggests he's rarely near civilians.

12:41.448 --> 12:43.950
I think there'd be next to no
casualties outside of our target.

12:43.984 --> 12:45.184
- Hey.
- Yes?

12:45.219 --> 12:48.988
So, I heard you still haven't given
your statement to the media office.

12:49.022 --> 12:50.843
Sorry, I haven't gotten around to it.

12:50.868 --> 12:53.292
We need to give the press something,
in case they ask where you are.

12:53.327 --> 12:55.461
You risk being exposed, and
I'd hate to see you leave

12:55.495 --> 12:57.616
when you're finally starting
to come into your own here.

12:57.641 --> 13:00.749
Four... after communications
with military forces in the area,

13:00.774 --> 13:04.749
you must determine, is on
the ground capture impossible?

13:04.774 --> 13:06.138
That would be a big fat yes.

13:06.173 --> 13:07.673
His compound is too well protected.

13:07.708 --> 13:09.909
It's a, uh... a locked box.

13:10.177 --> 13:13.682
Not unlike my good
friend Ryan here, huh?

13:13.981 --> 13:15.611
- Now's not the time.
- Oh, really? Not the time?

13:15.636 --> 13:16.782
Should I get my calendar open?

13:16.817 --> 13:18.939
Maybe I can find something a
little more convenient for us both.

13:18.964 --> 13:20.839
Yeah, well, you of all
people should understand

13:20.864 --> 13:23.322
the meaning of need to know,
and you don't need to know.

13:23.357 --> 13:24.637
Not yet.

13:25.192 --> 13:27.326
I'll tell you what I can when
I have the clearance to do so.

13:27.361 --> 13:28.810
Now lay off.

13:29.973 --> 13:33.235
Will weather permit the
drone to deliver its payload?

13:33.260 --> 13:36.868
Clouds, rain, snow, they all can obscure

13:36.893 --> 13:39.571
our weapons-sighting
systems and cause a misfire.

13:39.605 --> 13:41.103
The weather in Aleppo is optimal.

13:41.119 --> 13:42.887
Average wind speeds
are 4 miles per hour,

13:42.921 --> 13:45.056
cloud cover 39%, 10 hours of daylight.

13:45.221 --> 13:46.697
We can sign off.

13:47.959 --> 13:50.728
My background research
on Nasser's a little thin.

13:50.762 --> 13:52.111
Nil, actually.

13:52.400 --> 13:54.632
I couldn't finish it because
I was occupied all weekend.

13:54.666 --> 13:55.933
Not a fan of cheating.

13:55.967 --> 13:58.219
Oh, she and I are both single.

13:58.244 --> 13:59.720
Promise there's no cheating.

14:00.839 --> 14:02.078
I'll help you this time.

14:02.107 --> 14:04.742
Next time you fall behind, it's on you.

14:06.578 --> 14:08.479
Six... is there enough confidence

14:08.513 --> 14:10.463
in the relevant government
that they will not

14:10.488 --> 14:12.535
or cannot retaliate?

14:12.817 --> 14:14.585
Intelligence indicates
the Syrian government

14:14.619 --> 14:16.387
does not have the ability to retaliate

14:16.421 --> 14:18.902
against U.S.-backed forces in the area.

14:19.357 --> 14:21.392
Good work, Sebastian.

14:24.362 --> 14:26.931
Is a drone strike the only option?

14:26.965 --> 14:28.899
U.S. special operations
forces are in the area,

14:28.934 --> 14:30.801
but only in an advisory capacity.

14:30.835 --> 14:32.530
We can't get him. Drones can.

14:32.555 --> 14:34.322
It's our only option.

14:34.506 --> 14:37.141
Very good. Thank you, team.

14:41.187 --> 14:45.216
You know, I'd steer clear of the,
uh, Artful Dodger if I were you.

14:45.250 --> 14:47.184
I'm not trying to play
peacekeeper or anything,

14:47.219 --> 14:49.420
but there's more to him than you know.

14:49.454 --> 14:51.355
Oh, I know. Trust me.

14:51.389 --> 14:55.292
What I mean is the whole Artful
Dodger thing, it's just his bluster.

14:55.327 --> 14:59.330
He's had pain in his life...
real pain, like everyone.

14:59.364 --> 15:01.832
Sure he didn't just give
you some story to play you?

15:01.866 --> 15:04.293
He's the kind of guy that'd
do that sort of thing.

15:04.569 --> 15:06.699
No one would lie about suicide.

15:08.573 --> 15:10.007
Family member?

15:10.041 --> 15:11.738
His boyfriend.

15:15.914 --> 15:18.115
You know that personal
detail from Harry's past

15:18.149 --> 15:20.017
we've been looking for
to create a cover story?

15:20.051 --> 15:22.091
I just found it.

15:26.893 --> 15:30.385
MI6 has done nothing but tell us Harry
Doyle is an officer in their ranks.

15:30.424 --> 15:32.963
I can't even find proof
that he exists beyond that.

15:32.998 --> 15:34.885
They have covered his
tracks nice and good.

15:37.737 --> 15:38.969
Caleb?

15:39.004 --> 15:41.071
Did I tell you you
could look at my phone?

15:41.106 --> 15:42.306
I have a license to snoop.

15:42.340 --> 15:44.408
Oh, well, not without a warrant.

15:44.442 --> 15:46.105
Is he here for the ceremony?

15:47.212 --> 15:48.679
Oh, maybe that's him.

15:48.713 --> 15:50.381
It's Ryan. He found something.

15:50.415 --> 15:52.616
Finally something to work with.

15:54.848 --> 15:58.269
You seem to have made a
unanimous decision to strike.

15:58.590 --> 16:00.658
Well, I have no doubt you all feel

16:00.692 --> 16:03.347
incredibly confident
in your answers, but...

16:04.029 --> 16:06.363
what happens away from the desks?

16:06.398 --> 16:07.698
You go home.

16:07.732 --> 16:11.201
You turn on the news, and you
see what your report has wrought.

16:11.236 --> 16:13.604
Why feel guilty if
the target was guilty?

16:13.638 --> 16:15.205
Sometimes you make a mistake.

16:15.247 --> 16:20.174
Sometimes the powers that be slant
intel to justify their intentions,

16:20.202 --> 16:22.279
but, you know, you're
using the wrong tense.

16:22.314 --> 16:25.949
Question should be,
is the target guilty?

16:25.984 --> 16:27.785
We never got Nasser in 2011.

16:27.819 --> 16:29.420
He went underground.

16:29.454 --> 16:31.622
And after the bombings in
the Philippines last year,

16:31.656 --> 16:33.856
we found him again, so...

16:34.123 --> 16:37.784
leaving immediately, we'll be going
to the Drone Command Center at Langley,

16:37.809 --> 16:41.198
where you will be making the
actual decision to strike.

16:41.232 --> 16:44.468
That is a live POV from the ball,

16:44.502 --> 16:48.299
the onboard nose camera
of the MQ-9A Reaper drone,

16:48.324 --> 16:51.308
in flight and on its way
to the target in Aleppo.

16:51.343 --> 16:54.312
This was launched from a classified
partner air base in the region.

16:54.337 --> 16:57.968
The CIA techs you see are working
in conjunction with drone pilots,

16:57.993 --> 17:02.165
out of Creech Air Force Base in
Nevada, to execute this strike.

17:02.594 --> 17:05.255
Do we kill a man today or not?

17:05.290 --> 17:07.852
Red light or green light. You decide.

17:07.877 --> 17:11.035
The window to execute the
strike closes in 22 minutes.

17:11.060 --> 17:13.262
Now that you know that it's not a drill,

17:13.298 --> 17:16.333
re-evaluate the criteria
and make the true call.

17:16.367 --> 17:19.369
Today, someone's life is in your hands.

17:20.208 --> 17:21.856
_

17:28.380 --> 17:31.106
How do you know what
happened to me today?

17:31.549 --> 17:34.114
- Do you know where we're going?
- I speak Swahili.

17:34.139 --> 17:36.153
I overheard the
terrorists talking in ab...

17:49.890 --> 17:51.405
Help me.

17:52.522 --> 17:53.655
Okay.

17:53.690 --> 17:55.123
Put your head down.

17:57.728 --> 17:59.095
Careful. Don't move.

18:00.230 --> 18:03.366
So, Saint Sebastian
thinks I'm a terrorist.

18:03.400 --> 18:06.212
- What proof have you got?
- Did you or did you not...

18:06.237 --> 18:09.524
spend your time at The Farm as an
undercover agent for a foreign power?

18:09.549 --> 18:13.141
So what? Everyone knows that. It was
sanctioned by the Director of the CIA.

18:13.166 --> 18:17.013
Yeah, but you successfully kept
it from all of us there with you.

18:17.047 --> 18:18.781
Good. That was the point.

18:18.823 --> 18:21.640
No, the point is who knows what you're
successfully keeping from us now?

18:21.719 --> 18:23.219
Who knows what anyone's
keeping from anyone?

18:23.244 --> 18:24.854
You're as much a suspect as I am.

18:24.888 --> 18:25.969
I'm not a killer.

18:26.009 --> 18:28.578
- I've never killed anyone.
- No, you almost killed me once.

18:28.612 --> 18:29.753
Who knows what you've done since then?

18:29.778 --> 18:30.823
Okay, that's enough.

18:30.848 --> 18:33.176
Hey, I'd back down if you don't
want the spotlight on you next.

18:33.201 --> 18:34.617
Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, he's right.

18:34.651 --> 18:37.144
Apart from me and him, you have whole
areas of your life unaccounted for.

18:37.169 --> 18:39.622
Oh, they're accounted for.
Just maybe not accurately.

18:39.656 --> 18:41.491
This coming from a man

18:41.525 --> 18:44.973
who spent a decade as a
voluntary witness for murder.

18:45.082 --> 18:46.829
I record history, I don't make it.

18:46.864 --> 18:48.473
You think that clicking the shutter

18:48.535 --> 18:50.666
is any less of a crime
than pulling the trigger?

18:50.701 --> 18:53.784
You let people die in front of you,

18:53.809 --> 18:55.972
and you did nothing to stop it.

18:56.006 --> 18:59.042
Hey. You're supposed to be
trying to stop these terrorists.

18:59.067 --> 19:01.010
Not tear each other apart.

19:01.223 --> 19:04.626
She's right. Whatever your
issues with each other are,

19:04.653 --> 19:06.788
they're not helping us
solve our problems now.

19:06.822 --> 19:09.691
And why should we listen to you?
None of us even know who you are.

19:09.725 --> 19:12.860
The only people who did have been
taken out of here to who knows where.

19:12.895 --> 19:14.762
Why are you here, Sebastian?

19:14.797 --> 19:17.966
Everyone else has said why, but not you.

19:22.705 --> 19:24.806
This has got to be tough on you.

19:24.840 --> 19:26.799
Especially given the timing.

19:27.576 --> 19:28.935
I'm fine.

19:29.311 --> 19:31.713
Given my statement and everything.

19:31.747 --> 19:33.948
All right, you have 17 minutes.

19:33.983 --> 19:35.717
Does the target live or die?

19:41.323 --> 19:43.858
Hey, I think I found something
to create a cover story.

19:43.892 --> 19:45.493
It's from the Williamsburg Gazette.

19:45.527 --> 19:48.896
Three years ago, there was an
apparent suicide at Camp Peary.

19:48.931 --> 19:51.633
They don't say if it was an
employee, recruit, or a soldier.

19:51.667 --> 19:54.102
It doesn't matter. We can use it.

19:59.208 --> 20:00.879
Caleb again.

20:15.080 --> 20:16.602
Good timing.

20:16.696 --> 20:18.330
I just got clearance to talk to you.

20:18.364 --> 20:19.431
Where, here?

20:19.465 --> 20:20.967
As good a place as any.

20:20.992 --> 20:22.446
Okay, well, I'm all ears.

20:22.471 --> 20:24.906
Truly, and also.

20:27.240 --> 20:29.608
What do you think happens when
there's a death at The Farm?

20:29.642 --> 20:31.843
I guess they plant the
bodies at a social club

20:31.878 --> 20:34.381
and get the recruits to play clean up.

20:34.725 --> 20:38.383
The FBI investigates. We police the CIA.

20:38.417 --> 20:42.120
But sometimes the CIA doesn't like that.

20:42.348 --> 20:44.791
Three years ago, a
recruit killed himself.

20:44.816 --> 20:47.893
The Bureau suspected foul
play, but got shut out.

20:47.918 --> 20:49.895
And that's why we're here.

20:50.840 --> 20:53.629
To find out what
happened and get justice.

20:54.199 --> 20:55.801
Well, that's good.

20:56.785 --> 20:58.937
Justice, yeah. That's important.

20:59.163 --> 21:02.240
Good friend of mine killed
himself a few years back,

21:02.275 --> 21:05.277
and that suicide haunts
me to this very day,

21:05.311 --> 21:09.997
so I feel sympathy for you
and your quest for justice.

21:10.683 --> 21:13.051
At least that's how
this was meant to go.

21:13.085 --> 21:15.363
Right? That's what
you was hoping I'd say.

21:15.388 --> 21:17.756
If you're gonna use my
past to manipulate me,

21:17.790 --> 21:20.625
make sure it's not a story I made
up to manipulate someone else.

21:20.660 --> 21:22.561
Strike two.

21:22.595 --> 21:24.229
Try again, Ryan.

21:25.025 --> 21:27.314
You miss the next one, and you're out.

21:28.696 --> 21:30.650
Let's go back inside, shall we?

21:36.943 --> 21:38.143
Our answer stands.

21:38.177 --> 21:40.111
There's no viable
alternative to a strike,

21:40.146 --> 21:42.581
so Owen's getting a yes from our team.

21:42.615 --> 21:44.816
Yeah. We agree.

21:44.871 --> 21:47.176
The Syrian government
will not retaliate.

21:47.293 --> 21:49.154
Leigh, no phones, remember?

21:49.188 --> 21:50.488
We support the strike.

21:50.523 --> 21:52.495
Well, you're not gonna
get a yes from my team.

21:52.520 --> 21:54.659
The target is not an imminent threat.

21:54.694 --> 21:56.294
He hasn't been directly
linked to anything

21:56.329 --> 21:58.797
since the bombing in Manila last year,

21:58.831 --> 22:00.665
and even that evidence is shaky.

22:00.700 --> 22:03.468
But he has been indirectly
linked to many things.

22:03.502 --> 22:05.503
I vetted the entire scenario,

22:05.538 --> 22:07.940
and it will stand up to legal scrutiny.

22:08.112 --> 22:10.534
- It's a yes from us.
- What about moral scrutiny?

22:10.589 --> 22:13.326
- Can we really live with this?
- Well, we could an hour ago.

22:13.358 --> 22:16.559
All the relevant criteria still
points to a yes. Nothing's changed.

22:16.584 --> 22:19.484
But things have changed.
This isn't academic anymore.

22:19.518 --> 22:21.106
This is real.

22:21.131 --> 22:22.897
We can't afford to make a mistake.

22:22.922 --> 22:24.889
I assume no one's made a mistake before.

22:24.924 --> 22:26.791
Yeah. Seems open and shut to me.

22:26.826 --> 22:31.102
Owen said the powers that be sometimes
slant intel to justify their reasons.

22:31.289 --> 22:33.865
How do we know Nasser's as
guilty as we've been told?

22:33.899 --> 22:35.900
We didn't conduct this investigation.

22:35.935 --> 22:38.662
We have whatever the
CIA's given us on paper.

22:38.687 --> 22:40.305
We can't be sure of anything.

22:40.339 --> 22:43.475
This paper tells a
pretty dark tale, okay?

22:43.509 --> 22:45.710
So, it's a yes vote
from my group, as well.

22:45.745 --> 22:47.332
We're talking about a human life here.

22:47.357 --> 22:49.479
Yeah, of a dangerous man, a murderer.

22:49.504 --> 22:53.084
Is this about Nasser, or our
feelings on the death penalty?

22:53.119 --> 22:56.721
Because while I don't believe in it,
that doesn't matter in this scenario.

22:56.756 --> 22:59.299
I'm just saying we don't
have enough information.

22:59.324 --> 23:02.661
Now that we're actually talking
about whether or not to kill someone,

23:02.686 --> 23:05.897
- I have to agree with Alex.
- Sure you do, Saint Sebastian.

23:05.931 --> 23:07.221
This isn't about faith.

23:07.246 --> 23:09.701
I know it isn't because I was
raised Catholic just like you were,

23:09.735 --> 23:11.336
and I believe God would
want this man dead.

23:11.370 --> 23:12.937
You don't speak for God.

23:12.972 --> 23:15.607
You shouldn't even have a voice in this
conversation. You didn't do the work.

23:15.641 --> 23:18.943
Okay. So, it's a no from
me, Sebastian, and Leigh.

23:18.978 --> 23:21.797
The strike isn't gonna
happen. We're just not ready.

23:22.555 --> 23:24.155
What do you think you're doing?

23:24.180 --> 23:26.551
You think drumming up no votes
is gonna advance our mission here?

23:26.585 --> 23:28.720
The AIC recruits assassins.

23:28.754 --> 23:30.922
I'm going with my conscience, Ryan.

23:30.956 --> 23:33.173
I know this is probably easier
for you. You were a soldier.

23:33.198 --> 23:35.026
You think killing doesn't weigh on me?

23:35.175 --> 23:37.753
Taking a life is never easy.

23:38.417 --> 23:40.865
But this isn't about
morality. This is about duty.

23:40.900 --> 23:42.901
Look, I know you're upset, okay?

23:42.935 --> 23:46.438
I know that today is also
not just about this scenario.

23:46.472 --> 23:49.240
- But try not to bring that into this.
- How can I not?

23:49.275 --> 23:50.775
Because it's been a year.

23:50.810 --> 23:54.913
Because it's our job and because
saving that man won't bring back Simon.

24:21.113 --> 24:22.714
The drives are in there.

24:27.019 --> 24:29.888
Hand me the phone. I'll input the code.

24:29.922 --> 24:32.357
Time to put an end to this.

24:35.968 --> 24:37.960
Is this how it's always gonna be?

24:37.985 --> 24:40.523
On pins and needles waiting
for them to report back?

24:41.008 --> 24:43.143
It reminds me of the agony of waiting

24:43.177 --> 24:45.412
to swap out with Raina
when we were undercover.

24:45.875 --> 24:47.547
Do you miss working with her?

24:47.992 --> 24:49.649
We were so close.

24:50.269 --> 24:52.819
We had, like, a sixth
sense about each other.

24:52.853 --> 24:58.340
But now I can't even help her through
the pain she must be feeling today,

24:58.855 --> 25:02.562
the anniversary of losing
the man she deeply loved.

25:02.597 --> 25:04.898
Wait, are you not speaking?

25:04.932 --> 25:07.601
We do, but it's not the same.

25:07.635 --> 25:10.006
I'm a reminder of all that pain.

25:10.031 --> 25:12.365
I know you're hurting.

25:12.390 --> 25:13.807
I am, too.

25:13.841 --> 25:16.910
Is that why you've been
avoiding Caleb today?

25:16.944 --> 25:18.452
I called Miranda.

25:18.553 --> 25:20.827
She told me you were
invited to the ceremony.

25:20.852 --> 25:24.693
Claire Haas made sure of it
herself, and you didn't go.

25:24.728 --> 25:27.429
There's a lot of reasons
that I am avoiding Caleb.

25:27.464 --> 25:28.831
They don't have to do with Claire.

25:28.865 --> 25:31.667
Do they have to do with León Velez?

25:31.701 --> 25:35.671
Because his cellphone number is saved
under Caleb's name in your phone.

25:35.705 --> 25:37.272
I'm a snoop.

25:37.307 --> 25:38.807
I told you.

25:38.842 --> 25:40.642
I watched you key in your code,

25:40.677 --> 25:44.213
and I looked at your phone
when you went to the restroom.

25:47.988 --> 25:51.048
I have only four yes votes. I need
a consensus, and I need it now.

25:51.073 --> 25:54.071
Request permission to sparkle
once we get PID of the truck.

25:54.096 --> 25:55.657
I see the vehicle.

25:55.692 --> 25:57.393
Permission to sparkle affirmative.

25:57.427 --> 25:59.628
We are live and ready. Are you?

25:59.662 --> 26:00.963
We still have three minutes to decide.

26:00.997 --> 26:02.364
There's no reason to cut it close.

26:02.389 --> 26:04.323
Yes, there is. There's a
man's life on the table.

26:04.348 --> 26:05.367
There's every reason.

26:05.402 --> 26:07.118
Leigh, have you changed your mind?

26:07.143 --> 26:09.312
I wish I could say yes, but I can't.

26:09.343 --> 26:11.537
I prefer a clean conscience.

26:11.562 --> 26:14.009
Unless someone can give me
incontrovertible evidence

26:14.043 --> 26:17.881
that this man is a terrorist instead
of just conjecture and intuition,

26:17.906 --> 26:19.681
then I'm gonna have to keep with my no.

26:19.724 --> 26:22.127
And if this man lives
and brings more violence

26:22.152 --> 26:26.059
to his people, to your doorstep,
to your children, Leigh,

26:26.169 --> 26:28.082
will you regret that?

26:32.295 --> 26:34.763
You're right. You're right.

26:34.798 --> 26:36.590
This isn't about conscience.

26:36.615 --> 26:39.444
If the law's on our side, I vote yes.

26:40.334 --> 26:41.703
Systems ready.

26:41.738 --> 26:43.906
Standing by for your go order.

26:43.940 --> 26:45.407
Come on, Sebastian,
what are you waiting for?

26:45.442 --> 26:46.909
God to say it's okay?

26:46.943 --> 26:48.911
If you were standing by
that target right now,

26:48.945 --> 26:51.180
you'd be setting up a tripod
instead of warning anyone.

26:51.214 --> 26:52.881
And you'd be sitting
here using your religion

26:52.916 --> 26:54.850
to make a choice for you because
you can't make it yourself.

26:54.884 --> 26:57.500
Much like I imagine you've done
in other aspects of your life.

26:57.525 --> 26:59.307
Isn't that right, Harry?

26:59.789 --> 27:02.524
It is one thing for
you to make fun of me,

27:02.559 --> 27:04.726
but to bring other people
into it as if it's fact.

27:04.761 --> 27:06.562
Yeah, okay, well,
that's not what I said.

27:06.596 --> 27:09.965
No, once and for all,
Harry, I'm not gay.

27:09.999 --> 27:12.267
I never was, I never will be.

27:12.302 --> 27:13.936
And just 'cause I'm the
first man you met in your life

27:13.970 --> 27:15.871
that didn't drop on all
fours after meeting you

27:15.905 --> 27:19.208
doesn't give you the right
to assassinate my character.

27:19.242 --> 27:20.776
I vote yes.

27:20.810 --> 27:21.944
The guy's guilty.

27:21.978 --> 27:23.712
90 seconds to target.

27:23.746 --> 27:26.982
Alex, we all know what today is for you.

27:27.274 --> 27:30.246
Anyone with access
to the Internet knows.

27:30.308 --> 27:34.012
But don't make this about
what happened to your friends.

27:34.136 --> 27:37.066
Make this about guaranteeing
another day like that

27:37.093 --> 27:39.780
doesn't happen to the people of Syria.

27:40.864 --> 27:44.366
Do the right thing, like
you did a year ago today.

27:47.846 --> 27:50.105
Of course you'd have a hard time
making a choice like this today.

27:50.139 --> 27:52.140
Another life taken a year to the day?

27:52.175 --> 27:55.811
Look, Alex... maybe you
should recuse yourself.

27:55.845 --> 27:56.945
Owen would understand.

27:56.980 --> 27:59.174
I just don't want to say yes
without all the information.

27:59.199 --> 28:01.350
Well, you never have
all the information.

28:01.384 --> 28:03.513
There's no way to. You
have to go on instinct.

28:03.538 --> 28:04.732
I have that.

28:04.757 --> 28:05.787
I just don't have it here.

28:05.822 --> 28:08.290
It has to be unanimous, doesn't it?

28:08.324 --> 28:10.792
If you're not feeling
it, then I'm not, either.

28:10.827 --> 28:13.195
Look, unlike the rest of them,
we're actual agents, aren't we?

28:13.229 --> 28:14.863
Well, I'm an officer.

28:14.898 --> 28:16.865
But the point is if a
fellow officer said to me

28:16.900 --> 28:20.251
she felt her instincts were
saying this was the wrong call,

28:20.276 --> 28:22.004
I would trust her on that.

28:22.038 --> 28:24.439
- Okay.
- What?

28:24.474 --> 28:26.041
I change my vote, too.

28:26.075 --> 28:28.544
- Don't do it for me.
- This is what we do.

28:28.578 --> 28:30.879
We get information,
we weigh the options,

28:30.914 --> 28:32.347
we talk about it, and decide.

28:32.392 --> 28:34.626
We're not lone gunmen. We're a team.

28:34.651 --> 28:37.586
- And I'm on your side.
- Yeah. So am I.

28:39.589 --> 28:41.056
It's a no.

28:41.090 --> 28:42.824
10 seconds until target is in range.

28:42.859 --> 28:45.794
So, that's it? What
happens now? Is it over?

28:45.828 --> 28:47.122
Of course not.

28:48.064 --> 28:50.152
- Do it.
- Yes, sir.

28:50.177 --> 28:53.302
Reaper, you are free to engage.

28:53.630 --> 28:57.247
Three, two, one.

29:03.012 --> 29:06.048
Confirmed. Target is neutralized.

29:18.358 --> 29:20.028
Okay.

29:20.063 --> 29:21.496
These need to be destroyed.

29:21.531 --> 29:23.899
No, we have more leverage
if we hold on to them.

29:23.933 --> 29:26.546
We can use them to negotiate
for the other hostages.

29:26.639 --> 29:28.704
No, we can't. These are too valuable.

29:28.738 --> 29:31.311
They have to be destroyed.

29:32.660 --> 29:34.103
What is that?

29:34.790 --> 29:35.811
What is it?!

29:35.845 --> 29:38.115
That's a remote control for the collars.

29:38.181 --> 29:40.616
I stole it off the terrorist I killed.

29:40.650 --> 29:43.591
I had to convince you I was a victim.

29:43.953 --> 29:45.921
You can put the gun down now.

29:45.955 --> 29:47.556
You only have one round left.

29:47.590 --> 29:49.286
Are you really going to risk it?

29:54.430 --> 29:56.765
Yeah, Sebastian, we all told the truth.

29:56.799 --> 29:58.433
What about you?

29:58.468 --> 30:00.769
I don't want to give them
anything they can use against me.

30:00.803 --> 30:03.405
You could be one. Anyone could be.

30:03.439 --> 30:05.907
- What are you hiding, Sebastian?
- Nothing.

30:05.942 --> 30:08.744
No? Then why are you here, huh?

30:08.778 --> 30:12.014
- Why are you here?
- I'm here with my wife, okay?

30:13.983 --> 30:15.735
I'm her guest.

30:16.152 --> 30:18.954
You're here with your wife? Why
was that such a big deal to say?

30:18.988 --> 30:20.376
I guess it wasn't.

30:20.901 --> 30:23.158
We need to keep looking
for the connection.

30:23.192 --> 30:25.494
Harry in Phnom Penh, Dayana in Brunei,

30:25.528 --> 30:28.096
me in Surabaya, but we're
not getting any closer.

30:28.141 --> 30:30.575
- You said Jakarta.
- Right.

30:30.600 --> 30:32.634
Jakarta, but I connected
through Surabaya.

30:32.669 --> 30:34.770
- _
- What? No!

30:34.804 --> 30:36.271
Oh, my God, no!

30:36.305 --> 30:38.006
Where are you taking me?!

30:38.041 --> 30:39.441
No! Harry!

30:39.475 --> 30:41.076
Dayana!

31:07.383 --> 31:09.751
So, that's why you
were late this morning.

31:09.785 --> 31:11.797
That's what you've been
doing the whole week.

31:11.822 --> 31:14.491
Sleeping with the man
who could get you fired.

31:14.516 --> 31:15.624
Why?

31:15.658 --> 31:18.445
Why compromise the
entire mission for sex?

31:18.469 --> 31:19.970
You don't get it.

31:20.004 --> 31:21.137
I don't.

31:21.172 --> 31:23.306
He doesn't know me, Nimah.

31:23.341 --> 31:25.709
He thinks that my
parents are still alive,

31:25.743 --> 31:28.044
that I have a sister I'm close to,

31:28.079 --> 31:29.980
an ex that I stayed friends with,

31:30.014 --> 31:32.115
a simple job in a small town

31:32.149 --> 31:34.948
where no one died and I
didn't make terrible decisions

31:34.973 --> 31:37.120
that I'm gonna have
to live with forever.

31:37.154 --> 31:39.689
When you and your
sister played each other,

31:39.724 --> 31:41.791
you got to escape.

31:41.826 --> 31:43.994
I have never been able
to escape anything.

31:44.028 --> 31:45.862
Damn it.

31:52.003 --> 31:53.370
How close did you get?

31:53.413 --> 31:54.705
Does he trust you?

31:54.730 --> 31:58.783
I don't know. I mean, we don't
talk that much, but I think so.

31:58.923 --> 32:03.298
Did he give you his real name,
where he lives, where he's been?

32:03.478 --> 32:05.382
Yes, he did.

32:05.416 --> 32:08.018
Maybe you can get somewhere with him.

32:08.861 --> 32:12.756
What if I talked to Miranda
about you going undercover?

32:12.790 --> 32:14.024
Are you serious?

32:14.058 --> 32:18.061
You might just be the break we've
been waiting for in our case.

32:18.658 --> 32:23.173
Being an operative means
living with pain you cause.

32:23.377 --> 32:25.068
I don't mean hurting someone's feelings.

32:25.102 --> 32:27.283
I mean taking a life.

32:27.872 --> 32:29.339
Betraying a friend.

32:29.373 --> 32:31.074
Breaking a heart.

32:31.108 --> 32:32.676
Pain doesn't know right and wrong.

32:33.048 --> 32:35.912
It lives with you regardless.

32:35.946 --> 32:38.048
I know you had doubts
today. I know you faltered.

32:38.082 --> 32:42.018
But I want you all to know the
target that was killed was guilty.

32:42.053 --> 32:43.586
There was no doubt.

32:43.621 --> 32:45.247
Then why tell us you weren't sure?

32:45.272 --> 32:47.557
It's easy to live with a righteous kill.

32:47.591 --> 32:50.593
But making that same
decision with uncertainty

32:50.628 --> 32:52.862
is what makes you worthy of the CIA.

32:57.171 --> 32:58.735
We killed a man today.

32:58.769 --> 33:01.351
- Yeah, a man who deserved it.
- That was this time.

33:01.376 --> 33:04.217
- But next time?
- I've had to do worse.

33:04.975 --> 33:07.177
So will you if you stay here.

33:09.499 --> 33:11.081
He's right.

33:11.115 --> 33:12.882
Haven't you noticed?

33:12.917 --> 33:15.919
The lessons are getting
harder, not easier.

33:15.953 --> 33:17.754
And you're okay with that?

33:17.788 --> 33:19.389
With what the CIA's doing here?

33:19.423 --> 33:21.925
Training people to kill
and just be okay with it.

33:21.959 --> 33:24.327
I like reading my kids bedtime stories

33:24.362 --> 33:28.231
about princesses fighting
monsters and saving their kingdoms.

33:29.800 --> 33:31.374
I don't want to be that monster.

33:31.399 --> 33:32.802
You're not.

33:32.837 --> 33:34.938
You're the princess that fights them.

33:34.972 --> 33:36.072
How do you know?

33:36.107 --> 33:38.074
How can you be sure?

33:47.385 --> 33:49.246
Peace offering?

33:58.028 --> 34:00.764
- It's good whisky.
- Yeah? Penderyn.

34:00.798 --> 34:03.967
It's about the only nice
thing to come out of Wales.

34:04.001 --> 34:05.364
Look.

34:06.270 --> 34:09.806
You and Alex today, I
totally respect that.

34:09.840 --> 34:12.525
You don't see passion and
purpose in most people these days,

34:12.551 --> 34:14.268
and what I said to Alex is true.

34:14.300 --> 34:17.632
As officers, we may not
always have all the facts,

34:17.657 --> 34:20.284
but we do always have intuition.

34:20.411 --> 34:24.106
When you do it enough, you can
channel all of your pain into it.

34:25.270 --> 34:27.857
A mistake today stops
you making it tomorrow.

34:27.891 --> 34:33.590
And... death teaches you
the weight of that mistake.

34:36.411 --> 34:37.856
Look, Ryan...

34:39.676 --> 34:41.471
whatever you and Alex are into here,

34:41.505 --> 34:43.039
I'm not gonna stand in your way.

34:43.072 --> 34:46.887
Okay? Just consider that
professional courtesy

34:46.911 --> 34:49.489
from one undercover agent to another.

34:50.347 --> 34:51.915
Thank you.

34:51.949 --> 34:53.382
Well, when I said I
wouldn't stand in your way,

34:53.417 --> 34:56.085
I didn't mean I wouldn't
find out. I do outclass you,

34:56.110 --> 34:59.422
so my people are going straight
to your boss, but on the flip side,

34:59.457 --> 35:02.926
at least you won't be
responsible for telling me.

35:02.960 --> 35:06.693
Alex must be feeling
particularly down after today.

35:06.931 --> 35:09.265
She should be with someone she loves.

35:09.300 --> 35:11.334
And what makes you think she loves me?

35:13.184 --> 35:14.778
Go on.

35:15.473 --> 35:17.440
I'll cover for you.

35:23.574 --> 35:24.607
You're one of them.

35:24.642 --> 35:27.710
I knew you wouldn't believe
me if I tried to explain.

35:27.745 --> 35:29.045
I'm CIA.

35:29.079 --> 35:33.183
I have a duty to secure these hard
drives instead of destroying them.

35:33.217 --> 35:36.380
It's a matter of national security.

35:36.654 --> 35:39.088
I'm so glad I didn't become who you are.

35:39.123 --> 35:41.958
But the next time I see
you, I will kill you.

35:42.493 --> 35:44.527
You won't see me again.

35:50.679 --> 35:52.632
Goodbye, Alex.

36:01.596 --> 36:04.147
They weren't CIA aliases.

36:04.181 --> 36:07.128
I'm sorry, but at least now you know.

36:08.986 --> 36:10.770
You're lying.

36:10.988 --> 36:13.423
You found those aliases in the database.

36:13.457 --> 36:17.332
You know who they belong to,
yet you're keeping them from me.

36:17.661 --> 36:19.929
I've given these people my life.

36:19.964 --> 36:23.294
I've spent 15 years making them
the perfect soldiers they asked for,

36:23.319 --> 36:25.969
and I do it because this is the
closest I can get to what I want,

36:26.003 --> 36:27.136
to what I lost.

36:27.163 --> 36:29.120
So if you know right now
that what I've been doing here

36:29.145 --> 36:31.007
is a carefully curated falsehood,

36:31.041 --> 36:32.775
- I'd appre...
- You need to drop this!

36:32.810 --> 36:35.361
- For your own good.
- I don't need protecting.

36:35.386 --> 36:36.813
I need answers.

36:36.847 --> 36:38.815
And if it happened another
way, I want justice.

36:38.849 --> 36:41.017
You think just because you
teach everyone what to do

36:41.051 --> 36:43.333
you'd survive a day out there?

36:43.854 --> 36:45.958
What's your cover?

36:46.890 --> 36:49.792
A tenured professor? A widowed judge?

36:49.827 --> 36:53.529
Where's that going to get you in
Bangladesh, in Egypt, in Syria?

36:53.564 --> 36:57.800
No matter what information I give
you, the answer will be the same.

36:57.835 --> 36:59.836
Your field career is over,

36:59.870 --> 37:02.839
and everyone at the
CIA knows it but you.

37:03.238 --> 37:06.207
All this time away from the field,

37:06.644 --> 37:09.605
I thought you'd have
learned perspective.

37:10.814 --> 37:14.050
And I'm right here in front of you,

37:14.084 --> 37:17.353
and all you can focus on are
the dreams that didn't come true.

37:31.622 --> 37:33.278
I'm sorry.

37:34.171 --> 37:36.906
I was so focused on today's scenario

37:36.940 --> 37:40.009
that I lost sight of how
much you were going through.

37:40.044 --> 37:44.847
And that focus was my way of not
feeling the pain of last year.

37:47.028 --> 37:49.130
Maybe I need to forget.

37:50.360 --> 37:52.466
Move past it.

37:53.624 --> 37:55.920
It's not going away.

37:56.126 --> 37:59.562
And we need to honor that, honor him.

38:03.842 --> 38:05.501
Are you ready?

38:12.876 --> 38:15.378
What is this ceremony called?

38:15.412 --> 38:17.213
An unveiling.

38:17.247 --> 38:19.749
A year to the day of
death in the Jewish faith,

38:19.783 --> 38:22.352
the tombstone is inscribed.

38:22.386 --> 38:24.387
And what are those?

38:24.421 --> 38:27.652
It's tradition to place
a rock on a headstone.

38:27.677 --> 38:32.222
It's a symbol of the lasting presence
of the deceased's life and memory.

38:32.863 --> 38:37.700
Tradition also states that those closest
should recite the Mourner's Kaddish.

38:37.735 --> 38:40.269
But we don't have 10
people for a minyan.

38:40.304 --> 38:42.323
I won't tell if you don't.

38:42.348 --> 38:43.722
Can you do it?

38:50.240 --> 38:53.732
Yit'gadal v'yit'kadash

38:53.757 --> 38:58.845

40:12.052 --> 40:14.076
Sebastian.

40:14.255 --> 40:18.607
The story I told you,
it wasn't a story, okay?

40:19.369 --> 40:24.073
I only told Ryan that because,
well, it's none of his business.

40:24.107 --> 40:26.809
I'm sorry if I made
you feel uncomfortable.

40:26.844 --> 40:29.530
I wouldn't want to do
that to anyone, ever.

40:31.487 --> 40:33.388
I don't care.

40:43.534 --> 40:46.027
Leigh. Leigh, are you okay?

40:46.052 --> 40:47.063
What happened?

40:47.097 --> 40:49.839
They just asked me questions about
where I've been for the last year.

40:50.112 --> 40:52.815
I told them I was only in
Surabaya my way to Jakarta.

40:53.378 --> 40:55.065
I don't know why they cared.

40:56.177 --> 40:57.707
What's that sound?

40:59.076 --> 41:00.843
- No, no, no, no, no!
- Oh, my God.

41:00.878 --> 41:02.378
Leigh.

41:11.922 --> 41:15.124
Raina, I was in Surabaya.
I don't want to die.

41:15.158 --> 41:16.323
Don't worry.

41:17.567 --> 41:19.362
I promise to stay with you.

41:19.396 --> 41:21.097
Where are you taking us?

41:21.131 --> 41:22.965
Harry! Help me!

41:23.000 --> 41:24.237
Harry!

41:24.262 --> 41:25.468
Oh, my God!

41:25.502 --> 41:27.303
I'm with you. I'm with you.

41:32.609 --> 41:33.943
Aah!

41:33.977 --> 41:35.077
No, no!

41:55.299 --> 41:57.233
You were right.

41:57.523 --> 41:59.430
Dayana may be one of them.

41:59.620 --> 42:02.589
Thank you. Your plan worked.
