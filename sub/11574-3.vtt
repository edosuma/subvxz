00:14.515 --> 00:17.632
[screaming]

00:17.727 --> 00:22.266
[BO] Kenzi! Kenzi? What is it,
huh? Are you okay?

00:22.356 --> 00:23.391
What's wrong?

00:23.482 --> 00:26.815
Cruddy broom totally bit me!

00:28.196 --> 00:30.858
ReaHy?

00:30.948 --> 00:35.317
Big talker who survives Basilisk
poisoning gets T.K.O.'d by a broom?

00:35.411 --> 00:38.027
Oh, like you've never been
suckered by a big shaft of wood?

00:38.122 --> 00:39.032
Hey!

00:39.123 --> 00:41.239
I'm sorry, okay, but
you're freaking me out.

00:41.334 --> 00:44.747
We should be out there dusting
bad guys, not actually dusting.

00:44.837 --> 00:50.002
I am just trying to scrub away
the wolf who shall not be named.

00:50.092 --> 00:53.755
Aw, honey. Honey,
you're binge cleaning.

00:53.846 --> 00:57.179
Spring cleaning of the heart starts
with spring cleaning of the hearth.

00:57.266 --> 01:00.224
Okay. That should be
in a hurl-mark card.

01:00.311 --> 01:03.269
But, if it's cleaning you need,

01:03.356 --> 01:07.645
you can be Cinderella
and I'll be your little birdie.

01:07.735 --> 01:10.317
Your sacrifice is noted.

01:19.956 --> 01:22.572
Good morning, Mrs. Farlinger.

01:22.667 --> 01:24.623
Paper didn't arrive today?

01:26.003 --> 01:30.793
Yeah. A little brisk out here. You might
want to throw on that extra layer.

01:32.843 --> 01:35.710
Everything all right there, sweetheart?

01:35.805 --> 01:38.592
To sleep, perchance to dream.

01:43.562 --> 01:45.143
Mrs. F?

01:46.482 --> 01:48.063
Mrs. F?

01:49.777 --> 01:51.483
Mrs. F?

01:55.741 --> 01:57.527
Mrs. F?

02:14.135 --> 02:17.047
Life is hard when you
don't know who you are.

02:17.138 --> 02:20.050
It's harder when you
don't know what you are.

02:20.141 --> 02:23.053
My love carries a death sentence.

02:23.144 --> 02:25.226
l was lost for years,

02:25.313 --> 02:27.975
searching, while hiding,

02:28.065 --> 02:32.229
only to find that I belong to
a world hidden from humans.

02:32.320 --> 02:37.189
I won't hide anymore.
I will live the life I choose.

02:46.334 --> 02:49.872
And how is life on the road
with a marching band?

02:49.962 --> 02:52.920
This is the platform to Hogwarts?

02:53.007 --> 02:54.372
Oh, you're joking.

02:54.467 --> 02:56.924
My talents are just completely
wasted on the Fae crowd.

02:57.011 --> 03:01.380
Don't mind Tina Not-Fae here. I'm Bo.

03:01.474 --> 03:04.181
Thanks for coming, Bo, Tina.

03:04.268 --> 03:05.974
What can we do for you, Frank?

03:06.062 --> 03:08.223
| work at the Crawford.

03:08.314 --> 03:10.270
Nice building, good people.

03:10.358 --> 03:13.521
Being a doorman,
it's my human cover, right?

03:13.611 --> 03:16.899
--You're Light Fae?
--Yeah. Basically, it's my territory.

03:16.989 --> 03:20.106
I'm supposed to care for
the folks who live there.

03:20.201 --> 03:23.819
I love those humans. It kills
me to see them all messed up.

03:23.913 --> 03:25.403
How messed up are we talking here?

03:25.498 --> 03:29.207
They've gone insane, all of them.

03:29.293 --> 03:31.705
Mush for brains.

03:31.796 --> 03:33.582
I think it's...

03:35.174 --> 03:40.259
...Dark Fae. Dark Fae feeding in
my territory, hurting my humans.

03:40.346 --> 03:42.507
--So, take it to the Ash.
--I tried.

03:42.598 --> 03:47.388
He said my turf, my problem.
If you ask me, this new Ash...

03:50.022 --> 03:54.311
The new guy doesn't give a
flying Watusi about humans.

03:54.402 --> 03:57.360
But you--they say you have
a real soft spot for them.

03:57.446 --> 03:58.561
You're right.

03:58.656 --> 04:01.648
I don't like the idea of Dark Fae messing
with humans any more than you do.

04:01.742 --> 04:04.449
So, I promise, we'll do what we can.

04:04.537 --> 04:08.450
You have no idea how
much that means to me.

04:08.541 --> 04:11.908
Give me ten and I'll meet you there.

04:12.002 --> 04:14.960
Bo, Tina.

04:16.590 --> 04:20.708
You know, if we ever made any actual
money, we could hire a cleaning lady.

04:20.803 --> 04:22.964
Get our place all waxed and sparkly.

04:23.055 --> 04:26.013
Helping this Frank guy, that'll make me
feel better than cleaning ever could.

04:26.100 --> 04:29.342
But calling Dyson will make you feel
like an ass, oh, Mistress of Masochism.

04:29.437 --> 04:33.680
Relax. Medical mystery? Sounds
like it's right up Lauren's alley.

04:33.774 --> 04:38.143
Hey, the best way to get over someone
is to get under someone else. I get it.

04:38.237 --> 04:39.568
Hey, where you going?

04:39.655 --> 04:42.692
Look, I know you and the good
doctor have some stuff to figure out,

04:42.783 --> 04:48.153
minus this gorgeous, but
unnecessary third wheel. See ya.

04:48.247 --> 04:53.082
Hey. Hey, Lauren. You in the
mood for a house call?

04:53.169 --> 04:58.664
Look, Bo deserves una casa that has
that fresh-from-the-dentist feeling,

04:58.757 --> 05:02.341
but I am not genetically
programmed for housework.

05:02.428 --> 05:03.634
And she doesn't earn enough moolah

05:03.721 --> 05:05.757
to get me the squadron
of maids I deserve.

05:05.848 --> 05:08.339
Well, if you want some spending
money, l'll hire you on for some shifts.

05:08.434 --> 05:12.552
Work for a living?
Do I look like a chump?

05:12.646 --> 05:13.601
Do |?

05:13.689 --> 05:16.522
If I say yes, do I still get that beer?

05:20.863 --> 05:26.733
Hi, there. Couldn't help but
overhear. l'm Mumphert.

05:26.827 --> 05:29.739
I got a shot for that in
kindergarten. Keep walking, pal.

05:29.830 --> 05:32.572
I'm a Brownie. I clean houses.

05:32.666 --> 05:35.328
Before you devour the inhabitants?

05:35.419 --> 05:38.582
I try to stay out of the way.
Mostly, I work at night.

05:38.672 --> 05:42.256
So quiet, you won't
even know I'm there.

05:43.802 --> 05:46.384
And I do it for free.

05:46.472 --> 05:51.341
Mumphey, have a seat.

05:51.435 --> 05:54.051
Psst.

05:54.146 --> 05:57.013
Brownies--perfectly harmless,
or lock up your honeys?

05:57.107 --> 06:00.520
They eat honey, not honeys.
In fact, they like it in their porridge.

06:00.611 --> 06:04.024
What else do they like in their
porridge? Nuggets of girl brain?

06:04.114 --> 06:04.944
No.

06:05.032 --> 06:06.533
A drizzle of virgin blood?

06:06.617 --> 06:08.528
--No.
--Eyeball dumplings?

06:08.619 --> 06:10.450
All they eat is cereal and honey.

06:10.538 --> 06:16.283
Okay, so what you're saying is he is
Trick-certified safe to take home?

06:16.377 --> 06:19.119
Absolutely.

06:19.213 --> 06:21.044
Just don't take him for granted.

06:21.131 --> 06:23.042
Sweet-tacular.

06:23.133 --> 06:26.421
You're hired, kid. Do you
come with your own mop?

06:26.512 --> 06:30.471
Ours kind of got brutalized in a
cheese fondue incident. Not pretty.

06:32.226 --> 06:36.469
I've lost track, is this
vent number 49 or 50?

06:36.564 --> 06:40.307
[LAUREN] Stay sharp and
keep looking for more critters.

06:40.401 --> 06:42.392
I can't believe you made
me catch a cockroach.

06:42.486 --> 06:44.647
Well, I can't believe you screamed.

06:44.738 --> 06:46.990
Sleep. Can't ever sleep.

06:47.074 --> 06:52.660
[LAUREN] Do you want to? Shall I give
you a sedative? No? All righty then.

06:52.746 --> 06:53.656
Any thoughts?

06:53.747 --> 06:57.285
There's no obvious signs
on any of the victims.

06:57.376 --> 07:01.745
I can't tell if it's the work of some
Fae, a new virus, exotic mould.

07:01.839 --> 07:06.299
I won't know anything 'til I run
tests back at the lab. A lot of tests.

07:06.385 --> 07:09.127
Well, thank you...

07:09.221 --> 07:10.336
...for helping.

07:10.431 --> 07:12.592
Always.

07:12.683 --> 07:18.428
So, you haven't mentioned yet.
Do we open the champagne or not?

07:18.522 --> 07:19.637
Over what?

07:19.732 --> 07:25.318
New Ash in, old Ash out. He doesn't
have a hold on you anymore.

07:25.404 --> 07:29.943
So, aren't you...

07:30.034 --> 07:32.491
...you know, free?

07:32.578 --> 07:36.787
No. Like all things Fae, it's...

07:36.874 --> 07:38.034
...it's complicated.

07:38.125 --> 07:40.241
Right.

07:40.336 --> 07:42.327
I promise you, I will
tell you everything--

07:42.421 --> 07:44.503
[screaming]

07:44.590 --> 07:49.710
...just as soon as we're not wading
through a swamp of psychosis.

07:49.803 --> 07:53.216
I'll go find another
vent to play Die Hard in.

07:59.730 --> 08:03.348
Hi, Bo-Bo. Have fun playing doctor?

08:03.442 --> 08:05.558
Six hours swabbing vents.

08:05.653 --> 08:09.817
Five vermin samples captured,
two busted ear drums.

08:09.907 --> 08:12.523
Now I still don't have
one clue in a Fae tree

08:12.618 --> 08:17.533
what caused this mad human
disease. Science is exhausting.

08:17.623 --> 08:19.454
Yeah, but how did it go
about "bow chicka wow wow"?

08:19.541 --> 08:21.532
Kenzi, please. It's strictly professional.

08:21.627 --> 08:24.790
And might I add how yummy Lauren
is when she's being professional?

08:24.880 --> 08:28.168
Mug of hot cocoa to take the edge off?

08:28.258 --> 08:29.964
Go ahead.

08:33.639 --> 08:39.555
And let's just slide those
footsy-wootsies right into Cozyville.

08:39.645 --> 08:42.352
Guess what I brought home?

08:42.439 --> 08:44.725
Confusion and chocolate
dispensing terror?

08:44.817 --> 08:48.810
Bo, this is Mumphert.
He's our new Brownie.

08:48.904 --> 08:54.570
Won't even notice I'm here.

08:54.660 --> 08:55.615
Kenzi.

08:55.703 --> 08:57.785
He is our new live-in help.

08:57.871 --> 09:01.284
And Trick said he's perfectly safe.
I swear on my free bar tab.

09:01.375 --> 09:04.538
You wanted a feng shui
do-over and you got it, sister.

09:04.628 --> 09:06.994
And he's doing it all for free.

09:15.472 --> 09:20.432
[singing]

10:02.436 --> 10:04.222
Surprise.

10:06.523 --> 10:11.358
Pipes were broken at my place.
I didn't think you'd mind.

10:11.445 --> 10:14.437
You just going to stand there or
are you going to come join me?

10:35.010 --> 10:36.716
Turn around.

10:53.862 --> 10:55.568
Ow.

10:59.535 --> 11:02.368
Why are your nails so sharp?

11:02.454 --> 11:07.198
All the better to... rip your heart out!

11:17.970 --> 11:19.426
[KENZI] Bo!

11:33.360 --> 11:35.692
Skinny-bitch cooties.

11:38.740 --> 11:40.355
Bo?

11:40.450 --> 11:44.659
Whatever it was that drove
those humans crazy...

11:44.746 --> 11:47.123
...I think | just found it.

11:53.922 --> 11:56.538
We should have gotten
a Brownie ages ago.

11:56.633 --> 11:59.966
He ironed everything,
including my tankini.

12:00.053 --> 12:02.840
But how are his barista skills?

12:06.143 --> 12:07.849
Yum, yum, yum.

12:11.899 --> 12:17.110
Oh, wow! And might I add--thank god.

12:17.195 --> 12:21.359
Teensy thing. He kind of ate
all the Honey Berry Crunch.

12:21.450 --> 12:23.156
Is that weird?

12:24.912 --> 12:25.947
What?

12:26.038 --> 12:27.903
Not much with the sleeping, huh?

12:27.998 --> 12:29.863
Well, would you be able to
sleep with some crazy lady

12:29.958 --> 12:31.459
waiting to jump on your chest?

12:31.543 --> 12:34.205
Hey, what about me?
I had to walk in and see it.

12:34.296 --> 12:37.880
I swear, she was, like, five seconds
from going reverse cowgirl on you.

12:37.966 --> 12:42.175
Anyway, Mumphert says he didn't
see any more signs of her all night.

12:42.262 --> 12:46.596
Yeah, well, every time | dozed off
I got slammed by nightmares.

12:46.683 --> 12:49.846
It's like she's got her hooks in me.

12:49.937 --> 12:55.728
Well, maybe how you suck people's
faces, she sucks people's brains.

12:55.817 --> 12:58.604
Supen

12:58.695 --> 13:01.687
You stay on top of the
Honey Berry Crunch situation.

13:01.782 --> 13:02.817
--Yes.
--l have to go figure out what I brought

13:02.908 --> 13:06.776
back from Frank's building
and why she's inside my dreams.

13:08.664 --> 13:10.825
Sounds like a Mare.

13:10.916 --> 13:14.750
Well, this filly had only two
legs and tried to ride me.

13:14.836 --> 13:19.205
Different kind of "mare,"
as in nightmare.

13:19.299 --> 13:20.379
Usually Dark Fae.

13:20.467 --> 13:23.209
Mares give humans bad dreams
and feed on the resulting fear.

13:23.303 --> 13:24.543
But I'm not human.

13:24.638 --> 13:29.348
True. And Mare's
aren't usually so toxic.

13:29.434 --> 13:31.345
She rendered an entire
building insane?

13:31.436 --> 13:33.927
Yeah, apparently.

13:34.022 --> 13:36.434
You should stay awake until we
know what we're dealing with.

13:36.525 --> 13:39.187
Mares only feed on those who slumber.

13:39.277 --> 13:41.814
Well, what about the humans?
Can the damage be reversed?

13:45.575 --> 13:48.408
Yes, I can look through my books.

13:50.122 --> 13:51.737
Thank you, Trick.

14:05.929 --> 14:07.635
Another nightmare.

14:07.723 --> 14:15.391
Yeah, it was hunger real bad.
| scarfed a cheeseburger.

14:15.480 --> 14:17.937
|t chewed through my
stomach, then ate my head.

14:18.025 --> 14:23.236
Yum. Your brain is lighting
up when you're asleep.

14:23.321 --> 14:26.609
The overload is probably
what drove the humans insane.

14:26.700 --> 14:30.238
See, look, this area is strobing
even when you're awake.

14:30.328 --> 14:32.489
I think the Mare established
a psychic connection with you

14:32.581 --> 14:34.947
the first time she was on top of you.

14:35.042 --> 14:36.998
Is that why I'm inside her head, too?

14:37.085 --> 14:39.167
You shouldn't be.
Usually, it's a one-way street.

14:39.254 --> 14:42.087
Well, that intense hunger |
just felt, that wasn't mine.

14:42.174 --> 14:43.380
That felt like hers.

14:43.467 --> 14:47.585
That's amazing. It could be that
you're even more powerful and unique

14:47.679 --> 14:51.922
than anyone has ever
given you credit for.

14:52.017 --> 14:57.478
Well, shucks, Doctor.
Oh, wow, not that powerful.

14:57.564 --> 15:01.102
Let me see if I can find
something to keep you awake.

15:06.239 --> 15:10.608
Kiss my couture. Am I dreaming?

15:10.702 --> 15:12.738
We don't only do chores, you know.

15:12.829 --> 15:16.287
Brownies are also
excellent personal shoppers.

15:16.374 --> 15:20.208
How did you even find this?
They only did a limited run.

15:20.295 --> 15:26.916
l have a gift for retail. And by
the way, Brownies never pay.

15:28.095 --> 15:29.380
Are you crying?

15:29.471 --> 15:31.052
I'm sorry.

15:31.139 --> 15:35.553
I'm sorry. You're just the most
wonderful man I've ever met.

15:43.944 --> 15:49.735
Oh. Just one more thing,
I hesitate to mention it...

15:49.825 --> 15:51.656
We're out of Honey Berry Crunch.

15:51.743 --> 15:54.120
Yeah. You ate it all.

15:54.204 --> 15:58.698
Well, next time you're out,
just pick up a few more boxes.

15:58.792 --> 16:01.329
You lug home a truckload
of luxury loot,

16:01.419 --> 16:05.913
but you can't bother to
snag one box of cereal.

16:06.007 --> 16:10.592
Just remember to pick some up.

16:10.679 --> 16:12.590
Somewhere in here,

16:12.681 --> 16:19.143
l have pills from the glands
of a giant Venezuelan wart--

16:19.229 --> 16:21.720
Maybe it's better if you don't know
exactly what you're swallowing.

16:21.815 --> 16:23.521
Yeah.

16:25.902 --> 16:32.444
So, outside of yours truly, I notice the
distinct lack of crazy people screaming.

16:32.534 --> 16:33.444
Uh huh?

16:33.535 --> 16:36.993
You promised me a bedtime story
about you and the Light Fae.

16:37.080 --> 16:39.366
Feels like bedtime to me.

16:39.457 --> 16:43.041
I want to tell you, Bo. I do.

16:45.422 --> 16:49.916
I've wanted to ever since... ever since...

16:52.637 --> 16:54.798
This is a private party.

16:56.266 --> 16:59.758
It's Bo, right? Is that
short for something?

17:04.566 --> 17:05.681
You might remember me as the guy

17:05.775 --> 17:07.857
that's just been crowned
head of the Light Fae.

17:07.944 --> 17:09.195
I remember a preening jackass

17:09.279 --> 17:13.773
prancing around the woods
with a bow and arrow.

17:13.867 --> 17:16.279
I've been asking around about you.

17:16.369 --> 17:19.076
You've a kind of casual approach
to Faedom, haven't you?

17:19.164 --> 17:21.496
Kind of like your approach
to locked doors?

17:21.583 --> 17:26.327
Actually, I'm a bit of a
stickler for protocol.

17:29.174 --> 17:30.334
Get up.

17:30.425 --> 17:33.963
As the new Ash, all the old
Ash's chattel is passed to me.

17:34.054 --> 17:36.887
That means everything from
the lab, including you.

17:36.973 --> 17:39.840
Take her down, then come back
for the rest and help him.

17:43.772 --> 17:46.855
Whatever hand you don't want
to lose, remove from the doctor.

17:46.942 --> 17:50.184
Now, now, now, Bo,
don't be so petulant.

17:50.278 --> 17:55.238
You want access to my
property, make a formal request.

17:55.325 --> 17:58.442
Lauren is no one's property.

17:58.536 --> 18:02.575
Bo, don't. You'll just make it worse.

18:02.666 --> 18:05.533
--No. I'm going to make it right.
--Look at me.

18:05.627 --> 18:10.166
Please, I need you to stay out of this.

18:20.392 --> 18:23.930
Bo, stay awake.

18:35.448 --> 18:37.029
Good times.

18:41.663 --> 18:42.698
I'm awake.

18:42.789 --> 18:45.496
And I'm Kobe Bryant. Drink coffee!

18:45.583 --> 18:48.290
No. It's all I've been drinking.

18:48.378 --> 18:53.418
| just, now l have gut rot and
l have to pee like a racehorse.

18:53.508 --> 18:55.874
I really could have used
those pills from Lauren.

18:55.969 --> 18:57.675
Actually, what you need is a Baku.

18:57.762 --> 19:00.720
Awesome. What's a Baku?

19:00.807 --> 19:03.799
It's a shy Fae. |t eats bad dreams.

19:03.893 --> 19:06.054
And where does baby get Baku?

19:06.146 --> 19:07.636
Did I mention it's shy?

19:07.731 --> 19:09.062
Nervous stomach?

19:09.149 --> 19:13.233
No. A live Baku eats nightmares.

19:13.320 --> 19:16.562
But the pelt of a dead
one wards off disease.

19:16.656 --> 19:20.319
Poor things have been
hunted almost to extinction.

19:20.410 --> 19:22.150
So, where do we find one?

19:22.245 --> 19:24.657
Lauren might have a Baku or
two in her old medical records.

19:24.748 --> 19:28.536
Lachlan came for Lauren.
He called her chattel.

19:28.626 --> 19:29.957
I swear if he touches her--

19:30.045 --> 19:33.708
Bo. l have ears in many places.

19:33.798 --> 19:37.632
When you're Fae, you should
probably use a different expression.

19:37.719 --> 19:41.382
Word in the Ash's compound is
Lauren is being treated with respect.

19:41.473 --> 19:44.806
Yeah, except for the
whole owning thing.

19:44.893 --> 19:51.059
Lachlan's an unknown quantity.
Tread carefully with him. Play nice, Bo.

19:51.149 --> 19:54.687
Yeah. Play nice, Bo.

19:54.778 --> 19:56.518
I'm so tired, Kenzi.

19:56.613 --> 19:59.821
Don't sleep. Wake up,
wake up, wake up.

20:15.673 --> 20:17.538
You waiting for the Ash, too?

20:25.683 --> 20:30.268
Do you mind? One of those magazines.

20:30.355 --> 20:31.845
Of course.

20:42.117 --> 20:43.573
[MAN'S VOICE] Bo.

20:51.918 --> 20:53.499
Bo.

20:55.296 --> 20:57.161
You've got something on your chin.

20:57.257 --> 21:01.125
What? Oh.

21:01.219 --> 21:04.177
[LACH LAN] Late night?

21:04.264 --> 21:07.472
You know what they say
about being a succubus--

21:07.559 --> 21:10.767
it's not the work that'll
kill you, it's the hours.

21:10.854 --> 21:12.890
It's a little of both.

21:12.981 --> 21:18.567
Look at you. I didn't expect
to have the pleasure so soon.

21:18.653 --> 21:25.115
Well, I come to you, oh, great Ash,

21:25.201 --> 21:31.868
especially be-humbled...
Can I just please talk to Lauren?

21:31.958 --> 21:35.075
It's a shame she's
kind of busy right now.

21:35.170 --> 21:36.785
Of course she is.

21:36.880 --> 21:42.295
You know, I gave my men good
odds that you'd never show.

21:42.385 --> 21:43.921
You cost me a thousand dollars,
do you know that?

21:44.012 --> 21:46.719
Well, I'd hate to be predictable.

21:52.979 --> 21:54.640
Seductress.

21:56.232 --> 21:57.847
Warrior.

21:59.194 --> 22:01.276
Fashion refugee.

22:02.655 --> 22:04.816
What are you after with that
contrarian little act of yours?

22:04.908 --> 22:07.991
It's not an act.

22:08.077 --> 22:11.535
Look, this first date
chit-chat is swell and all,

22:11.623 --> 22:14.615
but if I can just have five
minutes with Lauren...

22:14.709 --> 22:17.371
I might if it's in the
interest of the Light Fae.

22:17.462 --> 22:19.669
--It is.
--|s it?

22:19.756 --> 22:25.922
One would think it was the
Ash's job to make that call.

22:26.012 --> 22:29.630
I took on Frank's little problem.

22:29.724 --> 22:30.759
Frank who?

22:30.850 --> 22:36.595
The doorman. He came to
see you, pleading for help.

22:36.689 --> 22:39.431
Don't tell me to keep my nose
out of Light Fae business

22:39.526 --> 22:40.936
because he needed you.

22:41.027 --> 22:43.939
And like the arrogant
self-involved, useless little prick

22:44.030 --> 22:49.866
that I'm starting to get the sense
that you are, you turned him away.

22:49.953 --> 22:56.074
I'm sorry. When I get tired, my
innie thoughts become outies.

23:03.675 --> 23:05.336
No one by the name of Frank,

23:05.426 --> 23:10.671
doorman or otherwise,
has ever spoken to me.

23:17.188 --> 23:20.931
Yeah. My bad.

23:21.025 --> 23:24.062
Like I said, I haven't really been
getting a lot of sleep lately.

23:24.153 --> 23:28.772
So, I'm sorry to bother you.

23:48.469 --> 23:53.759
Mumphert, I think there's
something off with the spaghetti.

23:53.850 --> 23:58.435
Too much... sock?

24:02.859 --> 24:04.440
Mumphert!

24:04.527 --> 24:06.313
Problem, Miss Kenzi?

24:06.404 --> 24:11.364
Dude.

24:11.451 --> 24:13.783
What's with the campaign
of mass annoyance?

24:13.870 --> 24:15.781
Oh, you know what you did!

24:15.872 --> 24:20.832
Okay, clearly someone's last round
of electroshock didn't take.

24:20.918 --> 24:22.658
Thank you for everything,
Mumpherino,

24:22.754 --> 24:26.292
but I think they need
you back in the ward.

24:26.382 --> 24:31.752
You made this my home.
I'm not going anywhere. Ever.

24:31.846 --> 24:33.302
You...

24:39.896 --> 24:42.103
Qu'est—ce que the hell?

25:03.628 --> 25:05.584
Hey, Bo.

25:07.632 --> 25:10.840
--Lab results in already?
--Yeah.

25:10.927 --> 25:13.339
The prognosis is extremely pissed off.

25:13.429 --> 25:15.590
You lied to me, Frank.
You never went to the Ash.

25:15.682 --> 25:17.923
Okay. You're upset.

25:18.017 --> 25:19.678
You think?

25:19.769 --> 25:24.513
The best way to cool down when
you're running so hot is to sleep it off.

25:43.876 --> 25:46.253
Okay, who wants to go see the new
talkie that just opened at the Odeon?

25:46.337 --> 25:47.838
[KENZI] I do! I do!

25:47.922 --> 25:51.460
Everyone is saying it is the
greatest love story ever told.

25:51.551 --> 25:55.260
Guys, don't invite the buzzkill,
okay, she ruins everything.

25:56.639 --> 25:58.971
Okay, let's go.

25:59.058 --> 26:04.269
I don't. I don't. No, I like a good love
story just as much as the next gal.

26:04.355 --> 26:09.145
Guys, wait. Can someone
help me out with a yank?

26:09.235 --> 26:10.816
I can't...

26:13.156 --> 26:15.818
Guys, I'm still here.

26:24.333 --> 26:27.370
Tasty, tasty.

26:40.892 --> 26:43.429
B is for Bo.

27:03.122 --> 27:04.658
Guys...

27:21.724 --> 27:24.215
Don't be mad.

27:24.310 --> 27:28.178
I left mad some time ago.
I'm sailing right into livid.

27:28.272 --> 27:33.767
I had no choice. The circumstances
are just kind of beyond my control.

27:33.861 --> 27:36.603
I'll show you beyond your control.

27:50.962 --> 27:57.003
Say, Frank, you got
a real pretty mouth.

27:57.093 --> 28:00.802
Oh, Mumphert!

28:00.888 --> 28:04.801
Mumphert? Mumphey?

28:07.520 --> 28:11.604
You were gone so long, I thought
you'd abandoned everything.

28:11.691 --> 28:13.101
And everyone.

28:13.192 --> 28:18.437
Mumphydoodles, abandon my
favourite Brownie? Never.

28:18.531 --> 28:23.400
Some people would take money for
what I do. All | ask for is gratitude.

28:23.494 --> 28:29.785
Gratitude? l have so much gratitude,
I can barely keep it down.

28:34.672 --> 28:36.253
Here.

28:39.176 --> 28:40.131
For me?

28:40.219 --> 28:41.425
Yeah.

28:41.512 --> 28:43.844
You didn't need to do this.

28:43.931 --> 28:45.922
Wish that were true.

28:49.770 --> 28:53.479
Mumpty Dumpty, everything copacetic?

28:53.566 --> 28:54.681
It's fantastic.

28:54.775 --> 28:59.360
Good. Good, 'cause, you know,
I don't know if you're up for it yet

28:59.447 --> 29:02.780
and actually I don't even
know if you're capable, but--

29:02.867 --> 29:08.578
No, what? Anything, Miss Kenzi.
It would be my pleasure.

29:08.664 --> 29:12.122
Personal shopping request. Fur.

29:12.209 --> 29:15.997
Ooh, mink coat, fox stole?

29:16.088 --> 29:21.879
Actually, I was thinking a Baku.

29:21.969 --> 29:26.383
Baku pelt. Very rare.

29:26.474 --> 29:30.592
And I would like the Baku still in it.

29:40.029 --> 29:44.523
Talk to me. Start at the top.

29:44.617 --> 29:51.034
I lied. I'm not Light Fae. l'm Dark.

29:51.123 --> 29:53.205
Why did you lie?

29:53.292 --> 29:55.669
This is Light Fae territory.

29:58.172 --> 30:00.458
I'm just squatting.

30:00.549 --> 30:04.667
It's tough times. The recession.

30:04.762 --> 30:08.129
Don't think you're going
to get away with it.

30:08.224 --> 30:15.721
Are you kidding? The Light
Fae are so messed up.

30:15.815 --> 30:18.227
The new Ash, he still
hasn't restored order.

30:18.317 --> 30:20.979
So, why drag me into it?

30:21.070 --> 30:23.356
Connie's so hungry.

30:23.447 --> 30:25.438
Connie? Who's Connie?

30:25.533 --> 30:28.991
My gal. She's ravenous.

30:29.078 --> 30:30.909
The Mare.

30:30.997 --> 30:32.533
Once she finished snacking
on all the humans,

30:32.623 --> 30:36.992
she needed a juicy Fae
for her main course.

30:37.086 --> 30:39.702
So, why not feed on you?

30:39.797 --> 30:47.545
I'm a Sandman. I put people to sleep,
but I don't sleep myself, not ever.

30:47.638 --> 30:51.631
I'm no good to her that way,
as she likes to remind me.

30:51.726 --> 30:53.216
So, you targeted me.

30:53.310 --> 30:58.680
Everyone knows you're
unaligned. You're all alone.

30:58.774 --> 31:05.987
Throw that in my face.
I'm just so sleepy again. Why?

31:06.073 --> 31:10.112
I told you, I'm a Sandman.

31:10.202 --> 31:12.944
| shed my dust like cats shed dander.

31:13.039 --> 31:18.033
|just... |just need
one second to regroup.

31:20.671 --> 31:22.252
Honey pie?

31:27.553 --> 31:31.216
Well, if this doesn't beat all.

31:31.307 --> 31:34.174
Yeah, got a little messed
up here, huh, baby doll?

31:34.268 --> 31:36.133
You were spilling your guts to her.

31:36.228 --> 31:37.343
She's strong.

31:37.438 --> 31:40.396
And a threat.

31:40.483 --> 31:46.900
This... this is the meal
that you choose for me.

31:46.989 --> 31:49.731
Who's the one who knocked back
an entire building of humans?

31:49.825 --> 31:50.780
Talk about blowing our cover!

31:50.868 --> 31:54.110
I am eating for six.

31:54.205 --> 31:56.571
You checked her out with your own eyes.
If you didn't like the succubus,

31:56.665 --> 31:58.201
you didn't have to follow her home.

31:58.292 --> 32:02.956
Moron! In my condition, I should
not have had to follow her home.

32:03.047 --> 32:06.835
Sometimes, I think I would have been
happier shacking up with a Harpie.

32:09.386 --> 32:12.253
Oh, great. Now you woke her.

32:12.348 --> 32:14.339
--Me?
--Get her locked up before she runs off

32:14.433 --> 32:16.594
and brings some real heat down on us.

32:19.730 --> 32:27.694
Don't touch me. Or somebody
pinch me. No, not you.

32:27.780 --> 32:29.361
You.

32:31.075 --> 32:32.611
Easy, Bo.

32:39.083 --> 32:43.042
Bo, easy. Easy.

32:43.129 --> 32:48.669
Oh, my dad was right.
You are such a loser!

33:04.817 --> 33:10.107
I can see it in your eyes,
sweetheart, awake but still dreaming.

33:12.074 --> 33:14.531
Come on, let me take care of you.

33:20.749 --> 33:25.459
Where you going to go, Bo? I got
this place locked up tight, remember?

33:30.342 --> 33:33.584
Yeah.

33:33.679 --> 33:35.886
Oh, crap. Oh, crap.

33:51.697 --> 33:52.607
[cell phone ringing]

33:52.698 --> 33:54.609
Hey, slumber butt,
where you been all day?

33:54.700 --> 33:59.194
Oh, Kenz, I don't know. I don't know
if I'm awake or if I'm dreaming.

33:59.288 --> 34:01.779
Oh, Honey Berry Crunch,
where are you?

34:01.874 --> 34:03.614
I'm at the Crawford.

34:03.709 --> 34:08.294
Oh, Kenzi I don't know. I don't
know what's real anymore.

34:10.174 --> 34:12.881
Bo, you got to hang in, okay?

34:12.968 --> 34:15.345
Look what I found.

34:15.429 --> 34:17.670
Oh, you got one. That's amazing.

34:17.765 --> 34:18.880
Who loves you?

34:18.974 --> 34:23.934
Bo, stay where you are, okay?
I've got you a Baku. We're on our way.

34:40.162 --> 34:43.074
I know where you live, bitch.

34:47.962 --> 34:52.547
lam in your head, too.

34:52.633 --> 34:54.669
B is for basement.

35:26.208 --> 35:29.416
[crying]

35:29.503 --> 35:34.623
Ma'am, are you okay?

35:34.717 --> 35:38.460
I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to bother anyone.

35:44.560 --> 35:45.800
Oh my god.

35:45.894 --> 35:51.105
Look at you. Beautiful.

35:53.152 --> 35:57.111
I never realized I was so beautiful.

35:59.366 --> 36:02.904
What's wrong?

36:02.995 --> 36:09.082
You're the first person
who's come in years.

36:09.168 --> 36:11.659
Well, where is everybody?

36:11.754 --> 36:15.372
Kenzi...

36:15.466 --> 36:22.588
...she died... decades ago.

36:22.681 --> 36:28.096
And then after Dyson,

36:28.187 --> 36:32.396
after Lauren,

36:32.483 --> 36:35.520
I never found love again.

36:35.611 --> 36:37.317
Don't say that.

36:37.404 --> 36:40.567
But you're here now.

36:40.657 --> 36:45.742
Stay with me. It's been so
long since I've been touched.

36:45.829 --> 36:47.490
Since I've had one kiss.

36:47.581 --> 36:49.117
No, please, I have to go. Please.

36:49.208 --> 36:51.073
Just one kiss.

36:58.926 --> 37:01.133
[KENZI] Bo?

37:05.599 --> 37:07.055
Bo.

37:10.104 --> 37:12.686
Okay, so how do you
nosh the bad dreams?

37:12.773 --> 37:16.641
Should I, like, hold her head
while you unhinge her jaw? Or...

37:20.864 --> 37:23.981
Oh, that's nice.

37:54.606 --> 37:56.187
Hey.

38:02.823 --> 38:03.983
Where are you going?

38:04.074 --> 38:05.530
What's it to you?

38:05.617 --> 38:09.610
Bo, I want it back.

38:11.290 --> 38:14.874
--What?
--[DYSON] All of it.

38:14.960 --> 38:17.292
I want to be with you.

38:22.134 --> 38:24.125
But the Norn...

38:28.807 --> 38:31.924
What do you say?

38:32.019 --> 38:37.685
|n here, we can be together, always.

38:40.986 --> 38:42.692
Come on.

38:50.078 --> 38:55.448
I've eaten the scary dreams,
but your friend is stuck.

38:55.542 --> 38:59.251
Someone or something
is holding her there.

38:59.338 --> 39:02.330
Bo. Bo! Bo!

39:02.424 --> 39:03.413
She can't hear you.

39:03.509 --> 39:08.378
Bo. Bo, please come back.
Please come back.

39:24.738 --> 39:29.072
No. And goodbye.

39:49.805 --> 39:56.893
Hi. Bo, meet Baku.

39:56.979 --> 39:58.435
Thank you.

40:00.774 --> 40:02.765
I want in.

40:09.575 --> 40:15.195
If you're still hungry, there are
plenty of humans in the building.

40:15.289 --> 40:18.952
I bet their dreams are pretty bad, too.

40:19.042 --> 40:23.786
Thank you. Thank you.

40:23.880 --> 40:27.464
You feeling awake and not cuckoo?

40:27.551 --> 40:36.050
| wish... Kenzi | feel like the Mare
still has this psychic link to...

40:48.363 --> 40:50.900
I think my water just broke.

40:58.957 --> 41:01.539
She was feeding illegally
in your territory.

41:01.627 --> 41:03.663
Someone had to do your job for you.

41:03.754 --> 41:04.789
What do you want, a medal?

41:04.880 --> 41:08.714
I don't want anything from you.

41:08.800 --> 41:15.171
l have a proposition for
you. Freelance for us.

41:15.265 --> 41:18.257
You won't have to swear allegiance.
Won't be under my rule.

41:18.352 --> 41:20.388
I'll even pay you a retainer.

41:20.479 --> 41:21.559
To do what?

41:21.647 --> 41:27.142
Do the wonderful thing that
you do when the need arises.

41:33.200 --> 41:38.945
No disrespect, but if anything arises,

41:39.039 --> 41:42.156
I'm sure you'll have it well in hand.

41:55.847 --> 41:58.259
Seriously? You're leaving?

41:58.350 --> 42:02.138
You should have seen the
Baku's place. It's a pig sty.

42:02.229 --> 42:05.972
Well, if it's more of a mess
you want, I can be messier.

42:06.066 --> 42:09.479
I'll play paintball in the kitchen.
l'll shave my legs in the living room.

42:09.569 --> 42:13.903
It's over, Kenzi. The Baku
has lived alone for decades.

42:13.990 --> 42:18.529
A complete shut-in.
He needs me more.

42:20.831 --> 42:22.662
Love ya.

42:26.753 --> 42:30.587
Well, send a postcard or whatevs.

42:32.509 --> 42:34.966
Oh, right.

42:40.183 --> 42:41.764
Thank you.

42:48.233 --> 42:52.693
You got everything you need?
Eye mask, ear plugs.

42:52.779 --> 42:55.691
You get as much beauty sleep
as you need, pumpkin, okay?

42:55.782 --> 43:00.822
I will be so quiet tomorrow.
And clean, too.

43:00.912 --> 43:04.450
Just keep being you, Kenz.

43:04.541 --> 43:07.749
Sweet dreams. The sweetest.

43:07.836 --> 43:12.546
Oh, and don't worry. I got this watch.
