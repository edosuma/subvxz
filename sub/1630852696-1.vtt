04:20.962 --> 04:22.429
Hey, honey.

04:22.462 --> 04:23.931
What are you doing up?

04:25.499 --> 04:27.969
Oh, I couldn't sleep.

04:28.002 --> 04:29.871
I don't like the bed.

04:29.904 --> 04:31.338
Well, you better
get used to it,

04:31.371 --> 04:33.074
it's only our first night here.

04:33.107 --> 04:33.875
What about you?

04:35.009 --> 04:35.710
Why are you up?

04:37.344 --> 04:38.780
I couldn't sleep either.

04:38.813 --> 04:40.548
Yeah.

04:40.581 --> 04:42.917
Hey, you were gnawing your
teeth in your sleep again.

04:45.086 --> 04:45.920
Had another episode.

04:51.526 --> 04:53.027
Did you get connected
to the wifi?

04:53.060 --> 04:56.097
No, nothing still,
I'm just looking at old posts.

04:56.130 --> 04:58.065
Oh, I like that one there,
look.

04:58.099 --> 04:59.767
"Has your husband even grieved?

04:59.801 --> 05:01.702
Is he even around?"

05:01.736 --> 05:02.503
Trolls.

05:04.839 --> 05:06.507
Aren't they your friends?

05:06.541 --> 05:08.676
From high school,
like half a lifetime ago.

05:08.709 --> 05:11.378
So what now, they suddenly
all become your therapist?

05:11.411 --> 05:13.981
I know it sounds so
stupid, but if you were

05:14.015 --> 05:16.984
on social media,
you'd understand.

05:17.018 --> 05:19.020
Well, I value my privacy.

05:19.053 --> 05:20.888
It's funny how that makes
me into some kind of maniac.

05:20.922 --> 05:21.989
Close.

05:22.023 --> 05:23.691
You're in construction.

05:23.724 --> 05:26.527
Well, I am a carpenter,
according to my old man.

05:27.795 --> 05:29.030
Yeah.

05:29.063 --> 05:32.700
I forgot, the religious
one in the family.

05:32.733 --> 05:35.069
Listen,
I consider myself social,

05:35.102 --> 05:37.038
just not in a media kind of way.

05:37.071 --> 05:38.739
Do you want me to
go on social media?

05:38.773 --> 05:39.907
I mean, would that help you?

05:45.713 --> 05:47.048
Just forget about it.

05:47.081 --> 05:47.949
I know who you are.

05:51.752 --> 05:52.954
We're here for this.

05:52.987 --> 05:53.754
What?

05:55.556 --> 05:56.356
Just nothing.

05:58.993 --> 06:00.493
Which is exactly
what we're gonna do

06:00.528 --> 06:02.395
the whole time we're here.

06:02.429 --> 06:04.131
We're just gonna
let go of everything.

06:05.600 --> 06:07.001
Okay?

06:07.034 --> 06:08.368
You promised me.

06:12.940 --> 06:13.908
Just breathe.

07:52.006 --> 07:52.673
Trust the harness.

07:52.707 --> 07:53.708
Oh my god!

07:53.741 --> 07:54.542
Too late now!

07:56.043 --> 07:57.878
Woo!

07:57.912 --> 08:00.114
Go, go, go, go!

08:00.147 --> 08:02.750
Ah, go Jay!

08:21.669 --> 08:22.236
Beautiful.

08:23.804 --> 08:24.972
It's so pretty.

08:58.139 --> 08:59.173
Excuse me.

08:59.206 --> 09:00.274
Yes, may I help you?

09:00.307 --> 09:02.043
Hi, was this a prison?

09:02.076 --> 09:03.677
Yes, it is.

09:03.711 --> 09:04.912
Would you like to
hear her story?

09:04.945 --> 09:05.746
Yes.

09:05.780 --> 09:06.647
Yes, please.

09:06.680 --> 09:08.182
Her name was Vo Thi Sau.

09:08.215 --> 09:10.351
She was famous
about her bravery.

09:10.384 --> 09:14.321
At 14 years old, she took arms
against the French soldier.

09:14.355 --> 09:16.757
Wow, a teenage war hero.

09:17.958 --> 09:18.759
That's amazing.

09:18.793 --> 09:19.727
Did she die here?

09:19.760 --> 09:22.663
She was executed in 1952.

09:22.696 --> 09:24.965
Her story is an
inspiration and make her

09:24.999 --> 09:27.234
become a war hero in Vietnam.

09:27.268 --> 09:29.036
It's like Joan of Arc.

09:29.070 --> 09:29.970
Thank you.

09:31.038 --> 09:32.139
For good fortune.

09:53.294 --> 09:54.695
Hello, hello.

10:10.444 --> 10:11.979
Honey?

10:12.012 --> 10:12.980
Hi, Mom.

10:13.013 --> 10:14.115
Hi!

10:14.148 --> 10:15.282
Can you hear me?

10:15.316 --> 10:17.351
Yes, I can hear you.

10:17.384 --> 10:19.353
How are you guys doing?

10:19.386 --> 10:20.921
We're doing great.

10:20.955 --> 10:22.256
Where are you?

10:22.289 --> 10:24.692
At a beachside cafe in town.

10:24.725 --> 10:25.659
You want to see?

10:25.693 --> 10:27.261
Yes, I want to see.

10:27.294 --> 10:29.029
Oh my god.

10:29.063 --> 10:30.297
Is that Kyle?

10:30.331 --> 10:32.333
He's playing soccer
with the waiters.

10:32.366 --> 10:34.835
Uh-huh, yes, baby, I see you.

10:37.338 --> 10:39.740
Such a goof.

10:39.773 --> 10:40.975
Don't they have a job to do?

10:41.008 --> 10:43.043
Well, it's the off season.

10:43.077 --> 10:45.312
There's not a lot of tourists
for them to take care of.

10:45.346 --> 10:46.280
Oh, that's good.

10:46.313 --> 10:48.382
You beat the crowd.

10:48.415 --> 10:49.950
It looks beautiful.

10:49.984 --> 10:51.418
It certainly is.

10:51.452 --> 10:52.920
Good.

10:54.755 --> 10:56.790
Look who's here,
look who went away.

10:56.824 --> 10:58.392
Logan, come
over here, say hi!

10:58.425 --> 11:00.261
Quiet no more.

11:00.294 --> 11:02.196
Hi, Lizzie.

11:02.229 --> 11:03.397
Hey, Sis.

11:03.430 --> 11:05.065
How's Vietnam?

11:05.099 --> 11:09.103
Oh, it's, it's amazing so far.

11:09.136 --> 11:10.738
I went parasailing.

11:10.771 --> 11:11.272
Twice.

11:11.305 --> 11:12.072
Wait, you?

11:12.106 --> 11:13.774
No way.

11:13.807 --> 11:15.442
I know, well, they
offered us a free ride, so.

11:15.476 --> 11:17.478
Oh, it's 'cause
you guys are a hot-ass couple.

11:17.512 --> 11:19.313
That's right,
we are a hot-ass couple.

11:19.346 --> 11:21.081
You guys have been
gone for three days.

11:21.115 --> 11:22.316
I've been worried.

11:22.349 --> 11:24.251
You said you would
call the first day.

11:24.285 --> 11:26.153
I know, Mom.

11:26.187 --> 11:29.857
There's no wifi in the room,
and it's really hard to get.

11:31.258 --> 11:33.060
But did you get the
pictures that I sent you

11:33.093 --> 11:34.728
just now of our hotel?

11:34.762 --> 11:35.930
I did.

11:35.963 --> 11:37.398
- Well, good.
- Wow, it's amazing.

11:37.431 --> 11:39.200
Wait a minute, a
room above the water?

11:39.233 --> 11:40.334
Is that safe?

11:41.435 --> 11:44.338
Well, I hope, I guess.

11:44.371 --> 11:46.407
It costs enough money.

11:46.440 --> 11:48.275
No, why? Didn't you
say it's the low season?

11:50.010 --> 11:52.046
Well, I still have
to watch my wallet.

11:52.079 --> 11:53.781
I don't have a job
when I get home.

11:53.814 --> 11:56.083
As a mother, I approve.

11:56.116 --> 11:58.687
No woman should feel bad about
what you went through, baby.

12:02.489 --> 12:03.891
Absolutely.

12:03.924 --> 12:06.393
Hence, the amazing vacation.

12:06.427 --> 12:08.295
Yeah.

12:08.329 --> 12:10.965
I hope you realize how nice
it is of Kyle to do that?

12:10.998 --> 12:12.800
I feel like most
guys would, you know,

12:12.833 --> 12:15.202
go to happy hour and not plan
a whole vacation to Vietnam.

12:15.236 --> 12:16.337
Yeah.

12:16.370 --> 12:18.272
I was as surprised as you are.

12:20.040 --> 12:21.041
I didn't see it coming.

12:21.075 --> 12:23.177
Well, you guys need it.

12:23.210 --> 12:25.446
It's never a bad decision
to take care of yourself,

12:25.479 --> 12:26.180
or your marriage.

12:28.082 --> 12:30.251
Wait, and no wifi?

12:30.284 --> 12:32.219
I mean, for that price,
you guys should be getting,

12:32.253 --> 12:34.488
at least HBO or something.

12:34.522 --> 12:37.559
That's not the point, Lizzie,
it's a retreat for them.

12:37.592 --> 12:38.859
Just them, by themselves.

12:40.327 --> 12:42.363
I'll take you
here sometime, Mom,

12:42.396 --> 12:44.532
and Lizzie,
it'll be a girls' trip.

12:44.566 --> 12:46.066
Oh, god.

12:46.100 --> 12:47.334
That sounds so good.

12:47.368 --> 12:48.802
Your dad says hello.

12:48.836 --> 12:50.871
He's on his fifth
day of no carbs.

12:50.904 --> 12:52.206
- Really?
- He's horrible.

12:52.239 --> 12:54.341
Now I just need to get
the beer away from him.

12:54.375 --> 12:55.577
Good luck with that!

12:55.610 --> 12:57.111
Yeah.

13:00.214 --> 13:01.148
How are you guys doing?

13:01.181 --> 13:02.483
How is Kyle doing?

13:02.517 --> 13:04.051
He's good.

13:04.084 --> 13:05.219
He's really good.

13:05.252 --> 13:06.820
We're doing really well.

13:06.854 --> 13:07.855
Good.

13:07.888 --> 13:08.422
Honey, it'll be okay.

13:08.455 --> 13:09.390
You need this.

13:11.091 --> 13:12.226
I miss you.

13:12.259 --> 13:13.394
Oh, I miss you too.

13:13.427 --> 13:15.095
You know I love you.

13:15.129 --> 13:16.397
I can't stand this.

13:16.430 --> 13:17.965
Let's get off.

13:17.998 --> 13:19.333
But you guys have fun out there.

13:19.366 --> 13:20.602
Just forget about everything.

13:20.635 --> 13:21.368
- Just...
- Yeah, that's-

13:23.170 --> 13:25.573
That's what Kyle
keeps telling me.

13:25.607 --> 13:27.341
Well, he needs you too, honey.

13:27.374 --> 13:29.143
Come home to me soon, okay?

13:29.176 --> 13:30.512
Get me something fun.

13:30.545 --> 13:32.179
That'll be my
first order of business.

13:32.212 --> 13:33.314
I love you.

13:33.347 --> 13:34.982
Love you, Mom.

13:42.122 --> 13:44.224
- Bye!
- I love you.

13:44.258 --> 13:45.192
Bye, sweetie.

13:45.225 --> 13:45.893
Bye.

14:52.493 --> 14:55.162
Honey, there's no signal here.

14:55.195 --> 14:57.131
That SIM you got
in town is useless.

15:08.008 --> 15:09.644
Oh!

15:09.677 --> 15:11.546
Oh my god, it's great.

15:11.579 --> 15:12.680
I just, I'm trying to
get it on, I can't get on.

15:12.714 --> 15:15.115
Look, I can see all the fish!

15:15.149 --> 15:15.949
So clear.

15:15.983 --> 15:17.418
Honey, honey, hey!

15:17.451 --> 15:18.520
Come on, just get rid of it.

15:18.553 --> 15:19.521
It's not what we're here for.

15:19.554 --> 15:20.588
I just, I need a minute.

15:22.256 --> 15:23.390
Come on.

15:23.424 --> 15:25.426
Please, get in.

15:25.459 --> 15:27.327
Let me help you,
you'll feel totally different.

15:27.361 --> 15:28.462
Come on, we promised
we were just gonna

15:28.495 --> 15:29.930
let go of everything, remember?

15:34.101 --> 15:36.638
Besides, we paid a freakin'
fortune for this floating villa!

15:36.671 --> 15:37.438
Come on.

15:41.408 --> 15:42.409
All right.

15:42.443 --> 15:43.110
Woo!

15:44.679 --> 15:46.280
Hey, get me one too.

15:46.313 --> 15:46.980
Got one.

15:51.452 --> 15:52.386
No, no!

15:52.419 --> 15:53.521
I hate you!

15:53.555 --> 15:54.656
Don't!

15:54.689 --> 15:56.256
I'm gonna get in!

17:12.634 --> 17:13.400
God.

17:14.702 --> 17:17.037
We should've done this sooner.

17:18.706 --> 17:21.208
Ah, fuck, god damnit.

17:41.796 --> 17:42.564
Honey.

17:44.566 --> 17:46.568
I'm so sorry.

17:47.902 --> 17:50.538
You know it's not your fault.

17:50.572 --> 17:52.072
Honey, it's okay.

17:54.174 --> 17:56.310
It's okay, it's not your fault.

17:57.411 --> 17:58.713
It's gonna be okay.

18:00.615 --> 18:01.281
It's okay.

18:05.653 --> 18:07.354
You all right?

18:07.387 --> 18:08.088
Mm-hmm.

18:09.657 --> 18:11.224
It's just an episode.

18:13.460 --> 18:14.127
Oh.

18:15.495 --> 18:17.130
Sorry.

18:17.164 --> 18:18.332
Maybe I shouldn't have
made you get in the water?

18:18.365 --> 18:19.567
Just give me a minute.

18:19.601 --> 18:20.267
Yeah, yeah, of course.

18:29.409 --> 18:30.645
Kind of stings.

18:30.678 --> 18:32.112
We should be wearing flippers.

18:33.280 --> 18:34.849
You know, it's not your fault.

18:34.882 --> 18:36.684
You know, none of it's
your fault, really.

18:36.718 --> 18:38.519
I'm sorry it happened,
I'm really sorry.

18:40.521 --> 18:41.689
You don't have
to blame yourself.

18:44.959 --> 18:47.528
Shouldn't have done it.

18:58.973 --> 19:00.708
He would have died either way.

19:00.742 --> 19:01.876
It's not your fault.

19:01.909 --> 19:03.711
Stop saying that.

19:03.745 --> 19:06.848
I hate it when people
say that, especially you.

19:06.881 --> 19:07.782
Sorry, I'm sorry.

19:09.383 --> 19:11.151
God dammit, all that blood!

19:11.986 --> 19:12.654
What?

19:13.420 --> 19:16.256
Maybe she would have
lived if I hadn't bled.

19:16.289 --> 19:16.858
Honey.

19:17.992 --> 19:19.761
It's not true, come on.

19:19.794 --> 19:21.529
It has nothing to do with
the water birth or the blood.

19:21.562 --> 19:23.163
You came out of it alive.

19:25.399 --> 19:27.234
We did everything we could.

19:27.267 --> 19:30.303
We just, you hemorrhaged,
and then...

19:33.407 --> 19:34.441
The baby didn't
have a heartbeat,

19:34.474 --> 19:36.644
so, she didn't have a chance.

19:40.715 --> 19:43.183
No, it was me!

19:44.619 --> 19:46.420
That's it, I strangled her!

19:48.355 --> 19:49.791
No.

19:49.824 --> 19:52.325
I was being stupid,
I didn't take care of myself!

19:52.359 --> 19:54.529
I wasn't being safe.

19:54.562 --> 19:55.295
That's it.

19:56.631 --> 19:57.431
We failed her.

19:58.966 --> 20:01.201
I don't know, I just don't know.

20:10.477 --> 20:11.278
Baby?

20:13.280 --> 20:15.917
How, how, how, can we...

20:17.719 --> 20:18.786
Nothing.

20:23.958 --> 20:25.593
- Just...
- No.

21:11.338 --> 21:12.573
I can't stay here.

21:17.845 --> 21:20.815
Yeah, this trip, it's
not gonna work out, is it?

21:22.750 --> 21:25.385
I can't control it, I don't
know why, it just happens.

21:25.418 --> 21:27.287
No, no, don't, it's okay.

21:29.624 --> 21:31.092
You don't have to
explain anything, honey.

21:31.125 --> 21:34.929
I mean, from what I saw
today, from how you were,

21:36.898 --> 21:37.565
we're not staying.

21:38.666 --> 21:40.333
Thank you.

21:40.367 --> 21:41.669
We can leave in the morning.

21:41.702 --> 21:43.436
Maybe the hotel will
give us our money back.

21:45.807 --> 21:47.108
Hey, you know, you
don't have to worry.

21:47.141 --> 21:48.943
I mean you can start
posting tomorrow

21:48.976 --> 21:50.011
how great our trip was.

21:55.783 --> 21:57.484
Yeah.

21:57.518 --> 21:58.451
You wanna go to the bar?

22:04.091 --> 22:05.827
Are we gonna be okay?

22:09.864 --> 22:10.531
I love you.

22:11.732 --> 22:12.533
Here.

23:39.854 --> 23:40.922
What was that?

23:44.692 --> 23:46.493
Just the storm.

23:46.527 --> 23:47.862
Should we be worried?

23:49.764 --> 23:51.966
No, no, it's gonna pass
through, it's tropical.

23:51.999 --> 23:53.067
Oh, it's tropical, yeah.

23:54.168 --> 23:56.938
Just go back to sleep.

24:02.043 --> 24:03.144
Hello?

24:09.216 --> 24:10.518
Okay.

24:20.628 --> 24:22.964
They say we can
relocate if we want.

24:22.997 --> 24:24.065
What?

24:24.098 --> 24:25.232
What'd she say about the storm?

24:25.266 --> 24:26.667
That it's normal.

24:26.701 --> 24:28.235
She's just calling
to reassure us.

24:28.269 --> 24:29.036
Wow.

24:31.572 --> 24:33.741
I don't think there's
anything to worry about.

24:33.774 --> 24:35.475
I mean, how do you feel?

24:36.877 --> 24:40.281
Um, well...

24:40.314 --> 24:41.983
Should we move?

24:48.155 --> 24:49.657
Okay.

24:49.690 --> 24:51.092
No, we're okay, thank you.

24:52.259 --> 24:52.927
Okay, good night.

24:55.930 --> 24:58.966
You know, it's,
it's monsoon season.

24:59.000 --> 25:01.035
I'm sure the hotel has
protocols and procedures

25:01.068 --> 25:02.603
in place for this kind of thing.

25:02.636 --> 25:03.771
Okay.

25:35.202 --> 25:36.904
Kyle, wake up!

25:36.937 --> 25:39.673
Oh my god.

25:47.982 --> 25:48.783
Kyle.

25:52.319 --> 25:54.021
Hey!

25:57.224 --> 25:58.559
Oh, my leg.

26:03.931 --> 26:05.232
I can't.

26:05.266 --> 26:08.836
Get to the phone, call
someone.

26:08.869 --> 26:10.104
Okay.

26:22.283 --> 26:24.351
There's no dial tone.

26:24.385 --> 26:25.753
Dammit.

26:25.786 --> 26:26.787
It's dead. It's dead.

26:26.821 --> 26:27.755
I think I broke my leg.

26:27.788 --> 26:29.056
What? You broke your leg?

26:52.146 --> 26:53.080
Honey?

26:55.382 --> 26:56.183
Honey.

26:56.217 --> 26:58.052
Honey.

26:58.085 --> 26:58.752
Honey.

27:00.454 --> 27:02.156
Honey, wake up!

27:02.189 --> 27:02.990
Honey!

27:04.125 --> 27:05.092
Talk to me.

27:05.126 --> 27:05.893
Hey.

27:07.828 --> 27:08.395
Honey?

27:13.968 --> 27:14.635
Honey.

27:16.370 --> 27:17.204
Talk to me!

27:24.845 --> 27:25.846
Hey, talk to me!

27:29.250 --> 27:30.151
Oh my god.

27:30.184 --> 27:31.185
What?

27:31.218 --> 27:32.386
What is it?

27:32.419 --> 27:34.922
Kyle, we're moving
away from land.

27:49.904 --> 27:52.306
Fuck!

27:52.339 --> 27:53.140
Honey?

27:53.174 --> 27:53.974
Are you okay?

27:54.008 --> 27:54.675
God!

27:57.178 --> 27:58.746
- God Dammit.
- Okay, okay.

28:00.381 --> 28:01.448
Hello, is anyone there?

28:01.482 --> 28:03.350
Do you see anyone?

28:03.384 --> 28:06.787
Babe, I see someone, I think,
I think they're here for us.

28:11.959 --> 28:12.993
Help!

28:13.027 --> 28:15.162
Please, over here, we're here!

28:15.196 --> 28:16.197
Help!

28:16.230 --> 28:17.431
Please!

28:17.464 --> 28:19.266
Help, over here!

28:22.269 --> 28:23.370
Help!

28:23.404 --> 28:24.405
Help!

28:24.438 --> 28:26.207
- Hey!
- What?

28:26.240 --> 28:27.841
We have to swim over to them,
we have to get off this thing.

28:27.875 --> 28:29.210
- No.
- We're gonna lose them.

28:29.243 --> 28:30.444
Do they even know that
we're still out here?

28:30.477 --> 28:32.179
I don't know what to do.

28:33.548 --> 28:35.282
I don't know what to do.

28:36.483 --> 28:37.818
We gotta try.

28:37.851 --> 28:38.886
- No.
- Listen.

28:38.919 --> 28:40.187
I don't think we can make it.

28:40.221 --> 28:41.155
It's gonna be okay,
we just have to try.

28:41.188 --> 28:42.389
It's okay.

28:42.423 --> 28:44.258
No, you can't
make it, your leg!

28:44.291 --> 28:46.193
Listen, I'm fine, I'm
gonna be okay, all right?

28:46.227 --> 28:47.228
We have to try.

28:47.261 --> 28:48.462
We have to, baby.

28:48.495 --> 28:49.763
We have to.

28:49.797 --> 28:50.998
I can't do it!

28:51.031 --> 28:51.966
Hey, trust me.

28:51.999 --> 28:54.335
It's gonna be fine.

28:54.368 --> 28:56.203
Hey, look.

28:56.237 --> 28:57.972
Hey!

28:58.005 --> 28:58.739
Hey!

29:00.040 --> 29:00.874
Hey!

29:04.878 --> 29:05.879
- Okay.
- Okay.

29:05.913 --> 29:07.281
Here we go.

29:07.314 --> 29:08.115
Careful.

29:08.148 --> 29:08.916
Honey.

29:10.217 --> 29:11.318
Come on, come on!

29:15.590 --> 29:16.924
Jay!

29:20.494 --> 29:22.363
Hold on, hold on.

29:22.396 --> 29:23.163
I got you.

29:24.599 --> 29:25.432
Hey!

29:27.868 --> 29:29.236
Help!

29:29.270 --> 29:30.304
Hey!

29:30.337 --> 29:32.106
Kyle, I'm slipping!

29:33.240 --> 29:33.907
Oh my god.

29:42.182 --> 29:42.950
Come on!

29:54.261 --> 29:55.429
Oh shit.

29:55.462 --> 29:57.064
Honey, I love you.

29:57.097 --> 29:58.533
Trust me.

30:07.941 --> 30:09.009
Kyle, Kyle.

30:22.156 --> 30:22.823
Kyle.

30:25.359 --> 30:26.126
Kyle?

30:29.129 --> 30:30.064
Kyle!

30:31.165 --> 30:32.399
Hey, hey.

30:32.433 --> 30:33.100
- Hey.
- Thank god.

30:36.036 --> 30:36.837
You made it.

30:39.239 --> 30:40.007
Okay.

30:43.243 --> 30:45.079
Oh, you're bleeding.

30:45.112 --> 30:46.413
Don't look at it.

30:46.447 --> 30:47.247
Don't...

30:49.950 --> 30:50.484
- Oh.
- Don't look.

30:53.354 --> 30:54.021
Look.

30:55.422 --> 30:56.558
What are we gonna do?

31:00.562 --> 31:03.097
I think that we have
to wait this one out.

31:03.130 --> 31:04.498
They'll come for us, right?

31:05.999 --> 31:09.336
Maybe they'll wait
till the morning.

31:09.370 --> 31:12.439
All we gotta do is we gotta
to stay afloat on this thing.

31:12.473 --> 31:14.642
But that's not until tomorrow.

31:14.676 --> 31:18.011
We can climb these rocks
and we'll send a signal,

31:18.045 --> 31:19.614
the rescue crew has
gotta be around here.

31:19.647 --> 31:20.881
The storm's too strong.

31:22.316 --> 31:24.619
And I can't do that with my leg.

31:24.652 --> 31:26.053
No, I'll do it.

31:26.086 --> 31:26.954
No, I'll go.

31:26.987 --> 31:27.921
No!

31:27.955 --> 31:29.490
You saw how...

31:29.524 --> 31:30.625
You saw me today on the reef.

31:30.658 --> 31:32.092
You saw how risky it was.

31:32.126 --> 31:33.360
I don't even know
how far away we are.

31:33.394 --> 31:35.095
I mean, I can't even
see them anymore.

31:35.129 --> 31:37.665
Listen, we have to stay put.

31:38.966 --> 31:40.467
We're grounded, okay?

31:40.502 --> 31:41.969
Okay.

31:42.002 --> 31:43.538
They'll see us in the morning.

31:43.571 --> 31:44.338
Okay.

31:45.540 --> 31:46.641
What do I do about that?

31:46.674 --> 31:47.575
You gotta get me a towel.

31:47.609 --> 31:48.442
Okay.

31:50.512 --> 31:52.446
Oh, okay, this?

31:52.479 --> 31:53.581
Okay, okay, okay.

31:53.615 --> 31:54.481
Right on it.

31:54.516 --> 31:55.717
Yep.

31:55.750 --> 31:57.985
- Is that good?
- Keep, keep pressure.

31:58.018 --> 31:59.587
- It got worse.
- Yeah.

31:59.621 --> 32:02.022
Yeah, when you were underwater,
I caught myself in that opening.

32:06.126 --> 32:07.127
- Yeah.
- Here.

32:08.563 --> 32:09.564
- Here, wrap that around it.
- Okay.

32:09.597 --> 32:10.998
Okay, tie it tight.

32:14.468 --> 32:16.003
Sorry.

32:16.036 --> 32:17.404
That hurt more
than I thought I did.

32:17.438 --> 32:19.039
Yeah.

32:19.072 --> 32:20.374
Okay, let's get
you comfortable.

32:26.113 --> 32:27.615
I'm getting a
discount on this room.

33:07.555 --> 33:09.089
Oh my god.

33:09.122 --> 33:10.157
Honey!

33:10.190 --> 33:11.158
Wake up!

33:11.191 --> 33:12.259
Wake up!

33:12.292 --> 33:13.260
Honey, wake up!

33:14.729 --> 33:16.531
Here, look, wake up.

33:36.316 --> 33:37.685
Fuck.

33:37.719 --> 33:38.653
We could be anywhere.

33:38.686 --> 33:40.387
What are we gonna do?

33:41.789 --> 33:43.658
I don't know.

33:43.691 --> 33:45.192
No, we couldn't have
drifted that far.

33:52.332 --> 33:55.135
We should've
gotten on the rock!

33:55.168 --> 33:57.337
They were right there,
they could have seen us!

33:57.371 --> 33:59.641
The storm was too strong,
we could have been killed.

33:59.674 --> 34:01.275
I could have done it.

34:01.308 --> 34:03.845
They were there,
the rescue was right there!

34:03.878 --> 34:05.379
Honey, I understand.

34:05.412 --> 34:06.614
I understand what you're saying.

34:06.648 --> 34:08.115
It was too dangerous.

34:08.148 --> 34:10.350
Maybe for you, but I
could have gone for us.

34:10.384 --> 34:12.219
You were hanging off
the side of the house.

34:12.252 --> 34:13.453
Do you remember going
underneath the house?

34:13.487 --> 34:14.722
And who put me down there!

34:14.756 --> 34:16.490
Jay, that's, that's ridiculous!

34:16.524 --> 34:18.760
I can't believe it,
we always do it your way,

34:18.793 --> 34:20.695
it's always your way!

34:20.728 --> 34:21.495
Stop!

34:21.529 --> 34:22.329
Stop it.

34:22.362 --> 34:23.731
I need to focus.

34:33.775 --> 34:37.144
Oh!

34:37.177 --> 34:39.379
Fuck.

34:39.413 --> 34:41.348
Here, just help,
move me away from the water.

34:44.318 --> 34:46.521
I got it. I got it.

34:48.488 --> 34:49.156
Okay.

34:55.262 --> 34:57.230
Just give me a
second to breathe.

35:06.541 --> 35:08.208
Okay.

35:08.241 --> 35:08.810
Okay.

35:11.178 --> 35:12.847
We need to keep
our heads about us.

35:12.880 --> 35:15.315
We need to focus on surviving.

35:15.349 --> 35:15.883
Okay?

35:18.720 --> 35:20.153
Jay, honey.

35:22.456 --> 35:23.791
We're still drifting.

35:26.259 --> 35:28.796
Yeah, probably,
slowly, yeah.

35:28.830 --> 35:31.566
We could be getting
further away by the minute.

35:31.599 --> 35:33.166
It's true, but we could
also be headed back to land.

35:33.200 --> 35:35.670
I just wanna try to get back.

35:36.938 --> 35:38.573
Okay, okay.

35:38.606 --> 35:40.340
I agree with you.

35:40.374 --> 35:43.410
But I mean, where do we go,
which way do you want to swim?

35:43.443 --> 35:45.345
Which direction would we go?

35:45.379 --> 35:47.749
Let's just focus on surviving.

35:47.782 --> 35:49.784
We have to get
everything we can use.

35:49.817 --> 35:51.686
You just stay put.

35:51.719 --> 35:52.520
I'll do it.

35:58.258 --> 36:00.728
Honey, just gather what we need.

36:00.762 --> 36:04.297
Look for water, blankets,
dry pillows, food.

36:06.333 --> 36:06.934
I'll do it.

36:13.908 --> 36:14.809
Okay?

36:15.843 --> 36:16.944
Just gather things up.

36:16.978 --> 36:18.478
Get anything you can.

37:02.757 --> 37:03.991
Water!

37:04.025 --> 37:04.892
More water!

37:37.825 --> 37:38.626
Come on.

38:53.868 --> 38:55.636
Ah.

38:55.670 --> 38:56.336
Nice.

38:58.840 --> 38:59.607
Yeah.

39:01.709 --> 39:03.110
- Here.
- You go.

39:03.144 --> 39:05.012
It's okay, you have it.

39:12.820 --> 39:13.688
We'll have to conserve.

39:18.125 --> 39:18.893
Phone.

39:21.929 --> 39:24.131
Can you come pick up our bags?

39:28.035 --> 39:28.903
- Honey?
- Mm-hmm.

39:28.936 --> 39:30.171
What's wrong?

39:30.204 --> 39:34.008
Swarm of fish scared
the shit out of me.

39:34.041 --> 39:35.810
The shark bastards.

39:35.843 --> 39:37.444
Oh.

39:37.477 --> 39:38.478
You didn't happen to
catch one of them, did ya?

39:39.614 --> 39:41.682
I could use a little sushi.

39:41.716 --> 39:43.885
I was too scared
to think about sushi.

39:43.918 --> 39:46.053
You know what, if it's
not yellowtail, forget it.

39:55.963 --> 39:56.697
They'll come for us.

39:59.000 --> 40:01.002
The raft is really big,
and it's very visible.

40:01.035 --> 40:02.169
So, they'll see us.

40:05.740 --> 40:06.908
We don't know where we are.

40:08.576 --> 40:09.877
What if another storm comes?

40:12.680 --> 40:14.715
How long can we
last in all this?

40:14.749 --> 40:16.050
Alive now.

40:16.083 --> 40:16.817
That's what matters.

40:19.053 --> 40:22.757
So much for the
fancy water villa, huh?

40:22.790 --> 40:26.661
You had to go fancy
and impress the wife.

40:26.694 --> 40:28.663
I'm not impressed.

40:28.696 --> 40:31.666
It only matters if I live
to tell someone about it.

41:07.268 --> 41:08.769
Ow!

41:08.803 --> 41:11.138
- What is it?
- Shit.

41:11.172 --> 41:12.673
- Ah.
- What is it?

41:12.707 --> 41:14.241
I just, I just got burnt.

41:14.275 --> 41:16.010
- What?
- Yeah.

41:16.043 --> 41:16.944
Ah.

41:16.978 --> 41:17.778
You smell that?

41:20.247 --> 41:21.816
Smells like burnt hair.

41:21.849 --> 41:23.117
Yeah.

41:23.150 --> 41:23.918
Burnt the hair on the
inside of my thigh.

41:27.088 --> 41:29.290
What the hell!

41:29.323 --> 41:32.126
Yeah, just scorched my balls.

41:32.159 --> 41:33.594
Well, you gotta
keep it near you.

41:35.029 --> 41:36.030
Just want to keep
it off my nuts.

41:36.063 --> 41:37.231
Here.

41:37.264 --> 41:38.666
You want it on my thigh now?

41:57.184 --> 41:57.952
Wake up.

42:07.028 --> 42:08.796
Hey, over here!

42:08.829 --> 42:09.964
Hey!

42:21.108 --> 42:22.877
Hey, over here!

42:22.910 --> 42:24.311
Over here!

42:24.345 --> 42:26.047
Hey!

42:26.080 --> 42:27.114
Over here!

42:27.148 --> 42:28.082
- They're too far away.
- Huh?

42:28.115 --> 42:29.583
Too far away.

42:31.085 --> 42:32.319
We have to try.

42:32.353 --> 42:34.321
If I can see them,
they can see us!

42:40.795 --> 42:42.296
- Smoke.
- What?

42:42.329 --> 42:43.597
- Smoke.
- The bottle.

42:43.631 --> 42:44.865
- The bottle, yes.
- Yeah.

42:44.899 --> 42:46.133
Is that enough water?

42:46.167 --> 42:48.169
Just drink it baby,
you need it.

42:48.202 --> 42:49.637
C'mon, drink it up.

42:49.670 --> 42:50.905
I'm gonna fill it
up with salt water.

42:50.938 --> 42:51.705
Come on.

42:52.973 --> 42:53.908
Yes, okay.

43:03.250 --> 43:04.351
Okay, here, do it, come on.

43:07.354 --> 43:10.024
I just need something.

43:10.057 --> 43:12.359
Find dry things, dry
things, anything dry.

43:13.828 --> 43:15.329
Here's paper.

43:15.362 --> 43:16.630
Okay.

43:16.664 --> 43:17.598
- No, it's too wet.
- Too wet.

43:23.904 --> 43:24.371
All right.

43:28.676 --> 43:29.076
What?

43:29.110 --> 43:30.044
Do it!

43:31.178 --> 43:31.979
- No.
- Hurry.

43:34.815 --> 43:35.883
Fuck.

43:35.916 --> 43:37.351
- Oh, fuck.
- What?

43:37.384 --> 43:38.285
The sun's too low.

43:38.319 --> 43:39.753
- No!
- It's too low.

43:39.787 --> 43:40.888
- Try it again!
- The sun's too low.

43:40.921 --> 43:42.223
No!

43:42.256 --> 43:44.024
- Do it, honey, go, try again!
- It's too low.

43:44.058 --> 43:45.626
Oh, god.

43:48.095 --> 43:49.163
Hey!

43:49.196 --> 43:50.331
Help!

43:50.364 --> 43:51.866
Help!

43:56.837 --> 43:58.405
Help!

44:00.241 --> 44:02.409
Help!

44:03.177 --> 44:04.979
Help!

44:09.183 --> 44:10.718
Please.

44:10.751 --> 44:12.253
We're right here.

44:13.787 --> 44:16.323
They're gone, they're gone.

45:55.356 --> 45:57.124
Honey, honey.

45:57.157 --> 45:58.425
Honey.

46:03.063 --> 46:05.032
Come on, come here.

46:05.065 --> 46:06.267
Drink this.

46:06.300 --> 46:08.068
Please drink this.

46:08.102 --> 46:10.538
There's not much,
but just drink it.

46:12.906 --> 46:13.541
Kyle.

46:28.188 --> 46:29.189
Oh my god.

46:29.223 --> 46:30.190
Oh my god.

46:30.224 --> 46:30.991
Oh my god.

46:33.394 --> 46:34.795
Over here!

46:35.597 --> 46:37.898
Over here!

46:39.466 --> 46:40.234
Over here.

46:43.270 --> 46:46.574
Over here!

47:10.532 --> 47:12.132
Honey.

47:12.166 --> 47:14.868
- Use the newspaper.
- Ok, yeah.

47:14.902 --> 47:16.470
Oh, baby.

47:16.504 --> 47:18.872
The newspaper, yes.

47:25.412 --> 47:26.980
- No, like-
- You got it?

47:27.014 --> 47:28.215
- I got it.
- Okay.

47:34.054 --> 47:37.592
Over here!

47:37.625 --> 47:38.292
Over here!

47:38.325 --> 47:39.059
Over here!

48:06.588 --> 48:07.388
Over here!

48:07.421 --> 48:08.188
Over here!

48:09.289 --> 48:10.057
Over here!

48:11.458 --> 48:12.192
Over here!

48:13.260 --> 48:14.294
Over here!

48:15.597 --> 48:16.964
- Over here.
- Hey.

48:16.997 --> 48:18.098
There's smoke.

48:23.070 --> 48:28.075
It's working,
it's working, it's working.

48:28.108 --> 48:30.545
Get it.

48:34.616 --> 48:36.016
No!

48:36.049 --> 48:37.317
No!

48:37.351 --> 48:38.653
They're going away!

48:40.320 --> 48:41.388
Baby, more!

48:41.422 --> 48:42.624
More!

48:42.657 --> 48:44.258
More, more, everything.

48:44.291 --> 48:46.226
Just put everything on them now!

48:46.260 --> 48:48.162
We're going to lose them.

48:51.432 --> 48:53.300
They're gonna see us,
they're gonna see.

48:53.333 --> 48:54.134
Help!

48:56.003 --> 48:56.738
Fuck.

48:56.771 --> 48:57.639
Hey, honey.

49:02.644 --> 49:03.711
No.

49:03.745 --> 49:04.411
Jay!

49:05.513 --> 49:06.480
Get outta here!

49:08.048 --> 49:09.049
Fuck!

49:15.389 --> 49:17.124
Come out, come out.

49:17.157 --> 49:17.725
Come out.

49:19.794 --> 49:21.361
Get outta there.

50:38.238 --> 50:39.306
What was that?

50:41.108 --> 50:42.376
What?

50:42.409 --> 50:44.344
I just saw something jump up.

50:57.324 --> 50:58.358
There it is again.

51:05.365 --> 51:07.401
I think maybe it's
just the current.

51:11.471 --> 51:13.373
No, it's a shark.

51:13.407 --> 51:14.474
It's a shark.

51:14.509 --> 51:16.076
Your leg, the blood!

51:21.549 --> 51:23.483
Let me, let me check, okay?

51:23.518 --> 51:24.384
The blood!

51:54.448 --> 51:55.650
Shark, I see it, I see it.

51:55.683 --> 51:57.417
Okay, we have to
get out of the water.

52:00.220 --> 52:02.824
Wait, over there there's
a board, can you make it?

52:02.857 --> 52:03.858
- Come on.
- Yeah.

52:03.891 --> 52:05.192
Come on.

52:05.225 --> 52:05.827
Come on!

52:05.860 --> 52:07.227
Come on.

52:12.667 --> 52:13.768
Swim, baby.

52:13.801 --> 52:15.369
Hurry, hurry.

52:26.446 --> 52:27.247
I saw it!

52:29.751 --> 52:30.918
Okay.

52:30.952 --> 52:31.819
Hurry.

52:31.853 --> 52:34.555
Come on.

52:34.589 --> 52:36.691
We have to get to that raft.

52:36.724 --> 52:38.458
Just stay still,
I'm gonna paddle.

52:39.927 --> 52:41.495
I gotta get my leg
out of the water.

52:42.964 --> 52:44.732
Oh, your leg.

52:44.766 --> 52:46.801
Gotta stay on.

52:49.436 --> 52:50.203
Sharks.

52:52.740 --> 52:53.473
Oh my god.

52:54.842 --> 52:57.244
We have to get to that raft!

52:57.277 --> 53:00.414
Stay still, baby,
I'm gonna paddle us over.

53:00.447 --> 53:01.281
Okay.

53:08.523 --> 53:09.691
Okay.

53:09.724 --> 53:11.391
Come here, come here.

53:19.499 --> 53:20.501
The other way.

53:21.703 --> 53:22.469
Come on.

53:47.595 --> 53:49.864
I fuckin' hate dolphins.

54:34.041 --> 54:35.710
Ow, ow.

54:35.743 --> 54:37.845
It'll be here if you need it.

54:48.589 --> 54:49.724
This is it for us, isn't it?

54:51.491 --> 54:52.359
No one's coming.

54:55.930 --> 54:57.999
You know, people
survive for months at sea.

54:59.834 --> 55:01.569
They only say that 'cause
they live to tell it.

55:03.838 --> 55:06.073
Well, this is not our fate.

55:06.107 --> 55:06.874
So.

55:09.710 --> 55:10.611
We're gonna make it.

55:13.147 --> 55:15.616
Just like, just like
all the other times.

55:16.918 --> 55:18.085
I'm sorry, I can't.

55:19.554 --> 55:20.955
You hate apologies, remember?

55:23.958 --> 55:27.128
I dragged us into this hell.

55:27.161 --> 55:30.097
We would never have been here
if it wasn't for my dread.

55:30.131 --> 55:30.898
No.

55:36.137 --> 55:38.405
I could have done things better.

55:38.438 --> 55:42.442
I just, I could have been
more patient with your PTSD.

55:44.645 --> 55:47.648
And I shouldn't have left
you alone in your misery.

55:52.086 --> 55:53.688
I never should've
mentioned divorce.

55:56.591 --> 55:59.026
I just, I could've
done it better.

56:01.996 --> 56:04.832
I could've wanted,
but it doesn't matter.

56:04.866 --> 56:06.901
It doesn't matter.

56:06.934 --> 56:08.903
Because we brought
each other out here.

56:22.216 --> 56:23.684
Maybe this is our fate.

56:25.653 --> 56:28.556
Childless and die young.

56:28.589 --> 56:30.524
It's kinda cool,
it's like a rockstar fate.

56:32.627 --> 56:34.095
There's gonna be
concerts in your name.

56:36.697 --> 56:38.498
Fuckin' Flotel.

56:38.532 --> 56:39.901
We're like the unluckiest
couple in the world.

56:43.704 --> 56:44.505
Oh, honey.

56:46.774 --> 56:48.809
- Careful.
- We're not gonna...

56:55.116 --> 56:56.751
Listen to me.

56:56.784 --> 56:59.020
We're not gonna die.

56:59.053 --> 57:00.655
We're not gonna die.

57:10.031 --> 57:12.633
Do you remember Carl's wedding?

57:12.667 --> 57:14.602
And I saw you a week
later at that dog park.

57:15.770 --> 57:17.071
You had that, that Pitbull.

57:19.240 --> 57:19.907
He was so cute.

57:21.108 --> 57:23.210
You had that
ridiculous picture.

57:25.079 --> 57:25.746
Oh.

57:27.148 --> 57:28.883
We're gonna be okay.

57:28.916 --> 57:29.884
Okay?

57:29.917 --> 57:31.252
I don't want you to worry.

57:31.285 --> 57:32.653
We're gonna be fine.

57:32.687 --> 57:33.754
We're gonna make it.

57:35.623 --> 57:37.191
You're the best thing
that ever happened to me.

57:37.224 --> 57:39.727
- Yeah?
- You know that?

57:39.760 --> 57:42.730
You're like my best friend.

57:43.264 --> 57:44.031
My wife.

57:47.001 --> 57:48.135
You're more than I'll ever have.

57:55.543 --> 57:56.911
We're gonna be okay.

57:58.245 --> 58:00.147
We're gonna be okay, baby.

58:01.615 --> 58:02.249
You promise?

58:05.786 --> 58:07.788
I promise.

58:21.268 --> 58:22.737
I promise.

59:06.380 --> 59:07.681
Baby?

59:07.715 --> 59:09.884
Honey, are you okay?

59:26.233 --> 59:29.170
Oh, fuck you!

1:00:14.381 --> 1:00:15.182
Kyle!

1:00:19.320 --> 1:00:20.121
Kyle.

1:00:20.154 --> 1:00:20.921
Kyle!

1:00:30.131 --> 1:00:31.365
You have to get
out of the water!

1:00:32.833 --> 1:00:34.935
You have to get
out of the water!

1:00:36.270 --> 1:00:38.172
It's okay, I can't move, okay?

1:00:38.205 --> 1:00:39.673
Just go!

1:00:39.707 --> 1:00:41.675
Go, paddle, go, get your paddle!

1:00:41.709 --> 1:00:43.844
Hurry, hurry, oh god!

1:00:43.878 --> 1:00:44.345
Oh god!

1:02:18.205 --> 1:02:19.039
Honey, honey.

1:02:20.341 --> 1:02:21.475
Honey, wake up!

1:02:21.509 --> 1:02:22.510
There's land.

1:02:22.544 --> 1:02:24.044
There's land, baby!

1:02:32.152 --> 1:02:33.387
No, baby!

1:02:33.420 --> 1:02:34.221
No.

1:02:34.255 --> 1:02:35.089
No.

1:02:35.122 --> 1:02:36.357
Come on.

1:02:36.390 --> 1:02:37.358
