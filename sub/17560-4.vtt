WEBVTT

00:04.921 --> 00:06.339
Honey, we're engaged now.

00:06.423 --> 00:08.090
I really think you should
let me start keeping

00:08.173 --> 00:10.343
some of my stuff here.

00:10.427 --> 00:12.554
Hey, Val,
I got us some coffees.

00:12.637 --> 00:15.473
Whoa, somebody needs a wax.

00:16.725 --> 00:18.184
You're supposed
to be at NYU.

00:18.268 --> 00:20.729
And you're supposed to have
blond hair and boobies.

00:22.897 --> 00:25.942
Oh, Holly, you're not
supposed to be here.

00:26.025 --> 00:28.695
Uh.. Honey, why don't
you go upstairs

00:28.778 --> 00:31.740
and change
into your man clothes?

00:31.823 --> 00:34.617
But the silk,
it makes me feel so pretty.

00:34.701 --> 00:37.036
Okay, who's the greatest
maid of honor ever?

00:37.120 --> 00:37.996
You.

00:38.079 --> 00:39.122
I just found a mistake

00:39.205 --> 00:40.373
in the seating chart
for your wedding

00:40.457 --> 00:41.583
but don't worry.
I'm gonna fix it.

00:41.666 --> 00:43.209
- I'm sorry. What?
- Yeah.

00:43.293 --> 00:44.711
You forgot to put me
and Ben at the same table.

00:44.794 --> 00:47.297
No problemo.
I just did a little rearrange.

00:47.380 --> 00:50.508
No! No, no, no, no, no.
You cannot do that.

00:50.592 --> 00:53.178
No, this took weeks of planning.
Everything is in ink.

00:53.261 --> 00:55.472
White-out.

00:55.555 --> 00:57.724
Look, there's room for me
next to Ben

00:57.807 --> 01:00.185
if I just move Aunt Ellen's
friend Sue to this table.

01:00.268 --> 01:02.187
No, you cannot move
Aunt Ellen's friend.

01:02.270 --> 01:03.354
Why not?

01:03.438 --> 01:05.440
Because that's her
special friend.

01:05.522 --> 01:07.609
Like Special Olympics?

01:08.902 --> 01:11.237
No, like Lesbian Olympics.

01:13.406 --> 01:15.074
Okay, so just add another chair
to the head table

01:15.158 --> 01:16.451
and Ben can sit
next to me there.

01:16.534 --> 01:17.494
No, the head table

01:17.577 --> 01:19.204
is for the wedding party only

01:19.287 --> 01:21.164
not some foreign boy
you picked up in a bar.

01:21.247 --> 01:24.292
Okay, that foreign boy is my
boyfriend, and if he can't--

01:24.375 --> 01:27.545
Girls, girls, girls,
I did not like

01:27.629 --> 01:30.340
what I was hearing when
I was listening at the door.

01:30.423 --> 01:32.008
Now, before it gets ugly

01:32.091 --> 01:34.052
I just want you to know
that I am willing to step in

01:34.135 --> 01:36.346
as maid of honor if you can't
resolve your differences

01:36.429 --> 01:39.474
or someone drops a fat-free
muffin and Holly slips on it.

01:42.644 --> 01:44.729
Look, it is my wedding
and not Ben's.

01:44.813 --> 01:46.898
If you can't be away from him
for one hour

01:46.981 --> 01:49.150
to enjoy a lovely
chicken and fish entree

01:49.234 --> 01:51.444
with your sister on the most
important day of her life--

01:51.528 --> 01:52.862
Okay, you know what,
just put me

01:52.946 --> 01:54.823
and that foreign boy
wherever you want.

01:54.906 --> 01:56.574
Good. I will.

01:58.117 --> 02:00.370
Wow. Holly seems so upset.

02:00.453 --> 02:03.206
I'd better make sure no one
pushes her down the stairs.

[instrumental music]

02:47.333 --> 02:49.627
I don't understand
why Val hates Ben.

02:49.711 --> 02:50.753
I mean, what's the big deal
if I sit

02:50.837 --> 02:52.255
next to him at her wedding?

02:52.338 --> 02:54.883
Maybe she wants you
sitting next to an American.

02:57.343 --> 03:01.306
So if we take pictures,
there's no accent. Ahem.

03:05.184 --> 03:07.770
I think you should let Val do
whatever it is she wants to do.

03:07.854 --> 03:09.606
I mean, it's the most important
night of her life.

03:09.689 --> 03:12.191
I mean, she's getting married.
You gotta be a little sensitive.

03:12.275 --> 03:13.318
If she's sitting me
next to Tina

03:13.401 --> 03:15.904
'cause if she is, I won't come.

03:15.987 --> 03:17.071
Holly, can I just say something?

03:17.155 --> 03:19.741
- What?
- I hate Gary.

03:19.824 --> 03:21.117
Maybe Gary's right.

03:21.200 --> 03:22.744
I need to be way sweeter to her

03:22.827 --> 03:25.455
and whatever my sister needs,
I'm gonna be there for her.

03:25.538 --> 03:27.165
If she trashes my boyfriend
one more time

03:27.248 --> 03:29.959
she's gonna be eating
her bouquet.

03:30.043 --> 03:31.794
Hey-hey, there's my girl.

03:34.172 --> 03:35.381
You guys are not gonna
believe this.

03:35.465 --> 03:36.925
I just got called
for an audition.

03:37.008 --> 03:39.052
The guitar player
for Coldplay's opening act

03:39.135 --> 03:40.428
just got
an intestinal parasite.

03:40.511 --> 03:41.721
He's gonna have the runs
for months.

03:41.804 --> 03:43.806
- How awesome is that?
- Oh, my God!

03:43.890 --> 03:45.934
That's huge!

03:46.017 --> 03:48.978
- Coldplay's so over.
- Okay, so, when is it?

03:49.062 --> 03:51.314
- When is it?
- In, like, an hour.

03:51.397 --> 03:53.024
And I need my good-luck charm
to come with me.

03:53.107 --> 03:54.984
Alright, let's go.
Oh, no, wait, I can't go.

03:55.068 --> 03:56.486
I have the fitting
for my maid of honor's dress

03:56.569 --> 03:57.487
and I have to be there on time

03:57.570 --> 03:58.738
and be really sweet to her

03:58.821 --> 04:00.823
because I've been
really biatchy.

04:00.907 --> 04:03.201
Okay, What if I sing
a really fast song?

04:03.284 --> 04:05.203
- Maybe you could do both.
- Okay.

04:10.875 --> 04:12.126
Oh, my Lord.

04:12.210 --> 04:15.171
This diner finally has something
delicious in it!

04:15.254 --> 04:17.966
- That's Danielle.
- You know her?

04:18.048 --> 04:19.509
Yeah, I mentioned her before.

04:19.591 --> 04:20.843
You never mentioned
her last name

04:20.927 --> 04:23.012
was my future baby's mama.

04:26.224 --> 04:28.101
Danielle, hey.

04:28.184 --> 04:30.812
- Hey.
- How are you?

04:30.895 --> 04:34.148
Oh. Alright.
Who's this guy?

04:34.232 --> 04:36.192
Oh, I'm sorry.
This is Gary.

04:36.275 --> 04:38.194
Gary, Danielle.
Danielle, Gary.

04:38.277 --> 04:40.697
Danielle goes to NYU,
and she's a dancer.

04:40.780 --> 04:44.200
Gary goes to NYU,
and he's an ass.

04:44.283 --> 04:45.535
[laughing]

04:45.618 --> 04:48.287
Tina, Tina, Tina, Tina, Tina.

04:48.371 --> 04:49.747
[sighs]

04:51.374 --> 04:54.252
So, Danielle..
Uh, have I seen you on campus?

04:54.335 --> 04:56.963
- Are we in a class together?
- No, I don't think so.

04:57.046 --> 04:59.132
Oh, well, you know, I just
thought I might've seen you

04:59.215 --> 05:02.427
in, uh, econ or finance
or marketing, you know

05:02.510 --> 05:04.178
because I'm,
I'm a business major.

05:04.262 --> 05:06.806
Yeah. So you're looking
at the next Donald Trump.

05:07.807 --> 05:09.726
With better hair, obviously.

05:10.518 --> 05:12.729
And ebony.

05:12.812 --> 05:15.398
- Can we meet up later?
- Oh, why, yes, we can.

05:15.481 --> 05:16.899
I was talking to Tina.

05:16.983 --> 05:18.901
And, uh, actually,
I'm running late.

05:18.985 --> 05:20.653
Oh, that's cool,
that's cool.

05:20.737 --> 05:21.738
I'll call you later.

05:21.821 --> 05:23.239
[laughs]

05:23.322 --> 05:25.366
Ooh. Ooh, that girl
was feeling me!

05:35.835 --> 05:37.837
Okay, Gittle, you know
you're not supposed to be

05:37.920 --> 05:39.422
pinning it to my ankles, right?

05:42.175 --> 05:44.927
Oh, that dress
looks beautiful on you.

05:45.011 --> 05:47.096
Oh, don't you just think so?

05:47.180 --> 05:50.058
It really shows off my back.
I love my back.

05:50.141 --> 05:52.643
No one expects your back
to have a six-pack.

05:53.978 --> 05:56.355
Where is Holly?
She's 45 minutes late.

05:56.439 --> 05:59.984
You know, it's not too late
to make me your moh.

06:00.068 --> 06:03.404
- Moh?
- M-O-H. Maid of honor.

06:03.488 --> 06:05.406
Yeah, I guess you have to be
one seven times

06:05.490 --> 06:07.617
before you learn the lingo.

06:07.700 --> 06:09.243
Okay, oh,
I am so sorry I'm late

06:09.327 --> 06:11.454
but Ben got this amazing
last-minute audition

06:11.537 --> 06:13.790
due to intestinal parasites,
and he got it!

06:13.873 --> 06:15.792
Well, not the parasites,
the gig!

06:15.875 --> 06:19.837
He's in the opening band
for Coldplay on November 17th.

06:19.921 --> 06:21.798
The night
of my bachelorette party?

06:21.881 --> 06:24.634
Yes, but wipe that
terrified look off your face.

06:24.717 --> 06:26.219
No, I like
the terrified look.

06:26.302 --> 06:27.929
I'm very comfortable
with it right now.

06:28.012 --> 06:29.138
You are so cute, Val.

06:29.222 --> 06:30.139
Do you think I would really

06:30.223 --> 06:31.265
miss your bachelorette party?

06:31.349 --> 06:32.809
I wouldn't miss that
for anything.

06:32.892 --> 06:34.769
What kind of maid of honor..
No, no, no, no, no.

06:34.852 --> 06:38.022
What kind of sister
do you think I am?

06:38.106 --> 06:40.316
- The best! Come here.
- Oh.

06:40.399 --> 06:42.110
You're gonna miss Ben's gig
for my party.

06:42.193 --> 06:44.112
No. On the way over here,
I called the Soho House

06:44.195 --> 06:46.447
and moved your bachelorette
party to the following night.

06:48.199 --> 06:49.200
[gasps]

06:50.743 --> 06:52.578
Oh, thank you, Jesus.

06:54.080 --> 06:55.748
Wait, I cannot believe
what I am hearing.

06:55.832 --> 06:58.084
Okay, Gittle, get me
the maid of honor dress.

07:00.086 --> 07:02.505
You changed the date
of my bachelorette party?

07:02.588 --> 07:04.257
You had no right
to do that, Holly.

07:04.340 --> 07:06.592
You know, honey, could you
slutty this up a little bit

07:06.676 --> 07:09.011
because mama's
not going home alone.

07:09.095 --> 07:10.555
Okay, Val,
what's the big deal?

07:10.638 --> 07:11.848
I only moved it one day.

07:11.931 --> 07:13.724
I don't care
if you moved it one minute.

07:13.808 --> 07:15.685
- You had no right to do that.
- Okay, look.

07:15.768 --> 07:18.771
I was just trying
to make everybody happy.

07:18.855 --> 07:21.065
Look around, Holly.
Who in this room is happy?

07:24.068 --> 07:25.945
Hear me, and hear me good,
my bachelorette party

07:26.028 --> 07:28.573
is November 17th, and if you
don't want to be there, fine.

07:28.656 --> 07:30.324
Go listen to your
little boyfriend sing.

07:30.408 --> 07:32.869
Oh-oh. My "Little boyfriend?"
What's that supposed to mean?

07:32.952 --> 07:35.329
It means, if you can't
find a way to put the woman

07:35.413 --> 07:36.914
who took care of you
your entire life

07:36.998 --> 07:39.125
first for one night,
then maybe that woman

07:39.208 --> 07:40.543
doesn't want you
as her maid of honor.

07:40.626 --> 07:42.378
Well, if that woman
can't be understanding

07:42.461 --> 07:44.881
of the girl whose boyfriend
got an unbelievable gig

07:44.964 --> 07:47.216
and wants to be there for him,
as well as for her

07:47.300 --> 07:50.720
then that girl doesn't want
to be her little maid of honor.

07:50.803 --> 07:52.346
Fine.
Consider yourself fired.

07:52.430 --> 07:54.682
No, no, no,
you can't fire me.

07:54.765 --> 07:56.517
I quit.

07:58.519 --> 08:00.521
So it's official?

08:00.605 --> 08:02.523
- I'm maid of honor?
- Yeah.

08:02.607 --> 08:04.442
[gasps]
Did you hear that

08:04.525 --> 08:06.694
you little Russian ball of fun?

08:09.447 --> 08:11.240
I'm maid of honor!

08:21.334 --> 08:24.462
Danielle, what a coincidence.

08:24.545 --> 08:26.964
- Do I know you?
- I-I'm Gary.

08:29.008 --> 08:30.801
From the diner.

08:30.885 --> 08:32.929
The ass.

08:33.011 --> 08:34.804
Oh, right. Bye.

08:34.889 --> 08:36.140
Wait a minute now.

08:36.224 --> 08:37.683
I mean,
what are you doing here?

08:37.767 --> 08:39.936
Are you following me?

08:40.019 --> 08:41.437
I teach dance.

08:41.520 --> 08:43.773
Girl, I study the dance.

08:43.856 --> 08:45.983
Really, and, uh,
whose class are you in?

08:46.067 --> 08:49.153
I'm in, uh, uh..

08:49.237 --> 08:50.655
That one.

08:50.738 --> 08:53.950
Ha! That's the one I teach.

08:54.033 --> 08:55.993
Oh, my damn!

08:56.077 --> 08:58.287
Look, obviously, Tina told you
I teach a class here

08:58.371 --> 08:59.622
and you ran over here
because you--

08:59.705 --> 09:02.667
Excuse me,
miss, "I am all of that."

09:03.751 --> 09:05.127
I am taking this dance class

09:05.211 --> 09:07.463
because my dance partner
signed us up.

09:07.546 --> 09:09.966
In fact, she's in there
waiting for me right now.

09:10.049 --> 09:12.426
Well, uh, you'd better
get in there and find her.

09:18.599 --> 09:19.809
[chuckles]

09:22.853 --> 09:24.230
Howdy, partner.

09:36.617 --> 09:39.495
What kind of freak
fires her maid of honor?

09:39.578 --> 09:41.831
I mean, can you believe
how out of control Val is being?

09:41.914 --> 09:44.917
It's like you both needed
a kidney and I gave it to you.

09:46.294 --> 09:48.963
Who moves someone else's
bachelorette party?

09:49.046 --> 09:50.506
She actually put him first.

09:50.589 --> 09:54.051
I mean,
have I ever put you first?

09:54.135 --> 09:56.262
What are you doing here?

09:56.345 --> 09:58.848
- What are you doing here?
- I was here first.

09:58.931 --> 10:00.516
Yeah, well,
I'm leaving first.

10:00.599 --> 10:04.478
Uh-uh-uh-uh.
Nobody's going anywhere.

10:04.562 --> 10:06.063
Did you trick me
into coming down here?

10:06.147 --> 10:08.691
No, it was Ben's idea.

10:08.774 --> 10:10.776
After you told me that Val
was getting on your nerves

10:10.860 --> 10:12.361
by not talking to Holly.

10:12.445 --> 10:14.030
Oh, so I was getting
on your nerves--

10:14.113 --> 10:15.781
Val, sit down.

10:17.325 --> 10:18.868
Over there.

10:20.161 --> 10:22.413
- Holly, join her.
- I don't wanna.

10:22.496 --> 10:23.748
Join her, Holly.

10:26.959 --> 10:32.006
Alright, it's time to get
everything out in the open.

10:36.302 --> 10:37.720
Val feels,
"Oh, my God

10:37.803 --> 10:39.722
"changing the date
of my bachelorette party

10:39.805 --> 10:41.974
"really, really hurt me,
and i-if I talk anymore

10:42.058 --> 10:43.351
I'm gonna cry."

10:51.067 --> 10:53.152
Holly feels, "Excuse me

10:53.235 --> 10:55.029
"but I was just trying
to do the right thing

10:55.112 --> 10:57.448
for my boyfriend
and for my sister."

10:57.531 --> 10:59.200
God, Val! Uh!

11:01.035 --> 11:02.620
Well, you know what,
you've known your sister

11:02.703 --> 11:03.871
a lot longer than your boyfriend

11:03.954 --> 11:05.664
and I think she should
take priority here.

11:05.748 --> 11:07.083
There. Open enough for you?

11:07.166 --> 11:08.626
Well, I'm sorry,
but I like both of you

11:08.709 --> 11:10.211
and I'm just trying
to balance everything

11:10.294 --> 11:11.587
and I'm just a little girl.

11:11.670 --> 11:14.256
Oh, enough with
the little girl crap!

11:14.340 --> 11:16.092
Alright, I think
what we need here, perhaps

11:16.175 --> 11:17.760
is a little negotiation.

11:17.843 --> 11:20.262
- Alright, I'm listening.
- Go ahead.

11:20.346 --> 11:21.555
I'm thinking, the-the problem--

11:21.639 --> 11:23.432
We don't spend
enough quality time together!

11:23.516 --> 11:26.060
You know? Just the two of us.
Like it used to be.

11:26.143 --> 11:27.603
Yeah, I was also gonna
suggest that--

11:27.686 --> 11:29.522
We should both set aside
one night a week

11:29.605 --> 11:31.065
to be together,
just the two of us.

11:31.148 --> 11:34.360
No boyfriends, no wedding plans,
no matter what.

11:34.443 --> 11:35.778
No, that's ridiculous.

11:35.861 --> 11:38.447
I have to schedule time
to be with my sister?

11:38.531 --> 11:39.615
Apparently, you do.

11:39.698 --> 11:41.242
How the hell's
Wednesday work for you?

11:41.325 --> 11:42.827
- Tuesday would be better.
- Fine.

11:42.910 --> 11:45.454
- Dinner and a freakin' movie?
- Sounds like a blast.

11:45.538 --> 11:47.123
Okay, I'll meet you
at your place at 7:00.

11:47.206 --> 11:49.458
7:30. And your place
is my place.

11:49.542 --> 11:52.336
- Oh, nice top, by the way.
- Thanks, it's yours.

11:54.880 --> 11:57.633
Wow.
You really have Holly down.

11:57.716 --> 12:00.678
[scoffs]
Oh, my God,
your Val was uncanny.

12:02.555 --> 12:03.764
Thanks.

12:07.226 --> 12:09.645
Great.

12:09.728 --> 12:11.856
Everybody's doing
really great.

12:14.567 --> 12:16.444
Except one person.

12:20.239 --> 12:21.699
Okay, kids,
let's take a break.

12:21.782 --> 12:23.826
Get yourselves a juice box.

12:29.415 --> 12:31.834
You're pathetic.

12:31.917 --> 12:34.044
I know you are,
but what am I?

12:37.631 --> 12:40.342
Come on, seriously,
haven't you had enough?

12:40.426 --> 12:42.344
Obviously,
you're not a dancer.

12:42.428 --> 12:44.388
Yeah, well, maybe not
this kind of dancer

12:44.472 --> 12:46.307
but I got a couple of moves.

12:49.935 --> 12:52.897
[upbeat music]

13:17.338 --> 13:18.881
[applause]

13:21.967 --> 13:24.386
You wanna come
to my birthday party?

13:36.315 --> 13:38.776
So about
the maid of honor title

13:38.859 --> 13:41.904
I am so sorry
and I love you so much

13:41.987 --> 13:45.991
but the thing is,
Holly and I got back together

13:46.075 --> 13:49.119
so unfortunately,
I'm gonna have to let you go.

13:52.540 --> 13:53.582
What do you think, Gittle?

13:53.666 --> 13:55.918
Is that warm enough,
sensitive enough?

13:56.001 --> 13:57.628
[sobbing]

13:59.672 --> 14:02.216
- Hi.
- Hey, what's going on?

14:04.385 --> 14:06.470
- Did you hear?
- No.

14:07.596 --> 14:09.056
- Lauren, I'm so sorry.
- No, no.

14:09.139 --> 14:12.393
Just please stop, okay?
It's easy to be a good winner.

14:12.476 --> 14:14.895
What's more impressive
is to be a good loser.

14:15.854 --> 14:19.441
I wanted it so much!

14:19.525 --> 14:21.652
You know what? I'm good.

14:21.735 --> 14:23.529
So who are you cooking for?

14:23.612 --> 14:24.530
Holly.

14:24.613 --> 14:27.575
Oh. Super.

14:27.658 --> 14:30.119
Yeah, we decided we're gonna
put aside one night each week

14:30.202 --> 14:32.580
to be together, kinda like
a date night for sisters.

14:32.663 --> 14:34.498
Oh. Well, that's healthy.

14:36.834 --> 14:38.043
So, whatcha making?

14:38.127 --> 14:41.005
Oh, all of Holly's
favorite things.

14:41.088 --> 14:43.048
It's gonna be so much fun,
just like the old times.

14:43.132 --> 14:44.592
No guys. Just us gals.

14:44.675 --> 14:48.345
Yeah.
I don't have a sister.

14:48.429 --> 14:50.097
- Lauren.
- No, it's okay, you know?

14:50.180 --> 14:53.267
You learn to be
your own best friend.

14:53.350 --> 14:54.727
How you doing, G.?

14:55.894 --> 14:58.397
You got any dinner plans
for tonight?

15:00.858 --> 15:03.360
You don't understand a word
I'm saying, do you?

15:06.196 --> 15:08.991
Hey, I think I once
ran over a guy with a car.

15:09.074 --> 15:12.369
Man, I feel so much better
confessing that to someone.

15:12.453 --> 15:15.456
Let's go.
Let's giddyap, Gittle.

15:15.539 --> 15:16.999
- Okay, I'm..
- Hi.

15:17.082 --> 15:18.834
Hmm.
Wow. What smells so good?

15:18.917 --> 15:20.878
Oh, roast chicken
and old lady.

15:22.671 --> 15:24.048
Okay, I'm gonna
tell you something right now

15:24.131 --> 15:25.341
that if we weren't already
getting married

15:25.424 --> 15:26.842
you'd want to marry me.

15:26.925 --> 15:28.135
Who's your favorite singer?

15:28.218 --> 15:30.346
- Michael Bolton.
- Let me rephrase.

15:30.429 --> 15:31.972
Who's your
favorite singer of all time?

15:32.056 --> 15:35.976
The best entertainer to appear
onstage anywhere, anytime.

15:36.060 --> 15:37.186
- Prince.
- Yes!

15:37.269 --> 15:40.022
So, I guess
if your fiance were to score

15:40.105 --> 15:43.359
two tickets tonight to his
concert at Radio City, then..

15:43.442 --> 15:46.195
- Shut up.
- Put on your raspberry beret!

15:46.278 --> 15:49.698
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh!

15:49.782 --> 15:52.868
- Oh, my God.
- What?

15:52.951 --> 15:56.038
Tonight is my thing with Holly.

15:56.121 --> 15:57.539
But, honey, it's Prince.

15:57.623 --> 15:59.792
And there were
scalpers involved.

16:00.918 --> 16:02.544
Oh, I can't do it.

16:02.628 --> 16:05.547
Tonight's the first night
of our weekly get-togethers.

16:05.631 --> 16:07.383
If I cancel on her,
what is that saying

16:07.466 --> 16:08.884
about my feelings for her that

16:08.967 --> 16:11.637
Prince is more important
than my sister?

16:13.681 --> 16:16.058
Alright. I get it.

16:16.141 --> 16:18.268
I guess I can get
somebody else to go.

16:18.352 --> 16:19.895
No!

16:19.978 --> 16:22.064
I mean, maybe I can
make both work, okay?

16:22.147 --> 16:23.982
Uh, ah, maybe I can move up
the sister dinner.

16:24.066 --> 16:25.734
- What time's the concert?
- 7:30.

16:25.818 --> 16:27.111
Pick you up
downstairs at 6:45.

16:27.194 --> 16:29.655
Okay, yes, I-I'll just move
the dinner up to 5:00

16:29.738 --> 16:32.908
and we'll bond until 6:30, and
then I'm going to see Prince!

16:32.991 --> 16:35.536
Oh! Oh, my goodness!
So much.

16:41.500 --> 16:42.584
- Hey.
- Hey.

16:42.668 --> 16:44.253
Rick sent me over
to give this to Val.

16:44.336 --> 16:46.088
Oh, what is it?

16:46.171 --> 16:48.507
Excuse me, I don't look
in the packages.

16:48.590 --> 16:52.010
I took an oath.
I'm a professional. God.

16:54.346 --> 16:55.764
Ticket to the Prince
concert tonight.

16:55.848 --> 16:57.725
Third row, center.

16:57.808 --> 16:59.101
Val, I'm running late.

16:59.184 --> 17:01.103
Meet you in front
of the theater at 7:00. Rick.

17:01.186 --> 17:04.982
Oh! No wonder she wants
to have dinner at 5:00.

17:05.065 --> 17:08.234
She's standing me up for a boy.

17:08.318 --> 17:10.988
After all that crap
she gave me about Ben?

17:11.070 --> 17:13.781
- You should break up with Ben.
- What?

17:15.284 --> 17:17.661
What? I don't know,
I gotta go. God.

17:21.373 --> 17:24.460
It's almost 6 o'clock.
Where the hell have you been?

17:24.542 --> 17:28.213
- I mean, let's eat.
- Aw.

17:28.297 --> 17:30.632
Val, what's the rush?

17:30.716 --> 17:32.342
This is our big night together.

17:32.426 --> 17:36.764
We wanna make it last.
And <i> last!</i>

17:36.847 --> 17:39.933
But, Holly, come on,
I'm starving here.

17:40.017 --> 17:41.101
And..

17:41.185 --> 17:43.395
[yawns]

17:43.479 --> 17:44.563
I'm feeling kind of sleepy.

17:44.646 --> 17:46.190
Maybe we should make it
an early night.

17:46.273 --> 17:49.985
No way. I've been looking
forward to this all week.

17:50.068 --> 17:53.071
This is our big night
to catch up with each other.

17:53.155 --> 17:56.533
But first,
I'm gonna take a shower.

17:56.617 --> 17:58.577
No, no, no, no,
you know what?

17:58.660 --> 18:00.329
I'm gonna take a bath.

18:00.412 --> 18:04.333
A long,
leisurely bubble bath.

18:04.416 --> 18:05.876
No, no, no!
You can't.

18:05.959 --> 18:07.753
Uh, there's, uh,
no hot water left.

18:07.836 --> 18:10.631
I used it all for the broccoli.

18:10.714 --> 18:12.216
Okay, come here, sit down.

18:12.299 --> 18:14.927
Here we go.
Let's eat.

18:15.010 --> 18:17.346
- Here's your fork.
- Wow.

18:17.429 --> 18:19.598
Pizza bagels.
You really went all out.

18:19.681 --> 18:21.266
Yep.. Dig in.

18:21.350 --> 18:24.520
Wait, Val,
didn't we forget something?

18:24.603 --> 18:26.688
We didn't say grace.

18:26.772 --> 18:28.774
Yeah, for the last 18 years.

18:31.026 --> 18:33.612
Lord..

18:33.695 --> 18:36.198
...thank you for this

18:36.281 --> 18:39.159
abundance of cheese.

18:40.202 --> 18:42.621
'This bounty of tomato sauce'

18:42.704 --> 18:44.706
'this smattering of olives..'

18:44.790 --> 18:47.000
Yeah, I think God's got
bigger fish to fry, alright

18:47.084 --> 18:48.627
so wrap it up.

18:48.710 --> 18:49.670
- Okay.
- Okay.

18:49.753 --> 18:50.879
- Amen.
- Amen.

18:50.963 --> 18:52.297
Mmm.

18:58.262 --> 18:59.721
Dessert?

18:59.805 --> 19:02.724
Val, no, wait,
we haven't even talked yet.

19:02.808 --> 19:04.434
Tell me about your week.

19:04.518 --> 19:08.522
I wanna hear the good,
bad, the happy, the sad

19:08.605 --> 19:10.065
the boring.

19:10.148 --> 19:11.567
Okay.

19:11.650 --> 19:14.570
Let's see, um,
no, nothing new with me.

19:14.653 --> 19:17.030
- You?
- Hmm.

19:17.114 --> 19:21.577
Well, Monday at 9:00,
I went to get on the subway

19:21.660 --> 19:24.371
but the entrance
on Broadway was closed.

19:24.454 --> 19:27.332
But then on Tuesday,
it was open.

19:27.416 --> 19:29.877
- Oh.
- What's the matter?

19:29.960 --> 19:33.630
- I think I ate too fast. Hmm.
- Oh, no.

19:34.965 --> 19:38.802
Yeah, uh, maybe I should
go down to the pharmacy

19:38.886 --> 19:41.805
and get some
of that Pepto-Bismol.

19:41.889 --> 19:45.434
Well, you might not
want to go to the pharmacy

19:45.517 --> 19:47.436
without your Prince ticket.

19:49.855 --> 19:51.940
You are so busted.

19:53.358 --> 19:55.777
Holly, I'm so sorry.
I'm a horrible, horrible person.

19:55.861 --> 19:57.362
But Prince, Holly, Prince!

19:57.446 --> 19:59.531
Val, I cannot believe
that you would let a date

19:59.615 --> 20:02.075
with a boy come between
you and your sister!

20:02.159 --> 20:04.578
What does that say about us,
Val, huh?

20:04.661 --> 20:06.830
That I'm not a priority?

20:06.914 --> 20:08.373
No, of course
you're my priority

20:08.457 --> 20:10.584
but Prince is only here
for one night, Holly.

20:10.667 --> 20:13.086
- Go!
- Really?

20:13.170 --> 20:15.047
Yes, really, it's Prince.

20:15.130 --> 20:17.925
Val, we can do this dinner
any night.

20:18.008 --> 20:19.468
That's the thing about sisters.

20:19.551 --> 20:21.637
We can do anything to each other
and we'll always know that

20:21.720 --> 20:23.805
we'll be there for each other.

20:23.889 --> 20:27.059
And we don't need to make
an appointment to prove it.

20:28.727 --> 20:30.437
I hate it
when you're smarter than me.

20:30.520 --> 20:32.522
Get used to it, baby.

20:33.815 --> 20:35.400
Okay, now go.
Get the hell outta here.

20:35.484 --> 20:36.693
You are so awesome!

20:36.777 --> 20:38.236
- Hey?
- Yeah?

20:38.320 --> 20:39.863
- You know I love you.
- Yeah, yeah.

20:39.947 --> 20:41.990
quit smothering me, would you?

20:45.494 --> 20:47.788
[theme music]
