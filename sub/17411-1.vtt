         BECAUSE IT'S
    SCIENTIFICALLY PROVEN

05:48.449 --> 05:49.781
    TO HELP WITH DEPRESSION.

05:49.783 --> 05:52.117
    - OH, WOW, THAT'S LIKE
  A POST-PARTUM THING, HUH?

05:52.119 --> 05:55.654

 OF THE TRADITION OF COOKING
     SLAUGHTERED ANIMALS

06:16.143 --> 06:17.609
    IN AN OPEN-AIR SETTING.

06:17.611 --> 06:19.444

  OF BEING A GOOD NEIGHBOR,

06:19.446 --> 06:21.146
   COULD YOU PLEASE REFRAIN
        FROM GRILLING

06:21.148 --> 06:22.981
       UNLESS THERE IS
    A SOUTHWESTERLY WIND?

06:22.983 --> 06:24.516
  - WHAT IF THERE'S A TORNADO

06:24.518 --> 06:25.684
  AND I CAN GET THE MEAT WIND

06:25.686 --> 06:27.519
         TO JUST BLOW
      AROUND YOUR YARD?

06:27.521 --> 06:28.820
     - OH, THAT'S AMUSING.

06:28.822 --> 06:31.790
    MY SON, HE'S AT A VERY
     IMPRESSIONABLE AGE,

06:31.792 --> 06:33.859
     SO IF YOU COULD KEEP
YOUR SEMI-NUDE SEXUAL EXPLOITS

06:33.861 --> 06:35.093
     INSIDE YOUR OWN HOUSE,

06:35.095 --> 06:36.728
        I WOULD REALLY
        APPRECIATE IT.

06:36.730 --> 06:41.400
     - IN THE PAST YEAR,
  HAVE YOU HAD ANY EXPLOITS?

06:41.402 --> 06:43.435
          - INSIDE.
     - [silently] NO. NO.

06:43.437 --> 06:44.970
  - YEAH, I DIDN'T THINK SO.
         [door slams]

06:50.476 --> 06:53.712
        - THERE HE IS!
            - AAH!

06:53.714 --> 06:56.481
     [huffing and puffing]

07:00.153 --> 07:02.053
            UH, HEY.

07:02.055 --> 07:04.523
    MY MOM ISN'T HOME, AND--

07:04.525 --> 07:06.425
        YOU KNOW WHAT?
     CAN I JUST COME IN?

07:06.427 --> 07:10.729
    WHY DON'T YOU JUST GO
    AND WAIT IN THE BACK--

07:13.499 --> 07:16.435
           - PLEASE?

07:18.704 --> 07:21.840
         - COME ON IN.

07:21.842 --> 07:24.943
        CAN I HELP YOU?

07:24.945 --> 07:27.579
        [door closes]
   - HEY, WHATEVER HAPPENED

07:27.581 --> 07:28.613
          TO SRIRACHA?

07:28.615 --> 07:30.148
          - MY BAND?
     THAT WAS YEARS AGO.

07:30.150 --> 07:31.216
       HOW DO YOU KNOW
        ABOUT MY BAND?

07:31.218 --> 07:32.451
         - GOOGLED IT.

07:32.453 --> 07:34.219
        WHAT'S IT LIKE
       TO BE ARRESTED?

07:34.221 --> 07:35.821
         - I'D PREFER
   IF YOU DIDN'T GOOGLE ME.

07:35.823 --> 07:37.689
  - YEAH, THAT'S NOT REALLY
          UP TO YOU.

07:37.691 --> 07:39.157
         SO YOU WROTE
     THAT CHRISTMAS SONG,

07:39.159 --> 07:40.158
         <i>RUNAWAY SLEIGH?</i>

07:40.160 --> 07:41.226
   - YEAH, I HATE THAT SONG.

07:41.228 --> 07:42.727
     - EH, SO DOES MY MOM.

07:42.729 --> 07:44.930
       - SHE SAID THAT?
 - GET A LOT OF MONEY FOR IT?

07:44.932 --> 07:47.232
  - A TON. WHO DOESN'T LIKE
      A CHRISTMAS SONG?

07:47.234 --> 07:48.233
    ALL RIGHT, LISTEN, MAN,

07:48.235 --> 07:49.768
          UH, YEAH,
    YOUR BUDDIES ARE GONE,

07:49.770 --> 07:51.770
      AND I GOT SOMEONE
      COMING OVER, SO--

07:51.772 --> 07:52.771
         - LIKE A GIRL?

07:52.773 --> 07:55.774
  - WHY DON'T YOU JUST DATE
       MY MOM INSTEAD?

07:55.776 --> 07:57.108
        [knock at door]

07:57.110 --> 07:58.210
         - OH, DAMN IT.

07:58.212 --> 07:59.211
    UM, HERE, GET INTO HERE.

07:59.213 --> 08:02.180
           TAKE THAT.

08:06.152 --> 08:09.087
              AHH.

08:09.089 --> 08:11.490
            - HI.
            - HI.

08:11.492 --> 08:12.724
           [laughs]
        - I BROUGHT--

08:12.726 --> 08:14.159
        - OH, THANK YOU.

08:14.161 --> 08:15.827
     YEAH, YOU LOOK GREAT.

08:15.829 --> 08:17.496
        - OH, MY G--HI.

08:17.498 --> 08:19.197
       YOU MUST BE JONAH.

08:19.199 --> 08:22.000
        I'M DAKOTA. WOW.

08:22.002 --> 08:24.503
     IT IS SUCH AN HONOR
         MEETING YOU.

08:24.505 --> 08:26.505
    YOU ARE REALLY BRAVE,
          YOU KNOW?

08:26.507 --> 08:30.242
       WHAT WAS IT LIKE
          IN AFRICA?

08:30.244 --> 08:31.977
   - I'VE NEVER BEEN TO A--
     - HE BLOCKS IT OUT.

08:31.979 --> 08:34.044
      YEAH, HE'S HAVING
       A NIGHT TERROR.

08:34.047 --> 08:36.982
     - BUT IT'S DAYTIME.
 - YEAH, NOT IN AFRICA, SO--

08:36.984 --> 08:38.116
        - I DON'T KNOW
  WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

08:38.118 --> 08:39.618
  - HE JUST STARTS SCREAMING
         AND SHAKING.

08:39.620 --> 08:41.253
  THE ONLY THING YOU CAN DO
         IS HOLD HIM.

08:41.255 --> 08:43.288
    JONAH, JUST DON'T SAY
       ANYTHING, BUDDY.

08:43.289 --> 08:45.957
   HUH? JUST BREATHE, JONAH.

08:45.959 --> 08:47.292
          JONAH? YEAH?

08:47.294 --> 08:48.994
      YOUR NAME IS JONAH?

08:48.996 --> 08:53.231
       - SO HE DOESN'T
      REMEMBER ANYTHING?

08:53.233 --> 08:55.534
          [whispers]
      THE SWEAT LODGES?

08:55.536 --> 08:57.168
          THE VOODOO?

08:57.170 --> 08:59.771
           - JONAH?
          - NOTHING?

09:03.910 --> 09:07.579
        - I WOULD SAY
    THAT IF IT WEREN'T...

09:07.581 --> 09:10.181
         [choked up]
       FOR MY FATHER...

09:10.183 --> 09:11.983
     I'D BE DEAD RIGHT NOW.

09:11.985 --> 09:14.853
            - OH.
  - I OWE YOU MY LIFE, DAD.

09:17.890 --> 09:20.625
          [whispers]
          I OWN YOU.

09:23.563 --> 09:26.231
        - HEY, GOT ANY
     OF THAT CHEESE LEFT?

09:26.233 --> 09:28.567
          - MARCUS...

09:28.569 --> 09:30.669
YEAH, I-I DON'T WANT YOU TO GET
       THE WRONG IDEA.

09:30.671 --> 09:32.671
  WE'RE NOT GONNA BE FRIENDS.

09:32.673 --> 09:35.206
- I THINK WE CAN BECOME FRIENDS,
         AND HONESTLY

09:35.208 --> 09:36.875
    I THINK WE'RE ALREADY
        PRETTY CLOSE.

09:36.877 --> 09:39.911
AND ANYWAY YOU OWE ME A DINNER
   FOR WHAT I DID FOR YOU.

09:39.913 --> 09:41.580
             - I--

09:41.582 --> 09:43.315
      YEAH, I-I DIDN'T--
    I DIDN'T SAY A DINNER.

09:43.317 --> 09:45.050
     - I'M SAYING A DINNER.

09:45.052 --> 09:47.586
       [crowd cheering,
      players grunting]

09:47.588 --> 09:49.654
        [whistle blows]

09:51.857 --> 09:54.292
 SO WHAT DOES THAT TASTE LIKE?

09:54.294 --> 09:56.928
   - HOWEVER GOOD IT LOOKS,
 MULTIPLE THAT BY A THOUSAND.

09:56.930 --> 09:57.963
       - CAN I SMELL IT?

09:57.965 --> 10:01.032
        - YOU CAN TRY
      TO JUST SMELL IT.

10:06.305 --> 10:09.174
           - [sniffs]

10:09.176 --> 10:10.208
    - WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, HEY.

10:10.210 --> 10:12.043
        HEY, PUT THAT
     BACK IN THE BUCKET.

10:12.045 --> 10:15.113
 - I'M ALREADY DRINKING SODA
       FROM THE BOTTLE.

10:15.115 --> 10:19.684
        WE'RE THROUGH
      THE LOOKING GLASS.

10:19.686 --> 10:22.220
              MM.

10:22.222 --> 10:25.123
              MM.

10:28.194 --> 10:30.762
          MM, MM, MM.

10:30.764 --> 10:33.832
   CAN'T GET ANY MORE MEAT
          OFF OF IT.

10:36.669 --> 10:38.370
             SO...

10:38.372 --> 10:40.338
 DID YOU EVER GET MADE FUN OF
          AT SCHOOL

10:40.340 --> 10:41.873
      WHEN YOU WERE A KID?

10:41.875 --> 10:43.041
     - A LITTLE, I GUESS.
         WHY, DO YOU?

10:43.043 --> 10:45.010
         - CONSTANTLY.

10:45.012 --> 10:48.346
  EVERYONE MAKES FUN OF ME,
     EVEN THE NICE KIDS.

10:48.348 --> 10:49.914
           [smacking]

10:49.916 --> 10:54.185
    I GUESS I BRING IT OUT
          IN PEOPLE.

10:54.187 --> 10:56.287
             OKAY.

10:56.289 --> 10:59.024
     THIS TASTES NOTHING
          LIKE SOY.

10:59.026 --> 11:02.160
       - NO, IT DOES NOT.

11:11.103 --> 11:13.238
        SO ONE BY ONE,
   MY FRIENDS GET MARRIED.

11:13.240 --> 11:16.741
AND THEIR LIVES AS THEY KNOW IT
  ARE TAKEN AWAY FROM THEM.

11:16.743 --> 11:19.310
    I MEAN, MY FRIEND ANDY
    HAS TO ASK PERMISSION

11:19.312 --> 11:20.445
   TO GO OUT AND SHOOT HOOPS.

11:20.447 --> 11:23.114
        - WHAT A PUSS.
          - EXACTLY.

11:23.116 --> 11:25.316
         TO FREEDOM.
        - TO FREEDOM!

11:27.286 --> 11:30.288
       - LET'S GET HIM!
   - [huffing and puffing]

11:30.290 --> 11:31.356
      - HEY, COME HERE.
           - WILL!

11:31.358 --> 11:32.824
      - COME HERE, YEAH.
          TAKE THIS.

11:32.826 --> 11:34.325
     TAKE THIS, TAKE THIS.

11:34.327 --> 11:35.727
          ALL RIGHT,
  PULL BACK WHEN THEY COME.

11:35.729 --> 11:36.761
  PULL BACK WHEN THEY COME.
           - OKAY.

11:36.763 --> 11:37.762
             OKAY.

11:37.764 --> 11:38.963
            - YAHHH!

11:38.965 --> 11:42.701
      [overlapping shouts]

11:42.703 --> 11:43.902
           - [laughs]

11:43.904 --> 11:45.270
          - HEY-OH!
            - OW!

11:45.272 --> 11:47.205
            - OW!
     LET'S GET SOME ICE.

11:47.207 --> 11:49.374
            - I, UM,

11:49.376 --> 11:52.210
          I ENTERED
    MY SCHOOL TALENT SHOW.

11:52.212 --> 11:54.312
   I-I THINK YOU SHOULD COME.

11:54.314 --> 11:56.748
 - WELL, I MADE A SACRED VOW
       NEVER TO ATTEND

11:56.750 --> 11:57.849
  A MIDDLE SCHOOL TALENT SHOW,

11:57.851 --> 11:59.184
    BUT I WISH YOU THE BEST.

11:59.186 --> 12:00.785
     - THEY'RE LAME, RIGHT?

12:00.787 --> 12:03.121
I GUESS I REALLY JUST ENTERED
     TO CHEER UP MY MOM.

12:03.123 --> 12:04.322
       - WHY, IS SHE SAD?

12:04.324 --> 12:06.357
     - SHE CRIES SOMETIMES.

12:06.359 --> 12:09.027
   WHICH IS, AGAIN, WHY YOU
 SHOULD COME OVER FOR DINNER.

12:09.029 --> 12:11.229
- OH, YEAH, AS MUCH AS I LOVE
  A CRYING WOMAN, YOU KNOW--

12:11.231 --> 12:14.299
  - WELL, I'M NOT ASKING YOU
     TO DATE HER ANYMORE.

12:14.301 --> 12:18.169
       WE'RE NEIGHBORS.
WE COULD AT LEAST BE FRIENDS.

12:18.171 --> 12:20.071
            PLEASE?

12:20.073 --> 12:22.307
      - IF YOU NEEDED ME
      TO BE JONAH AGAIN,

12:22.309 --> 12:24.375
           I'D DO IT.

12:24.377 --> 12:28.246
     [gentle guitar music]

12:28.248 --> 12:30.381
            both:
¶ BABY, YOU LIGHT UP MY WORLD

12:30.383 --> 12:32.350
      ¶ LIKE NOBODY ELSE

12:32.352 --> 12:35.019
   ¶ THE WAY THAT YOU FLIP
         YOUR HAIR ¶

    ¶ GETS ME OVERWHELMED

12:36.957 --> 12:39.290
     ¶ AND WHEN YOU SMILE
       AT THE GROUND ¶

12:39.292 --> 12:41.159
   ¶ IT AIN'T HARD TO TELL

12:41.161 --> 12:44.262
   ¶ YOU DON'T KNOW, OH OH

12:44.264 --> 12:48.099
       ¶ YOU DON'T KNOW
      YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL ¶

12:52.271 --> 12:53.872
            - WOW.
           - YEAH?

12:53.874 --> 12:55.306
           - YEAH.
    - IT WAS REALLY GREAT.

12:55.308 --> 12:57.942
             - YEP.

12:57.944 --> 13:00.812
     - LET'S DO IT AGAIN.
           - OKAY.

13:00.814 --> 13:04.182
        - ¶ SLOW DOWN,
     YOU MOVE TOO FAST ¶

13:04.184 --> 13:06.818
     ¶ YOU'VE GOT TO MAKE
      THE MORNING LAST ¶

13:06.820 --> 13:11.222
     ¶ JUST KICKING DOWN
    THE COBBLESTONES... ¶

13:11.224 --> 13:12.323
          - [snickers]

13:12.325 --> 13:14.259
        - DO YOU LIKE
    THE SEITAN SPARE RIBS?

13:14.261 --> 13:15.293
    - MM, HOW COULD YOU NOT?

13:15.295 --> 13:18.530
      - [snorts, giggles]

13:18.532 --> 13:20.365
         - I'M SORRY.
        THAT WAS RUDE.

13:20.367 --> 13:21.399
             - YES.

13:21.401 --> 13:25.203
          - LISTEN,
    THIS IS ABSOLUTELY...

13:25.205 --> 13:26.905
  EDIBLE, AND I'M SURE IT'S...

13:26.907 --> 13:29.541
      HEALING EVERYTHING
         INSIDE OF ME

13:29.543 --> 13:32.410
       AS--AS I EAT IT.
          [laughter]

13:32.412 --> 13:34.979
    - MARCUS, WILL YOU GO
IN THE KITCHEN, PLEASE, DARLING?

13:34.981 --> 13:36.314
            - I--
           - GO ON.

13:36.316 --> 13:38.216
       WIPE YOUR HANDS
       ON YOUR NAPKIN.

13:38.218 --> 13:41.286
             GO ON.

13:44.190 --> 13:45.223
   I THINK YOU SHOULD LEAVE.

13:45.225 --> 13:47.358
          - [chuckles]

13:47.360 --> 13:49.093
     WHAT? ARE YOU SERIOUS?

13:49.095 --> 13:50.195
        - OH, YES, I AM.

13:50.197 --> 13:51.863
    YOU CLEARLY DON'T WANT
         TO BE HERE.

13:51.865 --> 13:53.364
  I THINK YOU SHOULD LEAVE.
     - NO, NO, NO, I'M--

13:53.366 --> 13:54.566
        LISTEN, I JUST--

13:54.568 --> 13:56.367
    I'VE JUST NEVER EATEN
      TOFU BEFORE, SO--

13:56.369 --> 13:58.269
    - WELL, IT'S NOT TOFU.
         IT'S SEITAN.

13:58.271 --> 13:59.904
        - SEITAN, FUTON,

13:59.906 --> 14:01.439
        WHATEVER IT IS,

14:01.441 --> 14:03.274
           I THINK,
    IF WE'RE BEING HONEST,

14:03.276 --> 14:04.275
         THAT YOU ARE--

14:04.277 --> 14:05.310
         - WHAT? WHAT?

14:05.312 --> 14:07.912
            - NO.
- YOU THINK I'M OVERREACTING?

14:07.914 --> 14:10.315
 YOU THINK I'M OVERREACTING?
    I'M NOT OVERREACTING.

14:10.317 --> 14:11.516
     I HAD A VERY BAD WEEK.

14:11.518 --> 14:13.084
      THEY LOST MY COUCH
       ON THE WAY HERE.

14:13.086 --> 14:15.987
I DON'T KNOW IF MY KID IS DOING
    WELL IN THIS NEW CITY.

14:15.989 --> 14:17.222
  THE JOB THAT I WAS SUPPOSE
    TO HAVE FELL THROUGH,

14:17.224 --> 14:19.290
         SO I'VE HAD
      A VERY HARD WEEK,

14:19.292 --> 14:22.327
 AND YOU--YOU WITH YOUR MEAT
        AND YOUR SMOKE

14:22.329 --> 14:23.628
      AND YOUR CARDIGAN--

14:23.630 --> 14:25.296
      [hyperventilating]
             I--

14:25.298 --> 14:27.265
        I'M DOING THIS
       BY MYSELF, OKAY?

14:27.267 --> 14:29.300
  I'M DOING THIS BY MYSELF.
  I DON'T NEED THE JUDGMENT.

14:29.302 --> 14:31.402
         I DON'T NEED--

14:31.404 --> 14:34.372
           [sobbing]

14:34.374 --> 14:38.943
     NOW I'M CRYING AGAIN.

14:38.945 --> 14:40.378
      YOU CAN LEAVE NOW.
            IT'S--

14:40.380 --> 14:43.381
    YOU DON'T HAVE TO STAY
          FOR THIS.

14:46.619 --> 14:48.653
           - I, UH,
     I THINK I'M GONNA--

14:48.655 --> 14:50.622
   I THINK I'M GONNA STAY,
       IF THAT'S OKAY.

14:50.624 --> 14:52.557
   I'M GONNA GIVE THIS TOFU
        ANOTHER SHOT.

14:52.559 --> 14:57.362
       YOU KNOW, WE'RE--

14:57.364 --> 15:00.365
    WE'RE NEIGHBORS, RIGHT?

15:00.367 --> 15:03.301
      - IT WOULD BE NICE
TO BE NEIGHBORS, WOULDN'T IT?

15:03.303 --> 15:05.637
     - LET'S BE NEIGHBORS.

15:10.142 --> 15:11.943
          - "CELLO."
          - "CELLO."

15:11.945 --> 15:14.946
       - LISTEN, I KNOW
   WE DON'T HAVE ANY PLANS,

15:14.948 --> 15:16.180
    BUT I HAVE THIS CRAZY--

15:16.182 --> 15:17.348
     - OH, I THINK I KNOW
     WHERE THIS IS GOING.

15:17.350 --> 15:19.517
            - NO--
  - HE'S TOUCHING HER BUTT!

15:21.921 --> 15:23.488
         - I JUST--MY--

15:23.490 --> 15:25.423
        YOU JUST SAID
   THAT YOU LOVE POPOVERS,

15:25.425 --> 15:29.160
  AND I'M DYING FOR MY GIRLS
        TO MEET JONAH.

15:29.162 --> 15:30.395
   HE'S SUCH AN INSPIRATION.

15:30.397 --> 15:31.663
     - OH, YEAH, UH, YEAH.

15:31.665 --> 15:33.064
     DAKOTA, ABOUT JONAH--

15:33.066 --> 15:35.466
     IT'S A FUNNY STORY,
          ACTUALLY.

15:35.468 --> 15:37.468
      - I WANT YOU TO KNOW

15:37.470 --> 15:40.238
         THAT I KNOW
     I STILL OWE YOU ONE.

15:40.240 --> 15:43.675
      I HAVEN'T FORGOTTEN.

15:43.677 --> 15:48.479
   MAYBE YOU COULD CASH IN
 WHILE THE KIDS ARE PLAYING.

15:51.550 --> 15:54.285
            - JONAH.

15:54.287 --> 15:56.387
         OH, MARCUS.
 MARCUS, IS YOUR MOM AROUND?

15:56.389 --> 15:58.556
   - SHE NEEDS TO MEDITATE.
   SHE HAD A HORRIBLE DAY.

15:58.558 --> 16:02.493
    - PERFECT. COME WITH ME.

16:02.495 --> 16:04.562
           - [grunts]

16:07.199 --> 16:09.100
      - ARE YOU HUNGRY?
         - [chuckles]

16:09.102 --> 16:10.535
     - 'CAUSE I'M FAMISHED.

16:10.537 --> 16:12.437
 - NO WAY I'M WEARING A TIARA.

16:12.439 --> 16:15.373
   - HEY, YOU WEAR A TIARA,
      I'LL GET YOU RIBS.

16:15.375 --> 16:17.375
         - FULL RACK?
 - HALF RACK WITH TWO SIDES.

16:17.377 --> 16:19.410
     - BOTTOMLESS SODAS?
           - DEAL.

16:19.412 --> 16:20.545
             - OW.

16:20.547 --> 16:22.513
    - TIME TO PLAY DRESS-UP!

16:22.515 --> 16:24.315
           - TIARA...

16:24.317 --> 16:26.284
      - OOH, THAT LOOKS
     REALLY GOOD ON YOU.

16:26.286 --> 16:28.987
          - DAKOTA?
 - NOW WE HAVE ANOTHER WAND.

16:28.989 --> 16:30.688
           - NO--NO!

16:30.690 --> 16:32.090
        [meat sizzling]

16:32.092 --> 16:35.026
   YOU GOTTA TAKE THOSE OFF
          RIGHT NOW.

16:35.028 --> 16:36.394
  THERE'S A CRAZY VEGAN LADY
          NEXT DOOR,

16:36.396 --> 16:39.364
AND THERE'S A NORTHERLY WIND.
            - HI.

16:39.366 --> 16:40.365
             - HI.

16:40.367 --> 16:41.699
        - MM. HEY, DAD.

16:41.701 --> 16:44.335
  HOW ARE THE STEAKS COMING?
        I AM STARVING.

16:44.337 --> 16:46.304
         - MARCUS, NO!

16:46.306 --> 16:49.107
       - WHO'S MARCUS?
WHAT--WHAT IS SHE TALKING ABOUT?

16:49.109 --> 16:51.209
       WHY DID SHE CALL
       YOUR SON MARCUS?

16:51.211 --> 16:52.677
         - YOUR SON?
         HE'S MY SON.

16:52.679 --> 16:55.146
     - WILL, WHAT IS SHE
        TALKING ABOUT?

16:55.148 --> 16:57.448
        - YOU USED HIM.

16:57.450 --> 16:59.050
        YOU FORCED HIM
         TO EAT MEAT

16:59.052 --> 17:01.352
  SO THAT YOU COULD HAVE SEX
          WITH HER.

17:01.354 --> 17:03.421
       - IT SOUNDS BAD
  WHEN YOU SAY IT LIKE THAT.

17:07.059 --> 17:08.726
           - JACKASS.

17:08.728 --> 17:10.627
        GIRLS, COME ON.

17:10.630 --> 17:11.762
     GIRLS, WE'RE LEAVING.

17:11.765 --> 17:13.330
         - PSYCHOPATH.

17:13.333 --> 17:14.732
    COME ON, OVER THE FENCE.

17:14.733 --> 17:16.401
          CLIMB UP.
 - ARE WE STILL ON FOR RIBS?

17:16.403 --> 17:19.270
      - NO, YOU ARE NOT
      STILL ON FOR RIBS.

17:19.271 --> 17:20.704
     - BUT WE'RE FRIENDS.
- YOU'RE NOT FRIENDS, MARCUS.

17:20.707 --> 17:22.173
         - YES, WE ARE.

17:22.175 --> 17:25.343
        - HE USED YOU.
 THAT IS NOT WHAT FRIENDS DO.

17:25.345 --> 17:27.178
       - COME ON, WILL.
          TELL HER.

17:27.180 --> 17:29.480
         WE'RE FRIENDS.

17:33.385 --> 17:34.752
           - COME ON.

17:34.754 --> 17:36.821
           I'M SORRY.

17:45.264 --> 17:46.798
   - YOU KNOW, I ACTUALLY--
      I REALLY DO THINK

17:46.800 --> 17:48.266
       IT'S FOR THE BEST.

17:48.268 --> 17:49.534
       I MEAN, THE KID
     KEPT COMING AROUND,

17:49.536 --> 17:50.768
   HE'S GONNA START FEELING
          ATTACHED,

17:50.770 --> 17:52.136
     AND I JUST CAN'T GET
   THAT ATTACHED RIGHT NOW.

17:52.138 --> 17:53.271
      - OH, OF COURSE NOT.

17:53.273 --> 17:54.338
    - YEAH, I GOT TOO MUCH
          GOING ON.

17:54.340 --> 17:55.673
        - VERY BUSY MAN.

17:55.675 --> 17:57.141
            - WHAT?

17:57.143 --> 17:59.110
             WHAT?

17:59.112 --> 18:01.145
   - DUDE, THIS IS YOUR M.O.

18:01.147 --> 18:03.114
 YOU NEVER LET YOURSELF CARE.
       YOU'RE THAT GUY.

18:03.116 --> 18:05.283
     - THAT'S NOT WHO I AM.

18:05.285 --> 18:06.417
       - OF COURSE IT IS.

18:06.419 --> 18:07.485
    ALL RIGHT, THE SECOND
        A RELATIONSHIP

18:07.487 --> 18:09.687
      GETS TOO SERIOUS,
         YOU'RE GONE.

18:09.689 --> 18:12.090
THE FIRST FIGHT YOUR BAND HAS,
          YOU QUIT.

18:12.092 --> 18:14.225
   YOU NEVER GIVE ANYTHING
          A CHANCE.

18:14.227 --> 18:15.660
  NOW THIS WEIRD NEIGHBOR KID

18:15.662 --> 18:19.197
   STARTS CARING ABOUT YOU,
WHICH I CAN'T UNDERSTAND AT ALL,

18:19.199 --> 18:21.365
         AND GOOD-BYE.

18:21.367 --> 18:23.468
     YOU KNOW WHAT SUCKS
   ABOUT NOT HAVING ANYONE

18:23.470 --> 18:24.635
        YOU CARE ABOUT?

18:24.637 --> 18:27.371
    YOU DON'T HAVE ANYONE
       YOU CARE ABOUT.

18:27.373 --> 18:31.609
 JUST--I'M JUST GONNA GO PLAY
       WITH THESE GUYS.

18:31.611 --> 18:33.644
         YEAH. YEAH.
       WHAT'S UP, GUYS?

18:33.646 --> 18:35.279
     - YOUR BROTHER WANTS
         TO PLAY TOO.

18:35.281 --> 18:36.447
          - YOU READY?

18:36.449 --> 18:37.849
  - FILL IT UP A LITTLE MORE.

18:37.851 --> 18:40.651
        - ONE, TWO...
       - TWO PLUS ONE.

18:40.653 --> 18:43.254
            - THREE.

18:52.865 --> 18:55.566
         - A CAPPELLA?

18:55.568 --> 18:57.201
           OH, NO.
           OH, NO.

18:57.203 --> 18:58.736
             ANDY!

18:58.738 --> 19:00.304
           - WHAT?
           - ANDY!

19:00.306 --> 19:03.708
     [cheers and applause]

19:06.445 --> 19:09.247
 - HEY, I THOUGHT I TOLD YOU
  TO STAY AWAY FROM MY SON.

19:09.249 --> 19:11.415
  OR ARE YOU HERE TO SEDUCE
       SOME OTHER BOY?

19:11.417 --> 19:14.752
  OKAY, THAT SOUNDED DARKER
    THAN I INTENDED IT TO.

19:14.754 --> 19:16.754
  - YOU NEED TO STOP MARCUS
       FROM DOING THIS.

19:16.756 --> 19:18.422
        THIS IS GOING
  TO BE HUMILIATING FOR HIM.

19:18.424 --> 19:20.291
      - WHAT, AS OPPOSED
  TO PUTTING HIM IN A TIARA?

19:20.293 --> 19:22.193
 - YOU CANNOT LET HIM DO THIS.

19:22.195 --> 19:24.328
     IT IS SOCIAL SUICIDE.

19:24.330 --> 19:27.398
AND FOR THE RECORD, I DID NOT
  FORCE MARCUS TO EAT MEAT.

19:27.400 --> 19:29.400
        HE LIKES MEAT.
         HE LOVES IT.

19:29.402 --> 19:30.768
      HE'S A CARNIVORE.
    YOU DO NOT WANT TO BE

19:30.770 --> 19:31.903
       IN A PLANE CRASH
         IN THE ANDES

19:31.905 --> 19:33.404
    WHEN MARCUS IS ONBOARD.

19:33.406 --> 19:34.805
            [cheers]

19:34.807 --> 19:37.408
IF YOU'RE NOT GONNA STOP THIS,
           I WILL.

19:37.410 --> 19:39.443
   - HI. NICE TO MEET YOU.
           - ANDY!

19:39.445 --> 19:42.413
     [cheers and applause]

19:45.685 --> 19:51.789

           [applause]

19:56.429 --> 19:58.629
- MARCUS, LOOK, I DON'T THINK
     THIS IS A GOOD IDEA.

19:58.631 --> 20:00.698
        - MARCUS BOWA.
- YOU WON'T BE MY MOM'S FRIEND,

20:00.700 --> 20:02.366
AND MY SINGING MAKES HER HAPPY.

20:02.368 --> 20:05.336
          - MARCUS.
- MARCUS, DON'T GO OUT THERE.

20:05.338 --> 20:07.271
     - SO JUST WALK AWAY
        FROM IT, HUH?

20:07.273 --> 20:09.373
    FIGURES THAT WOULD BE
         YOUR ADVICE.

20:09.375 --> 20:11.676
- MARCUS, DO NOT GO OUT THERE.
        I AM SERIOUS.

20:11.678 --> 20:12.977
 I DON'T WANT YOU TO GET HURT.

20:12.979 --> 20:15.279
    - YOU'RE TALKING TO ME
     LIKE WE'RE FRIENDS.

20:15.281 --> 20:16.881
  WE'RE NOT FRIENDS, REMEMBER?

20:16.883 --> 20:20.885
          - MARCUS.
          - MARCUS.
