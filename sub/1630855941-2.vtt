03:38.343 --> 03:40.553
Absolutely not. Absolutely not.

03:42.180 --> 03:43.681
The contact was minimal.

03:44.557 --> 03:46.100
You can see I was hamming it up,

03:47.310 --> 03:51.773
knocked over by David's imaginary kick.

32:10.053 --> 32:12.055
He wasn't happy.

32:13.222 --> 32:14.432
That's understandable.

35:25.123 --> 35:27.250
At the end of the match,

35:27.250 --> 35:32.672
he was sensible enough
to exchange shirts with me.
