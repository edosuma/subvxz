00:48.908 --> 00:51.543
Jenny.

00:56.349 --> 00:58.917
Right now we are hearing
from police chatter

00:58.919 --> 01:01.653
that the Geckos did in fact escape.

01:01.655 --> 01:04.322
Local sheriffs and DHS have
no leads on the vehicle.

01:04.324 --> 01:06.358
- Best news I heard all day.
- The Geckos have a knack for flashy exits.

01:06.360 --> 01:08.593
They shot their way out of the bank...

01:12.365 --> 01:13.899
$30 million

01:13.901 --> 01:15.567
and bank teller Monica Garza
as a human sh...

01:20.506 --> 01:22.707
You got a first-aid kit in this beast?

01:28.582 --> 01:30.582
Let me explain something
to you here, Jacob.

01:30.584 --> 01:33.251
Now, there's only one song
that we're gonna be singing

01:33.253 --> 01:34.519
on this little road trip,

01:34.521 --> 01:36.721
and it ain't "99 bottles
of Beer on the Wall."

01:36.723 --> 01:39.624
The song is called "My way."

01:39.626 --> 01:42.460
So if I say make a turn,
you're gonna make a turn.

01:42.462 --> 01:45.530
If I say don't talk, you don't talk.

01:45.532 --> 01:50.202
But if I ask you for a
first-aid kit, you're gonna...

01:50.204 --> 01:52.671
Thank you.

02:00.247 --> 02:02.614
Pastor Jacob Fuller, huh?

02:04.551 --> 02:07.319
Guess that explains all that,
uh, hellfire and damnation

02:07.321 --> 02:08.586
back at the motel, huh?

02:08.589 --> 02:10.288
You do know the one

02:10.289 --> 02:11.656
about turning the other cheek, I hope.

02:11.658 --> 02:14.392
I prefer the Old Testament.

02:14.394 --> 02:18.597
Well, this is gonna be
real, real simple, padre.

02:18.599 --> 02:20.765
We, uh, reach the crossing at acuña,

02:20.767 --> 02:22.500
you wave your passports,

02:22.502 --> 02:24.703
flash your pretty, corn-fed smiles,

02:24.705 --> 02:26.671
and then we're gonna sail on through.

02:26.673 --> 02:30.408
Richie and I will close our
deal with our guy in Mexico.

02:30.410 --> 02:32.577
After that, we go our separate ways.

02:32.579 --> 02:34.579
Nobody else is gonna get
hurt. You got my word.

02:34.581 --> 02:38.283
What about that bank teller
you took hostage in Abilene?

02:38.285 --> 02:39.651
You give her your word?

02:45.391 --> 02:47.993
Yeah, well...

02:47.995 --> 02:51.997
I didn't know you were
capable of not talking.

02:51.999 --> 02:54.733
Let me help you continue
to save your breath.

02:54.735 --> 02:57.302
I don't need you to promise
my family's gonna be all right.

02:57.304 --> 02:59.738
I know they will be.
You know how I know that?

02:59.740 --> 03:02.607
'Cause I'm behind the wheel now.

03:02.609 --> 03:06.011
And I'm gonna make it my
mission, my singular mission,

03:06.013 --> 03:08.513
to get us all across that border...

03:08.515 --> 03:12.484
Not for you, not for all your riches...

03:12.486 --> 03:15.420
For the only two people
I have left in this world.

03:15.422 --> 03:18.757
I'm a professional thief, not a killer.

03:18.759 --> 03:22.527
It ain't you I'm worried about.

03:36.375 --> 03:38.610
You don't have to look for me, Richard.

03:38.612 --> 03:40.645
You're almost home.

03:40.647 --> 03:42.380
But you must be strong.

03:42.382 --> 03:44.582
They will try and stop you.

03:44.584 --> 03:46.584
Who?

03:46.586 --> 03:51.523
The ones with the shadows
across their hearts.

03:53.426 --> 03:54.859
You can see now.

03:58.531 --> 04:01.099
Hey, Richie.

04:01.101 --> 04:03.535
Park it somewhere, will you?

04:03.537 --> 04:05.103
And relax.

04:05.105 --> 04:06.604
It's gonna be smooth sailing from here.

04:45.846 --> 04:48.413
Fashionably late as usual, I see.

04:48.415 --> 04:49.681
I have a problem.

04:49.683 --> 04:51.716
Would you like to know what it is?

04:51.718 --> 04:53.585
I'm sorry, did you say
that you have a problem?

04:53.587 --> 04:56.154
I am sitting at my favorite panadería,

04:56.156 --> 04:57.856
I'm staring at my favorite concha,

04:57.858 --> 05:00.458
and I cannot eat it.

05:00.460 --> 05:01.860
Yeah? Well, mine trumps yours.

05:01.862 --> 05:03.461
I cannot eat it

05:03.463 --> 05:07.632
because you y tu pinche hermano,

05:07.634 --> 05:12.637
and your very public trail
of destrucción y mierda

05:12.639 --> 05:15.740
has cost me my appetite!

05:15.742 --> 05:17.842
Okay, okay. Easy there, Khan.

05:17.844 --> 05:19.477
Just when I thought

05:19.479 --> 05:21.746
you couldn't ruin my efforts anymore...

05:21.748 --> 05:25.717
My employees tell me that you
have a rinche on your tail?

05:25.719 --> 05:28.719
Carlos, it is the very
nonexistence of your efforts

05:28.721 --> 05:30.622
that has led us to this juncture.

05:30.624 --> 05:32.757
In fact, I'm starting to rethink
that steep commission of yours.

05:32.759 --> 05:34.426
You know, $10 million seems like

05:34.428 --> 05:35.894
a lot of money to pay for nothing.

05:35.896 --> 05:40.832
And how exactly do you plan
to get into Mexico without me?

05:40.834 --> 05:42.767
Same way we figured
everything else out so far...

05:42.769 --> 05:43.902
On our own.

05:43.904 --> 05:44.903
El rinche?

05:44.905 --> 05:46.604
Well...

05:46.606 --> 05:48.473
I already took care of him, too.

05:48.475 --> 05:52.177
A rinche is like a rabid dog.

05:52.179 --> 05:57.449
Once it picks up on your scent,
it's not easy to take him down.

05:57.451 --> 05:59.784
- I'm real sorry about this.
- Come on, Hank.

05:59.786 --> 06:01.519
Captain's orders.

06:01.521 --> 06:03.621
- We're gonna need to give you an exam.
- Don't need to.

06:03.623 --> 06:06.458
It's obvious the son of a
bitch has got brain damage.

06:06.460 --> 06:08.460
- Captain.
- You take a real good look

06:08.462 --> 06:10.462
at what you done, Ranger.

06:10.464 --> 06:12.664
Although I shouldn't even call you that.

06:12.666 --> 06:13.998
If I had anything to say about it,

06:14.000 --> 06:16.801
you wouldn't be wearing
that star come sundown.

06:16.803 --> 06:19.537
That is the third time you've
disobeyed my direct orders,

06:19.539 --> 06:21.206
and nearly got two more men killed for it.

06:21.208 --> 06:23.508
You want to know why
Earl McGraw was the best

06:23.510 --> 06:24.776
even when he strayed from the rules?

06:25.878 --> 06:29.214
He knew when his reach
couldn't exceed his grasp.

06:29.216 --> 06:32.250
And you done reached too damn far, son.

06:32.252 --> 06:34.719
And got closer to the Geckos than anybody.

06:36.989 --> 06:38.890
Take him to Austin.

06:38.892 --> 06:42.025
Let's let the review board decide
what they gonna do with him.

06:42.829 --> 06:43.962
Come on.

06:46.699 --> 06:49.801
What the hell you think
you're doing out there, boy?

06:49.803 --> 06:51.970
Haven't you heard a damn word I've said?

06:51.972 --> 06:53.838
Make no mistake about it, Frederico,

06:53.840 --> 06:56.741
I know exactly how you
feel... I've been there.

06:56.743 --> 06:58.843
A couple of times, to tell the truth.

06:58.845 --> 07:02.046
You're up there all alone
and frustrated out there

07:02.048 --> 07:05.550
with your compadres putting
out a half-assed effort.

07:05.552 --> 07:07.552
But you can't go getting all grandiose

07:07.554 --> 07:09.654
and thinking you can do it all on your own.

07:09.656 --> 07:11.656
That's not gonna do anybody any good.

07:11.658 --> 07:15.059
'Cause you got to remember,
Frederico, you are not alone.

07:15.061 --> 07:17.028
You're part of a team.

07:17.030 --> 07:19.764
And you can never turn
your back on your team...

07:19.766 --> 07:23.067
Or worse, put yourself above 'em.

07:24.870 --> 07:29.274
Never go against another Ranger.

07:29.276 --> 07:30.875
Never.

07:30.877 --> 07:33.745
Come on, Freddie.

07:33.747 --> 07:36.080
Hold up there.

07:36.082 --> 07:38.917
I just don't think we're
gonna need these for the ride.

07:38.919 --> 07:41.019
Thanks, Hank.

07:43.690 --> 07:45.023
Just tell the Captain I made you do it.

07:45.025 --> 07:46.591
What?

07:47.893 --> 07:48.993
Sorry, Earl.

07:55.769 --> 07:58.036
Um... e-excuse me?

07:58.038 --> 07:59.771
Scott, don't talk.

07:59.773 --> 08:01.906
I just want to ask him not
to point that gun at us.

08:01.908 --> 08:03.908
We hit a bump, it could go off.

08:03.910 --> 08:05.610
It won't go off.

08:05.612 --> 08:06.978
That's a Taurus 9-millimeter,

08:06.980 --> 08:08.613
17-shot-capacity magazine.

08:08.615 --> 08:09.981
And a hair trigger.

08:09.983 --> 08:13.751
So Bruce Lee does know his guns.

08:13.753 --> 08:15.720
I'm just saying, we could hit a
bump or a pothole or something.

08:15.722 --> 08:18.823
Maybe I don't care if we hit a pothole.

08:18.825 --> 08:20.725
Maybe...

08:20.727 --> 08:22.961
I'm hoping we hit 17 potholes

08:22.963 --> 08:26.030
so I can empty this entire mag
in that smartass mug of yours.

08:26.032 --> 08:28.800
Did you ever consider that, Tokyo Drift?

08:28.802 --> 08:32.804
I'm Chinese.

08:32.806 --> 08:35.607
And so is Bruce Lee.

08:52.359 --> 08:54.058
What's going on back there?

09:02.567 --> 09:04.535
And we'll just work harder...

09:04.537 --> 09:06.403
Pray harder.

09:06.405 --> 09:07.605
I'm done praying.

09:07.607 --> 09:09.473
Well, then what do you want to do?

09:09.475 --> 09:11.909
You want to get in a room with a shrink?

09:11.911 --> 09:13.477
I don't want help anymore.

09:13.479 --> 09:15.146
What are you talking about?

09:15.148 --> 09:16.713
You've been pushing me for that for years.

09:16.715 --> 09:18.148
I want out.

09:18.150 --> 09:22.353
You can't put everything in God's hands.

09:22.355 --> 09:23.554
What if we just leave?

09:23.556 --> 09:25.890
We take the kids and move.

09:25.892 --> 09:28.492
W-we got to a whole new place.

09:28.494 --> 09:29.927
Whole change of scenery.

09:29.929 --> 09:33.364
Scenery's the only thing
that's gonna change.

09:36.368 --> 09:39.370
I know. What if we go to Mexico, huh?

09:39.372 --> 09:40.638
What if we go to Mexico

09:40.640 --> 09:42.439
and we hike up that trail on Mount Ajusco?

09:42.441 --> 09:43.908
Remember that?

09:43.910 --> 09:45.543
We were sweating our butts off one minute.

09:45.545 --> 09:48.245
We were throwing snowballs
at each other the next?

09:51.250 --> 09:54.218
That was our moment, wasn't it?

09:54.220 --> 09:55.953
Yeah, it was.

09:55.955 --> 09:58.389
Then that's what we'll do.

09:58.391 --> 10:01.692
We'll just sell the house,
and we'll pack the kids up,

10:01.694 --> 10:04.328
and we'll just go.

10:06.531 --> 10:08.332
The lord will show us the way.

10:14.606 --> 10:15.606
- Jennifer!
- No!

10:17.410 --> 10:19.610
- Get in here!
- Let me go!

10:31.289 --> 10:33.691
Hey! Come here!

10:33.693 --> 10:36.327
They're not what they seem.
They... they're dangerous.

10:36.329 --> 10:38.362
"They're not what they seem"?

10:38.364 --> 10:40.398
Richard, what the hell is
going on with you?

10:41.300 --> 10:44.001
Now, you were firing on all
cylinders back at the motel.

10:44.003 --> 10:45.302
If you come apart on me
now, I swear to God...

10:45.304 --> 10:46.570
Look, I'm trying to save us.

10:46.572 --> 10:49.240
I know what they really are. I can tell.

10:49.242 --> 10:51.775
- What the hell do you mean you can tell?
- I can just tell.

10:51.777 --> 10:54.345
Look, I don't want to have to do this,

10:54.347 --> 10:56.480
but I'm gonna have to kill
'em, okay? It's the only way.

10:56.482 --> 10:59.583
Hey, Richard. Just talk to me, buddy.

10:59.585 --> 11:02.019
Explain it to me, all right?
Just tell me what's going on.

11:05.557 --> 11:06.657
Okay.

11:06.659 --> 11:08.592
All right?

11:08.594 --> 11:10.494
Kate.

11:10.496 --> 11:12.596
What?!

11:12.598 --> 11:17.468
Don't say anything. Just look.

11:18.403 --> 11:20.738
Okay, for a while now, I've
been getting these... signals,

11:20.740 --> 11:22.740
I guess you could call them.

11:22.742 --> 11:24.608
I didn't really know what to
make of them until she came along.

11:24.610 --> 11:25.809
She?

11:25.811 --> 11:28.012
Yeah, she's the reason I know
what Jacob and Scott really are.

11:28.014 --> 11:29.513
She's been calling me, Seth.

11:29.515 --> 11:31.415
She's been calling me to the other side.

11:31.417 --> 11:32.549
Who?

11:32.551 --> 11:34.285
I-I don't know her name.

11:34.287 --> 11:35.719
She's like a Goddess or something.

11:35.721 --> 11:38.289
I-I usually only see her in reflections.

11:38.291 --> 11:40.491
I saw her in the refrigerator
at the liquor store

11:40.493 --> 11:42.726
and then in the safe at the bank,

11:42.728 --> 11:45.128
and then one time I saw her
through the hole in my hand.

11:45.130 --> 11:49.333
Wait a minute. You saw her in your hand?

11:49.335 --> 11:52.036
Yeah. Right now I just saw her.

11:52.038 --> 11:53.537
You know, she's probably still watching.

11:53.539 --> 11:55.606
She's the one who's been
calling me to Mexico.

12:00.745 --> 12:02.079
Scott!

12:02.081 --> 12:03.380
Where... where did you get that?

12:04.784 --> 12:07.384
If those two assholes were
holding lacrosse sticks,

12:07.386 --> 12:08.652
it'd be just like third period.

12:08.654 --> 12:10.354
You brought that to school?

12:10.356 --> 12:11.588
No, but guys like that

12:11.590 --> 12:13.390
need to be reminded that power shifts.

12:13.392 --> 12:14.825
And as soon as I get the chance,

12:14.827 --> 12:16.627
I'm gonna shift it right
up that whack job's ass.

12:16.629 --> 12:17.828
Scott, don't.

12:17.830 --> 12:18.829
- I have to do something.
- No.

12:18.831 --> 12:19.897
You think Dad's gonna?

12:22.434 --> 12:24.668
You don't know what Dad's capable of.

12:24.670 --> 12:27.338
What the hell's that supposed to mean?

12:29.107 --> 12:31.375
That's why I know about them.
She told me to look, Seth.

12:31.377 --> 12:32.576
So that's what I did.

12:32.578 --> 12:34.545
What did you see?

12:34.547 --> 12:37.114
Well...

12:37.116 --> 12:39.750
You see the old man?

12:39.752 --> 12:42.419
He's really a demon.

12:42.421 --> 12:44.488
He's got fangs and claws

12:44.490 --> 12:46.390
and slime in his teeth and shit.

12:46.392 --> 12:48.692
And that kid?

12:48.694 --> 12:50.661
Kid's got a tail.

12:50.663 --> 12:52.663
You remember Monica, the bank teller?

12:52.665 --> 12:54.765
She was gonna shoot me, Seth.

12:54.767 --> 12:56.367
And the Goddess told me about that, too,

12:56.369 --> 12:57.735
and that's why I had to sacrifice her.

12:57.737 --> 12:59.536
You see, there's something
bigger going on here.

12:59.538 --> 13:01.505
Do you understand what
I'm saying to you? Do you?

13:02.540 --> 13:04.808
Yeah. And... and, hey, listen.

13:06.444 --> 13:09.680
- Richie, you're right.
- What?

13:09.682 --> 13:11.448
Something's been off about
this whole thing, okay?

13:11.450 --> 13:12.783
I can sense it, too.

13:12.785 --> 13:15.119
The trouble is, I'm not as
tuned into it as you are.

13:15.121 --> 13:20.457
I mean, come on, buddy. Cut
me some slack here, okay?

13:20.459 --> 13:21.759
I can be a downright
stubborn son of a bitch

13:21.761 --> 13:23.494
when it comes to admitting I'm wrong.

13:23.496 --> 13:25.929
I-I guess it's just 'cause you're...

13:25.931 --> 13:28.899
You're my brother, you know.

13:28.901 --> 13:31.135
What?

13:31.137 --> 13:34.571
I just... I never want
to admit that you're...

13:34.573 --> 13:37.141
That you're right, you know?

13:37.143 --> 13:38.942
But when you're right, you're right.

13:40.178 --> 13:42.679
You always have been
the smarter one, Richard.

13:48.754 --> 13:51.522
What the hell are you doing, padre?!

13:51.524 --> 13:53.190
We're here.

13:58.164 --> 14:00.864
All right, buddy. Game time.

14:00.866 --> 14:01.965
Now, you got your balls on?

14:01.967 --> 14:03.634
- Screwed on tight.
- Okay.

14:03.636 --> 14:07.438
Now, you go keep an eye on them.

14:07.440 --> 14:08.806
Don't do anything yet.

14:08.808 --> 14:11.675
Not till we cross, okay?

14:22.188 --> 14:24.555
They can go.

14:29.561 --> 14:30.994
You're not just gonna stand there, are you?

14:30.996 --> 14:32.996
Huh?

14:32.998 --> 14:35.766
You know, they could board
us randomly at any time.

14:35.768 --> 14:38.235
We were gonna hide.

14:38.237 --> 14:40.637
That was the plan, soon
as we get a little closer.

14:40.639 --> 14:42.673
Your brother's not well, is he?

14:42.675 --> 14:44.741
Just keep driving, padre.

14:44.743 --> 14:46.944
Is that why you're going to Mexico?

14:48.914 --> 14:50.881
You know, a life of
looking over his shoulder

14:50.883 --> 14:52.549
isn't gonna bring him any peace.

14:52.551 --> 14:54.251
Yeah, well, where we're going,

14:54.253 --> 14:56.553
the ends more than justify the means.

14:56.555 --> 14:58.989
Place makes club med look like Haiti.

14:58.991 --> 15:00.757
$10 million means

15:00.759 --> 15:02.826
never having to look over
your shoulder again... ever.

15:02.828 --> 15:04.895
Sounds like heaven on earth.

15:04.897 --> 15:06.563
Well, I hear it is.

15:06.565 --> 15:07.698
Doesn't exist.

15:17.243 --> 15:20.611
So, where is Mrs. Jacob, anyway?

15:22.013 --> 15:23.947
She run out on you?

15:23.949 --> 15:26.517
Lord called her home six months ago.

15:26.519 --> 15:27.985
She was young.

15:27.987 --> 15:29.553
What? Cancer?

15:29.555 --> 15:31.688
- Car accident.
- Phew.

15:31.690 --> 15:32.990
No wonder you don't
believe in heaven anymore.

15:32.992 --> 15:35.259
I don't know how you could keep your faith

15:35.261 --> 15:37.895
in the man upstairs
after something like that.

15:37.897 --> 15:40.264
But you do believe in his judgment, though,

15:40.266 --> 15:42.933
don't you, padre?

15:42.935 --> 15:47.070
I mean, you believe that, uh,
all this was supposed to happen.

15:47.072 --> 15:51.008
You also believe that your
wife was supposed to die?

15:51.010 --> 15:53.610
Well, I guess it makes it
easy in that case, right?

15:54.812 --> 15:56.647
Just let Jesus take the wheel and all that?

15:58.316 --> 16:00.851
Except he's not a very good driver.

16:12.698 --> 16:13.864
Can I ask you something?

16:16.301 --> 16:20.904
That stuff you said by the pool...

16:20.906 --> 16:22.806
How did you know all that?

16:22.808 --> 16:26.710
About me, about my mom?

16:26.712 --> 16:30.581
Well, like I said, I can see things.

16:33.585 --> 16:36.119
Did you ever think it might be God

16:36.121 --> 16:37.721
trying to communicate with you?

16:37.723 --> 16:38.922
It's not God.

16:38.924 --> 16:40.924
Do you know the story of Moses?

16:40.926 --> 16:42.025
I know the Chuck Heston version,

16:42.027 --> 16:43.794
which is the only one that counts.

16:43.796 --> 16:47.130
Well, Moses didn't believe, either.

16:47.132 --> 16:49.600
Not until God spoke to him.

16:50.935 --> 16:53.136
God might make his message clearer...

16:54.672 --> 16:55.906
If you pray.

17:01.346 --> 17:03.680
Close your eyes.

17:03.682 --> 17:05.348
I don't think so.

17:05.351 --> 17:08.618
I promise it won't hurt.

17:29.407 --> 17:33.844
Our lord, who art in heaven,
hallowed be your name.

17:33.846 --> 17:35.979
Your kingdom come, your
will be done on earth,

17:35.981 --> 17:38.015
as it is in heaven.

17:38.017 --> 17:40.751
Give us this day our daily bread,

17:40.753 --> 17:44.855
and forgive us our debts as we
also have forgiven our debtors.

17:44.857 --> 17:47.057
Lead us not into temptation...

17:47.059 --> 17:49.159
...But deliver us from evil.

17:49.161 --> 17:52.029
Richard.

17:52.031 --> 17:54.031
I'm waiting for you.

17:54.033 --> 17:56.133
Don't let them stop you.

17:59.737 --> 18:01.772
Seth.

18:03.741 --> 18:05.042
Kate, grab his gun.

18:05.977 --> 18:08.078
Don't do it, Kate. You're not like them.

18:08.080 --> 18:09.413
Just do it.

18:09.415 --> 18:11.415
I'll put one in your pretty head

18:11.417 --> 18:12.949
before you ever touch the grip, sweetheart.

18:12.951 --> 18:15.786
As for you, you take
that gun off my brother

18:15.788 --> 18:16.953
before the ounce of forgiveness

18:16.955 --> 18:18.455
that I have on reserve goes the way...

18:18.457 --> 18:20.090
Back off!

18:22.161 --> 18:23.694
Back up.

18:24.462 --> 18:25.762
Back, back.

18:25.764 --> 18:27.230
Drop it.

18:27.232 --> 18:29.900
Get in the driver's
seat! Drive! Keep moving!

18:29.902 --> 18:32.002
I told you, Seth. I told you.
Just shoot this kid in the head.

18:32.004 --> 18:34.104
Richie. Richie, relax. I got this.

18:34.106 --> 18:35.472
Hey, padre.

18:35.474 --> 18:37.207
Why don't you talk some sense into your son

18:37.209 --> 18:38.709
before I have to take my brother's advice?

18:38.711 --> 18:40.010
Son, put the gun down!

18:40.012 --> 18:42.879
- Dad, this is bullshit!
- I know how you feel!

18:42.881 --> 18:44.448
You want to protect the
family, but this isn't the way!

18:44.450 --> 18:46.450
They're bullies and they're assholes,

18:46.452 --> 18:47.951
and they don't deserve to win.

18:47.953 --> 18:49.252
As soon as we get across that border,

18:49.254 --> 18:51.788
they're gonna bury us in the desert.

18:51.790 --> 18:54.224
And I know you think I can't do it.

18:54.226 --> 18:57.160
- But I can.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

18:57.162 --> 19:00.997
Now, I know that you
thought you could. I do.

19:00.999 --> 19:02.999
But that was before you had
your finger on the trigger,

19:03.001 --> 19:04.000
wasn't it?

19:04.002 --> 19:05.135
You see, now that you do,

19:05.137 --> 19:07.003
you're worried about the consequences,

19:07.005 --> 19:09.005
whereas I am not.

19:09.007 --> 19:11.475
That's why your hand's shaking
and mine's steady as a rock.

19:11.477 --> 19:14.244
Because you're not like me, Scott.

19:14.246 --> 19:16.279
And you don't want to be.

19:27.492 --> 19:29.493
That's it. That's it.

19:29.495 --> 19:30.894
There you go.

19:34.533 --> 19:36.500
- Richie, no!
- I have to do this, Seth!

19:36.502 --> 19:37.901
- This has to happen!
- Enough!

19:42.307 --> 19:43.774
Sit your ass down!

19:44.810 --> 19:46.510
Give me that. Stay!

19:49.981 --> 19:52.082
What the hell did you do?

19:52.084 --> 19:54.785
My foot slipped. What did you expect?

19:54.787 --> 19:56.319
Hey! Where the hell do
you think you're going?

19:56.321 --> 19:59.222
Are you gonna go out there?

19:59.224 --> 20:00.891
Hey.

20:00.893 --> 20:02.893
You so much as scratch
your nose or tug your ear,

20:02.895 --> 20:04.995
my brother gets his gun back, okay?

20:04.997 --> 20:07.531
Got it? Move.

20:12.837 --> 20:16.006
What the hell's wrong with you?!

20:16.008 --> 20:19.242
Pastor Jacob Fuller, bethel baptist.

20:19.244 --> 20:21.278
Uh, my apologies.

20:21.280 --> 20:24.147
My foot came off the
brake for just one second.

20:24.149 --> 20:25.849
Pastor, I am...

20:25.851 --> 20:27.284
My mama would have my hide

20:27.286 --> 20:29.553
if she knew I was mouthing
off to a man of the cloth.

20:29.555 --> 20:31.555
Look, between the heat and the gridlock

20:31.557 --> 20:34.057
I'm sorry. I just...
I get really worked up.

20:34.059 --> 20:35.358
Well, not to worry.

20:35.360 --> 20:38.295
It, uh, looks like this,
uh, damage isn't too bad,

20:38.297 --> 20:41.298
so, uh, we can "vayas con dios," right?

20:41.300 --> 20:44.301
Maybe if it was just me,
but this is a company car,

20:44.303 --> 20:46.169
and if I show up with as
little as a scuff on it,

20:46.171 --> 20:47.871
our fleet manager's gonna be upset,

20:47.873 --> 20:49.172
and it looks like you guys have a-a ding

20:49.174 --> 20:50.307
on the Fender right here, too.

20:50.309 --> 20:52.909
So we should exchange information.

20:52.911 --> 20:54.344
Well, I could give you my phone number.

20:54.346 --> 20:56.346
What about insurance?

20:56.348 --> 20:59.015
My insurance card's in there, and...

20:59.017 --> 21:00.317
Okay, well, go ahead and
scrounge around for it,

21:00.319 --> 21:02.085
and I'll just snap some pics, okay?

21:02.087 --> 21:04.287
You know, I really
don't have time for this.

21:04.289 --> 21:05.589
No, it'll be no problem at all.

21:05.591 --> 21:07.057
I'll shoot them right over to you.

21:07.059 --> 21:08.258
Uh, better yet, why
don't you guys pull over?

21:08.260 --> 21:11.161
I'll just flag down an officer and go...

21:11.163 --> 21:14.631
Thought you were a past...

21:14.633 --> 21:16.299
Old Testament.

21:19.527 --> 21:21.428
What a fantastic idea. Let's
bring another hostage on board.

21:21.430 --> 21:24.397
You're not helping.

21:24.399 --> 21:25.932
What the hell were you thinking?

21:25.934 --> 21:27.734
People are getting angry out
there. Police are gonna notice.

21:27.736 --> 21:29.736
Really? Well, thank you
for stating the obvious.

21:29.738 --> 21:30.870
Hey, don't yell at her. It's not her fault.

21:30.895 --> 21:32.895
Everybody shut up!

21:33.574 --> 21:36.643
Now, all we got to do is
move the man's car forward.

21:36.645 --> 21:38.445
So, you're calling the shots now?

21:38.447 --> 21:40.513
Well, I don't see you coming
up with any bright ideas.

21:41.182 --> 21:42.615
I-I'll move his car forward.

21:43.551 --> 21:44.651
That won't work.

21:44.653 --> 21:45.718
Why not?

21:45.720 --> 21:47.353
I'm sorry, Katey-kakes,

21:47.355 --> 21:49.055
but lying isn't your strong suit.

21:49.057 --> 21:50.323
Well, then maybe you should do it.

21:50.325 --> 21:52.224
What's that supposed to mean?

21:54.027 --> 21:56.662
Scott, you're gonna drive the car.

21:56.664 --> 21:57.697
Me?

21:57.699 --> 21:59.265
Him? Oh, that's fantastic.

21:59.267 --> 22:01.968
Why don't we just throw the
cuffs on right now, then?

22:01.970 --> 22:03.336
It's the only way.

22:03.338 --> 22:06.038
I have to drive the R.V.,
or it'll look suspicious.

22:06.040 --> 22:07.940
And you two trigger-happy bastards

22:07.942 --> 22:10.109
have your faces plastered
all over the state,

22:10.111 --> 22:13.312
so unless you want to answer
the officer's questions,

22:13.314 --> 22:15.281
Scott's our guy.

22:19.615 --> 22:21.115
_

22:21.140 --> 22:23.140
_

22:23.165 --> 22:24.865
_

22:25.285 --> 22:27.285
_

22:28.285 --> 22:30.485
_

22:30.510 --> 22:32.010
_

22:33.036 --> 22:34.536
_

22:34.598 --> 22:36.298
_

22:36.323 --> 22:38.023
_

22:38.048 --> 22:40.048
_

22:41.109 --> 22:42.341
Officer Torres,

22:42.343 --> 22:44.076
I have a Captain Holbrook from the Rangers

22:44.078 --> 22:45.177
on line one for you.

22:45.179 --> 22:46.779
He says it's urgent.

22:49.116 --> 22:51.717
Captain Holbrook, how can I help you?

22:51.719 --> 22:54.020
Uh, Ranger Gonzalez? No.

22:54.022 --> 22:56.188
I haven't seen him come
through here yet, no.

22:56.190 --> 22:58.124
Let's go, sir! Hey, hey!

22:58.126 --> 23:01.694
Let's go!

23:01.696 --> 23:04.664
Carlos.

23:27.788 --> 23:29.155
Don't worry.

23:29.157 --> 23:30.490
As soon as I let them know what's up,

23:30.492 --> 23:32.158
they're gonna get you and
Kate out of there, okay?

23:32.160 --> 23:34.093
- What?
- This is our last chance, Dad.

23:34.095 --> 23:35.728
Isn't that why you picked me to drive?

23:35.730 --> 23:38.130
No, that's not. And where
did you get that gun?

23:38.132 --> 23:40.066
It doesn't matter. I was trying to save us.

23:40.068 --> 23:41.434
Well, you almost got us killed.

23:41.436 --> 23:43.703
At least I did something.

23:45.038 --> 23:46.372
Listen to me.

23:46.374 --> 23:48.240
You get in that car, you
show the man your passport,

23:48.242 --> 23:50.276
and get through to the other side.

23:51.813 --> 23:53.312
I love you.

24:13.066 --> 24:14.400
Oh, you got to be kidding me.

24:15.403 --> 24:17.069
Ranger Gonzalez.

24:17.071 --> 24:19.105
I need you to holster
that weapon for me, sir.

24:19.107 --> 24:20.372
Look, I don't mean to cause a panic,

24:20.374 --> 24:22.274
but the Gecko brothers might be in that R.V.

24:22.276 --> 24:24.443
Need you to holster that weapon, sir.

24:25.378 --> 24:27.813
They've killed civilians and officers.

24:27.815 --> 24:29.315
They're armed and extremely dangerous.

24:29.317 --> 24:31.383
If we don't stop them and
they get across that border,

24:31.385 --> 24:32.885
more innocent people are gonna die.

24:32.887 --> 24:34.286
Not gonna ask again.

24:41.528 --> 24:43.095
Let's go.

24:43.097 --> 24:44.897
You can speak to Captain Holbrook about it.

24:50.303 --> 24:52.271
Please say a command.

24:52.273 --> 24:56.175
Play artist Castle of Genre.

24:56.177 --> 24:59.478
Now playing artist Castle of Genre.

25:01.449 --> 25:03.349
Let's go.

25:03.351 --> 25:04.383
You...

25:04.385 --> 25:05.518
You can do this.

25:05.520 --> 25:07.186
You can do this.

25:11.892 --> 25:13.192
Hi.

25:13.194 --> 25:15.795
What's your purpose in Mexico?

25:15.797 --> 25:17.797
Purpose?

25:17.799 --> 25:18.931
Why are you going?

25:18.933 --> 25:20.266
Oh, yeah.

25:24.538 --> 25:27.540
I'm part of this Christian-ministry group,

25:27.542 --> 25:28.841
helping hands.

25:28.843 --> 25:30.543
We build homes and stuff

25:30.545 --> 25:33.345
for, like, you know, the homeless.

25:35.515 --> 25:37.349
Thank you.

25:39.252 --> 25:40.352
Not so fast.

25:45.559 --> 25:48.327
Have you seen these two?

25:48.329 --> 25:49.829
Uh...

25:52.432 --> 25:54.466
No, uh, I-I don't...

25:54.468 --> 25:55.434
No.

25:57.270 --> 25:58.337
Thank you.

25:58.339 --> 25:59.572
Something you want to tell me?

25:59.574 --> 26:02.241
Uh...

26:03.577 --> 26:05.477
Let's go ahead and step
out of the car, sir.

26:05.479 --> 26:07.546
Yeah.

26:12.854 --> 26:14.486
Damn it.

26:14.488 --> 26:16.288
- Damn it!
- You see? What did I tell you?

26:16.290 --> 26:18.257
He planned this. He wanted
the kid to get caught.

26:18.259 --> 26:20.459
- No, no, no, that's not true.
- All right, just calm down, Richard.

26:20.461 --> 26:22.261
Why would I want my own son to get caught?

26:22.263 --> 26:24.330
To rat us out. In your mind,
he's safe and we're screwed.

26:24.332 --> 26:25.531
Seth, give me my gun.

26:25.533 --> 26:27.867
- Is my brother telling the truth?
- No.

26:27.869 --> 26:29.368
Seth, this is a man
who killed his own wife.

26:29.370 --> 26:30.202
Excuse me?

26:30.204 --> 26:31.403
She told me.

26:31.405 --> 26:32.605
Is that what you think, Katey-kakes?

26:32.607 --> 26:34.306
I didn't tell him anything. He's insane.

26:34.308 --> 26:35.307
No, I'm not.

26:35.309 --> 26:36.208
Just what is it exactly

26:36.210 --> 26:37.610
you think you know?

26:37.612 --> 26:39.345
- I know what you really are.
- All right, all right.

26:39.347 --> 26:40.412
Hey!

26:40.414 --> 26:42.548
Enough!

26:42.550 --> 26:44.350
Pigs got your son.

26:44.352 --> 26:46.585
You make one more wrong
move, I take your daughter.

26:46.587 --> 26:48.320
Whatever your brother told you was wrong.

26:48.322 --> 26:51.357
Don't let him make you
doubt yourself... not now.

26:51.359 --> 26:53.525
In fact, if any of us, including me,

26:53.527 --> 26:55.961
makes a stupid move, we're all dead.

26:55.963 --> 26:58.330
And we've just got to stick to the plan.

26:58.332 --> 27:00.332
It'll work if we do.

27:00.334 --> 27:01.967
Yeah? Well, you better hope it does.

27:14.347 --> 27:16.448
What's your purpose in Mexico?

27:16.450 --> 27:19.318
Family vacation.

27:21.021 --> 27:23.355
After everything I told
you? After he hit me?

27:23.357 --> 27:24.657
Look, I told you, I got this.

27:24.659 --> 27:26.358
You don't have shit, Seth. You never have.

27:26.360 --> 27:27.493
Richie, be quiet.

27:27.495 --> 27:29.261
- How many with you?
- Me and my daughter.

27:29.263 --> 27:31.363
Can she step forward, please?

27:31.365 --> 27:33.365
If it's, uh, absolutely necessary.

27:33.367 --> 27:35.567
She's a little under the weather,

27:35.569 --> 27:37.269
and she's sleeping it off right now.

27:37.271 --> 27:38.938
This trip has taken its toll on her.

27:40.674 --> 27:43.275
Look, if I don't kill everybody in
here, we are never gonna make it.

27:43.277 --> 27:44.710
Well, maybe that's what
the voices are telling you,

27:44.712 --> 27:46.512
but they're not calling
the shots right now, okay?

27:46.514 --> 27:48.480
So shut up.

27:54.688 --> 27:56.655
Thank you.

27:58.291 --> 28:00.359
Have you seen these boys?

28:00.361 --> 28:02.728
Can't say that I have.

28:02.730 --> 28:04.063
You don't believe me.

28:04.065 --> 28:05.364
I knew it.

28:05.366 --> 28:06.565
Richard, now is not the time.

28:06.567 --> 28:08.100
I have to finish this.

28:11.038 --> 28:13.372
What was that?

28:13.374 --> 28:16.308
Uh, that's my daughter.
She's in the bathroom.

28:16.310 --> 28:18.110
I thought you said she was asleep?

28:18.112 --> 28:20.112
Nature calls.

28:21.081 --> 28:23.682
I'm coming aboard, sir.

28:23.684 --> 28:25.117
Okay.

28:41.534 --> 28:43.469
Sir, I need you to open up.

28:43.471 --> 28:45.337
Oh, son of a bitch.

28:45.339 --> 28:46.672
If you still believe in that God of yours,

28:46.674 --> 28:48.140
now would be a good time to call him.

28:52.479 --> 28:53.612
Hi.

28:53.614 --> 28:55.214
Sorry. Come on in.

28:59.085 --> 29:00.386
That your daughter?

29:00.388 --> 29:01.787
Yes, ma'am.

29:01.789 --> 29:05.691
Though I wouldn't poke the
bear unless you... need to.

29:31.551 --> 29:33.118
Officer Torres,

29:33.120 --> 29:35.187
I have a Captain Holbrook from the Rangers

29:35.189 --> 29:36.255
on line one for you.

29:36.257 --> 29:38.457
He says it's urgent.

29:38.459 --> 29:41.193
Captain Holbrook, how can I help you?

29:44.231 --> 29:46.565
Uh, Ranger Gonzalez? No.

29:46.567 --> 29:48.801
I haven't seen him come
through here yet, no.

29:48.803 --> 29:51.470
Yeah, I'll take care
of it. I'd be happy to.

29:51.472 --> 29:53.605
I'll keep you posted, and, you know,

29:53.607 --> 29:55.541
I'll have our guys look out for him

29:55.543 --> 29:57.543
and if they find him, I will call you.

29:57.545 --> 30:00.079
Any time. Sure.

30:56.636 --> 30:59.138
Ranger Gonzalez.

30:59.139 --> 31:00.773
I need you to holster your weapon.

31:00.775 --> 31:01.974
Look, I don't mean to cause a panic,

31:01.976 --> 31:03.843
but the Gecko brothers
might be in that R.V.

31:03.845 --> 31:05.778
I need you to holster that.

31:05.780 --> 31:09.415
And you help me make that bust,

31:09.417 --> 31:11.817
that could earn you a sweet promotion.

31:13.987 --> 31:16.789
And bringing down a major cartel?

31:16.791 --> 31:18.190
That can get you a shiny new star.

31:20.894 --> 31:22.995
What about a cartel?

31:22.997 --> 31:24.964
The Gecko brothers aren't just thieves.

31:24.966 --> 31:26.732
I think one of them's a hit man

31:26.734 --> 31:29.001
that works for somebody named
Carlos in the culebras cartel.

31:29.003 --> 31:31.837
- Man, you must have heard of him.
- I have.

31:31.839 --> 31:33.406
It's the same guy the
D.E.A.'s been trying to build

31:33.408 --> 31:35.941
a case against for drug
smuggling, human trafficking.

31:35.943 --> 31:37.677
Right.

31:37.679 --> 31:39.879
We think he's responsible
for the death of an informant.

31:39.881 --> 31:41.714
I'm sure.

31:53.694 --> 31:55.828
And how did you pick up on his scent?

31:57.431 --> 31:59.231
Good detective work.

32:01.468 --> 32:03.035
And Google.

32:03.037 --> 32:04.870
And Google.

32:04.872 --> 32:06.038
You must be a pretty good Ranger

32:06.040 --> 32:07.840
to put all that together on your own.

32:07.842 --> 32:11.444
Sounds like your fellow
rinches don't believe you.

32:11.446 --> 32:13.179
One ride, one Ranger.

32:13.181 --> 32:16.782
One ride, one Ranger.

32:16.784 --> 32:19.018
So, what do you say?

32:19.020 --> 32:21.253
In there.

32:23.056 --> 32:25.958
Let's stop that R.V. right here and now.

32:30.831 --> 32:32.264
Yeah.

32:34.201 --> 32:36.836
If it were only that simple.

32:42.743 --> 32:45.845
Hey, watch the door. Don't let him leave.

32:51.185 --> 32:52.885
I can explain.

32:52.887 --> 32:55.788
And how would you do that, huh?

32:55.790 --> 32:57.289
By giving up Seth and Richie?

32:59.226 --> 33:01.327
What are you talking about?

33:03.163 --> 33:05.131
Good boy.

33:05.133 --> 33:07.032
Let's go.

33:12.506 --> 33:14.774
What?

33:14.776 --> 33:16.842
I am glad I'm not on your lacrosse team.

33:18.212 --> 33:19.545
Hi.

33:19.547 --> 33:20.412
Sorry. Come on in.

33:24.851 --> 33:26.051
That your daughter?

33:26.053 --> 33:27.820
Yes, ma'am.

33:27.822 --> 33:30.923
Though I wouldn't poke the
bear unless you... need to.

34:11.031 --> 34:13.899
Kadner, you're needed inside.

34:13.900 --> 34:15.568
Some detainee is taking a stand.

34:15.570 --> 34:17.168
I didn't hear that on the radio.

34:17.170 --> 34:19.071
Well, you're hearing it now.

34:19.072 --> 34:21.873
Copy that.

34:27.848 --> 34:30.049
You're free to go.

34:30.051 --> 34:32.150
You still want to cut
that commission, Seth?

34:32.152 --> 34:35.987
Drive across the last
checkpoint and you're home free.

34:46.299 --> 34:48.132
Kate.

34:52.973 --> 34:54.473
Smooth sailing. Come on.

35:45.426 --> 35:47.226
Don't move!

36:20.394 --> 36:22.328
Jenny.

36:22.330 --> 36:24.063
Jenny, don't leave me.

36:24.065 --> 36:27.366
Jenny, stay with me.

36:27.368 --> 36:29.501
Don't leave me. Don't leave me.

36:31.706 --> 36:33.172
Huh?

36:33.174 --> 36:34.206
Jenny.

36:34.208 --> 36:36.442
What happened?

36:36.444 --> 36:39.278
We've been in an accident.
We've been in an accident.

36:39.280 --> 36:41.246
- Oh.
- We're gonna be fine.

36:41.248 --> 36:44.049
Oh. God's with us now,
like I knew he would be.

36:44.051 --> 36:45.985
I knew it.

36:45.987 --> 36:48.020
I love you, Jennifer.

36:48.022 --> 36:49.989
I love you.

37:07.073 --> 37:09.508
Oh, I'm not ready.

37:09.510 --> 37:11.743
I'm the one who failed, not her.

37:11.745 --> 37:13.345
Please, take me instead.

37:13.347 --> 37:15.481
It's my fault.

37:15.483 --> 37:17.149
It's my fault, God.

37:17.151 --> 37:19.485
If my devotion to you has meant anything,

37:19.487 --> 37:22.154
you'll do this one thing.

37:22.156 --> 37:23.489
You'll do this one thing.

37:23.491 --> 37:25.524
Please.

37:30.497 --> 37:34.266
She can't die yet. You can't have her.

37:34.268 --> 37:38.504
If you're owed a soul, take mine.

37:38.506 --> 37:41.073
Take mine!

37:44.511 --> 37:47.513
You son of a bitch!

37:47.515 --> 37:51.083
You son of a bitch!

37:51.085 --> 37:55.454
There was no animal on the road that night.

37:55.456 --> 37:57.222
There was no migraine.

37:57.224 --> 37:59.391
Your mother and I had been fighting,

37:59.393 --> 38:01.393
and I lost control of the car.

38:01.395 --> 38:03.796
Our marriage was in trouble.

38:03.798 --> 38:06.799
There was a chance to save it,
but I wouldn't get any help...

38:06.801 --> 38:09.101
Any real help.

38:09.103 --> 38:11.103
You're right, Kate.

38:11.105 --> 38:13.472
I been lying to you.

38:15.809 --> 38:17.409
And lying to myself.

38:17.411 --> 38:21.213
But there ain't no running
away from what happened.

38:21.215 --> 38:24.483
I put everything in God's hands.

38:28.254 --> 38:30.456
And your mama, she paid the price.

38:30.458 --> 38:33.859
Maybe a stronger man
would've turned to his faith

38:33.861 --> 38:35.427
to get him through today.

38:35.429 --> 38:40.332
The thought of looking to
Jesus just made me resent

38:40.334 --> 38:43.202
all those years I'd
spent praising his name.

38:46.573 --> 38:49.108
Forgive me.

39:11.264 --> 39:13.265
When do we move?

39:13.267 --> 39:15.567
As soon as El Jefe give us the word.

39:46.499 --> 39:49.333
Come on, come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on, come on.

39:54.207 --> 39:55.274
Who the hell are you?

39:58.645 --> 40:00.179
Carlos.

40:17.297 --> 40:18.830
Move, move!

40:23.436 --> 40:25.236
We got a man down!

40:59.772 --> 41:01.906
Hey, you, get back here!

41:03.275 --> 41:05.210
Yes!

41:05.212 --> 41:07.479
That's what I'm talking about!

41:07.481 --> 41:08.847
Teamwork!

41:12.251 --> 41:14.018
Where's my car?

41:41.981 --> 41:44.382
Sorry, Earl.

42:43.042 --> 42:45.944
You know, you handled yourself
pretty well back there, Jake.

42:45.946 --> 42:47.612
Told you we'd get across.

42:47.614 --> 42:49.380
Now you keep up your end.

42:55.322 --> 42:56.588
Richie, come on. Wake up.

42:56.590 --> 42:59.190
Wake up! Come on, buddy.

42:59.192 --> 43:01.259
We made it. We're in Mexico.

43:14.607 --> 43:16.908
How are you feeling, brother?

43:16.910 --> 43:19.344
Never been better.
