00:01.034 --> 00:07.607
reads words on screen

00:10.009 --> 00:13.380
<i>Tonight, on Bachelor in
Paradise Canada...</i>

00:15.348 --> 00:18.618
I wanted to celebrate your
arrivals with a Camp Paradise

00:18.685 --> 00:20.954
Sadie Hawkins dance.

00:23.423 --> 00:25.925
Tonight, we're a big
make out party.

00:25.992 --> 00:27.660
Lot more girls than
guys here so,

00:27.727 --> 00:30.630
it's kind of gonna be an
awkward situation.

00:30.697 --> 00:32.599
Can I step out of the dance?

00:32.665 --> 00:34.601
Can you step out of the dance?

00:36.836 --> 00:38.705
What's up!

00:38.772 --> 00:39.672
What?

00:39.739 --> 00:42.275
- There's a new guy.
- What's up, bro?

00:42.342 --> 00:44.377
This guy did something
just so gross.

00:44.444 --> 00:45.812
Yeah, somebody I hate, ew.

00:45.879 --> 00:48.715
I actually used to see
Lisa for a little bit.

00:48.782 --> 00:51.317
I'm wondering if you want to
just have a private chat?

00:51.384 --> 00:52.819
It makes me not trust anybody.

00:52.886 --> 00:55.021
It's too little too late.

00:55.088 --> 00:59.259
I'm having my heart sort of
broken right in front of me.

00:59.325 --> 01:03.930
I've had so many things taken
from me 'cause I didn't know...

01:03.997 --> 01:04.931
how to fight.

01:04.998 --> 01:08.635
Are you interested in
exploring what we had?

01:08.701 --> 01:13.440
There's no chance in hell
he's getting her.

01:13.506 --> 01:14.774
I still feel something.

01:14.841 --> 01:16.876
Chris, you can feel it
for forever,

01:16.943 --> 01:19.012
but she's not
reciprocating that to you.

01:19.078 --> 01:20.747
You're kind of starting
to piss me off a bit.

01:20.814 --> 01:23.750
- You're pissing me off a bit.
- Oh, my god, this is so brutal.

01:23.817 --> 01:26.352
I'm really just ready to snap.

01:26.419 --> 01:27.987
This is the new Chris.

01:28.054 --> 01:31.858
This and other predictable
things on The Bachelor.

01:31.925 --> 01:34.561
Dah-dah-dah-dah
dah-dah-dah!

01:34.627 --> 01:35.962
Yo!

01:41.367 --> 01:42.469
- Hello!
- Hey!

01:42.535 --> 01:44.437
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, what's up, friends?

01:44.504 --> 01:47.006
As soon as Vay walks in
the room with Kamil,

01:47.073 --> 01:49.309
I find it really
uncomfortable vibes.

01:49.375 --> 01:50.643
But I do want to see how
this plays out ́cause

01:50.710 --> 01:52.045
I like a good cat fight.

01:52.111 --> 01:53.480
Meow.

01:53.546 --> 01:54.747
Was there a kiss?

01:57.951 --> 02:01.721
Um, yeah, we kissed, yeah.

02:01.788 --> 02:04.724
Vay and I don't have
a very, like,

02:04.791 --> 02:06.926
chummy relationship back home.

02:06.993 --> 02:11.064
Vay is a little bit more
abrasive and...

02:11.131 --> 02:12.132
aggressive.

02:12.198 --> 02:15.502
It's only a matter of time
before you get to see

02:15.568 --> 02:18.538
people's real personalities.

02:18.605 --> 02:21.741
What's an immediate deal breaker
for you in a relationship?

02:21.808 --> 02:24.777
Mine would be respect.

02:24.844 --> 02:28.915
If you don't offer respect to,
you know, those around you,

02:28.982 --> 02:30.917
never mind the person that
you're trying to pursue,

02:30.984 --> 02:32.752
then I don't want
any part of it.

02:32.819 --> 02:36.990
A big thing that I can't
tolerate are liars.

02:37.056 --> 02:39.492
I treat my best friends
with total respect.

02:39.559 --> 02:40.994
I would never lie to them,
I would never hurt them.

02:41.060 --> 02:42.462
Like, it just wouldn't
even cross my mind.

02:42.529 --> 02:44.697
So, I feel like the partner
I end up with,

02:44.764 --> 02:46.533
I have to have that
same connection.

02:48.635 --> 02:52.872
What's the hardest part
about dating you?

02:52.939 --> 02:56.910
Since we're by a fire, usually
the person that I meet,

02:56.976 --> 02:58.177
I throw ́em right in the fire.

02:58.244 --> 03:01.648
I bring them around my family,
and if they can't hang with

03:01.714 --> 03:05.652
my family and friends, they
can't probably be with me.

03:05.718 --> 03:07.487
My sense of independence.

03:07.554 --> 03:10.490
I think that can be
challenging for some

03:10.557 --> 03:12.125
men to wrap their
head around.

03:12.192 --> 03:14.093
Yeah, no, that's music to
my ears, so...

03:14.160 --> 03:16.596
Disagree.

03:20.466 --> 03:23.503
Okay, when was the last time
you ghosted someone?

03:23.570 --> 03:25.004
And why?

03:25.071 --> 03:26.973
I would love to hear people who
ghost people's perspective

03:27.040 --> 03:30.810
́cause I'm genuinely, like, why?
Been ghosted, never ghosted.

03:30.877 --> 03:32.845
Don't understand it.

03:32.912 --> 03:35.448
I've gone on dates and
wasn't feeling it.

03:35.515 --> 03:36.950
They didn't text me,
I didn't text them.

03:37.016 --> 03:38.251
I don't consider
that ghosting.

03:38.318 --> 03:40.553
So, it's like, you know what,
neither of us are feeling it.

03:40.620 --> 03:41.821
It's all good.

03:41.888 --> 03:44.023
You know, I've been on dates as
well, Chris, that you know,

03:44.090 --> 03:45.058
I wasn't feeling it.

03:45.124 --> 03:48.728
But I, at least, you know,
messaged the person.

03:48.795 --> 03:51.931
Everybody saying they haven't
ghosted is full of shit.

03:51.998 --> 03:54.167
I'm not gonna lie to you guys,
I just ghosted my sweater and

03:54.234 --> 03:56.102
I have zero regrets.

03:56.169 --> 03:57.136
Paradise, for me,

03:57.203 --> 03:59.205
I feel like has been
especially hard because...

03:59.272 --> 04:00.940
in the past, I'm one of
those girls that'll like,

04:01.007 --> 04:03.109
get ghosted, get led on.

04:03.176 --> 04:06.613
There is somebody that I'm
worried is going to show up and

04:06.679 --> 04:09.449
I really just don't want to see
them because he ghosted me.

04:09.515 --> 04:13.453
And, I think it scarred me.

04:13.519 --> 04:18.224
Based on first impressions, is
there someone here for you?

04:18.291 --> 04:21.461
I definitely think that
there's someone

04:21.527 --> 04:24.063
here for myself, personally.

04:24.130 --> 04:25.765
Yeah, obviously,
it's only the second day,

04:25.832 --> 04:27.734
but we've clearly made a
strong connection here.

04:27.800 --> 04:29.936
Buti it's, it's one day
at a time.

04:30.003 --> 04:33.706
I'm very eager and very excited
to get to know everybody else

04:33.773 --> 04:35.174
on a more profound level.

04:35.241 --> 04:39.112
I know what I feel and, like,
who I've connected with.

04:42.281 --> 04:44.651
Definitely had a great date
today and there was

04:44.717 --> 04:45.952
definitely a
connection there.

04:46.019 --> 04:48.888
I'm super excited
about it. Yeah.

04:48.955 --> 04:50.957
Today's day two.

04:51.024 --> 04:54.861
And, I really had a great time
and a great date as well.

04:54.927 --> 04:58.197
But, I want to follow
my heart and...

04:58.264 --> 05:01.000
right now, my heart is just...

05:01.067 --> 05:02.969
you know, pumping and...

05:05.104 --> 05:10.677
It hasn't solidified for
someone, yet, at this moment.

05:17.050 --> 05:20.887
♪ [Rock music
continues] ♪

06:33.025 --> 06:34.761
So, how are things with you?

06:34.827 --> 06:37.897
- Good, still looking.
- That's good.

06:37.964 --> 06:40.700
- Yeah, I don't know.
- Any connections?

06:40.767 --> 06:45.271
So, the bonfire just ended and,
I noticed that...

06:45.338 --> 06:49.375
Kamil went off with Cailin. So,
I just took this opportunity

06:49.442 --> 06:51.144
to get to know someone else.

06:51.210 --> 06:52.712
And then you gave me
my first hug and

06:52.779 --> 06:53.846
I'm never gonna forget it.

06:53.913 --> 06:54.781
We had a good hug.
When I hugged you,

06:54.847 --> 06:55.815
I was like,
no, you're getting a hug.

06:55.882 --> 06:57.950
It was the best hug I've
gotten in a long time.

06:58.017 --> 06:59.886
- Long time.
- Long time.

06:59.952 --> 07:01.187
I swear.

07:01.254 --> 07:05.925
Joey's not the typical man I
would go for in everyday life.

07:05.992 --> 07:07.960
And, that's intriguing to me.

07:08.027 --> 07:09.929
- How old are you?
- So, I just turned 31.

07:09.996 --> 07:11.898
Me, I'm 32 this year.
Late November.

07:11.964 --> 07:12.865
- November?
- 26th.

07:12.932 --> 07:17.303
- Okay, I'm April 27th.
- April 2-7... wow.

07:17.370 --> 07:20.706
That's weird. So, you saw the
tattoo on my chest earlier,

07:20.773 --> 07:21.908
this guy that I have
tattooed here?

07:21.974 --> 07:24.243
- Yeah?
- So, that was my buddy Brandon.

07:24.310 --> 07:26.779
- He passed away when I was 14.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

07:26.846 --> 07:28.147
That's the day he passed away.

07:31.250 --> 07:34.020
It happened a long time ago,
but it's still...

07:34.086 --> 07:38.758
fresh, in a way.

07:38.825 --> 07:42.728
Losing your closest friend
at that age is not easy.

07:42.795 --> 07:45.698
It still isn't easy.

07:45.765 --> 07:48.201
- I just got chills.
- Interesting.

07:48.267 --> 07:50.136
I don't know if that's a good
chills or bad chills.

07:50.203 --> 07:51.237
I think it's good chills.

07:51.304 --> 07:54.240
There's some happiness
on a sad day. I like that.

07:54.307 --> 07:55.908
- Wow.
- Yeah.

07:55.975 --> 07:57.143
Vay is so sweet.

07:57.210 --> 08:00.246
And right now, I'm just
clicking with her.

08:00.313 --> 08:02.348
It's the most real conversation
I've had since I've been here

08:02.415 --> 08:04.450
with somebody and
we're really...

08:04.517 --> 08:08.154
at least, I for sure think that
we're connecting on something

08:08.221 --> 08:11.324
deeper than just the top 20%
of a conversation.

08:11.390 --> 08:12.925
- Okay.
- Alright.

08:12.992 --> 08:15.161
- I really liked our chat.
-

08:15.228 --> 08:17.797
- Okay, we'll talk later.
- Yeah.

08:17.864 --> 08:22.101
As of right now, I might have
two connections on Paradise.

08:22.168 --> 08:24.103
God, I just gotta carry this
around with me all night now.

08:24.170 --> 08:25.705
That was a bad move, Joey.

08:37.149 --> 08:38.351
We need drinks, Kev.

08:38.417 --> 08:39.452
- Yeah?
- Stat.

08:39.519 --> 08:42.355
- Ladies, how are you doing?
- Hello, what an outfit!

08:42.421 --> 08:44.156
- Thanks, I know.
- You shock every time.

08:44.223 --> 08:45.291
Decided to wear clothes today.

08:45.358 --> 08:47.293
It's a bit of an awkward
change, but...

08:47.360 --> 08:50.730
You missed my hole in one
earlier. Come on!

08:50.796 --> 08:53.065
I'm feeling great.
Beautiful day in Paradise.

08:53.132 --> 08:54.834
What else can I say?
Ladies out.

08:54.901 --> 08:58.304
I see bikinis flaunting.
And, I want more.

09:02.041 --> 09:03.976
So, who wants to
spill the gossip?

09:04.043 --> 09:08.347
So, right now, we have
a love square.

09:08.414 --> 09:12.151
We have Caitlin that likes
Kamil, Kamil likes Vay,

09:12.218 --> 09:15.755
Vay likes Kamil, but Kamil also
likes Caitlin. And then,

09:15.821 --> 09:18.958
we're not entirely sure how
Caitlin feels about Chris.

09:19.025 --> 09:21.961
So, right now, there's just
a lot of unknowns.

09:22.028 --> 09:24.430
This is Paradise.

09:24.497 --> 09:26.332
This morning when I woke up,
like, I was like,

09:26.399 --> 09:28.134
you know what, like, I had a
really great connection

09:28.200 --> 09:31.137
with you yesterday.
Like, date was amazing.

09:31.203 --> 09:32.405
I got to know a lot
about you,

09:32.471 --> 09:33.272
and we have a lot
of similarities.

09:33.339 --> 09:36.943
- Yeah, we do.
- I really do adore you.

09:37.009 --> 09:39.211
And, I don't want to be that
guy jumping from girl to girl

09:39.278 --> 09:42.014
́cause it's not me.
Like, once I know, like,

09:42.081 --> 09:44.784
I have something special,
I want to hold onto it.

09:44.850 --> 09:47.019
With Vay yesterday,
I had an amazing day.

09:47.086 --> 09:49.488
I don't know how to like...

09:49.555 --> 09:51.090
how to put this in words.

09:51.157 --> 09:52.525
Put it in words.

09:52.591 --> 09:55.795
I want to explore my
relationship with Caitlin,

09:55.861 --> 09:58.197
at this moment.
And, I think I mentioned it

09:58.264 --> 10:01.801
yesterday that me
and Caitlin met before.

10:01.867 --> 10:04.503
And, like I feel a certain way
towards Caitlin.

10:04.570 --> 10:06.038
Like, what's up?
I'm Vay.

10:06.105 --> 10:07.840
Like, I'm just,
I'm chill, like...

10:09.175 --> 10:15.247
I'm just so confident in who I
am that it's very hard for me

10:15.314 --> 10:17.850
to sit there and be
someone's second choice.

10:17.917 --> 10:19.318
I already know I'm
not your person.

10:19.385 --> 10:21.087
If you were my person,

10:21.153 --> 10:23.489
a connection with Caitlin
wouldn't stop that.

10:23.556 --> 10:25.458
I don't want to, like,
you know,

10:25.524 --> 10:27.259
like abandon you or anything.

10:27.326 --> 10:29.295
Oh, my god,
don't worry about it.

10:29.362 --> 10:32.331
I can't, I can't sit here and
tell you I'm upset because

10:32.398 --> 10:34.033
I feel the same way
for someone else.

10:34.100 --> 10:36.435
- So, like, I can't really-
- No, I get it.

10:36.502 --> 10:39.538
So, I guess that kind of
like shifted my mindset

10:39.605 --> 10:43.042
into just focusing on Joey.

10:43.109 --> 10:44.610
Thank you for being
honest with me.

10:44.677 --> 10:46.212
Yeah, I just want to be
transparent.

10:46.278 --> 10:48.280
I love that.

10:48.347 --> 10:50.516
How was your night?

10:50.583 --> 10:52.618
- It was good!
- Yeah?

10:52.685 --> 10:58.457
Yesterday, saw a little kiss
between Brendan M. and Stacy.

10:58.524 --> 11:00.292
Caught me off guard
a little bit.

11:00.359 --> 11:03.262
But, like, I get it.

11:03.329 --> 11:05.464
There was a large
range of emotions

11:05.531 --> 11:09.068
for your girl yesterday.

11:09.135 --> 11:11.337
Paradise is all about
exploring, you know,

11:11.404 --> 11:12.972
relationships and seeing
what kinds of connections

11:13.039 --> 11:14.240
are out there for you.

11:14.306 --> 11:17.877
But, I know there's a fine line
that I'm teetering here.

11:17.943 --> 11:20.446
I mean, I just kissed two girls
in the same night.

11:20.513 --> 11:22.882
Yeah, I got a lot on my plate.

11:22.948 --> 11:25.251
I've definitely enjoyed,
you know,

11:25.317 --> 11:30.322
spending some time with you.
And, some other people as well.

11:30.389 --> 11:33.392
Angela and I, you know, we seem
to have some kind of connection.

11:33.459 --> 11:34.593
Correct.

11:34.660 --> 11:37.997
And, you know, I don't want
to make it seem as though

11:38.064 --> 11:40.633
I'm focused on
just one person.

11:40.700 --> 11:41.701
Mhm.

11:41.767 --> 11:42.735
I don't want you to feel as
though, you know,

11:42.802 --> 11:44.904
it takes away from whatever
kind of connection

11:44.970 --> 11:45.905
that we have.

11:45.971 --> 11:46.939
- Of course.
- You know?

11:47.006 --> 11:50.042
I'm getting slight mixed
signals from Brendan M.

11:50.109 --> 11:51.210
It's like, "Let's go.

11:51.277 --> 11:52.978
Let's explore other options,
let's see other people,

11:53.045 --> 11:55.081
let's see what connections
are out there.

11:55.147 --> 11:58.417
But also, let's go,
let's go make out".

11:58.484 --> 12:01.654
I know in my soul, like, I am,
I am enough for someone.

12:01.721 --> 12:04.523
I am... you know?

12:04.590 --> 12:06.025
You've gotta get a
little bit back.

12:06.092 --> 12:07.426
I'm not getting any.

12:07.493 --> 12:09.995
I feel like I need to go
explore other options

12:10.062 --> 12:11.263
with other people too.

12:18.237 --> 12:19.505
Oh, shit!

12:24.376 --> 12:26.312
What's up!

12:26.378 --> 12:27.947
What?

12:28.013 --> 12:30.149
- me, there's a new guy.
- What's up, bro?

12:30.216 --> 12:31.250
- David, how you doing?
- Nice to meet you.

12:31.317 --> 12:32.618
Hi, David.

12:32.685 --> 12:34.386
This feels like Deja Vu.

12:34.453 --> 12:35.554
This guy's name is David.

12:35.621 --> 12:38.657
He was on The Bachelorette,
and he is not a good guy.

12:38.724 --> 12:40.593
Yeah, somebody I hate. Ew.

12:40.659 --> 12:41.527
Noted.

12:41.594 --> 12:45.097
This guy did something
just so, so gross.

12:45.164 --> 12:46.532
- Hi, I'm Kit.
- Kit.

12:46.599 --> 12:48.267
- Nice to meet you.
- David, nice to meet you.

12:48.334 --> 12:49.602
He does not deserve to be here.

12:49.668 --> 12:52.738
He's the definition of here
for the wrong reasons.

12:52.805 --> 12:56.142
I'm gonna go say hi
to the last people.

12:56.208 --> 12:58.110
I'm not getting up.

12:58.177 --> 13:00.146
Lisa, how are ya?

13:00.212 --> 13:01.514
We don't hug,
that's not a thing.

13:01.580 --> 13:02.581
Alright, no hugs.

13:02.681 --> 13:06.285
This and other predictable
things on The Bachelor.

13:10.623 --> 13:12.525
What's up!

13:12.591 --> 13:13.726
What?

13:13.793 --> 13:14.527
- What's up, bro?
- David, how you doing?

13:14.593 --> 13:16.595
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi, David.

13:16.662 --> 13:19.698
This guy is like a used
greasy car salesman.

13:19.765 --> 13:22.101
He'll tell you exactly
what you want to hear.

13:22.168 --> 13:25.404
And, you won't find out
what a piece of crap

13:25.471 --> 13:30.009
you just paid for until
it's too late.

13:30.075 --> 13:33.212
- Oh, my god!
- What's up, brother?

13:33.279 --> 13:34.346
Hi, I'm David.

13:34.413 --> 13:37.049
I'm from Bachelorette Canada
season one with Jasmine.

13:37.116 --> 13:39.385
I had an amazing time
on that season.

13:39.451 --> 13:41.086
This is a very beautiful place.

13:41.153 --> 13:42.588
The woman of my dreams
could be on the beach.

13:42.655 --> 13:44.390
I'm excited to see
who's out there.

13:44.456 --> 13:45.724
I'm ready for love.

13:45.791 --> 13:47.326
Cringe life.

13:47.393 --> 13:49.428
I'm gonna go say hi to
the last people.

13:49.495 --> 13:51.063
It's so good to see you,
brother, man.

13:51.130 --> 13:52.064
Seriously, dude.

13:52.131 --> 13:55.701
- I'm not getting up.
- Lisa, how are ya?

13:55.768 --> 13:57.036
We don't hug,
that's not a thing.

13:57.102 --> 13:58.637
Alright, no hugs.

13:58.704 --> 14:01.173
Buddy... nay-nay.

14:01.240 --> 14:02.775
You want a beer?
You want a twisted tea?

14:02.841 --> 14:04.643
- Those are popular.
- I'll take a twisted tea.

14:04.710 --> 14:06.445
Yeah, let's do a twisted tea.

14:06.512 --> 14:09.782
By the way, we gotta get you in
more beach, beach apparel.

14:09.849 --> 14:12.284
I'm about to take my pants off.
-

14:12.351 --> 14:16.322
While everybody's here
in earshot, I got a card.

14:16.388 --> 14:18.390
I haven't read
what's inside of it.

14:18.457 --> 14:19.658
This is good.

14:19.725 --> 14:22.695
"Cupid has an arrow for you.
Pick your perfect match".

14:22.761 --> 14:25.297
I'm gonna have to probably get
to know some of you so,

14:25.364 --> 14:26.632
if anybody wants to
hang out or maybe-

14:26.699 --> 14:28.534
- I'll go chat with you.
- Sure, yeah.

14:28.601 --> 14:31.437
- Let's go chat.
- Get it, Alice! Woo!

14:31.503 --> 14:32.838
We'll be back.

14:32.905 --> 14:36.475
It's good
to have you here.

14:36.542 --> 14:37.843
I know. Wow,
you're gorgeous.

14:37.910 --> 14:39.612
Oh, thank you.

14:39.678 --> 14:41.747
Okay, so Lisa, I want to know.
For realsies.

14:41.814 --> 14:44.516
We went on a
bunch of dates in Toronto.

14:44.583 --> 14:46.318
Told me everything
I wanted to hear.

14:46.385 --> 14:49.822
You had, I think, a really
confident entrance.

14:49.889 --> 14:50.823
Really, thank you.

14:50.889 --> 14:52.625
Yeah, I think you came off
really confident.

14:52.691 --> 14:54.560
You looked like you knew
what you were doing.

14:54.627 --> 14:58.163
I had an influencer opportunity
to go to an adult summer camp.

14:58.230 --> 14:59.732
He's like, "Oh, my god,
I want to go with you so bad.

14:59.798 --> 15:02.167
Oh, my god".
Begged me to go.

15:02.234 --> 15:03.636
But maybe like,
he's into me and like

15:03.702 --> 15:04.837
he wants to
finally hang out.

15:04.903 --> 15:07.239
Like, this is a trip, right?

15:07.306 --> 15:08.841
I play a lot of soccer.
You could probably tell.

15:08.908 --> 15:11.243
I have a pretty nice butt when
I was walking by, so...

15:11.310 --> 15:12.411
We were watching.

15:12.478 --> 15:13.612
- Yeah.
-

15:13.679 --> 15:16.649
You are, honestly, lovely.
And I had a great time with you.

15:16.715 --> 15:18.484
Thank you.
Same to you.

15:18.550 --> 15:20.719
He ignores me the whole time.
He runs around

15:20.786 --> 15:22.688
telling everybody he's
there because he's famous.

15:22.755 --> 15:25.557
And then, literally, had sex
with another girl.

15:25.624 --> 15:28.193
- What? Wow!
- And, you know...

15:28.260 --> 15:30.262
Jesus, so what was your
last contact with him

15:30.329 --> 15:32.498
since that camp?
- Since that camp.

15:32.564 --> 15:35.534
I am the least likely to have
shit like this happen.

15:35.601 --> 15:38.170
Like, I do not deserve
this kind of...

15:40.306 --> 15:44.176
So, I've been probably
more on edge.

15:45.611 --> 15:49.381
Yeah. Cringey.

15:49.448 --> 15:50.849
- Hi!
- Hey!

15:50.916 --> 15:53.419
Everybody was kind of paired
off over there and I...

15:53.485 --> 15:55.354
I saw the girl squad,
so I figured I'd-

15:55.421 --> 15:57.189
- We're the girl squad.
- Mingle.

15:57.256 --> 15:58.590
Are we gossiping?
What's going on?

15:58.657 --> 16:02.261
David of three years ago, ah...

16:02.328 --> 16:05.364
definitely didn't really see
other people's perspectives.

16:05.431 --> 16:07.466
So, a little drama is,

16:07.533 --> 16:10.302
I actually used to see Lisa
for a little bit.

16:10.369 --> 16:11.937
Wow!

16:12.004 --> 16:14.273
The way things kind of
ended, it wasn't the best.

16:14.340 --> 16:16.408
And I feel really bad
about it. And I don't-

16:16.475 --> 16:17.776
What's your version
of the story?

16:17.843 --> 16:21.213
My version, like...
I feel like she wanted more,

16:21.280 --> 16:22.614
and I was never
gonna give her that.

16:22.681 --> 16:24.183
I would like to make it up
to her, but-

16:24.249 --> 16:25.417
So, why do you want
to apologize now?

16:25.484 --> 16:26.852
Why wouldn't you
apologize earlier?

16:26.919 --> 16:29.288
I tried.
She just never responded back.

16:29.355 --> 16:31.757
And I was like, if that's how
she wanted to deal with it,

16:31.824 --> 16:35.327
I'm totally okay with that.

16:35.394 --> 16:36.795
Ew, David.

16:36.862 --> 16:38.797
Lisa told me the story,
like, when it happened

16:38.864 --> 16:40.466
three years ago with David.

16:40.532 --> 16:42.935
And she was heartbroken,
and she was devastated.

16:43.001 --> 16:46.405
So, I have a hard time
believing him when he comes in

16:46.472 --> 16:48.540
and is like, "I tried to
apologize".

16:48.607 --> 16:51.810
Like, no you didn't.
No, you didn't.

16:51.877 --> 16:53.946
She threw some daggers at me,
and I was like, "Okay,

16:54.013 --> 16:55.114
I'm trying to dodge ́em".

16:55.180 --> 16:56.548
- She's got some big eyes.
- Trying to dodge ́em.

16:56.615 --> 16:57.750
Those big eyes!

16:57.816 --> 16:59.785
I took a few knives
out of my back.

16:59.852 --> 17:03.689
But you have a date card.
So, that's a little bit of a-

17:03.756 --> 17:05.791
Ha-ha-ha, appease me!

17:05.858 --> 17:08.327
That was great.
I felt it.

17:08.394 --> 17:11.296
So, yeah, David, he seems like
a really interesting guy.

17:11.363 --> 17:12.498
Definitely excited
that he's here.

17:12.564 --> 17:15.300
I was not expecting
that at all.

17:15.367 --> 17:18.404
I feel like there's hope
on the horizon.

17:18.470 --> 17:20.472
I'm gonna love getting
to know all of you.

17:20.539 --> 17:22.241
Having a date card's
really great.

17:22.307 --> 17:25.377
My first go around I was
known as "Dateless Dave".

17:25.444 --> 17:26.945
Not a title that I want to keep.

17:27.012 --> 17:29.681
So, it's really nice that I
finally get to experience

17:29.748 --> 17:32.017
a date in
The Bachelor realm.

17:35.354 --> 17:38.757
Do you think you're ready
for those next steps?

17:38.824 --> 17:39.758
What do you mean?

17:39.825 --> 17:43.429
Marriage, settling down,
starting your family?

17:43.495 --> 17:45.297
Yeah, you know. I mean,

17:45.364 --> 17:47.399
I don't want to
walk out of here with a...

17:47.466 --> 17:49.535
with a pregnant lady, per se,
you know what I mean?

17:49.601 --> 17:50.803
But like...

17:50.869 --> 17:53.405
Not to interrupt, super rude.

17:53.472 --> 17:56.875
But, would you like to go
on a date with me?

17:56.942 --> 17:58.710
Oh, my goodness!

17:58.777 --> 17:59.945
Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead.

18:00.012 --> 18:05.818
I feel so lucky to be picked by
David to go on the date today.

18:05.884 --> 18:07.152
I'm up for anything.

18:07.219 --> 18:11.290
Not sure what to expect, but I
think it's the first time that

18:11.356 --> 18:15.828
a guy I have pulled aside to
talk has actually reciprocated

18:15.894 --> 18:18.931
a little bit of that interest.
So, that stands out to me.

18:18.997 --> 18:20.432
- What's the next step?
- We're going on a date.

18:20.499 --> 18:21.967
I don't know what
the next step is.

18:24.670 --> 18:27.339
Okay, ladies, hold on, hold on.

18:27.406 --> 18:28.841
- Can we just cheers?
- Cheers!

18:28.907 --> 18:31.677
- To being queens.
- Queens!

18:33.946 --> 18:35.647
-
- You guys aren't boring.

18:37.716 --> 18:39.885
This needs to be the photo,
you guys!

18:42.955 --> 18:44.089
Oh!

18:44.156 --> 18:46.391
Where's, like,
where's your mind at?

18:46.458 --> 18:47.659
Where's my mind at?

18:47.726 --> 18:51.029
I mean, last night's date was
great, and today's a new day.

18:51.096 --> 18:55.667
And, I know every single time
I see, like, Caitlin...

18:55.734 --> 18:56.802
there's something there,
you know.

18:56.869 --> 18:58.537
Okay. Just go grab her.

18:58.604 --> 19:00.472
Like, we can both go over
there right now and...

19:00.539 --> 19:01.673
Let's do it.

19:01.740 --> 19:03.842
Unfinished business. Ah...

19:03.909 --> 19:05.744
I'd like to know more
about Caitlin.

19:05.811 --> 19:08.614
I've never had alone time.
Never...

19:08.680 --> 19:10.949
never really dove deeper.

19:11.016 --> 19:12.518
- You see how I am with Illeana.
- Yeah.

19:12.584 --> 19:14.753
Straight shooter.
Be a straight shooter.

19:14.820 --> 19:17.055
- Love ya.
- Thank you.

19:17.122 --> 19:18.557
- Hola.
- Look who it is.

19:18.624 --> 19:20.359
- What's up? How are you?
- Not a whole lot.

19:20.425 --> 19:21.460
Just hanging out over here.

19:21.527 --> 19:22.961
- Is there room for me anywhere?
- Yeah.

19:23.028 --> 19:26.398
It's incredibly important for
Kamil and I to continue to

19:26.465 --> 19:28.667
explore this connection.

19:28.734 --> 19:31.837
We still have so much more to
learn about each other and,

19:31.904 --> 19:33.005
I'm excited.

19:33.071 --> 19:33.972
Are you comfy?

19:34.039 --> 19:35.641
You're, like,
you're gonna literally-

19:35.707 --> 19:37.943
Should we give them
some privacy?

19:38.010 --> 19:39.611
Yeah, maybe you guys should-

19:39.678 --> 19:40.846
I'm gonna run off
to the distance.

19:40.913 --> 19:43.048
Yeah. Maybe you guys should go
to the bar and get a drink.

19:43.115 --> 19:44.850
- Bye.
- Let's go.

19:44.917 --> 19:46.685
Brendan S. is the
ultimate wing man.

19:46.752 --> 19:48.554
I love him.

19:48.620 --> 19:52.491
We've only like really been able
to like sit down and chat once.

19:52.558 --> 19:53.825
- Right.
- Right before you left.

19:53.892 --> 19:56.595
And then I got taken on a
date, which, you know,

19:56.662 --> 20:01.166
wasn't favourable for you.
- I was a little bit, like...

20:01.233 --> 20:03.168
I don't want to say, like,
jealous, but...

20:03.235 --> 20:06.405
Mhm, come here.

20:11.143 --> 20:13.745
Oh, they're kissing.

20:13.812 --> 20:15.614
Well, I guess
that confirms it.

20:15.681 --> 20:17.015
Yep.

20:21.720 --> 20:25.157
- Cute.
- You're the cute clementine.

20:25.223 --> 20:29.661
So, I was feeling uneasy,
like, about where your head

20:29.728 --> 20:32.464
would be at after your date.

20:32.531 --> 20:35.000
So, I had to kind of like,
you know,

20:35.067 --> 20:37.135
look out for myself
as well and...

20:37.202 --> 20:39.705
Chris is obviously
interested in me and...

20:39.771 --> 20:41.773
I didn't know how
to approach it all.

20:41.840 --> 20:43.909
'Cause you came back
looking so happy.

20:43.976 --> 20:46.979
I mean, it was a fun
date, you know.

20:47.045 --> 20:48.213
But if we had one,
it'd be amazing.

20:48.280 --> 20:50.482
- We'll have more fun dates.
- Yeah.

20:50.549 --> 20:52.484
Oh, God.
I'm getting the look.

20:52.551 --> 20:54.987
- From who?
- Who do you think?

20:55.053 --> 20:59.524
Chris just looks like his
whole life's just... deflated.

20:59.591 --> 21:03.762
I'm having a moment with Lisa
and we're just- as friends,

21:03.829 --> 21:05.197
and we're just,
we're just talking.

21:05.263 --> 21:08.900
And I'm also having my
heart sort of broken

21:08.967 --> 21:10.035
right in front of me.

21:10.102 --> 21:13.505
There are things I'm feeling
towards Caitlin and

21:13.572 --> 21:16.742
I'm seeing her form
connections with another guy.

21:16.808 --> 21:21.079
And, I'm also being a realist
in these moments and seeing,

21:21.146 --> 21:22.981
like, I'm looking at
body language.

21:27.119 --> 21:28.687
And I'm having this
moment with Lisa and

21:28.754 --> 21:30.589
I'm walking off the beach...

21:30.656 --> 21:34.993
And Stacy comes and says,
"I want to talk to you".

21:35.060 --> 21:36.561
He's all yours, girl.

21:36.628 --> 21:39.197
Something my mom always said...

21:39.264 --> 21:41.033
"You never know the when".

21:45.837 --> 21:48.607
Um...

21:48.674 --> 21:52.544
I hadn't talked to Chris
since day one.

21:52.611 --> 21:55.147
And then, he kind of just fell
off the face of the earth.

21:55.213 --> 21:57.649
I think he went to pursue
Caitlin and he, like,

21:57.716 --> 21:58.984
dove in deep.

21:59.051 --> 22:01.286
So, today I could tell there
was something wrong and

22:01.353 --> 22:03.789
I just like, as a friend,
like, wanted to just like,

22:03.855 --> 22:05.891
"Are you okay?" Like,
"Let's go chat".

22:05.957 --> 22:07.926
One of the reasons I was
excited about meeting you is

22:07.993 --> 22:10.595
because I've actually been
wanting to meet you

22:10.662 --> 22:13.598
for over 4 years.

22:13.665 --> 22:16.802
-
- I did, I'm serious.

22:16.868 --> 22:18.303
But what was it about me that,
like-

22:18.370 --> 22:20.105
- Your spirit.
- My spirit?

22:20.172 --> 22:22.574
There was a sweetness
about you that I just,

22:22.641 --> 22:24.309
and I just put it on
the back burner.

22:24.376 --> 22:26.712
I hope this isn't like
crazy to you?

22:26.778 --> 22:29.281
No! Listen, do you- have you
seen where we are?

22:29.347 --> 22:32.884
This is a conversation that
I've actually been

22:32.951 --> 22:35.721
wanting to have for...
for years.

22:35.787 --> 22:38.690
And I'm ready.
Stacy's it right now.

22:38.757 --> 22:41.793
- I saw you on The Bachelor.
- Okay.

22:41.860 --> 22:46.164
And, when I saw you I was like,
who's that girl?

22:46.231 --> 22:50.035
And, I don't know,
here we are.

22:50.102 --> 22:51.670
It's wild how the
universe works.

22:51.737 --> 22:53.271
- Are you okay with that?
- Of course!

22:53.338 --> 22:54.306
Like...

22:54.373 --> 22:57.275
Chris might not be my type,
but this Paradise,

22:57.342 --> 23:00.278
so I'm definitely taking
advantage of this time and

23:00.345 --> 23:02.748
just exploring my options.

23:02.814 --> 23:06.752
I've actually like, kind of
been into you for a while.

23:06.818 --> 23:08.653
That's awesome.

23:11.757 --> 23:14.826
- Yeah, let's just get cozy.
- That's what I'm saying.

23:14.893 --> 23:16.928
I'm glad that we really had
that chat yesterday and

23:16.995 --> 23:17.963
I'm glad that we-

23:18.029 --> 23:19.831
I'm glad we got to chat
because you also have

23:19.898 --> 23:23.034
just got here, like, jealousy.
I don't do that shit.

23:23.101 --> 23:26.104
I'm not a jealous man.
I'm confident in what I want.

23:26.171 --> 23:28.840
And if you feel like you want
to go talk to other people,

23:28.907 --> 23:30.942
get after it.

23:31.009 --> 23:33.311
At this point right now,
I don't.

23:35.447 --> 23:37.649
I'm happy where we are
right now.

23:37.716 --> 23:41.286
Me too. I was gonna wait so
much longer to do this,

23:41.353 --> 23:43.188
but I can't sit here and
not kiss you.

23:43.255 --> 23:44.656
- Can I, can I kiss you?
- Of course.

23:44.723 --> 23:46.024
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

23:51.363 --> 23:53.165
- Oh, shit!
- What?

23:53.231 --> 23:55.033
- Oh, shit!
- Did they just kiss?

23:55.100 --> 23:58.270
Vay and Joey just kissed.
Um, okay.

23:58.336 --> 23:59.171
Who did it first?

23:59.237 --> 24:01.306
I don't know,
I caught the tail end.

24:01.373 --> 24:04.042
- Well, you're a good kisser.
- So are you.

24:07.979 --> 24:09.314
Have you ever done
archery before?

24:09.381 --> 24:10.382
No, I haven't.

24:10.449 --> 24:13.051
Well, I haven't done it since
high school, so...

24:13.118 --> 24:14.386
we'll see how good I am.

24:14.452 --> 24:17.856
The date that I am going on
with Alice is archery.

24:17.923 --> 24:20.292
It looks like it's just gonna
be a simple easy thing for us

24:20.358 --> 24:22.227
to get into and just chat.

24:22.294 --> 24:23.762
I'm gonna- you know what,
I'm gonna close my eyes.

24:23.829 --> 24:24.830
I'm gonna do this.

24:24.896 --> 24:27.165
And, maybe hit my mark with her.

24:27.232 --> 24:30.235
That was really punny.
I'm sorry about that.

24:30.302 --> 24:31.903
- Oh!
-

24:31.970 --> 24:34.840
- Okay.
- Didn't work. My turn.

24:34.906 --> 24:37.108
Okay, so first,
keep the arm up.

24:37.175 --> 24:39.277
David is a bit of a cupid today.

24:39.344 --> 24:42.981
He's shooting the arrow,
trying to shoot it at my heart.

24:43.048 --> 24:45.684
- Let it rip.
- Oh!

24:45.750 --> 24:48.453
Whoa! You know what...

24:49.988 --> 24:52.724
Alright.

24:52.791 --> 24:54.292
- Boom!
- Oh! I heard that pop!

24:54.359 --> 24:56.795
- Woo!
-

24:56.862 --> 24:59.431
There you go!
Wha!

24:59.498 --> 25:02.834
Woo!

25:02.901 --> 25:04.803
Well, congratulations.

25:04.870 --> 25:07.806
Mwah!

25:07.873 --> 25:09.975
Went for a little kiss.
It landed.

25:10.041 --> 25:11.443
She seemed to like it.
It's going good.

25:11.509 --> 25:13.778
Sorry, I went in for the kiss.
I figured...

25:13.845 --> 25:15.847
it'd be like a nice moment.
- Oh.

25:15.914 --> 25:19.284
I usually wouldn't initiate a
first kiss on a first date,

25:19.351 --> 25:21.319
or a second date, or third date,
or fourth date.

25:21.386 --> 25:23.955
So, that was really unexpected.

25:27.559 --> 25:31.496
Obviously, I had my eyes
set on someone,

25:31.563 --> 25:35.066
and we had a moment.
And then, that seemed to shift.

25:37.235 --> 25:38.803
I know that you're a little bit
disappointed.

25:38.870 --> 25:43.241
You can be a hopeless romantic.
You can be excited and-

25:43.308 --> 25:45.977
but maybe you haven't given
someone else an opportunity

25:46.044 --> 25:49.881
to like show their
interest in you too.

25:49.948 --> 25:53.752
Yeah, I was exploring something
else and, you know what...

25:53.818 --> 25:57.989
Mm! You are as sweet
as a clementine.

25:58.056 --> 25:59.758
- it.
- She gone.

25:59.824 --> 26:02.260
It's her loss. Your gain.

26:02.327 --> 26:03.528
It's exactly that.

26:03.595 --> 26:05.764
And my gain, and my gain.
́Cause like, I don't want-

26:05.830 --> 26:08.133
- Their loss, their loss.
- It doesn't even matter.

26:08.199 --> 26:09.901
It doesn't even matter anymore.

26:09.968 --> 26:12.237
There's other people that
I'm still interested in,

26:12.304 --> 26:14.940
and other people that I haven't
even spoken to yet.

26:15.006 --> 26:16.041
So, I don't know what
our connection

26:16.107 --> 26:17.309
would be like, you know?

26:17.375 --> 26:19.010
Like, I know that I
want a husband.

26:19.077 --> 26:21.079
I know I want kids.
So, that's me.

26:25.250 --> 26:26.518
Yeah.

26:26.585 --> 26:28.286
Chris is a really lovey human.

26:28.353 --> 26:29.854
I think he's like a
breed of his own.

26:29.921 --> 26:34.025
He is very open.
He's very vulnerable.

26:34.092 --> 26:35.527
He wears his heart
on his sleeve.

26:35.594 --> 26:39.264
He's not going to fake his
emotions, which is refreshing.

26:39.331 --> 26:41.933
And, I'm just excited to see
where it goes and

26:42.000 --> 26:43.535
if we can build off this.

26:43.602 --> 26:45.236
I love music.

26:45.303 --> 26:47.372
I love, like, creating things.

26:47.439 --> 26:50.508
I love photography and
watching sunsets.

26:50.575 --> 26:53.979
And I love astrophysics and
microbiology and

26:54.045 --> 26:56.581
particle physics and like just-
I love it all.

26:56.648 --> 26:59.417
Everything's connected, like-
the more I learn about like

26:59.484 --> 27:01.553
thermoplastics, the more
I learn about like,

27:01.619 --> 27:03.822
legal documentation
programming, like,

27:03.888 --> 27:05.090
it's all connected.

27:05.156 --> 27:07.325
And it like helps me just do my
thing and understand the world,

27:07.392 --> 27:08.560
and the universe, and my place.

27:08.626 --> 27:10.228
Yeah.

27:10.295 --> 27:12.330
I'd like to get to
know you more.

27:12.397 --> 27:14.532
So... come here.

27:20.905 --> 27:23.942
Um, the Chris with kiss is...

27:24.009 --> 27:25.910
it's good.
It wasn't bad.

27:25.977 --> 27:28.113
It wasn't like...

27:28.179 --> 27:32.083
super passionate.
So, yeah.

27:34.019 --> 27:36.054
Come here. Stacy,
it's you and me right now.

27:36.121 --> 27:37.889
- Are you cool with this?
- Of course.

27:37.956 --> 27:39.858
- Alright, it's you and me.
- Killing it.

27:42.027 --> 27:43.161
<i>Coming up...</i>

27:43.228 --> 27:46.231
I wanted to celebrate your
arrivals at camp with a dance.

27:46.297 --> 27:49.000
Summer romance on the beach.

27:49.067 --> 27:52.003
You're with someone that
you're super crushing on.

27:53.371 --> 27:54.973
Obviously, we have a
little bit of a history.

27:55.040 --> 27:56.508
Dave, you've done me dirty.

27:56.574 --> 27:57.609
I don't trust David.

27:57.675 --> 27:58.610
How creative are we
gonna get here?

27:58.676 --> 28:00.345
Like, what is your angle?

28:00.412 --> 28:02.213
I was gonna give her
my rose tonight.

28:02.280 --> 28:03.348
It's too little too late.

28:03.415 --> 28:05.283
Oh, god, that sucks.

28:12.590 --> 28:14.859
- That was a lot of fun.
- That was.

28:14.926 --> 28:16.061
I'm not as strong as I look.
Oh, there we go!

28:16.127 --> 28:17.295
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

28:17.362 --> 28:20.465
Yeah, that was why I probably
shouldn't have done that.

28:20.532 --> 28:21.633
Thank you.

28:21.700 --> 28:25.136
So, like, what's your reason
for being in Paradise?

28:25.203 --> 28:28.573
I've dated around,
I've had relationships.

28:28.640 --> 28:32.277
And, I'm still on the
search for the one.

28:32.343 --> 28:35.280
I'm looking for something
that's long term.

28:35.346 --> 28:37.315
David is actively listening.

28:37.382 --> 28:41.219
He's asking good questions.
And it's good energy.

28:41.286 --> 28:44.022
Have you ever felt like
you were in love?

28:44.089 --> 28:45.223
- Yes.
- Yes?

28:45.290 --> 28:47.092
- Many times.
- What happened?

28:47.158 --> 28:52.597
I've gotten really close to
marrying other exes in the past.

28:52.664 --> 28:57.402
And, if I caught someone
lying, I don't take that.

28:57.469 --> 28:59.471
I don't tolerate any of that.

28:59.537 --> 29:01.973
So, I think at the
end of the day,

29:02.040 --> 29:05.376
I really want to look for
someone to just share life with.

29:05.443 --> 29:10.582
I think I'm just ready for love.
What about you?

29:12.650 --> 29:14.285
Yeah, you know, getting older.

29:14.352 --> 29:16.054
Those are the things
that you think about.

29:16.121 --> 29:18.289
Now, do I think somebody
can get engaged or

29:18.356 --> 29:20.658
get married in
three weeks? No.

29:20.725 --> 29:22.060
I don't think that's
gonna happen.

29:22.127 --> 29:24.596
But I'm excited to make
some connections and

29:24.662 --> 29:25.497
see where they go.

29:25.563 --> 29:27.432
Have you talked to
anybody else and...

29:27.499 --> 29:28.666
did you feel anything?

29:28.733 --> 29:31.069
Am I the only one
sparking any interest?

29:31.136 --> 29:33.438
- I'd say so.
- Yeah, what's up!

29:33.505 --> 29:37.041
Alice is really great, but
I still haven't met...

29:37.108 --> 29:39.043
pretty much everyone
here in Paradise.

29:39.110 --> 29:40.712
Coming here, I get to meet
everybody and

29:40.778 --> 29:42.080
feel everything out.

29:42.147 --> 29:43.581
You never know
what's gonna happen.

29:43.648 --> 29:46.017
David made it really clear
that he wants to meet

29:46.084 --> 29:49.053
everyone that's here.

29:49.120 --> 29:51.356
Well, maybe it's me,
maybe it's not,

29:51.422 --> 29:54.459
but I'm excited to
explore it with you.

29:54.526 --> 29:56.127
Paradise!

30:04.135 --> 30:07.105
Good evening, everybody.
How's everybody feeling tonight?

30:07.172 --> 30:08.973
Good!

30:09.040 --> 30:11.576
Good, good.
I wanted to celebrate

30:11.643 --> 30:16.514
your arrivals at camp with
an extra special event.

30:16.581 --> 30:20.418
The Camp Paradise
Sadie Hawkin's Dance.

30:20.485 --> 30:24.989
I don't even know what a Sadie
Hawk...kins, Hopkins?

30:25.056 --> 30:28.026
Hawkins dance is.

30:29.127 --> 30:31.663
What's the name of it?
Sarah Hoskins? Anyways...

30:31.729 --> 30:34.566
So, we've got the Sarah
Hoskins, Sarah Hopkins.

30:34.632 --> 30:38.036
Man, I'm sorry, Sarah!
I'm sorry, Sarah!

30:38.102 --> 30:39.437
So, Jesse comes to us,
he says he's gonna go to

30:39.504 --> 30:42.040
the Sarah Hoskins-
or is it Sarah Hopkins?

30:42.106 --> 30:43.474
You know,
I'm not entirely sure,

30:43.541 --> 30:45.643
but there's a dance going on.

30:45.710 --> 30:49.113
So, ladies, I am going to
ask you, one-by-one,

30:49.180 --> 30:52.483
to step forward.
And it'll be up to you to

30:52.550 --> 30:56.154
select your potential
date to the dance.

30:56.221 --> 30:58.523
And, seal it with a kiss.

30:58.590 --> 31:01.025
Ah!

31:01.092 --> 31:02.460
A lot more girls
than guys here,

31:02.527 --> 31:05.296
so it's kind of gonna be an
awkward situation.

31:05.363 --> 31:07.465
- Angela?
- Yeah?

31:07.532 --> 31:11.302
- We're gonna start with you.
- Okay.

31:11.369 --> 31:14.138
I would like to take Brendan M.

31:14.205 --> 31:15.406
Absolutely.

31:15.473 --> 31:18.376
Are we sealing this with a kiss?
- I guess so.

31:21.646 --> 31:23.248
Get some!

31:25.450 --> 31:28.152
I guess we're all
making out tonight?

31:28.219 --> 31:30.555
That's... that's tonight.

31:30.622 --> 31:33.124
We're a big make out party.

31:36.761 --> 31:38.763
Ana, you're up.

31:38.830 --> 31:39.764
Hm...

31:39.831 --> 31:41.799
Obviously, like there are
some of us who are

31:41.866 --> 31:44.602
not in a secure
relationship.

31:44.669 --> 31:47.605
So, I am definitely excited
to just have that

31:47.672 --> 31:48.740
one-on-one
time with David.

31:48.806 --> 31:50.475
- We just met!
- I know!

31:56.514 --> 31:58.516
Lisa, you are up.

31:58.583 --> 32:01.319
So, I'm feeling like
my only option is...

32:01.386 --> 32:03.321
maybe Jeremy because
we've talked so much.

32:03.388 --> 32:04.455
We have so much in common.

32:04.522 --> 32:07.558
So, I'm gonna go for it, but I
know my bunkmate, Kit,

32:07.625 --> 32:11.396
is also thinking she has a shot.

32:11.462 --> 32:14.098
Oh, yeah!

32:14.165 --> 32:15.800
Woo, Lisa!

32:15.867 --> 32:18.403
I was definitely shocked that
Lisa was my first kiss in

32:18.469 --> 32:20.371
Paradise and it was in
front of everybody.

32:20.438 --> 32:23.207
But, you know, you roll
with the punches.

32:23.274 --> 32:25.443
-
- Kit.

32:25.510 --> 32:28.112
Alright. Sorry, Lisa.

32:28.179 --> 32:30.148
Plot twist. Then Kit
comes to grab me,

32:30.214 --> 32:31.582
and now the both of
them are there.

32:34.352 --> 32:36.788
Okay, okay, no need
to one up.

32:36.854 --> 32:40.391
Don't worry, there's space
for two. Polyamory, guys.

32:40.458 --> 32:42.894
Illeana, you're up.

32:47.465 --> 32:49.133
Alice...

32:54.405 --> 32:56.474
Can I step out of the dance?

32:56.541 --> 32:59.177
Can you step out of the dance?

32:59.243 --> 33:01.446
Yeah, I can dance by myself.

33:01.512 --> 33:03.414
Aw, Alice!

33:03.481 --> 33:07.251
Kissing someone else to secure
a date for the evening,

33:07.318 --> 33:08.853
that's just not really me.

33:08.920 --> 33:11.522
I don't believe that a
kiss is appropriate yet

33:11.589 --> 33:14.392
until a romantic connection.

33:14.459 --> 33:15.593
Have fun, guys.

33:15.660 --> 33:17.829
Bye, Alice!

33:17.895 --> 33:20.598
So, Caitlin, you are up.

33:20.665 --> 33:23.935
Kamil, will you go to
the dance with me?

33:25.803 --> 33:27.205
What a shock!

33:31.409 --> 33:34.812
I mean, I wasn't gonna like
not kiss him, so...

33:35.947 --> 33:40.718
So, Jeremy, if you can remove
yourself from the,

33:40.785 --> 33:42.954
the triangle there and
come join me.

33:43.020 --> 33:45.590
Yeah, so Jeremy got two
options for the dance.

33:45.656 --> 33:48.693
Lisa, you know, who showed
some interest, as well as Kit.

33:48.760 --> 33:49.627
The guy's a busy man.

33:49.694 --> 33:51.863
He has a big decision
on his hands here.

33:51.929 --> 33:55.366
So, please, let us all know
who you choose to take

33:55.433 --> 33:57.802
to the Sadie Hawkins dance.

33:57.869 --> 34:01.272
I'm going to take
all the time I need.

34:01.339 --> 34:04.575
I think I'm going to take...

34:04.642 --> 34:06.244
I don't know where
Kit's head's at.

34:06.310 --> 34:07.278
I don't know where
Jeremy's head's at.

34:07.345 --> 34:09.680
And we're waiting to hear
who his choice is.

34:13.785 --> 34:14.852
Kit.

34:14.919 --> 34:18.856
- Yay.
- Yes, yes!

34:18.923 --> 34:20.758
I'm honestly surprised.

34:20.825 --> 34:23.327
I thought me and Jeremy might
have had something.

34:23.394 --> 34:26.464
He picked Kit so, I really
don't know where I stand

34:26.531 --> 34:28.499
at this point.

34:28.566 --> 34:33.337
That is definitely adding on to
the bad day that she's having.

34:33.404 --> 34:35.473
Hey, Lisa.
Vodka water?

34:35.540 --> 34:36.674
Yeah, ha.

It feels good.
It feels really good.

35:41.639 --> 35:43.641
Aw, that's so cute!

35:47.745 --> 35:49.714
Doo-doo-doo!

35:49.780 --> 35:52.750
Everywhere, and it's just the
most amazing moment.

35:52.817 --> 35:55.353
We're just all looking up
with our mouths open.

36:05.930 --> 36:07.098
This is a romantic moment.

36:07.164 --> 36:09.433
This is kind of the first one
I think we've really had.

36:09.500 --> 36:10.835
You know,
dancing under the stars,

36:10.902 --> 36:13.638
fireworks are
popping off. Ah!

36:23.047 --> 36:24.849
Summer romance.

36:24.916 --> 36:28.619
On the beach, listening to
"Canadian Summer".

36:28.686 --> 36:31.489
Fireworks going off,
exploding in the sky.

36:31.556 --> 36:33.624
You're with someone that
you really like and

36:33.691 --> 36:35.560
are super crushing on.

36:51.208 --> 36:54.111
Lisa, how are you?

36:54.178 --> 36:56.147
Obviously, things planned
out really great for me

36:56.213 --> 36:58.816
so far in Paradise.
You showing up.

36:58.883 --> 37:01.619
I'm wondering if you want to
just have a private chat?

37:01.686 --> 37:04.155
I don't trust David. How
creative are you gonna get here?

37:04.222 --> 37:06.023
Like, what is your angle?

37:06.090 --> 37:07.892
This is the first time I've
seen the guy since,

37:07.959 --> 37:10.127
so I'm just kind of a little
caught off guard.

37:10.194 --> 37:12.530
Obviously, we have a
little bit of a history.

37:12.597 --> 37:15.666
And, I just wanted to
come say I'm sorry.

37:15.733 --> 37:19.036
I feel really bad about it.
I was a piece of crap.

37:19.103 --> 37:20.638
- I just don't get it.
- I sucked.

37:20.705 --> 37:22.406
Dave, you done me dirty.

37:22.473 --> 37:24.775
Yeah, I agree. I suck.
You can hate me.

37:24.842 --> 37:26.110
If you want to say,
"David, I hate you,"

37:26.177 --> 37:27.778
you're allowed to do that.

37:27.845 --> 37:29.013
You hooked up with
another girl,

37:29.080 --> 37:31.782
waited three years to apologize
and you're doing it on TV

37:31.849 --> 37:33.684
because you want to save face.

37:33.751 --> 37:35.419
You never really gave me a
chance to apologize.

37:35.486 --> 37:37.021
You didn't reach out.

37:37.088 --> 37:40.725
What you do has consequences
for other people.

37:40.791 --> 37:41.993
We'll dig in to it later.

37:42.059 --> 37:44.795
That was the last time I ever
went on like a date or anything.

37:44.862 --> 37:47.765
I ruined everything?
I ruined your life.

37:47.832 --> 37:49.634
It makes me not trust anybody.

37:49.700 --> 37:51.902
Got it... yeah.

37:51.969 --> 37:54.672
- But, it's just like, man.
- Yeah, I made a mistake.

37:54.739 --> 37:55.840
I'm really sorry about it.

37:55.906 --> 37:57.174
I like to think in the
last three years,

37:57.241 --> 37:58.542
I've grown a little bit.
And even coming here-

37:58.609 --> 38:00.177
- I would hope so.
- Yeah.

38:00.244 --> 38:03.114
Hopefully, we can, you know,
bury it and move on.

38:03.180 --> 38:05.016
Because I, personally,
would love for you

38:05.082 --> 38:07.218
to have a great time here.
Well, what's your type?

38:07.284 --> 38:09.487
Like what are you looking for?
Like, in these guys?

38:09.553 --> 38:10.988
Someone like you,
but not a douche.

38:11.055 --> 38:12.523
Yeah.

38:12.590 --> 38:13.824
It's too little, too late.

38:17.061 --> 38:18.929
- Alrighty.
- Back to mingle town.

38:23.100 --> 38:24.001
<i>Coming up...</i>

38:24.068 --> 38:25.836
Yeah, it's very nice.
I have the power.

38:25.903 --> 38:27.805
Who do you think is going home?

38:27.872 --> 38:28.939
I'm pretty anxious.

38:29.006 --> 38:30.875
Everybody seems super
coupled up and

38:30.941 --> 38:32.476
there's a rose
ceremony tonight.

38:32.543 --> 38:33.778
I don't know what to do.

38:33.844 --> 38:36.681
I don't feel safe at all just
because I had a kiss with David.

38:36.747 --> 38:38.215
Like, that doesn't
mean anything.

38:38.282 --> 38:40.518
Yesterday was
challenging for me.

38:40.584 --> 38:43.921
So, I have made
the decision to...

38:46.757 --> 38:48.559
Anything can happen in Paradise.

38:58.302 --> 39:01.639
- Yeah, it's very nice out.
- It is nice out.

39:01.706 --> 39:03.040
That was a great night
last night.

39:03.107 --> 39:04.709
I didn't know you guys could
dance like that.

39:04.775 --> 39:05.843
You guys had the moves.

39:05.910 --> 39:07.278
I was looking at
all of you guys.

39:07.344 --> 39:09.046
I've never danced
to country before.

39:09.113 --> 39:10.948
- Yeah.
- It was hard.

39:11.015 --> 39:14.218
Country is not really my jam.
I'm more into reggaeton.

39:14.285 --> 39:16.620
But, you know what, I did it.

39:16.687 --> 39:19.924
- Who are you vibing with?
- Me? Vay.

39:19.990 --> 39:20.891
Vay, yeah, okay,
cheers to that, man.

39:20.958 --> 39:23.027
Hanging with that girl,
are you kidding me?

39:23.094 --> 39:25.796
It's easy like Sunday morning.
I like it.

39:25.863 --> 39:27.264
Is he the type of guy I
would normally go for

39:27.331 --> 39:30.034
in an everyday world?
No, he's not.

39:30.101 --> 39:32.269
But, I obviously went
on a date with Kamil,

39:32.336 --> 39:33.471
and Kamil is gorgeous.

39:33.537 --> 39:35.706
Like, we can all say he's
gorgeous, but like, that-

39:35.773 --> 39:37.208
I feel like the
conversation was forced.

39:37.274 --> 39:40.077
And like, I need a guy
that makes me laugh,

39:40.144 --> 39:42.179
and that's,
honestly, it's Joey.

39:42.246 --> 39:45.883
Kamil and I, we're vibing
pretty hard. So...

39:45.950 --> 39:50.321
I'm, yeah, very hopeful that the
rose will be coming from him.

39:50.387 --> 39:52.323
Everybody seems
super coupled up.

39:52.389 --> 39:54.592
And there's a rose
ceremony tonight.

39:54.658 --> 39:57.561
And now I'm panicking.
I don't know what to do.

39:57.628 --> 40:00.931
I feel like Brendan and I kind
of solidified something early.

40:00.998 --> 40:01.866
For me, it's just like,
you know what,

40:01.932 --> 40:03.901
you're the person I want
to be with and...

40:03.968 --> 40:05.302
no one else will
really change that.

40:05.369 --> 40:06.403
And like, you know,
if it's not really with you,

40:06.470 --> 40:09.807
I can't see myself like moving
forward in this too.

40:09.874 --> 40:11.108
Brendan S. and I were

40:11.175 --> 40:13.644
the first two people
to arrive to Paradise.

40:13.711 --> 40:16.814
And we just kind of connected,
like right off the bat.

40:16.881 --> 40:20.017
So, I'm hoping to get
his rose tonight.

40:20.084 --> 40:21.886
I shared a kiss
with Kit. Lisa...

40:21.952 --> 40:25.589
- You shared two kisses.
- Yeah, you know, it was...

40:25.656 --> 40:26.957
You know, something
cooking over there.

40:27.024 --> 40:27.958
Something sparking.

40:28.025 --> 40:29.593
That's it, you know what I mean?

40:29.660 --> 40:31.896
How was that kiss
last night though?

40:31.962 --> 40:34.165
I did, I did have a
kiss last night.

40:34.231 --> 40:36.700
David's a good kisser.
He's not bad.

40:36.767 --> 40:39.203
But yeah, like I mean-

40:39.270 --> 40:42.072
Going into tonight, I would
love to take some extra time to

40:42.139 --> 40:45.342
actually pull him aside and
really get to know him.

40:45.409 --> 40:48.145
Who do you think is going home?

40:48.212 --> 40:51.916
- Ah, I think Alice.
- Alice?

40:51.982 --> 40:55.119
- I haven't seen her all day.
- Lisa as well.

40:55.186 --> 40:56.954
Didn't you and David have a
conversation last night?

40:57.021 --> 40:58.389
Yeah, but that doesn't
mean anything.

40:58.456 --> 41:01.091
That was an apology
conversation that I deserved

41:01.158 --> 41:02.760
so, don't really know
what's gonna happen.

41:02.827 --> 41:04.361
But yeah, I'm pretty anxious.

41:04.428 --> 41:06.197
I feel, even if you
feel secure,

41:06.263 --> 41:07.364
like you have that connection
with someone,

41:07.431 --> 41:09.733
everything changes so fast
in here so it's impossible

41:09.800 --> 41:11.402
to feel 100% sure.

41:11.469 --> 41:14.872
I don't feel safe at all just
because I had a kiss with David.

41:14.939 --> 41:17.808
Like that doesn't mean anything.
So, I don't-

41:17.875 --> 41:19.310
I can't sit here
and be like, yeah,

41:19.376 --> 41:21.645
I'm super confident that I'm
gonna get a rose from him.

41:21.712 --> 41:24.882
Chris and I hadn't talked this
entire time so, yesterday,

41:24.949 --> 41:27.384
we got a little bit of time to
kind of connect and just...

41:27.451 --> 41:28.986
figure out who we are as people.

41:29.053 --> 41:32.223
I'm excited to see where it
could, where it could go.

41:32.289 --> 41:34.358
Are you hoping to get
his rose tonight?

41:34.425 --> 41:35.526
I am.

41:35.593 --> 41:37.828
Are you confident that you'll
get his rose tonight?

41:37.895 --> 41:40.397
Yeah, I mean.
Again, anything could happen.

41:40.464 --> 41:42.666
I have the power and
I'm still nervous.

41:42.733 --> 41:44.869
I don't have a chance of going
home and I'll still nervous.

41:44.935 --> 41:46.871
I have so many emotions
flowing, you know.

41:46.937 --> 41:47.872
But you need to be
a little scared.

41:47.938 --> 41:50.875
Like I- express yourself
and be vulnerable.

41:50.941 --> 41:52.376
If you're scared a little bit,
that's a good sign.

41:52.443 --> 41:54.178
You're not scared,
then you don't like her.

41:54.245 --> 41:56.013
That's it, you know.
But that's what love is.

41:56.080 --> 41:58.115
It's putting yourself at a
vulnerable position.

41:58.182 --> 42:01.452
Anything can happen
in Paradise.

42:01.518 --> 42:04.088
- Hey, girl!
- Hey, wow!

42:04.154 --> 42:07.892
- Hi! I'll join you guys here.
- CEO girl boss.

42:07.958 --> 42:10.895
That's a power suit!
I love it!

42:10.961 --> 42:12.696
Alice, I need you to
give me like an, aw!

42:14.932 --> 42:16.100
What's up?
How are you feeling?

42:16.166 --> 42:20.938
I just wanted to take the time
and opportunity to just address

42:21.005 --> 42:25.776
yesterday, and just kind of
clarify what happened.

42:25.843 --> 42:29.046
I think that yesterday was
challenging for me.

42:29.113 --> 42:33.317
I realize it's something that's
outside of my comfort zone.

42:33.384 --> 42:37.821
So, I have made the
decision to respectfully

42:37.888 --> 42:39.890
leave and go home today.

42:39.957 --> 42:41.158
Oh, we're gonna miss you.

42:41.225 --> 42:42.293
We're all gonna
miss you so much.

42:42.359 --> 42:44.061
Nobody wants you to leave.

42:44.128 --> 42:46.430
Everyone really needs to
know what works for them

42:46.497 --> 42:50.134
to secure a date for the
evening. That's alright.

42:50.200 --> 42:53.003
I really hope everyone else
had a great time.

42:53.070 --> 42:54.872
That's just not really me.

42:54.939 --> 42:56.807
- Bye!
- Bye, Alice.

43:03.981 --> 43:06.850
I think I'm someone who is
really looking for someone's

43:06.917 --> 43:10.120
personality, and that
emotional connection

43:10.187 --> 43:12.890
before any physical steps.

43:12.957 --> 43:15.526
I think the hard thing,
but right thing to do,

43:15.592 --> 43:19.196
is to stay true to myself and...

43:19.263 --> 43:22.099
keep on my own journey of
searching for love.

43:29.306 --> 43:30.374
<i>Coming up...</i>

43:30.441 --> 43:33.143
You're all about to face your
first rose ceremony.

43:33.210 --> 43:34.378
I'm a big question mark.

43:34.445 --> 43:36.113
Our romance, deadzos.

43:36.180 --> 43:37.481
Ana's a question mark.

43:37.548 --> 43:39.917
Goodbye, goodbye,
goodbye, goodbye.

43:39.984 --> 43:41.385
Alice will not be here tonight.

43:41.452 --> 43:43.320
I was gonna give her
my rose tonight, so...

43:43.387 --> 43:45.856
I don't know who David is
gonna give his rose to.

43:45.923 --> 43:48.926
- I'm the one who holds power.
- It's either me or Lisa.

43:48.993 --> 43:50.494
Caitlin, would you mind if
I steal you away?

43:50.561 --> 43:53.163
I need to understand the
connections that

43:53.230 --> 43:54.398
I've had with other people.

43:54.465 --> 43:58.369
Are you interested in
exploring what we had?

43:58.435 --> 44:00.070
What the...?

44:00.137 --> 44:01.538
Eye to eye,
let's talk like men.

44:15.619 --> 44:19.156
- You look beautiful.
- Thank you.

44:19.223 --> 44:22.926
It's gonna be a good night.
I don't know.

44:22.993 --> 44:27.031
Um, guys, I just wanted to tell
you guys that Alice left today.

44:27.097 --> 44:29.433
She sat down with the girls
and said that she thinks

44:29.500 --> 44:31.135
this isn't the
place for her.

44:31.201 --> 44:33.871
She knows what
she wants and,

44:33.937 --> 44:36.206
she just isn't sure she's
gonna find it here.

44:36.273 --> 44:39.843
But, she feels it's
what's best so...

44:39.910 --> 44:42.413
Alice will not be here tonight.

44:42.479 --> 44:46.884
- Damn.
- Oh, God. That sucks.

44:46.950 --> 44:50.587
She was maybe one of the
nicest people I ever met.

44:50.654 --> 44:54.391
Oh, my...

44:56.627 --> 44:59.596
Man, I was gonna give her
my rose tonight, so...

44:59.663 --> 45:03.534
I'm not really sure
what's gonna happen.

45:03.600 --> 45:05.102
Such an act.

45:05.169 --> 45:06.370
People tell you what
you want to hear.

45:06.437 --> 45:09.273
You believe them.
You don't know any better.

45:11.942 --> 45:15.112
Honestly, it takes, it takes a
very strong woman to do that.

45:15.179 --> 45:15.846
Good evening.

45:15.913 --> 45:17.114
I have so much
respect for her.

45:17.181 --> 45:18.549
- Jesse.
- Hey, Jesse.

45:18.615 --> 45:21.485
- How are y'all doing tonight?
- We're doing good.

45:21.552 --> 45:24.021
The past few days, how have
they been for you?

45:24.088 --> 45:26.290
- Interesting.
- Interesting.

45:26.356 --> 45:27.524
- But fun.
- To say the least.

45:27.591 --> 45:29.626
Brendan S., how about you?

45:29.693 --> 45:31.462
I'm very happy, very confident.

45:31.528 --> 45:34.031
Going into tonight and
the rest of the week.

45:34.098 --> 45:35.432
- Very happy.
- Good.

45:35.499 --> 45:38.168
And, Ana, how about you?
How has it been going so far?

45:38.235 --> 45:39.970
You know, things have been...

45:40.037 --> 45:41.939
they could be better.
They could be better, so...

45:42.005 --> 45:43.107
I don't, I don't really know
where I'm gonna get

45:43.173 --> 45:45.342
my rose from tonight, but...

45:45.409 --> 45:47.244
we'll see.
The night is young.

45:47.311 --> 45:49.379
Well, tonight's a really
important night.

45:49.446 --> 45:53.650
You're all about to face your
first rose ceremony.

45:53.717 --> 45:57.354
That means that one of
our ladies, unfortunately,

45:57.421 --> 45:59.623
will be heading home tonight.

45:59.690 --> 46:02.126
Now, before we
get to the roses,

46:02.192 --> 46:04.294
you'll all have one
last opportunity

46:04.361 --> 46:06.530
to solidify your
connections.

46:06.597 --> 46:10.067
And, secure your place
here in Paradise.

46:10.134 --> 46:12.669
- So, use your time wisely.
- Thanks, Jesse.

46:12.736 --> 46:16.507
- Enjoy the cocktail party.
- Let's get into it!

46:16.573 --> 46:19.042
- Ladies first.
- Tequila water with lemon.

46:19.109 --> 46:20.377
- Yeah?
- Thank you.

46:20.444 --> 46:21.411
Vodka.

46:21.478 --> 46:25.015
- Actually?
- Yeah.

46:25.082 --> 46:29.186
- Vodka.
-

46:29.253 --> 46:32.089
So, my job, like my full-time
job is being an actor,

46:32.156 --> 46:34.558
which is so weird on this
show because everybody goes,

46:34.625 --> 46:36.226
"Oh, so you're an
actor on the show"?

46:36.293 --> 46:37.461
And I'm like, "No,
I'm a human being".

46:37.528 --> 46:40.564
David's an actor, but I feel
like even if he's not doing it

46:40.631 --> 46:43.167
consciously, it would be
impossible not to,

46:43.233 --> 46:45.435
with cameras around,
when that's your job...

46:45.502 --> 46:49.239
to kind of take on a character
and be acting in a way,

46:49.306 --> 46:51.708
even when you're meant to be
being 100% yourself.

46:51.775 --> 46:54.511
You were gonna give your rose
to Alice and now she's gone.

46:54.578 --> 46:56.580
Where are you feeling?

46:56.647 --> 47:00.284
I've probably cried by myself
like 5 times.

47:00.350 --> 47:03.720
Like, it's killing me inside.
It's so bad.

47:03.787 --> 47:06.490
His crocodile tears,
like, I think, like-

47:06.557 --> 47:08.225
I don't know that
I trust that.

47:08.292 --> 47:11.328
I know what's gonna happen
is, it's gonna come down and

47:11.395 --> 47:12.729
I'm probably gonna
have the last rose.

47:12.796 --> 47:14.998
And I'm gonna have
a decision to make.

47:15.065 --> 47:17.067
And, having to put
somebody through

47:17.134 --> 47:19.036
what I had to go
through, it sucks.

47:19.102 --> 47:21.271
It feels so bad.

47:23.073 --> 47:25.442
Really, David,
like hot mess exudes.

47:27.744 --> 47:30.080
I've been kind of...

47:30.147 --> 47:32.449
undecided on how I
feel about David.

47:32.516 --> 47:34.351
That was such a
calculated speech.

47:34.418 --> 47:36.119
- From who?
- From David.

47:36.186 --> 47:38.355
It was just laughable when
he was speaking about

47:38.422 --> 47:41.258
how upset he was
about Alice leaving.

47:41.325 --> 47:42.426
Like, he's an actor.

47:42.492 --> 47:43.527
Everyone was sitting
there thinking,

47:43.594 --> 47:45.596
what are you even saying?

47:45.662 --> 47:48.098
I think he was honest in
what he was saying.

47:48.165 --> 47:49.333
I actually don't know.

47:49.399 --> 47:51.702
Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun.

47:51.768 --> 47:53.570
I am trying to figure
David out, and I am

47:53.637 --> 47:56.506
putting the data in the
Chris computer.

47:56.573 --> 47:58.242
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo.

47:58.308 --> 48:01.445
He told me he was, he wanted to
give Alice his rose tonight.

48:01.511 --> 48:03.380
Okay, so he's actually
confused now because

48:03.447 --> 48:04.314
that's what he was doing?

48:04.381 --> 48:05.716
That's cool, bro.
You went on one date

48:05.782 --> 48:08.352
and you're gonna pull
tears right here?

48:08.418 --> 48:11.255
I really like Alice. And...

48:13.824 --> 48:15.425
I was gonna give her
my rose tonight.

48:15.492 --> 48:18.128
I think she's special.

48:18.195 --> 48:22.065
Get the out of here!
Are you kidding me, bro?

48:22.132 --> 48:23.467
Am I third wheeling you guys?

48:23.533 --> 48:24.768
Hey, nothing wrong
with a third wheel.

48:24.835 --> 48:25.869
You ever seen a tricycle? That's
how they get down the road.

48:25.936 --> 48:29.072
- Such a wise man, you are.
- Ah, here and there.

48:29.139 --> 48:31.208
- That's good.
- How you feeling?

48:31.275 --> 48:33.076
I was gonna give
my rose to Alice.

48:33.143 --> 48:34.678
That's not an option anymore.

48:34.745 --> 48:35.579
Bro, I gotta be
honest with you.

48:35.646 --> 48:37.781
That felt a little
disingenuine there.

48:37.848 --> 48:39.483
I was talking to you earlier.

48:39.549 --> 48:41.618
I didn't feel any of that
kind of stuff from you

48:41.685 --> 48:43.053
when you were
talking about it.

48:43.120 --> 48:44.755
And as you leaned forward...

48:44.821 --> 48:46.790
touch of the water works coming.

48:46.857 --> 48:48.158
From my perspective, man,

48:48.225 --> 48:52.329
it kind of felt a little
bit not real.

48:52.396 --> 48:53.797
I get how you can see that.

48:53.864 --> 48:56.300
My voice box was
like cutting out.

48:56.366 --> 49:00.170
"Hm... ah".

49:00.237 --> 49:01.505
It just kind of bubbled over.

49:01.571 --> 49:03.407
I was like trying to say
something and it cut out.

49:03.473 --> 49:05.642
I'm like, what is- like, stop,
I want to say something.

49:05.709 --> 49:07.277
It just kept happening.

49:07.344 --> 49:11.214
Wow. I ain't
buying it.

49:11.281 --> 49:13.550
I, honestly, really, really
liked Alice.

49:13.617 --> 49:15.218
- Did ya?
- She's great.

49:18.488 --> 49:19.356
<i>Coming up...</i>

49:19.423 --> 49:20.724
Do you see some potential here?

49:20.791 --> 49:22.759
I think so.
Do you think so?

49:22.826 --> 49:25.429
I need to understand the
connections that

49:25.495 --> 49:26.630
I've had with other people.

49:26.697 --> 49:28.865
You're not a runner up, baby.
You're a main course.

49:28.932 --> 49:32.269
I felt an unexpected, very
strong connection with you.

49:32.336 --> 49:34.538
Do you feel anything?

49:34.604 --> 49:38.241
There's no chance in
hell he's getting her.

49:38.308 --> 49:40.210
Was there something
real there or-

49:40.277 --> 49:44.281
I never want to be sitting
between two guys.

49:44.348 --> 49:46.249
Oh, my god, this is so brutal.

49:51.888 --> 49:53.357
Like, it's just really awkward.
I mean, like,

49:53.423 --> 49:55.225
we made out and- were we
gonna make out?

49:55.292 --> 49:56.793
Probably not, but like-
You know?

49:56.860 --> 49:58.562
Yeah, absolutely, absolutely.

49:58.628 --> 50:00.831
So, the rose ceremony's coming
up and there's a few girls,

50:00.897 --> 50:01.898
we're definitely scrambling.

50:01.965 --> 50:04.735
We're all in our heads.
I'm a big question mark.

50:04.801 --> 50:06.136
I'm scared.

50:06.203 --> 50:07.504
Ana's a question mark.

50:07.571 --> 50:09.773
Goodbye, goodbye,
goodbye, goodbye.

50:09.840 --> 50:10.774
As for everybody else,

50:10.841 --> 50:12.576
they seem like they're
already in couples.

50:12.642 --> 50:14.244
I just feel really
comfortable with you.

50:14.311 --> 50:16.646
Like it feels... effortless.

50:16.713 --> 50:17.814
That's the word.

50:17.881 --> 50:20.717
Me and Brendan have been
talking for about three days.

50:20.784 --> 50:23.653
I don't think it's wrong to

50:23.720 --> 50:26.156
stick to something
that you like.

50:26.223 --> 50:28.558
I think we look really
good together.

50:28.625 --> 50:29.860
I'm staying in my lane.

50:29.926 --> 50:33.497
I'm not trying to get caught up
in, you know, two, three people.

50:33.563 --> 50:37.167
He wants more dates
with new people.

50:37.234 --> 50:38.535
We haven't gone on a date yet.

50:38.602 --> 50:42.506
I know. We just had
our hot tub moment.

50:42.572 --> 50:45.809
- But that was like a mini date.
- Yeah, it was good.

50:45.876 --> 50:48.412
The cocktail party is
crucial in Paradise.

50:48.478 --> 50:50.847
I've gone in super
confident and then,

50:50.914 --> 50:54.351
anyone can swoop in. If they
think that there's potential

50:54.418 --> 50:57.421
for a deeper connection,
you might not get a rose.

50:57.487 --> 51:00.590
I think most people here
are just nervous.

51:00.657 --> 51:02.659
Yeah, I'm nervous too
even though, like,

51:02.726 --> 51:05.629
I have power of the rose, right.
I'm still nervous.

51:05.695 --> 51:08.365
This is a time where you
need to let your

51:08.432 --> 51:10.801
man know how you're feeling.

51:10.867 --> 51:12.502
- I don't have to worry, right?
- No!

51:12.569 --> 51:14.938
- Okay.
- No, definitely not.

51:15.005 --> 51:16.907
You're not just gonna
take off tonight?

51:16.973 --> 51:20.610
Um, no. The canoe back to
New York is a long trip.

51:20.677 --> 51:21.678
- Okay.
- Yeah.

51:21.745 --> 51:22.913
Good.

51:22.979 --> 51:24.648
Let's go for a talk, Jer.

51:24.714 --> 51:26.249
I don't feel secure with
anyone at this point.

51:26.316 --> 51:29.186
Maybe Jeremy because it's
the only person that

51:29.252 --> 51:33.256
maybe isn't spoken for.
Fingers crossed.

51:33.323 --> 51:34.624
You're a very beautiful girl.

51:34.691 --> 51:36.726
And, we've had a couple of
conversations.

51:36.793 --> 51:38.462
You're nice to talk to and
you're easy going.

51:38.528 --> 51:41.531
I see Kit a little bit more
romantically.

51:41.598 --> 51:44.468
Yeah...
I do have to ask though, like,

51:44.534 --> 51:47.304
do I give off too much of
a bro girl vibe?

51:47.370 --> 51:49.206
'Cause I just feel like
everybody's friend zoning me.

51:49.272 --> 51:50.807
Honestly, you can't let that
get to your head.

51:50.874 --> 51:54.277
You're gonna find love.
You know, look at you, girl!

51:54.344 --> 51:56.213
Look at you!

51:56.279 --> 51:57.614
Look at you,
you're gonna find love.

51:57.681 --> 51:59.616
But don't close your heart,
you know what I mean?

51:59.683 --> 52:01.451
It was like, I feel like
my last shot of

52:01.518 --> 52:02.886
somebody who wasn't...

52:02.953 --> 52:06.790
locked down.
And now I'm like, what do I do?

52:06.857 --> 52:10.760
You seem like you're having a
hard time because Alice left.

52:10.827 --> 52:13.463
I had a really lovely connection
with her and losing her,

52:13.530 --> 52:16.900
I feel like- it is sad
because I have this rose.

52:16.967 --> 52:19.803
And, I was planning on
giving it to her.

52:19.870 --> 52:22.472
I have to decide who
to give a rose to,

52:22.539 --> 52:26.276
and my options right now
are Ana and Lisa.

52:26.343 --> 52:30.247
Lisa, we have our history
and all the bad things

52:30.313 --> 52:32.449
that have come with it.

52:32.516 --> 52:35.752
And it's a decision that's...

52:35.819 --> 52:37.621
very difficult.

52:37.687 --> 52:39.623
Like, our romance, deadzos.

52:39.689 --> 52:42.292
But friendzos,
I'm cool with. So...

52:42.359 --> 52:43.159
Friendzos?

52:43.260 --> 52:43.894
So, I can be honest
with you ́cause

52:43.960 --> 52:44.828
I don't care
if you like me.

52:44.895 --> 52:46.963
Is that supposed to
make me feel better?

52:47.030 --> 52:49.766
I don't know. I'm feeling a
little bit like an idiot.

52:49.833 --> 52:51.001
I don't trust David.

52:51.067 --> 52:53.837
Like, maybe I should have just
taken myself out like Alice.

52:53.904 --> 52:57.007
I just don't think there's
anything else I can do.

52:57.073 --> 52:59.943
Pfft.

53:00.010 --> 53:01.478
- Hey, Ana.
- Hello.

53:01.545 --> 53:03.013
- How are you?
- Good, how are you?

53:03.079 --> 53:04.714
Oh, thank you for the kiss.

53:04.781 --> 53:05.882
- You look lovely.
- You look lovely.

53:05.949 --> 53:07.951
That was a way more tame kiss
than what we're used to.

53:08.018 --> 53:09.486
I know, I was like...

53:09.553 --> 53:11.588
oh, okay.
How's it going?

53:11.655 --> 53:13.290
It's a lot, it's been
a tough night.

53:13.356 --> 53:15.358
You know what, I've been
wanting to come talk to you.

53:15.425 --> 53:18.929
I had this moment with David,
and I'm giving you my all.

53:18.995 --> 53:21.598
Even though Lisa is
totally cool with it,

53:21.665 --> 53:23.600
it's gonna hurt to see
Lisa go home.

53:23.667 --> 53:26.069
I'm very empathetic to that.
Lisa's my friend.

53:26.136 --> 53:27.103
I think you're great.

53:27.170 --> 53:29.706
I had a really great time
with you last night.

53:29.773 --> 53:31.675
Like, you're awesome.
And we match, so...

53:31.741 --> 53:33.343
- We do match!
- It's just, look at us.

53:33.410 --> 53:35.946
- How did we get it right?
- Look at us going.

53:36.012 --> 53:38.582
But no, I would never come here
and say, "Oh, my gosh,

53:38.648 --> 53:39.583
you have to choose me".

53:39.649 --> 53:41.885
Because like, you probably
don't know either.

53:41.952 --> 53:43.887
You're probably just as
conflicted and confused.

53:43.954 --> 53:46.957
- Yeah.
- I wish we had more time.

53:47.023 --> 53:48.224
I actually really like Ana.

53:48.291 --> 53:51.561
She was nice enough to choose
me in the Sadie Hawkins dance.

53:51.628 --> 53:53.096
She's a very good kisser.

53:53.163 --> 53:55.532
There's a lot of good
on this side.

53:55.599 --> 53:56.499
Arriba.

53:56.566 --> 53:58.034
Arriba.

53:58.101 --> 53:59.603
Abajo.

53:59.669 --> 54:00.804
Al centro.

54:00.870 --> 54:02.706
Pa'dentro.
Muy Bueno.

54:08.678 --> 54:09.946
Ai-yai-yai.

54:12.816 --> 54:15.085
Last night was nice, just...

54:15.151 --> 54:17.520
just to be like,
I was not in my head.

54:17.587 --> 54:20.523
I was just, it was just nice to
hold you and you got me.

54:20.590 --> 54:21.958
- Of course.
- So...

54:22.025 --> 54:25.895
Yeah. We don't know each other
that well yet, but like,

54:25.962 --> 54:28.598
there's so much time and
I'm just excited to...

54:28.665 --> 54:31.067
to take advantage of that and...

54:31.134 --> 54:33.470
and see...

54:33.536 --> 54:35.472
where this goes.

54:35.538 --> 54:36.873
Do you, do you see...

54:36.940 --> 54:41.544
Do you see some potential here?
- I mean, yeah.

54:41.611 --> 54:45.148
I'm excited to get to know
you more and figure out

54:45.215 --> 54:48.051
who you are and
what makes you...

54:48.118 --> 54:50.720
you know, happy in life,
what makes you tick.

54:50.787 --> 54:51.955
What your passions are.

54:52.022 --> 54:57.927
I feel like it's just very early
on in the game to be like...

54:57.994 --> 55:02.098
Yeah, it's like, I'm just
kind of like, it's like...

55:02.165 --> 55:04.167
- A navigation check.
- Yeah!

55:04.234 --> 55:05.669
- Are we...
- Checking in.

55:05.735 --> 55:07.470
Are we heading
in the right direction?

55:07.537 --> 55:09.439
- I love that.
- It's not like...

55:09.506 --> 55:11.841
I think so.
Do you think so?

55:11.908 --> 55:13.977
- Yeah, I mean, I-
- Yeah, this is, this is crazy.

55:14.044 --> 55:15.645
This is crazy.

55:15.712 --> 55:19.582
I don't want to go forward
in a relationship with Stacy

55:19.649 --> 55:23.453
if I feel that she's not the
best option for me.

55:23.520 --> 55:26.589
So, I need, I need to
understand the connections

55:26.656 --> 55:28.091
that I've had
with other people.

55:28.158 --> 55:32.128
I'm conflicted...
I'm conflicted.

55:32.195 --> 55:33.229
Excuse me for a minute.

55:33.296 --> 55:34.964
There's just another
conversation I need to have.

55:35.031 --> 55:37.634
- Sounds good.
- Yeah...

55:37.701 --> 55:40.837
Are you a dog, dogs in the
bed kind of person?

55:40.904 --> 55:43.440
No, because my dogs are huge.

55:43.506 --> 55:47.877
And, I have like really bad
OCD with like cleanliness.

55:47.944 --> 55:50.580
- Okay.
- Hey, Chris.

55:50.647 --> 55:51.781
- How are you?
- Good.

55:51.848 --> 55:53.883
Ladies... gentlemen.

55:53.950 --> 55:55.085
Tonight's...

55:55.151 --> 55:57.153
a very interesting night.
It's our first rose ceremony.

55:57.220 --> 56:00.623
And, there's some conversations
that need to be had.

56:00.690 --> 56:03.960
Caitlin, would you mind if I
steal you away and have a chat?

56:04.027 --> 56:05.962
What the hell.

56:06.029 --> 56:08.031
Don't worry.

56:08.098 --> 56:12.469
I have a secure rose for her.

56:12.535 --> 56:14.804
You know, like, he's just
boiling my blood.

56:14.871 --> 56:16.806
We're gonna go to
the other side.

56:16.873 --> 56:20.643
We could be this dynamic duo
that just go out and conquer

56:20.710 --> 56:22.879
the world and raise an
incredible family.

56:22.946 --> 56:26.483
Are you interested in
exploring what we had?

56:33.656 --> 56:35.792
- How you feeling?
- I'm...

56:35.859 --> 56:37.994
I'm overwhelmed.
Honestly, I'm overwhelmed.

56:38.061 --> 56:41.131
Like, me and Kit are going...

56:41.197 --> 56:42.565
You guys are pretty strong, man.

56:42.632 --> 56:43.933
We're going, like,
it's going well.

56:44.000 --> 56:45.068
You can't make a change tonight.

56:45.135 --> 56:46.903
You gotta go with who you're
gonna go with tonight.

56:46.970 --> 56:48.805
No, no, definitely Kit's
getting my-

56:48.872 --> 56:51.241
Kit's getting my rose,
there's no doubt about that.

56:51.307 --> 56:54.110
But at the same time, you know
what I mean, love...

56:54.177 --> 56:56.546
I'm trying to find my one,
you know what I mean?

56:56.613 --> 56:58.481
And I'll do what I have
to do to find that.

56:58.548 --> 57:01.618
-
- You know what I mean?

57:01.684 --> 57:04.554
But now I'm like-
this is a lot to think about.

57:04.621 --> 57:07.824
- I get it, I get it.
- Dios mio!

57:07.891 --> 57:09.225
Come on!

57:09.292 --> 57:12.629
Piggyback me into that!
Hold my drink, hold my drink!

57:12.695 --> 57:16.733
Dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah...

57:20.236 --> 57:21.638
Yo!

57:24.641 --> 57:25.975
Have you seen Caitlin?

57:26.042 --> 57:28.511
Yeah, Caitlin went with Chris.

57:28.578 --> 57:31.714
́Cause you guys have been
spending time together?

57:31.781 --> 57:34.951
I'm not, like, it doesn't-
does it make me nervous?

57:35.018 --> 57:37.253
Yeah.
Does it upset me? No.

57:37.320 --> 57:38.855
It's early. It's...

57:38.922 --> 57:40.190
You know?

57:40.256 --> 57:42.292
Do I want his rose?
Of course, I do.

57:42.358 --> 57:44.093
Have we been
connecting? Yes.

57:44.160 --> 57:48.598
If Chris goes first and he
gives his rose to Caitlin...?

57:48.665 --> 57:51.668
Yeah... Yeah.

57:54.137 --> 57:56.072
You're not a runner up, baby.
You're a main course.

57:56.139 --> 57:57.240
I'm a main course.

57:57.307 --> 57:59.776
got myself out of that
triangle earlier.

57:59.843 --> 58:01.578
You're a dessert!
You are every-

58:01.644 --> 58:05.248
- 1st, 2nd, 3rd.
- 14-course meal, baby!

58:05.315 --> 58:08.952
At this point, Chris did tell me
he was gonna give me the rose.

58:09.018 --> 58:12.589
But, anything can happen
at rose ceremonies.

58:12.655 --> 58:16.793
Um, I'm trying to just be like
really intentional tonight.

58:16.860 --> 58:21.164
And like, after we sort of
had our moment,

58:21.231 --> 58:23.099
I felt a very strong-

58:23.166 --> 58:26.135
unexpected very strong
connection with you.

58:26.202 --> 58:29.873
And, a very different kind of
connection with Stacy and you.

58:29.939 --> 58:33.209
And, I'm very
conflicted right now.

58:33.276 --> 58:34.377
Caitlin never came
and talked to me

58:34.444 --> 58:37.280
about moving on with Kamil.
She never closed the door,

58:37.347 --> 58:39.916
so I have every right to have a
conversation with her about it.

58:39.983 --> 58:43.286
We could be this dynamic duo
that just go out and

58:43.353 --> 58:46.055
conquer the world, and raise
an incredible family and

58:46.122 --> 58:48.258
do big things.

58:48.324 --> 58:53.963
Are you interested in
exploring what we had?

58:54.030 --> 58:56.966
Yeah, we had a great day
a couple days ago,

58:57.033 --> 58:58.868
and we spent a lot
of time together.

58:58.935 --> 59:01.104
But like...

59:01.170 --> 59:03.106
We don't have unlimited time.
- Right.

59:03.172 --> 59:06.109
So, do you feel
anything towards me?

59:09.078 --> 59:11.781
I don't know.

59:11.848 --> 59:14.117
If Kamil wasn't in the picture?

59:14.183 --> 59:17.086
You can't do that ́cause he is.

59:17.153 --> 59:20.223
No, if he wasn't,
what you did feel,

59:20.290 --> 59:23.126
would it be enough for us to
continue exploring?

59:23.192 --> 59:26.696
If he wasn't then, you know,
I would be hoping that

59:26.763 --> 59:28.731
a rose would be
coming from you.

59:33.803 --> 59:35.271
Okay.

59:35.338 --> 59:36.940
Was it real, what we felt?

59:37.006 --> 59:40.710
Was there something
mutual there, or...?

59:40.777 --> 59:41.878
Hey.

59:41.945 --> 59:44.681
Kamil, just give me one more
minute. And I'll, I'll...

59:44.747 --> 59:46.149
Caitlin, how do you feel?

59:48.251 --> 59:52.855
Ugh. I never want to be
sitting between two guys.

59:52.922 --> 59:54.657
Oh, my God, this is so brutal.

1:00:01.798 --> 1:00:03.166
If Kamil wasn't
in the picture...

1:00:03.232 --> 1:00:06.970
If he wasn't then, you know,
I would be hoping that

1:00:07.036 --> 1:00:08.905
a rose would be
coming from you.

1:00:14.143 --> 1:00:17.113
Okay. Was it real,
what we felt?

1:00:17.180 --> 1:00:20.283
Was there something
mutual there, or...?

1:00:20.350 --> 1:00:22.986
Yeah, I think everything
that was felt-

1:00:23.052 --> 1:00:26.255
everything that's been felt
here has been, but...

1:00:26.322 --> 1:00:27.123
Hey.

1:00:27.190 --> 1:00:28.191
Kamil, just give me
one more minute.

1:00:28.257 --> 1:00:31.394
- And I'll, I'll...
- Caitlin, how do you feel?

1:00:34.831 --> 1:00:36.833
Oh, my God, this is so brutal.

1:00:36.899 --> 1:00:39.302
The question is whether or not
the door is closed or not.

1:00:43.373 --> 1:00:45.708
I feel like you might be
looking for an answer that I,

1:00:45.775 --> 1:00:48.011
I don't think I can give.

1:00:48.077 --> 1:00:50.213
All day today,
he talked about Stacy.

1:00:50.279 --> 1:00:54.150
Stacy, Stacy, Stacy.
And, Stacy's sitting by herself.

1:00:54.217 --> 1:00:56.953
It's like, why are you wasting
your time on Caitlin?

1:00:57.020 --> 1:01:01.391
Like, there's no chance in hell
he's getting her.

1:01:01.457 --> 1:01:03.359
Like, you know what
she feels towards me.

1:01:03.426 --> 1:01:07.130
Okay. It's okay. Yeah.

1:01:07.196 --> 1:01:08.698
Caitlin!

1:01:11.401 --> 1:01:15.038
I've had so many things...

1:01:15.104 --> 1:01:17.140
taken from me...

1:01:17.206 --> 1:01:19.308
because I didn't know...

1:01:19.375 --> 1:01:22.378
how to fight.

1:01:22.445 --> 1:01:25.715
And, that's not the kind of
life I want to live.

1:01:31.320 --> 1:01:33.289
The rose ceremony's tonight.

1:01:33.356 --> 1:01:35.792
And, he's butting in
for no reason.

1:01:35.858 --> 1:01:39.862
I think Chris' chances
are zero. Like, zero.

1:01:41.864 --> 1:01:44.467
I'm, I'm really just
ready to snap.

1:01:44.534 --> 1:01:48.171
What the...?
Kamil?

1:01:48.237 --> 1:01:49.839
Take a seat.

1:01:54.110 --> 1:01:56.512
You see us together
every single day.

1:01:56.579 --> 1:01:57.580
Right.

1:01:57.647 --> 1:02:00.083
And, we're making out,
we're holding hands.

1:02:00.149 --> 1:02:03.252
Why are you like trying to
come in for my girl?

1:02:03.319 --> 1:02:06.889
I'm holding my ground.
This is the new Chris.

1:02:06.956 --> 1:02:08.958
And I'm not letting people
push me around.

1:02:09.025 --> 1:02:10.426
I'm gonna go after
what I want,

1:02:10.493 --> 1:02:13.963
and I'm not gonna let
anybody intimidate me.

1:02:14.030 --> 1:02:15.331
She's not your girl.

1:02:15.398 --> 1:02:17.500
What do you mean,
she's not my girl?

1:02:17.567 --> 1:02:20.536
I had a very strong
connection with Caitlin.

1:02:20.603 --> 1:02:21.704
And I just, I just
can't ignore that.

1:02:21.771 --> 1:02:24.507
I can't walk- I just can't
walk away from that.

1:02:24.574 --> 1:02:26.509
The connection is terminated.

1:02:26.576 --> 1:02:29.345
- Who says that?
- What are you, blind?

1:02:30.613 --> 1:02:32.515
I mean, like,
it's blatant, man. Like...

1:02:32.582 --> 1:02:34.917
It's not, it's not,
it's not definite.

1:02:34.984 --> 1:02:36.819
Anybody can walk down that
dock at any moment.

1:02:36.886 --> 1:02:37.954
I agree, I agree.

1:02:38.020 --> 1:02:40.857
But for this moment,
she's my girl.

1:02:40.923 --> 1:02:43.159
- I still feel something.
- Alright, I get it, I get it.

1:02:43.226 --> 1:02:46.162
I get it. Chris! You can
feel it for forever,

1:02:46.229 --> 1:02:48.865
but she's not
reciprocating that. To you.

1:02:48.931 --> 1:02:49.999
You're kind of starting to
piss me off a bit.

1:02:50.066 --> 1:02:51.200
You're pissing me off a bit.

1:02:51.267 --> 1:02:54.904
I wanted to know if what I
was feeling was legitimate and

1:02:54.971 --> 1:02:56.405
genuine interest
́cause we kissed.

1:02:56.472 --> 1:02:59.242
- What about Stacy?
- Man, you know what-

1:02:59.308 --> 1:03:01.811
It's right before rose
ceremony, man.

1:03:01.878 --> 1:03:03.379
Eye to eye, let's talk like men.

1:03:03.446 --> 1:03:06.315
I'm not letting people
walk over me.

1:03:06.382 --> 1:03:10.086
They're gonna feel a burn.
They're gonna get some scars.

1:03:10.153 --> 1:03:11.854
It's gonna get scrappy.

1:03:11.921 --> 1:03:13.456
- Listen, listen to me.
- Alright.

1:03:13.523 --> 1:03:16.125
In order to gauge how I feel
about someone else,

1:03:16.192 --> 1:03:18.094
I need to understand the
connections I've had.

1:03:18.161 --> 1:03:19.529
- Kamil.
- Chris.

1:03:19.595 --> 1:03:22.098
I wanted to know
what she did feel.

1:03:22.165 --> 1:03:23.399
It's my process.

1:03:23.466 --> 1:03:24.567
So, what are you
gonna do tonight?

1:03:24.634 --> 1:03:25.535
You know what, dude,
I'm done here.

1:03:25.601 --> 1:03:28.070
Like, what about the
connection with Stacy?

1:03:28.137 --> 1:03:31.474
Who are you gonna pick tonight?

1:03:31.541 --> 1:03:33.109
Who are you gonna pick?

1:03:34.577 --> 1:03:36.312
Who are you gonna pick?

1:03:36.379 --> 1:03:38.414
I'm gonna fight for what I want.

1:03:38.481 --> 1:03:40.416
I'm not gonna let
someone just take it.

1:03:50.626 --> 1:03:53.429
<i>Coming up next time, on
Bachelor in Paradise Canada.</i>

1:03:53.496 --> 1:03:55.631
Welcome to the first-ever
rose ceremony

1:03:55.698 --> 1:03:58.401
in Canadian
Paradise history.

1:03:58.467 --> 1:04:00.570
Chris wants Caitlin.
It's not happening.

1:04:00.636 --> 1:04:02.538
I'm just so emotionally
exhausted.

1:04:02.605 --> 1:04:05.274
I don't feel the fight.
Ugh...

1:04:07.944 --> 1:04:09.946
- Oh!
- A newcomer coming.

1:04:11.414 --> 1:04:12.949
Oh, my god, he's a Greek god.

1:04:13.015 --> 1:04:15.218
Who's this coming in?

1:04:15.284 --> 1:04:17.386
How many guys are gonna be here?

1:04:17.453 --> 1:04:20.890
Guys no longer in the power.
I don't like it.

1:04:20.957 --> 1:04:24.093
There's a lot of guys that are
trying to prove to the women

1:04:24.160 --> 1:04:26.629
that they deserve a rose.

1:04:26.696 --> 1:04:28.497
Let the best man win.

1:04:28.564 --> 1:04:33.169
They're spinning.
Unpredictable, these women.

1:04:33.236 --> 1:04:35.938
You know, I definitely have
feelings for Angela.

1:04:36.005 --> 1:04:38.474
And then I also have these
feelings for you too.

1:04:38.541 --> 1:04:42.044
I'm at a crossroads when it
comes to Angela and Stacy.

1:04:42.111 --> 1:04:44.046
Brendan M.'s making
me look stupid.

1:04:44.113 --> 1:04:45.514
It's bullshit.
I'm annoyed.

1:04:45.581 --> 1:04:46.949
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1:04:47.016 --> 1:04:49.252
Vay and Kamil are
sitting at the bar,

1:04:49.318 --> 1:04:53.289
and I don't like watching
her with him, at all.

1:04:53.356 --> 1:04:54.257
Where's your cowboy?

1:04:54.323 --> 1:04:55.958
I know in real you
wouldn't go for him.

1:04:56.025 --> 1:04:56.826
Who would you see me with?

1:04:56.893 --> 1:04:58.527
No one that's
available right now.

1:04:58.594 --> 1:05:00.563
What does that mean, Kamil?

1:05:00.630 --> 1:05:05.001
Vay had a talk with Kamil about
how you're really not her type.

1:05:05.067 --> 1:05:08.104
Not a chance this guy's
getting away scot free!

1:05:08.170 --> 1:05:11.407
Why did you even say, "You know
what, how's things with Joey?"

1:05:11.474 --> 1:05:12.475
Why not?

1:05:12.541 --> 1:05:15.678
Ooh, shit!

1:05:15.745 --> 1:05:17.947
Uh-oh, trouble in Paradise.

1:05:21.584 --> 1:05:23.319
Hot?

1:05:23.386 --> 1:05:25.321
Oh, I've been cooking
by that fire!

1:05:27.423 --> 1:05:30.459
I felt the heat building up,
and people are talking to me.

1:05:30.526 --> 1:05:35.631
And, I'm trying to interact,
but I'm just getting too hot.

1:05:35.698 --> 1:05:37.233
I mean, great sweater.

1:05:37.300 --> 1:05:38.467
Did your brother
actually knit it?

1:05:38.534 --> 1:05:39.669
100%, I'm not lying, yeah.

1:05:39.735 --> 1:05:42.371
Love my brother for it,
but whoo!

1:05:43.639 --> 1:05:46.108
Honestly, I can't even hear the
questions at this point.

1:05:46.175 --> 1:05:48.411
I'm just hot because this
sweater and this fire.

1:05:48.477 --> 1:05:49.278
Just take it off.

1:05:49.345 --> 1:05:51.681
I'm like 10 seconds
away from it.

1:05:51.747 --> 1:05:54.383
I don't want to be the guy that
takes my shirt off at a fire.

1:05:55.818 --> 1:05:57.586
But, I'm gonna be the
guy that takes

1:05:57.653 --> 1:05:59.088
his shirt off
at the campfire.

1:05:59.155 --> 1:06:01.290
- You're still sweating.
- Oh, yeah.
