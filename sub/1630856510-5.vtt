WEBVTT

00:00.360 --> 00:01.400
(tense music)

00:01.400 --> 00:04.640
(electricity buzzing)

00:05.800 --> 00:07.240
[Batra] Well, this is
clearly a sophisticated

00:07.240 --> 00:09.000
terrorist attack.
- Stop!

00:09.000 --> 00:11.680
(explosion booms)

00:11.680 --> 00:13.360
[Hassan] And you had to
be the one to run after.

00:13.360 --> 00:15.240
Could just do without you making my life

00:15.240 --> 00:17.080
any harder than it is right now.

00:17.080 --> 00:18.680
We have reason to
believe that this event

00:18.680 --> 00:21.120
has been targeted by a
violent terrorist group.

00:22.200 --> 00:25.040
(panels clanking)

00:28.440 --> 00:30.280
(explosion booms)

00:30.280 --> 00:33.720
That bomb removed by my team
would've flattened your house

00:33.720 --> 00:36.120
and killed everyone in it.
- Understood.

00:36.120 --> 00:37.800
I've had enough of
dancing to their tune.

00:37.800 --> 00:39.800
And we'll start by
bringing Alex into custody.

00:39.800 --> 00:41.160
I'm not one of them. I'm not part of it.

00:41.160 --> 00:42.280
I'm just a tech guy.

00:42.280 --> 00:43.320
[Lana] We need to know
what they're planning next.

00:43.320 --> 00:46.440
It could be anything. They're
messing with your heads.

00:46.440 --> 00:47.480
If you've got any feelings

00:47.480 --> 00:50.800
or anything on your plate
that you wanna talk about,

00:50.800 --> 00:53.320
then you know I'm here, yeah?

00:55.440 --> 00:58.200
My daughter died. She
was being bullied online.

00:58.200 --> 00:59.400
She took her own life.

00:59.400 --> 01:02.880
The police, well, they
didn't do a damn thing.

01:02.880 --> 01:05.080
Start by telling me everything you know.

01:06.080 --> 01:08.600
(tense music)

01:42.360 --> 01:44.880
(tense music)

02:00.360 --> 02:02.960
(door squeaks)

02:04.840 --> 02:07.320
(tense music)

02:11.360 --> 02:13.880
(tense music)

02:21.080 --> 02:24.400
(tense music increases)

02:35.120 --> 02:38.040
Alex gave me a verbal
description of each gang member,

02:38.040 --> 02:41.920
and they're led by a woman, suspect A.

02:41.920 --> 02:43.880
I can run the description
through our date bases.

02:43.880 --> 02:44.760
[Lana] Ta.

02:44.760 --> 02:47.160
So Alex turned up on your doorstep?

02:47.160 --> 02:49.920
Yeah. Last night, asking for help.

02:49.920 --> 02:52.200
And he's risking his life to help us.

02:52.200 --> 02:55.560
I gave a clear order.
I wanted him brought in.

02:55.560 --> 02:57.200
Yes, sir.

02:57.200 --> 02:59.760
Look, if he approaches
you again, you call it in.

02:59.760 --> 03:02.560
If you hear anything
from him, you call it in.

03:02.560 --> 03:04.320
I don't care if it's hard
to speak in front of him.

03:04.320 --> 03:07.240
You find a way to communicate
with us. Do you understand?

03:07.240 --> 03:08.680
Yes, sir. Understood.

03:08.680 --> 03:09.760
[John] All right,
share these descriptions

03:09.760 --> 03:10.720
with the other agencies.

03:10.720 --> 03:12.800
Sonya, what else have we got?

03:12.800 --> 03:14.040
Uh, we've been able to pinpoint

03:14.040 --> 03:16.800
that the RDX likely originated in Poland.

03:16.800 --> 03:18.440
They have a well-developed black market.

03:18.440 --> 03:20.040
It's easy to source.

03:20.040 --> 03:23.480
Importing RDX into this
country is not as easy.

03:23.480 --> 03:25.920
It means having people at strategic points

03:25.920 --> 03:27.240
both here and in Eastern Europe.

03:27.240 --> 03:30.360
Uh, we've been talking to
Polish counter intelligence ABW.

03:30.360 --> 03:32.840
They've been tracking
an illegal arms dealer.

03:32.840 --> 03:34.120
Now, about a year ago,

03:34.120 --> 03:35.440
they obtained footage

03:35.440 --> 03:39.240
of their target speaking to Nicholas Hood,

03:39.240 --> 03:41.080
our power station bomber,

03:41.080 --> 03:44.120
when he was in Poland
for his chess tournament.

03:44.120 --> 03:45.680
They shared the video within Interpol,

03:45.680 --> 03:48.120
but since Nick's nationality
was then unknown,

03:48.120 --> 03:50.760
it hasn't been flagged
with UKIC until now.

03:50.760 --> 03:54.320
And look. A woman.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.400
Well, could this be the same woman

03:57.400 --> 03:59.760
who killed DCI Youngblood, suspect A?

03:59.760 --> 04:02.360
Oh, GCHQ can do a
biometric analysis. Yeah.

04:03.320 --> 04:06.000
- [John] And who's that?
- Suspect B.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.640
We'll crosscheck the suspects

04:07.640 --> 04:09.560
with the CCTV from the crime scene

04:09.560 --> 04:11.280
in the hours leading up to each attack.

04:11.280 --> 04:13.080
Okay, circulate the image of suspect B

04:13.080 --> 04:14.600
to every officer on the force.

04:14.600 --> 04:16.440
I want an all patrol ops.

04:16.440 --> 04:18.000
But what about press, social media?

04:18.000 --> 04:19.080
No, if we tip the public off,

04:19.080 --> 04:21.480
they'll go to ground and
we'll never catch them.

04:21.480 --> 04:23.720
The element of surprise
is our strongest play.

04:23.720 --> 04:27.960
And remember, the order is
report, follow. Do not detain.

04:27.960 --> 04:30.240
- On it, sir.
- Sir.

04:30.240 --> 04:32.200
The one connection between
all the Wave attacks

04:32.200 --> 04:35.280
is Webster King whose house
was nearly destroyed yesterday.

04:35.280 --> 04:37.560
Yeah, our financial crime
specialists are on the case,

04:37.560 --> 04:40.600
but Webster King has
interests in the power station

04:40.600 --> 04:43.360
and was owner via the
British Virgin Islands

04:43.360 --> 04:45.880
of the Tritia Global
Analytics data company.

04:45.880 --> 04:46.720
So?

04:46.720 --> 04:49.360
So he was also former business partner

04:49.360 --> 04:51.600
of Cabinet Minister Matthew Polfrey

04:51.600 --> 04:52.920
and owner of Bullion Wharf,

04:52.920 --> 04:54.560
the scene of the scooter attack.

04:54.560 --> 04:55.920
He could provide insight

04:55.920 --> 04:58.040
into the gang's next potential target.

05:00.520 --> 05:02.520
Let me deal with Webster King.

05:04.320 --> 05:06.840
(tense music)

05:12.160 --> 05:15.680
(person knocking)

05:15.680 --> 05:18.840
It'll take more than a bomb to stop me.

05:18.840 --> 05:20.920
Thanks for calling.

05:24.400 --> 05:26.960
Okay. Commander.

05:26.960 --> 05:28.320
- [John] Sir.
- Thanks for coming.

05:28.320 --> 05:31.680
I'm sorry if I wasn't fully
appreciative yesterday.

05:31.680 --> 05:35.640
It was a close call.
Your team saved my life.

05:35.640 --> 05:38.200
Well, uh, that's what
we're here for, sir.

05:38.200 --> 05:40.280
Do you have any leads?

05:41.280 --> 05:43.480
We have one man in custody.

05:43.480 --> 05:46.800
The attackers appear to be
revolutionary anti-capitalists.

05:46.800 --> 05:49.240
The militant wokerati.

05:49.240 --> 05:51.360
Indeed.

05:51.360 --> 05:53.160
We do wonder,

05:53.160 --> 05:56.040
why do you think they're
singling you out in particular?

05:57.440 --> 05:59.400
So many business
people these days pretend

05:59.400 --> 06:02.840
to buy into all that ethical green crap.

06:02.840 --> 06:03.680
But I'm honest.

06:03.680 --> 06:05.040
When it comes to making money,

06:05.040 --> 06:07.120
you have to get your hands dirty.

06:07.120 --> 06:09.200
So these attacks are personal.

06:09.800 --> 06:11.480
When I take over a failing company,

06:11.480 --> 06:13.160
you have to cut back a lot of dead wood.

06:13.160 --> 06:15.080
[John] Which would create some enemies.

06:15.080 --> 06:17.160
Winners always have enemies.

06:17.800 --> 06:20.160
My assistant tells me I
get a lot of hate mail.

06:20.160 --> 06:22.200
I'll have her share it with you.

06:22.200 --> 06:25.400
Of course if it's all the same to you,

06:25.400 --> 06:27.760
my wife is very keen
we take our honeymoon.

06:27.760 --> 06:30.680
I've got a small island in the Adriatic.

06:30.680 --> 06:33.920
It's pretty safe there.
She was a bit shaken.

06:35.680 --> 06:37.640
Yes, of course.
(cellphone rings)

06:37.640 --> 06:40.040
- [Webster] That's her now.
- It's quite understandable.

06:41.200 --> 06:44.080
We'll be flying tomorrow.
Don't hesitate to get in touch.

06:44.080 --> 06:46.200
Of course I wanna know
about any developments

06:46.200 --> 06:48.400
and I am most anxious to help.

06:50.200 --> 06:52.520
The home secretary speaks
very highly of you.

06:52.520 --> 06:55.000
Commissioner material she thought.

06:55.000 --> 06:59.360
Thank you, sir. Uh, that's,
uh, that's very generous.

07:02.600 --> 07:04.800
[Officer] It's the best angle we've got.

07:04.800 --> 07:07.080
Coming from this direction.

07:07.080 --> 07:09.840
[Helen] Sir, what have you got?

07:09.840 --> 07:11.480
Well, initially nothing,

07:11.480 --> 07:13.720
but we just widened the
parameters around the search again

07:13.720 --> 07:15.160
and look, see.

07:15.160 --> 07:17.120
From Bullion Wharf,

07:17.120 --> 07:19.320
the CCTV cameras in the immediate vicinity

07:19.320 --> 07:21.320
were disabled for the actual attack.

07:21.320 --> 07:23.760
So we checked approximately 20 minutes

07:23.760 --> 07:25.840
before the scooter bomb.

07:26.440 --> 07:27.680
[Helen] It's the same guy.

07:27.680 --> 07:30.160
Yeah. Yeah, it is. Suspect B

07:30.160 --> 07:32.240
Sir.

07:35.600 --> 07:37.600
Hello.

07:38.120 --> 07:41.600
(speaks foreign language)

07:43.320 --> 07:45.720
We've got a second property
leased to Nick Hood.

07:48.040 --> 07:49.440
[Officer On Radio]
Central 35 to all units.

07:49.440 --> 07:52.600
RVTs, Arkham Road, SW19.

07:52.600 --> 07:54.240
High risk of IED.

07:54.240 --> 07:56.480
(sirens drown out radio)

07:56.480 --> 07:59.280
(sirens blaring)

08:25.120 --> 08:26.760
So he rents out a few properties.

08:26.760 --> 08:28.280
The scooter bombs caught his attention

08:28.280 --> 08:31.400
and he recognised Nick
Hood from the photograph.

08:31.400 --> 08:33.640
Hood has been a tenant
for about 12 months.

08:35.080 --> 08:37.520
Yeah.

08:37.520 --> 08:40.080
(tense music)

08:54.960 --> 08:56.920
Letter box is glued shut.

08:56.920 --> 08:59.000
I can't see anything behind the door.

09:01.280 --> 09:03.520
We're gonna need access to the rear.

09:03.520 --> 09:06.080
(tense music)

09:12.160 --> 09:14.920
(insect buzzing)

09:44.560 --> 09:47.160
(door rattles)

09:49.040 --> 09:51.560
(tense music)

10:08.720 --> 10:10.720
Absence of wires on entry.

10:13.480 --> 10:16.080
(gate rattles)

10:29.840 --> 10:32.040
Well, it looks like no one's living here.

10:34.640 --> 10:37.400
And we've got what looks like
a brand new filing cabinet

10:37.400 --> 10:39.480
in the middle of a kitchen.

10:43.280 --> 10:46.600
(drill buzzing)

10:46.600 --> 10:49.680
(suspenseful music)

11:01.120 --> 11:03.640
We've got a lot of paperwork in draw two.

11:06.800 --> 11:09.760
I can see a driving
licence, but it's face down.

11:13.160 --> 11:16.200
I'm gonna send you some
screenshots. Hold on.

11:16.200 --> 11:18.000
Understood. Take your time.

11:18.000 --> 11:20.760
(camera clicks)

11:23.880 --> 11:26.480
(drill buzzes)

11:32.640 --> 11:37.840
Shit. Expo two to all
units. We have IED contact.

11:37.840 --> 11:39.720
Light sensitive switch attached.

11:39.720 --> 11:41.320
I'm gonna have to use the expanding foam.

11:41.320 --> 11:43.400
We need to cover the LDR.

11:43.720 --> 11:46.240
(tense music)

12:05.640 --> 12:08.440
(spray whooshing)

12:10.480 --> 12:13.000
(tense music)

12:16.520 --> 12:18.200
Expo two to all units.

12:18.200 --> 12:20.480
LDR is covered, but the
device is still live.

12:20.480 --> 12:22.600
This is just a temporary fix.

12:22.600 --> 12:25.880
All units to wait out until neutralised.

12:25.880 --> 12:28.480
(tense music)

12:54.320 --> 12:56.880
I've been monitoring
internal police coms

12:56.880 --> 12:58.960
and look whose photo they've got.

13:00.280 --> 13:01.680
Where is he?

13:01.680 --> 13:02.960
[Gang Member 1] He's
gone to get supplies.

13:02.960 --> 13:04.800
We need to get him back here now.

13:04.800 --> 13:05.880
Okay.

13:05.880 --> 13:08.440
(tense music)

13:16.680 --> 13:17.760
[Lana] This driving licence...

13:17.760 --> 13:18.600
Yeah?

13:18.600 --> 13:20.120
It's got the name Mark Griffiths on it,

13:20.120 --> 13:22.200
but Nick Hood's mugshot.

13:23.440 --> 13:25.800
All right. Yeah, good work, Lana.

13:27.040 --> 13:32.080
Glad I could help.
(cellphone chimes)

13:32.080 --> 13:35.040
Lana, we gotta make a move.

13:35.040 --> 13:37.120
Uh, yeah, two minutes.

13:37.120 --> 13:39.200
We'll turn 'em in soon.
- All right.

13:48.520 --> 13:49.680
[Val] Hello, it's Val.

13:49.680 --> 13:51.920
Please leave a message after the tone.

13:51.920 --> 13:54.000
I'll get back to you. Bye.

13:58.280 --> 13:59.840
It was a victim operated device

13:59.840 --> 14:01.600
using a light dependent resistor.

14:01.600 --> 14:03.440
A bit like what we saw
with the collar bomb.

14:03.440 --> 14:04.520
Right, well, neighbours we spoke to

14:04.520 --> 14:06.560
suggest it was only Nick coming and going

14:06.560 --> 14:08.200
occasionally during the day.

14:08.200 --> 14:10.440
So the driving licence you found

14:10.440 --> 14:11.720
in the name Mark Griffiths

14:11.720 --> 14:14.040
was used to rent a van
from a van hire company

14:14.040 --> 14:17.280
in Streatham the day after
Nick returned from Poland.

14:17.280 --> 14:20.040
We then tracked the van
from Streatham to Scotland

14:20.040 --> 14:21.520
where he drives onto the ferry

14:21.520 --> 14:23.480
from Stranraer to Belfast.

14:23.480 --> 14:25.160
We then tracked its
route down to Enniskillen

14:25.160 --> 14:26.840
close to the Irish border,

14:26.840 --> 14:28.200
but we then lose sight of the van

14:28.200 --> 14:32.120
for approximately two hours
before it reappears on camera,

14:32.120 --> 14:33.440
heading back up north to Belfast.

14:33.440 --> 14:35.600
- Was he alone?
- On the way there, yes.

14:35.600 --> 14:37.760
On the way back, there was
someone else behind the wheel,

14:37.760 --> 14:39.120
and the speed cameras picked them up

14:39.120 --> 14:41.320
on the M1 just outside of Belfast.

14:41.320 --> 14:43.040
That looks like suspect B to me.

14:43.040 --> 14:45.320
- Agreed. Any GPS data?
- No use.

14:45.320 --> 14:46.360
These guys are too consistent.

14:46.360 --> 14:49.400
They're swapping out sim cards,
burner phones, et cetera.

14:49.400 --> 14:50.800
What about the two hour window?

14:50.800 --> 14:52.720
I'm liaising with the Guarder.

14:52.720 --> 14:54.800
Good work.

14:55.240 --> 14:57.240
Good work.

15:01.240 --> 15:02.400
[Val] Hello, it's Val.

15:02.400 --> 15:04.640
Please leave a message after the tone.

15:04.640 --> 15:06.720
I'll get back to you. Bye.

15:07.320 --> 15:11.000
Hi, Mum. It's me. Um,
listen, I'm sorry. I-

15:11.000 --> 15:13.520
Lana, possible sighting of suspect B

15:13.520 --> 15:15.600
in a hardware store in East London.

15:18.720 --> 15:19.760
[Officer On Radio]
Central 35 to all units.

15:19.760 --> 15:22.520
Suspect have been tracked to
Fullbrook Industrial Estate.

15:22.520 --> 15:24.160
Standby to deploy.

15:24.160 --> 15:26.320
He's taken us straight to 'em.

15:26.320 --> 15:28.200
[Officer On Radio] Be advised,
the suspect is likely armed

15:28.200 --> 15:29.920
and considered extremely dangerous.

15:29.920 --> 15:32.520
(tense music)

15:47.640 --> 15:49.640
Let's move in. Go, go, go.

15:56.520 --> 15:58.520
Hello.

16:06.400 --> 16:09.400
Hello.
(tense music)

16:24.760 --> 16:29.440
I've got the stuff. I'm at
the warehouse. Where are you?

16:30.400 --> 16:33.880
[Gang Member 2] I'm sorry.
(suspenseful music)

16:38.000 --> 16:43.000
Shit!
(suspenseful music)

16:44.800 --> 16:47.640
(explosion rings)

16:54.240 --> 16:57.440
We lose sight of Hood in
his van near the border,

16:57.440 --> 17:00.720
but two hours later he's captured
making the return journey.

17:00.720 --> 17:02.800
We think that he might've
collected explosives

17:02.800 --> 17:04.520
trafficked from Poland.

17:04.520 --> 17:07.280
We've got no intel beyond
him arriving at the border.

17:07.280 --> 17:08.200
Any ideas?

17:08.200 --> 17:11.720
If you're crossing the
border at Black Lion on the A4,

17:11.720 --> 17:13.920
there's a small port at Sligo,

17:13.920 --> 17:18.320
which is a 40 minute drive
or an hour 20 there and back.

17:18.320 --> 17:19.160
Fits your timeframe.

17:19.160 --> 17:22.800
There's no time to come
by sea. What about air?

17:22.800 --> 17:24.840
There's Knock International Airport,

17:24.840 --> 17:28.040
but it's an hour 30 drive
once you cross the border.

17:29.120 --> 17:33.000
Um, Hood picked up a passenger
at some point, suspect B.

17:33.000 --> 17:36.360
I got the images you sent.

17:36.360 --> 17:39.720
We'll get onto the airport
for you. See what we can find.

17:39.720 --> 17:42.520
(sirens blaring)

17:53.200 --> 17:55.720
Yeah, almost certainly suspect B.

17:55.720 --> 17:59.000
He's been matched to the
photos. No other suspects.

17:59.000 --> 18:01.400
Right. They obviously
knew we were wrong to him.

18:01.400 --> 18:03.480
Yeah, he was leading us back here.

18:04.480 --> 18:05.480
Well, it looks like they cleaned out.

18:05.480 --> 18:07.360
They didn't leave much behind.

18:07.360 --> 18:10.720
And because he'd become a
liability, they just took him out.

18:11.800 --> 18:15.000
Toys stuffed with explosives.
What were they planning?

18:16.840 --> 18:19.160
[Gang Member 2] Okay,
this'll work for now.

18:19.160 --> 18:21.240
[Gang Member 1] All
right, let's get on with it.

18:24.400 --> 18:26.560
[Alex] What happened to the other guy?

18:26.560 --> 18:28.400
He'd understand that the
cause is more important

18:28.400 --> 18:30.480
than any of us.

18:32.400 --> 18:33.360
And we have to lose anyone

18:33.360 --> 18:35.440
who represents a threat to our mission.

18:36.520 --> 18:38.520
(cellphone ringing)
- Who is it?

18:42.400 --> 18:46.080
Hello. Yeah. We were forced
to sabotage our operation.

18:46.080 --> 18:48.160
We had no choice.

18:51.560 --> 18:54.080
Of course. Close it down.
Whatev-Whatever you say.

18:56.520 --> 19:00.240
Yes. Uh, has the money
been paid into the account?

19:04.040 --> 19:06.040
Right. Okay. Okay.

19:13.680 --> 19:16.240
What were we needing from
the electronic store?

19:16.240 --> 19:18.680
Wifi booster. Yeah, we still need it.

19:20.880 --> 19:22.880
He could go.

19:38.640 --> 19:41.240
They're picking me up in 10
minutes. I haven't got long.

19:42.400 --> 19:44.400
One of the Wave gang members is dead.

19:47.640 --> 19:51.200
They're monitoring police
alerts, so they knew.

19:51.200 --> 19:53.280
She knew.

19:56.360 --> 19:59.160
Listen, there's someone else.

19:59.160 --> 20:02.240
Someone higher up. The money.

20:04.160 --> 20:06.280
The woman in charge got a call.

20:06.280 --> 20:08.760
Man's voice telling her to stop.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
- And will she?
- No way.

20:19.720 --> 20:21.720
I found this.

20:24.680 --> 20:26.680
Trace the money.

20:29.320 --> 20:31.800
(tense music)

20:45.080 --> 20:47.080
What are you playing at?

20:47.080 --> 20:49.080
Sir, I had to go and meet him.

20:49.080 --> 20:51.520
You disobeyed a clear order again.

20:51.520 --> 20:54.240
Like I told you before,
sir, Alex doesn't trust you.

20:54.240 --> 20:57.000
Any of you. But look,
that's not important.

20:57.000 --> 20:59.960
Suspect A is not the leader.
There's somebody higher up.

20:59.960 --> 21:01.160
That's who you need to be investigating.

21:01.160 --> 21:04.080
I expressly told you not
to meet him by yourself.

21:04.080 --> 21:06.280
That you were to find a way to contact us.

21:07.120 --> 21:09.120
I made a split second decision.

21:09.120 --> 21:12.080
He wanted to meet me alone.
You need to trace the money.

21:12.080 --> 21:14.320
Not Alex. There's somebody higher up.

21:15.640 --> 21:16.880
Is anyone listening to me?

21:16.880 --> 21:18.000
[John] Who the hell
do you think you are?

21:18.000 --> 21:20.160
Somebody that cares about saving lives,

21:20.160 --> 21:22.320
not their own career.
- Excuse me.

21:22.320 --> 21:24.680
There is someone higher up.

21:24.680 --> 21:26.880
[John] You are completely out of line.

21:26.880 --> 21:28.280
It's all political with
you anyway, isn't it?

21:28.280 --> 21:29.920
- [John] Stop.
- It's all playing games.

21:29.920 --> 21:32.080
It's all protecting
your own neck, isn't it?

21:32.080 --> 21:33.440
You don't give a shit about Alex.

21:33.440 --> 21:34.800
You don't give a shit about the victims.

21:34.800 --> 21:35.960
You don't even give a
shit about your team.

21:35.960 --> 21:36.760
Do you know what? I'm done.

21:36.760 --> 21:40.640
I'm fucking done working for
a brown nosing twat like you.

21:42.080 --> 21:44.880
There you go. You got your
job back. Knock yourself out.

21:44.880 --> 21:47.480
(tense music)

21:52.640 --> 21:55.760
Lana, wait. Lana, where
are you going? Listen-

21:55.760 --> 21:58.200
Helen, just give it a rest.
All right. We're not mates.

21:58.200 --> 21:59.840
Look, I know that. I am
just trying to help you-

21:59.840 --> 22:01.400
Stop pretending like you give a shit.

22:01.400 --> 22:04.840
Stop acting like I'm a
nice person. I'm not.

22:04.840 --> 22:06.960
You know, me and Thom, we were
gonna make a go of things.

22:06.960 --> 22:09.880
He just never got round
to telling you. Sorry.

22:33.160 --> 22:35.600
- Oh, you okay, Helen?
- Yeah. Yeah.

22:38.320 --> 22:43.040
We, uh, we still don't know
suspect B's real name yet.

22:43.040 --> 22:47.280
So, um, what about you?

22:47.280 --> 22:51.080
Yeah, the Guarder in Dublin
Counter Terror called back.

22:51.080 --> 22:53.640
He spoke to a local officer.

22:53.640 --> 22:56.040
There's a private airstrip at Birdhill,

22:56.040 --> 22:58.320
close to the border.

22:58.320 --> 23:00.200
High net worth individuals often fly in.

23:00.200 --> 23:02.200
He's just sent me a list
of all incoming flights

23:02.200 --> 23:06.120
over that time period.
- Good. Sounds promising.

23:07.920 --> 23:09.920
Also, we just spoke to GCHQ.

23:11.080 --> 23:12.640
They say that the biometric template

23:12.640 --> 23:14.720
for both images are an exact match

23:14.720 --> 23:16.720
on facial, anatomical, and gait.

23:16.720 --> 23:19.920
That means that the firefighter
caught on CCTV at Tritia

23:19.920 --> 23:21.640
is the same woman

23:21.640 --> 23:24.240
who was at the arms
dealer meeting in Cracow.

23:24.240 --> 23:26.320
They're both suspect A.

23:26.840 --> 23:28.720
And she'll be added to
a primary watch list

23:28.720 --> 23:30.320
by the authorising officer.

23:30.320 --> 23:33.400
So next time she pops
up on our system...

23:33.400 --> 23:34.560
If a probe image is submitted

23:34.560 --> 23:35.720
to the watch list and matched,

23:35.720 --> 23:37.800
an alert will be issued immediately.

23:41.560 --> 23:44.000
I'm sharing a list of passenger manifests

23:44.000 --> 23:46.120
and private planes landing
at Birdhill with you.

23:46.120 --> 23:48.200
Okay.

23:59.720 --> 24:01.240
Shit.

24:01.240 --> 24:03.320
Bloody hell.

24:04.800 --> 24:07.360
Webster King has flown
into Birdhill airstrip

24:07.360 --> 24:09.800
a total of nine times in the last year

24:09.800 --> 24:11.960
on a Bombardier Challenger jet.

24:11.960 --> 24:15.640
Flight registration number,
Golf Bravo India Foxtrot Yankee.

24:16.560 --> 24:19.760
Turns out he owns a small castle locally.

24:19.760 --> 24:21.800
Birdhill Airport is just 40 minutes

24:21.800 --> 24:24.640
from where we lose the
van driven by Nick Hood.

24:26.200 --> 24:27.800
But his name doesn't appear

24:27.800 --> 24:29.560
on the 8th of February manifest.

24:29.560 --> 24:30.920
King didn't fly in that day,

24:30.920 --> 24:33.280
but the same Challenger jet did.

24:33.280 --> 24:35.920
They spent about 20 minutes
on the runway unloading goods

24:35.920 --> 24:37.560
before departing for London City Airport.

24:37.560 --> 24:38.840
Yeah, and what's the betting

24:38.840 --> 24:41.680
that suspect B also
disembarked at Birdhill?

24:41.680 --> 24:44.680
Well, what's King's
connection to the Challenger?

24:44.680 --> 24:46.040
Does he own it?

24:46.040 --> 24:48.240
Well, it's a British plane
owned by a shell company

24:48.240 --> 24:49.920
and it's registered in Ireland.

24:49.920 --> 24:51.400
Check the flight history for...

24:51.400 --> 24:53.520
- [Batra] Uh, Golf Bravo-
- Yes, yes, yes, I know.

24:53.520 --> 24:56.440
See if the dates match with
Nick Hood's flight to Cracow.

24:58.560 --> 25:01.880
You what? But you love your job.

25:01.880 --> 25:05.440
You got what you wanted.
You hated me doing it.

25:05.440 --> 25:09.400
Yeah. Yeah. But I mean,
we've never tried to stop you.

25:09.400 --> 25:10.440
Not since the day you left.

25:10.440 --> 25:13.000
No, I left home at 16.
You never stopped me.

25:13.000 --> 25:15.480
I went to a war zone, to Afghanistan.

25:15.480 --> 25:16.920
I mean, it says it all, doesn't it?

25:16.920 --> 25:19.120
But like you keep reminding me, Mum,

25:19.120 --> 25:20.720
I didn't need you like Billy did.

25:20.720 --> 25:23.360
I didn't need that.
- What are you talking about?

25:23.360 --> 25:24.920
It wasn't like we all came back.

25:24.920 --> 25:28.800
There was, there was 12 of
us. We were a solid bunch.

25:28.800 --> 25:32.480
Six came back. Yeah.

25:32.480 --> 25:35.240
And then I did this job
and I was good at it.

25:35.240 --> 25:38.880
But did I make a difference?
Not really. Billy died.

25:38.880 --> 25:41.880
I mean, you must hate my guts.
I couldn't save your own son.

25:41.880 --> 25:45.280
Knot died, the closest thing
I had to family. John died.

25:45.280 --> 25:46.640
And I didn't even like John.

25:46.640 --> 25:47.600
I couldn't stand the guy,

25:47.600 --> 25:50.840
but I didn't wanna see him blown
up in front of my eyes, no.

25:50.840 --> 25:53.400
And then Thom.

25:55.720 --> 25:57.720
Thom died. Yeah.

26:00.080 --> 26:01.640
Do you know what I do day to day?

26:01.640 --> 26:03.920
No. Look, you never talk about it.

26:03.920 --> 26:06.800
You've never asked.
I'll tell you what I do.

26:06.800 --> 26:08.960
In fact, I'll tell you what I did today.

26:08.960 --> 26:10.920
Today I tried to diffuse a bomb

26:10.920 --> 26:12.520
that if it had have gone off,

26:12.520 --> 26:17.680
i-it'd have gone through every
bone and muscle in my body.

26:17.680 --> 26:20.960
You'd have been picking me
up off the floor bit by bit.

26:20.960 --> 26:23.960
The other day, there was a
woman chained to a radiator

26:23.960 --> 26:25.640
with a collar bomb.

26:25.640 --> 26:26.960
A collar bomb right around her neck.

26:26.960 --> 26:29.840
I have never seen somebody
so petrified in all my life.

26:29.840 --> 26:32.440
And do you know what
happened? I couldn't save her.

26:32.440 --> 26:35.600
Her head just blew off
right in front of my eyes.

26:35.600 --> 26:38.200
Imagine that. You haven't
got a fucking clue.

26:39.320 --> 26:42.680
Lana. Lana.

26:43.680 --> 26:46.880
You know Billy wasn't your fault.

26:46.880 --> 26:48.240
Thanks, Dad.

26:48.240 --> 26:49.160
Wasn't your fault.

26:49.160 --> 26:50.720
Thanks for telling me that now.

26:50.720 --> 26:52.400
That's really helpful. Yeah.

26:52.400 --> 26:54.800
Six months later, Billy wasn't my fault.

26:54.800 --> 26:57.480
Well, it's just typical
because you're a selfish git.

26:57.480 --> 26:59.960
Why don't you run off,
Dad, like you always do?

26:59.960 --> 27:01.000
He runs away, don't he, Mum?

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
Like you said, he runs
away and he hides. Yeah.

27:03.000 --> 27:04.520
Listen, you're no better.

27:04.520 --> 27:07.480
Get your shit together, 'cause
you're no use to anybody.

27:07.480 --> 27:09.120
That's a wicked thing to say.

27:09.120 --> 27:12.520
Okay, let's just take
a minute, all right?

27:12.520 --> 27:14.880
Calm down and we can talk properly.

27:14.880 --> 27:16.200
It's the truth, Dad.

27:16.200 --> 27:18.480
You been on me pecking
my head for how long.

27:18.480 --> 27:20.360
"Ring your mum, sort your mum out."

27:20.360 --> 27:21.360
You can't deal with it.

27:21.360 --> 27:23.880
Well, let me deal with it,
Mum. You're a pisshead.

27:23.880 --> 27:25.640
And I'm sorry that I wasn't the daughter

27:25.640 --> 27:28.160
that you wanted me to be and
Billy was your favourite.

27:28.160 --> 27:31.680
That's ridiculous. I wanted
both of you to be happy.

27:31.680 --> 27:35.160
Do I look happy? I can't
save the people that I love.

27:35.160 --> 27:37.520
I'm done. I have zero fucks to give.

27:43.320 --> 27:44.920
It wasn't clear initially,

27:44.920 --> 27:46.680
but when looked at differently,

27:46.680 --> 27:50.120
the attacks on King are
actually to his advantage.

27:50.120 --> 27:51.480
One of Webster's shell companies

27:51.480 --> 27:53.000
is among a number of businesses

27:53.000 --> 27:55.320
bidding for redevelopment of the site

27:55.320 --> 27:56.600
much like (indistinct) Power Station.

27:56.600 --> 27:58.760
Yeah, he's trying to
lower the asking price.

27:58.760 --> 28:00.960
We already know about Tritia Global.

28:00.960 --> 28:02.400
I-I actually had an
interesting conversation

28:02.400 --> 28:03.560
with the FCA earlier.

28:03.560 --> 28:06.720
Turns out Tritia was under investigation

28:06.720 --> 28:08.240
regarding improper data sharing.

28:08.240 --> 28:11.240
Right up until the bomb
destroyed all the vital records.

28:11.240 --> 28:13.160
Exactly.

28:13.160 --> 28:15.440
Hancock Seal and Pool Non-Profit

28:15.440 --> 28:18.080
is a holding company
of Webster's foundation

28:18.080 --> 28:22.640
of which recently deceased
minister Matthew Polfrey

28:22.640 --> 28:24.240
was a former business partner.

28:24.240 --> 28:27.640
Reports point to a recent
falling out between the two men.

28:28.480 --> 28:32.000
Also, local counsellors say
that far from being sentimental

28:32.000 --> 28:34.040
about his country estate,

28:34.040 --> 28:35.800
King has recently put in plans

28:35.800 --> 28:40.560
to build 2000 new homes on
the site within three years.

28:40.560 --> 28:43.840
One more thing. Lana's receipt.

28:45.080 --> 28:47.560
The fertiliser was purchased by a pig farm

28:47.560 --> 28:49.800
with little need for fertiliser.

28:49.800 --> 28:51.440
I'm sure it's a front.

28:51.440 --> 28:52.440
We're chasing confirmation,

28:52.440 --> 28:53.840
but I wouldn't be surprised

28:53.840 --> 28:55.920
if Webster King is the lease holder.

28:57.000 --> 29:00.400
King is the poster boy for
this new breed of billionaire.

29:00.400 --> 29:02.080
Running things in their favour,

29:02.080 --> 29:04.880
convincing governments to
look after their interests.

29:04.880 --> 29:08.320
Look, less than 24 hours
ago, King himself was targeted.

29:08.320 --> 29:10.280
If Lana hadn't driven
that Land Rover away,

29:10.280 --> 29:13.320
he woulda been killed along
with the rest of the guests.

29:13.320 --> 29:15.680
Sorry, your theory just doesn't add up.

29:15.680 --> 29:18.240
(tense music)

29:22.760 --> 29:24.320
(upbeat music)

29:24.320 --> 29:26.720
🎵 Life moves up and down 🎵

29:26.720 --> 29:29.640
🎵 You gotta figure it out 🎵

29:29.640 --> 29:32.520
🎵 Got no time for these fake guys 🎵

29:32.520 --> 29:35.640
(fist banging)

29:35.640 --> 29:38.200
🎵 Grinding for them pounds 🎵

29:38.200 --> 29:42.480
🎵 Hope it don't come crumbling down 🎵

29:42.480 --> 29:46.280
(cellphone ringing)

29:46.280 --> 29:49.360
- Danny.
- Lana, you all right?

29:49.360 --> 29:51.960
Yeah. Good thanks. What's up?

29:51.960 --> 29:53.560
Look, what's going on?

29:53.560 --> 29:54.640
You need to talk to me,

29:54.640 --> 29:57.360
because you just walked out
without saying anything.

29:57.360 --> 29:59.440
Yeah, I know. I'm sorry.

29:59.440 --> 30:02.480
What you said to Helen, that
was completely out of order.

30:05.120 --> 30:06.800
Yeah, I know.

30:06.800 --> 30:09.160
No, you're not the only
one that cared about Thom.

30:09.160 --> 30:11.240
All right?

30:12.360 --> 30:13.320
I know, Danny.

30:13.320 --> 30:16.120
It's just, Francis was
not listening to me.

30:16.960 --> 30:19.640
And, um, I know I
shouldn't let it get to me,

30:19.640 --> 30:22.000
but he's impossible for me to deal with.

30:22.000 --> 30:24.200
You just need to look in
the mirror for a second.

30:24.200 --> 30:26.520
You haven't been so easy
to deal with yourself.

30:27.760 --> 30:28.640
Yeah, I know, Danny.

30:28.640 --> 30:32.080
It's just, it's all starting
to, uh, get on top of me.

30:33.840 --> 30:37.400
With, um, Thom and Billy and Knot...

30:39.640 --> 30:42.320
But you've really been
stepping on some toes, mate.

30:42.320 --> 30:45.440
I know, you're right. You're always right.

30:45.440 --> 30:47.680
Okay, so what are you planning to do?

30:47.680 --> 30:49.280
Are you gonna come back or...

30:49.280 --> 30:50.520
Um, I don't think so.

30:50.520 --> 30:52.600
I probably burnt too many bridges there.

30:54.880 --> 30:57.160
How is it at HQ?
- Alex was right.

30:58.440 --> 31:01.640
Like you said, there was
someone behind it all.

31:01.640 --> 31:03.880
- Yeah.
- Webster King.

31:03.880 --> 31:05.480
They're saying he's the money.

31:05.480 --> 31:06.640
Right.

31:06.640 --> 31:08.560
But if that bomb had
gone off at his wedding,

31:08.560 --> 31:10.560
then he'd have been toasted.

31:10.560 --> 31:12.680
He wasn't in the room. Do you remember?

31:14.680 --> 31:16.760
[Danny] So here's the big
man giving his speech, yeah?

31:16.760 --> 31:19.960
Everybody telling jokes and
toasting to the happy couple.

31:20.800 --> 31:22.520
Now, everyone, you just enjoy yourself

31:22.520 --> 31:26.000
while our two families must
now endure the purgatory

31:26.000 --> 31:28.080
of wedding photos.

31:32.280 --> 31:36.440
The family being ushered out. There.

31:37.400 --> 31:39.560
See, Lana says this is
a false flag attack.

31:40.400 --> 31:43.760
Webster isn't the target. He's the money.

31:46.600 --> 31:48.480
Webster's wedding guests.

31:48.480 --> 31:51.240
Most of them could be
described as enemies.

31:51.240 --> 31:53.920
I mean, he made a joke about it himself.

31:53.920 --> 31:56.760
But he was using the
terror campaign as a cover

31:56.760 --> 31:59.080
for assassinating his business rivals.

32:02.280 --> 32:04.960
It's a move straight out of
the Russian oligarchs playbook.

32:04.960 --> 32:07.440
Yeah. They call it piranha capitalism.

32:07.440 --> 32:08.440
It's predatory appetite

32:08.440 --> 32:10.520
and score settling amongst super rich.

32:12.520 --> 32:16.400
Sir, the plane that landed at
Birdhill on the 8th of Feb,

32:16.400 --> 32:18.680
uh, Golf Bravo India Foxtrot Yankee,

32:18.680 --> 32:21.160
it's just been confirmed
it flew in from Cracow.

32:25.280 --> 32:27.000
Okay, surveillance are reporting

32:27.000 --> 32:29.400
that Webster King's just
been seen leaving his house

32:29.400 --> 32:31.600
with several items of luggage.

32:31.600 --> 32:33.480
He's moved his honeymoon up.

32:33.480 --> 32:36.040
The Challenger jet is
currently on the runway

32:36.040 --> 32:38.240
at Cobden Hill Airfield in Surrey.

32:39.840 --> 32:43.160
Pilot submitted a flight
plan about half an hour ago.

32:43.160 --> 32:47.480
It's due for takeoff later
today. Two passengers on board.

32:47.480 --> 32:49.560
- Destination?
- Kuwait.

32:50.920 --> 32:52.720
Weird place to have your honeymoon.

32:52.720 --> 32:55.680
Kuwait doesn't have an
extradition treaty with the UK.

32:55.680 --> 32:57.920
If he leaves now, we'll
never get him back.

33:01.000 --> 33:02.200
Sir.

33:02.200 --> 33:04.040
Okay, this is it.
We're past the threshold.

33:04.040 --> 33:06.600
I need to speak to the
commissioner first, but we're on.

33:06.600 --> 33:07.440
Let's go.

33:07.440 --> 33:10.040
(tense music)

33:28.160 --> 33:32.600
[Driver] I'll take your
bags on board for you, sir.

33:34.440 --> 33:37.440
(tyres screeching)

33:42.360 --> 33:44.720
Come to see me off, Commander?

33:44.720 --> 33:47.120
No need for you to come in person.

33:47.120 --> 33:49.440
Or have there been some developments?

33:49.440 --> 33:50.920
We need to talk to you
about your connection

33:50.920 --> 33:53.120
to the recent spate of terror attacks.

33:53.120 --> 33:54.040
If you have any questions,

33:54.040 --> 33:55.280
I'm happy to answer them in writing.

33:55.280 --> 33:56.440
But my wife is on route,

33:56.440 --> 33:58.560
and the minute she arrives,
that plane is taking off.

33:58.560 --> 34:00.719
Can't allow that, sir.

34:00.719 --> 34:02.960
I've been the subject
of a terror attack.

34:03.880 --> 34:05.960
For my safety and that of my wife,

34:05.960 --> 34:07.120
I wish to leave London

34:07.120 --> 34:09.199
for somewhere my security
can be guaranteed.

34:09.199 --> 34:11.400
I'm afraid this
aircraft's been grounded.

34:14.400 --> 34:15.200
[Webster] On whose authority?

34:15.200 --> 34:17.440
Air traffic control at my request.

34:17.440 --> 34:18.840
Then I'll have to
call the home secretary.

34:18.840 --> 34:20.360
As you know, she's a close friend.

34:20.360 --> 34:21.720
The home secretary herself

34:21.720 --> 34:24.240
felt this was the best way to proceed.

34:24.240 --> 34:27.280
We'll need you to accompany
us down to Counter Terror HQ,

34:27.280 --> 34:29.360
where we'll be conducting the interview.

34:34.080 --> 34:35.720
Now you're just being silly.

34:35.720 --> 34:36.680
DS Morgan.

34:36.680 --> 34:39.680
Webster King, I'm arresting
you under Section Five

34:39.680 --> 34:43.400
of the Terrorism Act 2006 for
committing acts of terrorism

34:43.400 --> 34:45.560
and assisting others to commit such acts.

34:45.560 --> 34:47.000
You do not have to say anything,

34:47.000 --> 34:48.160
but it may harm your defence

34:48.160 --> 34:49.640
if you do not mention when questioned

34:49.640 --> 34:51.560
something which you will
later rely on in court.

34:51.560 --> 34:54.640
Anything you do say may be
given in evidence. Cuffs.

34:54.640 --> 34:56.720
No. No. No need for that.

34:58.800 --> 35:03.480
Go on. Do it. Not so
confident all of a sudden.

35:03.480 --> 35:04.480
Just come with us.

35:04.480 --> 35:06.560
You're making a huge mistake.

35:07.240 --> 35:08.760
People like me don't go to prison.

35:08.760 --> 35:11.840
(cellphone ringing)

35:12.760 --> 35:14.760
It's my wife. She's on her way.

35:16.240 --> 35:18.240
Go on then.

35:19.200 --> 35:24.200
Hello, darling.
(explosion booms)

35:26.480 --> 35:29.240
(sirens blaring)

35:40.560 --> 35:45.560
I'm fine. Thank you.

35:48.960 --> 35:51.040
Looks like he was a target after all, sir.

35:53.960 --> 35:55.960
You all right, sir?

35:57.960 --> 35:59.920
He said it was his wife calling.

35:59.920 --> 36:02.600
Yeah. I don't think it was.

36:02.600 --> 36:05.640
No. No, of course

36:09.720 --> 36:11.440
They must've tampered with his phone.

36:11.440 --> 36:13.720
(cellphone ringing)

36:13.720 --> 36:14.760
I need to brief the commissioner.

36:14.760 --> 36:16.840
- Okay. Yes?
- [Investigator] Sir.

36:19.640 --> 36:21.640
Thanks.

36:27.520 --> 36:29.520
Okay, thank you. Bye.

36:31.080 --> 36:33.480
Sir. That was Batra.

36:33.480 --> 36:35.560
The terrorist just posted another video.

36:37.720 --> 36:39.800
[John] Hoist by his own petard.

36:39.800 --> 36:43.960
Yeah, so Webster King
thought that he was in charge,

36:43.960 --> 36:46.880
but it looks like the
bombers were just using him.

36:46.880 --> 36:48.880
And it seems like his usefulness expired.

36:48.880 --> 36:50.960
And now they're off the leash.

36:51.600 --> 36:53.000
We've lost our two key leads

36:53.000 --> 36:54.400
that coulda led us to the group,

36:54.400 --> 36:56.480
suspect B and now King.

36:57.760 --> 36:59.880
Well, what about Alex?

37:01.960 --> 37:03.800
See if he'll talk to us again.

37:03.800 --> 37:06.640
He's our primary lead now. We need him.

37:06.640 --> 37:08.720
[Helen] Okay.

37:09.760 --> 37:12.840
[Reporter] 24 hours after
a failed attempt on his life,

37:12.840 --> 37:15.800
billionaire banker Webster King is dead

37:15.800 --> 37:18.000
in what the Metropolitan
police are describing

37:18.000 --> 37:20.120
as a major terrorist incident.

37:20.120 --> 37:23.120
King reportedly died
in a targeted explosion

37:23.120 --> 37:26.160
at the hands of the gang known as the Wave

37:26.160 --> 37:27.640
who have claimed responsibility

37:27.640 --> 37:30.120
for a spate of bombings across the capital

37:30.120 --> 37:31.600
in the past weeks.

37:31.600 --> 37:33.000
As with previous attacks,

37:33.000 --> 37:35.120
the gang has released a photograph

37:35.120 --> 37:38.600
taunting both the victim's
family and the police.

37:38.600 --> 37:39.800
We would like to warn you

37:39.800 --> 37:41.960
as the following images are disturbing.

37:41.960 --> 37:44.880
(cellphone rings)

37:49.160 --> 37:51.160
- Alex.
- Lana.

37:51.720 --> 37:52.760
You all right?

37:52.760 --> 37:56.360
I've been given a bomb with instructions

37:56.360 --> 38:00.000
to hand deliver the device
to the London Stock Exchange.

38:00.000 --> 38:01.400
I'm certain they know I'm a mole

38:01.400 --> 38:03.240
and this bomb's meant for me.

38:03.240 --> 38:04.320
Right. Send me your location.

38:04.320 --> 38:06.760
I can get you a patrol car-
- No, don't!

38:06.760 --> 38:10.640
You to come. Alone. You promised.
Otherwise I'm a dead man.

38:10.640 --> 38:14.040
[Lana] I can't. Alex,
I'm not on SO-15 anymore.

38:14.040 --> 38:17.040
I don't care. You have to
help me. You said you would.

38:17.040 --> 38:18.360
No, I know, but I'm not authorised.

38:18.360 --> 38:19.400
I don't even have my kit.

38:19.400 --> 38:21.640
You're still expo, aren't you?

38:21.640 --> 38:24.960
Lana, I'm carrying a bomb and
it's your job to diffuse it.

38:25.920 --> 38:29.720
Right, um, can you find
a safe location nearby?

38:29.720 --> 38:31.800
Are you near any parks?

38:33.080 --> 38:35.280
I'm in the middle of the
city. Where am I supposed to go?

38:35.280 --> 38:40.360
Um, can you see any empty buildings?

38:40.920 --> 38:43.600
And just try and stay away
from as many people as you can.

38:43.600 --> 38:45.680
What if it detonates?

38:47.240 --> 38:50.760
I'll be framed as a cold hearted murderer.

38:52.560 --> 38:55.160
I'm fucked, aren't I?
- No, you're not. You're not.

38:57.160 --> 39:01.960
Just need to, uh, stay on
the phone to me. Stay calm.

39:03.880 --> 39:06.160
Keep looking around. You see anything?

39:08.080 --> 39:10.080
All right.

39:14.240 --> 39:15.800
I think I might've found somewhere.

39:15.800 --> 39:17.760
Sending you my location now.

39:17.760 --> 39:20.840
(suspenseful music)

39:22.360 --> 39:24.960
(door rattles)

39:38.680 --> 39:41.200
(door creaks)

39:51.800 --> 39:54.360
(Alex panting)

40:05.280 --> 40:08.680
(orange juice trickling)

40:13.120 --> 40:16.000
What's that look for?
It's just orange juice.

40:16.000 --> 40:17.520
- Never said a thing.
- [Val] Didn't have to.

40:17.520 --> 40:19.600
I know what you're thinking.

40:19.920 --> 40:23.800
Well, you're wrong. I was
thinking of going for a walk.

40:23.800 --> 40:26.600
Please don't pretend you're
gonna ask me to come with you.

40:26.600 --> 40:29.120
Sorry, how come you're so
sure I wasn't gonna ask you

40:29.120 --> 40:29.920
to come with me?

40:29.920 --> 40:32.040
'Cause you don't actually
want me to come with you.

40:32.040 --> 40:34.040
Yes, I do want you to come with me, Val.

40:34.040 --> 40:35.400
Well, you should've come out and told me

40:35.400 --> 40:37.480
in the first place then, shouldn't you?

40:38.440 --> 40:40.760
Oh, shot this. And
you're right actually.

40:40.760 --> 40:42.840
I don't want you to come with me.

41:07.120 --> 41:09.200
[Val] Always forgetting his bloody key.

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
(Val gasps)
Hello.

41:26.080 --> 41:28.640
[Alex] They killed him. Webster King.

41:28.640 --> 41:29.440
I know.

41:29.440 --> 41:31.880
All this time they
were only ever using him.

41:31.880 --> 41:33.840
The woman in charge

41:33.840 --> 41:36.080
is so much more dangerous
than he ever was.

41:36.080 --> 41:38.160
So they gonna stop now he's dead?

41:38.760 --> 41:40.560
Not a chance.

41:40.560 --> 41:42.240
She won't stop until she brings

41:42.240 --> 41:46.320
the entire criminal justice
system crashing down.

41:46.320 --> 41:49.880
Is that it? Yeah. You
need to get out of here.

41:49.880 --> 41:51.920
I've got this. Go on.

41:51.920 --> 41:54.000
How'd you do it?

41:55.520 --> 41:57.520
Day after day.

41:59.800 --> 42:03.280
Just get used to it. If
it's my time, it's my time.

42:05.040 --> 42:07.720
Go to safety. You're gonna
be fine. All right? Go on.

42:18.680 --> 42:21.680
(suspenseful music)

42:52.080 --> 42:55.920
(suspenseful music continues)

43:22.280 --> 43:26.080
(suspenseful music continues)

43:52.600 --> 43:55.320
(device beeping)

44:07.160 --> 44:09.800
(shots booming)

44:27.640 --> 44:30.160
(door creaks)

44:34.880 --> 44:37.880
(suspenseful music)

44:42.320 --> 44:45.160
(taser crackling)

44:50.040 --> 44:52.520
(tense music)

44:54.280 --> 44:57.280
(suspenseful music)
