WEBVTT

00:01.700 --> 00:02.860
<i>Previously on Tyrant...</i>

00:02.895 --> 00:04.660
I need an
hour with Sheik Rashid.

00:04.670 --> 00:06.100
So, you want to use

00:06.135 --> 00:09.540
Sheik Rashid to do an
end run around Ihab?

00:09.575 --> 00:11.270
Does your brother even
know you're here?

00:11.305 --> 00:12.870
Do it!

00:12.905 --> 00:16.040
You understand our precautions?

00:16.075 --> 00:18.280
Yesterday you were my enemy.

00:18.315 --> 00:23.180
But today you are my guest.

00:23.190 --> 00:26.050
He is meeting Ihab
Rashid on my orders.

00:26.085 --> 00:27.450
Bassam's been nowhere

00:27.460 --> 00:29.360
near Ihab in the last 24 hours.

00:29.395 --> 00:32.130
That is wrong.

00:32.165 --> 00:35.560
We could try
again, that's all.

00:35.595 --> 00:38.570
We try and I
fail... I will feel worse.

00:38.605 --> 00:40.400
Change the subject.

00:40.435 --> 00:46.370
I trusted you; you are my
blood and you betrayed me.

00:46.405 --> 00:49.740
Uh... you need
to see something.

00:49.775 --> 00:51.410
I demand to sit

00:51.445 --> 00:55.580
down with President
Jamal Al Fayeed!

00:55.615 --> 00:57.720
He demands?

00:57.755 --> 00:58.990
Jamal.

00:59.025 --> 01:02.420
You can end this...
without firing a shot.

01:02.455 --> 01:03.520
This is what you wanted.

01:05.265 --> 01:08.560
Is it?

01:08.595 --> 01:10.660
General, tell your
men to stand down.

01:10.670 --> 01:12.500
But, Mr. President?

01:15.190 --> 01:21.410
You lied to me.

01:21.445 --> 01:24.580
Failed to inform you
of my every move, yes.

01:24.615 --> 01:27.050
No, you didn't fail to

01:27.085 --> 01:34.090
inform, you lied, and right now
you are lying again to me.

01:34.125 --> 01:36.120
For God's sake,
I'm your brother.

01:36.155 --> 01:37.590
Your blood.

01:37.625 --> 01:39.460
Jamal, can't we just
talk about the result?

01:39.495 --> 01:42.100
It's the result that
ultimately matters.

01:42.135 --> 01:43.960
Why do you want to
talk about the result?

01:44.770 --> 01:47.430
The result sickens me.

01:47.440 --> 01:49.770
You were supposed to offer one

01:49.805 --> 01:52.440
tribal monkey the opportunity to

01:52.475 --> 01:55.310
talk to me, and instead tribal

01:55.345 --> 02:01.650
<i>monkey's father demands
 to talk to me.</i>

02:08.919 --> 02:11.990
I'm not a fool.

02:12.025 --> 02:17.660
But you are making
me look like a fool.

02:17.670 --> 02:19.830
You won't look like a fool.

02:19.980 --> 02:21.620
Yes, it...
it would have been nice

02:21.655 --> 02:22.820
if things had
happened the way

02:22.855 --> 02:25.760
we wanted, but the
net-net is the same.

02:25.795 --> 02:28.790
The president of Abbudin is
sitting down with the legendary

02:28.825 --> 02:31.130
patriarch of the opposition.

02:31.165 --> 02:33.230
Do you have any
how huge that is?

02:33.265 --> 02:34.800
How great that is?

02:34.835 --> 02:36.500
Yeah, for him.

02:36.550 --> 02:39.020
Meanwhile, in
the country of Abbudin...

02:39.055 --> 02:42.020
citizens continue to overrun
Founder's Plaza with calls for

02:42.055 --> 02:43.690
everything from students' rights

02:43.725 --> 02:46.430
to the complete overthrow of
the ruling Al Fayeed family.

02:47.030 --> 02:48.000
The elderly Sheik

02:48.035 --> 02:50.260
continues to attract
enormous crowds.

02:50.270 --> 02:53.700
Today's estimates placed the
number at upwards of 15,000.

02:53.735 --> 02:58.440
Up significantly from
yesterday's 12,000.

02:58.840 --> 02:59.940
This makes no sense.

02:59.975 --> 03:02.610
We have a wonderfully
elegant way out of this.

03:02.645 --> 03:04.710
Yes.

03:04.745 --> 03:08.110
We simply bend over and try not

03:08.120 --> 03:10.850
to think about
what is happening.

03:11.050 --> 03:13.490
You just offered the
sheik the same package you

03:13.525 --> 03:16.160
offered Ihab three days ago.

03:16.195 --> 03:20.660
Jamal, these are
your deal points.

03:20.695 --> 03:23.330
Why doesn't it rain?

03:23.365 --> 03:27.830
Anything, something to drive
the people out of the Plaza.

03:27.840 --> 03:28.900
Hey, you know what?

03:28.935 --> 03:30.840
I'm gonna call Tariq.

03:30.875 --> 03:33.510
They have a mole in the Rashid
camp; maybe they can tell us

03:33.545 --> 03:35.170
what it is he's looking for.

03:35.180 --> 03:38.040
Yes, it's a good idea.

03:38.050 --> 03:41.210
Tariq only wants to be of help.

03:41.220 --> 03:43.120
He's a big fan of the sheik.

03:43.155 --> 03:45.790
Yeah.

03:45.825 --> 03:47.390
Yeah, you're right.

03:47.425 --> 03:48.320
Well, what about Ziad?

03:48.420 --> 03:50.460
Maybe if he got some
presidential love, he'd be

03:50.495 --> 03:52.460
willing to play ball.

03:52.495 --> 03:55.430
My point is, I'm gonna try and
have all of the deal points

03:55.465 --> 03:58.300
locked down before you even
walk into the room, okay?

03:58.335 --> 04:00.200
So, just, just sit with him;

04:00.235 --> 04:01.270
that's all you have to do.

04:01.305 --> 04:02.640
In return, he'll tell everyone

04:02.675 --> 04:04.100
in the Plaza to go home, that

04:04.110 --> 04:05.300
they're part of the process now.

04:05.310 --> 04:07.710
And do you know who's
gonna get the credit?

04:07.745 --> 04:09.280
You will, President Jamal Al

04:09.315 --> 04:10.810
Fayeed, for being willing to sit

04:10.845 --> 04:15.300
down with him and for
being willing to listen.

04:15.350 --> 04:20.550
Bargaining with sheep herders.

04:20.560 --> 04:24.120
Look... I know
it's hard, but sometimes

04:24.130 --> 04:25.060
you have to give something to

04:25.095 --> 04:28.730
get something, and I think
what we get is huge.

04:28.765 --> 04:32.330
Please, just... just
sit with the man.

04:34.640 --> 04:37.040
It'll be you, me and Yussef.

04:37.075 --> 04:39.740
We'll do it in the council
chambers and I've told them they

04:39.775 --> 04:44.740
can bring two delegates
if they want to.

04:47.515 --> 04:53.490
And... what if I don't
like what he has to say?

04:53.525 --> 04:54.550
It's not an issue.

04:54.560 --> 04:56.160
If he asks for anything that

04:56.195 --> 04:57.420
you're not prepared to give, you

04:57.430 --> 05:01.830
just say, "Let me take
that under advisement."

05:01.865 --> 05:03.430
Nice one.

05:03.465 --> 05:09.270
Let me... Let me take
that under advisement.

05:09.305 --> 05:17.910
Let me... Let me... Let me
take that under advisement.

05:21.980 --> 05:25.090
If someone would have
told me that the first visitor

05:25.125 --> 05:26.650
I'd be receiving in my capacity

05:26.685 --> 05:28.250
as first lady would be the sworn

05:28.260 --> 05:32.520
enemy of your father, I would
have roared with laughter.

05:34.995 --> 05:38.130
The sheik is
going to clear the Plaza.

05:38.165 --> 05:41.100
<i> He is going
to clear the Plaza?</i>

05:41.135 --> 05:44.300
It's not his plaza,
it's not his country.

05:44.310 --> 05:47.810
Why are you so
frightened of him?

05:47.845 --> 05:49.310
Frightened?

05:49.345 --> 05:55.550
Do I look like a
frightened person?

05:55.585 --> 05:58.450
You are naive.

05:58.485 --> 06:00.790
You have some
idea in your mind,

06:00.825 --> 06:03.320
that all a person
has to do is

06:03.355 --> 06:05.460
mow down
his enemies, that that

06:05.495 --> 06:10.160
is all there is to
being a leader.

06:10.195 --> 06:13.000
Call your cousin in Egypt.

06:13.035 --> 06:17.070
It's not so simple anymore.

06:17.105 --> 06:22.010
Everybody has a camera,
everybody's on YouTube.

06:22.045 --> 06:28.180
You just be sure...
You just be sure...

06:28.215 --> 06:33.250
that you smile when he
walks through the door.

06:38.930 --> 06:40.260
You are welcome.

06:42.695 --> 06:46.100
I'm proud of you, by the way.

06:46.135 --> 06:49.470
Proud of a grown doctor
who can't tie his own tie?

06:49.505 --> 06:51.640
Proud of you
for getting people who thought

06:51.675 --> 06:52.810
they'd never be in the same

06:52.845 --> 06:55.310
country together, much
less the same room...

06:55.345 --> 06:57.540
to talk about how they
can move forward.

06:57.750 --> 06:59.140
Well, tell me that at

06:59.150 --> 07:02.080
the end of the day when
it's actually happened.

07:02.115 --> 07:03.070
I keep feeling we're about an

07:03.105 --> 07:05.740
inch from this whole thing
falling apart.

07:15.795 --> 07:19.570
Are you
certain you can do this?

07:19.605 --> 07:24.600
Everything that's happening
here is ultimately for you.

07:24.610 --> 07:26.610
For your brothers.

07:26.645 --> 07:29.580
For your children.

07:29.615 --> 07:33.810
I'm an old man, I am not
long for this world.

07:33.820 --> 07:37.820
I only ask you show the
president the same respect he's

07:37.855 --> 07:41.420
showing us by inviting us here.

07:41.455 --> 07:43.290
He didn't invite us.

07:43.325 --> 07:48.130
You demanded an audience,
shamed him into it.

07:48.165 --> 07:51.300
I took the same
invitation he offered you

07:51.335 --> 07:54.500
and turned it into a demand.

07:54.535 --> 07:56.970
The point is, we are now facing

07:57.005 --> 08:01.260
our enemy across a table
instead of a battlefield.

08:01.295 --> 08:05.460
And the world thinks
it was our doing.

08:05.495 --> 08:09.330
Now we must present
ourselves accordingly.

08:09.365 --> 08:13.200
As statesmen, as
civilized human beings.

08:13.235 --> 08:19.010
No bombast, no fire, just an
eagerness to get things done.

08:19.045 --> 08:21.510
Can you help me?

08:47.210 --> 08:48.800
Sheik.

08:48.810 --> 08:51.710
Come.

09:04.990 --> 09:05.990
Walid.

09:06.025 --> 09:07.520
Yes, my brother.

09:07.530 --> 09:11.360
I know you
wanted to accompany me here

09:11.395 --> 09:13.260
today and now you have.

09:13.295 --> 09:16.830
The pictures have been taken.

09:16.865 --> 09:20.100
Now get back in the
car and go home.

09:20.135 --> 09:22.740
E... Excuse me?

09:22.775 --> 09:27.440
I came here to assist you...
in these negotiations.

09:27.450 --> 09:29.780
I've been working with

09:29.815 --> 09:32.580
the Al Fayeeds for
over a decade now.

09:32.615 --> 09:34.540
I know how they think.

09:34.575 --> 09:37.870
You've made
yourself a friend to the very

09:37.905 --> 09:43.780
people who drove
me from my home.

09:43.815 --> 09:47.280
Get back to the car and leave.

10:20.820 --> 10:22.610
Salaam alaikum.

10:22.645 --> 10:23.550
Salaam alaikum.

10:23.585 --> 10:25.450
<i> Wa alaikum as-salaam.</i>

10:25.485 --> 10:26.990
Sheik Rashid.

10:27.025 --> 10:30.360
- Bassam.
- My wife Molly.

10:30.395 --> 10:31.360
Hi.

10:31.395 --> 10:34.330
- How are you?
- Good

10:36.430 --> 10:38.530
Welcome.

10:40.600 --> 10:42.770
Sheik.

10:42.805 --> 10:45.100
Salaam alaikum.

11:02.520 --> 11:04.190
All set?

11:04.225 --> 11:07.550
I just heard Ihab is here.

11:07.585 --> 11:08.680
Yeah, he's
part of the delegation.

11:08.830 --> 11:10.760
Apparently, it all happened
at the last minute.

11:10.770 --> 11:12.330
Here's hoping nothing

11:12.365 --> 11:14.030
else happens at the last minute.

11:14.190 --> 11:19.420
Tell me, Ziad is sure about
these bargaining points?

11:19.455 --> 11:21.830
Well, I asked
him about 100 times.

11:21.865 --> 11:26.630
That Ihab so much as
looks at me cross-eyed and I'll

11:26.665 --> 11:29.200
throw him back in the prison.

11:29.235 --> 11:31.370
What about the sheik?

11:31.405 --> 11:33.840
He can't help but look
at you cross-eyed.

11:38.015 --> 11:39.610
Mr. President.

11:43.210 --> 11:45.450
Welcome, sir.

12:00.030 --> 12:02.530
Mr. President.

12:08.810 --> 12:11.270
Sheik Rashid.

12:13.110 --> 12:15.610
Please.

12:29.660 --> 12:31.890
Excuse me, have you a toilet?

12:31.900 --> 12:33.400
His mouth's full of phlegm.

12:33.435 --> 12:36.470
Yeah, of course.

12:57.550 --> 13:02.690
Well, gentlemen, this is a meeting

13:02.725 --> 13:07.360
decades in the making.

13:07.370 --> 13:09.570
Where should we start?

13:09.605 --> 13:11.030
Taxation?

13:11.040 --> 13:14.070
Representation on the council?

13:14.105 --> 13:20.510
Perhaps it's even time to
rethink the nationalization of

13:20.545 --> 13:24.580
some of Ma'an's
natural resources.

13:24.615 --> 13:28.720
You are
very generous, President.

13:28.755 --> 13:30.350
And very astute.

13:31.400 --> 13:33.810
I know you very much want the

13:33.845 --> 13:36.440
Founder's Plaza
returned to normal.

13:36.475 --> 13:39.010
People back in their homes.

13:39.045 --> 13:42.280
Businesses able to
receive customers.

13:42.315 --> 13:48.290
I believe I can make
all that happen.

13:48.325 --> 13:54.890
There is really just one
thing I want in return.

13:54.900 --> 13:58.630
Tell me
what is on your mind.

13:58.665 --> 14:03.500
I would like to
ask, now that your father has

14:03.535 --> 14:07.410
passed, that you allow there to

14:07.445 --> 14:10.980
be open and free elections for
the office of president of

14:11.015 --> 14:14.480
Abbudin, monitored by the U.N.,

14:14.515 --> 14:17.880
open to any candidate, no matter

14:17.915 --> 14:23.250
their political or
religious affiliation.

14:39.370 --> 14:44.180
Let me take that...
under advisement.

14:45.150 --> 14:48.370
Very well.

14:48.405 --> 14:49.600
Sheik Rashid, can we

14:49.635 --> 14:54.750
now rely upon you to clear
the Founder's Plaza?

14:56.260 --> 15:02.430
Let me take that...
under advisement.

15:17.045 --> 15:20.210
Nothing to fear... just gravity.

16:42.160 --> 16:46.960
<b>Tyrant S01E06
"What the World Needs Now"</b>

16:46.995 --> 16:56.860
<i>Sync and corrected by
Gianluca Belfiglio</i>

17:02.650 --> 17:04.950
He wants elections!

17:05.050 --> 17:07.290
Is he out of his mind?

17:07.325 --> 17:11.660
I'm not begging the people
for my right to lead them.

17:11.694 --> 17:14.630
These talks were
a horrible idea.

17:14.665 --> 17:16.660
The talks were
not a horrible idea.

17:16.694 --> 17:21.599
- Yes, he outmaneuvered us...
- Yes, I would say so.

17:23.575 --> 17:28.040
So, what do we do,
Mr. Advisor?

17:28.075 --> 17:30.780
What do we do, brother?

17:30.815 --> 17:34.680
It turns out he wants to
be George Washington.

17:39.920 --> 17:43.420
Typically with a crowd
of this size, I believe the

17:43.455 --> 17:46.290
estimate for today
is almost 20,000.

17:46.325 --> 17:48.930
The people will see your heavy

17:48.965 --> 17:51.800
armor approaching, your tanks,

17:51.835 --> 17:55.270
and almost immediately you
will lose 2,000 or 3,000.

17:55.305 --> 17:57.200
But in this particular instance,

17:57.235 --> 17:58.800
since we've
been visible to the

17:58.810 --> 18:00.070
crowd for
several days without

18:00.105 --> 18:02.780
an order to proceed,
we may not

18:02.815 --> 18:05.480
see quite so many
flee initially.

18:05.515 --> 18:07.210
But once we initiate use of the

18:07.245 --> 18:11.480
water cannons, the crowd
will diminish by half.

18:11.490 --> 18:14.420
It's that remaining 10,000.

18:14.455 --> 18:19.560
The semi hard-core... That becomes
a challenge to disperse.

18:19.595 --> 18:21.230
We'll begin with the rubber

18:21.265 --> 18:25.600
bullets, then conventional ammo.

18:25.635 --> 18:28.930
All the while, the tanks...

18:28.940 --> 18:32.440
are moving, converging
on a center point.

18:32.475 --> 18:37.940
And, obviously, anyone
in their path...

18:37.950 --> 18:40.680
The whole thing will
take about 45 minutes.

18:40.715 --> 18:43.580
Although that's not
counting the cleanup.

18:43.615 --> 18:44.680
You're going to need at least a

18:44.690 --> 18:46.290
day of scrubbing before that

18:46.325 --> 18:52.360
plaza is once again presentable
to the civilian population.

18:52.395 --> 18:55.960
What kind of
injuries can we expect?

18:55.995 --> 18:58.500
My guesstimate?

18:58.535 --> 19:00.430
2,000 injured.

19:00.465 --> 19:03.440
Perhaps 200 fatalities.

19:04.405 --> 19:05.840
Of course, every day you wait,

19:05.875 --> 19:09.940
every minute you wait,
those numbers rise.

19:15.180 --> 19:16.880
Any of the great minds

19:16.915 --> 19:21.690
here have any options to offer?

19:21.725 --> 19:23.990
Or is this it?

19:24.025 --> 19:30.460
We kill 200 today, then go to
war with our people tomorrow.

19:30.495 --> 19:31.900
Not to make light of

19:31.935 --> 19:36.900
it, but, uh... we're quite
good at going to war.

19:36.935 --> 19:42.510
I have every confidence
we will prevail.

19:42.545 --> 19:46.150
I need an
hour to reflect.

20:14.820 --> 20:16.190
Free and open

20:16.225 --> 20:19.060
elections. Exactly
what the sheik said.

20:19.095 --> 20:20.560
No, think about it, it gives you

20:20.595 --> 20:21.700
everything you want, everything

20:21.735 --> 20:23.730
you could possibly hope for.

20:23.765 --> 20:25.900
Um, what does it give me?

20:25.935 --> 20:26.970
Options.

20:27.005 --> 20:28.870
And all of them are good.

20:28.905 --> 20:31.970
The first thing it gives you
is, the Plaza will be empty.

20:31.980 --> 20:33.210
What can the people possibly

20:33.245 --> 20:37.750
protest about when the choice
of who leads them is theirs?

20:37.785 --> 20:44.090
Mm, but then... I have
to run to regain leadership.

20:44.125 --> 20:45.420
Okay.

20:45.455 --> 20:47.690
And what's the worst
that can happen?

20:48.725 --> 20:52.330
Bassam... I lose.

20:52.365 --> 20:55.200
Uh... Everything our father

20:55.235 --> 20:58.370
built, everything we achieved...

20:58.405 --> 21:02.540
everything we are ceases to be.

21:02.575 --> 21:04.770
I get that. I do.

21:04.780 --> 21:07.240
But look,
the days when a single

21:07.275 --> 21:09.080
family can
continue to rule by

21:09.115 --> 21:10.510
sheer force of will are pretty

21:10.545 --> 21:13.380
much over, with or
without elections.

21:13.415 --> 21:17.190
So if you lose... You lose.

21:17.225 --> 21:18.620
And you wake up
the next day and

21:18.655 --> 21:21.020
you start living the rest of
your life, except no one's

21:21.030 --> 21:22.690
hanging you, no one's shoving a

21:22.725 --> 21:23.790
bayonet up your ass, the crowd

21:23.825 --> 21:26.960
isn't calling for your
head... You just go away.

21:26.995 --> 21:30.070
You know, you move your money to
Switzerland, or wherever guys

21:30.105 --> 21:31.200
like you move your money, you

21:31.235 --> 21:32.500
buy your own goddamn island, and

21:32.535 --> 21:34.840
you're still one of the
richest men in the world.

21:34.875 --> 21:36.970
But here's the thing.

21:37.005 --> 21:40.640
I don't think you're gonna lose.

21:40.675 --> 21:41.840
I won't?

21:41.850 --> 21:42.840
No.

21:42.850 --> 21:46.980
These elections are a year,
a year and a half away.

21:47.015 --> 21:48.150
First you got to change the

21:48.185 --> 21:49.250
constitution... that's gonna take

21:49.285 --> 21:50.420
some time...
and then comes the

21:50.455 --> 21:51.820
campaign... that's a year, a year

21:51.855 --> 21:53.420
and a half...
and in that time,

21:53.455 --> 21:54.820
the people are getting to know

21:54.830 --> 21:58.490
you, and when they get to know
you, they're gonna love you.

21:58.500 --> 22:00.160
And while they're busy falling

22:00.195 --> 22:01.000
in love with you, you're gonna

22:01.035 --> 22:02.100
do what powerful
people do.

22:02.135 --> 22:05.900
You build 20 schools, ten
hospitals, a bunch of parks.

22:05.935 --> 22:08.170
And what's the
sheik gonna build?

22:08.205 --> 22:13.280
Well... he's
not going to build shit.

22:13.315 --> 22:17.210
No, he's just gonna
cough and spit and... look at

22:17.245 --> 22:18.750
people with that milky eye.

22:21.985 --> 22:28.190
So... we are
going to win this?

22:30.230 --> 22:32.860
I think we can.

22:58.120 --> 23:00.660
Wake up.

23:00.695 --> 23:02.890
Look who's back.

23:05.930 --> 23:09.060
I'm pleased for you both.

23:09.070 --> 23:12.900
Here's hoping the two of you
will be very happy together.

23:16.810 --> 23:19.170
What's wrong with you?

23:19.180 --> 23:21.840
<i>What's wrong with you?</i>

23:21.850 --> 23:24.780
Bargaining away our lives.

23:24.815 --> 23:28.080
Not to mention your
child's birthright.

23:28.090 --> 23:33.260
I can't believe you
are still mad about this.

23:33.295 --> 23:37.360
Three weeks and you are
still mad about it.

23:37.395 --> 23:40.660
Don't you watch television?

23:40.695 --> 23:46.000
They are calling me "a beacon
of hope in the Middle East."

23:46.035 --> 23:49.170
Good for them.

23:49.205 --> 23:50.310
Maybe you can call them and have

23:50.345 --> 23:52.610
them play with your new friend.

23:52.645 --> 23:55.110
I'm not interested.

24:10.390 --> 24:12.230
Good morning, Yussef.

24:12.265 --> 24:16.230
What can I do for you?

24:16.265 --> 24:20.240
<i>What? 60 Minutes?</i>

24:20.275 --> 24:26.640
What is... You mean
the television show?

24:26.675 --> 24:30.080
They want to do a
piece about me?

24:30.115 --> 24:31.150
Spending a day

24:31.185 --> 24:33.480
with the sheik is like
trailing a rock star.

24:34.480 --> 24:35.980
Wherever he goes, he is besieged

24:35.990 --> 24:37.820
with requests for
pictures and autographs.

24:37.855 --> 24:38.690
Jamal?

24:38.725 --> 24:41.220
- And he never hesitate to stop...
- Huh?

24:41.255 --> 24:43.290
- ...to engage conversation with...
- The, uh, council's waiting.

24:46.200 --> 24:47.530
It's a wonderful thing to want

24:47.565 --> 24:50.230
to build schools,
and hospitals, and parks.

24:50.570 --> 24:52.570
I don't think that's the Office

24:52.605 --> 24:55.010
of Budget Management's issue.

24:55.045 --> 24:58.510
Then... what is their issue?

24:58.545 --> 24:59.680
I'm the president.

24:59.715 --> 25:01.080
I... I want this money.

25:01.115 --> 25:02.110
I need this money.

25:02.310 --> 25:04.950
The way
we would normally fund these

25:04.985 --> 25:06.950
sorts of projects would be to

25:06.985 --> 25:08.880
sell bonds on the world market.

25:08.890 --> 25:10.390
And I don't think under normal

25:10.425 --> 25:13.960
circumstances that
would be a problem.

25:13.995 --> 25:14.960
Explain.

25:14.995 --> 25:18.230
It's just...
ever since you

25:18.265 --> 25:20.700
- announce elections...
- What about the elections?

25:20.735 --> 25:23.000
There's
concern that the debt holder

25:23.035 --> 25:26.700
might change, and might not
be interested in honoring the

25:26.735 --> 25:29.300
obligations these
bonds represent.

25:29.310 --> 25:30.540
No, no, no, no, no.

25:30.575 --> 25:32.340
The debt holder is not going to

25:32.375 --> 25:34.540
change... That's the whole point.

25:34.550 --> 25:39.720
Now, we want the people
to vote for me...

25:39.755 --> 25:43.950
so we need money
to build things.

25:43.985 --> 25:47.690
Why?

25:47.725 --> 25:51.030
<i>You are the president.</i>

25:51.065 --> 25:53.960
The constitution does not
call for these elections.

25:53.995 --> 25:56.030
<i>There's no need for
these elections.</i>

25:56.065 --> 25:58.570
We gain nothing from these
elections, and in fact may have

25:58.605 --> 26:02.040
created for ourselves the
mechanism of our own demise.

26:02.075 --> 26:03.040
Call them off.

26:03.075 --> 26:05.040
And what
about the people?

26:05.075 --> 26:06.040
We've already told them.

26:06.075 --> 26:08.040
I'll deal
with the people.

26:08.050 --> 26:10.380
I always have.

26:10.415 --> 26:13.580
Mr. President, please.

26:13.615 --> 26:17.890
Embrace who you are
and what is yours.

26:17.925 --> 26:21.490
Let's put an end to
this foolishness.

26:25.090 --> 26:27.560
"60 Minutes" called.

26:27.595 --> 26:29.560
Pardon me?

26:29.570 --> 26:32.600
Didn't Yussef tell you?

26:32.635 --> 26:35.100
<i>"60 Minutes" called.</i>

26:35.110 --> 26:39.110
They want to do a
piece about me.

26:39.145 --> 26:43.410
Have they ever wanted to
do a piece about you?

26:43.445 --> 26:47.550
How about you?

26:47.585 --> 26:48.780
Well...

26:48.790 --> 26:50.750
I've been called... to an

26:50.785 --> 26:55.290
emergency meeting with a
delegation from Norway.

26:55.325 --> 26:59.960
When I return, I want to hear
that these new construction

26:59.995 --> 27:03.970
projects have been financed.

27:04.005 --> 27:08.510
I also want to hear how excited
the military is about the

27:08.545 --> 27:14.140
prospects for free
elections in Abbudin.

27:14.175 --> 27:17.110
Thank you, gentlemen.

27:17.145 --> 27:19.310
This meeting is adjourned.

27:30.090 --> 27:33.400
Uh, Ziad.

27:33.435 --> 27:38.230
The Norwegian president has
asked me to meet him alone.

27:38.240 --> 27:42.440
Something about a
pipeline situation.

27:42.475 --> 27:44.510
No one even knows he's here, so

27:44.545 --> 27:48.080
I'll text you as soon as
I am safely in the room.

28:19.940 --> 28:22.950
No hello?

28:22.985 --> 28:25.010
No "it's been a long time"?

28:28.180 --> 28:31.420
No "I missed you"?

28:31.455 --> 28:32.790
Hello.

28:34.325 --> 28:38.130
It's been a long time.

28:38.165 --> 28:42.430
And as you can see,
I've missed you.

28:52.940 --> 28:56.650
You need to
come see me more often.

28:56.685 --> 29:00.080
That was like an explosion.

29:00.115 --> 29:05.320
A presidential explosion?

29:05.355 --> 29:08.720
A presidential eruption.

29:14.660 --> 29:17.670
Can I ask you something?

29:17.705 --> 29:20.970
Mm.

29:21.005 --> 29:25.410
Do you think
the people love me?

29:30.980 --> 29:35.350
Well, the
people don't know you.

29:35.385 --> 29:41.360
But if they did, I am sure
that they would love you.

29:41.395 --> 29:44.590
How could
anyone not love you?

30:00.740 --> 30:02.840
May I?

30:14.620 --> 30:18.290
I know we, uh, we don't see
eye to eye on a few things.

30:18.800 --> 30:20.060
The elections, the sheik.

30:20.095 --> 30:21.010
If you've come here to

30:21.045 --> 30:22.910
tell me what to say or to drill

30:22.920 --> 30:25.150
me the way you've been drilling

30:25.185 --> 30:30.460
my husband and the others...
let me remind you:

30:30.495 --> 30:33.960
I've been in the public
eye since I was 18.

30:33.995 --> 30:37.500
I know what to say when
the cameras are on.

30:37.535 --> 30:41.430
And I know what to do
when the cameras are off.

30:41.465 --> 30:43.500
Of course you do.

30:45.470 --> 30:48.610
What?

30:49.460 --> 30:52.030
You.

30:52.065 --> 30:54.130
You're so...

30:59.240 --> 31:01.900
impressed with yourself.

31:01.910 --> 31:03.840
"Look at me.

31:03.875 --> 31:05.910
Look at what I did.

31:05.945 --> 31:10.210
I'm bringing democracy
to Abbudin."

31:10.245 --> 31:12.910
You really believe
he can do this?

31:12.920 --> 31:17.050
Win the votes and the
love of the people?

31:17.085 --> 31:19.250
Yes.

31:19.260 --> 31:20.720
Yes, I do.

31:20.755 --> 31:24.330
I guess it helps to be
away from him for 20 years.

31:29.160 --> 31:32.430
Forgive the intrusion.

31:32.440 --> 31:37.910
You cannot
outrun history.

31:37.945 --> 31:44.280
One would be a fool to stick
one's head in the sand and not

31:44.315 --> 31:49.220
see how change is
sweeping the Middle East.

31:49.255 --> 31:53.190
Change... and cell phones.

31:53.225 --> 31:55.860
Everyone has a voice, everyone

31:55.895 --> 32:00.700
has an opinion, and
everyone has a camera.

32:00.735 --> 32:04.230
It simply stands to reason then,

32:04.265 --> 32:06.530
that everyone would expect to

32:06.540 --> 32:11.040
have a say about how
they are governed.

32:11.075 --> 32:12.410
Well, he's my son, so

32:12.445 --> 32:15.880
of course I think he's special.

32:15.915 --> 32:19.980
And he's always seen things
differently than his father,

32:20.015 --> 32:21.550
so I'm not entirely surprised

32:21.585 --> 32:24.590
that he's turning
everything on its head.

32:24.625 --> 32:27.890
Trying things that have
never been tried before.

32:27.925 --> 32:29.890
But the main thing is that I

32:29.925 --> 32:33.230
think he wants what's
best for the country.

32:33.265 --> 32:36.000
Even if it's not him.

32:36.035 --> 32:37.500
And I think that gives you a

32:37.535 --> 32:41.040
hint at just how special he is.

32:41.075 --> 32:44.940
I don't say these things for effect.

32:44.975 --> 32:50.080
I say them because...
this is the reality.

32:50.115 --> 32:53.610
This is how I truly
feel about it.

32:53.620 --> 32:56.620
We are coming to this place
one way or the other.

32:56.655 --> 33:02.590
We can either be in front
of it or behind it.

33:02.625 --> 33:04.530
Just look at me.

33:04.565 --> 33:07.300
Here we go.

33:07.335 --> 33:09.930
You served
for three decades as

33:09.965 --> 33:13.670
the head of the military for
an ironfisted dictator.

33:13.705 --> 33:16.040
Now here comes
the son, and he's

33:16.075 --> 33:18.810
freeing political prisoners,
sitting down with opposition

33:18.845 --> 33:21.640
leaders, calling for elections.

33:21.675 --> 33:23.440
Isn't your head spinning?

33:26.320 --> 33:28.650
Yes and no.

33:28.685 --> 33:31.150
My nephew is a visionary.

33:31.185 --> 33:35.660
But he is also very much
like his father, my brother.

33:35.695 --> 33:39.190
My brother looked at the vast
desert, the warring tribes,

33:39.200 --> 33:42.030
the hostile outside forces
conspiring against him

33:42.065 --> 33:46.570
and nonetheless felt that he
could build a nation.

33:46.605 --> 33:48.700
Insane.

33:48.710 --> 33:50.740
And yet here we are.

33:50.775 --> 33:52.470
A nation.

33:52.480 --> 33:56.740
With abundant schools and
hospitals and a vibrant economy.

33:56.750 --> 33:59.680
And now my nephew says,
what if we have elections?

33:59.715 --> 34:01.680
What if we let the
people choose?

34:01.715 --> 34:04.220
You think they might choose me?

34:04.255 --> 34:08.860
An old dog like me thinks...
insane.

34:08.895 --> 34:10.929
But then I remember his father.

34:10.965 --> 34:17.770
And I think crazier
things have happened.

34:17.804 --> 34:21.070
Are we through?

34:21.105 --> 34:23.540
All right, set.

34:23.574 --> 34:24.790
A wife always wants to

34:24.824 --> 34:28.090
believe she's her
husband's greatest love.

34:28.125 --> 34:31.400
But long ago I made peace with

34:31.435 --> 34:34.699
the fact that I'm
in second place.

34:34.735 --> 34:39.639
I'm sorry.
Second place to who?

34:39.675 --> 34:42.440
To Abbudin.

34:42.690 --> 34:46.460
Your opponent, Sheik
Rashid, a sworn enemy of your

34:46.495 --> 34:48.330
family for over two decades,

34:48.364 --> 34:50.330
calls you either the bravest

34:50.364 --> 34:52.670
or the most foolish man
on the continent.

34:54.074 --> 34:55.340
That's really funny.

34:55.375 --> 34:59.840
I didn't know Sheik Rashid
has that sense of humor.

34:59.875 --> 35:04.210
Uh, but, uh... I
like Sheik Rashid.

35:04.245 --> 35:08.720
Uh, I would not vote
for him, for sure.

35:08.755 --> 35:10.520
But I like him.

35:10.555 --> 35:12.890
The people like him, too.

35:12.925 --> 35:14.860
He is leading in the polling.

35:14.895 --> 35:16.690
It's early to say.

35:16.725 --> 35:20.000
The elections are
a long way off.

35:20.035 --> 35:23.260
And I think, in time, people

35:23.270 --> 35:25.500
will realize that what they feel

35:25.535 --> 35:27.020
for the sheik is actually what

35:27.055 --> 35:29.340
you feel for an uncle that

35:29.375 --> 35:32.240
you haven't seen
for a long time.

35:32.275 --> 35:34.790
Uh, nostalgia.

35:34.825 --> 35:37.360
But if you look around, you can

35:37.395 --> 35:41.100
see what we have built
together, as a nation.

35:41.135 --> 35:44.370
And I'm sure you will
say, I love that.

35:44.405 --> 35:46.640
I want more of that.

35:46.675 --> 35:52.540
I want more of the people, of
the family, that did that.

35:52.550 --> 35:54.610
You sound very confident.

35:54.645 --> 35:55.610
Uh-huh.

35:55.620 --> 35:56.550
Would you be interested

35:56.585 --> 35:58.950
in hearing what the sheik
had to say about you?

36:00.985 --> 36:02.220
What do you make of

36:02.255 --> 36:04.710
this new, young
president Al Fayeed?

36:04.745 --> 36:05.710
Obviously, he

36:05.745 --> 36:08.380
marches to the beat
of his own drummer.

36:08.415 --> 36:11.080
And when you sit with him in a

36:11.115 --> 36:14.420
room, you know you are
sitting with a lion.

36:14.455 --> 36:19.220
Of course, not all lions are
friendly, and every so

36:19.255 --> 36:23.160
often one will bite your head off.

36:23.195 --> 36:25.360
But you have to admire his courage.

36:25.395 --> 36:27.700
He didn't have to allow
these elections.

36:27.735 --> 36:30.030
He could have simply said no.

36:30.065 --> 36:32.100
Yes.

36:32.135 --> 36:37.170
He knows wise counsel
when he hears it.

36:37.205 --> 36:39.340
Wise counsel?

36:39.375 --> 36:41.540
He has a younger brother.

36:41.575 --> 36:42.940
Bassam.

36:42.950 --> 36:44.350
An American.

36:44.385 --> 36:49.080
Like I said, Jamal
may be a lion.

36:49.090 --> 36:53.420
But I suspect his brother
is the lion tamer.

36:53.455 --> 36:57.030
The brother who tells
the lion what to do.

37:00.710 --> 37:02.250
We are getting reports

37:02.285 --> 37:05.050
that for the first time in
30 years, a significant

37:05.085 --> 37:06.980
number of young men of draft age

37:07.015 --> 37:08.950
are simply not showing
up for induction.

37:08.990 --> 37:11.920
This is despite the fact they know the
penalty is death or life imprisonment.

37:13.930 --> 37:16.690
Additionally, among men already
serving, we are seeing a

37:16.700 --> 37:19.430
measurable uptick in deserters.

37:19.465 --> 37:20.930
Again, these men are staring at

37:20.965 --> 37:24.940
certain death, and yet...
they don't care.

37:24.975 --> 37:27.540
And finally, assaults against

37:27.575 --> 37:30.070
officers by conscripted men are

37:30.080 --> 37:33.980
up 11% compared to this
same time last year.

37:34.015 --> 37:37.450
And why do you think this is?

37:37.485 --> 37:39.680
Shifting sands, Mr.
President.

37:39.690 --> 37:41.250
The country is sensing change.

37:41.285 --> 37:43.620
And change is not good
for the status quo.

37:43.655 --> 37:45.290
People don't obediently serve

37:45.325 --> 37:48.230
in a military they suspect
of being disbanded.

37:48.265 --> 37:49.390
And those already serving start

37:49.400 --> 37:51.130
looking for an exit strategy.

37:51.165 --> 37:52.860
It's human nature.

37:52.870 --> 37:54.530
Are you saying this is

37:54.565 --> 37:58.770
because I have
announced elections?

37:58.805 --> 38:01.240
Well, when you look at

38:01.275 --> 38:05.010
- the latest polling...
- Latest polling?

38:05.045 --> 38:08.310
Mr. President,
there is new polling.

38:08.345 --> 38:14.280
And unfortunately it shows you
just with 33% of the vote,

38:14.290 --> 38:20.260
while the sheik has
44% of the vote.

38:20.295 --> 38:22.260
That's not perfect.

38:22.295 --> 38:25.000
But... still early.

38:25.035 --> 38:29.330
And 44 to 33 is not
really terrible.

38:29.340 --> 38:30.330
No, Mr. President.

38:30.340 --> 38:31.670
It is not.

38:31.705 --> 38:35.010
Although it is somewhat
troubling that just two weeks

38:35.045 --> 38:39.580
ago you had 37 and he 41.

38:52.320 --> 38:57.830
Let me think
about all of that, okay?

38:57.865 --> 39:00.530
Thank you very much for your

39:00.565 --> 39:06.270
patience, for your support
and encouragements.

39:35.830 --> 39:37.990
Thank you.

39:46.850 --> 39:51.720
Forgive
me for not getting up.

39:51.755 --> 39:54.990
Some days the legs
cooperate happily.

39:55.025 --> 39:56.820
Some days they don't.

39:57.725 --> 40:01.390
- Please.
- Thank you.

40:03.660 --> 40:06.500
Thank you for, uh,
seeing me at such short notice.

40:06.535 --> 40:09.430
You
made it sound urgent.

40:09.940 --> 40:13.240
What was urgent was my

40:13.275 --> 40:15.110
brother not having to see me for

40:15.145 --> 40:17.670
a few days after hearing what

40:17.680 --> 40:21.280
<i>you said on "60 Minutes".</i>

40:23.755 --> 40:28.890
You knew exactly
what you were doing.

40:28.925 --> 40:32.660
Does it serve
my interests for there to be

40:32.695 --> 40:34.320
friction between the man I'm

40:34.330 --> 40:36.130
running against and the man I've

40:36.165 --> 40:38.330
come to believe is responsible

40:38.365 --> 40:41.230
for any success
he's experiencing?

40:41.265 --> 40:46.100
The answer is yes.

40:46.110 --> 40:47.940
Be flattered.

40:47.975 --> 40:51.740
You remind me of your father.

40:53.680 --> 40:55.510
Really?

40:55.545 --> 40:58.680
And is that a good
thing or a bad thing?

40:58.715 --> 40:59.980
This may shock

40:59.990 --> 41:04.820
you, but I considered your
father an extraordinary

41:04.855 --> 41:11.830
statesman right up until the
the moment he betrayed me.

41:11.865 --> 41:14.170
Don't you mean

41:14.205 --> 41:16.830
right up until the moment
you betrayed him?

41:17.240 --> 41:19.570
You bombed
an army barracks.

41:19.605 --> 41:23.110
Killed dozens of Abbudin
soldiers without provocation.

41:23.145 --> 41:24.270
Did I?

41:24.280 --> 41:26.110
It's what happened.

41:26.145 --> 41:28.750
You bombed us, we gassed you.

41:28.785 --> 41:30.350
Our sin was greater, but I doubt

41:30.385 --> 41:32.750
it would have happened if
you hadn't attacked first.

41:32.950 --> 41:35.890
I was looking
for a peace with a man I

41:35.925 --> 41:38.490
believed wanted the same thing.

41:38.525 --> 41:41.120
I never struck first.

41:41.130 --> 41:45.000
I never struck at all, nor
did any of my people.

41:45.035 --> 41:46.960
Then, who did?

41:46.970 --> 41:48.970
Maybe a man who

41:49.005 --> 41:56.740
wanted to gas 20,000 people
in Ma'an and needed a reason.

41:59.180 --> 42:01.180
So, you're saying my

42:01.215 --> 42:04.150
father sacrificed his
own men

42:04.185 --> 42:06.280
to give himself a reason
to attack Ma'an?

42:06.590 --> 42:07.890
I am offering a

42:07.925 --> 42:12.360
possible scenario,
no more, no less.

42:12.395 --> 42:16.760
But you didn't come here
to debate history with me.

42:16.795 --> 42:19.930
I'm here to
extend you an invitation.

42:19.965 --> 42:21.730
My brother would like you to be

42:21.765 --> 42:23.070
present for the signing of the

42:23.105 --> 42:25.670
motion to amend the constitution

42:25.705 --> 42:27.740
to allow free
elections in Abbudin.

42:27.775 --> 42:30.340
The
motion to amend.

42:30.375 --> 42:34.040
The tiny first step.

42:35.285 --> 42:37.720
I mean what I say.

42:38.020 --> 42:39.980
Those days before the attack on

42:39.990 --> 42:45.690
Ma'an, I really thought your
father was one of the most

42:45.725 --> 42:50.260
extraordinary individuals
I had ever met.

42:50.295 --> 42:54.900
I disagreed with almost
everything he stood for, but I

42:54.935 --> 42:57.100
admired his will to get things

42:57.135 --> 43:00.240
done, his willingness to listen

43:00.275 --> 43:03.910
to other opinions and ideas.

43:03.945 --> 43:10.610
You are... your father's son.

43:13.150 --> 43:16.190
I don't know why, but

43:16.225 --> 43:19.290
I can't seem to get the peoples'

43:19.325 --> 43:23.190
love.

43:23.200 --> 43:24.960
I give them elections.

43:24.995 --> 43:26.730
I free prisoners.

43:26.765 --> 43:30.370
Doesn't matter.

43:31.800 --> 43:35.710
Perhaps I'm just not lovable.

43:35.745 --> 43:40.810
<i>Well, I find
you very lovable.</i>

43:40.845 --> 43:44.050
Yeah, I know.

43:44.085 --> 43:48.790
I think I'm lovable, too,
but, the point is, when I...

43:48.825 --> 43:55.930
when I... when I think about
who actually loves me... Yeah.

43:55.965 --> 43:59.760
My father... He liked
me sometimes.

43:59.770 --> 44:01.630
Sometimes, yes.

44:01.665 --> 44:04.300
Sometimes, no.

44:04.335 --> 44:08.470
My mother... You know,
she's my mother.

44:08.505 --> 44:13.740
She... She loves her children
no matter who they are.

44:13.775 --> 44:17.680
And my brother.

44:17.715 --> 44:20.820
My younger brother.

44:20.855 --> 44:23.290
My little brother.

44:24.555 --> 44:28.760
I see him look at me with pity.

44:28.795 --> 44:36.600
I think he thinks that is love,
but I know it's just pity.

44:36.635 --> 44:42.210
That sounds very lonely.

44:42.245 --> 44:45.840
What about your wife?

44:52.255 --> 44:59.520
Well... I love you.

44:59.530 --> 45:01.960
Well, I know that.

45:01.995 --> 45:05.460
I... I can tell.

45:05.495 --> 45:09.400
With all your heart, right?

45:09.435 --> 45:11.200
With all my heart,

45:11.235 --> 45:14.910
Mr. President.

45:48.140 --> 45:49.740
Hey, don't jump.

45:49.775 --> 45:51.080
Screw the sheik.

45:51.580 --> 45:54.310
Does your boyfriend

45:54.345 --> 45:56.880
know you talk about
him like that?

45:58.280 --> 46:00.990
So, long time, no see.

46:01.025 --> 46:04.390
Hmm, I've been busy.

46:04.425 --> 46:09.390
You know, it's not easy
hanging onto 33% of the vote.

46:09.425 --> 46:11.360
I wanted to
talk to you about that.

46:11.395 --> 46:12.830
You know these polls are only

46:12.865 --> 46:15.570
accurate to within five points, right?
You know what that means?

46:16.240 --> 46:18.400
It means I'm losing?

46:18.435 --> 46:21.740
No, it means you could
have 38 points, and he could

46:21.775 --> 46:24.570
have 39, which basically
means you're in a dead heat.

46:24.580 --> 46:29.820
Well, tell that
to my trusted council.

46:29.855 --> 46:33.480
Down the hall, there are
people that have come from

46:33.490 --> 46:35.920
all over the world to see you do

46:35.955 --> 46:37.460
what you're about to do today.

46:37.560 --> 46:39.190
When you put your pen to that

46:39.225 --> 46:40.660
document, the world
will be different.

46:40.695 --> 46:42.090
How many men get the chance to

46:42.125 --> 46:46.060
effect that kind of
change in their lifetime?

46:46.070 --> 46:48.430
You are making history today.

46:48.465 --> 46:50.570
Really?

46:50.605 --> 46:54.240
You sure it's not you?

47:03.080 --> 47:05.480
Wow.

47:05.490 --> 47:07.820
Look at these two.

47:07.855 --> 47:09.850
Which one do you want?

47:09.860 --> 47:12.860
Are there two?

47:12.895 --> 47:16.030
I see only one.

47:16.065 --> 47:17.900
So, we'll, uh... we'll

47:17.935 --> 47:20.100
see you guys down
in the ballroom.

47:20.135 --> 47:22.530
They're setting up for some
pictures with the sheik,

47:22.540 --> 47:27.370
and then we'll move to
the actual signing.

47:32.075 --> 47:34.610
We were just out there.

47:34.645 --> 47:36.050
People seem to be very excited

47:36.085 --> 47:39.280
about what you are going to do.

47:39.290 --> 47:43.650
Are you?

47:43.660 --> 47:49.360
I think that you have
it in you to be... a great man

47:49.395 --> 47:50.960
and do great things.

47:51.060 --> 47:54.000
But do I think this
is one of them?

47:54.035 --> 47:55.670
I'm not sure.

47:55.705 --> 47:59.570
That doesn't change
how I feel about you.

47:59.605 --> 48:05.240
And how do
you feel about me?

48:05.275 --> 48:08.350
Jamal, if you
don't know by now...

48:08.385 --> 48:10.180
Oh, I plead for your

48:10.215 --> 48:14.850
love, and all I get is... anger.

48:14.885 --> 48:19.160
That's not true.

48:19.195 --> 48:25.500
Then... give me your love...
here, now.

48:33.870 --> 48:37.210
Don't be ridiculous.

48:37.245 --> 48:40.840
I'll meet you down there.

49:28.660 --> 49:31.330
Mr. President.

49:33.500 --> 49:37.330
He's a force of
nature, isn't he?

49:43.280 --> 49:45.840
Excuse me.

49:45.850 --> 49:47.580
I will be right back.

49:47.615 --> 49:51.250
Sure.

50:13.505 --> 50:15.010
Right through
that door, Sheik Rashid.

50:23.950 --> 50:30.320
So... this is where you are hiding.

50:32.455 --> 50:34.660
Great minds think alike.

50:36.195 --> 50:37.360
Ah.

50:47.135 --> 50:51.070
You are amazing to watch.

50:51.105 --> 50:53.610
The people... they
really love you.

50:54.485 --> 50:56.150
Well,
of course they do.

50:56.185 --> 50:58.280
I am a benign old man.

50:58.315 --> 50:59.920
What's not to love?

50:59.955 --> 51:03.650
I also love them right back.

51:04.720 --> 51:07.830
And my brother Bassam.

51:08.130 --> 51:10.830
Do you love him?

51:12.000 --> 51:16.370
I don't know
about love, but he is a very

51:16.405 --> 51:18.400
clever fellow, your brother.

51:18.435 --> 51:22.070
Very wise, very principled.

51:23.980 --> 51:27.010
I'll tell you another thing.

51:27.045 --> 51:30.280
There's not a morning I don't

51:30.315 --> 51:38.920
wake up and thank God I am
not running against him.

51:44.895 --> 51:46.100
Ah.

51:47.365 --> 51:48.430
Huh?

51:51.135 --> 51:52.870
You're okay?

51:58.375 --> 52:00.950
That's it, cough it up.

52:00.985 --> 52:02.110
Cough it up, old man.

52:03.385 --> 52:05.620
Cough the whole lung!

52:05.655 --> 52:08.390
You want me to get
Bassam to help you?

52:08.425 --> 52:10.790
You need a whack in the back.

52:15.295 --> 52:17.800
Did that help?

52:19.470 --> 52:21.130
How about that?

52:39.820 --> 52:43.820
You think everybody loves you?

52:43.855 --> 52:47.820
Well... forgive me.
I don't.
