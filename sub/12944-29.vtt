09:55.767 --> 09:57.233
Get with the program, Gordo.

09:58.967 --> 10:03.266
Yes, Gordo, I wrote out a few words
for Miranda to say to Ryan, okay?

10:03.333 --> 10:05.200
But look, now they have a date.

10:05.266 --> 10:08.400
That's... that's... genius.

10:09.834 --> 10:12.767
Like I said, when I'm good,
I'm really good.

10:12.834 --> 10:14.934
I told you that you and Ryan
would be H&amp;H.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.233
This is so awesome.

10:16.300 --> 10:18.567
Thanks to you.
Just meet me here a few minutes

10:18.633 --> 10:20.333
before lunch to go over
what we're going to say.

10:20.400 --> 10:22.533
Okay. Wait. What?

10:22.600 --> 10:26.266
I need you to be here without
actually being here. Understand?

10:26.333 --> 10:28.200
Finally gets interesting.

10:28.266 --> 10:30.066
I don't know, Miranda.

10:30.133 --> 10:31.700
All you have to do
is hide somewhere close

10:31.767 --> 10:33.934
listen to the way
the conversation is going

10:34.033 --> 10:35.567
and tell me what to say back to him.

10:35.633 --> 10:37.266
I won't be so nervous if you're here.

10:37.400 --> 10:38.834
Please?

10:40.400 --> 10:42.667
Okay, this is the worst idea
I've ever heard.

10:42.734 --> 10:44.467
There is no way I'm doing that.

10:45.100 --> 10:47.000
So, you'll come, right?

11:00.333 --> 11:02.100
We've got to invent games more often.

11:02.166 --> 11:04.100
I never do
stuff like this with Lizzie.

11:04.166 --> 11:05.166
Of course not.

11:05.233 --> 11:08.633
All this running around would
make her "break a nail."

Got that right.

talking to Ryan?

14:47.367 --> 14:48.867

I could talk to Ryan.

doesn't even work for me.

if you like someone before
I climb in a garbage can?

20:10.433 --> 20:11.533
[CHUCKLES] Sorry.

20:11.600 --> 20:14.467
By the way, even if Ryan
were the guy for me,

20:14.533 --> 20:16.900
I should have never let him
come between us.

20:16.967 --> 20:19.567
-I'm sorry.
-It's okay. We're friends.

20:19.633 --> 20:22.333
And even if we get in a fight,
and you walk away from me

20:22.400 --> 20:24.166
you'll always know
where to find me, okay?

20:24.233 --> 20:25.533
Right here.

20:25.600 --> 20:27.133
-Let's go find Gordo.
-Oh, cool, yeah.

20:29.200 --> 20:31.100
GORDO: I can't believe that
after all that drama,

20:31.166 --> 20:33.200
your crush on Ryan is actually over.

20:33.266 --> 20:36.133
And I can't believe
you're still talking about it.

20:36.200 --> 20:38.033
He's making up for lost time.

20:38.100 --> 20:39.200
I guess.

20:39.266 --> 20:40.867
Let's just say that you two guys

20:40.934 --> 20:43.667
aren't half as bad as the stuff
you talk about constantly.

20:43.767 --> 20:45.767
-[SCOFFS]
-It's good to be back.

20:47.033 --> 20:48.834
So, anyone hungry?

20:48.900 --> 20:50.734
-Oh, me.
-Me, too.

20:50.767 --> 20:52.600
There's some chips
in the kitchen. Let's go.

20:52.900 --> 20:55.433
I don't think you
want to eat the chips.

20:55.500 --> 20:56.834
Why not?

20:56.900 --> 20:58.600
Mm, never mind.

21:04.800 --> 21:06.700
MALE CREW MEMBER: Two mark.
FEMALE CREW MEMBER: One.

21:33.533 --> 21:34.834
Okay, that's it.

21:34.900 --> 21:37.500
Gloves are coming off,
walls are coming down.

21:37.567 --> 21:39.166
I'll show you who's shy.

21:41.500 --> 21:43.133
Very funny, guys.

you know, I like your sweater.

21:51.467 --> 21:53.633
-Uh, thanks, Lizzie.
