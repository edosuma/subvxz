WEBVTT

00:20.281 --> 00:22.718
If he finds out
that I was involved

00:22.718 --> 00:24.415
with his daughter disappearing...

00:24.415 --> 00:25.851
Who says
he has to find out?

00:25.851 --> 00:27.897
Joe Colombo's
doing a very good job,

00:27.897 --> 00:29.290
minding the store
and also protecting you, and--

00:29.290 --> 00:30.291
He's trying to fuck me.

00:30.291 --> 00:31.944
You just come from my father?

00:31.944 --> 00:34.382
Fineman told him about
what's going on with Colombo.

00:34.382 --> 00:36.166
Not gonna have to worry
about Joe Colombo anymore.

00:36.166 --> 00:38.255
I never said
I wanted him hurt.

00:40.214 --> 00:43.043
I understand he has plans
for a new mosque.

00:43.043 --> 00:44.609
Omar wants
to work for Malcolm.

00:44.609 --> 00:47.743
I want you to swear that
you will never do anything

00:47.743 --> 00:48.787
to harm Malcolm.

00:48.787 --> 00:51.225
I swear before Allah.

00:51.225 --> 00:53.923
Now it's your turn.
Swear you don't love me anymore.

00:53.923 --> 00:55.446
I'm not ready
for that just yet.

00:55.446 --> 00:57.405
- Omar's asked me out on a date.
- You have to forgive him

00:57.405 --> 00:59.494
if you're going to give
him a real chance.

00:59.494 --> 01:02.366
Malcolm is risking his life
to fight for our freedom.

01:02.366 --> 01:05.369
Omar, I thought you said
Elise was an intelligent woman.

01:06.675 --> 01:08.546
You don't want me to be
in the heroin business?

01:08.546 --> 01:11.941
If our quality of life
goes down, so be it.

01:11.941 --> 01:14.030
I love you more
than words can say.

01:14.030 --> 01:15.858
It shouldn't be difficult
to transfer

01:15.858 --> 01:17.990
Palmetto's ownership
to your name.

01:17.990 --> 01:19.470
Landing a contract like this

01:19.470 --> 01:20.776
could really push him
in the right direction.

01:20.776 --> 01:23.387
Your application
has been rejected.

01:23.387 --> 01:25.389
I will never do
anything criminal again.

01:25.389 --> 01:27.043
Jose says you have
a proposition for us.

01:27.043 --> 01:30.394
The CIA incinerates hundreds
of kilos of cocaine a month.

01:30.394 --> 01:31.395
Turn it over to us. We sell it.

01:31.395 --> 01:32.657
A quarter of the profits
go to you

01:32.657 --> 01:33.832
and the fight
against Castro.

01:33.832 --> 01:35.095
You have something we want.

01:35.095 --> 01:36.792
Intimate access to Malcolm X.

01:36.792 --> 01:40.100
You get us that, you boys
can have all the coke you want.

01:40.100 --> 01:41.275
Were you able to acquire
the information

01:41.275 --> 01:42.754
I requested about Malcolm?

01:42.754 --> 01:45.279
You and he and your daughter
met for lunch.

01:45.279 --> 01:48.064
I've done some research, too.
Operation Mongoose.

01:48.064 --> 01:51.459
Which would make headline news
if I were suddenly to disappear.

01:51.459 --> 01:53.374
So keep the fuck away
from Malcolm.

01:53.374 --> 01:55.419
You'll get 25%,
and there'll be no fuss.

01:55.419 --> 01:56.942
I'm fucking impressed.

01:56.942 --> 01:58.292
Let's get this shit
out of here.

01:58.292 --> 01:59.641
We're taking back Harlem.

01:59.641 --> 02:01.295
I got no fucking problem

02:01.295 --> 02:03.471
giving up information
on that commie Negro.

02:03.471 --> 02:05.081

Here comes trouble.

03:12.540 --> 03:15.151
Hey, Joe. What's up?

03:15.151 --> 03:17.545
Why you bringin' a crew
to the sit-down?

03:17.545 --> 03:20.461
'Cause I don't trust
none of you fucks!

03:20.461 --> 03:23.942
Chin Gigante
put a hit out on me--

03:23.942 --> 03:26.510
something he couldn't have done
without your fuckin' approval.

03:26.510 --> 03:28.730
What the fuck
are you talkin' about?

03:28.730 --> 03:30.079
I bring in all the dope,

03:30.079 --> 03:31.994
make millions
for you greedy bastards,

03:31.994 --> 03:33.648
got rid of
Bumpy fuckin' Johnson.

03:33.648 --> 03:35.476
This is how you repay me?

03:35.476 --> 03:38.130
Get the fuckin' sanction
taken off my head!

03:38.130 --> 03:41.046
Hey, tough guy, maybe
you should have thought twice

03:41.046 --> 03:42.874
before you fucked
Chin's daughter!

03:46.226 --> 03:48.924
- What?
- We got a couple of associates

03:48.924 --> 03:51.492
in Cell Block C in Sing Sing

03:51.492 --> 03:55.235
said Chin went a little berserk.

03:58.629 --> 04:03.417
I can't say I blame him
for tryin' to take you out.

04:03.417 --> 04:06.028
With all due respect, Joe--

04:06.028 --> 04:07.986
Joe, look at me
when I'm fuckin' talkin'.

04:07.986 --> 04:09.510
With all due respect,

04:09.510 --> 04:10.946
don't you think
it would've been smarter

04:10.946 --> 04:13.209
if you kept it
in your fuckin' pants?

04:13.209 --> 04:16.168
Listen to me good.

04:16.168 --> 04:20.521
I never fuckin'
touched his daughter.

04:20.521 --> 04:25.526
Whether you did or you didn't,
it's not our business,

04:25.526 --> 04:28.006
but that can explain
what the fuck is goin' on.

04:28.006 --> 04:32.968
Joseph, we have rules,
but a father's a father.

04:32.968 --> 04:35.536
A single boss sanctions
another boss,

04:35.536 --> 04:37.538
and you <i>pezzonovantes</i>
do nothing.

04:41.106 --> 04:43.413
This Commission
is fuckin' bullshit.

04:43.413 --> 04:45.067
You motherfuckers
are useless.

05:12.877 --> 05:16.228
You really did
move the shit.

05:16.228 --> 05:20.407
No business like show business
for the coke business.

05:21.973 --> 05:23.845
It was a smart plan.

05:23.845 --> 05:26.630
Go after the musicians,
then the managers,

05:26.630 --> 05:29.111
then the big-shot executives.

05:29.111 --> 05:31.679
They have all the dough.

05:31.679 --> 05:35.552
Harvey has 40 keys
for us tomorrow.

05:35.552 --> 05:37.075
Forty's too much.

05:37.075 --> 05:38.903
Got to roll it out slowly.

05:38.903 --> 05:40.688
You can move 40.

05:40.688 --> 05:43.517
You got an instinct
for this shit. I trust you.

05:45.867 --> 05:49.610
Boils down to it,
instinct's all we got.

05:49.610 --> 05:51.089
Alright.

05:54.919 --> 05:57.922
I really admire
how you stood your ground

05:57.922 --> 05:59.533
for your friend Malcolm X.

05:59.533 --> 06:01.273
He's my brother.

06:01.273 --> 06:04.189
You look after him,
keep him protected.

06:04.189 --> 06:07.671
Hey, why do you think
our friends in the CIA

06:07.671 --> 06:09.238
are so interested in him?

06:09.238 --> 06:12.154
They view him as the most
dangerous man in America.

06:12.154 --> 06:14.069
Why?

06:17.159 --> 06:20.249
Nobody knows this,
but Malcolm and Che

06:20.249 --> 06:22.730
are gonna be speaking
at the United Nations.

06:22.730 --> 06:24.384
That's just between me and you.

06:24.384 --> 06:26.647
I don't want nothing
to happen to Malcolm.

06:26.647 --> 06:29.693
I would never betray
your confidence.

06:29.693 --> 06:31.129
Never on my life.

06:44.665 --> 06:47.319
You boys come out
for a drink?

06:47.319 --> 06:50.148
Jose Battle, the FBI has
a warrant for your arrest.

06:50.148 --> 06:52.977
Who the fuck are you?

06:52.977 --> 06:55.763
I'm Assistant District Attorney
Jonathan Pike.

06:55.763 --> 06:58.200
You're being charged

- See you're packin' up.
- Yeah.

09:15.685 --> 09:17.165
Yeah, I'm going back up
to Philly

09:17.165 --> 09:20.168
to stay with Delia for a while.

09:20.168 --> 09:23.519
I want to thank you for
taking care of me for this time

09:23.519 --> 09:27.392
and understanding that I need
to go and find my own life.

09:30.308 --> 09:32.746
Before you go...

09:32.746 --> 09:36.097
maybe you could
give me some advice.

09:36.097 --> 09:37.185
About what?

09:39.579 --> 09:42.016
Well, for instance...

09:42.016 --> 09:44.235
why would your father

09:44.235 --> 09:48.457
think that you and I
are involved?

09:48.457 --> 09:49.763
Involved?

09:51.982 --> 09:53.244
In an intimate way.

09:54.855 --> 09:56.596
I have no idea.

10:00.948 --> 10:04.778
That could explain why
his underboss Lombardi

10:04.778 --> 10:08.477
tried to put a bullet
in my head, could it not?

10:08.477 --> 10:12.089
Nah, I don't think
that's it.

10:12.089 --> 10:15.527
Well, what would even give him
the idea that we're involved?

10:17.573 --> 10:19.140
Any thoughts?

10:19.140 --> 10:22.883
No. No, I have no idea.
You know my father.

10:22.883 --> 10:24.972
He's in a bathrobe
half the fuckin' time.

10:25.886 --> 10:28.453
I think there's something
you're not telling me.

10:28.453 --> 10:29.846
No.

10:30.934 --> 10:32.501
Honest.

10:35.330 --> 10:37.898
Stella...

10:37.898 --> 10:39.247
think hard.

10:41.031 --> 10:42.946
Why would Chin Gigante,

10:42.946 --> 10:45.209
who's charged me
with protecting his daughter,

10:45.209 --> 10:48.865
put out a fuckin' hit on me
with you in the room?

10:51.912 --> 10:55.002
It could have been
his lawyer.

10:55.002 --> 10:57.134
- Fineman?
- Yeah, I met with him.

10:57.134 --> 10:59.006
And he saw the necklace
that you gave me,

10:59.006 --> 11:02.444
and it's possible he drew
the wrong conclusions.

11:04.359 --> 11:07.579
- Fineman did?
- I think so.

11:07.579 --> 11:10.931
And did you try and dissuade him
from that notion?

11:10.931 --> 11:12.236
I did.

11:12.236 --> 11:16.980
Get that fuckin' lawyer
on the phone.

11:16.980 --> 11:19.461
Tell him you want to meet him immediately.

11:19.461 --> 11:21.158
What are you
gonna do to him?

11:21.158 --> 11:23.465
Whatever the fuck
it takes.

11:29.689 --> 11:31.995
What's goin' on here?

11:31.995 --> 11:35.085
Why is this guy Pike
crawling up our ass?

11:35.085 --> 11:37.958
This is the FBI
fuckin' with us.

11:37.958 --> 11:40.569
They've had a bug up their ass
over us since the '50s.

11:40.569 --> 11:43.224
The FBI and CIA are at war
with each other.

11:43.224 --> 11:45.661
You got to understand,
before we came along,

11:45.661 --> 11:46.923
they were Big Dick McGee.

11:46.923 --> 11:48.969
Now they're hall monitors.

11:48.969 --> 11:50.666
What I don't understand is,

11:50.666 --> 11:52.886
why'd they pinch Battle
and not me?

11:52.886 --> 11:54.670
Oh, 'cause they know
you don't sing,

11:54.670 --> 11:56.846
so take a shot
with your partner.

11:56.846 --> 12:01.416
More likely, they've got
a classified informant.

12:01.416 --> 12:03.244
A rat? Who?

12:05.072 --> 12:06.203
On your side.

12:08.902 --> 12:11.992
Who, besides us, has access
to the transactions?

12:13.254 --> 12:14.646
My banker.

12:14.646 --> 12:16.431
I got a judge and a lawyer
on payroll.

12:16.431 --> 12:17.911
But that's it, that's it.

12:17.911 --> 12:19.347
Anyone jump out?

12:20.174 --> 12:22.306
In my experience,
whichever one it is,

12:22.306 --> 12:24.700
they'll deny it
the strongest.

12:24.700 --> 12:27.355
I'll press our contacts,
see what I can pull.

12:27.355 --> 12:29.096
If we can't finger anybody
by evening time,

12:29.096 --> 12:30.488
they all got to go.

12:30.488 --> 12:32.099
Hey, motherfucker,
these are my people.

12:32.099 --> 12:34.971
I deal with them first,
and then I assess the situation.

12:34.971 --> 12:37.017
Talk to your guys.

12:37.017 --> 12:39.628
I will have Conrad
press our contacts.

12:39.628 --> 12:42.022
But be advised, boys,

12:42.022 --> 12:43.893
we find out one of your brothers
is the rat,

12:43.893 --> 12:47.723
they will be handled
with extreme prejudice.

13:13.793 --> 13:15.751
"Such a man as Malcolm

13:15.751 --> 13:17.666
deserves nothing
short of death."

13:19.407 --> 13:21.017
They should have drawn
Elijah Muhammad

13:21.017 --> 13:22.410
as the Big Bad Wolf.

13:25.195 --> 13:26.806
This isn't a joke.

13:26.806 --> 13:29.286
Elijah's blatantly ordering
his men to kill you.

13:29.286 --> 13:31.811
If the CIA couldn't kill me
with poison,

13:31.811 --> 13:33.682
the NOI won't do it
with a cartoon.

13:35.336 --> 13:36.554
Thank you.

13:36.554 --> 13:38.034
Brother Malcolm,
the United Nations

13:38.034 --> 13:40.471
has just confirmed
your speech with Che Guevara.

13:40.471 --> 13:42.038
Excellent.

13:42.038 --> 13:43.387
Don't worry about this.

13:43.387 --> 13:45.041
It'll be lining bird cages
by tomorrow.

13:45.041 --> 13:46.956
Malcolm, look around.

13:46.956 --> 13:50.090
These people gave up everything
to follow you.

13:50.090 --> 13:52.179
What will they do
if you end up in a casket?

13:52.179 --> 13:54.181
What would Betty do?

13:55.704 --> 13:58.272
I know I'm going to die, Elise.

13:58.272 --> 14:00.752
I'm making the most
of borrowed time.

14:00.752 --> 14:03.755
That doesn't have to be true.
You can stop this.

14:03.755 --> 14:06.323
I've been in 12 cities
in the past few months.

14:06.323 --> 14:08.108
In each one,
someone was following me.

14:08.108 --> 14:09.152
I can't even tie my shoes

14:09.152 --> 14:10.719
without looking
over my shoulder.

14:10.719 --> 14:13.243
That doesn't mean you give up.
What's wrong with you?

14:13.243 --> 14:15.115
I'm tired of running.

14:18.640 --> 14:20.076
If anyone comes after me,

14:20.076 --> 14:21.817
I'll be waiting
with my dukes up,

14:21.817 --> 14:25.342
not hiding behind a bush.

14:30.434 --> 14:35.222
Malcolm's new followers must
have a death wish, same as he.

14:35.222 --> 14:37.441
How could they leave the
Dear Holy Apostle to follow him?

14:37.441 --> 14:42.011
You know how Malcolm does,
how he brainwashes people.

14:42.011 --> 14:46.233
I know I brought shame to the
Nation for failing so terribly.

14:46.233 --> 14:48.278
You and Captain Henry
were the only ones

14:48.278 --> 14:51.020
who had courage enough
to take action.

14:51.020 --> 14:53.153
You are a hero.

14:53.153 --> 14:55.285
It's a shame
it cost Henry his life.

14:55.285 --> 14:59.768
In a way, what you're doing now
is even more potent--

14:59.768 --> 15:02.553
feigning friendship.

15:02.553 --> 15:05.382
Soon, Malcolm will let
all his guards down.

15:08.342 --> 15:10.648
It's really wonderful
to see you again, Omar.

15:12.824 --> 15:15.479
We have always had
similar ambitions.

15:16.872 --> 15:20.223
I'm inspired by your tenacity.

15:20.223 --> 15:24.184
Perhaps there's an opportunity
for us...

15:24.184 --> 15:26.055
to collaborate.

15:28.318 --> 15:29.929
What did you have in mind?

15:29.929 --> 15:36.500
If Mosque Number 7 was compelled
to any further action,

15:36.500 --> 15:38.154
you would know.

15:40.156 --> 15:41.853
There's nothing
really to speak of.

15:41.853 --> 15:43.203
We both know
that's not true.

15:43.203 --> 15:45.727
Thanks to you
and Henry's incident,

15:45.727 --> 15:48.164
we've had to lay low.

15:48.164 --> 15:49.557
Henry and I
had the courage

15:49.557 --> 15:52.821
to do what others
only whispered about.

15:52.821 --> 15:56.607
I don't want his death
to be in vain.

15:56.607 --> 16:00.481
Help me finish
what we started.

16:05.268 --> 16:07.836
Our sister mosque in Newark,

16:07.836 --> 16:09.620
they stepped up
to the front line.

16:11.753 --> 16:14.669
Brother Clyde
is who you should speak with.

16:27.290 --> 16:29.771
How you doing?

16:29.771 --> 16:31.642
Compared to La Cabaña Prison
in Cuba,

16:31.642 --> 16:35.646
where I spent two years,
this is paradise.

16:35.646 --> 16:39.215
Still, I need to
get the fuck out.

16:39.215 --> 16:41.391
The FBI has a snitch.

16:41.391 --> 16:44.525
Our friends think that
it's one of my associates.

16:44.525 --> 16:46.483
I disagree.

16:46.483 --> 16:49.225
Our friends know
what they're talkin' about.

16:49.225 --> 16:52.315
Probably one of those three
cocksuckers you brought to me.

16:53.447 --> 16:56.363
My guts tell me that they
got nothing to do with this.

16:56.363 --> 16:58.495
But I will talk to them.

16:58.495 --> 17:01.194
Could it be a snitch
coming from your side?

17:01.194 --> 17:03.370
Impossible.

17:03.370 --> 17:07.026
My men know that they will die
a very slow and painful death.

17:07.026 --> 17:09.506
Something just--
just doesn't make any sense.

17:11.421 --> 17:13.380
And why am I in here
and not you?

17:13.380 --> 17:15.382
It's a good question.

17:15.382 --> 17:16.731
It's obvious.

17:16.731 --> 17:19.299
One of your friends
made a deal.

17:19.299 --> 17:21.779
They turn on me
so as not to betray you.

17:21.779 --> 17:24.391
Probably
that fat-ass judge.

17:25.305 --> 17:27.176
Just give me some time
to figure this out.

17:27.176 --> 17:28.873
Just trust me.

17:30.005 --> 17:33.313
It's a little difficult
to do in my position.

17:33.313 --> 17:36.707
I've been in many prisons,
aside from Alcatraz.

17:38.622 --> 17:42.539
There's no one who wants
your freedom more than me.

17:42.539 --> 17:44.367
Do what you must.

17:44.367 --> 17:47.066
Find out which one
of your friends put me here.

17:47.066 --> 17:50.939
'Cause if you don't,
our friends will.

18:02.733 --> 18:04.344
Get the fuck out.

18:15.398 --> 18:18.706
I told you,
there's nothing I can do.

18:23.406 --> 18:27.410
You better fuckin'
think of something.

18:27.410 --> 18:30.370
He's in solitary.

18:30.370 --> 18:33.460
Even if I could speak to him,
you think he listens to me?

18:33.460 --> 18:35.462
No one can tell him
what to do.

18:35.462 --> 18:37.812
Joe, stop.

18:37.812 --> 18:40.858
He's right. When it comes to me,
my father's insane.

18:40.858 --> 18:43.861
Yeah, that much is clear.

18:46.473 --> 18:50.303
There is something else.

18:50.303 --> 18:52.435
What the fuck
are you not tellin' me?

18:52.435 --> 18:54.307
Nothing.

18:54.307 --> 18:57.005
Oh, f-- Oh, fuck!

18:57.005 --> 18:58.833
A couple weeks ago,

18:58.833 --> 19:02.532
I cut a man's head off
with a fuckin' handsaw.

19:02.532 --> 19:04.360
You think I won't blow
your fuckin' brains

19:04.360 --> 19:05.361
all over that wall?

19:06.754 --> 19:08.451
He thinks you're cheating him.

19:10.323 --> 19:11.628
What the f--

19:11.628 --> 19:14.849
His cut last month
was $2 million!

19:14.849 --> 19:16.546
He's never made
that much off heroin!

19:16.546 --> 19:17.504
That's a fact!

19:20.463 --> 19:24.119
You think that crazy act of his
is just an act?

19:24.119 --> 19:26.904
I think
he is legally insane.

19:26.904 --> 19:29.472
He's not crazy
when it comes to business.

19:29.472 --> 19:31.648
He thinks you're getting too
powerful with the other bosses

19:31.648 --> 19:34.477
because you're making them
so much money.

19:34.477 --> 19:36.436
He's worried that
you're gonna take Harlem.

19:36.436 --> 19:39.526
I protected Harlem!
I protected you!

19:41.441 --> 19:44.531
- Untie him.
- Yeah, boss.

19:59.241 --> 20:01.852
As of this moment,
I am resigning as his lawyer.

20:01.852 --> 20:03.854
I am not cut out
for this shit.

20:03.854 --> 20:07.118
You're gonna stay exactly
where the fuck you are.

20:08.337 --> 20:11.471
You're gonna clean up this lie
about me and Stella.

20:11.471 --> 20:13.647
You're gonna tell me every
fuckin' thing he says and does.

20:15.388 --> 20:17.477
If I do that, he'll kill me.

20:17.477 --> 20:20.523
I'll kill you if you don't.

20:20.523 --> 20:22.438
Your choice.

20:26.529 --> 20:27.574
Huh.

20:29.880 --> 20:32.535
Excuse me?

20:32.535 --> 20:34.537
Are you
suggesting that--

20:34.537 --> 20:37.627
The DA confirmed that there's
a confidential informant.

20:37.627 --> 20:39.586
- I do not have to endure--
- Sit-- Sit the fuck down!

20:39.586 --> 20:41.501
Sit the fuck--

20:45.200 --> 20:46.593
This is outrageous.

20:46.593 --> 20:48.464
I mean, what good would it do
any one of us,

20:48.464 --> 20:51.250
after all the things
we've been involved in?

20:51.250 --> 20:53.774
Have any of you
been approached...

20:53.774 --> 20:56.559
by the Feds?

20:56.559 --> 20:59.170
People can die
from this shit.

20:59.170 --> 21:01.216
I need the truth.

21:01.216 --> 21:03.610
No.

21:03.610 --> 21:05.046
Never.

21:05.046 --> 21:06.395
- Judge?
- No.

21:06.395 --> 21:09.616
- Dayton?
- No.

21:09.616 --> 21:11.531
Why are you certain
it's one of us?

21:11.531 --> 21:13.576
No one else has access
to those documents.

21:22.585 --> 21:24.283
I'm gonna get real...

21:24.283 --> 21:28.809
and ask you as a brother
of the Lenox Hill Society.

21:28.809 --> 21:32.856
Did one of you talk to the Feds?

21:34.858 --> 21:37.426
On your most sacred honor.

21:42.953 --> 21:44.303
Let me
make something clear

21:44.303 --> 21:46.435
about our relationship
with you, Bumpy.

21:49.003 --> 21:51.266
Your forthrightness,
your integrity,

21:51.266 --> 21:52.920
your loyalty
to our fraternity

21:52.920 --> 21:55.009
have had
a profound effect on us.

21:55.009 --> 21:57.228
We admire you.

21:58.621 --> 22:00.144
You keep your word.

22:01.798 --> 22:03.670
We've had our differences.

22:03.670 --> 22:06.063
However, we know that you
would never betray any of us.

22:06.063 --> 22:10.285
And following your lead,
we would never betray you.

22:10.285 --> 22:11.939
I haven't done it.

22:13.680 --> 22:17.205
And I believe my brothers
would never do such a thing.

22:23.559 --> 22:26.693
So...

22:26.693 --> 22:30.087
guess this wasn't just about him
thinking you were in my pants.

22:32.525 --> 22:34.701
Uh, he was using you
for something

22:34.701 --> 22:36.311
he was gonna do anyway.

22:37.704 --> 22:40.707
Take me out.

22:40.707 --> 22:45.233
That doesn't make it any better
that I got you in trouble.

22:45.233 --> 22:48.279
Maybe you can appreciate
why I want to leave the country.

22:52.109 --> 22:53.110
Hey.

22:55.286 --> 22:57.201
It's not your fight.

22:57.201 --> 22:58.942
It's mine.

22:58.942 --> 23:01.554
You want to take off...

23:01.554 --> 23:04.731
I owe you that
for saving my life.

23:12.739 --> 23:14.436
I lied to you, Joe.

23:17.308 --> 23:19.441
It wasn't the necklace
that did it.

23:21.617 --> 23:24.751
I told Fineman
you tried to fuck me.

23:24.751 --> 23:25.882
Ohh.

23:25.882 --> 23:27.667
I'm sorry.

23:27.667 --> 23:31.061
I told him not to say anything
to my father, but he did anyway.

23:31.061 --> 23:34.064
Do you have any idea
what you've done?

23:36.719 --> 23:39.635
Everything
I've worked for...

23:39.635 --> 23:42.595
destroyed.

23:42.595 --> 23:48.122
You made your father
my blood enemy for life.

23:48.122 --> 23:50.820
I got you into this mess.
I'll get you out.

23:52.779 --> 23:54.345
I know how to handle
my father.

23:55.999 --> 23:57.348
How?

23:57.348 --> 23:59.699
The other bosses.

23:59.699 --> 24:02.745
What if they all agree
to sanction him?

24:02.745 --> 24:04.268
What would that do?

24:04.268 --> 24:06.967
It means if he kills me,
they kill him.

24:06.967 --> 24:08.316
But forget it.

24:08.316 --> 24:10.753
They'll never do it,
those fucks.

24:10.753 --> 24:13.103
- Unless you force them.
- Wha--

24:13.103 --> 24:16.367
No, you forget, one of those
bosses tried to have me killed.

24:16.367 --> 24:20.676
We figure out who that was,
use it as leverage.

24:23.200 --> 24:24.811
You don't know which boss.

24:24.811 --> 24:26.900
I know someone who does.

24:33.254 --> 24:36.779
You can be
a great asset for us,

24:36.779 --> 24:38.389
given all that you learned
about Malcolm.

24:38.389 --> 24:40.479
That's why I came here.

24:40.479 --> 24:43.656
I want to help ensure
your plans will succeed.

24:43.656 --> 24:47.834
I want to be on the front lines
with you, Brother Clyde.

24:47.834 --> 24:50.489
Because of your
initial attempt,

24:50.489 --> 24:53.013
I think it best
you remain behind the scenes.

24:54.928 --> 24:56.364
You just said
I'd make a great asset.

24:56.364 --> 24:57.931
I can tell you
where Malcolm works, sleeps,

24:57.931 --> 24:59.498
when his guards
switch shifts.

24:59.498 --> 25:04.677
Which makes you a beneficial
informant, not a soldier.

25:08.855 --> 25:10.813
Brother Omar.

25:17.951 --> 25:20.910
You're back.
I've wondered about you.

25:21.781 --> 25:24.523
Have you and Elise
reconciled?

25:25.828 --> 25:28.048
It has, uh...

25:28.048 --> 25:29.658
been a process.

25:31.225 --> 25:32.835
I worry about her.

25:34.489 --> 25:38.885
Malcolm has her so deceived.
She needs you.

25:40.843 --> 25:41.801
I wish she felt that way.

25:41.801 --> 25:45.500
Sondra...
let's not pry

25:45.500 --> 25:47.284
into Brother Omar's
personal business.

25:47.284 --> 25:48.329
No, no, it's--

25:48.329 --> 25:50.157
Please.

25:50.157 --> 25:51.724
Excuse my wife.

25:51.724 --> 25:53.377
It's the truth.

25:55.379 --> 25:57.686
He almost saved the Nation.

26:01.864 --> 26:05.564
It's taken dozens of us to do
what he did all by himself.

26:18.315 --> 26:20.796
There may be some people
interested in you.

26:23.538 --> 26:25.496
Let's call them
higher powers.

26:28.151 --> 26:29.631
Higher powers?

26:31.372 --> 26:35.942
The kind not bound by
the principles of the Quran.

26:42.601 --> 26:44.254
It's nice
to see you, Bill.

26:44.254 --> 26:47.954
I figured you might stop by
at some point, catch up.

26:47.954 --> 26:49.172
Oh, you know me, Johnny,

26:49.172 --> 26:52.132
always shamelessly glomming
for a favor.

26:52.132 --> 26:54.874
Hmm. And what's that?

26:54.874 --> 26:56.484
Drop the charges
against Jose Battle

26:56.484 --> 27:00.488
and release him before,
I don't know, lunch.

27:00.488 --> 27:02.229
And why would I
consider releasing

27:02.229 --> 27:04.535
a suspected drug trafficker
and killer?

27:04.535 --> 27:07.451
'Cause we both know
it's not about that, John.

27:07.451 --> 27:08.975
Jose Battle
is a nuisance arrest

27:08.975 --> 27:11.630
to keep us from using him
against a high-value target.

27:11.630 --> 27:14.502
The target's no longer
on foreign soil.

27:14.502 --> 27:16.635
He's FBI jurisdiction now.

27:16.635 --> 27:18.593
You boys are all about

27:18.593 --> 27:22.641
the governmental blue ribbons
and nice press, huh?

27:24.207 --> 27:27.515
You guys had your chance
on Malcolm in Africa.

27:27.515 --> 27:28.690
You blew it.

27:30.387 --> 27:32.346
Malcolm X has moved

27:32.346 --> 27:35.305
from being a ghetto domestic
threat of limited consequence

27:35.305 --> 27:37.786
to a man of
international influence.

27:37.786 --> 27:40.223
He's speaking at the fuckin' UN,
for Christ's sake.

27:40.223 --> 27:44.924
The FBI is not equipped
to handle the ramifications.

27:44.924 --> 27:47.187
Just stick to catching
bank robbers.

27:47.187 --> 27:49.668
How's that--
the Castro thing going?

27:49.668 --> 27:52.888
You, uh, blow up
any cigars lately?

27:52.888 --> 27:54.542
Let's look at it this way.

27:54.542 --> 27:58.154
The director of the FBI,
Mr. Hoover,

27:58.154 --> 28:00.113
answers to the Attorney General.

28:00.113 --> 28:03.246
When the CIA calls
President Johnson

28:03.246 --> 28:04.639
and he's taking a shit,

28:04.639 --> 28:07.033
he picks up before
he wipes his ass.

28:09.078 --> 28:12.342
Battle's mine right now.

28:12.342 --> 28:15.084
I'm sorry if that
creates a nuisance.

28:22.918 --> 28:26.095
I have photographs
of your boss, J. Edgar,

28:26.095 --> 28:31.057
wearing an Edith Overall summer
dress and a crooked blond wig.

28:31.057 --> 28:34.930
I want Jose Battle
out of jail, pronto.

28:34.930 --> 28:37.063
Ease my Troublin' Mind" plays]

28:40.196 --> 28:45.027
<i>♪ I wish somebody, yeah ♪</i>

28:45.027 --> 28:50.598
<i>♪ Would come and ease
my troublin' mind ♪</i>

28:50.598 --> 28:53.470
Sweet potato pie?

28:53.470 --> 28:55.516
Is it a holiday today?

28:55.516 --> 28:58.040
I miss something? Huh?

28:58.040 --> 28:59.520
It's Margaret's
favorite dessert.

28:59.520 --> 29:01.043
Hmm.

29:01.043 --> 29:02.175
I know she's not here
right now,

29:02.175 --> 29:05.656
but makes me feel better
to make it.

29:05.656 --> 29:08.137
She'll be back soon,
I promise.

29:10.096 --> 29:11.445
I need to ask you
a favor.

29:11.445 --> 29:13.708
I got to get this pie
into the oven.

29:13.708 --> 29:15.666
It's important.
About Lillian.

29:17.277 --> 29:18.887
Lillian?

29:18.887 --> 29:21.194
What about her?

29:21.194 --> 29:22.978
You've often mentioned
how she complains

29:22.978 --> 29:24.545
about never going on vacation
with Archie.

29:25.981 --> 29:28.288
I need you
to encourage her to go.

29:28.288 --> 29:30.203
Why?

29:30.203 --> 29:33.772
Tell her that I bought plane
tickets and we can't use them.

29:33.772 --> 29:35.469
And then just give them
to her, okay?

29:35.469 --> 29:39.038
You want me to convince Lillian
to go away with her husband,

29:39.038 --> 29:41.127
and you won't tell me why?

29:41.127 --> 29:43.390
Archie's been doing
some work for me.

29:43.390 --> 29:45.000
And there's some people

29:45.000 --> 29:47.002
that think that he might
be talking to the Feds.

29:47.002 --> 29:49.439
They could be right.

29:49.439 --> 29:51.746
Ellsworth, what have you
gotten him into?

29:51.746 --> 29:54.314
Nothing that he didn't want
to get into.

29:54.314 --> 29:57.621
- Well, is he in danger?
- Not if he goes away.

29:57.621 --> 30:01.103
I just want him out of town
while I clean this up.

30:01.103 --> 30:03.105
Lillian mustn't know
anything about this, okay?

30:03.105 --> 30:05.325
This is outrageous.

30:05.325 --> 30:08.110
What are we talking about?

30:08.110 --> 30:10.156
Money laundering?

30:10.156 --> 30:13.333
Drug dealing?
You're back selling dope?

30:13.333 --> 30:14.682
I want to know!

30:14.682 --> 30:18.077
Please, it's not
what you think it is.

30:18.077 --> 30:21.471
You don't want to know
what I'm thinking.

30:21.471 --> 30:23.996
Just make sure
they leave.

30:23.996 --> 30:26.433
The sooner, the better.

30:53.764 --> 30:58.508
Oh! Jesus Christ!
You scared the shit out of me!

30:58.508 --> 31:00.293
Sorry, Olympia.

31:00.293 --> 31:01.685
I would have called
in advance,

31:01.685 --> 31:04.297
but I figured you don't want
to talk to me.

31:07.866 --> 31:09.998
Hello, Mrs. Gigante.

31:13.262 --> 31:15.743
What the fuck
do you two want?

31:15.743 --> 31:17.440
Information.

31:17.440 --> 31:20.052
Who'd you get to put
the hit out on me?

31:20.052 --> 31:22.837
Gambino? Lucchese?

31:22.837 --> 31:26.754
I don't know what the fuck
you're talkin' about.

31:26.754 --> 31:28.887
And I don't have time
for this shit.

31:30.801 --> 31:35.197
Get the fuck out of my house
before I call the cops.

31:42.422 --> 31:44.467
Who did you go to?

31:47.296 --> 31:48.907
I ain't sayin' nothing.

31:50.604 --> 31:52.562
And you two
are gonna rot in hell.

31:55.696 --> 31:59.918
I am a gentleman.

31:59.918 --> 32:04.226
Please do not make me
be discourteous.

32:04.226 --> 32:06.663
You realize you're signing
your death warrant,

32:06.663 --> 32:08.143
threatening me, right?

32:10.624 --> 32:13.496
Your husband
already wants me dead.

32:13.496 --> 32:16.804
I got nothing to lose.

32:16.804 --> 32:21.113
You won't tell us who,
we'll dig up the body,

32:21.113 --> 32:24.246
see if I recognize
the bastard.

32:24.246 --> 32:25.465
Let's go.

32:27.162 --> 32:28.337
Now!

32:39.305 --> 32:41.785
Holy shit!
I'm gonna fuckin' puke.

32:41.785 --> 32:43.526
Just keep
fuckin' diggin'.

32:45.267 --> 32:47.530
You're both sick,
and this is sick.

32:49.271 --> 32:51.317
Or you could just tell us
who it was.

32:51.317 --> 32:53.145
Fuck you.

32:53.145 --> 32:56.191
Why don't you go ask Lombardi
who put the hit out on you, huh?

32:56.191 --> 32:58.150
Lombardi's dead.

32:58.150 --> 32:59.281
They killed him, too.

33:06.332 --> 33:09.988
I always knew that little-girl
act of yours was pure bullshit.

33:12.686 --> 33:13.730
Got something, boss.

33:20.781 --> 33:22.696
Ah, he looks like
a lot of guys.

33:27.962 --> 33:29.529
Alright, keep digging.

33:29.529 --> 33:31.618
I doubt if there's anything
in his pockets,

33:31.618 --> 33:34.621
but doesn't hurt to check.

33:36.927 --> 33:39.321
Smell that?

33:39.321 --> 33:41.802
Rotting corpse.

33:41.802 --> 33:43.717
You know, we wouldn't have to
go through all this

33:43.717 --> 33:45.023
if you just told us.

33:54.336 --> 33:56.382
- Okay, boss.
- You're one tough broad.

33:56.382 --> 33:57.644
I'll give you that.

34:20.232 --> 34:22.756
Oh, shit.

34:22.756 --> 34:24.192
It's Frank Barboza.

34:26.412 --> 34:27.761
How do you know?

34:27.761 --> 34:30.068
The watch.

34:30.068 --> 34:32.940
It's a Rolex 1060
with a diamond dial.

34:32.940 --> 34:34.376
He always wore it.

34:34.376 --> 34:37.336
Know who gave him
this watch?

34:37.336 --> 34:40.948
Tommy Lucchese.

34:40.948 --> 34:42.602
They were like brothers.

34:42.602 --> 34:45.779
Frank was his
most trusted hit man.

34:45.779 --> 34:47.346
So?

34:47.346 --> 34:50.914
So you convinced Lucchese
to do the job.

34:50.914 --> 34:52.568
How'd you do it?

35:28.387 --> 35:31.390
Isn't it wonderful Bumpy
gave us these tickets?

35:31.390 --> 35:32.913
He was taking Mayme
to the Caymans,

35:32.913 --> 35:36.308
and he had some sort of
last-minute business meeting.

35:36.308 --> 35:39.398
Yes, indeed.

35:39.398 --> 35:40.834
Archie, what's wrong?

35:43.097 --> 35:47.319
Why'd he suddenly give us these
travel tickets out of nowhere?

35:47.319 --> 35:48.842
You thought of that?

35:48.842 --> 35:52.150
What's gotten into you?
He's being generous.

35:52.150 --> 35:55.283
Yes, and I have a bridge
I'd like to sell you.

36:01.376 --> 36:03.509
Oh! Aah!

36:03.509 --> 36:04.814
Oh!

36:04.814 --> 36:07.339
Archie! Oh, God!

36:07.339 --> 36:10.298
Archie! Archie!

36:26.358 --> 36:28.098
You caused the biggest
fuckin' mess for me

36:28.098 --> 36:30.100
by arresting Jose Battle.

36:31.624 --> 36:33.060
I just had to shoot
Bumpy Johnson's lawyer

36:33.060 --> 36:35.802
'cause I needed a fall guy.

36:38.544 --> 36:40.459
You got any new information
for me,

36:40.459 --> 36:42.417
or you just come
to complain, Conrad?

36:44.811 --> 36:46.508
I found out Malcolm X
and Che Guevara

36:46.508 --> 36:48.336
are planning to speak
at the UN.

36:48.336 --> 36:50.599
Those commie fucks want
to spread their propaganda

36:50.599 --> 36:54.864
not just in this country,
but throughout the world.

36:56.518 --> 36:58.085
What's Harvey gonna do?

36:58.085 --> 37:01.349
That fat fuck doesn't just
lay his plans out on the table.

37:02.916 --> 37:06.006
You've been undercover with him
for over a year, Agent Conrad.

37:06.006 --> 37:07.486
You need to dig deeper.

37:07.486 --> 37:11.490
Listen, asshole,
you're putting me in danger.

37:11.490 --> 37:12.534
And now Bumpy Johnson's
involved,

37:12.534 --> 37:14.493
and he's
growing suspicious.

37:14.493 --> 37:17.452
Johnson's not gonna stop us
or the CIA from getting Malcolm.

37:17.452 --> 37:22.501
Just-- Just figure out what
Harvey's next move is, okay?

37:22.501 --> 37:24.416
Look, all I can tell you
is he's determined

37:24.416 --> 37:26.331
to get Malcolm
before the FBI does.

37:28.594 --> 37:30.813
This getting too hot for you?

37:30.813 --> 37:33.599
You want off
this detail?

37:33.599 --> 37:36.906
Look, I want Malcolm X
just as bad as J. Edgar Hoover.

37:36.906 --> 37:40.040
But from now on,
you let me handle Harvey,

37:40.040 --> 37:42.042
and stay the fuck
out of it.

37:44.131 --> 37:45.698
Fuckin' asshole.

37:57.449 --> 38:00.234
- Welcome home, Jose.
<i>- Gracias.</i>

38:00.234 --> 38:02.628
Congratulations
on gettin' out.

38:02.628 --> 38:05.892
Bumpy, it's all
gonna be fine, man.

38:10.288 --> 38:12.159
How'd you get out
so fast?

38:12.159 --> 38:15.205
- Witness had a change of heart.
- It stopped beating.

38:15.205 --> 38:17.512
What the fuck you talkin' about?

38:17.512 --> 38:20.472
The Feds arrested Jose 'cause
Archie Gaines was a snitch.

38:20.472 --> 38:21.516
We took care of it.

38:21.516 --> 38:23.039
What'd you do?

38:23.039 --> 38:25.128
The FBI handed us
undeniable proof.

38:25.128 --> 38:26.826
What proof?

38:26.826 --> 38:29.089
Archie Gaines visited
the Federal Building downtown

38:29.089 --> 38:32.048
on the 14th and 17th.
He talked.

38:32.048 --> 38:33.789
And the cherry on top--

38:33.789 --> 38:35.443
he and his wife were fleeing
to the Cayman Islands

38:35.443 --> 38:37.140
when we got him.

38:49.631 --> 38:52.634
Why would anyone
do that to him?

38:52.634 --> 38:53.635
I don't know.

38:53.635 --> 38:56.682
Archie would never
hurt a fly.

38:56.682 --> 38:59.641
He was a great man.

39:01.600 --> 39:05.343
We met when we were 15.

39:05.343 --> 39:06.735
We've been together
ever since.

39:06.735 --> 39:08.084
I know.

39:08.084 --> 39:09.956
I can't understand it.

39:09.956 --> 39:11.436
Just as we were going away.

39:13.002 --> 39:14.830
Well, did you talk
to the police?

39:14.830 --> 39:17.267
- Oh.
- What did they say?

39:17.267 --> 39:18.834
They won't do anything.

39:18.834 --> 39:20.445
I know it.

39:22.621 --> 39:25.537
You have to ask Bumpy.

39:25.537 --> 39:28.366
- Ask him what?
- Find out who did this.

39:28.366 --> 39:32.021
Deliver justice to me.
I know he can do it.

39:32.021 --> 39:33.762
Please.

39:33.762 --> 39:36.896
You and Bumpy are the only
people in the world I trust.

39:36.896 --> 39:38.637
Ohh.

39:46.296 --> 39:47.646
What the fuck is that?

39:47.646 --> 39:49.822
Oh, it's a present.

39:49.822 --> 39:51.214
From Frank Barboza.

39:51.214 --> 39:53.695
Frank Barboza?
He's in Florida.

39:53.695 --> 39:55.784
He's dead.

39:55.784 --> 39:58.744
Thanks to
Stella Gigante.

39:58.744 --> 40:00.920
Got to admit,
she's one tough broad.

40:00.920 --> 40:04.184
What the fuck does that
have to do with me?

40:16.762 --> 40:19.155
Olympia.
What the fuck is going on?

40:19.155 --> 40:21.027
He knows, Tommy.

40:23.159 --> 40:24.596
He knows everything.

40:25.814 --> 40:29.775
You not only put a hit out
on a boss's daughter,

40:29.775 --> 40:31.385
you also fucked his wife.

40:31.385 --> 40:34.040
You think I offered him
this information?

40:34.040 --> 40:36.738
Tommy, he threatened me.
I had no choice!

40:38.436 --> 40:40.350
Joey, get her the fuck
out of here!

40:40.350 --> 40:42.004
This is no place
for a woman.

40:42.004 --> 40:44.137
Get her out of here, Joe.

40:44.137 --> 40:46.574
Alright, go ahead.

40:51.579 --> 40:53.625
Yeah, I don't know, Tommy.

40:53.625 --> 40:57.019
If I was you, I'd want
to keep this quiet, you know?

40:59.761 --> 41:01.850
What the fuck you want, Joe?

41:01.850 --> 41:03.722
I need you and the other bosses

41:03.722 --> 41:05.941
to sanction Chin
for the hit on me.

41:05.941 --> 41:07.943
Even if I get the other bosses
to agree

41:07.943 --> 41:11.730
to this sanction against Chin,
in fuckin' prison,

41:11.730 --> 41:15.473
what stops him from runnin'
to the fuckin' Feds for safety?

41:15.473 --> 41:18.388
Yeah, no, I know.

41:18.388 --> 41:21.304
All the sanction
has to say is,

41:21.304 --> 41:24.699
if anything happens to me,
he dies.

41:25.918 --> 41:27.441
That's it, Joe?

41:27.441 --> 41:29.138
And half
your dope profits.

41:29.138 --> 41:31.967
Fuck you, Colombo.
Go fuck yourself.

41:31.967 --> 41:35.884
I got your life in my hands, Tommy.

41:35.884 --> 41:40.498
Word gets out, you don't make it
past breakfast tomorrow.

41:40.498 --> 41:42.500
You motherfucker!

41:44.327 --> 41:46.982
One more thing.

41:46.982 --> 41:48.680
Part of the reason
for the hit

41:48.680 --> 41:51.770
was he thought I was fuckin'
his daughter, which I wasn't.

41:51.770 --> 41:54.816
But the other part
is that he thinks

41:54.816 --> 41:59.299
the dope puts me in position
to take over his territory.

41:59.299 --> 42:03.042
So I'm gonna prove him right.
I'm takin' Harlem.

42:13.748 --> 42:17.012
Elise. Malcolm.

42:17.883 --> 42:19.232
I need to speak with you immediately.

42:19.232 --> 42:20.538
It's of grave urgency.

42:22.888 --> 42:24.716
Can we please
clear the room?

42:32.985 --> 42:35.378
What did you want to say to us,
Brother Omar?

42:35.378 --> 42:38.468
I seem to recall you were
the one who gave me command

42:38.468 --> 42:41.384
of the Fruit of Islam,
with the blessing of Elijah.

42:41.384 --> 42:43.256
And there's a reason
for that.

42:45.388 --> 42:47.086
I was very thorough.

43:05.495 --> 43:07.933
I'm sure you remember
the office sweeps we did,

43:07.933 --> 43:09.587
Brother Minister.

43:11.850 --> 43:15.331
And the background checks
on any new members,

43:15.331 --> 43:17.507
once the cops started...

43:21.990 --> 43:23.949
planting their men.

43:36.570 --> 43:38.920
I heard about the NOI's
death threats against Malcolm,

43:38.920 --> 43:40.792
so I did
some investigating.

43:40.792 --> 43:44.099
We're well aware
of the NOI's ramblings, Omar.

43:44.099 --> 43:45.884
It's worse
than you think.

43:45.884 --> 43:47.755
What threats are you
talking about?

43:47.755 --> 43:50.279
I spoke
with Sister Marny,

43:50.279 --> 43:52.934
made her think
I was on her side.

43:52.934 --> 43:57.591
And she pointed me
to Mosque Number 25 in Newark,

43:57.591 --> 44:01.987
where Brother Clyde
and Sister Sondra

44:01.987 --> 44:05.860
are crafting
a plan to, uh--

44:05.860 --> 44:08.080
to kill you, Malcolm.

44:10.909 --> 44:13.172
Sister Sondra?

44:13.172 --> 44:15.478
From Mosque Number 7?

44:15.478 --> 44:18.003
Why are you
doing all this?

44:18.003 --> 44:19.787
Why risk your life?

44:19.787 --> 44:25.575
I wanted to redeem myself
through deed and not word.

44:25.575 --> 44:27.577
And I'm honored
to be of service.

44:34.062 --> 44:35.716
Goodbye, Malcolm.

44:40.025 --> 44:41.200
Goodbye, Elise.

44:44.420 --> 44:46.640
Hold on a moment,
Brother Omar.

44:49.643 --> 44:51.340
Are you certain?

44:51.340 --> 44:54.039
Yes, I am.

44:54.039 --> 44:58.696
I would be honored to serve
the MMI in any way that I can.

44:58.696 --> 45:00.698
I want you to be
my chief of security.

45:04.702 --> 45:06.573
That is,
only if Elise approves.

45:11.012 --> 45:12.231
He can stay.

45:18.193 --> 45:22.154
I must say, I'm surprised
to see you here, Mr. Johnson.

45:22.154 --> 45:23.851
So what?

45:23.851 --> 45:26.071
You just let your witnesses
get popped now?

45:26.071 --> 45:28.203
- No protection?
- Excuse me?

45:28.203 --> 45:31.032
You arrested Battle,
not me.

45:31.032 --> 45:33.034
It led to Archie Gaines'
murder.

45:33.034 --> 45:35.428
I have no idea who or what
you're talking about.

45:35.428 --> 45:39.040
The classified informant--
Archie Gaines!

45:39.040 --> 45:41.086
You left him wide-ass-open!

45:41.086 --> 45:44.742
I have no idea
who Archie Gaines is.

45:49.311 --> 45:54.795
And furthermore, I don't
discuss witnesses with anyone.

46:02.281 --> 46:04.805
You think this is
about gangsters in Harlem?

46:07.025 --> 46:11.769
Or-- Or-- Or your little
cocaine operation?

46:15.163 --> 46:17.078
Mr. Pike,
they're waiting for you

46:17.078 --> 46:19.037
in the United Nations
security meeting.

46:19.037 --> 46:21.213
I'm coming. Two seconds.

46:22.692 --> 46:24.259
Fuck this.

46:42.016 --> 46:44.062
You're a patsy.

46:44.062 --> 46:47.282
And there's a much bigger game
being played here.

46:49.458 --> 46:51.286
It's about the fate
of this country.

46:55.508 --> 46:57.249
Sorry,
that's all I'm gonna say.

47:04.952 --> 47:06.562
Mr. Johnson?

47:09.304 --> 47:10.523
Yeah.

47:17.747 --> 47:20.054
I'll be sad to see you go.

47:20.054 --> 47:21.751
I'll send you a postcard.

47:24.058 --> 47:25.451
Where you going?

47:25.451 --> 47:27.540
Just to Delia's in Philly.

47:28.846 --> 47:30.935
I got something for ya.

47:34.634 --> 47:36.201
Go on, open it.

47:49.170 --> 47:52.304
It's a first-class ticket
to Paris.

47:52.304 --> 47:56.569
I booked you the best hotel
for your first month.

47:56.569 --> 47:58.136
That's nice of you.

48:00.312 --> 48:05.143
Believe it or not,
I want you to be happy, Stella.

48:05.143 --> 48:05.883
I really do.

48:07.232 --> 48:09.234
What would make you happy?

48:11.801 --> 48:12.977
Honestly...

48:14.848 --> 48:16.502
if you didn't go.

48:19.635 --> 48:22.377
Being around you...

48:22.377 --> 48:26.773
has taught me
a lot of things.

48:26.773 --> 48:31.821
A lot of preconceived ideas
I've had about women

48:31.821 --> 48:35.782
and about this thing of ours,
about what's missing in my life.

48:35.782 --> 48:37.088
Joe.

48:37.088 --> 48:39.655
Uh, I ain't asking you
to marry me.

48:39.655 --> 48:41.309
I'm talkin' business.

48:43.485 --> 48:47.402
You're way smarter than all
of these bozos I work with.

48:48.882 --> 48:51.189
More capable.

48:51.189 --> 48:52.668
And don't take this
the wrong way,

48:52.668 --> 48:56.150
but pretty fuckin' ruthless
when you have to be.

48:57.586 --> 49:01.634
Now, see, I want you
to stay because...

49:01.634 --> 49:03.810
I think you can help me.

49:05.943 --> 49:07.509
And because I trust you.

49:10.338 --> 49:11.992
And I like you.

49:14.560 --> 49:16.257
You're crazy.

49:17.824 --> 49:21.523
Hmm, kinda be like my female
consigliere, you know?

49:23.003 --> 49:28.052
And in return,
I'll make you rich.

49:32.012 --> 49:35.363
Do you think that
this thing of yours

49:35.363 --> 49:37.191
has room for a woman?

49:37.191 --> 49:39.367
Not just any woman.

49:43.371 --> 49:45.373
Let's see how it goes.

49:45.373 --> 49:47.288
I can always leave, right?

49:47.288 --> 49:49.551
Yeah.

49:57.864 --> 49:59.953
So, I call Washington,

49:59.953 --> 50:02.303
and I say it's
a .50-caliber machine gun.

50:02.303 --> 50:05.350
They say, "Don't.
Just don't."

50:05.350 --> 50:07.917
Bumpy, join the party.

50:15.316 --> 50:17.231
Had a little chat with Pike.

50:17.231 --> 50:19.320
Yeah?

50:19.320 --> 50:20.669
What'd you learn?

50:20.669 --> 50:22.802
All roads lead to Malcolm.

50:25.196 --> 50:27.894
I'd be very careful, brother.

50:27.894 --> 50:29.417
You're playing with fire.

50:29.417 --> 50:32.290
The CIA and FBI
duking it out

50:32.290 --> 50:34.683
for who gets to
bring home the scalp.

50:34.683 --> 50:36.729
Throw in the NYPD
for good measure.

50:36.729 --> 50:38.339
What are you talkin' about?

50:38.339 --> 50:41.299
These clever fucks
fooled you, too, Jose.

50:41.299 --> 50:44.998
There was no rat, just the FBI
fuckin' with the CIA.

50:44.998 --> 50:47.261
They arrested you
just to slow down

50:47.261 --> 50:49.394
Harvey's momentum
on Malcolm.

50:49.394 --> 50:52.397
No rat, only a mole.

50:52.397 --> 50:55.487
A mole?
Fuck you. Where?

50:55.487 --> 50:58.925
I've been rolling it around
in my head.

50:58.925 --> 51:02.320
Who else had access
to our bank records?

51:02.320 --> 51:05.018
The mole is Conrad.

51:05.018 --> 51:07.542
He's feeding the FBI
your intel.

51:07.542 --> 51:09.936
- You son-of-a-bitch liar.
- It's bullshit.

51:09.936 --> 51:12.286
He offed Archie Gaines
to cover his tracks.

51:12.286 --> 51:14.332
Conrad is FBI.

51:14.332 --> 51:15.550
Fuck you!

51:15.550 --> 51:17.770
You want to sing,
or should I loosen you up

51:17.770 --> 51:18.771
with a shot to the knee?

51:18.771 --> 51:20.686
Okay, this is my guy.

51:20.686 --> 51:23.080
I'll be taking it
from here.

51:29.042 --> 51:31.610
Troy, listen to me.

51:31.610 --> 51:33.481
Guilty or not, no one's
shooting you, you understand?

51:33.481 --> 51:35.266
I should fucking
hope not.

51:35.266 --> 51:37.790
Now, look here,
if Johnson's right

51:37.790 --> 51:39.748
and our investigation
doesn't clear you,

51:39.748 --> 51:43.535
it'd be best for you
if you fessed up now.

51:43.535 --> 51:45.928
They go much easier
on truth tellers.

51:45.928 --> 51:48.583
Don't listen to
this son of a bitch.

51:48.583 --> 51:50.977
I would never
fucking betray you.

51:50.977 --> 51:54.328
Conrad,
I've known you a year.

51:54.328 --> 51:59.333
I was at your kid's baptism.
You need to be straight with me.

51:59.333 --> 52:01.988
I'm not FBI.

52:13.913 --> 52:17.699
Maybe you're right,
maybe you're wrong.

52:17.699 --> 52:19.353
I don't leave loose ends.

52:21.399 --> 52:25.446
The great "Wild Bill" went
a year without smellin' a rat.

52:25.446 --> 52:26.882
It's a big boy's game.

52:28.884 --> 52:30.756
Shit happens.

52:30.756 --> 52:32.236
Yeah, you're right.

52:34.455 --> 52:36.544
I should've smelled a rat
sooner myself.

52:38.807 --> 52:40.069
What?

52:40.069 --> 52:41.723
You were the only one I told

52:41.723 --> 52:45.379
about Malcolm speaking with Che
at the United Nations.

52:45.379 --> 52:47.468
How would Pike know that?

52:47.468 --> 52:50.079
From his mole
Conrad here.

52:50.079 --> 52:52.691
And his mole
got it from you.

52:54.214 --> 52:56.999
Do you understand
what your friend is doing?

52:58.610 --> 53:00.089
Partnering
with Che Guevara,

53:00.089 --> 53:01.874
a man who wants to have
communist revolutions

53:01.874 --> 53:03.702
all over the world.

53:03.702 --> 53:05.530
Bumpy, you got to realize,
the buddy-buddy shit

53:05.530 --> 53:08.489
with this Malcolm character
is gonna destroy your business,

53:08.489 --> 53:10.665
if not your life.

53:11.579 --> 53:14.103
Remember, Bill,
if I get touched,

53:14.103 --> 53:16.236
Operation Mongoose
goes public.

53:20.588 --> 53:23.200
I'm sorry, brother.

53:23.200 --> 53:25.158
I don't trust you anymore.

53:25.158 --> 53:27.465
This partnership
is over.

54:08.593 --> 54:10.072
What's that?

54:32.704 --> 54:36.838
<i>♪ I wish somebody</i>

54:36.838 --> 54:38.449
<i>♪ Would come and ease</i>

54:38.449 --> 54:47.893
<i>♪ My troublin' mind, yeah</i>

54:47.893 --> 54:52.071
<i>♪ I wish somebody</i>

54:52.071 --> 54:59.208

54:59.208 --> 55:01.950

55:07.216 --> 55:13.919
