- Hello '?
- Ma-may I speak with Gemma '?

01:57.760 --> 02:02.231
- This is Gemma.
- Gemma '? Gemma, is that really you '?

02:03.400 --> 02:07.473

- Yes, Gemma. It's me.

02:08.039 --> 02:11.635

02:14.120 --> 02:17.112
Who called so early this morning '?

02:18.040 --> 02:19.951
Gojko.

02:20.400 --> 02:22.311
From Sarajevo.

02:32.240 --> 02:35.710
He's been trying to reach me
for months, through the Embassy.

02:35.800 --> 02:38.952
They're organizing a show,
to commemorate the Siege.

02:39.040 --> 02:41.236
He asked me to go.

02:41.680 --> 02:44.354
Some of Diego's photos will be in it.

02:58.880 --> 03:02.316
I have to go to the office,
I have a ton of work to do.

03:02.880 --> 03:04.996
I can't just leave like this.

03:07.000 --> 03:08.991
I don't know...

03:13.840 --> 03:15.831
Of course you know.

03:19.960 --> 03:23.919
Pietro will never come with me.

03:26.360 --> 03:28.749
But it's a chance for him too.

03:33.880 --> 03:35.871
Here.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.798
Gojko!

03:42.560 --> 03:46.440
- He's still alive.
- He's always been alive.

04:09.000 --> 04:10.991
Mom.

04:11.760 --> 04:13.751
Let's go, Mom.

04:18.480 --> 04:20.471
Pietro I

04:31.560 --> 04:35.554
- Beautiful woman !
- Old woman. - Fuck off !

04:48.480 --> 04:52.678
- You are a rocker.
- I'm a joker.

05:37.280 --> 05:40.671
You liked it '?
- Very much.

05:42.360 --> 05:46.877
- Is there any ice cream '?
- Yeah there is a corner.

05:46.960 --> 05:50.078
How do you say "ice cream"
in Bosnia '? - "Sladoled".

05:50.160 --> 05:53.437
- Chokolada, vanila... - If I just
say ice cream will they understand me'?

05:53.520 --> 05:56.831
Ok. Can I have some money,
please '?

05:56.920 --> 06:00.276
- Wait. Here.

06:00.360 --> 06:04.319
Thank you !

06:09.720 --> 06:13.509
- He's a good kid.
- He's like his father.

06:23.120 --> 06:26.670
Call me, Gemma, any time.

06:27.120 --> 06:29.509
I sleep sitting up...

06:31.160 --> 06:35.631
because if I'm lying down I can feel
my heart in my eyes.

06:37.280 --> 06:42.639
It was easier to run through the
grenades that to walking on ruins.

06:45.320 --> 06:47.311
<i>Gemma '7?</i>

06:49.440 --> 06:52.558
I'm Gojko, your guide.

06:53.480 --> 06:58.316
So, you're doing some research on...
Oh, on Andric.

06:59.640 --> 07:01.756
Yes, for my thesis.

07:02.320 --> 07:07.030
- So, do you have a good place to
stay '? - Yes, a guesthouse. I'm fine.

07:07.120 --> 07:10.715
Don't worry because you could sleep
under a bridge on the Miljacka,

07:10.800 --> 07:12.837
nobody would bother you.

07:12.920 --> 07:15.673
There's not a drunk or thief to be
found these days, you know.

07:15.760 --> 07:18.559
Communist cleanup.

07:19.080 --> 07:23.358
This <i>is</i> the first time we are baring
our ass to the world.

07:26.640 --> 07:30.076
Please.

07:30.160 --> 07:33.118
Olympic Games are about to start

07:33.200 --> 07:37.353
and we have no snow, so,
I'm a little bit worrying.

07:38.280 --> 07:43.559
- Look, I'm here to study Andric <i>s</i>
work. - Ah...

07:43.640 --> 07:48.555
I need someone who can take me to
places related to his life in Bosnia.

07:49.360 --> 07:51.749
Maybe you're not the right person.

07:51.840 --> 07:55.276
I have a car I

08:03.200 --> 08:07.512
- What are you doing '?
- No, no, no. Don't worry.

08:07.600 --> 08:11.275
It's German. The Germans do their
assembly work here, they trust us.

08:11.360 --> 08:15.399
And you want to know why'?
Because we are so precise.

08:17.480 --> 08:21.075
Okay, so maybe we are not so precise
but we sure are cheap.

08:21.920 --> 08:23.911
I pay you very well.

08:25.200 --> 08:27.191
You must be a real whore.

08:28.160 --> 08:31.152
- What '?
- You must be a real whore.

08:32.120 --> 08:35.192
Stop. Stop the car I

08:40.559 --> 08:44.394
What the fuck are you trying to teach
me '? What are you, Italian professor?

08:44.480 --> 08:47.632
Poetry is the art
that listens to human life.

08:47.920 --> 08:50.912
She's crazy I

08:51.040 --> 08:55.398
Poetry... Poetry is God when he feels
nostalgia for men.

08:56.320 --> 08:58.960
It's difficult to translate poetry.

08:59.720 --> 09:03.076
'Alum mo. I

09:03.160 --> 09:05.515
a fist-full of earth falling,
as the gravedigger swears, spits."

09:06.920 --> 09:08.877
Please Gemma, get in.

09:08.960 --> 09:12.032
It's not my car, a friend lent it
to me. I give him half my pay.

09:12.120 --> 09:15.112
Please, please get in,
enough of this.

09:26.400 --> 09:28.835
You bring good luck.

09:29.600 --> 09:31.591
Beautiful Italian woman I

09:32.920 --> 09:35.673
What was the poem about'?

09:35.760 --> 09:38.957
A gravedigger.
He has to bury a poet,

09:39.040 --> 09:41.839
and he curses and smokes
on his grave.

09:42.240 --> 09:46.632
- And spits.
- Yes... yes and spits

09:46.720 --> 09:48.472
I understood something.

09:48.560 --> 09:51.313
It's pronounced just like
it's written,

09:51.400 --> 09:54.552
and the words agree
with others close to them.

09:54.640 --> 09:58.395
For example, if there is a feminine
noun, everything else becomes feminine.

09:58.480 --> 10:00.869
We are very gallant, you know '?

10:10.760 --> 10:12.751
You got married '?

10:14.560 --> 10:17.757
- Yeah.
- Tell me, what is she like '?

10:18.920 --> 10:21.116
I was lucky.

10:29.560 --> 10:33.349
What about the house in Monte
Trebevic'? Is it still there '?

10:34.760 --> 10:36.990
It's covered with mines but...

10:37.680 --> 10:43.073
if you want we can go up there
together and get blown up.

10:51.200 --> 10:54.989
Guys, guys !
Your attention, please.

10:55.080 --> 10:58.152
Let me introduce my Italian friend.

10:58.240 --> 11:01.790
Gemma, this is Zoran, a great mime.
Also known as Kafka.

11:01.880 --> 11:05.589
His father, our local philosopher,
also known as Kant.

11:05.680 --> 11:09.071
This is Bojan, our amazing
saxophone player.

11:09.160 --> 11:12.994
Come on here. Let me introduce to
my Italian friend,

11:13.080 --> 11:17.039
this is Diego, photographer,
American friend. Diego.

11:17.120 --> 11:19.475
“Unequal

11:20.240 --> 11:24.791
This is Mladio, a great sculptor
and he's the craziest of us.

11:24.880 --> 11:27.110
The great actress Ana

11:27.200 --> 11:30.431
A woman everybody wants
and many have had.

11:38.480 --> 11:41.598
I spent the whole day lying in the
snow with skiers jumping over me,

11:41.680 --> 11:44.638
ice chips flying in my eyes.

11:44.720 --> 11:47.712
I'm probably going to go blind. It's
not a great idea for a photographer

11:47.800 --> 11:50.792
But I don't understand why you didn't
wear sunglasses.

11:50.880 --> 11:54.191
Dammit!

11:54.280 --> 11:57.318
No, that's like making love
with your clothes on.

11:57.400 --> 12:00.199
Nothing can come between you
and the lens.

12:02.520 --> 12:04.511
Here.

12:06.080 --> 12:09.835
God that laugh.

12:14.280 --> 12:18.956
- Are you seeing someone '?
- I have been someone for many years.

12:21.840 --> 12:24.639
- What about you '?
- Me '?

12:25.600 --> 12:30.549
I'm free I

12:30.640 --> 12:34.634
I'm free !
Drop everything and run away with me.

12:35.600 --> 12:38.797
Mmhm, where to '?

12:38.880 --> 12:43.716
Brasil. Photograph children
who work in these mines in Camaru.

12:43.800 --> 12:45.791
I was going to leave tomorrow.

12:46.400 --> 12:49.836
I was so happy,
but now I'm so sad.

12:52.600 --> 12:54.796
I'm also leaving tomorrow.

14:34.720 --> 14:38.076
- Excuse me, Mirna Mari '?
- Room 13.

14:40.800 --> 14:42.791
"Mama" '?

14:44.360 --> 14:46.271
"Mama..."

14:46.360 --> 14:48.590
May I take her '?

14:50.040 --> 14:51.997
Be careful with her head.

14:57.520 --> 15:00.672
Allow me to introduce myself,
young lady.

15:00.760 --> 15:05.391
I'm your brother, Gojko.
And I'll also be your father,

15:05.480 --> 15:08.836
in the memory of our recently
departed dad.

15:10.720 --> 15:12.472
What is it '?

15:12.560 --> 15:15.518
My mother wants to thank you
for giving me work.

15:15.600 --> 15:18.592
Very good.

15:19.960 --> 15:22.759
She asked if you'd like to hold
the baby.

15:27.600 --> 15:29.591
Oh, she is so sweet.

15:34.320 --> 15:38.951
So small.

15:48.800 --> 15:50.791
Do you want children'?

15:52.560 --> 15:54.551
Now"?

15:55.440 --> 15:57.750
It's all I want.

15:59.720 --> 16:03.190
Come on, Come on,
Welcome to my house.

16:05.840 --> 16:09.071
Principessa italiana can sleep here.

16:09.160 --> 16:12.118
You, photographer
you will sleep in my room.

16:12.200 --> 16:16.398
Don't worry, sheets are clean enough,
and I'll sleep on the couch.

16:23.560 --> 16:26.871
- Tell me.
- Our poet has fallen asleep.

16:30.960 --> 16:35.033
- Okay, good night.
- No, I'm in love with you.

16:35.120 --> 16:39.353
- You are crazy. - I, I want to spend
the rest of my life with you.

16:39.440 --> 16:42.796
- Okay. How old are you '?
- Twenty-three.

16:42.880 --> 16:46.794
OWN-Obi

16:48.200 --> 16:50.396
Nice poem, Gojko, congratulations.

16:51.000 --> 16:54.038
Alana.

17:05.599 --> 17:07.590
No!Go!

17:35.360 --> 17:37.351
Oh God I

17:52.400 --> 17:54.516
And now you're mine.

18:03.920 --> 18:05.911
Till!!!"-

18:16.880 --> 18:20.794
There's a trattoria nearby,
I used to bring you mother there.

18:20.880 --> 18:22.871
They make such a carbonara...

18:23.440 --> 18:25.590
Let's run away.

18:25.680 --> 18:28.752
I'm happy, Dad I I'm convinced.

18:28.840 --> 18:32.117
And the other one, the American '?
The night caller '?

18:32.200 --> 18:37.115
- There's no one else.
- Then... no carbonara.

18:38.320 --> 18:41.073
' <i>Mum.</i>

19:56.360 --> 20:02.709
- You're crazy, crazy. - I told you
I'd be in Rome in no time.

20:02.800 --> 20:06.031
You cannot stay here. This is my
father's house. I just got divorced.

20:06.120 --> 20:07.997
Yes I

20:08.080 --> 20:11.755
That's okay. I can take care of myself
I already got a place to stay anyway.

20:14.880 --> 20:18.236
- Armando '?
- Diego ! How was your trip, Diego '?

20:18.320 --> 20:21.073
Oh, it was great !
I took your advice.

20:21.160 --> 20:25.199
- I followed a road, the...
- Aurelia ! - Aureelia, yeah.

20:25.920 --> 20:28.434
I got a present for you.

20:29.640 --> 20:35.272
It's from my childhood,
from when I was a baby.

20:38.680 --> 20:42.355
Hey, look, I haven't changed a bit,
it still fits.

20:42.440 --> 20:44.829
My ass is the same size.

20:46.240 --> 20:48.231
You happy to see me '?

20:48.880 --> 20:51.474
Yes '? Maybe '?
Maybe just a little bit '?

20:56.200 --> 21:01.559

21:01.640 --> 21:05.520

-Yeah, yeah. I'm a photographer.

Eh, you work in weddings,
advertising '?

21:11.120 --> 21:15.114
- Puddles mostly.
- Puddles. Yeah.

21:16.240 --> 21:18.277
- Interesting, eh '?

21:18.360 --> 21:22.149
May I have the honor of taking your
daughter off to dinner tonight'?

21:22.240 --> 21:24.880
Of course, Diego.

21:35.760 --> 21:41.756
WWII
WWII

21:41.840 --> 21:43.956
But do you think I really want
to live here'?

21:44.040 --> 21:47.431
No, it belongs to a friend,
a guy I met in Brazil.

21:51.320 --> 21:53.311
This way.

21:55.080 --> 21:57.310
All for you my love.

21:58.760 --> 22:00.751
Come on.

22:02.320 --> 22:04.834
What perfume are you wearing '?

22:05.400 --> 22:07.550
Juniper shower gel.

22:11.240 --> 22:13.231
Sit.

22:15.760 --> 22:18.718
Sorry, I forgot
my dress shirts at home.

22:18.800 --> 22:23.397
- These are cemetery candles. - It's
all they had at the supermarket.

22:29.720 --> 22:34.874
- When did you take these photos '?
- Did you forget '?

22:35.640 --> 22:38.393
Have you thought about what
to do for a living '?

22:38.480 --> 22:42.360
There's lots of little old ladies that
need a nice portrait for tombstone.

22:43.200 --> 22:46.431
- That won't take us very far.
- No, but we're already here.

22:47.560 --> 22:51.519
Everyday will be a party with me baby.
I promise.

22:55.320 --> 22:57.630
How can you always be so happy '?

22:57.720 --> 23:00.917
I can't stand being sad.

24:22.360 --> 24:24.351
I love you Gemma.

24:34.480 --> 24:37.552
- The night at Gojkds house '?
- Yeah.

24:38.720 --> 24:41.109
I got pregnant.

24:41.600 --> 24:45.798
Jesus Christ, Gemma.
And you didn't even tell me'?

24:50.760 --> 24:56.836
I lost it immediately.
It never even had a heartbeat.

24:56.920 --> 25:01.517
It was lifeless,
like a blind eye.

25:02.280 --> 25:06.160
My grandmother was blind.
She was a schoolteacher.

25:07.160 --> 25:11.836
One day she was riding her bike
and she fell in the river.

25:12.560 --> 25:14.949
My grandfather fished her out.

25:16.240 --> 25:21.918
He was younger than her, and they spent
the rest of their lives together.

25:26.800 --> 25:30.077
The weirdest love stories
are always the best.

25:43.880 --> 25:48.272
This, right here,
this is the spot you know.

25:49.480 --> 25:54.429
This is where everything comes from,
where everything's born.

25:56.800 --> 25:59.076
It's our destiny, you know.
The river of life

26:00.120 --> 26:02.111
The river of life.

26:10.000 --> 26:14.551
You want to know the truth '?
He looks like you

26:14.640 --> 26:18.998
He walks like you
and he's moody like you.

26:22.120 --> 26:26.796
- Did I ever tell you how much I was
in love with you'? - You never did.

26:26.880 --> 26:29.269
But you two were so in love.

26:31.640 --> 26:34.234
You were so in love with him.

27:55.040 --> 27:58.032
Pietro, be careful I

28:06.760 --> 28:08.751
Is this Diego's '?

28:10.160 --> 28:14.119
It's nice !
It looks like a cool CD cover.

28:15.000 --> 28:19.312
- No, I don't think it's your dad's.
- Dad '?

28:19.400 --> 28:21.835
What a drag with this story I

28:26.640 --> 28:32.079
The first photo of your son.
Sorry you could not take it yourself.

28:32.160 --> 28:34.151
Pietro I

28:36.120 --> 28:39.636
- I love him already.
- Diego, we have no money.

28:39.720 --> 28:44.237
No,no,no!
Today I got paid.

28:47.040 --> 28:49.998
You can't ride a motor scooter anymore.

28:50.080 --> 28:54.756
And you... You have to listen
to Mozar, Beethoven, Bach !

28:56.800 --> 28:59.792
Pink Floyd. No I
Pink Floyd. No I

29:05.280 --> 29:08.557
You're a mother now, a temple

29:13.400 --> 29:17.359
and I'm a monk
who kneels before you.

29:26.920 --> 29:30.800
Come on, son, faster.
Time for a new life.

29:30.880 --> 29:34.271
You need to take care
of your body now.

29:34.360 --> 29:38.957
No more alcohol, no more cigarettes
and no more pot.

29:39.560 --> 29:42.473
Enough!

29:43.000 --> 29:46.118
- Italian Fascist !
- Shut up !

29:46.200 --> 29:49.238
A spineless American,
that's what you are I

29:49.320 --> 29:53.553
- There, smoke, smoke ! - How did you
manage to win all those wars '?

30:00.680 --> 30:03.035
Shit I

31:12.480 --> 31:16.758
it was a blighted ovum,
the body expels them naturally.

31:16.840 --> 31:18.831
You were lucky.

31:19.480 --> 31:22.677
The hemorrhage saved you from a D&C.

31:26.680 --> 31:28.671
What did he say '?

31:29.880 --> 31:32.394
He said I was lucky.

31:32.480 --> 31:35.074
Just means it wasn't Pietro, sweetie.

31:38.160 --> 31:43.951
The children who are meant to come,
will come. Gemma, they'll come.

31:50.800 --> 31:54.953
Look ! Oh, get some fresh air in here.
Look, this is our bedroom.

31:55.040 --> 31:56.951
Really sweet, look.

31:57.040 --> 32:01.637
Oh, and a dark room, a perfect dark
room or maybe even a nursery.

32:01.720 --> 32:05.315
Got a music room or maybe
even a dance hall.

32:05.400 --> 32:08.597
God, so much space, so spacious,
the windows.

32:12.760 --> 32:16.549
Look over here too.
Slip and slide.

32:17.520 --> 32:19.636
Behind you is the kitchen.

32:24.880 --> 32:27.076
It's our new life, Gemma

32:28.520 --> 32:30.511
My love.

32:33.920 --> 32:37.993
I'll be right here honey I'm not going
anywhere 0k '? Think about me !

32:38.080 --> 32:41.994
Think about us 0k '?
I love you Gemma, I love you.

32:42.080 --> 32:45.596
You're my sparkling Gemma
little flower bud !

32:45.680 --> 32:49.594
WWII

32:49.680 --> 32:52.877
- I'll make it this time!
- Good morning, Gemma.

32:58.680 --> 33:01.638
Don't worry, Gemma,
relax

33:01.720 --> 33:05.509
and think about something
beautiful, think about the sea.

33:32.200 --> 33:36.159
I'm so sorry I'm late there was
so much fucking traffic.

33:36.240 --> 33:38.038
Beautiful.

33:39.040 --> 33:44.035
Sally.

33:47.960 --> 33:52.113
I'm afraid that your eggs are
incompatible with life.

33:52.200 --> 33:54.794
Your sterility factor is rated at 97%.

33:55.760 --> 34:00.311
We consider that total sterility.

34:04.920 --> 34:06.911
What about the 3% '?

34:08.239 --> 34:10.389
Miracles I

34:10.480 --> 34:14.838
Miracles do happen.
This is Italy after all.

34:16.760 --> 34:19.797
You can live also without children,
Gemma.

34:31.120 --> 34:37.036
Adoption is a lengthy process,
a real ordeal for the mind and soul.

34:37.120 --> 34:40.590
The last test of your shortcomings.

34:40.679 --> 34:44.674
As your psychologist
my responsibility

34:47.080 --> 34:49.275
is to discourage you.

34:52.760 --> 34:57.550
Having a child has become
an obsession.

34:57.640 --> 35:00.314
I see pregnant women everywhere,

35:00.400 --> 35:03.836
They are like an army walking
towards me.

35:04.720 --> 35:06.677
Do you really want me to be honest '?

35:06.760 --> 35:11.231
I'm not here to prove to you
that I am a good person.

35:11.320 --> 35:14.312
I'm here because I'm afraid.

35:15.240 --> 35:18.517
I'm afraid of losing the man I love.

35:19.680 --> 35:25.278
I want to give him a child
to tie him to me

35:25.760 --> 35:27.956
with this padlock of flesh.

35:28.520 --> 35:31.034
What does truth taste like'?

35:31.920 --> 35:33.911
Awful.

35:38.720 --> 35:40.711
Better.

35:41.080 --> 35:45.631
When my father beat my mother
I'd go hide in the closet.

35:45.720 --> 35:49.918
I'd just keep telling myself
"Think about something beautiful".

35:50.000 --> 35:52.150
I'd piss in my pants.

35:53.080 --> 35:56.789
But I wouldn't come off until
I heard my mother washing her face

35:56.880 --> 35:59.759
and going into the kitchen
and start frying eggs.

35:59.840 --> 36:03.754
And then I'd come off and smile
as if to say,

36:03.840 --> 36:11.270
"it's 0k ma'. I didn't hear a thing,
all I saw was a beautiful thing".

36:15.000 --> 36:18.072
When my father died,

36:18.160 --> 36:22.916
when they lifted up the container
there wasn't really anything

36:23.000 --> 36:27.119
it was just a puddle of shrimp
marmalade and my father floating in it.

36:29.800 --> 36:32.838
That was when I took
my first photograph.

36:34.960 --> 36:37.600
And then I started using heroine.

36:38.840 --> 36:42.834
Heroine was a beautiful thing, it was
a thing that took away all the pain.

36:43.520 --> 36:46.717
All of a sudden soccer fields
seemed like the Maracanã stadium

36:46.800 --> 36:50.555
and my ugly mug didn't seem so bad.

36:52.560 --> 36:54.949
And then I met Gemma.

36:56.120 --> 37:00.512
The only, truly beautiful thing
in my life.

37:02.280 --> 37:07.036
I want a child with his eyes,
with his neck.

37:08.760 --> 37:11.354
Do you think there is a child like
that somewhere'?

37:11.440 --> 37:14.512
The police has given a negative
evaluation.

37:15.840 --> 37:20.437
Your criminal record Diego,
the drugs and all the rest,

37:20.520 --> 37:23.080
there was nothing I could do.

37:23.160 --> 37:26.357
Your request has been refused.

37:27.360 --> 37:29.351
I'm sorry.

37:30.040 --> 37:33.749
I'm just...
I'm so sorry.

37:36.760 --> 37:40.310
It couldn't have happened to a more
deserving couple.

37:53.520 --> 37:57.115
Hey, how are you'? Are you 0k '?
What do you need '?

37:57.200 --> 38:00.192
A case of Brunello di Montalcino.

38:01.040 --> 38:04.556
- Gojko, senti, how are you,
how is Sebina'?

38:04.640 --> 38:07.837
Ah, Sebina <i>is</i> fine, <i>she's</i> always
jumping all over the place.

38:07.920 --> 38:10.639
Listen put her on a plane,
send her to us.

38:10.720 --> 38:13.519
No, no, relax, there is no war here.

38:13.600 --> 38:16.353
No one will ever touch Sarajevo.

38:20.560 --> 38:23.313
Did you like the photos '?

38:25.920 --> 38:28.309
Were you there '?
Were you always with him '?

38:29.480 --> 38:31.471
Not always.

38:33.440 --> 38:36.956
- And where was I '?
- You weren't born yet.

38:37.560 --> 38:41.554
- Weren't you scared '?
- Of what '?

38:41.640 --> 38:45.759
You were pregnant. Weren't you scared
of being pregnant in a war '?

38:49.600 --> 38:53.798
My shoes are wet !
I've caught a cold.

38:56.840 --> 38:59.753
Legs up I Shake them fast.

39:08.600 --> 39:12.195
Make the lights flicker.

39:12.600 --> 39:14.591
Let's change position, the other way.

39:16.560 --> 39:19.552
Fast, fast I

39:30.840 --> 39:34.151
One day you'll find somebody
with good ovaries,

39:34.240 --> 39:38.473
someone young and healthy
and you'll have a child with her.

39:38.560 --> 39:40.517
What the fuck are you talking about'?

39:40.600 --> 39:43.911
I'll bring you little presents,
I'll play the aunt.

39:48.440 --> 39:50.431
Shoes with lights...

39:58.880 --> 40:02.350
And I'll forgive you
because I care for you too much.

40:02.440 --> 40:06.798
Well, I don't "care" for you too much,
I love you.

40:09.200 --> 40:12.158
We have to learn to live
without children.

40:12.240 --> 40:15.870
- It's easy for you to say.
- No. It's not.

40:15.960 --> 40:20.397
Diego you can have a child whenever
you want, with whoever you want.

40:20.480 --> 40:23.711
Fine I'll get spade, like a cat.

40:23.800 --> 40:27.555
I don't know what the fuck to do
with my balls anymore anyway.

40:28.960 --> 40:32.078
I mean I'm sick of earning money
for nothing.

40:32.160 --> 40:35.118
I'm of no use to you any more,
I don't know how to make you happy.

40:58.440 --> 41:00.829
Are you fucking the stylist?

41:03.600 --> 41:07.434
Maybe we should split up.

41:14.200 --> 41:17.079
- Bye kids !
- Bye !

41:42.640 --> 41:46.429
So it's true that,
life speaks through light.

41:49.400 --> 41:51.789
You know who we'll take these to '?

42:10.600 --> 42:14.150
So guys.
This is the radio station.

42:14.240 --> 42:16.709
I do a night poetry show.

42:18.000 --> 42:20.196
I fuck like a mule these days.

42:20.680 --> 42:25.516
- Hey. Kafka! (off) What's up!
- Diego, I have something for you !

42:25.600 --> 42:28.672
Hello Ana.

42:28.760 --> 42:31.832
It's our communal house.

42:32.120 --> 42:35.112
Come on, what did you cook
for my friends, mama'?

42:35.320 --> 42:38.073
My mom is the great cook!

42:38.160 --> 42:40.595
It's plenty of electricity, you know.

43:03.000 --> 43:04.991
You're wonderful I

43:06.760 --> 43:08.751
Beautiful, Sebina.

43:09.640 --> 43:12.837
This way we will always be able
to find you,

43:13.640 --> 43:15.631
even in the dark.

43:16.320 --> 43:18.675
She is not studying at all, she is all
the time training at the gym.

43:18.760 --> 43:23.277
She wants to become
next Nadia Comaneci.

43:34.920 --> 43:38.595
Son of a bitch I Do I always have
to listen to him '? Turn it off!

43:38.680 --> 43:41.752
How can every anyone be afraid
of an ass like him '?

43:41.840 --> 43:43.797
It's the assholes you have
to be afraid of.

43:43.880 --> 43:46.998
He changed the menus in the
restaurants the street names!

43:47.080 --> 43:51.153
For them it's enough to fart and they
think their ass in supporting them.

43:51.240 --> 43:55.279
Yeah, the propaganda people, first
come propaganda and then history.

43:55.360 --> 43:59.069
No, it's one thing to... convince
a peasant that his Turkish neighbor

43:59.160 --> 44:02.118
wants to cut his throat,

44:02.200 --> 44:05.750
but there aren't any Turks here
or Cetnics, or Ustascia.

44:05.840 --> 44:10.437
Yeah that's what I'm talking about,
because here we are all Sarajevans !

44:10.520 --> 44:15.230
- Poets, artists, lawyers.
- Wars start in the villages.

44:16.040 --> 44:18.350
- Wars start in the soccer stadiums,

44:18.440 --> 44:22.559
while you guys haul yourselves up
in artist's colonies and write poetry.

44:24.200 --> 44:28.512
- But you're not scared '?
- We are together.

44:28.600 --> 44:31.592
That's what matters.
Ah, ja.

44:36.200 --> 44:38.191
What is the smell like '?

44:39.080 --> 44:41.071
Milk.

44:41.480 --> 44:43.835
Or the forest.

44:44.840 --> 44:49.311
They are both biologists, he is
professor, she was his assistant.

44:49.400 --> 44:53.234
They rent off a room and he's a jew,
she's a muslim

44:53.320 --> 44:55.436
but don't worry you'll be comfortable.

44:55.520 --> 44:59.753
Welcome. Please take off your shoes.

45:09.120 --> 45:13.398
Good morning.
Do you have international newspapers '?

45:13.480 --> 45:15.915
Newspaper '? Yes !

45:17.040 --> 45:19.793
Thank you. "Le Monde".

45:19.880 --> 45:23.032
How are you, Professor '?

45:27.760 --> 45:30.752
And when are you two going
to have a baby

45:32.320 --> 45:34.630
Come on, the yankee can't '?

45:35.360 --> 45:39.672
If you need a little help, c'mon,
here I am.

45:47.200 --> 45:49.476
I'm sterile, Gojko.

45:54.320 --> 45:56.311
Sterile.

46:01.520 --> 46:03.511
Beautiful woman...

46:03.920 --> 46:06.480
We are a luckless generation.

46:14.880 --> 46:17.599
I wanted a child with these feet.

46:19.720 --> 46:23.270
I wanted to see him walking in front
of us.

46:25.800 --> 46:27.791
I lost.

46:37.920 --> 46:42.118
- Why don't you come too '?
- Do you like her '? - No.

46:44.200 --> 46:46.794
I like Italian girls!

46:46.880 --> 46:51.556
- Let's go, Pietro.
- Come on. - Go, go.

46:51.640 --> 46:55.235
Leave her alone, we will have fun,
the three of us. Let's go.

46:55.520 --> 46:57.238
Be careful on the slides I

46:57.320 --> 46:59.072
Be careful I

46:59.160 --> 47:00.719
MW!

47:00.800 --> 47:02.598
You be careful too.

48:59.560 --> 49:03.838
- Who's that girl '? - Kurt Kobain.
- Kurt Kobain '?

49:03.920 --> 49:06.196
And who the heck is that '?

49:08.080 --> 49:12.153
- Do you like Nirvana'? I listen
to them in the dark every night.

49:12.240 --> 49:15.232
They blow me away.

49:15.320 --> 49:19.598
- Where exactly do they blow you to '?
- Somewhere you'll never go.

49:20.080 --> 49:23.277
- Idiot !
- Fuck you!

49:23.360 --> 49:27.672
Nirvana is just a bunch of fucking
nihilist millionaires.

49:27.760 --> 49:30.274
- Screw you !
- Shut up !

49:34.640 --> 49:36.995
So what are your intentions, Aska?

49:37.840 --> 49:41.310
To play music.
One of the guys in Nirvana is Croatian.

49:41.400 --> 49:44.631
If he made it, so can I.

49:44.720 --> 49:47.109
I want to go to London.

49:47.600 --> 49:49.591
That's why I need the money.

49:54.240 --> 49:56.117
Gojko told me

49:56.200 --> 49:59.750
you are looking for a roda, a stork.

50:05.000 --> 50:07.674
I want to be paid in deutsche marks.

50:08.640 --> 50:12.713
- Will you do it only for money '?
- What do you want me to say '?

50:13.080 --> 50:16.471
That I'm doing it for love '?

50:19.160 --> 50:22.596
- Are you muslim '?
- Sometimes I read the Koran.

50:22.680 --> 50:29.120
And what does the Koran say '? You can
rent your body to another woman '?

50:29.200 --> 50:32.830
The Koran says to help other people

50:33.480 --> 50:37.314
I'm happy to help a woman
who's defective.

50:37.400 --> 50:39.516
We all have to give something back.

50:58.440 --> 51:03.071
If you think about it, even the Virgin
Mary lent her womb to God the Father.

51:04.160 --> 51:08.040
Aska doesn't exactly strike
my as the Virgin Mary.

51:19.040 --> 51:23.477
Every once in a while God points
his finger at someone and says

51:23.560 --> 51:26.200
"You, come with me."

51:26.280 --> 51:28.271
You can't say no to God.

51:28.360 --> 51:32.149
He plants himself inside of us,
opens our soul.

51:32.240 --> 51:35.471
Kurt Kobain does drugs
so he can deal with God.

51:39.760 --> 51:44.152
How can I be sure you,
you won't decide to keep the baby '?

51:44.840 --> 51:48.754
Easy. Families make me sick.

51:52.280 --> 51:54.476
Downhill"

52:02.120 --> 52:06.318
My test results.
No, I don't have AIDS.

52:10.480 --> 52:12.278
Hi.

52:18.080 --> 52:20.913
My boyfriend and I can't have
intercourse,

52:21.000 --> 52:26.029
I have these bad muscle spasms so,
it's basically impossible, you know.

52:26.120 --> 52:29.590
- Muscle spasms.
- Artificial insemination.

52:29.680 --> 52:32.035
Yeah, that. Whatever you call it.

52:32.120 --> 52:38.150
We have to do some tests first
in order to monitor your ovulation

52:38.240 --> 52:42.871
and then your partner
will have to...

52:45.920 --> 52:47.877
Doctor...

She's not going to come.

56:36.160 --> 56:37.753
Good morning.

I don't know if you remember,
I was here with my husband,

56:43.000 --> 56:44.991
before the war,

56:46.280 --> 56:48.271
he was a photographer.

56:48.600 --> 56:51.592
A lot of photographers came here I

Sorry I'm late.
It's a zoo off there

57:30.720 --> 57:33.872
with the demonstrations and all.

57:34.680 --> 57:37.672
Let's hope I still have
a few eggs left.

Are you staying '?

57:45.480 --> 57:47.278

So are they fucking those two '?

58:18.760 --> 58:23.357
"And the life laughs at us
like a toothless old whore

58:23.440 --> 58:26.239
while we fuck her
with our eyes closed,

58:26.320 --> 58:29.278
dreaming of the ass of lilly."

58:33.800 --> 58:35.791
Do I stink '?

58:41.880 --> 58:43.678
No.

58:44.120 --> 58:46.111
You smell good.

58:55.960 --> 58:59.669
Let's go make love
once before we die.

59:17.520 --> 59:19.909
We're not going to die, Gojko.

59:29.720 --> 59:34.112

59:50.040 --> 59:53.510

You were alone all day !
All day !

Give me the lotion,
I'm all sunburned.

01:00:22.120 --> 01:00:24.191
Look for it yourself.

01:00:25.960 --> 01:00:28.998
What did you do to your feet '?
They're filthy !

01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:33.316
- You hurt me, Pietro.

Yeah, who do you think you are '?

01:00:41.160 --> 01:00:43.117
You never go to the Officers' Club,

01:00:43.200 --> 01:00:47.239
you don't sit
with the other Carabinieri wives.

01:00:47.320 --> 01:00:51.757
Sure, laugh !
You've always been ashamed of dad !

01:00:51.840 --> 01:00:54.992

For this fucking Diego I

Why don't you try calling him
dad, just once '?

01:01:06.360 --> 01:01:11.480
Climb down, Gemma!
Climb down, because you're a nobody !

01:01:19.280 --> 01:01:21.271
Pietro I

01:02:22.360 --> 01:02:24.351
The chickens are all dead.

01:02:25.280 --> 01:02:27.271
What '?

01:02:29.280 --> 01:02:31.271
Aska '?

01:02:32.280 --> 01:02:36.160
Nothing happened, no, I'm sorry.

01:02:38.400 --> 01:02:40.391
We have to get off of here.

01:03:22.160 --> 01:03:24.879
Here they are, my stars !

01:03:25.800 --> 01:03:27.791
Darling, hi.

01:03:28.480 --> 01:03:32.951
They're just back from Sarajevo,
Diego took some incredible shots.

01:03:33.040 --> 01:03:35.793
Listen, is what I read true
that the paring knives

01:03:35.880 --> 01:03:40.875
for pitting olives are used
to gouge people's eyes out '?

01:04:23.920 --> 01:04:29.393
"Ladies and gentlemen,
enjoy Sarajevo !"

01:05:10.840 --> 01:05:12.831
Till!!!"-

01:05:27.880 --> 01:05:29.871
Hi, my love.

How are you '? Tired '?

01:05:37.920 --> 01:05:40.196
How did it go '? How was it '?

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:46.029
Who the fuck do you think was there '?
Do you know what I did today '?

01:05:46.120 --> 01:05:49.590
I spent the entire day photographing

01:05:49.680 --> 01:05:52.672
a can of tuna.

01:05:53.480 --> 01:05:57.269
And once it was open
and once it was close, an '?

01:05:58.040 --> 01:06:00.236
Again and again.

01:06:00.320 --> 01:06:03.631
They even had a make-up artist for it,
for the fuckin tuna !

01:06:05.920 --> 01:06:11.279
She kept on moving it back
and forth between dressing rooms,

01:06:11.360 --> 01:06:14.193
like it was a fucking model.

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.719
The world is going to hell baby.

01:06:43.280 --> 01:06:45.476
And we're going down with it.

01:06:49.160 --> 01:06:52.551
I'm so sorry. Excuse me.

01:07:40.560 --> 01:07:45.077
- Grandpa, going to war '?
- Mind your fucking business.

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:11.991
Good morning, Gemma.

01:08:18.479 --> 01:08:20.470
Where is he '?

01:08:28.680 --> 01:08:30.671
Dad!

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.674
I hate this passport, mom.

01:09:15.120 --> 01:09:20.035
When they ask me why I was born
in Sarajevo, I'm ashamed.

01:09:21.520 --> 01:09:23.908
"By mistake", I say.

01:09:28.760 --> 01:09:30.751
By mistake.

01:09:45.600 --> 01:09:51.515
My dear friend Zoran, he was the
greatest wheelchair pilot ever.

01:09:52.960 --> 01:09:55.520
There's no one better than him.

01:09:56.920 --> 01:10:02.233
Today he took his father for a ride
across that open street intersection.

01:10:05.600 --> 01:10:09.992
His old man always used to say:
"Son let's race".

01:10:10.080 --> 01:10:13.072
"See if that prick on a hill
can shoot me."

01:10:15.640 --> 01:10:20.999
Zoran was a great mime
and when he was shot

01:10:21.080 --> 01:10:23.549
he fell like an artist.

01:10:29.920 --> 01:10:36.314
He loved U2,
Levis 501's and Kafka.

01:10:40.640 --> 01:10:43.712
May you rest in peace, dear friend.

01:11:28.920 --> 01:11:32.038
You can't get real flowers anymore,

01:11:32.800 --> 01:11:36.759
so the florist in Markale started
making paper ones.

01:11:40.480 --> 01:11:44.394
Look, the light of life I Thank you I

01:11:45.120 --> 01:11:49.717

How did you remember this '?

Hey, come here ! Come here !
Come on !

01:15:26.880 --> 01:15:29.599
I knew you were following us.

01:15:31.720 --> 01:15:34.109
I knew you were there.

01:15:37.360 --> 01:15:40.591
We made love that night,

01:15:40.680 --> 01:15:43.274
and again after that.

01:15:46.280 --> 01:15:48.669
Do you love her '?

01:15:51.080 --> 01:15:53.879
How can I not'?

01:16:01.040 --> 01:16:03.031
And me '?

01:16:40.040 --> 01:16:43.829
Thanks, lunch was very good.
I'm going now.

01:16:44.440 --> 01:16:48.911
- Where '? - To the University.
There's no more University, Jovan.

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:53.233
I know, I'm going to see
if there is anything I can do.

01:16:53.320 --> 01:16:55.118
Enjoy your meal.

01:18:12.440 --> 01:18:14.716
I need to talk to Aska.

01:18:14.800 --> 01:18:18.316
Call your father,
have him send all the money he can.

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.992

I'm talking to you !
Who do you think you are '?

01:18:32.040 --> 01:18:35.237

Here he <i>is</i> !
Jesus Christ <i>is</i> here !

01:18:42.080 --> 01:18:44.993
Jesus Christ is here I

01:18:45.800 --> 01:18:48.269
Where are you going '?

01:18:49.600 --> 01:18:54.629
Where are you taking that '?
Why don't you bring me some food '?

01:18:54.720 --> 01:18:58.839

I'll give you this fucking baby.

01:20:19.480 --> 01:20:23.075
As long as a sniper doesn't
get it first

01:20:25.520 --> 01:20:28.478
What do you think of this
beautiful city

01:20:28.560 --> 01:20:30.517
surrounded by cemeteries,
eh, Pietro '?

01:20:30.600 --> 01:20:32.955
The square with the chessboard
is cool.

01:20:33.040 --> 01:20:36.715
That square with the chessboard
is for pathetic old veterans.

01:20:36.800 --> 01:20:42.398
Piazza Navona is so much better.
Yeah, Piazza Navona.

01:20:43.360 --> 01:20:45.351
You are lucky.

Are you waiting for two more '?

01:21:15.040 --> 01:21:18.158

01:32:18.520 --> 01:32:23.469
Pietro's complaining, the food's crap.
He wants to come home.

01:32:23.560 --> 01:32:27.349
Where are you '?

01:32:27.920 --> 01:32:31.151
In the hotel.
Looking out the window.

01:32:35.640 --> 01:32:37.631
Should I tell him '?

01:32:39.200 --> 01:32:41.669
Should I tell him
I'm not his mother'?

01:32:53.960 --> 01:32:55.997
Don't run away, Gemma.

01:33:00.400 --> 01:33:03.472
- What shall we steal, mom '?
- What '?

01:33:04.760 --> 01:33:08.719
If you don't steal something,
it means you didn't like the place.

01:33:08.800 --> 01:33:10.757
Who said such a stupid thing '?

01:33:10.840 --> 01:33:14.276
- A Carabinieri Colonel.
- Dad '? Yes !

01:33:14.360 --> 01:33:19.116
Or rather...
do you know what I'll steal '?

01:33:20.360 --> 01:33:23.113
Classic... Look how beautiful I

01:33:26.320 --> 01:33:30.473
- Hi. - Here is my facebook name.

01:33:30.560 --> 01:33:33.279
Oh, thank you, thank you very much.

01:33:34.440 --> 01:33:38.035
- Hi. - Hi.
- Thank you very much - Bye.

01:33:38.120 --> 01:33:41.272
Indeed... Indeed...

01:33:48.360 --> 01:33:52.399
So you like her.

01:33:52.480 --> 01:33:55.632
<i>Who? - Who?
- Who?</i>

01:33:55.720 --> 01:33:58.633
I told you already I
I like Italian girls I

01:33:58.720 --> 01:34:03.078
Come here. - Give me a kiss.
- You scratch me !

01:34:03.160 --> 01:34:06.118
- Give your mother a kiss !
- I'll give you a headbutt!

01:34:06.200 --> 01:34:09.591
- Cut your nails off !
- A kiss to your mother.

01:34:09.680 --> 01:34:11.671
You are so beautiful I

01:34:15.440 --> 01:34:17.670
You scratched me.

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:31.880
Mom had gone up to the roof
to hang the laundry,

01:34:32.440 --> 01:34:36.991
it was a sunny day,
the sirens sounded.

01:34:37.080 --> 01:34:40.471
Sebina went down to the basement
with the others.

01:34:42.480 --> 01:34:46.235
It must have been some sixth sense.

01:34:46.760 --> 01:34:50.913
They went looking for each other
at exactly the same time.

01:34:51.560 --> 01:34:54.712
My mother left her laundry
on the roof

01:34:54.800 --> 01:34:59.556
and started down the stairs, just
as Sebina was coming up to find her.

01:34:59.640 --> 01:35:03.429
And the blast hit them both,
right as they found each other.

01:35:06.880 --> 01:35:09.474
The womb and its fruit.

01:35:10.800 --> 01:35:12.950
Sebina didn't die right away.

01:35:13.880 --> 01:35:16.076
She was a gymnast.

01:35:17.120 --> 01:35:20.636
She wanted to win the gold medal
in the Olympics.

01:35:22.800 --> 01:35:27.158
I'll get you the best artificial
legs in the world, I told her.

01:35:29.720 --> 01:35:36.114
Someone found one of her sneakers,
the ones that light up.

01:35:36.200 --> 01:35:39.636
So I made the stupidest
bet with myself:

01:35:41.360 --> 01:35:46.150
as long as this sneaker flashes
she will be alive.

01:36:01.280 --> 01:36:03.271
And I lost.

01:36:09.680 --> 01:36:13.355
You know who should talk about
this war, Pietro '?

01:36:14.400 --> 01:36:16.391
A comedian,

01:36:18.680 --> 01:36:21.240
someone like Buster Keaton.

01:37:36.200 --> 01:37:38.760
Are you happy with your husband '?

01:37:40.040 --> 01:37:41.838
Yin.

01:37:42.960 --> 01:37:45.873
It's a different type of love,
but I'm happy.

01:37:45.960 --> 01:37:47.951
But I'm happy-

01:37:49.120 --> 01:37:51.589
Love only comes once.

01:37:52.040 --> 01:37:57.399
It moves like the sea,
but it's always the same.

01:37:59.840 --> 01:38:01.831
Nice woman.

01:38:03.200 --> 01:38:06.113
Let me be, I'm old.

01:38:08.440 --> 01:38:13.230
You'll never be old Gemma,
time only brings off your beauty.

01:38:15.400 --> 01:38:18.791
What about you '?
Are you happy with your wife '?

01:38:20.920 --> 01:38:23.275
We have a little girl.

01:38:23.360 --> 01:38:27.957
We run a restaurant,
it's a cultural association.

01:38:32.880 --> 01:38:35.190
Do you still write poetry '?

01:39:02.520 --> 01:39:06.229
Ladies, my friends from Italy,
say "Buongiorno" to them.

01:39:06.320 --> 01:39:09.312
- "Buongiorno".
- Good Morning.

01:39:10.960 --> 01:39:15.113
- Gemma '?
- Ana '? Ana ! - Gemma!

01:39:16.920 --> 01:39:21.312
- No! Don't tell me! You two...
- Are you kidding '?

01:39:21.400 --> 01:39:24.995
I never would have married this ox.

01:39:25.080 --> 01:39:30.393
- She married me !
- Mladjo ! - Gemma ! Gemma !

01:39:30.480 --> 01:39:33.393
Yes, Gemma, and then we got divorced.

01:39:33.480 --> 01:39:35.437
She was cheating on me.

01:39:35.520 --> 01:39:38.876
You were cheating on me, you bastard.

01:39:38.960 --> 01:39:41.270
You were crazy Mladio,
the craziest of us all.

01:39:41.360 --> 01:39:44.113
Top of the list,
but God didn't want me.

01:39:44.200 --> 01:39:47.033
Yes, he's still crazy Gemma,
that's why I dumped him

01:40:01.280 --> 01:40:05.956
- This is Sebina. - Hi.
- Gemma. This is Pietro.

01:40:06.040 --> 01:40:09.476
- Hi, Pietro.
- Hi, Sebina.

01:40:59.120 --> 01:41:01.316
<i>Hi, Gemma.</i>

01:41:03.080 --> 01:41:05.071
Ail...

01:41:06.200 --> 01:41:10.990
Sorry, I wanted to tell you right away,
but I couldn't.

01:41:19.120 --> 01:41:21.111
What is this '?

01:41:22.880 --> 01:41:25.394
Now I understand everything.

01:41:26.040 --> 01:41:30.352
The whole trip,
the whole thing has been a set up.

01:41:31.440 --> 01:41:33.829
What do you want '?

01:41:37.520 --> 01:41:39.636
What do you want '?

01:41:40.960 --> 01:41:43.076
To see him.

01:41:43.160 --> 01:41:45.834
Look off the window, he's right there.

01:41:45.920 --> 01:41:49.470
- He's with his sister.
- Please shut up.

01:41:50.240 --> 01:41:52.356
What do you want '? Do you want money '?

01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:57.995
I will pay. It's no problem,
I've been paying my whole life.

01:41:58.880 --> 01:42:02.077
I gave money to every
single refugee I met.

01:42:02.160 --> 01:42:04.959
I took out my wallet and paid.

01:42:13.080 --> 01:42:15.515
I'm an Italian citizen.

01:42:15.600 --> 01:42:19.594
<i>F" MM.'</i>

01:42:20.440 --> 01:42:24.195
I'm going to leave this house now,
and I'm going to take him with me.

01:42:24.280 --> 01:42:28.797
Because he's my son,
do you hear me '?

01:42:28.880 --> 01:42:31.269
<i>He's my son.</i>

01:43:14.480 --> 01:43:21.079
I thought you were dead, or off of
your mind, crazy, locked in some place.

01:43:23.440 --> 01:43:25.397
But here you are,

01:43:25.480 --> 01:43:30.475
Young and beautiful,
still having children.

01:43:33.040 --> 01:43:35.839
Do you still listen to Nirvana '?

01:43:39.600 --> 01:43:44.356
- Kurt Cobain is dead.
- Why didn't you die '?

01:43:56.880 --> 01:43:59.554
Let me tell you the story.

01:43:59.640 --> 01:44:04.077
Are we going to make
this baby or what '?

01:44:31.160 --> 01:44:35.597
They're frying fritters downstairs,
go get me some.

01:44:35.680 --> 01:44:37.671
I'm hungry.

01:44:52.680 --> 01:44:54.478
No, no, please !
I have a wife and a son !

01:44:54.520 --> 01:44:58.115
Please !
I have a wife and a son ! Please !

01:48:40.520 --> 01:48:43.512
She has a perforated eardrum

01:48:43.600 --> 01:48:49.630
and calcified fracture in her shoulder,

01:48:49.720 --> 01:48:53.873
but no internal damage,
she's a strong woman.

01:48:55.360 --> 01:48:59.558
Her orifices will heal slowly,

01:48:59.640 --> 01:49:02.473
it will take some time.

01:49:05.800 --> 01:49:09.919
I'm ashamed to belong
to the human race.

01:49:11.680 --> 01:49:14.593
God will not forgive us,

01:49:15.560 --> 01:49:17.949
not even the children.

01:49:32.760 --> 01:49:36.151
Where were you hiding '?

01:49:38.800 --> 01:49:42.031
- They should shoot me in the belly

01:49:42.120 --> 01:49:45.476
and kill this piece of shit they made.

01:49:45.560 --> 01:49:50.077
I'll tell my wife the baby's mine,
and you won't even have to see it.

01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:55.517
And then you can get away from here,
away from this place.

01:49:56.320 --> 01:49:58.789
You could start playing again.

01:50:00.120 --> 01:50:04.910
No, my love. I'll never play again.

01:50:18.720 --> 01:50:21.109
Are you sure '?

01:50:24.760 --> 01:50:26.751
Yin.

01:50:27.240 --> 01:50:29.629
Take him away.

01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:01.391
A little bit of ink between
you and your destiny.

01:51:02.120 --> 01:51:05.431
A little dose of courage.

01:51:06.120 --> 01:51:08.111
What is it '?

01:51:09.640 --> 01:51:11.631
Alan.

01:51:15.080 --> 01:51:17.469
I can't see it.

01:51:35.360 --> 01:51:38.751
This is where life comes from.

01:51:49.480 --> 01:51:51.471
Are you ready '?

01:51:53.040 --> 01:51:55.031
Yin.

01:51:55.640 --> 01:51:57.836
Mm!!!-

01:51:59.160 --> 01:52:01.549
Ready to live.

01:55:01.840 --> 01:55:05.913
- What is the most beautiful word
for you '? - For me '? - Si.

01:55:06.400 --> 01:55:09.199
Tennis. And for you '?

01:55:09.280 --> 01:55:12.511
- Freedom.
- Freedom, uuh. - Yes.

01:55:12.600 --> 01:55:15.592
- Would you like to be a musician '?
- No.

01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:19.311
I want to build a 7-stars hotel, yeah.

01:55:19.400 --> 01:55:25.271
With a suite, with a complete golf
course inside, yeah. Big, really big.

01:55:25.360 --> 01:55:28.398
The biggest.

01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:34.790
But probably I will be a philosopher,
yeah.

01:55:38.640 --> 01:55:40.631
Pietro.

01:56:52.600 --> 01:56:58.755
For me the most beautiful word
is "grazie".
