01:12.297 --> 01:14.730
You look a bit chilly.
Can I throw my jacket over you?

01:14.899 --> 01:17.208
Oh, very smooth.

01:22.041 --> 01:24.314
<i>Oh, I wish we could
stay here.</i>

01:24.449 --> 01:26.984
<i>Oh, I don't see
why we can't.</i>

01:27.119 --> 01:29.485
<i>Well, I guess we could.</i>

01:29.620 --> 01:33.255
<i>I have a tent. June
and Danny the campers.</i>

01:33.458 --> 01:36.825
<i>A camping adventure.</i>

01:52.439 --> 01:55.036
I think we're winning.

01:55.172 --> 01:56.940
Amazing what
a little touch-up will do.

02:02.420 --> 02:04.456
You like that view,
don't you, June?

02:04.758 --> 02:06.181
Oh, there you are!

02:06.417 --> 02:09.127
Now, you won't forget about
those tiles upstairs, will you?

02:11.964 --> 02:13.356
There you go.

02:13.524 --> 02:15.057
Good as new.

02:16.735 --> 02:17.928
Now...

02:18.664 --> 02:19.765
what about that cup of tea?

02:20.534 --> 02:22.937
Yes, that would be... Yes.

02:23.206 --> 02:25.210
Would be what, Mum?

02:26.977 --> 02:28.605
Would be those.

02:29.174 --> 02:31.984
Yeah. Anyway, he does them
in about two seconds,

02:32.186 --> 02:34.111
but God help you
if you throw them out.

02:34.547 --> 02:35.649
He's going through a bit

02:35.784 --> 02:37.618
of a poo and phallus
period at the moment.

02:38.687 --> 02:39.949
Anyway, I thought
we could put them

02:40.084 --> 02:41.490
up here somewhere.
What do you think?

02:47.295 --> 02:48.332
See you, Mum.

02:50.496 --> 02:51.929
See you soon.

03:02.315 --> 03:04.506
Okay.
This will get you all going!

Apple. Ball. Tree.

03:38.150 --> 03:40.045
Yep. Now, hold on to those

03:40.181 --> 03:42.419
'cause in a moment I'll ask you
to repeat them back to me.

03:43.851 --> 03:47.391
Now, can you tell me
what this is?

03:48.355 --> 03:49.591
Go on. Tell me.

03:49.927 --> 03:51.021
It's...

03:53.725 --> 03:56.158
It's...

03:56.935 --> 03:58.100
That's alright.

04:00.600 --> 04:02.032
Got something else.

04:06.605 --> 04:07.911
Alright, June.

04:08.714 --> 04:11.074
I want you to try to read this
and do what it says.

04:19.084 --> 04:21.457
That's fine, June.
You're doing better

04:21.625 --> 04:23.187
than half my colleagues here.

04:24.123 --> 04:26.565
Now, those three words
I asked you to remember.

04:26.900 --> 04:28.267
Can you share 'em?

04:35.876 --> 04:37.067
Apple?

04:41.510 --> 04:43.341
Oh, look at you two.

04:44.244 --> 04:46.944
If only you'd spend this much
time with Lilly Hutton.

04:47.246 --> 04:49.614
Might stop her from groping
the male staff members.

04:52.755 --> 04:54.883
Oh, June, you're so sweet.

04:55.219 --> 04:56.955
You're gonna put me
out of a job.

05:28.828 --> 05:30.059
Yeah?

05:30.195 --> 05:31.659
Where... What are the...

05:31.794 --> 05:34.930
Doing another runner, are we?
4322.

05:35.165 --> 05:37.166
4322, 4322.

05:41.874 --> 05:43.298
Uh-oh.

05:45.406 --> 05:46.735
Argh!

05:47.305 --> 05:50.206
Night, June.
Try again tomorrow, yeah?

06:33.016 --> 06:34.387
Look at me.

06:34.990 --> 06:37.055
You've got something
on the end of your nose.

06:37.391 --> 06:39.955
- It looks beautiful, by the way.
- Don't be silly.

06:40.725 --> 06:43.194
<i>No, I mean it.
You always look beautiful.</i>

06:43.329 --> 06:45.296
<i>I'm supposed
to blush now, am I?</i>

06:45.431 --> 06:47.769
<i>Yes, you are.</i>

07:13.966 --> 07:15.258
Oh.

07:33.747 --> 07:35.043
There you are, lovie.

07:35.312 --> 07:36.854
I've been looking all over
for you.

07:37.223 --> 07:38.483
Where the hell am I?

07:39.085 --> 07:41.125
Looks like someone
had a bad sleep.

07:41.628 --> 07:43.390
Why don't we get you
back to your room,

07:43.526 --> 07:44.826
get you all dressed.

07:44.961 --> 07:47.397
Today is Fun Friday.
It's your favorite day.

07:47.532 --> 07:49.266
Actually, Becca,
we would rather

07:49.402 --> 07:50.700
you just answered my question.

07:51.864 --> 07:53.197
You remembered my name!

07:53.833 --> 07:55.430
I read your name tag.

07:58.277 --> 08:00.677
June, did you do this?

08:02.012 --> 08:04.681
I'm in trouble now, am I?
Did I get one wrong?

08:09.948 --> 08:11.321
It's a pen, isn't it?

08:11.490 --> 08:13.152
Unless it's a trick question,

08:13.320 --> 08:15.285
one of those silly ones
doctors always seem to have.

08:16.527 --> 08:18.157
Now those three words again?

08:18.659 --> 08:19.962
Apple. Ball. Tree.

08:20.331 --> 08:21.665
Oh, marvelous.

08:23.126 --> 08:24.525
Well, hardly.

08:24.861 --> 08:28.273
Now that we have established
I'm not a toddler, I'd very much

08:28.475 --> 08:29.871
- like to go home.
- Just a sec.

08:37.111 --> 08:39.144
June, can you tell me
who's in this?

08:41.115 --> 08:42.520
Go on, just tell me
what you see.

08:44.353 --> 08:48.316
Well, aside from the old lump
in the middle, um, that's...

08:48.752 --> 08:51.090
Ginny, my daughter,
who runs the family business.

08:51.725 --> 08:52.928
Her husband Kyle,

08:53.063 --> 08:55.195
who's a venture capitalist.
God knows what he's on.

08:55.864 --> 08:57.732
Their two boys,
Casey and Lucas.

08:58.034 --> 09:00.731
My son, Devon,
who's studying architecture.

09:00.867 --> 09:02.165
He's top of his school.

09:02.300 --> 09:04.402
His wife, Tiffany,
who is a scream.

09:04.538 --> 09:07.405
She's one of the Forsyth girls
from the property company.

09:07.840 --> 09:09.207
Their boy, Piers.

09:09.509 --> 09:12.350
And that's their lovely home,
overlooking Hermit Bay.

09:12.953 --> 09:16.313
Next to the Kobergs, who own
all the seafood restaurants.

09:18.720 --> 09:20.383
June, believe it or not,

09:20.518 --> 09:23.390
until today you couldn't tell me
what this was.

09:23.692 --> 09:25.088
It's called aphasia,

09:25.423 --> 09:27.421
that difficulty finding
the right words.

09:27.757 --> 09:29.500
It's not uncommon
with your type of dementia.

09:29.869 --> 09:31.864
The fact that you could remember
your entire family

09:32.032 --> 09:34.529
so thoroughly,
it's a miracle.

09:35.108 --> 09:36.234
I'm sorry.

09:37.508 --> 09:39.039
My type of dementia?

09:40.508 --> 09:43.781
That photo. Can you tell me
how long ago it was taken?

09:44.050 --> 09:45.177
Michael.

09:46.180 --> 09:48.348
Two or three months,
I suppose. Why?

09:49.351 --> 09:53.047
June, five years ago
you had a pretty hefty stroke,

09:53.716 --> 09:55.961
followed by a series
of much smaller ones.

09:56.797 --> 09:59.961
Unfortunately, the result
was vascular dementia.

10:00.664 --> 10:02.129
Since then, more or less,

10:02.264 --> 10:04.232
you've been living here with us
in this dementia wing.

10:04.568 --> 10:06.902
Five years?

10:08.305 --> 10:10.774
I'm having a bit of trouble
swallowing that one, doctor.

10:10.909 --> 10:13.009
Yeah. I know it's a lot
for you to process...

10:13.145 --> 10:16.176
And, as I said before, I would
very much like to go home.

10:16.311 --> 10:18.943
- I'd like to see my family now.
- We're getting hold

10:19.078 --> 10:20.377
of your children right now.

10:20.646 --> 10:23.550
Thank you, Becca. You can reach
Ginny at the factory.

10:23.853 --> 10:26.014
June, dementia isn't a disease

10:26.249 --> 10:27.588
that'll just go away.

10:28.257 --> 10:31.587
This lucidity you're
experiencing will be temporary.

10:32.256 --> 10:33.755
A few hours if we're lucky.

10:34.224 --> 10:35.833
And the slightest upset

10:35.968 --> 10:37.766
could take you right back
to where you started.

10:38.235 --> 10:40.495
So, I know you're not
going to want to hear this,

10:40.631 --> 10:42.702
but the best place for you
to be right now

10:42.837 --> 10:44.172
is right here with us.

10:44.641 --> 10:45.942
We're not a bad bunch.

10:46.344 --> 10:47.646
Fun Friday!

10:51.843 --> 10:53.410
Oh, God.

11:19.707 --> 11:21.042
Screw this.

11:25.174 --> 11:27.015
Oh!

11:29.752 --> 11:32.548
- Oh, the, um...
- 4322.

11:34.050 --> 11:35.287
Thanks!

12:00.648 --> 12:01.916
Shit!

12:02.318 --> 12:04.715
Now ladies, that's $27,
thank you very much.

12:05.384 --> 12:07.449
- Cheers. Need a receipt?
- No.

12:07.585 --> 12:09.651
- Have a good day. See ya.
- Thanks.

12:10.758 --> 12:12.093
Oh, hello.

12:21.372 --> 12:22.465
June!

12:22.601 --> 12:24.204
Would you mind if we
headed off?

12:24.373 --> 12:26.402
- I'm in a hurry.
- We're not doing a runner here,

12:26.538 --> 12:28.005
- are we?
- Yeah, we're hoping to, yes.

12:28.141 --> 12:29.206
- June!
- Yeah, look,

12:29.575 --> 12:32.081
I don't know about this.
I could lose my job

12:32.217 --> 12:34.277
- and I've got kids, you know.
- I've got kids too.

12:34.546 --> 12:36.416
Look where they put me.
Now please.

12:37.352 --> 12:39.586
Please. Come on.
It's like a prison in there.

12:39.754 --> 12:41.221
The decor alone.

12:43.356 --> 12:45.192
Fuck it!

12:45.727 --> 12:46.824
Shit!

12:47.160 --> 12:48.626
Tough luck, turkey!

12:48.895 --> 12:49.966
June!

12:56.974 --> 12:58.273
So, what did they
have you in for?

12:59.276 --> 13:01.573
A crime for which
I am completely innocent.

13:02.175 --> 13:03.947
That'd be right!

13:36.213 --> 13:38.514
Well?

13:38.950 --> 13:40.852
- June!
- Come on.

13:43.520 --> 13:44.889
June.

14:13.342 --> 14:14.344
Okay, madam.

14:14.479 --> 14:15.716
- Here we are.
- Thank you.

14:16.485 --> 14:19.086
Oh, God. I'm embarrassed to say
I don't have any money.

14:19.222 --> 14:20.886
No, no, it's all good.
It's on me.

14:21.489 --> 14:23.758
Us old ex-cons have got
to stick together, hey?

14:23.894 --> 14:25.423
You're very kind.

14:25.559 --> 14:27.998
- What's your name?
- I'm Russell. Russ.

14:28.599 --> 14:29.867
June Wilton.

14:30.002 --> 14:31.903
- Lovely to meet you, Russ.
- You too.

15:15.780 --> 15:17.245
Who on earth are you?

15:17.780 --> 15:18.974
Olive Wheatley.

15:19.377 --> 15:21.084
Are you looking for Mum?

15:23.313 --> 15:24.516
Oh, my...

15:25.151 --> 15:26.386
Are you okay?

15:26.521 --> 15:30.359
Um... what did you say
your name was, pet?

15:30.862 --> 15:32.420
- Olive.
- Olive.

15:32.989 --> 15:35.430
Who knows
Debussy's <i>First Arabesque.</i>

15:36.066 --> 15:37.898
- You know it?
- Enough to know

15:38.133 --> 15:39.267
it's no easy piece to play.

15:40.637 --> 15:44.668
Olive, could I trouble
you for a glass of water?

15:45.004 --> 15:46.109
Oh.

15:50.816 --> 15:52.577
Just taking a little tour.

15:58.821 --> 16:01.421
Oh.

16:12.097 --> 16:15.798
I think
we just made that crack bigger.

16:15.933 --> 16:19.069
I wouldn't be surprised.

16:22.577 --> 16:24.176
I don't really think
you should be in here.

16:24.311 --> 16:25.847
Oh! Oh, you are a treasure.

16:26.483 --> 16:29.178
I'm sorry,
I should've told you.

16:29.313 --> 16:30.383
I'm June Wilton.

16:30.519 --> 16:32.683
I suppose you'd say
I'm your landlady.

16:34.388 --> 16:36.126
My parents bought this house.

16:37.155 --> 16:38.590
Oh.

16:42.799 --> 16:44.068
Thank you.

16:46.831 --> 16:48.798
That's rather special,
isn't it?

16:56.707 --> 16:59.809
Oh, God, that has to be Akira.

17:05.689 --> 17:09.521
Olive, do you think that
your lovely mother would mind

17:09.656 --> 17:12.525
if I borrowed this,
just for an hour or two?

17:13.393 --> 17:14.821
I think she probably would.

17:15.090 --> 17:17.530
Well, the designer's
a close friend of mine.

17:18.805 --> 17:20.095
You could tell your mother

17:20.297 --> 17:22.663
that I'll have him send over
something from his new range.

17:22.999 --> 17:24.909
He packages everything
beautifully.

17:25.111 --> 17:26.836
Your mother will love it,
I promise.

17:28.012 --> 17:30.272
- I guess.
- Good girl.

17:30.708 --> 17:32.908
Now, I must remove these rags.

17:35.555 --> 17:36.879
Thank you.

17:54.140 --> 17:56.431
- Olive, you're a gem.
- Are you going?

17:56.734 --> 17:59.143
Oh, sorry, pet.
Yes, I am.

17:59.278 --> 18:01.475
I have to have a little word
with my kids.

18:09.149 --> 18:11.419
Mum! Thank God!

18:13.759 --> 18:15.093
Hello, pet.

18:16.927 --> 18:18.155
You know who I am.

18:18.624 --> 18:20.926
I sure do. You sold my house.

18:21.929 --> 18:24.633
Oh, my God! They said
at the home you were like this!

18:25.403 --> 18:27.336
I didn't believe it.

18:30.235 --> 18:31.604
Oh.

18:32.769 --> 18:34.241
I don't know what to say.

18:34.410 --> 18:36.070
Well, that's nothing new,
is it?

18:36.238 --> 18:38.875
Now I know it's definitely you.

18:39.777 --> 18:41.812
Oh, my God, I missed you, Mum.

18:47.654 --> 18:49.052
It must be quite a shock,
is it?

18:49.188 --> 18:50.622
Mm.

18:50.758 --> 18:53.053
I just had one of those myself,
as it happens.

18:53.289 --> 18:55.160
You couldn't wait
till I was in the ground?

18:55.296 --> 18:57.196
Oh, come on, Mum. Don't.

18:57.532 --> 18:59.329
Where did you get
those clothes?

19:00.065 --> 19:02.002
Actually, we should probably
get off their property.

19:02.138 --> 19:03.735
Yeah, yeah. I can walk.

19:12.083 --> 19:13.517
What happened to the Lexus?

19:14.220 --> 19:16.180
Oh, I wanted something
more practical.

19:16.750 --> 19:19.386
Hmm.
Where are we going, anyway?

19:19.655 --> 19:21.423
I thought we could go back
to the home

19:21.559 --> 19:23.192
and have a good catch-up.
What do you think?

19:23.561 --> 19:25.487
Don't be ridiculous.
I'm not going back there!

19:25.622 --> 19:26.756
I barely escaped.

19:27.225 --> 19:29.930
Well, it's the safest place
for you to be right now.

19:30.166 --> 19:31.362
It's what they said.

19:31.631 --> 19:32.729
And you need your medication.

19:32.864 --> 19:34.165
Ginny, are you not
listening to me?

19:34.768 --> 19:36.364
- Mum.
- Just get in the car, Ginny.

19:36.499 --> 19:39.177
I want to visit Devon's office,
and you're going to drive me.

19:52.517 --> 19:53.615
What's wrong?

19:54.251 --> 19:56.392
I'm not sure where
Devon's working right now.

19:57.257 --> 19:58.592
Give him a call.

19:59.060 --> 20:00.490
Mm.

20:01.126 --> 20:04.158
He's kind of blocking my number
a bit at the moment.

20:04.861 --> 20:06.162
- What?
- Ah, it's...

20:06.298 --> 20:08.838
It's just nothing. It's just
brother and sister stuff.

20:09.040 --> 20:10.169
Well, that's terrible.

20:10.605 --> 20:12.433
You're family.
For goodness' sake!

20:13.169 --> 20:14.872
Well, how long's
this been going on?

20:15.604 --> 20:16.907
Weeks?

20:17.850 --> 20:19.549
Months? Years?

20:19.685 --> 20:21.051
Months.

20:21.386 --> 20:24.288
- How many?
- Thirty.

20:29.358 --> 20:30.690
Give me your phone.

20:31.459 --> 20:32.890
Who are you going to call?

20:42.834 --> 20:44.835
Tiffany, darling, how are you?

20:45.204 --> 20:47.375
- <i>Is that June?</i>
- It surely is.

20:47.777 --> 20:50.876
Back from the brink.
How are you, darling?

20:51.079 --> 20:54.543
I can't believe
it's you. You sound so good.

20:54.912 --> 20:56.078
<i>Tiff, I'm a box of birds,</i>

20:56.213 --> 20:58.119
but I need to get hold
of that son of mine.

20:58.254 --> 20:59.349
Is he at work, is he?

20:59.484 --> 21:01.224
Oh, June.

21:01.593 --> 21:06.191
Um... Dev and I aren't together
anymore. We divorced

21:06.427 --> 21:07.661
<i>three years ago.</i>

21:10.264 --> 21:11.401
<i>June?</i>

21:12.868 --> 21:17.935
Um... Yes, I'm here.
I'm, um... lost for words.

21:19.902 --> 21:21.610
I... can't believe it.

21:21.812 --> 21:23.107
<i>You've tried
his mobile, have you?</i>

21:23.242 --> 21:25.576
I don't think he checks it
at work is the only thing.

21:26.045 --> 21:28.210
Well, I expect he's busy
with his architecture.

21:29.080 --> 21:31.079
Where is he working,
do you know?

21:31.515 --> 21:34.422
I think he's in the Riddiford
Building on Cowan Street.

21:34.591 --> 21:36.584
- It's new.
- <i>Cowan Street.</i>

21:37.621 --> 21:41.097
I must dash, darling, and I'll
try and give you a call later.

21:41.533 --> 21:42.998
We'll have a proper catch-up,
alright?

21:43.267 --> 21:44.632
I'd like that.

21:49.340 --> 21:50.539
I don't believe it.

21:51.239 --> 21:52.475
That boy!

21:53.807 --> 21:55.305
- Cowan Street?
- Cowan Street.

21:59.912 --> 22:01.648
Well, how's the factory
at least?

22:01.983 --> 22:05.455
The factory is great, yeah.
It's going really well.

22:08.193 --> 22:09.558
You're avoiding eye contact.

22:10.819 --> 22:12.254
I'm driving.

22:12.389 --> 22:14.397
You know I've always
been able to read you.

22:14.533 --> 22:16.264
- How are the numbers?
- Oh, Mum.

22:16.399 --> 22:18.330
Nah, we're not talking numbers.

22:18.532 --> 22:19.931
It's that bad, is it?

22:20.267 --> 22:21.298
No!

22:21.467 --> 22:24.342
Mum! God!

22:25.737 --> 22:27.337
Oh, for God's sake!

22:27.472 --> 22:30.312
Is there anything that hasn't
fallen apart in this family?

22:30.648 --> 22:33.043
Oh, don't be so dramatic!
We're fine!

22:34.219 --> 22:35.886
It's just you've come back

22:36.122 --> 22:38.345
at, like, a tricky phase.

22:38.480 --> 22:40.987
Well, I think I've come back
just in time.

22:41.423 --> 22:43.022
To do what, exactly?

22:43.591 --> 22:45.319
You let me worry about that.

22:47.294 --> 22:49.725
Now, after Devon, I want you
to drive me to the factory.

22:50.127 --> 22:51.526
I'm not taking you
to the factory.

22:51.662 --> 22:53.898
If I want to go to the factory
I'll go to the bloody factory!

22:54.034 --> 22:56.000
Yeah? Great.
Well, good luck with that.

23:01.040 --> 23:02.512
I can't believe
we're fighting already.

23:03.147 --> 23:04.439
Hmm. You could say

23:04.575 --> 23:06.879
I can't believe how quickly
things got back to normal.

23:16.392 --> 23:17.560
Two hands on the wheel.

23:25.104 --> 23:26.327
Mum, what are you doing?

23:26.462 --> 23:28.132
Stop. Wait.
I'm gonna find a park first.

23:28.267 --> 23:29.940
This is fine, pet.
I'll see you when I'm done.

23:34.077 --> 23:35.237
OKAY!

23:51.731 --> 23:53.759
Oh, excuse me. You gentlemen
don't know which floor

23:53.895 --> 23:55.895
the architecture firm's on,
do you?

24:07.774 --> 24:09.546
- Three A3s.
- Yep.

24:10.448 --> 24:11.812
- Fix your hat.
- Thank you.

24:21.051 --> 24:22.759
Sorry, madam. Just two secs.

24:23.295 --> 24:25.520
Just gonna send this bad boy

24:25.855 --> 24:27.927
on his way.

24:32.436 --> 24:34.263
- Mum!
- Hello, pet.

24:36.802 --> 24:38.476
Well, say something.

24:39.276 --> 24:40.511
I don't have long.

24:41.343 --> 24:42.645
What's going on?

24:43.777 --> 24:45.108
Are you okay?

24:45.277 --> 24:47.683
I'm fine.
It's you I'm worried about.

24:53.652 --> 24:56.322
My God! My God!

24:57.158 --> 25:00.189
This is incredible!
The fact that you're even here.

25:00.425 --> 25:02.429
You look amazing.
How did you even get here?

25:02.565 --> 25:04.127
Has no-one been in touch?

25:04.296 --> 25:06.196
I'm not allowed to have
my phone on at work.

25:06.565 --> 25:09.968
My manager's a nightmare,
and I'm on my last warning, so.

25:10.270 --> 25:13.738
Oh, Dev. I don't even know
where to begin with you.

25:13.873 --> 25:16.004
The fact that you sold my house.

25:16.140 --> 25:17.173
- Oh, yeah.
- Or the fact

25:17.309 --> 25:19.008
that you and Tiffany
are now divorced.

25:19.277 --> 25:20.717
- Yeah.
- Or that I find you working,

25:20.852 --> 25:23.818
you know... What... what is this,
a photocopy shop?

25:24.487 --> 25:26.447
We also scan and print.

25:28.389 --> 25:31.892
What happened to architecture?
You were the top student.

25:33.160 --> 25:34.856
I mean, you got your degree
at least?

25:35.192 --> 25:38.159
Yep. Yeah, yeah. Pretty much.

25:38.594 --> 25:40.934
Devon, you either have a degree
or you don't.

25:43.006 --> 25:45.869
- Oh, for God's sake.
- Listen, Mum,

25:46.038 --> 25:47.477
- can we...
- No, no, no.

25:47.613 --> 25:50.405
This divorce of yours.
Is it final?

25:52.174 --> 25:54.041
Well, it's a divorce.

25:54.243 --> 25:55.883
It's just a piece of paper.

25:57.185 --> 25:59.346
Tiffany's the best thing
that ever happened to you.

25:59.549 --> 26:01.950
Well, I'm living
with someone else now, so.

26:02.219 --> 26:04.023
You didn't tell me that. Who?

26:05.430 --> 26:07.356
Well, her name is Charelle.

26:10.865 --> 26:12.430
- Charelle.
- Yeah.

26:13.366 --> 26:15.872
It's like Rachelle,
just the other way around.

26:16.441 --> 26:18.134
Okay, this is ridiculous.

26:18.270 --> 26:19.567
- Come on. We are going.
- Mum.

26:19.702 --> 26:22.305
I'm not having you working
in a place like this.

26:22.440 --> 26:24.043
You think I'm just gonna
walk out on my job?

26:24.178 --> 26:25.845
I do, yes.
You're gonna tell your manager

26:25.981 --> 26:27.477
she no longer
requires your services.

26:27.612 --> 26:30.578
- And take this stupid hat off.
- Mum, stop it, please.

26:31.448 --> 26:32.953
- Everything alright here?
- Yep.

26:33.088 --> 26:35.617
- We're just browsing, thanks.
- Mum, stop it.

26:35.986 --> 26:37.220
Sorry, Steph.

26:37.355 --> 26:39.822
Oh, this is your mum,
is it, Devon?

26:40.458 --> 26:42.556
The one who can't put
two words together?

26:43.633 --> 26:45.064
Yeah. Well, she couldn't.

26:46.067 --> 26:49.399
- Before.
- Right. So, all those times

26:49.567 --> 26:51.772
I let you off to visit
your basically dead mother

26:51.908 --> 26:53.567
in a nursing home,
what was that?

26:54.269 --> 26:56.237
Um, well, this is her,

26:56.440 --> 26:58.374
but she's just
sort of come good.

26:59.577 --> 27:01.817
Haven't you, Mum?
Please, can you tell her?

27:03.150 --> 27:05.148
You told her
I was in a nursing home,

27:05.384 --> 27:07.090
and that I couldn't put
two words together?

27:07.226 --> 27:08.250
Really, Devon,

27:08.386 --> 27:10.784
that is monumentally
reprehensible.

27:11.487 --> 27:13.426
And I mean that
most vociferously.

27:13.595 --> 27:14.698
Alright, Mum.

27:14.833 --> 27:16.728
Devon, we're gonna have
to have another talk.

27:16.864 --> 27:18.065
- Yeah.
- Absolutely.

27:18.200 --> 27:20.167
Don't let me disrupt
your professional chitchat.

27:21.103 --> 27:23.773
Devon, I trust I'll see you
imminently.

27:26.135 --> 27:27.268
Mum, come on.

27:27.504 --> 27:29.845
- I should go after her.
- Should you?

27:30.944 --> 27:32.812
- Yep.
- Be my guest.

27:33.181 --> 27:35.114
It's been a pleasure
working with you.

27:40.192 --> 27:41.791
Alright. Great.

27:42.589 --> 27:43.727
Mum.

28:07.215 --> 28:09.082
- I won't be a sec.
- No worries.

28:34.470 --> 28:35.904
Can I help you there?

28:36.306 --> 28:38.277
Oh, thank you, no. I'm fine.

28:38.713 --> 28:40.381
June?

28:41.084 --> 28:42.911
Oh, thank God!
A face I recognize.

28:45.347 --> 28:47.318
Oh, this is unreal.

28:47.554 --> 28:50.252
I thought... Well, Ginny
told us things weren't great,

28:50.387 --> 28:51.956
but you look pretty good
to me.

28:52.091 --> 28:53.325
Yes.

28:53.461 --> 28:56.327
Reports of my demise
have been greatly exaggerated.

28:59.695 --> 29:01.338
Well, where is everybody?
Where's...

29:01.707 --> 29:03.638
Di and Tracey and Sven,
everyone?

29:03.773 --> 29:05.433
They're gone, I'm afraid, June.

29:05.569 --> 29:09.108
Ah. Ange, there's a taxi
waiting outside.

29:09.244 --> 29:11.080
Could you grab something
out of petty cash?

29:12.150 --> 29:14.609
Were you after Ginny?
I don't think she's in today.

29:14.744 --> 29:16.917
Looks like she's not

29:17.119 --> 29:20.256
the only one.
Where's Di and Tracey

29:20.391 --> 29:21.451
and Sven?

29:24.155 --> 29:26.390
June, they've left.

29:27.628 --> 29:28.799
Oh.

29:36.637 --> 29:40.266
Oh! You're gonna have to be more
careful with the registration.

29:40.402 --> 29:41.502
This isn't good enough.

29:41.638 --> 29:44.007
It's been happening
for months now.

29:44.410 --> 29:45.980
We've tried
a million formulations,

29:46.115 --> 29:47.851
had the ink guys in
every other day.

29:53.320 --> 29:54.757
What's going on over here?

29:55.026 --> 29:58.653
Huh? Having a little tea party,
are we, ladies?

29:59.793 --> 30:00.929
And who are you?

30:01.098 --> 30:02.823
Well, I could ask you
the same question.

30:03.192 --> 30:04.494
I'm June Wilton.

30:05.469 --> 30:06.661
Ginny's mum.

30:07.305 --> 30:08.395
Right.

30:08.964 --> 30:12.340
This is a wonderful surprise.
I'm Dave Spinner.

30:13.176 --> 30:14.944
They let you out of the home,
did they?

30:16.475 --> 30:17.879
You're the floor manager,
are you?

30:18.015 --> 30:19.676
No, June,
not the floor manager.

30:19.812 --> 30:22.984
Now, I should ask you why
you ripped up one of our rolls.

30:23.119 --> 30:24.948
Because this isn't
one of our rolls.

30:25.117 --> 30:26.690
This isn't our paper.

30:26.826 --> 30:28.451
Yes, it's what
we've always used.

30:28.653 --> 30:30.758
- It's Grand Milano.
- If this is Grand Milano

30:30.893 --> 30:32.227
that's your natural hair color.

30:34.792 --> 30:37.725
June, would you mind
continuing this conversation

30:37.861 --> 30:40.068
- in my office, please?
- Oh, what a good idea.

30:46.303 --> 30:47.768
Where's Ginny's office?

30:47.903 --> 30:50.347
Well, we found where Ginny
really shines

30:50.516 --> 30:51.773
is out on the floor.

30:52.142 --> 30:53.312
Ah, lolly?

30:54.253 --> 30:55.446
No.

30:56.047 --> 30:57.354
Grab a seat.

30:57.690 --> 30:59.483
So, tell me. How are we doing?

31:01.058 --> 31:04.628
Oh, well,
if I can be honest, June,

31:05.331 --> 31:08.156
things have kind of dipped off
over the last couple of years.

31:08.825 --> 31:10.665
Well, maybe you need
to give the stockists

31:10.800 --> 31:11.935
a bit more of a push.

31:12.071 --> 31:13.935
How much are Goodby's
taking on these days?

31:14.170 --> 31:15.801
We don't deal with Goodby's
anymore.

31:15.937 --> 31:17.237
What? What happened?

31:17.372 --> 31:19.842
Tom Gould's a prick,
that's what happened.

31:20.078 --> 31:22.077
Well, there are ways
of dealing with pricks.

31:23.175 --> 31:24.206
Now, I'm sure Ginny

31:24.408 --> 31:25.805
didn't hire you to burn bridges

31:25.941 --> 31:27.915
with our biggest
and oldest stockists.

31:28.217 --> 31:30.211
Well, actually,
Ginny didn't hire me.

31:30.513 --> 31:32.082
Her husband brought me in.

31:32.752 --> 31:36.182
I don't even think Ginny knows
how to hire someone.

31:36.685 --> 31:38.494
- I beg your pardon?
- Look,

31:38.763 --> 31:40.754
when I came into this place,

31:40.889 --> 31:43.366
it was an absolute
fucking disaster,

31:43.568 --> 31:44.899
pardon my French.

31:45.135 --> 31:46.960
I'm the one
who took over the books.

31:47.095 --> 31:49.136
And I don't know how
you kept this place going

31:49.272 --> 31:51.272
- as long as you did.
- We kept it going

31:51.441 --> 31:53.405
because we always put quality
before everything else.

31:53.674 --> 31:57.407
This is not Grand fucking
Milano, pardon my Italian.

31:57.576 --> 31:59.177
This is the cheap crap
from Indonesia

31:59.312 --> 32:01.409
they kept trying
to push on me.

32:01.544 --> 32:02.845
Now, I know my paper, boyo,

32:02.981 --> 32:05.547
and if I find that you are
continuing to pass this off

32:05.683 --> 32:07.287
for the paper
we made a name for

32:07.422 --> 32:09.685
I will have you gone
before you can blink.

32:14.928 --> 32:16.395
Okay, June.

32:17.795 --> 32:20.560
But before I start quaking
in my boots

32:21.062 --> 32:23.964
you should probably know
that all that control

32:24.167 --> 32:26.973
that you seem to think that
you have over this company

32:27.242 --> 32:29.907
you don't.
Your kids took it away.

32:30.743 --> 32:34.612
From a legal perspective
you've got about as much say

32:34.747 --> 32:37.278
as that old fella that comes
around here at lunchtime

32:37.413 --> 32:38.813
flogging falafels.

33:01.910 --> 33:02.980
Yes!

33:06.176 --> 33:07.281
Ah!

33:08.644 --> 33:10.647
You really are incredible.

33:11.449 --> 33:13.815
Who the hell is this David twit?

33:15.758 --> 33:17.220
No. No, Mum, no.

33:17.823 --> 33:20.159
I am not going to let you
spoil this time we have.

33:20.594 --> 33:22.262
Well, I'm sorry, pet,
but there are things

33:22.398 --> 33:24.665
- we need to talk about.
- No, there aren't.

33:25.534 --> 33:28.062
Can't you just act like a normal
mother for five minutes?

33:28.197 --> 33:31.404
I have really fucking
missed you, you know.

33:37.816 --> 33:39.245
Come on, aren't you hungry?

33:39.381 --> 33:41.512
Can't we just go back
to my place

33:41.648 --> 33:43.251
and have something
to eat or something?

33:46.383 --> 33:47.684
That'd be lovely.

33:58.037 --> 34:00.428
Listen, um,
the house is like...

34:00.631 --> 34:01.928
It's a bit messy at the moment

34:02.063 --> 34:03.532
'cause obviously
I wasn't expecting you.

34:03.667 --> 34:04.834
Don't be silly.

34:04.969 --> 34:06.736
Do you think I care
about that sort of thing?

34:13.909 --> 34:15.976
Oh, sorry about these.
They're Kyle's.

34:17.447 --> 34:19.418
He's in between offices.

34:31.996 --> 34:35.764
Ah, I know, sorry.
We've both been so busy lately.

34:36.940 --> 34:38.371
No, it's not that, it's...

34:40.210 --> 34:42.839
It's the wallpaper.
Where is it?

34:43.007 --> 34:45.275
It's gone from here,
it's gone from the hallway.

34:45.779 --> 34:49.011
Yeah, I know. Kyle finally
put his foot down.

34:49.914 --> 34:52.080
Well, you should've put yours
down harder.

34:52.616 --> 34:54.121
Preferably on top of his.

34:54.422 --> 34:56.291
You let people walk
all over you.

35:06.431 --> 35:08.105
That's my dining table.

35:09.466 --> 35:11.568
Oh, yeah, I know.

35:11.870 --> 35:13.738
The kids did that
when they were little.

35:13.873 --> 35:17.609
It's terrible, isn't it?
They were punished severely.

35:22.051 --> 35:23.450
Where's my dresser?

35:24.580 --> 35:25.788
What dresser?

35:26.091 --> 35:27.916
You know the one.
In my bedroom.

35:28.118 --> 35:31.828
No, I don't know.
Maybe Dev might've taken it?

35:31.964 --> 35:33.895
Well, could you find out? Now?

35:34.098 --> 35:35.726
Yeah, okay, I'll make a call.

35:36.194 --> 35:37.299
Now.

35:59.191 --> 36:00.615
Piers is getting hold
of Dev now.

36:00.750 --> 36:01.815
- Are you okay?
- Yep.

36:01.950 --> 36:03.193
- Are you alright?
- Mm-hmm.

36:04.688 --> 36:06.325
Um, guess what?

36:06.494 --> 36:07.854
Piers is going
to come over now.

36:08.123 --> 36:10.030
- Oh.
- He's so excited to see you.

36:10.166 --> 36:11.630
He just can't believe it.

36:12.398 --> 36:14.303
You know he's 15 now.

36:17.207 --> 36:19.001
Are you going to offer me one?

36:20.137 --> 36:22.179
I don't think that
would be a good idea, do you?

36:23.011 --> 36:24.313
Don't you now?!

36:31.021 --> 36:32.321
It's not chardonnay.

36:36.958 --> 36:39.661
I don't know why you insist
on not drinking chardonnay.

36:41.432 --> 36:43.498
So what's going on
between you and Devon?

36:43.701 --> 36:46.499
- Oh, look, it's nothing, really.
- Come on, Ginny, spill it.

36:46.701 --> 36:48.568
You know I'll find out
one way or another.

36:49.534 --> 36:51.366
Yeah. Well, that's true.

36:52.435 --> 36:54.238
But you have to promise not
to bring this up with anyone,

36:54.374 --> 36:55.377
especially not Kyle.

36:56.276 --> 36:57.412
Of course not.

36:57.881 --> 36:59.205
Well...

36:59.574 --> 37:02.749
Kyle had access to some money
that Dev was looking after

37:02.984 --> 37:05.717
and he borrowed it for this
mining venture he got wind of

37:05.852 --> 37:07.454
because they needed
some quick capital.

37:07.623 --> 37:09.390
Twenty-four hours later
we would put it all back

37:09.525 --> 37:11.294
and no-one
would be the wiser, but...

37:13.365 --> 37:15.564
Psst. It just all went to poo,
didn't it?

37:16.000 --> 37:17.232
Ginny, that is awful.

37:17.567 --> 37:20.369
And you cannot mention
the mining part to Dev.

37:20.537 --> 37:22.397
You know what he's like
about the environment.

37:22.766 --> 37:24.703
We told him it was a wind farm.

37:32.610 --> 37:33.943
This is lovely, pet.

37:35.052 --> 37:36.516
Oh, it's nothing fancy.

37:36.652 --> 37:39.184
No, I meant sitting out here
with you.

37:39.620 --> 37:41.954
Oh, I know.
Isn't it amazing?

37:42.323 --> 37:43.986
I'm just still buzzing

37:44.121 --> 37:46.060
that I can have a conversation
with you.

37:46.262 --> 37:47.891
However long it may last.

37:49.092 --> 37:50.630
We're not going to talk
about that.

37:51.498 --> 37:53.601
Pet, this factory situation.

37:53.736 --> 37:56.168
- Please, no, Mum.
- It's all about maintaining

37:56.304 --> 37:57.470
our point of difference.

37:57.606 --> 37:59.634
Hand-printing has always
been the thing

37:59.770 --> 38:00.936
- that we do.
- Mum.

38:01.238 --> 38:03.444
You don't have to worry
about this stuff anymore.

38:03.580 --> 38:05.777
Oh, don't be silly.
I'm happy to help.

38:07.648 --> 38:09.483
Anyway, it's fine

38:09.685 --> 38:11.321
because I've been putting
a plan together.

38:12.321 --> 38:13.917
A plan? What do you mean?

38:14.685 --> 38:15.985
You're eating off it.

38:21.758 --> 38:23.127
That's Botanica.

38:23.930 --> 38:26.832
Yeah. What do you think?
It's just a sample,

38:26.967 --> 38:28.871
but it would work with so many
of your patterns.

38:29.006 --> 38:30.172
We could do mats,

38:30.541 --> 38:33.199
table napkins, crockery,
all hand-printed.

38:33.335 --> 38:35.242
I've costed it up.
It's really reasonable.

38:35.378 --> 38:37.011
Remember our guy Len in China?

38:37.280 --> 38:38.612
Our China-man? Of course.

38:39.680 --> 38:41.349
Mum, you can't say that
anymore.

38:41.485 --> 38:44.112
- But he's been amazing.
- Ginny, no.

38:44.647 --> 38:45.751
No, no, no.

38:45.886 --> 38:48.852
Wallpaper, pet, we make
wallpaper. Not plates.

38:49.354 --> 38:52.328
This is why businesses slow
down, because you lose focus.

38:52.497 --> 38:54.256
- That's not the reason.
- But look at you,

38:54.459 --> 38:57.323
wanting to change everything.
You're as bad as your brother.

38:57.458 --> 38:59.468
Neither of you knows how
to stick at one thing.

39:02.369 --> 39:03.835
Have you finished?

39:05.102 --> 39:06.576
With which,
my lunch or my point?

39:06.811 --> 39:07.806
Both.

39:37.574 --> 39:40.643
Ginny, I'm really sorry.
You're so right.

39:40.779 --> 39:43.603
We should just make the most
of this time that we've got.

39:44.072 --> 39:47.142
Yeah. I'm so sorry too, Mum.

39:48.177 --> 39:51.146
This must be so strange
for you.

39:53.423 --> 39:55.084
You know what I'd really love?

39:56.227 --> 39:57.887
Just for us all to be together.

39:58.423 --> 40:01.025
You know, I was thinking,
if it's not too much trouble,

40:01.160 --> 40:03.697
we might have an impromptu
get-together here later.

40:05.698 --> 40:07.328
Yeah, that's a nice idea.

40:09.903 --> 40:12.273
Ah, that'll be Piers.

40:12.609 --> 40:15.170
- Hello? Aunt Ginny?
- Hey!

40:15.639 --> 40:17.206
Oh, my goodness!

40:17.575 --> 40:18.745
Hello, Grandma.

40:20.577 --> 40:23.380
- What's with the limp?
- Just bit of a bike accident.

40:23.649 --> 40:25.345
Oh, you poor thing.

40:26.057 --> 40:27.220
You know who I am?

40:27.723 --> 40:30.086
Well, of course I do.

40:30.953 --> 40:32.362
Last time I saw you

40:32.497 --> 40:33.786
I could rest my drink
on your head.

40:35.765 --> 40:37.564
Did you have any luck
finding my dresser?

40:37.766 --> 40:39.392
Not yet.
Dad's going to have a look.

40:39.594 --> 40:42.230
You know, Piers comes to see you
all the time, Mum.

40:42.566 --> 40:43.938
Do you?

40:44.073 --> 40:46.771
I made a documentary about you
for film studies last year.

40:46.940 --> 40:48.740
Oh, isn't that lovely?

40:48.909 --> 40:50.612
Yeah, it's on YouTube.
Want to see it?

40:52.308 --> 40:55.282
Well, actually,
that would be terrific.

40:55.418 --> 40:56.819
Perhaps we could watch it

40:56.955 --> 41:00.656
while your aunty goes and gets
my medication from that place.

41:00.791 --> 41:03.823
Oh, shit, yes, good point.
I will do that, yes.

41:03.958 --> 41:05.961
I do worry about your memory
sometimes, pet.

41:14.401 --> 41:16.998
<i>This is
June Wilton, my grandmother.</i>

41:17.434 --> 41:19.174
<i>She's the most
inspirational person I know.</i>

41:19.977 --> 41:22.435
<i>But, sadly, she doesn't know
she's my grandmother.</i>

41:23.171 --> 41:25.178
<i>Hi, Grandma. Say hello.</i>

41:25.514 --> 41:26.807
<i>Do you know who I am?</i>

41:27.076 --> 41:30.250
<i>I am... And all those things.</i>

41:31.120 --> 41:33.686
- <i>What things, Grandma?</i>
- <i>All my things.</i>

41:33.989 --> 41:38.158
<i>And... that we were.
The way we were,</i>

41:38.360 --> 41:40.794
<i>like that. I...</i>

41:42.426 --> 41:45.458
Wow, well done, Piers,
that is very professional.

41:56.105 --> 41:57.640
Right, we have work to do.

41:58.343 --> 42:01.517
Ha-ha, rather you than me.
But, Penny, truly,

42:01.686 --> 42:05.016
thank you, for this.
Oh, I know he will.

42:06.147 --> 42:08.888
Yep, okay. Bye-bye. Bye.

42:10.489 --> 42:11.561
Yes.

42:20.070 --> 42:21.329
Oh!

42:33.014 --> 42:36.719
<i>♪ Take me in your arms ♪</i>

42:36.855 --> 42:41.685
<i>♪ Thrill me
With all of your charms ♪</i>

42:42.588 --> 42:47.163
<i>♪ And I'll take to the sky
On a natural high ♪</i>

42:47.899 --> 42:50.961
<i>♪ Loving you more
Till the day I die... ♪</i>

42:51.097 --> 42:53.060
I like this. What is it?

42:53.363 --> 42:55.165
You don't know this one?

42:57.974 --> 43:02.403
Oh, Charlie Horse.
This is one of my favorites.

43:10.550 --> 43:11.885
We're home.

43:24.428 --> 43:26.526
Yeah, okay, gorgeous.
I'll see you soon.

43:27.563 --> 43:30.002
- See who soon, Mum?
- Oh, you're back.

43:30.837 --> 43:32.171
What's going on in there?

43:32.306 --> 43:34.768
I thought we were having
a nice family get-together.

43:34.970 --> 43:36.307
And we are.

43:36.443 --> 43:39.077
I just thought we could kick it
off with a nice family meeting.

43:42.787 --> 43:45.287
Boys, I asked you
to get changed.

43:45.422 --> 43:46.753
Oh, my goodness.

43:46.922 --> 43:49.257
Oh, God. What mischief
do we have here?

43:49.860 --> 43:52.420
Come on, boys. Say hello
to Grandma Junie.

43:53.860 --> 43:55.524
- Boys!
- Hi.

43:55.660 --> 43:57.865
Screens down, come on.
Give her a nice, warm hug.

43:58.399 --> 43:59.431
Big hug.

43:59.567 --> 44:01.968
Hello. Hello.

44:06.243 --> 44:07.501
Hey, gang.

44:08.976 --> 44:10.779
Your mum's here.

44:11.615 --> 44:13.507
- Hello, Kyle.
- Hey.

44:15.516 --> 44:16.575
What's going on?

44:16.844 --> 44:20.284
Uh, mum's having, like,
a break from her dementia.

44:20.887 --> 44:22.391
- Okay.
- Right. Well,

44:22.526 --> 44:23.592
we may as well get started.

44:23.727 --> 44:26.355
Devon hopefully
will be here soon.

44:26.624 --> 44:28.988
Kyle and Ginny, if you
wouldn't mind taking a seat.

44:29.624 --> 44:31.591
Piers, might as well
stick around.

44:35.604 --> 44:37.201
That should be Devon.

44:51.617 --> 44:52.887
Dev.

45:00.862 --> 45:02.831
Come on in, pet.
Grab a seat.

45:22.878 --> 45:25.414
Mum, could you please tell us
what this is all about?

45:27.684 --> 45:30.191
Well, I guess you might call it
an intervention.

45:31.725 --> 45:32.795
Uh, this... Right.

45:32.997 --> 45:34.654
This is not really
how an intervention works.

45:34.789 --> 45:36.355
Yeah.
You've kind of got the numbers

45:36.490 --> 45:37.799
around the wrong way here, June.

45:37.968 --> 45:39.898
Well, this is my take on it,
then, isn't it?

45:40.101 --> 45:42.462
You really are unbelievable.

45:42.598 --> 45:44.772
Look, I'm sorry
that I have to do this,

45:44.908 --> 45:46.743
but my time is short,
as you know.

45:47.979 --> 45:51.438
I don't know what
has happened to this family.

45:51.874 --> 45:55.879
Everything was going so well.
Ginny with the factory.

45:56.515 --> 45:59.053
Kyle with all the big deals
that you were doing.

45:59.221 --> 46:02.452
Devon with your architecture
and your beautiful wife

46:02.587 --> 46:05.057
and the big house
that her parents bought you.

46:05.226 --> 46:08.831
You were so happy.
And I come back and...

46:10.000 --> 46:12.395
I find this.
Everything's fallen apart.

46:14.799 --> 46:17.237
Now there are some bridges that
need mending in this family.

46:17.373 --> 46:20.734
Kyle, Ginny, Devon, I think
it's time that the three of you

46:20.969 --> 46:24.578
just moved on past this whole
mining company thing,

46:24.747 --> 46:25.948
- don't you?
- Mum!

46:26.083 --> 46:28.175
You've got to be kidding me!

46:28.410 --> 46:30.819
It was a mining company. Right.

46:31.088 --> 46:34.085
Come on! I just wanna
see you all say sorry

46:34.254 --> 46:36.152
- and have a big hug.
- Yeah.

46:36.388 --> 46:38.287
Mum, I reckon
you've done enough

46:38.422 --> 46:40.060
irreparable damage
for one day.

46:40.195 --> 46:42.932
- Devon, how can you...
- No, Mum, no more.

46:43.201 --> 46:45.724
You know I pretty much lost
my job today because of you.

46:45.860 --> 46:48.130
Pretty much? You either lost it
or you didn't.

46:48.265 --> 46:49.804
Everything is so black and white

46:49.973 --> 46:51.500
- with you, isn't it?
- You know what?

46:51.668 --> 46:53.466
I wouldn't be terribly
disappointed if you did.

46:53.635 --> 46:55.637
It was a ridiculous job
for you.

46:56.673 --> 46:58.704
- Thank you.
- Anyway, as luck would have it

46:58.840 --> 47:00.640
I happened to be talking
to a friend today

47:00.776 --> 47:02.877
whose sister owns
a drafting company.

47:03.012 --> 47:05.855
I told her about you, and she'd
be very interested in meeting.

47:05.990 --> 47:07.485
Now, it wouldn't be
architecture per se,

47:07.621 --> 47:11.392
but I'm sure if you stick at it,
you could work your way up.

47:11.527 --> 47:12.687
Mm, yeah,

47:12.855 --> 47:15.656
you don't just work your way up
into architecture, Mum.

47:15.858 --> 47:18.032
Well, you certainly won't
with that attitude.

47:21.472 --> 47:22.795
Who's that?

47:24.070 --> 47:25.336
Who else is coming?

47:29.974 --> 47:31.509
Oh!

47:31.844 --> 47:32.875
Oh, my God!

47:36.219 --> 47:38.713
You know I only came
because it's you, don't you?

47:38.915 --> 47:41.657
And you're absolutely sure
everyone's okay with this?

47:41.860 --> 47:43.919
Pet, you are
part of the family.

47:50.393 --> 47:52.066
It's very quiet.

47:56.836 --> 47:58.105
Hello, everyone.

48:00.034 --> 48:03.044
Tiff! So good to see you.
Let me take that.

48:07.684 --> 48:10.579
Alright. Stuff this.

48:12.248 --> 48:13.714
- Hey.
- Hi.

48:16.258 --> 48:17.685
<i>Devon,
where are you going?</i>

48:19.828 --> 48:21.253
Devon, stop, please.

48:21.689 --> 48:23.656
Why did you have to come back?

48:23.825 --> 48:26.197
I was just getting
my shit together.

48:26.399 --> 48:28.131
Oh, Dev, you had
your shit together.

48:28.400 --> 48:30.138
All you had to do
was keep going.

48:30.273 --> 48:32.173
You were top of your course,
for Christ's sake.

48:32.309 --> 48:36.275
I was top of one class
for one semester. That's it.

48:37.076 --> 48:38.374
You never told me that.

48:38.509 --> 48:40.445
I made one comment
about a building

48:40.580 --> 48:43.411
and suddenly I'm enrolled
in architecture school.

48:43.614 --> 48:45.284
I just gave you
some encouragement.

48:45.453 --> 48:48.290
Encouragement, yes,
like how you encouraged me

48:48.526 --> 48:49.882
to marry Tiff.

48:51.622 --> 48:53.424
You want to know
about your dresser?

48:54.388 --> 48:55.591
I sold it.

48:56.692 --> 48:58.896
On eBay.
And I got 50 bucks for it.

48:59.065 --> 49:00.260
And that is the address.

49:03.135 --> 49:04.437
And there's your $50.

49:04.573 --> 49:07.303
I was going to offer to go up
and get it back for you,

49:07.438 --> 49:08.835
but I don't feel like it
anymore.

49:08.971 --> 49:10.947
And, besides,
it's miles out of town anyway.

49:14.117 --> 49:15.874
At least let me give you
the phone number

49:16.010 --> 49:18.350
for the drafting company.

49:22.719 --> 49:24.422
Oh, Piers,
I'm glad you're here.

49:25.620 --> 49:27.425
Hey, Dad, wait up.

49:32.766 --> 49:34.003
Thanks.

50:24.883 --> 50:27.683
You just never stopped working
all our lives, did you?

50:29.052 --> 50:31.658
I suppose you must've thought
I never had a life.

50:32.694 --> 50:35.031
You know this is really a job
for two people, don't you?

50:35.862 --> 50:37.264
It is.

50:38.493 --> 50:39.827
I'll get my apron.

50:42.206 --> 50:44.205
Do you think I went too far
tonight too?

50:45.104 --> 50:46.405
Maybe a touch.

50:49.046 --> 50:51.042
It's Devon
I'm most worried about.

50:51.178 --> 50:52.807
Oh, he'll be fine.

50:53.009 --> 50:55.183
He's just had a rough time
the last few years.

51:02.291 --> 51:03.750
Mum, there's something
that happened

51:03.886 --> 51:06.524
just after your stroke.
An accident.

51:08.565 --> 51:11.533
This hasn't got something to do
with Piers' limp, has it?

51:12.269 --> 51:14.059
Do you remember the driveway
that they had?

51:14.395 --> 51:15.632
Yes.

51:15.767 --> 51:18.130
Well, Piers was sitting in it
just behind

51:18.266 --> 51:20.571
<i>that big stupid
four-wheel drive they had,</i>

51:20.706 --> 51:22.610
<i>fixing his bike
with his headphones in.</i>

51:23.312 --> 51:25.448
And Devon got in
in his usual rush...

51:25.583 --> 51:26.809
Oh, stop.

51:27.445 --> 51:28.744
God, it was horrible, Mum.

51:30.480 --> 51:32.154
He nearly lost his leg.

51:34.886 --> 51:37.258
I don't think Devon's
ever really recovered.

51:38.493 --> 51:40.888
You know what he's like
dealing with stuff.

51:43.695 --> 51:45.398
That explains so much.

51:46.496 --> 51:48.698
I feel like such a fool.

51:52.041 --> 51:53.509
Maybe we should wrap up now.

51:53.811 --> 51:55.103
No, we're not finished.

51:55.773 --> 51:57.245
I thought this was
just for fun.

51:59.148 --> 52:00.942
No, my dear, this is for you.

52:01.311 --> 52:02.574
Oh, what?

52:03.077 --> 52:05.918
Mum, we don't...
I don't need wallpaper.

52:06.120 --> 52:07.446
You most certainly do.

52:07.782 --> 52:08.982
It's for the living room.

52:09.118 --> 52:11.654
I thought if you reupholstered
those couches

52:11.789 --> 52:13.954
in a sort of dark blue-grey
to match

52:14.123 --> 52:16.055
and get some bright cushions
to lift it a bit.

52:18.661 --> 52:20.334
Actually, I have a thought.

52:22.934 --> 52:25.603
What if we layer this
over the top instead?

52:27.604 --> 52:29.537
Damascus? That won't work.

52:29.672 --> 52:31.311
Yeah, it's a bit unusual, but...

52:31.447 --> 52:33.215
They're both too intricate.
They'll fight.

52:33.384 --> 52:35.446
Not if I knock it back a bit.
Let me show you.

52:35.648 --> 52:37.980
You can't mix
such similar patterns.

52:38.550 --> 52:40.519
- Why not?
- You just can't!

52:40.754 --> 52:42.520
- It's one of those things.
- You and your rules!

52:42.655 --> 52:44.091
Can you just let me
prove you wrong?

52:44.226 --> 52:45.825
- I guarantee...
- Ginny, no!

52:46.661 --> 52:49.693
Can we just stick to the plan
for once in your life?

52:50.999 --> 52:52.198
God, no wonder...

52:52.634 --> 52:54.494
What, orders would've been
flying out the door

52:54.630 --> 52:55.661
if you'd been here?

52:55.796 --> 52:57.232
No, I didn't say that.

52:58.202 --> 53:01.105
You know what I've enjoyed most
about the last five years?

53:01.574 --> 53:03.906
Not being reminded
every single day

53:04.041 --> 53:06.006
of what a fucking
disappointment I am to you.

53:21.058 --> 53:23.529
Come on, Mum. We need
to wash down the screens.

53:59.736 --> 54:01.028
Oh.

54:18.947 --> 54:21.048
Pet, those plates of yours...

54:26.428 --> 54:28.088
You gonna stay in there
all night?

54:28.622 --> 54:29.760
Oh.

54:38.607 --> 54:40.609
<i>Hi, Grandma. Say hello.</i>

54:41.078 --> 54:42.471
<i>Do you know who I am?</i>

54:42.607 --> 54:45.613
<i>I am... And all those things.</i>

54:45.782 --> 54:48.081
- <i>What things, Grandma?</i>
- <i>All my things.</i>

54:48.350 --> 54:50.077
<i>The way we were, like that.</i>

54:51.250 --> 54:52.420
<i>I...</i>

54:55.420 --> 54:56.952
<i>Where are you?</i>

55:15.439 --> 55:17.269
Oh, God.

55:28.323 --> 55:29.820
Don't touch it.

55:30.852 --> 55:32.385
It'll start dripping.

55:32.988 --> 55:37.129
Mmm.
Isn't this an adventure?

55:52.479 --> 55:54.042
God, I wish you were mine.

55:54.744 --> 55:57.276
I know, Charlie Horse.

56:21.075 --> 56:22.301
Oh.

56:41.997 --> 56:43.756
- <i>This is Tom.</i>
- Hello, Tom Gould.

56:44.225 --> 56:45.760
<i>June?</i>

56:46.329 --> 56:48.734
I bet you never thought
you'd hear my voice again.

56:51.007 --> 56:52.364
Bye, boys.

56:53.076 --> 56:54.333
Bye, Grandma.

57:01.379 --> 57:03.782
Tell your mother I'm sorry
when you see her, will you?

57:05.215 --> 57:07.555
Or you could just text her,
I suppose.

58:30.732 --> 58:31.837
Shit.

59:11.938 --> 59:13.175
Later.

59:14.040 --> 59:15.749
Be good.

59:18.616 --> 59:19.652
Hey, boys.

59:19.787 --> 59:21.214
Thanks, Piers,
you're a lifesaver.

59:21.350 --> 59:22.721
It's no problem,
Aunt Ginny.

59:22.890 --> 59:25.253
You boys ready to go?
Let's do it.

59:32.159 --> 59:33.432
Don't pull it so hard.

59:33.634 --> 59:35.197
- I'm not.
- You are.

59:36.096 --> 59:37.397
There you go.

59:42.713 --> 59:44.880
- What does it say?
- Oh, you can't read?

59:47.645 --> 59:48.780
"Dearest Ginny,

59:48.915 --> 59:50.916
"it's taken me a long time
to learn

59:51.051 --> 59:52.912
"what you two both seem
to have always known,

59:53.048 --> 59:54.351
"that I'm a silly fool.

59:55.187 --> 59:57.217
"I see now that the best way
I can help you

59:57.353 --> 59:58.918
"is to simply
get out of your way.

59:59.187 --> 01:00:00.495
"So, that's what I'm doing.

01:00:00.630 --> 01:00:02.426
"I've gone
to get my dresser back.

01:00:02.996 --> 01:00:04.991
"I will not be
any further nuisance.

01:00:05.194 --> 01:00:07.526
"PS, I'm borrowing your car."

01:00:52.112 --> 01:00:54.344
You know, this place
looks good on you.

01:00:54.680 --> 01:00:55.941
Oh, thank you.

01:00:56.944 --> 01:01:00.821
Must be all this fresh air.
It's very slimming.

01:01:02.950 --> 01:01:07.429
I was thinking we should look
into getting a place up here

01:01:07.631 --> 01:01:10.061
one of these days.
Don't you think?

01:01:18.598 --> 01:01:20.267
Have you noticed
that you go quiet

01:01:20.436 --> 01:01:21.737
whenever we talk about
the future?

01:01:21.872 --> 01:01:23.635
Do I?

01:01:50.071 --> 01:01:51.796
What the hell is it
about this dresser?

01:01:51.932 --> 01:01:55.711
I mean, do you know?
God, she's a pain in the arse.

01:01:56.546 --> 01:01:58.012
Yeah, welcome to my world.

01:01:58.181 --> 01:02:00.639
Oh, you drive around looking
for Mum all the time, do you?

01:02:03.115 --> 01:02:05.083
I do spend a lot of time
with her.

01:02:05.951 --> 01:02:08.315
Okay. So we're going there.

01:02:08.484 --> 01:02:10.958
I'm not having a go,
I'm just saying.

01:02:11.093 --> 01:02:13.184
Yeah, I'm not having a go,
I'm just having a go.

01:02:13.319 --> 01:02:14.655
Look, we all know

01:02:14.824 --> 01:02:18.424
that you take the more showy,
high-visibility responsibilities

01:02:18.559 --> 01:02:19.934
with Mum, alright?

01:02:20.203 --> 01:02:23.628
And you do all the invisible
behind-the-scenes work, do you?

01:02:23.763 --> 01:02:25.933
Yes, I do.
As a matter of fact, yes.

01:02:26.069 --> 01:02:27.268
Oh, yeah? Like what?

01:02:27.404 --> 01:02:30.240
Like the power-of-attorney
stuff.

01:02:30.509 --> 01:02:33.705
- I helped with that too!
- No, that's true, isn't it?

01:02:33.907 --> 01:02:36.211
I do remember you and Kyle
being very helpful

01:02:36.347 --> 01:02:38.451
sorting out Mum's finances,
yeah.

01:02:39.221 --> 01:02:42.153
You know, we've almost
put all that money back now.

01:02:42.987 --> 01:02:44.683
It just about ruined us.

01:02:46.519 --> 01:02:48.093
Well, aren't you two saints?

01:02:55.098 --> 01:02:56.530
Holy shit, that's Mum.

01:02:58.903 --> 01:02:59.936
Are you sure?

01:03:00.071 --> 01:03:02.701
Yes. What the hell's she doing?

01:03:13.817 --> 01:03:15.021
Mum.

01:03:17.284 --> 01:03:18.420
Are you okay?

01:03:20.421 --> 01:03:21.797
What happened to your feet?

01:03:22.596 --> 01:03:23.799
Oh.

01:03:24.466 --> 01:03:25.966
Where's the car?

01:03:31.600 --> 01:03:33.073
We need to get her
back to the home.

01:03:33.209 --> 01:03:35.837
I really didn't want you
to have to come out here

01:03:35.972 --> 01:03:36.973
looking for me.

01:03:37.108 --> 01:03:38.473
No, course you didn't, Mum.

01:03:39.040 --> 01:03:40.043
Devon,

01:03:40.412 --> 01:03:42.147
Devon, Ginny told me
about what happened.

01:03:43.112 --> 01:03:44.479
With the accident.

01:03:45.814 --> 01:03:48.351
I can't stop thinking about it.
It's just terrible.

01:03:49.820 --> 01:03:50.958
Okay.

01:03:52.157 --> 01:03:53.961
Will you talk to me about it?

01:04:03.170 --> 01:04:04.972
I'm sure it's not as bad
as it looks.

01:04:06.337 --> 01:04:07.833
Kyle's gonna have

01:04:07.968 --> 01:04:09.443
- another breakdown.
- Oh, shut up, Dev!

01:04:09.645 --> 01:04:11.010
Mum, you have dementia.

01:04:11.146 --> 01:04:12.772
You shouldn't be anywhere
near a car.

01:04:12.907 --> 01:04:14.610
- You could've killed someone.
- Well, I didn't.

01:04:15.146 --> 01:04:16.709
As far as you know.

01:04:17.917 --> 01:04:19.317
And all for a dresser.

01:04:20.453 --> 01:04:22.480
Mum, do you reckon
you could drive slowly forward

01:04:22.616 --> 01:04:23.925
while we try and push it out?

01:04:24.261 --> 01:04:25.355
Really?

01:04:32.797 --> 01:04:35.536
Mum, whenever you're ready,
just nice and slow, okay?

01:04:35.672 --> 01:04:37.466
- Roger that.
- Okay.

01:04:44.238 --> 01:04:45.870
Stop. Stop!

01:04:46.339 --> 01:04:47.748
Stop! Fuck!

01:04:52.015 --> 01:04:53.350
Oh.

01:04:55.383 --> 01:04:56.892
I didn't do that, did I?

01:05:16.973 --> 01:05:18.111
Great.

01:05:23.416 --> 01:05:27.083
Well, as fun as this
family outing's been

01:05:27.218 --> 01:05:28.717
I need to get back to the city.

01:05:29.052 --> 01:05:30.452
My dresser.

01:05:30.621 --> 01:05:34.428
Mum, please, what is it
about the dresser?

01:05:35.431 --> 01:05:37.626
Look, it's just not especially
easy for me to talk about.

01:05:37.995 --> 01:05:39.132
I'm done.

01:05:40.732 --> 01:05:45.237
The... The dresser was made
for me by a man who I...

01:05:46.272 --> 01:05:49.472
was seeing
when you were kids.

01:05:54.247 --> 01:05:56.109
I made a rather
terrible mistake.

01:05:56.945 --> 01:06:00.816
A mistake? That's perfectly
understandable, Mum.

01:06:01.719 --> 01:06:04.357
Given everything that Dad
was getting up to.

01:06:04.726 --> 01:06:05.994
Thank you, but...

01:06:07.257 --> 01:06:08.722
that wasn't the mistake.

01:06:12.032 --> 01:06:13.496
Ending it was the mistake.

01:06:17.964 --> 01:06:20.607
Devon, I don't know
if you knew this

01:06:20.809 --> 01:06:22.434
about your father too,

01:06:22.636 --> 01:06:24.045
- but...
- He was gay, Mum.

01:06:25.274 --> 01:06:26.344
Of course I knew.

01:06:26.479 --> 01:06:28.313
I may be an idiot,
but I'm not an idiot.

01:06:30.379 --> 01:06:31.910
Who was he, Mum?

01:06:34.583 --> 01:06:36.684
Well, it was all very strange.

01:06:38.860 --> 01:06:39.926
Your father used to say

01:06:40.061 --> 01:06:41.428
I should go out
and find someone

01:06:41.563 --> 01:06:44.694
just to ease the guilt over
all his escapades, I suppose.

01:06:45.530 --> 01:06:48.333
But I wasn't interested
in the least.

01:06:49.970 --> 01:06:51.501
But this just happened.

01:06:53.241 --> 01:06:55.105
He was the last person
you'd expect,

01:06:55.240 --> 01:06:57.012
he was a big bear of a man.

01:06:57.778 --> 01:06:59.707
Yeah. And...

01:07:01.712 --> 01:07:04.316
the dresser was something
he made for me.

01:07:05.381 --> 01:07:06.944
Built entirely by hand.

01:07:07.347 --> 01:07:11.818
His way of expressing his
feelings for me, I suppose.

01:07:13.020 --> 01:07:16.856
He was a very
uncomplicated man, and...

01:07:18.795 --> 01:07:21.234
it was the one piece
of him that I kept.

01:07:28.078 --> 01:07:29.904
Well,
I don't know about you,

01:07:30.039 --> 01:07:32.573
Dev, but I think we need
to get this dresser, don't you?

01:07:32.709 --> 01:07:34.676
Like I said,
I've got to get back.

01:07:36.710 --> 01:07:38.151
But we are all the way out here,

01:07:38.287 --> 01:07:40.085
and I haven't had a ride,
so why not?

01:07:40.354 --> 01:07:42.455
Who's the saint now?

01:07:42.591 --> 01:07:43.718
Ow!

01:07:55.230 --> 01:07:56.434
Hello?

01:07:57.936 --> 01:07:59.074
Tom.

01:08:00.203 --> 01:08:02.033
Hi. Hi, hi.

01:08:03.107 --> 01:08:04.706
How are you?

01:08:06.144 --> 01:08:07.841
- Mum.
- Mm?

01:08:09.084 --> 01:08:10.745
- Can I have a word?
- Sure.

01:08:16.091 --> 01:08:19.152
- So, I just...
- How's Tom?

01:08:19.921 --> 01:08:22.697
Please, don't cut me off.
Tom's good.

01:08:22.966 --> 01:08:25.799
- Good.
- Mum, how dare you

01:08:26.068 --> 01:08:28.965
take my stuff?
And... Tom Gould?

01:08:29.234 --> 01:08:30.635
Ginny, I only did it

01:08:30.770 --> 01:08:33.305
because I have a relationship
with Tom that you don't.

01:08:34.140 --> 01:08:35.575
We go back a long way.

01:08:36.344 --> 01:08:38.774
And I thought maybe
you never would.

01:08:40.743 --> 01:08:42.383
Darling, the plates
are wonderful.

01:08:42.519 --> 01:08:45.118
You were right. This could be
what gets us back on top.

01:08:45.287 --> 01:08:47.452
Do you know how hard
I've worked on this?

01:08:48.317 --> 01:08:49.457
It's so you.

01:08:50.127 --> 01:08:51.682
Just come along
just before I'm done

01:08:51.818 --> 01:08:53.126
and take it away from me.

01:08:53.328 --> 01:08:55.988
No-one is taking anything
away from you.

01:08:57.163 --> 01:08:58.892
Ginny, that studio of yours

01:08:59.060 --> 01:09:01.497
is one of the most
beautiful things I've ever seen.

01:09:01.631 --> 01:09:03.267
But you cannot hide away
in there.

01:09:03.669 --> 01:09:06.072
You think I'm hiding?
They're not ready.

01:09:06.341 --> 01:09:07.832
We're not ready
to go into production.

01:09:07.969 --> 01:09:09.406
I'll never have them
done in time!

01:09:09.541 --> 01:09:10.703
What, you're going
into production?

01:09:10.840 --> 01:09:12.877
He wants 10,000
of the damn things!

01:09:13.011 --> 01:09:14.215
Oh!

01:09:14.948 --> 01:09:16.078
Oh, darling,

01:09:16.313 --> 01:09:18.813
that's wonderful.

01:09:19.479 --> 01:09:20.779
Oh, Ginny.

01:09:21.149 --> 01:09:25.116
Yes, it's wonderful, Mum,
but I turned him down.

01:09:26.761 --> 01:09:27.955
You what?

01:09:29.024 --> 01:09:31.395
- He wouldn't meet my price.
- Oh, Ginny, God,

01:09:31.531 --> 01:09:33.497
Tom Gould
doesn't meet on price.

01:09:33.631 --> 01:09:35.796
Tom Gould
doesn't meet on anything.

01:09:36.532 --> 01:09:38.196
The man's a bulldog.

01:09:39.332 --> 01:09:41.506
Oh, God, that's it,
that's that then, isn't it?

01:09:45.205 --> 01:09:47.037
Well, you're the one
who's always telling me

01:09:47.173 --> 01:09:50.116
- to stand up for myself.
- Yes. I know.

01:09:50.352 --> 01:09:52.352
So you should,
ordinarily, but...

01:09:53.817 --> 01:09:55.479
Look, it's up to you now.

01:09:55.681 --> 01:09:56.818
It's your show.

01:09:58.251 --> 01:10:00.525
I'm just the one
cheering from the sidelines.

01:10:02.262 --> 01:10:03.957
Oh, is that what that noise is?

01:10:35.197 --> 01:10:37.155
No sign of life.

01:10:48.734 --> 01:10:50.168
Oh, there it is!

01:10:51.046 --> 01:10:53.572
- Oh!
- Oh, God!

01:11:04.092 --> 01:11:05.425
What are you doing?

01:11:06.091 --> 01:11:07.295
Mum!

01:11:11.332 --> 01:11:13.130
This is breaking and entering.

01:11:13.265 --> 01:11:15.129
Oh, God.

01:11:15.331 --> 01:11:16.997
Help me.

01:11:17.399 --> 01:11:18.603
No!

01:11:21.034 --> 01:11:23.443
Oh, Devon!

01:11:24.772 --> 01:11:26.138
The back door was open.

01:11:27.080 --> 01:11:28.239
Country people.

01:11:33.788 --> 01:11:35.654
They're not gonna miss it.
They're not even using it.

01:11:36.624 --> 01:11:38.753
- What do you reckon? Yeah.
- It's stealing!

01:11:38.889 --> 01:11:41.361
- It's my dresser, pet.
- We sold it.

01:11:41.496 --> 01:11:44.156
- Shut up and help move it.
- Come on.

01:11:48.065 --> 01:11:49.766
Feels good, doesn't it?

01:11:51.540 --> 01:11:55.036
Okay, we should go.
Come on, let's go!

01:11:55.171 --> 01:11:57.107
Just hang on. I've just
got to check the windows.

01:11:57.243 --> 01:11:58.511
Back in a sec.

01:12:09.318 --> 01:12:11.125
You guys
have got to come and see this.

01:12:11.261 --> 01:12:13.152
- For God's sake! Devon!
- Just...

01:12:13.554 --> 01:12:14.725
Come on!

01:12:17.625 --> 01:12:18.793
Oh!

01:12:19.296 --> 01:12:24.031
Okay, Dev, yep, it's our paper.
We do sell the occasional roll.

01:12:26.537 --> 01:12:27.936
These are my books.

01:12:30.377 --> 01:12:32.380
And that's my coffee table.

01:12:34.841 --> 01:12:36.142
What is going on?

01:12:38.879 --> 01:12:40.388
We're in his house.

01:12:45.956 --> 01:12:48.187
I named this wallpaper
after him.

01:12:49.724 --> 01:12:50.959
Charlie Horse.

01:12:53.533 --> 01:12:55.062
It's what I used to call him.

01:12:58.439 --> 01:13:00.969
How did he even get my stuff?

01:13:02.976 --> 01:13:05.578
- We had a garage sale.
- Had a bit of a garage sale.

01:13:22.631 --> 01:13:26.733
<i>♪ Take me in your arms ♪</i>

01:13:26.869 --> 01:13:30.200
<i>♪ Thrill me
With all of your charms... ♪</i>

01:13:30.335 --> 01:13:31.472
Oh, my God.

01:13:33.641 --> 01:13:35.333
You used to play this
all the time.

01:13:38.773 --> 01:13:40.144
Now you know why.

01:13:43.613 --> 01:13:44.747
Oh, my God,

01:13:44.883 --> 01:13:47.554
I have never
seen you look so happy.

01:13:50.952 --> 01:13:52.658
Where do you think he is?

01:13:53.921 --> 01:13:55.285
Oh, God, we should go.

01:13:55.588 --> 01:13:57.894
- You don't want to see him?
- Absolutely not.

01:13:58.664 --> 01:14:01.426
Well... of course I do, but...

01:14:02.396 --> 01:14:04.435
I don't know that I want him
seeing me.

01:14:04.838 --> 01:14:06.769
- Oh, Mum.
- Look at me.

01:14:07.138 --> 01:14:09.301
Something tells me
he will take you as you are.

01:14:20.783 --> 01:14:22.116
Hey, it's still warm.

01:14:28.254 --> 01:14:30.124
- That's not him, is it?
- No.

01:14:31.662 --> 01:14:33.096
God, I hope not.

01:14:33.531 --> 01:14:35.129
- Hello.
- Hey!

01:14:35.264 --> 01:14:37.730
Excuse me! Excuse me.

01:14:37.865 --> 01:14:39.267
- Hello!
- Hi!

01:14:39.837 --> 01:14:41.839
I'm looking for Daniel.

01:14:41.974 --> 01:14:43.634
I don't suppose you know
where he is, do you?

01:14:44.437 --> 01:14:47.077
Um... he's a bit
of an old flame of mine.

01:14:47.980 --> 01:14:51.546
Oh. Well, you've probably
just missed him.

01:14:51.682 --> 01:14:52.884
He'll be working today.

01:14:53.019 --> 01:14:56.180
- Do you know where?
- In the city somewhere. Um,

01:14:56.416 --> 01:14:58.720
he catches a bus there
to go into town.

01:14:58.855 --> 01:15:00.824
He'll be probably catching, uh,

01:15:00.993 --> 01:15:03.322
- the 11.30, I'd say.
- That's ten minutes.

01:15:03.724 --> 01:15:06.127
If you'd left a few minutes ago,
you'd probably just catch him.

01:15:08.961 --> 01:15:10.032
Come on.

01:15:14.533 --> 01:15:16.433
Dev, come on!

01:15:16.569 --> 01:15:18.678
Shut up! I'm trying.

01:15:24.544 --> 01:15:26.552
Okay, my phone
says 12 minutes.

01:15:26.755 --> 01:15:28.319
- We've got seven.
- Yeah, well, your phone

01:15:28.521 --> 01:15:30.118
hasn't met Devon Wilton.

01:15:38.458 --> 01:15:39.997
- Which way? Come on.
- Um...

01:15:40.200 --> 01:15:42.232
- Come on, come on!
- Wait, wait, wait, wait!

01:15:42.534 --> 01:15:44.202
- Left...
- Left.

01:15:44.538 --> 01:15:45.896
- Most likely.
- Oh!

01:15:46.665 --> 01:15:48.235
- I think it's the left.
- Alright.

01:15:57.151 --> 01:15:58.245
Oh.

01:16:02.154 --> 01:16:03.421
I think it's just up here.
See where that Ute

01:16:03.557 --> 01:16:04.856
- is coming out?
- Yep.

01:16:06.193 --> 01:16:07.320
Mum?

01:16:08.858 --> 01:16:10.422
Mum, did you hear me?

01:16:12.862 --> 01:16:14.492
Did you hear me, Mum?

01:16:15.169 --> 01:16:16.333
Mum?

01:16:16.702 --> 01:16:18.502
I missed that. Sorry, pet.

01:16:18.771 --> 01:16:20.573
- Time check.
- Three minutes.

01:16:20.942 --> 01:16:24.437
- Yoo-hoo! You alright?
- Yeah, I'm alright. I just...

01:16:24.605 --> 01:16:27.971
I just got a bit distracted.

01:16:29.746 --> 01:16:31.080
Come on, Mum.

01:16:31.813 --> 01:16:32.983
Stop!

01:16:33.749 --> 01:16:36.254
Stop! Stop!

01:16:36.556 --> 01:16:38.285
Stop the fucking bus!

01:16:42.655 --> 01:16:45.600
- Okay, come on.
- You are a lunatic.

01:16:50.366 --> 01:16:52.401
Look, sorry, mate.
It's just two minutes.

01:16:52.536 --> 01:16:54.741
We're trying to find someone.
It's a bit of an emergency.

01:16:55.442 --> 01:16:57.073
Okay. Come on.

01:16:58.774 --> 01:16:59.977
You're alright.

01:17:01.073 --> 01:17:02.375
Thank you.

01:17:34.943 --> 01:17:36.244
You after a seat?

01:17:40.189 --> 01:17:41.579
Thank you.

01:17:51.662 --> 01:17:52.997
Okay?

01:17:54.865 --> 01:17:56.165
He wasn't there?

01:17:58.005 --> 01:18:00.004
I think I'd like to go home
now, please.

01:18:00.869 --> 01:18:02.534
Oh, Mum.

01:18:16.149 --> 01:18:17.652
I'm so sorry, Mum.

01:18:17.888 --> 01:18:19.991
No, that's alright.

01:18:21.391 --> 01:18:23.621
I wouldn't have known
what to say to him.

01:18:28.031 --> 01:18:29.399
So, Mum, I was just think...

01:18:29.568 --> 01:18:32.069
Well, Charelle and I were just
thinking that maybe after this

01:18:32.204 --> 01:18:34.670
you might like to come over
to our house

01:18:34.939 --> 01:18:36.537
for some food or whatever?

01:18:37.340 --> 01:18:39.538
Ginny and Kyle too,
if they want.

01:18:40.783 --> 01:18:42.717
- That would be lovely, Dev.
- Thanks.

01:18:45.554 --> 01:18:46.777
Can you see what this is?

01:18:46.913 --> 01:18:49.015
It's been buzzing against me
ever since we got in.

01:18:49.418 --> 01:18:51.390
Oh, oh, that's mine.

01:18:51.525 --> 01:18:53.255
- Oh.
- Hello?

01:18:54.021 --> 01:18:55.488
Oh, Tom, hi.

01:18:57.131 --> 01:18:59.767
Oh, yes, sorry about that.
June was on the phone.

01:19:02.768 --> 01:19:04.229
Oh, OK. Yeah, sure.

01:19:04.365 --> 01:19:07.335
Thanks.
You too, Tom. Bye.

01:19:12.614 --> 01:19:15.378
He met my price!

01:19:15.580 --> 01:19:17.312
Oh, pet!

01:19:18.249 --> 01:19:21.679
Oh, you! Aww!

01:19:22.282 --> 01:19:23.923
- Nice.
- Wow.

01:19:27.796 --> 01:19:29.790
- He met my price!
- Yeah, we heard.

01:19:31.593 --> 01:19:34.593
Tom Gould, suck it!

01:19:37.071 --> 01:19:39.301
I need to do a wee.
Can we stop?

01:19:52.452 --> 01:19:53.615
What?

01:19:53.984 --> 01:19:55.856
Oh, I don't know. You.

01:19:56.855 --> 01:19:58.151
I do worry about you.

01:19:58.287 --> 01:20:00.454
Well, don't, 'cause I'm fine.

01:20:02.396 --> 01:20:04.931
Mum, seriously, I haven't been
this good in a long time.

01:20:06.195 --> 01:20:07.725
You should meet Charelle.

01:20:08.470 --> 01:20:09.628
She's amazing.

01:20:12.871 --> 01:20:14.102
Dev, this accident...

01:20:14.338 --> 01:20:16.470
- Mum, leave it alone.
- Well, I can't.

01:20:18.513 --> 01:20:19.671
We should go.

01:20:21.312 --> 01:20:24.445
- I've got to get back.
- Devon. Please.

01:20:28.451 --> 01:20:29.617
If you don't wanna
talk about it,

01:20:29.786 --> 01:20:30.847
fine.

01:20:31.817 --> 01:20:33.619
But at least
let me give you a hug.

01:20:34.956 --> 01:20:35.995
Hmm?

01:20:38.762 --> 01:20:40.065
Hmm.

01:20:43.069 --> 01:20:44.901
- Oh, God.
- Who taught you to hug?

01:20:45.070 --> 01:20:47.006
You did.

01:20:48.301 --> 01:20:49.668
Alright, we done?

01:20:50.477 --> 01:20:51.472
No.

01:20:54.078 --> 01:20:55.540
Oh, pet, this isn't a hug.

01:20:55.675 --> 01:20:57.247
Alright, are we done now,
please?

01:20:58.320 --> 01:20:59.480
Mum.

01:21:00.347 --> 01:21:01.988
This is ridiculous.

01:21:04.653 --> 01:21:07.158
- Come on.
- Let the fuck go, please.

01:21:14.162 --> 01:21:15.694
Oh, darling.

01:21:21.534 --> 01:21:23.176
Oh.

01:21:23.545 --> 01:21:25.638
Oh, darling. Dev.

01:21:29.276 --> 01:21:30.742
I'm so sorry.

01:21:32.712 --> 01:21:34.947
- I didn't even see him.
- I know.

01:21:35.650 --> 01:21:37.650
- I didn't see him.
- I know.

01:21:38.417 --> 01:21:39.817
I didn't see him.

01:22:00.414 --> 01:22:02.715
- Just chop them.
- Well, tell Picasso

01:22:02.850 --> 01:22:04.518
to hurry up and finish painting.

01:22:08.116 --> 01:22:09.385
You made it.

01:22:10.757 --> 01:22:12.025
Lovely place.

01:22:12.995 --> 01:22:15.127
Stop it. Come here.

01:22:18.326 --> 01:22:19.593
Come and meet Charelle.

01:22:20.292 --> 01:22:21.529
Alright.

01:22:23.572 --> 01:22:26.064
So, Mum, Charelle.

01:22:26.967 --> 01:22:31.742
Oh, June, it is so lovely
to finally meet you.

01:22:32.077 --> 01:22:33.772
And you.

01:22:34.974 --> 01:22:36.781
And my sister Ginny, of course.
Charelle.

01:22:36.917 --> 01:22:38.249
- Hello.
- Oh, hello.

01:22:38.585 --> 01:22:39.710
Hi.

01:22:39.946 --> 01:22:42.352
So grumpy.

01:22:43.891 --> 01:22:45.483
What's the matter with you two?

01:22:45.619 --> 01:22:48.655
Mum took our iPads away.

01:22:50.099 --> 01:22:52.093
Oh, there you are.

01:22:52.496 --> 01:22:54.592
- Mum, I got you a chardonnay.
- Oh,

01:22:54.827 --> 01:22:56.795
- I'll just pop to the bathroom.
- Okay.

01:23:01.742 --> 01:23:02.834
Thanks, mate.

01:23:04.739 --> 01:23:07.344
How's things?

01:23:08.473 --> 01:23:10.017
Um, what's that?

01:23:11.352 --> 01:23:15.022
- Just wondering how things are.
- Oh. Yeah, you know.

01:23:17.156 --> 01:23:19.994
- You?
- Yeah, no. Things are...

01:23:22.588 --> 01:23:24.460
definitely very good.

01:23:25.061 --> 01:23:26.363
That's good.

01:23:32.765 --> 01:23:34.332
- Just one sec, mate.
- Yeah.

01:23:34.701 --> 01:23:36.542
- Hey, buddy.
- Hi, Dad.

01:23:37.211 --> 01:23:38.870
- Hey, have you got a second?
- Yeah.

01:23:39.614 --> 01:23:41.081
Come here.

01:23:49.352 --> 01:23:51.784
Yeah!

01:23:56.329 --> 01:23:59.258
Stop it! No!

01:24:01.232 --> 01:24:02.696
No, no, no, this way.

01:24:03.731 --> 01:24:05.096
Hey,
where'd your mum go?

01:24:05.232 --> 01:24:08.042
Huh, Mum. She should be
in the bathroom, I think.

01:24:10.369 --> 01:24:11.507
Oh.

01:24:23.886 --> 01:24:25.783
You don't have
to look so worried.

01:24:25.919 --> 01:24:27.853
- You're not in trouble.
- What's up?

01:24:29.695 --> 01:24:32.060
Listen, I just wanted to say
I was speaking to Mum,

01:24:32.228 --> 01:24:35.102
my mum, and, um...

01:24:37.865 --> 01:24:39.931
I realized
I'd never spoken to you...

01:24:41.876 --> 01:24:43.137
about the accident.

01:24:43.539 --> 01:24:45.442
- Dad.
- I just wanted to say...

01:24:47.578 --> 01:24:50.150
that, in case
you don't know...

01:24:57.859 --> 01:24:59.456
I really am sorry...

01:25:01.489 --> 01:25:02.954
for what I did to you.

01:25:06.568 --> 01:25:07.629
What?

01:25:10.169 --> 01:25:11.600
I know you're sorry, Dad.

01:25:13.471 --> 01:25:14.933
I've always known
you were sorry.

01:25:15.811 --> 01:25:18.477
I just...

01:25:19.447 --> 01:25:21.577
don't understand why
you stopped talking to me.

01:25:24.982 --> 01:25:26.076
What?

01:25:29.352 --> 01:25:31.081
You don't even realize.

01:25:32.325 --> 01:25:34.458
You hardly even look at me
anymore.

01:25:41.369 --> 01:25:43.929
Oh, mate, come here,
come here, come here.

01:26:06.120 --> 01:26:09.258
Tomato sauce. Really?
Mum's going to love that.

01:26:09.561 --> 01:26:11.294
- Can you get rid of these?
- What?

01:26:11.563 --> 01:26:13.464
Quickly, please,
before she comes back.

01:26:14.669 --> 01:26:16.093
Okay.

01:26:22.542 --> 01:26:24.372
Apparently,
our illustrious matriarch

01:26:24.507 --> 01:26:25.971
will think they're uncivilized.

01:26:26.340 --> 01:26:27.544
Okay.

01:26:31.543 --> 01:26:34.985
Here we go, guys. Lasagna.
In Italy they call it "lunch".

01:26:35.154 --> 01:26:36.384
- Dev.
- Yes?

01:26:36.953 --> 01:26:39.523
Oh, I'll take those,
but I want a kiss as well.

01:26:46.430 --> 01:26:48.231
Thank you. Alright. Here we go.

01:26:48.366 --> 01:26:50.331
Alright, everyone. Grab a seat.

01:26:50.667 --> 01:26:52.466
- Kids.
- Sit down, guys.

01:26:52.602 --> 01:26:53.801
- Come on, boys.
- Come on.

01:26:54.436 --> 01:26:55.974
Come on. Quickly.

01:26:56.543 --> 01:26:58.135
Can I have some salt,
if you don't mind?

01:26:59.175 --> 01:27:00.544
Good.

01:27:03.343 --> 01:27:05.978
Well, I think we're gonna need
tomato sauce, aren't we?

01:27:14.924 --> 01:27:17.462
I'd like to say well done
to the hostess.

01:27:18.198 --> 01:27:19.725
Clearly a valuable addition

01:27:19.861 --> 01:27:21.396
- to the Wilton family.
- Yes.

01:27:21.698 --> 01:27:23.370
- You're a lucky boy, Devon.
- I am.

01:27:23.772 --> 01:27:25.096
To Tiffany.

01:27:28.438 --> 01:27:29.705
That's Charelle, Mum.

01:27:31.380 --> 01:27:33.436
- That's why I said Charelle.
- Sure, yep.

01:27:33.772 --> 01:27:35.045
It's alright.

01:27:37.417 --> 01:27:39.110
Alright, everyone,
let me know

01:27:39.246 --> 01:27:40.813
if your lasagna's
still cold in the middle.

01:27:40.948 --> 01:27:42.883
I'll pop it back
in the microwave.

01:27:44.650 --> 01:27:45.749
Okay.

01:27:46.119 --> 01:27:48.822
- Alright. Here we go.
- Great.

01:27:48.958 --> 01:27:50.426
I'm gonna put some salt.
Anyone want salt?

01:27:50.628 --> 01:27:52.426
- Oh, no.
- No, thanks.

01:27:52.561 --> 01:27:54.092
You want some of this?

01:27:56.065 --> 01:27:58.901
Hey, we should get
a family photo after this.

01:27:59.737 --> 01:28:01.604
Yeah, I think
that's a great idea.

01:28:01.739 --> 01:28:02.770
- It'd be nice.
- Yeah.

01:28:02.906 --> 01:28:04.443
Would you like
some salad, June?

01:28:05.439 --> 01:28:06.511
Hmm?

01:28:07.983 --> 01:28:09.613
No, I don't think so.

01:28:10.514 --> 01:28:12.351
Well, I will. More for me.

01:28:12.487 --> 01:28:14.145
- It's a good one that one.
- Bacon bits?

01:28:18.285 --> 01:28:20.284
Do we really have to have this
on the table?

01:28:20.520 --> 01:28:23.627
Can people not go one meal
without dousing it in the stuff?

01:28:25.163 --> 01:28:26.795
Mate, it's fine.

01:28:29.767 --> 01:28:31.662
Well, eat up, everybody.
I didn't make it

01:28:31.831 --> 01:28:33.098
to go cold.

01:28:39.640 --> 01:28:41.073
Are you okay, Mum?

01:28:44.984 --> 01:28:46.243
Mum?

01:28:49.153 --> 01:28:50.357
June?

01:28:58.823 --> 01:29:01.258
Mum. It's Devon.

01:29:03.862 --> 01:29:05.262
You know who I am?

01:29:07.271 --> 01:29:08.507
Of course.

01:29:26.825 --> 01:29:28.428
I think we'd better get back
to the home.

01:29:31.062 --> 01:29:33.061
Mum, we're going to take you
back to the home now.

01:29:33.196 --> 01:29:35.600
Can we just... Please,
just let her finish her lunch.

01:29:52.748 --> 01:29:54.283
Right, let's go then, okay?

01:29:54.419 --> 01:29:55.646
We didn't get the shot.

01:29:55.781 --> 01:29:56.882
Are you serious?

01:29:57.085 --> 01:29:59.549
It's important.
It'll take five seconds.

01:29:59.718 --> 01:30:02.891
Okay, guys? Come over here
and we'll get a photo with Nan.

01:30:04.229 --> 01:30:05.432
Here we go.

01:30:07.568 --> 01:30:10.533
Gather around.
Okay. Get in this way.

01:30:10.802 --> 01:30:12.401
Everyone make sure
they can be seen.

01:30:12.537 --> 01:30:15.167
There we go.
Alright.

01:30:16.001 --> 01:30:17.741
Mum? Look at the phone.

01:30:18.873 --> 01:30:20.073
Just look at the phone, Mum.

01:30:20.642 --> 01:30:21.879
There you go.

01:30:22.214 --> 01:30:24.275
Three, two, one.

01:30:30.383 --> 01:30:32.624
Let's go inside.

01:30:53.372 --> 01:30:55.779
I'm very glad to see you back,
my dear.

01:30:56.415 --> 01:30:58.074
I was getting worried.

01:30:58.643 --> 01:31:00.817
I think that's the first time
in all these years

01:31:01.850 --> 01:31:03.622
we've missed our cup of tea.

01:31:11.266 --> 01:31:14.061
Ugly thing, isn't it? Huh!

01:31:16.664 --> 01:31:17.966
I think...

01:31:19.231 --> 01:31:21.299
those were your exact words...

01:31:24.278 --> 01:31:25.941
when I gave it to you.

01:31:29.778 --> 01:31:31.309
You gave it, did you?

01:31:38.355 --> 01:31:39.350
June?

01:31:41.556 --> 01:31:42.694
Junie.

01:31:43.989 --> 01:31:45.631
Please, June.

01:31:49.103 --> 01:31:50.504
It's Danny.

01:31:59.871 --> 01:32:00.976
June.

01:32:04.645 --> 01:32:05.750
Oh.

01:32:07.219 --> 01:32:08.478
Oh.

01:32:17.222 --> 01:32:19.126
Isn't this an adventure...

01:32:21.532 --> 01:32:23.064
Charlie Horse.
