00:04.572 --> 00:07.675
Sad news from Miami
as Hurricane Jasmine Forsythe

00:07.708 --> 00:09.810
has claimed the life
of LeBron James

00:09.843 --> 00:11.512
of the Miami Heat.

00:11.545 --> 00:14.215
Mr. James was swept away
by the storm surge

00:14.248 --> 00:18.219
that destroyed 90% of the
Florida peninsula last night.

00:18.252 --> 00:22.022
Once again, we're reporting
the sad death of LeBron James,

00:22.056 --> 00:24.258
and the rest
of the Miami Heat,

00:24.292 --> 00:26.026
and 12 million other people.

00:26.060 --> 00:30.664
** (down-tempo music)

00:30.698 --> 00:32.066
(Louie)
My daughter asked me
that question,

00:32.100 --> 00:34.001
uh, what came first,
the chicken or the egg?

00:34.034 --> 00:36.104
That's supposed to be a very
perplexing question.

00:36.137 --> 00:37.571
What came first,
the chicken or the egg?

00:37.605 --> 00:38.906
It's really easy--
it's the egg.

00:38.939 --> 00:40.408
Of course, it is,

00:40.441 --> 00:42.343
because you can't
just make a chicken.

00:42.376 --> 00:44.212
You can't just have chicken.

00:44.245 --> 00:46.114
You can't go, "Chicken".

00:46.147 --> 00:47.581
You need to start
with an egg,

00:47.615 --> 00:50.384
and it starts this tiny,
and a chicken grows.

00:50.418 --> 00:52.453
Now, a lot of people try to be,
you know, wiseguys,

00:52.486 --> 00:53.854
and they go, "Well, okay,

00:53.887 --> 00:56.757
so then where did the egg
come from?"

00:56.790 --> 00:59.893
Uh, it came out
of a chicken, you idiot.

00:59.927 --> 01:02.496
It came out of
a chicken's ass.

01:06.934 --> 01:09.203
How are you?

01:09.237 --> 01:10.704
You here with Louie?

01:10.738 --> 01:12.273
Mm-hmm.

01:12.306 --> 01:14.308
You don't speak English, right?
No English?

01:14.342 --> 01:15.776
Hm?
No English?

01:15.809 --> 01:17.311
No English, no, no.

01:17.345 --> 01:18.612
Right.

01:18.646 --> 01:21.782
So... my cock
is seven feet long,

01:21.815 --> 01:24.952
and it stinks.

01:24.985 --> 01:26.420
(laughs)

01:26.454 --> 01:28.589
(speaking Hungarian)

01:28.622 --> 01:30.424
(Louie)
Now, I don't know if
you understand the logistics

01:30.458 --> 01:33.561
of a hay bale
in New York City.

01:33.594 --> 01:36.497
Somebody went
and got a hay bale...

01:36.530 --> 01:41.269
** (up-tempo jazz)

01:41.302 --> 01:43.404
Nick, are you gonna
order something?

01:43.437 --> 01:47.508
Yeah, I'll have the fried
reindeer feet.

01:47.541 --> 01:49.410
(sighs)
We don't have reindeer feet.

01:49.443 --> 01:51.345
Okay, then I'll just
have the sherbert.

01:51.379 --> 01:52.846
Hey, you got it
figured out, Louie.

01:52.880 --> 01:55.983
I mean, she seems really cool,
and she's cute.

01:56.016 --> 01:57.751
She is--
she's growing on me.

01:57.785 --> 01:59.086
(Todd)
AIDS.

01:59.119 --> 02:00.621
So she's leaving for good
in a week?

02:00.654 --> 02:02.690
Yeah, she's gonna be going--
that's it.

02:02.723 --> 02:04.258
Then, you're gonna
be lonely.

02:04.292 --> 02:06.994
More or less, yeah,
that's the thing.

02:07.027 --> 02:08.362
You guys have never said
a word to each other,

02:08.396 --> 02:09.663
and you're having
a great time.

02:09.697 --> 02:11.265
And then, she'll leave,

02:11.299 --> 02:13.601
and you'll be depressed
and lonely.
Uh-huh.

02:13.634 --> 02:16.437
You know how much shit you're
skipping in-between there?

02:16.470 --> 02:18.038
Getting to know her?

02:18.071 --> 02:19.173
Getting sick of her?

02:19.207 --> 02:20.841
Not being able
to leave her

02:20.874 --> 02:23.110
because you have
low self-esteem.

02:23.143 --> 02:25.379
Realizing that
she's sick of you.

02:25.413 --> 02:28.216
Trying to fix it by
getting married.

02:28.249 --> 02:30.284
Trying to fix
the marriage by having kids.

02:30.318 --> 02:32.953
Culling together
a few radio spots

02:32.986 --> 02:34.888
so you have an excuse
to come into New York

02:34.922 --> 02:37.191
just to get away
from her and the kids.

02:37.225 --> 02:39.059
Ah, we're talking
about you now.

02:39.092 --> 02:41.229
You're afraid of being lonely.

02:41.262 --> 02:44.064
You know how much I dream
of being lonely?

02:44.097 --> 02:46.867
I love my wife,
love my kids,

02:46.900 --> 02:52.139
but, holy shit, lonely
sounds like paradise to me.

02:52.172 --> 02:53.541
AIDS.

02:53.574 --> 02:56.076
Please-- have your fun now.

02:56.109 --> 02:57.645
Feel bad later.

02:57.678 --> 03:00.147
I mean, it's
a zero-sum game.

03:00.180 --> 03:02.149
AIDS.

03:02.182 --> 03:03.517
I know what you mean--
I mean,

03:03.551 --> 03:05.018
I only get
the kids half the week,

03:05.052 --> 03:06.720
and I still-- I wanna
be alone all the time.

03:06.754 --> 03:08.021
It's just too much.

03:08.055 --> 03:09.590
AIDS.

03:09.623 --> 03:11.492
My youngest is having trouble
in school now too.

03:11.525 --> 03:12.726
(Singing to
"Smoke on the Water" melody)

03:12.760 --> 03:13.894
* AIDS, AIDS, AIDS

03:13.927 --> 03:15.996
* AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS

03:16.029 --> 03:19.767
* AIDS, AIDS, AIDS,
AIDS, AIDS *

03:19.800 --> 03:21.735
* AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS--

03:21.769 --> 03:23.170
Todd!

03:23.203 --> 03:24.738
Jesus Christ, Todd.

03:24.772 --> 03:26.073
AIDS.

03:26.106 --> 03:27.875
AIDS?

03:27.908 --> 03:30.511
Stop talking about
your boring-ass lives

03:30.544 --> 03:32.346
and your dumb kids.

03:32.380 --> 03:33.714
Todd, how old are you?

03:33.747 --> 03:35.015
49.

03:35.048 --> 03:36.384
(both laugh)

03:36.417 --> 03:40.220
Todd, you're
a 49-year-old single comedian.

03:40.254 --> 03:41.522
Can I ask you
a question?

03:41.555 --> 03:43.023
Mm?

03:43.056 --> 03:44.358
What do you do
all day?

03:44.392 --> 03:46.427
That's a great question.

03:46.460 --> 03:48.061
Oh, when I'm not tag-teaming
both of your moms?

03:48.095 --> 03:49.430
Yeah, when
you're not doing that.

03:49.463 --> 03:51.532
No, I wanna know
because Louie and I have kids.

03:51.565 --> 03:52.766
We're raising children.

03:52.800 --> 03:54.535
What do you do?

03:54.568 --> 03:56.370
What-- what is your day?

03:56.404 --> 03:58.606
Walk me through any day.

03:58.639 --> 03:59.873
All right,
how about yesterday?

03:59.907 --> 04:01.975
Sure.
Yesterday was great.

04:02.009 --> 04:04.278
Okay, what time
did you get up?

04:04.312 --> 04:05.546
10:00, 10:30?

04:05.579 --> 04:09.617
Okay, 10:00--
take me through all of it.

04:09.650 --> 04:12.219
Woke up, uh, hung out
in bed a little bit.

04:12.252 --> 04:13.587
Got the iPad out.

04:13.621 --> 04:15.656
** (lounge music)

04:15.689 --> 04:17.291
Catch up on
a little Facebooking,

04:17.325 --> 04:19.059
a little Twitter, and, uh...

04:19.092 --> 04:21.128
boom, time for breakfast.

04:21.161 --> 04:22.730
What's for breakfast?

04:22.763 --> 04:25.433
Every day, I go to the diner
downstairs from me.

04:25.466 --> 04:27.901
I have toast,
well-done bacon,

04:27.935 --> 04:31.405
coffee, juice.

04:31.439 --> 04:34.442
But if this one waitress
is working,

04:34.475 --> 04:36.744
I also get a free donut.

04:36.777 --> 04:38.346
(Greg)
Really?
Yeah.

04:38.379 --> 04:40.414
Started a couple years ago
when she said...

04:40.448 --> 04:43.016
Hey, you're in here,
like, every day.

04:46.620 --> 04:48.155
Do you want a donut?

04:50.358 --> 04:53.427
Boom, free donut every time
she's there.

04:53.461 --> 04:54.762
(Greg)
Nice.

04:54.795 --> 04:56.129
Okay, what next?

04:56.163 --> 04:57.431
Then, I went
to the doctor.

04:57.465 --> 04:59.099
Why? What do you got?

04:59.132 --> 05:00.934
It was just sniffles,
or allergies, or something,

05:00.968 --> 05:02.536
but I-- I don't wanna
deal with that.

05:02.570 --> 05:03.937
So I go to a clinic.

05:03.971 --> 05:05.105
A clinic?

05:05.138 --> 05:06.974
Yeah-- Urgent Care, baby.

05:07.007 --> 05:09.777
Storefront, open late,
40-minute wait.

05:09.810 --> 05:11.612
Brought my iPad.

05:11.645 --> 05:14.348
Using the Wi-Fi
from the coffee shop next door.

05:14.382 --> 05:16.450
No need to dip
into my data plan.

05:16.484 --> 05:18.619
(woman)
Todd Barry?

05:18.652 --> 05:20.153
Boom, it's my turn.

05:20.187 --> 05:21.655
Todd Barry is next.

05:23.891 --> 05:24.958
What happened next?

05:24.992 --> 05:27.227
Lunch.
Where?

05:27.260 --> 05:28.829
Oh, this was sweet.

05:28.862 --> 05:30.297
I reach into my wallet

05:30.330 --> 05:33.133
to get out my Setagaya Ramen
punch card.

05:33.166 --> 05:35.035
I count the punches-- ten.

05:35.068 --> 05:36.404
You know what that means?

05:36.437 --> 05:39.306
I qualify for a free bowl
of ramen--

05:39.339 --> 05:42.175
pork or beef.

05:42.209 --> 05:43.911
(Nick)
What'd you do after lunch?

05:43.944 --> 05:45.513
I had to work off
the pork.

05:45.546 --> 05:46.680
Went to the gym.

05:46.714 --> 05:48.348
You belong to a gym?

05:48.382 --> 05:50.250
I belong to gyms.

05:50.283 --> 05:51.485
Gyms.

05:51.519 --> 05:53.353
You mean plural?

05:53.387 --> 05:56.724
I have all-access to every
Synergy Gym below 14th Street.

05:56.757 --> 05:58.559
Sounds expensive.

05:58.592 --> 06:00.193
Not when
you cash in 290,000

06:00.227 --> 06:01.862
American Express points,
it isn't.

06:01.895 --> 06:03.564
So you went
to the gym.

06:03.597 --> 06:06.366
Go to the gym, get on
the treadmill for ten minutes.

06:06.400 --> 06:08.201
Then, I get on the bike
for ten minutes.

06:08.235 --> 06:11.171
Went home,
took a well-deserved nap.

06:11.204 --> 06:12.840
Then, I woke up.

06:12.873 --> 06:14.742
Then, I had to race off
to my gig in Poughkeepsie.

06:14.775 --> 06:16.343
You had a gig?

06:16.376 --> 06:19.713
Yeah, Poughkeepsie,
booked myself seven months ago.

06:19.747 --> 06:23.751
Did a great deal--
80% of the door, $10 ticket.

06:23.784 --> 06:26.454
I get 80%,
he gets 20%.

06:26.487 --> 06:28.088
So then, I have to get
to the gig.

06:28.121 --> 06:30.558
Do you know how much a train
to Poughkeepsie costs?

06:30.591 --> 06:33.226
$40.
Exactly.

06:33.260 --> 06:36.229
Do you know how much a Greyhound
bus to Poughkeepsie costs?

06:36.263 --> 06:38.231
$20.

06:38.265 --> 06:40.367
Do you know how much
a Chinatown bus

06:40.400 --> 06:41.935
that goes to Croton-Harmon,

06:41.969 --> 06:45.072
which is just 20 minutes
outside of Poughkeepsie, is?

06:45.105 --> 06:46.774
8.50.

06:46.807 --> 06:50.110
I sell one ticket,
I cover most of that.

06:50.143 --> 06:52.245
So I took the bus
to Croton-Harmon.

06:52.279 --> 06:53.881
I get there,
I call the owner, and I say,

06:53.914 --> 06:55.583
"Hey, can you come
pick me up?"

06:55.616 --> 06:57.050
Croton?

06:57.084 --> 06:58.452
He says something about,

06:58.486 --> 07:00.754
"Oh, that's a huge pain
in the butt,

07:00.788 --> 07:03.390
and also, we never
talked about this before."

07:03.423 --> 07:06.093
I go, "Yeah, you're right,
we never did talk about it.

07:06.126 --> 07:08.128
"But if you want me
to do the show,

07:08.161 --> 07:10.631
I need
to get to the club."

07:10.664 --> 07:13.100
Boom, I get the ride.

07:13.133 --> 07:15.168
(exhales)

07:17.170 --> 07:19.106
So I get to the club...

07:19.139 --> 07:21.942
(woman)
Can I get Three Miller Lites,
two Long Islands...

07:21.975 --> 07:23.511
I take a peek
at the crowd.

07:28.148 --> 07:29.449
I ask the waitress
for a Coke.

07:29.483 --> 07:30.984
Coke, please?

07:33.153 --> 07:35.088
She gives me a Coke
for free.

07:35.122 --> 07:37.758
Ah, Coke.

07:37.791 --> 07:41.028
I walk towards
the dressing room...

07:41.061 --> 07:44.632
and I see a piece of paper
on the dressing room door.

07:44.665 --> 07:45.999
And you know
what it says?

07:46.033 --> 07:48.435
It says "Todd Berry"...

07:48.468 --> 07:50.003
with an "E",

07:50.037 --> 07:51.972
not Todd Barry with an "A",

07:52.005 --> 07:53.807
which is how
I spell my name.

07:53.841 --> 07:55.275
They spelled it wrong.

07:55.308 --> 07:57.645
Now, I could've
let that go.

07:57.678 --> 08:00.514
I mean, it's just
a dressing room sign, right?

08:00.548 --> 08:02.916
Everyone makes mistakes, right?

08:04.518 --> 08:06.219
I go to the owner.

08:06.253 --> 08:08.155
I say, "Hey,
I don't mean to be a dick,

08:08.188 --> 08:11.525
but my name is Todd Barry
with an "A".

08:11.559 --> 08:14.995
My dressing room sign
says "Todd Berry" with an "E".

08:16.530 --> 08:19.733
And he gives me a look,
like, "So?"

08:19.767 --> 08:22.369
And I go, "I know it's kind of
a pain in the ass,

08:22.402 --> 08:23.971
"but I don't ask for much.

08:24.004 --> 08:26.373
"And yes, I know
it's an easy mistake to make,

08:26.406 --> 08:29.843
"but it's also an easy
mistake to fix,

08:29.877 --> 08:32.813
and it's very
important to me."

08:32.846 --> 08:35.182
So I said,
"All you gotta do

08:35.215 --> 08:37.551
"is take the sign down,

08:37.585 --> 08:41.054
"put it in a responsible place
for refuse,

08:41.088 --> 08:42.856
"walk over to the computer,

08:42.890 --> 08:46.059
"log onto Microsoft Word,
or Apple Text,

08:46.093 --> 08:47.595
"whatever you want,

08:47.628 --> 08:50.363
"Type in Todd Barry
with an "A",

What'd he say?

09:01.709 --> 09:04.044
Oh, it's not
what he said.

It's what he did.

Hey... Evanka.

Evanka.

Evanka-- oh, shit.

Oh, shit.

What-- what? What is it?

10:46.747 --> 10:48.115
You need to help me.

10:48.148 --> 10:49.382
What-- you can't
just come barging in.

10:49.416 --> 10:51.051
This is my home as well
as my office.

10:51.084 --> 10:52.619
What are you doing?
This lady needs your help.

10:52.652 --> 10:54.121
This woman needs your help.

10:54.154 --> 10:56.890
Well-- I have boundaries!

10:56.924 --> 10:58.225
What if she's dead?

10:58.258 --> 10:59.626
Then, you won't
have any problems.

10:59.659 --> 11:01.628
This isn't 9-1-1-- call 9-1-1.

11:01.661 --> 11:04.564
Come on! Please, look!
Oh, geez.

11:04.597 --> 11:06.666
Oh.
She was lying on the floor
of the elevator.

11:06.700 --> 11:08.068
All right, all right.

11:08.101 --> 11:10.037
She's a nice--
she's unconscious.

11:10.070 --> 11:11.872
Get around the other side.

11:11.905 --> 11:13.406
Move her against the wall.

11:13.440 --> 11:15.809
Move her-- move her forward
against the wall.

11:15.843 --> 11:18.078
Now, now,
p-- p-- pat her back.

11:18.111 --> 11:19.346
Hit her on the back,
hit her on the back,

11:19.379 --> 11:20.647
hit her on the back.

11:20.680 --> 11:23.150
(Evanka coughing)

11:23.183 --> 11:24.752
Ah! Ah.
(coughing)

11:24.785 --> 11:27.755
Sweetie, sweetie, you've got
to chew these Mentos.

11:27.788 --> 11:29.890
They're perfect plugs
for the esophagus.

11:29.923 --> 11:31.491
You've got
to chew them, sweetie.

11:31.524 --> 11:32.726
You'll be all right.

11:32.760 --> 11:34.694
Help her up--
help her up.

11:34.728 --> 11:36.096
Here you go--
help her up.

11:36.129 --> 11:38.098
Oh, I'm so sorry--
I'm so sorry.

11:38.131 --> 11:39.666
It's all right,
you're gonna be fine.

11:39.699 --> 11:41.001
I'm very embarrassed.

11:41.034 --> 11:42.435
What happened?

11:42.469 --> 11:44.271
I found you on the floor
of the elevator,

11:44.304 --> 11:46.006
and I brought you
to the doctor.

11:46.039 --> 11:47.741
That damn elevator--
I'm gonna die there one day.

11:47.775 --> 11:51.178
You know, it's a--
interesting statistics.

11:51.211 --> 11:54.848
Only two people per decade
die in elevators.

11:54.882 --> 11:56.183
Is that right?

11:56.216 --> 11:58.085
That's considered
a very clean

11:58.118 --> 11:59.686
and sterile environment, yes.

11:59.719 --> 12:04.124
Well, this one is a--
is an evil box of death.

12:04.157 --> 12:07.427
I'd rather be back riding
in the caboose

12:07.460 --> 12:09.729
of Jackie Gleason's train.

12:09.763 --> 12:11.364
You knew Gleason?

12:11.398 --> 12:12.866
Oh, knew him?

12:12.900 --> 12:14.434
He and-- well, never mind.

12:14.467 --> 12:15.635
Please don't make me
tell you.

12:15.668 --> 12:17.670
No, no, tell--
it sounds great.

12:19.239 --> 12:20.540
You come see me--

12:20.573 --> 12:22.242
you come see me
if you have any problems.

12:22.275 --> 12:24.311
You're gonna be just fine--
you're gonna be just fine.

12:24.344 --> 12:26.479
Oh, thank you
very much, doctor.

12:26.513 --> 12:27.881
Thank you.
Yes, yes, surely, yes.

12:27.915 --> 12:29.749
Thank you.
Yes.

12:29.783 --> 12:31.118
Oh.
You all right?

12:31.151 --> 12:32.953
Yeah.

12:32.986 --> 12:34.554
What-- what was I doing?

12:34.587 --> 12:36.756
Was I coming, or--
You were just laying
on the floor.

12:36.790 --> 12:38.926
No, but before-- was I going
out, or was I coming home?

12:38.959 --> 12:41.561
I don't know--
I wasn't there for that part.

12:41.594 --> 12:44.431
Look, maybe just-- let me take
you back upstairs, all right?

12:44.464 --> 12:46.433
I'll help you.
That's probably a good idea.

12:46.466 --> 12:49.436
Right?
Thank you.

12:49.469 --> 12:51.238
Oh, you know what?

12:51.271 --> 12:53.240
What-- you don't wanna
take the elevator, right?

12:53.273 --> 12:55.575
No, I don't wanna
take that elevator.

12:55.608 --> 12:58.445
Come on-- you all right?
Oh, yeah.

12:58.478 --> 12:59.947
You like Mentos?

12:59.980 --> 13:01.748
I have no more Mentos.
No? Okay.

13:01.781 --> 13:03.016
You're a good guy,
you know that?

13:03.050 --> 13:04.317
Ah, I'm all right.

13:04.351 --> 13:06.419
Yeah, yeah--
you saved my life.

13:06.453 --> 13:08.655
Nah, what are you--
you don't-- ah.

13:08.688 --> 13:10.457
You know what they say?
What do they say?

13:10.490 --> 13:12.960
(Evanka speaks indistinctly)

13:14.194 --> 13:16.263
Okay.

13:16.296 --> 13:18.465
You all right now?
Yeah, thank you so much.

13:18.498 --> 13:19.967
Okay, be-- you know.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.501
I'm gonna take a nap.

13:21.534 --> 13:23.103
Well, be-- do it
carefully, okay?

13:23.136 --> 13:24.171
Don't, uh...

13:24.204 --> 13:28.341
Um... you and, uh, Amia,

13:28.375 --> 13:29.877
you've never...

13:29.910 --> 13:32.312
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah?

13:32.345 --> 13:35.849
Well, do you-- I mean...

13:35.883 --> 13:38.751
What I want to ask is--
is it serious?

13:40.553 --> 13:43.023
Uh...

13:43.056 --> 13:44.992
You mean, the--

13:45.025 --> 13:47.627
okay, I-- I-- I---
I feel like--

13:47.660 --> 13:49.229
No, no, no.

13:49.262 --> 13:51.731
Is it serious?

13:51.764 --> 13:53.700
Oh, I don't--

13:53.733 --> 13:54.968
I don't know
if we should--

13:55.002 --> 13:56.904
All right,
I'll take that as a no.

13:56.937 --> 13:59.139
Okay, just checking.

13:59.172 --> 14:02.175
Well, no, it's--
No, I just wanted to know--
that's all right.

14:02.209 --> 14:04.211
I-- no, it's serious to me.

14:04.244 --> 14:06.746
I...

14:06.779 --> 14:08.381
No, look.

14:08.415 --> 14:10.583
This is serious.

14:10.617 --> 14:12.986
The other thing--
"I love you so much,

14:13.020 --> 14:14.587
you're so beautiful"-- no.

14:14.621 --> 14:17.190
That's nice, but... no.

14:18.625 --> 14:20.027
All right.

14:20.060 --> 14:25.098
You know, in Hungary,
we have a saying.

14:25.132 --> 14:28.768
"If you didn't screw the cow,
she's not your cow."

14:30.403 --> 14:33.073
I'm not sure
that's how that goes.

14:33.106 --> 14:34.241
That's...

14:34.274 --> 14:35.608
You're a nice boy.

14:35.642 --> 14:38.045
You know, you stay
just as you are, yeah?

14:38.078 --> 14:39.947
You saved my life
two times,

14:39.980 --> 14:43.383
so you stay
just as you are.

14:43.416 --> 14:45.718
Okay.
Okay.

14:45.752 --> 14:47.054
Bye-bye.

14:50.423 --> 14:53.293
Oh, this new lock,
I don't even know how it works.

What's the matter
with that-- okay.

Oh, my God, shut up--
