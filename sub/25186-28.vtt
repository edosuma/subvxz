<font color="#00FFFF">Yeah. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> No, that's not what I meant.</font>

04:19.959 --> 04:23.959

<font color="#00FFFF">have been in here,</font>

04:29.196 --> 04:31.195
<font color="#00FFFF">because I fancy Josh and I see a</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">future with Josh.</font>

04:31.196 --> 04:33.195
<font color="#00FFFF">Why has he not been loyal to me?</font>

04:33.196 --> 04:38.195
<font color="#00FFFF">Why is he going like this on a bed</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">with a girl that looks similar to</font>

04:39.556 --> 04:45.235

<font color="#00FFFF">into a psychopath. I have turned</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">into a psychopath!</font>

04:45.236 --> 04:48.715
<font color="#11FF11">It doesn't look great, admittedly.</font>

04:48.716 --> 04:52.195
<font color="#00FFFF">No, it doesn't look great!</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Of course it doesn't look great!</font>

04:52.196 --> 04:55.195
<font color="#11FF11">But-but-but... You don't know. It's</font>
<font color="#11FF11">boys around boys. Doing dumb shit.</font>

04:55.196 --> 04:58.195
<font color="#FFFF00">You thought Jordan was hot.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Yeah, but I wasn't thrusting, was I?</font>

04:58.196 --> 05:00.195
<font color="#FFFF00">But he's a boy!</font>

05:00.196 --> 05:02.195
<font color="#11FF11">We just do dumb shit when we're</font>
<font color="#11FF11">around each other.</font>

05:02.196 --> 05:04.195
<font color="#11FF11">Don't read too much into it.</font>

05:04.196 --> 05:08.195
<font color="#00FFFF">I ain't going to be his bloody</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">little G, if he walks in with</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">someone else, am I?</font>

<font color="#00FFFF">her. Thank God he didn't, eh?</font>

05:24.196 --> 05:26.195

behaving like a bit of a B.'

05:42.556 --> 05:47.195
<font color="#00FFFF">So, if you put money on what</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">girls will be cracking on in</font>

05:47.196 --> 05:49.195
<font color="#FFFF00">Dani won't. Obviously.</font>

05:49.196 --> 05:51.395
<font color="#11FF11">Georgia might, maybe...</font>

05:51.396 --> 05:55.195

<font color="#00FFFF">I don't think she would.</font>

05:55.196 --> 05:59.035
<font color="#11FF11">I think maybe she won't, my head is</font>
<font color="#11FF11">saying she won't.</font>

05:59.036 --> 06:02.195
<font color="#FFFF00">I don't think she will. </font><font color="#11FF11"> But my heart</font>
<font color="#11FF11">is saying that maybe I hope she is.</font>

06:02.196 --> 06:04.195
<font color="#00FFFF">I was going to say, you want her to,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">don't you?</font>

06:04.196 --> 06:07.195
<font color="#11FF11">You feel like a scumbag. You feel</font>
<font color="#11FF11">like a bit of an arsehole.</font>

06:07.196 --> 06:10.195
<font color="#11FF11">Because if you're here doing what</font>
<font color="#11FF11">you are doing, like, it is almost...</font>

06:10.196 --> 06:12.195
<font color="#FFFF00">It is like you are on a lads'</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">holiday!</font>

06:12.196 --> 06:14.235
<font color="#11FF11">Yeah, and you're doing a few bits</font>
<font color="#11FF11">you shouldn't be doing.</font>

06:14.236 --> 06:18.195
<font color="#00FFFF">I know what you mean.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">Then you go home to your missus</font>
<font color="#11FF11">and bring your new girlfriend.</font>

06:18.196 --> 06:19.196
<font color="#11FF11">Do you know what I mean?</font>

06:19.197 --> 06:23.715
<font color="#11FF11">In that way, I guess, you can't be</font>

<font color="#11FF11">them.</font>

06:23.716 --> 06:27.195
That's what it feels like, but what
it actually is,

06:27.196 --> 06:30.195
you have known the girl for three
weeks. Which is nothing.

06:30.196 --> 06:35.195
You like her. <font color="#FFFF00">You found someone you</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">got a better connection with. </font><font color="#11FF11"> Yeah.</font>

06:52.196 --> 06:55.235
<font color="#00FFFF">Mannerisms are really big thing to</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">me.</font>

06:55.236 --> 06:59.195
<font color="#00FFFF">Like, just someone who is really</font>

<font color="#00FFFF">and everything.</font>

07:02.196 --> 07:04.195
<font color="#FFFF00">What is stopping you from meeting</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">someone?</font>

07:04.196 --> 07:08.395
<font color="#00FFFF">I think, because I have</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">been focusing on my career.</font>

07:08.396 --> 07:12.195
<font color="#00FFFF">I haven't really had time to date.</font>

<font color="#00FFFF">that</font>

07:17.196 --> 07:20.195
<font color="#00FFFF">I would look and think, 'Oh,</font>

07:20.196 --> 07:22.195
<font color="#FFFF00">So, come on, you are a hairdresser.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Yeah.</font>

<font color="#FFFF00">know, flat.</font>

07:32.196 --> 07:35.195
<font color="#FFFF00">No-one likes that flat... </font><font color="#00FFFF"> Need that</font>

12:49.196 --> 12:51.195
<font color="#00FFFF">Bit of spice? </font><font color="#FFFF00"> Yeah.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">It just gave me...</font>

<font color="#00FFFF">Vitamin B12, a bit of folate</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">and all that. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> Gave me a boost.</font>

12:54.196 --> 12:58.195
<font color="#FFFF00">And then I was on top form.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">And now I just feel like today</font>

13:00.196 --> 13:04.195
<font color="#00FFFF">You're a hairdresser, but at the</font>

<font color="#00FFFF">businesswoman, career driven.</font>

13:04.196 --> 13:07.195
<font color="#FFFF00">It's nice to hear that you are</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">shocked with how I am and stuff,</font>

<font color="#FFFF00">don't perceive me as...</font>

13:12.196 --> 13:15.195
<font color="#00FFFF">No, they shouldn't, it's a judgement</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">on them, don't worry.</font>

13:15.196 --> 13:18.195
<font color="#FFFF00">Especially because you are really</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">well educated, you're a doctor.</font>

13:18.196 --> 13:21.195
<font color="#00FFFF">Look, we both look after people.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">You look after their hair.</font>

13:28.196 --> 13:30.195
<font color="#00FFFF">That is actually brilliant.</font>

13:30.196 --> 13:33.195
<font color="#00FFFF">That is brilliant. We need to write</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">that one down.</font>

<font color="#00FFFF">I guess, at the moment, it is with</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Gracie,</font>

13:41.396 --> 13:45.195
<font color="#00FFFF">and that is probably who I want to</font>

<font color="#FFFF00">nice spending time with him today</font>

14:15.196 --> 14:18.195
<font color="#FFFF00">just chatting, getting to know him a</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">bit more.</font>

14:18.196 --> 14:20.195
<font color="#FFFF00">And I could talk to him for hours,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">he's so interesting</font>

14:20.196 --> 14:25.195
<font color="#FFFF00">and there's so much more that you</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">can find out about it.</font>

'So, Grace might be giving Alex a
short back and sides,

14:27.196 --> 14:32.195

Georgia might be giving Josh
a knee in his short and curlies.'

14:39.396 --> 14:43.195

<font color="#11FF11">to her situation.</font>

14:43.196 --> 14:48.195
<font color="#11FF11">I would just chat to her</font>
<font color="#11FF11">on a level where I'd be like,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">imagine yourself in my position,</font>

14:48.196 --> 14:51.715
<font color="#11FF11">and I would say, I would be on her</font>
<font color="#11FF11">side, at the same time.</font>

14:51.716 --> 14:54.195
<font color="#11FF11">You don't want to be with a guy</font>

14:54.196 --> 14:58.195
<font color="#11FF11">There was something missing already,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">you can't be angry,</font>

15:01.196 --> 15:04.195
<font color="#11FF11">Every single second that I am here,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">I just want to enjoy it</font>

15:07.196 --> 15:10.195

<font color="#11FF11">really well,</font>

15:10.196 --> 15:13.195
<font color="#11FF11">and it has been a pleasure getting</font>
<font color="#11FF11">to know him.</font>

<font color="#00FFFF">worth it with Kaz,</font>

15:29.236 --> 15:33.555
<font color="#00FFFF">because I do think there is a</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">long-term thing going on here.</font>

15:33.556 --> 15:38.195
<font color="#00FFFF">Do I think Georgia will be upset and</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">bothered and angry? Absolutely.</font>

<font color="#00FFFF">Do I care? Absolutely.</font>

15:41.036 --> 15:44.235

15:53.876 --> 15:55.195
<font color="#FFFF00">D'you know what I mean?</font>

15:55.196 --> 15:59.196
<font color="#00FFFF">If he liked you, why would he do</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">that? D'you know what I mean?</font>

16:01.196 --> 16:05.235
<font color="#FFFF00">Because I feel like, sometimes, boys</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">can be boys.</font>

16:05.236 --> 16:09.195
<font color="#FFFF00">Maybe it was very similar to what he</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">went through,</font>

16:09.196 --> 16:11.195
<font color="#FFFF00">what I have been through with you,</font>

16:11.196 --> 16:14.195
<font color="#FFFF00">cos when you did come in here, you</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">were completely my type,</font>

16:14.196 --> 16:18.195
<font color="#FFFF00">and I even said to the girls, "oh,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">my God, he's so fit." </font><font color="#00FFFF"> Yeah, thanks.</font>

16:18.196 --> 16:24.555
<font color="#FFFF00">And, yeah, however, because I can't</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">talk to Josh about how I feel,</font>

16:24.556 --> 16:27.195
<font color="#FFFF00">I have to go by the loyalty trait</font>

16:27.196 --> 16:31.195
<font color="#FFFF00">and that is what I carry with me</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">through thick and thin.</font>

16:31.196 --> 16:32.196
<font color="#00FFFF">Here is another question, then.</font>

16:32.197 --> 16:36.195
<font color="#00FFFF">Say, for instance, he did bring</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">another girl back,</font>

16:36.196 --> 16:38.195
<font color="#00FFFF">how would you react to that and what</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">would you do?</font>

16:38.196 --> 16:40.195
<font color="#FFFF00">I really don't know. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> You don't know?</font>

16:40.196 --> 16:44.195
<font color="#FFFF00">One thing I have learnt is that</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">yeah, you can fancy somebody,</font>

16:44.196 --> 16:45.875
<font color="#FFFF00">yeah, you can think they're fit,</font>

16:45.876 --> 16:49.195
<font color="#FFFF00">but there's more depth to a</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">relationship than that,</font>

16:49.196 --> 16:53.195
<font color="#FFFF00">and I'm very lucky because I feel</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">like I have that with Josh</font>

16:53.196 --> 16:56.195
<font color="#FFFF00">and I can see a future with him.</font>

16:56.196 --> 16:58.195
<font color="#00FFFF">Let's go for a hug.</font>

16:58.196 --> 17:01.195
<font color="#00FFFF">I'd say a kiss, but...</font>

17:01.196 --> 17:05.194
<font color="#FFFF00">Jordan still keeps going for me,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">which I think is lovely,</font>

17:05.195 --> 17:07.194
<font color="#FFFF00">and I'm very flattered.</font>

17:07.195 --> 17:12.194
<font color="#FFFF00">Jordan makes my head turn, however</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Josh makes my head spin.</font>

17:12.195 --> 17:14.194
'Megan wants to know if she can
trust Alex

17:14.195 --> 17:18.194
because she is finally ready to
commit to a serious relationship.

17:18.195 --> 17:21.194
One that can last for a couple of
days minimum.'

17:21.195 --> 17:25.194
<font color="#FFFF00">Obviously, I like Alex, and I know</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">you haven't known him a long time,</font>

17:25.195 --> 17:27.194
<font color="#FFFF00">but from what he says to the boys,</font>

17:27.195 --> 17:29.195
<font color="#FFFF00">what do you reckon his intentions</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">are?</font>

17:29.196 --> 17:32.195
<font color="#FFFF00">I do like him but I feel like he is</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">a bit of a lad.</font>

17:32.196 --> 17:35.195
<font color="#00FFFF">Honestly, when you and Deano were</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">chatting over there,</font>

17:35.196 --> 17:39.395
<font color="#00FFFF">he was bothered, because he was</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">thinking, "I do care about her".</font>

17:39.396 --> 17:41.235
<font color="#FFFF00">He has been single for three years,</font>

17:41.236 --> 17:44.395
<font color="#FFFF00">and I feel like if you are 28 and</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">you are looking for a relationship,</font>

17:44.396 --> 17:46.195
<font color="#FFFF00">why have you been single for three</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">years?</font>

17:46.196 --> 17:49.195
<font color="#11FF11">If you are of a certain age and you</font>
<font color="#11FF11">have not been in a relationship</font>

17:49.196 --> 17:53.195
<font color="#11FF11">for a long time, it can sometimes</font>
<font color="#11FF11">mean you just know what you want</font>

17:53.196 --> 17:56.235
<font color="#11FF11">and you are waiting and you're not</font>
<font color="#11FF11">going to settle for anything less.</font>

17:56.236 --> 17:59.195
<font color="#00FFFF">If I was you, I would take the risk,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">because I think he is such a nice</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">guy.</font>

17:59.196 --> 18:02.195
<font color="#11FF11">You can't not trust someone before</font>
<font color="#11FF11">they have broken your trust.</font>

18:02.196 --> 18:06.195
<font color="#11FF11">We all just have to go for it, and</font>
<font color="#11FF11">you do look good together.</font>

18:06.196 --> 18:09.195
<font color="#FFFF00">Say if Wes comes back, and he</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">hasn't cracked on with anyone,</font>

18:09.196 --> 18:12.035
<font color="#FFFF00">and he's like, "I want to see how</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">things go with you",</font>

18:12.036 --> 18:14.195
<font color="#FFFF00">and I went, "Sorry, I like Alex",</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">pick Alex</font>

18:14.196 --> 18:16.195
<font color="#FFFF00">and then Alex fucks me off, I'm in</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">shit creek.</font>

18:16.196 --> 18:20.195
<font color="#11FF11">Everyone gets shat on once in their</font>
<font color="#11FF11">life or more, d'you know what I</font>
<font color="#11FF11">mean?</font>

18:20.196 --> 18:22.195
<font color="#11FF11">It doesn't make you a bad person.</font>

18:22.196 --> 18:26.035
<font color="#11FF11">Megan is a little bit of a shambles,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">I'm not gonna lie.</font>

18:26.036 --> 18:29.195
<font color="#11FF11">We have made up, put the Wes</font>
<font color="#11FF11">situation behind us.</font>

18:29.196 --> 18:36.195
<font color="#11FF11">Wes, I feel, is going to be loyal to</font>
<font color="#11FF11">her and come back in</font>
<font color="#11FF11">and expect the same.</font>

18:36.196 --> 18:39.195
<font color="#11FF11">Karma's a bitch.</font>

18:39.196 --> 18:44.195
<font color="#11FF11">Just go for it. Like, what's the</font>
<font color="#11FF11">worst that can really happen?</font>

18:44.196 --> 18:46.195
<font color="#FFFF00">Exactly.</font>

18:46.196 --> 18:48.195
<font color="#00FFFF">It's not a problem, d'you know what</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">I mean?</font>

18:48.196 --> 18:50.195
<font color="#00FFFF">Nothing is a problem. It's just a</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">situation.</font>

18:50.196 --> 18:53.195
<font color="#FFFF00">The first time that I have fully</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">liked a guy here,</font>

18:53.196 --> 18:56.555
<font color="#FFFF00">Eyal was the looks and sexual</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">attraction,</font>

18:56.556 --> 19:01.195
<font color="#FFFF00">Wes was the sense of humour, and he</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">was good at everything</font>

19:01.196 --> 19:03.715
<font color="#FFFF00">and I grew to fancy him more and</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">more,</font>

19:03.716 --> 19:08.195
<font color="#FFFF00">but Alex walked in and I knew from</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">the first 10 minutes I liked him.</font>

19:08.196 --> 19:10.195
<font color="#FFFF00">It is a bit of vulnerability.</font>

19:10.196 --> 19:14.195
'Alex has built himself up to ask
Grace a very difficult question:

19:14.196 --> 19:16.715
can he get those trendy shapes saved
into the side of his head

19:16.716 --> 19:19.195
like what all the cool kids have
got?'

19:19.196 --> 19:21.195
<font color="#00FFFF">Sorry, I just want to pull you aside</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">because I want to ask you,</font>

19:21.196 --> 19:25.195
<font color="#00FFFF">I don't how you feel, but tonight it</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">might be nice, if you want to,</font>

19:25.196 --> 19:27.195
<font color="#00FFFF">if you want to share a bed with me</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">tonight.</font>

19:27.196 --> 19:29.195
<font color="#FFFF00">Have you spoken to Charlie about it?</font>

19:29.196 --> 19:32.195
<font color="#00FFFF">I'll chat to her afterwards, but it</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">depends how you feel.</font>

19:32.196 --> 19:36.035
<font color="#FFFF00">Yeah, I am happy to, but obviously,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">speak to Charlie first,</font>

19:36.036 --> 19:39.195
<font color="#FFFF00">because I don't want it to be, like,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">awkward or anything.</font>

19:39.196 --> 19:43.195
<font color="#00FFFF">I'm sure it won't be, at the end of</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">the day, we're just sharing a bed,</font>

19:43.196 --> 19:46.195
<font color="#00FFFF">it means we can have a bit more time</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">one-to-one, a bit of pillow talk.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Yeah.</font>

19:46.196 --> 19:47.715
<font color="#00FFFF">I feel like we're getting on really</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">well</font>

19:47.716 --> 19:50.195
<font color="#00FFFF">and it would be nice to spend more</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">time together.</font>

19:50.196 --> 19:51.196
<font color="#FFFF00">Yeah, all right then, yeah.</font>

19:51.197 --> 19:53.195
<font color="#00FFFF">I'll go and speak to Charlie.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Aw, bless you.</font>

19:53.196 --> 19:56.195
<font color="#00FFFF">Gracie seemed very happy, she was a</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">little concerned, I think,</font>

19:56.196 --> 19:58.395
<font color="#00FFFF">about how Charlie might react, and I</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">just said to her,</font>

19:58.396 --> 20:01.555
<font color="#00FFFF">I'll speak to her and leave that</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">with me.</font>

20:01.556 --> 20:04.195
<font color="#00FFFF">Charlie, can I...? </font><font color="#11FF11"> Yeah.</font>

20:04.196 --> 20:06.235
<font color="#00FFFF">I think I've made the right</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">decision.</font>

20:06.236 --> 20:09.195
<font color="#00FFFF">I want to get to know Gracie a bit</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">more,</font>

20:09.196 --> 20:12.195
<font color="#00FFFF">and I feel like, yeah, a bit of</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">pillow talk would be good.</font>

20:12.196 --> 20:16.195
<font color="#00FFFF">I just want to say that, obviously,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">I spent two nights with you</font>

20:16.196 --> 20:18.195
<font color="#00FFFF">and spent a bit of time getting to</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">know you.</font>

20:18.196 --> 20:22.195
<font color="#00FFFF">I just basically think that tonight,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">I just want to spend time with</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Gracie,</font>

20:22.196 --> 20:24.555
<font color="#00FFFF">so I've asked if she wants to share</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">the bed tonight.</font>

20:24.556 --> 20:27.035
<font color="#11FF11">Yeah, that's fine. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> I can get to know</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">her a bit more.</font>

20:27.036 --> 20:29.395
<font color="#00FFFF">When you are one-to-one, you can get</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">to know each other a bit more.</font>

20:29.396 --> 20:31.555
<font color="#11FF11">That's fine. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> I hope you're</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">OK with that.</font>

20:31.556 --> 20:33.395
<font color="#11FF11">I'm really glad you brought</font>
<font color="#11FF11">me up on it,</font>

20:33.396 --> 20:36.195
<font color="#11FF11">honestly, rather than me be like,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">where do you want me to sleep?</font>

20:36.196 --> 20:40.715
<font color="#00FFFF">And it's not like the case that I'm</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">not interested and I don't want to</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">see how things go with you,</font>

20:40.716 --> 20:44.195
<font color="#00FFFF">it's just the fact that I haven't</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">really spent much time with her</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">and it would be nice.</font>

20:44.196 --> 20:47.195
<font color="#00FFFF">You know what I'm like, I'm genuine,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">I'm not trying to get the best</font>

20:47.196 --> 20:49.195
<font color="#00FFFF">of two or anything, it shouldn't</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">be...</font>

20:49.196 --> 20:51.195
<font color="#11FF11">Honestly, you don't have to explain</font>
<font color="#11FF11">yourself.</font>

20:51.196 --> 20:53.395
<font color="#00FFFF">Thank you for being so good. </font><font color="#11FF11"> Oh,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">it's fine.</font>

20:53.396 --> 20:56.395
<font color="#00FFFF">I really wanted to be open and</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">honest through this process</font>

20:56.396 --> 20:58.875
<font color="#00FFFF">and I told Charlie what I am</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">thinking,</font>

20:58.876 --> 21:01.715
<font color="#00FFFF">what I'm feeling at the moment, and</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">she took it quite well, actually.</font>

21:01.716 --> 21:04.195
<font color="#00FFFF">I could see she was a bit</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">disappointed,</font>

21:04.196 --> 21:07.715
<font color="#00FFFF">but at the end of the day, I would</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">like to spend the night with Gracie.</font>

21:07.716 --> 21:09.195
'It's a full moon AGAIN,

21:09.196 --> 21:15.195
and the islanders are getting ready
for bed.'

21:15.196 --> 21:18.195
<font color="#FFFF00">Love you. Love you girls, see yous</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">tomorrow.</font>

21:18.196 --> 21:21.715
<font color="#00FFFF">Do you think Josh has slept in a</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">bed with a girl?</font>

21:21.716 --> 21:25.195
<font color="#11FF11">Yeah. Now I do.</font>

21:25.196 --> 21:29.195
<font color="#00FFFF">I don't think he slept on the</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">fucking sofa.</font>

21:29.196 --> 21:31.196
<font color="#11FF11">Night, babe.</font>

21:52.196 --> 21:55.195
<font color="#FFFF00">Alex said to me, he was like, at</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">the end of the day,</font>

21:55.196 --> 21:57.195
<font color="#FFFF00">I've shared a bed with Charlie</font>

21:57.196 --> 22:00.196
<font color="#FFFF00">and I think he wants to do the same</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">with me now.</font>

22:40.196 --> 22:42.195
Coming up: a text spells trouble.

22:42.196 --> 22:44.715
<font color="#00FFFF">There will be a recoupling</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">in which you must decide...</font>

22:44.716 --> 22:47.195
<font color="#FFFF00">..whether you want to remain coupled</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">up with your partner</font>

22:47.196 --> 22:49.195
<font color="#FFFF00">back in the villa...</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">..or twist and recouple.</font>

22:49.196 --> 22:50.196
<font color="#11FF11">ALL: Oh!</font>

22:50.196 --> 22:51.196
<font color="#FFFF00">Shit.</font>

22:53.196 --> 22:56.195
Here's your chance to get your very
own taste of the Love Island
lifestyle,

22:56.196 --> 22:59.195
with a massive £20,000 in tax-free
cash

22:59.196 --> 23:03.195
and an unforgettable seven-night
luxury holiday in magical Majorca.

23:03.196 --> 23:07.195
Courtesy of Jet2holidays, you and
five mates will stay at the stunning

23:07.196 --> 23:10.195
five-star Zafiro Palmanova Palace,

23:10.196 --> 23:13.715
and you won't even have to touch
that 20 grand prize money,

23:13.716 --> 23:16.195
because breakfast and dinner are
included,

23:16.196 --> 23:20.195
and we are chucking in 500
euros spending money per person.

23:20.196 --> 23:23.195
Actually, I think I'm free that
week.

23:23.196 --> 23:25.196
For your chance to win this
incredible prize:

23:58.196 --> 24:00.195
The islanders have
a sneaky suspicion

24:00.196 --> 24:01.715
Casa Amor is coming to an end.

24:01.716 --> 24:04.875
Is it something in the air?
A feeling in their bones?

24:04.876 --> 24:09.195
Or that fleet of trucks bringing
all the equipment back to the villa?

24:09.196 --> 24:13.195
<font color="#FFFF00">This could actually be our last day.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Stop thinking like that.</font>

24:13.196 --> 24:17.195
<font color="#FFFF00">There are 24 islanders right now.</font>

24:17.196 --> 24:21.195
<font color="#FFFF00">It is a serious health and safety</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">hazard, Kaz.</font>

24:21.196 --> 24:24.195
<font color="#11FF11">This is gonna go off.</font>

24:24.196 --> 24:26.195
Georgia and Dani have had the chance

24:26.196 --> 24:28.195
to reflect on THAT video message.

24:28.196 --> 24:31.195
Put things in perspective and ask,
was it really that bad?

24:31.196 --> 24:32.196
And the answer is...

24:32.197 --> 24:34.195
Abso-bloody-lutely.

24:34.196 --> 24:37.195
<font color="#FFFF00">Imagine if they are in bed</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">with girls right now. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> Yeah.</font>

24:37.196 --> 24:39.235
<font color="#FFFF00">I have no idea what</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">is gonna happen.</font>

24:39.236 --> 24:42.195
<font color="#FFFF00">I don't feel secure at all.</font>

24:42.196 --> 24:44.195
<font color="#00FFFF">I like him, you know. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> I know.</font>

24:44.196 --> 24:46.195
<font color="#FFFF00">Look at us.</font>

24:46.196 --> 24:49.556
<font color="#00FFFF">Absolute melts.</font>

24:53.196 --> 24:57.195
In Casa Amor, Adam is waking up after
another night with Darylle.

24:57.196 --> 24:58.715
Loads in common, those two.

24:58.716 --> 25:01.195
For example, neither of them have
ever said to a tattoo artist,

25:01.196 --> 25:04.716
"Do you think that is not too much?"

25:10.196 --> 25:12.195
<font color="#FFFF00">This is the Do Bits Society,</font>

25:12.196 --> 25:14.555
<font color="#FFFF00">Do Bits Society on tour.</font>

25:14.556 --> 25:17.195
<font color="#FFFF00">Anything to report, Adam?</font>

25:17.196 --> 25:20.195
<font color="#00FFFF">There was a lot of teasing.</font>

25:20.196 --> 25:26.195
<font color="#11FF11">There was no contact?</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">There was no heavy duty contact.</font>

25:26.196 --> 25:29.195
<font color="#11FF11">OK. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> Johnson was left alone.</font>

25:29.196 --> 25:31.195
<font color="#00FFFF">Yeah, my Johnson was left alone.</font>

25:31.196 --> 25:35.195
<font color="#FFFF00">So... did we make a decision</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">on who was in the bed?</font>

25:35.196 --> 25:38.195
<font color="#00FFFF">There's an 89th minute substitution,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">yeah.</font>

25:38.196 --> 25:40.195
<font color="#00FFFF">Gracie was in the bed.</font>

25:40.196 --> 25:41.196
<font color="#00FFFF">Charlie is on the subs bench.</font>

25:41.197 --> 25:43.195
<font color="#00FFFF">We'll see how it goes, really.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">She's a nice girl.</font>

25:43.196 --> 25:46.875
<font color="#00FFFF">I don't know... I don't know if it</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">is a romantic thing at the moment.</font>

25:46.876 --> 25:48.195
<font color="#00FFFF">We will see.</font>

25:48.196 --> 25:51.195
<font color="#00FFFF">I put Charlie in the substitute</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">bed last night, unfortunately,</font>

25:51.196 --> 25:53.195
<font color="#00FFFF">cos I wanted to spend</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">more time with Grace.</font>

25:53.196 --> 25:57.195
<font color="#00FFFF">It was nice to chill with her</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">and we were chatting a bit</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">before we went to sleep.</font>

25:57.196 --> 26:00.395
<font color="#00FFFF">Obviously we didn't do any of the</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">levels, because that is not me.</font>

26:00.396 --> 26:03.195
<font color="#00FFFF">We had a little cuddle</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">and went to sleep.</font>

26:03.196 --> 26:05.875
<font color="#00FFFF">It was nice,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">it felt very comfortable.</font>

26:05.876 --> 26:08.195
Back in the villa, there
is big news on the way.

26:08.196 --> 26:11.195
Not the random thing Georgia is
about to say, the bit after that.

26:11.196 --> 26:13.195
<font color="#FFFF00">I do yoga and stuff.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Yoga is really good.</font>

26:13.196 --> 26:16.195
<font color="#FFFF00">I love it. I feel so good after it.</font>

26:16.196 --> 26:19.195
(PHONE BEEPS) <font color="#11FF11">Got a text!</font>

26:19.196 --> 26:21.196
<font color="#FFFF00">Whoa! What?</font>

26:34.196 --> 26:37.195
<font color="#FFFF00">They would have got the same text.</font>

26:37.196 --> 26:39.195
<font color="#00FFFF">It makes me feel a bit sick to think</font>

26:39.196 --> 26:42.195
<font color="#00FFFF">the boys have obviously</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">got that text in Casa Amor.</font>

26:42.196 --> 26:44.195
<font color="#00FFFF">And I don't know how that will go.</font>

26:44.196 --> 26:48.195
<font color="#FFFF00">I know he definitely fancies someone</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">over there, don't I? </font><font color="#11FF11"> Does he?</font>

26:48.196 --> 26:52.195
<font color="#FFFF00">Yeah, because he went thrusting in</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">the bed when she walked past in a</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">little thong.</font>

26:52.196 --> 26:54.195
<font color="#FFFF00">My head is actually gone.</font>

26:54.196 --> 26:56.716
<font color="#FFFF00">I feel like...</font>

26:59.196 --> 27:02.195
<font color="#FFFF00">..I am completely out of control.</font>

27:02.196 --> 27:05.195
<font color="#FFFF00">I'm getting proper, proper paranoid.</font>

27:05.196 --> 27:08.195
(PHONE BEEPS)

27:08.196 --> 27:09.196
<font color="#11FF11">Got a text!</font>

27:09.197 --> 27:11.196
<font color="#11FF11">Oh, hell.</font>

27:25.196 --> 27:27.195
<font color="#00FFFF">Oh, shit!</font>

27:27.196 --> 27:30.195
<font color="#00FFFF">I think there's gonna be</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">a lot of drama tonight.</font>

27:30.196 --> 27:34.195
<font color="#00FFFF">After a couple of emotional days,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">I don't know if I'm ready for it.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">You know?</font>

27:34.196 --> 27:36.195
<font color="#11FF11">Hell.</font>

27:36.196 --> 27:39.195
<font color="#FFFF00">I am not in the business</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">of breaking hearts.</font>

27:39.196 --> 27:42.195
<font color="#FFFF00">I know Georgia likes</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">me and I did like...</font>

27:42.196 --> 27:43.235
<font color="#FFFF00">I DO like Georgia.</font>

27:43.236 --> 27:46.195
<font color="#FFFF00">But there are levels, I think,</font>

27:46.196 --> 27:48.195
<font color="#FFFF00">and the levels I am feeling</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">at the moment for Kaz</font>

27:48.196 --> 27:53.195
<font color="#FFFF00">outweigh those after even</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">a couple of weeks with Georgia.</font>

27:53.196 --> 27:57.195
<font color="#00FFFF">Does that make you feel better?</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Yeah, a lot. Thank you.</font>

27:57.196 --> 28:01.195
<font color="#11FF11">Josh looks stressed. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> Does he?</font>

28:01.196 --> 28:03.195
<font color="#11FF11">It looks like he is thinking a lot.</font>

28:03.196 --> 28:07.195
<font color="#11FF11">It is gonna be hard for him.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Of course it is.</font>

28:07.196 --> 28:11.195
<font color="#FFFF00">You have had a lovely connection and</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">it would be silly to throw it away.</font>

28:11.196 --> 28:13.195
<font color="#11FF11">That's true.</font>

28:13.196 --> 28:17.195
<font color="#FFFF00">But if he did not pick you,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">that would be the biggest regret.</font>

28:17.196 --> 28:20.195
Alex is deciding which girl
to couple up with.

28:20.196 --> 28:23.195
Charlie can get him laughing,
smiling and feeling happy.

28:23.196 --> 28:25.195
While Grace can get him
a 70% discount

28:25.196 --> 28:27.195
on highlights weekdays before six.

28:27.196 --> 28:29.195
<font color="#FFFF00">I am in a difficult</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">one at the moment,</font>

28:29.196 --> 28:32.195
<font color="#FFFF00">because on one hand I had a</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">connection with one girl,</font>

28:32.196 --> 28:34.395
<font color="#FFFF00">had a laugh and had a lot of fun,</font>

28:34.396 --> 28:37.195
<font color="#FFFF00">but then things weren't going</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">any deeper than that.</font>

28:37.196 --> 28:40.715
<font color="#FFFF00">And unexpectedly someone else</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">has caught my eye,</font>

28:40.716 --> 28:44.395
<font color="#FFFF00">really being...</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Grace is really open and things,</font>

28:44.396 --> 28:48.195
<font color="#FFFF00">she is really good fun,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">really kind and nice as well.</font>

28:48.196 --> 28:50.195
<font color="#FFFF00">Very driven.</font>

28:50.196 --> 28:52.195
<font color="#FFFF00">At the moment I am still trying</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">to work out in my head</font>

28:52.196 --> 28:55.195
<font color="#FFFF00">what I should do and what decision</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I need to make.</font>

28:55.196 --> 28:58.195
<font color="#FFFF00">At the end of the day Charlie</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">doesn't wear a lot of make-up,</font>

28:58.196 --> 29:02.195
<font color="#FFFF00">she has natural hair, she is</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">a very natural-looking girl.</font>

29:02.196 --> 29:03.235
<font color="#FFFF00">That is what I am attracted to.</font>

29:03.236 --> 29:06.195
<font color="#FFFF00">Whereas Grace is absolute...</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">She is incredibly beautiful.</font>

29:06.196 --> 29:10.395
<font color="#FFFF00">She is less obviously my type.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I think that is fair.</font>

29:10.396 --> 29:13.035
<font color="#FFFF00">Just less obviously my type.</font>

29:13.036 --> 29:15.555
<font color="#FFFF00">That is not a judgement on her,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">that is just what it is.</font>

29:15.556 --> 29:18.195
<font color="#FFFF00">People grow on you a lot, don't</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">they?</font>

29:18.196 --> 29:20.195
<font color="#FFFF00">I need... Oh, I don't know.</font>

29:20.196 --> 29:23.195
<font color="#FFFF00">I don't know.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">It is actually very difficult.</font>

29:23.196 --> 29:25.195
<font color="#FFFF00">This is a huge shakeup.</font>

29:25.196 --> 29:29.195
<font color="#FFFF00">This re-coupling is going to be</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">the biggest shakeup in the villa.</font>

29:29.196 --> 29:31.875
<font color="#FFFF00">It is gonna be huge.</font>

29:31.876 --> 29:34.195
The boys can't wait
to get back home,

29:34.196 --> 29:37.395
although they are really going to
miss staring at that orange flamingo.

29:37.396 --> 29:39.195
<font color="#FFFF00">Look, I will be honest.</font>

29:39.196 --> 29:43.195
<font color="#FFFF00">Even though I have got 100% trust</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">in Dani,</font>

29:43.196 --> 29:47.195
<font color="#FFFF00">there was always a small</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">tiny part of you that worries,</font>

29:47.196 --> 29:49.235
<font color="#FFFF00">what the fuck are they doing there?</font>

29:49.236 --> 29:52.555
<font color="#FFFF00">What if some geezer</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">blew her socks off?</font>

29:52.556 --> 29:55.195
<font color="#FFFF00">I fucking highly doubt it,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I don't like to think it,</font>

29:55.196 --> 29:56.196
<font color="#FFFF00">but you never fucking know.</font>

29:56.197 --> 29:59.195
<font color="#FFFF00">That is the main</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">thing about being in here.</font>

29:59.196 --> 30:01.195
<font color="#00FFFF">I don't think Georgia</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">would have done anything.</font>

30:01.196 --> 30:05.195
<font color="#00FFFF">That is what is worrying me, I don't</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">want to be in this situation.</font>

30:05.196 --> 30:08.195
<font color="#00FFFF">Where I come back and I break</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">her little heart.</font>

30:08.196 --> 30:11.195
<font color="#11FF11">You are not pranged</font>
<font color="#11FF11">that Megan might be...</font>

30:11.196 --> 30:16.195
<font color="#FFFF00">I am just fucking trying to</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">get that out of my head.</font>

30:16.196 --> 30:19.035
<font color="#00FFFF">In my opinion, she'll be standing</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">there waiting for you when</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">you get back.</font>

30:19.036 --> 30:20.195
<font color="#00FFFF">Have faith in yourself.</font>

30:20.196 --> 30:23.195
<font color="#00FFFF">Let's fucking know that</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">we're going back to the birds</font>

30:23.196 --> 30:26.035
<font color="#00FFFF">that we fucking really like.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">Yeah, hopefully.</font>

30:26.036 --> 30:27.195
<font color="#00FFFF">Let's know that, yeah.</font>

30:27.196 --> 30:29.195
<font color="#00FFFF">It's a PMA at all times,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">positive mental attitude.</font>

30:29.196 --> 30:32.195
<font color="#00FFFF">I don't want you sitting</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">here moping, mate,</font>

30:32.196 --> 30:33.875
<font color="#00FFFF">cos you fucking done you in here.</font>

30:33.876 --> 30:35.235
<font color="#00FFFF">You said to me,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">"I'm missing Meg, mate."</font>

30:35.236 --> 30:38.195
<font color="#00FFFF">I know she'll be thinking</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">the same thing,</font>

30:38.196 --> 30:40.195
<font color="#00FFFF">standing on her own,</font>

30:40.196 --> 30:42.875
<font color="#00FFFF">and you can continue your journey,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">mate.</font>

30:42.876 --> 30:44.875
<font color="#11FF11">I do miss Meg.</font>

30:44.876 --> 30:47.195
<font color="#11FF11">Obviously I don't know</font>
<font color="#11FF11">what has happened there</font>

30:47.196 --> 30:49.195
<font color="#11FF11">but I have got faith</font>
<font color="#11FF11">that nothing has happened,</font>

30:49.196 --> 30:51.395
<font color="#11FF11">I walk in and she's single, I'm</font>
<font color="#11FF11">single, and then we can crack on.</font>

30:51.396 --> 30:54.195
<font color="#11FF11">But... pfft...</font>

30:54.196 --> 30:57.196
<font color="#11FF11">It is just the whole thing</font>
<font color="#11FF11">stressing me, man.</font>

31:02.196 --> 31:04.195
<font color="#FFFF00">Wes has coupled up with who?</font>

31:04.196 --> 31:06.235
<font color="#00FFFF">Wes is coupled up</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">with Laura at the moment</font>

31:06.236 --> 31:09.195
<font color="#00FFFF">so hopefully he will couple</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">up with another girl.</font>

31:09.196 --> 31:12.195
<font color="#11FF11">I think he's going to bring</font>
<font color="#11FF11">the girl back that was in here.</font>

31:12.196 --> 31:14.195
<font color="#FFFF00">Do you not think Wes</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">is a little bit worried</font>

31:14.196 --> 31:18.195
<font color="#FFFF00">about looking like a bit of a dick</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">if he jumped ship with you</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">and then he is like...</font>

31:18.196 --> 31:22.195
<font color="#FFFF00">Because if he is thinking about you,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">he will be thinking,</font>

31:22.196 --> 31:24.235
<font color="#FFFF00">"Fuck, what if I have</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">just got with Meg</font>

31:24.236 --> 31:26.395
<font color="#FFFF00">and then jumped ship over there?"</font>

31:26.396 --> 31:29.195
<font color="#00FFFF">He took a massive risk</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">ending things with Laura</font>

31:29.196 --> 31:31.195
<font color="#00FFFF">and trying it with me.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">He bombs that straight off.</font>

31:31.196 --> 31:33.875
<font color="#11FF11">Is that what you are saying?</font>
<font color="#11FF11">You are done with Wes?</font>

31:33.876 --> 31:36.195
<font color="#00FFFF">So done with Wes.</font>

31:36.196 --> 31:39.195
<font color="#00FFFF">If Wes brings back a new girl</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">I feel like, good for him.</font>

31:39.196 --> 31:41.195
<font color="#00FFFF">It would do me a favour,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">because I like Alex.</font>

31:41.196 --> 31:44.195
<font color="#00FFFF">I would be like,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">"Oh, OK, I can relax.</font>

31:44.196 --> 31:48.195
<font color="#00FFFF">Wes can crack on with a new girl</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">and I can crack on with Alex."</font>

31:48.196 --> 31:51.195
<font color="#FFFF00">It's shit, babe. Honestly.</font>

31:51.196 --> 31:53.196
<font color="#FFFF00">I feel your fucking pain.</font>

31:56.876 --> 31:59.195
<font color="#FFFF00">It's gonna be fine, I promise.</font>

31:59.196 --> 32:01.195
<font color="#FFFF00">It is.</font>

32:01.196 --> 32:04.195
<font color="#00FFFF">I don't know if he likes me.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Of course he does.</font>

32:04.196 --> 32:07.035
<font color="#FFFF00">Whatever happens, all right,</font>

32:07.036 --> 32:09.195
<font color="#FFFF00">whatever happens,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">you're gonna be fine.</font>

32:09.196 --> 32:10.196
<font color="#FFFF00">Same as me.</font>

32:10.197 --> 32:13.875
<font color="#FFFF00">If it doesn't work out,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">it doesn't work out for a reason.</font>

32:13.876 --> 32:16.195
<font color="#00FFFF">I really feel like</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">these past four days</font>

32:16.196 --> 32:19.195
<font color="#00FFFF">have made me realise how</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">much I actually like the guy.</font>

32:19.196 --> 32:22.195
<font color="#00FFFF">Imagine if I can't even</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">tell him that, Dan.</font>

32:22.196 --> 32:25.195
<font color="#FFFF00">You will. I really think</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">you're gonna be fine.</font>

32:25.196 --> 32:27.555
<font color="#FFFF00">You've got to think the boys</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">that have gone in that villa,</font>

32:27.556 --> 32:30.195
<font color="#FFFF00">the boys that are definitely,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">definitely gonna recouple,</font>

32:30.196 --> 32:33.195
<font color="#FFFF00">cos they weren't happy</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">where they were, they wasn't secure.</font>

32:33.196 --> 32:34.196
<font color="#FFFF00">Josh is secure with you.</font>

32:34.197 --> 32:38.195
<font color="#FFFF00">Why would he want to fuck that off</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">for a girl that he's just met?</font>

32:38.196 --> 32:41.195
<font color="#FFFF00">And if he does do that, then</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">was it really worth it? No.</font>

32:41.196 --> 32:43.555
<font color="#FFFF00">Would it have worked</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">in the real world? No.</font>

32:43.556 --> 32:46.195
<font color="#00FFFF">I really liked him, didn't I?</font>

32:46.196 --> 32:49.195
<font color="#00FFFF">And I think I was</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">in denial for a while.</font>

32:49.196 --> 32:52.195
<font color="#00FFFF">Because I don't like</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">to let my wall down.</font>

32:52.196 --> 32:55.195
<font color="#00FFFF">I think Josh was chipping</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">away at it a bit.</font>

32:55.196 --> 33:00.195
<font color="#00FFFF">I really want to let</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">him know how I feel.</font>

33:00.196 --> 33:03.195
<font color="#FFFF00">If he wants to lose</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">all that, then fine,</font>

33:03.196 --> 33:06.195
<font color="#FFFF00">for a girl that he's just met,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">was it really worth it?</font>

33:06.196 --> 33:08.195
<font color="#FFFF00">No, same as me.</font>

33:08.196 --> 33:11.195
<font color="#00FFFF">You're gonna be fine.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I don't know that.</font>

33:11.196 --> 33:14.195
<font color="#FFFF00">He's been wrapped around</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">his ex for four days.</font>

33:14.196 --> 33:16.195
<font color="#FFFF00">I don't fucking know what she said.</font>

33:16.196 --> 33:19.195
<font color="#00FFFF">If she was everything to him, he</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">wouldn't have come in here, Dan.</font>

33:19.196 --> 33:23.195
<font color="#FFFF00">But he might have thought, "Maybe</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">she is more worth it than Dani."</font>

33:23.196 --> 33:25.195
<font color="#FFFF00">I don't know that, do I?</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I don't know.</font>

33:25.196 --> 33:27.195
<font color="#FFFF00">We both don't know.</font>

33:27.196 --> 33:30.195
<font color="#FFFF00">He would be a stupid idiot</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">to lose a girl like you.</font>

33:30.196 --> 33:33.195
<font color="#FFFF00">I promise you, we have</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">got each other, we have.</font>

33:33.196 --> 33:35.196
<font color="#FFFF00">I love you.</font>

33:39.196 --> 33:41.196
<font color="#00FFFF">God, I like him.</font>

33:44.036 --> 33:47.196
<font color="#00FFFF">I just want to know</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">what he's thinking.</font>

33:55.556 --> 33:57.716
<font color="#00FFFF">Do I think I love Josh?</font>

34:00.196 --> 34:02.196
<font color="#00FFFF">I'll know after tonight.</font>

34:04.196 --> 34:06.195
Coming up...

34:06.196 --> 34:07.196
<font color="#FFFF00">No!</font>

34:07.197 --> 34:09.195
Caroline Flack is very much back.

34:09.196 --> 34:10.196
<font color="#FFFF00">Hello, everyone!</font>

34:20.196 --> 34:23.195
The islanders have gathered for the
re-coupling.

34:23.196 --> 34:25.235
Only the newbies face being dumped
if they are not in a couple.

34:25.235 --> 34:29.195
So it's about to get very crowded in
there and extremely awkward.

34:29.196 --> 34:31.715
Caroline, the stage is yours.

34:31.716 --> 34:34.195
Get in there and Flack them up!

34:34.196 --> 34:38.396
<font color="#FFFF00">(MUSIC)</font>

34:58.556 --> 35:00.196
<font color="#11FF11">(GASPS) </font><font color="#00FFFF"> No!</font>

35:03.196 --> 35:05.195
<font color="#FFFF00">Hi, everyone!</font>

35:05.196 --> 35:07.235
(COMMOTION)

35:07.236 --> 35:09.395
<font color="#00FFFF">She is so fit.</font>

35:09.396 --> 35:10.555
<font color="#FFFF00">How are you?</font>

35:10.556 --> 35:11.875
<font color="#00FFFF">ALL: Fine.</font>

35:11.876 --> 35:14.195
<font color="#FFFF00">I think we need a chat.</font>

35:14.196 --> 35:19.036
<font color="#FFFF00">Girls, stay where you are. Boys,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">come and stand with me.</font>

35:38.196 --> 35:40.395
<font color="#FFFF00">Girls, how are you feeling?</font>

35:40.396 --> 35:44.195
<font color="#00FFFF">Really nervous. This is the most</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">nervous I have felt.</font>

35:44.196 --> 35:49.195
<font color="#FFFF00">As you know, tonight there will be</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">a re-coupling.</font>

35:49.196 --> 35:54.235
<font color="#FFFF00">Girls, you each have a big decision</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">to make.</font>

35:54.236 --> 35:59.195
<font color="#FFFF00">I will now ask you one by one if you</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">want</font>

35:59.196 --> 36:01.195
<font color="#FFFF00">to stick with your current partner</font>

36:01.196 --> 36:05.195
<font color="#FFFF00">who has been living in Casa Amor for</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">the past few days or if you want to</font>

36:05.196 --> 36:09.196
<font color="#FFFF00">re-couple with one of these handsome</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">boys.</font>

36:12.196 --> 36:16.195
<font color="#FFFF00">The boys in Casa Amor have also been</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">given the choice of whether they</font>

36:16.196 --> 36:21.195
<font color="#FFFF00">want to stick with you or re-couple</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">with one of the new girls.</font>

36:21.196 --> 36:26.195
<font color="#FFFF00">Megan, I will start with you. Please</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">stand up.</font>

36:26.196 --> 36:29.395
<font color="#FFFF00">As your partner Eyal was dumped from</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">the island,</font>

36:29.396 --> 36:32.195
<font color="#FFFF00">you are officially single.</font>

36:32.196 --> 36:34.715
<font color="#FFFF00">But before the boys left for Casa</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Amor,</font>

36:34.716 --> 36:39.195
<font color="#FFFF00">you were romantically involved with</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Wes. You have the choice.</font>

36:39.196 --> 36:44.195
<font color="#FFFF00">You can stay single and if Wes has</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">stayed single too,</font>

36:44.196 --> 36:47.195
<font color="#FFFF00">you two can pick</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">up where you left off.</font>

36:47.196 --> 36:51.196
<font color="#FFFF00">Or has one of the new boys caught</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">your eye?</font>

36:53.716 --> 36:55.195
<font color="#00FFFF">Although I was getting to know Wes,</font>

36:55.196 --> 37:00.195
<font color="#00FFFF">I feel like I have had a really good</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">connection with one of the new boys.</font>

37:00.196 --> 37:04.195
<font color="#00FFFF">He is genuine, he is fun and I</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">really fancy him.</font>

37:04.196 --> 37:08.555
<font color="#00FFFF">I have decided to couple up with one</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">of the new boys.</font>

37:08.556 --> 37:12.196
<font color="#FFFF00">Who would you like to couple up</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">with?</font>

37:14.556 --> 37:18.195
<font color="#00FFFF">Alex. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> Congratulations, guys.</font>

37:18.196 --> 37:19.196
<font color="#FFFF00">You are our first couple.</font>

37:19.197 --> 37:22.196
<font color="#FFFF00">Alex, you can go and join Megan.</font>

37:35.036 --> 37:37.195
<font color="#FFFF00">We also had a single boy at Casa</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Amor.</font>

37:37.196 --> 37:41.195
<font color="#FFFF00">Adam, who has been single since Zara</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">was dumped from the island.</font>

37:41.196 --> 37:43.195
<font color="#FFFF00">It is now time to find out if Adam</font>

37:43.196 --> 37:49.196
<font color="#FFFF00">has stayed single or coupled up with</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">one of the new girls.</font>

37:56.236 --> 37:58.196
<font color="#11FF11">Oh, my God...</font>

38:01.196 --> 38:02.196
<font color="#00FFFF">Hi. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> Hi, welcome back, Adam.</font>

38:02.197 --> 38:04.195
<font color="#FFFF00">Welcome to the villa, Darylle.</font>

38:04.196 --> 38:05.196
<font color="#11FF11">Hi!</font>

38:07.556 --> 38:10.395
<font color="#FFFF00">Adam, why did you decide</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">to couple up with Darylle?</font>

38:10.396 --> 38:14.195
<font color="#00FFFF">I was in an awkward situation,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">after Zara leaving the other night.</font>

38:14.196 --> 38:17.235
<font color="#00FFFF">We have got on from the off and I do</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">find her really attractive.</font>

38:17.236 --> 38:21.195
<font color="#FFFF00">If Zara was still here, do you think</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">you would have coupled up with</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Darylle?</font>

38:21.196 --> 38:23.396
<font color="#00FFFF">Yes, I do.</font>

38:30.036 --> 38:33.036
<font color="#FFFF00">Go and take a seat.</font>

38:47.876 --> 38:50.195
<font color="#FFFF00">Ellie, please stand up.</font>

38:50.196 --> 38:54.195
<font color="#FFFF00">You were coupled with Alex before</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">the boys left the villa.</font>

38:54.196 --> 38:56.195
<font color="#FFFF00">You must now decide whether you want</font>

38:56.196 --> 39:00.195
<font color="#FFFF00">to stay coupled up with Alex or</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">re-couple with one of the new boys.</font>

39:00.196 --> 39:05.195
<font color="#11FF11">In my couple, there wasn't a</font>
<font color="#11FF11">romantic connection and I feel there</font>

39:05.196 --> 39:10.196
<font color="#11FF11">has been a boy who has come in here</font>
<font color="#11FF11">putting 100% effort into me.</font>

39:13.196 --> 39:18.195
<font color="#11FF11">I love waking up every morning to</font>
<font color="#11FF11">his big blue eyes.</font>

39:18.196 --> 39:23.876
<font color="#11FF11">So I would like to re-couple. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> Who</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">would you like to re-couple with?</font>

39:25.196 --> 39:30.396
<font color="#11FF11">Charlie. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> Congratulations, Charlie.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Well done, guys.</font>

39:39.196 --> 39:41.195
<font color="#FFFF00">Let's see whether Alex decided to</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">stick</font>

39:41.196 --> 39:44.195
<font color="#FFFF00">with Ellie or re-couple with one of</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">the new girls.</font>

39:44.196 --> 39:47.555
<font color="#FFFF00">Ellie, as you have decided to</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">re-couple, if Alex walks in alone,</font>

39:47.556 --> 39:51.556
<font color="#FFFF00">he will remain in the villa but he</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">will be single.</font>

40:03.196 --> 40:06.875
<font color="#FFFF00">Welcome back, Alex. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> Hello, everyone.</font>

40:06.876 --> 40:09.876
<font color="#FFFF00">Hello, Grace. Welcome to the villa.</font>

40:12.196 --> 40:16.195
<font color="#FFFF00">Hi, guys. Nice to see you looking so</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">happy. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> I am very happy.</font>

40:16.196 --> 40:18.195
<font color="#00FFFF">I am chuffed.</font>

40:18.196 --> 40:21.195
<font color="#00FFFF">She is a great girl, she is</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">beautiful, really driven, good fun.</font>

40:21.196 --> 40:26.195
<font color="#00FFFF">We have had a good laugh the last</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">few days.</font>

40:26.196 --> 40:29.196
<font color="#FFFF00">Congratulations. Go and sit down.</font>

40:42.196 --> 40:44.195
<font color="#FFFF00">Laura, please stand up.</font>

40:44.196 --> 40:48.195
<font color="#FFFF00">You were coupled up with Wes before</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">the boys left for Casa Amor.</font>

40:48.196 --> 40:51.195
<font color="#FFFF00">But as we know, you guys had broke</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">up</font>

40:51.196 --> 40:56.195
<font color="#FFFF00">and Wes had been getting closer</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">to Megan. The choice is still yours.</font>

40:56.196 --> 41:02.195
<font color="#FFFF00">Would you like to stick with Wes or</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">would you like to re-couple?</font>

41:02.196 --> 41:09.195
<font color="#11FF11">I think because Wes and I were no</font>
<font color="#11FF11">longer in a romantic couple, it was</font>

41:09.196 --> 41:13.035
<font color="#11FF11">the perfect timing for someone new</font>
<font color="#11FF11">to walk in.</font>

41:13.036 --> 41:17.715
<font color="#11FF11">I have definitely enjoyed my last</font>
<font color="#11FF11">few days getting to know this boy.</font>

41:17.716 --> 41:23.195
<font color="#11FF11">His competitive, energetic nature is</font>
<font color="#11FF11">really infectious.</font>

41:23.196 --> 41:28.195
<font color="#11FF11">For that reason, I</font>
<font color="#11FF11">would like to re-couple.</font>

41:28.196 --> 41:31.716
<font color="#FFFF00">Who would</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">you like to re-couple with?</font>

41:35.716 --> 41:38.196
<font color="#11FF11">Jack.</font>

41:39.196 --> 41:42.236
<font color="#FFFF00">Congratulations, guys. Well done,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Jack.</font>

41:51.196 --> 41:58.196
<font color="#FFFF00">Now, let's see if Wes has decided to</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">re-couple with a new girl or not.</font>

42:20.556 --> 42:22.235
<font color="#FFFF00">Wes, welcome back to the villa.</font>

42:22.236 --> 42:24.196
<font color="#00FFFF">Hello.</font>

42:31.876 --> 42:34.195
<font color="#FFFF00">How are you? </font><font color="#00FFFF"> Not bad, not bad.</font>

42:34.196 --> 42:38.195
<font color="#FFFF00">As you can see, Laura has decided to</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">re-couple which means you are now</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">single.</font>

42:38.196 --> 42:42.236
<font color="#FFFF00">Megan has also re-coupled.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">How are you feeling?</font>

42:45.196 --> 42:50.715
<font color="#00FFFF">We had the opportunity to start</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">something new but it is what it is.</font>

42:50.716 --> 42:53.195
<font color="#FFFF00">Do you still feel like you made the</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">right decision?</font>

42:53.196 --> 42:56.236
<font color="#00FFFF">Yes, because I felt what I felt.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Go and sit down.</font>

43:41.196 --> 43:43.196
<font color="#FFFF00">Dani, please stand up.</font>

43:46.196 --> 43:50.195
<font color="#FFFF00">What did you think when you saw</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">the villa story come over from Casa</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Amor?</font>

43:50.196 --> 43:52.195
<font color="#11FF11">The fact there was an ex-girlfriend</font>

43:52.196 --> 43:54.235
<font color="#11FF11">in a villa with Jack, initially</font>
<font color="#11FF11">broke my heart.</font>

43:54.236 --> 43:57.395
<font color="#11FF11">They might have had something that</font>
<font color="#11FF11">me and Jack might not have had.</font>

43:57.396 --> 43:59.396
<font color="#11FF11">So... Yeah.</font>

44:02.196 --> 44:09.195
<font color="#FFFF00">Dani, Jack left the villa not only</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">coupled up with you but also</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">as your boyfriend.</font>

44:09.196 --> 44:12.195
<font color="#FFFF00">He has spent the last</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">three days living with his ex.</font>

44:12.196 --> 44:14.195
<font color="#FFFF00">Do you think he would stay loyal or</font>

44:14.196 --> 44:17.195
<font color="#FFFF00">do you think he could be tempted to</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">stray at Casa Amor?</font>

44:17.196 --> 44:18.396
<font color="#11FF11">He better not have.</font>

44:20.236 --> 44:24.196
<font color="#FFFF00">You now have a very important</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">decision to make.</font>

44:25.396 --> 44:29.196
<font color="#FFFF00">Do you stick with Jack or re-couple?</font>

44:30.236 --> 44:34.195
<font color="#11FF11">I stick with Jack.</font>

44:34.196 --> 44:37.195
<font color="#FFFF00">OK, you have decided to stay loyal</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">to Jack.</font>

44:37.196 --> 44:39.195
<font color="#FFFF00">If Jack walks in with one of the</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">girls</font>

44:39.196 --> 44:42.195
<font color="#FFFF00">from Casa Amor, you will be single.</font>

44:42.196 --> 44:47.875
<font color="#FFFF00">If he walks in alone, he is all</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">yours. Are you ready to find out?</font>

44:47.876 --> 44:50.196
<font color="#11FF11">Yes. I am.</font>

44:55.196 --> 44:57.196
<font color="#11FF11">I can't even look.</font>

45:03.196 --> 45:06.196
(CHEERING)

45:08.196 --> 45:10.196
<font color="#00FFFF">What's up, everyone?</font>

45:12.196 --> 45:15.036
<font color="#FFFF00">Hello. You can</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">go and give her a hug. Go on.</font>

45:17.196 --> 45:19.556
<font color="#00FFFF">I have missed you.</font>

45:25.196 --> 45:27.196
<font color="#00FFFF">What's happening?</font>

45:29.196 --> 45:33.195
<font color="#FFFF00">I guess you are still boyfriend and</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">girlfriend? </font><font color="#00FFFF"> Definitely.</font>

45:33.196 --> 45:38.195
<font color="#FFFF00">How are you both feeling? </font><font color="#11FF11"> I was</font>
<font color="#11FF11">expecting the worst. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> So was I.</font>

45:38.196 --> 45:40.195
<font color="#00FFFF">I was panicking.</font>

45:40.196 --> 45:45.196
<font color="#11FF11">He had nothing to panic</font>
<font color="#11FF11">about. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> I am happy. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> Good.</font>

45:50.196 --> 45:53.196
<font color="#11FF11">Are you happy now? </font><font color="#00FFFF"> Yes.</font>

45:57.236 --> 46:00.195
<font color="#FFFF00">Samira, please stand up.</font>

46:00.196 --> 46:06.195
<font color="#FFFF00">How are you feeling? </font><font color="#00FFFF"> Fine. Nervous.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Just a little bit? </font><font color="#00FFFF"> Yes.</font>

46:06.196 --> 46:09.195
<font color="#FFFF00">You were coupled up with Sam before</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">he left the villa.</font>

46:09.196 --> 46:16.195
<font color="#FFFF00">Would you like to stick with Sam or</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">re-couple with one of the new boys?</font>

46:16.196 --> 46:18.195
<font color="#00FFFF">Obviously I was coupled up with Sam</font>

46:18.196 --> 46:23.195
<font color="#00FFFF">and we had a lot of fun and he was</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">such a laugh.</font>

46:23.196 --> 46:27.195
<font color="#00FFFF">But I didn't see anything</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">romantically happening with him.</font>

46:27.196 --> 46:32.875
<font color="#00FFFF">When one of the new boys walked in,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">I instantly knew</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">there was a connection there.</font>

46:32.876 --> 46:38.195
<font color="#00FFFF">I am lucky to have finally found</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">what I have been looking for.</font>

46:38.196 --> 46:40.556
<font color="#00FFFF">I have decided to re-couple.</font>

46:43.196 --> 46:46.196
<font color="#FFFF00">Who would you like to re-couple</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">with?</font>

46:49.556 --> 46:52.195
<font color="#00FFFF">Frankie.</font>

46:52.196 --> 46:59.196
<font color="#FFFF00">Congratulations, Frankie. Go and</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">join Samira.</font>

47:04.196 --> 47:08.196
<font color="#FFFF00">Let's find out if Sam has also</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">re-coupled.</font>

47:19.716 --> 47:24.396
<font color="#FFFF00">Welcome back, Sam. Welcome to the</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">villa, Ellie. </font><font color="#11FF11"> Hello.</font>

47:31.196 --> 47:34.196
<font color="#FFFF00">Hi, guys. How are you feeling?</font>

47:46.196 --> 47:49.195
<font color="#FFFF00">Why did you decide to re-couple with</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Ellie?</font>

47:49.196 --> 47:55.195
<font color="#00FFFF">We have got on really well over the</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">last few days and I see something</font>

47:55.196 --> 47:59.195
<font color="#00FFFF">more romantic with her than the</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">couple I am already in.</font>

47:59.196 --> 48:04.196
<font color="#FFFF00">Ellie, what made you most nervous</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">about coming here? </font><font color="#11FF11"> Meeting everyone.</font>

48:13.196 --> 48:16.196
<font color="#FFFF00">Congratulations. Go and take a seat.</font>

48:43.196 --> 48:46.196
<font color="#FFFF00">Finally, Georgia, please stand up.</font>

48:51.196 --> 48:54.195
<font color="#FFFF00">Georgia, what is going through your</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">head? </font><font color="#00FFFF"> A lot.</font>

48:54.196 --> 48:57.195
<font color="#00FFFF">A lot of stuff is going through my</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">head. My head is spinning.</font>

48:57.196 --> 49:01.195
<font color="#FFFF00">What has it been like here without</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Josh? </font><font color="#00FFFF"> Very different.</font>

49:01.196 --> 49:06.195
<font color="#00FFFF">Very different. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> Have you missed him?</font>

49:06.196 --> 49:12.556
<font color="#00FFFF">I have. A lot. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> The choice is yours.</font>

49:15.876 --> 49:19.195
<font color="#FFFF00">You have to decide whether you trust</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Josh,</font>

49:19.196 --> 49:21.195
<font color="#FFFF00">whether you think he has been loyal</font>

49:21.196 --> 49:27.236
<font color="#FFFF00">to you in Casa Amor and do you want</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">to stick with Josh or re-couple?</font>

49:35.196 --> 49:39.195
<font color="#00FFFF">One thing with me and Josh, I</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">started my relationship very loyal.</font>

49:39.196 --> 49:42.195
<font color="#00FFFF">I think that is a trait I carry</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">which</font>

49:42.196 --> 49:48.196
<font color="#00FFFF">he really likes and appreciates. He</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">is someone I do see a future with.</font>

49:52.196 --> 49:54.396
<font color="#00FFFF">I want to stick with my Josh.</font>

50:00.196 --> 50:04.395
<font color="#FFFF00">Georgia, you have decided to stay</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">coupled up with Josh.</font>

50:04.396 --> 50:09.035
<font color="#FFFF00">If Josh walks in with a new girl,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">you are single.</font>

50:09.036 --> 50:14.195
<font color="#FFFF00">If he walks in</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">alone, he is all yours.</font>

50:14.196 --> 50:17.195
<font color="#FFFF00">Let's find out.</font>

50:17.196 --> 50:21.196
<font color="#00FFFF">I don't even want to look. I don't</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">want to look. I don't.</font>

50:26.196 --> 50:28.196
<font color="#00FFFF">Come on, Josh.</font>

50:30.196 --> 50:33.196
<font color="#00FFFF">Flippin' heck.</font>

50:42.196 --> 50:46.195
<font color="#FFFF00">Georgia, you have decided to stay</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">coupled up with Josh.</font>

50:46.196 --> 50:49.715
<font color="#FFFF00">If Josh walks in with a new girl,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">you are single.</font>

50:49.716 --> 50:52.876
<font color="#FFFF00">If he walks in</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">alone, he is all yours.</font>

50:56.196 --> 50:58.195
<font color="#FFFF00">Let's find out.</font>

50:58.196 --> 51:00.196
<font color="#00FFFF">Come on, Josh.</font>

51:29.196 --> 51:31.196
<font color="#11FF11">Oh, my God.</font>

51:32.196 --> 51:34.196
(MUSIC)

52:17.196 --> 52:21.195
<font color="#FFFF00">Josh, as you can see, Georgia wanted</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">to stay coupled up with you.</font>

52:21.196 --> 52:24.195
<font color="#FFFF00">How do you feel? Do you think you</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">made the right decision?</font>

52:24.196 --> 52:28.195
<font color="#11FF11">I went with my gut and I feel like I</font>
<font color="#11FF11">made the right decision.</font>

52:28.196 --> 52:30.195
<font color="#FFFF00">Why did you want to couple up with</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Kaz?</font>

52:30.196 --> 52:34.195
<font color="#11FF11">I went into Casa Amor thinking I</font>
<font color="#11FF11">wasn't going to get my head turned.</font>

52:34.196 --> 52:35.875
<font color="#11FF11">I thought if I did go in, it would</font>
<font color="#11FF11">have to be</font>

52:35.876 --> 52:38.195
<font color="#11FF11">someone sensational,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">someone who blew me away.</font>

52:38.196 --> 52:40.875
<font color="#11FF11">And Kaz did that.</font>

52:40.876 --> 52:42.196
<font color="#FFFF00">OK...</font>

52:43.196 --> 52:46.195
<font color="#FFFF00">Georgia, how are you feeling?</font>

52:46.196 --> 52:48.196
<font color="#00FFFF">I was loyal to you. My God.</font>

52:56.036 --> 52:58.195
<font color="#00FFFF">I stuck by you, Josh.</font>

52:58.196 --> 53:01.555
<font color="#11FF11">In the situation where we said we</font>
<font color="#11FF11">would be open</font>

53:01.556 --> 53:04.195
<font color="#11FF11">and honest with each other, I didn't</font>
<font color="#11FF11">have the chance.</font>

53:04.196 --> 53:07.195
<font color="#11FF11">I wasn't able to</font>
<font color="#11FF11">speak to you. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> It's fine. </font><font color="#11FF11"> I am sorry.</font>

53:07.196 --> 53:10.196
<font color="#11FF11">I went with my gut.</font>

53:15.396 --> 53:18.195
<font color="#FFFF00">Kaz, how are you feeling?</font>

53:18.196 --> 53:20.195
<font color="#00FFFF">Obviously it is a hard situation for</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">me.</font>

53:20.196 --> 53:23.195
<font color="#00FFFF">I don't want to tread on anyone's</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">toes.</font>

53:23.196 --> 53:27.195
<font color="#00FFFF">But if anyone was in this situation,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">they would probably do the same</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">thing.</font>

53:27.196 --> 53:29.195
<font color="#00FFFF">I felt like I had a strong</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">connection with Josh.</font>

53:29.196 --> 53:31.196
<font color="#FFFF00">OK.</font>

53:38.036 --> 53:41.196
<font color="#FFFF00">Guys, congratulations. Take a seat.</font>

53:48.556 --> 53:51.875
<font color="#00FFFF">I had something right in front of</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">me.</font>

53:51.876 --> 53:54.195
<font color="#11FF11">You stuck with your gut.</font>

53:54.196 --> 53:57.196
<font color="#00FFFF">I could have gone with my head but I</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">went with my heart.</font>

54:08.196 --> 54:10.196
<font color="#00FFFF">(SIGHS)</font>

54:11.196 --> 54:13.395
<font color="#FFFF00">That is the re-coupling complete.</font>

54:13.396 --> 54:16.235
<font color="#FFFF00">Jordan and Dean, I am afraid you</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">weren't picked by any of the girls</font>

54:16.236 --> 54:20.195
<font color="#FFFF00">and we also have two girls from Casa</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Amor who were not picked.</font>

54:20.196 --> 54:22.195
<font color="#FFFF00">Savannah and Charlie.</font>

54:22.196 --> 54:25.196
<font color="#FFFF00">Welcome to the villa. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> Thank you.</font>

54:29.196 --> 54:32.195
<font color="#FFFF00">Hi, guys. Unfortunately, you four</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">were not picked in the re-coupling</font>

54:32.196 --> 54:35.715
<font color="#FFFF00">which means your time</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">on Love Island is now up.</font>

54:35.716 --> 54:38.196
<font color="#FFFF00">You have time to say your</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">goodbyes.</font>

54:39.196 --> 54:42.196
<font color="#FFFF00">The rest of you,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I will see you very soon.</font>

54:45.196 --> 54:48.196
<font color="#00FFFF">Good luck.</font>

54:53.876 --> 54:56.196
<font color="#11FF11">Bye, guys.</font>

55:04.196 --> 55:06.196
<font color="#00FFFF">Are you all right?</font>

55:17.196 --> 55:20.195
<font color="#11FF11">I get that you have done what you</font>
<font color="#11FF11">have done.</font>

55:20.196 --> 55:22.876
<font color="#11FF11">If you feel a certain</font>
<font color="#11FF11">way, you can't hide it.</font>

55:26.196 --> 55:28.195
<font color="#11FF11">She seems like the female</font>
<font color="#11FF11">equivalent of you.</font>

55:28.196 --> 55:31.196
<font color="#11FF11">You have walked</font>
<font color="#11FF11">in and I can just tell.</font>
