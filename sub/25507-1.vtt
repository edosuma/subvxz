01:00.458 --> 01:01.667
I don't know if I can do this.

01:01.709 --> 01:03.458
Chin up, girl.

01:03.500 --> 01:04.458
Remember,

01:04.500 --> 01:07.417
it's all about attitude.

I'm assuming you ladies

02:04.083 --> 02:05.166
found everything you were looking for?

02:07.000 --> 02:08.375
Not everything.

02:08.417 --> 02:09.875
Probably have to hit Armani after lunch.

02:09.917 --> 02:10.917
Oh, right.

02:10.959 --> 02:12.500
What do you say, Ri, Spago,

02:12.542 --> 02:13.625
or sushi?

02:13.667 --> 02:14.959
I'm kind of sick of fish.

02:15.000 --> 02:16.542
Me too.

02:16.583 --> 02:17.750
Spago it is.

02:19.542 --> 02:21.041
Did I say something funny?

02:21.083 --> 02:23.083
No, ma'am.

02:23.125 --> 02:24.875
I get it.

02:24.917 --> 02:26.834
You think we can't afford these clothes.

02:26.875 --> 02:28.125
Not at all.

02:28.166 --> 02:29.208
I'm sure your mother's credit card

02:29.250 --> 02:31.375
has plenty of overdraft protection.

02:33.000 --> 02:34.875
Actually, we'll be paying with cash today.

02:36.166 --> 02:37.208
I see.

02:37.250 --> 02:38.375
So, all one bill, then?

02:38.417 --> 02:39.875
Yup.

02:41.000 --> 02:44.417
That'll be $1,915.38.

02:45.417 --> 02:46.667
Okay...

02:52.917 --> 02:54.166
And there you go.

02:57.125 --> 02:58.291
Keep the change.

02:58.333 --> 02:59.750
Great.

02:59.792 --> 03:00.792
Thank you, ladies.

03:00.834 --> 03:02.291
Do you need any help with your bags?

Where do you want to try next?

03:35.291 --> 03:37.083
I could use a new car.

03:37.125 --> 03:38.709
Maybe an Audi.

03:38.750 --> 03:40.625
That new cabriolet is hot.

03:40.667 --> 03:41.709
Okay, are you nuts?

03:41.750 --> 03:42.667
What?

03:42.709 --> 03:44.250
We are not doing that again.

03:45.291 --> 03:46.417
Whoa! Hang on--

03:47.542 --> 03:48.792
It's worthless paper, Erica.

03:48.834 --> 03:51.625
Are you having a senior's moment?

03:51.667 --> 03:52.709
That "worthless paper"

03:52.750 --> 03:54.875
just bought you a whole new wardrobe.

03:54.917 --> 03:57.458
Okay, we were this close to getting caught.

03:57.500 --> 03:58.625
Do you know

03:58.667 --> 03:59.834
what the penalty is for counterfeiting?

03:59.875 --> 04:01.166
Do you?

04:02.291 --> 04:03.500
No, but that's not the point.

04:03.542 --> 04:05.667
That's exactly the point.

04:05.709 --> 04:07.166
Did you see the look on Morticia's face

04:07.208 --> 04:09.458
when you slapped those Benjamins down?

04:09.500 --> 04:10.792
She didn't have a clue.

04:10.834 --> 04:13.834
She was a clerk at a clothing store, Erica.

04:13.875 --> 04:15.041
Of course, she didn't have a clue.

04:17.583 --> 04:18.791
What are you doing?

04:22.041 --> 04:23.500
Printing some more of these babies.

04:23.542 --> 04:25.417
God, it even feels like money--

04:25.458 --> 04:26.500
Yeah,

04:26.542 --> 04:28.709
because it's 75% cotton,

04:28.750 --> 04:30.792
25% linen...

04:30.834 --> 04:31.959
just like the real thing.

04:32.041 --> 04:35.000
See, this is why we're going to be rich,

04:35.041 --> 04:37.291
attention to detail.

04:37.333 --> 04:38.959
You don't get it.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.875
Look, the newer bills have security features

04:40.917 --> 04:43.667
like microprinting and holographic ribbons,

04:43.709 --> 04:46.208
things I couldn't duplicate even if I wanted to...

04:46.250 --> 04:47.709
which is sort of the point.

04:47.750 --> 04:49.959
Where there's a will, there's a way.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.792
Not this way.

04:51.834 --> 04:53.667
What's wrong with you?

04:53.709 --> 04:54.875
This was your idea.

04:54.917 --> 04:56.375
I thought you wanted to have some fun

04:56.417 --> 04:57.500
while paying off some bills.

04:57.542 --> 04:58.667
I do,

04:58.709 --> 05:01.417
but I don't want to go to jail.

05:04.250 --> 05:05.500
Well, news flash,

05:05.542 --> 05:07.500
your aunt isn't exactly bringing home the bacon

05:07.542 --> 05:09.041
these days.

05:09.083 --> 05:10.583
I can't tell you anything.

05:15.583 --> 05:16.458
She's here.

05:18.500 --> 05:20.125
Promise me

05:20.166 --> 05:21.208
you'll print more.

05:21.250 --> 05:22.667
Forget it, Erica. Come on.

05:24.875 --> 05:26.917
Come on, Ri, you're killing me here...

05:30.583 --> 05:32.917
I'm not going to let you do this.

05:32.959 --> 05:34.458
-Do what? -Aunt Karen...

05:35.417 --> 05:37.542
Hi, um...

05:37.583 --> 05:38.542
Riley's got math homework,

05:38.583 --> 05:39.917
and she was going to blow it off

05:39.959 --> 05:41.083
to go see Oliver.

05:41.125 --> 05:42.333
Wow, narc much?

05:42.375 --> 05:43.417
Riley...

05:43.458 --> 05:45.500
we talked about this.

05:45.542 --> 05:46.750
I like Oliver, I do. He's very polite.

05:48.041 --> 05:49.291
But you've got six months left of school,

05:49.333 --> 05:50.542
you've got to buckle down.

05:50.583 --> 05:52.250
I wish we lived in a world where "A"s in art

05:52.291 --> 05:53.917
could translate into a viable career,

05:53.959 --> 05:55.291
but we don't.

05:55.333 --> 05:56.667
And you can't get into a good college

05:56.709 --> 05:57.917
with a "C" average.

05:57.959 --> 05:59.875
I don't even want to go to college.

05:59.917 --> 06:01.166
At least, not yet.

06:01.208 --> 06:03.000
Anyways, we can't even afford it.

06:03.041 --> 06:04.125
Scholarship money.

06:04.166 --> 06:05.375
There's plenty of it out there,

06:05.417 --> 06:06.792
but you have to earn it.

06:06.834 --> 06:08.542
That means good grades.

06:08.583 --> 06:10.333
And I hate to sound like a broken record,

06:10.375 --> 06:11.250
but you need a job,

06:12.750 --> 06:14.208
some responsibility in your life.

06:14.250 --> 06:15.667
Actually, we were just talking about this.

06:17.875 --> 06:19.417
Fong's Market is looking for a new cashier

06:19.458 --> 06:20.417
to fill in on the weekends,

06:20.458 --> 06:22.166
and I put in a good word

06:22.208 --> 06:24.625
for Miss Underemployed over here.

06:24.667 --> 06:25.834
That's amazing.

06:25.875 --> 06:27.333
Do you think she has a shot?

06:27.375 --> 06:28.375
Uh, we don't know yet.

06:28.417 --> 06:29.500
Maybe.

06:29.542 --> 06:31.417
Well, you gotta go out there, you know,

06:31.458 --> 06:32.959
you gotta... show the flag,

06:33.000 --> 06:35.250
let 'em know you want it.

06:35.291 --> 06:37.291
Early bird gets the worm and all that.

06:37.333 --> 06:38.166
Hmm?

06:40.125 --> 06:41.583
Aunt Karen... 'kay.

06:41.625 --> 06:42.875
What?

06:42.917 --> 06:44.417
Did I violate our no-PDA rule?

06:44.458 --> 06:47.000
Because this isn't a public place, you know.

06:47.041 --> 06:49.000
I'd have to check the fine print,

06:49.041 --> 06:50.625
but I'm pretty sure I'm allowed to kiss my niece

06:50.667 --> 06:52.250
in my own kitchen.

06:52.291 --> 06:53.291
Okay.

07:03.875 --> 07:05.083
What are you doing?

07:05.125 --> 07:07.250
Why are you telling her you're getting me a job?

07:07.291 --> 07:08.417
She's going to be wondering

07:08.458 --> 07:10.250
where all the money is coming from.

07:10.291 --> 07:11.625
I figured you might need a cover story.

07:11.667 --> 07:12.542
Okay, no, I told you,

07:12.583 --> 07:14.667
we are not doing that.

07:16.166 --> 07:18.041
See you tomorrow, homegirl.

07:23.166 --> 07:24.333
Dammit.

07:34.166 --> 07:36.041
-Hey, Stephanie. -I love your jeans, Ri.

07:36.083 --> 07:37.875
-Thanks. -They're really cute.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.333
How's it going?

07:40.375 --> 07:41.500
Ah, it's all right.

07:41.542 --> 07:43.000
I've got a math test next, so, you know--

07:43.041 --> 07:44.375
Hey, girls,

07:44.417 --> 07:45.917
Those jeans don't make your ass look fat at all.

07:48.542 --> 07:50.542
Bitch.

07:50.583 --> 07:52.166
Missy Rogers, queen of backhanded compliments.

07:52.208 --> 07:53.250
Right?

07:53.291 --> 07:54.500
You know, the other day

07:54.542 --> 07:56.000
she told me she thought my hair looked nice.

07:56.041 --> 07:57.333
I actually think she was serious--

07:57.375 --> 07:58.125
G'ah!

07:58.166 --> 07:59.458
Hi, Oliver.

07:59.500 --> 08:00.875
Uh, hey, Steph.

08:00.917 --> 08:01.875
I gotta get to class.

08:01.917 --> 08:02.834
I'll see you guys later.

08:02.875 --> 08:04.542
See ya.

08:04.583 --> 08:06.792
Don't forget, <i>it's chess club today in the...</i>

08:06.834 --> 08:07.875
What were you and the Grim Reaper

08:07.917 --> 08:09.083
talking about?

08:09.125 --> 08:11.542
Okay, first, she has cancer,

08:11.583 --> 08:12.834
not the plague.

08:12.875 --> 08:14.000
And she's in what-do-you-call-it,

08:14.041 --> 08:16.166
remission.

08:16.208 --> 08:18.125
Well, speaking of stuff that could kill you,

08:18.166 --> 08:19.375
I think my dad's gonna kill me

08:19.417 --> 08:21.125
when he finds out I'm failing chemistry.

08:21.166 --> 08:22.583
You're not failing chemistry.

08:22.625 --> 08:23.959
I don't know, I think I need a tutor.

08:24.000 --> 08:25.667
Know anyone who might be able to help?

08:25.709 --> 08:26.875
Um...

08:26.917 --> 08:28.000
I'm free at lunch.

08:28.041 --> 08:29.709
Maybe we can put our heads together

08:29.750 --> 08:31.500
and figure something out.

08:31.542 --> 08:32.625
Okay, sounds good.

08:32.667 --> 08:33.417
Okay.

08:33.457 --> 08:34.667
Bye.

08:34.708 --> 08:35.833
Bye.

08:38.082 --> 08:39.375
Riley...

08:39.417 --> 08:42.833
that is nice work, as always.

08:42.875 --> 08:44.375
Erica...

08:44.417 --> 08:46.375
what is wrong now?

08:46.417 --> 08:48.542
Paint under my nails.

08:48.583 --> 08:50.750
Should I call the nurse?

08:50.792 --> 08:52.208
Would you, Tim?

08:52.250 --> 08:54.250
That would be so nice.

08:54.291 --> 08:57.667
That's "Mr. Sylvester" to you.

08:57.709 --> 08:59.333
Oops, my bad.

09:00.583 --> 09:02.083
Say, is there a Mrs. Sylvester?

09:04.625 --> 09:07.792
More work, less chat, please.

09:07.834 --> 09:09.417
Yes, sir. You know...

09:12.083 --> 09:13.834
Tim's pretty hot for an older guy.

09:15.375 --> 09:17.500
Okay...

09:17.542 --> 09:20.333
That's the intaglio printing press.

09:20.375 --> 09:22.500
So?

09:22.542 --> 09:24.750
So that's what they use to print banknotes.

09:24.792 --> 09:26.333
They who?

09:26.375 --> 09:27.834
The Treasury Department.

09:27.875 --> 09:30.250
What, like, a hundred years ago?

09:30.291 --> 09:33.542
Just because it's old doesn't mean it's bad.

09:33.583 --> 09:35.250
It's organic,

09:35.291 --> 09:37.291
and tactile.

09:37.333 --> 09:38.500
It's the difference between real art

09:38.542 --> 09:40.542
and a digital imitation.

09:40.583 --> 09:42.917
Wait, are you saying we could use that to...

09:42.959 --> 09:44.125
You know...

09:44.166 --> 09:45.083
up the quality?

09:45.125 --> 09:46.208
No.

09:46.250 --> 09:48.166
Erica, don't even think about it.

09:48.208 --> 09:49.917
Hey, you're the one who brought it up.

09:49.959 --> 09:51.208
Look, seriously,

09:51.250 --> 09:52.291
we just have to finish this,

09:52.333 --> 09:53.542
okay?

10:02.291 --> 10:04.291
...Many thanks to all students

10:06.375 --> 10:08.750
<i>who have brought non-perishable</i> <i>food items for our Food Bank...</i>

10:08.792 --> 10:10.166
Hey...

10:10.208 --> 10:11.750
what are you listening to?

10:11.792 --> 10:12.750
The White Album.

10:12.792 --> 10:14.792
The what?

10:14.834 --> 10:16.375
Seriously?

10:16.417 --> 10:17.458
you don't know the Beatles?

10:17.500 --> 10:19.250
Of course I do. I thought you were

10:19.291 --> 10:21.041
into vintage music.

10:21.083 --> 10:23.750
I am, I like rock and roll,

10:23.792 --> 10:25.917
The Beatles... not so much.

10:25.959 --> 10:27.083
Ooh, we're going to have a problem.

10:27.125 --> 10:28.250
What?

10:28.291 --> 10:29.542
You're a bigger hipster than I am.

10:29.583 --> 10:30.917
Take that back.

10:30.959 --> 10:32.625
No. Here.

10:32.667 --> 10:33.750
Ow!

10:33.792 --> 10:35.208
Can I borrow your girlfriend?

10:35.250 --> 10:37.458
If you bring her back in one piece.

10:37.500 --> 10:38.709
I just sat down.

10:38.750 --> 10:39.625
It'll just take a second.

10:43.041 --> 10:44.041
What is that?

10:44.083 --> 10:45.291
The key to the art room.

10:46.375 --> 10:47.417
I stole it off Tim

10:47.458 --> 10:48.667
while he was ogling my boobs.

10:48.709 --> 10:50.667
Got Mark to make a copy for me in shop,

10:50.709 --> 10:52.625
and put the original back before he knew it was gone.

10:52.667 --> 10:54.291
You're insane.

10:55.583 --> 10:57.625
Before you get all high and mighty...

10:58.667 --> 11:00.000
What--

11:01.250 --> 11:03.417
Your share of the proceeds.

11:03.458 --> 11:04.500
You were selling my paper?

11:04.542 --> 11:06.041
Our paper.

11:06.083 --> 11:07.458
And no, I'm not that stupid.

11:07.500 --> 11:09.750
I simply sold those new Ralph Lauren dresses

11:09.792 --> 11:11.500
to the glam squad.

11:11.542 --> 11:13.458
Impressed?

11:13.500 --> 11:16.166
You may be on to something.

11:16.208 --> 11:17.667
You may be, too.

11:17.709 --> 11:19.375
Maybe we should just sell our money

11:19.417 --> 11:20.667
to our fellow shopaholics.

11:20.709 --> 11:22.083
Are you crazy?

11:22.125 --> 11:24.291
No, we cannot pass those along to any other kids...

11:24.333 --> 11:25.333
someone will talk.

11:25.375 --> 11:27.792
I was kidding!

11:27.834 --> 11:28.875
Maybe..?

11:28.917 --> 11:30.750
We can't joke about this.

11:30.792 --> 11:33.208
Look, we have to be smart.

11:33.250 --> 11:34.792
So you're still in?

11:36.041 --> 11:37.083
Yes.

11:37.125 --> 11:38.333
I'm still in.

11:38.375 --> 11:40.041
Good.

11:40.083 --> 11:42.500
Now, let's discuss other ways we can "diversify" our income.

11:42.542 --> 11:44.792
Diversify?

11:44.834 --> 11:47.333
Sounds like you two are talking about stocks.

11:47.375 --> 11:48.792
Come on.

11:48.834 --> 11:49.750
You can bring him, too.

11:49.792 --> 11:50.542
Wait, bring him where?

11:50.583 --> 11:52.125
What?

11:53.250 --> 11:54.709
Hey, whoa, whoa, a currency exchange?

11:54.750 --> 11:56.333
Exactly.

11:56.375 --> 11:57.333
All set?

11:57.375 --> 11:58.250
Erica... Erica, no...

11:59.333 --> 12:01.250
Oliver, stay here.

12:01.291 --> 12:02.250
Hold on, guys,

12:02.291 --> 12:03.750
is this going to take long?

12:04.959 --> 12:06.500
Guys?

12:11.333 --> 12:13.000
Don't do this.

12:13.041 --> 12:14.667
Too late.

12:16.750 --> 12:17.709
Hi.

12:17.750 --> 12:18.875
Hi.

12:18.917 --> 12:20.750
Uh, I'm going to Paris next week,

12:20.792 --> 12:22.750
and I would like to buy some Euros, please.

12:22.792 --> 12:24.375
Sure, how much?

12:24.417 --> 12:26.375
Uh, whatever a hundred bucks gets me.

12:27.500 --> 12:28.792
That won't get you very far in France.

12:28.834 --> 12:31.333
It only has to get me to the hotel.

12:31.375 --> 12:33.333
My boyfriend's meeting me there.

12:33.375 --> 12:34.375
He's rich.

12:34.417 --> 12:35.375
And hot.

12:38.834 --> 12:42.583
Well, you're looking at 85 Euros.

12:42.625 --> 12:44.917
So much for the almighty dollar, right?

12:48.667 --> 12:50.583
There you go.

12:54.959 --> 12:56.625
Back in a second.

12:56.667 --> 12:58.000
Take your time.

12:58.041 --> 12:59.417
I'm not in a hurry.

12:59.458 --> 13:00.625
By exchanging our bill

13:00.667 --> 13:01.959
<i>for foreign currency,</i>

13:02.000 --> 13:03.583
<i>Erica knew she had hit</i> <i>on the easiest way</i>

13:03.625 --> 13:05.125
<i>to launder counterfeit money.</i>

13:05.166 --> 13:06.709
<i>But it was a risky plan.</i>

13:06.750 --> 13:07.834
<i>These weren't sales clerks.</i>

13:12.208 --> 13:15.041
50, 60, 70, 85.

13:16.375 --> 13:17.375
There you go.

13:17.417 --> 13:18.208
Thank you very much.

13:18.250 --> 13:19.417
You're welcome.

13:19.458 --> 13:21.041
Is there anything else I can help you with?

13:21.083 --> 13:21.792
Uh, no, thanks.

13:21.834 --> 13:23.917
I think we're good.

13:31.500 --> 13:33.375
I can't believe you did that.

13:33.417 --> 13:34.542
It worked, didn't it?

13:34.583 --> 13:36.166
It worked once.

13:36.208 --> 13:37.291
That doesn't prove anything.

13:37.333 --> 13:38.417
Ri, that woman

13:38.458 --> 13:39.625
probably handles thousands of dollars

13:39.667 --> 13:41.125
every single day,

13:41.166 --> 13:42.417
and she couldn't tell.

13:42.458 --> 13:44.208
Or we just got lucky.

13:44.250 --> 13:46.083
Besides, now we're stuck with Euros.

13:46.125 --> 13:48.166
You have to go to another currency exchange.

13:48.208 --> 13:50.583
You read my mind.

13:52.000 --> 13:53.458
Why do I feel like I'm watching

13:53.500 --> 13:55.834
a foreign movie with no subtitles?

13:57.291 --> 13:59.166
Oliver, we need to talk.

14:01.834 --> 14:03.875
Once we had <i>the real Euros,</i>

14:03.917 --> 14:05.208
<i>the pressure was off.</i>

14:05.250 --> 14:06.625
<i>We could exchange them</i> <i>for U.S. currency</i>

14:06.667 --> 14:08.542
<i>at a different shop.</i>

14:10.500 --> 14:11.750
Voila.

14:11.792 --> 14:14.542
We just cleaned our money.

14:16.542 --> 14:19.041
And made an extra 11%

14:19.083 --> 14:20.959
in the bargain.

14:22.500 --> 14:23.834
Admit it,

14:23.875 --> 14:26.291
we're sitting on a gold mine here.

14:26.333 --> 14:28.083
Will you say something?

14:28.125 --> 14:30.458
You're scaring me.

14:36.208 --> 14:37.583
I can't believe you guys

14:37.625 --> 14:41.041
are counterfeiting hundred-dollar bills.

14:41.083 --> 14:45.917
Well, we'll have to switch over to 20s, but...

14:45.959 --> 14:48.917
it'll be less conspicuous.

14:48.959 --> 14:50.208
Yes.

14:54.625 --> 14:56.500
Okay.

14:56.542 --> 14:57.583
"Okay"?

14:57.625 --> 14:59.500
What does that mean, "okay?"

15:01.291 --> 15:03.000
I'm your boyfriend,

15:03.041 --> 15:05.125
isn't that what I'm supposed to say?

15:05.166 --> 15:08.542
Is this guy for real or what?

15:08.583 --> 15:10.083
Okay, we have class, let's go.

15:11.333 --> 15:13.208
I'm so brilliant.

15:13.250 --> 15:16.792
This imaginary cashier job will be your ultimate cover.

15:16.834 --> 15:18.875
You're so modest.

15:18.917 --> 15:21.542
Hey, we need to jump on this.

15:21.583 --> 15:23.291
Promise me you'll tell your Aunt tonight.

15:23.333 --> 15:24.458
Yeah, I promise.

15:24.500 --> 15:26.500
Good.

15:26.542 --> 15:30.125
She's not just my aunt, okay?

15:30.166 --> 15:31.291
If it wasn't for her,

15:31.333 --> 15:32.875
I'd be in a foster home,

15:32.917 --> 15:34.583
or out on the street somewhere.

15:34.625 --> 15:36.875
Riley... I get it.

15:36.917 --> 15:38.750
She would never risk losing you.

15:40.250 --> 15:43.375
Okay, let's just keep our eyes on the prize.

15:43.417 --> 15:44.834
I still can't believe

15:44.875 --> 15:47.458
we're actually going to do this.

15:47.500 --> 15:48.917
Believe it, Ri.

15:48.959 --> 15:50.750
Your aunt's debts?

15:50.792 --> 15:52.417
Thing of the past.

15:52.458 --> 15:55.000
Welcome to the high life, my friend.

16:44.208 --> 16:45.166
Hey.

16:47.291 --> 16:48.041
You're home.

16:49.375 --> 16:50.667
Hey, did the...

16:50.709 --> 16:52.250
did the life insurance get in?

16:52.291 --> 16:54.250
No, not yet.

16:54.291 --> 16:56.166
They're still blaming the accident

16:56.208 --> 16:58.375
on Uncle Dale.

16:58.417 --> 17:00.250
It'll... It'll work out.

17:00.291 --> 17:02.041
I know, honey.

17:03.166 --> 17:04.709
Hey, I got good news.

17:04.750 --> 17:06.375
I got the job.

17:06.416 --> 17:07.541
Really?

17:07.583 --> 17:09.834
That one that Erica was talking about?

17:09.875 --> 17:11.040
Yeah, they just called a few minutes ago.

17:11.083 --> 17:12.834
When do you start?

17:12.875 --> 17:14.083
Tomorrow. It's a night shift,

17:14.125 --> 17:15.500
so I won't be home for dinner.

17:15.541 --> 17:16.959
Okay.

17:17.000 --> 17:19.125
Well, I just think this is going to be so good for you.

17:19.165 --> 17:20.290
Me too.

17:22.208 --> 17:23.916
You want me to bring you up something?

17:23.959 --> 17:25.416
I have those brownies that you like

17:25.458 --> 17:26.458
in the fridge.

17:26.500 --> 17:27.709
Oh, no, I'm good.

17:27.750 --> 17:29.125
I just had dinner.

17:29.166 --> 17:31.000
Hey...

17:33.750 --> 17:35.542
I know I must seem manic right now.

17:37.500 --> 17:39.000
Things have just been crazy.

17:39.041 --> 17:41.333
But I just want you to know that

17:41.375 --> 17:42.750
if you need to talk,

17:42.792 --> 17:43.750
or anything.

17:43.792 --> 17:44.917
I'll be there.

17:44.959 --> 17:45.959
I know.

17:47.875 --> 17:50.083
I miss Uncle Dale, too.

18:03.875 --> 18:05.375
Hi...

18:05.417 --> 18:06.959
<i>today we're going to be</i> <i>talking about "intah-lio",</i>

18:07.000 --> 18:08.458
<i>or intaglio printing.</i>

18:08.500 --> 18:10.208
<i>That usually involves</i> <i>taking a metal plate,</i>

18:10.250 --> 18:12.291
<i>copper and zinc</i> <i>are most common,</i>

18:12.333 --> 18:16.166
<i>and using it</i> <i>to print on paper...</i>

18:58.875 --> 19:00.208
Hey, where are you off to?

19:00.250 --> 19:01.125
I've got an early shift.

19:02.125 --> 19:03.166
Yeah. I'll see you later.

19:03.208 --> 19:04.166
Good luck.

19:07.583 --> 19:08.625
Hey, Mr. Bernard!

19:08.667 --> 19:10.000
We're just going to be in the art room

19:10.041 --> 19:11.291
working on a project. Mr. Sylvester

19:11.333 --> 19:12.583
know you're here?

19:12.625 --> 19:13.709
You bet.

19:13.750 --> 19:14.875
Gave us the key and everything.

19:26.291 --> 19:28.458
It was a technical process,

19:28.500 --> 19:31.000
<i>but our art department</i> <i>had all the tools.</i>

19:31.041 --> 19:33.458
<i>We made our hundred-dollar</i> <i>printing plate</i>

19:33.500 --> 19:35.291
<i>with photo emulsion</i> <i>and an acid bath.</i>

19:38.291 --> 19:39.625
<i>The Secret Service</i>

19:39.667 --> 19:41.959
<i>made more than 3,600</i> <i>counterfeiting arrests</i>

19:42.000 --> 19:43.875
<i>last year.</i>

19:43.917 --> 19:45.208
<i>It wasn't bad odds</i>

19:45.250 --> 19:46.750
<i>knowing there was</i> <i>a hundred million</i>

19:46.792 --> 19:48.500
<i>in counterfeit currency</i> <i>floating around out there.</i>

19:54.542 --> 19:57.083
<i>Most bills are made</i> <i>with inkjet printers,</i>

19:57.125 --> 19:58.000
<i>but we were old school.</i>

20:00.542 --> 20:02.709
<i>Many of the images</i> <i>on counterfeit money</i>

20:02.750 --> 20:04.667
<i>aren't as crisp</i> <i>as the real deal.</i>

20:06.041 --> 20:08.125
<i>Luckily for us...</i>

20:08.166 --> 20:09.500
<i>eight out of ten store clerks</i>

20:09.542 --> 20:11.041
<i>aren't trained</i> <i>to look for it anymore</i>

20:11.083 --> 20:12.917
<i>since most customers</i> <i>use credit or debit cards.</i>

20:14.041 --> 20:15.458
<i>In the United States,</i>

20:15.500 --> 20:16.959
<i>the $20.00 bill</i>

20:17.000 --> 20:19.500
<i>is the most frequently</i> <i>counterfeited note,</i>

20:19.542 --> 20:21.500
<i>but for the designer shops</i> <i>we liked,</i>

20:21.542 --> 20:23.542
<i>the $100 worked just fine.</i>

20:34.959 --> 20:37.166
Listen, I get that you want to play it safe,

20:37.208 --> 20:39.125
but we need to go back to a currency exchange.

20:39.166 --> 20:40.417
We talked about this.

20:41.333 --> 20:42.834
But the money works!

20:42.875 --> 20:45.000
It's just too big of a risk.

20:45.041 --> 20:46.125
Besides, you said it yourself.

20:46.166 --> 20:47.750
Diversify.

20:47.792 --> 20:50.208
You're so paranoid.

20:53.917 --> 20:56.000
You girls pulling an all-nighter?

20:56.041 --> 20:57.125
Uh... almost done.

20:57.166 --> 20:59.000
Just give us a sec! I wish my daughters

20:59.041 --> 21:00.875
were this dedicated.

21:21.291 --> 21:22.500
Yeah, yeah...

21:32.834 --> 21:33.834
What the hell--?

21:33.875 --> 21:35.542
I'm sorry, Mr. Sylvester.

21:35.583 --> 21:36.834
This is strike two,

21:36.875 --> 21:38.166
I gotta send a message.

21:38.208 --> 21:39.667
You're all right.

21:39.709 --> 21:41.125
Message received.

21:41.166 --> 21:42.917
They're gonna need their principal back

21:42.959 --> 21:44.959
by the close of business on Saturday.

21:45.000 --> 21:46.083
Yeah.

21:46.125 --> 21:47.750
Hey, hey...

21:47.792 --> 21:49.542
And plus 20% interest.

21:49.583 --> 21:50.542
Understand?

21:50.583 --> 21:52.792
Yeah.

21:52.834 --> 21:57.333
I advise... you not make me come back here.

21:57.375 --> 21:58.458
Okay. Have a nice day.

22:00.667 --> 22:02.083
Thank you.

22:14.166 --> 22:15.709
Morning, Mr. Sylvester.

22:15.750 --> 22:16.750
Oh, hey, Joe.

22:16.792 --> 22:17.667
Watch your step there.

22:17.709 --> 22:19.083
Thanks.

22:19.125 --> 22:20.834
Got yourself a couple of real keeners there, eh?

22:20.875 --> 22:21.834
Hmm?

22:21.875 --> 22:23.250
Riley and Erica.

22:23.291 --> 22:24.667
They were here pretty late last night.

22:24.709 --> 22:25.959
Whatever you've got them working on,

22:26.000 --> 22:27.208
I bet it's going to look great.

23:17.291 --> 23:18.542
Our fellow students

23:18.583 --> 23:19.792
<i>were the easiest way</i>

23:19.834 --> 23:21.208
<i>to sell our purchases</i> <i>for hard cash.</i>

23:21.250 --> 23:23.208
<i>Top sellers--</i>

23:23.250 --> 23:26.458
<i>jewellery and brand-name shoes</i> <i>at a 75% discount.</i>

23:26.500 --> 23:27.959
<i>Not big profit margins,</i>

23:28.000 --> 23:29.959
<i>but it was</i> <i>a quick turnaround...</i>

23:34.709 --> 23:35.750
Boo!

23:35.792 --> 23:37.375
Don't do that.

23:37.417 --> 23:38.542
Rough night, Michelangelo?

23:38.583 --> 23:39.834
Yes.

23:39.875 --> 23:41.458
If I have to look at another Ben Franklin image,

23:41.500 --> 23:43.291
I am going to hurl.

23:43.333 --> 23:44.458
Yeah?

23:45.458 --> 23:47.333
Well, how do you feel about Grant?

23:48.583 --> 23:49.959
I stopped by the currency exchange before school--

23:50.000 --> 23:51.041
You promised me.

23:51.083 --> 23:53.125
But it was so easy.

23:53.166 --> 23:55.834
I cannot believe you went behind my back.

23:55.875 --> 23:57.083
Don't be mad--

23:57.125 --> 23:58.375
Mad, Erica?

23:58.417 --> 24:00.750
No, okay, you could go to jail.

24:00.792 --> 24:02.000
I could go to jail.

24:02.041 --> 24:03.500
But we're not gonna,

24:03.542 --> 24:06.041
simply because we're too awesome.

24:08.083 --> 24:09.834
Here's your share from last night.

24:09.875 --> 24:10.834
What do you think, partner?

24:10.875 --> 24:11.917
I think you should stop

24:11.959 --> 24:13.375
flashing around huge amounts of cash

24:13.417 --> 24:15.583
like you're an ATM.

24:15.625 --> 24:16.667
Hey, guys.

24:16.709 --> 24:17.667
Hey.

24:17.709 --> 24:19.041
Erica, I love this necklace.

24:19.083 --> 24:20.125
Thank you so much.

24:20.166 --> 24:22.375
Looking great, Steph.

24:25.917 --> 24:28.250
You bought her a necklace?

24:28.291 --> 24:30.667
What was I going to do, buy her a hairclip?

24:30.709 --> 24:32.000
I was feeling flush,

24:32.041 --> 24:33.875
and I felt like doing something nice for someone,

24:33.917 --> 24:34.917
so sue me.

24:34.959 --> 24:37.083
Look, just promise me,

24:37.125 --> 24:38.959
no more currency exchanges,

24:39.000 --> 24:40.959
no more expensive gifts.

24:41.041 --> 24:42.208
We can't afford

24:42.250 --> 24:44.166
to draw attention like this to ourselves.

24:44.208 --> 24:45.500
Okay, just stick with the plan.

24:45.542 --> 24:47.458
Okay, okay.

24:47.500 --> 24:50.375
Just dial down the drama... please.

24:52.792 --> 24:55.250
If that's loverboy, save your strength.

24:55.291 --> 24:58.041
We've got another late one tonight.

25:04.917 --> 25:05.875
Hey...

25:05.917 --> 25:06.750
what's up?

25:06.792 --> 25:08.250
Hey, are you okay?

25:08.291 --> 25:10.333
Yeah, I'm fine, why?

25:10.375 --> 25:12.083
Uh...

25:12.125 --> 25:14.542
I... I just called you last night,

25:14.583 --> 25:16.083
and you didn't pick up.

25:16.125 --> 25:18.875
Oh, yeah, sorry, I was working.

25:18.917 --> 25:19.875
Working?

25:19.917 --> 25:21.208
Yeah.

25:21.250 --> 25:24.208
Working-working, or...?

25:24.250 --> 25:25.667
Okay, Ollie, I'm gonna be late for third period,

25:25.709 --> 25:26.625
what is it?

25:28.208 --> 25:30.166
This thing with Erica...

25:30.208 --> 25:31.667
I thought you said you were okay with that.

25:31.709 --> 25:33.208
I just want to make sure

25:33.250 --> 25:35.291
you know what you're getting yourself into here.

25:35.333 --> 25:37.166
What do you want me to say?

25:37.208 --> 25:39.875
In the last week, I've made over three grand.

25:39.917 --> 25:43.083
Come on, Ri, you're too smart to fall for this.

25:43.125 --> 25:44.917
Why can't you see what's going on here?

25:44.959 --> 25:46.041
What don't I see?

25:46.083 --> 25:47.083
What could happen.

25:47.125 --> 25:48.083
What's going to happen.

25:48.125 --> 25:49.041
What could happen to you.

25:49.083 --> 25:50.709
What could happen to me?

25:53.375 --> 25:54.917
Never mind.

25:54.959 --> 25:56.709
Forget it, forget I mentioned it, okay, yeah?

25:56.750 --> 25:57.667
Just...

25:57.709 --> 25:59.875
Okay.

25:59.917 --> 26:01.917
Okay...

26:01.959 --> 26:03.834
Do you trust me?

26:04.750 --> 26:06.875
Yeah.

26:06.917 --> 26:08.458
Yeah, of course.

26:08.500 --> 26:09.500
Then let me do this.

26:13.041 --> 26:14.750
Just promise me if anything goes wrong,

26:14.792 --> 26:16.250
anything,

26:16.291 --> 26:20.166
you'll turn around and never look back, okay?

26:21.250 --> 26:22.166
I promise.

26:24.625 --> 26:25.542
Okay.

26:38.291 --> 26:40.250
Oliver, you are going to love this album.

27:00.750 --> 27:02.625
Hi...

27:02.667 --> 27:04.792
I'm here about the album?

27:05.834 --> 27:06.959
Yeah.

27:07.000 --> 27:07.959
Follow me.

27:15.458 --> 27:16.333
I just keep all my albums

27:16.375 --> 27:17.750
in the back here.

27:28.583 --> 27:29.792
Tangerine Vector, right?

27:29.834 --> 27:30.959
Yeah.

27:35.208 --> 27:36.166
Awesome-- Uh-uh-uh...

27:37.208 --> 27:38.125
Cash first.

27:40.583 --> 27:42.417
You like the classics, huh?

27:42.458 --> 27:44.083
Yeah, my boyfriend does.

27:44.125 --> 27:46.792
Lucky guy.

27:46.834 --> 27:49.542
Yeah, he's going to love this.

27:53.458 --> 27:54.667
I heard it's a collector's item.

27:54.709 --> 27:56.875
Where'd you get it?

27:56.917 --> 27:58.417
Tower Records.

28:05.166 --> 28:06.458
Thanks.

28:06.500 --> 28:08.083
Hey.

28:08.125 --> 28:09.959
What's your hurry?

28:10.041 --> 28:12.375
I gotta get to school.

28:12.417 --> 28:13.792
Can you let go of me, please?

28:13.834 --> 28:15.166
Your mom know you're meeting strange men

28:15.208 --> 28:16.000
in chop shops?

28:17.583 --> 28:18.667
'Cause I won't tell if you won't...

28:18.709 --> 28:19.792
Let go, prick.

28:22.166 --> 28:24.792
Yeah, I probably deserved that.

28:24.834 --> 28:26.125
But we're good, right?

28:27.959 --> 28:29.458
Yeah, we're good.

28:34.458 --> 28:35.375
Son of a...

28:35.417 --> 28:36.375
Hey!

28:37.750 --> 28:39.792
You trying to rip me off, you little tease?

28:39.834 --> 28:40.625
Come here!

29:29.834 --> 29:30.750
Dammit.

29:34.291 --> 29:36.417
You sure you're

29:43.583 --> 29:45.709
going to be okay?

29:45.750 --> 29:47.166
Yeah.

29:47.208 --> 29:48.750
Thanks for picking me up.

29:48.792 --> 29:50.750
Anytime, okay?

29:50.792 --> 29:52.250
Just don't let your aunt see that hip,

29:52.291 --> 29:54.542
or she'll have an aneurysm.

29:54.583 --> 29:57.083
He could have killed me, you know.

29:57.125 --> 29:59.250
Well, next time you arrange to meet some jerk

29:59.291 --> 30:01.000
to buy stolen property,

30:01.041 --> 30:02.959
bring along some back-up.

30:06.709 --> 30:09.917
50,000 volts buys a lot of peace of mind.

30:11.792 --> 30:14.375
We really are criminals now, aren't we?

30:14.417 --> 30:16.458
Just like Thelma and Louise.

30:17.959 --> 30:19.625
Thelma and Louise drove off a cliff.

30:19.667 --> 30:22.041
They died doing what they love.

30:22.083 --> 30:23.000
Right.

30:25.375 --> 30:26.917
See you tomorrow, partner.

30:51.709 --> 30:53.083
You know, it's been over a week,

30:53.125 --> 30:55.041
and you haven't told me anything about the new job.

30:56.625 --> 30:57.583
It's great. It's going great.

30:58.625 --> 31:00.333
Glad to hear it.

31:00.375 --> 31:01.959
Are you working with Erica?

31:02.000 --> 31:05.125
No. Different shifts.

31:05.166 --> 31:06.291
When I was your age,

31:06.333 --> 31:08.333
I was stocking shelves at a Home Depot,

31:08.375 --> 31:10.667
but I've never worked at a grocery store.

31:10.709 --> 31:13.333
Do we really have to talk about this?

31:13.375 --> 31:15.667
I mean, I don't really want to talk about work right now.

31:15.709 --> 31:18.083
Okay.

31:18.125 --> 31:19.792
Just making conversation.

31:25.166 --> 31:28.875
You want to hear something crazy?

31:28.917 --> 31:30.375
I checked my credit card account today,

31:30.417 --> 31:33.291
and the computer says my balance is zero.

31:33.333 --> 31:36.375
Zip. Nada.

31:36.417 --> 31:38.208
Oh, man, can you believe that?

31:38.250 --> 31:40.208
That must have been one hell of a computer glitch.

31:41.542 --> 31:42.208
That's pretty lucky.

31:42.250 --> 31:43.542
Yeah.

31:43.583 --> 31:45.458
Except for now I'm going to have to go to the bank

31:45.500 --> 31:46.750
and clear it up.

31:46.792 --> 31:48.834
Are you serious?

31:48.875 --> 31:50.834
Well, yeah.

31:50.875 --> 31:53.166
Can't just not say anything.

31:53.208 --> 31:54.625
Why not?

31:54.667 --> 31:55.792
The bank can afford it.

31:57.208 --> 31:59.458
What if tomorrow that same computer glitch

31:59.500 --> 32:02.083
took away some grandmother's life savings?

32:02.125 --> 32:05.959
It's dishonest, Riley.

32:06.000 --> 32:08.500
Your Uncle Dale would have never taken money

32:08.542 --> 32:09.625
that didn't belong to him,

32:09.667 --> 32:12.959
and neither will I.

32:14.458 --> 32:16.875
Riley?

32:16.917 --> 32:20.250
But it's okay if we lose the house?

32:20.291 --> 32:22.583
Honey...

32:22.625 --> 32:25.417
I'll admit things have been difficult,

32:25.458 --> 32:27.583
but we are not losing this house,

32:27.625 --> 32:29.458
I promise you.

32:29.500 --> 32:31.083
Things are not that bad.

32:31.125 --> 32:32.750
Would you tell me if they were?

32:35.792 --> 32:37.041
That's what I thought.

32:40.375 --> 32:41.417
Look, can I be excused?

32:41.458 --> 32:43.250
I have homework to do.

32:43.291 --> 32:44.875
Sure.

33:01.542 --> 33:02.625
Honey...

33:02.667 --> 33:03.792
are you okay?

33:06.333 --> 33:08.375
Riley...

33:14.250 --> 33:16.792
Riley?

33:22.959 --> 33:24.333
Riley, are you in there?

33:24.375 --> 33:25.542
Yeah, I'm fine.

33:25.583 --> 33:26.667
Don't come in.

33:28.291 --> 33:31.417
I said don't come in.

33:31.458 --> 33:32.959
Don't be stupid, you're bleeding!

33:34.041 --> 33:35.417
It's fine, don't worry--

33:35.458 --> 33:37.083
Stay still.

33:48.250 --> 33:49.959
Now tell me what happened.

33:50.000 --> 33:52.208
I just fell in art class.

33:52.250 --> 33:53.917
And hit what?

33:53.959 --> 33:56.041
A printing press.

33:56.083 --> 33:57.834
It's just stupid.

33:57.875 --> 34:00.291
Well, why didn't you say something to me at dinner?

34:01.417 --> 34:03.583
Because I didn't want you to freak out.

34:03.625 --> 34:04.542
Like you're doing now.

34:04.583 --> 34:05.625
Well...

34:05.667 --> 34:07.000
that looks really bad.

34:07.041 --> 34:08.375
I think we should go to the free clinic--

34:08.417 --> 34:09.833
It looks worse than it is,

34:09.875 --> 34:11.542
seriously.

34:11.583 --> 34:12.833
Well, you can't go to work like that.

34:12.875 --> 34:14.083
I'll call your boss,

34:14.125 --> 34:15.291
and tell him you're not coming in tomorrow--

34:15.333 --> 34:17.875
No! God, why do you have to be so dramatic?

34:17.917 --> 34:19.458
You're not my mother.

34:21.500 --> 34:24.083
Oh, now I'm the dramatic one?

34:24.125 --> 34:26.375
What is going on with you lately?

34:26.417 --> 34:27.750
Riley!

35:28.458 --> 35:29.959
Good morning, everyone.

35:30.000 --> 35:31.792
Can I have your attention, please?

35:33.291 --> 35:35.875
Some of you may be aware of this already,

35:35.917 --> 35:38.667
but for those who aren't...

35:38.709 --> 35:40.625
one of our own,

35:40.667 --> 35:42.208
Stephanie Summers,

35:42.250 --> 35:44.291
died last night in hospital.

35:44.333 --> 35:46.959
As most of you know,

35:47.000 --> 35:47.959
she's been battling cancer

35:48.041 --> 35:49.458
for some time,

35:49.500 --> 35:51.792
and I'm told she was brave until the end,

35:51.834 --> 35:53.834
which won't surprise those of us

35:53.875 --> 35:56.667
who were lucky enough to call her a friend.

35:58.208 --> 35:59.542
I'm sure you all are feeling just as shocked

35:59.583 --> 36:01.583
as I am right now,

36:01.625 --> 36:03.875
and anyone who wants to talk about it

36:03.917 --> 36:05.041
can come to me,

36:05.083 --> 36:07.667
or Mr. Braverman the school counselor.

36:07.709 --> 36:09.834
Also, Stephanie's parents

36:09.875 --> 36:12.000
are setting up a memorial fund

36:12.041 --> 36:13.583
in her name,

36:13.625 --> 36:16.041
and we encourage you and your families

36:16.083 --> 36:18.208
to give as much as you can

36:18.250 --> 36:19.792
to help fight this terrible disease.

36:34.750 --> 36:36.166
Erica...

36:39.041 --> 36:41.041
do you have a minute to chat?

36:41.083 --> 36:42.125
Sure.

36:44.834 --> 36:47.291
Of course, Mr. Sylvester.

37:08.333 --> 37:11.250
I know what you and Riley have been up to

37:11.291 --> 37:14.709
in my classroom after hours.

37:14.750 --> 37:16.208
I don't know what you're talking about--

37:18.166 --> 37:20.458
What are you doing?

37:20.500 --> 37:23.500
What am I doing?

37:23.542 --> 37:28.000
Well, I'm not running a counterfeiting operation

37:28.041 --> 37:31.625
in a public school, for one thing.

37:34.625 --> 37:37.625
What do you want?

37:43.625 --> 37:46.500
I think you know what I want.

37:55.125 --> 37:56.792
What do you think I should do?

37:56.834 --> 37:58.542
You already know what I think you should do.

37:59.709 --> 38:01.375
Well, I want to hear you say it.

38:01.417 --> 38:02.834
What did I tell you last week?

38:02.875 --> 38:04.166
I said, if anything even feels wrong,

38:04.208 --> 38:05.750
you get out, quick.

38:05.792 --> 38:07.792
This isn't worth going to jail for.

38:07.834 --> 38:09.500
It's not that easy.

38:09.542 --> 38:11.500
Yes-- yes, it is.

38:11.542 --> 38:12.750
Stop printing money,

38:12.792 --> 38:14.875
go back to being the hottest girl in 12th grade.

38:14.917 --> 38:17.500
Wow, seriously?

38:17.542 --> 38:21.583
That... You know that's...

38:22.625 --> 38:25.000
Listen, what's the real issue here?

38:25.041 --> 38:26.083
I mean, I get it,

38:26.125 --> 38:27.208
this thing with Stephanie

38:27.250 --> 38:28.500
it's getting to everyone's heads, but--

38:28.542 --> 38:31.166
It's not about Stephanie.

38:31.208 --> 38:32.250
It's Erica.

38:32.291 --> 38:34.917
Look, I don't know,

38:34.959 --> 38:37.709
this is more than making ends meet for her,

38:37.750 --> 38:39.458
it's like a crusade.

38:39.500 --> 38:42.166
Yesterday, she compared us to Thelma and Louise.

38:42.208 --> 38:43.834
I've seen that movie.

38:43.875 --> 38:45.166
They drove off the cliff in the end.

38:45.208 --> 38:47.083
I know.

38:51.583 --> 38:53.333
So tell her what you just told me.

38:53.375 --> 38:55.166
I already did.

38:55.208 --> 38:56.709
She told me to buy a Taser.

38:56.750 --> 38:57.792
Seriously?

38:57.834 --> 38:59.625
Yeah.

39:01.500 --> 39:04.709
Look, you print the money, right?

39:04.750 --> 39:07.458
So stop.

39:07.500 --> 39:09.875
She'll have to be cool with it.

39:10.875 --> 39:11.917
Right?

39:11.959 --> 39:13.208
Yeah, I don't know,

39:13.250 --> 39:14.667
I don't think she cares about getting caught.

39:14.709 --> 39:15.959
Like, whatever happens happens,

39:16.000 --> 39:18.667
and if she leaves a beautiful corpse behind,

39:18.709 --> 39:19.709
even better.

39:21.417 --> 39:24.000
Okay, well...

39:24.041 --> 39:25.417
whatever you choose,

39:25.458 --> 39:26.542
I've got your back,

39:26.583 --> 39:27.792
okay?

39:27.834 --> 39:29.125
Thanks.

39:33.959 --> 39:35.458
Any time.

39:49.834 --> 39:52.625
Fong's Groceries?

39:52.667 --> 39:53.709
Hi.

39:53.750 --> 39:55.834
Could I speak to Kumail, please?

39:57.458 --> 39:59.083
Hey, Kumail, this is Karen Cartwright,

39:59.125 --> 40:00.792
Riley's guardian.

40:00.834 --> 40:03.375
I just wanted to make sure that she called you about her leg,

40:03.417 --> 40:06.250
and needing to take some time off this week?

40:07.750 --> 40:09.834
Well, no, you must have.

40:09.875 --> 40:13.041
She's been working there about a week now.

40:13.083 --> 40:14.750
Uh...

40:14.792 --> 40:18.583
Not unless there's another Fong's Groceries.

40:20.208 --> 40:21.417
Wait, okay, are you telling me you don't have

40:21.458 --> 40:22.667
a Riley Cartwright

40:22.709 --> 40:24.375
working there?

40:24.417 --> 40:27.208
She's 17, she has brown hair...

40:30.834 --> 40:32.291
Okay.

40:32.333 --> 40:33.542
Um, thank you.

40:33.583 --> 40:35.500
I'm sorry for bothering you.

41:00.333 --> 41:01.583
What?

41:25.542 --> 41:28.667
Where are you going?

41:58.250 --> 42:00.291
What are we doing here anyways?

42:00.333 --> 42:02.583
I just wanted to talk.

42:02.625 --> 42:05.709
Riley Cartwright...

42:05.750 --> 42:08.041
I knew you were gifted,

42:08.083 --> 42:10.166
but printing funny money behind my back?

42:17.583 --> 42:18.709
I swear, I just came here

42:18.750 --> 42:20.208
to tell her that I'm out.

42:20.250 --> 42:22.083
Stop?

42:22.125 --> 42:24.083
Someone with your skills?

42:24.125 --> 42:25.208
Sweetheart, if you stopped,

42:25.250 --> 42:27.834
it would be a crime of wasted potential.

42:33.792 --> 42:36.041
Okay, then what do you want?

42:36.083 --> 42:39.709
50 grand.

42:39.750 --> 42:40.917
Fif...

42:40.959 --> 42:43.000
That's a lot.

42:43.041 --> 42:45.125
Look, I don't care where the cash comes from

42:45.166 --> 42:46.375
so long as it's clean.

42:46.417 --> 42:48.417
So you figure out a way to make it happen,

42:48.458 --> 42:50.667
or I drop a dime on your little business venture,

42:50.709 --> 42:52.125
and you can get your high school diploma

42:52.166 --> 42:53.333
from prison.

42:55.208 --> 42:56.625
Hey!

42:57.625 --> 42:58.500
Aunt Karen?

42:58.542 --> 43:00.458
Get away from them!

43:02.000 --> 43:04.041
You've got until Wednesday.

43:05.834 --> 43:07.458
See you in class.

43:20.041 --> 43:20.917
Are you okay?

43:20.959 --> 43:21.834
Yeah.

43:21.875 --> 43:23.166
Did he hurt you?

43:23.208 --> 43:24.375
No, he's just a weirdo.

43:24.417 --> 43:25.959
It happens.

43:26.000 --> 43:28.709
Erica, is that true?

43:28.750 --> 43:29.792
Yeah.

43:29.834 --> 43:31.333
Yeah, it was my bad,

43:31.375 --> 43:33.291
I made fun of his lame pick-up line.

43:33.333 --> 43:34.417
Listen, I gotta go.

43:34.458 --> 43:36.041
I'll talk to you later.

43:37.583 --> 43:39.291
What is wrong with you?

43:39.333 --> 43:41.083
You obviously know that guy,

43:41.125 --> 43:42.375
and you lied to me about your job.

43:42.417 --> 43:43.458
Wait, what?

43:43.500 --> 43:45.125
When did I lie to you about my job?

43:45.166 --> 43:46.333
I called the store.

43:46.375 --> 43:49.000
They've never heard of you.

43:49.041 --> 43:51.542
Why won't you just tell me what's going on?

43:53.709 --> 43:56.625
Look, I'll see you at home.

43:58.208 --> 43:59.959
Riley...

44:00.000 --> 44:02.917
Riley, please don't shut me out like this.

44:08.417 --> 44:10.125
So we can't go the cops?

44:10.166 --> 44:12.041
No, that would kind of defeat the purpose.

44:12.083 --> 44:14.250
There's got to be something we can do

44:14.291 --> 44:16.250
I mean, he's an art teacher,

44:16.291 --> 44:17.959
he's not exactly Al Capone.

44:18.000 --> 44:20.583
Yeah, there is something we can do.

44:20.625 --> 44:23.208
We can get him his 50 grand.

44:25.000 --> 44:27.417
You know it's not going to stop with just that, right?

44:27.458 --> 44:30.542
We gotta do something now,

44:30.583 --> 44:31.417
before it's too late.

44:31.458 --> 44:32.583
"We"?

44:32.625 --> 44:34.583
Oliver, you're not a part of this.

44:34.625 --> 44:35.542
What are you talking about?

44:35.583 --> 44:36.542
Of course I am,

44:36.583 --> 44:37.834
I'm your boyfriend.

44:39.750 --> 44:43.750
Which is why...

44:43.792 --> 44:46.667
I think for now...

44:46.709 --> 44:49.166
you should just stay away from me.

44:50.208 --> 44:52.083
What?

44:52.125 --> 44:54.834
I'm serious, Oliver.

44:56.250 --> 44:58.333
For how long?

44:58.375 --> 44:59.375
I don't know.

45:01.375 --> 45:02.917
Until this is over.

45:02.959 --> 45:04.834
The way it's going,

45:04.875 --> 45:07.750
it's never going to be over, Ri.

45:07.792 --> 45:10.792
You have to make a stand.

45:10.834 --> 45:12.834
I think you should leave.

45:12.875 --> 45:14.417
No, I'm not leaving.

45:14.458 --> 45:15.750
Not like this.

45:15.792 --> 45:18.083
Okay, Oliver, just... Please stop--

45:18.125 --> 45:19.959
Ri, don't push me away.

45:20.000 --> 45:20.959
No--

Good news.

46:27.709 --> 46:30.542
My request for funding has finally come through,

46:30.583 --> 46:31.709
so I have taken the liberty

46:31.750 --> 46:33.333
of bringing our printmaking facilities

46:33.375 --> 46:35.750
into the 21st Century.

46:35.792 --> 46:38.792
We have got an image setter,

46:38.834 --> 46:40.625
a plate processor...

46:40.667 --> 46:41.792
Everything you need

46:43.000 --> 46:46.000
to make high-quality reproductions.

46:50.875 --> 46:53.750
I look forward to seeing what you guys can do.

48:09.625 --> 48:12.041
You gotta be kidding me.

48:26.625 --> 48:28.000
What'd you tell your aunt?

48:28.041 --> 48:29.125
That we're job hunting,

48:29.166 --> 48:30.458
for real this time. Good one.

48:31.834 --> 48:32.959
So, how long

48:33.000 --> 48:34.041
do you think it's going to take

48:34.083 --> 48:36.375
to get this thing up and running?

48:36.417 --> 48:39.041
Erica, what happened yesterday?

48:40.709 --> 48:43.166
You mean, how did he find us?

48:43.208 --> 48:45.834
For starters, yeah.

48:45.875 --> 48:47.583
What difference does it make?

48:47.625 --> 48:50.500
What difference does it make? He's blackmailing us,

48:50.542 --> 48:53.417
and you're okay with that?

48:53.458 --> 48:56.417
Maybe this will be good for us.

48:56.458 --> 48:57.834
What?

48:57.875 --> 48:59.083
Think about it.

48:59.125 --> 49:01.291
Now we've got a teacher on our side.

49:01.333 --> 49:02.834
If anyone asks what we're doing here,

49:02.875 --> 49:04.333
he can cover for us.

49:04.375 --> 49:06.041
Erica, we have to start thinking about

49:06.083 --> 49:08.583
how we're going to get out of this situation.

49:08.625 --> 49:10.083
How do you suggest we do that, huh?

49:10.125 --> 49:12.417
There's no getting out of this, Riley.

49:12.458 --> 49:13.667
Think!

49:13.709 --> 49:15.834
You have to stop seeing problems everywhere

49:15.875 --> 49:17.125
and start seeing opportunities.

49:17.166 --> 49:18.083
-Opportunities? -Yes!

49:18.125 --> 49:19.750
Look, how is this any different

49:19.792 --> 49:21.667
than what we've already been doing?

49:21.709 --> 49:23.375
We're criminals, right?

49:23.417 --> 49:25.667
So let's at least be smart ones.

49:25.709 --> 49:27.417
And he's invested now.

49:27.458 --> 49:28.583
He's not going to do anything

49:28.625 --> 49:31.333
to jeopardize his big payday.

49:31.375 --> 49:34.625
And if this works out, he's going to want more.

49:34.667 --> 49:37.166
We keep making money, he takes a cut,

49:37.208 --> 49:38.166
everybody gets what they want.

49:38.208 --> 49:39.834
Okay...

49:39.875 --> 49:42.083
how close are you two getting?

49:42.125 --> 49:45.750
Please don't tell me you're having sex with him.

49:45.792 --> 49:47.834
You're making it sound creepy,

49:47.875 --> 49:49.959
but he really cares about me.

49:50.000 --> 49:52.417
I cannot believe you're making me do this.

49:52.458 --> 49:54.709
I'm not making you do anything, Ri!

49:54.750 --> 49:56.000
Stop trying to blame other people

49:56.041 --> 49:57.417
every time something doesn't go your way.

49:58.875 --> 50:00.750
Look, he wants his money by tomorrow night,

50:00.792 --> 50:03.333
so can we please just get this done?

51:20.291 --> 51:22.291
Financial institutions

51:22.333 --> 51:24.792
<i>are required to report</i> <i>any transactions over 10 grand</i>

51:24.834 --> 51:26.375
<i>to the government</i>

51:26.417 --> 51:27.959
<i>to stay anonymous.</i>

51:28.000 --> 51:29.458
<i>It's called "smurfing,"</i> <i>I googled it.</i>

51:32.166 --> 51:33.458
<i>We never went to banks.</i>

51:33.500 --> 51:35.083
<i>They have standardized</i> <i>bill-counting machines</i>

51:35.125 --> 51:37.083
<i>with anti-counterfeit features.</i>

51:37.125 --> 51:39.959
<i>Currency exchanges</i> <i>in low-traffic areas</i>

51:40.000 --> 51:41.792
<i>were our main target.</i>

51:41.834 --> 51:43.000
<i>They still count by hand,</i>

51:43.041 --> 51:45.333
<i>and only use</i> <i>ultra-violet detection</i>

51:45.375 --> 51:47.166

<i>For us,</i>

51:50.041 --> 51:51.792
<i>our best cover was a smile</i> <i>and a polite "thank you."</i>

51:53.000 --> 51:54.166
Hi.

51:54.208 --> 51:55.291
I'd like to get

51:55.333 --> 51:57.792
this... amount of money

51:57.834 --> 51:59.125
in U.S. dollars, please?

51:59.166 --> 52:00.500
Certainly.

52:01.625 --> 52:04.041
Excuse me a moment.

52:18.500 --> 52:20.166
Ma'am?

52:20.208 --> 52:21.583
I'm Special Agent Peterson,

52:21.625 --> 52:24.417
this is Special Agent Pankow.

52:24.458 --> 52:26.583
We're with the Secret Service,

52:26.625 --> 52:29.083
Financial Crimes Task Force.

52:29.125 --> 52:30.667
I'm going to need to see some identification.

52:32.542 --> 52:34.375
I'm sorry, I'm going to be late for an appointment.

52:35.458 --> 52:37.291
Oh, hey--

52:37.333 --> 52:39.000
You...

52:39.041 --> 52:40.000
Hey, hey, hey--

52:40.041 --> 52:42.041
stay back.

52:42.083 --> 52:43.625
Federal Agent! Freeze!

52:43.667 --> 52:44.542
Whoa, whoa, whoa--

52:44.583 --> 52:45.625
-Back up! -Keep him there.

52:48.291 --> 52:49.500
Hey!

53:09.709 --> 53:10.542
Food court elevator.

53:10.583 --> 53:11.500
Got it!

53:20.417 --> 53:22.375
She's heading to the courtyard. Level one.

53:28.875 --> 53:29.709
Go! Go, go!

53:29.750 --> 53:30.667
What's going on?

53:30.709 --> 53:31.542
Just drive!

53:31.583 --> 53:32.542
Okay.

53:37.250 --> 53:38.959
Damn it.

53:44.083 --> 53:45.583
Ri, come on, you're going to give yourself a stroke

53:45.625 --> 53:46.792
if you don't calm down, okay?

53:46.834 --> 53:47.750
You're safe now.

53:47.792 --> 53:48.959
Okay.

53:54.917 --> 53:56.583
What the hell happened back there?

53:56.625 --> 53:58.083
Secret Service agents.

53:58.125 --> 54:00.500
The clerk at the exchange probably gave us up.

54:00.542 --> 54:02.250
I told you it was too risky

54:02.291 --> 54:04.208
to go to the same places.

54:04.250 --> 54:06.458
Okay, but you got the money, right?

54:06.500 --> 54:09.792
No, I don't have the money.

54:09.834 --> 54:11.750
Okay, but you still have the Euros, don't you?

54:11.792 --> 54:13.625
I lost my purse.

54:15.291 --> 54:16.917
That means we're still 10,000 short!

54:16.959 --> 54:18.208
I know.

54:18.250 --> 54:19.166
Tim needs his money by tonight!

54:19.208 --> 54:20.834
We don't have time to print more!

54:20.875 --> 54:22.208
I shouldn't have ran!

54:22.250 --> 54:23.959
I should've just let them take me in!

54:24.000 --> 54:27.667
But that guy who chased me showed up, and I panicked!

54:27.709 --> 54:28.875
Are you crazy? If you let them

54:28.917 --> 54:30.083
take you in,

54:30.125 --> 54:32.208
you'd be sitting in a prison cell right now.

54:32.250 --> 54:34.333
You did the only thing you could, Ri.

54:34.375 --> 54:35.375
Don't you get it?

54:35.417 --> 54:36.500
I ran.

54:36.542 --> 54:39.000
They saw me.

54:39.041 --> 54:41.542
They saw you wearing a wig.

54:41.583 --> 54:42.625
Was your I.D. in your purse?

54:43.542 --> 54:45.291
No.

54:45.333 --> 54:46.667
-Thank God... -Okay.

54:46.709 --> 54:48.625
Hey, they don't know who we are.

54:48.667 --> 54:50.333
If they did, they'd be here right now,

54:50.375 --> 54:51.417
wouldn't they?

54:53.291 --> 54:54.792
Okay.

54:54.834 --> 54:57.208
Here's what's going to happen.

54:57.250 --> 54:58.792
We're going to go inside,

54:58.834 --> 55:00.000
we're going to call Tim,

55:00.041 --> 55:02.792
and I'm going to smooth things over with him.

55:02.834 --> 55:03.959
Are you with me?

55:05.709 --> 55:06.667
Riley, are you with me!

55:06.709 --> 55:08.166
Yes! Yes. Yeah...

55:08.208 --> 55:09.041
Okay, come on.

55:28.250 --> 55:30.083
You're home early.

55:30.125 --> 55:32.417
Erica, I'm glad you're here,

55:32.458 --> 55:34.250
the three of us need to have a chat.

55:34.291 --> 55:36.542
Actually, we were just leaving.

55:37.875 --> 55:39.375
No...

55:39.417 --> 55:41.083
-No? -I can't do this anymore.

55:41.125 --> 55:42.083
We have to tell her.

55:42.125 --> 55:43.125
Tell me about what?

55:43.166 --> 55:45.000
About this?

55:46.333 --> 55:48.959
Tell me this is not what it looks like.

55:49.000 --> 55:51.083
Tell me this is not how my credit cards

55:51.125 --> 55:52.041
got paid off.

55:55.291 --> 55:57.041
Actually, it's...

55:57.083 --> 55:58.750
it's worse.

56:02.417 --> 56:03.750
Who are you calling?

56:03.792 --> 56:05.041
Barb from the PTA, she's an attorney.

56:05.083 --> 56:06.834
I'm going to see if she can meet us

56:06.875 --> 56:08.500
at the police station.

56:08.542 --> 56:09.417
That's a really bad idea.

56:09.458 --> 56:10.458
Riley, tell her.

56:10.500 --> 56:12.083
Barb?

56:12.125 --> 56:14.291
Yeah, this is Karen Cartwright.

56:14.333 --> 56:16.291
I need to ask you a favor...

56:16.333 --> 56:17.583
a big one.

56:19.250 --> 56:20.542
This is the situation.

56:21.959 --> 56:23.959
I can't believe you're going to let her do this to us.

56:24.000 --> 56:25.834
Erica, it's over.

56:25.875 --> 56:27.917
Do you really think that we can keep this up anymore?

56:27.959 --> 56:30.166
Well, the cops may be looking for you,

56:30.208 --> 56:32.875
but they don't know about me.

56:32.917 --> 56:34.333
And you'd better not tell them.

56:34.375 --> 56:35.542
What?

56:35.583 --> 56:37.458
Wait! Erica...

57:02.458 --> 57:03.667
You're 10 minutes late.

57:03.709 --> 57:04.917
Sorry, this isn't the easiest place to find

57:04.959 --> 57:06.458
in the dark.

57:06.500 --> 57:08.083
Okay, where's your friend?

57:08.125 --> 57:10.083
She's not coming.

57:10.125 --> 57:11.709
And she's not my friend.

57:11.750 --> 57:12.834
Huh.

57:12.875 --> 57:15.125
Normally, I love a good cat fight,

57:15.166 --> 57:17.750
but things are a little tense for me right now,

57:17.792 --> 57:19.709
so I'm not going to ask you to explain that.

57:19.750 --> 57:21.959
Listen, there's been a bit of a glitch--

57:22.000 --> 57:24.375
You're short.

57:24.417 --> 57:26.959
Like I said, there was a glitch.

57:27.000 --> 57:29.792
Wh-what is that, a glitch?

57:29.834 --> 57:30.583
Where's the rest of it?

57:31.750 --> 57:33.417
That's all I could get.

57:34.667 --> 57:36.750
The Secret Service was waiting for us at the exchange.

57:36.792 --> 57:38.125
Riley almost got caught, they took her money--

57:38.166 --> 57:39.583
What, you brought the feds down on us?

57:41.166 --> 57:44.000
Oh, this just keeps getting better and better...

57:46.750 --> 57:47.625
There's still 40 grand there--

57:47.667 --> 57:48.709
Hey!

57:48.750 --> 57:49.834
Let's just cut our losses.

57:49.875 --> 57:52.458
If I needed 40, I would have said 40.

57:52.500 --> 57:53.792
Did you think the people I owe

57:53.834 --> 57:54.792
can't count?

57:54.834 --> 57:56.375
If I don't get them the full 50

57:56.417 --> 57:57.667
by Saturday night,

57:57.709 --> 58:00.083
they're going to break more than just my legs.

58:00.125 --> 58:01.417
I thought the deadline was today.

58:03.125 --> 58:07.083
I was hoping to get it to them early,

58:07.125 --> 58:08.166
earn some brownie points.

58:08.208 --> 58:09.417
I thought you girls could handle it.

58:09.458 --> 58:10.750
I guess I gave you too much credit.

58:10.792 --> 58:11.750
Then let's just go.

58:12.750 --> 58:14.125
Just get out of town,

58:14.166 --> 58:16.709
take the money and run.

58:16.750 --> 58:19.041
We can be together,

58:19.083 --> 58:20.208
you and me...

58:22.625 --> 58:24.583
Right, you and me,

58:24.625 --> 58:27.417
on the run like outlaws...

58:34.709 --> 58:36.500
You know what...

58:36.542 --> 58:40.875
that actually sounds like a plan.

58:44.291 --> 58:46.375
Screw the school,

58:46.417 --> 58:47.625
screw this place,

58:47.667 --> 58:48.458
screw the town, screw everything.

58:52.625 --> 58:54.709
But first,

58:54.750 --> 58:56.959
you've got to do exactly what I say.

59:09.417 --> 59:10.375
Hey...

59:10.417 --> 59:11.500
Oliver,

59:11.542 --> 59:12.834
I was hoping to see you.

59:12.875 --> 59:14.250
I've been waiting here forever.

59:14.291 --> 59:16.709
Why? What's going on?

59:16.750 --> 59:18.959
Is Riley okay?

59:19.000 --> 59:21.542
Uh, that's what I needed to talk to you about, actually.

59:23.291 --> 59:25.250
We hit a snag.

59:25.291 --> 59:26.166
A snag?

59:27.875 --> 59:29.041
What the hell does that mean?

59:29.083 --> 59:30.083
Where's Riley?

59:54.041 --> 59:55.208
Barb is on her way,

59:55.250 --> 59:57.291
15 minutes.

59:57.333 --> 59:59.792
Great.

59:59.834 --> 01:00:00.917
I'm sure you'd rather

01:00:00.959 --> 01:00:02.375
be anywhere but here right now,

01:00:02.417 --> 01:00:04.208
but you gotta trust me on this,

01:00:04.250 --> 01:00:06.000
this is the smart play.

01:00:07.750 --> 01:00:10.208
Do you remember when...

01:00:10.250 --> 01:00:13.250
Mom was taken away,

01:00:13.291 --> 01:00:16.709
and I had to stay in the house the first time?

01:00:16.750 --> 01:00:19.250
I remember.

01:00:19.291 --> 01:00:21.917
This is...

01:00:21.959 --> 01:00:24.125
a hundred times worse.

01:00:26.250 --> 01:00:28.875
Well, we got through that.

01:00:28.917 --> 01:00:30.875
We'll get through this,

01:00:30.917 --> 01:00:32.291
I promise.

01:01:04.041 --> 01:01:05.625
Oh, my God.

01:01:05.667 --> 01:01:06.834
-What? -That's Oliver's mom.

01:01:09.417 --> 01:01:11.583
Something's wrong.

01:01:15.333 --> 01:01:16.208
Ms. Jackson?

01:01:16.250 --> 01:01:17.291
Riley...

01:01:17.333 --> 01:01:18.792
She's his girlfriend.

01:01:20.208 --> 01:01:21.208
Where's Oliver?

01:01:21.250 --> 01:01:23.041
Who did this to him?

01:01:23.083 --> 01:01:24.500
Did what--

01:01:24.542 --> 01:01:26.083
You must know something.

01:01:26.125 --> 01:01:27.875
No-- What's wrong?

01:01:27.917 --> 01:01:29.041
Where's Oliver?

01:01:29.083 --> 01:01:31.583
Somebody kidnapped my son!

01:01:31.625 --> 01:01:34.917
Ma'am, I need you to calm down, okay?

01:01:34.959 --> 01:01:36.375
We have video surveillance,

01:01:36.417 --> 01:01:37.750
we are analyzing it now.

01:01:37.792 --> 01:01:39.000
We're going to find him,

01:01:39.041 --> 01:01:41.458
I give you my word.

01:01:41.500 --> 01:01:42.583
I'm Detective Glass. You are?

01:01:42.625 --> 01:01:43.875
Karen Cartwright.

01:01:43.917 --> 01:01:46.000
This is my niece, Riley, I'm her legal guardian.

01:01:46.041 --> 01:01:47.333
Your niece was friends with the missing boy?

01:01:47.375 --> 01:01:48.834
They're dating, yes.

01:01:50.125 --> 01:01:51.875
We're going to need to talk to both of you.

01:01:51.917 --> 01:01:52.917
That's all right.

01:01:52.959 --> 01:01:54.041
That's actually, why we're here.

01:02:04.750 --> 01:02:06.208
Riley?

01:02:06.250 --> 01:02:07.583
What?

01:02:07.625 --> 01:02:09.125
Your aunt says you have something to tell us

01:02:09.166 --> 01:02:10.917
that might be relevant to the case.

01:02:13.291 --> 01:02:14.542
No, I'm...

01:02:14.583 --> 01:02:17.250
I don't-I don't- I thought I did, but...

01:02:17.291 --> 01:02:18.750
I don't know anything about this.

01:02:18.792 --> 01:02:20.000
Riley--

01:02:20.041 --> 01:02:21.792
I just, I can't do this right now.

01:02:35.500 --> 01:02:37.583
They have Oliver,

01:02:37.625 --> 01:02:39.125
and it's my fault.

01:02:39.166 --> 01:02:40.333
You don't know that.

01:02:40.375 --> 01:02:42.291
Yes, I do. Look.

01:02:46.166 --> 01:02:48.000
Okay. Okay...

01:02:49.750 --> 01:02:51.375
I know this is difficult,

01:02:51.417 --> 01:02:54.125
but what we have to do now is go back in there,

01:02:54.166 --> 01:02:55.500
and tell them everything that we know--

01:02:55.542 --> 01:02:56.792
No--

01:02:56.834 --> 01:02:58.875
I... I know you don't want to believe this,

01:02:58.917 --> 01:03:00.458
but the longer we wait,

01:03:00.500 --> 01:03:01.542
the harder it's going to be

01:03:01.583 --> 01:03:02.750
to convince them you're not part of this.

01:03:02.792 --> 01:03:05.417
And what if they kill Oliver?

01:03:05.458 --> 01:03:06.750
How can I look at his parents again,

01:03:06.792 --> 01:03:07.917
ever,

01:03:07.959 --> 01:03:09.625
knowing that I could have done something

01:03:09.667 --> 01:03:12.166
to save him?

01:03:12.208 --> 01:03:13.750
Okay, I got him into this

01:03:13.792 --> 01:03:16.291
in the first place.

01:03:16.333 --> 01:03:18.083
Erica's right,

01:03:18.125 --> 01:03:21.875
I always blame other people when things go wrong.

01:03:23.458 --> 01:03:24.834
I did this,

01:03:24.875 --> 01:03:26.792
I have to fix it.

01:03:31.041 --> 01:03:32.208
Get in the car, now.

01:03:47.083 --> 01:03:49.542
"Or he dies."

01:03:50.750 --> 01:03:53.166
I should have said something more...

01:03:53.208 --> 01:03:55.834
I don't know, cool.

01:03:55.875 --> 01:03:58.125
I think she got the message.

01:04:01.417 --> 01:04:03.959
We're not really going to kill him, though...

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:05.000
right?

01:04:05.041 --> 01:04:06.083
Of course not.

01:04:06.125 --> 01:04:07.166
It's just a bluff

01:04:07.208 --> 01:04:09.792
to prevent her from flaking out on us.

01:04:09.834 --> 01:04:11.583
You said he loves her, right?

01:04:11.625 --> 01:04:12.625
Big time.

01:04:12.667 --> 01:04:14.417
Then he's not going to do anything

01:04:14.458 --> 01:04:15.667
to get her in trouble,

01:04:15.709 --> 01:04:18.709
like pointing the finger at her best friend.

01:04:18.750 --> 01:04:20.625
I don't know...

01:04:20.667 --> 01:04:22.375
Counterfeiting is one thing,

01:04:22.417 --> 01:04:23.667
but kidnapping?

01:04:23.709 --> 01:04:25.792
You think I'm happy about this?

01:04:25.834 --> 01:04:27.500
My ass is on the line here,

01:04:27.542 --> 01:04:28.500
I have no choice.

01:04:28.542 --> 01:04:30.125
Our asses..

01:04:30.166 --> 01:04:32.166
We're in this together, remember?

01:04:32.208 --> 01:04:34.166
You're right.

01:04:34.208 --> 01:04:36.917
I'm sorry.

01:04:40.208 --> 01:04:42.375
How far do you and Riley go back?

01:04:42.417 --> 01:04:44.041
Fourth grade?

01:04:44.083 --> 01:04:45.667
Third, actually.

01:04:45.709 --> 01:04:46.625
Wow.

01:04:48.375 --> 01:04:49.875
Well, if it's this easy for you

01:04:49.917 --> 01:04:52.291
to betray someone you've known half your life...

01:04:53.625 --> 01:04:55.667
I wonder how hard it is for you

01:04:55.709 --> 01:04:58.125
to turn on someone you're just getting to know?

01:04:59.542 --> 01:05:01.083
Relax, baby,

01:05:01.125 --> 01:05:02.792
that's not going to happen.

01:05:04.458 --> 01:05:06.250
That's right.

01:05:06.291 --> 01:05:07.667
It's not.

01:05:12.583 --> 01:05:15.417
How well do you know this Tim guy anyway?

01:05:15.458 --> 01:05:18.667
Why does he need 50 grand?

01:05:18.709 --> 01:05:20.166
Erica says that he owes money

01:05:20.208 --> 01:05:22.083
to shady people, I don't...

01:05:22.125 --> 01:05:25.583
And they'll kill him if he doesn't pay up.

01:05:27.375 --> 01:05:30.750
No wonder he's taking hostages.

01:05:32.291 --> 01:05:34.834
Maybe we can figure out where he's holding Oliver

01:05:34.875 --> 01:05:36.709
and go in and get him.

01:05:36.750 --> 01:05:39.041
We're not Delta Force, honey.

01:05:42.083 --> 01:05:44.458
I'd take out a loan, but...

01:05:44.500 --> 01:05:45.792
I'm already over-extended.

01:05:45.834 --> 01:05:49.208
No bank is going to touch me with a 10-foot pole.

01:05:49.250 --> 01:05:51.750
I can't let you go out on a limb for me.

01:05:51.792 --> 01:05:55.291
I'm already out on a limb, Riley.

01:05:55.333 --> 01:05:57.125
We both are.

01:05:57.166 --> 01:05:58.417
The federal government is after you.

01:05:58.458 --> 01:06:02.083
How do you think it's going to end?

01:06:02.125 --> 01:06:03.750
What the hell were you thinking?

01:06:09.959 --> 01:06:12.583
I'm sorry. I'm sorry...

01:06:17.250 --> 01:06:20.583
We need options that don't involve the authorities.

01:06:20.625 --> 01:06:22.709
I'm not gonna let them take you away from me.

01:06:38.041 --> 01:06:39.208
It's time you taught me everything you know

01:06:39.250 --> 01:06:40.667
about printing money.

01:06:40.709 --> 01:06:42.917
You can't be serious.

01:06:42.959 --> 01:06:45.625
You're all I have.

01:06:45.667 --> 01:06:49.125
It's our only choice.

01:06:55.542 --> 01:06:56.875
Well, I wish you'd spent this much time

01:06:56.917 --> 01:06:58.333
on your schoolwork,

01:06:58.375 --> 01:07:01.208
but I gotta to say, I'm impressed.

01:07:01.250 --> 01:07:02.625
You have no idea how weird it is

01:07:02.667 --> 01:07:04.667
to hear you say that.

01:07:04.709 --> 01:07:06.208
Why...

01:07:06.250 --> 01:07:07.291
because I'm your aunt?

01:07:07.333 --> 01:07:08.458
Yeah,

01:07:08.500 --> 01:07:11.166
and now we're business partners.

01:07:11.208 --> 01:07:14.166
Well, we've always been partners.

01:07:14.208 --> 01:07:15.667
You were just too busy being a teenager

01:07:15.709 --> 01:07:17.583
to see it.

01:07:21.583 --> 01:07:24.542
If we get through this,

01:07:24.583 --> 01:07:29.291
I swear I will never slack off in school again.

01:07:29.333 --> 01:07:30.542
I'm going to hold you to that.

01:07:32.041 --> 01:07:33.583
All right...

01:07:33.625 --> 01:07:34.875
show me what you can do.

01:08:35.332 --> 01:08:36.792
Miss Cartwright?

01:08:36.834 --> 01:08:38.709
I was hoping to have that chat with you and your niece

01:08:38.750 --> 01:08:40.542
about Oliver Jackson.

01:08:42.041 --> 01:08:43.207
Um... okay.

01:08:43.250 --> 01:08:44.500
Come on in.

01:08:45.625 --> 01:08:47.250
Late night?

01:08:47.291 --> 01:08:48.667
Yeah.

01:08:48.709 --> 01:08:49.709
I guess it was.

01:08:51.125 --> 01:08:52.959
You know, this has just been hard on both of us.

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:54.250
Mm-hmm.

01:08:54.291 --> 01:08:55.500
I'll just go see if she's awake?

01:08:55.542 --> 01:08:56.875
I'd appreciate that.

01:09:18.625 --> 01:09:20.250
That's the cop from yesterday.

01:09:20.291 --> 01:09:22.082
It's okay, I don't think she knows anything.

01:09:22.125 --> 01:09:23.709
She just wants to ask us some questions.

01:09:23.750 --> 01:09:25.667
Now? You know he wants the money today, right?

01:09:25.709 --> 01:09:27.000
I'm aware of that.

01:09:27.041 --> 01:09:28.500
Now, go put some clothes on.

01:09:28.542 --> 01:09:29.625
Hurry up, go.

01:09:39.500 --> 01:09:40.917
And that was the last time

01:09:40.959 --> 01:09:42.332
you had any contact with him?

01:09:42.375 --> 01:09:43.500
Are you sure?

01:09:43.542 --> 01:09:44.500
Yeah.

01:09:44.542 --> 01:09:45.750
Okay.

01:09:45.792 --> 01:09:47.792
Do you have any leads?

01:09:47.834 --> 01:09:50.082
We have security camera footage

01:09:50.125 --> 01:09:51.207
that suggests

01:09:51.250 --> 01:09:52.250
there were at least two perpetrators,

01:09:52.291 --> 01:09:54.000
one probably female. We think they were known

01:09:54.041 --> 01:09:55.750
to the victim.

01:09:58.458 --> 01:10:00.542
Will this take much longer?

01:10:00.583 --> 01:10:02.000
She and Oliver were...

01:10:02.041 --> 01:10:03.750
are very close.

01:10:03.792 --> 01:10:05.709
There's just one more thing.

01:10:05.750 --> 01:10:07.166
Um...

01:10:07.208 --> 01:10:08.875
We're investigating a counterfeiting ring

01:10:08.917 --> 01:10:10.208
in the area.

01:10:10.250 --> 01:10:13.083
It might be connected to several teenagers.

01:10:13.125 --> 01:10:16.625
Do you know anything about that?

01:10:16.667 --> 01:10:18.917
Honey?

01:10:18.959 --> 01:10:21.458
Counterfeiting? Um...

01:10:21.500 --> 01:10:23.125
No.

01:10:23.166 --> 01:10:24.500
Nothing at all?

01:10:24.542 --> 01:10:27.375
Not even rumors around the schoolyard?

01:10:27.417 --> 01:10:29.417
Um...

01:10:29.458 --> 01:10:30.750
Not that I've heard of.

01:10:36.250 --> 01:10:39.709
Well, thank you both for your cooperation.

01:10:39.750 --> 01:10:42.959
I know this is a stressful time for you.

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:44.208
I'll be in touch.

01:10:50.333 --> 01:10:51.083
She knows.

01:10:51.125 --> 01:10:52.792
I can see it in her face!

01:10:52.834 --> 01:10:53.834
Calm down.

01:10:53.875 --> 01:10:55.959
If she is suspicious,

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:57.250
the best thing that we can do

01:10:57.291 --> 01:10:58.625
is just convince her that everything is normal.

01:10:58.667 --> 01:11:00.458
That means you go to school,

01:11:00.500 --> 01:11:02.291
I go to work,

01:11:02.333 --> 01:11:04.417
just like any normal day.

01:11:04.458 --> 01:11:05.542
Okay?

01:11:07.583 --> 01:11:08.500
Okay.

01:11:11.834 --> 01:11:12.792
See ya.

01:11:47.041 --> 01:11:50.291
This is Detective Glass.

01:11:50.333 --> 01:11:52.500
Well, I need you to put him on.

01:13:03.125 --> 01:13:04.542
Oh, that's Riley.

01:13:07.750 --> 01:13:08.792
There she is.

01:13:08.834 --> 01:13:10.125
Thanks.

01:13:11.667 --> 01:13:13.000
Stop! Federal agents!

01:13:16.542 --> 01:13:17.583
Hey!

01:13:17.625 --> 01:13:18.875
Hey, you!

01:13:57.959 --> 01:13:59.375
Stop!

01:14:08.500 --> 01:14:10.125
This is Peterson.

01:14:10.166 --> 01:14:11.959
We've got an I.D. on the kids.

01:14:13.417 --> 01:14:15.375
I'll just get that for you right away.

01:14:42.500 --> 01:14:44.125
Ma'am?

01:14:44.166 --> 01:14:45.291
Thank you.

01:14:45.333 --> 01:14:47.208
Have a nice day.

01:15:53.625 --> 01:15:54.750
What happened?

01:15:54.792 --> 01:15:55.750
They saw me at the school.

01:15:55.792 --> 01:15:57.333
They know who I am.

01:15:57.375 --> 01:15:58.583
They were all over the exchange, too.

01:15:58.625 --> 01:16:00.125
I could only get Euros.

01:16:00.166 --> 01:16:01.166
What are we gonna do?

01:16:01.208 --> 01:16:02.458
I'm gonna take this money,

01:16:02.500 --> 01:16:04.291
and I'm gonna use it to try to get Oliver back,

01:16:04.333 --> 01:16:05.750
and then you're gonna go to the police,

01:16:05.792 --> 01:16:06.625
and you're gonna surrender--

01:16:06.667 --> 01:16:07.709
What? No!

01:16:07.750 --> 01:16:09.250
--and tell them that it was all my idea,

01:16:09.291 --> 01:16:10.166
the money laundering, the counterfeiting,

01:16:10.208 --> 01:16:11.166
everything. Aunt Karen--

01:16:12.208 --> 01:16:13.500
You have to do that, Riley, okay?

01:16:13.542 --> 01:16:15.709
It's the only way that any of us get out of this.

01:16:19.333 --> 01:16:21.291
It's going to be okay?

01:16:21.333 --> 01:16:22.542
What are you doing?

01:16:22.583 --> 01:16:24.208
You can't you take the fall for my mistakes.

01:16:24.250 --> 01:16:25.959
Riley, no! No!

01:16:33.667 --> 01:16:35.166
Federal agents!

01:16:35.208 --> 01:16:37.000
Hands on your head, do it now!

01:16:38.166 --> 01:16:39.834
On the ground! Do it!

01:16:58.250 --> 01:17:00.417
Our friends on the Secret Service

01:17:00.458 --> 01:17:02.125
wanted to handle this interrogation.

01:17:03.625 --> 01:17:05.333
I told them a missing boy takes precedence

01:17:05.375 --> 01:17:08.458
over a fraud investigation.

01:17:08.500 --> 01:17:11.792
Lucky for you, I won that fight.

01:17:11.834 --> 01:17:14.166
Well, like I told the other officer,

01:17:14.208 --> 01:17:16.333
the kidnapper's name is Tim Sylvester,

01:17:16.375 --> 01:17:18.000
and he's the art teacher at Riley's school.

01:17:18.041 --> 01:17:19.083
We're checking him out now.

01:17:19.125 --> 01:17:21.250
Why don't you tell me a bit more

01:17:21.291 --> 01:17:22.291
about your relationship with him.

01:17:23.333 --> 01:17:24.875
We were partners.

01:17:24.917 --> 01:17:26.166
In a counterfeiting ring?

01:17:26.208 --> 01:17:27.458
Yeah.

01:17:27.500 --> 01:17:28.792
We had a falling out over money.

01:17:33.458 --> 01:17:35.250
I've been drowning in debt

01:17:35.291 --> 01:17:36.917
for the last six months

01:17:36.959 --> 01:17:38.333
ever since my husband died, okay?

01:17:38.375 --> 01:17:40.250
You can check with my credit card company,

01:17:40.291 --> 01:17:41.375
my bank,

01:17:41.417 --> 01:17:42.333
they'll tell you.

01:17:42.375 --> 01:17:43.917
And Riley?

01:17:43.959 --> 01:17:47.083
You said you were her legal guardian?

01:17:47.125 --> 01:17:50.041
Riley has never known her dad,

01:17:50.083 --> 01:17:53.458
and my older sister was an unfit parent.

01:17:53.500 --> 01:17:55.166
Drugs, petty crime...

01:17:55.208 --> 01:17:58.667
so I took Riley in when she was 12.

01:17:58.709 --> 01:18:00.834
And then I let her down.

01:18:00.875 --> 01:18:02.667
Ms. Cartwright...

01:18:02.709 --> 01:18:04.250
Karen...

01:18:04.291 --> 01:18:06.291
She may not be your daughter,

01:18:06.333 --> 01:18:07.959
but she might as well be.

01:18:09.250 --> 01:18:10.333
When you're a parent,

01:18:10.375 --> 01:18:11.667
you'll do anything to protect your child,

01:18:11.709 --> 01:18:14.333
I understand that.

01:18:14.375 --> 01:18:15.750
But why should I believe

01:18:15.792 --> 01:18:18.959
that what you're telling me is the truth?

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:22.166
You don't have to believe me.

01:18:22.208 --> 01:18:25.333
Just find her.

01:18:25.375 --> 01:18:27.458
Find them both!

01:19:34.834 --> 01:19:36.083
Will you relax, please?

01:19:36.125 --> 01:19:38.458
I told you, you're going to be out of here soon.

01:19:38.500 --> 01:19:40.166
No, Erica, you have to listen!

01:19:40.208 --> 01:19:41.667
He-he's going to kill me.

01:19:41.709 --> 01:19:43.542
No, he's not, okay?

01:19:43.583 --> 01:19:45.875
Once she gets us the cash, we're leaving.

01:19:45.917 --> 01:19:47.875
And if you stab us in the back,

01:19:47.917 --> 01:19:49.500
Riley goes down, too.

01:19:49.542 --> 01:19:51.375
Is that what you want?

01:19:51.417 --> 01:19:52.375
No.

01:19:55.291 --> 01:19:56.458
No--

01:19:56.500 --> 01:19:57.542
Shh!

01:20:00.500 --> 01:20:03.500
She should be here any minute.

01:20:03.542 --> 01:20:05.125
You looking for me?

01:20:05.166 --> 01:20:06.583
Yeah. Money?

01:20:09.458 --> 01:20:11.709
Yeah.

01:20:11.750 --> 01:20:13.250
Throw it over.

01:20:22.083 --> 01:20:24.417
These are Euros.

01:20:26.041 --> 01:20:27.333
They all are.

01:20:27.375 --> 01:20:29.000
Yeah.

01:20:29.041 --> 01:20:31.792
The police were on me at the exchange, okay?

01:20:31.834 --> 01:20:33.083
I'm lucky I got away with anything.

01:20:33.125 --> 01:20:35.166
That wasn't the deal.

01:20:37.583 --> 01:20:40.333
We were best friends.

01:20:40.375 --> 01:20:42.875
You're gonna go with this jerkoff

01:20:42.917 --> 01:20:44.208
and screw me?

01:20:44.250 --> 01:20:45.709
What the hell, Erica?

01:20:48.583 --> 01:20:49.375
Let's go, now.

01:20:49.417 --> 01:20:51.375
No, no, not yet.

01:20:51.417 --> 01:20:52.875
Not yet?

01:20:52.917 --> 01:20:54.750
Let's just go before the cops find us here.

01:20:54.792 --> 01:20:56.083
You still don't get it, do you?

01:20:57.125 --> 01:20:59.959
No, I want the police to find you.

01:21:01.417 --> 01:21:04.000
That's kind of the whole point.

01:21:04.041 --> 01:21:06.792
What?

01:21:11.709 --> 01:21:13.375
Tim, what are you doing?

01:21:17.291 --> 01:21:19.625
It's really sad when friendships get torn apart

01:21:19.667 --> 01:21:21.500
over a man.

01:21:21.542 --> 01:21:24.417
And when there's a lot of money's involved...

01:21:24.458 --> 01:21:25.875
things can get really messy.

01:21:41.625 --> 01:21:42.500
Riley!

01:21:46.709 --> 01:21:47.834
Riley!

01:21:48.917 --> 01:21:50.166
Erica, run!

01:22:08.417 --> 01:22:10.125
Riley...

01:22:10.166 --> 01:22:14.000
you were my favorite student.

01:22:21.959 --> 01:22:25.667
So much wasted talent.

01:22:41.667 --> 01:22:42.583
Gotcha.

01:22:45.542 --> 01:22:46.834
Please.

01:22:49.875 --> 01:22:52.083
I am really sorry, Riley.

01:23:09.667 --> 01:23:11.250
Thanks.

01:23:11.291 --> 01:23:15.041
He was gonna kill me.

01:23:15.083 --> 01:23:15.959
That son of a bitch.

01:23:23.500 --> 01:23:24.750
Let's go.

01:23:42.750 --> 01:23:44.291
Hi!

01:23:44.333 --> 01:23:45.417
How can I help you?

01:23:45.458 --> 01:23:47.375
I'd like to make a donation

01:23:47.417 --> 01:23:49.166
to the Stephanie Summers Memorial Fund.

01:23:49.208 --> 01:23:50.250
Absolutely.

01:23:50.291 --> 01:23:52.000
Will that be cash or check?

01:23:52.041 --> 01:23:53.500
Cash.

01:24:04.041 --> 01:24:05.333
Do you also take Euros?

01:24:20.291 --> 01:24:24.583
Okay, and now you can just apply the filter.

01:24:24.625 --> 01:24:26.792
Great.

01:24:26.834 --> 01:24:28.542
With just a little practice,

01:24:28.583 --> 01:24:31.083
and you'll be a pro in no time.

01:24:32.625 --> 01:24:35.041
Looking good, Cole.

01:24:35.083 --> 01:24:36.583
Susie...

01:24:36.625 --> 01:24:40.041
educational games only, or I'll get in trouble.

01:24:40.083 --> 01:24:41.250
Hey.

01:24:41.291 --> 01:24:43.208
Hi.

01:24:43.250 --> 01:24:44.875
So...

01:24:44.917 --> 01:24:47.959
how is community service going today?

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:49.375
Great.

01:24:49.417 --> 01:24:50.500
Two more years of this,

01:24:50.542 --> 01:24:52.542
and I'll have paid my debt to society.

01:24:52.583 --> 01:24:54.250
Could have been a lot worse.

01:24:54.291 --> 01:24:55.417
Yeah.

01:24:57.291 --> 01:24:59.583
If it wasn't for you and my aunt, definitely.

01:25:00.709 --> 01:25:02.917
You saved my life.

01:25:02.959 --> 01:25:05.667
Being a character witness is the least I could do.

01:25:05.709 --> 01:25:08.041
By the way, you ready to go see your aunt?

01:25:08.083 --> 01:25:11.667
Oh, you don't have to come, really.

01:25:11.709 --> 01:25:13.166
I said I'd drive you,

01:25:13.208 --> 01:25:14.709
I'll drive you.

01:25:14.750 --> 01:25:16.458
Thanks.

01:25:16.500 --> 01:25:18.625
Taking the bus to the federal penitentiary

01:25:18.667 --> 01:25:20.834
is very depressing.

01:25:21.750 --> 01:25:22.917
By the way,

01:25:22.959 --> 01:25:24.417
have you figured out what you're going to do

01:25:24.458 --> 01:25:25.875
when she's out?

01:25:25.917 --> 01:25:27.291
Yeah,

01:25:27.333 --> 01:25:28.792
I'm going to spend the rest of my life

01:25:28.834 --> 01:25:30.083
paying her back.

01:25:33.500 --> 01:25:35.583
Like most crime sprees,

01:25:35.625 --> 01:25:36.917
<i>ours came crashing down</i> <i>around us.</i>

01:25:36.959 --> 01:25:40.458
<i>We could have died...</i>

01:25:40.500 --> 01:25:42.583
<i>Instead, I walked away</i> <i>with a felony conviction</i>

01:25:42.625 --> 01:25:45.875
<i>and a life lesson--</i>

01:25:45.917 --> 01:25:48.500
<i>Crime doesn't pay,</i> <i>even with counterfeit money.</i>
