Hurry up, <i>Leprechaun Hunter</i> is starting!
Turn on the TV.

00:07.583 --> 00:09.834
-Which one turns on the TV?
-It's this one.

Hi, Frankie.

00:16.125 --> 00:19.000
-Bye-bye.
-[whirring]

00:19.083 --> 00:22.000
-I think it's this one.
-[popping]

00:22.500 --> 00:24.583
That activates the confetti.

-This one doesn't do anything.

-[thuds]
-[electricity crackles]

00:28.041 --> 00:29.959
-Oh.
-I'm guessing that turns off the lights.

00:30.041 --> 00:31.917
Turn 'em back on!
Turn 'em back on!

00:32.000 --> 00:34.792
This one only turns off the lights.
Find the one that turns them back on.

00:34.875 --> 00:38.041
-OK.
-[brothers scream]

00:41.417 --> 00:43.834
So, funny thing,
I'm making a smoothie

00:43.917 --> 00:45.917
and suddenly the blender
comes on by itself.

00:46.000 --> 00:49.000
So, that's what this was for.

00:50.125 --> 00:51.500

Oh, thanks.
It's really good to see you, too.

02:20.083 --> 02:22.250
-Excuse me.
-I'm sorry.

02:22.333 --> 02:23.458
I just thought you were the Shoe.

02:23.542 --> 02:26.625
You don't mean Carl Schuster
from elementary school?

02:26.709 --> 02:28.291
Yeah, he's here for a visit.

02:28.375 --> 02:29.875
I hope he does that thing
where he pretends to be

02:29.959 --> 02:32.250
a clumsy robot
who can't stop bumping into me.

02:32.333 --> 02:34.709
The clumsy robot?
I loved it when he did that.

[mimicking whirring]

02:36.667 --> 02:38.959
-Excuse me. I'm sorry.

-Pardon me.
-Stop it.

02:40.834 --> 02:42.792
I don't do it as good as him.

02:42.875 --> 02:45.709
I will never forget
the last time I saw the Shoe.

02:48.583 --> 02:50.333
Actually, I don't remember
the last time I saw the Shoe.

02:50.417 --> 02:52.375
-He was more Joe's friend.
-Yeah.

02:52.458 --> 02:54.667
Well, I clearly remember
the time in third grade

02:54.750 --> 02:58.291
when the Shoe filled my
Penelope Peach-pit purse with pudding.

02:58.375 --> 03:00.417
-[laughs]
-You think that's funny?

03:00.500 --> 03:01.959
No, ma'am.

03:02.041 --> 03:06.667
Stella, usually when a boy
is mean to a girl, he's crushing on her.

03:06.750 --> 03:09.000
-Are you defending him?
-No, ma'am.

For the next couple of days,
I'm gonna be

the fourth Jonas band member, all right?

03:26.000 --> 03:27.583
Stella Malone.

03:27.667 --> 03:29.417
My, how you have grown.

03:29.500 --> 03:32.250
You put plum pudding in
my Penelope Peach-pit purse!

03:34.041 --> 03:36.500
Did she spit on anyone else besides me?

03:36.583 --> 03:39.959
Cool place.
Mind if I look around?

03:40.041 --> 03:42.792
-Go ahead.
-[mimicking robot] Excuse me. Pardon me.

03:42.875 --> 03:46.083
-I'm a robot. I'm very clumsy.
-The clumsy robot!

03:46.166 --> 03:48.583
Yes! That's so funny.

03:51.792 --> 03:53.959
[chuckles]
Or that time at summer camp

03:54.041 --> 03:56.458
when that rabbit got into our tent
and Kevin went off screaming.

03:56.542 --> 03:58.709
-[laughing]
-The shadow made it look like a bear.

03:58.792 --> 04:02.291
-With big floppy ears?
-That's what made it more scary.

04:02.375 --> 04:04.667
[laughs]
Those were such great times,

04:04.750 --> 04:06.750
but I didn't come here
to talk about 'em.

04:06.834 --> 04:10.083
I want to hear all about
your crazy rock star lives.

04:10.166 --> 04:13.291
Hey, do I hear
Carl "the Shoe" Schuster?

04:13.375 --> 04:16.667
-Rock star dad!
-Last time I saw you, you were wearing

04:16.750 --> 04:19.500
your alien ninja costume.
I didn't think you ever took that off!

04:19.583 --> 04:22.000
-Got it on under the shirt, sir.
-Wear it proudly.

04:22.083 --> 04:23.959
You know, Joe still wears
his dinosaur underwear.

04:24.041 --> 04:28.000
That was one time...
including today.

04:28.458 --> 04:31.542
Well, look, <i>me</i> fire <i>casa es su</i> fire <i>casa.</i>

04:31.625 --> 04:34.291

<i>-Fuego,</i> sir.

04:34.375 --> 04:35.667
You're welcome, Carl.

04:37.166 --> 04:41.083
Hey, remember that time we practiced
signing autographs using cheese spray?

04:41.709 --> 04:44.083
-When was that?
-Right now!

04:44.166 --> 04:48.625
-Whoo! Yeah!
-Dude! Dude, you're cheesing our wall!

04:58.291 --> 05:00.083
Look what I got!
[laughs]

05:00.166 --> 05:02.458
A potato chip!

05:02.542 --> 05:05.333
A potato chip that just happens
to look like Joe.

05:05.458 --> 05:06.834
OK, what?
There's no way that a...

05:06.917 --> 05:08.917
[gasps]
Whoa.

05:09.000 --> 05:10.709
That really does look like Joe.

05:10.792 --> 05:12.625
I mean, it has the part in his hair and...

05:12.709 --> 05:15.291
It even has that cute little dimple
that he has under his nose.

05:15.375 --> 05:17.792
I call it a Joe-tato chip.

05:17.875 --> 05:19.583
It was worth every penny.

05:19.667 --> 05:25.125
Wait. That $50 you borrowed from me
was spent on a Joe-tato chip?

05:25.208 --> 05:28.083
-Awesome, right?
-Awesome wrong. I wouldn't have

05:28.166 --> 05:30.625
lent you the money if I knew
that's what you were gonna spend it on.

05:30.709 --> 05:34.458
Wow, I never realized your friendship
came with so many conditions attached.

05:35.166 --> 05:36.583
Come on, Joe.

05:37.583 --> 05:39.166
[no dialogue]

05:39.250 --> 05:41.291
I'm sorry about the cheese spray.

05:41.375 --> 05:44.583
I thought you guys had, like,
roadies or butlers to clean up for you.

05:44.667 --> 05:47.750
Huh. No.
We spray it, we clean it.

05:47.834 --> 05:50.125
That's why I like to keep
the cheese on the crackers.

05:50.208 --> 05:52.625
So, what are we gonna do tonight?

05:52.709 --> 05:54.625

-Crack the books.

05:56.667 --> 05:58.125
-Oh, yeah.
-School night, remember?

05:58.208 --> 06:00.667
I don't see why you guys
even go to school.

06:00.750 --> 06:02.583
I mean, you're rock stars.

06:02.667 --> 06:05.083
Hey, Joe.
How's that history paper coming along?

06:05.166 --> 06:07.166
[sighs]
Almost done, Mr. Costello.

06:07.250 --> 06:09.166
I just need to finish writing the end...

06:09.667 --> 06:11.750
then I need to finish the middle.

06:12.000 --> 06:13.583
And then I've got to finish the beginning.

06:13.667 --> 06:14.500
Oh!

06:14.583 --> 06:16.625
You know, if this music thing
doesn't work out,

06:16.709 --> 06:18.083
you might have a career in comedy.

06:18.166 --> 06:21.417
Whoa! You know who
you're talking to, slick?

06:21.500 --> 06:26.750
Hello? Joe doesn't need to write
some paper about history.

06:26.834 --> 06:28.583
He makes history.

06:29.041 --> 06:31.709
I do not believe
I've met your friend, Joe.

06:31.792 --> 06:33.792
And you never will.

06:34.208 --> 06:35.625
Not cool, dude.

06:35.709 --> 06:37.834
That's my history teacher.
What are you doing?

06:37.917 --> 06:40.250
I'm sorry.
I'm... I'm just excited.

-OK.

-Yeah! Oh!

Ooh, look out!
Behind the back. Oh!

Put it down, Carl.
Oh, don't lick it!

[Joe] Carl, you don't even know
where that's been.

07:25.750 --> 07:27.625
Hey, there's a smudge on this.

07:27.709 --> 07:30.250
-[screams] No!
-Something wrong?

07:31.333 --> 07:35.709
That smudge is an autograph from legendary
blues guitarist Lefty Bojangles.

Dude, I'm... I'm way sorry.

07:37.917 --> 07:40.375
I mean, I didn't know.
That guy's got really bad handwriting.

07:40.458 --> 07:43.000
That's because he has two left hands!

07:43.083 --> 07:45.583
Hey, Carl, you're gonna love this.

07:45.875 --> 07:49.291
-This is the Stellavator.
-OK.

07:49.375 --> 07:52.208
Stella designed it to hold our clothes.
She's our stylist now.

-Ooh.
-We like to call her our Stella-list.

07:55.709 --> 07:58.083
-Oh.
-Only Kevin likes to call her that.

pull that outfit off,

I do not think Stella's
going to be happy.

08:39.291 --> 08:41.750

What are we gonna do?
Carl has gone rock 'n' roll crazy.

08:50.250 --> 08:53.417
He's even more annoying than I remember,
and I didn't think that was possible.

08:53.500 --> 08:55.250
Guys, he's just excited to be here.

08:55.333 --> 08:57.917
He'll mellow out and start acting like
the Carl we know and love.

That we know you love.

09:00.792 --> 09:02.792

-Or not.
-[electricity crackles]

I'm here to apologize.

Oh. Then...

-Macy!

It's like he's not even my friend anymore.

11:07.667 --> 11:09.083

he's going home tomorrow.

It's quiet.

11:15.041 --> 11:16.709
Too quiet.

11:16.834 --> 11:19.625
He said he was making
a phone call to home,

11:19.667 --> 11:22.625

Maybe he's homesick.

11:23.959 --> 11:25.500

You know how I was supposed
to leave tomorrow?

I can stay for a whole week!

By the way, I met some guys outside.
Come on in, guys.

They gave me like 20 bucks

I was thinking,
any girl that is the proud owner

15:01.458 --> 15:05.917
of a rhinestone-encrusted pencil case
should not be criticizing anyone.

15:06.750 --> 15:09.000
Yeah, I was there when you bought it.
I thought it was weird at the time,

-Right... because you're my best friend.

as Jonas in a snack dip.
