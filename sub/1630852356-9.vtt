WEBVTT

00:00.627 --> 00:02.296
[Andromeda]
So, in conclusion,

00:02.297 --> 00:04.836
the moon is actually
a giant psychic brain

00:04.837 --> 00:06.706
that controls the stock market,

00:06.707 --> 00:09.416
and that is why I don't
drink out of cups!

00:09.417 --> 00:11.086
[slurping]

00:11.087 --> 00:13.086
Wow. I'll never drink
out of cups again.

00:13.087 --> 00:16.466
Hey! Whhhyyyy?

00:16.467 --> 00:18.706
Sorry, Cricket,
it's the moon's fault.

00:18.707 --> 00:20.876
[grunts] Gloria,
can you help me clean this up?

00:20.877 --> 00:23.586
Sorry, Cricket,
but I've got places to be.

00:23.587 --> 00:24.916
What do you think?

00:24.917 --> 00:26.466
You look like a dazzling flower

00:26.467 --> 00:28.466
grown from a bed
of rainbows and starlight.

00:28.467 --> 00:30.126
Also, your shoes are cute!

00:30.127 --> 00:32.086
So, what's the occasion?

00:32.087 --> 00:34.086
I'm going to that hot
new nightclub downtown.

00:34.087 --> 00:36.086
There's gonna be music, dancing,

00:36.087 --> 00:37.876
- no Cricket...
- [Cricket grumbles]

00:37.877 --> 00:38.916
...and the best part is,

00:38.917 --> 00:40.876
all my new friends
are gonna be there.

00:40.877 --> 00:43.046
It's gonna be the best
girls' night ever.

00:43.047 --> 00:45.086
Oh, and, Cricket,
be sure to close up tonight.

00:45.087 --> 00:46.416
Oh, what?

00:46.417 --> 00:47.916
Later!

00:47.917 --> 00:49.876
[Cricket spits, grumbles]

00:49.877 --> 00:51.876
A nightclub!
Sounds fun.

00:51.877 --> 00:53.336
What should we wear?

00:53.337 --> 00:54.916
Us? We're not going.

00:54.917 --> 00:57.876
Of course we are.
Didn't you hear
what Gloria said?

00:57.877 --> 00:59.466
What?
[gasps]

00:59.467 --> 01:01.126
All my new friends
will be there...

01:01.127 --> 01:02.966
...friends will be there...

01:02.967 --> 01:04.507
...friends.

01:06.377 --> 01:09.046
[sharp gasp]
She meant us!

01:09.047 --> 01:11.086
Of course!
That wink was so clear!

01:11.087 --> 01:12.876
If we don't go
to that nightclub,

01:12.877 --> 01:14.126
she will be crushed.

01:14.127 --> 01:16.506
Well, all right,
let's go clubbing!

01:16.507 --> 01:17.966
Yeah!

01:17.967 --> 01:19.966
Do you know what a nightclub is?

01:19.967 --> 01:21.297
Not a clue.

01:22.377 --> 01:27.086
[Cricket grumbles and moans]

01:27.087 --> 01:28.206
[Bill grunts]

01:28.207 --> 01:30.206
[Cricket moans]

01:30.207 --> 01:32.546
- Uh, rough day?
- The worst!

01:32.547 --> 01:35.416
[groans] You're so lucky
you don't have a job.

01:35.417 --> 01:36.916
I... have a job.

01:36.917 --> 01:38.416
I can't even talk about it!

01:38.417 --> 01:40.916
I just want to relax
and watch a movie!

01:40.917 --> 01:42.837
[gasps]
A movie!

01:45.547 --> 01:46.916
Oh, thank you.

01:46.917 --> 01:48.546
So, what are we watchin'?

01:48.547 --> 01:51.006
My all-time favorite movie.
It's a classic--

01:51.007 --> 01:53.837
Constellation Battles!

01:57.877 --> 01:59.966
Wow! Cool!

01:59.967 --> 02:01.416
Ha! You think that's cool?

02:01.417 --> 02:03.836
Just wait
till the spaceship explodes.

02:03.837 --> 02:05.086
It comes out of nowhere.

02:05.087 --> 02:07.506
Ohh! Ohh! That was it!
Were you surprised?

02:07.507 --> 02:10.166
No. You just told me
it was gonna happen.

02:10.167 --> 02:12.086
Oh, right. Just got
a little excited.

02:12.087 --> 02:13.586
It won't happen again.

02:13.587 --> 02:14.796
Hmm.

02:14.797 --> 02:16.377
[dance music playing]

02:22.007 --> 02:22.917
Wow.

02:22.918 --> 02:24.416
[Tilly]
This place is lovely,

02:24.417 --> 02:26.206
and look at all these people!

02:26.207 --> 02:28.006
Too bad most of them
are vampires.

02:28.007 --> 02:30.046
Luckily, I brought garlic water.

02:30.047 --> 02:31.666
[gasps]
There she is.

02:31.667 --> 02:33.796
[laughing]
Oh, my gosh,
Keightlynne,

02:33.797 --> 02:35.796
Kaity-Lynn,
and Caitlin with a "C."

02:35.797 --> 02:37.586
You're so funny!

02:37.587 --> 02:39.416
Selfie with my girls!

02:39.417 --> 02:42.416
- [camera clicks]
- Oh, my gosh, guys,
that was so...

02:42.417 --> 02:43.586
...cute?

02:43.587 --> 02:45.506
The party has arrived.

02:45.507 --> 02:47.796
Gloria, do you know them?

02:47.797 --> 02:49.836
No, I've never seen them
in my life.

02:49.837 --> 02:52.416
Do you children need help
finding your parents?

02:52.417 --> 02:54.046
- [Tilly stammers]
- No? Okay.

02:54.047 --> 02:56.047
Well, just go, then.

02:57.087 --> 02:58.796
Well, that was weird.

02:58.797 --> 03:00.876
Gloria didn't seem
to remember who we were.

03:00.877 --> 03:04.336
Mmm. I've seen this before,
and it's no good.

03:04.337 --> 03:07.086
Gloria's got... amnesia.

03:07.087 --> 03:08.966
Wha-wha-whhhaaaa--?

03:08.967 --> 03:10.336
[blasters firing]

03:10.337 --> 03:12.336
Fly, Dante, fly!

03:12.337 --> 03:14.336
Wha--! Look out!
Oh, dang, that was close!

03:14.337 --> 03:16.336
Whew! Good thing they've got
that old guy to guide 'em.

03:16.337 --> 03:17.876
He's my favorite character.

03:17.877 --> 03:19.296
Well, don't get too attached.

03:19.297 --> 03:20.916
He does not make it to the end.

03:20.917 --> 03:23.666
[angry grumble]
Father, can we refrain

03:23.667 --> 03:25.586
from talking
for the rest of the movie

03:25.587 --> 03:27.876
to avoid any surprises.

03:27.877 --> 03:31.546
Oh, no problem!
Old Daddy-O will keep
his lips sealed.

03:31.547 --> 03:33.506
- Mmm?
- Thank you.

03:33.507 --> 03:36.966
These galaxy crystals
possess immense power.

03:36.967 --> 03:39.706
Do not let them fall
into the wrong hands.

03:39.707 --> 03:43.166
And, Dante,
there is one more thing
I must tell you.

03:43.167 --> 03:45.256
[Dante] What is it, old man?

03:45.257 --> 03:47.416
Okay, but when you
stare at me like that,
I know something's gonna happ--

03:47.417 --> 03:49.206
Starra, you're my sister?!

03:49.207 --> 03:50.836
[gasps]
What?

03:50.837 --> 03:52.706
[frustrated grunt]

03:52.707 --> 03:54.256
So then my boss
was like, "Yuh-huh,"

03:54.257 --> 03:56.876
and I was like, "Nuh-uh!"

03:56.877 --> 03:58.006
[laughter]

03:58.007 --> 03:59.206
[loud laughter]

03:59.207 --> 04:00.916
Girl, you need some water.

04:00.917 --> 04:03.166
Andromeda,
I think you're right--

04:03.167 --> 04:05.966
our dear, sweet Gloria
has lost her memory.

04:05.967 --> 04:07.756
I hate being right.

04:07.757 --> 04:09.756
I'm just cursed
with so much knowledge!

04:09.757 --> 04:11.166
What are we gonna do?

04:11.167 --> 04:13.206
Well, we all know
that one gets amnesia

04:13.207 --> 04:15.006
by getting bonked on the head.

04:15.007 --> 04:16.466
So, it only stands to reason

04:16.467 --> 04:18.966
that a secondary bonk
of equal force

04:18.967 --> 04:20.966
will cancel out the initial bonk

04:20.967 --> 04:22.796
and regain her memory.

04:22.797 --> 04:25.006
Oh, so we've
just got to hit her
on the head real hard.

04:25.007 --> 04:26.127
Precisely.

04:27.417 --> 04:30.707
[dance music playing]

04:34.837 --> 04:36.336
Whoa!

04:36.337 --> 04:38.206
[frustrated cry]

04:38.207 --> 04:39.966
Hmm.

04:39.967 --> 04:43.756
- Whoa! Whoa!
- Ohh!

04:43.757 --> 04:45.006
Hey!

04:45.007 --> 04:46.967
[laughter]

04:50.917 --> 04:52.666
[both gasp, then scream]

04:52.667 --> 04:53.667
[Gloria laughing]

04:53.668 --> 04:55.006
[screaming]

04:55.007 --> 04:55.917
[Andromeda]
Whoa!

04:55.918 --> 04:58.046
- [glass shatters]
- What the--?

04:58.047 --> 04:59.337
Huh?

05:00.967 --> 05:02.966
You've only delayed
the inevitable.

05:02.967 --> 05:05.256
Once I find the last
galaxy crystal,

05:05.257 --> 05:07.256
the universe will be mine!

05:07.257 --> 05:09.256
[Bill and Dark Star]
Then all shall tremble

05:09.257 --> 05:12.006
before the might of Dark Star!

05:12.007 --> 05:14.046
[Bill] Huh? Oh, one of
the best scenes is coming up.

05:14.047 --> 05:15.876
Oh, you're gonna love this!

05:15.877 --> 05:17.126
[laughs]
I'm sure I will,

05:17.127 --> 05:19.126
but I bet I'd enjoy it even more

05:19.127 --> 05:21.296
if I had some popcorn.

05:21.297 --> 05:23.876
Ooh, great idea, son.
Be back in a sec.

05:23.877 --> 05:25.256
Heh heh. Finally!

05:25.257 --> 05:27.506
[Bill] Come on,
kernels, pop faster.

05:27.507 --> 05:29.666
I'm gonna miss the part
where Dante finds out
he's secretly a crystal.

05:29.667 --> 05:31.206
Hmm!

05:31.207 --> 05:33.836
[Dante] Wait-- I was
a crystal the whole time?

05:33.837 --> 05:34.837
Hmm?

05:34.838 --> 05:36.836
Uh, whaaaattt?

05:36.837 --> 05:38.836
That's it! Cricket's done.

05:38.837 --> 05:40.046
Oh, did I miss it?

05:40.047 --> 05:41.836
Uh... Cricket?

05:41.837 --> 05:45.086
[dance music playing]

05:45.087 --> 05:46.546
Okay, coast is clear.

05:46.547 --> 05:49.416
Let's go over the plan
one more time.

05:49.417 --> 05:51.876
Once Gloria's in position,
I drop the bowling ball

05:51.877 --> 05:53.166
onto the seesaw
to activate the lighter,

05:53.167 --> 05:54.416
which ignites
the birthday candle

05:54.417 --> 05:55.666
and burns through this rope.

05:55.667 --> 05:56.876
The rope releases the mallets

05:56.877 --> 05:58.546
that swings right
into the dominoes,

05:58.547 --> 05:59.796
which turns on the fan,

05:59.797 --> 06:01.206
which activates knife car.

06:01.207 --> 06:03.006
Knife car then sails
to the end of the platform

06:03.007 --> 06:05.046
and knocks the weight
off the ledge,

06:05.047 --> 06:06.836
triggering
the garden shears
to cut the rope,

06:06.837 --> 06:08.296
which drops the chandelier,

06:08.297 --> 06:10.546
and boom-- mission accomplished.

06:10.547 --> 06:13.506
All right, let's get started.

06:13.507 --> 06:17.046
- So, okay, he just
doesn't wear shoes?
- Never.

06:17.047 --> 06:19.046
Isn't that, like,
a health code violation
or something?

06:19.047 --> 06:21.586
- That's what I'm saying!
- [fishing reel whirrs]

06:21.587 --> 06:23.296
[Gloria]
Oh, hello.

06:23.297 --> 06:25.966
Uh... I'll be right back.

06:25.967 --> 06:27.546
Ah... gotcha!

06:27.547 --> 06:29.586
Looks like my luck
is finally changing.

06:29.587 --> 06:30.837
[Andromeda]
Tilly, now!

06:32.257 --> 06:35.466
Aah...!

06:35.467 --> 06:38.586
Huh. That rope is
stronger than anticipated.

06:38.587 --> 06:40.166
Tilly Green!

06:40.167 --> 06:41.796
What are you doing?

06:41.797 --> 06:43.336
Hey! She remembers
your name.

06:43.337 --> 06:45.966
Wait. You're cured
of your amnesia?

06:45.967 --> 06:48.006
Amnesia?
That's not even a thing.

06:48.007 --> 06:50.296
Oh-ho, that's what
they want you to think.

06:50.297 --> 06:52.296
But earlier you
didn't remember us.

06:52.297 --> 06:54.756
I was pretending
not to recognize you

06:54.757 --> 06:56.756
so you wouldn't embarrass me
in front of my new friends.

06:56.757 --> 06:58.626
And you, I don't even know you.

06:58.627 --> 07:02.086
- I'm Andromeda.
- But I thought we were
also your friends.

07:02.087 --> 07:04.256
No! You're just
annoying little kids.

07:04.257 --> 07:06.086
Hey, you three!

07:06.087 --> 07:07.876
You need to get out of
my club immediately!

07:07.877 --> 07:09.876
Three? I'm not with them!

07:09.877 --> 07:12.876
Nice try, but I think
I know a group of friends
when I see one.

07:12.877 --> 07:14.126
Come on, let's go!

07:14.127 --> 07:15.626
Oh, you wanna go?

07:15.627 --> 07:17.166
Boy, you messed with the wrong--

07:17.167 --> 07:19.416
Shoulda went for the shins.

07:19.417 --> 07:20.966
They're the eyes of the legs.

07:20.967 --> 07:22.876
And stay out!

07:22.877 --> 07:25.296
Gloria, I'm sorry we got you
kicked out of the club

07:25.297 --> 07:26.916
and assumed we were friends.

07:26.917 --> 07:29.796
I just-- I thought we got
along really well.

07:29.797 --> 07:30.837
We really messed up.

07:32.047 --> 07:34.206
Look, I didn't mean what I said.

07:34.207 --> 07:36.206
I was just really hoping
this night would go well,

07:36.207 --> 07:38.376
and I wanted those girls
to like me.

07:38.377 --> 07:40.376
I've had a hard time
making friends in Big City.

07:40.377 --> 07:43.256
Tonight felt like the perfect
opportunity to make some.

07:43.257 --> 07:46.166
Oh, Gloria, we were
right there with you.

07:46.167 --> 07:47.966
This will probably come
as a shock,

07:47.967 --> 07:50.256
but we also have a hard time
making friends.

07:50.257 --> 07:52.666
Oh, no, my juice is leaking out!

07:52.667 --> 07:53.836
[slurping]

07:53.837 --> 07:56.546
Hmm. Thanks, guys.
You're not too bad.

07:56.547 --> 07:58.046
Well, guess I'll head home

07:58.047 --> 08:00.127
and take off my remaining shoe.

08:01.707 --> 08:04.296
Gloria, remain
in your human form.

08:04.297 --> 08:07.086
Yeah, we're gonna give you
the girls' night you deserve.

08:07.087 --> 08:10.086
Dante, I'm Crystal Man,

08:10.087 --> 08:12.876
and I'm your cousin, probably.

08:12.877 --> 08:14.166
Ugh! Writing is hard.

08:14.167 --> 08:15.466
Hey, son.

08:15.467 --> 08:17.796
You here to somehow
spoil this, too?

08:17.797 --> 08:21.046
No, I just came to apologize
for ruinin' the movie.

08:21.047 --> 08:22.466
I really like that movie,

08:22.467 --> 08:24.256
and I wanted you
to like it, too,

08:24.257 --> 08:26.506
but it seems I got
a little carried away.

08:26.507 --> 08:28.466
Oh, Dad, it was
more than a little.

08:28.467 --> 08:30.966
So you got a little
excited and messed things
up for everyone.

08:30.967 --> 08:32.466
It's okay. I been there.

08:32.467 --> 08:34.046
It's kinda my whole thing.

08:34.047 --> 08:36.046
And you know what?
That movie was really cool.

08:36.047 --> 08:37.836
I'd like to finish
watching it with you.

08:37.837 --> 08:40.006
- Really?
- Yeah, but
under one condition.

08:40.007 --> 08:43.126
Thank you for all
your help, Gleebor.

08:43.127 --> 08:45.546
Gleebor Gleebor!
You're welcome...

08:45.547 --> 08:46.916
...my son!

08:46.917 --> 08:48.376
[rousing music playing]

08:48.377 --> 08:50.086
Wow, what a twist!

08:50.087 --> 08:51.376
[muffled remarks]

08:51.377 --> 08:54.007
Well put, Dad, well put.

08:55.007 --> 08:56.046
There's no way

08:56.047 --> 08:57.376
we're getting past that bouncer.

08:57.377 --> 09:00.006
Oh, don't worry, I can take him.

09:00.007 --> 09:01.086
- Nope. No, no, no.
- We're not gonna use those.

09:01.087 --> 09:03.166
Let's try something
a little more...

09:03.167 --> 09:04.167
subtle.

09:04.168 --> 09:05.876
A bouncy ball?

09:05.877 --> 09:08.466
Everyone knows bouncers
can't resist bouncy balls.

09:08.467 --> 09:09.966
It's in the name, after all.

09:09.967 --> 09:12.296
Hey, you!
You're like me!

09:12.297 --> 09:14.006
We're the same!
We're the same!

09:14.007 --> 09:15.506
Come back here, friend!

09:15.507 --> 09:18.506
So then I was like,
"That was unexpected!"

09:18.507 --> 09:19.666
[laughter]

09:19.667 --> 09:21.256
Am I right, Gloria?

09:21.257 --> 09:24.836
It feels so empty
without her angelic laugh.

09:24.837 --> 09:26.876
[Gloria laughs loudly]

09:26.877 --> 09:28.546
What are we laughing at?
What's the joke?

09:28.547 --> 09:30.466
Uh, Gloria, who are you with?

09:30.467 --> 09:33.046
Hmm? Oh, them?
Uh, they're, uh...

09:33.047 --> 09:35.336
Just a couple of kids
on their way out.

09:35.337 --> 09:37.046
Y'all have a good night.

09:37.047 --> 09:40.006
Actually, these are my friends,
Tilly and Andromeda,

09:40.007 --> 09:41.796
and I was thinking they could
hang out with us tonight.

09:41.797 --> 09:42.966
Hey!

09:42.967 --> 09:44.046
I thought I kicked
you three out!

09:44.047 --> 09:45.466
- Uh...!
- [all panting]

09:45.467 --> 09:47.336
- Come here! Come here!
- Aah!

09:47.337 --> 09:50.546
I'm not letting
any of you three cause
any more damage!

09:50.547 --> 09:52.296
First the spilled drinks,

09:52.297 --> 09:54.046
and then the fire extinguisher.

09:54.047 --> 09:56.046
And that the--
you painted all over my floor!

09:56.047 --> 09:58.336
Oh! Oh! And now you're
not even lookin' at me!

09:58.337 --> 10:00.086
My eyes are down here!

10:00.087 --> 10:01.586
Now you're just bein' rude.

10:01.587 --> 10:03.416
What are you
even lookin' at? Huh?

10:03.417 --> 10:04.706
[crash]

10:04.707 --> 10:05.966
Ohh!

10:05.967 --> 10:08.256
Where am I?
Who am I?

10:08.257 --> 10:11.046
He got amnesia!
Told you it was a thing.

10:11.047 --> 10:11.967
Ohh!

10:11.968 --> 10:14.126
Your name is
Valumus Grimmsberry.

10:14.127 --> 10:16.796
You're the head snake charmer
at the Big City Zoo.

10:16.797 --> 10:19.046
Now, go on. You don't
want to be late for work.

10:19.047 --> 10:20.206
Okay. Thank you.

10:20.207 --> 10:22.006
- [bouncer] Thank you!
- Wow!

10:22.007 --> 10:24.546
Gloria, your friends
are, like, super awesome.

10:24.547 --> 10:26.836
Let's get down
on this dance floor!

10:26.837 --> 10:28.206
Drinks on me!
