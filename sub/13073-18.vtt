00:37.203 --> 00:39.172
I told you guys
the backyard is reserved

00:39.239 --> 00:41.341
for me and Harvey today.

00:41.408 --> 00:42.842
This is gonna be great.
Harvey's gonna love

00:42.909 --> 00:44.477
the picnic spread I prepared.

00:44.544 --> 00:47.080
- Hey, big brother!
I learned how to parallel park.

00:47.147 --> 00:48.848
30 degrees...

00:48.915 --> 00:50.517
and...straight.

you're ruining everything!

Get out, get out, get out!

{\an3}- Oh, this is great.
The cheese spread is ruined.

00:59.659 --> 01:03.663
{\an3}This is great.
I spent so much time on this!

for your shenanigans!

01:12.038 --> 01:13.473
Harvey will be here any minute.

01:13.540 --> 01:16.009
- Oh, Harvey's coming?
I'll hang out too.

01:16.075 --> 01:17.710
I can teach him
this cool stepping routine

01:17.777 --> 01:18.978
I choreographed.

01:21.047 --> 01:22.549
- Wait, stop stepping.
Stop it!

01:22.615 --> 01:25.752
Harvey and I don't wanna
hang out with a little baby.

01:25.819 --> 01:27.053
- I'm not a baby.

01:27.120 --> 01:28.688
I'm six years old.

01:28.755 --> 01:30.023
- Wade, do you need a nap?

01:30.089 --> 01:31.157
Is that what this is about?

01:31.224 --> 01:33.126
{\an1}- Hey, Dade. You ready
for our picnic?

01:33.193 --> 01:34.627
I brought some pitted olives.

01:34.694 --> 01:37.230
I also brought the pits in case
it was presumptuous

01:37.297 --> 01:38.231
of me to remove them.

01:38.298 --> 01:39.265
- Oh my gosh, Harvey!

01:39.332 --> 01:40.500
You're just so thoughtful.

to join us?

01:58.017 --> 01:59.319
- Eh, don't worry about it.

{\an3}You know, I know that guy
gets on your nerves.

02:01.020 --> 02:03.189

Wade is super cool.

He's funny, and he dresses cool,
and he's just fun to be around.

02:07.293 --> 02:10.128

than me, right?

02:10.196 --> 02:11.331

how to parallel park.

Ooh!

what to say.

What's up, Wonder Twins?

05:08.408 --> 05:09.776

{\an3}- Ah man, Wade,
you're all right.

05:12.445 --> 05:14.781

got some stuff

is just kidding.

I'm just being hip.

05:36.936 --> 05:39.405
Uh, y-yo, Harvey, heh...

You're so blue! I mean,
what are you, a blueberry?

05:44.210 --> 05:46.646

I-I didn't mean it. W--

05:50.016 --> 05:51.217

05:51.284 --> 05:53.352
Harvey is sensitive.

05:54.420 --> 05:55.354
- You're mean.

05:55.421 --> 05:56.355
- Wait, wait, wait, wait!

05:56.422 --> 06:00.359
No, no, no, noo!
[crying]

06:00.426 --> 06:03.162
- Wow. That was a lot.

06:03.229 --> 06:05.131

06:05.198 --> 06:06.532
Now Harvey hates me.

06:06.599 --> 06:09.235
{\an3}Oh, what do I do?
This is a disaster.

06:09.302 --> 06:12.371
{\an1}- Well, there's only one way to
get people back on your side.

06:12.438 --> 06:16.409
{\an1}You have to do something
so big, so outrageous,

06:16.476 --> 06:20.279
{\an1}that everyone will know you're
the coolest guy in town.

06:20.346 --> 06:23.282
You have to do a stunt.

06:23.349 --> 06:24.784

06:26.986 --> 06:29.288

This is not news.

<i>Attention everyone.</i>

06:34.994 --> 06:36.195

this is important.

06:37.797 --> 06:40.500
Two hours from now,
I will be launching myself

06:40.566 --> 06:43.770
across Wetbark Lake
with a giant slingshot.

06:43.836 --> 06:46.272
It'll be the most
death-defying stunt

06:46.339 --> 06:48.141
ever performed in
Littlebark Grove.

06:48.207 --> 06:50.810
- Oh, and I'll be there
if y'all wanna play hackey sack.

06:50.877 --> 06:52.845
- I mean, this could be
really dangerous...

06:52.912 --> 06:55.882
it would mean a lot to have
a buddy there to support me.

06:55.948 --> 06:57.984
- Well, I'm not afraid
to admit that

06:58.050 --> 07:00.419
you hurt my feelings
earlier today, Dade.

07:00.486 --> 07:01.988
I guess I'll go.

07:02.054 --> 07:04.757
But only to make sure that
the accommodations are safe.

07:04.824 --> 07:07.493
- Oh, if we get to watch you
get hurt, then we're so there.

07:07.560 --> 07:09.128
{\an3}- Hey, I was just gonna
say that.

07:09.195 --> 07:10.429
- Nice.

07:10.496 --> 07:12.298
- This is gonna go well.

a great idea.

you're really gonna do this.

07:21.207 --> 07:22.809
You're like, a rock star.

07:22.875 --> 07:25.545
- Dade, I'm no safety inspector,

07:25.611 --> 07:27.713
{\an3}but I'd rate this
N for Not Safe.

07:27.780 --> 07:29.282
Why are you even doing it?

07:29.348 --> 07:31.017
{\an1}- Because I just--
I have to!

07:31.083 --> 07:33.986
{\an1}Okay, just stand back there
so you don't get hurt.

07:34.053 --> 07:37.957
- Okay, everyone.
Let's count down together.

07:38.024 --> 07:40.193
all: Ten! Nine! Eight!

07:40.259 --> 07:42.929
Seven! Six! Five!

Four! Three! Two! One!

I can't do it!

07:48.835 --> 07:50.236
No, no, no!

07:50.303 --> 07:53.840
- Hey! He's chickening out.
- This is a rip off.

07:53.906 --> 07:56.442
- This isn't who I am.
I'm--I'm not cool.

07:56.509 --> 07:59.011
I like scrapbooks
and taking baths,

07:59.078 --> 08:00.746
and I like pumpkin rolls.

08:00.813 --> 08:03.616
I like making and eating
pumpkin rolls!

08:03.683 --> 08:05.151
- This is amazing.

08:05.218 --> 08:07.353
He's having a total meltdown.

08:07.420 --> 08:10.389
{\an1}- And, Harvey, I'm sorry
I can't be as cool as Wade.

08:10.456 --> 08:11.858
[sobbing]

08:11.924 --> 08:13.159
Dade, come back!

08:13.226 --> 08:14.527
- [sobbing]

08:14.594 --> 08:16.996
Now you get a taste
of your own medicine.

08:17.063 --> 08:18.231
- Wha--what?

08:18.297 --> 08:19.599
- You call me a baby.

08:19.665 --> 08:21.133
You're always calling me a baby.

08:21.200 --> 08:24.403
You made me feel bad, so now
I'm making you feel bad.

08:24.470 --> 08:26.539
- Wait, you mean this was
all a trick?

08:26.606 --> 08:28.107
So I wasn't setting trends?

08:28.174 --> 08:30.843
{\an1}- No! You're always doing
mean stuff to me.

08:30.910 --> 08:32.712
{\an1}Like when you put toothpaste
in my pants

08:32.778 --> 08:35.347
and told Mom I was
having minty poos.

08:35.414 --> 08:37.116
{\an1}She made me go
to the doctor for that.

08:37.183 --> 08:38.583
- Well, I only did that

08:38.650 --> 08:40.553
{\an3}'cause you dipped
my scrapbook in chocolate!

08:40.620 --> 08:42.688
{\an1}- This is you:
"My name is Dade,

08:42.755 --> 08:45.458

what her problem is.

18:32.845 --> 18:34.346
It's a free kingdom.

18:34.413 --> 18:36.215
- Ugh! Can't you both
just go on

18:36.281 --> 18:38.183
different sides of the castle?

18:38.250 --> 18:39.751
- I don't know
why I got to move.

18:39.818 --> 18:41.220
- Okay, but it's still gonna
be too loud over there.

18:41.286 --> 18:44.790
{\an1}- I'm so bored
I can't feel my face.

18:44.857 --> 18:46.492
I need some fresh air.

18:48.227 --> 18:50.429
{\an3}- Is everything all right,
Your Majesty?

18:50.496 --> 18:53.732
{\an1}- Ugh. I do nothing but
listen to folks complain.

18:53.799 --> 18:57.002
{\an1}I wanted to be a king, Harvey,
not a babysitter.

18:57.069 --> 18:58.570
I need some excitement.

18:58.637 --> 18:59.538
- Hmm.

18:59.605 --> 19:01.373
Well, look on the bright side.

19:01.440 --> 19:04.743
At least no one's trying to
knock down the castle anymore.

19:04.810 --> 19:06.111
- That's right.

19:06.178 --> 19:09.448
Nobody is trying to
knock down the castle.

19:18.357 --> 19:21.260
{\an3}- La-la-la-la
hu-hu-hu.

19:21.326 --> 19:24.897
- Hey, Princess.
How's it going?

19:24.963 --> 19:27.966
Man, I'm so happy it's
the right bathroom this time.

19:28.033 --> 19:30.602
- Ew, what are you
doing in here?

19:30.669 --> 19:32.971
Get out!
[grunting]

19:33.038 --> 19:35.307
{\an1}- Okay.

19:35.374 --> 19:36.708
{\an1}Listen, Princess.
I need to--

19:36.775 --> 19:39.177
{\an1}Stop it!
Look!

19:39.244 --> 19:41.313
This is really weird to say,

19:41.380 --> 19:45.050
but being king
just isn't as fun without you.

19:45.117 --> 19:47.653
You made things...exciting.

19:47.719 --> 19:50.556
I don't know, I guess what
I'm trying to say is--

19:50.622 --> 19:53.625
I'm sorry, but are you
really eating right now?

19:53.692 --> 19:55.160
- Yeah.

19:55.227 --> 19:59.064
- Okay...well, can you
just please come back?

19:59.131 --> 20:01.199
You're so good at
destroying things.

20:01.266 --> 20:04.202
And you're so...smart.

20:04.269 --> 20:06.038
And strong.

20:06.104 --> 20:09.608
Like a big...strong horse?

20:09.675 --> 20:10.876
A smart horse.

20:10.943 --> 20:12.144
- Keep talking.

20:12.210 --> 20:14.780
- And...that's all I got.

20:14.846 --> 20:17.115
So, what do you say?

20:17.182 --> 20:18.317
{\an3}- Dad!

20:18.383 --> 20:19.885
{\an1}- I'm sorry for
getting mad at you!

20:19.952 --> 20:21.320
{\an1}You can destroy
anything you want!

20:21.386 --> 20:23.855
Just please come back.

20:23.922 --> 20:25.991
- Dad, bring me a towel.

20:26.058 --> 20:28.827
I've got a castle to destroy.

20:32.197 --> 20:33.165
- Huh?

20:33.231 --> 20:36.735
Guys, we've got movement.

20:36.802 --> 20:40.339
Princess...and King Fee?

20:40.405 --> 20:42.874
{\an3}- Oh no! Princess
kidnapped the king!

20:42.941 --> 20:44.142
- No, she didn't!

20:44.209 --> 20:45.477
I invited her.

20:45.544 --> 20:46.845
{\an3}- Why the heck
would you do that?

20:46.912 --> 20:49.548
- Because when I decided
to build a castle,

20:49.615 --> 20:52.050
I wanted it to be fun,
not lame.

20:52.117 --> 20:55.354
Then I figured out the best part
was battling with Princess.

20:55.420 --> 20:58.423
- So you want us to attack
Princess again?

20:58.490 --> 21:00.125
- I say do whatever you want.

21:00.192 --> 21:02.094
{\an1}If you wanna defend the castle,
do that.

21:02.160 --> 21:04.930
{\an1}If you wanna attack it,
then do that instead!

21:04.997 --> 21:07.332
Everyone just go crazy!

21:07.399 --> 21:08.600
{\an1}Ooh!

21:08.667 --> 21:12.204
- Sorry, Fee.

{\an1}- Wow, you were right.
That was pretty fun.

21:32.524 --> 21:34.092
{\an3}- What do you wanna do now,
King Fee?

21:34.159 --> 21:35.360
Build another castle?

21:35.427 --> 21:38.196
- Actually, I'm not the king
anymore.

21:38.263 --> 21:41.033
I'm now Supreme Commander Fee!

21:41.099 --> 21:44.803
And we need to repair our space
station to destroy the moon!

21:44.870 --> 21:48.407
{\an3}- And I'll be an evil alien.
Roar!

21:48.473 --> 21:49.908
- Yo, I wanna be the alien!

21:49.975 --> 21:51.143
- I'll be the pilot!

get out of my junkyard!
