00:28.840 --> 00:30.342
The question of happiness

00:30.509 --> 00:32.557
has preoccupied
philosophers, poets

00:32.719 --> 00:35.392
and pharmaceutical companies
for thousands of years.

00:36.598 --> 00:39.225
Clearly, it's a tricky one.

00:39.391 --> 00:42.270
When I graduated from
design school three years ago,

00:42.436 --> 00:45.280
I had a definite plan.

00:45.439 --> 00:49.194
Couple months at home,
put together a kickass portfolio,

00:49.360 --> 00:52.534
then I'd take Manhattan
by storm.

00:54.989 --> 00:56.617
And here is home.

00:57.660 --> 00:59.161
West Orange, New Jersey.

00:59.327 --> 01:01.000
Nice, huh?

01:02.665 --> 01:05.918
OK, it's not Manhattan,
but, like I say, it's temporary.

01:06.084 --> 01:10.008
I grew up here
with two families.

01:10.171 --> 01:12.970
That's my dad in blue,
and that's his best friend, Terry.

01:13.132 --> 01:15.055
The Inseparables.

01:15.218 --> 01:18.438
They go jogging together
three times a week without fail.

01:18.595 --> 01:20.848
You can set your clock by it.

01:21.014 --> 01:23.893
You could say life in the Oranges
is dependable.

01:24.059 --> 01:26.107
I can't believe
you made me do this.

01:26.269 --> 01:29.114
Good for your appetite.
See you in an hour.

01:29.272 --> 01:32.492
You can depend on Terry
to have a gadget for everything.

01:32.651 --> 01:35.494
Walked 1.2 miles.
Only stopped twice.

01:35.653 --> 01:37.030
That's great, honey.

01:37.196 --> 01:39.164
And you can
depend on Cathy

01:39.323 --> 01:41.200
to never hear
a single word he says.

01:41.367 --> 01:43.119
Make sure you put your bicycle
in the garage.

01:43.285 --> 01:45.208
And pull the pork
out of the freezer, honey.

01:46.454 --> 01:50.800
Across the street,
our house.

01:50.960 --> 01:53.428
Every year,
my mom gets more involved

01:53.587 --> 01:55.009
with her carolling group.

01:55.172 --> 01:57.049
They start rehearsing
in August.

01:57.215 --> 01:58.842
# Jingle bells
Jingle all the way... #

01:59.009 --> 02:01.683
And every year, my dad
hates them a little bit more.

02:04.848 --> 02:08.853
OK, sure. I'm still here.
I'm a few years behind in my plan.

02:09.019 --> 02:10.860
But you can't
rush these things.

02:11.020 --> 02:13.990
Portfolios need
to be perfect, right?

02:14.148 --> 02:16.900
Plus I have a day job
working in furniture, so...

02:17.067 --> 02:20.571
...as far as I was concerned,
everything was on track.

02:20.738 --> 02:23.912
# Happy birthday to you... #

02:24.073 --> 02:27.043
That is, until what
happened... happened

02:27.202 --> 02:29.375
Nina Ostroff.

02:29.537 --> 02:32.336
When all this started,
she was at a safe distance,

02:32.498 --> 02:34.625
3, 000 miles away
in San Francisco.

02:34.792 --> 02:38.592
I Happy birthday to you. I

02:38.755 --> 02:41.178
Make a wish, babe.

02:49.765 --> 02:51.233
And I was the fifth wheel

02:51.391 --> 02:53.735
to our parents'
regular Saturday foursome.

02:53.894 --> 02:55.646
Say it again.

02:55.811 --> 02:57.154
OK.

02:57.314 --> 02:59.736
Un coup de birch.

02:59.900 --> 03:01.446
Hey, Vanny.

03:01.610 --> 03:03.156
I read the most
interesting article

03:03.319 --> 03:05.162
called 'The IKEA Conspiracy',

03:05.321 --> 03:06.994
which you'd be
really fascinated by.

03:07.156 --> 03:08.533
- What it imagines is a...
- Terry?

03:08.699 --> 03:10.246
We need to call Nina.
We said 9:30.

03:10.409 --> 03:11.911
I'm on it.

03:12.078 --> 03:14.376
Vanessa, did you look at
that one-bedroom in Fort Lee?

03:14.537 --> 03:17.838
Yeah. It was, um, like a closet
in the basement.

03:17.999 --> 03:19.421
There's always something, honey.

03:19.584 --> 03:20.962
Don't be so choosy.
Nothing's perfect.

03:21.127 --> 03:23.381
There was, you know,
one window.

03:23.546 --> 03:25.469
- Paige, did I tell you...
- No room to breathe.

03:25.632 --> 03:27.384
...that Joan Marshack
was the listing agent on that?

03:27.550 --> 03:30.474
David, you are going
to really love this.

03:30.637 --> 03:35.643
This speaker box communicates
wirelessly with my cell phone.

03:35.809 --> 03:37.982
And guess where
I read about it first.

03:38.143 --> 03:40.237
'Consumer Reports'. Thank you
so much for the subscription.

03:40.397 --> 03:42.741
- I'm really enjoying it.
- You are consumingly welcome.

03:42.898 --> 03:46.118
I don't even have to take
my cell phone out of my pocket.

03:46.276 --> 03:47.654
Watch.

03:47.820 --> 03:49.742
Dial Nina.

03:49.905 --> 03:51.407
Please repeat request.

03:51.572 --> 03:52.950
Dial Nina.

03:53.117 --> 03:55.290
Maybe your pants
are blocking the signal.

03:55.451 --> 03:56.953
They're cotton.

03:58.454 --> 04:01.207
Nina's cell phone, dialling.

04:03.084 --> 04:06.213
Nina - their daughter
and my best friend

04:06.379 --> 04:08.473
from ages 0
to high school.

04:08.631 --> 04:11.134
We spent hours together
planning our big escape.

04:11.301 --> 04:13.348
I'm gonna live in New York.

04:13.510 --> 04:14.887
And Paris.

04:15.053 --> 04:17.397
And I'm gonna be a famous chef
and have a million lovers

04:17.555 --> 04:18.933
who'll take me
all over the world

04:19.099 --> 04:21.317
so I never have to come back
to New Jersey again.

04:21.476 --> 04:24.320
It's like
there's no air here, right?

04:24.478 --> 04:26.152
Totally.

04:28.941 --> 04:30.444
You'll come too, right?

04:30.609 --> 04:32.611
Are you kidding?

04:33.864 --> 04:35.706
Until sophomore year,

04:35.865 --> 04:40.336
when she abandoned me for
Liz Gaines and the Fun Bunch.

04:43.039 --> 04:47.418
She also kissed and later gave
a hand job to Peter Fortunate.

04:47.585 --> 04:50.838
I'd been secretly
in love with him forever.

04:52.005 --> 04:54.053
Then, just as her parents
were lining her up

04:54.215 --> 04:56.092
at some lame college
in Pennsylvania,

04:56.259 --> 04:58.808
she decided she was
going to travel the world.

04:58.970 --> 05:01.519
Or at least those parts

05:01.680 --> 05:03.682
that were out of
her mothefs cell phone range.

05:07.227 --> 05:08.945
Hello?

05:09.104 --> 05:11.607
Happy birthday, sweetie!

05:11.774 --> 05:13.492
- Happy birthday!
- Happy birthday, Nina.

05:13.651 --> 05:16.620
It's David and Paige.
Vanessa's here too.

05:16.779 --> 05:18.576
It's true. I'm here.

05:18.739 --> 05:20.082
Hey, Ethan.

05:20.239 --> 05:23.084
I think Nina's fucking parents
are on the phone.

05:24.912 --> 05:27.460
I didn't know I was having
a party. It was a surprise.

05:27.622 --> 05:29.795
Honey, we can't hear you.

05:29.957 --> 05:32.676
Ethan threw me
a surprise party.

05:32.835 --> 05:34.633
It's so great.

05:34.796 --> 05:36.173
Did you guys get
the pictures I sent?

05:36.339 --> 05:38.137
Yes, we did.

05:38.298 --> 05:40.051
More young men should have earrings
in their face.

05:40.218 --> 05:42.720
What? I'm sorry, I can't
hear you. Am I on speaker?

05:42.886 --> 05:46.766
Nina, what day are you
flying in for Thanksgiving?

05:46.932 --> 05:50.106
Thanksgiving. Mom, um...

05:51.728 --> 05:54.277
Uh, I don't think I'm gonna
make it for Thanksgiving.

05:54.438 --> 05:57.693
Ethan's photography show's
next weekend, and it's a big deal.

05:57.858 --> 05:59.735
Sweetie, we haven't
seen you for two years.

05:59.902 --> 06:01.324
You haven't been home
in five years.

06:01.487 --> 06:03.286
Since we visited you.
That's a long time.

06:03.447 --> 06:04.824
Um...

06:04.991 --> 06:07.084
Can you take me
off speaker, please?

06:07.243 --> 06:08.745
Sorry, sweetie,
I'd have to disconnect you

06:08.911 --> 06:10.959
to take you off speaker -
it's a very complex system.

06:11.122 --> 06:12.169
OK.

06:13.623 --> 06:16.594
Look, you're not
gonna like this, but...

06:16.751 --> 06:18.924
Ethan and I
are getting married.

06:19.087 --> 06:22.341
He proposed two weeks ago
on his birthday.

06:22.507 --> 06:24.180
He took me out
to Baker Beach,

06:24.342 --> 06:25.719
which overlooks
the Golden Gate Bridge,

06:25.885 --> 06:27.808
and he got down on one knee
and everything.

06:27.971 --> 06:31.520
- He proposed on his birthday?
- I don't understand.

06:31.683 --> 06:33.525
I'm in love with him.

06:34.561 --> 06:36.655
That's really great,
sweetie, but...

06:36.812 --> 06:38.940
You're only 24 years old.

06:39.106 --> 06:41.029
Nobody gets married
at 24 anymore.

06:41.191 --> 06:43.114
People get married
when they're 17.

06:43.277 --> 06:44.699
Not white girls
from New Jersey.

06:44.862 --> 06:46.488
- Shh!
- Would you listen to yourself?

06:46.655 --> 06:48.328
No, you listen -
you have made some

06:48.489 --> 06:50.787
very questionable decisions
in your life.

06:50.950 --> 06:52.372
Please don't
add to the list

06:52.535 --> 06:56.382
by marrying some loser kid
with zero future.

06:56.539 --> 06:59.634
OK. I have an idea.

06:59.792 --> 07:04.013
If you think he's such a loser,
then don't come to the wedding!

07:08.633 --> 07:10.385
Jesus, turn that thing down!

07:12.846 --> 07:17.477
Down volume!
Down volume!

07:17.643 --> 07:21.021
- Oh, God!
- Down volume!

07:27.194 --> 07:30.572
You guys, it's getting late.
The party's over, OK?

07:30.738 --> 07:32.581
Love you. 'Bye.

07:32.740 --> 07:34.287
Amy, did you see Ethan?

07:35.493 --> 07:36.995
Baby?

07:37.161 --> 07:39.413
Ethan?

07:43.541 --> 07:45.010
Ethan?

07:45.168 --> 07:47.591
Uh, it's...
Gimme a sec.

07:47.754 --> 07:50.223
Come on. I want to
get everybody out of here.

08:05.104 --> 08:07.231
Hey, how's it going with
the, uh, couples counsellor?

08:07.398 --> 08:10.071
I don't know.
She's so non-specific.

08:10.234 --> 08:12.987
It's like talking to fog.

08:13.153 --> 08:15.406
David and I know
where we stand with each other.

08:15.571 --> 08:18.041
That's how we've lasted this long.
Somehow, it works.

08:18.200 --> 08:21.875
Well, don't look at me.
I just pretend Terry's invisible.

08:22.036 --> 08:24.664
- Notice anything different?
- I sure do.

08:24.831 --> 08:26.628
Nice new mini fridge.

08:26.791 --> 08:28.294
I think it really
ties the room together.

08:28.459 --> 08:31.008
-It's the Max 5950.
-It's the one you recommended.

08:31.170 --> 08:33.138
From the patio series.
Good move.

08:33.296 --> 08:35.424
Let's take a look
in the mini ice compartment.

08:36.758 --> 08:38.760
Oh, boy.
It's really big, isn't it?

08:38.927 --> 08:42.147
Now, this stuff is huge
in Europe.

08:42.306 --> 08:44.899
And we've just landed
the American campaign.

08:45.058 --> 08:46.685
- No kidding? Congrats.
- Thanks.

08:46.851 --> 08:48.944
Russians like it
for breakfast.

08:51.815 --> 08:53.532
Before the devil
knows you're dead.

08:57.028 --> 08:58.870
Boy, it's, um...

08:59.030 --> 09:00.622
Well...
Really not very good, is it?

09:00.781 --> 09:02.704
-It's not good at all. No.
- No.

09:08.539 --> 09:10.085
What's up
with these sheets?

09:11.458 --> 09:13.586
You, um...

09:13.752 --> 09:15.629
...spending a little extra time
out here?

09:15.795 --> 09:18.049
Just a couple of nights a week.

09:18.214 --> 09:20.684
Late-night TV.

09:45.616 --> 09:48.540
You've gotta be
fucking kidding me.

09:55.833 --> 09:57.961
Oh, sh...

10:10.806 --> 10:12.398
Nina? Wow!

10:12.557 --> 10:15.481
- David. Hi.
- It's been so long.

10:16.978 --> 10:19.856
I thought you weren't
coming back for Thanksgiving.

10:20.023 --> 10:21.991
Yeah, well...

10:22.149 --> 10:23.993
Um...

10:25.611 --> 10:28.911
Are my parents here?
Locked out.

10:29.073 --> 10:31.417
They're in the back.

10:31.575 --> 10:34.328
Last day of barbecue season.

10:36.871 --> 10:39.250
What's going on?

10:39.416 --> 10:41.088
- You OK?
- David?

10:41.251 --> 10:43.753
Paige wants to know what
you did with the tong thing.

10:45.213 --> 10:46.965
Hi, Mom.

10:47.132 --> 10:50.385
I'm back for Thanksgiving.

10:50.551 --> 10:52.804
We turned it into
a second den.

10:52.970 --> 10:54.688
If your father's
in the first den

10:54.847 --> 10:56.473
and I want some privacy,
I come here.

10:56.641 --> 10:58.062
Honey,
I have this really cool

10:58.226 --> 10:59.603
self-inflating mattress.

10:59.768 --> 11:02.443
It fits perfectly in the corner
and it is really comfy.

11:04.940 --> 11:07.534
But, you know, we have your
old bed frame out there in the...

11:07.693 --> 11:09.661
...in the garage -
I can set it up for you.

11:09.820 --> 11:12.039
- Take me two...two se...
- No, that's fine.

11:12.196 --> 11:14.198
I'll only be here
a few days.

11:14.365 --> 11:16.915
Why? Where are you
going to now?

11:17.076 --> 11:19.626
I don't know.

11:21.456 --> 11:23.458
I haven't figured it out yet.

11:23.625 --> 11:25.592
Well, why don't you
stay here for a while?

11:25.751 --> 11:27.253
I don't care -
it's not like we haven't

11:27.420 --> 11:29.673
gotten used
to you being gone.

11:30.881 --> 11:32.382
Can you hold off
on the guilt trips

11:32.550 --> 11:33.927
for just a little while,
please?

11:34.092 --> 11:35.720
I've had
a rough couple days.

11:37.804 --> 11:40.432
I'd never seen Nina
with her tail between her legs.

11:40.598 --> 11:43.352
But I didn't
have time to gloat.

11:43.518 --> 11:46.692
Back on our side of the street,
we had our own problems.

11:46.855 --> 11:48.277
That's not what I'm saying.

11:48.440 --> 11:50.488
- What about Christmas?
- Come on, Paige.

11:50.650 --> 11:53.904
- I'm trying here.
- Oh. Now I'm not trying.

11:55.196 --> 11:56.913
Can't we have
a simple conversation?

11:57.073 --> 12:01.123
- I make one suggestion...
- I don't want to go down there.

12:01.285 --> 12:04.164
- You seem oblivious...
- Come on, Paige...

12:11.461 --> 12:13.805
I apologise
for what I said about Ethan.

12:13.964 --> 12:16.842
- Were you waiting for me?
- I'm not your enemy. Nina!

12:17.008 --> 12:18.556
When you're a parent
some day,

12:18.718 --> 12:20.186
you'll understand
what it feels like

12:20.344 --> 12:22.221
to have your child hate you.

12:23.306 --> 12:25.274
In case you're wondering,
that's your cue to say,

12:25.432 --> 12:26.810
"I don't hate you, Mom."

12:26.976 --> 12:28.444
I don't hate you.

12:28.602 --> 12:33.529
I just get furious
thinking someone has hurt you.

12:37.319 --> 12:40.869
Don't think I'm crazy.
This is just a thought. But, uh...

12:42.324 --> 12:44.792
Toby's coming home
for Thanksgiving.

12:46.619 --> 12:49.248
- Oh, my God.
- He's gotten very attractive.

12:49.414 --> 12:50.835
That's all I'm saying.

12:50.999 --> 12:53.001
He works for
the Federal Trade Commission.

12:53.167 --> 12:54.589
Terrific. You date him.

12:54.752 --> 12:56.629
Well, it's not like you two
don't have history.

12:56.796 --> 12:58.389
- We kissed!
- Yeah.

12:58.547 --> 12:59.924
Once, like, 10 years ago.

13:00.090 --> 13:02.638
Can you at least let me unpack
before pimping me out?

13:02.802 --> 13:05.601
OK, fine. But I'm gonna
tell you this for your own good.

13:05.762 --> 13:08.686
You need to have a real
relationship with a real man.

13:08.849 --> 13:11.397
It's time you grew up already!
Stop running away.

13:11.559 --> 13:14.688
You know, you're right.
I'm being selfish.

13:14.854 --> 13:16.356
The best thing
I can do right now

13:16.523 --> 13:17.900
is fulfil
your insane suburban fantasy

13:18.065 --> 13:19.443
where I marry
your best friend's son.

13:19.609 --> 13:23.159
Now, you go call the catering hall
and I'll lube my vagina.

13:23.321 --> 13:25.869
That was uncalled for.

13:26.032 --> 13:27.578
Uh, there's 12 of us
in the delegation.

13:27.742 --> 13:29.368
I'm really just...
just assisting my boss.

13:29.535 --> 13:31.583
But the goal is to
tie our trade agreements

13:31.745 --> 13:33.588
to stricter
environmental regulations

13:33.747 --> 13:35.966
since things
are kind of a mess over there.

13:37.417 --> 13:40.091
- China. That's great.
- Yeah, thanks.

13:40.253 --> 13:42.130
You are gonna have
a great experience.

13:42.297 --> 13:44.719
- Yeah. Yeah.
- It's, like, a 30-hour flight.

13:44.883 --> 13:47.010
- Honey, what about Christmas?
- Don't worry, Mom.

13:47.176 --> 13:48.553
I fly back on the 24th.

13:48.719 --> 13:50.312
That sounds
really great, Toby.

13:50.471 --> 13:53.350
I hear that ultimate frisbee
is exploding over there.

13:53.515 --> 13:55.688
In China. The, uh...

13:55.852 --> 13:59.482
The Beijing club team
came in second at the World's.

13:59.647 --> 14:01.319
If I see a game,
I'll let 'em know

14:01.482 --> 14:04.655
I grew up across the street
from the guy who invented it.

14:04.818 --> 14:08.539
Well. It wasn't just me. It was
also Jared Kass and, uh...

14:08.697 --> 14:10.415
- Honey?
- Joel Silver.

14:10.574 --> 14:12.247
Of course, Joel gets
most of the, you know...

14:12.408 --> 14:15.208
...most of the play, being
a big movie producer and all.

14:15.370 --> 14:17.714
Finally!

14:20.250 --> 14:22.468
Where there's dessert,
there's hope.

14:26.797 --> 14:30.176
Your mom told me about what
happened with that Ethan guy.

14:30.342 --> 14:32.344
You OK?

14:35.973 --> 14:37.349
Yeah.

14:37.516 --> 14:39.735
I'm good, thanks.

14:41.102 --> 14:43.104
So, what about you?

14:43.271 --> 14:45.365
How's the liquor
advertising business going?

14:45.523 --> 14:47.366
Still pushing booze
onto minors?

14:47.525 --> 14:50.073
Yes, I am.

14:50.236 --> 14:51.612
Actually,
I just got a promotion.

14:51.779 --> 14:53.371
I'm now executive
vice-president,

14:53.531 --> 14:54.907
creative accounts.

14:55.073 --> 14:56.666
Congratulations.

14:56.826 --> 14:59.045
Was that something
you wanted?

14:59.202 --> 15:01.330
Not really.

15:01.496 --> 15:03.498
You want me to spoon this
onto the plates?

15:03.665 --> 15:05.212
Please.

15:05.375 --> 15:09.005
Uh... Don't just eat it
right out the carton.

15:11.840 --> 15:14.843
Is it good?

15:17.136 --> 15:18.604
- It's cold.
- What?

15:18.763 --> 15:22.938
Hey. I brought that ice-cream
for the pies.

15:23.100 --> 15:25.068
He made me eat it.

15:26.353 --> 15:28.197
Well, Cathy wants
to serve dessert.

15:28.355 --> 15:30.199
Will you please
bring in some plates?

15:32.567 --> 15:35.036
I still need Christmas lists
from everyone by tonight.

15:35.195 --> 15:36.572
I'm leaving early tomorrow.

15:36.738 --> 15:38.831
- Black Friday.
- Don't make fun.

15:38.990 --> 15:42.961
Last year, I got there at 3am
and I was still 210 in line.

15:43.119 --> 15:44.621
Why would anyone
want to shop

15:44.787 --> 15:46.461
on the same day
as everyone else?

15:46.623 --> 15:48.625
I hear that
they have fist fights

15:48.791 --> 15:50.589
and people throw their children
at each other.

15:50.752 --> 15:53.721
Terry! No.
It's really a very...

15:53.879 --> 15:57.929
Very communal, Christmassy
experience. It's beautiful.

15:58.091 --> 15:59.514
Listen, I know it's late,

15:59.676 --> 16:01.224
but I think
we should have a toast.

16:01.386 --> 16:03.855
It's Thanksgiving. We have
so much to be thankful for.

16:04.014 --> 16:06.266
Toby is going to China.

16:06.432 --> 16:07.809
Very exciting.

16:07.976 --> 16:10.650
Nina is finally
back at home.

16:10.812 --> 16:13.691
And Vanessa
continues to live among us,

16:13.856 --> 16:15.608
bringing us joy every day.

16:15.775 --> 16:17.742
To the Walling
and Ostroff clans.

16:17.902 --> 16:21.622
Who knew that two families
could get this close?

16:21.781 --> 16:23.157
Hear, hear.

16:23.323 --> 16:25.997
I still think we could be
a little closer.

16:28.078 --> 16:30.456
Well said.

16:32.582 --> 16:35.802
Man, I thought your mom
was going to applaud

16:35.961 --> 16:37.338
when she saw us
leave together.

16:37.504 --> 16:40.473
The woman
is a total lunatic.

16:40.632 --> 16:42.555
In the first three years
I was gone,

16:42.717 --> 16:44.594
she sent me
letters from the cat.

16:44.760 --> 16:47.104
"Dear Nina,
Don't be difficult.

16:47.264 --> 16:48.731
"Call your mother
on her birthday."

16:48.889 --> 16:51.358
That's great, actually.
I kind of like that.

16:51.517 --> 16:54.111
Now you understand
why I never came back.

16:55.187 --> 16:57.359
Yeah. No, I hear ya. But...

16:57.523 --> 17:00.150
I'm glad you did.

17:01.526 --> 17:02.619
Shut up.

17:06.948 --> 17:08.746
Dance with me.

17:10.451 --> 17:11.999
Totally.

17:15.832 --> 17:17.458
You OK?

17:17.624 --> 17:19.002
I need to get some water.

17:19.167 --> 17:21.136
- Can I get some water?
- OK. Sit down, wild man.

17:21.296 --> 17:24.925
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

17:30.262 --> 17:32.060
- Hey.
- Toby needs water.

17:32.221 --> 17:34.065
What are you doing up?

17:34.223 --> 17:37.568
Just watching a little TV
in the man cave.

17:37.728 --> 17:40.981
- Man cave?
- It's the pool house.

17:41.147 --> 17:44.026
I got one of those
worldwide sports...

17:44.191 --> 17:46.410
...something something package
your dad recommended.

17:46.569 --> 17:48.867
There's this
Korean basketball league

17:49.030 --> 17:50.747
which is completely crazy.

17:50.907 --> 17:53.125
You know, it's not good
to eat peanut butter

17:53.283 --> 17:54.660
this late at night.

17:54.826 --> 17:56.204
It'll make you fat.

17:56.369 --> 17:58.292
I'm not fat.

17:58.455 --> 18:00.253
You will be if you
keep eating like that

18:00.415 --> 18:01.791
at 2:00 in the morning.

18:01.958 --> 18:03.676
And where'd you pick
this little factoid up?

18:03.835 --> 18:05.508
I worked in
a lot of restaurants.

18:05.669 --> 18:07.888
Restaurants
that serve peanut butter?

18:08.048 --> 18:10.141
Look, do whatever you want.

18:10.300 --> 18:12.848
I'm just saying
that you wouldn't look good fat.

18:15.429 --> 18:17.397
I should get back downstairs.

18:17.556 --> 18:19.399
Yeah, make your mother
very happy. You know that.

18:19.558 --> 18:20.935
It's what I live for.

19:10.356 --> 19:12.358
- Hi.
- Hi.

19:13.609 --> 19:15.201
What happened to Toby?

19:15.361 --> 19:17.363
I cut him up
in little pieces

19:17.530 --> 19:19.407
and put him in the fridge
for later.

19:26.913 --> 19:28.540
Who's playing?

19:30.208 --> 19:32.131
I have no idea.

19:32.294 --> 19:34.216
It's...it's the, um...

19:36.673 --> 19:38.845
...guys in red against the...
the guys in white.

19:39.009 --> 19:40.726
- White. I got it.
- Yeah. Yeah.

19:40.886 --> 19:42.979
Go, reds.

19:43.137 --> 19:44.890
Or White.

19:45.055 --> 19:46.807
You know.

20:32.391 --> 20:34.485
Oh, fuck.

20:37.605 --> 20:41.075
One bedroom, high ceilings.
Close to the PATH train.

20:41.234 --> 20:43.110
Ooh, washer dryer.

20:43.277 --> 20:45.951
- Plus it's crazy bright.
- Yeah.

20:46.112 --> 20:48.787
Well, that's morning light.

20:48.950 --> 20:50.872
I don't want that.

20:51.034 --> 20:54.005
Wow, that's, like,
your best excuse in two weeks.

20:54.162 --> 20:55.789
Hello, Koosers.

20:55.957 --> 20:57.958
- Did you sell that dresser?
- I did not.

20:58.124 --> 20:59.626
She's not interested
in the apartment, Henry.

20:59.793 --> 21:01.170
I told you.

21:01.336 --> 21:02.929
What?

21:03.088 --> 21:04.760
What do you mean,
"I told you"?

21:04.923 --> 21:07.722
You've been talking about
moving out for two years.

21:07.883 --> 21:09.727
You know what?
I'm saving money. Alright?

21:09.885 --> 21:11.979
I have a very definite plan.

21:12.137 --> 21:14.436
You mean that "stay at home,
corrode your soul" plan?

21:14.598 --> 21:16.646
No, no - the plan
where I move to the city

21:16.809 --> 21:18.356
and I work with
a big designer.

21:18.519 --> 21:20.738
I've already made
serious contacts.

21:20.896 --> 21:22.819
From where'?

21:22.982 --> 21:28.488
Huffman Koos? Well, you know me
and her and Marlon.

21:28.653 --> 21:31.453
Hey, I'm serious.
We're worried about you.

21:31.614 --> 21:33.867
OK, thank you.
I got it under control.

21:34.033 --> 21:35.626
You guys
go worry about yourselves.

21:38.705 --> 21:40.582
Wow. There she is.

21:40.747 --> 21:44.092
1 pm. Very impressive.

21:44.252 --> 21:46.629
So? Did you have fun
last night?

21:46.795 --> 21:48.547
I'm sure you'd love
a full report.

21:48.714 --> 21:50.808
You know,
some mothers and daughters

21:50.966 --> 21:53.719
actually talk about
these things, like friends.

21:53.884 --> 21:56.103
It's not happening.

21:56.263 --> 22:00.234
Well, maybe Toby will be
better company than you.

22:00.391 --> 22:01.859
Hi!

22:08.524 --> 22:10.322
Try and control yourself.

22:15.196 --> 22:16.494
Hey, Nina.

22:16.656 --> 22:19.830
- Morning, Cathy.
- Good morning, Tobias.

22:19.993 --> 22:22.747
- Uh, you forgot your sweater.
- Thank you.

22:22.913 --> 22:24.789
Can I get you
some breakfast, honey?

22:24.956 --> 22:27.254
No, thanks. I'm OK. Thanks.

22:28.792 --> 22:30.887
Well, I'll give you two
some privacy.

22:31.046 --> 22:33.889
There you are.

22:37.344 --> 22:39.221
I can hear you
hovering out there!

22:39.386 --> 22:40.980
Fine.

22:42.348 --> 22:44.100
You're looking a little crispy
this morning.

22:44.266 --> 22:46.394
Oh, thank you.
You can really put 'em away.

22:46.560 --> 22:49.439
Did I, uh...
Did I pass out?

22:49.605 --> 22:51.528
Yeah. Mmm, pretty much.

22:51.689 --> 22:53.987
Sorry about that.

22:54.150 --> 22:56.779
- No.
- Um...

22:57.987 --> 22:59.864
Look.
Uh, I was thinking.

23:00.031 --> 23:04.628
I had a really fun time last night
before passing out, and...

23:04.786 --> 23:07.005
...I'm supposed to have dinner
with my folks tonight.

23:07.163 --> 23:09.962
And being as
I'm leaving in two days,

23:10.123 --> 23:14.879
I thought, you know,
maybe you'd like to join us

23:15.045 --> 23:17.264
so we could
hang out more.

23:17.422 --> 23:22.598
Yeah. Dinner with you and
your parents, it...sounds great.

23:27.848 --> 23:30.147
- Come on, Toby.
- Hold.

23:32.061 --> 23:33.779
Alright. OK.

23:33.938 --> 23:35.940
- Let's go, Toby.
- Hold.

23:36.107 --> 23:39.953
Toby, it's called
the fast-moving tile game.

23:40.111 --> 23:42.113
Hold.

23:45.074 --> 23:47.042
- Let's go, Toby.
- Hold!

23:47.200 --> 23:49.669
OK. OK.

23:49.829 --> 23:51.546
Actually,
just go out ahead of me.

23:51.705 --> 23:53.502
Oh!

23:53.665 --> 23:56.293
5, the 13. I'm out!

23:56.459 --> 23:59.178
- What?
- Ah. Yes.

23:59.337 --> 24:00.964
Now, who's gonna help me
with the dishes?

24:01.131 --> 24:02.677
I will, Mom. Wait.

24:02.841 --> 24:04.843
Hang on a sec.
I gotta take this. It's work.

24:05.009 --> 24:06.635
This is Toby.

24:06.802 --> 24:08.350
Oh, hello, sir.

24:08.512 --> 24:09.890
Uh-huh.

24:10.055 --> 24:11.432
- No, no, it's no problem.
- Yeah.

24:11.599 --> 24:13.350
I think maybe
I'll go pick up a movie

24:13.517 --> 24:15.064
in case you want to
watch something later.

24:15.227 --> 24:18.151
- That sounds fun.
- I'll come with you.

24:18.313 --> 24:21.032
Keep you company
while Toby does the dishes.

24:32.076 --> 24:33.498
Look.

24:33.661 --> 24:36.834
What happened last night
was a mistake.

24:36.998 --> 24:39.342
- OK?
- No, you're right.

24:42.211 --> 24:45.511
Relax, OK?
It was nothing.

24:45.672 --> 24:47.970
And you stopped it.
You're absolved.

24:58.726 --> 25:00.444
Hello in there?

25:00.603 --> 25:02.231
Is there anyone in there?

25:02.396 --> 25:05.445
You just have to
instigate trouble.

25:05.608 --> 25:08.532
I do not instigate trouble.

25:08.694 --> 25:10.071
Well, OK.

25:10.237 --> 25:11.830
Well, then, Why'd you
come to dinner tonight?

25:11.988 --> 25:13.366
Toby invited me.

25:13.532 --> 25:15.375
And now that we're
talking about instigators,

25:15.534 --> 25:17.456
you leaned into me.

25:17.619 --> 25:19.247
I leaned into you?

25:19.412 --> 25:21.335
- I leaned... I did not lean.
- Yes, you did.

25:21.498 --> 25:23.126
- You leaned into me.
- What?!

25:23.291 --> 25:25.385
Oh... He said, she said.

25:27.127 --> 25:28.505
He said, she said.

25:28.671 --> 25:30.422
Where did that come from?

25:30.589 --> 25:32.591
I have no idea
where that came from.

25:39.056 --> 25:40.979
I'm not instigating.

26:07.499 --> 26:08.921
I've been thinking
about getting

26:09.084 --> 26:11.179
one of those
giant electric snow globes.

26:11.336 --> 26:14.510
You ever seen one of those?
Really big ones?

26:14.673 --> 26:16.767
Fantastic.

26:16.925 --> 26:18.973
Mom?

26:19.135 --> 26:21.308
We're in here, honey.

26:21.470 --> 26:24.065
I'm going out.

26:24.223 --> 26:26.396
Well!

26:26.560 --> 26:29.188
Well, don't you look nice?

26:29.353 --> 26:30.947
Thanks.

26:31.105 --> 26:32.608
So is Toby
taking you somewhere?

26:32.773 --> 26:35.652
- Uh, yeah.
- OK. OK.

26:35.818 --> 26:37.240
- Fine.
- Mom!

26:37.403 --> 26:39.201
Give me some room.

26:39.362 --> 26:41.741
Fine. Have fun.

26:45.827 --> 26:47.501
Is she eating with us?

26:47.662 --> 26:50.666
Toby is taking her out.
She was all dressed up.

26:50.832 --> 26:52.630
- Toby already left for DC.
- What?

26:52.792 --> 26:54.260
Yeah, first thing
this morning.

26:54.419 --> 26:56.342
Some congressman wanted
to be with the delegation

26:56.503 --> 26:58.131
before they went to China.

27:28.868 --> 27:31.996
"Left this morning."
Oh, shit!

27:44.674 --> 27:46.847
- H-hello?
- Mom?

27:47.010 --> 27:49.104
Listen. I lied earlier.

27:49.262 --> 27:51.105
I'm not going out with Toby.

27:51.264 --> 27:53.061
He actually left for Washington
this morning.

27:53.224 --> 27:56.067
- Oh?
- Yeah.

27:56.227 --> 28:00.572
I'm meeting Meredith Lovett.
Remember her?

28:00.731 --> 28:03.154
I didn't tell you because
I know you don't like her.

28:03.317 --> 28:07.538
Oh, honey, thank you.
Thank you for telling me.

28:07.696 --> 28:11.666
You know...
You don't have to lie to me.

28:11.825 --> 28:13.953
I know.

28:14.119 --> 28:15.916
So where are you going?

28:17.581 --> 28:20.926
Uh, we're going to the Regal
to see a movie.

28:23.002 --> 28:24.379
Uh, Mom?

28:24.545 --> 28:27.173
Thanks...for being so cool

28:27.339 --> 28:29.683
and letting me come back
and stay and everything.

28:29.842 --> 28:32.812
I've been feeling really
tossed around lately, so...

28:32.969 --> 28:36.519
You know.
Thanks for being there.

28:38.058 --> 28:40.561
OK, well...
I'll see you later for dinner.

28:45.732 --> 28:47.358
Oh, my...

29:25.770 --> 29:27.067
Whoa!

29:27.230 --> 29:29.358
Cathy.

29:29.524 --> 29:31.821
- What are you...?
- I'm, uh...

29:31.984 --> 29:34.533
- What are you...
- I'm not, uh... Nothing.

29:34.695 --> 29:38.370
Paige and I had a fight,
and I spent the night here. So...

29:40.367 --> 29:42.915
Oh, my God!

29:43.078 --> 29:44.750
Hey, Nina.

29:44.912 --> 29:46.414
- What are you...
- Oh, my God!

29:46.581 --> 29:48.083
Cathy! Slow down.

29:48.250 --> 29:51.594
Slow down? I can read
an ice bucket, David.

29:51.753 --> 29:53.881
- Cathy.
- Oh, my God!

29:54.046 --> 29:57.016
I'm gonna throw up!

30:02.345 --> 30:04.974
- Jesus, David!
- Paige, listen to me.

30:05.141 --> 30:07.143
Just tell me how long
it's been going on.

30:07.309 --> 30:09.562
We kissed. That's it.

30:09.728 --> 30:12.277
Then what the hell were you
doing in a goddamn motel room?

30:12.438 --> 30:14.157
This...

30:15.984 --> 30:18.611
I'm sorry.
The whole thing was wrong.

30:18.778 --> 30:20.156
But let's be honest.

30:20.321 --> 30:22.494
Things have not been good
between us for a long time.

30:22.656 --> 30:24.203
Oh, God, don't do that.

30:24.366 --> 30:26.869
Don't apologise and then
blame me in the same sentence.

30:27.036 --> 30:29.130
Come on, Paige.
You're not happy either.

30:29.288 --> 30:31.791
It's not about
being happy, David!

30:31.957 --> 30:33.959
Well, then, what is it?

30:54.353 --> 30:56.197
Jesus, say something already.

30:56.355 --> 30:58.403
I will say something
when I want.

30:58.565 --> 31:01.068
You don't get to decide
when I say something. I decide!

31:01.235 --> 31:03.784
- Then decide already!
- I'll decide.

31:03.946 --> 31:07.371
You have caused
some serious trouble

31:07.533 --> 31:08.875
in the past, young lady.

31:09.034 --> 31:10.502
Don't you
roll your eyes at me.

31:10.660 --> 31:12.708
I'm sorry, it doesn't work
when you try to play

31:12.871 --> 31:14.669
the stern father - it looks like
you're pretending.

31:14.831 --> 31:17.004
Your father is not pretending!
We are furious!

31:17.166 --> 31:18.634
I'm not pretending.

31:18.794 --> 31:20.420
David and I,
we like each other.

31:20.586 --> 31:22.930
- Oh, my God.
- We've always been close.

31:23.088 --> 31:25.217
It's not like we planned this.
It just happened.

31:25.382 --> 31:27.056
- You like each other?
- Yeah.

31:27.218 --> 31:28.595
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God!

31:28.761 --> 31:31.388
I know what this is -
this is some sick revenge

31:31.555 --> 31:33.523
because we weren't supportive
of you and Ethan.

31:33.682 --> 31:35.229
So now you're gonna
teach us a lesson.

31:35.392 --> 31:37.736
Believe it or not, Mom,
this isn't about you!

31:37.894 --> 31:40.317
And now that you mention it,
you're the one who told me

31:40.480 --> 31:42.824
that I should find myself a man
and not a boy.

31:44.150 --> 31:46.151
Oh, God!
Paige is leaving!

31:46.319 --> 31:48.071
I bet you didn't
think about her for a second.

31:48.238 --> 31:49.955
I wasn't thinking
about any of you.

31:50.115 --> 31:52.367
- Like I said, it just happened!
- Where are you going?

31:52.534 --> 31:54.251
- Across the street.
- No, you're not.

31:54.410 --> 31:57.289
Nina, get back here. Nina!
Terry, do something.

32:15.179 --> 32:16.931
Hi.

32:18.683 --> 32:20.525
Hey.

32:22.311 --> 32:24.735
I'm sorry.

32:24.897 --> 32:26.445
Don't be.

32:36.158 --> 32:38.251
What did you say
to your mother?

32:39.870 --> 32:41.371
I told her I liked you.

32:41.538 --> 32:44.587
Alright, well,
it's time to kill myself.

32:44.749 --> 32:46.672
- Somebody shoot me.
- Vanessa.

32:46.834 --> 32:49.758
No. You know what?
Don't even try to explain this.

32:49.921 --> 32:51.468
And you, well...

32:51.631 --> 32:53.803
I thought the Peter Fortunato
hand job was bad.

32:53.966 --> 32:56.139
Would you fuck off?

32:56.302 --> 32:58.099
I'll fuck off
when you blow me, slut.

32:58.262 --> 33:00.980
Oh, great.

33:03.391 --> 33:05.735
Look, Van, this has
nothing to do with you.

33:05.895 --> 33:08.443
What do you mean,
it has nothing to do with me?

33:10.148 --> 33:12.276
Oh, man, Terry.

33:12.442 --> 33:14.035
I am so sorry.

33:14.194 --> 33:15.695
Ooh!

33:15.862 --> 33:18.786
- Whoa!
- Ow! Ouch!

33:18.948 --> 33:20.542
- Dad!
- OK, I hurt my ankle. Ow.

33:20.699 --> 33:23.623
- You OK?
- No, I'm not OK. Ow.

33:23.787 --> 33:26.414
Old cow eating young grass.

33:26.580 --> 33:28.173
Uh, that's a saying
when older man

33:28.332 --> 33:30.129
go with
a much younger woman.

33:30.292 --> 33:33.171
Man, you Asian people
have the best expressions.

33:33.337 --> 33:37.262
Don't worry, Vanessa.
Usually, it doesn't last.

33:37.423 --> 33:39.267
At first,
I thought Henry was right,

33:39.425 --> 33:42.099
as the old cow
clearly had regrets.

33:42.261 --> 33:44.980
But it wasn't so simple.

33:46.307 --> 33:48.230
My mother packed her things
and moved into

33:48.392 --> 33:49.770
the only B & B in town...

33:49.936 --> 33:51.813
Well, there's no other guests
at the moment,

33:51.979 --> 33:53.357
so you can
take your pick

33:53.523 --> 33:55.274
of any one of
the 10 rooms we have.

33:55.440 --> 33:58.740
...and was determined to make
my dad pay for what he had done.

33:58.902 --> 34:01.155
I'll take all of them.

34:01.321 --> 34:04.825
My dad, left on his own,
moped for days

34:04.991 --> 34:07.915
and endlessly checked to see
if my mom wanted to talk.

34:08.078 --> 34:10.126
She didn't.

34:10.286 --> 34:13.166
When I dated Andrew Hester,
he was 28.

34:13.331 --> 34:15.505
And I learned so much
from him.

34:15.668 --> 34:17.090
Meanwhile,
the young grass moved in

34:17.253 --> 34:19.597
with her deep-thinking friend,
Meredith Lovett...

34:19.755 --> 34:22.224
They're older. They're just better
at everything, right?

34:22.382 --> 34:25.136
...and sat there hoping
that my dad might call.

34:25.301 --> 34:26.929
He didn't.

34:28.638 --> 34:30.391
He kept trying
to call Terry, but...

34:30.558 --> 34:32.400
...Terry wasn't ready to talk.

34:35.812 --> 34:39.362
They hadn't gone
for a morning jog in weeks.

34:39.524 --> 34:42.744
Nina was now responsible
for breaking up two couples.

34:44.987 --> 34:46.909
Cathy visited my mother
every day

34:47.072 --> 34:48.619
and, in an attempt
to relieve her guilt

34:48.782 --> 34:50.250
over what
her daughter had done,

34:50.409 --> 34:51.786
brought kettle corn.

34:51.952 --> 34:53.420
Lots of it.

34:53.579 --> 34:55.502
Probably 'cause there isn't
a Hallmark card that says,

34:55.664 --> 34:57.792
"Sony my daughter
tried to bang your husband."

34:59.668 --> 35:03.889
And as for me,
I was stuck between my mother,

35:04.047 --> 35:06.721
who continued to bury
her feelings in holiday cheer...

35:06.884 --> 35:10.012
- That's very lovely, Paige.
- The middle range needs tuning.

35:10.179 --> 35:12.727
I'm on it.

35:12.889 --> 35:16.143
...and my dad, who started acting
like everything was OK.

35:16.309 --> 35:17.686
Look good here, right?

35:17.852 --> 35:20.605
Which was harder to take
than the moping.

35:24.232 --> 35:26.326
So does this mean
you're done avoiding me?

35:26.486 --> 35:31.536
I was not avoiding you. I...
I needed time to think.

35:31.698 --> 35:34.793
And I want to make sure that
everything's OK between us.

35:37.412 --> 35:39.460
Are you
breaking up with me?

35:39.623 --> 35:42.627
Because I didn't know
we were together.

35:45.336 --> 35:50.137
I just think that we should just
keep away from each other.

35:50.299 --> 35:52.347
I think that would be best
for everyone now.

35:54.552 --> 35:56.271
OK.

35:58.306 --> 36:00.150
Yeah. Fine.

36:00.308 --> 36:02.107
If that's what you want.

36:02.268 --> 36:04.111
OK.

36:04.270 --> 36:06.022
So we're good.

36:06.189 --> 36:07.566
Yeah.

36:07.732 --> 36:09.530
Old friends.

36:14.656 --> 36:17.580
OK, so, what do you
want me to do?

36:17.741 --> 36:20.961
You want me to go? Or...
I could stay. Or...

36:22.122 --> 36:24.465
You can do whatever you want.
You can go, you can stay.

36:24.623 --> 36:26.876
Oh, my God. Can you stop?

36:27.042 --> 36:30.170
I don't even recognise you.
Can't we just be normal?

36:30.337 --> 36:31.758
What's normal'?

36:31.922 --> 36:33.720
My wife has left me.

36:33.881 --> 36:35.975
I betrayed
everyone I care about.

36:36.135 --> 36:37.681
I don't do this.

36:37.845 --> 36:39.767
- I'm not that guy.
- OK. OK. Look.

36:39.929 --> 36:41.556
I'm willing to go along

36:41.722 --> 36:43.269
with whatever
you want here, David.

36:43.431 --> 36:45.025
Honestly.

36:45.184 --> 36:46.811
But...

36:46.978 --> 36:49.447
Let me ask you
one question.

36:51.606 --> 36:53.358
Are you happy?

36:57.864 --> 37:00.036
It's not about being happy.

37:03.450 --> 37:07.126
If you could lean across
this table right now

37:07.289 --> 37:09.508
and kiss me...

37:10.584 --> 37:13.052
...and no-one would say
it was wrong

37:13.210 --> 37:15.087
and there were no rules...

37:16.714 --> 37:18.637
...would you do it?

37:21.260 --> 37:23.512
That's a stupid question.
I'm not gonna answer that.

37:23.679 --> 37:25.225
Would you do it?

37:25.388 --> 37:29.814
What, if there were no rules? Yeah.
Sure, I would.

37:32.020 --> 37:34.148
There are no rules.

37:34.314 --> 37:38.410
# Deck the halls,
deck the halls, deck the halls

37:38.568 --> 37:40.741
# Deck the halls
with boughs of holly

37:40.904 --> 37:43.077
# Fa-la-la-la-la,
la-la-la-la

37:43.238 --> 37:45.742
# For 'tis the season
to be jolly

37:45.909 --> 37:48.082
# Fa-la-la-la-la,
la-la-la-la

37:48.243 --> 37:50.917
# Don we now our gay apparel

37:51.079 --> 37:53.253
# Fa-la-la-la-la,
la-la-la-la

37:53.415 --> 37:56.008
# Troll the ancient
yuletide carol

37:56.168 --> 37:58.886
# Fa-la-la-la-la,
la-la-la-la

37:59.046 --> 38:01.799
# Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la

38:01.964 --> 38:10.896
# La-la. #

38:13.142 --> 38:15.816
Very good.
Very good, people.

38:15.977 --> 38:18.572
Let's remember
to watch the pace.

38:18.730 --> 38:20.732
Christmas is three weeks away.

38:20.899 --> 38:22.947
I know there have been
requests

38:23.110 --> 38:26.033
to start the Christmas Eve
walk-and-sing earlier.

38:26.196 --> 38:28.574
If we get going by 4:00,
then we will still have time

38:28.740 --> 38:30.208
to make Christmas dinner.

38:30.367 --> 38:32.369
That's great, Diane,
but it's not dark out at 4:00,

38:32.535 --> 38:34.958
and if it's not dark out, then
the candles are pretty useless.

38:35.121 --> 38:36.794
- Right?
- Uh, my parents are coming.

38:36.957 --> 38:38.879
I need to start
at least by 5:00.

38:39.041 --> 38:42.341
We always sing at 6:00!
Every year.

38:42.503 --> 38:45.006
We can't just change things
because you feel like it.

38:45.172 --> 38:47.641
Or you feel like it,
or you feel like it.

38:47.800 --> 38:49.894
Some things
need to stay the same.

38:52.346 --> 38:54.724
Now, if this little
bitch session is over,

38:54.889 --> 38:57.017
I would like to move on
to the 'Tannenbaum' medley.

39:01.813 --> 39:05.943
We have got...51 hours before
I have to be back at work.

39:14.658 --> 39:17.958
Atlantic City -
where New Jersey comes to hide.

39:18.120 --> 39:20.293
Are you prepared?

39:24.084 --> 39:27.212
Give me a dollar, yo.

39:27.379 --> 39:29.506
# ..for more time
than I saw

39:30.673 --> 39:33.096
# It seems so small

39:34.635 --> 39:39.391
# The tide swept inside of me
almost entirely

39:39.557 --> 39:44.734
# All that I thought was a constant
had floated away... #

39:44.895 --> 39:46.238
Yeah!

39:46.397 --> 39:48.115
# So I just stay

39:50.525 --> 39:55.497
# Will you wait for me? #

39:58.366 --> 40:03.121
# We'll just wait and see

40:05.457 --> 40:08.710
# The moon on the water
is carried to the land

40:08.876 --> 40:14.725
# As the seagulls were silent,
I heard what you said so clear

40:14.882 --> 40:18.477
# We can't stay here

40:19.887 --> 40:22.185
# So clear

40:22.348 --> 40:25.443
# We can't stay here

40:27.560 --> 40:29.654
# Stay clear

40:30.730 --> 40:33.483
# We can't stay here. #

40:38.946 --> 40:40.447
It's pouring with rain

40:40.615 --> 40:42.616
and the mud and rocks
are flying down the trail,

40:42.784 --> 40:47.289
and I really wanted to push on,
but this ranger said

40:47.454 --> 40:49.832
that he'd arrest us both
if we didn't go right back down.

40:49.998 --> 40:53.878
Which sucks, 'cause...
we were only three peaks short.

40:54.044 --> 40:57.093
Wait, so,
if you climb all 46 peaks,

40:57.255 --> 40:59.724
what does that mean -
you get a prize, or...?

40:59.882 --> 41:01.385
No. You do not
get a prize.

41:01.551 --> 41:03.553
But you'd get to
call yourself a 46er.

41:03.719 --> 41:06.018
Which, in some circles,
is pretty spectacular.

41:06.180 --> 41:07.603
- Sounds...
- David!

41:07.765 --> 41:10.735
Hey. How's it going, buddy?

41:10.893 --> 41:12.566
- Hey.
- You remember Anne?

41:12.727 --> 41:14.401
- Anne, sure. Hi. Yes.
- Hi, David.

41:16.273 --> 41:19.116
Uh, Nina, this is, uh,
Gideon Allen, who I work with,

41:19.276 --> 41:20.152
and Anne.

41:20.318 --> 41:21.410
Hi.

41:22.821 --> 41:26.701
- Nice to meet you.
- Nina and I are, uh...

41:30.412 --> 41:33.130
We're old friends.

41:33.289 --> 41:35.542
It's nice
to meet you, Nina.

41:37.334 --> 41:39.177
So, uh...

41:39.336 --> 41:41.259
You guys come here a lot?

41:41.422 --> 41:42.924
Few times a year.

41:43.090 --> 41:46.060
Uh, Anne's actually
a fantastic poker player.

41:47.553 --> 41:50.022
Do you guys
want to join us?

41:50.180 --> 41:51.648
- Um...
- You know what?

41:51.806 --> 41:53.775
There's a stud tournament
starting in a couple of minutes.

41:53.933 --> 41:55.935
- So...
- You didn't come here to eat?

41:57.812 --> 42:00.281
No - we're just
checking out the menu,

42:00.440 --> 42:03.990
for when we eat later.

42:04.152 --> 42:07.655
Well, if we're still here,
you can join us then.

42:08.906 --> 42:10.532
Yeah.
Nice to meet you.

42:12.117 --> 42:13.961
- See you later maybe.
- That would be great.

42:14.119 --> 42:16.963
- Yeah.
-'Bye. Nice to meet you.

42:18.499 --> 42:21.342
That was Gideon and Anne.

42:31.844 --> 42:33.972
Hey. There she is.

42:36.515 --> 42:38.893
You back from your
"need to think" vision quest?

42:39.059 --> 42:43.438
Yeah. Took a ride out to the beach.
Really cleared my head.

42:45.107 --> 42:46.983
Where'd you stay?

42:48.944 --> 42:51.993
Uh, I stayed at
a bed-and-breakfast.

42:52.155 --> 42:55.500
It's really nice
in the winter. The air.

42:58.161 --> 43:00.414
I'm gonna make some coffee.
You want some?

43:00.579 --> 43:03.924
I don't drink coffee.

43:07.962 --> 43:09.338
What...

43:09.505 --> 43:11.633
What if you and I
took a trip,

43:11.798 --> 43:13.641
out to where I was,
near Point Pleasant?

43:13.800 --> 43:16.473
- You used to love it there.
- Just the two of us? Together?

43:16.637 --> 43:19.561
Yeah. Just like we used to.

43:19.723 --> 43:22.897
Be great.
There's nobody around. It's...

43:24.853 --> 43:27.446
Yeah. Sure. Maybe.

43:27.605 --> 43:29.824
Whatever.

43:53.880 --> 43:56.303
We just didn't want
to lie to you anymore.

43:56.466 --> 43:58.138
Oh, thank you.

43:58.301 --> 44:00.645
Thank you both for showing
such good judgment.

44:00.803 --> 44:03.682
- Um... I'm gonna go home.
- Vanessa, please stay.

44:03.847 --> 44:05.440
No, let her go.
She'll never understand.

44:05.599 --> 44:06.976
Never understand what?

44:07.142 --> 44:09.691
What, that you have to go
from man to man

44:09.853 --> 44:11.651
to validate
your pathetic existence?

44:11.813 --> 44:14.442
Terry, you want to go?
You and me? Make out in the back?

44:14.608 --> 44:16.076
Huh? Right now. Let's go.
Let's do it.

44:16.234 --> 44:18.202
- Vanessa!
- David!

44:18.361 --> 44:23.333
You told me that this situation
with my daughter was finished.

44:23.491 --> 44:26.244
It was over.
Terry, it was.

44:26.411 --> 44:29.039
Look, we both realise
that this is wrong.

44:29.205 --> 44:30.707
Oh, you think?

44:30.873 --> 44:32.590
And, yeah, I know,
it's selfish, and it's...

44:32.750 --> 44:34.342
...it's, uh...

44:35.920 --> 44:37.592
It's unacceptable. OK.

44:39.382 --> 44:42.260
But if it makes us happy,
why do we have to stop it?

44:42.426 --> 44:45.305
I don't want to stop.
I don't want to stop.

44:45.470 --> 44:48.848
I want to be happy.

44:59.775 --> 45:01.903
What do you plan on doing?

45:02.069 --> 45:04.492
Are you going
to stay in New Jersey?

45:06.240 --> 45:07.866
I'll get a job
in a restaurant.

45:08.033 --> 45:10.412
I've already called Shelly.
He said he could use the help.

45:10.577 --> 45:12.420
Shelly's restaurant
is serious.

45:12.579 --> 45:15.924
I'm serious. I've worked in
a serious restaurant before.

45:16.082 --> 45:19.427
So, if you want us
to take you seriously,

45:19.586 --> 45:21.133
then let me ask you
a few questions.

45:21.295 --> 45:23.343
OK.

45:24.841 --> 45:27.218
Would you say that
the connection you're feeling

45:27.385 --> 45:29.978
is genuine,
that what you have is real?

45:30.138 --> 45:31.514
- Yes.
- Yes.

45:31.680 --> 45:33.057
Absolutely.

45:33.223 --> 45:34.691
Now, we're all aware

45:34.850 --> 45:36.443
there's a significant
age difference here.

45:36.602 --> 45:39.481
If what we're feeling
is real, and genuine,

45:39.647 --> 45:41.615
then age doesn't matter.

45:41.773 --> 45:45.574
I guess, then, what
I'm asking is, Nina, honey...

45:47.154 --> 45:49.872
...are you OK
sucking David's old balls?

45:50.032 --> 45:51.658
- Cathy!
- Oh, my God.

45:51.824 --> 45:54.168
- Cathy.
- It's a legitimate question.

45:54.327 --> 45:56.079
His balls are much older
than her.

45:56.245 --> 45:58.589
- Vanessa!
- You are being such an asshole.

45:58.748 --> 46:01.092
Do not call your mother
an a-hole in this house!

46:01.250 --> 46:02.967
Thank you, Terry! Thank you.

46:03.127 --> 46:05.800
I'm sorry I lied to you.

46:05.962 --> 46:07.509
This is a nightmare.

46:07.673 --> 46:11.098
I mean, I...I understand
you're going through this, like,

46:11.259 --> 46:12.852
pathetic meltdown
or something,

46:13.011 --> 46:15.389
but, like, if you had to
fuck somebody half your age,

46:15.555 --> 46:17.307
did it have to be her?

46:20.060 --> 46:23.405
Oh, and by the way, Dad,
um, what about Mom?

46:31.570 --> 46:32.992
It was right about then

46:33.155 --> 46:35.532
that shit started
to really get weird.

46:35.699 --> 46:38.873
My father started
calling in sick to work a lot.

46:45.250 --> 46:49.096
Gadgets McGee was unnerved
to see Nina with my dad.

46:50.922 --> 46:54.142
But he was also struck
by how alive his friend seemed.

46:55.551 --> 46:59.055
Inspired to recapture
his own lost youth, or something,

46:59.222 --> 47:01.599
he went online and found
a pick-up ultimate frisbee game

47:01.765 --> 47:03.187
in Paramus.

47:03.350 --> 47:06.524
Hey, guys! You, uh...
you got room for one more?

47:06.686 --> 47:08.860
No daylight. No daylight.

47:09.022 --> 47:14.027
So it was really Jared Kass
and I, and Joel Silver...

47:14.194 --> 47:15.946
Joel Silver,
the movie producer?

47:16.113 --> 47:17.410
Yeah. Yeah.

47:18.532 --> 47:20.078
My mother
had been making herself

47:20.241 --> 47:21.994
mysteriously unavailable.

47:23.202 --> 47:25.500
But, as all our neighbours
discovered...

47:27.164 --> 47:30.464
...she hadn't completely lost sight
of the Christmas spirit.

47:35.881 --> 47:37.350
Terry!

47:37.507 --> 47:39.259
Everything was changing.

47:39.427 --> 47:40.803
Terry!

47:40.969 --> 47:42.642
No-one even recognised
each other anymore.

47:45.598 --> 47:48.477
- Smoothie?
- Oh, good God.

47:51.688 --> 47:53.815
Very good.

47:53.982 --> 47:56.154
Now kiss the chef.

48:08.454 --> 48:10.547
Maybe they are
really in love.

48:10.706 --> 48:12.082
You said it doesn't last.

48:12.248 --> 48:14.626
You said that the grasses only
wanted the cows for their money.

48:14.793 --> 48:16.420
Usually that is the case,
but not always.

48:16.586 --> 48:18.679
- Your dad is pretty cute.
- Don't be gross, OK?

48:18.838 --> 48:20.761
Just because you haven't gotten
laid in, like, three weeks.

48:20.923 --> 48:22.971
Perhaps your problem is
more with Nina than your father.

48:23.134 --> 48:24.976
Oh, is that so, Henry?
Why is that?

48:25.136 --> 48:26.512
Because maybe
you are jealous,

48:26.678 --> 48:30.058
because she has travelled
many places and has lived,

48:30.224 --> 48:33.103
because she takes chances.

48:33.268 --> 48:34.646
No. You know what?

48:34.812 --> 48:36.405
You, my friend,
have breathed in

48:36.563 --> 48:38.486
a little too much
of this cheap pine wax, OK?

48:38.648 --> 48:41.653
'Cause she's a selfish skank.
And he's selfish too.

48:41.818 --> 48:44.197
Yeah, but if he
really is happier with her

48:44.363 --> 48:45.785
and you make him stop,

48:45.947 --> 48:47.574
then you're the one
who's being selfish.

48:49.493 --> 48:51.244
That is maybe
the most intelligent thing

48:51.410 --> 48:52.912
you have ever said.

49:09.219 --> 49:11.062
Hey.

49:11.221 --> 49:14.190
What is
Barnyard International?

49:14.349 --> 49:17.478
Well, um... See those presents
you got at babyGap?

49:17.644 --> 49:19.863
Instead of giving those
to a baby

49:20.020 --> 49:21.648
who might already
have lots of clothes,

49:21.815 --> 49:23.817
why not help a baby
who doesn't have any food?

49:23.984 --> 49:25.360
They're not for a baby.

49:25.526 --> 49:27.028
They're for my husband's
new girlfriend.

49:29.238 --> 49:30.785
Here's some pamphlets.

49:33.325 --> 49:35.874
"One goat
can provide a family

49:36.035 --> 49:38.254
"with enough milk
for an entire year."

49:40.124 --> 49:42.343
It's like the Christmas gift
that keeps giving.

49:42.500 --> 49:44.127
Yeah. It is.

49:44.294 --> 49:46.296
That's good. Can I use that?

49:46.462 --> 49:49.011
Sure.

49:56.681 --> 49:59.024
Oh, yes! Oh! Oh!

50:07.065 --> 50:10.193
There are gift receipts inside,
if anyone wants to return them.

50:13.989 --> 50:15.786
I think after Christmas Eve,

50:15.948 --> 50:18.498
we should demand
that Paige have dinner with us.

50:21.579 --> 50:23.330
What are you doing?

50:23.497 --> 50:25.215
Come here.

50:27.460 --> 50:29.962
- I have toothpaste in my mouth.
- I don't care.

50:35.383 --> 50:37.181
Come here.

50:48.313 --> 50:51.487
OK. Thank you
for dropping me off.

50:51.650 --> 50:53.778
I got you these.

50:59.073 --> 51:00.949
Chef's clogs.

51:01.116 --> 51:03.084
You said after working last night,
your feet hurt, so...

51:03.242 --> 51:04.994
You're so sweet.

51:14.003 --> 51:15.926
OK. You're gonna
make me late.

51:16.089 --> 51:17.965
Whoo!

51:28.141 --> 51:29.518
- That was fast.
- Yeah.

51:29.686 --> 51:31.938
Um...

51:32.104 --> 51:33.651
What?

51:35.899 --> 51:37.275
Nothing.

51:37.441 --> 51:38.819
What's up?

51:38.986 --> 51:40.363
Nothing.

51:40.529 --> 51:42.201
Come on.
Tell me what's wrong.

51:44.198 --> 51:46.576
- I...
- I love you, Nina.

51:48.619 --> 51:52.249
You shit. You suck.
I wanted to say it first.

51:54.083 --> 51:56.962
Well, now I'm not saying it.
You blew it, buddy.

51:59.045 --> 52:01.343
I'm just kidding.
I love you too.

52:06.469 --> 52:09.222
You guys were married
for 28 years.

52:09.389 --> 52:11.733
If anyone should call,
it should be him.

52:11.890 --> 52:14.019
- Do you have any perfume?
- No.

52:14.184 --> 52:16.984
What?! Where are you
even going?

52:17.147 --> 52:19.649
Well, I read about
a late-evening cabaret show

52:19.815 --> 52:21.362
that begins at 9:30.

52:21.525 --> 52:23.869
- I'm taking myself out.
- Cabaret?

52:24.029 --> 52:26.247
Am I the only one
who's dealing with this?

52:26.405 --> 52:30.160
I mean, don't you
want to come back home?

52:32.201 --> 52:33.704
I'm not sure.

52:33.871 --> 52:36.498
I'm having a good time
for once.

52:36.664 --> 52:40.760
I'd like to see you
do the same.

52:44.505 --> 52:46.098
Let's go, guys!
Pick up the pace!

52:46.257 --> 52:48.009
Hey, Mondo!
Where's my rigatoni? Let's go!

52:48.176 --> 52:49.723
Bring it up, parmigiana.

52:49.886 --> 52:51.763
Nina! Plate 27!

52:51.928 --> 52:53.351
Alright, guys-

52:53.513 --> 52:55.937
On 24, I got a mahi mahi
and a chicken parmigiana.

52:56.099 --> 52:58.067
Thanks for sending her to me.
She's a good worker.

52:58.226 --> 52:59.695
- Well, that's great.
- Chef likes her.

52:59.853 --> 53:03.153
Haven't seen you and Paige
for a while. It's good to see you.

53:03.315 --> 53:05.864
- Enjoy.
- Thanks.

53:36.012 --> 53:39.061
- Done with your appetiser, sir?
- Sorry?

53:39.224 --> 53:40.817
Done with
your appetiser, sir?

53:40.974 --> 53:43.022
Yeah. That... Yeah.
That's great. Thanks.

53:47.941 --> 53:49.533
Hello.

53:50.901 --> 53:52.494
Hi, Paige.

53:54.571 --> 53:57.165
Nice move
on the Christmas card.

53:57.324 --> 53:59.042
Thank you.

54:00.119 --> 54:03.373
- Dining alone?
- Uh, yeah. I guess.

54:04.747 --> 54:06.670
So how are you doing?
Is everything...

54:06.834 --> 54:08.711
Sit down. Don't have to
make this uncomfortable.

54:08.876 --> 54:10.423
Just...

54:13.172 --> 54:15.516
Plus, you know
how I hate pleasantries.

54:17.093 --> 54:19.266
What about you?

54:19.428 --> 54:21.521
You look happy.

54:22.974 --> 54:24.600
Things are OK.
You know, I'm...

54:24.766 --> 54:27.316
If you're happy,
you can say so.

54:27.477 --> 54:29.320
You don't need
to spare my feelings.

54:29.479 --> 54:33.529
Just...be genuine,
David, please.

54:33.692 --> 54:35.364
Please.

54:37.863 --> 54:40.115
Yes. I'm happy-

54:43.659 --> 54:45.286
Thank you.

54:45.453 --> 54:47.079
Yeah.

54:48.539 --> 54:50.541
Look, I know
there's nothing I can say...

54:50.708 --> 54:52.176
Then don't try.

54:52.334 --> 54:54.210
Paige, stop. Please.

54:54.377 --> 54:56.721
This is exactly
how we got to this.

54:58.174 --> 55:02.804
OK, not exactly.
It's partly.

55:02.969 --> 55:05.939
We stopped talking
to each other.

55:08.391 --> 55:11.065
I used to love who I was
around you.

55:11.226 --> 55:14.071
What happened to us?

55:15.689 --> 55:18.283
We used to have fun.
Remember that?

55:20.319 --> 55:22.948
We used to laugh.
God, you were so funny.

55:23.113 --> 55:24.831
I'm still funny.

55:24.990 --> 55:27.163
I'm... Ask them.

55:50.056 --> 55:51.898
Shelly just fired me!

55:52.058 --> 55:53.650
Hey, hey.

55:53.809 --> 55:57.278
- What happened?
- Oh! This is fucking bullshit!

55:57.437 --> 56:00.111
- What? Why?
- Because he's not an idiot.

56:00.273 --> 56:03.151
He saw you and Paige, and he
saw me, and he figured it out.

56:03.318 --> 56:05.740
He said he didn't want
to be in the middle of it.

56:05.904 --> 56:07.998
And I was good at that job!

56:08.155 --> 56:10.203
Why...

56:10.367 --> 56:12.744
Why were you talking to her?

56:12.910 --> 56:14.662
She came into the restaurant.

56:14.828 --> 56:17.707
What do you expect me to do?

56:17.873 --> 56:20.296
I saw you sitting with her,
and I just thought...

56:22.962 --> 56:24.338
Thought what?

56:24.505 --> 56:26.348
I don't know.

56:28.925 --> 56:30.894
You looked normal together.

56:38.434 --> 56:41.153
Can we please get out of here?

56:49.569 --> 56:50.991
# I really can't stay

56:51.154 --> 56:53.031
# But, baby,
it's cold outside

56:53.198 --> 56:56.201
- # I've got to go away
- # But, baby, it's cold outside

56:56.368 --> 56:58.041
# This evening has been...

56:58.202 --> 56:59.796
# Been hoping
that you drop in

56:59.954 --> 57:01.376
# So very nice

57:01.539 --> 57:04.713
# I'll hold your hands
They're just like ice

57:04.876 --> 57:06.753
# My mother
will start to worry... I

57:06.919 --> 57:08.762
Hi. Mrs Ostroff'?

57:08.921 --> 57:10.639
We've never met.

57:10.798 --> 57:13.017
But I'm Ethan.

57:18.014 --> 57:19.812
You're our leader.
You can't quit!

57:19.973 --> 57:23.353
Christmas Eve is in, like,
six days. They're counting on us.

57:23.518 --> 57:27.864
Try and calm down. Calm down.

57:28.023 --> 57:31.027
Calm down. Order!

57:31.192 --> 57:33.159
I know you're upset.

57:33.320 --> 57:37.040
But you're all
dedicated and talented singers.

57:38.574 --> 57:39.952
Marcus will take over
as leader.

57:40.117 --> 57:42.541
- What?!
- Marcus?

57:42.703 --> 57:44.751
- Why are you even doing this?
- Yeah.

57:44.913 --> 57:48.712
Well, I believe these pamphlets
should explain everything.

57:48.876 --> 57:51.675
Each cow or goat
will allow its recipient

57:51.836 --> 57:54.556
independence
and self-sufficiency

57:54.714 --> 57:57.093
for years to come.

57:58.134 --> 58:00.432
And that's pretty great,
isn't it?

58:01.805 --> 58:04.774
Shelly, this has
nothing to do with you.

58:04.932 --> 58:06.855
No, I know it's complicated.

58:07.018 --> 58:09.191
No. I understand.

58:10.688 --> 58:12.531
Thanks for calling back.

58:15.484 --> 58:16.861
Told you.

58:17.027 --> 58:18.825
He'll write you
a reference, but...

58:18.988 --> 58:20.660
Yeah. He doesn't
want to get involved.

58:20.822 --> 58:24.452
This isn't gonna work.
I need to find another job.

58:24.618 --> 58:26.370
I can't stay at Meredith's
rent-free.

58:26.536 --> 58:27.913
I know.

58:28.080 --> 58:29.456
And I can't stay here,

58:29.622 --> 58:31.090
across the street
from my parents.

58:31.249 --> 58:34.128
- I love you. But...
- What the fuck?

58:34.294 --> 58:37.843
- Ethan?
- What the hell is going on?

58:38.006 --> 58:41.225
- What are you doing here?
- Ethan? Like, Ethan Ethan?

58:41.384 --> 58:44.388
- How did you get in here?
- Your mom gave me the keys.

58:44.553 --> 58:46.271
She told me
to let myself in,

58:46.430 --> 58:48.023
like you might not
hear the bell.

58:48.181 --> 58:50.809
Look, Ethan, I'm sorry, but I'm
gonna have to ask you to leave.

58:50.976 --> 58:54.525
You can ask, but I'm not gonna.
Who is this?

58:54.687 --> 58:56.656
Ethan, this is David -
David and Paige,

58:56.815 --> 58:58.863
my parents' best friends
from across the street.

59:00.151 --> 59:01.777
Why are you telling
your parents' friend

59:01.945 --> 59:03.322
that you love him?

59:03.487 --> 59:05.831
The door's open.
What's going on?

59:05.990 --> 59:08.334
Nina, I need to talk to you.

59:08.492 --> 59:10.665
Can we go somewhere
for, like, five minutes?

59:10.828 --> 59:12.580
Ethan!
I think you should leave.

59:12.747 --> 59:15.716
- Ethan Ethan?
- Yes! Just five minutes!

59:15.874 --> 59:17.876
She said no, Ethan.

59:18.043 --> 59:20.387
I'm gonna ask you one more time
to get out of here.

59:20.546 --> 59:25.393
And if I don't, Pops,
what are you gonna do about it?

59:25.550 --> 59:26.551
Arggh!

59:26.717 --> 59:28.185
'Dad!
Hey!

59:28.345 --> 59:29.220
- David!
- Dad!

59:29.387 --> 59:31.060
Get off me!

59:32.557 --> 59:34.901
# Your eyes
are like starlight now

59:35.059 --> 59:36.652
# To break this spell

59:36.810 --> 59:39.814
# I'll take your hat
Your hair looks swell... #

59:39.980 --> 59:41.857
Why don't you go fuck...

59:42.024 --> 59:44.867
- What?
- Nothing.

59:45.026 --> 59:46.699
Its OK.

59:49.489 --> 59:53.869
# Baby,
it's cold outside. #

01:00:04.212 --> 01:00:08.308
Yes, I cheated on you.
And for that, I am deeply sorry.

01:00:08.466 --> 01:00:11.686
But here's the thing.
I'm a sabotager.

01:00:11.843 --> 01:00:15.598
See, any time
anything good happens to me,

01:00:15.764 --> 01:00:17.687
I...I...I just try
and ruin it, you know,

01:00:17.849 --> 01:00:19.476
because I get scared.

01:00:19.643 --> 01:00:23.488
Now, things with us
were really...real.

01:00:23.646 --> 01:00:26.365
But I didn't feel like
I deserved you,

01:00:26.524 --> 01:00:30.279
so I became the sabotager
and, like, destroyed it.

01:00:30.444 --> 01:00:32.492
That's great, Ethan.

01:00:32.655 --> 01:00:34.828
But we can't just go on
and pretend like everything's fine

01:00:34.991 --> 01:00:36.584
because you learned
a new term about yourself.

01:00:36.742 --> 01:00:40.464
And I don't even think
'sabotager' is a word.

01:00:40.621 --> 01:00:42.589
OK. Please allow me
to finish.

01:00:42.748 --> 01:00:45.922
See, I think
you're a sabotager also.

01:00:46.084 --> 01:00:49.258
You totally pushed for us
to get married so you could, like,

01:00:49.421 --> 01:00:51.719
prove to your parents
that, you know,

01:00:51.881 --> 01:00:53.350
you were
this responsible person.

01:00:53.508 --> 01:00:57.513
But simultaneously, you were
just trying to piss them off

01:00:57.678 --> 01:00:59.680
by marrying someone like me.

01:00:59.847 --> 01:01:01.440
I've moved on.

01:01:01.600 --> 01:01:04.022
- OK? David and I...
- David and you...

01:01:04.185 --> 01:01:08.736
He's your parents' best friend.
For Christ's sakes.

01:01:08.897 --> 01:01:12.152
I mean, what... Are you gonna move
here to New Jersey?

01:01:12.318 --> 01:01:14.662
You hate it here.

01:01:16.863 --> 01:01:18.240
We're done.

01:01:18.406 --> 01:01:20.625
OK? Go home.

01:01:20.784 --> 01:01:22.377
I only bought
a one-way ticket.

01:01:25.539 --> 01:01:27.633
Well, I'm not giving up
on us, Nina!

01:01:27.790 --> 01:01:30.169
I love you too much
for that!

01:01:33.046 --> 01:01:35.298
What?

01:02:02.907 --> 01:02:04.533
What are you doing
with my bag?

01:02:04.700 --> 01:02:06.794
Huh? Nothing.
Just getting it some air.

01:02:09.121 --> 01:02:11.375
- Give me my bag.
- No.

01:02:11.540 --> 01:02:13.838
Give me my bag!

01:02:14.001 --> 01:02:17.300
- Eat me, dick slut.
- Give me my bag, Vanessa!

01:02:17.462 --> 01:02:19.008
No, Nina!

01:02:19.172 --> 01:02:21.174
- No!
- Give me my bag!

01:02:21.341 --> 01:02:24.844
- No! No!
- Give it to me!

01:02:25.011 --> 01:02:26.389
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Give it!

01:02:26.554 --> 01:02:28.101
Oh!

01:03:04.673 --> 01:03:06.596
Oh, honey. Uh...

01:03:06.759 --> 01:03:08.511
Honey?

01:03:08.677 --> 01:03:10.679
I'm sorry, Dad.

01:03:10.846 --> 01:03:12.723
Uh...

01:03:18.519 --> 01:03:20.772
Oh...

01:03:34.327 --> 01:03:37.250
Uh, you know, leave it be.
It's a...it's a badge of honour.

01:03:37.412 --> 01:03:38.915
- You sure?
- Yeah.

01:03:39.081 --> 01:03:41.004
There's aloe on the pad
to prevent scarring.

01:03:41.166 --> 01:03:42.713
OK. Um...

01:03:42.876 --> 01:03:48.474
You know, I'm good.
I'm, uh...I'm good.

01:03:50.549 --> 01:03:53.018
I'm so sorry about
all this horrible...

01:03:54.471 --> 01:03:56.063
...stuff.

01:03:57.390 --> 01:03:58.984
I'm just...

01:04:00.393 --> 01:04:02.316
Yeah.

01:04:05.731 --> 01:04:09.577
You know,
my parents were kinda weird.

01:04:09.735 --> 01:04:12.659
That's why I'm, um...

01:04:14.073 --> 01:04:18.873
Sometimes it's really hard
to say everything you want to.

01:04:19.035 --> 01:04:20.662
You know...

01:04:22.205 --> 01:04:26.801
Your father, he loves you.

01:04:28.044 --> 01:04:31.172
Just don't let that
get confused

01:04:31.338 --> 01:04:33.682
with everything
that's happening.

01:04:38.011 --> 01:04:39.432
Life.

01:04:39.596 --> 01:04:40.973
Ooph!

01:04:41.139 --> 01:04:42.733
Stuff.

01:04:46.520 --> 01:04:49.273
...Pasquerella, this is Greg
from Barnyard International.

01:04:49.439 --> 01:04:50.908
I'm wondering
if I could interest you

01:04:51.065 --> 01:04:52.568
in sponsoring a goat.

01:04:52.734 --> 01:04:54.156
Funding for Barnyard International...

01:04:54.318 --> 01:04:58.447
Well, thank you very much,
Mr lngber, and, uh...I...

01:04:58.614 --> 01:05:01.742
...and I'm sure the people
of Komanesk, Ukraine,

01:05:01.908 --> 01:05:04.206
who will be receiving the chickens,
thank you as well.

01:05:04.369 --> 01:05:08.090
- Merry Christmas. 'Bye.
- Great job, Paige.

01:05:09.791 --> 01:05:11.635
You're a natural.

01:05:11.793 --> 01:05:13.670
Thank you.

01:05:15.297 --> 01:05:17.173
It'll be a great Christmas.

01:05:35.316 --> 01:05:37.785
Oh, fuck!

01:05:44.574 --> 01:05:47.123
- Are you out of your mind?
- What? I'm not on his lawn.

01:05:47.285 --> 01:05:49.083
I'm in the street.
The street's public property.

01:05:49.245 --> 01:05:51.293
- I told you to go home.
- Yeah.

01:05:51.456 --> 01:05:53.207
And I totally bought
a return ticket.

01:05:53.373 --> 01:05:55.047
But guess what.
I'm not using it.

01:05:55.209 --> 01:05:57.679
I'm not leaving until
you give me another chance.

01:05:57.836 --> 01:06:00.340
Nina, I'm not, which is why
I ripped up that ticket,

01:06:00.506 --> 01:06:01.883
in my mind.

01:06:02.050 --> 01:06:04.051
'Cause it's an e-ticket.

01:06:04.219 --> 01:06:09.098
Look... I've moved on.
I'm with someone else now.

01:06:09.264 --> 01:06:11.561
You need to get over me.

01:06:11.725 --> 01:06:13.602
Yeah, see,
that's, like, the whole thing!

01:06:13.769 --> 01:06:16.113
I don't want
to get over you!

01:06:16.270 --> 01:06:20.571
Nina! Please!

01:06:21.692 --> 01:06:25.663
# Those streetlights
start to fade away

01:06:27.198 --> 01:06:32.420
# I see the quiet on you
when you're sleeping

01:06:32.577 --> 01:06:36.753
# Probably dreaming day

01:06:41.461 --> 01:06:44.214
# We had the perfect... #

01:06:44.381 --> 01:06:46.509
Hey.

01:06:46.675 --> 01:06:48.768
Hi.

01:06:51.595 --> 01:06:53.063
Thanks.

01:06:53.223 --> 01:06:55.600
I'm glad you stopped.

01:07:00.020 --> 01:07:01.397
I've been playing
a lot of ultimate.

01:07:01.564 --> 01:07:04.192
I'm going to play some.

01:07:04.358 --> 01:07:05.985
That's great.

01:07:11.489 --> 01:07:13.662
I miss you, Terry.

01:07:20.832 --> 01:07:22.333
You might want to
find Vanessa.

01:07:22.500 --> 01:07:23.921
Why? What happened?

01:07:24.085 --> 01:07:26.838
You should probably
let her tell you.

01:07:27.005 --> 01:07:29.098
Harry, cut the shit.
What happened?

01:07:39.808 --> 01:07:41.354
Hey.

01:07:49.775 --> 01:07:51.573
This is a mess.

01:07:53.154 --> 01:07:54.701
Uh-huh.

01:07:58.242 --> 01:07:59.789
Look.

01:08:01.996 --> 01:08:04.839
If you want me to end this,
I will.

01:08:07.083 --> 01:08:08.460
I'm serious.

01:08:08.628 --> 01:08:11.927
I know it may not
seem like it lately, but...

01:08:12.088 --> 01:08:15.934
...you are the most important thing
in the world to me.

01:08:22.555 --> 01:08:24.149
I don't know.

01:08:27.019 --> 01:08:28.862
I mean, then what happens?

01:08:34.274 --> 01:08:35.823
You know...

01:08:37.613 --> 01:08:39.330
I don't know.

01:08:53.710 --> 01:08:56.805
# Oh, the weather outside
is frightful

01:08:56.965 --> 01:09:00.434
# But the fire
is so delightful

01:09:00.591 --> 01:09:03.812
# And since we've
no place to go

01:09:03.970 --> 01:09:07.475
# Let it snow,
let it snow, let it snow

01:09:07.640 --> 01:09:10.770
# Man, it doesn't show
signs of stopping... #

01:09:10.935 --> 01:09:12.859
What are you doing, Ethan?

01:09:15.232 --> 01:09:17.825
# The lights are turned
way down low... #

01:09:17.984 --> 01:09:19.862
Paige, I want you
to stop avoiding me.

01:09:20.027 --> 01:09:22.746
Terry and I are spending
Christmas Eve with you.

01:09:22.904 --> 01:09:24.782
This tradition is continuing.

01:09:24.948 --> 01:09:27.702
So get your ass over here
or I'll get really mad.

01:09:27.867 --> 01:09:29.541
OK?

01:09:29.703 --> 01:09:31.376
I love you. 'Bye.

01:09:33.081 --> 01:09:34.799
How was that? Too forceful?

01:09:34.957 --> 01:09:38.383
# Oh, the fire
is slowly dying

01:09:38.545 --> 01:09:40.843
# And, my dear,
we're still goodbye-mg..- #

01:09:41.006 --> 01:09:41.881
Oh, shit.

01:09:42.048 --> 01:09:44.926
# But as long
as you love me so

01:09:45.093 --> 01:09:48.220
# Let it snow,
let it snow

01:09:48.386 --> 01:09:50.981
- Hey. Merry Christmas.
- # Let it snow. #

01:09:51.140 --> 01:09:53.018
Yeah. Same, uh...
same to you.

01:09:53.183 --> 01:09:54.776
David!

01:09:54.935 --> 01:09:57.279
Hello? Anyone home?

01:09:59.940 --> 01:10:01.817
- Hey!
- Hi.

01:10:01.984 --> 01:10:05.033
- Toby.
- Nina. What's going on?

01:10:05.194 --> 01:10:06.663
- Oh.
- Oh...

01:10:06.821 --> 01:10:08.994
I really missed you.
Did you get my postcards?

01:10:09.158 --> 01:10:11.285
- Uh... No.
- No? That's so funny.

01:10:11.451 --> 01:10:12.998
I sent 'em to your...
your mom's house.

01:10:13.161 --> 01:10:15.084
- Is everyone already over here?
- Call that guy...

01:10:16.372 --> 01:10:17.874
- Hey, Toby. You're back.
- Hey.

01:10:18.041 --> 01:10:20.510
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas!

01:10:20.667 --> 01:10:22.386
Merry Christmas.

01:10:25.214 --> 01:10:26.807
What's with
that guy outside?

01:10:29.259 --> 01:10:31.933
How the hell could you not
tell me Mom and Dad split up?

01:10:32.095 --> 01:10:34.097
- How could nobody tell me?
- What could you do?

01:10:34.264 --> 01:10:36.187
You were in China.
How was that, by the way?

01:10:36.349 --> 01:10:37.942
Just get your ass
over here.

01:10:38.100 --> 01:10:40.354
You're not leaving me
alone with them.

01:10:40.519 --> 01:10:42.363
Look, I can't, OK?
I'm at work.

01:10:42.521 --> 01:10:45.024
And where the hell is Mom'?

01:10:45.191 --> 01:10:46.784
Merry Christmas.

01:10:51.697 --> 01:10:54.576
'Bye.
Say hi to your family.

01:11:02.500 --> 01:11:04.172
Putting aside the enormous

01:11:04.334 --> 01:11:06.177
and nauseating age difference
between you two,

01:11:06.336 --> 01:11:08.088
you do realise
that I've kissed her twice?

01:11:08.254 --> 01:11:11.053
No, once.
We never kissed on Thanksgiving.

01:11:11.216 --> 01:11:12.843
Oh, well,
everything is fine, then.

01:11:13.008 --> 01:11:15.056
Toby, come on. Uh, look.
I know you're upset.

01:11:15.220 --> 01:11:16.596
- But try to understand.
- Understand what?

01:11:16.762 --> 01:11:18.265
That I am the first son
in history

01:11:18.430 --> 01:11:19.932
to be cock-blocked
by his father?

01:11:20.100 --> 01:11:21.601
Oh, good.
I haven't missed anything.

01:11:21.767 --> 01:11:24.111
Toby. Toby!

01:11:35.572 --> 01:11:37.119
Excuse me.

01:11:38.366 --> 01:11:40.084
Merry Christmas.

01:11:40.243 --> 01:11:42.712
- What are you doing?
- Oh.

01:11:42.871 --> 01:11:46.249
My ex-girlfriend
is inside that house there.

01:11:46.415 --> 01:11:49.009
I'm trying to win her back.

01:11:49.167 --> 01:11:53.092
You must love her very much
to be standing out here like this.

01:11:53.256 --> 01:11:54.883
I do.

01:11:55.048 --> 01:11:58.268
She's got this new boyfriend,
and he lives here, but...

01:11:59.469 --> 01:12:02.268
She should
really be with me.

01:12:04.266 --> 01:12:06.234
You're Ethan, right?

01:12:07.476 --> 01:12:09.275
Yeah.

01:12:10.564 --> 01:12:14.660
My husband is the new boyfriend
of your ex-girlfriend.

01:12:17.820 --> 01:12:19.447
# Joy to the world

01:12:19.613 --> 01:12:21.331
# The Lord is come

01:12:21.489 --> 01:12:25.165
- # Let earth receive her king
- # Joy to the world

01:12:25.327 --> 01:12:28.705
# Let every heart
prepare him room

01:12:28.873 --> 01:12:31.170
- # And heaven and nature sing
- # Nature sing

01:12:31.333 --> 01:12:33.050
I And heaven and nature sing!
- # Nature sing!

01:12:33.210 --> 01:12:36.839
I And heaven and heaven
and nature sing

01:12:37.005 --> 01:12:38.473
I Joy to the earth

01:12:38.631 --> 01:12:40.678
# The Saviour reigns

01:12:40.842 --> 01:12:44.186
# Let men
their songs employ... I

01:12:44.345 --> 01:12:46.142
Ethan...

01:12:46.306 --> 01:12:48.934
Would you step aside
for a moment, please?

01:12:49.099 --> 01:12:51.193
Sure.

01:12:52.603 --> 01:12:54.651
Oh, Cathy,
I think Paige is here.

01:12:54.813 --> 01:12:56.941
Oh, thank God.
I knew she'd come.

01:13:01.778 --> 01:13:03.450
What is she doing?

01:13:05.073 --> 01:13:07.791
Merry Christmas, Paige.

01:13:07.951 --> 01:13:09.577
It's about to be.

01:13:11.996 --> 01:13:15.045
# Sleigh bells ring
Are you listening?

01:13:15.208 --> 01:13:18.428
# In the lane,
snow is glistening... #

01:13:18.585 --> 01:13:20.338
- My God!
- No! Oh!

01:13:20.504 --> 01:13:23.473
# A beautiful sight
We're happy tonight

01:13:23.632 --> 01:13:26.728
# Walking
in a winter wonderland

01:13:26.885 --> 01:13:28.558
# Gone away... #

01:13:28.720 --> 01:13:30.097
What the hell
is she doing?

01:13:31.139 --> 01:13:32.686
No!

01:13:32.848 --> 01:13:35.272
No, no, no!

01:13:37.395 --> 01:13:38.647
Holy shit!

01:13:38.813 --> 01:13:42.612
# Walking
in a winter wonderland

01:13:42.775 --> 01:13:46.370
# In the meadow,
we can build a snowman... #

01:13:47.613 --> 01:13:49.832
- Terry, do something!
- Oh!

01:13:52.868 --> 01:13:54.790
Paige, for God's sake,
what are you doing?

01:13:54.954 --> 01:13:56.297
Hello, David.

01:13:57.831 --> 01:14:00.333
Oh, my God!

01:14:00.500 --> 01:14:03.175
- David!
- Go left!

01:14:03.336 --> 01:14:05.179
- David, run!
- Whoa!

01:14:05.338 --> 01:14:08.637
- Mom, stop!
- Paige, stop it!

01:14:08.800 --> 01:14:11.724
- Stay still, you!
- Paige!

01:14:11.886 --> 01:14:14.809
- Oh!
- The globe! No!

01:14:14.973 --> 01:14:16.475
Oh, Terry.

01:14:16.640 --> 01:14:18.563
- Globey!
- Paige, for God's sake!

01:14:18.726 --> 01:14:20.899
Run, David!
Careful, David!

01:14:21.061 --> 01:14:23.985
David! Get in the house!
Get in the house!

01:14:24.147 --> 01:14:25.945
Get back in the house!

01:14:49.504 --> 01:14:51.052
Ah!

01:14:59.223 --> 01:15:01.350
Sorry about the noise, Robert!

01:15:01.515 --> 01:15:04.610
- Merry Christmas, Marion!
- Paige?

01:15:04.769 --> 01:15:06.237
Merry Christmas, dear.
Are you alright?

01:15:06.395 --> 01:15:09.365
Aren't you gonna come over
to our house for a bit of dinner?

01:15:09.524 --> 01:15:11.321
Thank you for the invitation,
but it's Christmas Eve,

01:15:11.484 --> 01:15:13.407
and I want to spend it
with my children.

01:15:13.569 --> 01:15:15.037
But I made
your favourite duck!

01:15:15.195 --> 01:15:16.572
I made the duck
with the peaches.

01:15:16.739 --> 01:15:18.707
I don't think
it's a good idea...

01:15:18.866 --> 01:15:21.039
Are you out of your mind?
What is wrong with you?

01:15:21.201 --> 01:15:23.329
You have got
some serious problems.

01:15:23.495 --> 01:15:25.372
- I'm not the only one.
- Jesus!

01:15:25.539 --> 01:15:28.758
Oh, Toby. You're back.

01:15:28.917 --> 01:15:31.465
Oh, you came home
for Christmas. Mmm.

01:15:31.627 --> 01:15:33.300
Hi, Mom.
I told you I'd be back.

01:15:33.463 --> 01:15:35.966
I know. I know.
Thank you, honey. Thank you.

01:15:36.132 --> 01:15:40.103
- Hi, sweetie.
- Hi, Mom.

01:15:40.261 --> 01:15:43.856
- Hi.
- Hello.

01:15:44.014 --> 01:15:47.018
- What happened here?
- Nothing. It's fine.

01:15:47.184 --> 01:15:49.734
Paige, do you think
maybe you should...

01:15:49.895 --> 01:15:51.818
Just a moment, please? OK?

01:15:51.980 --> 01:15:54.608
Toby. How was China?

01:15:56.902 --> 01:16:00.371
It was really great. Yeah.
I...brought you a present.

01:16:00.530 --> 01:16:05.080
You did? Thank you, honey.
Can I have it'?

01:16:05.242 --> 01:16:07.961
- Yeah, OK.
- Paige.

01:16:08.120 --> 01:16:12.216
David. Not now, OK?
Let's just enjoy this.

01:16:12.375 --> 01:16:15.003
Come on. Let's sit.

01:16:17.462 --> 01:16:20.057
I actually brought everyone
presents, since, uh, you know,

01:16:20.215 --> 01:16:23.094
nobody bothered to tell me
what the fuck was going on.

01:16:23.259 --> 01:16:25.261
Here.

01:16:26.388 --> 01:16:27.935
Cathy.

01:16:32.018 --> 01:16:34.770
Holy night...

01:16:34.937 --> 01:16:36.736
Dad. Nina.

01:16:38.191 --> 01:16:39.692
Mom.

01:16:39.859 --> 01:16:41.405
Freak.

01:16:54.247 --> 01:16:55.875
Thank you, Toby.

01:16:56.041 --> 01:16:58.134
So nice, Toby.

01:16:58.292 --> 01:17:00.010
Thank you.

01:17:00.169 --> 01:17:03.343
Thank you, honey.
You're very thoughtful.

01:17:03.507 --> 01:17:06.851
Well, you're welcome.
Merry Christmas.

01:17:07.009 --> 01:17:09.386
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

01:17:09.554 --> 01:17:11.021
Merry Christmas.

01:17:11.180 --> 01:17:13.147
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

01:17:17.477 --> 01:17:19.320
Um...

01:17:20.355 --> 01:17:23.029
I'd like to say a few words.

01:17:25.818 --> 01:17:27.695
When I was
a junior counsellor at camp,

01:17:27.863 --> 01:17:29.410
my favourite camper
made me a...

01:17:29.572 --> 01:17:30.825
Terry.

01:17:30.990 --> 01:17:32.538
...a candle shaped like
a Star of David.

01:17:32.700 --> 01:17:36.296
- Do you mind if I...
- Of course. Of course.

01:17:42.793 --> 01:17:44.841
All of you are...

01:17:47.881 --> 01:17:50.601
...the closest people
in my life.

01:17:53.303 --> 01:17:58.150
And normally, we'd now be eating
some of Paige's butter cookies

01:17:58.308 --> 01:18:00.776
and, uh...

01:18:02.144 --> 01:18:03.988
...drinking Terry's eggnog,

01:18:04.146 --> 01:18:06.899
which you brought over
in the ceramic elf bowl.

01:18:08.568 --> 01:18:11.447
And it's easy to say that
we can just go back to that.

01:18:13.156 --> 01:18:14.998
But there's no going back.

01:18:18.827 --> 01:18:21.454
For either one of us.

01:18:24.374 --> 01:18:27.344
No. There's not.

01:18:31.923 --> 01:18:33.596
Oh, honey.

01:18:33.758 --> 01:18:36.352
Oh.

01:18:43.851 --> 01:18:45.318
I have something
I'd like to say.

01:18:45.478 --> 01:18:47.400
Nina, honey, I don't think
this is a good time.

01:18:47.562 --> 01:18:48.688
I know, but...

01:18:54.652 --> 01:18:56.371
Paige.

01:18:59.157 --> 01:19:00.533
I'm sorry.

01:19:00.699 --> 01:19:03.293
Jesus, Paige!

01:19:07.748 --> 01:19:10.467
Some day, I might actually
thank you for all of this.

01:19:37.235 --> 01:19:38.907
You OK?

01:19:39.070 --> 01:19:40.696
Yeah.

01:19:49.120 --> 01:19:50.872
Maybe we should
just get outta here.

01:19:53.165 --> 01:19:54.633
I'm off till New Year's.

01:19:54.793 --> 01:19:56.841
I've got three weeks
of vacation time.

01:19:57.003 --> 01:20:00.758
We can just go to Mexico
or something.

01:20:02.550 --> 01:20:04.848
We could go tomorrow.

01:20:07.096 --> 01:20:10.816
Just go online,
book tickets.

01:20:18.398 --> 01:20:20.322
Then what happens?

01:20:24.863 --> 01:20:27.081
I'm serious, David.
Then what?

01:20:33.329 --> 01:20:35.127
I don't know.

01:20:45.382 --> 01:20:47.850
- Did I ruin your life?
- No.

01:20:50.845 --> 01:20:53.018
No, that is
the last thing you did.

01:20:56.893 --> 01:20:58.645
I'm sorry.

01:21:07.819 --> 01:21:10.242
You are so amazing.

01:21:10.405 --> 01:21:12.249
So beautiful.

01:21:15.077 --> 01:21:18.672
And you are gonna be
even more amazing.

01:21:22.876 --> 01:21:24.924
Well, we'll see.

01:21:43.311 --> 01:21:46.282
# But you are my star

01:21:46.439 --> 01:21:53.697
# Nina, Nina
Nina, Nina

01:21:53.863 --> 01:21:57.663
# I'm sorry
I cheated on you

01:21:57.826 --> 01:22:01.375
# I won't do it again... #

01:22:01.538 --> 01:22:03.756
Hey.

01:22:29.939 --> 01:22:33.192
On the day
after Christmas, Henry said,

01:22:33.359 --> 01:22:35.611
"Sometimes you have to
burn down your house

01:22:35.777 --> 01:22:37.496
"in order to see the moon."

01:22:37.654 --> 01:22:41.625
Another Asian saying,
but this time I knew what he meant.

01:22:43.243 --> 01:22:45.211
I think Nina
would understand it too.

01:22:45.370 --> 01:22:48.498
She broke up with everyone
that night.

01:22:48.665 --> 01:22:52.214
She said she wanted to try
being alone for once.

01:22:55.337 --> 01:22:59.137
As for me, I really didn't
have a plan or anything, but...

01:22:59.300 --> 01:23:02.804
...I'd saved just enough to afford
my own place in the city.

01:23:02.970 --> 01:23:07.566
And let me stress,
just enough.

01:23:12.313 --> 01:23:14.190
My dad was pretty mopey
for a while

01:23:14.355 --> 01:23:17.154
but also fairly awesome
in his misery.

01:23:17.317 --> 01:23:20.742
He even helped me
furnish my new apartment,

01:23:20.904 --> 01:23:23.873
with stuff from Huffman Koos.

01:23:25.657 --> 01:23:27.035
- You think?
- Yeah.

01:23:27.202 --> 01:23:28.578
Terry and Cathy
were thrilled

01:23:28.745 --> 01:23:30.417
that things were over
with my dad and Nina.

01:23:32.831 --> 01:23:36.051
But not nearly as thrilled
as they were

01:23:36.210 --> 01:23:37.928
with Terry's latest gadget.

01:23:38.085 --> 01:23:39.463
Ooh!

01:23:39.630 --> 01:23:41.473
- I'm gonna switch gears.
- Terry!

01:23:41.632 --> 01:23:44.305
- I'm gonna switch gears.
- Terry! Ooh!

01:23:44.468 --> 01:23:47.721
My mother expanded
her humanitarian efforts

01:23:47.887 --> 01:23:49.355
with Barnyard International.

01:23:49.515 --> 01:23:51.357
I think she finally realised

01:23:51.517 --> 01:23:54.520
that she had gifts to offer
beyond Christmas.

01:23:58.606 --> 01:24:01.485
I hear Nina travelled
around Europe for a while

01:24:01.651 --> 01:24:05.029
and eventually got a job
at a fancy restaurant in Rome.

01:24:05.195 --> 01:24:09.325
This year, her parents are going to
visit her for Thanksgiving.

01:24:15.704 --> 01:24:17.423
I'm not saying
what happened last Christmas

01:24:17.581 --> 01:24:19.754
happened solely
because of Nina.

01:24:21.168 --> 01:24:24.763
I'm saying maybe what happened
needed to happen,

01:24:24.922 --> 01:24:27.345
even for me.

01:24:30.010 --> 01:24:31.808
- Ah!
- Whoa! Whoa!

01:24:31.971 --> 01:24:33.938
My dad came into the city
the other day

01:24:34.098 --> 01:24:35.975
to celebrate my new job.

01:24:37.183 --> 01:24:39.812
He told me he offered the house
to my mom but...

01:24:39.979 --> 01:24:41.525
...she didn't want it.

01:24:41.689 --> 01:24:45.568
He thought about selling
but decided to hold onto it

01:24:45.733 --> 01:24:47.280
for when Toby and I
come visit.

01:24:47.444 --> 01:24:50.196
He's still
figuring things out.

01:24:50.363 --> 01:24:53.957
But, luckily, he has
his best friend to help with that.

01:26:17.862 --> 01:26:21.457
# I saw you, I found you

01:26:21.616 --> 01:26:25.085
# I watched you grow

01:26:25.244 --> 01:26:28.213
# Slowly but surely

01:26:28.373 --> 01:26:32.627
# We ebb and we ï¬‚ow

01:26:32.793 --> 01:26:36.263
# I felt a change

01:26:36.420 --> 01:26:39.971
# Deep in my bones

01:26:40.133 --> 01:26:45.059
# Something new

01:26:45.221 --> 01:26:47.349
# Has grown

01:26:53.187 --> 01:26:56.656
# I was inside waiting

01:26:56.816 --> 01:27:00.410
# Eyes open wide

01:27:00.569 --> 01:27:06.496
# I felt the ground beneath me wake

01:27:07.993 --> 01:27:11.543
# I felt a change

01:27:11.705 --> 01:27:15.300
# Deep in my bones

01:27:15.458 --> 01:27:21.260
# Something new

01:27:21.423 --> 01:27:23.595
# Has grown

01:27:37.604 --> 01:27:40.231
# Up in your room

01:27:40.398 --> 01:27:44.950
# Was a great silent storm

01:27:45.111 --> 01:27:46.408
# Clouds have cleared

01:27:46.571 --> 01:27:51.247
# The air was sweet and warm. #

01:27:52.305 --> 01:27:58.679
