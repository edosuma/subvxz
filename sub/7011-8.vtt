WEBVTT

00:06.048 --> 00:07.935
Happy Veteran's Day.

00:07.999 --> 00:10.366
Now where have you hidden
the chocolate eggs?

00:12.320 --> 00:14.687
Uh, they're everywhere, Fez.
Start looking.

00:18.336 --> 00:21.085
So, Steven.
Isn't Veteran's Day romantic?

00:21.152 --> 00:24.218
Oh, yeah. Government pawns
and missing limbs.

00:25.600 --> 00:27.542
That's <i>amore.</i>

00:27.616 --> 00:30.932
I know, I know. It's a day for
people in love to have fun together.

00:31.008 --> 00:34.269
You know what? All this talk about
having fun makes me want to have fun.

00:34.336 --> 00:37.685
Hey, let's throw stuff
at other stuff.

00:39.040 --> 00:40.949
Man, that's perfect.
I've got stuff.

00:41.024 --> 00:42.879
- I'm in.
- Let's do it.

00:45.408 --> 00:47.317
So, Steven.

00:47.392 --> 00:50.141
Would you like to go to
Mr. Forman's barbecue with me?

00:50.208 --> 00:52.542
No.

00:52.607 --> 00:56.349
- As a matter of fact, I don't want to go anywhere with you.
- You know, that's okay.

00:56.416 --> 01:00.060
You know what?
We can stay in.

01:00.127 --> 01:02.680
No, Jackie. Look, I told you,
again and again...

01:02.752 --> 01:06.364
I have no interest in you,
and you don't have a chance.

01:06.432 --> 01:09.912
And yet, you keep thinking that I have
interest in you, and you have a chance.

01:11.615 --> 01:15.609
Wait, did you just say that you're
interested in me and that I have a chance?

01:17.823 --> 01:20.857
Okay. You know what?
You've forced me to do this.

01:20.928 --> 01:25.401
I'm gonna explain my feelings to you through
a highly disciplined form of Japanese poetry...

01:25.472 --> 01:27.610
haiku.

01:27.679 --> 01:29.534
My heart aches with pain.

01:29.599 --> 01:32.534
When I see you, I vomit.

01:34.976 --> 01:38.271
Die away from me.

01:38.335 --> 01:40.539
Ouch.

01:41.823 --> 01:43.733
<i>Sayonara.</i>

01:48.576 --> 01:52.766
Donna, never have 17 syllables
hurt me so much.

01:54.880 --> 01:56.734
Why would he want to
hurt me like that?

01:56.800 --> 01:59.385
Because you're
stalking him, Jackie.

01:59.455 --> 02:03.099
- No, really, Donna.
- Jackie, really.

02:04.159 --> 02:07.061
You are to Hyde
what Fez is to you.

02:07.135 --> 02:09.852
That's ridiculous.
Fez and I will never happen.

02:11.391 --> 02:13.431
Oh, God.

02:14.719 --> 02:16.792
Steven and I
will never happen.

02:16.864 --> 02:18.751
Jackie, it's all right.

02:18.815 --> 02:21.532
You just gotta get over this
and be strong.

02:21.599 --> 02:24.861
You're right, Donna.
You're right.

02:24.927 --> 02:26.782
Oh, how I wish my daddy
could buy him for me.

02:27.807 --> 02:30.655
Yeah, I know. I know.

02:30.720 --> 02:32.792
This smell like
chocolate to you?

02:34.000 --> 02:40.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:08.215 --> 03:11.892
Look.
I'm Paul Stanley from KISS.

03:16.056 --> 03:18.128
Kelso, don't play
with the cheese.

03:18.199 --> 03:21.614
These damn kids.
They don't respect anything American.

03:21.687 --> 03:25.844
Oh, Red, this isn't about the kids
misusing dairy products.

03:25.912 --> 03:29.523
You're still upset that Bob
marched in the Veteran's Day parade.

03:30.583 --> 03:32.950
Well, he was only
in the National Guard.

03:33.015 --> 03:35.088
It's called Veteran's Day...

03:35.160 --> 03:38.989
not... Pansy-ass,
National Guard...

03:39.063 --> 03:41.332
Wussy, Pansy-ass Day.

03:43.287 --> 03:45.142
Oh, come on, Red.

03:45.207 --> 03:48.556
Are any dirty Commies
less dead because of him?

03:50.776 --> 03:53.165
No, I guess not.

03:53.239 --> 03:55.378
You're right, Kitty.

03:55.447 --> 03:59.441
You know, I'm gonna put away this
uniform, and then we'll fire up that grill.

03:59.512 --> 04:01.748
Hey, Red.
Some parade, huh?

04:01.815 --> 04:05.263
Yeah, sure was,
till the National Guard got there.

04:06.519 --> 04:09.367
Look, I just came over
to invite you to my barbecue.

04:13.464 --> 04:15.318
Your barbecue?

04:15.384 --> 04:20.053
Bob, I have an annual barbecue
every Veteran's Day.

04:20.119 --> 04:21.974
It's my day...

04:22.039 --> 04:23.894
because I'm a veteran.

04:25.815 --> 04:29.361
Well, I'm a veteran too. And I'm having
a barbecue, and you can't stop me.

04:33.047 --> 04:35.862
Hey, Mr. Pinciotti, I didn't know
you were in the Boy Scouts.

04:41.975 --> 04:43.950
Ah.

04:44.919 --> 04:47.156
Hey, everybody.
This is Chip.

04:47.223 --> 04:50.092
He's been after me for a while now,
so I just said, "What the hell?"

04:50.167 --> 04:53.429
- Chip, it's everybody.
- Hey, everybody.

04:53.495 --> 04:55.600
Jackie, I'll, uh, get you
something to drink.

04:55.671 --> 04:57.526
Whatever.

04:59.831 --> 05:01.686
So you're with
this Chip guy now?

05:01.751 --> 05:04.206
- Yep.
- Huh.

05:04.279 --> 05:07.149
Why? Do you care?

05:07.224 --> 05:10.191
No, I mean, if you want
to date this guy, that's cool.

05:10.263 --> 05:12.237
It is?

05:12.311 --> 05:16.206
And then Steven said,
"That's cool."

05:16.279 --> 05:19.727
But not like "cool."
More like he's jealous.

05:19.800 --> 05:22.352
Jackie, or he just
thinks it's cool.

05:22.423 --> 05:24.976
Donna, it is so romantic.

05:25.047 --> 05:26.935
Just like <i>West Side Story.</i>

05:28.791 --> 05:31.475
Yeah, but without the dancing
and the Puerto Ricans.

05:33.591 --> 05:36.723
Wait. Is Fez Puerto Rican?

05:38.391 --> 05:40.246
You know what?
I don't know.

05:40.311 --> 05:42.166
Huh.

05:43.767 --> 05:46.833
This will show Red. We're gonna
have the best barbecue ever.

05:46.903 --> 05:51.343
If there's one thing you learn
in the National Guard, it's how to cook.

05:51.415 --> 05:54.612
Oh, I'm gonna defrost some chicken.

05:56.055 --> 05:59.252
Mom, the Formans have
a barbecue every Veteran's Day.

05:59.320 --> 06:02.800
- I mean, why are we having one?
- Honey, this isn't about a barbecue.

06:02.871 --> 06:05.773
This is about
your father going bankrupt.

06:05.847 --> 06:08.782
- Now help me with these chairs.
- What? What are you talking about?

06:08.855 --> 06:12.172
We need the chairs
for people to sit on.

06:13.464 --> 06:16.627
No, Mom.
About Dad being bankrupt.

06:16.696 --> 06:19.314
Your dad's appliance store's
going out of business...

06:19.383 --> 06:21.455
'cause he can't compete
with Price Mart.

06:21.527 --> 06:23.698
So he decided to throw
a big barbecue.

06:24.695 --> 06:27.116
Okay, I'm still
not getting this.

06:27.191 --> 06:31.315
Oh, your dad wants to be
big shot one last time...

06:31.383 --> 06:35.060
before everybody discovers
what a failure he is.

06:35.127 --> 06:38.161
- Oh, my God.
- And please don't tell anybody.

06:38.231 --> 06:40.565
He's very sensitive
about being a failure.

06:48.119 --> 06:49.974
Here you go.
Enjoy your burger.

06:50.039 --> 06:54.349
And thank you for choosing the Formans
for your Veteran's Day celebration needs.

06:56.312 --> 06:58.733
Kitty, why is everybody
over at Bob's?

06:58.807 --> 07:01.196
They've got chicken.

07:04.023 --> 07:06.511
Chicken?

07:06.583 --> 07:11.155
Well, isn't that a surprise?
A National Guardsman serving up chicken.

07:13.303 --> 07:17.078
He's not gonna get away with this. Eric, chop
up some onions and mix it in with the meat.

07:17.143 --> 07:19.412
Why can't we just put the onions
on top of the burger?

07:19.479 --> 07:23.057
Eric, do you want to win
this thing or don't you?

07:25.335 --> 07:27.953
Okay, not-crazy Dad.

07:29.495 --> 07:32.692
- Eric, can I talk to you?
- Uh, not really, Donna. I got to bust hump.

07:32.759 --> 07:36.272
- My dad wants to crush your dad's barbecue.
- What? Why?

07:36.343 --> 07:40.336
Well, apparently, my dad believes that
if your dad's barbecue is better than his...

07:40.407 --> 07:43.255
America will fall
to the Russkies.

07:43.319 --> 07:47.410
Did you ever stop to think that maybe my
dad's barbecue is really important to him?

07:51.287 --> 07:53.840
Uh, no.

07:53.911 --> 07:56.333
Because it's just
a stupid barbecue.

07:57.303 --> 07:59.157
It's not stupid.

07:59.223 --> 08:01.328
I'm so sick of your dad.
He's such a jerk.

08:01.399 --> 08:03.919
Whoa. My dad's a jerk?

08:03.991 --> 08:08.366
Well, Donna, your dad's a jerk,
and he's just copying my dad.

08:08.439 --> 08:11.887
And your dad didn't even
fight in the war.

08:11.959 --> 08:13.813
You're just
a National Guard kid.

08:13.879 --> 08:17.140
Yeah, I said it.
What? What?

08:17.207 --> 08:19.825
Oh, yeah? Well,
you and Red are going down.

08:19.895 --> 08:21.750
And you know what else?
I was wrong, Eric.

08:21.815 --> 08:24.466
Red's not a jerk.
He's an ass, and you're an ass.

08:24.535 --> 08:27.764
'Cause the ass doesn't fall far from
the ass tree. "What did I say, what?"

08:40.342 --> 08:44.653
Man, I can't believe Jackie
chose that guy over me.

08:44.727 --> 08:46.964
- Or me for that matter.
- Yeah, that's true.

08:47.031 --> 08:48.886
'Cause you're
a good-looking guy.

08:50.167 --> 08:52.076
Back at you, Kelso.

08:53.367 --> 08:56.215
Your eyelashes,
they go for, like, miles.

08:56.279 --> 08:58.483
I've heard that.

08:58.551 --> 09:01.867
Yeah. I'm what's known
as "man-pretty."

09:04.503 --> 09:08.529
Bad news, Dad.
The Pinciottis have... these.

09:10.391 --> 09:13.206
Red, white and blue napkins?

09:13.271 --> 09:15.660
That clever S.O.B.

09:16.887 --> 09:19.276
And I cheaped out
and went for the plain white.

09:20.727 --> 09:23.377
So what, now we surrender?

09:24.727 --> 09:26.582
Surrender?

09:26.647 --> 09:31.502
You know, if this were an actual war,
you'd be the first in a body bag.

09:31.575 --> 09:34.390
Yes, sir. I'm gonna go
refill the ketchups.

09:43.191 --> 09:45.101
Schlitz.

09:49.623 --> 09:53.365
Hey, Jackie. Who's that hot guy
you brought with you?

09:53.431 --> 09:56.246
Back off!
I need him for right now...

09:56.311 --> 09:58.929
but you can have him
when I'm done, as usual.

10:00.791 --> 10:05.198
Wait a second, Jackie.
Are you working an angle here? Nice.

10:05.271 --> 10:08.173
No, there's no angle.

10:08.247 --> 10:10.189
I just want to see
if I can make Steven jealous.

10:10.263 --> 10:13.078
So you're gonna sleep with him
a couple of times and see what happens.

10:13.143 --> 10:16.372
- Yeah, I've been down that road.
- No!

10:16.439 --> 10:20.946
Oh, you're such a child. Send him
to my room when you're done.

10:23.799 --> 10:26.832
- So, you and Jackie, huh?
- Yeah, isn't she something?

10:26.903 --> 10:30.678
- Sure.
- Sometimes, though, I kind of hate it when she talks.

10:30.743 --> 10:33.940
I hear you.

10:34.007 --> 10:36.625
And she's always talking.

10:36.695 --> 10:39.662
But, I figure it's worth it
if I can nail her.

10:40.663 --> 10:42.517
Huh.

10:42.583 --> 10:45.266
Yeah, you should probably
think about that, man.

10:45.335 --> 10:47.604
You know, I mean,
Jackie's kind of young.

10:47.671 --> 10:51.316
- She only had, like, one boyfriend, so...
- Hey, that's not a big surprise.

10:51.383 --> 10:53.325
You know, she's a bitch.

10:55.319 --> 10:57.228
Oh, no.

11:01.303 --> 11:03.158
- Steven, what happened?
- What?

11:03.223 --> 11:08.591
Nothing. Just somebody... And then
the guy said "bitch," and there's nothing.

11:10.679 --> 11:13.396
Oh, my God.
He called me a bitch?

11:13.463 --> 11:15.634
And you hit him.
And that's what happened, isn't it?

11:16.726 --> 11:18.581
No.

11:19.606 --> 11:24.079
Liar. I am the bitch,
and you love me.

11:31.734 --> 11:33.938
Stop staring at me.

11:34.966 --> 11:38.382
Quit it.
I'm not this guy.

11:40.215 --> 11:42.932
Oh, God.

11:51.086 --> 11:54.152
Oh, Steven, I saw what happened.
Is your girlfriend okay?

11:57.806 --> 11:59.715
My girlfriend?

11:59.790 --> 12:04.547
Yeah, the-the bossy, little, mean one
you're always hanging around with.

12:04.622 --> 12:07.491
- Oh, uh, Jackie.
- She's not my girlfriend.

12:07.566 --> 12:09.868
Are you sure?

12:09.934 --> 12:11.974
Yes, I'm sure.

12:12.047 --> 12:16.782
I don't like her. She's... shallow
and rich and mean and bossy.

12:16.847 --> 12:21.386
- She's everything that I hate.
- But, Steven, you hate everything.

12:21.454 --> 12:25.862
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Well, it means that maybe you like her...

12:25.935 --> 12:28.804
'cause I kind of think you do.

12:28.878 --> 12:32.173
No. How could I like her?

12:32.238 --> 12:34.660
Because I don't like her.
Because I can't like her.

12:34.735 --> 12:37.637
Mrs. Forman,
if I like her, shoot me.

12:37.711 --> 12:39.566
Pow!

12:51.694 --> 12:53.767
Jackie, get your car.
We're going on a freakin' date.

13:00.495 --> 13:04.870
Oh, my God.
It's a Veteran's Day miracle.

13:11.886 --> 13:13.741
Red, white and blue
cheeseburgers.

13:13.806 --> 13:15.879
Eric, you're a genius.

13:15.951 --> 13:18.569
Voilà.

13:18.639 --> 13:20.494
Sparkler dogs.

13:20.559 --> 13:22.631
God bless America.

13:22.702 --> 13:26.314
- Freshly squeezed.
- That's fresh.

13:27.438 --> 13:29.740
Ah, beer in the bottle.

13:29.807 --> 13:32.174
That's class.

13:32.238 --> 13:36.394
- The keg is tapped.
- Bend over and kiss it good-bye, Bob.

13:36.462 --> 13:40.139
Here comes the big one.

13:41.614 --> 13:43.687
A keg?

13:43.758 --> 13:45.613
Oh, great.

13:45.678 --> 13:47.750
Red's gone nuclear.

13:47.822 --> 13:50.375
This barbecue is over.

13:50.446 --> 13:53.643
Dad, that's it?
You're just gonna give up?

13:53.710 --> 13:56.012
We had sparkler dogs.
We could win this thing.

13:56.079 --> 13:59.112
No. Donna, thanks.
But it's over.

13:59.182 --> 14:04.136
I just wanted one big blowout.
One last hurrah, you know?

14:04.207 --> 14:07.109
Oh, why didn't I
rent the one-man band?

14:20.910 --> 14:22.765
This is the best date ever.

14:24.942 --> 14:27.757
Jackie, we haven't
talked in 30 minutes.

14:27.822 --> 14:32.394
That's okay. Steven,
you don't have to say anything.

14:32.462 --> 14:34.469
I understand you.

14:34.542 --> 14:37.477
- Oh, you do, do you?
- Sure.

14:37.550 --> 14:40.103
Okay, so you're probably
sitting there thinking...

14:40.174 --> 14:42.346
"I'm on this date
with this girl...

14:42.415 --> 14:45.481
"who really,
really likes me.

14:45.550 --> 14:48.419
And she's so beautiful."

14:48.494 --> 14:50.731
- Jackie.
- Hush.

14:52.719 --> 14:55.436
And you're wondering...

14:55.502 --> 14:57.738
"How can I open up to her...

14:57.806 --> 15:01.668
"when everyone I have
ever loved have abandoned me?

15:01.742 --> 15:04.230
Am I even worthy of love?"

15:06.159 --> 15:10.381
Well, you are, Steven.
You are.

15:17.966 --> 15:20.039
It's okay, Steven. It's okay.
Know what? Let it out.

15:20.110 --> 15:21.965
- Let it all out.
- Okay.

15:22.030 --> 15:23.885
It's okay.

15:29.422 --> 15:32.040
- Let's go home.
- Oh, come on. I'm kidding.

15:32.110 --> 15:35.885
No, this is all right. We can
hang out here for a while, okay?

15:37.006 --> 15:39.624
God.

15:39.694 --> 15:41.898
Here, have some of my pop.

15:41.966 --> 15:43.974
Sure.

15:53.422 --> 15:55.910
Okay.

15:55.982 --> 16:00.935
- Well, we've gone through three batches of ambrosia salad.
- Three batches!

16:01.006 --> 16:04.683
Not since D-day has there been
such a complete and glorious victory.

16:04.750 --> 16:07.052
Oh, hi, Donna.

16:07.118 --> 16:08.973
Well, I hope you're all happy.

16:09.038 --> 16:11.853
'Cause you ruined
my dad's barbecue.

16:11.918 --> 16:14.569
All he wanted was one more
good day before everybody found out...

16:14.638 --> 16:17.256
that his store was closing,
and he's going bankrupt.

16:17.326 --> 16:20.076
- Wait. What?
- Yeah. Bargain Bob's is closing this week...

16:20.142 --> 16:22.825
so congratulations.

16:22.894 --> 16:25.676
Oh, my God. I feel so bad.

16:25.742 --> 16:29.964
Well, you should.
You ruined his barbecue.

16:31.342 --> 16:33.644
Why would you do that?

16:33.710 --> 16:37.027
What? Me?
You were...

16:37.102 --> 16:40.451
Eric, for God's sakes,
the man is almost a veteran.

16:43.438 --> 16:46.121
Okay, fine. You know what?
Fine. It's all my fault.

16:46.190 --> 16:49.605
But, Dad, you, you gotta make
everyone here go next door.

16:49.678 --> 16:51.882
Eric, you're right.
We have got to go over there.

16:51.950 --> 16:54.372
They are our neighbors.
They are our best friends.

16:54.446 --> 16:57.675
Yeah, I suppose.

16:59.150 --> 17:02.150
All right, freeloaders.
Let's move it on over to Bob's.

17:02.222 --> 17:05.996
- Eric, grab that keg.
- Okay, I'm on it.

17:19.855 --> 17:22.637
Hey, what's everybody doing here?

17:22.702 --> 17:25.190
Congratulations, Bob,
you really out-barbecued me.

17:25.262 --> 17:27.531
I gotta say.
You're one hell of a guy.

17:29.678 --> 17:33.606
Oh, Bob.
We just love you so much.

17:33.678 --> 17:37.606
Midge, you told.

17:39.854 --> 17:43.978
Look, Bob.
I just want you to know that...

17:44.046 --> 17:47.308
you've been a real good neighbor
and a real good friend.

17:47.374 --> 17:49.578
And if you ever need it,
I'm here for you.

17:49.646 --> 17:52.232
Thanks, Red.

17:52.302 --> 17:54.157
Oh, but, uh...

17:54.222 --> 17:56.611
I can't help you
if you cry, Bob.

17:58.158 --> 18:01.453
- Don't cry.
- These are tears of joy, Red.

18:01.518 --> 18:03.787
Yeah, that's bad too, Bob.

18:06.926 --> 18:09.195
Move!

18:09.262 --> 18:11.117
Come on.

18:13.102 --> 18:15.753
- Hey.
- Oh, hey. What's up? Hi.

18:19.598 --> 18:21.485
Look, I'm sorry.

18:21.550 --> 18:23.819
Everyone came by,
and I know you did that...

18:23.886 --> 18:26.122
so... thanks.

18:26.190 --> 18:28.427
No, Donna.
I'm sorry.

18:28.494 --> 18:30.949
Look, you know that I wouldn't
have acted like such a jerk...

18:31.022 --> 18:34.317
if I knew something so terrible
was happening to your dad.

18:34.382 --> 18:37.578
No, I know. I know. It's okay.

18:37.646 --> 18:40.330
- My folks didn't want me to say anything, so.
- Yeah.

18:40.398 --> 18:43.048
No, I mean. Yeah.

18:43.118 --> 18:44.973
Yeah.

18:47.118 --> 18:48.972
Are you okay?

18:49.038 --> 18:51.940
Yeah, and no.

18:52.910 --> 18:55.244
I don't know.

19:07.278 --> 19:09.831
So...

19:09.902 --> 19:11.974
our first date's almost over.

19:12.046 --> 19:14.348
Yeah.

19:14.414 --> 19:17.032
What'd you think?

19:19.438 --> 19:22.537
It was no worse than bowling.

19:22.606 --> 19:25.355
I... I don't hate bowling.

19:42.702 --> 19:45.255
Huh.

19:47.022 --> 19:49.389
Okay.
I didn't feel anything.

19:50.574 --> 19:54.884
- Nothing?
- No, I mean, the kiss was hot, but...

19:57.454 --> 19:59.559
Well, did you feel something?

19:59.630 --> 20:03.426
Uh, no.

20:04.878 --> 20:07.812
Well, no.

20:13.390 --> 20:16.652
So I guess that's it then.

20:16.718 --> 20:19.206
Turns out you were right
about us all along.

20:19.277 --> 20:21.132
Yeah.

20:22.990 --> 20:24.965
So what happens now?

20:28.558 --> 20:31.144
I'm not opposed to doing it.

20:31.214 --> 20:33.068
Take me home, you pig.

20:34.350 --> 20:36.488
Yes, dear.

20:41.214 --> 20:43.069
Fez.

20:44.670 --> 20:47.255
I don't feel so good.

20:47.326 --> 20:49.181
Me neither.

20:49.246 --> 20:51.351
You see a horse?

20:52.478 --> 20:54.933
- Yes, I do.
- Is it pink?

20:55.934 --> 20:58.170
Uh-huh.

21:00.542 --> 21:05.692
This was the best
barbecue ever.
