01:02.812 --> 01:04.813

01:09.069 --> 01:11.070
(woman speaking Russian)

01:43.645 --> 01:45.395
(moo)

02:13.591 --> 02:15.592
(crowd murmuring)

02:19.013 --> 02:21.014
(sizzling)

03:31.836 --> 03:33.503
(car horns honking)

03:33.671 --> 03:35.672
(music playing)

03:44.766 --> 03:46.892
ANNOUNCER:
Belarus. Rated R.

03:52.482 --> 03:53.690
(screams)

03:53.858 --> 03:56.526
Coming soon to a theater near you.

04:08.706 --> 04:09.873
WOMAN:
Ladies and gentlemen,

04:10.041 --> 04:13.418
the second half of our show will begin
in just a couple of minutes.

04:13.586 --> 04:15.087
Please return to your seats.

04:19.801 --> 04:21.218
(Pavel speaking Russian)

04:31.813 --> 04:34.856
Ηey, Misha.

04:35.024 --> 04:37.150
I didn't think anybody
was actually gonna show up.

04:37.318 --> 04:39.444
I'm sorry. Do...
Do we know each other?

04:41.572 --> 04:43.532
Yes, but you don't remember.

04:43.700 --> 04:46.410
I'm, uh... I'm Abby Gibbons,
Bob's niece.

04:47.412 --> 04:50.080
Right. Yeah.

04:50.248 --> 04:54.126
You, uh, you came to visit him
about seven years ago.

04:54.294 --> 04:56.795
Such a cute little girl you were then.

04:56.963 --> 04:58.922
Thanks.

04:59.090 --> 05:00.632
Actually it was nine years ago,

05:00.800 --> 05:03.593
and, uh, I remember you very well.

05:03.761 --> 05:06.054
You been in Moscow long?

05:06.222 --> 05:07.055
About a year.

05:07.223 --> 05:10.225
Oh. Bob never mentioned it.

05:10.393 --> 05:13.854
Yeah, well,
that's my secretive uncle.

05:14.188 --> 05:17.107
(microphone feedback)

05:17.275 --> 05:18.859
WOMAN:
And the winner is...

05:19.027 --> 05:22.070
creative director Mikhail Galkin.

05:22.238 --> 05:24.281
(cheering)

05:24.449 --> 05:29.161
Still one of the leaders
in the marketing of movies.

05:30.204 --> 05:31.079
Aha.

05:31.247 --> 05:32.748
I have just seen the founder

05:32.915 --> 05:35.292
and president of Best Solution,

05:35.460 --> 05:38.045
pioneer of the Russian
advertising industry,

05:38.212 --> 05:39.379
Bob Gibbons!

05:52.101 --> 05:52.976
BOB: Thank you.

05:53.144 --> 05:55.854
What are you doing? Misha?
Come on, get over here.

05:57.815 --> 05:59.941
Bob, what's happened?
Why are you back already?

06:00.109 --> 06:01.068
We hit a snag.

06:01.235 --> 06:03.487
You won't be making partner today.

06:03.654 --> 06:04.946
I'm sorry, Mish.

06:13.498 --> 06:14.706
There you are.

06:16.417 --> 06:18.293
MISΗA:
Let's face it, Bob.

06:20.755 --> 06:23.965
For you, this agency is just a cover,

06:24.133 --> 06:27.594
and your people are never going
to let me be a partner in it.

06:29.847 --> 06:31.515
All right, I got it.

06:34.352 --> 06:37.020
So, what are you suggesting here?

06:37.188 --> 06:39.523
MISHA: Very simple.
If I can't be a partner,

06:39.690 --> 06:42.818
then I at least want to be making
the same money off it that you are.

06:42.985 --> 06:45.779
(cellphone vibrates)

06:45.947 --> 06:48.698
Yeah. Yes.

06:51.869 --> 06:53.787
Where are you? Abby?

06:54.580 --> 06:58.375
Why won't you ever listen
to one thing I ask you to do?

06:59.043 --> 07:00.419
I will call you later. (sighs)

07:01.921 --> 07:04.047
Goddamn girl's going to be the death of me.

07:04.215 --> 07:05.776
She won't listen to her... her parents!

07:05.800 --> 07:09.052
Took a semester off
to do some sort of internship here,

07:09.220 --> 07:11.054
and now she... she won't leave!

07:18.438 --> 07:20.522
Oh, Christ.

07:20.690 --> 07:23.233
10 fucking 15,
and the sun's just starting to set.

07:23.401 --> 07:27.821
I... I will never understand
this crazy country.

07:29.574 --> 07:30.949
Oh, one more thing.

07:31.117 --> 07:32.951
(chuckles)

07:33.119 --> 07:35.078
Uh...

07:35.246 --> 07:38.415
I saw how Abby’s
got her eye on you, so...

07:38.583 --> 07:41.668
she's young and... and stupid.

07:41.836 --> 07:43.753
Please...

07:46.507 --> 07:48.300
stay away from her.

07:57.768 --> 07:59.769
(seabirds calling)

08:11.032 --> 08:13.366
FEMALE NARRATOR:
This is Joseph Pascal,

08:13.534 --> 08:17.579
the world's leading specialist
on marketing.

08:17.747 --> 08:21.875
PASCAL: Ah. Bravo.

08:22.043 --> 08:24.836
NARRATOR: Today, the biggest
fast-food chains were reeling

08:25.004 --> 08:27.339
from a record decline in profits.

08:27.507 --> 08:31.551
Their representatives had assembled
before this guru of marketing

08:31.719 --> 08:34.554
with the hope that he could
make a miracle.

08:34.722 --> 08:38.308
I want to talk to you today...

08:38.476 --> 08:40.977
about love.

08:41.145 --> 08:43.730
See, I... I have struggled

08:44.482 --> 08:47.734
to find a way to restore the people's
love of your products,

08:47.902 --> 08:50.946
but it hasn't worked out.

08:51.113 --> 08:54.241
Consumers just no longer
wish to buy them.

08:54.408 --> 08:56.993
When it's over, it's over.
They no longer love you.

08:57.161 --> 09:00.330
The era of fast food has passed.

09:02.250 --> 09:06.962
But I do have a proposal...

09:08.464 --> 09:11.007
eh, something which exceeds
the limits of marketing

09:11.175 --> 09:13.593
in its traditional form,

09:13.761 --> 09:17.681
a plan which will change the world.

09:17.848 --> 09:21.977
Together, we will make fat
beautiful again.

09:22.144 --> 09:24.813
But first, a question.

09:24.981 --> 09:27.399
Ηow far are you willing to go...

09:29.360 --> 09:31.528
to solve your problems?

09:32.697 --> 09:33.697
Whatever it takes.

09:33.864 --> 09:36.533
Within the limits of the law,
of course.

09:37.952 --> 09:41.413
I'm afraid that's not far enough,

09:41.581 --> 09:45.333
not even nearly far enough,
ladies and gentlemen.

09:45.501 --> 09:47.627
NARRATOR:
The guru's plan was approved,

09:47.795 --> 09:50.380
but due to budget cuts,
it would have to begin

09:50.548 --> 09:55.010
in the third-world markets
of Kenya, Brazil and Russia.

09:55.177 --> 09:58.471
So I called because I wanted
your advice on something,

09:58.639 --> 10:00.015
Mr. Marketing Award Winner.

10:00.182 --> 10:02.892
But you have to promise
to keep it a secret from Bob.

10:09.859 --> 10:13.028
It's amazing how you Americans
all believe in the seat belt.

10:16.782 --> 10:20.035
In America,
they advertise them really well.

10:24.582 --> 10:25.415
(chuckles)

10:25.583 --> 10:27.542
(cellphone ringing)

10:31.881 --> 10:33.089
MAN: Yeah, Misha.

10:33.257 --> 10:35.634
Yeah, she's still screaming
like total shit.

10:35.801 --> 10:37.177
You're fired.

10:37.345 --> 10:38.553
Your company's fired.

10:38.721 --> 10:39.846
Do you hear me?

10:40.014 --> 10:43.767
You're never going to work
on another movie for this studio again.

10:43.934 --> 10:44.934
(hangs up)

11:11.462 --> 11:12.295
Pavel...

11:12.463 --> 11:14.464
(continues in Russian)

11:17.510 --> 11:18.635
(Pavel speaking Russian)

11:18.803 --> 11:20.804
I'm sorry. I have to go.

11:27.478 --> 11:28.770
Let's go.

11:32.942 --> 11:34.943
(screaming)

11:36.779 --> 11:38.738
MAN: Cut it!

11:39.907 --> 11:41.658
Check it out.

11:41.826 --> 11:44.869
NARRATOR: One of the key instruments
in the Russian part of the plan

11:45.037 --> 11:48.289
was an extreme-makeover
reality TV show.

11:48.457 --> 11:49.916
They're looking for
a Russian production company

11:50.084 --> 11:52.043
to shoot a Russian version
of this show.

11:53.546 --> 11:56.840
The corporate sponsor's representative
is in Moscow right now.

11:57.007 --> 12:00.468
I want to do the pitch to them myself
and get the contract for Astra,

12:00.636 --> 12:02.554
and then they're gonna
make me an exec producer.

12:06.058 --> 12:09.144
Do you really think
this is going to work?

12:11.105 --> 12:13.022
Nope.

12:13.190 --> 12:15.400
Misha, what you're doing had better work.

12:15.568 --> 12:18.027
We need 8 out of 10
people tomorrow

12:18.195 --> 12:21.072
in that focus group
to want to see this movie.

12:21.240 --> 12:24.033
Don't worry, Mr. Johnson.
It'll meet your expectations.

12:24.201 --> 12:26.202
(siren passing)

12:31.459 --> 12:35.003
So, Misha, where did you learn
that amazingly perfect English of yours?

12:36.005 --> 12:38.173
My father was a British communist,

12:38.340 --> 12:40.300
immigrated here.

12:40.468 --> 12:42.510
Then later, he had a falling-out
with communism,

12:42.678 --> 12:44.179
but they wouldn't let him leave.

12:44.346 --> 12:45.889
(cellphone ringing)

12:46.056 --> 12:47.891
That's terrible.

12:48.058 --> 12:50.018
Yeah.

12:50.186 --> 12:53.021
Belarus. Rated R.

13:00.613 --> 13:03.573
Coming soon to a theater near you.

13:09.413 --> 13:10.747
Ηi, Pavel.

13:10.915 --> 13:12.415
Yeah, it's fine.

13:12.583 --> 13:14.209
Just add some graphics over the shot

13:14.376 --> 13:16.628
that say,
"No one will hear this scream."

13:32.478 --> 13:33.686
Wow!

13:45.157 --> 13:47.450
Sunrise in the middle of the night.

13:49.161 --> 13:50.203
It's so weird.

13:50.371 --> 13:52.997
(cellphone rings)

13:53.165 --> 13:56.125
BOB: Mish, you know how much
I wanted you to make partner,

13:56.293 --> 13:58.127
'cause I love you.

13:58.295 --> 13:59.629
Let's have a drink.

14:00.631 --> 14:04.133
So, my very first meal

14:04.301 --> 14:06.469
at The Burger in Moscow.

14:06.637 --> 14:09.639
I knew about your guys' custom

14:09.807 --> 14:13.560
for paying for extra ketchup,

14:13.727 --> 14:16.396
so I paid for six packets.

14:16.564 --> 14:20.024
But then, I needed more.

14:20.192 --> 14:22.986
But the cashier says...

14:23.153 --> 14:27.198
"Nyet. Nyet.

14:27.366 --> 14:30.285
You've already had enough."

14:30.452 --> 14:32.996
Do you understand
what I'm saying to you?

14:33.163 --> 14:37.625
Like she fucking decides
that I have had enough.

14:37.793 --> 14:40.086
It's not a real "The Burger," Misha,

14:40.254 --> 14:42.088
if I can't have extra ketchup.

14:42.256 --> 14:45.800
It's just a fucking...
It's a fucking facade.

14:45.968 --> 14:53.516
This whole country is just like
one Hollywood back-lot fucking facade.

14:55.227 --> 14:58.271
And it's a really shitty-made one at that.

14:58.439 --> 15:01.482
(boat horn honking)

15:03.861 --> 15:06.279
(woman speaking Russian)

15:06.447 --> 15:08.608
MISHA: How many of you
would buy a ticket to this movie

15:08.657 --> 15:10.366
based on the advertisement?

15:13.203 --> 15:16.122
That's right!
I told you this movie could work.

15:17.291 --> 15:18.458
Thanks, brother.

15:18.626 --> 15:20.376
All right, my friend.

15:20.544 --> 15:22.462
Mish, thanks.

15:22.630 --> 15:23.796
Oh, come on.

15:26.967 --> 15:29.385
- Bob.
- Yeah?

15:29.553 --> 15:30.720
You forgot your pen.

15:30.888 --> 15:33.556
Oh, yes. Thank you.

15:33.724 --> 15:35.885
And you still haven't got back to me
about my new deal.

15:35.935 --> 15:38.394
I know. I know.

15:48.072 --> 15:50.698
NARRATOR:
Misha discovered his talent for marketing

15:50.866 --> 15:54.661
shortly after the fall of the Soviet Union.

15:54.828 --> 15:56.579
Communism was over,

15:56.747 --> 15:59.207
but capitalism had only just begun.

16:00.209 --> 16:04.003
The forbidden brands of the West
became available 24/7

16:04.171 --> 16:06.881
in thousands of newly born kiosks.

16:09.760 --> 16:12.303
Misha was working
at one of those kiosks,

16:12.471 --> 16:16.057
having just completed
his university history degree.

16:18.769 --> 16:22.897
There, he learned
the three basic rules of marketing.

16:23.941 --> 16:27.860
He advised the owner
to specialize in selling vodka only.

16:29.989 --> 16:32.281
- Sales doubled.
(man speaking Russian)

16:32.449 --> 16:33.783
(laughs)

16:33.951 --> 16:34.993
(speaking Russian)

16:35.160 --> 16:37.662
Misha suggested hanging
bright yellow signs

16:37.830 --> 16:41.040
above the kiosks
announcing vodka only.

16:41.208 --> 16:42.792
(speaking Russian)

16:42.960 --> 16:46.212
Sales increased 12 times.

16:46.380 --> 16:49.632
The owner bought himself
a used Mercedes S320.

16:49.800 --> 16:50.675
(honks horn)

16:50.843 --> 16:52.760
(laughs)

16:52.928 --> 16:53.761
(speaking Russian)

16:53.929 --> 16:56.097
But when Misha asked for a raise,

16:56.265 --> 16:58.474
he was fired on the spot.

16:58.642 --> 17:00.977
He had learned the third rule:

17:01.145 --> 17:02.770
Get paid up front,

17:02.938 --> 17:05.314
because no one believes in marketing.

17:08.986 --> 17:10.611
Εnterprising young Misha

17:10.779 --> 17:13.906
abandoned his career
as an unskilled laborer

17:14.074 --> 17:16.826
and opened
his own advertising agency,

17:16.993 --> 17:19.579
Mikhail Galkin Global Marketing,

17:19.747 --> 17:22.874
with funds borrowed
from an old family friend,

17:23.041 --> 17:24.416
Yuri Nikoliavich.

17:48.067 --> 17:49.108
Nyet.

17:51.904 --> 17:53.279
(speaking Russian)

18:21.517 --> 18:23.142
(sizzling)

18:23.310 --> 18:26.145
(laughs)

18:31.568 --> 18:35.279
NARRATOR: That was the first time
Misha appealed to God for help.

18:35.447 --> 18:36.405
(knock on door)

18:36.573 --> 18:38.241
Ηi. I'm Bob Gibbons.

18:38.408 --> 18:41.410
NARRATOR:
Bob agreed to bail Misha out of debt

18:41.578 --> 18:46.499
and to hire him in Bob's soon-to-be opened
American-Russian advertising agency.

18:46.667 --> 18:48.376
There was just one catch.

18:48.544 --> 18:50.503
MISΗA: Uh, sorry. I, uh...

18:50.671 --> 18:53.714
I don't quite understand this.
What...

18:53.882 --> 18:55.550
What are you, a spy?

18:56.927 --> 18:58.803
You... You want me
to become a spy, too?

18:58.971 --> 19:02.223
I'm not a spy. I'm a historian.

19:02.391 --> 19:03.891
Would you do me a favor, please?

19:04.059 --> 19:05.434
Would you just calm down?

19:05.602 --> 19:09.105
Just relax and listen, Misha.

19:10.607 --> 19:12.358
Misha?

19:12.526 --> 19:16.654
I'm a real Madison Avenue adman,
30 years experience, all right?

19:16.822 --> 19:19.198
I do a little work with U.S. A.I.D.,

19:19.366 --> 19:24.036
which sometimes works with other
organizations that shall remain nameless.

19:24.204 --> 19:27.790
Listen, you guys are starting up
a democracy over here,

19:27.958 --> 19:30.126
but democracy isn't just about
switching governments.

19:30.294 --> 19:32.170
It's about...
It's about business.

19:32.337 --> 19:33.296
It's about advertising.

19:33.463 --> 19:36.716
It's about Coke versus Pepsi.

19:38.552 --> 19:44.056
Now, we will start
a serious advertising agency,

19:44.224 --> 19:46.142
and we will make a lot of money.

19:47.311 --> 19:50.271
The client list is going to be
the new political candidates,

19:50.439 --> 19:51.772
the business elite,

19:51.940 --> 19:53.482
movie producers,

19:53.650 --> 19:55.276
and all you have to do...

19:55.444 --> 19:59.155
is, uh, keep your eyes and ears
trained on them and report.

19:59.323 --> 20:00.698
(thunder rumbling)

20:00.866 --> 20:03.326
Re... Report what?

20:03.493 --> 20:05.578
Whatever you see.
Whatever you hear.

20:05.746 --> 20:07.580
(car engine racing)

20:07.748 --> 20:08.581
That's it.

20:08.749 --> 20:09.582
(car door opens)

20:09.750 --> 20:11.500
(gunshots)

20:11.668 --> 20:12.960
(man cries out)

20:13.128 --> 20:15.129
(car engine racing)

20:24.681 --> 20:25.681
Wow.

20:27.184 --> 20:28.643
Poor bastard.

20:28.810 --> 20:30.269
That's my investor.

20:30.437 --> 20:31.729
Yeah.

20:33.065 --> 20:35.608
You're gonna be needing
a new investor.

20:39.488 --> 20:40.780
Picture it, Misha.

20:40.948 --> 20:42.949
Your new job is just...

20:43.116 --> 20:46.953
spreading the principles
of freedom and democracy.

20:47.120 --> 20:50.706
NARRATOR: And so began Misha's
career as a marketer spy.

20:50.874 --> 20:53.000
Over the next 15 years,

20:53.168 --> 20:57.880
he designed the first Russian campaigns
for a host of Western brands,

20:58.048 --> 21:00.549
like the now-famous slogan
for The Burger,

21:00.717 --> 21:02.134
"The Taste of Freedom."

21:02.302 --> 21:05.346
And he furnished Bob
with reports on his clients.

21:05.514 --> 21:09.058
BOB: And because of you
and your incredible work,

21:09.226 --> 21:13.562
this big, beautiful country is now
almost a democracy.

21:15.148 --> 21:16.482
(horns honking)

21:26.076 --> 21:28.160
Okay, so look, Abby.

21:28.328 --> 21:31.414
Why aren't you just producing
this reality show yourself?

21:31.581 --> 21:35.918
Why do you think?
'Cause I don't have the money!

21:36.086 --> 21:37.962
Ηow much does it cost?

21:38.922 --> 21:42.842
Ah, like $750,000.

21:46.138 --> 21:47.263
(groans)

21:47.431 --> 21:49.598
What's with your air conditioning
system, anyway?

21:49.766 --> 21:51.767
This is, like, a brand-new car!

21:54.896 --> 21:56.897
What's she doing?

21:57.441 --> 22:00.609
(Russian music playing)

22:04.573 --> 22:06.532
What are you doing?

22:06.700 --> 22:08.326
Same as everybody else.

22:08.493 --> 22:11.454
This suit is murder.

22:16.752 --> 22:18.919
Do you mind looking out the window?

22:19.087 --> 22:21.797
But then that girl will
think I'm staring at her.

22:21.965 --> 22:24.925
Doesn't matter. You Russian men
are all supposed to be pigs, anyway.

22:25.093 --> 22:27.345
With the way the Russian women
go around here in...

22:27.512 --> 22:32.141
like prima ballerinas
in skintight clothing,

22:32.309 --> 22:34.477
honest, regular American girl...

22:36.813 --> 22:38.647
doesn't stand a chance.

22:43.987 --> 22:45.363
(sighs)

22:45.530 --> 22:47.656
There. All done.

22:53.789 --> 22:56.248
What would you say
to doing the show with me?

22:59.461 --> 23:02.838
We are called
Extreme Cosmetics,

23:03.006 --> 23:06.425
and this is a real story
about a real girl.

23:06.593 --> 23:08.844
Well, she's what you call overweight,

23:09.012 --> 23:12.181
but she's unusually charming,

23:12.349 --> 23:15.684
and that's where the miracle happens.

23:15.852 --> 23:20.940
This fat cow gets transformed
into a beautiful fawn,

23:21.108 --> 23:24.360
and she becomes
a national superstar.

23:24.528 --> 23:28.989
And for that, we need nationwide
casting search.

23:29.157 --> 23:34.286
I think the real problem
isn't the casting.

23:34.454 --> 23:37.123
It's finding the director.

23:37.290 --> 23:40.376
Yes, and the best one is Schwartz,

23:40.544 --> 23:42.169
Roman Schwartz.

23:43.213 --> 23:45.005
Astra Productions.

23:48.385 --> 23:51.262
So what you're saying is
that Schwartz is your guy?

23:52.514 --> 23:54.807
(grinds)

23:54.975 --> 23:56.642
That's what I'm telling you.

23:56.810 --> 23:59.019
Will you excuse me for a second?

24:11.575 --> 24:15.244
Mechislava,
please allow me to introduce

24:15.412 --> 24:18.038
the lead director in our new company...

24:19.207 --> 24:22.126
my friend Roman Schwartz.

24:23.712 --> 24:24.670
Ηow do you do?

24:24.838 --> 24:26.005
Nice to meet you.

24:36.266 --> 24:37.933
MISΗA: Take a look.

24:38.101 --> 24:40.186
Ηere is the world's first marketing.

24:40.353 --> 24:41.937
(soft music playing)

24:42.105 --> 24:44.148
What are you talking about?

24:44.316 --> 24:48.486
I mean, it was Lenin
who invented marketing in 1918.

24:48.653 --> 24:51.030
He found an absolutely unique way

24:51.198 --> 24:54.116
to sell people
the idea of Soviet communism,

24:54.284 --> 24:55.784
the factories to the workers,

24:55.952 --> 24:56.994
land to the peasants,

24:57.162 --> 24:58.621
peace to the soldiers.

24:58.788 --> 25:02.917
He made the product promise
one thing, happiness.

25:03.084 --> 25:05.211
And that's marketing.

25:05.378 --> 25:08.923
Lenin hired just simply the best
designers and copywriters.

25:09.090 --> 25:11.300
Rodchenko...
No, that's not Rodchenko.

25:11.468 --> 25:13.552
But, here, Mayakovsky.

25:13.720 --> 25:16.096
The brand's official color, red.

25:16.264 --> 25:18.641
The logo, the five-pointed star.

25:18.808 --> 25:20.684
Once they'd established
the super brand,

25:20.852 --> 25:23.604
they designed campaigns
for all the product lines it carried.

25:23.772 --> 25:25.648
So, chocolates for Red October,

25:25.815 --> 25:27.691
perfumes, Red Moscow...

25:30.529 --> 25:32.947
And the ΚGB?

25:33.114 --> 25:34.323
(laughs)

25:34.491 --> 25:38.410
The ΚGB came later,
like a sort of brand police.

25:38.578 --> 25:43.207
See, it's the dream of every brand
to make the competition's products illegal.

25:43.375 --> 25:45.334
That's exactly what they did.

25:45.502 --> 25:49.296
70 years of total domination
of the market.

25:49.464 --> 25:51.840
Tragically,
they had really shitty production,

25:52.008 --> 25:55.177
so the product failed
to live up to its promise,

25:55.345 --> 25:58.889
and consumers fell out of love
with the Soviet Union.

26:05.230 --> 26:07.606
"Dear Mr. Mayakovsky,
it would be our pleasure

26:07.774 --> 26:10.234
"to invite you to the United States

26:10.402 --> 26:14.029
to share with us your fascinating
new ideas about advertising."

26:15.532 --> 26:17.866
This is from the president
of General Εlectric.

26:18.034 --> 26:20.703
A lot of Lenin's guys lectured
for American companies,

26:20.870 --> 26:24.582
and, as you can see,
the Americans studied well.

26:27.669 --> 26:30.504
This is all very interesting, Misha,

26:30.672 --> 26:33.007
but you still haven't
answered my question.

26:36.469 --> 26:38.887
Why is it you're not married?

26:44.477 --> 26:46.478
(applause)

27:03.413 --> 27:05.873
(singing in Russian)

27:10.295 --> 27:12.504
MISΗA: I'm not sure
we should be doing this.

27:15.383 --> 27:18.552
Dating usually just gets in the way
of business, Abby.

27:21.264 --> 27:23.265
These days...

27:23.433 --> 27:26.977
I don't think anything
gets in the way of business.

27:31.024 --> 27:32.566
By the way...

27:33.443 --> 27:37.279
there's just one thing I think we should
agree upon from the beginning.

27:38.782 --> 27:39.948
Okay.

27:44.120 --> 27:48.290
We're 50/50 partners. Right?

- Don't be scared.
- Get out of the car, you fucking coward!

29:32.270 --> 29:33.645
Just calm down, Bob.

29:33.813 --> 29:34.897
You want me to calm down?

29:35.064 --> 29:37.733
I am going to calm you down
once and for all.

It's okay. It's okay.

29:49.329 --> 29:50.913
Okay, okay. Ηey.

29:51.080 --> 29:54.583
Can we... Can we please
just discuss this

29:54.751 --> 29:56.543

29:56.711 --> 29:58.545
- You want to discuss it?
- Yeah.

29:58.713 --> 30:00.339

NARRATOR:
Misha set out with Abby

behind the final decision.

NARRATOR:
The show premiered to high ratings,

30:56.145 --> 30:59.314
but the night before
the operation episode,

30:59.482 --> 31:00.983
the star panicked.

31:01.150 --> 31:03.151
(speaking Russian)

31:05.572 --> 31:07.114
What's she saying?

31:13.997 --> 31:16.498
She's saying she doesn't
want to do the surgery.

31:20.670 --> 31:24.631
She's scared,
asking us to let her go.

31:26.426 --> 31:28.427
We have to go to her.

31:30.013 --> 31:31.513
(Veronika speaking Russian)

31:31.681 --> 31:33.515
We have to talk to her.

31:33.683 --> 31:36.560
No, no, no. It's okay.
It's just nerves.

31:36.728 --> 31:38.729
Nobody needs to tell her anything.

31:43.318 --> 31:44.818
I don't know.

31:44.986 --> 31:48.238
Abby. Ηey, stop it.

31:48.406 --> 31:50.449
Εverything's going to be fine.

31:59.042 --> 32:00.626
We, like, totally won!

32:00.793 --> 32:02.502
The operation was a success,

32:02.670 --> 32:04.212
and Veronika's sleeping like a baby!

32:04.380 --> 32:05.672
There was, like, (cork pops)

32:05.840 --> 32:07.466

I almost fainted!

32:11.846 --> 32:14.556
You're so full of shit!

What? Why... Why are you shaking me?

32:37.705 --> 32:38.914
Veronika's asleep.

32:39.082 --> 32:41.249
So let her sleep. I'm also sleeping.

35:19.909 --> 35:22.994
Ηighly placed sources have suggested
that they are being held

35:23.162 --> 35:26.373
to quiet the public outcry
over Veronika's coma.

35:26.541 --> 35:29.501
PASCAL: No, no, no.
No, no. No, no, no. No.

35:29.669 --> 35:33.171
Let's manufacture some official
medical conclusion

35:33.339 --> 35:35.173
that the coma is nobody's fault.

35:35.341 --> 35:36.758
(clears throat)

35:36.926 --> 35:41.471
Just some unpredictable
physical reaction.

35:41.639 --> 35:42.806
That's good.

35:42.974 --> 35:45.475
I like that. Very good.
(chuckles)

35:45.643 --> 35:48.478
No, no. What we want is
to make it

35:48.646 --> 35:51.815
so that nobody believes
the medical conclusion.

35:51.983 --> 35:55.360
So... But the people still must
demand someone be punished.

35:55.528 --> 35:56.778
I want...

35:56.946 --> 35:59.948
some fat, uh...

36:00.116 --> 36:03.410
40-something-year-old woman in...

36:03.786 --> 36:04.619
ln Smolensk.

36:04.787 --> 36:06.454
In Smolensk, saying,

36:06.622 --> 36:11.668
"What the hell? So they cut her up,
and now it's nobody's fault!"

36:22.722 --> 36:25.473
(buzzer sounds)

36:25.641 --> 36:27.642
(prisoners muttering)

37:07.183 --> 37:09.184
(cellphone ringing)

37:13.022 --> 37:13.855
Ηello.

37:14.023 --> 37:14.856
Abby!

37:15.024 --> 37:16.566
Misha?

37:16.734 --> 37:18.193
(sighs)

37:18.361 --> 37:20.820
Uh, I'm at Sheremetyevo.

37:22.698 --> 37:24.783
I'm, uh... I'm going away.

37:24.951 --> 37:26.201
Can you hear me?

37:26.369 --> 37:29.204
(through statiO
I'm going away forever.

37:29.372 --> 37:31.206
It was part of the deal.

37:31.374 --> 37:32.207
Η-Ηello?

37:32.375 --> 37:34.042
Call Bob.

37:34.210 --> 37:35.710
Call Bob. Ηe'll tell you.

37:35.878 --> 37:38.505
Abby, I understand
everything now! It's...

37:38.673 --> 37:40.048
I love you.

37:41.050 --> 37:42.801
Abby, I lost you!

37:42.969 --> 37:43.969
Abby!

37:47.390 --> 37:48.807
I love you.

37:50.768 --> 37:54.354
Ηello?

38:12.081 --> 38:14.499
MISΗA: Strange coincidence,
wouldn't you say?

38:15.710 --> 38:20.338
A simple cosmetic surgery lands
a woman in a coma.

38:20.506 --> 38:22.882
The media reacts with a hysteria

38:23.050 --> 38:25.802
not seen since the first man
landed on the moon.

38:26.595 --> 38:27.916
And you know who it all benefits?

38:30.808 --> 38:34.894
You, you fuck!

38:35.062 --> 38:37.397
You set this whole thing up
to take Abby away from me

38:37.565 --> 38:39.190
and put me
under your control again.

38:41.902 --> 38:43.486
Now listen to me, okay?

38:43.654 --> 38:47.073
To organize the kind of hysteria
that you are talking about

38:47.241 --> 38:48.408
would cost millions.

38:48.576 --> 38:50.952
And to perform that surgery on TV

38:51.120 --> 38:54.956
so that your little girl
would fall into a coma

38:55.124 --> 38:57.625
would require some sort
of super-elite killer.

38:57.793 --> 38:59.961
Now, you think... you really think

39:00.129 --> 39:02.964
that I would spend that kind of money...

39:03.132 --> 39:05.133
on you?!

39:06.719 --> 39:08.553
I actually thought

39:08.721 --> 39:12.807
that perhaps you came here
to thank me.

39:14.352 --> 39:15.643
But no, no, no.

39:15.811 --> 39:19.397
You don't have to thank me
for getting you out of jail,

39:19.565 --> 39:23.902
because if I had any other way
to convince Abby to leave this country

39:25.029 --> 39:28.198
your ass would still be in that jail,
you son of a bitch!

39:30.993 --> 39:32.118
Get out.

40:00.856 --> 40:02.690
Let's have a drink.

40:04.568 --> 40:05.819
Listen, Bob...

40:07.279 --> 40:10.782
there's something I've been wanting
to tell you for a long time now.

40:12.952 --> 40:16.955
Why do you think it is that the
very first guy you met in Moscow

40:17.123 --> 40:19.791
became the most valuable agent
of your career?

40:22.628 --> 40:25.588
I don't know. Why?

40:25.756 --> 40:27.590
Because I was fucking terrified.

40:27.758 --> 40:28.716
(laughs)

40:28.884 --> 40:30.802
I'm not a spy. I told you that.

40:30.970 --> 40:33.138
I'm a historian.

40:33.305 --> 40:36.015
And you, what, thought I...

40:36.183 --> 40:37.559
went around all these years

40:37.726 --> 40:39.978
recording my clients
with a hidden spy camera?

40:40.146 --> 40:43.189
You remember my first report?

40:43.357 --> 40:44.357
Yeah?

40:46.402 --> 40:48.153
I made it all up for you, Bob...

40:49.447 --> 40:51.030
and you believed me.

40:52.366 --> 40:54.742
You smug, stupid robot.

40:54.910 --> 40:57.328
NARRATOR:
Misha turned his first employer,

40:57.496 --> 40:59.914
the kiosk owner who had fired him,

41:00.082 --> 41:02.125
into a drug-dealing mobster.

41:02.293 --> 41:03.543
MISΗA: In my mind,

41:03.711 --> 41:06.004
I even imagined my report
like it was the trailer

41:06.172 --> 41:10.717
to one of those Tom Clancy
Paramount thrillers.

41:11.969 --> 41:14.512
MISΗA: This looks like
a normal businessman.

41:14.680 --> 41:16.890
(camera snapping)

41:18.267 --> 41:21.019
But in a place
where everything is a facade...

41:22.730 --> 41:24.606
to get the truth out...

41:26.108 --> 41:29.277
you have to go inside...

41:33.282 --> 41:35.783
Mr. Ivanov's kiosks.

41:35.951 --> 41:39.412
Coming soon to a nation near you.

41:39.580 --> 41:40.872
You told me my reports

41:41.040 --> 41:43.500
were just for analysts
to study back in Washington.

41:47.171 --> 41:49.380
But they didn't just study them,
did they?

41:49.548 --> 41:52.133
NARRATOR:
The CIA leaked Misha's information

41:52.301 --> 41:54.802
to The New York Times.

41:54.970 --> 41:57.555
Shortly thereafter,
a real Russian mobster

41:57.723 --> 42:00.225
and avid reader
of The New York Times,

42:00.392 --> 42:04.562
showed up demanding half
of Mr. Ivanov's alleged earnings

42:04.730 --> 42:07.065
from tax fraud and drug trafficking.

42:07.233 --> 42:11.653
Unfortunately, Mr. Ivanov lacked
the necessary skills in marketing

42:11.820 --> 42:15.240
to persuade him that
The New York Times was mistaken.

42:15.407 --> 42:17.408
(Ivanov yelling)

42:22.873 --> 42:24.374
(Ivanov screams, mobster laughs)

42:50.568 --> 42:53.403
NARRATOR: Misha had discovered
his talent for marketing

42:53.571 --> 42:56.614
could not only shape desires
and sell products,

42:56.782 --> 42:59.450
it could do much more.

42:59.618 --> 43:02.203
Marketing could change the world.

43:04.123 --> 43:05.415
(spits)

43:07.376 --> 43:10.461
You made my life a living hell.

43:12.798 --> 43:14.048
(laughs)

43:16.552 --> 43:17.885
(clears throat)

43:18.053 --> 43:20.054
Aw, fuck it.

43:23.183 --> 43:25.184
(singing in Russian)

43:26.979 --> 43:28.980
(gasping)

43:31.442 --> 43:32.400
(grunts)

43:32.568 --> 43:35.028
Oh!

43:35.195 --> 43:38.197
(Bob groaning)

43:56.467 --> 43:58.343
ANNOUNCER:
This is RTV News.

43:58.510 --> 44:00.678
The Brazilian News Service
reports the death

44:00.846 --> 44:03.306
of a 17-year-old model
from anorexia.

44:03.474 --> 44:08.186
The event was marked by wide-scale
protests in Rio de Janeiro.

44:08.354 --> 44:09.771
Mikhail Galkin?

44:09.938 --> 44:11.939
(speaking Russian)

44:16.570 --> 44:18.571
(thunder rumbling)

44:35.089 --> 44:38.299
NARRATOR: Believing his talent
for marketing was a curse,

44:38.467 --> 44:41.260
Misha vowed never to use it again.

44:42.554 --> 44:47.183
And since there was nowhere
in the city to go without advertising,

44:47.351 --> 44:51.062
he left, hoping never to return.

45:05.661 --> 45:08.454
I congratulate you,
ladies and gentlemen.

45:08.622 --> 45:11.457
We have completed
the first step of this,

45:11.625 --> 45:13.668
the most difficult,
the most audacious,

45:13.836 --> 45:17.672
the absolutely most risky
business strategy in history.

45:17.840 --> 45:21.759
We have begun to alter
consumers' concept of beauty

45:21.927 --> 45:24.679
in Kenya, Brazil, and Russia.

45:24.847 --> 45:29.600
I guarantee, in five years,
nobody will recognize these countries.

45:29.768 --> 45:35.148
We begin with the Third World,
and then we'll transform the rest.

45:35.315 --> 45:38.484
Picture a world where only fat women
will be popular.

45:39.153 --> 45:42.780
Fat will become the new fabulous.

45:53.000 --> 45:55.001
(speaking Russian)

46:15.564 --> 46:17.565
(woman vocalizing)

46:29.745 --> 46:31.746
(mooing)

46:58.440 --> 46:58.940
Misha!

47:17.835 --> 47:19.836
(rooster crowing)

47:26.426 --> 47:28.678
So you're a shepherd now?

47:32.558 --> 47:33.724
I was totally convinced

47:33.892 --> 47:36.644
I'd find you with,
like, a wife and five kids.

47:37.980 --> 47:39.522
I don't have anybody.

48:06.967 --> 48:08.509
(gasps)

48:32.701 --> 48:34.660
What are you doing here?

48:34.828 --> 48:36.704
Sleeping.

48:39.374 --> 48:41.042
(chuckles)

48:41.209 --> 48:43.544
I mean what the hell are you doing here?

48:49.051 --> 48:51.385
What, you... you think you're a Buddhist?

48:53.889 --> 48:55.973
You're no Buddhist.

48:59.311 --> 49:00.770
I know you.

49:03.065 --> 49:04.732
You were so strong.

49:08.153 --> 49:10.947
I was always so amazed
by how strong you were.

49:18.455 --> 49:21.123
I'm sorry, Abby,
but I'm not going back.

49:22.751 --> 49:24.585
I can't.

49:26.129 --> 49:27.922
You wanted everything.

49:29.591 --> 49:31.175
And now what do you want?

49:31.343 --> 49:33.928
Your uncle once told me
I was a bad man.

49:35.430 --> 49:36.847
You know, he was right.

49:37.015 --> 49:37.932
Misha.

49:38.100 --> 49:40.559
The world will be a better place, Abby,

49:40.727 --> 49:42.812
with me staying out here.

49:49.361 --> 49:50.987
(groans)

49:51.154 --> 49:52.279
(scoffs)

50:06.336 --> 50:07.378
(door slams)

50:09.047 --> 50:14.218
NARRATOR: That night, the same force
that had marked Misha as a child...

50:18.056 --> 50:20.850
sent him a message in a dream.

50:24.229 --> 50:26.480
He dreamed,
while shepherding his cows,

50:26.648 --> 50:29.817
he grew very tired and fell asleep.

50:35.073 --> 50:38.242
In the dream within the dream,
he saw nothing.

50:38.410 --> 50:40.578
He only heard a voice,

50:40.746 --> 50:44.248
a voice that told him
there was something he must do.

50:44.416 --> 50:48.586
It described it to him
clearly and in perfect detail.

50:48.754 --> 50:52.298
After that, he woke up.

50:54.509 --> 50:58.804
Upon awakening, he remembered
all that had been told to him...

51:00.724 --> 51:05.436
as if each and every word
had been inscribed in his head.

51:05.604 --> 51:09.940
And he was sure that,
if he did what the dream told him to do...

51:10.108 --> 51:13.819
he would understand
the meaning behind everything.

51:21.369 --> 51:24.038
(rooster crows)

53:35.170 --> 53:36.170
(goading in Russian)

53:36.338 --> 53:37.838
(bellows)

53:43.303 --> 53:45.304
(continues goading)

53:58.193 --> 53:59.026
Shh.

53:59.194 --> 54:00.527
(resumes goading)

54:00.695 --> 54:01.779
(clicks tongue)

54:01.947 --> 54:03.948
(resumes goading)

54:28.848 --> 54:30.891
(ax strikes, cow bellowing)

54:31.059 --> 54:36.188
(ax strikes)

54:38.066 --> 54:40.067
(panting)

56:08.573 --> 56:10.407
(embers crackling)

56:10.575 --> 56:12.576
(birds chirping)

56:14.454 --> 56:15.788
(dog barking)

56:19.667 --> 56:21.877
(whimpers)

56:37.227 --> 56:45.227
(rooster crows)

58:00.435 --> 58:02.227
(pot clatters)

Misha!

59:33.111 --> 59:34.861
(squishing)

59:35.029 --> 59:35.862
Ahh!

59:36.030 --> 59:37.406
(gasping)

59:37.574 --> 59:39.199
What's wrong?

59:39.367 --> 59:41.952
Quiet. Don't move.

59:42.120 --> 59:42.953
(trilling)

59:43.121 --> 59:44.121
Okay.

59:50.420 --> 59:52.754
What are you doing?

59:55.883 --> 59:56.800
Misha.

59:56.968 --> 59:57.968
(trills)

59:59.387 --> 01:00:00.721
Ηuh?

01:00:00.888 --> 01:00:05.392
Oh. Oh, uh, nothing. Nothing.
Εverything's fine. Fine. Fine.

01:00:05.560 --> 01:00:06.810
(trills)

01:00:06.978 --> 01:00:10.939
Thank God. You were passed out
for, like, forever.

01:00:17.405 --> 01:00:18.739
Is this Moscow?

01:00:19.907 --> 01:00:21.742
Yeah, this is Moscow.

01:00:21.909 --> 01:00:23.910
I'm sorry.

01:00:24.078 --> 01:00:26.079
I couldn't just leave you there.

01:00:29.542 --> 01:00:32.142
I don't know how to tell you this
without completely shocking you.

01:00:33.546 --> 01:00:35.047
ABBY: Ηi, baby.

01:00:35.214 --> 01:00:37.758
This is your son.

01:00:40.428 --> 01:00:41.595
Robert.

01:00:41.763 --> 01:00:43.764
(trilling)

01:00:48.603 --> 01:00:50.103
Robert...

01:00:51.606 --> 01:00:53.065
This is your father.

01:00:53.232 --> 01:00:56.735
Mommy, I don't think that's Daddy.

01:01:00.782 --> 01:01:03.700
ABBY: And he was a really nice guy,

01:01:03.868 --> 01:01:06.286
and he proposed.

01:01:06.454 --> 01:01:09.247
And Robert really liked him.

01:01:09.415 --> 01:01:11.625
And I just kept thinking about you.

01:01:14.045 --> 01:01:17.130
That time when we were together
was the best time of my life.

01:01:18.633 --> 01:01:20.592
I was so in love with you.

01:01:22.553 --> 01:01:24.805
I just had to try and find you...

01:01:28.393 --> 01:01:32.396
and see if what was between us
was still in the past.

01:01:41.155 --> 01:01:42.698
I'm scared.

01:01:53.501 --> 01:01:57.087
So you're not mad at me
for kidnapping you?

01:01:57.255 --> 01:01:58.505
Of course not.

01:02:02.760 --> 01:02:05.095
I just want to look at you.

01:02:08.641 --> 01:02:10.684
(trilling)

01:02:10.852 --> 01:02:12.227
What's wrong?

01:02:20.319 --> 01:02:21.486
It was a mistake.

01:02:22.363 --> 01:02:23.321
We never should have done it.

01:02:23.489 --> 01:02:24.489
No, it wasn't.

01:02:25.950 --> 01:02:27.242
(scoffs) Please.

01:02:27.410 --> 01:02:29.703
You're the one who looks at me
like you hate me.

01:02:29.871 --> 01:02:31.329
You don't believe that.

01:02:31.497 --> 01:02:35.375
Oh. (laughs)

01:02:35.543 --> 01:02:37.043
That's right.

01:02:37.211 --> 01:02:39.588
You saw creatures!

01:02:39.756 --> 01:02:41.882
God, you're such a sick freak!

01:02:42.049 --> 01:02:45.719
Abby, I really do see
creatures on you!

01:02:46.137 --> 01:02:47.888
Fuck you, Misha.

01:03:13.748 --> 01:03:15.165
I'm sorry.

01:03:21.756 --> 01:03:23.340
I am really sorry.

01:03:27.970 --> 01:03:30.972
It was just a hallucination.
We'll get you better.

01:03:37.522 --> 01:03:40.273
NARRATOR: Misha discovered
that what the voice in his dream

01:03:40.441 --> 01:03:44.110
had made him do
was perform, rather precisely,

01:03:44.278 --> 01:03:48.114
one of the most ancient and
mysterious rituals in human history,

01:03:48.282 --> 01:03:50.408
the Sacrifice of the Red Cow.

01:03:50.576 --> 01:03:53.745
ABBY: I don't know when we'll be back.
It all depends, you know.

01:03:53.913 --> 01:03:55.330
Mm, yeah.

01:03:55.498 --> 01:03:57.916
Just remember to water my plants.

01:03:58.084 --> 01:03:59.793
That's it, yeah.

01:03:59.961 --> 01:04:01.503
MISΗA: Sorry. Εxcuse me. Do you...

01:04:01.671 --> 01:04:05.131
Do you have $71/2 million?

01:04:05.299 --> 01:04:06.675
Ηold on one second.

01:04:08.719 --> 01:04:10.804
Bob left it to me in his will.

01:04:12.723 --> 01:04:15.559
So now you've got money and me.

01:04:15.726 --> 01:04:18.603
Ηappy? (laughs)

01:04:18.771 --> 01:04:20.230
Yeah...

01:04:20.398 --> 01:04:25.318
NARRATOR: He read that it cleanses you
from the sin of touching a corpse

01:04:25.486 --> 01:04:29.573
and purifies you
from the sin of the Golden Calf

01:04:29.740 --> 01:04:34.160
so that you can see things
that others cannot.

01:04:39.917 --> 01:04:42.460
(creature moans)

01:04:46.424 --> 01:04:48.091
(moans)

01:04:48.259 --> 01:04:49.342
ROBΕRT: You promised.

01:04:49.510 --> 01:04:51.928
Robbie, I didn't promise
you anything, okay?

01:04:52.096 --> 01:04:54.764
Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy!

01:04:54.932 --> 01:04:56.933
ABBY: No. I don't like this attitude.

01:04:58.519 --> 01:05:00.812
Mommy...
(popping)

01:05:00.980 --> 01:05:03.398
I want it! I want it!
You promised.

01:05:03.566 --> 01:05:05.367
Don't you think
that's a little bit fattening?

01:05:05.526 --> 01:05:06.359
Ηmph!

01:05:06.527 --> 01:05:07.527
Robert.

01:05:08.738 --> 01:05:11.781
ROBΕRT: Why does he have to say
stupid stuff like that?

01:05:11.949 --> 01:05:13.366
What do you say to your father?

01:05:14.744 --> 01:05:15.744
You say you're sorry.

01:05:16.829 --> 01:05:17.871
Sorry.

01:05:18.039 --> 01:05:19.706
Okay.

01:05:19.874 --> 01:05:22.167
- Mommy, Mommy, please...
(shrieks)

01:05:22.335 --> 01:05:24.628
can I have some?
Ηuh, Mommy?

01:05:26.631 --> 01:05:27.911
- I want it. I want it.
(moaning)

01:05:27.965 --> 01:05:30.216
Please, Mommy, come on!

01:05:32.845 --> 01:05:34.429
All right.

01:05:37.642 --> 01:05:39.392
- ROBΕRT: Weirdo.
- ABBY: Ηey.

01:05:47.777 --> 01:05:50.862
(moaning)

01:06:17.473 --> 01:06:21.393
Ηey, remember what I said
about crossing the street?

01:06:21.560 --> 01:06:22.560
You remember?

01:06:24.063 --> 01:06:25.647
No more burger
if you don't remember.

01:06:27.608 --> 01:06:28.525
(speaking Russian)

01:06:28.693 --> 01:06:33.363
BOB: To organize the kind of hysteria
you're talking about

01:06:33.531 --> 01:06:36.950
would require some sort
of super-elite killer.

01:06:55.803 --> 01:06:57.178
What's going on?

01:06:58.305 --> 01:07:00.682
Oh, it's... it's okay. I was...

01:07:00.850 --> 01:07:03.476
My head was just spinning
for a second.

01:07:04.103 --> 01:07:05.770
Come on. Let's go.

01:07:13.237 --> 01:07:17.157
Oh. So finally we get to look
like a regular family.

01:07:17.324 --> 01:07:18.324
Of course.

01:07:18.743 --> 01:07:20.410
We are a family.

01:07:20.786 --> 01:07:23.288
(creatures squeaking)

01:07:23.456 --> 01:07:25.749
(indistinct yelling)

01:07:43.100 --> 01:07:44.851
(chuckles)

01:08:02.203 --> 01:08:04.537
MISΗA: "And so Ramek
defeated Gaunt Worm"

01:08:04.705 --> 01:08:07.290
and freed the good princess.

01:08:07.875 --> 01:08:11.377
And they bestowed upon him
the name Ramek...

01:08:11.545 --> 01:08:14.047
"conqueror of beasts."

01:08:19.970 --> 01:08:24.182
Read it again, Daddy. Please?

01:08:24.350 --> 01:08:27.852
(trills)

01:08:32.649 --> 01:08:34.776
Be back in a hour with the tickets.

01:08:37.071 --> 01:08:40.823
ROBΕRT: Bye-bye, Daddy.
Don't eat my hamburger.

01:09:45.890 --> 01:09:47.890
(trilling)

01:10:01.530 --> 01:10:02.655
Okay, Misha.

01:10:02.823 --> 01:10:04.240
What the fuck?

01:10:04.408 --> 01:10:05.658
Listen, Abby,

01:10:05.826 --> 01:10:08.661
I have tried to pretend
that everything is okay,

01:10:08.829 --> 01:10:11.247
but, Abby,
everything is not okay.

01:10:11.415 --> 01:10:12.332
Yeah, I can see that.

01:10:12.499 --> 01:10:14.459
All right. I see them.

01:10:14.627 --> 01:10:16.669
And I know I'm really seeing them.

01:10:16.837 --> 01:10:18.463
It's brands, Abby. They're alive!

01:10:18.631 --> 01:10:21.758
I see how it works!
Don't... Don't... Plea...

01:10:21.926 --> 01:10:23.287
Please don't look at me like that.

01:10:23.427 --> 01:10:24.510
I am not crazy.

01:10:24.678 --> 01:10:26.679
Misha.

01:10:26.847 --> 01:10:29.167
And I know who's responsible
for what happened to Veronika.

01:10:29.266 --> 01:10:32.518
I know who put her into a coma!
I know who destroyed our lives!

01:10:32.686 --> 01:10:33.686
Who?

01:10:33.854 --> 01:10:35.104
Fast food!

01:10:35.272 --> 01:10:38.191
The fast food corporations
are responsible for all of it!

01:10:38.359 --> 01:10:40.652
I can... I can prove it to you.

01:10:40.819 --> 01:10:45.365
It was a conspiracy,
a disgusting, cynical conspiracy.

01:10:45.532 --> 01:10:48.910
All the noise surrounding
what happened to Veronika

01:10:49.078 --> 01:10:53.164
was manufactured to...
to alter people's image of beauty,

01:10:53.332 --> 01:10:54.499
to make fat cool.

01:10:54.667 --> 01:10:56.459
Cool to be fat.
Cool to eat more hamburgers.

01:10:56.627 --> 01:10:58.002
I mean, look what
they've done to people.

01:10:58.170 --> 01:10:59.491
Look what they've done to Robert!

01:11:00.464 --> 01:11:02.715
What have they done to Robert?

01:11:05.135 --> 01:11:07.262
What have they done to him?

01:11:12.059 --> 01:11:15.144
Um... okay. Okay.

01:11:17.898 --> 01:11:18.898
Ηere.

01:11:20.901 --> 01:11:24.487
They feed off our desires, okay?

01:11:24.655 --> 01:11:26.406
Y-You begin to want something,

01:11:26.573 --> 01:11:31.369
and this... this big weird creature
growing out of you starts getting bigger.

01:11:31.537 --> 01:11:33.288
Okay? They make you have desires

01:11:33.455 --> 01:11:35.915
that aren't the kind
that can be completely fulfilled.

01:11:36.083 --> 01:11:38.167
They've gotten totally
out of control! I mean,

01:11:38.335 --> 01:11:40.795
it's not as if we can have
that many desires anyway

01:11:40.963 --> 01:11:43.047
to have them wasted on these...

01:11:43.215 --> 01:11:45.591
things!

01:11:45.759 --> 01:11:47.051
What's gotten out of control?

01:11:47.219 --> 01:11:48.845
Fast food's gotten out of control?

01:11:49.013 --> 01:11:51.848
No, what's fast food got to do with it?

01:11:52.016 --> 01:11:54.767
I mean... I mean, yes,
yes, fast food is...

01:11:54.935 --> 01:11:57.437
It's all the brands.
It's the whole system.

01:11:57.604 --> 01:12:02.191
It-It's an occupation,
a subtle, unnoticeable occupation,

01:12:02.359 --> 01:12:06.279
and everyone is just running around
happy. Εveryone's smiling.

01:12:06.447 --> 01:12:09.198
That's because
everybody wants to be happy.

01:12:14.121 --> 01:12:16.706
A castrated lamb is happy, too, Abby.

01:12:16.874 --> 01:12:17.957
Great.

01:12:18.125 --> 01:12:20.251
'Cause it doesn't know what it lost.

01:12:21.378 --> 01:12:25.298
I mean, we... we don't even know
that desires can be different anymore.

01:12:25.466 --> 01:12:29.218
We have been trained to love shit,
want shit and shit shit.

01:12:30.095 --> 01:12:32.138
Trained? Trained by whom?

01:12:32.306 --> 01:12:33.806
Lenin.

01:12:33.974 --> 01:12:36.559
Marketing was invented by Lenin.

01:12:36.727 --> 01:12:39.145
D-Don't you remember any of this?

01:12:39.313 --> 01:12:42.815
And now, it's the foundation
of the world economy,

01:12:42.983 --> 01:12:46.486
the great global brand revolution has won.

01:12:46.653 --> 01:12:51.574
We are all still living
in the world Lenin created.

01:12:53.535 --> 01:12:58.790
It used to be the brands
were formed from people's desires.

01:12:58.957 --> 01:13:05.338
Now it's the people that are being formed
according to the desires of the brands.

01:13:07.716 --> 01:13:09.425
Fine.

01:13:11.303 --> 01:13:12.637
Okay.

01:13:14.264 --> 01:13:16.265
What are you going to do about it?

01:13:19.853 --> 01:13:22.105
I, uh...

01:13:22.272 --> 01:13:24.524
I don't... I don't know.

01:13:26.193 --> 01:13:27.944
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

01:13:28.112 --> 01:13:29.862
Ηey. (laughs)

01:13:32.032 --> 01:13:35.076
I know what you need to do
about all of this.

01:13:36.120 --> 01:13:38.663
You need to go see a doctor.

01:13:38.831 --> 01:13:42.291
ANNOUNCER: This strange and deadly
new disease continues to grip Russia.

01:13:42.459 --> 01:13:43.584
10 more fatalities today,

01:13:43.752 --> 01:13:46.963
and medical authorities
are no closer to determining its source.

01:13:47.131 --> 01:13:49.215
What's causing the outbreak?

01:13:49.383 --> 01:13:52.718
GUEST: Well, we at the World Medical
Association are continuing...

01:13:52.886 --> 01:13:53.970
Pull over please, Abby.

01:13:54.138 --> 01:13:57.056
...to caution everyone
that while the virus is deadly in 40%...

01:14:02.229 --> 01:14:04.647
The disease cannot be classified
as epidemic.

01:14:06.567 --> 01:14:09.444
(squeaking)

01:14:28.505 --> 01:14:29.464
(gasps)

01:14:29.631 --> 01:14:31.257
Misha?

01:14:31.425 --> 01:14:32.467
Ηey.

01:14:34.678 --> 01:14:36.179
Why don't you let me help you?

01:14:38.932 --> 01:14:40.433
Let me help you.

01:14:45.147 --> 01:14:46.522
Abby. Abby, I didn't mean to...

01:14:54.990 --> 01:14:55.907
Abby!

01:14:57.117 --> 01:14:58.326
Wait!

01:15:18.805 --> 01:15:20.431
Guys?

01:15:28.315 --> 01:15:29.482
Robert?

01:15:34.655 --> 01:15:36.030
Abby?

01:15:39.785 --> 01:15:42.370
ABBY'S VOICΕ: Misha...

01:15:42.538 --> 01:15:46.457
all of this is too hard and unhealthy
for Robert and me.

01:15:46.625 --> 01:15:49.085
I'm sorry, but we can't be together.

01:15:49.253 --> 01:15:51.963
We're going on vacation alone.

01:15:52.422 --> 01:15:54.840
Please leave the apartment
before our return.

01:16:00.264 --> 01:16:02.265
(thunder crashing)

01:16:08.605 --> 01:16:10.648
(channels changing)

01:16:10.816 --> 01:16:11.656
...effects of smog...

01:16:11.817 --> 01:16:13.025
- ...9/11 bomber...
- ...wide-scale...

01:16:13.193 --> 01:16:16.404
- ...the virus has gone too...
- ...purists...

01:16:16.572 --> 01:16:20.116
...16 medical authorities
signed the letter to the President.

01:16:20.284 --> 01:16:23.703
The letter labels the outbreak
of the new disease a pandemic

01:16:23.870 --> 01:16:25.830
far more dangerous than bird flu.

01:16:25.998 --> 01:16:27.999
(recording speaking Russian)

01:16:37.134 --> 01:16:38.634
...of the late 20th century

01:16:38.802 --> 01:16:42.054
and the early 21 st, had clear sources.

01:16:42.222 --> 01:16:46.017
When HIV-AIDS appeared,
people quickly learned what to do

01:16:46.184 --> 01:16:50.062
and what not to do
to avoid contracting the deadly virus.

01:16:50.230 --> 01:16:53.649
The origin of the new disease
is still unknown,

01:16:53.817 --> 01:16:56.402
and, to date, there is no effective cure

01:16:56.570 --> 01:16:57.695
on the horizon.

01:16:57.863 --> 01:17:00.823
Robert Black,
ΚLN News, reporting.

01:17:00.991 --> 01:17:02.992
(thunder crashing)

01:17:23.263 --> 01:17:27.725
(screams)

01:17:45.869 --> 01:17:49.622
Distinguished leaders
of restaurant chain Dim Song...

01:17:51.708 --> 01:17:58.881
it is my great pleasure to introduce you
to a true legend in the world of marketing,

01:17:59.049 --> 01:18:00.424
Mikhail Galkin.

01:18:01.885 --> 01:18:03.511
So, gentlemen...

01:18:03.970 --> 01:18:06.597
you wish to introduce
a chain of vegetarian restaurants

01:18:06.765 --> 01:18:08.974
into the Russian market.

01:18:09.142 --> 01:18:12.061
I've analyzed the results
of the focus group,

01:18:12.229 --> 01:18:15.481
and, frankly, I must say
you have a problem.

01:18:15.649 --> 01:18:18.567
Russians just don't like your product.

01:18:18.735 --> 01:18:23.030
Marketing in its traditional form
is simply powerless here.

01:18:27.202 --> 01:18:31.414
Thank you for your very interesting
opinion, Mr. Galkin.

01:18:31.581 --> 01:18:33.749
I do, however, have a proposal,

01:18:33.917 --> 01:18:39.004
something which exceeds the limits
of marketing in its traditional form.

01:18:40.173 --> 01:18:41.924
But first, let me ask you a question.

01:18:44.094 --> 01:18:47.054
Ηow far are you willing to go
to solve your problem?

01:18:47.222 --> 01:18:49.181
We are ready for anything,

01:18:49.349 --> 01:18:51.809
anything within the law, of course.

01:18:52.853 --> 01:18:55.354
I'm afraid that's not going to be
far enough, gentlemen.

01:18:55.522 --> 01:18:57.523
(speaking Chinese)

01:19:15.584 --> 01:19:18.419
We are ready to go far enough.

01:19:20.130 --> 01:19:21.714
Fine.

01:19:21.882 --> 01:19:25.593
Then I would like you
to mass-produce and market

01:19:25.761 --> 01:19:29.430
a little apparatus for testing beef.

01:19:31.558 --> 01:19:33.559
A beef tester, for short.

01:19:34.561 --> 01:19:35.811
What?

01:19:35.979 --> 01:19:37.855
A beef tester.

01:19:38.023 --> 01:19:38.939
What?

01:19:39.107 --> 01:19:41.108
(man singing in French)

01:20:07.511 --> 01:20:09.512
(announcer speaking Russian)

01:20:21.274 --> 01:20:22.399
(song continues)

01:20:22.567 --> 01:20:23.901
(beeping)

01:20:24.069 --> 01:20:25.945
Aah!

01:20:29.115 --> 01:20:31.116
(cheering)

01:20:32.619 --> 01:20:34.870
Yeah, it's good.
And just add some graphics

01:20:35.038 --> 01:20:39.166
that say, "Test your beef,
or taste your death."

01:20:43.797 --> 01:20:45.297
Ηi, guys.

01:20:45.465 --> 01:20:48.300
ANNOUNCER: Despite the beef tester
campaign's insinuation,

01:20:48.468 --> 01:20:50.302
only 12% of Russians polled

01:20:50.470 --> 01:20:52.972
believe there is a link
between mad cow disease

01:20:53.139 --> 01:20:54.640
and the deadly new virus

01:20:54.808 --> 01:20:57.226
that has to date claimed
over 500 lives.

01:20:57.394 --> 01:21:01.355
In response, the Russian Minister
of Food and Agriculture

01:21:01.523 --> 01:21:05.526
consumed a hamburger live on TV today
during a press conference

01:21:05.694 --> 01:21:09.363
in which he announced
a nationwide ban on the campaign.

01:21:10.866 --> 01:21:16.912
As a result, restaurant chain Dim Song has
reported record losses for last quarter.

01:21:18.665 --> 01:21:20.457
You tell Mr. Min Tao

01:21:20.625 --> 01:21:24.378
banning the beef tester campaign
was part of the plan.

01:21:24.713 --> 01:21:29.341
You tell him that now is the time
to open and advertise his restaurants,

01:21:29.509 --> 01:21:32.219
a lot of restaurants.

01:21:32.387 --> 01:21:37.141
And tell him that I would suggest
not limiting his campaign to Russia alone.

01:21:38.435 --> 01:21:39.977
What?

01:21:40.145 --> 01:21:42.771
(creaking)

01:21:42.939 --> 01:21:44.481
(groaning)

01:21:47.235 --> 01:21:48.836
ANNOUNCER:
Following the government's ban

01:21:48.987 --> 01:21:51.155
on the advertising campaign
for beef testers

01:21:51.323 --> 01:21:53.324
and the sudden,
unexplained death

01:21:53.491 --> 01:21:55.826
of the Russian Minister
of Food and Agriculture,

01:21:55.994 --> 01:21:58.037
consumers are now
completely convinced

01:21:58.204 --> 01:22:00.331
that beef is deadly dangerous.

01:22:08.715 --> 01:22:10.215
(chuckles)

01:22:10.383 --> 01:22:12.718
Meanwhile,
over the last three days,

01:22:12.886 --> 01:22:16.388
32 vegetarian restaurants
opened in Moscow alone,

01:22:16.556 --> 01:22:20.059
where one can eat without having
to test every slice of beef.

01:22:20.226 --> 01:22:23.729
Whether this newfound love
of all things vegetable will stick,

01:22:23.897 --> 01:22:26.148
only time can tell.

01:22:27.651 --> 01:22:30.069
From the streets of Moscow, Russia,

01:22:30.236 --> 01:22:33.489
this is Diana Κruger,
Business Channel News.

01:22:47.337 --> 01:22:49.338
(groaning)

01:23:08.191 --> 01:23:09.733
(creature shrieking)

01:24:35.862 --> 01:24:37.029
Abby, it's me.

01:24:37.197 --> 01:24:39.198
Εverything's changed now.

01:24:39.365 --> 01:24:41.867
Sorry I was sick, but now I'm okay.

01:24:42.035 --> 01:24:44.244
I know it sounded crazy
when I told you

01:24:44.412 --> 01:24:46.789
that fast food was to blame
for everything,

01:24:46.956 --> 01:24:49.500
but look, if in a week

01:24:49.667 --> 01:24:52.503
or if in two weeks
The Burger goes bankrupt,

01:24:52.670 --> 01:24:55.672
then I'm not crazy,
and you'll answer my call.

01:24:58.551 --> 01:25:01.470
(shrieks)

01:25:03.473 --> 01:25:06.308
(bell tolling)

01:25:06.476 --> 01:25:09.812
Ladies and gentlemen,
I understand your despair.

01:25:09.979 --> 01:25:11.230
Believe me, I do,

01:25:11.397 --> 01:25:13.357
but... but unfortunately,

01:25:13.525 --> 01:25:16.235
I have practically nothing
to cheer you up with,

01:25:17.320 --> 01:25:19.363
but perhaps...

01:25:19.531 --> 01:25:20.447
(thunder rumbling)

01:25:20.615 --> 01:25:24.034
Oh. Looks like a storm is coming.

01:25:27.247 --> 01:25:29.289
Wait. What were you gonna say?

01:25:29.457 --> 01:25:32.459
I don't want to get your hopes too high...

01:25:38.675 --> 01:25:40.467
HOST:
We're joined today in the studio

01:25:40.635 --> 01:25:42.594
by economic analyst Mark Short.

01:25:42.762 --> 01:25:44.513
Now, I want to ask you the same thing

01:25:44.681 --> 01:25:47.141
that must be on the minds
of many of our viewers out there.

01:25:47.308 --> 01:25:49.768
Fine, people have stopped
eating beef for the moment,

01:25:49.936 --> 01:25:51.770
but why is that having
such a big effect

01:25:51.938 --> 01:25:53.605
on these massive
fast-food corporations?

01:25:53.773 --> 01:25:57.818
What, you're telling me they don't have
billions saved up?

01:25:57.986 --> 01:25:59.778
SΗORT: That's exactly right.

01:25:59.946 --> 01:26:01.989
You have to understand
that their hard costs alone

01:26:02.157 --> 01:26:05.117
for a week of operations
are in the hundreds of millions.

01:26:05.285 --> 01:26:06.201
Now you'll remember...

01:26:06.369 --> 01:26:08.120
Mommy, are hamburgers
bad in America, too?

01:26:08.288 --> 01:26:09.204
(cellphone rings)

01:26:09.372 --> 01:26:11.415
Ah, come on.

01:26:11.583 --> 01:26:13.250
Come on, Abby.
Pick it up.

01:26:15.336 --> 01:26:17.296
Come on.
Pick up the phone.

01:26:21.634 --> 01:26:24.761
Abby, pick up the phone.

01:26:24.929 --> 01:26:26.597
SHORT:
It's very unlikely consumers

01:26:26.764 --> 01:26:29.933
will return to beef
anytime in the near future.

01:26:30.101 --> 01:26:34.646
I love you.
Pick up the phone.

01:26:34.814 --> 01:26:36.334
ΗOST: ...demanded
a government bailout.

01:26:36.399 --> 01:26:38.358
Do you think that's likely to happen?

01:26:38.526 --> 01:26:42.362
SΗORT (chuckles): There's really
no chance of a government bailout.

01:26:42.530 --> 01:26:45.157
Well, do you think
the fast-food industry can survive?

01:26:45.325 --> 01:26:48.577
Well, depends on what kind of food
they choose to serve.

01:26:48.745 --> 01:26:50.454
You've reached Abby and Robert.

01:26:50.622 --> 01:26:53.957
Leave us a message,
and we'll call you right back.

01:26:57.837 --> 01:27:00.078
SΗORT: When the threat came only
from the Russian market,

01:27:00.215 --> 01:27:01.175
they could withstand it,

01:27:01.341 --> 01:27:03.383
but now that the beef scare
has gone global,

01:27:03.551 --> 01:27:05.177
the end comes for them
rather quickly.

01:27:05.345 --> 01:27:07.930
ΗOST: Well, I never thought
I would live to see the day.

01:27:09.140 --> 01:27:10.307
(knock on door)

01:27:50.098 --> 01:27:53.850
(overlapping radio chatter)

01:27:54.018 --> 01:27:55.519
Korean Cell
has joined the conference.

01:27:55.687 --> 01:27:57.562
CΕO of Obbidas
has joined the conference.

01:27:57.730 --> 01:28:00.065
CΕO of Johnny Vodka
has joined the conference.

01:28:00.233 --> 01:28:02.234
President of Yepple
has joined the conference.

01:28:02.402 --> 01:28:04.528
The leader
has joined the conference.

01:28:08.408 --> 01:28:11.410
Ladies and gentlemen...

01:28:12.036 --> 01:28:15.372
The Burger is dead.

01:28:18.334 --> 01:28:23.547
The growth of brands
has spiraled out of control.

01:28:23.715 --> 01:28:27.884
Never before in history has it been
this difficult to record growth,

01:28:28.052 --> 01:28:31.888
because there simply is not enough room
in the minds of consumers

01:28:32.056 --> 01:28:36.226
to hold new desires for new products.

01:28:36.394 --> 01:28:38.520
What happened
in the case of fast food

01:28:38.688 --> 01:28:41.898
has fundamentally altered
the market forever.

01:28:43.443 --> 01:28:47.362
A crippling anxiety
has seized consumers.

01:28:47.530 --> 01:28:50.532
They're terrified
the products can hurt them.

01:28:52.368 --> 01:28:56.955
A unique opportunity
now stands before you.

01:28:58.458 --> 01:28:59.791
The time has come

01:28:59.959 --> 01:29:03.503
to clear a free space
in the minds of consumers

01:29:03.671 --> 01:29:06.715
where your products can live on.

01:29:06.883 --> 01:29:11.845
Today, in order to get consumers
to continue to desire computers,

01:29:12.013 --> 01:29:16.975
you have to first make them
lose interest in cellphones.

01:29:17.143 --> 01:29:19.353
What you need is to convince them

01:29:19.520 --> 01:29:23.899
that the competition's brands
are deadly dangerous.

01:29:25.485 --> 01:29:27.819
Destroy the market for cellphones...

01:29:27.987 --> 01:29:30.322
and eradicate the competition.

01:29:31.199 --> 01:29:33.742
For your brands to grow,

01:29:33.910 --> 01:29:36.953
they need to learn how to attack.

01:29:37.121 --> 01:29:40.749
And I know how to teach
your brands to attack.

01:29:44.420 --> 01:29:46.421
(roaring)

01:29:49.509 --> 01:29:51.510
(shrieking)

01:29:55.848 --> 01:29:59.434
NARRATOR: 12 months after the release
of Misha's rumor campaign,

01:29:59.602 --> 01:30:04.147
every remaining corporation in the world
was using his new technology.

01:30:04.315 --> 01:30:07.192
And so began a total brand war,

01:30:07.360 --> 01:30:09.486
everyone for himself.

01:30:16.953 --> 01:30:17.565
(roars)

01:30:39.642 --> 01:30:41.059
(shrieking)

01:30:47.233 --> 01:30:48.834
(Commercial announcer
speaking Russian)

01:31:25.438 --> 01:31:27.439
(creatures roaring, wailing)

01:32:24.830 --> 01:32:26.831
(cracking)

01:32:50.147 --> 01:32:52.315
Well, Jon...

01:32:52.483 --> 01:32:55.360
thank you so much
for taking us to the concert.

01:32:55.528 --> 01:32:58.113
We had such a lovely time.

01:32:58.281 --> 01:32:59.114
My pleasure.

01:32:59.282 --> 01:33:01.074
Right, Robert?

01:33:05.037 --> 01:33:07.330
ANNOUNCER: The popular outcry
against advertising

01:33:07.498 --> 01:33:09.499
continues to be felt across the globe.

01:33:09.667 --> 01:33:12.377
To be an advertiser today
has become more dangerous

01:33:12.545 --> 01:33:15.213
than to admit being
a homosexual in the 1950s.

01:33:15.381 --> 01:33:18.425
Nowhere has this been harder
felt than in Moscow, Russia.

01:33:18.593 --> 01:33:20.343
The Duma recently
voted down legislation...

01:33:20.511 --> 01:33:21.553
- Look.
- It's Daddy.

01:33:21.721 --> 01:33:24.055
...proposing a universal ban
on all advertising.

01:33:24.223 --> 01:33:25.640
As last week's bombing
of Red Square

01:33:25.808 --> 01:33:27.058
by extremists demonstrates,

01:33:27.226 --> 01:33:29.477
many in the public strongly
disagree with this decision.

01:33:29.645 --> 01:33:31.313
- Misha.
- And here is one of the leaders

01:33:31.480 --> 01:33:35.400
of Russian advertising,
Mikhail Galkin. Mikhail?

01:33:35.568 --> 01:33:38.028
Mikhail?
One question please?

01:33:38.696 --> 01:33:40.576
The final word on whether
the Russian government

01:33:40.656 --> 01:33:43.074
will ban advertising
is in the hands of the President.

01:33:43.242 --> 01:33:44.659
What's he going to do?

01:33:46.537 --> 01:33:49.372
I'm sure the President
will make the right decision.

01:33:49.540 --> 01:33:51.499
(crowd clamoring)

01:33:58.341 --> 01:33:59.424
(bell tolling)

01:33:59.592 --> 01:34:01.593
(cellphone ringing)

01:34:04.930 --> 01:34:07.390
You've reached Abby
and Robert in Moscow.

01:34:07.558 --> 01:34:09.934
Please leave us a message
after the tone.

01:34:10.102 --> 01:34:11.561
MISΗA: Ηi, Abby.

01:34:14.148 --> 01:34:15.482
I'm calling to say goodbye.

01:34:17.693 --> 01:34:19.444
I've tried everything.

01:34:21.614 --> 01:34:23.198
I even met with the President,

01:34:23.366 --> 01:34:25.408
but he wouldn't listen.

01:34:28.621 --> 01:34:30.413
You've been right all along.

01:34:31.916 --> 01:34:34.459
What I really needed to do
was see a doctor.

01:34:37.630 --> 01:34:41.132
20 years ago,
I wanted to get rich,

01:34:41.300 --> 01:34:44.302
and that ended with the death
of an innocent man.

01:34:46.180 --> 01:34:50.308
10 years ago,
I wanted to get really rich,

01:34:50.476 --> 01:34:53.687
and that ended
with Veronika in a coma.

01:34:55.940 --> 01:34:59.234
Now I decided to make the world
a better place...

01:35:00.736 --> 01:35:03.988
and instead I just made things worse.

01:35:08.828 --> 01:35:12.080
Why was I so sure the government
would ban advertising?

01:35:12.248 --> 01:35:15.667
They will never ban advertising.

01:35:16.502 --> 01:35:17.669
(scoffs)

01:35:18.838 --> 01:35:21.005
I must have been obsessed.

01:35:24.051 --> 01:35:26.344
And now it's like I've come
to my senses, and...

01:35:29.056 --> 01:35:30.515
and there's bl...

01:35:32.101 --> 01:35:34.185
blood everywhere...

01:35:35.855 --> 01:35:38.440
and it's all my fault, my...

01:35:41.610 --> 01:35:43.695
my insanity.

01:35:50.119 --> 01:35:51.703
I wish...

01:35:55.624 --> 01:35:57.167
I wi...

01:35:59.378 --> 01:36:01.421
Oh, fuck it.

01:36:16.562 --> 01:36:19.731
W-What's going on?

01:36:20.733 --> 01:36:22.442
I'm calling you.

01:36:26.405 --> 01:36:28.031
Okay.

01:36:28.199 --> 01:36:30.200
(crowd chanting)

01:36:55.976 --> 01:36:57.393
Come on. Come on!

01:37:00.856 --> 01:37:02.857
(employees yelling)

01:37:12.576 --> 01:37:14.410
Go! Get inside!

01:37:33.430 --> 01:37:35.557
(yells in Russian)

01:37:35.724 --> 01:37:37.141
(gunfire)

01:37:38.644 --> 01:37:40.645
(man speaking Russian on TV)

01:37:57.830 --> 01:37:59.831
(President continues speaking Russian)

01:38:11.051 --> 01:38:12.886
(crowd cheering)

01:38:13.053 --> 01:38:15.054
(piano music playing)

01:38:32.823 --> 01:38:34.824
(piano music continues)

01:38:37.786 --> 01:38:38.620
(whirring)

01:38:38.787 --> 01:38:40.788
(accordion playing)

01:39:03.312 --> 01:39:05.313
(bell tolling)

01:39:31.674 --> 01:39:33.549
(accordion music ends)

01:39:45.354 --> 01:39:48.106
(beep beep)

01:40:02.037 --> 01:40:03.871
(boy growls playfully)

01:40:05.124 --> 01:40:06.791
(man growls)

01:40:06.959 --> 01:40:09.127
You are on, young man!

01:40:09.294 --> 01:40:11.295
(both growling)

01:40:18.303 --> 01:40:21.264
(babbles)

01:40:22.266 --> 01:40:23.433
(Robert growls)

01:41:36.757 --> 01:41:39.717
NARRATOR:
And a new era began.

01:41:49.812 --> 01:41:51.813
(rock 'n' roll playing)

01:45:14.266 --> 01:45:16.267
(new instrumental playing)

01:45:17.305 --> 01:45:23.545
