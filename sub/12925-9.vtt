Tomorrow morning, hoards
of boaters will bring...

champion...

00:51.600 --> 00:54.200
with four consecutive wins
under his belt.

00:54.300 --> 00:56.733
Vance, how do you do it
year after year?

00:56.833 --> 00:59.000
Well, it takes two ingredients
to make a champion...

00:59.100 --> 01:01.467
rock hard willpower...

01:01.567 --> 01:03.700
and red, white and blue

pretty confident...

about your chances again
this year?

01:09.600 --> 01:10.933

I'm feeling real confident.

I'm gonna eat your [BLEEP].

I'm coming for you.

This year, it's gonna be the
classic overdog story.

01:27.100 --> 01:28.467
I've been training for months.

01:28.567 --> 01:31.300
And no one is gonna
win my boat.

01:31.400 --> 01:34.500

I could do anything.

No, you literally just stand
there as long as you can.

But you gotta keep your hand
on the boat the whole time?

01:57.867 --> 01:59.467
Yeah.

01:59.567 --> 02:01.167
Hey, man, I got a better idea.

02:01.267 --> 02:03.067
How about we forget this boat
thing and let's uh...

02:03.167 --> 02:06.500
stay here and get our day drunk
on, maybe bet on some dog races.

02:06.600 --> 02:08.333
Yeah, but if you win the boat,
you could probably sell it...

02:08.433 --> 02:10.267
and pay off a ton
of your child support.

02:10.367 --> 02:11.767
You know something, Walt?

02:11.867 --> 02:14.167
Every now and then, something
comes out of your mouth...

02:14.267 --> 02:16.667

absolutely insane.

Oh, hey, hey, boys.

02:19.233 --> 02:23.867

slumber party last night!

at like 10:30.

and I were just talkin'...

and being a part of this...

been down there in years.

I'm a little afraid
of big bodies of water...

Huh? No, no, no, he managed
at Chi-Chi's in Panama City.

down and exploded.

whole different kinda hard body.

The question that is on
everyone's mind...

03:51.167 --> 03:54.033
can four-time winner
Vance Trecks do it again?

03:54.133 --> 03:55.100
I guess we're gonna find out...

03:55.200 --> 03:57.133
because here he is now.

04:09.367 --> 04:13.233
He definitely looks ready to
put his hands on a hard vessel.

04:13.333 --> 04:16.567
No doubt about it.

awesome, fingerless gloves...

after I win that boat...

04:26.200 --> 04:28.300
I'm gonna take it and the boat
I won last year...

04:28.400 --> 04:30.300
I'm gonna take them out
on the lake...

on my face, wind in my hair...

impossible, pal.

questions, huh? You a cop?

anywhere!

You didn't raise me...

05:57.067 --> 05:58.567
and you are the biggest quitter
I've ever met.

05:58.667 --> 05:59.533
Give me one example.

05:59.633 --> 06:01.667
You quit high school
junior year.

You also quit countless jobs,
reading of any kind...

you done your research.

But that's ancient history!

finish the competition.

09:45.700 --> 09:46.800
You got it, skipper.

09:46.900 --> 09:48.800
Okay, and don't try to screw me
with regular.

09:48.900 --> 09:51.300
Because if you screw me,
I'll screw you.

09:51.400 --> 09:52.600
No worries, chief!

09:52.700 --> 09:56.100
And if you do a good
enough job...

09:56.200 --> 09:59.267
the other half of this ten
will be waiting for you.

09:59.367 --> 10:00.767
Wipe down the seats, okay?

10:00.867 --> 10:04.733
'Cause Straz puked some
pinot noir. Classic Straz!

10:04.833 --> 10:05.367
Okay.

10:05.467 --> 10:07.800
You got it, amigo.

10:09.400 --> 10:11.300
Wanna take a ride in my
jet-boat?

10:11.400 --> 10:13.800
I get to drive.
Let's go.

10:22.400 --> 10:26.433
Okay, here we are
at mile marker 12...

10:26.533 --> 10:28.067
just off River Road Highway.

10:28.167 --> 10:30.533
We've gotten word of a living
Squatch nest.

10:34.167 --> 10:36.133
Kenny? Guys?

10:36.233 --> 10:41.000
Got debris, shredded clothing,
broken branches.

10:41.100 --> 10:43.467
Definitive signs of a struggle
between man and beast.

10:47.267 --> 10:48.667
Guys?

10:48.767 --> 10:50.367
Can't this thing go any faster?

10:50.467 --> 10:53.733
She's probably halfway
to teen mom by now.

10:53.833 --> 10:56.000
I raised her better than that,
okay?

10:56.100 --> 10:57.100
I mean, what do you think she
could possibly be doing?

10:57.200 --> 11:00.267
Oh, I'll tell you exactly
what she's doing.

11:00.367 --> 11:04.633
Some white trash junky forcing
drinks down her throat.

11:04.733 --> 11:08.333
And he's all, "Yo, babe, what do
ya say we all go downstairs...

11:08.433 --> 11:11.267
"and make some poor decisions
that will negatively impact...

11:11.367 --> 11:15.333
"the rest of our once-promising
lives?"

11:15.433 --> 11:17.200
"Cool. Sounds smart"

11:26.867 --> 11:28.800
Come on, don't be ridiculous.

11:28.900 --> 11:30.167
I'm sure it's just kids
having fun.

11:33.600 --> 11:36.900
Oh, my god! Float-illa!

11:40.267 --> 11:42.767
Hang on, baby! We're coming!

11:43.600 --> 11:51.433
Punch it!

11:51.533 --> 11:54.567
Guys! Kenny?

11:58.967 --> 12:00.833
Whoa, whoa--

12:02.233 --> 12:04.133
I can't believe this.

12:05.700 --> 12:10.800
Walt... I'm your neighbor
species.

12:12.667 --> 12:16.100
We could be... friends.

12:16.200 --> 12:17.067
( LAUGHING )

12:17.167 --> 12:19.433
I can't--
I can't do it anymore.

12:19.533 --> 12:22.367
( ALL LAUGHING )
I can't do it--

12:22.467 --> 12:26.067
Yeah!
Whoo!

12:27.500 --> 12:29.800
We got you!
We did it.

12:29.900 --> 12:34.400
I'm your neighbor species!
We can be friends!

12:34.500 --> 12:36.067
[KENNY] You can't be friends
with a sasquatch!

12:36.167 --> 12:40.033
We read your dumb
Son of Sasquatch theory.

12:40.133 --> 12:41.533
What is that nonsense?

12:41.633 --> 12:42.633
Kenny says it's the dumbest
thing he's ever read...

12:42.733 --> 12:45.067
and he reads at a third-grade
reading level.

12:45.167 --> 12:47.567
It's six grade. Sorry.
Shut-- Kenny, you're an idiot.

12:47.667 --> 12:49.000
Just accept it.
I get it.

12:49.100 --> 12:52.233
A re-initiation prank, you guys
want me back in the group.

12:52.333 --> 12:54.133
What?
No.

12:54.233 --> 12:55.433
It's more of a you're-an-idiot,
so-we-can-laugh-at-you prank...

12:55.533 --> 12:58.867
'cause we don't want you
in the group. Right?

12:58.967 --> 13:00.333
Walt, the only way
we let you back in...

13:00.433 --> 13:03.567
is if you walked
through the door...

13:03.667 --> 13:07.300
with a living, breathing
squatch.

13:07.400 --> 13:08.533
Fall out, boys.

13:13.867 --> 13:17.700
If it's proof they want,
it's proof they're gonna get.

13:18.567 --> 13:22.267
Talk to yourself much? Loser.

13:22.367 --> 13:25.267
Okay, this ain't gonna
be easy...

13:25.367 --> 13:28.600
if we're gonna get access to
this madness, we gotta blend in.

13:28.700 --> 13:30.567
That's gonna require
a party attitude...

13:30.667 --> 13:32.067
and some heavy drinking.

13:43.367 --> 13:44.500
Let's go get my baby.

13:44.600 --> 13:46.367
Hell, yeah, I second the motion.

13:46.467 --> 13:48.333
* I'm feelin' my perfect girl
She got a dirty side *

13:48.433 --> 13:52.200
* I'm talking about four-wheel
out of this flirty side *

13:52.300 --> 13:54.600
Her name's Charlotte!
We're looking for our daughter.

13:54.700 --> 13:56.300
She's like this high.
Yes.

13:56.400 --> 13:57.300
Break away!

13:57.400 --> 14:00.333
Oh, this way? All right.
Charlotte!

14:00.433 --> 14:03.933
Excuse me, sir.
Can I just get by?

14:04.033 --> 14:06.567
I'm good, really, thanks.
It's a rite of passage.

14:06.667 --> 14:09.900
Well, I'm glad you're getting
such a kick out of this.

14:10.000 --> 14:10.600
Okay, let's go.

14:14.633 --> 14:17.633
Ah!
Woo-hoo!

14:20.533 --> 14:24.533
Yeah! Oh, my god, we won!

14:24.633 --> 14:26.800
All right!

14:28.867 --> 14:32.300
Let's keep it moving, okay?
Charlotte!

14:32.400 --> 14:34.833
Charlotte!

14:34.933 --> 14:38.667
Are all these damn boats startin
to look the same to you?

14:38.767 --> 14:44.667
Well, hey, friend. Come back
to borrow a cuppa coffee, hm?

14:44.767 --> 14:50.867
Why don't you let old Coy help
you outta them...

14:50.967 --> 14:51.533
wet clothes.

14:55.767 --> 14:59.133
Oh, hell, no, come on.

14:59.233 --> 15:01.500
Oh... mm

15:01.600 --> 15:04.533
When my brothers at Ruby Ridge
were under siege...

15:04.633 --> 15:07.200
sleep deprivation was their
downfall.

15:07.300 --> 15:09.433
But if any of these bastards
think I'm just gonna pick up...

15:09.533 --> 15:10.900
my hands and say, "I--

15:11.000 --> 15:14.300
Damn it! The same thing happened
to me last year.

15:14.400 --> 15:15.967
I gotta stop telling that story.

15:16.067 --> 15:18.200
Yeah, I came out here to hang
out with my best friend.

15:18.300 --> 15:21.033
Who'd ever thunk I'd make
another best friend, right?

15:21.133 --> 15:23.500
We're not friends.
I don't like you.

15:23.600 --> 15:26.500
But damn it, soldier,
I respect you.

15:26.600 --> 15:28.000
Me, too.
( AIR HORN SOUNDS )

15:28.100 --> 15:28.967
Agh!

15:29.700 --> 15:32.200
Now that's a yawn!

15:32.300 --> 15:33.767
What? No.

15:33.867 --> 15:35.233
This ain't my first time at the
rodeo, cowboy.

15:35.333 --> 15:37.467
That's a yawn.

15:37.567 --> 15:42.433
News flash, pal, that was the
face of a roar, a silent roar.

15:42.533 --> 15:47.767
The roar of a champion,
a legend, a winner!

15:47.867 --> 15:50.467
A roar.

15:50.567 --> 15:53.400
You best get your face
out of my face.

15:53.500 --> 15:58.033
You got that? Huh?

15:58.133 --> 16:00.133
This is about the only boat
we ain't been on!

16:00.233 --> 16:01.700
She gotta be here somewhere!

16:01.800 --> 16:06.067
Vernon, Vernon, Vernon,
this is her purse!

16:06.167 --> 16:09.200
Because see, look! This is the
key chain from the fair!

16:09.300 --> 16:11.200
[CHARLOTTE] Asher, please stop.
You're making me uncomfortable.

16:11.300 --> 16:13.667
[ASHER] Char, don't be like
that. Just let me do it.

16:13.767 --> 16:15.833
You're gonna like it, I promise.
Charlotte!

16:15.933 --> 16:17.467
Seriously, Asher, I said no.
Get away from me.

16:17.567 --> 16:22.833
Hang on, baby! We're coming!

16:22.933 --> 16:24.800
Wait, no, just sit still, I need
you to feel this emotionally.

16:24.900 --> 16:27.400
Gimme that!
Vernon!

16:27.500 --> 16:32.200
Whoa! What the hell, bro?

16:32.300 --> 16:34.700
He was just close-singing me
with his terrible song!

16:34.800 --> 16:36.133
Okay, it's a work in progress!

16:36.233 --> 16:37.600
He's so misunderstood.

16:37.700 --> 16:39.000
Hey! I know what's going
on here.

16:39.100 --> 16:41.367
I know exactly what's going
on here.

16:41.467 --> 16:43.633
You've been drinking.
What's this? Is this rum? Vodka?

16:43.733 --> 16:46.633
It's Coke, Mom.
Oh, my god, are you drunk?

16:46.733 --> 16:48.433
Hey! I'll ask the questions
around here!

16:48.533 --> 16:51.100
Yeah.

16:51.200 --> 16:53.900
What's going on with you,
Snoop Dog? Those pot brownies?

16:54.000 --> 16:55.800
You trippin', man?
A litle weed?

16:55.900 --> 16:56.600
No, man.
Yeah, bro.

16:56.700 --> 16:58.700
Quit harshing our mellow.

16:58.800 --> 17:00.633
What's this weirdo doing here?

17:00.733 --> 17:04.467
No, no, I'm no weirdo.
I'm a member of this band.

17:04.567 --> 17:05.833
And I'm chaperoning.

17:05.933 --> 17:08.133
This is a completely sober
voyage.

17:08.233 --> 17:10.700
We're all fine and safe here.
This is a safe space.

17:10.800 --> 17:11.700
This is so embarrassing.

17:13.600 --> 17:15.533
They may not be doin'
anything bad.

17:15.633 --> 17:18.767
We may have overreacted
just a hair--

17:18.867 --> 17:19.467
Yeah, you think?

17:19.567 --> 17:22.867
You punted his guitar!

17:22.967 --> 17:25.600
So what now?
Should we apologize?

17:25.700 --> 17:27.633
No way. We can't apologize now!

17:27.733 --> 17:29.833
We'll never get the upper hand
back on her.

17:29.933 --> 17:31.333
Right, right, right.

17:31.433 --> 17:33.300
They'll never believe anything
else we ever say!

17:33.400 --> 17:34.233
No, no--

17:34.333 --> 17:35.567
You gotta follow my lead.

17:35.667 --> 17:37.967
Gotcha, go get 'em.
Let's go.

17:38.067 --> 17:40.500
Oh, my god, you guys are wasted!

17:40.600 --> 17:45.400
You didn't-- you, da' lady--
need to get your butt home.

17:45.500 --> 17:47.100
So you are coming with me,
now come on.

17:47.200 --> 17:48.567
Mom, you're drunk.

17:48.667 --> 17:50.767
Dallas, can you take me home?

17:50.867 --> 17:52.433
Yeah, yeah, our boat's just
over there.

17:52.533 --> 17:54.667
Is that okay with you?

17:54.767 --> 17:55.733
I will allow that.

17:55.833 --> 17:58.533
Hey, just don't get all handsy,
buster.

17:58.633 --> 17:59.633
That's right!

17:59.733 --> 18:01.000
What does that even mean?

18:01.100 --> 18:03.633
I don't know,
but it sounds amazing.

18:03.733 --> 18:06.033
I'll tell you what it means,
is this party's over!

18:06.133 --> 18:07.433
That's right.

18:07.533 --> 18:09.533
And just a little word of advice
for you there, grasshopper...

18:09.633 --> 18:14.533
close-singing to a girl without
her permission is never okay!

18:14.633 --> 18:16.000
Now get outta here!

18:16.100 --> 18:20.200
Come on, let's go!
Party's over! Now go on!

18:20.300 --> 18:22.567
We are such awesome parents.

18:22.667 --> 18:26.067
Woo-hoo! We should write a book
is what we should do about it.

18:26.167 --> 18:29.300
We should write a book.
Write a book.

18:29.400 --> 18:31.367
Ah-ha.

18:31.467 --> 18:37.100
Maybe we could just stick
around, have one more drink?

18:38.600 --> 18:43.033
I mean, yeah, sober up
a little bit...

18:43.133 --> 18:45.867
just a couple of light beers.
Yeah.

19:03.833 --> 19:06.367
What the-- oh, damn raccoons.

19:21.933 --> 19:24.400
[BIG D] It's been a long night
here at Sid's Marina...

19:24.500 --> 19:29.067
and we're gettin down to the
wire, folks, down to the wire.

19:32.033 --> 19:35.300
I got some bad news for you,
dude. I ain't even tired yet.

19:35.400 --> 19:37.300
Need... sleep.

Yes! Yes!

I'm gonna win them all!

Then I'm going after your
Ski-Doo! Your snow mobiles!

19:48.000 --> 19:50.867
I'm gonna win-- no, no!
Let's do it over!

19:50.967 --> 19:52.900
Gonna do a redo.
Reset the clock!

19:53.000 --> 19:54.433
You took your hand off!
Nope!

19:54.533 --> 19:55.500
I win!
No!

19:55.600 --> 19:57.433
I'm the winner!
You're the loser!

19:57.533 --> 19:59.533
I'm not no loser!

19:59.633 --> 20:01.733
This is my boat now!

20:01.833 --> 20:03.500
Security! Security!
My boat!

20:03.600 --> 20:07.733
Oh, you better not touch my
jacket, law dog, that's a mesh.

20:07.833 --> 20:09.833
Hey! Hey! Uh-uh, uh-uh.

20:09.933 --> 20:13.100
That's my boat! That's my boat!
( AIR HORN SOUNDS )

20:13.200 --> 20:15.300
I am the champion!

20:15.400 --> 20:21.000
Finally, after all this time,
we have a winner!

20:22.600 --> 20:27.467
Looks like you overlooked one
small thing.

20:27.567 --> 20:28.933
Who the hell are you, pal?

20:29.033 --> 20:30.433
Why do you got your hands
on my boat?

20:30.533 --> 20:32.467
It is my boat now.
Huh?

20:32.567 --> 20:34.533
Maybe you just didn't see me
back there.

20:34.633 --> 20:37.067
Well, congratulations, sir!

20:37.167 --> 20:41.267
You are the winner of a
brand-new SSX Luxury Chaparral.

20:41.367 --> 20:44.433
And here is an extra set of keys
in case you misplace those!

20:44.533 --> 20:46.200
Thanks for listening, see you.

20:46.300 --> 20:47.433
I already gave him the keys!
Well, two is better than one.

20:47.533 --> 20:49.400
No, man, you're always
copying me.

you know--

I think it's outta gas.

Hey there, friend...
a little boat trouble?

Sherry and Coy party sub.

Go away, Coy.

No pressure.

know when you're ready.

to do the Tarzan thing.
