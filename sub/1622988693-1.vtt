03:56.960 --> 03:59.597
Alicia!

04:02.566 --> 04:06.003
Alicia, come here,
I'm not gonna hurt you.

04:15.512 --> 04:17.781
Where are you hiding, huh?

04:20.951 --> 04:22.620
Oh, come on.
Come on, come on.

04:31.894 --> 04:33.630
What are you doing, Alicia?

04:33.663 --> 04:35.765
I only want to talk.

04:35.798 --> 04:37.734
Stay away from me.

04:37.767 --> 04:39.769
Do you hear me, Jace?
You're sick.

04:39.802 --> 04:41.204
I'm not sick.

04:41.237 --> 04:43.706
Then why did you get tested?

04:43.740 --> 04:46.177
I might be sick.

04:46.209 --> 04:47.444
That's right,

04:47.478 --> 04:49.180
and I don't want to be.

04:49.213 --> 04:52.983
Look, there's no need
for all this.

04:53.016 --> 04:56.887
I'm not going to allow you
to infect me with corona.

04:56.920 --> 04:59.122
Don't come any closer!

04:59.156 --> 05:03.194
A knife?
No gun, no pepper spray?

05:03.226 --> 05:05.596
What are you gonna do with that?

05:06.596 --> 05:08.532
Cut.

05:10.567 --> 05:12.136
Daryl, how's focus?

05:12.168 --> 05:14.003
Yeah, looks good to me, boss.

05:14.036 --> 05:16.039
All right, did sound turn out?

05:16.072 --> 05:17.674
Torrance?

05:17.708 --> 05:19.143
I-I hear you.

05:19.175 --> 05:20.810
The sound's good.

05:20.843 --> 05:22.012
Good?

05:22.045 --> 05:23.646
It's good, Parker.

05:23.680 --> 05:25.549
The sound is good.

05:25.581 --> 05:27.851
All right, let's move on.

05:27.884 --> 05:29.052
Moving on!

05:29.086 --> 05:31.254
Everyone to the screening room.

05:31.288 --> 05:34.091
Scene 22, take 1, mark.

05:35.925 --> 05:37.060
Action.

05:37.093 --> 05:39.596
This is the worst place
we can be right now,

05:39.629 --> 05:41.098
and I'm tired of it.

05:41.130 --> 05:42.765
How can you say that?

05:42.798 --> 05:45.201
I've worked my whole life
to get us where we are now.

05:45.235 --> 05:46.136
Your whole life?

05:46.170 --> 05:48.205
For God's sake,
you're 22 years old

05:48.237 --> 05:50.007
and we're living
in your mom's basement.

05:50.040 --> 05:51.575
Cut.

05:52.608 --> 05:54.711
Where's Brenna?
Can we get make-up please?

05:54.745 --> 05:57.247
Dude, don't be so pushy,
I'm right here.

05:57.281 --> 05:58.781
The name's Vince, not "dude."

05:58.814 --> 06:00.184
Does anyone need any water?

06:00.216 --> 06:01.784
- Thanks, Macy.
- Sure, Parker,

06:01.817 --> 06:03.086
anything for the director.

06:05.187 --> 06:07.625
That was great, Alicia, great.

06:07.658 --> 06:11.629
Jace, I need you to be
just a bit more... defensive.

06:11.661 --> 06:14.264
"I've waited my whole life to..."

06:14.298 --> 06:15.833
The line is "worked."

06:15.865 --> 06:18.034
"I've worked my whole life
to get us here."

06:18.067 --> 06:19.103
Right, that.

06:19.136 --> 06:21.805
Just be a bit more defensive.

06:21.838 --> 06:23.607
All right, Parker, got it.

06:27.209 --> 06:28.579
Quiet on set.

06:28.612 --> 06:29.914
Marker.

06:32.749 --> 06:35.252
Lockdown, scene 22, take 2.

06:35.285 --> 06:36.654
Mark.

06:38.788 --> 06:39.923
Action.

06:39.956 --> 06:42.192
This is the worst situation
we could be in right now.

06:42.225 --> 06:43.393
- Cut!
- What?

06:43.425 --> 06:46.262
"Place." "This is the worst
place I've ever been in."

06:46.295 --> 06:48.197
Place, situation.
Worked, waited.

06:48.230 --> 06:50.000
What difference does it make?

06:50.033 --> 06:51.936
It's already day three
and we can't even get

06:51.968 --> 06:53.670
through simple dialogue.

06:53.704 --> 06:55.204
At this rate,
I won't finish this thing

06:55.237 --> 06:57.074
until the third January
of August.

06:57.107 --> 06:58.742
It's only five minutes left
till lunch.

06:58.774 --> 07:01.010
Let's just... break now
and come back to it later.

07:01.043 --> 07:03.012
Right, let's do that.

07:03.045 --> 07:05.115
Break for lunch, one hour.

07:05.148 --> 07:06.317
- Macy?
- Yes.

07:06.350 --> 07:07.818
Did Rona go
for food yet?

07:07.850 --> 07:09.286
I think she's still
in the backyard.

07:09.319 --> 07:11.989
- Is she on her phone again?
- Yeah.

07:12.021 --> 07:15.058
- What are we paying her for?
- I'll let her know.

07:17.093 --> 07:20.129
I've got... I've got nothing
for scene 19.

07:20.163 --> 07:22.633
It's just, I'm stonewalled here.

07:22.665 --> 07:24.935
No, don't worry about it,
I thought we'd just...

07:24.968 --> 07:27.938
Honestly, I thought we'd do
a transition...

07:31.040 --> 07:32.709
Did Rona leave yet?

07:32.742 --> 07:34.110
Yes,

07:34.144 --> 07:36.781
like the house was on fire.

07:38.848 --> 07:41.918
Well, Vince, maybe you
shouldn't have hired her.

07:41.951 --> 07:43.786
Not so fast.

07:43.819 --> 07:45.755
Don't put that on me,
cherry girl.

07:45.788 --> 07:46.824
I didn't hire her.

07:56.666 --> 07:57.700
What the?

07:57.733 --> 07:59.769
- Don't you knock?
- Really?

07:59.802 --> 08:01.271
Try locking the door.

08:08.077 --> 08:10.413
Is something wrong?

08:10.447 --> 08:13.917
Brenna says she saw you
in the bathroom with a needle.

08:15.851 --> 08:17.153
You were.

08:17.187 --> 08:18.756
What, are you denying it?

08:18.788 --> 08:20.324
What's wrong?

08:20.357 --> 08:22.860
Daryl was in the bathroom
using drugs.

08:22.892 --> 08:24.293
I wasn't using drugs.

08:24.326 --> 08:26.196
I saw you with a needle.

08:26.228 --> 08:28.899
Right, Brenna,
that's because it's insulin.

08:28.932 --> 08:30.968
Daryl is a diabetic.

08:32.402 --> 08:35.139
Why didn't you just say so?

08:35.172 --> 08:37.341
- Yeah.
- Because my medical condition

08:37.374 --> 08:40.210
is none of your business,
or yours.

08:40.243 --> 08:42.780
Jesus, I'm not having
this conversation.

08:47.384 --> 08:49.086
Honestly, Jace,
I didn't think things

08:49.119 --> 08:51.422
would get this bad when
I auditioned for this movie.

08:51.455 --> 08:52.590
Yeah, no doubt.

08:52.623 --> 08:55.092
I don't think this movie's
gonna amount to much.

08:55.125 --> 08:57.727
No, not the movie, the virus.

08:58.794 --> 09:00.863
Are you, like, sick?

09:00.897 --> 09:02.099
No! Wake up!

09:02.131 --> 09:03.833
I'm talking about
the quarantines

09:03.866 --> 09:05.034
and everything shutting down.

09:05.067 --> 09:06.803
Oh.

09:06.836 --> 09:07.937
Code nine on the AD.

09:10.740 --> 09:13.309
- How can you say that?
- How can I say what?

09:13.342 --> 09:15.978
Oh, uh, practicing the lines.

09:16.011 --> 09:17.914
Ah.

09:23.220 --> 09:27.091
Hey, uh, does this belong
to anyone?

09:27.124 --> 09:29.759
- No.
- Hmm.

09:34.331 --> 09:36.033
No.

09:36.066 --> 09:37.868
I didn't bring mine.

09:37.900 --> 09:39.836
Does anyone have
a phone charger?

09:39.870 --> 09:41.438
Did no one bring one?

09:43.874 --> 09:46.110
I got one,

09:46.143 --> 09:48.112
plugged into my phone
on the kitchen counter.

09:49.879 --> 09:52.048
Yes, you can use it
when my phone's charged.

09:52.081 --> 09:54.418
Thanks.

09:54.451 --> 09:57.488
And what's the Wi-Fi code
for the house?

09:57.520 --> 10:01.357
I never got it from the producer
before he left.

10:01.390 --> 10:03.826
Why would the producer have it?

10:03.860 --> 10:05.763
Whose house
do you think we're using?

10:07.330 --> 10:10.367
Parker, I have no idea
how long Rona's gonna be.

10:10.399 --> 10:13.336
Wanna just continue
until she gets back?

10:15.172 --> 10:17.441
It's fine with me.

10:17.474 --> 10:20.244
All right, let's do that then.

10:20.277 --> 10:21.412
Listen up, everyone.

10:21.445 --> 10:24.281
We're gonna keep shooting
until the food gets here.

10:24.313 --> 10:26.884
Pick up where we left off.

10:29.952 --> 10:31.788
Let's go.

10:41.230 --> 10:43.533
Where's Jace and Alicia?

10:43.567 --> 10:46.102
Need Alicia and Jace
to set please.

10:47.437 --> 10:49.173
Jace to set please.

10:53.009 --> 10:54.978
How about you give me
a minute, dude?

10:55.010 --> 10:56.312
I can't perform miracles.

10:57.980 --> 10:59.383
Is everyone ready?

10:59.416 --> 11:02.019
You need to chill.

11:02.052 --> 11:03.187
Excuse me?

11:03.220 --> 11:05.322
You need to calm down.

11:05.355 --> 11:07.324
Okay, okay.

11:07.356 --> 11:09.293
Everybody just take a moment.

11:12.328 --> 11:14.531
I've quit better films
than this.

11:16.032 --> 11:17.401
All right, let's go.

11:18.467 --> 11:19.569
Oh, what now?

11:19.602 --> 11:22.004
It's Rona.

11:22.038 --> 11:22.938
Rona?

11:22.972 --> 11:25.474
We have to do something
about their phones.

11:25.508 --> 11:27.377
Okay, everybody,
we need your phones.

11:27.409 --> 11:28.377
Whoa!

11:28.410 --> 11:30.546
Slow your role, cowboy.

11:30.580 --> 11:32.249
I'm not giving up my phone.

11:32.282 --> 11:33.483
Well, is there any food left?

11:33.515 --> 11:36.019
What do you think,
we're in high school?

11:36.052 --> 11:39.089
I don't know about some of us,
but I'm an adult here.

11:39.121 --> 11:40.256
You want my phone?

11:40.289 --> 11:41.991
Try and take it.

11:43.426 --> 11:45.429
Okay, maybe not.

11:45.461 --> 11:47.463
Make sure you just
keep them off.

11:47.496 --> 11:50.466
Whoa, whoa, okay, uh, slow down.

11:50.500 --> 11:52.501
Oh my God.

11:52.534 --> 11:54.237
Rona?

11:54.270 --> 11:56.205
Oh my God.

11:56.239 --> 11:58.408
She says they're looting
and rioting.

11:59.442 --> 12:02.980
Okay, well, um, is there
any way that you could...

12:03.013 --> 12:04.081
Hello?

12:04.114 --> 12:05.349
Rona?

12:07.484 --> 12:09.119
Guys, I think I lost her.

12:09.152 --> 12:10.888
Well, is she coming back?

12:10.921 --> 12:12.522
Did she get the food?

12:12.554 --> 12:15.024
I don't think so.

12:15.057 --> 12:18.160
Did either one of you idiots
just hear the same thing I did?

12:18.193 --> 12:21.197
She said they were looting
and rioting.

12:21.230 --> 12:24.234
- Looting and rioting?
- Yeah, you know,

12:24.267 --> 12:27.104
smashing windows,
throwing rocks,

12:27.136 --> 12:28.337
stealing crap.

12:28.370 --> 12:29.572
Looting and rioting.

12:29.605 --> 12:32.375
Hey, guys, let's just turn on
the TV and watch the news.

12:32.408 --> 12:35.612
Well, good luck getting
a straight story from them.

12:44.453 --> 12:46.622
This is Lynette Carrington
reporting to you live

12:46.655 --> 12:48.524
from the scene,
and I am sorry to say,

12:48.557 --> 12:51.995
this situation
has now just gotten worse.

12:52.028 --> 12:54.364
- The once peaceful protest...
- This can't be real.

12:54.397 --> 12:57.033
...to reopen the country
amid the coronavirus pandemic...

12:57.067 --> 12:59.135
- Turn the sound up.
- ...what I can only describe

12:59.168 --> 13:00.937
as mass pandemonium.

13:00.971 --> 13:04.140
The police have even fired
tear gas into the crowds.

13:04.173 --> 13:05.942
And it now sounds like...

13:05.975 --> 13:07.677
Hold on, yes, yes.

13:07.711 --> 13:09.947
It sounds like gunfire,
and, hold on,

13:09.980 --> 13:11.715
I'm receiving late word
from my producer.

13:11.748 --> 13:13.483
This is terrible.

13:13.515 --> 13:15.217
Yes, my producer has said

13:15.250 --> 13:17.420
the National Guard
is being called out as we speak.

13:17.453 --> 13:19.021
I don't believe
this is happening.

13:19.054 --> 13:22.458
- So let me just update you...
- Yeah, no duh.

13:22.491 --> 13:25.027
Moments ago, at a White House
press conference,

13:25.061 --> 13:26.363
the president announced

13:26.395 --> 13:29.466
an unprecedented
nationwide lockdown.

13:29.499 --> 13:32.134
What that means?
No one is to leave

13:32.168 --> 13:34.370
their place of residence
for any reason...

13:34.403 --> 13:36.206
I think that's enough of that.

13:37.273 --> 13:38.575
He's right.

13:38.607 --> 13:40.409
We have a movie to make.

13:40.442 --> 13:43.013
Maybe you have a movie to make.

13:43.046 --> 13:44.715
I don't think
that really matters now.

13:44.748 --> 13:47.084
Yeah, I'm with Brenna
on this one.

13:47.116 --> 13:49.552
Right, and what else
are we supposed to do?

13:49.586 --> 13:51.620
Everything's on lockdown,
we've nowhere to go.

13:51.653 --> 13:53.389
We might as well finish
the film.

13:53.423 --> 13:54.725
We haven't even had lunch yet,

13:54.758 --> 13:57.160
and now you want us
to keep filming after that?

13:57.192 --> 13:58.160
We might as well.

13:58.193 --> 13:59.495
We can't be any more safe

13:59.528 --> 14:01.063
than we are right here.

14:01.096 --> 14:03.466
If you're hungry,
go have an energy bar.

14:03.500 --> 14:06.470
We have enough energy bars
to last a week! Or something.

14:06.503 --> 14:07.671
You're cute, or something.

14:07.703 --> 14:09.171
All right!

14:09.205 --> 14:12.509
Both of you knock it off.

14:12.542 --> 14:16.146
Maybe if this guy
doesn't eat up all our food.

14:17.447 --> 14:20.317
Actually, this is perfect.

14:20.350 --> 14:22.652
No, really.

14:22.684 --> 14:24.620
We can look out
for each other.

14:24.653 --> 14:26.689
We have enough food
to last a while.

14:26.722 --> 14:29.156
None of us are sick.

14:29.158 --> 14:31.193
I mean, it couldn't be
any more perfect.

14:44.106 --> 14:45.274
Christ.

14:58.187 --> 15:00.256
It's been three days, Jace.

15:00.289 --> 15:02.358
How do you feel?

15:02.392 --> 15:04.061
Not too good.

15:04.094 --> 15:06.430
Uh, I need to call my parents.

15:07.764 --> 15:09.298
My phone's dead.

15:10.767 --> 15:12.402
Can I recharge it?

15:13.302 --> 15:15.237
No, I don't think anyone
will take it,

15:15.270 --> 15:17.373
and I'm sure Vince
won't let you use his.

15:18.240 --> 15:19.809
No one wants to be infected,
Jace.

15:22.211 --> 15:24.313
That's why you're in there.

15:25.215 --> 15:27.451
Well, what if I don't stay
in here?

15:28.184 --> 15:29.819
No, that's not a good idea.

15:31.721 --> 15:33.289
Here.

15:34.456 --> 15:36.359
Thank you for the food, Macy.

15:54.644 --> 15:56.145
What's wrong?

15:56.178 --> 16:00.182
What's wrong?
Where do I start?

16:00.216 --> 16:01.717
At the beginning?

16:03.785 --> 16:05.387
What?

16:05.421 --> 16:08.125
I'm just kidding, gosh.
Tough crowd.

16:09.424 --> 16:10.759
No, I mean right now.

16:10.793 --> 16:12.262
Something's bothering you.

16:12.294 --> 16:14.296
Is Jace okay?

16:14.330 --> 16:16.600
He doesn't feel well,

16:16.633 --> 16:20.370
and I don't think he's planning
on staying down there.

16:20.403 --> 16:22.272
Is that what he said?

16:22.304 --> 16:23.339
Basically.

16:23.373 --> 16:25.642
Right.

16:25.674 --> 16:27.510
Well, we might have to do
something about that.

16:27.543 --> 16:31.447
We can't have him... up here
getting everybody sick.

16:31.480 --> 16:33.683
What do you suggest?

16:39.522 --> 16:41.391
Don't you lock me in here!

16:42.491 --> 16:45.161
Damn it, let me out!

16:46.196 --> 16:47.197
All right.

16:47.230 --> 16:48.532
That should do it.

16:48.565 --> 16:50.934
I hope he can't break
through it.

16:50.966 --> 16:53.502
He's getting sicker,
he shouldn't have the strength.

16:53.535 --> 16:55.204
Unless there's another way out.

16:55.238 --> 16:58.275
Isn't there a window in there?

16:58.307 --> 16:59.842
Come on.

17:07.750 --> 17:09.286
Go, go, go!

17:15.892 --> 17:17.493
No, no, no, no, no, no!

17:18.795 --> 17:21.698
- No! Stop!
- Get something to hold it down!

17:21.730 --> 17:23.400
Grab those pavers.

17:24.634 --> 17:25.800
- Come on.
- Got it?

17:25.835 --> 17:26.803
I got it.

17:31.240 --> 17:32.342
Hurry up!

17:32.375 --> 17:35.478
No, you don't have to do this!

17:35.510 --> 17:37.713
- You need to save your energy.
- Stop! No, I need to leave!

17:37.747 --> 17:39.583
Get me out of here!

17:39.615 --> 17:41.283
You need to relax, Jace.

17:41.317 --> 17:42.852
Relax, Jace.

17:42.884 --> 17:45.288
You're not gonna get away
with this.

17:46.588 --> 17:48.557
Still gonna need to feed him,

17:48.590 --> 17:50.559
or do you plan
to let him starve down there?

17:50.593 --> 17:53.430
I'm not trying
to off him, Vince.

17:53.462 --> 17:55.764
I'm just trying
to keep him away from us.

17:55.798 --> 17:58.768
We'll figure out how to get food
to him when the time comes.

17:59.801 --> 18:02.304
I've gotta wash my hands.

18:02.337 --> 18:03.339
No!

18:03.373 --> 18:06.308
You can't just leave me
down here!

18:13.650 --> 18:16.019
How long do you plan
to keep him down there?

18:16.051 --> 18:18.487
How many days has it been?

18:18.520 --> 18:20.757
Three.

18:22.491 --> 18:24.426
Has anybody seen a towel?

18:24.460 --> 18:27.730
Um, yeah, I think
there's one in here.

18:27.763 --> 18:30.332
- Yeah, here you go.
- Oh, thank you.

18:30.365 --> 18:32.969
Hey, look,
there's a calendar in here.

18:33.001 --> 18:34.637
Oh, we should keep track
of days.

18:36.439 --> 18:39.276
We have no idea how long
we're gonna be here.

18:39.308 --> 18:41.677
Yeah, I think that's
a good idea.

18:45.981 --> 18:48.917
Maybe we should get Jace
to a doctor.

18:48.951 --> 18:51.354
How, Parker?

18:51.386 --> 18:53.589
You've seen the news.

18:53.623 --> 18:55.525
I don't know if the news
is exactly

18:55.557 --> 18:57.294
what we should be trusting
right now.

18:58.694 --> 19:01.931
I'm not willing to bet
my life against it.

19:01.963 --> 19:04.033
Going out there could be
a death sentence.

19:04.067 --> 19:08.305
And not leaving could be
a death sentence for Jace.

19:08.337 --> 19:10.973
I'm okay with leaving him
down there.

19:11.007 --> 19:13.576
At least that way,
he can't make anybody else sick.

19:23.752 --> 19:25.020
Did you see him?

19:25.054 --> 19:26.523
Just that he took the plate.

19:26.556 --> 19:28.491
I didn't get a good look
at him though.

19:29.625 --> 19:30.859
All right then.

19:30.893 --> 19:32.929
Five days and he's still alive.

19:32.961 --> 19:35.531
That's if he doesn't starve
to death first.

19:35.565 --> 19:36.865
Have you seen the pantry?

19:36.898 --> 19:39.702
We're running really low
on food.

19:39.736 --> 19:42.072
We may have to start rationing.

19:42.105 --> 19:45.575
Dude, the food's
the least of my worries.

19:45.607 --> 19:47.109
I just ran out of insulin,

19:47.143 --> 19:49.379
and I usually pack enough
for a few days.

19:49.412 --> 19:52.949
Never expected this lockdown
to last all week.

19:54.784 --> 19:56.119
If you're gonna start rationing,

19:56.152 --> 20:00.856
you better tell foodie
before he eats the rest of it.

20:00.890 --> 20:03.860
Glitter goddess over here
has a problem with me eating.

20:03.893 --> 20:06.696
Right, Torrance,
and with good reason.

20:06.729 --> 20:08.998
We're getting really low
on food.

20:09.030 --> 20:11.600
So now you're in charge?

20:11.634 --> 20:13.702
He is the director.

20:13.736 --> 20:16.840
Of this film, not my life.

20:16.873 --> 20:19.008
I signed up to do sound,

20:19.040 --> 20:20.976
not to hear his noise
about what I do

20:21.009 --> 20:23.579
and don't do
outside of his movie.

20:23.613 --> 20:26.015
Newsflash: We're not making
the film anymore.

20:26.048 --> 20:28.484
Life got in the way.

20:28.518 --> 20:31.520
I can't believe I'm stuck here
with you people.

20:34.824 --> 20:36.493
What's wrong with her?

20:39.494 --> 20:41.130
What does it matter?

20:42.265 --> 20:45.468
I thought dealing with her
on a film set was hard.

20:45.500 --> 20:48.404
She is someone I could deal
without for a while.

20:48.438 --> 20:49.806
- Stop!
- What?

20:49.838 --> 20:51.573
Quiet for a minute.

20:53.142 --> 20:54.576
Do you hear that?

20:54.609 --> 20:56.812
Hear what?

20:56.846 --> 20:58.448
That.

21:08.023 --> 21:10.492
- Did you see it?
- It's a helicopter.

21:10.526 --> 21:11.760
Could you tell what kind?

21:11.794 --> 21:13.463
Police? Defense?

21:13.496 --> 21:14.631
I can't tell.

21:14.663 --> 21:16.465
You heard that quick.

21:16.499 --> 21:17.767
I hear everything.

21:17.799 --> 21:19.802
Oh, I guess that's why
you do sound.

21:19.836 --> 21:21.738
Are they looking
for something?

21:21.770 --> 21:24.106
Or someone.

21:24.140 --> 21:27.644
- Did you see it?
- I did.

21:27.676 --> 21:31.046
Do you think...
that they're shooting people?

21:31.079 --> 21:33.782
Like we saw on TV?

21:33.816 --> 21:35.552
Excuse me?

21:35.585 --> 21:37.019
Shooting people?

21:37.053 --> 21:38.588
No, they can't be
shooting people.

21:38.621 --> 21:39.923
They don't do that here.

21:39.955 --> 21:42.692
We all saw it on the news.

21:42.724 --> 21:44.961
Looks like we're gonna be
stuck here together

21:44.993 --> 21:48.597
for a lot longer
than I had hoped.

21:48.631 --> 21:50.099
Oh, Vince.

21:50.132 --> 21:53.103
We all love you too.

22:02.845 --> 22:05.548
- What's wrong with him?
- Daryl?

22:06.516 --> 22:07.784
You okay?

22:09.218 --> 22:10.653
Um...

22:10.685 --> 22:12.721
Dude looks like
he's about to cancel out.

22:13.756 --> 22:15.124
You're not sick, too, are you?

22:16.157 --> 22:19.261
That's what Jace said
when we quarantined him.

22:19.295 --> 22:20.529
Daryl may be sick.

22:21.763 --> 22:23.198
Daryl, you good?

22:24.232 --> 22:27.236
Yeah, man, I'm going good,
I'm just...

22:27.269 --> 22:28.971
I just need some orange juice.

22:29.005 --> 22:32.041
He's low on insulin.

22:32.074 --> 22:34.076
Well, that's just Gucci.

22:34.109 --> 22:36.078
Jace is going zombie on us
in the basement

22:36.112 --> 22:38.748
and Daryl's about to keel over
on the couch.

22:40.048 --> 22:42.684
Brenna, you're not helping!

22:42.718 --> 22:45.188
All right, all right, I'm out.

22:46.955 --> 22:48.657
Do we have any O.J.?

22:48.691 --> 22:50.159
What's the urgency?

22:50.192 --> 22:51.760
We have a problem.

22:51.794 --> 22:53.263
Daryl's blood sugar
is getting low.

22:53.296 --> 22:55.064
We're trying to find
some orange juice.

22:55.096 --> 22:56.532
Uh...

22:58.200 --> 23:00.068
Will sugar and water work?

23:20.823 --> 23:22.057
Drink this.

23:24.759 --> 23:25.694
Water?

23:25.728 --> 23:28.331
It's mixed with sugar,
it should help.

23:37.472 --> 23:39.341
How long is that
supposed to work?

23:39.375 --> 23:40.442
It'll only be temporary.

23:40.476 --> 23:42.779
We're gonna have to find him
some medical help

23:42.811 --> 23:44.179
if we can't get more insulin.

23:44.212 --> 23:46.749
And how are we gonna do that?

23:48.017 --> 23:49.251
Who are you calling?

23:49.285 --> 23:50.853
9-1-1.

23:53.689 --> 23:55.057
Wrong number?

23:55.090 --> 23:56.858
It's 9-1-1.

23:56.892 --> 23:59.028
How can it be a wrong number?

24:02.897 --> 24:04.833
They didn't pick up.

24:04.866 --> 24:06.935
How can 9-1-1 not be answering?

24:06.969 --> 24:08.971
Is there anyone else out there?

24:19.981 --> 24:22.985
Yes, it's too quiet.

24:23.019 --> 24:24.953
That's what scares me.

24:26.055 --> 24:29.625
I've tried calling
several times.

24:29.659 --> 24:31.628
Friends, family.

24:31.661 --> 24:34.864
No one's willing to risk
their lives to come out in this.

24:34.896 --> 24:39.034
If we don't go for help soon,
Daryl's as good as dead, and...

24:39.067 --> 24:41.136
Jace may be soon to follow.

24:42.971 --> 24:45.141
Yeah, that may be.

24:45.173 --> 24:47.710
The rest of us aren't yet.

24:47.742 --> 24:49.913
Yeah, not yet anyways.

24:51.980 --> 24:53.983
You gonna volunteer?

24:59.422 --> 25:00.423
Daryl!

25:02.424 --> 25:03.859
Daryl!

25:06.061 --> 25:07.362
I tried to stop him.

25:10.766 --> 25:12.134
- Stop! Stop!
- Please help!

25:12.167 --> 25:13.135
Please don't kill me!

25:13.169 --> 25:15.338
Please, I need help,
I just... I'm just sick.

25:15.371 --> 25:17.407
No, don't shoot, don't shoot!

25:17.440 --> 25:19.008
Please don't shoot.

25:19.040 --> 25:20.342
Please, I need help, please.

25:20.375 --> 25:22.177
- Do it now!
- Please, I need help.

25:22.211 --> 25:25.682
He was acting weird, as if he
was like drunk or something,

25:25.714 --> 25:28.016
and he kept on going on
about needing help.

25:28.049 --> 25:30.353
He just got up and ran away.

25:30.385 --> 25:31.921
Don't shoot!

25:31.953 --> 25:33.789
I'm just sick!

25:40.863 --> 25:42.798
Oh, God!

25:42.832 --> 25:43.800
Daryl!

25:44.866 --> 25:46.201
Macy, no, don't!

25:46.234 --> 25:47.703
They will kill you too.

26:01.317 --> 26:02.719
Suspect's a 901.

26:02.751 --> 26:05.721
All right,.

26:12.327 --> 26:13.762
Go back inside, Macy.

26:13.796 --> 26:14.897
Go back inside.

26:40.855 --> 26:42.825
I can't believe
they just left him.

26:44.993 --> 26:48.363
Leave him there
as a warning for all of us.

27:30.138 --> 27:32.307
What just happened?

27:32.340 --> 27:34.109
I mean, what the hell was that?

27:34.143 --> 27:37.579
Everybody just needs
to calm down.

27:37.613 --> 27:38.847
I told you.

27:39.882 --> 27:41.817
I saw it on the news.

27:43.986 --> 27:46.556
They're killing people
that try and leave.

27:47.455 --> 27:49.090
He ran right at them.

27:51.993 --> 27:54.262
I'd have shot him too.

27:54.997 --> 27:57.533
You wanna be the leader, Parker?

27:59.268 --> 28:01.470
So what's the plan next?

28:03.305 --> 28:05.908
We stay put till things change.

28:05.941 --> 28:08.611
And what if nothing changes?

28:08.644 --> 28:10.212
Oh, my bad.

28:10.246 --> 28:12.415
I thought
you actually had a plan.

28:12.448 --> 28:14.350
If you've something
you'd like to add, Torrance,

28:14.383 --> 28:15.585
I'd be glad to hear it.

28:17.920 --> 28:19.522
Really?

28:19.555 --> 28:22.924
Nothing?

28:22.958 --> 28:25.161
I think that's the first time
I've heard foodie quiet

28:25.193 --> 28:26.461
without something in his mouth.

28:26.494 --> 28:27.529
Hey, glitter goddess,

28:27.563 --> 28:29.232
it's Torrance.

28:29.265 --> 28:31.000
How about a little respect?

28:31.032 --> 28:32.100
And I'm Brenna.

28:32.134 --> 28:34.437
You want respect?
Respect me back.

28:34.470 --> 28:37.073
Do I have to put the two of you
in separate rooms?

28:37.105 --> 28:40.041
Just try and see if that works!

28:40.075 --> 28:43.112
We got Jace locked
in the basement.

28:43.144 --> 28:44.480
You wanna join him?

28:47.650 --> 28:50.419
I shoulda canceled on this
project when I had the chance.

28:54.556 --> 28:56.325
That woman is like

28:56.357 --> 28:58.159
nails on a chalkboard.

29:09.570 --> 29:10.973
Brenna?

29:14.977 --> 29:18.348
- What?
- Nothing.

29:25.019 --> 29:26.021
What?

29:27.256 --> 29:29.525
We can go over the wall.

29:31.192 --> 29:32.662
Over the wall?

29:36.332 --> 29:39.168
What if we could move from house
to house through the backyards?

29:39.201 --> 29:41.437
We aren't leaving
the houses really.

29:41.470 --> 29:46.409
We're just moving
through the secured areas.

29:46.442 --> 29:47.576
Okay.

30:04.625 --> 30:07.128
What are they looking at?

30:07.162 --> 30:10.066
And why are they looking
at the wall?

30:14.236 --> 30:15.104
What is she doing?

30:15.136 --> 30:17.173
She may have figured out
a way outta here.

30:17.205 --> 30:18.506
How?

30:18.539 --> 30:21.176
The yards.

30:21.210 --> 30:22.510
Someone help me up.

30:22.544 --> 30:24.180
I'll see if anyone's back there.

30:24.212 --> 30:26.382
Maybe I can throw her over.

30:26.414 --> 30:28.718
I don't know if that's
such a good idea.

30:28.750 --> 30:29.719
Why, Parker?

30:29.751 --> 30:31.186
Because it wasn't your idea?

30:39.494 --> 30:42.330
No, 'cause there's
a huge dog over there.

30:42.364 --> 30:43.432
Damn it, Parker!

30:43.464 --> 30:45.100
Why didn't you say something?

30:45.134 --> 30:46.102
I did!

30:46.134 --> 30:48.237
You don't listen.

30:48.269 --> 30:50.439
You wanna try that one next?

30:50.471 --> 30:52.074
You do it!

30:53.709 --> 30:55.378
It was a good idea, Vince.

30:55.411 --> 30:57.480
She just chose the wrong house.

30:57.512 --> 30:59.280
What about that one?

30:59.314 --> 31:00.615
Knock yourself out.

31:00.648 --> 31:02.784
Vince, you know he'll never make
it over that wall.

31:02.817 --> 31:04.353
You or Parker should do it.

31:04.385 --> 31:06.321
Right, I'll do it.

31:06.355 --> 31:08.356
Vince, would you give me
a boost over?

31:08.390 --> 31:11.060
- I'll help you.
- Vince!

31:12.461 --> 31:14.396
What's wrong with Torrance?

31:14.430 --> 31:16.265
I don't trust him.

31:16.298 --> 31:18.299
I can see just fine.

31:21.069 --> 31:22.137
Hello.

31:26.442 --> 31:28.411
That's not an option.

31:35.250 --> 31:37.385
Parker.

31:37.419 --> 31:39.488
What about that wall?

31:39.520 --> 31:40.822
I don't know.

31:40.855 --> 31:42.424
I know they're not friendly.

31:42.458 --> 31:45.127
They were upset about our cars
parked on the street.

31:51.266 --> 31:52.835
This really blows.

31:55.237 --> 31:57.339
What a leader
you turned out to be.

31:57.372 --> 31:59.442
Daryl's dead, Jace is dying,

31:59.474 --> 32:01.076
and now Kari's sick.

32:01.109 --> 32:04.346
Yeah, she looks like she's
about ready to check out.

32:04.378 --> 32:06.848
Kari,

32:06.882 --> 32:09.652
there's no easy way
to put this, but...

32:09.684 --> 32:11.186
I think you should quarantine.

32:11.220 --> 32:13.556
No, please don't lock me
in there with Jace.

32:13.588 --> 32:16.224
No, no, we're not gonna lock you
in there with Jace.

32:16.258 --> 32:18.126
There's another room down there,

32:18.160 --> 32:21.163
and if you promise
to stay in it,

32:21.195 --> 32:23.231
we won't do any locking.

32:25.567 --> 32:27.236
Okay.

32:29.270 --> 32:30.772
Okay.

32:39.413 --> 32:40.648
Jace.

32:40.682 --> 32:42.550
Has anyone fed him recently?

32:42.584 --> 32:45.421
I gave him something yesterday.

32:45.453 --> 32:48.124
I wonder if he's
even still alive.

32:48.156 --> 32:51.860
I mean, without medical help,
his odds aren't very good.

32:51.894 --> 32:53.394
I'd better check on him.

32:57.798 --> 32:58.867
Jace?

33:00.335 --> 33:02.571
Are you all right in there?

33:02.604 --> 33:04.440
Jace?

33:07.675 --> 33:09.511
Parker, what are you doing?

33:09.545 --> 33:12.314
You are not opening that door.

33:12.346 --> 33:13.715
How else are we gonna know?

33:13.749 --> 33:14.884
Parker, think.

33:14.916 --> 33:18.353
He could be right behind it
waiting for us to open it.

33:18.386 --> 33:19.355
What about the virus?

33:19.387 --> 33:21.490
We can't let it through
the rest of the house.

33:21.522 --> 33:23.192
We already got one more sick
with Kari.

33:23.224 --> 33:26.194
So what do we do?

33:26.228 --> 33:27.796
We leave him in there.

33:27.828 --> 33:32.167
I mean, if he's alive,
he's not going anywhere.

33:32.201 --> 33:35.703
If he's dead,
what difference does it make?

33:35.737 --> 33:37.605
Right.

33:37.638 --> 33:39.440
Good point.

33:54.355 --> 33:56.892
It'll be a week tomorrow.

33:57.759 --> 33:59.728
Even with two less mouths
to feed,

33:59.760 --> 34:02.263
I'm not sure how much longer
our food's gonna last.

34:03.365 --> 34:04.633
Two?

34:04.665 --> 34:06.835
Jace hasn't eaten in two days.

34:06.867 --> 34:10.706
There's no point
to give him any more.

34:10.739 --> 34:14.643
The rest of us, we gotta save
all the food we can.

34:14.675 --> 34:15.878
We're gonna starve.

34:17.246 --> 34:18.914
Where's Torrance?

34:18.947 --> 34:21.650
Not in the kitchen for once.

34:21.681 --> 34:24.385
I think he's crashed
for the night.

34:24.418 --> 34:26.721
I think I'm gonna go to bed
while I still can.

34:26.755 --> 34:28.856
I'll see you guys
in the morning.

34:28.889 --> 34:29.924
Later.

35:14.702 --> 35:16.672
Better with ice.

35:17.572 --> 35:18.874
Come again?

35:18.907 --> 35:20.576
Your water.

35:20.608 --> 35:22.577
It doesn't taste as bad
with ice.

35:22.610 --> 35:24.779
Might as well make it
as bearable as possible

35:24.813 --> 35:26.949
now that tap is all we have.

35:29.885 --> 35:32.354
- Are you not eating?
- Nope.

35:32.387 --> 35:34.390
Now that we're rationed
to once a day,

35:34.422 --> 35:36.324
it's better to wait until later.

35:44.432 --> 35:45.800
Nice day, huh?

35:45.833 --> 35:47.769
And so it is.

35:51.505 --> 35:53.641
Food still hasn't been touched.

35:53.675 --> 35:55.077
Jace?

35:55.110 --> 35:56.478
Of course it's Jace.

35:56.510 --> 35:57.980
He's probably dead.

36:00.114 --> 36:02.450
Did you take any food to Kari?

36:02.483 --> 36:04.752
Is anybody else having trouble
getting service?

36:05.653 --> 36:06.989
I did earlier.

36:07.021 --> 36:08.456
You were able to call out?

36:08.489 --> 36:10.024
No, I had trouble
getting service.

36:10.057 --> 36:11.626
Yeah, me too.

36:11.659 --> 36:14.629
Vince?

36:14.663 --> 36:16.664
Think I could get a charge
for my phone?

36:16.697 --> 36:18.599
I can charge your account.

36:18.632 --> 36:20.568
Funny.

36:22.371 --> 36:24.440
It's in the house,
on the counter.

36:24.472 --> 36:26.641
Great, I'm next.

36:28.909 --> 36:32.914
Does the word "please"
ever come out of her mouth?

36:35.483 --> 36:37.985
I don't think she much likes
to say pleasing things.

36:48.663 --> 36:51.867
Oh, hey, it's apparently better
with, uh, ice.

36:51.900 --> 36:53.668
It's tap water.

36:53.702 --> 36:55.904
I don't think anything
could make it better.

36:55.936 --> 36:57.505
Speaking of tap,

36:57.539 --> 37:00.042
what's on tap for day nine
of quarantine,

37:00.074 --> 37:01.777
Mr. Filmmaker Extraordinaire?

37:01.809 --> 37:03.512
You mean me?

37:03.545 --> 37:05.079
You are the director,
aren't you?

37:05.112 --> 37:06.914
Or so you want us to believe.

37:06.947 --> 37:09.951
You can do whatever it is
you want to do.

37:09.985 --> 37:11.987
I don't much care what you do.

37:12.019 --> 37:14.757
Right now, you could leave,
for all I care.

37:14.789 --> 37:16.391
Wow, I would say that's

37:16.425 --> 37:18.527
a real positive attitude
for a leader.

37:20.929 --> 37:22.097
You're laughing?

37:22.130 --> 37:23.766
We're running out of food,

37:23.798 --> 37:25.534
we have one sick and two dead,

37:25.567 --> 37:26.969
and you think this is funny?

37:27.001 --> 37:29.438
You might not be laughing
very much longer.

37:31.472 --> 37:33.576
You might not be either.

37:47.956 --> 37:50.858
I think it's military this time.

37:56.030 --> 37:58.467
You're not eating again,
are you?

38:04.572 --> 38:06.442
I need to charge my phone,

38:06.474 --> 38:08.509
if that's all right with you.

38:08.543 --> 38:10.546
After mine's done.

38:10.579 --> 38:12.181
You better ask Vince though.

38:12.213 --> 38:14.583
Vince isn't running things
anymore.

38:14.615 --> 38:15.851
Neither is Parker.

38:15.884 --> 38:17.152
I am.

38:30.498 --> 38:31.766
What the?

38:40.541 --> 38:42.677
Is something bothering you?

38:42.710 --> 38:44.812
Just that I went to get
a knife to use,

38:44.846 --> 38:47.114
and all the silverware
is missing.

38:47.148 --> 38:49.218
What do you mean, missing?

38:49.251 --> 38:52.621
I mean, gone, missing,

38:52.653 --> 38:55.990
404, not there!

38:56.023 --> 38:57.326
How else can I say it?

38:57.358 --> 39:00.828
We're almost out of food and now
we're out of silverware too.

39:00.862 --> 39:02.264
We can't be out of utensils.

39:02.297 --> 39:04.900
They've probably just been
collected in the bedroom

39:04.932 --> 39:06.101
or something.

39:06.134 --> 39:08.570
I looked in the bedrooms, Vince.

39:08.603 --> 39:10.739
What do you think,
I'm just making this up?

39:10.771 --> 39:15.811
But why would someone steal
the forks, knives, and spoons?

39:24.318 --> 39:26.721
Now might be a good time
to try and find help.

39:28.556 --> 39:30.825
There won't be many helicopters
flying in this weather.

39:30.858 --> 39:33.929
You can barely see
anything outside,

39:33.961 --> 39:36.731
and besides,
where would we go?

39:36.764 --> 39:40.201
Not to mention you might get
zapped by the lightning.

39:40.235 --> 39:41.603
Great idea, Brenna.

39:41.635 --> 39:42.871
You and Vince go.

39:43.737 --> 39:45.306
You know...

39:45.340 --> 39:49.278
I am sick and tired
of your smart-ass mouth.

39:51.579 --> 39:53.548
You're done.

39:56.050 --> 39:58.186
I thought he was talking to me.

40:00.588 --> 40:01.856
Wow.

40:03.958 --> 40:05.027
Is that a gun?!

40:05.059 --> 40:07.094
Sit down!

40:07.128 --> 40:09.731
Alicia...

40:09.764 --> 40:12.099
You sit down too.

40:12.132 --> 40:14.669
Vince, what are you doing?

40:14.702 --> 40:19.206
I'm making sure
I get out of this alive.

40:19.239 --> 40:24.712
Cause I cannot trust
either of these two.

40:24.746 --> 40:28.684
Nor do I think your leadership
is gonna get us through this.

40:28.717 --> 40:31.753
Or should I say, the lack of it.

40:41.061 --> 40:46.868
Look, it's something Torrence
hasn't eaten yet!

40:56.677 --> 40:59.181
Get the gun!

41:03.784 --> 41:05.019
Drop it.

41:09.090 --> 41:10.659
Oh my God, stop it!

41:10.692 --> 41:12.260
Help, what do we do,
what do we do?

41:12.293 --> 41:13.762
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

41:13.795 --> 41:15.963
They're gonna kill him,
they're gonna kill him!

41:15.996 --> 41:17.765
Shut up!

41:25.974 --> 41:27.909
Stop it!

41:27.942 --> 41:29.144
Get off me, Parker!

41:49.230 --> 41:52.034
Hostile takeover leads
to new leadership.

41:52.067 --> 41:55.403
Now Vince, you sit down.

42:03.478 --> 42:07.115
I'm sick of Brenna and all her
smart remarks.

42:07.148 --> 42:09.418
Tired of Parker thinking
he's running things.

42:09.451 --> 42:11.318
When the only thing
that's been running lately

42:11.351 --> 42:14.188
Is Daryl when he
died in the streets.

42:14.222 --> 42:15.390
I'm sick of being
stepped on

42:15.422 --> 42:18.092
as if a sound mixer
isn't important.

42:18.126 --> 42:19.995
I see more than you know.

42:20.027 --> 42:23.097
I see a helluva movie
when this is all done with.

42:23.130 --> 42:25.232
You should be taking notes,
Parker.

42:25.266 --> 42:27.269
Can't make this stuff up.

42:27.302 --> 42:28.836
Well if you see it so damn well

42:28.869 --> 42:31.440
maybe you should
just write it yourself.

42:31.472 --> 42:33.275
Maybe I will.

42:33.307 --> 42:35.943
And then it will be my writing.

42:39.047 --> 42:40.849
That's what the world needs.

42:40.882 --> 42:42.250
Another writer.

42:42.282 --> 42:44.385
You shut up.

42:44.418 --> 42:45.853
This is exactly
the type of thing

42:45.887 --> 42:48.157
I'm sick of hearing
from you, Vince.

42:51.126 --> 42:54.763
What are you looking at?

42:57.898 --> 43:00.902
Would you look at that?

43:00.934 --> 43:04.172
Did you lose something, Vince?

43:04.204 --> 43:07.275
And what did you
intend to do with these?

43:12.480 --> 43:14.382
Who owns this house, Parker?

43:14.414 --> 43:17.052
Is this guy a cop
or just into kinky sex games?

43:17.085 --> 43:19.221
I already told you it's the
producer's house

43:19.253 --> 43:21.922
and if he comes home
to find you with one of his guns

43:21.956 --> 43:23.458
he's gonna be very upset.

43:23.490 --> 43:24.793
One of his guns?

43:24.826 --> 43:26.827
You mean there's more?

43:26.860 --> 43:30.197
I still wanna know
what happened to the knives.

43:30.231 --> 43:32.768
Interesting question, Brenna.

43:32.800 --> 43:35.036
Anyone know?

43:35.068 --> 43:38.440
Vince, maybe?

43:40.041 --> 43:43.778
Did you suddenly lose
the ability to talk?

43:43.811 --> 43:45.212
No.

43:45.246 --> 43:48.083
Then answer the question!

43:48.115 --> 43:50.451
I threw them over the wall.

43:50.485 --> 43:52.921
To the yard with the dog.

43:52.954 --> 43:54.389
Nice move.

43:54.422 --> 43:57.458
Wouldn't want any competition,
would you?

43:57.492 --> 44:01.196
Thanks, Vince.

44:01.228 --> 44:02.364
I think that's
the first time she's ever

44:02.396 --> 44:04.965
thanked you for
anything, Vince.

44:04.998 --> 44:06.934
I was being sarcastic.

44:06.967 --> 44:09.203
So was I.

44:09.237 --> 44:11.572
Now where's the keys?

44:11.606 --> 44:13.875
You can kiss my...

44:17.177 --> 44:18.913
They're in my pocket.

44:25.052 --> 44:26.587
So what now, Torrance?

44:26.621 --> 44:29.891
How long do you think
you can keep this up?

44:29.923 --> 44:32.293
You gotta sleep sometime.

44:32.327 --> 44:34.129
Good point, Vince.

44:36.130 --> 44:38.432
Lock 'em up.

44:38.465 --> 44:39.835
Not you, Brenna.

44:39.867 --> 44:41.603
I don't trust you.

44:41.635 --> 44:44.105
Alicia, you do it.

44:44.137 --> 44:46.373
- What?
- Me?

44:46.407 --> 44:49.344
Parker and Vince,
cuff 'em together.

44:49.376 --> 44:51.278
One cuff on each wrist.

45:03.324 --> 45:05.894
You really think
this is gonna stop us?

45:05.927 --> 45:07.329
Oh, I'm not done.

45:07.362 --> 45:09.431
Both of you, over there!

45:09.463 --> 45:10.465
Where?

45:10.498 --> 45:13.068
By the staircase, all of you!

45:33.086 --> 45:36.358
Alicia...

45:36.391 --> 45:38.526
open Parker's end,

45:38.559 --> 45:40.961
put the link chain
around the banister post,

45:40.994 --> 45:43.030
and then relock Parker.

45:45.132 --> 45:47.001
Sit down!

45:59.012 --> 46:00.315
Who are you calling?

46:00.347 --> 46:01.349
Doesn't make any difference,

46:01.382 --> 46:03.385
I still can't get any service.

46:05.719 --> 46:08.022
Maybe the lightning
hit a cell tower?

46:33.047 --> 46:34.449
How long was I out?

46:37.251 --> 46:40.455
Not long enough.

46:40.487 --> 46:42.690
I'm guessing if
it were up to you,

46:42.724 --> 46:46.327
I would be out completely.

46:46.360 --> 46:48.063
Breakfast time!

46:51.398 --> 46:53.233
Thank you.

46:53.266 --> 46:55.002
Hope you don't mind, but...

46:55.036 --> 46:57.972
I had to spread the peanut
butter with my finger.

46:58.005 --> 46:59.306
What'd you expect, Vince?

46:59.340 --> 47:02.242
You 86ed all the knives.

47:02.275 --> 47:05.547
Sorry, not sorry, dude.

47:05.579 --> 47:07.748
Not much else left.

47:07.782 --> 47:10.018
Suppose you could starve.

47:10.050 --> 47:11.219
Won't break my heart either way.

47:11.251 --> 47:14.422
I hope you at least washed
your hands before you did it.

47:23.597 --> 47:25.366
Did you unlock them
this morning, Alicia,

47:25.400 --> 47:27.501
so they could use the bathroom?

47:27.534 --> 47:29.069
Yes.

47:29.103 --> 47:31.106
One at a time, right?

47:31.139 --> 47:34.242
One at a time, Torrance.

47:38.179 --> 47:40.447
Did anyone turn on
the news this morning?

47:40.481 --> 47:42.684
See what's going on?

47:42.717 --> 47:45.286
I did earlier,
but the cable's out.

47:47.554 --> 47:50.759
Anybody take Kari
some crackers and water?

47:50.791 --> 47:52.693
I took some down to her.

47:54.829 --> 47:56.631
Thank you, Macy.

47:56.664 --> 47:59.667
Someone else has to
do it next time, though.

47:59.699 --> 48:02.269
It smells terrible down there.

48:02.302 --> 48:04.772
Told you, it's probably Jace.

48:04.806 --> 48:07.708
Really?

48:07.742 --> 48:09.477
What else could it be?

48:11.311 --> 48:13.347
God, please help us.

48:20.487 --> 48:22.456
Vince.

48:22.489 --> 48:24.425
- Vince, Vince.
- What?

48:24.458 --> 48:28.362
Torrance has
fallen asleep again.

48:28.396 --> 48:30.465
Did you see where
the girls went?

48:30.498 --> 48:32.133
Where are they?

48:32.166 --> 48:34.602
I don't, I don't
know where they are.

48:34.635 --> 48:37.405
And that's just our luck.

48:37.438 --> 48:39.606
Can't get far enough away
from Brenna any other time,

48:39.639 --> 48:43.644
and now that we need her,
she's not around.

48:43.677 --> 48:45.313
Oh, there she is,
there she is, look!

48:45.346 --> 48:48.615
- Brenna! Brenna!
- Brenna! Brenna!

48:48.648 --> 48:50.384
- Brenna!
- Don't, don't, look.

48:50.418 --> 48:51.853
We'll get her, we'll get her.

48:54.489 --> 48:55.456
Oh, go down, go down!

48:55.489 --> 48:59.093
Shh, shh, shh, shh!

49:01.295 --> 49:03.231
Okay, we're good, we're good.

49:04.532 --> 49:07.268
Brenna! Brenna, Brenna, Brenna!

49:07.300 --> 49:08.869
What?

49:10.438 --> 49:14.142
Unlock us!

49:23.851 --> 49:26.221
You like Torrance
having the gun?

49:26.253 --> 49:28.889
I don't care.

49:28.922 --> 49:31.258
He waves it around in his sleep.

49:31.291 --> 49:33.127
He's gonna shoot somebody.

49:37.264 --> 49:40.634
Where are they keys?

49:40.668 --> 49:42.269
The keys?

49:42.302 --> 49:44.172
I don't have them.

49:44.204 --> 49:45.572
Who has them?

49:45.606 --> 49:48.576
- I don't know.
- How do you not know?

49:55.782 --> 49:57.384
Macy,

49:57.418 --> 49:58.920
come here.

50:03.224 --> 50:04.459
Do you have the key?

50:04.492 --> 50:06.760
The key to what?

50:06.793 --> 50:08.629
The handcuffs.

50:08.663 --> 50:11.900
No, I think
Alicia has them, why?

50:11.932 --> 50:14.335
We need to get it
and unlock Parker.

50:14.367 --> 50:16.538
- You're gonna unlock Park...
- Shh!

50:19.539 --> 50:21.342
Not so loud!

50:25.713 --> 50:27.382
Why so quiet?

50:41.561 --> 50:43.565
Have these been washed?

50:43.597 --> 50:45.599
I, uh,

50:45.632 --> 50:47.534
sure, yeah.

50:47.568 --> 50:50.605
I mean, I think so.

50:50.637 --> 50:52.773
What are you two up to?

50:52.806 --> 50:54.241
Nothing.

50:54.275 --> 50:56.677
Um, I came in here
to get some water

50:56.710 --> 50:59.246
just like you, um.

50:59.280 --> 51:01.283
I'm gonna go back outside now.

51:07.855 --> 51:10.724
She came to get some water?

51:10.757 --> 51:12.493
That's what she said.

51:15.362 --> 51:17.664
Except she didn't get any water.

51:17.697 --> 51:19.567
What do you want
me to say, Torrance?

51:19.599 --> 51:22.436
I do makeup,
I don't read minds.

51:45.893 --> 51:47.961
You both comfortable?

51:47.994 --> 51:50.931
Yeah, Torrance, we're great.

52:02.376 --> 52:03.911
You still have the key?

52:03.943 --> 52:06.581
The key to what?

52:06.614 --> 52:07.882
The handcuffs.

52:07.914 --> 52:10.518
What do you think I mean,
the key to your car?

52:10.550 --> 52:12.052
I have them right here.

52:12.085 --> 52:15.355
Good, we need to unlock
Vince and Parker.

52:15.389 --> 52:16.524
I'm not gonna do that.

52:16.556 --> 52:18.825
Neither am I.

52:18.858 --> 52:21.496
- Give it to me.
- What are you doing?

52:21.528 --> 52:23.664
- Give it to me.
- I don't like this.

52:23.697 --> 52:26.667
- You guys need to stop!
- You need to shut up.

52:26.701 --> 52:27.902
Alicia.

52:30.704 --> 52:31.972
Here.

52:34.041 --> 52:36.911
Neither one of you
has to worry, I'll do it.

52:36.943 --> 52:38.779
You're gonna unlock Vince?

52:38.813 --> 52:41.816
I didn't even think
you liked him.

52:41.849 --> 52:44.318
I don't!

52:44.351 --> 52:47.521
But I like Torrance even less.

52:47.554 --> 52:50.625
Think of it as
the lesser of two evils.

52:50.657 --> 52:53.094
Now we just have to wait
for him to fall back asleep.

53:29.063 --> 53:30.731
Psst!

53:34.101 --> 53:35.670
Psst!

53:39.139 --> 53:41.108
Psst!

53:57.056 --> 53:59.159
Shh!

54:09.702 --> 54:10.905
I've got it.

54:16.043 --> 54:17.745
Go back, go back, I've got it.

54:17.777 --> 54:19.846
I've got it, I've got it.

54:33.159 --> 54:34.761
Brenna!

54:34.795 --> 54:36.764
I'm in here.

54:38.766 --> 54:40.568
What are you doing?

54:40.601 --> 54:42.603
I'm charging my phone.

55:17.103 --> 55:18.705
What are you guys doing?

55:18.739 --> 55:20.608
Just get the cuffs off!

55:20.641 --> 55:22.076
Just get 'em off!

55:26.679 --> 55:29.049
What?

55:29.083 --> 55:30.251
Lay down!

55:44.797 --> 55:46.967
Can you see anything?

55:47.001 --> 55:48.836
No.

55:52.005 --> 55:54.208
Turn around before he sees us.

55:54.240 --> 55:56.076
Last thing we need
is a guy with a gun

55:56.110 --> 55:58.012
to be suspicious of us.

56:11.858 --> 56:13.994
We gotta get the gun.

56:34.648 --> 56:37.050
Vince, what?

56:47.094 --> 56:50.932
We don't need to kill him,
we just need to get the gun.

56:55.235 --> 56:56.871
What are you doing, Parker?

56:56.903 --> 56:59.239
- I had him!
- Do you really wanna kill him?

56:59.273 --> 57:00.675
Yes!

57:00.708 --> 57:01.909
Piece of shit jumped me!

57:01.942 --> 57:04.579
Because you pulled a gun on us!

57:06.179 --> 57:07.315
Who has the gun now?

57:07.347 --> 57:09.884
Dude, that's right,
that's exactly what we need,

57:09.916 --> 57:12.652
the gun!

57:12.686 --> 57:14.121
Be my guest.

57:53.159 --> 57:55.028
What are you doing, Parker?

57:55.061 --> 57:58.766
This has gone on long enough.

58:01.001 --> 58:03.070
I don't wanna hurt you, Parker.

58:03.103 --> 58:04.938
You don't have to.

58:06.206 --> 58:08.142
It doesn't have to be...

58:09.376 --> 58:11.711
...like this.

58:14.213 --> 58:16.683
- What, what?
- Oh, my God!

58:16.717 --> 58:18.152
You shot me!

58:21.088 --> 58:24.659
My God, Torrance, you shot him!

58:26.393 --> 58:28.396
I didn't mean to!

58:28.429 --> 58:31.032
Why did he have to grab the gun?

58:31.065 --> 58:33.067
Oh, my God!

58:33.099 --> 58:36.103
We didn't mean to.

58:36.135 --> 58:38.972
Brenna we... go get towels.

58:39.005 --> 58:40.206
Go!

58:43.043 --> 58:45.680
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

58:45.713 --> 58:49.083
I'm sorry, Parker.

58:49.115 --> 58:50.918
You're sorry?

58:53.186 --> 58:56.123
Vince.

58:58.025 --> 59:00.860
What?

59:00.893 --> 59:03.730
Oh, my God!

59:03.764 --> 59:04.899
What?

59:08.001 --> 59:09.870
- He shot him.
- I know.

59:09.902 --> 59:11.805
I can't believe he shot him.

59:15.275 --> 59:16.143
Brenna!

59:18.945 --> 59:20.980
Let me just, let me just.

59:21.014 --> 59:24.818
Brenna, I need a bowl
and, and a glass of water.

59:28.521 --> 59:30.157
I didn't get the gun.

59:32.525 --> 59:37.063
Coming.

59:41.235 --> 59:43.838
And then an antiseptic or

59:43.871 --> 59:45.773
some bandages.

59:47.807 --> 59:49.844
- I'm sorry.
- No, no, no, no.

59:52.378 --> 59:55.516
We're gonna be fine.

59:55.548 --> 59:57.384
We're gonna be fine.

01:00:08.295 --> 01:00:11.932
We don't have antiseptic,
but we have these.

01:00:24.378 --> 01:00:26.180
Dammit!

01:00:50.903 --> 01:00:53.440
You son of a bitch!

01:00:53.472 --> 01:00:55.241
Get away from me!

01:00:57.344 --> 01:00:58.913
What are you gonna do now?

01:00:58.945 --> 01:01:00.380
Shoot all of us?

01:01:00.414 --> 01:01:02.483
Vince, stop!

01:01:02.516 --> 01:01:04.251
What do you mean stop?

01:01:04.284 --> 01:01:06.287
We gonna let him
get away with this?

01:01:08.121 --> 01:01:10.324
I didn't mean to shoot him!

01:01:10.356 --> 01:01:12.393
Then give me the gun.

01:01:14.293 --> 01:01:16.163
I'm not gonna let you shoot me.

01:01:17.864 --> 01:01:20.133
Give me the damn gun.

01:01:20.166 --> 01:01:22.235
Get away from me!

01:01:24.271 --> 01:01:26.173
All of my life,

01:01:26.206 --> 01:01:29.943
I've had to put up
with people like you

01:01:29.976 --> 01:01:32.078
always trying to run over me,

01:01:32.112 --> 01:01:35.983
telling me that I'm no good,

01:01:36.016 --> 01:01:37.952
blaming me for things

01:01:37.985 --> 01:01:40.487
that I can't control
or didn't do!

01:01:40.519 --> 01:01:42.422
Blaming you for what?

01:01:42.456 --> 01:01:44.425
For what?

01:01:44.458 --> 01:01:48.061
You're trying to blame me
for shooting Parker!

01:01:48.094 --> 01:01:49.896
Parker's dead!

01:01:58.905 --> 01:02:01.074
He, he's dead?

01:02:01.108 --> 01:02:02.509
That's right.

01:02:02.541 --> 01:02:05.346
He's dead.

01:02:15.121 --> 01:02:18.625
I didn't mean to shoot him!

01:02:18.659 --> 01:02:21.461
I know you didn't mean to,

01:02:21.494 --> 01:02:25.132
so give me the gun
before anyone else gets hurt.

01:02:28.335 --> 01:02:30.537
Give it to you?

01:02:30.570 --> 01:02:34.541
- So you can kill me?
- No, no, no, no.

01:02:34.574 --> 01:02:36.443
Tired of all the hurt.

01:02:38.144 --> 01:02:41.114
I'm tired of being hurt!

01:02:44.251 --> 01:02:46.320
I'll give you the gun,

01:02:46.353 --> 01:02:47.688
but you won't get me.

01:02:47.721 --> 01:02:48.989
Oh, no, no, no!

01:02:51.557 --> 01:02:52.992
Ah!

01:02:57.697 --> 01:02:59.465
Oh, my God!

01:03:22.222 --> 01:03:25.960
Least he won't eat anymore.

01:03:29.528 --> 01:03:31.065
Jeez, Brenna!

01:03:31.097 --> 01:03:35.302
Will you at least
let the body get cold?

01:03:35.335 --> 01:03:36.168
Not like it really matters,

01:03:36.202 --> 01:03:39.105
we're almost
out of food anyways.

01:03:39.139 --> 01:03:41.409
Be lucky if we don't all starve.

01:03:47.547 --> 01:03:48.983
Brenna?

01:03:49.016 --> 01:03:50.617
What?

01:03:50.650 --> 01:03:53.220
Has anyone
checked on Kari lately?

01:03:53.253 --> 01:03:54.488
I'm not doing it.

01:03:54.521 --> 01:03:56.156
I didn't ask you
if you wanted to do it.

01:03:56.188 --> 01:03:58.291
I asked if anybody has done it.

01:04:01.094 --> 01:04:02.963
Never mind.

01:04:05.264 --> 01:04:07.167
I'll do it.

01:04:18.210 --> 01:04:20.446
Kari?

01:04:47.273 --> 01:04:51.277
It's just the four of us now.

01:04:51.311 --> 01:04:53.747
Kari?

01:04:53.780 --> 01:04:55.082
She's dead.

01:04:59.753 --> 01:05:03.524
So what now, Vince?

01:05:03.556 --> 01:05:04.824
What did you expect?

01:05:04.858 --> 01:05:06.626
A happy ending?

01:05:06.659 --> 01:05:10.063
We all knew what the world
was like before we came here,

01:05:10.097 --> 01:05:14.334
and now it's descended
into God knows what.

01:05:16.702 --> 01:05:19.739
That's the world now.

01:05:19.773 --> 01:05:22.742
That's our life now.

01:05:22.775 --> 01:05:25.211
I don't know what you
want me to do about it.

01:05:36.655 --> 01:05:40.126
Has anyone been able to get
a signal out recently?

01:05:40.159 --> 01:05:41.694
Nope.

01:05:45.498 --> 01:05:49.702
Well, we should keep our
phones charged in case it's

01:05:49.735 --> 01:05:51.170
just a tower
and not the network,

01:05:51.204 --> 01:05:56.810
and we might be able
to get a signal out soon.

01:06:18.197 --> 01:06:20.900
Any more of that left?

01:06:20.934 --> 01:06:22.736
That's all that's left.

01:06:22.768 --> 01:06:24.637
The food is gone.

01:06:26.773 --> 01:06:29.776
At least it's something
with some flavor.

01:06:37.284 --> 01:06:40.554
How much longer do you guys
think we can go with no food?

01:06:44.291 --> 01:06:47.728
No one's coming for help.

01:06:47.760 --> 01:06:49.896
Might as well decide if
we're gonna stay here and die,

01:06:49.929 --> 01:06:52.832
- or...
- What?

01:06:52.865 --> 01:06:54.434
Take our chances out there
and get gunned down

01:06:54.467 --> 01:06:55.635
like Daryl was?

01:06:55.668 --> 01:06:58.672
What difference does it make
if we're dead either way?

01:06:58.704 --> 01:07:00.373
I mean, isn't that
why Daryl left?

01:07:00.407 --> 01:07:03.477
Because he had no choice?

01:07:03.510 --> 01:07:06.280
I mean, we don't have much
of a choice anymore either.

01:07:08.748 --> 01:07:12.186
If you wanna leave,
then leave.

01:07:12.219 --> 01:07:14.188
I'm not stopping you.

01:07:25.297 --> 01:07:27.867
Nice to see everyone
so jazzed this morning.

01:07:27.900 --> 01:07:32.873
Brenna, do me a favor
and zip it.

01:07:32.905 --> 01:07:36.409
Had enough of your mouth
over the last two weeks.

01:07:36.443 --> 01:07:37.578
Wow.

01:07:37.610 --> 01:07:38.578
I would say someone pissed

01:07:38.612 --> 01:07:39.880
in your cereal this morning,

01:07:39.913 --> 01:07:42.215
but we don't have any cereal.

01:07:49.623 --> 01:07:51.358
Whatever.

01:07:51.391 --> 01:07:54.894
You know, you're not
making things any easier.

01:07:54.927 --> 01:07:57.297
What, so now this is my fault?

01:08:02.335 --> 01:08:04.737
Are we leaving?

01:08:04.771 --> 01:08:06.740
Leaving?

01:08:06.773 --> 01:08:08.408
Where you gonna go?

01:08:08.440 --> 01:08:11.744
Um, we were thinking
of going to find help.

01:08:11.777 --> 01:08:13.779
Knock yourself out.

01:08:13.813 --> 01:08:14.681
While you're at it,
why don't you

01:08:14.713 --> 01:08:15.614
bring me a change of clothes

01:08:15.648 --> 01:08:16.649
'cause unlike you
prima-donna actors,

01:08:16.682 --> 01:08:20.752
the crew didn't bring
a change of wardrobe.

01:08:20.787 --> 01:08:22.823
Just hope you make it back.

01:08:22.854 --> 01:08:24.625
Thanks for the words
of encouragement.

01:08:24.658 --> 01:08:26.627
No problem.

01:08:29.761 --> 01:08:33.832
How do you manage
to find any work?

01:08:33.867 --> 01:08:34.868
Work?

01:08:34.902 --> 01:08:37.671
Yeah, you have been
a pain since we got here.

01:08:37.703 --> 01:08:39.904
Why would anyone
want you on their set?

01:08:39.939 --> 01:08:42.341
Well, let me
tell you why, Alicia,

01:08:42.375 --> 01:08:44.845
because I'm the best
this town has to offer.

01:08:44.877 --> 01:08:46.845
And when you want the best,

01:08:46.880 --> 01:08:48.981
you hire the best.

01:08:49.015 --> 01:08:51.385
I think I would
settle for second.

01:08:51.417 --> 01:08:55.054
Well, it's a good thing
no one asked you, then, Macy.

01:08:55.087 --> 01:08:58.658
I'm sick of this shit.

01:09:01.594 --> 01:09:02.863
Where are you going?

01:09:02.895 --> 01:09:05.497
To charge my phone,
if that's not a problem.

01:09:05.532 --> 01:09:09.069
I didn't realize I had
to ask for permission.

01:09:09.100 --> 01:09:11.837
And who's phone charger
are you gonna use?

01:09:13.671 --> 01:09:15.573
Yours?

01:09:15.608 --> 01:09:17.844
That's your problem
right there, Brenna.

01:09:17.877 --> 01:09:20.647
You never ask for permission,
and even if you do,

01:09:20.680 --> 01:09:25.350
I never hear a please,
or thank you for anything!

01:09:25.385 --> 01:09:27.319
- Please?
- No!

01:09:27.354 --> 01:09:28.788
No?

01:09:28.822 --> 01:09:31.823
You heard me,
your ears are workin'.

01:09:31.858 --> 01:09:33.627
No.

01:09:46.573 --> 01:09:48.776
Good luck dealing with her now!

01:09:54.113 --> 01:09:55.915
I've had it

01:09:55.948 --> 01:09:57.116
with all of you.

01:09:59.786 --> 01:10:02.122
If I can't use this charger,

01:10:02.154 --> 01:10:03.923
no one can.

01:10:16.069 --> 01:10:19.139
I've had it with you!

01:10:24.476 --> 01:10:25.945
Vince, stop!

01:10:29.515 --> 01:10:31.117
Vince, you're killing her!

01:10:33.420 --> 01:10:36.789
Stop it! Stop, Vince!

01:10:36.823 --> 01:10:38.625
Vince, let go of her!

01:10:45.064 --> 01:10:46.967
Oh, my God!

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:48.734
No!

01:10:51.069 --> 01:10:52.738
Brenna!

01:10:52.771 --> 01:10:54.608
Okay, you're okay.

01:11:01.113 --> 01:11:02.548
Not again!

01:11:02.582 --> 01:11:04.151
You killed Brenna!

01:11:07.453 --> 01:11:08.154
Don't touch her!

01:11:08.188 --> 01:11:10.724
I'm getting her out of the pool.

01:11:32.679 --> 01:11:34.748
Is that enough for you now?

01:11:41.488 --> 01:11:44.191
I'm done.

01:11:44.224 --> 01:11:46.193
I'll take my chances
with the police

01:11:46.225 --> 01:11:48.894
and the military helicopters.

01:11:48.927 --> 01:11:50.930
We have nothing else to lose.

01:11:55.268 --> 01:11:57.971
Did you hear that?

01:11:58.003 --> 01:12:00.873
Hear what?

01:12:00.907 --> 01:12:04.610
Nothing,
the helicopters are gone.

01:12:08.948 --> 01:12:11.718
Looks like
the power's out again.

01:12:15.287 --> 01:12:16.822
I think he has the virus.

01:12:21.127 --> 01:12:23.263
Maybe you should be quarantined.

01:12:27.132 --> 01:12:30.202
Where are you going?

01:12:36.842 --> 01:12:38.744
We're not going anywhere.

01:12:48.587 --> 01:12:50.923
We're gonna sit here

01:12:50.957 --> 01:12:52.726
and wait.

01:12:52.759 --> 01:12:54.860
Wait for what, Vince?

01:12:58.797 --> 01:13:00.166
If I'm gonna die,

01:13:00.198 --> 01:13:02.201
gonna do it on my terms.

01:13:02.234 --> 01:13:04.837
I'm not gonna be
locked in some room

01:13:04.871 --> 01:13:07.606
like an animal,
wasting away like Jace.

01:13:07.640 --> 01:13:10.544
So, what? We die with you?

01:13:10.577 --> 01:13:12.212
Yes, Alicia!

01:13:14.314 --> 01:13:16.048
But, maybe we could help.

01:13:21.354 --> 01:13:23.757
Help.

01:13:23.789 --> 01:13:26.326
Yeah, you can help!

01:13:26.359 --> 01:13:29.062
You can, you can start by

01:13:29.095 --> 01:13:32.231
watching me give the virus to

01:13:32.265 --> 01:13:35.802
- Alicia!
- What?

01:13:35.835 --> 01:13:36.903
Vince, stop!

01:13:40.139 --> 01:13:43.143
- Get off of her!
- Don't worry

01:13:43.176 --> 01:13:44.244
you're next.

01:13:48.381 --> 01:13:50.884
Get off!

01:13:56.355 --> 01:13:57.990
Is that all you got?

01:14:01.159 --> 01:14:02.929
Is that all you got, Macy?

01:14:10.069 --> 01:14:11.638
Jace?

01:14:14.239 --> 01:14:17.844
We thought you were dead!

01:14:17.877 --> 01:14:21.081
Macy kept bringing me food.

01:14:21.113 --> 01:14:23.949
I couldn't let him starve.

01:14:23.983 --> 01:14:25.819
I found a way out.

01:14:26.953 --> 01:14:30.090
Oh, my God,
I think he's waking up.

01:14:30.122 --> 01:14:32.358
Get the gun!

01:14:35.360 --> 01:14:36.895
Do it!

01:14:43.101 --> 01:14:47.407
No! Macy, don't!

01:15:00.420 --> 01:15:01.921
Shoot him!

01:15:03.956 --> 01:15:05.125
Macy!

01:15:05.158 --> 01:15:06.860
Let him go!

01:15:16.368 --> 01:15:18.203
Don't make me do it, Vince.

01:15:21.841 --> 01:15:23.343
You can't do it.

01:15:25.944 --> 01:15:27.346
I can.

01:15:27.380 --> 01:15:30.350
We both know you can't do it.

01:15:30.382 --> 01:15:32.085
You don't got it in ya.

01:15:33.720 --> 01:15:35.288
Huh?

01:15:35.320 --> 01:15:38.024
You can't do it, Macy,
just put it down.

01:15:38.056 --> 01:15:39.391
Put it down.

01:15:41.894 --> 01:15:45.164
Just give it to me.

01:15:45.198 --> 01:15:47.000
You can't do it, Macy.

01:15:47.033 --> 01:15:49.135
- Alicia!
- Oh, but I can!

01:16:24.136 --> 01:16:25.237
Jace?

01:16:25.270 --> 01:16:27.239
Jace, come on, wake up.

01:16:27.273 --> 01:16:28.975
We have to go, come on.

01:16:29.007 --> 01:16:30.476
We have to get outta here,
come on, wake up.

01:16:30.510 --> 01:16:32.878
What?

01:16:32.912 --> 01:16:34.481
What happened?

01:16:40.953 --> 01:16:42.489
We just have to get out of here.

01:16:42.521 --> 01:16:44.423
Come on, can you walk?

01:16:44.457 --> 01:16:46.793
Yeah, I think so.

01:16:46.826 --> 01:16:48.528
Yeah, let's get outta here.

01:17:55.119 --> 01:18:00.119
