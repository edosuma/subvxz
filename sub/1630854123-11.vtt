WEBVTT

00:07.485 --> 00:10.358
Yo, those ain't free.

00:10.445 --> 00:13.404
Um, okay. Um.

00:13.491 --> 00:16.190
Yeah, can I just
get a coffee, black.

00:18.931 --> 00:19.889
Oh, man.

00:22.718 --> 00:23.588
Thank you.

00:28.202 --> 00:30.334
Hey, Jubal, sorry,
I'm running late.

00:30.421 --> 00:34.034
Some crazy guy
threw his coffee at me.

00:34.121 --> 00:36.558
<i>The police came.
It was a whole thing.</i>

00:36.645 --> 00:38.299
But you know,
justice was served.

00:38.386 --> 00:40.214
The cops ordered
the guy to apologize

00:40.301 --> 00:41.954
and pay my dry cleaning bill.

00:42.042 --> 00:43.521
Uh-huh. And did he?

00:43.608 --> 00:45.480
The guy gave me 25Â¢.

00:45.567 --> 00:46.916
The police said
that was enough,

00:47.003 --> 00:48.744
and he was sent
on his merry way.

00:48.831 --> 00:50.354
Well, that's why
you're an analyst

00:50.441 --> 00:52.530
and not a special agent.
- What's that supposed to mean?

00:52.617 --> 00:54.663
Agents don't let crazy people
throw coffee at them, man.

00:54.750 --> 00:56.099
They just don't.
- Yeah.

00:56.186 --> 00:57.013
I don't think that
that's actually--

00:57.100 --> 00:59.537
Relax. I'm kidding. Sort of.

00:59.624 --> 01:00.669
<i>I'll see you in a bit.</i>

01:14.465 --> 01:16.119
Is everything okay?

01:16.206 --> 01:17.164
I thought I heard
someone screaming and--

01:17.251 --> 01:18.513
Don't move.

01:18.600 --> 01:19.949
Don't say a word
or I'll shoot you.

01:20.036 --> 01:21.429
Get down.
Get down on the ground.

01:21.516 --> 01:22.865
Get down on the ground
with the others.

01:22.952 --> 01:24.649
You heard her.
Get over here, now.

01:24.736 --> 01:28.305
Okay, look, look, look,
there's no need to be--

01:32.353 --> 01:34.790
No more talking
or you're a dead man.

01:42.885 --> 01:44.016
What do you mean
you can't do it?

01:44.104 --> 01:46.062
Huh?
It can't be that difficult.

01:46.149 --> 01:47.498
It's all computerized.

01:47.585 --> 01:49.370
I don't have access
to the codes.

01:49.457 --> 01:51.241
I'm sorry.

01:51.328 --> 01:54.766
Okay, then we need
to get access to them.

01:54.853 --> 01:56.942
In the meantime, you need
to lock the front door.

01:57.029 --> 01:58.466
Make it look like
the bank is closed.

01:58.553 --> 01:59.902
Come on, move.

02:10.869 --> 02:12.306
Wait, wait, he asked you
to split the bill?

02:12.393 --> 02:13.872
No, it was worse.

02:13.959 --> 02:15.439
He went line by line.

02:15.526 --> 02:17.833
You ordered the branzino,
I had the chicken.

02:17.920 --> 02:19.661
Wow, well,
he sounds very thorough.

02:19.748 --> 02:21.619
And if you see him
again, you are fired.

02:21.706 --> 02:23.708
I mean it.

02:31.673 --> 02:34.197
Isobel, you need to get
to the JOC right away.

02:34.284 --> 02:36.025
All right, so one
of our own is being

02:36.112 --> 02:38.158
held hostage at Trust
National Bank in Brooklyn,

02:38.245 --> 02:39.507
and every move we make,

02:39.594 --> 02:41.509
every action we take
needs to be precise

02:41.596 --> 02:43.467
and needs to end
with Kelly Moran

02:43.554 --> 02:45.774
and the rest of the hostages
walking out of there unharmed.

02:45.861 --> 02:47.950
Do we have access
to the bank security cameras?

02:48.037 --> 02:49.560
Almost there.

02:49.647 --> 02:50.648
Got it.

02:50.735 --> 02:52.607
Okay, okay, here we go.

02:52.694 --> 02:55.044
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:55.131 --> 02:57.177
Okay, can you zoom in
to this one right here, please?

03:01.268 --> 03:02.747
There's Kelly.

03:02.834 --> 03:05.402
Are these masks gonna stop us
from getting facial rec?

03:05.489 --> 03:06.403
Trying now.

03:08.579 --> 03:10.886
No hits.
- Okay.

03:10.973 --> 03:12.975
Everybody, take out
your cell phones

03:13.062 --> 03:14.716
and throw them in the center
of the carpet right here.

03:14.803 --> 03:15.804
Now, everyone.

03:15.891 --> 03:17.022
We're not gonna ask again.

03:17.109 --> 03:19.329
We want everyone's phone now.

03:19.416 --> 03:20.678
If we find a phone
in your pocket,

03:20.765 --> 03:23.681
if we hear a ring or a buzz,
we will shoot you.

03:25.944 --> 03:27.076
Where's your phone?

03:27.163 --> 03:29.296
Yeah, I--I must have
left it at home.

03:29.383 --> 03:31.733
I--I was rushing
to the cleaner, and I--

03:31.820 --> 03:33.082
I must have--
- Stand up.

03:38.957 --> 03:40.524
Hey, look at my shirt.
I spilled coffee all over it.

03:40.611 --> 03:43.005
Just stop talking.

03:43.092 --> 03:44.398
I hope you're
telling the truth.

03:54.146 --> 03:55.365
Take your jacket off, slowly.

03:57.715 --> 03:59.064
Throw it on the floor.

04:08.335 --> 04:09.292
Sit down.

04:15.516 --> 04:17.126
I'm glad.

04:17.213 --> 04:19.128
I don't wanna shoot anyone.

04:19.215 --> 04:21.173
I swear to God.

04:21.261 --> 04:22.871
But I will.

04:31.053 --> 04:32.968
Come on, you're the
bank manager, okay?

04:33.055 --> 04:35.100
I need to get in here.

04:35.187 --> 04:36.972
Tell me you found something.

04:38.756 --> 04:40.323
No.

04:40.410 --> 04:41.890
I'm sorry.
- Wrong answer.

04:43.718 --> 04:45.894
Bradley.

04:45.981 --> 04:47.983
Look, I know you're upset,
but there's nothing I can do.

04:48.070 --> 04:50.290
But I can give you money.

04:50.377 --> 04:51.508
We don't care about money.

04:51.595 --> 04:53.293
We need what's in
that safe deposit box.

04:53.380 --> 04:55.686
Okay,
like I keep telling you,

04:55.773 --> 04:57.340
I can't access the box

04:57.427 --> 04:59.560
without the customer's
ocular biometrics.

04:59.647 --> 05:00.909
What the hell
does that even mean?

05:00.996 --> 05:03.564
The security system needs
to scan the person's eyes.

05:03.651 --> 05:06.175
Okay, there's--
there's no other way.

05:06.262 --> 05:07.916
The customer needs
to be here in person.

05:11.049 --> 05:13.922
What the hell?
Did you call the police?

05:14.009 --> 05:15.315
No. No, I swear.

05:15.402 --> 05:16.620
I--I've been here
the whole time.

05:16.707 --> 05:17.882
You would have seen me.

05:34.508 --> 05:37.598
If anyone moves an inch,
we will shoot you, understand?

05:41.166 --> 05:42.777
All right,
we're on the scene.

05:42.864 --> 05:44.518
Have Scola establish
a line of communication,

05:44.605 --> 05:45.954
and you head down there
as well.

05:46.041 --> 05:46.781
Who knows what these lunatics
have in mind.

05:46.868 --> 05:49.523
Yeah.

05:49.610 --> 05:51.263
Get the snipers in position.
Set up a containment.

05:51.351 --> 05:54.092
100-yard radius.

05:54.179 --> 05:56.312
This is Special Agent Scola
with the FBI.

05:56.399 --> 05:57.444
I'd like to talk to you.

06:01.317 --> 06:03.624
I'll go get the hostage
negotiation phone.

06:03.711 --> 06:05.930
We're gonna leave a phone
at the front door.

06:06.017 --> 06:07.584
We will not attempt
to enter the building.

06:07.671 --> 06:09.412
You have my word.

06:09.499 --> 06:12.502
I just wanna talk to you,
figure a way out of this.

06:12.589 --> 06:13.721
Any audio?

06:13.808 --> 06:14.722
We gotta hear what
they're saying.

06:14.809 --> 06:16.419
Let me try.

06:16.506 --> 06:18.813
Mm, negative.
It's a video feed only.

06:22.120 --> 06:23.992
There has to be
a way to do this.

06:24.079 --> 06:26.124
There is, but the person

06:26.211 --> 06:28.605
who actually rents the box
needs to be here.

06:28.692 --> 06:30.955
Well, he's not available,
okay, so stop saying that.

06:31.042 --> 06:33.088
I'm just--I'm telling you
that's the only way.

06:33.175 --> 06:34.306
Can you call someone
at the bank

06:34.394 --> 06:37.527
and ask them to open box 1340?

06:37.614 --> 06:38.180
What are you waiting for?
Start calling.

06:38.267 --> 06:39.790
Get us inside that box.

07:01.246 --> 07:03.858
Box owner's name
is Rafael Salazar.

07:03.945 --> 07:06.817
Started renting the safe
deposit box three months ago.

07:06.904 --> 07:08.645
Okay, what else
do we know about him?

07:08.732 --> 07:09.907
Born and raised
on Long Island.

07:09.994 --> 07:11.431
Currently lives in Oyster Bay.

07:11.518 --> 07:14.172
Looks like he works in finance.

07:14.259 --> 07:16.087
Okay, good.

07:16.174 --> 07:18.133
Now we know whose safe deposit
box they are trying to access.

07:18.220 --> 07:19.743
We just need to figure out
the why

07:19.830 --> 07:21.528
and how they are connected.

07:24.618 --> 07:26.750
I got two security cameras
across the street.

07:26.837 --> 07:29.361
Let's go check them out.

07:29.449 --> 07:30.711
The bank opens up at 9:00,

07:30.798 --> 07:32.626
so I'd say
they showed up around 8:30.

07:32.713 --> 07:34.323
Okay.

07:36.891 --> 07:37.935
Right there.

07:40.285 --> 07:41.896
Can you go back to the car
and blow that up?

07:47.858 --> 07:49.512
Okay, can you fast forward
until you see their faces

07:49.599 --> 07:50.992
and then blow that up, too, please?

07:51.079 --> 07:51.993
Got it.

07:58.478 --> 08:00.044
- Perfect.
- Thanks.

08:02.612 --> 08:05.006
Okay, just got a hit
on the car.

08:05.093 --> 08:07.617
It belongs to the safe deposit
owner, Rafael Salazar.

08:07.704 --> 08:09.576
All right, well, now we know
they are both connected

08:09.663 --> 08:11.316
to him somehow.

08:11.403 --> 08:13.318
Just ran the facial images
OA sent over.

08:13.405 --> 08:16.191
The male's name is
Marco Salazar, age 37.

08:16.278 --> 08:18.802
He's the only child
of Rafael Salazar.

08:18.889 --> 08:21.457
The female is Jennifer Salazar.
It's Marco's wife.

08:21.544 --> 08:23.111
They lived in Texas
for a while.

08:23.198 --> 08:24.721
Neither one
has a criminal record.

08:24.808 --> 08:26.201
All right,
where do they live now?

08:26.288 --> 08:28.029
Same Oyster Bay address
as Rafael.

08:28.116 --> 08:30.422
Okay, let's get Maggie
and OA over there right away.

08:30.510 --> 08:32.686
In the meantime, keep digging
into Marco and Jennifer.

08:32.773 --> 08:35.906
I wanna know everything we can
about these two, who they are,

08:35.993 --> 08:39.736
what they do, and what they ate
for breakfast, now.

08:39.823 --> 08:41.477
We're heading up
to Long Island.

08:41.564 --> 08:42.870
Gunman's father lives up there.

08:42.957 --> 08:45.350
Maybe he knows
what the hell is going on.

08:45.437 --> 08:46.613
The hostage phone
is by the door.

08:46.700 --> 08:49.790
Okay. That's it. Thank you.

08:49.877 --> 08:52.009
All right, so if he
picks up the phone,

08:52.096 --> 08:54.359
let's get him talking about his
father, see what we can learn.

08:54.446 --> 08:57.406
But first things first,
get him to pick up.

08:57.493 --> 08:58.538
Copy that.

09:02.803 --> 09:04.805
It's Agent Scola.

09:04.892 --> 09:06.197
There's a phone at the door.

09:06.284 --> 09:07.982
Please, just answer it, okay?

09:08.069 --> 09:10.071
It'll help us communicate.

09:10.158 --> 09:12.290
Help us figure something out.

09:14.118 --> 09:16.512
All right, here he comes.

09:16.599 --> 09:18.122
You, come with me.

09:18.209 --> 09:19.384
What?

09:26.870 --> 09:27.610
Grab the phone!

09:31.048 --> 09:32.223
Let's talk.

09:35.139 --> 09:36.097
Grab it.

09:36.184 --> 09:37.489
Let me help you.

09:40.754 --> 09:43.147
- Do we have a shot?
<i>- It's too risky.</i>

09:43.234 --> 09:44.714
<i>Two suspects
and multiple hostages.</i>

09:48.413 --> 09:49.763
Get down.

10:09.173 --> 10:10.479
Hello?

10:10.566 --> 10:13.613
Marco, Agent Scola.

10:13.700 --> 10:15.919
How--how do you know my name?

10:16.006 --> 10:17.355
<i>We're the FBI, Marco.</i>

10:17.442 --> 10:19.706
We do this for a living.
We know a lot of things.

10:19.793 --> 10:21.011
<i>Okay, we also have access</i>

10:21.098 --> 10:22.883
<i>to a lot
of different information.</i>

10:22.970 --> 10:24.580
<i>It's a good thing.</i>

10:24.667 --> 10:27.104
It means that we can help you
and your wife, Jennifer.

10:27.191 --> 10:28.497
Also means we can negotiate.

10:28.584 --> 10:30.717
I don't wanna negotiate.

10:30.804 --> 10:33.197
I want a locksmith,
an expert locksmith,

10:33.284 --> 10:35.156
someone who could break
into a computerized,

10:35.243 --> 10:37.332
state-of-the-art
safe deposit box.

10:37.419 --> 10:39.203
And--and I want zip ties.

10:39.290 --> 10:41.249
<i>Okay. That's easy.</i>

10:41.336 --> 10:43.730
We can find a locksmith, get
you some zip ties, all right?

10:43.817 --> 10:45.296
But in the meantime,
please, just try

10:45.383 --> 10:47.864
and stay calm, all right?
You don't wanna hurt anyone.

10:47.951 --> 10:49.736
It's only gonna
make things worse.

10:51.651 --> 10:54.436
Things can't get
any worse, not for us.

10:58.266 --> 11:01.312
Just--just get us
that locksmith.

11:01.399 --> 11:05.316
If he does what we need him
to do, everyone lives.

11:05.403 --> 11:06.666
If he doesn't, everyone dies.

11:32.953 --> 11:34.911
Hell of a place.

11:34.998 --> 11:36.913
FBI.

11:37.000 --> 11:38.785
We're looking
for Rafael Salazar.

11:42.310 --> 11:43.659
Hello?

11:43.746 --> 11:45.487
Mr. Salazar? This is the FBI.

11:45.574 --> 11:48.751
We need to talk, now.

11:48.838 --> 11:51.058
Isobel, no one seems to be
home and the door's locked.

11:51.145 --> 11:52.929
His father may be involved
in the crime.

11:53.016 --> 11:54.539
Exigent circumstances.

11:54.626 --> 11:56.498
Just get in there
and get me some answers.

12:03.331 --> 12:05.028
FBI.

12:05.115 --> 12:06.769
Anybody home?

12:20.783 --> 12:23.003
OA, get up here right away.

12:30.880 --> 12:32.055
He's dead.

12:34.797 --> 12:36.146
Doesn't look like
it was a pleasant one, either.

12:36.233 --> 12:38.366
No.

12:38.453 --> 12:39.671
Thank you.

12:39.759 --> 12:43.153
Hey, so the male gunman's
father is dead.

12:43.240 --> 12:44.938
Maggie and OA just found
his body at his estate

12:45.025 --> 12:46.766
in Long Island,
and it looks like

12:46.853 --> 12:47.375
he was pretty badly beaten.

12:49.681 --> 12:51.074
That's him.

12:51.161 --> 12:52.859
Marco, listen,
all right, I'm gonna need

12:52.946 --> 12:54.686
a little more time, okay?

12:54.774 --> 12:56.166
No more stalling.

12:56.253 --> 12:57.211
You want me to prove
I'm serious?

12:57.298 --> 12:59.517
No, listen,
that's a bad idea.

13:00.910 --> 13:02.259
He hung up.

13:02.346 --> 13:04.348
We need to find
this damn locksmith.

13:04.435 --> 13:05.480
I called the tech squad,
but their guy's

13:05.567 --> 13:07.438
all the way in New Haven.
- We don't have time.

13:07.525 --> 13:08.875
We need someone now
or he's gonna start shooting.

13:08.962 --> 13:10.746
Where's that damn locksmith?

13:10.833 --> 13:11.878
We're running out of time.

13:23.715 --> 13:25.326
I just got a text message
from Kelly.

13:32.333 --> 13:33.900
You.

13:33.987 --> 13:36.598
Stand up.

13:36.685 --> 13:38.905
- You want me to stand up?
- Yes, now.

13:52.701 --> 13:54.355
Look, I already told you, okay,

13:54.442 --> 13:56.574
I need another 15 minutes.

13:56.661 --> 13:58.794
<i>You have exactly 15 minutes.</i>

13:58.881 --> 14:00.840
<i>If I don't have a locksmith,</i>

14:00.927 --> 14:02.580
<i>I'm gonna shoot this guy
right here.</i>

14:07.063 --> 14:09.761
You'll get a locksmith,
okay, and a good one.

14:09.849 --> 14:10.937
<i>I promise you that.</i>

14:16.768 --> 14:18.422
This man is not playing.

14:28.432 --> 14:31.044
You sure about this, Jubal?

14:31.131 --> 14:34.482
Not really, but we don't
have a choice, do we?

14:34.569 --> 14:36.484
No.

14:36.571 --> 14:38.486
Hopefully, you won't
have to be in there long.

14:38.573 --> 14:40.749
Snipers are in position, okay?

14:40.836 --> 14:42.969
As discussed, just try
to find a way to draw Marco

14:43.056 --> 14:44.057
toward the front window.

14:44.144 --> 14:45.667
We'll take him out.

14:45.754 --> 14:47.799
You overpower the wife,
take her by surprise.

14:47.887 --> 14:50.802
Last thing she's expecting
is a locksmith to play hero.

15:24.445 --> 15:25.576
Come over here.
We need to pat you down.

15:25.663 --> 15:27.796
You wanna pat me down here?

15:27.883 --> 15:28.710
No, you come here.

15:28.797 --> 15:30.059
Okay.

15:33.758 --> 15:35.543
Over here.

15:35.630 --> 15:37.023
Okay, right there. Right there.
Drop your bags.

15:38.589 --> 15:40.069
Okay.

15:40.156 --> 15:42.332
I'm gonna pat you down, okay?

15:47.772 --> 15:49.774
Okay, he's clean.

15:49.861 --> 15:50.906
Open up your bags.

15:50.993 --> 15:52.473
- Okay.
- Yeah.

15:52.560 --> 15:54.692
Yeah. It's just my tools.

15:58.435 --> 16:00.742
- What's that?
- The FBI people gave me that.

16:00.829 --> 16:03.092
Step back.

16:03.179 --> 16:04.833
Zip ties.

16:04.920 --> 16:05.921
Okay, open this one.

16:06.008 --> 16:08.184
That's it.

16:08.271 --> 16:10.012
Okay, he's safe. No weapons.

16:11.579 --> 16:13.798
I need
a safe deposit box opened.

16:13.885 --> 16:16.410
Bank manager says you need
the customer's eyes in person,

16:16.497 --> 16:17.759
but there has to be
a way around that,

16:17.846 --> 16:19.456
you know what I mean?

16:19.543 --> 16:22.068
There's always a way.

16:22.155 --> 16:23.025
We can get the person
who pays for the box--

16:23.112 --> 16:24.722
No, that won't work.

16:24.809 --> 16:27.029
- Actually, it will.
- It won't work!

16:29.075 --> 16:31.599
Oh. Right.

16:31.686 --> 16:34.210
Well, we'll find another way.

16:34.297 --> 16:35.951
Good.
Good, I like your attitude.

16:36.038 --> 16:37.474
Yeah.

16:43.698 --> 16:45.439
Okay, is there anything else
I need to know?

16:45.526 --> 16:46.962
Yeah.

16:47.049 --> 16:48.442
We need you to get
inside that box

16:48.529 --> 16:50.357
within the next 30 minutes, yeah?

16:50.444 --> 16:52.576
30 minutes, huh? Okay.

16:52.663 --> 16:54.187
What are you looking at?

16:56.145 --> 16:58.495
- What--what's that?
- You keep looking around.

16:58.582 --> 17:00.671
I'm a little nervous here, man.

17:00.758 --> 17:04.588
You got guns pointed at me,
people sitting around.

17:04.675 --> 17:08.244
I mean, why don't you let
the rest of these people go?

17:08.331 --> 17:09.158
No, we're not
letting anyone go

17:09.245 --> 17:10.333
until you get inside that box.

17:10.420 --> 17:11.987
It's fine,
I'm just a locksmith

17:12.074 --> 17:13.206
trying to do a good deed here.

17:13.293 --> 17:15.730
Just come with me. Now.

17:15.817 --> 17:16.731
Yeah.

17:21.736 --> 17:23.303
1340.

17:23.390 --> 17:26.088
1340. Okay, um...

17:27.394 --> 17:28.525
Where is it...

17:28.612 --> 17:30.092
Okay, if anybody tries
to be a hero,

17:30.179 --> 17:32.094
I will shoot you, okay?

17:32.181 --> 17:36.142
So just stay down and let
the locksmith do his thing.

17:36.229 --> 17:38.622
Just don't move.

17:40.711 --> 17:41.973
Right.

17:49.764 --> 17:51.896
Are you good?

17:51.983 --> 17:56.336
I--yeah, it looks, you know,
pretty straightforward.

17:56.423 --> 17:57.554
Get to work.

18:02.168 --> 18:04.257
Ian's gonna walk you
through this step by step.

18:06.215 --> 18:08.565
This is doable, right?

18:08.652 --> 18:10.132
Yes.

18:10.219 --> 18:11.916
I think so.
- Try again.

18:12.003 --> 18:14.354
Yes, it's doable.

18:14.441 --> 18:15.964
I'm reading through
the protocols now.

18:16.051 --> 18:18.271
<i>In the meantime,
grab a USB cable</i>

18:18.358 --> 18:22.057
and plug your laptop into
that port in the wall panel.

18:22.144 --> 18:23.798
What's that gonna do?

18:23.885 --> 18:25.800
- Nothing.
- Come again?

18:25.887 --> 18:28.629
We need to buy time until
I talk to the bank's IT people

18:28.716 --> 18:30.587
and figure out how to do this,
so just pretend.

18:30.674 --> 18:33.373
Move your hands across
the keyboard,

18:33.460 --> 18:35.766
but don't actually
touch the keys.

18:35.853 --> 18:37.333
One misstep and the system
will shut down for 24 hours.

18:38.813 --> 18:40.510
Copy that.

18:40.597 --> 18:42.904
What are you doing, huh?
What are you doing?

18:42.991 --> 18:44.732
Go! Make it tighter!

18:44.819 --> 18:45.950
Sorry, hey.

18:46.037 --> 18:48.301
How's it going?

18:48.388 --> 18:50.041
It's going--going great
so far,

18:50.129 --> 18:52.914
but I need access
to the electrical panel.

18:53.001 --> 18:54.829
Hey, Bradley,
electrical panel.

18:54.916 --> 18:56.526
Go. Go.

18:56.613 --> 18:58.311
Quick.

19:01.009 --> 19:03.490
Come on, come on.
Hurry up, damn it.

19:03.577 --> 19:04.882
Go.

19:17.199 --> 19:18.766
Great. Thank you.

19:23.901 --> 19:25.251
How much longer?

19:28.079 --> 19:30.299
How--how long? Um.

19:30.386 --> 19:32.693
Let's see, well,
you know, first,

19:32.780 --> 19:35.174
I can't give you an exact
time frame, but I'm hoping--

19:35.261 --> 19:37.915
No. No, we need a guarantee.

19:38.002 --> 19:40.309
I--I can't--
I can't do that.

19:40.396 --> 19:42.137
I can't control every variable.

19:42.224 --> 19:44.661
How long?

19:44.748 --> 19:47.925
Just give him an answer
you can stand behind.

19:49.362 --> 19:50.580
20 minutes.

19:50.667 --> 19:53.366
Um, 20--20 minutes.

19:54.758 --> 19:56.020
- Okay.
- Yeah.

19:56.107 --> 19:58.849
That works.

19:58.936 --> 20:01.200
But if it takes 21,
you're a dead man.

20:17.651 --> 20:18.652
I mean, he was
obviously hit in the face,

20:18.739 --> 20:20.131
but gathering by the way
he's clutching his chest,

20:20.219 --> 20:21.829
I'd say it was a heart
attack that killed him.

20:21.916 --> 20:23.744
I found the room they keep
all the security footage in,

20:23.831 --> 20:26.181
but they tore out
all the cables.

20:26.268 --> 20:27.661
Stole the hard drive.

20:27.748 --> 20:28.879
Smart move.

20:28.966 --> 20:30.577
Look at this.

20:33.536 --> 20:34.624
- Where is she?
- I don't know.

20:34.711 --> 20:35.930
Cleared the whole house.

20:36.017 --> 20:38.715
- So she's missing?
- Or worse.

20:38.802 --> 20:40.151
We don't know
what these two are capable of.

20:42.719 --> 20:44.417
Hold on a second. Hold on.

20:44.504 --> 20:45.287
Is this is a camera?

20:47.724 --> 20:51.206
Is this is part of the
main security system?

20:51.293 --> 20:52.294
I don't think so.

20:54.296 --> 20:56.167
Looks like it's pointed
at this painting,

20:56.255 --> 20:57.821
probably
for insurance purposes.

20:57.908 --> 20:59.910
We need to get this footage
to the JOC right away.

21:04.175 --> 21:05.960
Ian, where are we?

21:06.047 --> 21:07.570
I'm on the phone with the
bank's cybersecurity team now.

21:07.657 --> 21:09.006
They're sending me
the information as we speak.

21:09.093 --> 21:11.574
Jubal, you need
to slow play the setup.

21:11.661 --> 21:14.185
<i>Ian will jump on
with instructions shortly.</i>

21:14.273 --> 21:16.013
Make them tighter.
It's too loose.

21:16.100 --> 21:17.537
See all this space?
Make it tighter.

21:21.932 --> 21:24.631
And how exactly would
you define "shortly"?

21:24.718 --> 21:26.589
We are moving
as fast as we can.

21:26.676 --> 21:29.331
Maggie and OA are in Oyster Bay
now trying to get information.

21:29.418 --> 21:31.377
<i>The more we know,
the better our odds.</i>

21:31.464 --> 21:32.552
Copy that.

21:37.774 --> 21:39.689
The footage from Salazar's
estate's downloading now.

21:39.776 --> 21:41.822
It's a motion-activated camera,
so not a lot to scrub.

21:41.909 --> 21:43.606
Should have something
in the next few minutes.

21:43.693 --> 21:46.174
Hobbs, anything
on Marco's father?

21:46.261 --> 21:48.655
Any financial reason that safe
deposit box is so important?

21:48.742 --> 21:50.874
He's opened up
numerous shell accounts

21:50.961 --> 21:53.660
over the last few months,
over a billion dollars' worth.

21:53.747 --> 21:56.532
- Originating where?
- Colombia.

21:56.619 --> 21:57.794
Sounds like his dad
might be washing money.

21:57.881 --> 21:59.492
Exactly.

21:59.579 --> 22:01.189
His most recent transaction
was a withdrawal

22:01.276 --> 22:03.583
from one of his
offshore accounts.

22:03.670 --> 22:05.846
$200 million.

22:05.933 --> 22:07.804
Did he transfer the money
to Trust National?

22:07.891 --> 22:10.024
No, he converted it
to cryptocurrency, Bitcoin.

22:10.111 --> 22:12.374
You don't need a bank for that,
just an access code.

22:15.986 --> 22:17.945
Like I told you before,
I don't wanna hurt anyone,

22:18.032 --> 22:20.034
but I will if I have to.

22:22.384 --> 22:24.038
So just do what I say.

22:27.171 --> 22:28.738
Isobel,
I can't keep stalling.

22:28.825 --> 22:31.741
I need Ian in my ear
pretty damn quick.

22:31.828 --> 22:33.003
All right, I'll keep pushing.

22:33.090 --> 22:35.049
All right. Just tell him.

22:52.371 --> 22:54.242
Isobel, there's a lot
going on here.

22:54.329 --> 22:57.506
I need Ian in my ear right now,
ready or not.

22:57.593 --> 22:59.378
- It's game time.
- Five minutes.

22:59.465 --> 23:00.683
We don't have five minutes.

23:00.770 --> 23:02.032
If I give Jubal
the wrong instructions,

23:02.119 --> 23:03.556
that metal grid will
slide into place

23:03.643 --> 23:04.992
and the whole system
will shut down.

23:05.079 --> 23:06.385
It'll make it impossible
to breach.

23:06.472 --> 23:08.169
You've got two minutes.

23:10.824 --> 23:12.608
Jubal, hang with me.
He's almost there.

23:12.695 --> 23:14.218
Got something.

23:14.305 --> 23:15.698
I've been scrolling
through the footage.

23:15.785 --> 23:16.569
Marco and Jennifer
didn't kill Rafael.

23:16.656 --> 23:18.745
- Then who did?
- These two.

23:30.583 --> 23:33.237
They're asking about
the money Salazar stole,

23:33.324 --> 23:35.936
but I still can't make out
what Salazar says before dying.

23:36.023 --> 23:37.894
Okay, stand by.

23:37.981 --> 23:40.157
I'm gonna try to enhance
the sound even more.

23:46.686 --> 23:48.731
The crypto key is in
the safe deposit box.

23:48.818 --> 23:50.254
So that's what
they're looking for.

23:50.341 --> 23:52.431
And these two men are holding
their daughter as collateral.

23:52.518 --> 23:54.345
Start scrubbing traffic cams
near Rafael's estate.

23:54.433 --> 23:58.349
Let's find this vehicle now.

23:58.437 --> 24:00.569
Hey, hey, what is this?
What are you doing?

24:00.656 --> 24:02.789
It's too loose.
Hey, what is this?

24:02.876 --> 24:05.139
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

24:05.226 --> 24:06.183
Make it tighter!

24:10.057 --> 24:11.754
These two are losing it fast.

24:11.841 --> 24:13.147
Ian, get on the comms.

24:13.234 --> 24:14.975
We're out of time.

24:15.062 --> 24:16.716
Okay.

24:16.803 --> 24:19.806
Connect the USB cord
to the main panel.

24:19.893 --> 24:21.547
Yeah, that's already done.

24:21.634 --> 24:23.244
Now, type in the bypass code.

24:25.202 --> 24:28.292
<i>It's 100288.</i>

24:28.379 --> 24:30.381
Good, now go
to the scanner and--

24:30.469 --> 24:32.949
<i>What's taking so long?</i>

24:33.036 --> 24:34.473
What's taking so long?

24:34.560 --> 24:37.040
Look, pal,
this is hard enough

24:37.127 --> 24:39.216
without you waving a gun around
and shouting at me.

24:39.303 --> 24:41.436
Okay, just get it open.

24:41.523 --> 24:43.612
Everything we care about
depends on it.

24:48.791 --> 24:50.358
I get it.

24:53.056 --> 24:54.275
I get it.

24:54.362 --> 24:55.798
Look, I know you're just
trying to help,

24:55.885 --> 24:58.409
but you're just making
the situation worse.

24:58.497 --> 24:59.628
Don't lecture me!

24:59.715 --> 25:01.456
You have no idea
what's happening!

25:01.543 --> 25:02.805
No, I know. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

25:02.892 --> 25:05.634
I'm just--I'm just saying,
let me do my job,

25:05.721 --> 25:08.507
and everyone will get
to go home safely, all right?

25:11.074 --> 25:12.293
Babe.

25:12.380 --> 25:14.425
Babe, babe, babe,
let him do it.

25:14.513 --> 25:16.732
Okay?
Just let him do his job, okay?

25:16.819 --> 25:18.952
We need to let him
get inside that box, okay?

25:31.747 --> 25:38.493
The scanner reset code
is 1029-63.

25:46.675 --> 25:47.633
What happened?
Why isn't it opening?

25:51.114 --> 25:53.377
Uh...

25:53.464 --> 25:55.815
I'm not sure.

25:57.512 --> 25:58.948
Jubal, did you
type in the dash?

25:59.035 --> 26:00.167
If not, that's why
it didn't open.

26:00.254 --> 26:01.560
<i>Try to stall.</i>

26:01.647 --> 26:02.909
<i>I'll see if there's
a workaround.</i>

26:02.996 --> 26:07.435
You know what, I think
I know what I did wrong.

26:07.522 --> 26:09.959
I just need a few more minutes.

26:10.046 --> 26:11.352
No, no, there's no time.

26:11.439 --> 26:12.658
I have to make a call
in 10 minutes.

26:12.745 --> 26:13.833
10 minutes.

26:13.920 --> 26:15.312
Okay, well,
that should be fine.

26:15.399 --> 26:17.663
I should be able to, uh,
fix it by then.

26:24.583 --> 26:25.888
Jubal, do not let him
use that crowbar.

26:25.975 --> 26:27.063
It'll cause the security grid
to activate.

26:27.150 --> 26:30.414
Uh, no, buddy,
you don't wanna be doing that.

26:30.501 --> 26:33.069
That's--that's gonna trigger
the emergency security system

26:33.156 --> 26:34.375
and the whole damn thing
is gonna shut down.

26:34.462 --> 26:37.073
Would you tell him, please?
- Marco, don't do that.

26:37.160 --> 26:38.727
I'm telling you,
this is not a good idea.

26:38.814 --> 26:41.338
Please.
- Jubal, you have to stop him.

26:41.425 --> 26:43.297
- What are you doing?
- I'm serious.

26:43.384 --> 26:44.385
You're just gonna make it impossible.

26:44.472 --> 26:46.387
No, Marco! Marco!

26:46.474 --> 26:47.518
It's not a good idea.

26:47.606 --> 26:49.999
No, no!
- No, no, no!

26:50.086 --> 26:52.611
No!

26:52.698 --> 26:55.265
No!

27:03.709 --> 27:06.146
What are we gonna do now?
You have to fix it.

27:23.511 --> 27:24.468
Okay, we--we can fix this.
We just need to stay calm.

27:24.555 --> 27:26.340
Well, then fix it!
Make it open!

27:26.427 --> 27:28.821
I will, I just need a--
a few minutes here.

27:28.908 --> 27:31.258
No! There's no time!
Open it now!

27:31.345 --> 27:32.694
You don't understand.

27:32.781 --> 27:34.000
If you don't open that thing,

27:34.087 --> 27:35.523
they're gonna kill
our daughter, okay?

27:35.610 --> 27:37.177
Okay. I didn't know.
Your daughter's in danger?

27:37.264 --> 27:38.874
Yes!

27:38.961 --> 27:39.788
Oh, no, no, no, no,
don't say anything.

27:39.875 --> 27:40.920
You're just gonna
make it worse.

27:41.007 --> 27:43.009
We don't have
any other option.

27:43.096 --> 27:44.445
I'm so sorry.

27:44.532 --> 27:46.099
Is that why--
is that why you're doing this?

27:46.186 --> 27:48.797
It doesn't matter.
Just open the damn box!

27:48.884 --> 27:51.234
We just need to be patient
and let the system reboot,

27:51.321 --> 27:54.760
and then I'm gonna
get you into your box.

27:54.847 --> 27:56.326
Jubal,
you've gotta stall them.

27:56.413 --> 27:57.893
<i>Ian's working on a fix
on this side.</i>

27:57.980 --> 27:59.808
Where are we the traffic cams?

27:59.895 --> 28:02.115
I caught a gray SUV
two blocks from the estate.

28:02.202 --> 28:04.595
It was moving away about the
time Marco entered the bank.

28:04.683 --> 28:07.250
Two males inside,
angle is not great,

28:07.337 --> 28:08.208
but by the profile
of the driver,

28:08.295 --> 28:09.600
I think it might be them.

28:09.688 --> 28:10.993
It looks like
there's a kid in the back.

28:11.080 --> 28:13.430
That's gotta be them.
Run the plate now.

28:13.517 --> 28:15.215
Comes back
to a rental company.

28:15.302 --> 28:17.347
Does the car have GPS?

28:17.434 --> 28:19.132
Yes.

28:19.219 --> 28:20.568
All right,
get me that location now.

28:20.655 --> 28:23.919
If we can rescue Marco's
daughter, we can end this.

28:24.006 --> 28:25.834
GPS shows the car
is stationary at Woodbury.

28:25.921 --> 28:27.793
Maggie and OA are just
minutes from that area.

28:30.491 --> 28:31.535
Isobel, is the car
still there?

28:31.622 --> 28:33.146
Yes.

28:33.233 --> 28:34.060
State troopers will
meet you there.

28:34.147 --> 28:36.105
They will hold wide
until you arrive.

28:36.192 --> 28:37.628
<i>Maggie,
this is a short window.</i>

28:37.716 --> 28:40.153
We've gotta get proof that
Marco's daughter is safe.

28:40.240 --> 28:42.372
It's the only way to end this
without any more violence.

28:42.459 --> 28:45.549
Copy that.
We'll keep you updated.

28:45.636 --> 28:48.291
You gotta get it open.
There's no other way.

28:48.378 --> 28:50.554
I can get it open.
That's not the problem.

28:50.641 --> 28:53.514
It's just that the metal grid
is blocking the boxes.

28:53.601 --> 28:55.124
No.
No, you have to fix this.

28:55.211 --> 28:57.779
We have to get that crypto key.

28:57.866 --> 28:59.389
They killed his father.

28:59.476 --> 29:01.783
Do you think they're gonna
hesitate to kill our daughter?

29:03.219 --> 29:05.091
I don't know.

29:05.178 --> 29:09.095
Um, do you think maybe I could
speak to the bank manager?

29:09.182 --> 29:10.879
- Bradley, hey.
- Yeah.

29:10.966 --> 29:12.315
Hey.

29:12.402 --> 29:15.318
Could you maybe override
the grid from here?

29:15.405 --> 29:16.276
No.

29:18.800 --> 29:20.889
But I can call
the IT department.

29:20.976 --> 29:23.109
Maybe they can help.

29:23.196 --> 29:24.806
Okay. Okay.

29:24.893 --> 29:26.852
Yeah, call them.

29:26.939 --> 29:28.157
That's good. That's good.

29:28.244 --> 29:30.899
We're gonna--
we're gonna get this done.

29:30.986 --> 29:32.379
Jubal,
Ian has already tried that.

29:32.466 --> 29:33.902
The bank can't do it remotely.

29:35.730 --> 29:37.123
Well, then,
we're all out of options.

29:37.210 --> 29:38.951
No, maybe not.

29:39.038 --> 29:41.431
We think we found the men that
are holding Marco's daughter.

29:41.518 --> 29:43.042
Hopefully, we can get her
on the phone shortly.

29:43.129 --> 29:44.130
If we can prove
that she is safe,

29:44.217 --> 29:46.828
they will have a reason
to surrender.

29:46.915 --> 29:50.266
I'll keep trying to stall
them until they find her.

29:50.353 --> 29:53.792
Well--well,
that's just not good enough.

29:53.879 --> 29:56.664
Well, I need to speak
to your supervisor.

29:56.751 --> 29:59.058
Well, there has to be a way.

29:59.145 --> 30:00.015
What the hell
are they saying?

30:00.102 --> 30:01.495
Just--I'm trying.

30:01.582 --> 30:03.366
Please, just give me
a few more seconds, okay?

30:03.453 --> 30:04.411
Give me the phone.
I'll talk to them myself.

30:04.498 --> 30:06.239
No, no, that won't work.
Please--

30:06.326 --> 30:07.588
Will they listen to me now?

30:07.675 --> 30:08.894
Hey, hey!

30:08.981 --> 30:10.460
He's just trying to--

30:14.116 --> 30:15.117
What?

30:17.816 --> 30:18.947
What the hell is that?

30:22.298 --> 30:23.952
It's nothing.

30:24.039 --> 30:25.693
That's just the--it's a way
for the security center

30:25.780 --> 30:28.000
to be able to talk to me,
help me through.

30:28.087 --> 30:30.524
Are you--

30:30.611 --> 30:32.047
are you a cop?

30:32.134 --> 30:35.007
You've been playing us,
wasting time.

30:47.933 --> 30:50.065
Tell Scola and Tiff
to prepare to make entry.

30:50.152 --> 30:50.849
Stage, but wait for my command.

30:50.936 --> 30:53.112
Got it.

30:59.858 --> 31:01.207
Things have deteriorated.

31:01.294 --> 31:02.599
Prepare to make entry.

31:02.686 --> 31:03.992
There's no easy way
to say this.

31:04.079 --> 31:05.385
If we do, there's a good chance

31:05.472 --> 31:06.908
he'll kill a few
of those hostages.

31:06.995 --> 31:10.564
And if we don't,
there's 100% chance.

31:10.651 --> 31:12.261
Copy that.

31:16.265 --> 31:17.658
Just tell me who you are.

31:17.745 --> 31:19.529
I'm an FBI agent.

31:19.616 --> 31:21.053
That's a good thing, Marco,

31:21.140 --> 31:24.186
because we're about
to find your daughter.

31:24.273 --> 31:26.928
- You know where she is?
- Yeah. We're close.

31:27.015 --> 31:29.017
And we are going to find her.

31:29.104 --> 31:32.020
Now, look, we know your father
was tortured and killed,

31:32.107 --> 31:34.283
and we know you're trying
to retrieve a crypto key,

31:34.370 --> 31:36.677
and most of all, we know
you're doing all of this

31:36.764 --> 31:37.896
to save your little girl.

31:37.983 --> 31:40.289
We understand.

31:40.376 --> 31:42.204
My father, he got greedy.

31:42.291 --> 31:45.077
He put us all in danger.

31:45.164 --> 31:46.817
Yeah, they showed us
what they did to him,

31:46.905 --> 31:48.558
and they said that they would
do the exact same thing

31:48.645 --> 31:50.386
to our daughter
if we didn't get

31:50.473 --> 31:52.562
the crypto key out of the box.

31:52.649 --> 31:55.348
So we have to get that code
in the next five minutes,

31:55.435 --> 31:56.479
or they're absolutely
gonna kill her.

31:56.566 --> 31:58.220
I know. We understand.
We understand.

31:58.307 --> 31:59.091
So why don't you put
the weapons down,

31:59.178 --> 32:01.136
let these people go,
and work with us

32:01.223 --> 32:02.485
to save your little girl.

32:02.572 --> 32:03.965
No, no, no, you're lying.

32:04.052 --> 32:05.793
Just like you lied
about being a locksmith.

32:05.880 --> 32:07.577
No, no, this is different.

32:07.664 --> 32:10.711
We're on the same page now, Marco.

32:10.798 --> 32:13.409
What are they saying?
Can they fix this?

32:13.496 --> 32:15.063
No.

32:15.150 --> 32:16.369
They can't.

32:19.807 --> 32:20.808
Our baby.

32:20.895 --> 32:22.766
Our baby.

32:22.853 --> 32:26.205
No, no, no,
they're gonna kill her.

32:26.292 --> 32:27.771
They're not gonna kill her
if you work with us.

32:27.858 --> 32:30.252
They're gonna kill her.

32:30.339 --> 32:31.471
No, no, they're gonna kill her.
They're gonna kill her.

32:31.558 --> 32:32.863
Jennifer, listen to me.

32:32.951 --> 32:36.084
Work with us,
and we can save your child.

32:36.171 --> 32:38.304
If you work with us,
we can save your little girl.

32:38.391 --> 32:40.654
They're gonna kill her!

32:40.741 --> 32:42.351
No!

32:42.438 --> 32:44.484
Listen to me.

32:44.571 --> 32:46.616
We didn't wanna do this,
I swear.

32:46.703 --> 32:48.967
I know.

32:58.802 --> 33:00.543
No one move! No one!

33:13.904 --> 33:15.036
Maggie, how close are you
to the kidnappers?

33:15.123 --> 33:17.256
These two are losing control.

33:17.343 --> 33:18.909
<i>We're arriving
on location now.</i>

33:18.997 --> 33:20.911
Marco, you need to relax.

33:20.999 --> 33:22.174
We didn't ask for this.

33:22.261 --> 33:24.785
All we wanted
was to save our kid.

33:24.872 --> 33:26.265
Okay, you need to release me
right now so I can help him.

33:26.352 --> 33:28.310
Otherwise,
he's going to bleed out.

33:28.397 --> 33:29.442
He's the one that tried
to grab the gun,

33:29.529 --> 33:30.921
tried to be a hero.

33:31.009 --> 33:32.401
That may be, but you
do not want him to die.

33:40.366 --> 33:41.584
FBI, don't do it!

33:42.890 --> 33:44.065
Shots fired.

33:55.990 --> 33:57.209
Show me your hands!

34:04.303 --> 34:05.652
Drop your weapon!

34:17.272 --> 34:18.186
Man down.

34:21.407 --> 34:22.103
Keep your hands
where I can see them.

34:26.281 --> 34:27.587
Cover me.

34:31.330 --> 34:32.418
OA, she's here.

34:32.505 --> 34:34.115
She alive?

34:34.202 --> 34:35.464
Ella?

34:35.551 --> 34:36.857
Ella?

34:41.035 --> 34:43.081
She's breathing,
but she's heavily sedated.

34:45.692 --> 34:47.476
<i>Hey, it's Maggie.</i>

34:47.563 --> 34:49.348
<i>I need multiple ambulances
at this location immediately.</i>

34:50.523 --> 34:52.655
Marco.

34:52.742 --> 34:54.831
I've got good news.
Your daughter's safe.

35:08.845 --> 35:11.065
Show me.
Where is she?

35:11.152 --> 35:13.763
Agents are bringing her
down here as we speak,

35:13.850 --> 35:16.114
so why don't you
put the gun down?

35:16.201 --> 35:17.898
We'll end this.
- No! No!

35:17.985 --> 35:20.379
We need proof.

35:20.466 --> 35:24.557
I don't have any,
not yet, but I will soon.

35:24.644 --> 35:28.691
In the meantime, why don't you
let the hostages go?

35:30.519 --> 35:31.738
So she's dead?

35:31.825 --> 35:33.218
Is that what you're saying?

35:33.305 --> 35:35.350
No, Marco,
I already told you.

35:35.437 --> 35:37.744
The--
- Then put her on the phone!

35:48.102 --> 35:49.669
<i>What are the paramedics
saying?</i>

35:49.756 --> 35:51.845
She's been sedated.
They gave her muscle relaxers.

35:51.932 --> 35:54.674
Well, can they give her
adrenaline to wake her up?

35:54.761 --> 35:56.328
No.
They advised against it.

35:56.415 --> 35:57.807
They said it would be
way too dangerous.

36:00.114 --> 36:02.160
Okay, what if we take
a video of her?

36:02.247 --> 36:03.813
We show them that she's safe.
We have her.

36:03.900 --> 36:05.206
Maybe they'll put
the guns down.

36:05.293 --> 36:06.947
They'll walk out.
- We can't take the chance.

36:07.034 --> 36:08.862
They're spiraling.

36:08.949 --> 36:10.168
If they see their daughter's
lying there motionless,

36:10.255 --> 36:11.691
they will assume she's dead.

36:11.778 --> 36:13.562
Just keep me in the loop.

36:13.649 --> 36:15.347
<i>I have to know the moment
her status changes.</i>

36:18.654 --> 36:21.222
Eyes down. Don't move.
Don't move. Nobody move!

36:21.309 --> 36:23.485
Down!

36:23.572 --> 36:25.444
Tiff, this isn't sustainable.
They're both too volatile.

36:25.531 --> 36:27.359
<i>Make entry now.</i>
- Copy that.

36:36.281 --> 36:38.979
<i>Don't move. Stay down.</i>

36:39.066 --> 36:41.111
Quit moving! Eyes down!

36:41.199 --> 36:43.462
Marco, I know them.

36:43.549 --> 36:46.073
If they're telling you
your daughter is safe, she is.

36:46.160 --> 36:48.206
Shut up.
I've had enough of your lies.

36:53.123 --> 36:54.821
Hey, hey, hey,
he's not lying.

37:01.610 --> 37:04.787
No, what the hell
are you doing?

37:04.874 --> 37:07.268
What he's saying is true.

37:07.355 --> 37:09.662
I have agents on the phone.

37:09.749 --> 37:11.054
They're with your child
right now.

37:13.100 --> 37:15.320
Talk to them.

37:15.407 --> 37:18.801
They'll let you speak to her,
and let's just end this.

37:20.542 --> 37:22.849
Why would the agents
call you?

37:22.936 --> 37:24.981
Because I'm with the FBI too.

37:26.809 --> 37:29.377
And these agents,
they have my daughter?

37:29.464 --> 37:30.987
Yeah.

37:31.074 --> 37:32.641
Yes, just take the phone.

37:32.728 --> 37:33.338
Speak to your daughter.

37:35.209 --> 37:37.472
You'll see for yourself.

37:37.559 --> 37:40.693
- If you're lying--
- I'm not.

37:40.780 --> 37:42.956
I'm so damn nervous
I'm gonna drop this phone.

37:52.835 --> 37:55.751
Hello?

37:55.838 --> 37:57.449
Hello? Baby, are you there?

37:57.536 --> 37:58.754
Can you hear me?

38:02.062 --> 38:03.237
- Hands up!
- Drop the weapon now!

38:09.809 --> 38:11.332
Drop the gun. Drop it!

38:11.419 --> 38:12.986
Put your hands up!
Turn around!

38:15.815 --> 38:17.164
We need a medic in here!

38:18.905 --> 38:21.255
Just so you know,
we weren't lying, all right?

38:21.342 --> 38:22.474
Your daughter's safe.

38:33.354 --> 38:34.834
You're okay, all right?

38:34.921 --> 38:36.575
Let it go.

38:36.662 --> 38:37.924
You did good, Kelly.

38:38.011 --> 38:39.839
Thanks. Thanks.

38:42.189 --> 38:43.277
Now I think I'm gonna go
throw up.

38:43.364 --> 38:45.714
Take a deep breath.

38:45.801 --> 38:47.977
You're all right.
It's just the adrenaline.

39:09.999 --> 39:11.000
Hey.

39:11.087 --> 39:13.002
Hey.

39:13.089 --> 39:14.743
You okay?

39:14.830 --> 39:18.573
Hey, is, uh,
is their kid really safe?

39:18.660 --> 39:20.314
Yeah.
She's recovering well.

39:20.401 --> 39:22.664
Once the doctor clears her,

39:22.751 --> 39:26.364
Marco's sister has agreed
to take custody.

39:26.451 --> 39:27.408
Hey.

39:29.192 --> 39:31.238
That bluff,

39:31.325 --> 39:33.109
daughter on the phone...

39:35.503 --> 39:37.940
It was good.

39:38.027 --> 39:39.551
Took a lot of courage.

39:42.684 --> 39:45.600
I wasn't really thinking.
I just--

39:45.687 --> 39:46.949
Probably a good thing.

39:49.952 --> 39:51.737
Out in the field,
sometimes thinking too much

39:51.824 --> 39:54.566
can get you into trouble.

39:54.653 --> 39:57.569
Yeah.
Yeah, good--good to know.

40:00.659 --> 40:03.575
You, uh, you saved a lot
of lives today.

40:07.100 --> 40:08.449
Including mine.

40:10.146 --> 40:11.365
Thanks.

40:15.325 --> 40:17.502
Get that shirt cleaned.
