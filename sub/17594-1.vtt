02:57.946 --> 02:59.470
Oh, I'm sorry.

03:00.182 --> 03:02.013
It's so hot in here...

03:02.084 --> 03:04.917
and I can't figure
this stupid thing out.

03:06.855 --> 03:08.652
I signed the papers.

03:10.559 --> 03:11.617
Wow.

03:14.563 --> 03:16.053
How are you feeling?

03:17.032 --> 03:18.329
Terrible.

03:19.701 --> 03:22.534
Francis was there.
Obviously, he was there.

03:23.739 --> 03:25.639
It was really hard to see him.

03:27.276 --> 03:29.176
And he signed so fast.

03:29.444 --> 03:32.902
I at least pretended to look
things over one last time.

03:33.148 --> 03:35.139
He sounds terrified to me.

03:36.485 --> 03:38.544
It's going to take a while.

03:39.087 --> 03:40.577
I mean, nine years, Rafi.

03:40.656 --> 03:43.784
You can't just walk away
from that kind of time.

03:46.562 --> 03:48.189
The crazy thing is...

03:49.331 --> 03:52.664
I'm out of this marriage,
what, five minutes...

03:53.202 --> 03:55.500
and all of a sudden I just...

03:58.974 --> 04:01.340
I find myself thinking about...

04:03.011 --> 04:04.273
a baby.

04:04.813 --> 04:08.180
Why now? And why didn't I think
about this when I was married?

04:08.951 --> 04:10.009
Well, I mean, you know...

04:10.085 --> 04:13.816
on a certain level, you knew
this was not the right man.

04:14.656 --> 04:16.783
So you were protecting
yourself in that way.

04:16.858 --> 04:18.451
That was a good thing.

04:19.361 --> 04:22.330
Oh, Rafi, you're coming alive again.

04:22.631 --> 04:24.826
You know, you just
want all the things...

04:24.900 --> 04:27.767
that you had to forget
that you could have.

04:28.303 --> 04:31.067
That's a very good place to move into.

04:31.673 --> 04:34.369
And the baby thing will happen...

04:34.910 --> 04:36.639
when it's the right time.

04:37.112 --> 04:39.478
But just focus on the now.

04:40.949 --> 04:42.211
For now.

04:50.525 --> 04:52.789
Hey, Dave, it's Morris...

04:52.995 --> 04:55.054
Listen, I got a favor to ask you.

04:55.130 --> 04:57.189
I went out with this
girl the other night.

04:57.266 --> 05:00.793
And she told me never to call
her again. You know how that goes.

05:00.869 --> 05:03.303
So I'm gonna need you to
come with me this time.

05:03.372 --> 05:05.169
Don't freak out, all right?

05:05.240 --> 05:08.403
I don't know how to get
to Bay Ridge. I'm not sure.

05:08.677 --> 05:09.735
Bye.

05:11.947 --> 05:14.438
I don't understand why I
have to be a part of this.

05:14.516 --> 05:16.313
You have an incurable sickness.

05:16.385 --> 05:18.114
It's okay, though. I understand.

05:18.186 --> 05:20.017
But why am I being involved?

05:20.088 --> 05:22.283
- How are you being involved?
- Because I'm in the car.

05:22.357 --> 05:25.190
I'm going to be a witness to
this. That makes me an accessory.

05:25.260 --> 05:27.490
What, like a handbag? Morris.

05:28.063 --> 05:29.325
So who's it this time?

05:29.398 --> 05:31.798
You know what? Don't... I
don't wanna know. Don't tell me.

05:31.867 --> 05:34.859
Her father's probably in
waste management or something.

05:34.937 --> 05:37.906
What I would like to know is why
no girl will go out with you twice.

05:37.973 --> 05:40.533
One date, it's over. What
do you do? What do you say?

05:40.609 --> 05:42.770
You know, it's a mystery to me, too.

05:46.982 --> 05:50.076
Are you a hermaphrodite?
Do you have hantavirus?

05:50.485 --> 05:52.043
This is it. Come on.

05:53.255 --> 05:54.415
All right, just make this quick.

05:54.489 --> 05:56.252
I gotta meet Michelle at
the movies a little later.

05:56.325 --> 05:58.816
Michelle? God. Just make it quick.

06:19.581 --> 06:21.742
- Hi.
- What the hell are you doing here?

06:21.817 --> 06:24.445
I told you I never
wanted to see you again.

06:24.519 --> 06:26.612
I just want to talk. Just
come out here and let's talk.

06:26.688 --> 06:28.349
I can't believe you came to my house.

06:28.423 --> 06:30.448
- You have no respect for women.
- I don't, I'm sorry.

06:30.525 --> 06:32.789
You hurt my feelings,
you piece of shit.

06:32.861 --> 06:35.227
- Okay. Okay.
- I can't believe you're here.

06:35.430 --> 06:36.988
Okay? Okay?

06:37.065 --> 06:38.760
Mikey! Okay, I'm gonna go.

06:38.834 --> 06:40.734
Joey, come out here!

06:40.802 --> 06:43.498
- Mikey! Joey! Come out here!
- Mikey? Joey?

06:43.605 --> 06:45.766
Go! Get in the car!
Get in the car!

06:47.275 --> 06:48.674
Go, go, go!

06:54.883 --> 06:56.145
Oh, shit!

07:00.355 --> 07:01.720
It's not funny.

07:13.769 --> 07:15.828
- Meeting Michelle.
- Yeah.

07:16.138 --> 07:18.436
What are you
going to see, Beaches?

07:18.507 --> 07:19.838
You're the wind beneath my wings, Mo.

07:19.908 --> 07:22.274
Hey, did you ever know you were my hero?

07:22.744 --> 07:24.439
- Have fun.
- All right, man.

07:28.350 --> 07:29.442
Dave.

07:32.888 --> 07:33.877
Randall.

07:33.955 --> 07:35.115
No, no, I remember your name.

07:35.190 --> 07:36.350
How you doing? Hi.

07:36.425 --> 07:38.325
- What's going on?
- Nothing much.

07:40.829 --> 07:44.287
This is my friend Katherine
and this is my friend Rafi.

07:46.168 --> 07:47.430
- Hi.
- Hi.

07:48.837 --> 07:50.270
So what are you doing here?

07:50.338 --> 07:52.932
Well, I thought I'd see a movie. Right.

07:53.008 --> 07:55.169
Why? Are you embarrassed
to be seen with me?

07:55.243 --> 07:56.904
- What?
- It's okay. Just tell me.

07:56.978 --> 07:59.208
My God, this kid is funny.
Where did you get him?

07:59.281 --> 08:04.048
Well, he works at Travelart
and we had that client...

08:04.119 --> 08:05.177
Hey.

08:05.253 --> 08:06.345
Hey.

08:07.756 --> 08:09.087
- Randall.
- I'm sorry.

08:09.157 --> 08:10.488
- Hi. Michelle.
- Michelle.

08:10.559 --> 08:12.584
- You have your tickets yet?
- No, we're gonna get tickets.

08:12.661 --> 08:13.753
- Are you seeing this?
- Yeah.

08:13.829 --> 08:14.853
- You are?
- Yeah.

08:14.930 --> 08:16.056
That's great. We're...

08:16.131 --> 08:19.259
- I'll see you in there.
- Okay, good. We'll be in...

08:20.669 --> 08:21.931
Get in the bun.

08:22.804 --> 08:24.499
Get in the bun.

08:40.856 --> 08:42.255
It's locked.

08:44.759 --> 08:45.748
What?

08:46.294 --> 08:48.285
The door.
It won't open.

08:51.933 --> 08:53.423
So, does this happen to you a lot?

08:55.437 --> 08:57.234
Actually, not often enough.

08:59.908 --> 09:01.603
So what are we gonna do?

09:02.711 --> 09:05.043
Wait till somebody comes out.

09:07.282 --> 09:08.442
Right.

09:31.339 --> 09:32.636
Thank you. Yeah.

09:35.410 --> 09:37.139
So, how long have you guys been dating?

09:37.212 --> 09:39.112
- Couple of weeks.
- We're not dating.

09:39.181 --> 09:41.547
Okay. Next question.

09:41.616 --> 09:43.982
I mean, we only went
out twice before this.

09:44.052 --> 09:46.577
- Do you consider that dating?
- I guess I did.

09:46.655 --> 09:47.849
I'm sorry.

09:49.558 --> 09:51.423
I mean, to me,
dating sounds more serious.

09:51.493 --> 09:54.223
Like you've already been going
out for a couple of months, like...

09:54.296 --> 09:55.661
Maybe you don't live together...

09:55.730 --> 09:57.857
but you definitely stay over
a couple of nights a week.

09:57.933 --> 09:59.924
You don't worry about who
paid for the last meal anymore.

10:00.001 --> 10:02.401
You've seen each other pee, you know?

10:02.470 --> 10:03.994
More serious kind of stuff.

10:04.072 --> 10:05.869
Then what do you call this?

10:07.409 --> 10:08.433
Well, that's it.

10:08.510 --> 10:11.035
There are officially
no cute boys left here.

10:11.613 --> 10:12.875
All right. It's so nice to get out.

10:12.948 --> 10:15.644
- It was nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, too.

10:18.019 --> 10:20.817
- Dave. Very nice to see you.
- Good night.

10:20.889 --> 10:22.481
Bye. Nice to meet you.

10:37.172 --> 10:39.663
One, two, three, four.

10:48.183 --> 10:49.775
Just fucking call her.

11:01.830 --> 11:02.990
Hello.

11:05.100 --> 11:06.226
Hello?

11:26.521 --> 11:28.648
- Hello?
- Hi. It's Dave...

11:29.357 --> 11:30.449
Bloomberg.

11:31.026 --> 11:32.550
Did you just call me?

11:33.762 --> 11:34.820
Yes.

11:35.630 --> 11:37.120
We get disconnected?

11:38.333 --> 11:39.357
No.

11:40.735 --> 11:42.100
Did you hang up?

11:42.304 --> 11:43.601
Uh-huh.

11:44.472 --> 11:46.337
They say it's better to lie sometimes...

11:46.408 --> 11:48.035
but I can't really do
that when I'm this nervous.

11:48.109 --> 11:50.407
I think I need to be in a better place.

11:50.645 --> 11:53.409
I like it better this way. I've
been around enough lying to say so.

11:53.481 --> 11:55.881
You had a lot of liars
in your life, huh?

11:56.051 --> 11:58.281
- What?
- Shit.

12:00.755 --> 12:04.156
Would you like to go out
to dinner with me tomorrow?

12:04.859 --> 12:08.056
David, I'm making
a sandwich. Do you want one?

12:08.196 --> 12:09.720
No, I'm fine!

12:10.031 --> 12:12.431
- Who's that?
- That's my roommates.

12:12.500 --> 12:14.434
So, do you want to have dinner?

12:17.205 --> 12:18.866
- Yes.
- Yeah?

12:19.574 --> 12:21.667
I'll call you tomorrow.

12:22.544 --> 12:23.602
Okay.

12:25.213 --> 12:26.305
Okay.

12:28.216 --> 12:29.547
- Bye.
- Bye.

12:36.591 --> 12:38.081
Okay, Grandma.

12:39.561 --> 12:42.257
So, what kind of sandwich
are we talking about?

12:55.877 --> 12:58.778
Hi, I'm here to see Rafi
Gardet. My name's Dave.

13:06.521 --> 13:08.421
Raphael. It's Damien.

13:09.357 --> 13:11.086
Yeah. There's a...

13:11.292 --> 13:12.452
It's Dave.

13:12.527 --> 13:14.358
Dave here to see you.

13:17.999 --> 13:19.125
Okay.

13:19.601 --> 13:21.125
She'll be right down.

13:34.048 --> 13:36.107
Bubbles here, I like that.

13:37.919 --> 13:39.318
It's a good touch.

13:42.524 --> 13:45.982
Is that wool?
Looks itchy. Is it itchy?

14:13.288 --> 14:16.189
I think it's the biggest
contradiction in the world.

14:16.257 --> 14:18.316
Jews eat carp, okay?

14:18.393 --> 14:20.725
Who eats carp? They don't
serve it in restaurants.

14:20.795 --> 14:22.888
Have you ever seen carp
on a menu in your life?

14:22.964 --> 14:24.864
Please, answer me honestly.

14:25.600 --> 14:27.727
- No.
- No. You know why?

14:28.002 --> 14:29.697
Because it's disgusting.

14:29.904 --> 14:31.303
But for all this terrible food...

14:31.372 --> 14:33.806
you've never seen a people so
obsessed with it in your life.

14:33.875 --> 14:36.105
It's a remnant. I'll bet
every immigrant group...

14:36.177 --> 14:39.271
that was displaced by World War
II puts a lot of emphasis on food.

14:39.347 --> 14:40.712
I mean, it was scarce.

14:40.782 --> 14:44.081
Carp is cheap, right? It was
probably a staple of their diet.

14:44.152 --> 14:47.087
What is this, the History Channel?
You trying to kill this for me?

14:47.155 --> 14:49.749
Come on. Sorry. Fine, go ahead.

14:50.458 --> 14:52.289
Okay, so my friend Morris...

15:07.942 --> 15:09.705
So I think you're gonna love
this place. It's beautiful.

15:09.777 --> 15:11.142
No one's ever there.

15:11.212 --> 15:13.510
- Can I see some ID?
- Sure.

15:14.916 --> 15:16.747
- Love when that happens.
- Yeah.

15:16.851 --> 15:18.648
I wish I still got carded.

15:22.490 --> 15:23.821
- Excuse me, Dave.
- Yes.

15:23.892 --> 15:26.224
Quick question for you.
How old are you?

15:26.961 --> 15:29.657
Actually, I don't speak
Vietnamese. Why do you ask?

15:29.731 --> 15:32.359
- Are you being evasive?
- I am trying.

15:32.800 --> 15:35.098
You know, I don't tell my age.

15:35.169 --> 15:37.569
I think people get way too
caught up with the number.

15:37.639 --> 15:39.368
I'm 37.
Did you know that?

15:39.774 --> 15:41.173
You know, I hadn't
really thought about it.

15:41.242 --> 15:42.334
Sure you hadn't.

15:42.410 --> 15:44.105
Look, I know you're
a lot younger than me.

15:44.178 --> 15:46.646
I'd just like to know,
you know, how much.

15:47.582 --> 15:49.049
Okay, let me guess.

15:50.919 --> 15:52.784
- Twenty-nine.
- No.

15:53.421 --> 15:55.389
Really?
Older?

15:55.723 --> 15:58.385
- You don't look 30 to me.
- Thanks.

16:00.662 --> 16:01.959
I'm 23.

16:02.163 --> 16:03.460
No, you're not.

16:04.165 --> 16:06.690
I don't believe you.
Let me see the license.

16:12.674 --> 16:15.268
Oh, my God. You're a child.

16:15.777 --> 16:18.337
Taxi! I have T-shirts older than you.

16:18.413 --> 16:21.314
- They let me drive, okay?
- Yeah, with a parent in the car.

16:21.382 --> 16:23.646
How come you seem so much older to me?

16:24.919 --> 16:27.513
I don't know. I don't
know if I can do this.

16:29.090 --> 16:30.318
Come on.

16:34.929 --> 16:36.954
- Can you hold this?
- Sure.

16:42.837 --> 16:45.465
- Are we gonna get in trouble?
- I hope so.

17:04.325 --> 17:06.224
This place is amazing.

17:07.428 --> 17:09.988
I can't believe I've walked
by this for 15 years...

17:10.064 --> 17:11.964
and I didn't know it was here.

17:30.718 --> 17:31.980
Let's have it.

17:32.854 --> 17:33.980
What?

17:35.890 --> 17:37.221
How did you know?

17:39.360 --> 17:41.555
Okay. His name is David...

17:41.629 --> 17:43.995
and he's really, really nice.

17:44.065 --> 17:45.726
I mean, sweet.

17:46.334 --> 17:48.928
And I met him a few days ago
and he asked me out on a date.

17:49.003 --> 17:51.904
And we went out to dinner...

17:53.408 --> 17:54.670
and we kissed.

17:54.876 --> 17:56.275
I like beer.

17:58.112 --> 18:00.546
- Good.
- I mean, no, I...

18:00.815 --> 18:04.376
I never used to. I had to learn,
'cause nobody in my family drinks.

18:04.452 --> 18:06.977
You're lucky, 'cause
everyone in my family drinks.

18:07.055 --> 18:09.523
No, I mean, my family,
they don't drink anything.

18:09.590 --> 18:11.217
It's like Salt Lake City.

18:11.292 --> 18:15.058
They'll have maybe a sip of wine
every Friday night, on the Sabbath.

18:15.663 --> 18:17.893
That's it, though,
and it's Manischewitz.

18:17.965 --> 18:19.296
I've never had that.

18:19.367 --> 18:20.664
You like High-C?

18:20.735 --> 18:23.067
'Cause my mom, she likes to
keep the wine in the fridge...

18:23.137 --> 18:25.605
and we'll still be drinking
it three months later.

18:25.673 --> 18:28.574
- A good chardonnay can last...
- Yeah. It's red.

18:28.976 --> 18:30.341
That's not good.

18:30.578 --> 18:33.308
- Hey, by the way. Things to avoid.
- Okay.

18:33.414 --> 18:35.712
Beginning sentences with, "My mom."

18:37.118 --> 18:38.278
Right.

18:39.187 --> 18:40.552
I'm all over it.

18:46.961 --> 18:50.021
However old you are, I have to say...

18:50.898 --> 18:54.334
I haven't had this much
fun in a really long time.

18:56.471 --> 18:58.200
I'm glad I met you.

18:59.774 --> 19:00.798
I gotta tell you...

19:00.875 --> 19:04.276
you're making me nervous in a
way I'm not really familiar with.

19:24.899 --> 19:29.268
My God, Lisa, what am I doing?
I only got divorced last week.

19:29.370 --> 19:31.668
Easy, easy. It's okay.

19:31.739 --> 19:35.004
You didn't tattoo his name
on your toochis, did you?

19:37.245 --> 19:39.736
Do you want to save
some of that for later?

19:43.384 --> 19:45.648
What? What is it?

19:47.555 --> 19:48.817
He's...

19:51.692 --> 19:54.559
- He's only 27.
- And?

19:55.163 --> 19:58.394
What do you mean, "and"? I
mean, that's 10 years different.

19:58.566 --> 20:00.295
He could be my brother.

20:00.368 --> 20:03.030
If he were one year younger,
he could be your brother.

20:03.104 --> 20:04.833
Aren't you embarrassed for me?
I mean...

20:04.906 --> 20:08.603
this just smells of "pool
boy at Sandals Resort."

20:12.580 --> 20:15.310
Oh, it's fine. It might
even do you some good...

20:15.383 --> 20:16.907
if you know what I mean.

20:16.984 --> 20:18.952
- Lisa!
- What?

20:20.154 --> 20:23.815
There's nothing to be ashamed of.
You're both at your sexual peak.

20:26.761 --> 20:28.592
- So you approve?
- Yes.

20:28.663 --> 20:31.461
Unequivocally.
Yes, this is good.

20:32.033 --> 20:35.867
But it can't really go anywhere.
You know, I mean, he's...

20:36.537 --> 20:37.799
He's so young.

20:37.872 --> 20:40.272
Yeah, but it's a little early
to be worrying about that.

20:40.341 --> 20:43.970
And besides, you're not looking
to get married next week, right?

20:45.613 --> 20:47.410
Enjoy your life a little bit.

20:48.282 --> 20:49.647
You deserve this.

20:51.586 --> 20:55.078
Twenty-seven.
Hell, I deserve this!

20:57.925 --> 20:59.756
No, she's not Jewish.

21:02.330 --> 21:04.321
Mom, I'm not trying to kill you.

21:05.533 --> 21:08.593
Yes, I want you to be alive
to see your grandchildren.

21:09.003 --> 21:10.994
Your Jewish grandchildren, Mom.

21:11.839 --> 21:14.967
No, I didn't know that you
wanted to be buried in Israel.

21:15.643 --> 21:18.737
Mom, I'm not gonna talk about this
over the phone right now, okay?

21:18.813 --> 21:20.405
I'll see you tomorrow.

21:20.882 --> 21:22.941
I love you, too. Bye.

21:45.473 --> 21:47.402
- Hey, Dave.
- Hi, D.

21:47.475 --> 21:48.874
Where's Mom?

21:48.943 --> 21:51.377
I told you to hang it up, Dinah!

21:54.615 --> 21:56.082
Hey, guys.

21:56.150 --> 21:57.981
You left the bathroom
light on this morning.

21:58.052 --> 22:00.714
Jeff Rosenberg's son
got engaged yesterday.

22:00.955 --> 22:02.752
To a speech therapist.

22:09.263 --> 22:11.128
- Hey, boychik.
- Hi, Dad.

22:16.938 --> 22:19.429
We have to talk about our
last phone conversation.

22:19.507 --> 22:22.101
Mom. It's good to see you, too.

22:22.176 --> 22:24.303
- I'm not kidding around.
- Okay, I can...

22:24.378 --> 22:26.175
I can just tell that this is gonna be...

22:26.247 --> 22:28.238
some sort of disciplinary
action, not a talk.

22:28.316 --> 22:30.876
All right. We'll be sure
to make it a talk, then.

22:30.952 --> 22:33.318
Now can you help your
sister set the table, please?

22:33.387 --> 22:34.479
Sure.

22:34.555 --> 22:36.716
And take the wine out of the fridge.

22:39.093 --> 22:41.220
- Has he called yet?
- The next night.

22:41.295 --> 22:43.855
- Nice.
- I know. I'm not used to this.

22:44.632 --> 22:46.361
Did you guys make a
plan to go out again?

22:46.434 --> 22:47.992
He wanted to have dinner
with me tomorrow night.

22:48.069 --> 22:49.661
But I have a flight
early Sunday morning.

22:49.737 --> 22:51.671
When I told him I had
to go to Paris, he goes:

22:51.739 --> 22:53.229
"That's a bit drastic for a bad date.

22:53.307 --> 22:55.138
"Do you really need
to leave the country?"

22:55.209 --> 22:57.700
- This kid's funny.
- Please don't use that word.

22:57.778 --> 22:59.973
Right, sorry. He's humorous.

23:07.888 --> 23:09.446
- What are you doing?
- Drinking.

23:09.523 --> 23:11.718
- He's having Scotch.
- Mom, I'm 23. It's fine.

23:11.792 --> 23:13.453
What, what, what?

23:13.527 --> 23:17.190
Tomorrow, gonna go to
shul, gonna pray that everybody...

23:17.264 --> 23:18.458
is gonna have a happy...

23:18.532 --> 23:20.591
Dinah, you know, since you
told me about computers...

23:20.668 --> 23:23.466
- Mom, let him finish.
- He's finished.

23:23.938 --> 23:25.633
I've become so...

23:25.706 --> 23:27.071
Then why do you have to do this?

23:27.141 --> 23:30.304
There are so many other women
that you could go out with.

23:31.612 --> 23:33.603
And I've encouraged you to branch out...

23:33.681 --> 23:35.808
in any other way that you
like, but just not this.

23:35.883 --> 23:37.350
Why do you have to do this?

23:37.418 --> 23:38.783
What do you mean, "do this"?

23:38.853 --> 23:41.515
Do what?
Incur the wrath of God?

23:41.589 --> 23:43.580
Why are you getting
yourself into trouble?

23:43.657 --> 23:47.559
I'm not getting married, Mom.
I'm just seeing what's out there.

23:47.962 --> 23:50.658
You make it out like we
live in the Warsaw ghetto.

23:50.731 --> 23:53.791
It's the Upper West Side.
We're strong in numbers here.

23:53.868 --> 23:56.234
So you're still planning
on marrying someone Jewish?

23:56.303 --> 23:58.328
Yes. Sure. Okay?

24:00.174 --> 24:02.904
But then I don't understand why
you need to go down this road.

24:02.977 --> 24:04.911
You may end up getting
hurt for nothing.

24:04.979 --> 24:06.970
Or worse, hurting her.

24:08.282 --> 24:10.807
Don't you value your
culture and your history?

24:10.885 --> 24:12.853
Well, it's not one or the other, Mom.

24:12.920 --> 24:14.581
But if you're smart enough to know...

24:14.655 --> 24:17.351
that it makes sense to marry
someone from the same background...

24:17.425 --> 24:19.256
and it does, any of the
studies will show you that...

24:19.326 --> 24:20.793
as far as the divorce rates go.

24:20.861 --> 24:22.658
Then you should be
smart enough to know...

24:22.730 --> 24:24.698
not to start something
where nothing can come of it.

24:24.765 --> 24:26.790
You're only going to make a mess.

24:27.001 --> 24:28.798
I can't even believe what you're saying.

24:28.869 --> 24:30.461
Do you hear what you're saying?

24:30.538 --> 24:32.233
- What?
- You're a therapist.

24:32.373 --> 24:34.102
You would never tell that to a patient.

24:34.175 --> 24:35.608
Not true, not true.

24:35.676 --> 24:37.837
I encourage my patients
to have relationships...

24:37.912 --> 24:41.245
within their respective
faiths. It's easier.

24:42.383 --> 24:45.716
I encourage them to go to
mosque, or church, or whatever.

24:48.122 --> 24:50.989
I think religion is...

24:54.061 --> 24:55.961
paramount in a person's life.

24:57.198 --> 24:59.723
Okay, well, yes...

25:00.668 --> 25:03.796
but encouraging them is
different from discouraging them.

25:03.938 --> 25:06.270
And I know that you draw the line there.

25:06.340 --> 25:08.570
Would you tell one of your
patients not to date someone...

25:08.642 --> 25:10.166
that they don't think
they're gonna marry...

25:10.244 --> 25:12.371
Oh, quit asking me
what I tell my patients.

25:12.446 --> 25:14.141
They're not my children.

25:16.183 --> 25:17.707
How old is she?

25:19.320 --> 25:21.151
She's 27. What?

25:21.822 --> 25:25.087
She's four years older
than you? Oh, David.

25:25.426 --> 25:28.224
Drop it now. It's only
going to end badly.

25:28.496 --> 25:30.123
Maybe if you met her, you might think...

25:30.197 --> 25:31.994
I'm not going to meet her. Oh, my God.

25:32.066 --> 25:33.192
Are you out of your mind?

25:33.267 --> 25:34.666
Mom, do you...

25:34.969 --> 25:36.834
You sound like an after school special.

25:36.904 --> 25:38.201
Don't do this.

25:39.039 --> 25:40.267
I'm doing it.

25:41.775 --> 25:43.140
On your own then.

25:58.292 --> 25:59.782
Hey, what's up, man?

26:01.495 --> 26:02.621
Cool.

26:04.231 --> 26:06.756
Do you need anything or... No?

26:07.601 --> 26:10.593
- Go on up. She's expecting you.
- Thank you. Give me...

26:11.071 --> 26:13.005
Five? Thumbs up?

26:13.941 --> 26:15.203
Smile? No?

26:15.843 --> 26:17.208
We'll get there.

26:24.118 --> 26:26.109
- Hi.
- Hi.

26:28.822 --> 26:30.016
Come on in.

26:35.763 --> 26:37.697
- Thanks for the soup.
- Yeah.

26:37.765 --> 26:39.699
- It's chicken noodle.
- It's hot.

26:41.802 --> 26:42.894
Wow.

26:43.437 --> 26:45.302
This place is huge.

26:46.106 --> 26:47.767
I'm not even going to ask what you pay.

26:47.841 --> 26:50.241
I don't want to know.
It's Rothko.

26:51.111 --> 26:53.705
I've never seen this one
before. What year is this?

26:53.781 --> 26:55.214
1954.

26:56.250 --> 26:58.980
It's probably my single
favorite piece of art.

26:59.620 --> 27:02.350
Yeah, I love how he never
titled any of his work.

27:03.824 --> 27:06.725
It's beautiful. Luminous.

27:14.034 --> 27:15.262
What is this?

27:16.203 --> 27:17.568
Sentimental Mood.

27:21.242 --> 27:23.642
- You never heard Coltrane before?
- No.

27:24.545 --> 27:26.945
- What, am I in trouble now?
- No.

27:27.615 --> 27:28.946
No, it's just...

27:29.817 --> 27:32.012
He's a pretty famous jazz musician.

27:33.320 --> 27:37.256
Oh. So, is this that Negro music
that everybody's talking about?

27:37.324 --> 27:38.916
'Cause I had no idea.

27:55.009 --> 27:57.102
I have to wake up in five hours.

27:58.145 --> 27:59.669
Do you want me to go?

28:02.016 --> 28:03.608
Take off your sweater.

28:05.886 --> 28:07.410
Wait. Does this involve dancing?

28:07.488 --> 28:09.388
'Cause my corns, they've
been killing me and...

28:09.456 --> 28:11.515
Take it off. It's coming with me.

28:13.627 --> 28:14.924
All right.

28:25.873 --> 28:27.431
I really like her.

28:27.508 --> 28:29.669
She's only been gone two
days, she comes back tomorrow.

28:29.743 --> 28:32.143
I miss her already. I
never felt this before.

28:32.212 --> 28:33.873
It's just 'cause you
haven't slept with her yet.

28:33.947 --> 28:35.744
No, that's definitely not it.

28:35.816 --> 28:38.546
I really like her, man.
I don't know, I mean...

28:39.586 --> 28:41.781
- I think I could love her.
- What?

28:41.855 --> 28:44.119
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

28:46.827 --> 28:47.851
Wait, what was I saying?

28:47.928 --> 28:50.897
I don't know, man. There is
something about this girl...

28:50.964 --> 28:52.625
Like, you know that
feeling that you get...

28:52.700 --> 28:54.258
when you're in a room with someone...

28:54.335 --> 28:55.893
and even though you may not know them...

28:55.969 --> 28:57.163
or understand them completely...

28:57.237 --> 29:00.729
you just know that you're
in the presence of greatness?

29:00.974 --> 29:03.374
- You know?
- Like when you come to my apartment.

29:03.444 --> 29:05.344
And she old, man, she a time-fighter.

29:05.412 --> 29:06.902
She's so fine, bro.

29:07.614 --> 29:08.638
I don't know.

29:08.716 --> 29:10.547
I just feel like it's
gonna end badly, I do.

29:10.617 --> 29:12.482
- You sound like my mother.
- Yeah.

29:12.553 --> 29:15.420
- Hey, Morris!
- All right!

29:17.324 --> 29:19.417
What the hell am I listening to you for?

29:19.493 --> 29:21.427
I'm in a bakery shopping for a pie...

29:21.495 --> 29:22.985
so you can put it in some girl's face...

29:23.063 --> 29:24.758
who wouldn't let you get down her pants.

29:24.832 --> 29:26.299
- When was the cream pie made?
- Today.

29:26.367 --> 29:27.356
- Today?
- Yeah.

29:27.434 --> 29:29.527
- Nice. I'll take that one.
- Awesome.

29:31.672 --> 29:33.162
So what's with Dave?

29:33.941 --> 29:35.966
Is he really serious
about this girl, or what?

29:36.043 --> 29:37.169
I don't know.

29:37.244 --> 29:38.973
So what is she?
Catholic? Episcopalian?

29:39.046 --> 29:40.513
I didn't ask.

29:40.681 --> 29:42.945
Would you prefer one
denomination over another...

29:43.016 --> 29:45.109
as far as the love of Christ goes?

29:47.054 --> 29:49.022
- Your father's gonna flip.
- Yeah.

29:49.356 --> 29:51.847
And it's too bad your
mom isn't around for this.

29:51.925 --> 29:54.985
It would have gone over
real big with her, too.

29:57.398 --> 29:59.389
So, what are we gonna do?

30:01.368 --> 30:02.858
I don't know.

30:21.622 --> 30:24.182
Have you ever had ikura with quail egg?

30:24.258 --> 30:26.089
No. What is that?

30:26.593 --> 30:28.493
I swear it's like having sex.

30:29.263 --> 30:31.754
- That's a bold claim.
- You want to try it?

30:32.332 --> 30:34.061
How am I gonna say no now?

30:41.008 --> 30:42.999
- That's amazing.
- I know.

30:45.379 --> 30:46.505
What?

30:57.124 --> 30:58.716
So, how was your trip?

30:58.992 --> 31:01.085
- Who cares?
- Okay.

31:37.297 --> 31:39.629
Well, this sounds really good.

31:40.534 --> 31:42.399
That's what I'm hearing.

31:42.870 --> 31:44.428
It was amazing.

31:44.705 --> 31:47.435
He's really very sweet.

31:50.410 --> 31:52.401
I didn't have an orgasm, though.

31:52.746 --> 31:54.145
Completely normal.

31:55.182 --> 31:57.673
There are so many trust issues there.

31:57.751 --> 31:59.514
You just have to give it time.

31:59.586 --> 32:01.679
I'm willing to do the work.

32:01.755 --> 32:03.188
God damn it.

32:05.626 --> 32:07.617
Do you still worry about his age?

32:07.694 --> 32:08.922
Definitely.

32:08.996 --> 32:11.590
I mean, I was thinking last
night, there are some countries...

32:11.665 --> 32:14.463
where I could get arrested
for this. I mean, 23?

32:15.135 --> 32:17.433
I thought you said he was 27.

32:18.705 --> 32:19.933
Did I?

32:21.508 --> 32:22.668
I did.

32:24.111 --> 32:25.442
I'm sorry.

32:26.880 --> 32:28.643
I lied to you about that.

32:28.715 --> 32:30.478
Why do you think you lied?

32:30.551 --> 32:31.779
I was...

32:32.052 --> 32:34.316
I mean, I am embarrassed by his age.

32:34.388 --> 32:36.253
I mean, he's just so young.

32:38.292 --> 32:39.657
What does he do?

32:40.093 --> 32:41.390
He's an artist.

32:41.562 --> 32:42.654
I'm not an artist.

32:42.729 --> 32:44.162
I thought you said you were a painter.

32:44.231 --> 32:46.495
No. I said I like to paint.

32:46.567 --> 32:50.059
But it's a hobby. I mean,
you have to work, too.

32:50.404 --> 32:53.305
He doesn't call himself
that, but that's what he is.

32:54.174 --> 32:56.301
He has some issue with it.

32:57.511 --> 33:00.344
His family doesn't support
him in his work at all.

33:01.615 --> 33:02.707
Hmm.

33:04.651 --> 33:06.118
Where does he live?

33:06.486 --> 33:09.080
Grand Street.
Lower East Side.

33:09.156 --> 33:10.384
I haven't been there yet.

33:10.457 --> 33:13.426
He has roommates, and so
I'm not exactly running over.

33:18.065 --> 33:19.191
Okay.

33:20.200 --> 33:21.633
Our time is up.

33:21.702 --> 33:24.466
And I will see you on...

33:26.106 --> 33:27.437
On Monday.

33:27.608 --> 33:28.939
Of course.

33:30.544 --> 33:31.772
Are you okay?

33:32.312 --> 33:34.177
Yes. No.

33:34.281 --> 33:37.910
Yes. I mean, I'm fine,
because I have to be somewhere.

33:38.785 --> 33:41.117
- Okay. Bye.
- Bye.

33:50.964 --> 33:52.727
Shit, shit, shit...

33:52.799 --> 33:56.895
shit, shit, shit, shit.

34:22.829 --> 34:24.091
Oh, shit.

34:24.731 --> 34:27.859
So what the hell am I supposed
to do now, end treatment?

34:28.235 --> 34:29.600
Keep going?

34:30.469 --> 34:33.098
Bring them in for a couples session?

34:34.007 --> 34:36.168
Well, if this doesn't go anywhere...

34:36.243 --> 34:38.677
And I really don't think it will.

34:38.945 --> 34:41.675
Then you'll be relieved
you stayed with her now.

34:41.915 --> 34:43.815
If you end her treatment...

34:43.884 --> 34:46.580
and they break up after two weeks...

34:46.786 --> 34:49.312
you will not have served
her best interests.

34:50.389 --> 34:53.484
So what are you saying? That
I should keep treating her?

34:53.560 --> 34:55.322
If you think it's just a fling, yes.

34:55.395 --> 34:58.592
But that sounds crazy.
Is that even ethical?

34:59.199 --> 35:00.894
Your job is to help her.

35:01.835 --> 35:03.735
That's your ethical boundary.

35:07.708 --> 35:08.834
Okay.

35:08.975 --> 35:13.469
Forgetting all the professional
implications of the moment...

35:14.147 --> 35:15.637
how are you feeling?

35:18.585 --> 35:20.018
I'm a wreck.

35:21.855 --> 35:23.516
I'm a wreck.

35:25.826 --> 35:28.454
Rita, she's not even Jewish.

35:30.897 --> 35:32.762
If she were Jewish...

35:33.166 --> 35:37.626
would you feel better about him
dating a 37-year-old divorcee?

35:46.246 --> 35:47.975
Where are we going?

35:48.181 --> 35:50.741
I just gotta stop
by work for a second.

35:51.252 --> 35:53.012
- What's up, Gil?
- Hey, what's up, Dave?

35:53.086 --> 35:54.485
- How you doing, man?
- All right.

35:54.554 --> 35:56.215
- Did you set it up?
- Oh, yeah.

35:56.289 --> 35:57.347
- This is Rafi.
- Hi.

35:57.424 --> 35:58.550
- Pleasure.
- Gil.

36:13.607 --> 36:16.599
Oh, my God.
This is amazing.

36:17.778 --> 36:20.303
Come here. Something
else I want to show you.

36:27.821 --> 36:29.618
You've gotta be kidding me.

37:25.245 --> 37:26.769
Go, go, go!

37:27.747 --> 37:29.476
Quit ignoring me!

37:30.016 --> 37:31.540
Come on, Dave, I'm open.

37:34.187 --> 37:35.552
Get it in there!

37:47.467 --> 37:49.958
- Foul, man! Foul!
- Stay off me. Stay off me.

37:50.036 --> 37:52.004
I've told you twice
now. You've been warned.

38:04.985 --> 38:05.974
Hi.

38:22.836 --> 38:25.100
It's incredible.
It's amazing.

38:25.739 --> 38:29.175
I'm sorry, your bra is showing.
Is it missing a button there?

38:30.076 --> 38:32.544
No. No. That's the way it is.

38:33.880 --> 38:36.280
You were so right about Jewish men.

38:36.650 --> 38:38.174
I mean, so attentive.

38:38.551 --> 38:41.384
But, I mean, of course you
know. You're married to one.

38:41.454 --> 38:43.513
Yes, but he has ADD.

38:43.690 --> 38:46.056
I just can't get over it. I mean...

38:47.060 --> 38:49.460
I feel a little awkward
telling you this.

38:50.664 --> 38:53.189
But I can't tell anyone
else. This is so...

38:54.034 --> 38:58.801
We have had sex on every
surface of my apartment.

39:00.240 --> 39:02.003
I mean, I haven't had much sleep.

39:02.075 --> 39:04.942
But he's just so eager to please me...

39:05.011 --> 39:07.309
and I feel the same way about him.

39:08.181 --> 39:10.206
He makes me want to do things...

39:10.483 --> 39:13.008
I understand. ...that I've never...

39:13.353 --> 39:15.480
wanted to do before. I got it.

39:16.890 --> 39:18.152
You're gonna laugh...

39:18.224 --> 39:21.193
but he didn't actually
know where the clitoris was.

39:22.362 --> 39:23.386
Really?

39:26.466 --> 39:28.229
- Did you show him?
- Of course.

39:28.301 --> 39:30.462
I mean, he's so uninhibited.

39:30.770 --> 39:32.567
Just happy to learn.

39:32.872 --> 39:35.773
He hasn't had much experience.
He's only been with two other women.

39:35.842 --> 39:38.333
What? He's had sex with two other women?

39:38.411 --> 39:40.606
Yes. Can you believe that's it?

39:40.680 --> 39:43.843
Now I know why men go
after younger women.

39:44.284 --> 39:45.979
There's something to it.

39:46.219 --> 39:49.120
His youth, his body...

39:49.189 --> 39:51.316
his naivete...

39:51.391 --> 39:54.451
his goddamn eagerness. I mean...

39:56.129 --> 39:57.460
Isn't this great?

39:57.530 --> 39:59.794
Yeah. It's amazing.

40:00.734 --> 40:01.928
Listen.

40:02.969 --> 40:07.065
I just have to say this because I'm
too embarrassed to tell anyone else.

40:08.608 --> 40:09.973
His penis...

40:11.344 --> 40:13.574
is so beautiful, I just...

40:14.681 --> 40:16.273
want to knit it a hat.

40:19.586 --> 40:21.918
Did you ever think...

40:23.056 --> 40:24.956
that I would be this satisfied?

40:25.392 --> 40:27.883
I mean, sexually.

40:28.395 --> 40:30.056
Not like this.

40:31.831 --> 40:33.662
Are you using protection?

40:34.067 --> 40:36.900
Oh, of course. He brought
it up. He's very responsible.

40:36.970 --> 40:38.665
Oh, that's very good.

40:38.738 --> 40:40.729
Is he neat? What?

40:40.874 --> 40:44.366
Does he pick up after himself?
Does he make the bed in the morning?

40:44.444 --> 40:46.674
Does he ask before he uses the phone?

40:47.113 --> 40:48.774
Yes. Why?

40:49.949 --> 40:53.680
Well, you can tell a lot
about a man from those things.

40:55.288 --> 40:56.414
Yeah, he's very neat.

40:56.489 --> 40:58.582
I mean, he does have some
unusual habits, though.

40:59.159 --> 41:01.184
Hey, I'm not trying to
freak you out here...

41:01.294 --> 41:03.489
but these Q-Tips are amazing.

41:04.564 --> 41:07.965
Guess what? You're freaking me
out. What are you talking about?

41:08.435 --> 41:10.096
We never had these growing up.

41:10.170 --> 41:13.230
I saw them in my Mom's
bathroom, but we never used them.

41:16.609 --> 41:18.008
How'd you clean your ears?

41:18.078 --> 41:21.605
Didn't. Just towel-dried them, I guess.

41:23.016 --> 41:25.007
- Let me see the Q-Tip.
- No.

41:26.419 --> 41:28.216
You have to get out of here.

41:30.323 --> 41:34.089
What kind of mother doesn't teach
their child how to clean their ears?

41:34.227 --> 41:35.592
Pediatricians say...

41:35.662 --> 41:37.994
that it is unhealthy for
children to use them...

41:38.064 --> 41:39.929
because it can damage the eardrum.

41:39.999 --> 41:42.832
And it has been shown that
a small amount of wax...

41:42.902 --> 41:45.700
in the inner canal helps
protect against larger debris.

41:49.375 --> 41:51.172
- I didn't know that.
- Well...

41:52.245 --> 41:53.405
Sorry.

41:58.485 --> 41:59.645
I'm sorry.

42:01.754 --> 42:03.153
Tell me what...

42:03.590 --> 42:05.785
what it is that you're trying to say.

42:08.027 --> 42:10.723
I'm just worried about
where this is going.

42:11.865 --> 42:15.301
You know, I want to give all
of myself. Just let it go.

42:15.368 --> 42:16.699
It's so tempting.

42:17.170 --> 42:19.035
I mean, it's all he wants from me.

42:19.105 --> 42:23.041
Who wouldn't want all of you,
Rafi? You are an amazing woman.

42:23.376 --> 42:24.866
But then I think...

42:25.011 --> 42:28.947
I mean, he's just too young to
handle the responsibility. I...

42:30.350 --> 42:32.614
I'm scared to put myself out like that.

42:33.720 --> 42:37.156
That's a very mature line of thought.

42:38.525 --> 42:41.187
I'm sure his intentions are pure...

42:41.494 --> 42:44.691
but he doesn't sound like...

42:44.898 --> 42:48.356
he knows exactly what
it is he's getting into.

42:50.970 --> 42:53.666
Do you think I should
just cut it off right now?

42:57.177 --> 43:01.341
I'm not going to answer that.

43:05.885 --> 43:07.477
Look, I don't want you to get...

43:07.554 --> 43:09.488
the wrong idea about my family.

43:10.590 --> 43:13.024
Sensitive subject? Huh!

43:15.128 --> 43:16.288
Maybe.

43:17.230 --> 43:18.561
All right, look.

43:19.766 --> 43:22.667
I've been having trouble
with my mom concerning you.

43:23.136 --> 43:24.763
- Concerning me?
- Yeah.

43:25.605 --> 43:29.632
It's just... I wanted her
to meet you and she said no.

43:30.577 --> 43:32.738
That's sweet, but don't you think...

43:32.812 --> 43:35.872
it's a little early to be
introducing me to your mother?

43:42.722 --> 43:45.316
- She said no? Why?
- I...

43:46.726 --> 43:49.957
Look, she has a problem
with you not being Jewish.

43:51.097 --> 43:52.962
- She won't meet me?
- No.

43:53.032 --> 43:56.024
Why do you think I'm so upset?
We're not even speaking right now.

43:56.102 --> 43:58.866
Well, I don't understand. I thought
you said she was a therapist.

43:58.938 --> 44:01.133
I know. How do you think I feel?

44:02.141 --> 44:04.006
Didn't she meet the
black girl you dated?

44:04.077 --> 44:05.237
No way.

44:05.311 --> 44:07.074
No, my mother doesn't
even know about that.

44:07.146 --> 44:09.080
That was my bubi. My dad's mom.

44:13.553 --> 44:15.885
- David, love.
- Hey, bubi.

44:16.456 --> 44:18.947
I wanted you to meet
my girlfriend, Radjina.

44:19.025 --> 44:20.754
Radjina, this is my bubi.

44:21.261 --> 44:22.558
Hi.

44:31.804 --> 44:33.135
Is she black?

44:38.077 --> 44:40.102
It's really not that funny, okay?

44:40.546 --> 44:42.480
My bubi died three weeks later.

44:42.782 --> 44:44.750
And I know she didn't tell
anybody about Radjina...

44:44.817 --> 44:46.546
but her reaction and
her subsequent death...

44:46.619 --> 44:48.917
let me know it might be a good
idea to keep that one quiet.

44:48.988 --> 44:51.081
I swear, I think she went
in the house after that...

44:51.157 --> 44:53.318
and just hit herself over
the head with the frying pan.

44:53.393 --> 44:55.884
I mean, that's the image I get
whenever I'm doing something wrong.

44:55.962 --> 44:58.863
Just her, like, whacking
away with the skillet.

45:01.434 --> 45:03.163
I can say this much.

45:03.703 --> 45:05.136
Age aside...

45:06.072 --> 45:09.132
he gives me more of
what I really need...

45:09.208 --> 45:11.506
than anyone else ever has.

45:13.579 --> 45:14.978
Real things.

45:15.848 --> 45:17.281
Things I never got.

45:18.651 --> 45:20.619
It makes it hard to harp on age...

45:20.687 --> 45:22.985
or religion or anything, because...

45:26.759 --> 45:28.317
I'm just happy.

45:33.199 --> 45:34.291
Yeah.

45:47.814 --> 45:49.304
What's wrong, David?

45:50.083 --> 45:52.415
- I lost my job.
- I'm sorry.

45:52.885 --> 45:55.752
Did you hear Josh Friedman
got engaged to a chef?

45:55.822 --> 45:59.053
Yes, I heard. Truffle
matzo balls. Amazing.

46:00.059 --> 46:01.890
You better tell him
about the Kushners, Sam.

46:01.961 --> 46:05.328
We're trading apartments with
the Kushners, starting August 1st.

46:05.398 --> 46:06.660
In Miami?

46:07.066 --> 46:09.864
You have to find someplace
else to live while we're gone.

46:09.936 --> 46:12.905
Oh, come on. Not now. This
is the worst possible time.

46:13.239 --> 46:15.332
And who goes to Miami in August?

46:15.408 --> 46:16.568
That's what I said.

46:16.642 --> 46:17.904
Come on. What are you talking about?

46:17.977 --> 46:19.376
It's beautiful this time of year.

46:19.445 --> 46:23.347
Grandpa, it's a sauna down there
and it rains every single afternoon.

46:23.416 --> 46:25.350
The Kushners are taking you for a ride.

46:25.418 --> 46:27.477
- I told you, Sam.
- Oh, what does he know?

46:27.553 --> 46:29.544
It's a condominium.
We're going.

46:29.622 --> 46:32.352
What? Condominium means no rain?

46:51.611 --> 46:53.772
Do you know where Raphael Gardet is?

46:56.115 --> 46:58.413
My dad's got this
great place in Wainscott.

46:58.484 --> 47:01.783
There's a limo waiting, so you
won't have to take the Jitney.

47:02.488 --> 47:05.116
Excuse me. Do you know
where Raphael Gardet is?

47:05.925 --> 47:08.257
- Who are you?
- I'm Dave.

47:08.761 --> 47:10.126
Hi, Dave.

47:11.063 --> 47:12.792
Are you one of the models?

47:14.100 --> 47:15.590
No. Are you the hairdresser?

47:15.668 --> 47:17.727
- Excuse me?
- I think you heard me.

47:18.438 --> 47:19.837
Diana, eyes to me.

47:20.406 --> 47:21.634
That's great.

47:24.076 --> 47:25.771
Are you the hairdresser?

47:28.147 --> 47:30.877
That was good.
I really enjoyed that.

47:34.754 --> 47:37.222
I just asked him
simply, "Do you know where...

47:37.290 --> 47:40.020
"Raphael Gardet is?" And he gives
me all this attitude like I'm some...

47:40.092 --> 47:42.424
Whatever.
Jesus, Dave. It's so uncool.

47:42.495 --> 47:44.292
- The guy's a schmuck.
- Schmuck?

47:44.363 --> 47:46.126
It's who I work for.

47:46.199 --> 47:49.168
Who are you?
What are you thinking?

47:50.136 --> 47:51.967
I got cut to one day a week at work.

47:52.038 --> 47:54.029
Then I find out I gotta be
out of my place on Monday.

47:54.106 --> 47:56.006
I'm gonna be broke in a month.

47:57.810 --> 47:59.675
But I'm sorry, okay?

48:00.580 --> 48:01.774
I am sorry.

48:08.187 --> 48:10.519
Okay, let's do something.
It's Friday night.

48:10.590 --> 48:13.218
What do you want to do? Start
observing the Sabbath or something?

48:13.292 --> 48:14.281
No.

48:16.195 --> 48:18.720
I wanna know what a normal
Friday night was like for you...

48:18.798 --> 48:20.197
before you met me.

48:20.366 --> 48:22.698
I mean, you didn't sit around
fireplaces in The Village...

48:22.768 --> 48:24.463
drinking merlot, did you?

48:24.871 --> 48:26.864
Actually, we stood
around trash-can fires

48:26.964 --> 48:28.864
in the Bowery drinking 40s.

48:33.145 --> 48:34.669
- Come on.
- What?

48:35.548 --> 48:38.210
I wanna know what you did. Show me.

48:38.985 --> 48:40.646
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

49:14.754 --> 49:17.314
Let's go to your place.
We never go to your place.

49:17.390 --> 49:19.722
I got roommates, Rafi. Rafi...

49:21.260 --> 49:23.023
I wanna see your paintings.

49:24.564 --> 49:26.122
You're not missing much.

49:26.399 --> 49:28.264
Convenient and weak.

49:30.303 --> 49:32.294
I wanna go, I wanna go right now.

49:32.371 --> 49:35.340
I want to see where you sleep
when you're not in my bed.

50:00.032 --> 50:01.499
This is nice.

50:10.076 --> 50:11.065
Kitchen.

50:11.143 --> 50:12.872
- Very grown-up.
- Yeah.

50:23.689 --> 50:25.247
- David?
- Yeah.

50:25.558 --> 50:26.991
Who are your roommates?

50:27.259 --> 50:28.954
Is that you, David?

50:30.863 --> 50:33.093
Yes. Go to sleep, Grandma.

50:37.603 --> 50:40.572
Come on. Give me a break. It's
embarrassing enough, all right?

50:41.941 --> 50:44.569
- Where's the bathroom?
- Bathroom's right there.

50:45.578 --> 50:49.173
- Did you eat?
- Yes, I ate. Good night.

51:06.932 --> 51:08.263
What are you doing?

51:09.035 --> 51:10.593
Stashing all your pornos?

51:10.670 --> 51:13.503
Yeah, and all my posters
had to come down, too.

51:23.182 --> 51:26.208
- Why are they all facing away?
- I don't know.

51:27.119 --> 51:29.110
Who wants to look at
my paintings all day?

51:31.557 --> 51:33.115
We have to talk...

51:33.759 --> 51:36.728
about this thing you have with your art.

51:36.796 --> 51:38.161
I mean, it's weird.

51:39.165 --> 51:41.656
It's like you think
it's a sin or something.

51:44.036 --> 51:45.094
Bubi?

51:46.338 --> 51:48.135
I've decided I'm gonna be an artist.

52:12.865 --> 52:13.991
Dave.

52:15.201 --> 52:16.634
You're really good.

52:17.002 --> 52:20.233
This is what you should be doing.
You've got to keep painting.

52:22.141 --> 52:23.233
Yeah?

52:24.777 --> 52:26.142
It's not a life.

52:26.212 --> 52:28.840
Says who? You're crazy.

52:52.805 --> 52:55.899
You're lucky. I'm just
paving the way for you.

52:57.710 --> 52:59.678
This is the curse of the eldest child.

53:00.246 --> 53:02.942
When it's all over you'll
be able to bring home Jay-Z.

53:03.015 --> 53:05.449
Are you and Mom talking? Not really.

53:06.318 --> 53:08.445
She's just a different
person these days.

53:10.122 --> 53:12.682
- What are you doing?
- I'm just dropping off some clothes.

53:12.958 --> 53:14.653
You're not going to stay here?

53:15.427 --> 53:16.894
I'm going to Morris' place.

53:17.129 --> 53:19.654
To tell you the truth, I didn't
even think you'd want me here.

53:19.732 --> 53:21.097
Don't be melodramatic.

53:21.233 --> 53:23.098
This is your home.
We're your family.

53:23.969 --> 53:25.903
Even if you did bring home Jay-D.

53:26.238 --> 53:27.466
It's Jay-Z, Mom.

53:28.641 --> 53:32.407
Whatever.
Jay-B, Jay-D...

53:33.345 --> 53:35.905
I have a patient coming, so
be careful when you leave.

53:58.404 --> 54:02.602
Oh, I'm so sorry to keep you waiting.

54:02.675 --> 54:04.609
Did I knock?
Am I late?

54:08.080 --> 54:09.308
I feel like I'm late.

54:09.949 --> 54:11.439
But no. No.

54:11.984 --> 54:13.508
Sit, sit, sit.

54:15.387 --> 54:17.378
What is that? A gun?

54:17.456 --> 54:19.117
No, it's a yoga mat.

54:25.631 --> 54:27.462
- He's moving in with me.
- What?

54:30.870 --> 54:33.202
I thought you said...
Weren't you just saying...

54:33.272 --> 54:36.173
that he couldn't provide you
with the things that you needed?

54:36.242 --> 54:37.709
I'm still unsure.

54:37.776 --> 54:39.767
But I think I should
just give it a shot.

54:40.312 --> 54:42.906
I mean, you always say,
"Just get messy in life.

54:42.982 --> 54:45.075
"At least you know
you're living." Right?

54:45.985 --> 54:48.215
Besides, if he can't
give me what I need...

54:48.287 --> 54:50.585
then I'll find out sooner
if he's living with me.

54:51.957 --> 54:54.357
- And he has nowhere to go.
- He said that?

54:55.361 --> 54:56.953
His best friend has a studio.

54:57.029 --> 55:00.123
He's not getting along with
his mother, so he can't go home.

55:00.933 --> 55:03.163
She hates me, by the
way. Did I tell you that?

55:03.402 --> 55:05.563
No. You hadn't mentioned it.

55:05.638 --> 55:09.497
Yes, it's this whole other thing...that
I'm trying not to even think about.

55:10.342 --> 55:12.105
They say the children
of psychoanalysts...

55:12.177 --> 55:13.542
are the most screwed up of all.

55:14.113 --> 55:15.603
Yes, I had heard that.

55:16.515 --> 55:18.710
So he's moving in.

55:19.184 --> 55:20.481
I think it'll be fun.

55:20.552 --> 55:22.383
That's what you said
to do with this, right?

55:22.454 --> 55:24.422
I mean, just have fun.

55:24.924 --> 55:26.983
That's right. That's right.

55:27.092 --> 55:28.491
What are you looking at?

55:28.560 --> 55:31.028
I... I forgot, I have a book...

55:31.363 --> 55:35.094
A book... A book I wanted to show you.

55:35.167 --> 55:36.498
Thought it might be...

55:36.568 --> 55:38.729
"Lesbians and the Kabbalah...

55:38.804 --> 55:40.396
"A Match Made in Heaven."

55:40.940 --> 55:43.670
Wrong book. Wrong book. Wrong...

55:43.742 --> 55:46.006
Oh, my.
Oh, well, never mind.

55:49.982 --> 55:52.212
Forget it. I'm sorry.

56:00.225 --> 56:03.160
I am so late.

56:03.529 --> 56:05.156
I can't help it if you parade around...

56:05.230 --> 56:07.721
fulfilling every working-girl
fantasy I've ever had.

56:08.467 --> 56:11.300
You should wear a garbage bag
till you get to the elevator.

56:14.173 --> 56:15.902
Hey, are we still going
to the Hamptons Friday?

56:15.975 --> 56:17.602
Yeah. See you.

57:02.187 --> 57:04.348
Great. Village People weekend.

57:04.957 --> 57:06.117
You'll be fine.

57:06.191 --> 57:07.715
I've been grooming you for this moment.

57:07.793 --> 57:12.253
A Bette Davis marathon on the Turner
Classic Network hardly qualifies.

57:12.331 --> 57:14.799
Hey, you guys, they're here.
Come on.

57:18.003 --> 57:21.029
- Hi. How are you?
- Hey, Jason.

57:22.875 --> 57:24.604
- You look great.
- You do, too.

57:24.810 --> 57:26.300
- Dave, this is Jason.
- Hi.

57:26.378 --> 57:27.845
Hi. We've heard all about you.

57:27.913 --> 57:29.437
Hi.  Raphael!

57:30.315 --> 57:32.374
- Hello.
- Hello.

57:33.886 --> 57:35.513
It's so good to see you again.

57:35.854 --> 57:36.946
- How are you?
- I'm good.

57:37.022 --> 57:38.319
- How was the drive?
- It was good.

57:38.390 --> 57:39.379
Good. Brilliant.

57:39.458 --> 57:41.449
- Palmer, this is Dave.
- Hi.

57:41.527 --> 57:43.859
- How are you?
- Great. How are you doing?

57:43.929 --> 57:45.226
- Great.
- Yeah?

57:45.297 --> 57:46.286
Is he okay? Or...

57:46.365 --> 57:49.823
Ignore him. He's just jealous he
didn't get into your pants first.

57:51.904 --> 57:54.065
Hey, what's up?

57:54.173 --> 57:56.801
Oh, my God! I am so sorry.

57:56.875 --> 57:59.002
Alsayste, you junkie!

57:59.078 --> 58:00.670
It's so he won't bark. Are you okay?

58:00.746 --> 58:02.008
Yeah. I think I'm blind.

58:02.081 --> 58:04.276
Oh, no. Gotta call the pediatrician.

58:04.349 --> 58:05.680
All right, come on.

58:07.920 --> 58:10.320
- That stings.
-  That's terrible.

58:12.357 --> 58:14.257
This place is amazing.

58:15.127 --> 58:18.654
I mean, everything.
Every room is perfect.

58:19.832 --> 58:23.029
Look at this.
Even the beds are awesome.

58:25.838 --> 58:27.999
We're gonna have vacation sex tonight.

58:28.073 --> 58:30.132
What's vacation sex, Dave?

58:30.576 --> 58:32.737
I don't know, but you're
gonna get it, girl.

58:35.147 --> 58:37.547
Look at this, even the
breeze coming through here.

58:37.616 --> 58:38.776
This is perfect.

58:39.985 --> 58:41.418
Is it like this for all rich people?

58:41.487 --> 58:43.478
No, just gay rich people.

58:44.256 --> 58:45.814
- You're gonna get it.
- Oh, yeah?

58:46.225 --> 58:47.624
I'm gonna give it to you.

58:51.763 --> 58:53.458
Vacation sex, Dave?

58:58.537 --> 59:00.095
Please. You are the only...

59:00.172 --> 59:01.696
registered gay Republican in New York.

59:01.773 --> 59:03.138
It's just a tax thing.

59:03.208 --> 59:04.937
I'm to the left on every other issue.

59:05.010 --> 59:08.241
I still say the Democrats need their
own show pushing their own agenda.

59:08.313 --> 59:10.372
No one would watch. I
mean, there's no blood.

59:10.449 --> 59:11.939
I'd watch that show.

59:12.017 --> 59:14.884
People would much rather
watch some liberal be humiliated...

59:14.953 --> 59:16.318
on The O'Reilly Factor.

59:17.723 --> 59:19.088
You should go on, Jason...

59:19.158 --> 59:20.386
and thoroughly humiliate the man.

59:20.459 --> 59:22.086
Sure, he'd love me.

59:22.161 --> 59:24.721
- Alsayste? Where is he?
- I'll get him.

59:30.335 --> 59:34.533
- Fiddler on a hot tin roof.
- And so young. Have you carded him?

59:34.606 --> 59:37.006
Yes, unfortunately, I have.

59:37.075 --> 59:40.135
I think he's great. Smart and
sweet. Just needs a little seasoning.

59:40.212 --> 59:41.201
I think he's...

59:41.280 --> 59:43.805
You don't get to say. You're
totally infatuated with him.

59:43.916 --> 59:46.248
Maybe, but I'm still worried about you.

59:46.318 --> 59:49.310
He is so young and you're
obviously falling for him.

59:49.388 --> 59:51.820
- So what? Fall.
- What is wrong with you?

59:51.823 --> 59:54.257
You look 10 years younger.
I've never seen you this happy.

59:54.326 --> 59:55.987
I'm just saying, you want a baby...

59:56.061 --> 59:57.858
and he is in no position
to give you that.

59:57.930 --> 01:00:00.694
- You're on the clock, Rafi.
- Thanks, Randall. That's sweet.

01:00:00.766 --> 01:00:03.360
Plus, he has this weird
relationship with his mother...

01:00:03.435 --> 01:00:06.563
who wants him to marry someone
named Rivkah or Devorah.

01:00:06.638 --> 01:00:07.696
Randall, who asked you?

01:00:07.773 --> 01:00:09.001
Besides, I think it's interesting...

01:00:09.074 --> 01:00:10.541
that you call their
relationship weird...

01:00:10.609 --> 01:00:12.600
when all it is, is close.

01:00:12.711 --> 01:00:14.372
We should all be so lucky.

01:00:14.780 --> 01:00:17.874
Besides, your mother still thinks
you're straight, for Christ's sakes.

01:00:20.919 --> 01:00:23.615
So, Dave, do you
care if your kids are Jewish?

01:00:27.259 --> 01:00:28.692
I care if they're happy.

01:00:29.561 --> 01:00:30.687
Good answer.

01:00:32.831 --> 01:00:34.492
So, what's up with your friends?

01:00:34.566 --> 01:00:36.659
This whole weekend felt
like a long audition.

01:00:36.735 --> 01:00:39.260
- They're just worried about me.
- Worried about what?

01:00:39.338 --> 01:00:40.862
How old you are, I mean...

01:00:41.540 --> 01:00:43.633
my wanting to have a
child at some point.

01:00:43.709 --> 01:00:45.336
Your moving in.

01:00:45.811 --> 01:00:47.802
And I'm just a little
nervous, that's all.

01:00:48.347 --> 01:00:51.544
You know how it is in New York.
Your apartment's all you have.

01:00:52.017 --> 01:00:54.850
A few hundred square feet
you can call your own.

01:01:05.430 --> 01:01:07.898
The work's strong, I mean,
it's realistic portraits...

01:01:07.966 --> 01:01:10.059
and he's only 23, I was amazed.

01:01:10.135 --> 01:01:13.434
Sounds great. I'd really like
to take a look at his work.

01:01:14.006 --> 01:01:16.270
- Is he here?
- Yes, he is.

01:01:16.341 --> 01:01:17.638
- Great.
- He'd love that.

01:01:17.709 --> 01:01:18.801
- Let me go find him.
- Okay.

01:01:22.681 --> 01:01:24.046
I want you to see this.
Come here.

01:01:25.217 --> 01:01:26.343
Raphael.

01:01:27.286 --> 01:01:28.719
- How are you, honey?
- How you doing?

01:01:28.787 --> 01:01:29.981
- Good to see you.
- Nice to see you.

01:01:30.055 --> 01:01:31.454
Have you met my friend Ann?

01:01:31.523 --> 01:01:32.581
Hi.

01:01:32.658 --> 01:01:34.023
Nice to meet you.
I've got my hands full.

01:01:34.092 --> 01:01:37.823
- You sure do. Gosh, she's beautiful.
- Thank you.

01:01:38.397 --> 01:01:40.058
- What's her name?
- Ella.

01:01:41.166 --> 01:01:42.997
You're so sweet.

01:01:43.835 --> 01:01:45.666
- How old is she?
- She's one.

01:01:45.737 --> 01:01:48.262
- Oh, my goodness.
- Yeah, she's a big girl.

01:01:48.340 --> 01:01:49.773
Do you have any children?

01:01:49.841 --> 01:01:51.536
No, I don't have any children.

01:01:53.345 --> 01:01:56.610
She's just started walking.
She's holding onto the railing...

01:01:58.417 --> 01:02:00.214
Oh, she's so sweet.

01:02:12.898 --> 01:02:14.024
Hey, baby.

01:02:14.900 --> 01:02:15.889
Hey.

01:02:17.202 --> 01:02:20.000
Do you know you have
over 500 channels on this thing?

01:02:20.072 --> 01:02:22.165
I watched the Malaysian
Grand Prix today.

01:02:22.240 --> 01:02:24.708
Really? That's amazing.

01:02:27.045 --> 01:02:29.275
Have you left the apartment
since this morning?

01:02:31.950 --> 01:02:33.941
No. Why?

01:02:35.454 --> 01:02:37.581
He sits around
all day in my apartment.

01:02:37.656 --> 01:02:39.783
I have zero privacy when I go home.

01:02:39.858 --> 01:02:42.224
This does not sound good. He
needs to get his own place.

01:02:42.294 --> 01:02:44.353
Yeah, but he needs a job first.

01:02:44.429 --> 01:02:45.589
It's about time.

01:02:45.664 --> 01:02:47.825
I need to buy him a
birthday present this week.

01:02:47.899 --> 01:02:49.127
Do you have any ideas?

01:02:49.201 --> 01:02:52.068
There's this Nintendo thing he
keeps on talking about and...

01:02:52.637 --> 01:02:54.161
Rafi, let me ask you something.

01:02:55.273 --> 01:02:56.535
Do you like having sex?

01:03:01.513 --> 01:03:02.741
Don't get Nintendo.

01:03:08.954 --> 01:03:10.080
Are you coming to bed?

01:03:11.056 --> 01:03:12.523
Yeah, right after this game.

01:03:22.367 --> 01:03:23.891
Just for a sec.

01:03:24.035 --> 01:03:25.297
- Okay.
- What can it hurt?

01:03:25.370 --> 01:03:28.032
- I've got to get back.
- We'll just look, all right?

01:03:33.879 --> 01:03:36.814
- How much is this?
- Much too much. Don't look.

01:03:36.882 --> 01:03:38.315
Don't even look.

01:04:02.374 --> 01:04:04.239
- May I help you?
- What?

01:04:04.910 --> 01:04:06.207
- May I...
- No.

01:04:34.239 --> 01:04:35.672
- Jack.
- What?

01:04:35.740 --> 01:04:37.002
- We have to go.
- Why?

01:04:37.075 --> 01:04:38.565
I have an appointment I forgot about.

01:04:38.643 --> 01:04:41.339
- I thought you said you didn't...
- I just have to go, all right?

01:04:41.413 --> 01:04:42.710
- Why?
- Oh shit!

01:04:42.781 --> 01:04:44.408
- Get down, get down.
- Why?

01:04:49.120 --> 01:04:51.486
- It's a patient?
- No, it's my lover.

01:04:51.556 --> 01:04:53.581
Yes, it's a patient.
Just be quiet.

01:05:04.736 --> 01:05:07.864
- You're gonna have to explain this.
- You know I can't.

01:05:10.108 --> 01:05:12.542
Okay. You're scaring
some of the customers.

01:05:21.753 --> 01:05:23.380
Just dropped a contact.

01:05:30.295 --> 01:05:32.354
I was married to a
man who couldn't love me.

01:05:33.198 --> 01:05:35.359
And now I'm with someone
who can love me...

01:05:36.368 --> 01:05:39.531
but he's not really a man.
At least, not all the time.

01:05:40.405 --> 01:05:41.872
I can see that.

01:05:41.940 --> 01:05:46.206
Maybe if I give myself
to him completely...

01:05:46.845 --> 01:05:48.972
he'll step up in the ways I need him to.

01:05:49.314 --> 01:05:51.646
He said he knows I'm not
giving all of myself...

01:05:51.716 --> 01:05:53.115
and it's unfair to us.

01:05:55.921 --> 01:05:58.981
I don't think I can do this anymore.

01:06:00.125 --> 01:06:01.456
I'm sorry.

01:06:02.661 --> 01:06:04.390
I just can't.

01:06:04.663 --> 01:06:05.891
Do what?

01:06:12.737 --> 01:06:14.671
We need to talk, Rafi.

01:06:17.342 --> 01:06:18.434
Okay.

01:06:18.877 --> 01:06:20.310
He's my son.

01:06:21.546 --> 01:06:22.604
Who?

01:06:50.375 --> 01:06:52.866
Why does it say Lisa
Metzger on your door?

01:06:53.478 --> 01:06:55.503
Metzger is my maiden name.

01:06:59.417 --> 01:07:00.884
You betrayed me.

01:07:03.254 --> 01:07:04.346
Yes.

01:07:05.323 --> 01:07:07.086
I did betray your trust...

01:07:07.158 --> 01:07:10.491
but I did it to preserve
our relationship.

01:07:10.562 --> 01:07:12.621
That seemed more important to me.

01:07:13.965 --> 01:07:16.456
Is this what you call
preserving our relationship?

01:07:17.469 --> 01:07:21.166
It seemed at the time
like the right thing to do.

01:07:21.806 --> 01:07:24.604
What do you mean, at the
time? How long have you known?

01:07:26.611 --> 01:07:28.340
Five weeks, four days.

01:07:28.713 --> 01:07:31.705
I wanted to make sure that
it wasn't just a fling.

01:07:31.783 --> 01:07:35.514
If it was, then we would have
been able to continue, but...

01:07:36.021 --> 01:07:37.921
Now we're having a conversation...

01:07:37.989 --> 01:07:41.015
that will very likely
end our work together.

01:07:41.626 --> 01:07:42.854
Can you see...

01:07:42.927 --> 01:07:46.124
that I wanted to avoid
having this conversation...

01:07:47.866 --> 01:07:49.493
for your benefit?

01:07:49.634 --> 01:07:52.865
No. I think you did it to
control your son's life.

01:07:52.937 --> 01:07:55.235
No. That's not true. That is not true.

01:07:55.640 --> 01:07:58.700
I stayed in it just for
you, no other reason.

01:07:59.010 --> 01:08:00.272
I don't believe you.

01:08:01.046 --> 01:08:03.640
That you could give me
advice to do as I please...

01:08:04.749 --> 01:08:07.309
and then not do the same
for your son is wrong.

01:08:08.653 --> 01:08:10.484
I think you need to look at that.

01:08:10.822 --> 01:08:14.553
Thank you. I am working on that
with my therapist right now.

01:08:16.995 --> 01:08:20.055
You let me talk to you about his penis.

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:25.902
Trust me, that was harder
for me than it was for you.

01:08:27.671 --> 01:08:30.903
Up until a few weeks ago, I didn't
even think my son had a penis.

01:08:34.511 --> 01:08:39.073
Do you realize your mother now knows
intimate details about your penis?

01:08:40.417 --> 01:08:41.885
You told her about my penis?

01:08:43.388 --> 01:08:44.582
Jesus, Rafi.

01:08:44.656 --> 01:08:45.884
Excuse me...

01:08:45.957 --> 01:08:48.517
I thought it was safe to assume
it wouldn't get back to her.

01:08:49.027 --> 01:08:51.461
She better not use that to
get me home for Thanksgiving.

01:08:52.564 --> 01:08:55.533
- How can you make jokes?
- What else am I gonna do?

01:08:55.600 --> 01:08:58.261
Get angry! Be outraged!

01:08:58.336 --> 01:09:00.429
I am, okay? I am angry.

01:09:00.505 --> 01:09:02.200
I can't believe she took it this far.

01:09:02.273 --> 01:09:05.242
I'm just... I know that she
cares about the people she helps.

01:09:05.310 --> 01:09:07.243
- And she cares a lot.
- What is wrong with you?

01:09:07.312 --> 01:09:09.576
- I have to draw the line there.
- You're delusional.

01:09:09.647 --> 01:09:11.671
She's just trying to
control you. She still is.

01:09:11.750 --> 01:09:13.308
Rafi, I'm not arguing with you.

01:09:13.384 --> 01:09:16.353
I know she tries to
control me. I hate it. I do.

01:09:17.188 --> 01:09:18.176
But...

01:09:18.923 --> 01:09:21.357
All I'm saying is, she would
never use you to do that.

01:09:21.426 --> 01:09:23.451
You are so naive.

01:09:24.696 --> 01:09:27.721
How could you deceive her like
that? That was totally unethical!

01:09:27.966 --> 01:09:32.062
How dare you? I care far more
about her well-being than you do.

01:09:32.136 --> 01:09:35.732
That's evident by your choice
in continuing to see her.

01:09:35.807 --> 01:09:36.865
Mom.

01:09:37.408 --> 01:09:38.705
What are you going to do now?

01:09:39.577 --> 01:09:40.635
Live a life.

01:09:40.712 --> 01:09:42.509
I hope you're making
the right decisions...

01:09:42.580 --> 01:09:44.707
because you've got somebody
else counting on you now.

01:09:44.783 --> 01:09:47.081
That's fine. I can
handle it. I love her.

01:09:47.152 --> 01:09:50.019
Great. Just don't come to me,
help you clean up the mess.

01:09:50.087 --> 01:09:51.214
I won't.

01:09:51.288 --> 01:09:54.122
I mean, there won't be
a mess to clean up, Mom.

01:09:54.459 --> 01:09:56.689
And I didn't buy you Q-Tips...

01:09:56.928 --> 01:09:59.396
because I was trying
to protect your ears.

01:10:10.508 --> 01:10:12.476
So what? She's just gonna
let you live there rent-free?

01:10:12.544 --> 01:10:14.671
No, it ain't free. I'm
paying in other ways.

01:10:14.746 --> 01:10:16.213
Oh, my God, you're my hero.

01:10:16.281 --> 01:10:17.839
No, it's not like that.

01:10:17.916 --> 01:10:19.941
This whole thing with my
mother has just killed her.

01:10:20.018 --> 01:10:22.452
She's, like, impossible
to live with these days.

01:10:22.921 --> 01:10:25.287
This is it.
You wanna wait outside or...

01:10:25.356 --> 01:10:27.756
No, I thought I'd stand next
to you with some paper towels.

01:10:27.826 --> 01:10:29.054
I'll meet you back at Rafi's.

01:10:29.127 --> 01:10:30.219
I want you to check out her place.

01:10:30.295 --> 01:10:32.422
She's not going to be
back for a couple of hours.

01:10:32.497 --> 01:10:34.727
Can't believe you
haven't made Page Six yet.

01:10:37.902 --> 01:10:39.927
- You know what? This place is sick.
- I know.

01:10:40.004 --> 01:10:42.029
Now I understand why
you're taking all her shit.

01:10:42.106 --> 01:10:43.403
That's not why.

01:10:43.908 --> 01:10:47.173
I mean, I like living here, but
that's not the reason I'm with her.

01:10:48.947 --> 01:10:52.815
Great apartment, friends with houses
in the Hamptons, art connections.

01:10:52.884 --> 01:10:54.681
Those are good reasons.
You know what I mean?

01:10:54.752 --> 01:10:55.980
- Shut up.
- What?

01:10:56.054 --> 01:10:58.716
Come on, man, she's got you
tied up like it's Pelican Bay.

01:10:59.991 --> 01:11:02.084
Seriously, I barely
even see you anymore.

01:11:02.293 --> 01:11:05.091
You even said it. I'm only here
right now because she's not home.

01:11:11.636 --> 01:11:12.830
Shit.

01:11:12.904 --> 01:11:15.372
It's her. Come on.
You've got to hide.

01:11:15.440 --> 01:11:17.271
Are you serious? I really can't be here?

01:11:17.342 --> 01:11:19.037
Yeah. No. Get in the
closet. In the closet?

01:11:19.110 --> 01:11:21.578
Get in the closet. She doesn't
like people in her living space.

01:11:21.646 --> 01:11:23.273
Living space? What the
hell's living space?

01:11:23.348 --> 01:11:25.282
Is the kitchen part of
it? Just get in the closet.

01:11:25.350 --> 01:11:26.339
Jesus Christ.

01:11:33.191 --> 01:11:34.180
What's up?

01:11:36.761 --> 01:11:38.592
What are you doing home already?

01:11:38.997 --> 01:11:41.192
Oh, I'm sorry. Would
you like me to leave?

01:11:42.567 --> 01:11:44.831
I thought you were hanging
out with Morris today.

01:11:45.103 --> 01:11:48.004
Oh, yeah, drink that.
That's good stuff, huh?

01:11:48.072 --> 01:11:49.801
I was. I mean, I am.

01:11:50.308 --> 01:11:51.468
I mean, hanging out...

01:11:51.542 --> 01:11:53.169
What's wrong with you?
You're acting weird.

01:11:53.244 --> 01:11:55.610
Me? No, I'm fine.
You okay?

01:11:58.816 --> 01:12:01.717
Is there someone here? What? No.

01:12:03.288 --> 01:12:05.313
Oh, my God, is there
someone here with you?

01:12:12.830 --> 01:12:13.990
I'm allergic to...

01:12:14.065 --> 01:12:15.965
- What is going on here?
- Okay, okay...

01:12:16.901 --> 01:12:18.459
All right, look.

01:12:18.836 --> 01:12:21.361
We were only here for a few
minutes. Then I heard you coming...

01:12:21.439 --> 01:12:23.669
and I panicked, and I told him to hide.

01:12:23.942 --> 01:12:25.967
- In the closet?
- I told him it was a bad idea.

01:12:26.044 --> 01:12:27.875
Rafi, we were only here just...

01:12:27.946 --> 01:12:31.404
Long enough to have a beer with
your pie-throwing, sociopath friend?

01:12:31.482 --> 01:12:34.849
Wait. Hey, hey. No.
Wait. I told him...

01:12:35.386 --> 01:12:37.183
I told you not to come
up, but you forced me.

01:12:37.255 --> 01:12:38.415
No, you did not.  You lie...

01:12:38.489 --> 01:12:39.888
Wait, wait, wait.

01:12:39.958 --> 01:12:41.949
Is that better or
worse than a psychopath?

01:12:42.026 --> 01:12:43.789
What is wrong with you?

01:12:44.028 --> 01:12:46.019
I can't believe I have
to come home to this.

01:12:46.097 --> 01:12:48.565
People hiding in the
closet, you're lying.

01:12:48.633 --> 01:12:50.601
You're a goddamn preschooler, Dave!

01:12:50.668 --> 01:12:52.863
You've had me on lockdown since
the minute I moved in here.

01:12:52.937 --> 01:12:53.926
- What?
- Yeah.

01:12:54.005 --> 01:12:56.838
You tell me you want me here and
then you treat me like an inmate.

01:12:56.908 --> 01:13:00.071
An inmate? I mean, you barely
carry your weight around here, Dave.

01:13:00.144 --> 01:13:03.011
I do everything and you
can't even clean up the place.

01:13:03.348 --> 01:13:04.781
The one thing I ask of you...

01:13:04.849 --> 01:13:07.283
is that you would tell me
when you bring someone here.

01:13:07.352 --> 01:13:09.718
Rafi, this is not such a big deal, okay?

01:13:09.787 --> 01:13:11.118
You need to get over it.

01:13:11.189 --> 01:13:13.555
I'm not Francis.

01:13:13.624 --> 01:13:16.286
I'm not lying to you.
I'm not cheating on you.

01:13:16.361 --> 01:13:18.226
- I'm definitely not avoiding you.
- Thanks.

01:13:18.296 --> 01:13:21.231
That's reassuring and in
really, really good taste.

01:13:24.302 --> 01:13:25.826
You know what? I...

01:13:26.804 --> 01:13:28.066
I can't do this anymore.

01:13:28.139 --> 01:13:29.902
You should get a dog if
you wanna give orders...

01:13:29.974 --> 01:13:32.135
'cause I really don't
give a shit anymore!

01:13:33.478 --> 01:13:34.467
Let's go.

01:13:52.964 --> 01:13:54.522
I missed you like crazy.

01:14:00.605 --> 01:14:03.904
I think we need to take a break,
Dave, and start seeing other people.

01:14:06.444 --> 01:14:07.536
What?

01:14:10.715 --> 01:14:14.116
I can't do this. This
just isn't right for me...

01:14:15.553 --> 01:14:17.453
and I can't trust you anymore.

01:14:17.922 --> 01:14:20.186
I was only showing him your
place for a minute. I just...

01:14:20.258 --> 01:14:21.589
It's not just that.

01:14:26.097 --> 01:14:29.260
You're in no place to
give me what I need.

01:14:30.635 --> 01:14:31.863
I get that.

01:14:32.136 --> 01:14:34.127
And then this whole
thing with your mother...

01:14:34.205 --> 01:14:35.763
I don't even know
what to say about that.

01:14:35.840 --> 01:14:37.034
It's crazy.

01:14:38.409 --> 01:14:40.468
But just think the reason
she stopped seeing you...

01:14:40.545 --> 01:14:42.809
is because she believes
that we're in love.

01:14:49.353 --> 01:14:50.843
It's just...

01:14:52.190 --> 01:14:54.658
It's just not gonna work
out. At least, not now.

01:14:57.061 --> 01:14:58.494
So that's it?

01:15:04.602 --> 01:15:05.694
Rafi.

01:15:19.984 --> 01:15:21.975
You don't look as
relieved as you predicted.

01:15:23.287 --> 01:15:25.915
Are you kidding?
I'm devastated.

01:15:27.225 --> 01:15:31.594
I hurt my patient so that she could
have a relationship with my son.

01:15:32.196 --> 01:15:33.527
And so what happens?

01:15:34.098 --> 01:15:35.588
My son hurts my patient.

01:15:36.901 --> 01:15:38.266
And now...

01:15:38.703 --> 01:15:41.501
my patient hurts my son.

01:15:44.976 --> 01:15:47.706
I'm totally confused
about my part in this.

01:15:47.778 --> 01:15:50.406
I think you did the right thing, Lisa.

01:15:50.948 --> 01:15:52.813
You know, even love won't guarantee...

01:15:52.884 --> 01:15:55.079
that they're not going
to hurt one another.

01:15:55.153 --> 01:15:57.951
If anything, it just
makes it a likelihood.

01:16:12.170 --> 01:16:13.603
Thanks for coming down.

01:16:14.038 --> 01:16:16.063
Sorry the place is such a mess.

01:16:16.140 --> 01:16:19.667
Rafi thought I'd like your
work and I trust her judgment.

01:16:20.044 --> 01:16:21.636
Yeah, well, we broke up.

01:16:23.047 --> 01:16:25.038
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

01:16:25.583 --> 01:16:28.450
- She didn't say anything about it?
- No.

01:16:39.430 --> 01:16:40.658
These are great.

01:16:40.932 --> 01:16:42.866
- Do you have a gallery?
- No.

01:16:43.834 --> 01:16:45.324
How much for the larger pieces?

01:16:46.470 --> 01:16:48.165
I don't know. I never sold one before.

01:16:48.573 --> 01:16:50.734
I'll give you $1,000 each for these two.

01:16:50.875 --> 01:16:52.934
And I'll see what I can do
about getting you a show.

01:16:56.214 --> 01:16:57.306
Done.

01:16:59.483 --> 01:17:00.507
I don't believe it.

01:17:00.585 --> 01:17:03.452
You're gonna be a huge painter
and I get to go along for the ride.

01:17:05.856 --> 01:17:08.416
Maybe I can write this whole
pie thing off as performance art.

01:17:08.492 --> 01:17:09.823
What do you think?

01:17:10.628 --> 01:17:11.788
- Who you calling?
- Rafi.

01:17:11.862 --> 01:17:13.523
- Why?
- I want to tell her how it went.

01:17:13.598 --> 01:17:15.964
Plus I want to kick her a few
bucks for the time I spent there.

01:17:16.033 --> 01:17:17.864
- She'll appreciate it.
- What am I, chopped liver?

01:17:17.935 --> 01:17:20.267
I'm gonna pretend you didn't
say that. You're the reason...

01:17:20.338 --> 01:17:22.238
- All right, all right.
-  I'm not in right now.

01:17:22.306 --> 01:17:24.035
Does this mean you're gonna
get your own place now?

01:17:24.108 --> 01:17:25.370
- Shut up.
- Thanks.

01:17:26.544 --> 01:17:28.978
Hey, Raff, it's me again. Listen...

01:17:29.180 --> 01:17:31.614
I have some amazing news
for you. Please pick up.

01:17:32.650 --> 01:17:34.311
Rafi, Rafi.

01:17:34.919 --> 01:17:36.079
Hello?

01:18:13.424 --> 01:18:15.187
Why don't you call him, then?

01:18:33.377 --> 01:18:36.938
I like it, man. It's very
The Early Years, you know?

01:18:37.648 --> 01:18:39.843
A little roach problem,
but you can fix that.

01:18:40.718 --> 01:18:43.152
It's gonna look good when A&E
comes to shoot the documentary.

01:18:43.220 --> 01:18:44.380
He lived on rugalach and macaroons...

01:18:44.455 --> 01:18:46.184
for the first four years
during his Blue Period...

01:18:46.257 --> 01:18:47.315
Would you shut up?

01:18:47.391 --> 01:18:48.415
...and then moved on to the Louvre.

01:18:48.492 --> 01:18:50.892
All right, Howard Hughes. Tell
me to shut up again. Get dressed.

01:18:50.961 --> 01:18:52.087
Let's go. Let's get it moving around.

01:18:52.163 --> 01:18:53.687
I wanna go out. I want you to look nice.

01:18:53.764 --> 01:18:55.698
You've been shut in too
long. Let's go. Pick it up.

01:19:05.543 --> 01:19:07.010
- We're with her.
- No, you're not.

01:19:07.078 --> 01:19:09.012
What? Come on, man, that's
my girlfriend right there.

01:19:09.080 --> 01:19:10.104
Back off the rope.

01:19:14.218 --> 01:19:15.207
Hey.

01:19:19.290 --> 01:19:21.155
Hold the goddamn mayo.
You know that chick?

01:19:21.225 --> 01:19:22.283
- Yeah. Don't point.
- Sorry.

01:19:22.360 --> 01:19:23.452
What's wrong?

01:19:24.362 --> 01:19:25.693
We can't get in.

01:19:25.763 --> 01:19:28.664
Hey, it's okay.
Come on. Let them in.

01:19:33.771 --> 01:19:35.363
I love you, okay? I really do.

01:19:35.439 --> 01:19:37.737
But if you don't take
advantage of this situation...

01:19:37.808 --> 01:19:40.038
I'm gonna seriously
question your manhood.

01:19:41.178 --> 01:19:42.543
I miss her.

01:19:42.913 --> 01:19:44.471
Get over it, okay?

01:19:44.548 --> 01:19:45.981
It's been two weeks.

01:19:46.050 --> 01:19:48.177
You don't think she's out
here doing the same thing?

01:19:49.887 --> 01:19:52.219
I'm thinking
the pan-seared trout.

01:19:53.324 --> 01:19:55.485
What about the salmon? Looks good, too.

01:19:56.794 --> 01:19:58.659
Do you think it's wild or farm-raised?

01:20:00.164 --> 01:20:02.632
- Do you like carp?
- No.

01:20:09.173 --> 01:20:10.538
I wanna dance.

01:20:10.875 --> 01:20:12.206
Go get to work, sister.

01:20:12.676 --> 01:20:14.701
Come on, shake it like
a salt shaker. Go ahead.

01:20:23.387 --> 01:20:24.854
What is that?

01:20:25.556 --> 01:20:26.580
What is that? No, no.

01:20:26.657 --> 01:20:29.956
That's like some Irene Cara shit.
She ought to be wearing leg warmers.

01:20:30.227 --> 01:20:31.626
All right, you gotta do damage control.

01:20:31.695 --> 01:20:34.220
- Yeah.
- This is not helping anybody. Go.

01:20:39.703 --> 01:20:41.227
Have a drink, baby.

01:20:48.078 --> 01:20:49.443
Feel better?

01:20:50.281 --> 01:20:51.373
Much.

01:20:53.951 --> 01:20:54.940
Yes!

01:21:06.163 --> 01:21:08.028
I'm going to use your toothbrush.

01:21:08.098 --> 01:21:09.360
That's okay, right?

01:21:10.835 --> 01:21:12.063
Oh, my God.

01:21:12.636 --> 01:21:13.728
What?

01:21:25.316 --> 01:21:26.442
Dave.

01:21:27.184 --> 01:21:29.914
- Yeah.
- Do you believe in Jesus Christ?

01:22:50.067 --> 01:22:51.227
You're painting.

01:22:52.169 --> 01:22:53.500
I'm working.

01:23:00.177 --> 01:23:02.168
I'm not doing this to piss you off, Mom.

01:23:02.246 --> 01:23:04.214
This is not an act of rebellion.

01:23:04.281 --> 01:23:06.181
I love her.
I'm trying to make it work.

01:23:06.250 --> 01:23:07.274
I could really use your help.

01:23:07.351 --> 01:23:10.013
My help. Have you even
heard a word I've said?

01:23:10.087 --> 01:23:11.384
I am out of this.

01:23:12.823 --> 01:23:14.723
Just let me bring her over Friday night.

01:23:14.792 --> 01:23:16.692
Please. Mom, I'm begging you.

01:23:16.961 --> 01:23:18.519
She doesn't stop talking about you.

01:23:18.596 --> 01:23:20.655
How much she misses
you and all this stuff.

01:23:20.731 --> 01:23:22.358
Are you insane?

01:23:23.267 --> 01:23:24.564
There is no way.

01:23:56.967 --> 01:23:58.127
You okay?

01:24:06.677 --> 01:24:08.508
Mom? We're here.

01:24:12.182 --> 01:24:13.513
Rafi.

01:24:20.557 --> 01:24:23.082
What? What is it, sweetie?

01:24:23.727 --> 01:24:25.217
I missed you.

01:24:25.963 --> 01:24:27.692
Now I just realized how much.

01:24:31.635 --> 01:24:33.262
I missed you, too.

01:24:33.771 --> 01:24:35.932
Did you? Yes.

01:24:36.540 --> 01:24:38.906
- Hello, sweetheart.
- Hi, Mom. Thank you.

01:24:40.544 --> 01:24:42.569
- You look very nice.
- Okay.

01:24:43.447 --> 01:24:44.607
Coats.

01:24:46.116 --> 01:24:47.413
What? Oh, yeah.

01:24:48.585 --> 01:24:50.780
- Jack.
- Ma, can Audrey come over?

01:24:50.854 --> 01:24:53.414
No, no, no. Get off the phone.
Would you get off the phone?

01:24:58.529 --> 01:25:00.827
All right, Dad, this is Rafi.

01:25:01.065 --> 01:25:02.327
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:25:02.399 --> 01:25:03.832
Nice to meet you. Very nice to meet you.

01:25:03.901 --> 01:25:05.698
- This is my sister. D.
- Hi. Dinah.

01:25:05.769 --> 01:25:07.396
- Hi.
- I like your dress.

01:25:08.739 --> 01:25:10.331
- I heard so much about you.
- Yeah?

01:25:10.674 --> 01:25:12.904
- Hi, I'm Blanche.
- She's my mother.

01:25:12.976 --> 01:25:14.307
- And you are?
- Rafi.

01:25:14.378 --> 01:25:16.642
- Rafi. What a nice name.
- Thank you.

01:25:16.714 --> 01:25:18.272
It's for Raphael, actually.

01:25:18.849 --> 01:25:20.214
Just like the painter.

01:25:20.784 --> 01:25:23.116
- Painter?
- My husband, Sam.

01:25:23.187 --> 01:25:25.018
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- Hi, Sam. Nice to meet you.

01:25:25.089 --> 01:25:26.181
Watch out for him.

01:25:29.059 --> 01:25:30.185
That's the truth.

01:25:30.260 --> 01:25:32.057
- Hope you're hungry.
- Yeah.

01:25:33.063 --> 01:25:37.193
Oh, my... You shouldn't have.
Thank you.

01:25:37.267 --> 01:25:40.202
Thank you very much.
What a cute bag.

01:25:40.270 --> 01:25:42.500
- It's a nice bottle, too.
- Look at that.

01:25:42.573 --> 01:25:45.474
If it gets cold enough, we
can drink it with dinner.

01:25:45.542 --> 01:25:46.975
- Mom.
- Absolutely.

01:25:47.044 --> 01:25:49.205
Put it in the freezer for 10 minutes.

01:25:49.780 --> 01:25:51.042
It'll be fine.

01:25:54.818 --> 01:25:55.807
Thank you.

01:25:55.886 --> 01:25:58.946
God bless my daughter. I honestly
don't know where I'd be without her.

01:25:59.022 --> 01:26:01.183
In Brooklyn, Sam.
You'd be in Brooklyn.

01:26:02.726 --> 01:26:04.591
This is you next to me.

01:26:05.462 --> 01:26:07.555
- This is beautiful.
- You okay, Grandma?

01:26:07.631 --> 01:26:10.464
- Like I have a choice?
- You're okay till you collapse.

01:26:11.702 --> 01:26:13.602
I have to tell you a wonderful story.

01:26:14.404 --> 01:26:18.307
First time I met my
Blanche.In the subway.

01:26:18.375 --> 01:26:21.435
There used to be an elevated line
that ran across De Kalb Avenue.

01:26:21.512 --> 01:26:22.979
I was on one side of the car...

01:26:23.046 --> 01:26:24.911
she was on the other side of the car.

01:26:24.982 --> 01:26:28.008
And she is wearing the dopiest
hat you ever saw in your life.

01:26:28.085 --> 01:26:29.347
She looked terrific.

01:26:29.419 --> 01:26:31.353
I feel like I've heard
this story once before.

01:26:31.421 --> 01:26:33.048
Only once? You're lucky.

01:26:36.493 --> 01:26:38.620
It's an adorable story.

01:26:39.696 --> 01:26:40.720
I like this.

01:26:40.798 --> 01:26:43.596
How great is it that
David sold his paintings?

01:26:43.667 --> 01:26:46.500
Yes, we're so happy for him.

01:26:46.570 --> 01:26:48.003
- Yeah, right.
- What?

01:26:48.071 --> 01:26:49.868
I never thought you
had a chance in hell.

01:26:49.940 --> 01:26:50.998
There you go.

01:26:51.942 --> 01:26:54.706
- Oh, Dad, really.
- Anyway, you should...

01:26:54.845 --> 01:26:58.106
You should all know that this is what I'm
gonna be doing...for the rest of my life.

01:26:58.515 --> 01:26:59.743
Really?

01:26:59.817 --> 01:27:02.012
No CPA. No law degree.

01:27:02.753 --> 01:27:05.347
No, "Paging Dr.
Bloomberg," Dad. This is it.

01:27:05.422 --> 01:27:07.549
I suppose you can make
a living out of it.

01:27:11.261 --> 01:27:14.697
So, I understand you're interested
in converting to Judaism.

01:27:14.765 --> 01:27:16.960
Oh, my God.

01:27:20.170 --> 01:27:22.138
- Good, thank you.
- Sure.

01:27:24.775 --> 01:27:26.834
- Does this go in here?
- Yes.

01:27:29.513 --> 01:27:31.310
Okay, good. That's good.

01:27:41.592 --> 01:27:45.153
- This is very strange.
- Yes, it is... I would say, yeah.

01:27:45.662 --> 01:27:49.860
Certainly never experienced
anything even remotely like it.

01:27:52.169 --> 01:27:56.606
So now you've seen that even
your therapist has a crazy family.

01:27:58.108 --> 01:28:00.838
Are you kidding? This
is what I never had.

01:28:00.911 --> 01:28:04.506
You know, no grandparents. No
laughter around the dinner table.

01:28:05.115 --> 01:28:06.776
No dinner, actually.

01:28:14.491 --> 01:28:16.425
Thank you for having me over.

01:28:18.295 --> 01:28:20.456
I know this was very difficult for you.

01:28:20.731 --> 01:28:22.665
No, it wasn't difficult at all.

01:28:33.043 --> 01:28:34.635
I think you're great, Rafi.

01:28:35.913 --> 01:28:37.505
I think you're great.

01:28:38.248 --> 01:28:41.684
I know this is hard for you to
understand, but this isn't personal.

01:28:42.252 --> 01:28:47.121
I just don't want my son
giving up on his faith so early.

01:28:47.190 --> 01:28:48.680
But he wouldn't have to.

01:28:48.926 --> 01:28:51.326
I would want my kids to
have a religious upbringing.

01:28:51.395 --> 01:28:54.228
You know I didn't have one. You
always said I suffered from it.

01:28:55.332 --> 01:28:56.959
Slow down. You...

01:28:57.634 --> 01:29:00.159
Kids? With my son?

01:29:01.505 --> 01:29:03.735
Rafi, think about what you're saying.

01:29:03.807 --> 01:29:05.138
I'm sorry.

01:29:06.410 --> 01:29:09.004
Sometimes I forget
that you're his mother.

01:29:10.547 --> 01:29:12.708
I still think of you as my therapist.

01:29:23.527 --> 01:29:24.926
What a mess, huh?

01:29:27.431 --> 01:29:30.594
You know what else? He had, like,
20 boxes of Q-Tips in his bathroom.

01:29:30.667 --> 01:29:33.465
Meanwhile, the rest of the
place is a complete dump.

01:29:34.671 --> 01:29:37.003
Wait a minute. This is
Dave you're talking about?

01:29:37.474 --> 01:29:38.463
Rafi's Dave?

01:29:38.542 --> 01:29:40.237
Yeah? So what?
They're broken up.

01:29:40.377 --> 01:29:43.813
Listen to me, Sue. Rafi and
Dave are back together now.

01:29:45.215 --> 01:29:47.649
Okay, so they're back
together. What's the big deal?

01:29:47.718 --> 01:29:50.186
The big deal is, it would kill her.

01:29:50.253 --> 01:29:52.687
Okay. Jesus, I won't say anything.

01:29:53.690 --> 01:29:55.385
You won't say anything about what?

01:30:05.635 --> 01:30:06.624
Hey.

01:30:14.011 --> 01:30:15.501
Did you sleep with Sue?

01:30:17.481 --> 01:30:18.573
What?

01:30:55.752 --> 01:30:56.776
You know what?

01:30:56.853 --> 01:30:59.287
Just call her already and go
back to your own place, please.

01:30:59.589 --> 01:31:01.750
I need quiet time. Thank you.

01:31:02.192 --> 01:31:04.683
No, I'm not going to
call her. This is crazy.

01:31:04.761 --> 01:31:06.228
She tells me to see other people...

01:31:06.296 --> 01:31:08.355
and then she punishes
me for taking her advice?

01:31:08.432 --> 01:31:09.763
Screw that.

01:31:11.835 --> 01:31:16.295
You know what? Come on, even I can
see that it's not that you went out.

01:31:16.673 --> 01:31:17.935
It's who you went out with.

01:31:19.843 --> 01:31:22.471
It's, like, Learn Your
Fucking Lesson Day around here.

01:31:24.381 --> 01:31:25.814
Jesus Christ.

01:31:36.693 --> 01:31:38.217
Lock the door, please.

01:31:39.262 --> 01:31:40.422
Thank you.

01:31:42.966 --> 01:31:46.060
Magnolia. Traitors.

01:31:48.772 --> 01:31:53.038
You have my total support
in whatever you want to do.

01:31:53.443 --> 01:31:56.310
Then why do I feel
like you're still against this?

01:31:57.114 --> 01:32:01.278
I'm not. I am worried.
I'm your mother.

01:32:01.351 --> 01:32:02.511
That's my job.

01:32:02.752 --> 01:32:04.913
What if I decide to
go through with this?

01:32:04.988 --> 01:32:09.357
Sweetheart, you clearly have
something special, you two.

01:32:09.926 --> 01:32:13.384
I look at this relationship and
I think what it's done for you.

01:32:14.464 --> 01:32:16.227
It's really... It's great.

01:32:17.734 --> 01:32:19.861
You are... I mean,
you've come into your own.

01:32:19.936 --> 01:32:21.665
You're a painter. I get that.

01:32:22.239 --> 01:32:24.264
Rafi made me see that.

01:32:25.642 --> 01:32:27.473
That is going to be your life.

01:32:27.544 --> 01:32:30.342
That's right. That's
right. That's great.

01:32:31.448 --> 01:32:34.781
But, David, you have
to try to hear this.

01:32:35.485 --> 01:32:38.477
Love is not always enough.

01:32:38.989 --> 01:32:41.651
Not when you're talking
about marriage and children...

01:32:41.725 --> 01:32:43.352
and joint checking accounts.

01:32:43.426 --> 01:32:47.385
You're not supposed to learn
this lesson at 23, maybe...

01:32:47.464 --> 01:32:50.956
but you did get yourself
into a complicated situation.

01:32:51.034 --> 01:32:52.058
Mom.

01:32:54.905 --> 01:32:56.998
Relationships are work.

01:32:57.073 --> 01:32:58.472
Children...

01:32:59.509 --> 01:33:00.999
are work.

01:33:01.478 --> 01:33:04.811
And I'm not saying love
isn't important. It is, but...

01:33:06.716 --> 01:33:09.879
- So what are you saying?
- I'm saying that...

01:33:15.358 --> 01:33:18.589
Sometimes you love and you learn.

01:33:19.396 --> 01:33:20.920
And you...

01:33:22.632 --> 01:33:23.894
move on.

01:33:26.303 --> 01:33:27.565
And that's okay.

01:33:55.432 --> 01:33:56.763
Here we go.

01:34:25.795 --> 01:34:26.784
Whoops.

01:34:31.635 --> 01:34:33.000
I'm sorry.

01:34:37.807 --> 01:34:38.865
And?

01:34:39.109 --> 01:34:41.009
And it was a really...

01:34:41.678 --> 01:34:44.374
really bad call and I wasn't thinking.

01:34:44.848 --> 01:34:47.146
I'm so sorry, Rafi. I'm just...

01:34:47.550 --> 01:34:51.543
learning this stuff as I go along,
but you gotta work with me here...

01:34:51.621 --> 01:34:53.020
because...

01:34:54.324 --> 01:34:55.791
Can we get a minute here?

01:34:55.859 --> 01:34:57.383
No way. I work here.

01:34:58.395 --> 01:35:00.192
Fine. I'm going anyway. Look.

01:35:00.864 --> 01:35:04.095
Rafi, we might have some
things working against us...

01:35:04.167 --> 01:35:08.001
and I do screw up from time to
time, but so does everybody else.

01:35:08.805 --> 01:35:10.966
The difference with
me is I am actively...

01:35:11.041 --> 01:35:13.032
I'm trying so hard to get it right.

01:35:13.610 --> 01:35:16.272
And I wanna be the man that
you see in me every so often.

01:35:16.880 --> 01:35:20.077
Okay, on leap years, fine. But
I wanna be that guy for you.

01:35:21.318 --> 01:35:22.945
Bottom line is...

01:35:23.820 --> 01:35:25.685
I love you so much.

01:35:29.693 --> 01:35:31.684
I'll figure it out, okay?

01:35:32.896 --> 01:35:35.888
I'll get it. You just
gotta give me a chance.

01:35:56.853 --> 01:35:59.378
- Are you sure about this?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

01:35:59.456 --> 01:36:00.684
Why now?

01:36:02.192 --> 01:36:04.251
'Cause you want this more
than anything in the world.

01:36:04.761 --> 01:36:06.251
And I wanna give it to you.

01:36:08.164 --> 01:36:09.654
I wanna make a baby with you.

01:36:11.901 --> 01:36:13.129
I can't.

01:36:15.839 --> 01:36:16.897
Why?

01:36:18.742 --> 01:36:21.575
Because I love you and
I can't do this to you.

01:36:21.911 --> 01:36:24.141
I don't understand.
What are you doing to me?

01:36:25.181 --> 01:36:27.081
It actually feels really good.

01:36:30.620 --> 01:36:31.780
I just can't.

01:36:34.491 --> 01:36:35.981
I wanna give this to you.

01:36:41.998 --> 01:36:43.488
I know you do.

01:36:44.134 --> 01:36:46.898
And it's the sweetest gift
anyone's ever given me.

01:36:48.872 --> 01:36:50.362
But it's not right for you.

01:36:51.741 --> 01:36:53.174
You'll regret it.

01:36:54.477 --> 01:36:55.774
You know this.

01:36:57.680 --> 01:36:59.307
The fact that you're still willing...

01:36:59.382 --> 01:37:01.976
just shows how deep your love goes.

01:37:05.889 --> 01:37:08.016
That's the gift I'm taking from you.

01:38:04.581 --> 01:38:06.378
I think I only need to
sell one more painting...

01:38:06.449 --> 01:38:07.916
then I'll have enough
to get out of here.

01:38:07.984 --> 01:38:09.679
What? Where you gonna go?

01:38:10.286 --> 01:38:13.722
I was thinking about somewhere in
Central America. Maybe El Salvador.

01:38:13.957 --> 01:38:16.221
You're just gonna pick
up and go to El Salvador?

01:38:17.193 --> 01:38:18.592
- Yeah.
- I don't understand.

01:38:18.661 --> 01:38:21.528
You get there, you get off the
plane. How do you know where to go?

01:38:21.831 --> 01:38:23.560
I don't. I'm going to figure it out.

01:38:23.633 --> 01:38:25.362
It's time for me to
try something like this.

01:38:25.435 --> 01:38:26.959
I've never even left the country before.

01:38:27.036 --> 01:38:28.867
Excuse me. What about Class Trip '98?

01:38:29.305 --> 01:38:30.897
- What, Niagara Falls?
- Yeah.

01:38:30.974 --> 01:38:32.805
- Come on, Morris.
- What?

01:38:33.643 --> 01:38:36.237
- Well, man, what am I gonna do?
- You should come with me.

01:38:36.312 --> 01:38:38.177
- No. El Salvador?
- Yeah.

01:38:38.248 --> 01:38:40.478
That's Noriega country,
amigo. I'm gonna pass on that.

01:38:40.550 --> 01:38:42.609
No, that's Panama, and
you might learn something.

01:38:42.952 --> 01:38:44.476
I'm learning right here.

01:38:44.554 --> 01:38:46.681
I went on a second date with
this girl the other night.

01:38:46.956 --> 01:38:47.945
You're kidding me.

01:38:48.024 --> 01:38:50.584
Yes, I am. But I had you for
a second, didn't I? I had you.

01:38:50.660 --> 01:38:52.025
- Oh, shit.
- What?

01:38:52.862 --> 01:38:55.160
- I forgot my hat at the restaurant.
- Oh, you schmuck.

01:38:55.498 --> 01:38:57.591
- You want me to come with you?
- No, that's cool, I'll get it.

01:38:57.667 --> 01:38:58.425
All right, man. I love you, brother.

01:38:58.501 --> 01:39:00.200
- I'll catch up with you.
- All right, man.

01:39:18.988 --> 01:39:21.286
- You forgot your hat.
- Yeah.

01:39:25.828 --> 01:39:27.227
- There you go.
- Thank you.
