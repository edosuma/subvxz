WEBVTT

01:11.280 --> 01:13.532
So, I'm here.

01:13.532 --> 01:17.870
- And, I do not see anything happening.
- <i>Right.</i>

01:17.870 --> 01:19.746
- <i>Right.</i>
- At all.

01:19.746 --> 01:20.789
<i>Look, I'm very sorry, sir.</i>

01:20.789 --> 01:23.709
Guess what I'm trying to understand is,
what is the reason for this delay exactly?

01:23.709 --> 01:24.793
<i>Yeah. Mr. Plotkin,</i>

01:24.793 --> 01:26.295
- Specifically.
- <i>I'm so sorry.</i>

01:26.295 --> 01:29.715
- <i>But it's just that when we set out...</i>
- Yeah, we closed in November.

01:29.715 --> 01:31.133
We had all the permit applications in

01:31.133 --> 01:32.634
- before the end of the year.
- <i>Right. Once we get...</i>

01:32.634 --> 01:33.802
<i>...the final stamp of approval.</i>

01:33.802 --> 01:35.345
And we can't get the trucks here
a little early?

01:35.345 --> 01:37.222
- Just, you know, get 'em started.
- <i>Miami Beach ordinances...</i>

01:37.222 --> 01:38.640
- <i>won't let me do that.</i>
- Is anyone actually...

01:38.640 --> 01:40.726
- ...enforcing those regulations?
- <i>Look, Mr. Plotkin,</i>

01:40.726 --> 01:42.352
<i>I know that you're eager to move in. Okay.</i>

01:42.352 --> 01:44.062
- <i>Once we get the final stamp of approval.</i>
- No.

01:44.062 --> 01:45.522
- <i>You're gonna be the first...</i>
- One second.

01:45.522 --> 01:46.648
<i>Sure.</i>

01:47.149 --> 01:48.233
Hello?

01:51.111 --> 01:53.071
You see what's going on at GME?

01:53.071 --> 01:54.698
<i>There's more of these idiots?</i>

01:54.698 --> 01:57.659
<i>...the short sellers, now they're getting
creamed by the little guy.</i>

01:57.659 --> 01:58.827
A lot more.

01:58.827 --> 02:00.370
<i>They won't hold much longer.</i>

02:00.370 --> 02:01.496
Go away.

02:02.372 --> 02:04.833
Oh Gabe, honey, they're holding.

02:05.626 --> 02:07.794
<i>It just crossed a hundred.</i>

02:07.794 --> 02:10.130
<i>Gabe, where are you?</i>

02:10.130 --> 02:11.298
Fuck!

02:11.298 --> 02:13.091
<i>You should probably dial in.</i>

02:13.091 --> 02:14.384
Yeah, be on in one sec.

02:31.527 --> 02:32.986
<i>I will tell you I've never seen
anything like it.</i>

02:32.986 --> 02:34.530
<i>I'm concerned about it.</i>

02:34.530 --> 02:36.490
<i>I'm calling it the ultimate short squeeze.</i>

02:36.490 --> 02:38.784
<i>You can lose money to infinity.</i>

02:38.784 --> 02:42.329
<i>It's very different, more highly leveraged
game on the other side.</i>

02:43.705 --> 02:44.915
Holy fucking shit.

02:46.041 --> 02:48.836
<i>Right now we're gonna talk about GameStop.
Those shares...</i>

02:48.836 --> 02:52.047
- <i>are nonstop earning of about 130% today.</i>
- Holy fucking shit!

02:52.047 --> 02:53.757
- Holy shit!
- What the...

02:53.757 --> 02:55.008
...fuck!

02:59.555 --> 03:00.681
Holy shit.

03:00.681 --> 03:02.516
- Yes. Hello?
- <i>Great news, Mr. Plotkin.</i>

03:02.516 --> 03:05.227
<i>I think we'll be able to get you
into your new home a little sooner</i>

03:05.227 --> 03:07.145
- <i>than I actually thought.</i>
- I think we're having some sort of

03:07.145 --> 03:09.648
miscommunication here. Because I'm not
trying to move into that house.

03:09.648 --> 03:12.401
I'm trying to tear that house down
so I can build a tennis court

03:12.401 --> 03:14.403
for me and my family to play
during the pandemic.

03:14.403 --> 03:15.904
- <i>I see.</i>
- I thought it would be very simple.

03:15.904 --> 03:17.865
Apparently, it isn't because
the pandemic is almost over

03:17.865 --> 03:19.491
- and there's no tennis court.
- <i>Okay, Mr. Plotkin.</i>

03:19.491 --> 03:20.909
Thank you for your time.

03:20.909 --> 03:22.661
Yes, what? Hello?

03:22.661 --> 03:25.497
Hi, it's Ken Griffin.

03:31.044 --> 03:33.380
Hi there, Ken, how are you?
Great to hear from you.

03:34.548 --> 03:35.591
Do you have a minute?

03:37.676 --> 03:38.760
I...

03:40.345 --> 03:42.848
<i>I gotta call you right back.
If that's okay. I'm so sorry.</i>

03:44.057 --> 03:45.392
- Sure.
- <i>Okay, great.</i>

03:46.935 --> 03:48.478
Hi. What's happening right now?

03:48.478 --> 03:51.023
It looks like there's one guy driving
all the buying.

03:51.023 --> 03:52.357
What... what... what guy?

03:53.525 --> 03:56.570
<i>I believe his name is "Roaring Kitty."</i>

03:59.865 --> 04:01.116
<i>Oh, wait, or...</i>

04:02.993 --> 04:04.828
<i>"Deep Fucking Value."</i>

04:04.828 --> 04:07.456
<i>"Roaring Kitty" or "Deep Fucking Value."
What?</i>

04:08.415 --> 04:11.543
He's "Roaring Kitty" on YouTube
and "Deep Fucking Value" on Reddit.

04:11.543 --> 04:14.087
<i>Both? He couldn't pick one name?</i>

04:14.087 --> 04:15.839
I don't know. I love this guy.

04:22.971 --> 04:24.389
Who is this schmuck?

04:24.389 --> 04:26.266
<i>I don't know, but I think I just came.</i>

05:32.040 --> 05:34.251
- Ruby... Ruby, right?
- Yeah.

05:34.251 --> 05:35.794
- Can I get a couple of Heinies, please?
- One.

05:35.794 --> 05:37.629
Sorry...

05:37.629 --> 05:39.965
- I'm gonna have a...
- What? What's wrong with a Heinie?

05:39.965 --> 05:41.466
Drinking it since we were 17!

05:41.466 --> 05:43.552
Hey, drink what you like. No judgment.

05:44.136 --> 05:45.220
You have a Hamm's?

05:45.220 --> 05:47.806
- I'll have one of those.
- The fuck did you just order?

05:47.806 --> 05:50.684
Oh, it's a nice one outta Milwaukee.
Good quality.

05:50.684 --> 05:53.604
- Fifty cents a can before markup.
- C'mon, Kitty. Forget about price.

05:53.604 --> 05:54.855
Get him a Heineken, thank you.

05:54.855 --> 05:56.315
- It's on me.
- Thanks, man.

05:56.315 --> 05:59.026
Thank you, that's nice.
I'll have a Hamm's.

05:59.026 --> 06:00.652
So a Heineken and a Hamm's?

06:00.652 --> 06:01.778
Thank you.

06:01.778 --> 06:02.988
Please.

06:02.988 --> 06:04.323
Thank you, Ruby.

06:09.953 --> 06:10.954
How you been, man?

06:10.954 --> 06:13.081
The whole Sara thing.

06:13.081 --> 06:16.293
Oh, yeah. Okay...

06:16.293 --> 06:17.711
Up and down.

06:18.337 --> 06:19.463
Yeah.

06:21.173 --> 06:22.758
- How's your asshole brother?
- Still an asshole.

06:22.758 --> 06:24.551
- Okay.
- Yeah.

06:25.135 --> 06:26.762
Keeping busy at least?

06:26.762 --> 06:30.057
Got the day job at MassMutual.
Working on my portfolio.

06:30.057 --> 06:32.059
That's the last thing you should be
worrying about right now.

06:32.768 --> 06:34.770
Why? It's a... It's a good distraction.

06:34.770 --> 06:36.146
Lemme take that over for you.

06:36.146 --> 06:37.689
We got thousands of analysts at B of A

06:37.689 --> 06:40.150
- that do just this. C'mon, Kitty.
- All good, man. Thank you.

06:40.150 --> 06:41.693
You should be focused on your family
right now.

06:41.693 --> 06:43.195
Not fucking around with penny stocks.

06:43.195 --> 06:45.906
They're not all penny stocks.
GameStop isn't a penny stock.

06:45.906 --> 06:47.407
GameStop?

06:47.407 --> 06:48.867
- Dude...
- You used to love GameStop!

06:48.867 --> 06:52.037
- Yeah, then I grew up.
- Well, I think it's undervalued.

06:52.621 --> 06:54.623
I just sold off a bunch of other shit
to double down.

06:54.623 --> 06:56.583
How much are we talking? A grand?

06:56.583 --> 06:57.709
- Fifty.
- Bucks?

06:57.709 --> 06:58.836
Grand.

06:58.836 --> 06:59.962
53 grand.

07:00.671 --> 07:01.922
Yeah.

07:06.552 --> 07:07.469
Kitty...

07:09.346 --> 07:11.557
- Man, you don't even own a house.
- It's got a ton of short interest,

07:11.557 --> 07:13.392
- You got a one-year-old.
- which is artificially pushing...

07:13.392 --> 07:14.810
- Jesus, bro.
- the price down.

07:14.810 --> 07:17.271
- You never bet against Wall Street!
- Wall Street gets it wrong all the time.

07:17.271 --> 07:18.814
- Look at '08.
- That was a one-off, Kitty.

07:18.814 --> 07:20.274
These guys, they have all the money

07:20.274 --> 07:22.401
and the fancy degrees
and the political juice in the world,

07:22.401 --> 07:24.611
- and they get it wrong all the time.
- Are you out of your fucking mind?

07:24.611 --> 07:27.406
They've got the advantage,
and they still get it wrong.

07:29.032 --> 07:31.577
No, gimme that, I'm drinking it.
Even if it's 50 cents.

07:31.577 --> 07:32.661
It's 4 bucks.

07:32.661 --> 07:34.746
Well, my man just spent 53K
on a penny stock.

07:34.746 --> 07:36.623
So, all he can afford is water.

07:36.623 --> 07:39.126
- You're a Wall Street guy?
- Very much no.

07:39.126 --> 07:40.669
I'm a Wall Street guy.

07:40.669 --> 07:42.171
What was the stock?

07:43.422 --> 07:44.506
GameStop.

07:45.883 --> 07:47.176
The video game store. At the mall.

07:47.176 --> 07:50.804
- You really bought $53,000 of it?
- Yeah, I don't believe it.

07:50.804 --> 07:52.973
I think he's fucking with us.
You're fucking with us, right?

07:52.973 --> 07:54.683
You don't even have 50 grand.

07:54.683 --> 07:55.851
Let's see.

07:58.270 --> 07:59.396
Oh, shit.

08:01.481 --> 08:03.400
How is she falling for this?
How are you falling for this?

08:03.400 --> 08:05.777
He won't spend 5 bucks for a beer,

08:05.777 --> 08:09.198
but he'll put 50k in a stock
that you think is a joke.

08:09.198 --> 08:10.782
And that's interesting to you?

08:11.658 --> 08:12.743
Yeah.

08:13.952 --> 08:15.078
It is.

08:21.043 --> 08:22.628
Drink your shitty beer.

08:32.095 --> 08:34.640
Hey!

08:36.600 --> 08:38.143
Bedtime's already done?

08:38.143 --> 08:41.522
Yeah, she was exhausted.
She skipped her nap.

08:43.315 --> 08:44.858
How was Briggsy?

08:44.858 --> 08:46.318
Good. Yeah.

08:54.618 --> 08:56.370
You guys talk about Sara?

09:02.793 --> 09:04.461
You wanna sit down a minute?

09:04.461 --> 09:06.630
I'll feel better if I finish these first.

09:07.673 --> 09:09.842
No, you won't.

09:35.242 --> 09:36.243
Do you think I'm insane?

09:36.243 --> 09:37.578
Yeah.

09:38.871 --> 09:40.497
Sorry. About what?

09:41.665 --> 09:42.791
GameStop.

09:42.791 --> 09:45.544
The most compelling
asymmetric opportunity in the market?

09:47.671 --> 09:49.965
- What, did Briggsy make you jumpy?
- A little.

09:49.965 --> 09:52.092
- What was his argument?
- He didn't have one.

09:52.092 --> 09:54.678
- Well.
- He just said it was a reckless bet.

09:54.678 --> 09:56.263
He said "you're putting your money
in the next

09:56.263 --> 09:57.973
- Blockbuster."
- Enough. Fuck Briggsy.

09:57.973 --> 10:01.351
Babe, you literally know more about
this damn company than you know about me.

10:01.810 --> 10:02.936
It's true.

10:02.936 --> 10:05.731
And because of you, I know more about
this company than I know about myself.

10:05.731 --> 10:09.526
But what if I'm missing something?
We can't afford to miss something.

10:10.861 --> 10:12.613
It's all our savings.

10:13.322 --> 10:14.489
Go do a video.

10:15.782 --> 10:17.618
I can finish these first. I'm happy to...

10:17.618 --> 10:19.745
Go see what the nerds have to say.

10:19.745 --> 10:22.414
Our Wall Street Bets people
aren't nerds, Caroline.

10:22.414 --> 10:24.917
They're gangsters.
You make a dumb case and post it,

10:24.917 --> 10:27.336
- they'll rip you apart.
- Well, then don't make a dumb case.

10:46.480 --> 10:47.981
Okay, let's see what's new.

10:50.943 --> 10:52.986
Oh, there's a share. Okay, here we go.

10:55.906 --> 10:57.199
Oh shit.

11:20.556 --> 11:22.015
Alright...

11:22.808 --> 11:25.394
Just check on... See here.

11:35.696 --> 11:38.448
Yo, what up, everybody?
Roaring Kitty here.

11:38.448 --> 11:41.827
I've done a few of these now,
mostly on my investing methodology.

11:41.827 --> 11:44.413
But today I'm gonna try something
a little different.

11:44.413 --> 11:47.833
I appreciate the feedback
you guys have been leaving me by the way.

11:48.667 --> 11:51.503
Oh! More feedback comin' in hot.

11:51.503 --> 11:55.299
"Less cats." Okay. Great.

11:55.299 --> 11:59.887
Ah, like I was saying, what was I saying?
Ah, I'm gonna try...

11:59.887 --> 12:02.097
Oh, and here's one from Ballz.

12:02.097 --> 12:03.599
"Nerd."

12:03.599 --> 12:05.601
And nerd is in all capitals.

12:05.601 --> 12:09.605
Like, okay, that's kinda mean.
But okay, fair.

12:10.814 --> 12:12.733
"Nice shirt, Grandpa"?

12:12.733 --> 12:16.028
What? How old do you think I am?

12:16.028 --> 12:16.987
You know what?

12:16.987 --> 12:20.157
Thanks for the comments.
We're gonna come back to them at the end.

12:20.157 --> 12:21.366
Here's what I wanna talk about.

12:22.576 --> 12:25.537
I'm gonna pick a stock and talk about
why I think it's interesting.

12:25.537 --> 12:27.456
And that stock is...

12:28.916 --> 12:30.125
GameStop.

12:31.710 --> 12:33.629
I know it's a polarizing stock and...

12:33.629 --> 12:35.923
some of you probably gonna tune out
of the stream right now when you hear

12:35.923 --> 12:38.133
I'm bullish on GameStop. But I am.

12:38.133 --> 12:42.179
You can see it is now the biggest position
by far in the Roaring Kitty portfolio.

12:42.179 --> 12:43.096
So...

12:43.096 --> 12:46.141
yeah, I think everyone else is crazy,
and I think I'm right.

12:46.141 --> 12:49.937
But I've been wrong plenty of times
in the past. So...

12:50.771 --> 12:54.233
<i>So there are a lot of aspects to this
bold thesis, a lot of moving parts,</i>

12:54.233 --> 12:56.735
<i>but I boil it down
to what I consider the three overs:</i>

12:56.735 --> 12:59.154
The digital risks seem to me
to be overblown,

12:59.154 --> 13:02.241
the negative sentiment is overdone, you
can see it with the huge short interest,

13:02.241 --> 13:04.201
and the value is overlooked.

13:04.201 --> 13:06.370
Wall Street just doesn't see it.

13:06.995 --> 13:08.163
Why?

13:08.163 --> 13:11.416
Mr. Market, why?

13:12.167 --> 13:14.878
<i>The hedge funds are overlooking
the value in the company</i>

13:14.878 --> 13:17.631
<i>just like they overlook
the people who shop there.</i>

13:17.631 --> 13:20.342
<i>They assume most people download
games online now.</i>

13:20.342 --> 13:24.680
<i>But look, 25% of gamers
still buy new discs from GameStop,</i>

13:24.680 --> 13:27.599
<i>and 40% buy used games from the store.</i>

13:27.599 --> 13:29.726
<i>And the market's kinda forced
my hand here.</i>

13:29.726 --> 13:32.646
<i>What more can I say?
I just like the stock.</i>

13:32.646 --> 13:33.730
Hey!

13:34.439 --> 13:35.858
Shit!

13:36.900 --> 13:38.569
- Did I wake you?
- Please stop.

13:38.569 --> 13:41.488
Mr. Donaldson, I need you in your bed.

13:41.488 --> 13:42.990
Kerin, can you please

13:42.990 --> 13:44.741
- make sure Mr. Donaldson...
- I don't need to go to bed.

13:44.741 --> 13:47.244
- I need a cup of coffee.
- We can get you a cup of coffee.

13:47.244 --> 13:48.787
Kerin, coffee.

13:48.787 --> 13:49.913
Oh!

13:50.581 --> 13:51.748
Well, isn't that beautiful?

13:52.332 --> 13:53.458
Oh shit.

13:54.877 --> 13:59.673
"100% short GameStop stock (GME)"?

13:59.673 --> 14:01.008
It's an investment video.

14:01.008 --> 14:03.635
Hey, Jenny, for real,

14:03.635 --> 14:06.471
I wouldn't take investment advice
from a guy in a cat shirt.

14:06.471 --> 14:09.099
Oh, okay.
Who do you take investment advice from?

14:09.099 --> 14:15.772
I don't have investments. And if I did,
I'd listen to, like, a banker.

14:15.772 --> 14:17.274
Just the way they like it.

14:17.274 --> 14:21.236
"They." Oh boy. Here we go...

14:21.236 --> 14:22.446
Just never mind.

14:22.446 --> 14:23.864
No, no, no, please tell me.

14:23.864 --> 14:27.075
I'm dying to know what Luke Wilson
from <i>The Royal Tenenbaums</i>

14:27.075 --> 14:29.703
thinks we should do
with our $68,000 a year.

14:29.703 --> 14:30.829
Who from what?

14:30.829 --> 14:31.914
Ugly Björn Borg.

14:31.914 --> 14:33.081
Okay, fine.

14:33.081 --> 14:36.001
Wall Street is betting
that this company is gonna fail.

14:36.001 --> 14:37.586
It's called shorting.

14:37.586 --> 14:41.173
And if it fails, well, then
everybody loses their job,

14:41.173 --> 14:43.842
but these hedge fund assholes make
a shit ton of money.

14:44.301 --> 14:48.180
It's bullshit. It's a bullshit way
for rich people to get richer.

14:48.180 --> 14:49.848
How did you even find this guy?

14:49.848 --> 14:52.476
70,000 people have watched this video.

14:52.476 --> 14:54.895
He posts his balance sheets
and everything.

14:54.895 --> 14:56.730
Wall Street Bets is going crazy over this.

14:56.730 --> 14:58.857
- Who?
- It's an Internet forum.

15:00.734 --> 15:01.985
- On Reddit.
- Now, see. No, no.

15:01.985 --> 15:04.363
I'm not gonna do this with you.
The last time you brought up Reddit,

15:04.363 --> 15:07.115
it was just all these oil paintings of
Donald Trump on horseback.

15:07.115 --> 15:08.909
- You liked it.
- Detestable.

15:08.909 --> 15:11.578
- Look.
- Okay, yeah. Let's take a look.

15:13.247 --> 15:15.624
"Shit's not a pump-and-dump

15:15.624 --> 15:19.002
if it never dumps, you fuckheads..."

15:19.002 --> 15:23.131
"Feed me your tears, I use it
as anal lube on your wives."

15:23.131 --> 15:24.258
Why did you go to that one?

15:24.258 --> 15:27.803
Oh! Oh! Oh! "Strap on ur theta dildo

15:27.803 --> 15:31.932
- n start pounding."
- Okay. Yes, that shit exists on here.

15:31.932 --> 15:35.727
But I also learned the difference between
a delta squeeze and a gamma squeeze.

15:35.727 --> 15:37.729
And now everyone is talking about
call options.

15:37.729 --> 15:39.314
Jenny, baby,

15:39.898 --> 15:41.275
you're never gonna find a man on there.

15:42.776 --> 15:44.945
And you're never gonna date Puff Daddy.

15:44.945 --> 15:47.364
First of all, no one has said Puff Daddy
since the '90s

15:47.364 --> 15:49.741
and second of all, this isn't Puff Daddy.

15:50.534 --> 15:51.702
This is Loop Daddy.

15:52.619 --> 15:56.498
Okay, well, whatever Daddy he's called,
he's weird looking.

15:56.498 --> 15:59.251
Hey, well, my guy has, what,
5 million TikTok followers.

15:59.251 --> 16:01.003
- How many does yours have?
- I don't know.

16:01.003 --> 16:03.755
Quick scroll. 412.

16:03.755 --> 16:06.091
- Who cares?
- The Internet at large.

16:06.091 --> 16:08.135
But hey. Least I aim high.

16:09.178 --> 16:10.304
I aim high.

16:46.423 --> 16:48.926
<i>What up, everybody? Roaring Kitty here.</i>

16:48.926 --> 16:53.889
<i>Yo! Yo! Yo! This price action,
gettin' kind of ridiculous, am I right?</i>

16:53.889 --> 16:56.183
<i>Let's see what happens.
See what happens at the end of the week.</i>

16:56.183 --> 16:58.519
<i>But it's all about the trend
staying intact.</i>

16:58.519 --> 17:00.479
<i>But this, this looks sick.</i>

17:03.982 --> 17:05.108
Morning, Marcos!

17:05.608 --> 17:08.569
Shit... Yo, what's... Hey, Brad.

17:15.786 --> 17:19.623
Yo, I was wondering if could I get
an advance on my pay?

17:20.249 --> 17:24.211
I can run it up the chain, but
with all the cutbacks, that's unlikely.

17:25.295 --> 17:27.422
Oh, hey! You could do
the employee TikTok contest.

17:27.422 --> 17:29.883
You do a lip sync,
you can win 10 labor hours.

17:29.883 --> 17:31.593
Yeah, man, totally.

17:32.302 --> 17:35.264
That's dope. I was thinkin' "Savage."

17:36.640 --> 17:38.600
Yeah, sure, I love it.

17:38.600 --> 17:41.061
Or yo, that Drake one with Lil Durk.

17:42.688 --> 17:43.897
That's a great one too.

17:43.897 --> 17:45.691
Because I know you love Lil Durk.

17:46.233 --> 17:47.192
C'mon.

17:47.192 --> 17:49.778
No, I'm gonna do Megan Thee Stallion.
For sure, for sure, for sure.

17:49.778 --> 17:50.821
<i>I'm a savage</i>

17:51.530 --> 17:53.824
<i>Classy, bougie, ratchet</i>

17:53.824 --> 17:56.535
<i>Sassy, moody, nasty</i>

17:56.535 --> 17:58.662
Okay, mask! Mask.

17:59.788 --> 18:01.081
Sorry.

18:01.081 --> 18:03.625
<i>Acting stupid, what was happening?</i>

18:04.168 --> 18:06.170
<i>What's happening? I'm a savage</i>

18:06.170 --> 18:09.381
Huh, A+ man. You're a shoo-in
with moves like that.

18:09.381 --> 18:11.300
Yo, you think so for real, though?

18:12.342 --> 18:14.052
That's sweet, real.

18:14.845 --> 18:16.180
Ten labor hours.

18:16.972 --> 18:18.348
Damn, it's like Christmas came early!

18:20.017 --> 18:21.518
I'm pullin' for ya!

18:21.518 --> 18:22.895
Thanks, man.

18:38.577 --> 18:40.829
<i>...only fit fake booties</i>

18:40.829 --> 18:41.955
<i>Fuck cash shit</i>

18:45.125 --> 18:46.460
Fries.

18:55.010 --> 18:56.803
No, fuck!

18:57.971 --> 18:58.889
God!

18:58.889 --> 19:01.058
Goddamn it! Fuck!

19:01.058 --> 19:04.019
But first, cheers! Cheers, everybody.

19:04.019 --> 19:07.189
I mean, look. I know we still got
a lot of bear takes out there.

19:07.189 --> 19:08.857
But as I dive deeper and deeper
into this thing,

19:08.857 --> 19:10.943
it's looking increasingly
compelling to me.

19:10.943 --> 19:14.154
And then you got the huge short interest.
Now, I'm not betting on a short squeeze.

19:14.154 --> 19:16.490
I've been saying that the whole time.
You guys have been talking about it.

19:16.490 --> 19:18.075
Thesis is grounded in fundamentals,
but I'm not...

19:18.075 --> 19:19.701
But to... I mean, today, I mean, I'm...

19:19.701 --> 19:21.411
I mean, it's starting to feel
a little squeezy, right?

19:21.411 --> 19:22.913
Starting to feel a little squeezy. Honk!

19:22.913 --> 19:24.456
I mean, hello. Okay!

19:24.456 --> 19:26.667
All right, all right. I need a drink.
I need a drink.

19:29.086 --> 19:32.506
Now. A lot of you are accusing me
of talking a big game.

19:32.506 --> 19:33.674
- Keith?
- But--

19:33.674 --> 19:36.718
- Babe, where are you?
- Oh... Coming!

19:37.553 --> 19:40.138
Duh... I'm on Daddy duty tonight.
I'll be right back.

20:09.168 --> 20:11.670
Okay. There you go.

20:14.298 --> 20:15.382
Sorry.

20:15.382 --> 20:16.925
Quick tendie break.

20:18.427 --> 20:19.678
Gotta love those tendies.

20:19.678 --> 20:21.054
Sweet, sweet tendies.

20:22.014 --> 20:23.599
Speaking of tendies.

20:24.641 --> 20:27.436
Look at this. Look at this chart.

20:28.687 --> 20:32.399
We go from four, to six, to seven. Now...

20:32.941 --> 20:33.901
ten.

20:34.484 --> 20:37.154
Wall Street must be seeing this, right?

20:37.154 --> 20:39.656
Or are we just screaming into the void?

20:39.656 --> 20:43.118
Hello, Mr. Market. We got tendies too.

20:43.118 --> 20:45.537
We got tendies too.

20:47.331 --> 20:48.290
Maybe we are.

20:48.290 --> 20:53.712
They never saw the, like, 9 billion
resumes I sent from 2016 to 2019.

20:53.712 --> 20:56.215
Or in 2009,
right after I graduated college.

20:56.215 --> 20:59.801
I guess they were busy
with that whole "market crash" thing then.

21:05.641 --> 21:06.475
Fuck!

21:15.526 --> 21:16.818
Kevin, you son of a bitch!

21:16.818 --> 21:18.779
You can't run with a baby.
You can't run with a baby!

21:18.779 --> 21:21.865
- Don't take my car, man!
- I fucked up your seat!

21:21.865 --> 21:23.492
There's no gas left.

21:25.619 --> 21:27.120
I know.

21:36.880 --> 21:38.674
How did that taste?

21:40.968 --> 21:43.011
Hey-oh, can I put my pants back on?

21:43.011 --> 21:44.096
No!

21:44.096 --> 21:49.518
"Choose a player and put your hand
down their panties for a whole minute."

21:49.518 --> 21:51.061
Panties, who's got panties?

21:51.061 --> 21:53.313
"Two shots if they refuse."

21:53.313 --> 21:54.982
I mean, I got some panties.

21:56.692 --> 21:57.860
Bro.

22:00.863 --> 22:02.239
- Hello.
- All right.

22:04.157 --> 22:05.951
- All right.
- Hey, girl.

22:05.951 --> 22:07.452
You said two shots, right?

22:07.452 --> 22:08.871
Oh, c'mon.

22:10.789 --> 22:12.249
Fuck, all good.

22:12.249 --> 22:14.668
- Can someone start the timer?
- I got you. I got you.

22:14.668 --> 22:17.087
- Should I just...? Okay.
- Get in there.

22:17.087 --> 22:18.589
- You sure?
- Yeah.

22:22.050 --> 22:23.385
Okay...

22:24.052 --> 22:26.263
Hi.

22:28.515 --> 22:29.892
How are you?

22:31.018 --> 22:32.436
Can you shut the fuck up?

22:32.436 --> 22:34.021
Fuck off!

22:35.230 --> 22:36.732
So what'd you do today?

22:36.732 --> 22:40.402
Well, I attended a Zoom seminar

22:40.402 --> 22:44.239
during which I watched
two hours of TikTok.

22:47.159 --> 22:50.495
Oh! I purchased three shares of stock.

22:51.413 --> 22:52.831
Okay, what stock?

22:52.831 --> 22:55.626
- GameStop.
- Yo, Roaring Kitty!

22:55.626 --> 22:57.294
C'mon. Yes, James.

22:59.087 --> 23:00.797
- Can I please put some pants back on?
- No!

23:00.797 --> 23:02.591
- Sit down.
- <i>I'm three days into that shit.</i>

23:02.591 --> 23:05.719
<i>Look it. That's just, that's only
from today. I don't care.</i>

23:05.719 --> 23:08.180
<i>I don't know what the fuck I'm doing.
I just know I'm making money.</i>

23:08.180 --> 23:09.723
I'm not sold on that.

23:09.723 --> 23:11.517
It's doubled since summer.

23:11.517 --> 23:13.977
And the more people
who buy in, the higher it'll go.

23:13.977 --> 23:16.438
That sounds like the literal definition
of a pyramid scheme.

23:17.314 --> 23:18.941
- That's time.
- Bravo!

23:42.297 --> 23:46.134
Sorry, I have terrible allergies.
And a killer headache.

23:46.134 --> 23:48.387
<i>Could just be the music coming
from next door though.</i>

23:48.387 --> 23:52.224
You see your buddy Ken's up to
57 billion in short positions?

23:52.224 --> 23:54.226
Yeah, smart. The economy's in free fall.

23:58.438 --> 24:00.816
I honestly can't tell
if that was you or Romeo.

24:00.816 --> 24:02.442
Very funny.

24:02.442 --> 24:05.529
I'm telling you. This is when
they drag out the guillotines.

24:06.113 --> 24:08.240
- You're obsessed with him.
<i>- The man is an asshole.</i>

24:08.240 --> 24:12.286
He stole five analysts from me.
All mediocre by the way.

24:13.078 --> 24:14.288
Oh, and two paintings.

24:14.288 --> 24:16.582
- <i>What paintings?</i>
- A Picasso and a de Kooning.

24:16.582 --> 24:18.083
He overpaid 500 million.

24:18.083 --> 24:20.294
That is my entire nut from last year.

24:20.294 --> 24:22.087
The man is an asshole. Just admit it.

24:22.087 --> 24:24.506
You're just bitter he stole
those analysts.

24:24.506 --> 24:26.550
You seen Citadel's projected revenue?

24:26.550 --> 24:28.760
<i>$7 billion.</i>

24:28.760 --> 24:31.388
That's double last year.

24:31.388 --> 24:33.515
<i>Hoovering up all the stimulus checks</i>.

24:33.515 --> 24:35.601
<i>- They go straight from the retail traders</i>
- Thank you.

24:35.601 --> 24:37.394
right into Kenny boy's pockets.

24:37.394 --> 24:41.565
The man just gets away with murder.
Look at what I just sent you.

24:49.239 --> 24:52.826
Is this a video of a man drinking
his own urine because a stock went up?

24:52.826 --> 24:54.077
<i>#1 post on the site.</i>

24:54.077 --> 24:55.704
Where did you get this?

24:55.704 --> 24:57.664
<i>My analysts sent it to me.</i>

24:57.664 --> 25:02.836
They call themselves apes and r-words.
Retard, can they say that?

25:02.836 --> 25:06.965
Remarkably self-aware. They've hooked
into GameStop for whatever reason.

25:06.965 --> 25:08.717
<i>They think it's funny, it seems.</i>

25:08.717 --> 25:10.135
I think it's funny.

25:10.135 --> 25:11.803
I think they think it's a good investment.

25:11.803 --> 25:14.181
Retail traders always lose.

25:16.016 --> 25:18.143
We've actually been short GameStop
since 2014.

25:18.143 --> 25:23.190
The company is a complete disaster.
They've had six CEOs in two years.

25:24.191 --> 25:26.693
Guess these guys are ignoring
obvious secular market trends.

25:26.693 --> 25:29.821
Or they're... the stupidest people
on earth.

25:29.821 --> 25:32.282
You're shorting more right now,
aren't you?

25:32.282 --> 25:34.785
600,000 shares, maybe.

25:35.369 --> 25:36.995
Dumb money, man.

25:36.995 --> 25:38.497
I'm happy to take it.

25:47.798 --> 25:49.633
<i>Listen up, retards,</i>

25:49.633 --> 25:54.680
<i>Melvin Capital has declared war on GME
by shorting the stock even more.</i>

25:54.680 --> 25:58.767
<i>This is our call to activate
diamond hands, my fellow warriors.</i>

25:58.767 --> 26:03.772
<i>We will not let the gay bears defeat us.
We are on a mission to the fucking moon.</i>

26:03.772 --> 26:06.817
<i>This is one that is bigger than
your personal gains.</i>

26:06.817 --> 26:09.444
<i>More than just tendies for a new Lambo.</i>

26:09.444 --> 26:13.615
<i>This is our chance to rise up together.
To stick it to the big man.</i>

26:13.615 --> 26:15.868
<i>Squeezing Melvin by the fucking balls</i>

26:15.868 --> 26:18.787
<i>with the collective power
of diamond handing autists.</i>

26:19.371 --> 26:22.791
<i>Wall Street Bets I thought were a bunch
of idiots just throwing money at a stock</i>

26:22.791 --> 26:24.501
<i>because they thought it was funny</i>.

26:24.501 --> 26:25.836
<i>I was wrong.</i>

26:25.836 --> 26:28.380
<i>Now I see what Wall Street Bets really is.</i>

26:28.380 --> 26:31.425
<i>- It is a revolution.
- This is one of those rare moments</i>

26:31.425 --> 26:33.552
<i>where Wall Street are the ones
getting screwed over.</i>

26:33.552 --> 26:35.220
<i>And when we decide we're hungry,</i>

26:35.220 --> 26:37.723
<i>there is very little
the rich can do to stop us</i>

26:37.723 --> 26:39.766
<i>- from beating them.
- It's a GameStop to stop the game.</i>

26:39.766 --> 26:42.060
<i>- Power to the people.
- I'm jerking off right now.</i>

26:42.060 --> 26:43.103
<i>Jerking off right now.</i>

26:43.103 --> 26:47.691
<i>So welcome aboard, grab your peanuts,
and get the fuck in, retard.</i>

26:47.691 --> 26:49.735
Ho, ho, ho!

26:49.735 --> 26:54.489
What up, everybody? Merry Christmas,
Happy New Year's, happy holidays.

26:55.365 --> 26:57.701
2020... See ya.

26:57.701 --> 27:00.829
2020 has been a very rough year
for my family too.

27:00.829 --> 27:03.916
So this GameStop news has been
a bit of a bright spot.

27:04.583 --> 27:06.502
Look at this, I mean, where it's at.

27:06.502 --> 27:10.214
It's a five bagger from where it was
over the summer.

27:10.214 --> 27:14.301
You don't often see a thesis
play out like this.

27:14.301 --> 27:15.344
So we gotta--

27:15.344 --> 27:17.930
We can't take it for granted, right?
We gotta appreciate it.

27:18.514 --> 27:21.391
<i>Thank you, Santa. Right.</i>

27:22.809 --> 27:25.812
<i>I wanted to say cheers all of you.</i>

27:25.812 --> 27:28.065
You're why I'm here in the first place.

27:30.025 --> 27:33.195
It's fun to talk about. I mean, I figure,
if I worked at a hedge fund,

27:33.195 --> 27:34.821
<i>I'd compare notes with my colleagues.
But I don't.</i>

27:34.821 --> 27:36.823
<i>I'm stuck at home like you guys. So...</i>

27:37.533 --> 27:39.368
<i>I believe in this stock.</i>

27:39.368 --> 27:41.828
<i>And I believe in this community.</i>

27:43.664 --> 27:48.460
<i>I'll be honest,
it's been kind of a shitty year.</i>

27:50.170 --> 27:54.466
<i>For a lot of people. Lotta people
lost people the past 12 months. I did too.</i>

27:54.466 --> 27:56.593
My sister, Sara.

28:05.769 --> 28:07.646
I don't talk about it much.

28:09.439 --> 28:11.400
<i>But it felt right to tell you.</i>

28:11.400 --> 28:13.735
<i>We've been through so much together.</i>

28:13.735 --> 28:16.864
<i>You've made me feel a part of something,
something big.</i>

28:17.823 --> 28:20.659
<i>So, Merry Christmas. Cheers.</i>

28:54.526 --> 28:55.652
I like your car.

28:58.155 --> 28:59.364
It's a classic.

28:59.364 --> 29:01.033
- '95.
- Yes!

29:01.033 --> 29:02.910
Sadly, it's a gas-guzzler.

29:02.910 --> 29:05.412
Yeah, yup, this one too.

29:06.371 --> 29:10.417
But she's such a beauty I couldn't stand
to trade her.

29:10.417 --> 29:12.085
'96 Honda Accord?

29:12.753 --> 29:15.506
2003. Not quite a classic.

29:23.889 --> 29:27.976
It's kinda weird to talk to someone
and see their whole face. Right?

29:27.976 --> 29:29.520
It's been so long.

29:30.354 --> 29:34.107
I... I work at a hospital,
you could probably tell.

29:34.107 --> 29:35.359
Essential worker.

29:35.943 --> 29:37.361
Thank you for everything you do.

29:37.361 --> 29:38.612
Oh, you're very welcome.

29:50.123 --> 29:51.542
Hey...

29:52.668 --> 29:54.086
Have a good night.

29:55.003 --> 29:56.129
Cool.

29:56.922 --> 29:58.423
Safe travels.

30:15.107 --> 30:17.276
<i>Remember when you were just
making fun of me</i>

30:17.276 --> 30:20.696
- and now you're literally obsessed.
- No, I don't recall.

30:20.696 --> 30:23.740
- How much are you up?
- 948.

30:23.740 --> 30:26.869
Stock dipped a little,
it was like 2,000 before Christmas.

30:26.869 --> 30:28.495
Maybe you should sell.

30:30.664 --> 30:32.791
No. It's not about the money.

30:32.791 --> 30:34.710
The stock market is not about the money?

30:34.710 --> 30:37.379
No. You just gotta read
some of the stuff on here.

30:37.963 --> 30:41.675
Never understood why my dad
was so pissed off about this whole thing,

30:41.675 --> 30:42.801
but now I do.

30:44.386 --> 30:45.888
I told you about his store, right?

30:45.888 --> 30:47.347
Costco?

30:48.015 --> 30:49.516
Shopko.

30:49.516 --> 30:51.185
It was like, this like...

30:52.019 --> 30:53.812
big chain in our area.

30:54.646 --> 30:58.525
My dad, he worked his way all the way up
from bag boy to general manager.

30:59.276 --> 31:01.904
Then one of these Wall Street funds
came in, bought it,

31:01.904 --> 31:06.450
and vampire-sucked all the money out of it
and then declared bankruptcy.

31:06.450 --> 31:07.618
Fuck.

31:08.744 --> 31:09.828
Yeah.

31:11.538 --> 31:14.583
He lost his pension. Everything.

31:15.918 --> 31:18.795
It's why he had to work at
Pick 'n fuckin' Save till the day he died.

31:18.795 --> 31:21.256
And now that's why I'm up to my ass
in debt.

31:22.591 --> 31:25.260
And these fuckers are trying to do
the same thing to GameStop.

31:26.720 --> 31:27.888
Fuck 'em.

31:29.515 --> 31:30.849
Fuck 'em all.

31:52.496 --> 31:54.373
Wait, look.

31:54.373 --> 31:55.791
Look at this.

31:55.791 --> 31:58.669
- This guy wants to CashApp me $100
- Shut the fuck up.

31:58.669 --> 32:02.714
to send him a selfie. Or 500
if I live chat him from a bubble bath.

32:02.714 --> 32:04.633
Yes! Yes, we should do it.

32:04.633 --> 32:06.844
- What?
- Yes, we do it.

32:06.844 --> 32:09.304
And then put the money into GameStop.

32:09.847 --> 32:13.600
- Who am I talking to right now?
- C'mon, bitch, let's go get a tub.

32:27.406 --> 32:30.617
Your entire business is kids spending
their lunch money on random stocks.

32:30.617 --> 32:32.411
They come to you because it's free.

32:32.411 --> 32:36.540
But if you don't charge a commission
on their trades,

32:36.540 --> 32:38.458
how do you make money?

32:39.501 --> 32:45.090
The idea for Robinhood really came out
of the Occupy Wall Street movement.

32:45.090 --> 32:46.800
All those people
with no way of getting in.

32:46.800 --> 32:49.136
Is that what Occupy was about?

32:49.136 --> 32:51.930
I mean, were they trying to get in or...

32:51.930 --> 32:54.141
So we said, it's not enough to occupy.

32:54.141 --> 32:57.102
- We need to democratize Wall Street.
- Nat, I'm not sure you know this,

32:57.102 --> 32:58.562
but Baiju and I are both immigrants.

32:58.562 --> 33:00.397
I was born in Bulgaria,

33:00.397 --> 33:03.066
and Baiju's parents immigrated from India
to the Deep South.

33:03.942 --> 33:07.487
Can you imagine growing up
in rural Virginia with a name like

33:07.487 --> 33:09.740
Baiju Prafulkumar Bhatt?

33:10.741 --> 33:13.994
We created commission-free trading
so that anyone can get in the game.

33:13.994 --> 33:17.539
You don't even need a bank account.
People have really responded.

33:17.539 --> 33:21.502
We've added 5 million users
in the last six months,

33:21.502 --> 33:24.254
- for a total of...
- Close to 20 at this point. Million.

33:24.254 --> 33:27.341
So, you're one of these tech companies
that's exploded growth-wise,

33:27.341 --> 33:28.509
but doesn't make any money.

33:28.509 --> 33:30.344
- We make money.
- But how?

33:30.344 --> 33:33.347
- If you don't charge commission then...
- From interest on people's accounts.

33:33.347 --> 33:34.932
But your users are mostly young.

33:34.932 --> 33:37.100
So, how much money
can they really be keeping

33:37.100 --> 33:39.353
- in their account?
- There's also payment for order flow.

33:39.353 --> 33:40.270
What's that?

33:40.270 --> 33:43.148
We prefer the term "stock order routing."

33:43.148 --> 33:45.108
When you buy or sell a stock on our app,

33:45.108 --> 33:47.903
we send your order to market makers,
who process the order.

33:47.903 --> 33:50.280
They pay us a tiny rebate on every trade.

33:50.280 --> 33:52.074
- Tiny.
- But it adds up.

33:52.074 --> 33:53.742
We should really get back to how we...

33:53.742 --> 33:55.869
- started our company.
- What market maker do you work with?

33:55.869 --> 33:58.205
A few. Citadel Securities mostly.

33:58.205 --> 34:00.582
Ken Griffin's firm?
Isn't that a hedge fund?

34:00.582 --> 34:04.169
Well, Ken Griffin's hedge fund
is called Citadel.

34:04.169 --> 34:06.839
But Citadel Securities
is a completely different company.

34:06.839 --> 34:08.632
Also owned by Ken Griffin?

34:10.050 --> 34:11.134
All right,

34:11.802 --> 34:14.471
we weren't gonna do this,
but we'll give you a scoop.

34:15.138 --> 34:16.974
Off the record for now.

34:17.641 --> 34:18.684
Okay.

34:20.018 --> 34:21.937
We're looking to IPO soon.

34:23.813 --> 34:26.315
Damn. Okay.

34:27.442 --> 34:28.694
That's big.

34:54.469 --> 34:56.388
- Okay, don't say the bad word.
<i>- Be humble</i>

34:57.097 --> 34:58.682
<i>Sit down</i>

35:00.350 --> 35:02.936
<i>Sit down, be humble</i>

35:03.562 --> 35:04.855
<i>- Sit down
- Sit down</i>

35:11.737 --> 35:14.489
<i>- Be humble, sit down, lil bitch</i>
- Kev, please.

35:14.489 --> 35:16.825
<i>- Well, sit down, lil bitch</i>
- Your father needs to concentrate.

35:16.825 --> 35:20.245
Drove long-haul for forty years.
I don't need to concentrate.

35:20.245 --> 35:22.664
Fine. I need to concentrate.

35:22.664 --> 35:24.917
What do you need to concentrate about?

35:25.501 --> 35:26.335
What?

35:26.335 --> 35:28.128
I thought they were veering over
into our lane.

35:28.128 --> 35:30.881
Nobody was veering, Elaine. It's okay.

35:34.843 --> 35:36.887
You talk to any of the girls
at the clinic?

35:36.887 --> 35:38.597
A few of them have called.

35:41.975 --> 35:43.310
I miss it.

35:43.310 --> 35:45.145
Boys, never retire.

35:45.812 --> 35:47.481
Keith, never retire.

35:48.148 --> 35:50.150
Kevin, if you ever get a job,
never retire.

35:50.150 --> 35:51.235
I have a job!

35:51.235 --> 35:53.529
Yet you still live with Ma and Dad.

35:53.529 --> 35:57.157
Oh, you're some big professional now
cuz you're fucking king dork on YouTube?

35:57.157 --> 35:58.825
Just one of many dorks.

35:58.825 --> 36:00.786
This asshole
thinks he's Jimmy Buffett now.

36:00.786 --> 36:02.412
- C'mon.
- Warren Buffett.

36:02.412 --> 36:04.456
- Warren Buffett.
- See?

36:04.456 --> 36:07.459
You're not either of the Buffetts, Kitty!

36:10.712 --> 36:11.964
You're Ballz?

36:15.259 --> 36:16.969
- Hey!
- Ah, good Christ.

36:16.969 --> 36:17.886
- Fellas.
- Ma.

36:18.470 --> 36:20.347
Drop! Stop it!

36:24.810 --> 36:25.978
Door Dash is not a job.

36:27.145 --> 36:28.188
MassMutual's a job.

36:28.188 --> 36:30.440
- A job's got business cards.
- Door Dash is a job.

36:30.440 --> 36:31.733
Okay, I'm a first responder.

36:31.733 --> 36:34.528
And second of all, Ma,
nobody uses business cards anymore.

36:36.280 --> 36:38.198
We're proud of you, honey.

36:39.241 --> 36:40.492
Get a room.

37:00.387 --> 37:03.390
Take your time. I'll be in the car.

37:15.569 --> 37:16.904
Yeah.

37:25.495 --> 37:26.788
Love you.

37:50.854 --> 37:52.397
<i>It has been dragging on.</i>

37:52.397 --> 37:54.733
<i>Honestly, I don't know
when we'll be able to start demo</i>

37:54.733 --> 37:56.568
<i>because local ordinances are a nightmare.</i>

37:56.568 --> 37:59.821
<i>My heart bleeds for you.
Having to borrow a tennis court.</i>

37:59.821 --> 38:01.448
"Borrower is slave to the lender."

38:01.448 --> 38:02.699
Is that Buffett?

38:02.699 --> 38:04.576
It's the Bible. Proverbs.

38:04.576 --> 38:05.869
My Grandpa Melvin used to say it.

38:05.869 --> 38:07.579
When he was starting
his convenience store,

38:07.579 --> 38:08.830
he refused to borrow one dollar.

38:08.830 --> 38:09.957
It was a point of pride.

38:09.957 --> 38:11.750
Ah yes, your humble beginnings.

38:11.750 --> 38:15.879
"Grandpa Melvin" Capital, now with
16 billion under management.

38:16.463 --> 38:19.132
Better than "Citadel." You sound like
you're preparing for war.

38:19.132 --> 38:20.259
I'm a man of the people.

38:20.259 --> 38:21.468
You rented out a resort,

38:21.468 --> 38:24.888
relocated your entire firm here
so you could stay open during lockdown.

38:24.888 --> 38:28.141
Says the man who flew his whole firm down
private just for a party.

38:28.141 --> 38:30.060
And anyway, what kind of company
shuts down

38:30.060 --> 38:31.937
just because the government tells them to?

38:31.937 --> 38:34.147
All the ones in your short portfolio.

38:34.147 --> 38:35.399
And yours.

38:36.191 --> 38:38.735
<i>-All except for one actually.
- Which one?</i>

38:38.735 --> 38:40.696
<i>- GameStop.
- How?</i>

38:40.696 --> 38:43.365
<i>They sell computer mouses. Mice?</i>

38:43.365 --> 38:45.534
<i>They claim it makes them
an essential business.</i>

38:45.534 --> 38:48.120
<i>That is the smartest dumbest thing
I've ever heard.</i>

38:48.120 --> 38:49.246
<i>I know, it's actually a fun one.</i>

38:49.246 --> 38:53.709
<i>The revenue's in the toilet.
632 million net loss last year.</i>

38:53.709 --> 38:56.753
<i>They'd be better off just burning
the whole company down.</i>

38:56.753 --> 38:59.923
<i>The stock though, it has been volatile.
It's been up.</i>

38:59.923 --> 39:02.509
- Buybacks?
- Retail traders.

39:03.594 --> 39:04.678
Bro. I don't have it, bro.

39:04.678 --> 39:05.804
- Damn, brother.
- Sorry, man.

39:05.804 --> 39:07.306
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Have a good one, bro.

39:07.306 --> 39:08.307
- Yo, stay up though!
- Yeah.

39:08.307 --> 39:09.725
Aight, bro. Aight.

39:15.397 --> 39:17.024
I'm gonna put these back real quick.

39:24.531 --> 39:25.699
Hey, Marcos.

39:26.658 --> 39:27.826
Yes, Bradley?

39:29.870 --> 39:31.663
I... I love how you engaged
with that customer,

39:31.663 --> 39:33.957
but we really wanna close
those pre-owned sales.

39:33.957 --> 39:35.334
The margin's more than double.

39:35.334 --> 39:36.877
Oh shit, double.

39:36.877 --> 39:38.795
Yeah, you didn't do
any of the five prongs, dude:

39:38.795 --> 39:42.341
Pre-orders. Reward-card subscriptions.
Used sales. New sales. Trade-ins.

39:42.341 --> 39:43.926
Yeah, I mean,
when I was a 16-year-old gamer,

39:43.926 --> 39:46.053
all I wanted was a reward-card

39:46.053 --> 39:49.389
$5 cash back monthly,
20 points for every dollar spent...

39:49.973 --> 39:51.600
- Don't get me started.
- A lot of really smart people

39:51.600 --> 39:53.227
in corporate put this plan together.

39:53.227 --> 39:55.854
Yeah, but any of them ever
played a video game?

39:55.854 --> 39:58.774
It doesn't matter, Marcos,
because they own our asses.

39:58.774 --> 40:01.944
Yo, they don't own my ass, so.

40:02.486 --> 40:03.570
They do,

40:03.570 --> 40:05.030
and they always will.

40:08.116 --> 40:09.159
Mask.

40:11.078 --> 40:12.329
Hey, Bradley.

40:15.457 --> 40:17.543
You ever heard of a short squeeze?

40:25.300 --> 40:27.094
Is that a sexual thing?

40:28.929 --> 40:30.305
No.

40:31.723 --> 40:33.141
<i>Oh, yeah!</i>

40:33.141 --> 40:34.226
<i>Here's what's going on.</i>

40:34.226 --> 40:35.644
<i>Late last year,</i>

40:35.644 --> 40:40.440
<i>hedge funds started shorting stock
in the retail store GameStop.</i>

40:40.440 --> 40:44.027
<i>Meaning they had bet against it
and needed it to drop in price</i>

40:44.027 --> 40:47.823
<i>for their investments to be successful.
Now unfortunately for the hedge funds,</i>

40:47.823 --> 40:53.370
<i>small investors started buying the stock
led by something called Wall Street Bets,</i>

40:53.370 --> 40:57.040
<i>a popular, juvenile,
foul-mouthed Reddit page.</i>

40:57.040 --> 40:58.876
<i>And when Wall Street Bets noticed</i>

40:58.876 --> 41:02.546
<i>that hedge funds had taken
a large short position in GameStop stock,</i>

41:02.546 --> 41:05.382
<i>they decided to punish
the Wall Street big boys</i>

41:05.382 --> 41:08.218
<i>and launched a coordinated buying spree.</i>

41:08.844 --> 41:11.722
<i>The revolutionaries on Reddit
are spanking Wall Street's ass.</i>

41:11.722 --> 41:17.936
<i>GameStop shares absolutely going nuts.
I think it was up over 70% at one point.</i>

41:17.936 --> 41:19.897
- Massive short squeeze,
- Show me...

41:19.897 --> 41:22.649
- <i>closing there, with a gain of 51%</i>
- the tendiesss!

41:22.649 --> 41:24.610
<i>after traders on message boards...</i>

41:28.113 --> 41:29.448
What?

41:29.448 --> 41:34.453
Happy Wednesday! Happy hump day!
Gee... look at this!

41:34.453 --> 41:35.871
Look at this shit!

41:35.871 --> 41:39.082
A 90% increase in one day?
In one fucking day!

41:39.082 --> 41:42.711
We're goin' to the mooooon.

41:45.714 --> 41:48.258
Okay, now, if you've been watching
this price action,

41:48.258 --> 41:49.426
this is what I'm talking about.

41:49.426 --> 41:51.512
<i>Yeah, but you can really feel that panic
from Wall Street, right.</i>

41:51.512 --> 41:53.889
When they start... we're starting to feel
a little squeeze. Starting to feel it.

41:53.889 --> 41:55.432
You're starting to really feel
a little squeeze.

41:55.432 --> 41:58.227
I need a drink. I need a drink.
I know we all drinking tonight.

41:58.227 --> 41:59.770
We fucking did it!

41:59.770 --> 42:02.564
We started from the bottom
and now we're here!

42:03.732 --> 42:05.943
Let's raise a glass

42:05.943 --> 42:09.863
to a great company
that's undervalued, cheers.

42:10.447 --> 42:14.076
<i>Soon may the tendiemen come...
Show me the tendies. Show me the tendies.</i>

42:14.076 --> 42:15.327
I got 'em right here.

42:15.327 --> 42:18.705
Show me the tendies. I just gotta...
I just gotta dip.

42:18.705 --> 42:20.499
I just gotta... I just gotta dip.

42:29.424 --> 42:31.051
11 fucking million dollars?

42:31.051 --> 42:32.010
<i>What the fuck!</i>

42:32.010 --> 42:34.763
- Oh, language. The baby's here.
- <i>What are you gonna do?</i>

42:34.763 --> 42:37.057
Get a Ferrari? A Lambo?

42:37.057 --> 42:38.809
Caroline, you're gonna ask for
a big diamond, right?

42:38.809 --> 42:40.185
I have a diamond.

42:40.185 --> 42:42.646
<i>Keith, you get a fucking diamond!
If I were you, I'd look like</i>

42:42.646 --> 42:45.232
- <i>DJ Khaled right now.</i>
- Kev! It's not real.

42:45.232 --> 42:46.859
I mean, it's real, but it's just paper.

42:46.859 --> 42:49.945
Just on paper! You're gonna sell, right?

42:49.945 --> 42:51.238
- No!
- Maybe.

42:51.780 --> 42:53.532
I mean, I don't know.

42:54.575 --> 42:57.995
- We... we haven't talked about it.
- <i>What the fuck is wrong with you?</i>

42:57.995 --> 43:01.248
I'm riding Mom's bike every day
to Dorchester to drop off cheeseburgers

43:01.248 --> 43:02.708
because you won't let me use
your fucking car.

43:02.708 --> 43:04.877
And you're mister "I won't sell
and take millions of dollars."

43:04.877 --> 43:07.212
And, well, what you do with your life
is your choice.

43:07.212 --> 43:10.132
<i>You think I wanted to get laid off
from Dick's during a global pandemic?</i>

43:10.132 --> 43:13.343
I love those sneakers, man.
I loved that store. I love Dick's.

43:13.343 --> 43:16.430
- <i>Mom's bike doesn't even have gears.</i>
- We don't know if it's reached the top.

43:16.430 --> 43:19.349
The stock jumped like 23% yesterday.

43:19.349 --> 43:21.226
- Double from Friday's close.
- But he's right.

43:21.226 --> 43:23.604
I mean, 11 million dollars
is a lot of fucking dough.

43:23.604 --> 43:24.688
- Thank you!
- <i>Okay, yes,</i>

43:24.688 --> 43:27.983
<i>but since Ryan Cohen
joined the board, the...</i>

43:27.983 --> 43:29.318
This fucking guy.

43:29.318 --> 43:31.653
...got a 2 billion market cap.
I mean, could it go pff? Yeah.

43:31.653 --> 43:34.698
But that's not what I'm seeing.
That's not what I'm seeing, Kev.

43:35.782 --> 43:37.534
Kev? You there?

43:40.162 --> 43:41.288
Did he hang up?

43:41.997 --> 43:43.332
Yeah.

43:53.842 --> 43:55.719
Fuck, I think hold.

43:59.097 --> 44:00.057
Girl, you gotta sell.

44:00.057 --> 44:01.725
I'm not selling.

44:01.725 --> 44:02.935
How much are you up?

44:02.935 --> 44:05.562
58,000 and some change.

44:07.481 --> 44:09.816
Baby girl, what the fuck?

44:09.816 --> 44:11.944
You need to get out while you can.

44:11.944 --> 44:14.613
- Don't be an idiot.
- You remember red headband guy.

44:14.613 --> 44:18.116
He's worth 11 million dollars.
And he's not selling.

44:18.116 --> 44:20.160
- No fucking way.
- Yes fucking way.

44:20.160 --> 44:22.788
This is what I'm telling you.
Diamond hands.

44:23.956 --> 44:27.501
Diamond hands. You hold the line
no matter what the market does.

44:27.501 --> 44:28.919
No matter what Wall Street says.

44:28.919 --> 44:30.796
What happens
when everyone else sells first

44:30.796 --> 44:33.715
and before you get out
you've lost all your money?

44:33.715 --> 44:35.467
Are there any volunteers?

44:35.467 --> 44:37.344
- I'm...
- Anyone?

44:37.344 --> 44:39.555
- We're gonna hold the line.
- C'mon.

44:39.555 --> 44:41.682
- Someone has to go first.
- Okay, yeah. I'll do it.

44:47.062 --> 44:48.605
Here we go everyone.

44:48.605 --> 44:51.608
The first Covid vaccine
at Pittsburgh Presbyterian.

44:53.151 --> 44:54.528
Fuck! Fuck!

44:54.528 --> 44:58.532
<i>Fuck! Guys, we need your help.
What should we do?</i>

44:59.783 --> 45:03.620
So listen, my girl bought in under 20
and now it is over 60.

45:03.620 --> 45:05.539
So like, should she sell?

45:05.539 --> 45:07.833
On the one hand, she has principles.

45:08.876 --> 45:12.254
On the other, she has 100k
in student debt. So...

45:12.254 --> 45:15.007
One way you could think
about the comparison between

45:15.007 --> 45:17.634
Marxism and Utilitarian tradition

45:17.634 --> 45:21.346
is that they both have a micro story
and a macro story.

45:21.346 --> 45:23.724
When you think of Utilitarian tradition...

45:23.724 --> 45:28.145
The only thing that would convince her
to sell is if Roaring Kitty sold.

45:29.354 --> 45:31.773
So... Where my pussy at?

45:31.773 --> 45:34.860
You have the micro story
for the Pareto principle

45:34.860 --> 45:37.613
for how each individual action will go.

45:38.447 --> 45:41.825
- But you also have a macro story.
<i>- Where my pussy at? Where my pussy at?</i>

45:41.825 --> 45:43.202
<i>Where my pussy at?!</i>

45:43.202 --> 45:47.247
- Sorry.
<i>- Where my pussy aaaaatttt?!</i>

45:47.247 --> 45:48.790
I'm so sorry.

45:48.790 --> 45:52.169
Hey, hey, where my pussy at? Ha!

45:52.169 --> 45:55.047
- Where is my pussy at?
- It's not in here.

46:15.984 --> 46:17.653
Whoa,

46:18.403 --> 46:20.280
wait, listen, hold on.

46:21.657 --> 46:25.327
"Future generations will look back
and say 'Good men stood here,

46:25.327 --> 46:28.038
good men fought, and died
on this ground...

46:28.038 --> 46:32.709
as they point to a TradingView daily chart
of GME zoomed in on January.'

46:33.377 --> 46:35.045
<i>Since the spawn of the stonkmarket,</i>

46:35.045 --> 46:37.673

46:37.673 --> 46:42.261
"Eternal enemies, forever forced and
fated to combat: lions and hyenas."

46:42.261 --> 46:46.056
<i>"These lions</i>...
<i>these Wall Street hedge funds have it all.</i>

46:46.056 --> 46:47.307
<i>Billions of dollars,</i>

46:47.307 --> 46:52.187
bailouts for reckless trades,
these dirty fucking criminal bastards."

46:52.187 --> 46:56.942
Yup, these fucking motherfuckers.

46:56.942 --> 46:58.527
<i>"And then there's us.</i>

46:58.527 --> 47:03.198
<i>The working man, the average Joe.
What do we have?</i>

47:03.782 --> 47:06.577
<i>What the fuck do we have?</i>

47:06.577 --> 47:08.662
<i>They literally call us 'dumb money.'"</i>

47:08.662 --> 47:10.497
<i>"These lions, these hedge fund guys,</i>

47:10.497 --> 47:12.499

47:12.499 --> 47:14.126
<i>The top 1% of the 1%.</i>

<i>They have massive bank accounts,

47:17.796 --> 47:20.174
What the fuck is that?
That sounds delicious.

47:20.174 --> 47:22.551
"With truffle shavings for lunch."
That's fuck!

47:22.551 --> 47:24.428
<i>"They frequent the finest strip clubs.</i>

47:24.428 --> 47:26.597
<i>They have blow and escorts

47:26.597 --> 47:28.515
Why do we hate these guys?

47:28.515 --> 47:30.559
"Then you know what
they will tell these escorts?"

47:30.559 --> 47:32.728
- What's an escort?
- Stop listening!

47:32.728 --> 47:37.024
"When the smoking hot blonde asks them,
'Like, how do you have so much money?'"

47:37.941 --> 47:42.779
"You know what they say? They say
'Ha, dumb money, babe. Dumb money.'"

47:44.990 --> 47:46.700
Something's burning.

47:47.826 --> 47:50.287
Oh... damn it.

47:50.287 --> 47:52.122
- Shit!
- You said "shit".

48:00.964 --> 48:05.052
<i>"Last, the GME trade is about

48:22.778 --> 48:24.029
<i>We fucking coming for you.</i>

48:24.029 --> 48:26.740
That is some nerdy shit, man.

48:27.407 --> 48:30.077
My brother is a fucking nerd.

48:36.416 --> 48:38.460
Fuck!

48:44.132 --> 48:46.802
Counting down from 5 and then
I'm coming back in there.

48:46.802 --> 48:48.887
I don't think you want that.

48:50.514 --> 48:51.390
5.

48:52.015 --> 48:53.767
- 4.
- 3.

48:53.767 --> 48:55.477
2.

48:56.311 --> 48:57.604
Thank you.

48:57.604 --> 48:59.439
- How was your day?
- Long.

48:59.439 --> 49:04.027
It's so hard to keep them focused
on Zoom school. They're just not into it.

49:04.903 --> 49:06.530
How was your day?

49:06.530 --> 49:07.698
Good.

49:09.992 --> 49:12.452
You're not worried
about the short squeeze thing?

49:12.452 --> 49:14.538
The dam'll break next week.

49:14.538 --> 49:16.999
A few of them will decide it's gone
high enough, they'll cash out,

49:16.999 --> 49:20.210
the rest will follow,
whole thing will come crashing down.

49:20.210 --> 49:23.380
I can't think of the last short squeeze
that actually worked.

49:24.339 --> 49:25.674
Ackman and Herbalife.

49:26.258 --> 49:28.260
Before that... Piggly Wiggly?

49:28.260 --> 49:29.595
Piggly Wiggly.

49:29.595 --> 49:34.266
Yeah. 1923, a bear cartel was shorting
the Piggly Wiggly grocery store.

49:34.266 --> 49:39.313
The founder, he takes out a loan for
what would be $150 million today.

49:39.313 --> 49:41.773
He buys back almost all the stock,
like 99% of the stock.

49:41.773 --> 49:44.109
The price of the stock goes up 50%.

49:44.109 --> 49:46.361
- How much is GameStop up?
- Then, the exchange,

49:46.361 --> 49:48.238
they halt trading on the stock

49:48.238 --> 49:51.074
so the short sellers
can cover their positions.

49:51.074 --> 49:52.743
Is that legal?

49:52.743 --> 49:55.495
The founder had to declare bankruptcy. So...

49:56.371 --> 49:57.873
it was all fine in the end.

49:57.873 --> 50:00.417
And you knew all that or you looked it up?

50:01.710 --> 50:03.670
Every fund manager knows that story.

50:07.758 --> 50:09.134
You looked it up.

50:10.969 --> 50:12.846
Double checked some numbers maybe.

50:22.231 --> 50:25.275
<i>Oh, do you see what's going on at GME?</i>

50:25.275 --> 50:27.319
<i>- There's more of these idiots.
- A lot more.</i>

<i>They won't hold much longer.</i>

50:28.612 --> 50:31.365
<i>Oh, Gabe, honey, they're holding.</i>

50:31.365 --> 50:33.450
It just crossed a hundred.

50:35.827 --> 50:37.329
Gabe?

50:37.329 --> 50:38.830
Where are you?

50:43.252 --> 50:45.254
You should probably dial in.

50:45.254 --> 50:46.880
Yeah, be on in one sec.

50:46.880 --> 50:49.591
<i>GameStop, extraordinary volatility today</i>.

50:49.591 --> 50:51.844

51:04.731 --> 51:07.067
<i>...now we're gonna talk about GameStop.

51:07.067 --> 51:10.195

51:16.368 --> 51:18.662
- Holy shit!
<i>- You look at the chart for the month.</i>

51:18.662 --> 51:21.290

- Everything okay?

51:23.584 --> 51:26.545
Holy fucking shit!

51:26.545 --> 51:30.215
<i>...if you go short in some of these
elaborate options trades</i>,

51:30.215 --> 51:32.426
<i>you can lose money to infinity.</i>

51:32.426 --> 51:36.096
<i>GameStop now at 123 and change,
another record high.</i>

51:36.096 --> 51:38.056
- Holy fucking shit!
- <i>Completely disconnected...</i>

51:38.056 --> 51:39.391
<i>from the fundamentals.</i>

51:39.391 --> 51:42.477
<i>And this is very much being driven
by retail investors.</i>

51:42.477 --> 51:45.522
<i>- Many of them trading on Robinhood.
- When the music stops, somebody...</i>

51:45.522 --> 51:48.859
<i>-is gonna be left without a seat.
- This for casino money only.</i>

51:48.859 --> 51:50.903
<i>They're literally putting the game
in GameStop.</i>

51:50.903 --> 51:52.946
<i>...is the craziest I think I've ever seen.</i>

51:52.946 --> 51:56.783
<i>True investors never heard of Reddit
a few years ago.</i>

51:56.783 --> 51:58.660
<i>But for that to drive a short squeeze...</i>

51:58.660 --> 52:00.996
<i>It is Wall Street Bets.
It's worth going to the site</i>

52:00.996 --> 52:02.873
<i>because it is incredibly compelling.</i>

52:02.873 --> 52:05.709
<i>You may think it's froth,
but they are using arguments</i>

52:05.709 --> 52:07.753
<i>that they think hold up under scrutiny.</i>

52:07.753 --> 52:10.255
<i>- I just like the stock!
- I can't look.</i>

52:10.255 --> 52:12.466
- I can't look. I can't look.
- It's up another 4%.

52:12.466 --> 52:13.884
I'm gonna have a fucking heart attack.

52:13.884 --> 52:15.511
- Should we sell?
- And betray your boyfriend?

52:15.511 --> 52:16.720
Absolutely not. No.

52:16.720 --> 52:18.722
- <i>The stock is up 581%.</i>
- Maybe.

52:18.722 --> 52:20.891
<i>...they are being very specific:</i>

52:20.891 --> 52:22.184
<i>- To break the shorts.
- Yes.</i>

52:22.184 --> 52:23.977
<i>I mean, what's going on
in GameStop right now</i>

52:23.977 --> 52:26.146
<i>conceivably could take
a couple of firms out.</i>

52:26.146 --> 52:28.982
<i>Hedge funds if they were
stupid enough to be short.</i>

52:28.982 --> 52:31.026
Babe, how much did we make today?

52:32.486 --> 52:33.362
5 million.

52:33.946 --> 52:34.905
And yesterday?

52:35.531 --> 52:36.615
4 million.

52:39.159 --> 52:39.993
Babe...

52:40.702 --> 52:41.745
Yeah?

52:42.704 --> 52:45.415
We're, like, really fucking rich.

52:52.089 --> 52:53.841
How much did we lose today?

52:56.385 --> 52:57.261
A billion.

52:59.888 --> 53:00.806
And yesterday?

53:02.432 --> 53:03.433
A billion.

53:07.855 --> 53:09.481
<i>Some news to bring you right now is that</i>

53:09.481 --> 53:11.108
<i>Melvin Capital Management,</i>

53:11.108 --> 53:15.237
<i>this is the hedge fund
that had shorted this company,</i>

53:15.237 --> 53:20.909
<i>that had effectively been attacked
by an army of investors trying to push up</i>

53:20.909 --> 53:23.745
<i>and press up the stock of GameStop.</i>

53:23.745 --> 53:26.331
<i>They've taken a rather huge loss...</i>

53:26.331 --> 53:29.251
Sorry, if you could just
put your head up for a sec?

53:29.918 --> 53:30.836
Thanks.

53:31.336 --> 53:32.754
How long've you been down here?

53:33.255 --> 53:34.089
A few months.

53:35.549 --> 53:36.884
You like the weather?

53:39.052 --> 53:42.514
Heat is nice. The humidity not as much.

53:42.514 --> 53:43.765
I can see that.

53:45.601 --> 53:47.936
All right, I think you're good to go.

54:13.629 --> 54:15.547
- Hey!
<i>- Hey, man.</i>

54:15.547 --> 54:17.382
- Hi.
- <i>It's good to connect.</i>

54:17.382 --> 54:18.592
You too. Great to be here.

54:18.592 --> 54:19.760
- Excited.
<i>- I'm glad you are.</i>

54:19.760 --> 54:21.261
<i>Listen, I want to get right to it.</i>

54:21.261 --> 54:24.431
<i>From what I'm hearing,
you guys are bankrupt.</i>

54:26.183 --> 54:27.684
No! What? No.

54:27.684 --> 54:30.771
<i>'Cause the word on the street is
that you're drowning.</i>

54:30.771 --> 54:33.023
No, that's... That's crazy.

54:33.023 --> 54:35.526
- We're doing great.
- <i>You're on the record with that?</i>

54:36.109 --> 54:36.985
Obviously.

54:36.985 --> 54:40.239
<i>All right man. Well, then, we're gonna
get the live feed up right now,</i>

54:40.239 --> 54:42.616
<i>and then we're gonna get to you
right after this next advertising break.</i>

54:42.616 --> 54:44.326
Perfect, great. Yes, can't wait.

54:49.081 --> 54:51.083
<i>All right, one more spot
and then you're gonna be up.</i>

54:51.083 --> 54:54.169
<i>I really do think this is the right time
for you to communicate.</i>

54:54.169 --> 54:56.129
- Great, yes. Agreed.
- <i>Great. We're gonna do it.</i>

54:56.129 --> 54:58.757
<i>Address it all head on.
It's gonna be good</i>.

55:00.843 --> 55:03.011
- No.
- <i>What? Gabe, we're on in 10 seconds.</i>

55:03.011 --> 55:04.304
I can't do this. I'm sorry.

55:04.304 --> 55:05.264
<i>Gabe, seriously.</i>

55:05.264 --> 55:06.974
- Bye, I'm terribly sorry.
<i>- Seriously, c'mon.</i>

55:06.974 --> 55:08.851
- Good to see you. The pleasure's here.
- <i>We're going on right now.</i>

55:15.566 --> 55:16.400
Babe,

55:17.568 --> 55:18.735
what's the damage?

55:51.059 --> 55:52.352
Let me guess, you need cash.

55:52.352 --> 55:54.396
<i>Didn't call Ken first, did you?</i>

55:54.396 --> 55:56.064
He had Phillips reach out.

55:56.565 --> 55:57.941
<i>How much did he offer?</i>

55:59.443 --> 56:00.903
I haven't called him back yet.

56:00.903 --> 56:02.321
Well, how much do you need?

56:02.321 --> 56:04.781
You know what? Don't answer that.
The number doesn't matter.

56:04.781 --> 56:06.366
Whatever it is, I'd love to buy in.

56:06.366 --> 56:08.452
<i>Tell Ken to fill in the rest.</i>

56:08.452 --> 56:09.661
Prick.

56:15.709 --> 56:16.752
- <i>Hey, Ken.</i>
- Hey.

56:16.752 --> 56:19.880
<i>Hi... So, I might need...</i>

56:22.633 --> 56:23.634
<i>A new investor.</i>

56:23.634 --> 56:24.927
Consider it done.

56:24.927 --> 56:26.929
<i>Just keep moving forward.</i>

56:26.929 --> 56:29.556
<i>Don't think about
what Grandpa Melvin used to say.</i>

56:29.556 --> 56:30.891
Prick.

56:32.768 --> 56:34.728
- Thank you.
- <i>Both Citadel</i>

56:34.728 --> 56:38.440
- <i>and Point72 have infused</i>
- Poor guy.

56:38.440 --> 56:41.944
<i>$3 billion into Melvin Capital</i>

56:41.944 --> 56:44.821
- <i>to try to shore up...</i>
- Another goddamn bailout.

56:44.821 --> 56:46.532
Can you believe this crap?

56:46.532 --> 56:47.741
Nobody bailed me out

56:47.741 --> 56:50.744
when Richard left me alone
with two toddlers, a mortgage,

56:50.744 --> 56:52.037
a shit car that never works.

56:52.037 --> 56:53.789
You can say "shit" but we can't?

56:53.789 --> 56:55.832
It's just so damn unfair and you know it.

56:55.832 --> 56:59.837
All we've done for the last year
is work our asses off helping people,

56:59.837 --> 57:02.548
and all we've gotten is one $600 check.

57:02.548 --> 57:05.592
This idiot effs up just about as bad
as anyone could eff,

57:05.592 --> 57:08.637
and his friends come running in
with $3 billion.

57:08.637 --> 57:10.889
That's why I keep telling you:
you're never gonna win.

57:10.889 --> 57:13.433
Just take the money and do something nice.
Pay off your mortgage.

57:13.433 --> 57:15.018
Get that one braces.

57:15.602 --> 57:17.104
Look who's still holding.

57:18.564 --> 57:20.566
If he's in, I'm in.

57:20.566 --> 57:22.526
Yeah, he's still gonna need braces.

57:22.526 --> 57:23.610
Your teeth are perfect.

57:23.610 --> 57:25.821
So what? The stock's up $150.

57:25.821 --> 57:27.739
- How much higher is it gonna go?
- We control the price now.

57:27.739 --> 57:30.576
Not Wall Street.
And no one on there is selling.

57:30.576 --> 57:31.702
Shoes.

57:31.702 --> 57:33.328
You're all so delusional.

57:33.328 --> 57:36.331
Maybe. But look at what we managed to do
with these hedge funds.

57:36.331 --> 57:37.958
If we keep driving up the price,

57:37.958 --> 57:41.128
maybe we'll scare more of these guys
into closing out their shorts,

57:41.128 --> 57:43.213
and then all of that bailout money...

57:43.213 --> 57:44.631
- Wait...
- becomes ours.

57:44.631 --> 57:45.549
your screen name...

57:46.341 --> 57:47.885
is Stonkmom?

57:52.306 --> 57:53.307
- Hey!
- Help your mother.

57:53.307 --> 57:55.809
- Why me and not Keith?
- Just shut up and do it, okay?

57:55.809 --> 57:58.020
- Kev, take the potatoes.
- 'Cause you're rich now?

57:58.020 --> 58:00.105
Mr. 23 million on paper but I won't sell.

58:00.105 --> 58:02.357
- Kevin.
- Loser says what?

58:03.358 --> 58:05.819
- What?
- Kevin, let Keith tell them.

58:09.031 --> 58:09.907
Tell us what?

58:11.533 --> 58:17.372
Oh... I was waiting to tell you in person.
But the stock we bet on, GameStop is up.

58:17.372 --> 58:18.540
Ah, good.

58:19.666 --> 58:22.127
- How much up?
- He's up 23 million, Pop.

58:22.711 --> 58:23.712
You're an asshole.

58:23.712 --> 58:26.256
- Don't kid us.
- It's real.

58:26.256 --> 58:28.926
Yeah, it's real.
And he's refusing to sell.

58:30.802 --> 58:31.845
What is going on?

58:32.888 --> 58:34.223
- You're pulling our leg.
- No.

58:34.223 --> 58:36.141
Your son's a huge Internet celebrity now.

58:36.141 --> 58:38.977
Millions of people including "Stonkmom"
thinks he's some like,

58:38.977 --> 58:41.021
- I don't know, investment genius.
- No, he is a genius.

58:41.021 --> 58:42.356
No, he's not.

58:42.356 --> 58:44.107
You're up 23 million?

58:45.108 --> 58:46.527
And you're not selling.

58:48.153 --> 58:49.488
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.

58:49.488 --> 58:50.989
What the fuck is wrong with you?

58:50.989 --> 58:53.325
Do you even know
how much $23 million is?

58:53.325 --> 58:55.619
And you're just gonna let it ride?
What's the matter with you?

58:55.619 --> 58:57.829
- I know what I'm doing, Dad.
- But why aren't you selling?

58:57.829 --> 58:59.706
What, wait! Is this illegal?
Are you in trouble?

58:59.706 --> 59:01.124
No. No, he's not in trouble.

59:01.124 --> 59:02.709
- It's totally legal.
- Yeah, he's posting

59:02.709 --> 59:03.627
his balance sheet on the Internet.

59:03.627 --> 59:04.962
- What?
- Hedge fund managers,

59:04.962 --> 59:07.422
they go on CNBC all the time
to pump up the stock.

59:07.422 --> 59:09.883
All I do is post my balance sheet
on Wall Street Bets

59:09.883 --> 59:13.136
- after market close.
- You post your balance sheet?

59:13.136 --> 59:14.304
Yeah, the same idiot

59:14.304 --> 59:17.099
who left a fresh pair of Nikes out on
the bleachers for just anyone to take.

59:17.099 --> 59:18.267
So you admit they were stolen!

59:18.267 --> 59:19.893
- We gotta talk about this.
- I admit you're a fuckin' moron.

59:19.893 --> 59:21.436
- Least I won the race.
- What's the point of winning the race

59:21.436 --> 59:22.896
if you let some dipshit steal the prize?

59:22.896 --> 59:24.231
You would've broke a four
if you had the Zooms on.

59:24.231 --> 59:25.732
A four minute mile
isn't everything, Kevin.

59:25.732 --> 59:27.609
Maybe we should get in touch
with Briggsy.

59:27.609 --> 59:29.027
You know, he works in finance.

59:29.027 --> 59:30.571
- Yes.
- You think Briggsy knows

59:30.571 --> 59:31.738
more about this than Keith does?

59:31.738 --> 59:33.866
Well, can you talk about why
you're putting your stocks

59:33.866 --> 59:35.534
- in the Wall Street Journal?
- Wall Street Bets.

59:35.534 --> 59:37.619
What if someone tries to rob you?
Kidnap the baby?

59:37.619 --> 59:38.954
No one's gonna kidnap the baby.

59:38.954 --> 59:40.831
- Nobody wants that baby, Mom.
- I'm just saying,

59:40.831 --> 59:42.124
that if we're gonna talk to somebody,

59:42.124 --> 59:43.834
- you need to talk to Briggsy.
- Yes, honey.

59:43.834 --> 59:45.419
- This is the point...
- Enough!

59:46.503 --> 59:48.088
You guys, Keith has literally

59:48.088 --> 59:50.382
poured his heart and his soul
into this for the past year.

59:50.382 --> 59:51.758
He knows what he's doing.

59:57.514 --> 01:00:00.017
I know it's been a tough time, Elaine.

01:00:07.941 --> 01:00:09.026
You should still sell.

01:00:11.445 --> 01:00:12.613
Think you should sell.

01:00:16.533 --> 01:00:18.744
And just fuck the principle
of the whole thing?

01:00:18.744 --> 01:00:20.579
I don't like it any more than you do.

01:00:36.053 --> 01:00:37.513
You really don't think
that he's fucking selling?

01:00:37.513 --> 01:00:38.430
No!

01:00:38.931 --> 01:00:39.765
Ladies.

01:00:41.308 --> 01:00:42.142
Masks.

01:00:45.687 --> 01:00:48.982
Kids are with their father for a few days.
So, I'm going to Florida.

01:00:48.982 --> 01:00:51.818
You finally fucking sold.
Halle­fuckin-lujah.

01:00:51.818 --> 01:00:53.946
No, I'm putting it on my Visa.

01:00:53.946 --> 01:00:55.030
You shitting me?

01:00:55.030 --> 01:00:57.199
You're worth hundreds of thousands
of dollars in stock,

01:00:57.199 --> 01:00:58.825
and you're amassing credit card debt.

01:00:58.825 --> 01:01:00.827
You really are out of your mind.

01:01:00.827 --> 01:01:04.831
No, babe, I'm all in. Diamond hand.

01:01:04.831 --> 01:01:06.917
Did you know that Gabe Plotkin
gave an interview?

01:01:06.917 --> 01:01:09.461
He's been getting death threats,
anti-Semitic messages

01:01:09.461 --> 01:01:11.797
- from these WSB guys.
- It was ten comments.

01:01:11.797 --> 01:01:14.132
There's always bad apples.
And the moderators deleted it right away.

01:01:14.132 --> 01:01:16.593
You're just gonna ride this thing
till zero?

01:01:16.593 --> 01:01:19.012
No. I'm buying call options.

01:01:19.012 --> 01:01:22.558
- That could go to 600 by tomorrow.
- Your kid is never getting braces.

01:01:30.566 --> 01:01:32.693
<i>There's 8 million people in there
and they're all holding.</i>

01:01:32.693 --> 01:01:34.236
<i>It's only going to go up.</i>

01:01:34.236 --> 01:01:35.779
It's a joke, Marcos.

01:01:35.779 --> 01:01:37.823
But you're treating it
like it's real life.

01:01:38.699 --> 01:01:39.533
Pops.

01:01:41.743 --> 01:01:42.578
Look.

01:01:43.620 --> 01:01:44.538
This is real.

01:01:45.080 --> 01:01:46.039
- Hold it. Look.
- Hey.

01:01:46.039 --> 01:01:46.999
Aw, man.

01:01:48.667 --> 01:01:50.377
8 million people is real.

01:01:50.377 --> 01:01:52.045
H-O-D-L.

01:01:52.754 --> 01:01:56.216
8 million don't even know
how to spell "hold."

01:01:56.216 --> 01:01:57.134
It's a joke.

01:01:57.134 --> 01:01:58.468
A corny joke.

01:01:58.468 --> 01:01:59.469
It's not funny.

01:02:03.682 --> 01:02:04.516
Mom,

01:02:05.851 --> 01:02:06.894
look.

01:02:06.894 --> 01:02:09.521
I got $175,000 in stock right now.

01:02:09.521 --> 01:02:10.689
What?

01:02:10.689 --> 01:02:13.483
Like serious money, like I could get you
a house and get you up out of here,

01:02:13.483 --> 01:02:14.735
kind of money.

01:02:14.735 --> 01:02:15.903
Baby.

01:02:15.903 --> 01:02:18.322
Where did you get the money to buy this?

01:02:19.489 --> 01:02:22.284
I bought call options, for cheap.

01:02:22.284 --> 01:02:23.243
And they hit.

01:02:24.036 --> 01:02:25.370
So now you're gonna sell?

01:02:25.370 --> 01:02:26.788
Nah. No, I buy more.

01:02:27.623 --> 01:02:29.458
At this price!?

01:02:29.458 --> 01:02:31.502
When they hit,
I'm gonna buy you a mansion.

01:02:31.502 --> 01:02:32.586
It's gonna be crazy.

01:02:32.586 --> 01:02:35.380
My son, I don't need a mansion.

01:02:39.051 --> 01:02:40.219
Be careful.

01:02:40.719 --> 01:02:43.096
Don't get addicted to this, my son.

01:02:43.096 --> 01:02:44.806
This can be like a drug.

01:02:50.854 --> 01:02:55.609
<i>Some breaking news right now
on what has turned into the soap opera</i>

01:02:55.609 --> 01:02:59.947
<i>and saga of the markets right now.
And that is the story of GameStop.</i>

01:02:59.947 --> 01:03:02.741
<i>A month ago today, it was trading
at about 20 bucks per share.</i>

01:03:02.741 --> 01:03:04.910
<i>Two days ago, it was under $80.</i>

01:03:04.910 --> 01:03:08.330
<i>Today, nearly $350 a share.</i>

01:03:08.330 --> 01:03:12.376

<i>the French Revolution of finance.</i>

01:03:18.882 --> 01:03:20.300
<i>There is a rebellion aspect to it.</i>

01:03:20.300 --> 01:03:22.386
<i>There is
an anti-establishment aspect to it.</i>

01:03:22.386 --> 01:03:23.762
<i>I don't know if Wall Street's ever seen it</i>

01:03:23.762 --> 01:03:24.847
<i>-like this before.
- No.</i>

01:03:24.847 --> 01:03:26.181
<i>-We never have.
- It's generational.</i>

01:03:26.181 --> 01:03:27.891
<i>It's like generational injustices.</i>

01:03:27.891 --> 01:03:31.353
<i>This is like,
little poor guys vs. rich guys.</i>

01:03:31.353 --> 01:03:34.231
<i>And poor guys are winning right now</i>.

01:03:34.231 --> 01:03:36.775
<i>Fucking hold! If you're new here
and you're trying to make a profit,</i>

01:03:36.775 --> 01:03:38.610
<i>-fuck off!
- Stop what you're doing, and listen up.</i>

01:03:38.610 --> 01:03:41.029
<i>I own GameStop on Robinhood
and I am not selling.</i>

01:03:41.029 --> 01:03:44.741
<i>Hold. All you need to do is hold.
Keep fucking holding.</i>

01:03:44.741 --> 01:03:48.453
<i>Soon the Tendieman comes to send

01:03:48.453 --> 01:03:51.707

01:03:51.707 --> 01:03:53.584
<i>for all this GameStop stuff.</i>

01:03:53.584 --> 01:03:59.965
<i>Just a pure specimen.
A God-like undefeatable creature.</i>

01:03:59.965 --> 01:04:03.594
<i>This is what excellence looks like.</i>

01:04:03.594 --> 01:04:05.929

<i>47 million.</i>

01:04:13.228 --> 01:04:14.938
<i>What the fuck is happening?</i>

01:04:15.689 --> 01:04:17.107
What the fuck?

01:04:19.234 --> 01:04:20.652
Hey, did you try a different browser?

01:04:20.652 --> 01:04:22.988
- I plugged the browser.
- Shit, we're fucked.

01:04:24.156 --> 01:04:25.324
Bro, what the fuck?

01:04:25.324 --> 01:04:27.451
- What the fuck, dude?
- I told you this shit is rigged.

01:04:28.869 --> 01:04:29.995
What the fuck is going on?

01:04:32.539 --> 01:04:33.749
I can't get it to load.

01:04:40.214 --> 01:04:41.131
Fuck!

01:04:45.427 --> 01:04:46.261
What?

01:04:49.431 --> 01:04:51.225
They shut down Wall Street Bets.

01:04:51.725 --> 01:04:54.728
- What?
-"Hateful and discriminatory content."

01:04:54.728 --> 01:04:56.438
That stuff has always been on there.

01:05:01.944 --> 01:05:03.278
That's weird.

01:05:03.278 --> 01:05:04.279
No?

01:05:05.322 --> 01:05:08.659
I mean, it's like they're trying
to stop people from talking to each other.

01:05:15.999 --> 01:05:17.167
Babe, are you gonna get that?

01:05:17.167 --> 01:05:18.085
Yes.

01:05:21.129 --> 01:05:21.964
Hello?

01:05:23.632 --> 01:05:26.593
Ah, yes, I am...

01:05:27.094 --> 01:05:30.347
I am the Roaring Kitty
and Deep F-ing Value.

01:05:32.140 --> 01:05:35.561
Ah no, but nobody ever asked me.

01:05:37.646 --> 01:05:38.981
Oh, okay.

01:05:38.981 --> 01:05:41.775
Sir, I just want to say
how grateful I am for this job

01:05:41.775 --> 01:05:43.694
and how much it means
to me and my family.

01:05:43.694 --> 01:05:46.113
I would never let a hobby jeopardize...

01:05:47.823 --> 01:05:49.783
Okay. I understand.

01:05:55.747 --> 01:05:58.208
- Yeah?
- It's MassMutual. They're...

01:05:58.208 --> 01:06:01.628
getting calls from reporters "concerned"
about my "outside activities."

01:06:01.628 --> 01:06:03.505
Was all this against the rules?

01:06:03.505 --> 01:06:06.425
I wasn't...? Maybe now it is...

01:06:06.425 --> 01:06:07.342
Okay.

01:06:10.387 --> 01:06:11.930
Well, what was that call?

01:06:13.557 --> 01:06:15.017
- Keith?
- It's okay.

01:06:15.017 --> 01:06:16.226
What, are you going to lose your job?

01:06:16.226 --> 01:06:17.144
- What?
- It's fine.

01:06:18.270 --> 01:06:20.105
- They gave me a choice.
- Between what?

01:06:20.105 --> 01:06:21.899
Between your job and Roaring Kitty?

01:06:23.901 --> 01:06:25.736
Resign or I'm fired.

01:06:25.736 --> 01:06:26.695
That's what he just said?

01:06:28.071 --> 01:06:28.906
I got it.

01:06:31.158 --> 01:06:32.534
<i>Fuck it, Wall Street Bets is down,
I can't see</i>

01:06:32.534 --> 01:06:34.161
<i>- Roaring Kitty's balance sheet.</i>
- Oh fuck.

01:06:34.161 --> 01:06:35.412
I don't know what to do.

01:06:35.913 --> 01:06:36.997
This could be the sell-off.

01:06:36.997 --> 01:06:39.041
I really don't wanna do that.

01:06:39.041 --> 01:06:42.211
Well, me neither.
But you can't let it go to zero.

01:06:43.086 --> 01:06:45.422
It's 150 grand. You need that money.

01:06:45.422 --> 01:06:47.883
And nobody is gonna hold
if they can't see what he's doing.

01:06:50.594 --> 01:06:52.054
Close your eyes and count to three.

01:06:52.763 --> 01:06:53.597
One.

01:06:55.599 --> 01:06:56.517
- Two.
- Two.

01:06:57.726 --> 01:06:58.852
- Three.
- Three.

01:07:03.607 --> 01:07:04.441
Your phone's ringing.

01:07:04.441 --> 01:07:06.652
This is the sound of the world.

01:07:06.652 --> 01:07:08.362
Your phone is ringing!

01:07:08.362 --> 01:07:12.491
Oh, Robinhood. Yeah. It's an app.

01:07:13.075 --> 01:07:14.368
It's on the phone.

01:07:14.368 --> 01:07:16.745
- Yeah, no, your phone is ringing.
- Oh.

01:07:17.788 --> 01:07:20.082
Yes...

01:07:23.043 --> 01:07:24.878
Slow down, Norm, what did you say?

01:07:25.379 --> 01:07:29.800
The NSCC just sent us a file,
they want a deposit of 3 billion

01:07:29.800 --> 01:07:31.510
to clear all the trades coming in.

01:07:32.219 --> 01:07:33.512
Sorry.

01:07:33.512 --> 01:07:34.596
Wait, who?

01:07:34.596 --> 01:07:40.143
They're a subsidiary of the DTCC.
And they're requesting 3 billion.

01:07:40.143 --> 01:07:45.107
Ah... Okay. Sorry, it's a little loud in
here. I thought you just said 3 billion.

01:07:45.607 --> 01:07:46.650
<i>I did!</i>

01:07:47.943 --> 01:07:50.654
- But we don't have 3 billion, Norm.
- That's correct.

01:07:50.654 --> 01:07:53.699
<i>We've only ever raised 2 billion
in the history of the company.</i>

01:07:54.575 --> 01:07:56.535
Holy fuck! What if we don't pay?

01:07:56.535 --> 01:07:57.995
They shut us down.

01:07:58.954 --> 01:08:01.957
The IPO, like, everything... poof.

01:08:01.957 --> 01:08:04.835
Gretchen, Dan and I are going to
jump on a call with Citadel at 9.

01:08:08.672 --> 01:08:11.717
Maybe this would be a good time for me
to chat with Ken Griffin.

01:08:11.717 --> 01:08:14.428
<i>Sure. We'll mention that.</i>

01:08:16.013 --> 01:08:17.305
I can't sleep.

01:08:17.305 --> 01:08:18.348
Me neither.

01:08:18.849 --> 01:08:20.142
I just feel sick!

01:08:21.143 --> 01:08:22.728
We'll buy it back first thing.

01:08:24.563 --> 01:08:25.981
Please shut up.

01:08:40.828 --> 01:08:42.288
What the fuck.

01:08:45.375 --> 01:08:46.502
Oh! What the fuck!

01:08:47.544 --> 01:08:49.630
- What the fuck!
- Okay, let me try.

01:08:50.714 --> 01:08:52.090
Is it frozen?

01:08:57.345 --> 01:08:59.139
They cut off the buy option.

01:08:59.848 --> 01:09:01.390
What?! That's fucking criminal.

01:09:01.390 --> 01:09:02.684
I can't hear you, Baiju!

01:09:02.684 --> 01:09:04.019
<i>What the fuck did you do?</i>

01:09:04.019 --> 01:09:05.770
- Calm down.
- Me calm down?

01:09:05.770 --> 01:09:07.356
You shut down trading on GameStop?

01:09:07.356 --> 01:09:08.524
<i>Not all trading.</i>

01:09:08.524 --> 01:09:09.691
Norm worked it out.

01:09:09.691 --> 01:09:13.237
The DTCC agreed to lower the deposit
to 700 million

01:09:13.237 --> 01:09:15.404
if we shut off buying,
and that's what I did.

01:09:15.404 --> 01:09:17.448
<i>The Depository Trade Commission?</i>

01:09:17.448 --> 01:09:19.701
<i>They're like one degree away
from Ken Griffin.</i>

01:09:19.701 --> 01:09:20.953
One more time, Baiju.

01:09:21.995 --> 01:09:22.912
...butt boys!

01:09:24.915 --> 01:09:27.042
- What?
<i>- It's not going to be okay.</i>

01:09:27.042 --> 01:09:28.292
You need to fix this...

01:09:28.292 --> 01:09:29.920
I know, it's okay.

01:09:30.796 --> 01:09:32.214
I did fix it, Baiju.

01:09:34.424 --> 01:09:37.135
<i>We've been watching shares of
GameStop all day long</i>

01:09:37.135 --> 01:09:40.805
<i>after hitting a staggering high of $483.</i>

01:09:40.805 --> 01:09:43.767
<i>The shares are now down to about 140.</i>

01:09:43.767 --> 01:09:46.728
<i>Now, the best we can tell is
the Robinhood app</i>

01:09:46.728 --> 01:09:51.358
<i>that seems to have triggered what really
has become a panic sell-off in this name.</i>

01:09:51.358 --> 01:09:55.988
<i>And so if you're a retail investor
or a Reddit user and you've held,</i>

01:09:55.988 --> 01:09:59.116
<i>well, you are feeling some serious pain
right now.</i>

01:09:59.950 --> 01:10:01.118
Oh God.

01:10:02.578 --> 01:10:04.997
- Fuck.
<i>- Now the criticism centered on Robinhood</i>

01:10:04.997 --> 01:10:09.334
<i>for abandoning their followers here
in favor of helping those who had shorted</i>

01:10:09.334 --> 01:10:12.337
<i>- all these stocks in the first place.
- I don't particularly like the move</i>

01:10:12.337 --> 01:10:13.255
<i>on Robinhood today.</i>

01:10:13.255 --> 01:10:15.132
<i>I'm talking to people this morning

01:10:15.132 --> 01:10:17.009
<i>"Okay, that is anti-capitalism.</i>

01:10:17.009 --> 01:10:18.510
<i>- You can't do that."</i>
- Fuck you, Robinhood!

01:10:18.510 --> 01:10:23.223
<i>There's been some controversy
about Citadel and some vague accusations</i>

01:10:23.223 --> 01:10:26.393
<i>that somehow Citadel may have been
involved in Robinhood's decision, Wolf,</i>

01:10:26.393 --> 01:10:29.855

01:10:29.855 --> 01:10:30.898

The Tendieman...?

01:10:35.569 --> 01:10:36.486
Come back inside.

01:10:36.486 --> 01:10:38.030
Diamond fucking hands!

01:10:40.199 --> 01:10:42.618
<i>We all know how I feel about him.</i>

01:10:42.618 --> 01:10:44.369
<i>I think he's a rat, a liar.</i>

01:10:44.369 --> 01:10:49.208
<i>Okay, Vlad, you know everybody here
who's watching us hates your guts, right?</i>

01:10:50.209 --> 01:10:53.712
<i>Thank you, Dave, that's... what I hear.</i>

01:10:53.712 --> 01:10:57.633
<i>But I'm a really big fan of your show

01:10:57.633 --> 01:10:59.718
<i>- some of your questions.
- Vlad, can you hear us?</i>

01:10:59.718 --> 01:11:02.763
<i>- Vlad the stock impaler.</i>
- Yes, I'm here... Hi.

01:11:02.763 --> 01:11:04.890
<i>Spill the beans, man,
what happened last week?</i>

01:11:04.890 --> 01:11:07.684
<i>Why couldn't people buy GameStop shares?</i>

01:11:07.684 --> 01:11:09.603
<i>The people demand an answer.</i>

01:11:09.603 --> 01:11:13.148
<i>To give you some background,
I'm chief executive of Robinhood...</i>

01:11:13.148 --> 01:11:14.483
<i>- Robbing executive.
- Yeah, we know that.</i>

01:11:14.483 --> 01:11:16.151
And I just want to say,

01:11:16.151 --> 01:11:18.820
- we had no liquidity problem<i>.
- Well, did something maybe shady</i>

01:11:18.820 --> 01:11:20.656
<i>go down here?
Seems weird that you'd get a sudden</i>

01:11:20.656 --> 01:11:22.783
<i>- 10 billion dollar demand... You know.</i>
- Three, 3 billion...

01:11:22.783 --> 01:11:24.993
<i>- Okay, but 3 billion just suddenly,
- Yeah.</i>

01:11:24.993 --> 01:11:27.079
<i>- out of nowhere and...
- Well, I wouldn't impute</i>

01:11:27.079 --> 01:11:30.207
<i>any shadiness to any of this...</i>

01:11:30.207 --> 01:11:34.920
I don't have the full context as to what
was going on with the NSCC to,

01:11:34.920 --> 01:11:37.965
to make these calculations.

01:11:37.965 --> 01:11:40.425
<i>To what degree are you beholden
to Citadel?</i>

01:11:40.425 --> 01:11:43.679
<i>I mean, like, basically,
if Citadel is unhappy, then what happens?</i>

01:11:43.679 --> 01:11:46.849
<i>- It was a hard temperance.
- Is anyone holding you hostage right now?</i>

01:11:46.849 --> 01:11:48.267
<i>- No.
- There's just</i>

01:11:48.267 --> 01:11:51.562
<i>no rational explanation on
why they would do what they did</i>

01:11:51.562 --> 01:11:54.273
<i>without outside pressure, interference.</i>

01:11:54.273 --> 01:11:56.942
<i>And they basically cratered the stock
on purpose.</i>

01:11:56.942 --> 01:11:59.987
<i>So, I just don't believe
anything that guy says.</i>

01:11:59.987 --> 01:12:02.364
<i>I wanted to take a cold shower
after seeing him say that.</i>

01:12:02.364 --> 01:12:05.033
<i>Robinhood is facing lawsuits,
we know that.</i>

01:12:05.033 --> 01:12:07.411
<i>After halting trade, they are accused</i>

01:12:07.411 --> 01:12:09.580
<i>-of rigging the market.
- When the big guys,</i>

01:12:09.580 --> 01:12:12.833
<i>including one of your main investors
in your company started to lose,</i>

01:12:12.833 --> 01:12:15.502
<i>you shut down the game
to starve the little guy.</i>

01:12:15.502 --> 01:12:18.505
<i>They're stealing from the poor
and giving back to the rich.</i>

01:12:18.505 --> 01:12:21.884
<i>They're robbing from the 'hood! Why?</i>

01:12:21.884 --> 01:12:24.928
<i>-I want to be 100% clear,
- All of you guys deserve to burn in hell.</i>

01:12:24.928 --> 01:12:26.305
<i>- this decision to...
- And go to jail.</i>

01:12:26.305 --> 01:12:27.431
<i>restrict trade was not made
on the direction</i>

01:12:27.431 --> 01:12:28.682
<i>I'm just trying to get my mom
out the 'hood.</i>

01:12:28.682 --> 01:12:31.476
<i>- of Citadel or any market maker.
- What the fuck? Fuck you!</i>

01:12:31.476 --> 01:12:32.895
<i>And your Mama Dukes,
you motherfucking fraud.</i>

01:12:32.895 --> 01:12:33.812
<i>Fuck this guy.</i>

01:12:34.688 --> 01:12:37.191
This guy is just
an obfuscating piece of shit.

01:12:37.191 --> 01:12:38.483
Fucker.

01:12:38.483 --> 01:12:40.819
There's only one man
I wanna hear from right now.

01:12:40.819 --> 01:12:43.447
And Wall Street Bets is down,
so it's crickets.

01:12:43.447 --> 01:12:45.032
It's crickets out here.

01:12:45.908 --> 01:12:47.034
Say it with me.

01:12:47.534 --> 01:12:49.536
- Where my pussy at!
- Where my pussy at!

01:12:50.245 --> 01:12:51.788
- Mr. Gill!
- Mr. Gill!

01:12:52.581 --> 01:12:56.418
- Roaring Kitty, I fucking love you!
- Keith Gill!

01:12:56.418 --> 01:12:58.170
- Keith Gill, please!
- Okay.

01:12:58.170 --> 01:13:01.298
- Please.
- Oh, sorry, this is, like, my house...

01:13:01.298 --> 01:13:02.883
- You want my autograph?
- Yeah.

01:13:03.800 --> 01:13:04.676
You've been served.

01:13:07.763 --> 01:13:10.599
Hey, to the moon, baby! To the moon.

01:13:10.599 --> 01:13:11.808
Holy shit.

01:13:16.730 --> 01:13:20.567
Sorry to interrupt. We need to talk
about the GameStop situation.

01:13:20.567 --> 01:13:21.693
I thought Mecane was handling it.

01:13:21.693 --> 01:13:24.780
So did we. But the committee's
specifically requested you, sir.

01:13:24.780 --> 01:13:26.990
If they want specifics,
they can have Mecane.

01:13:27.699 --> 01:13:29.618
It's not a choice, unfortunately.

01:13:33.830 --> 01:13:35.082
Shitballs.

01:13:37.960 --> 01:13:38.794
Keith?

01:13:40.379 --> 01:13:43.465
- A congressional subpoena.
- I never did anything illegal.

01:13:43.465 --> 01:13:44.925
And I always had disclaimers...

01:13:45.592 --> 01:13:47.219
Why would you have disclaimers
if you weren't worried?

01:13:48.345 --> 01:13:50.764
They're standard practice, Caroline,
everyone has them.

01:13:55.769 --> 01:13:56.603
Babe...

01:14:00.148 --> 01:14:02.693
- the answer is not in your computer.
- Whoa!

01:14:03.318 --> 01:14:07.281
There's a dozen reporters on our lawn!
You have to testify before Congress.

01:14:07.948 --> 01:14:10.701
- The game has changed.
- I know. I hear you.

01:14:10.701 --> 01:14:12.119
I don't think you do.

01:14:17.666 --> 01:14:19.084
Oh, my God. We're...

01:14:20.627 --> 01:14:21.962
We're gonna go to my mother's.

01:14:21.962 --> 01:14:24.131
No, she has terrible Wi-Fi.

01:14:24.131 --> 01:14:26.175
I'm not talking about you.

01:14:26.175 --> 01:14:28.051
I'm talking about me and her.

01:14:28.802 --> 01:14:30.345
You need to figure this out.

01:14:43.525 --> 01:14:45.402
- Where are you going?
- To the track.

01:14:45.402 --> 01:14:47.613
- You were just on the track.
- I'm going again.

01:14:58.248 --> 01:15:00.667
Hi. Can I interest you in
some champagne or a mimosa?

01:15:00.667 --> 01:15:02.961
- Is it free?
- It is when you sit up here.

01:15:02.961 --> 01:15:04.963
Well, there is a last time for everything.

01:15:04.963 --> 01:15:06.465
Oh, you'll be back.

01:15:06.465 --> 01:15:10.719
I had half a million in stocks last week,
but Wall Street cheated.

01:15:11.220 --> 01:15:12.387
Surprise, surprise.

01:15:14.181 --> 01:15:15.432
I could have cashed out.

01:15:16.558 --> 01:15:18.352
I could have paid my mortgage.

01:15:18.352 --> 01:15:20.062
Could have gotten my kid braces.

01:15:20.062 --> 01:15:20.979
Got a new car.

01:15:20.979 --> 01:15:22.689
Honey, I'm gonna get you
something stronger.

01:15:22.689 --> 01:15:24.191
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:15:30.322 --> 01:15:31.448
Meow!

01:15:31.448 --> 01:15:32.574
Kitty!

01:15:32.574 --> 01:15:35.285
You know you can't just eat other people's
food. They do reviews, right?

01:15:35.285 --> 01:15:36.328
Very funny.

01:15:36.328 --> 01:15:37.246
Here.

01:15:37.829 --> 01:15:39.122
What's this?

01:15:39.122 --> 01:15:40.541
Look, they were on sale, all right,

01:15:40.541 --> 01:15:43.627
- before you get all emotional and shit.
- Holy shit, you fucking softy.

01:15:43.627 --> 01:15:45.838
Who put you up to this? Caro? Ma?

01:15:45.838 --> 01:15:48.298
No, Dad called me in tears,
said my big brother needed

01:15:48.298 --> 01:15:50.551
- some moral support.
- Ah, fuck off.

01:15:51.218 --> 01:15:52.761
- I can't.
- C'mon, man. Will you at least try 'em on?

01:15:52.761 --> 01:15:54.012
Please?

01:15:54.012 --> 01:15:56.056
Try 'em. C'mon,
you're the richest man in Brockton,

01:15:56.056 --> 01:15:58.642
- you dress like an asshole.
- I lost 15 million yesterday.

01:15:58.642 --> 01:16:01.603
- And another 15 the day before that.
- You're still the richest man in Brockton,

01:16:01.603 --> 01:16:02.980
like, by far.

01:16:03.647 --> 01:16:07.484
Bro, you got rich dudes
pissing in their pants right now.

01:16:07.484 --> 01:16:10.279
I mean, c'mon, man, how many people
from Brockton High can say that?

01:16:10.279 --> 01:16:11.446
This has gone crazy,

01:16:11.446 --> 01:16:14.283
I got reporters hounding me
outside my house.

01:16:14.283 --> 01:16:16.410
Yeah, man, me too.
They're coming after you.

01:16:17.995 --> 01:16:19.705
You didn't talk to them, did you?

01:16:19.705 --> 01:16:23.041
What do I look like? I said no.
I said give me 50 grand maybe.

01:16:23.041 --> 01:16:24.126
Tell me you're kidding.

01:16:24.126 --> 01:16:26.795
Well, if you give me 20, then maybe
we wouldn't have to deal with this shit.

01:16:26.795 --> 01:16:27.838
The fuck is wrong with you!?

01:16:27.838 --> 01:16:31.258
Kevin, I've just been subpoenaed
by Congress, man.

01:16:31.258 --> 01:16:32.926
I do not have time for your bullshit.

01:16:32.926 --> 01:16:35.470
- Oh, come off it, man!
- Seriously, asshole.

01:16:35.470 --> 01:16:37.431
- Chill! It was a joke!
- Fuck!

01:16:45.355 --> 01:16:46.190
I know.

01:16:47.024 --> 01:16:47.900
Sorry.

01:16:54.990 --> 01:16:57.159
We never used to fight this much.

01:17:00.078 --> 01:17:02.039
- Sara.
- I miss her.

01:17:02.664 --> 01:17:03.540
Me too.

01:17:04.124 --> 01:17:05.542
She kept your ego in check.

01:17:06.210 --> 01:17:08.378
Whole fuckin' world kept my ego in check.

01:17:09.463 --> 01:17:12.090
What the fuck are you gonna tell
Congress, Keith? Huh?

01:17:13.217 --> 01:17:15.260
Beg them not to send me to prison?

01:17:17.513 --> 01:17:18.347
Hey...

01:17:19.097 --> 01:17:23.227
Hey, do you remember back at Stonehill
when they dared me to run that mile naked?

01:17:23.727 --> 01:17:25.437
Yeah, there was a crazy storm that night.

01:17:25.437 --> 01:17:27.147
- You dumb shit.
- Fuck you, man.

01:17:27.147 --> 01:17:29.566
That was dope, man.
I'm a legend over there.

01:17:29.566 --> 01:17:30.817
Everybody remembers that!

01:17:30.817 --> 01:17:31.944
- Okay.
- They do, man.

01:17:31.944 --> 01:17:33.987
You don't think people remember
your 4-minute 3-second mile?

01:17:33.987 --> 01:17:35.948
Oh... what is this, a pep talk?

01:17:35.948 --> 01:17:37.449
Motherfucker, stop hiding.

01:17:37.449 --> 01:17:40.994
Seriously. Okay, stop being all meek
and shit and running away.

01:17:41.828 --> 01:17:44.373
What, you want me to run through
lightning with my dick out?

01:17:44.373 --> 01:17:45.374
Yeah.

01:17:45.374 --> 01:17:47.543
Please, exactly that.

01:17:48.252 --> 01:17:50.546
Run through lightning with your dick out.
Fuck it.

01:17:58.762 --> 01:18:00.222
You didn't go to your mom's?

01:18:02.140 --> 01:18:03.350
You took the car.

01:18:05.102 --> 01:18:07.187
How was the run? Did it clear your head?

01:18:07.980 --> 01:18:09.523
Kev found me, brought me these.

01:18:10.774 --> 01:18:12.025
You guys talked?

01:18:12.526 --> 01:18:15.279
Yup, he told me to run naked.

01:18:15.779 --> 01:18:17.364
- You ran naked?
- No.

01:18:18.031 --> 01:18:21.535
It's a metaphor. He's saying
I gotta take this thing head on.

01:18:22.619 --> 01:18:23.453
Well...

01:18:29.042 --> 01:18:30.627
I'd kinda like to see you run naked.

01:18:34.339 --> 01:18:36.925
By the way, Wall Street Bets is back up.

01:18:38.552 --> 01:18:39.928
The motherfucker held.

01:18:40.679 --> 01:18:45.058
Holy shit! He lost 30 million,
and he still fucking held.

01:18:48.437 --> 01:18:50.147
- Robinhood's back up.
- What?

01:18:50.939 --> 01:18:53.358
- We gotta get back in.
- Where's the stock at right now?

01:18:54.109 --> 01:18:55.110
109.

01:18:55.611 --> 01:18:56.653
Are you sure?

01:18:57.154 --> 01:18:59.907
That's like all of the money
that we made back into the stock.

01:19:03.785 --> 01:19:06.288
Yeah. We can't let them
get away with this.

01:19:08.373 --> 01:19:09.208
Fuck 'em.

01:19:09.791 --> 01:19:11.001
If he's in, I'm in.

01:19:11.877 --> 01:19:13.086
If he's in, I'm in.

01:19:16.590 --> 01:19:17.591
Okay.

01:19:19.259 --> 01:19:20.219
Fuck!

<i>The frenzy continues with retail investors

<i>I grew up in a middle-class family
in Portland, Maine.</i>

01:20:05.639 --> 01:20:07.307
My dad was a grocery store executive.

01:20:07.307 --> 01:20:08.767
Maybe leave that part out.

01:20:10.102 --> 01:20:11.186
The part about my dad?

01:20:11.186 --> 01:20:12.312
The executive part.

01:20:12.312 --> 01:20:13.897
Okay... okay.

01:20:17.234 --> 01:20:21.697
I went to a public high school.
I studied hard and got into Northwestern.

01:20:21.697 --> 01:20:23.782
- Just say "a good college."
- Upon...

01:20:23.782 --> 01:20:25.367
I can't say I went to Northwestern?

01:20:25.367 --> 01:20:27.244
- Too elite.
- Northwestern's too...

01:20:27.911 --> 01:20:28.745
All right.

01:20:32.749 --> 01:20:37.337
Upon graduation, I did not have a job.
Today, I'm married with four children.

01:20:37.337 --> 01:20:39.590
Gabe, where do you plan on
doing your testimony?

01:20:41.967 --> 01:20:44.720
- Here.
- In front of your wine collection?

01:20:46.763 --> 01:20:49.933
I mean, this is... I don't have that big
of a wine collection honestly.

01:20:49.933 --> 01:20:50.976
Yeah, it's huge.

01:20:50.976 --> 01:20:52.895
Digital risks seem to be overblown.

01:20:52.895 --> 01:20:55.397
Two, the negative sentiment is overdone.

01:20:55.397 --> 01:20:59.193
- Three, the value...
- Maybe... here would be nice.

01:21:02.487 --> 01:21:04.489
- Too many windows.
- Too many windows... Oh.

01:21:04.489 --> 01:21:05.657
It's very bright.

01:21:05.657 --> 01:21:08.827
- Yeah, ocean front's not a great idea.
- It's blue.

01:21:08.827 --> 01:21:11.371
Yeah. Okay, I hadn't thought of that. That...

01:21:11.371 --> 01:21:12.956
Yeah, downstairs there's more...

01:21:12.956 --> 01:21:14.208
- there's probably darker rooms.
<i>- What a bandit.</i>

01:21:14.208 --> 01:21:17.294
<i>Most of you know this guy,
who is the Roaring Kitty character,</i>

01:21:17.294 --> 01:21:18.754
- <i>who was really pushing it.</i>
- Holy shit.

01:21:18.754 --> 01:21:20.797
- <i>You know, voicing the information.</i>
- Yo, Riri, our boy's on the news.

01:21:20.797 --> 01:21:22.716
<i>And what's the potentially systemic risk?</i>

01:21:22.716 --> 01:21:25.052
<i>Those relationships in D.C. are strong.</i>

01:21:25.052 --> 01:21:29.181
<i>The guys who run those hedge funds are
the guys who fund presidential campaigns.</i>

01:21:29.181 --> 01:21:31.141
<i>- You know Roaring Kitties don't have
- That's a good point.</i>

01:21:31.141 --> 01:21:32.559
<i>- that kind of influence,
- Gill is now being sued</i>

01:21:32.559 --> 01:21:33.644
<i>- but the hedge fund managers do.
- for securities fraud</i>

01:21:33.644 --> 01:21:35.979
<i>over his alleged role
in the GameStop rally.</i>

01:21:35.979 --> 01:21:38.857
<i>Is Mr. Gill likely to appear,
and if he appears,</i>

01:21:38.857 --> 01:21:43.028
<i>is he likely to talk
if he faces the potential of prosecution?</i>

01:21:43.028 --> 01:21:48.033
Fundamentals are based on three things:
One, digital risks are overblown.

01:21:48.033 --> 01:21:49.952
Two, the negative sentiment is overdone.

01:21:49.952 --> 01:21:51.161
And three...

01:21:54.873 --> 01:21:55.707
Fuck.

01:21:55.707 --> 01:21:57.918
- Ah, c'mon, shut up.
- I know all this.

01:21:59.419 --> 01:22:01.839
You guys, you guys, stop.
Stop, let's keep going.

01:22:01.839 --> 01:22:03.841
- All right, let's go again.
- You're right, this is serious.

01:22:03.841 --> 01:22:05.300
You can go to jail forever.

01:22:05.300 --> 01:22:06.927
- A long time. Long, long time.
- All right. You ready?

01:22:06.927 --> 01:22:08.887
You ready here we go. Back in the game.

01:22:08.887 --> 01:22:11.473
Mr. Gill. Mr. Gill,
may I call you Mr. Gill, sir?

01:22:11.473 --> 01:22:13.600
- It's my name.
- Why the fuck wouldn't you be able

01:22:13.600 --> 01:22:14.935
- to call him Mr. Gill?
- What were your intentions

01:22:14.935 --> 01:22:18.146
with the YouTube videos
and your social media posts on GameStop?

01:22:18.146 --> 01:22:19.731
- Yes.
- Thank you, congresswoman.

01:22:19.731 --> 01:22:20.649
You're welcome.

01:22:20.649 --> 01:22:23.235
I developed a theory
that the company was undervalued

01:22:23.235 --> 01:22:25.153
despite the significant short interest.

01:22:25.153 --> 01:22:27.155
Oh, so you were aware
of the short interest.

01:22:27.155 --> 01:22:28.532
It is public knowledge.

01:22:28.532 --> 01:22:29.741
You can see it in the SEC filings.

01:22:29.741 --> 01:22:31.493
And your goal was
to break these shorts, yes?

01:22:31.493 --> 01:22:35.706
To rally an online mob to artificially
push the price of GameStop soaring,

01:22:35.706 --> 01:22:39.084
ah, "to the moon" as they say,
isn't that correct, Mr. Gill?

01:22:39.084 --> 01:22:40.252
Objection, objection,

01:22:40.252 --> 01:22:41.378
- you're leading the witness.
- Kev...

01:22:41.378 --> 01:22:43.547
- Witness.
- I yield my time to the chair.

01:22:43.547 --> 01:22:45.174
You were hoping for the short squeeze,

01:22:45.174 --> 01:22:46.967
- weren't you, Mr. Gill?
- You short squeezing bastard.

01:22:46.967 --> 01:22:48.719
The short squeeze was a marginal

01:22:48.719 --> 01:22:50.220
- point of the thesis.
- Then why did you talk about it

01:22:50.220 --> 01:22:51.889
- in your videos all the time?
- You did talk about it in your videos.

01:22:51.889 --> 01:22:53.056
You talked about it a lot.

01:22:53.056 --> 01:22:54.600
- You remember about the squeeze.
- Exactly.

01:22:54.600 --> 01:22:55.809
You were like
"It's just a little squeeze."

01:22:55.809 --> 01:22:56.810
Exactly.

01:22:56.810 --> 01:22:59.354
Are you really asking us to believe
that you weren't a leader

01:22:59.354 --> 01:23:01.565
- to all these retail traders?
- You're fucked, buddy.

01:23:01.565 --> 01:23:03.734
- My point of view...
- Asking. Yes or no?

01:23:03.734 --> 01:23:05.235
- Yes or no?
- Yes. So yes.

01:23:05.235 --> 01:23:06.445
- Yes or no?
- You are admitting it. Yes.

01:23:06.445 --> 01:23:07.863
Remember you with a cheap bottle
of champagne.

01:23:07.863 --> 01:23:09.072
At any moment... Kevin!

01:23:09.072 --> 01:23:10.115
- Kevin!
- Dunking tendies like a fucking--

01:23:10.115 --> 01:23:11.033
What?

01:23:12.326 --> 01:23:14.703
I'm running with my dick out.

01:23:15.787 --> 01:23:17.164
Okay, why don't you just say that?

01:23:17.164 --> 01:23:18.540
Okay, I'll stop.

01:23:19.333 --> 01:23:24.213
All right. Mr. Gill, what exactly
about the fundamentals

01:23:24.213 --> 01:23:27.508
- led you to build this bull case?
- What the fuck's with the voice?

01:23:27.508 --> 01:23:29.843
I don't know, I was trying to do AOC,
but it was flat.

01:23:29.843 --> 01:23:31.136
I don't even think she's on the panel.

01:23:31.136 --> 01:23:32.346
You shut the fuck up, Briggsy.

01:23:32.346 --> 01:23:33.722
- I'll slap the shit out of you.
- Is she on that panel?

01:23:33.722 --> 01:23:34.640
- I swear to God.
- You're gonna slap me?

01:23:34.640 --> 01:23:36.016
- Yeah, let's go.
- You ready to go?

01:23:36.016 --> 01:23:38.644
<i>- Let's go.
- I've been waiting for this, dog.</i>

01:23:56.119 --> 01:23:56.954
Come here.

01:24:05.712 --> 01:24:07.673
You're gonna be great.

01:24:08.924 --> 01:24:11.635
If it goes bad, it's gonna be real bad.

01:24:11.635 --> 01:24:13.428
Well, don't let it go bad.

01:24:13.428 --> 01:24:17.683
<i>This hearing will be first in a series
of hearings by the committee</i>

01:24:17.683 --> 01:24:22.771
<i>to examine the recent market volatility
involving GameStop.</i>

01:24:22.771 --> 01:24:27.359
<i>I want to know how each
of the witnesses here today</i>

01:24:27.359 --> 01:24:29.528
- <i>contributed to the historic...</i>
- Gabe, can you sit up?

01:24:29.528 --> 01:24:32.698
<i>trading events in January.</i>

01:24:33.240 --> 01:24:35.492
<i>This recent market volatility</i>

01:24:35.492 --> 01:24:40.080
<i>has put a national spotlight
on institutional practices</i>

01:24:40.080 --> 01:24:41.748
<i>by Wall Street firms.</i>

01:24:41.748 --> 01:24:45.419
<i>And they have demonstrated
the enormous potential power</i>

01:24:45.419 --> 01:24:48.130
<i>of social media in our markets.</i>

01:24:48.714 --> 01:24:52.259
<i>We will hear firsthand from the witnesses
regarding these events.</i>

01:24:52.885 --> 01:24:57.055
<i>The hearing will be an opportunity
for this committee to get the facts</i>

01:24:57.055 --> 01:25:00.309
<i>about the role
each of the witnesses represent,</i>

01:25:00.309 --> 01:25:03.937
<i>played in the events
we are examining today.</i>

01:25:03.937 --> 01:25:06.398
<i>Well, now, Mr. Griffin, if I could
just ask you this first question.</i>

01:25:06.398 --> 01:25:07.316
Of course.

01:25:07.316 --> 01:25:09.484
<i>How many people
are in the room with you?</i>

01:25:10.402 --> 01:25:11.403
That's your question?

01:25:11.403 --> 01:25:13.488
<i>If you can just count how many
people are in the room with you.</i>

01:25:18.118 --> 01:25:21.622
<i>There are five people,
including myself, in this room.</i>

01:25:21.622 --> 01:25:23.290
- <i>Did anyone in your organization...</i>
- Such a prick.

01:25:23.290 --> 01:25:25.501
<i>since January 1st, contact Robinhood?</i>

01:25:25.501 --> 01:25:30.339
We of course talk to Robinhood routinely
in the ordinary course of business.

01:25:30.339 --> 01:25:32.090
We manage a substantial portion
of their order flow.

01:25:32.090 --> 01:25:35.052
<i>But did you talk to them about restricting</i>

01:25:35.052 --> 01:25:39.264
<i>or doing anything to prevent people
from buying GameStop?</i>

01:25:39.264 --> 01:25:42.059
I want to be perfectly clear.

01:25:42.059 --> 01:25:45.771
<i>We had no role in Robinhood's decision</i>

01:25:45.771 --> 01:25:48.023
- <i>to limit trading in GameStop.</i>
- Fuck you, Ken Griffin.

01:25:48.023 --> 01:25:51.902
<i>So, if we depose everyone
in your organization, we would find that?</i>

01:25:52.569 --> 01:25:53.487
That is correct.

01:25:53.487 --> 01:25:56.114
Looks like a Disney Channel villain.

01:25:56.114 --> 01:26:00.702
<i>Mr. Plotkin, do you believe
that there is manipulation, distrust,</i>

01:26:00.702 --> 01:26:03.622
<i>and overall inequality
within American finance?</i>

01:26:03.622 --> 01:26:05.791
My focus is on my company, Melvin...

01:26:07.543 --> 01:26:08.627
Hello?

01:26:08.627 --> 01:26:10.337
You're on mute, dick!

01:26:10.337 --> 01:26:11.964
<i>Ah, I'm sorry, you're on mute.</i>

01:26:16.176 --> 01:26:17.845
He just keeps going.

01:26:17.845 --> 01:26:19.680
...my area of expertise.

01:26:19.680 --> 01:26:23.433
<i>You're still on mute. I haven't been able
to hear a word you said, unfortunately.</i>

01:26:23.433 --> 01:26:25.310
<i>Mr. Tenev, would you be willing
to commit today</i>

01:26:25.310 --> 01:26:27.980
<i>- to voluntarily pass on the proceeds...</i>
- Oh. Marry me.

01:26:27.980 --> 01:26:30.774
<i>of the payment for order flow
to Robinhood customers?</i>

01:26:30.774 --> 01:26:33.318
Congresswoman, I appreciate that question.

01:26:33.318 --> 01:26:37.531
When the statement you refer to was made,
it was before Robinhood forced

01:26:37.531 --> 01:26:39.533
the entire industry to drop

01:26:39.533 --> 01:26:41.243
- commissions and replicate our...
<i>- I should take that as a no.</i>

01:26:41.243 --> 01:26:44.079
<i>You're not willing to pass on
the proceeds of payment for order flow</i>

01:26:44.079 --> 01:26:45.038
<i>to your customers?</i>

01:26:45.038 --> 01:26:47.749
- When the other brokers drop...
- <i>I'm just talking about today.</i>

01:26:47.749 --> 01:26:48.959
- Asshole.
- <i>I don't want to be rude.</i>

01:26:48.959 --> 01:26:50.335
<i>I just have limited time,</i>

01:26:50.335 --> 01:26:54.339
<i>but if removing the revenues that you make
from a payment for order flow</i>

01:26:54.339 --> 01:26:57.843
<i>would cause the removal
of free commissions,</i>

01:26:57.843 --> 01:26:59.636
<i>doesn't that mean that
trading on Robinhood</i>

01:26:59.636 --> 01:27:01.597
<i>isn't actually free to begin with?</i>

01:27:01.597 --> 01:27:02.973
Good question.

01:27:09.605 --> 01:27:11.857
<i>Thank you very much, Mr. Gill.</i>

01:27:11.857 --> 01:27:16.486
<i>You are now recognized for five minutes
to present your oral testimony.</i>

01:27:28.415 --> 01:27:30.876
Thank you, members of the committee.

01:27:33.420 --> 01:27:36.715
I am happy to discuss my purchase
of GameStop shares

01:27:37.299 --> 01:27:40.677
and my discussions of their fair value
on social media.

01:27:41.512 --> 01:27:43.138
But before I do that,

01:27:43.138 --> 01:27:45.057
a few things I am not:

01:27:46.850 --> 01:27:48.060
I am not a cat.

01:27:49.603 --> 01:27:51.855
- What did he say?
- He just said cat, Ma.

01:27:51.855 --> 01:27:54.107
- It's like a kitty thing.
- <i>Nor am I a hedge fund.</i>

01:27:54.107 --> 01:27:55.567
<i>I do not have clients,</i>

01:27:55.567 --> 01:28:00.906
<i>and I do not provide personalized
investment advice for fees or commissions.</i>

01:28:00.906 --> 01:28:02.991
I grew up in Brockton, Mass.

01:28:03.742 --> 01:28:05.619
My family was not wealthy.

01:28:05.619 --> 01:28:08.956
<i>My father was a truck driver
and my mom a registered nurse.</i>

01:28:08.956 --> 01:28:11.166
- That's you, Ma!
- I was one of three kids

01:28:11.166 --> 01:28:14.211
and the first in my family
to earn a four-year college degree

01:28:14.211 --> 01:28:18.423
when I graduated from Stonehill College
in 2009.

01:28:18.423 --> 01:28:20.551
<i>That was not a good time
to be looking for a job.</i>

01:28:20.551 --> 01:28:23.053
<i>From 2010-2017,</i>

01:28:23.053 --> 01:28:26.515
<i>there were significant periods
when I was unemployed.</i>

01:28:26.515 --> 01:28:28.892
<i>I took an interest in the stock market,</i>

01:28:28.892 --> 01:28:31.186
and even though I had very little money,

01:28:31.186 --> 01:28:35.399
I used those times to educate myself
and learn more about investing.

01:28:35.399 --> 01:28:39.361
<i>Mr. Gill, I find it hard to believe
that you predicted everything</i>

01:28:39.361 --> 01:28:43.031
<i>that happened to GameStop
with no inside information.</i>

01:28:43.031 --> 01:28:44.783
I didn't predict it.

01:28:44.783 --> 01:28:48.161
I honestly couldn't explain everything
that happened in January.

01:28:48.161 --> 01:28:49.288
<i>I've seen your videos.</i>

01:28:49.288 --> 01:28:52.624
<i>You honestly couldn't recount
to the committee what caused</i>

01:28:52.624 --> 01:28:56.587
<i>every single up and down of the stock
in January?</i>

01:28:57.171 --> 01:28:58.297
<i>I think you could.</i>

01:28:59.631 --> 01:29:03.010
I did follow the stock very closely,

01:29:03.010 --> 01:29:06.638
but threshold lists, order flows,
halting purchases, according to the press,

01:29:06.638 --> 01:29:08.599
these all had a material impact
on the stock.

01:29:08.599 --> 01:29:11.268
Here's the thing: I have
a bit of experience with this stuff,

01:29:11.268 --> 01:29:13.270
and even I barely understand
these matters.

01:29:13.270 --> 01:29:17.149
It's alarming how little we all know
about the inner workings of the market.

01:29:17.149 --> 01:29:19.860
Which is why I'm glad that this committee
is examining what happened,

01:29:19.860 --> 01:29:22.654
particularly with the exorbitant
short interest

01:29:22.654 --> 01:29:25.532
as well as any potentially
manipulative shorting practices

01:29:25.532 --> 01:29:29.786
and brokers' reported failures to
timely deliver shares and settle trades.

01:29:33.081 --> 01:29:35.292
A lot of people feel the system is broken.

01:29:35.292 --> 01:29:39.379
<i>The whole idea of the stock market is to
be, like, kind of a fair playing field,</i>

01:29:39.379 --> 01:29:43.217
<i>where if you're smart, maybe with a little
luck, you could make your fortune.</i>

01:29:44.092 --> 01:29:46.428
<i>But, if it ever was that,
it's certainly not any more.</i>

01:29:47.513 --> 01:29:50.849
The big firms have such a big advantage,
in terms of technology and information

01:29:50.849 --> 01:29:54.186
and just sheer wealth, there's no hope
for the little guy anymore.

01:29:54.937 --> 01:29:56.813
<i>Or there was no hope.</i>

01:29:57.564 --> 01:29:59.608
<i>Maybe now, there is.</i>

01:30:01.777 --> 01:30:03.237
And as for me,

01:30:03.946 --> 01:30:05.113
I like the stock.

01:30:06.198 --> 01:30:08.575
He's a gangster for that.

01:30:08.575 --> 01:30:10.285
I don't plan on selling any time soon.

01:30:10.285 --> 01:30:11.995
- Hold it.
- Say that shit.

01:30:11.995 --> 01:30:13.038
Diamond fucking hands.

01:30:13.038 --> 01:30:14.039
Diamond hands, baby.

01:30:15.165 --> 01:30:16.708
Attaboy.

01:30:16.708 --> 01:30:18.085
What a nerd.

01:30:18.710 --> 01:30:19.545
Thank you.

01:30:27.302 --> 01:30:29.721
It was good. I think.

Cheers, everyone.

01:31:57.392 --> 01:31:58.936
You're a fucking gangster.

01:32:18.580 --> 01:32:20.916
Hey, man, I notice you've been selling
a lot of new games,

01:32:20.916 --> 01:32:24.378
and I just wanted to remind you, again,
that we really wanna be pushing customers

01:32:24.378 --> 01:32:26.964
towards the higher-margin pre-owned games.

01:32:28.006 --> 01:32:29.967
Yeah, I'm not gonna do that.

01:32:29.967 --> 01:32:30.926
Excuse me?

01:32:30.926 --> 01:32:33.595
Oh, and in fact, I'm not gonna do
any of the Circle of Life bullshit.

01:32:33.595 --> 01:32:35.055
Or your TikTok dance contest.

01:32:35.055 --> 01:32:36.139
You're quitting, then.

01:32:38.100 --> 01:32:39.101
Okay.

01:32:39.101 --> 01:32:40.936
No, I mean, I thought about it, but...

01:32:41.937 --> 01:32:43.730
Like, yo, I love it here.

01:32:43.730 --> 01:32:45.482
So I think I'm gonna stay.

01:32:45.482 --> 01:32:49.027
Well, you're awfully smug for a kid
who lost all his money buying stock.

01:32:49.528 --> 01:32:51.947
What did you say it was going to?
A thousand?

01:32:53.198 --> 01:32:55.701
I'm also not gonna work
at the ass crack of dawn any more.

01:32:56.827 --> 01:32:57.703
You're fired.

01:32:59.621 --> 01:33:00.873
No, I'm not.

01:33:00.873 --> 01:33:03.667
You gotta get that approved
by like seven levels of people, yo.

01:33:04.168 --> 01:33:06.712
Thanks to the geniuses
who put that together.

01:33:06.712 --> 01:33:08.755
The ones who used to own my ass.

01:33:09.256 --> 01:33:10.257
You sold?

01:33:11.550 --> 01:33:12.384
Half.

01:33:13.719 --> 01:33:15.679
Right at the tippy tippy top.

01:33:15.679 --> 01:33:18.515
And I'm holding the other half
for the long haul.

I can't believe you're my brother.
