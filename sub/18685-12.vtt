WEBVTT

00:00.034 --> 00:02.803
(sucking)

00:02.836 --> 00:04.038
MICKEY:
What are you doing?

00:04.072 --> 00:05.339
You never sucked
anything before?

00:05.373 --> 00:07.508
I'm sucking as hard
as I can, okay?

00:07.541 --> 00:09.677
It's not coming.
Well, suck harder.

00:09.710 --> 00:12.012
All right, and now
for the finale of the tour,

00:12.046 --> 00:13.681
we have all my sweet cars.

00:13.714 --> 00:16.084
See, I don't drive them yet,
but when I do, oh,

00:16.117 --> 00:18.018
I'm gonna drive
the fricking crap out of them.

00:18.052 --> 00:19.387
Who are the gypsies?

00:19.420 --> 00:20.388
The what?

00:20.421 --> 00:21.855
The gypsies.
JIMMY:
Hello...

00:21.889 --> 00:23.591
Oh, oh, don't worry about
them, they're nothing.

00:23.624 --> 00:25.326
Got to run.
Talk to you later, babe.

00:25.359 --> 00:27.761
Okay, good-bye,
Prince Handso...

00:27.795 --> 00:30.598
What's up, Prince Handsome?
Who's that girl?

00:30.631 --> 00:32.900
That woman is Yulia.

00:32.933 --> 00:33.934
We met online.

00:33.967 --> 00:35.203
Like an online dating thing?

00:35.236 --> 00:37.438
Kind of.
HotEuroCamGirls.com

00:37.471 --> 00:38.606
Oh, God.
Oh.

00:38.639 --> 00:39.840
JIMMY:
Oh, yeah.

00:39.873 --> 00:41.275
Mm.
I don't have the coin

00:41.309 --> 00:42.443
to actually go inside there,

00:42.476 --> 00:44.445
but I've seen those ads
pop up on my screen.

00:44.478 --> 00:45.879
MICKEY:
I mean, come on, Chip.

00:45.913 --> 00:47.881
She doesn't like you.
You know that, right?

00:47.915 --> 00:49.117
No duh. I'm not delusional.

00:49.150 --> 00:50.351
That's why I'm
flying her out here

00:50.384 --> 00:51.785
so we can get to know
each other in person.

00:51.819 --> 00:54.255
(laughing): Oh.
(laughs)

00:54.288 --> 00:57.791
Oh, Chip,
that is so pathetic.

00:57.825 --> 00:59.527
Oh, I'm pathetic?
Yeah.
Yeah.

00:59.560 --> 01:00.628
Yeah, I'm not the one doing

01:00.661 --> 01:01.695
whatever the hell
you guys are doing.

01:01.729 --> 01:02.796
What-What are you doing?

01:02.830 --> 01:04.365
We're siphoning gas
out of the GT

01:04.398 --> 01:05.966
to put in the Lambo
to move the Lambo,

01:05.999 --> 01:07.801
so we can take
the Speedster into town.

01:07.835 --> 01:09.270
Why not just take the Lambo?

01:09.303 --> 01:11.305
Because...
'cause then we wouldn't

01:11.339 --> 01:12.306
be driving the Speedster.

01:12.340 --> 01:13.474
What is he saying?

01:13.507 --> 01:14.708
I don't know.
He doesn't get it.

01:14.742 --> 01:15.909
What's with the hoses?

01:15.943 --> 01:17.778
I just got done
explaining it to you.

01:17.811 --> 01:19.213
We're siphoning.

01:19.247 --> 01:20.981
Did your mom not
teach you anything?

01:21.014 --> 01:23.251
You wouldn't last five seconds
in the real world.

01:23.284 --> 01:25.653
This kid's all Pemberton
and no Molng.

01:25.686 --> 01:26.720
No what?

01:26.754 --> 01:27.655
Mole?

01:27.688 --> 01:30.158
Molng. My last name.
Mullen?

01:30.191 --> 01:32.326
No. Mullen? Molng.

01:32.360 --> 01:33.994
M-O-L-N-G.
Molng.

01:34.027 --> 01:35.729
You need to say it from
the back of your throat.

01:35.763 --> 01:37.998
What? Did your mom not ever
tell you her maiden name?

01:38.031 --> 01:39.900
No. I don't blame her
with a name like that.
Okay, you know what?

01:39.933 --> 01:41.602
Get out of here.
Go play with your webcam girl,

01:41.635 --> 01:43.271
who you're never gonna see
in real life, by the way.

01:43.304 --> 01:44.505
Oh, yes, I will.

01:44.538 --> 01:46.307
She'll be here Friday,
so why don't you see

01:46.340 --> 01:48.176
if they got a couple spare
cages down at the kennel?

01:48.209 --> 01:50.844
I guarantee that money already
went straight up her nose.

01:50.878 --> 01:51.945
I don't know what that means,

01:51.979 --> 01:54.715
but whatever it is,
you're wrong.

01:58.619 --> 02:01.522
Ooh, fancy pants.
(Alba chuckles)

02:01.555 --> 02:02.956
You going somewhere fun?

02:02.990 --> 02:04.192
Yeah, Kai's taking me
out to dinner.

02:04.225 --> 02:05.193
Who's Kai?

02:05.226 --> 02:06.394
My fiancÃ©.

02:08.562 --> 02:11.199
The one you manipulated into
thinking he got me pregnant.

02:11.232 --> 02:13.201
The guy with the milky abs?

02:13.234 --> 02:14.535
Oh. Oh, that guy?

02:14.568 --> 02:15.536
He's still a thing?

02:15.569 --> 02:16.970
Yes, he's still a thing.

02:17.004 --> 02:18.972
He's been studying furniture
design in Scandinavia.

02:19.006 --> 02:20.874
Mmm.
Hey, babe.

02:20.908 --> 02:22.376
Hey, what's going on?
I thought we had a reservation.

02:22.410 --> 02:23.511
Oh, yeah.

02:23.544 --> 02:24.878
I thought we could
just post up instead.

02:24.912 --> 02:26.547
The Chinese food
in Sweden sucked.

02:26.580 --> 02:27.548
Hey, everybody.

02:27.581 --> 02:28.782
Mm.
Hey, Kai.

02:28.816 --> 02:30.218
How was furniture school?

02:30.251 --> 02:31.485
I didn't end up going.

02:31.519 --> 02:32.653
Yeah, the application
wasn't in English,

02:32.686 --> 02:34.054
so I just did my own thing.

02:34.087 --> 02:36.324
Oh, it wasn't in English
so he didn't go.
Well...

02:36.357 --> 02:39.059
Yeah, a lot of sauna,
ate some fish.

02:39.092 --> 02:40.894
Huh.
Anyway, I'm gonna go beast
on this Kung Pao

02:40.928 --> 02:41.895
before it gets cold.
(chuckles)

02:41.929 --> 02:42.896
It was nice seeing you guys.

02:42.930 --> 02:46.234
(laughs)

02:46.267 --> 02:48.536
(laughs) Well, that
was a fun exchange.
Yeah.

02:48.569 --> 02:50.471
You know, he's still
figuring some stuff out.

02:50.504 --> 02:52.139
Look, man, I am
not judging, okay?

02:52.172 --> 02:53.241
At least he's a hot loser.

02:53.274 --> 02:55.476
(scoffs)
Kai's not a loser.

02:55.509 --> 02:56.477
Jimmy's a loser.

02:56.510 --> 02:57.478
Absolutely.

02:57.511 --> 02:58.579
They remind me a
lot of each other.

02:58.612 --> 03:00.848
That's insane.
They are nothing alike.

03:00.881 --> 03:02.250
Look, when I
first met Jimmy,

03:02.283 --> 03:04.418
he was a tight
little slice of ass.

03:04.452 --> 03:06.320
Then at some point, he kind
of just let himself go,

03:06.354 --> 03:07.855
started growing breasts.

03:07.888 --> 03:09.923
We've kind of just been
phoning it in ever since.

03:09.957 --> 03:11.725
I do not like where
this is going.

03:11.759 --> 03:14.027
Two Jimmys is
too many Jimmys.

03:14.061 --> 03:15.763
Kung Pao.
(laughs)

03:15.796 --> 03:16.930
(Kai laughs)

03:16.964 --> 03:19.300
Oh.

03:21.969 --> 03:23.203
MICKEY (laughing): Okay.

03:23.237 --> 03:26.274
I like how you made
your bangs extra big.

03:26.307 --> 03:27.608
(laughing):
The girls love a big bang.

03:27.641 --> 03:29.042
Am I right?

03:29.076 --> 03:30.844
Hey, ooh, Chip,
I have a question for you.

03:30.878 --> 03:33.113
Um, does it
make you nervous

03:33.146 --> 03:34.515
(laughing): that there's
only one bag left?

03:34.548 --> 03:36.216
Does that bother you?

03:36.250 --> 03:38.118
Shut up, okay.
Mm. Mm-hmm.

03:38.151 --> 03:39.920
Come on, Yulia.

03:39.953 --> 03:42.055
Show yourself.

03:42.089 --> 03:45.192
Um, hey, bud, think it might be
time to throw the towel in.

03:45.225 --> 03:46.594
(laughing):
What do you think?

03:46.627 --> 03:48.829
Okay, you need to
stop. Stop right now.
Yeah. Sure.

03:50.731 --> 03:52.433
Look, there she is.

03:52.466 --> 03:54.802
Eh?
Yulia.

03:56.337 --> 03:58.138
(Chip and Mickey shout)

03:58.171 --> 04:02.943
(laughing)
Oh. Oh, sorry, I thought
you were someone else.

04:06.179 --> 04:08.181
(laughing)

04:11.485 --> 04:12.720
(laughing):
Oh, my God.

04:12.753 --> 04:14.788
Oh, it was so good.

04:14.822 --> 04:17.325
How could I be so blind?

04:17.358 --> 04:19.593
Thought Yulia
was a beautiful angel.

04:19.627 --> 04:23.163
Turns out she's just
a beautiful, lying whore.

04:23.196 --> 04:25.999
(sighs)

04:26.033 --> 04:29.169
All right, look,
first of all,

04:29.202 --> 04:31.171
don't talk about women
like that, okay?

04:31.204 --> 04:33.341
Second of all...
(sighs)

04:33.374 --> 04:34.742
...you know,
the world's full

04:34.775 --> 04:36.910
of wolves and sheep, right?

04:36.944 --> 04:38.479
Yulia, she's a wolf.

04:38.512 --> 04:39.580
I'm a wolf.

04:39.613 --> 04:41.248
But you, you're a sheep.

04:41.281 --> 04:43.617
And see, it's the wolf's job
to eat the sheep, right?

04:43.651 --> 04:45.753
And so, y-you know,
this was bound to happen.

04:45.786 --> 04:48.422
Great, so I'm gonna spend
the rest of my life

04:48.456 --> 04:49.757
getting devoured.

04:49.790 --> 04:53.260
I mean, not necessarily.

04:53.293 --> 04:54.928
You know, you are
half Molng, right?

04:54.962 --> 04:56.163
I guess.

04:56.196 --> 04:57.531
Yeah, so we just
got to make sure

04:57.565 --> 04:59.299
that Molng part
rises to the top.

04:59.333 --> 05:01.835
(sighs) All right.
What the hell.

05:01.869 --> 05:03.604
Teach me how to be a Mulk.

05:03.637 --> 05:05.205
It's Molng.

05:05.238 --> 05:06.374
Molnga.

05:06.407 --> 05:08.742
Oh, we'll practice
in the car.

05:13.146 --> 05:17.184
All right, time to stop being
prey and start being a predator.

05:17.217 --> 05:19.787
First things first, you need
to learn to feed yourself.

05:19.820 --> 05:21.555
Go steal
some chips.

05:21.589 --> 05:22.856
Mm, no, thanks.

05:22.890 --> 05:24.324
Ironically, I'm not
a big chip guy.

05:24.358 --> 05:25.559
Well... that doesn't matter.

05:25.593 --> 05:26.994
I'm trying to teach
you something here.

05:27.027 --> 05:28.228
A wolf takes
what it needs.

05:28.261 --> 05:29.730
Yeah, but I don't need chips.

05:29.763 --> 05:31.565
I just ate a quesadilla.

05:31.599 --> 05:34.201
You ate without me?
I was hungry.

05:34.234 --> 05:36.504
All right, that's...
that's not the point, okay?

05:36.537 --> 05:38.972
You think a wolf just walks
by a deer and is like, "Meh.

05:39.006 --> 05:41.241
Uh... I'm not that hungry.
I just had a quesadilla."

05:41.274 --> 05:42.576
Where would a wolf
get a quesadilla?

05:42.610 --> 05:44.578
G... Go steal the chips, okay?

05:44.612 --> 05:46.246
And I'll meet you outside.

05:46.279 --> 05:47.581
Be smart. Be stealthy.

05:47.615 --> 05:50.551
Be smooth, just like a wo...
Oh, my God, get away from me.

05:52.352 --> 05:53.621
You got this.

05:55.022 --> 05:56.724
Uh...

05:56.757 --> 05:59.259
*

05:59.292 --> 06:01.595
* Yes, I'm a mutating French *

06:01.629 --> 06:02.996
* Kissing Andy *

06:03.030 --> 06:04.932
* Kissing Jack, kissing Johnny,
kissing Mike *

06:04.965 --> 06:07.000
* Smacking chicks
and licking faces *

06:07.034 --> 06:10.538
* Snugging ladies,
slapping boys, boys, boys *

06:10.571 --> 06:11.839
* Going hot, tease your daddy *

06:11.872 --> 06:13.741
* Driving wild, wild nuts *

06:13.774 --> 06:15.743
* Yes, I'm a mutating French *

06:15.776 --> 06:19.179
* Kissing Andy, kissing Jack,
kissing Johnny *

06:19.212 --> 06:21.849
* Kissing Mike, smacking chicks
and licking faces... *

06:21.882 --> 06:24.017
Wh...
Lesson number one:

06:24.051 --> 06:25.285
trust no one.

06:25.318 --> 06:26.687
Are you insane?

06:26.720 --> 06:29.289
You almost just got me
arrested over a bag of chips.

06:29.322 --> 06:31.625
Here's your cut.

06:31.659 --> 06:33.461
I don't want the chicken!
I didn't want the chips!

06:33.494 --> 06:35.028
You used me.

06:35.062 --> 06:36.930
Lesson number two: you look
around the room, you can't

06:36.964 --> 06:38.866
spot the sucker, chances
are you're the sucker.

06:38.899 --> 06:41.134
I know I'm the sucker.
That's why we're here.

06:41.168 --> 06:43.403
You're supposed to teach me
how to be a wolf.

06:43.437 --> 06:44.472
Well, I know a
wolf wouldn't let

06:44.505 --> 06:46.406
a perfectly good
chicken go to waste.

06:46.440 --> 06:48.542
Fine. Fine.

06:48.576 --> 06:51.078
I'll eat the damn chicken.

06:51.111 --> 06:52.145
Psycho.

06:52.179 --> 06:54.314
Congratulations.
You're ready

06:54.347 --> 06:56.484
to move on to phase two
of your training.

06:56.517 --> 06:58.218
Well, finish the chicken.

06:58.251 --> 07:00.320
I mean, I worked very hard
to steal that chicken.

07:02.923 --> 07:04.992
Turns out he was
Mormon the whole time.

07:05.025 --> 07:06.494
(both laugh)

07:06.527 --> 07:08.028
(door opens)

07:09.597 --> 07:10.564
Oh...

07:10.598 --> 07:13.100
Didn't realize, um,

07:13.133 --> 07:14.434
you guys were hanging out.

07:14.468 --> 07:15.836
Oh, yeah.

07:15.869 --> 07:17.505
We got a
friendship cooking.

07:17.538 --> 07:19.640
Terrific.
Can I talk to Kai?

07:19.673 --> 07:21.274
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

07:21.308 --> 07:22.976
(groaning):
Absolutely.

07:24.344 --> 07:26.313
(pounds on door)
You got to lift it.

07:26.346 --> 07:30.183
Oh.
Yeah, you got it.

07:30.217 --> 07:32.119
This guy knows his stuff.

07:32.152 --> 07:35.188
(door closes)
Ah, he's great.

07:35.222 --> 07:36.690
So what's up, babe?

07:36.724 --> 07:38.025
You know...

07:38.058 --> 07:40.160
I was just wondering,
now that you're home,

07:40.193 --> 07:41.795
what's your plan?

07:41.829 --> 07:44.097
I don't know. You want to see
a movie or something?

07:44.131 --> 07:46.133
No. No.

07:46.166 --> 07:47.935
I-I meant something bigger.

07:47.968 --> 07:49.970
Oh, you mean like an IMAX?

07:50.003 --> 07:52.272
Forget the movie.

07:52.305 --> 07:56.209
Kai, what are your dreams?

07:56.243 --> 07:59.212
(scoffs)
Well, you are, babe.

07:59.246 --> 08:01.849
I got everything I need
right here in this sauna.

08:01.882 --> 08:03.617
Maybe you should
start figuring it out

08:03.651 --> 08:05.719
so that people don't think
that you're a loser.

08:05.753 --> 08:07.287
People think I'm a loser?

08:07.320 --> 08:09.723
No.

08:09.757 --> 08:11.224
(scoffs)
No.

08:11.258 --> 08:12.626
They don't now.

08:12.660 --> 08:14.628
But they might
think that soon.

08:14.662 --> 08:16.463
You know?

08:16.496 --> 08:17.965
So maybe it's a good time

08:17.998 --> 08:20.467
to just start
thinking about it.

08:20.500 --> 08:22.536
Yeah.
Yeah.

08:22.570 --> 08:24.638
For you, anything.
Thank you.

08:24.672 --> 08:25.906
I'll let you
get back to it.

08:25.939 --> 08:27.107
Okay.
Okay, good.

08:29.109 --> 08:30.343
Oh, you got to lift it.

08:30.377 --> 08:32.079
Yeah, I live here.

08:32.112 --> 08:33.380
Okay.

08:33.413 --> 08:35.649
Step into my office.

08:35.683 --> 08:36.984
(indistinct race chatter on TVs)

08:37.017 --> 08:38.686
Your office
smells like urine.

08:38.719 --> 08:39.920
I thought we were
going to a horse race.

08:39.953 --> 08:41.054
What the hell
is this place?

08:41.088 --> 08:42.756
It's off track betting.

08:42.790 --> 08:44.424
Why'd I wear a suit?

08:44.457 --> 08:46.026
Beats me;
that was your choice.

08:46.059 --> 08:47.327
Okay, if you want
to be a wolf,

08:47.360 --> 08:50.497
you're gonna need
to learn to spot a sheep.

08:50.530 --> 08:52.099
(cheering)

08:52.132 --> 08:53.200
What about that guy?

08:53.233 --> 08:54.367
Very good. Why?

08:54.401 --> 08:55.769
'Cause he's waving
his money around

08:55.803 --> 08:57.437
like a jackass.
Exactly.

08:57.470 --> 08:59.172
Kind of like you with
your Internet prostitute.

08:59.206 --> 09:01.341
What? She's not an
Internet prostitute.

09:01.374 --> 09:02.610
Yeah. Yes, she is.

09:02.643 --> 09:03.844
Will you just
get to the point?

09:03.877 --> 09:06.146
Yeah. Okay.

09:07.648 --> 09:09.282
All right.
First things first.

09:09.316 --> 09:10.718
Wha... ?

09:10.751 --> 09:12.452
Oh! What the hell?

09:12.485 --> 09:13.787
Wh... Ugh!

09:13.821 --> 09:15.856
Okay. Your turn, do me.

09:15.889 --> 09:18.125
And don't give me one of your
sissy taps, either, okay?

09:18.158 --> 09:19.860
I need you to muster up
all the strength you can

09:19.893 --> 09:21.629
in that tiny, pale,
bony body of yours.

09:22.329 --> 09:24.798
(grunts)

09:24.832 --> 09:26.967
(indistinct cheering)
MAN: Come on, come on, man.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.770
I will ruin you
when we get home.

09:30.838 --> 09:32.139
Now give me your wallet.

09:32.172 --> 09:33.907
No way, I don't trust you.

09:33.941 --> 09:36.443
Very nice.
You're learning.

09:36.476 --> 09:38.211
Good. Do need the
wallet, though,

09:38.245 --> 09:40.047
'cause it's part of the thing,
so give it to me. I'll give it

09:40.080 --> 09:41.348
back to you in a minute;
you're gonna get it back.

09:42.950 --> 09:45.485
Okay, follow me.

09:45.518 --> 09:47.621
Look, he's making a move.

09:47.655 --> 09:49.556
Excuse me.
Here he goes.
Go, go.

09:49.589 --> 09:50.791
Excuse me.

09:50.824 --> 09:52.092
(indistinct cheering)

09:52.125 --> 09:54.261
Officer.

09:54.294 --> 09:56.964
Hey. My nephew and I just got
mugged in the parking lot.

09:56.997 --> 09:59.867
It's that guy in
the hat over there.

10:01.201 --> 10:03.203
Wait here.

10:05.038 --> 10:06.306
This the guy?

10:06.339 --> 10:07.340
Yep, that's him.

10:07.374 --> 10:08.642
What are you talking about?

10:08.676 --> 10:09.810
Check his pockets.

10:09.843 --> 10:11.011
You'll find my
nephew's wallet

10:11.044 --> 10:12.412
and a winning ticket
for the sixth race.

10:12.445 --> 10:14.682
I've never seen
this woman before.

10:14.715 --> 10:16.016
You okay?

10:16.049 --> 10:17.450
My apologies, ma'am.

10:17.484 --> 10:19.086
Don't worry about a thing.

10:19.119 --> 10:20.754
We'll handle it
from here.
Thank you.

10:20.788 --> 10:23.290
You like beating up on kids,
you sick son of a bitch?

10:23.323 --> 10:24.424
Uh, no. Whoa.
CHIP: Oh.

10:24.457 --> 10:25.859
(gambler grunts and groans)
Oh.

10:25.893 --> 10:27.494
MICKEY:
Okay.

10:27.527 --> 10:28.929
Yikes.
GAMBLER: I don't even know her!

10:28.962 --> 10:30.363
I'm not used to
working with kids.

10:30.397 --> 10:32.465
That really struck
a nerve. Oh, man!

10:32.499 --> 10:33.701
That was amazing.

10:33.734 --> 10:34.935
How much did we make?

10:34.968 --> 10:38.471
38 bucks... Boom.

10:39.673 --> 10:41.041
That-That's it?

10:41.074 --> 10:43.877
Hmm?
The suit you destroyed
cost a grand.

10:43.911 --> 10:45.779
Yeah. Lesson 14:
Dress casual.

10:45.813 --> 10:47.180
Wolves don't wear suits.

10:47.214 --> 10:48.716
Wolves don't wear anything.

10:48.749 --> 10:50.517
What are you... ?

10:50.550 --> 10:52.185
You got to cash the ticket.

10:54.722 --> 10:56.556
Will you please just relax?
(doorbell rings)

10:56.589 --> 10:58.325
Oh, that's
probably the cops.

10:58.358 --> 11:00.861
Here to throw us in jail
for $38 and a chicken.

11:00.894 --> 11:03.130
So calm down. Wolves
don't get rattled.

11:03.163 --> 11:05.966
You're not a wolf, you're
a frickin' bottom feeder.

11:05.999 --> 11:07.868
If anything,
you are an oyster,

11:07.901 --> 11:09.369
and I eat oysters.

11:09.402 --> 11:11.238
Why are you talking about
eating oysters?

11:11.271 --> 11:13.040
What the hell is going on?
Talk normal.

11:13.073 --> 11:14.074
I'm done with this.

11:14.107 --> 11:16.143
All right. Well,
wolves don't quit.

11:16.176 --> 11:18.011
Well, I do.
Chip...

11:18.045 --> 11:19.179
Someone's here to see you.

11:22.449 --> 11:24.752
Hello, my Chip.

11:29.589 --> 11:30.824
It was the crazies.

11:30.858 --> 11:34.094
The immigration people held me
for whole day.

11:34.127 --> 11:35.829
I tell them,
"I has my visa, misters,"

11:35.863 --> 11:37.164
but they don't do listening.

11:37.197 --> 11:38.531
Those scumbags.

11:38.565 --> 11:39.833
They didn't touch you,
did they?

11:39.867 --> 11:41.668
Okay. And why didn't
you just call Chip?

11:41.701 --> 11:43.837
I didn't has American telephone.

11:43.871 --> 11:45.272
You know what?

11:45.305 --> 11:48.108
Tomorrow you get yourself
a new phone.

11:48.141 --> 11:49.609
Oh, come on.

11:49.642 --> 11:51.378
So you're telling me
there was no phone

11:51.411 --> 11:52.780
for you to borrow?

11:52.813 --> 11:54.381
I'm sorry. This just
isn't adding up.

11:54.414 --> 11:56.750
Yulia's answered enough
questions for one day.

11:56.784 --> 11:59.086
She just flew across
the frickin' world.
Mm-hmm.

11:59.119 --> 12:00.954
Come on, Yulia.
I'll help you get settled.

12:00.988 --> 12:02.255
Alba!

12:09.462 --> 12:10.730
Who the hell is this?

12:10.764 --> 12:13.300
I am Yulia. I am
girlfriend of Chip.

12:13.333 --> 12:15.402
Oh, you've got
to be kidding me.

12:15.435 --> 12:18.505
Alba, can you please help Yulia
to the guest room?

12:19.572 --> 12:21.608
Thank you, Chip.
(Alba muttering)

12:21.641 --> 12:22.843
ALBA:
...crap outside.

12:25.946 --> 12:27.915
(Mickey clears throat)

12:31.118 --> 12:33.153
How does it taste?

12:33.186 --> 12:34.154
How does what taste?

12:34.187 --> 12:35.455
The frickin' foot in your mouth.

12:35.488 --> 12:36.957
I can't believe
I listened to you.

12:36.990 --> 12:38.491
Yulia's not scamming me.

12:38.525 --> 12:41.328
Oh, you stupid little boy.

12:41.361 --> 12:43.296
(laughs)

12:43.330 --> 12:45.665
You just let a wolf
right into the henhouse.

12:45.698 --> 12:47.968
It's a fox in the henhouse,
idiot.

12:48.001 --> 12:50.670
You don't let anything
into the henhouse.

12:50.703 --> 12:52.305
'Cause it'll eat the hens.

12:52.339 --> 12:55.275
(sighs)

12:57.010 --> 12:58.278
Hey. Whatcha doing?

12:58.311 --> 12:59.512
Oh, hey, babe.

12:59.546 --> 13:00.780
I'm just getting ready
to go to a meeting.

13:00.814 --> 13:02.482
You're going to a meeting
dressed like that?

13:02.515 --> 13:03.851
Oh, right.
(laughs)

13:03.884 --> 13:06.186
Ah, I got so excited, I
totally forgot to tell you.

13:06.219 --> 13:07.988
What?
I'm starting my
own business.

13:08.021 --> 13:09.589
You are?
Yeah.

13:09.622 --> 13:11.458
Babe, that's so great.
I'm really happy for you.

13:11.491 --> 13:12.659
Yeah. It's awesome.

13:12.692 --> 13:15.128
You ready to do this or what?
Oh.

13:15.162 --> 13:16.696
What's he doing here?
That's my business partner.

13:16.729 --> 13:18.331
Yeah, we're gonna go have
a brainstorming sesh

13:18.365 --> 13:20.433
right now in the sauna.
You two are working together.

13:20.467 --> 13:22.335
All that stuff you said
was really inspiring.

13:22.369 --> 13:24.371
What?
I told Jimmy about our talk.

13:24.404 --> 13:26.306
Wh... That's not what I...
It got me thinking.

13:26.339 --> 13:28.141
Who's the neediest
demographic?

13:28.175 --> 13:29.576
Women, right?

13:30.844 --> 13:33.013
What do women love?
Beef.

13:33.046 --> 13:34.047
And what do they hate?

13:34.081 --> 13:35.682
Fixing crap.

13:35.715 --> 13:39.186
So we put the two together,
and came up with...

13:39.219 --> 13:40.888
Stud Nailers.
Yeah.

13:40.921 --> 13:42.856
It's our shirtless
handyman service.

13:42.890 --> 13:44.958
It's like topless
maids, but dudes.

13:44.992 --> 13:46.726
Plus, having a
business partner,

13:46.759 --> 13:48.295
who's also a friend,

13:48.328 --> 13:50.130
takes off a lot
of pressure.

13:50.163 --> 13:51.564
Now, see? That story alone's

13:51.598 --> 13:53.133
gonna get us tons
of customers, man.

13:53.166 --> 13:56.536
And then this ab thing,
that is icing on the cake.

13:56.569 --> 13:58.171
Your abs are made of cake.

13:58.205 --> 13:59.406
Okay. Well,
right now they are,

13:59.439 --> 14:01.408
so Kai hits the field
solo for a little bit,

14:01.441 --> 14:02.842
I hang back,
drop some L-Bs,

14:02.876 --> 14:04.744
and then I just come
riding up ripped.

14:04.777 --> 14:06.346
It's a good thing we
got that sauna, right?

14:06.379 --> 14:07.580
Yeah.

14:07.614 --> 14:10.550
Course, I'm also gonna
get a beard trimmer,

14:10.583 --> 14:12.785
and take care of
all my downstairs...

14:21.294 --> 14:22.829
So...

14:22.862 --> 14:24.932
how was everyone's day?

14:24.965 --> 14:26.099
Awesome.

14:26.133 --> 14:27.935
My cousin violated
his parole,

14:27.968 --> 14:30.170
which in and of itself
isn't good news,

14:30.203 --> 14:32.872
but we're gonna get his
van until he gets out.

14:32.906 --> 14:34.441
I'm thinking we just stick
a giant-ass decal

14:34.474 --> 14:35.675
right on the side of it.

14:35.708 --> 14:36.876
Dude, great idea!

14:36.910 --> 14:38.511
It's gonna be like
a mobile billboard.

14:38.545 --> 14:40.013
Boom.

14:40.047 --> 14:41.181
SABRINA:
Well,

14:41.214 --> 14:42.615
it'll still be a van.

14:42.649 --> 14:44.117
Babe, I am...

14:44.151 --> 14:45.953
I'm so proud of you.
It's so exciting.

14:45.986 --> 14:47.887
Just don't get your hopes up,
you know?

14:47.921 --> 14:49.957
What do you mean?

14:49.990 --> 14:52.059
Mm, handyman service?

14:52.092 --> 14:54.261
It's not exactly
a groundbreaking idea.

14:54.294 --> 14:56.229
How much money
can you really make?

14:56.263 --> 14:58.431
A lot.
YULIA:
I see same thing

14:58.465 --> 15:00.500
with street girls
in my country.

15:01.501 --> 15:03.536
So many risks;
too small money.

15:03.570 --> 15:05.138
Yeah. This girl gets it.

15:05.172 --> 15:06.706
Who are you again?

15:06.739 --> 15:08.108
Wha... She's my girlfriend.

15:08.141 --> 15:10.110
Why does everyone
keep questioning that?

15:10.143 --> 15:13.080
Yeah, everyone can see
that she is his girlfriend.

15:13.113 --> 15:15.382
YULIA:
Why don't you put on
a Web show instead?

15:15.415 --> 15:18.285
That way you can has many
customers all at once,

15:18.318 --> 15:19.987
and you also not get hurt.

15:20.020 --> 15:22.555
That's brilliant.
Jimmy, did you hear that?
Yeah.

15:22.589 --> 15:23.656
So smart, babe.

15:23.690 --> 15:25.058
(chuckling):
Yeah, totally. You know what?

15:25.092 --> 15:26.926
I'm just gonna come right out
and ask it.

15:26.960 --> 15:28.495
Yulia, what are
your intentions here?

15:28.528 --> 15:30.130
Oh, Chip invited me.

15:30.163 --> 15:32.165
No, no, I know. That wasn't
the question, was it?

15:32.199 --> 15:34.434
I'm wondering,
what is a wolf like you

15:34.467 --> 15:36.303
doing with a sheep like Chip?

15:36.336 --> 15:39.172
No, Yulia, you do not have
to answer that question.

15:39.206 --> 15:41.608
Is okay.

15:42.942 --> 15:45.245
I like Chip because
he's sheep.

15:45.278 --> 15:47.314
Huh?

15:49.482 --> 15:51.684
Sheep are good.
They're soft.

15:51.718 --> 15:53.520
A sheep will
never hurt me.

15:53.553 --> 15:55.122
In Soviet times,

15:55.155 --> 15:56.423
my papa was
turned into,

15:56.456 --> 15:58.425
um... how you call?

15:58.458 --> 16:00.127
Drinking cripple.

16:00.160 --> 16:01.161
Alcoholic.

16:01.194 --> 16:02.162
He was not very gentle

16:02.195 --> 16:03.363
to my mother.

16:03.396 --> 16:04.831
So to help my mother,

16:04.864 --> 16:06.833
I had to, um...

16:08.401 --> 16:11.238
...I had to do a lot of things
to survive.

16:12.372 --> 16:14.341
Life has not been easy for me.

16:14.374 --> 16:15.542
(softly): Hey.

16:15.575 --> 16:17.777
We've all had to do
things to survive.

16:17.810 --> 16:20.113
Stop. Stop.
You see what you did?

16:20.147 --> 16:21.548
Now she's
all upset.

16:21.581 --> 16:25.018
Come on, Yulia,
you don't have to take this.

16:29.322 --> 16:30.390
I like her.

16:30.423 --> 16:31.691
She has great ideas.

16:31.724 --> 16:32.925
(inhales)

16:34.494 --> 16:36.296
(inhales)

16:36.329 --> 16:37.330
Whoa.

16:37.364 --> 16:38.531
(sniffs)
Hey.

16:38.565 --> 16:39.899
Uh, we're getting gas,

16:39.932 --> 16:42.235
'cause we're going
to the hardware store tomorrow.

16:42.269 --> 16:45.372
Cool. So, about Stud Nailers,
I need you to stop it.

16:45.405 --> 16:47.140
You want us to stop
our business?

16:47.174 --> 16:49.242
That, your friendship,
everything.

16:49.276 --> 16:51.411
I don't want you hanging out
with Kai anymore.

16:51.444 --> 16:53.580
Why?
Because I want him
to have a chance,

16:53.613 --> 16:56.383
and if he keeps hanging out
with you, that won't happen.

16:56.416 --> 16:57.850
You ruined
your chance.

16:57.884 --> 16:59.352
Your life is
dark and depressing.

16:59.386 --> 17:01.688
Okay, you know, Sabrina,
by the tone of your voice,

17:01.721 --> 17:03.990
I can tell you're about to say
something pretty hurtful.

17:04.023 --> 17:06.426
Were you not just listening?
I said something hurtful.

17:06.459 --> 17:08.161
Your life is sad.

17:08.195 --> 17:10.897
I don't want you around
Kai anymore, okay?

17:10.930 --> 17:13.433
Look, listen, sweetheart,

17:13.466 --> 17:15.335
if you think I'm gonna
throw away a friendship

17:15.368 --> 17:17.237
for a little bit of cash
in my pocket...

17:17.270 --> 17:18.371
How's $2,000?

17:18.405 --> 17:19.906
That's a lot more
than I thought...

17:20.940 --> 17:23.243
He can't know
it was my idea.

17:23.276 --> 17:24.744
Got it?

17:25.745 --> 17:27.147
Fine.

17:34.887 --> 17:37.056
Okay, we've got
Sabrina's laptop...
Mm-hmm.

17:37.090 --> 17:38.291
Chip's Rolex,
Mm-hmm.

17:38.325 --> 17:40.026
Ben's Sandy Koufax ball,

17:40.059 --> 17:42.429
okay, my... flannel.
Oh, good.

17:42.462 --> 17:44.864
We need something of yours.
Let me get that necklace.
Uh...

17:44.897 --> 17:46.199
Mm, uh, no.

17:46.233 --> 17:48.735
My abuelita gave this to me
when I was five.

17:48.768 --> 17:50.803
Alba, we each need
to put something in the bag,

17:50.837 --> 17:52.139
or it's gonna look shady, okay?

17:52.172 --> 17:54.774
Oh, I don't know about this.

17:54.807 --> 17:56.709
We're just speeding up
the inevitable.

17:56.743 --> 17:57.777
Oh...
If a crooked cop

17:57.810 --> 17:59.812
plants drugs
on a guilty suspect,

17:59.846 --> 18:01.648
the suspect's
still guilty, right?

18:01.681 --> 18:02.815
What kind of drugs?

18:02.849 --> 18:04.584
What kind...
A-Are you serious?

18:04.617 --> 18:06.052
I don't know, Alba.
What kind of drugs

18:06.085 --> 18:08.288
do you need it to be in order
to give me the necklace?

18:08.321 --> 18:09.789
Coke?
Coke!

18:09.822 --> 18:11.391
It's coke. Thank you.

18:11.424 --> 18:13.393
You're driving me nuts.
(groans)

18:13.426 --> 18:15.328
All right, we wake up
in a few hours...
Mm-hmm.

18:15.362 --> 18:16.729
...say we've been robbed,

18:16.763 --> 18:18.498
find all of our crap
in Yulia's bag,

18:18.531 --> 18:19.999
and Chip will
finally see her

18:20.032 --> 18:21.834
for the dishonest
tramp that she is.

18:21.868 --> 18:23.870
That's good.
It's gonna be so fun.

18:25.772 --> 18:28.074
(rattling door)

18:28.107 --> 18:29.609
(exhales)

18:30.643 --> 18:32.612
Hey! There he is.

18:32.645 --> 18:34.314
Pop those jeans off.

18:34.347 --> 18:35.782
Start sweating.

18:35.815 --> 18:38.851
I'm not here
to sweat with you, Kai.

18:38.885 --> 18:40.019
You're not?

18:40.052 --> 18:42.522
No, I'm not.

18:42.555 --> 18:44.891
Not today or ever again.

18:45.958 --> 18:48.127
I don't understand.

18:48.161 --> 18:52.532
Well, I've been doing
some thinking, and, uh...

18:52.565 --> 18:55.202
I think Stud Nailers is dumb,

18:55.235 --> 18:57.537
and I think you're dumb.

18:57.570 --> 18:59.872
But I thought
we were friends.

18:59.906 --> 19:02.409
Yeah, that's 'cause
you're a dumb guy, Kai.

19:03.710 --> 19:05.178
So don't try and contact me

19:05.212 --> 19:07.680
or come win me back
or just, you know...

19:07.714 --> 19:10.550
Just leave me alone,
all right?

19:10.583 --> 19:12.519
(rattling door)

19:12.552 --> 19:15.021
You got to jiggle it.
I know I have to jiggle it.

19:15.054 --> 19:16.723
(strained grunting)

19:20.427 --> 19:21.894
(exhales)

19:21.928 --> 19:24.831
(whispers):
Oh, my God,
I'm so sorry.

19:25.832 --> 19:27.133
Oh, good morning,
Romeo.

19:27.166 --> 19:28.701
How'd you sleep?

19:28.735 --> 19:30.903
Fine.
Mickey, we have a problem.

19:30.937 --> 19:32.672
We have been robbed!

19:32.705 --> 19:34.574
What?!
Yeah. Who in the entire world

19:34.607 --> 19:37.244
could do something like this?
It could be anyone-- Yuli...

19:37.277 --> 19:38.645
Somebody stole
my laptop.

19:38.678 --> 19:40.247
Somebody stole my baseball!
Oh...

19:40.280 --> 19:41.981
I can't find my boots.

19:42.014 --> 19:43.983
What? All right, all right,
everybody just settle down.

19:44.016 --> 19:45.985
We'll get
to the bottom of this.

19:46.018 --> 19:47.754
Hey, Chip, where's Yulia?
Whoa.

19:47.787 --> 19:49.589
Probably somewhere
over the Atlantic.

19:49.622 --> 19:50.623
Huh?
ALBA:
Wha...?

19:51.591 --> 19:52.559
I dumped her.

19:52.592 --> 19:53.760
What? Why?

19:53.793 --> 19:55.662
She totally emasculated me
last night at dinner.

19:55.695 --> 19:57.964
I can't be with somebody
who thinks I'm a sheep.

19:59.266 --> 20:00.667
That necklace

20:00.700 --> 20:02.335
has been in my family
for generations.

20:02.369 --> 20:04.103
Damn it, Chip,
My mother had...

20:04.136 --> 20:08.174
(several shouting at once)

20:08.207 --> 20:11.844
Everyone, calm down!

20:11.878 --> 20:14.213
Relax, okay?
I'll explain what happened.

20:16.649 --> 20:18.785
(sighs) What happened is
that you got played

20:18.818 --> 20:21.654
just exactly like I told you
you were going to. (chuckles)

20:22.722 --> 20:25.091
I feel so stupid.
Yeah. Yeah.

20:25.124 --> 20:27.294
You know why?
'Cause you are stupid.

20:27.327 --> 20:29.962
Here I am, spewing information,
life skills all over you.

20:29.996 --> 20:32.098
And what do you do?
You just swat 'em away!

20:32.131 --> 20:33.900
You swat every single one
of them away,

20:33.933 --> 20:35.768
and then you're all confused
about what happened?

20:35.802 --> 20:37.103
Oh, you stupid child.

20:37.136 --> 20:39.906
You know, I... I think
the real lesson here

20:39.939 --> 20:42.809
is that it's easy to brand
all adult entertainers

20:42.842 --> 20:45.077
as untrustworthy crooks.

20:45.111 --> 20:46.913
But if you really want
to know the truth,

20:46.946 --> 20:49.148
it's women in general
that cannot be trusted.

20:49.181 --> 20:51.651
(scoffs)
You're one to talk. Thief.

20:51.684 --> 20:52.985
What?

20:53.019 --> 20:54.654
Kai didn't come to bed
last night, okay?

20:54.687 --> 20:56.323
I know you
didn't break up with him.

20:56.356 --> 20:58.591
Yeah, I did,
last night in the sauna.

20:58.625 --> 21:00.460
What is that smell?
You guys smell that?

21:03.029 --> 21:05.164
(grunts): Oh, ah,
careful, now.

21:05.197 --> 21:07.600
The door was
so warped,

21:07.634 --> 21:09.336
there was just
no escape.

21:09.369 --> 21:10.670
I apologize.

21:10.703 --> 21:11.971
(loud thump)
EMT: Watch it!

21:12.004 --> 21:13.172
Oh, God.

21:13.205 --> 21:14.507
Low step.

21:14.541 --> 21:16.509
Come on.

21:16.543 --> 21:19.912
Look, Sabrina,
I am so sorry.

21:19.946 --> 21:21.314
(grunts)

21:21.348 --> 21:24.016
Ai, that sauna took
the wrong Jimmy.

21:24.050 --> 21:25.352
Yeah.

21:25.385 --> 21:27.454
Well, you know,

21:27.487 --> 21:29.522
he really should have
fixed that door.

21:36.529 --> 21:37.964
JIMMY:
Kung Pao. (laughs)
