00:00.242 --> 00:01.938
Previously on <i>Warehouse 13...</i>

00:01.972 --> 00:05.074
You came into my house
and stole from me,

00:05.109 --> 00:07.176
and I will respond in kind.

00:07.211 --> 00:12.447
Gone! Someone is undoing
my life's work!

00:12.482 --> 00:14.576
- They're all here.
- [Sighs]

00:14.611 --> 00:15.878
Artie?

00:15.913 --> 00:17.710
I'm not sure
this is everything.

00:17.745 --> 00:20.345
Those are shipping supplies.

00:20.379 --> 00:22.444
Ow!

00:22.478 --> 00:23.745
God, what now?

00:23.779 --> 00:25.582
Yeah, we gotta get
you off that metronome.

00:25.616 --> 00:26.584
I don't know
if it's possible.

00:26.619 --> 00:28.753
You, sir, owe me a dinner.

00:28.788 --> 00:31.158
A very nice dinner.

00:37.439 --> 00:40.109
Steve!
How is the research coming?

00:40.144 --> 00:42.580
[Sighs] I'm only halfway
through the "A"s.

00:42.614 --> 00:45.285
Do you have any idea how huge
the Warehouse database is?

00:45.319 --> 00:46.520
No. Tell me.

00:46.554 --> 00:48.522
You could have just said,
"stupid question."

00:48.556 --> 00:50.358
Stupid question.

00:50.392 --> 00:53.229
Well, you know
who could help you, though?

00:53.263 --> 00:54.630
Tech-savvy girl.

00:54.665 --> 00:56.900
Maybe with a bit of punk rock
flair, and a bit of goth.

00:56.934 --> 00:59.538
Artie, if Claudia finds out
that I'm looking to disconnect

00:59.573 --> 01:01.040
myself from the metronome,
she'll just try and stop me,

01:01.074 --> 01:02.975
'cause it's dangerous.

01:03.009 --> 01:04.444
Oh, yes, of course.

01:04.477 --> 01:05.646
Yeah.

01:05.680 --> 01:08.683
She'd probably find
a way to blame me, too.

01:08.718 --> 01:11.754
Hey, look at me.

01:11.788 --> 01:13.557
When's the last time
you slept?

01:13.591 --> 01:16.661
Right after I died.
How am I supposed to sleep?

01:16.695 --> 01:18.630
As long as Claudia feels
any pain that I do,

01:18.664 --> 01:20.865
I'm gonna be
a little stressed out.

01:20.900 --> 01:22.834
It's not fair that she's being
punished for saving my life.

01:22.869 --> 01:24.837
Artifacts are not fair.

01:24.872 --> 01:26.640
All right, off I go.

01:26.674 --> 01:28.108
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

01:28.142 --> 01:30.144
I'll dive right into this with
you as soon as I am back,

01:30.178 --> 01:32.013
and we will find something.
All right?

01:32.047 --> 01:33.149
Okay.

01:33.183 --> 01:34.817
Artie-o, Artie-o.

01:34.852 --> 01:37.119
Wherefore art thou, Artie-o?

01:37.154 --> 01:41.058
But soft, what light through
yon umbilicus breaks?

01:41.092 --> 01:44.095
It is the east,
and Dr. Vaness-iet is the sun.

01:44.129 --> 01:47.465
Arise, fair sun,
and kill the envious moon--

01:47.500 --> 01:48.466
Kill?
Yeah, there's a thought.

01:48.501 --> 01:50.836
- Hey, is this new?
- No.

01:50.870 --> 01:52.505
Oh, come on.
I think it's so cute

01:52.539 --> 01:53.973
you officially have
a girlfriend.

01:54.008 --> 01:56.342
- She's not my girlfriend.
- Are you seeing anyone else?

01:56.377 --> 01:57.677
- No.
- Do you want to?

01:57.712 --> 01:59.179
- No.
- She's your girlfriend.

01:59.213 --> 02:01.681
Both: Ooh!
[Dog barks]

02:01.716 --> 02:03.150
I haven't had a girlfriend
since Nixon left office.

02:03.185 --> 02:05.653
Oh, well, get thee hence.
Go forth and procreate.

02:05.687 --> 02:08.890
Oh, yes, that's what
we want, children.

02:08.925 --> 02:10.092
Wait!

02:10.126 --> 02:11.093
Where are Pete and Myka?

02:11.127 --> 02:12.161
I gave them an assignment.

02:12.195 --> 02:13.296
What assignment?

02:13.330 --> 02:14.531
We've been ping-less
for 48 hours.

02:14.565 --> 02:15.632
It's a Warehouse record.
Where are they?

02:15.666 --> 02:17.100
What are you keeping from me?
Spill.

02:17.134 --> 02:19.837
Oh, lord, why in your wisdom
did you send me such a noodge?

02:19.871 --> 02:22.573
Karma.
That is new, isn't it?

02:22.607 --> 02:24.408
No!
[Dog whines]

02:24.443 --> 02:26.744
- Et voila, monsieur.
- Oh!

02:26.778 --> 02:28.846
You found it!
Is it the right one?

02:28.880 --> 02:32.216
Make, model, and year,
as requested.

02:32.250 --> 02:34.117
Oh, yeah, I don't even want to
know what kind of jingle bells

02:34.152 --> 02:36.019
- kinks you two kids are into.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

02:36.054 --> 02:37.220
It's a gift--
[Ding]

02:37.255 --> 02:38.221
Not an artifact.

02:38.256 --> 02:40.390
And furthermore,
show of hands.

02:40.424 --> 02:43.193
Who here, in this room,
is not single?

02:43.227 --> 02:45.229
- I rest my case.
- So you do have a girlfriend.

02:45.263 --> 02:46.597
All: Ooh!

02:46.631 --> 02:48.299
[Dog barks]

02:48.333 --> 02:49.967
A little advice.

02:50.002 --> 02:52.170
Things have been
going rather well,

02:52.204 --> 02:55.207
and I've been considering asking
Vanessa for a more...

02:55.241 --> 02:57.309
geographical commitment.

02:57.344 --> 02:59.645
What, you mean, like,
move in together?

02:59.679 --> 03:01.314
[Dog whines]
Here?

03:01.348 --> 03:04.251
Or in Univille,
the Paris of the badlands?

03:04.285 --> 03:06.853
- Who wouldn't want to live there?
- Ooh, good point.

03:06.888 --> 03:08.989
Yes, perhaps a pied-a-terre
in featherhead is

03:09.023 --> 03:10.591
more the ticket.

03:10.625 --> 03:12.159
It's just I don't know
if the timing is right.

03:12.193 --> 03:14.528
I think it's a great idea,
Artie.

03:14.562 --> 03:16.397
- You do?
- Yeah.

03:16.431 --> 03:18.065
- Thank you.
- Is this new?

03:18.099 --> 03:19.334
- Yes.
- It's lovely.

03:19.368 --> 03:20.902
Thanks. Speaking of timing,
I'm late.

03:20.936 --> 03:24.139
All right, if you need me
for any reason whatsoever,

03:24.173 --> 03:25.840
you call me--
only if it's important.

03:25.875 --> 03:27.710
Artie, would you
just relax, okay?

03:27.744 --> 03:29.278
- We're old pros.
- Yeah, go.

03:29.312 --> 03:30.279
Have a great weekend.

03:30.313 --> 03:33.382
Yes, I--
I intend to.

03:33.417 --> 03:35.084
I'll try.

03:35.119 --> 03:36.886
Don't be yourself.

03:36.921 --> 03:38.722
[Dog barks]

03:43.128 --> 03:44.395
$300?

03:44.429 --> 03:46.764
Not bad for an impromptu
clothing drive.

03:46.798 --> 03:48.299
Thanks to you,
Kristen.

03:48.333 --> 03:50.801
All I did was tweet
about it.

03:50.836 --> 03:52.604
You're too modest.

03:52.638 --> 03:54.873
Oh, that reminds me,
father,

03:54.907 --> 03:56.842
uh, Mrs. Thompson was
looking for pieces

03:56.876 --> 03:58.143
for a bedroom set.

03:58.177 --> 04:00.145
Someone just donated
a dressing mirror, I think.

04:00.180 --> 04:02.114
I remember the package.
I'll go.

Oh, goodness! Oh...

Hello?

04:52.034 --> 04:54.969

Is someone there?

04:55.003 --> 04:59.406
Help me.
Please, help me!

05:16.691 --> 05:19.894
[Giggles]

05:25.200 --> 05:30.637
Tell me, father...

05:30.671 --> 05:32.806
Where can I find L'Etoile?

05:32.840 --> 05:34.808
- What?
- What?

05:34.842 --> 05:36.877
- I--I don't know--
- You don't know.

05:36.911 --> 05:39.046
- I don't know--what?
- L'Etoile.

05:39.080 --> 05:40.314
I don't know what--

05:40.348 --> 05:42.816
Well, maybe this will jog
your memory.

05:42.851 --> 05:46.053
Mmmmmm... ha!

05:46.087 --> 05:48.789
Damn, they'll be here soon.
I mustn't me late.

05:48.823 --> 05:50.858
L'Etoile. Where is it?

05:50.892 --> 05:52.092
Kristen. Kristen!

05:52.127 --> 05:54.428
What the devil
has gotten into you?

05:54.462 --> 05:56.864
[Giggles]
Not the devil.

05:56.898 --> 05:58.532
Oh!

[Giggles]

06:11.913 --> 06:13.880

Let me out of here,
you bastards!

06:54.691 --> 06:56.459
She's such a sweet
young lady.

06:56.493 --> 06:58.560
I've never seen her
like that.

06:58.595 --> 07:00.295
It's like she's possessed.

07:00.330 --> 07:01.963
Yeah, well,
she does kinda have

07:01.998 --> 07:03.965
that whole Linda Blair
head-spinning thing

07:03.999 --> 07:05.033
going on there.

07:05.067 --> 07:06.167
What's wrong with her?

07:06.201 --> 07:07.935
Father, has Kristen
come into contact

07:07.970 --> 07:10.572
with any old
or unusual objects lately?

07:10.606 --> 07:12.407
We work in a thrift store.

07:12.442 --> 07:16.278
I will kill
every one of you!

07:16.312 --> 07:17.446
She doesn't mean that.

07:17.480 --> 07:20.782
Well, this should be
a fun interview.

07:22.718 --> 07:25.820
- Hi.
- Hello, Kristen.

07:25.855 --> 07:29.157
- I'm, uh--
- Myka Bering.

07:29.191 --> 07:32.093

Terrific.

07:36.899 --> 07:38.599
Kristen, we think
that you may have

07:38.634 --> 07:40.802
come into contact
with something that's

07:40.836 --> 07:42.269
altered you.

07:42.304 --> 07:43.938
When, exactly, did you--

07:43.972 --> 07:45.272
You should wear
tighter clothes, Pete.

07:45.306 --> 07:47.174
- You're lookin' <i>hot!</i>
- Really?

07:47.208 --> 07:49.043
'Cause I do a thousand crunches,
and I'm just, like, oh--

07:49.077 --> 07:50.978
- Pete!

07:51.012 --> 07:53.213
Do you--do you remember
touching something

07:53.247 --> 07:56.183
that perhaps you shouldn't
have--have touched?

07:56.217 --> 07:57.885
I know what I'd like
to touch.

07:57.919 --> 08:01.454
[Knuckles crack]
Aah! Ow!

08:01.489 --> 08:03.623

let's go check out

Yeah.

[Breathes, sniffs]

08:41.895 --> 08:43.328
Okay.

08:43.364 --> 08:45.498
[Zips up zipper]
Ahh.

08:45.533 --> 08:48.869
Once more into the breach.

08:56.144 --> 08:57.278
Wow.

08:57.312 --> 09:00.647
Just the reaction
I was hoping for.

09:00.681 --> 09:02.748
- Hi.
- Hi.

09:02.782 --> 09:03.749
Mm.

09:03.783 --> 09:06.717
- Hi.
- Hi.

09:09.053 --> 09:11.653
So I need
just one more minute.

09:11.688 --> 09:13.421
Relax.
Make yourself comfortable.

09:13.456 --> 09:15.023
And I like that jacket.

09:15.057 --> 09:17.524
What, this old thing?

09:19.927 --> 09:21.327
Did you find
someplace interesting?

09:21.362 --> 09:23.696
Only the finest, most
romantic restaurant in town.

09:23.731 --> 09:26.332
Granted, we don't set the bar
very high around here.

09:26.366 --> 09:28.101
Well, it's the company
that matters.

09:28.135 --> 09:30.269
I couldn't ask
for better.

09:30.303 --> 09:35.206
Whoa.
[Chuckles]

09:35.241 --> 09:36.908

- Oh, yes.

09:40.812 --> 09:43.880
[Footsteps]

09:54.757 --> 09:56.825
Not gonna let it go,
are you?

09:56.859 --> 09:58.459
Oh, you know me
so well.

09:58.494 --> 10:00.928
You know, you and I could have
totally solved the case

10:00.962 --> 10:02.329
of church girl gone wild,
but no--

10:02.364 --> 10:04.532
Jinksy had to be all,
"You know--you know what?

10:04.566 --> 10:06.566
I think we should let Pete
and Myka handle this one."

10:06.601 --> 10:08.601
That is absolutely me.
Do Nicholson!

action and adventure.

- What are you hiding?
- I'm not hiding.

10:17.372 --> 10:19.640
Look, we've been
through a lot.

10:19.674 --> 10:21.574
I think that we should
just take it easy...

10:21.609 --> 10:22.675
for a while...

10:22.710 --> 10:25.177
- Both of us.
- Really?

10:25.212 --> 10:26.779
Who died and made you boss
of me?

10:26.813 --> 10:29.411
Uh, I did.

10:29.446 --> 10:31.980
Well, what, are you...
afraid of dying again?

10:32.015 --> 10:34.516
You know you can't die,
right?

10:34.550 --> 10:38.219
That's not what
I'm afraid of, Claude.

10:38.253 --> 10:39.587
Trust me.

10:50.129 --> 10:52.930
[Static-bagging items]

11:03.707 --> 11:05.942
Anything sparking?

11:05.976 --> 11:08.277
No. You know,
unfortunately,

11:08.311 --> 11:09.811
my mother would love
this place.

11:09.846 --> 11:12.047
- Eww.
- You?

11:12.081 --> 11:16.117
Nope. I mean, look,
we could be here all night.

11:19.754 --> 11:22.790
Maybe not.

11:22.824 --> 11:25.359
Pete?

11:36.003 --> 11:39.038
Spooky.

11:39.072 --> 11:41.306
Blood.

11:43.109 --> 11:44.743
Blood, blood.

11:44.777 --> 11:48.780
Blood.
Blood, blood, blood.

11:48.815 --> 11:50.982
Hmm.

11:51.017 --> 11:53.819
Well, if you say so.

11:53.853 --> 11:54.987
Aah! Sh--

11:55.021 --> 11:57.890
"Click me", huh?
Click you!

11:57.924 --> 12:00.893
Pete this is--
this is mirror glass.

12:00.927 --> 12:03.028
What?

12:03.063 --> 12:05.698
Would you help me with this
for a second?

12:08.435 --> 12:10.869
- Okay.
- [Straining]

12:15.375 --> 12:17.376
- It's funny,
this almost looks like--

12:17.411 --> 12:20.713
- It is.

12:20.747 --> 12:22.381
Oh, my God, the mirror!

12:30.389 --> 12:32.790
Aah!

12:32.825 --> 12:37.194
No, we--we locked this
in the Dark Vault <i>years</i> ago.

12:37.229 --> 12:40.097
Aw, come on, man!
Artifacts can walk now?

12:40.132 --> 12:42.133
Pete, do you remember
the rule of the mirror?

12:42.167 --> 12:46.236
Yeah, uh, nothing comes out
unless something goes in.

12:46.271 --> 12:49.706
Oh, snap, that wasn't Kristen
at the hospital!

12:49.740 --> 12:51.508
It was Alice Liddell.

12:51.543 --> 12:54.711
She's free... again.

13:00.620 --> 13:03.222
Hi, handsome.

13:03.256 --> 13:05.290
You from around here?

13:05.325 --> 13:08.093
[Chuckles]
Born and raised.

13:08.128 --> 13:11.297
Ooh. Then you must know
where I can find L'Etoile.

13:11.332 --> 13:13.833
Yeah, sure.
It's over at 6th and State.

13:13.868 --> 13:15.402
It's a short drive
from here.

13:15.436 --> 13:17.571
[Chuckles]
6th and State.

13:20.642 --> 13:23.076
Ooh...
[Sighs]

13:23.111 --> 13:25.979
My hand is numb.
Is that okay?

13:26.013 --> 13:28.348
It might--
it might be too tight.

13:28.382 --> 13:30.584
The--the strap.

13:30.618 --> 13:32.419
Is it, um--
is it tingling?

13:32.453 --> 13:36.490
It was, and now
I can't feel anything at all.

13:36.524 --> 13:39.826
Well...

13:39.861 --> 13:41.328
Eleanor does have
a tendency to go

13:41.362 --> 13:43.564
a little too tight
with these.

13:43.598 --> 13:45.599
Crazy woman thinks she runs
this place half the time.

13:45.634 --> 13:47.701
[Moans]

13:47.735 --> 13:50.704
Feels so good.

13:50.738 --> 13:53.806
Mmm...

[Distorted voice]
We're all mad here.

14:00.447 --> 14:03.348
Shh.

14:03.383 --> 14:05.484
Unh!

14:12.726 --> 14:16.498
6th and State.

14:23.587 --> 14:26.422
All Alice ever wanted was
to be free of the Warehouse.

14:26.456 --> 14:28.757
It looks like the little
lunatic got her wish.

14:28.792 --> 14:30.326
She gets out of here,
she's gonna run.

14:30.360 --> 14:32.395
We could lose her
forever.

14:35.232 --> 14:36.766
Hey, where is she?

14:36.800 --> 14:38.034
Where's the girl?
She's dangerous.

14:38.068 --> 14:40.269
- I know.
- Dude!

14:40.304 --> 14:42.005
She smashed my face
and took off.

14:42.039 --> 14:44.607
Secret Service. I need you
to shut down this hospital now.

14:44.642 --> 14:46.242
No one gets in or out--
you got me?

14:46.277 --> 14:48.111
- Yeah, but--
- Just go!

14:48.145 --> 14:50.213
Why don't women like me?

14:52.717 --> 14:54.251
Pete, we just need
to get inside her head.

14:54.285 --> 14:55.685
You know, figure out
her next move.

14:55.720 --> 14:58.021
I'm not sure
"psychopathic nut job"

14:58.055 --> 14:59.188
is in my wheelhouse.

14:59.223 --> 15:01.157
Deep down,
she's still a little girl.

15:01.191 --> 15:02.925
We just need to think
like a child.

15:02.959 --> 15:05.794
Okay, now,
that's in my wheelhouse.

15:05.829 --> 15:09.031
If I'd just escaped
from my magic-mirror prison,

15:09.065 --> 15:11.967
I'd want to get as far away
from the two of us as possible.

15:12.001 --> 15:16.305
- Where would I go?
- Pete.

15:16.339 --> 15:19.708
I really need to start
looking down.

15:19.743 --> 15:21.944
Pete, she went this way.

15:23.513 --> 15:25.147
Alice, hands where we can
see 'em!

15:25.182 --> 15:27.483
[Gasps]
Alice? Who's Alice?

15:27.517 --> 15:29.718
Knock it off, Wonderland.
We know you're in there.

15:29.752 --> 15:31.753
Who are you people?

15:31.788 --> 15:33.455
Where's... father Mitchell?

15:33.489 --> 15:35.056
Is this a hospital?

15:35.091 --> 15:38.093
Pete, Alice wouldn't know
who father Mitchell is.

15:38.127 --> 15:40.128
Okay, all right.

15:40.162 --> 15:43.064
Come on. There you go.

15:43.098 --> 15:45.432
What's the last thing
you remember?

15:45.467 --> 15:47.935
I was in the stockroom
unwrapping this mirror

15:47.969 --> 15:51.973
that came in, and then...
a bright flash of light.

15:52.007 --> 15:54.409
- And then--
- Nothing.

15:54.443 --> 15:56.010
Yeah.

15:56.045 --> 15:58.813
Like the whole world
just disappeared,

15:58.848 --> 16:02.784
and all that was left
was cold and darkness and--

16:02.819 --> 16:07.289
- And silence.
- Yeah.

16:07.323 --> 16:12.028
It was horrible.
I never felt so alone.

16:12.062 --> 16:14.464
It's okay.

16:16.300 --> 16:19.435
What was that?

16:19.470 --> 16:21.170
Pete, that's exactly
how I felt

16:21.205 --> 16:23.239
when I was trapped
in Lewis Carroll's mirror

16:23.273 --> 16:25.074
that's not Alice.

16:25.109 --> 16:28.411
- Then where is she?
- If I had to guess...

16:28.446 --> 16:29.680
She's inside someone else.

16:29.714 --> 16:31.081
Wait, wait,
somebody else?

16:31.115 --> 16:33.250
Do you think she's figured out
how to jump bodies?

16:33.284 --> 16:34.985
I don't know,
but if she has,

16:35.019 --> 16:37.655
I mean,
she could be anyone.

16:37.689 --> 16:40.291
Hey, where's my ambulance?

16:40.326 --> 16:41.927
[Siren blaring]

16:41.961 --> 16:43.629
[Tires screech]

16:43.663 --> 16:46.598
And she's mobile.

16:46.632 --> 16:47.833
I tracked here heading
due south

16:47.867 --> 16:49.268
a few miles
from your location.

16:49.302 --> 16:51.937
Uploading the coordinates
to the Highlander's GPS now.

16:51.971 --> 16:54.239
Wherever that ambulance goes,
you'll be able to find it.

16:54.274 --> 16:55.874
Awesome. Thanks, Claude.

16:55.909 --> 16:58.310
The mirror's destroyed, so
you guys need to find something

16:58.344 --> 16:59.945
to extract and contain Alice.

16:59.979 --> 17:01.112
Aye, captain.

17:01.147 --> 17:02.814
- Spock and Uhura out.
- Thanks.

17:02.848 --> 17:04.147
I like it
when I get to be Spock.

17:04.183 --> 17:05.683
Oh, you're hilarious.

17:05.717 --> 17:07.885
Okay, now, I really want
to understand this.

17:07.920 --> 17:10.654
<i>Alice In Wonderland</i> is
actually a real account

17:10.689 --> 17:12.522
of a homicidal maniac
trapped in a mirror

17:12.557 --> 17:13.723
that we have in the Warehouse?

17:13.758 --> 17:15.159
<i>Had.</i>
Which is totally freaky.

17:15.193 --> 17:16.226
That thing was
locked down tight.

17:16.261 --> 17:17.361
Okay, two jobs.

17:17.395 --> 17:19.262
One, find a containment
artifact for Alice,

17:19.296 --> 17:22.832
and two, figure out
how that mirror got out.

17:28.838 --> 17:31.106
Paging Leena.
Please retreat the Dodgson file

17:31.141 --> 17:34.009
and meet your party
in the Dark Vault.

17:34.043 --> 17:37.045
[Whoosh of suction, clattering]

17:37.079 --> 17:38.546
I made that.

17:44.419 --> 17:46.821
Sylvia Plath's typewriter can
suck the life out of a person.

17:46.855 --> 17:48.656
Don't get too close.

17:48.690 --> 17:50.792
Yeah, that'll slow her down,
but it won't draw her out.

17:50.826 --> 17:52.694
Maybe her escape
had something to do

17:52.728 --> 17:54.629
with the properties
of the mirror?

17:54.663 --> 17:56.131
Could she have found
a way out on her own?

17:56.165 --> 17:57.599
You said she's
pretty resourceful.

17:57.633 --> 17:59.634
Doubtful. It's more likely
the mirror got out first,

17:59.669 --> 18:00.702
not Alice.

18:00.736 --> 18:04.073
Somebody set her free.
Hello.

18:09.547 --> 18:11.548
That's the same thing
Artie and I saw the other day.

18:11.582 --> 18:13.817
Please to 'splain.

18:13.852 --> 18:15.219
You've seen
one of these before?

18:15.253 --> 18:17.321
There was a box of black
diamonds at the storage space.

18:17.355 --> 18:18.790
What storage space?

18:18.824 --> 18:21.392
Where the artifacts
were stored.

18:21.427 --> 18:22.560
What are you talking about?

18:22.595 --> 18:24.830
Artie said
he was gonna tell you.

18:24.864 --> 18:26.498
- Tell me what?
- That someone's been

18:26.533 --> 18:27.900
stealing artifacts
from the Warehouse

18:27.934 --> 18:28.900
and sending them
out into the world.

18:28.935 --> 18:30.969
Okay.
So many questions.

18:31.003 --> 18:32.670
Well, uh,
he wouldn't say much,

18:32.705 --> 18:34.038
but he seemed to know
who it was,

18:34.072 --> 18:35.673
and it's clearly someone
with a serious beef against him.

18:35.707 --> 18:38.408
All right, I'm gonna have
to check the security feeds.

18:38.443 --> 18:40.677
So these are what,
the Pink Panther's calling card?

18:40.712 --> 18:43.513
Where is Lewis Carroll's
mirror?

18:43.547 --> 18:44.614
Gone. Broken.

18:44.649 --> 18:46.282
And Alice is loose
in Rapid City.

18:46.317 --> 18:48.284
So we're looking for a new
and hopefully permanent home

18:48.319 --> 18:49.319
for little Miss Cray-Cray.

Oh, my God.

[Woman's voice cackling]

19:11.378 --> 19:15.647
- Bupkis up front.
- The tire's warm.

19:15.682 --> 19:18.617
Okay, the crash
must've just happened.

19:18.651 --> 19:19.985
She can't have gotten far.

19:20.019 --> 19:22.788
Not without new wheels.

19:22.822 --> 19:24.222
There's nothing.

19:24.257 --> 19:27.826

19:27.861 --> 19:28.828
Bloody hell!

19:28.862 --> 19:30.396
Let's go.

19:30.430 --> 19:32.866

- Hey!
- [Laughing crazily]

19:37.338 --> 19:38.371

19:38.406 --> 19:42.476
I'm you.

19:42.510 --> 19:44.712
[Laughs]

19:44.746 --> 19:46.213
That's how she's been
body jumping.

19:46.248 --> 19:47.548
[Tires screech]

19:47.582 --> 19:49.149
She's got a piece
of the mirror.

Love to stay and play,

19:51.619 --> 19:53.553
[distorted voice] but I have
a very important date.

19:56.757 --> 19:59.491
[Tires screech]

19:59.526 --> 20:01.226
All right,
you put out the flames,

20:01.260 --> 20:04.362
- I'll turn off the gas.
- Okay.

20:20.713 --> 20:21.913
So you still think
she's a little girl?

20:21.948 --> 20:23.782
I think it's time
we called Artie.

20:23.817 --> 20:25.050
Yeah.

20:25.085 --> 20:26.618
They should be done
with dessert.

20:26.653 --> 20:30.289
Okay, it was a--
it was a bicycle

20:30.323 --> 20:32.758
that my father gave me
for my seventh birthday.

20:32.792 --> 20:35.360
And it was all, like,
pinky and shiny.

20:35.395 --> 20:37.462
And it had this cute
little basket on the back of it.

20:37.496 --> 20:39.564
And it had tassels hanging
from the handlebars.

20:39.598 --> 20:41.199
And the only thing
it was missing--

20:41.233 --> 20:44.102
Was a shiny copper bell?

20:44.136 --> 20:46.137
I've told you this story.

20:46.172 --> 20:48.440
Okay, well, that happens
sometimes at this age,

20:48.474 --> 20:50.976
- Mm-hmm.
- Your name's Artie, right?

20:51.010 --> 20:52.878
How--how do I know you?

20:52.912 --> 20:54.713
I could hear you
tell that story 1,000 times

20:54.747 --> 20:57.382
just to see that look
in your eyes

20:57.417 --> 21:00.785
when you tell it.

21:00.820 --> 21:04.923
Vanessa...
I've been thinking.

21:04.957 --> 21:11.563
We have these little
rendezvous once a month...

21:11.597 --> 21:14.766
And maybe we...
should do it more?

21:17.637 --> 21:19.938
I'd like that.

21:19.973 --> 21:22.174
You would?

21:22.209 --> 21:25.244
I have something for you.

21:25.279 --> 21:28.047
It's okay.
It's nothing fancy.

21:28.081 --> 21:32.285
It's just something that
I'm absolutely positive...

21:32.319 --> 21:34.187
- you don't have.
- Ooh.

[Cell phone rings]

21:36.090 --> 21:39.093
Sorry.

All right, Pete,
this better be <i>so</i> important.

21:41.831 --> 21:43.031
Alice Liddell is loose.

21:43.066 --> 21:45.867
Alice.

21:45.902 --> 21:48.136
- Where?
- Rapid City, South Dakota.

21:48.171 --> 21:49.538
Why is she in Rapid City?

21:49.572 --> 21:51.306
'Cause that's where
L'Etoile is,

body-jacked said

21:57.113 --> 22:00.215
she was in a hurry to get
to something called L'Etoile.

22:00.249 --> 22:02.650
And Myka says
it means "star" in French.

22:02.685 --> 22:07.155
Yeah.
It's also a restaurant.

22:07.189 --> 22:08.657
Compliments of the house.

22:23.020 --> 22:24.544
We happen to be
at L'Etoile right now.

22:24.623 --> 22:26.224
I think you should
absolutely join us.

22:26.258 --> 22:31.930
It's got the best tiramisu
in all of South Dakota.

22:31.964 --> 22:34.466
Hurry, before it's 86ed.
[Cell phone beeps off]

22:34.500 --> 22:36.568
Artie?

22:36.602 --> 22:38.770
Uh, you know,
nature calls.

22:38.804 --> 22:42.073
I understand.

22:42.108 --> 22:45.476
So sorry. Somebody look after
that poor girl!

22:45.511 --> 22:47.746
Come on.

22:50.082 --> 22:52.050
Where are the people
from this table?

22:52.084 --> 22:54.153
Where, damn it?

22:54.187 --> 22:56.088
Where, damn it?

22:56.122 --> 22:58.723
[Patrons gasp]

22:58.758 --> 23:00.559
[Fire alarm bell ringing]

23:00.593 --> 23:03.929
[Alarmed murmurs]

23:06.365 --> 23:08.366
This has Alice written
all over it.

23:08.401 --> 23:09.367
[Police siren chirps]

23:09.402 --> 23:12.771
Yeah, we should check
with Artie.

23:12.805 --> 23:15.440
Artie, where are you?

23:15.475 --> 23:19.044
No, uh, turn around.

23:19.078 --> 23:20.045
- Pete.
- Yeah.

23:20.079 --> 23:22.814
Over here. Hey.

23:22.848 --> 23:23.949
So where's Alice?

23:23.983 --> 23:26.551
Alice, well,
inside our waitress.

23:26.585 --> 23:28.253
Probably not anymore.

23:28.287 --> 23:29.954
She's got a new trick
up her sleeve.

23:29.989 --> 23:31.690
Girlfriend can body jump.

23:31.724 --> 23:33.792
Oh, great.

23:33.827 --> 23:35.827
What does she want?
What is she doing here?

23:35.862 --> 23:37.529
Yeah, and how did she
get out of the Warehouse?

23:37.563 --> 23:39.564
Let's not worry
about that now.

23:39.598 --> 23:40.865
Let's just focus on
what is she doing here,

23:40.899 --> 23:42.133
and what does she want?

23:42.167 --> 23:43.367
Well, we thought it was
about her finally being

23:43.401 --> 23:44.635
free of the mirror,

23:44.669 --> 23:46.037
but it doesn't look like
she's on the run.

23:46.071 --> 23:49.040
She's hunting something,
or someone.

23:49.074 --> 23:51.442
Me.

23:51.476 --> 23:55.478
She's hunting me.

23:57.615 --> 24:00.550
Looks like somebody's behind
on inventory in this section.

24:00.585 --> 24:02.018
I figured I'd get to it
sometime before

24:02.053 --> 24:04.054
my 40th birthday.
Save the date.

24:04.088 --> 24:05.923
What exactly
are we looking for?

24:05.957 --> 24:07.691
- This.
- Right, okay.

24:07.726 --> 24:10.093
So the Warehouse agent who wrote
<i>Alice In Wonderland</i>

24:10.128 --> 24:12.028
incorporated artifacts
into the narrative.

24:12.063 --> 24:13.396
Like, the Mad Hatter
is based

24:13.431 --> 24:16.433
on King George III's crown,
which causes madness.

24:16.467 --> 24:18.401
And the Stoner Caterpillar?

24:18.436 --> 24:22.139
It says, "based on
Hakim Abul Fateh Gilani,

24:22.173 --> 24:24.608
"16th century physician
whose hookah could draw

24:24.642 --> 24:26.343
a person's spirit
out of their body and trap it."

24:26.378 --> 24:28.980
Sounds perfect.

24:29.014 --> 24:32.016
Now where is it?

24:36.755 --> 24:38.256
Hey, you guys look here.

24:38.290 --> 24:41.226
I'll check the next aisle.

24:41.261 --> 24:43.229
[Exhales]

24:45.565 --> 24:46.933
Spartacus's retarius.

24:46.967 --> 24:49.035
Rube Goldberg's
wire collection.

24:49.069 --> 24:51.471
Ebenezer Thorndike's
lobster trap.

24:51.505 --> 24:54.807
Hey, is that it?

24:54.841 --> 24:56.508
Where, up at the top?

24:56.543 --> 24:57.810
Yes.

24:57.844 --> 25:01.280
Ugh, come to <i>mamacita.</i>

25:01.314 --> 25:02.614
Uh, Claude, be careful.

25:02.649 --> 25:04.316
None of that stuff
looks like it's nailed down.

25:04.350 --> 25:06.452
Oh, have a little faith.

25:06.486 --> 25:08.187
If I get to the top
of this thing,

25:08.221 --> 25:09.755
I'm naming it Mount Donovan.

25:09.789 --> 25:11.757
[Chuckles]

25:17.363 --> 25:20.699
[Grunts]

25:23.369 --> 25:26.071
[Yelling]
Aah.

25:30.943 --> 25:32.911
[Grunting]
Ow!

25:36.982 --> 25:38.182
What the hell was that?

25:38.217 --> 25:39.484
Claude, are you okay?

25:39.518 --> 25:40.818
Yeah.

25:40.853 --> 25:42.586
Yep, all good, Jinksy.

25:42.621 --> 25:44.522
- You're absolutely sure?
- No, no, I'm fine.

25:44.556 --> 25:48.159
- Do you feel any pain?
- It was just a quick--

25:48.193 --> 25:49.794
Wait.

25:49.828 --> 25:51.662
Did Artie tell you
about my phantom pains?

25:51.697 --> 25:53.464
Yeah. Yeah.

25:53.499 --> 25:56.801
Ugh, that's why you're
being so soft and squishy today.

25:56.835 --> 25:58.402
Are you protecting me?

25:58.437 --> 26:01.205
- Yeah, yeah.
- Oh, silly "wabbit."

26:01.240 --> 26:04.242
Girl wonders
can't be killed.

26:09.648 --> 26:10.781
- Steve?
- Yeah?

26:10.816 --> 26:12.717
What's going on between
you and Claudia?

26:12.751 --> 26:13.851
What? Nothing.

26:13.886 --> 26:15.820
Your auras just swapped
back and forth.

26:15.854 --> 26:17.288
No, they didn't.

26:17.322 --> 26:18.456
I know what I saw.

26:18.490 --> 26:19.890
And I have only ever
seen that once before,

26:19.925 --> 26:22.193
and it didn't end well.

26:22.227 --> 26:24.161
All right,
saddle up, Jinksy.

26:24.196 --> 26:25.830
We'll talk about this later.

26:25.864 --> 26:27.565
Let's go smoke us out
a psychopath.

26:27.599 --> 26:31.001
Takes one to find one.

26:31.036 --> 26:34.004
Be careful.

26:36.841 --> 26:39.710
Okay, Claudia and Steve
are on the way

26:39.744 --> 26:41.278
with the Fateh-Gilani hookah.

26:41.312 --> 26:42.780
And now we have to find Alice.

26:42.814 --> 26:44.381
She could be inside
any of these people.

26:44.415 --> 26:47.317
She's probably still here,
watching us.

26:47.352 --> 26:49.486
I mean, watching you.

26:49.520 --> 26:52.222
All right, look, while
you two play "where's wacko?"--

26:52.256 --> 26:54.791
Myks, do you still have those
sunglasses with the mirrors?

26:54.826 --> 26:56.793
- What?
- Yeah, no, no.

26:56.828 --> 26:58.095
That's excellent.

26:58.129 --> 26:59.530
She'll show up
in the reflection.

26:59.564 --> 27:03.133
Oh, look at you,
having ideas.

27:03.167 --> 27:04.701
I have ideas--

27:04.735 --> 27:08.371
most of them are illegal.

27:08.406 --> 27:10.440
It's so much more exciting
out here in the field, you know?

27:10.474 --> 27:12.809
Yeah. Well, on this date
I was hoping

27:12.844 --> 27:15.845
for an entirely different
kind of excitement.

27:18.249 --> 27:21.818
Hey.
Here we go.

27:21.852 --> 27:23.552
No.

27:23.587 --> 27:25.521
No.

27:25.555 --> 27:28.891
Excuse me, Sparky.

27:28.925 --> 27:30.993
- No.
- No.

27:31.027 --> 27:32.794
- Hello.
- Ladies?

27:32.829 --> 27:34.430
- Hi.
- Hi.

27:34.464 --> 27:36.031
Oh, let's see.

27:36.065 --> 27:37.499
No.

27:37.534 --> 27:38.767
You know, maybe we could--
I don't know,

27:38.802 --> 27:40.769
- do dinner later, or--?
- Pete!

27:40.804 --> 27:43.005
If that mad monk thinks
he can catch me

27:43.039 --> 27:44.306
- with my britches down...
- What?

27:44.340 --> 27:46.909
He's got--what?
Nothing.

27:46.943 --> 27:48.344
I--what?
Just stay behind me.

27:48.378 --> 27:52.148
Hey, we're supposed
to be protecting you, remember?

27:52.183 --> 27:54.451
Maybe Alice decided
to take off.

27:54.485 --> 27:56.253
No, no, she's--
she's here, Myks.

27:56.287 --> 27:59.256
I mean, I'm having
major vibe-age.

28:03.127 --> 28:06.697
Alice Liddell!

28:06.731 --> 28:07.931
[Gunshot]

28:07.966 --> 28:10.200
Gunfire!

28:10.235 --> 28:12.236
Everybody get down!

28:12.271 --> 28:13.805
Give us the shard!

28:13.839 --> 28:18.075
- Get back!
- Hey!

28:18.109 --> 28:22.345
Myka, she jumped out
of the fireman.

28:22.380 --> 28:24.914
There.

28:24.949 --> 28:27.015
Secret Service, stay back!

28:27.050 --> 28:30.052
Out of the way!

28:31.721 --> 28:35.256
- Okay.
- Please let this be Alice.

28:35.291 --> 28:37.592
No. It's not Alice.

28:37.626 --> 28:39.427
Well, at least we know
what she wants now.

28:39.461 --> 28:42.430
Yeah, she wants
to kill Artie.

28:44.199 --> 28:48.169
And she could be anyone
when we she does it.

29:04.139 --> 29:05.973
- Don't worry, Artie.
- Yeah, we'll find her.

29:06.008 --> 29:08.009
Yeah.
How we gonna find her?

29:08.043 --> 29:10.144
I mean,
we can't make everyone

29:10.179 --> 29:11.913
in Rapid City
look in a mirror.

29:11.947 --> 29:13.281
Wait, you know,
it seems to me that

29:13.315 --> 29:15.116
if she's looking for us,
we have a slight advantage.

29:15.150 --> 29:16.317
Right.

29:16.352 --> 29:18.853
- We should set a trap.
- And--

29:18.887 --> 29:21.122
I know just the bait.

29:21.157 --> 29:24.125
Come on.

29:29.966 --> 29:31.699
Somebody order
a soul-sucking hookah?

29:31.734 --> 29:32.934
Okay, good, excellent.

29:32.968 --> 29:34.702
All right, let's get
the lay of the land.

29:34.737 --> 29:37.838
Two, three, four--
I count five--five exits.

29:37.873 --> 29:39.640
All right, Claudia,
you take the front.

29:39.675 --> 29:41.142
Steve, take the two
at the back.

29:41.176 --> 29:42.876
You two take the two
up in the mezzanine.

29:42.911 --> 29:44.044
Where are you gonna be?

29:44.079 --> 29:45.513
I'm gonna be right here
in the open,

29:45.547 --> 29:46.847
where Alice can see me.

29:46.882 --> 29:48.182
We can scope her out
by using

29:48.217 --> 29:50.117
the reflective surfaces
of the marble.

29:50.152 --> 29:51.686
- Or mirrors.
- Or mirrors.

29:51.720 --> 29:52.853
That's why you get
the big bucks.

29:52.888 --> 29:54.422
What bucks?
There are no bucks.

29:54.456 --> 29:56.090
Fine. Listen,
when she gets close,

29:56.125 --> 29:57.325
- you use the hookah.
- Will do.

29:57.359 --> 29:58.793
When we catch her,
what then?

29:58.827 --> 30:00.495
Well, what I'd prefer to do

30:00.529 --> 30:02.463
is bronze the little lunatic.

30:02.498 --> 30:04.499
But she has no corporeal form,

30:04.533 --> 30:06.635
so the next best thing is
back into the Dark Vault.

30:06.669 --> 30:08.336
Unless you have
a better plan?

30:08.371 --> 30:11.439
Well, maybe we--

30:11.473 --> 30:14.375
Probably not.

30:14.409 --> 30:15.743
Artie, what makes you
so sure she'll show up?

30:15.777 --> 30:17.845
She's a predator.
I'm her prey.

30:17.879 --> 30:20.581
She will not rest until
she's made her kill, trust me.

30:20.616 --> 30:22.383
All right, you two,
up the mezzanine.

30:22.417 --> 30:24.552
Claudia, you keep an eye
on the front door

30:24.586 --> 30:26.753
by hiding behind that
plant over there.

30:26.788 --> 30:28.922
- Don't let Alice see you.
- Oh, thank God you said that.

30:28.957 --> 30:30.391
Because I was gonna
jump up and down and yell,

30:30.425 --> 30:31.659
"Hey, crazy Alice,
look over here."

30:31.693 --> 30:34.529
You made your point.
Thank you.

30:34.563 --> 30:36.297
Steve, should you be back
at the Warehouse

30:36.331 --> 30:37.965
not getting hurt?

30:38.000 --> 30:39.433
You were right, Artie.

30:39.468 --> 30:40.735
I have to tell Claudia
about the metronome.

30:40.769 --> 30:42.170
Okay, first things first.

30:42.204 --> 30:45.406
Just--back doors.

30:45.441 --> 30:48.409
[Phone ringing]

30:50.045 --> 30:51.212
Where's my mirror?

30:51.246 --> 30:52.613
You, my dear, are going

30:52.648 --> 30:54.449
as far away from here
as possible.

30:54.483 --> 30:55.884
That is not gonna happen.

30:55.918 --> 30:57.619
- Vanessa, I don't wanna argue--
- I am a member

30:57.653 --> 30:59.287
- of this organization.
- You are a doctor.

30:59.321 --> 31:01.523
- You are not a field agent.
- I am the Warehouse doctor.

31:01.557 --> 31:03.759
Do you have any idea how many
agents' lives I've saved?

31:03.793 --> 31:04.893
- Including yours.
- Yeah, I was hoping

31:04.928 --> 31:06.228
not to need a doctor
this time.

31:06.262 --> 31:07.429
Besides that,
I care about you.

31:07.464 --> 31:08.731
- Well, I care about you.
- Well, good.

31:08.765 --> 31:10.499
Then this doesn't have
to come to fisticuffs.

31:10.533 --> 31:12.301
You have five exits,
four pairs of eyes.

31:12.335 --> 31:14.603
You need mine,
end of story.

31:14.637 --> 31:16.005
All right.

31:16.039 --> 31:17.272
You stand by the elevators.

31:17.307 --> 31:19.041
That's as far away
from here as possible.

31:19.075 --> 31:20.209
- Artie.
- Yeah?

31:20.243 --> 31:22.178
- This is a peppermint Patty.
- Oh.

31:22.212 --> 31:24.280
- Sorry.
- Thank you.

31:24.314 --> 31:26.015
Come on, take a breath,
relax.

31:26.049 --> 31:28.451
Just pretend to use
your Farnsworth or something.

31:28.486 --> 31:29.619
Oh, that's smart.

31:29.654 --> 31:32.622
We make a good team.

31:35.659 --> 31:37.661
Yep, you guys are definitely
not vampires.

31:37.695 --> 31:40.230
Good game.

31:40.264 --> 31:41.631
I'm all clear.

31:41.666 --> 31:42.799
All clear here.

31:42.833 --> 31:46.569
Now we just wait and watch.

31:46.604 --> 31:52.075
I just--I wish that--
never mind.

31:52.109 --> 31:53.476
What? What is it?

31:53.511 --> 31:54.945
Something's been bugging you.
What is it?

31:54.979 --> 31:57.014
It's just, you know,
I was trapped

31:57.048 --> 31:58.748
in that mirror
for a few hours.

31:58.783 --> 32:02.319
Imagine a little girl trapped
in here for over 100 years.

32:02.353 --> 32:03.954
It must be horrible.

32:03.988 --> 32:07.424
Yeah, well, she was already
a bit of a homicidal maniac

32:07.459 --> 32:09.260
before the agents
put her in there.

32:09.294 --> 32:10.761
Do you know how
she got that way?

32:10.795 --> 32:13.264
Yeah. No.

32:13.298 --> 32:15.065
[Laughs]

32:15.100 --> 32:19.603
She was at this tea party
at the home of Charles Dodgson--

32:19.638 --> 32:22.606
- Oh, uh,
AKA Lewis Carroll.

32:22.641 --> 32:24.141
You see? I retain.

32:24.176 --> 32:25.443
Very good.

32:25.477 --> 32:31.348
Anyway, um, curious Alice
found Dodgson's handgun.

32:31.383 --> 32:33.684
And her mother tried
to take it away.

32:33.719 --> 32:35.186
And when she did,
it went off.

32:35.220 --> 32:39.022
And she watched her mother die
in front of the mirror

32:39.057 --> 32:42.493
that eventually
became her prison.

32:42.527 --> 32:44.228
Look, it's pretty tragic.

32:44.262 --> 32:46.496
But, on the other hand,
she's trying to kill Artie.

32:46.531 --> 32:48.632
So, oh, well.

32:48.666 --> 32:51.835
I know, it's just
the Warehouse

32:51.869 --> 32:55.671
has this nasty habit
of turning people psycho.

32:55.705 --> 33:00.843
[Chuckles]
Yeah, well, tick-tock on us.

33:00.877 --> 33:02.678
Come on.

33:02.712 --> 33:04.780
Come on, Alice,
I'm right here.

33:04.814 --> 33:07.249
Where the hell are you?

33:07.283 --> 33:09.451
Beg your pardon,
but do you know

33:09.485 --> 33:11.553
which room Arthur Nielsen
is staying in?

33:11.587 --> 33:13.088
Oh, I'm sorry sir.

33:13.122 --> 33:15.457
We're not allowed to give away
that information.

33:15.491 --> 33:16.892
Hotel policy.

33:16.926 --> 33:20.862
Yes, but you do know
which room, don't you?

33:20.896 --> 33:23.865
Excuse me.

33:28.770 --> 33:30.138
[Distant grunting]

33:30.172 --> 33:32.173
[Thud on the floor]

33:43.119 --> 33:44.552
Artie!

33:44.587 --> 33:46.020
[Grunts]

33:46.055 --> 33:47.856
Vanessa!

33:47.890 --> 33:51.727
[Grunts]
Stop.

33:51.761 --> 33:53.863
Aah.

33:53.897 --> 33:56.599
Stop, or I'll cut her
wide open.

33:56.633 --> 33:58.701
[Laughs maniacally]

33:58.735 --> 34:00.637
Oh, my God.
It's not me she wants.

34:00.671 --> 34:03.573
It's Vanessa!

34:03.607 --> 34:05.742
No! Stop it!

34:09.914 --> 34:11.982
- Way to go, doc!
- Find the shard.

34:12.016 --> 34:14.085
Vanessa, did she hurt you?

34:14.119 --> 34:15.652
No. She held this mirror
to my face.

34:15.688 --> 34:18.223
No, you're all right.
You're all right.

34:18.257 --> 34:20.324
I hope you know
how to use that thing.

34:20.359 --> 34:23.027
Uh, open lid, extract spirit.
Seems pretty straightforward.

34:23.062 --> 34:24.696
- You might wanna stand back.
- It's not here.

34:24.730 --> 34:26.431
The bellhop doesn't have
the mirror shard.

34:26.465 --> 34:29.100
- Then where's Alice?
- She's right over here.

34:35.054 --> 34:36.655
- Artie...
- Hands in the air.

34:36.688 --> 34:38.590
- Drop it!
- Oh! Ha ha ha!

34:38.625 --> 34:40.592
I can slit his jugular
as quick as

34:40.626 --> 34:42.795
any one of you can
squeeze off a shot.

34:42.829 --> 34:44.630
Alice. Alice.
It's me you want.

34:44.665 --> 34:46.766
You let Vanessa go.
Take me instead.

34:46.800 --> 34:49.268
Artie, you and I both know
this was about

34:49.303 --> 34:50.937
so much more than that.

34:50.971 --> 34:52.839
Don't you get it?

34:52.873 --> 34:53.973
Artie!

34:54.007 --> 34:55.641
Artie!

34:55.676 --> 34:58.178
Artie!

34:58.212 --> 35:00.113
Brother Adrian's the one
who released the mirror

35:00.147 --> 35:01.581
and sent you here
to kill Vanessa--

35:01.615 --> 35:02.749
that's the plan, isn't it?

35:02.783 --> 35:04.951
To punish me for not
undoing the astrolabe?

35:04.985 --> 35:09.289
See what happens when you play
with someone else's toys?

35:09.323 --> 35:12.292
The people you love
are made to suffer.

35:12.326 --> 35:14.260
You could have killed her
before we came up here.

35:14.295 --> 35:16.496
- You didn't do it.
- Real suffering

35:16.530 --> 35:18.565
is knowing what lies
just beyond your grasp

35:18.599 --> 35:20.867
yet never being able
to reach it.

35:20.901 --> 35:22.869
I'm gonna keep this body
for a little while,

35:22.904 --> 35:26.506
and I'm gonna do some
unspeakable things to it

35:26.540 --> 35:29.976
before I cut
your beloved Vanessa's throat.

35:32.046 --> 35:34.981
- Oof!
- Sorry, Vanessa.

35:35.016 --> 35:36.416
Claudia--now!

35:36.451 --> 35:38.452
Suck on this, Alice!

35:38.486 --> 35:39.553
[Alice blows]
Ah!

35:39.588 --> 35:41.989
[Coughing]

35:42.024 --> 35:43.891
[Gasps]

35:43.925 --> 35:46.828
- [Coughing]
- Claudia?

35:51.501 --> 35:52.500
Oh!

35:57.340 --> 35:59.974
To hell with
the bloody plan.

36:18.694 --> 36:19.994
[Claudia screaming]
Myka, hold her!

36:20.029 --> 36:22.963
Open your eyes!

36:22.998 --> 36:25.399
Get out of my friends,
you bitch!

36:25.433 --> 36:29.769
Yaaaaahhhh!

36:29.804 --> 36:32.873
- Myka, get a bag?
- Okay, okay.

36:35.910 --> 36:37.744
Aah!

36:41.649 --> 36:43.016
Are you all right?

36:43.051 --> 36:44.851
Yeah. Yeah, no, I am.

36:44.886 --> 36:47.454
- I'm not sure if Claudia is.
- I guess we'll have

36:47.488 --> 36:49.189
a story to tell her.

36:49.223 --> 36:51.525
Oh... oh...

36:51.559 --> 36:54.061
- Vanessa.
- My ribs hurt.

36:54.095 --> 36:55.762
Yeah, I bet they do.

36:55.797 --> 36:58.365
- Oh, that's more in my head.
- Oh, Pete, don't get up yet.

36:58.399 --> 37:00.467
- It's okay.
- Okay...

37:00.501 --> 37:03.237
Jeez, what'd you do
to your shoulder, huh?

37:03.271 --> 37:05.405
Oh! Uh...

37:05.440 --> 37:08.575
Oh, my God.
Oh, my shoulder's killing me.

37:08.609 --> 37:11.411
Okay. Yeah, I-I think
that you and Steve

37:11.445 --> 37:13.113
need to have
a little conversation.

37:13.147 --> 37:15.815
A what?
Ow, ow, ow!

37:15.850 --> 37:17.851
Vanessa.

37:17.885 --> 37:19.319
We got her.

37:19.353 --> 37:22.589
It's over?
Oh...

37:23.891 --> 37:25.459
Yeah.

37:26.928 --> 37:29.362
All right,
so we're heading home.

37:29.397 --> 37:31.931
Dr. V, pleasure, as always.

37:31.966 --> 37:33.566
Mwah.

37:33.600 --> 37:36.703
Artie, I'll, uh,
see you in the morning.

37:36.737 --> 37:38.104
Jingle, jingle.

37:40.507 --> 37:42.108
Actually,
I'm gonna go too.

37:42.142 --> 37:43.610
You're leaving?

37:43.644 --> 37:45.111
This was a mistake.

37:45.145 --> 37:47.180
Well, not one of
our top ten dates, but--

37:47.214 --> 37:48.681
No, no, not the date.

37:48.715 --> 37:51.617
This. Us.

37:51.652 --> 37:53.486
What?

37:53.521 --> 37:55.355
Look... I always believed

37:55.389 --> 37:58.725
that the life of a Warehouse
agent, by necessity,

37:58.759 --> 38:02.596
had to be one of solitude,
isolation.

38:02.630 --> 38:06.733
And then you came into mine.

38:06.767 --> 38:08.735
And you...

38:08.769 --> 38:11.204
You gave me hope...

38:11.238 --> 38:13.941
I could have more.

38:13.975 --> 38:15.776
But after seeing
your life threatened

38:15.810 --> 38:17.344
simply because
I care about you,

38:17.378 --> 38:20.548
no, this is a mistake,
and as long as we're together,

38:20.582 --> 38:22.484
- you'll always be a target.
- Whoa, hold on, hold on.

38:22.518 --> 38:24.453
A few hours ago,
you wanted to up our game,

38:24.487 --> 38:25.788
and now it's just over.

38:25.822 --> 38:27.690
Don't you understand?

38:27.724 --> 38:29.692
Anything more than
a platonic relationship

38:29.726 --> 38:31.861
is just... too risky.

38:31.895 --> 38:35.631
- Some risks are worth taking.
- Some are not!

38:35.665 --> 38:38.367
Look, we'll...
see each other

38:38.401 --> 38:39.935
at the Warehouse
from time to time.

38:39.969 --> 38:41.169
- No.
- What?

38:41.204 --> 38:43.671
No. You don't get
to just quit on us.

38:43.705 --> 38:44.906
That's not how this works.

38:44.940 --> 38:46.174
But after what happened
tonight--

38:46.208 --> 38:48.009
It happens all the time
in this job.

38:48.043 --> 38:49.377
Being connected
to the Warehouse

38:49.411 --> 38:50.711
involves danger
on a regular basis.

38:50.746 --> 38:52.680
No, no, no.
This is not a debate.

38:52.714 --> 38:55.683
My life has become...

38:55.717 --> 39:00.788
My life has become
more complicated

39:00.822 --> 39:02.990
than I realized.

39:03.024 --> 39:06.627
And I cannot do this
right now.

39:06.661 --> 39:08.995
I'm sorry, Vanessa.

39:09.029 --> 39:10.696
It's over.

39:10.731 --> 39:13.366
Hey.

39:14.868 --> 39:16.870
I don't know
what's going on with you.

39:16.904 --> 39:18.505
But when you finally
wake up and realize

39:18.539 --> 39:20.941
that cutting yourself off
from the people who love you

39:20.975 --> 39:23.209
is a truly terrible idea...

39:23.244 --> 39:26.079
Call me.

39:26.113 --> 39:28.081
I am not going anywhere.

39:42.637 --> 39:44.939
So that's where the phantom
pains are coming from.

39:44.973 --> 39:47.007
I'm sorry.

39:47.042 --> 39:50.370
- How's the shoulder?
- It's still a <i>little</i> stabby.

39:50.411 --> 39:52.145
Regretting
bringing me back yet?

39:52.179 --> 39:54.447
You should have told me,
Steve.

39:54.481 --> 39:56.516
Well, now you know
how it feels.

39:56.550 --> 39:58.551
[Laughs]
Okay, touche.

39:58.585 --> 40:01.220
I was hoping
to disconnect myself first.

40:01.255 --> 40:02.221
What?
Ow!

40:02.255 --> 40:03.456
No--ow!

40:03.490 --> 40:05.225
- Okay.
- All right.

40:05.259 --> 40:06.960
The metronome is the only
thing keeping you alive.

40:06.994 --> 40:08.661
I can handle
a little pain, apparently.

40:08.696 --> 40:11.297
And I get mortally wounded,
can you handle a little death?

40:11.331 --> 40:13.465
Because that doesn't work
for me.

40:13.500 --> 40:16.401
Look... now that I know,

40:16.435 --> 40:18.704
we'll figure this out
together.

40:18.738 --> 40:22.775
We're a team, are we not?

40:22.809 --> 40:24.943
Yes.

40:24.978 --> 40:27.579
Come on.
They're waiting for us.

40:32.352 --> 40:34.086
Ow, ow, ow!

40:34.120 --> 40:35.554
Sorry.
Sorry.

40:35.588 --> 40:37.122
So Artie didn't want
to talk to you

40:37.156 --> 40:38.156
about what happened tonight.

40:38.191 --> 40:40.326
Nope. Just grumpier
than usual,

40:40.360 --> 40:41.861
which is saying a lot.

40:41.895 --> 40:43.262
- Hi.
- Hey.

40:43.297 --> 40:44.797
Claudia, however, found
something in the Dark Vault

40:44.832 --> 40:47.400
that might tell us
how the mirror got out.

40:47.434 --> 40:49.402
Jinksy says that someone
from Artie's past

40:49.436 --> 40:51.704
has been breaking into
the Warehouse

40:51.738 --> 40:52.905
and sending out artifacts.

40:52.939 --> 40:54.573
- What?
- Basically undoing

40:54.607 --> 40:55.974
his life's work
as a Warehouse agent.

40:56.009 --> 40:57.476
But nothing's showing up
on the security feeds.

40:57.510 --> 40:59.779
Which would explain why I've
been having the mega-vibes.

40:59.813 --> 41:01.781
But not why Artie's been
keeping us out of the loop.

41:01.815 --> 41:03.482
Or what black diamonds
mean.

41:03.517 --> 41:05.484
Look, guys,
let's not panic, okay?

41:05.518 --> 41:07.085
He's probably
just trying to protect us.

41:07.120 --> 41:10.589
Yes, but from who?

41:17.898 --> 41:21.834
First Hugo... now Vanessa.

41:21.869 --> 41:24.204
You're the one
cutting me off

41:24.238 --> 41:26.639
from the people
that I care about--not me!

41:26.674 --> 41:30.243
You're the one, Adrian.
Not me.

41:30.278 --> 41:32.279
Not me!

41:43.824 --> 41:46.426
Safe.

41:46.460 --> 41:47.761
It's safe.

41:47.795 --> 41:52.132
I don't know
how you're getting in here...

41:52.166 --> 41:55.969
But if you're here now,
know this.

41:56.004 --> 41:58.038
You coward!

41:58.073 --> 41:59.840
Coward!

42:02.912 --> 42:07.015
I will find you,
and I will stop you.

42:07.049 --> 42:09.951
Stop you.
I'll stop you.

42:09.985 --> 42:12.687
[Softer]
I'll st--stop you.

42:22.765 --> 42:24.533
