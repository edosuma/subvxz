30:36.919 --> 30:38.500
I thought I was
giving you closure.

30:38.795 --> 30:40.660
Clearly I misjudged you.

30:41.340 --> 30:42.329
I'm sorry.

30:42.424 --> 30:43.834
You didn't
misjudge me.

30:45.385 --> 30:46.886
Hey. hey.
Where are you going?

30:48.639 --> 30:52.131
I wanted to shove that gun
into Stahma Tarr's mouth

30:52.226 --> 30:55.059
and pull the trigger.
I wanted it bad.

30:57.356 --> 30:59.813
But what does that
say about me?

31:04.947 --> 31:07.154
DATAK: I'm sorry for Kenya.

31:09.034 --> 31:11.070
I didn't understand
how you felt.

31:16.291 --> 31:18.577
Plenty of regret
to go around.

31:24.550 --> 31:26.711
What you said was brave.

31:28.303 --> 31:31.261
I think it appealed
to something human in her.

31:31.348 --> 31:33.179
Kept us both alive.
Thank you.

31:39.439 --> 31:40.940
Did you mean it?

31:43.151 --> 31:45.642
Taking a bullet is easier
than living with the knowledge

31:45.737 --> 31:47.443
that I've lost you.

31:52.160 --> 31:53.821
So you've given up.

31:55.622 --> 31:57.078
I haven't been
good to you.

31:59.293 --> 32:00.578
and you're right.

32:01.837 --> 32:04.328
I probably won't
be able to change.

32:06.300 --> 32:07.756
Not enough.

32:07.843 --> 32:10.004
Perhaps if we
each changed a little.

32:19.187 --> 32:21.269
Yes. You did.

32:45.047 --> 32:46.583
Both keys are
inside of her.

32:48.508 --> 32:50.044
I have to go up
and stop her.

32:51.094 --> 32:53.005
The Kaziri will
re-terraform
the planet. Lev.

32:55.265 --> 32:57.051
Except for the ones
who are saved.

32:57.351 --> 32:59.387
You could climb
into one of these pods.

32:59.561 --> 33:00.721
She'll save you.

33:01.438 --> 33:02.598
Elm

33:03.649 --> 33:05.765
The Kaziri arkbrain
is female.

33:07.569 --> 33:10.311
The Kaziri is also
a concatenation of
arkbrain fragments.

33:10.405 --> 33:13.238
Just like the "EGO"
device inside of my neck.

33:13.659 --> 33:17.072
Is this the Kaziri that I'm
speaking with right now?

33:17.412 --> 33:19.664
Did you just hack
my imaginary wife?

33:20.749 --> 33:22.865
She's speaking
through me. Meh.

33:23.835 --> 33:26.212
Trying to carry out the
instructions our people

33:26.296 --> 33:28.127
programmed into her
3,000 years ago.

33:28.215 --> 33:30.752
DOC: Oh. is that all?
Well then. by all means. yes.

33:30.842 --> 33:32.173
genocide ho.

33:32.260 --> 33:35.297
Her goal is to create
a Votan paradise
for the worthy.

33:35.389 --> 33:37.380
You can join her.
She'll protect you

33:37.474 --> 33:39.635
from all the humans
above who want you dead.

33:40.143 --> 33:42.350
There is a place
for you in the paradise.

33:42.562 --> 33:45.224
Yeah. You see.
that whole us versus
them mentality

33:45.315 --> 33:46.600
doesn't ﬂy with
me anymore.

33:47.609 --> 33:50.601
You can tell the
Kaziri to take her
3.000-year-old

33:50.696 --> 33:52.982
instructions and shove
them up her virtual ass.

33:54.408 --> 33:56.148
I can't allow you
to leave here.

33:56.868 --> 33:59.655
If you could stop me.
you already would have.

34:01.790 --> 34:03.200

You are not
welcome here.

34:44.666 --> 34:46.907
Turning a fellow gambler away
from a game of Ivali.

34:47.002 --> 34:48.913

Castithan way. Raiga.

34:57.179 --> 34:58.669

your forgiveness.

34:59.723 --> 35:01.338
Slitting my friend
Ozin's throat...

35:01.975 --> 35:05.467
I was living by
rules from a world that
no longer exists.

35:10.025 --> 35:12.767

Spicy corn nuts.

Remember when we
used to play Ivali

35:37.677 --> 35:40.054
in that muddy back
alley off Urdu Street?

35:40.305 --> 35:42.387
Stondak bringing his
girlfriends to watch.

35:42.557 --> 35:44.718
You were quite the
swordsman in your day. Ston.

35:48.855 --> 35:51.187
I want you to know.
I bear no grudge.

35:51.650 --> 35:54.187
You betrayed our
family because you feared
for your lives.

35:54.277 --> 35:56.268
I understand. You did
what you felt you had to.

35:56.530 --> 35:58.066
But since I emerged unscathed.

35:58.156 --> 36:00.112
I would have been happy
to leave it at that.

36:00.325 --> 36:02.031
My wife. on the other hand.

36:02.577 --> 36:04.863
well. she's less forgiving.

36:06.248 --> 36:10.582
It's part of what makes
her such a strong leader.
I suppose.

36:12.921 --> 36:15.708
You see. I've never been
partial to poisons.

36:16.216 --> 36:18.298
I've always felt
like it was "women's work."

36:18.760 --> 36:23.094
But this wonderful paralytic
that my wife has concocted...

36:23.265 --> 36:27.429
Well. It is too
brilliant to ignore.

36:29.521 --> 36:32.228
It's made from
Rudash oil.

Applied to the gloves.
