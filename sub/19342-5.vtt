00:07.175 --> 00:09.343
Previously on Billions...

00:09.443 --> 00:10.744
Yee!

00:12.346 --> 00:14.182
Ah, it's a road bottle.

00:14.282 --> 00:15.783
How do you get up
and go to work?

00:15.883 --> 00:16.917
Patient concierge --

00:17.017 --> 00:19.787
Fixes me up with a room
and an I.V.

00:19.887 --> 00:22.356
Forty-five minutes, and I
rebound like an undergrad.

00:22.456 --> 00:24.058
I'm sending you somewhere.

00:24.158 --> 00:25.226
Please, not rehab.

00:25.326 --> 00:26.827
No.

00:26.927 --> 00:28.362
I need help.

00:30.664 --> 00:32.966
Sandicot's downtown
is ripe for redevelopment.

00:33.067 --> 00:36.170
Why would I ever put
any of my money

00:36.270 --> 00:37.738
in your corner
of the state?

00:37.838 --> 00:40.708
I don't expect you to do this
deal as a favor to my uncle.

00:40.808 --> 00:43.877
I expect you to do it
because of the casino.

00:43.977 --> 00:45.679
Look, I don't think
I'm gonna be able

00:45.779 --> 00:47.848
to help you get Boyd.
I want to, but --

00:47.948 --> 00:49.517
Am I going to have
to wear a wire?

00:49.617 --> 00:52.253
Mr. McKinnon,
you're gonna be a hero.

00:54.088 --> 00:55.189
Steven Birch?

00:55.289 --> 00:56.757
It's either him or you.

00:56.857 --> 00:58.592
You do an autopsy
on the deal,

00:58.692 --> 01:00.894
you'll find yourself
a Pulitzer in the carcass.

01:00.994 --> 01:02.230
The federal sentencing
guidelines

01:02.330 --> 01:05.399
call for you
to serve 11 years.

01:05.499 --> 01:07.701
I don't want to go to jail.

01:07.801 --> 01:10.037
Wise choice, Mr. Birch.

01:10.138 --> 01:12.306
I want to get out
from under this immediately.

01:12.406 --> 01:13.874
Then what can you
give me now?

01:13.974 --> 01:15.476
There are
a few mid-level guys.

01:15.576 --> 01:17.111
What if I sacrifice them?

01:17.211 --> 01:19.880
I have another source I can
check to be sure it's legit.

01:19.980 --> 01:21.382
I'll be careful.

01:21.482 --> 01:22.950
You better be.

01:23.050 --> 01:25.353
But not everyone out there's
a savage.

01:25.453 --> 01:28.189
Rhoades opened his eyes
to the bigger picture.

01:30.591 --> 01:33.060
I don't like the idea
of Boyd going down.

01:33.161 --> 01:35.496
Doesn't --
Doesn't sit right with me.

01:35.596 --> 01:37.265
You never give anyone
your playbook,

01:37.365 --> 01:40.168
no matter how much you're
rooting for them to win.

01:50.178 --> 01:53.214
* dramatic music *

02:02.923 --> 02:06.460
* If heartaches brought fame *

02:06.560 --> 02:11.064
* In love's crazy game *

02:11.165 --> 02:13.667
* I'd be a legend *

02:13.767 --> 02:17.638
* In my time *

02:17.738 --> 02:20.040
I'll move the car
for you, Mr. Wagner.

02:20.140 --> 02:22.310
You will leave it
right there.

02:22.410 --> 02:25.713
I and it will be gone
before long.

02:25.813 --> 02:28.582
* I'd be a legend *

02:28.682 --> 02:31.885
* In my time *
Look, it's Wags.

02:31.985 --> 02:34.121
- Hey, Wags, how --
- It's Wags.

02:34.222 --> 02:35.923
* If they gave
gold statuettes *

02:36.023 --> 02:37.391
Wags,
where you been?

02:37.491 --> 02:39.159
Wags, I've
been calling you.

02:39.260 --> 02:41.195
* For tears and regrets *

02:41.295 --> 02:42.763
Call you back.

02:42.863 --> 02:45.366
* I'd be a legend *

02:45.466 --> 02:49.570
* In my time *

02:49.670 --> 02:51.305
You haven't
been drinking.

02:51.405 --> 02:53.040
Your eyes are clear.

02:55.743 --> 02:57.311
Let me see.

02:59.513 --> 03:01.649
It's not shaking.

03:01.749 --> 03:03.050
I want to get this out.

03:03.150 --> 03:04.885
When I started here,

03:04.985 --> 03:08.389
I made a promise to you,
and you to me.

03:08.489 --> 03:11.759
We've kept that promise
no matter what.

03:11.859 --> 03:13.594
Well, with a windup
like that,

03:13.694 --> 03:16.330
I'm sure whatever you have
to say must be important.

03:16.430 --> 03:18.131
It is.

03:18.232 --> 03:20.000
Momentous even.

03:20.100 --> 03:21.201
Yeah.

03:21.302 --> 03:24.171
Ah, thing is, it's not
your turn to speak.

03:24.272 --> 03:25.739
Why's that?

03:25.839 --> 03:28.709
Because while you have been
out there learning the Yaqui Way

03:28.809 --> 03:30.378
or how to run like
the Tarahumara,

03:30.478 --> 03:32.280
I have been in here
fighting the battle

03:32.380 --> 03:34.615
of fucking Thermopylae!

03:34.715 --> 03:35.816
* slow country music *

03:37.985 --> 03:41.755
* If heartaches brought fame *

03:41.855 --> 03:44.625
* and love's crazy game... *

03:44.725 --> 03:46.494
Hell of a job, Sung.

03:46.594 --> 03:48.896
Corporate was going on
about how we'd never

03:48.996 --> 03:51.832
make delivery
on the Sapphire Super-Thin.

03:51.932 --> 03:54.802
I was like, shit,
you don't know Sung.

03:56.404 --> 03:59.273
* ...gold statuettes *

03:59.373 --> 04:03.277
* For tears and regret *

04:03.377 --> 04:06.046
* I'd be a legend *

04:06.146 --> 04:09.850
* In my time *

04:12.019 --> 04:16.490
* But they don't give awards *

04:16.590 --> 04:20.928
* And there's no praise
or fame *

04:21.028 --> 04:24.865
* For hearts that are broken *

04:24.965 --> 04:27.768
* For love that's in vain *

04:33.707 --> 04:36.209
* suspenseful music *

04:38.078 --> 04:39.947
Axe, we're fucked!

04:48.522 --> 04:50.223
Gordie, say hi
to Mr. Pawlowski.

04:50.324 --> 04:52.025
Fuck that.
It's Nicky, kid.

04:52.125 --> 04:53.661
Nicky.
Hello.

04:53.761 --> 04:55.829
You know, I owe everything
to your dad.

04:55.929 --> 04:57.064
You know that?

04:57.164 --> 04:59.266
We were getting killed out here,
couldn't make a dime.

04:59.367 --> 05:01.034
And then your dad figures out
how we could come away

05:01.134 --> 05:03.871
with $50k a race
on the triple.

05:03.971 --> 05:05.172
You see you real--
All right, all right,

05:05.272 --> 05:07.408
we'll give him the full
education another time.

05:07.508 --> 05:09.543
He already knows
the most important part.

05:09.643 --> 05:12.446
Who makes a bet if they don't
know how it's gonna turn out?

05:12.546 --> 05:13.347
Suckers.

05:15.649 --> 05:16.850
Go take
some pictures, yeah?

05:16.950 --> 05:18.151
My phone's dead.

05:19.487 --> 05:20.921
Here you go.

05:24.057 --> 05:26.527
You didn't come up here
for a tip on a race?

05:26.627 --> 05:28.328
You heard anything
about a new casino

05:28.429 --> 05:30.698
coming
to upstate New York?

05:30.798 --> 05:32.900
Whispers, yeah.
I heard whispers.

05:33.000 --> 05:36.537
It's important I find out
where exactly it's going.

05:36.637 --> 05:38.271
The town's unclear.

05:38.372 --> 05:40.240
But I did hear
this big casino guy,

05:40.340 --> 05:42.242
Donald Thayer,
he's getting ready

05:42.342 --> 05:44.044
to get busy
building upstate.

05:44.144 --> 05:45.145
I know Thayer.

05:45.245 --> 05:46.580
Mm.
'Course you do.

05:46.680 --> 05:48.649
Dad, your phone
is, like, blowing up.

05:48.749 --> 05:49.983
Oh, yeah?

05:50.083 --> 05:52.953
* dramatic music *

05:59.727 --> 06:01.495
Calling to tell me
Sansomic's fucked?

06:01.595 --> 06:02.563
I just got word.

06:02.663 --> 06:03.864
Yeah, they're gonna
stiff delivery

06:03.964 --> 06:05.799
on 400,000
Celestial phones.

06:05.899 --> 06:08.669
Their glass supplier beefed
on the new super-thin screens.

06:08.769 --> 06:11.038
They crack under the heat gun
during adhesion.

06:11.138 --> 06:13.206
Some guy in Korea
took a mickey over it.

06:13.306 --> 06:15.676
But that's only half
the reason why I'm calling.

06:15.776 --> 06:16.744
What?

06:16.844 --> 06:18.612
Sam Brandt --
Street Scoop --

06:18.712 --> 06:19.880
Out hunting.

06:19.980 --> 06:21.314
She knows
you're lugging the stock

06:21.415 --> 06:23.617
and you're facing your first
down quarter because of it.

06:23.717 --> 06:26.253
She wants you to be
a talking head on her show.

06:26.353 --> 06:28.221
Shit! Can you spike it?

06:28.321 --> 06:30.290
No, but if you say
you'll go on,

06:30.390 --> 06:32.960
you can buy yourself the last
three days of the month.

06:33.060 --> 06:34.995
All right, I'll do it.

06:35.095 --> 06:36.830
Thanks for the heads up.

06:36.930 --> 06:40.400
***

06:40.501 --> 06:42.970
Fuck.

06:45.405 --> 06:47.007
So, we're still
talking about this?

06:47.107 --> 06:48.709
We are.

06:48.809 --> 06:50.744
Huh.

06:50.844 --> 06:51.745
It's beneath us.

06:51.845 --> 06:52.780
Petty.

06:52.880 --> 06:56.183
Let's not judge
in that way.

06:56.283 --> 06:58.051
Wendy.

07:00.120 --> 07:02.823
I ask him not
to overdress for dinner.

07:02.923 --> 07:04.157
Eight people on a patio,

07:04.257 --> 07:06.860
he says he won't,
then he shows up in...

07:06.960 --> 07:08.195
that suit.

07:08.295 --> 07:09.597
I was coming
from the office.

07:09.697 --> 07:10.898
Erica lives three
blocks from us.

07:10.998 --> 07:12.399
Oh, okay.

07:12.500 --> 07:15.035
So, I wanted
to wear the suit.

07:15.135 --> 07:16.436
You know, we weren't
white-water rafting

07:16.537 --> 07:17.571
down the Colorado,

07:17.671 --> 07:20.340
we were having bisque
for fuck's sake.

07:20.440 --> 07:24.945
Oh, on a courtyard outside
a $7 million townhouse.

07:25.045 --> 07:26.714
Wendy...

07:26.814 --> 07:29.216
can you tell Chuck why
it bothered you so much

07:29.316 --> 07:31.018
that he wore that suit?

07:32.653 --> 07:33.854
Yeah.

07:33.954 --> 07:36.857
He can't for a second
let anyone forget he is

07:36.957 --> 07:39.560
the "United States Attorney
for the Southern District."

07:39.660 --> 07:42.930
So, the suit.

07:43.030 --> 07:45.332
It's not enough for him
to think his profession

07:45.432 --> 07:48.101
is -- is a calling while
everyone else merely has a job.

07:48.201 --> 07:49.870
He needs to prove it
at all times --

07:49.970 --> 07:54.141
Do you think I can't tell
the way people look at us?

08:00.113 --> 08:03.416
Don't you think that I know
that you can do better than me?

08:06.520 --> 08:07.588
Maybe I want
to wear something

08:07.688 --> 08:09.923
that won't make them
look at us and wonder,

08:10.023 --> 08:12.993
"Gee, what is she
doing with him?"

08:26.006 --> 08:28.475
I had no idea
you felt that way.

08:34.214 --> 08:35.683
If the quarter ended today,

08:35.783 --> 08:39.252
we'd be underwater
like Crimson fucking Tide.

08:39.352 --> 08:43.557
Sansomic has pulled us down
to negative 2.3%.

08:43.657 --> 08:45.926
But we have three days
to turn that around.

08:46.026 --> 08:48.428
So, what do you have for me?

08:48.528 --> 08:50.363
I'm peeling back the skin
on Territory Petroleum.

08:50.463 --> 08:51.632
They're sitting
on good numbers.

08:51.732 --> 08:52.499
If they come out,
it'll bump seven --

08:52.600 --> 08:53.834
It's too late.

08:53.934 --> 08:56.670
When the numbers come out,
we're a dead man walking.

08:56.770 --> 08:59.106
Aren't you supposed to be
on the Sandicot muni-bond deal?

08:59.206 --> 09:00.373
Why are you even here?

09:00.473 --> 09:01.975
I thought it was
an all-hands situation, urgent.

09:02.075 --> 09:03.443
Yes, it is.

09:03.543 --> 09:06.446
But the greats never sacrifice
the important for the urgent.

09:06.546 --> 09:07.648
They handle
the immediate problem

09:07.748 --> 09:09.650
and still make sure
to secure the future.

09:09.750 --> 09:10.684
Ferguson?

09:10.784 --> 09:12.720
Rip our illiquid longs.

09:12.820 --> 09:14.454
I've got a few positions
on my book

09:14.554 --> 09:15.823
that are ready
for juicing.

09:15.923 --> 09:17.991
And we could add some classy
names to the investor letter --

09:18.091 --> 09:19.893
That's fucking
window dressing.

09:19.993 --> 09:21.028
Graff?

09:21.128 --> 09:22.562
We flee to quality.

09:22.663 --> 09:23.764
Blue-chip time.

09:23.864 --> 09:24.965
It may not be fast,

09:25.065 --> 09:26.399
but at least we'll be able
to show our investors --

09:26.499 --> 09:29.269
Do you think I don't understand
what the fuck is going on?

09:29.369 --> 09:31.538
You are all playing it safe
for the quarter

09:31.639 --> 09:34.642
so you have a shot of personally
being up on the year.

09:34.742 --> 09:38.712
You are all
selfish motherfuckers!

09:38.812 --> 09:41.014
Looking to mitigate
your downsides

09:41.114 --> 09:43.583
and protect your bonuses.

09:43.684 --> 09:48.355
The only currency
that this firm has --

09:48.455 --> 09:50.123
that any firm has these days --

09:50.223 --> 09:51.725
is its winning streak.

09:51.825 --> 09:54.828
The Kevlar of
"knowing the answer."

09:54.928 --> 09:57.731
You break that,
you break the whole thing.

09:57.831 --> 10:00.934
* dramatic music *

10:01.034 --> 10:04.805
Nobody leaves here
until you hand me an idea

10:04.905 --> 10:08.408
that I can shock the world
with in a few days time.

10:08.508 --> 10:10.978
***

10:15.415 --> 10:16.984
Fuck this.

10:18.786 --> 10:20.287
Finally someone
has something.

10:20.387 --> 10:21.454
The way I see it,

10:21.554 --> 10:24.224
we need a quick fix
in a non-quick-fix market.

10:24.324 --> 10:26.193
Yeah.

10:26.293 --> 10:28.128
I have an idea.

10:28.228 --> 10:30.297
I was talking to Victor.

10:30.397 --> 10:32.232
Why were you
talking to Victor?

10:32.332 --> 10:35.635
You know why.

10:35.736 --> 10:37.004
She have to be here?

10:37.104 --> 10:39.072
Sure as shit.

10:39.172 --> 10:40.373
Changes what I can pitch.

10:40.473 --> 10:42.743
By design.

10:42.843 --> 10:44.611
Well, you may have
solved one problem,

10:44.712 --> 10:47.681
but you made the crucial
one much harder to solve.

10:47.781 --> 10:48.849
So you got nothing.

10:48.949 --> 10:50.684
No, I have
just what you need.

10:50.784 --> 10:52.820
But apparently,
I can't give it to you.

11:05.699 --> 11:07.935
You're allowed, you know.

11:08.035 --> 11:11.104
You are not an algorithm,
you are not a machine,

11:11.204 --> 11:12.940
you're human.

11:13.040 --> 11:15.408
You are allowed
to have a down quarter.

11:15.508 --> 11:18.145
All hedge funds do,
eventually.

11:18.245 --> 11:20.547
Trust can be built
on fallibility.

11:20.647 --> 11:21.882
There have been studies.

11:21.982 --> 11:23.283
You said
you were determined

11:23.383 --> 11:25.452
to never come close
to the line.

11:25.552 --> 11:27.054
Those are the terms
under which I'm here,

11:27.154 --> 11:30.390
so you have to be prepared
for results like these.

11:30.490 --> 11:33.126
You have to be,
if not okay with them,

11:33.226 --> 11:35.462
then at least accepting.

11:37.297 --> 11:39.900
I want some privacy.
And where the fuck is Wags?

11:40.000 --> 11:41.301
Find him.

11:41.401 --> 11:43.570
* dramatic music *

11:49.042 --> 11:52.946
Mr. Watley,
hold up, please.

11:53.046 --> 11:55.282
I have a meeting --
very important.

11:57.250 --> 11:58.952
Uh, I'll make myself
available to you

11:59.052 --> 12:00.553
first opening
in my Filofax.

12:00.653 --> 12:02.522
I've seen your calendar.

12:02.622 --> 12:05.025
Make an opening.

12:05.125 --> 12:06.293
Or I will.

12:06.393 --> 12:09.362
* dramatic music *

12:13.066 --> 12:14.634
Deb, you found Wags?

12:14.734 --> 12:16.837
No.

12:16.937 --> 12:19.072
I have an idea.

12:19.172 --> 12:20.440
You do?
Part of one.

12:20.540 --> 12:22.142
It's not mine.

12:22.242 --> 12:25.545
I overheard it
from Mafee...

12:25.645 --> 12:26.780
last night.

12:26.880 --> 12:28.048
Ah.

12:28.148 --> 12:29.783
But he can't know
it's from me.

12:29.883 --> 12:31.451
It's sensitive.

12:31.551 --> 12:33.620
He's hiding from you.

12:44.597 --> 12:46.533
Is this where you do
your best thinking?

12:46.633 --> 12:49.837
I was just
finishing up.

12:49.937 --> 12:52.372
I know you, Mafee.

12:52.472 --> 12:54.541
I know when
you're holding out.

12:54.641 --> 12:57.544
There's no one else but us.
You should share.

12:57.644 --> 12:59.779
There's this
currency play.

13:02.549 --> 13:04.952
Are you transmitting me
the details telepathically?

13:05.052 --> 13:07.020
Okay, just --

13:07.120 --> 13:09.556
There's this guy --
Everett Wright.

13:09.656 --> 13:11.959
We're bros.
From college.

13:12.059 --> 13:13.226
Played lax together.

13:13.326 --> 13:17.197
Fucking Eveready, he was
always better than me.

13:17.297 --> 13:19.299
He trades currency
over at Richards.

13:19.399 --> 13:23.670
Started crushing it
right out of school.

13:23.770 --> 13:26.239
Thing is,
he's a great guy.

13:26.339 --> 13:27.374
I love him.

13:27.474 --> 13:29.209
When I landed my job
here, I thought,

13:29.309 --> 13:32.512
"Damn, I finally
crept ahead."

13:32.612 --> 13:34.081
But if I tell you
what he's got,

13:34.181 --> 13:35.949
you'll love him.

13:36.049 --> 13:39.419
Mafee, no one could take
your place in my heart.

13:39.519 --> 13:40.921
You don't know Eveready.

13:41.021 --> 13:43.490
You'll bring him in.

13:43.590 --> 13:46.359
He'll meet Deb.

13:51.031 --> 13:52.332
Shit.

13:56.103 --> 13:57.704
I wanted
to talk next steps

13:57.804 --> 13:59.973
in the Lawrence Boyd
investigation.

14:00.073 --> 14:02.242
Now that we have McKinnon
back on a wire,

14:02.342 --> 14:03.843
shouldn't we
be proactive?

14:05.879 --> 14:08.348
Have you ever been
hunting, Sacker?

14:08.448 --> 14:10.483
Uh, no, I'm black.

14:10.583 --> 14:12.552
I didn't realize
that was a thing.

14:12.652 --> 14:13.553
It is.

14:15.923 --> 14:19.192
Well, uh, before
I started high school,

14:19.292 --> 14:24.197
my father took me up
to Canada to hunt wolves.

14:24.297 --> 14:26.799
Something about making
a man of me.

14:26.900 --> 14:31.104
Oh, it was... awful.

14:31.204 --> 14:34.674
I remember we tried
everything to bag one.

14:34.774 --> 14:37.444
Tracking.
He left deer meat.

14:37.544 --> 14:39.579
Howling.

14:39.679 --> 14:40.948
He blew into a caller

14:41.048 --> 14:43.383
that was supposed to sound
like a dying rabbit.

14:43.483 --> 14:47.587
And all the while, we didn't
see a single blessed wolf.

14:47.687 --> 14:50.123
Well, after three
brutal days of this,

14:50.223 --> 14:52.192
we came across a hunter,
old guy --

14:52.292 --> 14:54.694
He was probably too old
to be out there --

14:54.794 --> 14:58.265
And he gave us
some advice.

14:58.365 --> 15:02.169
The next day,
we saw three wolves...

15:02.269 --> 15:04.537
and bagged one.

15:04.637 --> 15:06.239
What did he say?

15:06.339 --> 15:08.775
He told my father
to use the only trap

15:08.875 --> 15:11.311
that can't be avoided
by man or beast

15:11.411 --> 15:13.746
or Lawrence Boyd.

15:13.846 --> 15:15.615
He told him to --

15:15.715 --> 15:17.450
McKinnon called me.

15:19.719 --> 15:21.121
Hey.
Hey.

15:22.655 --> 15:25.125
Chef Ryan has everything
set up for your new friend.

15:25.225 --> 15:26.226
He's outside.

15:26.326 --> 15:29.762
A little
home court hospitality?

15:29.862 --> 15:32.732
I need you to do
something for me.

15:32.832 --> 15:35.002
I want to take the business
to the next level.

15:35.102 --> 15:36.803
To raise capital.

15:36.903 --> 15:38.871
You never even have to ask me
before writing a check.

15:38.972 --> 15:42.242
No, I don't want to just
take it from you.

15:42.342 --> 15:45.078
I want the business
to have outside validation.

15:45.178 --> 15:46.579
An actual cap raise.

15:46.679 --> 15:48.881
You sure you're ready?

15:48.982 --> 15:51.351
'Cause what you're asking,
if you're not ready...

15:51.451 --> 15:54.154
I'm ready.

15:54.254 --> 15:56.523
Okay.
I'll call Boyd.

15:56.623 --> 15:57.890
And he'll have
the right guy at Spartan-Ives

15:57.991 --> 16:00.560
sit with you
about expanding.

16:05.032 --> 16:06.199
Lobster?

16:06.299 --> 16:07.700
Yeah, to impress you.

16:07.800 --> 16:10.303
You impressed?

16:10.403 --> 16:13.440
So, Mafee tells me

16:13.540 --> 16:15.408
that you're not happy
over at Richards.

16:15.508 --> 16:17.810
Oh, Mafee.

16:17.910 --> 16:19.979
That boy's
something else.

16:20.080 --> 16:22.082
I'd get fired just
for having this meeting.

16:22.182 --> 16:23.750
Yeah, well, if this
meeting goes well,

16:23.850 --> 16:26.919
that's not gonna be
a big concern for you.

16:27.020 --> 16:29.789
Right.

16:29.889 --> 16:32.492
They're leaving a lot of money
on the table at my firm.

16:32.592 --> 16:34.961
And I just have a
philosophical problem with that.

16:35.062 --> 16:38.365
Yeah, so what opportunities
are they scared to pursue?

16:38.465 --> 16:39.699
It's not a one-firm play.

16:39.799 --> 16:42.335
You need all five families
going in to make it work.

16:42.435 --> 16:43.336
I'm listening.

16:43.436 --> 16:44.571
The Nigerian government

16:44.671 --> 16:47.340
is gonna devalue
their currency.

16:47.440 --> 16:48.841
You know that?

16:48.941 --> 16:51.010
The Central Bank Governor
told me.

16:51.111 --> 16:52.612
Really?

16:52.712 --> 16:54.181
The Nigerian
oil industry is weaker

16:54.281 --> 16:55.415
than numbers suggest.

16:55.515 --> 16:56.583
Much weaker.

16:56.683 --> 16:58.485
A strong gust of wind
could blow it over.

16:58.585 --> 17:00.187
They have to devalue.

17:00.287 --> 17:01.721
And when
are they gonna do it?

17:01.821 --> 17:03.490
That's the tricky part.

17:03.590 --> 17:04.924
Could be a month from now.

17:05.024 --> 17:08.428
And with the right pressure,
could be tomorrow,

17:08.528 --> 17:11.198
if somebody takes a massive
short position against it.

17:13.600 --> 17:16.069
E-mail me your research --
Encrypt it --

17:16.169 --> 17:18.338
as soon as
we finish lunch.

17:18.438 --> 17:19.672
If I like what I see,

17:19.772 --> 17:22.075
this won't be the last lobster
we crush together.

17:23.843 --> 17:26.846
* dramatic music *

17:26.946 --> 17:30.450
I got a beautiful wool
silk twill to show you.

17:30.550 --> 17:32.519
Come pick your lining
when you're ready.

17:32.619 --> 17:35.388
* classical music plays *

17:39.159 --> 17:40.593
So, I've read
his research.

17:40.693 --> 17:42.829
It's strong,
but it's a big play.

17:42.929 --> 17:44.997
It's way out of
my risk parameters.

17:45.098 --> 17:46.299
Come in on it
for three billion.

17:46.399 --> 17:47.800
It'll be a huge score.

17:47.900 --> 17:51.571
I can't, Bobby. I deal
with Nigeria all the time.

17:51.671 --> 17:53.140
Same with all the primes.

17:53.240 --> 17:55.708
Their sovereign wealth fund.

17:55.808 --> 17:58.044
None of us can be seen
taking down a government.

17:58.145 --> 18:01.248
Look, if it's weak enough
to go, it's nobody's fault.

18:01.348 --> 18:03.316
All the same.
What about levering up?

18:03.416 --> 18:04.617
No, if I go
to the banks,

18:04.717 --> 18:06.786
word will get out,
they'll crack my position.

18:06.886 --> 18:08.355
Of course.

18:08.455 --> 18:10.123
You need to go
to others like you

18:10.223 --> 18:12.392
who are free to operate
in the margins.

18:12.492 --> 18:14.927
Big players.
Cash heavy.

18:15.027 --> 18:18.265
Krakow, Malverne,
even Birch.

18:18.365 --> 18:20.300
His family office
had a nice year.

18:20.400 --> 18:21.901
This could really
work for him.

18:22.001 --> 18:24.571
Yeah, I'm not sure they'll
come and play on my behalf.

18:24.671 --> 18:26.072
I know about
your histories.

18:26.173 --> 18:28.341
But if I tell them
where the gold is,

18:28.441 --> 18:30.143
they'll show up
with their shovels.

18:32.312 --> 18:33.413
Want a tie?

18:33.513 --> 18:34.781
No, maybe next time.

18:34.881 --> 18:36.916
I'll be expecting
to hear from you.

18:37.016 --> 18:40.052
* dramatic music *

18:44.924 --> 18:46.459
It's Wags.

18:46.559 --> 18:48.060
Don't be boring.

18:48.161 --> 18:50.630
Oh, come --
Wags, where the fuck are you?

18:50.730 --> 18:52.899
***

18:58.338 --> 19:01.174
I almost blew it already.

19:01.274 --> 19:04.311
Standing in the men's room
babbling to Michael Arendt.

19:04.411 --> 19:06.679
Partner Managing Director
of Fixed Income.

19:06.779 --> 19:08.415
It was bad.

19:08.515 --> 19:12.552
* suspenseful music *

19:12.652 --> 19:15.455
Hey, Mike, hey.

19:15.555 --> 19:18.591
Mind giving me
a little space here, Tom?

19:18.691 --> 19:21.761
Yeah, sure.

19:21.861 --> 19:24.063
Did you catch the Knicks game
last night, Mike?

19:24.163 --> 19:26.132
There wasn't
a Knicks game last night.

19:26.233 --> 19:27.834
I-I mean Mets.

19:29.035 --> 19:30.303
We should catch
a game sometime,

19:30.403 --> 19:31.638
you know, talk about
how we truss up

19:31.738 --> 19:34.006
the Treasury market
like it's a Thanksgiving turkey.

19:36.643 --> 19:37.910
What the hell, man?

19:40.112 --> 19:41.981
I got a lot of work to do.

19:42.081 --> 19:43.115
See ya.

19:43.216 --> 19:47.420
***

19:47.520 --> 19:48.955
I'm sorry.

19:51.123 --> 19:52.892
Here, give it to me.

19:54.894 --> 19:56.062
Come on.

20:03.703 --> 20:07.940
Well, this has all been
a lot for you.

20:08.040 --> 20:11.411
And I'm sorry we haven't
all had more success.

20:23.222 --> 20:24.524
Should we go after him?

20:25.892 --> 20:28.328
Let it eat at him.

20:28.428 --> 20:30.563
He'll beg me
to get this back.

20:38.237 --> 20:41.541
When the guys see me training
to climb the Col du Tourmalet,

20:41.641 --> 20:43.810
it'll inspire them
to great heights, too.

20:47.113 --> 20:49.749
I'll skip
the cooldown.

20:49.849 --> 20:52.652
No need. This'll be quick,
and then you can get back at it.

20:52.752 --> 20:56.423
Nope. You're in here.

20:56.523 --> 20:59.191
Let's be here.

20:59.292 --> 21:01.294
Together.

21:02.895 --> 21:05.465
Well, I-I just want to know
if you've heard from Wags.

21:05.565 --> 21:06.933
No.

21:07.033 --> 21:08.468
I had heard
he's M.I.A.

21:08.568 --> 21:09.802
and that the guys here
miss him,

21:09.902 --> 21:12.305
which surprised me.

21:12.405 --> 21:14.841
What, that he's off the grid
or that they miss him?

21:14.941 --> 21:16.376
Anyone could see
that he was driving

21:16.476 --> 21:19.646
towards a wall
like Dale Earnhardt at Daytona.

21:19.746 --> 21:21.280
And what did you do
to stop it?

21:21.381 --> 21:23.115
No. No, sir.

21:23.215 --> 21:25.785
If a crash is coming,
I say you bring it.

21:25.885 --> 21:27.887
It's the only way
to get to the other side.

21:27.987 --> 21:29.155
If you survive.

21:29.255 --> 21:33.292
Look, you hired me
to help you maximize results,

21:33.393 --> 21:34.561
not to coddle the staff.

21:34.661 --> 21:35.562
He hired you.

21:35.662 --> 21:37.263
I sort of rubber-stamped it.

21:37.364 --> 21:40.433
And you listen to all
of his suggestions?

21:43.102 --> 21:45.405
You said you were surprised
that they missed him?

21:45.505 --> 21:46.773
Well, they talk about him

21:46.873 --> 21:48.975
like they hate his fucking guts
most of the time.

21:49.075 --> 21:52.011
That way
they don't hate me.

21:52.111 --> 21:54.414
He's willing to put himself
in that spot.

21:54.514 --> 21:58.284
So it's his loyalty
that matters to you.

21:58.385 --> 22:00.487
This isn't about me.

22:00.587 --> 22:02.088
You didn't have
to walk down here

22:02.188 --> 22:03.823
to see if I knew
where Wags was, boyo.

22:03.923 --> 22:05.191
You could've just called.

22:05.291 --> 22:08.361
You came in here because
you want it to be about you.

22:08.461 --> 22:12.198
Because you need it
to be about you.

22:12.298 --> 22:15.267
And I am here
for exactly that purpose.

22:15.368 --> 22:16.335
Really?

22:18.871 --> 22:21.641
Let me
into that kitchen.

22:21.741 --> 22:25.011
What specific role
does Wags serve for you?

22:25.111 --> 22:28.214
He's my personal
bullshit detector.

22:28.314 --> 22:29.682
And he makes me laugh.

22:29.782 --> 22:32.585
Well, I can fill
that role.

22:34.954 --> 22:36.088
You'll be
my bullshit detector?

22:36.188 --> 22:37.356
Absolutely.

22:37.457 --> 22:40.527
Like a double shot
of Skin Bracer across the chops.

22:43.262 --> 22:45.698
Well, let me do
the same for you.

22:45.798 --> 22:49.168
One -- the only way you are
ever getting in my kitchen

22:49.268 --> 22:52.004
is if my chef
takes the weekend off.

22:52.104 --> 22:55.442
Two -- I'd never trust anyone
who'd undercut the man

22:55.542 --> 22:57.243
who got him a job.

22:57.343 --> 22:59.879
Three -- when the guys
look in here

22:59.979 --> 23:01.781
and see you training
for the Tour de France

23:01.881 --> 23:03.550
in your underwear

23:03.650 --> 23:06.853
in Wendy Rhoades' office,

23:06.953 --> 23:08.988
they're not inspired.

23:09.088 --> 23:10.690
They're just wondering

23:10.790 --> 23:13.793
why the hell
she isn't here anymore.

23:13.893 --> 23:16.062
* dramatic music *

23:28.841 --> 23:31.143
Tight pitch.

23:31.243 --> 23:32.344
Cool business.

23:32.445 --> 23:33.480
Thanks.

23:33.580 --> 23:35.247
Why do you really
want the money?

23:37.584 --> 23:40.252
We need to outflank
competitors now.

23:40.352 --> 23:42.154
Grow our market share
fast and fat

23:42.254 --> 23:43.456
and chase them out
of the fields.

23:43.556 --> 23:45.224
We're paying retail
for the drugs.

23:45.324 --> 23:47.494
We need to buy in bulk,
increase our margins.

23:47.594 --> 23:50.362
We see college campuses
as our next frontier.

23:50.463 --> 23:52.198
Hangover central, you know?

23:52.298 --> 23:55.167
And since we can show that our
product enhances performance,

23:55.267 --> 23:57.904
the fitness industry
is logical, too.

23:58.004 --> 24:00.172
I could put you guys
in front of the money

24:00.272 --> 24:02.208
for a round of meetings.

24:02.308 --> 24:06.012
They are going
to lap you two up.

24:06.112 --> 24:08.080
Mm.

24:08.180 --> 24:10.683
Well, thank you
for your time.

24:10.783 --> 24:12.885
We'll, um,
be in touch to schedule.

24:12.985 --> 24:14.954
Hey, anything
for Lawrence Boyd.

24:15.054 --> 24:16.956
It was a personal ask
from him.

24:17.056 --> 24:19.626
And anything
for your husband.

24:20.927 --> 24:22.595
Thanks.

24:33.540 --> 24:35.642
Bryan.

24:37.209 --> 24:38.110
I'm sorry. Gimme a sec.

24:38.210 --> 24:39.311
Okay.

24:42.749 --> 24:44.350
I heard
you were in here.

24:44.450 --> 24:46.318
Is this Go club?

24:46.418 --> 24:47.954
Yeah.

24:48.054 --> 24:52.058
My night to host,
and my apartment's too small.

24:52.158 --> 24:53.025
I tried you.

24:53.125 --> 24:55.227
Oh, we put them
in the basket

24:55.327 --> 24:57.730
before we play,
because, you know...

25:02.101 --> 25:05.004
Because Go players didn't have
cellphones in ancient times.

25:05.104 --> 25:07.273
Okay. Got it.

25:07.373 --> 25:10.877
And do you take a vow
of celibacy, as well?

25:10.977 --> 25:12.511
No, it's just
the end result.

25:15.214 --> 25:16.916
McKinnon just sent word.

25:17.016 --> 25:18.084
He and his wife
are having dinner

25:18.184 --> 25:20.519
with Boyd and his wife
tomorrow night.

25:21.487 --> 25:22.555
That was quick.
You were right.

25:22.655 --> 25:23.990
Private table
at Ai Fiori.

25:24.090 --> 25:25.257
Cozy.

25:25.357 --> 25:27.026
Coordinate with FBI
to set up surveillance.

25:27.126 --> 25:28.460
We're gonna be there.

25:28.561 --> 25:29.361
Yes, sir.

25:29.461 --> 25:31.297
Oh, I almost forgot,

25:31.397 --> 25:34.000
you better block that
monkey jump at the bottom.

26:01.527 --> 26:02.795
I don't walk
in the fucking door

26:02.895 --> 26:05.031
without it being
Lawrence Boyd asking.

26:05.131 --> 26:06.365
Why are we here?

26:06.465 --> 26:07.700
Hi.
What can I get you?

26:07.800 --> 26:09.168
Could you get them
three lumberjacks, please?

26:09.268 --> 26:10.569
Sure.

26:12.471 --> 26:15.007
Nigeria is gonna
devalue its currency.

26:16.208 --> 26:17.409
Get the hell out of here.

26:17.509 --> 26:18.778
How could you know that?

26:18.878 --> 26:20.579
Because we're gonna
make it happen.

26:20.680 --> 26:22.014
Jesus fuck.

26:22.114 --> 26:23.816
I have all
the research for you.

26:23.916 --> 26:25.752
Currency plays are
all about timing.

26:25.852 --> 26:27.954
You get in too late,
there's nothing there.

26:28.054 --> 26:30.456
But you get in too early,
they raise interest rates

26:30.556 --> 26:32.124
and bleed you out
of your position.

26:32.224 --> 26:33.259
Agreed.

26:33.359 --> 26:34.694
Being early is the same
as being wrong.

26:34.794 --> 26:36.095
That's why I'm here.

26:36.195 --> 26:38.097
But if each of us
take a monster position

26:38.197 --> 26:41.133
against the Naira,
we dictate the timing.

26:41.233 --> 26:44.203
I have traders shorting it
in Australasia as we speak,

26:44.303 --> 26:47.039
and I have orders teed up
all across Europe.

26:47.139 --> 26:49.575
I stand to make
a huge kill on my own.

26:49.676 --> 26:52.278
So you just felt
the urge to share?

26:52.378 --> 26:53.646
Bullshit.

26:53.746 --> 26:55.281
You don't have enough ammo
to do this on your own.

26:55.381 --> 26:56.248
You need us.

26:56.348 --> 26:58.685
We have calendars, too.

26:58.785 --> 27:00.987
You got wacked
by Sansomic.

27:01.087 --> 27:02.254
I bet this deal's
all that stands

27:02.354 --> 27:05.057
between mighty Axe Capital
taking a down quarter.

27:05.157 --> 27:07.226
All we have
to do is flush.

27:07.326 --> 27:11.063
All right, you got me.

27:11.163 --> 27:13.833
This deal only works
if we're all in it together.

27:15.868 --> 27:17.704
The threshold
is five billion.

27:17.804 --> 27:18.805
I'm in it for two.

27:18.905 --> 27:21.774
That leaves one each
for you three.

27:21.874 --> 27:25.611
So, which is the more
powerful driver --

27:25.712 --> 27:27.079
boning me,

27:27.179 --> 27:29.148
or your own
self-interest?

27:30.983 --> 27:33.019
Fuck.

27:33.119 --> 27:35.387
In.

27:35.487 --> 27:37.123
Yep.

27:41.060 --> 27:43.462
This is Everett.

27:43.562 --> 27:45.732
He's gonna run you
through the research.

27:45.832 --> 27:47.633
My treat.

27:47.734 --> 27:50.436
***

28:04.116 --> 28:08.054
Is Mommy coming home
to take us to school?

28:08.154 --> 28:09.521
No, sweetheart.

28:09.621 --> 28:11.523
Remember, I told you.

28:11.623 --> 28:13.893
Mommy and Daddy are spending
some time apart for awhile.

28:13.993 --> 28:18.097
So, I'm home now,
and Mommy will be home tonight.

28:20.332 --> 28:22.468
Mom doesn't even
want to come home.

28:22.568 --> 28:24.403
That is not true, Kevin.

28:30.276 --> 28:32.011
Look at me.

28:32.111 --> 28:34.146
I don't ever want to hear
you say that again.

28:37.449 --> 28:39.451
It's Daddy's fault

28:39.551 --> 28:41.754
that Mommy and Daddy
aren't together right now.

28:47.026 --> 28:48.861
When you're a kid
your age,

28:48.961 --> 28:51.063
you think that your parents
know everything.

28:51.163 --> 28:54.100
But we don't.
We're not perfect.

28:54.200 --> 28:55.935
You know,
we're just two people

28:56.035 --> 29:00.572
trying and... often failing

29:00.672 --> 29:04.043
to figure out
the best way to be.

29:04.143 --> 29:07.679
And I made some mistakes
along the way.

29:07.780 --> 29:10.850
Mistakes that
we're all paying for.

29:10.950 --> 29:12.819
So if you want
to blame somebody,

29:12.919 --> 29:15.254
blame me, not your mother.

29:21.727 --> 29:24.163
European auto manufactures
use a ton of zinc.

29:25.331 --> 29:27.066
Not a literal ton,
just a hyperbole

29:27.166 --> 29:28.868
for how much
zinc can be found --

29:28.968 --> 29:29.836
Good morning.

29:29.936 --> 29:31.003
Not for you, Bobby.

29:31.103 --> 29:32.271
Someone leaked.

29:32.371 --> 29:34.773
The banks know,
and they've made Nigeria aware.

29:34.874 --> 29:35.942
They're fighting back.

29:36.042 --> 29:37.009
They're gonna raise rates

29:37.109 --> 29:38.845
and prop up
their dog-shit currency?

29:38.945 --> 29:41.613
Looks like it.
Thought you should know.

29:41.713 --> 29:44.683
* dramatic music *

29:55.027 --> 29:56.228
Bobby!

29:56.328 --> 29:57.263
Birch!

29:57.363 --> 29:58.364
Naira's fucked, huh?

29:58.464 --> 29:59.899
But I don't hear panic
in your voice.

29:59.999 --> 30:01.968
Come on. All the panic
got shook out of me

30:02.068 --> 30:03.836
about a year ago
when Chuck Rhoades came calling.

30:03.936 --> 30:05.404
Yeah, I imagine it did.

30:05.504 --> 30:08.440
You know, for the longest time,
I couldn't synthesize it.

30:08.540 --> 30:10.042
How that story came out
in the paper,

30:10.142 --> 30:11.410
how there was
just enough in that article

30:11.510 --> 30:12.979
to bait
the U.S. Attorney's Office.

30:13.079 --> 30:14.480
Yeah, it was a bad beat,
no doubt.

30:14.580 --> 30:16.015
Well, since then,
I've had a lot of time

30:16.115 --> 30:18.617
to just sit and think,

30:18.717 --> 30:20.086
and slowly, it dawned --

30:20.186 --> 30:22.421
If I lost,
someone else must've gained.

30:22.521 --> 30:25.357
So I ran a thousand simulations
a day in my head.

30:25.457 --> 30:28.360
And over and over again, Bobby,
it came back the same.

30:28.460 --> 30:30.662
I was your stalking horse.

30:30.762 --> 30:33.499
You did the transaction.
You left the opening.

30:33.599 --> 30:36.535
It's funny. I was just about
to say the same thing to you.

30:36.635 --> 30:38.104
You left me the opening.

30:38.204 --> 30:40.172
You cost me my business.

30:40.272 --> 30:43.109
Now you're gonna throw me
some deal as an apology?

30:43.209 --> 30:44.543
No.

30:44.643 --> 30:46.545
I'm not that easy.

30:46.645 --> 30:48.480
So instead of betting
against the Naira,

30:48.580 --> 30:50.016
I went the other way.

30:50.116 --> 30:52.484
And I let a few other folks
know what was going down.

30:52.584 --> 30:53.619
Strong move.

30:53.719 --> 30:55.821
Might have done
the same in your spot.

30:58.157 --> 30:59.892
I know you would've, Bobby.

30:59.992 --> 31:02.661
***

31:10.702 --> 31:11.837
Deb!

31:13.505 --> 31:14.606
Yes?

31:14.706 --> 31:15.908
You found me Wags, yet?

31:16.008 --> 31:16.842
Not yet.

31:16.943 --> 31:18.844
Just so
we're communicating,

31:18.945 --> 31:20.579
you know I mean the guy who
works across the hall, right?

31:20.679 --> 31:21.981
Michael Wagner? Wags?

31:22.081 --> 31:23.649
Yeah. I'm sorry.

31:23.749 --> 31:25.417
I'm trying.

31:33.192 --> 31:35.827
I know my research
was right.

31:35.928 --> 31:37.129
I also know
it doesn't matter now,

31:37.229 --> 31:38.830
'cause the game
has changed.

31:38.931 --> 31:40.732
How strong
is Nigeria defending?

31:40.832 --> 31:42.801
It's their version
of the Alamo.

31:42.901 --> 31:45.271
Krakow and Malverne are
gonna be looking to pull out.

31:45.371 --> 31:46.939
You should, too.

31:47.039 --> 31:48.207
I don't want
my second day here ending

31:48.307 --> 31:50.409
with you personally exposed
five billion.

31:50.509 --> 31:53.412
Okay, let's say I manage
to keep it together.

31:53.512 --> 31:55.982
Then you're looking
at a global cockfight.

31:56.082 --> 31:58.084
And you're gonna need people
betting on your bird.

31:58.184 --> 31:59.851
I'm gonna need
to get word out wide.

31:59.952 --> 32:01.053
Yeah, can't just be you.

32:01.153 --> 32:02.721
It's gonna have to be
somebody vaunted,

32:02.821 --> 32:06.592
an economist --
somebody objective, trusted.

32:06.692 --> 32:08.360
That'll say
they have to devalue.

32:08.460 --> 32:11.263
Someone like
Lawrence Boyd?

32:11.363 --> 32:13.165
Right.

32:13.265 --> 32:14.600
Yeah, that'll do it.

32:14.700 --> 32:17.936
* dramatic music *

32:18.037 --> 32:20.406
I don't want you to worry
about being too tough on me.

32:20.506 --> 32:21.407
All right?

32:30.716 --> 32:33.185
Posture up,
posture up.

32:39.391 --> 32:42.094
I'm sorry, but is
that a Swiss accent?

32:42.194 --> 32:44.330
Stop it.
No one guesses correctly.

32:44.430 --> 32:46.298
Most people just assume
I'm German.

32:46.398 --> 32:48.334
Oh, most people
didn't spend the summer

32:48.434 --> 32:50.169
in Zurich
during law school.

32:50.269 --> 32:51.403
Oh!

32:51.503 --> 32:53.139
That explains the suit.

32:53.239 --> 32:54.806
You're a lawyer.

32:54.906 --> 32:57.076
She said with
an undertone of derision.

32:58.310 --> 33:00.279
And what do you do
that's so amazing?

33:00.379 --> 33:03.382
At the moment,
you could call me a sculptor.

33:03.482 --> 33:05.384
Oh!

33:05.484 --> 33:08.954
Well, I'd like
to see your work.

33:09.055 --> 33:10.689
One day I'll show you.

33:12.924 --> 33:14.893
Yes.

33:14.993 --> 33:16.895
Axe, I didn't
walk into that diner

33:16.995 --> 33:19.131
so that I could lose
a billion bucks.

33:19.231 --> 33:20.332
You want out?

33:20.432 --> 33:21.700
I'll take on
your positions.

33:21.800 --> 33:23.069
Right now.

33:23.169 --> 33:25.437
I already bought up what was
supposed to be Birch's.

33:25.537 --> 33:26.972
Now I'll buy up
both of you.

33:27.073 --> 33:28.340
You just say the word.

33:28.440 --> 33:31.610
You'd be risking half
your net worth for the one play?

33:31.710 --> 33:32.578
That's insane.

33:32.678 --> 33:35.047
I am dug the fuck in.

33:35.147 --> 33:37.883
No third-world nation
hinged on a dying industry

33:37.983 --> 33:39.218
and a propped-up currency

33:39.318 --> 33:41.220
is gonna ride me
out of my position.

33:41.320 --> 33:44.090
I will drive them
into the goddamn ground.

33:44.190 --> 33:47.093
Without Birch.
Without either of you.

33:48.694 --> 33:50.529
Wow.

33:50.629 --> 33:53.365
The intensity.

33:53.465 --> 33:54.866
I actually believe you.

33:57.236 --> 33:58.770
So?

33:59.905 --> 34:01.673
Fuck it.
I'm sticking.

34:02.974 --> 34:04.543
Me too.

34:06.545 --> 34:10.649
But, Axe, if this is some move,
some game you're playing,

34:10.749 --> 34:12.584
we'll hunt you in a pack

34:12.684 --> 34:15.487
until we're gnawing
on your fucking bones.

34:28.367 --> 34:30.402
Hello, Mr. Allerd.

34:30.502 --> 34:31.670
Here?

34:31.770 --> 34:35.241
None of them
come here, believe me.

34:35.341 --> 34:36.542
Lay out what you have.

34:36.642 --> 34:40.512
The office is a fiefdom
run on fear,

34:40.612 --> 34:43.449
ambition,
and advancement.

34:43.549 --> 34:46.785
Probably why it's
been so effective.

34:46.885 --> 34:48.920
Loyalties are fading.

34:49.020 --> 34:51.423
Cracks starting to show.

34:51.523 --> 34:54.126
I've interviewed almost everyone
but Rhoades at this point.

34:54.226 --> 34:56.195
I'll get to him last.

34:56.295 --> 34:58.330
This has been --

34:58.430 --> 35:00.432
It's been
a fascinating one.

35:00.532 --> 35:02.568
There are those who are weak
but don't have it,

35:02.668 --> 35:06.572
and those who have it
but are strong.

35:06.672 --> 35:08.407
I've isolated the one
who has it

35:08.507 --> 35:12.311
and will give it --
Watley.

35:12.411 --> 35:13.879
He's been running
an avoidance play,

35:13.979 --> 35:17.183
but that's at its end.

35:17.283 --> 35:19.151
I'll push
for a suspension

35:19.251 --> 35:22.721
if that's what it takes
to sit him down.

35:22.821 --> 35:25.791
There's plenty
of support out there.

35:25.891 --> 35:29.428
The AG wants this,
and soon.

35:29.528 --> 35:32.731
You'll have it.

35:32.831 --> 35:35.000
I will if
you say I will.

35:35.100 --> 35:37.903
Thank you, sir.

35:38.003 --> 35:42.073
Something I learned when
I was working under Mondale --

35:42.174 --> 35:44.210
take a little piece
of yourself,

35:44.310 --> 35:46.178
tuck it away
in the basement.

35:46.278 --> 35:48.614
You can give the rest
to the job,

35:48.714 --> 35:51.383
but keep a small piece.

35:52.651 --> 35:54.520
I speak from experience.

35:56.855 --> 35:59.191
Noted.

36:13.505 --> 36:15.741
I find myself thinking
in your words sometimes.

36:15.841 --> 36:18.744
The two that just came to me
are "shit hole."

36:18.844 --> 36:20.412
Sandicot.

36:20.512 --> 36:23.081
If they don't get the casino,
then we have to pass on it.

36:23.181 --> 36:25.251
Even if all that urban
revitalization bullshit

36:25.351 --> 36:26.252
comes into effect?

36:26.352 --> 36:27.853
That'll make
incremental change,

36:27.953 --> 36:29.855
but not fast enough
and not big enough.

36:29.955 --> 36:31.990
Without that casino, it goes
from something to consider

36:32.090 --> 36:33.792
to something
to never think about again.

36:33.892 --> 36:34.860
I see that.

36:34.960 --> 36:36.328
Fuck.

36:41.733 --> 36:43.735
I'm gonna carpet-bomb you guys
with so much fucking food,

36:43.835 --> 36:44.936
you'll be reeling.

36:45.036 --> 36:45.904
Thanks, David.

36:46.004 --> 36:47.138
Don't thank me.

36:47.239 --> 36:48.874
Just be there for us
when Fugu goes public.

36:48.974 --> 36:50.376
Absolutely.

36:52.978 --> 36:55.347
I know when someone's
working me.

36:55.447 --> 36:57.082
What's your play here?

36:57.182 --> 36:59.117
The bond.

36:59.217 --> 37:01.853
If your casino is going
to the town I need it to.

37:01.953 --> 37:03.989
And because
we're friends,

37:04.089 --> 37:05.991
I'm gonna come across
with that info?

37:06.091 --> 37:07.025
I was hoping.

37:07.125 --> 37:09.961
A '69 Dodge Challenger.

37:10.061 --> 37:12.631
The one I outbid you for
at Barrett Jackson last summer?

37:17.102 --> 37:19.905
It's parked outside.
Here.

37:20.005 --> 37:23.342
***

37:23.442 --> 37:24.643
The car

37:24.743 --> 37:28.980
is a cute gesture.

37:29.080 --> 37:30.181
And I'll take it.

37:31.917 --> 37:33.452
But it alone,

37:33.552 --> 37:35.821
it's not getting you
what you want.

37:37.155 --> 37:40.559
My casino's gonna
make that town, so...

37:40.659 --> 37:43.094
I'm your partner
on the muni-play.

37:45.063 --> 37:47.433
On a no-risk basis
to me.

37:47.533 --> 37:50.936
5% off the books.

37:51.036 --> 37:52.904
Done.

37:53.004 --> 37:54.406
I just need
to know where.

37:54.506 --> 37:56.408
Sandicot.

37:56.508 --> 37:58.910
Still waiting on
the official decision

37:59.010 --> 38:02.614
to come out of committee,
but they gave me the high sign,

38:02.714 --> 38:05.250
so I know
it's a done deal.

38:06.818 --> 38:08.987
You casino guys
are all old-line crooks.

38:09.087 --> 38:12.758
At least we wear it
with pride.

38:12.858 --> 38:14.993
Move forward
with the bond.

38:15.093 --> 38:17.128
The casino
is coming to Sandicot.

38:17.228 --> 38:18.564
I'm sure now.

38:18.664 --> 38:20.466
We are committing to this play.

38:25.537 --> 38:27.272
You have to tell me
how it is.

38:27.373 --> 38:28.807
You want a bite?

38:28.907 --> 38:31.943
Well, one bite would be
like drowning in a puddle.

38:32.043 --> 38:34.346
I'm sure the kitchen
would do one up for you.

38:34.446 --> 38:36.047
Well,
he's eating clean.

38:37.115 --> 38:39.618
McKinnon's coming up.

38:42.253 --> 38:43.855
Hey.

38:43.955 --> 38:45.891
Right.
You feeling ready, Tom?

38:45.991 --> 38:47.826
Yeah, yeah, I'm good.

38:47.926 --> 38:49.961
Probably should get
back down to the bar.

38:50.061 --> 38:52.097
They're about to seat us.

38:52.197 --> 38:53.499
We only get
one shot at this.

38:54.633 --> 38:56.902
Now, remember --
any chance you get

38:57.002 --> 38:59.237
to have a private conversation
with Boyd, take it.

38:59.337 --> 39:01.339
Express concerns about
the bid rigging.

39:01.440 --> 39:03.341
Make it clear that you
know it's going on,

39:03.442 --> 39:04.776
and you're worried
that Mike Arendt

39:04.876 --> 39:07.546
is bringing heat
on the firm.

39:07.646 --> 39:09.681
That should be enough
to get him to calm your fears.

39:09.781 --> 39:12.551
I might go across the table
at that motherfucker.

39:12.651 --> 39:14.820
Steady, Tom.

39:14.920 --> 39:16.221
This'll hurt him
a lot worse

39:16.321 --> 39:18.524
and a lot longer
than a punch in the mouth.

39:21.026 --> 39:22.561
Use it well.

39:25.564 --> 39:26.865
How's the feed?

39:26.965 --> 39:27.799
Good to go.

39:27.899 --> 39:28.834
Okay.

39:37.676 --> 39:40.412
Forty-five dollars
for a tuna sandwich.

39:40.512 --> 39:42.047
Somebody bring the drinks.

39:42.147 --> 39:44.416
Two at the bar.
That's his third.

39:44.516 --> 39:46.084
It's lemony.

39:46.184 --> 39:49.354
It's an island. Everything has
to be brought on by boat.

39:49.455 --> 39:50.989
I know Mustique
is an island.

39:51.089 --> 39:51.990
Okay.

39:52.090 --> 39:53.592
So what'd
you do, Larry?

39:53.692 --> 39:55.160
I said, "What do you
charge for the lemons?

39:55.260 --> 39:56.495
I'll squeeze them myself.

39:56.595 --> 39:58.764
Either that, or I'll fly
in a load of gold bullion."

39:59.831 --> 40:02.801
Larry, Larry,
don't -- don't cry poor.

40:02.901 --> 40:04.235
How much you take in this year
so far?

40:04.335 --> 40:05.571
Come on. Tell us.

40:05.671 --> 40:07.839
Twenty-three,
$24 million?

40:07.939 --> 40:09.475
Maybe you've had enough,
huh, Tom?

40:09.575 --> 40:11.943
Can we get Tom a cup
of black coffee, please?

40:13.178 --> 40:15.146
I don't want
a cup of fucking coffee.

40:15.246 --> 40:17.048
He's drunk.
We should pull him.

40:17.148 --> 40:18.650
We've got an agent
posing as a waiter.

40:18.750 --> 40:20.418
We can pull him right now
with minimal damage.

40:20.519 --> 40:22.488
We'll hold.

40:22.588 --> 40:24.490
* dramatic music *

40:24.590 --> 40:27.025
With Thai massage,
you're wearing clothes.

40:27.125 --> 40:29.561
What's the fun in that?

40:30.896 --> 40:32.430
Exactly.

40:32.531 --> 40:35.767
Larry. Larry, you fuck.

40:35.867 --> 40:36.968
-Oh.
-Sh-- shh...

40:37.068 --> 40:38.136
It's probably
going to stain that.

40:38.236 --> 40:39.905
Uh, bad to fucking worse.

40:40.972 --> 40:42.741
Honey, take her
to the ladies'.

40:42.841 --> 40:44.943
Yeah, why don't
you freshen up?

40:46.778 --> 40:50.115
Tom, get your shit together.
You're embarrassing yourself.

40:51.917 --> 40:53.919
You think I don't know
what's going on here?

40:58.156 --> 40:59.691
What's that, Tom?

40:59.791 --> 41:02.360
* suspenseful music *

41:06.464 --> 41:08.299
Arendt is putting us
all in danger.

41:08.399 --> 41:09.768
The Treasury bonds --

41:09.868 --> 41:12.337
He's gonna send us
all to prison.

41:12.437 --> 41:15.273
The ten-years.

41:15.373 --> 41:17.208
That's what
this is about.

41:17.308 --> 41:19.578
Mike's putting
the band back together again,

41:19.678 --> 41:22.047
just like I told him to.

41:22.147 --> 41:25.416
Fuck, you told him to?

41:25.517 --> 41:27.085
I thought
he was free-balling.

41:27.185 --> 41:29.387
Conditions are right
to get going again.

41:29.487 --> 41:30.989
We'll tail the shit
out of the auction.

41:31.089 --> 41:33.158
The fucking Feds
can spare the 15 bips.

41:33.258 --> 41:35.694
Then we can talk
about the 26-weeks.

41:35.794 --> 41:38.429
We have to get
some volume going now.

41:38.530 --> 41:40.532
So relax.

41:40.632 --> 41:42.834
That'll do it.

41:49.240 --> 41:53.178
When I started here,
I made a promise to you,

41:53.278 --> 41:55.914
and you to me.

41:56.014 --> 41:59.450
And we've kept that
promise no matter what.

41:59.551 --> 42:01.219
Thing is, it's not
your turn to speak.

42:01.319 --> 42:02.621
Why's that?

42:02.721 --> 42:04.856
Because while you have been
out there learning the Yaqui Way

42:04.956 --> 42:06.658
or how run
like the Tarahumara,

42:06.758 --> 42:08.193
I have been here
fighting the battle

42:08.293 --> 42:10.796
of fucking Thermopylae!

42:10.896 --> 42:14.132
I was in sessions with Wendy,
doing deep work.

42:14.232 --> 42:15.834
Oh.

42:15.934 --> 42:18.269
Well, that I do
want to hear about.

42:19.938 --> 42:22.808
Best I can
put it together...

42:22.908 --> 42:27.478
* distorted country music *

42:33.652 --> 42:36.354
Wags, wake up.
Get up.

42:36.454 --> 42:38.023
Oh, baby, no!

42:38.123 --> 42:39.591
No, not baby.
It's Wendy.

42:39.691 --> 42:40.692
Get up!

42:45.931 --> 42:47.065
Why?

42:47.165 --> 42:49.067
Because you begged me
for an appointment,

42:49.167 --> 42:50.335
and then
you didn't show up.

42:53.571 --> 42:55.907
Oh, you're still here.

42:56.007 --> 42:57.508
No, I'm not.

42:57.609 --> 43:00.145
I'm here,
but not like that.

43:00.245 --> 43:01.512
Okay.

43:01.613 --> 43:04.616
Mr. Wagner, I can come back
at 11:30 or two or after five.

43:04.716 --> 43:06.384
She has a key?

43:06.484 --> 43:07.819
Why not?

43:07.919 --> 43:11.289
You have a goddamned I.V. stand
living in your hotel room.

43:11.389 --> 43:13.324
Turns out you
have the day off.

43:13.424 --> 43:15.994
With pay.

43:18.296 --> 43:20.398
This is your
third divorce,

43:20.498 --> 43:22.834
but your first
ass tattoo.

43:22.934 --> 43:24.703
Any ideas?

43:24.803 --> 43:29.074
My idea was the drinking, women,
and drugs in perfect balance.

43:29.174 --> 43:31.209
An infinite Zen garden.

43:31.309 --> 43:35.013
Simplicity, harmony
between the elements, purity,

43:35.113 --> 43:37.716
that's what makes it
a Zen garden.

43:37.816 --> 43:40.786
I think you're confusing it
with the AVN Awards.

43:40.886 --> 43:42.253
Okay.

43:42.353 --> 43:44.723
Couple ways
this can go --

43:44.823 --> 43:46.792
We do, like,
intense psychotherapy

43:46.892 --> 43:49.795
for two years,
five days a week,

43:49.895 --> 43:51.029
break down your walls,

43:51.129 --> 43:53.699
push past your rationalizations
and defenses.

43:53.799 --> 43:56.702
Or you can tell me
what the fuck is going on.

43:56.802 --> 43:58.569
How?

43:58.670 --> 44:00.305
Isn't the point of analysis
that we don't know?

44:00.405 --> 44:01.673
Which is why
I'm not in that racket.

44:01.773 --> 44:03.975
We don't have that
kind of fucking time.

44:04.075 --> 44:05.443
Not anymore.

44:05.543 --> 44:06.845
Fucking right we don't.

44:06.945 --> 44:10.749
I got a goddamned I.V. stand
living in my hotel room.

44:10.849 --> 44:12.450
Good.

44:13.885 --> 44:16.654
Now, whatever caused this
didn't make you retreat.

44:16.755 --> 44:19.390
You didn't become depressive.
You chose distraction.

44:19.490 --> 44:20.959
I'm sad, lonely.

44:21.059 --> 44:22.427
Give me
an immediate answer.

44:22.527 --> 44:24.763
I mean, it doesn't have to be
right, just -- just blurt it.

44:24.863 --> 44:26.264
When did this feeling
first land?

44:27.966 --> 44:29.968
I was in the bathroom.

44:30.068 --> 44:33.038
I was in this club
on the Lower East Side.

44:33.138 --> 44:34.272
I just overpaid

44:34.372 --> 44:36.742
for what were supposed
to be actual quaaludes.

44:36.842 --> 44:38.744
What were you doing
on the Lower East Side?

44:38.844 --> 44:41.679
Drinking with this prick
I worked with years ago.

44:41.780 --> 44:42.948
God, I hated that prick.

44:43.048 --> 44:45.083
I hated him
when we worked together.

44:45.183 --> 44:47.085
I hated him even more
that night.

44:47.185 --> 44:49.054
Why did you agree to drink
with a guy you hate?

44:49.154 --> 44:51.322
I drink with pricks
I hate all the time.

44:51.422 --> 44:52.924
It's the job.

44:53.024 --> 44:56.661
It's the ones who aren't
that stand out like giants.

44:59.097 --> 45:01.733
Holy shit.

45:01.833 --> 45:04.535
Holy shit. Phil.

45:04.635 --> 45:06.437
I can't believe
I missed this.

45:06.537 --> 45:08.273
Phil?

45:08.373 --> 45:09.841
Phillip Carroll.

45:09.941 --> 45:10.876
Another prick?

45:10.976 --> 45:12.310
No.

45:12.410 --> 45:14.512
No, the opposite.

45:14.612 --> 45:17.115
Guy was my mentor.

45:17.215 --> 45:20.051
Back when
I started at Lehman.

45:20.151 --> 45:21.652
He was
the Wilt fucking Chamberlain

45:21.753 --> 45:22.888
of Wall Street.

45:22.988 --> 45:25.523
Paid for the whole group's
vacations when he killed it.

45:25.623 --> 45:27.358
Didn't even close his door
when he got crushed.

45:27.458 --> 45:29.227
I saw him on the street.

45:29.327 --> 45:31.096
Hey, Phil!

45:31.196 --> 45:34.966
He looked at me, and I waved.

45:35.066 --> 45:36.434
He walked right past me.

45:36.534 --> 45:39.537
Fucking DK'd me
like I was a ghost.

45:44.642 --> 45:47.979
Turns out, he has
early-onset Alzheimer's.

45:51.082 --> 45:53.618
Can't even go out
by himself now.

45:55.420 --> 45:58.824
His wife left him.
His kids don't come around.

45:58.924 --> 46:01.692
It was... fucked.

46:03.761 --> 46:08.266
He was there,
but he wasn't there...

46:08.366 --> 46:12.938
a carcass
with no further purpose.

46:13.038 --> 46:16.607
What you saw would have
brought up issues of mortality

46:16.707 --> 46:18.944
and diminished utility
for anyone.

46:19.044 --> 46:21.612
You saw your hero,

46:21.712 --> 46:24.850
a man you deemed
better than you, laid low.

46:26.217 --> 46:28.719
That's empathy.

46:28.820 --> 46:30.421
Why did his plight
cut you so deep?

46:30.521 --> 46:33.491
What made you so vulnerable
to this idea of fading away?

46:35.626 --> 46:38.563
Axe hired a fucking
Chief of Staff.

46:38.663 --> 46:40.365
Her name is Steph Reed.

46:42.433 --> 46:43.835
Oh.

46:45.636 --> 46:47.973
So now he doesn't need you
anymore.

46:50.976 --> 46:54.145
And if he doesn't need you
anymore,

46:54.245 --> 46:55.914
no one does.

46:57.248 --> 47:00.418
You have outlived
your utility.

47:00.518 --> 47:04.522
There is nothing left
for you to do but die.

47:09.294 --> 47:12.597
But you're not dead.

47:12.697 --> 47:16.301
Which means
it is time to pivot.

47:16.401 --> 47:20.205
To evolve into what it is
you'll become next.

47:24.642 --> 47:28.980
Wendy reassembled me,
piece by piece,

47:29.080 --> 47:30.715
on that bench.

47:30.815 --> 47:33.518
That's what she does.

47:33.618 --> 47:35.153
And I decided I had
to give you the chance

47:35.253 --> 47:37.655
to make the change here
you need to.

47:37.755 --> 47:42.360
To modernize.
Optimize.

47:42.460 --> 47:44.963
To put this old horse
out to pasture.

47:47.232 --> 47:50.001
Yeah, well,
I'm sorry about Phil,

47:50.101 --> 47:53.939
but this place doesn't
fucking run without you.

47:54.039 --> 47:56.041
I do need you.

47:56.141 --> 47:58.509
Especially since I just
let Steph Reed go.

48:00.078 --> 48:02.147
You did?

48:02.247 --> 48:03.982
You were wrong.

48:04.082 --> 48:06.985
I'm not human.
I am a machine.

48:07.085 --> 48:08.853
I'm a fucking Terminator.

48:11.489 --> 48:13.858
So, your resignation
is rejected.

48:13.959 --> 48:15.293
Get some coffee.

48:15.393 --> 48:17.462
We are barely
hanging on here.

48:17.562 --> 48:20.465
I just pulled the trigger
on the muni-bond in Sandicot,

48:20.565 --> 48:22.167
and I got one move left
to get us

48:22.267 --> 48:24.102
into the black
for this quarter.

48:24.202 --> 48:28.373
* dramatic music *

48:31.342 --> 48:33.044
Coffee!

48:33.144 --> 48:35.846
Hey, Jeff.

48:35.947 --> 48:37.949
You never
finished your story.

48:38.049 --> 48:39.550
What trap did you
and your father use

48:39.650 --> 48:41.019
to finally get
that wolf?

48:41.119 --> 48:43.054
Oh.

48:43.154 --> 48:46.958
Yeah,
it was, uh, time, Sacker.

48:47.058 --> 48:49.660
We stayed in
the same location all day.

48:49.760 --> 48:53.431
The trap was time.

49:00.571 --> 49:01.973
Oh.

49:02.073 --> 49:04.509
Late night?

49:04.609 --> 49:07.345
Yeah.
And I'm on the move.

49:07.445 --> 49:10.015
Got television in the city
in a couple hours.

49:10.115 --> 49:11.216
On your way in,

49:11.316 --> 49:13.251
give Lawrence Boyd
a call for me.

49:13.351 --> 49:15.486
I'll be with him.
What's up?

49:15.586 --> 49:19.157
Tell him the woman he set me up
with wasted my fucking time.

49:19.257 --> 49:20.391
I'm sorry?

49:20.491 --> 49:22.860
It was
a bullshit meeting.

49:22.960 --> 49:24.395
You're a businesswoman,
right?

49:24.495 --> 49:25.396
That's how
you went in there?

49:25.496 --> 49:26.797
Damn right.

49:26.897 --> 49:28.266
Well, then,
was the woman discourteous?

49:28.366 --> 49:29.567
Was she rude?

49:29.667 --> 49:31.802
No. It wasn't --

49:33.804 --> 49:36.607
She treated me like
I was just the wife,

49:36.707 --> 49:38.209
like my business
wasn't ready.

49:38.309 --> 49:39.644
I tried to tell you.

49:39.744 --> 49:41.046
Yeah, you weren't ready,

49:41.146 --> 49:43.181
but you wouldn't
hear it from me.

49:43.281 --> 49:44.882
You put me in touch
with Spartan-Ives.

49:44.982 --> 49:47.118
You said to go ahead.
Don't. Don't.

49:47.218 --> 49:48.553
I don't have time
to have this conversation

49:48.653 --> 49:49.487
the way you need me to.

49:49.587 --> 49:50.755
You weren't ready.

49:50.855 --> 49:52.057
Leave it there.

49:52.157 --> 49:53.391
Why the fuck not?

49:55.926 --> 49:59.130
What is it that you do that
you're the best in the world at?

49:59.230 --> 50:01.032
You offer a service
you didn't invent,

50:01.132 --> 50:02.733
a formula
you didn't invent,

50:02.833 --> 50:04.902
a delivery method
you didn't invent.

50:05.002 --> 50:06.771
Nothing about
what you do

50:06.871 --> 50:09.540
is patentable
or a unique user experience.

50:09.640 --> 50:12.477
You haven't identified
an isolated market segment,

50:12.577 --> 50:14.079
haven't truly branded
your concept.

50:14.179 --> 50:15.713
You need me to go on?

50:15.813 --> 50:18.516
So, why would an investment bank
put serious money into it?

50:18.616 --> 50:20.251
I all but told you
ahead of time,

50:20.351 --> 50:21.419
but you wouldn't listen.

50:21.519 --> 50:24.455
Now you've heard it,
but it's too late.

50:24.555 --> 50:27.492
You weren't ready.

50:29.960 --> 50:31.296
Now, I gotta go
into New York

50:31.396 --> 50:33.998
to try and save
my fucking quarter.

50:43.441 --> 50:44.842
Mr. Axelrod,
I'll be in to get you

50:44.942 --> 50:46.144
in two minutes
to go on the air.

50:46.244 --> 50:49.514
Thank you.
And thank you, Larry.

50:49.614 --> 50:51.282
You locked in on
how you want to do it?

50:51.382 --> 50:53.751
Yeah.

50:53.851 --> 50:56.454
When I follow you on,
I'll back whatever you said.

51:02.993 --> 51:05.296
Former teaching
assistant of mine

51:05.396 --> 51:07.031
clerks for
a federal judge now.

51:07.132 --> 51:08.399
Uh-huh?

51:08.499 --> 51:09.700
She just told me
that her judge

51:09.800 --> 51:12.069
signed an arrest warrant
for Lawrence Boyd.

51:12.170 --> 51:14.705
* dramatic music *

51:14.805 --> 51:17.542
They are coming for him.

51:17.642 --> 51:20.178
He'll be in cuffs
within the hour.

51:22.880 --> 51:24.349
Thank you.

51:28.052 --> 51:29.654
Ready?

51:31.889 --> 51:33.724
Yeah.

51:42.133 --> 51:43.934
Go get 'em.

51:46.671 --> 51:48.673
I will.

51:48.773 --> 51:52.243
***

52:00.785 --> 52:01.919
Axe.

52:02.019 --> 52:04.389
Let's do dinner again soon
with Savannah and Mike.

52:04.489 --> 52:05.823
Huh?

52:05.923 --> 52:08.226
When we're on, I have to get
into all the action

52:08.326 --> 52:10.828
against you
on the Nigerian play.

52:12.930 --> 52:14.965
You okay?

52:15.065 --> 52:16.033
Yeah.

52:17.502 --> 52:19.737
Will you ask me
about my bracelet?

52:19.837 --> 52:22.072
Fun way in.

52:22.173 --> 52:24.074
We're pleased
to welcome Bobby Axelrod,

52:24.175 --> 52:26.377
the principal and founder
of Axe Capital.

52:26.477 --> 52:27.778
Bobby, it's a pleasure
to have you here.

52:27.878 --> 52:28.879
It's a pleasure
to be here, Sam.

52:28.979 --> 52:30.781
Before we get started,
I have to ask --

52:30.881 --> 52:32.750
You're wearing
a very unique bracelet.

52:32.850 --> 52:34.118
What's the significance?

52:34.219 --> 52:35.953
Oh, this?

52:36.053 --> 52:38.556
I wear this Yoruba
bracelet in solidarity

52:38.656 --> 52:40.958
with the people
of Nigeria.

52:41.058 --> 52:43.994
I have seen the hope
and purpose these people have,

52:44.094 --> 52:45.763
and today I'm worried
for them, Sam.

52:45.863 --> 52:47.932
Their economy is
on the verge of collapse.

52:48.032 --> 52:51.469
Their oil reserves
are severely overvalued.

52:51.569 --> 52:54.805
In short, their currency
is in jeopardy.

52:54.905 --> 52:58.609
***

53:03.914 --> 53:06.851
And so, yes, there is
no doubt in my mind

53:06.951 --> 53:09.587
that my good friend,
Bobby Axelrod,

53:09.687 --> 53:11.322
has this one right.

53:11.422 --> 53:13.824
The Nigerian currency,
the Naira,

53:13.924 --> 53:16.126
is facing
certain devaluation.

53:16.227 --> 53:17.862
It's their only choice,

53:17.962 --> 53:20.164
no matter how much
it hurts the people.

53:20.265 --> 53:22.467
I can see that.

53:23.634 --> 53:25.670
***

53:32.977 --> 53:34.144
We nailed that.

53:34.245 --> 53:37.181
The old Malachi Crunch.

53:37.282 --> 53:38.749
The market
is shifting already.

53:38.849 --> 53:40.150
It is done.

53:40.251 --> 53:42.019
Yes, it is.

53:42.119 --> 53:43.521
Larry...

53:45.823 --> 53:47.825
in a few moments,

53:47.925 --> 53:50.828
the FBI are gonna come
walking through that door

53:50.928 --> 53:52.997
and they're going
to arrest you.

53:53.097 --> 53:54.999
You can't run.

53:55.099 --> 53:57.134
There's no time.

53:57.234 --> 54:01.772
***

54:01.872 --> 54:05.943
Rhoades fucked me
like you thought he would.

54:06.043 --> 54:07.378
And you got the call

54:07.478 --> 54:09.647
before you went on,
didn't you?

54:09.747 --> 54:12.783
Your whole manner changed.
You didn't even warn me.

54:12.883 --> 54:13.918
I couldn't.

54:14.018 --> 54:15.453
Because you needed me
to go on the air

54:15.553 --> 54:17.154
to corroborate
your story,

54:17.254 --> 54:20.090
get your message out,
save your quarter.

54:23.127 --> 54:25.963
I get it.
It was smart.

54:27.432 --> 54:32.169
This is some fucked-up universe
we've decided to live in.

54:32.269 --> 54:33.571
How can I help now?

54:36.173 --> 54:38.843
Hold this for me.

54:38.943 --> 54:41.145
And I need you
to get word to my lawyer.

54:41.245 --> 54:42.547
And Linda?

54:44.281 --> 54:45.583
Make sure
she tells the kids

54:45.683 --> 54:48.553
before they find out
from the news.

54:48.653 --> 54:49.987
Done.

54:50.087 --> 54:52.623
***

54:56.461 --> 54:57.428
Larry.

54:57.528 --> 54:59.296
I know.

54:59.397 --> 55:00.698
Lawrence Boyd?

55:00.798 --> 55:02.500
You're under arrest.

55:02.600 --> 55:04.268
You have the right
to remain silent.

55:04.369 --> 55:06.671
Anything you say can
and will be used against you

55:06.771 --> 55:07.638
in a court of law.

55:12.176 --> 55:15.245
I thought you were ready
to take the next step.

55:15.346 --> 55:17.848
I thought you understood
the goddamn game.

55:18.849 --> 55:21.118
Oh, I believe I do, sir.

55:23.287 --> 55:25.456
I believe I do.

55:31.396 --> 55:32.863
Hello, Bob.

55:32.963 --> 55:36.634
I don't put any stock
in omens or fortune tellers,

55:36.734 --> 55:39.470
but this must feel

55:39.570 --> 55:42.640
a little like
your future foretold, huh?

55:42.740 --> 55:44.775
You mean watching
you arrest other people

55:44.875 --> 55:46.544
while I walk
right out the door?

55:46.644 --> 55:48.846
Yeah. Kinda does.

56:11.402 --> 56:14.772
* In my time *

56:16.874 --> 56:21.579
* If they gave gold statuettes *

56:21.679 --> 56:25.483
* For tears and regret *

56:25.583 --> 56:28.352
* I'd be a legend *

56:28.453 --> 56:31.956
* In my time *

56:34.291 --> 56:38.763
* But they don't give awards *

56:38.863 --> 56:43.233
* And there's no praise
or fame *

56:43.333 --> 56:47.438
* For hearts that are broken *

56:47.538 --> 56:50.941
* For love that's in vain *

56:51.041 --> 56:55.012
* If loneliness
meant world acclaim *
