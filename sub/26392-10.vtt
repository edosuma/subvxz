WEBVTT

00:04.004 --> 00:05.570
Ooh, Jake, look--

00:05.614 --> 00:07.355
that must be the girl Cooper
brought home last night.

00:07.398 --> 00:09.879
Ooh... And he must be
upstairs preparing

00:09.922 --> 00:11.663
his customary
one-night stand gift bag.

00:11.707 --> 00:13.056
[chuckles]

00:14.666 --> 00:16.929
Hi, you must be
Jake and Claire.

00:16.973 --> 00:18.496
I'’m Sara.CLAIRE: Hey.

00:18.540 --> 00:20.542
[chuckles]

00:20.585 --> 00:22.065
Is it weird to offer you pants?

00:24.807 --> 00:26.026
Yeah, yeah, I probably
just made it weird

00:26.069 --> 00:27.070
by asking you that.
[laughs]

00:28.419 --> 00:29.855
All that to say
there are pants

00:29.899 --> 00:31.988
if you want them.

00:32.032 --> 00:33.424
JAKE:
All right, babe.

00:33.468 --> 00:35.774
Chill out, chill out.
I-I got this.

00:35.818 --> 00:38.255
So, uh, how did you
and Cooper meet?

00:38.299 --> 00:39.822
Is this a Tinder miracle
or, uh...

00:41.606 --> 00:43.086
Or was it
the old-fashioned way,

00:43.130 --> 00:45.045
when a roadie comes up and puts
a sticker on your shirt?

00:45.088 --> 00:46.263
[chuckles]

00:46.307 --> 00:48.657
Well, I'’ve known Cooper
for years.

00:48.700 --> 00:52.095
In fact, I might know him
better than he knows himself.

00:52.139 --> 00:54.010
Oh.Do you want
an omelet?

00:54.054 --> 00:56.012
Ooh, girl, you trying to flirt
with me in front of my wife?

00:58.449 --> 00:59.537
[laughs]Stop.

00:59.581 --> 01:01.496
Where is Cooper, anyway?

01:01.539 --> 01:04.064
He just looked so cute sleeping,
I didn'’t want to wake him.

01:04.107 --> 01:07.023
Probably tuckered out
from all that s...

01:08.459 --> 01:10.287
...sex.

01:12.724 --> 01:13.986
I tried to bail on it,
but I couldn'’t

01:14.030 --> 01:15.684
-think of another word.
-Yeah.

01:15.727 --> 01:17.077
He really couldn'’t,
'’cause, I mean,

01:17.120 --> 01:19.644
his dirty talk
is just him going "Whee!"

01:22.343 --> 01:24.258
I'’ll-I'll go get Cooper.

01:24.301 --> 01:25.302
I'’ll go sit down.Yeah.

01:26.738 --> 01:28.827
G'’day.Hey. I was just

01:28.871 --> 01:31.569
coming to get you. Uh, Sara
is making us breakfast.

01:31.613 --> 01:34.094
Great. Who'’s Sara?

01:37.575 --> 01:39.142
Cooper, if you'’re gonna
have sex with a girl,

01:39.186 --> 01:40.361
you should at least
know her name.

01:42.972 --> 01:44.234
I'’ve never
seen that girl in my life.

01:46.541 --> 01:47.977
Cooper, if you'’re gonna
have sex with a girl,

01:48.020 --> 01:49.413
you should at least
look at her.

01:49.457 --> 01:51.894
No...

01:51.937 --> 01:54.810
Claire, I swear to you, I have
no idea who that person is.

01:54.853 --> 01:57.029
What? She says
she knows you

01:57.073 --> 01:58.161
better than you
know yourself.

01:58.205 --> 01:59.771
and she watched you
sleep, and...

02:05.081 --> 02:07.170
Oh... Oh, my God,
is she a stalker?

02:07.214 --> 02:08.867
Looks like it. I-I'’ll go call
my manager to help.

02:08.911 --> 02:11.000
He'’s always dealing with stuff
like this. In the meantime,

02:11.043 --> 02:14.177
don'’t eat anything she cooks,
and just stay calm.

02:14.221 --> 02:15.657
They'’re usually harmless.What...

02:17.833 --> 02:20.052
Usually?

02:20.096 --> 02:21.837
W-We should call the police.

02:21.880 --> 02:23.447
Don'’t be such a white lady,
Claire.

02:28.409 --> 02:29.671
JAKE:
Claire get in here,
Sara'’s killing me!

02:31.673 --> 02:33.240
With this amazing omelet.

02:33.283 --> 02:34.763
[exclaims]

02:34.806 --> 02:37.244
Mmm, mmm.Hon... Jake.

02:37.287 --> 02:39.115
Jake, this girl
is a stalker.

02:39.159 --> 02:40.334
Hey,

02:40.377 --> 02:42.249
do you have a sharper knife?

02:42.292 --> 02:43.946
Uh...

02:43.989 --> 02:45.382
Hey. Hell yeah, we do.

02:45.426 --> 02:47.384
[laughs]

02:47.428 --> 02:50.561
This one in here is guaranteed
to cut through bone.

02:50.605 --> 02:51.910
[exclaims][laughs]

02:55.827 --> 02:57.916
Ow, you'’re
hurting me.

02:59.309 --> 03:01.268
Jake.

03:01.311 --> 03:03.052
Cooper does not know this woman.

03:03.095 --> 03:05.141
She is a stalker.What?

03:05.185 --> 03:07.056
No way.SARA: Yeah.

03:07.099 --> 03:09.101
"Stalker" implies
I'’m still looking for Cooper.

03:10.581 --> 03:12.017
Now that I'’ve found him,

03:12.061 --> 03:13.802
I'’m never gonna let him go.

03:15.412 --> 03:17.719
Aw... [laughs]

03:17.762 --> 03:20.069
Oh, my God!

03:24.421 --> 03:27.859
♪ Imagine me and you, I do

03:27.903 --> 03:30.645
♪ I think about you
day and night ♪

03:30.688 --> 03:32.255
♪ It'’s only right ♪

03:32.299 --> 03:34.866
♪ So happy together...

03:34.910 --> 03:36.825
[vocalizing]

03:48.663 --> 03:49.620
So, the good news is

03:49.664 --> 03:51.579
Sara has been...

03:51.622 --> 03:53.233
taken care of.

03:54.886 --> 03:57.193
My God, what did you do to her?

03:57.237 --> 03:58.934
We just called her parents,
who made her

03:58.977 --> 03:59.891
come home to North Dakota.

04:03.025 --> 04:04.200
I'’m sorry,
did I make it sound ominous?

04:05.810 --> 04:07.247
It sounded like
you had her killed.

04:10.119 --> 04:12.948
Why does everyone always suspect
me of killing women?

04:12.991 --> 04:13.992
[laughing]

04:16.734 --> 04:20.477
Anyway, now that someone
knows where Cooper lives,

04:20.521 --> 04:23.306
Nightmare and I have a full plan
in place to relocate him.

04:23.350 --> 04:25.526
What? But I love living with
Jake and Claire.

04:25.569 --> 04:27.919
Everyone else treats me
like a painting in a museum.

04:27.963 --> 04:29.486
You know, just stop and stare,

04:29.530 --> 04:30.748
and then if they
try and touch me,

04:30.792 --> 04:32.489
security moves them along.

04:34.404 --> 04:36.624
I don'’t see
why you have to move.

04:36.667 --> 04:38.495
I mean, you have me here
to protect you.

04:43.065 --> 04:46.024
What about installing
a security system?Oh.

04:46.068 --> 04:47.983
Don'’t you have that hookup with
that celebrity security guy?

04:48.026 --> 04:49.637
I do, and he is the best.

04:49.680 --> 04:51.247
My ex-wife used him
and I haven'’t been able

04:51.291 --> 04:52.727
to get in my house since.

04:52.770 --> 04:56.470
Well... well, can you
give me his number?

04:56.513 --> 04:58.167
'’Cause I just hate
the feeling of someone

04:58.210 --> 05:00.169
breaking into our home and
rummaging through our stuff.

05:02.824 --> 05:05.174
Hey guys, next time
you go shopping,

05:05.217 --> 05:07.045
would you get regular milk?

05:07.089 --> 05:09.178
Almond milk
kind of upsets Gerald.

05:09.221 --> 05:10.875
Not stomach-wise,
just the idea of it.

05:13.269 --> 05:15.750
Mom, you guys can'’t just
barge in here whenever you want

05:15.793 --> 05:17.229
and help yourself to our food.

05:17.273 --> 05:19.362
Honey, do you really expect us
to drive all the way

05:19.406 --> 05:21.582
to the grocery store
for just a couple of things?

05:21.625 --> 05:24.193
It'’s not worth our time
or the potential DUI.

05:28.153 --> 05:29.894
Why'’s everyone
look so serious?

05:29.938 --> 05:32.462
Oh, well, one of Cooper'’s
stalkers broke in.

05:32.506 --> 05:34.595
So we'’re actually talking about
installing a security system.

05:34.638 --> 05:37.554
And I'’m trying to tell them
they don'’t need it

05:37.598 --> 05:40.252
because they have me.

05:41.645 --> 05:42.733
[laughs]

05:46.084 --> 05:48.870
Do you really think you'’re
the one to handle this-- you--

05:48.913 --> 05:50.567
the person who was
beaten up by a duck?

05:52.439 --> 05:53.831
It was a goose

05:53.875 --> 05:56.268
and I forgot I had a
sandwich in my pocket.

05:56.312 --> 05:57.487
GERALD: Look...

05:57.531 --> 06:00.055
Jake, if you want
to keep your house safe,

06:00.098 --> 06:01.622
just do what my dad taught me:

06:01.665 --> 06:03.450
be six, five, 250.

06:06.104 --> 06:09.281
Thank you, Gerald, but
I have my own system, okay?

06:09.325 --> 06:11.980
Every night, I put a large
vacuum cleaner by the back door.

06:12.023 --> 06:14.330
That way, if some joker
tries to break in,

06:14.374 --> 06:16.027
he'’ll make a noise,
giving me time

06:16.071 --> 06:17.725
to put on clothes, so he
doesn'’t have to suffer

06:17.768 --> 06:20.684
the indignity of getting
his ass kicked by a naked man.

06:24.601 --> 06:26.734
[chuckles]:
Yeah,

06:26.777 --> 06:28.953
Jake, your system
is perfect...Thank you.

06:28.997 --> 06:32.087
if we were trying to stop
a small lady or Larry King.

06:34.742 --> 06:36.396
Now, what if our intruder
was big and tough,

06:36.439 --> 06:37.614
like, Nightmare'’s size?

06:37.658 --> 06:39.399
You couldn'’t take
somebody down like that.

06:39.442 --> 06:42.053
[scoffs, chuckles]

06:42.097 --> 06:43.141
Of course I could.
[chuckles]

06:43.185 --> 06:45.709
Okay, then
take down Nightmare

06:45.753 --> 06:48.103
and prove to your whole family
why you don'’t need an alarm.

06:50.497 --> 06:52.673
I mean, now... it'’s awkward.
You know what I mean?

06:52.716 --> 06:54.065
I don'’t want...
I don'’t want Nightmare

06:54.109 --> 06:55.502
to feel pressured or anything.

06:57.678 --> 06:59.506
Oh, you have my full consent.

07:19.264 --> 07:20.744
You know, it'’s not fair
that he'’s expecting me.

07:20.788 --> 07:22.267
That what it i...
You know what I mean?

07:22.311 --> 07:23.486
If-if this was the real deal,

07:23.530 --> 07:24.835
I'’d have the element
of surprise.

07:24.879 --> 07:26.184
Which I don'’t have, so...

07:26.228 --> 07:28.273
Well, if anyone
actually dangerous breaks in,

07:28.317 --> 07:29.449
can'’t we just call the police?

07:29.492 --> 07:31.363
Uh, sure, except
the average response time

07:31.407 --> 07:33.409
in this neighborhood
is 23 minutes.

07:33.453 --> 07:36.717
That'’s enough time
for 400 stabs.

07:36.760 --> 07:39.502
Good lord, how fast
do people stab?

07:39.546 --> 07:41.765
Well, picture
a sewing machine on meth.

07:48.032 --> 07:49.904
Okay. I'’m sorry, Jake,

07:49.947 --> 07:51.079
but as long as Cooper'’s
living here,

07:51.122 --> 07:52.341
we need to get an alarm.

07:52.384 --> 07:54.778
No, Claire, we do not
need an alarm.

07:54.822 --> 07:56.824
Geez.

07:56.867 --> 08:00.436
Now that that'’s settled,
would anybody like a coffee?

08:00.480 --> 08:02.656
A water?
Some tea? A...

08:02.699 --> 08:04.048
surprise attack
from the back?!

08:05.354 --> 08:07.617
[laughs]

08:07.661 --> 08:08.879
Your reach don'’t work up here.
Oh...

08:09.619 --> 08:11.926
[grunts]

08:11.969 --> 08:12.970
Uh...

08:13.014 --> 08:14.406
yeah, we should get that alarm.

08:14.450 --> 08:15.190
Yeah, we should.

08:17.584 --> 08:19.716
And if you'’re still offering,
I'’d love a coffee.

08:29.291 --> 08:31.206

Stupid alarm.

08:31.249 --> 08:33.382
All right, the code is
my birthday,

08:33.425 --> 08:34.862
Claire'’s birthday
and the number of women

08:34.905 --> 08:36.037
I'’ve slept with
who aren'’t Claire.

08:36.080 --> 08:38.474
23, 17, 00.

08:40.432 --> 08:41.695
20 seconds.

08:44.698 --> 08:47.135
Man...

08:49.616 --> 08:50.617
Incorrect code.

08:50.660 --> 08:51.574

09:03.891 --> 09:05.675
You... piece of crap.

09:05.719 --> 09:06.763
It'’s fun, huh?

09:06.807 --> 09:08.199
Aah!

09:08.243 --> 09:09.984
No. I hate it, Claire.

09:10.027 --> 09:11.638
I feel like a prisoner here.

09:11.681 --> 09:13.509
Aw, you'’re just too focused
on all the negatives

09:13.553 --> 09:15.598
and you'’re ignoring
all the perks. Like...

09:15.642 --> 09:18.383
does my handsome little
number cruncher know

09:18.427 --> 09:20.385
that this system keeps data

09:20.429 --> 09:23.171
of everything that
happens in our home?

09:23.214 --> 09:25.869
Daddy does love data.[chuckles]

09:25.913 --> 09:28.002
And it tells you stuff like

09:28.045 --> 09:29.438
how many people
come in and out.

09:29.481 --> 09:31.353
Where we spend
most of our time.

09:31.396 --> 09:35.009
You could make a graph.[chuckles]

09:35.052 --> 09:36.576
I love graphs.

09:36.619 --> 09:38.055

Backyard motion detected.

09:40.405 --> 09:42.277
Ooh, how did it know
what I was thinking?

09:42.320 --> 09:43.365
[chuckles]

09:43.408 --> 09:45.106
Oh, the backyard.

09:45.149 --> 09:46.324
Actual yard.Yeah, it'’s...

09:46.368 --> 09:48.370
Actual backyard.Oh, this is the best part.

09:48.413 --> 09:49.937
It'’s my parents.

09:49.980 --> 09:52.461
Probably coming over again
to steal more stuff.

09:52.504 --> 09:54.245
Those dirty mother...

09:54.289 --> 09:56.813
and father of my wife.

Claire, honey, are you in there?

09:59.207 --> 10:02.036
Claire? Honey, why'’s this door
locked? Let us in.[knocks]

10:02.079 --> 10:03.907
Hey, Mom, what are
you guys doing here?

10:03.951 --> 10:06.693
Don'’t say to steal stuff.
Just be cool.

10:06.736 --> 10:10.305
Uh, we were just
stopping by to steal stuff.

10:10.348 --> 10:13.047
Damn it, Gerald,
you put it in my head.

10:13.090 --> 10:13.917
You ready to feel alive?

10:13.961 --> 10:14.962
Absolutely.

10:21.185 --> 10:23.057
Wait, what the hell is going on?

10:23.100 --> 10:26.277
I'’m putting the law
back in son-in-law!

10:26.321 --> 10:28.584
[barking]Gerald, they got dogs!

10:28.628 --> 10:29.933
Run!

10:31.065 --> 10:33.284
[laughing]

10:33.328 --> 10:35.286
Hit '’em with
the sprinklers, babe.

10:35.330 --> 10:36.592
Oh, Jake, I think
they'’ve had enough.

10:36.636 --> 10:38.420
No. Hit them
with the sprinklers.

10:46.080 --> 10:47.734
[alarm wailing]

10:50.084 --> 10:51.433
[alarm stops]

10:51.476 --> 10:53.174
Hey, babe, I'’m home.

10:53.217 --> 10:54.218
JAKE:
Hello, Clarice.

10:57.874 --> 10:59.746
Ooh, you look like a sexy piano.

10:59.789 --> 11:01.356
[laughs]

11:01.399 --> 11:04.533
Why don'’t you come over here
and, uh, Bach that ass up?

11:07.492 --> 11:09.451
How are you seeing me right now?

11:09.494 --> 11:11.714
[giggles]

11:11.758 --> 11:13.455
Oh, my God, you look like

11:13.498 --> 11:15.892
the world'’s saddest casino boss.

11:17.372 --> 11:18.765
Baby, baby, baby, no, no,

11:18.808 --> 11:20.070
wait, wait, wait,
wait, right there,

11:20.114 --> 11:21.158
don'’t move.
Stand right there.

11:21.202 --> 11:22.943
Enhance.

11:22.986 --> 11:25.423
Enhance.

11:25.467 --> 11:26.990
Enhance.Wait, are you using a camera

11:27.034 --> 11:28.731
to zoom in on my butt?

11:28.775 --> 11:32.169
Mm, and...

11:32.213 --> 11:34.955
capture.
[chuckles]

11:34.998 --> 11:37.522
Oh, come on, Jake.
[scoffs]

11:37.566 --> 11:39.829
I can do way better than that.

11:39.873 --> 11:43.354
CLAIRE: [grunts] Yes!JAKE:
Yes, yes! Ooh, give it to me.

11:43.398 --> 11:46.401
Yes! Cheeks
are involved.

11:46.444 --> 11:47.228
Capture, capture.

11:49.709 --> 11:53.060
Oh, babe, you were right,
I-I have to admit, this is, uh,

11:53.103 --> 11:55.889
this is amazing stuff.
This system'’s great. Look,

11:55.932 --> 11:57.325
there'’s no trespassers
out back,

11:57.368 --> 11:58.761
no sign of your parents

11:58.805 --> 12:00.371
near our Costco supplies,

12:00.415 --> 12:02.199
and best of all,

12:02.243 --> 12:05.942
our little pop star
is in his room, safe and sound.Mm.

12:05.986 --> 12:07.814
Being closely monitored
by his accountant,

12:07.857 --> 12:09.903
that he lives with.[chuckles]

12:09.946 --> 12:12.166
Just as it should be.Mm-hmm.

12:12.209 --> 12:14.559
You know, I just feel so
powerful with this system.

12:14.603 --> 12:17.040
I'’ve been solving all kinds
of mysteries with this thing.

12:17.084 --> 12:18.650
Like, you know we were
wondering why the dishwasher

12:18.694 --> 12:20.522
wasn'’t cleaning
our silverware?

12:20.565 --> 12:22.611
Well, yeah, I already solved
that one, it'’s because it sucks,

12:22.654 --> 12:23.960
and we should
replace it.

12:24.004 --> 12:26.354
Oh, yes.

12:26.397 --> 12:28.748
We should replace it.
You'’re probably right, Claire.

12:28.791 --> 12:30.750
Case closed.
[chuckles]

12:30.793 --> 12:33.578
There is, however,
one more thing.

12:35.580 --> 12:38.583
Uh, Cooper, can you join us
in the kitchen, please?

12:38.627 --> 12:39.802
Can you just tell me what...I'’m sorry,

12:39.846 --> 12:41.499
I can'’t comment
on the investigation

12:41.543 --> 12:43.850
until Cooper walks in and says,
"Hiya, guys. What'’s happening?"

12:43.893 --> 12:45.808
Hiya, guys.
What'’s happening?

12:45.852 --> 12:48.202
Cooper,

12:48.245 --> 12:51.074
you enjoy making peanut butter
sandwiches, don'’t you?

12:51.118 --> 12:53.598
Yeah, yeah,
I love to cook.

12:53.642 --> 12:54.904
Mm, mm.

12:54.948 --> 12:57.646
And, when you'’re
done cooking,

12:57.689 --> 13:00.127
what do you normally do
with said knife?

13:00.170 --> 13:02.738
Well, I-I rinse it and put it
in the dishwasher.

13:02.782 --> 13:04.696
Ah, rinse it...

13:04.740 --> 13:07.482
and put it in the dishwasher.

13:07.525 --> 13:09.266
I guess the case
is closed, Claire.

13:09.310 --> 13:10.833
You were right.

13:10.877 --> 13:12.661
We just need a new
dishwasher. [chuckles]

13:12.704 --> 13:15.490
There is, however,
one more thing.

13:16.491 --> 13:19.450
I submit to you,
exhibit A.

13:19.494 --> 13:22.584
[Australian accent]:
Hello. I'’m famous,

13:22.627 --> 13:24.629
and I need to eat
my sandwich right now.

13:27.545 --> 13:29.112
No time to rinse,

13:29.156 --> 13:32.246
just gonna put this dirty knife
directly into the dishwasher.

13:35.815 --> 13:38.774
You know it'’s offensive
when you do the accent.

13:41.385 --> 13:42.647
JAKE:
Uh,

13:42.691 --> 13:44.301
no, it isn'’t.

13:44.345 --> 13:45.999
What if I was Asian?

13:46.042 --> 13:48.088
Oh.

13:49.916 --> 13:52.875
The point is
an innocent appliance

13:52.919 --> 13:54.224
has been framed.

13:54.268 --> 13:57.097
What do you have to say
for yourself, young man?

13:57.140 --> 13:58.881
I guess I'’ll start
rinsing my knives.

14:01.188 --> 14:02.842
Mm-hmm.Mm-hmm.
Now, if you don'’t mind,

14:02.885 --> 14:04.147
I'’m gonna call Bono back
and keep

14:04.191 --> 14:05.670
organizing this
Syrian fundraiser.

14:08.804 --> 14:11.024
Jake, what is going on here?

14:11.067 --> 14:13.374
Well, since you guys
don'’t think I can protect us

14:13.417 --> 14:15.376
from the monsters
who live outside the house,

14:15.419 --> 14:19.336
I'’ve decided to focus on
the monsters who live inside.

14:19.380 --> 14:22.774
Okay. well that is not at all
why we got an alarm,

14:22.818 --> 14:24.254
but I suppose
it is nice to know

14:24.298 --> 14:25.865
that we don'’t need
to buy a new dishwasher.

14:25.908 --> 14:27.823
Yes, yes, it is.

14:27.867 --> 14:31.392
And while our dishes
may not be clean,

14:31.435 --> 14:33.176
you certainly should be.

14:33.220 --> 14:35.265
Um, what'’s that
supposed to mean?

14:35.309 --> 14:37.789
Mm, exhibit W,

14:37.833 --> 14:40.227
for "water waster."

14:40.270 --> 14:43.012
CLAIRE:
What? That is just a video
of the closed bathroom door.

14:43.056 --> 14:45.232
So you admit it?!
You admit it.

14:45.275 --> 14:47.887
You see, see, you got in the
shower at 4:42, but then look--

14:47.930 --> 14:49.627
enhance, enhance--

14:49.671 --> 14:51.455
those are your feet,
right here, look.

14:51.499 --> 14:55.198
At 4:45, 4:48, and 4:53.

14:55.242 --> 14:57.635
Still not in the shower.
Claire,

14:57.679 --> 15:01.683
what were you doing?

15:01.726 --> 15:04.077
You want to know
what I was doing?

15:04.120 --> 15:05.382
Oh, yes.

15:05.426 --> 15:07.080
Me and all the fish
currently dying

15:07.123 --> 15:08.255
in the Colorado River

15:08.298 --> 15:11.867
would love to know...

15:11.911 --> 15:13.260
what you were doing.

15:13.303 --> 15:15.175
[sighs]

15:15.218 --> 15:18.787
I was dry brushing
the dead skin cells off my body.

15:20.180 --> 15:21.398
[gags]

15:27.361 --> 15:28.536
What?

15:28.579 --> 15:30.233
Oh, come on,
Halle Berry does it.

15:30.277 --> 15:31.234
You don'’t think she's gross.

15:31.278 --> 15:33.410
I do now.

15:33.454 --> 15:36.544
Ugh. You know what,
I'’m going for a run.

15:36.587 --> 15:38.198
Oh, interesting.

15:38.241 --> 15:41.070
Another, uh, three-miler,
like yesterday?

15:41.114 --> 15:43.246
Yeah, I'’ll probably
just do my usual loop.

15:43.290 --> 15:44.639
[high-pitched]:
Huh.

15:46.510 --> 15:48.469
Your usual loop, she says.

15:48.512 --> 15:50.732
Usual loop.

15:52.647 --> 15:55.693
That'’s funny, because,
according to the porch camera,

15:55.737 --> 15:57.652
it'’s just you stretching
for a minute,

15:57.695 --> 16:00.437
and then 19 minutes
of you sitting on the porch

16:00.481 --> 16:02.004
scrolling through Instagram,

16:02.048 --> 16:03.832
while your dead cells
fall off your body.

16:05.573 --> 16:07.488
[gags]

16:10.143 --> 16:12.101
What the hell?
We did not get this alarm system

16:12.145 --> 16:14.451
so that you could
watch and judge our every move.

16:14.495 --> 16:16.018
We got it so we could
protect Cooper.

16:16.062 --> 16:17.628
I am protecting Cooper

16:17.672 --> 16:19.979
from living in a house of lies!

16:23.286 --> 16:24.461
Can you see me
on the monitor?

16:24.505 --> 16:25.810
You know I can.

16:25.854 --> 16:27.421
Good.
Then you can see this.

16:27.464 --> 16:29.336
[gasps]

16:37.213 --> 16:39.389
[crashing]

16:39.433 --> 16:40.869
Wha... Oh.Holy crap.

16:40.912 --> 16:42.131
Jake, what was that?

16:42.175 --> 16:43.872
Uh, probably just Cooper
and his lady friend

16:43.915 --> 16:45.265
breaking another headboard.

16:45.308 --> 16:47.615
[chuckles]
Am I right?

16:51.271 --> 16:53.577
Guys, did you hear that? I think
another stalker broke in.

16:53.621 --> 16:55.318
That'’s impossible.

16:55.362 --> 16:57.712
No one can get in here
without triggering the alarm.

16:57.755 --> 17:00.889
Wait, what the hell?
None of my cameras are working.

17:00.932 --> 17:04.110
[chuckles] Hey, fun idea,
on the count of three,

17:04.153 --> 17:05.676
let'’s all admit something bad
that we'’ve done

17:05.720 --> 17:07.113
and then immediately
forgive each other.

17:07.156 --> 17:08.723
Okay?
One, two, three.

17:08.766 --> 17:11.769
I turned off the alarm.Wait, what?

17:11.813 --> 17:13.728
I was gonna say I stole
a bass line from Marvin Gaye,

17:13.771 --> 17:14.816
but yours is way worse.

17:18.080 --> 17:20.256
Claire, why would you
turn off the alarm?

17:20.300 --> 17:22.606
Because I woke up super hungry

17:22.650 --> 17:23.912
and I couldn'’t
get back to sleep,

17:23.955 --> 17:25.261
so I snuck downstairs

17:25.305 --> 17:28.960
for some night-night cookies.

17:29.004 --> 17:32.442
Okay, first of all,
that'’s adorable. Okay?

17:32.486 --> 17:34.966
And second, you don'’t have to
turn off an alarm to do that.

17:35.010 --> 17:37.056
Yes I do, otherwise you'’d
spend our entire breakfast

17:37.099 --> 17:39.232
showing me replay
of how I left crumbs

17:39.275 --> 17:41.799
all over the kitchen counter.

17:41.843 --> 17:43.671
Why can'’t you just use
your iPad to watch porn,

17:43.714 --> 17:46.456
like a regular husband?

17:46.500 --> 17:48.589
Well, if you took the
parental locks off those sites,

17:48.632 --> 17:50.156
maybe I would.

17:50.199 --> 17:52.375
Guys, please focus.
Someone is downstairs.

17:52.419 --> 17:55.335
I thought you said that your
stalkers are usually harmless.

17:55.378 --> 17:57.206
Well, day stalkers
come for underwear,

17:57.250 --> 17:59.208
but night stalkers
come for blood.

18:01.123 --> 18:03.125
And underwear.
They all like underwear.

18:03.169 --> 18:05.345
I'’m calling the police.[sighs]

18:05.388 --> 18:08.783
But Wayne said that the average
response time is 23 minutes.

18:08.826 --> 18:11.568
That means this psycho
could stab us, sit down,

18:11.612 --> 18:14.223
watch an episode of
Seinfeld,and then leave.

18:15.790 --> 18:17.574
Jake, where are you going?

18:17.618 --> 18:19.533
To protect my family.

18:24.190 --> 18:25.408
[clattering]

18:28.194 --> 18:30.631
Be right back, fight club!

18:30.674 --> 18:34.374
Gonna get my black belt
of karate out of the dryer.

18:34.417 --> 18:36.202
I know I'’m supposed
to air dry it,

18:36.245 --> 18:37.855
but I don'’t follow the rules,
'’cause I'm crazy!

18:37.899 --> 18:38.769
'’Cause I'm crazy.

18:40.467 --> 18:41.990
Ooh...

18:42.033 --> 18:43.774
[whispering]:
There'’s really someone here.

18:43.818 --> 18:46.342
[whimpering]

18:46.386 --> 18:47.691
Element of surprise!

18:47.735 --> 18:50.085
Aah!

18:50.129 --> 18:51.826
I'’m your new backpack now,

18:51.869 --> 18:53.262
and I'’m full of no good.

18:53.306 --> 18:55.264
[grunts]

18:55.308 --> 18:56.570
Jake, are you okay?

18:56.613 --> 18:58.702
COOPER:
Wh... Nightmare?

18:58.746 --> 19:00.313
What the hell
are you doing here?

19:00.356 --> 19:03.229
Wayne had asked me
to guard your house.

19:03.272 --> 19:05.144
And what? Y-You got
hungry, or...

19:05.187 --> 19:08.669
No, I saw another
freaky lady in your kitchen.

19:08.712 --> 19:10.410
She was hunched over your sink,

19:10.453 --> 19:12.542
just devouring food,

19:12.586 --> 19:14.805
like that bear
from The Revenant.

19:14.849 --> 19:16.894
I don'’t mean
to scare you,

19:16.938 --> 19:18.374
but I think
she may still be in here.

19:18.418 --> 19:20.115
Oh, she'’s in here,
all right.

19:23.162 --> 19:25.947
I'’m sorry I turned off
the alarm, okay?

19:25.990 --> 19:27.427
But there are certain things
that I just

19:27.470 --> 19:29.907
don'’t want you to know about,
like when I eat cookies,

19:29.951 --> 19:31.735
or how much time
I spend in the bathroom.

19:31.779 --> 19:33.520
Well, this week you averaged...Do not finish that sentence.

19:33.563 --> 19:34.651
Yup.

19:34.695 --> 19:35.783
Look, we'’ve been together

19:35.826 --> 19:37.088
for over a decade,

19:37.132 --> 19:39.134
but I still need some
mystery in our lives.

19:39.178 --> 19:40.962
I mean, I hate the feeling
of being watched

19:41.005 --> 19:42.877
every moment of my life.Tell me about it.

19:42.920 --> 19:44.966
One of the reasons
I'’ve loved living with you guys

19:45.009 --> 19:47.055
is that I get a break
from the outside world.

19:47.098 --> 19:49.492
Out there, everyone treats me
like a panda at the zoo,

19:49.536 --> 19:52.930
always taking photos and way too
curious about when I have sex.

19:52.974 --> 19:55.194
Okay, all right,

19:55.237 --> 19:57.718
maybe I got a little
carried away with the cameras,

19:57.761 --> 19:59.328
and the sensors, and the...

19:59.372 --> 20:00.938
that true crime
cooking show I made up,

20:00.982 --> 20:02.462
Making a Burgerer,

20:02.505 --> 20:04.246
but we need this system
to protect you.

20:04.290 --> 20:05.987
Do we?

20:06.030 --> 20:07.075
I mean, look at
what you just did--

20:07.118 --> 20:09.251
you protected us
from a man whose...

20:09.295 --> 20:12.123
legal name is
Nightmare Big Man.

20:12.167 --> 20:14.996
Actually, it'’s pronounced
"Nit-mari Bigmin."

20:17.128 --> 20:19.566
Really? Oh, my God,
I'’m so sorry.

20:19.609 --> 20:21.350
Well, to be fair,

20:21.394 --> 20:23.787
all I did was tackle him
and whisper a badass line

20:23.831 --> 20:25.049
about being a backpack.

20:25.093 --> 20:27.008
Yeah, if I
hadn'’t busted my ankle

20:27.051 --> 20:28.749
on that stupid vacuum
by the door,

20:28.792 --> 20:31.447
I would have pushed your
brains out your ears.

20:31.491 --> 20:33.536
Good heavens, Nit-mari.

20:33.580 --> 20:35.364
CLAIRE:
Did you hear that?

20:35.408 --> 20:37.279
Your vacuum system worked.

20:37.323 --> 20:39.150
Maybe we canget
rid of the alarm.

20:39.194 --> 20:40.935
Now, honestly,
I would love that.

20:40.978 --> 20:43.459
Yeah. Maybe you'’re right.

20:43.503 --> 20:44.721
You know, uh...

20:44.765 --> 20:47.202
turns out all the security
we need is, uh,

20:47.246 --> 20:50.249
just me, a vacuum
and, uh... [chuckles]

20:50.292 --> 20:52.512
the element
of surprise! Ha-ha!

20:52.555 --> 20:53.817
Aah! Ho-ho!

20:57.081 --> 20:58.996
Ooh. Night-night cookies.
