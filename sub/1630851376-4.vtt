00:01.344 --> 00:02.687
- Chapter 11.

00:02.787 --> 00:04.009
In between work
and raising kids,

00:05.109 --> 00:06.312
the Hayworths didn't have
much time to get out

00:06.392 --> 00:08.055
and enjoy the finer things.

00:08.155 --> 00:10.700
It's bold, it's playful,
a clear rejection

00:10.800 --> 00:13.064
of the modern realist
aesthetic.

00:13.164 --> 00:15.268
- Note the use
of color and movement.

00:15.368 --> 00:17.312
It really captures
the idea of...

00:17.412 --> 00:19.596
being a cat on a spaceship.

00:19.696 --> 00:21.439
- So they settled
for a student art show

00:21.539 --> 00:22.642
at the fancy private school

00:22.742 --> 00:24.325
where Connor
sent his daughter.

00:24.425 --> 00:26.288
- This is the most brazen
display of privilege

00:26.388 --> 00:28.392
that I've ever seen.

00:29.474 --> 00:31.297
But definitely the best wine
I've ever had in my life.

00:31.397 --> 00:32.739
- I know, right?

00:32.840 --> 00:34.223
I wonder if I have a ziplock
in my bag.

00:34.323 --> 00:35.505
- I mean, it ought to be.

00:35.605 --> 00:36.707
This place costs
40 grand a year.

00:36.807 --> 00:38.310
- $40,000?

00:38.410 --> 00:40.113
That's like the cost of one
of those new hybrid minivans

00:40.213 --> 00:42.638
with parking sensors.

00:42.738 --> 00:44.521
Sorry, it's, like,
my dream car.

00:44.621 --> 00:46.886
- So in a city
that apparently can't afford

00:46.986 --> 00:48.689
counseling jobs like mine,

00:48.789 --> 00:50.332
some parent just coughed up

00:50.432 --> 00:52.828
$600 for a rainbow horsey?

00:52.838 --> 00:54.261
- This place is amazing, right?
- Oh, amazing.

00:54.361 --> 00:55.543
- We were just saying that.

00:55.643 --> 00:56.485
- Yeah, it's not
at all ridiculous.

00:56.565 --> 00:57.787
- I see you guys are admiring

00:57.887 --> 00:59.751
Gretchen's "Rainbow Horsey."

01:00.851 --> 01:03.516
But you're too late, this
bad boy is riding home with me.

01:03.616 --> 01:05.680
- You paid 600 bucks
for your own daughter's art?

01:05.780 --> 01:06.922
- $1,200, yeah.

01:07.022 --> 01:08.806
Part of a set
with "Sparkle Horsey."

01:08.906 --> 01:10.929
- Mm.
- Oh, guys, this is Allison.

01:11.029 --> 01:13.574
She's our headmaster,
and she's the best.

01:13.674 --> 01:15.203
- It's so nice seeing
all of our Windmount families

01:15.213 --> 01:16.822
raising money
for our planetarium.

01:16.922 --> 01:18.826
- I'm surprised that you
don't already have one.

01:18.926 --> 01:21.751
- We do, actually,
but it still includes Pluto,

01:21.851 --> 01:23.394
so it's basically garbage.

01:24.494 --> 01:25.596
- Wow.

01:25.696 --> 01:27.640
- Oh!

01:27.740 --> 01:30.405
Camila.

01:30.505 --> 01:32.509
Look who it is.

01:34.953 --> 01:37.618
Frida Kahlo.
We've talked about her.

01:37.718 --> 01:39.140
She's on those socks
I gave you.

01:39.241 --> 01:41.384
- Oh, yeah, eyebrow lady.

01:41.485 --> 01:45.032
- Actually, Frida was more than
an eyebrow lady and sock model.

01:45.132 --> 01:47.195
She employed
a naive folk art style--

01:47.295 --> 01:50.001
- Thanks, but we know
who Frida is.

01:50.101 --> 01:51.283
We're Mexican American.

01:51.383 --> 01:53.006
She's like
our Bruce Springsteen.

01:53.106 --> 01:55.250
- How wonderful. Hailey!

01:55.350 --> 01:57.815
Hailey here is in
our Spanish immersion program.

01:57.914 --> 01:59.378
- Ah.
- Isn't that right, Hailey?

01:59.478 --> 02:00.700
- I guess.
- Yeah.

02:00.800 --> 02:03.145
This little girl
speaks Spanish too.

02:03.245 --> 02:07.512

02:09.336 --> 02:11.279
Camila, say something.

Ooh, Thor!

02:16.629 --> 02:17.851
Oh!

02:17.951 --> 02:19.735
- Sorry, I just assumed
she spoke Spanish.

02:19.835 --> 02:22.179
- No, she does.
- Oh, of course.

02:22.279 --> 02:24.744
- No, really, she knows a lot
about Mexican culture.

02:24.844 --> 02:27.148
- Oh, this has, like,
everyone from Asgard.

02:27.248 --> 02:30.875
There's Odin, Sif,
Fandral, Volstagg.

02:30.975 --> 02:33.360
- Someone's pronunciation
is really coming along.

02:33.460 --> 02:35.684
- She knows a lot
about a lot of cultures.

02:45.841 --> 02:47.865
I just wish Mrs. Adams
were here to see this.

02:47.966 --> 02:49.349
- Hmm?
- She was the old

02:49.449 --> 02:51.152
school counselor
until a few months ago.

02:51.252 --> 02:52.795
- Oh, I'm so sorry.

02:52.895 --> 02:55.199
- Oh, no, she didn't die.
She just snapped.

02:55.299 --> 02:57.764
Yeah, big-time.
Full-blown bananas.

02:57.864 --> 03:01.010
- We prefer to say she suffered
from mental exhaustion.

03:01.110 --> 03:03.575

you're looking for someone?

Because Sarah
is an amazing counselor.

She's always giving
unsolicited advice.

03:08.563 --> 03:09.826
She does it to me all the time.

03:09.926 --> 03:11.950
- Well, we're considering
candidates now.

03:12.050 --> 03:13.833
I'd be happy
to look over your CV.

03:13.933 --> 03:15.396

Right, Sarah?

03:15.496 --> 03:17.280
- Oh, uh...

03:17.380 --> 03:19.203
I'm just not sure that this
is what I'm looking for.

03:19.303 --> 03:22.289
- Well, if it is,
Connor knows where to find me.

03:22.389 --> 03:25.014
Bryce, don't touch
the Play-Doh Venus de Milo.

03:25.114 --> 03:27.298
Excuse me.

03:27.398 --> 03:28.700
- Uh, what was that?

03:28.800 --> 03:29.862
- It sounded interesting.

03:29.962 --> 03:31.305
I mean, I'm even tempted.

03:31.405 --> 03:32.934
My school doesn't even have
chalkboard erasers.

03:32.944 --> 03:34.192
- Wait, seriously?
How do you, like--

03:34.292 --> 03:36.416
- We don't have chalk either,
so...doesn't really matter.

03:37.978 --> 03:39.963
- Do you really think that
I would be a good fit here?

03:40.063 --> 03:42.748
I mean, there's a hand turkey
over there for $800.

03:43.990 --> 03:45.372

Couple Thanksgivings,
that thing pays for itself.

Not so fast.

- Okay.

03:55.170 --> 03:56.393
- Can you believe it?

03:56.493 --> 03:58.837
Camila didn't recognize
Frida Kahlo,

03:58.937 --> 03:59.918
and then she couldn't keep up

04:00.019 --> 04:01.322
with that white girl
in Spanish.

04:01.422 --> 04:02.924
She's totally lost touch
with her culture.

any better, it's not like

04:04.467 --> 04:05.930
she's that plugged in
to my culture either.

04:06.030 --> 04:07.373
- What is your culture?

04:07.473 --> 04:09.256
- Scottish? Irish?

04:09.356 --> 04:11.099
It's definitely an "ish."

04:11.199 --> 04:12.342
Although there's
an old family story

04:12.442 --> 04:14.906
that we're 1/64 Cherokee.
- Yeah.

04:15.005 --> 04:16.750
Your dad needs to stop
bringing that up.

04:16.850 --> 04:19.394
- Oh, yeah, Thanksgiving is...
so embarrassing.

04:19.494 --> 04:21.558
- You know, Camila had
to choose a country

04:21.658 --> 04:24.884
for her school's world festival
and she chose Canada.

04:24.984 --> 04:26.688

Wolverine's from.

- Hey, that's right, sweetie.
That's right!

04:29.112 --> 04:32.017
But yeah, no, maybe you
want to focus on Mexico?

04:32.117 --> 04:34.582
You have a personal
connection there.

on to Camila,

- Right.

to care about "Star Trek."

05:20.365 --> 05:22.870

- Which--wow, okay.

07:58.894 --> 08:00.637
- I know it looks ridiculous.

08:00.737 --> 08:02.521
- It does.

08:02.621 --> 08:03.963
- But we are trying
to help Camila

08:04.063 --> 08:06.889
stay connected
to her Mexican roots, so...

08:06.989 --> 08:08.411
- In this family?

08:08.511 --> 08:10.094
Good luck.

08:10.194 --> 08:11.577
- What does that mean?

08:11.677 --> 08:13.581
- It's like trying to find
your car in a snowstorm.

08:13.681 --> 08:15.264
There's just so much white.

08:15.364 --> 08:16.666
[chuckles]

08:16.766 --> 08:18.069
[echoing eerily]
White.

08:18.169 --> 08:19.552
- You want to get
on the ball, right,

08:19.652 --> 08:22.998
and you want to give it
a little wag, wag, wag.

08:23.098 --> 08:25.523
- There must be
a higher SPF than 100.

08:25.623 --> 08:27.446
- [distorted laughter]

08:27.546 --> 08:28.568
both: ♪ One, two ♪

08:28.668 --> 08:30.532
♪ Princes kneel before you ♪

08:30.632 --> 08:31.972
♪ That's what I said now ♪

08:32.074 --> 08:35.821
[both vocalizing]

08:35.921 --> 08:37.504
- Denise.
- Yes?

08:37.604 --> 08:39.949
- Have you ever thought about
how white this family is?

08:40.049 --> 08:41.752
- Oh, I've never stopped
thinking about it.

08:41.852 --> 08:43.876
- They're eating macaroni salad
out of a bread bowl.

08:43.976 --> 08:46.441
- Careful, guys,
it's a little spicy.

08:46.540 --> 08:47.763
- Oh, my God.

08:47.863 --> 08:50.207
I brought the macaroni salad.

08:50.307 --> 08:52.492
The white is coming
from inside the house!

08:52.592 --> 08:54.535
Everybody! Escuchenme!

08:54.635 --> 08:56.619
Next weekend,
I am going to host

08:56.719 --> 08:58.903
a traditional Mexican dinner.

08:59.003 --> 09:00.506
Okay, vas a una fiesta!

09:00.606 --> 09:02.269
- Yeah.

09:02.369 --> 09:04.513
- Hooray, a theme night!

09:04.613 --> 09:06.076
- Not a theme night.

09:06.176 --> 09:08.000
It is my heritage
and my children's heritage.

09:08.100 --> 09:11.406
So I will be making my family's

09:11.506 --> 09:12.889
traditional three-day mole.

09:12.989 --> 09:14.171
- Mmm.

09:14.271 --> 09:16.455
- Whoo!
- Yeah!

09:16.555 --> 09:18.579
- Hey, so did Marina
suddenly get, like,

09:18.679 --> 09:20.022
good at cooking or something?

09:20.122 --> 09:22.186
- No, that's why we brought
the macaroni salad.

09:22.286 --> 09:24.470
We're excited, honey!
Looking forward to it!

09:24.570 --> 09:26.774
This could be no bueno.

09:29.699 --> 09:32.605
[light music]

09:32.705 --> 09:34.729
- Hey!

09:34.829 --> 09:36.452
You got the interview
all by yourself.

09:36.552 --> 09:38.135
- I did, yes.

09:38.235 --> 09:40.259
I guess you should've
trusted me.

09:40.359 --> 09:41.861
Wait, what are you doing here?

09:41.961 --> 09:44.346
- Oh, um...

09:44.446 --> 09:46.270
just dropping off Gretchen.

09:46.370 --> 09:47.632
- It's 1:00 in the afternoon.

09:47.732 --> 09:49.155
- Yeah, right.
Picking up Gretchen.

09:49.255 --> 09:50.758
- It's 1:00 in the afternoon.
- Okay, fine.

09:50.858 --> 09:53.563
I got here early
to wish you luck.

09:53.663 --> 09:56.127
Not that you'll need it.
Wink, wink.

09:56.227 --> 09:57.931
- Connor, what's going on?
- Nothing.

09:58.031 --> 09:59.894
Just got a real good feeling
about this, wink, wink.

09:59.994 --> 10:01.137
- Okay, stop saying
"wink, wink."

10:01.237 --> 10:02.699
What did you do?
Did you pull those strings?

10:02.799 --> 10:03.862
- No, you told me
not to do that,

10:03.962 --> 10:05.264
and I respected that.

10:05.364 --> 10:06.386
- Okay, good.

10:06.486 --> 10:07.909
- But after
you got the interview,

10:08.009 --> 10:09.131
I remembered about
that sculpture garden

10:09.211 --> 10:10.634
I'd been meaning to donate,
and I donated it.

10:10.734 --> 10:13.679
- Connor!
- Just greasing the wheel.

10:13.779 --> 10:15.082
- That's the problem,
the grease.

10:15.182 --> 10:16.725
It's as bad as the strings.

10:16.825 --> 10:18.047
Now the whole interview
is rigged!

10:18.147 --> 10:20.251
- Right? Now you can relax

10:20.351 --> 10:21.814
knowing it's a lock.

10:21.914 --> 10:23.417
They're probably not even
interviewing anyone else.

10:23.517 --> 10:25.781
- Sarah,
Allison is ready for you.

10:25.881 --> 10:27.885
- Oh, thank you.

10:28.606 --> 10:30.951
A lock, huh?

10:31.051 --> 10:33.756
So I guess there's
nothing that I could say

10:33.856 --> 10:35.679
that would blow my chances.

10:35.779 --> 10:37.162
- I don't know
where this is going.

10:37.262 --> 10:38.725
- Like telling her
what I really think

10:38.825 --> 10:40.288
of this
ridiculously entitled school

10:40.388 --> 10:41.730
and everyone in it.

10:41.830 --> 10:43.694
- Sarah,
are you seriously saying

10:43.794 --> 10:44.836
that you're gonna
tank this interview

10:44.915 --> 10:46.058
just 'cause you're mad at me?

10:46.158 --> 10:48.543
- No, I guess I wouldn't.

10:48.643 --> 10:51.208
Wink, wink.
- Sarah, come on.

10:53.372 --> 10:55.535
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm!

10:57.499 --> 10:59.763
Ah, of course
you have squash courts.

10:59.863 --> 11:02.248
- That's racquetball,
but we have both.

11:02.348 --> 11:05.454
I have to say,
this is an impressive CV.

11:05.554 --> 11:07.057
- And you're sure that the CV

11:07.157 --> 11:08.860
is the only reason
why I'm here?

11:08.960 --> 11:11.264
- Not the only reason.
Your references obviously help.

11:11.364 --> 11:12.987
- Right, sure,
good old Benjamin Franklin

11:13.087 --> 11:14.430
can be quite persuasive.

11:14.530 --> 11:16.153
- He did publish
"The Pennsylvania Gazette"

11:16.253 --> 11:18.157
at only 23 years old.

11:18.257 --> 11:19.439
I mean...
- I mean!

11:19.539 --> 11:20.641
- Right?
- [laughs]

11:20.741 --> 11:22.645
Allison, how do you
sleep at night?

11:22.745 --> 11:24.248
- On my side
with a night guard.

11:24.348 --> 11:26.612
I'm a grinder.
Why do you ask?

11:26.712 --> 11:29.017
- Just 'cause it would keep me
up at night if I took money

11:29.117 --> 11:30.419
that could go
to underfunded schools

11:30.519 --> 11:33.625
and instead spent it
on shiny toys for the rich,

11:33.725 --> 11:35.629
like a butterfly atrium,

11:35.729 --> 11:38.233
a rock-climbing wall,
an espresso bar.

11:38.333 --> 11:39.796
- It's a juice bar.

11:39.896 --> 11:41.880
They're children.

11:41.980 --> 11:43.804
Sarah, did I offend you
somehow?

11:43.904 --> 11:45.847
- Yes, when you took a bribe
from my brother.

11:45.947 --> 11:47.851
- What?
- I want a job,

11:47.951 --> 11:50.295
but I don't want a job
that can be bought.

11:50.395 --> 11:52.139
You may have your precious
sculpture garden,

11:52.239 --> 11:53.702
but I have my integrity.

11:53.802 --> 11:56.106
So I think you're gonna have
to find another candidate.

11:56.206 --> 11:57.629
[knock at door]
- Excuse me, Allison.

11:57.729 --> 12:00.113
I wanted to let you know the
next candidate is running late.

12:00.213 --> 12:02.197
- Thank you.

12:02.297 --> 12:03.479
- There are other candidates?

12:03.579 --> 12:05.363
- Of course.
That's how job interviews work.

12:05.463 --> 12:07.006
- But my brother
bought a sculpture garden.

12:07.106 --> 12:07.947
- Yes, and I told him
that would not

12:08.027 --> 12:09.370
influence my decision.

12:09.470 --> 12:11.454
And then he said,
"I totally get it, wink, wink,"

12:11.554 --> 12:13.498
which was weird.
- Oh, my God.

12:13.598 --> 12:15.461
- I'm not some sellout, Sarah.

12:15.561 --> 12:17.986
I also have integrity.

12:18.086 --> 12:20.029
And not that it matters,
but by Windmount standards,

12:20.129 --> 12:21.873
your brother is a small fish.

12:21.973 --> 12:24.478
The founders of Pinterest
send their kids here,

12:24.578 --> 12:26.561
Aiden and Constance Pinterest,
great kids.

12:26.661 --> 12:29.166
- So clearly,
I jumped to some conclusions.

12:29.266 --> 12:31.851
So, uh, you did mention
a juice bar.

12:31.951 --> 12:33.815
Is that only open to students?

12:33.915 --> 12:35.918
- You should go.
- I should go.

12:39.445 --> 12:41.588
- [sniffles]
- Cómo estás?

12:41.689 --> 12:44.354
Porque tú...

12:44.454 --> 12:45.636
- [sniffles]

12:45.736 --> 12:47.439
- Crying?
- I'm not crying.

12:47.539 --> 12:49.283
I was grinding chilies,
and then I touched my eyes,

12:49.383 --> 12:51.807
and now I can't read
my abuela's recipe.

12:51.907 --> 12:53.170
- Oh, I'll read it to you.
- It's no help.

12:53.270 --> 12:54.532
There are no real measurements.

12:54.632 --> 12:57.017
How much cumin
is a "whisper" of cumin?

12:57.117 --> 12:58.580
How much chicken
is a "handful"?

12:58.680 --> 13:00.263
- Honey, it's gonna be okay.

13:00.363 --> 13:02.266
- How?
I was supposed to give Camila

13:02.366 --> 13:04.110
one authentic
Mexican experience,

13:04.210 --> 13:05.592
but the only decorations
I could find

13:05.692 --> 13:07.877
are a novelty sombrero
from my bachelorette party

13:07.977 --> 13:10.882
and a "People" magazine
with Salma Hayek on the cover.

13:10.982 --> 13:12.405
- She was so good
in "Fools Rush In."

13:12.505 --> 13:14.368
- Okay.

13:14.468 --> 13:17.334
And this three-day mole
has taken me five days,

13:17.434 --> 13:20.099
and honestly,
I could use another day or two.

13:20.199 --> 13:23.345
So, honey, tell me,
how's this gonna be okay?

13:23.445 --> 13:25.469
- Well, I was just working
on a book with Sofía,

13:25.569 --> 13:27.873
and look,
she made us pasteles!

13:27.973 --> 13:29.997
- Damn it.
Is that what I smell?

13:30.097 --> 13:32.040
I thought I was doing so good.

13:32.141 --> 13:34.445
- Honey, let's just tell
everyone that you made it.

13:34.545 --> 13:36.008
I mean,
I'm ghostwriting for her.

13:36.108 --> 13:38.693
She might as well
ghost-cook for us.

13:38.793 --> 13:40.616
- No, no,
pasteles are Puerto Rican!

13:40.716 --> 13:41.899
This whole night
is about giving Camila

13:41.999 --> 13:43.902
something that's Mexican.

13:44.002 --> 13:47.308
- Hola, madame et monsieur.

13:47.408 --> 13:49.272
- Ooh, something
smells amazing.

13:49.372 --> 13:51.115
- Yeah, we're not having that.
- Okay.

13:51.215 --> 13:53.399
- Mom, that's quite an outfit.

13:53.499 --> 13:56.405
- I wore it as Anita
in "West Side Story"

13:56.505 --> 13:57.767
at the community playhouse.

13:57.867 --> 14:00.893
- Your performance
was caliente.

14:00.993 --> 14:02.736
- Well, it is Mexico night.

14:02.836 --> 14:06.103
- Again, not a theme night.
And Anita is Puerto Rican.

14:06.203 --> 14:08.026
Does anyone
know the difference?

14:08.126 --> 14:09.910
- Well, she is
a fictional character.

14:10.010 --> 14:11.232
- Yes, and you probably

14:11.332 --> 14:12.173
shouldn't have been
playing her.

14:12.254 --> 14:14.257
- I know,
Anita wasn't the lead.

14:15.900 --> 14:17.604
- And there are the chilies.

14:17.704 --> 14:19.046
- Shall we?

14:19.146 --> 14:21.410
- Well, Lin-Manuel
can play Hamilton.

14:21.510 --> 14:23.414
- Hey, Sarah, come on.

14:23.514 --> 14:24.536
- Hi. Hi.

14:24.636 --> 14:26.179
- So you're saying
this is my fault?

14:26.279 --> 14:28.543
- I only went off on her
because you riled me up.

14:28.643 --> 14:29.986
- Oh, this is just ridiculous.

14:30.086 --> 14:32.471
I clearly said "wink, wink."

14:32.571 --> 14:33.753
Why would I get them
a sculpture garden

14:33.853 --> 14:35.516
if they're not gonna respect
the "wink, wink"?

14:35.616 --> 14:37.640
- I like sculptures.
- Yeah, I know you do, honey.

14:37.740 --> 14:40.205
And I'm so sick of everyone
kissing up to the Pinterests.

14:40.305 --> 14:42.369
They're not that great.
- Aiden's nice.

14:42.469 --> 14:45.134
- I am so humiliated right now.

14:45.234 --> 14:46.536
I mean, maybe
it's for the best.

14:46.636 --> 14:48.299
I clearly don't belong here.

14:48.399 --> 14:51.906
- Hailey, unlock the door,
please?

14:52.006 --> 14:54.110
You need to let your nanny
take you to dressage.

14:54.210 --> 14:56.474
- Wow, that may be
the most privileged sentence

14:56.574 --> 14:57.877
I've ever heard.

14:57.977 --> 14:59.720
- I feel bad for Hailey.

14:59.820 --> 15:01.924
Her parents, like, left her.

15:02.024 --> 15:03.727
- What do you mean?

15:03.827 --> 15:04.869
- You just can't go on
a three-month ayahuasca retreat

15:04.950 --> 15:06.252
in the jungle with a kid.

15:06.352 --> 15:08.536
It's irresponsible.

15:08.636 --> 15:11.421
- Miss Allison tries to help,
but she's not great at it.

15:11.521 --> 15:13.345
- Hailey.

15:13.445 --> 15:16.350
- I've been...so focused

15:16.450 --> 15:20.358
on planetariums
and racquetball that...

15:20.458 --> 15:22.161
I completely forgot
that these kids are just kids

15:22.261 --> 15:23.924
and they need help too.

15:24.024 --> 15:25.687
- If only there was someone
smart enough to realize that

15:25.787 --> 15:28.312
and try to help
get you this job.

15:29.875 --> 15:31.939
- Okay.

15:32.039 --> 15:33.061
- Hailey, it's gonna be okay.

15:33.161 --> 15:34.784
- Uh, hi again.

15:34.884 --> 15:38.230
- Oh, great, you're back.
- Yeah, I'm sorry.

15:38.330 --> 15:41.296
I just thought maybe I could--
may I?

15:44.582 --> 15:46.585
- Be my guest.

15:47.868 --> 15:50.412
- Uh, hey, Hailey.

15:50.512 --> 15:52.136
I know that Miss Allison
said that everything's

15:52.236 --> 15:54.620
gonna be okay, but I bet
it doesn't feel like that.

15:54.720 --> 15:58.788
Sometimes
things aren't okay, and...

15:58.888 --> 16:01.212
it's okay to not be okay.

16:03.015 --> 16:05.720
I'm sure that it's really hard
having your mom and dad away,

16:05.820 --> 16:09.127
but you can talk
to your nanny or Miss Allison.
