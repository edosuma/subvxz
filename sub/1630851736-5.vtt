00:03.337 --> 00:06.089
<i>I used to go to Tsukiji a lot
when I lived in Japan.</i>

00:06.673 --> 00:11.136
From all over the world,
the best sushi‐grade stuff,

00:11.136 --> 00:13.555
the best seafood is in this market.

00:14.056 --> 00:16.683
<i>You see the amount of fish,</i>

00:17.267 --> 00:19.478
<i>it is jaw‐dropping.</i>

00:19.478 --> 00:22.439
<i>And, I was like,
"Wow, this happens every day!"</i>

00:23.190 --> 00:26.318
And then you go to the tuna auctions
and you see where the tuna's from.

00:26.318 --> 00:28.320
And you're like,
"Wow, that's really all over the world."

00:29.071 --> 00:30.531
<i>I remember thinking...</i>

00:31.365 --> 00:34.409
<i>we're headed towards
some kind of extinction event.</i>

00:36.620 --> 00:39.331
<i>So the biggest issue
for sushi in the future is</i>

00:39.331 --> 00:41.041
<i>where the fish are gonna come from?</i>

00:42.084 --> 00:43.126
<i>And can it survive?</i>

00:49.258 --> 00:51.677
<i>Sushi is becoming so popular these days,</i>

00:51.677 --> 00:54.596
<i>you can find it in grocery stores
all over America.</i>

00:54.596 --> 00:57.474
<i>Overfishing is a serious issue in our oceans</i>

00:57.474 --> 00:58.600
<i>and fish farms bring</i>

00:58.600 --> 01:01.103
<i>a host of health
and environmental hazards.</i>

01:01.687 --> 01:03.438
<i>The United Nations estimates</i>

01:03.438 --> 01:06.984
<i>85% of the world's
commercial fish populations</i>

01:06.984 --> 01:08.861
<i>are fished to the max.</i>

01:08.861 --> 01:10.279
<i>This could be the end of an era.</i>

01:10.279 --> 01:11.780
<i>Do you think that that's accurate?</i>

01:11.780 --> 01:12.739
<i>Certainly.</i>

01:23.876 --> 01:25.085
<i>Oh, you know what's a trip?</i>

01:25.586 --> 01:29.298
This is the kind of boat my grandfather‐‐
great grandfather rode in.

01:29.298 --> 01:30.883
‐ Oh, yeah?
‐ Yeah.

01:30.883 --> 01:32.634
This is where he came in probably.

01:33.302 --> 01:34.970
‐ That's crazy to think about.

01:34.970 --> 01:36.346
‐ 1925.

01:37.890 --> 01:40.058
Why does fuckin' fish
have to be up so early, man?

01:40.058 --> 01:41.643
Carpe fuckin' diem.

01:42.186 --> 01:42.978
‐ We did it.

01:45.272 --> 01:46.607
You know what's better than this?

01:47.107 --> 01:48.150
‐ Sleeping.
‐ Sleeping.

01:58.702 --> 01:59.745
Oh, we got something.

01:59.745 --> 02:00.746
Go, Ying, go!

02:00.746 --> 02:01.455
Look at it go.

02:01.955 --> 02:04.541
‐ I hope it pulls him into the water.

02:05.334 --> 02:07.127
Oh, this size!

02:07.127 --> 02:08.337
Oh‐ho‐ho‐ho!
Whoo!

02:08.337 --> 02:10.047
Yeah, <i>ikejime</i>, Chris. Brain spike.

02:10.047 --> 02:10.756
‐ <i>Ikejime.</i>

02:10.756 --> 02:12.174
‐ I know. So what would happen right now?

02:13.133 --> 02:15.260
<i>We bleed it and then put a rod...</i>

02:15.260 --> 02:16.929
<i>Through its spine.
Yeah.</i>

02:16.929 --> 02:19.056
<i>Can we spike this one?
We don't have a spike.</i>

02:19.473 --> 02:20.766
‐ Show us what you would do with this.

02:37.241 --> 02:39.660
So what's the difference
between <i>ikejime</i> fish and not?

02:39.660 --> 02:41.787
Two things. Texture and flavor.

02:48.502 --> 02:50.462
‐ You develop more flavor that way.

02:50.462 --> 02:51.922
More umami.
‐ Right.

02:52.381 --> 02:55.008
‐ It's just so interesting to think
everything in sushi,

02:55.008 --> 02:56.802
like from the moment the fish is killed,

02:57.469 --> 02:59.847
is thought about
because it's gonna become sushi.

03:00.347 --> 03:04.226
You will <i>ikejime</i> it,
slice it, age it for a week.

03:04.226 --> 03:05.352
‐ Mmm.

03:05.352 --> 03:09.273
‐ I don't think most people,
I mean, think about fish aging.

03:09.273 --> 03:12.192
‐ It's no‐‐ It's not fresh, right?
These are...

03:12.192 --> 03:15.821
‐ Wasn't that the number one thing
people think about with‐‐ with sushi?

03:15.821 --> 03:17.656
It's gotta be fresh, right?
‐ Right.

03:17.656 --> 03:21.451
‐ And that's why it's always funny to me,
whenever you hear someone saying,

03:23.078 --> 03:25.581
"Well, it's closer‐‐
This restaurant's closer to the water."

03:25.581 --> 03:26.415
Right.

03:26.415 --> 03:28.834
‐ "So you're saying you want the view?"

03:28.834 --> 03:31.920
"No, no, no, no. It's not the view.
It's‐‐ It's gonna be better. Fresher."

03:31.920 --> 03:34.548
‐ It's like saying the wine tastes better
closer to the grapes.

03:39.303 --> 03:41.430
<i>There are many lies floating around
about sushi.</i>

03:41.430 --> 03:44.099
<i>Like that a California roll contains crab</i>

03:44.099 --> 03:46.185
<i>or that it should be drowned
in soy sauce and wasabi</i>

03:46.768 --> 03:48.729
<i>or that sushi and ketchup are a bad idea.</i>

03:49.730 --> 03:50.731
<i></i>

03:51.190 --> 03:51.982
<i>freshness.</i>

03:52.399 --> 03:54.943
‐ We have put such a premium on fresh

03:55.652 --> 03:59.114
as a marketing term, as a sales pitch,

04:00.949 --> 04:05.204
but most of the fish that you eat
is, like, 99% frozen

04:05.204 --> 04:07.581
because of the safety factors,

04:07.581 --> 04:09.875
<i>to kill any parasites.</i>

04:10.918 --> 04:12.503
Absolutely nothing is fresh.

04:14.546 --> 04:16.089
<i>This may come as a surprise,</i>

04:16.089 --> 04:18.926
<i>but the spider roll they're selling
at Hudson News in LAX,</i>

04:18.926 --> 04:19.843
<i>it isn't fresh.</i>

04:20.511 --> 04:22.596
<i>So what else is Big Sushi trying to hide?</i>

04:22.596 --> 04:24.598
‐ I wanna know
who the fuck made sushi healthy.

04:25.140 --> 04:26.683
You're adding sugar to the rice.

04:26.683 --> 04:31.772
And rice itself is basically sugar
that hasn't been converted yet into sugar.

04:31.772 --> 04:32.731
Putting mayonnaise and shit...

04:32.731 --> 04:33.732
A lot of salt...

04:33.732 --> 04:34.691
Definitely not healthy.

04:35.901 --> 04:38.070
It's amazing to me,
as popular as sushi is,

04:38.070 --> 04:39.738
people still don't know anything about it.

04:41.198 --> 04:43.033
<i>Let's talk about how this all happened.</i>

04:43.033 --> 04:46.870
<i>Like most myths in America,
it all goes back to 1980s Hollywood.</i>

05:02.553 --> 05:03.637
What is happening right now?

05:03.637 --> 05:08.141
He is scooping out the tuna
with an abalone shell,

05:08.141 --> 05:10.352
traditional way of getting the tartare.

05:10.352 --> 05:12.646
So after you fillet the tuna,

05:12.646 --> 05:15.774
you wanna utilize
every scrap on it possible.

05:16.733 --> 05:19.278
‐ My grandmother treated
a chicken that way.

05:21.572 --> 05:23.282
She treated $2 chicken that way.

05:24.199 --> 05:28.036
‐ If I had a bet on the things
that would be popular
30 years ago‐‐ 20 years ago,

05:28.036 --> 05:29.663
I never ever
would've guessed sushi, right?

05:29.663 --> 05:30.330
Right.

05:30.330 --> 05:33.125
‐ No, I would've not even put,
like, a dollar to that bet.

05:33.584 --> 05:35.252
Uh, there's no way
I would've thought that.

05:35.252 --> 05:37.796
‐ I‐‐ I always go back to...

05:38.839 --> 05:43.177
Japanese food or Japanese culture
represented in‐‐ in media.

05:43.177 --> 05:44.887
I think that is one of the reasons,

05:44.887 --> 05:47.181
certainly not the only reason,
why it's so accepted.

05:47.639 --> 05:52.269
‐ I don't know when the first time you saw
something in a movie or a TV show,

05:52.269 --> 05:54.021
<i>but for me, it was</i> The Breakfast Club.

05:54.021 --> 05:54.897
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

05:55.898 --> 05:56.481
‐ What's that?

05:57.900 --> 05:58.525
‐ Sushi.

06:00.402 --> 06:01.195
‐ Sushi?

06:01.612 --> 06:03.113
He still found it gross though, right?

06:03.113 --> 06:05.949
That's the other thing
about‐‐ about depictions of sushi

06:05.949 --> 06:06.909
during this period.

06:06.909 --> 06:09.703
‐ Sushi. Raw fish. Very good.

06:10.537 --> 06:15.125
‐ Around the '80s, there was so much
Japanese influence in Hollywood.

06:15.125 --> 06:17.753
‐ Fujitsu‐san, <i>konnichiwa!</i>

06:17.753 --> 06:19.087
<i>‐ McFly...</i>

06:19.087 --> 06:22.799
‐ Sort of mirrored what probably
was happening in corporate America

06:22.799 --> 06:27.262
<i>where Japanese businessmen were buying
giant chunks of America.</i>

06:27.262 --> 06:28.680
They bought 30 Rock.

06:29.264 --> 06:31.558
I always think of that scene
in <i>Defending Your Life</i>

06:31.558 --> 06:33.393
when they're eating sushi and they're‐‐
‐ Oh, yes.

06:36.313 --> 06:36.897
‐ Hi.

06:37.648 --> 06:40.442
<i>But for all the Japanese culture
you were seeing,</i>

06:40.442 --> 06:42.486
Japanese people are serving you, right?

06:42.486 --> 06:46.156
They're agents of luxury,
but they're not actually partakers in it.

06:47.241 --> 06:49.701
<i>Just growing up,
Japanese food was higher end.</i>

06:49.701 --> 06:50.452
Yes, yes.

06:50.452 --> 06:52.204
‐ It was for the elite class.
Yeah.

06:53.038 --> 06:55.207
<i>The fact that it's everywhere,</i>

06:55.207 --> 06:58.544
I just don't know if we really understand
what the hell happened.

07:02.130 --> 07:06.552
I'm just‐‐
I cannot wrap my head around it.

07:06.552 --> 07:10.722
Raw fish... is widely consumed.

07:12.099 --> 07:14.476
<i>Evidence doesn't point
to Molly Ringwald as the mastermind</i>

07:14.476 --> 07:16.562
<i>behind sushi's rise in America.</i>

07:16.562 --> 07:17.771
<i>By the 1980s,</i>

07:17.771 --> 07:20.524
<i>sushi as a mass‐market product
had been in the works for years.</i>

07:20.941 --> 07:23.569
<i>Many organizations benefited
from the rise of sushi</i>

07:23.569 --> 07:25.696
<i>and even became
part of the myth themselves.</i>

07:26.363 --> 07:28.448
<i>In fact, here's a fun bedtime story.</i>

07:29.992 --> 07:32.578
<i>This gentleman is Mr. Sun Myung Moon</i>

07:32.578 --> 07:34.454
<i>who is traveling around the world,</i>

07:34.454 --> 07:38.834
<i>calling for the establishment
of one world religion and one church.</i>

07:39.334 --> 07:41.795
‐ The group that's probably made
the most money in sushi

07:41.795 --> 07:43.255
is the Unification Church,

07:43.922 --> 07:45.549
<i>which has been labeled as a cult.</i>

07:46.884 --> 07:50.053
Reverend Moon said, "We're gonna
fund our operations with sushi.

07:50.053 --> 07:52.472
We're gonna popularize it."
And the rest is history.

07:53.682 --> 07:56.226
But I don't know how the fuck he saw it.

07:56.935 --> 08:01.773
It's‐‐ It borders on life is a simulation,
or he has a time machine.

08:02.399 --> 08:06.445
‐ At the age of 16,
you had a conversation with Jesus.

08:06.445 --> 08:07.946
‐ Uh, yes, he did.

08:08.614 --> 08:11.283
<i>Technically,
it's not the Unification Church,</i>

08:11.283 --> 08:13.952
it is one of their business entities
called True World.

08:15.162 --> 08:20.042
<i>I don't even know the extent
of True World's monopoly on sushi.</i>

08:21.084 --> 08:24.421
I have paranoid delusions of it,

08:24.421 --> 08:29.426
<i>like there's some Marvel‐like Hydra entity
with tons of little shell companies.</i>

08:30.177 --> 08:31.428
I don't know!

08:31.970 --> 08:33.514
<i>Let's pause for a second there, Dave.</i>

08:33.514 --> 08:34.348
<i>I've done some research,</i>

08:34.348 --> 08:36.600
<i>and this story
first came to light in 2006,</i>

08:36.600 --> 08:38.810
<i>based on reporting
from the</i> Chicago Tribune.

08:38.810 --> 08:41.688
<i>I just read through the articles
and my myth‐busting filter's kicking in,</i>

08:41.688 --> 08:44.024
<i>so let me throw
some fine print at you real quick.</i>

08:53.575 --> 08:54.826
<i>Okay, lawyers, are we good?</i>

08:55.702 --> 08:56.328
<i>Great!</i>

08:57.496 --> 09:00.791
<i>Growing up as a Korean,
I was sort of indoctrinated in my life,</i>

09:00.791 --> 09:01.959
<i>that's a cult,</i>

09:01.959 --> 09:05.420
so when I started Momofuku
and we started putting fish on the menu,

09:05.420 --> 09:07.297
I was like,
"I'm never gonna put True World on."

09:07.965 --> 09:10.217
<i>And I remember someone told me,</i>

09:10.217 --> 09:12.803
<i>"Okay, Dave. Good for you,
you're not buying from True World.</i>

09:12.803 --> 09:14.513
How do you know
that's not owned by True World?"

09:15.430 --> 09:19.476
<i>How do you know they're not buying fish
that were purchased from the port</i>

09:19.476 --> 09:20.894
<i>that is owned by True World?</i>

09:22.354 --> 09:24.273
<i>In this world that we live in,</i>

09:24.690 --> 09:28.944
<i>you can't keep yourself clean
from The Unification Church.</i>

09:34.992 --> 09:38.662
<i>It's clear that the myths of sushi
go much deeper than just freshness.</i>

09:38.662 --> 09:40.664
<i>But here's what I can tell you for sure.</i>

09:40.664 --> 09:41.915
<i>It's really popular.</i>

09:42.332 --> 09:47.004
<i>In 2021, sushi restaurants
are a $22.5‐billion‐dollar industry.</i>

09:47.337 --> 09:48.714
<i>But is that sustainable?</i>

09:51.091 --> 09:51.800
‐ No!

09:52.759 --> 09:53.468
No!

09:53.468 --> 09:56.054
<i>To find out,
let's get back to where sushi came from.</i>

09:56.555 --> 09:58.265
<i>They don't teach this
in American history class</i>

09:58.265 --> 09:59.558
<i>or anything really.</i>

09:59.558 --> 10:00.601
<i>So let's talk about it</i>

10:00.601 --> 10:03.520
<i>because I've read everything
you've written in English about sushi,</i>

10:03.520 --> 10:04.897
<i>and there's a lot more to it.</i>

10:05.480 --> 10:10.277
<i>Most people are missing
the complexity and history,</i>

10:10.277 --> 10:12.321
<i>and if they don't really know,</i>

10:12.321 --> 10:14.990
then it's gonna be seen as
like a hamburger.

10:14.990 --> 10:17.826
It's gonna be seen as
something that's disposable,

10:17.826 --> 10:19.411
something that can be delivered.

10:19.411 --> 10:23.999
<i>If you lose that appreciation,
then sushi sort of loses its meaning too.</i>

11:46.039 --> 11:48.083
<i>That was originally what sushi was about,</i>

11:48.083 --> 11:51.753
<i>a small‐time street food using local fish
that were in season.</i>

11:51.753 --> 11:54.381
<i>But two centuries later,
that's all slipped away,</i>

11:54.381 --> 11:56.175
<i>and you're trying to keep up with demand.</i>

11:56.175 --> 11:57.634
<i>It's like the summer of '98,</i>

11:57.634 --> 12:00.179
<i>when everybody wanted
a Big Mouth Billy Bass.</i>

12:00.179 --> 12:01.889
‐ We sold out immediately.

12:02.306 --> 12:04.766
<i>Everyone wanted one,
so no one could have one.</i>

12:04.766 --> 12:05.767
‐ Don't worry.

12:05.767 --> 12:08.103
<i>Humans just can't be trusted
with something they love.</i>

12:08.103 --> 12:09.271
‐ Be happy.
‐ Be happy.

12:11.648 --> 12:13.192
‐ We eat way too much sushi.

12:13.609 --> 12:17.112
And I don't think
people wanna really unpack sushi

12:17.112 --> 12:19.656
because once you unravel it...

12:21.033 --> 12:23.619
maybe you can't love
something that you really love.

13:16.547 --> 13:20.467
<i>In Japan, it depends where you are,
what time of year it is.</i>

13:20.467 --> 13:21.051
<i>Right.</i>

13:21.051 --> 13:23.178
‐ And that dictates what fish you eat.

13:23.178 --> 13:24.429
In America‐‐

13:24.429 --> 13:26.807
‐ No, no, no.
You‐‐ you can't underestimate that.

13:26.807 --> 13:30.060
I think Japanese as a culture,
Japan as a culture,

13:30.060 --> 13:34.314
has more understanding of seasonality
than any other place I've ever been,

13:34.314 --> 13:35.899
particularly when it comes to fish.

13:35.899 --> 13:38.777
They'll tell you, "The fish came
from this part of the water."

13:38.777 --> 13:43.156
That's how much the...
the‐‐ the diner <i>wants</i> to know

13:43.156 --> 13:44.533
because of the flavor,

13:44.533 --> 13:46.243
and also the chef wants to know too.

13:46.243 --> 13:50.163
It's like, "Oh, this Saba mackerel
is coming from these waters

13:50.163 --> 13:52.499
and it's been eating these things,
it's gonna be fattier."

13:52.499 --> 13:54.835
You're constantly adjusting your rice.

13:54.835 --> 13:57.754
‐ I never in my life,
until maybe the last couple of years,

13:57.754 --> 14:00.174
have thought of sushi as a seasonal food.

14:04.344 --> 14:05.888
In Japan, it's a fancy thing.

14:05.888 --> 14:06.889
‐ A special event.

14:06.889 --> 14:09.766
‐ You just think like,
"Sushi means raw fresh fish."

14:09.766 --> 14:13.228
‐ Fish is seasonal, they‐‐ they don't‐‐
They swim around!

14:13.228 --> 14:16.231
You don't have‐‐ You mean,
you don't have salmon all year round

14:16.231 --> 14:17.232
anywhere you go?

14:40.631 --> 14:45.469
‐ We've just become so accustomed
to getting whatever we want.

14:46.053 --> 14:49.473
<i>So the idea of running out of something,</i>

14:50.057 --> 14:51.975
<i>I don't know if people
understand that with food.</i>

14:53.352 --> 14:54.728
<i>You know, people want more.</i>

14:55.145 --> 14:56.897
Well, that more has to come
from somewhere.

15:45.487 --> 15:47.281
<i>Humans excel at many things.</i>

15:47.281 --> 15:48.866
<i>One of them is eating animals,</i>

15:48.866 --> 15:51.285
<i>which used to be a celebratory affair.</i>

15:51.285 --> 15:54.538
<i>But like most celebrations,
you tend to take things too far,</i>

15:55.122 --> 15:56.748
<i>kind of like Burning Man.</i>

16:02.796 --> 16:04.173
<i>Sushi really is just a vehicle</i>

16:04.173 --> 16:06.550
<i>to talk about
how we consume things at large.</i>

16:07.759 --> 16:09.052
It's about extinction.

16:11.722 --> 16:13.891
<i>Bluefin tuna's not going to be around.</i>

16:13.891 --> 16:17.060
It will be on the endangered list,
and you won't be able to eat it.

16:17.561 --> 16:22.232
<i>Also, we have destroyed the ability
to eat wild Atlantic salmon.</i>

16:22.232 --> 16:25.903
So anyone that tells you
they sell wild Atlantic salmon

16:25.903 --> 16:27.988
is straight up lying 'cause it's illegal.

16:27.988 --> 16:29.740
It's, like, fucking crazy to me.

16:31.742 --> 16:33.535
<i>If we stay on our current course,</i>

16:33.535 --> 16:36.163
<i>some scientists project
that all edible fish stocks</i>

16:36.163 --> 16:38.081
<i>will collapse by the year 2050.</i>

16:46.507 --> 16:48.634
<i>The funny thing is,
I think most people eat sushi</i>

16:48.634 --> 16:50.802
<i>thinking they're making the moral choice.</i>

16:50.802 --> 16:52.804
<i>You know,
they're on the right side of history.</i>

16:54.181 --> 16:55.641
<i>Just because it's fish</i>

16:55.641 --> 16:58.185
doesn't mean it's... good for the world.

16:59.728 --> 17:02.731
<i>When I start thinking
about the environment and fish, it just‐‐</i>

17:02.731 --> 17:06.527
<i>You‐‐ You go down this death spiral
of you're just gonna eat jellyfish.</i>

17:08.237 --> 17:09.446
And I hate jellyfish.

17:27.297 --> 17:28.924
Hello.

17:28.924 --> 17:30.092
How you doing?

17:30.092 --> 17:31.635
Pleasure.
Pleasure meeting you.

17:31.635 --> 17:33.345
‐ Hey, Todd.
Good to meet you.

17:33.345 --> 17:37.850
How many years
has your family been... fishing?

17:37.850 --> 17:43.397
‐ Just about 102 maybe, 104.
A little while.

17:43.397 --> 17:44.773
You guys are doing this.

17:44.773 --> 17:47.860
You and your peers
are taking the extra efforts,

17:47.860 --> 17:50.320
working with
the con‐‐ conservation groups.

17:50.320 --> 17:56.201
Why are you such an advocate
for this extra level of... governance?

17:56.201 --> 17:58.787
‐ As the fishermen
that are still fishing here,

17:58.787 --> 18:01.582
we‐‐ we have the greatest stake

18:01.582 --> 18:04.543
in making sure
that those fish are protected

18:04.543 --> 18:07.588
because everything
that our life hinges on,

18:07.588 --> 18:10.257
the whole value of our family,

18:10.257 --> 18:12.676
depends on those fish.

18:12.676 --> 18:15.387
So we unequivocally do not‐‐

18:15.387 --> 18:17.389
If we harm that, it's like‐‐

18:17.389 --> 18:20.100
You know, it's like
the‐‐ the tree growing the fruit, right?

18:20.100 --> 18:21.810
You cut the tree down,
you ain't getting more fruit.

18:22.770 --> 18:26.815
<i>For years,
I'd go eat at restaurants out here,</i>

18:26.815 --> 18:29.276
<i>and the fish would be from the east coast.
Yeah!</i>

18:29.276 --> 18:31.695
‐ Every time I was like, "Why can't
we just get fish from out here?"

18:31.695 --> 18:33.197
‐ Exactly.
And now you have.

18:33.197 --> 18:34.448
What was the gap?

18:34.448 --> 18:38.202
Because, clearly, you have been catching
this stuff‐‐ your family for 102 years.

18:38.202 --> 18:39.328
What was the disconnect?

18:39.328 --> 18:44.583
‐ There was a‐‐ There was a disconnect,
probably about an 18‐year gap or so

18:44.583 --> 18:48.379
when, uh,
there was poor management earlier.

18:48.379 --> 18:50.422
<i>It was declared overfished.</i>

18:50.422 --> 18:54.134
<i>And, uh, the fishery
went through a remarkable, like, rebuild</i>

18:54.134 --> 18:57.179
<i>where they thought originally
when it started,</i>

18:57.179 --> 18:59.473
"These fish are gonna take 130 years

18:59.473 --> 19:01.767
and this guy is gonna take 90 years,
this guy‐‐"

19:01.767 --> 19:03.852
So we were like,
"I ain't gonna live that long."

19:03.852 --> 19:05.938
So, you know, we're in trouble here.

19:05.938 --> 19:07.064
To make a long story short,

19:07.064 --> 19:09.942
as these new fisheries policies
went into place,

19:09.942 --> 19:15.781
the fish, in about 12 or 14 years,
just like, <i>boom</i>, they just exploded.

19:16.740 --> 19:17.825
<i>The ocean was much healthier</i>

19:17.825 --> 19:20.744
<i>and came back much, much faster
than they thought.</i>

19:20.744 --> 19:24.081
<i>And now there was four species
of major concern</i>

19:24.081 --> 19:25.249
<i>and they're all off the list.</i>

19:25.916 --> 19:28.168
But, you know,
there's been huge prices paid

19:28.168 --> 19:30.170
for us to continue to do this.

19:30.170 --> 19:31.797
You can see all these cameras.

19:31.797 --> 19:34.967
A lot of this stuff was done
with the Nature Conservancy.

19:34.967 --> 19:38.637
So everything that this boat touches,
<i>everything</i>,

19:38.637 --> 19:41.598
is monitored and accounted for.

19:41.598 --> 19:45.227
‐ I mean, I would venture to guess
this is a rarity in the world.

19:45.227 --> 19:47.563
‐ Yeah, it's‐‐ it's‐‐ it's kinda‐‐
That's what's sad.

19:47.563 --> 19:51.650
It's ended up to be more
of a boutique‐like specialty item.

19:52.735 --> 19:54.987
<i>If I was asked 20 years ago
if people would start to care</i>

19:54.987 --> 19:57.197
about the prominence of their food
and sustainability,

19:57.197 --> 19:58.741
I would say no way.

19:58.741 --> 20:01.118
Um, but it matters now.

20:01.118 --> 20:04.037
And I don't think it has anything
to do with the older generation.

20:04.037 --> 20:07.833
It is, uh, thankfully, driven entirely
by the younger generation

20:07.833 --> 20:09.168
that wants fairness.

20:09.168 --> 20:11.587
They want to protect the future.

20:11.587 --> 20:14.923
So... I actually am hopeful.

20:16.967 --> 20:22.014
<i>But I think it will be a rarity
to eat wild fish.</i>

20:23.390 --> 20:25.350
<i>I was told, and I'm just trying
to have an understanding,</i>

20:25.350 --> 20:27.936
what is it exactly Wildtype do?

20:27.936 --> 20:30.397
‐ Yeah, so we've come up
with a way to make sushi,

20:30.397 --> 20:32.107
salmon, uh, in our case,

20:32.107 --> 20:34.068
uh, without using animals.

20:34.068 --> 20:39.490
So we grow cells
and sculpt them into fish meat.

20:39.490 --> 20:42.868
‐ What were you guys doing
before you started to recreate salmon

20:42.868 --> 20:45.245
in your‐‐ in your loft here?

20:46.413 --> 20:48.290
‐ So yeah, I was‐‐
I was working as a diplomat,

20:48.290 --> 20:50.209
talking a lot about food security.

20:50.209 --> 20:51.210
I took that home with me

20:51.210 --> 20:53.837
and just started learning
a lot about our food system.

20:53.837 --> 20:56.298
‐ So diplomat, cardiologist.

20:56.298 --> 20:58.509
Yeah, I was working
on heart regeneration.

20:58.509 --> 21:03.013
Looking at how our cells
can regrow after a heart attack.

21:03.013 --> 21:04.723
<i>I realized this can be applied</i>

21:04.723 --> 21:08.811
<i>to just grow the foods
that we love outside of the animal.</i>

21:10.270 --> 21:11.772
‐ Can we see it? Can we try it?

21:11.772 --> 21:13.190
Yeah, of course.
Absolutely!

21:17.236 --> 21:19.488
That's wild. Seriously, man.

21:19.488 --> 21:20.447
That's insane.

21:22.116 --> 21:25.452
Oh, my God! I think I can guess,
but why‐‐ why did you choose salmon?

21:25.452 --> 21:27.788
‐ It's one of
the most consumed fish in US.

21:27.788 --> 21:30.582
It's one of the healthiest fish to eat.

21:30.582 --> 21:33.085
Things like omega‐3 fatty acids
and so forth.

21:33.085 --> 21:34.753
‐ People want it.

21:34.753 --> 21:37.715
And usually every kind of marketing lie

21:37.715 --> 21:40.426
is sold to the consumer
about the sustainability.

21:40.426 --> 21:43.554
But people don't realize
that it's a seasonal fish.

21:43.554 --> 21:46.014
Right. Yeah, you can have it
all year around,

21:46.014 --> 21:47.516
which seems a little strange, right?

21:47.516 --> 21:49.351
But you shouldn't.
‐ Yeah, that's right, yeah.

21:49.351 --> 21:51.478
‐ Which is why smoking
and preserving salmon

21:51.478 --> 21:55.232
became, you know,
such a popular means of consuming it.

21:55.232 --> 22:00.612
But 95% of all smoked salmon consumed
is from farm‐raised garbage.

22:00.612 --> 22:03.323
And I mean that. You know, <i>garbage.</i>

22:03.323 --> 22:07.286
Salmon, for the most part, farm raised,
is horrible.

22:07.286 --> 22:10.831
There's one place that might be
growing it right in New Zealand.

22:10.831 --> 22:14.418
Um, and I try my best to‐‐ to not do that

22:14.418 --> 22:16.837
because I do like the fish
and I do respect salmon.

22:16.837 --> 22:18.464
I love the seasonal aspect

22:18.464 --> 22:21.467
of California king salmon,
and Alaskan king salmon.

22:21.467 --> 22:25.262
Um, and I hope one day
that we'll be able to replenish the ocean

22:25.262 --> 22:28.557
and fish and eat Atlantic wild salmon.

22:28.557 --> 22:30.392
Right. Oh, yes, yeah.

22:31.769 --> 22:33.270
‐ Microphone's right there.

22:35.230 --> 22:36.356
Yeah, enjoy.

22:40.569 --> 22:41.445
Mind if we join you?

22:41.445 --> 22:42.613
Hmm.
‐ Yeah.

22:45.532 --> 22:46.950
‐ Delicious.

22:46.950 --> 22:49.244
‐ I mean, that's very good.
That's very‐‐ It's‐‐

22:50.496 --> 22:53.665
‐ I mean, you read about it.
You know, like, one day...

22:53.665 --> 22:55.250
‐ Yeah. I didn't know it was <i>today.</i>

22:57.169 --> 22:58.879
‐ Can I just try some of the raw?
Yeah.

23:01.965 --> 23:04.426
What percentage of Americans,
if you gave that to them,

23:04.426 --> 23:07.971
would even balk for a quarter second?

23:07.971 --> 23:09.515
99% of people wouldn't know.

23:09.515 --> 23:10.849
Would have no fucking idea.

23:10.849 --> 23:13.977
‐ But do sushi chefs in Japan
actually use this?

23:14.770 --> 23:18.023
Sushi has‐‐
has a history of reinventing itself.

23:18.023 --> 23:20.317
And‐‐ and we thought this is‐‐

23:20.317 --> 23:23.028
this is just part
of what the future of sushi is.

23:23.028 --> 23:23.862
‐ Yeah.

23:57.229 --> 24:02.651
I mean, Nick, do you think that
you'll ever use lab‐grown tuna?

24:02.651 --> 24:05.904
‐ I guess if it‐‐
If it's, like, safe for the Earth

24:05.904 --> 24:09.950
and there's no labor craziness
and there's no corruption,

24:09.950 --> 24:11.326
yeah, definitely open to it.

24:11.326 --> 24:14.329
What about sushiyas in Japan,
like the top ones? They ain't gonna‐‐

24:14.329 --> 24:16.331
Probably not. I don't think‐‐

24:16.331 --> 24:18.292
‐ But then it'll be like a luxury, right?

24:19.126 --> 24:21.170
I think just regular everyday sushi

24:21.170 --> 24:23.756
should be done at a lab maybe, you know?

24:23.756 --> 24:27.051
And this should be the place you come
for, you know, the special occasion.

24:28.427 --> 24:30.262
I love this piece so much.

24:31.013 --> 24:33.182
This has got his signature on this.

24:33.182 --> 24:34.224
‐ Oh, my God!

24:34.224 --> 24:38.562
Because you never see
Thai bird chili on sushi.

24:39.229 --> 24:40.647
This is‐‐ This is New York.

24:40.647 --> 24:43.442
Okay.
‐ This is real innovation, right?

24:43.442 --> 24:47.613
Um, and I think a significant moment
in sushi in America.

24:47.613 --> 24:50.157
I mean,
it also is significant in my mouth.

24:50.157 --> 24:51.784
‐ Oh, my God!
Yeah.

24:54.286 --> 24:56.288
‐ Come on, man.
I know! It's crazy!

24:56.789 --> 25:00.042
That's all of his life's work
in‐‐ in one bite.

25:00.042 --> 25:02.211
If you didn't work in all the restaurants
you've worked in before,

25:02.211 --> 25:03.796
would you have come up
with something like that?

25:03.796 --> 25:04.880
‐ I don't think so.

25:04.880 --> 25:07.007
‐ You need to learn the rules
to break the rules,

25:07.007 --> 25:09.218
to then do your own thing.
Right. Definitely.

25:09.218 --> 25:11.762
‐ And I eat sushi all over the place.

25:11.762 --> 25:14.890
I never have anything that tastes like
the sushi that's made here.

25:17.101 --> 25:21.230
This is a new way of doing it
while being respectful.

25:21.230 --> 25:24.691
‐ So what I want to see more of
is innovation in sushi.

25:26.735 --> 25:30.197
<i>Sometimes innovation means
applying old ways to new materials.</i>

25:32.074 --> 25:34.993
<i>In the case of sushi,
we're talking about local ideas,</i>

25:34.993 --> 25:36.787
<i>local flavors, and no myths,</i>

25:37.746 --> 25:38.914
<i>like this place is doing.</i>

25:39.706 --> 25:41.500
<i>After all, I'm sure you're getting hungry.</i>

25:41.500 --> 25:43.377
<i>This whole episode has been
about what you shouldn't eat.</i>

25:43.377 --> 25:44.962
<i>So here's something you should.</i>

25:47.923 --> 25:49.842
<i>We're talking about the future of food.</i>

25:49.842 --> 25:52.886
<i>It is all pretty bad for the most part.</i>

25:52.886 --> 25:55.097
<i>But the one possible silver lining is</i>

25:55.097 --> 25:58.225
<i>I think food's
gonna get crazy interesting.</i>

25:59.852 --> 26:02.938
<i>So how long has the Sinaloan sushi thing
been happening?</i>

26:02.938 --> 26:04.690
‐ Really 15 years.

26:04.690 --> 26:08.110
I mean, it started in Sinaloa.
That goes back 20, 25 years.

26:08.110 --> 26:10.320
<i>Of course, if you're from Mexico,</i>

26:10.320 --> 26:12.906
<i>you know that when it comes to seafood,
the Sinaloenses,</i>

26:12.906 --> 26:15.117
<i>they're the ones
who fucking killed the game.</i>

26:15.117 --> 26:18.370
‐ I've been
to a handful of Sinaloan restaurants,

26:18.370 --> 26:19.997
Mexican, Japanese food,

26:19.997 --> 26:21.206
and I love it.

26:21.206 --> 26:24.835
<i>You know, like, it should not work,
but somehow it works,</i>

26:24.835 --> 26:27.296
<i>and it's everything that I love.</i>

26:27.296 --> 26:30.007
And it's fusion that's done
in a way that makes sense.

26:30.007 --> 26:31.091
This side right here.

26:31.091 --> 26:32.134
Ah, <i>aguachile.</i>

26:32.134 --> 26:34.053
This is the green <i>aguachile</i> right here.

26:34.053 --> 26:35.220
Oh, my God.

26:36.889 --> 26:39.183
<i>How long have you had this restaurant?</i>

26:39.183 --> 26:41.143
‐ Like four years and a half pretty much.

26:41.143 --> 26:43.979
Uh, last year, you know,
like happened these things and like‐‐

26:43.979 --> 26:47.483
I used to work in a‐‐
in a famous restaurant.

26:47.483 --> 26:49.234
I used to work in Nobu.
Nobu, right?

26:49.234 --> 26:52.488
‐ Nobu Malibu, and I met a lot of people.

26:52.488 --> 26:56.283
That's how I am start to do, like,
little by little.

26:56.283 --> 26:58.243
‐ This is amazing food. It really is.

26:58.243 --> 27:00.496
Thank you so much.
‐ And I think we're tasting the future.

27:00.496 --> 27:02.039
‐ I don't say I'm the best,

27:02.039 --> 27:05.209
but the thing is, like,
I use a little bit different things

27:05.209 --> 27:06.960
than somebody else used it.

27:06.960 --> 27:08.837
You know, ingre‐‐ ingredients.

27:08.837 --> 27:10.881
‐ He's gonna be the Sinaloan Nobu.

27:10.881 --> 27:12.883
You're gonna be
the Sinaloense Nobu, yeah.

27:12.883 --> 27:13.926
‐ I wish, I wish.

27:19.932 --> 27:24.269
This is as good or better
than any Nobu you'll ever go to.

27:26.188 --> 27:27.523
No one wants to talk about that.

27:27.523 --> 27:28.732
No, of course not!

27:28.732 --> 27:30.359
This is fucking great food.
This is great food.

27:30.359 --> 27:33.237
But because it's in a working class city,
done by a Mexican,

27:33.237 --> 27:34.988
no one's gonna give it the respect
that it deserves.

27:49.920 --> 27:51.964
<i>This is, uh,</i> guamuchilito.

27:51.964 --> 27:54.883
<i>They come with octopus, shrimp,</i>

27:54.883 --> 27:56.802
and a Kani salad roll.

28:09.189 --> 28:12.151
‐ This is the <i>guamuchilito</i> right here.
‐ There it is.

28:12.151 --> 28:15.487
‐ This we call <i>el dragón</i>, dragon roll.
‐ <i>El dragón.</i>

28:28.125 --> 28:29.752
‐ More tacos.
Oh, I love these tacos.

28:30.419 --> 28:31.962
Holy cow!

28:31.962 --> 28:33.505
‐ Come on, man!

28:33.505 --> 28:34.923
I actually think that this food

28:34.923 --> 28:37.968
is closer
to the original spirit of sushi

28:37.968 --> 28:40.846
than a lot of the <i>omakase</i> stuff
that you see now.

28:40.846 --> 28:43.182
It is made with what's available.

28:43.182 --> 28:44.767
It's convenient.

28:44.767 --> 28:47.561
‐ Exactly. This is food
left to its own devices.

28:47.561 --> 28:52.149
Whether people are forced
or willingly travel to other places

28:52.149 --> 28:55.277
and work together, and live together,
and eat together,

28:55.277 --> 28:57.696
you know, it's, like,
it's going to eventually happen.

28:57.696 --> 29:01.200
This could be something
Americans can be proud of.

29:01.200 --> 29:01.992
Oh, yeah.

29:10.751 --> 29:11.877
‐ Chef.

29:17.925 --> 29:21.345
‐ Oh, the size!
Can we spike this one?

29:25.057 --> 29:29.395
So I recommend just, uh, you know,
squeeze lemon and a green tea salt.

29:29.395 --> 29:30.729
What do you think?

29:30.729 --> 29:32.689
‐ It's great for halibut.

29:34.400 --> 29:37.361
‐ It dry out after cooking.
It's dry.

29:38.946 --> 29:40.364
<i>This is a special treat.</i>

29:40.364 --> 29:43.700
And one thing about sushi like this
is you shouldn't eat this every day.

29:43.700 --> 29:46.412
<i>That's what happened to sushi.
It was like‐‐ It was a treat.</i>

29:46.412 --> 29:50.124
<i>It was a special occasion,
and then it became a grocery store thing.</i>

29:50.124 --> 29:52.751
‐ I'm a loud person by nature.

29:52.751 --> 29:55.587
By when I'm in a sushi‐‐ sushi shop,
I'm like...

29:55.587 --> 29:56.797
‐ Right.

29:58.340 --> 30:00.467
<i>It's a respect thing.
Mm‐hmm.</i>

30:00.467 --> 30:03.762
<i>Like, for example, most people
that go into a church, a cathedral,</i>

30:03.762 --> 30:06.473
<i>know not to take their shoes off
and put their feet on the pew.</i>

30:06.473 --> 30:07.433
<i>You know what I mean?</i>

30:08.392 --> 30:10.519
<i>There is a version
of what you're talking about, Dave,</i>

30:10.519 --> 30:12.271
where, like, you come to a sushi bar,

30:12.271 --> 30:14.481
you should be respectful,
you should be quiet.

30:14.481 --> 30:16.024
That's intimidating to people.

30:16.024 --> 30:18.026
No, you don't have to say anything.

30:18.026 --> 30:21.071
When you come to a sushi bar,
you'll be like, "Whatever you want, chef."

30:21.071 --> 30:22.197
That's it.
‐ Yeah.

30:22.197 --> 30:25.075
You can't really compare
Japanese knowledge of food

30:25.075 --> 30:27.536
to anywhere else in the world.

30:27.536 --> 30:32.499
They just have a longer history
of food culture and appreciation

30:32.499 --> 30:33.417
than we do.

30:33.417 --> 30:36.295
Given time, we will get better at it.

30:36.295 --> 30:39.214
And that's why I feel confident
that sushi will become something

30:39.214 --> 30:40.883
that is much more understood.

30:40.883 --> 30:42.593
‐ You think so?
‐ I do.

30:42.593 --> 30:44.928
‐ That's the most hopeful thing
I've ever heard you say.

30:44.928 --> 30:47.514
‐ I know. Can you believe that?
No!

30:47.514 --> 30:49.433
‐ Maybe I have a concussion or something.

30:52.102 --> 30:55.689
What do you think?
In 50 years, what's the future hold?

30:55.689 --> 30:58.233
‐ I'm hoping that myself and my kids,
they live in a world

30:58.233 --> 31:00.986
where we all know
where our fish comes from

31:00.986 --> 31:02.446
<i>and who caught it.</i>

31:02.446 --> 31:04.656
<i>One day, you'll be able to see a menu</i>

31:04.656 --> 31:06.825
where you can have wild caught salmon,

31:06.825 --> 31:08.202
you can have farm salmon,

31:08.202 --> 31:11.413
and you can have Wildtype salmon
as an alternative.

31:11.413 --> 31:13.499
<i>‐ ♪ Here where you are standing ♪</i>

31:23.509 --> 31:25.594
‐ I think the reason
why sushi is here at all

31:25.594 --> 31:27.346
is because it's constantly adapted.

31:28.472 --> 31:29.848
Thank you, chef.

31:29.848 --> 31:32.101
<i>It's morphed and evolved</i>

31:32.101 --> 31:34.353
because it's trying to survive.

31:40.526 --> 31:46.365
<i>‐ ♪ We live in the city of dreams ♪</i>

31:50.911 --> 31:56.583
<i>♪ We drive on this highway of fire ♪</i>
