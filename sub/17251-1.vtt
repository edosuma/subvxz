WEBVTT

00:02.381 --> 00:03.496
- YOU KNOW
WHO I GOT A THING FOR?

00:03.520 --> 00:04.935
THE NEW ANCHOR ON ACTION NEWS.

00:04.970 --> 00:06.765
- OH, LITTLE BLONDE GIRL.
SHE'S CUTE.

00:06.799 --> 00:08.432
- YEAH, PLUS I GET AN IDEA THAT
SHE'D BE NICE BEHIND THE SCENES.

00:08.456 --> 00:09.778
LIKE, THE CREW WOULD LOVE HER.
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

00:09.802 --> 00:11.252
- DO YOU KNOW
WHO I GOT A THING FOR?

00:11.287 --> 00:13.254
- WHO?
- THE NEW SPORTS GUY ON WGN.

00:13.289 --> 00:16.706
- THAT GUY?
I DON'T THINK HE'S GAY, DUDE.

00:16.740 --> 00:19.088
- OH, HE'S GAY.

00:19.122 --> 00:20.606
- HOW DO YOU KNOW?
- HE KNOWS.

00:20.641 --> 00:22.263
HE'S THE DICK WHISPERER.

00:22.298 --> 00:23.540
YES, I AM.

00:23.575 --> 00:25.232
BESIDES,
I SLEPT WITH HIM LAST WEEK.

00:25.266 --> 00:27.027
- SHUT UP!

00:27.061 --> 00:28.349
- ALL RIGHT, YOU TWO. I NEED YOU
TO GO DOWN TO HEADQUARTERS.

00:28.373 --> 00:29.960
YOU GOT A NEW GUY
COMING ON THE RIG.

00:29.995 --> 00:31.203
- AND YOU BEST BE ON TIME.

00:31.238 --> 00:33.171
I HEAR HE'S AN EX-NAVY SEAL.

00:33.205 --> 00:34.689
- NO.
- OH, NO, COME ON.

00:34.724 --> 00:36.381
- THIS GUY'S GONNA BE
A PAIN IN THE ASS.

00:36.415 --> 00:37.427
- WE NEED A LITTLE DISCIPLINE
AROUND HERE.

00:37.451 --> 00:39.453
- STEP UP YOUR GAME
A LITTLE BIT.

00:39.487 --> 00:40.775
- OH, MAN, MY GAME IS GREAT.
I WAS ALREADY IN THE MILITARY.

00:40.799 --> 00:42.559
- YEAH, WELL, WHATEVER.
THAT'S WHAT YOU SAY.

00:42.594 --> 00:44.399
- TEACH YOU SOMETHING. WE NEED
A LITTLE DISCIPLINE AROUND HERE.

00:44.423 --> 00:46.425
- IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE
CALLING IT THESE DAYS?

00:46.460 --> 00:49.394
- YOU GUYS WANT
A TOOTSIE ROLL, EH?

00:49.428 --> 00:53.536
OH, TOOTSIE ROLL, TOOTSIE ROLL.
YOU ARE DELICIOUS AND TIMELESS.

00:53.570 --> 00:55.617
- I THOUGHT I HEARD THAT
YOU WERE WITH THE NAVY SEALS.

00:55.641 --> 00:58.299
- NAVY? NO, NO.
EASTER SEALS.

00:58.334 --> 01:00.922
I VOLUNTEERED.
THIS IS SO COOL.

01:00.957 --> 01:03.615
FIRST DAY ON THE JOB.
DO YOU GUYS FACEBOOK?

01:03.649 --> 01:06.445
- NO. NO, I DON'T FACEBOOK.
I DON'T DO REGULAR BOOKS.

01:06.480 --> 01:07.733
I EAT, AND I SLEEP,
AND I SAVE LIVES.

01:07.757 --> 01:09.897
- HE'S A VERY COMPLICATED MAN.

01:09.931 --> 01:11.485
- HEY, I CONTROL TECHNOLOGY.

01:11.519 --> 01:13.107
I DON'T LET TECHNOLOGY
CONTROL ME.

01:13.142 --> 01:15.144
- OH, THAT MEANS THAT
HE CAN ACCESS ONLINE PORN

01:15.178 --> 01:16.328
FROM HIS PHONE
WHILE HE'S DRIVING.

01:16.352 --> 01:17.663
- YEAH, THERE'S GOTTA BE

01:17.698 --> 01:19.734
SOME KIND OF FANCY NAME
FOR THAT, RIGHT?

01:19.769 --> 01:21.091
- LAST TIME I CHECKED, IT WAS
STILL CALLED "JERKING OFF."

01:21.115 --> 01:22.748
- CHICAGO NORTH 115,
REPORT OF POSSIBLE HEART ATTACK,

01:22.772 --> 01:24.463
CORNER OF LINCOLN, JEFFERSON.

01:24.498 --> 01:26.165
- AMBULANCE 14 RESPONDING.
- HERE, HOLD THAT.

01:26.189 --> 01:27.615
HANG ON, EASTER SEAL.
I KNOW A SHORTCUT.

01:27.639 --> 01:28.778
OOH.

01:30.331 --> 01:31.643
- LOOK OUT,
TOW TRUCK, TOW TRUCK!

01:33.196 --> 01:34.956
WOW.

01:34.991 --> 01:36.865
- HERE, GIVE ME THE COFFEE.
MIGHT WANT TO SAY A ROSARY TOO.

01:36.889 --> 01:38.660
- THIS COMING FROM THE GUY
WHO DOESN'T BELIEVE IN GOD.

01:38.684 --> 01:40.110
- I DIDN'T SAY
I DON'T BELIEVE IN GOD.

01:40.134 --> 01:41.929
I SAID I BELIEVE
THAT MICHAEL JORDAN IS GOD.

01:41.963 --> 01:43.493
- OH, THEN WHY AREN'T YOU
WEARING A SCOTTIE PIPPIN MEDAL

01:43.517 --> 01:44.873
AROUND YOUR NECK
INSTEAD OF ST. JUDE?

01:44.897 --> 01:46.457
- RIGHT.
WHO'S COMPLICATED NOW, ASSHOLE?

01:47.314 --> 01:48.936
- VICTIM APPEARS
NOT TO BE BREATHING.

01:48.970 --> 01:50.500
- LIKE YOU DON'T DOWNLOAD PORN
TO YOUR PHONE.

01:50.524 --> 01:52.260
- OH, I TRY TO KEEP
MY PHONE AWAY FROM MY DICK.

01:52.284 --> 01:53.484
HE ALWAYS WANTS TO CALL MY EX.

02:01.569 --> 02:02.363
- HE JUST FELL DOWN LIKE
HE WAS HAVING A HEART ATTACK!

02:02.398 --> 02:03.709
- IS HE CONSCIOUS?

02:03.744 --> 02:05.504
- NO. HE HIT HIS HEAD
WHEN HE FELL.

02:05.539 --> 02:07.137
- UH-HUH. MAKE A HOLE!
LET'S MOVE, MOVE, MOVE.

02:07.161 --> 02:08.207
GIVE HIM SOME SPACE.
- HE'S BEEN MAKING WEIRD NOISES.

02:08.231 --> 02:09.612
- HOW YOU DOING, BUDDY?

02:09.646 --> 02:11.200
BUDDY, YOU AWAKE?

02:11.234 --> 02:12.511
FIRE UP THE TOASTER, BRIAN.

02:12.546 --> 02:14.203
YEAH, HE DOESN'T HAVE A PULSE.

02:14.237 --> 02:17.206
- HEY.
FULL CHARGE.

02:17.240 --> 02:18.207
HERE, BRIAN.
- HERE.

02:18.241 --> 02:20.381
- OKAY.

02:20.416 --> 02:23.177

02:23.212 --> 02:25.283
- HERE.
- COME ON, GOD DAMN...

02:25.317 --> 02:29.218
- OKAY.

02:29.252 --> 02:32.807
BRIAN?

02:32.842 --> 02:34.740
WE'RE WAITING ON YOU, BRI.

02:34.775 --> 02:35.845
- OKAY.

02:35.879 --> 02:37.674
- CLEAR.
- KILL THE TOASTER.

02:37.709 --> 02:40.332
- JOHN?
- JUST GIVE ME A SECOND, BUDDY.

02:46.614 --> 02:50.273
COME ON, COME ON,
COME ON, COME ON, COME ON.

02:51.964 --> 02:54.312
OH!

02:54.346 --> 02:55.727
- OOH.
- HEY.

02:57.763 --> 03:00.559
HOLY SH...

03:00.594 --> 03:02.078
HOW YOU DOING?

03:02.112 --> 03:04.322
- HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT
THAT WAS A FOOD ALLERGY?

03:04.356 --> 03:06.703
- GO. GO.
- OH.

03:06.738 --> 03:10.569
UH, WELL, THE...
THE SWELLING IN THE LIPS.

03:10.604 --> 03:12.882
AND HE HAD THIS RASH.

03:12.916 --> 03:14.504
MY DAD HAD FOOD ALLERGIES.

03:14.539 --> 03:16.782
HE WAS ALLERGIC
TO SHELLFISH AND PEANUTS

03:16.817 --> 03:19.026
AND MARRIAGE, APPARENTLY.

03:19.060 --> 03:20.348
- OH, THIS IS MY NEW PARTNER,
DANNY.

03:20.372 --> 03:22.236
- HOW YOU DOING?
- GOOD. HOW YOU DOING?

03:22.271 --> 03:23.582
THIS IS OUR NEW GUY.
BRIAN.

03:23.617 --> 03:24.583
- HEY. HOW'S IT HANGING, BRI?

03:24.618 --> 03:26.896
- IT'S, UH...

03:26.930 --> 03:28.794
- AH!
- GOOD.

03:28.829 --> 03:32.281
- LOOK, I DON'T KNOW WHAT SHE'S
TELLING YOU ABOUT ME, BUT...

03:32.315 --> 03:34.766
- NOT A LOT.
- REALLY?

03:34.800 --> 03:36.285
- GREAT EMT.

03:36.319 --> 03:37.710
- SHE REALLY
HASN'T SAID ANYTHING...

03:37.734 --> 03:40.220
NOTHING NEGATIVE
ABOUT ME AT ALL? COME ON.

03:40.254 --> 03:41.911
- SHE MENTIONED
THE CAR CRASH LAST WEEK,

03:41.945 --> 03:43.153
WHERE YOU RESCUED THE DRIVER

03:43.188 --> 03:43.982
JUST SECONDS
BEFORE THE CAR EXPLODED.

03:44.016 --> 03:45.570
- WHICH WAS AMAZING.

03:45.604 --> 03:47.157
AND WHAT'S EVEN
MORE AMAZING IS THAT

03:47.192 --> 03:49.470
HE CAN INSTANTANEOUSLY
DIVE INTO A BURNING WRECK

03:49.505 --> 03:51.265
TO SAVE THE LIFE
OF A COMPLETE STRANGER.

03:51.300 --> 03:53.060
BUT WHEN IT COMES
TO MOVING IN

03:53.094 --> 03:55.407
WITH HIS GIRLFRIEND OF THREE
YEARS, HE REMAINS UNDECIDED.

03:55.442 --> 03:57.098
WE'RE ON A BREAK.

03:58.859 --> 04:00.999
- UH, WELL, WE NEED
A STATEMENT FROM SECURITY.

04:01.033 --> 04:02.483
- NICE MEETING YOU, JOHNNY.

04:02.518 --> 04:04.416
- YOU TOO, DONNY.

04:04.451 --> 04:05.831
- DANNY.

04:05.866 --> 04:08.765
- SO, UH...

04:08.800 --> 04:10.077
HI.
- HI.

04:12.700 --> 04:15.979
- YOUR VEST LOOKS NICE TODAY.

04:16.014 --> 04:18.016
- OH, YEAH, THANK YOU.

04:20.984 --> 04:24.298
- SO ARE YOU, UH, DOING OKAY?

04:24.333 --> 04:27.025
- I'M... YEAH, I'M GOOD.
- GOOD.

04:27.059 --> 04:29.165
- YOU?

04:29.199 --> 04:32.686
- WHAT IF I WAS TO SAY...
NO?

04:32.720 --> 04:34.998
NO.

04:37.829 --> 04:39.013
- PLEASE TELL ME
I'M NOT AN IDIOT.

04:39.037 --> 04:40.832
- YOU'RE NOT AN IDIOT.

04:43.869 --> 04:51.869
♪

05:04.200 --> 05:06.029
- SHE... SHE WOULDN'T HAVE SAID
ALL THAT STUFF

05:06.064 --> 05:07.686
ABOUT ME
TO WHAT'S-HIS-FACE

05:07.721 --> 05:09.895
IF SHE DIDN'T STILL CARE
ABOUT ME, OBVIOUSLY.

05:09.930 --> 05:11.311
- ALTERNATIVE THEORY.

05:11.345 --> 05:12.829
IT'S PART
OF HER SECRET EVIL PLAN

05:12.864 --> 05:14.220
TO GET IN
HER NEW PARTNER DENZEL'S PANTS.

05:14.244 --> 05:16.074
- UH, DANNY.
PRETTY SURE IT WAS DANNY.

05:16.108 --> 05:17.627
- OH, DENZEL TO ME.

05:17.662 --> 05:19.215
HOT, MO' BETTER BLUESDENZEL,

05:19.249 --> 05:20.803
WITH JUST A TOUCH
OF TERRENCE HOWARD.

05:20.837 --> 05:22.805
- YOU REALLY THINK
HE LOOKED LIKE DENZEL?

05:22.839 --> 05:24.714
- DEVIL IN A BLUE DRESS,
DEAD RINGER, BRO. BANDAGES.

05:24.738 --> 05:26.878
WHAT'S YOUR NAME, SIR?
- PETE.

05:26.912 --> 05:28.328
- OKAY, PETE.
YOU'RE DOING GREAT.

05:28.362 --> 05:29.329
WE'RE GONNA PATCH YOU UP
REAL GOOD NOW.

05:29.363 --> 05:30.571
I GOT YOUR CELL PHONE HERE.

05:30.606 --> 05:32.031
WHO DO YOU CALL
IN CASE OF EMERGENCY?

05:32.055 --> 05:34.472
- MY BROTHER.
HE'S LISTED UNDER I.C.E.

05:34.506 --> 05:37.233
- "IN CASE OF EMERGENCY."
NICELY DONE, PETE.

05:37.267 --> 05:38.579
SAFETY GOLD STAR FOR YOU.

05:38.614 --> 05:40.098
- I DON'T THINK
HE LOOKED LIKE DENZEL.

05:40.132 --> 05:41.893
I THINK HE LOOKED
LIKE DENNIS RODMAN, MAYBE.

05:41.927 --> 05:43.180
- THAT'S 'CAUSE YOU'RE
LOOKING AT HIM THROUGH

05:43.204 --> 05:44.896
ANGRY EX-BOYFRIEND
COCK GOGGLES.

05:44.930 --> 05:46.252
TAKE IT FROM ME
AS YOUR BEST FRIEND

05:46.276 --> 05:47.726
WHO'S LOOKING AT HIM
THROUGH SINGLE,

05:47.761 --> 05:49.728
HE'S HOT.

05:49.763 --> 05:51.385
DENZEL-BANGING-HOLLYWOOD-BITCHES
HOT.

05:51.420 --> 05:52.904
I'M GAY, BY THE WAY.

05:52.938 --> 05:54.181
- OH.

05:54.215 --> 05:54.906
- YOU SEEM SURPRISED.

05:54.940 --> 05:56.908
NO.

05:56.942 --> 05:58.496
YES.

05:58.530 --> 06:00.877
THERESA'S STILL YOUR I.C.E.,
ISN'T SHE?

06:00.912 --> 06:02.638
STUPID GODDAMN QUESTION.

06:02.672 --> 06:04.881
- YOU KNOW WHO I THINK
IS A GOOD-LOOKING GUY?

06:04.916 --> 06:05.986
TIM TEBOW.

06:06.020 --> 06:08.540
PLUS HE SEEMS SO NICE.

06:08.575 --> 06:09.990
- WHO'S YOUR I.C.E., BRIAN?

06:10.024 --> 06:12.648
- MY MOM.
- YOUR MOM?

06:12.682 --> 06:14.270
- WELL, SHE LIVES
RIGHT UPSTAIRS.

06:14.304 --> 06:15.489
- YOU STILL LIVE
WITH YOUR PARENTS?

06:15.513 --> 06:16.859
NO.

06:16.893 --> 06:19.171
NAH, THEY LIVE UPSTAIRS,
I LIVE DOWNSTAIRS.

06:19.206 --> 06:20.656
IT'S A WHOLE SEPARATE FLOOR.

06:20.690 --> 06:23.175
- YOU GOT A GIRLFRIEND?
- I HAD ONE.

06:23.210 --> 06:24.867
WE JUST BROKE UP.
SHE, UH...

06:24.901 --> 06:26.765
SHE GOT TOO CLINGY.

06:26.800 --> 06:30.942
- YOUR GIRLFRIEND'S TOO CLINGY,
TIM TEBOW IS HANDSOME,

06:30.976 --> 06:32.771
YOU SPORT... LET ME GUESS...

06:32.806 --> 06:33.531
SOMETHING FROM THE CALVIN KLEIN
FAMILY OF COLOGNES?

06:33.565 --> 06:35.740
- RAMPAGE.

06:35.774 --> 06:37.200
- I GOT A BETTER SHOT OF GETTING
SOME PUSSY TONIGHT THAN YOU,

06:37.224 --> 06:39.019
AND ALL I'M THINKING ABOUT
IS DENZEL'S LIPS.

06:39.053 --> 06:40.020
- AH, CAN WE STOP
CALLING HIM DENZEL?

06:40.054 --> 06:41.366
- I THOUGHT HE LOOKED LIKE

06:41.401 --> 06:44.714
A YOUNG, MORE MUSCLEY
HARRY BELAFONTE.

06:44.749 --> 06:46.278
- HOW DO YOU EVEN KNOW
WHO HARRY BELAFONTE IS?

06:46.302 --> 06:48.891
- 'CAUSE HE'S WATCHING TV
WITH HIS PARENTS.

06:57.831 --> 07:00.937
- YOU REALLY THINK
HE LOOKED LIKE DENZEL?

07:00.972 --> 07:02.629
- BRIAN, GET US SOME GATORADES.

07:02.663 --> 07:04.054
- GATORADE PRIME,
GATORADE PERFORMANCE,

07:04.078 --> 07:06.046
OR GATORADE RECOVER?

07:06.080 --> 07:06.909
- LET'S GO WITH YELLOW.

07:06.943 --> 07:09.118
- I LIKE YELLOW.

07:09.152 --> 07:10.568
- 'KAY.

07:10.602 --> 07:12.604
I KNOW, I KNOW.

07:12.639 --> 07:14.434
YOU KNOW, DON'T JUDGE ME.

07:14.468 --> 07:16.584
DO YOU REMEMBER HOW LONG IT TOOK
YOU TO GET OVER JEFF THE CHEF?

07:16.608 --> 07:18.748
- TWO DAYS
AND A WEEKEND TRIP TO MIAMI.

07:18.783 --> 07:20.899
- WHICH, IN GAY MAN'S TIME,
IS LIKE SIX GODDAMN MONTHS.

07:20.923 --> 07:23.615
- SO NOT COOL, BRO.
TRUE, BUT NOT COOL.

07:23.650 --> 07:26.722
- IT'S JUST...
SHE WAS MY EVERYTHING.

07:26.756 --> 07:28.551
AND YEAH, SHE'S STILL MY I.C.E.

07:28.586 --> 07:29.794
- WHICH IS RIDICULOUS.

07:29.828 --> 07:31.554
I CHUCKED JEFF THE CHEF
AS MY I.C.E.

07:31.589 --> 07:33.763
A WEEK BEFORE I KICKED
HIS PRETTY ASS OUT.

07:33.798 --> 07:35.834
- WHO'S YOUR I.C.E. NOW?
- I HAVEN'T DECIDED.

07:35.869 --> 07:37.767
- YOU KNOW WHAT WE SHOULD DO
IS WE SHOULD FORGET

07:37.802 --> 07:39.469
ABOUT THESE GIRLFRIENDS
AND THESE BOYFRIENDS,

07:39.493 --> 07:40.815
AND WE SHOULD BE
EACH OTHER'S I.C.E.

07:40.839 --> 07:42.254
THAT'S FUNNY.

07:42.289 --> 07:43.117
- WHAT?
I'M NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU?

07:43.152 --> 07:44.981
- OH, LISTEN, LOOK.

07:45.016 --> 07:46.856
I WANT THE PERSON I CALL
IN A LIFE-AND-DEATH SITUATION

07:46.880 --> 07:48.433
TO BE SOMEONE SPECIAL.

07:48.468 --> 07:51.091
NOT JEFF THE CHEF,
WHO CHEATED ON ME WITH A BUSBOY.

07:51.125 --> 07:52.920
SOMEONE HONEST AND TRUE.

07:52.955 --> 07:55.647
SOMEONE WHO IS GOING TO
SIT THERE AND TAKE MY HAND,

07:55.682 --> 07:57.960
LEAD ME THROUGH
TO THE OTHER SIDE

07:57.994 --> 08:00.928
BY LEANING DOWN
AND WHISPERING INTO MY EAR,

08:00.963 --> 08:04.276
TELLING ME HOW MUCH
THEY FEEL AND CARE ABOUT ME.

08:04.311 --> 08:06.934
WHEN I LEAVE THIS EARTH,

08:06.969 --> 08:10.144
I WANT TO FEEL HIS LOVING LIPS
BRUSHING UP AGAINST MY CHEEK,

08:10.179 --> 08:12.146
SAYING EVER SO SOFTLY,

08:12.181 --> 08:15.287
"I LOVE YOU, HENRY.

08:15.322 --> 08:19.015
AND I SHALL CONTINUE TO
LOVE YOU, ALWAYS AND FOREVER."

08:22.260 --> 08:25.953
- WAS IT THAT PUERTO RICAN
BUSBOY WITH THE DREADLOCKS?

08:25.988 --> 08:28.300
- I HATE YOU.
- YOU LOVE ME.

08:28.335 --> 08:31.545
- THAT WAS BEAUTIFUL, HANK.

08:31.580 --> 08:36.895
REALLY, REALLY TOUCHING STUFF.

08:36.930 --> 08:41.417
THEY ONLY HAD PURPLE.

08:41.451 --> 08:43.868
- DO YOU WANT TO TELL HIM?
- WE'RE MEN, BRI. WE DON'T CRY.

08:43.902 --> 08:46.146
FIRSTBORN KID,

08:46.180 --> 08:47.641
THE END OF FIELD OF DREAMS,
AND THE DAY MIKE DITKA DIES.

08:47.665 --> 08:49.425
- IF THAT EVER HAPPENS,
GOD FORBID.

08:49.459 --> 08:50.575
- IT'S OKAY TO GET MISTY,
RIGHT?

08:50.599 --> 08:52.359
- NO.
- NO.

08:52.393 --> 08:54.982
- YOU CAN GET MISTY IF
DITKA'S WIFE DIES BEFORE HE DOES

08:55.017 --> 08:57.813
AND YOU SEE HIM
TALKING ABOUT HER ON ESPN.

08:57.847 --> 09:00.229
OTHERWISE, "MISTY"

09:00.263 --> 09:03.577
SOUNDS REALLY, REALLY GAY.

09:03.612 --> 09:06.856
- NOW, WHO IS DITKA?

09:10.550 --> 09:12.586
- HOW'S THE FIRST DAY, BRIAN?
LEARNING ANYTHING?

09:12.621 --> 09:13.736
- I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I LEARNED.

09:13.760 --> 09:16.107
HE'S NOT A NAVY SEAL, AND...

09:16.141 --> 09:17.349
HE LIVES WITH HIS PARENTS.

09:17.384 --> 09:19.869
- OH, REALLY?
- HEY.

09:19.904 --> 09:22.423
SEPARATE FLOOR,
SEPARATE MAILBOX, GUYS.

09:22.458 --> 09:24.840
TOTALLY DIFFERENT SITUATION.
- MM-HMM.

09:24.874 --> 09:27.359
- AMBULANCE NEEDED.
742 EAST DIVERSEY.

09:27.394 --> 09:28.716
- HEY, BRI, YOU WANT
TO RUN POINT ON THIS CALL?

09:28.740 --> 09:30.604
- YOU THINK I'M READY?
- WHY NOT?

09:30.639 --> 09:32.951
YOU'RE BRAVE ENOUGH TO BEAT OFF
IN YOUR PARENTS' BASEMENT.

09:38.923 --> 09:40.476
- FIRST TIME OUT,
GUYS RARELY BEGIN

09:40.510 --> 09:42.109
BY STICKING AN ENTIRE
SODA BOTTLE UP THEIR ASS.

09:42.133 --> 09:43.489
- YEAH, USUALLY GUYS
START WITH SOMETHING SMALLER.

09:43.513 --> 09:44.939
YOU DIDN'T HAVE
ANY ZUCCHINI OR CARROTS?

09:44.963 --> 09:47.069
- I HAVE BOTH,
ACTUALLY, IT'S JUST...

09:47.103 --> 09:48.311
- IT'S JUST WHAT?

09:48.346 --> 09:50.037
- I WAS PLANNING
ON MAKING SOME SOUP.

09:50.072 --> 09:51.970
Both: OH.

09:52.005 --> 09:53.075
- UH, BRIAN.

09:53.109 --> 09:54.076
EXAMINE THE INJURY.

09:54.110 --> 09:55.491
- WHAT?

09:55.525 --> 09:57.217
- YOU WANTED TO RUN POINT.
- TAKE A LOOK.

10:09.678 --> 10:12.922
OOH, OOH, OOH, OOH.

10:16.029 --> 10:21.137
- UH, BRIAN, HOW'S IT LOOK?

10:21.172 --> 10:23.346
- IT'S UP THERE.

10:23.381 --> 10:25.314
IT'S REALLY UP THERE.

10:25.348 --> 10:26.936
- I COULD'VE TOLD YOU THAT.

10:26.971 --> 10:28.489
CAN YOU GET IT OUT?

10:28.524 --> 10:30.088
LOOK, I DON'T WANT TO GO
TO THE HOSPITAL, GUYS.

10:30.112 --> 10:32.079
- OH, NOT A PROBLEM, SIR.

10:32.114 --> 10:34.841
UH, BRI, RUN DOWN TO THE RIG
AND GET THE COLO-VAC 5,000.

10:34.875 --> 10:35.842
IT'S IN THE SIDE STORAGE TANK.
- AH.

10:35.876 --> 10:38.914
- COLO-VAC 5,000.

10:38.948 --> 10:42.469
- WOW. COLO-VAC 5,000.
THAT SOUNDS POWERFUL.

10:42.503 --> 10:43.435
IS THAT... IS IT GONNA HURT?

10:43.470 --> 10:45.541
- IT'S GONNA HURT A LOT.

10:45.575 --> 10:46.991
MAINLY BECAUSE
IT DOESN'T EXIST.

10:47.025 --> 10:48.544
- WELL, HE RAN
LIKE A BAT OUTTA HELL

10:48.578 --> 10:50.270
AS SOON AS YOU SAID THE NAME.
- HE'S NEW.

10:50.304 --> 10:52.030
AND WE ARE PARAMEDICS, SIR.

10:52.065 --> 10:54.274
EVEN IF THERE WAS A DEVICE
THAT SUCKED SODA BOTTLES

10:54.308 --> 10:57.311
OUT OF THE PLACE WE DARE NOT GO,
OUR BUDGET WOULDN'T COVER IT.

10:57.346 --> 10:58.761
- WE BARELY GET DENTAL,

10:58.796 --> 11:00.556
LET ALONE ANAL.

11:00.590 --> 11:03.214
- WE'RE GOING TO THE HOSPITAL.
- OH, MAN.

11:03.248 --> 11:06.355
- GUYS, LOOK, I'LL GIVE YOU 2
GRAND IF YOU TRY TO GET IT OUT.

11:06.389 --> 11:08.391

THE TWINK DO IT.

11:08.426 --> 11:11.325
SLOWER. PLEASE, SLOWER.

11:11.360 --> 11:13.880
JUST A LITTLE... SLOWER.

11:13.914 --> 11:15.191
- ALL RIGHT.

11:15.226 --> 11:16.158
YEAH.

BACK AT HOME,

11:33.106 --> 11:35.384
OR WOULD YOU LIKE TO GO
TO THE SUPERMARKET?

11:35.418 --> 11:37.524
- SUPERMARKET. WHY?

11:37.558 --> 11:39.215
- TO GET YOUR DEPOSIT BACK.

11:42.253 --> 11:45.083
- THAT'S NOT THAT FUNNY, DRIVER.

11:49.639 --> 11:52.194

13:44.478 --> 13:46.284
I TALKED TO THIS ONE GIRL
FOR, LIKE, AN HOUR AND A HALF.

13:46.308 --> 13:48.103
WHO'S YOUR DATE WITH?

13:48.137 --> 13:49.701

13:53.660 --> 13:54.626
- OH, GOD, DON'T DO THIS.

13:54.661 --> 13:56.145
- DID YOU ASK HIM OUT?

13:56.180 --> 13:57.329
- OH, MY GOD,
YOU HAVEN'T CHANGED AT ALL.

13:57.353 --> 13:58.320

13:58.354 --> 14:00.770

14:21.930 --> 14:23.552
- REALLY?
THE KIDS THING SCARES YOU?

14:23.586 --> 14:24.978
- YOU HAVE EIGHT BROTHERS
AND SISTERS.

14:25.002 --> 14:26.462
WHEN YOU SAY "KIDS,"
IT MAKES ME THINK ABOUT

14:26.486 --> 14:28.050
LIVING WITH THE ENTIRE
CUBS PITCHING STAFF.

14:28.074 --> 14:30.179
- WITH ONE MAJOR DIFFERENCE.

14:30.214 --> 14:31.734
MY KIDS COULD HOLD A LEAD
IN THE NINTH.

14:36.358 --> 14:39.913
SEE, THAT'S WHY I LOVE YOU.

15:45.634 --> 15:47.118

16:02.478 --> 16:03.928
- BRIAN'S NEVER
GONNA GO FOR THAT.

16:03.963 --> 16:05.492
- WHY NOT?
- BECAUSE UNLIKE YOU MISCREANTS,

16:05.516 --> 16:08.484
HE'S A DECENT, MORAL,
CIVILIZED HUMAN BEING,

16:08.519 --> 16:10.590

16:25.536 --> 16:27.572
- A '94 SUBARU, BRIAN.

16:27.607 --> 16:29.343
COULD'VE HITCHED A RIDE

AND GOT THERE FASTER.

16:30.679 --> 16:32.336

16:43.864 --> 16:45.625
- THIS IS NOT A SHAKE,
THIS IS A SHIMMY.

16:45.659 --> 16:48.697
HEY, HOW AWESOME
IS MICHAEL PHELPS, GUYS?

16:48.731 --> 16:50.768
- GOD, ALL HE'S WEARING
IS A SPEEDO NOW.

16:50.802 --> 16:52.701
- THIS AIN'T GONNA WORK.

16:52.735 --> 16:54.644
IF THEY HEAD OUT THAT RESTAURANT
HEADING BACK TO HIS PLACE,

16:54.668 --> 16:56.060
THE ONLY WAY WE'RE KEEPING UP IS
IF THEY'RE RIDING ON A BICYCLE.

16:56.084 --> 16:57.268
- SHE'S NOT GOING
BACK TO HIS PLACE.

16:57.292 --> 16:58.707
- WHAT HE LOOK LIKE?

16:58.741 --> 17:01.606
- SHE SAID HE LOOKED
LIKE, UH, MATT DAMON.

17:01.641 --> 17:04.299
- WE'RE GONNA NEED A FASTER CAR.
- GOD.

17:04.333 --> 17:07.060
- DUDE'S FREAKING TAKING HER
TO DAUPHINEA?

17:07.095 --> 17:09.166
THEY SERVE
A CHOCOLATE GALETTE HERE

17:09.200 --> 17:10.822
DRIZZLED IN LIQUID GOLD.

17:10.857 --> 17:12.479
YOU SURE IT'S NOT
THE REAL MATT DAMON?

17:12.514 --> 17:14.078
- WHAT'S A GALETTE?
- IT'S LIKE A PUDDING.

17:14.102 --> 17:15.448
- IT'S A CAKE.

17:15.482 --> 17:17.898
A FLAT, FREE-FORM,
EXPENSIVE GODDAMN CAKE.

17:17.933 --> 17:20.867
I'M TELLING YOU RIGHT NOW, SHE'S
SLEEPING WITH THIS DUDE TONIGHT.

17:20.901 --> 17:22.696
THIS THE KIND OF PLACE
YOU TAKE A CHICK IN,

17:22.731 --> 17:24.146
LET HER SMELL A NAPKIN,

17:24.181 --> 17:25.537
SHE'LL BLOW YOU
RIGHT THERE AT THE TABLE.

17:25.561 --> 17:27.022
SHE MIGHT BE BLOWING
THE GUY RIGHT NOW,

17:27.046 --> 17:28.092
BETWEEN THE APPETIZER
AND THE MAIN COURSE.

17:28.116 --> 17:29.082
I KNOW I WOULD.

17:29.117 --> 17:30.394
- BRIAN, STOP.

17:30.428 --> 17:31.395
- YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
HELPING ME.

17:31.429 --> 17:32.475
- I AM HELPING YOU, BROTHER.

17:32.499 --> 17:33.638
I'M TELLING YOU THE TRUTH.

17:33.673 --> 17:35.399
NONE OF THIS WOULD'VE HAPPENED

17:35.433 --> 17:36.365
IF YOU HAD PAID THE RIGHT
KIND OF ATTENTION TO HER

17:36.400 --> 17:37.746
INSTEAD OF
LAYING AROUND THE HOUSE

17:37.780 --> 17:39.506
PLAYING MADDEN
ON THE XBOX ALL DAY.

17:39.541 --> 17:41.001
BRIAN, STOP IT.
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

17:41.025 --> 17:43.510
YOU WERE WITH ME HALF THE TIME,
PLAYING XBOX.

17:43.545 --> 17:46.341
- SO I COULD SABOTAGE MY
RELATIONSHIP WITH JEFF THE CHEF.

17:46.375 --> 17:48.343
I HAD A MASTER PLAN.
I KNEW WHAT I WAS DOING.

17:48.377 --> 17:50.517
- IF YOU EAT GOLD,
DOES THAT MEAN YOU SH... GOLD?

17:50.552 --> 17:51.863
BRIAN, SHUT UP.

17:51.898 --> 17:53.486
WHY ARE YOU TAKING IT OUT
ON BRIAN?

17:53.520 --> 17:55.557
- I'M NOT TAKING IT OUT ON BRI...
YOU STARTED THIS.

17:55.591 --> 17:58.007
- MAYBE THAT'S WHAT THEY MEAN
BY "SH... TING BRICKS."

17:58.042 --> 17:59.595
I SWEAR TO GOD, BUDDY.

17:59.630 --> 18:01.332
HEY, YOU STARTED THIS
BY NOT LISTENING TO YOUR CHICK.

18:01.356 --> 18:03.392
AND NOW SHE'S GIVING HUMMERS
TO MOVIE STARS

18:03.427 --> 18:05.784
IN PLACES WHERE THEY WON'T LET
YOU DO THE HEIMLICH MANEUVER IN.

18:05.808 --> 18:07.845
YOU HAPPY?
- OH, MY GOD.

18:07.879 --> 18:09.743
- WHAT?
- IS THAT THE GUY?

18:09.778 --> 18:12.436
- OH, MY GOD.
- OH.

18:12.470 --> 18:15.887
I WOULD CONSIDER
HAVING ORAL SEX WITH THAT MAN.

18:15.922 --> 18:18.683
- MY GIRLFRIEND'S GONNA
HAVE SEX WITH JASON BOURNE.

18:18.718 --> 18:21.100
- SHE'S LOOKING THIS WAY!
- OH!

18:21.134 --> 18:24.793
- DID YOU SEE THAT NEW JASON
BOURNE MOVIE WITH JEREMY RENNER

18:24.827 --> 18:27.623
WHERE IT'S LIKE
HE'S NOT JASON BOURNE,

18:27.658 --> 18:32.145
BUT THERE'S A WHOLE PROGRAM?

18:32.180 --> 18:34.423
I DIDN'T THINK THAT YOU HAD.

18:34.458 --> 18:36.563
- THIS IS SO BAD.
THIS IS SO BAD.

18:36.598 --> 18:37.816
DID I TELL YOU THAT SHE
SH... CANNED ME AS HER I.C.E.

18:37.840 --> 18:39.601
AND PUT IN HER SISTER?

18:39.635 --> 18:41.775
- SHE DESPISES HER SISTER.
- I KNOW.

18:41.810 --> 18:43.708
- WHAT THE HELL ARE WE
EVEN DOING HERE?

18:43.743 --> 18:46.159
YOU SHOULD'VE MENTIONED THAT
UP FRONT. IT'S OVER, MAN.

18:46.194 --> 18:47.816
HER USING HER SISTER
AS HER I.C.E.

18:47.850 --> 18:51.475
IS LIKE ME USING
ANN GODDAMN COULTER.

18:51.509 --> 18:53.373
OH, MY GOD.
Both: OH.

18:53.408 --> 18:55.064
- WOW.

18:55.099 --> 18:58.102
- THE GUY DRIVES A LAMBORGHINI?
- LORD, PLEASE.

18:58.137 --> 19:00.069
PLEASE, LORD, DON'T LET HER
SLEEP WITH THIS GUY.

19:00.104 --> 19:02.186
- PLEASE, LORD, IF YOU CAN
HEAR ME, LET THIS GUY BE GAY.

19:02.210 --> 19:03.625
- HEY, THEY'RE MAKING OUT.

19:03.659 --> 19:05.282
- OKAY, FORGET GAY.
LET HIM BE BI.

19:05.316 --> 19:08.181
- SHE'S PUSHING HIM AWAY.
- MM.

19:08.216 --> 19:09.458
WAIT, IS SHE...

19:09.493 --> 19:10.908
- YEAH,
SHE'S GIVING HIM A TICKET.

19:10.942 --> 19:12.910
- MUST HAVE BEEN
A TERRIBLE KISS.

19:12.944 --> 19:14.291
- BRIAN.
- I KNOW. I'LL STOP.

19:14.325 --> 19:17.017
OH, HEY!

19:17.052 --> 19:19.088
SHE'S WALKING AWAY.
- YEAH! OF COURSE SHE IS.

19:19.123 --> 19:20.825
SEE, 'CAUSE SHE'S TOO SMART
TO FALL FOR AMERICAN PSYCHO...

19:20.849 --> 19:22.264
- HEY!
- HI.

19:22.299 --> 19:25.440
- HI, THERESA.
- WHY DO YOU SMELL LIKE PEACHES?

19:25.474 --> 19:28.305
- 'CAUSE I'M DRUNK.
OH, YOU LOOK SO PRETTY.

19:28.339 --> 19:30.238
- DID YOU JUST
GIVE THAT GUY A TICKET?

19:30.272 --> 19:32.999
- YES.
HIS REGISTRATION WAS EXPIRED.

19:33.033 --> 19:35.450
WHICH I'D NORMALLY LET GO
WHEN ON A DATE WITH SUCH

19:35.484 --> 19:38.453
AN INCREDIBLY HANDSOME, SEXY,
SHOCKINGLY WEALTHY DUDE,

19:38.487 --> 19:40.144
EXCEPT FOR TWO THINGS:

19:40.179 --> 19:42.698
NUMBER ONE, HE WOULDN'T
STOP TALKING ABOUT HIMSELF.

19:42.733 --> 19:45.460
HE WAS A COCKY, ARROGANT,
SELF-INVOLVED ASSHOLE,

19:45.494 --> 19:48.048
WHICH APPARENTLY
I SEEM TO BE ATTRACTED TO.

19:48.083 --> 19:49.716
SO I WAS STILL GONNA
LET HIM MAKE OUT WITH ME

19:49.740 --> 19:53.122
RIGHT THERE IN THE CAR
FOR HOPEFULLY ABOUT 15 MINUTES.

19:53.157 --> 19:54.710
- BECAUSE HE DRIVES
A LAMBORGHINI?

19:54.745 --> 19:56.298
- THAT AND THE FACT
THAT I KNEW

19:56.333 --> 19:57.817
YOU GUYS WERE OUT HERE
WATCHING ME.

19:57.851 --> 19:59.508
HOW?

19:59.543 --> 20:01.452
- BECAUSE I GPS'D YOUR PHONE
ABOUT TWO MONTHS AGO.

20:01.476 --> 20:03.788
All: OH.

20:03.823 --> 20:05.204
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

20:05.238 --> 20:07.275
I SHOULD NEVER HAVE
DELETED YOU AS MY I.C.E.

20:07.309 --> 20:09.449
BECAUSE WHO BETTER TO CALL

20:09.484 --> 20:11.037
IN CASE OF EMERGENCY
THAN SOMEONE

20:11.071 --> 20:13.488
WHO IS ALREADY PARKED
RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET?

20:13.522 --> 20:16.145
MY GOD, JOHNNY.

20:16.180 --> 20:18.665
IF ONLY YOU WOULD PUT
THIS MUCH THOUGHT AND ENERGY

20:18.700 --> 20:20.529
INTO OUR RELATIONSHIP.

20:20.564 --> 20:22.704
IT COULD'VE ENDED WITH US
WALKING HOME TONIGHT

20:22.738 --> 20:25.051
ARM IN ARM, TOTALLY IN LOVE.

20:25.085 --> 20:29.262
INSTEAD, I'LL BE TAKING A TAXI
BY MYSELF.

20:29.297 --> 20:30.850
GOOD NIGHT, GENTLEMEN.

20:30.884 --> 20:32.334
JOHNNY.

20:37.270 --> 20:41.550
- WELL, WHO'S GLAD WE CAME?

20:43.000 --> 20:45.071
- WASH 'EM DOWN QUICK,
PEACH FUZZ.

20:45.105 --> 20:46.807
HANK'S GOT THE RIG LOADED
AND READY TO ROLL.

20:46.831 --> 20:48.143
HE'S FUELING IT UP
AS WE SPEAK.

20:48.177 --> 20:49.524
ALL JOBS THE NEW KID...

20:49.558 --> 20:51.042
IS SUPPOSED TO DO...

20:51.077 --> 20:52.458
EVEN WITH...

20:52.492 --> 20:54.080
A MASSIVE HANGOVER.

20:54.114 --> 20:56.300
- BEST CURE I KNOW FOR A
HANGOVER IS JUMPING IN THE LAKE.

20:56.324 --> 20:58.326
NAKED.
- MM.

21:01.708 --> 21:04.746
- I NEED SOMETHING TO DRINK.
SOMETHING WITHOUT ALCOHOL.

21:04.780 --> 21:07.058
- HERE.

21:07.093 --> 21:08.474
- I THINK I'M OFF PEACHES.

21:08.508 --> 21:10.821
AND BARS.
AND SWIMMING.

21:10.855 --> 21:12.512
- I'M SORRY FOR PUTTING YOU

21:12.547 --> 21:13.903
IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE WHOLE THERESA THING,

21:13.927 --> 21:16.275
EASTER SEAL,
IT WAS UNFAIR AND IRRESPONSIBLE.

21:16.309 --> 21:17.724
- NO, THAT PART WAS AWESOME.

21:17.759 --> 21:19.554
I'VE NEVER BEEN
ON A SPY MISSION BEFORE.

21:19.588 --> 21:21.556
- YEAH?

21:21.590 --> 21:22.522
WELL, IN THAT CASE, YOU CAN
JOIN US TONIGHT IF YOU WANT.

21:22.557 --> 21:24.213
SHE'S GOT ANOTHER DATE.

21:24.248 --> 21:25.915
BUT SHE UN-GPS'D HER PHONE,
SO WE NEED TO RENT A CAR

21:25.939 --> 21:27.538
AND BE OUT IN FRONT OF HER
APARTMENT BY 6:00 TO FOLLOW HER

21:27.562 --> 21:29.091
AND WHOEVER THE HELL'S
COMING TO PICK HER UP,

21:29.115 --> 21:32.705
WHICH I'M PRETTY SURE
IS GONNA BE DENZEL.

21:32.739 --> 21:34.258
WHAT?

21:34.293 --> 21:36.743
- DRUNK AS I WAS,
I CLEARLY RECALL THERESA SAYING

21:36.778 --> 21:38.952
THAT SHE WANTED TO SEE
SOME NEW BEHAVIOR FROM YOU.

21:38.987 --> 21:40.713
- WHAT'D I SAY?
NO PHONE. RENTAL CAR.

21:40.747 --> 21:44.406
- THOSE ARE NOT NEW.

21:44.441 --> 21:45.442
THIS SODA TASTES FUNNY.

21:45.476 --> 21:46.753
- REALLY?
- IT SHOULD.

21:46.788 --> 21:48.548
- SEEING AS HOW
THE BOTTLE IT'S IN

21:48.583 --> 21:51.482
SPENT MOST OF YESTERDAY
UP SOME FAT GUY'S ASS.

21:56.384 --> 21:57.626
I SWALLOWED IT.

21:57.661 --> 21:58.903
AAH!

21:58.938 --> 22:01.596
NO! NO!

22:01.630 --> 22:03.322
- SECOND BEST CURE
FOR A HANGOVER.

22:05.841 --> 22:07.084
- WHAT AN A-HOLE.

22:07.118 --> 22:09.086
- I...
HEY.

22:09.120 --> 22:11.916
- DID HE DRINK IT?
- ALMOST THE WHOLE BOTTLE.

22:11.951 --> 22:13.584
- I TAKE IT YOU DIDN'T TELL HIM
IT WASN'T THE ACTUAL BOTTLE YET.

22:13.608 --> 22:14.930
- NO, I WAS GONNA
WAIT A LITTLE WHILE FOR THAT.

22:14.954 --> 22:15.817
LIKE, MAYBE A MONTH.

22:15.851 --> 22:16.990
- AH.

22:17.025 --> 22:18.371
- I'LL SEE YOU IN FIVE.

22:18.406 --> 22:20.408
- SEE YOU IN A BIT.

22:26.966 --> 22:34.966
♪
