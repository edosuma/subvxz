[DOORBELL CHIMES]

00:13.491 --> 00:15.163
- Niles.
- I'm sorry to drop by unannounced,

00:15.331 --> 00:17.003
- but I need your help.
- Of course. Sherry?

00:17.171 --> 00:20.243
Please. As you know, ever since
I moved into The Montana,

00:20.411 --> 00:22.402
I've been angling to meet
our most famous tenant,

00:22.571 --> 00:24.766
EsmÃ« Bing, the walnut queen.

00:24.931 --> 00:28.970
Well, I finally cornered her in the
ornamental garden by the wishing well,

00:29.131 --> 00:30.723
and I felt very pleased with myself.

00:30.891 --> 00:34.645
That is, until the walnut queen invited
me to a ball. Now I have a problem.

00:34.811 --> 00:37.530
Yes, your life has become
an operetta.

00:38.571 --> 00:40.641
No, it's a charity ball.

00:40.811 --> 00:43.530
And when I say "invited," I mean
she let me buy a table for ten

00:43.691 --> 00:45.807
- at $5000.
- Oh, no.

00:45.971 --> 00:48.565
I have until Sunday to sell eight
$500 tickets.

00:48.731 --> 00:50.210
- Say no more.
- Oh.

00:50.371 --> 00:53.169
- It's a bit steep, but if it's for charity...
- Thanks, Frasier.

00:53.331 --> 00:55.845
- It is a very worthy cause.
- All right.

00:56.011 --> 01:00.448
- Well, who should I make this out to?
- To the Esmerelda...

01:00.891 --> 01:02.847
...Bing...

01:03.011 --> 01:04.683
...lnternational...
- Right.

01:05.131 --> 01:07.167
...Doll Museum.

01:09.371 --> 01:11.805
You do have a problem.

01:12.011 --> 01:13.285
I thought you prided yourself

01:13.451 --> 01:16.966
- on supporting the arts.
- The arts, Niles. Not the crafts.

01:17.131 --> 01:19.691
I told you, I can't do it now.
Sherry's taking me out

01:19.851 --> 01:23.161
for our third-month anniversary,
and I gotta get a new sport coat.

01:23.331 --> 01:26.084
You cannot skip your exercises again.
You skipped them yesterday.

01:26.251 --> 01:28.321
This is the only time Sherry
can go shopping with me.

01:28.491 --> 01:31.563
And I can't go without her. There isn't
a woman alive with her fashion sense.

01:31.731 --> 01:34.848
Carmen Miranda having passed on.

01:35.011 --> 01:36.524
I should think having a lady friend

01:36.691 --> 01:38.921
would make you exercise more,
not less.

01:39.091 --> 01:41.605
I don't mean to be indelicate,
but a man in your condition

01:41.771 --> 01:44.331
who wants to enjoy certain,
shall we say, indoor sports

01:44.491 --> 01:47.403
should take steps to
make sure that cranky old Mr Hip

01:47.571 --> 01:51.007
doesn't, shall we say, let down
the team, if you get my meaning.

01:51.171 --> 01:52.365
Oh, don't you worry about me.

01:52.531 --> 01:54.249
I may not be rookie of the year
anymore,

01:54.411 --> 01:56.288
but I can still move around the bases.

01:56.451 --> 01:59.488
- Oh, hey, Martin.
- Oh, look, a scout from the majors.

01:59.691 --> 02:01.522
- See you later. Gotta run.
ROZ: Okay, bye.

02:01.691 --> 02:04.922
- Well, Roz, this is a surprise.
- Big news.

02:05.091 --> 02:08.526
<i>- Gertie Olsen's leaving the station.
- What, from Gertie's Grab Bag?</i>

02:08.691 --> 02:10.408
- I love that show.
FRAZIER: Oh, please.

02:10.571 --> 02:12.129
That homily-spouting hausfrau

02:12.291 --> 02:14.088
is the most embarrassing thing
on the air.

02:14.251 --> 02:18.449
- So she finally got canned, eh?
- No, she got a million-dollar TV deal.

02:22.051 --> 02:25.009
Good news for Gertie,
and for the many atheists

02:25.171 --> 02:27.526
who will welcome this new proof
of their theory.

02:27.691 --> 02:33.448
Well, anyway, they're auditioning
people for her time slot, and...

02:33.611 --> 02:34.930
I'm gonna go for it.

02:35.331 --> 02:37.401
What do you mean, your own show?

02:37.611 --> 02:39.602
Oh, Roz, that's exciting.

02:39.771 --> 02:42.729
And what better way to celebrate
an exciting new career move,

02:42.891 --> 02:45.644
than spending this Sunday
at a swanky society ball.

02:45.811 --> 02:47.005
Oh, drop it, Niles!

02:48.571 --> 02:51.005
Roz, I must say,
this comes as bit of a surprise.

02:51.171 --> 02:53.446
DAPHNE: I never knew
you wanted your own show.

02:53.611 --> 02:55.567
Well, it's the whole reason
I got into radio.

02:55.731 --> 02:58.529
I had my own show in college, and
when I started working at the station,

02:58.691 --> 03:00.682
I just sort of got stuck
on the producing side.

03:00.851 --> 03:03.081
Well, what kind of show
did you have in mind?

03:03.491 --> 03:07.450
I thought I'd talk about stuff I know.
You know, the singles' life in Seattle.

03:07.611 --> 03:10.364
Dating, fashion,
where to meet available men.

03:10.531 --> 03:13.204
If you're looking for an event
that'll be crawling with single men,

03:13.371 --> 03:15.839
- this particular gala should be just...
- Niles!

03:16.971 --> 03:20.407
Anyway, Frasier, I hope
you'll support me on this.

03:20.731 --> 03:24.644
Well... I hate to lose you,
but of course I'll support you.

03:24.811 --> 03:27.279
Thank you, Frasier. You're the best.

03:27.451 --> 03:28.804
- Well...
- Well, listen,

03:28.971 --> 03:31.804
as long as I've got you all here,
I'm putting together a tape,

03:31.971 --> 03:34.166
and I could use people
to pretend to be callers.

03:34.331 --> 03:36.083
FRAZIER: We'd be glad.
- Sounds like fun.

03:36.251 --> 03:38.287
- I'll come back tonight.
FRAZIER: All right.

03:38.451 --> 03:40.806
And, Daphne, I need
at least one spicy call.

03:40.971 --> 03:44.680
Could you pretend to be a woman
who doesn't believe in sex without love,

03:44.851 --> 03:48.241
but just feels so horny sometimes
she wants to jump anything in pants?

03:48.411 --> 03:50.879
Well, I'll try.

03:51.051 --> 03:54.407
And while I'm at it, I'll see if
I can fake a British accent.

04:01.811 --> 04:04.928
<i>ROZ: Good afternoon, Seattle. I'm
Roz Doyle, and this is Love Matters.</i>

04:05.091 --> 04:09.607
Today we're chatting with merchant
seaman Steve Baron from Bellingham.

04:10.451 --> 04:13.329
Tell me, Steve, what do you look
for in an ideal date?

04:14.331 --> 04:19.245
When my shipmates and I put into port
after several weeks at sea...

04:19.411 --> 04:20.810
Cut.

04:22.331 --> 04:24.970
I'm sorry, Frasier, but you don't
sound like a merchant seaman.

04:25.131 --> 04:27.645
Point well taken.
Let's try again. All right.

04:27.811 --> 04:30.803
So, Steve, what do you look
for in an ideal date?

04:31.371 --> 04:33.521
When my shipmates and I...

04:36.451 --> 04:41.002
...put into port after several weeks
at sea, the first thing we do is...

04:41.171 --> 04:44.163
Head for the antique sales.

04:44.651 --> 04:47.006
Fine, smarty pants.
You play Steve then.

04:47.171 --> 04:50.846
No. Never mind. Let's just go on
to my next idea. Daphne?

04:51.011 --> 04:53.366
Okay, you be the girlfriend
in a couple

04:53.531 --> 04:55.408
who wants to spice things up
in the bedroom.

04:55.571 --> 04:57.926
- Niles, will you be her boyfriend?
- Yes.

05:02.451 --> 05:05.011
Okay. I'm here with Fred and Patty.

05:05.171 --> 05:07.082
Tell me, you two,
what made you think

05:07.251 --> 05:09.207
that your sex life needed
a little jump-start?

05:10.891 --> 05:13.166
It's all his fault.

05:13.331 --> 05:15.720
He just seems
to have lost interest in me.

05:15.891 --> 05:19.361
I've done everything I can
to entice him. I've...

05:19.531 --> 05:23.001
I've served dinner wearing nothing
but high heels and an apron.

05:25.171 --> 05:27.731
I've called him at the office
and talked dirty.

05:29.051 --> 05:31.963
And last night when he came home,
I was lying in bed

05:32.131 --> 05:34.929
wearing a whipped-cream teddy.

05:35.971 --> 05:38.769
But did he care? No!

05:38.931 --> 05:40.887
And none of this turned you on, Fred?

05:42.000 --> 05:48.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:49.491 --> 05:51.049
Fred?

05:51.571 --> 05:54.369
That's nothing. You should hear
the other things that didn't turn me on.

05:54.531 --> 05:56.522
Tell me about them, Patty.

05:57.331 --> 05:59.481
Let's cut to the chase.

05:59.651 --> 06:01.004
Patty, men are like fish.

06:01.251 --> 06:03.811
When you first hook them,
they wriggle around like crazy.

06:03.971 --> 06:07.884
But once you finally reel them in,
they just lie there with that glassy look.

06:08.571 --> 06:11.210
- I'd throw this one back.
- That's terrible advice.

06:11.371 --> 06:12.486
- No, it isn't.
- Yes, it is.

06:12.651 --> 06:14.960
You have no idea how Fred
really feels about Daphne... Patsy.

06:15.131 --> 06:17.326
- Patty.
- Patty.

06:17.971 --> 06:20.531
- This is pointless.
- No, Roz, you were doing just fine.

06:20.691 --> 06:25.481
No, I was terrible. I wasn't helpful.
I wasn't smart. I wasn't even sassy.

06:25.651 --> 06:28.324
Well, well, perhaps not sassy,
but you were certainly saucy.

06:28.491 --> 06:31.130
That borders on sassy. Roz!

06:33.051 --> 06:35.406
Hello, Mr Crane. How was
your romantic evening with Sherry?

06:35.571 --> 06:39.120
Oh, it was fine. Fine. Yeah. Yeah.

06:39.491 --> 06:42.210
Hey, Daph, how about getting
that exercise mat out?

06:42.371 --> 06:44.646
We'll do some stretches, huh? Ah.

06:45.171 --> 06:47.605
Can't right now. I'm helping Roz
with her audition tape.

06:47.771 --> 06:49.841
MARTIN:
Well, how long's it gonna take?

06:50.011 --> 06:52.366
What are you so eager for?

06:52.531 --> 06:54.761
Oh, I get the picture.

06:55.131 --> 06:58.203
Not too limber with Sherry
this evening, were we?

06:58.371 --> 07:01.204
Two hips but no hooray?

07:01.811 --> 07:04.484
Very funny. Well, you haven't exactly
been burning it up

07:04.651 --> 07:06.004
in the romance department either.

07:06.171 --> 07:08.082
What do you know about my love life?

07:08.251 --> 07:09.969
<i>DAPHNE [ON RECORDER]:
I was lying in bed</i>

07:10.131 --> 07:12.281
<i>wearing a whipped-cream teddy.</i>

07:12.451 --> 07:14.567
<i>But did he care?</i>

07:17.411 --> 07:19.720
It takes a little time
to get the hang of it at first.

07:19.891 --> 07:21.643
My God, you should've heard
my audition tape.

07:21.811 --> 07:24.279
- I was so inept it was incredible.
- That's true.

07:24.451 --> 07:26.521
Well... Oh, you mean...
Well, you heard it.

07:26.691 --> 07:28.443
All right, then you see
what perseverance...

07:28.611 --> 07:31.079
There was a bootleg copy floating
around the station for months.

07:31.251 --> 07:32.969
Yes, well, fine.
So you get my point then.

07:33.131 --> 07:36.043
- Yeah, people still play it at parties.
- Well, all right, Roz!

07:36.891 --> 07:39.121
Hey, Roz, I hear you're
trying out for a new job.

07:39.291 --> 07:43.079
Yes, as a matter of fact, I am. And you
could really help me with my demo.

07:43.251 --> 07:45.242
- What do I do?
- I just want an honest answer.

07:45.411 --> 07:47.481
- I want to talk to you about first dates.
- Okay.

07:47.651 --> 07:50.768
Are you sure Dad's the best candidate
for this particular subject?

07:50.931 --> 07:54.924
Quick survey. How many Crane men
here with a girlfriend?

07:56.571 --> 07:58.926
No, no. Keep them up while I count.

07:59.211 --> 08:00.530
All right, here.

08:00.691 --> 08:02.283
- Sure, I'll help you.
ROZ: Great.

08:02.451 --> 08:05.807
- Okay, Frasier...
FRAZIER: Just a minute. Here we are.

08:05.971 --> 08:08.610
ROZ: Start the tape.
FRAZIER: Yes.

08:08.771 --> 08:11.569
ROZ: We're here with Martin,
and we're talking about first dates.

08:11.731 --> 08:15.280
Martin, tell me some of the tricks
you use to impress women.

08:15.491 --> 08:20.042
Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you, Roz,
but I really don't know any tricks.

08:20.211 --> 08:23.567
I mean, if a woman agrees
to go out with me, I'd...

08:23.731 --> 08:26.484
Well, I'm not there to impress her
or to play cool.

08:26.651 --> 08:29.961
I'm there because I want to know her.
You know, what she thinks,

08:30.131 --> 08:34.283
what she likes. So that if I'm lucky
enough to get another date,

08:34.451 --> 08:36.681
I can plan something
that I know she'd like to do.

08:37.251 --> 08:40.083
I guess I'm still old-fashioned
or something,

08:40.251 --> 08:42.811
but I think you should treat
a woman like a queen.

08:47.211 --> 08:50.601
Bow to the master, boys.
Bow to the master.

08:52.771 --> 08:54.762
- Hey, Bebe!
- Bulldog Briscoe,

08:54.931 --> 08:57.001
my absolute favourite client!

08:57.171 --> 08:59.002
Hello, Bebe.

08:59.171 --> 09:03.244
And Frasier Crane!
Alert the judges, we have a tie!

09:04.571 --> 09:07.643
Hello. Oh, my goodness, what a flock.
These all yours?

09:07.811 --> 09:10.041
Yes. The minute I heard
about the auditions,

09:10.211 --> 09:13.203
I piled all my hottest new discoveries
into the van.

09:13.531 --> 09:15.362
- You brought them in a van?
- I call it

09:15.531 --> 09:17.999
my Bebe's Stars of Tomorrow Tour.

09:18.691 --> 09:21.159
People, I want you to meet
Frasier Crane.

09:21.331 --> 09:22.923
FRAZIER: Hello.
- The caringest client

09:23.091 --> 09:24.365
- an agent ever had.
- Well...

09:24.531 --> 09:28.604
Frasier, this is Professor Pete,
the human encyclopaedia.

09:28.771 --> 09:31.569
Ask him anything.
He can't be stumped.

09:31.731 --> 09:35.929
Well, all right. Explain Freud's
theory of the superego.

09:36.091 --> 09:41.006
Sigmund Freud, noted psychiatrist,
was born in Vienna.

09:43.011 --> 09:45.320
- But that's not what I asked.
- He believed dreams

09:45.491 --> 09:47.925
had secret meanings.

09:48.291 --> 09:50.361
He just pulls it out of the air.

09:51.531 --> 09:53.920
But if it's a raucous political debate
you want,

09:54.091 --> 09:56.559
meet newlyweds
Hank and Hannah Finch.

09:56.731 --> 09:59.120
- Hello, Hank.
- He's a right-wing Baptist preacher,

09:59.291 --> 10:02.408
she's a fun-loving bisexual.

10:03.291 --> 10:05.088
Conflicts? You bet!

10:05.891 --> 10:09.850
- Have you ever seen such talent?
- Well...

10:10.011 --> 10:11.888
God, they're pathetic.

10:12.051 --> 10:13.962
- Frasier, Frasier!
FRAZIER: Roz.

10:14.131 --> 10:17.328
- It went really well.
- Oh, God, I'm so happy for you.

10:17.491 --> 10:19.686
Do you know what he actually said?
At this moment,

10:19.851 --> 10:22.160
- I am the candidate to beat!
- Congratulations, Roz.

10:22.331 --> 10:23.684
- That's fabulous.
ROZ: Okay.

10:23.851 --> 10:25.728
- I'm gonna get set up for the show.
- Okay.

10:25.891 --> 10:28.246
- I'm so excited.
- Okay.

10:28.411 --> 10:30.561
Well, rah-rah for little Roz!

10:30.731 --> 10:33.325
Yes, well, I'm really thrilled
for her. I am.

10:33.811 --> 10:37.042
But God knows where I'm gonna find
another producer I feel so in sync with.

10:37.211 --> 10:40.044
You know, Hank Finch produced
hygiene films in the Army.

10:40.211 --> 10:43.089
No, no. Bebe, I don't think so.

10:44.131 --> 10:46.884
Oh, I'm not proud to admit this,
but there is a small part of me

10:47.051 --> 10:48.803
that hopes she doesn't get the job.

10:48.971 --> 10:50.484
God, I feel guilty just saying that.

10:50.651 --> 10:54.280
You're so good.
Everything makes you feel guilty.

10:54.451 --> 10:56.407
I'm so proud to represent you.

10:56.571 --> 10:59.529
You're like a modern-day
what's-his-name.

10:59.691 --> 11:02.728
Pete! Famous German doctor,
built a hospital in Africa.

11:02.891 --> 11:05.246
- Albert something?
- Hang on.

11:05.411 --> 11:08.642
- Schweitzer.
- No...

11:12.131 --> 11:13.689
And that's it for our show today.

11:13.851 --> 11:16.570
But before I sign off,
this final note to Karla,

11:16.731 --> 11:20.326
who called us early
from the planet Fripton.

11:22.051 --> 11:24.770
The technical term for your condition,
which eluded me earlier,

11:24.931 --> 11:28.321
is schizophreniform disorder.

11:28.491 --> 11:30.527
Or in layman's terms:

11:32.291 --> 11:35.840
God, you know once in a while,
it's nice to just call them as I see them.

11:36.011 --> 11:38.366
ROZ:
Hey, what's going on out here?

11:38.531 --> 11:40.761
FRAZIER: Oh, good Lord,
is it someone's birthday?

11:40.931 --> 11:42.728
I hate to be the one
to break it to you,

11:42.891 --> 11:44.847
but Brenda from the newsroom
got the job.

11:45.011 --> 11:47.047
- Brenda?
- Oh, Roz.

11:47.211 --> 11:50.009
It's total BS. Listen, if you
need a little comforting later...

11:50.171 --> 11:53.083
Hey, Brenda, all right! Wait up!
I'm there for you.

11:54.971 --> 11:58.850
- Roz, I'm so sorry.
- Oh, hell. I'll be okay.

11:59.451 --> 12:01.965
Guess I'd better go congratulate
the winner.

12:02.131 --> 12:03.689
Right.

12:05.451 --> 12:07.282
Bebe, did you hear
what happened to Roz?

12:07.451 --> 12:10.727
- Yes. No need to thank me, darling.
- What? What are you talking about?

12:10.891 --> 12:12.119
I spoke to the station manager.

12:12.291 --> 12:14.361
I told him just how you'd feel
if he gave Roz the job.

12:14.531 --> 12:16.999
You did what? Get in here!

12:17.171 --> 12:20.004
I said that Frasier Crane
wasn't about to work for a station

12:20.171 --> 12:22.207
- that would steal his producer away.
- Oh.

12:22.371 --> 12:25.204
A bluff, of course, but he crumbled
like a matzo.

12:25.371 --> 12:27.043
God, how could you?

12:27.531 --> 12:29.886
When I told you I'd hate to
lose Roz, I didn't mean for you

12:30.051 --> 12:33.760
- to sabotage her.
- You didn't?

12:34.051 --> 12:36.087
Oh, no.

12:36.251 --> 12:39.687
What a horrible
misunderstanding. Wink!

12:41.771 --> 12:43.204
I mean it.

12:43.371 --> 12:45.601
Oh, I see.

12:45.771 --> 12:48.604
So when you said in that
off-handed way that you hoped

12:48.771 --> 12:54.368
that Roz wouldn't get the job,
I totally misinterpreted you.

12:54.531 --> 12:57.728
- Wink!
- Will you stop winking!

12:58.691 --> 13:01.922
My God, I could never want
such a thing!

13:02.091 --> 13:04.764
God, maybe there's some way
I can still reverse this.

13:04.931 --> 13:07.650
Oh, that was fun. I got to watch
Brenda sign her new contract.

13:07.811 --> 13:10.006
Roz, I think what they did to you
is monstrous.

13:10.371 --> 13:12.566
I wish I could stay here
and console you,

13:12.731 --> 13:15.370
but my people are waiting
for me in the van.

13:16.051 --> 13:18.963
I hope someone cracked
a window.

13:20.451 --> 13:22.965
Listen, Roz, there's something
we need to talk about.

13:23.131 --> 13:25.122
Oh, Frasier, I know
what you're gonna say.

13:25.291 --> 13:27.930
That I tried my best.
That I deserved it.

13:28.091 --> 13:29.809
I'm fine with this, really.

13:30.131 --> 13:33.646
Yeah, I gave it a shot.
That's what counts.

13:33.811 --> 13:34.960
I didn't get it.

13:35.171 --> 13:36.968
[CRYING]
It's not like my life is over.

13:37.251 --> 13:39.811
Oh. Oh, no. Oh.

13:41.731 --> 13:45.201
Oh, look at me. I'm so busy
feeling sorry for myself

13:45.371 --> 13:47.202
I haven't even thanked you
for all your help.

13:47.371 --> 13:50.010
- That's not necessary.
- No, it is.

13:50.171 --> 13:51.763
Look how close you helped me get.

13:51.931 --> 13:54.286
It's because of you
that I was second choice.

13:54.451 --> 13:56.567
I can't argue with that.

13:56.731 --> 13:58.050
Come for a second.

13:58.211 --> 14:00.645
Listen, there's something
I need to confess to you.

14:00.811 --> 14:04.087
You know, as much as I hoped
that you'd get the job,

14:04.251 --> 14:09.609
there was a very small part of me,
a very selfish part, that...

14:09.771 --> 14:11.284
That hoped you wouldn't.

14:11.451 --> 14:14.966
Oh, that's not bad.
That's really kind of sweet.

14:15.371 --> 14:17.202
Well, I'm glad to hear you feel
that way because

14:17.371 --> 14:19.123
I happened to mention
those feelings to Bebe.

14:19.291 --> 14:23.045
- Bebe? You told Bebe?
- It was just in passing.

14:23.211 --> 14:25.202
Oh, great. She torpedoed me,
didn't she?

14:25.371 --> 14:27.407
Yes. She told Doug that I'd quit
if you got the job.

14:27.571 --> 14:29.687
- I don't believe this.
- I'm glad to see you're as mad

14:29.851 --> 14:31.170
- at her as I am!
- I'm mad at you!

14:31.331 --> 14:32.400
- Me?
- How could do that?

14:32.571 --> 14:35.131
It was just an off-hand remark.
How was I to know how she'd react?

14:35.291 --> 14:36.565
She's Bebe!

14:38.091 --> 14:39.809
If you had said
you liked my eyes,

14:39.971 --> 14:42.804
they would've been on your desk
tomorrow in a Tiffany box.

14:42.971 --> 14:44.689
Oh, God! Roz, I'm so sorry.

14:44.851 --> 14:47.206
Just tell me how I can make it up
to you. I promise I will.

14:47.491 --> 14:50.051
- You mean it?
- Yes. Anything. Just name it.

14:50.411 --> 14:52.845
- Fire Bebe.
- Will that...?

14:53.011 --> 14:55.764
Well... How many things...?

14:55.931 --> 14:57.762
Isn't there something else
you'd like?

14:58.251 --> 15:02.483
The only thing I wanted was that job.
And she took it away.

15:03.291 --> 15:05.566
I am not just suggesting
this for my sake.

15:05.731 --> 15:09.121
I'm suggesting it for yours.
She is your representative.

15:09.291 --> 15:12.601
When she goes out into the world
lying and twisting your words

15:12.771 --> 15:16.605
and stabbing people in the back,
it reflects badly on you.

15:18.571 --> 15:20.323
You're right, Roz.

15:20.531 --> 15:22.169
How can I consider myself
an ethical person

15:22.331 --> 15:25.960
when I have the princess of darkness
conducting my business for me?

15:26.131 --> 15:29.282
Well, that's it. I'm gonna have to fire
that conniving harpy.

15:29.531 --> 15:31.123
I'm very proud of you.

15:31.291 --> 15:33.486
I'm ashamed to think how long
I've turned a blind eye

15:33.651 --> 15:35.084
on her unscrupulous behaviour.

15:35.651 --> 15:37.607
And what for?

15:37.771 --> 15:41.559
Twenty-percent pay increase?
Six-week paid vacation.

15:41.731 --> 15:43.210
An expense account.
A travel allowance.

15:43.371 --> 15:46.647
- Frasier!
- Well, not anymore.

15:50.451 --> 15:55.002
VERA: Frasier Crane's here.
He's not alone. Have a seat.

15:57.331 --> 16:00.004
Frasier, Roz. My two favourite people.

16:00.171 --> 16:01.445
- Not for long.
- Bebe,

16:01.611 --> 16:03.522
we've got to discuss what
happened this morning.

16:03.691 --> 16:05.841
This time you won't wink
your way out of it.

16:06.011 --> 16:10.766
This sounds serious. You two come
right in, and we'll solve this thing.

16:10.931 --> 16:14.446
Let's just promise to be totally honest
with each other.

16:14.611 --> 16:17.364
We're losing one. Code red.

16:18.131 --> 16:20.884
What can I get you?
Champagne?

16:21.051 --> 16:22.564
ROZ: Nothing.
- A massage?

16:22.731 --> 16:25.006
- No, thank you.
BEBE: You're sure?

16:25.171 --> 16:26.843
Vladimir can be here
in five minutes.

16:27.011 --> 16:28.649
He will play your spine
like a Steinway.

16:28.811 --> 16:30.608
Can we just get started?

16:31.451 --> 16:36.400
Roz, I'm just a wreck
about our misunderstanding today.

16:36.571 --> 16:39.005
- Can you ever forgive me?
- No.

16:39.171 --> 16:42.163
Why should you?
I don't forgive myself.

16:42.331 --> 16:46.722
Bebe, what you did today was unfair,
not just to Roz, but to me.

16:47.971 --> 16:50.326
Thanks to you, a strain
has been put on our relationship,

16:50.491 --> 16:53.608
both professionally and personally.

16:53.771 --> 16:57.366
Now all of this I might be able to let go
had it been an isolated incident,

16:57.531 --> 17:00.967
but I've observed that it's just part
of a pattern... Are you quite all right?

17:01.611 --> 17:05.001
It's nothing. It's just
a silly little cardiac thing.

17:05.491 --> 17:08.449
Go, go! You're distracting my client,
and my clients come first.

17:08.611 --> 17:12.604
Oh, poor little Bebe. How many fake
pills do you have to take every day?

17:12.771 --> 17:15.079
Yes, did you really think you
could deceive us sitting there

17:15.251 --> 17:16.366
popping a bunch of...

17:16.531 --> 17:19.522
Digitalis? Oh, my God!
You really are sick!

17:19.691 --> 17:21.443
Well, of course I'm sick.

17:21.611 --> 17:24.967
But it makes me even sicker
to think that I've angered you

17:25.131 --> 17:28.123
when all I wanted to do was keep
the best damn team in radio together.

17:28.290 --> 17:30.759
Oh, God. We're gonna need
a shovel to get out of here.

17:30.931 --> 17:33.081
Yes, all right, Bebe.
Be that as it may, I still...

17:33.251 --> 17:34.320
[PHONE RINGS]

17:34.491 --> 17:37.403
I told you, no calls.

17:38.411 --> 17:40.367
What about my sister?

17:42.491 --> 17:44.322
One second.

17:45.091 --> 17:47.844
Did the air bag deploy?

17:50.251 --> 17:52.685
Look, I'm gonna have
to call you back.

17:52.851 --> 17:57.003
Frasier's here,
and my clients come first.

17:58.971 --> 18:01.405
I'm sorry. You were saying?

18:01.931 --> 18:04.809
Since the moment we met,
you have shown yourself to be

18:04.971 --> 18:06.962
ruthless and untrustworthy.

18:07.131 --> 18:10.168
As these are qualities I do not wish
to have associated with my name,

18:10.331 --> 18:11.480
It's best that we part...

18:11.651 --> 18:12.879
[PHONE RINGS]

18:13.051 --> 18:17.283
<i>- What did I say about calls?
LITTLE GIRL: Auntie Bebe?</i>

18:17.611 --> 18:20.569
Oh, Suzy.

18:21.851 --> 18:24.365
Sorry to hear about
your mummy's accident.

18:24.531 --> 18:27.045
<i>I'm frightened, Auntie Bebe.</i>

18:27.611 --> 18:29.567
Don't be, little one.

18:29.731 --> 18:35.010

will you take care of me?</i>

18:37.651 --> 18:43.965
Of course, my little lamb.
Assuming that I have the resources.

18:44.971 --> 18:46.609
Bebe, you know,
I can't help noticing

18:46.771 --> 18:48.682
that none of your outside lines
are lit up.

18:48.851 --> 18:52.082
The bulbs are broken.

18:55.531 --> 18:56.850
Auntie has to go.

18:57.011 --> 19:00.162
I'm with a client, and you know
what we say about clients.

19:00.331 --> 19:03.687
They always come first.

19:04.131 --> 19:08.124
- You are amazing.
- Is there nothing you won't stoop to?

19:08.731 --> 19:12.724
BEBE:
I had no idea who I was speaking to!

19:12.891 --> 19:15.007
How dare you impersonate my niece!

19:15.171 --> 19:18.720
I've had enough of your cruel jokes!
You're fired, Mother!

19:21.611 --> 19:23.249
- I just wanna say...
- No! Stop!

19:23.411 --> 19:25.720
Not one more crooked word!

19:25.891 --> 19:29.088
Your tongue could open a wine bottle!

19:31.251 --> 19:33.890
As of now, Frasier Crane
has resigned from your coven.

19:34.051 --> 19:37.407
Oh, that's it, is it?
I'm not virtuous enough for you?

19:37.571 --> 19:42.884
Not noble? Fine, quit! Next time you
need a deal made, call the Dalai Lama!

19:44.491 --> 19:48.325
A long time ago I had to make a choice
between being a good agent

19:48.491 --> 19:52.006
and a good person, because,
trust me, you can't be both!

19:52.171 --> 19:55.527
So forgive me if I don't have time to
make everybody feel warm and fuzzy.

19:55.691 --> 19:58.922
I am just too busy spending every
waking minute pulling any string,

19:59.091 --> 20:03.084
playing any shameless trick I can
to make my clients' dreams come true.

20:03.251 --> 20:06.049
I am a star maker!

20:06.531 --> 20:09.364
And if you can't appreciate that,
there are plenty who can.

20:09.811 --> 20:11.085
How about you?
You want an agent?

20:11.251 --> 20:12.889
- Oh, please!
- You mean it?

20:13.051 --> 20:14.928
FRAZIER:
Roz!

20:16.371 --> 20:18.805
I never had an agent.
It's not like she worships the devil.

20:18.971 --> 20:21.724
Well, she doesn't have to.
He worships her!

20:24.611 --> 20:27.683
You're absolutely right, Frasier.
Forget it, Bebe. No way.

20:27.851 --> 20:29.682
That voice. I could listen to it all day.

20:29.851 --> 20:32.888
It's pure, yet smouldering
like a nun with a past.

20:33.051 --> 20:35.201
- You think so?
- No, Roz, don't look her in the eye.

20:35.371 --> 20:38.204
I could triple your salary.
Voiceovers, commercials...

20:38.371 --> 20:40.202
Roz, listen to me. For God's sake,

20:40.371 --> 20:42.646
if you've got the tiniest shred
of sense or dignity left,

20:42.811 --> 20:45.564
remember what this woman did to you
this afternoon. And renounce her.

20:45.731 --> 20:49.644
She has no scruples. No ethics.
And no reflection!

20:52.531 --> 20:54.203
ROZ:
Let's get out of here.

20:54.371 --> 20:58.410
Well, nice doing business with you.
Wink!

21:00.131 --> 21:02.406
Oh, damn it. Frasier, I forgot my purse.

21:02.571 --> 21:04.448
- All right.
ROZ: Just be a minute.

21:04.851 --> 21:07.046
- Lunch tomorrow?
- 12:30. Bernardi's.
