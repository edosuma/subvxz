<i>Falling Skies...</i>

00:02.369 --> 00:04.075
Are you saying there's
a government in Charleston?

00:04.101 --> 00:06.695
Elected by almost 3,000
civilians in the new capital.

00:06.720 --> 00:08.256
We need to get back
in the war.

00:08.281 --> 00:10.767
Seems like Charleston might be
a good place to do that.

00:10.809 --> 00:12.007
You still in love
with her?

00:12.032 --> 00:13.705
No. Of course not.

00:14.693 --> 00:17.263
I know exactly what you'll do to
these people if you get the chance.

00:17.311 --> 00:19.169
Just gonna take off
without saying goodbye?

00:19.326 --> 00:21.093
When that Overlord
invaded my mind,

00:21.118 --> 00:22.969
he couldn't keep his thoughts
completely walled off.

00:23.220 --> 00:24.821
Come after me,
again and again.

00:24.846 --> 00:26.201
We're gonna keep rolling

00:26.226 --> 00:27.946
all the way to Charleston!

00:27.971 --> 00:29.207
This is the final push.

Wish me luck.

01:15.420 --> 01:17.422
It's gonna be okay.

01:19.094 --> 01:21.229
We'll see each other again.
I promise.

01:23.166 --> 01:24.366
I promise.

01:36.982 --> 01:39.418
How long
till we get there?

01:39.452 --> 01:42.922
It's hard to say.
Maybe about 300 more miles.

01:42.990 --> 01:44.857
How long will that take?

01:44.892 --> 01:48.362
Maybe 12 hours,
depending on the road conditions

01:48.396 --> 01:50.365
And if we have to take
any more detours.

01:50.399 --> 01:53.069
Any more detours,
and we'll run out of fuel.

01:53.103 --> 01:55.239
Maybe we should think about
scrounging up some more.

01:55.273 --> 01:56.607
Nope, no more side trips,

01:56.642 --> 01:59.011
Not with the aliens
riding on our tail.

01:59.045 --> 02:03.217
The sooner we get to Charleston,
the sooner we'll be safe.

02:03.251 --> 02:06.254
Dad, I want you
to keep this for me.

02:12.431 --> 02:14.633
Why would you write out
a will, Matt?

02:14.667 --> 02:18.171
Well, everyone's saying we're
not gonna make it to Charleston.

02:18.205 --> 02:19.473
And if I die, I want --

02:19.507 --> 02:20.975
You're not gonna die.

02:21.010 --> 02:22.314
And we're gonna make it
to Charleston.

02:22.315 --> 02:24.550
It's not a question of <i>if.</i>
It's a question of <i>when.</i>

02:25.851 --> 02:28.920
I want you to write that
in your journal.

02:28.954 --> 02:30.122
Okay.

02:30.156 --> 02:31.557
Okay?

02:31.592 --> 02:32.992
Yeah.

You need me to spell you?

03:09.908 --> 03:10.841
Nope.

03:10.875 --> 03:13.545
I'm good to go, boss.

03:13.579 --> 03:16.014
You call me "boss" one more
time, I'll slap you myself.

03:16.049 --> 03:18.751
Hey, I'm sorry
if I get on your nerves.

03:18.785 --> 03:20.186
Tell the truth,

03:20.220 --> 03:22.088
I'm surprised you picked me
to be your driver.

03:22.123 --> 03:23.891
Are you? Why's that?

03:25.594 --> 03:28.229
Well, I ain't exactly
the spit-and-polish type.

03:28.263 --> 03:29.998
Just what type are you,
Tector?

03:30.032 --> 03:31.933
That's what I'm trying
to figure out.

03:31.968 --> 03:33.235
Oh, yeah? Well, me too.

03:33.269 --> 03:34.937
Hey, you let me know

03:34.971 --> 03:37.640
If you come up with any
good theories there, Captain.

03:58.266 --> 03:59.734
How's it going, kids?

03:59.768 --> 04:01.135
Damn it, Pope.

04:01.169 --> 04:03.138
Next time you do that,
I'm gonna pop you in the nose.

04:03.172 --> 04:05.807
Yeah, well, then it'll just be
like old times, huh, Margaret?

04:05.842 --> 04:07.242
What do you want?

04:07.276 --> 04:11.580
Yeah, sometime soon, uh,
if we can make a pit stop.

04:11.615 --> 04:15.051
All this beer duty is starting
to take its toll on me.

04:15.085 --> 04:17.187
We only stop when
the tank's empty, all right?

04:17.221 --> 04:18.954
That's the rule.
You know that.

04:18.990 --> 04:22.626
What part of being an advance
scout don't you understand?

04:22.661 --> 04:23.961
Well, fine.

04:23.995 --> 04:27.165
I guess I'll just have to manage
on the fly.

04:27.200 --> 04:28.235
No peeking.

04:32.741 --> 04:34.709
Two days of this --
I'm gonna kill him.

04:34.743 --> 04:36.010
I truly am.

04:36.045 --> 04:37.579
Just give me the word.
I got your back.

04:39.148 --> 04:40.715
What?

04:40.750 --> 04:42.918
You wouldn't even.

04:42.952 --> 04:44.119
Kill Pope?

04:44.153 --> 04:45.954
I nearly have before
on a few occasions.

04:45.988 --> 04:47.355
But you didn't.

04:47.390 --> 04:49.591
What? You don't think
I have it in me?

04:49.625 --> 04:50.292
No.

04:52.061 --> 04:53.929
You don't have enough dark
in your soul.

04:53.963 --> 04:55.998
What does that mean?

04:56.032 --> 04:57.633
I can go dark.

04:57.668 --> 04:59.268
Yeah?
Yeah.

04:59.303 --> 05:02.206
What's the darkest thing
you've ever done?

05:04.742 --> 05:06.910
Well...

05:06.945 --> 05:08.879
Just as I suspected.

05:08.913 --> 05:09.880
I...

05:25.230 --> 05:27.364
Keep him hydrated.

05:29.334 --> 05:30.902
I-I can't.

05:30.969 --> 05:31.969
No.

05:34.239 --> 05:36.040
Son of a bitch.

05:36.074 --> 05:37.241
You okay?

05:37.309 --> 05:39.343
I got a blister.
It's just annoying.

05:39.378 --> 05:41.645
Want to see if I can
get this thing out of here,

05:41.680 --> 05:43.047
But it's in there
pretty good.

05:43.081 --> 05:45.316
When Uncle Scott built
something, he built it to last.

05:45.350 --> 05:46.918
I think these bolts
are rusted.

05:46.986 --> 05:48.719
Just leave it.

05:48.754 --> 05:50.354
The weight of one gurney's not
gonna make much of a difference.

05:50.389 --> 05:51.690
Let me look at it.

05:51.724 --> 05:53.224
No, it's fine.
I'm good.

05:53.259 --> 05:55.827
We still have
a long way to go.

05:55.861 --> 05:57.395
You sound worried.

05:57.430 --> 05:58.830
You're not?

05:58.865 --> 06:00.932
No. Rough stuff's
all behind us.

06:01.000 --> 06:03.001
It's all downhill
from here.

06:11.143 --> 06:12.443
Slow down a little.

06:12.478 --> 06:13.711
Okay, chief.

06:15.914 --> 06:17.315
Oh, what?
I can't call you "chief"?

06:17.349 --> 06:20.050
Boss. Chief.

06:20.084 --> 06:21.251
Why not "sir"?

06:21.285 --> 06:23.086
I'm not sure I follow.

06:23.120 --> 06:26.256
You work double time to come off
like a good, old country boy,

06:26.290 --> 06:28.225
But you handled
that sniper rifle

06:28.259 --> 06:30.694
like a soldier
who trained with the best --

06:30.728 --> 06:32.295
on an M24, maybe.

06:36.267 --> 06:37.934
Oh, yeah.

06:40.004 --> 06:42.072
So you <i>were</i> military.

06:42.106 --> 06:44.708
What I don't get
is why you're trying to hide it.

06:44.742 --> 06:47.744
Maybe you just want to kick up
your heels with the Berserkers.

06:47.779 --> 06:49.179
Is that it?

06:49.213 --> 06:51.281
You want to have the rest of us
do the heavy lifting,

06:51.315 --> 06:52.449
Is that it?

06:52.483 --> 06:54.084
What does it matter?

06:54.118 --> 06:56.787
I'll tell you how it matters,
soldier.

06:56.821 --> 06:58.255
You're serving under me,

06:58.290 --> 07:00.792
And I need to know
that I can trust you.

07:00.826 --> 07:04.095
And right now, I don't.

07:04.130 --> 07:05.197
I --

07:06.165 --> 07:07.999
Oh!

07:08.033 --> 07:10.401
Wow! What was that?
A deer?

07:10.436 --> 07:12.136
I'm not sure.

07:32.922 --> 07:34.423
It's a kid.

07:34.457 --> 07:36.191
A harnessed kid.

07:44.065 --> 07:46.533
She's unconscious,
but she seems to be coming to.

07:47.240 --> 07:48.212
Aside from that,

07:48.213 --> 07:50.214
I think her harness might be
internally damaged.

07:50.248 --> 07:51.616
It isn't glowing.

07:51.650 --> 07:53.150
We can't leave her.

07:53.185 --> 07:55.219
I want to help her, Tom,
but it's too big a risk.

07:55.253 --> 07:57.288
After Karen, we cannot afford
another enemy agent.

07:57.322 --> 07:59.123
Yeah,
you got that right, Captain.

07:59.157 --> 08:03.928
Where -- where am I?
Why does my body hurt?

08:03.962 --> 08:06.197
You were in an accident,
but you're okay.

08:06.231 --> 08:07.365
I'm Dr. Glass.

08:09.101 --> 08:10.234
Where's Tyler?

08:11.637 --> 08:14.506
Who's Tyler?

08:14.540 --> 08:17.609
My brother.
I want my brother.

08:17.643 --> 08:20.411
I'm sorry.
We don't know where he is.

08:22.414 --> 08:24.683
Ow. It hurts.

08:32.390 --> 08:34.558
All right.

08:34.592 --> 08:39.530
Just -- Anthony, would you
please secure her in the back?

08:39.563 --> 08:40.998
We've got to keep moving.

08:41.032 --> 08:42.499
Seriously?

08:42.533 --> 08:44.167
Just do it.

08:46.370 --> 08:47.671
I've been thinking.

08:47.705 --> 08:50.573
If we get to Charleston --

08:50.607 --> 08:52.041
<i>When.</i>

08:52.075 --> 08:55.211
When we get to Charleston,
what then?

08:55.245 --> 08:59.448
I'm just hoping against hope
that Ben shows up there.

09:01.317 --> 09:03.618
I didn't understand
what he was going through.

09:03.653 --> 09:05.754
I guess
I still don't know,

09:05.789 --> 09:07.757
But it'd just be nice
to talk to him, you know?

09:07.791 --> 09:10.359
It's not too late
to make that all good.

09:12.162 --> 09:14.263
Ben's coming back to us.

09:14.297 --> 09:15.564
I can feel it.

09:15.599 --> 09:17.567
Yeah, well,
I wish I could believe that,

09:17.601 --> 09:20.169
but...I just don't see how.

09:20.204 --> 09:22.372
Sometimes,
you just have to trust

09:22.407 --> 09:25.709
that fate will throw you a favor
every once in a while.

09:25.744 --> 09:28.745
I know
'cause it happened to me.

09:28.780 --> 09:30.180
Really?

09:30.215 --> 09:31.648
Yeah, I never thought
I'd recover

09:31.683 --> 09:33.684
from the life I had before.

09:33.718 --> 09:37.655
There's nothing good there.

09:37.689 --> 09:42.560
And then came...you.

09:48.067 --> 09:50.435
Uh-oh.
We got a problem.

09:55.407 --> 09:56.808
What's the story?

09:56.842 --> 09:59.077
We're overheating.
The radiator's low on water.

09:59.111 --> 10:01.078
I better pull over.
No, no, no. No. Don't, don't.

10:01.113 --> 10:02.480
Just -- just keep on going,
all right?

10:02.514 --> 10:04.248
There's a river
not too far from here.

10:04.282 --> 10:05.616
It's the Smith River, I think.
We can fill it up there.

10:05.650 --> 10:07.051
How do you know that?

10:07.085 --> 10:08.285
I used to take this route
all the time

10:08.320 --> 10:09.420
to visit my kids in Florida.

10:09.454 --> 10:11.088
Just keep going.

10:12.524 --> 10:13.824
He's kidding, right?

10:13.859 --> 10:15.759
Nope.

10:17.362 --> 10:20.464
Pope has kids.
That's a scary thought.

10:25.770 --> 10:28.673
Got you something.
Good for hydration.

10:28.707 --> 10:29.874
Oh, thank you.

10:32.610 --> 10:33.610
Mmm.

10:33.645 --> 10:35.345
How's the girl doing?

10:35.380 --> 10:37.848
Quiet.
She seems so lost.

10:37.882 --> 10:40.451
I don't think
she poses any danger.

10:40.485 --> 10:42.486
Maybe.

10:42.521 --> 10:46.357
How many more of them
are out there, huh?

10:46.391 --> 10:48.292
Thousands? Millions?

10:48.326 --> 10:51.862
Even if we kick the aliens
off the planet,

10:51.896 --> 10:55.733
which I know we will --
Of course we will --

10:55.767 --> 10:58.135
what do we do
with all of them?

11:00.272 --> 11:02.239
I mean, even if
we cut their harnesses off,

11:02.274 --> 11:05.843
they're never gonna be
normal kids again.

11:05.877 --> 11:09.747
Maybe not, but they'll adjust
somehow, find their way.

11:20.325 --> 11:22.293
What are you staring at?

11:22.327 --> 11:23.794
Nothing.

11:23.828 --> 11:27.864
Um, I just wanted to see if,
uh, you want something to eat.

11:29.233 --> 11:30.700
They're pears,

11:30.734 --> 11:33.369
so, uh, if you're not hungry,
you don't have to eat them.

11:39.542 --> 11:42.578
Been so long
since I've eaten anything.

11:44.314 --> 11:46.348
My brother, uh,
got hungry again

11:46.383 --> 11:48.417
after they took
his harness off.

11:48.452 --> 11:51.855
Yours is damaged,
so maybe that's why.

11:51.889 --> 11:55.192
Your -- your brother
was joined?

11:56.328 --> 11:57.728
Where is he?

11:58.964 --> 12:00.464
He's away.

12:02.567 --> 12:04.402
You think I could
have those, too?

12:04.436 --> 12:06.203
Sure.

12:22.520 --> 12:23.887
Sorry.

12:23.921 --> 12:26.790
I haven't done that
in a while.

12:26.824 --> 12:28.358
It's okay.

12:29.994 --> 12:34.932
M-my name's Matt,
by the way.

12:34.966 --> 12:37.001
Jenny.

12:48.781 --> 12:50.449
Aah!

12:50.483 --> 12:51.884
Damn it.

12:51.918 --> 12:54.754
Can't believe this.

12:54.788 --> 12:57.290
Relax, young Mason.

12:57.324 --> 12:59.793
The river's
within walking distance.

12:59.827 --> 13:01.795
Yeah, well, I sure hope so,
'cause we're way off course,

13:01.829 --> 13:03.896
and we're supposed to be marking
a safe route for everyone.

13:03.931 --> 13:05.965
Could be driving straight
into an ambush right now.

13:06.000 --> 13:08.668
Let's see.

13:08.702 --> 13:10.369
Hmm.

13:11.739 --> 13:13.006
Eureka!

13:13.040 --> 13:16.242
The radiator hose
has a hole.

13:16.277 --> 13:17.777
Tell you what --

13:17.811 --> 13:20.946
I'll patch it up if somebody
goes to get some water.

13:26.453 --> 13:29.322
All right.

13:30.524 --> 13:32.058
Don't worry.
I can handle him.

13:38.598 --> 13:43.302
Well, well.
Here we are at last, Maggie May.

13:43.336 --> 13:45.738
Get over yourself, Pope.

13:45.772 --> 13:48.040
How far you plan
on bringing that boy

13:48.075 --> 13:49.942
down the primrose path,
huh?

13:49.977 --> 13:54.848
As usual, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

13:57.919 --> 14:02.723
What's gonna happen when he
finds out the truth about you?

14:02.757 --> 14:04.491
Hmm?

14:04.526 --> 14:08.930
The who and <i>what</i>
<i>you really are.</i>

14:08.964 --> 14:10.665
What then?

14:37.537 --> 14:40.172
We've been on a rough road now
for about 20 hours.

14:40.206 --> 14:42.874
The constant vibration
must have cracked it.

14:42.908 --> 14:44.942
Water tank's about
a third empty,

14:44.976 --> 14:47.144
and Anne's got
a dehydrated patient.

14:47.179 --> 14:49.813
Should have kept my eye on that.
That was a stupid mistake.

14:51.849 --> 14:53.583
Worried about Hal?

14:54.685 --> 14:56.019
I'm sure he'll be fine.

14:56.053 --> 14:58.221
He's done advance scouting
before.

14:58.255 --> 15:01.091
Aah! Son of a bitch!

15:05.097 --> 15:06.130
I'm sorry.

15:06.198 --> 15:08.199
Let's see
if we can empty this

15:08.234 --> 15:11.036
into whatever canteens
we've got left.

15:14.274 --> 15:16.107
You finished with this?

15:16.142 --> 15:18.109
Yeah.

15:24.083 --> 15:25.750
Jamil's tools.

15:36.929 --> 15:38.263
So, what?

15:38.297 --> 15:41.333
You two thinking about
settling down in Chucktown?

15:41.367 --> 15:45.871
Maybe, uh, pumping out
a few Masonettes?

15:45.905 --> 15:50.008
You ask me, I think you'd be
bored out of your skull,

15:50.042 --> 15:51.743
but that's just
one man's opinion.

15:51.778 --> 15:54.112
Cut to the chase, Pope.

15:54.147 --> 15:55.881
People like us, Maggie --

15:55.915 --> 15:58.850
we don't belong
in a place like Charleston.

15:58.884 --> 16:00.251
Clips our wings.

16:00.285 --> 16:01.853
Is that a pitch?

16:01.887 --> 16:03.721
Look, I don't know
what you're plotting,

16:03.756 --> 16:05.890
but I'd rather swallow glass
than be a part of it.

16:05.924 --> 16:08.626
Okay,
I'm nothing like you.

16:08.660 --> 16:10.160
You disgust me.

16:10.195 --> 16:13.897
Well, there was a time...
when you felt differently.

16:13.931 --> 16:15.132
No.

16:15.166 --> 16:17.033
There was a time
when I lied about it.

16:17.068 --> 16:19.903
At least you're consistent.

16:21.806 --> 16:24.909
Nothing good will come
from telling him about my past.

16:26.879 --> 16:28.080
Nothing.

16:28.114 --> 16:30.950
He's bound to find out,
you know.

16:30.984 --> 16:32.652
I mean,
it's not gonna come from me.

16:32.686 --> 16:34.687
My lips are sealed.
Cross my heart, hope to die.

16:34.721 --> 16:37.623
But, uh, if he does,
then what?

16:37.658 --> 16:41.761
Look, if you love this kid
like you say you do --

16:41.795 --> 16:43.329
I never said that.

16:43.364 --> 16:47.367
If you really care for him,
you might want to sack up,

16:47.401 --> 16:51.171
tell that boy the truth,
whole truth,

16:51.205 --> 16:53.807
and nothing but the truth.

17:00.014 --> 17:01.981
I've been saving this
for almost a month.

17:02.015 --> 17:03.115
Want to split it?

17:05.886 --> 17:11.925
So, uh, what's it like
being all, you know...

17:11.960 --> 17:14.161
I'm used to it.

17:14.194 --> 17:16.329
My brother Tyler's
the same way.

17:16.364 --> 17:18.964
Your brother's harnessed,
too?

17:19.000 --> 17:22.035
Mm, he's not
my real brother.

17:22.069 --> 17:25.137
He and a couple other kids
became my siblings

17:25.172 --> 17:27.740
after we got joined
to the same Guardian.

17:27.773 --> 17:29.108
You mean Skitter.

17:29.142 --> 17:31.844
Yes. If that's
what you call them.

17:33.480 --> 17:34.914
So, what happened?

17:34.948 --> 17:38.985
My Guardian
and my other siblings...

17:39.019 --> 17:42.355
Were killed by humans.

17:42.389 --> 17:45.024
You're a human, Jenny.

17:45.059 --> 17:46.826
I loved my Guardian.

17:46.861 --> 17:48.428
She took care of me,

17:48.462 --> 17:51.798
made me feel like
I belonged to a family,

17:51.832 --> 17:54.067
the first real one
I ever had.

17:54.101 --> 17:57.170
We can be your family,
too.

17:57.204 --> 18:01.474
Everyone in the 2nd Mass
is really great.

18:01.508 --> 18:04.477
And just wait
until we get to Charleston.

18:04.511 --> 18:06.179
It's gonna be awesome.

18:06.213 --> 18:08.214
What's in Charleston?

18:08.249 --> 18:10.416
You'll see.
Hold on a second.

18:10.451 --> 18:13.186
Let me show you something.

18:13.220 --> 18:15.422
So, what were you?
A Ranger?

18:17.124 --> 18:19.025
Had to be.

18:19.060 --> 18:20.394
Yeah, why you say that?

18:20.428 --> 18:22.963
I've seen you handle
a Barrett rifle.

18:22.997 --> 18:26.867
A jarhead could never make shots
like those.

18:26.901 --> 18:28.402
Like hell you say.

18:28.436 --> 18:33.107
So you <i>were</i> a Marine.
I thought so.

18:33.141 --> 18:34.775
What rank?

18:34.810 --> 18:37.078
Gunnery sergeant.

18:38.781 --> 18:40.181
Where'd you serve?

18:40.216 --> 18:44.186
Iraq and Afghanistan,
two tours.

18:44.220 --> 18:46.922
I'm gonna talk
to whoever's in command.

18:46.957 --> 18:50.760
We're gonna need people like you
with leadership abilities.

18:50.794 --> 18:53.897
Truth be told, my plan is
to get you safely to Charleston

18:53.931 --> 18:55.499
and push on from there.

18:55.533 --> 18:58.102
To where?

18:58.136 --> 19:00.103
Wherever.

19:01.472 --> 19:03.407
I have my reasons.

19:03.441 --> 19:08.511
And with all due respect,
Captain...

19:08.546 --> 19:10.547
That's all I'm gonna say
about that.

19:13.284 --> 19:16.987
"My dad says Charleston
will be great for many reasons.

19:17.022 --> 19:20.091
"We'll have lots of food,
water, and medicine.

19:20.125 --> 19:23.327
"Dad says we'll also have
more time for school,

19:23.362 --> 19:25.430
learning, reading."

19:25.464 --> 19:28.133
See? You like reading.

19:28.167 --> 19:31.336
"And there will be more kids
my age that I can play with.

19:31.371 --> 19:34.806
I'll make more friends, which
is really great, because..."

19:34.841 --> 19:37.909
"Because I miss
not having any friends,

19:37.944 --> 19:40.445
especially
since Ben went away."

19:43.582 --> 19:49.588
A-anyway, I wouldn't put it in
the journal if it wasn't true.

19:54.393 --> 19:56.528
I'd like to come with you,
Matt,

19:56.562 --> 19:59.431
but you saw the way
the others looked at me.

19:59.466 --> 20:02.234
Even you looked at me like that
at first.

20:04.271 --> 20:05.371
Yeah.

20:05.405 --> 20:07.874
And I was wrong.

20:07.908 --> 20:12.246
The others will come around.
I'll make them.

20:12.280 --> 20:15.382
Will you please
come with us?

20:15.416 --> 20:19.319
Please, please, please?

20:31.364 --> 20:33.431
Yes!

20:39.138 --> 20:40.138
What's wrong?

20:40.172 --> 20:42.206
Tyler's here.

20:42.241 --> 20:43.908
I can feel him.

20:45.211 --> 20:46.077
Aah!

20:46.111 --> 20:47.612
Dad, help!

20:47.646 --> 20:49.380
What is it, Matt?

20:49.415 --> 20:51.182
Don't shoot!
Stop the bus!

20:52.518 --> 20:53.551
You okay?

20:53.585 --> 20:55.119
Yeah.

21:01.539 --> 21:03.073
Whatever it was
is gone now.

21:03.107 --> 21:05.909
Yeah, well, the girl
claims that "it" is her brother

21:05.943 --> 21:07.810
and he's just trying
to get her back.

21:07.845 --> 21:09.678
We can't believe
a single thing she says.

21:09.713 --> 21:11.179
In any case,
we need to keep moving.

21:11.214 --> 21:13.181
We don't have enough ammo
to defend the convoy.

21:13.216 --> 21:14.983
I'm gonna go tell Weaver.

21:21.890 --> 21:23.791
Back in business.

21:25.094 --> 21:26.794
All right, so,
we've lost about an hour,

21:26.828 --> 21:28.462
and the convoy's
probably ahead of us.

21:28.497 --> 21:29.763
There's no telling
what route they took.

21:29.798 --> 21:31.132
I hope they're all right.

21:31.166 --> 21:34.135
They're good, honest people.
I'm sure they're fine.

21:34.169 --> 21:36.704
I want to get back
on the main road.

21:36.739 --> 21:38.840
Keep dropping those cans.
Hopefully we'll find them.

21:38.874 --> 21:40.542
Yeah, listen,
I'd offer to drive,

21:40.576 --> 21:43.111
but I know you two lovebirds
have got a lot to talk about.

21:59.496 --> 22:01.196
You okay?

22:01.230 --> 22:03.064
Yeah, I'm good.

22:03.099 --> 22:04.766
You sure?

22:04.800 --> 22:05.900
Yep.

22:07.703 --> 22:08.937
Pope say something?

22:08.972 --> 22:11.039
No.

22:11.074 --> 22:13.075
Well, he must have,

22:13.109 --> 22:14.709
'cause you're starting to act a
little weird all of the sudden.

22:14.744 --> 22:16.578
Nothing he says matters,
anyway.

22:16.612 --> 22:17.746
So he <i>did</i> say something.

22:17.780 --> 22:18.780
No.

22:20.050 --> 22:21.750
What?

22:21.785 --> 22:23.652
I'll stop this truck right now
and kick his teeth in

22:23.687 --> 22:25.555
if he said something
to get you all upset.

22:25.589 --> 22:27.056
What happened?
It's nothing.

22:29.526 --> 22:31.728
Okay, cool, whatever.

22:36.801 --> 22:38.201
Hal...

22:38.235 --> 22:40.537
I said it's cool.

22:40.572 --> 22:43.040
Well, obviously, it's not.

22:45.744 --> 22:47.645
Look, if there's something
with you and Pope

22:47.680 --> 22:49.247
that I should know,
just tell me.

22:49.281 --> 22:51.082
Pope? No. No.

22:51.117 --> 22:53.685
Well, then what is it?

22:55.755 --> 22:59.724
After I got out
of the hospital...

22:59.758 --> 23:03.561
everything just looked
so fake, plastic.

23:03.595 --> 23:06.697
Everyone's smiling,
asking me if I'm okay,

23:06.732 --> 23:09.867
and, you know,
not knowing what to say

23:09.901 --> 23:12.837
about my shaved head
and my scars.

23:14.840 --> 23:18.209
I just got to the point where
I had to get away from everyone,

23:18.243 --> 23:20.578
just everything.

23:20.612 --> 23:23.214
So, suddenly,
I found myself at 18,

23:23.248 --> 23:25.984
living with this guy
in some hole,

23:26.018 --> 23:29.220
sleeping on a dirty mattress,

23:29.255 --> 23:34.593
and...slamming whatever junk
we could afford into our veins.

23:36.696 --> 23:41.100
Eventually,
we started breaking into houses

23:41.134 --> 23:44.270
and...stealing
whatever we could find.

23:44.305 --> 23:49.042
But we got caught,
and, uh...

23:49.076 --> 23:54.346
I ended up at the Framingham
Correctional Facility for Women.

23:56.884 --> 24:02.021
I found out
I was three months' pregnant.

24:02.055 --> 24:06.091
So I had my boy
in Framingham.

24:08.161 --> 24:10.162
His beautiful eyes.

24:12.031 --> 24:14.967
That's all I can remember
before they took him away.

24:22.209 --> 24:26.745
So...

24:26.779 --> 24:28.780
that's my story.

24:30.649 --> 24:32.650
That's the whole of it.

24:42.794 --> 24:44.361
217.

24:44.395 --> 24:46.397
What'd we lose?

24:46.431 --> 24:47.798
GTO.

24:47.833 --> 24:49.033
GTO?

24:49.067 --> 24:51.135
Broken axle.
Sorry, Captain.

24:51.170 --> 24:53.037
She served us well.

24:53.071 --> 24:55.039
Okay.

24:55.073 --> 24:58.042
We haven't seen any sign
from Hal, Maggie, or Pope.

24:58.076 --> 25:00.043
It's been 250 miles.

25:00.077 --> 25:01.378
I know, I know.

25:01.379 --> 25:02.689
When we get to Charleston,
we're gonna circle back

25:02.714 --> 25:03.947
and we're gonna find them.

25:03.948 --> 25:05.182
Yeah?

25:05.216 --> 25:07.284
Hal's a good kid.
He's a smart kid, Tom.

25:07.319 --> 25:09.387
He'll be fine.

25:09.421 --> 25:11.756
Both roads lead
to Charleston, Captain,

25:11.790 --> 25:13.825
but we don't know
if either are safe,

25:13.860 --> 25:15.360
so you want to
just pick one?

25:15.395 --> 25:17.930
52.
Let's mount up!

25:17.964 --> 25:19.198
Homestretch.

25:19.232 --> 25:21.334
Next stop, Charleston!

25:21.368 --> 25:23.403
Let's go!
Back in the vehicles!

25:28.042 --> 25:29.409
You smell that, Tector?

25:29.443 --> 25:30.910
What's that, Captain?

25:30.945 --> 25:33.847
The sea. The sea.

25:35.249 --> 25:37.016
Looks like
the deuce started up.

25:37.051 --> 25:39.219
They must have picked a route
to Charleston.

25:39.253 --> 25:41.154
Charleston, here we come!

25:49.496 --> 25:51.831
Don't worry.
I'll protect you.

25:51.865 --> 25:53.833
It's okay, Matt.
I-I need to go.

25:58.905 --> 26:00.873
No.

26:00.908 --> 26:02.775
He's my brother.

26:02.809 --> 26:04.377
I have to go.

26:04.411 --> 26:05.711
I won't let you!

26:05.746 --> 26:07.112
Aah!

26:07.147 --> 26:09.882
Hey!

26:14.488 --> 26:16.388
Hey, Matt.

26:16.423 --> 26:18.223
Matt.

26:33.180 --> 26:34.714
Hey, there, buddy.

26:34.748 --> 26:36.149
Ow.

26:38.252 --> 26:39.786
What happened to Jenny?

26:39.821 --> 26:43.423
I'm guessing that she went back
with her brother.

26:47.228 --> 26:51.164
Do you think Ben loves
the rebel Skitters more than us?

26:51.198 --> 26:54.835
Ben doesn't love
the rebel Skitters.

26:54.869 --> 26:57.805
He just needs to fight
with them...

26:57.839 --> 27:01.142
to protect us,
to protect you.

27:01.176 --> 27:04.879
But what if
when he's there,

27:04.913 --> 27:07.682
he realizes
that he likes them more?

27:09.285 --> 27:10.619
He won't.

27:10.653 --> 27:16.457
What if he does?
What if he doesn't come back?

27:16.492 --> 27:18.660
Then we'll go find him.

27:18.694 --> 27:20.562
What if he dies?

27:20.596 --> 27:22.664
He's not gonna die.

27:22.698 --> 27:24.799
You promise?

27:24.834 --> 27:26.735
I promise.

27:34.210 --> 27:37.613
Hey, Dad?
Do you know where my journal is?

27:50.661 --> 27:52.862
Feel better, okay?

27:52.896 --> 27:54.330
Okay.

28:05.508 --> 28:07.676
He's awake.

28:07.711 --> 28:09.445
Good.

28:19.523 --> 28:21.624
I'll go check on him.

28:32.270 --> 28:34.938
You can't help him anymore.
He's gone.

28:34.973 --> 28:37.574
That's what you said
about Jamil.

28:37.608 --> 28:39.576
Find a new line.
That one's getting old.

28:39.611 --> 28:40.711
Lourdes.

28:40.745 --> 28:42.779
Hey, don't touch --
stop it.

28:55.427 --> 28:57.628
We should be catching up to them
soon, right?

28:57.662 --> 28:58.963
Yeah.

29:00.867 --> 29:02.734
Looks like
it's getting warmer.

29:02.768 --> 29:05.303
It's still
pretty chilly out.

29:08.974 --> 29:10.742
Okay.

29:10.776 --> 29:12.945
Stop it.

29:12.979 --> 29:14.646
What?

29:18.884 --> 29:20.552
Aren't you gonna say
anything?

29:22.656 --> 29:24.623
Like -- like what?

29:24.658 --> 29:27.993
Like...anything.

29:28.028 --> 29:31.630
That's a lot to take in,
Maggie.

29:31.664 --> 29:33.732
You think that was easy
telling you?

29:33.766 --> 29:36.435
Living it? Surviving it?

29:36.469 --> 29:38.570
No.

29:38.604 --> 29:41.506
Absolutely not.

29:44.710 --> 29:48.312
I just...

29:48.347 --> 29:50.548
I-I just need time.

29:50.582 --> 29:52.683
For what?

29:52.718 --> 29:53.885
To think.

29:53.919 --> 29:54.852
Fine.

29:57.956 --> 30:00.358
Take all the time
in the world.

30:01.895 --> 30:03.862
Come and get it!

30:13.540 --> 30:17.109
It's because of what happened
to Boon, isn't it?

30:17.143 --> 30:19.945
The reason
that you're running away.

30:19.980 --> 30:22.748
Must have been tough.

30:22.783 --> 30:25.518
You were like an older brother
to that kid.

30:25.552 --> 30:27.586
You taught him
to be a soldier.

30:27.621 --> 30:29.889
A dead soldier.

30:29.923 --> 30:32.725
I'm not fit
to teach anyone anything.

30:33.927 --> 30:36.796
That's a pretty big leap,
Tector.

30:40.401 --> 30:42.102
It's not just Boon.

30:42.136 --> 30:44.404
Back in Afghanistan,

30:44.438 --> 30:47.674
I was ordered to take a patrol
into an area we'd never been.

30:48.943 --> 30:51.777
I led them
straight into an ambush.

30:53.447 --> 30:56.148
I should have known better.
The topography was perfect.

30:56.183 --> 31:00.720
I was tired.
I hadn't slept in days.

31:00.754 --> 31:03.856
I know that's no excuse.

31:03.890 --> 31:07.393
Man, they hit us
from all sides.

31:07.427 --> 31:09.728
Machine guns, RPGs.
It was chaos.

31:09.762 --> 31:15.734
I look around, and I see three
of my men just lying there...

31:17.803 --> 31:20.104
...all dead.

31:25.711 --> 31:28.146
Because of you.

31:30.616 --> 31:33.819
You killed them...
the same way you did Boon.

31:33.853 --> 31:34.920
Hey, what the hell, man?

31:34.954 --> 31:36.155
I was there. I saw it.

31:36.189 --> 31:37.456
Well, hey,
you hold on one damn minute.

31:37.490 --> 31:38.457
You murdered him.
No!

31:38.491 --> 31:39.658
Coward.

31:39.693 --> 31:40.827
That is not true!

31:40.861 --> 31:42.629
That is not true!
Hey, hey.

31:42.663 --> 31:43.763
That is not true!

31:43.798 --> 31:45.832
Hey, Tector,
of course it's not true.

31:45.867 --> 31:48.802
You didn't kill those men.

31:48.836 --> 31:51.672
You didn't kill Boon.

31:51.706 --> 31:52.740
The enemy did.

31:52.774 --> 31:53.841
Yeah.

31:53.875 --> 31:55.209
Shh...

31:55.243 --> 31:57.845
Oh, my friend...

31:57.879 --> 32:01.014
You think you're the only one
that's made mistakes?

32:01.049 --> 32:05.085
I lie awake in my cot
every night

32:05.119 --> 32:07.955
thinking about the ones
that I made and...

32:09.190 --> 32:11.492
...the people
that might still be alive

32:11.526 --> 32:13.828
if I'd made
different choices.

32:13.862 --> 32:18.165
Right after Fitchburg,
when we lost so many,

32:18.199 --> 32:19.700
I loaded up a pack.

32:19.734 --> 32:21.235
I was gonna take off
in the middle of the night.

32:21.269 --> 32:25.239
I was gonna try and hide,
run away.

32:25.273 --> 32:29.076
But I never made it
past the tent flap.

32:29.110 --> 32:31.712
What stopped you?

32:31.746 --> 32:35.716
The thought
of all those people...

32:35.750 --> 32:38.051
asleep in their cots,

32:38.086 --> 32:42.489
all confident
that I would be there

32:42.523 --> 32:45.959
to lead them
in the morning.

32:45.994 --> 32:52.533
And I felt for the first time
what that responsibility was.

32:52.567 --> 32:57.271
I knew that they needed me,
Tector.

32:57.305 --> 32:59.907
And they need you, too.

33:02.110 --> 33:05.212
Whoa!

33:08.616 --> 33:09.783
What is it?

33:09.817 --> 33:11.551
I don't know.
Everyone just stopped.

33:17.591 --> 33:21.727
Anne, hey, um...

33:21.762 --> 33:23.529
I'm sorry.

33:23.564 --> 33:27.167
I'm just still mad that...

33:27.201 --> 33:29.102
I know.

33:31.071 --> 33:33.873
Hey, I think we're here.

33:33.908 --> 33:35.541
Charleston?

33:35.576 --> 33:36.709
Really?

33:36.744 --> 33:38.911
Yeah.

33:38.946 --> 33:40.213
Oh, wow.

33:40.247 --> 33:42.949
It's hard to believe
we actually made it.

33:42.983 --> 33:44.250
I know.

33:55.962 --> 33:57.796
What's going on?

33:57.830 --> 33:59.330
I don't know.

35:22.634 --> 35:25.203
Talk to me, Tom.

35:27.840 --> 35:30.509
I was so sure
that Charleston was real.

35:33.613 --> 35:35.581
I wanted it to be true.

35:37.918 --> 35:43.323
For you, for Matt,
for everyone.

35:43.357 --> 35:44.758
For me.

35:48.429 --> 35:51.365
Just to have a chance
to rebuild our lives,

35:51.399 --> 35:54.568
just to make some sense out of
everything that's happened...

35:54.602 --> 35:56.303
to Ben.

35:59.441 --> 36:01.608
And there's nothing.

36:01.643 --> 36:04.879
There's nothing.

36:04.913 --> 36:06.781
It's not nothing.

36:06.815 --> 36:09.517
I don't know where Hal is,

36:09.552 --> 36:12.754
and I don't think
I'm ever gonna see Ben again.

36:12.788 --> 36:15.690
And my 9-year-old
just made out his will.

36:37.580 --> 36:42.751
We're all just a heartbeat away
from death.

36:42.785 --> 36:45.353
We always have been.

36:45.388 --> 36:47.855
We always will be.

36:47.890 --> 36:50.825
That's not a reason
to lose hope.

36:50.859 --> 36:53.461
We're not dead yet.

36:55.297 --> 36:56.297
Yeah.

37:13.549 --> 37:16.552
They're, uh -- they're waiting
for you, Captain.

37:16.586 --> 37:20.789
Not now, Tector.

37:20.824 --> 37:24.826
They need you...
now more than ever.

37:27.630 --> 37:30.665
I don't know
what to say to them.

37:30.699 --> 37:36.404
I respectfully suggest
you make something up...

37:36.439 --> 37:39.474
Sir.

37:58.461 --> 38:01.063
Gather around.

38:16.445 --> 38:18.545
So, Charleston was a bust.

38:20.782 --> 38:23.050
We thought we were gonna have
paradise on Earth

38:23.084 --> 38:25.987
delivered to us
right here on a silver platter.

38:27.589 --> 38:30.425
We should have known better.

38:30.459 --> 38:34.529
<i>I</i> should have known better.

38:36.932 --> 38:40.467
It doesn't mean
that the dream was bad.

38:40.502 --> 38:44.705
It just means that we are
gonna have to work harder

38:44.739 --> 38:46.774
to make it happen.

38:50.812 --> 38:53.046
Now, the choice is simple.

38:53.080 --> 38:55.448
You can lie down and quit,

38:55.483 --> 38:58.886
curse God
at the unfairness of it all,

38:58.920 --> 39:01.821
or you can come with me...

39:03.824 --> 39:06.959
...find another place to live,

39:06.993 --> 39:11.597
a place where we can build
the community

39:11.631 --> 39:13.432
that we hoped to find here.

39:16.736 --> 39:18.771
So, here's what we're gonna do.

39:18.805 --> 39:21.573
We're gonna get back
in those vehicles!

39:21.608 --> 39:22.641
Yeah. Yeah.

39:22.675 --> 39:23.942
And we're gonna go on!

39:23.976 --> 39:25.644
Yeah!

39:25.678 --> 39:27.913
Even if it means we have to
carry the damn things

39:27.947 --> 39:29.148
on our backs!

39:41.594 --> 39:43.695
Who goes there?

39:50.169 --> 39:52.036
Identify yourself.

39:52.104 --> 39:54.038
Hold your fire.

39:54.106 --> 39:57.475
Colonel Porter,
First Continental Army.

40:02.548 --> 40:04.215
Hello, Dan.

40:04.249 --> 40:05.850
Jim?

40:05.884 --> 40:09.453
Heard the shot,
and then I spotted your outfit.

40:09.487 --> 40:12.022
How you doing, buddy?
Whoa.

40:12.056 --> 40:13.523
Good to see you.

40:13.557 --> 40:15.191
What the heck
took you so long?

40:15.226 --> 40:19.462
Well, we had to stop by
some gift shops

40:19.497 --> 40:21.698
and some diners on the way,
you know?

40:21.732 --> 40:24.000
We can do better than diners.

40:24.034 --> 40:25.568
Let me have some of that.

40:27.738 --> 40:29.139
Try that on for size.

40:29.173 --> 40:31.474
Strawberries.

40:31.509 --> 40:33.877
Hey, Tom.
You've been busy.

40:33.911 --> 40:35.545
What do you mean?

40:35.579 --> 40:38.615
Little legend building
around you, Tom Mason.

40:40.518 --> 40:41.919
Where'd all this
come from?

40:41.987 --> 40:43.721
Those came from
the new capital

40:43.755 --> 40:45.657
of the United States
of America --

40:45.691 --> 40:47.192
Charleston, South Carolina.

40:47.226 --> 40:49.561
We were just in Charleston.
There was nothing there.

40:49.595 --> 40:51.697
Yeah, well,
looks can be deceiving,

40:51.731 --> 40:54.666
as you people from the 2nd Mass
are about to find out.

40:54.700 --> 40:56.167
Dan, let's get them all
mustered.

40:56.201 --> 40:57.735
I want to get everybody settled
before nightfall.

40:57.770 --> 40:58.736
Yes, sir.

40:58.771 --> 41:00.572
See you, Tom.

41:00.606 --> 41:02.540
Let's go.

41:04.743 --> 41:06.677
Oh, you had me worried.

41:09.248 --> 41:10.915
Colonel Porter's patrol
found us.

41:10.949 --> 41:12.617
He wanted to bring us back
with him.

41:12.685 --> 41:14.185
I said, "Hell no.
The 2nd Mass is out there."

41:14.220 --> 41:15.220
Hal!

41:15.254 --> 41:17.222
Hey, there he is.

41:22.094 --> 41:24.696
The only one missing is Ben.

41:26.966 --> 41:29.200
I got a strong feeling
we're gonna see Ben again.

41:29.235 --> 41:31.035
Really?

41:31.070 --> 41:32.770
Of course.

41:32.804 --> 41:36.840
I figured out sometimes
fate throws you a favor.

41:38.643 --> 41:41.711
We just got to make sure
that we're around to catch it.

41:44.648 --> 41:46.649
Oh, you're getting big.

41:46.717 --> 41:49.118
Let's go to Charleston.
