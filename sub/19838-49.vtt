00:02.010 --> 00:03.860
<b><i>The King's self-injury...</i></b>

00:03.860 --> 00:05.380
<b><i>The third party...</i></b>

00:06.160 --> 00:09.730
<b><i>We still haven't correctly 
deduced what happened.</i></b>

00:10.770 --> 00:11.870
<b><i>I have a feeling...</i></b>

00:12.890 --> 00:18.730
<b><i>At worst, the answer we find could 
potentially ruin all of our plans.</i></b>

00:19.000 --> 00:20.120
<b>It's time!</b>

00:21.270 --> 00:22.790
<b>One minute to go.</b>

00:23.230 --> 00:24.250
<b>Gather around.</b>

00:24.810 --> 00:26.690
<b><i>Damn! We're out of time...</i></b>

01:47.000 --> 01:52.040
<b>Charge x And x Invade</b>

02:51.820 --> 02:54.740
<b>Two minutes before Morel 
issued the call to attack...</b>

03:03.650 --> 03:08.120
<b>Two men leaped from a giant bird flying high over</b>

03:09.570 --> 03:11.680
<b>the Republic of East Gorteau.</b>

03:47.290 --> 03:49.860
<b>Pitou was the first one to notice.</b>

03:52.220 --> 03:55.500
<b>The only reason Pitou decided to look up</b>

03:56.170 --> 03:58.680
<b>was "just because."</b>

03:59.670 --> 04:01.960
<b>Pitou's hunch was just that faint.</b>

04:02.760 --> 04:04.100
<b><i>Something is coming.</i></b>

04:04.790 --> 04:08.680
<b>However, a few seconds later, 
that hunch turned to certainty.</b>

04:11.360 --> 04:12.250
<b><i>The enemy.</i></b>

04:12.520 --> 04:16.480
<b>But at that point, the enemy was still very high up.</b>

04:17.230 --> 04:24.770
<b>Too high for even Pitou's 
exceptional senses to ascertain.</b>

04:26.300 --> 04:30.070
<b>Pitou's decision to prepare for battle</b>

04:30.570 --> 04:33.780
<b>was based solely on primal instinct.</b>

04:42.690 --> 04:44.240
<b>Pitou's <i>En</i>...</b>

04:45.640 --> 04:47.050
<b>has vanished.</b>

04:59.770 --> 05:06.010
<b>Two of the Royal Guard almost 
simultaneously spotted the approaching form.</b>

05:12.520 --> 05:13.570
<b><i>A dragon!</i></b>

05:13.830 --> 05:16.820
<b>At the Same Time</b>

05:18.220 --> 05:20.090
<b>Ten seconds to go.</b>

05:21.440 --> 05:22.320
<b>Nine!</b>

05:24.460 --> 05:25.510
<b>Eight!</b>

05:27.360 --> 05:28.320
<b>Seven.</b>

05:29.030 --> 05:31.160
<b>As Morel counted down to the attack,</b>

05:31.590 --> 05:35.540
<b>Killua alone noticed that Gon's eyes sank</b>

05:35.540 --> 05:40.610
<b>to a deep, dark, silent coldness beside him.</b>

05:42.810 --> 05:43.800
<b>Six...</b>

05:49.480 --> 05:50.410
<b>Five.</b>

05:55.960 --> 05:56.830
<b>Four.</b>

06:01.370 --> 06:02.430
<b>Three.</b>

06:05.440 --> 06:06.380
<b>Two.</b>

06:11.300 --> 06:14.050
<b>This was when Pitou ceased using <i>En</i>,</b>

06:14.990 --> 06:17.880
<b>in order to prepare for the coming fight.</b>

06:19.840 --> 06:20.700
<b>However...</b>

06:25.890 --> 06:26.780
<b>One.</b>

06:29.310 --> 06:33.910
<b>Go!</b>

06:46.450 --> 06:49.470
<b>Your Majesty!</b>

06:50.530 --> 06:52.970
<b>Dragon Meteor Shower
Dragon Dive</b>

06:50.610 --> 06:52.300
<b><i>Dragon Dive.</i></b>

06:56.340 --> 06:58.570
<b>The sighting of the enemy</b>

06:58.570 --> 07:02.230
<b>and the decision to stop using <i>En</i> 
in preparation for battle had backfired.</b>

07:04.480 --> 07:05.480
<b><i>Where are they?</i></b>

07:11.540 --> 07:13.980
<b>Faced with a serious threat to the King,</b>

07:13.980 --> 07:17.040
<b>Pitou's six senses, sharpened to their limits,</b>

07:17.730 --> 07:21.750
<b>immediately focused on the intruders.</b>

07:24.090 --> 07:28.330
<b>The countless dragons that rained 
down were less significant threats</b>

07:29.820 --> 07:31.430
<b>than the humans in the sky.</b>

07:38.770 --> 07:40.270
<b><i>Terpsichora!</i></b>

07:38.790 --> 07:40.260
<b>Puppet Master's Serenity 
Terpsichora</b>

07:40.520 --> 07:45.270
<b>Pitou uses this <i>Nen</i> ability when 
full power is required to fight.</b>

07:46.140 --> 07:51.030
<b>It takes less than a tenth of a second 
after activation to launch the attack.</b>

07:54.720 --> 07:58.280
<b>However, during that fraction of a second, 
Pitou could hear Netero speaking.</b>

07:59.310 --> 08:03.290
<b>I prepared for a variety of responses.</b>

08:05.830 --> 08:10.270
<b>But you've made a bad move, little Ant.</b>

08:12.530 --> 08:14.620
<b>Bad Move</b>

08:18.610 --> 08:20.250
<b><i>It really happens.</i></b>

08:21.270 --> 08:22.870
<b><i>You don't think it's possible.</i></b>

08:23.350 --> 08:24.690
<b><i>But it is.</i></b>

08:26.440 --> 08:28.720
<b><i>It's like when your life flashes before your eyes.</i></b>

08:28.720 --> 08:35.700
<b><i>When you know you're about to die, you feel 
as though time slows, and you review your life.</i></b>

08:36.270 --> 08:38.200
<b><i>It's just like that.</i></b>

08:39.160 --> 08:43.030
<b><i>In fact, I'd consider this 
phenomenon even more credible.</i></b>

08:43.030 --> 08:48.460
<b><i>Because you can hear what 
the other person is thinking.</i></b>

08:50.580 --> 08:55.500
<b><i>You can even obtain information 
known only to the other person.</i></b>

08:55.500 --> 08:57.640
<b><i>There is proof that it worked.</i></b>

08:58.870 --> 09:03.230
<b><i>Martial artists call this "listening with the spirit."</i></b>

09:04.500 --> 09:05.480
<b>Listening with the Spirit</b>

09:05.480 --> 09:12.070
<b><i>It's a time perception paradox that occurs 
commonly when two skilled warriors clash.</i></b>

09:15.560 --> 09:18.200
<b><i>The secret behind the old man's strength?</i></b>

09:18.790 --> 09:21.440
<b><i>I can think of a few possibilities.</i></b>

09:21.980 --> 09:25.120
<b><i>First, his</i> Nen <i>is very quiet.</i></b>

09:25.620 --> 09:30.710
<b><i>No one can predict his next 
attack by reading his aura.</i></b>

09:32.050 --> 09:34.980
<b><i>He's lived a long time for a reason.</i></b>

09:34.980 --> 09:38.010
<b><i>He has a plant's mental toughness.</i></b>

09:40.280 --> 09:45.980
<b><i>Hell, he was an old man when 
I was still breast feeding.</i></b>

09:46.620 --> 09:51.110
<b><i>He's the only man to fight my grandpa and survive.</i></b>

09:51.770 --> 09:53.550
<b><i>I'd consider him an acquaintance.</i></b>

09:54.000 --> 09:56.430
<b><i>We are like yin and yang.</i></b>

09:57.570 --> 10:00.100
<b><i>Fool, we aren't evenly matched.</i></b>

10:00.100 --> 10:02.740
<b><i>He always has the upper hand.</i></b>

10:04.850 --> 10:05.870
<b><i>What?</i></b>

10:06.400 --> 10:08.530
<b><i>The secret behind his strength?</i></b>

10:09.200 --> 10:12.350
<b><i>I guess there's also that...</i></b>

10:12.350 --> 10:14.380
<b><i>When it comes to battle,</i></b>

10:15.210 --> 10:17.230
<b><i>he has the Hundred-type Guanyin Bodhisattva.</i></b>

10:18.500 --> 10:21.740
<b><i>That is his most dangerous ability.</i></b>

10:35.390 --> 10:44.800
<b>Netero's sequential movements appeared 
exceedingly gradual and fluid to Pitou.</b>

10:46.220 --> 10:47.410
<b>No</b>

10:46.380 --> 10:47.410
<b>No...</b>

10:48.280 --> 10:52.810
<b>There was no doubt that 
Netero's motions had ended</b>

10:52.810 --> 10:56.270
<b>in the moment between Pitou's <i>Nen</i> 
activation and subsequent attack.</b>

10:59.580 --> 11:04.650
<b>Essentially, this required the 
constriction of time perception,</b>

11:04.650 --> 11:08.760
<b>almost to the point of stopping 
time entirely for Pitou alone,</b>

11:09.160 --> 11:14.100
<b>in order to perceive Netero's actions.</b>

11:16.440 --> 11:18.090
<b>In other words, the result was...</b>

11:28.610 --> 11:31.560
<b>an attack that could not be dodged.</b>

11:58.580 --> 12:03.610
<b>Netero, forty-six years old, 
in the dead of winter.</b>

12:04.840 --> 12:08.070
<b>Sensing that he had reached his limits 
of both body and technique,</b>

12:08.580 --> 12:10.760
<b>he spent much time in contemplation</b>

12:11.810 --> 12:14.130
<b>before he reached an answer.</b>

12:14.650 --> 12:16.540
<b>Gratitude</b>

12:15.900 --> 12:17.910
<b>That answer was gratitude.</b>

12:34.170 --> 12:35.230
<b><i>Amen...</i></b>

13:02.990 --> 13:08.280
<b>He owed a debt to the martial arts 
that had helped him to mature.</b>

13:09.740 --> 13:13.730
<b>The method he came up with to 
repay that debt as best he could...</b>

13:17.880 --> 13:21.860
<b>was to throw 10,000 punches of gratitude every day.</b>

13:24.470 --> 13:25.790
<b>He would calm himself,</b>

13:26.850 --> 13:27.700
<b>worship,</b>

13:30.120 --> 13:30.990
<b>pray,</b>

13:31.750 --> 13:32.920
<b>ready himself,</b>

13:33.860 --> 13:35.150
<b>then punch.</b>

13:47.740 --> 13:52.510
<b>At first, completing the sequence 
took five or six seconds.</b>

13:54.370 --> 14:00.790
<b>On the first day, he required over 18 
hours to complete 10,000 punches.</b>

14:02.230 --> 14:05.130
<b>Upon completion, he'd fall asleep on the spot.</b>

14:07.280 --> 14:10.300
<b>When he awoke, he resumed 
punching, day after day.</b>

15:31.160 --> 15:35.210
<b>After two years, he noticed a difference.</b>

15:42.090 --> 15:46.000
<b>After he'd completed 10,000 punches, 
the sun was still up.</b>

15:52.870 --> 15:56.680
<b>At age fifty, he had made a perfect metamorphosis.</b>

15:59.010 --> 16:02.000
<b>He managed to complete 10,000 
punches of gratitude</b>

16:04.220 --> 16:06.190
<b>in under an hour.</b>

16:14.790 --> 16:18.090
<b>This left him more time for prayer.</b>

17:04.690 --> 17:08.880
<b>When Netero came down from 
the mountains, his fists</b>

17:10.700 --> 17:12.970
<b>were faster than sound.</b>

17:20.900 --> 17:22.510
<b><i>Was that my imagination?</i></b>

17:22.940 --> 17:25.270
<b><i>For a moment, he seemed to disappear...</i></b>

17:25.440 --> 17:27.750
<b><i>I didn't hear anything until after...</i></b>

17:29.210 --> 17:30.430
<b><i>Master?</i></b>

17:31.040 --> 17:31.780
<b><i>Laâ€”</i></b>

17:34.110 --> 17:35.960
<b><i>Lady Guanyin...</i></b>

17:40.260 --> 17:41.490
<b><i>So...</i></b>

17:45.200 --> 17:47.540
<b><i>Are you willing to defend your school?</i></b>

17:48.790 --> 17:52.490
<b><i>I offer you my school.</i></b>

17:54.410 --> 17:59.130
<b><i>Please accept me as a student!</i></b>

18:00.700 --> 18:03.590
<b>A monster was born.</b>

18:04.840 --> 18:08.240
<b><i>Sure, if you give me something to eat.</i></b>

18:09.290 --> 18:13.770
<b>This happened over six decades ago.</b>

19:00.720 --> 19:04.700
<b><i>Considering where his hands stopped, 
the attack shouldn't come from there...</i></b>

19:05.370 --> 19:06.540
<b><i>How?!</i></b>

19:08.560 --> 19:12.540
<b>I hope that you will not return.</b>

19:15.080 --> 19:18.050
<b><i>This will force me a long distance away!</i></b>

19:18.050 --> 19:20.300
<b>Your Majesty!</b>

19:20.700 --> 19:21.650
<b>Pouf!</b>

19:22.370 --> 19:25.800
<b><i>He can't hear me... 
He's too worried about the King.</i></b>

19:27.470 --> 19:28.910
<b><i>Doctor Blythe!</i></b>

19:29.480 --> 19:34.820
<b>By its nature, this ability could 
only be used for healing.</b>

19:35.650 --> 19:40.010
<b>Doctor Blythe cannot move from 
its initial summoned position.</b>

19:40.430 --> 19:44.810
<b>Since the puppet is connected to Pitou's tail,</b>

19:44.810 --> 19:47.950
<b>Pitou must stay within twenty meters.</b>

19:54.940 --> 19:56.480
<b>That restriction</b>

19:58.720 --> 20:01.220
<b>kept Pitou in the fight.</b>

20:02.110 --> 20:03.450
<b><i>I've stopped?</i></b>

20:08.600 --> 20:09.480
<b><i>Quickly...</i></b>

20:13.240 --> 20:13.980
<b><i>Quickly!</i></b>

20:39.070 --> 20:41.010
<b>Midnight</b>

21:50.430 --> 21:57.640
<b>There, they encountered someone they 
hadn't counted on seeing at this point.</b>

21:57.640 --> 21:59.540
<b>It was Youpi.</b>

23:24.760 --> 23:27.110
<b>Next time: Monster x And x Monster.</b>

23:27.110 --> 23:29.060
<b>Roar! I'm gonna eat you!</b>

23:29.060 --> 23:30.990
<b>Go ahead and try!</b>

23:30.990 --> 23:31.670
<b>Chomp.</b>

23:31.670 --> 23:33.050
<b>Ow! Payback time!</b>

23:33.050 --> 23:33.650
<b>Chomp chomp!</b>

23:33.650 --> 23:35.070
<b>Chomp chomp chomp chomp chomp chomp!</b>

23:35.070 --> 23:36.140
<b>Chomp chomp!</b>
