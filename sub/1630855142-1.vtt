I feel so guilty. - Trust me.

33:34.180 --> 33:36.350
I know how you feel. It wasn't easy for me either.

33:36.350 --> 33:37.519
But you have a lot on your plate

33:37.519 --> 33:39.423

33:39.423 --> 33:41.327
- I know, but it was still my baby so I feel so guilty

33:41.327 --> 33:43.932
and I gotta deal with this right now, like I'm in pain.

33:43.932 --> 33:46.504
- He was only using you to get to your dad. Like fuck him.

33:46.504 --> 33:49.543
He didn't really care about you. You will be fine.

33:49.543 --> 33:50.412
Come on.

Nigga, don't worry, your wife's not gonna find out.

01:15:17.846 --> 01:15:19.248
- This dumb fuck doesn't even realize

01:15:19.248 --> 01:15:20.785
that his reign is coming to an end soon.

01:15:20.785 --> 01:15:22.188
- Real soon.

01:15:22.188 --> 01:15:23.190

01:15:24.960 --> 01:15:26.362

After the Fed's raid the crib, the lawyers took the rest.

- Well China you already know

01:41:09.845 --> 01:41:12.918
we don't got other lawyer money.

01:41:12.918 --> 01:41:17.194
- Better get it 'cause it is not giving eight years.

01:41:18.362 --> 01:41:19.998
It's not.

01:41:19.998 --> 01:41:22.237

01:41:22.237 --> 01:41:24.942

Yeah. Better be going on a run.

01:41:39.638 --> 01:41:42.577
(crowd chattering)

01:41:46.685 --> 01:41:48.356
- Mr. Jones, Mr. Jackson,

01:41:48.356 --> 01:41:52.964
I just wanna be certain that you both understand

01:41:52.964 --> 01:41:56.472
the arrangement of your plea deal.

01:41:56.472 --> 01:41:58.576
- Yes your honor.

01:41:58.576 --> 01:42:03.586
- Gentlemen, I can only hope that this time allows you both

01:42:05.390 --> 01:42:08.696
to think about the damage that you've caused to society

01:42:11.067 --> 01:42:15.008
and perhaps whilst away you use the time wisely

01:42:16.512 --> 01:42:19.151
so that upon your release,

01:42:19.151 --> 01:42:23.359
both of you will return as better men, case closed.

01:42:38.756 --> 01:42:42.530
- Excuse me, I saw you in the court room.

01:42:42.530 --> 01:42:44.401
What were you there for?

01:42:44.401 --> 01:42:45.603
- I'm not here for you. I'm here to speak to China.

01:42:45.603 --> 01:42:48.175
- About? - About me and Q's baby.

01:42:48.175 --> 01:42:49.177
That's what. - China.

01:42:49.177 --> 01:42:50.613
- You hear this shit?

01:42:50.613 --> 01:42:52.317
She talking about this her and Q baby.

01:42:52.317 --> 01:42:53.719
Like you. - Q baby?

01:42:53.719 --> 01:42:55.289
How this Q baby.

01:42:55.289 --> 01:42:56.759
- I know this is a bad time,

01:42:56.759 --> 01:42:59.264
but my name is Alexis and I'm Q's baby mom.

01:42:59.264 --> 01:43:01.702
- You're who? - This is our baby Joy.

01:43:01.702 --> 01:43:03.506
- That's your baby? - No, that's not.

01:43:03.506 --> 01:43:05.410
That's not Q's.

01:43:05.410 --> 01:43:06.812
- No, that baby don't look like my grandson at all.

01:43:06.812 --> 01:43:08.315
- At all. - Don't look nothing like him.

01:43:08.315 --> 01:43:09.718
- Hold on. Hold on.

01:43:09.718 --> 01:43:11.321
Let me let just lemme just get this-

01:43:11.321 --> 01:43:12.357
- You be sure- - How old is she?

01:43:12.357 --> 01:43:14.227
- She's two now. - Two?

01:43:14.227 --> 01:43:16.632
So you was pregnant at the same time as me?

01:43:16.632 --> 01:43:18.269
- Yeah we was actually dating

01:43:18.269 --> 01:43:19.704
before y'all got married actually.

01:43:19.704 --> 01:43:21.542
- Never heard about you. That's crazy.

01:43:21.542 --> 01:43:25.283
- Never said about us? - Never, never, nothing, no.

01:43:26.618 --> 01:43:28.255
- I just felt like that you should know.

01:43:28.255 --> 01:43:30.460
- Thank you so much, thank you so much.

01:43:30.460 --> 01:43:35.470
Thank you for telling me. (crowd chattering)

01:43:42.650 --> 01:43:47.192
- I asked for drugs, China gave them to me.

01:43:47.192 --> 01:43:49.764
(keys clacking)

01:43:50.833 --> 01:43:52.770
- Who the fuck is Alexis?

01:43:53.772 --> 01:43:55.676
Ain't no huh?

01:43:55.676 --> 01:43:57.447
Who the fuck is Alexis? She said y'all got a baby.

01:43:57.447 --> 01:43:59.384
Y'all baby the same age as ours.

01:43:59.384 --> 01:44:01.655
So what's going on? - China, listen to me.

01:44:01.655 --> 01:44:03.425
Clearly, she's just trying to break us up.

01:44:03.425 --> 01:44:05.730
- What, why would she try to break up our home

01:44:05.730 --> 01:44:08.469
if she don't even fucking know me?

01:44:08.469 --> 01:44:10.606
She didn't, she said she didn't. I'm confused.

01:44:10.606 --> 01:44:12.410
- All right, listen.

01:44:12.410 --> 01:44:13.812
I'm gonna keep it a thousand with you. All right.

01:44:13.812 --> 01:44:16.585
Me and Lex met a while back. All right.

01:44:16.585 --> 01:44:18.689
She was in college so I was helping her out,

01:44:18.689 --> 01:44:20.560
know what I mean?

01:44:20.560 --> 01:44:21.929
When she got pregnant, I ain't want her to keep the baby,

01:44:21.929 --> 01:44:23.866
know what I mean?

01:44:23.866 --> 01:44:25.603
But she wanted to keep it and I didn't know how to tell you,

01:44:25.603 --> 01:44:26.738
I mean how the fuck do you tell your wife

01:44:26.738 --> 01:44:28.542
some shit like that?

01:44:28.542 --> 01:44:30.880
- No, you're fucking lying, you're done. Period.

01:44:30.880 --> 01:44:32.249
- Come on China like I need you to actually

01:44:32.249 --> 01:44:33.619
just hear me out on this.

01:44:33.619 --> 01:44:34.955
- Don't call my fucking phone number.

01:44:34.955 --> 01:44:35.823
I'm not doing nothing else for you.

01:44:35.823 --> 01:44:36.925
- No China wait.

01:44:36.925 --> 01:44:38.329
- Bye bitch. - No.

01:44:38.329 --> 01:44:39.598
- Rot there. - Fuck, man.

01:44:40.833 --> 01:44:43.505
(upbeat music)

01:44:56.498 --> 01:45:00.606
- You gonna be a good boy for aunt Keda?

01:45:00.606 --> 01:45:03.612
Yeah. You gonna miss me? - Yeah.

01:45:03.612 --> 01:45:06.017
- What's happening, friend.

01:45:06.017 --> 01:45:07.553
- Hey nephew. - You look good.

01:45:07.553 --> 01:45:09.424
Damn you is, ah, okay!

01:45:10.760 --> 01:45:12.797
You gonna be cool? - Yep.

01:45:12.797 --> 01:45:14.401
- All right let me know if you need anything.

01:45:14.401 --> 01:45:16.371
I love you. - Will do, love you too.

01:45:16.371 --> 01:45:18.074
- Y'all have fun. - Say bye Mommy.

01:45:18.074 --> 01:45:20.546
- Bye mommy. - Be good. Okay.

01:45:26.090 --> 01:45:29.364
(suspenseful music)

01:45:33.004 --> 01:45:35.710
(soft knocking)

01:45:43.459 --> 01:45:47.400
(knocking continues) - Hold on.

01:45:49.002 --> 01:45:49.871
Coming.

01:45:53.479 --> 01:45:55.014
- China White? - Yes.

01:45:56.585 --> 01:45:58.856
What the fuck is y'all fucking serious,

01:45:58.856 --> 01:45:59.824
y'all cannot lock me up.

01:45:59.824 --> 01:46:01.461
I have a son.

01:46:01.461 --> 01:46:02.597
- You have the right to remain silent.

01:46:02.597 --> 01:46:04.501
- Y'all not about to do this.

01:46:04.501 --> 01:46:05.870
- Anything you say can and will be used against you

01:46:05.870 --> 01:46:07.473
in a court of law. - Oh my god.

01:46:07.473 --> 01:46:08.842
- You have the right to an attorney.

01:46:08.842 --> 01:46:09.978
If you cannot afford an attorney,

01:46:09.978 --> 01:46:11.848
one will be provided to you.

01:46:11.848 --> 01:46:13.485
Do you understand these rights as I have read them.

01:46:13.485 --> 01:46:15.623
- Y'all can't lock me up for what?

01:46:15.623 --> 01:46:16.992
I have a son.

01:46:16.992 --> 01:46:18.127
You should have thought about your son

01:46:18.127 --> 01:46:19.964
before you sold multiple ounces.

01:46:19.964 --> 01:46:20.833
- What?

01:46:21.935 --> 01:46:23.972
This fucking breaks.

01:46:23.972 --> 01:46:25.609
Hey yo. This is fucking crazy.

01:46:25.609 --> 01:46:28.214
Like what about my fucking my son.

01:46:28.214 --> 01:46:31.488
Save your lies Miss White. We got it all on tape.

01:46:31.488 --> 01:46:36.130
- I have a lawyer and I will be out by tomorrow, so, okay.

01:46:37.199 --> 01:46:39.704
Not getting it, going to jail.

01:46:39.704 --> 01:46:43.244
My fucking son Rick needs, is this a set up.

01:46:45.683 --> 01:46:48.622
- [Speaker] White. You got a visit.

01:46:57.573 --> 01:46:59.811
- Show me your hands.

01:46:59.811 --> 01:47:01.681
Turn around. Back out.

01:47:04.854 --> 01:47:07.994
Turn to your right. Walk to the front.

01:47:10.633 --> 01:47:12.703
- Hey baby. - Hi dad.

01:47:12.703 --> 01:47:15.709
- Hi honey. - Hi son, hi mom.

01:47:15.709 --> 01:47:17.178
- How are you holding up in here?

01:47:17.178 --> 01:47:20.118
- I'm okay I just want to get home to y'all.

01:47:20.118 --> 01:47:22.890
Chase is getting so big. I feel so bad, I left him.

01:47:22.890 --> 01:47:25.094
Oh my god. - It's going be all right.

01:47:25.094 --> 01:47:26.965
Just keep your head up.

01:47:26.965 --> 01:47:29.002
- I miss y'all so much. I can't wait to get outta here.

01:47:29.002 --> 01:47:30.906
I can't believe they took me from my son.

01:47:30.906 --> 01:47:33.645
He's getting so big. I feel so bad.

01:47:33.645 --> 01:47:35.348
- It's all right baby. Just keep your head up.

01:47:35.348 --> 01:47:37.252
Keep your head up.

01:47:37.252 --> 01:47:40.191
- He is getting big but two years is going fly by so fast.

01:47:40.191 --> 01:47:42.630
Well he's gonna be well taken care of, we got him.

01:47:42.630 --> 01:47:44.968
- You already knew that. - Yeah.

01:47:44.968 --> 01:47:47.372
- Mommy. - I love y'all so much.

01:47:47.372 --> 01:47:50.111
I appreciate y'all. I can't believe Mark was a snitch.

01:47:50.111 --> 01:47:52.115
- And don't worry about Mark, I got that.

01:47:52.115 --> 01:47:54.988
You just take care of what you need to take care of in here.

01:47:54.988 --> 01:47:57.125
- Yeah, I got you Dad.

01:47:57.125 --> 01:48:00.699

- He treated me good.

01:48:02.402 --> 01:48:05.943
- That motherfucker better as much money as I'm paying.

01:48:05.943 --> 01:48:08.114

01:48:14.292 --> 01:48:17.967
- We love you. - I just wanna be with y'all.

01:48:19.269 --> 01:48:21.407
- White, your visit is up.

01:48:25.014 --> 01:48:28.187
(buzzer blaring)

01:48:28.187 --> 01:48:31.060
(traffic roaring)

01:48:43.451 --> 01:48:48.461
(horns honking) (gun firing)

01:48:59.817 --> 01:49:02.489
(engine roaring)

01:49:09.469 --> 01:49:12.075
- [Judge] Ms. White, I've reviewed your case

01:49:12.075 --> 01:49:15.348
and I see you've accepted a plea deal, is that correct?

01:49:15.348 --> 01:49:18.889
- Yes, your honor. - Thank you. Next case.

01:49:23.899 --> 01:49:25.334

and poking at you right.

02:11:16.052 --> 02:11:19.125
But either he gets life or I get life

02:11:20.194 --> 02:11:22.765
'cause I'm gonna kill him.

02:11:22.765 --> 02:11:24.202
That's, he's an animal.

02:11:24.202 --> 02:11:27.008
What he did to you I can't let that go.

02:11:27.008 --> 02:11:30.247
I can't let, he can't walk on the planet no more, that's it.

02:11:30.247 --> 02:11:32.151
He's done.

02:11:32.151 --> 02:11:35.959
So I know it's tough but you going to have to stand up.

02:11:35.959 --> 02:11:38.932
- I got you dad. - I got you.

02:11:38.932 --> 02:11:41.102
- Period now what we be doing,

02:11:41.102 --> 02:11:42.772
'cause I need to get my mind off of this.

02:11:42.772 --> 02:11:44.275
- All right? Let's go get something to eat.

02:11:44.275 --> 02:11:48.784
- Let's go. (upbeat electronic music)

02:11:54.629 --> 02:11:58.570
- Ms. Morgan, you and your client please stand.

02:12:09.826 --> 02:12:13.166
Mr. Lewis, you were reckless beyond words

02:12:15.738 --> 02:12:20.748
and never once gave thought to this young woman's life

02:12:22.118 --> 02:12:24.589
or the damage that you did to her, her son,

02:12:25.324 --> 02:12:27.862
and the innocent people

02:12:27.862 --> 02:12:31.269
who could have been victims that night.

02:12:31.269 --> 02:12:33.975
You were given a second chance

02:12:33.975 --> 02:12:37.715
even after you'd taken another person's life

02:12:39.285 --> 02:12:43.093
still yet you have not learned from your mistakes.

02:12:44.662 --> 02:12:47.768
Today you will not get another chance.

02:12:49.339 --> 02:12:52.912
Mr. Lewis, is there anything you'd like to say

02:12:54.248 --> 02:12:56.686
before I pronounce your sentence?

02:12:58.790 --> 02:13:03.767
- Yeah, fuck you, and- (crowd chattering)

02:13:04.836 --> 02:13:06.973
- [Judge] Ms. Morgan, Mr. Lewis.

02:13:08.977 --> 02:13:11.249
I will clear you outta here.

02:13:14.422 --> 02:13:17.428
Mr. Lewis I now sentence you to life

02:13:21.336 --> 02:13:24.208
without the possibility of parole.

02:13:25.477 --> 02:13:28.817
I- (crowd chattering)

02:13:31.189 --> 02:13:33.927
This is a person's life as well.

02:13:35.798 --> 02:13:40.107
I can only hope and pray that you get the help that you need

02:13:42.078 --> 02:13:45.751
because you will have a lifetime to get it.

02:13:47.088 --> 02:13:48.023
Case close.

02:14:10.567 --> 02:14:12.872
- What's up China? - What's up?

02:14:12.872 --> 02:14:16.946
- I'm good. How you doing? - I'm good. Be careful.

02:14:20.587 --> 02:14:25.597
(peaceful music) (storm crackling)

02:14:32.545 --> 02:14:37.555
