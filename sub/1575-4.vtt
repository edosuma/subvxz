00:02.208 --> 00:05.709
Right now, the height
of bird-watching season,

00:05.792 --> 00:07.750
there's no place
I'd rather be, buddy.

00:07.834 --> 00:09.375
Hundred percent, pal.

00:09.458 --> 00:12.125
Klaus invited me to his
black-belt ceremony today.

00:12.208 --> 00:13.458
Told him to stuff it.

00:13.542 --> 00:15.709
Whoa! A common
brown-breasted brownbird!

00:15.792 --> 00:17.875
You think that's cool?
Check your six!

00:17.959 --> 00:20.834
Two common
brown-breasted brownbirds!

00:20.917 --> 00:24.458
And coming in slow from
the east, eight more CBBBs!

00:24.542 --> 00:26.834
And a crow!
And a blue jay!

00:26.917 --> 00:30.083
And a Russian spy satellite
falling through the atmosphere!

00:30.166 --> 00:33.417
It struck a blimp!
The blimp is out of control!

00:33.500 --> 00:36.417
The blimp is careening
towards the power plant!

00:37.583 --> 00:38.917
Birds, Steve.

00:39.000 --> 00:40.417
A pigeon!

00:42.417 --> 00:45.375
A scarlet tanager!

00:45.458 --> 00:47.417
The one
we've been waiting for.

00:47.500 --> 00:49.542
Truly a precious moment.

00:52.375 --> 00:53.667
What the --

00:53.750 --> 00:56.500
Is that man stealing
those bird eggs?

00:59.166 --> 01:00.792
Quick, we have to
follow him!

01:29.125 --> 01:32.750
Oh, my God. I frickin' sat
on an anthill again.

01:32.834 --> 01:34.625
There are ants
all over me.

01:34.709 --> 01:38.166
There are literally ants going
in and out of my dang mouth.

01:38.250 --> 01:40.000
Is there even
one on you?

bit me, Sarge!

You're gonna need

02:26.583 --> 02:28.792
Unh-unh. Unh-unh.

02:28.875 --> 02:30.083
He's got a gun!

02:30.166 --> 02:31.166
Get down!

02:31.250 --> 02:32.500
Run!!

02:32.583 --> 02:34.333
-I want my lawyer!
-Drop the gun now!

02:36.834 --> 02:39.375
I swear to God,
I will put you down!

02:39.458 --> 02:41.500
We saw a man
steal a bird egg.

02:42.792 --> 02:45.041
Get the
out of here!

02:45.125 --> 02:47.542
- Are you crazy?
- Get the out!

02:47.625 --> 02:50.709
And I think we'll need
to talk to your superior

02:50.792 --> 02:52.333
about that language.

02:54.125 --> 02:57.000
His language was even more
offensive than that other man's.

02:57.083 --> 02:58.875
Where are good citizens
supposed to go

02:58.959 --> 03:00.458
to report
egg-related crimes?

03:00.542 --> 03:02.083
Oh, you boys got
an egg problem?

03:02.166 --> 03:05.250
Go to the Oology Department
at Groff College.

03:05.333 --> 03:08.125
Ask for
Professor Elizabeth Hadley.

03:08.208 --> 03:11.500
She helped me identify a strange
egg I found on the bus.

03:11.583 --> 03:14.083
It was a Cadbury egg.

03:14.166 --> 03:16.875
Thank you. You've been
a very helpful prostitute.

03:16.959 --> 03:20.625
Prostitute?! How dare you!
I was doing insider trading!

03:20.709 --> 03:22.500
And I got that
on tape.

03:22.583 --> 03:25.709
You no-good kids
set me up!

03:25.792 --> 03:27.875
Wait'll I get
my hands on you!

03:27.959 --> 03:30.458
We gotta get out
of this police station!

03:33.041 --> 03:35.542
Ooh, two for one
on Jalapeño Beefers.

03:35.625 --> 03:37.750
That'd be a filling snack
for Steve and his friends

03:37.834 --> 03:39.417
after an afternoon
of roller-blading.

03:39.500 --> 03:41.041
Clip it.

03:41.125 --> 03:44.542
$1 off Bongiovanni brand
spaghetti sauce.

03:44.625 --> 03:47.709
"Zesty Italian" flavor.
Hmm.

03:47.792 --> 03:51.000
What if I bought this sauce?
It's a good deal.

03:51.083 --> 03:54.000
And it might taste good.

03:54.083 --> 03:58.208
"Zesty"?
It sounds a little...wild.

03:58.291 --> 04:00.083
But I like your old sauce

04:00.166 --> 04:01.750
with the ketchup
and the apple slices.

04:01.834 --> 04:05.166
I've made my decision.
We're trying the sauce.

04:11.667 --> 04:13.834
...and then,
he held up the egg

04:13.917 --> 04:16.291
and all the other men
had eggs, too.

04:16.375 --> 04:17.542
Tell her about
the ants, Steve.

04:17.625 --> 04:18.750
I'm not going to!

04:18.834 --> 04:20.250
It's good you came to me.

04:20.333 --> 04:23.000
The man you saw
is Commodore Francis Stoat.

04:23.083 --> 04:25.458
He leads a secret society
of hoarders

04:25.542 --> 04:28.625
who illegally collect
endangered bird eggs.

04:28.709 --> 04:30.583
They call themselves...

04:30.667 --> 04:33.750
the Order
of the Hand and Nest.

04:33.834 --> 04:35.333
People collect eggs?

04:35.417 --> 04:37.250
I want to show you both
something.

04:37.333 --> 04:39.500
Boy, people collect
everything these days.

04:39.583 --> 04:41.208
My cousin Ira
collects the panties

04:41.291 --> 04:43.083
of the different women
he's slept with.

04:43.166 --> 04:45.041
Isn't that dirty?
I think it's so dirty.

04:45.125 --> 04:47.875
Do you think that's a good idea
for a cousin, Steve?

04:49.500 --> 04:51.792
The Groff College
Egg Collection.

04:51.875 --> 04:54.333
We have to keep it
under such tight security

04:54.417 --> 04:56.709
because of the Order
of the Hand and Nest.

04:56.792 --> 04:58.625
They're always trying
to sneak in here.

04:58.709 --> 05:01.083
Just ask our air-conditioning
repairman. He knows.

05:01.166 --> 05:02.750
It's appalling.

05:02.834 --> 05:04.208
Exactly -- Wait!

05:04.291 --> 05:06.000
You're not our
air-conditioning repairman!

05:06.083 --> 05:07.625
That's our air-conditioning
repairman!

05:07.709 --> 05:09.166
Ha-ha!

05:10.375 --> 05:12.667
Damn it!
That's what I was talking about!

05:12.750 --> 05:15.834
It's why I've formed a group
of volunteer egg protectors.

05:15.917 --> 05:18.083
It's our goal
to thwart the Order o--

05:18.166 --> 05:20.875
Wait a minute. We don't even
have air conditioning!

05:20.959 --> 05:22.667
Ha-ha!

05:22.750 --> 05:24.709
Why are these people
so into eggs?!

05:24.792 --> 05:26.333
I mean,
they're just eggs.

05:26.417 --> 05:27.792
Everyone should be
into eggs.

05:27.875 --> 05:30.500
Nature's most elegant
structure.

05:30.583 --> 05:34.417
In here, all life begins,
and all life ends.

05:34.500 --> 05:36.583
I believe we go back
into an egg when we die,

05:36.667 --> 05:38.458
but where I choose
to protect the eggs,

05:38.542 --> 05:40.834
the Order desires
only to collect them.

05:40.917 --> 05:44.291
They have...
the egg madness!

05:44.375 --> 05:45.709
Egg madness?

05:45.792 --> 05:48.625
The overwhelming desire
to possess an egg.

05:48.709 --> 05:50.417
It's latent in all of us.

05:50.500 --> 05:53.959
The more we're around eggs,

05:54.041 --> 05:57.959
the more
we're likely to snap.

06:00.250 --> 06:01.875
I keep it under control,
though.

06:01.959 --> 06:03.250
I still don't get it.

06:03.333 --> 06:05.291
I don't get it, either.
I don't get...

06:05.375 --> 06:09.709
...how I ever lived without
these wonderful, wonderful eggs!

06:09.792 --> 06:11.041
Son of a bitch.

06:11.125 --> 06:13.709
I got the egg madness,
y'all!

06:18.000 --> 06:20.417
Ah, yes,
the ceremonial gong

06:20.500 --> 06:23.291
I got from ZGallery
has been banged.

06:24.750 --> 06:26.375
The Order of the Hand and Nest

06:26.458 --> 06:28.500
is happy to welcome
a new member.

06:28.583 --> 06:30.333
Sinjin St. John,

06:30.417 --> 06:34.208
retired maritime lawyer
and avid egg collector.

06:34.291 --> 06:37.959
Ooh. "Avid" is a
similar-sounding word

06:38.041 --> 06:41.041
to "ovum,"
which means egg.

06:41.125 --> 06:43.000
Yes. That was the joke.

06:49.250 --> 06:51.500
I have an egg.
Would you like to see it?

06:51.583 --> 06:53.500
You read my mind.

06:54.792 --> 06:58.417
Well, would you look at that.
I'm in hog heaven over here.

06:59.750 --> 07:01.291
A second gong?
Is that rare?

07:01.375 --> 07:04.667
-No, it happens every meeting.
-Ohh.

07:04.750 --> 07:07.542
Well, it still feels like
I should be right in front!

07:07.625 --> 07:11.583
Behold the egg
of the loggerhead shrike.

07:11.667 --> 07:15.083
Let the de-yolking
commence!

07:17.750 --> 07:19.000
Careful.

07:19.083 --> 07:21.208
Nice and easy.

07:21.291 --> 07:23.208
Slowly.

07:23.291 --> 07:24.667
Real careful-like.

07:24.750 --> 07:26.333
I know!

07:26.417 --> 07:27.834
Eyes on the egg!
Don't get distracted!

07:32.166 --> 07:34.583
The egg...

07:34.667 --> 07:37.166
is collected.

07:37.250 --> 07:39.583
Ohh.

07:39.667 --> 07:41.959
I know you all probably
need a second to reload,

07:42.041 --> 07:42.959
but I can go again.

07:43.041 --> 07:45.125
Not a brag, just a fact.

07:48.542 --> 07:52.000
Zesty Italian.
It's Bongiovanni brand.

07:53.000 --> 07:55.083
Just give it a try.

07:59.250 --> 08:01.083
Lot of herbs in there.

08:01.166 --> 08:03.166
I'll throw it away.

08:03.250 --> 08:05.417
No, no, no. No, no.
Be still.

So it's true.
You joined the Order.

09:16.667 --> 09:19.583
Oh! Steve, you just missed
everyone, you goose!

09:19.667 --> 09:22.709
I saw them. I saw everything.
Through the window.

09:22.792 --> 09:24.542
You should have tapped
on the glass.

09:24.625 --> 09:26.458
I would have passed you
a deviled egg.

09:26.542 --> 09:28.875
They were so good.
Though I've never had a bad one.

09:28.959 --> 09:30.917
-I'm mad at you, Roger!
-What?!

09:31.000 --> 09:33.959
These are the bad guys.
They steal eggs from birds!

09:34.041 --> 09:35.917
You used to care
about birds.

09:36.000 --> 09:38.041
And I still do.
Birds are great.

09:38.125 --> 09:41.041
Don't forget, birds are
where the eggs come from.

09:41.125 --> 09:43.834
Yes, but don't also
don't forget,

09:43.917 --> 09:46.250
eggs are where
the birds come from.

09:46.333 --> 09:47.917
Who cares about birds?!

09:48.000 --> 09:50.166
We did.
Come on, Roger,

09:50.250 --> 09:52.166
the tanagers
are still in the meadow.

09:52.250 --> 09:53.333
Pa-yuss.

09:53.417 --> 09:54.667
I won't just sit back

09:54.750 --> 09:56.667
and let you get away
with stealing eggs.

09:56.750 --> 09:58.625
I don't care about
your threats, Steve.

09:58.709 --> 10:01.000
I've got egg madness.
I'll do anything for an egg.

10:01.083 --> 10:03.458
What do you want me to do?
Kiss a man? I'll do it!

10:03.542 --> 10:05.834
The madness drives me
to do it, Steve!

10:05.917 --> 10:07.792
Get off my property!

10:07.875 --> 10:09.709
Commodore!

10:12.166 --> 10:13.959
I'm thrilled
you want to join

10:14.041 --> 10:16.166
the noble army of bird
defenders, Steve.

10:16.250 --> 10:20.667
Without further ado, I give
you...the Egg Protectors.

10:24.709 --> 10:27.000
Your water heater
is smoking!

10:27.083 --> 10:28.834
We almost died!

10:28.917 --> 10:30.667
Steve, I'd like to
introduce you to --

10:30.750 --> 10:32.125
I already know
these people.

10:32.208 --> 10:33.875
Hi, Mr. Tuttle,
Mr. Hooper, Buckle.

10:33.959 --> 10:36.667
Great. So, like I said,
we're a noble army of --

10:36.750 --> 10:39.208
Hello, Steve!
I'm sorry, he said hello,

10:39.291 --> 10:41.542
and where I come from --
-Shut up! There's no time!

10:41.625 --> 10:44.709
We have to stop the Order before
they snatch their next egg.

10:44.792 --> 10:47.750
And I have a hunch where
they might strike next.

10:47.834 --> 10:50.208
You guys know what rhymes
with "Thursday"?

10:51.792 --> 10:53.083
Nothing.

10:53.166 --> 10:55.875
It's Thursday Birdsday!

10:55.959 --> 10:58.291
Birdsday, of course!

10:58.375 --> 11:01.667
Oh, we have got a shit-ton
of birds loose in the studio,

11:01.750 --> 11:04.208
and our beefcake
animal handler, Scott,

11:04.291 --> 11:06.417
is showing us
his avian friends.

11:06.500 --> 11:07.875
And his chest!

11:13.333 --> 11:15.583
This bird is being weird.

11:15.667 --> 11:16.709
Ahh!

11:16.792 --> 11:19.709
She might be distressed.

11:19.792 --> 11:21.583
She has a nest of eggs
backstage.

11:21.667 --> 11:24.291
Backstage.

11:24.375 --> 11:26.250
Roger!

11:26.333 --> 11:29.375
Sir, there's a man in there
who's stealing the eggs!

11:29.458 --> 11:32.000
It's only birds
in this room, kid.

11:32.083 --> 11:35.250
Okay, lovebirds, lovely.
Avocet, beautiful.

11:35.333 --> 11:36.500
Mourning doves,
exquisite.

11:36.583 --> 11:37.792
A snake, kinda fat.

11:37.875 --> 11:39.083
Barn owl -- Hold on!

Haliaeetus Centurius,
the Century Eagle,

13:45.834 --> 13:51.709
has returned to its nesting
grounds on Skoal Island.

13:51.792 --> 13:53.667
Skull Island?!

Like where King Kong
comes from?

Oh.

Well, then, tell me more
about the egg.

14:04.917 --> 14:08.834
The Century Eagle only lays it
once every 100 years.

14:08.917 --> 14:11.250
It's the rarest egg
in the world.

14:11.333 --> 14:13.250
Hmm. Rarest.

14:13.333 --> 14:15.792
I think we should, and hear me

alerted the other Protectors.

a walkie-talkie?
