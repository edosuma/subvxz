WEBVTT

01:13.390 --> 01:14.023
This city.

01:15.189 --> 01:16.889
What can I tell you about the city?

01:17.889 --> 01:18.589
New York.

01:19.521 --> 01:21.055
A place where the men work hard

01:21.055 --> 01:23.122
and the dames well,

01:23.122 --> 01:24.521
they do what it is they do.

01:25.755 --> 01:26.920
The lively city hides

01:26.920 --> 01:28.588
the underbelly that runs

01:28.588 --> 01:29.221
through the gutters

01:29.221 --> 01:30.454
and the smoke filled streets.

01:31.387 --> 01:32.621
That's where I come into play.

01:33.620 --> 01:36.020
My name is Detective Sal Pelletier,

01:36.020 --> 01:38.353
when I tell you I seen it all.

01:39.286 --> 01:42.386
I mean, I seen it all, from

01:43.686 --> 01:43.985
the mobsters to the whores,

01:43.985 --> 01:45.419
the crooked bankers to the killers

01:45.419 --> 01:46.652
that hide in the shadows,

01:46.652 --> 01:47.551
waiting to strike

01:47.551 --> 01:49.051
when an opportunity appears.

01:50.418 --> 01:51.651
Sometimes I look out of

01:51.651 --> 01:52.884
my window at this city

01:53.851 --> 01:55.317
and then I look up at the sky

01:55.317 --> 01:56.984
and I see dark clouds,

01:56.984 --> 02:00.050
and all I can think is that God himself

02:00.050 --> 02:01.283
is trying to hide this city

02:01.283 --> 02:02.350
from his own eyes.

02:03.550 --> 02:04.083
Oh, yeah,

02:05.150 --> 02:06.583
I seen it all, alright.

02:08.249 --> 02:10.449
But tonight's story doesn't take place

02:10.449 --> 02:12.615
in some mobster's warehouse

02:12.615 --> 02:14.648
or some rundown bar

02:14.648 --> 02:15.815
full of the unfortunates

02:15.881 --> 02:16.781
of this great city.

02:17.781 --> 02:19.048
Our story takes place

02:19.048 --> 02:20.381
in the suburbs of New York,

02:21.214 --> 02:23.579
a nice street, a middle-class

02:23.579 --> 02:25.447
household with a perfect lawn

02:25.447 --> 02:28.146
and perfectly respectable residents.

02:29.079 --> 02:30.478
But as we know all too well,

02:31.313 --> 02:32.646
darkness can hide

02:32.646 --> 02:33.978
in the lightest of places.

02:35.412 --> 02:37.212
So let me tell you about Veronica.

02:38.078 --> 02:39.545
Veronica, Smart.

02:39.545 --> 02:41.845
Beautiful, intelligent,

02:42.611 --> 02:44.111
but with a life that will be anything

02:44.111 --> 02:45.178
but respectable.

02:46.377 --> 02:48.110
Veronica was married to Cliff see.

02:48.810 --> 02:49.610
They met when they were

02:49.610 --> 02:50.942
just college sweethearts.

02:51.910 --> 02:53.410
He'd done all right for himself

02:54.076 --> 02:55.709
up in the high rises of work

02:56.343 --> 02:58.042
with a love of a good woman at home.

02:59.109 --> 03:01.142
But temptation can hide around

03:01.142 --> 03:02.842
any corner of this great city.

03:03.508 --> 03:04.042
And Cliff.

03:05.108 --> 03:06.441
Well, Cliff had succumbed

03:06.441 --> 03:07.675
to the ways of a woman

03:07.675 --> 03:08.674
who wasn't his wife.

03:10.041 --> 03:12.207
So that's where we meet them.

03:13.207 --> 03:14.240
That's where we meet her.

03:14.907 --> 03:16.007
Veronica Smart.

03:17.140 --> 03:21.173
Welcome to the world of NOIR.

05:19.090 --> 05:23.523
I wish we could stay here all day,

05:24.256 --> 05:26.623
locked away in our own private heaven.

05:27.423 --> 05:29.289
Well, it certainly beats a cheap motel.

05:29.289 --> 05:29.922
I'll give you that.

05:30.422 --> 05:32.055
There is nothing wrong with a cheap motel

05:32.055 --> 05:33.522
for a quick getaway.

05:34.288 --> 05:35.522
It's got clean sheets

05:35.522 --> 05:37.688
and a firm mattress.

05:38.388 --> 05:39.221
As long as the water is hot

05:39.221 --> 05:40.388
and the shower works, then

05:40.987 --> 05:42.021
we don't need anything else.

05:42.954 --> 05:44.020
Oh, Cliff, you know, the sorts

05:44.020 --> 05:44.587
who check into an

05:44.587 --> 05:45.920
establishment like that,

05:46.353 --> 05:47.720
as my mother would say,

05:47.987 --> 05:49.586
they're not the respectable type.

05:49.853 --> 05:52.253
Well, we are here in the house

05:52.253 --> 05:53.186
perfectly respectable.

05:54.252 --> 05:55.252
Well, sadly,

05:55.252 --> 05:56.685
I've got to get back to work.

05:57.284 --> 05:59.552
My boss can be a real tyrant.

06:02.151 --> 06:04.451
Maybe if you ask him nicely

06:04.451 --> 06:05.984
he'll give you the day off.

06:05.984 --> 06:07.251
OK, Mr.

06:07.251 --> 06:08.884
Smart, please, may

06:08.884 --> 06:10.384
I take a leave of absence today?

06:11.083 --> 06:12.883
Of course Miss Layton,

06:12.883 --> 06:13.683
I'm sure you have

06:14.083 --> 06:16.316
important business to attend to.

06:16.316 --> 06:17.716
Very important and

06:18.449 --> 06:19.882
very respectable business.

06:20.949 --> 06:22.049
See, that's the problem.

06:22.982 --> 06:25.082
Nothing about this is respectable.

06:25.582 --> 06:27.148
The surroundings may be tasteful,

06:27.148 --> 06:28.248
but we both know.

06:29.214 --> 06:30.514
What we have is a good thing.

06:31.447 --> 06:33.181
A quick getaway to a motel,

06:33.547 --> 06:35.247
a few stolen moments in the office

06:35.247 --> 06:36.380
with the blinds closed.

06:37.647 --> 06:38.913
We can't do it anymore Cliff.

06:39.513 --> 06:40.080
Do what?

06:40.380 --> 06:41.879
Stop acting like a fool, Cliff.

06:41.879 --> 06:43.179
We both know that you're not.

06:43.479 --> 06:44.412
I'm a fool for you.

06:44.979 --> 06:47.245
It's not funny Cliff,

06:47.245 --> 06:49.212
nothing about this is funny.

06:49.645 --> 06:51.011
You mean so much to me.

06:51.845 --> 06:52.845
You know that, but

06:54.344 --> 06:56.211
I can't break a vow I made to my wife.

06:57.577 --> 06:58.710
I think you did already.

07:00.777 --> 07:02.177
I think we should end it now.

07:03.010 --> 07:04.510
You go back to being my boss.

07:05.043 --> 07:08.109
I go back to my life, auditions,

07:08.109 --> 07:10.142
and I can find somebody

07:10.142 --> 07:11.775
who loves me and only me.

07:12.775 --> 07:14.575
We can say hello,

07:14.575 --> 07:16.075
go for the occasional

07:16.075 --> 07:17.041
dinner with friends,

07:17.608 --> 07:21.141
but that's all it could be Cliff.

07:21.141 --> 07:21.941
I understand.

07:23.107 --> 07:23.707
I do.

07:24.874 --> 07:27.607
I know you deserve more, but Lana,

07:27.607 --> 07:29.306
I don't want to be without you.

07:30.640 --> 07:31.873
Cliff, did you hear that?

07:32.173 --> 07:32.439
What?

07:32.906 --> 07:34.239
Cliff thats the door.

07:34.239 --> 07:35.306
Someone's trying to come in.

07:36.006 --> 07:36.905
Get behind the door.

07:37.072 --> 07:38.339
What? The door.

07:38.339 --> 07:39.305
Get behind the door.

07:39.772 --> 07:41.338
I'm not hiding from your wife

07:41.338 --> 07:43.038
like I'm some sort of shameful secret.

07:43.071 --> 07:44.804
Sweetheart, you are a shameful secret.

07:44.804 --> 07:45.238
Lana, please.

07:48.804 --> 07:50.837
Working hard.

07:50.837 --> 07:51.303
I see.

07:51.303 --> 07:52.470
My dear husband.

07:52.870 --> 07:54.036
Sweetheart, baby.

07:54.036 --> 07:54.803
What are you doing at home?

07:54.836 --> 07:56.469
Well, I could ask you the same question,

07:57.436 --> 07:59.302
but I think you have to you, Mrs.

07:59.302 --> 07:59.636
Smart.

07:59.636 --> 08:00.902
I just came to drop something

08:00.902 --> 08:01.235
off to your.....

08:01.269 --> 08:03.169
Oh, so you are aware he's married.

08:03.835 --> 08:06.201
I did wonder whether you were clueless

08:07.035 --> 08:08.035
or just a whore.

08:08.801 --> 08:08.901
Mrs Smart,

08:08.901 --> 08:11.034
this has never happened before.

08:11.068 --> 08:11.601
I'm sorry.

08:11.901 --> 08:12.534
What's your name?

08:17.667 --> 08:17.933
It's Lana.

08:17.933 --> 08:19.166
Please don't look at me like that.

08:20.133 --> 08:21.399
We've all made mistakes,

08:21.399 --> 08:23.166
and I'm sure that you've made a few

08:23.166 --> 08:25.666
in your many years on the planet.

08:26.465 --> 08:28.065
Let me give you a word of advice,

08:28.065 --> 08:30.032
sweetheart, from me to you.

08:31.331 --> 08:32.865
Looks fade.

08:34.597 --> 08:36.164
I can see that, Mrs.

08:36.164 --> 08:36.764
Smart.

08:44.596 --> 08:45.363
Lana, maybe you should leave.

08:58.228 --> 08:59.594
Say something, anything.

08:59.594 --> 09:00.628
It's just...

09:00.628 --> 09:04.360
It's just what, what

09:04.360 --> 09:04.860
excuse are you going to throw at me?

09:04.960 --> 09:08.560
We were just talking, I miss talking.

09:09.160 --> 09:10.726
Feel like we don't do that anymore.

09:11.160 --> 09:12.326
You don't want to hear about me?

09:12.326 --> 09:13.259
Talk about us.

09:13.693 --> 09:14.992
It's all auditions

09:14.992 --> 09:16.725
or standing in line at some cattle call.

09:17.125 --> 09:18.459
So this is my fault

09:18.925 --> 09:20.625
because I have ambition?

09:21.058 --> 09:21.691
I messed up.

09:21.725 --> 09:22.391
That's on me.

09:22.991 --> 09:24.691
It's just sometimes you

09:25.491 --> 09:26.657
you feel so distant,

09:26.657 --> 09:28.424
like something I can see,

09:28.424 --> 09:29.957
but I just can't quite touch.

09:30.057 --> 09:32.157
That, is for the cheap roll in the hay.

09:32.323 --> 09:32.423
And that is for trying to put it on me.

09:32.423 --> 09:36.023
I've told you Cliff,

09:36.023 --> 09:38.389
I've told you for 16 years

09:38.656 --> 09:40.689
that this dame has ambition,

09:40.956 --> 09:42.889
that is what you married.

09:43.988 --> 09:46.155
Sweetheart, listen to me.

09:46.755 --> 09:48.655
I have been there for you.

09:48.688 --> 09:49.554
I've loved you.

09:51.521 --> 09:54.454
I've sdvoted my whole life to you.

09:54.920 --> 09:55.654
I know,

09:56.687 --> 09:58.620
I know, look, I'm crazy.

09:58.986 --> 10:00.353
I should be locked in a loony bin

10:00.353 --> 10:01.153
for what I just did.

10:01.853 --> 10:03.186
Well, what can I do to make this better?

10:03.253 --> 10:04.219
Well, I'm on my knees.

10:04.786 --> 10:05.886
A broken and sorry, man.

10:05.886 --> 10:07.152
Begging for your forgiveness.

10:07.185 --> 10:07.619
Get up.

10:08.685 --> 10:10.618
I can't stand weak.

10:11.451 --> 10:13.651
A cheap night is one thing, but weakness.

10:14.084 --> 10:16.384
That is something I won't accept.

10:19.817 --> 10:20.750
I can't bear to see

10:20.750 --> 10:22.150
the disappointment in your eyes.

10:24.283 --> 10:25.416
Men disappoint Cliff.

10:26.883 --> 10:28.083
It's who you are by nature.

10:28.449 --> 10:29.749
I shouldn't be surprised.

10:42.014 --> 10:49.613
What about the promises

10:49.613 --> 10:51.013
you made me, huh?

10:52.413 --> 10:55.446
You're 40, Veronica and still no baby?

10:55.446 --> 10:56.879
You son of a bitch!

10:57.612 --> 10:59.012
Maybe it's time to settle down

10:59.012 --> 11:00.312
and become a housewife.

11:00.345 --> 11:02.411
A mother, you know, a respectable job.

11:02.411 --> 11:04.144
A respectable job.

11:04.711 --> 11:06.144
It's not a job Cliff.

11:06.144 --> 11:06.378
What's so wrong about

11:06.378 --> 11:07.611
being a housewife or a mother.

11:08.177 --> 11:09.744
It's sure as hell a lot more respectable

11:09.744 --> 11:11.177
than this silly, childish dream.

11:11.977 --> 11:13.177
What did you just say?

11:15.176 --> 11:15.743
You heard

11:17.009 --> 11:18.376
and I ain't apologising for saying it.

11:21.176 --> 11:21.675
Goddamn Veronica.

11:21.775 --> 11:22.975
I thought this job at the school

11:22.975 --> 11:24.375
teaching art would make you happy,

11:24.375 --> 11:25.775
you seemed so excited.

11:26.775 --> 11:28.875
Firstly, I don't start

11:28.875 --> 11:31.008
until tomorrow, and secondly,

11:31.374 --> 11:33.040
the only reason I took

11:33.040 --> 11:34.640
this job was to get

11:34.640 --> 11:36.407
me out of this goddamn house.

11:36.907 --> 11:37.207
Oh.

11:37.807 --> 11:39.306
As well as giving you more time

11:39.306 --> 11:40.640
to bring your lady friends home.

11:40.740 --> 11:41.640
Do you think I ever wanted

11:41.640 --> 11:42.406
to be the kind of guy

11:42.406 --> 11:43.506
who stepped out on his lady?

11:43.806 --> 11:44.506
No.

11:44.506 --> 11:46.406
But Lana listens to me,

11:46.406 --> 11:48.005
she cares about what I have to say.

11:49.438 --> 11:50.138
Well that must have been

11:50.138 --> 11:51.072
wonderful for you.

11:52.271 --> 11:53.571
Look, I have things that I need.

11:55.638 --> 11:56.871
The guys are always asking,

11:56.871 --> 11:58.204
when are we going to welcome our own

11:58.204 --> 11:59.570
little bundle of joy in the world?

12:00.304 --> 12:01.404
What am I supposed to tell them?

12:02.570 --> 12:03.703
Where the hell are you going?

12:03.837 --> 12:06.503
I have come home to find you

12:06.803 --> 12:08.269
in bed with another woman,

12:08.836 --> 12:10.436
and yet somehow you've

12:10.436 --> 12:12.135
managed to make that my fault.

12:12.169 --> 12:13.569
I ain't blaming you, baby.

12:14.402 --> 12:15.235
Make friends with the

12:15.235 --> 12:15.968
spare bed tonight Cliff.

12:16.535 --> 12:19.534
I have a feeling

12:19.534 --> 12:20.034
you two are going to become very close.

12:20.201 --> 12:20.734
Take your filthy

12:20.734 --> 12:22.001
cheating hands off of me.

12:49.497 --> 12:51.764
Veronica, ain't the forgiving type.

12:51.764 --> 12:53.663
They say hell hath

12:53.663 --> 12:55.196
no fury like a woman scorned.

12:55.996 --> 12:57.463
Well, that saying

12:57.463 --> 12:58.329
could have been created

12:58.329 --> 12:58.363
for Veronica herself.

12:58.429 --> 12:58.796
So

13:00.062 --> 13:01.895
the next day, Veronica

13:01.895 --> 13:03.095
would start a new job

13:03.262 --> 13:06.628
teaching the kids in the ways of art.

13:06.628 --> 13:08.695
When she walkd in the door

13:08.695 --> 13:10.928
she sure as hell didn't look like

13:10.928 --> 13:12.394
no teacher I'd ever seen.

13:15.994 --> 13:16.960
Is that for me?

13:18.827 --> 13:19.327
Yeah.

13:20.760 --> 13:22.093
Good morning, class.

13:22.493 --> 13:24.892
My name is Veronica or Mrs.

13:24.892 --> 13:25.426
Smart.

13:25.892 --> 13:27.192
Good morning, Mrs.

13:27.192 --> 13:27.825
Smart.

13:28.559 --> 13:30.558
Now I'm here to teach you

13:30.892 --> 13:32.458
the beauty of the arts.

13:32.891 --> 13:34.458
She was a piece of work, all right.

13:35.191 --> 13:36.491
Jimmy was mesmerized.

13:37.157 --> 13:38.457
He was only one of a few.

13:39.391 --> 13:40.190
She could have been

13:40.190 --> 13:41.557
talking about anything,

13:41.557 --> 13:43.090
but he wouldn't hear a word.

13:46.123 --> 13:47.289
Who is this woman?

13:48.989 --> 13:50.056
She's like a real life

13:50.056 --> 13:51.256
movie star in front of me.

13:52.689 --> 13:53.755
I can't concentrate.

13:54.755 --> 13:55.555
I think she knows

13:55.555 --> 13:56.488
that I'm staring at her,

13:56.488 --> 13:57.455
but I can't look away.

13:58.855 --> 14:00.721
It's like somebody pinned my eyes open

14:00.721 --> 14:01.888
in only her direction.

14:03.554 --> 14:05.820
Her legs, her breasts.

14:06.520 --> 14:07.987
The lashings of red lipstick

14:07.987 --> 14:09.120
illuminating this gray

14:09.120 --> 14:10.186
and drab classroom.

14:11.953 --> 14:12.786
I'm aroused.

14:14.419 --> 14:19.252
I can't let her see.

14:19.252 --> 14:21.118
Of course, she saw that.

14:22.985 --> 14:24.085
S he's smiling.

14:24.318 --> 14:25.784
Shit, she saw me.

14:27.317 --> 14:28.617
Who is this woman?

14:29.417 --> 14:30.950
And James, isn't it?

14:30.950 --> 14:31.017
What? Oh, yeah, James.

14:31.017 --> 14:31.084
Well, Jimmy, OK, Jimmy,

14:31.984 --> 14:42.715
what kind of art excites you?

14:44.848 --> 14:47.148
Well, I think that art is all around us.

14:47.748 --> 14:49.781
An old lady selling roses on the street.

14:51.081 --> 14:53.214
Rain on a humid day.

14:55.547 --> 14:56.447
A beautiful woman.

14:57.480 --> 14:58.447
A beautiful woman.

14:59.147 --> 14:59.846
Of course,

15:01.113 --> 15:02.713
that might be the most exquisite

15:02.713 --> 15:04.213
work of art ever.

15:05.412 --> 15:06.412
Who is this woman?

15:07.046 --> 15:08.012
She's beautiful.

15:08.112 --> 15:09.112
She's confident.

15:10.045 --> 15:11.545
She's everything that a girl like me

15:11.545 --> 15:12.511
dreams of becoming.

15:13.711 --> 15:15.011
I want to stare at her.

15:16.044 --> 15:17.044
Like a gentleman would stare

15:17.044 --> 15:18.244
at an exquisite painting.

15:19.411 --> 15:20.544
Oh, look at her hair.

15:20.977 --> 15:23.277
Her long hair that cascades down her back

15:23.277 --> 15:26.310
blonde, no golden.

15:27.343 --> 15:28.243
I want to know her.

15:29.109 --> 15:30.509
I want her to know me.

15:31.576 --> 15:32.642
Who is this woman?

15:33.742 --> 15:36.242
And Vivian, isn't it?

15:36.508 --> 15:37.775
Yeah, I'm Vivian.

15:38.475 --> 15:39.241
OK, Vivian.

15:39.741 --> 15:41.308
So what kind of art do you like?

15:41.574 --> 15:42.707
Vivian's art is about

15:42.707 --> 15:44.007
as interesting as her.

15:44.807 --> 15:46.340
You think it's OK to berate

15:46.340 --> 15:47.973
a woman in front of her class?

15:48.673 --> 15:50.040
Now, let me tell you something.

15:50.506 --> 15:51.740
There's only one thing

15:51.740 --> 15:53.506
this world hates more than a crook.

15:54.039 --> 15:55.906
And that is a bully.

15:56.472 --> 15:58.572
Why don't you apologize

15:58.572 --> 15:59.972
to Miss Pierce here and pray

15:59.972 --> 16:01.072
she's understanding

16:01.072 --> 16:02.038
enough to forgive you.

16:03.671 --> 16:04.605
Sorry, Vivian.

16:05.571 --> 16:06.304
It's OK.

16:07.404 --> 16:09.171
Now, Vivien,

16:09.171 --> 16:11.237
what kind of art do you like?

16:11.737 --> 16:13.003
Oh, Vivian's just kooky

16:13.003 --> 16:14.137
for the movie pictures.

16:14.537 --> 16:16.170
Oh, hi, I'm Betty.

16:16.170 --> 16:17.636
I'm Vivian's best friend.

16:17.836 --> 16:20.136
Well, it's lovely to meet you, Betty.

16:20.702 --> 16:23.669
So, Vivian, the movie pictures?

16:23.702 --> 16:24.202
Yeah,

16:25.235 --> 16:26.002
but it's a world

16:26.168 --> 16:27.935
so far away from us, ordinary people,

16:27.935 --> 16:30.501
that I'll never get to experience that.

16:31.101 --> 16:32.467
And why do you think that?

16:32.834 --> 16:34.134
Because we're nobody.

16:34.434 --> 16:36.200
Well, I don't believe that's true at all.

16:37.400 --> 16:38.733
Now, it's my understanding

16:38.733 --> 16:40.033
that your previous teacher

16:40.233 --> 16:42.133
gave you all the picture of a famous

16:42.133 --> 16:43.233
painting to discuss.

16:43.333 --> 16:44.599
So why don't we start there?

16:44.899 --> 16:45.532
OK.

16:45.599 --> 16:47.066
Well, I guess I just don't see it.

16:47.066 --> 16:48.365
Don't see what?

16:48.365 --> 16:50.298
Well it's nice I guess.

16:50.298 --> 16:51.298
but it's kind of simple.

16:51.432 --> 16:52.565
Why is it so famous

16:52.565 --> 16:54.231
when many people can draw this way?

16:54.565 --> 16:56.064
You think you could do an oil

16:56.064 --> 16:58.131
painting like Thomas Hart Benton?

16:58.197 --> 16:59.564
I'm not saying that I could,

16:59.797 --> 17:01.097
but I know others who could.

17:01.964 --> 17:03.897
Now, does anybody else have an opinion

17:04.196 --> 17:05.195
on the painting?

17:06.329 --> 17:07.363
It feels cold.

17:08.729 --> 17:10.162
The towering skyscrapers

17:10.162 --> 17:11.296
below a darkened sky.

17:12.628 --> 17:13.762
The American flag

17:13.762 --> 17:14.929
blowing in the wind, but

17:16.262 --> 17:17.162
the colors are muted.

17:18.560 --> 17:20.261
I like the way it feels stationary

17:20.594 --> 17:21.560
like the moment froze

17:21.560 --> 17:23.127
and he painted that way.

17:23.127 --> 17:24.961
It seems bleak, though,

17:24.961 --> 17:26.260
but at the same time

17:26.294 --> 17:27.294
saying that the artist

17:27.294 --> 17:28.260
was seeing things that way.

17:29.327 --> 17:29.893
Yeah.

17:31.160 --> 17:31.493
Yeah.

17:31.493 --> 17:33.159
Like he at that moment, maybe

17:33.926 --> 17:36.559
wanted to change or was battling

17:36.559 --> 17:37.692
something within himself.

17:38.025 --> 17:39.125
It shows that behind

17:39.125 --> 17:40.725
the beauty of the city is a danger.

17:41.525 --> 17:42.492
Maybe not everything

17:42.492 --> 17:43.425
is as it appears to be.

17:45.391 --> 17:49.657
Jimmy, Vivian, that was beautifully put.

18:03.055 --> 18:05.855
Jimmy, Jimmy, you got to light?

18:08.188 --> 18:09.155
Yeah, sure.

18:13.121 --> 18:14.287
You know, I really enjoyed

18:14.287 --> 18:15.154
your class today.

18:16.320 --> 18:17.287
It's nice to have a teacher

18:17.287 --> 18:18.387
that knows about the subject

18:18.387 --> 18:19.120
that they're teaching.

18:19.320 --> 18:20.853
Well, thank you very much.

18:21.886 --> 18:24.019
You know, you seem to understand

18:24.019 --> 18:25.452
it quite well yourself.

18:26.052 --> 18:27.885
Well, when you spend a lot of time alone,

18:29.119 --> 18:30.085
gives you time to read.

18:31.185 --> 18:32.485
Jimmy, can I say something?

18:32.951 --> 18:33.318
Sure.

18:34.451 --> 18:35.818
Your eye for the arts

18:35.818 --> 18:38.384
is really rather extraordinary.

18:39.251 --> 18:41.084
You seem to see things like somebody...

18:41.117 --> 18:41.584
Older?

18:41.917 --> 18:43.050
Older, yes.

18:43.583 --> 18:44.850
Comforts me, honestly.

18:45.983 --> 18:46.950
Sometimes I think

18:46.950 --> 18:48.116
the real world can seem so.

18:48.116 --> 18:50.449
grey, so...

18:50.449 --> 18:53.815
Noisy? Yeah.

18:54.715 --> 18:56.082
Yeah, exactly.

18:56.148 --> 18:59.048
But well, if you look at a painting

18:59.048 --> 19:00.948
like Van Gogh's Cafe

19:00.948 --> 19:02.181
Terrace at Night, well,

19:03.447 --> 19:07.047
colours the soothing yet

19:07.514 --> 19:09.547
vibrant feelings that it gives you.

19:11.646 --> 19:13.013
Well, that's my escapism.

19:14.213 --> 19:16.246
What got you into art Jimmy?

19:16.246 --> 19:16.812
My mother.

19:18.312 --> 19:19.245
I was just a kid.

19:19.945 --> 19:20.545
I remember her

19:20.545 --> 19:21.645
sat in the kitchen painting,

19:23.645 --> 19:24.711
she used to always say that

19:24.711 --> 19:26.311
the light in the kitchen was perfect,

19:26.311 --> 19:28.511
and you must have good natural light.

19:30.477 --> 19:31.910
I'd sit and watch her for hours.

19:33.310 --> 19:34.010
I'd look at the bliss

19:34.010 --> 19:35.610
on her face like she just

19:36.843 --> 19:37.476
vanished.

19:38.643 --> 19:40.043
Into her own magical world.

19:41.409 --> 19:42.709
Well, you know, maybe that's something

19:42.709 --> 19:45.142
you should take up for yourself.

19:45.742 --> 19:47.008
Live your passion.

19:47.008 --> 19:47.941
I said, I loved art,

19:48.375 --> 19:49.675
I didn't say I could paint,

19:49.675 --> 19:51.241
and trust me, I can't.

19:51.774 --> 19:55.074
Plus guys like me from this place.

19:57.507 --> 19:58.240
Well art exactly ain't In my future.

19:59.507 --> 20:00.373
Where is your mother?

20:01.473 --> 20:03.106
She skipped out on us when I was little,

20:03.106 --> 20:04.373
so I got stuck with him.

20:07.172 --> 20:09.239
God, I'm sorry, it's your first day

20:09.239 --> 20:10.938
here, and I'm troubling you with my woes.

20:11.638 --> 20:12.838
I found my husband in bed

20:12.838 --> 20:14.138
with another woman last night.

20:19.504 --> 20:20.337
I'm sorry. I.

20:20.337 --> 20:23.103
I don't know why I told you that.

20:26.970 --> 20:27.536
You know,

20:29.136 --> 20:30.969
you're not like the women around here.

20:31.269 --> 20:32.369
Jimmy, Jimmy.

20:33.002 --> 20:34.202
Hey, Jimmy, you ready to go?

20:34.402 --> 20:35.502
Yeah, sure. I'm just talking to Mrs.....

20:35.502 --> 20:35.902
Have you seen Vivian?

20:35.902 --> 20:38.468
Not since class,

20:38.468 --> 20:39.535
oh wait here she comes, control yourself.

20:39.535 --> 20:41.734
Vivian you look as beautiful

20:41.734 --> 20:42.201
as a bright summers day.

20:42.201 --> 20:44.034
Shut up Riff.

20:44.034 --> 20:44.901
Mrs Smart .

20:45.067 --> 20:46.700
I really enjoyed your class today.

20:46.734 --> 20:48.000
It was very uplifting.

20:48.033 --> 20:49.067
Uplifting?

20:49.067 --> 20:50.966
Well, thank you very much, Betty.

20:51.266 --> 20:52.033
Umm Mrs. Smart.

20:52.333 --> 20:53.166
Can I just say that?

20:53.233 --> 20:53.799
Wow.

20:54.299 --> 20:55.732
You look like a movie star.

20:56.199 --> 20:58.132
Well, so I've been told.

20:58.132 --> 21:00.232
Actually I am an actress.

21:00.498 --> 21:02.465
What, like in the movies?

21:02.498 --> 21:03.098
Sure.

21:03.431 --> 21:05.031
Well, only a few small roles,

21:05.031 --> 21:07.231
but I have done many plays.

21:07.631 --> 21:10.164
One critic once called me dazzling.

21:10.331 --> 21:12.164
Dazzling. Wow.

21:12.497 --> 21:14.363
That's my dream, to be somebody

21:14.363 --> 21:15.563
that people talk about

21:15.596 --> 21:16.930
my face on the big screen.

21:17.196 --> 21:20.163
You would look magnificent Vivian,

21:20.163 --> 21:20.263
a real bombshell.

21:20.296 --> 21:21.796
Oh, you really think so, Riff?

21:21.796 --> 21:22.696
Sure thing.

21:22.696 --> 21:23.462
Well, you know,

21:23.462 --> 21:25.129
I was actually thinking about

21:25.529 --> 21:26.395
perhaps teaching,

21:26.395 --> 21:28.728
acting to people like you, young people

21:28.728 --> 21:30.728
who you want to make it in the movies.

21:31.094 --> 21:32.228
Oh, this is smart.

21:32.228 --> 21:33.527
I mean, I would love that.

21:33.661 --> 21:34.827
Well, money.

21:34.894 --> 21:36.360
My mother. Oh, baby.

21:36.360 --> 21:38.427
And I wouldn't dream of charging.

21:39.093 --> 21:40.560
Everybody deserves a shot.

21:40.826 --> 21:41.293
Oh, Mrs.

21:41.293 --> 21:42.626
Smart, then I would love to.

21:42.793 --> 21:43.626
Oh, you have no idea

21:43.626 --> 21:44.693
how happy this makes me.

21:46.126 --> 21:46.626
How about you, Jimmy?

21:46.626 --> 21:49.692
You have a face the camera would love.

21:51.092 --> 21:51.592
Really?

21:52.925 --> 21:53.825
Well, I don't know

21:53.825 --> 21:55.558
about all that acting stuff, but

21:56.391 --> 21:57.991
I'd sure love to sit and listen to

21:57.991 --> 21:58.757
you talk about it.

21:59.457 --> 22:00.291
Can I come, too?

22:00.524 --> 22:02.290
I'm a real movie picture fan, you know.

22:02.357 --> 22:03.923
Oh, well, sure.

22:03.957 --> 22:05.823
Well, this sounds like a plan.

22:06.023 --> 22:07.923
So why don't we say my place

22:07.923 --> 22:09.923
tomorrow night, say 7:00?

22:10.089 --> 22:11.289
What will your husband say?

22:11.422 --> 22:12.522
Well, he's working

22:12.522 --> 22:13.822
very late tomorrow night,

22:13.822 --> 22:16.022
so we'll have the place to ourselves.

22:16.055 --> 22:17.955
Well, I will be there with bells on.

22:18.221 --> 22:20.288
Oh, maybe you could show me

22:20.388 --> 22:21.788
how to make my hair like yours.

22:22.254 --> 22:26.554
I think I would trade

22:26.554 --> 22:28.154
in my best friend to look like you.

22:28.154 --> 22:29.387
Wait, What? Vivian Pierce, where are you?

22:29.387 --> 22:30.653
Great! Mother.

22:30.953 --> 22:32.286
I was just talking to Mrs.

22:32.286 --> 22:32.653
Smart.

22:32.686 --> 22:33.819
She's my new teacher

22:33.819 --> 22:35.486
and she's an actress.

22:35.886 --> 22:37.386
It's lovely to meet you.

22:38.352 --> 22:39.519
Charmed, I'm sure.

22:40.885 --> 22:41.852
Now, Vivian, Betty

22:41.852 --> 22:42.818
let's go

22:42.818 --> 22:44.385
we're having an early supper tonight

22:44.385 --> 22:45.218
before your father heads

22:45.218 --> 22:47.184
off to work late, again.

22:47.518 --> 22:48.351
Mrs Smart .

22:48.917 --> 22:50.551
I can't wait for us to begin our lessons.

22:53.983 --> 22:54.883
Mrs. Smart.

22:56.750 --> 22:57.450
Boys.

23:02.282 --> 23:04.215
I don't think she liked me very much.

23:04.815 --> 23:06.082
She doesn't like anybody,

23:06.415 --> 23:11.114
including her own husband.

23:11.114 --> 23:15.181
Poor schlep.

23:15.181 --> 23:16.214
I'd always had problems

23:16.214 --> 23:17.480
in the neighborhood where kids

23:17.480 --> 23:18.747
like Jimmy and Riff lived.

23:19.513 --> 23:20.447
It wasn't the safest

23:20.447 --> 23:21.613
of places in the town.

23:22.013 --> 23:24.446
Poverty was the word of the day,

23:24.446 --> 23:26.112
the kind of place the rest of the town

23:26.112 --> 23:27.512
looked down on like a blemish

23:28.179 --> 23:29.045
that wouldn't go away.

23:29.879 --> 23:31.178
I think she looked at me today.

23:31.645 --> 23:32.745
Who? Vivian.

23:33.212 --> 23:34.411
I swear she did, Jimmy.

23:34.411 --> 23:35.145
She looked round

23:35.245 --> 23:37.044
and for a moment, our eyes connected.

23:37.144 --> 23:38.711
I think you see what you want to see.

23:39.011 --> 23:40.511
Trust me, I've known her for years.

23:40.511 --> 23:41.610
You've known for years.

23:41.977 --> 23:42.844
When has she ever shown

23:42.844 --> 23:44.177
any interest in a guy like you?

23:44.210 --> 23:45.410
What do you mean a guy like me?

23:45.443 --> 23:46.576
What kind of crack is that?

23:46.576 --> 23:47.910
No crack. It's cool.

23:47.910 --> 23:49.709
It's just... It's just what?

23:49.709 --> 23:50.543
Come on Riff,

23:50.543 --> 23:51.742
you've been loopy for Vivian

23:51.742 --> 23:52.642
since we were 10 years

23:52.642 --> 23:53.775
old, it's time to move on.

23:53.875 --> 23:55.309
Go swivel Jimmy.

23:56.508 --> 23:57.942
Pair of aces.

23:59.675 --> 24:02.874
Damn it, man.

24:02.874 --> 24:04.007
I can't concentrate.

24:04.241 --> 24:06.007
My mind feels like cotton candy.

24:06.374 --> 24:08.040
I mean, it wasn't just me, right?

24:08.773 --> 24:09.573
Mrs Smart is...

24:09.573 --> 24:10.773
A babe?

24:10.773 --> 24:11.440
A doll?

24:11.440 --> 24:13.440
Yeah, but it's more than that,

24:13.440 --> 24:14.539
before you turned up

24:14.539 --> 24:15.473
we were really talking.

24:16.872 --> 24:17.206
Man.

24:17.272 --> 24:18.539
She's like a hundred?

24:18.705 --> 24:19.972
No, Jesus.

24:19.972 --> 24:21.905
She's like 40 I bet.

24:21.905 --> 24:22.805
That's a woman who's

24:22.805 --> 24:23.838
seen a lot of things.

24:23.871 --> 24:24.271
Yeah.

24:24.405 --> 24:26.204
Like the backseat in many a Chevrolet.

24:26.238 --> 24:27.304
Hey don't talk that way.

24:28.904 --> 24:30.837
You shouldn't talk that way about a lady.

24:31.204 --> 24:33.837
She's taken Jimmy,

24:33.837 --> 24:34.670
did you not see the rock on her finger,

24:34.670 --> 24:36.636
He's a deadbeat, he cheats on her?

24:36.936 --> 24:38.470
Wait she told you this?

24:38.503 --> 24:40.136
Yeah, I told you we talked.

24:41.169 --> 24:41.536
Damn it.

24:41.536 --> 24:42.836
I can't wait to see her tomorrow.

24:42.936 --> 24:45.869
Oh you are lost to the darkside

24:45.869 --> 24:46.702
my friend. Darkside?

24:46.968 --> 24:47.835
Women.

24:47.835 --> 24:48.502
And Vivien?

24:48.768 --> 24:49.968
It's Destiny.

24:53.434 --> 24:55.867
Seeing her today just made me realise

24:56.001 --> 24:57.167
girls, they don't know anything

24:57.167 --> 24:59.267
about life, love,

25:00.567 --> 25:01.866
sex... Sex.

25:02.000 --> 25:02.700
You think you're going to be

25:02.700 --> 25:04.166
playing backseat bingo with her?

25:04.166 --> 25:05.299
No, you clown.

25:05.299 --> 25:05.966
I'm just saying that

25:05.966 --> 25:07.066
today opened my eyes.

25:07.066 --> 25:07.799
I mean, come on.

25:08.765 --> 25:10.032
She's like something from a movie.

25:10.799 --> 25:12.098
Well, Jimmy, as much fun

25:12.098 --> 25:13.565
as it is, I really got to go.

25:13.598 --> 25:14.631
I'm going to miss the best time.

25:14.665 --> 25:15.065
Riff,

25:16.198 --> 25:17.464
I can speak to my old man.

25:18.431 --> 25:19.831
See if you can stay with us.

25:19.831 --> 25:20.731
You don't deserve to

25:20.731 --> 25:21.697
be out on the street.

25:21.697 --> 25:22.530
You got to be able to...

25:22.530 --> 25:23.697
I know, Jimmy, you've

25:23.697 --> 25:24.763
given me the same speech

25:24.763 --> 25:25.463
since the funeral.

25:25.463 --> 25:26.996
But I'm fine. Really?

25:27.263 --> 25:28.729
I got everything under control.

25:28.763 --> 25:30.563
Yeah, but I got this, Jimmy.

25:32.629 --> 25:34.695
Sleeping down the docks again tonight?

25:34.695 --> 25:36.795
Yeah, I found this great old building.

25:37.062 --> 25:38.562
I share it with like 300 bats.

25:38.628 --> 25:39.095
Shut up.

25:39.361 --> 25:39.795
You hear that?

25:41.861 --> 25:42.961
Oh, shit.

25:42.961 --> 25:44.261
My dad's home. Jimmy!

25:45.594 --> 25:46.594
So this is what happens

25:46.594 --> 25:47.294
when I'm not here?

25:47.527 --> 25:47.960
No.

25:49.093 --> 25:49.260
You just thought you would

25:49.260 --> 25:50.593
steal my cigarettes

25:50.793 --> 25:51.693
and act like a big man

25:51.693 --> 25:52.493
when I ain't around.

25:53.426 --> 25:54.126
I should go.

25:54.126 --> 25:55.559
It's lovely to see you, Mr. Flynn.

25:55.559 --> 25:56.392
May I say you are looking

25:56.392 --> 25:57.592
particularly rugged today.

25:57.592 --> 25:57.826
Get out!

26:02.492 --> 26:03.325
I'm going to go to my room.

26:03.791 --> 26:04.191
Why?

26:05.758 --> 26:07.158
You scared of your old man?

26:08.291 --> 26:08.924
No, sir.

26:08.991 --> 26:09.524
I just.

26:09.524 --> 26:10.957
So you think you're a man now

26:10.957 --> 26:13.424
because you started smoking cigarettes?

26:14.557 --> 26:15.023
Go on.

26:16.190 --> 26:18.123
Show me how much of a man you really are.

26:18.123 --> 26:18.823
Leave me alone.

26:19.556 --> 26:21.123
You know, we should put a dress on you

26:21.123 --> 26:21.889
so anyone can see

26:21.889 --> 26:23.689
how much of a girl you are.

26:23.689 --> 26:24.355
Look at you,

26:25.755 --> 26:27.055
you dress like some rebel

26:27.588 --> 26:28.555
but you,

26:29.021 --> 26:29.988
you're as soft as a newborn

26:29.988 --> 26:30.955
babies backside.

26:34.621 --> 26:35.587
Oh, wait.

26:35.587 --> 26:36.654
I need you down at the garage

26:36.720 --> 26:37.287
tomorrow night,

26:37.354 --> 26:39.220
we've got two cars coming in

26:39.220 --> 26:40.153
that need to be finished.

26:42.186 --> 26:42.520
Sure.

26:44.253 --> 26:46.519
Oh, no, I can't.

26:46.519 --> 26:47.519
I've already made plans.

26:49.152 --> 26:49.619
Plans?

26:50.185 --> 26:50.985
You don't have plans

26:50.985 --> 26:51.952
you're just a kid.

26:52.085 --> 26:53.152
I'm sixteen.

26:54.351 --> 26:54.951
I'm sorry, Dad,

26:54.951 --> 26:56.151
but I can't make it tomorrow.

26:56.918 --> 26:58.084
Oh, you will be there,

26:58.084 --> 27:00.517
or you can pack up your stuff

27:00.784 --> 27:02.517
and see how you do out there on the street

27:02.517 --> 27:03.317
Dad please.

27:03.317 --> 27:04.717
You are sixteen Jimmy,

27:05.383 --> 27:06.283
it's time to be a man

27:06.283 --> 27:07.483
and make an honest wage.

27:07.850 --> 27:08.550
You can't expect me

27:08.550 --> 27:09.683
to have you here living forever.

27:12.482 --> 27:14.515
Now, go to your room and stay there,

27:15.282 --> 27:15.882
I got a friend

27:15.882 --> 27:16.482
coming over tonight

27:16.482 --> 27:18.315
and I do not want to be disturbed.

27:18.315 --> 27:18.915
A woman?

27:20.581 --> 27:22.048
None of your goddamn business,

27:24.181 --> 27:25.481
you don't even know what a woman is.

27:28.347 --> 27:29.447
Now get out of my sight.

27:33.346 --> 27:35.013
Yes sir.

27:46.544 --> 27:47.744
At Vivian's house.

27:48.378 --> 27:49.811
Well, Vivian was brought up

27:49.811 --> 27:50.977
under the eyes of God,

27:51.544 --> 27:52.977
a devout kind of family,

27:53.010 --> 27:54.710
a cross on the wall

27:54.710 --> 27:56.277
and a Bible on the nightstand.

27:56.843 --> 27:58.710
But Vivian is a teenage girl

27:59.443 --> 28:00.909
starting to question things.

28:01.976 --> 28:02.909
I'm glad your mother

28:02.909 --> 28:04.209
let me stay over Vivian.

28:04.342 --> 28:05.975
Oh, me too.

28:05.975 --> 28:07.442
Plus, I know it's

28:07.442 --> 28:08.642
your father's cards night?

28:09.108 --> 28:11.008
His friends give me the heebie jeebies.

28:13.774 --> 28:15.641
Betty, do you think I could ever look

28:15.641 --> 28:16.740
like Veronica Smart?

28:17.307 --> 28:18.407
Vivian, you've not stopped

28:18.407 --> 28:20.073
talking about her since we left school.

28:20.107 --> 28:21.706
Sorry Betty, it's just

28:21.706 --> 28:23.106
I've only ever seen women

28:23.106 --> 28:23.906
like her in the pages

28:23.906 --> 28:25.239
of our celebrity magazine.

28:25.673 --> 28:27.639
Imagine a woman like that.

28:27.639 --> 28:29.405
Living right here in our town.

28:29.905 --> 28:31.672
You sound screwy Vivian Pierce.

28:31.972 --> 28:33.772
It's not like she's Lana Turner.

28:34.638 --> 28:36.638
Oh she was so perfect.

28:36.971 --> 28:38.638
OK, I'm officially ignoring you.

28:39.237 --> 28:40.337
Sorry, Betty.

28:40.704 --> 28:41.504
You are going to come to hers

28:41.504 --> 28:42.337
tomorrow, though, of course.

28:42.770 --> 28:43.704
No way.

28:44.004 --> 28:45.470
My mother would flip her wig.

28:45.770 --> 28:47.170
She thinks that actors

28:47.170 --> 28:48.003
are lower than whores.

28:48.570 --> 28:50.036
Her words, not mine.

28:50.403 --> 28:53.169
Well, I think your mother and my mother

28:53.202 --> 28:54.369
are the same person.

28:56.169 --> 28:57.735
I'm going to brush my teeth.

28:58.068 --> 28:59.401
It's spearmint!

29:01.568 --> 29:03.401
Oooh, I'm sorry Mrs Pierce.

29:05.634 --> 29:07.834
Now, Vivien, I need to talk to you.

29:08.467 --> 29:09.400
Am I in trouble?

29:10.067 --> 29:12.066
No, I'm worried about you.

29:12.066 --> 29:13.133
And so is your father.

29:13.200 --> 29:14.899
You come home from school and disappear

29:14.933 --> 29:15.966
so fast to your room

29:15.966 --> 29:17.299
that we barely get a hello.

29:17.699 --> 29:19.565
I'm fine, mother, honestly.

29:19.999 --> 29:21.099
It's just.

29:23.332 --> 29:24.265
Oh Vivian, it's just what?

29:25.998 --> 29:28.431
Well, when did you first start

29:28.431 --> 29:30.831
to get feelings for boys?

29:31.331 --> 29:33.564
You know, in the non friend way?

29:34.830 --> 29:35.897
Vivian, you are too young

29:35.897 --> 29:36.830
to be thinking about that.

29:36.863 --> 29:38.663
I'm fifteen mother, please.

29:39.529 --> 29:40.896
There is a time and place for a man

29:41.029 --> 29:42.396
and that time is not now.

29:43.396 --> 29:44.662
Do you want to end up like the neighbours

29:44.662 --> 29:46.629
daughter out all hours, drinking,

29:46.629 --> 29:47.395
cavorting around

29:47.395 --> 29:48.795
with every boy that looks at her?

29:48.862 --> 29:50.595
Sure sounds more fun than this.

29:51.195 --> 29:51.561
Look.

29:53.861 --> 29:55.061
I know I sound harsh,

29:55.494 --> 29:56.327
and I'm not saying

29:56.327 --> 29:56.927
that when you're older,

29:56.927 --> 29:58.394
you can't make your own choices,

29:58.394 --> 29:59.993
but I have to guide you now

29:59.993 --> 30:00.727
so those choices

30:00.727 --> 30:02.360
you make in the future are good ones.

30:02.793 --> 30:04.393
Worrying about boys and playing this

30:04.393 --> 30:05.393
kind of music is most

30:05.393 --> 30:06.593
certainly not a good one.

30:06.759 --> 30:08.426
It's just music, mother.

30:08.626 --> 30:09.792
I don't think Satan plans

30:09.792 --> 30:10.692
on coming through my record player

30:10.692 --> 30:11.659
to corrupt me.

30:12.658 --> 30:12.792
Vivian!

30:12.792 --> 30:14.058
You are not too old to be put over

30:14.058 --> 30:14.725
your father's knee.

30:14.891 --> 30:15.858
Sorry, mother.

30:18.358 --> 30:19.091
You just need to say

30:19.091 --> 30:20.091
your prayers before bed.

30:20.491 --> 30:21.224
Go to church.

30:21.557 --> 30:22.490
Study hard.

30:22.490 --> 30:24.323
And then you can think about a husband.

30:24.390 --> 30:26.690
But mother, if I'm too young to date,

30:26.690 --> 30:28.123
surely I'm too young to think

30:28.123 --> 30:28.823
about a husband.

30:29.056 --> 30:29.523
Vivian.

30:29.523 --> 30:30.856
Nobody likes a smart mouth.

30:30.856 --> 30:33.056
Now turn those records off

30:33.089 --> 30:34.422
It's time for bed for you two.

30:34.422 --> 30:36.789
Oh no, five more minutes mother, please.

30:38.055 --> 30:38.922
Fine.

30:39.555 --> 30:41.855
Five more minutes then bed.

30:41.855 --> 30:42.254
OK.

30:45.121 --> 30:47.387
Oh, sorry Mrs Pierce.

30:48.187 --> 30:49.920
Oh Vivian,

30:50.087 --> 30:51.220
I forgot to mention,

30:51.420 --> 30:52.520
I think I know who was going

30:52.520 --> 30:53.386
to ask you to the dance.

30:54.386 --> 30:55.186
Do you think she would let me

30:55.186 --> 30:56.286
try on one of her dresses?

30:56.519 --> 30:58.619
Oh, I bet she gets them from Europe.

30:59.119 --> 31:00.519
OK, good night, Vivian.

31:01.085 --> 31:02.352
Sorry, Betty.

31:05.518 --> 31:06.518
After catching Cliff

31:06.518 --> 31:08.018
and Lana in the sinful act,

31:08.451 --> 31:10.017
something in Veronica changed

31:10.617 --> 31:11.551
or maybe just brought

31:11.551 --> 31:12.817
the real her to the surface.

31:13.517 --> 31:15.883
Either way, the kids were so blinded

31:15.883 --> 31:17.316
by her, they wouldn't see anything

31:17.316 --> 31:18.883
the dame wouldn't allow them to see.

31:19.983 --> 31:21.149
It's the evening after

31:21.149 --> 31:22.616
and Cliff is away with work.

31:23.582 --> 31:25.749
Veronica, well Veronica

31:25.749 --> 31:27.648
is dressed like a goddamn lounge

31:27.648 --> 31:29.382
singer, wearing a bright red dress,

31:29.815 --> 31:32.581
showing off all her killer curves.

31:34.714 --> 31:36.514
Anybody order a group of street rats?

31:36.514 --> 31:38.414
Speak for yourself Riff Randall.

31:38.414 --> 31:39.613
I am so pleased you could all make it,

31:39.613 --> 31:40.847
come in.

31:41.013 --> 31:41.613
Woah!

31:41.647 --> 31:42.646
You've got a real nice

31:42.646 --> 31:44.013
pile of bricks here Mrs Smart.

31:44.013 --> 31:45.813
Oh, please call me Veronica.

31:45.813 --> 31:46.913
OK, Veronica.

31:47.212 --> 31:49.046
Now, who would like a drink,

31:49.079 --> 31:50.912
something to get this party started?

31:50.945 --> 31:51.812
Alcoholic?

31:51.879 --> 31:53.245
I won't tell anyone if you won't.

31:53.245 --> 31:54.945
Then I'll have a beer.

31:55.245 --> 31:56.145
How about you two?

31:56.145 --> 31:58.844
Oh, no, just a lemonade for me, please.

31:58.878 --> 31:59.811
Sure. You got whiskey?

32:00.111 --> 32:01.044
I do indeed.

32:01.044 --> 32:02.977
So I heard your old man

32:02.977 --> 32:03.844
is stepping out on you.

32:04.277 --> 32:04.910
Riff, Jesus.

32:04.943 --> 32:06.243
No, it's fine, honestly.

32:06.777 --> 32:07.776
Men are pigs.

32:07.776 --> 32:08.176
(Pig noises)

32:08.743 --> 32:09.709
Mrs. Smart?

32:09.709 --> 32:11.743
Um, I mean, Veronica,

32:12.009 --> 32:13.742
your dress is so magnificent.

32:13.976 --> 32:15.309
Oh, what? This old thing.

32:15.542 --> 32:17.608
Oh, I would love a dress like that.

32:17.942 --> 32:18.842
And your hair.

32:19.275 --> 32:20.975
How do you get it to look so glamorous?

32:21.675 --> 32:22.274
Vivian.

32:22.441 --> 32:25.741
Well, I think you have a beautiful face,

32:26.107 --> 32:28.740
stunning bone structure, and those eyes.

32:29.040 --> 32:30.740
They could melt the heart of a sailor.

32:30.840 --> 32:32.740
Oh, oh, oh.

32:33.073 --> 32:35.439
Ok Vivian, relax.

32:35.439 --> 32:36.906
I could relax you, Vivian.

32:36.906 --> 32:37.606
Ewww.

32:37.606 --> 32:40.239
Do I see a little love connection here?

32:40.305 --> 32:41.039
Flirtation?

32:41.239 --> 32:42.205
No, you do not.

32:42.338 --> 32:43.772
Riff has been trying to get me to go

32:43.772 --> 32:44.671
steady with him since

32:44.671 --> 32:45.838
we're six years old.

32:46.038 --> 32:47.371
He's not my type.

32:47.471 --> 32:49.338
Maybe you don't know what your type is.

32:49.937 --> 32:51.171
So how about you, Jimmy?

32:51.171 --> 32:53.504
You got a lady in your life?

32:53.970 --> 32:55.937
Girls my age aren't appealing to me.

32:56.970 --> 32:57.436
I'm going to wait

32:57.436 --> 32:59.136
till after high school to find my girl.

32:59.303 --> 32:59.936
I see.

33:00.203 --> 33:01.236
Can I get another drink?

33:01.469 --> 33:02.802
Oh, sure, help yourself.

33:02.936 --> 33:04.536
But just don't let your parents know

33:04.536 --> 33:05.835
I'm letting you drink liquor.

33:06.369 --> 33:07.069
Can I smoke?

33:07.135 --> 33:07.802
Sure.

33:08.302 --> 33:10.301
As long as I can bum one from you.

33:11.168 --> 33:12.934
Can I bum one also?

33:17.001 --> 33:25.566
Here, Vivian, let me light it for you.

33:25.566 --> 33:27.299
I think I'll save this for later.

33:27.932 --> 33:30.132
So, Jimmy, when you're alone,

33:30.532 --> 33:31.765
what is it you like to do?

33:33.598 --> 33:35.931
Listen to music, read books,

33:36.965 --> 33:37.664
play my guitar.

33:38.464 --> 33:39.298
Oh the guitar.

33:39.598 --> 33:40.697
I play the violin.

33:40.964 --> 33:42.797
Oh really, well the violin,

33:42.830 --> 33:45.197
the guitar, hell even the goddamn drums.

33:45.530 --> 33:47.030
I think it's all wonderful.

33:47.263 --> 33:49.263
Hey, Riff, turn up the music.

33:49.496 --> 33:50.829
Let's dance.

33:50.863 --> 33:52.063
What? Here, now?

33:52.362 --> 33:55.062
Here and now is all we have Jimmy Flynn.

33:56.362 --> 33:57.528
Veronica, Riff and Jimmy

33:57.528 --> 33:58.662
danced around the room.

33:59.462 --> 34:01.595
Veronica looked happy and the kids ate up

34:01.595 --> 34:03.194
that happiness with a silver spoon.

34:04.128 --> 34:05.294
Jimmy played it cool,

34:05.861 --> 34:07.360
leaning on the cabinet of trophys

34:07.360 --> 34:09.094
from her husband's college days.

34:09.793 --> 34:11.159
It's rude to stare, Jimmy.

34:11.193 --> 34:12.327
I'm sorry.

34:13.060 --> 34:14.393
The last man who stared at me

34:14.393 --> 34:15.759
that way, ended up laying

34:15.759 --> 34:18.159
beside me for the next 16 years.

34:18.559 --> 34:20.759
She got him!

34:20.759 --> 34:22.692
Oh, I'm so, so sorry.

34:22.692 --> 34:23.558
I'll clean all that up.

34:23.558 --> 34:24.824
It's fine, honestly.

34:24.925 --> 34:26.690
My husband, he breaks a lot of glasses.

34:26.891 --> 34:27.491
What's he doing?

34:27.491 --> 34:28.824
Throwing them around the house.

34:29.024 --> 34:31.956
In that moment, Veronica started to lie.

34:32.024 --> 34:33.590
Yeah. Sometimes he...

34:33.590 --> 34:35.657
He what?

34:35.657 --> 34:36.322
Never mind.

34:39.090 --> 34:40.789
Marriage is tough kids.

34:40.789 --> 34:43.289
You try so hard to

34:43.722 --> 34:45.188
to be the perfect housewife,

34:45.188 --> 34:46.188
and yet still it's

34:47.255 --> 34:48.355
it's never quite enough.

34:49.388 --> 34:52.121
He cheated, many times I suspect,

34:53.321 --> 34:54.721
he didn't even apologize.

34:54.721 --> 34:55.587
He just said that

34:56.687 --> 34:57.887
the man's got to do

34:58.420 --> 34:59.820
what a man's got to do.

35:00.787 --> 35:01.520
That's what he said.

35:03.120 --> 35:05.253
Listen to me bringing the party down.

35:05.786 --> 35:07.119
I'm so sorry whilst

35:07.119 --> 35:08.686
we are here in this house.

35:09.052 --> 35:10.885
Let's forget all the bad in our lives

35:10.885 --> 35:12.852
and just focus on the good.

35:13.385 --> 35:16.518
Oh, Veronica, I just wanted to ask,

35:16.618 --> 35:17.951
what movies have you starred in?

35:17.984 --> 35:19.951
Did you see Hunt for Love

35:20.284 --> 35:21.317
with Cary Grant?

35:21.651 --> 35:23.217
Oh, I love that movie.

35:23.317 --> 35:24.617
Well, I was the nurse

35:24.717 --> 35:26.583
who got him back to health.

35:26.583 --> 35:28.816
So you met him?

35:28.816 --> 35:30.883
Darling, met him? We're friends,

35:30.883 --> 35:32.483
we bonded over our love

35:32.483 --> 35:33.882
for the silent movies.

35:33.916 --> 35:34.782
Oh, Vivian.

35:35.149 --> 35:37.082
The stories I could tell you.

35:37.115 --> 35:38.782
Oh, I would love to hear them.

35:39.482 --> 35:42.281
So, Jimmy, you got a talent?

35:42.648 --> 35:43.814
Boosting cars?

35:43.814 --> 35:45.048
Mmm, a bad boy?

35:45.048 --> 35:46.114
I prefer rebel.

35:46.181 --> 35:47.081
You have ice?

35:47.081 --> 35:48.280
Sure it's in the kitchen.

35:48.314 --> 35:49.114
Help yourself.

35:49.114 --> 35:51.047
Vivian why don't you help

35:51.047 --> 35:52.280
Riff with the ice

35:52.280 --> 35:54.446
and maybe bring in some snacks?

35:54.913 --> 35:55.679
Sure thing.

35:55.979 --> 35:57.612
Veronica, why us?

35:58.712 --> 35:59.646
What do you mean Riff?

35:59.746 --> 36:01.379
Why would you want to be friends with us?

36:01.412 --> 36:01.679
I mean,

36:01.812 --> 36:03.612
you're a beautiful, wealthy woman.

36:03.812 --> 36:06.145
We're hardly your usual crowd.

36:06.945 --> 36:07.944
Honestly,

36:07.944 --> 36:10.677
I never really fit in around here.

36:12.211 --> 36:13.210
Housewives, they look

36:13.210 --> 36:16.243
at me like I'm trash and the men

36:16.243 --> 36:17.843
look at me with lustful eyes.

36:19.110 --> 36:19.543
I guess

36:20.709 --> 36:21.843
I just needed a change

36:21.843 --> 36:22.742
of energy around me.

36:27.042 --> 36:27.475
You know,

36:27.475 --> 36:28.908
you have a really neat set of records.

36:29.242 --> 36:29.908
Oh, thanks.

36:30.875 --> 36:32.808
My husband hates them of course.

36:33.374 --> 36:34.274
He's not really that big

36:34.274 --> 36:37.840
into the music or movies or art.

36:38.374 --> 36:39.407
He's a bit square when it comes

36:39.407 --> 36:40.074
to those things.

36:40.740 --> 36:41.540
You like this one?

36:42.607 --> 36:43.106
Sure.

36:50.172 --> 36:51.539
Tell me more about you, Jimmy.

36:53.738 --> 36:54.605
What do you want to know?

36:55.805 --> 36:56.405
Everything.

36:59.104 --> 37:00.871
Well, I'm 16,

37:00.871 --> 37:03.104
but I think I'm more mature my age.

37:05.937 --> 37:09.003
I ride a motorcycle.

37:10.303 --> 37:11.436
So, are you going to come over here

37:11.436 --> 37:12.802
and dance with me

37:12.802 --> 37:14.702
or you just going to leave

37:14.702 --> 37:17.402
this girl dancing all by herself.

37:21.735 --> 37:23.801
I love to dance.

37:24.168 --> 37:25.134
I love to dance with a man

37:25.134 --> 37:26.934
who loves to dance.

37:28.334 --> 37:30.000
It's been a long time.

37:30.367 --> 37:31.700
Forgive me for saying

37:31.700 --> 37:34.033
but why not just ditch the loser

37:34.033 --> 37:35.399
if he ain't keeping your engine running?

37:35.899 --> 37:38.166
Oh, Jimmy, it's not as simple as that.

37:39.032 --> 37:40.465
Let's just forget about him.

37:41.532 --> 37:42.565
Let's just pretend that

37:43.298 --> 37:46.265
nobody in the whole world is around.

37:47.598 --> 37:48.898
We just keep on dancing.

37:50.198 --> 37:51.164
Your smell it's.

37:51.164 --> 37:51.497
It's

37:53.997 --> 37:55.164
quite intoxicating.

37:55.630 --> 37:57.430
You smell of cigarette

37:57.430 --> 37:59.096
smoke, liquor and

38:00.563 --> 38:01.329
engine fumes.

38:01.329 --> 38:02.229
I'm sorry.

38:02.663 --> 38:07.429
Don't be, I love that smell.

38:08.295 --> 38:10.495
Jimmy, when you go out on your bike

38:10.495 --> 38:12.261
where is it you go to?

38:13.728 --> 38:14.628
I know a spot

38:15.661 --> 38:17.494
out by the woods near the cemetery.

38:17.527 --> 38:18.494
It's quiet.

38:19.827 --> 38:20.760
Gives me time to think

38:21.893 --> 38:24.460
Maybe I need a spot like that.

38:24.460 --> 38:25.326
I can take you to mine.

38:26.026 --> 38:27.793
On your bike?

38:27.793 --> 38:28.292
Sure.

38:29.326 --> 38:31.425
You could hop on and hold on.

38:31.425 --> 38:33.758
We could go now.

38:34.525 --> 38:35.791
Oh, Jimmy I'd love to.

38:36.025 --> 38:37.091
We could come with you.

38:37.291 --> 38:39.491
I have my car, I could drive us over.

38:39.724 --> 38:41.224
Well, sure. I mean, why not?

38:41.257 --> 38:42.257
The more the merrier.

38:43.990 --> 38:44.857
Looks like tonight's

38:44.857 --> 38:46.290
going to be quite an adventure.

38:46.323 --> 38:47.057
Jimmy Flynn.

38:51.556 --> 38:52.523
After a night of fun

38:52.523 --> 38:54.622
with her new friends, the next day,

38:55.122 --> 38:56.689
a Saturday, Veronica

38:56.689 --> 38:58.022
travelled into the city to pay

38:58.022 --> 38:58.855
a visit to Cliff

38:59.722 --> 39:01.088
with a surprise for her sweetheart.

39:01.521 --> 39:03.321
She had the perfect guise to see

39:03.321 --> 39:04.721
if Cliff was a man of his word.

39:05.687 --> 39:06.754
Good morning Mrs Smart.

39:06.754 --> 39:08.420
Good to see you Mrs Smart.

39:08.420 --> 39:10.054
He's in his office Mrs Smart.

39:12.020 --> 39:15.253
Maybe I didn't make myself clear Cliff.

39:15.253 --> 39:15.786
Sweetheart.

39:15.819 --> 39:17.119
Baby, what are you doing here?

39:17.186 --> 39:18.319
Oh, I had something to

39:18.319 --> 39:19.519
attend to in the city,

39:20.086 --> 39:21.585
so I thought I'd bring you a gift.

39:22.519 --> 39:23.818
This is just work Veronica,

39:23.818 --> 39:25.485
you think I'd fool around in my office?

39:25.785 --> 39:26.618
I don't know, Cliff.

39:27.251 --> 39:28.384
I didn't expect you

39:28.384 --> 39:29.884
to fool around in our bedroom,

39:30.351 --> 39:32.417
but you proved me wrong on that one.

39:32.751 --> 39:33.217
Mrs Smart.

39:33.684 --> 39:35.484
I understand what I did was wrong,

39:35.484 --> 39:37.317
but I assure you

39:37.550 --> 39:38.950
I don't want your husband.

39:39.150 --> 39:40.416
You are acting crazy.

39:40.450 --> 39:41.483
Oh, is that so?

39:41.483 --> 39:44.682
And you are acting like a desperate fool.

39:44.849 --> 39:47.182
Did I not tell you to get rid of her?

39:47.415 --> 39:48.515
Excuse me.

39:49.482 --> 39:50.848
She's leaving at the end of the week.

39:50.915 --> 39:52.448
This is just work, Veronica.

39:52.848 --> 39:54.114
You really expect me

39:54.114 --> 39:56.014
to believe that this thing

39:56.647 --> 39:58.180
will be gone by the end of the week?

39:58.647 --> 39:59.414
That's right, Mrs.

39:59.414 --> 40:00.014
Smart.

40:00.614 --> 40:02.880
This "thing" handed in her notice today.

40:03.613 --> 40:03.880
It's

40:05.346 --> 40:06.413
true baby, Lana's an actress.

40:07.079 --> 40:07.846
She's been auditioning

40:07.846 --> 40:09.179
for new plays on Broadway.

40:09.179 --> 40:10.379
And I found out today

40:10.379 --> 40:11.645
that I got a part in the new

40:11.645 --> 40:12.812
Eugene O'Neill play.

40:12.845 --> 40:15.512
I leave in a week for two out of town

40:15.512 --> 40:17.511
tryouts, then Broadway.

40:18.611 --> 40:19.044
Baby.

40:19.678 --> 40:20.744
Isn't that exciting?

40:21.011 --> 40:21.477
Lana,

40:22.744 --> 40:24.910
I need to have a talk with my husband.

40:26.143 --> 40:27.943
Of course, Mrs Smart.

40:28.210 --> 40:29.076
Honestly, I...

40:29.076 --> 40:29.810
Out!

40:34.442 --> 40:35.642
She's, she's leaving

40:35.642 --> 40:36.709
at the end of the week,

40:36.709 --> 40:37.709
why fire the girl

40:37.709 --> 40:39.075
if she is going anyway.

40:39.775 --> 40:40.775
She's an actress?

40:42.141 --> 40:42.841
Yeah, baby.

40:43.874 --> 40:44.974
Oh, like you.

40:46.141 --> 40:47.707
Maybe she could put a word in for you.

40:48.507 --> 40:49.707
You want your mistress

40:49.707 --> 40:51.507
to put a good word in for your wife.

40:52.140 --> 40:53.906
Are you hearing yourself, Cliff?

40:53.940 --> 40:55.406
I'm just thinking of you, baby.

40:56.506 --> 40:57.673
You know, Cliff,

40:58.073 --> 40:59.139
for such a big shot,

40:59.139 --> 41:01.705
you really are stupid.

41:05.105 --> 41:06.771
You're attracted to her because.

41:07.938 --> 41:11.004
She's me 16 years ago.

41:11.037 --> 41:12.271
Baby that ain't true,

41:12.271 --> 41:13.637
she can't hold a candle to you.

41:13.637 --> 41:16.670
It is Cliff, she's living my life.

41:17.403 --> 41:19.803
She gets to be the big star

41:19.803 --> 41:22.369
while I'm stuck here teaching

41:22.369 --> 41:24.269
kids to do what I should be doing.

41:25.602 --> 41:27.069
God damn you Cliff,

41:27.469 --> 41:29.402
you really know how to hurt a lady.

41:30.735 --> 41:32.168
Well, I ain't trying to...

41:32.168 --> 41:32.801
Don't.

41:34.034 --> 41:34.801
Just don't Cliff.

41:36.334 --> 41:37.301
I hurt too much.

41:38.934 --> 41:39.200
Well,

41:40.434 --> 41:42.800
what can I do, you want me to tell her

41:42.800 --> 41:43.800
to leave right this moment

41:43.800 --> 41:44.433
because I'll do it?

41:45.233 --> 41:46.766
No, no Cliff.

41:47.866 --> 41:50.099
Let your floozy stick around,

41:50.899 --> 41:52.499
because the only thing I want.

41:53.865 --> 41:57.731
Is the last 16 years of my life back.

42:07.530 --> 42:08.297
Don't talk that way.

42:09.596 --> 42:10.963
When I was a little girl,

42:12.463 --> 42:13.662
I used to dream about what

42:13.662 --> 42:14.929
my life would be like.

42:16.495 --> 42:17.895
One thing I knew for certain.

42:19.528 --> 42:22.428
Was that I wanted to be somebody?

42:25.261 --> 42:26.494
I wanted more than

42:27.527 --> 42:30.294
those four dark, damp walls that trapped

42:30.360 --> 42:32.360
me as a child and I wanted more than

42:33.826 --> 42:35.060
my mother's loneliness

42:35.826 --> 42:36.893
and disappointment.

42:39.326 --> 42:40.626
I just knew I needed more.

42:43.492 --> 42:45.325
I would dance around in my room.

42:46.258 --> 42:48.225
Arms extended, imagining I was

42:49.158 --> 42:50.258
I was up on a stage,

42:50.258 --> 42:52.691
a vaudeville show or movie

42:52.691 --> 42:54.057
picture, I didn't care.

42:56.557 --> 42:57.890
I just knew I needed more.

42:59.923 --> 43:00.790
And then I met you.

43:03.123 --> 43:05.056
Happiest day in my whole entire life.

43:05.956 --> 43:07.189
And I thought to myself.

43:08.589 --> 43:10.088
Could this be my more

43:11.122 --> 43:13.954
to be this handsome man's wife

43:15.021 --> 43:17.321
and I thought and thought.

43:18.787 --> 43:20.087
And as much as I loved you,

43:20.087 --> 43:22.387
I knew I just couldn't

43:22.387 --> 43:23.886
give up on that part of my dream

43:25.286 --> 43:25.920
with you.

43:27.153 --> 43:28.719
You said all the right things

43:28.719 --> 43:29.752
to ease my mind.

43:32.085 --> 43:32.852
Do you remember,

43:33.818 --> 43:35.152
do you remember what you said to me

43:35.152 --> 43:36.351
when we first got together Cliff?

43:38.385 --> 43:39.584
I said I could make you happy.

43:41.584 --> 43:42.351
You said that

43:43.784 --> 43:46.517
my dreams, my ambitions

43:46.517 --> 43:48.883
would always be as important as yours,

43:49.583 --> 43:50.816
that we would help each other

43:51.349 --> 43:53.116
and support each other in it.

43:53.116 --> 43:56.116
I remember thinking perfect.

43:57.349 --> 43:58.415
Now I can be whole.

44:00.682 --> 44:03.081
But you never, never

44:03.281 --> 44:04.648
helped me or supported me,

44:04.648 --> 44:06.381
not in any way that matters,

44:07.614 --> 44:09.614
because you thought that eventually

44:10.514 --> 44:12.213
I'd give up on that part of my life.

44:13.180 --> 44:15.846
And I would just learn to be silent

44:17.413 --> 44:19.879
and just become your wife.

44:21.312 --> 44:23.512
Baby that ain't true.

44:26.345 --> 44:27.045
It is Cliff.

44:28.645 --> 44:30.178
When have you ever taken me Hollywood?

44:31.644 --> 44:32.911
I have been asking you

44:32.911 --> 44:35.610
for 16 years, but still

44:36.777 --> 44:37.843
you've never taken me.

44:38.876 --> 44:39.743
Baby, you don't need

44:39.743 --> 44:40.943
Hollywood to be a star.

44:40.976 --> 44:41.909
I know that.

44:43.009 --> 44:44.709
But I need it to make me one.

44:46.509 --> 44:48.942
Jesus, how the hell did I end up here?

44:49.942 --> 44:50.308
Now.

44:51.342 --> 44:52.475
Just stop that.

44:52.475 --> 44:54.174
This ain't a bad life

44:54.174 --> 44:55.441
you got for yourself here, Veronica.

44:55.508 --> 44:56.208
Oh, Cliff.

44:57.774 --> 44:59.807
These past few days have just confirmed

44:59.807 --> 45:01.807
everything that I already knew.

45:04.306 --> 45:06.106
You don't want me to have my more.

45:08.106 --> 45:10.639
But you sure as hell want to have yours.

45:14.738 --> 45:15.438
So that's it.

45:15.805 --> 45:17.138
We even gonna talk?

45:17.138 --> 45:17.971
Not now, Cliff.

45:18.871 --> 45:21.271
I may say something that I truly regret.

45:23.737 --> 45:24.104
Well.

45:25.704 --> 45:26.637
Will, I see you at home later?

45:28.503 --> 45:31.003
Go for a long walk after work tonight.

45:31.769 --> 45:32.936
Maybe a couple of drinks,

45:33.803 --> 45:35.536
because I really need some time

45:35.536 --> 45:38.135
to figure out what it is that I want.

45:54.966 --> 45:55.900
It ain't no mystery

45:55.900 --> 45:57.399
that the youths who live in the slum

45:57.399 --> 45:58.899
side of town lived a life of risk.

45:59.666 --> 46:00.799
Some of the kids like Riff

46:00.799 --> 46:01.999
didn't live with their parents.

46:02.232 --> 46:03.165
For them it is the street.

46:03.832 --> 46:04.532
Some have to work

46:04.532 --> 46:05.532
their fingers to the bone,

46:05.765 --> 46:07.731
sacrificing an education to pitch in.

46:08.365 --> 46:09.798
Sure, the boys had a few run

46:09.798 --> 46:11.031
ins with the law, but

46:11.031 --> 46:12.264
it was petty stuff, mainly

46:12.464 --> 46:14.197
just to put a hot meal inside them.

46:14.630 --> 46:15.730
But these were good kids,

46:16.230 --> 46:17.997
living in surroundings that could easily

46:17.997 --> 46:19.196
take them down the wrong path.

46:20.196 --> 46:21.729
That night, Jimmy

46:21.729 --> 46:22.996
joined Riff by the Docks,

46:23.696 --> 46:24.696
a regular hangout

46:25.262 --> 46:27.095
for the undesirables of the city.

46:36.328 --> 46:37.261
So what you get?

46:37.961 --> 46:39.160
Two bucks and a coupon

46:39.327 --> 46:40.927
for canned meat.

46:40.927 --> 46:42.793
Damn it Jimmy, I can't keep doing this.

46:42.793 --> 46:43.360
Doing what?

46:43.360 --> 46:44.426
Pickpocketing, breaking

46:44.426 --> 46:45.393
into people's houses.

46:45.493 --> 46:46.759
Well you know what to do Riff.

46:46.759 --> 46:48.626
I can't stay with you.

46:49.059 --> 46:50.492
I ain't going to be a burden to nobody.

46:50.759 --> 46:51.792
Riff you ain't no burden,

46:52.659 --> 46:53.559
your my best friend.

46:53.592 --> 46:54.892
I want to help.

46:54.892 --> 46:55.625
Jimmy, your old man can

46:55.625 --> 46:56.725
barely afford to keep you,

46:56.725 --> 46:57.391
he ain't looking for

46:57.391 --> 46:58.658
no new kid in the house.

47:01.957 --> 47:03.891
I gotta have a future Jimmy, I just gotta.

47:03.891 --> 47:05.457
This can't be it.

47:05.457 --> 47:07.123
I know just how you feel Riff, but.

47:08.590 --> 47:10.456
Well, that's a problem for another day.

47:10.723 --> 47:13.489
No, it ain't, we're sixteen now Jimmy

47:13.489 --> 47:14.889
there's a whole world

47:14.889 --> 47:16.389
out there, opportunities you know.

47:16.389 --> 47:18.155
Sure thing Riff, but that's a whole world

47:18.155 --> 47:19.588
you and I ain't ever going to see.

47:19.588 --> 47:20.922
Don't say that.

47:28.954 --> 47:29.787
It's been one year

47:29.954 --> 47:31.287
since my parents die.

47:34.320 --> 47:35.053
Jeez.

47:38.386 --> 47:39.452
I didn't even realise.

47:42.685 --> 47:43.352
I'm sorry.

47:45.252 --> 47:46.518
One year since the fire.

47:49.418 --> 47:51.251
God, that one moment in my life

47:51.251 --> 47:53.051
and I lost everything.

47:56.417 --> 47:56.917
You know.

47:59.416 --> 48:00.483
You are my family.

48:01.050 --> 48:01.683
I know.

48:01.949 --> 48:03.149
I mean, it is great.

48:03.149 --> 48:05.882
But I mean, it's not the same.

48:05.882 --> 48:10.682
After seeing Veronicas house

48:10.682 --> 48:12.048
I got this aching feeling all over me.

48:13.215 --> 48:14.215
What do you mean?

48:14.514 --> 48:15.114
I got jealous?

48:16.081 --> 48:17.881
All that money, the house,

48:17.881 --> 48:19.447
all those rooms.

48:19.447 --> 48:22.380
My house burns to the ground,

48:22.380 --> 48:24.413
taking my parents with it and here I am.

48:26.513 --> 48:27.846
When did we get chosen

48:27.846 --> 48:28.946
to be the failures?

48:29.946 --> 48:31.246
We ain't living in a world

48:31.246 --> 48:32.612
that wants to hear what we got to say.

48:32.612 --> 48:34.845
You know, people would rather

48:34.845 --> 48:37.045
just walk past us, pretend we don't exist.

48:37.045 --> 48:38.811
Why does it have to be final?

48:39.211 --> 48:41.144
People must find a way out of this.

48:41.311 --> 48:42.444
I mean, Jesus Jimmy,

48:42.544 --> 48:44.144
my shoes are falling apart,

48:44.144 --> 48:45.110
I haven't slept well

48:45.110 --> 48:46.110
in a year, and I'm hungry.

48:46.710 --> 48:48.543
I'm hungry all the time.

48:48.543 --> 48:50.210
The only time I get to eat is at school.

48:51.510 --> 48:52.976
Whatever happened to the American dream?

48:54.076 --> 48:55.942
The thing with the American dream is

48:56.509 --> 48:58.275
most of us wake up.

48:59.475 --> 49:00.408
We move on.

49:00.442 --> 49:01.975
Not everyone can be a success.

49:01.975 --> 49:02.641
No.

49:03.008 --> 49:04.208
Riff the streets are paved

49:04.208 --> 49:05.074
with shit and poverty.

49:06.208 --> 49:09.007
The gold, It's rare.

49:10.007 --> 49:11.674
Now, we may never get the gold,

49:11.674 --> 49:12.473
but we just got to avoid

49:12.473 --> 49:13.307
the shit, you know.

49:13.607 --> 49:15.506
So what, I just sit here

49:15.506 --> 49:16.206
and hope some shlep

49:16.206 --> 49:18.506
gives me a dime or two?

49:18.506 --> 49:19.639
God bless America.

49:19.639 --> 49:21.639
I can grab you something from my house.

49:23.172 --> 49:23.705
Or I could.

49:25.772 --> 49:26.205
Help.

49:27.805 --> 49:28.471
You know.

49:28.738 --> 49:29.838
If I gotta take something

49:29.838 --> 49:31.371
heavy on, I'm doing it alone.

49:32.104 --> 49:33.437
I'm fine, really Jimmy.

49:33.971 --> 49:37.470
You just go home, I'll see you tomorrow.

49:37.470 --> 49:38.337
I promise.

49:43.436 --> 49:43.936
Alright.

49:48.802 --> 49:49.435
You be careful out here,

49:49.569 --> 49:50.335
you hear me.

49:53.268 --> 49:55.534
Jimmy leaves Riff on the docks,

49:55.534 --> 49:57.901
but as Riff follows him away

49:57.901 --> 49:59.967
See you tomorrow Riff.

50:01.167 --> 50:03.333
He sees a man walking down the docks.

50:03.333 --> 50:05.100
Alone.

50:06.066 --> 50:08.199
You need to eat Riff.

50:08.199 --> 50:09.566
But as the figure gets closer.

50:10.366 --> 50:11.266
Well, how could he know?

50:12.199 --> 50:13.699
How could he have known the man

50:13.699 --> 50:15.265
approaching was Cliff Smart,

50:16.265 --> 50:17.498
wandering the streets,

50:17.998 --> 50:20.264
thinking about his failures as a husband?

50:24.864 --> 50:25.997
Hey, step aside.

50:26.430 --> 50:27.430
Not so fast, mister.

50:27.463 --> 50:28.663
I'm going to need ten,

50:28.730 --> 50:30.996
I mean five bucks for you to pass.

50:30.996 --> 50:32.696
A tax, if you will.

50:32.963 --> 50:34.163
I said, get out of my way.

50:34.163 --> 50:35.129
I ain't in the mood.

50:35.129 --> 50:36.662
I ain't gonna ask you again.

50:37.629 --> 50:38.195
Look at

50:38.795 --> 50:40.295
you ain't getting anything from me.

50:41.062 --> 50:41.862
So why don't you run

50:41.862 --> 50:43.095
on home to mommy and daddy

50:43.095 --> 50:44.761
so they can teach you some respect?

50:44.794 --> 50:45.461
What did you say?

50:46.728 --> 50:47.727
I said move.

50:49.127 --> 50:51.260
I just need some money for some food...

50:51.260 --> 50:52.927
Ain't interested in your sob story, kid.

50:54.127 --> 50:54.760
Jesus.

50:55.693 --> 50:57.493
Your parents sure as hell failed you.

51:00.759 --> 51:02.425
Oh, you are dead!

51:09.125 --> 51:11.124
I just wanted to eat,

51:11.124 --> 51:12.024
why couldn't you see,

51:12.024 --> 51:13.224
I just wanted to eat,

51:14.324 --> 51:15.924
I ain't a bad kid, I swear.

51:17.690 --> 51:18.557
I'm sorry, Mr.

51:19.423 --> 51:20.123
I'm sorry.

51:28.622 --> 51:30.122
Cliff.

51:30.122 --> 51:31.588
What happened to you, are you ok?

51:31.855 --> 51:34.621
Sure, act like you care, Veronica.

51:34.954 --> 51:36.221
What a cold thing to say.

51:36.521 --> 51:37.887
I ain't in the mood to argue.

51:37.921 --> 51:38.387
Come here.

51:38.621 --> 51:39.321
Let me see it.

51:47.153 --> 51:48.553
Oh, that looks like a nasty gash,

51:48.553 --> 51:50.052
I think we're going to have to call

51:50.052 --> 51:52.219
Dr. Morgan out just to be safe.

51:52.885 --> 51:54.085
I don't need that quack.

51:55.085 --> 51:56.085
I'll be fine as soon

51:56.085 --> 51:58.151
as my head stops spinning.

51:58.151 --> 51:58.551
Well,

51:59.585 --> 52:00.451
what happened to you?

52:00.618 --> 52:02.118
It looks as though you were attacked.

52:03.584 --> 52:05.084
I took a walk after work

52:05.084 --> 52:06.817
down by the waterfront.

52:07.683 --> 52:08.717
I went down through the tunnel

52:08.717 --> 52:10.450
where the street kids live.

52:11.450 --> 52:12.583
One of them hit me with a bat

52:12.583 --> 52:13.483
and took my money,

52:14.283 --> 52:15.282
son of a bitch.

52:16.082 --> 52:17.915
If I ever lay my eyes on him again, then.

52:18.982 --> 52:20.582
He ain't going to see his next birthday.

52:20.882 --> 52:22.115
Why would you go down there?

52:22.748 --> 52:24.248
I was trying to clear my mind.

52:24.815 --> 52:26.148
You told me to take a walk.

52:26.448 --> 52:27.281
You needed time.

52:27.514 --> 52:28.414
But down there.

52:30.314 --> 52:31.380
The police should take out

52:31.380 --> 52:33.680
a gun and get rid of the vermin

52:33.680 --> 52:35.413
who do nothing but dirty up the city.

52:36.213 --> 52:37.679
Cliff, most of them are children

52:37.679 --> 52:39.346
who have fallen on hard times.

52:39.379 --> 52:40.612
Not everybody was

52:40.612 --> 52:42.079
as privileged as you were.

52:42.712 --> 52:44.879
Wait, your defending them?

52:45.545 --> 52:46.945
No, no.

52:46.945 --> 52:47.611
It's just.

52:48.545 --> 52:50.744
Some of the kids I teach live down there,

52:51.311 --> 52:53.344
you know, school is all they have

52:53.344 --> 52:55.144
at given them any kind of a shot.

52:56.477 --> 52:57.710
I just feel sorry for them.

52:58.877 --> 53:00.076
Well they ain't getting a shot.

53:00.943 --> 53:01.743
God don't pay no

53:01.743 --> 53:02.876
attention to those kinds.

53:03.676 --> 53:05.509
You really can be so cruel.

53:06.009 --> 53:07.842
Hey, it's my head split open here.

53:09.709 --> 53:13.075
So these boys, what do they look like?

53:14.108 --> 53:15.108
All these street kids

53:15.108 --> 53:15.941
look the same to me,

53:17.108 --> 53:19.374
although I do know

53:19.374 --> 53:20.607
that one of them was called Riff.

53:21.907 --> 53:23.640
Riff? Yeah.

53:24.807 --> 53:26.306
One of his friends shouted at him,

53:27.073 --> 53:29.539
slipped up and used his name.

53:29.539 --> 53:30.906
Degenerates.

53:30.906 --> 53:31.839
He could have killed you.

53:44.171 --> 53:45.170
Some say that the kids

53:45.170 --> 53:46.237
never stood a chance.

53:46.837 --> 53:47.837
They were broken,

53:48.303 --> 53:50.503
searching for something more and easily

53:50.503 --> 53:51.736
manipulated by a woman

53:51.736 --> 53:52.936
who took advantage of it all.

53:53.869 --> 53:55.869
I say, I guess that's for you to decide.

53:55.869 --> 53:57.369
But one thing is undeniable.

53:57.902 --> 54:00.202
She certainly shook things up all right

54:00.202 --> 54:01.602
and she spun a web

54:01.602 --> 54:02.968
that a vulnerable person could

54:02.968 --> 54:04.035
easily fall into.

54:04.701 --> 54:05.801
And Vivian, did.

54:06.701 --> 54:08.201
You have been out after school

54:08.201 --> 54:09.234
every evening this week,

54:09.234 --> 54:10.367
where are you going?

54:10.500 --> 54:11.534
I am not telling you mother,

54:11.534 --> 54:12.933
because you'll only judge.

54:13.200 --> 54:13.600
Fine.

54:13.967 --> 54:14.667
Then you won't be leaving

54:14.800 --> 54:15.566
this house tonight.

54:15.566 --> 54:16.300
Vivian Pierce.

54:16.833 --> 54:18.133
I am not a child anymore.

54:18.166 --> 54:19.166
I'm fifteen.

54:19.199 --> 54:20.966
A child is exactly what you are.

54:22.965 --> 54:24.499
You're out with those boys again.

54:24.532 --> 54:25.898
Do you think I don't know that

54:26.365 --> 54:28.198
you can't outsmart your mother.

54:28.331 --> 54:28.765
Ha!

54:29.398 --> 54:30.031
Then you're wrong.

54:30.031 --> 54:30.698
Vivian!

54:30.864 --> 54:31.698
I've been going to see

54:31.698 --> 54:33.197
my new teacher, actually.

54:33.731 --> 54:34.797
Mrs Smart?

54:34.931 --> 54:35.764
The lady I met?

54:35.830 --> 54:36.330
Yes.

54:36.597 --> 54:37.897
She's been teaching me all about

54:37.897 --> 54:38.997
how to make it in Hollywood.

54:39.163 --> 54:41.030
Private lessons for free.

54:41.363 --> 54:41.963
Oh, mother.

54:41.963 --> 54:43.296
She's one of the most fascinating

54:43.296 --> 54:44.429
people I've ever met.

54:44.929 --> 54:46.429
Acting, no.

54:47.362 --> 54:47.995
But mother, it's

54:47.995 --> 54:50.062
something I want so bad that it hurts.

54:50.728 --> 54:51.828
Oh, Vivian,

54:52.128 --> 54:54.061
you are not going to be a movie star.

54:54.295 --> 54:55.961
You are far too plain looking.

54:56.061 --> 54:57.661
No, no, I'm not,

54:57.661 --> 54:58.861
I've got great bone structure.

54:59.061 --> 55:00.227
Veronica told me.

55:00.927 --> 55:01.894
I don't know what's going on

55:01.894 --> 55:03.527
with you, Vivian, but I don't like it.

55:03.527 --> 55:05.027
Why can't you just be happy?

55:05.127 --> 55:06.593
Because I've lived Vivian.

55:06.593 --> 55:07.826
I know the dangers

55:07.826 --> 55:09.459
and I want to protect you.

55:09.493 --> 55:10.692
I am going, mother.

55:11.892 --> 55:13.425
It's a scary world out there.

55:14.392 --> 55:15.625
And people's motives aren't always

55:15.625 --> 55:16.658
what they appear to be.

55:19.658 --> 55:21.158
Living with that fear

55:21.791 --> 55:23.391
is not living, mother.

55:25.024 --> 55:25.291
Now.

55:26.824 --> 55:27.824
I'll be home by ten.

55:29.323 --> 55:29.990
Don't wait up.

55:46.254 --> 55:48.587
My dad doesn't show love.

55:50.121 --> 55:50.854
He hates me.

55:51.020 --> 55:51.454
No.

55:51.454 --> 55:52.087
It's cool.

55:53.253 --> 55:54.353
Sometimes you're not supposed

55:54.353 --> 55:55.287
to like your parents

55:56.053 --> 55:58.419
or they're not supposed to like you,

55:58.419 --> 55:59.119
I guess.

55:59.986 --> 56:00.786
That's tough.

56:02.786 --> 56:04.152
Jimmy, what scares you?

56:06.018 --> 56:09.051
I guess, turning out like him.

56:10.418 --> 56:11.484
Staying in this town

56:11.484 --> 56:12.518
my soul rotting away

56:12.518 --> 56:13.451
until there's nothing left.

56:14.784 --> 56:15.517
Just a black hole.

56:17.217 --> 56:18.217
You can always leave.

56:18.583 --> 56:19.483
And go where?

56:20.083 --> 56:21.016
It's a pipe dream,

56:21.050 --> 56:21.683
I'm never going to have

56:21.683 --> 56:22.383
that kind of money.

56:24.083 --> 56:26.182
Well, all I can do is

56:26.182 --> 56:27.816
wait for the old man to meet his maker.

56:28.615 --> 56:29.949
Maybe I'll get the house, you know,

56:30.815 --> 56:32.182
sell it and leave, but.

56:33.448 --> 56:34.581
Until then I guess I just.

56:36.048 --> 56:36.781
stay still.

56:38.347 --> 56:38.981
Motionless.

56:40.481 --> 56:41.880
Like a car without an engine.

56:43.313 --> 56:44.680
I guess we all get stuck

56:44.680 --> 56:46.380
from time to time in a position

56:46.380 --> 56:48.579
that we just can't get out of.

56:49.946 --> 56:50.579
Your husband?

56:52.779 --> 56:54.045
I feel like I'm drowning

56:54.045 --> 56:56.145
in my own personal hell.

56:56.545 --> 56:57.945
Then why don't you just leave him?

56:59.011 --> 57:00.844
It's not as simple as that,

57:00.844 --> 57:03.244
he owns everything, the house,

57:03.244 --> 57:04.611
the cars, the money.

57:05.644 --> 57:06.510
I have nothing.

57:06.510 --> 57:08.044
Material stuff isn't everything.

57:08.077 --> 57:08.910
It is Jimmy.

57:10.077 --> 57:11.243
You can't live without money.

57:13.776 --> 57:15.876
I should have been somebody by now,

57:16.642 --> 57:18.042
but he's always held me back,

57:18.042 --> 57:19.875
he's never let me be who I should be.

57:22.508 --> 57:23.841
You know what, if this is it for me

57:23.841 --> 57:25.141
now, what if my....

57:25.575 --> 57:26.774
what if my time is done?

57:26.974 --> 57:28.374
It doesn't have to be.

57:29.207 --> 57:30.641
Oh would you listen to me?

57:31.474 --> 57:32.907
I'm so sorry, I shouldn't

57:32.907 --> 57:34.340
be putting my problems onto you.

57:35.573 --> 57:37.306
Can you forgive me.

57:37.606 --> 57:40.839
You have done nothing to be forgiven for.

57:43.772 --> 57:44.705
Jimmy?

57:45.505 --> 57:46.905
Would you excuse me for a moment?

57:48.871 --> 57:49.638
I'll be right back.

57:55.737 --> 57:57.804
Veronica gets up and leaves the room,

57:57.804 --> 57:58.970
leaving Jimmy alone.

57:59.803 --> 58:00.770
What is she doing?

58:01.603 --> 58:02.636
What is she up to?

58:03.736 --> 58:05.436
Everything about it was calculated,

58:05.436 --> 58:07.236
you see, every word,

58:07.769 --> 58:10.002
every gesture, every move.

58:10.968 --> 58:13.002
When she walked back into the room,

58:13.901 --> 58:15.301
her motives were clear.

59:08.194 --> 59:09.561
But as Veronica seduced

59:09.561 --> 59:10.994
Jimmy in her marital bed,

59:11.794 --> 59:13.027
both had failed to notice

59:13.027 --> 59:16.093
that Vivian had arrived and she saw all

59:16.093 --> 59:17.293
she needed to see.

59:34.091 --> 59:34.557
Honey,

59:35.591 --> 59:36.357
I'm home.

59:36.490 --> 59:38.923
Cliff, another night with Lana?

59:39.423 --> 59:41.956
No, I was with a friend,

59:42.790 --> 59:44.289
a man can have friends, you know,

59:44.456 --> 59:47.156
And what a good friend she is.

59:47.756 --> 59:50.422
And, uh, what about you, my dear wife?

59:51.122 --> 59:52.788
How did you spend your evening?

59:52.888 --> 59:54.721
Well, I thought I'd invite

59:54.721 --> 59:56.521
some men over and start

59:56.588 --> 59:58.521
a torrid affair behind your back.

59:58.554 --> 1:00:00.154
That's funny.

1:00:00.154 --> 1:00:01.587
Oh, I'm drunk.

1:00:01.887 --> 1:00:02.720
So I see.

1:00:03.887 --> 1:00:05.053
What the hell is this?

1:00:06.720 --> 1:00:07.186
What?

1:00:09.153 --> 1:00:10.053
Don't tell me

1:00:11.219 --> 1:00:12.319
the several guys

1:00:12.319 --> 1:00:13.719
who came to visit with you, right?

1:00:14.052 --> 1:00:14.752
Yes Cliff.

1:00:15.219 --> 1:00:16.752
That's exactly right.

1:00:17.452 --> 1:00:19.318
Have you got some guy Veronica?

1:00:19.985 --> 1:00:21.484
Yes, actually,

1:00:22.584 --> 1:00:23.951
his names Jimmy.

1:00:24.317 --> 1:00:25.017
Oh,

1:00:25.451 --> 1:00:26.317
and Riff,

1:00:26.550 --> 1:00:27.517
and Vivian.

1:00:28.050 --> 1:00:28.983
Two guys

1:00:30.350 --> 1:00:32.216
in my house with my wife.

1:00:32.250 --> 1:00:33.849
Are you completely insane?

1:00:34.149 --> 1:00:35.283
Oh, relax, Cliff.

1:00:35.916 --> 1:00:37.082
It's just three students

1:00:37.082 --> 1:00:38.715
that I teach over at the school.

1:00:39.182 --> 1:00:40.882
I'm giving them private acting lessons.

1:00:41.582 --> 1:00:42.848
Why didn't you tell me?

1:00:43.715 --> 1:00:44.515
Would you care?

1:00:45.448 --> 1:00:46.548
I care,

1:00:47.181 --> 1:00:48.614
I always care.

1:00:49.781 --> 1:00:51.514
God we used to laugh.

1:00:52.114 --> 1:00:54.280
We used to make love all night.

1:00:54.280 --> 1:00:56.446
We used to talk until the early hours

1:00:56.446 --> 1:00:57.280
of the morning, but

1:00:58.613 --> 1:00:59.546
now I.

1:01:00.446 --> 1:01:01.712
I barely get a hello.

1:01:03.079 --> 1:01:04.845
Godammit Veronica,

1:01:04.845 --> 1:01:07.512
I'm hurting, I'm hurting real bad

1:01:07.512 --> 1:01:09.211
and if your not ready

1:01:09.211 --> 1:01:10.345
to forgive me then...

1:01:10.611 --> 1:01:11.344
What?

1:01:12.044 --> 1:01:13.478
What Cliff?

1:01:13.777 --> 1:01:15.411
Oh, God damn it Veronica,

1:01:15.544 --> 1:01:17.610
you are milking this for all you can.

1:01:20.010 --> 1:01:21.243
How do I know that

1:01:21.243 --> 1:01:23.110
you ain't cheating, huh?

1:01:24.243 --> 1:01:25.443
I mean, you said you've

1:01:25.443 --> 1:01:26.876
had these kids over, but

1:01:27.309 --> 1:01:28.909
how do I know that ain't a cover

1:01:29.875 --> 1:01:31.542
and you've been stepping out on me?

1:01:33.408 --> 1:01:36.441
Veronica, steady as a rock rises

1:01:36.441 --> 1:01:38.074
slowly out of her chair.

1:01:39.407 --> 1:01:42.940
Has the cat got your tongue Veronica.

1:01:42.940 --> 1:01:45.507
Hahaha.

1:01:48.473 --> 1:01:51.472
Where the hell are you going Veronica?

1:01:52.239 --> 1:01:52.906
Veronica!

1:01:56.572 --> 1:01:58.238
God damn,

1:01:59.871 --> 1:02:02.471
what the hell are you doing Cliff.

1:02:03.904 --> 1:02:06.904
(Motorcycle Sound)

1:02:11.403 --> 1:02:12.403
(Thunder)

1:02:14.336 --> 1:02:15.903
Jimmy, thank God you came,

1:02:15.903 --> 1:02:16.902
I didn't know who else to call.

1:02:17.269 --> 1:02:18.336
Of course I came.

1:02:18.336 --> 1:02:19.435
You sounded scared.

1:02:19.502 --> 1:02:20.835
I knew something was wrong.

1:02:20.935 --> 1:02:21.735
Of course you did,

1:02:22.135 --> 1:02:23.735
because you get me, Jimmy.

1:02:23.735 --> 1:02:25.701
I knew it from the first day we met.

1:02:26.168 --> 1:02:26.601
Oh, God.

1:02:26.634 --> 1:02:27.801
Jimmy, what am I doing?

1:02:27.834 --> 1:02:28.601
Talk to me.

1:02:29.267 --> 1:02:31.367
Wipe your tears and talk to me.

1:02:31.367 --> 1:02:32.034
What happened?

1:02:32.400 --> 1:02:33.700
Jimmy, he was so angry

1:02:33.700 --> 1:02:34.800
when he came home tonight.

1:02:34.900 --> 1:02:36.833
It was like his face changed

1:02:36.833 --> 1:02:38.666
into something I'd never seen before.

1:02:38.866 --> 1:02:39.599
What did he do?

1:02:39.699 --> 1:02:41.899
Jimmy, the violence in his eyes.

1:02:43.132 --> 1:02:43.866
He hit you?

1:02:44.165 --> 1:02:46.632
And then Veronica lied.

1:02:47.032 --> 1:02:49.698
Yes, I think he wanted to hurt me.

1:02:50.698 --> 1:02:52.098
After he struck my face,

1:02:52.098 --> 1:02:53.631
he just started yelling at me.

1:02:54.231 --> 1:02:55.964
He called me names that no woman

1:02:55.964 --> 1:02:57.197
should ever be called.

1:02:57.197 --> 1:02:58.197
That son of a bitch.

1:02:58.430 --> 1:03:00.097
He started ripping at my clothes

1:03:00.097 --> 1:03:02.763
like a wild beast would do his eyes,

1:03:02.763 --> 1:03:04.496
they were so black, blacker

1:03:04.496 --> 1:03:06.363
than the darkest of nights.

1:03:06.429 --> 1:03:07.929
How can a man put his hands

1:03:07.929 --> 1:03:08.896
on a woman like that?

1:03:09.529 --> 1:03:11.162
I mean, I know that I'm not perfect,

1:03:11.162 --> 1:03:12.762
but even I know that when a guy meets

1:03:12.762 --> 1:03:13.662
a girl like you,

1:03:14.995 --> 1:03:15.961
she should be treated

1:03:15.961 --> 1:03:16.794
like the queen that she is.

1:03:17.194 --> 1:03:18.394
Oh, Jimmy.

1:03:18.794 --> 1:03:21.061
Jimmy your words, I love your words.

1:03:21.061 --> 1:03:23.427
But I think Cliff thinks...

1:03:23.427 --> 1:03:25.460
What? What does he think?

1:03:26.193 --> 1:03:27.526
That maybe I talk about

1:03:27.526 --> 1:03:28.960
a certain student too much.

1:03:29.759 --> 1:03:31.826
Perhaps I'm looking at him with eyes.

1:03:31.826 --> 1:03:33.326
I used to look at my husband with.

1:03:34.192 --> 1:03:36.825
Jimmy, do you look at me that way?

1:03:37.392 --> 1:03:38.458
Veronica, I can't

1:03:38.458 --> 1:03:39.625
stop thinking about you.

1:03:39.658 --> 1:03:40.325
The other night...

1:03:40.425 --> 1:03:41.291
But this is wrong.

1:03:41.491 --> 1:03:43.058
Everything about this is wrong.

1:03:43.091 --> 1:03:44.024
I'm your teacher.

1:03:44.024 --> 1:03:45.224
You're only sixteen.

1:03:45.224 --> 1:03:46.391
Men have done great things

1:03:46.391 --> 1:03:47.924
at sixteen I told you

1:03:48.790 --> 1:03:49.723
I'm more mature.

1:03:51.590 --> 1:03:53.890
Yes, I see that, I see it all,

1:03:54.056 --> 1:03:56.423
that beauty, God such beauty.

1:03:56.856 --> 1:03:58.322
Jimmy, what are we doing?

1:03:58.422 --> 1:03:59.289
I don't know, but

1:03:59.289 --> 1:04:00.455
I don't want it to stop.

1:04:00.689 --> 1:04:02.388
I can't stop thinking about kissing you,

1:04:02.855 --> 1:04:04.755
your arms wrapped around me tight.

1:04:04.755 --> 1:04:05.521
Veronica.

1:04:05.921 --> 1:04:07.454
To look into your beautiful eyes

1:04:07.454 --> 1:04:08.688
as you make love to me

1:04:08.688 --> 1:04:10.021
all night long again.

1:04:10.854 --> 1:04:12.487
I want to kiss you so bad.

1:04:12.520 --> 1:04:14.520
But I ain't about to cause

1:04:14.520 --> 1:04:15.387
you any problems.

1:04:15.387 --> 1:04:16.053
Oh, Jimmy.

1:04:16.786 --> 1:04:19.053
You're not my problem, don't you see?

1:04:19.919 --> 1:04:22.219
You're my bright, shining light.

1:04:23.452 --> 1:04:25.019
The two kiss passionately

1:04:25.019 --> 1:04:26.285
as the rain pours down,

1:04:26.818 --> 1:04:28.552
maybe to wash their sins away.

1:04:29.285 --> 1:04:30.718
It was a point of no return.

1:04:31.218 --> 1:04:35.117
Love, lust, desperation, manipulation.

1:04:35.584 --> 1:04:36.884
Nobody knew at that point,

1:04:37.384 --> 1:04:38.817
least of all Jimmy Flynn,

1:04:39.350 --> 1:04:40.683
a sixteen year old boy

1:04:40.683 --> 1:04:42.716
whose fantasy was coming to life.

1:04:52.315 --> 1:04:54.048
So what do you think, Betty?

1:04:55.015 --> 1:04:56.381
I think your mothers going to send you to

1:04:56.381 --> 1:04:58.414
a convent in a dress like that.

1:04:58.414 --> 1:04:59.881
Where did you get it from?

1:04:59.881 --> 1:05:01.681
Oh, Veronica gave it to me.

1:05:02.014 --> 1:05:03.914
She said I should really start

1:05:03.914 --> 1:05:06.247
to dress to be the person I want to be.

1:05:06.547 --> 1:05:07.646
A bar room hooker?

1:05:07.646 --> 1:05:10.546
No Betty, a movie star.

1:05:11.346 --> 1:05:12.812
I don't even know why you think

1:05:12.812 --> 1:05:13.812
she's so special.

1:05:14.046 --> 1:05:16.079
She's hardly a young starlet.

1:05:16.112 --> 1:05:17.478
You don't understand, Betty.

1:05:18.712 --> 1:05:19.911
Her husband stopped her

1:05:19.911 --> 1:05:21.245
going into the movies anymore.

1:05:21.844 --> 1:05:23.211
She used to be somebody.

1:05:23.511 --> 1:05:24.244
Oh, really?

1:05:24.611 --> 1:05:26.011
Is that what she told you?

1:05:26.044 --> 1:05:27.544
Why aren't you happy for me?

1:05:29.510 --> 1:05:31.077
You know, Veronica said

1:05:31.077 --> 1:05:31.677
you should really

1:05:31.677 --> 1:05:33.110
surround yourself with people

1:05:33.476 --> 1:05:34.343
who believe in you.

1:05:35.276 --> 1:05:36.143
Jeez.

1:05:36.643 --> 1:05:38.242
Are you trying to say I'm not supportive.

1:05:38.509 --> 1:05:39.809
I just think you could embrace

1:05:39.809 --> 1:05:40.775
my new look more.

1:05:41.309 --> 1:05:43.842
I would if Veronica wasnt trying

1:05:43.842 --> 1:05:44.275
to turn you into

1:05:44.275 --> 1:05:45.375
something that you ain't.

1:05:45.841 --> 1:05:46.741
I would if I wasn't

1:05:46.741 --> 1:05:47.841
losing my best friend to her.

1:05:48.274 --> 1:05:50.007
Oh, that's rather dramatic, Betty.

1:05:50.441 --> 1:05:51.107
Really?

1:05:51.674 --> 1:05:53.507
You were supposed to stay at mine

1:05:53.507 --> 1:05:54.507
last night but you never showed.

1:05:54.707 --> 1:05:55.940
Oh, jeez, Betty.

1:05:56.307 --> 1:05:57.406
I'm so sorry.

1:05:57.440 --> 1:05:58.940
I completely forgot.

1:05:59.006 --> 1:05:59.973
It's like you love her.

1:05:59.973 --> 1:06:00.806
I admire her.

1:06:01.639 --> 1:06:03.406
And I just want to be like her.

1:06:03.806 --> 1:06:05.972
I mean, what kind of life do I

1:06:05.972 --> 1:06:07.605
really have after school huh?

1:06:07.872 --> 1:06:09.671
Veronica's just showing me a new way.

1:06:12.004 --> 1:06:12.771
So I see.

1:06:12.871 --> 1:06:14.404
Mother, I...

1:06:15.337 --> 1:06:17.870
What on earth do you think you are doing?

1:06:18.204 --> 1:06:20.403
It's just a dress Mother.

1:06:22.236 --> 1:06:23.103
You look like one of

1:06:23.103 --> 1:06:25.469
the girls who frequent the men's clubs.

1:06:26.503 --> 1:06:26.936
Mother,

1:06:28.469 --> 1:06:29.369
I am changing.

1:06:30.169 --> 1:06:31.335
You need to understand that.

1:06:32.335 --> 1:06:35.501
You are a little girl playing dress up.

1:06:37.901 --> 1:06:39.667
Now, take it off

1:06:39.667 --> 1:06:41.334
I don't want to see you in that again.

1:06:41.801 --> 1:06:42.800
No, mother.

1:06:43.000 --> 1:06:44.800
This is the new me.

1:06:45.367 --> 1:06:46.733
And if you can't accept that,

1:06:46.967 --> 1:06:48.466
then we really don't

1:06:48.466 --> 1:06:50.033
have anything else to discuss.

1:06:50.233 --> 1:06:52.232
How dare you talk to me in that way?

1:06:53.166 --> 1:06:54.499
Your father is going to hear about this

1:06:54.499 --> 1:06:55.632
and then you will be sorry.

1:06:55.699 --> 1:06:58.532
Stop trying to turn me into you.

1:07:00.598 --> 1:07:02.298
I want more from my life

1:07:02.498 --> 1:07:04.064
than what you have,

1:07:04.064 --> 1:07:05.431
and I'm sorry, mother,

1:07:05.797 --> 1:07:07.031
but if this was my life,

1:07:07.564 --> 1:07:09.130
I would kill myself.

1:07:13.630 --> 1:07:14.163
Vivian.

1:07:22.528 --> 1:07:23.295
I should go.

1:07:29.961 --> 1:07:35.327
Ah, Jimmy, hey, pass me that wrench.

1:07:37.393 --> 1:07:40.893
OK, but it's midnight dad I gotta go.

1:07:41.726 --> 1:07:43.459
Whoa, whoa, whoa, woah.

1:07:45.192 --> 1:07:46.659
Help me up.

1:07:49.458 --> 1:07:50.991
Where the hell do you think you're going?

1:07:50.991 --> 1:07:52.091
To meet my friends, I told you.

1:07:53.024 --> 1:07:54.124
Not tonight.

1:07:55.124 --> 1:07:55.757
Dad.

1:07:55.991 --> 1:07:56.991
I said not tonight.

1:07:56.991 --> 1:07:57.757
I need you here.

1:08:00.657 --> 1:08:01.857
I don't want to work here, dad.

1:08:03.390 --> 1:08:04.356
I got other dreams

1:08:04.356 --> 1:08:04.989
that I want to achieve,

1:08:04.989 --> 1:08:06.189
and I've been here all day.

1:08:07.622 --> 1:08:08.722
It ain't like I'm getting paid.

1:08:09.189 --> 1:08:10.655
You have a roof over your head

1:08:10.822 --> 1:08:12.089
and hot meals on the table.

1:08:12.089 --> 1:08:13.222
I'm your son.

1:08:14.388 --> 1:08:15.721
I ain't some employee.

1:08:15.921 --> 1:08:16.821
Don't you want more for me?

1:08:16.888 --> 1:08:17.587
What I want is for

1:08:17.621 --> 1:08:18.388
you to watch your mouth

1:08:18.388 --> 1:08:19.220
and get back to work.

1:08:20.121 --> 1:08:22.287
Dad, please.

1:08:23.487 --> 1:08:25.620
I've really got to see someone tonight.

1:08:25.853 --> 1:08:26.287
Who?

1:08:27.086 --> 1:08:29.020
Who is more important than your old man?

1:08:29.053 --> 1:08:30.185
You wouldn't understand.

1:08:31.185 --> 1:08:32.185
A broad,

1:08:33.252 --> 1:08:34.752
you want to skip out with some dame?

1:08:34.952 --> 1:08:37.551
This ain't some broad dad, she's special.

1:08:38.551 --> 1:08:39.318
She makes me feel

1:08:39.385 --> 1:08:40.550
I ain't the disappointment

1:08:40.550 --> 1:08:42.351
you keep reminding me I am.

1:08:42.351 --> 1:08:43.684
Jimmy. You ain't going.

1:08:44.184 --> 1:08:45.484
Yeah, watch me.

1:08:47.584 --> 1:08:48.717
Oh, what? What?

1:08:48.750 --> 1:08:49.950
You going to beat me again, huh?

1:08:50.983 --> 1:08:51.617
Old man,

1:08:51.617 --> 1:08:52.183
I ain't gonna let

1:08:52.183 --> 1:08:53.282
you knock me around anymore.

1:08:53.583 --> 1:08:54.515
Why you always got to see me

1:08:54.515 --> 1:08:55.449
as the bad guy, Jimmy.

1:08:56.148 --> 1:08:58.049
I'm just doing my best to guide you.

1:08:58.049 --> 1:08:59.515
Guide me?

1:09:00.749 --> 1:09:01.815
You mean destroy me.

1:09:02.582 --> 1:09:04.215
You know, I'd have more respect

1:09:04.215 --> 1:09:05.615
if you told me that you hated me.

1:09:05.648 --> 1:09:06.880
I don't hate you Jimmy.

1:09:07.781 --> 1:09:09.081
I just know what's best for you.

1:09:10.346 --> 1:09:11.147
You don't even know

1:09:11.147 --> 1:09:12.246
what's best for yourself.

1:09:13.147 --> 1:09:13.746
Jimmy!

1:09:13.746 --> 1:09:15.513
Get back here now!

1:09:18.612 --> 1:09:20.646
Veronica was like a whirlwind,

1:09:20.646 --> 1:09:23.078
she was already leaving her mark

1:09:23.211 --> 1:09:24.578
and what a mark it was.

1:09:25.545 --> 1:09:27.444
But that night as clouds

1:09:27.444 --> 1:09:28.944
rolled over the city,

1:09:28.944 --> 1:09:33.011
things will take a turn, a dark turn

1:09:33.011 --> 1:09:35.411
that will change everything.

1:09:40.309 --> 1:09:41.010
It's nice, isn't it.

1:09:42.976 --> 1:09:44.143
Us being able to do this.

1:09:45.876 --> 1:09:46.809
These past few weeks with you

1:09:46.809 --> 1:09:48.408
have been incredible Veronica.

1:09:48.908 --> 1:09:51.309
They sure have and you're right,

1:09:52.342 --> 1:09:53.242
it is nice.

1:09:54.407 --> 1:09:55.308
I just wish it could be

1:09:55.308 --> 1:09:57.141
like this all the time.

1:09:57.441 --> 1:09:57.808
Yeah.

1:09:59.341 --> 1:10:00.207
Wake up in the morning,

1:10:00.207 --> 1:10:01.474
take a ride on my bike

1:10:01.474 --> 1:10:02.374
wherever you want to go.

1:10:02.874 --> 1:10:03.639
Hollywood.

1:10:03.740 --> 1:10:04.874
Hollywood, it is.

1:10:05.940 --> 1:10:07.073
We could watch the sunset

1:10:07.073 --> 1:10:08.306
over the City of Angels.

1:10:10.206 --> 1:10:13.106
We could hold each other tightly wrapped

1:10:13.106 --> 1:10:15.039
up, nice and warm in a blanket.

1:10:21.737 --> 1:10:22.405
Do you think it could

1:10:22.405 --> 1:10:23.404
ever happen, Veronica?

1:10:25.671 --> 1:10:27.271
That you leave Cliff.

1:10:28.637 --> 1:10:31.270
If I had the money, the security.

1:10:32.969 --> 1:10:34.403
I would in a heartbeat Jimmy.

1:10:35.236 --> 1:10:36.436
I have a little saved.

1:10:37.403 --> 1:10:38.436
That's very sweet,

1:10:39.402 --> 1:10:40.469
but a little saved,

1:10:40.469 --> 1:10:42.135
won't get us very far.

1:10:43.135 --> 1:10:44.702
If only Cliff wasn't around.

1:10:45.835 --> 1:10:46.835
Yeah.

1:10:48.268 --> 1:10:49.101
If only.

1:10:55.300 --> 1:10:56.567
I don't think you're old enough

1:10:56.567 --> 1:10:57.833
to be drinking my liquor.

1:10:58.133 --> 1:10:59.032
Who the hell are you?

1:10:59.366 --> 1:11:00.398
The man of the house.

1:11:00.532 --> 1:11:01.898
Oh, Mr. Smart.

1:11:02.266 --> 1:11:05.066
Wait a minute, I know you,

1:11:05.365 --> 1:11:06.032
Oh, shit!

1:11:06.065 --> 1:11:07.698
it's you, the kid with the bat.

1:11:07.798 --> 1:11:08.398
Mister I didn't know

1:11:08.398 --> 1:11:09.298
you were Veronica's husband.

1:11:09.665 --> 1:11:10.465
You are dead!

1:11:10.998 --> 1:11:14.231
Get the hell of him Mr Smart, run Riff!

1:11:14.231 --> 1:11:15.364
Why are you in my house?

1:11:15.697 --> 1:11:16.531
We know your wife.

1:11:16.531 --> 1:11:17.864
She's teaching us, asking.

1:11:17.864 --> 1:11:18.830
Where's my wife?

1:11:19.264 --> 1:11:19.964
She's upstairs.

1:11:19.964 --> 1:11:20.996
Do you want me to go get her?

1:11:21.030 --> 1:11:21.930
Is she alone?

1:11:21.930 --> 1:11:22.830
Alone?

1:11:22.830 --> 1:11:25.196
Is my wife alone?

1:11:27.329 --> 1:11:28.496
Get the hell out of my house.

1:11:28.629 --> 1:11:31.129
Now, and you tell your friend

1:11:31.162 --> 1:11:33.662
I'll be seeing you again Riff, real soon.

1:11:42.894 --> 1:11:43.660
What the hell is this?

1:11:44.559 --> 1:11:47.559
Cliff, I didn't expect you home tonight.

1:11:47.826 --> 1:11:48.626
So I see.

1:11:50.425 --> 1:11:51.425
So when I'm gone, you

1:11:52.493 --> 1:11:54.291
have kids over to get drunk in my house.

1:11:55.725 --> 1:11:57.291
These are your new......

1:11:57.291 --> 1:11:58.425
friends?

1:11:58.657 --> 1:11:59.791
I told you Cliff,

1:12:00.325 --> 1:12:02.291
I'm giving them acting lessons.

1:12:02.458 --> 1:12:02.924
Oh, yeah.

1:12:04.091 --> 1:12:04.724
So what's this?

1:12:05.991 --> 1:12:07.591
Some kind of love scene

1:12:08.057 --> 1:12:08.724
in my bed?

1:12:09.057 --> 1:12:09.790
Excuse me?

1:12:09.790 --> 1:12:11.057
Jimmy, you should go.

1:12:11.790 --> 1:12:12.290
Yeah, Jimmy,

1:12:13.790 --> 1:12:16.989
maybe you should leave my bedroom,

1:12:18.022 --> 1:12:19.489
that I share with my wife.

1:12:19.522 --> 1:12:21.589
We were just talking, must

1:12:21.589 --> 1:12:22.855
you act like such a brute.

1:12:22.855 --> 1:12:25.121
Mr Smart, Veronica and I....

1:12:25.588 --> 1:12:28.321
There ain't no Veronica and you kid, now

1:12:28.421 --> 1:12:30.353
run home like a good little boy.

1:12:30.521 --> 1:12:31.187
Cliff.

1:12:33.387 --> 1:12:35.154
Get out of my house.

1:12:37.787 --> 1:12:40.886
I said, get out of my house.

1:12:44.652 --> 1:12:45.286
What's wrong?

1:12:45.985 --> 1:12:47.052
Do you not hear too good?

1:12:47.619 --> 1:12:49.552
I said, get out of my house.

1:12:51.585 --> 1:12:52.585
Cliff!

1:12:52.585 --> 1:12:56.584
Stop it, stop it.

1:13:02.916 --> 1:13:04.250
You've been looking at my wife?

1:13:04.816 --> 1:13:05.416
Touching her?

1:13:06.849 --> 1:13:08.582
If you're man enough to go near her,

1:13:09.148 --> 1:13:10.582
you're man enough to fight me.

1:13:10.982 --> 1:13:11.615
Cliff!

1:13:11.615 --> 1:13:12.215
If you don't leave him alone

1:13:12.215 --> 1:13:13.348
I'm going to call the police.

1:13:13.548 --> 1:13:14.682
I know your type, Jimmy.

1:13:15.115 --> 1:13:16.281
Oh, you think you can get

1:13:16.281 --> 1:13:17.415
what you want from her. Huh?

1:13:18.214 --> 1:13:19.314
Maybe you should stick

1:13:19.514 --> 1:13:21.114
to the slum side of town

1:13:21.114 --> 1:13:21.947
because I don't ever want

1:13:21.947 --> 1:13:23.114
to see you around here again.

1:13:25.180 --> 1:13:26.612
I'm going alright .

1:13:28.580 --> 1:13:29.046
I'm going.

1:13:29.680 --> 1:13:31.079
Stay away from my wife, Jimmy.

1:13:31.579 --> 1:13:33.346
Or I'll rip you to pieces,

1:13:33.346 --> 1:13:35.012
limb by limb,

1:13:35.012 --> 1:13:36.412
do we understand each other?

1:13:41.545 --> 1:13:42.745
How dare you?

1:13:43.344 --> 1:13:44.778
What the hell do you think you're doing?

1:13:44.778 --> 1:13:45.511
Don't.

1:13:46.977 --> 1:13:47.544
Don't talk to me.

1:13:47.577 --> 1:13:49.943
We were just working Cliff.

1:13:49.943 --> 1:13:51.277
And the kids downstairs?

1:13:51.277 --> 1:13:52.043
Students.

1:13:52.410 --> 1:13:53.443
The boy that attacked me

1:13:53.443 --> 1:13:55.043
with the bat, that was him

1:13:55.743 --> 1:13:57.643
that sewer rat was in my living room.

1:13:57.643 --> 1:13:59.776
But I'm sure he didn't know who you were.

1:14:00.041 --> 1:14:01.242
He could have killed me

1:14:01.242 --> 1:14:02.609
and what would you have done then, huh?

1:14:03.208 --> 1:14:04.475
One of your students attacks

1:14:04.475 --> 1:14:06.775
your husband, bashes his skull in.

1:14:06.775 --> 1:14:09.474
Jesus, what kind of company do you keep?

1:14:09.474 --> 1:14:11.207
Cliff wait.

1:14:11.207 --> 1:14:12.574
Do you want me divorce you,

1:14:12.574 --> 1:14:13.240
leave you with nothing?

1:14:13.240 --> 1:14:17.107
No Cliff, you're getting it all wrong.

1:14:22.106 --> 1:14:22.606
Good night,

1:14:23.806 --> 1:14:24.639
my dear wife.

1:14:40.270 --> 1:14:41.837
Now, here is the thing.

1:14:42.503 --> 1:14:43.736
This dame ain't going to do

1:14:43.736 --> 1:14:44.503
well in poverty.

1:14:45.136 --> 1:14:47.068
Poor is not a style she wears well.

1:14:47.603 --> 1:14:49.335
Well, this is the part

1:14:49.335 --> 1:14:51.369
you may not believe, but I assure you

1:14:51.502 --> 1:14:53.002
every word is true.

1:14:53.868 --> 1:14:55.368
Veronica slammed her face

1:14:55.368 --> 1:14:56.535
against the hard wall.

1:14:58.334 --> 1:14:59.168
Why?

1:14:59.934 --> 1:15:01.666
Well, after a quick phone

1:15:01.666 --> 1:15:03.700
call to a distraught Jimmy and a late

1:15:03.700 --> 1:15:04.700
night meeting arranged,

1:15:05.267 --> 1:15:06.800
a bruise would sell Veronica's

1:15:06.800 --> 1:15:08.067
story perfectly.

1:15:09.266 --> 1:15:09.866
Oh, God.

1:15:09.900 --> 1:15:12.032
Jimmy, Jimmy, are you OK?

1:15:12.166 --> 1:15:13.232
Son of a bitch.

1:15:14.732 --> 1:15:16.565
Your face, what did he do to your face?

1:15:16.965 --> 1:15:17.965
I told you, Jimmy.

1:15:18.132 --> 1:15:20.165
He's a violent brute of a man.

1:15:20.165 --> 1:15:21.931
I never wanted you to get hurt.

1:15:22.098 --> 1:15:23.031
Forget about me.

1:15:23.065 --> 1:15:24.898
We need to get you away from him.

1:15:24.931 --> 1:15:26.564
He can't do this to you.

1:15:26.831 --> 1:15:27.531
But how?

1:15:27.597 --> 1:15:29.897
Just, just leave him.

1:15:29.930 --> 1:15:31.463
Who cares if he leaves you with nothing?

1:15:31.496 --> 1:15:32.330
You have me.

1:15:32.362 --> 1:15:33.330
We have each other.

1:15:33.630 --> 1:15:34.830
Jimmy, you're young.

1:15:35.096 --> 1:15:36.329
You don't understand

1:15:36.329 --> 1:15:37.862
how much living can cost.

1:15:38.429 --> 1:15:40.462
We would be broke, unhappy

1:15:40.462 --> 1:15:42.594
and resenting each other in no time.

1:15:43.862 --> 1:15:44.827
Face it Jimmy.

1:15:45.562 --> 1:15:47.728
I'm stuck with him until my dying day.

1:15:47.761 --> 1:15:48.094
No.

1:15:49.494 --> 1:15:51.494
No, we have to think of another way.

1:15:51.627 --> 1:15:53.460
I can't live another day without you.

1:15:56.427 --> 1:15:57.160
I love you.

1:15:58.893 --> 1:15:59.526
Jimmy.

1:15:59.526 --> 1:16:01.893
Do you love me?

1:16:03.626 --> 1:16:05.559
Everything about this is wrong,

1:16:05.559 --> 1:16:08.225
and yet I have never felt more safe

1:16:08.225 --> 1:16:10.558
in anyone's arms as I do in yours.

1:16:10.991 --> 1:16:12.391
I want to go back there and show him

1:16:12.391 --> 1:16:13.458
who's the man around here.

1:16:16.023 --> 1:16:16.457
Jimmy,

1:16:18.224 --> 1:16:19.224
I just had a thought.

1:16:20.490 --> 1:16:21.457
A horrible thought.

1:16:22.723 --> 1:16:23.755
What is it, Veronica?

1:16:23.755 --> 1:16:24.255
Tell me.

1:16:25.989 --> 1:16:26.523
I couldn't.

1:16:27.389 --> 1:16:28.255
It's too awful.

1:16:28.255 --> 1:16:29.689
Yes, you can just

1:16:30.922 --> 1:16:31.621
just say it.

1:16:33.755 --> 1:16:35.455
Well, the way I see it

1:16:35.487 --> 1:16:37.688
is that only Cliff and the lack of money

1:16:37.688 --> 1:16:39.888
stands in the way of true happiness.

1:16:40.821 --> 1:16:41.287
OK.

1:16:42.487 --> 1:16:43.887
But if Cliff wasn't around,

1:16:43.887 --> 1:16:48.287
if Cliff died, I would get everything.

1:16:48.920 --> 1:16:50.420
We would have everything

1:16:50.420 --> 1:16:51.153
we need to have the

1:16:51.153 --> 1:16:52.452
perfect life together.

1:16:52.452 --> 1:16:53.818
But he isn't going anywhere.

1:16:53.852 --> 1:16:54.786
You saw him.

1:16:55.052 --> 1:16:56.619
He's as strong as an ox.

1:16:59.418 --> 1:17:00.318
Jimmy, I could pay,

1:17:01.218 --> 1:17:03.584
I could pay anyone who helps.

1:17:03.984 --> 1:17:05.151
I mean, think about it, Jimmy.

1:17:05.151 --> 1:17:06.084
This is New York.

1:17:06.117 --> 1:17:08.184
People die all the time.

1:17:08.784 --> 1:17:09.550
We could say that

1:17:09.550 --> 1:17:11.117
it was a robbery gone bad.

1:17:11.916 --> 1:17:13.350
Nobody would suspect you.

1:17:13.716 --> 1:17:14.350
Why would they?

1:17:14.350 --> 1:17:15.516
Nobody knows about us

1:17:15.516 --> 1:17:16.483
other than those two.

1:17:16.683 --> 1:17:19.316
And they won't say a word.

1:17:19.316 --> 1:17:20.916
I will make sure of that.

1:17:22.082 --> 1:17:23.082
Think about it, Jimmy.

1:17:24.182 --> 1:17:25.482
Think about it, this could work,

1:17:25.482 --> 1:17:26.615
we could be free.

1:17:27.548 --> 1:17:28.981
What are you saying, Veronica?

1:17:30.581 --> 1:17:30.981
Jimmy,

1:17:33.147 --> 1:17:34.514
I want you to kill my husband.

1:17:36.180 --> 1:17:39.180
(Thunder Crashes)

1:18:01.743 --> 1:18:03.876
What's all this?

1:18:03.876 --> 1:18:05.175
I did you the favour of packing

1:18:05.175 --> 1:18:06.243
your bags for you baby?

1:18:07.043 --> 1:18:08.709
You're absurd Cliff.

1:18:08.709 --> 1:18:10.076
Look, I don't want to hear it Veronica,

1:18:10.675 --> 1:18:12.175
seeing you sat on our bed with

1:18:12.175 --> 1:18:13.275
that kid was one thing,

1:18:13.842 --> 1:18:14.907
but it was the look in your eyes

1:18:14.907 --> 1:18:15.907
that told me everything.

1:18:16.141 --> 1:18:17.508
What are you talking about?

1:18:17.641 --> 1:18:19.641
The betrayal was in your eyes.

1:18:20.141 --> 1:18:21.108
I saw it the moment

1:18:21.108 --> 1:18:22.007
I walked in the bedroom.

1:18:22.141 --> 1:18:24.207
Oh, you're talking in circles Cliff.

1:18:24.207 --> 1:18:25.474
Why aren't you listening to me!

1:18:25.474 --> 1:18:26.573
Cliff!

1:18:26.573 --> 1:18:27.907
I want you gone Veronica.

1:18:28.040 --> 1:18:29.606
I am done.

1:18:29.606 --> 1:18:31.906
You lie, all you do is lie.

1:18:31.906 --> 1:18:33.739
I can't trust you, I can't trust a word

1:18:33.739 --> 1:18:34.839
that comes out of your mouth.

1:18:35.339 --> 1:18:36.939
You strung me along for years.

1:18:37.072 --> 1:18:38.239
You never had any intention

1:18:38.239 --> 1:18:39.105
of becoming a mother.

1:18:39.371 --> 1:18:40.172
I see that now.

1:18:40.172 --> 1:18:42.237
Now you're painting yourself

1:18:42.237 --> 1:18:44.071
as a victim Cliff.

1:18:44.071 --> 1:18:45.471
Again, you cheated.

1:18:45.504 --> 1:18:46.837
This isn't about that.

1:18:46.837 --> 1:18:49.103
Look I haven't got a future with you.

1:18:49.469 --> 1:18:51.137
I see that now baby, you've made

1:18:51.137 --> 1:18:52.237
that perfectly clear.

1:18:52.670 --> 1:18:54.370
You son of a bitch.

1:18:54.903 --> 1:18:55.903
Well if you think I'm

1:18:55.903 --> 1:18:57.503
walking away from this marriage

1:18:57.503 --> 1:19:00.036
with nothing but a few cases of clothing?

1:19:00.236 --> 1:19:01.202
Well, there it is.

1:19:01.369 --> 1:19:03.169
Money, belongings and things.

1:19:03.169 --> 1:19:04.135
That's all you care about,

1:19:04.135 --> 1:19:04.902
right, Veronica?

1:19:05.002 --> 1:19:06.335
You won't get away with this.

1:19:06.901 --> 1:19:08.768
Big words, but we both know that I will.

1:19:09.101 --> 1:19:11.068
You are making a mistake, Cliff.

1:19:12.134 --> 1:19:13.567
You know, um.

1:19:13.567 --> 1:19:14.200
That

1:19:15.367 --> 1:19:20.532
kid, Riff, the kid that was in my house.

1:19:21.366 --> 1:19:22.066
What about him?

1:19:22.766 --> 1:19:27.332
Look, just a pretty small world ain't it.

1:19:29.332 --> 1:19:30.532
Just one of the kids

1:19:30.532 --> 1:19:32.465
that you've been hopelessly

1:19:32.998 --> 1:19:34.464
flaunting yourself in front of

1:19:34.464 --> 1:19:36.364
like some cheap whore.

1:19:37.331 --> 1:19:38.297
Just happens to be

1:19:38.297 --> 1:19:39.297
the kid who attacks me.

1:19:40.364 --> 1:19:41.397
What are you saying?

1:19:43.097 --> 1:19:44.463
Did you put him up to that Veronica?

1:19:45.530 --> 1:19:45.996
God,

1:19:47.696 --> 1:19:49.296
how could you even think that?

1:19:49.929 --> 1:19:50.228
Oh,

1:19:51.329 --> 1:19:52.462
well, here we go.

1:19:53.395 --> 1:19:54.762
Bring on the tears.

1:19:55.862 --> 1:19:56.728
Why don't you save them

1:19:56.728 --> 1:19:58.094
for one of your teenage lovers?

1:19:58.094 --> 1:19:59.827
I'm sure they'll eat em up.

1:19:59.827 --> 1:20:02.427
You're insane, sick,

1:20:02.427 --> 1:20:03.661
thinking that I would

1:20:03.661 --> 1:20:04.660
sleep with a student.

1:20:04.960 --> 1:20:05.594
You know, the fact

1:20:05.594 --> 1:20:06.827
that you even suggested

1:20:06.827 --> 1:20:09.393
it says more about you.

1:20:09.460 --> 1:20:10.925
Well, I know you, Veronica,

1:20:10.925 --> 1:20:12.326
and I know when you lie.

1:20:12.359 --> 1:20:13.726
You cannot divorce me.

1:20:13.893 --> 1:20:15.126
Oh, really?

1:20:15.526 --> 1:20:16.725
Why don't you watch me?

1:20:17.159 --> 1:20:18.725
Cliff, I never slept with anyone else.

1:20:18.725 --> 1:20:19.592
Lies!

1:20:19.592 --> 1:20:21.192
I had nothing to do with Riffs attack.

1:20:21.192 --> 1:20:21.758
Lies!

1:20:22.091 --> 1:20:22.891
Please wait.

1:20:23.058 --> 1:20:24.724
We just ,we got to talk.

1:20:25.023 --> 1:20:26.224
I'm done talking.

1:20:26.224 --> 1:20:27.157
No Cliff, please.

1:20:27.157 --> 1:20:28.523
I said I'm done Veronica.

1:20:28.523 --> 1:20:29.290
Please Cliff, I have

1:20:29.290 --> 1:20:30.457
something to tell you.

1:20:30.924 --> 1:20:34.255
Oh, Veronica, she never misses a trick.

1:20:38.423 --> 1:20:39.056
Cliff.

1:20:41.822 --> 1:20:42.955
I'm pregnant.

1:21:00.886 --> 1:21:03.019
Where the hell do you think you're going?

1:21:03.019 --> 1:21:04.352
I told you,

1:21:04.352 --> 1:21:05.719
I have a date with my lady, tonight.

1:21:06.085 --> 1:21:07.452
Jimmy, you've been seeing this woman

1:21:07.452 --> 1:21:09.252
for the last three weeks, but tonight,

1:21:10.385 --> 1:21:11.684
tonight, your working.

1:21:11.684 --> 1:21:12.285
Dad please,

1:21:12.285 --> 1:21:13.518
I've really got to see her tonight.

1:21:13.518 --> 1:21:13.818
Jimmy.

1:21:13.885 --> 1:21:15.050
Who the hell is this woman?

1:21:16.916 --> 1:21:18.351
Just somebody, you don't know her.

1:21:18.351 --> 1:21:19.484
Well, whoever she is,

1:21:19.784 --> 1:21:20.984
she's got you acting like a damn fool.

1:21:25.016 --> 1:21:26.083
Why dad?

1:21:27.148 --> 1:21:27.816
Because I'm in love.

1:21:29.349 --> 1:21:30.249
Because I don't piss my life

1:21:30.249 --> 1:21:31.148
down the drain like you.

1:21:32.815 --> 1:21:34.082
You think I never knew love

1:21:34.082 --> 1:21:34.848
before your mother.

1:21:36.115 --> 1:21:38.014
I remember falling all over myself

1:21:38.014 --> 1:21:40.448
for this one broad.

1:21:40.448 --> 1:21:41.081
Patricia.

1:21:42.746 --> 1:21:45.280
Oh, I never seen a lady like that,

1:21:45.280 --> 1:21:49.280
and make no mistake, she was a real lady.

1:21:53.779 --> 1:21:57.478
I fell so hard for her, my first love.

1:22:01.512 --> 1:22:02.045
At eighteen,

1:22:02.045 --> 1:22:04.443
I started planning my future around her,

1:22:04.511 --> 1:22:06.011
believing everything she said.

1:22:07.977 --> 1:22:08.844
Life was perfect.

1:22:11.910 --> 1:22:12.477
I was happy

1:22:14.643 --> 1:22:16.175
and happiness was hard to come by you know

1:22:16.743 --> 1:22:17.743
when I was a teenager.

1:22:20.842 --> 1:22:24.475
And one day, out of the blue,

1:22:27.741 --> 1:22:28.341
I found out she got

1:22:28.341 --> 1:22:29.341
married to another guy.

1:22:33.374 --> 1:22:34.773
I had no idea that she was

1:22:34.773 --> 1:22:35.374
stepping out on me,

1:22:35.374 --> 1:22:37.540
and she she never let slip.

1:22:39.340 --> 1:22:40.740
The pain was too much.

1:22:42.639 --> 1:22:44.339
I was left picking up the pieces.

1:22:46.706 --> 1:22:48.839
Then I met your mother.

1:22:51.572 --> 1:22:53.071
Look, it ain't worth it,

1:22:53.071 --> 1:22:54.704
just just focus on your work.

1:22:54.871 --> 1:22:55.504
That is something

1:22:55.504 --> 1:22:56.504
that will give you a future.

1:22:59.304 --> 1:23:01.337
I don't want to be like you dad,

1:23:02.737 --> 1:23:03.637
I'm sorry,

1:23:03.637 --> 1:23:05.136
but I have bigger plans for myself.

1:23:05.370 --> 1:23:08.769
Oh, yeah, what plans?

1:23:10.536 --> 1:23:12.934
Plans. Plans.

1:23:13.735 --> 1:23:15.468
You're lliving in La La Land, Jimmy.

1:23:16.235 --> 1:23:17.434
You think somebody like

1:23:17.434 --> 1:23:19.001
you becomes a somebody?

1:23:20.168 --> 1:23:21.568
They don't.

1:23:21.568 --> 1:23:23.067
Look around you, Jimmy.

1:23:25.400 --> 1:23:26.834
Your whole future is mapped out.

1:23:26.867 --> 1:23:27.833
Well, I want more.

1:23:28.767 --> 1:23:31.466
You're a fool Jimmy Flynn,

1:23:31.466 --> 1:23:33.433
and this world ain't kind to fools.

1:23:33.532 --> 1:23:34.199
I love her.

1:23:37.732 --> 1:23:39.332
I love her dad.

1:23:40.332 --> 1:23:41.198
You're sixteen.

1:23:41.198 --> 1:23:43.130
You have no idea what love is.

1:23:44.130 --> 1:23:47.331
Now get ready to be down at the garage

1:23:47.331 --> 1:23:50.764
at six thirty, it's an all nighter again.

1:23:50.764 --> 1:23:52.597
Dad.

1:23:52.996 --> 1:23:54.496
Please.

1:23:56.130 --> 1:23:57.429
I'm dressed.

1:24:17.260 --> 1:24:19.660
I said six thirty.

1:24:24.959 --> 1:24:25.692
Jimmy.

1:24:25.692 --> 1:24:26.291
Jimmy!

1:24:40.424 --> 1:24:43.023
Well, it really is beautiful here, Jimmy.

1:24:43.490 --> 1:24:44.423
I can see why you like

1:24:44.423 --> 1:24:45.523
to come here and think.

1:24:46.690 --> 1:24:48.123
It's hard to find peace in a city

1:24:48.123 --> 1:24:49.056
that's always moving.

1:24:51.056 --> 1:24:52.022
But when I was little,

1:24:52.222 --> 1:24:55.722
my mom used to bring me up here.

1:24:57.487 --> 1:24:59.221
She used to say that we had to pretend

1:24:59.221 --> 1:25:00.454
that we're not in the

1:25:00.454 --> 1:25:01.588
big city anymore, but

1:25:02.621 --> 1:25:03.787
just on some small island

1:25:04.820 --> 1:25:07.587
away from everything and everyone.

1:25:09.187 --> 1:25:11.386
Your mother sounded like a smart lady.

1:25:12.119 --> 1:25:13.219
They spoke for hours.

1:25:13.919 --> 1:25:15.352
It was like nothing else mattered.

1:25:15.486 --> 1:25:17.419
The question haunting both of them had

1:25:17.419 --> 1:25:18.385
simply vanished.

1:25:19.684 --> 1:25:21.152
Veronica and Jimmy felt free

1:25:21.152 --> 1:25:22.518
and opened up their souls.

1:25:23.251 --> 1:25:24.884
Jimmy spoke about how his mother

1:25:24.884 --> 1:25:26.151
had skipped out on us.

1:25:28.084 --> 1:25:30.184
I've never felt so unwanted before.

1:25:31.317 --> 1:25:33.483
I remember crying my bedroom days

1:25:33.483 --> 1:25:35.782
just waiting for her to return.

1:25:36.183 --> 1:25:38.316
He went on to say how he hated his

1:25:38.316 --> 1:25:39.483
father for making her leave us

1:25:40.082 --> 1:25:41.616
and how he dreamed every day of

1:25:41.616 --> 1:25:43.349
of travelling the world,

1:25:43.882 --> 1:25:45.282
seeing things that you can only see

1:25:45.282 --> 1:25:46.848
in Life magazine.

1:25:47.348 --> 1:25:48.581
Veronica was playful.

1:25:49.348 --> 1:25:50.781
She laughed and giggled like

1:25:50.781 --> 1:25:52.781
she was experiencing her first crush.

1:25:53.947 --> 1:25:56.080
She spoke about how she

1:25:56.080 --> 1:25:57.513
dreamed to become a movie star.

1:25:58.080 --> 1:25:59.080
You know, I wanted it

1:25:59.080 --> 1:26:00.713
ever since I was a little girl.

1:26:00.913 --> 1:26:02.046
And now she fell in love

1:26:02.046 --> 1:26:03.379
with the pictures on the big screen when

1:26:03.379 --> 1:26:04.946
my father would take me

1:26:04.946 --> 1:26:06.478
to watch one movie a week.

1:26:07.079 --> 1:26:08.478
I remember sitting there

1:26:08.478 --> 1:26:11.112
and looking up at that big screen

1:26:11.112 --> 1:26:13.745
and just wanting to walk right into it,

1:26:14.045 --> 1:26:15.644
imagining that if I did,

1:26:15.943 --> 1:26:17.277
I would be transported

1:26:17.277 --> 1:26:19.111
right there into that movie picture.

1:26:19.277 --> 1:26:20.210
Jimmy laughed.

1:26:20.777 --> 1:26:23.943
Veronica laughed, to anybody who saw them,

1:26:23.977 --> 1:26:24.577
they would have looked

1:26:24.577 --> 1:26:26.410
like the vision of happiness.

1:26:26.910 --> 1:26:29.143
Do you believe in one man

1:26:29.143 --> 1:26:30.942
and one woman together forever?

1:26:32.309 --> 1:26:33.041
Of course I do.

1:26:34.309 --> 1:26:35.142
If it's right.

1:26:36.875 --> 1:26:37.641
It's forever.

1:26:39.708 --> 1:26:40.608
Then maybe it's true.

1:26:42.308 --> 1:26:43.441
Maybe there is one

1:26:43.441 --> 1:26:44.773
perfect person out there,

1:26:44.773 --> 1:26:46.174
I mean, I know I believe that.

1:26:47.207 --> 1:26:48.639
I know that I hurt so much

1:26:48.639 --> 1:26:50.005
when I'm not with you.

1:26:50.340 --> 1:26:51.473
An unbearable pain.

1:26:53.005 --> 1:26:54.673
That has to mean something, right?

1:26:57.371 --> 1:26:58.839
That's love, Jimmy,

1:26:59.805 --> 1:27:01.138
the pain of love.

1:27:01.405 --> 1:27:03.205
Jimmy was feeling the pain of love,

1:27:03.205 --> 1:27:03.737
alright.

1:27:04.737 --> 1:27:06.671
All he saw was her.

1:27:07.304 --> 1:27:08.571
All I see is you.

1:27:09.537 --> 1:27:11.004
And all I see is you Jimmy.

1:27:11.404 --> 1:27:13.837
And as the sun started

1:27:13.837 --> 1:27:15.436
to set on a perfect day

1:27:15.436 --> 1:27:16.570
in a perfect bubble.

1:27:17.536 --> 1:27:18.303
The question.

1:27:19.403 --> 1:27:22.502
That question came back, and this time,

1:27:23.169 --> 1:27:24.635
the dame wanted an answer.

1:27:25.535 --> 1:27:26.002
You know,

1:27:27.434 --> 1:27:29.868
you never did say much after my suggestion

1:27:29.868 --> 1:27:32.767
that night, erasing Cliff permanently

1:27:33.967 --> 1:27:36.000
cementing us together eternally.

1:27:37.034 --> 1:27:40.032
At that moment, a reality hit Jimmy.

1:27:40.032 --> 1:27:41.600
His mood changed

1:27:41.600 --> 1:27:43.599
and he turned away from her.

1:27:45.432 --> 1:27:46.332
I can't do it.

1:27:47.732 --> 1:27:49.565
I can't kill Cliff.

1:27:49.565 --> 1:27:49.932
Jimmy.

1:27:49.932 --> 1:27:50.632
Trust me,

1:27:51.698 --> 1:27:52.931
I want to get you as far away

1:27:52.931 --> 1:27:54.630
from that son of a bitch as possible,

1:27:54.630 --> 1:27:56.464
but killing him.

1:27:56.798 --> 1:27:57.198
I mean,

1:27:58.231 --> 1:27:59.496
there's got to be another way.

1:27:59.664 --> 1:28:01.397
There is no other way, Jimmy.

1:28:02.464 --> 1:28:03.996
The only way to get the money

1:28:03.996 --> 1:28:05.230
that we need to leave is

1:28:06.396 --> 1:28:07.929
is to make sure that Cliff is dead.

1:28:08.329 --> 1:28:09.728
No, I refuse to believe

1:28:09.728 --> 1:28:11.396
that we still can't be together

1:28:11.396 --> 1:28:12.762
and run away together.

1:28:12.995 --> 1:28:14.462
People do it all the time.

1:28:14.495 --> 1:28:16.562
It won't work, Jimmy.

1:28:17.162 --> 1:28:17.995
We'll be living on

1:28:17.995 --> 1:28:19.428
the streets in no time.

1:28:25.360 --> 1:28:25.994
I love you.

1:28:26.527 --> 1:28:27.827
With things falling apart.

1:28:28.427 --> 1:28:29.527
Veronica, worked fast

1:28:29.527 --> 1:28:31.026
to get Jimmy back on track.

1:28:33.593 --> 1:28:36.192
Jimmy, you know,

1:28:36.192 --> 1:28:37.725
I wasn't going to tell you this,

1:28:37.759 --> 1:28:40.692
I didn't want to frighten you.

1:28:40.692 --> 1:28:42.225
Veronica, what are you talking about?

1:28:44.325 --> 1:28:44.691
Jimmy.

1:28:46.491 --> 1:28:47.157
I'm pregnant.

1:28:50.224 --> 1:28:50.590
What?

1:28:52.490 --> 1:28:54.423
I'm having your child, Jimmy,

1:28:54.423 --> 1:28:56.823
you're going to be a father.

1:28:58.089 --> 1:28:59.523
A father?

1:29:00.589 --> 1:29:02.489
We can do this Jimmy.

1:29:02.489 --> 1:29:06.088
You, me, our child, a family,

1:29:06.621 --> 1:29:07.788
a family, Jimmy.

1:29:08.388 --> 1:29:10.188
I know how much you've always

1:29:10.188 --> 1:29:12.821
wanted to be part of a real family.

1:29:13.721 --> 1:29:15.021
Jimmy arranged the pieces

1:29:15.021 --> 1:29:16.320
of information in his head,

1:29:17.219 --> 1:29:18.387
the thoughts of a future

1:29:18.387 --> 1:29:19.487
with the woman he loved.

1:29:20.153 --> 1:29:22.486
I know it's a big step Jimmy,

1:29:23.419 --> 1:29:25.186
but I know that with our love,

1:29:26.019 --> 1:29:28.352
we can do anything we want.

1:29:29.919 --> 1:29:30.585
I love you.

1:29:31.818 --> 1:29:33.285
I love you so much.

1:29:35.418 --> 1:29:36.684
And?

1:29:39.217 --> 1:29:40.250
Jimmy?

1:29:42.050 --> 1:29:42.517
I'll do it.

1:29:45.050 --> 1:29:45.916
I'll kill Cliff.

1:29:48.583 --> 1:29:50.216
Another victory for Veronica

1:29:50.816 --> 1:29:52.782
and now, well,

1:29:53.949 --> 1:29:55.415
the deal was sealed.

1:29:55.415 --> 1:29:56.882
Cliff Smart

1:29:58.148 --> 1:29:59.281
would have to die.

1:30:09.080 --> 1:30:10.147
She asked you to kill him?

1:30:10.746 --> 1:30:11.446
Things are bad Riff.

1:30:12.580 --> 1:30:14.079
He's beaten her so badly,

1:30:14.079 --> 1:30:15.812
I mean, you saw the bruises on her face.

1:30:15.879 --> 1:30:16.512
But killing him?

1:30:17.612 --> 1:30:18.879
He ain't a good guy.

1:30:19.679 --> 1:30:20.678
We ain't talking about

1:30:20.678 --> 1:30:21.912
some churchgoing hero

1:30:21.912 --> 1:30:23.145
here, we're talking about a man

1:30:23.344 --> 1:30:24.844
who lays his hands on a woman.

1:30:25.045 --> 1:30:27.244
Oh, man, you got it bad Jimmy.

1:30:27.244 --> 1:30:29.277
I mean, loving someone is one thing but

1:30:29.544 --> 1:30:30.544
bumping off the competition?

1:30:30.544 --> 1:30:32.244
Well, that's cockeyed.

1:30:32.244 --> 1:30:33.010
She's pregnant.

1:30:33.643 --> 1:30:34.710
With a baby?

1:30:34.710 --> 1:30:37.175
No with a flock of sheep Riff.

1:30:37.510 --> 1:30:39.509
Jesus Jimmy. A baby?

1:30:39.843 --> 1:30:41.675
Are you sure it ain't her old mans?

1:30:41.675 --> 1:30:42.409
It's mine.

1:30:42.409 --> 1:30:43.942
Her and Cliff don't,

1:30:45.242 --> 1:30:46.508
you know, practice anymore?

1:30:47.842 --> 1:30:48.541
She's offered to pay

1:30:48.541 --> 1:30:50.108
a thousand bucks to anyone who helps.

1:30:50.241 --> 1:30:50.708
Woah!

1:30:50.708 --> 1:30:52.141
That's life changing.

1:30:52.141 --> 1:30:53.174
I need you to help me.

1:30:53.607 --> 1:30:55.074
I can't do this alone.

1:30:55.174 --> 1:30:56.707
I don't know Jimmy, murder?

1:30:56.707 --> 1:30:58.073
We would get the chair if we get caught.

1:30:58.173 --> 1:30:59.173
We ain't gonna get caught.

1:30:59.173 --> 1:31:00.307
Why can't she do it herself?

1:31:00.307 --> 1:31:02.005
I mean the lady looks like she would be

1:31:02.005 --> 1:31:02.540
with a meat cleaver.

1:31:02.540 --> 1:31:04.106
The first person, the police suspect

1:31:04.106 --> 1:31:05.306
is always the partner.

1:31:07.439 --> 1:31:08.472
This way, Veronica

1:31:08.472 --> 1:31:09.839
could be at the school or,

1:31:09.839 --> 1:31:12.305
or out when the murder takes place

1:31:12.305 --> 1:31:14.305
and nobody will suspect us, because,

1:31:15.638 --> 1:31:16.404
why would they?

1:31:16.737 --> 1:31:18.271
This is crazy talk.

1:31:18.271 --> 1:31:19.103
We're talking about

1:31:19.103 --> 1:31:20.271
murdering Cliff Smart.

1:31:20.371 --> 1:31:21.603
Why can't she just leave him?

1:31:21.670 --> 1:31:22.704
Because he'll take everything

1:31:22.704 --> 1:31:24.003
and leave her with nothing.

1:31:24.003 --> 1:31:26.303
She would be out on her ass

1:31:26.303 --> 1:31:27.536
with no place to call home.

1:31:27.736 --> 1:31:29.036
Jeez.

1:31:31.869 --> 1:31:35.369
If Cliff dies, Veronica gets everything,

1:31:36.102 --> 1:31:37.868
and Cliff is a very wealthy man,

1:31:37.868 --> 1:31:39.168
even more so when he dies.

1:31:39.168 --> 1:31:39.968
And then

1:31:41.234 --> 1:31:42.334
Veronica gets it all.

1:31:45.700 --> 1:31:49.100
We could do this, I know we could

1:31:49.100 --> 1:31:50.000
and just think then we can

1:31:50.000 --> 1:31:51.066
all get the hell out of here.

1:31:51.433 --> 1:31:53.666
What, the two of us and you new lady?

1:31:53.666 --> 1:31:55.898
Sure, why not, go to Hollywood,

1:31:55.932 --> 1:31:57.332
start again?

1:31:57.332 --> 1:31:59.632
Riff you've been living on the streets,

1:31:59.632 --> 1:32:00.299
you said it yourself,

1:32:00.299 --> 1:32:02.398
you can't keep doing what you're doing.

1:32:03.630 --> 1:32:04.398
This could get you out.

1:32:04.965 --> 1:32:05.398
Yeah.

1:32:06.098 --> 1:32:07.198
It's just that easy.

1:32:08.031 --> 1:32:08.764
And I could get away

1:32:08.764 --> 1:32:11.764
from my dad, for good.

1:32:14.362 --> 1:32:15.862
I'm not built for this life.

1:32:17.330 --> 1:32:18.296
I deserve more.

1:32:20.762 --> 1:32:21.596
I deserve love.

1:32:22.129 --> 1:32:25.295
In that moment the boys face a choice.

1:32:25.295 --> 1:32:28.062
Two sixteen year olds wrestling with life

1:32:29.061 --> 1:32:29.728
and death.

1:32:30.628 --> 1:32:31.994
A thousand dollars Riff,

1:32:31.994 --> 1:32:33.693
a thousand dollars.

1:32:34.394 --> 1:32:36.427
No, no, I can't do this,

1:32:36.427 --> 1:32:37.594
I'm sorry, Jimmy.

1:32:37.660 --> 1:32:38.660
You need to look in a mirror.

1:32:38.693 --> 1:32:39.427
This isn't you.

1:32:39.460 --> 1:32:40.660
Riff I ain't got a choice,

1:32:41.393 --> 1:32:42.860
I gotta defend the woman I love.

1:32:43.026 --> 1:32:43.659
You're just listening

1:32:43.759 --> 1:32:44.626
to what she's telling you.

1:32:44.659 --> 1:32:45.626
How do you know what

1:32:45.626 --> 1:32:46.992
she's saying is true?

1:32:47.392 --> 1:32:48.392
What are you trying to say Riff?

1:32:48.392 --> 1:32:49.525
Oh, come on, Jimmy,

1:32:49.525 --> 1:32:51.291
you know I like Veronica,

1:32:51.291 --> 1:32:52.791
she's a fun time with a good heart.

1:32:52.958 --> 1:32:54.391
But that woman ain't no saint Jimmy.

1:32:54.491 --> 1:32:56.058
Hey don't disrespect her Riff!

1:32:56.058 --> 1:32:57.924
Do you know for sure she's pregnant?

1:32:58.324 --> 1:32:59.624
Do you know that cliff really beats her?

1:32:59.791 --> 1:33:00.724
Riff, you saw the guy,

1:33:00.724 --> 1:33:02.023
you saw how angry he got

1:33:02.023 --> 1:33:03.690
you said that his head nearly exploded.

1:33:03.823 --> 1:33:05.190
I'm just saying, it's a lot to risk

1:33:05.190 --> 1:33:06.255
without all the information.

1:33:06.255 --> 1:33:07.223
Information.

1:33:07.255 --> 1:33:08.556
Who are you, a detective?

1:33:09.489 --> 1:33:11.289
I ain't going to say anything,

1:33:12.089 --> 1:33:13.755
but I can not be involved,

1:33:13.755 --> 1:33:16.088
and I pray you don't go through this

1:33:16.955 --> 1:33:17.688
Riff, wait.

1:33:19.288 --> 1:33:20.421
What, Jimmy?

1:33:21.621 --> 1:33:23.353
I need your gun.

1:33:24.254 --> 1:33:25.421
If you ain't gonna help,

1:33:25.421 --> 1:33:26.887
you can at least do that.

1:33:27.120 --> 1:33:28.219
I ain't got it on me.

1:33:28.353 --> 1:33:29.387
I let a friend borrow it.

1:33:29.387 --> 1:33:29.719
Riff.

1:33:30.487 --> 1:33:32.253
Damn you Jimmy Flynn for telling me this.

1:33:34.719 --> 1:33:35.386
Fine.

1:33:36.318 --> 1:33:37.786
The night you're going to do the deed

1:33:38.085 --> 1:33:39.552
I'll meet you before

1:33:39.552 --> 1:33:41.018
and let you borrow it.

1:33:44.684 --> 1:33:45.751
Thank you.

1:33:47.518 --> 1:33:49.484
You know, you really are my best friend.

1:33:49.651 --> 1:33:51.050
Whatever you say Jimmy.

1:33:51.117 --> 1:33:51.784
I got to go.

1:33:52.584 --> 1:33:53.650
My future is calling.

1:33:55.782 --> 1:33:56.883
They say the road to hell

1:33:56.883 --> 1:33:58.349
is paved with good intentions,

1:33:58.349 --> 1:34:00.683
and maybe that's the best way to describe

1:34:00.683 --> 1:34:01.482
Jimmy's decision.

1:34:02.116 --> 1:34:04.715
Cliff was now a dead man walking.

1:34:04.715 --> 1:34:07.682
That night, out clearing his head,

1:34:07.682 --> 1:34:09.548
Cliff stops dead in his tracks

1:34:09.548 --> 1:34:11.114
when he sees Riff in front of him

1:34:11.114 --> 1:34:12.148
warming his hands.

1:34:15.114 --> 1:34:15.647
You!

1:34:15.781 --> 1:34:18.680
After a moment Riff's eyes lock on Cliff.

1:34:19.480 --> 1:34:20.447
It was like a showdown

1:34:20.447 --> 1:34:21.380
from the Wild West.

1:34:22.013 --> 1:34:23.280
But who would flinch first?

1:34:23.513 --> 1:34:25.779
We still have unfinished business, kid.

1:34:26.279 --> 1:34:27.079
Mr. Smart.

1:34:41.677 --> 1:34:42.943
It's so different.

1:34:43.344 --> 1:34:44.277
You look...

1:34:44.543 --> 1:34:45.210
Glamorous?

1:34:45.710 --> 1:34:46.510
Older.

1:34:46.843 --> 1:34:47.843
Well, good.

1:34:48.143 --> 1:34:49.243
Hopefully people start

1:34:49.243 --> 1:34:50.376
to see me as a grown-up

1:34:50.376 --> 1:34:51.876
rather than some dumb kid.

1:34:52.709 --> 1:34:54.575
Has your mother see your transformation?

1:34:55.509 --> 1:34:57.075
Oh, she's out.

1:34:57.608 --> 1:34:58.875
She'll see it when she gets back.

1:34:58.907 --> 1:35:00.108
I'm sure she'll think it's fine.

1:35:01.008 --> 1:35:02.708
Have you met your mother?

1:35:02.708 --> 1:35:03.741
And Vivian,

1:35:03.741 --> 1:35:05.907
how did you manage to afford this?

1:35:05.941 --> 1:35:08.607
Oh, Veronica paid, she said,

1:35:08.607 --> 1:35:11.340
I remind her of her when she was my age.

1:35:11.673 --> 1:35:12.573
She's always getting me

1:35:12.573 --> 1:35:14.106
little gifts we're even talking

1:35:14.106 --> 1:35:15.773
about going to Hollywood together.

1:35:16.239 --> 1:35:17.206
Hollywood?

1:35:17.206 --> 1:35:18.139
Vivian,

1:35:18.306 --> 1:35:20.239
your mother nearly has heart failure

1:35:20.239 --> 1:35:21.705
every time we go camping,

1:35:22.038 --> 1:35:24.271
and that's usually in your backyard.

1:35:25.438 --> 1:35:27.004
Do you think I should go blond?

1:35:27.603 --> 1:35:29.704
I mean, Veronica says the dark suits me,

1:35:29.704 --> 1:35:31.537
but I'm not so sure.

1:35:31.537 --> 1:35:32.670
You do realise that

1:35:32.670 --> 1:35:33.937
all that comes out your mouth now

1:35:33.937 --> 1:35:35.570
is about Jimmy's new girlfriend.

1:35:35.603 --> 1:35:36.969
Girlfriend is a stretch Betty.

1:35:38.103 --> 1:35:39.702
He's just some teenage crush.

1:35:40.303 --> 1:35:41.269
Veronica and I,

1:35:41.568 --> 1:35:43.036
we have a true connection, like

1:35:43.402 --> 1:35:44.769
on a deeper level, you know.

1:35:45.602 --> 1:35:46.535
Not really.

1:35:46.668 --> 1:35:48.168
Plus, it's nice to have grown up

1:35:48.168 --> 1:35:49.501
conversations for a change.

1:35:51.234 --> 1:35:53.168
So what am I just some dumb kid?

1:35:53.300 --> 1:35:55.367
No, you're just different.

1:35:55.800 --> 1:35:57.834
What we have is our thing and what I have

1:35:57.834 --> 1:35:59.333
with Veronica, is...

1:36:00.000 --> 1:36:00.733
Better?

1:36:00.733 --> 1:36:01.500
Betty.

1:36:01.900 --> 1:36:03.532
You promised that I wouldn't be

1:36:03.532 --> 1:36:05.499
replaced by your new glamorous friend,

1:36:05.799 --> 1:36:07.799
but I hardly see you anymore.

1:36:07.832 --> 1:36:09.332
Why aren't you happy for me?

1:36:09.599 --> 1:36:10.565
You know what, you're supposed

1:36:10.565 --> 1:36:12.032
to be my best friend.

1:36:12.032 --> 1:36:13.165
When it suits you.

1:36:13.165 --> 1:36:15.531
I'm changing Betty and you better get

1:36:15.531 --> 1:36:16.264
used to it or sit down

1:36:16.264 --> 1:36:17.731
and stay the hell out of my way.

1:36:18.098 --> 1:36:19.231
Goodbye, Vivian.

1:36:20.231 --> 1:36:21.630
I know when I'm not wanted.

1:36:22.697 --> 1:36:24.063
I just didn't think it would be you

1:36:24.063 --> 1:36:25.630
that didnt want me.

1:36:26.263 --> 1:36:27.830
Betty!

1:36:28.896 --> 1:36:30.129
Betty?

1:36:33.262 --> 1:36:34.495
Kids.

1:36:39.327 --> 1:36:41.827
My name? Oh,

1:36:43.561 --> 1:36:46.127
it's Vivian, Vivian Pierce.

1:36:46.527 --> 1:36:47.760
It's a pleasure to meet you.

1:36:48.260 --> 1:36:50.027
Did I tell you that I was an actress?

1:36:50.927 --> 1:36:54.093
Yes, I've starred in several movies.

1:36:54.259 --> 1:36:56.526
Actually, one critic

1:36:57.026 --> 1:37:01.025
even called me "dazzling".

1:37:04.425 --> 1:37:06.225
What on earth have you done to yourself?

1:37:06.491 --> 1:37:06.991
Mother?

1:37:08.058 --> 1:37:09.757
Take that stuff off your face.

1:37:10.291 --> 1:37:11.291
You think going to church

1:37:11.291 --> 1:37:12.389
looking like some teenage

1:37:12.389 --> 1:37:13.823
Jezebel is appropriate?

1:37:14.123 --> 1:37:15.223
It's just make up mother

1:37:15.223 --> 1:37:16.123
and a new hairdo.

1:37:16.257 --> 1:37:18.090
Why did you have to be such a drag?

1:37:18.090 --> 1:37:19.723
And I'm not coming to church.

1:37:20.255 --> 1:37:21.323
I feel like you're changing right

1:37:21.323 --> 1:37:21.989
in front of my eyes

1:37:21.989 --> 1:37:23.056
and I can't reach you.

1:37:23.556 --> 1:37:24.489
I keep trying but

1:37:24.489 --> 1:37:25.822
you keep pushing me away.

1:37:25.922 --> 1:37:27.955
You need to stop worrying about me.

1:37:28.388 --> 1:37:29.888
You've done your job, mother.

1:37:30.388 --> 1:37:32.088
Now it's time for me to take over.

1:37:32.154 --> 1:37:33.487
Vivian, I think it's time

1:37:33.487 --> 1:37:34.687
I put my foot down.

1:37:34.687 --> 1:37:36.487
You would have to take it off my throat

1:37:36.787 --> 1:37:37.954
first mother.

1:37:37.987 --> 1:37:39.053
You listen to me.

1:37:39.120 --> 1:37:41.053
No, you listen to me.

1:37:41.620 --> 1:37:42.786
This constant need

1:37:42.786 --> 1:37:46.619
to turn me into you is nauseating mother.

1:37:47.219 --> 1:37:49.352
I don't want to be Vivian Pierce.

1:37:49.619 --> 1:37:51.385
There's nothing wrong with her.

1:37:51.418 --> 1:37:54.218
She's so black and white.

1:37:54.518 --> 1:37:55.985
I want to see the world in color.

1:37:56.085 --> 1:37:57.418
I wan to be like those ladies

1:37:57.451 --> 1:37:58.751
who can just click their fingers

1:37:58.751 --> 1:38:00.084
and get whatever they want.

1:38:00.251 --> 1:38:01.617
Well, that is not the real world Vivian.

1:38:01.884 --> 1:38:04.183
No, that is not your world, mother.

1:38:07.216 --> 1:38:08.216
Look at you.

1:38:08.850 --> 1:38:11.282
You give up the day you got married.

1:38:11.882 --> 1:38:13.249
Vivian, your father will...

1:38:13.249 --> 1:38:13.716
What?

1:38:14.815 --> 1:38:16.548
Go ahead and call my father.

1:38:16.582 --> 1:38:17.982
I'm not scared of him.

1:38:19.948 --> 1:38:21.781
You know, you can't think

1:38:22.081 --> 1:38:24.314
without a man telling you what to do.

1:38:24.914 --> 1:38:26.847
If it's not father, it's God.

1:38:31.913 --> 1:38:33.013
Is this because of that woman?

1:38:34.978 --> 1:38:36.112
I've seen her around town,

1:38:36.112 --> 1:38:37.579
you know, your actress friend.

1:38:38.312 --> 1:38:39.679
Flashy is not attractive

1:38:39.679 --> 1:38:40.679
on a woman her age.

1:38:40.679 --> 1:38:42.378
And jealousy is not attractive

1:38:42.378 --> 1:38:43.612
and a woman of your age.

1:38:44.611 --> 1:38:45.545
Give me that dress.

1:38:46.011 --> 1:38:46.844
Give it back mother.

1:38:46.844 --> 1:38:48.644
This is not you Vivian.

1:38:48.644 --> 1:38:49.344
Give it back now.

1:38:49.344 --> 1:38:51.210
What has gotten into you?

1:38:55.843 --> 1:38:59.675
Keep your hands off of my things, Jean.

1:39:01.609 --> 1:39:02.609
Please respect that.

1:39:10.508 --> 1:39:11.641
Vivian.

1:39:13.641 --> 1:39:14.741
You don't need to be

1:39:14.741 --> 1:39:16.041
in such a rush to grow up.

1:39:19.507 --> 1:39:21.840
The world is not always kind to women.

1:39:24.106 --> 1:39:25.439
Do you think I didn't have dreams?

1:39:28.306 --> 1:39:30.005
I wanted to open my own sewing shop.

1:39:31.005 --> 1:39:33.138
Atlantic City, near the boardwalk

1:39:34.438 --> 1:39:36.904
that's where I dreamed of opening it.

1:39:39.304 --> 1:39:41.037
But life isn't a dream Vivian,

1:39:42.937 --> 1:39:43.837
do you think this lady

1:39:43.837 --> 1:39:45.137
is going to turn you into a star?

1:39:45.503 --> 1:39:46.503
She's not.

1:39:48.070 --> 1:39:50.103
That doesn't happen for girls like you.

1:39:54.136 --> 1:39:55.835
You gave up your dream

1:39:57.535 --> 1:39:59.568
because you're weak.

1:40:13.800 --> 1:40:14.933
Good morning, sweetheart.

1:40:15.966 --> 1:40:16.799
What's all this?

1:40:17.332 --> 1:40:17.866
Breakfast.

1:40:18.699 --> 1:40:20.264
You know, now we've got our own

1:40:20.264 --> 1:40:21.565
little bundle of joy on the way.

1:40:21.565 --> 1:40:22.998
I thought I ought to learn to do

1:40:22.998 --> 1:40:24.032
my part around here.

1:40:24.665 --> 1:40:26.365
Well, crazier things have happened,

1:40:26.365 --> 1:40:27.098
I suppose.

1:40:31.231 --> 1:40:31.996
I told my mother.

1:40:32.364 --> 1:40:33.496
You told your mother?

1:40:33.664 --> 1:40:34.496
I couldn't wait.

1:40:34.496 --> 1:40:35.697
It was bursting out of me.

1:40:35.730 --> 1:40:38.263
I specifically told you not to tell her.

1:40:38.763 --> 1:40:39.829
It's still early.

1:40:40.263 --> 1:40:41.129
And as you pointed out,

1:40:41.129 --> 1:40:42.496
I'm an old shrew now.

1:40:42.496 --> 1:40:45.495
So this is clearly a delicate pregnancy.

1:40:45.862 --> 1:40:47.628
Well, I never called you a shrew.

1:40:48.628 --> 1:40:49.262
Coffee?

1:40:49.861 --> 1:40:50.528
Thank you.

1:40:51.327 --> 1:40:53.994
Now, Cliff, please don't go

1:40:53.994 --> 1:40:56.027
sharing our news with anybody else,

1:40:56.294 --> 1:40:57.527
especially the boys at work.

1:40:57.994 --> 1:40:59.559
Don't think I don't know you can out

1:40:59.559 --> 1:41:00.993
gossip the ladies at the markets.

1:41:01.693 --> 1:41:03.126
I swear on all the Saints.

1:41:04.425 --> 1:41:06.826
I can't tell you how excited I am.

1:41:07.826 --> 1:41:09.059
I can't sleep anymore

1:41:09.059 --> 1:41:10.459
knowing that the day I dreamt

1:41:10.459 --> 1:41:12.692
about is so close.

1:41:12.692 --> 1:41:14.225
It's a new start.

1:41:15.291 --> 1:41:16.891
We still have time, Cliff.

1:41:17.191 --> 1:41:19.624
Let's not go wasting all of our joy.

1:41:19.991 --> 1:41:21.557
We'll have none left for the child.

1:41:25.557 --> 1:41:29.023
You um, you are

1:41:29.689 --> 1:41:32.289
excited about our baby aren't you?

1:41:32.289 --> 1:41:33.621
I can hardly wait.

1:41:33.922 --> 1:41:35.389
That's what I needed to hear.

1:41:36.589 --> 1:41:36.987
Now,

1:41:38.355 --> 1:41:39.621
do you need anything else before I go?

1:41:40.987 --> 1:41:42.621
Cliff I'm not even showing yet.

1:41:43.321 --> 1:41:44.821
I think I'm perfectly capable

1:41:44.821 --> 1:41:46.021
of looking after myself

1:41:46.021 --> 1:41:46.987
whilst you're at work.

1:41:47.487 --> 1:41:49.054
After all, I have done it

1:41:49.054 --> 1:41:50.420
for the past 16 years.

1:41:51.387 --> 1:41:52.053
OK, baby.

1:41:54.186 --> 1:41:55.318
Have a good day, Cliff.

1:41:55.886 --> 1:41:56.653
Oh, and

1:41:57.919 --> 1:41:58.486
Veronica.

1:41:59.485 --> 1:42:00.619
Yes, Cliff.

1:42:01.885 --> 1:42:03.152
You are starting to show a little.

1:42:06.118 --> 1:42:07.451
It's beautiful.

1:42:08.550 --> 1:42:09.284
What?

1:42:10.317 --> 1:42:11.017
Bye baby.

1:42:18.083 --> 1:42:19.816
The moment Cliff left the room,

1:42:19.816 --> 1:42:21.216
Veronica jumps up

1:42:21.216 --> 1:42:22.148
and heads for the phone.

1:42:24.849 --> 1:42:27.282
Operator, connect me to New York,

1:42:27.282 --> 1:42:28.682
seven, three, two, four please.

1:42:29.348 --> 1:42:29.815
Thank you.

1:42:32.648 --> 1:42:33.248
Is that you?

1:42:34.148 --> 1:42:35.880
Oh, Jimmy, we have to do this soon.

1:42:36.347 --> 1:42:38.114
His temper is out of control.

1:42:38.414 --> 1:42:39.847
My face still stings.

1:42:40.013 --> 1:42:41.580
He ain't ever going to learn is he?

1:42:42.513 --> 1:42:44.446
He's just bad, bad to the core.

1:42:44.913 --> 1:42:47.812
Oh, Jimmy, Jimmy, I am scared.

1:42:48.379 --> 1:42:50.412
I'm scared for the life of our baby.

1:42:51.279 --> 1:42:51.912
Don't worry.

1:42:53.512 --> 1:42:54.612
I'm ready when you are.

1:42:55.011 --> 1:42:55.745
Oh, Jimmy.

1:42:56.645 --> 1:42:58.978
Every time I hear your voice, it's

1:42:59.378 --> 1:43:01.044
like the rain clouds lifting.

1:43:01.844 --> 1:43:02.977
I can see clearly,

1:43:03.577 --> 1:43:06.110
I can see our future so clearly.

1:43:07.010 --> 1:43:08.076
When should we do this?

1:43:08.910 --> 1:43:10.009
Tomorrow night, Jimmy.

1:43:10.709 --> 1:43:12.409
We have to do this tomorrow night.

1:43:13.342 --> 1:43:14.309
Tell me you love me.

1:43:16.209 --> 1:43:17.808
Jimmy, I gotta go.

1:43:24.907 --> 1:43:26.807
Vivian, well, don't

1:43:26.807 --> 1:43:28.240
you look like a knockout?

1:43:28.574 --> 1:43:30.073
I knew that dress would suit you.

1:43:30.639 --> 1:43:32.073
Oh, thank you Veronica.

1:43:32.073 --> 1:43:33.406
You look beautiful, too.

1:43:33.973 --> 1:43:34.505
Why thank you.

1:43:35.139 --> 1:43:36.673
Now Vivian, what are you doing here?

1:43:36.906 --> 1:43:38.172
Not that I'm not delighted

1:43:38.172 --> 1:43:39.339
for your visit, of course.

1:43:39.572 --> 1:43:40.672
Well, since we didn't

1:43:40.672 --> 1:43:41.839
meet this week after school,

1:43:41.839 --> 1:43:44.038
I thought I'd stop by and say hello.

1:43:44.605 --> 1:43:45.805
That's what friends do, isn't it?

1:43:46.071 --> 1:43:48.171
They pop by and say hello.

1:43:48.638 --> 1:43:50.404
And we are friends, aren't we, Veronica?

1:43:50.937 --> 1:43:52.637
Of course Vivian.

1:43:53.969 --> 1:43:57.103
In fact, I'm delighted you stopped by.

1:43:57.403 --> 1:43:58.070
Really?

1:43:58.070 --> 1:43:58.736
Sure.

1:43:59.236 --> 1:44:00.903
I mean, I think it's about time

1:44:00.903 --> 1:44:02.436
we had another acting lesson.

1:44:02.536 --> 1:44:05.434
Only this time let's do it away from here

1:44:05.434 --> 1:44:06.702
or or the school.

1:44:07.002 --> 1:44:08.102
Let's make it more like

1:44:08.502 --> 1:44:10.501
two girls out on the town.

1:44:10.800 --> 1:44:11.601
Oh, Mrs. Smart.

1:44:11.635 --> 1:44:12.634
I would love that.

1:44:13.034 --> 1:44:14.867
We could go to a bar and well,

1:44:14.901 --> 1:44:16.101
I could teach you all about

1:44:16.101 --> 1:44:18.034
how to audition for a movie picture.

1:44:18.500 --> 1:44:19.434
A drink?

1:44:19.933 --> 1:44:20.733
In a bar?

1:44:21.000 --> 1:44:21.600
Sure.

1:44:21.867 --> 1:44:22.866
Oh, Mrs. Smart.

1:44:23.233 --> 1:44:24.333
I would love that.

1:44:24.333 --> 1:44:26.199
But I'm only fifteen.

1:44:26.733 --> 1:44:28.532
But in this dress, Vivian,

1:44:28.532 --> 1:44:30.932
you look like a beautiful woman.

1:44:31.332 --> 1:44:32.398
Every bar in town

1:44:32.398 --> 1:44:33.065
will want you to light

1:44:33.065 --> 1:44:35.565
up their establishment and it'll be nice.

1:44:36.065 --> 1:44:37.198
Just us girls.

1:44:38.164 --> 1:44:41.397
Just us girls?

1:44:41.397 --> 1:44:41.831
You and I?

1:44:41.831 --> 1:44:44.564
A sweet gesture, a blossoming friendship.

1:44:45.330 --> 1:44:47.830
No, Veronica was lining up

1:44:47.830 --> 1:44:49.663
alibis like a professional crook.

1:44:50.362 --> 1:44:51.963
Poor sweet Vivian

1:44:51.963 --> 1:44:53.829
was caught up in Veronica's web.

1:44:55.228 --> 1:44:55.862
Mrs. Smart.

1:44:55.895 --> 1:44:56.762
I would love that.

1:44:56.762 --> 1:44:59.228
I, I want to learn everything from you.

1:44:59.228 --> 1:45:01.495
And I will teach you everything

1:45:01.495 --> 1:45:02.561
that you want to know.

1:45:04.693 --> 1:45:07.994
I've never had any real friends before.

1:45:08.527 --> 1:45:10.027
Oh, well, except Betty, and she's well,

1:45:10.627 --> 1:45:11.559
she's just a kid.

1:45:12.793 --> 1:45:14.093
I've never really had anybody

1:45:14.093 --> 1:45:15.493
that truly understands me.

1:45:16.293 --> 1:45:17.226
Everybody just

1:45:18.459 --> 1:45:19.392
passed me by.

1:45:21.559 --> 1:45:22.657
I hope you know how much

1:45:22.657 --> 1:45:24.058
I value our relationship.

1:45:24.325 --> 1:45:26.291
Oh, as do I, Vivian.

1:45:27.157 --> 1:45:28.124
So why don't we say

1:45:28.491 --> 1:45:29.891
eight thirty tomorrow night?

1:45:30.091 --> 1:45:31.257
Perhaps you could tell your mother

1:45:31.257 --> 1:45:32.523
you're staying at a friend's place.

1:45:32.590 --> 1:45:33.957
My mother doesn't control me.

1:45:34.157 --> 1:45:35.357
I want to be like you.

1:45:35.357 --> 1:45:36.823
Strong. Confident.

1:45:37.057 --> 1:45:37.590
I'm afraid.

1:45:37.590 --> 1:45:39.990
I don't feel very strong lately.

1:45:40.123 --> 1:45:40.423
Vivian.

1:45:40.723 --> 1:45:41.489
What do you mean?

1:45:43.522 --> 1:45:45.822
My life is is complicated.

1:45:46.522 --> 1:45:47.222
Mr. Smart?

1:45:49.621 --> 1:45:51.487
You know, I used to be like you, Vivian.

1:45:51.487 --> 1:45:54.621
I dreamed of a life in the spotlight.

1:45:54.987 --> 1:45:56.554
People calling my name

1:45:56.887 --> 1:45:58.187
surrounded by glamour

1:45:58.187 --> 1:46:00.153
and most of all, friends.

1:46:00.287 --> 1:46:02.686
But the day I married Cliff,

1:46:02.686 --> 1:46:04.286
I think I let a part of that die.

1:46:04.486 --> 1:46:06.519
No, no, it's still in there.

1:46:07.386 --> 1:46:08.152
Perhaps. But

1:46:09.486 --> 1:46:10.352
I think every time

1:46:10.352 --> 1:46:11.785
Cliff strikes my face,

1:46:13.052 --> 1:46:14.318
he takes a little more of me.

1:46:16.518 --> 1:46:17.085
Veronica.

1:46:17.851 --> 1:46:18.918
You don't need a man.

1:46:19.418 --> 1:46:20.617
I mean, why do any of us

1:46:20.617 --> 1:46:21.584
need men, really?

1:46:21.916 --> 1:46:23.517
They always ruin everything.

1:46:26.250 --> 1:46:27.583
My father's idea of raising

1:46:27.583 --> 1:46:28.782
a child is shouting at it

1:46:28.883 --> 1:46:32.183
when called on by my mother.

1:46:32.648 --> 1:46:33.749
Maybe...

1:46:34.216 --> 1:46:35.749
Maybe what sweetheart?

1:46:36.349 --> 1:46:38.215
Maybe we can move to Hollywood together.

1:46:38.582 --> 1:46:39.715
Two girls ready to

1:46:39.715 --> 1:46:40.981
take on the big screen.

1:46:40.981 --> 1:46:42.880
Oh, Hollywood won't know what hit it.

1:46:43.114 --> 1:46:44.681
You could leave Cliff.

1:46:44.681 --> 1:46:46.681
We could just drive there together.

1:46:46.681 --> 1:46:48.414
Oh, Veronica, imagine.

1:46:49.714 --> 1:46:51.513
Well, that sounds wonderful, Vivian.

1:46:51.947 --> 1:46:54.213
A dream, but wonderful.

1:46:55.213 --> 1:46:56.546
It doesn't have to be.

1:46:57.246 --> 1:46:58.912
Cliff is so awful to you.

1:46:58.912 --> 1:47:00.344
Why can't he just drop dead?

1:47:00.379 --> 1:47:02.145
Oh, Vivian, you shouldn't

1:47:02.145 --> 1:47:03.245
say such a thing.

1:47:03.577 --> 1:47:05.311
Well, you'd feel positively awful

1:47:05.311 --> 1:47:06.911
if something were to happen to him now.

1:47:07.445 --> 1:47:08.710
I doubt it.

1:47:10.311 --> 1:47:10.977
Look, Vivian,

1:47:10.977 --> 1:47:13.344
I need to head into town, so.

1:47:13.377 --> 1:47:14.677
Oh, oh.

1:47:14.943 --> 1:47:16.410
Sorry, I'll go.

1:47:17.043 --> 1:47:18.943
Oh, shall we say.

1:47:19.276 --> 1:47:20.409
Eight thirty tomorrow.

1:47:20.409 --> 1:47:21.709
Outside the front of the school?

1:47:22.143 --> 1:47:23.776
Sure Veronica, I can um,

1:47:25.109 --> 1:47:26.142
I can hardly wait.

1:47:36.174 --> 1:47:37.574
Why don't you, uh

1:47:38.307 --> 1:47:40.007
come sit on my lap,

1:47:40.507 --> 1:47:42.173
let daddy take care of you.

1:47:43.273 --> 1:47:44.940
OK, baby,

1:47:45.773 --> 1:47:47.073
you like that daddy?

1:47:47.573 --> 1:47:48.639
I do indeed.

1:47:49.772 --> 1:47:50.306
So

1:47:51.739 --> 1:47:52.539
how are you

1:47:53.305 --> 1:47:54.838
going to make your old man happy?

1:47:55.737 --> 1:47:57.505
Whatever you want me to do,

1:47:57.971 --> 1:47:59.671
you're paying.

1:48:00.371 --> 1:48:01.504
Don't talk like that.

1:48:03.570 --> 1:48:06.170
Don't talk like a whore.

1:48:06.503 --> 1:48:08.436
OK baby.

1:48:11.969 --> 1:48:13.236
Jimmy.

1:48:13.736 --> 1:48:14.602
I thought I told you

1:48:14.602 --> 1:48:16.135
stay away tonight, I had company.

1:48:16.869 --> 1:48:18.768
Hi dollface, I'm the company.

1:48:18.768 --> 1:48:19.402
I'm sorry.

1:48:19.402 --> 1:48:19.968
I forgot.

1:48:20.102 --> 1:48:21.768
Are you trying to be lippy with me?

1:48:22.068 --> 1:48:23.268
Look dad, I've had a tough day.

1:48:23.268 --> 1:48:23.968
I want to go to bed.

1:48:24.334 --> 1:48:25.867
Tough day?

1:48:25.867 --> 1:48:28.267
My kid, sixteen, at high school.

1:48:28.267 --> 1:48:29.700
Thinks he's had a tough day.

1:48:30.267 --> 1:48:32.567
You don't even know what a tough day is.

1:48:33.000 --> 1:48:34.400
You try breaking your back

1:48:34.400 --> 1:48:35.400
every day at work.

1:48:35.566 --> 1:48:38.066
Then you can tell me about a tough day.

1:48:38.732 --> 1:48:40.199
Look, I should go Harvey.

1:48:40.199 --> 1:48:41.764
Sit down!

1:48:43.432 --> 1:48:45.132
You're not going anywhere tonight.

1:48:45.465 --> 1:48:48.130
I'd get out of here if I were you.

1:48:48.130 --> 1:48:49.464
He likes to use his fists

1:48:49.464 --> 1:48:50.597
to beat the women around him.

1:48:51.231 --> 1:48:52.364
Harvey, I'm out of here.

1:48:56.563 --> 1:48:57.930
Do it, go on.

1:48:58.463 --> 1:48:59.830
Let me tell you something, Jimmy Flynn.

1:49:00.896 --> 1:49:02.496
I have protected you from this for years.

1:49:02.596 --> 1:49:03.929
I will not let you talk

1:49:03.929 --> 1:49:04.762
that way about me.

1:49:07.129 --> 1:49:09.495
Your mom was a drunk.

1:49:09.928 --> 1:49:11.695
She would come home every night

1:49:11.695 --> 1:49:13.728
starting a fight throwing things,

1:49:13.728 --> 1:49:14.228
hitting me.

1:49:14.228 --> 1:49:15.094
That's a lie.

1:49:15.094 --> 1:49:16.727
She left you outside of church

1:49:16.727 --> 1:49:18.394
when you were just seven months old.

1:49:18.794 --> 1:49:19.994
She wanted to go to some bar,

1:49:19.994 --> 1:49:21.893
but you were in the way.

1:49:21.893 --> 1:49:22.960
So I came to get you again.

1:49:22.993 --> 1:49:24.226
Why are you lying?

1:49:24.260 --> 1:49:25.759
She screwed every man

1:49:25.759 --> 1:49:27.826
without a single thought of you and me.

1:49:28.626 --> 1:49:30.791
So, yeah, you may see me

1:49:30.791 --> 1:49:31.992
as the bad guy, and yeah,

1:49:33.525 --> 1:49:34.925
I ain't perfect,

1:49:35.458 --> 1:49:36.725
you know what,

1:49:37.657 --> 1:49:38.891
I'm still here.

1:49:39.758 --> 1:49:41.124
I'm still here.

1:49:41.124 --> 1:49:42.191
No, no, no.

1:49:42.424 --> 1:49:43.824
You pushed her away.

1:49:44.790 --> 1:49:47.057
Women lie Jimmy, always

1:49:47.057 --> 1:49:49.323
remember that, women lie.

1:49:51.423 --> 1:49:55.456
No dad, that's you.

1:49:56.121 --> 1:49:59.555
Life is easier without them.

1:50:00.821 --> 1:50:03.154
I got mine back when she left.

1:50:04.788 --> 1:50:06.021
And look at you, dad.

1:50:08.520 --> 1:50:09.420
You're an embarrassment.

1:50:11.187 --> 1:50:12.153
Spending all the money

1:50:12.153 --> 1:50:13.853
that you make on booze and whores.

1:50:13.886 --> 1:50:15.452
I never, ever

1:50:16.686 --> 1:50:17.886
want to turn out like you.

1:50:18.252 --> 1:50:19.452
Jimmy.

1:50:19.452 --> 1:50:20.318
I know love.

1:50:21.684 --> 1:50:22.452
I've found love,

1:50:22.452 --> 1:50:23.952
I'd kill for love and I tell you

1:50:23.952 --> 1:50:25.318
I've never felt more alive.

1:50:25.318 --> 1:50:27.651
So if you want to fade away,

1:50:28.918 --> 1:50:30.451
then that's fine.

1:50:31.550 --> 1:50:33.317
But I ain't going down with you.

1:50:33.317 --> 1:50:34.617
Do you hear me, old man?

1:50:34.817 --> 1:50:35.983
I ain't going down with you.

1:50:39.050 --> 1:50:42.049
(Train Sounds)

1:50:58.447 --> 1:50:59.214
Ha!

1:51:01.413 --> 1:51:02.680
Well, you look like

1:51:02.680 --> 1:51:03.112
you've got the weight

1:51:03.112 --> 1:51:04.213
of the world on shoulders.

1:51:04.380 --> 1:51:05.879
Now that I could handle.

1:51:05.879 --> 1:51:06.513
What's going on?

1:51:07.246 --> 1:51:08.046
Why aren't you with Jimmy?

1:51:08.213 --> 1:51:09.612
We're not joined at the hip you know.

1:51:09.612 --> 1:51:11.512
No, but you seem to share a brain.

1:51:11.512 --> 1:51:12.012
Haha,

1:51:12.012 --> 1:51:14.312
you should have been a circus clown.

1:51:14.512 --> 1:51:15.012
Riff!

1:51:15.012 --> 1:51:16.611
What happened to your face?

1:51:16.611 --> 1:51:19.244
I walked into a fist, it's New York City,

1:51:19.244 --> 1:51:20.111
what are you gonna do.

1:51:20.844 --> 1:51:21.511
Well, are you OK?

1:51:21.811 --> 1:51:23.011
Honestly, I'm fine.

1:51:27.077 --> 1:51:29.010
Vivian, can I ask you something?

1:51:29.010 --> 1:51:29.543
Sure,

1:51:30.143 --> 1:51:31.743
as long as it's not asking me on a date.

1:51:31.843 --> 1:51:33.043
Not a date, fear not.

1:51:35.276 --> 1:51:36.342
Do you trust Veronica?

1:51:36.375 --> 1:51:37.409
What do you mean trust her?

1:51:37.442 --> 1:51:38.407
You know, the thing

1:51:38.407 --> 1:51:39.808
she says the things about Cliff.

1:51:39.808 --> 1:51:41.075
He's a monster Riff.

1:51:41.075 --> 1:51:42.475
Veronica is one of the most honest

1:51:42.475 --> 1:51:44.308
and trustworthy people I've ever met.

1:51:44.508 --> 1:51:45.674
DIal it down, you sound like you

1:51:45.674 --> 1:51:46.341
run her fan club.

1:51:46.574 --> 1:51:48.074
Well, Veronica cares about us.

1:51:48.107 --> 1:51:49.940
I mean, she's more of a mother to me...

1:51:49.940 --> 1:51:50.540
Yeah, but...

1:51:50.540 --> 1:51:52.340
Yeah, but nothing Riff Randall.

1:51:52.340 --> 1:51:55.373
I mean, Veronica has taught me so much.

1:51:55.540 --> 1:51:57.039
I mean, she stopped and gave me,

1:51:57.073 --> 1:51:58.639
gave us the time of day.

1:51:59.439 --> 1:52:00.272
I mean, what other adult

1:52:00.339 --> 1:52:01.605
wants to listen to us, huh?

1:52:02.039 --> 1:52:04.105
Like really listen.

1:52:04.772 --> 1:52:06.505
Oh Vivian, I'm wrestling

1:52:06.505 --> 1:52:07.671
with something real bad.

1:52:08.105 --> 1:52:10.871
What are you talking about, Riff?

1:52:10.871 --> 1:52:11.804
Can I trust you

1:52:12.804 --> 1:52:14.337
that no matter what I say,

1:52:14.337 --> 1:52:15.469
it stays between us.

1:52:15.704 --> 1:52:17.337
This is serious, Vivian,

1:52:17.337 --> 1:52:19.170
and it isn't some silly, childish thing.

1:52:19.270 --> 1:52:20.603
I don't know if you've noticed but

1:52:20.603 --> 1:52:22.436
I've done a lot of growing up recently.

1:52:22.702 --> 1:52:24.002
So I swear to you,

1:52:24.335 --> 1:52:25.436
I'll take it to the grave.

1:52:27.235 --> 1:52:29.335
Veronica has asked Jimmy to kill Cliff.

1:52:32.268 --> 1:52:33.268
What?

1:52:33.268 --> 1:52:35.201
Jimmy's asked me to be involved as well.

1:52:35.201 --> 1:52:36.434
And it's a thousand bucks,

1:52:36.434 --> 1:52:37.734
which is more money than I ever

1:52:37.734 --> 1:52:38.234
thought I'd see.

1:52:38.234 --> 1:52:39.100
But I can't, can I?

1:52:40.000 --> 1:52:40.967
Woah Riff.

1:52:40.967 --> 1:52:41.967
Slow down.

1:52:42.100 --> 1:52:43.233
I know he beats her.

1:52:43.233 --> 1:52:44.532
At least that's what she says, but

1:52:44.933 --> 1:52:46.833
murder is just so final, you know,

1:52:46.866 --> 1:52:48.166
I mean, how could I live with that?

1:52:49.532 --> 1:52:51.132
When is this supposed to happen?

1:52:51.599 --> 1:52:53.732
Tomorrow night, he's gone girl crazy.

1:52:53.865 --> 1:52:54.832
It's like he thinks that

1:52:54.832 --> 1:52:56.598
if he kills Cliff, Veronica

1:52:56.598 --> 1:52:57.898
will fall madly in love with him.

1:52:57.898 --> 1:53:00.398
The whole thing is just hairbrained.

1:53:00.764 --> 1:53:02.931
Jeez, killing her husband

1:53:02.931 --> 1:53:05.130
to prove his love for her.

1:53:05.130 --> 1:53:06.397
Ain't that something.

1:53:06.397 --> 1:53:08.696
Should I call the police?

1:53:08.696 --> 1:53:10.563
Should I try to stop him? No, no, no.

1:53:10.596 --> 1:53:11.929
He'll go to prison Riff.

1:53:11.929 --> 1:53:13.596
You need to be there and stop him

1:53:13.596 --> 1:53:15.196
from making a stupid mistake.

1:53:15.396 --> 1:53:16.495
He won't listen to me.

1:53:16.529 --> 1:53:17.795
I've already tried.

1:53:17.929 --> 1:53:18.962
Well, if he doesn't,

1:53:18.995 --> 1:53:20.327
then go to the police.

1:53:20.562 --> 1:53:21.761
Just, just stop it.

1:53:22.195 --> 1:53:24.361
This could ruin his life and Veronicas is

1:53:24.394 --> 1:53:25.327
if they get caught.

1:53:25.861 --> 1:53:28.261
We can't allow that to happen Riff.

1:53:28.261 --> 1:53:30.027
Vivian, you better

1:53:30.027 --> 1:53:31.660
not be down by the tracks.

1:53:32.327 --> 1:53:35.925
She is driving me crazy.

1:53:37.093 --> 1:53:38.992
God, killing Cliff.

1:53:38.992 --> 1:53:41.159
Riff, you need to stop it.

1:53:41.192 --> 1:53:44.125
We can't allow Veronica to get hurt.

1:53:44.325 --> 1:53:45.825
She could get sent away

1:53:45.825 --> 1:53:46.691
if she gets caught,

1:53:46.691 --> 1:53:48.258
and that's not the way for her

1:53:48.258 --> 1:53:49.324
to get away from Cliff.

1:53:49.458 --> 1:53:51.624
Veronica, you worried about Veronica?

1:53:52.457 --> 1:53:53.057
I've got to go.

1:53:53.057 --> 1:53:53.624
I'm sorry.

1:53:53.690 --> 1:53:55.590
Vivian, but that's not the whole story.

1:53:55.889 --> 1:53:58.490
I still have more need to say, Vivian!

1:54:01.223 --> 1:54:04.222
(Train Sounds)

1:54:10.522 --> 1:54:12.355
It's 7:30 a.m. on the big day, Cliff.

1:54:12.355 --> 1:54:12.987
Well, Cliff

1:54:14.388 --> 1:54:15.388
wakes up to a life

1:54:15.388 --> 1:54:16.454
he could only dream of.

1:54:17.321 --> 1:54:18.554
Cliff stands and stares

1:54:18.554 --> 1:54:20.020
at Veronica for a few moments

1:54:20.587 --> 1:54:21.787
as she prepares breakfast.

1:54:23.520 --> 1:54:24.886
I want to remember this moment.

1:54:25.053 --> 1:54:26.786
Oh, Cliff, you startled me.

1:54:27.919 --> 1:54:29.386
I feel like I'm looking at a new you.

1:54:30.585 --> 1:54:31.318
What's the occasion?

1:54:31.885 --> 1:54:33.318
It's just breakfast.

1:54:34.452 --> 1:54:35.085
I'm already late.

1:54:36.585 --> 1:54:37.485
I've got a big day,

1:54:39.318 --> 1:54:40.550
but I can take it to go.

1:54:41.651 --> 1:54:42.984
You're always on the move.

1:54:47.916 --> 1:54:48.416
Oh, and

1:54:50.383 --> 1:54:50.883
Veronica.

1:54:53.982 --> 1:54:55.482
I always loved you.

1:54:56.582 --> 1:54:58.148
Whatever happened,

1:54:59.715 --> 1:55:00.615
I wanted you to know that.

1:55:01.781 --> 1:55:02.715
UInexpectedly, tears

1:55:02.715 --> 1:55:04.414
form in Veronica's eyes.

1:55:05.148 --> 1:55:06.781
These ain't no acting tears.

1:55:07.614 --> 1:55:10.147
Veronica appears moved,

1:55:10.847 --> 1:55:12.280
moved by Cliffs words.

1:55:13.180 --> 1:55:15.612
The man she's about to have killed.

1:55:17.179 --> 1:55:17.978
Veronica.

1:55:18.079 --> 1:55:20.679
Jimmy, Jimmy you startled me.

1:55:24.577 --> 1:55:25.912
You having second thoughts?

1:55:26.112 --> 1:55:27.011
What?

1:55:27.545 --> 1:55:30.878
No, no Jimmy, it's

1:55:30.878 --> 1:55:32.477
me and you from now on.

1:55:32.477 --> 1:55:33.977
Our future begins tonight.

1:55:35.277 --> 1:55:36.577
When can we leave for Hollywood?

1:55:37.010 --> 1:55:38.743
A week, maybe two.

1:55:39.543 --> 1:55:40.143
I just don't want it

1:55:40.143 --> 1:55:41.210
to look as though I'm

1:55:41.210 --> 1:55:41.843
fleeing.

1:55:43.675 --> 1:55:46.242
God, I love you Veronica Smart.

1:55:59.040 --> 1:56:01.474
So you get here at eight o'clock.

1:56:02.139 --> 1:56:03.040
Cliff would have just

1:56:03.040 --> 1:56:03.807
come home from work,

1:56:03.807 --> 1:56:04.940
you'll catch him off guard.

1:56:05.373 --> 1:56:07.106
I have an alibi in place.

1:56:08.239 --> 1:56:12.505
There is nothing that can stand in our way

1:56:19.404 --> 1:56:20.338
Jimmy.

1:56:20.338 --> 1:56:23.271
Hey, Sal Salazar's fighting tonight.

1:56:23.871 --> 1:56:26.037
Why don't you and I have a night in.

1:56:26.637 --> 1:56:29.370
Watch the fight, have a couple of beers.

1:56:30.236 --> 1:56:30.936
I can't dad,

1:56:30.936 --> 1:56:31.969
I've got something I need to do.

1:56:33.103 --> 1:56:34.436
I'm trying here Jimmy.

1:56:36.335 --> 1:56:39.102
You have no idea how it feels to be

1:56:39.102 --> 1:56:41.302
invisible, do you, mother?

1:56:44.201 --> 1:56:44.901
You know, I sit

1:56:46.001 --> 1:56:47.034
and watch the movies

1:56:47.034 --> 1:56:50.500
and see these beautiful women,

1:56:51.700 --> 1:56:52.700
so full of life,

1:56:52.700 --> 1:56:54.700
their eyes sparkle like diamonds,

1:56:57.032 --> 1:56:59.366
and they seem happy.

1:57:01.665 --> 1:57:03.764
Really happy,

1:57:06.032 --> 1:57:07.465
and then

1:57:07.865 --> 1:57:09.364
I look in the mirror and I see,

1:57:13.064 --> 1:57:13.431
me.

1:57:15.864 --> 1:57:16.496
Dad.

1:57:18.563 --> 1:57:19.963
That woman you said you loved,

1:57:24.196 --> 1:57:24.662
Patricia?

1:57:27.662 --> 1:57:28.895
What about her?

1:57:28.895 --> 1:57:30.862
Why didn't you fight for her?

1:57:32.695 --> 1:57:33.895
How do you know I didn't?

1:57:34.161 --> 1:57:36.061
Well, did you?

1:57:37.161 --> 1:57:38.627
How could I Jimmy.

1:57:39.027 --> 1:57:40.427
She made a choice

1:57:41.027 --> 1:57:41.860
as soon as she let

1:57:41.860 --> 1:57:43.360
that other guy into her bed,

1:57:45.360 --> 1:57:46.460
it was all over.

1:57:47.793 --> 1:57:48.559
Those women on the screen

1:57:48.559 --> 1:57:50.259
aren't like that in real life.

1:57:50.259 --> 1:57:52.425
They have the best makeup

1:57:52.425 --> 1:57:53.592
people and the best gowns.

1:57:53.692 --> 1:57:54.825
And I want that.

1:57:55.992 --> 1:57:57.025
I hate my life.

1:57:57.091 --> 1:57:58.625
I just want to be beautiful,

1:57:58.625 --> 1:58:00.258
why is that so wrong?

1:58:00.258 --> 1:58:01.523
Oh, Vivian you are beautiful.

1:58:01.523 --> 1:58:02.991
Stop it, mother.

1:58:05.690 --> 1:58:08.323
Veronica is making me beautiful.

1:58:09.990 --> 1:58:10.690
Look at me.

1:58:12.623 --> 1:58:13.156
Maybe.

1:58:16.089 --> 1:58:17.121
Maybe she made a mistake,

1:58:18.955 --> 1:58:20.755
got married for the wrong reasons,

1:58:20.755 --> 1:58:21.888
maybe she was waiting for you

1:58:21.888 --> 1:58:22.788
to come and save her.

1:58:24.987 --> 1:58:25.388
Jimmy?

1:58:26.554 --> 1:58:27.621
What is this all about?

1:58:28.087 --> 1:58:29.054
You listen to me.

1:58:31.387 --> 1:58:33.187
You are 15 years old.

1:58:34.920 --> 1:58:35.719
You haven't even fully

1:58:35.719 --> 1:58:37.153
blossomed as a woman yet.

1:58:38.818 --> 1:58:39.686
But I see you,

1:58:41.286 --> 1:58:42.419
I see you are beautiful

1:58:43.318 --> 1:58:44.585
and you don't need to hide behind

1:58:44.585 --> 1:58:45.785
this paint to show that.

1:58:47.318 --> 1:58:49.285
Nothing that I got to go, Jimmy.

1:58:51.818 --> 1:58:52.884
Should I be worried about you?

1:58:54.384 --> 1:58:54.850
What do you mean?

1:58:55.916 --> 1:58:56.317
Well,

1:58:57.483 --> 1:59:01.416
this woman, are you serious about her?

1:59:01.416 --> 1:59:02.583
I've never been more serious

1:59:02.583 --> 1:59:03.683
about anything in my life.

1:59:04.716 --> 1:59:05.982
You have to find your own way,

1:59:05.982 --> 1:59:07.582
you can't just become somebody else.

1:59:07.615 --> 1:59:08.382
That's not true.

1:59:09.682 --> 1:59:11.514
Veronica said that many movie

1:59:11.514 --> 1:59:12.915
stars come from lives like mine.

1:59:12.915 --> 1:59:14.614
They get to change their name and

1:59:14.614 --> 1:59:15.814
they're weight and their hair.

1:59:15.814 --> 1:59:17.847
You know how many girls feel like you?

1:59:19.147 --> 1:59:20.514
All wanting the same thing.

1:59:21.180 --> 1:59:22.213
So should I be worried?

1:59:23.280 --> 1:59:23.713
Worried.

1:59:26.213 --> 1:59:27.279
About love?

1:59:29.213 --> 1:59:32.245
No dad you don't need to be worried.

1:59:34.478 --> 1:59:35.612
I know that she's the one.

1:59:36.645 --> 1:59:37.210
Veronica...

1:59:37.210 --> 1:59:38.911
Ahh, Veronica!

1:59:39.544 --> 1:59:41.077
I don't want to be your enemy

1:59:41.378 --> 1:59:42.877
and I want you to succeed.

1:59:44.077 --> 1:59:45.144
But we have few options

1:59:45.144 --> 1:59:46.309
in life as women, Vivian,

1:59:46.910 --> 1:59:47.943
so we have to work harder,

1:59:47.943 --> 1:59:48.877
and that's all I want

1:59:48.877 --> 1:59:50.309
you to do is work harder.

1:59:51.776 --> 1:59:53.943
You know, that is the first time

1:59:53.943 --> 1:59:56.009
you have told me her name.

1:59:56.009 --> 1:59:56.342
Yeah.

1:59:58.075 --> 1:59:59.808
Veronica, Veronica.

2:00:01.808 --> 2:00:03.241
I don't think I know her.

2:00:03.241 --> 2:00:06.441
Well, apart from your teacher.

2:00:13.007 --> 2:00:15.906
Well, I am working harder mother,

2:00:17.673 --> 2:00:18.406
but this time

2:00:19.506 --> 2:00:20.172
it's for me.

2:00:21.372 --> 2:00:21.972
Not you.

2:00:22.672 --> 2:00:24.172
Oh, Vivian.

2:00:24.172 --> 2:00:24.905
Mother I have to go.

2:00:25.605 --> 2:00:27.471
Please tell me you're not involved

2:00:27.471 --> 2:00:28.571
with your teacher.

2:00:28.871 --> 2:00:29.871
I have to go and find Riff,

2:00:29.871 --> 2:00:30.971
and if I can't find him

2:00:30.971 --> 2:00:31.804
I have to find Veronica and stop...

2:00:31.804 --> 2:00:32.304
Stop what?

2:00:32.337 --> 2:00:33.904
What are you talking about?

2:00:33.971 --> 2:00:36.337
I got to go, I won't be late.

2:00:36.504 --> 2:00:36.770
Jimmy please.

2:00:36.770 --> 2:00:37.803
Jimmy stop.

2:00:37.803 --> 2:00:39.037
Jimmy!

2:00:50.335 --> 2:00:52.168
Riff, Riff?

2:00:52.168 --> 2:00:53.435
Is that you?

2:00:56.301 --> 2:00:57.501
So have you got the gun?

2:00:57.534 --> 2:00:59.034
I'm sorry Jimmy I ain't got it.

2:00:59.334 --> 2:01:00.234
The guy never gave it me back.

2:01:00.234 --> 2:01:01.134
And he's vanished.

2:01:01.267 --> 2:01:02.767
Damn it Riff. I need that.

2:01:02.867 --> 2:01:04.633
You don't have to go through with this.

2:01:05.600 --> 2:01:06.400
You really don't have it?

2:01:06.766 --> 2:01:07.233
Sorry.

2:01:07.533 --> 2:01:09.633
Oh, well, that's perfect Riff.

2:01:11.732 --> 2:01:13.232
To hell with it, I still got my bat.

2:01:13.465 --> 2:01:14.732
Don't do this.

2:01:14.732 --> 2:01:15.932
You'll ruin your life.

2:01:16.198 --> 2:01:17.065
If I don't do something,

2:01:17.065 --> 2:01:18.431
and he hurts my baby

2:01:19.131 --> 2:01:20.631
how am I supposed to live with that?

2:01:20.898 --> 2:01:21.998
You think your some kind of mobster

2:01:21.998 --> 2:01:23.131
now cause you are gonna kill a guy?

2:01:23.131 --> 2:01:24.164
Oh Riff, go home

2:01:24.164 --> 2:01:24.897
if you don't want to help,

2:01:24.897 --> 2:01:25.897
you ain't got to be here.

2:01:26.197 --> 2:01:27.030
Jimmy.

2:01:27.397 --> 2:01:28.197
Jimmy, look at me.

2:01:28.697 --> 2:01:29.730
all the things you could

2:01:29.730 --> 2:01:30.363
do with your life.

2:01:30.363 --> 2:01:32.763
I don't need anything else

2:01:32.763 --> 2:01:34.263
just her and my kid.

2:01:34.263 --> 2:01:34.696
You're a kid yourself.

2:01:34.696 --> 2:01:36.062
Jimmy, how are you going to raise a kid?

2:01:36.329 --> 2:01:37.096
Riff, go home,

2:01:38.295 --> 2:01:38.995
please.

2:01:39.329 --> 2:01:40.962
Once you're marked by the devil Jimmy,

2:01:40.962 --> 2:01:42.028
you can't come back from that.

2:01:42.295 --> 2:01:43.595
Believe me, I know.

2:01:43.595 --> 2:01:44.628
Some things are worth it.

2:01:45.061 --> 2:01:46.328
I'll call the police, Jimmy.

2:01:46.328 --> 2:01:47.727
No, you won't Riff, that ain't you.

2:01:47.761 --> 2:01:49.327
Jimmy, please just listen to me.

2:01:49.327 --> 2:01:50.960
I really needed that gun.

2:01:50.960 --> 2:01:51.860
Call it off.

2:01:51.860 --> 2:01:52.327
No way.

2:01:56.760 --> 2:01:57.426
It just means that

2:01:57.426 --> 2:01:58.959
I have to do this myself.

2:02:00.459 --> 2:02:01.592
Like a man.

2:02:01.592 --> 2:02:02.359
Jimmy please.

2:02:02.359 --> 2:02:03.559
It's going to be fine Riff.

2:02:04.858 --> 2:02:05.425
Trust me.

2:02:06.758 --> 2:02:08.491
In a few hours,

2:02:09.858 --> 2:02:10.758
all this is over.

2:02:14.191 --> 2:02:15.724
Dammit Jimmy.

2:02:17.124 --> 2:02:18.457
I'm sorry.

2:02:20.723 --> 2:02:21.590
A plan.

2:02:21.590 --> 2:02:24.023
A man ain't a man without a plan.

2:02:24.922 --> 2:02:26.089
It's February 13th,

2:02:26.689 --> 2:02:28.922
just after 7.30 that same evening,

2:02:29.922 --> 2:02:32.188
silence washes over the neighborhood.

2:02:32.188 --> 2:02:35.188
A figure seen at the back of the house

2:02:35.321 --> 2:02:36.554
heads towards the back door.

2:02:37.487 --> 2:02:38.621
The figure stands in front

2:02:38.621 --> 2:02:39.454
of it for a moment

2:02:40.054 --> 2:02:41.454
and then knocks on the door.

2:02:42.553 --> 2:02:44.353
As the door opens, however.

2:02:45.153 --> 2:02:48.086
Well, it's not Cliff, It's Veronica,

2:02:49.053 --> 2:02:50.319
and it's not Jimmy stood

2:02:50.319 --> 2:02:53.752
there, it's Riff.

2:02:54.952 --> 2:02:55.718
Riff, what are you doing here?

2:02:56.352 --> 2:02:57.085
You're early.

2:02:57.118 --> 2:02:58.285
I have to leave first,

2:02:58.285 --> 2:03:00.784
and then you come back when Cliff's home.

2:03:00.784 --> 2:03:01.284
Jesus, I thought

2:03:01.318 --> 2:03:02.851
Jimmy went through the plan with you.

2:03:03.717 --> 2:03:04.117
Mrs Smart.

2:03:04.517 --> 2:03:06.217
Where is Jimmy is he not with you.

2:03:07.717 --> 2:03:08.717
Is that the gun?

2:03:09.583 --> 2:03:10.750
I thought you gave that to Jimmy.

2:03:11.583 --> 2:03:12.649
In fact, I thought you said

2:03:12.649 --> 2:03:13.883
you didn't want any part of this.

2:03:13.883 --> 2:03:15.082
Mrs Smart.

2:03:15.082 --> 2:03:16.249
Now run along Riff,

2:03:16.249 --> 2:03:17.349
I need to get out of here,

2:03:17.349 --> 2:03:18.715
go and meet Vivian.

2:03:20.548 --> 2:03:21.282
Riff?

2:03:22.715 --> 2:03:24.381
Riff, what are you doing?

2:03:24.781 --> 2:03:25.214
Aaahh!

2:03:25.914 --> 2:03:26.948
Yes, Riff.

2:03:27.181 --> 2:03:28.614
What are you doing?

2:03:29.014 --> 2:03:30.380
Let's go back to the moment

2:03:30.414 --> 2:03:32.713
Riff and Cliff came face to face.

2:03:32.713 --> 2:03:34.947
It was like a showdown in the Wild West,

2:03:34.947 --> 2:03:36.980
but who would flinch first?

2:03:38.346 --> 2:03:40.612
We still have unfinished business kid.

2:03:41.079 --> 2:03:41.912
Mr. Smart.

2:03:52.911 --> 2:03:54.444
Did you really think

2:03:54.444 --> 2:03:55.044
I was going to let

2:03:55.044 --> 2:03:56.177
you get away with that kid?

2:03:56.177 --> 2:03:57.777
Please Mr Smart, I'm sorry.

2:03:57.777 --> 2:03:58.810
You think you can jump

2:03:58.810 --> 2:03:59.677
me, you little punk?

2:03:59.843 --> 2:04:00.843
It was a mistake, please.

2:04:00.876 --> 2:04:04.343
I didn't know you were Veronicas husband.

2:04:04.343 --> 2:04:05.409
You made a joke out of me

2:04:05.409 --> 2:04:06.242
for the last time.

2:04:06.709 --> 2:04:08.909
You're nothing, street trash.

2:04:09.209 --> 2:04:10.508
I should do the world a favour

2:04:10.508 --> 2:04:11.742
and put you out of your misery.

2:04:11.875 --> 2:04:13.175
Please don't do this.

2:04:13.175 --> 2:04:15.274
I'm a good kid, I didn't mean to hurt you.

2:04:15.574 --> 2:04:16.841
You ain't a good kid Riff.

2:04:16.841 --> 2:04:18.174
Please, please, please.

2:04:18.174 --> 2:04:19.741
Oh God, oh God, oh God!

2:04:19.741 --> 2:04:20.974
So tell me Riff,

2:04:20.974 --> 2:04:22.840
are you sleeping with my wife?

2:04:23.740 --> 2:04:24.573
No, no.

2:04:24.607 --> 2:04:25.640
Why would you think that?

2:04:26.740 --> 2:04:28.206
I think you are.

2:04:28.206 --> 2:04:30.339
Now, Is it just you

2:04:30.672 --> 2:04:31.772
or is it Jimmy as well?

2:04:31.806 --> 2:04:33.005
You got it all wrong.

2:04:34.805 --> 2:04:36.238
Ahhh, it's Jimmy.

2:04:37.505 --> 2:04:38.471
Jimmy's stepping out with your wife,

2:04:38.471 --> 2:04:39.638
not me, I swear.

2:04:39.971 --> 2:04:41.638
Give me a Bible and i'll swear on it.

2:04:43.804 --> 2:04:44.904
Jimmy, that son of a bitch!

2:04:45.304 --> 2:04:47.704
Please just let me go.

2:04:47.704 --> 2:04:48.670
I ain't going to cause you

2:04:48.670 --> 2:04:49.437
any more problems.

2:04:49.437 --> 2:04:51.236
You give me one damn reason I should.

2:04:51.403 --> 2:04:53.536
Because I'm just 16.

2:04:53.536 --> 2:04:55.402
I ain't moved.

2:04:57.536 --> 2:04:59.735
Your wife has hired Jimmy to murder you.

2:05:01.368 --> 2:05:02.868
You're lying.

2:05:02.868 --> 2:05:04.235
No, I ain't, he is supposed

2:05:04.235 --> 2:05:05.135
to do it this week?

2:05:05.501 --> 2:05:07.401
She wants your money and Jimmy,

2:05:07.401 --> 2:05:07.901
I swear to you,

2:05:08.101 --> 2:05:09.134
I ain't stupid enough to be lying

2:05:09.134 --> 2:05:10.300
to you right now.

2:05:10.300 --> 2:05:11.900
No, no, she's having my baby.

2:05:12.400 --> 2:05:14.700
She said the same thing to Jimmy.

2:05:21.332 --> 2:05:24.865
Veronica, you've made a joke out of me

2:05:24.865 --> 2:05:26.265
for the last time.

2:05:26.265 --> 2:05:29.431
Oh God, what have I done?

2:05:29.431 --> 2:05:31.964
You just saved your own life kid.

2:05:31.964 --> 2:05:32.498
Now

2:05:33.497 --> 2:05:34.564
you're working for me.

2:05:35.264 --> 2:05:36.030
Do you understand?

2:05:37.230 --> 2:05:39.863
Everything I tell you to do you do it

2:05:40.297 --> 2:05:42.963
or I will kill you kid, you and Jimmy.

2:05:43.696 --> 2:05:44.729
Do you understand me?

2:05:44.763 --> 2:05:45.396
Yeah, I.

2:05:46.196 --> 2:05:47.196
Yes, sir.

2:05:51.795 --> 2:05:55.594
So, she wants to be dead.

2:05:58.861 --> 2:06:01.327
Aaah. Riff!

2:06:01.327 --> 2:06:04.327
Riff, look at me, we're friends,

2:06:04.360 --> 2:06:05.460
why would you do this?

2:06:06.093 --> 2:06:08.193
Cliff knows Mrs Smart,

2:06:08.193 --> 2:06:09.793
he knows all about your plan.

2:06:10.093 --> 2:06:11.692
How, how does he know?

2:06:12.259 --> 2:06:12.692
I had to tell him

2:06:12.726 --> 2:06:13.625
he was going to kill me.

2:06:14.025 --> 2:06:14.992
Why, oh God.

2:06:14.992 --> 2:06:15.825
What have you done.

2:06:16.925 --> 2:06:18.425
I've got to do this Mrs Smart.

2:06:18.425 --> 2:06:20.591
No, no, Riff, don't you see?

2:06:20.891 --> 2:06:22.624
He's trying to set you up for my murder.

2:06:22.891 --> 2:06:24.357
He is going to kill me.

2:06:24.791 --> 2:06:25.990
Do you hear me, he's

2:06:25.990 --> 2:06:27.424
going to put a bullet in my head

2:06:27.524 --> 2:06:30.323
and not just mine, Jimmys as well.

2:06:30.323 --> 2:06:32.823
This way, this way, he said,

2:06:32.823 --> 2:06:33.856
he is going to leave us alone.

2:06:34.956 --> 2:06:37.756
There's got to be a way out of this Riff.

2:06:37.756 --> 2:06:40.189
I'm so sorry.

2:06:40.189 --> 2:06:42.088
I guess this was my path.

2:06:42.088 --> 2:06:43.421
You could flee.

2:06:43.421 --> 2:06:45.554
You could just pretend

2:06:45.554 --> 2:06:46.388
that you killed me.

2:06:46.721 --> 2:06:47.754
What about Jimmy?

2:06:48.087 --> 2:06:48.987
What about him?

2:06:49.454 --> 2:06:49.854
He loves you.

2:06:49.854 --> 2:06:51.087
You would just leave him?

2:06:53.387 --> 2:06:54.420
He's a sweet kid.

2:06:55.120 --> 2:06:55.753
He's young.

2:06:55.753 --> 2:06:57.586
I don't want him on the run,

2:06:57.586 --> 2:06:58.453
he's got the rest of

2:06:58.453 --> 2:06:59.486
his life ahead of him.

2:07:00.686 --> 2:07:04.785
Oh God, Mr Smart was right.

2:07:04.785 --> 2:07:06.452
He said that you didn't love Jimmy

2:07:06.818 --> 2:07:07.385
because you couldn't

2:07:07.385 --> 2:07:08.551
love anybody but yourself.

2:07:08.885 --> 2:07:09.818
And you needed us to play

2:07:09.818 --> 2:07:11.018
a part in your husband's murder?

2:07:11.251 --> 2:07:12.318
Riff, no!

2:07:13.117 --> 2:07:14.817
I wish he'd never met you.

2:07:15.151 --> 2:07:16.417
I wish none of us had.

2:07:16.884 --> 2:07:18.650
You ruined everything.

2:07:18.950 --> 2:07:19.850
Don't you see that he's

2:07:19.850 --> 2:07:21.550
poisoning your mind against me?

2:07:21.816 --> 2:07:22.183
You know,

2:07:23.516 --> 2:07:25.116
the moment my parents died, I knew,

2:07:26.016 --> 2:07:28.115
I knew that my life would mean nothing,

2:07:28.115 --> 2:07:29.749
that I would mean nothing.

2:07:32.382 --> 2:07:33.448
Something like this was

2:07:33.448 --> 2:07:34.348
inevitable, I guess.

2:07:34.915 --> 2:07:36.548
No Riff, no!

2:07:36.548 --> 2:07:38.447
Goodbye Mrs Smart,

2:07:38.447 --> 2:07:40.614
and may God forgive me.

2:07:41.580 --> 2:07:42.280
Nooooo! Oh,

2:08:07.877 --> 2:08:08.943
(Riff Sobbing)

2:08:18.275 --> 2:08:18.842
It's OK.

2:08:22.308 --> 2:08:23.142
It's OK.

2:08:25.108 --> 2:08:27.508
The hard part's done.

2:08:30.974 --> 2:08:34.607
Cliff, help.

2:08:35.307 --> 2:08:37.806
Help me.

2:08:38.839 --> 2:08:40.872
And why would I do that, sweetheart?

2:08:43.405 --> 2:08:46.205
After you tried to have me killed.

2:08:48.805 --> 2:08:50.471
I'm sorry.

2:08:51.904 --> 2:08:55.071
Oh, I know just how sorry you are.

2:08:56.537 --> 2:09:01.503
My God, all I ever asked from you

2:09:01.670 --> 2:09:03.703
was for you to love me,

2:09:04.469 --> 2:09:05.869
and to give me a child,

2:09:06.036 --> 2:09:08.036
you couldn't even achieve that.

2:09:12.435 --> 2:09:18.867
Have you ever, really loved me Veronica?

2:09:21.767 --> 2:09:24.233
I love you.

2:09:24.467 --> 2:09:27.400
No, no, no, you don't.

2:09:28.766 --> 2:09:30.566
Those are just the desperate words

2:09:30.666 --> 2:09:31.899
of a dying woman.

2:09:36.332 --> 2:09:40.165
I never loved Jimmy.

2:09:41.198 --> 2:09:42.731
I love you.

2:09:44.864 --> 2:09:49.563
No, because you lie as often

2:09:49.563 --> 2:09:51.030
as you breathe baby.

2:10:02.728 --> 2:10:05.061
You get out, you get out of town.

2:10:05.061 --> 2:10:06.428
I don't ever want to see you

2:10:06.428 --> 2:10:07.261
around here again.

2:10:09.894 --> 2:10:12.560
Oh, and Riff.

2:10:12.560 --> 2:10:14.960
Leave the gun here,

2:10:15.960 --> 2:10:18.959
I'll get rid of it,

2:10:20.126 --> 2:10:21.759
I ain't leaving anything to chance.

2:10:25.159 --> 2:10:27.225
Now, get out of here!

2:10:38.857 --> 2:10:39.623
Police.

2:10:44.456 --> 2:10:47.389
Oh God, please.

2:10:48.322 --> 2:10:50.322
There was just some crazy kid here.

2:10:51.688 --> 2:10:53.188
He shot my wife,

2:10:53.188 --> 2:10:55.088
and then he shot me as well.

2:10:55.888 --> 2:10:56.921
Please!

2:11:20.585 --> 2:11:21.184
Oh, God.

2:11:22.684 --> 2:11:24.084
Oh, God, Veronica.

2:11:26.684 --> 2:11:28.384
Who did this to you was it him?

2:11:28.384 --> 2:11:29.417
JImmy?

2:11:29.417 --> 2:11:31.683
Is that you?

2:11:31.683 --> 2:11:32.716
Go....

2:11:32.716 --> 2:11:34.983
I ain't going anywhere.

2:11:34.983 --> 2:11:37.482
I won't let anybody hurt you?

2:11:37.482 --> 2:11:40.349
Take care of you, hold on Veronica.

2:11:40.715 --> 2:11:43.682
No, no, wake up Veronica, wake up?

2:11:45.248 --> 2:11:47.048
You can't.

2:11:47.581 --> 2:11:48.614
You can't die.

2:11:48.614 --> 2:11:50.047
You can't leave me.

2:11:58.413 --> 2:12:00.113
Oh God!

2:12:12.544 --> 2:12:13.378
You see, Jimmy.

2:12:16.177 --> 2:12:17.244
I always win.

2:12:19.710 --> 2:12:23.276
I always have and I always will.

2:12:25.609 --> 2:12:26.209
You killed her.

2:12:27.642 --> 2:12:30.409
You son of a bitch, you killed her!

2:12:30.875 --> 2:12:32.808
No you killed her Jimmy.

2:12:38.474 --> 2:12:40.074
If you want to be a man

2:12:43.040 --> 2:12:43.873
you've got to be able

2:12:43.873 --> 2:12:47.540
to take a shot and not miss,

2:12:50.506 --> 2:12:54.172
and you missed Jimmy,

2:12:55.039 --> 2:12:57.938
it's never wise to miss.

2:12:58.572 --> 2:13:00.371
Give my love to Veronica.

2:13:01.005 --> 2:13:01.738
Wait!

2:13:24.668 --> 2:13:25.635
Oh God!

2:13:32.300 --> 2:13:34.567
Oh my God.

2:13:34.933 --> 2:13:36.833
I thought I told you to go.

2:13:37.500 --> 2:13:39.033
No, no!

2:13:39.266 --> 2:13:40.699
You know what your problem is Riff?

2:13:40.699 --> 2:13:41.832
You care too much.

2:13:42.766 --> 2:13:44.332
Why would you do that?

2:13:44.332 --> 2:13:45.132
You promised.

2:13:46.898 --> 2:13:50.365
Nobody outwits Cliff Smart.

2:13:50.865 --> 2:13:53.764
Now, I um, I tell the police

2:13:53.764 --> 2:13:56.131
that you and Jimmy just just burst in

2:13:56.697 --> 2:13:57.897
and he was screaming

2:13:57.897 --> 2:13:59.930
at her to leave with him, but no,

2:13:59.930 --> 2:14:01.563
she wanted to stay with me

2:14:02.196 --> 2:14:03.696
because she still loves me.

2:14:04.729 --> 2:14:07.829
But he wouldn't have any of that,

2:14:07.829 --> 2:14:08.762
so he shot her,

2:14:09.795 --> 2:14:11.229
but then I shot him,

2:14:11.229 --> 2:14:12.762
in self defence of course.

2:14:13.595 --> 2:14:15.095
Jimmy, Jimmy come on.

2:14:15.695 --> 2:14:19.627
It's too late for him, but you can run.

2:14:20.894 --> 2:14:21.960
I'm letting you run.

2:14:22.260 --> 2:14:23.327
You murdered him.

2:14:23.794 --> 2:14:26.826
He would do anything for her, anything.

2:14:27.793 --> 2:14:28.760
I'm telling the police.

2:14:28.926 --> 2:14:30.059
You're trying to set him up.

2:14:30.926 --> 2:14:32.126
And implicate yourself.

2:14:33.426 --> 2:14:35.192
You ain't stupid enough for that kid.

2:14:35.525 --> 2:14:36.592
I should kill you, right now?

2:14:39.158 --> 2:14:41.158
I don't think your aims that good kid.

2:14:41.591 --> 2:14:43.191
To hell with you Cliff Smart!

2:14:46.457 --> 2:14:47.924
That boy attacked my wife!

2:14:48.724 --> 2:14:50.290
Stop or I'll shoot!

2:15:12.654 --> 2:15:14.154
As I walked around the crime scene,

2:15:14.154 --> 2:15:15.520
I saw Veronica's body

2:15:15.520 --> 2:15:17.586
laid on the floor next to Jimmys.

2:15:17.586 --> 2:15:19.719
A table next to the chair, had an ashtray

2:15:19.719 --> 2:15:21.453
on and a half smoked cigarette.

2:15:22.052 --> 2:15:23.986
Veronica had been caught by surprise,

2:15:24.852 --> 2:15:26.285
Jimmy's body laid next to her

2:15:26.285 --> 2:15:27.918
with his eyes wide open with fear.

2:15:29.418 --> 2:15:31.218
I feel like I died alongside her.

2:15:32.951 --> 2:15:33.951
Does that sound normal?

2:15:34.751 --> 2:15:36.084
I notice that Cliff didn't have

2:15:36.084 --> 2:15:37.384
a single tear in his eye.

2:15:38.350 --> 2:15:39.583
I feel empty.

2:15:40.750 --> 2:15:42.316
I've seen the pain etched in the faces

2:15:42.316 --> 2:15:43.450
of those left behind,

2:15:43.450 --> 2:15:44.649
as reality dawns on them

2:15:44.649 --> 2:15:45.283
that death has changed

2:15:45.283 --> 2:15:45.983
everything for them.

2:15:46.949 --> 2:15:48.516
This should have been

2:15:48.516 --> 2:15:49.715
another routine visit,

2:15:49.715 --> 2:15:51.349
but something about it felt off.

2:15:51.948 --> 2:15:54.515
And it all came down to Cliff Smart.

2:15:54.515 --> 2:15:56.381
Now, Mr. Smart,

2:15:57.514 --> 2:15:59.248
can you tell me if you have any idea

2:15:59.248 --> 2:16:01.247
why these two young men would want

2:16:01.247 --> 2:16:02.880
you and your wife killed?

2:16:05.147 --> 2:16:06.147
Yeah, but

2:16:07.980 --> 2:16:09.213
I don't want to tarnish

2:16:09.213 --> 2:16:10.679
the memory of my wife now.

2:16:10.846 --> 2:16:11.646
She's...

2:16:12.179 --> 2:16:12.712
Dead?

2:16:12.879 --> 2:16:13.446
Yeah.

2:16:16.279 --> 2:16:16.645
I mean,

2:16:18.712 --> 2:16:19.312
well, you see,

2:16:21.145 --> 2:16:23.078
she's been spending a lot of time

2:16:23.078 --> 2:16:25.177
with the kid, Jimmy.

2:16:26.744 --> 2:16:28.277
I think he'd fallen in love with her.

2:16:29.677 --> 2:16:31.943
I'd, um, suspected for a while.

2:16:31.943 --> 2:16:34.442
She used to teach him see,

2:16:34.442 --> 2:16:36.609
she gave him private acting lessons.

2:16:36.609 --> 2:16:38.208
And every time I saw him, like

2:16:39.309 --> 2:16:41.242
I saw the way he looked at her,

2:16:41.242 --> 2:16:42.842
I mean, I hate to say it, but

2:16:44.142 --> 2:16:45.940
at times my um, my wife didn't

2:16:47.141 --> 2:16:49.274
dissuade his flirtations.

2:16:52.007 --> 2:16:54.707
Were the two, intimate?

2:16:56.307 --> 2:16:57.172
Yeah. Yeah,

2:16:59.106 --> 2:16:59.773
I think so.

2:17:01.839 --> 2:17:02.606
I think he thought

2:17:02.606 --> 2:17:03.939
they'd be together in the future.

2:17:04.805 --> 2:17:05.472
You know,

2:17:06.505 --> 2:17:07.738
there was something real strange

2:17:07.738 --> 2:17:09.072
about this kid Detective.

2:17:10.904 --> 2:17:12.838
He had something real dark in his eyes.

2:17:13.738 --> 2:17:16.103
He was clearly, very troubled.

2:17:16.271 --> 2:17:18.136
Did he say anything

2:17:18.136 --> 2:17:19.237
when they turned up tonight?

2:17:19.869 --> 2:17:23.036
He just stormed in in a rage

2:17:23.036 --> 2:17:24.602
and just kept screaming

2:17:24.602 --> 2:17:25.969
that Veronica had to go with him.

2:17:25.969 --> 2:17:28.568
But Veronica just kept saying

2:17:28.568 --> 2:17:30.702
that he was just a little boy and that

2:17:32.101 --> 2:17:33.035
she was married

2:17:34.168 --> 2:17:35.235
and she loved me,

2:17:37.201 --> 2:17:38.268
but he wouldn't accept it.

2:17:39.434 --> 2:17:41.701
He just kept screaming his love for her.

2:17:42.900 --> 2:17:43.867
Eventually he said,

2:17:45.200 --> 2:17:47.332
if I can't have her, then nobody can.

2:17:48.266 --> 2:17:48.900
Oh, God.

2:17:51.766 --> 2:17:52.366
Then he shot her.

2:17:53.966 --> 2:17:55.132
I mean, I tried to shield it,

2:17:55.132 --> 2:17:57.764
but he shot me as well.

2:17:58.932 --> 2:18:03.498
Lucky for me I managed to fall

2:18:03.498 --> 2:18:05.131
near the drawer where I keep my gun.

2:18:05.164 --> 2:18:07.263
So I just about managed

2:18:07.564 --> 2:18:08.897
to let off one shot.

2:18:08.964 --> 2:18:10.230
Straight through the heart.

2:18:10.363 --> 2:18:11.029
I just shot.

2:18:11.029 --> 2:18:11.830
I didn't aim.

2:18:14.929 --> 2:18:16.696
I just wish I could have saved her.

2:18:17.862 --> 2:18:21.462
Still no tears, an actor Cliff was not.

2:18:22.928 --> 2:18:23.962
What about the other boy?

2:18:26.195 --> 2:18:26.695
Oh, yeah.

2:18:28.493 --> 2:18:29.394
He didn't say much.

2:18:31.527 --> 2:18:33.327
I mean, once I'd managed to kill Jimmy,

2:18:33.560 --> 2:18:35.093
in self-defense, um, he, he,

2:18:35.093 --> 2:18:37.526
he ran out of the house,

2:18:39.093 --> 2:18:40.793
and then you fine men turned up.

2:18:41.993 --> 2:18:42.492
I see.

2:18:43.492 --> 2:18:44.026
Well, it all seems

2:18:44.026 --> 2:18:45.325
pretty straightforward to me,

2:18:45.325 --> 2:18:46.659
but you might want to get

2:18:46.659 --> 2:18:47.525
that wound looked at.

2:18:48.558 --> 2:18:51.858
If you ask me, you're very lucky

2:18:51.858 --> 2:18:53.457
it just grazed you.

2:18:53.457 --> 2:18:54.724
God must have intervened.

2:18:57.389 --> 2:18:58.189
Indeed.

2:19:02.256 --> 2:19:04.490
Vivian, please sit down,

2:19:04.490 --> 2:19:05.789
I've got something to tell you.

2:19:05.789 --> 2:19:07.722
Mother, I have to go.

2:19:07.722 --> 2:19:09.022
Veronica never showed last night

2:19:09.022 --> 2:19:09.822
and I can't find Riff.

2:19:09.822 --> 2:19:11.289
I need to make sure that he stops...

2:19:11.455 --> 2:19:12.189
Stops what?

2:19:14.421 --> 2:19:15.088
Teenage drama mother.

2:19:15.555 --> 2:19:16.555
You don't need to know everything.

2:19:17.620 --> 2:19:18.554
Vivian, please.

2:19:18.988 --> 2:19:20.087
It's terribly important.

2:19:20.386 --> 2:19:21.521
I said I have to go.

2:19:22.154 --> 2:19:23.520
Mrs Smart.

2:19:25.587 --> 2:19:27.020
She's dead.

2:19:31.053 --> 2:19:34.419
Vivian, oh Vivian.

2:19:38.185 --> 2:19:42.084
Jimmy's also dead, and Riff, well,

2:19:43.618 --> 2:19:44.418
it's not looking good

2:19:44.418 --> 2:19:45.451
for him, he's in a coma.

2:19:46.617 --> 2:19:47.350
What?

2:19:48.750 --> 2:19:49.384
They were murdered

2:19:49.384 --> 2:19:50.550
last night at her home.

2:19:50.550 --> 2:19:51.450
They say... What?

2:19:51.650 --> 2:19:53.815
What do they say?

2:19:56.483 --> 2:19:58.582
They say that Jimmy was in love with her.

2:20:00.015 --> 2:20:01.449
She turned him down

2:20:01.449 --> 2:20:03.215
and Jimmy shot Veronica.

2:20:03.215 --> 2:20:04.348
Cliff got off one shot

2:20:04.348 --> 2:20:05.814
and then shot Jimmy dead?

2:20:06.181 --> 2:20:07.914
No, you're lying,

2:20:08.481 --> 2:20:11.014
Cliff is dead, Cliff Smart is dead.

2:20:11.714 --> 2:20:13.080
Cliff's fine. No, you're lying.

2:20:13.114 --> 2:20:14.614
I don't lie Vivian.

2:20:15.113 --> 2:20:17.446
How could she be dead,

2:20:18.246 --> 2:20:20.512
and how could Jimmy kill her,

2:20:20.512 --> 2:20:23.112
he couldn't, he wouldn't kill her.

2:20:23.712 --> 2:20:25.445
Sometimes you don't see what's going on

2:20:25.445 --> 2:20:26.112
even with the people

2:20:26.145 --> 2:20:27.244
that you're closest to.

2:20:27.712 --> 2:20:29.712
Riff, oh, God.

2:20:30.111 --> 2:20:31.911
Riff why didn't you stop it,

2:20:31.911 --> 2:20:32.844
why did you join in?

2:20:34.011 --> 2:20:35.277
Oh Vivian, what can I do?

2:20:36.277 --> 2:20:37.344
He took her from me.

2:20:38.077 --> 2:20:38.844
From us.

2:20:40.010 --> 2:20:42.343
Jimmy was obviously very confused.

2:20:43.276 --> 2:20:44.643
She was my only friend.

2:20:46.343 --> 2:20:47.576
She was the only person

2:20:47.576 --> 2:20:48.742
who ever believed in me.

2:20:48.909 --> 2:20:49.842
That's not true.

2:20:49.842 --> 2:20:51.275
I've always believed in you.

2:20:51.275 --> 2:20:54.175
How can she not be here anymore.

2:20:54.608 --> 2:20:56.575
Oh God mother, it hurts.

2:20:59.974 --> 2:21:01.007
it's OK.

2:21:01.374 --> 2:21:02.074
It's OK.

2:21:02.141 --> 2:21:06.607
It's OK to be sad.

2:21:06.939 --> 2:21:07.740
Sad?

2:21:08.606 --> 2:21:10.839
Sad, he took her from me.

2:21:11.839 --> 2:21:14.606
Oh, no, my head is spinning.

2:21:14.905 --> 2:21:16.005
God, mother

2:21:16.005 --> 2:21:17.738
she was my ticket out of here,

2:21:17.738 --> 2:21:19.538
she was going to make me a star.

2:21:22.005 --> 2:21:23.871
Let me get you some hot tea.

2:21:23.871 --> 2:21:25.604
I don't need hot tea.

2:21:25.604 --> 2:21:27.404
I need to make him pay.

2:21:28.437 --> 2:21:30.037
Jimmy paid with his life, Vivian.

2:21:30.737 --> 2:21:31.303
Jimmy?

2:21:31.303 --> 2:21:34.203
Oh mother, you have no idea

2:21:34.270 --> 2:21:35.569
what you're talking about.

2:21:35.569 --> 2:21:37.003
Then talk to me, please.

2:21:37.003 --> 2:21:38.702
Mother, I need to be alone.

2:21:40.135 --> 2:21:40.669
Vivian, please.

2:21:40.669 --> 2:21:42.902
I said, get out, mother,

2:21:43.101 --> 2:21:44.768
get out, get out, get out.

2:21:45.368 --> 2:21:47.401
I never want to see you again.

2:21:47.401 --> 2:21:49.668
Get out, I never want to see you anymore.

2:21:53.167 --> 2:21:53.967
No.

2:22:00.332 --> 2:22:01.799
Oh God. No. No.

2:22:04.866 --> 2:22:06.465
How can he do this.

2:22:38.028 --> 2:22:39.828
The innocence of youth was lost.

2:22:40.394 --> 2:22:41.094
The paths they took

2:22:41.094 --> 2:22:42.661
led to their own downfall.

2:22:43.493 --> 2:22:44.660
Veronica had destroyed

2:22:44.694 --> 2:22:46.260
everybody to get what she wanted

2:22:46.860 --> 2:22:48.626
and if she went to hell, I'm

2:22:48.626 --> 2:22:49.725
sure even the devil

2:22:49.725 --> 2:22:50.725
wouldn't recognize her.

2:22:51.593 --> 2:22:52.593
It's two days later

2:22:53.026 --> 2:22:54.026
and Cliff was finished

2:22:54.026 --> 2:22:55.225
playing the grieving husband.

2:22:55.659 --> 2:22:57.492
In fact, Cliff had a secret of his own.

2:23:01.690 --> 2:23:02.658
Get over here, baby.

2:23:03.824 --> 2:23:05.557
I got you a brandy darling

2:23:05.557 --> 2:23:06.491
just how you like it.

2:23:06.991 --> 2:23:08.757
God, I'm so grateful

2:23:08.757 --> 2:23:09.957
to have you at my side.

2:23:11.257 --> 2:23:13.655
So, Cliff, Veronica never knew.

2:23:13.990 --> 2:23:15.422
She never knew that we didn't break up?

2:23:15.889 --> 2:23:16.756
Never had a clue.

2:23:17.356 --> 2:23:18.889
Went to her grave, none the wiser.

2:23:19.822 --> 2:23:20.755
I still can't believe

2:23:20.755 --> 2:23:22.322
she was murdered in this house.

2:23:22.522 --> 2:23:24.421
Yeah, tough break.

2:23:25.455 --> 2:23:27.755
I mean, we had our disagreements, but

2:23:28.788 --> 2:23:29.721
I never wanted her dead,

2:23:30.421 --> 2:23:31.386
even after all she did.

2:23:31.921 --> 2:23:34.087
You are handling it so well.

2:23:34.554 --> 2:23:35.886
It can't be easy for you.

2:23:36.853 --> 2:23:38.619
The pain will always be there.

2:23:38.619 --> 2:23:39.886
And that's because you're such

2:23:39.886 --> 2:23:41.019
a good man, Cliff Smart.

2:23:41.353 --> 2:23:42.553
And you're going to make

2:23:42.553 --> 2:23:44.252
a wonderful father to our baby.

2:23:45.019 --> 2:23:46.919
A little Cliff running around.

2:23:46.919 --> 2:23:48.085
Or Lana.

2:23:48.818 --> 2:23:49.718
I'm so grateful

2:23:49.718 --> 2:23:51.151
you decided against doing your show.

2:23:51.151 --> 2:23:53.918
Now you're with child.

2:23:53.918 --> 2:23:55.451
No wife of mine will be

2:23:55.451 --> 2:23:56.317
burdened with work.

2:23:57.517 --> 2:23:58.884
You're a housewife and a mother.

2:23:59.984 --> 2:24:01.117
The greatest job there is.

2:24:03.016 --> 2:24:04.315
Are you expecting anybody?

2:24:05.183 --> 2:24:05.483
No.

2:24:05.815 --> 2:24:07.216
Don't you move, I'll get it.

2:24:07.216 --> 2:24:09.116
You'll do nothing of the sort.

2:24:09.116 --> 2:24:10.182
Let me get it.

2:24:10.182 --> 2:24:11.582
I'll be waiting in the bedroom for you

2:24:11.582 --> 2:24:12.182
Cliffy.

2:24:12.615 --> 2:24:13.282
Lana.

2:24:14.482 --> 2:24:15.415
I ain't going to waste

2:24:15.415 --> 2:24:16.448
my second chance at love, baby.

2:24:23.514 --> 2:24:24.614
Cliff reached out for

2:24:24.614 --> 2:24:26.347
the door and opened it,

2:24:26.947 --> 2:24:29.279
and so his surprise, he sees Veronica

2:24:29.279 --> 2:24:30.746
stood there with her back to him.

2:24:31.646 --> 2:24:32.546
He's taken aback,

2:24:33.179 --> 2:24:34.312
but a moment later,

2:24:34.312 --> 2:24:35.612
the woman turns around

2:24:35.612 --> 2:24:36.645
and it's not Veronica.

2:24:37.011 --> 2:24:38.845
It's Vivian, dressed

2:24:38.845 --> 2:24:40.212
in a killer red dress,

2:24:40.212 --> 2:24:42.145
she looks just like Veronica.

2:24:44.044 --> 2:24:45.278
What the hell do you want?

2:24:46.711 --> 2:24:47.844
Why are you dressed like that?

2:24:48.177 --> 2:24:50.444
Well, Cliffy, I have a message for you.

2:24:51.310 --> 2:24:52.410
Who is it, sweetheart?

2:24:53.510 --> 2:24:54.576
Well what the hell kind of message

2:24:54.576 --> 2:24:55.410
would you have for me?

2:24:56.009 --> 2:24:57.176
It's simple, Cliffy.

2:24:57.609 --> 2:24:58.342
It's from Veronica.

2:24:59.475 --> 2:25:00.742
Veronica's dead.

2:25:00.742 --> 2:25:04.475
Yes Cliffy, and she's real mad about it.

2:25:23.306 --> 2:25:24.339
LANA!!

2:25:25.405 --> 2:25:26.572
Aaaahhhhh!!!

2:25:49.402 --> 2:25:50.101
Vivian would be arrested

2:25:50.601 --> 2:25:52.235
and sent to a mental institution

2:25:52.469 --> 2:25:54.235
where she would remain for years.

2:25:56.768 --> 2:25:58.901
Vivian Pierce, this sweet girl

2:25:58.901 --> 2:26:00.668
with a bright future ahead of her

2:26:00.668 --> 2:26:01.867
had now vanished.

2:26:02.434 --> 2:26:03.567
All that was left,

2:26:03.567 --> 2:26:05.333
a broken shell of a girl

2:26:05.634 --> 2:26:07.067
who soul seems to have been

2:26:07.067 --> 2:26:08.933
completely removed from her body.

2:26:09.500 --> 2:26:10.832
Her mother and loyal friend

2:26:10.832 --> 2:26:12.133
will be her only visitors.

2:26:12.499 --> 2:26:15.099
And even then, Jean never gets to truly

2:26:15.466 --> 2:26:16.132
see her daughter.

2:26:17.564 --> 2:26:18.232
It would be a week later,

2:26:18.598 --> 2:26:21.331
when Riff opened his eyes, and his mouth.

2:26:22.365 --> 2:26:24.530
Yeah, he told us the whole sordid story.

2:26:25.030 --> 2:26:26.231
It was only at that moment

2:26:26.431 --> 2:26:27.731
that everything fell into place.

2:26:28.231 --> 2:26:29.630
The affair, the murder

2:26:29.630 --> 2:26:31.097
plot, thedouble cross.

2:26:31.097 --> 2:26:32.330
It was something that

2:26:32.330 --> 2:26:33.696
even the best Hollywood writers

2:26:33.696 --> 2:26:34.363
ccoudn't have dreamed up.

2:26:36.229 --> 2:26:37.896
Riff would be sent to jail for 10 years

2:26:37.896 --> 2:26:39.396
for the murder of Veronica Smart.

2:26:39.962 --> 2:26:40.994
But he's using the time

2:26:40.994 --> 2:26:42.462
to better himself,

2:26:42.462 --> 2:26:44.162
to learn himself a trade.

2:26:44.162 --> 2:26:45.994
God, please let one positive come

2:26:45.994 --> 2:26:46.728
from this tragedy.

2:26:47.728 --> 2:26:48.928
In all my years,

2:26:48.928 --> 2:26:49.828
I had never seen a more

2:26:49.828 --> 2:26:51.327
twisted or tragic story

2:26:51.827 --> 2:26:53.527
from one teenage boys fantasy

2:26:53.794 --> 2:26:55.794
and one manipulative woman's motives came

2:26:55.794 --> 2:26:57.027
the murders of Jimmy Flynn,

2:26:57.327 --> 2:26:59.126
Cliff Smart and Veronica Smart.

2:26:59.793 --> 2:27:01.458
The tragedy wouldn't end there, however,

2:27:01.458 --> 2:27:03.859
the implications were far and wide.

2:27:04.192 --> 2:27:05.392
It would be too much for Harvey.

2:27:05.892 --> 2:27:08.359
He will blame himself for how hard

2:27:08.359 --> 2:27:09.725
he had been towards his son, a charge

2:27:09.725 --> 2:27:10.858
he was sadly guilty of.

2:27:11.358 --> 2:27:13.291
So on a cold winter night,

2:27:13.690 --> 2:27:15.291
Harvey Flynn took a large drink

2:27:15.291 --> 2:27:16.324
from his bottle of whiskey,

2:27:16.891 --> 2:27:17.891
picks up his pistol,

2:27:18.291 --> 2:27:19.724
aimed it at his head and.

2:27:21.257 --> 2:27:23.323
Well, he didn't pull the trigger,

2:27:24.123 --> 2:27:24.890
stopping himself

2:27:24.890 --> 2:27:26.155
becoming the latest victim

2:27:26.155 --> 2:27:26.922
of this tragedy.

2:27:28.522 --> 2:27:30.789
As for me, well, I left the force.

2:27:31.689 --> 2:27:33.522
The case lingered over every move I made.

2:27:34.322 --> 2:27:35.488
This ain't like the movies,

2:27:35.822 --> 2:27:37.521
the detective doesn't always get his man.

2:27:38.421 --> 2:27:40.288
So now I write pulp detective novels

2:27:40.654 --> 2:27:42.787
like this one you witnessed, it's

2:27:42.787 --> 2:27:44.720
cathartic in a way, it helps me release

2:27:44.820 --> 2:27:45.820
the nightmares I see

2:27:45.820 --> 2:27:47.053
in my sleep to the page.

2:27:47.053 --> 2:27:49.186
It helps me to put them to bed for good.

2:27:50.186 --> 2:27:51.153
Now it's your nightmare.

2:27:52.553 --> 2:27:54.618
You see, the city is a scary place.

2:27:54.618 --> 2:27:56.152
nobody is what they seem.

2:27:56.851 --> 2:27:58.419
Evil doesn't always hide around

2:27:58.419 --> 2:28:00.185
dark corners, and innocence

2:28:01.018 --> 2:28:03.218
doesn't automatically mean innocent.

2:28:03.218 --> 2:28:05.684
People are far more complex than that.

2:28:06.583 --> 2:28:07.284
In this case,

2:28:08.550 --> 2:28:09.850
they showed me the horrific acts

2:28:09.850 --> 2:28:11.283
that people can do to one another

2:28:12.017 --> 2:28:13.050
over a beautiful

2:28:13.383 --> 2:28:14.483
but unworthy woman.

2:28:15.850 --> 2:28:17.916
See, nobody is truly bad

2:28:17.916 --> 2:28:19.682
or good, right or wrong.

2:28:20.382 --> 2:28:21.482
Human existence is far

2:28:21.482 --> 2:28:22.715
more complicated than that.

2:28:23.748 --> 2:28:25.314
And that's the scariest thing of all,

2:28:26.314 --> 2:28:27.748
because you can never see it coming.

2:28:29.414 --> 2:28:30.280
This is my city,

2:28:31.247 --> 2:28:32.447
and I prided myself on

2:28:32.447 --> 2:28:33.614
solving every case

2:28:33.614 --> 2:28:34.779
that came across my desk.
