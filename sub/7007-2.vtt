00:03.903 --> 00:05.393
Still peeling potatoes?

00:05.471 --> 00:07.099
Potato.

00:07.640 --> 00:10.905
Takes longer to peel these things
than it does to grow them.

00:11.811 --> 00:14.939
Wow. I'm surprised you haven't
developed the Power Peeler.

00:16.983 --> 00:18.507
Hey.

00:20.587 --> 00:21.713
Hi.

00:21.788 --> 00:23.881
- Hi.
- Great news.

00:23.957 --> 00:28.519
I got accepted
in a special program at school.

00:28.628 --> 00:30.493
I'm gonna be counseling families.

00:30.563 --> 00:32.827
Well, congratulations, Jill.

00:32.899 --> 00:34.423
I am so excited.

00:34.501 --> 00:37.800
I get to implement some
of these techniques I've been studying.

00:37.871 --> 00:40.772
If you get stuck,
try my counseling technique.

00:40.840 --> 00:44.401
"People, people, get over it!"

00:48.915 --> 00:50.974
Tim, as helpful as that is,

00:51.051 --> 00:53.952
I think kindness
is a more effective approach.

00:54.020 --> 00:57.114
- Mom, there's no food.
- I use compassion and sensitivity

00:57.190 --> 01:00.091
- to nurture people, like a flower.
- Mom, Mom!

01:00.160 --> 01:03.823
- What?
- When are you gonna go to the store?

01:03.897 --> 01:05.831
I'll go when I'm good and ready to go!

01:05.899 --> 01:10.359
If you don't like the food in the house,
go to the store yourself or starve!

01:11.604 --> 01:14.334
Now, that flower
you were talking about...

01:15.742 --> 01:18.006
Did you say "nurture" or "torture"?

01:20.000 --> 01:26.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:09.395 --> 02:11.454
We're having potatoes again tonight?

02:11.531 --> 02:12.657
Yes.

02:13.800 --> 02:17.964
This electric potato peeler will take
all the hassle out of peeling potatoes.

02:26.813 --> 02:28.178
I got it.

02:31.117 --> 02:32.550
Hey, what's up, Ronny?

02:33.853 --> 02:37.721
Hey, Mark, wait. Why don't you
introduce us to your friend?

02:37.790 --> 02:41.351
Fine. Ronny, that's my mom.
That's my dad.

02:41.461 --> 02:42.894
- Hi.
- Hey, Ronny.

02:43.796 --> 02:45.127
'Sup?

02:54.474 --> 02:55.907
Was that a...?

02:55.975 --> 02:59.138
Was that a boy wearing a dog collar
or a dog with a boy's head?

03:02.348 --> 03:05.511
Well, I finally got my next topic
for the school paper.

03:05.585 --> 03:09.544
I'm gonna write about what local
companies are doing for the environment.

03:09.656 --> 03:13.023
- That's a fantastic idea.
- Why don't you write about Binford?

03:13.092 --> 03:16.255
They've got programs.
Recycling, water conservation...

03:16.329 --> 03:19.765
They even tried to get your dad
to carpool with Al.

03:19.832 --> 03:22.528
You can only
love your planet so much, honey.

03:23.670 --> 03:26.195
Writing about Binford
sounds like a good idea.

03:26.272 --> 03:29.503
I'll get you some pamphlets
on their environmental policy.

03:29.576 --> 03:32.443
Probably cleared a rain forest
just to print them.

03:32.512 --> 03:35.345
You know, Randy,
I was a social activist in high school.

03:35.415 --> 03:37.576
I was involved in the feminist movement.

03:37.684 --> 03:40.983
Went to rallies where hundreds of women
burned their bras.

03:41.054 --> 03:42.988
I cheered those women on.

03:48.461 --> 03:52.898
Well, Dad, you always have been known
for your great social conscience.

03:52.966 --> 03:57.335
In high school I spent eight months
trying to save an endangered species.

03:57.403 --> 04:00.167
- Really? Which one?
- The muscle car.

04:03.910 --> 04:07.937
Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Hansen.
I'm Jill Taylor, your counseling intern.

04:08.014 --> 04:10.175
Nice to meet you.

04:10.283 --> 04:11.841
Well.

04:12.719 --> 04:14.084
Before we begin,

04:14.187 --> 04:18.351
I'd like to talk a little bit
about my methodology.

04:19.024 --> 04:23.860
I am an avid proponent of
emotionally-focused couples therapy,

04:23.930 --> 04:28.299
which is founded on the belief that
couples hide their primary emotions

04:28.401 --> 04:30.733
and instead exhibit secondary emotions,

04:30.803 --> 04:33.271
which result in negative interactions,

04:33.339 --> 04:35.364
such as pursue-slash-distance,

04:35.441 --> 04:37.671
or blame-slash-withdraw.

04:37.744 --> 04:42.704
Serving as a defense against
the more vulnerable primary emotions.

04:48.755 --> 04:50.723
Any questions?

04:50.823 --> 04:53.986
Are you the only therapist
or can we get someone else?

05:00.933 --> 05:02.093
- Hi.
- Hi.

05:08.775 --> 05:09.935
Potatoes again.

05:10.710 --> 05:13.201
- You bet.
- What have you done to my peeler?

05:13.279 --> 05:15.839
What was once electric
is now pneumatic.

05:17.984 --> 05:20.953
I can shear 50 pounds of potatoes
in six seconds.

05:27.960 --> 05:29.723
You must be so proud.

05:31.364 --> 05:35.926
I have my days.
How did your first day of counseling go?

05:36.002 --> 05:37.492
Don't ask.

05:37.570 --> 05:40.698
This couple did not get that
secondary reactive emotions

05:40.773 --> 05:42.434
lead to negative interaction.

05:45.311 --> 05:46.869
Wow.

05:47.547 --> 05:49.811
Some people are so thick.

05:51.250 --> 05:55.584
Dad, I was just doing some research
on Binford for my article.

05:55.655 --> 05:58.886
- Did you read the pamphlets I gave you?
- Then I got on the Internet

05:58.958 --> 06:02.724
and got Pollution Watcher's top ten list
for Detroit. Binford's on here.

06:02.795 --> 06:05.059
Binford made the top ten?
All right!

06:07.367 --> 06:10.598
No, Dad, it's a list of the top ten
biggest polluters.

06:11.437 --> 06:12.768
Binford?

06:12.839 --> 06:15.399
I didn't know Binford had a problem
with pollution.

06:15.475 --> 06:16.942
They don't have a problem!

06:17.009 --> 06:19.500
These environmentalists
tend to overreact.

06:21.414 --> 06:23.143
You know, just like the dentist.

06:24.717 --> 06:28.813
Those wussy dentists that scurry out
of the room when the x-ray goes on.

06:31.924 --> 06:34.825
Dad, it's right on the printout.

06:35.561 --> 06:39.258
You know, just because you read it
on the Internet does not make it true.

06:39.332 --> 06:42.961
You want to find the facts? I'll set up
an interview with Bud Harper.

06:43.035 --> 06:46.801
You think the president of Binford's
gonna want to meet with a kid?

06:46.873 --> 06:50.934
Maybe I'll remind him the kid's father
is Binford's biggest TV star.

06:52.044 --> 06:56.174
Who just spent a whole week inventing
the world's stupidest potato peeler.

06:59.352 --> 07:02.480
Get back to me with those
third quarter projections, OK?

07:02.555 --> 07:03.988
Yeah. OK, bye.

07:05.658 --> 07:07.956
- Hey, Bud.
- Hey, Tim, how's it going?

07:08.027 --> 07:09.858
- Pretty good. Yourself?
- Great.

07:09.929 --> 07:12.295
- You know my son, Randy.
- Of course, I do.

07:12.365 --> 07:14.492
How could I forget the little guy?

07:14.567 --> 07:16.501
You still on the soccer team, huh?

07:16.569 --> 07:18.867
Uh, no, that's my older brother, Brad.

07:19.439 --> 07:22.602
Oh, oh, oh, you're the karate kid.

07:22.708 --> 07:24.266
No, that's Mark.

07:25.111 --> 07:26.442
Oh.

07:26.512 --> 07:27.843
Well, what do you do?

07:29.215 --> 07:32.446
I'm a journalist and I have
some tough questions for you.

07:32.518 --> 07:35.578
You better come clean, Bud,
or your name will be mud

07:35.655 --> 07:39.682
<i>- in the Lakeside High Reporter.
- Oooh. We can't have that, huh?</i>

07:42.595 --> 07:44.859
- Can we start now?
- Well, sure.

07:44.931 --> 07:49.027
Sure, I'll be happy to answer any
questions, young man. Have a seat.

07:50.803 --> 07:53.294
Well, Mr. Harper,
according to my sources...

07:53.372 --> 07:55.704
According to his sources!

08:00.413 --> 08:03.974
According to my sources, your company
has a poor pollution record.

08:04.050 --> 08:05.210
How do you respond?

08:05.284 --> 08:09.948
Son, Binford is a responsible
corporate citizen.

08:10.022 --> 08:12.923
We are committed
to protecting our environment.

08:14.360 --> 08:17.261
Then why does Pollution Watch
call Binford, and I quote,

08:17.330 --> 08:19.491
"an egregious environmental offender"?

08:19.599 --> 08:23.091
Why aren't you doing anything to reduce
emissions from your plants?

08:23.169 --> 08:25.694
He's quite the little Dickens, isn't he?

08:26.539 --> 08:28.097
Yes, he is.

08:29.008 --> 08:31.169
But what the little Dickens
doesn't know is,

08:31.277 --> 08:34.440
we're in the planning stages
of a new emission reduction system.

08:34.547 --> 08:36.207
But even at our present rate,

08:36.282 --> 08:41.049
all Binford plants fully comply
with government regulations.

08:41.153 --> 08:44.246
There you have it,
from the horse's mouth. No offense.

08:44.323 --> 08:46.484
None taken.
Tim, how's your golf game?

08:46.559 --> 08:47.992
Pretty good. Broke 90.

08:48.060 --> 08:49.891
- Yeah?
- I got two golf can'ts.

08:53.266 --> 08:57.498
Well, isn't it true that Binford buys
pollution credits from other companies?

08:58.871 --> 09:01.237
- Yes, it is.
- What are pollution credits?

09:01.340 --> 09:05.470
Each company in an industrial zone is
allotted a certain amount of emissions.

09:05.545 --> 09:08.036
If one company doesn't use
their entire share,

09:08.114 --> 09:10.947
they can sell pollution credits
to another company.

09:11.017 --> 09:14.248
- A good example of corporate teamwork.
- It's corporate bull.

09:14.320 --> 09:17.289
Binford's found a loophole
to pollute more than it should.

09:17.356 --> 09:19.517
- Don't you think that's sleazy?
- Wait.

09:19.592 --> 09:22.254
What we're doing is legal.
We won't need the credits

09:22.328 --> 09:24.626
once our emission control system
is in place.

09:24.697 --> 09:27.598
- How long's that gonna take?
- Roughly ten years.

09:27.667 --> 09:30.830
- Ten years? That's a joke.
- Hey, let's not be rude here.

09:30.903 --> 09:34.202
Wait, Tim. He doesn't understand
how business works.

09:34.273 --> 09:37.640
You see, rushing a plan like this
could affect jobs,

09:37.743 --> 09:40.041
and Binford's financial well-being.

09:40.112 --> 09:42.478
What about the well-being
of the environment?

09:42.582 --> 09:46.074
Without clean air to breathe,
you don't have customers to buy tools.

09:46.152 --> 09:48.985
Besides, do people really need
14 types of hacksaws?

09:49.055 --> 09:50.352
People do!

09:52.124 --> 09:54.490
Mr. Harper,
I was always taught to believe

09:54.594 --> 09:56.562
that Binford was a company that cared.

09:56.629 --> 09:59.996
It seems all you care about
is making money no matter who you hurt.

10:00.066 --> 10:02.125
I think this interview's over.

10:02.201 --> 10:04.465
Thank you very much for your time, Bud.

10:04.537 --> 10:07.097
- Come on, come on!
- Dad!

10:09.609 --> 10:11.338
You were completely out of line!

10:11.410 --> 10:14.937
Binford's out of line, sweeping
their pollution problem under the rug,

10:15.014 --> 10:18.040
- so they can maximize profits.
- Quiet down, all right?

10:18.117 --> 10:22.019
When you get older you'll understand
not everything is so cut and dry.

10:22.989 --> 10:24.479
I understand right now, Dad.

10:24.557 --> 10:27.219
You're taking the company line.
You're a sell-out.

10:27.293 --> 10:30.057
- You called me a sell-out?
- I called you a sell-out.

10:30.162 --> 10:34.121
Then again, to be a sell-out, you'd have
to have principles to begin with.

10:35.301 --> 10:38.134
Hey! I not only have principles,
I'm your ride home.

10:42.274 --> 10:44.606
I'll take public transportation.

10:44.677 --> 10:46.975
Hey, don't use your fancy words with me.

10:48.948 --> 10:50.643
It's called a bus!

10:58.991 --> 11:00.117
I'm going out.

11:00.660 --> 11:01.991
OK, have fun.

11:04.030 --> 11:05.725
I'll get it.

11:07.266 --> 11:09.496
Ronny left his dog collar upstairs.

11:09.568 --> 11:10.660
Oh.

11:13.639 --> 11:16.608
Wouldrt want to go anywhere
without that dog collar.

11:17.977 --> 11:20.445
They could throw you in the pound.

11:29.922 --> 11:32.288
So, Ronny, what's been going on?

11:33.125 --> 11:34.285
Stuff.

11:35.261 --> 11:37.024
You know, Ronny,

11:37.129 --> 11:40.496
I know it's difficult for adolescents
to be forthcoming

11:40.599 --> 11:42.760
with unfamiliar authority figures.

11:42.835 --> 11:46.794
It's understandable. Teenage years
are a particularly alienating time,

11:46.872 --> 11:48.897
you know, developmentally speaking.

11:48.974 --> 11:52.535
I am the kind of person
who's interested in young people

11:52.611 --> 11:55.273
and willing to listen,

11:55.347 --> 11:59.113
in a non-judgmental,
unthreatening manner.

12:00.553 --> 12:01.713
Later.

12:06.025 --> 12:07.390
What did I say?

12:08.461 --> 12:10.122
Stuff.

12:12.598 --> 12:14.031
Later.

12:18.003 --> 12:19.664
- What's wrong?
- Stuff.

12:21.874 --> 12:24.604
Randy completely embarrassed me
in Bud's office.

12:24.677 --> 12:26.406
He called me a sell-out.

12:26.479 --> 12:29.846
That doesn't sound like Randy.
He's always so sweet and polite.

12:29.949 --> 12:33.077
That's over.
We'd be better off with Dog-boy.

12:35.588 --> 12:37.317
Hey, how was your bus ride?

12:37.389 --> 12:39.357
Mom, I'm going to write my article.

12:39.458 --> 12:41.619
Not until you get the facts straight!

12:41.694 --> 12:44.458
So, now you're telling me
what I can and can't write?

12:44.563 --> 12:47.191
You're acting like
some tyrannical fascist.

12:48.467 --> 12:50.401
Did he just call me a dinosaur?

12:55.875 --> 12:58.139
Where does he get off,
writing about Binford?

12:58.677 --> 13:01.771
- It was your idea.
- Oh, throw that in my face.

13:03.215 --> 13:05.115
Randy is young and idealistic.

13:05.184 --> 13:08.642
He's gonna get carried away
with things that are important to him.

13:08.721 --> 13:10.655
What if this is just the beginning?

13:11.657 --> 13:14.785
What if he tells us
we can't wear leather or eat meat?

13:14.860 --> 13:17.693
Or he starts
falling in love with dolphins

13:17.763 --> 13:20.323
and he says
we've got to throw out all our tuna?

13:20.399 --> 13:22.697
I'll only say this once. I love my kids.

13:22.768 --> 13:25.134
But I will never, ever give up my tuna.

13:29.775 --> 13:30.935
Later.

13:36.215 --> 13:38.342
<i>Welcome back to Tool Time</i>

13:38.417 --> 13:42.148
and our entertaining look
at fiberglass and its resin.

13:42.221 --> 13:44.451
While we're waiting
for our resin to dry,

13:44.523 --> 13:47.356
why don't we go
to our question and answer section?

13:56.702 --> 13:58.567
All right, who has a question?

13:58.637 --> 14:01.572
- Yes, sir?
- Has your swimsuit calendar come out?

14:01.640 --> 14:04.302
<i>It just went on sale
in the Tool Time gift shop.</i>

14:05.277 --> 14:07.438
Can we wait till after the show, fellas?

14:07.513 --> 14:09.743
- Aw!
- Yes?

14:09.815 --> 14:13.979
I just put up a fence. What's the best
way to keep the wood from rotting?

14:14.954 --> 14:18.981
Well, you want to use a sealant that
contains copper-8-quinolinolate.

14:19.925 --> 14:21.950
Easy to use, fun to say.

14:23.529 --> 14:25.156
- Next question.
- I do.

14:25.231 --> 14:27.756
- Yes?
- I'm re-doing my kitchen countertops.

14:27.833 --> 14:30.199
Can I lay the new laminate
right over the old?

14:30.302 --> 14:34.136
You can, as long as you prepare
the surface and the countertop is flat.

14:34.206 --> 14:37.642
Or if it has a square backsplash,
just like Al.

14:38.878 --> 14:41.210
- Anyone else?
- I have another question.

14:41.280 --> 14:45.239
What do you say about Binford being
one of the worst polluters in Detroit?

14:46.185 --> 14:49.211
- Where did you hear that?
- My kid brought home an article

14:49.288 --> 14:52.587
- from the school paper.
- I can assure you that Binford Tools

14:52.658 --> 14:55.422
is an environmentally
responsible corporation.

14:55.527 --> 14:59.088
- Next question.
- Come clean, you bearded phony.

14:59.198 --> 15:01.063
Bearded phony?

15:01.133 --> 15:04.967
Wexlo Industries, which is located
just downriver from Binford,

15:05.037 --> 15:07.096
didn't have to buy pollution credits.

15:07.172 --> 15:10.801
They reduced their emissions
and didn't cut one single job.

15:12.711 --> 15:16.147
- I just don't have the facts.
- Then, read the article.

15:16.215 --> 15:19.707
<i>The facts are all right here,
in the Lakeside High Reporter.</i>

15:19.785 --> 15:23.687
This is where you're getting your
information, a high school newspaper?

15:23.756 --> 15:25.656
It's time to get back to our project.

15:25.724 --> 15:29.216
- How about answering the man?
- Yeah! Yeah!

15:29.295 --> 15:31.388
How come every time I drive by the plant

15:31.463 --> 15:33.795
all that smoke
is coming out of the stacks?

15:36.335 --> 15:38.064
They're smokestacks!

15:40.539 --> 15:43.440
What do you expect coming out of there?
Whipped cream?

15:43.509 --> 15:44.999
What do you want, huh?

15:45.644 --> 15:49.102
- I think they're both in on it.
- Absolutely! Yeah!

15:49.181 --> 15:51.445
- This is a witch hunt.
- We want the truth!

15:51.517 --> 15:53.985
- And we want it now!
- Yeah!

15:54.053 --> 15:55.987
You are out of order.

15:56.055 --> 15:59.422
And you are out of order!
This whole audience is out of order!

15:59.525 --> 16:01.789
You're nothir but a big flannel fraud!

16:01.860 --> 16:03.327
Yeah!

16:04.496 --> 16:07.795
We'll be right back after these messages
from Binford Tools.

16:10.002 --> 16:12.971
All right, that's it! Show's over!
Everybody get out!

16:22.848 --> 16:25.009
Wilson.

16:26.885 --> 16:29.046
Wilson...

16:30.322 --> 16:32.620
Wilson! What are you doing?

16:33.525 --> 16:36.085
Well, I was in a state
of transcendental bliss.

16:37.162 --> 16:40.495
I'd like you to return
to the state of Michigan, if you could.

16:40.566 --> 16:43.933
<i>I want to talk about this article
in the Lakeside High Reporter.</i>

16:44.036 --> 16:45.196
I haven't read it yet.

16:45.304 --> 16:48.432
<i>I'm still working on
the New York Times and Calcutta Courier.</i>

16:48.507 --> 16:51.203
I don't get to the high school papers
until midnight.

16:51.276 --> 16:55.713
Randy wrote an article in there exposing
Binford's poor environmental record.

16:55.781 --> 16:58.249
I'm real angry about it.

16:58.317 --> 17:00.751
Are you angry
because Randy wrote the article

17:00.819 --> 17:02.719
or because of Binford's poor record?

17:03.589 --> 17:05.215
Both.

17:05.290 --> 17:08.054
Not to mention the fact
that he called me a sell-out.

17:08.127 --> 17:10.492
<i>The information
caused a riot on Tool Time.</i>

17:12.297 --> 17:14.458
- I don't know what to believe.
- Mm-hmm.

17:15.733 --> 17:19.693
I'm reminded of something the Polish
linguist Alfred Korzybski once said.

17:19.771 --> 17:22.002
"Why can't my name be Johnson?"

17:24.810 --> 17:28.974
Korzybski said, "There are two ways to
slide easily through life:

17:29.048 --> 17:31.744
To believe everything
or to doubt everything".

17:31.817 --> 17:33.580
Both ways save you from thinking.

17:35.154 --> 17:37.418
Randy was thinking, I'll give him that.

17:37.489 --> 17:39.354
He sure was passionate.

17:39.425 --> 17:41.552
But the way he presented it was...

17:41.627 --> 17:42.753
...obnoxious.

17:42.828 --> 17:46.559
Tim, when you were Randy's age
didn't you have some burning cause

17:46.632 --> 17:48.497
that you were passionate about?

17:49.968 --> 17:51.299
Auto shop.

17:52.438 --> 17:56.169
They tried to eliminate it from
my school and I fought to keep it there.

17:56.241 --> 17:57.970
Everybody thought I was crazy.

17:58.043 --> 17:59.567
I just fought harder.

17:59.645 --> 18:01.772
Did it cause you to act
in an obnoxious way?

18:01.847 --> 18:03.474
Uh-uh.

18:03.549 --> 18:07.679
Not unless you consider hot gluing
the principal's door shut obnoxious.

18:08.687 --> 18:11.520
Especially if the principal
was inside the office.

18:11.590 --> 18:15.356
And he was.

18:15.427 --> 18:17.895
See, now, Randy would love
to hear that story.

18:17.963 --> 18:22.195
No, I don't talk to him about shop.
He doesn't get into that sort of thing.

18:22.267 --> 18:24.428
But he does get into passionate things.

18:24.503 --> 18:26.061
Oh, yeah, he does.

18:27.339 --> 18:29.273
Gets that from his old man.

18:31.743 --> 18:33.506
Maybe he would like that story.

18:33.579 --> 18:35.308
Maybe he would.

18:36.215 --> 18:37.443
Thanks, Wilson.

18:37.516 --> 18:40.485
You can go back
to your "transcen-dental floss" thing.

18:43.188 --> 18:44.553
Hi, Randy.

18:44.656 --> 18:45.816
Hi, Dad.

18:45.891 --> 18:48.018
Wait a minute.
I want to tell you a story.

18:48.093 --> 18:51.256
- About what?
- A young boy and his goat.

18:54.433 --> 18:56.298
That's more than I want to know.

18:56.368 --> 18:57.596
No, wait.

18:59.938 --> 19:02.236
The goat I'm talking about
is a Pontiac GTO

19:02.307 --> 19:04.036
that I rebuilt in high school.

19:04.109 --> 19:06.737
I couldn't have rebuilt it
without a shop class.

19:06.812 --> 19:10.373
I wouldn't have had a shop class
unless I was willing to fight for it.

19:10.482 --> 19:12.848
That was the endangered species
you saved?

19:12.951 --> 19:14.646
Well, it was almost extinct.

19:14.720 --> 19:19.089
But I felt passionately that kids should
have a place to work with their hands.

19:19.191 --> 19:20.681
The school didn't want that?

19:20.759 --> 19:25.025
It was a budget thing. But they werert
gonna touch the music department.

19:25.097 --> 19:27.463
I didn't relate
to bass bassoons and oboes.

19:27.533 --> 19:31.196
I went to the principal and said,
"This will be handy. Get a flat tire,

19:31.270 --> 19:34.933
can't use a jack, maybe you can
pump the car with a glockenspiel".

19:39.144 --> 19:42.113
- Bit over the top, Dad.
- Exactly, it was over the top.

19:42.181 --> 19:43.512
The way I put it,

19:43.582 --> 19:47.313
a lot of people thought I just wanted
to destroy the music department.

19:47.386 --> 19:49.946
All I really wanted to do
was save the shop class.

19:51.123 --> 19:53.148
My passion got in the way
of my vision.

19:54.593 --> 19:56.857
Dad, I never wanted to destroy Binford.

19:57.696 --> 20:00.062
I know, but it came off like that.

20:00.132 --> 20:02.862
I just got a little too intense.

20:02.935 --> 20:05.267
You were like Jimmy Olsers evil twin.

20:08.240 --> 20:11.732
And I definitely crossed a line
calling you a sell-out.

20:12.444 --> 20:13.570
Thanks.

20:13.645 --> 20:17.137
Maybe next time you meet
with Binford, it'll go better.

20:17.216 --> 20:18.444
Next time?

20:18.517 --> 20:22.476
Look, if Binford's acted irresponsibly,
Bud is the one to talk to.

20:22.554 --> 20:25.717
And no matter, you're a reporter.
You've got to tell the truth.

20:25.824 --> 20:28.987
Right. So, you're totally cool
with me writing a new article?

20:29.061 --> 20:32.428
Yes. I'm not getting in the way
of your Fourth Amendment rights.

20:36.134 --> 20:40.571
That's good, 'cause nothing sticks in
my craw like illegal search and seizure.

20:47.246 --> 20:49.305
Hello. I'm Jill Taylor.

20:49.381 --> 20:51.110
I'm your counseling intern.

20:51.183 --> 20:53.048
Would you like to sit down?

20:54.152 --> 20:56.120
I've been looking over your case file

20:56.221 --> 20:59.884
and I see that you're having trouble
communicating with your son?

21:00.492 --> 21:02.187
Where is he?

21:08.400 --> 21:12.962
You know, I think I'll be referring
your case to another counselor.

21:13.038 --> 21:14.403
'Sup?

21:16.308 --> 21:17.673
Later.

21:24.650 --> 21:28.211
I am an avid proponent

21:28.320 --> 21:30.288
of emotionally focused

21:33.625 --> 21:36.856
You've got to say,"Binford has
an environmental problem?"

21:36.928 --> 21:39.362
I thought you said that after.
Oh, OK.

21:39.431 --> 21:41.365
Get Pat some cheese!

21:42.768 --> 21:43.860
OK!

21:48.040 --> 21:49.769
That'll help. This helps.

21:52.177 --> 21:53.337
Hold on a minute.

21:53.412 --> 21:56.472
The goat I'm talking to
is a Pontiac GT...
