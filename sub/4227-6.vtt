<i>Falling Skies...</i>

00:02.866 --> 00:04.971
Oppression is in your nature.

00:04.997 --> 00:07.970
And <i>that</i> is your justification
for the murder of billions?

00:08.717 --> 00:10.730
What the hell
happened here?

00:10.755 --> 00:12.864
So these bastards
are shooting each other now?

00:14.156 --> 00:15.302
Maggie...

00:15.327 --> 00:16.641
Don't.

00:17.262 --> 00:18.660
In the harnessing
facility...

00:18.685 --> 00:20.413
I saw your spikes glow.

00:20.438 --> 00:21.936
You can rat me out
if you want,

00:21.961 --> 00:24.585
but I am not signing
my own death warrant.

00:24.610 --> 00:26.305
I hope you're not afraid.

00:26.330 --> 00:28.294
Whatever you think
they've done to me,

00:28.319 --> 00:29.444
I'm still Karen.

00:43.931 --> 00:45.630
Hey, sleepyhead.

00:45.665 --> 00:47.665
Hey.

00:47.699 --> 00:48.799
Morning already?

00:48.834 --> 00:52.068
Yep.
Time to go to work.

00:52.102 --> 00:55.071
You know Weaver
and his schedules.

00:55.106 --> 00:57.940
"Tom, we're gonna have meetings

00:57.975 --> 01:00.075
"every morning at 9:00.

01:00.110 --> 01:02.811
"Rain or shine,
come hell or high water,

01:02.845 --> 01:06.947
"come Skitters or Mechs
dancing in the mess hall.

01:06.982 --> 01:08.749
"And, Tom...

01:08.784 --> 01:11.086
I can't abide
any tardiness."

01:11.120 --> 01:12.987
We've been here two weeks,

01:13.022 --> 01:15.657
and already
everything feels so...

01:15.691 --> 01:18.426
Normal?

01:18.460 --> 01:20.828
Normal like the way
it was before?

01:20.862 --> 01:24.965
That's too hard
to imagine.

01:24.999 --> 01:27.534
Although I do miss
some things.

01:27.601 --> 01:29.937
Like what?

01:29.971 --> 01:34.941
Taking a deep breath of clean,
crisp, New England air.

01:34.975 --> 01:36.809
Hmm.

01:36.843 --> 01:39.946
Oh, and the smell
of coffee brewing.

01:39.980 --> 01:42.681
And?

01:42.715 --> 01:44.949
The sound of my boys
waking up,

01:44.984 --> 01:48.219
fighting over who gets
the bathroom.

01:48.254 --> 01:50.221
Those three...

01:50.255 --> 01:54.225
constantly, always on each other
about the stupidest stuff,

01:54.260 --> 01:57.562
like TV or socks or...

01:57.597 --> 01:58.864
Cereal.

01:58.898 --> 02:01.866
Rebecca constantly
having to be the...

02:01.901 --> 02:05.637
referee.

02:05.671 --> 02:07.072
Sorry.

02:07.140 --> 02:10.241
Nothing
to be sorry about.

02:10.276 --> 02:13.713
I had a husband, too.
And a son.

02:13.747 --> 02:16.616
I miss them --
sometimes very much.

02:19.720 --> 02:21.487
But this is
what we have now.

02:21.522 --> 02:22.789
I know.

02:25.059 --> 02:27.728
And it feels nice.

02:27.762 --> 02:31.165
Yeah, it feels nice.

02:31.199 --> 02:32.633
It feels really nice.

02:32.668 --> 02:33.768
Mm.

02:33.802 --> 02:35.036
But I'm gonna be late.

02:35.070 --> 02:36.203
Me too.

02:36.238 --> 02:37.905
So, can we
pick this up later?

02:37.939 --> 02:39.907
Mm. We have to.

02:39.942 --> 02:41.042
After dinner?

02:41.076 --> 02:42.609
Mm. Or after lunch?

02:42.677 --> 02:45.179
Oh, that sounds
even better.

02:45.213 --> 02:48.516
It's a date.

02:52.153 --> 02:56.090
Hi. Sorry.

02:56.124 --> 02:58.592
That's twice
this week, Tom.

02:58.626 --> 03:01.094
Yes, sir.

03:01.129 --> 03:02.929
Well, that just underlines
the main point of the discussion

03:02.964 --> 03:06.733
that we're going to have
this morning.

03:06.767 --> 03:09.870
Fact is,
this whole company...

03:09.904 --> 03:13.740
become too relaxed,
too complacent.

03:13.774 --> 03:15.275
I can see it already

03:15.309 --> 03:18.612
in the neglected chores
and the sloppy drilling,

03:18.646 --> 03:19.813
the tardiness.

03:19.847 --> 03:22.081
Captain,
with all due respect,

03:22.116 --> 03:24.684
2nd Mass has been through quite
a lot these last few months.

03:24.718 --> 03:26.119
A little R&R
can't be a bad thing.

03:26.153 --> 03:29.122
I disagree, Tom.
It can be the death of us.

03:29.156 --> 03:31.057
We cannot afford
to let our guard down

03:31.091 --> 03:32.158
for even one single day.

03:32.226 --> 03:34.060
Now, this whole reason,

03:34.095 --> 03:37.330
the point we stopped here
was to restock and prep

03:37.364 --> 03:41.334
for the long haul...
haul to Charleston.

03:44.938 --> 03:46.806
Captain?

03:46.840 --> 03:48.941
Hold on. I'm fine.
Gonna be all right?

03:48.975 --> 03:50.309
Just push the...

03:59.285 --> 04:00.986
Captain Weaver?!

04:01.020 --> 04:03.689
What's happening?
What's happening?

04:03.756 --> 04:05.624
Oh, my gosh.

04:07.761 --> 04:10.696
Somebody go get Dr. Glass
right now!

04:10.764 --> 04:11.831
Dr. Glass!

04:11.865 --> 04:13.232
What have
they done to me?

04:13.266 --> 04:17.070
What have those damn aliens
done to me, Tom?

04:18.839 --> 04:21.942
Hold him!
Hold him steady!

04:21.976 --> 04:23.598
Captain?!

04:34.857 --> 04:36.724
Tom?
Yeah.

04:36.759 --> 04:39.360
I gave him a monster dose
of Lorazepam -- no effect.

04:39.395 --> 04:40.862
Ohh.

04:40.896 --> 04:44.132
I need you...
to take over.

04:44.166 --> 04:46.134
You hear me?
You're gonna be fine.

04:46.168 --> 04:48.002
Listen!

04:48.037 --> 04:49.704
Don't worry about me.

04:49.738 --> 04:52.040
You just get the 2nd Mass
to Charleston.

04:52.074 --> 04:53.741
I'm counting on you.

04:53.776 --> 04:56.177
I don't understand.
How did this happen?

04:56.212 --> 04:58.647
This.

04:58.681 --> 05:00.015
I tried every antibiotic

05:00.049 --> 05:01.683
and every antiviral medication
we have here --

05:01.717 --> 05:03.051
no effect at all.
What is that?

05:03.086 --> 05:04.753
Is that venom
from the harness spike?

05:04.821 --> 05:07.056
Probably, but every test we've
given him turned out negative.

05:07.090 --> 05:08.891
No signs of anything
out of the ordinary.

05:08.925 --> 05:10.659
<i>That</i> looks
pretty out of the ordinary.

05:10.694 --> 05:12.261
If there's something there,

05:12.295 --> 05:13.930
it's too small for us to see
with the equipment we have here.

05:13.997 --> 05:16.866
I've been trying to keep the
spread localized to his legs.

05:16.900 --> 05:18.234
Wait a second.

05:18.268 --> 05:19.936
You mean this has been
spreading for a while?

05:19.970 --> 05:21.671
Yes --
why didn't you tell me?

05:21.705 --> 05:22.772
Believe me, I wanted to,

05:22.806 --> 05:24.173
but Captain Weaver
was clear --

05:24.208 --> 05:26.009
he didn't want anyone to know --
especially you.

05:26.043 --> 05:27.277
Especially me?

05:27.311 --> 05:28.812
We could have done
something sooner.

05:28.846 --> 05:30.914
Like what?
Like getting him to Charleston,

05:30.948 --> 05:32.282
where maybe they have
a doctor

05:32.316 --> 05:33.717
that knows
what to do about it.

05:33.751 --> 05:34.851
What I know is
this poison,

05:34.886 --> 05:36.887
or whatever it is,
is spreading.

05:36.921 --> 05:38.355
So, that's all the more reason
to get him to Charleston, then.

05:38.389 --> 05:40.090
Tom --
listen. So do what you can for him.

05:40.124 --> 05:41.358
Stabilize him,
prep the med bus.

05:41.393 --> 05:43.360
We're leaving tonight.

05:46.098 --> 05:47.765
Just for the record,

05:47.800 --> 05:50.968
I think it's crazy you're out
here on patrol already.

05:51.003 --> 05:52.370
How many times
do I have to remind you

05:52.404 --> 05:53.972
how much
I hate hospitals?

05:54.006 --> 05:55.373
You're risking pulling out
your stitches,

05:55.407 --> 05:58.109
possible infection,
maybe getting shot again,

05:58.143 --> 05:59.377
just to be out here
with me.

05:59.411 --> 06:02.246
You know what that means?
You like me.

06:02.280 --> 06:06.083
Typical guy --
making it all about you.

06:06.118 --> 06:07.451
You know what I mean.

06:07.486 --> 06:09.453
I do.

06:09.488 --> 06:12.823
Hal, we're gonna have to talk
about some things.

06:12.890 --> 06:15.125
Oh, not this again.
Yes, this again.

06:15.159 --> 06:17.861
Look,
I get what you're saying.

06:17.895 --> 06:20.096
No,
I don't think you do.

06:20.131 --> 06:23.800
Hal, I'm...
Not the right person for you.

06:23.834 --> 06:26.235
Don't I get to decide that?

06:26.270 --> 06:28.137
What is it about
"I want to be with you"

06:28.171 --> 06:29.472
that you don't
understand?

06:29.506 --> 06:30.806
All of it.

06:30.841 --> 06:32.742
Which is why
I'm trying to say

06:32.776 --> 06:34.844
<i>nothing</i> can happen
between us.

06:34.912 --> 06:37.413
Okay. 'Cause you don't like me.
I get it.

06:37.447 --> 06:39.282
No.

06:39.316 --> 06:41.751
No, the truth is I asked Weaver
to move me to another unit.

06:41.785 --> 06:44.120
Oh, what? Whose?
Goodman's.

06:44.155 --> 06:45.355
Goodman?

06:45.423 --> 06:46.957
Yeah. Goodman.

06:46.991 --> 06:49.092
Isn't he's like 50?

06:49.127 --> 06:50.761
Hal...

06:50.795 --> 06:52.329
- Hey, no, I'm just asking.
- That's --

06:57.769 --> 06:59.937
God!

07:01.472 --> 07:04.341
He had his harness removed.

07:06.344 --> 07:07.778
Oh, God.

07:07.812 --> 07:10.147
Hal...there's more.

07:15.820 --> 07:18.088
Oh, my God.

07:23.361 --> 07:25.329
They're all dead.

07:25.363 --> 07:26.897
We got to be sure.

07:30.035 --> 07:31.502
Ohh.

07:35.373 --> 07:37.508
Hal!
Yeah.

07:41.046 --> 07:44.181
Karen!

07:44.215 --> 07:47.452
Karen.

07:47.486 --> 07:49.020
I don't understand.

07:49.054 --> 07:52.324
Help me!

07:52.358 --> 07:54.059
Karen.

07:54.093 --> 07:56.394
Karen!

07:56.429 --> 07:58.830
Karen!

07:58.865 --> 08:00.299
Karen!

08:06.976 --> 08:09.044
I'm not gonna sugarcoat
the situation.

08:09.079 --> 08:11.480
Captain Weaver is
in serious medical trouble.

08:11.515 --> 08:14.016
Dr. Glass is doing
everything possible,

08:14.051 --> 08:16.352
but so far nothing
seems to be working.

08:16.387 --> 08:19.155
I believe we have no choice
but to get back on the road

08:19.189 --> 08:20.857
and get to Charleston.

08:20.924 --> 08:23.026
I think that's not only
Captain Weaver's best chance

08:23.060 --> 08:24.861
but ours, as well.

08:24.895 --> 08:28.564
Like when?
We should be ready to leave by tonight.

08:28.598 --> 08:31.333
Uh, well -- well, that --
that might be a problem.

08:31.368 --> 08:33.568
Okay.

08:33.602 --> 08:35.236
Well,
on Captain Weaver's orders,

08:35.272 --> 08:37.438
I've been draining the fuel
from the vehicles

08:37.474 --> 08:40.509
that run on diesel to keep
the hospital generator going.

08:40.543 --> 08:43.312
We don't have enough fuel
to get to Charleston.

08:43.346 --> 08:45.314
We barely had enough
to get here from Richmond.

08:45.348 --> 08:47.316
Captain Weaver
knew about this?

08:47.351 --> 08:49.585
We've been trying to scout
fuel depots for weeks,

08:49.620 --> 08:50.987
but haven't had any luck.

08:51.021 --> 08:52.355
Yeah,
which is why the captain

08:52.390 --> 08:55.592
had me using the diesel
for the generator.

08:55.626 --> 08:57.294
We have
a bigger problem.

08:57.328 --> 08:59.029
I've already drained the diesel
from the trucks,

08:59.063 --> 09:02.032
and, well,
we only have enough fuel

09:02.066 --> 09:06.870
to keep the generators going
for another 12 hours max.

09:06.905 --> 09:09.206
And when were you gonna give
Captain Weaver <i>that</i> news?

09:09.241 --> 09:13.478
He --
he knew...everything.

09:21.152 --> 09:24.254
All right.

09:24.289 --> 09:26.457
Obviously, the first
order of business, then,

09:26.491 --> 09:28.225
is to widen the search
for fuel.

09:28.260 --> 09:30.494
Dai, assign
three scouting parties --

09:30.562 --> 09:33.932
one to the east, one to the
south, and one to the west.

09:33.966 --> 09:36.001
Give them enough fuel
for four hours out

09:36.035 --> 09:37.435
and four hours back.

09:37.469 --> 09:39.003
Jamil, if we shut down
all the power

09:39.037 --> 09:40.438
except to the ICU
where Dr. Glass is working,

09:40.472 --> 09:42.273
how much more time will that
give us on the generator?

09:42.307 --> 09:44.676
I'm guessing
roughly double.

09:44.710 --> 09:46.444
Okay. Good.
Let's do that.

09:46.478 --> 09:47.645
Okay.

09:47.679 --> 09:49.113
And the rest of us,
we got to get packed

09:49.148 --> 09:50.148
and we got to get loaded
for Charleston.

09:50.182 --> 09:51.182
There's no time to lose.

09:52.484 --> 09:54.018
Dad!

09:54.086 --> 09:55.353
Yep.

09:55.421 --> 09:57.021
Hal and Maggie
just got back from patrol.

09:57.089 --> 09:58.422
They need you
right away.

09:58.457 --> 10:00.591
Okay. I'll be there in a bit.
But, dad --

10:00.626 --> 10:03.194
they found Karen --
in the woods.

10:08.700 --> 10:10.668
Hey!

10:10.702 --> 10:12.436
We found her buried
in the woods --

10:12.471 --> 10:14.538
along with a group
of de-harnessed kids,

10:14.605 --> 10:16.436
all dead, except her.

10:16.471 --> 10:18.669
I don't understand.
She's barely breathing.

10:18.703 --> 10:20.370
We got to get her
to Dr. Glass.

10:20.438 --> 10:21.638
Okay.
Wait, wait, wait.

10:21.672 --> 10:23.006
Dad! Her harness is gone!
Please.

10:23.040 --> 10:25.541
Don't let her stay.

10:25.609 --> 10:28.176
We can't trust her.
She's still attached to them.

10:28.211 --> 10:31.211
How do you know that,
Ben?

10:31.246 --> 10:34.381
I can --
I can hear it.

10:38.252 --> 10:40.353
All right, Dai, you and Lyle
take her to the psych ward,

10:40.387 --> 10:41.487
put her in a secure room.

10:41.521 --> 10:43.088
Dad...

10:43.122 --> 10:45.357
Your dad's right.
It's best this way.

10:45.391 --> 10:47.092
Until we know.

10:47.126 --> 10:49.528
Dr. Glass is in the ICU
with Captain Weaver.

10:49.562 --> 10:51.730
Ask her to meet us
in the psych ward.

11:06.144 --> 11:08.711
It's okay.
It's okay.

11:08.745 --> 11:10.312
Where am I?
You're here with the 2nd Mass.

11:10.346 --> 11:12.047
Look at me.
It's Dr. Glass.

11:12.081 --> 11:13.214
Remember me?
Don't talk to her.

11:13.249 --> 11:14.249
I told you
we can't trust her.

11:14.283 --> 11:16.050
Ben.

11:16.085 --> 11:18.353
She's not one of us.
It's all right, Ben.

11:18.388 --> 11:19.988
Hello, Karen.

11:23.425 --> 11:25.992
Oh, you're alive.

11:26.027 --> 11:27.127
Oh, thank God.

11:27.161 --> 11:30.030
As you can see.

11:30.064 --> 11:34.300
It was the most
horrible thing...

11:34.334 --> 11:37.336
I have ever experienced...

11:39.373 --> 11:41.607
...watching them
torture you...

11:41.641 --> 11:47.313
not being
able to do anything.

11:49.049 --> 11:51.417
We're glad you're back,
Karen.

11:51.452 --> 11:54.120
We do have some questions,
though.

11:54.154 --> 11:55.521
And a few concerns.

11:55.556 --> 11:58.091
Sure.

11:58.125 --> 12:01.094
The ones you were found with --
the dead kids --

12:01.128 --> 12:03.262
were they on the ship
with you?

12:03.297 --> 12:06.532
Maybe, but I...

12:06.566 --> 12:08.434
I don't remember.

12:08.468 --> 12:10.302
What <i>do</i> you remember?

12:10.336 --> 12:14.039
Only that I was...

12:14.073 --> 12:16.574
on the ship...

12:16.609 --> 12:18.743
in my pod.

12:20.713 --> 12:23.715
When I woke up,
I saw Hal's face.

12:27.153 --> 12:29.154
That's all.

12:29.189 --> 12:33.158
Look, I understand how crazy
this might sound, but...

12:33.193 --> 12:34.726
How was
your harness removed?

12:34.761 --> 12:36.661
I'm not sure...

12:36.696 --> 12:39.398
but I can
only guess that...

12:39.432 --> 12:40.699
What?

12:42.401 --> 12:46.404
That I had served
my purpose.

12:48.440 --> 12:51.142
All right,
well, get some rest.

12:51.176 --> 12:52.677
Try to get
your strength back.

12:52.711 --> 12:56.581
I'm sure Dr. Glass
is gonna want to run some tests.

12:56.616 --> 12:59.684
Can I get some food?

12:59.752 --> 13:02.587
I don't think I've eaten
anything in a really long time.

13:02.621 --> 13:05.457
I promise, you'll be
very well taken care of.

13:05.491 --> 13:08.760
All I ask of you is that
you don't leave this room,

13:08.794 --> 13:10.762
until we've had
a chance...

13:10.796 --> 13:12.197
To make sure
that I'm not a threat.

13:12.231 --> 13:14.165
Make sure that
you're healthy.

13:14.200 --> 13:18.170
Yeah.
I understand.

13:18.204 --> 13:21.840
And I'm really happy
to be home.

13:21.875 --> 13:27.445
All I ever wanted was to be back
to the 2nd Mass...

13:27.480 --> 13:29.581
with you and Hal.

13:31.785 --> 13:34.186
Get some rest.
We'll talk more later.

13:34.220 --> 13:35.721
Hal?

13:35.789 --> 13:38.124
I want a guard
on that door, 24/7.

13:38.158 --> 13:40.159
Glad you're back.

13:47.167 --> 13:48.667
Dad...

13:48.702 --> 13:50.536
I want to stay
with her.

13:50.570 --> 13:51.871
I don't know that
that's such a --

13:51.905 --> 13:53.672
I have a better chance
than anybody else

13:53.707 --> 13:55.541
of finding something
that's not right.

13:55.576 --> 13:57.410
All right. Fine.

13:57.444 --> 13:59.846
I still want a guard
on that door.

14:04.652 --> 14:06.519
Hey, Ben.

14:08.656 --> 14:09.890
So, what's going on?

14:09.924 --> 14:11.358
What do you mean?

14:11.393 --> 14:12.660
I mean
all the suspicion.

14:12.694 --> 14:14.395
All the crap about
those bad feelings,

14:14.430 --> 14:15.398
whatever that is.

14:15.432 --> 14:16.834
That's Karen.

14:16.868 --> 14:18.705
So you say.

14:18.739 --> 14:20.407
I never met her before today,
remember?

14:20.441 --> 14:22.175
Because we lost her

14:22.209 --> 14:25.712
while she was helping
trying to rescue you.

14:25.746 --> 14:27.714
I'm sure whoever
she was before,

14:27.748 --> 14:29.683
she was
a wonderful person.

14:29.717 --> 14:32.586
But that thing in there --
that's not Karen.

14:32.621 --> 14:35.623
So why are you
any different, then, huh?

14:37.759 --> 14:38.926
Because I'm not.

14:38.960 --> 14:40.861
Which is exactly why
I can handle her.

14:40.895 --> 14:43.597
You won't be able to resist
her manipulating you.

14:43.631 --> 14:45.598
Would you listen
to yourself, bro?

14:45.633 --> 14:46.866
Look at her.

14:46.901 --> 14:48.268
She was half-dead
when we found her.

14:48.302 --> 14:50.236
She's scared,
and she's freaked out.

14:50.271 --> 14:52.505
How's she
gonna manipulate me?

14:52.539 --> 14:54.774
She's already started.

14:54.808 --> 14:56.309
If I were you,

14:56.376 --> 14:58.478
I'd keep him as far away
from her as possible.

14:58.545 --> 14:59.912
Won't end well.

14:59.947 --> 15:01.647
God, you can be such a --

15:01.682 --> 15:03.783
Freak?

15:03.817 --> 15:05.451
I was gonna say "tool."

15:05.486 --> 15:07.821
But if you like "freak,"
sure, we'll stick with that.

15:10.257 --> 15:11.892
Boy, he can be frustrating.

15:11.926 --> 15:14.461
Yeah,
but probably right.

15:14.495 --> 15:17.464
Really? Come on, now --
Slow down.

15:17.498 --> 15:19.900
I'm just saying
it's a little more than weird

15:19.934 --> 15:21.969
that she just happens
to show up

15:22.003 --> 15:24.406
less than a klick
from the hospital.

15:24.440 --> 15:27.409
Yeah. Okay. So?

15:27.443 --> 15:30.412
So you haven't
even flinched.

15:30.447 --> 15:33.282
The Hal Mason I know
would have been all over that

15:33.317 --> 15:36.685
if it had been anyone
other than your old girlfriend.

15:40.523 --> 15:41.957
Okay.

15:55.838 --> 15:57.806
It's getting
exponentially worse.

15:57.840 --> 15:59.941
Meaning what?

15:59.975 --> 16:03.010
He has less time than I thought,
than I can even estimate.

16:07.650 --> 16:09.618
Damn it.

16:09.652 --> 16:11.619
Thoughts?

16:11.654 --> 16:14.289
Well, the equipment here
isn't that sophisticated,

16:14.323 --> 16:15.690
but what I think
is happening

16:15.724 --> 16:17.692
is that somehow the toxin
from the harness

16:17.726 --> 16:19.794
has attached itself
onto the erythrocytes --

16:19.829 --> 16:21.396
the red cells --

16:21.464 --> 16:23.431
like a parasite hitching
a ride up his bloodstream.

16:23.465 --> 16:24.865
But he got bitten
weeks ago.

16:24.900 --> 16:26.867
Wouldn't that have
killed him already?

16:26.902 --> 16:28.836
It should have, yes,
but my theory --

16:28.870 --> 16:30.437
and it's just a theory --

16:30.472 --> 16:31.872
is that this toxin or parasite
or whatever it is,

16:31.906 --> 16:33.574
needed time to incubate,
to mature.

16:33.608 --> 16:35.976
Like eggs?

16:36.011 --> 16:38.979
Or larvae or...
something I don't understand.

16:39.014 --> 16:41.649
So that's it?
We're just gonna watch him die?

16:41.683 --> 16:42.750
No, of course not.

16:42.818 --> 16:44.051
All right.
Get Weaver ready.

16:44.086 --> 16:45.620
We're gonna get
whatever gas we have,

16:45.654 --> 16:47.055
put him in the fastest vehicle
we've got.

16:47.089 --> 16:47.989
We're just gonna drive him
straight to Charleston.

16:48.023 --> 16:50.324
No!
That's an order.

16:50.358 --> 16:52.526
You don't get to give me orders.
No?

16:52.560 --> 16:54.728
I'm in charge
of the 2nd Mass now.

16:54.762 --> 16:55.862
And I've been taking care
of the 2nd Mass

16:55.897 --> 16:56.997
since the beginning.

16:57.031 --> 16:58.399
I'm the doctor here.

16:58.433 --> 17:00.067
I know that!
Not you, not anyone!

17:00.101 --> 17:02.869
I decide the course of action for
my patients -- me and me alone!

17:02.904 --> 17:03.744
Listen. Calm down. Stop, stop, stop.

17:03.769 --> 17:04.938
And Captain Weaver's best chance
is here with me!

17:04.939 --> 17:06.606
Rebecca, stop!

17:10.578 --> 17:14.414
I'm sorry.

17:16.450 --> 17:18.584
I'm surprised it hasn't happened
sooner, to be honest.

17:18.618 --> 17:21.453
Or vice versa.

17:23.423 --> 17:26.058
I'm not your wife, Tom.

17:26.092 --> 17:28.393
And we don't get the luxury
of having a lover's spat

17:28.426 --> 17:30.028
in this stupid wasteland
of a world.

17:30.062 --> 17:31.629
All we get to do
is survive.

17:31.663 --> 17:33.431
Listen, I've had his job
for less than a day,

17:33.465 --> 17:34.965
and I don't think
any of us have realized

17:35.000 --> 17:36.868
how much he's held
the 2nd Mass together with...

17:36.902 --> 17:40.605
spit and glue
and sheer willpower.

17:40.639 --> 17:44.909
Our best chance of survival
is his survival.

17:47.914 --> 17:50.549
Give me until midnight
to come up with something.

17:50.583 --> 17:52.651
If I can't,
then we'll do it your way.

17:52.685 --> 17:54.820
All right,
fair enough.

18:09.087 --> 18:13.057
It's good to finally
meet you, Ben.

18:13.091 --> 18:15.459
Hal used to talk
about you a lot.

18:15.493 --> 18:18.929
I had forgotten
what real food tastes like.

18:21.232 --> 18:23.066
Is that Pope guy
still cooking,

18:23.101 --> 18:25.802
or is Uncle Scott back
in the kitchen?

18:25.837 --> 18:28.272
Pope's gone, and...

18:28.306 --> 18:31.876
Uncle Scott was killed

18:31.910 --> 18:34.878
when Mech bullets
tore him apart

18:34.913 --> 18:36.413
when he was trying to
save a group of kids

18:36.448 --> 18:38.282
pinned down
by a Skitter column.

18:41.453 --> 18:43.320
I'm sorry.

18:46.458 --> 18:48.559
I liked Uncle Scott.

18:48.593 --> 18:52.163
Well, he's dead.

18:52.197 --> 18:56.334
Along with a lot of other
really, really good people.

18:56.368 --> 18:59.070
People who were trying to fight
your masters.

18:59.104 --> 19:01.239
They're not my masters.

19:01.273 --> 19:04.009
Not anymore.

19:05.912 --> 19:08.413
You might be able to
fool the others, but not me.

19:08.448 --> 19:11.583
I can hear you.

19:11.618 --> 19:15.454
You can hear me?

19:15.488 --> 19:17.990
What are you talking about?

19:18.024 --> 19:20.592
You're still connected
to them.

19:20.627 --> 19:22.461
You can hear it, too.

19:24.130 --> 19:26.098
I do hear...

19:26.132 --> 19:29.635
something.

19:29.669 --> 19:31.971
It's kind of like...

19:32.005 --> 19:34.406
a TV and a radio
and static

19:34.441 --> 19:35.875
playing all at once.

19:35.909 --> 19:37.276
Is -- is that what
you're talking about?

19:39.313 --> 19:42.148
Yeah.
Something like that.

19:42.182 --> 19:44.483
But it's just noise.

19:44.518 --> 19:48.087
Distant noise.

19:48.122 --> 19:50.490
I for sure don't
feel connected anymore,

19:50.524 --> 19:52.258
'cause I remember
what that felt like.

19:52.292 --> 19:54.661
You do?

19:54.695 --> 19:56.296
Yeah.

20:01.468 --> 20:04.336
Like a hand
wrapped around my throat...

20:08.474 --> 20:11.043
...moving me around
like I was a rag doll,

20:11.077 --> 20:13.178
hardly able to breathe.

20:13.213 --> 20:18.051
Forced to witness
horrible things...

20:18.085 --> 20:21.487
powerless to speak out.

20:25.192 --> 20:27.193
You must remember.

20:30.097 --> 20:32.198
I remember.

20:32.232 --> 20:35.201
And you were paired
with the Skitters.

20:41.174 --> 20:43.709
Imagine 10 times that.

20:52.753 --> 20:55.355
Can I get
some more bread?

20:56.524 --> 20:59.626
Uh...

20:59.661 --> 21:02.963
Yeah. Um...

21:02.997 --> 21:04.531
Sure.

21:19.580 --> 21:21.514
We think we've come up
with something --

21:21.549 --> 21:22.982
well, Lourdes,
actually.

21:23.017 --> 21:24.751
Uh, well,
it really started

21:24.785 --> 21:27.220
with the Captain
being hypothermic,

21:27.254 --> 21:30.256
which is his body temperature
has been dropping.

21:30.290 --> 21:31.557
Which didn't make
any sense

21:31.592 --> 21:33.360
since the normal reaction
to an infection

21:33.394 --> 21:35.262
is an elevated temperature,
a fever.

21:35.296 --> 21:37.364
But that's not
what's happening here.

21:37.399 --> 21:38.765
So we wondered
if the pathogen

21:38.800 --> 21:40.668
needed a cooler
host environment to survive,

21:40.702 --> 21:43.070
which is why it's moving
through the capillary system

21:43.104 --> 21:44.638
nearest to the surface
of the skin.

21:44.672 --> 21:46.740
So we tried raising Captain
Weaver's core temperature

21:46.775 --> 21:48.375
back up with heaters
and blankets,

21:48.410 --> 21:50.010
and that slowed
the pathogen down,

21:50.045 --> 21:51.312
but didn't stop it.

21:51.346 --> 21:52.446
And that's when
I remembered something

21:52.481 --> 21:54.015
from my immunology class.

21:54.049 --> 21:55.550
A technique called
extracorporeal hyperthermia.

21:55.584 --> 21:57.751
The idea,
as crazy as it sounds,

21:57.786 --> 22:00.454
is we pump out
Captain Weaver's blood,

22:00.489 --> 22:02.523
warm it to over
105 degrees,

22:02.557 --> 22:03.791
then we pump it back
into his body.

22:03.826 --> 22:05.359
That change
in temperature

22:05.394 --> 22:07.128
should at least disrupt
the growth of the pathogen

22:07.195 --> 22:08.362
if not killing it
altogether.

22:08.397 --> 22:10.064
You're right.
That sounds crazy.

22:10.098 --> 22:13.300
The technique has been used
to treat cancer and aids.

22:13.335 --> 22:14.702
Okay, assuming for half a second
that that's even possible,

22:14.736 --> 22:16.170
how do you do that
without killing him?

22:16.204 --> 22:18.572
Well, that's where
Jamil comes in.

22:18.607 --> 22:20.174
Me?

22:20.208 --> 22:22.176
All we need is a way
to pump and recirculate

22:22.210 --> 22:24.178
the captain's blood
through a heating element.

22:24.212 --> 22:26.714
That's all?

22:26.748 --> 22:28.315
Can you do it or not?

22:28.383 --> 22:29.716
Well, listen, I'm not saying
it's not possible,

22:29.751 --> 22:31.585
but when and with what?

22:31.620 --> 22:34.288
The when is now,
and this is a hospital.

22:34.323 --> 22:36.491
I know we can find the
raw materials and machines.

22:41.364 --> 22:43.565
There's no other choice,
is there?

22:45.602 --> 22:47.569
Okay. Do it.
Just do it.

22:47.604 --> 22:49.305
But in the meantime,
we keep prepping for Charleston.

22:49.339 --> 22:51.307
As soon as those scouting
parties get back with fuel,

22:51.341 --> 22:53.609
we're on the road.

22:59.750 --> 23:01.184
Anything?

23:01.218 --> 23:03.586
No fuel, boss!

23:03.621 --> 23:05.322
But we found them
on the side of the road

23:05.356 --> 23:06.590
about 10 miles west
of here.

23:06.624 --> 23:08.359
Them?

23:11.130 --> 23:12.430
Pope.

23:12.464 --> 23:15.200
I don't think he's breathing.

23:18.471 --> 23:21.306
Over here.
Right over here.

23:21.341 --> 23:23.208
This is good, Lyle.

23:26.446 --> 23:27.546
Is he...

23:27.580 --> 23:30.149
Alive? Barely.

23:31.551 --> 23:33.219
Okay, I'm fine.

23:33.286 --> 23:35.521
No, you're not.
Sit down.

23:35.556 --> 23:37.156
What happened?

23:37.190 --> 23:39.258
Me and Pope...

23:39.292 --> 23:42.128
Went looking for a new set
of wheels outside of Durham.

23:42.162 --> 23:44.530
So we split up.
I heard gunfire.

23:44.564 --> 23:46.799
And by the time I got back
to him,

23:46.833 --> 23:49.268
he was being chased
by a mess of Skitters.

23:49.302 --> 23:50.869
We ran like hell...

23:50.903 --> 23:53.338
but a Mech got a shot off
and the blast landed near us.

23:53.373 --> 23:56.475
Pope went down.
And I just picked him up.

23:56.509 --> 23:58.310
And I kept running
until I couldn't run anymore.

23:59.546 --> 24:01.781
He needs to rest now.
Sure. It's good to have you back.

24:01.815 --> 24:02.915
What about him?

24:02.950 --> 24:04.250
He's dehydrated.

24:04.318 --> 24:05.485
Got a pretty good
concussion,

24:05.519 --> 24:06.452
but I don't see
any critical wounds,

24:06.487 --> 24:07.520
which is a good thing.

24:07.554 --> 24:08.854
So,
he's gonna be okay?

24:08.889 --> 24:10.656
We'll give him
some fluids.

24:10.690 --> 24:12.524
If he wakes up in the next few
hours, he should be fine.

24:12.559 --> 24:14.292
Call me when he wakes up, but
I don't have to remind you --

24:14.326 --> 24:16.294
I know.
Weaver's a priority.

24:28.564 --> 24:31.533
My family used to spend summers
on Nantucket.

24:31.568 --> 24:34.904
I don't think
I ever wore shoes.

24:34.938 --> 24:38.174
I loved
the sunlight there.

24:38.208 --> 24:41.878
Warm. Sweet.

24:41.912 --> 24:46.383
Do you ever dream
of what it was like...

24:46.417 --> 24:48.552
before?

24:48.586 --> 24:51.354
Hard to dream
when you don't sleep.

24:51.388 --> 24:53.056
Really?

24:53.090 --> 24:56.326
I don't think I ever slept
as good as I did last night.

24:56.360 --> 24:58.828
Breakfast.

24:58.863 --> 25:00.930
Oh, thank you.

25:00.998 --> 25:04.234
I can't believe how hungry
I am all the time.

25:04.268 --> 25:08.372
Well, it's, uh, not much,
I'm afraid, but...

25:08.406 --> 25:11.842
we're running low on...
everything.

25:11.877 --> 25:14.845
Time for another
food scout, huh?

25:14.880 --> 25:18.248
We're pulling out
soon anyway.

25:18.283 --> 25:21.251
To where?

25:21.286 --> 25:25.056
I don't know.
They don't tell me that.

25:25.090 --> 25:28.926
'Cause
of your spikes?

25:28.961 --> 25:31.329
Guess I'd better get used
to that, too.

25:31.364 --> 25:33.598
Yeah, well, it's...

25:33.633 --> 25:37.402
not so much fun being
called a "razorback"...

25:37.437 --> 25:38.871
or "coat hanger."

25:38.905 --> 25:41.106
Really?

25:41.140 --> 25:42.441
That's what they call us?

25:42.475 --> 25:45.411
Not to my face,
but, uh, yeah.

25:45.445 --> 25:50.083
But it's not all bad...
I'm realizing.

25:50.117 --> 25:53.152
Yeah?

25:53.187 --> 25:54.487
Well,
it's weird, but...

25:54.521 --> 25:58.124
I can hear
almost anything.

25:58.159 --> 25:59.659
Like what?

25:59.693 --> 26:02.495
Like conversations
about the generator

26:02.530 --> 26:04.965
not having enough fuel,

26:04.999 --> 26:06.366
or Captain Weaver
being in a coma.

26:06.400 --> 26:09.102
I mean, I assume you can,
too, right?

26:11.338 --> 26:14.574
Yeah. S-sometimes --
sometimes, yeah.

26:14.608 --> 26:17.243
When I was looking out
the window earlier,

26:17.277 --> 26:20.146
I could see details
I never even knew existed.

26:21.348 --> 26:24.950
And then there's this.

26:27.454 --> 26:31.023
You got to admit
that's kind of cool, right?

26:32.325 --> 26:33.992
Karen,
you have to put it down!

26:36.996 --> 26:41.200
What --
what's happening?

26:41.234 --> 26:42.935
I don't know.

26:42.969 --> 26:45.938
I can feel
what you're feeling.

26:45.972 --> 26:48.340
I can feel it, too.

26:56.216 --> 26:57.483
What the hell?

27:00.220 --> 27:02.187
What'd you do to her?

27:02.222 --> 27:04.556
Karen. Karen!

27:04.624 --> 27:07.960
What did you do to her?
Ben!

27:07.994 --> 27:11.196
Hey. Hey.

27:11.230 --> 27:12.297
Are you okay?

27:12.331 --> 27:13.631
Yeah.
Yeah, I think so.

27:15.534 --> 27:17.201
What did he do?

27:17.235 --> 27:18.636
I don't know.

27:18.670 --> 27:21.473
I don't know.
We were just --

27:21.507 --> 27:24.509
we were just talking,
and then...

27:24.544 --> 27:27.512
and then I felt this connection
from him.

27:27.547 --> 27:30.249
I was so scared, Hal.

27:30.283 --> 27:33.184
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey.
It's okay. It's okay.

27:45.765 --> 27:47.733
Well, the idea
is simple enough.

27:47.767 --> 27:49.501
We pump blood...

27:49.535 --> 27:51.470
out of Captain Weaver
into this chamber,

27:51.504 --> 27:54.673
where we heat it up
to 105 degrees Fahrenheit,

27:54.708 --> 27:57.409
which, in theory,
should kill whatever it is

27:57.443 --> 27:59.211
that's in the Captain's
bloodstream.

27:59.246 --> 28:00.779
And then we pump it
into this second chamber

28:00.814 --> 28:02.515
where we cool it back down
to normal body temperature,

28:02.549 --> 28:03.750
98.6 degrees.

28:03.784 --> 28:06.286
And then we pump it back
into his body.

28:06.320 --> 28:07.654
How long's
this gonna take?

28:07.689 --> 28:09.156
Eight hours,
more or less.

28:09.190 --> 28:10.624
You said
he could die by then.

28:10.659 --> 28:12.259
If we can reverse
the process,

28:12.294 --> 28:14.128
if we can get the pathogen
to recede

28:14.163 --> 28:16.164
before it attacks
the blood brain barrier,

28:16.198 --> 28:19.100
I think we have a shot
at saving him.

28:19.134 --> 28:21.235
Lourdes,
Weaver's core temperature?

28:21.270 --> 28:23.237
Still 96.

28:23.272 --> 28:26.273
Okay.
Hang in there, Captain.

28:33.281 --> 28:35.115
Nothing more to do
except wait and see.

28:35.150 --> 28:37.117
Can I talk to you
for a second?

28:44.558 --> 28:47.260
I just, uh,
wanted to say

28:47.294 --> 28:48.394
that I'm sorry.

28:48.429 --> 28:49.696
For what?

28:49.730 --> 28:52.732
For thinking that I...
knew more than you.

28:52.766 --> 28:54.166
For everything.

28:54.201 --> 28:57.603
I said it wasn't a big deal,
and it's not.

28:57.637 --> 28:59.572
When things calm down,
we can talk about it,

28:59.606 --> 29:01.174
but right now
I should get back.

29:01.208 --> 29:02.608
Sure.

29:06.346 --> 29:08.314
No, no.

29:08.348 --> 29:09.482
It's the generator.

29:09.516 --> 29:11.284
Lourdes, bag him.

29:11.318 --> 29:14.321
Tom, I'm gonna need you to turn
these pumps manually, okay?

29:14.355 --> 29:17.324
Doesn't need to be fast,
just steady and consistent.

29:17.358 --> 29:18.759
What about the water
temperature?

29:18.793 --> 29:20.327
It should maintain
its heat long enough

29:20.361 --> 29:21.661
for Jamil to get the power
back on.

29:36.437 --> 29:37.403
I got the generator.

29:37.438 --> 29:41.241
Let's get it going.

29:41.275 --> 29:43.109
Ready.

29:43.177 --> 29:45.044
Go!

30:02.495 --> 30:04.296
Whoo!

30:04.364 --> 30:06.598
We hit the jackpot, boss!
Diesel?

30:06.632 --> 30:08.867
Yes, sir.
We got three barrels full.

30:08.901 --> 30:10.402
Got two barrels
of gasoline,

30:10.436 --> 30:11.870
three crates
full of 30 weight oil,

30:11.904 --> 30:13.138
and a whole mess of fan belts
and the like.

30:13.206 --> 30:14.273
Good work, Tector.

30:14.307 --> 30:15.607
There's more
where this came from.

30:15.642 --> 30:16.875
We just couldn't carry it all.
Where?

30:16.909 --> 30:18.009
Southwest, I think.

30:18.044 --> 30:20.111
Look, I almost gave up,
right?

30:20.146 --> 30:21.480
But I had this sort of,
like, intuition,

30:21.547 --> 30:22.982
and my daddy always told me,
he said, "boy --"

30:23.049 --> 30:24.316
Great.

30:24.384 --> 30:26.118
Uh, right now,
we got to get this diesel

30:26.152 --> 30:27.552
over to the generator
and load it up.

30:27.587 --> 30:28.887
Yes, sir.

30:28.921 --> 30:29.888
I'll find Jamil.

30:37.330 --> 30:39.565
What's up, Hal?

30:39.599 --> 30:42.434
I've been looking
all over for you.

30:42.468 --> 30:45.904
We got to figure out
some way to help her, Maggie.

30:45.938 --> 30:47.439
Karen?

30:47.473 --> 30:49.207
What are you
talking about?

30:49.242 --> 30:51.476
Something bad's gonna happen to
her if we don't do something.

30:51.511 --> 30:52.911
No,
you got it backwards.

30:52.945 --> 30:54.580
Something bad's
gonna happen to us

30:54.614 --> 30:56.448
if we don't do something
about her.

30:56.482 --> 30:58.216
It's Ben.

30:59.719 --> 31:01.153
Damn it!

31:01.187 --> 31:02.488
What?

31:02.522 --> 31:05.324
It's that stuff he was doing
with the Skitters. Ah!

31:05.358 --> 31:07.326
His spikes glowing!

31:07.360 --> 31:08.627
And he's doing something
to Karen.

31:08.661 --> 31:10.062
What are you
talking about?

31:10.096 --> 31:12.932
I think he --
he's trying to recruit her.

31:14.367 --> 31:16.468
Something with that --
that Skitter that he brought.

31:16.503 --> 31:19.939
I came in the room...

31:19.973 --> 31:22.942
and they were holding
each other.

31:22.976 --> 31:25.144
And their spikes
were glowing.

31:25.178 --> 31:28.347
Where's Ben now?
I don't know.

31:28.381 --> 31:30.082
You got to go find him.

31:30.116 --> 31:32.618
Okay? If anyone's in danger,
it's him.

31:32.652 --> 31:36.322
You got to trust me
on this.

31:41.328 --> 31:45.030
Shift's over, Jon.

31:45.064 --> 31:48.033
I'll, uh --
I'll take it from here.

31:48.067 --> 31:49.601
Yes, ma'am.

32:07.754 --> 32:09.522
What are you doing?

32:13.393 --> 32:16.228
We're gonna have a little
girl talk, you and I.

32:16.263 --> 32:19.365
I don't understand.

32:19.399 --> 32:22.501
I think you do.

32:22.536 --> 32:27.506
I think you understand really,
really well, actually.

32:27.541 --> 32:30.142
So let's stop
playing games, okay?

32:30.177 --> 32:33.080
Look --
honestly, I don't --

32:36.584 --> 32:40.019
This isn't about Hal, is it? 'Cause --
Yeah.

32:40.054 --> 32:41.688
It's about Hal.

32:41.722 --> 32:43.689
And Ben.

32:43.724 --> 32:46.425
And Tom Mason.

32:46.459 --> 32:49.161
In fact, it's about
the entire 2nd Mass

32:49.195 --> 32:50.429
and how you're
gonna crawl back

32:50.463 --> 32:52.431
to whatever dung heap
you came from

32:52.466 --> 32:53.699
and leave us all alone.

33:00.474 --> 33:04.443
So it's us now, Maggie?

33:04.477 --> 33:09.448
Innocent little Maggie
with a heart of gold?

33:09.482 --> 33:12.117
You know,
I feel sorry for you.

33:12.152 --> 33:15.420
You have spent so long
pushing people away,

33:15.455 --> 33:19.391
you have no idea how to get
close to anyone anymore.

33:19.425 --> 33:22.593
Now you're doing
the same thing with Hal.

33:22.628 --> 33:26.730
'Cause you don't think
you deserve him.

33:26.765 --> 33:29.600
And you know what?

33:29.635 --> 33:31.435
You're right.

33:34.106 --> 33:37.141
You know, I used to think
about your time with Pope.

33:37.175 --> 33:40.077
Despite all your stories
about how they mistreated you,

33:40.112 --> 33:41.379
the truth is,

33:41.413 --> 33:43.214
I think you felt
more comfortable with them

33:43.248 --> 33:46.284
than you have with anyone else
in your whole pathetic life.

33:46.319 --> 33:48.153
You don't know me.

33:48.187 --> 33:50.522
I think I do.

33:50.557 --> 33:53.626
And you know what?

33:53.660 --> 33:56.529
Maybe that life with Pope
and his gang?

33:57.664 --> 34:00.599
Maybe that's the life
you really deserve.

34:22.755 --> 34:25.424
Karen!
What's happening?!

34:27.560 --> 34:29.561
Ohh.

34:33.733 --> 34:35.333
Are you all right?

34:35.367 --> 34:36.668
Yeah, I think so.

34:37.837 --> 34:39.270
She just burst
in here...

34:39.304 --> 34:40.538
We need to get Dr. Glass.

34:40.572 --> 34:42.139
No.

34:42.174 --> 34:44.775
No, Maggie said that no one
could trust us.

34:44.809 --> 34:48.445
She tried to shoot me,
Ben.

34:53.384 --> 34:55.252
We're not safe here.

34:58.256 --> 35:01.525
Where will we
ever be safe?

35:03.728 --> 35:06.563
I know a place...

35:06.598 --> 35:10.567
that we could be safe,
and accepted.

35:10.602 --> 35:13.470
We'll have to leave
here first, though.

35:27.837 --> 35:29.905
This way.

35:33.910 --> 35:37.780
Where?
Which direction?

35:40.685 --> 35:42.219
There.

35:44.890 --> 35:48.192
Ben!

35:48.227 --> 35:50.528
You need to come
with me.

35:50.562 --> 35:51.963
Now.

35:54.099 --> 35:57.068
No. We need to go.

35:57.102 --> 35:59.804
For our protection
and for the 2nd Mass.

35:59.838 --> 36:01.606
I think we'll let dad
weigh in on that.

36:01.640 --> 36:05.109
Now, let's move.
Both of you.

36:19.592 --> 36:22.127
I'm sorry.

36:24.263 --> 36:25.597
It's okay.

36:40.280 --> 36:42.114
Will he be all right?

36:45.285 --> 36:46.585
Yeah.

36:46.620 --> 36:49.588
I'm sorry
it came to this, Ben.

36:49.623 --> 36:52.624
I knew I'd have to leave
sooner or later.

36:57.030 --> 37:02.000
You know,
I loved your brother once.

37:02.035 --> 37:05.137
Very much.

37:05.171 --> 37:07.139
Yeah.

37:07.173 --> 37:10.008
I'm sure
he loved you, too.

37:10.043 --> 37:12.010
But...

37:12.045 --> 37:13.645
I know.

37:49.417 --> 37:51.785
Ready?

37:51.819 --> 37:53.386
Yeah.

38:08.303 --> 38:10.871
So, it's working.

38:10.906 --> 38:12.273
Seems that way.

38:12.307 --> 38:15.009
At least he's finally breathing
on his own.

38:15.043 --> 38:16.911
His core temperature is back
in the range of normal.

38:20.315 --> 38:21.715
That's good news.

38:21.749 --> 38:23.417
But he's not
out of the woods yet.

38:23.451 --> 38:26.753
There's no telling what
collateral damage has been done.

38:26.788 --> 38:28.955
I just hope we killed
whatever it was

38:28.990 --> 38:31.091
that caused this
in the first place.

38:31.125 --> 38:33.360
It's really
up to him now.

38:33.394 --> 38:36.096
Well, we got enough fuel
to last for a few more days.

38:36.130 --> 38:38.131
But the food stores
are almost depleted.

38:38.166 --> 38:40.200
I need to send more scouts
out for food.

38:40.234 --> 38:42.068
And that's gonna mean
burning more fuel.

38:42.102 --> 38:43.703
We're running low
on ammunition.

38:43.737 --> 38:45.772
I'm getting complaints
about sanitation issues.

38:45.806 --> 38:48.007
People are asking when
we're leaving for Charleston.

38:48.042 --> 38:49.442
They're panicked
over rumors

38:49.477 --> 38:51.110
that Skitters
are heading our way --

38:51.145 --> 38:53.713
Hey...

38:53.747 --> 38:56.116
We'll get through this
together, okay?

38:56.150 --> 38:58.251
I know.

38:58.285 --> 39:01.054
Dr. Glass!

39:01.088 --> 39:03.323
I don't believe it.

39:03.357 --> 39:06.159
Captain.
Can you hear me?

39:10.131 --> 39:12.432
Don't try to speak.
Lourdes, water.

39:17.771 --> 39:19.806
No, just hold on.

39:19.840 --> 39:21.808
You're doing good.

39:21.842 --> 39:22.942
Small sips, captain.

39:22.977 --> 39:24.110
I know.

39:28.048 --> 39:30.750
How...

39:32.453 --> 39:34.521
How...

39:34.555 --> 39:36.523
It's complicated.

39:39.260 --> 39:42.962
How much fuel did we burn
saving my sorry ass?

39:47.167 --> 39:49.535
It was worth every gallon,
Captain.

39:49.570 --> 39:51.571
You gave the order?

39:55.175 --> 39:56.909
Something like that.

39:58.812 --> 40:03.315
You and I are gonna have words
when I get out of this bed.

40:03.349 --> 40:05.918
Well,
I look forward to it.

40:05.952 --> 40:07.453
Excuse me, Professor, sir.
Yeah, what is it?

40:07.487 --> 40:09.321
It's Pope, sir.
He's awake and asking for you.

40:09.356 --> 40:11.290
All right,
I'll be right there.

40:11.324 --> 40:13.225
Well, he says it's a matter
of life and death.

40:15.061 --> 40:17.162
There's a lot
to fill you in on.

40:17.196 --> 40:18.530
I'll be back.

40:18.564 --> 40:22.033
Lourdes?
Don't let him do too much.

40:22.067 --> 40:23.334
You want more water?

40:23.368 --> 40:25.936
Pope?

40:25.971 --> 40:28.472
I'm getting out of here. We all
need to get out of here now!

40:28.506 --> 40:30.040
You need to calm
yourself down.

40:30.074 --> 40:31.475
All right, Pope.
What's your problem?

40:31.509 --> 40:33.009
You're here.
You're safe.

40:33.044 --> 40:35.145
No. No, Professor.
I am <i>not</i> safe.

40:35.179 --> 40:37.347
We are anything but safe.

40:37.381 --> 40:40.049
They're on their way.
They're on their way to you.

40:40.083 --> 40:41.217
Who?

40:41.251 --> 40:43.919
The fish-heads.

40:43.987 --> 40:44.987
They're looking for you.

40:45.022 --> 40:46.189
To be more precise,

40:46.223 --> 40:47.823
they're looking
for your boy -- Ben.

40:47.858 --> 40:49.458
Ben? Why?

40:49.493 --> 40:52.195
Skitters had me pinned down,
overrun.

40:52.229 --> 40:54.931
Next thing I know, I'm staring
straight at a fish-head

40:54.965 --> 40:57.100
who wants to know
exactly where you guys are.

40:57.134 --> 40:58.935
Us?

40:58.969 --> 41:02.372
How did it know that you were
part of the 2nd Mass?

41:02.406 --> 41:05.241
They had a harnessed girl
who was there.

41:05.276 --> 41:07.243
She's the one who did all the talking.
What girl?

41:07.278 --> 41:08.978
You know the one,
the blonde.

41:09.013 --> 41:10.847
The one your oldest boy
was sweet on.

41:10.881 --> 41:12.182
Karen?

41:12.216 --> 41:14.450
That's her.
Scary as hell.

41:14.485 --> 41:16.085
Man, it's like she could
take her hand,

41:16.120 --> 41:17.520
reach right into your brain
and squeeze.

41:17.554 --> 41:19.188
What did they want
with Ben?

41:19.223 --> 41:21.057
I heard some --
some crazy ass talk

41:21.091 --> 41:22.391
about a Skitter rebellion

41:22.426 --> 41:24.260
and your lizard boy
being a part of it.

41:24.294 --> 41:25.394
How long ago was this?

41:25.428 --> 41:27.262
I don't know.

41:27.296 --> 41:29.097
It was two days ago
when I grabbed you.

41:40.976 --> 41:43.410
Stay with her.
Ben?

41:43.445 --> 41:45.913
Ben?
