01:47.905 --> 01:49.202
Hello, Clark.

01:50.174 --> 01:52.142
My name is Kara.

01:53.010 --> 01:54.534
I'm from Krypton.

02:49.433 --> 02:52.095
Kara, I don't know where you heard
about Krypton...

02:52.269 --> 02:54.931
...but an astronomer told me
that planet was destroyed.

02:55.105 --> 02:57.232
Its physical form is gone...

02:57.407 --> 02:59.068
...but it still lives on through us.

03:00.110 --> 03:01.509
Here, this will warm you up.

03:07.484 --> 03:09.042
It's hot tea.

03:12.289 --> 03:13.586
Young lady...

03:14.324 --> 03:17.259
...your parents must be worried.
Why don't you let us call them.

03:17.427 --> 03:18.689
There's no one to call.

03:18.862 --> 03:22.025
Well, you can't sleep out in the field.
You'll stay with us tonight.

03:22.866 --> 03:25.835
Thank you. I heard you were very kind.

03:26.937 --> 03:28.529
How exactly did you get here?

03:28.906 --> 03:30.965
I came through a passage in the cave wall.

03:32.609 --> 03:34.270
A passage from where?

03:35.379 --> 03:38.075
A place where all your questions
will be answered.

03:39.216 --> 03:41.343
Where you don't have to hide
your true self.

03:41.518 --> 03:45.887
Look, if you really are from some distant
planet, why don't you us a favor, huh?

03:46.323 --> 03:48.689
Give us a display
of all of your special abilities.

03:50.294 --> 03:51.659
-Dad--
-Clark...

03:52.696 --> 03:56.063
...you told me yourself that Pete's
being harassed by the FBl.

03:56.233 --> 03:58.394
How do we know
that this isn't just some ploy?

03:59.403 --> 04:03.499
Jonathan Kent, you have no place
in this conversation.

04:04.041 --> 04:06.942
I will show Kal-El
all he needs to see in due time.

04:08.245 --> 04:09.872
Where did you hear that name?

04:13.317 --> 04:14.978
It was given to you at birth.

04:16.219 --> 04:17.516
Why are you here?

04:20.357 --> 04:21.880
To take you home.

04:25.929 --> 04:27.556
Clark?

04:28.098 --> 04:29.360
Lex.

04:29.967 --> 04:33.027
-Hey, do you have a second?
-This is...

04:40.577 --> 04:41.805
...good a time as any.

04:56.426 --> 04:59.657
I thought you'd be out celebrating.
Your dad's finally behind bars.

04:59.963 --> 05:03.160
My father has a battalion of lawyers
more powerful than Caesar's army.

05:03.333 --> 05:05.426
He'll be out on bail
in less than 48 hours.

05:05.936 --> 05:09.099
I don't think the judge is gonna
let a murderer out on the street.

05:09.272 --> 05:12.673
The only way he'll be denied bail
is if there's evidence at his hearing...

05:12.843 --> 05:16.108
-...he's an imminent threat to society.
-What about Chloe's voice mail?

05:16.279 --> 05:19.180
The one with your dad's confession on it?
That can be damaging.

05:19.383 --> 05:21.613
It will be, for the grand jury.

05:22.119 --> 05:25.020
But in order to deny him bail,
they need eyewitnesses.

05:25.188 --> 05:27.656
People who've seen my father
actually inflict harm.

05:27.991 --> 05:30.926
Unfortunately, anyone who's been privy
to his darkest moments...

05:31.094 --> 05:33.562
...is either dead
or unwilling to come forward.

05:35.732 --> 05:37.529
I'll come forward.

05:38.402 --> 05:42.099
I appreciate the support, Clark,
but they need an eyewitness.

05:42.606 --> 05:44.130
I saw him at Belle Reve.

05:46.209 --> 05:50.168
I saw him order the doctor
to increase your electroshock voltage...

05:51.782 --> 05:54.808
...even when the doctor said
it could turn you into a vegetable.

05:57.821 --> 05:59.288
How could you have seen that?

06:01.558 --> 06:03.253
I snuck in to try to save you...

06:04.294 --> 06:05.693
...but I was too late.

06:07.898 --> 06:11.356
You knew all along my father murdered
his parents, didn't you?

06:12.736 --> 06:13.896
And you never told me.

06:14.071 --> 06:16.539
-Lex--
-I assumed there was an agreement...

06:16.707 --> 06:19.301
...among friends to share that kind
of information.

06:19.476 --> 06:21.410
Not when it can get your friend killed.

06:23.213 --> 06:27.445
Lex, your father threw you in
a mental institution and fried your brain.

06:27.951 --> 06:29.748
If you found that out all over again...

06:29.920 --> 06:32.582
...I thought he'd kill you.
And I couldn't live with that.

06:41.498 --> 06:43.090
You're a good friend, Clark.

06:44.668 --> 06:46.932
If you tell the judge
what you just told me...

06:48.138 --> 06:51.767
...my father will be exchanging his Armani
for an orange jumpsuit.

06:54.311 --> 06:56.074
I'll be there. You can count on it.

06:59.983 --> 07:02.178
Six-one, clear. Opening up.

07:06.590 --> 07:07.852
I thought we had a deal, Loder.

07:08.024 --> 07:09.651
I tipped you off on Lex's wire...

07:09.826 --> 07:12.818
...I made sure discriminating
recordings disappeared...

07:12.996 --> 07:15.521
...I can't control a bleached blond,
Pulitzer-wannabe...

07:15.699 --> 07:18.259
...from dredging up evidence
for a decades-old homicide.

07:18.668 --> 07:22.160
And our other investigation? Lex's
friend? What's the status of that?

07:23.507 --> 07:24.940
You're a piece of work.

07:25.108 --> 07:28.669
In case you haven't noticed, you're a hop,
skip and a jump from death row...

07:29.045 --> 07:32.344
...and no hick farm kid's secret's gonna
be able to save your ass.

07:32.516 --> 07:35.610
This is an inconvenience.
I'll be out on bail in a couple of hours.

07:35.786 --> 07:39.654
Then I expect you to send me the
information you've gathered on Clark Kent.

07:39.990 --> 07:42.515
You can expect to be waiting
for a very long time.

07:43.493 --> 07:45.427
Our deal's over, Mr. Luthor.

07:47.464 --> 07:49.932
You're venturing into
dangerous waters, Loder.

07:50.567 --> 07:53.559
I'm a pretty decent swimmer.
Night-night.

07:55.338 --> 07:57.636
Opening 6-1.

08:04.614 --> 08:07.174
You shouldn't involve yourself
in their problems.

08:09.619 --> 08:12.611
-Lex is my friend. I want to help him.
-You can't trust him.

08:13.290 --> 08:14.780
You don't know him.

08:15.158 --> 08:16.420
I don't have to.

08:17.093 --> 08:19.288
It's human nature.
It's just who they are.

08:19.763 --> 08:21.788
They happen to be the people I care about.

08:21.965 --> 08:25.196
Which is why it will be that much harder
when they all betray you.

08:26.036 --> 08:28.163
I can understand why you're scared.

08:29.239 --> 08:30.706
This is all you know.

08:33.577 --> 08:36.136
But you're not meant
for this world, Kal-El.

08:36.813 --> 08:38.712
You were meant for mine.

08:39.649 --> 08:41.116
My name's Clark.

08:42.485 --> 08:45.648
-Why should I believe anything you say?
-Because it's the truth.

08:45.989 --> 08:47.251
Really?

08:47.457 --> 08:50.949
Why don't you start by telling me
where you've been for the last 1 4 years?

08:52.229 --> 08:53.924
If you join me...

08:54.598 --> 08:56.498
...all your questions will be answered.

08:59.002 --> 09:00.560
That's not good enough.

09:02.706 --> 09:04.298
Kal-El, wait.

09:05.709 --> 09:07.040
Come with me.

09:25.061 --> 09:28.189
-How are you doing this?
-You're doing it too.

09:30.166 --> 09:31.428
I can't fly.

09:32.435 --> 09:33.697
Not yet.

09:34.437 --> 09:36.530
This is just the beginning, Kal-El.

09:39.042 --> 09:41.909
You have no idea
how powerful you'll become.

09:51.521 --> 09:53.489
This fissure wasn't here last week.

09:53.957 --> 09:55.652
It opened to release me.

09:56.459 --> 09:58.256
It'll open again when we go.

10:00.096 --> 10:02.189
What makes you think
I don't like this world?

10:03.400 --> 10:05.925
I can sense how sad you are, Kal-El.

10:06.569 --> 10:09.197
Not a day goes by where you don't
feel like an outsider.

10:09.973 --> 10:14.376
Even those closest to you will never
truly understand you.

10:18.348 --> 10:20.179
But it doesn't have to be that way.

10:26.756 --> 10:29.088
You've been down here
ever since the meteor shower?

10:29.259 --> 10:30.419
Yes.

10:30.593 --> 10:33.084
Waiting for the time
when he knew you'd be ready.

10:33.263 --> 10:34.423
He?

10:34.597 --> 10:35.757
Your birth father.

10:36.333 --> 10:37.630
Jor-El.

10:38.568 --> 10:41.503
-He died in Krypton.
-Yes...

10:41.972 --> 10:44.941
...but his spirit and will live on
inside these walls.

10:47.978 --> 10:49.343
I should've known.

10:51.448 --> 10:53.643
He's not the monster that you imagine.

10:54.884 --> 10:56.351
He saved your life.

10:58.254 --> 11:00.484
To turn me into something
I never wanted to be.

11:00.657 --> 11:02.852
You may think you know your destiny...

11:03.526 --> 11:06.154
...but you've no idea what greatness
lies ahead of you.

11:07.030 --> 11:08.463
Then why don't you tell me?

11:11.534 --> 11:13.559
I'm only here to help your transition.

11:15.605 --> 11:18.039
Everything that you want to know...

11:18.341 --> 11:20.502
...Iies through there.

11:22.012 --> 11:23.775
But it has to be your choice.

11:30.987 --> 11:33.080
Come with me, Kal-El.

11:37.193 --> 11:38.956
I can't do this.

11:43.033 --> 11:44.398
Just know...

11:45.335 --> 11:46.529
...when you're ready...

11:47.003 --> 11:48.664
...I'll be waiting for you.

12:04.454 --> 12:06.684
Orange is a good color for you, Dad...

12:07.223 --> 12:12.126
...although it might get a little old
after 25 to life.

12:12.295 --> 12:14.855
I didn't ask you here to trade insults.

12:21.704 --> 12:23.604
No matter how wide...

12:24.641 --> 12:28.202
...the chasm gets between us, son...

12:30.413 --> 12:32.574
...I'm your father. I'll always be your father.

12:32.749 --> 12:35.684
And the devil that's haunted me
since the day I was born.

12:37.420 --> 12:39.479
Lex, this is not easy for me.

12:43.426 --> 12:44.791
As a father...

12:45.462 --> 12:46.827
...I....

12:49.933 --> 12:51.662
I have failed you.

12:53.236 --> 12:54.863
I realize that now.

12:55.271 --> 12:56.533
And...

12:57.474 --> 12:58.805
...I'm sorry.

13:02.745 --> 13:05.805
Two years ago I was diagnosed with a....

13:06.382 --> 13:10.113
A degenerative liver disease.

13:11.921 --> 13:15.084
I've tried everything,
everything imaginable...

13:16.025 --> 13:17.390
...but...

13:18.728 --> 13:20.093
...there's nothing.

13:21.197 --> 13:22.528
It's too late.

13:23.666 --> 13:25.463
No amount of money can save me.

13:33.376 --> 13:34.968
Lex...

13:35.145 --> 13:36.737
...please...

13:38.281 --> 13:40.078
...don't let me die in prison.

14:00.503 --> 14:01.765
Dad...

14:04.774 --> 14:07.106
...this might have been more effective...

14:07.677 --> 14:11.545
...if you had a string quartet in the corner
playing "Barber's Requiem."

14:16.986 --> 14:18.317
I understand.

14:19.189 --> 14:20.656
How could you trust me?

14:22.258 --> 14:24.522
I've asked my doctors...

14:24.894 --> 14:28.830
...to release my medical files to you.
You can see for yourself.

14:56.759 --> 14:59.751
She hasn't eaten anything
since she's been here.

14:59.929 --> 15:02.261
Martha, her appetite
is the least of our problems.

15:02.432 --> 15:04.229
I think she's for real.

15:04.534 --> 15:05.831
I think Jor-El sent her.

15:06.002 --> 15:08.493
-Are you sure?
-How else can we explain her powers?

15:08.671 --> 15:12.004
This is Smallville. Kryptonite's given
a lot of people special abilities.

15:12.175 --> 15:14.575
She knows my birth name.
She knows everything.

15:14.744 --> 15:17.975
She doesn't know anything more
about you than Dr. Swann.

15:18.147 --> 15:21.139
-Do you think Swann sent Kara?
-I've no idea what his agenda is.

15:21.317 --> 15:23.979
But wherever this girl is from,
I don't trust her.

15:24.153 --> 15:27.213
You're the one who cannot be trusted,
Jonathan Kent.

15:27.390 --> 15:29.085
You broke the covenant.

15:29.759 --> 15:33.456
Jor-El gave you many warnings,
but you chose not to listen to them.

15:33.630 --> 15:35.393
What is she talking about, Jonathan?

15:37.600 --> 15:39.158
Tell Kal-El what you did.

15:40.903 --> 15:42.564
What kind of deal did you make, Dad?

15:47.777 --> 15:50.871
I promised Jor-El
that if he gave me the power...

15:51.080 --> 15:53.207
...to bring you back from Metropolis...

15:55.485 --> 15:57.680
...that one day I'd return you to him.

15:57.854 --> 15:59.719
Jonathan, you didn't do that.

15:59.889 --> 16:02.653
-I had no idea it was gonna be this soon.
-No.

16:02.825 --> 16:05.794
I told you, Kal-El.
They'll always betray you.

16:06.896 --> 16:08.659
Even the man you call your father.

16:08.831 --> 16:10.958
-I did not betray my son.
-Quiet.

16:13.870 --> 16:15.633
Someone's listening.

16:15.805 --> 16:17.636
What are you talking about?

16:20.610 --> 16:22.077
How'd you do that?

16:36.159 --> 16:37.421
Who are you?

16:39.529 --> 16:40.860
Get out of my way!

16:55.845 --> 16:57.369
What did you do to him?

16:57.780 --> 16:59.805
That man feared you, Kal-El.

17:00.450 --> 17:03.544
-He wanted to exploit you.
-So you killed him?

17:05.088 --> 17:07.021
He didn't feel any pain.

17:12.962 --> 17:16.397
She killed a man, Jonathan.
We have to call the sheriff.

17:16.566 --> 17:20.627
What are we gonna tell the sheriff? A
Kryptonian girl vaporized a federal agent?

17:21.237 --> 17:24.172
-What have you invited into our lives?
-Martha...

17:25.174 --> 17:27.267
...I don't believe l
had another choice.

17:27.443 --> 17:30.640
How could you have made that decision
without talking to me?

17:30.813 --> 17:32.974
It was the only way
that I could get him back.

17:35.251 --> 17:37.617
Why would you keep it a secret?

17:39.756 --> 17:42.623
I didn't want you to have to wait
for the rest of your life...

17:42.792 --> 17:45.226
...worrying about something
that might never happen.

17:45.395 --> 17:48.922
Do you really think Jor-El
will ever give up on Clark?

17:49.098 --> 17:51.089
I can't sit idly by while he takes our son.

17:51.267 --> 17:56.034
We might not have a choice.
That girl is more powerful than Clark.

18:08.351 --> 18:12.185
-Mr. Kent?
-So this is the legendary Torch.

18:12.355 --> 18:15.085
Yeah. A little less glamorous
than you imagined, huh?

18:15.958 --> 18:19.018
If you're looking for Clark,
I haven't seen a trace of him.

18:20.963 --> 18:22.191
I was looking for you.

18:23.933 --> 18:26.527
Something's telling me you're not
throwing a tea party.

18:26.702 --> 18:29.933
I understand that you're very good
at getting to the bottom of things.

18:30.973 --> 18:32.702
Do you think you could...

18:32.875 --> 18:35.366
...run the fingerprints
off of this for me?

18:36.112 --> 18:37.477
No problem.

18:38.080 --> 18:40.480
Is there a name that's attached
to the fingerprints?

18:40.650 --> 18:42.584
That's what I need to find out, Chloe.

18:42.752 --> 18:45.516
I need the identity of the last person
to touch that cup.

18:47.223 --> 18:48.588
Okay.

18:48.758 --> 18:51.852
If I could get a little more info
on this mystery, it might help-

18:52.028 --> 18:55.225
Chloe, as a personal favor to me,
please don't press the issue.

18:57.033 --> 18:58.557
Okay. Yeah.

18:59.202 --> 19:00.601
I'll call my guy right now.

19:02.171 --> 19:03.536
Thank you.

19:07.577 --> 19:09.044
It's gonna take a little while.

19:10.680 --> 19:11.942
Of course.

19:26.095 --> 19:27.722
I thought you'd be packing.

19:27.897 --> 19:31.890
Well, if I squeeze anything else into
my suitcases, I think they'd explode.

19:34.470 --> 19:35.732
So when are you taking off?

19:36.005 --> 19:38.439
Well, I have to be at the airport
by noon tomorrow.

19:40.209 --> 19:42.268
That's sort of why I'm here.

19:44.347 --> 19:47.874
I was wondering if you would mind
being my SuperShuttle.

19:48.618 --> 19:50.051
Sure.

19:51.821 --> 19:53.846
I know it's been a strange year...

19:54.023 --> 19:57.356
...but I hate leaving with the feeling
things aren't settled between us.

19:59.662 --> 20:02.961
-Lana, when I said I want you to be happy-
-When you invited me over...

20:03.132 --> 20:07.364
...and you had something important
to tell me, that wasn't it, was it?

20:10.172 --> 20:14.006
Clark, if you have something to say to me,
say it before I'm gone.

20:23.819 --> 20:25.946
-Lana....
-Who's that?

20:33.563 --> 20:34.825
My cousin.

20:37.199 --> 20:39.064
You've never mentioned her before.

20:40.002 --> 20:41.264
Where's she from?

20:42.204 --> 20:44.638
Far away. California.

20:45.541 --> 20:48.442
Well, you know, if you--
If you've got company, I should--

20:48.611 --> 20:50.875
-I should find a ride from someone else.
-Lana.

20:52.415 --> 20:55.680
Even though it's gonna be hard to see
you go, I wanna be there for you.

21:05.227 --> 21:07.127
We'll talk in the car? Tomorrow?

21:20.610 --> 21:22.305
She really does love you.

21:23.613 --> 21:25.478
But it's not meant to be.
You know that.

21:25.648 --> 21:27.275
No one knows what's meant to be.

21:27.817 --> 21:30.342
Not you, not even Jor-El.

21:32.088 --> 21:34.249
Don't let it upset you, Kal-El.

21:35.558 --> 21:38.186
What you share with Lana
is an earthly love...

21:39.161 --> 21:42.096
...filled with doubts,
and pain and sorrow.

21:43.099 --> 21:47.695
The love between us will be stronger
than anything you can imagine.

21:48.838 --> 21:51.466
You and I are the only ones left, Kal-El.

21:53.142 --> 21:56.236
We're the only ones
who can preserve the Kryptonian race.

21:58.681 --> 22:00.171
Come with me, Kal-El.

22:01.684 --> 22:03.015
Come home.

22:04.620 --> 22:05.985
This is my home.

22:06.589 --> 22:08.853
I know it seems that way...

22:09.358 --> 22:15.763
...but sooner or later everyone you know
here will lie, betray or leave you.

22:17.233 --> 22:19.292
No matter what you say...

22:19.902 --> 22:21.529
...I'll never go with you.

22:40.056 --> 22:41.785
Clark Kent?

22:43.893 --> 22:46.157
I have a package for you.

22:46.762 --> 22:48.024
Who's it from?

22:48.364 --> 22:50.229
A Mr. Lionel Luthor.

23:13.489 --> 23:16.788
Johns Hopkins, the Mayo Clinic.

23:18.694 --> 23:20.286
My father's knocked on the door...

23:20.463 --> 23:23.626
...of every major medical institution
in the Western world...

23:23.799 --> 23:26.267
...and was sent home each time
without a cure.

23:29.972 --> 23:32.566
I'm sensing you're having second thoughts.

23:33.409 --> 23:35.570
Lex, I understand if you want to back out.

23:35.745 --> 23:40.648
He needs to be punished for what he did,
but he's still your father and he's dying.

23:41.717 --> 23:43.207
Yeah...

23:43.385 --> 23:46.149
...and he's gonna draw his last
breath in prison...

23:46.322 --> 23:49.519
...not the VlP suite at Metropolis General.

23:51.127 --> 23:53.721
But only if you're still willing
to go through with this.

23:55.097 --> 23:56.894
I don't think I like the sound of this.

23:57.066 --> 23:58.363
Chloe....

23:59.235 --> 24:02.432
A dying man has little to lose.

24:03.272 --> 24:07.538
My father used a bizarre blood platelet
cocktail to raise the dead...

24:07.710 --> 24:11.168
...then pinned the murders
of the research team on his son.

24:11.614 --> 24:15.050
Who knows what tactics he'll use
to avoid going to prison.

24:15.484 --> 24:17.645
Yeah, but the FBl guaranteed our safety.

24:17.820 --> 24:21.449
They're putting me and my father in
protective custody until after the trial.

24:21.624 --> 24:23.216
Then what?

24:24.059 --> 24:27.756
-Lex, are you trying to scare me?
-I'm worried about you, Chloe.

24:27.930 --> 24:31.491
I want you to have all the facts before
you walk into that courtroom.

24:35.404 --> 24:38.271
Your father's intimidated me long enough.

24:38.874 --> 24:40.967
I'm not backing down.

24:49.852 --> 24:51.513
What is this?

24:53.823 --> 24:55.120
A key.

24:55.491 --> 24:58.551
Unfortunately not the one
we're both looking for.

24:58.727 --> 25:00.820
If you wanna play games, I'll leave.

25:00.996 --> 25:02.725
Clark....

25:04.500 --> 25:09.961
My lawyers told me that your name has
appeared on the prosecution's witness list.

25:11.373 --> 25:13.841
I can only assume
that Lex has you buying...

25:14.009 --> 25:18.036
...into his version of our Oedipal struggle.

25:18.214 --> 25:21.047
I am a poor misguided....
Et cetera, et cetera.

25:21.650 --> 25:24.050
Buy into this: You're a murderer.

25:25.588 --> 25:28.216
I didn't kill my parents, Clark.

25:28.390 --> 25:31.848
I certainly didn't shed any tears
at their funeral.

25:32.027 --> 25:34.791
You have no idea what it's like
to grow up under...

25:34.964 --> 25:37.524
...the thumb of an abusive father...

25:37.700 --> 25:42.228
...someone who'd stop at nothing
to establish absolute control over you.

25:42.404 --> 25:44.201
Your son does.

25:44.373 --> 25:46.398
Lex is an expert by now.

25:47.276 --> 25:50.734
An expert at lies and subterfuge.

25:54.350 --> 25:56.477
That key you're holding....

25:57.052 --> 25:58.917
It opens a door.

25:59.088 --> 26:02.489
Third floor, east wing, Luthor mansion.

26:03.926 --> 26:05.917
You'll be fascinated by what you find.

26:06.095 --> 26:08.222
I'm not walking into some kind of trap.

26:08.397 --> 26:11.298
Last time I listened to you,
I became a lab rat at Summerholt.

26:12.568 --> 26:14.263
Clark...

26:14.436 --> 26:16.427
...I don't wanna harm you.

26:16.605 --> 26:18.903
I want to enlighten you.

26:19.775 --> 26:23.541
You want answers?
You're gonna find them.

26:23.712 --> 26:26.681
Answers you won't believe.

27:44.660 --> 27:48.096
-Before you jump to conclusions--
-You said you stopped investigating me.

27:48.364 --> 27:51.492
-I did.
-You did? Then what is this?

27:54.136 --> 27:57.867
I understand how you could think
all this is about you...

27:59.141 --> 28:00.768
...but in fact it's about me.

28:02.044 --> 28:03.341
More lies.

28:07.349 --> 28:10.841
So much of my own life I can't explain.

28:12.454 --> 28:17.687
I survived countless brushes with death,
and it all started with this car crash.

28:20.429 --> 28:25.128
If I'm guilty of anything, it's that I inherited
my father's curiosity for the unexplained.

28:25.734 --> 28:27.725
You've inherited his dishonesty.

28:30.105 --> 28:33.472
Clark, look me in the eye and tell me
you don't have any hidden places...

28:33.642 --> 28:36.167
...where you keep deep, dark secrets.

28:40.549 --> 28:42.847
Ever since I met you,
I've been defending you.

28:43.085 --> 28:46.213
Making excuses for you
to people like Pete, like my parents...

28:46.722 --> 28:49.589
...telling them, "You can trust Lex Luthor,
he's a good guy.

28:51.427 --> 28:53.759
He's nothing like his father."

28:56.799 --> 28:58.562
I was wrong.

29:00.436 --> 29:02.028
Clark....

29:11.213 --> 29:15.343
I can't believe he pretended to be my friend
for three years just to investigate me.

29:16.218 --> 29:19.654
I'm so sorry. I know how hard
this must be for you.

29:19.888 --> 29:21.947
Maybe Kara's right.

29:22.458 --> 29:25.916
She warned me that all my friends
would betray me.

29:26.895 --> 29:28.123
Maybe I don't belong here.

29:28.297 --> 29:31.130
-Maybe there's a better place for me.
-No. No.

29:31.300 --> 29:34.758
I've done everything in my power
to defy Jor-El.

29:34.937 --> 29:36.871
Mom, it's only made things worse.

29:37.039 --> 29:39.098
-Clark--
-Maybe I should go.

29:39.475 --> 29:40.772
Oh, sweetheart.

29:42.978 --> 29:45.538
You don't have to decide anything
right this minute.

29:45.714 --> 29:49.343
You know? It's been an incredibly
difficult time for you.

29:49.518 --> 29:53.318
With Pete gone, and Lana leaving....

29:54.423 --> 29:55.412
Lana....

30:23.519 --> 30:24.645
Lex.

30:26.889 --> 30:29.153
I just wanted to say bon voyage.

30:29.758 --> 30:31.350
Shouldn't you be at the courthouse?

30:31.894 --> 30:34.226
My father can wait.

30:34.396 --> 30:37.126
I couldn't let the last person
you saw from Smallville...

30:37.299 --> 30:40.097
...be the shuttle driver looking for his tip.

30:40.269 --> 30:43.898
Lex, I can't thank you enough
for everything that you've done for me.

30:44.072 --> 30:48.065
It's pretty clear your destiny lies far
beyond the Smallville city limits.

30:48.243 --> 30:50.143
I'm just trying to help you get there.

30:52.714 --> 30:55.615
I don't know what I did to deserve
such a great friend...

30:55.784 --> 30:58.651
...but I'm glad
that you came into my life.

30:59.821 --> 31:02.187
Maybe I'll bump into you
on the Champs Elysees.

31:04.426 --> 31:05.893
Are you gonna be in Paris?

31:06.828 --> 31:10.025
I haven't been in a couple years,
but now I have reason to go.

32:19.268 --> 32:20.565
Lex....

32:20.936 --> 32:25.168
Clark isn't here. The judge says if he's not
here in five minutes, he's setting bail.

32:25.340 --> 32:28.366
-Did you try calling?
-At home and on his cell phone. No answer.

32:28.543 --> 32:31.478
Something big must've happened
because he flaked on Lana too.

32:31.713 --> 32:33.510
-Lex, what's going on?
-Nothing.

32:33.782 --> 32:36.615
I'm just hoping Clark
didn't change his mind.

32:38.020 --> 32:40.750
You're his best friend.
Why would he do that?

32:44.393 --> 32:46.418
There he is, just in time to save the day.

32:47.929 --> 32:49.396
Clark, hey....

33:00.442 --> 33:03.275
How do you feel about prison
now that you've been denied bail?

33:03.445 --> 33:07.472
You know, it's nothing new to be in prison
and to be an innocent man.

33:08.116 --> 33:11.313
In the end, I have no doubt
that justice will prevail.

33:11.486 --> 33:12.953
Are you planning an appeal, sir?

33:14.289 --> 33:15.586
Clark....

33:16.792 --> 33:20.523
-Thanks for showing up. It means a lot to me.
-I didn't come here for you, Lex.

33:20.696 --> 33:23.460
I came because it's the right thing to do.

33:24.866 --> 33:26.197
This friendship's over.

33:58.767 --> 34:01.497
Everything you said has come true.

34:02.204 --> 34:05.901
I take no pleasure in your anguish, Kal-El.

34:07.376 --> 34:10.868
I know that you have great feelings
for these people...

34:11.446 --> 34:13.880
...and they will miss you when
you're gone.

34:15.117 --> 34:19.076
Ever since the meteor shower
I've brought them nothing but pain.

34:21.289 --> 34:24.053
Come with me, Kal-El...

34:24.326 --> 34:26.317
...and she will ease your suffering.

34:28.929 --> 34:30.487
She?

34:32.234 --> 34:34.259
Your birth mother.

34:35.871 --> 34:37.429
Lara?

34:38.306 --> 34:40.934
She's missed you so much.

34:43.779 --> 34:45.770
How could she?

34:46.380 --> 34:48.143
She died.

34:50.085 --> 34:53.851
Her love lives on...

34:54.188 --> 34:57.625
...and will embrace you
all the days of your life.

35:12.007 --> 35:13.702
I'm ready.

35:23.185 --> 35:24.982
-How long has Clark been gone?
-Since 3.

35:25.153 --> 35:29.556
-Jonathan, the way he was talking....
-Call the Talon. I'm gonna check the caves.

35:34.095 --> 35:36.757
Mr. Kent, I found a match
for your phantom fingerprints.

35:36.932 --> 35:40.231
And even for me,
the keeper of the Wall of Weird...

35:40.402 --> 35:41.892
...it's extremely weird.

36:06.294 --> 36:07.989
Clark! Wait!

36:09.798 --> 36:14.098
Her name is not Kara. Her name is
Lindsay. And she's not from Krypton.

36:14.269 --> 36:15.566
What are you talking about?

36:15.737 --> 36:19.036
-lgnore him, Kal-El.
-Chloe matched her fingerprints...

36:19.207 --> 36:21.072
...to a young girl...

36:21.243 --> 36:25.771
...who was arrested
for shoplifting 1 6 years ago.

36:25.947 --> 36:28.313
Your name is Lindsay Harrison.

36:28.650 --> 36:32.108
-My name is Kara.
-You were driving with your mother...

36:32.287 --> 36:34.187
...on the day of the meteor shower.

36:34.356 --> 36:36.790
Your car got a direct hit on Route 8.

36:36.958 --> 36:38.516
That's right here near the caves.

36:39.895 --> 36:41.692
Clark, Lindsay's body was never found.

36:43.798 --> 36:47.290
-You haven't aged a day.
-Because I've been waiting for you...

36:47.836 --> 36:49.303
...in there.

36:49.471 --> 36:50.995
No, Lindsay.

36:51.172 --> 36:53.140
Jor-El used you.

36:53.308 --> 36:56.072
He stole away your life.
He stripped you of your humanity...

36:56.244 --> 36:59.873
...all so he could lure Clark to him.

37:00.749 --> 37:02.649
You two have to come with me right now.

37:02.817 --> 37:04.876
Go with Kara, Kal-El.

37:07.222 --> 37:09.053
I'm not going anywhere!

37:10.825 --> 37:13.123
I'll never be who you want me to be!

37:18.633 --> 37:22.000
-What did you do to her?
-She served her purpose...

37:22.170 --> 37:24.001
...as has Jonathan Kent.

37:28.410 --> 37:30.207
Dad!

37:31.780 --> 37:34.647
-Leave my father alone!
-Come forward...

37:34.983 --> 37:36.541
...or he will die.

37:40.989 --> 37:43.219
Come to me, Kal-El.

37:44.559 --> 37:45.583
Clark!

37:46.094 --> 37:48.756
I've lived a full life, son.

37:49.164 --> 37:54.761
Jor-El can do whatever he wants
to do to me as long as you're free.

37:54.936 --> 37:56.767
I'll never be free.

37:57.472 --> 37:59.497
Clark! No!

38:32.874 --> 38:34.171
Do it.

41:56.911 --> 41:58.845
Thank you.

42:02.984 --> 42:05.976
Kal-El, my son.

42:08.356 --> 42:11.689
Now you shall be reborn.

42:14.000 --> 42:20.000
