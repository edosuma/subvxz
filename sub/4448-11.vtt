21:51.893 --> 21:54.646
MM, THIS RIGHT HERE
IS CREAM PUFF.

21:54.730 --> 21:56.481
‐ YOU BROUGHT ME A BIRD.

21:56.565 --> 21:57.441
‐ HELL NO.
IT'S NOT FOR YOU.

21:57.524 --> 21:58.442
IT'S FOR YOUR MOM.

21:58.525 --> 22:00.068
‐ SHE COULD USE SOME COMPANY.

22:00.193 --> 22:01.820
MAYBE IT WILL GET HER OFF
MY BACK.

22:01.903 --> 22:04.197
BEEN A LONG TIME, MAN.

22:04.281 --> 22:05.782
WHERE YOU BEEN HIDDEN AWAY?

22:05.824 --> 22:07.409
‐ WELL, YOU KNOW,
I GOT INTO SOME TROUBLE,

22:07.451 --> 22:08.952
GOT OUT OF IT,
NOW I'M LOOKING FOR WORK.

22:08.994 --> 22:10.829
‐ WELL, YOU WERE ALWAYS GOOD
WITH A SHOTGUN.

22:10.912 --> 22:12.247
‐ HEY, PUT ME IN, COACH.

22:12.289 --> 22:15.000
‐ I'LL GIVE YOU A CALL
NEXT WEEK, HUH?

22:15.083 --> 22:16.043
‐ AH, NEXT WEEK.

22:16.084 --> 22:17.419
YOU DON'T GOT ANYTHING SOONER?

22:17.461 --> 22:19.087
‐ [scoffs]

22:21.048 --> 22:22.090
WHAT'S SO URGENT?

22:23.550 --> 22:24.843
‐ YOU REMEMBER MY GIRL?

22:24.926 --> 22:28.221
‐ LISA, RIGHT?
‐ YEAH, I LOST HER.

22:28.263 --> 22:29.431
YOU KNOW,
I'VE BEEN AWAY SO LONG.

22:29.514 --> 22:30.599
YOU KNOW HOW IT IS.

22:30.641 --> 22:31.767
IF I CAN GET FLUSH REAL QUICK,

22:31.850 --> 22:33.060
MAYBE I CAN GET HER BACK,
THOUGH.

22:33.101 --> 22:35.145
‐ SAME OLD PAUL.

22:35.187 --> 22:37.272
BALLS TO THE WALL.

22:37.314 --> 22:39.816
YEAH, I COULD USE YOU
FOR THIS ONE THING.

22:39.900 --> 22:40.984
I NEED OTHER GUY, THOUGH.

22:41.026 --> 22:43.070
‐ OH, HEY, ANOTHER GUY,
NO PROBLEM.

22:43.153 --> 22:44.821
ONE BEEFY BADASS
COMING UP RIGHT UP.

22:44.863 --> 22:47.157
[touch‐tones beeping]

22:47.240 --> 22:50.077
‐ HA, I'M SO HAPPY TO HAVE
THIS THING OFF.

22:50.160 --> 22:51.870
I FORGOT HOW SWEATY IT GETS.

22:51.953 --> 22:53.789
‐ HOW MANY TIMES HAVE YOU
USED THAT THING?

22:53.830 --> 22:55.165
‐ THREE,
FOUR TIMES PROFESSIONALLY.

22:55.207 --> 22:56.208
‐ PROFESSIONALLY.

22:56.291 --> 22:58.293
‐ YEAH,
AND ONE TIME PERSONALLY.

22:58.335 --> 22:59.711
‐ YOU USED THAT THING
WITH A GUY?

22:59.795 --> 23:01.421
‐ YEAH,
I HAD TO BREAK UP WITH HIM,

23:01.463 --> 23:02.798
AND I AM NOT THE BAD GUY,
OKAY,

23:02.839 --> 23:05.008
BECAUSE HE RAN HIS ASS OFF
WHEN HE SAW ME.

23:05.092 --> 23:06.843
‐ OKAY.

23:06.927 --> 23:08.970
‐ DO WANT TO DITCH THIS CASE
AND GO TO DISNEYLAND,

23:09.012 --> 23:10.722
'CAUSE WE COULD GET TO ALL
THE FRONT OF THE RIDES

23:10.806 --> 23:12.224
WITH THIS BAD BOY.

23:12.307 --> 23:14.393
‐ I'M TEMPTED,
BUT WE'RE HERE.

23:14.476 --> 23:17.104
AND SO ARE BRIGGS AND JAKES.

23:17.187 --> 23:18.522
‐ THAT IS NOT A GOOD SIGN.

23:21.191 --> 23:22.526
HOW DO YOU WANT TO HANDLE THIS?

23:33.662 --> 23:35.789
[knocking]

23:39.835 --> 23:41.586
‐ HEY.

23:41.670 --> 23:44.047
‐ IS BRIGGS INSIDE?

23:44.131 --> 23:46.174
‐ YEAH.

23:46.216 --> 23:47.676
‐ THIS ABOUT THE PARROT CASE?

23:47.759 --> 23:49.845
‐ KIND OF MADE A PIT STOP.

23:49.886 --> 23:51.430
[cell phone chiming]

23:55.350 --> 23:57.269
‐ AH.

23:57.352 --> 23:58.895
OH, THAT SHOULD BE MY MAN.

24:08.655 --> 24:11.199
‐ I THOUGHT YOU SAID "BADASS,"
NOT "BOY BAND."

24:11.241 --> 24:12.909
‐ WELL, THAT'S THE POINT.

24:12.951 --> 24:14.536
HE SURPRISES PEOPLE.

24:14.578 --> 24:16.705
YOU NEVER SEE HIM COMING
UNTIL IT'S TOO LATE.

24:16.747 --> 24:18.623
‐ I TRY MY BEST.

24:21.710 --> 24:23.003
‐ ALL RIGHT, THEN.

24:23.044 --> 24:24.504
WE GOT A CREW.

24:24.546 --> 24:26.548
WE'LL HIT THE PLACE TOMORROW,
STANDARD SMASH AND GRAB.

24:26.631 --> 24:28.383
YOU KNOW THE DRILL.

24:28.467 --> 24:29.509
‐ WHAT'S THE TARGET?

24:29.551 --> 24:31.344
I'LL LET YOU KNOW TOMORROW.

24:31.386 --> 24:33.972
MEET ME ON THE CORNER
OF 11TH AND BERENDO, NOON.

24:34.055 --> 24:36.808
‐ WE'LL BE THERE.

24:36.892 --> 24:38.226
THANKS FOR THE LONG JOHNS.

24:38.268 --> 24:39.895
YOU KNOW, IT'S FUNNY
THAT YOUR CUSTOMS JOB

24:39.936 --> 24:41.605
HAPPENS TO INTERSECT
WITH MY INVESTIGATION.

24:41.688 --> 24:42.773
‐ CUT THE CRAP, MIKE.

24:42.856 --> 24:44.065
YOU ALMOST BLEW MY COVER
IN THERE.

24:44.107 --> 24:45.734
THANK GOD I DIDN'T TELL HIM YOU
WERE BLACK.

24:45.776 --> 24:46.860
‐ WAIT A MINUTE.
THIS IS NOW MY FAULT?

24:46.943 --> 24:48.069
‐ YOU KNOW WHAT, MAN?

24:48.111 --> 24:49.279
YOU'RE SERIOUSLY ABOUT
TO BLOW THIS.

24:49.362 --> 24:50.363
THEY COULD BE WATCHING US.
COME HERE, MAN.

24:50.447 --> 24:51.865
‐ OKAY,
YOU SPECIFICALLY TOLD ME

24:51.948 --> 24:53.408
THAT YOU WERE GONNA STAY AWAY
FROM THIS,

24:53.450 --> 24:55.577
AND NOW I FIND YOU WITH THE GUY
WHO STOLE JUAN'S CAR.

24:55.619 --> 24:57.078
‐ OF COURSE I'M LOOKING
FOR THE CAR.

24:57.120 --> 24:57.996
‐ YOU LIED.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

24:58.079 --> 24:59.206
YOU'VE BEEN LYING FOR MONTHS.

24:59.289 --> 25:00.749
COME DECEMBER,
WE'LL BE EVEN.

25:00.791 --> 25:01.917
‐ I'M SICK OF THIS SH‐‐, MAN.

25:02.000 --> 25:03.585
‐ I AM TIRED OF IT TOO.

25:03.627 --> 25:05.086
SOMEBODY HAS IT IN FOR ME,

25:05.128 --> 25:06.713
ENOUGH TO PULL STRINGS
TO PUT YOU INTO GRACELAND

25:06.755 --> 25:07.923
TO INVESTIGATE ME,

25:08.006 --> 25:09.007
ENOUGH TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE
I KILLED A GUY

25:09.090 --> 25:10.550
I'D NEVER EVEN HEARD OF.

25:10.592 --> 25:12.928
‐ YOU THINK SOMEONE'S TRYING
TO FRAME YOU.

25:12.969 --> 25:14.888
‐ MAN, I THINK SOMEONE IS TRYING
TO BURY ME,

25:14.930 --> 25:16.389
AND I'M NOT GONNA HAND THEM
THE SHOVEL.

25:16.431 --> 25:18.433
I MEAN, LOOK, YOU TOLD ME ABOUT
YOU'RE INVESTIGATION,

25:18.517 --> 25:19.976
DIDN'T YOU?

25:20.060 --> 25:22.270
CLEARLY YOU HAVE YOUR OWN DOUBTS
ABOUT THE BUREAU RIGHT NOW.

25:22.312 --> 25:24.189
‐ YOU KNOW WHAT?

25:24.272 --> 25:26.024
I'M BELIEVE WHATEVER
IS ON THAT TAPE.

25:26.107 --> 25:28.151
TOMORROW CLAYTON IS GONNA
PICK US UP IN THE GETAWAY CAR,

25:28.193 --> 25:29.486
JUAN'S CAR.

25:29.569 --> 25:31.988
WE GET THE CAR,
I GET THE TAPE,

25:32.072 --> 25:33.281
AND THEN I'M GONNA KNOW
THE TRUTH.

25:33.323 --> 25:34.324
‐ YES, YOU WILL.

25:40.914 --> 25:41.873
‐ YO.

25:41.957 --> 25:43.625
‐ HOW'S THE PATIENT?

25:43.667 --> 25:46.461
‐ GONE,
NEVER HAD A CHANCE.

25:46.503 --> 25:50.131
SO WE EACH OWE 100,
PLUS ANOTHER 400

25:50.173 --> 25:52.259
FOR THE TIME I KEPT IT
WHILE I WAS TRYING TO FIX IT.

25:52.300 --> 25:53.718
[laughs]

25:53.802 --> 25:54.970
‐ WHATEVER.

25:55.011 --> 25:56.847
REMEMBER THIS PRICK QUINN?

25:56.930 --> 25:58.932
‐ YEAH, YOU REALLY HATE
THAT DUDE, DON'T YA?

25:58.974 --> 26:00.141
‐ NO,
I'D REALLY HATE MYSELF MORE

26:00.225 --> 26:01.726
IF I LET HIM GET AWAY AGAIN.

26:01.810 --> 26:03.937
‐ QUINN'S BACK IN TOWN,
AND HE'S GOT A NEW SUPPLIER,

26:04.020 --> 26:05.272
SO HE AIN'T GOING ANYWHERE.

26:05.355 --> 26:07.357
AND YOU KNOW HOW MUCH BAD GUYS
LOVE TO PARTY.

26:07.399 --> 26:08.316
‐ SO WHAT'S MY PLAY?

26:08.358 --> 26:09.568
‐ YOU.

26:09.651 --> 26:11.236
‐ ME?
‐ THIS.

26:11.319 --> 26:12.779
YOU KNOW THAT BOY'S
GOT A THING FOR YOU.

26:12.863 --> 26:14.531
‐ HE'S NOT INTO ME, HONEY.
HE'S INTO KATIE.

26:14.573 --> 26:16.533
‐ YOU ARE KATIE,
SO WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?

26:16.616 --> 26:17.534
‐ SHE'S A JUNKIE.

26:17.617 --> 26:18.910
‐ [laughs]

26:18.994 --> 26:20.829
NO OFFENSE, BUT I DON'T THINK
HE'S INTO KATIE

26:20.871 --> 26:22.330
FOR HER PERSONALITY.

26:22.372 --> 26:24.958
IT'S GOOD YOU GOT BRIGGS THERE,
THOUGH, FOR A COCK BLOCK.

26:25.000 --> 26:27.168
‐ NO, KATIE DOESN'T NEED ERIC
ON THIS ONE.

26:27.210 --> 26:28.503
‐ REALLY?

26:28.545 --> 26:30.338
‐ YEAH, THEY ALMOST CAME
TO BLOWS THE LAST TIME.

26:30.380 --> 26:31.882
‐ SO YOU WOULDN'T HAVE TO
SHOOT UP.

26:31.965 --> 26:33.842
‐ THEY HAVE TOO MUCH BAGGAGE.
‐ AND THE TWO OF YOU DON'T?

26:33.925 --> 26:35.343
‐ IT'S DIFFERENT.

26:35.427 --> 26:37.637
OH, COME ON.

26:37.679 --> 26:39.514
LIKE THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH YOU THINKING BRIGGS

26:39.598 --> 26:41.182
MIGHT BE ODIN?

26:41.224 --> 26:42.392
I'D BE YOUR NEW PARTNER,

26:42.475 --> 26:44.227
EXCEPT I ALREADY SPOOKED
THE DUDE OFF.

26:44.311 --> 26:46.938
‐ I CAN TAKE CARE OF MYSELF,
THANKS.

26:47.022 --> 26:49.024
‐ LIKE YOU DID LAST TIME,
WHEN YOU SHOT UP?

26:49.065 --> 26:50.442
‐ THAT'LL NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN,
JOHNNY.

26:50.525 --> 26:51.902
‐ DAMN RIGHT IT WON'T.

26:51.943 --> 26:53.695
LOOK, THERE AIN'T NO WAY
I'M LETTING YOU MEET

26:53.737 --> 26:54.738
WITH QUINN BY YOURSELF.

26:54.779 --> 26:55.906
IT AIN'T GONNA HAPPEN.

26:55.947 --> 26:57.198
‐ LOOK,
I'M GONNA GET A NEW PARTNER.

26:57.240 --> 26:58.992
I ACTUALLY HAVE SOMEONE IN MIND.

26:59.075 --> 27:00.535
‐ WHO?

27:00.577 --> 27:02.495
‐ HE'S BEEN UNDERCOVER BEFORE.
YOU NEVER MET HIM.

27:02.579 --> 27:04.080
‐ NEVER MET HIM,
OR HE DOESN'T EXIST?

27:04.122 --> 27:05.290
‐ DO YOU TRUST ME OR NOT?

27:05.373 --> 27:08.543
‐ [sighs]

27:08.627 --> 27:11.254
ALL RIGHT,
I'LL LET YOU GET TO IT.

27:11.338 --> 27:13.548
‐ THANK YOU.

27:18.511 --> 27:21.014
‐ I HATE THIS.

27:21.056 --> 27:23.642
EVERY SINGLE TIME I SEE PAUL,
I HAVE TO PUT ON THIS ACT.

27:23.725 --> 27:25.268
‐ SORRY I DRAGGED YOU INTO THIS.

27:25.352 --> 27:26.770
‐ WELL,
I DRAGGED MYSELF.

27:26.853 --> 27:29.105
I WANT TO KNOW THE TRUTH NOW
AS MUCH AS YOU.

27:29.147 --> 27:32.150
YEAH, NOW THE QUESTION IS...
DOES BRIGGS?

27:32.233 --> 27:34.444
A PERSON DESERVES THE RIGHT
TO CLEAR THEIR OWN NAME.

27:34.527 --> 27:36.112
‐ YEAH,
AND BRIGGS IS ALWAYS ARMED

27:36.154 --> 27:37.614
WITH A PERFECTLY REASONABLE
ARGUMENT.

27:37.656 --> 27:38.907
‐ YOU DON'T BELIEVE HIM?

27:40.450 --> 27:41.951
‐ I DON'T TRUST HIM.

27:42.035 --> 27:43.453
‐ MIKE'S NOT GONNA LET ME
OUT OF HIS SIGHT AGAIN, MAN.

27:43.536 --> 27:45.121
I KNOW IT.

27:45.205 --> 27:47.123
I'VE GOT NO CHOICE, MAN.
I HAVE TO GO THROUGH WITH IT.

27:47.165 --> 27:48.917
‐ YOU'RE NOT GONNA WAVE
THE WHITE FLAG.

27:48.958 --> 27:52.379
‐ NO, MAN, I JUST‐‐I NEED TIME,
YOU KNOW.

27:52.420 --> 27:53.755
[sighs]

27:53.838 --> 27:55.048
LOOK,
WHEN THE TAC TEAM SHOWS UP,

27:55.090 --> 27:56.508
YOU'VE GOT TO TAKE DOWN
ME AND MIKE

27:56.591 --> 27:58.343
IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN OUR COVERS
WITH CLAYTON.

27:58.426 --> 28:00.595
‐ YEAH...
‐ GRAB MIKE FIRST.

28:00.679 --> 28:02.764
‐ THE ONE THING I LEARNED
FROM INVESTIGATING BRIGGS IS,

28:02.806 --> 28:04.557
YOU DON'T PAY ATTENTION
TO ANYTHING HE SAYS.

28:04.599 --> 28:06.059
YOU PAY ATTENTION
TO WHAT HE DOES.

28:07.686 --> 28:09.771
‐ JOHNNY IS RIGHT.

28:09.813 --> 28:11.356
THIS HOUSE IS FALLING APART.

28:13.316 --> 28:15.485
AND THE QUESTION IS,
IS IT'S BRIGGS' FAULT‐‐

28:15.527 --> 28:16.653
‐ OR IS IT MINE?

28:18.321 --> 28:19.823
I GUESS WE'LL FIND OUT TOMORROW.

28:19.906 --> 28:22.575
‐ ALL I NEED
IS A TEN‐SECOND WINDOW, JAKES.

28:22.659 --> 28:24.119
THAT'S NOT GONNA BUY YOU
A LOT OF TIME, BRIGGS.

28:24.160 --> 28:25.537
‐ IT'S ENOUGH TIME
TO GET INTO THAT CAR

28:25.620 --> 28:27.330
AND DESTROY WHATEVER RECORDING
MIGHT EXIST.

28:27.414 --> 28:29.582
‐ AND IT'S GONNA MAKE YOU LOOK
REAL GUILTY.

28:29.666 --> 28:34.295
‐ NOT AS GUILTY AS A RECORDING
OF A MURDER, ACCIDENT OR NOT,

28:34.337 --> 28:38.591
COME ON, DJ., TEN SECONDS.

28:38.633 --> 28:40.301
‐ YOU'LL HAVE IT.

28:40.385 --> 28:43.513
‐ OH, THANK YOU.

28:48.268 --> 28:50.186
‐ THEY GONNA SHOW?

28:50.270 --> 28:51.646
‐ MAYBE YOU SPOOKED 'EM.

28:51.688 --> 28:53.398
‐ [scoffs]

28:53.481 --> 28:54.858
‐ MIKE,
IN ALL MY YEARS OF DOING THIS,

28:54.941 --> 28:57.235
I'VE NEVER MET
A PUNCTUAL BAD GUY.

28:57.318 --> 28:58.862
‐ ALL RIGHT,
I'M GONNA TAKE MIKE AND BRIGGS.

28:58.903 --> 29:00.447
YOU AND THE TEAM GET THE REST.

29:00.572 --> 29:02.824
‐ WOW, YOU'RE REALLY STICKING
YOUR NECK OUT THERE, HUH?

29:02.866 --> 29:04.117
‐ I DON'T HALF‐ASS THIS,
ALL RIGHT?

29:04.200 --> 29:05.702
I SELL IT:

29:05.744 --> 29:07.871
TACKLING 'EM TO THE GROUND,
SLAPPING ON THE CUFFS,

29:07.912 --> 29:09.497
THROWING 'EM IN THE BACK
OF THE SQUAD CAR,

29:09.539 --> 29:11.332
LIKE SOME <i>STARSKY & HUTCH</i> TYPE
SH‐‐, OKAY?

29:11.416 --> 29:13.752
‐ GREAT, WELL, YOU BE WWE,
WHILE WE'RE MMA.

29:13.835 --> 29:15.128
‐ I'M HERE, RIGHT?

29:15.170 --> 29:17.505
Y'ALL WANT ME TO STEP UP;
THIS IS ME STEPPING UP.

29:17.547 --> 29:19.048
‐ I THINK THE IDEA WAS YOU
WANTING TO BE A PART

29:19.132 --> 29:20.842
OF THE HOUSE‐‐

29:20.925 --> 29:23.511
‐ JUST CAUSE I KEEP TO MYSELF
DOESN'T MEAN I'M AN ASSHOLE.

29:23.595 --> 29:25.680
‐ I KNOW.

29:25.764 --> 29:28.850
‐ AND WHEN I DO STICK
MY NECK OUT, THIS SH‐‐ HAPPENS.

29:30.351 --> 29:32.729
WHATEVER THE HELL THIS IS.

29:32.771 --> 29:34.230
ALL RIGHT,
Y'ALL BE READY TO ROLL.

29:39.402 --> 29:41.070
‐ HEY, NOW.
NICE RIDE.

29:41.154 --> 29:43.364
‐ GET IN.
‐ ISN'T THIS A LITTLE MUCH?

29:43.406 --> 29:44.783
‐ THAT'S THE POINT DUMBASS.

29:44.866 --> 29:46.242
THEY'LL STILL BE LOOKING
FOR THIS ONE

29:46.284 --> 29:48.953
WHILE WE GET AWAY
IN THE SWITCH‐OUT CAR.

29:49.037 --> 29:50.830
‐ WHAT'S THE SWITCH‐OUT CAR
LOOK LIKE?

29:50.914 --> 29:53.082
‐ I DON'T EVEN REMEMBER;
IT'S SO BORING.

29:53.166 --> 29:57.712
SOME CROWN VIC OR SOMETHING.

29:59.214 --> 30:00.215
‐ ALL RIGHT,
TAKE 'EM DOWN NOW.

30:00.298 --> 30:01.674
‐ HOLD ON.

30:01.716 --> 30:03.843
‐ IF WE ARREST THEM,
THEY BRING US THE OTHER CAR.

30:03.885 --> 30:05.345
‐ YEAH,
OR THEY KEEP THEIR TRAPS SHUT,

30:05.386 --> 30:07.138
AND YOU NEVER FIND THE TRUTH.

30:07.222 --> 30:08.169
‐ YOU'RE RIGHT.

30:08.169 --> 30:08.776
‐ COME ON.

30:19.442 --> 30:22.487
‐ HEY, THANKS FOR MEETING ME
ON SUCH SHORT NOTICE.

30:22.570 --> 30:23.947
‐ THANK YOU FOR BEING ON TIME.

30:24.030 --> 30:25.907
THERE'S NOTHING WORSE
THAN A MAN DRINKING ALONE.

30:25.949 --> 30:27.617
‐ RAFAEL,
I NEED YOUR HELP.

30:27.659 --> 30:29.828
‐ OH,
THAT'S WHAT I'M HERE FOR.

30:29.911 --> 30:31.621
‐ QUINN KNOWS ME AS A JUNKIE
NAMED KATIE,

30:31.663 --> 30:33.456
KATIE HAS A PARTNER NAMED ERIC,

30:33.540 --> 30:35.375
WHO'S STUCK ON A CASE
IN THE EAST COAST,

30:35.416 --> 30:36.918
‐ AND YOU DON'T WANT TO WAIT.
‐ NO.

30:37.001 --> 30:39.003
I'M NOT GONNA TAKE A CHANCE
OF LOSING QUINN AGAIN,

30:39.087 --> 30:41.506
SO I NEED A NEW PARTNER.

30:41.589 --> 30:43.383
‐ I HAVEN'T BEEN UNDERCOVER
IN A WHILE.

30:43.424 --> 30:44.717
‐ LOOK, QUINN'S GOT A BEEF
WITH ODIN,

30:44.759 --> 30:45.927
'CAUSE HE CUT OFF HIS SUPPLY.

30:46.010 --> 30:47.804
I DOUBT WE'LL HAVE TO TWIST
HIS ARM.

30:47.887 --> 30:50.223
IT SHOULD BE EASY,
IN AND OUT.

30:52.559 --> 30:53.977
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
‐ WHAT'S UP?

30:54.060 --> 30:55.395
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M DOING.

30:55.478 --> 30:56.646
‐ DID YOU FOLLOW ME?

30:56.729 --> 30:58.481
‐ YOU HOW DOING, MAN?
I'M JOHNNY.

30:58.565 --> 30:59.566
WHO THE HELL ARE YOU?

30:59.649 --> 31:01.693
‐ AGENT CORTES.
HE'S A FEDERALE.

31:02.986 --> 31:03.903
‐ A FEDERALE?

31:03.987 --> 31:05.363
‐ YEAH.

31:05.446 --> 31:07.991
‐ DAMN, GIRL, NO WONDER YOU BEEN
KEEPING THIS ON THE LOW.

31:08.074 --> 31:10.577
‐ YEAH, BECAUSE I WAS AFRAID
OF THIS EXACT REACTION.

31:10.660 --> 31:11.828
‐ YOU SHOULD BE.

31:11.870 --> 31:13.329
NOT THAT I DON'T TRUST
MEXICANS, BRO.

31:13.413 --> 31:15.081
JUST..I DON'T TRUST
HIS KIND OF MEXICANS.

31:15.164 --> 31:16.082
[laughs]

31:16.124 --> 31:18.293
‐ PERHAPS I SHOULD WAIT OUTSIDE.

31:18.334 --> 31:20.044
‐ YEAH.
‐ NO. NO.

31:20.128 --> 31:22.005
AGENT CORTES HAS BEEN
CHASING JANGLES FOR YEARS.

31:22.088 --> 31:24.007
I NEED SOMEBODY TO BOUNCE
THIS STUFF OFF OF.

31:24.090 --> 31:25.800
‐ YOU COULDN'T HAVE KEPT THIS
MORE IN‐HOUSE?

31:25.884 --> 31:28.219
‐ NO, BECAUSE NOBODY IN‐HOUSE
WOULD LISTEN TO ME.

31:28.303 --> 31:30.305
‐ I LISTENED TO YOU, OKAY? I
JUST DIDN'T AGREE WITH YOU.

31:30.388 --> 31:32.056
‐ SO WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST TRUST
MY INSTINCTS?

31:32.140 --> 31:33.808
‐ YOUR INSTINCTS? FOR REAL?
‐ YEAH. YEAH.

31:33.850 --> 31:35.310
‐ THE SAME INSTINCTS THAT HAVE
GOT YOU WORKING WITH SOME DUDE

31:35.393 --> 31:36.603
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW?

31:36.686 --> 31:39.230
‐ I HAVE BEEN A FEDERALE
FOR 12 YEARS.

31:39.314 --> 31:41.816
YOU MAY NOT RESPECT MY EMPLOYER,

31:41.858 --> 31:44.110
BUT YOU SHOULD RESPECT
HOW DIFFICULT MY JOB IS.

31:44.193 --> 31:46.571
BEEN CHASING THE CARTELS
FOR SO LONG.

31:46.654 --> 31:48.364
I MUST HAVE LEARNED SOMETHING.

31:48.406 --> 31:50.658
‐ YEAH,
LIKE HOW TO LOOK THE OTHER WAY.

31:50.700 --> 31:52.035
‐ CHARLIE KNOWS WHOSE SIDE
I'M ON.

31:52.076 --> 31:53.536
‐ WHO'S SIDE IS THAT, BRO?

31:55.204 --> 31:56.080
‐ HERS.

31:58.166 --> 31:59.542
‐ YOU GONNA HELP OR NOT,
JOHNNY?

32:07.800 --> 32:09.135
‐ ALL RIGHT.

32:16.309 --> 32:18.645
[tires squealing]

32:18.728 --> 32:19.854
‐ THERE IT IS.

32:19.896 --> 32:22.774
‐ SHOULDN'T WE KICK BACK
AFTER THE JOB?

32:22.857 --> 32:25.026
‐ YOU THINK WE WERE ROBBING
A BANK OR SOMETHING?

32:25.068 --> 32:27.236
DUDE, NO MASSAGE PARLOR
IN THIS PART OF TOWN

32:27.320 --> 32:29.072
JUST GIVES MASSAGES.

32:29.155 --> 32:31.199
‐ SO WHAT, ARE WE HOLDING THEM
UP FOR A HAND JOB OR WHAT?

32:31.240 --> 32:34.285
‐ IT'S AN ALL‐CASH BUSINESS:
BIG TURNOVER, LOW SECURITY.

32:34.369 --> 32:35.411
‐ YEAH, NO CAMERAS.

32:35.453 --> 32:36.663
DON'T WANT TO SCARE OFF
THE JOHNS.

32:36.746 --> 32:37.789
‐ NO ALARMS, EITHER.

32:37.872 --> 32:38.915
‐ THE LAST THING
THIS PLACE WANTS

32:38.998 --> 32:40.249
IS THE COPS SHOWING UP.

32:40.333 --> 32:43.086
‐ OH, SEEMS LIKE YOU KNOW
THE PLACE PRETTY WELL.

32:43.169 --> 32:45.672
‐ I DONE MY HOMEWORK.
‐ [laughs]

32:45.713 --> 32:47.173
RODNEY HERE IS HITTING THE SAFE.

32:47.215 --> 32:49.550
I WANT YOU TWO ON CROWD CONTROL.

32:49.592 --> 32:51.427
A SAWED‐OFF SHOTGUN.

32:51.511 --> 32:53.429
JUST THE WAY YOU LIKE IT.

32:53.513 --> 32:56.599
‐ NICE BITCH, AND HERE I DIDN'T
GET YOU ANYTHING.

32:56.683 --> 32:58.434
‐ HEY, DON'T FORGET TO ROB
THE JOHNS TOO.

32:58.518 --> 33:00.269
‐ OH, YEAH.
THEY GOT IT COMING.

33:00.353 --> 33:02.772
‐ YEP.
‐ HEY...

33:02.855 --> 33:04.357
THIS WILL GET LISA BACK.

33:13.616 --> 33:15.493
‐ THEY'RE NOT ACTUALLY GONNA
GO THROUGH WITH THIS.

33:15.576 --> 33:17.120
‐ WELL,
THEY'VE GOT TO LET IT PLAY OUT.

33:17.203 --> 33:19.455
‐ WOW, YOU KNOW, YOU'RE STARTING
TO SOUND LIKE BRIGGS.

33:19.539 --> 33:21.457
I'M THE LAST PERSON
TO BE TAKING SIDES

33:21.541 --> 33:23.292
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE
COYLY SUGGESTING.

33:23.376 --> 33:26.587
I DON'T GOT SKIN IN THIS GAME,
AND NEITHER SHOULD YOU.

33:26.629 --> 33:27.880
‐ KNOCK‐KNOCK.

33:27.922 --> 33:29.257
‐ YES,
THIS IS WHAT YOU THINK IT IS.

33:29.340 --> 33:30.675
‐ WHERE'S THE SAFE?
‐ ON THE FLOOR.

33:30.758 --> 33:31.843
‐ NO MORE MASSAGES TODAY.

33:31.926 --> 33:33.386
‐ YO, GET TO THE BACK, OLD MAN.

33:33.428 --> 33:35.680
YEAH, YOU TOO.

33:35.763 --> 33:37.598

‐ OKAY, EVERYBODY ON THE FLOOR.

33:42.854 --> 33:44.272
LET'S GO.

33:44.313 --> 33:46.607
‐ GET YOUR HEADS ON THE GROUND
AND YOUR HANDS IN THE AIR.

‐ ALL RIGHT,
THOSE OF YOU WITH PANTS ON,

33:48.192 --> 33:50.737
PLEASE TAKE OUT YOUR WALLETS
AND MAKE A DEPOSIT.

33:50.820 --> 33:52.030
BE QUICK ABOUT IT.
LET'S GO.

33:52.113 --> 33:53.656
LET'S GO.

33:53.698 --> 33:55.491
‐ ALL RIGHT,
LET'S ROLL.

33:58.244 --> 33:59.746
‐ NOW, REMEMBER,
NO SENSE CALLING THE COPS

33:59.829 --> 34:01.080
ONCE WE'RE GONE.

34:01.164 --> 34:02.832
IF WE WEREN'T HERE,
NEITHER WERE YOU.

34:02.915 --> 34:05.710
[handcuffs click]

34:05.793 --> 34:07.503
‐ WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
‐ YOU SHOULDN'T BE HERE.

34:07.587 --> 34:09.005
‐ YEAH, NO SH‐‐.

34:09.088 --> 34:10.256
‐ WHAT ARE YOU TWO UP TO?

34:10.298 --> 34:11.674
‐ WHY DON'T YOU ASK YOUR BOY?

34:11.758 --> 34:12.967
‐ TAKE THESE THINGS OFF ME.
‐ CAN'T DO IT, MAN.

34:13.051 --> 34:14.677
YOU'VE BEEN PLAYING AN ANGLE
THE WHOLE TIME.

34:14.761 --> 34:15.928
‐ THE HELL I HAVE.

34:15.970 --> 34:17.972
I AM NOT GONNA ASK AGAIN‐‐

34:18.056 --> 34:19.390
‐ BRIGGS, BRIGGS,
IF YOU'RE INNOCENT,

34:19.474 --> 34:20.767
LET ME PROVE IT, OKAY?

34:20.808 --> 34:24.103
IF YOU'RE NOT,
YOU BETTER SHOOT ME RIGHT NOW.

34:25.772 --> 34:27.648
‐ SORRY, MAN.

34:27.690 --> 34:30.526
‐ NO, YOU'RE NOT.

34:35.698 --> 34:37.658
‐ WHAT HAPPENED TO
NOT TAKING SIDES?

34:37.700 --> 34:39.535
‐ WHAT HAPPENED TO NOT HAVING
SKIN IN THE GAME?

34:39.577 --> 34:40.995
‐ THIS IS A JOKE.

34:41.037 --> 34:42.997
[engine turning over]

34:43.039 --> 34:44.332
‐ DUDE, GO. GO. GO.

34:44.373 --> 34:45.583

‐ I DON'T KNOW.

34:45.666 --> 34:46.709
HE WAS GRABBING WALLETS,
AND SOME GUY

PUNCHED HIM IN THE FACE.

34:47.877 --> 34:48.920

34:57.095 --> 34:59.472
‐ MOVE! BACK!

34:59.514 --> 35:02.308
‐ I UNDERESTIMATED HIM.

35:02.350 --> 35:04.060
‐ YOU DON'T DANCE
WITH THE CHAMP.

35:04.143 --> 35:05.019
YOU KNOCK HIM OUT.

35:05.144 --> 35:06.229
‐ WHAT?

35:06.270 --> 35:07.563
‐ [sighs]

35:07.647 --> 35:09.065
HE DIDN'T WAIT FOR ME
TO MAKE MY MOVE, DJ.

35:09.107 --> 35:10.316
HE THREW A SUCKER PUNCH.

35:10.400 --> 35:11.609
IT'S EXACTLY WHAT I
WOULD HAVE DONE.

35:11.692 --> 35:12.944
‐ HE'S WEARING THE WIRE, RIGHT?

35:13.027 --> 35:14.320
WE TRACK THE GPS.
MAYBE BEAT HIM TO THE CAR.

35:14.404 --> 35:15.738
‐ NOW,
THEY KNOW WHERE THEY'RE GOING.

35:15.822 --> 35:17.198
WE DON'T.

35:17.240 --> 35:18.908
THERE'S NO WAY I BEAT HIM
TO THAT RECORDER NOW.

35:18.991 --> 35:20.243
HE WON.
I LOST.

35:20.284 --> 35:21.744
‐ ALL RIGHT,
SO WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

35:21.786 --> 35:23.579
‐ GET A HEAD START.

35:23.663 --> 35:25.081
‐ HEAD START ON WHAT?

35:25.164 --> 35:26.749
‐ THE REST OF MY LIFE.

35:39.095 --> 35:41.639
‐ ASK ME NO QUESTIONS.
YOU BEEN TO ONE OF THESE?

35:41.723 --> 35:43.766
‐ RELAX.
EVERYBODY ELSE IS.

35:43.850 --> 35:46.102
‐ I'M WALKING OUT, AND WE'VE GOT
JOHNNY OUTSIDE FOR BACKUP.

35:46.144 --> 35:47.270
‐ FRICKIN' RIGHT.

35:47.312 --> 35:48.813
I'M AN ARMY OF ONE.

35:48.896 --> 35:50.189
‐ [coughs]

35:50.273 --> 35:52.317
‐ IF WE TAKE A LOOK
AT OUR RECENT WEATHER MAP,

35:52.400 --> 35:54.944
WE CAN SEE THAT UPPER LEVEL
OF HIGH PRESSURE

35:55.028 --> 35:59.866
HOVERING JUST OFF
THE BAJA PENINSULA, AND THAT...

35:59.949 --> 36:03.620
‐ MAY I?

36:03.661 --> 36:04.829
SUCH A GENTLEMAN.

36:04.912 --> 36:06.456
‐ WE BOTH KNOW
THAT'S NOT THE CASE.

36:06.539 --> 36:08.374
‐ THIS IS MY PARTNER RAFAEL.

36:08.416 --> 36:09.375
‐ WHAT HAPPENED TO ERIC?

36:09.417 --> 36:10.918
‐ HE'S DOING HIS OWN THING.

36:11.002 --> 36:12.587
‐ I GOT TIRED OF HIM.

36:12.629 --> 36:13.921
I BET YOU DID TOO.

36:13.963 --> 36:15.423
‐ WE WEREN'T IN A RELATIONSHIP.

36:15.506 --> 36:16.841
‐ YEAH.

36:16.924 --> 36:19.761
YEAH, YOU SAY THAT,
BUT LAST TIME I SAW YOU TWO,

36:19.802 --> 36:21.846
YOU WERE GOING AT IT
PRETTY HOT AND HEAVY.

36:21.929 --> 36:23.389
‐ THAT'S NOT HOW I REMEMBER IT.

36:23.431 --> 36:25.058
‐ YOU WERE HIGH, KATIE.

36:25.099 --> 36:26.851
‐ WHAT A DICK, MAN.

36:26.934 --> 36:28.811
‐ YEAH, PARTNERS BREAK UP
ALL THE TIME, RIGHT?

36:28.895 --> 36:30.897
LOOK AT YOU AND ODIN.

36:30.980 --> 36:32.607
MY NEW PARTNER HERE
CAN OFFER YOU SOMETHING

36:32.649 --> 36:35.318
TO GET A LITTLE PAYBACK
FROM YOUR LAST PARTNER.

36:35.401 --> 36:36.694
‐ HOW'S THAT?

36:36.778 --> 36:39.614
‐ WE WANT TO TAKE THE MILLIONS
HE GOT FROM BELLO.

36:39.656 --> 36:41.491
AND RAFAEL HERE HAS THE BAIT.

36:43.534 --> 36:45.662
‐ SO YOU ME TO DANGLE IT
IN FRONT OF ODIN.

36:45.703 --> 36:47.163
‐ I WANT YOU TO TEXT HIM.

36:47.205 --> 36:48.164
‐ WHAT'S THE BAIT?

36:48.247 --> 36:49.624
‐ JANGLES.

36:49.707 --> 36:51.626
‐ ODIN KNOWS JANGLES
IS AFTER HIM.

36:51.668 --> 36:53.336
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS TELL HIM
JANGLES IS HERE,

36:53.419 --> 36:54.754
AND HE'LL COME RUNNING.

36:54.796 --> 36:56.089
‐ ALONE.

36:56.130 --> 36:57.632
‐ ARE YOU HIGH?

36:57.674 --> 36:59.801
NOBODY COMES AFTER JANGLES
BY THEMSELVES.

36:59.842 --> 37:01.052
‐ ODIN DOESN'T HAVE AN ARMY.

37:01.135 --> 37:02.595
HE DOESN'T EVEN HAVE
ANY FRIENDS.

37:02.637 --> 37:05.640
‐ HE'S GOT A LOT OF MONEY, AND
THAT BUYS A LOT OF PROTECTION,

37:05.682 --> 37:07.266
NOT TO MENTION THE SH‐‐
I'M GONNA BE INTO

37:07.308 --> 37:08.726
IF JANGLES EVER FINDS OUT.

37:08.810 --> 37:10.478
‐ I DOUBT YOU'RE EVEN IN
HIS RADAR.

37:10.520 --> 37:11.646
‐ [laughs]

37:13.690 --> 37:15.692
YOU HAVE BAD TASTE IN PARTNERS.

37:15.775 --> 37:18.403
I HOPE YOU'RE NOT BANGING
THIS ONE TOO.

37:18.486 --> 37:20.488
‐ NAH,
WE'RE JUST FRIENDS.

37:20.530 --> 37:22.240
‐ JUST FRIENDS.

37:22.323 --> 37:24.283
WELL, IF HE'S YOUR FRIEND,
HE'LL DO WHAT'S BEST FOR YOU.

37:24.367 --> 37:25.535
‐ WHAT'S THAT?

37:25.618 --> 37:26.536
‐ TAKE A WALK.

37:29.831 --> 37:32.083
YOU UNDERSTAND ENGLISH, RAFAEL?

37:32.166 --> 37:34.168
‐ DO YOU?
‐ TAKE IT EASY.

37:34.252 --> 37:36.587
‐ I DON'T TALK BUSINESS
IN FRONT OF PEOPLE I DON'T KNOW.

37:36.671 --> 37:38.923
‐ I THOUGHT YOU WEREN'T
INTERESTED.

37:39.006 --> 37:40.633
‐ MAYBE YOU CAN CHANGE MY MIND.

37:40.675 --> 37:42.677
‐ WE CAN ALWAYS GO
TO SOMEONE ELSE.

37:42.719 --> 37:44.303
‐ YEAH?
THEY GOT ODIN'S NUMBER?

37:45.471 --> 37:46.806
‐ I'LL TAKE IT FROM HERE.

37:46.848 --> 37:48.349
‐ THE HELL YOU WILL.

37:48.391 --> 37:49.475
‐ I'LL BE OUTSIDE.

37:57.650 --> 37:59.652
GIVE US SOME PRIVACY,
RICK.

38:04.532 --> 38:06.909
‐ OKAY, SO LET'S TALK.

38:06.993 --> 38:08.161
‐ WHO SAID I WANTED TO TALK?

38:08.244 --> 38:09.746
‐ THIS IS HOW YOU DO BUSINESS?

38:09.829 --> 38:11.080
‐ SO DO YOU.

38:11.164 --> 38:13.040
REMEMBER THE LAST TIME
YOU WANTED TO MAKE A DEAL?
