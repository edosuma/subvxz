NARRATOR:
<i>Previously on </i>Hill Street Blues...

00:04.004 --> 00:06.589
Gina doesn't want me.
Henry doesn't want you.

00:06.965 --> 00:08.049
We're leftovers.

00:09.092 --> 00:10.218
Holy-moly.

00:10.301 --> 00:12.053
I said it would never happen again!

00:12.137 --> 00:13.722
I can get past the anger,

00:13.805 --> 00:16.391
but I can't get past the fact
that I'm scared to ride with you.

00:16.474 --> 00:19.227
This one cost us! It cost us in lawsuits--

00:19.310 --> 00:20.478
You know what else it cost you?

00:20.562 --> 00:22.814
Me. I quit.

00:22.897 --> 00:25.150
You would rather make me out
like some kind of aberration.

00:25.233 --> 00:27.819
I know it, and everybody
in this stinking place knows it!

00:27.902 --> 00:29.320
I think she's using something.

00:29.404 --> 00:30.572
That never occurred to me.

00:32.574 --> 00:35.660
(chattering)

00:35.744 --> 00:36.828
JABLONSKI: Item seven...

00:37.871 --> 00:39.330
Yeah. Item seven...

00:39.706 --> 00:43.752
Item seven is a hooker undercover
targeting gays and regular johns

00:44.210 --> 00:46.296
in the vicinity of Green and Sycamore.

00:46.379 --> 00:48.423
Now, this traffic has been moving eastward

00:48.506 --> 00:51.092
ever since they started building
the, uh, Dekker Mall.

00:51.176 --> 00:53.428
Now, if we can just keep it
moving east two more blocks,

00:53.511 --> 00:54.512
it's gonna be over in the Heights.

00:54.596 --> 00:56.264
(in gay-like tone)
That's just where it belongs!

00:56.347 --> 00:57.432
(crowd chattering)

00:57.515 --> 00:58.641
-LARUE: What?
-Um...

00:58.725 --> 01:03.188
Sergeant Bates, Officer Coffey,
Mayo, Garibaldi, Fisk,

01:03.271 --> 01:06.775
McDermott, LaRue, and Washington,
you're on it.

01:07.525 --> 01:08.777
Item eight, rides.

01:08.860 --> 01:12.030
Martin's with Cobb, Hill is with Rivera...

01:12.405 --> 01:14.365
um... Jamison's with Fraim.

01:14.449 --> 01:18.119
Item nine. Mick Belker continues
his drug undercover today,

01:18.203 --> 01:21.873
which the podium has not been
entrusted with the details.

01:21.956 --> 01:23.458
Uh, Renko is with him.

01:23.541 --> 01:28.671
Item 10. File your arrest reports today
with A.D.A. Michael Stockton.

01:28.755 --> 01:31.716
A.D.A Stockton also
will be taking any pleas.

01:31.800 --> 01:32.634
Davenport sick?

01:33.259 --> 01:36.805
That's still another subject
on which the podium lacks the poop.

01:36.888 --> 01:37.972
(chuckling)

01:38.056 --> 01:41.684
Item 11. Prematurely warm weather, folks.

01:41.768 --> 01:44.187
It's gonna be in the 80s out there today.

01:44.270 --> 01:46.981
Now, yeah, a word to the wise...

01:47.482 --> 01:49.359
Mornings before you go out

01:49.442 --> 01:53.238
is the time to check the coolant level
in your unit radiators.

01:53.321 --> 01:56.741
Now, you're full on coolant,
your engine's running smoothly,

01:57.117 --> 02:00.578
that's one more item less
for the worry list.

02:00.662 --> 02:02.872
Okay, that's it. Let's have a good shift.

02:03.498 --> 02:06.167
Let's do it to them
before they do it to us.

02:06.251 --> 02:08.920
Hooker undercovers,
that does not include you.

02:09.003 --> 02:11.464
(laughter)

02:15.510 --> 02:18.304
Hey! Cut it out, Luce.

02:18.388 --> 02:19.973
Now you know what women
have to go through.

02:20.056 --> 02:21.141
You don't have to go through that.

02:21.224 --> 02:22.809
Every day we live.

02:22.892 --> 02:24.227
(in gay-like tone) I could just kill him!

02:24.310 --> 02:26.187
On me, that mesh is a 4-count indictment.

02:26.271 --> 02:27.730
On him, simple elegance.

02:27.814 --> 02:29.315
Fall down and break a leg, LaRue.

02:30.066 --> 02:31.734
Plainclothes. Well, well, well.

02:31.818 --> 02:34.821
Seems like citizen Renko
is finally moving up in the world.

02:37.031 --> 02:40.326
You know, Robert, maybe I'm being foolish
to expect close friendship here,

02:40.410 --> 02:43.830
but I thought at least we could normalize
diplomatic relations.

02:43.913 --> 02:45.373
Then you thought wrong.

02:45.456 --> 02:48.501
So how about a little bit
of your basic civility, at least?

02:49.544 --> 02:51.921
When are you gonna let up on me
for what happened?

02:52.005 --> 02:53.548
I screwed up. I can admit that.

02:53.631 --> 02:55.133
But if you can't forgive me,

02:55.216 --> 02:57.468
then what's happened
between you and I is on you.

02:59.304 --> 03:00.430
Then it's on me.

03:03.558 --> 03:06.728
You're a complete bafflement to me.

03:13.568 --> 03:14.485
You ready, Bobby?

03:16.237 --> 03:17.071
Yeah.

03:19.991 --> 03:20.825
-Hi.
-Hi.

03:24.871 --> 03:25.830
You look hot today.

03:26.539 --> 03:27.373
Thank you.

03:28.166 --> 03:30.001
So, are we ever gonna
see each other again?

03:30.418 --> 03:31.294
Of course.

03:32.712 --> 03:34.339
Dinner? Tonight?

03:35.089 --> 03:37.842
Um... I'm gonna have
to let you know about that.

03:38.551 --> 03:39.385
Try.

03:39.677 --> 03:41.137
-HUNTER: Morning, Frank.
-Howard.

03:41.221 --> 03:43.139
-Now, don't get angry.
-No!

03:43.223 --> 03:45.391
I'm want to give you one last opportunity

03:45.475 --> 03:49.646
to get behind my funding request
for the SEVM prototype.

03:49.729 --> 03:52.815
Now, that's the Strategic Entry
Vehicle Modification.

03:52.899 --> 03:54.943
Yeah, I know about it,
and I don't want us behind it, Howard.

03:55.026 --> 03:57.737
I don't want us anywhere near it.
Thanks, Henry.

03:57.820 --> 03:59.656
Can't sell the battering ram, huh, Howard?

03:59.739 --> 04:02.617
The man will not stay current on hardware.

04:08.456 --> 04:09.290
Dennis.

04:14.921 --> 04:17.173
I don't know, Harry, I keep telling myself
I'm not gonna get sucked in

04:17.257 --> 04:18.466
to your adolescent crap...

04:19.550 --> 04:22.178
And then you pull stuff like you
just pulled outside, and I don't know.

04:22.262 --> 04:24.097
-Well, what stuff are we referencing--
-Stuff!

04:24.180 --> 04:25.181
Coming up behind the woman,

04:25.265 --> 04:27.809
putting your hands all over her,
nuzzling her hair.

04:27.892 --> 04:28.726
Jealous?

04:29.435 --> 04:31.521
What you do on your own time
and who you do that with

04:31.604 --> 04:32.897
-is none of my business.
-Got that right.

04:32.981 --> 04:35.566
Until you wave it under my nose
and wink at me.

04:35.650 --> 04:37.235
That's a squad room out there,
not a motel room!

04:37.318 --> 04:40.113
Well, maybe you ought to keep that in mind
the next time Gina comes up.

04:40.780 --> 04:42.156
Is that the real agenda, Harry?

04:42.824 --> 04:44.284
You need to show me up that bad?

04:44.367 --> 04:46.786
Well, according to Fay,
that ship's already sailed.

04:47.161 --> 04:49.789
You see, according to Fay,
in your crucial events,

04:49.872 --> 04:52.667
technique and elapsed time,
it's no contest.

04:52.750 --> 04:55.253
And in your return to starting position,
you're not even--

04:55.920 --> 04:57.714
-(Harry groans)
-Now you listen to me, punk!

04:57.797 --> 05:00.008
Fay never said anything to you about me!

05:00.091 --> 05:02.593
She's got too much class for that,
and she's got too much class for you.

05:02.677 --> 05:03.803
That is your poison.

05:04.512 --> 05:07.098
And if you're using her to get at me,
if you do anything to hurt her,

05:07.181 --> 05:08.016
I will kill you.

05:09.517 --> 05:10.643
Do you understand me?

05:16.941 --> 05:19.777
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch. We have a 9-11.</i>

05:19.861 --> 05:21.612
<i>Armed robbery in progress.</i>

05:21.696 --> 05:25.491
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

05:25.575 --> 05:27.118
(sirens wailing)

05:32.623 --> 05:35.209
(theme music playing)

06:41.609 --> 06:45.738
Well, son, Andrew J. Renko has abluded
and is ready to start the day.

06:45.822 --> 06:47.824
-Our contacts--
-You know, it's a funny thing, Detective.

06:47.907 --> 06:49.909
I tried to get out of uniform for so long,

06:49.992 --> 06:52.078
and all I had to do
was break up with Bobby Hill.

06:52.161 --> 06:54.956
Ain't that funny?
All I had to do was break up with--

06:55.039 --> 06:56.457
Understand something, Renko.

06:57.083 --> 06:59.460
A, this is not a promotion for you.

06:59.544 --> 07:02.296
B, the fact is,
I opposed you working with me.

07:02.380 --> 07:05.883
And C, if you're looking at this
as a way to shine up your badge,

07:05.967 --> 07:07.301
I like it even less.

07:07.969 --> 07:08.803
Now...

07:09.470 --> 07:12.682
As long as you are with me,
we're gonna have some ground rules.

07:12.765 --> 07:13.891
Such as?

07:13.975 --> 07:17.812
Such as shut up and do what I tell you.
Do we understand each other?

07:17.895 --> 07:19.230
-Yeah.
-Good.

07:24.569 --> 07:26.696
-Whatcha got, Detective?
-How are you, Teddy?

07:27.321 --> 07:30.116
This is Officer Renko.
He's gonna be working with us.

07:30.199 --> 07:31.492
Beautiful, uh...

07:31.576 --> 07:34.203
So, what should I call you? Officer?

07:34.287 --> 07:35.246
Andy.

07:35.329 --> 07:37.081
Andy... solid.

07:38.624 --> 07:39.750
You want to run it for me?

07:39.834 --> 07:42.044
We are in the soda shop business.

07:42.128 --> 07:44.297
Alonzo gave me a couple things
that checked out

07:44.380 --> 07:46.757
and told me to fix up some things,
already got them done.

07:46.841 --> 07:48.050
Man, I've been up all night.

07:48.134 --> 07:49.260
-Man, I haven't seen my woman--
-That's great.

07:49.343 --> 07:51.262
When do we take first delivery?

07:51.637 --> 07:52.472
Noon.

07:52.763 --> 07:57.018
Now, you got to be holding
$8,500 cash money.

07:57.101 --> 07:59.645
-No ifs and buts--
-That's all taken care of.

08:00.271 --> 08:01.272
Right.

08:01.355 --> 08:03.441
Now, Alonzo's gonna want to rap
to you a little bit.

08:03.524 --> 08:06.027
Now, as long as you don't get
in his face too bad,

08:06.110 --> 08:08.029
they're gonna be selling us some soda.
(chuckling)

08:08.112 --> 08:09.113
All right, Teddy.

08:09.864 --> 08:13.534
Officer Renko is gonna be
working in the shop with us.

08:14.660 --> 08:17.288
Why you hitting me to this, man?
I told Alonzo it would just be you and me.

08:17.371 --> 08:19.707
Ah, it'll be all right.
I'll explain it to him.

08:21.751 --> 08:22.835
(laughs)

08:22.919 --> 08:24.879
Uh, nothing personal, Andy,

08:24.962 --> 08:26.589
it's just that Alonzo
don't like surprises.

08:26.672 --> 08:28.633
But T's the same with everybody.
I'm the same with y'all--

08:28.716 --> 08:30.468
Teddy? Teddy!

08:30.551 --> 08:34.555
You and me ain't gonna be pals,
so stop running me through the grease.

08:36.390 --> 08:37.892
Just being polite.

08:37.975 --> 08:40.895
Stay polite. Spare me your crap.

08:44.857 --> 08:46.025
Hold the crap...

08:47.443 --> 08:48.277
you got it.

08:50.279 --> 08:51.197
Yup.

08:54.075 --> 08:55.826
Your boy got something to prove or what?

08:55.910 --> 08:57.078
-Shut up, Teddy.
-Yeah.

08:58.162 --> 08:59.622
-Hi!
-Hi!

08:59.705 --> 09:01.832
Interesting breakfast with Tony Stoller.

09:02.667 --> 09:05.127
P.D.'s office wants you back,
and they'll pay big bucks to get you.

09:05.211 --> 09:06.921
Right, as far as that goes.
You got a minute?

09:07.004 --> 09:07.838
Sure.

09:08.548 --> 09:10.591
He made me an offer. My old job.

09:10.675 --> 09:13.094
Plus some supervising
in the Heights and Midtown.

09:13.177 --> 09:14.971
That's very impressive. Congratulations.

09:15.054 --> 09:16.222
Yes, it is.

09:16.305 --> 09:18.766
I guess my absence
made their heart grow fonder.

09:19.141 --> 09:21.435
-And yours?
-Still remembering the burnout.

09:22.436 --> 09:25.022
Still ambivalent as hell, but interested.

09:25.106 --> 09:26.190
Chapman would be under you.

09:27.316 --> 09:30.027
That's the other news.
They're going to fire her.

09:31.195 --> 09:32.154
To make room for you.

09:32.238 --> 09:33.447
It's got nothing to do with me.

09:33.531 --> 09:38.286
It's what you thought all along, drugs.
Cocaine. Apparently, it's no secret.

09:39.912 --> 09:43.874
On a cheerier note, happy anniversary.

09:43.958 --> 09:45.126
(chuckles)

09:45.209 --> 09:47.086
It's beautiful. Happy anniversary.

09:48.087 --> 09:48.963
You forgot.

09:50.214 --> 09:51.299
Forgot? Are you kidding?

09:51.382 --> 09:53.301
-You haven't been in your office?
-Not yet.

09:53.676 --> 09:57.054
I sent roses to your office.
And I made reservations at the Warrick.

09:57.138 --> 10:00.391
I could be seduced. (sighs) See you later.

10:00.975 --> 10:04.103
-Where you headed?
-More breakfast with Irwin Bernstein.

10:05.271 --> 10:07.231
This has to be my last
career move, Furillo.

10:07.315 --> 10:08.858
The extra meals are killing me.

10:15.573 --> 10:16.407
Henry.

10:16.991 --> 10:19.577
What's the name of that florist
downtown next to the court building?

10:19.660 --> 10:20.995
-Johansson's?
-Johansson's. Right.

10:21.078 --> 10:22.997
-What did you forget?
-Our anniversary.

10:23.080 --> 10:25.416
I have to get roses
on Joyce's desk in half an hour.

10:25.499 --> 10:27.376
Rumor has it she doesn't have a desk.

10:27.460 --> 10:29.920
All the more reason.
She has to feel remembered.

10:30.004 --> 10:33.174
Lead with the roses,
follow with a pair of diamond earrings.

10:33.257 --> 10:35.968
I'll send you to Shear and Loeb.
All memory lapses are forgiven.

10:36.052 --> 10:37.094
Diamond earrings?

10:37.178 --> 10:39.930
You know, or just the roses are great.
Just the roses will get it.

10:40.014 --> 10:42.433
Diamond earrings
aren't on every cop's budget, Henry.

10:43.017 --> 10:45.102
It hasn't taken me long to go jerk, right?

10:45.478 --> 10:48.898
Oh, you're okay.
In fact, I've never seen you happier.

10:48.981 --> 10:50.066
I love her, Frank.

10:50.149 --> 10:51.859
It's the damnedest thing.
I never thought--

10:52.610 --> 10:54.111
I just never knew you could be this happy.

10:55.363 --> 10:57.239
-Johansson's?
-They deliver.

10:57.323 --> 10:58.366
And the name of the jewelry store?

10:58.449 --> 10:59.909
Shear and Loeb.

10:59.992 --> 11:02.328
If you're really serious,
I'll call Sid Loeb for you.

11:03.329 --> 11:04.705
I have an account there.

11:08.209 --> 11:10.419
(siren wails)

11:10.503 --> 11:14.965
So to move to you, 65 a gram,
you sell it for 125.

11:15.049 --> 11:16.425
Sticks is the dime.

11:16.509 --> 11:19.762
We sell them for 25,
and that's your profit item.

11:19.845 --> 11:22.640
Now, you never want to ask me
for up-front.

11:23.557 --> 11:27.812
You never want your stock
to fall below 50 sticks and 100 grams.

11:28.729 --> 11:33.067
You got to move 50 grams a day
just to keep the franchise.

11:33.150 --> 11:34.777
Well, that's no problem.

11:34.860 --> 11:36.070
You hear me, Teddy?

11:36.153 --> 11:38.906
I heard you, man. I got it.
You know, it's solid, it's set right here.

11:38.989 --> 11:41.951
Opening taste
for the franchise is two grand.

11:42.034 --> 11:43.202
Yeah, two G's, babe.

11:43.285 --> 11:45.413
-That's what we agreed on, man.
-Plus, I need $6,500--

11:45.496 --> 11:47.373
Eighty-five hundred dollars.

11:48.708 --> 11:50.000
What a surprise, Teddy.

11:51.252 --> 11:52.545
What's the matter, Alonzo?

11:52.628 --> 11:54.547
You know, if I'm paying somebody
8,500 bucks,

11:54.630 --> 11:57.341
I usually like them to admit that I exist.

11:57.425 --> 11:58.968
I see you here.

11:59.802 --> 12:03.806
I just want Teddy's understanding,
him and me got a relationship.

12:03.889 --> 12:07.852
(chuckling) Yeah, I understand that, man.
Yeah, I understand that.

12:07.935 --> 12:11.355
That way, I don't have to worry
when I meet two people,

12:11.439 --> 12:13.357
and I'm only supposed to be meeting one.

12:13.441 --> 12:15.443
You see, I knew you was upset
about that, man.

12:15.526 --> 12:16.360
You know--

12:16.444 --> 12:19.280
'Cause me and you
got the relationship, Teddy.

12:19.363 --> 12:20.698
Any screw-ups, and it's you--

12:20.781 --> 12:22.992
-Okay, okay.
-Now, now, now, now!

12:23.075 --> 12:25.077
Teddy didn't know
that I hired another man.

12:25.161 --> 12:27.329
Hey, Carl, you got a problem
is I'm hearing, huh?

12:27.413 --> 12:28.456
-RENKO: We got problems here?
-I don't like--

12:28.539 --> 12:30.040
-We've got no problems.
-Let me help you with your problem.

12:30.124 --> 12:30.958
(shouting)

12:31.041 --> 12:33.627
-Let him go!
-Shut up! Shut up!

12:33.711 --> 12:34.628
Let him go, now!

12:34.712 --> 12:37.381
All right, listen, I'm just trying
to protect my friend here's interest.

12:37.465 --> 12:39.467
You understand that?
You got a problem with that?

12:39.550 --> 12:41.218
No, I ain't got no problem.
I ain't got no problem.

12:42.303 --> 12:44.180
That's nice.
Now nobody ain't got a problem.

12:53.647 --> 12:56.650
I apologize. He's all muscle.

12:56.734 --> 12:59.153
This man is a muscle head,
and he doesn't know how to act,

12:59.236 --> 13:00.279
and I'm sorry.

13:06.076 --> 13:08.412
It's all right. It's all right.

13:09.413 --> 13:10.498
Don't go to pieces.

13:13.459 --> 13:14.752
Do you want this from Teddy?

13:15.544 --> 13:16.837
You can give it to me.

13:22.343 --> 13:23.511
You're in business.

13:28.265 --> 13:29.391
Sorry, sorry.

13:30.810 --> 13:33.813
Anyway, uh... (chuckles)

13:33.896 --> 13:35.856
admitting error
isn't the most natural thing

13:35.940 --> 13:39.777
Mrs. Bernstein taught her son,
but I am sorry we had that fight,

13:39.860 --> 13:42.112
and I'm sorry I went behind your back
on the Wares case.

13:42.780 --> 13:45.032
-Apologies accepted.
-Hell of a thing.

13:45.115 --> 13:47.201
You're on the other side
of the aisle five years,

13:47.284 --> 13:51.121
haggling, dealing, outmaneuvering,
become good friends.

13:51.497 --> 13:54.208
A couple of months on the same team,
we're at each other's throats.

13:54.959 --> 13:56.961
Maybe that's one reason
why it's right I leave.

13:57.044 --> 13:57.878
Really?

13:58.337 --> 14:00.130
Our friendship means that much to you?

14:00.506 --> 14:01.632
Yes, it does.

14:03.843 --> 14:04.802
I'm flattered. I...

14:06.512 --> 14:09.640
Which doesn't prevent me from saying
the D.A. badly wants you back.

14:10.057 --> 14:12.518
He considers you the best
new assistant we've got.

14:12.977 --> 14:15.062
Uh, a credit to your gender. Just kidding.

14:15.145 --> 14:17.773
And we'll match any offer
the P.D. throws up there.

14:18.482 --> 14:21.277
I've had five months to look at it
from the D.A.'s side, Irwin.

14:21.360 --> 14:23.737
I still think the system's
unfair to the poor.

14:23.821 --> 14:24.655
How so?

14:25.239 --> 14:29.159
Really, the way I see it,
the poor get caught the most,

14:29.243 --> 14:31.161
but they're also
the main victims of crime.

14:31.996 --> 14:33.914
But if you're rich and a little greedy,
you get away with things

14:33.998 --> 14:36.000
that if you're poor and a little greedy,
you can't.

14:36.375 --> 14:38.294
That's what a public defender
addresses every day,

14:38.377 --> 14:40.296
and no one else in our society does.

14:41.422 --> 14:43.924
Just a few months ago, you were fed up.
Hmm?

14:44.008 --> 14:46.218
Your left was tired.
You wanted to try your right.

14:47.261 --> 14:48.762
Guess I'm a born southpaw.

14:48.846 --> 14:52.057
Mm, you're going back
to the P.D.'s office, aren't you?

14:52.391 --> 14:53.934
Stoller's already made you an offer.

14:54.518 --> 14:55.352
A good one.

14:56.145 --> 14:58.022
Our matching it won't keep you?

14:58.856 --> 14:59.690
No.

15:00.482 --> 15:01.942
Ah... (taps table)

15:02.610 --> 15:03.444
Well...

15:05.029 --> 15:06.488
See you across the aisle, lefty.

15:19.752 --> 15:20.586
(honks horn)

15:23.005 --> 15:23.964
BATES: Nice wheels.

15:24.548 --> 15:25.382
Should I get in?

15:25.466 --> 15:28.385
No offense, but the man
in the back says... her.

15:28.469 --> 15:31.096
No offense... creep.

15:32.222 --> 15:33.140
You've got a fan.

15:35.351 --> 15:36.685
Somebody want to talk to me?

15:37.227 --> 15:38.062
You got it.

15:42.232 --> 15:45.819
Little on-site spot check
to evaluate field performance, Detective.

15:46.403 --> 15:47.237
MAYO (on radio):<i> Chief?</i>

15:47.321 --> 15:48.656
DANIELS (on radio):
<i>Attractive appearance...</i>

15:49.073 --> 15:51.951
Neutral initiating inquiry,
no question of entrapment.

15:52.576 --> 15:53.661
High marks all around.

15:54.453 --> 15:55.329
Thank you, Chief.

15:55.829 --> 15:59.833
If I were on the prowl, Patsy,
I'd be inclined to go deep into my pocket.

15:59.917 --> 16:00.751
(chuckling)

16:01.377 --> 16:02.753
I guess that's a compliment?

16:03.379 --> 16:05.756
It certainly is. Carry on.

16:08.509 --> 16:09.885
(engine turns over)

16:13.222 --> 16:16.225
One hundred percent, grade-A slime ball.

16:17.393 --> 16:18.227
(horn honks)

16:19.269 --> 16:22.314
(car radio plays)

16:22.398 --> 16:24.817
-Hi, honey.
-Thought that guy was gonna pitch a tent.

16:25.359 --> 16:27.277
Yeah, he was all talk. A real chump.

16:27.861 --> 16:29.613
Well, I'm all action. Get in.

16:29.697 --> 16:31.115
Let's talk about what you want.

16:33.075 --> 16:36.537
I want to hear you speak a little French.

16:37.121 --> 16:40.749
Aw, he wants her to talk French.
He's gonna wish he went to Berlitz.

16:41.458 --> 16:44.211
BATES (on radio):
<i>French is gonna be about 25 bucks.</i>

16:44.294 --> 16:45.963
Thirty. If you're good.

16:46.255 --> 16:47.715
(chuckling)

16:47.798 --> 16:49.299
BATES (on radio):
<i>Well, I never had any complaints.</i>

16:49.383 --> 16:51.468
Unit, we got a pickup.

16:51.552 --> 16:53.762
Well, then hop in.
Get off the street, will ya?

16:53.846 --> 16:56.348
Uh, we're talking 30 American bucks,
aren't we?

16:56.432 --> 16:58.434
-(grunting)
-Police. You're under arrest.

16:58.517 --> 17:00.811
-What did I do?
-Solicitation.

17:02.438 --> 17:05.524
-Come on, turn around.
-Oh, we didn't do anything.

17:05.607 --> 17:06.734
Give me a break.

17:06.817 --> 17:08.068
Oh, this isn't necessary.

17:08.152 --> 17:10.279
<i>Parlez-vous Français, </i>cheapskate?

17:10.362 --> 17:11.488
You have the right to remain silent.

17:11.572 --> 17:13.323
If you give up the right
to remain silent...

17:13.407 --> 17:15.492
(siren wails)

17:24.418 --> 17:25.669
Hey, Number 37.

17:26.712 --> 17:29.173
Joey "Jack Rabbit" Joe Coffey!

17:29.798 --> 17:32.051
-(laughing)
-Coach Beasley.

17:32.134 --> 17:33.052
Oh, wow.

17:33.135 --> 17:35.512
This is what an old coach loves.
Bricks in the belly.

17:35.596 --> 17:36.430
BEASLEY:<i> You're still in perfect shape.</i>

17:36.513 --> 17:38.515
<i>-What is it, 15 years?</i>
<i>-</i>JOE:<i> Yeah.</i>

17:38.599 --> 17:41.268
So, uh, where you off to?
Look, don't let me keep you.

17:41.351 --> 17:42.644
Hey, I got time.

17:43.479 --> 17:45.773
Fact is, uh, you know, I'm kind of busy.

17:45.856 --> 17:47.816
Hey, Joe, remember the South Side game?

17:47.900 --> 17:50.903
You came out with that pinkie dislocated,
sticking out all sideways?

17:50.986 --> 17:54.239
I yank it back straight,
you go back in and win the scoring title.

17:54.323 --> 17:56.533
-Remember that?
-Yeah, it was a long time ago.

17:56.617 --> 17:58.619
So what's the matter, Joe?
You look all jumpy.

17:58.702 --> 17:59.787
Uh, no, nothing.

17:59.870 --> 18:02.081
Just that, you know,
I got a lot of things to do.

18:02.164 --> 18:03.290
I think maybe you should leave.

18:03.373 --> 18:04.750
Will you look at me, Joey?

18:06.543 --> 18:08.629
I got a suspicion.
I know what you're doing here.

18:08.712 --> 18:11.048
<i>You think, "Coach thinks</i>
<i>I'm a sissy," right?</i>

18:11.131 --> 18:14.051
Wrong, that's the last
thing on my mind, Joe.

18:16.637 --> 18:18.806
Coach, I really don't think you
want to be here, all right?

18:18.889 --> 18:21.391
Yeah, but I do, Joey.
That's what I'm trying to tell you.

18:22.810 --> 18:24.394
No, why don't you just shove off,
all right?

18:24.478 --> 18:27.147
Hey, Joe, come on. Let me relax you, kid.

18:27.231 --> 18:29.149
JOE:<i> Hey, what, what, what?</i>

18:29.608 --> 18:31.360
Joey, I want to send in a play.

18:32.319 --> 18:33.153
-Come here.
-What?

18:33.237 --> 18:34.363
Come here, come here.

18:35.322 --> 18:38.158
(whispers)

18:42.204 --> 18:44.623
Are you sure about that?
I mean, are you sure you want to do that?

18:45.833 --> 18:48.001
I'd give you a damn kiss
right now if you let me.

18:51.130 --> 18:53.507
All right, why don't you
wait for me back there?

18:53.590 --> 18:56.426
Uh, I got a car, green car.
Yeah, I'll be right back there.

18:59.388 --> 19:00.639
Oh, coach.

19:01.765 --> 19:03.433
[man] Awesome, isn't it, Lieutenant?

19:04.935 --> 19:06.645
Devastating... big.

19:08.480 --> 19:09.481
You like her, Pauli?

19:10.482 --> 19:15.362
You know, Lieutenant, just looking at her,
I realize I was born too late.

19:16.071 --> 19:18.615
WWII. That was my time.

19:19.700 --> 19:22.077
But these babies,
they couldn't cut it at Quesan.

19:22.161 --> 19:26.248
Well, that's altogether
different terrain requirements.

19:26.331 --> 19:27.374
Guerrilla warfare.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.877
Man, that wasn't happening for me.

19:30.294 --> 19:33.839
You know, after I bought her,
I'd sit inside.

19:34.464 --> 19:37.968
I'd wheel that turret around, and bam!

19:38.051 --> 19:38.886
North Africa.

19:39.803 --> 19:42.055
Boom! The Ardennes.

19:42.139 --> 19:45.225
Audie Murphy. That was my kind of soldier.

19:45.309 --> 19:48.270
Get those heinies in your crosshairs.

19:49.146 --> 19:52.399
Put her into jungle,
and she's like a dog with no feet.

19:52.774 --> 19:53.609
(clears throat)

19:53.817 --> 19:56.987
Well, here's hoping that, uh,
her new career on the Hill

19:57.070 --> 19:59.156
will recapture some of that past glory.

19:59.907 --> 20:02.367
I wouldn't have sold her
to anybody but you, Lieutenant.

20:03.160 --> 20:06.788
I wouldn't have sold her at all
if they hadn't had cut off my disability.

20:08.081 --> 20:09.666
Unless I miss my guess, Pauli,

20:10.417 --> 20:15.672
I'd say before too long that this vehicle
will be the quintessential<i> sine qua non</i>

20:15.756 --> 20:17.674
of urban peace enforcement.

20:18.175 --> 20:19.092
(horn honks)

20:20.552 --> 20:21.386
Right on time.

20:34.650 --> 20:36.193
-Chief.
-Howard.

20:37.986 --> 20:39.196
Will you look at that?

20:39.947 --> 20:42.407
-HUNTER: As advertised.
-DANIELS: I'm impressed.

20:42.950 --> 20:44.117
She's completely street-ready?

20:44.201 --> 20:46.495
Oh, yes, all the modifications
are completed.

20:47.120 --> 20:49.623
Vulcanized the track there,
won't chew up the pavement.

20:49.706 --> 20:51.792
And this ram that they've
installed, Chief,

20:51.875 --> 20:54.378
it'll go through six inches of steel
like so much meringue.

20:54.461 --> 20:55.712
Excellent, excellent.

20:56.296 --> 20:59.258
This prototype's gonna convince
those council namby-pambies

20:59.341 --> 21:00.801
on the whole concept, Howard.

21:01.009 --> 21:02.552
Well, you know that I wouldn't
have come to you directly

21:02.636 --> 21:04.846
unless I thought you shared my enthusiasm.

21:04.930 --> 21:06.139
And I'm delighted.

21:06.223 --> 21:10.060
Now, how much are you
personally out of pocket?

21:10.143 --> 21:11.687
Well, it's several thousand.

21:11.770 --> 21:12.688
That's fine.

21:13.230 --> 21:15.899
We bag a few lowlifes
with this prototype, Howard,

21:16.525 --> 21:19.069
you'll get first money
from the general appropriation

21:19.152 --> 21:21.071
I expect we'll quickly receive.

21:21.405 --> 21:23.782
Howard, you've done a tremendous job.

21:23.865 --> 21:25.617
Thank you, Chief. A moment, a moment.

21:30.080 --> 21:33.959
This is retired Corporal Schelkopf.

21:34.835 --> 21:36.670
I think he deserves
a lot of credit, Chief.

21:37.004 --> 21:38.255
Many thanks, Corporal.

21:39.131 --> 21:40.841
Happy to be of service, sir!

21:42.926 --> 21:45.137
-Carry on.
-Isn't she beautiful, sir?

21:45.971 --> 21:49.016
It's like watching
baby birds leave the nest.

21:57.316 --> 22:01.278
Arnold Solomon,
public defender requested on solicitation.

22:01.361 --> 22:02.571
Do we have to take out an ad?

22:02.654 --> 22:04.031
Upstairs interrogation.

22:05.407 --> 22:08.285
Guys, uh, we've got things to talk about.

22:08.368 --> 22:10.037
Uh, we've got things to deal.

22:10.120 --> 22:11.079
Okay, Mr. Solomon.

22:11.163 --> 22:13.915
Yeah, now, I should have her discuss it
with you, right?

22:14.124 --> 22:15.334
We'll be all ears.

22:15.625 --> 22:18.253
Mr. Solomon was
Amelia Earhart's navigator.

22:18.337 --> 22:20.130
He knows where the plane went down.

22:20.505 --> 22:22.007
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

22:22.382 --> 22:26.303
Solomon Real Estate?
Is that your home address?

22:27.346 --> 22:30.098
It's a legal residence.
I got an apartment back of my office.

22:30.182 --> 22:32.059
This is ludicrous. You're not indigent.

22:32.934 --> 22:36.188
Now why don't you just get it up
to hire your family lawyer?

22:36.271 --> 22:38.899
Because he happens to be
my wife's brother.

22:39.733 --> 22:41.777
Well, then get a lawyer
from the yellow pages.

22:42.361 --> 22:44.404
Look, this will take two minutes.

22:44.488 --> 22:47.908
I-I'll tell you my information,
you take it to the cops, and believe me--

22:47.991 --> 22:50.369
And believe<i> me,</i>
I have got better things to do

22:50.452 --> 22:52.704
than run interference
for your Jewish guilt!

22:52.788 --> 22:55.332
You are not indigent! Hire a lawyer.

22:55.999 --> 22:57.125
WOMAN: Phone call, Miss Chapman.

22:58.543 --> 23:01.338
-Hey, Joey...
-Coach, I got to book you. I'm sorry.

23:01.421 --> 23:02.756
Will you give me a break here?

23:02.839 --> 23:05.092
I knew you from when you were 15.
Can't you just talk to me?

23:05.175 --> 23:07.302
Wh-- Do you think I like doing this?

23:07.386 --> 23:08.762
Do you think I like busting you like this?

23:08.845 --> 23:09.763
I know you don't.

23:09.846 --> 23:11.932
That's why we got to get this
straightened out.

23:13.642 --> 23:14.810
All right, come over here.

23:15.352 --> 23:17.312
I don't like being put on hold, you know?

23:17.646 --> 23:20.107
And I don't have a lot of time to chat.
What's up?

23:20.649 --> 23:22.734
Yes, but yeah, I can hear you, go ahead.

23:23.443 --> 23:25.320
You know, I really used to look up to you.

23:25.612 --> 23:27.406
I remember all those times
you used to talk to us

23:27.489 --> 23:30.534
about being stand-up, about being a man.

23:30.617 --> 23:32.994
Well, you can just forget
that inference, Joey.

23:33.995 --> 23:35.831
In 32 years,
I never laid a glove on a kid.

23:35.914 --> 23:37.666
I tapped a fanny, it meant "good going."

23:37.749 --> 23:39.501
No more than that. I love my kids.

23:39.584 --> 23:41.461
Look, I'm not saying
you weren't a good coach.

23:41.545 --> 23:43.213
If you were one of my guys, I'd back you.

23:43.296 --> 23:45.465
I don't care if you fumbled,
blew a tackle.

23:46.383 --> 23:47.467
I never held you up to ridicule.

23:47.551 --> 23:50.429
Now here I make one little mistake,
what are you gonna do, ruin my life?

23:51.054 --> 23:52.681
You gonna wreck my reputation, Joey?

23:54.266 --> 23:55.225
Think of Mrs. B.

24:00.230 --> 24:02.691
(sighs) All right, look, please,
don't waste my time.

24:03.233 --> 24:05.652
You're saying that when I get your sheet,
that it's gonna be clean.

24:05.735 --> 24:07.112
There's not gonna be anything on it.

24:07.195 --> 24:08.530
My hand to God.

24:10.782 --> 24:11.616
All right.

24:12.033 --> 24:14.411
If it checks out, then,
then we'll see what we can do.

24:15.162 --> 24:16.413
Thanks a lot, kid.

24:16.788 --> 24:17.747
For what reason?

24:20.500 --> 24:21.835
No, I'm not surprised at all.

24:23.670 --> 24:27.257
Stab me right in the back.
No, I'm not surprised.

24:30.093 --> 24:32.179
You know, none of it
made sense until the end.

24:32.762 --> 24:34.347
I couldn't understand what was going on

24:34.431 --> 24:36.850
until Tony Stoller told me
who they wanted for my job.

24:36.933 --> 24:37.767
Look, if you're talking about--

24:37.851 --> 24:39.102
You know what I'm talking about.

24:39.186 --> 24:40.395
I am canned!

24:40.479 --> 24:41.605
-I'm out on my butt!
-Connie!

24:41.688 --> 24:43.273
JOYCE: Look, Connie,
I am sorry about that.

24:43.356 --> 24:44.483
I hope things work out for you.

24:44.566 --> 24:46.359
Oh, yeah, it's so nice and neat,
right, Joyce?

24:46.443 --> 24:48.195
All tucked in, pinned up and put together?

24:48.278 --> 24:50.947
I bet you were
a piece of cake to toilet train.

24:51.531 --> 24:52.365
Excuse me.

24:52.449 --> 24:55.202
You are not gonna walk away from this.
It will not be so nice and neat.

24:55.285 --> 24:56.703
-You're not gonna use your connections...
-Let go of my arm!

24:56.786 --> 24:57.621
...to get me fired...

24:57.996 --> 25:00.290
and then walk away! You cost me my job!

25:00.373 --> 25:01.291
Wrong!

25:02.167 --> 25:04.002
You managed that all by yourself.

25:04.085 --> 25:05.795
Now, if you don't start facing
your problems,

25:05.879 --> 25:06.880
you could lose a lot more.

25:06.963 --> 25:09.216
You are a sterile, self-righteous prig.

25:09.299 --> 25:10.592
Let go of me.

25:10.675 --> 25:12.511
You've got your own private Gestapo,
right, Joyce?

25:12.594 --> 25:13.637
Just come with me, would you, please?

25:13.720 --> 25:15.180
Let go of my arm!

25:21.478 --> 25:22.562
What in the hell
do you think you're doing?

25:22.646 --> 25:23.563
Don't.

25:29.653 --> 25:32.030
Even a fascist like you knows
that's a queried search.

25:32.614 --> 25:34.908
We go to court,
it gets kicked in 30 seconds.

25:34.991 --> 25:36.076
Along with your career.

25:36.159 --> 25:38.203
If I wanted to bust, Miss Chapman,

25:38.495 --> 25:40.163
I'd have gone about it
a little differently.

25:41.248 --> 25:42.207
What do you want?

25:42.290 --> 25:43.542
It's your addiction, what do you want?

25:43.625 --> 25:44.918
I want to be left alone!

25:45.001 --> 25:47.170
Suit yourself,
but you have to know this is no secret.

25:47.254 --> 25:48.672
You lost your job over it.

25:49.965 --> 25:50.799
My job?

25:54.261 --> 25:55.679
What do you know about my job?

25:58.223 --> 26:00.475
Did it ever occur to you
that somebody in my job

26:00.559 --> 26:02.519
has to be high just to stay even?

26:04.604 --> 26:08.108
Do you know how many lies and broken lives
I have to look at every day?

26:08.733 --> 26:09.693
Of course I do.

26:11.778 --> 26:12.612
Oh, God.

26:16.199 --> 26:18.118
I-I guess I need help.

26:20.954 --> 26:22.122
I could see a shrink, maybe,

26:22.497 --> 26:24.291
as soon as I get a break in my schedule.

26:24.708 --> 26:26.167
I've done some research for you.

26:27.085 --> 26:29.212
Those are the numbers
of the three rehab programs

26:29.296 --> 26:31.798
in which the departments
had the highest rate of recovery.

26:33.800 --> 26:35.719
You think I don't know
that I have this problem

26:35.802 --> 26:38.305
and that maybe I'd been planning
to deal with it?

26:38.388 --> 26:40.348
I just don't think I can stop right now.

26:41.349 --> 26:45.520
And getting me fired and making me join
a program at gunpoint

26:45.604 --> 26:47.063
is not going to make it any easier.

26:47.147 --> 26:49.065
Make the call, Connie, now.

26:49.691 --> 26:51.276
Next time the bust will be for real.

26:59.451 --> 27:00.910
Captain, can you check this?

27:02.454 --> 27:05.040
(background conversations)

27:17.510 --> 27:22.849
(overlapping conversations)

27:29.981 --> 27:34.736
(background conversations continue)

27:45.330 --> 27:50.835
(background conversations continue)

28:09.646 --> 28:10.480
Yes, sir?

28:10.563 --> 28:13.400
Um... c-could I see those earrings?

28:14.067 --> 28:15.151
Exquisite, aren't they?

28:15.652 --> 28:18.446
Excellent clarity, no visible inclusions.

28:19.155 --> 28:20.031
How much?

28:20.115 --> 28:21.491
Seventeen-five.

28:24.786 --> 28:26.162
Seventeen thousand...

28:26.246 --> 28:27.997
Five hundred, yes.

28:28.248 --> 28:30.250
Perhaps if you'd tell me
what you'd be willing to spend?

28:31.042 --> 28:32.544
Oh, well, you know, um...

28:33.962 --> 28:36.506
Two, four hundred?

28:37.632 --> 28:40.343
Of course, that limits our selection.

28:43.054 --> 28:44.973
You know what?
My investment counselor tells me

28:45.056 --> 28:46.683
that the diamond market's glutted,

28:46.766 --> 28:48.351
and they're holding they're value.

28:48.601 --> 28:49.436
Uh-huh.

28:50.645 --> 28:52.313
The fact is, I wouldn't even
be thinking diamonds

28:52.397 --> 28:54.441
except it's my wife's birth stone.

28:54.524 --> 28:55.358
It's our anniversary.

28:55.442 --> 28:58.862
So it's a sentimental occasion.
How... nice.

28:58.945 --> 29:02.532
And how much would you be
willing to pay for sentimentality?

29:03.450 --> 29:05.118
Oh, you know... (clears throat)

29:06.161 --> 29:06.995
Six...

29:08.788 --> 29:09.622
Eight hundred?

29:11.374 --> 29:12.375
Maybe as high as nine.

29:13.418 --> 29:14.294
Let's see what we can do.

29:19.257 --> 29:20.425
So you broke up with your partner.

29:20.508 --> 29:22.135
It's too bad, it's not like somebody died.

29:22.218 --> 29:24.721
Hey, look, why don't you just mind
your own business on this, okay?

29:24.804 --> 29:26.389
You don't know a damned thing about it.

29:26.473 --> 29:28.391
All right, no offense.

29:29.517 --> 29:30.351
Sorry.

29:32.061 --> 29:35.899
Partner up with a guy five years,
you end up getting a lot to think about.

29:37.025 --> 29:37.859
I understand.

29:40.195 --> 29:42.405
Anyway, if it's a done thing,
for what it's worth,

29:42.489 --> 29:43.990
I'd sure like to be your partner.

29:45.658 --> 29:48.203
I'm not sure I want to partner up
just yet, but...

29:48.661 --> 29:49.704
I know, I know.

29:50.205 --> 29:51.831
No rush, I just thought I'd say it.

29:52.290 --> 29:53.416
I appreciate the thought.

29:53.500 --> 29:55.919
(man shouting in street)

29:56.002 --> 29:57.003
-Over there.
-Thief!

29:57.086 --> 29:58.505
-Thief, thief!
-(siren wailing)

29:58.588 --> 29:59.672
All right, pull over to the side.

30:01.090 --> 30:03.426
Take the corridor through the building.
I'll see you in the back alley.

30:03.510 --> 30:05.678
Stop that man! He's got a gun!

30:06.638 --> 30:07.514
(tires screeching)

30:07.597 --> 30:09.265
(siren wailing)

30:21.236 --> 30:22.070
RIVERA: Hey!

30:54.185 --> 30:55.687
(shouting)

31:07.657 --> 31:08.491
Rivera!

31:10.243 --> 31:11.077
You okay?

31:11.411 --> 31:12.996
-Where is he?
-I didn't see.

31:13.079 --> 31:13.955
Weren't you in the alley?

31:14.038 --> 31:15.456
I was just checking the doors.

31:21.170 --> 31:23.089
-Damn.
-Man, you sure you're okay?

31:23.381 --> 31:24.591
Yeah, I'm okay.

31:24.674 --> 31:25.925
I thought you were gonna be
in the damn alley.

31:26.009 --> 31:27.719
I was checking the doors, sorry.

31:28.344 --> 31:29.512
That's all right, that's all right.

31:29.596 --> 31:30.763
Let's get out of here, come on.

31:31.264 --> 31:33.725
Lieutenant, I want an agreement.

31:35.393 --> 31:38.104
If Mr. Solomon's information
is productive,

31:38.438 --> 31:39.981
there'll be no prosecution

31:40.231 --> 31:43.276
and no recorded arrest
on the soliciting charge.

31:43.359 --> 31:46.821
If the information pans out,
that's a reasonable expectation.

31:48.615 --> 31:49.616
(sighing deeply)

31:52.452 --> 31:55.330
I own several buildings up here.

31:56.623 --> 31:59.834
A few days ago,
I rented to a suspicious tenant.

31:59.918 --> 32:02.211
Oh, hey, that's good enough for me.
Let's kick him.

32:02.295 --> 32:03.546
Suspicious how, Mr. Solomon?

32:04.047 --> 32:07.300
Well, suspicious there was no
back and forth over the rental figure,

32:07.383 --> 32:10.011
which I might have quoted a little high.

32:11.220 --> 32:14.641
Plus, I drive by the building last night,

32:15.892 --> 32:20.063
it looks like he's put in steel bars
and a steel reinforced door,

32:20.146 --> 32:22.857
which the kid was...
Not that crime sensitive.

32:23.316 --> 32:24.400
Maybe a soda shop.

32:25.026 --> 32:27.570
I definitely think they could be
dealing drugs out of there.

32:27.654 --> 32:29.614
So you went back and you doubled the rent.

32:30.865 --> 32:31.908
Lieutenant.

32:33.451 --> 32:35.578
I can assure you that if we make arrests,

32:35.662 --> 32:38.247
your district attorney
will drop all charges.

32:38.331 --> 32:39.582
Can I have the address?

32:44.671 --> 32:46.881
Uh, let's get over there,
see if you can make a buy.

32:46.965 --> 32:48.049
What about a warrant?

32:48.132 --> 32:49.050
I'll have it for you.

32:49.133 --> 32:52.345
Howard, LaRue and Washington
need you to back-up. This address.

32:52.428 --> 32:54.305
It looks like it might be a soda shop,
Lieutenant.

32:54.389 --> 32:56.057
-Steel reinforced doors?
-That's correct.

32:56.140 --> 32:58.685
Say no more, my man. Say no more.

32:58.768 --> 33:01.062
Leo, what's going on?
It's been a half hour.

33:01.145 --> 33:02.939
Look, the whole system is down.

33:03.022 --> 33:05.900
You guys may have to wait 'til court
to get sheets on your perps.

33:06.359 --> 33:07.193
Great.

33:07.819 --> 33:08.736
Hey, Sarge.

33:10.863 --> 33:11.906
-Sarge.
-Hey, Joey?

33:12.407 --> 33:13.408
Okay if I call Mrs. B?

33:13.491 --> 33:15.618
She'll be worried, you know,
not hearing from me.

33:15.702 --> 33:17.537
Yeah, okay, use that phone, dial nine.

33:19.998 --> 33:22.291
-Sarge, uh... I got a situation.
-What?

33:23.334 --> 33:24.627
I got this guy on the sweep.

33:25.461 --> 33:27.130
There's no way I think he's a pervert.

33:27.213 --> 33:28.548
I think I might've screwed up.

33:29.048 --> 33:29.882
How so?

33:30.800 --> 33:32.051
I think I might've entrapped him.

33:32.135 --> 33:33.344
Entrapped him, how?

33:34.095 --> 33:35.471
Did he mention a sexual act?

33:36.305 --> 33:38.057
Now, what's a sexual act, for instance?

33:38.599 --> 33:39.642
I-I mean, legally?

33:40.309 --> 33:42.437
Well, did he offer money for sex or not?

33:45.231 --> 33:48.484
He offered to pay for my time to go
to a room and get to know him better,

33:48.943 --> 33:50.028
you know, like real men.

33:50.695 --> 33:52.655
But he never said what he meant, exactly.

33:54.407 --> 33:55.366
So what do you say?

34:00.872 --> 34:02.665
I'm just thinking
maybe we should kick him.

34:04.500 --> 34:06.753
The fact is, I think I can
vouch for the guy.

34:07.128 --> 34:08.588
He was my high school coach.

34:09.839 --> 34:11.966
Joe, we're back up.

34:12.216 --> 34:13.760
Here's your perp sheets.

34:16.012 --> 34:16.929
What's he got?

34:19.348 --> 34:20.349
Three disorderlies.

34:22.351 --> 34:23.186
For sex?

34:23.936 --> 34:24.771
It doesn't say.

34:25.271 --> 34:26.439
What would you guess?

34:31.027 --> 34:31.986
That's what you got to think of

34:32.070 --> 34:34.489
before you put that guy back
in a high school locker room.

34:35.031 --> 34:35.948
He's retired.

34:36.115 --> 34:37.408
That's not the point, anyway.

34:38.159 --> 34:40.286
The point is,
is there's a call for you to make.

34:43.206 --> 34:45.500
Sarge, you're saying you never
lost paperwork before?

34:45.583 --> 34:49.462
Yeah, four times in 27 years,
but only when there was no questions

34:49.545 --> 34:51.047
that I couldn't answer to myself.

34:52.340 --> 34:54.467
Can you answer all the questions
about this guy, Joe?

34:54.884 --> 34:56.928
Where he's gonna be tomorrow,
a year form now?

34:58.054 --> 34:59.222
That's how sure you gotta be,

34:59.305 --> 35:02.350
and then you gotta be willing
to pay the price if you get caught.

35:04.560 --> 35:05.478
He was a good man.

35:05.561 --> 35:06.729
-Mm.
-I liked him.

35:08.064 --> 35:09.816
You're not busting your memories, Joe.

35:14.487 --> 35:15.947
RAY: Frank, frank.

35:17.156 --> 35:19.450
While you were out,
we got a line on a soda shop.

35:19.534 --> 35:20.743
Somebody making a buy?

35:20.827 --> 35:22.703
LaRue and Washington are going for one.

35:23.246 --> 35:24.705
I got Howard backing them up.

35:25.331 --> 35:27.792
I authorized him to move on it,
if they make a buy.

35:28.835 --> 35:30.878
The place was heavily fortified, Frank.

35:31.129 --> 35:32.713
I thought the action was justified.

35:32.797 --> 35:33.631
We have a warrant?

35:34.298 --> 35:35.424
Judge just called it in.

35:36.092 --> 35:37.760
Van Buren near 116.

35:38.010 --> 35:39.971
Call it back, that's Belker's undercover.

35:40.680 --> 35:41.722
Why didn't you tell me?

35:42.056 --> 35:43.307
Paranoia out of Division.

35:43.391 --> 35:45.601
Last couple of weeks, they've been worried
about cops on the take.

35:46.310 --> 35:47.478
I hope it's not too late.

35:52.400 --> 35:54.527
(ignition starts, voices on police radio)

35:56.904 --> 36:01.367
(tank rumbling)

36:04.328 --> 36:05.538
-Hey, Teddy.
-TEDDY: Hey, Alonzo.

36:05.621 --> 36:07.415
-ALONZO: We have to talk.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah, hang on.

36:07.498 --> 36:08.624
Just a second.

36:09.458 --> 36:10.334
Hey, Mike!

36:10.418 --> 36:11.377
(knocking on door)

36:11.460 --> 36:13.880
-Probably, uh, sampling the product.
-ALONZO: Yeah.

36:14.630 --> 36:16.257
Hey, Mike, Mike,
somebody wants to talk to us.

36:16.340 --> 36:18.050
See, here he is, no problem.

36:18.134 --> 36:21.804
(rattling)

36:30.730 --> 36:33.649
(metal crashing)

36:33.733 --> 36:35.151
-Alonzo?
-What the hell is that?

36:35.234 --> 36:36.485
RENKO: Mick? Mick?

36:36.569 --> 36:38.237
(rumbling)

36:39.947 --> 36:42.825
(glass shattering)

36:43.367 --> 36:44.368
MAN: Hey!

36:45.411 --> 36:47.079
-Mick?
-MICK: Get out!

36:47.163 --> 36:48.664
Mick? Get out of here, Mick!

36:55.504 --> 36:56.756
(gunshots)

37:02.929 --> 37:04.013
HUNTER: (on speaker):<i> This is the police.</i>

37:04.096 --> 37:06.098
-Drop it!
-HUNTER:<i> You are completely surrounded.</i>

37:06.182 --> 37:09.852
-HUNTER:<i> Repeat, this is the police.</i>
-We're the police! We're the police!

37:09.936 --> 37:10.937
HUNTER:<i> Drop your weapons.</i>

37:12.772 --> 37:13.940
Put your hands up!

37:15.650 --> 37:17.443
MICK: Drop it, drop it.

37:17.818 --> 37:19.612
What you got to say now? I'm a cop.

37:19.695 --> 37:22.615
-Mick?
-Drop it, drop it, drop it!

37:23.616 --> 37:25.284
Judas, what in the world
are you doing here?

37:25.660 --> 37:27.203
(growling)

37:30.790 --> 37:33.292
-Hey, Howard--
-You gave me the assignment, Ray.

37:33.376 --> 37:36.254
I'm not a mind-reader
and neither do I have x-ray vision.

37:36.337 --> 37:39.382
I said to go as back-up.
I did not tell you to invade Germany.

37:39.465 --> 37:43.678
Maybe if your right hand knew what
your left hand was doing occasionally,

37:43.761 --> 37:44.887
we wouldn't have this problem, Ray.

37:44.971 --> 37:46.555
That was not my fault!

37:48.557 --> 37:50.768
-A tank?
-Heavily modified, Frank.

37:51.894 --> 37:52.728
A tank.

37:53.396 --> 37:55.439
-Let's take this in my office.
-Good bust, gents.

37:56.691 --> 37:58.109
Congratulations, Lieutenant.

37:59.026 --> 38:01.570
From what I hear,
she was absolutely sensational.

38:01.654 --> 38:02.822
HUNTER: All we could hope for, Chief.

38:03.698 --> 38:07.034
I understand we had a little confusion
about that undercover being in place.

38:07.118 --> 38:08.411
FRANK: We were under orders here, Chief.

38:08.494 --> 38:12.081
On all drug undercovers, only the captain
and the operative are to know.

38:12.164 --> 38:14.583
Well, no harm, no foul.

38:15.001 --> 38:15.960
From where I'm sitting,

38:16.043 --> 38:18.045
Howard's action looks like
a solid backing up

38:18.129 --> 38:21.674
of an undercover that's netted
us a chief narcotics player.

38:21.757 --> 38:22.925
That's one way to look at it.

38:23.551 --> 38:25.886
I wish I could've seen their faces
when you came through that wall.

38:25.970 --> 38:28.764
I'll bet those punks thought
it was the wrath of Jehovah!

38:28.848 --> 38:30.349
You knew about this?

38:30.433 --> 38:31.517
I fought for it.

38:32.268 --> 38:33.978
Lieutenant Hunter took the initiative,

38:34.603 --> 38:38.357
I secured an allocation to see to it
he's reimbursed for all expenses.

38:38.441 --> 38:41.193
As far as the cutting edge
is concerned, gentlemen,

38:41.652 --> 38:45.614
this city's finest takes a back seat
to no jurisdiction, anywhere.

38:46.365 --> 38:49.452
Frank, that applies to all the principals,
huh?

38:50.202 --> 38:51.954
I've got to make a press conference.

38:52.038 --> 38:55.333
Howard, you're going to have
to take me out for a little spin someday.

38:57.501 --> 38:58.919
If you'll excuse us, Ray.

38:59.253 --> 39:00.379
Howard, in my office.

39:13.434 --> 39:14.560
So it was an end-run.

39:19.648 --> 39:21.525
You were categorically opposed, Frank.

39:22.276 --> 39:25.404
And given the strength of my convictions,
I felt compelled to take the step.

39:25.488 --> 39:28.324
Regardless to the thing's
admitted effectiveness, Howard,

39:28.824 --> 39:32.328
the reason I oppose it is that it is
a public relations disaster.

39:32.411 --> 39:34.497
Well, perhaps if you'd taken
the time to elaborate.

39:34.580 --> 39:36.582
If I'd known you were
gonna go over my head, Howard,

39:36.665 --> 39:38.459
I'd have been more than happy
to quote chapter and verse.

39:38.542 --> 39:41.003
I plead extraordinary circumstances.

39:41.712 --> 39:45.925
Using a military weapon like that one
against a civilian population is overkill.

39:46.008 --> 39:47.676
It's just plain wrong.

39:50.721 --> 39:53.933
There is no question that
we disagree here, Frank.

39:54.975 --> 39:55.810
Anything else?

39:57.686 --> 39:58.521
No.

40:02.817 --> 40:04.026
Minding my own business,

40:04.110 --> 40:06.487
some smart aleck I wouldn't touch
with a pooper scooper

40:06.570 --> 40:08.406
comes onto me about Swedish massage.

40:08.489 --> 40:10.908
You know, one time I'd like to hear
one of these guys say, "I did it."

40:10.991 --> 40:12.076
I swear I'd let him go.

40:12.159 --> 40:13.661
-I did it.
-I lied.

40:13.744 --> 40:15.454
Natalie, soliciting to commit.

40:15.538 --> 40:16.455
I didn't do it.

40:16.914 --> 40:18.040
Harry, you got a minute?

40:18.541 --> 40:20.251
I ain't got a second for you, Goldblume.

40:20.334 --> 40:21.961
-That's real smart.
-Jam it.

40:23.671 --> 40:24.505
Look.

40:26.882 --> 40:27.716
Harry.

40:28.509 --> 40:29.802
What's going on here is N.G.

40:31.637 --> 40:34.557
Fay and I are friends.
You and I used to be friends.

40:34.640 --> 40:36.058
Gina and I are in love.

40:36.892 --> 40:42.398
So what I'd like to do is suggest
we all go out to dinner tonight.

40:43.232 --> 40:44.066
Are you nuts?

40:44.150 --> 40:44.984
Maybe.

40:45.901 --> 40:48.571
But what I'd like to think is that
if we all sit down like adults

40:48.654 --> 40:50.239
and share a meal, my treat,

40:50.990 --> 40:53.492
we can air out the hostility
and resume friendly relations.

40:53.576 --> 40:54.827
Does Fay know about this?

40:54.910 --> 40:56.662
She said she will if you will.

40:59.415 --> 41:01.125
Oh, dinner it is.

41:02.042 --> 41:03.043
Ninos, eight o'clock.

41:03.836 --> 41:06.505
All right, down the hall,
right through those doors,

41:06.589 --> 41:08.966
down the steps
and into the bus to court, people.

41:13.304 --> 41:14.930
Couldn't see your way clear, huh, Joey?

41:15.014 --> 41:16.891
-Sorry, coach.
-My fault, Joey.

41:17.183 --> 41:19.268
Just keep doing whatever you're doing,
kid, you're in great shape.

41:23.022 --> 41:24.690
Hey, Renko, you got a minute?

41:26.192 --> 41:27.026
Yeah.

41:42.750 --> 41:43.584
I, um...

41:44.126 --> 41:45.920
-I want to apologize.
-Just like that.

41:46.545 --> 41:47.379
Yeah.

41:47.796 --> 41:48.923
Why all of a sudden now?

41:51.091 --> 41:53.052
Out there with Rivera today,
I made a mistake.

41:53.135 --> 41:54.720
I didn't freeze, but...

41:55.763 --> 41:56.597
I was slow.

41:57.097 --> 41:58.015
And hung out.

41:58.098 --> 41:58.933
Yeah.

42:00.559 --> 42:03.395
Well, I can't ask him
to forgive me for my mistake

42:03.479 --> 42:05.689
if I don't forgive you for yours.

42:09.276 --> 42:10.319
Apology accepted.

42:11.862 --> 42:13.239
Renko, I thought maybe, uh...

42:14.031 --> 42:17.243
I don't know, maybe...
We could partner again.

42:21.288 --> 42:22.915
I don't know about that part, Bobby.

42:23.290 --> 42:25.918
I can't guarantee you what happened
the other night might not happen again.

42:26.377 --> 42:27.211
I know that.

42:27.836 --> 42:29.255
But I'm willing to take my chance.

42:30.756 --> 42:32.508
Come on, Renko, don't make me crawl.

42:32.591 --> 42:33.509
Why not?

42:33.717 --> 42:37.388
You made me crawl, and all of a sudden
you turn around 180 degrees.

42:37.471 --> 42:39.515
It may make sense to you,
but it ain't that simple to me.

42:39.598 --> 42:41.809
I don't want to be on trial
every time I'm out there.

42:41.892 --> 42:42.726
I know that.

42:47.648 --> 42:52.528
Remember all that talk about Daryl Ann
and the baby, and the house,

42:52.611 --> 42:54.280
and Ray Augustine being killed,

42:54.363 --> 42:55.739
and I called you a cracker.

42:55.823 --> 42:57.741
A redneck. (laughing)

42:57.825 --> 42:59.118
Okay, a redneck.

42:59.827 --> 43:01.203
Well, what made me so mad

43:01.287 --> 43:04.123
was this other stuff that you were afraid
of losing, I never had.

43:05.666 --> 43:06.709
You can have it.

43:06.792 --> 43:09.128
(sighs) Renko, I'm 36 years old.

43:09.211 --> 43:10.588
I-I live alone.

43:12.256 --> 43:14.758
I have a good woman who... who loves me,

43:14.842 --> 43:17.970
who probably would marry me today
if I asked, but I can't ask, man.

43:19.096 --> 43:21.181
I've been through it
a half a dozen times before,

43:21.265 --> 43:24.143
and the moment we get this close,
something happens.

43:24.226 --> 43:25.269
I get angry.

43:26.228 --> 43:27.563
I don't know, Renko, something...

43:28.981 --> 43:31.275
I-I don't know how to forgive people.

43:32.401 --> 43:33.444
I'm too hard on 'em.

43:38.574 --> 43:41.118
The deal is, you're too hard on you, pal.

43:43.954 --> 43:47.458
Then help me ease up on me, then.

43:48.709 --> 43:49.543
Partner with me.

43:50.210 --> 43:51.045
Okay.

43:51.920 --> 43:52.755
Okay.

44:07.936 --> 44:09.730
I was so sure you'd forgotten.

44:11.148 --> 44:12.983
You sure played it like you'd forgotten.

44:13.317 --> 44:14.401
My poker face.

44:16.236 --> 44:18.155
You scored a lot of points with me today.

44:18.405 --> 44:19.657
You really surprised me.

44:20.741 --> 44:23.118
The happiest day of my life
was the day I married you.

44:25.996 --> 44:26.830
Not just that.

44:27.956 --> 44:30.334
Your kindness, what you did
for Connie Chapman.

44:33.212 --> 44:34.880
You didn't have to go the extra yard.

44:34.963 --> 44:36.006
It's been done for me.

44:37.549 --> 44:39.385
Hmm, all I saw was red.

44:40.386 --> 44:42.471
One last surprise from a surprising guy.

44:43.138 --> 44:44.765
(laughing)

44:45.099 --> 44:45.933
What?

44:47.935 --> 44:49.019
My God.

44:49.269 --> 44:50.437
They're beautiful.

44:53.107 --> 44:53.941
Oh...

44:55.693 --> 44:56.985
How can we afford these?

44:57.069 --> 44:58.028
I got a deal.

44:58.112 --> 44:59.655
(laughing)

44:59.738 --> 45:01.573
Ah, I mean it.

45:03.075 --> 45:04.576
Well, I figure every time you quit,

45:04.660 --> 45:06.745
they hire you back again
on a higher salary.

45:07.705 --> 45:09.081
You think I'm failing upward?

45:10.040 --> 45:11.625
Yeah, keep it up
and we'll be millionaires.

45:11.709 --> 45:13.293
(laughing)

45:14.211 --> 45:15.045
I love you.

45:26.849 --> 45:28.600
You didn't like me
in the beginning, either.

45:28.684 --> 45:31.979
You know, I didn't think you
liked me either when I met you.

45:32.062 --> 45:33.856
What do you mean?
I liked you when I first--

45:33.939 --> 45:35.733
Well, I know why you didn't like me.

45:36.233 --> 45:38.777
Why, because you're young
and beautiful and rich?

45:38.861 --> 45:41.447
You know, any two would have been enough
to make me dislike you.

45:41.530 --> 45:42.865
With all three,
you're lucky I let you live.

45:42.948 --> 45:44.241
(laughing)

45:44.366 --> 45:49.830
No, no, it's because
I'm really not a very nice person.

45:50.622 --> 45:51.832
HENRY: Yes, you are, of course you are.

45:51.915 --> 45:53.250
No, no, no, no, I'm not.

45:53.333 --> 45:56.462
See, you're nice,
so you think everybody else is too.

45:56.545 --> 45:57.379
That's not true.

45:57.463 --> 45:59.381
No, you know what,
that is true about you, Henry.

45:59.465 --> 46:01.633
Wait, wait, wait, he doesn't
think I'm nice.

46:02.676 --> 46:04.720
There's nothing
a little seasoning won't cure.

46:05.304 --> 46:07.222
(women laughing)

46:07.848 --> 46:09.850
You know why Henry and I fell in love?

46:10.309 --> 46:15.606
Because he's a hostage negotiator
and I was a hostage,

46:16.315 --> 46:21.236
a hostage to loneliness,
and Henry negotiated my safe release.

46:22.029 --> 46:24.323
-You know what, I like the way you think.
-GINA: You do?

46:24.406 --> 46:25.240
I don't.

46:25.616 --> 46:27.326
-You don't?
-No, no, I don't.

46:27.409 --> 46:29.161
I think when you put yourself down,

46:29.787 --> 46:33.290
you are sending bad suggestions
to your subconscious mind.

46:33.373 --> 46:34.917
Say, "I'm a nice person."

46:35.000 --> 46:40.464
All right, I'm a very, very nice,
wonderful, terrific person.

46:40.964 --> 46:43.175
And I have to go
to the bathroom, excuse me.

46:43.592 --> 46:44.468
Oh, me too.

46:44.843 --> 46:46.261
Henry, let her up.

46:46.345 --> 46:47.429
Henry!

46:58.857 --> 47:00.234
Miracle of miracles.

47:02.694 --> 47:04.279
I mean, I think they like each other.

47:04.863 --> 47:05.697
Yeah.

47:07.950 --> 47:09.660
So, Harry, are we gonna be good?

47:11.203 --> 47:12.704
Yeah, sure, she's crazy about you.

47:13.205 --> 47:14.081
I mean you and me.

47:15.123 --> 47:16.291
After this morning and all?

47:17.793 --> 47:18.627
Sure, why not?

47:19.378 --> 47:21.880
Really good?
I mean, I got no hard feelings.

47:24.007 --> 47:24.842
No, me neither.

47:25.926 --> 47:27.052
I'm glad for you guys.

47:28.011 --> 47:30.347
We all got to do what makes us happy,
right?

47:31.932 --> 47:33.058
Cheers.

47:35.185 --> 47:37.688
Yeah, man, I don't want to sound
like Father Time or anything,

47:39.022 --> 47:40.816
but being happy's really all
that matters, right?

47:45.237 --> 47:47.573
Now, I got a lot of great recipes
you could borrow, if you want.

47:47.656 --> 47:51.577
Oh, that's really nice of you,
but I don't actually cook that often.

47:51.660 --> 47:54.121
-No?
-No, Henry and I like to eat out a lot.

47:54.454 --> 47:55.914
Well, that could be very expensive.

47:55.998 --> 47:58.542
Well, Henry says
he wants to learn how to cook.

47:58.834 --> 48:01.253
Well, I think you should get him
some cooking lessons, then.

48:01.712 --> 48:02.838
(clatter)

48:05.257 --> 48:06.425
-Hey!
-Whoa!

48:06.508 --> 48:07.759
-Hey!
-Watch it!

48:07.843 --> 48:10.679
-Come on.
-(gunshots)

48:10.762 --> 48:12.848
-(screaming)
-HARRY: Fay! Fay, move!

48:13.223 --> 48:14.182
Move, Fay!

48:15.183 --> 48:16.560
Move, police!

48:31.158 --> 48:34.161
(closing theme playing)
