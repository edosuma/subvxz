00:00.784 --> 00:02.771
Previously on "Manhattan"...

00:02.796 --> 00:07.499
Behold, gentlemen, 150 micrograms

00:07.524 --> 00:09.969
of plutonium-239.

00:10.003 --> 00:13.911
The sample is at Dr. Akley's disposal.

00:14.031 --> 00:16.171
I got keys to the lab. I can let you in.

00:16.327 --> 00:17.367
Really?

00:17.418 --> 00:19.786
What the hell is going on in here?

00:20.288 --> 00:23.623
You conned me into
giving you the plutonium.

00:23.625 --> 00:27.127
I got Frank Winter an outside line today.

00:27.178 --> 00:30.380
He said that you took
work from other scientists

00:30.431 --> 00:31.765
and published it as your own.

00:31.799 --> 00:33.434
That's bullshit, Abby.

00:33.466 --> 00:35.018
They're all whores?

00:35.808 --> 00:39.355
You whiz kids. Always in your heads.

00:39.390 --> 00:41.441
You deserve some fun every once in a while.

00:41.475 --> 00:43.393
As long as you're paid up...

00:49.100 --> 00:52.220
This chrysanthemum, it's
supposed to be white.

00:53.537 --> 00:56.156
My honey bees, they're dead.

00:56.158 --> 00:57.457
All of them.

Guten Morgen, Dr. Heisenberg.

Manhattan 1x06
Acceptable Limits

03:13.871 --> 03:18.184
Sync and corrections by Albanda
www.Addic7ed.com

03:21.018 --> 03:22.802
She's very well-read.
You should see the stack

03:22.804 --> 03:25.054
of books by her cot... Tolstoy, Voltaire.

03:25.105 --> 03:28.358
What progress have you made with
plutonium alloys for shaping?

03:28.392 --> 03:30.143
Aluminum reacts with the alpha particles,

03:30.145 --> 03:33.813
but gallium is a real possibility.

03:35.065 --> 03:38.902
But Jeannie's favorite is Charles Dickens.

03:38.953 --> 03:41.871
Now I think it's because she's an orphan.

03:41.906 --> 03:43.323
Isn't that sad?

03:43.374 --> 03:45.491
Did you find the melting point?

03:45.542 --> 03:47.410
Somewhere in the range of 900 kelvin.

03:47.461 --> 03:50.496
How did you know that Mrs.
Winter was the girl for you?

03:50.498 --> 03:54.384
Was it a eureka like Einstein
discovering special relativity?

03:54.418 --> 03:55.969
That took Albert a couple of years.

03:55.994 --> 03:59.345
- Okay, but with Jeannie...
- Look, if we want more plutonium,

03:59.473 --> 04:02.759
we have to prove that we know what we're
doing with this miniscule amount we have.

04:02.810 --> 04:05.228
X-10 Reactor goes critical this week.

04:05.262 --> 04:07.764
By Christmas, they're gonna
be pumping out plutonium.

04:07.815 --> 04:09.983
So I don't need possibilities, Fritz.

04:10.017 --> 04:11.966
I don't need ranges.

04:12.520 --> 04:14.354
I need real data.

04:28.752 --> 04:31.454
Thought we only got poked
and prodded once a month.

04:33.874 --> 04:36.709
See more of you than I
do my wife these days.

04:41.048 --> 04:43.599
Something wrong with my
last urine collection?

04:45.436 --> 04:47.890
Fit as a bull moose, Mr. Isaacs.

04:48.897 --> 04:52.166
Just establishing your
baseline before your big trip.

04:53.594 --> 04:54.945
What trip?

05:00.117 --> 05:02.068
We're not shipping you off to Guadalcanal.

05:02.119 --> 05:03.536
This is a good thing.

05:03.570 --> 05:05.238
Gerald, give us a moment.

05:17.051 --> 05:18.584
Forgive the cloak and dagger,

05:18.586 --> 05:21.838
but the army can't have
functioning nuclear reactor

05:21.889 --> 05:23.506
on its travel bulletin.

05:24.758 --> 05:26.559
The reactor's gone critical.

05:26.593 --> 05:30.205
We're about to have our very own plutonium
factory. If our colleagues don't wipe

05:30.230 --> 05:32.216
the Confederate states
off the face of the Earth.

05:32.241 --> 05:34.761
You leave for Tennessee tomorrow morning.

05:35.270 --> 05:37.140
Tomorrow morning?

05:37.165 --> 05:38.699
It's just...

05:40.227 --> 05:42.020
- Um...
- What?

05:42.045 --> 05:43.545
I've never flown in a plane before.

05:44.853 --> 05:45.945
And...

05:47.781 --> 05:49.916
honestly,

05:49.950 --> 05:53.286
I get queasy when I'm too
high up at Fenway Park.

05:56.673 --> 05:58.153
Charlie,

06:00.044 --> 06:03.513
for weeks you're been sitting at your desk

06:03.547 --> 06:06.966
hoping I wouldn't notice you eyeing
the clock like a high school senior.

06:07.017 --> 06:09.936
Look, I know you have certain
reservations about the project.

06:10.506 --> 06:12.305
But in less than 72 hours,

06:12.356 --> 06:15.638
the world's second nuclear
reactor is going to go hot.

06:16.144 --> 06:18.728
Now, you want to sit in the
nosebleed seats of history?

06:19.797 --> 06:22.021
Or do you want to sit in the dugout?

06:22.866 --> 06:24.951
So it's our second anniversary

06:24.985 --> 06:29.055
and there is Frank cradling
this unwrapped brown box

06:29.089 --> 06:30.706
like it is the Ark of the Covenant.

06:30.741 --> 06:32.792
He never remembers our anniversary.

06:32.826 --> 06:35.878
And inside the box is a rabbit.

06:35.913 --> 06:39.999
Now, Frank tells me it is
a symbol of our marriage.

06:40.033 --> 06:42.835
Something about a spirit of curiosity

06:42.870 --> 06:44.437
and a keen mating instinct.

06:44.471 --> 06:45.671
Okay.

06:45.673 --> 06:47.840
Anyway, a week later, this rabbit

06:47.842 --> 06:49.759
is covered in sores

06:49.810 --> 06:52.011
and it's banging its head
against the side of the cage.

06:52.062 --> 06:54.299
And the next thing I
know, the rabbit is dead.

06:54.324 --> 06:56.649
Well, I hope you gave the
breeder a piece of your mind.

06:56.683 --> 06:58.234
Breeder?

06:58.268 --> 07:02.021
Frank stole the rabbit from
the natural sciences lab.

07:02.072 --> 07:04.073
But he failed to notice the poor creature

07:04.108 --> 07:06.325
was an infectious diseases study.

07:07.297 --> 07:09.028
Treponema cuniculi.

07:09.079 --> 07:11.551
Oh, you gave your wife
syphilis. That's nice.

07:11.576 --> 07:13.583
Never was very good at biology.

07:13.617 --> 07:17.058
He has other qualities to redeem him.

07:17.245 --> 07:18.704
The only cook in the house.

07:18.755 --> 07:20.756
Beef Bourguignon.

07:20.791 --> 07:23.042
Salt recklessly.

07:23.710 --> 07:25.105
Oh.

07:25.796 --> 07:28.681
Well, isn't this romantic?

07:31.101 --> 07:33.052
Oh, Helen.

07:50.320 --> 07:52.321
- You're done?
- Yeah.

07:52.372 --> 07:54.790
Oh.

07:54.825 --> 07:58.077
Oh, God.

07:58.079 --> 07:59.662
- Okay.
- Oh, God.

07:59.713 --> 08:02.081
What's this?

08:07.760 --> 08:09.711
They're playing
"Casablanca" at the theater.

08:11.475 --> 08:15.344
Or we could just talk.

08:17.147 --> 08:19.232
What do you want to talk about?

08:19.266 --> 08:21.317
Um...

08:21.351 --> 08:25.238
Did you do good science today?

08:28.609 --> 08:30.526
You know what, Corporal?

08:30.577 --> 08:32.695
I have an early morning.

08:33.990 --> 08:36.115
Why don't you take me home?

08:36.116 --> 08:40.419
Or, no, drop me off at the PX.

08:44.291 --> 08:47.376
You haven't told anyone
about this, have you?

08:47.427 --> 08:49.378
That I'm dating a genius?

08:49.673 --> 08:51.547
We're not dating.

08:56.503 --> 08:57.670
Abby.

09:03.393 --> 09:05.144
- Hey.
- Hello.

09:05.698 --> 09:07.396
What are you doing?

09:08.051 --> 09:09.899
I lied.

09:11.105 --> 09:12.735
I told you I read your paper.

09:12.786 --> 09:14.687
I picked it up about 10 times last year,

09:14.721 --> 09:17.490
but I never got past the first paragraph.

09:17.524 --> 09:19.458
Now I want to finish.

09:20.612 --> 09:21.794
Why?

09:22.174 --> 09:24.664
This part about bending light waves,

09:24.666 --> 09:27.166
is that like a prism? We had one at school.

09:27.217 --> 09:28.751
- Abby.
- Hmm?

09:29.391 --> 09:31.053
Put it away.

09:32.839 --> 09:34.757
What?

09:35.638 --> 09:37.510
You ever gonna let it go?

09:38.255 --> 09:40.322
I just wanted to read it.

09:41.354 --> 09:43.266
This is about Frank Winter.

09:45.152 --> 09:46.435
Ever since you got that call,

09:46.486 --> 09:47.737
you haven't looked at me the same.

09:47.771 --> 09:49.355
That's ridiculous.

09:49.406 --> 09:51.440
I didn't go to Milton
Academy like your father.

09:51.491 --> 09:52.992
I don't have a trust fund.

09:53.026 --> 09:55.361
Guess that means I
cheated my way in, right?

09:55.412 --> 09:57.747
You are the only person I know

09:57.781 --> 10:00.366
who thinks a decent upbringing
is something to be ashamed of.

10:03.870 --> 10:05.705
Where's my suitcase?

10:05.707 --> 10:06.988
Why?

10:07.207 --> 10:09.138
I have to go on a trip tomorrow.

10:09.753 --> 10:11.961
I don't know when I'll be back.

10:12.129 --> 10:14.430
You'll have lots of time
to catch up on your reading.

10:16.850 --> 10:19.051
I am going to prove that
it was army pesticides

10:19.053 --> 10:20.720
and then I'm going to take
it to the town council.

10:20.722 --> 10:23.055
The combined IQ of the town council

10:23.106 --> 10:24.995
is probably half of yours.

10:25.020 --> 10:27.373
Come to the meeting with
me Saturday, won't you?

10:27.477 --> 10:29.612
Frank refuses.

10:29.646 --> 10:32.648
Well, if you two are done conspiring,
I think we should get back.

10:32.699 --> 10:35.067
But there is one more
little thing before you go.

10:37.120 --> 10:39.405
You know, the Nazis say they cause cancer.

10:39.407 --> 10:41.707
Actually, it's a little bigger than this.

10:41.742 --> 10:43.909
I need a contrast microscope

10:43.960 --> 10:46.078
if I'm gonna shore up
my case against the army.

10:46.080 --> 10:48.447
Do you think you could smuggle
one out of the lab for me?

10:48.482 --> 10:50.716
I wish we could.

10:50.751 --> 10:52.918
Roosevelt couldn't get his wheelchair

10:52.920 --> 10:55.254
out of the tech area
without the army's say-so.

10:56.840 --> 10:58.090
Thank you, my dear.

10:58.092 --> 10:59.842
- Good night.
- Good night.

11:24.117 --> 11:26.252
Uh...

11:46.523 --> 11:51.143
Make clear all areas on
designation six through nine.

11:51.145 --> 11:53.145
Make clear all areas...

11:53.987 --> 11:55.614
Jeannie.

11:55.649 --> 11:58.284
I waited all night for you to knock.

11:58.318 --> 12:01.237
Oh, I'm so sorry. I've
been chained to my desk.

12:01.288 --> 12:04.457
But I have been driving the
warden crazy talking about you.

12:06.159 --> 12:08.327
I cut it into triangles the way you like

12:08.378 --> 12:10.663
in case you don't make it to breakfast.

12:15.502 --> 12:17.420
You made me a PB&J?

12:21.228 --> 12:22.729
It's $2.50.

12:23.844 --> 12:25.311
For the sandwich?

12:25.345 --> 12:27.096
For last night.

12:27.147 --> 12:30.816
I'm sorry. I have a
24-hours cancellation policy.

12:30.851 --> 12:32.685
Sure, sure.

12:41.995 --> 12:43.696
Bye.

12:43.698 --> 12:45.348
Bye.

14:23.213 --> 14:25.431
Oh! What the...

14:25.465 --> 14:29.051
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

14:35.185 --> 14:37.114
You'll be traveling under an assumed name.

14:37.139 --> 14:38.162
Yes, sir.

14:38.196 --> 14:40.748
The workers at Site X barely know
what they're making down there

14:40.799 --> 14:42.082
much less what it's used for.

14:42.133 --> 14:44.001
Let's take a look under the hood

14:44.026 --> 14:46.728
and make sure we're not
blowing a 20-kiloton gasket.

14:48.109 --> 14:50.861
They must have a team of experts
making sure that won't happen.

14:50.912 --> 14:53.113
Let's just say the army is
more concerned with secrecy

14:53.164 --> 14:55.332
than they are with something
as trivial as public safety.

14:55.367 --> 14:57.618
Nothing goes forward without
your say-so down there, Charlie.

14:59.087 --> 15:01.449
I thought you said I was
the only man for the job.

15:03.488 --> 15:05.125
You are.

15:06.878 --> 15:08.679
Occasionally we have to
throw implosion a bone

15:08.713 --> 15:11.348
to keep them from chewing
through their leashes.

15:11.383 --> 15:12.850
- Sir.
- Have a good trip.

15:12.884 --> 15:14.476
Thank you.

15:15.431 --> 15:18.284
Be careful at the airport.

15:18.640 --> 15:20.898
You know, there are thieves everywhere.

15:21.810 --> 15:24.895
Charlie, you want to get these?

15:33.386 --> 15:35.539
My father was knighted by King George

15:35.573 --> 15:37.958
and yet Frank sends a
little Dutch girl to Site X.

15:37.993 --> 15:40.527
Well, Helen's got more
degrees than a thermometer.

15:40.562 --> 15:42.579
You are just jealous.

15:42.631 --> 15:45.165
Close the door. We could
lose it in the wind.

15:46.751 --> 15:48.836
Looks like you've already lost it, Louis.

15:48.870 --> 15:50.738
I was reducing the metal and there was...

15:50.772 --> 15:53.741
an unexpected reaction.
We're missing 24 micrograms.

15:53.775 --> 15:55.476
Of plutonium?

15:55.510 --> 15:58.178
You've misplaced a million
dollars' worth of Pu-239?

15:58.229 --> 16:01.065
The Snoop's going haywire,
but I swiped the floor clean

16:01.099 --> 16:03.368
and the oil paper's good.

16:04.853 --> 16:07.604
We'll find it. Plutonium
doesn't just evaporate.

16:07.656 --> 16:10.107
Our careers will when
Oppenheimer gets wind of this.

16:10.158 --> 16:12.026
Okay.

16:29.127 --> 16:31.178
Mine's not making a sound.

16:31.212 --> 16:33.380
Nope, nor mine.

16:33.431 --> 16:36.633
This one must be busted.

16:36.685 --> 16:39.219
It beeps everywhere I look, but
nothing shows up under the scope.

16:39.270 --> 16:41.271
- Here, let me see it.
- Yeah.

17:01.960 --> 17:04.328
We need a medic.

17:07.582 --> 17:09.299
You moving to Tennessee?

17:10.667 --> 17:12.636
I packed less when I left for Harvard.

17:12.670 --> 17:15.055
That word rolls so easy off your tongue.

17:15.089 --> 17:16.839
"Can you pass the sugar?
I went to Harvard."

17:16.891 --> 17:18.759
How many pairs of clogs do you need?

17:18.810 --> 17:21.478
By the way, I found a problem
with your little space paper.

17:22.315 --> 17:24.515
The word is affect, not effect.

17:24.566 --> 17:26.599
A typo on page six.

17:26.602 --> 17:28.102
Embarrassing.

17:28.104 --> 17:29.319
Hello.

17:29.354 --> 17:31.271
Tickets, please.

17:31.322 --> 17:32.495
Yeah.

17:39.147 --> 17:41.365
Mr. and Mrs. Donaldson.

17:41.838 --> 17:43.288
That's us.

17:43.313 --> 17:44.952
Right, honey pie?

17:45.003 --> 17:48.255
Must be quite the big shot to fly
your wife to the Smoky Mountains.

17:48.289 --> 17:50.758
Oh, actually, I've been supporting Billy

17:50.792 --> 17:52.626
since his hunting accident.

17:52.628 --> 17:55.295
It doesn't matter to me that
he can't hold down a job...

17:55.346 --> 17:57.181
or have children.

17:57.215 --> 17:59.299
Oh.

18:01.519 --> 18:03.270
Double the saline bolus.

18:03.304 --> 18:05.639
Siphon in 10-mil increments.

18:05.641 --> 18:07.975
Hypernatremia measurements q-two minutes.

18:14.149 --> 18:16.450
Mr. Fedowitz. You're awake.

18:16.484 --> 18:18.285
Did you vomit in the other room?

18:18.319 --> 18:20.887
- I think I'm okay.
- But did you vomit again?

18:21.790 --> 18:23.540
Don't worry. I got it all in the garbage.

18:23.575 --> 18:25.766
Nurse, go retrieve the bin.

18:26.496 --> 18:30.214
Mr. Fedowitz, you swallowed a
significant quantity of plutonium.

18:31.749 --> 18:35.002
Priority is to retrieve every
microgram from your stomach.

18:36.337 --> 18:38.172
A man of your expertise,

18:38.223 --> 18:40.977
surely you know how to separate
heavy metals from organic matter.

18:48.316 --> 18:50.184
Here you go, ma'am.

18:50.235 --> 18:52.352
Sprinkle this baby on your windowsill

18:52.354 --> 18:55.355
and those termites of yours will
be gone in a New Mexico minute.

18:55.406 --> 18:58.859
This is what the army uses as pesticide?

18:59.601 --> 19:00.777
DDT?

19:00.829 --> 19:03.664
Uncle Sam sprays it on
our cots, our clothes,

19:03.698 --> 19:05.249
even our dinner plates.

19:05.283 --> 19:06.834
And the kids love it, too.

19:06.868 --> 19:08.255
Adios, head lice.

19:08.753 --> 19:12.039
Do you know what happens to a
mosquito exposed to organochlorides?

19:12.900 --> 19:15.375
Sodium channels blow
open the sensory nerves.

19:15.426 --> 19:19.296
The insect has a seizure and then
bleeds internally until the organs fail.

19:19.347 --> 19:21.215
Hmm.

19:21.217 --> 19:22.933
Good thing we're not mosquitos, right?

19:22.967 --> 19:24.731
Right.

19:25.253 --> 19:27.004
Or bees.

19:31.309 --> 19:33.977
Frank is going to kill me. Or worse.

19:34.028 --> 19:36.230
Hey, keep your head high.

19:36.956 --> 19:39.116
It'll give his blade a
clear path to your neck.

19:39.150 --> 19:42.236
- Less painful that way.
- Maybe we don't tell him.

19:42.238 --> 19:45.072
You know, just say that you're still
working on the alloy experiments.

19:45.123 --> 19:47.574
That'll buy us enough time to...

19:51.045 --> 19:53.163
Is this a lab or a wax museum?

19:54.799 --> 19:56.677
Just trying to win a war.

19:56.702 --> 19:58.669
- Once more unto the breach.
- What happened?

20:00.749 --> 20:04.335
There was a rapid vapor
expansion of the Pu-239 and...

20:05.182 --> 20:06.476
I swallowed some.

20:06.511 --> 20:08.645
Jesus, Fritz. How much?

20:09.650 --> 20:10.814
All of it.

20:10.879 --> 20:13.131
All right, you two, get out.

20:17.355 --> 20:20.190
Look, I already separated four micrograms.

20:20.241 --> 20:22.025
I'll get the rest with
dilution and recapture.

20:22.076 --> 20:23.744
I swear on my father's grave.

20:23.778 --> 20:26.280
I mean, actually, he was cremated, but...

20:26.331 --> 20:28.115
What did they say at the clinic?

20:28.117 --> 20:30.250
They are confident that
we can get it all back.

20:30.285 --> 20:32.452
You swallowed a radioactive isotope.

20:32.503 --> 20:33.670
What did the doctor prescribe?

20:33.705 --> 20:36.206
Aspirin and a case of beer.

20:36.257 --> 20:38.759
I'm supposed to drink it and
then I collect all my urine.

20:40.962 --> 20:43.483
How do you feel?

20:44.842 --> 20:46.800
What? Um...

20:48.052 --> 20:51.052
I guess I'm a little buzzed from the beer.

20:51.807 --> 20:53.453
Why, should I be worried?

20:53.975 --> 20:56.443
He's within the acceptable limits.

20:56.477 --> 20:59.363
I followed the Q-9 medical
directive to the letter.

20:59.397 --> 21:01.231
Who wrote the Q-9 directive?

21:02.283 --> 21:03.784
That's classified.

21:03.818 --> 21:05.202
Show me the study it's based on.

21:05.236 --> 21:07.287
Fedowitz's urine and blood samples

21:07.322 --> 21:10.624
have been sent via post to the project's
radiation expert for more testing.

21:10.658 --> 21:13.460
Do you know the speed at which
plutonium emits alpha particles?

21:13.494 --> 21:15.379
One-twentieth the speed of light.

21:15.413 --> 21:17.798
Do you know its biological half-life?

21:17.832 --> 21:20.667
- Well, I am sure...
- 200 years.

21:20.718 --> 21:23.170
Longer than the United
States has been a country.

21:23.221 --> 21:25.722
So why d't pick up the phone
and call the medical director

21:25.757 --> 21:27.841
for the project and get
him down here to examine...

21:27.892 --> 21:30.177
I don't need the director.
I've been given the authority

21:30.228 --> 21:32.396
to handle all health-related
matters on this Hill.

21:32.430 --> 21:35.849
Had you even heard the word plutonium
before you washed up on this base?

21:37.346 --> 21:39.514
What did you do your residency in, Doctor?

21:39.821 --> 21:41.738
- Obstetrics.
- Ah.

21:41.773 --> 21:43.857
Yet you felt confident treating a man

21:43.859 --> 21:46.159
who swallowed a quarter
of the world's supply

21:46.194 --> 21:50.614
of Pu-239 with a case of beer.

22:00.875 --> 22:02.676
Get me the War Department.

22:20.335 --> 22:22.502
Welcome to our humble abode.

22:22.527 --> 22:25.778
50,000 acres using 10% of
the nation's electricity,

22:25.803 --> 22:27.888
and it doesn't exist on any map.

22:27.956 --> 22:30.040
We have three schools, two movie theaters.

22:30.091 --> 22:32.092
We import 30,000 pounds
of mayonnaise a month.

22:32.127 --> 22:33.961
You know how many sandwiches that is?

22:34.012 --> 22:36.714
Mr. Ellis, how much product do you think
you'll turn out by the end of the year?

22:36.716 --> 22:39.800
And, of course, our most precious
resource, these talented young ladies.

22:39.851 --> 22:42.219
Most of them came straight from
high school to serve their nation.

22:42.270 --> 22:43.971
Pretty little patriots, aren't they?

22:44.022 --> 22:46.941
What's the evacuation protocol
in case of radiologic accident?

22:46.975 --> 22:48.726
Expect they can find the front door.

22:48.777 --> 22:51.695
We received the War Department's
R-23 directive a month ago.

22:51.730 --> 22:54.198
I put it on your desk.

22:54.232 --> 22:57.568
And I'm sure I told you to circulate
the directive to the girls, Theodore.

22:58.287 --> 23:01.121
We've been a little busy preparing
for tomorrow's festivities.

23:01.156 --> 23:03.207
Are you excited to make
your mark in history?

23:03.241 --> 23:06.327
Actually, I'm going to
load the last uranium rod.

23:06.378 --> 23:09.663
I have no doubt you know how
to work a rod, young lady,

23:09.714 --> 23:13.083
but instructions are that Mr.
Donaldson is to initiate the reaction.

23:13.085 --> 23:15.252
We'll see about that.

23:15.303 --> 23:18.005
Of course you can hand off
the honors to your lovely wife.

23:18.056 --> 23:19.869
Or whoever she is.

23:19.894 --> 23:21.952
Soon as we get back
home, Mrs. Donaldson and I

23:21.977 --> 23:23.761
are filing for divorce.

23:28.900 --> 23:31.032
Meet the X-10 Reactor.

23:31.057 --> 23:33.725
600,000 pounds of graphite.

23:33.850 --> 23:36.106
She's dressed and ready for her cotillion.

23:39.110 --> 23:41.111
All reactors should be female.

23:41.113 --> 23:43.113
Mmm. This is Bill Tupper,

23:43.164 --> 23:44.949
our operations chief.

23:44.974 --> 23:46.424
How are you?

23:46.452 --> 23:48.335
In 12 hours she'll start spinning

23:48.370 --> 23:50.204
uranium straw into plutonium gold.

23:50.255 --> 23:53.173
No, she won't. The reactor's
not going critical tomorrow.

23:53.208 --> 23:55.342
Oh, Jews are born pessimists.

23:55.377 --> 23:57.044
That's why I'm loading the last rod.

23:57.095 --> 23:58.679
No one's loading anything until we tour

23:58.713 --> 24:00.464
the whole facility, make sure it's safe.

24:00.466 --> 24:02.871
We have 140 buildings.
She'll be here till Easter.

24:02.896 --> 24:04.501
We have technical schematics

24:04.526 --> 24:05.545
- you could look at.
- Theodore.

24:05.570 --> 24:07.688
They diagram every
vulnerability on the site.

24:07.722 --> 24:09.557
More comprehensive than any physical tour.

24:09.608 --> 24:13.227
Safety's a priority, but the army's
deadlines are gospel around here.

24:13.292 --> 24:16.146
You're here to grease the
wheels, not gum up the works.

24:16.181 --> 24:19.066
What I'm here to do is make sure
you don't set the atmosphere on fire.

24:19.117 --> 24:21.485
He's overeating. It's just a formality.

24:21.536 --> 24:25.322
Look, I understand you've been sent
down here by some high mucky-muck.

24:25.324 --> 24:29.126
That mucky-muck hired the guy who
hired the guy who hired your boss.

24:29.160 --> 24:31.045
His name is Robert Oppenheimer.

24:31.751 --> 24:33.585
Let's see those schematics.

24:42.040 --> 24:46.927
♪ First you swallow our plutonium ♪

24:46.978 --> 24:51.815
♪ Now you're going
to piss it all away. ♪

24:52.154 --> 24:54.488
Jeannie helped me collect
three liters of urine.

24:56.521 --> 24:58.606
A good woman is hard to find.

24:58.657 --> 25:01.025
Oh, by the way, could one of
you guys front me five bucks?

25:01.076 --> 25:03.307
What, are you taking
her out as a thank-you?

25:03.332 --> 25:05.613
No, he's paying her for sex.

25:05.664 --> 25:06.914
You are?

25:06.948 --> 25:08.415
Thank you.

25:08.450 --> 25:11.201
Well, no, not exactly.

25:11.252 --> 25:14.371
We haven't really gone all the way yet.

25:15.115 --> 25:17.091
So you're paying her
not to have sex with you?

25:18.619 --> 25:21.545
Fritz, you do know most women
would probably do that for free?

25:22.551 --> 25:24.214
All girls cost money.

25:24.216 --> 25:25.966
You buy them dinner, drinks.

25:26.017 --> 25:29.219
With Jeannie, there's none
of that. Just a flat fee.

25:34.309 --> 25:37.194
I phoned Berkeley, Chicago, Manhattan.

25:37.228 --> 25:39.596
They passed me to a
different doctor every time.

25:39.631 --> 25:42.031
You don't even know the name
of your own goddamn boss.

25:42.056 --> 25:44.301
The post office handles
the blood and urine samples.

25:44.326 --> 25:47.237
We're only supposed to get a response
from his team if there's a problem.

25:47.262 --> 25:49.323
- There's never been one before.
- Jesus Christ.

25:49.348 --> 25:50.708
Compartmentalization.

25:50.742 --> 25:52.459
They've never even shown me an org chart.

25:53.524 --> 25:56.130
Army doesn't want anyone
knowing who's in charge.

25:56.164 --> 25:58.499
There's an administrator in New York

25:58.550 --> 26:02.252
who supposedly has the org chart
and the name of the ranking doctor.

26:02.254 --> 26:05.889
- Who's he?
- His ID is 482.

26:05.924 --> 26:07.841
I've left him three messages.

26:07.866 --> 26:09.707
- Give me his number.
- This line needs to stay

26:09.732 --> 26:11.081
free for emergencies.

26:12.373 --> 26:15.041
What exactly do you think this is?

26:18.520 --> 26:20.654
Bang! Bang, bang!

26:20.689 --> 26:22.773
Bang, bang, bang!

26:32.500 --> 26:34.418
Hi, Abby.

26:34.452 --> 26:36.370
Hello.

26:37.311 --> 26:39.033
Picking up Callie from school?

26:39.058 --> 26:41.905
Please, she'd die if she saw me here.

26:41.930 --> 26:43.844
- Oh, hmm.
- Just stealing a microscope

26:43.878 --> 26:46.964
from the best equipped elementary
school science room in the country.

26:47.015 --> 26:50.601
- Mum's the word.
- I didn't see anything.

26:50.635 --> 26:53.887
Frank tells me that you're
spending your days in switchboard.

26:55.890 --> 26:57.691
Oh, it's only part-time.

26:57.726 --> 26:59.702
Better than no time, trust me.

27:00.028 --> 27:03.781
It's nice to have something to
distract you while your husband's gone.

27:04.312 --> 27:06.200
Oh, did Frank go, too?

27:06.234 --> 27:09.153
No, I just saw Charlie
this morning at the gate.

27:09.978 --> 27:12.456
With Helen Prins and a mountain of luggage.

27:12.490 --> 27:15.993
Off on some top secret mission, I presume.

27:15.995 --> 27:18.746
Who is Helen Prins?

27:20.999 --> 27:24.134
Uranium-235 is highly unstable.

27:24.169 --> 27:26.386
Store too much in one place,

27:26.421 --> 27:28.472
you can set off a chain reaction.

27:28.506 --> 27:30.257
Which is why we split it
up so there's never more

27:30.308 --> 27:32.176
than 12 kilograms in any given building.

27:32.227 --> 27:34.178
This isn't rocket science.

27:34.180 --> 27:36.148
So how do you transport it?

27:36.431 --> 27:39.733
Uranium enters the
reactor through this valve

27:39.768 --> 27:41.602
at a rate of 24 milligrams per second.

27:41.653 --> 27:43.198
What if a valve fails?

27:43.355 --> 27:45.489
If uranium accumulates
in the pipes, you could...

27:45.523 --> 27:49.109
All the valves are redundant,
like this conversation.

27:49.160 --> 27:51.829
Plant's designed so if
any one valve gets clogged,

27:51.863 --> 27:53.497
another one comes to the rescue.

27:53.531 --> 27:56.361
What about this one?
There's no redundancy there.

27:56.386 --> 27:58.702
That's not a valve. That's a window.

28:00.038 --> 28:02.039
You've got a busy day, Mr. Ellis.

28:02.090 --> 28:05.042
If it would be helpful, I can
walk our guests through the plants.

28:05.044 --> 28:06.844
Compartmentalization, Theodore.

28:06.878 --> 28:08.679
I don't think Washington would like that.

28:08.713 --> 28:10.464
But I could use some coffee.

28:12.209 --> 28:14.460
This is where the separation takes place?

28:14.636 --> 28:16.937
- The cauldron starts here.
- Uh-huh.

28:22.443 --> 28:24.812
When I get dismissed by a group of men,

28:24.863 --> 28:27.786
it usually means they're
afraid of what I'm about to say.

28:28.566 --> 28:30.175
It's Mrs. Donaldson, correct?

28:30.200 --> 28:32.236
This isn't the Underground Railroad.

28:32.270 --> 28:34.805
I don't need a woman to
rescue me from the white man.

28:35.269 --> 28:37.754
I'm not here to rescue anyone.

28:38.827 --> 28:41.411
But no one else in that room
gives a shit what you think.

28:44.582 --> 28:45.916
Green water.

28:54.124 --> 28:56.992
Clear vats 14 and 15 from building 90-207.

28:57.026 --> 29:01.330
They're, what, eight
and a half feet from 206?

29:01.364 --> 29:02.915
Who the hell drew these?

29:02.949 --> 29:05.117
Some third-rate architect
from the Corps of Engineers?

29:05.168 --> 29:06.785
- Are you a draftsman?
- Draftswoman.

29:06.836 --> 29:09.204
This rendering is off by six inches.

29:09.239 --> 29:11.590
Add up 206, 207, and 208

29:11.624 --> 29:13.342
and we're still under the safety limits.

29:13.376 --> 29:16.011
Yeah, for fast neutrons. But
we're talking about green water.

29:16.045 --> 29:17.713
Green water?

29:18.158 --> 29:20.319
Uranium dissolved in liquid form.

29:20.476 --> 29:23.165
The neutrons slow down and
become 100 times more effective.

29:23.190 --> 29:25.988
- So what?
- 100 times more fissionable.

29:26.022 --> 29:28.307
All these buildings will go up in smoke.

29:28.358 --> 29:29.775
You need to clear every one of them.

29:29.809 --> 29:32.728
4,000 vats spread over 100 acres?

29:32.779 --> 29:36.430
-  It'll take a week.
- I need a word alone.

29:36.704 --> 29:38.400
Don't look at me.

29:39.659 --> 29:41.003
You heard my wife.

29:43.239 --> 29:44.323
Medical Division.

29:44.374 --> 29:46.291
Get your boss on the phone now.

29:46.326 --> 29:47.826
This is number G-11.

29:47.877 --> 29:50.891
11? One moment, please.
I'll get him right away.

29:51.009 --> 29:52.381
G-11?

29:52.415 --> 29:55.751
Didn't know they even
made ID numbers that low.

29:55.753 --> 29:58.420
I understand you've got
yourself a situation.

29:58.422 --> 30:01.590
You need to talk to the
project radiation chief.

30:01.641 --> 30:03.684
Well, who is he?

30:03.723 --> 30:04.927
Never spoken to him myself.

30:04.929 --> 30:08.096
But I know all the urine and blood
samples go to his lab for testing.

30:08.098 --> 30:10.182
He sets the acceptable limits.

30:10.233 --> 30:13.101
ID number is...

30:13.706 --> 30:15.512
B-379.

30:15.537 --> 30:17.838
Fine, have your girl put me through.

30:20.101 --> 30:21.351
Marge.

30:29.452 --> 30:31.286
Health Division.

30:31.288 --> 30:33.505
Is this B-379?

30:34.640 --> 30:36.170
Dr. Winter?

30:49.681 --> 30:51.640
It doesn't make any sense.

30:52.706 --> 30:54.622
What exactly did he say?

30:54.647 --> 30:56.004
That you were receiving shipments

30:56.029 --> 30:58.447
and that you set the acceptable limits.

30:58.481 --> 31:01.967
The blood and urine samples
are sent to an outside team.

31:02.190 --> 31:05.342
My assistant drops them at
the post office every Monday.

31:08.635 --> 31:11.916
Have you ever actually seen them
put the samples on the truck?

31:13.774 --> 31:15.778
This must be a misunderstanding.

31:17.195 --> 31:20.030
I have a week's training in radiology.

31:20.681 --> 31:23.433
Why would they put me in charge?

31:26.843 --> 31:28.977
Who hired you?

31:37.904 --> 31:39.821
Alek, we need to talk.

31:39.856 --> 31:42.941
I've made it clear I don't enjoy
being disturbed during my games.

31:42.966 --> 31:46.533
You handpicked the ranking
medical officer on the Hill.

31:46.870 --> 31:49.288
Just as Robert and I handpicked you.

31:49.832 --> 31:52.000
What do you want, Frank?

31:52.943 --> 31:55.422
It's all an illusion, isn't it?

31:55.469 --> 31:58.256
The Geiger measurements,
the urine and blood samples.

31:58.291 --> 32:01.426
What, are you just throwing
away the collections?

32:01.461 --> 32:04.963
Your man Fedowitz swallowed
24 micrograms of Pu-239.

32:05.014 --> 32:08.216
The toxic dose is 100 to 500 micrograms.

32:08.267 --> 32:10.267
Did you just invent those numbers?

32:10.338 --> 32:13.473
A range of 400 proves you have
no idea what you're talking about.

32:13.498 --> 32:15.640
Radiology is not your field, Frank.

32:15.692 --> 32:17.889
And it's not Dr. Adelman's either.

32:19.395 --> 32:21.630
You intentionally chose
a man who knows nothing

32:21.664 --> 32:25.741
about radiologic risks to
run our medical program.

32:29.277 --> 32:32.646
But you know plenty about
radiology, don't you, Alek?

32:33.576 --> 32:35.410
You spent six years with Marie Curie

32:35.461 --> 32:37.280
at the Pasteur Institute?

32:38.381 --> 32:40.549
- Seven, actually.
- Ah.

32:41.075 --> 32:44.077
That woman died blind and anemic.

32:44.971 --> 32:47.422
Her papers had to be quarantined.

32:48.537 --> 32:50.892
She went to her grave
denying that it was because

32:50.927 --> 32:54.903
she had been breathing in
radioactive dust for 40 years.

32:54.928 --> 32:56.429
If the history lesson is over...

32:56.463 --> 32:59.888
Glen Babbit tells me that Dr.
Curie could be very forthcoming

32:59.913 --> 33:01.464
after a few glasses of Bordeaux.

33:02.974 --> 33:05.308
She never let you handle any radium

33:05.333 --> 33:07.427
or polonium, did she, Alek?

33:07.574 --> 33:10.382
Dr. Curie didn't want anyone
to lay claim to her work.

33:10.407 --> 33:15.094
No. No, she let other students
handle ionizing elements.

33:15.119 --> 33:16.703
But she'd already buried a husband

33:16.728 --> 33:20.381
and she wouldn't expose the
young Hungarian physicist

33:20.406 --> 33:22.374
who was in love with her.

33:25.726 --> 33:28.327
Safety standards on the Hill

33:28.362 --> 33:31.467
have been approved by the Secretary of War.

33:31.492 --> 33:34.110
You can address your
complaints to the Pentagon.

33:34.135 --> 33:35.262
No.

33:36.471 --> 33:38.638
No more bureaucrats.

33:40.307 --> 33:42.706
Town council meets tomorrow morning.

33:42.731 --> 33:45.246
People need to know you're
running a Potemkin clinic

33:45.271 --> 33:47.216
and it's all a lie.

33:48.065 --> 33:50.983
Shout plutonium in a crowded theater,

33:51.484 --> 33:54.403
it won't just be your job, Dr. Winter.

33:55.269 --> 33:58.291
You could find yourself in military prison.

34:01.557 --> 34:03.225
Your record is six feet even.

34:03.845 --> 34:06.947
I'll wager you a half
bottle of my secret cologne

34:06.972 --> 34:08.473
you cannot make it to 10.

34:08.498 --> 34:11.420
Secret cologne? You smell
like Marmite, Crosley.

34:12.554 --> 34:16.347
I'll take the under for two
tickets to next week's movie.

34:16.379 --> 34:18.045
They're playing "This is the Army."

34:18.071 --> 34:20.322
Ooh!

34:20.347 --> 34:23.799
Oh, Jeannie loves Ronald Reagan.

34:25.438 --> 34:28.072
- Line it up.
- Yay!

34:28.098 --> 34:29.652
Line it up.

34:29.677 --> 34:31.928
- Line it up.
- Line it up.

34:37.934 --> 34:40.185
All right, prepared, are you?

34:40.667 --> 34:43.753
Crosley, these are what
American lungs look like.

34:47.206 --> 34:49.208
Oh!

34:49.259 --> 34:50.641
- Ha-ha!
- Unbelievable.

34:50.666 --> 34:52.081
Watch out, Ringling Brothers.

34:52.107 --> 34:54.641
Hold it. Hold on, hold
on. Hold on, hold on.

34:54.667 --> 34:56.634
Doc, Doc, Doc, Doc.

34:56.922 --> 34:59.519
Hey, how about a taste
of your own medicine?

34:59.553 --> 35:01.066
Uh, another time.

35:01.091 --> 35:02.558
Aw.

35:02.583 --> 35:04.901
That's the best doc in
the 48 states right there.

35:04.926 --> 35:06.459
Best doc.

35:06.484 --> 35:09.519
I'm gonna need a refill
on my script soon, Doc.

35:11.135 --> 35:14.304
- I love that guy.
- What's his name?

35:14.338 --> 35:16.256
I don't know.

35:28.334 --> 35:29.849
I thought you didn't approve.

35:30.179 --> 35:33.287
You burning the house down? I
don't. I'm here for your wife.

35:33.517 --> 35:35.602
- Where is she?
- No idea.

35:35.712 --> 35:36.712
Well...

35:37.598 --> 35:39.286
This is gonna be the best piece of theater

35:39.320 --> 35:41.671
since Oppenheimer was
an arsenic and old lace.

35:41.730 --> 35:42.730
Doctor Winter.

35:46.782 --> 35:48.582
Dr. Bureth paid me a visit.

35:49.826 --> 35:52.614
One of Louis' federals'
brother died fighting Rommel.

35:52.779 --> 35:55.246
The other is in the
Gilbert Islands, but Louis

35:55.271 --> 35:56.965
is here on your base.

35:57.001 --> 35:58.927
If you cut the sanctimonium
for a goddamn minute

35:58.952 --> 36:00.879
you'll hear me say I agree with you.

36:02.808 --> 36:04.008
Let's take a walk.

36:08.979 --> 36:11.536
I've told Army Medical
our standard was unworthy

36:11.561 --> 36:13.145
of this installation a month ago.

36:13.170 --> 36:15.588
We're understaffed and Dr.
Adelman's in over his head.

36:15.987 --> 36:17.569
The general shot me down.

36:17.594 --> 36:18.978
Then come back in there with me.

36:19.406 --> 36:20.913
Let's make a united front.

36:20.938 --> 36:22.495
I need you to look at something first.

36:23.155 --> 36:25.123
What is this?

36:28.057 --> 36:29.558
Who the hell is this?

36:29.876 --> 36:31.521
You didn't hear this from me.

36:31.572 --> 36:33.690
Command calls him Magpie.

36:33.741 --> 36:36.776
Could be a disgruntled bureaucrat
from Munich or Hitler's gardener.

36:36.778 --> 36:38.611
Either way, he has credible intelligence

36:38.662 --> 36:41.247
their atomic program is
two months ahead of ours.

36:45.030 --> 36:47.615
How do you know the Germans
didn't just plant him?

36:48.589 --> 36:50.373
This is Greek to me,

36:50.924 --> 36:53.793
but I'm sure those equations
mean something to you.

37:00.968 --> 37:02.719
Jesus.

37:02.770 --> 37:05.188
They're testing yields.

37:05.222 --> 37:06.673
What?

37:07.942 --> 37:09.957
They're testing a bomb.

37:11.516 --> 37:13.730
They're more than two months ahead of us.

37:13.781 --> 37:16.282
All right, our history
aside, if you go forward,

37:16.317 --> 37:18.484
I'll stand with you in there.

37:18.535 --> 37:22.372
But if we sound the alarm, it could
be weeks until we get back to work.

37:22.406 --> 37:24.382
Meantime, the Krauts could get there first

37:24.619 --> 37:27.070
and none of this makes a bit of difference.

38:07.201 --> 38:08.451
Hello?

38:08.502 --> 38:10.420
You got Prince Albert in a can?

38:11.556 --> 38:13.790
Charlie, we're not allowed
to take personal calls.

38:13.841 --> 38:15.291
Martha checks the phone logs.

38:15.342 --> 38:16.759
So pick an extension.

38:16.794 --> 38:18.711
Patch me through. Take the scenic route.

38:21.765 --> 38:23.182
Where are you?

38:23.217 --> 38:25.935
You tell people not to answer
that question all day long.

38:26.650 --> 38:28.187
I mean, are you working?

38:28.222 --> 38:29.522
I'm at the hotel.

38:30.319 --> 38:31.391
Must be nice.

38:31.468 --> 38:33.168
Whisked away on a vacation.

38:33.193 --> 38:34.777
Someone to fluff your pillows?

38:35.331 --> 38:38.765
Trust me, it's not the Plaza.

38:42.903 --> 38:44.537
You still there?

38:44.571 --> 38:45.950
Yes.

38:47.241 --> 38:49.075
I just...

38:51.593 --> 38:53.212
I wanted to hear your voice.

38:53.732 --> 38:55.748
Hope you're not too lonely,

38:56.449 --> 38:58.384
all by yourself on that business trip.

38:58.419 --> 39:00.219
I should have brought a book.

39:01.922 --> 39:04.307
My son bouncing off the walls?

39:05.219 --> 39:06.926
Actually, Joey has an earache.

39:06.928 --> 39:08.678
He was up crying all night.

39:08.729 --> 39:10.646
- It was very sad.
-  Abby, I'm sorry.

39:10.681 --> 39:12.849
Actually, we should go. We
have a doctor's appointment.

39:13.028 --> 39:16.297
Listen, I love you.

39:20.274 --> 39:22.275
Me, too.

39:27.748 --> 39:29.749
Get up.

39:31.903 --> 39:35.900
From now on, I'm the only
one who touches the plutonium.

39:39.710 --> 39:42.662
You obviously can't be trusted
with our limited supply.

40:05.069 --> 40:07.887
Oh, if it isn't the happy honeymooners.

40:07.921 --> 40:10.206
You'll be pleased to hear we
just got a clean bill of health

40:10.240 --> 40:11.908
on the storage room in building 9.

40:11.959 --> 40:13.377
- Good start.
- And we began

40:13.402 --> 40:14.768
loading rods an hour ago.

40:14.795 --> 40:16.440
- I can see that.
- The reactor will

40:16.465 --> 40:17.997
be fully operational within a day.

40:17.999 --> 40:20.083
We gave you a list of 22 major hazards

40:20.134 --> 40:21.918
to resolve before we go critical.

40:21.969 --> 40:25.204
And the army intends to give your
list the consideration it deserves.

40:25.239 --> 40:27.673
- When?
- Just as soon as we're critical.

40:27.675 --> 40:31.427
Now, if you'll excuse me. I've got a
300-ton block of graphite to attend to.

40:31.478 --> 40:34.430
- On whose authority?
- General Leslie Groves.

40:35.106 --> 40:37.850
He's the mucky-muck who
hired Robert Oppenheimer.

40:38.664 --> 40:41.216
Rest up. Tomorrow's a
big day for all of us.

40:50.664 --> 40:52.064
Hey.

40:52.099 --> 40:54.000
You didn't go to the town council?

40:54.034 --> 40:56.836
There was no acetylcholinesterase activity.

40:57.617 --> 41:00.440
So pesticides didn't kill the bees

41:00.474 --> 41:02.290
and it wasn't the army.

41:03.627 --> 41:05.761
Maybe it was a virus.

41:05.796 --> 41:07.578
A parasite.

41:09.074 --> 41:10.883
I ruled out infectious disease.

41:12.052 --> 41:13.803
Well, you'll figure it out.

41:14.805 --> 41:16.806
You always do.

41:19.143 --> 41:22.028
Do you think it can be
something from the tech area?

41:22.062 --> 41:24.707
I know you're working with chemicals and...

41:25.032 --> 41:27.483
what if the runoff was
dumped in Ashley Pond

41:27.534 --> 41:29.986
or there was a gas in the air?

41:34.158 --> 41:37.043
The safety and environmental protocols

41:37.077 --> 41:38.911
were vetted by experts.

41:40.086 --> 41:42.333
I read the reports myself.

41:43.988 --> 41:48.408
Frank, a bee colony doesn't
just collapse on its own.

41:49.840 --> 41:51.058
Well...

41:51.725 --> 41:54.010
wasn't the army...

41:55.229 --> 41:59.765
so it was phantom toxins in the tech area?

42:07.441 --> 42:09.775
You think this is all in my head?

42:23.557 --> 42:26.225
Let's find you some new bees.
