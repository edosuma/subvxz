00:28.448 --> 00:31.848
Let me tell you a story about
a young man called Oliver.

00:32.262 --> 00:34.515
There's no singing, no dancing.

00:34.757 --> 00:36.697
Definitely no happy ending.

00:37.355 --> 00:38.987
But before we get to me,

00:39.080 --> 00:42.108
this all started with a thief
called Tom Chitling.

00:50.080 --> 00:51.330
Hey you!

00:51.710 --> 00:52.991
Oi! Stop!

00:53.767 --> 00:55.017
Damn it!

00:55.875 --> 00:57.125
He's there!

01:11.167 --> 01:12.724
Oi! Stop!

01:18.931 --> 01:19.944
<i>♪ Here we go. ♪</i>

01:23.332 --> 01:24.381
<i>♪ Here we go. ♪</i>

01:42.637 --> 01:43.670
Come here!

01:43.723 --> 01:45.147
Where is it?

02:29.005 --> 02:31.207
Growing up it was just me and mum.

02:31.507 --> 02:33.233
We didn't have a lot.

02:33.622 --> 02:35.586
But we had our imagination.

02:36.053 --> 02:38.084
Where did you take us today, Oliver?

02:38.215 --> 02:40.914
It's a beach. And we had an ice cream.

02:41.036 --> 02:43.207
Hmm! Delicious.

02:43.515 --> 02:45.044
I took us...

02:45.135 --> 02:46.586
to the circus.

02:46.684 --> 02:49.033
Wow! Elephants.

02:49.130 --> 02:51.175
- Thanks, mum.
- You're welcome.

02:51.239 --> 02:54.010
I'm gonna take a summary
from better tomorrow.

02:56.287 --> 02:57.863
I can't wait.

03:01.362 --> 03:03.025
What do you see?

03:03.126 --> 03:04.804
A lady swimming.

03:05.311 --> 03:06.918
What else?

03:07.346 --> 03:09.112
What does all of this say?

03:09.499 --> 03:11.369
I don't understand, mum.

03:11.525 --> 03:12.940
Well...

03:13.162 --> 03:14.765
I see...

03:14.947 --> 03:16.300
escape.

03:17.150 --> 03:18.826
I see...

03:18.953 --> 03:22.473
a powerful woman leaving behind a life
that wasn't meant for her.

03:23.465 --> 03:25.049
And all of the flowers,

03:25.499 --> 03:27.340
they are telling us why.

03:28.837 --> 03:32.523
Anyone ever told you
you are a bit weird, mum?

03:33.109 --> 03:37.359
Has anyone ever told you
you're a bit cheeky?

03:40.752 --> 03:42.958
We're going to space now, are we?

03:43.040 --> 03:44.583
Yeah.

03:45.598 --> 03:48.827
I thought we were supposed to
be doing our dreams for the future.

03:49.952 --> 03:51.698
I don't get it.

03:51.722 --> 03:53.487
That's you.

03:53.511 --> 03:54.924
And that's me.

03:54.948 --> 03:56.524
And we're in a gallery.

03:56.549 --> 03:58.979
And we're looking at this painting
of you and me,

03:59.074 --> 04:00.233
in a gallery,

04:00.313 --> 04:02.327
looking at this painting
of you and me in a gallery,

04:02.351 --> 04:04.508
and it goes on and on and on...

04:05.341 --> 04:07.321
But nothing lasts forever.

04:13.697 --> 04:15.351
Then it was just me.

04:19.433 --> 04:20.603
Time to go, Oliver.

04:20.658 --> 04:22.333
I didn't know anyone else.

04:24.153 --> 04:25.966
Certainly, didn't belong with them.

04:30.564 --> 04:32.623
I was better off on my own.

04:42.179 --> 04:43.315
Oi!

04:43.339 --> 04:44.931
Wake up.

04:45.539 --> 04:46.948
Wake up, you little rat!

04:47.351 --> 04:49.315
Right, I've told you before,
and I'm not an idiot.

04:49.362 --> 04:51.396
I'm not gonna tell you again.

04:51.569 --> 04:52.816
Don't you dare.

04:52.840 --> 04:55.059
Sod off, you little spranger.

04:55.148 --> 04:57.453
Stop sleeping in the gallery!

04:57.477 --> 04:59.404
People don't really call me Oliver anymore.

04:59.518 --> 05:01.419
They call me TWIST.

05:01.527 --> 05:05.081

Congratulations, luv,
you own a little yellow square.

06:59.189 --> 07:00.771
You can see I have my hands full.

07:00.843 --> 07:02.213
They are not my rules.
I just enforce them.

07:02.237 --> 07:04.738
- I was right here.
- You were right here, but for too long.

07:04.813 --> 07:06.474
I thought you're gonna move in.

07:06.498 --> 07:08.051
Do you think I like doing this?

07:08.099 --> 07:10.655
Actually, I do. It makes
me feel big in every way.

07:10.749 --> 07:12.652
Could you not give the ticket
to anyone else?

07:12.677 --> 07:14.200
I'm not just giving
em to nice people.

07:14.224 --> 07:16.478
You look like a nice person,
so I've given one to you.

07:16.502 --> 07:18.132
Please, I was initially about to leave.

07:18.156 --> 07:19.394
Well, you should've left earlier,
shouldn't ya?

07:19.418 --> 07:20.641
I can't afford this ticket.

07:20.665 --> 07:24.214
Well, I can't afford a 4K TV but I wish
I could have liked one of those.

07:24.238 --> 07:27.511
Actually, I don't even know what it is
but I like the sound of wanting it, yeah?

07:27.535 --> 07:28.916
I wish I could have but...

07:28.940 --> 07:30.541
Please, please, please.

Yo, little man!

Yo?

08:37.121 --> 08:39.379
- Hey, slow up, bro.
- What?

08:40.097 --> 08:43.249
Relax man, the cops
packed in way back.

08:43.371 --> 08:46.644
- Why are you chasing me then?
- Cause you forgot your shopping.

08:49.249 --> 08:50.658
Okay.

08:55.326 --> 08:56.440
It's you, isn't it?

08:56.565 --> 08:58.728
- What?
- Do you know who it is?

08:59.115 --> 09:01.174
Come on man, we know that it's you.

09:01.299 --> 09:03.089
We done the forensics.

09:03.215 --> 09:04.247
Your spray cans.

09:04.319 --> 09:06.337
He is a joker, this one, but look, listen,

09:06.471 --> 09:07.522
I am Dodge

09:07.631 --> 09:10.127
this is Batesy and together we...

09:17.117 --> 09:18.263
What about your bike?

09:18.348 --> 09:19.638
Not ours, pal.

09:25.021 --> 09:26.271
Go!

09:26.937 --> 09:28.266
Come on.

09:32.877 --> 09:34.272
Stop!

09:35.071 --> 09:36.336
Wait!

09:36.926 --> 09:38.348
Come on. Let's go.

09:38.820 --> 09:40.482
Get down!

09:51.581 --> 09:52.966
Come on.

09:53.614 --> 09:56.058
Cracking set of pants, luv.

09:56.458 --> 09:58.271
What happened to him?

09:58.334 --> 09:59.317
Who is that?

09:59.341 --> 10:00.947
Brilliant. You two again.

10:00.971 --> 10:04.021
Oh come on, we are guardian angels.

10:04.045 --> 10:05.332
Where's the other guy?

10:05.356 --> 10:07.867
Come with us, we'll see what you got
with some new gear.

10:07.891 --> 10:11.435
Or you could just stay here,
I mean, it's up to you.

10:11.843 --> 10:13.928
We got trainers as well.

10:14.675 --> 10:16.041
Really?

10:16.243 --> 10:19.132
Come on, handsome, follow us.

10:22.847 --> 10:24.613
I ain't got anything worth stealing.

10:24.737 --> 10:28.119
Come on, mate. You can't go
through life trusting no one.

10:28.243 --> 10:30.096
Yeah, we saved your ass once already.

10:30.220 --> 10:31.778
That was the other guy.

10:31.902 --> 10:33.303
What? You mean Red?

10:33.427 --> 10:34.431
Yeah.

10:34.555 --> 10:36.601
The guy in the green jacket.

10:37.216 --> 10:39.231
That's a real hero, that one.

10:48.421 --> 10:50.174
<i>Entree s'il vous plait.</i>

10:57.105 --> 10:58.374
<i>Who's there?</i>

10:58.637 --> 11:00.502
Just me and Batesy.

11:00.718 --> 11:02.612
What size of waist are you?

11:02.736 --> 11:05.043
<i>I'd say about a thirty regular.</i>

11:05.167 --> 11:06.167
Who's that?

11:06.249 --> 11:10.536
Oh, that is the ghost of Dodge's grandpa.

11:10.930 --> 11:14.104
Batesy, shut up.
I'll introduce you later.

11:18.943 --> 11:22.489
- Let's get you some clothes first.
- You do realize that I've got no money?

11:22.613 --> 11:24.600
It's alright. You can ask.

11:24.674 --> 11:26.365
I don't like owing people.

11:28.333 --> 11:29.956
Go on, have them.

11:30.080 --> 11:32.680
Introductory, special offer.

11:32.804 --> 11:35.210
- We can spare 'em.
- Where did you get all this?

11:35.566 --> 11:38.701
- Sports warehouse.
- I lost my favourite hat on that job.

11:38.825 --> 11:41.847
Are you ever gonna stop
bragging on about that hat?

11:41.930 --> 11:42.867
Huh?

11:42.903 --> 11:44.130
Probably not.

11:44.254 --> 11:47.910
Have 'em. They cost us nothing.
Shops claimed insurance...

11:48.034 --> 11:49.061
plus...

11:49.185 --> 11:50.986
them pasty legs,

11:51.417 --> 11:53.503
they're gonna give me nightmares.

11:54.499 --> 11:58.185
Better give them that,
little bit of a shake actually.

11:58.309 --> 12:00.784
Let's give 'em a shake first, eh?

12:06.576 --> 12:08.305
Hey, Fagin.

12:09.778 --> 12:11.047
Dodge.

12:11.679 --> 12:15.558
I've told you before, you cannot bring in
green kids off the street.

12:15.682 --> 12:17.871
- I know, but Fagin...
- No buts.

12:18.151 --> 12:19.226
Out he goes.

12:19.350 --> 12:20.848
Fagin, please,

12:20.972 --> 12:22.365
this is Twist.

12:22.489 --> 12:26.188
Extreme graffiti artist,
reaching places others can't reach.

12:26.312 --> 12:29.302
Texts on the moving crane, all that.
You know like, what was his face...

12:29.426 --> 12:30.754
Banksy.

12:30.878 --> 12:34.029
Reaching places other people
can't reach, eh?

12:34.588 --> 12:36.633
The problem with graffiti is...

12:36.757 --> 12:37.914
You can't move it.

12:38.038 --> 12:40.733
What's the point in a painting
that's always in the same place?

12:40.857 --> 12:43.856
The higher up I put my work
the more people can see it.

12:44.352 --> 12:45.968
That's the point.

12:46.092 --> 12:47.607
Doesn't belong to anybody.

12:48.023 --> 12:49.768
An idealist, eh?

12:49.999 --> 12:51.697
All property is theft.

12:52.486 --> 12:54.215
In my case, that's

12:54.542 --> 12:55.842
literally true.

12:56.877 --> 12:59.488
Tell me Mr Idealist,

13:00.103 --> 13:02.427
how's virtue treating you?

13:02.551 --> 13:04.407
Is it filling your stomach?

13:04.538 --> 13:07.075
Can it give you a hug on a cold night?

13:07.199 --> 13:10.508
Ideals are useless,
they are like appendix.

13:11.305 --> 13:12.470
Cut 'em out.

13:12.814 --> 13:14.115
He's fast.

13:14.251 --> 13:15.778
He left the old Bill for dust.

13:15.902 --> 13:17.503
I thought maybe we could

13:17.627 --> 13:20.583
train him up, seeing as we have a vacancy.

13:20.707 --> 13:22.039
I'm not a thief.

13:22.605 --> 13:25.252
What, you never stole a Sony
from Tesco's?

13:25.376 --> 13:26.630
I don't need to.

13:26.767 --> 13:28.647
They chuck out enough
if you know where to look.

13:28.674 --> 13:30.432
Oh. Living the dream.

13:30.556 --> 13:32.719
We all have to start somewhere, don't we?

13:32.843 --> 13:35.736
It wasn't so long ago that you
were stealing credit card details.

13:35.860 --> 13:39.455
- It's called phishing.
- It's called surviving.

13:39.611 --> 13:42.563
It's what we do, to survive.

13:43.050 --> 13:44.174
I suppose.

13:44.298 --> 13:47.027
Bravo! You need a place to stay?

13:49.819 --> 13:51.667
No. Thank you.

13:52.059 --> 13:53.396
Cheers for the clothes.

13:53.520 --> 13:54.821
I'll pay you back.

13:59.249 --> 14:01.145
It's a really decent copy.

14:01.733 --> 14:04.304
I've seen the original
tons of times, in the Tate.

14:04.428 --> 14:06.348
No, you haven't.

14:12.070 --> 14:13.298
I'll tell you what,

14:13.422 --> 14:14.664
I'll cook tonight, Dodge.

14:14.788 --> 14:16.797
What do you want?
A spaghetti or a beef burger?

14:16.921 --> 14:19.540
- Oh, I love the spag...
- Oh no, come on, do me a flavour, Fagin.

14:19.606 --> 14:21.419
You know, I'm 72 percent vegan.

14:21.543 --> 14:22.671
Meat is a treat.

14:22.738 --> 14:25.888
Doesn't matter what you eat,
so long as you eat together.

14:26.080 --> 14:28.855
Because, as I've always have said
the most important thing

14:28.979 --> 14:31.365
is the family that eats together

14:31.489 --> 14:33.503
- Stays together.
- Stays together.

14:33.627 --> 14:35.220
Yeah. Right.

14:44.139 --> 14:45.364
Oi!

14:45.488 --> 14:46.638
Mate.

14:47.149 --> 14:48.728
I just wanted to...

14:50.370 --> 14:51.994
Sound of gulping like a fish?

14:52.585 --> 14:55.506
If you could speak sometimes, wouldn't that
be great, cause I got somewhere to go...

14:55.530 --> 14:56.680
I'm sorry.

14:56.836 --> 14:58.000
I didn't realize you were...

14:58.084 --> 14:59.764
And I didn't recognize you
with clothes on.

14:59.885 --> 15:01.495
I just wanted to say thanks.

15:01.619 --> 15:02.792
You're welcome.

15:03.983 --> 15:05.197
Is that everything?

15:06.842 --> 15:08.349
I'll take that as a yes.

15:30.096 --> 15:32.024
Oh. Thanks.

16:37.736 --> 16:39.648
So, what do you see?

16:39.952 --> 16:42.142
A loner with a cracking pair of trainers?

16:43.244 --> 16:46.434
Well, that's disappointing,
you missed a point.

16:48.724 --> 16:51.168
- Can you get up there?
- Please.

16:51.313 --> 16:53.337
If he can... Yeah.

16:53.461 --> 16:55.429
Some boys like respect.

16:56.270 --> 16:59.110
Some boys like being in the
pecking order.

16:59.325 --> 17:00.570
But this one...

17:01.469 --> 17:03.484
He wants something that he's missing.

17:04.119 --> 17:05.714
A smart phone?

17:07.767 --> 17:09.321
He wants love.

17:09.513 --> 17:11.299
So, let's give it to him.

17:51.686 --> 17:53.463
Love what you've done with the place.

17:53.654 --> 17:55.924
Oh it's just while I'm doing
this one, here.

17:58.333 --> 18:00.013
You gonna offer me a cup of tea then or...

18:00.056 --> 18:02.385
I could do you cream crackers
and chocolates bread.

18:02.509 --> 18:04.167
Oh, nutritious.

18:05.835 --> 18:07.747
I thought you were a guy by the way.

18:07.886 --> 18:09.604
That's why I was being weird earlier.

18:09.728 --> 18:11.979
- You say the sweetest things.
- No, no.

18:12.103 --> 18:14.475
I wasn't. I mean...

18:14.836 --> 18:17.087
I just... hoped...
the way you move...

18:17.211 --> 18:19.559
Like a guy? Yeah, I get it.

18:20.169 --> 18:21.198
I don't mean to offend you.

18:21.222 --> 18:22.863
No, why would that offend me?

18:22.987 --> 18:24.843
Just, guys are more strong.

18:25.026 --> 18:26.635
Not that girls aren't strong,

18:26.759 --> 18:28.224
of course they are strong as well,

18:28.348 --> 18:30.122
just, guy tend to be...

18:30.246 --> 18:32.547
Not much of a straight talker, are we?

18:32.923 --> 18:34.724
Bestest climber I think.

18:36.212 --> 18:38.082
How come you are so good
at climbing anyway?

18:41.609 --> 18:42.924
When I was younger,

18:43.048 --> 18:44.825
I was safer up high.

18:45.597 --> 18:46.993
People couldn't find me.

18:49.165 --> 18:51.069
So I taught myself to climb.

18:51.666 --> 18:53.745
And you've been a loner on the roofs
ever since?

18:54.447 --> 18:55.875
Suits me just fine.

18:57.376 --> 18:58.994
You can't stay here forever.

18:59.520 --> 19:02.063
Without the things you wanna see,
things you wanna experience.

19:02.187 --> 19:03.510
It's getting pretty boring.

19:03.634 --> 19:05.585
I can go anywhere I want.

19:06.922 --> 19:08.787
- What?
- See.

19:20.918 --> 19:22.358
I can imagine.

19:22.482 --> 19:25.781
Well, I'm here, in real life.

19:25.905 --> 19:28.568
And I've come to invite
you to a real life dinner.

19:28.692 --> 19:30.270
Me and you?

19:32.085 --> 19:34.735
Come to Fagin's, tonight at seven.

19:35.597 --> 19:36.839
And you never know,

19:36.963 --> 19:39.629
we might just be better company
than your paintings.

19:59.466 --> 20:02.061
EAST LONDON THIEF
TOM CHITLING FOUND DEAD

20:16.799 --> 20:18.290
What does Oliver say?

20:20.683 --> 20:21.960
Mum?

20:25.713 --> 20:27.435
Can't live by yourself forever.

20:32.236 --> 20:33.521
You are late.

20:34.572 --> 20:38.014
Is that any way to greet
your favourite supplier?

20:40.698 --> 20:42.594
What happened to Tom?

20:42.914 --> 20:45.159
He screwed up, that's what happened.

20:45.283 --> 20:48.416
My kids, are not disposable.

20:48.727 --> 20:51.330
That's exactly what they are,
my old friend.

20:51.791 --> 20:54.471
No friends, no family, no questions.

21:02.227 --> 21:03.822
For complications.

21:10.849 --> 21:12.689
Did you get my envelope?

21:13.247 --> 21:14.682
What? This?

21:16.124 --> 21:17.980
When has it ever been that easy, eh?

21:19.724 --> 21:21.014
I want in.

21:21.138 --> 21:22.778
I know you're pulling a job.

21:22.902 --> 21:24.409
You're hitting Losberne.

21:24.767 --> 21:26.370
I want a cut.

21:26.524 --> 21:29.063
- I was gonna tell you.
- Of course you were.

21:29.336 --> 21:31.078
Let me make it easy for you.

21:31.202 --> 21:32.921
Whatever is in there...

21:33.045 --> 21:34.938
seems very important to your little man.

21:35.062 --> 21:37.783
Question is are we gonna do
the easy or the hard way?

21:47.113 --> 21:48.429
Partners?

21:55.335 --> 21:56.834
Partners.

21:57.146 --> 21:58.621
Now,

21:59.481 --> 22:00.888
the envelope.

22:01.739 --> 22:03.516
I think I'll keep it.

22:04.280 --> 22:07.073
Just in case of future complication.

22:24.397 --> 22:25.737
Yeah.

22:26.166 --> 22:29.688
God, what took you a blunt...
oh my giddy aunt!

22:29.812 --> 22:32.207
What is happening with your bun, eh?

22:32.680 --> 22:34.701
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

22:34.889 --> 22:36.044
Come on, look, look.

22:36.168 --> 22:37.303
Welcome, Twist.

22:37.427 --> 22:40.467
Let me take your jeans shirt, jacket

22:40.591 --> 22:42.574
for you. Here we go.

22:43.490 --> 22:44.894
Come on.

22:45.102 --> 22:46.975
Glad you could make it, mate.

22:47.557 --> 22:50.032
Twist, come and sit next to me.

22:52.920 --> 22:54.202
Oh, allow me to...

22:54.326 --> 22:58.082
Nancy, you take these beautiful flowers
and put them in some water.

23:02.320 --> 23:04.073
He can call me that.

23:04.223 --> 23:05.897
- You don't.
- Understood.

23:06.495 --> 23:08.959
I am starving.

23:09.083 --> 23:10.525
Dodge, please.

23:10.649 --> 23:12.289
Fagin, can we just talk about something?

23:12.413 --> 23:13.948
Can we talk about our boy

23:14.072 --> 23:16.611
Batesy, stealing my food
from under my bed.

23:16.909 --> 23:18.701
- Gross.
- Thief.

23:18.825 --> 23:19.891
OK. We're all thieves.

23:20.015 --> 23:21.579
Yeah. Be a better one,
that's the point.

23:21.703 --> 23:23.668
Alright, OK. OK.

23:24.132 --> 23:25.132
Twist,

23:25.219 --> 23:28.774
I want you to say a few words,
because it's a tradition...

23:28.898 --> 23:31.771
about, how thankful you are.

23:32.735 --> 23:33.956
Well...

23:34.158 --> 23:36.316
Thanks for having me around
for dinner, I suppose.

23:36.763 --> 23:39.263
I can't remember the last time
that I sat down.

23:39.404 --> 23:40.948
Like a family?

23:41.878 --> 23:44.234
We are all orphans here.

23:49.501 --> 23:50.651
Alright, that's the thanks.

23:50.775 --> 23:52.740
Great, cool, can we bloody eat now?

23:52.864 --> 23:55.926
Yes! Eat, eat, eat!

23:56.582 --> 23:57.978
Let's go.

24:08.112 --> 24:10.708
It appears that you are
a commissaire of beauty.

24:10.993 --> 24:15.962
Yeah. I saw you in my office
admiring my collection, Mr Twist.

24:16.966 --> 24:18.934
Can I stop using that name?

24:19.159 --> 24:21.618
It makes me sound as I'm in a casino.

24:22.073 --> 24:24.191
What else can I call you?

24:24.472 --> 24:25.645
Oliver.

24:25.798 --> 24:27.694
Oliver, well, Oliver.

24:28.118 --> 24:30.387
Your artwork is impressive.

24:30.534 --> 24:33.517
- They are just copies.
- No. Nothing is just a copy.

24:33.601 --> 24:36.965
We always put a little bit of soul
into everything, don't you think?

24:38.027 --> 24:39.115
Yeah. I suppose.

24:39.239 --> 24:42.622
When I was at your age, I wanted
to be an artist, just like you.

24:43.174 --> 24:45.656
But my father was...
tasteless, a bully.

24:45.780 --> 24:46.864
I'm sorry.

24:46.988 --> 24:50.281
Why sorry? This is all my art
and Nancy...

24:50.729 --> 24:52.498
is my masterpiece.

24:53.154 --> 24:55.301
She needs someone to train with.

24:55.425 --> 24:57.448
Someone who can keep up with her.

24:58.355 --> 24:59.964
So, you just do whatever you want?

25:00.088 --> 25:02.291
Yes, but together.

25:02.415 --> 25:04.238
We never work alone.

25:04.362 --> 25:07.298
We live together, we eat together...

25:07.571 --> 25:09.226
cause the family that eats together...

25:09.350 --> 25:10.569
stays together.

25:10.693 --> 25:12.042
I know.

25:12.826 --> 25:14.869
Alright. What's with all this?

25:15.595 --> 25:17.251
Got a little surprise for you.

25:17.375 --> 25:18.660
- For me?
- Yeah.

25:28.920 --> 25:30.443
Come on, man.

25:30.786 --> 25:32.032
You ready?

25:32.478 --> 25:33.706
We are going out.

25:33.830 --> 25:35.071
Come on.

25:35.389 --> 25:37.738
Make sure you bring him back in one piece.

25:48.480 --> 25:50.368
Don't you guys ever feel bad?

25:50.666 --> 25:51.959
For what?

25:52.183 --> 25:53.183
No.

25:53.248 --> 25:54.736
Look, the people that we target

25:54.860 --> 25:57.112
are criminals anyway, so it's...

25:57.236 --> 25:58.640
justified. Ain't it?

25:58.916 --> 26:00.349
Think of Fagin as...

26:00.473 --> 26:03.068
good old Robin Hood,
and we are his merry men.

26:30.994 --> 26:32.398
Oliver.

26:33.488 --> 26:34.908
Oliver.

26:35.045 --> 26:36.271
Hey, wake up.

26:36.395 --> 26:37.633
Come on.

26:38.462 --> 26:40.842
Get changed, we are going out.

26:42.697 --> 26:44.268
Can you give me a sec?

26:49.699 --> 26:52.981
- So, are you sticking around?
- Yeah, I think I will.

26:53.105 --> 26:54.466
You sure you wanna do this?

26:54.590 --> 26:57.675
Yeah. It's nice to belong to something.

26:57.799 --> 26:59.877
Trust me, you'll be fine.

27:13.112 --> 27:14.591
Good morning, Doctor Losberne.

27:16.797 --> 27:17.947
Good morning.

27:21.809 --> 27:25.078
Doctor Crispin Losberne.

27:26.634 --> 27:28.890
Curator, art dealer,

27:29.078 --> 27:32.361
a connoisseur of 18th century painters.

27:32.485 --> 27:34.990
He is very predictable, which helps.

27:35.114 --> 27:36.984
He gets up every morning.

27:37.108 --> 27:40.335
And leaves for work at 8 o'clock sharp.

27:40.459 --> 27:42.752
He looks at his messages.

27:42.876 --> 27:47.096
And he puts his phone away in
the right hand pocket of his coat.

27:47.220 --> 27:48.215
- Flat white.
- Yes sir.

27:48.239 --> 27:49.902
Pays the barista.

27:50.026 --> 27:51.977
Then he drinks his coffee.

27:52.534 --> 27:53.618
What's all this about?

27:53.742 --> 27:55.826
We're gonna borrow his phone.

27:55.950 --> 27:58.876
And have it back in his pocket
before he know its gone.

27:59.000 --> 28:02.015
- But why?
- He took everything from me.

28:02.392 --> 28:03.986
Everything.

28:04.665 --> 28:07.855
And now I'm going to return the favor.

28:08.211 --> 28:11.898
First thing, we need to
hack Losberne's phone.

28:12.022 --> 28:15.729
Oh, and as far as the day is concerned
it's all performance art

28:15.853 --> 28:19.559
and the performance will be given
by Nancy.

28:22.873 --> 28:25.259
I am such a cunt, let me help.

28:25.383 --> 28:27.784
I've got tissues in my bag,
absolutely must, let me help.

28:27.908 --> 28:30.436
Oh God, it's all over your lovely jacket.

28:30.560 --> 28:31.710
I'm so stupid.

28:36.649 --> 28:39.615
I was just on my way to Royal Academy
to the Gettysburg exhibition.

28:39.739 --> 28:41.532
- Really?
- Oh, you've been?

28:43.980 --> 28:45.929
As a matter of fact, I curate it.

28:46.053 --> 28:47.145
Really?

28:47.269 --> 28:48.320
Oh, yes, come on.

28:48.444 --> 28:50.673
- Dodge, got it yet?
- Yeah, target in.

28:52.027 --> 28:53.185
Alright.

28:55.603 --> 28:57.515
I'm quite a movement shaker
in the art world.

28:57.731 --> 28:58.847
I have my own place.

28:58.971 --> 29:00.708
You have your own gallery?

29:01.142 --> 29:02.511
Is that working, Bates?

29:02.635 --> 29:04.611
You never need interns, do you?

29:04.747 --> 29:06.048
Never say never.

29:07.445 --> 29:10.293
- Come on, Batesy, hurry up.
- I'll give you my card.

29:10.655 --> 29:12.520
I'm going as quick as I can.

29:12.880 --> 29:14.252
It's in my jacket?

29:17.201 --> 29:18.518
We need to speed this up.

29:19.608 --> 29:21.020
Yes, of course.

29:22.969 --> 29:24.158
Got wet.

29:24.343 --> 29:25.870
Hurry up, hurry up.

29:25.994 --> 29:27.588
Pop by anytime.

29:28.779 --> 29:29.779
Bye.

29:29.900 --> 29:31.431
Dodge, quick, he's leaving.

29:35.711 --> 29:37.084
Quickly.

29:37.222 --> 29:38.705
Yes, let's go.

29:45.867 --> 29:47.596
Garages on Swift Road.

29:56.712 --> 29:58.409
Someone's taken my phone.

30:00.063 --> 30:01.324
Oi!

30:05.196 --> 30:06.473
God!

30:12.774 --> 30:16.353
- Get out of my taxi.
- Sorry, mate, I thought it was free.

30:18.326 --> 30:20.032
Is that what you're looking for?

30:21.461 --> 30:23.658
Yes. Thank you.

30:23.947 --> 30:26.208
You can keep the taxi.
I am going to walk.

30:26.649 --> 30:28.148
Cheers.

30:30.922 --> 30:32.398
Where to go?

30:34.732 --> 30:36.474
Yeah, not bad for your first job, Oliver.

30:36.598 --> 30:38.930
Yeah, and that was just your turf.

30:39.385 --> 30:40.710
Batesy.

30:40.966 --> 30:42.243
Keep hacking.

30:42.507 --> 30:45.347
One word from Losberne, I wanna hear it.

30:45.635 --> 30:47.897
We need to know his every move.

30:48.608 --> 30:50.191
- Dodge?
- Yeah.

30:50.315 --> 30:52.181
Do the washing up.

30:52.666 --> 30:54.609
- Oh. Man...
- Nancy?

30:54.795 --> 30:56.420
You are going to art school.

30:56.544 --> 30:57.658
What?

30:57.782 --> 30:59.535
It's a crash course.

30:59.659 --> 31:01.854
If you are gonna be convincing
as an art student

31:01.978 --> 31:03.872
for an evening or even for ten minutes

31:03.996 --> 31:06.749
you're gonna have to know
some art to talk about.

31:06.928 --> 31:09.027
Oliver? Would you mind...

31:09.151 --> 31:10.171
Of course.

31:10.295 --> 31:11.427
Good.

31:11.551 --> 31:13.946
Nothing beats seeing it in the flesh.

31:15.117 --> 31:16.966
This is about Pope Nicholas.

31:17.610 --> 31:18.808
He's fuming.

31:19.818 --> 31:20.853
And Dante is...

31:20.977 --> 31:22.667
- Shit!
- What?

31:25.639 --> 31:27.342
Do you realize this gallery is free, yeah?

31:27.466 --> 31:29.716
He's worked here for years.
He hates me.

31:29.840 --> 31:32.419
He's always thrown me out
for sleeping here.

31:33.191 --> 31:34.259
Get up.

31:34.383 --> 31:35.815
Here, I got you.

31:37.042 --> 31:38.597
He doesn't scare me.

31:41.347 --> 31:43.044
Shall we?

31:52.608 --> 31:54.122
Millais is a genius.

31:55.022 --> 31:55.863
The use of...

31:55.887 --> 31:58.943
Probably gonna win the 500 meter
backstroke, doesn't she?

32:00.078 --> 32:01.902
Joking, I know it's Ophelia.

32:03.048 --> 32:04.762
Anything else you'd like to add?

32:06.399 --> 32:07.922
Well personally,

32:08.194 --> 32:11.628
I think the flowers in the painting
are as important as Ophelia herself.

32:11.964 --> 32:14.949
The floating flowers, they
represent her sorrow and

32:15.164 --> 32:18.449
the nettles growing around willow,
that's the pain.

32:19.460 --> 32:20.650
Exactly.

32:21.349 --> 32:22.814
Did you do art school?

32:22.938 --> 32:25.842
No... just common sense. Ain't it?

32:26.252 --> 32:28.336
Well, that and the internet.

32:28.835 --> 32:31.430
Alright, let's see what else you got.

32:39.977 --> 32:43.572
So, do you feel ready to be the
most convincing art student of all time?

32:43.806 --> 32:45.623
Yeah. Totally.

32:45.903 --> 32:47.965
Well, no thanks to my teacher.
He was rubbish.

32:48.089 --> 32:49.295
Oi!

32:51.232 --> 32:52.620
So...

32:53.451 --> 32:55.365
Couldn't help but notice old Ophelia

32:55.489 --> 32:57.456
made quite an impression on you.

32:57.888 --> 32:59.038
Yeah.

33:00.477 --> 33:02.023
What was it about her?

33:05.505 --> 33:07.758
I used to go to that gallery with my mum.

33:08.619 --> 33:10.936
- She was an artist.
- Right.

33:11.138 --> 33:12.716
That makes sense.

33:13.887 --> 33:16.640
- So, you did have a family?
- Just a mum.

33:17.430 --> 33:19.533
She wasn't around for too long.

33:20.746 --> 33:21.936
Did you?

33:22.447 --> 33:23.756
Just a dad.

33:24.100 --> 33:25.750
He was around for too long.

33:28.795 --> 33:30.881
So why did you get into
free running then?

33:31.939 --> 33:33.351
So, I could escape.

33:34.011 --> 33:35.503
Escape from what?

33:37.685 --> 33:40.056
From boys but Oliver Twist.

33:45.229 --> 33:46.530
Come here.

33:48.130 --> 33:52.161
To pull this job off, we'll need the plans
for Losberne's gallery.

33:53.743 --> 33:55.720
Oh, not the cap and the Tash.

33:55.844 --> 33:57.394
- Hello.
- Good morning, sir.

33:57.518 --> 33:59.079
We spoke on the telephone

33:59.203 --> 34:01.922
about your conversion of number thirty.

34:02.046 --> 34:03.376
The Losberne gallery.

34:03.500 --> 34:05.980
I have bought a building up aside.

34:06.104 --> 34:10.032
And I want you to make it modern
like number thirty.

34:10.156 --> 34:13.226
Yes, I have the plans here. I can
show you what we did for Dr Losberne.

34:13.351 --> 34:14.777
Follow me.

34:16.909 --> 34:18.190
Yes.

34:18.313 --> 34:20.614
Very nice, very nice.

34:23.170 --> 34:24.318
Da?

34:24.442 --> 34:26.953
11:05 on the dock, Fagin.

34:27.077 --> 34:28.976
Just like you said.

34:29.333 --> 34:30.733
Where is the nearest train station?

34:30.844 --> 34:32.387
I've lost my wallet!

34:32.523 --> 34:34.409
How much does this sandwich cost?

34:34.533 --> 34:37.686
What time do you serve breakfast until?
- What?

34:40.041 --> 34:41.714
This is David.

34:41.838 --> 34:44.393
It's OK. I don't understand Russian. So...

34:45.610 --> 34:47.610
You want my business?

34:48.050 --> 34:50.380
Certainly not. Take your time.

34:50.504 --> 34:52.463
Thank you.

35:02.206 --> 35:05.530
No windows, reinforced walls.

35:06.546 --> 35:07.799
That's the one.

35:08.120 --> 35:10.016
That'll be a job getting in.

35:10.184 --> 35:11.692
We don't have to do that.

35:12.862 --> 35:15.068
If we do what I've got planned,

35:15.586 --> 35:16.990
they bring it out.

35:17.120 --> 35:18.640
Batesy, carry on.

35:18.764 --> 35:20.137
Bring what out?

35:20.465 --> 35:23.796
This is the painting we're gonna steal.

35:23.920 --> 35:25.440
One of six paintings,

35:25.564 --> 35:27.131
by William Hogarth.

35:27.255 --> 35:29.624
That says Dotheboys auction house, Fagin.

35:29.748 --> 35:31.141
Why are we casing out Losberne?

35:31.265 --> 35:33.267
While the painting
was lost in a fire

35:33.391 --> 35:36.334
many people believed it
was a cover up for a theft.

35:36.458 --> 35:39.134
All this time it's been off the radar.

35:39.258 --> 35:42.271
So you're saying Losbern's got it.

35:42.395 --> 35:44.159
- He is the seller.
- Wait. Hang on, a bit.

35:44.266 --> 35:45.519
How did he get his hands on it?

35:45.594 --> 35:48.622
Many years ago, Losberne
went into partnership

35:48.746 --> 35:50.955
with a man called Isaac Solomon.

35:51.079 --> 35:54.022
Both of them, bought a lot
of paintings, one of them...

35:54.401 --> 35:55.773
was the Hogarth.

35:56.022 --> 35:57.608
But when they had an auction...

35:57.732 --> 35:59.882
Losberne went missing...

36:00.083 --> 36:01.614
with the paintings.

36:02.329 --> 36:07.185
And Solomon had nothing and his credibility
as an art dealer was gone.

36:07.467 --> 36:11.019
Later, Losberne said
the paintings have been stolen.

36:11.143 --> 36:12.833
Solomon tells me.

36:13.721 --> 36:16.011
How long have you been here?
I didn't know you're coming.

36:16.135 --> 36:19.459
You should be more careful, Fagin,
you're getting sloppy in your old age.

36:23.011 --> 36:24.850
It's only you two.

36:25.146 --> 36:28.296
Oliver, there is someone
I'd like you to meet.

36:29.786 --> 36:31.150
Oliver.

36:33.256 --> 36:34.565
Here boy.

36:35.092 --> 36:36.416
This is Bulls-eye.

36:38.325 --> 36:40.015
You're gonna need your hands later.

36:42.225 --> 36:43.494
Round two.

36:46.376 --> 36:48.113
Magnetic, see?

36:48.891 --> 36:50.876
Stick it on a pipe and get out.

37:00.347 --> 37:03.147
Oh, so sorry, is it a bad time?

37:03.905 --> 37:05.317
It's the perfect time.

37:15.358 --> 37:16.828
Thank you.

37:18.172 --> 37:20.219
- Bottoms up.
- Oh.

37:21.151 --> 37:22.714
Cheers.

37:28.304 --> 37:30.354
So, you were saying I'd
be answering the phones,

37:30.478 --> 37:31.950
staying late for the filing.

37:32.240 --> 37:34.446
Nothing a girl like you couldn't handle.

37:35.121 --> 37:38.112
I did actually want to show you
some of my art.

37:38.433 --> 37:41.774
- Street art, you say?
- Yes. Just on it.

37:45.571 --> 37:49.435
Let me just find them, yes. OK.

37:50.018 --> 37:52.379
- This one is actually based on...
- William Blake.

37:52.503 --> 37:54.066
Of course.

37:55.346 --> 37:57.790
I love what you've
done with the line there.

37:58.582 --> 38:02.708
- These are actually rather intriguing.
- Don't gas me.

38:03.526 --> 38:05.943
- Come on girl.
- Give her a second.

38:06.067 --> 38:08.107
Sorry that's my, graffiti talk,

38:08.231 --> 38:10.722
it's the only way to get
taken seriously on the street.

38:11.688 --> 38:13.076
Alright.

38:14.150 --> 38:15.569
Don't forget your wine.

38:15.737 --> 38:19.326
It's just going straight through me.
I must pop to little girls room.

38:25.493 --> 38:27.556
Is it downstairs or...

38:28.002 --> 38:30.700
Straight down the stairs,
door right in front of you.

38:32.578 --> 38:33.728
Okay.

38:50.536 --> 38:53.233
Oh no, he's on the move.

38:57.616 --> 38:59.058
Fuck.

39:01.549 --> 39:04.023
- It blew my hand off.
- Calm down.

39:04.147 --> 39:06.738
- Everything alright?
- Yes. I will be up in a minute.

39:06.862 --> 39:08.438
You better have brought a spare.

39:08.562 --> 39:10.037
Alright.

39:13.295 --> 39:15.857
- We just gotta get it to her.
- I'll take it.

39:16.845 --> 39:17.935
I'm the climber, right?

39:18.059 --> 39:20.574
Whatever you do, don't drop it.

39:52.586 --> 39:54.783
Red, it's me. Let me in.

39:56.103 --> 39:57.348
Oliver.

40:01.200 --> 40:02.533
Oh my God.

40:07.316 --> 40:08.816
What's going on down there?

40:19.194 --> 40:20.357
Losberne gallery.

40:20.481 --> 40:21.509
Special delivery.

40:21.633 --> 40:22.989
At this time of night?

40:23.113 --> 40:25.739
I'm right outside, mate,
got a large package says

40:26.026 --> 40:27.549
ARTWORK'S FRAGILE.

40:27.673 --> 40:29.915
I could leave it on the
doorstep if you want.

40:30.039 --> 40:31.845
No, no, no. I'm coming.

40:31.969 --> 40:34.976
I was just a little busy. One second.

40:35.178 --> 40:37.558
I'm at the window, where are you?

40:37.682 --> 40:39.721
Let me just check on that.

40:40.001 --> 40:42.262
Sorry mate, wrong number.

40:52.061 --> 40:53.597
I wouldn't use that lav...

40:53.721 --> 40:55.967
Bathroom for a bit.

40:56.802 --> 40:59.381
I'm sorry, you're going to
have to wait here for a moment.

40:59.505 --> 41:00.794
Brittles?

41:00.918 --> 41:02.537
Can you come up here, please?

41:10.348 --> 41:11.807
What is this?

41:16.128 --> 41:17.524
Search her bag.

41:17.924 --> 41:19.431
Hey!

41:20.076 --> 41:21.536
Excuse me.

41:26.146 --> 41:27.916
If that's the way you
treat all your interns,

41:27.991 --> 41:30.590
you can take your work experience
and shove it up your ass.

42:17.059 --> 42:20.373
Our Dr Losberne is gonna
get a surprise in the morning.

42:20.497 --> 42:22.390
Until then, you can take the night off.

42:22.514 --> 42:24.845
Go out, have some fun.

42:24.969 --> 42:28.333
Yeah, but wait a minute, not too much fun
because you're back on duty

42:28.457 --> 42:30.439
- at 7 AM.
- At Seven?

42:30.563 --> 42:32.179
Yeah. We all gotta be ready

42:32.303 --> 42:34.117
to move when they phone calls.

42:34.241 --> 42:36.078
And I'll stay tuned to Losberne.

42:36.202 --> 42:38.975
Well, you know, he might
be into some heavy phone sex

42:39.099 --> 42:41.938
which means you might be
up for a steamy night, oh boy.

42:42.062 --> 42:44.001
So, there is this party, what do you say?

42:44.125 --> 42:47.672
- Red? You coming?
- She got plans.

43:05.395 --> 43:07.458
Mate, let's go. Come on.

43:07.921 --> 43:09.071
Awkward.

43:23.676 --> 43:27.596
Come on mate, don't be such...
don't be dying on love.

43:27.741 --> 43:29.621
There are other birds in London.

43:30.164 --> 43:31.563
Come on, have a drink with us.

43:31.687 --> 43:32.937
No, I'm alright, mate.

43:33.061 --> 43:34.385
On your soul.

43:34.826 --> 43:37.864
- No, you want to...
- Seriously, Batesy.

43:38.018 --> 43:39.628
I'm alright here.

43:39.956 --> 43:41.677
Alright. Alright.

43:50.253 --> 43:52.117
- Hey.
- I said I'm...

43:53.103 --> 43:54.179
Oi!

43:54.303 --> 43:55.779
You mug.

43:56.543 --> 43:58.074
She belongs to Sikes.

43:58.517 --> 43:59.727
You think I don't know that?

43:59.851 --> 44:01.707
I don't belong to anyone.

44:09.000 --> 44:10.440
We'll see.

44:38.881 --> 44:40.794
Batesy, look out!

44:51.189 --> 44:52.775
I love coming here.

44:53.436 --> 44:55.386
You almost forget you're in the city.

44:55.936 --> 44:57.570
How'd you know about this place?

44:58.996 --> 45:00.685
Sikes brought me here once.

45:02.410 --> 45:04.203
Why'd you bring me here then?

45:05.183 --> 45:08.349
Because I wanted to. Is that OK?

45:30.320 --> 45:31.985
Seriously, why did you bring me here?

45:32.314 --> 45:33.972
Why wouldn't I bring you here?

45:34.157 --> 45:36.773
I don't think your girlfriend
would be too happy if she knew.

45:36.897 --> 45:38.857
I never said she was my girlfriend.

45:39.557 --> 45:41.255
Why didn't you tell me?

45:41.527 --> 45:43.065
Tell you what?

45:44.299 --> 45:46.750
- That you are only into...
- Girls?

45:47.173 --> 45:48.990
Never said that either.

45:51.218 --> 45:52.804

you don't need to be scared.

Call the police, luv. Call police.

46:50.243 --> 46:51.717
I won't, cause
you're assaulting him.

46:51.741 --> 46:52.771
- I'm assaulting him?
- Yeah.

46:52.795 --> 46:56.376
This little bellend has been
vandalising property of the counsel

46:56.500 --> 46:58.470
with his shitty little paintings.

46:58.584 --> 47:00.429
You wanna go as well? You want some?

47:00.553 --> 47:01.553
Come on.

47:01.603 --> 47:04.201
Hold in there.
Get down there you. Go on.

47:04.341 --> 47:05.983
There is the little
bellend there.

47:06.093 --> 47:06.893
That's the one.

47:06.917 --> 47:08.947
- Stay with them, it will be okay.
- Come on, son.

47:09.291 --> 47:11.489
- I'll get Fagin, go on.
- Thank you. Alright.

47:20.077 --> 47:22.147
You know, personally I
think it's an improvement.

47:23.332 --> 47:24.530
So let me go.

47:25.435 --> 47:26.815
Yeah, unfortunately,

47:26.960 --> 47:30.336
Metropolis Parking Solutions, that's the
company whose property you vandalised,

47:30.460 --> 47:32.945
they don't quite share the same views.

47:38.841 --> 47:40.578
Little Ollie Twister.

47:46.089 --> 47:49.533
Look, to be honest, Oliver,
a little bit of graffiti is not really

47:49.902 --> 47:51.290
what concerns me.

47:51.414 --> 47:54.522
You kinda run into Ward and Bumble,
well that's just the kind of foot

47:54.585 --> 47:56.993
it is to miss like,
a happy accident.

47:57.505 --> 47:59.686
What we really wanna
talk to you about is...

48:03.541 --> 48:04.691
this man.

48:06.067 --> 48:07.257
Fagin.

48:07.959 --> 48:09.974
An alias obviously.

48:10.121 --> 48:12.348
Once, prestigious art dealer,

48:12.472 --> 48:13.971
then out of blue

48:14.275 --> 48:16.353
vanishes, disappears.

48:16.903 --> 48:18.092
Since then,

48:18.216 --> 48:22.224
it seems like he's been putting his
knowledge of art to more practical usage.

48:22.483 --> 48:25.172
Apparently he's running
quite the operation.

48:27.361 --> 48:28.638
Here.

48:29.869 --> 48:31.588
And what about this lovely lady?

48:31.712 --> 48:34.655
Known associate of Fagin, Sikes.

48:35.931 --> 48:37.890
How am I supposed to know these two?

48:42.660 --> 48:45.008
Nancy Lee. Alias Red.

48:45.242 --> 48:48.130
Known associate of both Sikes and Fagin's.

48:51.540 --> 48:53.534
That's a pretty girl, Oliver.

48:59.230 --> 49:01.119
I can get you out of this, you know.

49:01.836 --> 49:02.896
Get me out of what?

49:03.020 --> 49:04.390
Ah, see now that,

49:04.514 --> 49:06.554
that's exactly what I'm hoping
you're gonna tell me.

49:06.651 --> 49:09.757
Cause your little friends, your little
new pals, they are not all that they...

49:09.881 --> 49:11.176
seem.

49:11.487 --> 49:12.580
And to be perfectly honest,

49:12.704 --> 49:15.566
friends of Fagin and Sikes
have a nasty habit of ending up...

49:19.270 --> 49:20.738
like that.

49:20.993 --> 49:23.215
Tom Chitling, he died last month.

49:23.450 --> 49:25.129
Take a good look, Oliver.

49:25.253 --> 49:26.768
I don't even know this Sikes.

49:28.224 --> 49:29.429
Are you sure?

49:30.758 --> 49:31.955
I'm sure.

49:34.213 --> 49:35.475
OK.

49:35.812 --> 49:38.191
Well. You are free to go.

49:39.331 --> 49:42.458
Just be careful who you trust cause
people only see what they wanna see.

49:44.505 --> 49:45.940
Off you go then.

49:54.911 --> 49:56.093
You are late.

49:57.492 --> 49:58.793
Where's Twist?

50:00.139 --> 50:01.638
He's with you. Right, Dodge?

50:06.392 --> 50:07.769
Just wanted to get a running.

50:07.893 --> 50:09.202
It distracted time.

50:09.720 --> 50:11.085
I don't know where Twist is.

50:11.532 --> 50:13.075
Okay, we mow the night off.

50:13.199 --> 50:15.603
Those paintings are going nowhere
till the morning.

50:15.838 --> 50:17.606
It is morning, where is he?

50:31.383 --> 50:32.396
Who is this?

50:32.520 --> 50:34.701
Think of me as the friendly
uncle you never had.

50:35.165 --> 50:37.371
I just wanted to make sure
you have got my number.

50:37.802 --> 50:40.370
In case you remember
anything about Miss Sikes.

50:40.494 --> 50:41.795
I won't.

50:42.663 --> 50:45.020
You got some explaining to do, boy.

50:46.278 --> 50:47.450
Where have you been, then?

50:47.574 --> 50:49.732
I went to a pub with Dodge and Batesy.

50:49.917 --> 50:52.242
They got back here hours ago.
What happened to you?

50:52.619 --> 50:54.095
I got arrested.

50:54.654 --> 50:55.884
We never linked words, are we?

50:55.940 --> 50:57.466
No, it wasn't like that.

50:57.590 --> 50:58.980
There was this traffic warden.

50:59.016 --> 51:00.722
I rode on his van, and
he wasn’t happy about it.

51:00.746 --> 51:02.893
- You rode on his van last night?
- No.

51:03.017 --> 51:04.167
Last week.

51:04.612 --> 51:06.271
I bumped into him this
morning when I was...

51:06.295 --> 51:08.127
How come the cops let you go?

51:08.793 --> 51:11.108
- Did you give them something they wanted?
- No. Nothing.

51:11.232 --> 51:12.267
I gave them nothing.

51:12.391 --> 51:13.608
If he gossed why would he come back here?

51:13.632 --> 51:14.692
Was I talking to you?

51:14.780 --> 51:16.192
- I'm just saying...
- Don't.

51:17.039 --> 51:17.983
We need him.

51:18.007 --> 51:20.181
<i>- Hello, Art Net.
- Hello. It's Dr. Christopher Losberne.</i>

51:20.205 --> 51:22.900
<i>My vault is flooded so I need
to move the paintings to Dotheboys.</i>

51:23.024 --> 51:24.566
He's on the phone with the couriers.

51:24.690 --> 51:26.297
They are arranging a pick up.

51:28.584 --> 51:30.223
Round three.

51:31.248 --> 51:33.482
The paintings are gonna be on the move.

51:33.606 --> 51:34.803
This is it.

51:34.997 --> 51:37.393
You better pray this time
it goes like clockwork.

51:39.848 --> 51:40.998
Remember.

51:41.582 --> 51:43.042
I'm watching.

51:50.941 --> 51:52.944
I'm claustrophobic, OK?

51:53.068 --> 51:55.845
Nobody told me that it was gonna be
that small.

51:56.080 --> 51:57.307
Quit making a fuss and get in.

51:57.431 --> 51:59.737
I'm not making a fuss.
I'm claustrophobic.

51:59.861 --> 52:01.423
It's an actual condition.

52:02.181 --> 52:03.573
If Batesy gets in
there and passes out

52:03.597 --> 52:05.037
or something, the
whole plan's screwed.

52:05.061 --> 52:06.518
- What are we gonna do?
- Exactly, exactly.

52:06.542 --> 52:09.748
And there is every chance,
if I get in there I will pass out.

52:09.872 --> 52:11.853
Batesy, don't be such a baby.

52:11.977 --> 52:13.736
So, what are you gonna do?
Force him down?

52:13.860 --> 52:15.929
You say you gotta do something,
you just don't do it.

52:15.953 --> 52:18.701
Are we gonna do this or are you
gonna stand there arguing all day?

52:18.825 --> 52:20.103
What was in that?

52:21.264 --> 52:22.446
Alright.

52:22.837 --> 52:26.979
Anybody tries to move the crate,
you set off the smoke bomb in their face.

52:28.009 --> 52:29.405
Piece of cake.

52:30.160 --> 52:31.644
Alright, that's it.

52:33.538 --> 52:34.744
Let's do it then.

52:37.860 --> 52:39.010
Really?

52:50.890 --> 52:52.980
Delivery to a gallery W1, yeah?

52:53.104 --> 52:55.264
Yeah, coming up, darling.
Just got a few top off first.

52:55.347 --> 52:56.563
Alright, cheers lad.

53:20.646 --> 53:23.246
There weren't any sharing trouble
with the national gallery cases?

53:23.305 --> 53:24.732
Yeah, let me see.

53:24.856 --> 53:27.932
Originally yours is dropped off first
and then also national gallery.

53:28.056 --> 53:30.952
It's just an extra pick up, mate.
It won't affect you, this one.

53:33.305 --> 53:34.947
Chiswell Fine arts.

53:36.096 --> 53:37.946
I've never heard of it.

53:43.972 --> 53:47.775
Have you ever heard of a
Chiswell Fine Arts somewhere near here?

53:48.025 --> 53:50.207
I thought you knew all
the galleries in London.

53:53.147 --> 53:54.519
I'll Google it.

54:01.365 --> 54:03.340
Can't find a Chiswell.

54:06.022 --> 54:08.170
Get me Art Net on the phone now.

54:28.885 --> 54:30.686
What's all of this?

54:37.326 --> 54:39.925
You out there, darling, what's the hold up.
Can we get through or what?

54:39.949 --> 54:41.627
- How are you doing there, lads?
- Yeah, fine.

54:41.651 --> 54:43.218
- Where are you from?
- I'm from Fulham.

54:43.342 --> 54:46.603
Fulham? I've got some cousins
in Fulham. Do you know Phil?

54:46.727 --> 54:48.255
- No.
- You must know my second cousin.

54:48.379 --> 54:50.194
- What's her name? Oh, Tracy.
- No.

54:50.318 --> 54:51.420
Can we get through?

54:51.544 --> 54:53.749
Can you get through? I mean...
I don't know.

54:54.412 --> 54:57.294
<i>7-4 receiving, 7-4 receiving.</i>

54:58.741 --> 54:59.992
7-4 go ahead.

55:00.116 --> 55:02.446
Yeah, we just got a call
from a Losberne gallery.

55:02.570 --> 55:04.564
<i>They seem to think that
we're being mobbed.</i>

55:07.543 --> 55:09.249
Ah... everything alright, lads?

55:10.172 --> 55:11.449
Floor it!

55:15.717 --> 55:16.880
No!

55:25.642 --> 55:26.792
No!

55:29.078 --> 55:31.138
Sikes, no, Sikes!

55:31.718 --> 55:33.035
Please, Sikes.

55:36.431 --> 55:37.581
Run!

55:38.131 --> 55:39.285
Where is it? Give it to me.

55:39.409 --> 55:41.026
I didn't get it. I'm sorry.

55:41.150 --> 55:42.511
We need a distraction.

55:42.635 --> 55:44.412
Move. Move!

55:49.714 --> 55:51.536
That means don't go this way...

55:51.660 --> 55:52.849
Hey!

55:52.973 --> 55:55.066
Team, the suspect heading
West town cross road.

55:55.253 --> 55:57.339
<i>Officers are in pursuit,
officers are in pursuit.</i>

56:10.022 --> 56:12.284
I thought it might me very nice
for you to stop.

56:16.065 --> 56:17.231
Really?

56:29.758 --> 56:30.947
<i>Unit 7.</i>

56:31.321 --> 56:32.471
<i>Come in.</i>

56:33.309 --> 56:35.809
<i>Unit 7, anybody?</i>

56:41.295 --> 56:43.544
I really need to start cardio.

57:00.431 --> 57:03.303
Yo partner, we got some good news
and some bad news.

57:03.568 --> 57:05.128
Yeah, the bad news is
I haven't got her.

57:05.236 --> 57:06.509
<i>What's the good news?</i>

57:06.633 --> 57:08.418
There is no good news, really.
If I'm honest.

57:08.477 --> 57:10.620
<i>Get yourself back here now.</i>

57:17.677 --> 57:19.058
Oi. Get in.

57:19.417 --> 57:21.001
I need to work on my cardio.

57:21.125 --> 57:24.185
How come Twist was in the back of that van,
it should have been you.

57:24.470 --> 57:26.160
Well, I'm claustrophobic.

57:26.424 --> 57:28.122
So we switched places.

57:30.235 --> 57:31.590
You shouldn't have.

57:38.703 --> 57:40.011
Batesy!

58:08.937 --> 58:11.177
LOOK WHAT YOUR FRIEND SIKES DID.

58:15.418 --> 58:17.097
He should have been back by now.

58:17.221 --> 58:19.053
Quite. I'm trying to think.

58:19.762 --> 58:21.412
That was our one shot.

58:23.543 --> 58:25.074
It's bad luck is all.

58:25.847 --> 58:29.767
Bad luck? There is no such thing, it
was a simple plan, until that bloody Twist

58:29.962 --> 58:31.811
decided to go onto Van.

58:38.302 --> 58:39.432
Mate.

58:39.556 --> 58:41.103
Have you seen?

58:42.418 --> 58:44.195
What happened to Tom Chitling?

58:44.619 --> 58:45.800
He fell.

58:46.741 --> 58:48.531
- Did you see it?
- Someone...

58:48.655 --> 58:50.191
has been misinforming you, Oliver.

58:50.315 --> 58:51.751
Don't avoid the question.

58:51.875 --> 58:55.152
I just don't think it's you
asking the questions.

58:55.639 --> 58:57.400
Who you've been talking to?

59:00.094 --> 59:01.538
Sikes?

59:02.128 --> 59:03.913
Why don't you ask her?

59:05.950 --> 59:07.052
He's a rat.

59:07.556 --> 59:09.578
Van's suddenly peels off.
They knew what was going down.

59:09.602 --> 59:11.580
- I didn't tell them anything.
- Lie!

59:13.114 --> 59:14.432
What's this, eh?

59:17.948 --> 59:21.076
The thing I need to know, Twist
is how you hold up into beating.

59:21.359 --> 59:22.510
How you fall to pieces, eh.

59:22.634 --> 59:24.259
Fagin, make it stop.

59:32.319 --> 59:34.207
Question is do you want some more?

59:36.736 --> 59:37.886
Hold him.

59:39.230 --> 59:41.424
Sikes, don't make it permanent.

59:41.548 --> 59:43.262
Right, Bull's-eye. On my command.

59:44.710 --> 59:46.217
You are making a mistake.

59:47.117 --> 59:48.331
A mistake?

59:49.414 --> 59:51.180
He got in trouble with the traffic warden.

59:51.304 --> 59:53.001
And how would you know that Red?

59:53.846 --> 59:55.155
Cause I was there.

59:56.127 --> 59:57.277
What?

59:59.671 --> 01:00:00.983
We were on our way home.

01:00:01.107 --> 01:00:02.677
And the traffic warden just
came out of nowhere

01:00:02.701 --> 01:00:03.910
and tucked him to the
ground just like he said.

01:00:03.934 --> 01:00:05.369
On your way out from where?

01:00:07.303 --> 01:00:08.732
Oh my God.

01:00:10.198 --> 01:00:11.674
We went for a swim together.

01:00:24.849 --> 01:00:26.158
If he moves, shoot him.

01:00:27.051 --> 01:00:28.335
Come with me!

01:00:28.710 --> 01:00:30.424
Bull's-eye, stay.

01:00:43.037 --> 01:00:44.360
This ain't like Batesy.

01:00:44.484 --> 01:00:46.671
He gets with jaw symptoms
if he ain't plugged in.

01:00:46.795 --> 01:00:47.886
Batesy's dead.

01:00:48.010 --> 01:00:49.010
What?

01:00:49.057 --> 01:00:50.633
Just like she killed Tom.

01:00:50.757 --> 01:00:53.010
- But Sikes said...
- Tom was murdered.

01:00:53.784 --> 01:00:55.831
He didn't go off that roof by accident.

01:00:57.240 --> 01:00:58.977
How would you know that?

01:00:59.449 --> 01:01:01.369
I've got text off that phone.

01:01:02.396 --> 01:01:04.219
Some cop gave it to me
to see if I turn.

01:01:04.343 --> 01:01:05.857
And did you turn?

01:01:05.981 --> 01:01:09.190
Or were you never
with this family to begin with?

01:01:09.314 --> 01:01:11.321
You call this a family?

01:01:11.570 --> 01:01:14.648
When that psycho is out there with Red
and you are pointing a gun at me?

01:01:15.622 --> 01:01:18.507
I don't believe you, I'm gonna
go find Batesy myself.

01:01:18.631 --> 01:01:20.572
You're gonna be looking six feet under.

01:01:20.696 --> 01:01:21.696
He's right.

01:01:21.722 --> 01:01:23.221
I pushed Tom.

01:01:23.406 --> 01:01:25.388
- You lying...
- Please.

01:01:25.512 --> 01:01:27.389
Give me an excuse to kill you.

01:01:27.513 --> 01:01:28.962
You can't kill all of us.

01:01:29.086 --> 01:01:30.728
Let's see. Shall we?

01:01:31.382 --> 01:01:33.754
Six bullets, 3 kids, you do the math.

01:01:34.003 --> 01:01:35.907
We're hitting Dotheboys.
We're getting that painting.

01:01:35.931 --> 01:01:38.681
Dotheboys? I think the whole plan
was to get the painting

01:01:38.805 --> 01:01:40.224
before it went there.

01:01:40.490 --> 01:01:42.385
That place is impenetrable.

01:01:42.642 --> 01:01:44.197
You scared, old man?

01:01:44.788 --> 01:01:47.073
I'll have a plan in four hours.

01:01:47.759 --> 01:01:49.438
Try not to kill any more of them

01:01:49.562 --> 01:01:51.259
in the meantime.

01:01:53.055 --> 01:01:54.856
I can't promise anything.

01:02:02.907 --> 01:02:04.253
Look, mate...

01:02:04.377 --> 01:02:05.733
I believe you.

01:02:05.895 --> 01:02:08.243
What Sikes did to Tom,
that's messed up.

01:02:09.173 --> 01:02:11.538
If we don't do this
we'll lose Red too.

01:02:12.343 --> 01:02:13.818
Sikes is a loose canon.

01:02:14.428 --> 01:02:16.253
Let's just suck up
and be over, yeah?

01:02:17.867 --> 01:02:19.174
Let's do this.

01:02:26.128 --> 01:02:28.413
- Is he on time?
- Like clockwork.

01:02:28.711 --> 01:02:29.996
We're on.

01:02:44.983 --> 01:02:46.692
Oh, hi there, mate, sorry to interrupt.

01:02:46.816 --> 01:02:49.260
- Can I get a bakewell tart please?
- Sure.

01:02:50.331 --> 01:02:52.121
- It's cheap, ain't it?
- Yeah nice, like you said.

01:02:52.145 --> 01:02:53.827
There you go, one fifty.

01:02:54.712 --> 01:02:56.434
There you go, keep the change.

01:02:59.360 --> 01:03:01.612
Thank you, have a good day lads.

01:03:01.736 --> 01:03:02.886
See ya.

01:03:17.021 --> 01:03:19.400
The painting will be under lock and key

01:03:19.524 --> 01:03:21.030
before the auction.

01:03:21.154 --> 01:03:23.891
So, our only chance is
during the main event.

01:03:24.015 --> 01:03:26.727
We go in, like a fan
and in the right moment

01:03:26.851 --> 01:03:29.982
execute the plan sending
the painting your way.

01:03:30.106 --> 01:03:32.478
Let's play happy families, eh? Big smiles.

01:03:49.563 --> 01:03:50.872
Thank you.

01:03:53.212 --> 01:03:54.518
It's the chair.

01:03:54.642 --> 01:03:55.792
Really?

01:04:15.641 --> 01:04:18.162
Dodge, once you are inside, let Twist in.

01:04:18.286 --> 01:04:20.251
Then when all hell is broken loose

01:04:20.375 --> 01:04:21.802
you know what to do.

01:04:26.855 --> 01:04:28.270
I think all are here.

01:04:36.893 --> 01:04:38.424
Don't do anything stupid.

01:04:47.252 --> 01:04:50.355
I'm glad you're finally taking this threat
seriously, officer.

01:04:51.778 --> 01:04:53.891
Detective inspector.

01:04:59.725 --> 01:05:01.534
How many men have you deployed?

01:05:02.236 --> 01:05:04.425
Twelve inside the building.

01:05:04.699 --> 01:05:06.499
Another twenty outside.

01:05:09.948 --> 01:05:11.642
Nobody's getting this painting, Losberne.

01:05:11.766 --> 01:05:13.614
Dr Losberne.

01:05:22.968 --> 01:05:25.157
Better you than me, mate.

01:05:40.924 --> 01:05:42.946
Lot 1-4-6.

01:05:43.245 --> 01:05:45.063
William Hogarth's painting.

01:05:45.187 --> 01:05:47.708
'A Harlot's Progress', 'The Arrest'.

01:05:47.832 --> 01:05:50.474
Oil on canvas, 1731.

01:05:50.727 --> 01:05:52.761
Has resurfaced after many years

01:05:52.885 --> 01:05:55.723
as the only surviving
Harlot's Progress from the fire...

01:05:55.847 --> 01:05:57.417
- Now.
- Of 1775.

01:05:57.802 --> 01:05:59.721
<i>Starts at first buy...</i>

01:05:59.845 --> 01:06:01.524
of three million pounds.

01:06:01.648 --> 01:06:02.846
Yes, ma'am.

01:06:04.901 --> 01:06:07.058
And you sir? From the back there, sir, yes.

01:06:07.182 --> 01:06:08.534
Three million two...

01:06:08.658 --> 01:06:11.712
I have three million
two hundred thousand...

01:06:12.209 --> 01:06:13.478
He's got a gun.

01:06:15.585 --> 01:06:16.585
Stay calm!

01:06:16.619 --> 01:06:17.603
It's a trap!

01:06:17.627 --> 01:06:19.267
The painting. They are after my painting!

01:06:19.304 --> 01:06:22.414
Put it back in the vault.
It will be safe. Safest thing.

01:06:27.573 --> 01:06:29.540
- Open it.
- The door.

01:06:35.962 --> 01:06:37.230
You go with the painting.

01:06:38.056 --> 01:06:39.225
Let's go. Let's go.

01:06:43.155 --> 01:06:44.468
Wait, wait, wait.

01:06:44.592 --> 01:06:45.968
I'm coming with you.

01:06:46.092 --> 01:06:47.731
No one gets down with us.

01:06:47.855 --> 01:06:49.359
There is a robbery in progress.

01:06:49.483 --> 01:06:50.908
Yes, we have our procedures.

01:06:51.032 --> 01:06:53.153
And I have my orders,
and that painting

01:06:53.277 --> 01:06:55.096
ain't going anywhere without me.

01:06:55.220 --> 01:06:56.819
What's... what's going on?

01:06:56.943 --> 01:06:59.535
- Who are you?
- Officer Dockins, sergeant.

01:06:59.659 --> 01:07:01.698
- Dockins?
- Yeah.

01:07:43.575 --> 01:07:46.258
OK. You guys go that way,
you guys come with me. Let's go.

01:07:52.307 --> 01:07:53.766
You!

01:07:54.116 --> 01:07:55.353
Yes.

01:07:55.611 --> 01:07:56.761
It's me.

01:07:58.837 --> 01:08:00.232
That felt good.

01:08:15.727 --> 01:08:17.782
Good. This is good. This is very good.

01:08:18.929 --> 01:08:20.404
Whoa, whoa!

01:08:24.069 --> 01:08:25.537
Show me the painting.

01:08:26.643 --> 01:08:27.975
Ah!

01:08:29.694 --> 01:08:31.599
I'll be honest, it's not his best work.

01:08:41.256 --> 01:08:43.068
Ah you silly...

01:08:43.192 --> 01:08:45.587
You're going no where, son.

01:08:46.546 --> 01:08:47.799
Shit.

01:08:49.808 --> 01:08:53.442
Brownlow, you are wrong about Twist,
he's in the lift shaft.

01:08:53.576 --> 01:08:55.389
Yeah, the dirty swine.

01:08:56.576 --> 01:08:57.964
Well, move then!

01:09:02.071 --> 01:09:03.886
I'm coming for you, Twist.

01:09:04.421 --> 01:09:05.089
Oh no!

01:09:05.113 --> 01:09:07.416
Do you think the lift gonna stop me?

01:09:07.857 --> 01:09:10.136
- You have nowhere to climb away.
- Dodge!

01:09:10.591 --> 01:09:12.203
- Stop it. You!
- Dodge!

01:09:13.461 --> 01:09:14.551
Come on!

01:09:14.675 --> 01:09:16.285
- Dodge! Help me!
- Come on!

01:09:16.408 --> 01:09:17.889
Hurry. Hurry!

01:09:18.013 --> 01:09:19.435
Help! Help! Dodge!

01:09:19.559 --> 01:09:20.970
I'm coming!

01:09:31.609 --> 01:09:32.953
Hurry up, folks.

01:09:45.809 --> 01:09:47.603
Wait! Wait!

01:09:55.363 --> 01:09:57.640
Wait a minute, give me a break.

01:09:58.001 --> 01:10:00.254
- Oi!
- Officer! Come on!

01:10:03.555 --> 01:10:04.515
Wait! Wait!

01:10:04.539 --> 01:10:06.269
This is madness!

01:10:06.393 --> 01:10:07.855
Three, two, one...

01:10:22.891 --> 01:10:24.041
Congratulations!

01:10:25.226 --> 01:10:26.424
All the best.

01:10:30.187 --> 01:10:32.376
Oh Brownlow, you need to get down here
right now.

01:10:37.605 --> 01:10:38.755
Shit!

01:10:39.122 --> 01:10:40.478
Shit! Shit!

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:43.000
What the hell.

01:10:43.031 --> 01:10:44.181
Let's go up here.

01:10:46.192 --> 01:10:47.534
I think we lost them.

01:10:47.788 --> 01:10:49.851
They could not have got far Losberne.

01:10:49.975 --> 01:10:51.450
Well, you better be right.

01:10:52.397 --> 01:10:54.717
- Hey! Hey! Don't even think about it.
- Come on, let's go.

01:10:54.786 --> 01:10:56.087
Do not move.

01:10:56.869 --> 01:10:57.869
- Hello?
- Hello, mate.

01:10:57.950 --> 01:10:58.719
Your delivery is here.

01:10:58.743 --> 01:11:00.383
What do you mean?
I didn't order anything.

01:11:00.410 --> 01:11:02.616
- Hey! Don't!
- Let's go! Let's go!

01:11:03.985 --> 01:11:05.135
Hey!

01:11:05.559 --> 01:11:06.837
Hey! Get off the way!

01:11:07.177 --> 01:11:08.861
- Come back here!
- They're getting away!

01:11:08.985 --> 01:11:09.985
Come back!

01:11:10.035 --> 01:11:11.414
Get off my way!

01:11:11.730 --> 01:11:13.110
Stop! Stop!

01:11:13.423 --> 01:11:15.096
You bastard!

01:11:32.498 --> 01:11:35.331
There is only one person
who could do this.

01:11:41.380 --> 01:11:42.618
Batesy.

01:11:42.905 --> 01:11:44.595
Enjoyed your munch, did ya?

01:11:44.770 --> 01:11:49.588
You magnificent bastard,
you had us worried sick, mate.

01:11:49.712 --> 01:11:51.009
Where are you?

01:11:51.133 --> 01:11:53.918
Well, you know, Sikes has gone
full blown psycho, don't ya?

01:11:54.042 --> 01:11:55.421
- She tried to kill me.
- What?

01:11:55.545 --> 01:11:56.909
We are on our way to see her now.

01:11:57.033 --> 01:11:58.717
No, don't. It ain't safe.

01:11:58.841 --> 01:12:01.220
What do you mean? We got no choice.

01:12:01.344 --> 01:12:03.733
Red's with her. We're all heading
to Fagin's.

01:12:04.332 --> 01:12:06.724
Alright, I will meet you there.
Just look after yourself.

01:12:06.848 --> 01:12:07.998
Okay.

01:12:08.810 --> 01:12:11.214
That was Batesy, he's...

01:12:13.225 --> 01:12:14.597
Twist?

01:12:19.033 --> 01:12:20.183
Twist?

01:12:23.912 --> 01:12:24.912
You're late.

01:12:24.978 --> 01:12:26.167
Where is he?

01:12:26.527 --> 01:12:28.033
I don't know, we got split up.

01:12:28.157 --> 01:12:29.688
- He's got it?
- Yes.

01:12:30.362 --> 01:12:31.520
Oi!

01:12:31.984 --> 01:12:34.180
- You missed me?
- Bates.

01:12:34.712 --> 01:12:36.358
Are you alright? What happened?

01:12:36.442 --> 01:12:38.370
I thought I've dealt
with you for fuck sake.

01:12:38.950 --> 01:12:41.299
- Where is Twist?
- I'm right here.

01:12:48.690 --> 01:12:50.634
You want the painting,
she's coming with me.

01:12:51.654 --> 01:12:53.470
Do you think she's worth it?

01:12:56.675 --> 01:12:58.151
Try me.

01:12:59.535 --> 01:13:01.279
Do what he says.

01:13:05.955 --> 01:13:08.209
You got more stones
than I gave you credit for.

01:13:10.540 --> 01:13:11.696
Give me that!

01:13:17.172 --> 01:13:18.965
I'll always be a step ahead of ya.

01:13:22.498 --> 01:13:24.424
You think you could just take my girl?

01:13:25.149 --> 01:13:26.679
It's the painting Sikes.

01:13:26.803 --> 01:13:29.341
Give me the envelope and let him go.

01:13:30.046 --> 01:13:31.585
You sure that's it, Fagin?

01:13:36.385 --> 01:13:38.265
- What?
- The painting.

01:13:38.966 --> 01:13:40.576
Are you sure it's the right one?

01:13:44.854 --> 01:13:45.800
Easy.

01:13:45.824 --> 01:13:47.013
Easy.

01:13:47.476 --> 01:13:49.324
Just reaching for my phone.

01:13:50.057 --> 01:13:51.906
You guys might wanna see this.

01:13:57.388 --> 01:13:59.642
You see, before I got into Graffiti...

01:14:00.019 --> 01:14:01.574
I used to paint.

01:14:01.919 --> 01:14:04.513
Well, your lot mentioning
Hogarth got me inspired.

01:14:05.404 --> 01:14:07.070
It's not bad, eh, Fagin?

01:14:07.519 --> 01:14:08.955
Where is it?

01:14:09.386 --> 01:14:11.488
I walk out of here with Red.

01:14:12.007 --> 01:14:13.496
I call you and tell you
where it is.

01:14:13.620 --> 01:14:15.016
She stays with me.

01:14:15.987 --> 01:14:18.134
We need the painting, Sikes.

01:14:18.258 --> 01:14:19.653
Whose side are you on?

01:14:19.777 --> 01:14:22.917
All this, has got to stop.
You're done. We're done.

01:14:23.041 --> 01:14:24.723
All bets are off.

01:14:24.925 --> 01:14:26.377
Get me the envelope.

01:14:26.514 --> 01:14:28.282
And I'll let you leave.

01:14:41.357 --> 01:14:42.745
Come on.

01:14:43.529 --> 01:14:45.417
You let me leave?

01:14:51.462 --> 01:14:53.358
I choose how this ends.

01:14:54.142 --> 01:14:56.395
- Hey!
- Fagin, Fagin.

01:14:56.589 --> 01:14:57.890
Fagin!

01:15:03.460 --> 01:15:04.753
Come on!

01:15:05.350 --> 01:15:06.434
Quick!

01:15:06.558 --> 01:15:08.026
Come on, Twist!

01:15:20.066 --> 01:15:21.231
Come on!

01:15:26.346 --> 01:15:27.346
You go first.

01:15:27.418 --> 01:15:28.740
I'm not going without you.

01:15:28.864 --> 01:15:31.118
Listen, jump, I will be right behind you.

01:15:31.477 --> 01:15:32.667
Go.

01:15:50.045 --> 01:15:52.179
Twist! Twist! Hold on.

01:15:52.303 --> 01:15:53.905
Come on, come on!

01:15:59.532 --> 01:16:01.428
Twist! Hold on!

01:16:01.552 --> 01:16:02.924
Don't let go.

01:16:09.377 --> 01:16:10.575
Come on!

01:16:11.156 --> 01:16:13.378
No! No!

01:16:15.209 --> 01:16:16.444
Pull him upside.

01:16:16.568 --> 01:16:17.664
I'm sure he will be alright.

01:16:17.688 --> 01:16:18.636
Step back.

01:16:18.660 --> 01:16:21.620
The kid is not even strong enough
to pull himself up? If he's so weak...

01:16:21.722 --> 01:16:23.117
He is not weak.

01:16:23.241 --> 01:16:24.438
You need to come with me.

01:16:24.553 --> 01:16:26.061
I don't need you anymore, Sikes.

01:16:26.114 --> 01:16:27.791
You think Twist will love you.

01:16:27.871 --> 01:16:29.918
He is more than you'll ever be...

01:16:32.859 --> 01:16:34.009
Sikes!

01:16:50.717 --> 01:16:52.404
What a fine thing...

01:16:52.528 --> 01:16:53.971
capital punishment is.

01:17:15.531 --> 01:17:17.059
ONE WEEK LATER

01:17:26.759 --> 01:17:28.424
Young man.

01:17:31.438 --> 01:17:33.644
I'm guessing you heard about the reward.

01:17:37.547 --> 01:17:39.102
Be there in five.

01:17:43.945 --> 01:17:46.275
Do we know what we're meant to be
waiting for?

01:17:46.501 --> 01:17:48.254
We don't have a clue, Bedwin.

01:17:49.165 --> 01:17:50.412
I'm sure no one we see here.

01:17:50.536 --> 01:17:52.857
He's not exactly just
gonna stroll in. Is he?

01:17:52.986 --> 01:17:54.292
He's literally just strolled in.

01:17:54.416 --> 01:17:55.796
Alright lads.

01:17:56.023 --> 01:17:56.781
You hungry?

01:17:56.805 --> 01:17:58.461
You got a lot of nerves
showing up here, kid.

01:17:58.492 --> 01:18:00.689
- Let's just nick him now.
- Calm down, Bedwin.

01:18:00.778 --> 01:18:02.215
You like two baked sunny?

01:18:02.294 --> 01:18:05.609
This might be very funny to you but it's
serious. I need your full co-operation.

01:18:05.672 --> 01:18:07.676
Whoa, whoa. Co-operation?

01:18:08.345 --> 01:18:09.892
I have done you guys a favor.

01:18:10.602 --> 01:18:11.799
How's that?

01:18:12.056 --> 01:18:13.261
Where is the painting?

01:18:13.598 --> 01:18:15.731
- I don't have it.
- So, where is it?

01:18:15.855 --> 01:18:17.614
I'm not the criminal here, in fact...

01:18:17.738 --> 01:18:19.354
I've done the work for you guys.

01:18:19.478 --> 01:18:21.459
- Two baked Sunny's. Enjoy.
- Thanks.

01:18:21.583 --> 01:18:23.691
Excuse me I didn't order this.

01:18:23.815 --> 01:18:25.258
No, it's fine.

01:18:25.522 --> 01:18:26.669
It's my treat.

01:18:26.793 --> 01:18:28.353
Well that's very kind
of you, young man.

01:18:28.389 --> 01:18:29.443
Yes, very kind.

01:18:29.567 --> 01:18:31.170
But don't think this is
getting you out of trouble.

01:18:31.194 --> 01:18:32.965
I need you to understand one thing.

01:18:33.181 --> 01:18:35.061
You gonna need to
start co-operating.

01:18:38.608 --> 01:18:39.797
Ah, brilliant.

01:18:49.539 --> 01:18:51.584
Yeah, hello, yeah,
very smart, that was.

01:18:51.708 --> 01:18:53.181
A wise cop once said to me:

01:18:53.305 --> 01:18:55.114
people only see what they wanna see.

01:18:55.370 --> 01:18:57.923
You'd be wanting some brown sauce
with those, I assume.

01:18:58.047 --> 01:18:59.663
What do you mean brown... Hello?

01:19:00.040 --> 01:19:01.190
Hello?

01:19:03.441 --> 01:19:04.829
Brown sauce.

01:19:12.848 --> 01:19:15.617
It's above the brown sauce,
Bedwin, it's above the brown sauce.

01:19:17.496 --> 01:19:18.860
Holy shit.

01:19:33.772 --> 01:19:37.103
<i>The tale of the stolen Hogarth
in an audacious way</i>

01:19:37.227 --> 01:19:38.606
<i>took a bizarre twist today</i>

01:19:38.730 --> 01:19:42.070
<i>when a tip off led detectives
to a lockup in East London.</i>

01:19:42.194 --> 01:19:45.939
<i>In which a large collection of stolen
artworks has been discovered.</i>

01:19:46.063 --> 01:19:50.205
<i>The lockup belonged to the art dealer
Dr Crispin Losberne.</i>

01:19:51.068 --> 01:19:53.184
<i>Documents that were also found
proving that</i>

01:19:53.308 --> 01:19:57.624
<i>Dr Crispin Losberne is not
the legal owner of the Hogarth.</i>

01:19:57.782 --> 01:20:01.824
<i>It's alleged that the well established
art dealer has been making his fortune</i>

01:20:01.948 --> 01:20:04.046
<i>out off selling stolen artwork</i>

01:20:04.170 --> 01:20:06.580
<i>and faking the
ownership documentation.</i>

01:20:06.704 --> 01:20:09.686
<i>A Mr Issac Solomon has
been named as an accomplice</i>

01:20:09.810 --> 01:20:13.547
<i>is believed that this man also
goes by the name of Fagin.</i>

01:20:14.356 --> 01:20:17.329
Fagin and Sikes really had
raised some good thieves.

01:20:17.453 --> 01:20:20.126
So good, that they didn't know
when they were the target.

01:20:24.618 --> 01:20:27.037
The envelope revealed
the true owners of Hogarth.

01:20:27.161 --> 01:20:30.715
And the key to the lockup where
Losberne kept his stolen paintings.

01:20:40.853 --> 01:20:41.906
Holy shit!

01:20:42.030 --> 01:20:44.450
Even Bedwin and Brownlow
deserved the break.

01:20:44.577 --> 01:20:46.475
<i>In other arts related news,</i>

01:20:46.599 --> 01:20:49.296
<i>a mystery painting arrived
with a special delivery</i>

01:20:49.420 --> 01:20:52.768
<i>for a new exhibition at the
National Gallery last week.</i>

01:20:53.193 --> 01:20:56.954
<i>The question everyone asking is
how did it get there.</i>

01:20:57.611 --> 01:21:00.650
<i>The painting was added
to the exhibition by mistake</i>

01:21:00.774 --> 01:21:03.912

wild for this unknown artist,</i>

01:21:04.036 --> 01:21:06.972
<i>demanded the piece remains on display.</i>

01:21:11.631 --> 01:21:12.837
There you go, mum.

01:21:17.405 --> 01:21:20.940
<i>In fact people can't stop
talking about the mystery artist</i>

01:21:21.064 --> 01:21:23.465
<i>with many asking
who is Molly Twist and</i>

01:21:23.589 --> 01:21:26.684
<i>when and where will
more of her work appear.</i>

01:21:26.808 --> 01:21:29.328
<i>Dealers are said to
be willing to offer up to</i>

01:21:29.452 --> 01:21:33.140
<i>fifty thousand to anyone
with an original Twist antique.</i>

01:21:50.701 --> 01:21:51.851
Cheers, Nancy.

01:21:54.237 --> 01:21:57.347
Call me that again, Oliver, and I
will twist something you don't like.

01:21:59.282 --> 01:22:01.606
Quit canoodling.

01:22:04.223 --> 01:22:05.373
So...

01:22:05.527 --> 01:22:07.222
you are gonna stick with us, kid?

01:22:07.346 --> 01:22:09.175
Come on, you know you wanna...

01:22:09.299 --> 01:22:11.203
Look, if I'm gonna be staying around

01:22:11.359 --> 01:22:13.434
we gotta cut out all the nonsense
and go straight.

01:22:13.558 --> 01:22:16.526
Whoa, hey, he's joking right?
That must be a joke.

01:22:16.901 --> 01:22:20.381
What exactly do you expect
us lot to do for a job, eh?

01:22:21.199 --> 01:22:23.166
You ever thought about selling paintings?

01:22:23.870 --> 01:22:26.567
A bag full of Molly Twist
now is worth a few quid.

01:22:29.741 --> 01:22:32.716
Like I said, no singing, no dancing.

01:22:32.910 --> 01:22:35.211
But maybe I was wrong about
the happy ending.

01:22:36.176 --> 01:22:37.586
I know these people.

01:22:37.710 --> 01:22:39.095
I belong with them.
