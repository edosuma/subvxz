WEBVTT

00:01.234 --> 00:01.434
.

00:06.439 --> 00:08.173
'The Geordie squad are back.'

00:08.241 --> 00:10.543
This time, it's gonna be massive.

00:10.610 --> 00:13.079
Fuck off, Newcastle.

00:13.146 --> 00:16.983
We're gonna mission
around all the party islands.

00:17.050 --> 00:21.121
(screaming)

00:21.187 --> 00:24.290
Things are about to get
Lionel Messi.

00:25.525 --> 00:27.961
There's gonna be pool parties.

00:28.027 --> 00:30.530
Boat parties.

00:30.597 --> 00:32.131
Paint parties.

00:32.198 --> 00:34.567
The biggest parties
of our fucking lives.

00:36.002 --> 00:38.638
More necking on.

00:38.705 --> 00:40.907
Oh, shit.

00:40.974 --> 00:43.476
There's gonna be
shit loads of bucking.

00:45.478 --> 00:48.548
Belly flop! Belly flop!

00:48.615 --> 00:50.183
Let's fucking do this.

00:51.985 --> 00:54.687
There's gonna be carnage.
Fucking little slag!

00:58.758 --> 01:00.827
Kick-offs.
(shouting)

01:00.894 --> 01:04.497
Marnie, Marnie!

01:04.563 --> 01:06.366
Drama.

01:08.935 --> 01:10.570
Oh, my God!
(siren)

01:10.637 --> 01:14.174
Let's get fucking mortal.

01:14.240 --> 01:17.310
This is the ultimate
party island crawl.

01:19.279 --> 01:23.516
(farts) Welcome to the girls' room,
you little radge packet!

01:23.583 --> 01:25.285
We're not friends.
Not friends?

01:25.351 --> 01:28.254
I have no feelings for Chloe.
She needs to nash on.

01:29.889 --> 01:31.424
I'm fucking fuming.

01:32.892 --> 01:35.595
I don't know why
I used to like this bird.

01:37.764 --> 01:41.067
Marnie keeps kissing Chloe
and thinking it's all right.

01:41.134 --> 01:43.436
There's no way
I can live with Marnie.

01:43.503 --> 01:45.271
I don't see us ever coming back.

01:48.041 --> 01:49.809
Time for Scotty T to check out.

01:49.876 --> 01:53.246
Au-rev-fucking-oir.

01:53.313 --> 01:56.916
Have I had one too many sangrias,
or is Gaz necking on with Chantelle?

01:56.983 --> 02:00.386
What the fuck?
Who's your fucking baby?

02:00.453 --> 02:03.656
It's Sophie!
Gary and Chantelle have kissed.

02:03.723 --> 02:06.092
Now I feel like shit.

02:06.159 --> 02:08.394
I have lost all trust in that girl.

02:10.430 --> 02:13.166
Do one, man.

02:13.233 --> 02:15.535
Right now, I hate Gary.

02:15.602 --> 02:19.572
I'm ending the night with a shag.
It's a good time to be alive.

02:21.307 --> 02:23.243
I have a degree in pulling women.

02:23.309 --> 02:25.578
I'd never kiss anyone
without a six-pack.

02:25.645 --> 02:28.748
I'm a natural beauty,
real boobs, real hair.

02:28.815 --> 02:30.717
I'm gonna tear the place up.

02:30.783 --> 02:33.419
I'm radge and I wrap
lads around my finger.

02:33.486 --> 02:35.455
I'm preened to perfection.

02:35.522 --> 02:37.357
I'm totally crackers me, like.

02:37.423 --> 02:39.626
I'm cheeky and full of mischief.

02:39.692 --> 02:41.561
Me banter's pure naughty.

02:41.628 --> 02:43.997
I'm fake, flirty
and I've got double Fs.

02:44.063 --> 02:46.466
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

02:56.709 --> 03:01.214
Last night was wicked. I shagged
and Gaz didn't. He must be ill.

03:01.281 --> 03:03.816
I'm making him a cup of coffee
to cheer him up.

03:03.883 --> 03:07.186
Cos he's getting on a bit and he
needs that kick start to the day.

03:07.253 --> 03:09.656
Gary. Morning.

03:09.722 --> 03:12.492
Coffee?
Yes.

03:12.559 --> 03:16.930
With Scott and Aaron away, it's good
to Marty to talk about all the shit.

03:25.104 --> 03:28.808
Last night got out of control. Me
and Sophie had the biggest argument.

03:28.875 --> 03:32.045
It's not what I wanted,
but I knew it was gonna happen.

03:38.084 --> 03:42.121
I understand her anger, cos they're
friends, but I'm not with her.

03:51.197 --> 03:53.700
I had a really big argument
with Gary.

03:53.766 --> 03:56.469
I got so angry
so I just swilled him.

03:56.536 --> 03:57.971
Are you gonna apologise?

03:58.037 --> 04:00.173
I will apologise for swilling him.

04:00.239 --> 04:02.575
But not for what you said?
Not for what I said.

04:02.642 --> 04:06.412
The fact that Gary necked on
with someone in the house,

04:06.479 --> 04:08.982
is what I find so disrespectful.

04:09.048 --> 04:12.585
And I know it's gonna hurt her
so much when she finds out.

04:12.652 --> 04:15.555
What happened with Marty then?
Did he bring a girl back?

04:16.856 --> 04:20.093
It did hurt. I did wanna cry.
But I just ignored it.

04:20.159 --> 04:23.563
Even though Marty pulled last night,
I still really like him.

04:23.630 --> 04:27.967
I hope me ignoring him, he'll realise
what he's missing and run back to us.

04:28.034 --> 04:31.004
Peanut butter jelly!

04:39.045 --> 04:40.780
(Sophie screams)

04:40.847 --> 04:42.548
Sophie, you fucking tit!

04:42.615 --> 04:43.916
That's not very nice.

04:43.983 --> 04:47.587
We're chilling in the bedroom
and we're starting to get hungover

04:47.654 --> 04:50.456
and a bit bored,
we need a bit of excitement.

04:50.523 --> 04:51.891
I wanna have fun.

04:51.958 --> 04:53.626
What are we gonna do?
Anything.

04:53.693 --> 04:55.762
I have an idea.
What?

04:55.828 --> 04:59.666
Right. I think we should go
on a boat tour.

04:59.732 --> 05:01.200
Oh, my God. I'd like that.

05:01.267 --> 05:03.302
What a wicked idea.

05:03.369 --> 05:05.538
The sea air is gonna clear
my hangover.

05:05.605 --> 05:07.774
I think it would be best
if just we go.

05:07.840 --> 05:10.176
Cos obviously you had
an argument with Gary.

05:10.243 --> 05:14.747
After Sophie's arrival and her
argument with Gary, I feel awkward.

05:14.814 --> 05:18.718
Hopefully, being stuck on a boat
won't make matters worse.

05:19.552 --> 05:21.254
You were funny last night, mind.

05:21.320 --> 05:24.323
I don't give a fuck what we do
as long as I get out this villa

05:24.390 --> 05:27.860
and away from Tweedledum
and Tweedle-fucking-tit

05:27.927 --> 05:29.696
(Holly) Bye!
(Nathan) Bye, boys!

05:29.762 --> 05:32.098
Where the fuck are they going?
Bye.

05:32.165 --> 05:34.567
See ya later, Nathan.
See you later, Holly.

05:34.634 --> 05:38.971
Me and Nathan say bye to the lads.
We hear, "Bye, Holly. Bye, Nathan."

05:39.038 --> 05:40.506
Well, this is awkward.

05:41.407 --> 05:42.942
Fuck!

05:43.009 --> 05:45.678
I'm glad the girls have pissed off.
(Marty shouts)

05:45.745 --> 05:48.281
It means me and Marty
get the villa to ourselves.

05:48.347 --> 05:50.983
There's no-one here! Fuck off!

05:51.050 --> 05:52.351
Fuck off!

05:58.491 --> 06:00.660
(cheering)

06:00.727 --> 06:03.763
It's so nice to be away
from the drama, away from Gary

06:03.830 --> 06:06.733
and just have fun with the girls

06:06.799 --> 06:08.968
Oh, my God, yous,
look at that beach.

06:09.035 --> 06:11.871
This is gorgeous.

06:14.006 --> 06:17.877
This sea looks amazing.
I just can't wait to dive in.

06:18.945 --> 06:21.047
(splash, laughter)

06:21.114 --> 06:23.249
OK. I'm no Tom Daley,

06:23.316 --> 06:26.319
but at least I don't need armbands
like Chloe.

06:26.385 --> 06:28.488
Get in, you can swim then. Howay.

06:28.554 --> 06:30.823
I've just remembered I can't swim.

06:30.890 --> 06:33.960
So, I've got my armbands on.
I just hope there's no sharks.

06:36.129 --> 06:37.530
Ah! There's a shark.

06:37.597 --> 06:40.133
I wanna forget about last night
with me and Gary,

06:40.199 --> 06:44.203
it's my first day here and I'm more
interested about Marnie and Aaron.

06:45.905 --> 06:48.508
How do you feel Aaron now then?

06:48.574 --> 06:52.979
Honestly, Sophie, I can't begin
to tell you how angry I am.

06:53.045 --> 06:56.182
How dare he just leave?
What was it over?

06:56.249 --> 06:59.452
I don't know. He didn't
speak to us, so I don't know.

06:59.519 --> 07:01.988
We didn't speak for two days
before he went.

07:02.054 --> 07:05.658
I can't believe Aaron left us
like that, I thought I meant more.

07:05.725 --> 07:07.827
If he came back,
what would happen then?

07:07.894 --> 07:09.729
I'd pretend he didn't exist.

07:09.796 --> 07:12.265
Is that the end then,
do you reckon?

07:12.331 --> 07:14.333
Yeah, as friends as well.

07:14.400 --> 07:16.068
I've known these two for years.

07:16.135 --> 07:19.205
I've seen them outside this villa
and I know they get along,

07:19.272 --> 07:22.475
I hope Aaron comes back
so they can sort it out.

07:29.048 --> 07:30.716
Right...

07:33.553 --> 07:37.023
I am sick of all this bitching.
I need to ask Gaz

07:37.089 --> 07:39.859
if necking on with Chantelle
was worth all this shit.

07:39.926 --> 07:42.161
Why did you do it?
I didn't wanna bang her,

07:42.228 --> 07:45.898
I didn't wanna... Nothing
was gonna happen, it was just...

07:45.965 --> 07:47.300
...I just necked on.

07:47.366 --> 07:50.436
If I knew Sophie was gonna pop up,
I wouldn't have necked on.

07:50.503 --> 07:54.407
She means nothing to me.
Me and Sophie have got a big history.

08:07.053 --> 08:10.089
I've noticed Chantelle's
been quiet, and I'm worried,

08:10.156 --> 08:11.824
cos she's leaving herself out.

08:11.891 --> 08:14.727
How are you feeling?
About Sophie being back?

08:14.794 --> 08:17.463
With her finding out about
the kissing Gary thing.

08:17.530 --> 08:20.166
At the end of the day,
there's nothing I can say

08:20.233 --> 08:23.169
cos I would stick up
for my best friend regardless.

08:23.236 --> 08:24.804
I do regret kissing him.

08:24.871 --> 08:28.541
I understand Sophie being upset,
being Charlotte's friend.

08:28.608 --> 08:32.278
Despite feeling I've done nothing
wrong, I'm gonna keep my head down.

08:32.345 --> 08:35.648
It's all out now. You and Gary
aren't seeing each other, so...

08:35.715 --> 08:38.183
it's best to move on
from it and have fun.

08:38.251 --> 08:41.654
After talking to Chantelle,
I'm worried she's feeling left out.

08:41.721 --> 08:45.424
Hopefully we can all go out tonight
and have a laugh together.

08:48.160 --> 08:50.263
It's amazing to get away
from the villa,

08:50.329 --> 08:53.232
but now we need to get back
and get ready for tonight.

09:03.376 --> 09:04.877
Last card!

09:04.944 --> 09:06.812
You didn't need to say that as well.

09:08.080 --> 09:09.482
Come on then, bitches.

09:09.548 --> 09:11.717
We get back, we've had a wicked day.

09:11.784 --> 09:14.186
I wonder what Gary and Marty
have been up to.

09:14.253 --> 09:16.489
Hello.

09:16.555 --> 09:20.426
Nathan and the girls come back. Let
me guess, you've had the best day.

09:20.493 --> 09:21.627
Hi, boys!

09:21.694 --> 09:26.065
We had the best day ever.

09:26.132 --> 09:28.067
Today has been absolutely wicked

09:28.134 --> 09:30.569
and it's brought everyone's
energy levels up.

09:30.636 --> 09:34.674
I hope everyone can put the shit
aside and we can go out as a family.

09:39.412 --> 09:43.049
I think you should go for a poo.
I've tried. Push.

09:43.115 --> 09:46.786
You need a water pistol
to squirt up your arse.

09:46.852 --> 09:50.890
Just sit there and rock back and
forth. When I need a poo, I do this.

09:52.091 --> 09:55.127
We're sitting, Marnie's moaning
about constipation

09:55.194 --> 09:58.064
and the door opens.
Who the fuck is this?

09:58.130 --> 09:59.765
Oi, oi!

10:04.203 --> 10:08.174
Fuck, Aaron's just walked
through the door.

10:08.240 --> 10:12.478
Marnie, if you haven't had the
shits, I bet you've got them now.

10:12.545 --> 10:17.116
For fuck's sake, Aaron's just walked
in. I'm not prepared for this.

10:18.250 --> 10:20.820
Nathan is absolutely mortal.

10:20.886 --> 10:23.456
He's that pissed,
he's forgot his sexuality.

10:23.522 --> 10:26.258
(crying)
I've seen Marnie's crying.

10:26.325 --> 10:28.260
It's all getting too much for us.

10:28.327 --> 10:31.397
Bastard!
Here's Nathan!

10:31.464 --> 10:33.632
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

10:36.002 --> 10:36.202
.

10:38.771 --> 10:41.707
'Oi, oi, this part contains
strong language.'

10:41.774 --> 10:44.677
'If you don't like sexual banter,
nudity and the rest,

10:44.744 --> 10:46.045
please turn over now.'

10:48.914 --> 10:51.283
Oi, oi.

10:51.350 --> 10:52.685
Get in!

10:52.752 --> 10:55.221
What the hell?

10:55.287 --> 10:57.690
For fuck's sake.
Aaron's just walked in.

10:57.757 --> 10:59.825
I am not prepared for this.

11:01.327 --> 11:05.097
It feels good to be back, but it
doesn't look like Marnie is pleased.

11:05.164 --> 11:07.800
What the fuck?
Hang on, what's Sophie doing here?

11:07.867 --> 11:09.769
At least she's pleased to see us.

11:09.835 --> 11:11.704
What the fuck are you doing here?

11:11.771 --> 11:14.907
I know Marnie's not getting on
with Aaron, but I like him.

11:14.974 --> 11:19.578
I'm glad to see him and I know he's
a better lad than them two idiots.

11:19.645 --> 11:21.680
Why weren't you here? What happened?

11:21.747 --> 11:24.116
Just a few things.
My head was a bit battered.

11:24.183 --> 11:26.318
With the whole Marnie situation,
so...

11:26.385 --> 11:29.855
I thought instead of arguing
and spoiling people's nights,

11:29.922 --> 11:31.257
just sorted my head out.

11:31.323 --> 11:34.760
Aaron said he had to leave cos
of the arguments that were going on.

11:34.827 --> 11:39.131
Whoa, whoa, mate. You've just
stepped into something worse.

11:39.198 --> 11:41.867
Is it Aaron? Did he say anything?

11:41.934 --> 11:43.669
No, I walked away.
Good.

11:45.504 --> 11:48.441
Who does he think he is?
Fucking off then waltzing back?

11:48.507 --> 11:51.744
Happy as Larry as if nowt's wrong.
Like you haven't been hurt.

11:51.811 --> 11:53.813
As if I haven't been hurt.
Cheeky fuck.

11:53.879 --> 11:56.015
I feel for Marnie,
but I can't help think

11:56.082 --> 12:00.486
there's a lot of history between her
and Aaron, so this isn't the end.

12:01.754 --> 12:04.123
Where's, er, Scott? Asleep?

12:04.190 --> 12:06.725
Mate, he's in a bad way.
You want to see his hand.

12:06.792 --> 12:09.528
He flew back to get his arm sorted.
He'll be back.

12:09.595 --> 12:11.130
I'm gutted Scott's not here.

12:11.197 --> 12:14.133
I leave for five minutes
and he breaks his hand.

12:14.200 --> 12:15.501
What a fucking idiot.

12:15.568 --> 12:18.504
I'm excited. Let's just get ready.
Can we get ready?

12:18.571 --> 12:20.739
I'm gonna get some food.

12:20.806 --> 12:22.942
I am so pleased that Aaron is back.

12:23.008 --> 12:26.745
Before we go out, I need to see
where his head's at with Marnie.

12:28.714 --> 12:31.917
I've come back to do what I want.
No-one can tell us what to do.

12:31.984 --> 12:35.254
I'm not in a relationship,
clearly, so...

12:35.321 --> 12:39.091
The big question is, we're on the
pull, are you joining or what?

12:39.158 --> 12:41.694
If you're not with her,
then come on the pull

12:41.760 --> 12:43.429
and shut the fuck up about her.

12:43.496 --> 12:45.097
Come on, son!

12:45.164 --> 12:46.899
We'll see. We'll see.

12:46.966 --> 12:50.002
The lads think I'm going on the pull,
but I'm a long way off.

12:50.069 --> 12:53.439
I've got unresolved business
with Marnie I need to deal with.

12:53.506 --> 12:55.608
Boys, we're back!

13:03.015 --> 13:07.486
Tonight's gonna be wicked, cos me
Gaz and Aaron are gonna go akka.

13:13.159 --> 13:18.197
I don't want arguments now.
I'm gonna have a classy night.

13:18.264 --> 13:22.201
Marnie may want a classy night, but
all I want is her to speak to Aaron,

13:22.268 --> 13:25.704
Sophie and Gary to make up
and Marty and Chloe not to kick off.

13:25.771 --> 13:28.073
That's not too much to ask, is it?

13:31.744 --> 13:34.246
This is what I've waited for
all day.

13:38.250 --> 13:41.353
Music, dancing and alcohol.

13:47.793 --> 13:50.963
This place is amazing.
It's full of pure wicked birds.

13:51.030 --> 13:53.265
Us lads need to get out
and get on the pull.

14:00.406 --> 14:02.241
What do these lads not understand?

14:02.308 --> 14:05.411
If Marnie says it's over
and she wants nothing to do with us,

14:05.477 --> 14:07.413
I'm not gonna go on the pull.

14:08.647 --> 14:12.518
Aaron, what is the matter? You're
single and here's girls everywhere.

14:12.585 --> 14:14.086
Don't go soft on me.

14:20.993 --> 14:23.862
I wanna clear the air with Gary
after the argument

14:23.929 --> 14:26.632
to make things better
for everyone in the house.

14:35.874 --> 14:39.144
Me, Charlotte and Gary used to
call ourselves the tripod,

14:39.211 --> 14:41.180
and we were so, so close.

14:41.247 --> 14:43.882
It upsets us
that we'll never be the same.

14:51.790 --> 14:55.527
Sophie dropped the bombshell that
Charlotte's not over us. News to me.

14:55.594 --> 14:59.164
No wonder she kicked off at me so
much for necking on with Chantelle.

15:04.036 --> 15:06.705
I respect Sophie for her loyalty
to Charlotte.

15:06.772 --> 15:09.174
I would do exactly the same
if it was for Aaron.

15:12.411 --> 15:15.047
I'm devastated we're never
gonna be best friends.

15:15.114 --> 15:17.016
But this is the best way forward.

15:23.989 --> 15:26.025
Looks like Aaron's
having a good time.

15:26.091 --> 15:29.795
I can't believe he hasn't tried to
speak to us. What a twat.

15:32.331 --> 15:35.401
I've noticed that Chantelle
is looking a bit lonely,

15:35.467 --> 15:37.636
so I asked her
for pole dancing tips

15:37.703 --> 15:40.172
to show Marty what he's missing.

15:43.909 --> 15:47.479
Move over, bitches.
Let me show you how it's done.

15:54.753 --> 15:56.622
Nathan is absolutely mortal.

15:56.689 --> 15:58.524
Who the hell
does he think he is? Me?

16:03.495 --> 16:05.731
What the fuck
has happened to Nathan?

16:05.798 --> 16:09.568
He's that pissed he's actually
forgot his sexuality.

16:09.635 --> 16:14.940
I haven't had sex in a while and
this is the closest I'm gonna get.

16:15.007 --> 16:19.244
It's just a shame it's with Chloe
and she's a girl.

16:24.750 --> 16:28.921
I might have been gone for a few
days, but some things don't change.

16:28.987 --> 16:31.090
Chloe can't help
flirting with Marty.

16:35.761 --> 16:37.663
Drunk Chloe is my worst nightmare.

16:37.730 --> 16:40.499
When she's not drinking, we get on.

16:40.566 --> 16:43.469
So, if I don't pull,
I've always got her to fall back on.

16:52.811 --> 16:55.414
For the second night in a row,
I haven't got mortal

16:55.481 --> 16:57.816
and me and Marty have been
getting on unreal.

16:57.883 --> 17:01.553
If things keep going like this, we
could be boyfriend and girlfriend.

17:04.356 --> 17:07.459
My first night back and I'm having
a fun night with the lads.

17:07.526 --> 17:10.996
I've noticed Marnie isn't look
too happy. I need to speak to her.

17:14.633 --> 17:16.801
I'm not enjoying this night at all.

17:16.868 --> 17:20.638
Me and Aaron aren't speaking.
It's awkward. I dunno where to look.

17:20.705 --> 17:23.242
It's all getting too much for us.

17:24.742 --> 17:28.947
I've worked myself up to the point
where I've burst into tears.

17:29.948 --> 17:31.283
You're not a stupid girl.

17:31.350 --> 17:33.519
I've looked over
and seen Marnie crying,

17:33.585 --> 17:36.255
my instinct is to make sure
she's all right.

17:39.758 --> 17:44.229
Aaron's trying to comfort us, but it
shouldn't take me crying for that.

17:50.068 --> 17:52.604
I left the villa cos of all
the drama with Marnie.

17:52.671 --> 17:55.607
But time apart has made us realise
what the problem is.

18:02.448 --> 18:04.716
I have never been able
to understand Aaron,

18:04.783 --> 18:08.587
I never know what he thinks, so
him telling us is a massive step.

18:17.229 --> 18:20.532
I feels really good to have opened
up to Marnie about how I feel.

18:20.599 --> 18:25.170
I really care for her. Hopefully
it's a step in right direction.

18:25.237 --> 18:28.106
I'm so pleased me and Aaron
have had a heart-to-heart.

18:28.173 --> 18:31.143
I'm still so confused
as to what we are to each other.

18:35.547 --> 18:38.283
Tonight has gone
far too far for me.

18:38.350 --> 18:41.653
I need to get home now
before I do something stupid.

18:49.394 --> 18:52.097
Hi, darlings! Hi, bitches!

18:52.164 --> 18:55.501
For the first time in a long time,
everyone's not best friends,

18:55.567 --> 18:58.203
but at least everybody's talking.

18:59.238 --> 19:02.608
Finally, this feels like a house
I used to live in.

19:02.674 --> 19:06.144
We're having a good time
and we're stuffing our fat faces.

19:06.211 --> 19:08.380
We're all a happy family again.

19:08.447 --> 19:10.415
I'm going to bed. Where's my bag?

19:10.482 --> 19:14.653
We get back, the others are partying,
I've had enough. I'm going to bed.

19:14.720 --> 19:17.656
Nothing brings everyone closer
than a prank on Nathan.

19:17.723 --> 19:22.094
I know how much Nathan loves chilli,
especially on his pizza.

19:22.160 --> 19:23.328
Nathan, eat up.

19:23.395 --> 19:25.998
Nathan, you gotta eat
the rest of the food first.

19:26.064 --> 19:28.166
Come on,
I'm just eating it by myself.

19:29.468 --> 19:32.137
I think it's getting a bit chilli
in here, isn't it?

19:32.204 --> 19:35.941
Nathan... Feed him to the lions!

19:36.008 --> 19:39.344
It's just easy pickings, man.

19:39.411 --> 19:41.813
You like that one?

19:46.485 --> 19:47.586
(laughter)

19:47.653 --> 19:50.589
You sly little bitch.

19:50.656 --> 19:52.758
(cheering, laughter)

19:52.824 --> 19:55.928
Spicy, was it?!
Why would you do that to me?

19:57.629 --> 19:58.897
Easy now

19:58.964 --> 20:00.666
Nathan is in a bad way.

20:03.001 --> 20:05.103
Can't even get up the stairs
on his own.

20:06.171 --> 20:07.506
I need some water now.

20:07.573 --> 20:09.508
Yous, I need water now.

20:09.575 --> 20:13.045
Someone just get me
some fucking water.

20:14.079 --> 20:17.616
Water, did you say, Nathan?
I am more than happy to help.

20:19.918 --> 20:22.254
Fuck me, that's hot!

20:23.522 --> 20:26.625
Chilli water,
have some of that, pal.

20:26.692 --> 20:28.160
(coughing) Someone help!

20:28.226 --> 20:30.095
Give him some chilli water.

20:30.162 --> 20:32.764
Trying to get to sleep
and all I can hear is racket.

20:32.831 --> 20:34.499
What the fuck is going on?

20:34.566 --> 20:38.270
(Nathan throws up, screaming)

20:39.871 --> 20:42.507
Ah, here, Nathan,
you aren't looking your best.

20:42.574 --> 20:44.109
Let me give you a makeover.

20:44.176 --> 20:46.445
It's one thing to make me sick,

20:46.511 --> 20:50.048
but it's a whole different level
putting shit in my hair.

20:52.317 --> 20:54.720
You've well and truly
pissed us off now.

20:57.756 --> 21:00.158
All of a sudden, boom!
Like a bat out of hell,

21:00.225 --> 21:03.495
Nathan's up, grabbing his sick bag
and he starts chasing us.

21:06.565 --> 21:09.001
Cheers, Gary. You're the one
who pranked him.

21:09.067 --> 21:10.469
I only put shit in his hair.

21:10.535 --> 21:11.637
Nathan, it wasn't me!

21:11.703 --> 21:15.007
All this running around and
eating chillies must have you hot,

21:15.073 --> 21:17.175
why don't you go for a swim?

21:22.080 --> 21:26.451
We are terrified of Nathan.
I dunno what's got in to him.

21:26.518 --> 21:30.455
He's swinging that sick bag
like a hooker's handbag.

21:30.522 --> 21:31.657
Where are you going?

21:31.723 --> 21:35.160
Everyone is in the house
apart from me. Shock.

21:35.227 --> 21:37.696
You'll never escape, you bitch.

21:37.763 --> 21:41.366
I need to get in there as soon
as possible. So I need to run.

21:48.573 --> 21:50.609
I now feel like
I'm in a horror film.

21:50.676 --> 21:53.145
I am shit scared of Nathan.

21:53.211 --> 21:56.581
Yous genuinely think
yous are fine in that house.

21:56.648 --> 22:00.052
If these motherfuckers think
locking me out of the house

22:00.118 --> 22:04.523
is gonna stop me getting to them,
they have another thing coming.

22:07.759 --> 22:12.764
Then the big, drunk, naked bastard
comes through the window.

22:12.831 --> 22:14.566
Bastard!

22:14.633 --> 22:17.069
And I'm off at this point.
Fuck that.

22:21.440 --> 22:23.442
Here's Nathan!

22:32.751 --> 22:36.688
Tonight's been proper mental.
We've all had such a good laugh.

22:36.755 --> 22:39.858
But enough's enough, Nathan,
let's put you to bed

22:39.925 --> 22:41.693
before you cause any more damage.

22:49.968 --> 22:53.405
Tonight, I've had a laugh. I'm
so glad me and Marnie are talking.

22:53.472 --> 22:56.775
There's more to be said, but for
now, I'm sharing a bed with Gaz.

23:01.747 --> 23:04.883
Me and Marty are getting on well
and I don't have a bed,

23:04.950 --> 23:08.253
so what better than to stay in the
bed next to him, like friends?

23:16.495 --> 23:20.332
I mean, it might have taken Nathan
to be possessed by the devil,

23:20.398 --> 23:24.102
but everyone's actually starting
to look like a family again.

23:24.169 --> 23:25.570
(thud)

23:25.637 --> 23:28.907
He fell out the bed, yous.
He fell out the bed.

23:31.109 --> 23:33.979
Foam party, bitches!
Foam party, bitches!

23:34.045 --> 23:35.480
Get them bubbles!

23:35.547 --> 23:37.415
I'm choking on fucking foam.

23:37.482 --> 23:39.484
Can you make me happy?

23:39.551 --> 23:42.687
I want him to be a good boyfriend.
It's not much to ask.

23:42.754 --> 23:43.989
You don't like her.

23:44.055 --> 23:47.559
Why the fuck is Chantelle getting
involved in other people's shit?

23:47.626 --> 23:50.162
(all) Geordie Shore, why aye!

23:52.531 --> 23:52.731
.

23:55.233 --> 23:59.638
'Alreet? The very bad language
and sex scenes continue throughout.'

23:59.704 --> 24:03.041
'So, if you don't like sexual banter,
nudity and the rest,

24:03.108 --> 24:04.576
please turn over now.'

24:18.223 --> 24:21.059
Last night was one of
the funniest nights of my life.

24:21.126 --> 24:23.295
Nathan was going absolutely berserk.

24:35.473 --> 24:39.010
Last night me and Sophie agreed to
be civil for the sake of the house.

24:39.077 --> 24:42.681
Chantelle wasn't worth all this.
Let's just hope it's sorted.

24:48.520 --> 24:52.257
Marty, I'm buzzing you're talking to
Chloe, but she's a jack in the box.

24:52.324 --> 24:56.895
One minute she's up, down, back,
forwards. She'll kick off whenever.

25:04.035 --> 25:06.538
Last night, I was honest
about my issues.

25:06.605 --> 25:10.308
I know what I need to do, but I need
to tell her before I tell these two.

25:21.052 --> 25:23.455
Yous, it absolutely stinks in here.

25:23.521 --> 25:26.157
Nathan?
I'm in a bad way.

25:26.224 --> 25:29.427
This is the worst hangover
I've ever had in my life.

25:29.494 --> 25:31.429
But last night was a lot of fun.

25:31.496 --> 25:34.900
That was probably one of the
funniest nights I've ever had.

25:34.966 --> 25:38.003
Everyone's going on about
what a fun night they had.

25:38.069 --> 25:41.840
I dunno what it is, I'm just not
feeling like I wanna get involved.

25:43.108 --> 25:45.944
Where the fuck have you been?
Morning, bitches.

25:46.011 --> 25:47.545
You hoebags.

25:47.612 --> 25:49.614
Where've you been?

25:52.083 --> 25:54.419
Me and Martin
are getting on dead well.

25:54.486 --> 25:56.588
So happy that we're good friends.

25:56.655 --> 25:59.824
Chloe's going on about her
and Marty getting on really well.

25:59.891 --> 26:03.028
I hope he's not leading her on
again. He's hurt her enough.

26:03.094 --> 26:06.164
Positive today.
Positive vibes in the air.

26:06.231 --> 26:08.533
I'll make us some brekkie.

26:13.305 --> 26:15.941
Last night, Marnie
and Aaron looked really cosy,

26:16.007 --> 26:18.743
but Marnie said she was
never gonna speak to him.

26:18.810 --> 26:20.578
I need to find out what's going on.

26:20.645 --> 26:24.783
Yesterday you were adamant you were
never gonna speak to Aaron again.

26:24.849 --> 26:27.252
I know.
Why? What happened? What changed?

26:27.319 --> 26:28.820
I don't know, Chloe.

26:28.887 --> 26:32.157
He's got a little bit of a hold
over us and I don't know...

26:32.223 --> 26:36.494
Like, I feel angry at myself
for letting him waltz back in.

26:36.561 --> 26:37.963
Frustrating, isn't it?

26:38.029 --> 26:41.499
We go one step forward,
then ten steps back.

26:41.566 --> 26:45.537
Even though me and Aaron made up,
we're back where we've always been,

26:45.603 --> 26:48.506
in between in a relationship
or single.

26:48.573 --> 26:51.843
We're either gonna have to commit,

26:51.910 --> 26:54.612
or leave it behind us and move on.

26:54.679 --> 26:57.349
I do believe he likes you,
I just think he's shy.

26:57.415 --> 27:00.919
He's gonna have to sort it out cos
I'm not going through this again.

27:00.986 --> 27:03.989
I do agree with Marnie,
I do think Aaron likes her so much,

27:04.055 --> 27:06.725
but he's not had a relationship
and he's scared.

27:06.791 --> 27:09.494
What happened with Martin?
Nothing.

27:09.561 --> 27:13.298
I just got a feeling that he's not
gonna pull, you know, tonight.

27:13.365 --> 27:16.001
I know Chloe's getting on
with Marty at the minute,

27:16.067 --> 27:18.903
but I'm worried that she's getting
her hopes up again.

27:26.011 --> 27:29.848
Us girls are chilling and it feels
like the family's back together.

27:29.914 --> 27:32.217
To celebrate,
I've come up with a mint idea.

27:32.283 --> 27:35.487
Boys! Boys! Boys!

27:35.553 --> 27:39.724
Today, we're all getting well, so I
decided we should go to a foam party.

27:42.560 --> 27:44.829
I cannot fucking wait
for this foam party.

27:44.896 --> 27:48.533
I'm gonna get straight in the mix
and neck on with anything I see.

27:50.235 --> 27:52.337
The only thing with foam,
it stinks.

27:52.404 --> 27:54.406
It dries your skin as well, it does.

27:54.472 --> 27:57.242
You're gonna have to
take some moisturiser.

27:57.308 --> 27:59.411
I'll put it in my fucking handbag.

27:59.477 --> 28:01.179
Let's 'ave it!

28:01.246 --> 28:04.549
Let's get in the foam
and fucking get mortal.

28:09.354 --> 28:12.424
Let's get daytime drunk.
Foam party, let's have it!

28:12.490 --> 28:15.093
(cheering)

28:17.095 --> 28:19.931
Foam party, bitches!
Foam party, bitches!

28:28.440 --> 28:29.908
I'm buzzing about the foam,

28:29.974 --> 28:32.410
but me and Aaron need
to come to a conclusion

28:32.477 --> 28:34.345
to work out what's going on with us.

28:34.412 --> 28:36.848
Are we together?
Are we not? I don't know.

28:48.927 --> 28:52.464
When it comes to Aaron,
I know what I want. I want him.

28:52.530 --> 28:55.366
I want him to be a good boyfriend,
it's not much to ask.

29:11.416 --> 29:15.186
To give it a chance with Marnie,
I'm gonna put my issues to one side

29:15.253 --> 29:17.755
but in return,
she has to fully commit to me, too.

29:23.027 --> 29:25.663
Me and Aaron have made up
and we're back together.

29:25.730 --> 29:27.232
It's amazing.

29:29.033 --> 29:31.503
I look over and Marnie
and Aaron are necking on.

29:31.569 --> 29:34.339
That didn't take long.
Looks like they're together.

29:34.405 --> 29:36.307
Marty, just me and you, kid.

29:43.314 --> 29:46.017
I'm having such a good time
at this party.

29:46.084 --> 29:48.319
I wanna get on the mic
and shout and scream.

29:52.891 --> 29:55.894
I can't get my words out.
I'm choking on foam.

30:03.168 --> 30:05.904
I look over and see Marty
flirting with Chloe,

30:05.970 --> 30:08.373
she's my friend
and I don't wanna see her hurt.

30:08.439 --> 30:10.875
I'm gonna see what he's playing at.

30:18.216 --> 30:21.886
Why the fuck is Chantelle getting
involved in other people's shit?

30:21.953 --> 30:23.354
Just keep your beak out.

30:31.696 --> 30:34.599
Marty, you say you don't like Chloe
and you've told her,

30:34.666 --> 30:37.068
why are you all over her
leading her on?

30:40.004 --> 30:43.408
As a friend, I need to tell Chloe
what he's been saying.

30:43.474 --> 30:46.711
Hopefully, she'll fuck
that little shit right off.

30:53.051 --> 30:55.820
Chantelle told us Marty
doesn't give a fuck about us.

30:55.887 --> 30:59.624
It's really pissed us off. How
would she know? I'm not listening.

31:01.960 --> 31:04.028
What has Chantelle
just said to Chloe?

31:10.001 --> 31:12.937
Chantelle's got Chloe's
best interests at heart,

31:13.004 --> 31:15.006
but if there's one thing
I've learned,

31:15.073 --> 31:18.109
don't get involved
with anyone else relationship.

31:21.145 --> 31:24.048
I've had such a good time
at this foam party,

31:24.115 --> 31:26.985
but it's time to get back
and get ready for tonight.

31:35.627 --> 31:38.529
Get back and despite
Chantelle pissing us off,

31:38.596 --> 31:41.866
I still wanna have fun
with the girls and forget about it.

31:41.933 --> 31:43.801
Dance like a radgie!

31:43.868 --> 31:45.803
Jump like a radgie!

31:45.870 --> 31:47.238
Belly flop like a radgie!

31:47.305 --> 31:50.308
(chanting) Belly flop! Belly flop!

31:54.512 --> 31:55.813
(laughter)

31:55.880 --> 31:59.183
I pure bushed out.

31:59.250 --> 32:03.087
We're drunk and I can't wait to tell
the girls me and Aaron have made up.

32:03.154 --> 32:05.623
Today, I literally
laid it all on the line.

32:05.690 --> 32:08.259
Normally, he has a way around it,
but he didn't.

32:08.326 --> 32:10.828
Get him to be boyfriend
and girlfriend? Yeah.

32:12.864 --> 32:16.267
(cheering)

32:16.334 --> 32:18.636
Thank God Marnie and Aaron
are back on track.

32:18.703 --> 32:21.372
I haven't been here
when they've been good.

32:21.439 --> 32:23.308
I'm glad to see them getting along.

32:23.374 --> 32:26.244
So, Marnie, it's quite
a sad moment for me.

32:26.311 --> 32:27.812
Does that mean we're over?

32:27.879 --> 32:31.049
He did bring it up and he said,
If you ever kiss Chloe again

32:31.115 --> 32:34.052
that is it. I'll never
try with you again."

32:34.118 --> 32:35.486
That is not cheating to me.

32:35.553 --> 32:38.056
That's like me
kissing my fucking, like, dog.

32:38.122 --> 32:41.159
I mean...
Me dog!

32:41.225 --> 32:43.695
Me dog? Is that...

32:43.761 --> 32:47.098
I can't believe Marnie
has just compared us to her dog.

32:47.165 --> 32:49.767
I paid a lot of money
for this shneck.

32:49.834 --> 32:53.404
There's one thing that Aaron
can't change, that is the friendship.

32:53.471 --> 32:55.740
Exactly.
Shall we kiss one more time?

32:55.807 --> 32:58.242
No, we're not allowed!
On the cheek.

32:59.243 --> 33:00.645
We're allowed to do that.

33:00.712 --> 33:02.814
Right. Let's go in. Come on.

33:02.880 --> 33:06.884
Today has been a great day and I'm
hoping we can carry on the vibes.

33:15.293 --> 33:17.962
I've not drank for a few nights.

33:18.029 --> 33:20.064
It's my first night out
having a drink.

33:20.131 --> 33:23.601
I know I can control myself.
You know what? I'm worried I've got,

33:23.668 --> 33:25.837
on my mind is Martin pulling a girl.

33:25.903 --> 33:29.407
If Marty does pull, I'll make sure
to point it out to Chloe.

33:29.474 --> 33:33.311
And then she'll be able to see
what kind of waste of space he is.

33:36.881 --> 33:40.084
Oh, I've got something good
going on here.

33:40.151 --> 33:42.019
Nice.

33:42.086 --> 33:43.788
Me and the lads are getting ready

33:43.855 --> 33:46.491
and I'm filling them in how
Chantelle had a pop at us

33:46.557 --> 33:49.093
about Chloe today at the foam party.

33:56.934 --> 34:00.405
Chantelle needs to learn to keep her
nose out of Marty's business,

34:00.471 --> 34:02.240
it's fuck all to do with her.

34:05.543 --> 34:07.812
Cheers everyone!

34:07.879 --> 34:09.781
(all) Cheers!

34:09.847 --> 34:13.484
We look mint, and we smell even
better. Tonight is gonna be wicked.

34:13.551 --> 34:15.553
(Chloe shouting)

34:17.121 --> 34:20.291
Fuck off, Chantelle.
What's this gotta do with you?

34:20.358 --> 34:23.494
Why's she getting involved
with other people's business?

34:24.762 --> 34:27.931
Fuck you! I don't think I can live
with these people any more.

34:27.998 --> 34:29.801
I want out of this house.

34:29.867 --> 34:32.235
(all) Geordie Shore, why aye!

34:35.005 --> 34:35.206
.

34:37.775 --> 34:40.777
'This part contains
more strong language,

34:40.844 --> 34:43.815
sex talk and scenes,
plus very aggressive behaviour.'

34:43.880 --> 34:48.386
'So if that's not your for you,
best turn over. You've been warned.'

34:52.690 --> 34:54.257
The club is bouncing.

34:54.324 --> 34:58.663
After Chantelle ruined the foam
party, I wanna have a good night.

34:58.729 --> 35:00.231
Pass the vodka.

35:05.570 --> 35:07.905
Tonight is gonna be fucking wicked.

35:16.647 --> 35:20.084
I am buzzing for tonight.
Me and Gaz are on fucking fire.

35:20.151 --> 35:23.287
I cannot wait to pull a bird.
I'm single, I can do what I want.

35:29.527 --> 35:32.997
Now I'm happily back with Marnie,
I won't be going on the pull.

35:44.075 --> 35:47.912
I'm so pleased me and Aaron are in
a good place. This is all I wanted.

35:52.517 --> 35:54.685
I know Chloe's
still hung up on Marty

35:54.752 --> 35:58.356
and with her drinking tonight,
I'm worried she's gonna kick off.

36:04.562 --> 36:07.164
If Marty does pull
and I don't kick off,

36:07.231 --> 36:10.768
then maybe he'll see I've changed
and I might get him back.

36:25.917 --> 36:29.754
I've seen a wicked bird
and I'm gonna neck on with her.

36:31.455 --> 36:33.357
What could possibly go wrong?

36:35.960 --> 36:38.329
Surprise, surprise,
Marty has pulled.

36:38.396 --> 36:42.099
I'm gonna take this opportunity
to show Chloe what he's really like.

36:42.166 --> 36:45.636
I tried to warn her earlier, she
didn't listen. Maybe now she will.

36:52.343 --> 36:53.945
Is Martin taking the piss?

36:54.011 --> 36:56.280
He's a single boy
and he can do what he wants,

36:56.347 --> 36:59.984
but when he pulls he does it right
in front of my face. That hurts.

37:07.091 --> 37:11.562
Chantelle means well, but the more
it's brought up, the more it hurts.

37:17.568 --> 37:19.570
Sorry, Chloe, but the truth hurts.

37:19.637 --> 37:23.774
That kid has never respected you from
the minute he walked in the door.

37:25.376 --> 37:28.045
Marty pulling in front of us
is bad enough,

37:28.112 --> 37:30.481
but Chantelle going on about it
is too much.

37:30.548 --> 37:32.049
I've had enough.

37:35.319 --> 37:39.991
Well, surprise, surprise, the
harmony in the group didn't last.

37:44.228 --> 37:46.631
Have I done something wrong?

37:51.869 --> 37:54.805
I look over and all I can see
is Chantelle in Chloe's ear.

37:54.872 --> 37:58.876
I've had enough of her sticking her
beak in. I'm gonna sort this out.

38:07.918 --> 38:10.921
Gary and Aaron don't like us?
How childish are you?

38:10.988 --> 38:14.158
Gary seemed to like us when he had
his tongue down my throat.

38:18.496 --> 38:21.332
I get into people's heads?
Nah, there's a difference.

38:21.399 --> 38:24.068
The thing with me,
I just tell you exactly how it is.

38:30.675 --> 38:33.444
Fuck off, Chantelle. What's this
got to do with you?

38:33.511 --> 38:35.880
I'm going to sort this out
with Chloe.

38:45.122 --> 38:47.525
Fuck off, you fucking nacker.

38:51.295 --> 38:54.165
Two minutes ago, I was necking on
with a wicked bird,

38:54.231 --> 38:57.702
now I'm getting
swilled off Chantelle.

38:57.768 --> 39:00.304
Why is Chantelle swilling Marty?

39:00.371 --> 39:03.374
Why's she getting involved?
Keep your nose out.

39:08.479 --> 39:11.015
It sounds to me like everybody
is talking shit.

39:11.082 --> 39:14.051
So when we get back,
let's lay it out on the table.

39:16.787 --> 39:19.156
It's gone west.
Chantelle's swilled Marty,

39:19.223 --> 39:21.926
everything's gone to pot.
Let's just get home.

39:33.370 --> 39:35.773
Chantelle's just walked in.
Here we go.

39:35.840 --> 39:38.442
Get the food on the table,
have a nice meal.

39:38.509 --> 39:40.578
Let's talk about what's been said.

39:40.644 --> 39:42.980
Who stirred shit up?
Let's talk about it.

39:43.047 --> 39:44.782
So let's fucking talk about it.

39:44.849 --> 39:47.585
I say to you, you've never
liked her. Did I say that?

39:47.651 --> 39:49.019
I used to like her.

39:49.086 --> 39:52.356
If you don't like her, why's it
a problem for me to say you don't?

39:52.423 --> 39:53.691
It's nowt to do with you.

39:53.758 --> 39:56.026
Marty is accusing me
of being a stirrer.

39:56.093 --> 40:00.264
I did tell Chloe he didn't like her,
I was being a good friend.

40:00.331 --> 40:02.299
I'm sick of her looking like a mug.

40:02.366 --> 40:05.169
Did I have your back? Did I say
that he didn't like you?

40:06.303 --> 40:08.506
I can't remember.
You don't remember?

40:08.572 --> 40:11.408
Well, try and remember.
Try and remember cos...

40:11.475 --> 40:13.477
I mean, I can't remember,
to be honest.

40:13.544 --> 40:14.612
I'm staying quiet.

40:14.678 --> 40:17.414
I'm sick of Chantelle
saying Marty doesn't like us.

40:17.481 --> 40:19.784
She's always sticking her nose in.

40:19.850 --> 40:21.519
Mind your own business.

40:21.585 --> 40:24.588
I don't remember.
I don't remember at all. I don't.

40:24.655 --> 40:27.324
Oh, my days. I can't believe this.

40:27.391 --> 40:31.095
I thought we were friends. When it
comes to Marty I've had your back,

40:31.162 --> 40:33.063
so why aren't you
sticking up for me?

40:33.130 --> 40:36.700
I'm not the only person
that says this shit that I say.

40:36.767 --> 40:40.237
Chantelle, stop trying to drag
every person into your arguments.

40:40.304 --> 40:42.940
If you can get involved
in people's shit, so can I.

40:43.007 --> 40:45.242
Let's talk about this.
You don't like me.

40:45.309 --> 40:48.746
You don't like me.
I don't like you? I don't like you?

40:48.813 --> 40:52.783
You know what I don't like? You
get involved where it's not wanted.

40:52.850 --> 40:53.851
I'm sick of it.

40:53.918 --> 40:56.287
What reason have you got
not to like me?

40:56.353 --> 40:59.757
Fuck off.
Boring, boring, boring, boring.

40:59.824 --> 41:03.894
Gary needs to stay out of this. This
is Marty and Chantelle's argument.

41:03.961 --> 41:07.064
Why's he getting involved?
You're boring. You bore us.

41:08.766 --> 41:11.669
You fuck... Fuck you!

41:11.735 --> 41:15.406
Gary, you wanker. Who do you think
you are to speak to me like that?

41:15.472 --> 41:18.409
(indistinct)
Go in on me like that...

41:18.475 --> 41:21.045
Why would you be so nasty?

41:21.111 --> 41:23.180
Why's it bothering you so much?

41:23.247 --> 41:25.282
Have I went in on you?
Have I been nasty?

41:25.349 --> 41:28.085
I'm telling you...
Have I been nasty to you?

41:28.152 --> 41:30.321
What really hurts
is Chloe betraying us.

41:30.387 --> 41:32.489
I actually thought we were friends.

41:32.556 --> 41:34.925
I'm foaming.
I'm foaming with you, Chloe.

41:34.992 --> 41:36.894
I'm foaming with you, Chloe.

41:36.961 --> 41:39.363
Two-faced cunts in this house.

41:39.430 --> 41:40.931
I want out the house.

41:40.998 --> 41:42.733
I want out of this house.

41:42.800 --> 41:47.571
I know Chloe didn't back her up, but
I can't believe she wants to leave.

41:47.638 --> 41:51.508
She hasn't been herself lately.
I guess this is the final straw.

41:51.575 --> 41:55.012
I'm foaming, cos there's one thing
I'm not, two-faced.

41:55.079 --> 41:59.416
I've seen a lot of true colours.
I can't live with these people.

41:59.483 --> 42:01.752
Get me the fuck
away from this villa.

42:05.089 --> 42:09.226
While there's a break in screaming,
me and the boys are going to bed.

42:10.327 --> 42:12.162
I don't want you to go, Chantelle.

42:12.229 --> 42:14.565
I cannot stay in this house.

42:14.632 --> 42:16.867
I feel totally betrayed by Chloe

42:16.934 --> 42:19.770
and devastated
she stabbed us in the back.

42:20.638 --> 42:22.740
I'm going.

42:22.806 --> 42:25.309
I can not live with that girl
any more.

42:33.751 --> 42:36.453
Tonight's been intense.
Chantelle's gone home.

42:36.520 --> 42:41.425
But I'm not gonna let anything ruin
mine and Aaron's first night back.

42:41.492 --> 42:43.961
I'm getting myself some sexy time.

42:52.770 --> 42:55.372
To be honest,
I never felt like I fit in.

42:55.439 --> 42:58.709
This is the end of
the Geordie Shore family for me.

42:58.776 --> 43:00.244
It's time for us to go.

43:08.585 --> 43:11.088
Today is gonna be a good day.

43:11.155 --> 43:13.090
Everybody is fucking mortal.

43:13.157 --> 43:15.859
(chanting) Nathan is a mess.

43:15.926 --> 43:17.361
Ayia-fucking-napa.

43:17.428 --> 43:19.029
(chanting) Napa! Napa! Napa!

43:19.096 --> 43:21.298

43:37.114 --> 43:39.583
This is actually quite serious.
