WEBVTT

00:24.899 --> 00:27.193
So that's the plan,
my love. Okay?

00:27.277 --> 00:28.403
Okay, Mommy.

00:29.112 --> 00:30.113
Okay. [sighs]

00:31.990 --> 00:34.075
Stop! That's not how that goes.

00:34.159 --> 00:36.161
Sorry. Sorry, I forgot.

00:38.371 --> 00:40.540
Amistad, come on.
We've got to go.

00:40.623 --> 00:41.583
Wait.

00:45.712 --> 00:47.338
I want
a black-and-white cookie.

00:47.422 --> 00:50.717
You just had breakfast.
It's time to go see Daddy.

00:50.800 --> 00:51.885
Wool hat.

00:51.968 --> 00:53.636
It's August.
You don't need a hat.

00:53.720 --> 00:55.346
You'll be too warm in that hat.

00:55.430 --> 00:57.807
I can't go to Daddy
without my wool hat.
[straining]

00:57.891 --> 01:00.226
Fine.
We'll look for the hat.

01:02.395 --> 01:05.231
No hat. No hat.

01:07.692 --> 01:10.153
No hat. No hat.

01:11.321 --> 01:12.572
Sorry, baby,
I couldn't find it,

01:12.655 --> 01:14.699
but Daddy can
get you a new hat.

01:14.783 --> 01:15.992
No!

01:16.826 --> 01:18.953
No! No, no, no!

01:19.037 --> 01:21.748
-[grunting angrily]
-How about that
black-and-white cookie?

01:22.665 --> 01:24.042
-Okay.
-Okay.

01:25.585 --> 01:27.670
[gasps]

01:27.754 --> 01:31.216
-Wool hat!
-No, Amistad. That's final.

01:33.218 --> 01:34.135
[grunts]

01:34.219 --> 01:36.262
[hyperventilating]

01:39.015 --> 01:40.183
[screaming]

01:45.438 --> 01:47.607
Mmm. [sniffing]

01:50.401 --> 01:51.528
Mmm.

01:53.863 --> 01:54.989
She smells bad.

01:55.073 --> 01:56.658
Excuse me, young man?

01:56.741 --> 01:58.201
I am so sorry.

01:58.284 --> 02:00.119
He's very sensitive
to perfumes.

02:00.203 --> 02:01.788
He didn't mean it
the way it sounded.

02:01.871 --> 02:04.374
I did mean it.
She does smell bad.

02:04.457 --> 02:06.543
You can't just say
that kind of thing.
It's not polite.

02:06.626 --> 02:09.212
It's not polite
for her to smell bad.

02:09.295 --> 02:11.214
Your boy needs to learn
some manners.

02:11.297 --> 02:14.008
Do not tell me
what my son needs.

02:14.092 --> 02:15.301
[scoffs]

02:16.803 --> 02:18.388
Sixteenth Avenue is next.

02:18.471 --> 02:20.515
We have to get off
at Seventeenth today.

02:20.598 --> 02:23.226
We always get off
at Sixteenth Avenue
to go to Daddy's.

02:23.309 --> 02:25.436
The train won't stop there
today. The station's closed
for construction.

02:25.520 --> 02:27.647
-We always get off at
Sixteenth Avenue...
-[P.A. system chiming]

02:27.730 --> 02:30.108
-to go to Daddy's.
-[P.A.]<i> Next stop,</i>
<i>Seventeenth Avenue.</i>

02:31.484 --> 02:33.152
[screaming]

02:34.529 --> 02:36.155
[sighs] Uh, we need to talk.

02:36.239 --> 02:40.201
Hey, little man.
Now, go inside.
I left your cars out.

02:40.285 --> 02:42.120
-Wheels up?
-You know it.

02:44.122 --> 02:45.915
-Hard morning?
-It was fine.

02:45.999 --> 02:47.167
You have
the Justice League codes

02:47.250 --> 02:48.251
to reach me
if there's a problem?

02:48.334 --> 02:49.711
Uh, about that.

02:49.794 --> 02:52.130
We've got Amistad's
school conference next week

02:52.213 --> 02:53.298
to go over his IEP.

02:53.381 --> 02:54.924
Can we just stop
with the acronyms?

02:55.008 --> 02:56.676
And no,
I won't be back in time,

02:56.759 --> 02:58.094
but I don't see
the need for that,

02:58.177 --> 02:59.762
and it's pointless anyway.

02:59.846 --> 03:01.264
They just don't get him
at that school.

03:01.347 --> 03:04.017
They don't understand
how intelligent he is.

03:04.100 --> 03:06.686
No one's denying
he's intelligent, Raquel,

03:06.769 --> 03:08.646
but that doesn't
change the fact that
the specialists

03:08.730 --> 03:10.481
have diagnosed him
with autism.

03:10.565 --> 03:13.318
He has outbursts in class
that his teachers can't handle.

03:13.401 --> 03:15.945
Not while trying to wrangle
20 other kids.

03:16.029 --> 03:18.281
We have to face this,
deal with it,

03:18.364 --> 03:19.449
and get him the help he needs.

03:19.532 --> 03:21.367
Not today. I'm already late.

03:23.912 --> 03:25.163
Bye, my baby. I love you.

03:25.246 --> 03:27.081
[kisses] I'll be home soon.

03:37.008 --> 03:37.842
[sighs]

03:41.304 --> 03:43.389
[theme music playing]

04:20.009 --> 04:21.094
[Flash] Lost in space?

04:21.177 --> 04:23.513
Hmm? No, we're right on course.

04:23.596 --> 04:25.473
[chuckles] I can see that.

04:27.475 --> 04:31.688
And frankly, after being
cooped up on the<i> Javelin</i>
for two days,

04:31.771 --> 04:34.565
I'm ready to stretch my legs.

04:34.649 --> 04:37.026
Is Flash ready to stretch
Flash's legs

04:37.110 --> 04:39.696
for Flash's first mission
as a Justice Leaguer?

04:39.779 --> 04:42.407
Yes. Nice being
the new kid for a change.

04:42.490 --> 04:46.411
Oh, Forager can see Forager's
old Forest Hive from here.

04:46.494 --> 04:49.205
Well, you'll have to
give me a tour
when we get down there.

04:49.288 --> 04:50.790
[Rocket] This isn't
a pleasure cruise.

04:50.873 --> 04:53.209
We're here to represent Earth
at the Summit,

04:53.293 --> 04:55.044
get a treaty signed if we can.

04:55.128 --> 05:00.258
Well yeah. Justice League
meets the New Gods meets
the Green Lantern Corps.

05:00.341 --> 05:03.761
Big old Hero Summit.
A sure-fire hoot.

05:03.845 --> 05:05.513
-Hoot?
-You heard me.

05:05.596 --> 05:08.725
Any last minute advice
on navigating New Genesis?

05:08.808 --> 05:11.394
Forager is unsure
what to tell Rocket.

05:11.477 --> 05:14.814
Forager has not been to
Forager's home world
in over a year.

05:14.897 --> 05:17.608
And Forager has never been
to Supertown before.

05:17.692 --> 05:20.653
Forager is unsure
how useful Forager will be.

05:20.737 --> 05:21.988
[alert buzz]

05:22.071 --> 05:24.782
<i>Nos Kemnos, Kagenna Danjar...</i>

[grunts]

05:26.034 --> 05:27.785
[Motherbox pings]

05:27.869 --> 05:30.913
[in English] The New Gods
welcome the Justice League
to New Genesis.

05:30.997 --> 05:32.206
[Rocket] Thank you.

05:32.290 --> 05:34.917
Technically, Forager
is an Outsider.

05:35.001 --> 05:36.586
Ready to receive
landing coordinates.

05:36.669 --> 05:39.088
Coordinates will not
be necessary.

05:39.172 --> 05:40.590
Simply follow the Lightray.

06:21.089 --> 06:22.632
Welcome, honored guests.

06:22.715 --> 06:25.051
I am Solis, called Lightray.

06:25.134 --> 06:28.387
Allow me to introduce
Highfather Iyaza the Inheritor,

06:28.471 --> 06:30.515
Highmother Avia
the Wisdom-Bringer,

06:30.598 --> 06:34.060
and their son Orion,
Dog of War.

06:34.143 --> 06:36.312
Dog of War?

06:44.654 --> 06:46.239
What brings you today,
Antinoos?

06:46.322 --> 06:48.908
Another delivery of
drained crystals,
Captain Celestia.

06:52.078 --> 06:52.995
Enter.

07:03.714 --> 07:08.052
Forager is honored
to meet Highfather.

07:08.136 --> 07:10.346
Welcome to Supertown.

07:10.429 --> 07:13.141
The first Bug
to be so welcomed,

07:13.224 --> 07:17.145
and... [clears throat]
high time, too.

07:29.115 --> 07:32.243
[curious chittering]

07:38.166 --> 07:42.003
[Orion] The representatives
from the Green Lantern Corps
will arrive tomorrow.

07:42.086 --> 07:45.047
In the meantime,
I will escort you
to your quarters.

07:45.131 --> 07:46.424
[Motherbox pings]

07:49.260 --> 07:50.678
This is unknown technology.

07:50.761 --> 07:53.139
It should be confiscated
for study.

07:53.222 --> 07:56.976
Kid, you're going to want to
rethink that policy.

07:57.059 --> 08:00.897
My son, Rocket is
our honored guest.

08:00.980 --> 08:04.692
[grunts] Fine,
request withdrawn.

08:10.990 --> 08:12.658
-[both grunting]
-[Celestia] Excuse me, I...

08:12.742 --> 08:14.368
A Bug?

08:14.452 --> 08:15.328
[Celestia grunts]

08:15.411 --> 08:16.996
[Motherbox pings]

08:17.079 --> 08:18.414
How unusual.

08:18.497 --> 08:21.250
A thief has broken into
our secured warehouse.

08:35.139 --> 08:37.308
[Graggin]
Hunger Dogs, hear me.

08:37.391 --> 08:39.936
We outnumber the New Gods
on Apokolips

08:40.019 --> 08:41.395
a thousand to one.

08:41.479 --> 08:43.147
If we all rose up together,

08:43.231 --> 08:45.274
we could even
overthrow Darksei--

08:45.358 --> 08:46.984
Don't you say it, Graggin.

08:47.068 --> 08:50.571
You'll get us all killed,
or worse, reeducated.

08:50.655 --> 08:54.408
Now shut up, get down
and get out of my bar!

08:54.492 --> 08:57.245
[indistinct chatter]

09:03.501 --> 09:05.503
You really believe all that?

09:05.586 --> 09:07.964
It's simple math.
Of course, I do.

09:08.047 --> 09:10.424
No one ever taught me math
before now.

09:14.470 --> 09:17.014
Come with me. There are others
you should meet.

09:22.270 --> 09:25.356
-[Rocket] I can help.
-That's not protocol.

09:25.439 --> 09:27.149
Come on.

09:27.233 --> 09:29.151
It'll give you a chance to see
my unknown technology
in action.

09:29.235 --> 09:31.153
My priorities do not include--

09:31.237 --> 09:32.238
[Highmother clears throat]

09:34.448 --> 09:37.451
[grunts] Help
would be appreciated.

09:38.995 --> 09:41.122
[Motherbox pings]

09:49.380 --> 09:50.548
No!

09:55.803 --> 09:57.430
Impressive.

09:57.513 --> 09:59.682
To time one's descent
with Supertown's trajectory
and speed

09:59.765 --> 10:02.601
in order to drop into the lake
below required calculation

10:02.685 --> 10:04.228
worthy of Motherbox.

10:06.439 --> 10:08.024
[Motherbox pings]

10:08.107 --> 10:10.901
[grunts] The environment
has been charged
with Radion particles.

10:10.985 --> 10:12.570
Motherbox cannot track
the thief.

10:12.653 --> 10:14.488
Then we'll take
the direct approach.

10:19.076 --> 10:21.245
[gasps, groans]

10:21.329 --> 10:23.414
-Let me out.
-Underwater?

10:23.497 --> 10:26.125
Let me out... now!

10:28.919 --> 10:31.005
[Motherbox pings repeatedly]

10:31.088 --> 10:33.132
-[Orion panting]
-You all right?

10:34.091 --> 10:37.845
Fine. I am fine.

10:37.928 --> 10:40.431
Great, 'cause the thief
got away.

10:43.976 --> 10:44.852
[Superboy grunts]

10:48.189 --> 10:49.690
Who are you?

10:49.774 --> 10:52.860
I am the Superboy. [grunts]

10:57.990 --> 10:59.241
Who are you?

10:59.325 --> 11:01.911
A genomorph. [grunts]

11:06.123 --> 11:07.249
Who are you?

11:07.333 --> 11:09.710
A clone made from
the DNA of the Superman.

11:09.794 --> 11:11.003
-Why?
-[Superboy grunts]

11:11.087 --> 11:13.172
To replace Superman
should he perish.

11:13.255 --> 11:15.883
To destroy him
should he turn from the light.

11:15.966 --> 11:17.093
[Superboy grunts]

11:17.176 --> 11:19.220
That's right, my boy.
Very good.

11:19.303 --> 11:20.638
Thank you, Father.

11:28.646 --> 11:30.606
A capable female.

11:30.689 --> 11:32.191
How do you know she's female?

11:32.274 --> 11:33.859
Is not
the Bug's gender obvious?

11:33.943 --> 11:36.070
[Lightray] Why is a Bug
privy to this meeting?

11:36.153 --> 11:37.571
[Forager groans]

11:37.655 --> 11:40.116
[Orion] This is not the Bug
that committed the crime.

11:40.199 --> 11:42.993
And this Bug may be able to
help us catch that Bug.

11:43.077 --> 11:46.122
Do we know
what exactly was stolen?

11:46.205 --> 11:48.165
A Radion-powered Ruction Cell.

11:48.249 --> 11:49.750
It must be ancient.

11:49.834 --> 11:52.586
Five or six thousand years old
at least.

11:52.670 --> 11:54.463
No wonder it was warehoused.

11:54.547 --> 11:56.507
It's both obsolete
and dangerous.

11:56.590 --> 11:58.175
[Flash] Does the other Bug
know that?

11:58.259 --> 11:59.635
[Highmother] I think not.

11:59.718 --> 12:02.388
We must retrieve this Cell
before someone gets hurt.

12:02.471 --> 12:04.640
We must search the hive
near the lake.

12:04.723 --> 12:06.892
No. Notice the Bug's markings.

12:06.976 --> 12:08.936
This Bug is
of the mountain hive.

12:09.019 --> 12:10.980
Mmm, I thought
you might be useful.

12:11.063 --> 12:13.232
We can all be useful.

12:16.068 --> 12:17.570
[Jovita] What is this place?

12:17.653 --> 12:20.030
The last stop
for the Resistance.

12:20.114 --> 12:21.991
[Parademon roars]

12:22.074 --> 12:23.284
Parademons.

[gasps, grunts,
screams in pain]

12:28.747 --> 12:31.667
[Ma'alefa'ak] Another rebel
against Lord Darkseid.

12:31.750 --> 12:36.380
Rebel? I never thought
of rebelling
until I heard you speak.

12:36.464 --> 12:38.174
Mmm.
But you were susceptible.

12:38.257 --> 12:41.177
Take this traitor
to the reeducation center.

12:41.260 --> 12:43.220
No. No!

12:43.304 --> 12:46.557
Very good, Ma'alefa'ak.

12:46.640 --> 12:49.477
That's the sixteenth traitor
you've arrested.

12:49.560 --> 12:52.980
My father is pleased and
summons you for an audience.

12:53.063 --> 12:54.648

[Mountain Forager] If Hive can
harness this device, Hive can
bring power to entire Mountain.

13:09.663 --> 13:14.001

[Forager] Stay here.

13:24.136 --> 13:25.679
But Forager--

13:25.763 --> 13:29.600
Forager trusts Larvae
will keep this
great prize safe.

13:29.683 --> 13:32.269
Yes, Larvae will!

13:32.353 --> 13:33.604
[pings]

13:33.687 --> 13:35.731
[Orion]
Motherbox is Radion-blocked.

13:35.814 --> 13:37.900
The Ruction Cell
must be in the vicinity.

13:37.983 --> 13:41.654
[Rocket] Don't suppose
Motherbox is blocked
in any particular direction?

13:41.737 --> 13:44.031
I could check all those
tunnels pretty quick.

13:44.114 --> 13:46.242
Not Barry-Allen-quick,
but still...

13:46.325 --> 13:48.077
"Barry Allen"
does not translate,

13:48.160 --> 13:50.204
yet I get the gist
and I am with you.

13:50.287 --> 13:55.042
No. Highfather has
a rule against entering
Bug Hives without permission.

13:55.125 --> 13:58.254
A wise rule indeed.
[clicking]

13:58.337 --> 14:02.925
Bugs of the Mountain Hive,
Orion has come to retrieve
the Ruction Cell

14:03.008 --> 14:05.052
stolen from the New Gods.

14:05.135 --> 14:07.930
Bugs know not of
any Ruction Cell.

14:08.013 --> 14:10.683
-[Forager-1] Ruction Cell?
-[Forager-2] What's a
Ruction Cell?

14:10.766 --> 14:14.478
[Forager-3] Can Bugs eat
Ruction Cell?

14:14.562 --> 14:16.814
[Orion] There is no point
in feigning ignorance.

14:16.897 --> 14:20.693
We know one of this
Hive's Foragers stole
our property.

14:20.776 --> 14:24.905
[All-Widow] But do not all
Foragers look alike to
New Gods?

14:24.989 --> 14:29.827
How can New Gods know
that a Forager
of the Mountain Hive

14:29.910 --> 14:33.247
stole the New God's
important Cell.

14:33.330 --> 14:35.541
Hello. Forager is Forager.

14:35.624 --> 14:37.501
Hello, Forager.

14:37.585 --> 14:39.628
Forager is also Forager.

14:39.712 --> 14:42.339
Please listen.
Your safety is at risk.

14:42.423 --> 14:46.051
-[Rocket] The Ruction Cell--
-New Gods always
believe New God technology

14:46.135 --> 14:48.012
is too advanced for Bugs.

14:48.095 --> 14:51.974
And yet Forager's friend
Rocket speaks the truth
about the Ruction Cell.

14:52.057 --> 14:58.188
If Forager did forage Cell,
then Cell is Forager's.
Or has Forager spent so much

14:58.272 --> 15:02.818
time with New Gods,
Forager has forgotten
what it means to forage.

15:02.901 --> 15:05.070
Forager rolls with
Forager's Hive.

15:05.154 --> 15:07.072
Forager assumes
Forager does the same.

15:07.156 --> 15:11.493
But if Cell explodes,
Forager will have no Hive.
No Elders.

15:11.577 --> 15:14.538
No Foragers.
No Larvae to roll with.

15:14.622 --> 15:19.126
Highfather has
a rule against entering
Bug Hives without permission.

15:19.209 --> 15:21.879
But an exception can be made
to protect life.

15:21.962 --> 15:29.178
[All- Widow] If New Gods even
break faith with New God rules,
Bugs will defend Hive!

15:29.261 --> 15:32.598
Forager will bring New Gods
to the Cell.

15:32.681 --> 15:33.766
He will?

15:33.849 --> 15:35.225
Forager will not.

15:35.309 --> 15:36.769
But Forager will.

15:36.852 --> 15:39.188
No, this isn't going to get
confusing at all.

15:39.271 --> 15:41.315
[Mountain Forager] Come.

15:41.398 --> 15:43.817
Forager will be
pleased with Larvae

15:43.901 --> 15:45.611
for protecting Hive's
new prize!

15:45.694 --> 15:48.364
Larvae are much like Forager!
[clicking]

15:50.115 --> 15:52.159
[electricity crackling]

15:53.118 --> 15:55.829
Up in the sky, it's Superman!

15:55.913 --> 15:58.624
[crowd cheering]

16:05.297 --> 16:07.007
Excellent work.

16:07.091 --> 16:11.929
Always good to see
our new Superman
doing the occasional rescue.

16:12.012 --> 16:17.184
Like this Tower,
it provides the
appropriate symbolism.

16:17.267 --> 16:21.313
Keeps the mob cheering
now that the old Superman

16:21.397 --> 16:23.649
and his crimes are
all but forgotten.

16:23.732 --> 16:25.818
Is this
a job for Superman?

16:25.901 --> 16:27.027
[Lex] No.

16:27.111 --> 16:29.780
Toyman's just doing us
a small favor.

16:29.863 --> 16:33.701
We need to save our boy
for more important tasks.

16:33.784 --> 16:37.037
<i>As when he dispatched</i>
<i>that untrustworthy vigilante.</i>

16:37.121 --> 16:41.041
<i>Or when he dismantled that</i>
<i>orbiting threat to all mankind.</i>

16:41.125 --> 16:44.378
<i>These are the things</i>
<i>he excels at.</i>

16:44.461 --> 16:47.297
And you are excelling, my son.

16:47.381 --> 16:50.884
But you've yet to reach
your full potential.

16:50.968 --> 16:52.594
You know what you must do?

16:52.678 --> 16:54.555
No, Father.

16:54.638 --> 16:56.724
She's slowing you down, son.

16:58.642 --> 17:02.271
-But--
-To survive, you must
shed useless attachments.

17:02.354 --> 17:05.566
Clean your slate.
Time to let her go.

17:09.111 --> 17:13.782
[Mountain Forager] Many exits
emerge from the Hive. Larvae
could have taken any one,

17:13.866 --> 17:17.619
making Larvae's current
trajectory hard to predict.

17:17.703 --> 17:18.954
I'll run a search pattern.

17:19.038 --> 17:21.165
Good idea. I'll fly one.

17:21.248 --> 17:26.670
Around Forest Hive, Larvae
favor common Larvae trails.
Where would Mountain Larvae go?

17:26.754 --> 17:28.005
[clicking]
Follow Forager.

17:33.469 --> 17:34.803
[Ma'alefa'ak] Lord Darkseid.

17:34.887 --> 17:37.014
I have done all I was
tasked with.

17:37.097 --> 17:40.976
Having proven my worth,
I ask you to fulfill
your promise.

17:41.059 --> 17:46.148
Darkseid is neither amused
nor impressed with
Ma'alefa'ak's impudence.

17:46.231 --> 17:53.113
But complete one final task
for your Dread Lord, and you
shall be granted your boon.

17:54.364 --> 17:56.992
I await Darkseid's command.

17:57.076 --> 18:00.537
Mantis, approach
with the Kaizer-Thrall.

18:04.833 --> 18:06.627
I assume you observe.

18:06.710 --> 18:08.378
Show yourself.

18:16.845 --> 18:20.224
Uhm, what is it you want
me to do?

18:20.307 --> 18:24.061
Darkseid instructs both Mantis
and Ma'alefa'ak

18:24.144 --> 18:29.858
to follow this one's orders
as if they were Darkseid's own.

18:34.738 --> 18:36.907
[Ma'alefa'ak]
I know Mantis.

18:36.990 --> 18:38.116
Who are you?

18:39.993 --> 18:43.038
I am Lor. Lor-Zod.

18:50.838 --> 18:52.923
[crackling, beeping rapidly]

18:53.006 --> 18:55.425
-Ooh!
-What did Larva do?

18:55.509 --> 18:57.386
Larva did nothing!
Larva swears.

19:02.641 --> 19:05.144
[both laugh, cheer]

19:07.855 --> 19:09.481
[beeping rapidly]

19:11.984 --> 19:13.026
[both gasp]

19:15.863 --> 19:18.574
[Larvae laughing]

19:18.657 --> 19:21.869
Stop what you're doing
and return the Ruction Cell
to me.

19:21.952 --> 19:24.538
New Gods have found Larvae
and will take Forager's gift!

19:24.621 --> 19:25.706
-[electricity crackling]
-[screams]

19:25.789 --> 19:26.874
[Orion grunts]

19:27.583 --> 19:30.252
[screams]

19:30.335 --> 19:34.339
Larvae, stop!
That device is dangerous
to Larvae and the Hive.

19:34.423 --> 19:35.757
[both screaming]

19:35.841 --> 19:38.468
Drop it and run! I'll put
a Force-Bubble around it!

19:38.552 --> 19:39.720
[angry roar]

19:43.515 --> 19:47.853
This is New God honor?
Violence against Larvae?

19:47.936 --> 19:51.899
Ugh, I don't know how long
we have. My tech won't bottle
that type of energy long.

19:51.982 --> 19:54.109
[screams, grunts]

19:57.863 --> 20:00.324
[screaming]

20:03.660 --> 20:05.454
Flash, get those kids
to safety!

20:05.537 --> 20:06.914
Roger that!

20:06.997 --> 20:09.458
-Rocket, release him!
-Are you serious?

20:09.541 --> 20:11.293
Look at him!

20:11.376 --> 20:13.045
Please, he's claustrophobic.

20:13.128 --> 20:15.756
You must release him
before you do
irreparable damage.

20:18.508 --> 20:20.218
[all grunt]

20:21.345 --> 20:22.888
[screaming]

20:22.971 --> 20:26.433
-[Lightray grunts]
-[Motherbox pings]

20:26.516 --> 20:28.268
[panting]

20:37.277 --> 20:38.612
[sighs]

20:41.073 --> 20:42.032
Apologies.

20:49.039 --> 20:52.167
[Flash] It seems the
Ruction Cell is dormant now
but still dangerous.

20:52.250 --> 20:55.504
Metron, over there,
is supposed to take it to his
"Inter-Dimensional Vault"

20:55.587 --> 20:56.922
-for safekeeping.
-[Mobius Chair gongs]

21:01.259 --> 21:03.261
[Orion] I lost control again.

21:03.345 --> 21:07.557
Another inheritance
from my biological father.

21:07.641 --> 21:10.394
You are not him
and never will be.

21:11.311 --> 21:12.479
[Rocket sighs]

21:12.562 --> 21:14.314
[Flash] By the way, kid,
good job.

21:14.398 --> 21:17.025
Without your insight,
we never would have found
the Cell in time.

21:17.109 --> 21:18.777
You both did great.

21:18.860 --> 21:22.364
I wish I had done as well.
I totally froze up
in the clutch.

21:22.447 --> 21:24.324
Don't be so hard on yourself.

21:24.408 --> 21:26.034
Everyone's safe after all.

21:26.118 --> 21:27.536
That doesn't cut it.

21:27.619 --> 21:30.163
I've got to lead
negotiations tomorrow...

21:30.247 --> 21:32.582
And I'll be negotiating
with a monster.

21:37.045 --> 21:40.132
It's time to shed
this last burden.

21:42.009 --> 21:44.136
I just don't know.

21:44.219 --> 21:46.555
[Unknown voice]
What don't you know?

21:46.638 --> 21:50.392
Talking to yourself
or someone else?

21:50.475 --> 21:51.893
I'm guessing the latter.

21:51.977 --> 21:54.271
Which means you're suffering
from Zone-Sickness.

21:54.354 --> 21:56.982
Hallucinating. We all
go through it.

21:57.065 --> 21:59.651
How do I know
you're not a hallucination?

21:59.735 --> 22:02.946
Because we've never
seen each other before.

22:03.030 --> 22:05.991
At any rate, I don't recall
ever seeing you.

22:06.825 --> 22:08.160
Do I look familiar?

22:08.744 --> 22:10.579
No.

22:10.662 --> 22:13.832
Well, that's because I'm real.
Or as real as anything gets
around here.

22:13.915 --> 22:18.253
I'm real. You're real.
And that girl
you're carrying is real.

22:20.505 --> 22:24.342
Anyone else is just
the sickness talking.

22:24.426 --> 22:27.763
I can teach you
how to survive, um...

22:27.846 --> 22:29.514
I am the Superboy.

22:31.016 --> 22:32.851
If you say so.

22:32.934 --> 22:39.649
My name's Dru, by the way,
Dru-Zod. General Dru-Zod.

22:51.369 --> 22:52.704
[Superman]
Every candidate up here
would make a fine recruit

22:52.788 --> 22:54.623
into our new
Justice League reserves.

22:54.706 --> 22:56.917
Oh, and I couldn't find
any clear pictures of them,

22:57.000 --> 22:59.795
but the recruitment committee
should also consider
Peacemaker,

22:59.878 --> 23:02.631
Etrigan the Demon
and the Phantom Stranger.

23:02.714 --> 23:06.468
Plus, in a real planetary
crisis, Russia has more
Rocket Reds,

23:06.551 --> 23:11.181
and China has, well,
whatever it is they're not
telling us they have.

23:11.264 --> 23:13.141
Orin and Diana have
both indicated

23:13.225 --> 23:17.395
that Atlantis and the
Themyscira are potential
untapped resources, too.

23:17.479 --> 23:20.148
We've barely scratched
the surface in either kingdom.

23:20.232 --> 23:22.400
Same for Geranium City,
perhaps.

23:22.484 --> 23:26.404
We also want to create
cooperative plans of action
with Mars and maybe Thanagar.

23:26.488 --> 23:32.160
And if Rocket's negotiations go
as hoped with New Genesis
and Oa as well.

23:32.244 --> 23:34.246
The real question is Markovia.

23:34.329 --> 23:37.415
There are heroes there,
but can we be certain Geo-Force

23:37.499 --> 23:40.919
and his Infinitors
will abide by Justice League
standards?

23:41.002 --> 23:44.005
Last thing we want or need
is for a reserve mission

23:44.089 --> 23:47.425
to cost us the trust
we've worked so hard to build.
