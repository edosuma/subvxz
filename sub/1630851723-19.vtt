Ms. Nemec's family

12:46.366 --> 12:48.701

you and your superiors

12:48.836 --> 12:51.204

their civil rights.

12:51.338 --> 12:53.540
Now, Ms. Nemec's family
have instructed me

12:53.673 --> 12:56.276

from filing the suit,

Thank you, Vlad.

35:46.512 --> 35:48.146
Adios.
Adios.

(SOFT MUSIC PLAYING)

35:54.386 --> 35:57.456
Raymond, go.

35:58.724 --> 36:00.158
Do what you will.

36:15.106 --> 36:15.841
(DOOR SHUTS)

36:19.311 --> 36:21.747
So, that's not normal?

36:21.880 --> 36:26.618
It's not uncommon for patients
to encounter feelings of shame

36:26.752 --> 36:30.456
and grief or even experience
radical confrontations

36:30.589 --> 36:32.991
with the self, but...
Murder loops?

36:33.124 --> 36:35.227
Not something
I've heard before.

36:35.361 --> 36:36.662
I'm not sure I'd put it
in the brochure.

36:38.330 --> 36:39.631
How do you feel?

36:40.499 --> 36:42.200
(SIGHS) I don't know.

36:42.734 --> 36:44.135
Um...

36:44.270 --> 36:46.938
It's like I was certain that
it was just a matter of time

36:47.072 --> 36:49.007
before everything
fell apart,

36:49.140 --> 36:51.042
and so I fought as hard
as I could to stop it,

36:51.176 --> 36:52.611
even though
I knew I couldn't.

36:52.744 --> 36:53.712
And now,

36:55.113 --> 36:57.649
for the first time
that I can remember...

37:01.687 --> 37:03.355
...I don't feel like
I have to fight anymore.

37:04.790 --> 37:07.259
I'm glad, Aram.

37:07.393 --> 37:10.962
It's not uncommon to feel like
one has a new lease on life...

37:11.096 --> 37:12.498
But?

37:12.631 --> 37:14.666
This treatment
isn't a cure-all.

37:15.367 --> 37:17.469
Do you understand?

37:17.603 --> 37:18.737
I understand
about as much

37:18.870 --> 37:20.972
as anything that happened
to me today.

37:21.106 --> 37:23.809
So, 50%?

37:23.942 --> 37:25.210
(CHUCKLES)

37:25.344 --> 37:26.745
Good enough.

37:33.018 --> 37:36.688
(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)

37:36.822 --> 37:40.025
That night,
before the explosion...

37:40.158 --> 37:42.193
(******)

37:42.328 --> 37:44.195
...I was wondering
what I would do

37:44.330 --> 37:48.534
if all this
really was Kate's doing.

37:49.768 --> 37:52.003
I remember knowing
with absolute certainty

37:52.137 --> 37:55.607
that Elizabeth would have
wanted me to show her mercy.

37:59.678 --> 38:01.146
I can still hear her voice.

38:03.114 --> 38:04.583
Me, too.

38:07.118 --> 38:09.254
Before the bomb went off,

38:09.388 --> 38:11.156
I thought maybe...

38:13.925 --> 38:16.094
...I just might rise
to the occasion.

38:18.063 --> 38:19.531
At least now we know

38:19.665 --> 38:22.401
Mr. Kaplan wasn't responsible
for Liz's death.

38:26.037 --> 38:27.639
You have something new
on Mrs. Lacroix?

38:30.409 --> 38:31.743
Mystery, really.

38:33.812 --> 38:36.014
The assassin was paid
via wire transfer

38:36.147 --> 38:38.016
from an account
at a Lebanese bank.

38:38.149 --> 38:39.851
The only problem is that,
according to public records,

38:39.985 --> 38:42.087
that bank has been
closed for years.

38:42.220 --> 38:43.955
Trying to figure out
how the payment was made now,

38:44.089 --> 38:45.924
but so far, we haven't been
able to find out

38:46.057 --> 38:47.759
anything about
the account holder...

38:48.860 --> 38:50.061
And you never will.

38:51.463 --> 38:53.399
That account is part
of a financial network

38:53.532 --> 38:55.667
more secure
than any other bank on earth.

38:57.102 --> 38:59.270
That's why
I opened the account
in the first place.

39:01.306 --> 39:03.875
The payment for
Mrs. Lacroix's assassin,

39:04.009 --> 39:05.677
it came from your account?

39:05.811 --> 39:07.345
It did.

How was your appointment?

39:35.507 --> 39:37.242
Oh, it was...

39:39.445 --> 39:41.913
You weren't in a fender bender
this morning, were you?

39:42.047 --> 39:44.483
No. Why?

39:45.350 --> 39:46.785
No reason.

39:46.918 --> 39:48.954
Uh, look,
before we get started,

39:49.087 --> 39:51.623
I need you to do me a favor.
This is gonna sound strange,

39:51.757 --> 39:54.159
but I need you to
slap me in the face. Hard.

39:54.292 --> 39:55.794
I know that's a weird...
Ow.

39:55.927 --> 39:58.163
Okay.
(CLEARS THROAT)

39:58.296 --> 39:59.330
Thank you.

40:00.165 --> 40:01.399
Happy to help.

40:09.207 --> 40:12.410
Ever since I got back,
I've been wondering why now?

40:12.544 --> 40:15.614
I've been feeling guilty about
Samar, about Liz for years,

40:15.747 --> 40:19.985
and what happened with Nick
and Greylock was awful, but...

40:20.118 --> 40:23.889
Why did I choose that moment
to totally fall off a cliff?

40:24.022 --> 40:25.023
I'm not sure
you chose anything,

40:25.156 --> 40:28.226
but I'm curious
if you have any ideas.

40:29.360 --> 40:30.696
Well I can't be sure,

40:30.829 --> 40:33.231
but I actually think
it's all your fault.

40:33.364 --> 40:36.201
(CHUCKLES)
I mean, with you in charge,

40:36.334 --> 40:38.870
I always had
someone to rely on.
To make the hard calls.

40:39.004 --> 40:40.872
Take the blame
if things went wrong.

40:42.040 --> 40:44.409
I knew I wasn't ready,
but I was hoping

40:44.543 --> 40:45.877
I'd handle it
a little better.

40:46.945 --> 40:48.246
You're handling it fine.

40:48.379 --> 40:49.781
I've been so anxious
and depressed,

40:49.915 --> 40:51.783
I took an experimental
hallucinogen.

40:52.718 --> 40:53.852
You got help.

40:53.985 --> 40:55.186
And I'm proud of you
for that.

40:56.421 --> 40:57.623
This place is a crucible.

40:57.756 --> 40:59.691
Of course
you were overwhelmed.

40:59.825 --> 41:01.893
You remember
you were kidnapped
about a month ago, right?

41:03.094 --> 41:04.896
This job demands
that you recognize

41:05.030 --> 41:08.399
the things you can control
and the things you can't.

41:08.534 --> 41:09.968
You make the best choices
you can,

41:11.202 --> 41:12.437
then you find a way
to forgive yourself

41:12.571 --> 41:14.606
so you can move forward.

41:14.740 --> 41:16.474
That sounds completely
impossible.

41:17.275 --> 41:18.343
I know.

41:20.045 --> 41:21.479
But you'll learn.

41:21.613 --> 41:23.214
And I'll have your back
while you do.

41:25.016 --> 41:26.284
We all will.
