01:13.568 --> 01:15.736
I've found it.

01:18.507 --> 01:20.474
I have found it.

01:22.144 --> 01:25.579
The secret is to make
the bait look like dinner.

01:25.613 --> 01:28.982
That's why we use live
ones. Does that hurt him?

01:29.017 --> 01:30.851
It's a worm!

01:30.885 --> 01:32.853
You want to make it land with a plop.

01:32.887 --> 01:35.055
The plop grabs their attention.
They think supper has landed.

01:35.089 --> 01:38.058
Why would a worm just go plop
in the middle of the river?

01:38.092 --> 01:40.894
- Does it matter?
- This is boring.

01:40.929 --> 01:44.464
- Worms live in the ground.
- Who cares?

01:44.498 --> 01:47.467
- I got a bite!
- Pull! Reel it in!

01:47.501 --> 01:50.170
- It's a big one!
- It's not boring now, is it?

01:50.204 --> 01:54.707
- It's really big!
- I think it's snagged on something.

01:57.644 --> 01:59.779
Oh, chuffing hell!

02:04.417 --> 02:06.386
- Sir.
- Murdoch.

02:07.020 --> 02:10.622
- What have we, Dr. Grace?
- Male, early forties. Murder victim.

02:10.657 --> 02:12.825
We pulled him out of
the river this morning.

02:12.859 --> 02:15.660
Isn't it also possible he simply drowned?

02:15.695 --> 02:19.064
I'm quite confident in my supposition.

02:20.933 --> 02:22.601
Oh.

02:25.478 --> 02:27.488
It looks like an arrow,
but it's made of metal.

02:29.481 --> 02:31.417
It wasn't fired from a bow.

02:31.452 --> 02:34.152
Maybe a crossbow?

02:34.186 --> 02:37.756
Nothing with a string. See,
no notch here at the back.

02:37.790 --> 02:39.591
It appears to fit

02:39.626 --> 02:42.461
- into a mechanism of some sort.
- Hmm...

02:42.495 --> 02:44.763
I also found these in his pocket.

02:44.797 --> 02:46.598
Emily, I've just...

02:46.633 --> 02:49.134
Oh, sorry. Am I interrupting?

02:49.168 --> 02:51.870
- And you are?
- Lillian Moss,

02:51.904 --> 02:53.872
this is Detective Murdoch.

02:53.906 --> 02:55.606
I've heard a great deal about you.

02:55.641 --> 02:57.375
- Oh?
- Lillian, if you could just

02:57.409 --> 02:59.443
- wait outside...
- Of course.

02:59.478 --> 03:01.412
That's quite alright, Doctor.
I believe we're finished here.

03:01.446 --> 03:03.314
- Yes.
- Miss Moss.

03:09.588 --> 03:11.656
Is that the man Dr. Ogden surrendered

03:11.690 --> 03:14.292
- her political aspirations for?
- He is.

03:14.326 --> 03:16.794
Bit of a stick in the mud.

03:16.828 --> 03:18.796
So what's so important?

03:18.830 --> 03:21.465
Official nomination meeting
has been set for tomorrow.

03:21.500 --> 03:23.700
- Oh.
- Margaret Haile will finally

03:23.734 --> 03:26.136
have a proper platform
to address the voters.

03:26.171 --> 03:28.071
We must be prepared to support her.

03:28.106 --> 03:30.007
Then we'll need more pamphlets, signs.

03:30.041 --> 03:31.875
Perhaps, I could recruit some
of the constables to attend.

03:31.910 --> 03:34.577
This is really happening.

03:34.612 --> 03:38.515
A female candidate for
the Provincial Parliament.

03:38.549 --> 03:42.319
These are great times we're living in.

03:45.556 --> 03:48.491
Sir! What have we?

03:48.526 --> 03:50.694
A receipt of some sort.

03:50.728 --> 03:52.729
"Dry"?

03:52.763 --> 03:55.031
- Dry Cleaning?
- No, I suspect it's

03:55.065 --> 03:57.900
- Dry Goods.
- Mark? Mark's Dry Goods?

04:01.038 --> 04:03.172
Here we are. Have a look

04:03.207 --> 04:05.975
at where the river where we
found the body originates.

04:06.009 --> 04:07.476
"Markham."

04:09.713 --> 04:11.980
I've always liked this
town, sir. Do you remember

04:12.014 --> 04:14.015
- the last time we were here?
- Oh yes!

04:14.050 --> 04:16.552
I believe we were in search of Martians?

04:16.586 --> 04:20.055
Sir, that was naive of me, I admit.

04:20.089 --> 04:22.257
Their gravity on Mars is one third of ours;

04:22.291 --> 04:24.259
a Martian wouldn't be
able to stand up here.

04:24.293 --> 04:26.395
Now, I still think
Venusians are a viable...

04:26.429 --> 04:30.131
George, thank you.

04:33.002 --> 04:34.970
What is that? What is
that you're doing there

04:35.004 --> 04:36.972
with those little cans there?

04:37.006 --> 04:39.707
And straighten those out.
I told you 4 times already!

04:39.742 --> 04:41.743
- You've got to straighten them...
- Excuse me.

04:41.777 --> 04:44.379
Detective William Murdoch,
Toronto Constabulary.

04:44.413 --> 04:47.415
Could I see one of your
blank receipts, please?

04:51.687 --> 04:53.654
What is this regarding?

04:53.689 --> 04:57.725
- _
- A short while ago, thank you George,

04:57.760 --> 05:01.695
this man came in and purchased these items.

05:03.731 --> 05:07.301
I remember him. But he looked
a little better when I saw him.

05:07.335 --> 05:10.637
- How long ago was that?
- Two weeks, give or take.

05:10.671 --> 05:13.607
Came in with another man. They
were looking for the temple.

05:13.641 --> 05:15.742
- The temple?
- It's a local legend.

05:15.777 --> 05:18.978
Some building like the Taj
Mahal in the woods to the west.

05:19.013 --> 05:21.848
The Taj Mahal? Out here?

05:21.883 --> 05:24.117
Don't know if it actually exists.

05:24.151 --> 05:27.186
But they were intent on finding it.

05:27.221 --> 05:29.122
Can you describe the other man?

05:29.156 --> 05:32.492
Older, slightly. Not a
foreigner like this one.

05:32.597 --> 05:36.065
It's about all I can tell you.
They only came in the one time.

05:38.068 --> 05:39.602
Thank you.

05:42.039 --> 05:45.508
George, ask around town
after these two men.

05:45.542 --> 05:47.843
This can't be the only
place where they stopped.

05:47.878 --> 05:50.846
And see what you can find
out about this temple.

05:50.881 --> 05:52.548
Right, sir.

05:54.618 --> 05:56.519
Detective!

05:56.553 --> 05:58.453
The temple he talked about,

05:58.488 --> 06:00.923
- it's not just a legend.
- You've seen it?

06:00.957 --> 06:04.393
When I was a child, we
played there a few times.

06:04.427 --> 06:07.695
- Oh. Where is it?
- Out in the woods

06:07.730 --> 06:10.598
west of town. I can't
remember exactly where.

06:10.933 --> 06:13.201
Are you going to look for it?

06:13.236 --> 06:15.703
- Possibly.
- Be careful.

06:15.738 --> 06:17.872
The building is guarded by a troll.

06:17.907 --> 06:19.241
A troll?

06:19.275 --> 06:23.445
I've seen him myself.
Bug-eyed crazy, lives on rats.

06:23.479 --> 06:25.880
He can't speak but he
can scream like a banshee.

06:25.915 --> 06:29.784
He used to chase us
away if we got too near.

06:29.818 --> 06:32.486
- Thank you very much.
- Sir!

06:32.521 --> 06:34.689
- What have you, George?
- A great deal, sir.

06:34.723 --> 06:36.758
I spoke to the woman who
rented out those two men a room.

06:36.792 --> 06:38.760
- Did you get their names?
- Yes, sir.

06:38.794 --> 06:41.962
Steven Hayes and Bashar Kaba.

06:41.996 --> 06:44.432
Bashar Kaba... is that Arabic?

06:44.466 --> 06:46.934
Turkish, apparently. But,
sir, these two went looking

06:46.968 --> 06:50.471
for the temple two weeks
ago. Haven't been seen since.

06:50.505 --> 06:52.473
What did you find out about the temple?

06:52.507 --> 06:55.409
Well, sir, the locals call
it the Temple of Death.

06:55.444 --> 06:57.678
They say that nobody who's ever gone inside

06:57.712 --> 07:00.681
- has made it out alive.
- Indeed?

07:00.715 --> 07:04.317
Apparently it was built a couple of
decades back by an eccentric millionaire.

07:04.351 --> 07:06.453
And, sir, rumour has it that he killed

07:06.487 --> 07:10.356
his entire family and buried them in there.

07:10.391 --> 07:12.392
Now, other people say that one of his sons

07:12.426 --> 07:15.328
now guards the place. During
the construction of the temple,

07:15.362 --> 07:18.331
it's said that he was hit on
the head by a falling brick

07:18.365 --> 07:20.533
and now he's a bit, ah...

07:20.568 --> 07:22.368
We have to find this building, George.

07:22.403 --> 07:24.504
Agreed, sir. But how?

07:24.538 --> 07:27.173
I have an idea.

07:34.047 --> 07:37.382
What the bloody hell!

07:39.786 --> 07:42.722
- Murdoch?
- Sorry, sir,

07:42.756 --> 07:45.357
- but I have to test the device.
- What device?

07:45.391 --> 07:47.892
- It's a camera.
- For what?

07:47.927 --> 07:49.828
Aerial photography.

07:49.862 --> 07:52.297
Ah.

08:17.136 --> 08:18.970
George!

08:19.004 --> 08:22.406
Sir, are you sure we're
going the right way?

08:22.441 --> 08:24.609
According to my calculations, yes.

08:30.382 --> 08:33.517
- Sir.
- Yes, this is definitely an old foot path.

08:33.552 --> 08:37.287
Sir, you should come look at this.

08:45.997 --> 08:49.299
Sir, it really does look like
the Taj Mahal, doesn't it?

08:49.333 --> 08:53.603
Actually, George, it's
more like the Hagia Sophia.

08:53.638 --> 08:55.605
Ah, yes.

08:55.640 --> 08:57.974
The church built by Emperor
Justinian in the 6th century.

08:58.008 --> 08:59.842
The greatest in all of Christendom

08:59.877 --> 09:02.145
for over a thousand years.

09:02.179 --> 09:05.982
Sir, I've been researching early
Christianity for my new novel.

09:06.016 --> 09:08.184
I see.

09:08.218 --> 09:10.653
George, the Hagia Sophia

09:10.687 --> 09:12.789
was built in Constantinople, wasn't it?

09:12.823 --> 09:16.125
And our victim was Turkish. Do
you think there's a connection?

09:16.160 --> 09:18.194
It's possible.

09:21.064 --> 09:23.365
Uh, sir, are you intending to go inside?

09:23.400 --> 09:26.835
I'm just saying, sir, they
call it the Temple of Death!

09:26.869 --> 09:31.006
Not the Temple of Doom or
the Temple of Dread. Death.

09:31.040 --> 09:34.075
It appears to be open.

09:34.110 --> 09:37.313
See, sir, I dare say, they're
not trying to keep us out;

09:37.347 --> 09:40.849
they're wanting to lure us inside.

09:46.889 --> 09:48.990
Sir, this place is...

09:49.025 --> 09:52.360
It's magnificent!

09:52.394 --> 09:54.696
It's very Byzantine.

09:56.565 --> 09:58.533
Sir, I can't believe a building like this

09:58.567 --> 10:00.668
would just be left abandoned.

10:00.703 --> 10:03.304
I don't believe it is, George.

10:03.339 --> 10:06.407
This has been cleaned by someone recently.

10:06.442 --> 10:10.244
Perhaps by the man who's
said to guard the place.

10:10.278 --> 10:12.947
Hmm...

10:15.817 --> 10:19.820
Sir, what do these mean?

10:19.855 --> 10:23.324
It's Christian iconography, George.

10:23.358 --> 10:25.392
The apostles mainly.

10:25.426 --> 10:28.295
- How can you tell?
- Well, look at this one.

10:28.330 --> 10:30.530
Three bags of money

10:30.565 --> 10:33.066
represent Matthew, the tax collector.

10:36.203 --> 10:38.137
Sir. I've seen this symbol before.

10:41.909 --> 10:44.411
Sir, there's someone in here.

10:44.445 --> 10:46.145
Toronto Constabulary!

10:46.180 --> 10:48.314
Show yourself!

10:55.956 --> 10:57.523
Flank him, George!

10:59.126 --> 11:01.060
Stop! Stop!

11:03.030 --> 11:05.264
Sir, calm down.

11:05.298 --> 11:08.200
Identify yourself,
please. What is your name?

11:10.169 --> 11:13.038
E... E... Enoch.

11:13.072 --> 11:15.841
- What language is this, sir?
- No, George,

11:15.876 --> 11:18.310
I believe that's his name. Enoch?

11:18.344 --> 11:21.146
- Is that it? That's your name?
- Yeah.

11:21.180 --> 11:24.016
Sir, if this is the guardian of the temple

11:24.050 --> 11:27.452
we've heard about, is it
possible he's our killer?

11:27.486 --> 11:31.189
Yes, George, it's possible.

11:31.224 --> 11:35.493
Um, do you have the photograph of Mr. Kaba?

11:35.528 --> 11:38.996
Sir, do you recognize this man?

11:39.031 --> 11:41.065
Uh...

11:43.368 --> 11:46.137
Dead.

11:46.171 --> 11:49.140
Yes, yes, he is dead. How did he die?

11:49.174 --> 11:52.811
Did you kill him?

11:52.845 --> 11:55.079
G... G... God.

11:56.681 --> 11:59.550
God killed him?

11:59.584 --> 12:02.653
He was with another man, wasn't he?

12:02.687 --> 12:05.189
Did the other man kill him?

12:08.626 --> 12:12.930
G... God, God kill.

12:23.374 --> 12:26.343
"I am the Alpha and the Omega.

12:26.377 --> 12:28.744
The first and the last. The beginning

12:28.779 --> 12:30.746
and the end."

12:30.781 --> 12:33.516
- Sir?
- It's a biblical reference,

12:33.550 --> 12:35.818
George, it signifies God Himself.

12:35.853 --> 12:38.088
G... G... God...

12:38.122 --> 12:41.057
kill.

12:41.092 --> 12:43.893
There seems to be something
inside these symbols, George.

12:53.436 --> 12:56.405
God, God, God kill!

12:58.475 --> 12:59.976
Sir!

13:08.351 --> 13:10.552
Well, George...

13:10.586 --> 13:12.954
I believe we've found our killer.

13:17.000 --> 13:17.740
You say the building killed him?

13:17.744 --> 13:20.512
The building is mechanized
to kill whomever performs

13:20.547 --> 13:23.482
a specific sequence of actions.

13:23.516 --> 13:26.385
- What the hell for?
- I have no idea, sir.

13:26.419 --> 13:29.955
According to local lore, it was
built by a wealthy landowner.

13:29.989 --> 13:33.058
You say his son is the guardian of the
place. Does he have anything to offer?

13:33.092 --> 13:36.328
He clearly suffers the effects
of some kind of brain injury.

13:36.362 --> 13:38.696
Find out who owns the land.

13:38.731 --> 13:42.100
We already did. It was
bequeathed to Enoch, the son,

13:42.134 --> 13:44.402
by Arden, the father, in 1878.

13:44.436 --> 13:48.038
This Arden McPhee didn't
build the temple by himself.

13:48.073 --> 13:50.408
He must have used stonemasons, artisans.

13:50.442 --> 13:53.644
If there's stained glass and
plaster icons, people made them.

13:53.679 --> 13:56.247
- People with addresses.
- Good point, sir.

13:56.281 --> 13:58.449
We need to find out more
about this Arden McPhee.

14:01.920 --> 14:04.054
- Ladies.
- Julia.

14:04.089 --> 14:06.257
I'm afraid Margaret can't
make it. She's busy writing

14:06.291 --> 14:08.592
- her nomination speech.
- Isn't this exciting?

14:08.626 --> 14:10.928
The first woman in the
British Empire to stand

14:10.962 --> 14:13.964
on the hustings as a candidate.
Will the press be there?

14:13.999 --> 14:15.732
- Of course.
- I arranged a meeting

14:15.767 --> 14:18.201
with Mr. Magnus Sinclair.
He's prepared to underwrite

14:18.235 --> 14:21.337
- the cost of Margaret's campaign.
- Julia, that's wonderful.

14:21.372 --> 14:24.508
One doesn't need to be in the
spotlight to bring about change.

14:24.542 --> 14:26.576
And, of course, by
staying behind the scenes,

14:26.611 --> 14:28.745
one risks a lot less.

14:31.215 --> 14:33.283
Shall we?

14:34.919 --> 14:38.187
Sir, I found an obituary.

14:38.222 --> 14:40.189
Arden McPhee was an archaeologist.

14:40.224 --> 14:42.392
He lived abroad mostly, which
is why no one remembers him.

14:42.426 --> 14:44.493
- Where abroad?
- Well, according

14:44.528 --> 14:48.464
to the obituary, he returned
from Constantinople in 1877,

14:48.498 --> 14:50.866
- a year before he died.
- How did he die?

14:50.901 --> 14:53.235
A lingering illness is all it said.

14:53.269 --> 14:57.239
But, sir, he was predeceased
by his wife and two daughters.

14:57.273 --> 15:01.176
I checked their records.
They all died in 1877.

15:01.210 --> 15:03.178
Some illness they brought home with them?

15:03.212 --> 15:05.414
Sir, each death was ruled accidental.

15:05.449 --> 15:08.417
- Really? How strange.
- Strange indeed.

15:08.451 --> 15:10.385
Should I return to Markham,
see what I can find?

15:10.420 --> 15:12.620
No, George, I think we
should turn our attentions

15:12.655 --> 15:14.689
to Mr. McPhee's archeological career.

15:14.723 --> 15:17.059
- Right.
- Sir...

15:17.093 --> 15:19.061
I found the plasterer who made the icons

15:19.095 --> 15:21.063
for the temple. His name is Silas Renton.

15:21.097 --> 15:23.765
- Did you bring him in?
- He's passed on, sir.

15:23.799 --> 15:25.767
But I do have the name
of the architectural firm

15:25.801 --> 15:28.402
- who hired him for the job.
- We never built the temple.

15:28.437 --> 15:30.872
We only did some of the interior work.

15:30.906 --> 15:33.374
There were at least three
other firms involved.

15:33.408 --> 15:36.410
And we all worked
independently of each other.

15:36.445 --> 15:39.113
- That must have been difficult.
- It was,

15:39.147 --> 15:42.383
but McPhee insisted on absolute secrecy.

15:42.417 --> 15:45.119
Any communication between the
firms had to go through him,

15:45.153 --> 15:47.488
and all the architectural drawings

15:47.522 --> 15:49.523
had to be surrendered
to him upon completion.

15:49.557 --> 15:51.592
Did you know the building was being armed?

15:51.626 --> 15:53.594
Good God, no.

15:53.628 --> 15:55.796
Never saw a master plan.

15:55.830 --> 15:58.098
And if one existed, I suspect
it was all in McPhee's head.

15:58.132 --> 16:00.100
So you surrendered the
plans upon completion?

16:00.134 --> 16:02.002
Yes...

16:02.036 --> 16:03.971
but we did keep a copy in the company safe,

16:04.005 --> 16:07.508
you know, in case matters
of a legal nature arose.

16:07.542 --> 16:09.510
I suspect the other firms
would have done the same.

16:09.544 --> 16:12.945
Do you know what other
architectural firms were involved?

16:12.980 --> 16:16.883
That was supposed to be a secret
as well. But it's a small world,

16:16.917 --> 16:19.052
and I can give you the names
of at least two of them.

16:20.687 --> 16:23.789
- Success, George?
- Sir, I found some articles.

16:23.824 --> 16:25.992
It's rather dry reading for the most part.

16:26.027 --> 16:28.428
He did most of his
digging in the near east.

16:28.462 --> 16:30.663
In this article, he claims to have found

16:30.697 --> 16:32.665
the lost city of Arimathea.

16:32.699 --> 16:34.967
Indeed!

16:35.002 --> 16:38.838
This was co-written by Mahmoud Bajjali.

16:38.872 --> 16:42.074
- You know him, sir?
- Not of Mahmoud,

16:42.108 --> 16:44.010
but we know an Iris Bajjali.

16:44.044 --> 16:46.245
The woman at the Egyptian exhibit

16:46.279 --> 16:50.382
- with the fondness for snakes!
- One and the same. I wonder...

16:55.555 --> 16:59.224
I'm sorry, this part of
the museum is off-limits.

16:59.259 --> 17:01.360
Dr. Bajjali.

17:01.394 --> 17:04.563
William Murdoch.

17:04.597 --> 17:08.199
To what do I owe this unexpected pleasure?

17:08.233 --> 17:10.233
Mahmoud was my father.

17:10.269 --> 17:13.939
He specialized in artifacts
from the Holy Land.

17:13.973 --> 17:16.339
Did you know an Arden McPhee?

17:16.375 --> 17:18.608
I met him once, actually,

17:18.643 --> 17:21.579
when I was very young.
Six or seven, I think.

17:21.613 --> 17:24.048
He and my father worked
together for a few years

17:24.083 --> 17:27.151
- until they had a falling out.
- What happened?

17:27.185 --> 17:29.153
I don't know.

17:29.188 --> 17:32.457
Arden McPhee was very intense.

17:32.491 --> 17:34.692
I didn't like him much.

17:34.726 --> 17:36.927
Why the sudden interest in him?

17:36.962 --> 17:39.529
Let me show you.

17:39.564 --> 17:43.200
Full dome flanked by two half
domes of the same diameter,

17:43.234 --> 17:45.803
an obvious reference to the Hagia Sophia.

17:47.739 --> 17:50.240
Why would McPhee build such a thing?

17:50.274 --> 17:52.375
To kill people, apparently.

17:52.410 --> 17:54.644
The building is rigged with lethal traps.

17:54.678 --> 17:57.414
- There's one man dead already.
- Who?

17:57.448 --> 18:01.251
Bashar Kaba. Do you know him?

18:01.285 --> 18:03.253
Never heard of him.

18:03.287 --> 18:06.256
Look at the iconography.

18:06.290 --> 18:11.293
That's odd. Why... are
there two of Matthew?

18:11.328 --> 18:13.429
The icons are the same,

18:13.463 --> 18:15.732
but the frieze above is different.

18:15.766 --> 18:18.300
Hmm... What does it mean?

18:18.335 --> 18:20.302
We don't know.

18:20.337 --> 18:24.007
I know.

18:24.041 --> 18:25.941
Oh my.

18:25.975 --> 18:28.277
Sir, the novel that I'm working on now

18:28.311 --> 18:30.279
is about an archaeologist,

18:30.313 --> 18:32.414
but he's sort of a
swashbuckling archaeologist.

18:32.449 --> 18:35.284
A swashbuckling archaeologist, George?

18:35.318 --> 18:37.586
Yes, sir, he's introverted but rugged,

18:37.621 --> 18:40.422
incredibly brave but he
has an Achilles' heel.

18:40.457 --> 18:42.024
What is it?

18:42.058 --> 18:45.627
Butterflies. He's terrified
of them. And of course,

18:45.662 --> 18:48.030
at the end of the novel he has
to crawl in a cave full of them.

18:48.064 --> 18:50.098
What sort of man is afraid of butterflies?

18:50.133 --> 18:52.000
Your point, George?

18:52.035 --> 18:54.435
Sir, I contend that my protagonist

18:54.470 --> 18:56.504
and Arden McPhee were after the same thing.

18:56.539 --> 19:00.141
I believe this icon of money bags is
not a second representation of Matthew,

19:00.176 --> 19:01.942
but rather of Joseph of Arimathea.

19:01.977 --> 19:04.679
He was wealthy, he was also

19:04.713 --> 19:07.815
the disciple that caught
Jesus' blood in a cup,

19:07.849 --> 19:10.385
known by legend

19:10.419 --> 19:14.555
- as the Holy Grail.
- George, I hardly think...

19:14.589 --> 19:17.524
Sir, he found the city of Arimathea!
- Nevertheless...

19:17.559 --> 19:20.895
- He could be right.
- What?

19:20.929 --> 19:24.665
My father was obsessed with the Holy Grail.

19:24.700 --> 19:26.633
It's why he was working with Arden McPhee.

19:26.668 --> 19:28.669
Sir, McPhee must have found it.

19:28.704 --> 19:30.671
Perhaps in Constantinople.

19:30.705 --> 19:32.639
That's why this place
is full of booby traps.

19:32.674 --> 19:35.742
Hidden somewhere in this building...

19:35.776 --> 19:37.911
is the Holy Grail.

19:42.612 --> 19:43.277
The Holy Grail?

19:44.308 --> 19:44.910
In Markham?

19:45.411 --> 19:46.011
Ontario?

19:46.892 --> 19:50.729
- We're positing a theory, sir.
- A very compelling theory.

19:50.763 --> 19:53.298
I'm not entirely convinced myself, but...

19:53.332 --> 19:55.267
Good, because it's bloody crackers.

19:55.301 --> 19:57.602
That's what King Arthur and his
knights were after, isn't it?

19:57.637 --> 20:00.905
- According to legend, yes.
- Then, what's it doing in bloody Markham!?

20:00.939 --> 20:03.574
What was it doing in bloody England?

20:03.608 --> 20:04.876
Ha!

20:04.910 --> 20:07.912
There are a number of reasons

20:07.946 --> 20:10.281
to consider this theory,
sir, predominant of which

20:10.315 --> 20:12.483
is the lack of a compelling alternative.

20:12.517 --> 20:14.585
And the building was booby-trapped

20:14.619 --> 20:17.755
to kill people following
clues to something.

20:17.789 --> 20:19.757
So what's the case then?

20:19.791 --> 20:21.759
We can't exactly throw a building in jail.

20:21.793 --> 20:23.761
Is this just a treasure hunt now?

20:23.795 --> 20:26.297
A search that could end in the Holy Grail.

20:26.331 --> 20:28.332
And how are you gonna go about that?

20:28.366 --> 20:30.834
Well, sir, I've asked
the architectural firms

20:30.868 --> 20:34.037
who built the temple to
provide me with their drawings.

20:34.071 --> 20:38.008
Well, Margaret's
preparing Lancashire hotpot

20:38.042 --> 20:40.210
and that trumps some old
cup any day of the week.

20:40.244 --> 20:42.145
Dr. Bajjali.

20:48.519 --> 20:51.220
And what are you doing for dinner?

20:53.223 --> 20:55.257
My wife will be expecting me.

20:57.127 --> 20:58.828
- Your wife.
- Yes, I...

20:58.862 --> 21:01.564
Well, we...

21:03.456 --> 21:06.291
- Why don't you join us?
- Oh, no...

21:06.325 --> 21:10.161
- Yes, I insist.
- I would love to.

21:13.532 --> 21:15.500
I don't understand.

21:15.534 --> 21:19.304
We always have eat dinner
promptly at 7 o'clock.

21:19.338 --> 21:21.806
I'm sure she will be here soon enough.

21:21.840 --> 21:23.841
Yes.

21:25.844 --> 21:27.879
Oh!

21:33.786 --> 21:35.219
Hello?

21:35.253 --> 21:36.888
Yes.

21:36.922 --> 21:39.390
Yes.

21:39.425 --> 21:42.326
Of course, of course, that's fine.

21:42.360 --> 21:45.495
All right, we'll see you later.

21:50.435 --> 21:52.869
Julia won't be joining us.

21:54.272 --> 21:57.140
Oh.

21:57.174 --> 22:01.010
- Just the two of us, then?
- So it appears.

22:03.047 --> 22:05.148
So let's eat.

22:07.151 --> 22:10.386
I always understood it to be the cup

22:10.421 --> 22:12.489
Christ used at the Last Supper.

22:12.523 --> 22:15.058
Yes, a common misconception.

22:15.092 --> 22:17.226
But, as your constable said,

22:17.261 --> 22:20.563
the Grail is associated
with Joseph of Arimathea.

22:20.597 --> 22:23.399
The man who collected Christ's body

22:23.434 --> 22:26.035
- after the trial and execution.
- Exactly.

22:26.070 --> 22:28.338
Most experts believe it was the vessel

22:28.372 --> 22:30.840
used by Joseph to capture Jesus' blood

22:30.874 --> 22:33.008
as it drained from his body.

22:33.042 --> 22:36.011
That's why it was thought to be holy.

22:36.045 --> 22:38.647
- So what happened to it?
- There are reports

22:38.682 --> 22:41.383
that both the Grail and the burial shroud

22:41.417 --> 22:43.452
were taken by Joseph to Edessa.

22:43.487 --> 22:45.488
I always understood that

22:45.522 --> 22:48.457
- Joseph brought it to Britain.
- Another common misconception.

22:48.491 --> 22:51.393
Joseph brought it to a palace

22:51.427 --> 22:53.628
in Edessa called Britium.

22:53.662 --> 22:58.400
Oh. So how did it end up in Constantinople?

22:58.434 --> 23:02.237
I imagine it was brought there for
safe-keeping after the Islamic conquest.

23:02.271 --> 23:04.572
Certainly, the crusaders thought

23:04.607 --> 23:07.976
it was there. They ransacked
the Hagia Sophia looking for it.

23:08.010 --> 23:11.245
Iris, this is the Holy Grail

23:11.279 --> 23:13.247
we are speaking about.

23:13.281 --> 23:16.751
The most sought-after
artifact in all of Christendom.

23:16.785 --> 23:20.221
What are the odds that it's here?

23:20.255 --> 23:23.257
If the Holy Grail exists,

23:23.291 --> 23:25.759
it has to exist somewhere.

23:25.793 --> 23:28.462
Is there any reason it cannot be here?

23:28.497 --> 23:30.498
I suppose not.

23:30.532 --> 23:34.268
If McPhee did find it,

23:34.302 --> 23:36.603
then why hide it?

23:36.638 --> 23:38.772
Why not claim the glory for himself?

23:38.806 --> 23:42.042
You said he was stricken with illness,

23:42.076 --> 23:44.177
and that he lost his family.

23:44.211 --> 23:47.915
Perhaps McPhee believed he had angered God

23:47.949 --> 23:51.084
by removing the holy relic
from its rightful place.

23:51.118 --> 23:54.887
He could not bring it
back to the Hagia Sophia.

23:54.922 --> 23:58.124
So he built a replica on his
own land and hid it there.

23:58.159 --> 24:01.094
You make a compelling argument.

24:01.128 --> 24:04.564
I'm glad to see I have
the power to persuade you.

24:04.598 --> 24:07.900
So, William,

24:07.935 --> 24:11.236
shall you and I go and find our Holy Grail?

24:16.109 --> 24:18.110
To tell you the truth,
I'm rather torn. I mean,

24:18.144 --> 24:21.814
I would love to find the Holy Grail,
but it would certainly snuff my new book.

24:21.848 --> 24:25.584
Why does anyone care about
the Holy Grail? It's a cup.

24:25.618 --> 24:27.819
Higgins, it's a holy relic, man!

24:27.853 --> 24:30.155
It could have supernatural powers.

24:30.190 --> 24:32.224
- What kind of powers?
- Well, who knows?

24:32.258 --> 24:34.926
God is full of surprises. In my novel,

24:34.961 --> 24:37.762
it confers invisibility,
which comes in very handy

24:37.797 --> 24:39.931
for my protagonist at a crucial point.

24:39.966 --> 24:42.200
He's about to be eaten by
a tribe of cannibals, and...

24:42.234 --> 24:44.202
- Morning, sir.
- Morning, gentlemen.

24:44.236 --> 24:46.204
Are these the plans we requested?

24:46.238 --> 24:48.873
- This is what we were given.
- Hmm...

24:52.277 --> 24:54.479
Ah. Geometry?

24:54.513 --> 24:57.782
Uh, yes, sir. Have a look at
this. The basement of the temple

24:57.817 --> 24:59.850
is divided into two large rooms,

24:59.884 --> 25:02.019
each 27 feet wide.

25:02.053 --> 25:04.155
But the main floor of the
temple is 60 feet wide.

25:04.189 --> 25:08.526
- So?
- So 2 times 27 is 54.

25:08.560 --> 25:11.262
Even allowing for a one-foot thickness

25:11.296 --> 25:13.364
for these two walls, that still leaves

25:13.398 --> 25:15.432
four feet unaccounted for.

25:15.466 --> 25:19.803
- A secret passageway.
- Running right underneath the main floor.

25:19.838 --> 25:22.606
- Sirs?
- What is it, Henry?

25:22.641 --> 25:24.608
They've found another body.

25:24.643 --> 25:28.478
Dr. Grace.

25:28.513 --> 25:32.349
- Another victim of the temple?
- He preceded the first.

25:32.383 --> 25:34.884
This one's been in the
water at least two weeks.

25:34.918 --> 25:37.887
The top of the his skull
is partially caved in.

25:37.921 --> 25:41.691
- Any idea what from?
- Impossible to tell at this point.

25:41.725 --> 25:45.228
I'll need to remove the scalp. But
it appears to be what killed him.

25:48.065 --> 25:51.067
We have the right to our
demands! Votes for women!

25:51.101 --> 25:53.703
Are you just going to
refuse to speak to me?

25:53.737 --> 25:56.673
We can still put on a spirited
debate for these people, Dr. Beattie.

25:56.707 --> 25:58.708
What's going on?

25:58.742 --> 26:02.244
- Why is everyone leaving?
- I don't know. Margaret?

26:02.279 --> 26:05.347
Mr. Marter has a cold and can't speak,

26:05.382 --> 26:08.750
and Dr. Nesbitt is refusing
to speak out of sympathy.

26:08.785 --> 26:11.153
So it appears this meeting is over.

26:11.188 --> 26:13.322
What about you and your right to speak?

26:13.356 --> 26:15.757
They're completely indifferent
to my presence here.

26:15.792 --> 26:21.362
- This won't do. Your platform will be heard.
- Julia, what are you doing?

26:21.397 --> 26:23.832
Ladies and gentlemen!

26:23.866 --> 26:27.669
It appears Dr. Nesbitt and
Mr. Marter are unwilling

26:27.704 --> 26:30.872
to engage in intelligent
debate. Well, Ms. Margaret Haile

26:30.907 --> 26:34.342
is not. In fact, she relishes it.

26:34.376 --> 26:37.012
And gentlemen of the press,
do you not think that the city

26:37.046 --> 26:40.781
of Toronto deserves to hear a
woman's words? Do you not wish

26:40.816 --> 26:43.351
to record this pivotal moment
in our fair city's history?

26:43.385 --> 26:45.920
Ladies and gentlemen,

26:45.954 --> 26:49.691
I give you our Socialist Candidate
for the riding of North Toronto,

26:49.725 --> 26:52.727
Ms. Margaret Haile!

26:52.761 --> 26:56.230
I think perhaps I may have
misjudged your Dr. Ogden.

26:56.264 --> 26:59.800
Thank you Dr. Ogden for your introduction.

26:59.835 --> 27:03.303
And thank you all for coming out
today in support of our cause.

27:15.149 --> 27:17.251
Iris.

27:17.285 --> 27:20.220
I telephoned the station. You were out.

27:20.255 --> 27:22.656
There's been another victim.

27:22.690 --> 27:25.058
- Of the temple?
- Very likely.

27:25.092 --> 27:28.594
Oh, that's terrible. Is it
true? Have you found evidence

27:28.629 --> 27:31.264
of a secret passage?

27:31.298 --> 27:33.933
Because I think I've discovered
something very interesting.

27:33.968 --> 27:37.203
Just one moment, Doctor.

27:37.238 --> 27:39.672
Enoch, I have a question for you.

27:42.143 --> 27:44.343
Do you recognize this man?

27:44.378 --> 27:47.179
His face would have been thinner,

27:47.213 --> 27:51.984
but his beard and his hair are the same.

27:52.018 --> 27:55.588
- Mm... Not... Not there.
- Yes, I know.

27:55.622 --> 27:58.123
His body washed down the river.

27:58.158 --> 28:00.826
But did this building kill him as well?

28:00.860 --> 28:03.595
Mm... God.

28:03.629 --> 28:06.999
- God...
- William,

28:07.033 --> 28:09.101
I think I've figured something out.

28:09.135 --> 28:12.304
All of these saints were martyrs.

28:12.338 --> 28:16.374
Paul himself preached the
virtue of suffering like Christ.

28:16.409 --> 28:20.779
I think the key to finding
the secret passage is to suffer

28:20.813 --> 28:23.481
like Christ.

28:23.516 --> 28:25.684
Christ was crucified.

28:25.718 --> 28:28.152
Exactly.

28:30.289 --> 28:34.458
What if I place my arms thus?

28:40.332 --> 28:42.967
Oh, it's working!

28:43.001 --> 28:45.336
Iris!

28:45.370 --> 28:48.306
Oh! My God...

28:48.340 --> 28:52.008
You saved my life.

28:52.043 --> 28:54.244
William, look.

28:54.278 --> 28:57.147
Doctor, wait...

28:57.181 --> 28:59.616
This building is designed to kill anyone

28:59.651 --> 29:01.719
who searches for the Grail.

29:03.722 --> 29:06.089
I'm prepared to risk the
wrath of God if you are.

29:10.461 --> 29:12.528
Stay behind me.

29:24.508 --> 29:27.209
Watch your head.

29:37.120 --> 29:39.521
- It's Greek?
- Byzantine.

29:39.555 --> 29:41.523
What does it say?

29:41.557 --> 29:44.860
"Whoever passes this point shall perish

29:44.895 --> 29:48.630
and bring a curse upon their loved ones."

29:48.664 --> 29:52.534
Why Byzantine Greek here?

29:52.568 --> 29:55.270
I suspect it must be a replica of the curse

29:55.304 --> 29:58.006
McPhee encountered while he
was searching for the Grail

29:58.040 --> 30:00.341
beneath the Hagia Sophia.

30:08.650 --> 30:12.453
- What are you looking for?
- Trip wires, anything.

30:12.487 --> 30:15.556
Be careful. Don't touch the walls.

30:21.563 --> 30:24.465
What was that?

30:27.201 --> 30:30.137
Why is nothing happening?

30:30.171 --> 30:32.372
I suspect the blades won't move

30:32.407 --> 30:34.475
until I lift my foot off of the trigger.

30:34.509 --> 30:38.378
What should we do?

30:42.016 --> 30:43.984
Try pressing your back against the wall

30:44.018 --> 30:46.920
and putting your feet
up on the opposite wall.

30:49.657 --> 30:53.059
Keep your body between the two blades.

30:55.763 --> 30:59.866
- Ready?
- Yes.

30:59.900 --> 31:02.836
Oh my God!

31:02.870 --> 31:06.005
Are you alright?

31:06.039 --> 31:09.075
I think so.

31:13.246 --> 31:16.115
My skirt didn't fare so well, though.

31:16.149 --> 31:18.217
I won't look.

31:28.495 --> 31:30.996
Oh, my God!

31:31.030 --> 31:33.331
Iris, wait!

31:33.366 --> 31:35.467
It's a cobweb.

31:35.502 --> 31:39.738
What's a cobweb if not a trap?

31:50.349 --> 31:55.053
Whoa! Oh! Wow...

31:57.156 --> 32:00.858
- Do you think it's safe now?
- No.

32:04.930 --> 32:09.466
The gas must be expended.

32:25.583 --> 32:28.218
Oh, it's beautiful!

32:28.253 --> 32:31.087
It's just as I imagined.

32:31.121 --> 32:33.857
Iris, what are the chances

32:33.891 --> 32:36.526
that the Holy Grail would be

32:36.561 --> 32:39.829
just as you imagined?

32:39.864 --> 32:44.067
Ah... a decoy.

33:09.258 --> 33:11.727
Oh, William...

33:15.665 --> 33:17.833
Careful...

33:45.127 --> 33:48.329
Is it the Holy Grail?

33:48.363 --> 33:50.264
I'm not sure...

33:50.298 --> 33:52.266
It's ceramic,

33:52.300 --> 33:54.535
which is surprising, I...

33:54.569 --> 33:57.538
I thought it would be silver or brass.

33:57.572 --> 34:01.342
But it looks first century.

34:01.376 --> 34:04.678
So it could be?

34:04.712 --> 34:08.047
Yes, it could.

34:10.752 --> 34:15.388
William, I think we've
just found the Holy Grail.

34:24.231 --> 34:26.565
Ah, Dr. Grace.

34:26.600 --> 34:29.135
I've determined the cause of
death of the second victim.

34:29.170 --> 34:31.337
- Head trauma?
- Strangulation.

34:31.371 --> 34:33.906
I thought his head was bashed in?

34:33.940 --> 34:35.908
It was, and I assumed that
that was the cause of death,

34:35.942 --> 34:38.043
but once I peeled back the
flesh I found that the bone

34:38.078 --> 34:40.079
had healed over long ago.

34:40.112 --> 34:42.148
- How long ago?
- By the extent of bone growth,

34:42.183 --> 34:44.382
I assume the injury occurred in childhood.

34:47.853 --> 34:51.991
Dr. Grace... the man in your
morgue must be Enoch McPhee.

34:52.025 --> 34:54.694
So who is pretending to be Enoch?

34:58.464 --> 35:00.465
I'll be taking that, Detective.

35:05.316 --> 35:08.530
- I don't understand.
- I do.

35:09.548 --> 35:12.317
This isn't Enoch McPhee.

35:12.351 --> 35:14.919
This is Mr. Kaba's assistant, Steven Hayes.

35:14.953 --> 35:18.488
- Pleased to make your acquaintance.
- The second victim we found

35:18.523 --> 35:22.058
- that was Enoch, wasn't it?
- I'm afraid so.

35:22.092 --> 35:25.562
- You killed him?
- I had no choice.

35:25.596 --> 35:28.532
He c... c... couldn't be reasoned with,

35:28.566 --> 35:30.567
poor man.

35:30.601 --> 35:34.570
I'm hoping the same cannot be said of you.

35:34.604 --> 35:38.174
Mr. Hayes, is this
really worth killing for?

35:38.209 --> 35:42.846
The Grail is not some artifact, Detective.

35:42.880 --> 35:46.749
It has been imbued with
the blood of Christ himself.

35:46.783 --> 35:51.354
It has... power.

35:51.388 --> 35:53.622
Of course it's worth killing for.

35:53.657 --> 35:56.091
Give it to me.

35:56.125 --> 35:58.927
Now.

36:05.602 --> 36:08.103
Now get back down the stairs.

36:08.137 --> 36:11.373
- No!
- Do as he says, Doctor.

36:11.407 --> 36:14.309
- He's going to take the...
- Just do it.

36:31.427 --> 36:34.095
He's getting away. He's
getting away with the Grail!

36:34.129 --> 36:37.565
I'm more concerned that he's
getting away with murder.

36:40.936 --> 36:42.503
What are you doing?

36:42.537 --> 36:45.372
When you pressed against
the posts at the altar

36:45.407 --> 36:48.174
you tripped a wire that
engaged these ratchets,

36:48.209 --> 36:50.444
allowing these
counter-weights to come down

36:50.478 --> 36:52.613
and the door to open.

36:52.647 --> 36:54.782
If we want the door to open again,

36:54.816 --> 36:57.451
we have to disengage these ratchets.

37:02.990 --> 37:06.426
That should do it...

37:11.265 --> 37:14.500
Get after him!

37:26.012 --> 37:28.815
Argh!

37:42.628 --> 37:44.896
Mr. Hayes! Stop!

38:09.254 --> 38:10.554
Nowhere to go!

38:10.589 --> 38:12.490
- You're under arrest.
- Never!

38:12.524 --> 38:16.294
I've been searching my
entire life for this.

38:18.797 --> 38:20.764
- It's a 60
- foot drop.

38:20.799 --> 38:24.702
But you forget; the Grail has power.

38:24.736 --> 38:28.238
What power?

38:28.272 --> 38:31.008
God's protection.

38:31.042 --> 38:33.911
No!

38:52.230 --> 38:55.232
Carefully, sir, it is ceramic.

38:55.266 --> 38:57.534
So this is it then?

38:57.568 --> 38:59.569
This is the Holy Grail?

38:59.603 --> 39:03.740
- Well, we'll have to call in Milton Webb.
- Pottery expert.

39:03.774 --> 39:07.744
But... yes. I believe it is.

39:07.778 --> 39:11.180
Can you imagine; that cup actually touched

39:11.214 --> 39:13.349
Jesus' lips at the Last Supper.

39:13.383 --> 39:16.519
I thought it was used to catch
his blood after his death?

39:16.553 --> 39:19.321
- Uh... It was both.
- Why?

39:19.356 --> 39:22.191
Were they that short of
goblets back in those days?

39:22.225 --> 39:25.561
... Unbelievable!

39:25.595 --> 39:28.330
Dr. Bajjali. If you'll just
give us a moment, please.

39:28.365 --> 39:30.532
Murdoch...

39:32.535 --> 39:35.470
Look, if this is the one true Holy Grail...

39:35.504 --> 39:38.506
Well, there's gonna be
a bit of a hullabaloo.

39:38.541 --> 39:41.810
International press, parade down
King Street, the whole shebang.

39:41.844 --> 39:45.948
- Yes, I suppose so, sir.
- Who owns it?

39:45.982 --> 39:50.918
Well, it doesn't belong to
any... person, sir, it's...

39:52.888 --> 39:56.624
Well sir, if it's the genuine
article, it belongs to God.

39:56.658 --> 39:59.760
It should be in the Vatican,
or at the very least the museum.

39:59.795 --> 40:03.097
What about Dr. Bajjali?
Does she have a claim?

40:03.131 --> 40:05.600
Her claim is equal to mine.
But as I said, it doesn't belong

40:05.634 --> 40:08.069
to any person.

40:08.103 --> 40:10.705
Right, then.

40:10.739 --> 40:13.207
Oh, no...

40:15.510 --> 40:18.479
She can't have gone far.

40:20.748 --> 40:23.317
Taxi!

40:23.351 --> 40:26.052
Iris!

40:26.087 --> 40:29.256
- Give it back.
- I'm sorry, William.

40:29.290 --> 40:31.825
You said yourself...
it's the most sought-after

40:31.859 --> 40:33.960
artifact in all of Christendom.

40:33.995 --> 40:36.362
It's worth millions.

40:36.396 --> 40:38.464
I could fund any expedition.

40:38.499 --> 40:40.834
It doesn't belong to you!

40:40.868 --> 40:43.302
I was the first person to touch it.

40:43.337 --> 40:46.572
- It belongs to me.
- It belongs to God!

40:46.607 --> 40:49.342
There is no God!

41:04.981 --> 41:06.930
Very interesting.

41:08.185 --> 41:10.752
- "Interesting" as this is the Holy Grail?
- No.

41:10.854 --> 41:13.622
Interesting because you
rarely see pieces like this.

41:13.656 --> 41:17.692
They were only made in
the first century. You see

41:17.726 --> 41:20.995
- these markings here?
- It's a squiggle. What of it?

41:21.030 --> 41:24.199
The first century was a
dangerous period for Christians.

41:24.233 --> 41:28.369
They needed a way to
secretly identify one another.

41:28.403 --> 41:30.872
The various Christograms

41:30.906 --> 41:33.107
were well-known by the authorities.

41:33.142 --> 41:35.943
Especially the fish symbol.

41:35.978 --> 41:38.680
But if one were to

41:38.714 --> 41:41.282
place another cup upside-down

41:41.316 --> 41:43.517
atop the first...

41:47.255 --> 41:51.559
There.

41:51.593 --> 41:54.895
So it's Christian. Now,
is it the Grail or not?

41:54.929 --> 41:58.499
Inspector, Christianity did not
begin until after Christ's death.

41:58.533 --> 42:01.201
A cup with the symbol of the risen Christ

42:01.235 --> 42:04.504
could hardly have caught his blood.

42:04.538 --> 42:07.451
- So my book...
- Sod your book.

42:08.252 --> 42:09.537
Feel free to write it, George.

42:09.543 --> 42:11.644
I don't think the true
Grail will be uncovered

42:11.678 --> 42:13.846
- anytime soon.
- I knew it.

42:13.881 --> 42:16.849
The Holy Grail would be
made of silver or gold.

42:16.884 --> 42:18.851
Sirs....

42:18.886 --> 42:20.853
This could still be the cup.

42:20.888 --> 42:23.255
What if McPhee was trying to disguise it?

42:23.289 --> 42:25.391
What better way to hide the
Holy Grail than encase it

42:25.425 --> 42:27.326
in something that proves it's not?

42:28.361 --> 42:31.664
- Sir...
- George, we are hardly going to

42:31.698 --> 42:34.299
destroy a ceramic artifact
from the first century

42:34.334 --> 42:37.036
to prove your theory.

42:37.070 --> 42:40.072
So what becomes of it?

42:40.106 --> 42:42.841
Well, it's an interesting piece.

42:42.875 --> 42:46.945
- I would like to have it at the museum.
- Done.

43:00.392 --> 43:03.461
My God!

43:05.898 --> 43:08.299
My God...
