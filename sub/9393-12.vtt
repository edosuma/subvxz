01:42.321 --> 01:44.439
It's a beautiful day.

01:44.473 --> 01:46.274
Um, yeah, I'm just glad
I didn't die

01:46.308 --> 01:48.092
from the weird
sleep-breathing thing I have.

01:49.728 --> 01:51.929
(screaming)

01:56.552 --> 01:58.903
You know, Peter, since
it's Valentine's Day

01:58.921 --> 02:00.738
I was thinking
let's do something

02:00.773 --> 02:02.273
we've never
done before.

02:02.307 --> 02:03.991
Release the virus?

02:04.026 --> 02:06.828
No, I was thinking we could
spend the whole day in bed.

Oh, that's a great idea.

02:08.564 --> 02:12.433
Permission to begin a day of
epic lovemaking, sexy lady.

02:12.468 --> 02:14.635

granted, sir.

PETER: <i>And if I need help,</i>

02:16.872 --> 02:18.940

Yeah, you slut.

02:20.709 --> 02:23.594
Doth the magistrate know
what you're doing tonight?

02:23.629 --> 02:24.862
Good.

02:24.897 --> 02:28.416
Now, undo the top six buttons
of your 100-button shoes.

02:34.239 --> 02:35.373
Wow, Meg,
you look nice.

02:35.407 --> 02:36.607
You got a date?

02:36.642 --> 02:39.010
Yeah, I totally hit it
off with this great guy

02:39.044 --> 02:40.964
in the Internet, and we're
finally going to meet.

02:40.979 --> 02:43.081
Okay, remember to ask
questions about him.

02:43.115 --> 02:46.184
Seem interested.
Listen. Giggle.

02:46.218 --> 02:47.468
Swallow.

Toby?

02:52.508 --> 02:53.624
Meg?

02:53.659 --> 02:56.027
Hi. Wow, you look just
like your picture.

02:56.061 --> 02:58.529
You don't look
anything like yours.

03:00.999 --> 03:03.835
Yeah, that's a candid
from a summer job I had.

03:03.869 --> 03:05.636
Well, you're much
prettier in person.

03:05.671 --> 03:06.637
Shall we go?

03:06.672 --> 03:07.672
Yeah, sure.

03:07.706 --> 03:09.107
Don't wait up, boys.

03:10.726 --> 03:11.759
I like him.

03:11.794 --> 03:13.177
Really? He seems
kind of lame.

03:13.212 --> 03:14.729
But, I guess
every girl

03:14.763 --> 03:16.497
has her own version
of Prince Charming.

03:16.532 --> 03:18.099
I'm in love with Paul.

03:18.133 --> 03:19.567
I'm in love
with John.

03:19.601 --> 03:20.635
You know what?

03:20.669 --> 03:22.370
I'm in love
with Ringo.

03:22.421 --> 03:23.421
What?

03:23.455 --> 03:24.522
Um, I said...

03:24.556 --> 03:25.890
I don't-I don't know
what I said.

03:25.924 --> 03:27.892
Sounded like you said you
were in love with Ringo.

03:27.926 --> 03:30.428
Um, I don't...
I don't think so.

03:30.462 --> 03:32.830
Pretty sure you said
"I'm in love with Ringo."

03:32.865 --> 03:33.965
Here I am.

03:33.999 --> 03:35.266
Are Paul and John
out there?

03:35.300 --> 03:37.151
Nope, just Ringo.

03:43.742 --> 03:45.443
Oh, you're still here?

03:45.477 --> 03:47.278
Yeah, after
a wonderful night

03:47.312 --> 03:49.063
I-I thought we could
get some breakfast.

03:49.114 --> 03:51.716
(laughing): Clearly, you're not
familiar with how this works.

03:51.750 --> 03:53.311
See, you're supposed
to be already gone.

03:53.335 --> 03:54.368
There's no breakfast.

03:54.403 --> 03:56.087
Here, let me help you
to the door.

03:59.408 --> 04:01.192
You're a jerk,
Glenn Quagmire.

04:01.210 --> 04:03.411
One of these days, you're
going to get what you deserve.

04:03.428 --> 04:04.879
You better put
something warm on.

04:04.913 --> 04:07.748
You got an icicle
forming down there.

04:08.984 --> 04:11.169

04:44.269 --> 04:45.570
Hold it together, Quagmire.

04:45.604 --> 04:47.688
You probably just had
one too many drinks last night.

04:47.723 --> 04:48.739

04:48.757 --> 04:49.974

God, I thought
I was in trouble for a minute.

04:59.902 --> 05:01.736
Hey, toots, you know
why I pulled you over?

05:01.770 --> 05:03.604
You were going too
sexy in a 35 zone.

05:03.639 --> 05:04.972
I'll need to see
your driver's license.

05:05.007 --> 05:06.007
What?

05:06.041 --> 05:07.542
Joe, what the hell's
wrong with you?

05:07.576 --> 05:08.559
It's me, Quagmire.

05:08.594 --> 05:10.595
JOE:
Glenda Vajmire.

05:10.629 --> 05:12.663
Well, how would you
like to spend four hours

05:12.698 --> 05:15.533
desperately trying to
give me a muscular soldier?

05:15.567 --> 05:16.751
What the hell,
you weirdo?

05:16.785 --> 05:17.752
(laughing)

05:17.786 --> 05:19.153
I'm just having fun.

05:19.187 --> 05:22.173
In fact, as I say to all
the ladies, giggity-giggity.

05:22.207 --> 05:23.874
You don't say that.
I say that.

05:23.909 --> 05:25.042
You're a bad person.

05:33.769 --> 05:34.936
Hey, Stewie,
what are you doing?

05:34.970 --> 05:36.971
Well, Brian, in honor
of Valentine's Day

05:37.005 --> 05:38.706
I thought why not
go back in time

05:38.740 --> 05:40.608
to that summer of love
in the '60s

05:40.642 --> 05:41.909
that everyone's always
talking about.

05:41.944 --> 05:43.177
Oh, cool.

05:43.211 --> 05:45.529
Hey, you think you might be
able to get me some acid?

05:45.547 --> 05:47.064
I'll get you rolled-up
newspaper on the snout

05:47.099 --> 05:48.215
is what I'll get you.

05:48.250 --> 05:50.084
Very. Bad. Dog.

05:57.593 --> 06:00.928
Well, here we are, Rupert:
Quahog's summer of love.

06:00.963 --> 06:05.132
♪

06:09.071 --> 06:11.706

06:17.228 --> 06:18.779
Hello.

06:18.814 --> 06:19.981
Oh, this must be yours.

06:20.015 --> 06:21.349
Thanks.

06:21.383 --> 06:23.784
My God, she's incredible.

06:23.819 --> 06:26.520
Rupert, I must bring her
back to the present

06:26.555 --> 06:28.122
and raise her to be my wife.

06:29.074 --> 06:32.209
Oh, God, I bet that diaper
is soaking wet.

06:33.779 --> 06:35.830
I can't let her get away.

06:38.050 --> 06:39.233
Oh, hi.

06:39.267 --> 06:42.536
Oh, hey, um, I just
came to say, um...

06:42.571 --> 06:45.806
you know, in a couple of years
something's going to come along

06:45.841 --> 06:46.841
called Sesame Street.

06:46.875 --> 06:48.776
And I know the name
makes it sounds Asian,

06:48.810 --> 06:51.212
but it's not, and it's
going to blow your mind.

06:51.246 --> 06:52.546
Oh, the hell with it.

06:52.581 --> 06:54.482
The real reason I ran
over here is because

06:54.516 --> 06:57.284
I wanted to do this.

06:57.319 --> 07:00.738
There's my little Lois.

07:00.772 --> 07:01.806
What?

07:01.840 --> 07:02.873
Lois?!

07:02.908 --> 07:04.608
Come on, honey.
Hop in Daddy's car.

07:04.643 --> 07:05.943
You can crawl around
on the floor

07:05.977 --> 07:07.611
while I drink, smoke,
and drive us home.

07:08.296 --> 07:11.749
(hyperventilating)

07:18.340 --> 07:21.042
(gagging)

07:21.076 --> 07:22.343
Oh, my God, Stewie,
what happened?

07:22.377 --> 07:24.045
None of your (bleep)
business what happened.

07:24.079 --> 07:26.113
Geez, you kiss your mother
with that mouth?

07:34.089 --> 07:35.506
Do you like Coldplay?

07:35.540 --> 07:37.174
Uh, am I a dull
white guy?

07:37.209 --> 07:38.542
Yes, I like Coldplay.

07:38.577 --> 07:41.645
God, Toby, I can't believe
how much we have in common.

07:41.680 --> 07:43.948
It's like we were meant
to find each other.

07:43.982 --> 07:45.032
I know.

07:45.067 --> 07:46.150
To us.

07:46.184 --> 07:47.785
Meg, if you were
any more beautiful,

07:47.819 --> 07:49.186
that'd be neat.

07:51.223 --> 07:53.657
So, what should be do next...

07:58.947 --> 08:00.481
(screaming)

08:00.532 --> 08:01.866
Oh, my God!

08:01.900 --> 08:03.868
Toby, what happened?

08:03.902 --> 08:06.437
Oh, I just harvested
your kidney.

08:06.471 --> 08:08.205
(gasps) Look at the
size of this scar.

08:08.240 --> 08:11.075
Sorry. It's my first day
on this job.

08:11.109 --> 08:12.877
Well, where did
you work before?

08:12.911 --> 08:13.978
Circuit City.

08:14.012 --> 08:15.980
So, I haven't worked
in, like, two years.

08:22.730 --> 08:24.664
Toby, I can't believe
you took my kidney.

08:24.698 --> 08:25.965
You bastard!

08:26.000 --> 08:27.033
Sorry, Meg.

08:27.067 --> 08:28.401
Black market organs
are big money

08:28.435 --> 08:30.403
and I promised my bosses
a fresh kidney.

08:30.437 --> 08:31.938
No hard feelings.

08:31.972 --> 08:32.938
Wait!

08:32.972 --> 08:35.241
You also made
a promise to me.

08:35.275 --> 08:37.610
You promised we'd spend
Valentine's Day together.

08:37.644 --> 08:39.345
The whole day.

08:39.395 --> 08:41.731
And I'm not letting you
break that promise.

08:41.765 --> 08:43.900
Well, I guess a deal's a deal.

08:43.933 --> 08:45.134
Okay.

08:46.670 --> 08:49.539
By the way, did you know
you had a tiny conjoined twin

08:49.573 --> 08:50.573
attached to your hip?

08:52.142 --> 08:53.209
Is it worth anything?

08:53.243 --> 08:54.343
It is to me.

08:54.378 --> 08:55.811
I've been using it
as a bookmark.

09:02.920 --> 09:04.454
Peter, what's all this?

09:04.488 --> 09:06.756
Oh, Quagmire loaned me this book
called the <i>Kama Sutra.</i>

09:06.790 --> 09:07.790
It's Indian.

09:07.824 --> 09:09.208
And who has better sex

09:09.259 --> 09:11.477
than people who don't
use toilet paper?

09:11.512 --> 09:14.230
I don't know, Peter.
That doesn't sound very sexy.

09:14.264 --> 09:15.348
What are you
talking about?

09:15.382 --> 09:16.499
Bombay is sperm city.

09:16.517 --> 09:18.317
<i>Slumdog Millionaire?</i>

09:18.352 --> 09:21.020
More like
<i>Scumdog Put-it-there.</i>

09:21.055 --> 09:23.890
Peter, these candles are
getting wax all over the floor.

09:23.941 --> 09:25.508
That's okay. Isn't
Consuela coming today?

09:25.526 --> 09:28.745
No, she spends Valentine's Day
with her husband.

09:39.757 --> 09:41.874
Wait, but she's sneaking
<i>out</i> of the U.S.

09:41.909 --> 09:43.209
This is Arizona.

09:43.243 --> 09:45.461
You can shoot a Mexican
for using a water fountain.

09:49.266 --> 09:50.316
(dress rips)

09:50.350 --> 09:52.118
Oh, I fix later.

09:54.054 --> 09:55.471
(sirens blaring)

09:57.341 --> 09:59.342
Happy Valentine's
Day, Juan.

09:59.376 --> 10:01.244
And to you, <i>mi amor.</i>

10:01.278 --> 10:03.579
One minute, I
freshen up first.

10:06.517 --> 10:08.484
Okay.

10:08.519 --> 10:12.721
CONSUELA:
<i>Sí, sí, sí...</i> oh, yeah.

10:21.148 --> 10:22.248
Hi.

10:22.282 --> 10:25.918
Oh, hey, um, I think I might
have the wrong address.

10:25.953 --> 10:27.820
I'm looking for
Mr. Herbert's house.

10:27.855 --> 10:29.288
No, you're at
the right house.

10:29.323 --> 10:31.257
I'm his grandniece,
Sandy.

10:31.291 --> 10:33.526
Wow, my name
is Chris, too.

10:33.560 --> 10:36.929
Oh, hey, there, Chris,
happy Valentine's Day.

10:36.964 --> 10:40.500
Hope cupid brings you
a saggy old bag of treats.

10:40.534 --> 10:43.436
Hey, Mr. Herbert, I'm just here
to collect for the newspaper.

10:43.470 --> 10:45.238
Here you go.

10:45.272 --> 10:49.142
Oh, hang now, Chris.
Your fly's up again.

10:49.176 --> 10:50.743
Thanks, Mr. Herbert.

10:53.130 --> 10:55.431
He's so hot.

10:55.465 --> 10:56.833
(sighing):
I'd love to talk to him,

10:56.867 --> 10:58.734
but I just don't know
what I would say.

10:58.769 --> 11:00.770
Oh, I know all
the things to say.

11:00.804 --> 11:02.305
Maybe I can
help you out.

11:02.339 --> 11:03.506
You'd do that for me?

11:03.540 --> 11:04.607
Sure.

11:04.641 --> 11:06.609
Right after my
favorite show.

11:06.643 --> 11:08.077
<i>Coming up next:</i>

11:08.111 --> 11:11.514
To Catch a Predator
Who's Proud of Being a Predator.

11:11.548 --> 11:12.782
Good evening, sir.

11:12.816 --> 11:14.283
I'm Chris Hansen
with <i>Dateline.</i>

11:14.318 --> 11:16.652
Do you know the boy you were
coming here to meet tonight

11:16.687 --> 11:19.021
is only 13 years old?

11:19.056 --> 11:20.556
No, I drove
900 (bleep) miles

11:20.591 --> 11:22.358
for a 14-year-old.

11:25.429 --> 11:27.330
So what seems
to be the trouble?

11:27.364 --> 11:29.015
Dr. Hartman,
something's wrong with me!

11:29.066 --> 11:30.683
Everyone's treating me
like I'm a broad!

11:30.717 --> 11:32.084
I-I don't know
what's going on!

11:32.119 --> 11:34.320
I recognize that
hysterical tone of voice.

11:34.354 --> 11:35.688
Sounds like someone's
having their monthly.

11:35.722 --> 11:38.257
All right, sweetie,
let me just spit on my hand,

11:38.292 --> 11:39.308
and we'll get started.

11:39.326 --> 11:41.360
Ah! Get away from me,
you creep!

11:43.714 --> 11:45.164
(gasps)
My God!

11:45.199 --> 11:47.066
There was nothing wrong
with my mirror!

11:47.100 --> 11:49.819
Everyone sees me as a woman!
Oh, no!

11:49.853 --> 11:52.488
This is the universe giving me
what I deserve

11:52.522 --> 11:54.657
for being such a pig
all the time!

11:54.675 --> 11:57.643
From now on,
I'm gonna do things differently.

11:57.678 --> 11:59.946
Men are jerks!
Let's swear off of them

11:59.980 --> 12:01.464
and find comfort in each other!

12:01.498 --> 12:03.132
Com here, you guys!

12:03.166 --> 12:05.918
(squeals)

12:09.873 --> 12:10.923
So, what's with you?

12:10.958 --> 12:11.958
No Valentine's Day plans?

12:11.992 --> 12:12.992
(scoffs) No.

12:13.026 --> 12:14.510
I've had it
with Valentine's Day.

12:14.544 --> 12:15.928
I'm sick of all of it.

12:15.963 --> 12:17.563
Okay, I'm putting on
my friend hat.

12:17.598 --> 12:18.965
What's the matter?
Let me in.

12:18.999 --> 12:20.399
I don't know.
It's just...

12:20.434 --> 12:22.501
How come it's so hard
to meet the right woman?

12:22.536 --> 12:24.904
I think maybe it's just time
for me to give up.

12:24.955 --> 12:26.756
Come on, Brian.
You can't give up.

12:26.790 --> 12:28.190
Everything could
change in a moment.

12:28.225 --> 12:30.026
That's what happened with
the Kennedy assassination.

12:30.060 --> 12:32.929
I'm sorry, gentlemen.
Despite our best efforts,

12:32.963 --> 12:35.531
the Texas School Book Depository
Awareness Council has failed

12:35.565 --> 12:37.166
in its mission to generate
public awareness

12:37.200 --> 12:38.701
of the Texas School
Book Depository.

12:38.735 --> 12:40.503
So at the end of the day,

12:40.537 --> 12:41.904
we'll be shutting
down operations

12:41.939 --> 12:43.472
and laying
everyone off.

12:43.507 --> 12:46.375
Sir, I think you're
gonna want to see this!

12:46.410 --> 12:49.495
♪ Let's fall in love

12:49.529 --> 12:52.081
♪ Why shouldn't we fall
in love? ♪

12:52.115 --> 12:54.367

12:55.535 --> 12:59.472

13:26.350 --> 13:27.883
Oh, Brian,
there you are.

13:27.918 --> 13:29.184
Look, I've been
thinking about

13:29.202 --> 13:30.219
your situation
with women,

13:30.253 --> 13:32.254
and I believe
I've come up with a way

13:32.289 --> 13:34.457
to get to the source
of the problem. Follow me.

13:34.491 --> 13:35.825
What's going on?

13:37.027 --> 13:38.427
Oh, my God.

13:40.864 --> 13:41.964
Stewie, what the hell?!

13:41.999 --> 13:43.449
These are all
my ex-girlfriends!

13:43.483 --> 13:45.551
Well, I thought they could
provide some insights

13:45.585 --> 13:47.053
that might improve
your love life.

13:47.087 --> 13:48.454
Ladies, as you may have guessed,

13:48.488 --> 13:50.656
you are here
because you have all dated

13:50.691 --> 13:52.258
this great guy.

13:52.292 --> 13:53.893
Yet, somehow, things
didn't work out.

13:53.927 --> 13:56.028
My objective is
to figure out why.

13:56.063 --> 13:57.263
I don't know.

13:57.297 --> 13:58.731
The word "self-absorbed"
comes to mind.

13:58.765 --> 14:00.132
And pretentious.

14:00.167 --> 14:01.133
Definitely pretentious.

14:01.168 --> 14:03.336
And he's got a big eggo.

14:03.370 --> 14:05.237
Okay, we seem
to have a theme going here.

14:05.272 --> 14:06.739
Oh, come on!
You're all just mad

14:06.773 --> 14:08.040
because I didn't
wanna be with you!

14:08.075 --> 14:09.608
(masculine voice): I think Brian's
a wonderful man.

14:09.643 --> 14:11.344
He's just having
a difficult time

14:11.378 --> 14:13.379
coming to terms
with his own sexuality.

14:13.413 --> 14:15.214
Shut up, Ida.
She's my favorite.

14:15.248 --> 14:16.248
He's insecure.

14:16.283 --> 14:17.416
And a blowhard.

14:17.451 --> 14:19.068
And he's got a tiny penis!

14:19.086 --> 14:20.553
(all laughing)

14:20.587 --> 14:22.605
Yeah, that was pretty clear
by the survey.

14:22.639 --> 14:24.106
Okay, now who wants
more wine?

14:24.141 --> 14:25.091
This is great.

14:25.125 --> 14:26.575
We should do this
every Saturday.

14:26.610 --> 14:28.778
No, no, we're not gonna
do this every Saturday!

14:28.812 --> 14:30.346
What's wrong?
We're just being honest.

14:30.380 --> 14:31.797
Oh, oh, you want honest?!

14:31.832 --> 14:33.466
You're an old bag.
You're blind.

14:33.500 --> 14:34.600
Your vomit tastes weird.

14:34.634 --> 14:35.968
You don't even know
why you're here.

14:36.019 --> 14:37.536
You chose to be
on <i>The Hills.</i>

14:37.571 --> 14:39.205
You still have
bits of penis left,

14:39.239 --> 14:40.439
and you can never get wet.

14:40.474 --> 14:41.807
(whines)

14:41.858 --> 14:43.859
And you, you're more
of a woman

14:43.894 --> 14:46.445
than anyone else
in this room!

14:48.949 --> 14:50.316
Get him!

14:58.809 --> 15:02.711
Oh, honey, I'm so excited
to finally meet your girlfriend.

15:02.746 --> 15:03.979
Here she comes now.

15:04.014 --> 15:06.015
Yoo-hoo, baby!

15:06.049 --> 15:07.900
Oh, no!

15:14.058 --> 15:17.527
ANNOUNCER: We now return to <i>Tom & Jerry:</i>
<i>The Final Episode.</i>

15:17.561 --> 15:18.795
So, that's it?
That's it.

15:18.829 --> 15:20.063
This is so much easier.

15:20.097 --> 15:22.165
I don't know why
I didn't do this years ago.

15:22.199 --> 15:24.267
What do you want me
to do with the body?

15:24.301 --> 15:26.236
(scoffs) I don't care.
Throw it in the garbage.

15:26.270 --> 15:28.037
Do you want any
of his oversized mallets?

15:28.072 --> 15:29.439
I <i>will</i> take a mallet.

15:29.473 --> 15:31.040
(phone rings)

15:31.075 --> 15:32.675
Ah, I gotta take this.

15:32.710 --> 15:33.743
Who's calling?

15:33.777 --> 15:35.011
My ex-girlfriend.

15:35.045 --> 15:36.846
She calls me drunk
every Valentine's Day.

15:36.881 --> 15:38.114
Hey, Samantha.

15:38.149 --> 15:41.784
Yeah, yeah, I'm sorry.
I still love Lois.

15:41.819 --> 15:44.154
Oh, come on. You would have
been a great mom.

15:44.188 --> 15:46.089
(whispering): She had cervical cancer
five years ago.

15:46.123 --> 15:48.558
She's basically a boob
on a leg at this point.

15:48.592 --> 15:49.826
Well, that's something.

15:49.860 --> 15:51.427
You're in a book club?

15:51.462 --> 15:53.363
Those are tough
to get into.

15:53.397 --> 15:55.315
What? Well,
I didn't even know

15:55.349 --> 15:57.650
the Fine Young Cannibals
were still together.

15:57.685 --> 15:58.952
Eight-city tour?

15:58.986 --> 16:00.987
Well, I don't know
if I can make eight,

16:01.021 --> 16:02.455
but I can certainly do six.

16:02.489 --> 16:03.456
What <i>about</i> Lois?

16:03.490 --> 16:04.941
She's totally out
of the picture.

16:04.975 --> 16:06.543
We've done everything
but sign the papers.

16:06.577 --> 16:09.045
Samantha, Samantha,
I will see you in Binghamton.

16:09.079 --> 16:11.497
And now I want you to go
and take a picture of yourself

16:11.531 --> 16:13.933
because it will be
your last day alone.

16:13.968 --> 16:15.835
Geez, what's not clear
about "Get lost"?

16:15.870 --> 16:18.404
By the way, my attendance
at home is gonna be spotty

16:18.439 --> 16:19.772
over the next few weeks.

16:22.526 --> 16:26.079
And, well, prize pumpkin
from the county fair,

16:26.113 --> 16:29.949
that's why I'm naming you
my Chief of Police.

16:29.984 --> 16:33.603
Mayor West, there's
something you need to see!

16:37.541 --> 16:41.511
My God! My wife is
seeing another mayor!

16:41.545 --> 16:42.979
I'm sorry, sir.

16:43.013 --> 16:46.499
Don't be. Because
I'm going to win her back.

16:46.533 --> 16:49.969
I trust you'll take care
of things here in my absence.

16:51.255 --> 16:52.655
Officer down!

16:55.509 --> 16:57.527
I hereby declare
this public park

16:57.561 --> 17:01.581
and future homosexual
meeting spot... open!

17:01.615 --> 17:03.900
Unhand that woman,
you bastard!

17:03.934 --> 17:05.568
(gasps) Adam!

17:05.603 --> 17:09.071
Well, well, well, if it isn't
Mayor "Guns For Toys" West.

17:09.106 --> 17:11.674
The chair recognizes
your face!

17:11.709 --> 17:13.726
<i>En garde!</i>

17:18.249 --> 17:19.348
Is the park open?

17:19.383 --> 17:20.700
Not yet!

17:24.922 --> 17:27.390
You call that kissing a baby?!

17:30.811 --> 17:32.562
That's how you kiss a baby.

17:36.784 --> 17:39.819
I hereby declare this
Stabby Eye Day!

17:39.853 --> 17:41.938
(screams)

17:41.989 --> 17:44.674
Oh, Adam, I'm so sorry!

17:44.708 --> 17:46.309
Carol, I love you

17:46.343 --> 17:47.877
and I can't live
without you.

17:47.911 --> 17:50.580
Please, never let this happen
again.

17:50.614 --> 17:51.814
I won't, Adam.

17:51.849 --> 17:55.385
You're the only mayor for me.

17:55.419 --> 17:58.554
Hey-ey, Carol.
I almost didn't recognize you

17:58.589 --> 18:01.457
without my special sauce
all over your face.

18:07.431 --> 18:10.066
Is somebody out there?

18:10.100 --> 18:11.634
Chris, it's me!

18:11.669 --> 18:13.269
Uncle Herbert's
grandniece, Sandy!

18:13.304 --> 18:15.605
Oh, hi, Sandy. What's up?

18:15.639 --> 18:17.273
(hushed):
What do I say?

18:17.308 --> 18:18.941
You say,
"Chris, I wanted

18:18.976 --> 18:21.277
to come see you
because, well..."

18:21.312 --> 18:25.114
Chris, I wanted to come
see you because, well...

18:25.149 --> 18:26.983
I'm kind of a
lonely old man.

18:27.017 --> 18:28.284
Really?

18:28.319 --> 18:31.354
Now, I know I'm not much
to look at,

18:31.388 --> 18:33.256
and ever since I got banned
from the arcade,

18:33.290 --> 18:34.524
I don't know what I'm doing.

18:34.558 --> 18:35.792
But if you're up for it,

18:35.826 --> 18:38.127
I'd like to spend some time
with you.

18:38.162 --> 18:39.746
Okay. Sure, Sandy!

18:39.780 --> 18:41.814
I'll come right down!

18:41.849 --> 18:42.865
Thanks, Uncle Herbert.

18:42.900 --> 18:45.101
I don't know how
I could ever repay you.

18:45.135 --> 18:47.637
Well, there
is one thing.

18:47.671 --> 18:49.589
(both laughing)

18:51.759 --> 18:54.427
Also, if I gave you
a sandwich,

18:54.461 --> 18:57.497
do you think you could
get Chris to fart on it?

19:00.684 --> 19:03.770
Well, guess
I better be going.

19:03.804 --> 19:05.671
I gotta get this heart
to Madonna.

19:05.706 --> 19:08.574
Oh, my God! Madonna needs
a heart transplant?

19:08.609 --> 19:10.543
No, she just doesn't want
other people

19:10.577 --> 19:12.145
to have them
for some reason.

19:12.179 --> 19:14.647
But before I go... Here.

19:14.681 --> 19:17.050
For me?

19:17.084 --> 19:18.534
My kidney!

19:18.569 --> 19:19.936
I wanted you to have it.

19:19.970 --> 19:23.056
Oh, Toby, I love it!
Thank you.

19:23.090 --> 19:25.958
This has been the best
Valentine's Day ever.

19:33.984 --> 19:35.418
Oh, Peter, it was fun

19:35.452 --> 19:37.186
spending the day
in bed with you.

19:37.221 --> 19:38.788
It sure was, Lois.

19:38.822 --> 19:41.023
Happy Valentine's Day.

19:44.411 --> 19:46.679
Hey, Lois,
remember our wedding?

19:46.713 --> 19:48.581
Yeah, I sure do.

19:48.615 --> 19:50.116
Remember the dance?

19:50.150 --> 19:51.684
Of course I do, Peter.

19:51.718 --> 19:53.119
Who was that
half-Persian chick

19:53.153 --> 19:54.587
who was dancing
with your cousin?

19:54.621 --> 19:56.222
I think her name
was Flora.

19:56.256 --> 19:57.323
Yeah... yeah.

19:57.357 --> 19:59.242
Okay, all right,
I'm ready! I'm ready!

19:59.276 --> 20:01.043
What?
Shut up for ten minutes

20:01.078 --> 20:03.379
and pretend we're in the back
behind the speakers.
