00:25.458 --> 00:26.447
What are you doing here?

00:26.526 --> 00:29.654
Looking for proof that what happened
to that limousine wasn't an accident.

00:30.864 --> 00:33.196
Analyze the composition
of this armor plate.

00:33.266 --> 00:35.131
We buy one grade
of armor plate.

00:35.201 --> 00:37.567
Well, someone ordered
a different grade.

00:37.937 --> 00:39.165
We gotta find out who.

00:40.407 --> 00:42.136
He's a cold-blooded killer,
Michael.

00:42.208 --> 00:44.073
You promised these people
a demonstration.

00:44.144 --> 00:45.634
Oh, I can handle it.

01:05.165 --> 01:07.690
Knight Rider,
a shadowy flight...

01:07.767 --> 01:09.735
into the dangerous world
of a man...

01:09.803 --> 01:12.135
who does not exist.

01:20.113 --> 01:22.138
Michael Knight,
a young loner...

01:22.215 --> 01:24.308
on a crusade to champion
the cause of the innocent...

01:24.384 --> 01:26.716
the helpless, the powerless...

01:26.886 --> 01:30.117
in a world of criminals
who operate above the law.

02:34.787 --> 02:37.847
This limousine has a modified
450 horsepower...

02:37.924 --> 02:39.721
turbocharged power plant...

02:39.893 --> 02:41.758
high-speed
racing suspension...

02:41.828 --> 02:44.388
all-terrain
puncture-proof tires, and...

02:44.464 --> 02:47.797
I don't have to tell you gentlemen,
I think, how important that is...

02:47.867 --> 02:50.836
in the areas of the world
today, where you all do business.

02:50.904 --> 02:54.931
International climate has never
been more hostile or threatening.

02:57.777 --> 02:59.768
This obstacle course
simulates...

02:59.846 --> 03:03.145
just about every conceivable
situation you might encounter.

03:03.650 --> 03:05.311
Good. Good.

03:31.377 --> 03:32.935
All right, stand by.

03:38.618 --> 03:40.279
Control rank.

03:40.353 --> 03:42.184
Activate land mines.

03:58.705 --> 04:02.607
Now, what you're seeing here, gentlemen,
is state-of-the-art maneuverability...

04:02.675 --> 04:04.302
for tactical evasion.

04:04.844 --> 04:05.902
Yes, you're right.

04:05.979 --> 04:09.244
None of the other vehicles we've
seen so far are competitive.

04:09.315 --> 04:13.251
And, of course, the LXAP does this
with no sacrifice in range or comfort.

04:13.419 --> 04:14.977
Very impressive.

04:23.196 --> 04:24.185
What is that?

04:24.264 --> 04:26.459
That's the
Armorbuilt UTC 1200.

04:26.532 --> 04:28.557
It's the ultimate
in urban terrorist control.

04:28.635 --> 04:30.865
We use
the armament package...

04:30.937 --> 04:33.303
in the next part of our
demonstration, gentlemen.

04:33.373 --> 04:35.102
You about ready, Hank?

04:37.410 --> 04:38.900
We're up to speed.

04:39.045 --> 04:40.342
Any time, Gene.

04:43.216 --> 04:45.946
The XLAP's protection
package...

04:46.019 --> 04:49.921
employs the cutting edge of
structural technology and material.

04:50.156 --> 04:51.987
Steel-magnesium alloy...

04:52.058 --> 04:55.494
forty-five millimeters thick,
case-hardened armor plates...

04:55.695 --> 04:58.892
and flame-treated
bullet-proof glass throughout.

04:59.599 --> 05:01.760
All right,
commence weapons assault.

05:06.739 --> 05:10.539
And what's coming next, gentlemen,
will demonstrate beyond any doubt...

05:11.110 --> 05:13.237
you're all making
the right choice.

05:15.448 --> 05:17.575
Stand by, launch when ready.

06:54.380 --> 06:58.817
I love the Big Apple, but it sure
feels good to be back on the road again.

06:59.118 --> 07:00.608
I agree, Michael.

07:00.686 --> 07:03.484
If I never see the Big Apple
again, it'll be too soon.

07:03.556 --> 07:05.751
Those streets
have more potholes...

07:05.825 --> 07:07.486
than Devon has neckties.

07:08.895 --> 07:10.658
Did I hear my name mentioned?

07:10.730 --> 07:12.891
Yo, Devon! Good Morning.

07:12.999 --> 07:14.626
There you are, Michael.

07:14.767 --> 07:17.895
I understand things
in Manhattan went very well.

07:18.738 --> 07:20.330
By the way, Michael...

07:20.406 --> 07:22.237
"By the way, Michael"?

07:23.342 --> 07:26.106
Why do I feel like
I'm being set up, here?

07:26.612 --> 07:28.978
Well, there is one thing
I'd like you to cover.

07:29.048 --> 07:31.380
Because I am being set up.

07:31.451 --> 07:33.783
Just a little detour,
that's all...

07:33.853 --> 07:35.684
a minor course adjustment...

07:35.855 --> 07:37.789
to Armorbuilt Carriage Works.

07:37.857 --> 07:40.519
Mel Mitchell, one of the
employees, is expecting you...

07:40.593 --> 07:43.585
and this is a matter that
may well merit our scrutiny.

07:43.930 --> 07:45.659
Devon.
Good luck, Michael.

07:48.634 --> 07:51.000
"Merit our scrutiny"?

08:22.502 --> 08:23.594
Excuse me.

08:24.670 --> 08:25.762
Excuse me.

08:34.413 --> 08:37.177
Mel, could I have a word
with you, please?

08:39.852 --> 08:42.878
Well, it's not short
for Melvin, is it?

08:43.121 --> 08:45.454
Melanie.
Michael. Michael Knight.

08:47.493 --> 08:50.155
Oh, from the Foundation. Yes,
Devon told me all about you.

08:50.229 --> 08:52.356
Yeah,
that's one of his bad habits.

08:52.965 --> 08:54.796
You do all the armor plating
around here?

08:54.867 --> 08:55.856
Sure do.

08:56.035 --> 08:58.060
Would you hand me
the number five file?

08:58.137 --> 09:00.332
It's my department.
Other file.

09:01.774 --> 09:04.140
Got my degree
in structural engineering.

09:05.878 --> 09:09.678
Found out I was a damn good
engineer, but a lousy desk jockey...

09:09.782 --> 09:12.216
and here I am.
Everybody always asks.

09:12.318 --> 09:14.115
It's easy to see why.

09:15.388 --> 09:17.379
Someplace we can go and talk?

09:17.456 --> 09:19.287
Sure, just give me a minute.

09:24.230 --> 09:28.291
The missile just penetrated the
limo door. I couldn't believe it.

09:28.467 --> 09:29.957
I still can't.

09:31.571 --> 09:32.629
Wow.

09:33.339 --> 09:37.070
I decided we've come too far to
have it taken away from us now.

09:37.343 --> 09:39.504
That's when I called
Devon Miles.

09:39.579 --> 09:41.638
Wait a minute,
you're losing me here.

09:41.714 --> 09:43.944
Who's come too far,
and for what?

09:44.317 --> 09:47.150
Oh, I'm sorry. I thought
Devon explained it to you.

09:47.253 --> 09:49.881
Armorbuilt was filing
for bankruptcy.

09:50.122 --> 09:53.421
Really hit us hard, all
the people who work here.

09:53.759 --> 09:56.387
So, I came up with an idea,
an alternative:

09:57.196 --> 09:58.686
an employee buy-out.

09:59.065 --> 10:02.796
I got you. All the employees kick
in, re-negotiate with the creditors...

10:02.868 --> 10:05.166
then you guys end up
owning the company.

10:05.237 --> 10:06.499
Sounds like a plan.

10:06.572 --> 10:08.563
It was,
until the limo accident.

10:08.808 --> 10:10.673
Cost the company a major sale.

10:11.844 --> 10:14.870
We needed that
to finance the buy-out.

10:17.516 --> 10:18.574
Mel...

10:19.452 --> 10:22.250
do you think somebody
purposely caused the accident?

10:22.321 --> 10:24.289
All our vehicles
are designed to withstand...

10:24.357 --> 10:26.848
twice the explosive force
used on the track.

10:26.926 --> 10:28.018
What do you think?

10:29.662 --> 10:31.926
I think it may merit
our scrutiny.

10:31.998 --> 10:33.090
Excuse me?

10:33.199 --> 10:35.360
I think we should
take another look.

10:35.601 --> 10:38.695
Well, the group's getting together
at lunch today to discuss our options.

10:38.771 --> 10:40.568
And I don't have any plans.

10:40.840 --> 10:42.432
Do you mind if I join you?

10:42.508 --> 10:43.497
Please.

10:43.809 --> 10:44.833
Okay.

10:45.544 --> 10:47.068
We love you, Mel, but...

10:47.146 --> 10:49.512
maybe you've already given us
all the help we can handle.

10:49.582 --> 10:51.846
We know you meant well, but
frankly, if it wasn't for you...

10:51.917 --> 10:54.909
we wouldn't be in this mess right
now, with our savings in jeopardy...

10:54.987 --> 10:56.215
and our houses mortgaged.

10:56.288 --> 10:59.485
That's right. The buy-out's
finished, Mel, okay? Forget it.

10:59.558 --> 11:03.551
From what Mel told me, you guys were
okay until you lost that foreign sale.

11:03.929 --> 11:05.556
What if we get it back?

11:05.965 --> 11:08.229
It's a long shot,
but we should try.

11:08.467 --> 11:11.265
We all got into this buy-out
because we had something to gain...

11:11.337 --> 11:13.805
something good. We still do.

11:14.006 --> 11:16.804
Look, we all want
to better our lives.

11:16.876 --> 11:18.867
That hot car you were
talking about buying, Eddie...

11:18.944 --> 11:20.206
you ready to give up on that?

11:20.279 --> 11:24.010
No way. I got my eye on one
right now. How about you, Hank?

11:24.383 --> 11:28.114
You and Alice ready to cancel that
second honeymoon you've been planning?

11:28.187 --> 11:31.350
Hey, after living with him for 20
years, you really think she'll go?

11:32.491 --> 11:34.391
The way Mel described
your buy-out plan...

11:34.460 --> 11:37.088
it sounds like the chance
of a lifetime to me.

11:37.163 --> 11:40.098
You save your jobs here, you
buy into a piece of the company.

11:40.166 --> 11:41.758
Come on, what about that?

11:41.834 --> 11:43.995
You guys ready to give up
without a fight?

11:44.070 --> 11:45.867
That's easy for you to say.

11:45.938 --> 11:46.927
You got an idea?

11:47.006 --> 11:50.965
Yeah, somebody's got to turn that
foreign sale around before it's too late.

11:51.043 --> 11:53.534
Okay, you got anyone
particular in mind?

11:58.417 --> 12:00.044
How about you, Michael?

12:05.057 --> 12:07.423
we have no driver.

12:07.493 --> 12:09.984
I mean, let's say we get those
buyers back for another demo...

12:10.062 --> 12:12.053
who's going to give it to
them? Who's going to drive?

12:12.131 --> 12:14.929
That's right. Who's going to be crazy
enough to go out on that track...

12:15.000 --> 12:16.831
after what's
already happened?

12:16.902 --> 12:18.164
I might.

12:19.505 --> 12:21.063
Well...

12:22.708 --> 12:25.074
we're talking about
a high degree of skill here.

12:25.144 --> 12:27.669
I mean, just because you talk
a good game...

12:27.880 --> 12:29.905
it doesn't mean you can drive,
now, does it?

12:29.982 --> 12:31.882
Doesn't mean
I can't, either.

12:31.951 --> 12:33.009
Try me.

12:33.753 --> 12:35.015
Boy, that's typical.

12:35.087 --> 12:38.386
Give a guy a hot-looking car, he
thinks he's the next Parnelli Jones.

12:38.457 --> 12:39.481
I'll tell you what...

12:39.558 --> 12:42.527
you want to take that freeway flyer
of yours out there right now...

12:42.595 --> 12:44.529
make a fool out of yourself...

12:44.730 --> 12:46.527
you be my guest, all right?

12:56.509 --> 12:57.908
Okay, let's look good, pal.

12:57.977 --> 12:59.604
There's a lot riding
on this one.

12:59.678 --> 13:01.771
Michael, I always look good.

13:01.881 --> 13:04.850
You'll get no argument
from me. Let's do it.

13:20.266 --> 13:22.097
What a set of wheels!

13:22.368 --> 13:23.733
That guy's a hotdog.

13:23.803 --> 13:26.704
Who cares? He's the key to
keeping the buy-out alive.

13:57.469 --> 13:58.527
He's good.

14:05.544 --> 14:07.444
I think that got
their attention, Michael.

14:07.513 --> 14:08.980
Okay, pal.

14:09.081 --> 14:10.912
Now, lets go get the job.

14:23.863 --> 14:25.728
That's nice.

14:27.666 --> 14:30.499
I think we found our driver.
You bet.

14:30.569 --> 14:32.594
Well, if that's an offer,
I accept.

14:32.671 --> 14:34.298
What a car.

14:34.673 --> 14:37.904
I'll tell you what, Mel, you take
the driver, I'll take the car.

14:37.977 --> 14:39.672
Say, how much this puppy
set me back?

14:39.745 --> 14:42.475
I'm sorry, but this "puppy"
is not for sale.

14:42.548 --> 14:45.039
Look, I can't haggle with you
now, but when old Eddie Deskey...

14:45.117 --> 14:47.017
makes up his mind
to get something...

14:47.086 --> 14:49.077
I'll be coming to you again.

14:49.688 --> 14:51.485
You see that car?

14:53.392 --> 14:56.327
I think this is gonna work.
Right on.

14:58.163 --> 15:00.188
I suppose the buy-out
is on now.

15:01.200 --> 15:02.724
Lilah, not now.

15:04.403 --> 15:08.464
I say we pack up, head for Europe now
and let them have the damn company.

15:08.641 --> 15:11.269
Come on, what are you...
I can't do that.

15:11.343 --> 15:15.143
I mean, it took me years to pull that
money and get it out of the country.

15:15.214 --> 15:18.377
And I got a bankruptcy set up,
I get into a buy-out instead.

15:18.450 --> 15:20.611
Could lose everything.
Now, you know that.

15:20.686 --> 15:22.813
So, just don't push me,
all right?

15:23.022 --> 15:26.389
If I don't push you, you'll
still be here six months from now.

15:26.525 --> 15:28.015
Let me tell you something,
Gene...

15:28.093 --> 15:31.119
I've been hanging around
this grease pit for two years.

15:31.196 --> 15:33.096
I'm tired of playing
sales director...

15:33.165 --> 15:36.896
and making believe I'm into
those over-priced toys of yours.

15:37.436 --> 15:39.563
Boy, you could've fooled me,
Lilah.

15:40.706 --> 15:43.004
I thought you handled it
pretty well...

15:43.309 --> 15:47.040
especially when you heard about the
money and the villa in St. Moritz.

15:48.647 --> 15:50.877
A lot of men
have money, Gene.

15:51.417 --> 15:54.545
Armorbuilt has proven
a perfect place to meet them.

15:54.853 --> 15:56.582
Would it surprise you
that some of our clients...

15:56.655 --> 15:59.146
have expressed more
than a casual interest?

16:06.765 --> 16:09.256
Get it together fast,
or I'm gone.

16:14.006 --> 16:15.303
I'll handle it.

16:17.576 --> 16:19.510
Just give me one extra day,
all right?

16:19.578 --> 16:20.909
You're out of days.

16:20.980 --> 16:23.505
Twenty-four hours, Lilah.
That's all I need.

16:26.352 --> 16:29.879
And this Michael Knight,
hotshot...

16:31.857 --> 16:33.791
his first test run
tomorrow...

16:34.093 --> 16:35.492
will be his last.

16:35.894 --> 16:37.384
I promise you.

16:54.780 --> 16:56.714
Why are we going
to see these buyers...

16:56.782 --> 16:57.840
before making certain...

16:57.916 --> 17:00.077
what happened to the limousine
wasn't an accident?

17:00.152 --> 17:02.279
Well, because they're
checking out today.

17:02.354 --> 17:06.154
It's our only chance to convince
them to stick around for another demo.

17:06.290 --> 17:09.021
What's our ETA?
Four minutes, 37 seconds.

17:09.094 --> 17:11.324
You know, Michael,
while we have a few moments...

17:11.396 --> 17:14.093
do you recall that fellow
who wanted to buy me?

17:14.165 --> 17:15.758
Sure.
Did he make you an offer?

17:15.834 --> 17:18.358
No, Michael, we never
got to the bidding stage.

17:18.436 --> 17:20.200
That's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

17:20.271 --> 17:21.329
Me?

17:22.107 --> 17:25.873
KITT, I can't put a price on you.
I wouldn't even know where to begin.

17:25.978 --> 17:28.879
Well, what if we were
in deep-snow country...

17:28.947 --> 17:31.313
our adversaries
dynamited the road...

17:31.383 --> 17:34.409
the explosion set off
a massive avalanche...

17:34.486 --> 17:38.252
we're buried under tons of ice
and snow, we have no food...

17:38.323 --> 17:40.348
you haven't slept in two days,
and...

17:40.426 --> 17:41.450
Can I have Mel with me?

17:41.527 --> 17:43.358
I want to know my worth.

17:43.429 --> 17:46.159
What must I do to get
a serious answer out of you?

17:46.231 --> 17:47.698
Try being serious.

17:47.800 --> 17:50.360
All right, Michael, you're
trapped in a burning building.

17:50.436 --> 17:52.927
The flames are raging
all around you.

17:53.005 --> 17:55.098
The smoke is so thick,
you can't see.

17:55.174 --> 17:58.041
I am outside ready to
spring into action, and...

17:58.110 --> 17:59.941
KITT. KITT. KITT. KITT...

18:00.279 --> 18:04.545
not now.
Maybe later, but not now.

18:08.153 --> 18:09.518
There are the buyers, buddy.

18:09.588 --> 18:11.783
Looks like
they're leaving right now.

18:14.660 --> 18:16.753
Not a nanosecond too soon,
Michael.

18:16.829 --> 18:18.091
KITT...

18:18.397 --> 18:20.262
let's micro jam
that trunk lock.

18:26.371 --> 18:27.895
Excuse me, gentlemen...

18:27.973 --> 18:29.565
you folks seem to be having
a problem here.

18:29.641 --> 18:31.233
Well, we're on our way
to the airport.

18:31.310 --> 18:33.141
The driver seems to have
trouble with the lock.

18:33.212 --> 18:34.236
We may miss our flight.

18:34.313 --> 18:37.009
Well, my name is Michael Knight.
I know a little bit about locks.

18:37.082 --> 18:38.811
Maybe I can fix it
for you.

18:38.951 --> 18:43.047
But, before I do, I'd like to talk
to you gentlemen about limousines.

18:43.522 --> 18:47.390
You see, you found the one you
wanted at Armorbuilt yesterday...

18:47.493 --> 18:49.393
but someone didn't want you
to have it.

18:49.461 --> 18:51.190
The vehicle was sabotaged.

18:51.563 --> 18:53.793
Do you have any proof of this?
Not yet.

18:53.866 --> 18:57.097
Mr. Knight, if you have no proof,
I think we're all wasting our time.

18:57.169 --> 18:58.659
I cannot help you.
I'm sorry.

18:58.737 --> 19:00.364
We're not just talking about
me here.

19:00.439 --> 19:02.634
We're talking about
a lot of people.

19:02.708 --> 19:05.176
Hard-working people,
expert technicians...

19:05.244 --> 19:07.542
proud people who put their
life savings on the line...

19:07.613 --> 19:09.808
to save their jobs
and their company.

19:10.149 --> 19:13.983
It turns out that your sale would have
put these people in the driver's seat.

19:14.052 --> 19:17.920
All I'm asking is for you gentlemen
to give these people another chance.

19:18.357 --> 19:19.381
Please.

19:20.259 --> 19:23.524
We are due in Detroit tomorrow
for a competitor's demonstration.

19:23.595 --> 19:24.960
It's impossible.

19:25.964 --> 19:27.090
Is it, Hans?

19:27.299 --> 19:29.631
I found Mr. Knight's words
touching.

19:29.735 --> 19:31.362
I'm surprised you didn't.

19:31.436 --> 19:33.802
I have a business to run.

19:33.872 --> 19:35.339
Yes, Hans, we know.

19:36.074 --> 19:39.475
You see, Mr. Knight, though my
colleague possesses great wealth...

19:39.545 --> 19:41.137
he began with nothing.

19:41.346 --> 19:45.077
He knows what it is like to
struggle, to sweat, to build a...

19:45.484 --> 19:48.510
Enough, please.
No history tale.

19:50.022 --> 19:52.217
All right, Mr. Knight...

19:52.591 --> 19:54.525
schedule your demonstration.

19:54.593 --> 19:56.788
Terrific,
we'll be in touch.

19:58.330 --> 19:59.388
Allow me.

20:05.837 --> 20:07.566
You know, Michael,
it occurred to me...

20:07.639 --> 20:10.608
that these low-profile
information-gathering missions...

20:10.676 --> 20:13.008
are the ultimate test
of our abilities, aren't they?

20:13.078 --> 20:14.739
You better believe it, pal.

20:14.813 --> 20:17.543
I got a feeling that checking
out this limo at Armorbuilt...

20:17.616 --> 20:20.016
is going to be a very valuable
night's work.

20:20.085 --> 20:23.248
I agree,
and keeping value in mind...

20:23.322 --> 20:26.985
what if we're in the desert,
in a sand storm...

20:27.059 --> 20:29.254
there's no water
for miles around...

20:29.328 --> 20:33.389
and you're being chased by a band
of sword-waving camel drivers...

20:33.632 --> 20:35.327
what would I be worth?

20:35.867 --> 20:37.528
I'd have to say...

20:38.270 --> 20:39.328
priceless.

20:39.404 --> 20:43.272
You know, lately, I get the feeling
you enjoy answering my questions...

20:43.342 --> 20:45.242
without really answering them.

20:45.310 --> 20:47.904
Am I right or am I wrong?
Yes.

21:07.099 --> 21:09.567
All right, KITT,
keep your scanner peeled.

21:09.735 --> 21:12.397
How are you getting in?
I'm going to pick the lock.

21:12.471 --> 21:14.098
That's illegal, Michael.

21:14.172 --> 21:15.935
So is the way we parked.

21:16.008 --> 21:18.533
I'll take care of
the silent alarm, Michael.

21:40.966 --> 21:42.558
KITT?
Yes, Michael?

21:42.834 --> 21:46.031
Looks like they've beaten us
to it, partner. The door's gone.

21:46.104 --> 21:48.732
What are you going to do now?

21:48.907 --> 21:50.135
Find it.

22:02.854 --> 22:06.153
Do me a favor, will you, and
run a chemical scan of the area?

22:06.425 --> 22:09.394
Look for compounds left by
a warhead after it detonates.

22:13.332 --> 22:15.232
I'm picking up
a high concentration...

22:15.300 --> 22:16.927
in that area above you.

22:39.991 --> 22:42.585
You want this one, partner?
Allow me.

22:48.367 --> 22:49.425
Beautiful.

23:07.285 --> 23:08.684
All right, KITT...

23:08.787 --> 23:11.312
analyze the composition
of this armor plate.

23:11.623 --> 23:14.023
Compare it to
technical specifications.

23:18.997 --> 23:21.124
The material in question
is of the proper thickness...

23:21.199 --> 23:23.827
but has a highly porous
molecular structure.

23:24.069 --> 23:28.165
I'm getting a density-hardness reading
barely one-fourth the grade specified.

23:28.907 --> 23:32.274
Well, that sure explains
why the missile pierced it.

23:40.819 --> 23:44.186
Michael, my scanners are indicating
someone else is on the premises.

23:44.256 --> 23:45.280
Thanks.

24:06.778 --> 24:07.938
Hey!

24:12.250 --> 24:13.740
What's going on here, Hank?

24:13.819 --> 24:16.447
I came back to check out the
limousine for tomorrow's demo...

24:16.521 --> 24:17.886
and I found him
sneaking around.

24:17.956 --> 24:20.857
You always shoot first
and ask questions later?

24:20.926 --> 24:24.293
what are you doing here?

24:24.429 --> 24:27.956
Looking for proof that what happened
to that limousine wasn't an accident.

24:28.033 --> 24:30.126
What are you talking about?
That's ridiculous.

24:30.202 --> 24:32.170
There was a thorough
investigation.

24:32.237 --> 24:35.035
The armor plate in the door of
that limousine was so below spec...

24:35.106 --> 24:37.267
you could use it
to wrap sandwiches.

24:37.342 --> 24:40.277
That's a powerful accusation.
Ease up, Gene.

24:40.345 --> 24:43.337
He hasn't proved a thing.
He's a driver...

24:43.482 --> 24:46.508
he's got a gas tank for a brain,
and a tail pipe for a mouth.

24:46.585 --> 24:47.574
That's right.

24:47.652 --> 24:50.985
And I've been behind the wheel long
enough to know when I'm on the right track.

24:51.056 --> 24:52.853
You trying to
say something?

24:53.258 --> 24:54.486
I just did.

25:03.568 --> 25:06.036
You can't exist on a couple
of hours' sleep, Michael.

25:06.104 --> 25:07.435
No choice, pal.

25:07.506 --> 25:09.838
I gotta talk to Mel
about that armor plate.

25:09.908 --> 25:11.842
We buy one grade
of armor plate...

25:11.910 --> 25:13.605
from Blacksteel Fabricators.

25:13.678 --> 25:15.475
We use it on
all our vehicles.

25:15.547 --> 25:19.244
Well, someone ordered a different
grade. We gotta find out who.

25:19.484 --> 25:23.580
Maybe we're going too far with
all this. Suppose it doesn't work?

25:23.688 --> 25:26.316
What if the buyers come back
and we still don't make the sale?

25:26.391 --> 25:29.588
Mel, we're turning this thing around
here. I thought you'd be excited.

25:29.661 --> 25:31.185
I am, Michael.

25:31.663 --> 25:35.030
I don't mean to appear
ungrateful. It's just that...

25:37.035 --> 25:38.502
I don't know.

25:47.879 --> 25:50.439
It's not that
I'm afraid for myself...

25:51.316 --> 25:52.908
it's the others.

25:53.852 --> 25:57.481
In the beginning, when it looked
like we didn't have a chance...

25:57.556 --> 25:59.888
I was the one
who kept it alive.

25:59.958 --> 26:02.051
I built up their hopes.
I feel responsible.

26:02.127 --> 26:06.086
You did those people a favor.
And, believe me, they know it.

26:08.833 --> 26:11.233
What if it all
comes apart again?

26:11.603 --> 26:14.037
I'm here to make sure
that it doesn't.

26:18.944 --> 26:21.606
Devon, what I need to know is,
who ordered that steel...

26:21.680 --> 26:23.341
from Blacksteel Fabricators.

26:23.415 --> 26:26.612
I'll put Bonnie on it right away.
What will you be doing in the meantime?

26:26.685 --> 26:30.485
Well, I'll be demonstrating a
limousine for a group of buyers.

26:30.789 --> 26:34.316
If Armorbuilt makes the sale, the
employee buy-out's still alive.

26:34.392 --> 26:35.450
I see.

26:35.527 --> 26:37.586
You know, Michael,
I seem to recall asking you...

26:37.662 --> 26:39.960
to evaluate the case
at Armorbuilt...

26:40.231 --> 26:42.165
not take over the
employee's buy-out program.

26:42.233 --> 26:44.861
Well, it's hard to do one without
getting involved in the other.

26:44.936 --> 26:49.566
Oh, I had a suspicion that Mel
Mitchell might have that effect on you.

26:49.641 --> 26:53.202
You know, Devon, it also occurred to me
that this might not be the first limousine...

26:53.278 --> 26:56.304
to come off Hanson's assembly
line with inferior armor.

26:56.448 --> 27:00.885
Are you thinking a review of his past
clients' well-being might be in order?

27:00.952 --> 27:03.420
That's exactly
what I'm thinking.

27:27.278 --> 27:29.508
All right,
the run's set for 10:00.

27:29.581 --> 27:32.607
Give me a complete structure
analysis of the limousine.

27:33.118 --> 27:35.348
Start with the driver's door.

27:36.721 --> 27:39.656
Hey, you got a minute
to do some negotiating?

27:42.427 --> 27:44.327
I certainly do, Eddie.

27:46.564 --> 27:48.054
Son of a gun.

27:49.300 --> 27:51.928
That's a great intercom
you got there.

27:52.270 --> 27:56.730
Listen, you do some serious
thinking about what I said yesterday?

27:59.911 --> 28:01.469
Mr. Knight...

28:01.579 --> 28:05.743
I'm afraid we'll be starting a
little sooner than we had anticipated.

28:05.817 --> 28:07.011
Sooner?

28:07.485 --> 28:09.043
The test was scheduled
for 10:00.

28:09.120 --> 28:11.145
You promised these people
a demonstration.

28:11.222 --> 28:13.782
Well, I know that, but I
wanted to walk the track first.

28:13.858 --> 28:15.951
Are you saying you can't
handle it, Mr. Knight?

28:16.027 --> 28:17.358
Oh, I can handle it.

28:25.403 --> 28:27.633
Well, I'm a little gun-shy,
see...

28:27.706 --> 28:30.800
'cause my financing hinges on
this buy-out deal going through.

28:30.875 --> 28:34.311
I understand, Eddie, but as
a very wise fellow once said.

28:34.379 --> 28:36.904
"Bid now,
or forever hold your peace. "

28:37.048 --> 28:39.482
I'm used to dealing
face-to-face...

28:39.551 --> 28:42.611
but, assuming that
this buy-out deal does work...

28:43.021 --> 28:45.387
what would you say to...
KITT, you there?

28:45.457 --> 28:46.788
I'm right here, Michael.

28:46.858 --> 28:49.326
KITT,
they moved up the test time.

28:49.427 --> 28:50.689
I'm just about
on the track now.

28:50.762 --> 28:52.753
I'll accelerate
my computations.

29:22.026 --> 29:24.722
KITT, how's it coming?
I'm working on it, Michael.

29:24.796 --> 29:26.354
Make it fast, buddy.

30:24.155 --> 30:25.383
Prepare to launch.

30:27.392 --> 30:30.828
Michael, my analysis indicates
the armor plate in the door...

30:30.895 --> 30:33.887
is the same inferior grade
I tested last night.

30:33.965 --> 30:37.230
You keep your scanner peeled
for a missile launch.

30:43.842 --> 30:46.072
ETA to impact. 2.3 seconds.

30:46.144 --> 30:49.113
Can you override the guidance
system? Not enough time.

31:01.626 --> 31:04.959
That's what I call tactical
maneuverability. Incredible!

31:05.029 --> 31:07.623
Incredible, an incredible
evasive reaction.

31:07.799 --> 31:10.893
Whoa, we cut that very close.
I know, Michael.

31:11.002 --> 31:13.334
We sure showed them
what this limousine can do.

31:20.645 --> 31:22.579
Incredible performance.

31:29.888 --> 31:30.946
Pretty close, huh?

31:31.022 --> 31:33.149
A most remarkable
demonstration, Mr. Knight.

31:33.224 --> 31:35.089
Thank you, sir.
It was.

31:35.593 --> 31:39.256
And all your demonstrations seem
to have surprise endings these days.

31:39.364 --> 31:41.093
You gentlemen ready
to do some business?

31:41.165 --> 31:44.566
Well, I suppose some
discussion will be in order.

31:44.769 --> 31:48.432
Perhaps we should consider obtaining
one of these urban control vehicles...

31:48.506 --> 31:51.407
along with the limousine.
Good, but...

31:51.542 --> 31:54.670
under the circumstances, maybe
we should discuss it in my office.

31:54.746 --> 31:56.441
Excuse me, please.

31:57.582 --> 32:00.676
You gentlemen are familiar with
the Armorbuilt ironclad guarantee...

32:00.752 --> 32:01.810
I presume?

32:01.886 --> 32:05.879
Certainly, that's the
specification package we received.

32:05.957 --> 32:08.653
Good. And if I were you, I
would want to be dealing with...

32:08.726 --> 32:11.024
the new people
who'll be backing it up.

32:11.396 --> 32:12.454
New people?

32:12.530 --> 32:14.020
Yes, sir.
You're looking at one of them.

32:14.098 --> 32:16.999
Now, if you'll follow
me, please. All right.

32:17.068 --> 32:19.229
What I can do, is this...

32:19.938 --> 32:23.738
Okay, big fellow, snap on
your intercom, and hear this.

32:24.442 --> 32:27.502
All right, that was a pretty nifty
move you put on me before, and I...

32:27.578 --> 32:30.046
Would you explain what you're
implying by that, Eddie?

32:30.114 --> 32:33.811
You set me up! You got me to the
point of making an offer and then...

32:34.619 --> 32:35.881
slammed the door on me!

32:35.954 --> 32:37.478
Now, I hope you don't pull
that again.

32:37.555 --> 32:41.150
On the contrary, I am extremely
interested in what you have to say.

32:41.392 --> 32:45.385
Well, all right. Now we are
starting to talk business.

32:49.200 --> 32:50.861
Michael, how'd it go?
Terrific.

32:50.935 --> 32:53.028
99 % sure they're going
with Armorbuilt.

32:53.104 --> 32:54.401
Great, we can get it all
together now.

32:54.472 --> 32:55.769
What are you trying to pull,
Knight?

32:55.840 --> 32:57.569
The buy-out's back on.

33:01.579 --> 33:04.412
I can't wait to tell my fellow
stock-holders the good news.

33:04.482 --> 33:06.814
Maybe you should hold off
on that one.

33:07.452 --> 33:11.354
Those buyers didn't exactly
say 99 %. More like 49 %.

33:11.756 --> 33:14.156
They still want to check out
that one other company.

33:14.225 --> 33:17.922
Then why'd you say that? To
put some pressure on Hanson.

33:18.196 --> 33:20.858
See, I'm betting he's the one
who's been using low-grade armor...

33:20.932 --> 33:23.696
to screw up your sales demonstrations.
But why would he do that?

33:23.768 --> 33:26.896
To stop the buy-out, Mel.
That's what happened, isn't it?

33:31.442 --> 33:34.377
You mean he killed one
of our drivers to stop it?

33:34.512 --> 33:37.174
Mel, he just tried it
out there again.

33:37.548 --> 33:41.780
Now, if I'm right, I just forced him to
make another move, and when he does it...

33:41.853 --> 33:44.048
believe me, we'll nail him.

33:47.725 --> 33:51.388
That's it, Gene. I've had it. I'm
not having any more to do with this.

33:51.462 --> 33:53.259
By tonight, neither am I.
I've got it figured.

33:53.331 --> 33:54.559
I know just
what I'm going to do.

33:54.632 --> 33:58.159
I'm tired of hearing that.
I'm tired of you. Count me out.

33:58.236 --> 33:59.999
Lilah, now, listen to me.

34:00.104 --> 34:03.039
You gotta trust me. We're
leaving for Switzerland tonight.

34:03.107 --> 34:05.541
All we have to do...
All you have to do.

34:05.610 --> 34:07.874
Get it done,
and pick me up here.

34:08.413 --> 34:11.473
If you're not back in an hour,
I'm checking out of my penthouse...

34:11.549 --> 34:13.540
and I'm heading
for the airport.

34:13.918 --> 34:15.545
One hour.

34:21.659 --> 34:25.425
You know something, that intercom
sure changes the sound of your voice.

34:25.496 --> 34:26.793
You're getting off the track,
Eddie.

34:26.864 --> 34:30.163
I believe you were about to
make me an offer I can't refuse.

34:30.234 --> 34:32.668
Right. What would you say to...

34:32.737 --> 34:34.670
Excuse me, there, buddy.
Hi...

34:35.005 --> 34:36.598
We were gonna...

34:36.674 --> 34:39.438
Like, just now,
we were talking, you know...

34:40.445 --> 34:42.675
and I'm not done talking yet!

34:42.746 --> 34:46.581
That fellow just refuses to give
up, Michael. Not now. Get me Devon.

34:46.650 --> 34:51.110
He seems intent on acquiring
my services in perpetuity and...

34:51.188 --> 34:53.350
KITT.
Well, I was just wondering...

34:53.424 --> 34:56.291
if we were trapped
in the bowels of the earth...

34:56.360 --> 34:59.352
just prior to
an underground nuclear test...

34:59.497 --> 35:01.931
We wouldn't have to worry,
all right?

35:02.033 --> 35:04.263
Now, please, get me Devon.

35:04.368 --> 35:06.495
Michael, I was just about
to contact you.

35:06.571 --> 35:10.371
Devon. You got anything for me on
who ordered that low-grade steel?

35:10.441 --> 35:12.966
Yes, and thanks
to your suggestion...

35:13.044 --> 35:16.844
we've also got some data on Mr. Hanson
that you may find most enlightening.

35:16.914 --> 35:20.145
Bonnie is on her way to meet you at
the semi, to give you the details.

35:20.218 --> 35:21.515
Terrific.

35:39.370 --> 35:40.564
You were right, Michael.

35:40.638 --> 35:42.663
Every one of those
Blacksteel purchase orders...

35:42.740 --> 35:44.765
Was signed by Eugene Hanson.

35:44.842 --> 35:46.867
Well, more than one of
Hanson's past clients...

35:46.944 --> 35:48.673
didn't get the protection
they paid for.

35:48.746 --> 35:50.941
I cross-checked a list
of Armorbuilt clients...

35:51.015 --> 35:52.710
against global
assassination attempts...

35:52.783 --> 35:54.307
Don't tell me...

35:54.385 --> 35:57.684
a lot of the targets were
killed in Armorbuilt limousines.

35:58.322 --> 36:00.483
Too many for it to be
coincidental.

36:00.558 --> 36:03.857
Devon checked his international
contacts, and word is...

36:03.995 --> 36:07.294
Hanson's been taking massive
payoff from radical factions...

36:07.365 --> 36:11.859
To install low-grade armor in the vehicles
he supplies to the people on the hit list.

36:12.937 --> 36:14.199
You got it.

36:14.505 --> 36:18.532
He's on my list now. He's a
cold-blooded killer, Michael.

36:18.609 --> 36:20.474
"Be careful," I know.

36:20.545 --> 36:23.378
With somebody like Hanson,
that may not be enough.

36:29.487 --> 36:32.422
So, $25,000, Mel.

36:34.058 --> 36:36.288
$25,000 for what?

36:36.360 --> 36:39.056
You're the sparkplug
behind this buy-out, right?

36:39.197 --> 36:41.529
You started it, you pull out,
it's over.

36:41.599 --> 36:44.033
Why?
It's none of your concern.

36:44.702 --> 36:49.139
Running out of time, Mel.
$50,000, final offer.

36:49.207 --> 36:50.799
What's happening here?

36:50.875 --> 36:54.038
Money is not what this is all
about. I want a "yes" or "no."

36:54.111 --> 36:55.874
Then it's "no."

36:58.349 --> 37:01.614
You can do a lot for your kid
with $50,000, Mel.

37:03.621 --> 37:06.112
Or you can take out a loan
for his funeral.

37:12.330 --> 37:14.321
Let me get this straight...

37:14.765 --> 37:18.496
are you threatening my child?
I don't believe this.

37:18.736 --> 37:20.294
Believe it, Mel.

37:52.470 --> 37:55.234
Well, just the man
I've been looking for.

37:55.306 --> 37:57.706
You took the words
right out of my mouth.

37:57.842 --> 38:00.470
And that's not all
I'm going to say.

38:30.841 --> 38:31.933
Slow.

38:33.744 --> 38:37.202
Blowing me up in your garage won't
fall into your pattern of accidents.

38:37.281 --> 38:40.978
Going to prison doesn't fall into
my pattern of living. To your left.

38:41.118 --> 38:43.609
Slow. Now, open that door.

38:44.455 --> 38:45.649
Take it easy.

38:50.361 --> 38:51.419
Easy.

38:53.164 --> 38:56.361
It takes four minutes to heat,
dry, and seal the paint on a car.

38:56.434 --> 38:59.961
Temperature in here should
cook you in about 30 seconds.

39:08.779 --> 39:11.304
KITT.
I hear you, Michael.

39:11.415 --> 39:12.712
I got problems.

39:12.883 --> 39:17.149
Your comlink signal indicates you are
locked in a hermetically sealed chamber.

39:17.254 --> 39:19.415
You have enough air
for over two hours.

39:19.490 --> 39:22.948
Yeah, maybe, you're right, but I can
be burned to a crisp in 30 seconds.

39:23.027 --> 39:24.824
Get in here.
I'm on my way.

39:47.017 --> 39:50.612
No! Stop it. Stop it. No.

40:10.474 --> 40:12.203
KITT, the generator, jam it.

40:13.377 --> 40:16.778
Stand back from the door, Michael.
It may blow while I micro jam.

40:17.948 --> 40:19.142
Oh, dear.

40:19.216 --> 40:21.514
Come on, buddy,
its getting hot in here.

40:21.585 --> 40:22.984
Jamming.

40:30.661 --> 40:32.151
Michael, are you all right?

40:32.229 --> 40:34.561
I'm still cooking in here.
Can't you get this door open?

40:34.632 --> 40:36.361
No, I can't. I'm immobile.

40:36.500 --> 40:39.025
Melanie, the heat chamber.
Open that door.

40:39.904 --> 40:43.271
Not now. Open the door, then
you have my permission to faint.

40:52.750 --> 40:54.843
I'm glad you were around.

40:55.052 --> 40:56.747
I'm afraid I wasn't
for a while.

40:56.821 --> 40:58.880
Yeah. You were here
when it counted.

40:58.956 --> 41:00.184
I'll be back.

41:00.791 --> 41:04.022
Are you injured, Michael?
No, I'm just a little tanned.

41:04.595 --> 41:06.290
You seemed to be
up in the air over this.

41:06.363 --> 41:09.491
It's no joking matter. I
find this posture humiliating.

41:10.334 --> 41:11.801
Thank you, Michael.

41:14.705 --> 41:17.265
All right, let her rip.

41:35.292 --> 41:38.420
All right, scan the area,
see if you can pick up Hanson.

41:41.866 --> 41:44.164
There he is, Michael.
West on Route 4.

41:45.035 --> 41:48.664
The test track.
All right, let's get him.

41:49.373 --> 41:51.864
I got a little going-away
present for him.

41:52.142 --> 41:54.406
I want to deliver it to him
in person.

42:04.088 --> 42:05.783
You cut it pretty close.

42:05.856 --> 42:08.017
I was two minutes away from
heading for the penthouse.

42:08.092 --> 42:10.026
So be glad you didn't.

42:10.294 --> 42:13.457
I brought along a little extra
pocket-money for our trip.

42:16.901 --> 42:19.665
Unless that's your travel agent,
you've got some trouble coming.

42:19.737 --> 42:21.068
He's supposed to be dead.

42:21.138 --> 42:23.766
This time there won't be
any margin for error.

42:33.284 --> 42:36.310
Michael, I'm sure you're aware
of the armament in that vehicle.

42:36.387 --> 42:39.686
I am very aware. You watch for
missiles, I'll cover the rest.

43:21.599 --> 43:23.692
Michael, we're driving
right into his line of fire.

43:23.767 --> 43:25.029
Hang in there.

43:51.996 --> 43:55.227
He seems to be running, Michael.
Don't be too sure of that.

44:04.842 --> 44:07.402
Michael, those are
armor-piercing grenades.

44:19.289 --> 44:21.985
I don't like surprises,
Michael. Me, either.

44:23.327 --> 44:24.419
What's he got left?

44:24.495 --> 44:27.464
Fifty-caliber machine guns and
over six tons of armor plate.

44:27.531 --> 44:30.227
I'm sure you have a plan.
I always have a plan.

45:10.808 --> 45:12.639
He's disarmed, nothing left.

45:17.147 --> 45:18.375
Come on out.

45:18.749 --> 45:21.115
Hey, have I got
a truck for you.

45:21.585 --> 45:25.521
It's big, and it's gray, got these
nice little bars on the windows.

45:25.589 --> 45:28.080
Oh, yeah, it's got some fancy
printing on the side that says:

45:28.158 --> 45:31.150
Department of Corrections.
You'll love the view.

45:40.537 --> 45:42.664
Keep an eye on him.
Yes, Michael.

45:50.748 --> 45:53.911
Oh, Michael, are you all
right? Yeah, I'm fine.

45:53.984 --> 45:56.612
In fact, I'll be going
home tonight. He won't.

45:58.922 --> 46:01.015
Well, I guess that ties
everything up, doesn't it?

46:01.091 --> 46:02.251
Not quite.

46:03.393 --> 46:05.088
You know, I never did...

46:05.162 --> 46:08.393
tell you how attractive you
are without that welding mask.

46:09.066 --> 46:10.124
Don't make me blush.

46:10.200 --> 46:13.135
I may not look it, but I am
the president of a company now.

46:13.203 --> 46:15.103
Not until
the board of directors meet.

46:15.172 --> 46:18.335
In that case, I have a few
minutes. Well, in that case...

46:46.203 --> 46:47.261
Thank you.

46:54.645 --> 46:58.376
International Airport. I have
to be there in 30 minutes.

46:59.483 --> 47:00.950
Not likely, ma'am.

47:01.785 --> 47:03.616
Will you settle
for Police Headquarters...

47:03.687 --> 47:06.918
and maybe a little drive through
the park on the way there?

47:09.359 --> 47:12.226
I have $250,000 here.

47:13.030 --> 47:16.056
I'm willing to pay half
for the airport trip.

47:16.366 --> 47:17.390
Did you hear that, KITT?

47:17.467 --> 47:19.731
Well, Michael, now we know
what you're worth.

47:19.803 --> 47:21.668
Does she want to make me
an offer?

47:27.344 --> 47:30.370
Well, I do have another
$25,000 for your friend.

47:31.148 --> 47:33.708
$25,000. What do you say,
buddy?

47:33.817 --> 47:36.411
I find that offer
unacceptable.

47:36.486 --> 47:38.784
I'd rather
the drive through the park.

47:39.489 --> 47:41.252
You've offended him.

47:41.692 --> 47:43.421
I guess you go directly
to jail.

47:51.001 --> 47:52.969
Michael?
Yes?

47:53.604 --> 47:55.196
That offer she made...

47:55.739 --> 47:58.105
do you think she knows
I'm air-conditioned?
