WEBVTT

00:21.063 --> 00:24.608
Well, I'm still just wide-awake.
Must be the pressure.

00:24.608 --> 00:25.901
I mean, what if I can't relax?

00:25.901 --> 00:28.445
When I want to relax, I shut my eyes
and imagine I'm in a nice, hot bath.

00:28.445 --> 00:31.573
I hate baths. You just lie there
in your own filth. Like a hippo.

00:31.573 --> 00:34.868
That's why every time I have a bath,
I always have a shower afterwards.

00:34.868 --> 00:35.994
That's ridiculous.

00:35.994 --> 00:37.704
That's just doubling
the time it takes to wash.

00:37.704 --> 00:38.789
Why not just have a shower?

00:38.789 --> 00:41.834
Well, 'cause I like having a bath
and sitting in my filth like a hippo.

00:43.418 --> 00:46.004
No wonder there's no hot water
for me left in the morning.

00:57.391 --> 00:58.392
Well done for doing this.

00:58.392 --> 00:59.685
No, I wanna do it.

01:00.185 --> 01:02.563
- Well, I guess I'll see you tomorrow.
- Yep.

01:03.230 --> 01:05.065
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

01:05.065 --> 01:06.400
Okay.

01:06.400 --> 01:07.484
I'll miss you.

01:07.484 --> 01:09.278
Course you will. 'Cause I'm amazing.

01:09.278 --> 01:11.488
Also, you are paying
for the next water bill.

01:11.488 --> 01:12.573
Fair enough.

01:14.283 --> 01:16.201
- Night night, Veg.
- Have a good one.

01:21.081 --> 01:22.165
- Yep, sorry.
- Come on, mate.

01:22.165 --> 01:23.458
I haven't got all day.

01:26.170 --> 01:27.546
Thanks.

01:30.174 --> 01:31.466
- Hiya.
- Hi.

01:31.466 --> 01:32.801
- Lisa Osgood.
- Okay.

01:33.969 --> 01:35.512
Can you fill this out, please?

01:35.512 --> 01:36.597
Thank you.

01:39.016 --> 01:40.851
- Your room's through here.
- Thank you.

01:41.518 --> 01:43.187
Can I get you something to drink?

01:43.937 --> 01:45.314
I could murder a dry white wine.

01:47.149 --> 01:50.027
- I don't think--
- No, I'm joking. Sorry, I'm fine. Thanks.

01:52.613 --> 01:53.906
Thank you.

01:56.200 --> 01:58.535
Okay, yeah, this is pretty--

02:20.724 --> 02:24.645
Okay, question. When you have a bath,
do you have a shower afterwards?

02:24.645 --> 02:26.980
<i>No. That would double your washing time.
That's mental.</i>

02:26.980 --> 02:29.566
Thank you. That is what I said.
Sorry, I just wanted a second opinion.

02:29.566 --> 02:31.068
Let's see your room. What's it like?

02:33.028 --> 02:34.404
Can you imagine Buzz Lightyear's coffin?

02:34.404 --> 02:35.822
<i>What are you talking about? No.</i>

02:35.822 --> 02:37.324
<i>That was a bit random, wasn't it?</i>

02:37.324 --> 02:39.368
Honestly, though, you should think
about doing one of these.

02:39.368 --> 02:40.953
What? You don't even know if it works yet.

02:42.162 --> 02:44.748
- Wow. That's a good look for you.
- <i>Thank you.</i>

02:44.748 --> 02:46.750
That's amazing. That's it right there.

02:49.586 --> 02:51.547
<i>I mean, at this point I'll try anything.</i>

02:51.547 --> 02:53.632
<i>Think Veggie's really starting
to worry about me.</i>

02:53.632 --> 02:56.218
<i>Yesterday he caught me
putting one of Poppy's toys on the cooker.</i>

02:56.218 --> 02:57.135
<i>You what?</i>

02:57.135 --> 02:58.637
<i>Admittedly, it was a toy kettle,</i>

02:58.637 --> 03:01.181
but I just c-- I can't go on
without sleep, can I?

03:01.181 --> 03:03.433
What do you hope to get out of it?
Do you think they're gonna cure you?

03:03.433 --> 03:04.434
<i>God, I hope so.</i>

03:04.434 --> 03:07.479
And with any luck,
they'll be able to do something

03:07.479 --> 03:09.314
about my restless leg syndrome.

03:09.314 --> 03:10.941
- Your restless what?
- It's just really weird.

03:10.941 --> 03:13.318
Anytime I try and sleep,
it's like my legs wanna get up.

03:13.318 --> 03:14.862
You and your legs share the same brain?

03:14.862 --> 03:16.989
Yeah, you know, I'm not so sure
that's true anymore, Danny.

03:16.989 --> 03:18.574
<i>It's the truth.</i>

03:19.992 --> 03:20.993
What was that?

03:20.993 --> 03:23.120
That would be Daisy.

03:24.288 --> 03:25.289
Who's Daisy?

03:26.540 --> 03:28.041
<i>That's Daisy.</i>

03:28.709 --> 03:29.877
Where did that come from?

03:29.877 --> 03:32.796
<i>Right, well, earlier,
I got a knock on the door from Adam.</i>

03:34.965 --> 03:36.091
All right, dude?

03:37.968 --> 03:40.554
Don't suppose you could do me a big favor
and look after Daisy?

03:42.890 --> 03:44.600
- Who's Daisy?
- What?

03:45.475 --> 03:47.436
Daisy, meet Danny.

03:47.436 --> 03:50.105
I'm looking after her
while Mrs. Jackson's in hospital.

03:50.105 --> 03:53.066
Her angina's flared up again.
But I've just been called in.

03:53.066 --> 03:54.359
Fire at the chemical plant.

03:54.860 --> 03:56.528
Now, Daisy is very low-maintenance.

03:56.528 --> 04:00.532
Although, she is working through
a few issues. You know, emotionally.

04:03.118 --> 04:04.077
What kind of issues?

04:04.077 --> 04:06.580
Well, her therapist says
that it is clinical depression.

04:07.247 --> 04:10.709
- Brought on by her inferiority complex.
- Sorry, did you say it's got a therapist?

04:10.709 --> 04:13.795
Daisy doesn't like loud noises,
bright lights or big surprises.

04:13.795 --> 04:17.132
And she really doesn't like
being criticized. Makes her spiral.

04:18.382 --> 04:19.885
I just thought, you know,
with all your problems,

04:19.885 --> 04:21.428
you'd both get on like a house on fire.

04:21.970 --> 04:27.059
And if she does get really stressed,
then Mr. Poppet will calm her down.

04:27.059 --> 04:30.145
<i>And being the great neighbor that I am,
I said...</i>

04:30.145 --> 04:33.148
No. It's a no. Thank you.

04:40.030 --> 04:41.073
It's a yes. Come on.

04:47.037 --> 04:48.580
- <i>It's a little dog.</i>
- Little?

04:48.580 --> 04:52.209
<i>I could put a saddle on it and ride it
into town. Look at it. It's got biceps.</i>

04:52.209 --> 04:56.046
Worst thing is, it doesn't like being left
alone. Tried to use the toilet, right?

04:56.046 --> 04:59.341
And it bust the door open to get in.
I thought it was the SAS.

04:59.341 --> 05:01.677
<i>Well, maybe it was just desperate
to use the loo.</i>

05:02.469 --> 05:03.720
See, it won't leave me alone.

05:03.720 --> 05:06.807
- What do you want from me?
- <i>She likes you, Danny.</i>

05:06.807 --> 05:08.100
You should be happy about it.

05:08.100 --> 05:10.102
A female who's into you.
It doesn't happen that often.

05:10.102 --> 05:11.770
- That's harsh.
- Sorry.

05:11.770 --> 05:14.231
On that subject, actually.
I'm thinking of contacting Amy.

05:14.231 --> 05:16.525
In your honest opinion, how long
do you have to wait to text a girl

05:16.525 --> 05:21.113
- if you recently cut off their finger?
- I mean, I'd say 500 years.

05:21.113 --> 05:22.197
Really?

05:23.365 --> 05:24.658
That's such a shame.

05:24.658 --> 05:26.994
- She was great. I really liked her.
- Yeah.

05:26.994 --> 05:27.953
<i>She was really funny.</i>

05:27.953 --> 05:29.788
<i>Really funny, yeah. Really, really funny.</i>

05:29.788 --> 05:31.123
- <i>I remember that.</i>
- She was so funny.

05:31.123 --> 05:33.750
Look, I actually can't keep talking
right now,

05:33.750 --> 05:35.169
'cause I have to try and sleep, okay?

05:36.461 --> 05:38.005
Yeah, same. I should probably get going.

05:38.005 --> 05:39.631
<i>Oh, yeah? What are you up to?</i>

05:39.631 --> 05:42.384
I got a job interview to prepare for.

05:43.010 --> 05:44.553
- <i>With who?</i>
- The <i>Rolling Stone</i> magazine.

05:44.553 --> 05:47.681
No. Stop it. Oh, my God.
Danny, that's amazing.

05:47.681 --> 05:48.765
Why didn't you say anything?

05:48.765 --> 05:50.100
Well, 'cause I didn't wanna jinx it.

05:50.100 --> 05:52.227
It's just an interview,
so I don't wanna get ahead of myself.

05:52.227 --> 05:55.647
Only an interview? No, it's brilliant.
Trust me. You are so gonna get that.

05:55.647 --> 05:57.482
No. You've done it. No, you've said it.

05:57.482 --> 05:58.942
- <i>You've jinxed me.</i>
- Wha-- No.

05:59.526 --> 06:00.402
<i>Well done.</i>

06:02.279 --> 06:03.238
Where have you gone?

06:03.238 --> 06:06.241
Lisa. I'm Dr. Stafford. You've met Kat.

06:06.241 --> 06:07.451
Hello.

06:07.951 --> 06:10.954
So, I'm just going to explain a little bit
about what happens here.

06:11.538 --> 06:14.833
- We're going to monitor you with these--
- Polysomnographic magnets?

06:14.833 --> 06:16.710
You've done some research, I see.

06:16.710 --> 06:20.464
These assist us in assessing
and studying your sleep patterns,

06:20.464 --> 06:22.674
and your cognitive behavior.
We use the results to--

06:22.674 --> 06:25.677
Help formulate a strategy
to treat my sleep disorder

06:25.677 --> 06:27.054
and my night routine.

06:28.305 --> 06:30.307
Looks like we have an expert here, Kat.

06:30.307 --> 06:32.351
That won't get irritating at all.

06:32.351 --> 06:35.812
I just need you to press "agree."

06:37.189 --> 06:39.691
Sorry. I've lost the page.

06:39.691 --> 06:41.485
- Sorry.
- Don't worry.

06:42.069 --> 06:46.448
Let me just try and f--

06:48.992 --> 06:50.410
I like your shoes.

06:50.410 --> 06:54.790
Thank you. Kat here thinks
they're a bit too in-your-face.

06:55.749 --> 06:58.210
I didn't mean it to come out like that.

07:00.337 --> 07:02.506
Right. Whilst we're waiting for Kat.

07:02.506 --> 07:06.176
Do you have with you any stimulants,
like caffeinated drinks,

07:06.176 --> 07:09.721
or gadgets and devices?
A laptop, tablet or phone?

07:10.722 --> 07:11.557
- Good.
- No.

07:11.557 --> 07:14.393
Now, have you been to the toilet?

07:14.393 --> 07:17.646
Yeah, I did go but nothing came out.

07:17.646 --> 07:19.565
Will that affect my diagnosis?

07:19.565 --> 07:22.901
That's not a problem.
If you need to go in the night, you can.

07:22.901 --> 07:26.738
Just remember to switch off your mic.
It's that little button there.

07:27.531 --> 07:31.076
- Found it.
- Alert the press. Inform the king.

07:31.660 --> 07:32.828
Just press there.

07:32.828 --> 07:35.581
So, it's half past 11:00.
The lights will be going out shortly.

07:35.581 --> 07:36.999
Please attempt to sleep.

07:36.999 --> 07:39.543
- Good night.
- Night night.

07:41.003 --> 07:43.881
- I do really like your shoes.
- Too little too late, Kat.

08:01.607 --> 08:04.776
Why do you have to make my life so hard?
It's just a cat. Oi.

08:06.987 --> 08:08.697
Come up here. Come up here. Up again.

08:11.950 --> 08:13.327
Stay. Watch.

08:14.536 --> 08:16.830
Let me just-- And then I can--

08:30.427 --> 08:35.349
Oi. Listen to me.
Stay. Stay there. I'm getting Mr. Poppet.

08:39.727 --> 08:43.941
Daisy, what's this? Look what I--

08:47.569 --> 08:48.570
What the--

08:48.570 --> 08:51.949
No, no. No, what have you done?

08:52.908 --> 08:58.497
Oh, my God. What have you done?
You f-- You giant-- hairy anus.

09:02.167 --> 09:05.921
Daisy, come back. I'm sorry.
I take it back. I take "anus" back.

09:18.642 --> 09:19.476
<i>Hello?</i>

09:19.476 --> 09:20.811
She's destroyed it all.

09:21.562 --> 09:22.396
What?

09:22.396 --> 09:24.898
<i>All my interview prep. And the interview
is in four hours. LA time.</i>

09:25.482 --> 09:27.401
- Oh, my God. That's awful.
- <i>Oh, yeah.</i>

09:27.401 --> 09:30.946
Big time. All of it's gone.
Prep, gone. Ideas, gone.

09:30.946 --> 09:34.199
All of it's gone.
I had full pages on <i>Bowie and Prince</i>,

09:34.199 --> 09:36.785
<i>The Hologram Superband</i>.
I had <i>Cremated To Creedence,</i>

09:36.785 --> 09:39.538
<i>The Ultimate Send-Off</i>. It's all gone.
She's deleted it all.

09:39.538 --> 09:42.165
<i>And she's deleted it in a way
that makes it somehow irretrievable.</i>

09:42.165 --> 09:43.292
How's that possible?

09:44.001 --> 09:45.669
Do you think she's some kind
of evil genius?

09:45.669 --> 09:48.630
- Wait, are we talking about the dog here?
- Yeah, and she's playing silly billies.

09:48.630 --> 09:50.257
She turned my laptop's language
into Spanish.

09:50.257 --> 09:51.175
- <i>What?</i>
- Yeah.

09:51.175 --> 09:52.843
I looked up "troubleshooting"
in Spanish, which was fine,

09:52.843 --> 09:54.469
but now I'm having
to use the troubleshooting page

09:54.469 --> 09:56.722
for troubleshooting in the wrong language.
It's all a bit too much.

09:57.472 --> 09:58.640
<i>It's getting the better of me.</i>

09:58.640 --> 10:01.643
I'm sorry.
I know you're supposed to be sleeping,

10:01.643 --> 10:03.312
but you're the only person I can call.

10:03.312 --> 10:05.063
No, it's fine. Everything's fine.

10:05.063 --> 10:08.859
Look, just breathe, okay?
Just make sure-- Are you breathing?

10:13.280 --> 10:14.239
Unfortunately, yeah.

10:14.239 --> 10:15.741
<i>Okay, give me two seconds.</i>

10:18.952 --> 10:21.955
Hiya. Sorry, I really need the toilet.

10:22.497 --> 10:23.999
<i>Is that-- Can I go?</i>

10:27.002 --> 10:29.880
The door's not locked, Ms. Osgood.

10:29.880 --> 10:31.340
Good.

10:32.633 --> 10:34.301
How you doing? You okay?

10:34.301 --> 10:36.261
Oh, yeah. Never better.

10:36.261 --> 10:39.640
Good. I'm just trying to find the loo.

10:39.640 --> 10:40.724
Yeah.

10:47.147 --> 10:48.273
Caught me red-handed.

10:49.441 --> 10:52.236
Can I bribe you with a Twix
to forget you ever saw me?

10:52.903 --> 10:55.656
- No need. I won't tell if you don't.
- Clyde.

10:56.573 --> 10:58.033
- Lisa. Hi. Yeah.
- Yes.

10:58.033 --> 10:59.535
My fourth time in here.

11:01.328 --> 11:02.538
What are you in for?

11:03.038 --> 11:05.916
Insomnia and restless legs. You?

11:05.916 --> 11:11.922
Night terrors. And other stuff as well,
which I won't bore you with now.

11:11.922 --> 11:13.257
I'll just--

11:13.257 --> 11:15.592
If you can't sleep, I can download
some movies onto your phone.

11:15.592 --> 11:17.427
Thanks. I'll remember that.

11:17.928 --> 11:20.430
It's mainly sci-fi.
I've got <i>Men in Black 3</i>,

11:20.430 --> 11:22.933
<i>Independence Day</i>, <i>Star Trek Into Darkness,</i>

11:22.933 --> 11:24.935
<i>Total Recall</i>, <i>War of the Worlds.</i>

11:25.769 --> 11:27.688
<i>Prometheus</i>, <i>Men in Black 1,</i>

11:27.688 --> 11:30.691
<i>The Abyss</i>, <i>Alien, Alien: Resurrection,</i>

11:30.691 --> 11:34.653
and my own personal favorite,
<i>Terminator 2.</i>

11:34.653 --> 11:36.905
Yeah. I'm just gonna--

11:45.622 --> 11:46.456
Not again.

11:52.087 --> 11:54.673
Okay, I've only got ten minutes,
'cause I really need to sleep.

11:57.092 --> 11:58.760
<i>Okay, maybe I could stretch to 15.</i>

11:58.760 --> 12:01.555
Listen,
maybe this is a blessing in disguise.

12:01.555 --> 12:03.640
You can be spontaneous.
You can talk from the heart.

12:03.640 --> 12:06.476
<i>I can barely talk from the mouth.
I should just cancel it.</i>

12:06.476 --> 12:08.270
<i>Let's face it,
I can't talk to human beings.</i>

12:08.270 --> 12:09.646
You're fine talking to me.

12:09.646 --> 12:11.440
Yeah, but I don't class you
as a human being.

12:12.107 --> 12:14.193
- That was meant to be a compliment.
- I took it as one, thanks.

12:14.193 --> 12:16.778
Honestly,
these Zoomy-Skypey type meetings,

12:16.778 --> 12:19.698
they're hard enough as it is.
But now-- Nah.

12:19.698 --> 12:21.283
I can't freestyle my way
through that interview

12:21.283 --> 12:22.784
with all those faces looking at me.

12:22.784 --> 12:25.204
I feel like I'm being tried
for a crime in a dystopian future.

12:25.204 --> 12:27.456
See, I always thought you'd be good
at this kind of stuff.

12:28.373 --> 12:31.126
I don't know what it is.
Interviews, exams.

12:31.835 --> 12:35.297
Something just happens to my brain.
Like my first driving test.

12:35.297 --> 12:39.593
<i>There I was, town center,
having a minor nervous breakdown,</i>

12:39.593 --> 12:42.179
- <i>when the examiner said...</i>
- Take the next left-hand turn.

12:42.179 --> 12:45.682
<i>So I was panicking, thinking,
"Did he mean this left?</i>

12:45.682 --> 12:49.478
<i>He can't have meant this left.
But it is the next left.</i>

12:49.478 --> 12:52.397
<i>He said the next left. He's testing me,</i>

12:52.397 --> 12:54.816
<i>which would make sense
as this is the test.</i>

12:54.816 --> 12:56.860
<i>Yeah, he meant this left."</i>

13:01.782 --> 13:04.493
Why are we entering a car park?

13:05.285 --> 13:07.996
Yeah, sorry. I just--
When you said next left,

13:07.996 --> 13:10.874
I thought maybe-- Just two seconds.

13:14.586 --> 13:15.587
No.

13:18.590 --> 13:20.050
Bear with.

13:27.933 --> 13:32.104
<i>I had to drive up three levels
just so I could go down again to exit.</i>

13:34.106 --> 13:35.899
<i>Then, of course, I had to pay to get out.</i>

13:38.360 --> 13:39.361
Have you got 3.50?

13:40.279 --> 13:43.740
<i>Honestly, don't worry
about the prep, okay? Just be likable.</i>

13:43.740 --> 13:45.576
When it comes to interviews,
it's all about attitude

13:45.576 --> 13:47.327
and projecting confidence, okay?

13:47.327 --> 13:49.288
You can't let your nerves
get the better of you.

13:49.288 --> 13:51.623
- <i>Do you wanna know what I always picture?</i>
- The interviewer naked.

13:51.623 --> 13:53.709
What? No. The egg in the shoe.

13:53.709 --> 13:55.627
- What?
- <i>My gran taught it to me.</i>

13:55.627 --> 13:56.920
<i>Said if I was ever feeling nervous,</i>

13:56.920 --> 13:59.923
<i>I should just picture whoever
is talking to me has an egg in their shoe.</i>

14:01.884 --> 14:02.718
Why an egg?

14:02.718 --> 14:03.635
Well, exactly.

14:03.635 --> 14:05.721
Why would they have an egg in their shoe?

14:06.221 --> 14:07.764
All right,
doesn't like the egg in the shoe.

14:07.764 --> 14:09.141
What are you looking for?

14:09.725 --> 14:12.144
Daisy. She's hiding.
I think I've upset her.

14:12.144 --> 14:13.604
<i>Well, at least it's calmed you down.</i>

14:13.604 --> 14:14.980
<i>But what about your interview?</i>

14:14.980 --> 14:18.150
<i>Balls. No, no.
I can't focus with Daisy in panic mode.</i>

14:26.658 --> 14:27.659
You all right there?

14:29.119 --> 14:32.039
Listen to me.
I'm sorry I called you useless.

14:32.039 --> 14:34.958
But we both said stuff in the heat
of the moment that we now regret.

14:35.542 --> 14:39.213
So, how about we forget about the past?
Start afresh, clean slate.

14:39.213 --> 14:42.090
And you come out from under the bed.
What do you have to say about that?

14:43.634 --> 14:44.635
Fair enough.

14:46.803 --> 14:48.764
It's not working.
What can I do to cheer her up?

14:48.764 --> 14:50.182
<i>What do animals like? Food.</i>

14:50.182 --> 14:51.975
<i>They like food, don't they?
I can make an omelet.</i>

14:51.975 --> 14:52.935
An omelet would be nice.

14:55.229 --> 14:56.230
You up for a little omelet?

14:56.230 --> 14:58.524
<i>Why is the dog under the bed a bad thing?</i>

14:59.107 --> 15:01.109
<i>Like, now you can concentrate
on your interview.</i>

15:01.109 --> 15:02.986
I just don't want her thinking
I'm a bad person.

15:02.986 --> 15:04.446
I hate the thought
of someone being mad at me.

15:04.446 --> 15:06.114
<i>That's why I can't do arguments.</i>

15:06.114 --> 15:08.033
<i>I always crack first.
Three years with Chloe</i>

15:08.033 --> 15:09.076
<i>and I never won a single one</i>.

15:09.076 --> 15:11.578
Like that time
she thought Mark Wahlberg was Vanilla Ice.

15:11.578 --> 15:12.955
Wasn't he Marky Mark?

15:12.955 --> 15:14.957
Yeah. Vanilla Ice
is a completely different person.

15:14.957 --> 15:16.375
She ended up talking me around.

15:16.375 --> 15:19.044
Yeah, it's not like Chloe
to be manipulative, is it?

15:20.587 --> 15:23.173
Nothing. Look, I really have to go.
Danny, look at me.

15:23.173 --> 15:25.092
- I'm looking.
- The interview is gonna be fine.

15:25.092 --> 15:27.261
You know everything there is to know
about music.

15:27.261 --> 15:28.804
You listen exclusively to bands

15:28.804 --> 15:30.639
that no one
in the real world's even heard of.

15:30.639 --> 15:32.641
Thanks so much for saying that.
I really appreciate it.

15:32.641 --> 15:35.853
Yeah. And also talking to LA all night.
The hours are perfect.

15:35.853 --> 15:37.813
But I wouldn't be working
through the night if I got the job.

15:37.813 --> 15:38.897
Okay. Well, that's great.

15:38.897 --> 15:40.357
Yeah. Job's in LA. I'd have to move there.

15:42.484 --> 15:46.196
- Daisy. Come on. Look at this.
- <i>So sorry, so sorry.</i>

15:46.196 --> 15:47.406
Can I check in?

15:47.406 --> 15:50.993
You know when you just said LA,
you meant, like in Los Angeles?

15:50.993 --> 15:53.871
That's right. Come on.

15:53.871 --> 15:57.082
Yes. Thank God.

16:04.548 --> 16:06.091
Are you okay in there?

16:06.091 --> 16:08.093
Fine, thank you.

16:08.093 --> 16:09.928
Why are you doing a lady's voice?
You're already a lady.

16:12.222 --> 16:14.141
Perhaps I should have made this clearer,

16:14.141 --> 16:18.103
but it's quite difficult
to monitor you in the toilet.

16:31.366 --> 16:35.370
- <i>Hey.</i>
- Hey. How's Daisy?

16:35.370 --> 16:37.706
She's great. She bloody loved the omelet.

16:37.706 --> 16:41.043
Cool. Look, so... LA.

16:41.043 --> 16:42.294
Yeah?

16:42.294 --> 16:44.379
Do you really think
you can move out there?

16:46.006 --> 16:47.007
I haven't got the gig yet.

16:47.007 --> 16:49.593
I know you haven't got the gig yet,
but if you did,

16:49.593 --> 16:51.553
<i>I mean,
we wouldn't be able to do this anymore.</i>

16:52.638 --> 16:56.350
- What do you mean? Of course we would.
- How? Your night would be my day.

17:00.187 --> 17:03.690
Yeah. But, I mean,
if this sleep clinic cures you, I mean--

17:04.441 --> 17:06.151
You know,
we wouldn't be able to do it anyway.

17:07.653 --> 17:10.155
Well, I can't really imagine
not doing this with you.

17:13.992 --> 17:16.537
I mean, I'm--
I just don't really see you in LA.

17:16.537 --> 17:19.164
- Like, I just-- Like in my head.
- Why?

17:19.164 --> 17:20.790
I just think you'd look weird.

17:20.790 --> 17:22.125
<i>But honestly,</i>

17:22.125 --> 17:25.045
how do you think you would actually,
like, you know, survive out there?

17:27.756 --> 17:28.757
I don't know.

17:29.967 --> 17:31.218
Probably the same I do here.

17:32.845 --> 17:34.888
Actually, I'm looking into flying
over the block of flats

17:34.888 --> 17:36.056
so I don't have to go outside.

17:36.056 --> 17:38.058
- What, like in <i>Up</i>?
- Exactly like in <i>Up</i>.

17:38.058 --> 17:40.394
That'd be great. Well,
at least you'd have Adam for company.

17:40.394 --> 17:42.563
Although he probably wouldn't notice
for a couple of weeks.

17:43.146 --> 17:46.024
<i>See, you'll miss this.
What are you even gonna do in LA?</i>

17:46.024 --> 17:47.067
You don't know anyone.

17:47.734 --> 17:51.780
Yeah. Actually, I think,
Chloe might be out there, but--

17:52.614 --> 17:54.616
- Really?
- Last I heard, yeah.

17:54.616 --> 17:59.204
Oh, well. If you see her,
I guess, tell her to piss off for me.

17:59.204 --> 18:00.455
Oh, come on. She's not that bad.

18:00.455 --> 18:03.000
What do you mean she wasn't that bad?
Danny, she was an absolute knob.

18:03.000 --> 18:05.627
- Especially what she did to you.
- Well, we're both to blame.

18:05.627 --> 18:07.254
I am trying to be the better person,
thank you.

18:07.254 --> 18:08.380
<i>You are so incredible,</i>

18:08.380 --> 18:11.091
you are incapable
of saying a bad word about her.

18:11.091 --> 18:13.802
I mean, honestly, if someone had cheated
behind my back with three people,

18:13.802 --> 18:16.555
<i>I would so not be defending them
the way that you are.</i>

18:18.223 --> 18:21.059
Sorry, what'd you say?
Did you say three people?

18:21.059 --> 18:21.977
<i>There was one person</i>.

18:21.977 --> 18:23.312
- Isn't it the Milo guy?
- <i>Was it?</i>

18:23.312 --> 18:25.147
Oh, yeah. Yeah, sorry.
I must have been mistaken.

18:25.147 --> 18:27.107
- You're saying it's three people?
- I'm not. Forget that.

18:27.107 --> 18:29.234
- How did you know it's three people?
- I don't know--

18:29.234 --> 18:31.069
- Lisa, how'd you know it's three people?
- I don't--

18:34.448 --> 18:36.783
I just heard about the other ones
from a friend of a friend.

18:36.783 --> 18:38.076
- A friend of a friend?
- <i>Yeah--</i>

18:38.076 --> 18:40.078
<i>It was just a stupid WhatsApp group
and then--</i>

18:40.078 --> 18:42.289
- There's a WhatsApp group?
- <i>No, not about this.</i>

18:42.289 --> 18:44.082
- Who's on the WhatsApp group?
- <i>I don't know.</i>

18:44.082 --> 18:45.876
<i>As soon as it got mentioned,
I left the group.</i>

18:45.876 --> 18:48.170
- <i>It's not-- It wasn't about this.</i>
- Okay.

18:49.213 --> 18:50.214
How long have you known?

18:50.214 --> 18:51.715
- What? Known? Like--
- That's a while.

18:51.715 --> 18:53.425
- <i>No, it's not a while. No.</i>
- It's a while. Okay.

18:53.425 --> 18:54.885
- Who else knows?
- I don't know.

18:54.885 --> 18:56.470
That's everyone. Okay. Everyone knows.

18:56.470 --> 18:58.305
Everyone knows
and nobody wanted to tell me?

18:58.305 --> 19:00.557
- No, Danny. Danny.
- It's fine. I'm actually--

19:01.350 --> 19:03.060
- <i>Danny, listen.</i>
- Can I call you back later?

19:03.060 --> 19:04.394
Hang on. This--

19:07.940 --> 19:09.066
Hand it over.

19:16.657 --> 19:17.991
Take it to the office.

19:37.386 --> 19:38.387
Idiot.

20:48.081 --> 20:49.082
Yes.

21:09.144 --> 21:10.145
No.

21:12.689 --> 21:16.860
Please don't tell her I'm here.
It's my break but she won't let me sleep.

21:16.860 --> 21:18.070
It's okay.

21:41.885 --> 21:42.886
Clyde.

21:45.138 --> 21:46.348
Clyde?

21:47.099 --> 21:48.225
Come with me if you want to live.

21:49.142 --> 21:51.103
Can I make a quick call first?

21:51.103 --> 21:53.522
No, you're sleepwalking. Clyde. Stop it!

21:54.940 --> 21:56.692
Clyde, you're sleepwalking. Stop it.

22:05.909 --> 22:07.160
Hello again.

22:07.160 --> 22:09.621
It's me. It's quite a commotion, isn't it?

22:09.621 --> 22:10.831
What's happened?

22:15.085 --> 22:16.211
What have you done?

22:21.049 --> 22:22.426
<i>Hi, this is Danny Gibson.</i>

22:22.426 --> 22:24.011
- <i>Leave me a message...</i>
- Night night.

22:24.011 --> 22:25.804
<i>...and I will try
and get back to you. Thanks</i>

22:27.139 --> 22:28.432
<i>Hiya. It's me.</i>

22:30.100 --> 22:33.478
<i>Funny story.
So, you know the sleep clinic I was at?</i>

22:33.478 --> 22:37.107
<i>Well, I have just been escorted
off the property</i>

22:37.107 --> 22:39.359
<i>and they have given me a lifetime ban.</i>

22:40.527 --> 22:42.404
I asked them if they could still
give me a diagnosis

22:42.404 --> 22:46.700
and the doctor said yes.
And then she told me I was a twat.

22:47.409 --> 22:50.621
So, I think that might be a first
for the medical world.

22:51.205 --> 22:52.664
<i>So you're stuck with me.</i>

22:53.540 --> 22:55.542
<i>You know, if you'll still have me.</i>

22:56.502 --> 22:59.087
<i>I'm so sorry
I didn't tell you about... you know.</i>

22:59.588 --> 23:01.924
<i>I knew it would upset you
and I was just too much of a coward</i>

23:01.924 --> 23:03.008
<i>to say anything.</i>

23:03.592 --> 23:07.095
<i>Actually, I made a new friend.
He's called Clyde. So, yeah.</i>

23:07.095 --> 23:10.641
<i>You know, if you stay made at me forever
then I'll probably just do this with him.</i>

23:11.266 --> 23:13.018
<i>Please don't stay mad at me.</i>

23:13.018 --> 23:15.354
<i>Look, I really wanna know
how your interview went, which is--</i>

23:15.854 --> 23:19.399
<i>It's happening right now.
I bet you're killing it. You're brilliant.</i>

23:20.234 --> 23:21.235
<i>Bye, Danny.</i>

23:26.907 --> 23:28.951
<i>Hi, Danny. Good to meet you.</i>

23:28.951 --> 23:30.869
<i>Hey, buddy. How you doing?</i>

23:30.869 --> 23:32.704
<i>Danny?</i>

23:36.542 --> 23:38.001
<i>That's not him.</i>

23:38.001 --> 23:40.838
- <i>Danny?</i>
- <i>Danny,</i> Rolling Stone.

23:41.588 --> 23:42.923
- <i>No. No.</i>
- <i>No.</i>

23:42.923 --> 23:45.300
- <i>Right, that's a no then. Bye.</i>
- <i>Sorry, Danny.</i>
