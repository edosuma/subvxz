00:43.978 --> 00:46.145
Ready or not, here I come!

00:46.180 --> 00:47.646
I thought we said the kitchen

00:47.681 --> 00:48.881
was supposed to be off limits.

00:48.916 --> 00:50.716
It's going to be hard

00:50.751 --> 00:52.785
to find anyone in here...

00:52.820 --> 00:55.120
Unless...

00:55.156 --> 00:58.490
Unless I smell cookies.

00:58.526 --> 00:59.725
[laughing] I gotcha!

00:59.760 --> 01:01.593

01:04.632 --> 01:06.331
let's go again!

01:06.367 --> 01:09.234
Aw, what, and waste
all these warm cookies?

01:09.270 --> 01:11.670
Mm... Yum yum yum.

01:11.705 --> 01:12.771
[laughing]

01:15.109 --> 01:16.408
[clara] I'm sad for other kids.

01:16.444 --> 01:18.911
You are? Why?

01:18.946 --> 01:23.916
They don't have a grandpa
with a christmas all-year store.

01:23.951 --> 01:25.084
Well, you know what I say.

01:25.119 --> 01:28.020
"why only celebrate one day..."

01:28.055 --> 01:30.456
when you can
celebrate every day!

01:32.960 --> 01:34.760
Did you start with ornaments,

01:34.795 --> 01:35.627
or decorations...

01:35.663 --> 01:38.297
Or the fudge?

01:38.332 --> 01:40.766
I started with candy canes.

01:40.801 --> 01:43.102
My favorite. Mm-hmm.

01:43.137 --> 01:47.973
So when I have
a question or a problem,

01:48.008 --> 01:51.276
I think on it while I eat one.

01:51.312 --> 01:52.778
Because they're so sweet?

01:52.813 --> 01:55.180
Because they last a long time,

01:55.216 --> 01:57.950
so I can think my question
all the way through,

01:57.985 --> 02:01.186
and when I get down
to the curly end,

02:01.222 --> 02:02.588
I have my answer.

02:04.525 --> 02:05.591
Grandpa, look!

02:09.196 --> 02:11.396
Maybe it's santa!

02:11.432 --> 02:13.198
Oh, it's a few weeks
early for santa.

02:13.234 --> 02:15.834
That's a shooting star.

02:15.870 --> 02:19.338
You should make a wish.

02:19.373 --> 02:21.473
How do you know
what to wish for?

02:21.509 --> 02:22.641
Mm...

02:22.676 --> 02:25.010
A wish is when

02:25.045 --> 02:27.079
you say out loud
what's in your heart.

02:27.114 --> 02:31.016
So, clara...

02:31.051 --> 02:33.685
What's in your heart?

02:33.721 --> 02:37.823
I wish to spend
every christmas forever

02:37.858 --> 02:38.857
with grandpa.

02:38.893 --> 02:39.691

02:48.569 --> 02:51.837
It's late, honey.

02:51.872 --> 02:53.172
Just five more minutes.

02:53.207 --> 02:56.008
That would be good.

04:08.349 --> 04:10.449

cancel christmas this year?

04:10.484 --> 04:11.583
You don't mean that.

04:11.619 --> 04:13.085
Uh, don't I?

04:13.120 --> 04:15.153

04:48.489 --> 04:49.688
Uh, I would like
to take you out to dinner.

04:49.723 --> 04:52.958
Fridays are
usually catch-up night.

04:52.993 --> 04:54.693
"gotta get my paperwork in."

04:54.728 --> 04:56.695
I know, but you're gonna
be gone for two weeks,

04:56.730 --> 04:58.830
and I'll miss you,

04:58.866 --> 05:02.000
so I made us a reservation
at rovanoff's.

05:02.036 --> 05:03.135
I will see you tonight.

05:03.170 --> 05:05.103

05:27.861 --> 05:28.860
Yeah.

05:28.896 --> 05:31.697
It'll be nice to spend
some time with my mother.

05:31.732 --> 05:34.166
Why? You thinking
about something?

05:34.201 --> 05:36.835
Actually...

05:36.870 --> 05:40.706
I've heard so much about
this candy cane confectionery...

05:40.741 --> 05:41.807
Hmm.

05:41.842 --> 05:44.343
...And I'd love to finally
be able to meet your mom,

-No?
-Don't think so.

06:17.678 --> 06:19.711
They're not renewing
my contract.

06:19.747 --> 06:20.512
What?

06:20.547 --> 06:23.582
They're cutting
the arts programs

06:23.617 --> 06:24.416
across the district,

06:24.451 --> 06:27.919
and because I don't have
seniority...

06:27.955 --> 06:30.789
They're saying that
I'm out of a job by June?

06:30.824 --> 06:31.823
That's impossible.

06:31.859 --> 06:34.226
You were voted one of
the teachers of the year.

06:34.261 --> 06:35.227
This year.

06:35.262 --> 06:36.962
I guess that doesn't matter.

06:38.799 --> 06:42.601
I've been at westend since
I was a student teacher.

07:30.751 --> 07:31.683
I should've bought
a couple for the shop.

Now, listen, about the house,
don't judge.

07:45.666 --> 07:47.132
-It's... It's fine.

07:47.167 --> 07:50.135
I had to bring paperwork home.

07:50.170 --> 07:51.703
Six months in, I hadn't realized

07:51.738 --> 07:53.171
how much grandpa and I
did together.

07:53.207 --> 07:54.840
Well, it's a two-person job,

Nope, today, you are going
to put your feet up.

Well, be with your mom,

12:18.772 --> 12:20.972
and that's...

12:23.610 --> 12:24.676
Merry christmas, clara.

12:24.711 --> 12:26.811
-Thank you.
-It was, um...

12:26.847 --> 12:28.913
It was great to see you.

12:35.989 --> 12:36.888
Hey, lo?

12:38.358 --> 12:39.424
Good to see you too.

12:56.977 --> 12:57.842
Somebody needed a few wreaths?

12:57.878 --> 13:00.512
You are my favorite child.

13:00.547 --> 13:01.546
I'm your only child.

13:01.581 --> 13:03.181
You're still my favorite.

13:03.216 --> 13:04.415
Mom, let me help.

13:04.451 --> 13:06.851
No, I just wanted to make sure
nobody slips on the way in.

13:06.887 --> 13:09.120
Leave the wreaths here, honey.
I'll put them up.

13:09.156 --> 13:09.988
Okay.

13:11.658 --> 13:14.325
[doorbells jingling]

13:16.897 --> 13:19.497
[♪♪♪]

13:45.358 --> 13:47.225
uh...

13:52.365 --> 13:54.999
[exhaling slowly]

13:56.970 --> 14:00.104
I can't believe
the twins are 10 already.

14:00.140 --> 14:01.840
Give them a hug for me?

14:01.875 --> 14:03.007
[clara] kelly! Bella!

14:03.577 --> 14:05.577
Mama! It's aunt clara!

14:05.612 --> 14:06.511
Aw!

14:06.546 --> 14:07.679
[squealing]

14:07.714 --> 14:09.380
hi!

14:11.585 --> 14:13.017
Look at you!

14:13.053 --> 14:14.953
I mean, you said it's happening,
but it's happening!

14:14.988 --> 14:17.055
I know, I know.
Four more weeks.

14:17.090 --> 14:17.922
I can't believe it.

14:17.958 --> 14:19.190
How's carl?

14:19.226 --> 14:20.024
Good.

14:20.060 --> 14:21.860
He's home for christmas,

14:21.895 --> 14:23.461
and we get him at fort bragg
for two years.

14:23.496 --> 14:24.429
Amazing.

14:24.464 --> 14:25.597
When are you coming over?

14:27.100 --> 14:28.533
Hot chocolate at my house
how soon?

14:28.568 --> 14:29.601
Very, very soon.

14:29.636 --> 14:30.501
Okay.

14:33.306 --> 14:35.640
I ran the register,
straightened up,

14:35.675 --> 14:37.542
brought back the empties,

14:37.577 --> 14:38.877
and I will drop the deposit
in the night slot

14:38.912 --> 14:39.777
on the way home.

14:39.813 --> 14:41.112
[sighing]

14:41.147 --> 14:42.380
the store looks great.

14:42.415 --> 14:43.381
The front part.

14:43.416 --> 14:44.215
[laughing]

14:44.251 --> 14:45.483
the wreaths
were a nice addition.

14:45.518 --> 14:46.417
Thanks for that.

14:46.453 --> 14:48.586
You'll never guess
who I bought it from.

14:48.622 --> 14:49.721
Logan.

14:49.756 --> 14:51.556
Logan-logan?

14:51.591 --> 14:52.891
High school logan?

14:52.926 --> 14:54.425
Mm-hmm.

14:55.929 --> 14:57.295
How was that?

14:57.330 --> 14:58.930
Fine. Weird.

14:59.966 --> 15:01.499
He made it to lt. Colonel.

15:01.534 --> 15:04.435
Well, good for him.

15:04.471 --> 15:05.770
So he's... He's on leave?

15:05.805 --> 15:09.107
Actually, he's back,

15:09.142 --> 15:11.409
in the reserves,
working with his dad.

15:11.444 --> 15:12.610
Huh. Yeah.

15:13.546 --> 15:15.146
And how's blake?

15:15.181 --> 15:15.947
Fine.

15:15.982 --> 15:17.815
Hey, come on, mom.
Take a break.

15:17.851 --> 15:19.317
Let me do that.

15:20.620 --> 15:22.921
Come on.

15:22.956 --> 15:27.592
Blake seems like
a steady, good guy.

15:27.627 --> 15:28.793
Dependable.

15:28.828 --> 15:29.928
Not like...

15:29.963 --> 15:30.828
Crazy logan?

15:30.864 --> 15:31.796
You have to admit,

15:31.831 --> 15:34.098
all those adventures
you and logan went on?

15:34.134 --> 15:35.099
We were teenagers,

15:35.135 --> 15:36.968
and I thought you liked
that spirit in him.

15:37.003 --> 15:39.037
You liked that spirit in him,

15:39.072 --> 15:40.505
so what could I say?

15:40.540 --> 15:42.774
I was a single mom,

15:42.809 --> 15:44.776
dying every time
he said "hop in the car,

15:44.811 --> 15:45.977
let me take you somewhere."

15:51.685 --> 15:54.485
clara?

15:54.521 --> 15:55.453
Something going on?

15:57.490 --> 16:00.224
How did you know
that dad was the one?

16:00.260 --> 16:03.795
Well, the second we met,
I just knew,

16:03.830 --> 16:04.796
but why are we...?

16:04.831 --> 16:07.532
And then when he proposed?

16:07.567 --> 16:11.169
I said yes before
he finished the sentence.

16:14.674 --> 16:16.140
You were so young, though.

16:16.176 --> 16:18.876
Even if someone had told me
he wouldn't make it home,

16:18.912 --> 16:21.079
I would have said yes
a million times over.

16:21.114 --> 16:23.514
When you know, you know.

16:25.552 --> 16:27.318
And what is going on?

16:27.354 --> 16:29.387
Nothing.

16:30.957 --> 16:32.523
Come on. Let's go
do the paperwork.

16:32.559 --> 16:33.391
Bring the fudge.

16:41.401 --> 16:43.735
The man
had some kind of system.

16:43.770 --> 16:45.837
I... Should have...

16:45.872 --> 16:47.238
Made him formalize it.

16:47.273 --> 16:49.474
Asked questions, or something.

16:51.211 --> 16:52.210
It was so sudden, mom.

16:52.245 --> 16:55.847
But I knew
this day would come.

16:55.882 --> 16:58.016
I depended on him
for so much.

16:58.051 --> 17:00.685
He was my rock
when your father died.

17:00.720 --> 17:02.720
-Me too.

17:02.756 --> 17:04.122
Oh...

17:04.157 --> 17:05.356
He will always be with us.

17:05.392 --> 17:07.258
Like dad.

17:13.066 --> 17:16.934
Maybe it's time
to bring in some help.

17:16.970 --> 17:20.204
Just let me
put up a sign tomorrow.

17:21.674 --> 17:22.473
-Okay.
-Okay.

17:22.509 --> 17:25.977
You go home,
let me clear some paths.

17:26.012 --> 17:26.844
No, that's what I'm here for.

17:28.281 --> 17:28.980
I've missed this place,

17:29.015 --> 17:32.216
and I'd like to soak it all in.

17:35.755 --> 17:36.921
It's gonna be okay.

17:36.956 --> 17:38.556
Okay.

17:54.307 --> 17:55.306
Grandpa,

17:55.341 --> 17:58.943
so many times I've wished
I could hear your voice,

17:58.978 --> 18:03.014
but never more than
this holiday, right now.

18:03.049 --> 18:05.416
A wish is
when you say out loud

18:05.452 --> 18:07.452
what what's in your heart.

18:11.157 --> 18:15.426
Grandpa, if you're listening...

18:20.366 --> 18:23.301
I wish I had
five more minutes with you.

18:37.884 --> 18:41.519
[♪♪♪]

18:54.567 --> 18:56.234
[doorbells jingling]

18:56.269 --> 18:57.835
we're not quite open!

19:00.306 --> 19:02.073
[man] hello? Hello?

19:04.410 --> 19:07.645
Hey, I'm so sorry,
but we're not open yet.

19:07.680 --> 19:08.346
Oh, sorry.

19:08.381 --> 19:10.047
I saw the sign in the window.

19:10.083 --> 19:11.048
You still hiring?

19:11.084 --> 19:14.118
I... I just put that there.

19:14.154 --> 19:16.721
I came by last summer
to see if you needed anyone,

19:16.756 --> 19:18.890
but I guess summer
isn't the busy season.

19:18.925 --> 19:22.727
I talked to an old man,
super nice.

19:22.762 --> 19:25.096
That's probably
my grandpa.

19:26.766 --> 19:28.933
He told me to come back
on my winter break.

19:28.968 --> 19:31.736
Uh, is... Is he here?

19:31.771 --> 19:34.238
He's, um...

19:34.274 --> 19:35.039
No longer with us.

19:36.209 --> 19:36.974
I'm sorry.

19:37.010 --> 19:40.678
Uh, what'd you say
your name was?

19:40.713 --> 19:42.180
Jay.

19:42.215 --> 19:43.748
Do you have a resume, jay?

19:43.783 --> 19:46.684
Uh, not on me,

19:46.719 --> 19:49.654
but I told your grandpa
I'm a hard worker,

19:49.689 --> 19:52.256
and he said that he would trade
genius for hard work any day.

19:52.292 --> 19:54.091
That sounds just like him.

19:54.127 --> 19:56.627
He, uh, told me
to check back?

19:57.897 --> 20:00.164
Grandpa jerry's opinion
is good for me.

20:00.200 --> 20:01.098
Clara.

20:02.468 --> 20:03.534
Welcome aboard.

20:03.570 --> 20:05.102
You won't regret it, clara.

20:05.138 --> 20:07.138
Um, so, how can I help?

20:07.173 --> 20:09.941
Well, my mom is on her way in

20:09.976 --> 20:11.442
to take care
of some of the deliveries.

20:11.477 --> 20:13.211
I can take those
off her plate.

20:13.246 --> 20:15.213
Yeah, this... This way?

20:15.248 --> 20:17.348
Wait, um...

20:17.383 --> 20:19.951
I must warn you, it's chaos.

20:19.986 --> 20:23.187
Then I came
just at the right time.

[playing "jingle bells"]

20:29.896 --> 20:32.163

Hi!

Merry christmas!

20:36.536 --> 20:38.502
Oh! You already did all that?

20:38.538 --> 20:40.371
Yeah, I like to be efficient.

20:40.406 --> 20:42.473
Oh! Um... Before I forget,

20:42.508 --> 20:45.643
I found this on the floor
near one of the boxes.

20:45.678 --> 20:47.411
Looks like a journal?

20:47.447 --> 20:48.980
Sorry, I didn't mean to pry.

20:49.015 --> 20:50.081
I just thought
you might like to have it.

20:50.116 --> 20:51.549
And I'll be back soon.

20:51.584 --> 20:52.650
[clara] thank you.

20:52.685 --> 20:54.685
I didn't see it last night.

20:55.455 --> 20:56.120
[doorbells jingling]

20:56.155 --> 20:59.557
this is... Grandpa's journal?

[chuckling]

21:06.366 --> 21:08.866
"I'll never forget the first
time I laid eyes on martha."

21:35.728 --> 21:36.494
I can't remember the last time

21:36.529 --> 21:39.463
I drank the entire
cup of coffee.

21:39.499 --> 21:41.465
Ohh... Hmm...

21:41.501 --> 21:43.601
I saved you
the last piece of pie.

21:43.636 --> 21:45.269
Ha! Gone now.

21:45.305 --> 21:46.103
Thanks for opening.

21:46.139 --> 21:47.371
Mm-hmm.

21:47.407 --> 21:48.439
Hey, do we know
a woman named martha?

21:48.474 --> 21:50.541
Oh, please tell me she's not
a customer I forgot.

21:50.576 --> 21:52.209
[laughing]

21:52.245 --> 21:53.277
no, nothing like that.

21:53.313 --> 21:54.278
Then, no.

21:54.314 --> 21:56.447
And I'm gonna get straight
to the deliveries.

21:56.482 --> 21:57.381
Actually, I handled that.

21:57.417 --> 21:59.650
I hired someone part-time,

21:59.686 --> 22:01.319
a student that
grandpa met last summer.

22:01.354 --> 22:02.353
Already?

22:03.656 --> 22:05.623
Grandpa never mentioned
a student.

22:05.658 --> 22:08.059
Well, he seems
super on the ball.

22:08.094 --> 22:10.728
He's a little quirky,
but polite,

22:10.763 --> 22:12.630
and he's already
out there making deliveries.

22:12.665 --> 22:14.799
Well, in that case,

22:14.834 --> 22:16.634
I'll use the time
to start the pantry.

22:16.669 --> 22:18.069
In that case,

22:18.104 --> 22:20.671
why don't you
take the morning off,

22:20.707 --> 22:21.806
and let me be in charge
for a bit?

22:21.841 --> 22:25.109
I can't take the morning off.

22:25.144 --> 22:26.077
Seriously, mom.

22:26.112 --> 22:26.777
When's the last time

22:26.813 --> 22:27.812
you took some time for yourself?

22:29.782 --> 22:31.015
Well, I... I would like

22:31.050 --> 22:33.084
to check out the...

22:33.119 --> 22:36.253
The new christmas market.

22:36.289 --> 22:38.923
Come on. You can do it.

22:38.958 --> 22:40.257
Okay.

Race you!

23:42.555 --> 23:43.421
[man] excuse me?

23:43.456 --> 23:44.255
-Yes?

23:44.290 --> 23:45.423
Do you have
any doctor ornaments?

23:45.458 --> 23:46.724
I have a six-year-old daughter

23:46.759 --> 23:48.092
who is determined
to be a surgeon.

23:48.127 --> 23:51.028
I love that.

23:58.871 --> 24:00.938
[man] is eating barbecue
a christmas tradition?

24:00.973 --> 24:02.873
It's a north carolina
tradition.

24:04.811 --> 24:06.577
Well, okay,
but who can explain

24:06.612 --> 24:08.612
dill pickles, pumpkin pie,

24:08.648 --> 24:10.681
and the band kiss
as ornaments?

24:10.716 --> 24:13.784
You've never seen the kiss
"white christmas" video?

24:13.820 --> 24:14.852
I've never met anyone

24:14.887 --> 24:18.022
who knew there was
a white christmas video by kiss.

24:18.057 --> 24:19.557
Well, hello, nice to meet you.

A southern tradition.

I travel a lot for work.

24:32.472 --> 24:33.504
Please tell me

24:33.539 --> 24:36.540
it's to taste food
from every part of the world.

24:36.576 --> 24:37.608
I sell software.

24:37.643 --> 24:38.876
Too bad.

24:38.911 --> 24:41.378
So you're here for work?

24:41.414 --> 24:43.614
My mom.

24:43.649 --> 24:45.382
Uh, she had a stroke.

24:45.418 --> 24:46.951
I was taking care of her

24:46.986 --> 24:48.619
until she passed
three months ago.

24:48.654 --> 24:50.421
Aw, I'm so sorry.

24:51.791 --> 24:53.624
I lost my father-in-law in June.

24:53.659 --> 24:54.725
You were close?

24:54.760 --> 24:58.229
Very. Sounds like you were too.

24:58.264 --> 25:00.498
She was the craziest woman
I ever met,

25:00.533 --> 25:01.832
and I mean that as a compliment.

25:01.868 --> 25:04.001
I wouldn't
have been anywhere else.

25:04.036 --> 25:06.604
She was the world's best mom.

25:06.639 --> 25:08.772
But you've been here
three months?

25:08.808 --> 25:10.474
Getting things in order.

25:11.878 --> 25:13.277
I've also enjoyed
getting to know

25:13.312 --> 25:14.411
the town my mother
fell in love with.

25:15.715 --> 25:16.580
It's been hard to leave.

25:16.616 --> 25:17.448
Edward!

25:19.952 --> 25:20.684
I promised the folks

25:20.720 --> 25:22.653
at the community
association booth

25:22.688 --> 25:24.522
that I'd stop by.

25:24.557 --> 25:25.990
My mom was a supporter.

25:26.025 --> 25:27.424
Wait, was your mom diana?

25:27.460 --> 25:28.826
Yes.

25:28.861 --> 25:30.494
I volunteered there a lot

25:30.530 --> 25:32.696
until things got rough
this year.

25:32.732 --> 25:35.499
We... We did
a tree-planting project.

25:35.535 --> 25:37.935
-Right.
-And she was crazy.

25:37.970 --> 25:40.437
In... In the best way.

25:42.742 --> 25:43.974
Their charity auction's
coming up,

25:44.010 --> 25:45.976
and there's a meeting tomorrow,

25:46.012 --> 25:47.211
if you wanted
to get back involved.

25:47.246 --> 25:50.948
We could use some more people
in the decorating committee.

25:50.983 --> 25:52.149
I think I remember

25:52.184 --> 25:54.618
writing that down
on my calendar...

25:54.654 --> 25:56.687
Uh, six months ago.

25:56.722 --> 25:58.022
Wonder where that calendar is.

25:58.057 --> 26:00.424
Well, if you find it,
I hope to see you.

26:02.762 --> 26:04.962
Maybe this one,
to match your boots?

26:06.198 --> 26:07.831
[chuckling]

26:18.711 --> 26:20.844
[doorbells jingling]

26:21.747 --> 26:23.514
-oh. Hi.
-Hi.

26:24.917 --> 26:27.318
Uh, tell frankie
we said congrats.

26:27.353 --> 26:28.185
Thank you!

26:29.722 --> 26:33.223
Um, doing
a little christmas shopping?

26:33.259 --> 26:35.492
Mm-hmm, I need
a few pounds of peppermint bark,

26:35.528 --> 26:37.161
two dozen gingerbread men,

26:37.196 --> 26:38.996
all the snowman cake pops
you've got,

26:39.031 --> 26:40.831
and, of course,
candy cane cookies.

26:40.866 --> 26:42.166
They're all for you,
aren't they?

26:42.201 --> 26:43.934
Well, unless you're interested
in sharing some.

26:43.970 --> 26:46.070
Well, you are in luck.

26:46.105 --> 26:47.371
New candy cane cookies
are ready.

26:47.406 --> 26:48.872
You want a warm one?

26:48.908 --> 26:50.074
Does anyone say no to that?

26:50.109 --> 26:53.043
-Mm-mm.
-Mm. Mm-hmm.

26:59.785 --> 27:01.919
[clara] it needs
new batteries, I think.

27:01.954 --> 27:03.454
[logan] those the cookies?

27:03.489 --> 27:04.355
How many do you want?

27:04.390 --> 27:05.189
All of them.

27:05.224 --> 27:07.891
They're actually
for military might.

27:07.927 --> 27:09.693
We're putting together
christmas baskets

27:09.729 --> 27:10.861
for the families,

27:10.896 --> 27:12.296
and I thought
I'd bring the treats.

27:12.331 --> 27:13.731
That's really nice.

27:13.766 --> 27:16.066
Well, it can be tough
around the holidays.

27:16.102 --> 27:18.869
Uh, your gingerbread house

27:18.904 --> 27:20.571
has a bit
of structural damage there.

27:20.606 --> 27:21.705
Yeah.

27:21.741 --> 27:23.240
I am a contractor.

27:23.275 --> 27:24.608
I'm good.

27:24.644 --> 27:26.377
You don't want
that roof caving in

27:26.412 --> 27:28.679
on innocent gingerbread
people, do you?

27:30.583 --> 27:32.549
I'm fully bonded and insured.

27:36.989 --> 27:39.590
Oh, come on,
you remember that look,

27:39.625 --> 27:42.726
the one that said that you were
his one and only granddaughter,

27:42.762 --> 27:43.761
and I was...

27:43.796 --> 27:45.796
...Taking me out
on my first date?

27:45.831 --> 27:47.097
-Mm-hmm.
-Mm-hmm.

27:47.133 --> 27:48.799
He did give us
the fairlane, though.

27:48.834 --> 27:50.834
No, he gave you the fairlane.

27:50.870 --> 27:52.936
He gave me the look.

27:54.640 --> 27:56.440
[chuckling]

27:56.475 --> 27:58.075
that's it.

27:58.110 --> 27:59.743
I admit, I was scared,

27:59.779 --> 28:02.446
and with that
military background...

28:07.620 --> 28:08.519
Clara...

28:08.554 --> 28:10.154
The way I enlisted...

28:10.189 --> 28:12.790
I... I know
it's been a long time,

28:12.825 --> 28:14.024
but I always wanted
the chance to...

28:14.060 --> 28:14.925
[doorbells jingling]

28:14.960 --> 28:16.160
deliveries complete!

28:18.364 --> 28:19.697
Sorry. Hi.

28:19.732 --> 28:20.531
Uh, anything else for today?

28:20.566 --> 28:21.498
All set.

28:22.501 --> 28:23.367
Maybe we can go through

28:23.402 --> 28:24.601
the inventory
in the pantry tomorrow.

28:24.637 --> 28:25.869
Sounds like a plan.

28:25.905 --> 28:27.204
[clara] thank you.

28:27.239 --> 28:29.039
Oh, um, I don't know
if you saw,

28:29.075 --> 28:30.140
but there's a big
christmas tree lighting

28:30.176 --> 28:31.175
happening at the market tonight.

28:32.478 --> 28:33.310
It seems pretty neat.

28:33.345 --> 28:35.446
[chuckling]

28:35.481 --> 28:37.314
I can't remember the last time
I went to that tree lighting.

28:38.818 --> 28:41.285
Well, don't let
your big chance go by!

28:41.320 --> 28:42.486
See you later.

28:42.521 --> 28:43.387
[doorbells jingling]

28:43.422 --> 28:44.121
do I know that guy?

28:44.156 --> 28:46.323
New holiday hire.

28:46.358 --> 28:49.460
Maybe you've seen him
around town?

28:49.495 --> 28:53.363
You know, that tree lighting
is usually... Pretty neat.

28:53.399 --> 28:54.965
[chuckling]

28:55.000 --> 28:58.535
would you want to go there
with me tonight?

29:07.780 --> 29:09.713
's just a tree lighting.

29:09.749 --> 29:12.249
I haven't seen it in years.

29:12.284 --> 29:14.918
Look, I know
you never liked logan...

29:14.954 --> 29:16.153
No, I loved him.

29:16.188 --> 29:19.790
What I didn't like
was the way he left,

29:19.825 --> 29:20.691
and neither did you.

29:21.927 --> 29:23.560
He didn't leave, mom.

29:23.596 --> 29:24.962
He joined the army.

29:24.997 --> 29:28.999
And didn't tell you
until after he enlisted.

29:29.034 --> 29:30.734
You were devastated.

29:30.770 --> 29:34.438
He chose that life,

29:34.473 --> 29:35.272
and good for him,

29:35.307 --> 29:38.075
but you have
a different life now,

29:38.110 --> 29:40.010
with a great guy in chicago.

29:40.045 --> 29:41.945
Everything's fine.

29:41.981 --> 29:43.113
Don't worry.

29:49.622 --> 29:52.489
[♪♪♪]

29:55.895 --> 29:57.928
how go the second graders?

29:57.963 --> 30:01.365
Oh, they're incredible.

30:01.400 --> 30:02.933
They just haven't gotten
to the place

30:02.968 --> 30:04.368
where they filter
or second-guess,

30:04.403 --> 30:07.371
so their creativity
is just off the charts,

30:07.406 --> 30:10.641
and their willingness
to try and fail

30:10.676 --> 30:12.843
is just...

30:12.878 --> 30:14.178
It's so inspiring.

30:14.213 --> 30:18.115
You haven't changed a bit.

30:18.150 --> 30:19.116
I always knew

30:19.151 --> 30:21.351
you were going to be
this kind of art teacher,

30:21.387 --> 30:24.288
inspiring the next gen
of picassos and o'keeffes.

30:25.991 --> 30:27.124
Did I say something wrong?

30:27.159 --> 30:28.859
Oh, no, no, no, no.

30:28.894 --> 30:30.494
It's just, um...

30:32.998 --> 30:35.065
I'm being laid off.

30:35.100 --> 30:37.334
That's terrible.

30:37.369 --> 30:38.035
Yeah.

30:38.070 --> 30:38.969
But... But you're so talented.

30:39.004 --> 30:41.271
You'll find another position
right away.

30:42.575 --> 30:44.641
There's private schools,
and community centers,

30:44.677 --> 30:45.509
and colleges...

30:46.412 --> 30:49.379
Even... Even the army
has an art program.

30:49.415 --> 30:50.314
It does?

30:50.349 --> 30:51.648
Yeah, since world war I.

30:51.684 --> 30:53.183
Hmm.

30:54.420 --> 30:57.654
Maybe I looked it up
when I got there.

30:58.958 --> 31:00.691
Maybe I thought that...

31:05.197 --> 31:06.830
Any place would be
lucky to have you.

31:06.866 --> 31:08.565
You sound like my grandpa.

31:09.702 --> 31:10.667
He had a knack

31:10.703 --> 31:12.369
for saying the right thing
at the right time.

31:15.708 --> 31:17.007
The day he died,

31:17.042 --> 31:19.343
we were supposed to connect,

31:19.378 --> 31:22.346
have one of our epic chats,

31:22.381 --> 31:26.950
but when I called his phone,

31:26.986 --> 31:27.885
my mom answered.

31:27.920 --> 31:30.387
He'd just... Collapsed.

31:33.459 --> 31:35.392
And I keep wondering if...

31:35.427 --> 31:40.030
I would have called
just five minutes earlier,

31:40.065 --> 31:43.734
if I would have been able
to hear his voice one last time.

31:45.237 --> 31:48.372
I wish I knew
what he would say now.

31:48.407 --> 31:49.940
He would've asked you
his favorite question:

31:49.975 --> 31:52.075
"clara...

31:52.111 --> 31:55.512
What's in your heart?"

31:57.483 --> 31:58.015
I know.

31:58.050 --> 31:59.950
He did it for me too.

31:59.985 --> 32:03.520
Even after you and I split,
he was still in my life.

32:07.092 --> 32:08.926
Clara, I never meant
to hurt you...

32:08.961 --> 32:10.761
But I did,

32:10.796 --> 32:12.562
and I'm sorry.

32:14.700 --> 32:17.367
I wanted to say that
for such a long time...

32:19.104 --> 32:21.338
And I knew when I saw you again,

32:21.373 --> 32:22.639
I wouldn't
let that chance go by.

32:29.615 --> 32:30.414
[mc] welcome!

32:30.449 --> 32:31.581
Welcome, everyone!

32:31.617 --> 32:34.918
It's time we illuminate
this year's magnificent tree!

32:34.954 --> 32:36.853
Count it off with me!

32:36.889 --> 32:38.121
Five!

32:38.157 --> 32:39.122
Four!

32:39.158 --> 32:39.957
Three!

32:39.992 --> 32:41.024
Two!

32:41.060 --> 32:41.925
One!

32:41.961 --> 32:44.528
Merry christmas!

32:44.563 --> 32:47.297
[applause]

32:57.910 --> 32:59.643
screwdriver.

33:04.817 --> 33:06.650
Wow.

33:11.156 --> 33:13.490
Wow.

33:17.496 --> 33:18.362
Oh!

33:26.171 --> 33:27.204
[clara] so I just discovered

33:27.239 --> 33:29.473
grandpa used to keep a diary.

33:29.508 --> 33:32.009
There's a history
that I never even knew about.

33:33.579 --> 33:35.512
He fell in love
with a girl named martha

33:35.547 --> 33:36.380
when he was younger.

33:36.415 --> 33:39.383
But... Your grandma's
name was nell.

33:39.418 --> 33:41.551
-I know.
-Wow.

33:41.587 --> 33:43.687
So, was that
when he was in the army?

33:43.722 --> 33:46.156
No, I haven't even gotten
to the army part yet.

33:46.191 --> 33:48.558
Well, jerry always said
things happened for a reason,

33:48.594 --> 33:51.995
so maybe this journal
turned up now because...

33:52.031 --> 33:53.997
Because...?

33:54.033 --> 33:55.165
I have no idea.

33:55.200 --> 33:55.999
[laughing]

33:58.037 --> 33:59.936
well, you know,
I... I have it in the truck.

33:59.972 --> 34:03.273
You drive, I'll read?

34:03.308 --> 34:05.575
Maybe we can find some clues?

34:05.611 --> 34:07.377
Well, that sounds nice.

34:08.380 --> 34:10.514
After you.

34:13.652 --> 34:14.851
"...So I finally
worked up the nerve

34:14.887 --> 34:17.020
to invite martha
to the holiday formal.

34:17.056 --> 34:20.424
We'd been seeing each other
nearly every day for a month,

34:20.459 --> 34:23.026
but this would be
our first dance,

34:23.062 --> 34:25.062
and I was so nervous...

34:27.132 --> 34:28.732
...But she always
put me at ease,

34:28.767 --> 34:30.867
and always, always
found the joy.

34:32.738 --> 34:34.404
We talked and laughed all night.

34:34.440 --> 34:36.940
It felt like
we'd been together forever,

34:36.975 --> 34:39.709
we'd be together forever.

34:39.745 --> 34:43.580
I knew I wanted to spend
the rest of my life with her."

34:46.151 --> 34:47.384
oh. We're here.

34:47.419 --> 34:49.419
I was so into the story.

34:49.455 --> 34:51.421
Aw... It's so good.

34:51.457 --> 34:52.756
Whoa, whoa, whoa, no, no, no.

34:52.791 --> 34:54.391
I need to know
what happens next.

34:54.426 --> 34:55.325
[she laughs]

34:55.360 --> 34:56.560
no, I'm serious! Come on!

34:56.595 --> 34:59.329
I mean, do they go
on another date?

34:59.364 --> 35:01.498
Does he confess
his love for her?

35:01.533 --> 35:02.732
I need to know what happens.

35:04.203 --> 35:06.603
"how could I spoil everything

35:06.638 --> 35:09.439
by telling her when I turned 18,

35:09.475 --> 35:12.876
I'd be enlisting
in the army?"

35:21.620 --> 35:23.086
what did logan say
when you read him the part

35:23.122 --> 35:25.355
where your grandpa enlisted
and couldn't tell her?

35:25.390 --> 35:27.858
Logan brought up his enlisting

35:27.893 --> 35:28.925
before we even
got to the journal.

35:28.961 --> 35:29.659
Wow.

35:29.695 --> 35:31.094
He apologized.

35:31.130 --> 35:33.163
Well, that's big.

35:34.399 --> 35:35.298
What have you told blake?

35:35.334 --> 35:37.834
About logan?

35:37.870 --> 35:40.137
Mm...No. About the journal.

35:40.172 --> 35:41.972
Why? Is there something you
need to tell him about logan?

35:42.007 --> 35:43.240
No!

35:44.576 --> 35:45.942
[struggling with cookies]

35:45.978 --> 35:47.110
no. Um...

35:47.146 --> 35:48.712
Cookies.

35:48.747 --> 35:50.313
I hope bella's class
loves them.

35:55.087 --> 35:57.821
You did such an amazing job
on the office,

35:57.856 --> 36:00.957
that I thought I would
let you loose on this.

36:00.993 --> 36:02.125
[chuckling]

36:02.161 --> 36:03.560
[jay] of course.

36:03.595 --> 36:06.363
Clearly, my grandpa had a...

36:06.398 --> 36:07.364
"it's a mess,

36:07.399 --> 36:10.233
but I can put my hands
on everything" system.

36:10.269 --> 36:11.301
Problem is...

36:11.336 --> 36:12.536
Oh, without him,

36:12.571 --> 36:13.970
no one can put
their hands on anything.

36:15.774 --> 36:17.340
I'm sort of a whiz
at this kind of stuff,

36:17.376 --> 36:19.142
so it shouldn't take too long.

36:20.245 --> 36:22.879
And if you were looking to
get rid of some extra inventory,

36:22.915 --> 36:24.147
you could set up a booth

36:24.183 --> 36:25.849
at the christmas bazaar
this weekend.

36:25.884 --> 36:27.250
I forgot about
the christmas bazaar.

36:27.286 --> 36:28.685
Thank you.

36:28.720 --> 36:30.220
You are a godsend.

36:34.092 --> 36:34.991
Thank you.

36:36.295 --> 36:38.495
Thank you.

36:38.530 --> 36:40.830
To the official
decorating committee.

36:40.866 --> 36:42.666
I love the association,

36:42.701 --> 36:44.501
and I'm so glad
I could make the meeting,

36:44.536 --> 36:46.503
but their hot cocoa... Whoa.

36:46.538 --> 36:49.506
Is a christmas abomination.

36:49.541 --> 36:50.373
Wait till you try this.

36:52.211 --> 36:53.710
Cheers.

36:57.482 --> 36:58.748
Mm.

37:00.052 --> 37:01.218
Oh, it's good.

37:03.388 --> 37:04.187
You wouldn't have time

37:04.223 --> 37:05.755
for dinner sometime soon,
would you?

37:05.791 --> 37:08.491
Oh... Um...

37:09.761 --> 37:10.760
[chuckling]

37:10.796 --> 37:12.762
I'm so busy at the store...

37:12.798 --> 37:15.699
I... I run the christmas store
on maple,

37:15.734 --> 37:18.368
so the season...

37:18.403 --> 37:19.269
Perhaps after christmas, then?

37:20.806 --> 37:21.638
Or perhaps
you're seeing someone?

37:21.673 --> 37:23.406
No, no, I'm not...

37:25.677 --> 37:27.244
No, I haven't
done that for a while.

37:28.580 --> 37:29.412
I mean, can you tell?

37:29.448 --> 37:31.448
[laughing]

37:31.483 --> 37:32.616
oh...

37:32.651 --> 37:34.818
Think about it.

37:34.853 --> 37:37.654
In the meantime, tell me more
about the shop.

37:37.689 --> 37:39.055
Well, it's complete chaos,

37:39.091 --> 37:41.391
but it's also
the greatest place on earth.

37:41.426 --> 37:44.427
It's...
Been so important to me.

37:48.133 --> 37:49.199
[phone ringing]

37:51.103 --> 37:52.502
<i> hi!</i>

37:52.537 --> 37:54.004
Hey, finally! How's it going?

37:54.039 --> 37:56.239
Sorry... It's just been
really busy.

37:56.275 --> 37:57.507
Yeah, I bet the store
is crammed.

37:57.542 --> 37:58.408
<i> Yeah.</i>

37:58.443 --> 37:59.743
[struggling]

37:59.778 --> 38:01.645
<i> um, so are you just packing?</i>

38:01.680 --> 38:03.580
Yeah, I got my routes,

38:03.615 --> 38:05.115
map, timing,

38:05.150 --> 38:07.284
even got my christmas
sports movies chosen...

38:10.555 --> 38:11.821
That's... Where you say

38:11.857 --> 38:13.623
"there are
no christmas sports movies,"

38:13.659 --> 38:15.292
and I explain that
ivan drago fought rocky

38:15.327 --> 38:16.293
on christmas day.

38:16.328 --> 38:18.194
You know what the army's
good for? Multi-tasking.

38:18.230 --> 38:20.664
Let me help you out
there, g.I. Jane.

38:20.699 --> 38:21.998
<i> Hey, blake, I'm so sorry.</i>

38:22.034 --> 38:24.200
<i> Do you mind if I, um,</i>
<i> call you later?</i>

38:24.236 --> 38:26.970
We're, uh, I'm selling some
stuff at a christmas bazaar,

38:27.005 --> 38:28.772
and I kind of need both hands
to get organized.

38:28.807 --> 38:30.440
<i> Uh, can I call you later?</i>

38:30.475 --> 38:33.443
Uh, of course. Yeah.

38:33.478 --> 38:34.344
<i> Yeah, I'll catch you then.</i>

38:34.379 --> 38:36.112
Okay. Okay.

38:36.148 --> 38:37.147
Who's blake?

38:37.182 --> 38:41.117
He is, um...

38:41.153 --> 38:45.288
My boyfriend, in, uh, chicago.

38:45.324 --> 38:46.489
Oh.

38:48.226 --> 38:50.193
Is it serious?

38:52.497 --> 38:53.496
-Is that clara?

38:53.532 --> 38:55.231
Hi!

38:55.267 --> 38:56.132
Look at you!

38:56.168 --> 38:58.301
Aw!

38:58.337 --> 39:01.304
Logan's been talking
about you nonstop.

39:01.340 --> 39:02.339
Not non-stop. Mom.

39:02.374 --> 39:03.640
It wasn't. I mean...

39:03.675 --> 39:04.908
Hush.

39:04.943 --> 39:07.877
He said you look wonderful,
and you do,

39:07.913 --> 39:09.813
and your poor
dear grandfather,

39:09.848 --> 39:11.548
I was so sorry
to hear about him.

39:11.583 --> 39:14.718
I bet your mom
is up to her ears.

39:14.753 --> 39:15.852
She is.

39:15.887 --> 39:17.887
Well, tell bonnie I said hi.

39:17.923 --> 39:21.491
We'll be gone seeing my baby's
baby over christmas,

39:21.526 --> 39:23.159
denise had another,

39:23.195 --> 39:26.062
but let's reconnect
after. Promise?

39:26.098 --> 39:28.365
Promise.
It's so good to see you.

39:35.307 --> 39:37.674
Listen. Can I take you
someplace tonight?

39:37.709 --> 39:39.376
Logan...

39:39.411 --> 39:40.510
It's not what you think.

39:40.545 --> 39:43.380
I want to take you someplace...

39:43.415 --> 39:44.881
Unconventional.

39:46.718 --> 39:48.017
-I'm seeing someone.
-It's not that.

39:48.053 --> 39:52.021
It's one old friend
to another, saying,

39:52.057 --> 39:55.892
"hop in the car,
let me take you somewhere."

39:57.629 --> 39:58.528
right?

39:58.563 --> 40:00.029
All right.

40:01.633 --> 40:06.903
Perks of being a contractor
working on our old school.

40:06.938 --> 40:09.739
You weren't expecting this,
were you?

40:09.775 --> 40:10.907
Time flies.

40:10.942 --> 40:13.076
The clocks don't stop.

40:13.111 --> 40:14.043
Come on.

40:22.087 --> 40:25.221
They kept the ceiling art
you fought for.

40:25.257 --> 40:27.290
We fought for.

40:27.325 --> 40:29.893
First time
I ever took a stand.

40:29.928 --> 40:31.461
You were so adamant

40:31.496 --> 40:37.567
that kids have
a place to express themselves.

40:37.602 --> 40:41.104
I know you're worried about
separating from your school,

40:41.139 --> 40:45.074
but you've been
inspiring students

40:45.110 --> 40:47.310
since we were this age.

40:47.345 --> 40:49.412
You'll find a place
to do it again.

40:49.448 --> 40:52.415
This is where
you wanted to bring me?

40:55.620 --> 40:56.920
Your unconventional outing?

40:56.955 --> 40:59.923
I thought about
what jerry would do.

40:59.958 --> 41:03.092
How he'd remind you that
the art teacher that you are

41:03.128 --> 41:06.963
isn't tied to
a place or a school...

41:10.836 --> 41:12.769
It's inside you.

41:12.804 --> 41:16.139
It's who you are.

41:25.484 --> 41:27.984
Who you've always been.

41:42.200 --> 41:43.967
-There we go...
-Wow.

41:44.002 --> 41:46.369
You're good with lights.

41:46.404 --> 41:50.073
It shows you grew up
in a christmas store.

41:50.108 --> 41:53.176
Oh, I...I didn't grow up
in the confectionery.

41:53.211 --> 41:54.244
No?

41:54.279 --> 41:56.179
No.

41:56.214 --> 41:59.916
My, uh, husband, danny,

41:59.951 --> 42:01.985
was killed serving overseas,

42:02.020 --> 42:05.822
and jerry just
took clara and I in,

42:05.857 --> 42:08.825
and he said, "we're family.

42:08.860 --> 42:10.393
We'll get through this
together,"

42:10.428 --> 42:12.328
and I've been
at the confectionery ever since.

42:13.431 --> 42:15.932
You're different
than I thought.

42:15.967 --> 42:18.735
You said you sell software.

42:18.770 --> 42:19.702
I looked you up.

42:19.738 --> 42:22.071
You sell software companies.

42:22.107 --> 42:23.573
Why didn't you tell me?

42:23.608 --> 42:25.408
I didn't want
to be treated differently.

42:25.443 --> 42:27.110
People here
have connected with me

42:27.145 --> 42:28.177
because they knew my mother,

42:28.213 --> 42:31.414
or because they like
the vietnamese food I make,

42:31.449 --> 42:32.916
not because they were looking
for some big sale

42:32.951 --> 42:35.785
or an introduction to someone.

42:35.820 --> 42:37.954
You make vietnamese food?

42:37.989 --> 42:39.589
[laughing]

42:44.296 --> 42:46.696
I can not stop thinking
about those young artists

42:46.731 --> 42:48.064
and what they created.

42:48.099 --> 42:49.866
Yeah. You know,
it's hard to believe

42:49.901 --> 42:52.402
they were the same age
your granddad was

42:52.437 --> 42:53.369
in his journal.

42:53.405 --> 42:55.905
I mean, what happened
with him and martha

42:55.941 --> 42:56.739
when he shipped out?

42:56.775 --> 42:58.207
Do you know?

42:58.243 --> 43:01.578
Mm-mm. No.
I haven't gotten that far.

43:04.583 --> 43:05.415
Wanna find out?

43:05.450 --> 43:06.382
Mm-hmm.

43:06.418 --> 43:07.050
[laughing]

43:07.085 --> 43:08.284
read me more.

43:10.121 --> 43:12.221
"that day we said goodbye
at the station

43:12.257 --> 43:15.858
was the first time I ever
saw tears in martha's eyes."

43:28.373 --> 43:30.573
it was the service
that kept them apart.

43:31.476 --> 43:32.308
Mom!

43:33.178 --> 43:34.444
You remember logan.

43:34.479 --> 43:35.445
Sure.

43:36.815 --> 43:40.016
...And... And this is edward.

43:40.051 --> 43:41.451
Pleasure to meet you.

43:41.486 --> 43:42.785
Likewise.

43:50.061 --> 43:51.794
[both] I didn't know
you were going on a date.

43:51.830 --> 43:52.996
-It wasn't a date!
-It wasn't a date.

43:53.031 --> 43:55.765
-It's fine if it was a date!
-Tell me what it was, then.

43:55.800 --> 43:57.166
It was two old friends
hanging out.

43:57.202 --> 43:58.835
What do you call it?

43:58.870 --> 44:03.139
We were doing decorations
for the association,

44:03.174 --> 44:04.941
I always wear lipstick,

44:04.976 --> 44:06.876
and don't change the subject.

44:06.911 --> 44:08.444
He seems nice.

44:09.848 --> 44:10.880
Where'd you meet?

44:10.915 --> 44:15.485
At the christmas market
you forced me to go to!

44:15.520 --> 44:16.452
I'm happy for you.

44:16.488 --> 44:18.688
I mean, when's the last time
you went out?

44:20.592 --> 44:21.991
I don't know.

44:22.027 --> 44:24.193
I was nervous the whole time,

44:24.229 --> 44:25.895
and he wants to see me again,

44:25.930 --> 44:27.463
and dating has never
really worked out,

44:27.499 --> 44:28.164
so that's over,

44:28.199 --> 44:30.667
and, uh... Tell me about you.

44:30.702 --> 44:31.868
Me?

44:31.903 --> 44:34.637
You've seen logan
practically every day

44:34.673 --> 44:35.838
since you've been here.

44:35.874 --> 44:36.673
Nothing's going on.

44:36.708 --> 44:37.974
Nothing?

44:38.009 --> 44:39.709
Or ♪ nothing ♪?

44:39.744 --> 44:42.645
Nothing is going on
with blake.

44:42.681 --> 44:43.646
I mean, logan.

44:43.682 --> 44:45.648
Nothing is going on with logan.

44:48.953 --> 44:49.786
I'm gonna go call blake.

44:54.426 --> 44:56.826
<i> [blake] hey, sorry I missed</i>
<i> your call earlier.</i>

44:56.861 --> 44:58.561
Oh, it's fine,
it's been non-stop.

44:58.596 --> 45:00.063
So, tell me how it's going.

45:00.098 --> 45:01.698
<i> How was the big game?</i>

45:01.733 --> 45:04.267
Well, mom threw an interception
that ended the game,

45:04.302 --> 45:07.270
so we had to trade her
to the other side for next year.

45:07.305 --> 45:08.071
<i> So, listen,</i>
<i> I'm glad you called.</i>

45:08.106 --> 45:09.505
I have some good news.

45:09.541 --> 45:10.373
I found out that westend

45:10.408 --> 45:10.940
is looking
for a second-grade teacher

45:10.975 --> 45:11.941
for english and history.

45:11.976 --> 45:14.777
Oh. Oh, that's...

45:14.813 --> 45:17.013
<i> I think you should</i>
<i> apply for it.</i>

45:17.048 --> 45:20.550
Me? An english
and history teacher?

45:20.585 --> 45:23.686
Yeah, yeah, I emailed you
the application link.

45:23.722 --> 45:25.955
But... I teach art.

45:25.990 --> 45:27.256
<i> Teaching is teaching.</i>

45:27.292 --> 45:27.957
You know?

45:27.992 --> 45:29.058
It's just another job, right?

45:29.094 --> 45:31.294
Sure. Um...

45:31.329 --> 45:33.629
Besides, that way, we could...

45:33.665 --> 45:34.430
Keep working together.

45:36.267 --> 45:37.533
Listen, blake, I...

45:37.569 --> 45:40.069
Oh, hey, they're
putting dinner down.

45:40.105 --> 45:41.070
I... I should...

45:41.106 --> 45:42.271
Oh, oh, yeah.

45:42.307 --> 45:43.372
I can... I can call you later.

45:43.408 --> 45:44.540
<i> Bye.</i>

45:44.576 --> 45:45.742
<i> Love you. Bye.</i>

45:52.584 --> 45:53.850
[sighing]

45:59.023 --> 45:59.822
[kelly] teach english?

45:59.858 --> 46:01.424
And history.

46:01.459 --> 46:04.594
Oh, but you're an art teacher.

46:04.629 --> 46:06.963
Exactly. It's not just a job.
It's...

46:06.998 --> 46:09.098
...Who you are
and always have been?

46:11.469 --> 46:12.702
That's exactly
what logan said.

46:13.972 --> 46:15.571
So you're seeing
more of each other.

46:15.607 --> 46:16.239
Kel...

46:16.274 --> 46:18.775
Why did you send me an sos?

46:20.345 --> 46:22.278
Blake is going to propose.

46:23.448 --> 46:24.480
Clara!

46:24.516 --> 46:26.282
[chuckling]

46:26.317 --> 46:27.750
oh no.

46:27.786 --> 46:30.119
Look, he's... He's a great guy.

46:30.155 --> 46:31.954
He really is.

46:31.990 --> 46:34.023
There are so many "buts"
in that sentence.

46:34.058 --> 46:35.625
"he's a great guy"... But?

46:35.660 --> 46:36.793
But... But I don't know!

46:38.329 --> 46:39.962
Everything was fine,

46:39.998 --> 46:42.632
and then the second
I saw that ring box...

46:42.667 --> 46:45.334
I went ice cold.

46:47.071 --> 46:48.805
I thought
it would feel different,

46:48.840 --> 46:50.173
and then ever since it happened,

46:50.208 --> 46:51.607
all I have are questions.

46:53.978 --> 46:55.178
Look, it's the same night

46:55.213 --> 46:56.946
that I lost my job,

46:56.981 --> 46:58.614
and then it's her
first christmas

46:58.650 --> 46:59.549
without grandpa,

46:59.584 --> 47:01.484
so maybe...

47:01.519 --> 47:03.986
And what would
grandpa jerry say?

47:04.022 --> 47:04.854
He would say...

47:04.889 --> 47:08.624
Clara, ask yourself
one question...

47:10.161 --> 47:13.329
"what is in your heart?"

47:14.899 --> 47:17.333
if only he were here.

47:21.005 --> 47:23.139
"I heard the mail was in,

47:23.174 --> 47:25.708
and there was
a big package for me.

47:25.743 --> 47:27.643
I was sure it would be
letters from martha,

47:27.679 --> 47:29.412
but when I got there,

47:29.447 --> 47:31.981
all my cards came back unopened.

47:32.016 --> 47:33.482
I didn't understand.

47:33.518 --> 47:35.151
We fell so hard.

47:35.186 --> 47:38.788
Was I wrong...
About everything?"

47:41.626 --> 47:42.725
aw...

47:42.760 --> 47:44.527
What happened, grandpa?

47:47.031 --> 47:49.465
What happened
to your first big love?

47:57.909 --> 47:58.875
Wow.

48:00.879 --> 48:01.844
I know.

48:01.880 --> 48:04.780
I also made maple bacon
and cinnamon coffee.

48:04.816 --> 48:06.215
[clara] what, no pies?

48:06.251 --> 48:07.083
Check the oven.

48:07.118 --> 48:10.253
[laughing]

48:10.288 --> 48:14.590
I couldn't sleep
last night, um, so...

48:14.626 --> 48:16.025
Are we good?

48:16.060 --> 48:17.360
Always.

48:18.463 --> 48:19.095
So, um...

48:19.130 --> 48:21.697
What...

48:21.733 --> 48:23.366
What happened here?

48:23.401 --> 48:24.533
I tried to clean up.

48:24.569 --> 48:25.601
[laughing]

48:27.105 --> 48:30.106
those are organized
piles of piles.

48:30.141 --> 48:31.107
Don't make fun.

48:31.142 --> 48:34.944
All I'm saying is
if you keep living in chaos,

48:34.979 --> 48:38.214
then you're not going
to have room for anything else.

48:38.249 --> 48:39.615
What do I need room for?

48:39.651 --> 48:41.584
Saying yes
to a second date with edward?

48:41.619 --> 48:44.687
Or... Whatever
comes next in life.

48:47.926 --> 48:50.760
Uh, I gotta... Open the store.

48:52.330 --> 48:55.064
This time, you go out.

48:55.099 --> 48:55.998
Go... Go shopping.

48:56.034 --> 48:57.600
Take the morning off.

48:57.635 --> 48:59.068
[sighing]

48:59.103 --> 49:02.004
I heard you. Okay?

49:02.040 --> 49:04.573
I'll think about what you said.

49:04.609 --> 49:05.741
Thank you.

49:17.488 --> 49:18.321
Oh, jay!

49:18.356 --> 49:19.522
Wow, sorry, sorry!

49:19.557 --> 49:21.424
I wasn't looking
where I was going.

49:21.459 --> 49:23.125
Actually, I was just doing
some christmas shopping

49:23.161 --> 49:24.627
before I head in.

49:24.662 --> 49:26.429
I was going to stop
at the hardware store

49:26.464 --> 49:28.597
and grab some extra batteries
for the candy cane train,

49:28.633 --> 49:30.166
and I... I lost track of time.

49:30.201 --> 49:31.033
I can pick 'em up.

49:31.069 --> 49:32.101
-Are you sure?
-Yeah!

49:32.136 --> 49:32.969
No, I can come back later.

49:33.004 --> 49:34.503
They're right there.

49:34.539 --> 49:35.538
Plus, my mom's in the shop,

49:35.573 --> 49:37.807
and she's... She's
really excited to meet you.

49:37.842 --> 49:38.607
Okay, great.

49:38.643 --> 49:39.842
Well, I will see you
later, then?

49:39.877 --> 49:40.843
Bye!

49:42.680 --> 49:44.180
-Hey!
-Hey.

49:44.215 --> 49:47.483
I thought I would
just grab some batteries,

49:47.518 --> 49:49.385
see if I can get that
candy cane express train going.

49:49.420 --> 49:50.319
What are you picking up?

49:50.355 --> 49:51.387
Batteries, to see

49:51.422 --> 49:53.622
if I can get that candy cane
express train going.

49:57.528 --> 49:58.728
Well, if the batteries
don't work,

49:58.763 --> 50:00.496
I could always
take a shot at fixing it.

50:00.531 --> 50:01.464
Are you heading in now?

50:01.499 --> 50:03.966
Actually, my mom's
covering for the morning.

50:04.002 --> 50:06.135
I was gonna sneak out
and do a little extra shopping.

50:06.170 --> 50:07.069
Why?

50:07.105 --> 50:08.404
Uh, nothing.

50:08.439 --> 50:11.307
They just gave me
a really nice tree

50:11.342 --> 50:12.775
from the lot,

50:12.810 --> 50:16.245
and it's... It's very bare
right now.

50:16.280 --> 50:18.814
Actually, I don't know
if you've heard this,

50:18.850 --> 50:21.717
but, um, art activities
are kinda my jam.

50:22.653 --> 50:26.355
Um, and christmas
art activities? Well...

50:26.391 --> 50:28.424
[laughing]

50:28.459 --> 50:30.326
welcome to my humble abode.

50:36.000 --> 50:36.766
Impressive.

50:36.801 --> 50:39.268
You were expecting
bean bag chairs,

50:39.303 --> 50:42.471
dirty clothes everywhere,
and a video game console, huh?

50:42.507 --> 50:44.040
In my defense,

50:44.075 --> 50:46.609
that is what your old basement
used to look like.

50:46.644 --> 50:49.278
I've been making
military beds for years.

50:49.313 --> 50:50.279
Oh, here.

50:50.314 --> 50:51.313
Oh, how's denise?

50:51.349 --> 50:54.150
Your mom said she was, um,
having another baby?

50:54.185 --> 50:55.284
Her... Her second?

50:55.319 --> 50:56.819
Third.

50:56.854 --> 50:58.521
Oh...

50:58.556 --> 50:59.722
[chuckling]

50:59.757 --> 51:01.323
wait, so does that mean
you're...

51:01.359 --> 51:02.358
You're alone for christmas?

51:02.393 --> 51:03.626
Yeah, I mean,

51:03.661 --> 51:05.327
it's a busy season
for military might,

51:05.363 --> 51:06.829
and I want to help.

51:06.864 --> 51:07.997
That's really thoughtful.

51:10.835 --> 51:13.002
Um, should we just...
We should start.

51:13.037 --> 51:14.970
Let's... That's
what these are for.

51:16.340 --> 51:18.741
Now, don't you forget

51:18.776 --> 51:20.209
to share some of that
with your parents. Hmm?

51:24.515 --> 51:26.749
Oh, I got that, mrs. Huff.

51:26.784 --> 51:29.552
A perfect choice
for this year's collection.

51:29.587 --> 51:30.553
-Thank you.

51:30.588 --> 51:33.389
Are those fresh
candy cane cookies I smell?

51:33.424 --> 51:35.024
Yes! I forgot to take them out.

51:37.361 --> 51:39.695
What in the world...?

51:41.099 --> 51:42.731
Jay.

51:53.711 --> 51:54.510
Oh...

51:54.545 --> 51:56.078
Jay?

51:59.283 --> 52:00.382
Oh!

52:01.586 --> 52:03.586
Hello!

52:03.621 --> 52:06.856
I had some holiday
shopping to do, so...

52:06.891 --> 52:07.990
How can I help?

52:09.760 --> 52:12.194
I don't remember these
from your house growing up.

52:12.230 --> 52:13.462
Are they new?

52:13.498 --> 52:14.396
My mom made them.

52:14.432 --> 52:15.598
Viv did?

52:15.633 --> 52:16.799
-Mm-hmm.
-Wow.

52:16.834 --> 52:18.367
She really is good.

52:18.402 --> 52:19.735
She's a talent.

52:19.770 --> 52:22.571
Both of my parents have been
really supportive

52:22.607 --> 52:24.940
about me serving.

52:27.845 --> 52:29.411
Hey, I need to talk to you
about something.

52:30.815 --> 52:32.381
Way back in senior year...

52:32.416 --> 52:33.649
Oh, we don't have to...

52:33.684 --> 52:37.720
No, no, I... Need to.

52:37.755 --> 52:39.488
All right.

52:39.524 --> 52:40.823
I didn't break it off with you

52:40.858 --> 52:42.291
because of how you enlisted.

52:42.326 --> 52:45.094
I did it because of
what my mom and I went through

52:45.129 --> 52:46.729
losing my dad.

52:46.764 --> 52:49.565
And I should have
said something, but I...

52:49.600 --> 52:50.499
I didn't know how.

52:50.535 --> 52:52.902
I'm really sorry.

52:54.639 --> 52:55.571
You should have known.

52:55.606 --> 52:58.274
I think I did know.

52:58.309 --> 52:59.241
Deep down.

52:59.277 --> 53:00.342
I didn't want you

53:00.378 --> 53:02.912
to have to go through
the same kind of loss again,

53:02.947 --> 53:07.149
and that's why I guess
I just kind of...

53:07.185 --> 53:08.050
Accepted it.

53:11.722 --> 53:14.490
I hope it didn't keep you
from moving on, and...

53:14.525 --> 53:16.825
Oh... Oh, I've dated.

53:18.729 --> 53:22.164
Nobody that's really stuck,

53:22.200 --> 53:26.435
but maybe I just haven't found
the right person...

53:26.470 --> 53:29.271
Who can put up with me.

53:29.307 --> 53:31.774
[she chuckles]

53:31.809 --> 53:33.442
I keep thinking about
your grandad's journal.

53:33.477 --> 53:34.443
Yeah?

53:34.478 --> 53:35.644
I can't help but wondering

53:35.680 --> 53:37.613
whether it was the army
that kept him and martha apart,

53:37.648 --> 53:40.282
but if he had a second chance,

53:40.318 --> 53:41.917
would he still sign up?

53:46.157 --> 53:46.989
Yeah.

53:49.493 --> 53:51.994
I was thinking maybe, uh, later,

53:52.029 --> 53:53.963
I'd come by the shop
around closing?

53:53.998 --> 53:55.965
See if I can get the
candy cane express going?

53:56.000 --> 53:58.968
...In case it needs
more mechanics than batteries.

53:59.003 --> 54:00.336
I think that would be good.

54:09.614 --> 54:10.613
[sighing]

54:10.648 --> 54:13.582
we cleared the whole
display case today, twice.

54:13.618 --> 54:14.483
That's so good!

54:16.354 --> 54:18.754
Now I have to start
unboxing stock for tomorrow.

54:18.789 --> 54:20.589
It never stops.

54:20.625 --> 54:21.991
Why didn't you ask jay?

54:22.026 --> 54:22.891
He said he was stopping by
this morning.

54:22.927 --> 54:25.027
He left for deliveries
before I could.

54:25.062 --> 54:27.763
Hmm.

54:27.798 --> 54:31.100
Uh, edward
stopped by the shop today.

54:31.135 --> 54:33.669
He had some christmas shopping
he wanted to do,

54:33.704 --> 54:36.238
and I may have said yes

54:36.274 --> 54:38.207
to go to the charity auction
with him tonight.

54:38.242 --> 54:39.241
Mom!

54:39.277 --> 54:40.876
I panicked!

54:40.911 --> 54:42.578
See what happens
when you encourage me?

54:42.613 --> 54:43.479
You're adorable.

54:46.784 --> 54:49.785
You know, um,
why don't you go home?

54:49.820 --> 54:50.686
Get ready.

54:50.721 --> 54:52.454
Put on some lipstick.

54:52.490 --> 54:53.389
I'll take care of closing up.

54:53.424 --> 54:55.357
-Really?
-Mm-hmm.

54:55.393 --> 54:56.525
Because I could just...

54:56.560 --> 54:58.527
[doorbells jingling]

55:03.768 --> 55:05.334
-hey.
-Hi.

55:09.774 --> 55:11.540
How's the new niece?

55:11.575 --> 55:13.609
Cutest thing you ever saw.

55:13.644 --> 55:15.711
Show you a picture?

55:15.746 --> 55:17.546
Mm.

55:17.581 --> 55:19.715
-Mm...
-[he chuckles]

55:19.750 --> 55:20.582
beautiful.

55:22.086 --> 55:23.652
Give denise and your parents
my love.

55:23.688 --> 55:25.120
I will.

55:25.156 --> 55:27.523
Merry christmas, logan.

55:30.161 --> 55:32.094
Merry christmas to you too.

55:36.133 --> 55:38.934
[doorbells jingling]

55:42.606 --> 55:45.407
"a few months out on mission,

55:45.443 --> 55:48.911
impatient
to get back to base..."

55:48.946 --> 55:51.513
oh, what's that?

55:51.549 --> 55:53.082
[clara] it's a christmas card.

55:53.117 --> 55:54.483
It must be one of the ones
he never sent.

55:54.518 --> 55:55.784
Do you think

55:55.820 --> 55:57.252
that he sent her
christmas cards

55:57.288 --> 55:58.487
every time, like she asked?

55:58.522 --> 56:03.826
I would, if it was me.

56:03.861 --> 56:05.494
You would.

56:07.698 --> 56:08.630
Here. You read.

56:08.666 --> 56:11.800
"even though my cards
came back unopened,

56:11.836 --> 56:15.671
I can't stop hoping
one might get through,

56:15.706 --> 56:18.474
that we'll have
our great love.

56:18.509 --> 56:21.276
I'll come find you the minute
I finish my service.

56:21.312 --> 56:26.448
'til then, merry christmas,
times infinity.

56:26.484 --> 56:27.983
Love, jerry."

56:29.520 --> 56:31.120
I wonder if that was
the last one he wrote,

56:31.155 --> 56:34.156
and then after this...

56:34.191 --> 56:38.627
He just... Gave up?

56:38.662 --> 56:42.398
It feels so sad.

56:42.433 --> 56:45.634
Or...

56:45.669 --> 56:49.905
Even if jerry and martha
never saw each other again,

56:49.940 --> 56:52.107
maybe she opened up his heart.

56:53.878 --> 56:54.810
If that's what he got

56:54.845 --> 56:57.546
for falling in love
for the first time...

56:57.581 --> 56:59.148
Maybe it's not a sad story.

57:01.285 --> 57:03.886
Maybe that's
what first love does...

57:03.921 --> 57:06.688
It sets the tone
for the rest of your life.

57:11.862 --> 57:14.129
It's getting late.

57:15.966 --> 57:17.666
Yup.

57:42.927 --> 57:45.627
Hey, blake...

57:45.663 --> 57:47.095
Give me a call.

57:47.131 --> 57:49.531
There's something
really important

57:49.567 --> 57:51.500
we need to talk about.

57:56.440 --> 57:59.541
On.

57:59.577 --> 58:02.411
Three years of barbecue
of the month club?

58:02.446 --> 58:03.545
I guess you're going to have

58:03.581 --> 58:05.547
to find
someone to share it with.

58:05.583 --> 58:07.282
We made a pretty good team
on decorations...

58:07.318 --> 58:08.550
Mm-hmm.

58:08.586 --> 58:09.618
Though I have to admit,

58:09.653 --> 58:13.055
I may have hidden the sheet
after we signed up.

58:13.090 --> 58:14.490
Oh, wait.

58:14.525 --> 58:16.458
It was because of you

58:16.494 --> 58:19.394
that we did all that
by ourselves?

58:19.430 --> 58:21.230
I wanted a way
to spend one-on-one time

58:21.265 --> 58:23.532
getting to know you better.

58:29.306 --> 58:30.906
I thought I was ready,

58:30.941 --> 58:32.574
but I'm not yet.

58:32.610 --> 58:37.980
I just have so much
to deal with.

58:38.015 --> 58:39.014
I'm sorry.

58:39.049 --> 58:40.549
Bonnie...

58:44.788 --> 58:47.923
Thanks for
a really great evening.

58:47.958 --> 58:49.892
Really.

58:58.202 --> 58:59.635
[door opening]

59:02.973 --> 59:04.206
[call ringing]

59:04.241 --> 59:05.107
[sighing]

59:05.142 --> 59:08.610
[phone ringing]

59:08.646 --> 59:10.612
<i> -I broke santa.</i>
<i> -</i> Jay?

59:10.648 --> 59:13.115
I broke the santa timer
in the store,

59:13.150 --> 59:15.517
and I couldn't find
any extras in the back,

59:15.553 --> 59:18.287
so I thought maybe you'd know
where replacements are?

59:18.322 --> 59:19.221
I got it.

59:19.256 --> 59:20.656
<i>No problem. I'll see you later.</i>

59:20.691 --> 59:22.124
[sighing] okay, thank you.

59:24.395 --> 59:25.661
Oof!

59:46.050 --> 59:48.717
And they really work, too.

59:48.752 --> 59:49.585
Right behind me, there's a lady

59:49.620 --> 59:52.654
who's selling
these amazing walnuts.

59:52.690 --> 59:53.989
Go grab a bag and see.

59:54.024 --> 59:54.990
Crush crush crush!

59:55.025 --> 59:58.827
[phone ringing]

59:58.862 --> 1:00:01.396
this is logan.

1:00:01.432 --> 1:00:02.364
Yes?

1:00:02.399 --> 1:00:05.367
Yes, sir.

1:00:05.402 --> 1:00:07.035
Yes, I will.

1:00:10.474 --> 1:00:11.306
Thank you, sir.

1:00:21.285 --> 1:00:23.885
[call ringing]

1:00:23.921 --> 1:00:26.355
hey, can you call me
when you have a sec?

1:00:26.390 --> 1:00:29.524
There's something
I want to tell you about.

1:00:29.560 --> 1:00:30.892
Thanks.

1:00:46.010 --> 1:00:47.876
"my dearest martha,

1:00:47.911 --> 1:00:50.078
I couldn't resist writing
one last time.

1:00:50.114 --> 1:00:52.214
If there's one thing
I've learned from these years,

1:00:52.249 --> 1:00:55.050
the days run by,

1:00:55.085 --> 1:00:56.585
the love won't stop,

1:00:56.620 --> 1:00:58.153
the pages keep floating by,

1:00:58.188 --> 1:01:01.657
and sometimes this whole life
leaves you wishing

1:01:01.692 --> 1:01:03.825
we could share
five more minutes."

1:01:03.861 --> 1:01:05.060
huh.

1:01:07.264 --> 1:01:08.930
"so I think we should meet."

1:01:26.850 --> 1:01:27.482
hi.

1:01:27.518 --> 1:01:28.183
Hey, did you get my message?

1:01:28.218 --> 1:01:29.885
Grandpa jerry wrote to martha.

1:01:31.288 --> 1:01:33.088
Recently. Like, this year.

1:01:37.394 --> 1:01:38.260
Tell me everything.

1:01:38.295 --> 1:01:39.995
Uh, can you...?

1:01:44.535 --> 1:01:46.768
He still wanted to connect.

1:01:46.804 --> 1:01:47.803
You think they met up?

1:01:47.838 --> 1:01:50.772
The card wasn't sent.
It wasn't even addressed.

1:01:50.808 --> 1:01:54.476
I don't think he knew
where she lived, but...

1:01:54.511 --> 1:01:55.644
...Some part of him...

1:01:55.679 --> 1:01:57.179
...Still wanted to know
if there was something there.

1:02:01.819 --> 1:02:02.818
Should we give him
that chance?

1:02:02.853 --> 1:02:04.686
What, try and find her?

1:02:06.056 --> 1:02:07.656
Deliver the card.

1:02:07.691 --> 1:02:08.790
If you were martha,

1:02:08.826 --> 1:02:11.660
would you want to know
how your granddad really felt

1:02:11.695 --> 1:02:12.994
after all this time?

1:02:14.932 --> 1:02:18.700
Everyone deserves to know
if they were loved...

1:02:19.837 --> 1:02:21.837
The way my grandpa
loved martha.

1:02:24.575 --> 1:02:26.007
Let's go find martha thompkins.

1:02:36.620 --> 1:02:37.686
This is our place.

1:02:40.224 --> 1:02:43.158
Okay, my search gave me
nine martha thompkins

1:02:43.193 --> 1:02:44.726
in a 10-mile radius
of fayetteville.

1:02:44.762 --> 1:02:46.128
Lucky number one.

1:02:47.131 --> 1:02:47.996
[knocking]

1:02:50.400 --> 1:02:51.600
hi, are you
martha thompkins?

1:02:51.635 --> 1:02:52.567
Yes.

1:02:52.603 --> 1:02:54.503
My name is clara brigham,

1:02:54.538 --> 1:02:55.937
and my grandfather
was jerry brigham.

1:02:55.973 --> 1:02:59.341
I was wondering if you were
the martha thompkins

1:02:59.376 --> 1:03:00.942
who knew him in the '50s.

1:03:00.978 --> 1:03:03.545
I don't remember
any jerry brigham.

1:03:03.580 --> 1:03:05.013
Well, thanks,
and merry christmas to you.

1:03:05.048 --> 1:03:06.348
Merry christmas.

1:03:06.383 --> 1:03:07.215
[clara] thank you.

1:03:07.251 --> 1:03:09.751
One down... Eight to go.

1:03:16.794 --> 1:03:20.262
Jerry brigham?

1:03:20.297 --> 1:03:23.098
No, I don't know anyone
by that name.

1:03:23.133 --> 1:03:23.965
Is he lost?

1:03:24.001 --> 1:03:26.434
No, he passed away
earlier this year.

1:03:26.470 --> 1:03:29.237
We're looking
for someone he knew.

1:03:29.273 --> 1:03:32.974
A different martha thompkins,
I guess.

1:03:33.010 --> 1:03:34.709
There is another
martha thompkins.

1:03:34.745 --> 1:03:35.944
We know, ma'am.

1:03:35.979 --> 1:03:38.246
You're the ninth
we've tried in town.

1:03:38.282 --> 1:03:40.882
I'm thinking of a woman
who lives a few towns over.

1:03:40.918 --> 1:03:43.418
We never met, but I used
to get some of her mail.

1:03:43.453 --> 1:03:46.054
We have the same middle name.

1:03:46.089 --> 1:03:47.756
I kept her new address.
One second.

1:03:49.526 --> 1:03:50.358
It's gotta be her, right?

1:03:59.837 --> 1:04:01.536
I mean, she wouldn't
have gone to all the trouble

1:04:01.572 --> 1:04:02.671
of putting up
these christmas decorations

1:04:02.706 --> 1:04:05.207
if she was going to be
away for the holidays, right?

1:04:05.242 --> 1:04:06.274
No, yeah, absolutely.

1:04:06.310 --> 1:04:07.843
She's going to be around.

1:04:09.646 --> 1:04:11.880
What are you going
to say to her?

1:04:11.915 --> 1:04:12.981
If it's her?

1:04:13.016 --> 1:04:16.551
I guess I would, um...

1:04:16.587 --> 1:04:18.687
Want to find out why
they didn't end up together.

1:04:21.291 --> 1:04:23.525
You just never quite
get over it.

1:04:29.466 --> 1:04:31.933
Oh, that first christmas
after I deployed,

1:04:31.969 --> 1:04:35.737
I wrote maybe 50 versions
of a card to you.

1:04:35.772 --> 1:04:41.243
Regret, and apologies, and...

1:04:41.278 --> 1:04:42.777
My feelings.

1:04:46.550 --> 1:04:48.083
I couldn't send it.

1:04:48.118 --> 1:04:50.986
I couldn't have read it.

1:04:51.021 --> 1:04:53.922
Not then.

1:04:53.957 --> 1:04:57.292
I would have...

1:04:57.327 --> 1:04:58.360
Protected myself.

1:04:58.395 --> 1:05:00.629
That's okay.

1:05:00.664 --> 1:05:05.033
No...No,

1:05:05.068 --> 1:05:10.105
I just realize that that's
what I have been doing...

1:05:10.140 --> 1:05:12.440
Making safe choices.

1:05:12.476 --> 1:05:13.508
Gravitating towards safe people.

1:05:13.543 --> 1:05:15.677
Not believing that
I could teach somewhere else,

1:05:15.712 --> 1:05:17.979
or be the person
that I used to be,

1:05:18.015 --> 1:05:19.347
all the things that you...

1:05:19.383 --> 1:05:21.783
That you've opened my eyes to.

1:05:21.818 --> 1:05:22.951
Come on.

1:05:22.986 --> 1:05:27.923
Yeah, to the person that you
and my grandpa always saw.

1:05:32.596 --> 1:05:34.162
Spend christmas
with me and my mom.

1:05:35.365 --> 1:05:36.464
Please?

1:05:36.500 --> 1:05:39.467
Your family is out of town,
you shouldn't be alone,

1:05:39.503 --> 1:05:42.904
and this week has been...

1:05:42.940 --> 1:05:44.873
Yeah, I... Clara...

1:05:46.510 --> 1:05:49.010
I've been called back
to active duty.

1:05:51.715 --> 1:05:52.614
Oh.

1:05:53.850 --> 1:05:55.383
Yeah.

1:05:55.419 --> 1:05:57.252
When?

1:05:57.287 --> 1:05:58.186
Right after the new year.

1:06:00.857 --> 1:06:02.657
But everything you said...

1:06:02.693 --> 1:06:04.826
No, no, no, no,
it's... It's okay.

1:06:04.861 --> 1:06:05.527
Uh... Um...

1:06:05.562 --> 1:06:07.729
Seriously. It...

1:06:09.032 --> 1:06:10.532
Just, um...

1:06:10.567 --> 1:06:12.534
Can you take me home, please?

1:06:15.973 --> 1:06:16.871
Clara...

1:06:28.952 --> 1:06:29.818
[door closing]

1:06:31.455 --> 1:06:33.188
thanks for the ride back.

1:06:33.223 --> 1:06:34.589
Yeah. Wait. I...

1:06:36.426 --> 1:06:37.559
Do you still want
to spend christmas?

1:06:42.299 --> 1:06:43.198
The time...

1:06:43.233 --> 1:06:46.434
Our timing,

1:06:46.470 --> 1:06:47.569
it never...

1:06:49.406 --> 1:06:50.772
Just please be safe.

1:06:50.807 --> 1:06:51.873
Clara...

1:06:51.908 --> 1:06:53.608
Merry christmas.

1:06:59.316 --> 1:07:01.449
Mom? You here?

1:07:01.485 --> 1:07:04.152
Yeah. In the living room,

1:07:04.187 --> 1:07:05.186
with, um...

1:07:06.590 --> 1:07:07.389
Surprise.

1:07:07.424 --> 1:07:09.791
Um, uh...

1:07:09.826 --> 1:07:11.693
What're... You doing here?

1:07:14.131 --> 1:07:17.565
I have to... Uh, deal
with something upstairs.

1:07:17.601 --> 1:07:20.368
You said
you wanted to talk, so...

1:07:21.838 --> 1:07:23.104
Just, um, please, sit down.

1:07:29.112 --> 1:07:29.911
[exhaling slowly]

1:07:29.946 --> 1:07:30.945
[chuckling]

1:07:32.616 --> 1:07:35.617
I saw the ring box.

1:07:37.387 --> 1:07:38.920
Right.

1:07:38.955 --> 1:07:39.587
So...

1:07:39.623 --> 1:07:44.125
I... Really care about you.

1:07:47.898 --> 1:07:51.599
I think that's what I heard
on the phone,

1:07:51.635 --> 1:07:52.934
when you sounded so distant.

1:07:52.969 --> 1:07:56.638
I can see a life with you.

1:07:56.673 --> 1:07:59.674
Clara, if you're not
jumping for joy

1:07:59.709 --> 1:08:00.675
for me to ask you,

1:08:00.710 --> 1:08:03.845
it's not really
what I'm looking for either.

1:08:06.983 --> 1:08:09.951
Look, I should have said
something at the restaurant,

1:08:09.986 --> 1:08:14.155
and I... But honestly,
I didn't know how I felt,

1:08:14.191 --> 1:08:15.790
and then I didn't want
to say anything

1:08:15.826 --> 1:08:17.492
until I knew, and...

1:08:17.527 --> 1:08:20.361
And now you...
And now you do?

1:08:24.668 --> 1:08:26.568
Look, if everything
happens for a reason,

1:08:26.603 --> 1:08:29.404
then maybe seeing the ring
was a sign.

1:08:29.439 --> 1:08:30.805
I just...

1:08:30.841 --> 1:08:33.208
I'm sorry. I am so sorry.

1:08:33.243 --> 1:08:34.642
I never wanted to hurt you.

1:08:34.678 --> 1:08:37.312
I... But just...

1:08:37.347 --> 1:08:38.813
Why don't you stay the night?

1:08:38.849 --> 1:08:40.148
We have a guest room...

1:08:40.183 --> 1:08:41.850
No, no, no, no, no.
It's okay. It's okay.

1:08:41.885 --> 1:08:43.651
I'm gonna... I'm gonna go.

1:08:43.687 --> 1:08:44.853
I'm gonna head to the airport.

1:08:44.888 --> 1:08:47.522
Um, say goodbye
to your mom for me.

1:08:47.557 --> 1:08:49.390
It was really nice
to meet her, finally.

1:08:51.361 --> 1:08:52.327
And, um...

1:08:52.362 --> 1:08:55.029
Merry christmas, clara.

1:08:55.065 --> 1:08:56.965
Merry christmas.

1:09:02.405 --> 1:09:04.038
[blake] it's all right.

1:09:05.542 --> 1:09:06.975
Okay.

1:09:18.922 --> 1:09:21.055
Mm...

1:09:21.091 --> 1:09:22.390
Thanks, mom.

1:09:22.425 --> 1:09:24.392
-Mm-hmm.

1:09:28.732 --> 1:09:31.099
I ruined everyone's christmas.

1:09:33.236 --> 1:09:36.437
You did the right thing.

1:09:39.576 --> 1:09:42.577
The way you learn
and love with someone

1:09:42.612 --> 1:09:44.946
is how you figure out
how to move forward.

1:09:48.852 --> 1:09:52.220
I, um, found grandpa's journal.

1:09:52.255 --> 1:09:55.256
You left it
on the kitchen table.

1:09:55.292 --> 1:09:58.660
I read it to the very end.

1:09:58.695 --> 1:10:01.229
Was there any more
about martha?

1:10:01.264 --> 1:10:03.831
Mm, much later,

1:10:03.867 --> 1:10:07.802
when grandpa
got back from korea.

1:10:09.940 --> 1:10:12.907
"it was almost two years.

1:10:12.943 --> 1:10:15.076
I was heading home
for christmas...

1:10:17.047 --> 1:10:19.914
...And I was going
to find my love.

1:10:23.520 --> 1:10:28.856
I went to martha's family home,
but it had been sold,

1:10:28.892 --> 1:10:33.595
so I asked around
until I found her new address.

1:10:33.630 --> 1:10:37.832
It was way outside town.

1:10:37.867 --> 1:10:42.503
I walked miles
until I finally found it.

1:10:53.483 --> 1:10:57.619
Martha moved on without me.

1:10:57.654 --> 1:11:01.856
I may never know
if she got my letters,

1:11:01.891 --> 1:11:03.725
or worse...

1:11:03.760 --> 1:11:07.996
If she did,
and it didn't matter."

1:11:11.268 --> 1:11:12.967
martha got married.

1:11:14.437 --> 1:11:16.838
And had a family...

1:11:16.873 --> 1:11:19.474
But so did grandpa,

1:11:19.509 --> 1:11:20.808
with grandma nell,

1:11:20.844 --> 1:11:23.478
and she was wonderful.

1:11:23.513 --> 1:11:25.313
The very best.

1:11:25.348 --> 1:11:28.850
I'm so glad grandpa
had a second chance at love.

1:11:28.885 --> 1:11:30.251
And so will you.

1:11:30.287 --> 1:11:31.653
So will you.

1:11:31.688 --> 1:11:35.123
I guess we
just have to keep on wishing.

1:11:37.861 --> 1:11:39.327
I wish grandpa knew

1:11:39.362 --> 1:11:41.896
everything he gave us.

1:11:47.437 --> 1:11:49.737
Why did we make
so much

1:11:49.773 --> 1:11:51.372
we always make this much food.

1:11:51.408 --> 1:11:53.041
One, it's christmas eve.

1:11:53.076 --> 1:11:53.808
And two...

1:11:53.843 --> 1:11:55.710
[both]
...Leftover sandwiches.

1:11:55.745 --> 1:11:57.612
[laughing]

1:11:59.249 --> 1:12:00.648
[doorbell ringing]

1:12:00.684 --> 1:12:01.349
oh, I'll get it.

1:12:01.384 --> 1:12:03.318
Kelly said she might stop by.

1:12:03.353 --> 1:12:07.388
You better be bringing
something good, because...

1:12:07.424 --> 1:12:08.656
I'm sorry to intrude.

1:12:08.692 --> 1:12:10.158
Are you clara?

1:12:10.193 --> 1:12:12.026
I think you left this
in my mail. I'm...

1:12:12.062 --> 1:12:12.860
You're martha!

1:12:14.764 --> 1:12:15.563
The martha!

1:12:19.135 --> 1:12:21.169
So you never
received the letters?

1:12:21.204 --> 1:12:23.504
My parents returned them
without my knowing.

1:12:23.540 --> 1:12:25.873
My mother didn't tell me
about his letters

1:12:25.909 --> 1:12:27.942
until right before she passed.

1:12:27.977 --> 1:12:30.378
By then, I had married
a wonderful man,

1:12:30.413 --> 1:12:33.848
had three children,
seven beautiful grandchildren,

1:12:33.883 --> 1:12:34.782
and a happy life.

1:12:34.818 --> 1:12:37.685
Your grandfather got married
too, I know.

1:12:37.721 --> 1:12:38.686
Oh, how did you know?

1:12:38.722 --> 1:12:39.554
We spoke.

1:12:41.057 --> 1:12:43.024
You and jerry? When?

1:12:43.059 --> 1:12:43.858
Last year.

1:12:43.893 --> 1:12:44.792
He looked me up.

1:12:44.828 --> 1:12:46.527
But his letter...

1:12:46.563 --> 1:12:50.198
He didn't want another letter
to get lost or returned,

1:12:50.233 --> 1:12:52.200
so he tracked me down,

1:12:52.235 --> 1:12:55.470
and we spoke on the phone
several times.

1:12:55.505 --> 1:12:59.974
We were going to meet
face to face in June.

1:13:00.009 --> 1:13:02.543
I know. I saw it in the paper.

1:13:03.980 --> 1:13:05.546
I made my peace with it,

1:13:05.582 --> 1:13:09.784
though I can't help but wonder
what it would've been like

1:13:09.819 --> 1:13:11.052
to see each other again,

1:13:11.087 --> 1:13:12.887
even for five more minutes.

1:13:15.425 --> 1:13:18.793
He loved you both so much.

1:13:18.828 --> 1:13:20.995
He told me on the phone

1:13:21.030 --> 1:13:22.730
how happy you made him.

1:13:22.766 --> 1:13:24.899
What a life he had.

1:13:24.934 --> 1:13:26.234
I have too.

1:13:26.269 --> 1:13:27.902
And I credit jerry.

1:13:27.937 --> 1:13:30.104
But if he broke your heart...?

1:13:30.140 --> 1:13:34.642
Once someone
opens your heart,

1:13:34.677 --> 1:13:37.011
you believe
you're worthy of love.

1:13:37.046 --> 1:13:40.248
Without jerry,

1:13:40.283 --> 1:13:42.784
I would never have
the rest of my life.

1:13:44.354 --> 1:13:47.722
And he would
never have found nell.

1:13:50.360 --> 1:13:51.192
Thank you for inviting me in.

1:13:51.227 --> 1:13:53.828
I'll let you get back
to your holiday.

1:13:53.863 --> 1:13:55.363
Ooh... I almost forgot.

1:13:55.398 --> 1:13:59.033
In the envelope are a few
photos I have from then

1:13:59.068 --> 1:14:00.001
of jerry and me.

1:14:00.036 --> 1:14:01.436
Oh...

1:14:01.471 --> 1:14:03.004
I thought you might enjoy them.

1:14:03.039 --> 1:14:03.704
Oh, yes.

1:14:03.740 --> 1:14:06.307
It was a pleasure to meet you.

1:14:06.342 --> 1:14:08.309
-And you, martha.
-You too.

1:14:11.347 --> 1:14:13.648
[alert ringing]

1:14:16.986 --> 1:14:19.520
uh, the motion detector
went off at the shop.

1:14:19.556 --> 1:14:21.122
There's nothing
on the camera,

1:14:21.157 --> 1:14:22.623
but I should go check it out.

1:14:22.659 --> 1:14:23.724
No, I got it.

1:14:23.760 --> 1:14:26.127
I'll be back before
the turkey is rested and carved.

1:14:26.162 --> 1:14:26.994
-Okay.

1:14:33.002 --> 1:14:33.968
Jay?

1:14:34.003 --> 1:14:35.736
What're you doing here?

1:14:35.772 --> 1:14:37.472
I noticed some of these bulbs
were out the other day,

1:14:37.507 --> 1:14:39.340
and I kept forgetting
to replace them.

1:14:39.375 --> 1:14:41.542
I figured I'd take care of them.

1:14:41.578 --> 1:14:43.377
Well, the motion sensors
went off at the store,

1:14:43.413 --> 1:14:44.412
so I came to check it out.

1:14:44.447 --> 1:14:46.647
Oh, oh no! I didn't mean
to set the sensors off.

1:14:46.683 --> 1:14:47.515
I'm sorry.

1:14:47.550 --> 1:14:49.484
Did I take you away
from something?

1:14:49.519 --> 1:14:52.854
It's been a really big night.

1:14:54.457 --> 1:14:56.824
Don't you have family
to celebrate with?

1:14:58.361 --> 1:15:00.728
Oh, yes,
I'm meeting them later.

1:15:04.267 --> 1:15:07.435
Hey...

1:15:07.470 --> 1:15:09.237
You wanna come in
for a candy cane?

1:15:09.272 --> 1:15:10.872
I would love to.

1:15:12.709 --> 1:15:13.641
Thank you.

1:15:19.883 --> 1:15:22.383
Candy canes were always
my grandpa's favorite.

1:15:23.920 --> 1:15:26.521
Because they're so sweet?

1:15:26.556 --> 1:15:29.056
Because they last a long time,

1:15:29.092 --> 1:15:34.228
and you can think your questions
all the way through...

1:15:34.264 --> 1:15:40.101
And by the time
you get to the curly end,

1:15:40.136 --> 1:15:41.068
you had your answer.

1:15:44.073 --> 1:15:45.072
And what's your question now?

1:15:46.776 --> 1:15:48.743
Do you think everyone
gets a big first love?

1:15:52.248 --> 1:15:53.414
-I did.
-Did it work out?

1:15:54.250 --> 1:15:55.850
No.

1:15:58.922 --> 1:16:02.557
It taught me that I have
that kind of love to give,

1:16:02.592 --> 1:16:04.926
and taking a big risk
with someone you love

1:16:04.961 --> 1:16:06.427
is better than risking life
without them.

1:16:10.767 --> 1:16:15.970
An old friend of my grandpa's
came to the house tonight.

1:16:16.005 --> 1:16:17.071
She said the same thing.

1:16:19.008 --> 1:16:20.141
She did?

1:16:20.176 --> 1:16:22.043
-Mm.

1:16:24.113 --> 1:16:26.147
What did she say?

1:16:26.182 --> 1:16:32.987
She said that
he opened her heart,

1:16:33.022 --> 1:16:36.123
which opened her up
to the rest of her life.

1:16:36.159 --> 1:16:38.426
So much love
flowed between them

1:16:38.461 --> 1:16:42.163
in such a short amount of...

1:16:42.198 --> 1:16:43.965
Are you okay?

1:16:46.803 --> 1:16:48.603
I'm just a sucker
for a good love story.

1:16:50.406 --> 1:16:52.239
[chuckling]

1:16:57.847 --> 1:17:02.817
I wish he could have
seen her just one last time.

1:17:02.852 --> 1:17:07.855
I wish we all could have
those last moments back.

1:17:07.890 --> 1:17:10.491
What would you
have done differently?

1:17:13.129 --> 1:17:15.363
I'd tell him how much
his love meant to me,

1:17:15.398 --> 1:17:18.065
and that I'm...

1:17:18.101 --> 1:17:19.700
I'm the person that I am

1:17:19.736 --> 1:17:23.838
because of his strength
and humor.

1:17:28.144 --> 1:17:29.410
That I'm the teacher I am

1:17:29.445 --> 1:17:32.546
because of
what he taught me...

1:17:34.617 --> 1:17:36.550
And that I'm gonna be okay.

1:17:37.987 --> 1:17:41.856
I just wish
he could hear all that.

1:17:44.427 --> 1:17:45.860
I wish he knew.

1:17:50.333 --> 1:17:52.366
[chuckling]

1:17:52.402 --> 1:17:53.934
he does.

1:17:56.072 --> 1:17:58.005
He knows it now.

1:18:02.478 --> 1:18:04.378

this last week, clara.

Are you going somewhere?

It's christmas eve.

1:18:22.098 --> 1:18:26.967

1:21:29.552 --> 1:21:32.586
and that every second
is a chance

1:21:32.622 --> 1:21:33.921
to hold the people
that you love close

1:21:33.956 --> 1:21:36.090
and tell them how you feel...

1:21:36.125 --> 1:21:39.126
And that taking a risk
with someone you love

1:21:39.161 --> 1:21:41.862
is better than
risking life without them...

1:21:41.898 --> 1:21:44.431
So wherever you go,

1:21:44.467 --> 1:21:46.100
I will go.

1:21:47.503 --> 1:21:48.769
