WEBVTT

00:02.144 --> 00:04.856
The body had feet, all right,
and the feet had sneakers.

00:04.880 --> 00:06.776
- Body have no feet.
- We both saw 'em.

00:06.800 --> 00:10.168
- Some people learn the hard way.
- You are no man right now.

00:12.616 --> 00:14.280
How did you get in here?

00:14.384 --> 00:16.408
Where is Ivan?!

00:17.488 --> 00:19.240
Get out of here. Don't come back!

00:19.328 --> 00:20.656
No, look out, look out!

00:23.960 --> 00:26.712
This gate is the only thing standing
between me and jail.

00:26.736 --> 00:30.120
Uh, how do you know that?
We haven't found the church yet.

00:36.300 --> 00:38.520
I think I'm falling in love.

00:38.680 --> 00:39.920
With who?

00:40.670 --> 00:42.770
- Florida.
- Florida?

00:43.150 --> 00:46.984
If you had a good idea,
it would die of loneliness.

00:47.610 --> 00:49.071
I guess you're gonna tell me

00:49.072 --> 00:52.350
Florida is young, smart,
and smokin',

00:52.420 --> 00:54.960
and I'm old, dumb,
and don't have a real job,

00:55.000 --> 00:56.936
and a woman like Florida can
never fall in love

00:56.960 --> 00:58.472
with a loser like me.

00:59.664 --> 01:01.152
Look down.

01:01.528 --> 01:03.290
See all those fools down there?

01:03.528 --> 01:06.520
You and me, we ain't nothin'
like them, Hap.

01:08.200 --> 01:09.720
I love you, man.

01:09.744 --> 01:11.128
Love you, too, Hap.

01:15.680 --> 01:17.072
Collins.

01:18.392 --> 01:20.656
Your turn on the dance floor.

01:23.344 --> 01:25.768
Wake up, asshole.

01:26.168 --> 01:27.448
Get dressed.

01:34.490 --> 01:35.790
You're lucky.

01:35.806 --> 01:39.546
We got Mr. Bobby Joe Soothe
in here; serenade you.

01:40.856 --> 01:42.600
Thought they had rules

01:43.300 --> 01:46.504
about inmates having shit
they could hang themselves with.

01:46.520 --> 01:49.488
Ah, my Bobby Joe wouldn't
do that.

01:49.512 --> 01:51.440
Turn around.

02:03.928 --> 02:06.928
What the hell they got you
in here for now?

02:08.344 --> 02:09.592
Arson.

02:12.248 --> 02:13.728
You?

02:14.470 --> 02:16.000
Kidnappin'.

02:19.440 --> 02:20.770
Who?

02:21.088 --> 02:22.520
Beau Otis.

02:27.264 --> 02:29.864
You know that Beau Otis is
an epileptic?

02:31.240 --> 02:32.648
Didn't know.

02:33.080 --> 02:34.990
Don't care.

03:22.000 --> 03:23.800
There are only two types
of people

03:23.870 --> 03:26.000
still livin' in this town,
Collins...

03:26.632 --> 03:28.568
them that just couldn't get out

03:30.056 --> 03:31.840
and them that just wouldn't.

03:33.392 --> 03:35.392
Which type are you?

03:37.420 --> 03:39.280
See, here in East Texas,

03:39.712 --> 03:41.520
man needs a plan.

03:43.416 --> 03:45.656
Otherwise, there's just
nothing here for him

03:45.680 --> 03:47.240
except for trouble, of course.

03:49.330 --> 03:51.530
Are you a troublemaker, Collins?

03:54.912 --> 03:56.728
Depends on who you ask.

03:57.328 --> 03:59.140
I'm asking you.

04:00.368 --> 04:01.864
Yeah, I guess I am.

04:05.840 --> 04:07.704
My son Beau is a slothful,

04:07.720 --> 04:10.920
lazy, ignorant son of a bitch,

04:10.984 --> 04:13.592
but he is gonna be
my next county judge,

04:14.392 --> 04:16.664
because that's what
I need him to be,

04:16.704 --> 04:18.672
and you will not prevent that

04:19.632 --> 04:21.672
because I will not allow it.

04:23.000 --> 04:25.232
Although I gotta say,
I would have enjoyed seeing him

04:25.256 --> 04:27.530
piss himself last night.

04:27.864 --> 04:30.488
It wasn't as much fun as
you might imagine.

04:34.312 --> 04:37.224
This is all about what happened
to your daddy, isn't it?

04:41.010 --> 04:44.320
Son, lookin' backwards ain't
gonna get you outta this office,

04:44.856 --> 04:47.832
and it ain't gonna help
your friend Leonard Pine either.

04:49.016 --> 04:52.112
Now that boy is facin'
some serious charges.

04:52.328 --> 04:54.560
Accessory to murder, arson.

04:55.664 --> 04:57.152
I wouldn't worry about him.

04:57.248 --> 04:59.200
He got himself
a pretty good lawyer.

04:59.232 --> 05:00.552
Hey, hey.

05:01.560 --> 05:03.352
Where is she then, I wonder?

05:04.576 --> 05:05.840
She'll be here.

05:05.910 --> 05:07.240
Okay.

05:09.064 --> 05:11.784
In the meantime, here's what
you gotta do for me.

05:13.288 --> 05:16.050
You're gonna promise
to leave my son alone,

05:16.320 --> 05:18.816
and you're gonna stay off
my radar,

05:19.624 --> 05:22.552
and I'm gonna forget about
what happened last night.

05:24.570 --> 05:26.144
Why don't you just go
back out there

05:26.168 --> 05:28.152
and wait for your lawyer
to get here?

05:29.120 --> 05:30.728
If she gets here.

05:35.368 --> 05:37.024
What about Leonard?

05:37.648 --> 05:40.032
Oh, hell, you can
take Leonard with you.

05:41.072 --> 05:42.864
Would you tell Leonard for me,

05:43.728 --> 05:47.144
if he so much as whistles
one false note...

05:49.416 --> 05:51.816
I'm gonna drop him into a hole

05:53.272 --> 05:55.184
that's blacker than he is.

06:14.256 --> 06:15.560
According to the arson report,

06:15.584 --> 06:17.112
the house is a total loss.

06:17.216 --> 06:20.368
Niggers were drug dealers.
I don't know if I'd call it a total loss.

06:20.950 --> 06:22.808
You're lucky nobody was
in there, boy.

06:23.376 --> 06:25.232
You'd be lookin'
at some heavy numbers.

06:25.312 --> 06:27.792
I ain't no murderer,
and I ain't your boy.

06:27.896 --> 06:29.584
But you admit to setting
the fire.

06:30.056 --> 06:32.048
Don't know nothin'
about no fire.

06:36.164 --> 06:38.338
You tell the rest of
the neighborhood to say that, too?

06:39.128 --> 06:40.496
Didn't have to.

06:48.680 --> 06:50.264
You know what I think, Leonard?

06:52.368 --> 06:55.392
I think some people are stupid,
some people are lucky,

06:56.104 --> 06:57.336
but you ain't either.

06:58.432 --> 06:59.920
You just a criminal.

07:01.408 --> 07:03.584
Got yourself a fancy lawyer,
but...

07:04.416 --> 07:06.016
we gon' get you.

07:06.856 --> 07:08.248
Not on this, not on helping

07:08.960 --> 07:11.730
your Uncle Chester
hide that kid's body.

07:12.280 --> 07:13.592
On somethin'.

07:14.470 --> 07:16.030
Just a matter of time.

07:20.416 --> 07:22.096
What, you think,
'cause, uh, we both brothers,

07:22.104 --> 07:23.744
I'm supposed to cut you
some slack?

07:24.952 --> 07:26.312
That what you think?

07:29.528 --> 07:31.448
You wanna know what I think?

07:33.992 --> 07:36.960
I think you stole them shoes
off that dead kid...

07:37.296 --> 07:39.816
a dead kid you know
I ain't kill.

07:43.288 --> 07:45.240
And we ain't no brothers,

07:46.032 --> 07:48.392
slack or no slack.

07:49.880 --> 07:51.328
Now, uh...

07:51.770 --> 07:53.810
if you ain't gon' charge me,

07:53.928 --> 07:55.688
I'm gonna, you know...

07:56.616 --> 07:58.967
Got a Gene Autry movie
comin' on in two hours.

07:58.976 --> 08:01.096
I didn't set my Betamax yet.

08:10.480 --> 08:11.432
Go.

08:24.400 --> 08:26.047
You still lookin'
at my Uncle Chester

08:26.048 --> 08:27.384
like a murderer?

08:27.784 --> 08:29.432
You heard the man, Pine.

08:29.448 --> 08:31.740
You find out who them bones
belong to yet?

08:31.752 --> 08:33.610
Them bones ain't
your problem no more.

08:33.943 --> 08:35.272
Now go on.

08:37.032 --> 08:39.192
And you call me a criminal.

08:53.670 --> 08:54.616
Hey.

08:55.320 --> 08:57.440
It's the luckiest man
in LaBorde.

08:58.648 --> 09:01.440
That makes you
the second luckiest, then.

09:05.016 --> 09:08.064
Don't make sense.
Why they just let us go?

09:09.104 --> 09:10.984
'Cause he's in charge,
and nothing's changed.

09:10.992 --> 09:12.992
That's the way it is
and always will be.

09:15.304 --> 09:18.424
Yeah, well, Melton's gone.

09:18.520 --> 09:20.960
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

09:21.464 --> 09:22.616
Guess I'm wrong.

09:22.624 --> 09:24.464
Maybe some things do change.

09:25.480 --> 09:27.370
So what about
Uncle Chester, huh?

09:27.552 --> 09:30.070
What about BB?
All them other missing kids?

09:30.200 --> 09:33.360
Oh, it's over.
It's over. We... We're done.

09:34.940 --> 09:36.640
So that's it, huh?

09:36.710 --> 09:38.840
Yep. That's it.

09:39.568 --> 09:41.980
Well, I gotta get to work.

09:44.150 --> 09:46.680
I'm-a go and, uh, check on Ivan.

09:47.440 --> 09:48.890
See you around, partner.

09:49.096 --> 09:50.832
Adios, amigo.

09:54.784 --> 09:56.112
Hey, uh, Hap?

09:57.456 --> 09:59.500
We did the right thing, right?

10:00.592 --> 10:01.800
We tried.

10:24.520 --> 10:26.456
- Thank you, Miriam.
- Mm-hmm.

10:26.472 --> 10:28.040
Lord knows, I need it.

10:28.080 --> 10:31.240
I can tell.
You smell tired, Miss Florida.

10:31.760 --> 10:33.632
Mm. What does tired
smell like?

10:33.640 --> 10:37.072
An old white man...
sad and salty.

10:39.536 --> 10:41.240
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

10:42.248 --> 10:43.472
Thank you.

10:49.640 --> 10:50.800
You mind if I...

10:57.736 --> 11:01.040
Um, I'm a little confused.

11:01.920 --> 11:06.328
Two of your clients got
arrested, and you didn't show.

11:06.336 --> 11:08.624
I can't help people
who don't want my help.

11:13.360 --> 11:15.240
Oh, this is about last night.

11:17.768 --> 11:19.936
Yeah, I guess
you can't represent

11:19.950 --> 11:23.368
someone you're having a...
thing with.

11:23.392 --> 11:25.680
One of my clients
burned down a house.

11:25.904 --> 11:28.392
The other one assaulted
a county judge.

11:28.536 --> 11:30.008
Neither one of them
seems capable

11:30.024 --> 11:31.440
of being entirely truthful
with me.

11:31.464 --> 11:32.920
And by the way,
this has nothing to do

11:32.936 --> 11:34.648
with what happened
between you and me.

11:34.776 --> 11:36.208
Well...

11:38.600 --> 11:39.880
I had a nice time.

11:39.912 --> 11:42.792
Everything I do
is under a microscope.

11:44.144 --> 11:46.464
People expect me to be perfect.

11:48.064 --> 11:49.496
Do you understand that?

11:49.760 --> 11:52.424
Yeah, I understand that
you're having difficulties,

11:52.456 --> 11:54.320
- but from where I'm sitting...
- Hap.

11:54.720 --> 11:57.392
Difficult is getting
a teenager into rehab

11:57.400 --> 12:00.576
after he's been busted for
selling food stamps for drugs...

12:00.592 --> 12:03.048
- Yes.
- or reuniting an illegal immigrant with...

12:03.060 --> 12:04.712
with her baby after
she's been deported.

12:04.736 --> 12:06.544
Yeah. Yeah.

12:06.880 --> 12:08.704
What happened between us

12:09.496 --> 12:11.965
is the least difficult thing
I've done in a long time.

12:18.900 --> 12:21.048
- No, let me get that.
- Hap.

12:21.072 --> 12:23.640
No, no, please, give me a...

12:23.960 --> 12:25.672
a little dignity, huh?

12:40.560 --> 12:41.608
Hey.

12:44.056 --> 12:46.336
We were up there pretty high
last night.

12:46.968 --> 12:48.408
How'd you get down?

12:52.376 --> 12:53.912
Thanks for breakfast, Hap.

13:57.650 --> 13:59.820
Boy, look at you.

13:59.836 --> 14:01.794
You best not be causing MeMaw
no trouble.

14:01.893 --> 14:03.251
I ain't.

14:03.964 --> 14:06.151
I wanna get a picture
of you two.

14:08.364 --> 14:12.542
I'm gonna put you two boys
on my wall of remembrance.

14:13.075 --> 14:15.333
You might try smilin'.

14:22.580 --> 14:25.180
A boy and his uncle.

14:26.480 --> 14:29.528
Yeah, speakin' of family, you know
we got to go find yours.

14:29.626 --> 14:32.453
- I don't want to.
- Ain't about what you want, Ivan.

14:32.480 --> 14:33.911
It's about what's right.

14:34.924 --> 14:36.364
Come here, chil'.

14:40.204 --> 14:42.770
My favorite part of the picture.

14:42.800 --> 14:45.300
Leonard, you come look
at this, too.

14:49.084 --> 14:51.946
You can see a lot
if you know how to look.

14:54.222 --> 14:56.088
It's just chemicals, MeMaw.

14:56.115 --> 14:58.035
They're not chemicals.

14:58.050 --> 15:01.831
It's you. It's your spirit
coming through.

15:02.088 --> 15:04.328
All the things you are,

15:04.417 --> 15:06.800
all the things you will be,

15:07.928 --> 15:10.577
and all the people that
come before.

15:11.860 --> 15:14.200
Now, go get dressed.

15:14.266 --> 15:15.964
I made a pie.

15:17.848 --> 15:21.240
I find out who his folks is,
if he got any.

15:21.300 --> 15:24.610
Oh, he got 'em,
whether he want 'em or not.

15:25.262 --> 15:27.155
He just like you.

15:28.151 --> 15:31.493
Trouble in one pocket,
sadness in the other.

15:32.133 --> 15:35.250
But you grown into a fine man.

15:37.013 --> 15:38.444
Now...

15:38.850 --> 15:41.573
go put that pretty picture
on my wall.

15:41.795 --> 15:43.493
Yes, ma'am.

16:06.533 --> 16:09.608
Hap, we a coupla
dumb-ass peckerheads.

16:13.200 --> 16:15.208
That's you in
the picture there, MeMaw?

16:17.840 --> 16:22.853
I was just a little sliver
of a thing there, wasn't I?

16:23.226 --> 16:25.733
The day after the picture
was taken...

16:28.270 --> 16:32.933
the Klan came
and burn up my childhood.

16:39.963 --> 16:41.970
That's where you got
them there scars?

16:44.720 --> 16:46.821
Well, I tried
to put out the fire.

16:49.250 --> 16:51.265
Oh, Lord, I tried.

16:51.280 --> 16:54.094
I tried, I tried, I tried.

16:58.705 --> 17:01.432
All this remembrances...

17:02.829 --> 17:05.470
...clamped a cold hand
on my heart.

17:05.540 --> 17:09.906
Ivan, get me a glass of water,
would you, please?

17:14.246 --> 17:15.240
MeMaw.

17:16.726 --> 17:17.665
MeMaw?

17:18.359 --> 17:20.119
Tell me where this place is.

17:21.992 --> 17:24.060
That place long...

17:25.490 --> 17:26.890
f-forgotten.

17:32.446 --> 17:33.813
With spirits...

17:36.486 --> 17:38.166
no one remembers.

17:45.800 --> 17:48.326
All those little chil'ren...

17:57.693 --> 17:59.266
All lost.

18:15.553 --> 18:17.780
What the hell we doing in here, buddy?

18:17.846 --> 18:19.866
I thought you folks were
scared of places like this.

18:19.886 --> 18:21.493
Doing our job, Charlie.

18:21.513 --> 18:23.053
Yeah, well, Valentine said
we're done with that.

18:23.073 --> 18:24.993
Why you wanna complicate things?

18:28.118 --> 18:29.804
Why'd you become a cop, Charlie?

18:29.820 --> 18:31.166
Oh my God.

18:31.613 --> 18:33.060
Look, you wanna talk
about feelings,

18:33.086 --> 18:34.853
we're gonna do it over doughnuts
like we're supposed to.

18:34.873 --> 18:36.366
We can't get caught in here.

18:36.400 --> 18:37.420
Yeah?

18:38.080 --> 18:39.413
We're cops, right?

18:40.206 --> 18:41.240
Yeah.

18:41.300 --> 18:42.940
So we can do whatever
we wanna do.

18:43.120 --> 18:45.226
Who's gonna question us?
Who's gonna stop us?

18:45.251 --> 18:46.484
Tampering with evidence
is a crime,

18:46.500 --> 18:48.413
and that is what you're doin'
right now.

18:48.453 --> 18:50.646
Tampering's already been done.
It wasn't me.

18:50.766 --> 18:51.880
Don't you wonder why?

18:52.713 --> 18:54.946
I mean, what's so important
about this kid? Who was he?

18:55.100 --> 18:57.026
Nobody. I don't know.
Who cares?

18:57.350 --> 19:00.420
Yeah?
Well, Leonard Pine does.

19:00.490 --> 19:02.720
Yeah, well, Leonard Pine is
a asshole.

19:03.260 --> 19:05.690
He's a criminal,
and he's in your head, man.

20:21.670 --> 20:23.910
- Let me know when it's done.
- Yes, sir.

20:36.080 --> 20:37.546
204 is ready.

20:38.190 --> 20:40.253
Right. The crematorium.

20:53.626 --> 20:55.293
What the hell we just see?

20:57.253 --> 20:58.740
Partner, we were never here.

20:59.510 --> 21:01.920
You gonna forget what
you just saw. We both are.

21:02.260 --> 21:03.273
Understand?

21:21.633 --> 21:23.567
You sure you wanna scrap that?

21:23.940 --> 21:25.040
Why? You want it?

21:25.550 --> 21:26.990
My second cousin, Ferdinand,

21:27.213 --> 21:29.453
- got this auction house over in Dallas.
- Uh-huh?

21:29.473 --> 21:33.130
He is always sellin' that kind
of stuff to these arty farts.

21:33.226 --> 21:34.466
I could check with him.

21:34.513 --> 21:36.166
Why? How much you think
it's worth?

21:36.430 --> 21:38.826
Depends on where it's been,

21:38.860 --> 21:41.106
who made it,
how many of 'em there are.

21:41.500 --> 21:42.824
But I tell you what.

21:42.840 --> 21:45.500
It might be able to pay
for a coat or two of paint

21:45.520 --> 21:46.986
on that old truck of yours.

21:47.256 --> 21:49.783
Oh. Oh, thanks, Fernie.
I'll...

21:50.453 --> 21:51.726
I'll think about it.

21:51.773 --> 21:52.980
Well, let me know.

22:03.413 --> 22:05.080
Oh, Leonard.

22:06.890 --> 22:11.369
We are a coupla
dumb-ass peckerheads.

22:32.653 --> 22:34.290
Murder him, Alfonzo!

22:34.350 --> 22:35.822
Make him bleed!

22:37.392 --> 22:40.314
Excuse me, ladies.
I'm sorry to bother you. Um...

22:40.330 --> 22:41.790
You lost?

22:42.990 --> 22:45.632
No. No, ma'am.
I... I'm not lost. I'm...

22:46.138 --> 22:49.530
You see, I-I'm trying to
find out where this gate was.

22:50.302 --> 22:52.754
See, th-the design here
is real similar

22:52.770 --> 22:56.310
to the stained glass window
design up there on that church,

22:56.380 --> 22:59.052
so I thought it might've
come from here.

22:59.068 --> 23:01.209
Right hook!
Right hook, boy!

23:01.512 --> 23:02.796
Hallelujah!

23:03.627 --> 23:06.720
You think the... this church
ever had a-a fence around it?

23:06.936 --> 23:08.136
Not that I recall.

23:08.152 --> 23:10.122
So you never seen
this gate before?

23:10.707 --> 23:12.158
You pay for that seat?

23:12.692 --> 23:15.987
Well... hello, Miss Grange.

23:17.602 --> 23:20.002
I thought we had
an understanding, you and me.

23:20.554 --> 23:22.184
No, I'm just a private citizen

23:22.200 --> 23:25.312
with a passing interest
in the art of boxing.

23:25.372 --> 23:28.232
Yeah, okay.
Well, this is a fundraiser,

23:28.248 --> 23:30.092
so you wanna stay for the show,

23:30.108 --> 23:31.459
you're gonna have to pay
for a ticket.

23:31.732 --> 23:33.132
Duck, Alfonzo!

23:35.951 --> 23:37.370
Mama's gettin' a
brand-new pair of shoes!

23:38.333 --> 23:39.672
- Collins.
- Yeah?

23:39.742 --> 23:40.797
You box?

23:41.012 --> 23:42.859
Well... little bit.

23:43.282 --> 23:45.382
How 'bout a round or two
for charity,

23:45.398 --> 23:46.768
show these folks how men do it?

23:46.882 --> 23:48.382
- Yeah!
- Please don't.

23:48.452 --> 23:50.036
You think I'm gon'
embarrass you, counselor?

23:50.052 --> 23:51.646
I think you're gonna
embarrass yourself.

23:51.662 --> 23:53.263
Oh. So you do care.

23:53.392 --> 23:54.549
I really don't.

24:10.224 --> 24:11.780
Pretty light on yo' feet.

24:18.417 --> 24:20.023
Didn't hurt too much, did it?

24:20.239 --> 24:22.369
- Barely felt it.
- Is that right?

24:29.019 --> 24:30.310
Hey, just sparring, right?

24:30.326 --> 24:32.340
Nothin' heavy, just a spar.

24:38.207 --> 24:39.707
- Oh, hey.
- Uhh!

24:40.042 --> 24:41.731
That's all you got? Huh?

25:05.162 --> 25:07.051
You beat up my pastor.

25:17.787 --> 25:19.692
Oh, shit.

25:34.216 --> 25:35.810
_

25:37.707 --> 25:39.677
<i>Boy's smart.</i>

25:43.507 --> 25:45.447
Old Cottonmouth Road.

25:45.626 --> 25:47.528
<i>Now don't be tellin'
them cops nothin'.</i>

25:47.747 --> 25:49.468
<i>Popo dumb as dirt,</i>

25:49.777 --> 25:51.687
<i>and just as ugly, too.</i>

25:52.912 --> 25:54.633
<i>Do it yourself, boy.</i>

25:55.413 --> 25:56.813
<i>I would.</i>

26:12.649 --> 26:14.368
You almost had me there.

26:18.620 --> 26:20.030
Don't care what he says.

26:20.207 --> 26:22.161
You opened up a can of whup-ass
on that man.

26:22.177 --> 26:24.501
I appreciate that, ma'am.

26:27.365 --> 26:29.054
Hold on now.
You need to sit a while.

26:29.070 --> 26:31.140
- You still got the vapors still.
- Mm-hmm.

26:35.450 --> 26:39.255
Will you tell me,
any of you ladies know where...

26:39.950 --> 26:42.460
where the Old Hope Church is?

26:48.810 --> 26:50.194
Much obliged.

26:53.027 --> 26:55.527
Goddamn peckerheads
all think alike.

26:55.810 --> 26:57.916
I thought it was great minds.

26:58.381 --> 27:00.151
In your case, peckerheads.

27:02.567 --> 27:03.837
Wall look like a...

27:03.897 --> 27:05.766
smile missing a tooth.

27:07.532 --> 27:09.873
I think the killer took
that gate

27:10.677 --> 27:13.113
so he had something
to weigh him down with.

27:14.507 --> 27:16.982
How far you think
Illium's pond is?

27:19.216 --> 27:20.716
Half a mile east.

27:20.887 --> 27:21.836
Mm-hmm.

27:23.376 --> 27:25.536
What the hell was that kid
doing out here,

27:25.552 --> 27:27.192
playing all by himself?

28:03.201 --> 28:04.811
The old church.

28:04.871 --> 28:05.962
Yep.

28:07.451 --> 28:08.820
Old MeMaw was right.

28:10.021 --> 28:11.905
This place should be forgotten.

28:27.561 --> 28:29.601
Ohh, I am old.

28:29.661 --> 28:32.071
I think I just squashed
my last kidney.

28:32.419 --> 28:35.870
I am so damn old!

28:49.311 --> 28:50.921
Looks like the basement.

28:51.342 --> 28:53.451
It damn sure ain't the attic,
Einstein.

28:56.810 --> 28:58.183
Through here.

29:11.834 --> 29:13.718
These boards look brand-new.

29:16.841 --> 29:18.211
Let's check it out, huh?

29:18.281 --> 29:20.181
- Oh, Hap, I'm outta here.
- Hey, come on, man.

29:20.251 --> 29:21.721
Come on, give me a hand.

29:25.351 --> 29:26.951
Would you...
Come on, give me a hand.

29:31.154 --> 29:33.031
Get it.

30:00.496 --> 30:01.726
There you go.

30:05.214 --> 30:07.171
What is all this?

30:09.591 --> 30:11.591
1977.

30:13.071 --> 30:14.179
'78.

30:14.760 --> 30:15.969
'79.

30:16.781 --> 30:17.973
'80.

30:22.180 --> 30:24.451
Hey, help me with this one.

30:25.188 --> 30:26.851
- Is it loose?
- Yeah.

30:29.181 --> 30:31.081
Oh shit!

30:33.331 --> 30:34.807
Ah, Jesus.

30:35.751 --> 30:38.091
Jesus ain't had nothin' to do
with this, Hap.

30:38.942 --> 30:40.285
Just a kid.

30:58.963 --> 31:01.484
Real sorry what happened to you, boy.

31:03.294 --> 31:04.994
Real sorry.

31:15.000 --> 31:16.935
There's a box for every year.

31:20.701 --> 31:22.501
And this is '88.

31:28.841 --> 31:30.211
Empty.

31:35.211 --> 31:36.452
Whoever did this...

31:39.391 --> 31:40.891
...ain't finished yet.

31:41.377 --> 31:43.439
Whoever did this killed BB.

31:46.527 --> 31:48.588
Chester was right.
It's all connected.

31:52.383 --> 31:54.102
Oh, shit, Hap. We can't even
go to the cops.

31:54.118 --> 31:56.082
Our prints all over
this damn place.

31:59.832 --> 32:01.594
Valentine did warn me.

32:03.450 --> 32:04.957
Warn you about what?

32:06.298 --> 32:07.613
This morning.

32:09.072 --> 32:10.801
He said if we don't drop it...

32:13.438 --> 32:16.238
he'd drop you into a hole
darker'n this one.

32:18.438 --> 32:21.718
I don't give a damn
what happen to me no more.

32:22.384 --> 32:25.583
And I don't give a damn
what you promised Valentine.

32:30.786 --> 32:32.585
We gon' find out who did this.

32:34.039 --> 32:36.306
He's gonna end up killin' more.

32:49.301 --> 32:51.754
We got 22 missing kids

32:52.129 --> 32:53.730
and 13 bodies.

32:55.210 --> 32:56.785
Now we gotta do is figure out

32:56.801 --> 32:58.379
which one's in the crypt.

33:02.360 --> 33:05.101
Well, '79 and '81...

33:05.241 --> 33:07.881
they're the only years
when just one kid went missin'.

33:07.951 --> 33:10.220
Jesse Johnson and LeShawn Simms

33:10.641 --> 33:12.535
in October, 20th and 21st.

33:12.551 --> 33:14.351
Oh, and this one, too.

33:14.367 --> 33:15.591
October 19th.

33:15.688 --> 33:18.505
Well, let's start
taking down the ones

33:18.521 --> 33:20.631
- that wasn't nabbed in October.
- Right.

33:31.805 --> 33:32.901
That's 13?

33:32.971 --> 33:35.415
Bunt Jackson, LeShawn Simms.

33:35.438 --> 33:36.618
That's our 13.

33:36.768 --> 33:38.183
Why these?

33:38.611 --> 33:40.788
Either they're random killings

33:40.804 --> 33:43.014
or connected to the killer
in some way.

33:43.282 --> 33:44.838
Kinda look like Idaho.

33:44.854 --> 33:45.985
Yeah.

33:46.172 --> 33:47.547
And Idaho...

33:47.808 --> 33:49.325
runs around...

33:50.609 --> 33:51.757
Cooperstown.

33:59.652 --> 34:00.869
Boss.

34:07.578 --> 34:09.141
You know how crazy this is?

34:09.328 --> 34:10.187
What?

34:10.859 --> 34:12.518
We're just havin' lunch, Charlie.

34:12.534 --> 34:15.025
- He ain't that stupid.
- Just be cool.

34:15.340 --> 34:16.870
What can I get y'all?

34:16.886 --> 34:18.686
Coffee'll be fine.
Thank you, ma'am.

34:19.460 --> 34:20.474
You, sir?

34:20.543 --> 34:21.822
Uh, same.

34:22.070 --> 34:23.292
You got it.

34:24.625 --> 34:25.856
Thank you.

34:31.781 --> 34:35.024
So Valentine tells us
to let Pine go,

34:35.618 --> 34:38.589
then we find out
Valentine took the shoes.

34:38.891 --> 34:41.065
I mean, aren't you curious
about what he's up to?

34:41.187 --> 34:42.369
Yeah.

34:43.219 --> 34:44.766
Maybe the rumors are true,

34:45.125 --> 34:47.014
that Valentine
paid the cops off the night

34:47.031 --> 34:49.835
that Beau Otis killed
them fellas' daddies.

34:50.777 --> 34:53.165
They say Beau was
drunk as a skunk.

34:53.534 --> 34:55.502
True or not, that gets out,

34:55.565 --> 34:56.885
what you think happens

34:56.900 --> 34:58.896
to Judge Otis' chance
of gettin' re-elected?

34:59.182 --> 35:02.784
Unless the shoes tie Collins
to the murder somehow.

35:03.924 --> 35:06.187
Is it possible he might
be blackmailing Valentine?

35:06.636 --> 35:08.972
Nah, no way.
He ain't that ballsy.

35:08.988 --> 35:09.863
Yeah?

35:10.863 --> 35:14.217
But you kill a kid, no matter
what the circumstances,

35:15.374 --> 35:17.175
might just grow you a pair.

35:19.424 --> 35:21.748
We been lookin' awful hard
at Leonard Pine.

35:21.764 --> 35:22.936
Yeah...

35:23.776 --> 35:25.660
'cause Valentine told us to.

35:26.646 --> 35:30.453
Just another way of sayin',
"Don't look at Hap Collins."

35:34.585 --> 35:37.637
Now each one of these dead kids
went missin' in October.

35:37.862 --> 35:39.181
Why October?

35:39.262 --> 35:42.002
Well, that's
the $64,000 question.

35:43.093 --> 35:44.563
October 18th one year,

35:45.047 --> 35:47.242
the 20th the next, 19th.

35:47.344 --> 35:48.761
Always different.

35:49.144 --> 35:52.156
What if it's not the date,
but the day that matters?

35:53.114 --> 35:54.714
- Huh?
- You know how sometimes

35:54.784 --> 35:56.819
your birthday fall on a Monday
one year and Tuesday the next?
