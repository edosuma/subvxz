02:56.709 --> 02:58.711

02:59.512 --> 03:02.715
Pittsburgh always just smells
like, you know, hard work

03:02.782 --> 03:04.517
and football to me.
It's just hard work

03:04.584 --> 03:05.718
and football and family.

03:05.785 --> 03:06.886
-That's it. In that order.
-There we go.

<i>In Pittsburgh, we have this</i>
<i>thing where the encouragement</i>

03:32.912 --> 03:34.814
can be tough
in a blue-collar town.

03:34.881 --> 03:36.282
In other words,
they're not just gonna go,

03:36.349 --> 03:37.750
"We think you're wonderful."

03:37.817 --> 03:39.919
They're gonna go, "You ain't
gonna do that. Prove it."

03:39.986 --> 03:42.989
<i>So the thing about Marianne was</i>
<i>when Joe and I were</i>

03:43.056 --> 03:46.559
<i>planning to go to California</i>
<i>and chase this dream, you know,</i>

03:46.626 --> 03:49.996
she was one of those people
where they didn't do that.

03:50.063 --> 03:52.532
They-they just said,
"I believe in you.

03:52.599 --> 03:55.635
"And I think if you follow
this hard enough and you work

03:55.702 --> 03:57.570
hard enough,
that you guys can do this."

03:57.637 --> 03:59.539
And you don't forget
those things in your ears,

03:59.606 --> 04:01.407
especially looking back, you go,

04:01.474 --> 04:03.576
"Wow, that was a person
that believed in us

04:03.643 --> 04:06.412
when I'm not sure we believed
in this," you know what I mean?

04:06.479 --> 04:09.916
And then she's got the greatest
greeting of any human being.

04:09.983 --> 04:10.883
Whenever she sees me,

04:10.950 --> 04:12.619
I feel like
I'm the only person on Earth.

04:12.685 --> 04:14.587
Like, I walk in and she goes,

04:14.654 --> 04:16.756
-"Billy!" And it is...
-Aw!

04:16.823 --> 04:18.524
-It's like you're...
I'm home, you know?
-Right.

04:18.591 --> 04:20.960
And then she starts feeding you,
and, you know, we start

04:21.027 --> 04:23.496
laughing,
and it's just family and...

04:23.563 --> 04:26.866
and I wanted
to not only thank her,

04:26.933 --> 04:30.903
but I wanted to do this
as respect to my best friend

04:30.970 --> 04:33.873
who has been
with me the whole ride.

04:33.940 --> 04:36.643
So this is my way
of thanking him as much

04:36.709 --> 04:39.912
as showing my love
for Marianne as well.

04:39.979 --> 04:42.749
Okay, so what
does Marianne know?

04:42.815 --> 04:45.551
BILLY:
Well, uh, I had to tell
her something

04:45.618 --> 04:47.453
-or she wouldn't open the door.
-(laughs)

04:47.520 --> 04:50.390
So, uh, what I've told her is,
"Hey, we're gonna just

04:50.456 --> 04:52.659
-just do some small things
around the house for ya."
-Okay.

04:52.725 --> 04:54.761
She has no idea the scope
of what you guys are gonna do.

04:54.827 --> 04:56.829
Oh, then we're gonna hit her
with the hee-haw. I love it.

04:56.896 --> 04:58.564
-This is gonna be awesome, okay.
-Okay, let's go meet her.

04:58.631 --> 05:00.667
I'm excited.

05:00.733 --> 05:02.568
-I'm gonna let you knock
on the door. 'Cause she...
-Yes, yes.

05:02.635 --> 05:04.637
-She might open the door
and say, "Who are you?"
-That's right.

05:05.772 --> 05:07.573

05:07.640 --> 05:08.941

It's all for Marianne.

07:09.262 --> 07:12.064

Exactly.

07:47.767 --> 07:51.470
The best thing to do here
is... let's start over.

07:51.537 --> 07:54.040
Taking that porch area and
turning it into a three-season

07:54.106 --> 07:56.509
<i>room is not an easy renovation.</i>

07:56.576 --> 07:59.512
<i>New foundation,</i>
<i>new walls, new windows.</i>

07:59.579 --> 08:02.014
It's like basically
building an addition.

08:02.081 --> 08:03.583
Yeah, I'd like
it to be comfortable

08:03.649 --> 08:05.885
for them to come out,
like another living room,

08:05.952 --> 08:06.886
<i>but out back.</i>

08:06.953 --> 08:07.820
If you really do want
to watch football games,

08:07.887 --> 08:09.889
-we get a TV out there.
-Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

08:09.956 --> 08:12.258
-A little bar area.
-Wait, wait.
Does she watch football?

08:12.325 --> 08:14.026
-Oh, come on, now...
-You know what, Sabrina?

08:14.093 --> 08:16.095
This is Steeler country.

08:16.162 --> 08:17.864
Everybody watches...
when you come out of the womb

08:17.930 --> 08:19.699
-in the hospital and they have
you watch football.
-Really?

08:19.765 --> 08:21.634
They put you in a jersey,
not a diaper.

08:21.701 --> 08:23.002
-That's right,
that's exactly right.
-Okay.

08:23.069 --> 08:24.704
I'm new to all of this,
but that's fine.

08:24.770 --> 08:27.273
I love the idea of having
an extended patio out here, too.

08:27.340 --> 08:29.842
Okay. So if this is going to be
now a screened-in patio,

08:29.909 --> 08:31.143
-perhaps an extension?
-Yes.

08:31.210 --> 08:32.945
The only thing in my design eye

08:33.012 --> 08:35.548
-that I cannot deal with...
-It's driving her crazy.

08:35.615 --> 08:37.016
What's driving me crazy
is this fence.

08:37.083 --> 08:40.519
There's no way that I can
finish this backyard space

08:40.586 --> 08:43.089
-and not put up a new fence.
-ROB: Oh, yeah.

08:43.155 --> 08:46.058
-Oh, yeah?
-Can we please upgrade
the chain-link fence?

08:46.125 --> 08:48.294
<i>You have a whole</i>
<i>new screened-in porch,</i>

08:48.361 --> 08:50.897
beautiful furniture,
and a chain-link fence? No way.

08:50.963 --> 08:54.567
<i>A three-season room</i>
<i>is exactly what Marianne needs,</i>

08:54.634 --> 08:56.068
<i>but it's definitely gonna</i>
<i>be a lot of work.</i>

08:56.135 --> 08:58.204
<i>We need to rip out</i>
<i>and pour a new foundation,</i>

08:58.271 --> 09:01.207
<i>replace the supporting beams,</i>
<i>and frame up the walls.</i>

09:01.274 --> 09:04.777
<i>And then we can add big windows</i>
<i>for beautiful views year round.</i>

09:04.844 --> 09:08.014
<i>We'll lay down stylish floor</i>
<i>tiles and then bring in lots</i>

09:08.080 --> 09:10.316
<i>of comfy furniture and a new TV</i>

09:10.383 --> 09:12.952
<i>so Marianne can watch</i>
<i>the big game.</i>

09:13.019 --> 09:14.954
<i>But we'll also</i>
<i>be giving the backyard</i>

09:15.021 --> 09:17.890
<i>a facelift with a new</i>
<i>stone patio and walkway.</i>

09:17.957 --> 09:20.960
<i>And the chain-link fence</i>
<i>has got to go, so we'll replace</i>

09:21.027 --> 09:24.096
<i>it with some sort of white vinyl</i>
<i>to finish everything off.</i>

09:24.163 --> 09:26.565
So here we go.
This is Mare's bedroom.

09:26.632 --> 09:28.834
-NISCHELLE: Okay, yes,
absolutely.
-BILLY: We want to upgrade her.

09:28.901 --> 09:31.270
I-I just want her to have...

09:32.204 --> 09:34.340
NISCHELLE:

09:32.204 --> 09:34.340
She's a queen,
and she deserves a lair.

09:34.407 --> 09:36.242
-I get a little emotional,
but...
-No.

09:36.309 --> 09:38.244
...but I just, I want her,
I want her to know

09:38.311 --> 09:41.247
-how much that meant to us,
you know what I mean?
-Yeah.

09:41.314 --> 09:43.149
-Sorry about that...
-No!

09:43.215 --> 09:45.685
So it's important, the one
thing, though, the one thing.

09:45.751 --> 09:46.986
This rocker cannot be changed.

09:47.053 --> 09:48.621
-ROB: Okay.
-That-that's been in the family.

09:48.688 --> 09:49.922
Every kid in the family
has been rocked

09:49.989 --> 09:51.857
in that chair, so we
cannot move that rocker.

09:51.924 --> 09:54.226
-NISCHELLE:
We got to keep this
-Or you put it where you want,

09:54.293 --> 09:55.728
but we got to take care of that.
Everything else,

09:55.795 --> 09:57.263
I'd love you
to get her everything new.

09:57.330 --> 09:59.598
<i>SABRINA:</i>
<i>Marianne's bedroom is</i>
<i>really small,</i>

09:59.665 --> 10:01.867
<i>so renovating it</i>
<i>should be pretty easy.</i>

10:01.934 --> 10:04.103
<i>We'll rip out the old</i>
<i>carpeting and hopefully</i>

10:04.170 --> 10:06.339
<i>find decent wood floor</i>
<i>that we can refinish.</i>

10:06.405 --> 10:08.741
<i>Then we'll brighten up</i>
<i>the room and give the space</i>

10:08.808 --> 10:10.943
<i>a facelift to modern comfy-cozy</i>

10:11.010 --> 10:13.746
<i>with a new bedroom set,</i>
<i>and beautiful artwork</i>

10:13.813 --> 10:15.848
<i>to match</i>
<i>her beautiful personality.</i>

10:15.915 --> 10:18.184
-Okay, you guys have
packing to do.
-BOTH: Yes.

10:18.250 --> 10:20.953
You've got demo to do.
Now that we've added this

10:21.020 --> 10:23.356
extra room,
we're gonna be tight on time.

10:23.422 --> 10:24.824
I want to start here and just

10:24.890 --> 10:26.025
get this place
cleared out because to me,

10:26.092 --> 10:27.393
like, this is gonna be...

10:27.460 --> 10:28.995
-my jam.
-Okay.

10:29.061 --> 10:30.796
-All right, well, listen--
-You hear what's coming?

10:30.863 --> 10:33.065
You hear it?
It's coming, here it comes.

10:33.132 --> 10:35.768
-I've got things to do, Rob.
-This is where Nischelle...

10:35.835 --> 10:37.870
-I've got things to do.
-SABRINA: She's got such a plan.

10:37.937 --> 10:40.139
I do, I got a plan for this guy.
He's back home.

10:40.206 --> 10:41.841
-You guys are gonna have
a great time.
-BILLY: Love it.

10:41.907 --> 10:43.743
-I'm so excited.
-You know I'm gonna
be back to check

10:43.809 --> 10:46.679
-on y'all, you know I am.
Go team!
-Thanks, Nischelle.

10:46.746 --> 10:48.714
Let's get everything
out of here and I'll make sure

10:48.781 --> 10:49.949
this guy goes somewhere safe.

10:50.016 --> 10:52.385
-I got some boxes.
-SABRINA: Oh, my gosh.

10:54.286 --> 10:55.921
-I'm behind you, Rob.
-All right, okay.

10:55.988 --> 10:58.991
I need to just completely clear
out Marianne's bedroom

10:59.058 --> 11:02.061
and start from scratch,
down to the hardwood floors.

11:02.128 --> 11:04.296
What if we pull
this up and the, like,

11:04.363 --> 11:06.298
the wood floors are in shambles?

11:06.365 --> 11:08.401
Well, we're gonna see.
We have to see.

11:08.467 --> 11:10.703
-So we're gonna take it out...
-Right? But there's no,
like, there's no

11:10.770 --> 11:12.905
possibility that we're gonna put
carpet back down, right?

11:12.972 --> 11:14.240
I mean, if it's horrible,
then maybe.

11:14.306 --> 11:16.342
-BILLY: We're gonna
open the present.
-ROB: How do you know?

11:16.409 --> 11:19.445
-You don't know unless you try.
-Because I need to hear from you

11:19.512 --> 11:21.380
that no matter
what condition these wood floors

11:21.447 --> 11:23.015
are in, we're still
gonna refinish them

11:23.082 --> 11:24.316
-No matter what.
-No matter what.

11:24.383 --> 11:26.886
No matter what,
even if they're rotted, Billy.

11:26.952 --> 11:29.722
If there's a dead body
under this carpet...

11:29.789 --> 11:31.357
-We're staying with it.
That's it.
-...we're gonna refinish it,

11:31.424 --> 11:33.092
and it'll be good.

11:36.762 --> 11:38.464
ROB:
Oh, this is not
in bad shape at all.

11:38.531 --> 11:40.766
Sabrina, lookie-look.

11:40.833 --> 11:41.967
Look at how good
of shape it's in.

11:42.034 --> 11:43.202
SABRINA:
This is, like, jackpot.

11:43.269 --> 11:45.237
BILLY: Right?
They're in pretty good shape.

11:45.304 --> 11:46.972
Are you kidding me?
These floors look amazing.

11:47.039 --> 11:48.774
And they're 53 years old.

11:48.841 --> 11:50.476
And what do you want
to do about the walls?

11:50.543 --> 11:52.745
Because these walls
are textured.

11:52.812 --> 11:54.980
What if, as a favor to you...

11:55.047 --> 11:56.115
Here it comes, folks.

11:56.182 --> 11:59.218
Starting to feel like
Rob's outnumbered every show.

11:59.285 --> 12:01.754
-Yeah.
-Billy, you have no idea.

12:01.821 --> 12:04.156
What if we do, like,
a textured wallpaper?

12:04.223 --> 12:06.492
-Oh, that actually does help me.
-Yeah.

12:06.559 --> 12:08.194
'Cause then you don't have to
worry about it, then it's not

12:08.260 --> 12:10.162
something that's flat that's
gonna show all the texture.

12:10.229 --> 12:13.799
For once, Sabrina's idea
gives me less work to do.

12:13.866 --> 12:15.234
Mark it down.

12:15.301 --> 12:16.335
Back to work.

12:18.104 --> 12:20.773
Look at this. Boston
and Pittsburgh working together.

12:20.840 --> 12:23.142
-ROB: Oh, don't tell anybody.
-Come on, come on.

12:23.209 --> 12:25.444
We got to pick up
the, uh, tack strips.

12:25.511 --> 12:27.913
-All right.
-Just nice and easy. Pull it up.

12:27.980 --> 12:30.816
Making quick work over here.

12:30.883 --> 12:32.351
BILLY:
You're making quick work.

12:32.418 --> 12:34.487
Yeah. This is really nice
of you to do this.

12:34.553 --> 12:37.156
BILLY:
I think if you experience
some success in your life,

12:37.223 --> 12:40.259
if you don't spread that around,
you don't deserve it.

12:40.326 --> 12:43.095
-Good job, brother.
-Absolutely.

12:44.230 --> 12:46.265
<i>ROB:</i>
<i>First things first,</i>

12:46.332 --> 12:47.766
we got to get rid
of all the, uh, furniture.

12:47.833 --> 12:50.369
-Bring it out to the front.
-All right.

12:50.436 --> 12:53.005
Listen, usually demolition
is the easiest part

12:53.072 --> 12:54.907
of the job and it goes quick.

12:54.974 --> 12:57.209
But in this job in particular,

12:57.276 --> 12:59.478
<i>we got a lot of foundation</i>
<i>that needs to come out.</i>

12:59.545 --> 13:02.314
My crew will be here
soon to start jackhammering,

13:02.381 --> 13:04.383
but I thought
I'll let Billy and Sabrina

13:04.450 --> 13:06.152
start for a little bit of fun.

13:06.218 --> 13:08.220
-But is it gonna go like this?
-Yes, yes.

13:08.287 --> 13:10.856
(laughs) I feel like
you're setting me up.

13:10.923 --> 13:12.158
It's pretty easy.

13:12.224 --> 13:13.492
It's just a hammer.

13:13.559 --> 13:15.194
There's one button.
That turns it on.

13:15.261 --> 13:17.296
I have never used
a jackhammer before.

13:17.363 --> 13:19.999
Zero is off. Zero is on?

13:20.065 --> 13:22.001
I'm gonna move-move
a little further this way.

13:22.067 --> 13:24.236
You're gonna find out,
you're gonna find out.

13:24.303 --> 13:26.071
Billy, you might want
to stand back a little bit.

13:26.138 --> 13:28.307
-Yeah. I got...
-Like, away from Sabrina.

13:28.374 --> 13:31.177
So I'm already starting
to regret this whole idea.

13:31.243 --> 13:32.511
Let's get to work. Let's go.

13:32.578 --> 13:35.047
All right, Mare,
this is for you.

13:38.083 --> 13:39.919
Keep going. Right here.

13:39.985 --> 13:41.420
Break up the floor
a little bit.

13:41.487 --> 13:44.156
It's too big of a piece.

13:44.223 --> 13:45.457
<i>These two are crazy.</i>

13:45.524 --> 13:47.126
<i>Their jackhammers</i>
<i>are going everywhere.</i>

13:47.193 --> 13:48.894
Really lean into it.

13:48.961 --> 13:51.597
At one point I looked over
and Sabrina's sledgehammering.

13:51.664 --> 13:53.866
Like that's gonna do anything.

13:53.933 --> 13:55.901
<i>But eventually they did get some</i>

13:55.968 --> 13:59.238
<i>of the concrete broken up...</i>
<i>and overall,</i>

13:59.305 --> 14:00.539
<i>they did a pretty good job.</i>

14:00.606 --> 14:02.041
All right, I'm gonna
take this up, Billy.

14:02.107 --> 14:03.409
I'm gonna be on a union five.

14:03.475 --> 14:06.078
-All right?
-All right, you take...
take five.

14:06.145 --> 14:08.214
I'm taking five.
God bless you, Rob.

14:08.948 --> 14:11.083
<i>ROB:</i>
<i>We've only got two weeks</i>
<i>for this renovation</i>

14:11.150 --> 14:15.854

<i>NISCHELLE:</i>
<i>Rob has some bad news</i>
<i>to share with Billy.</i>

14:25.531 --> 14:28.300

And this downspout?

14:28.367 --> 14:30.202
It's completely clogged.

14:30.269 --> 14:31.937
<i>-And later...</i>
-BILLY: I'm gonna take you

14:32.004 --> 14:35.107

14:35.174 --> 14:37.209
<i>...Billy takes me</i>
<i>on a walk down memory lane...</i>

14:37.276 --> 14:38.377
This is some of
the greatest old wooden

14:38.444 --> 14:40.279
roller coasters
in the country here.

14:40.346 --> 14:40.946
<i>...with a visit</i>

<i>his best friend's mom</i>
<i>with a home renovation.</i>

15:03.335 --> 15:04.903
-Billy!
<i>-A home</i>

<i>Marianne O'Connell has</i>

<i>Marianne is more than Billy's</i>

15:11.243 --> 15:13.412
<i>best friend's mom. She's family.</i>

15:13.479 --> 15:15.481
<i>BILLY:</i>
<i>When you get successful,</i>
<i>it's very important</i>

15:15.547 --> 15:17.650
<i>to come back</i>
<i>and pay back the people</i>

15:17.716 --> 15:19.585
<i>that inspired you as you went.</i>

15:19.652 --> 15:22.321
You don't forget people early in
your life that tell you

when you tell them a dream

15:24.490 --> 15:26.659
<i>that you can do it,</i>

<i>They help you reassure yourself</i>

<i>In Marianne's bedroom,</i>

15:50.549 --> 15:51.583
<i>Once it dries,</i>

15:51.650 --> 15:53.218
<i>we can start the construction.</i>

15:53.285 --> 15:54.953
<i>But first,</i>
<i>I have a little bad news</i>

15:55.020 --> 15:56.422
<i>to give Billy.</i>

15:56.488 --> 15:58.123
This is what
I wanted to talk to you about.

15:58.190 --> 16:00.392
-Okay.
-See this top gutter here
and this downspout

16:00.459 --> 16:01.994
-that brings the water down?
-Yeah.

16:02.061 --> 16:04.029
It entered
into this French drain,

16:04.096 --> 16:06.131
-and it's completely clogged.
-Okay.

16:06.198 --> 16:07.633
-Just years
and years of sediment.
-Yeah.

16:07.700 --> 16:10.269
You can see the damage
it's done pulling the stairs

16:10.336 --> 16:11.970
-away from the house.
-Okay.

16:12.037 --> 16:13.672
So what I'd like to do
is re-route it

16:13.739 --> 16:15.474
into the other gutter system
on the other

16:15.541 --> 16:18.277
-side to the working drain.
-All right. Okay.

16:18.344 --> 16:20.512
Additionally, over here, I'm
going to eliminate these stairs

16:20.579 --> 16:23.148
because we're going
to have a three-season room.

16:23.215 --> 16:27.119
So what I was thinking is,
we extend this retaining wall

16:27.186 --> 16:29.121
about nine feet,
and, you know, obviously,

16:29.188 --> 16:31.056
-we've got
an elevation change here.
-Yeah.

16:31.123 --> 16:33.659
-So we'll end up putting
a staircase here.
-Okay.

16:33.726 --> 16:36.061
-So that way,
she'll still be able to go out.
-That's great.

16:36.128 --> 16:37.563
-We'll put a railing here,
and...
-Great.

16:37.629 --> 16:39.598
...you know, I think
we'll be in good shape.

16:39.665 --> 16:42.534
The idea that this is going
to be redone for her and a place

16:42.601 --> 16:44.670
that we can be out there
in different seasons,

16:44.737 --> 16:46.271
<i>and I-I just think it's gonna</i>

16:46.338 --> 16:47.606
<i>bring a lot of joy</i>
<i>to the family.</i>

16:47.673 --> 16:49.408
She's going
to be blown away by this.

16:49.475 --> 16:51.110
Marianne is going
to go nuts for this.

16:51.176 --> 16:53.345
-I cannot redo all this--
-Right.

16:53.412 --> 16:55.447
the patio, her room--
and not replace this fence.

16:55.514 --> 16:57.216
-Yeah, that's good.
-The chain-link?

16:57.282 --> 16:59.017
-That's good.
-Come on.
-Okay.

16:59.084 --> 17:01.653
-This reminds me
of elementary school.
-So how about...?

17:01.720 --> 17:04.156
The only thing is, it's got
to be something low-maintenance.

17:04.223 --> 17:05.758
That's what I was going to say.

17:05.824 --> 17:07.559
It's the same words
you would use to describe me.

17:07.626 --> 17:09.561
-We need...
-(laughing)

17:09.628 --> 17:11.463
Bill... No. Okay.

17:11.530 --> 17:13.065
Never mind. Never mind.

17:13.132 --> 17:14.767
I hear you. What about height?

17:14.833 --> 17:16.168
When these all bloom
in the fall,

17:16.235 --> 17:17.369
you want to see the colors, so,

17:17.436 --> 17:19.238
I think about the same height
or maybe a little higher.

17:19.304 --> 17:21.240
-Okay.
-But-but enough so the dog
don't... With the dogs.

17:21.306 --> 17:22.708
-Oh, there's a dog. Okay.
-We don't want...

17:22.775 --> 17:24.309
-We should probably...
-Okay, so we want to make sure

17:24.376 --> 17:25.711
-it's tight together
and tight to the ground.
-Yeah.

17:25.778 --> 17:28.046
Yes. It's going to polish
this entire back space.

17:28.113 --> 17:29.448
Yeah.

17:37.856 --> 17:40.359
<i>ROB:</i>
<i>So we're done with all the demo,</i>
<i>and the foundation</i>

17:40.426 --> 17:42.461
<i>is finally dry, so Marianne's</i>

17:42.528 --> 17:45.130
three-season room is finally
about to take off.

17:46.799 --> 17:49.802
<i>We're putting in</i>
<i>new support beams...</i>

17:49.868 --> 17:52.604
<i>and framing everything out.</i>

17:58.644 --> 17:59.611
<i>When we're done,</i>

17:59.678 --> 18:01.313
<i>it'll have beautiful windows</i>

18:01.380 --> 18:04.349
<i>that she can sit</i>
<i>and look out year round.</i>

18:04.416 --> 18:06.418
<i>And with a new TV there,</i>
<i>I don't think</i>

18:06.485 --> 18:08.353
<i>Marianne will ever want</i>
<i>to leave it.</i>

18:09.888 --> 18:11.390
<i>And we're building</i>
<i>a new retaining wall</i>

18:11.457 --> 18:14.126
<i>that will address</i>
<i>the drainage issue.</i>

18:14.193 --> 18:16.195
-These are the bluestone pavers
to finish the patio.
-Awesome.

18:16.261 --> 18:18.263
-All right.
-Can we just put them
in the garage for now?

18:18.330 --> 18:20.866
-SABRINA: Sure.
-Yeah, sure. Thank you, sir.

18:22.367 --> 18:24.870
-ROB: Why is Nischelle here?
-I don't know.

18:24.937 --> 18:26.705
-Hi, kids.
-BILLY: Hey.
-ROB: Hi, Nischelle.

18:26.772 --> 18:28.207
What's going on?

18:28.273 --> 18:31.210
Oh, you know,
I came to steal Billy.

18:31.276 --> 18:33.812
-Because...
-Oh, but I was having
so much fun.

18:33.879 --> 18:35.214
Oh, you knew about this.
Look at him.

18:35.280 --> 18:36.815
I'm so sorry.
I'm so happy to see you.

18:36.882 --> 18:38.817
-You see that?
I know the look of a liar.
-I don't know any...

18:38.884 --> 18:40.452
-Let's just listen.
-I've done that on<i> Survivor.</i>

18:40.519 --> 18:41.820
I hope I wasn't supposed
to protect you.

18:41.887 --> 18:43.422
I wanted
to help you all day, Rob.

18:43.489 --> 18:44.723
I'm so sorry.
What are we gonna do, Nischelle?

18:44.790 --> 18:45.924
No, really, he had...
he had a couple of things.

18:45.991 --> 18:47.693
You said you had a couple
things you wanted to show me.

18:47.759 --> 18:48.760
I have a very special place
in Pittsburgh I want

18:48.827 --> 18:50.696
-Yeah, absolutely.
-...to take you. I'm so sorry

18:50.762 --> 18:52.431
-it falls right
in the middle of this.
-Sorry.

18:52.498 --> 18:53.832
-Yeah.
-You go ahead, have fun.
-I'm gonna do you a favor.

18:53.899 --> 18:55.334
-I'm gonna get out of your way.
-You guys are gonna have

18:55.400 --> 18:57.236
-such a great day.
-You guys are the best.

18:57.302 --> 18:58.470
-We're not gonna have any fun
at all.
-No. At all. None.

18:58.537 --> 19:00.239
-You guys keep after it, though.
-We'll be back.

19:00.305 --> 19:01.306
-I promise I'll bring him back.
I will.
-God bless you.

19:01.373 --> 19:03.375
-That's it. Yeah.
-We'll see. Have a good time.

19:03.442 --> 19:04.910
-You drive.
-All right,
we're gonna go have some fun.

19:08.380 --> 19:10.916
I'm gonna take you to the most
magical place in my childhood.

19:10.983 --> 19:13.652
-NISCHELLE: Oh.
-It's a wonderful amusement park

19:13.719 --> 19:17.356
called Kennywood, and, uh, it's
got great old roller coasters,

19:17.422 --> 19:19.491
wooden roller coasters,
100 years old.

19:19.558 --> 19:21.593
It was one of my favorite places
to go as a kid.

19:21.660 --> 19:24.363
-Oh.
-I mean, literally one
of those magical places,

19:24.429 --> 19:26.265
when you're a kid,
you're like, "I don't ever want

19:26.331 --> 19:27.766
to leave this place."
I made a call.

19:27.833 --> 19:29.301
We're going
to get the VIP treatment.

19:29.368 --> 19:31.169
-Excuse me.
-Yeah, we got everything

19:31.236 --> 19:32.404
to ourselves
for at least an hour. Look.

19:32.471 --> 19:34.373
There. You can see it.
It's right over there.

19:34.439 --> 19:36.408
Oh, my God, look. Oh, yeah.

19:36.475 --> 19:37.809
-You can see the roller coaster.
-There we go.

19:37.876 --> 19:39.478
That's Kennywood.

19:40.979 --> 19:43.215
-BILLY: Yeah.
-Kennywood?
You got me, 'cause

19:43.282 --> 19:44.483
-I'm an amusement park
kind of girl.
-Good.

19:44.550 --> 19:45.751
-You're gonna love this, then.
-Yes.

19:45.817 --> 19:47.853
<i>BILLY: There are new, updated</i>
<i>rides, but they kept part</i>

19:47.920 --> 19:50.389
of the old amusement park
from the original days there.

19:50.455 --> 19:51.890
And I think
that's the heartbeat.

19:51.957 --> 19:53.659
And when I go in there,
I turn into a nine-year-old.

19:53.725 --> 19:57.496
All right, now, these are the
old-time games where you can win

19:57.563 --> 19:59.565
a stuffed animal. All right,
how about this game over here?

19:59.631 --> 20:02.434
-Oh. I mean, come on.
-You can win a giant banana.

20:02.501 --> 20:04.503
Well, I always want
to hit the middle. Oh.

20:04.570 --> 20:07.205
-Just one. (laughs)
-Why-why can't I...?

20:07.272 --> 20:09.207
I mean, I'm two feet away.

20:09.274 --> 20:10.576
Oh! How about that?
How about that?

20:10.642 --> 20:12.978
-Huh? Come on now.
-How do you like me now?

20:13.045 --> 20:14.947
Okay, one last time.

20:15.013 --> 20:16.515
-Aw. (laughs)
-Here you go.

20:16.582 --> 20:18.617
I present you your first
Kennywood win right here.

20:18.684 --> 20:20.852
There you are.
Congratulations.

20:20.919 --> 20:22.955
-This is the Jack Rabbit?
-This is the Jack Rabbit,

20:23.021 --> 20:25.991
The big attraction on the Jack
Rabbit was it has a double dip.

20:26.058 --> 20:27.225
Sweet.
This is where we're going?

20:27.292 --> 20:29.595
-This is where we're going.
-Me, you and our blue banana.

20:29.661 --> 20:31.296
I wonder if they'll let us
take this on there with us.

20:31.363 --> 20:32.731
-Can we take him with us?
-BILLY: Can...?

20:32.798 --> 20:33.932
Hi. Can we put him
in the coaster with us?

20:33.999 --> 20:35.601
-Oh, we can?
-Yeah.
-All right.

20:35.667 --> 20:37.603
-He's gonna go with us.
-Oh, you're going
with us, buddy.

20:37.669 --> 20:39.605
-All right.
-That's it..

20:40.272 --> 20:42.007
-Okay.
-You ready? You ready?
-Uh, ready?

20:42.074 --> 20:43.775
-All right.
-All right. Let's go.

20:43.842 --> 20:46.278
-I'm nervous!
-(Billy laughs)

20:46.345 --> 20:47.279
NISCHELLE:
This is going to be good.

20:47.346 --> 20:49.247
The Jack Rabbit was amazing.

20:49.314 --> 20:50.582
How'd you talk me into this,

20:50.649 --> 20:52.017
-Billy Gardell?
-Ah...

20:52.084 --> 20:53.585
<i>BILLY: I got the same feeling</i>
<i>riding it that I did</i>

20:53.652 --> 20:54.953
when I was a kid,
so it was really a treat.

20:55.020 --> 20:56.655
All right,
there's the rollercoaster noise

20:56.722 --> 20:59.992
you wait for.
This is the anxiety, right?

21:00.058 --> 21:01.460
Nischelle, I think,
really enjoyed herself.

21:01.526 --> 21:02.761
-(screaming)
-Yeah!

21:02.828 --> 21:05.764
<i>And she's funny</i>
<i>because she's hysterical</i>

21:05.831 --> 21:06.865
on the roller coaster.

21:06.932 --> 21:07.933
Ready for one more?

21:08.000 --> 21:08.934
-Oh, my, this is enough.
-One more.

21:09.001 --> 21:11.303
-Ooh. Yeah.
-(yelling)

21:11.370 --> 21:13.805
But then, as soon as it's over,
she's ready to go again.

21:13.872 --> 21:15.841
-Awesome as the first time.
-Can we go again?

21:15.907 --> 21:17.609
<i>So, it was very fun</i>
<i>to get to turn her onto that</i>

21:17.676 --> 21:19.945
and go do that with her.
It was cool.

21:20.012 --> 21:22.547
And our banana made it safely.

21:22.614 --> 21:23.915
-The Banana!
-(Billy laughs)

21:23.982 --> 21:25.817
Best day ever!

21:30.656 --> 21:32.424
Oh, shoot.

21:32.491 --> 21:34.326
-Oh. (laughing)
-That's Kenny Kangaroo.

21:34.393 --> 21:37.062
Can't sneak up on people, Kenny.
What's wrong with you?

21:37.129 --> 21:39.464
-Perfect.
-Thank you so much, man.
-Thank you.

21:39.531 --> 21:40.866
<i>-BILLY: Appreciate it.</i>
<i>-Thank you, Kenny.</i>

21:43.402 --> 21:45.537
<i>NISCHELLE: Just when it seemed</i>
<i>like smooth sailing,</i>

21:45.604 --> 21:47.406
<i>Mother Nature decided</i>

21:47.472 --> 21:50.642
<i>to disrupt Billy and the team's</i>
<i>renovation schedule.</i>

21:50.709 --> 21:52.611
-This rain is a pain.
-Does nothing for construction

21:52.678 --> 21:54.446
and nothing for my hair.

21:54.513 --> 21:57.516
<i>NISCHELLE: And in an emotional</i>
<i>moment you won't want to miss,</i>

21:57.582 --> 21:59.818
<i>Billy takes Rob</i>
<i>to the local watering hole.</i>

21:59.885 --> 22:01.687
-Hey, Billy.
-Rocco! How are you, my brother?

22:01.753 --> 22:03.355
<i>NISCHELLE:</i>
<i>But Rob has a surprise</i>

22:03.422 --> 22:05.057
<i>to honor Billy's late father.</i>

22:05.123 --> 22:06.458
Ah, man.

22:14.466 --> 22:15.767
<i>NISCHELLE:</i>
<i>Billy Gardell has been back home</i>

22:15.834 --> 22:17.569
<i>in Pittsburgh almost two weeks,</i>

22:17.636 --> 22:19.004
<i>where he's surprising</i>
<i>Marianne O'Connell</i>

22:19.071 --> 22:20.605
<i>with a home renovation,</i>

22:20.672 --> 22:23.575
<i>including an entirely</i>
<i>transformed bedroom</i>

22:23.642 --> 22:26.578
<i>and an amazing</i>
<i>outdoor three-season room.</i>

22:27.345 --> 22:31.883
<i>SABRINA:</i>
<i>So far, everything has</i>
<i>been running pretty smoothly.</i>

22:31.950 --> 22:34.920
<i>We've done a lot of work inside,</i>
<i>spackling</i>

22:34.986 --> 22:38.724
<i>and sanding Marianne's bedroom</i>
<i>to get it ready for wallpaper.</i>

22:38.790 --> 22:41.359
<i>The three-season room</i>
<i>is really taking shape</i>

22:41.426 --> 22:45.363
<i>with new walls, electric,</i>
<i>and the stylish floor tile</i>

22:45.430 --> 22:48.967
<i>I think Marianne is going</i>
<i>to love. I'm so excited</i>

22:49.034 --> 22:51.603
<i>that my white picket fence</i>
<i>arrived and started going in.</i>

22:51.670 --> 22:52.871
<i>But Billy also wanted a safe way</i>

22:52.938 --> 22:54.940
<i>for Marianne</i>
<i>to get into the backyard.</i>

22:55.006 --> 22:57.542
<i>So we ripped down the old pavers</i>
<i>and built her</i>

22:57.609 --> 23:02.614
<i>a new wider path which we topped</i>
<i>with beautiful bluestone pavers.</i>

23:06.485 --> 23:09.821
<i>It has been a lot of hard work,</i>
<i>but we made it to day nine, and</i>

23:09.888 --> 23:11.423
<i>the rain has made</i>
<i>another appearance.</i>

23:11.490 --> 23:13.058
<i>But that's not going to stop us</i>

23:13.125 --> 23:15.460
<i>from finishing off the patio.</i>

23:15.527 --> 23:16.962
-What else do you need?
-Just a two-foot level,

23:17.028 --> 23:18.296
and then, um,

23:18.363 --> 23:20.499
-the other stones
are right over there.
-More of the pavers.

23:20.565 --> 23:21.833
-Thank you.
-(sighs)

23:21.900 --> 23:23.702
Yeah, this rain is a pain
because...

23:23.769 --> 23:26.705
It does nothing for construction
and nothing for my hair.

23:26.772 --> 23:28.640
Well, I don't know
about your hair,

23:28.707 --> 23:31.176
but it's definitely
causing a problem back here,

23:31.243 --> 23:34.146
and we got a lot
to do before we finish.

23:34.212 --> 23:35.514
What do you think so far?

23:35.580 --> 23:36.982
-It looks great.
-Yeah?

23:37.048 --> 23:39.451
This is such an improvement
from what it looked like before!

23:39.518 --> 23:40.886
I know. I know, and

23:40.952 --> 23:43.088
with this retaining wall
coming out further,

23:43.155 --> 23:45.023
they're not going to have those
water issues inside the house.

23:45.090 --> 23:46.725
It's so amazing.

23:46.792 --> 23:48.493
-Yeah, so...
-What an upgrade.

23:48.560 --> 23:51.730
No doubt. A couple more here,
and we'll be good.

23:51.797 --> 23:53.732
<i>SABRINA:</i>
<i>I think Marianne is really going</i>

23:53.799 --> 23:55.567
<i>to love this stonework.</i>

23:55.634 --> 23:58.603
-Rain is not going to stop us.
-(laughs) No doubt.

23:58.670 --> 24:01.006
<i>SABRINA:</i>
<i>It looks great, and it's going</i>
<i>to last a long time,</i>

24:01.072 --> 24:02.440
so I'm super excited
to get it done.

24:04.242 --> 24:06.178
Sabrina, that's not how
we set a stone.

24:06.244 --> 24:09.080
<i>-SABRINA: I got dirty. (laughs)</i>
<i>-ROB: (laughs) Horrible.</i>

24:10.182 --> 24:11.783
<i>ROB:</i>
<i>This morning,</i>

24:11.850 --> 24:14.653
<i>we got the windows installed</i>
<i>in the three-season room.</i>

24:14.719 --> 24:18.056
And just in time for--
you guessed it-- more rain.

24:18.123 --> 24:20.759
Hey, Dan, I need this one
67 and three quarters.

24:20.826 --> 24:22.794
-All right. Perfect.
-Okay.

24:22.861 --> 24:23.795
<i>ROB:</i>
<i>So we switched it up</i>
<i>and finished</i>

24:23.862 --> 24:25.897
<i>all the trim work inside.</i>

24:25.964 --> 24:27.899
<i>And now</i>
<i>that it's cleared up a bit,</i>

24:27.966 --> 24:30.068
Billy and I are going
to finish off the new gutter.

24:30.135 --> 24:31.903
Can you hand me that last
12-foot section of downspout?

24:31.970 --> 24:33.772
BILLY:
Yes, sir, I can.

24:33.839 --> 24:35.040
-Okay.
-Hey, man, thanks a lot

24:35.106 --> 24:36.474
for going the extra mile

24:36.541 --> 24:38.176
and finding that
and fixing this.

24:38.243 --> 24:39.678
-Yeah, no problem.
-Really appreciate it.

24:39.744 --> 24:41.179
This will divert the water,
and then,

24:41.246 --> 24:43.515
we'll just put the 90 on the end

24:43.582 --> 24:46.685
-and drop it right in.
-All right. You got it.

24:46.751 --> 24:48.186
-It goes right...
-Here we go.

24:48.253 --> 24:50.488
-All right.
-Set it up.

24:50.555 --> 24:52.757
-All right.
-There you go.
And just slide it

24:52.824 --> 24:54.526
right down and in.
That will take the water

24:54.593 --> 24:57.529
right into this gutter,
run down that way.

24:57.596 --> 24:58.897
Solves that whole problem.

24:58.964 --> 25:00.198
-Thank you, Rob.
-All right, brother.

25:00.265 --> 25:01.833
It's hard not
to like you even though

25:01.900 --> 25:03.034
you're a Patriots fan.
You know that?

25:03.101 --> 25:04.970
If I was a decent guy,
I'd reciprocate

25:05.036 --> 25:08.206
about the Steelers,
but I got to stay me, Billy.

25:08.273 --> 25:09.941
-I understand, Rob. I respect.
-I hear you.

25:10.008 --> 25:11.810
<i>ROB:</i>
<i>You know,</i>
<i>I give Billy a hard time,</i>

25:11.877 --> 25:13.778
but Billy's a good guy.

25:13.845 --> 25:15.547
-That way, Rob,
away from the roof.
-Okay.

25:15.614 --> 25:17.849
-All right. Sounds good.
-(laughs)

25:21.720 --> 25:24.089
So these slide down. They're a
little tricky. We got to kind of

25:24.155 --> 25:26.224
work together.
So there's four on that side

25:26.291 --> 25:27.959
-I installed there.
-Okay.

25:28.026 --> 25:29.661
So let me get this side in.

25:29.728 --> 25:31.730
In. There we go.

25:31.796 --> 25:33.231
-BILLY: There you go.
Right on the money.
-Okay.

25:33.298 --> 25:36.668
So we'll just kind of finagle
the pole a little bit.

25:37.335 --> 25:39.271
-That's actually really easy.
-That's 'cause

25:39.337 --> 25:41.573
-I already did all the hard work
installing that.
-What?

25:41.640 --> 25:42.741
-Oh, oh, oh.
-I was gonna say, it's easy

25:42.807 --> 25:44.709
when Rob does all the work,
prep work,

25:44.776 --> 25:45.744
-first.
-Right there.

25:45.810 --> 25:48.146
Just bring one end in first.
Down, down, down.

25:48.213 --> 25:50.148
-All right.
-Right there.

25:50.215 --> 25:52.083
There it is.

25:52.150 --> 25:54.119
-BILLY: There we go.
-Perfect. Last one.

25:54.185 --> 25:55.687
How about...? Wait.
When we finish,

25:55.754 --> 25:56.988
how am I going to get
to the other side?

25:57.055 --> 25:58.156
-Well, that's why...
-Now's your chance.

25:58.223 --> 26:00.592
If you want to get on the other
side, now's your chance.

26:00.659 --> 26:01.927
Rob said to put you
on that side while we're...

26:01.993 --> 26:03.328
-I know.
-No, I'm just...

26:03.395 --> 26:04.796
Was this my end?

26:04.863 --> 26:06.331
-(laughs)
-Billy, if we... if we hurry,

26:06.398 --> 26:08.934
we can keep her out here.

26:09.000 --> 26:10.302
-There it is.
-Bada bing.

26:10.368 --> 26:11.937
Yeah, that's it.

26:12.003 --> 26:14.806
-All right, Sabrina,
good seeing you.
-Sabrina.

26:14.873 --> 26:17.142
-I'm fenced out.
-Right on.
-Let me get the gate for you.

26:17.208 --> 26:19.611
-Thank you, sir.
-You're welcome.

26:19.678 --> 26:21.079
-BILLY: Perfect.
-All right.

26:21.146 --> 26:22.647
-How's that?
-What do you think, Billy?
-Perfect.

26:22.714 --> 26:24.983
This is awesome
and unbelievable.

26:25.050 --> 26:27.185
-She is going to love this.
It's so storybook.
-Come on.

26:27.252 --> 26:28.353
SABRINA: This is...
this is such an upgrade

26:28.420 --> 26:29.955
from the chain-link fence.

26:30.021 --> 26:31.690
-I love everything you've done.
-ROB: Yeah. Thank you.

26:31.756 --> 26:33.858
You know, with Billy
and Sabrina both helping,

26:33.925 --> 26:35.694
not only are we going
to get done a lot faster,

26:35.760 --> 26:37.262
but they made it a lot of fun.

26:37.329 --> 26:41.967
This will, uh,
at least give a little bit

26:42.033 --> 26:43.601
of extra support
going up these stairs for her.

26:43.668 --> 26:44.936
Yeah. No, absolutely.

26:45.003 --> 26:46.805
Boston Rob has been
a pleasure to work with,

26:46.871 --> 26:48.707
and you can really see the pride
he takes in his work.

26:48.773 --> 26:50.275
He's just a good,
down-to-earth guy.

26:50.342 --> 26:52.143
I want to take you to my old
neighborhood and buy you a beer.

26:52.210 --> 26:53.845
-We're finally going
to go to Rocco's?
-I'm...

26:53.912 --> 26:55.280
I'm taking you to Rocco's.
That's right.

26:55.347 --> 26:58.149
I've been hearing about Rocco
for the last two weeks.

26:58.216 --> 26:59.851
This is the moment
I've been waiting for.

26:59.918 --> 27:02.687
So I'm going to have my guys
finish up the railing.

27:02.754 --> 27:04.155
-Ready for some suds?
-Let's do it.

27:04.222 --> 27:05.890
You're going to wear that hat?

27:05.957 --> 27:07.359
I mean, Billy,
this goes everywhere with me.

27:07.425 --> 27:10.328
-Come on. (laughs)
-All right, man. I warned you.

27:11.496 --> 27:14.699
BILLY:
Now I want to say a proper
blue-collar thank you,

27:14.766 --> 27:15.834
and I can't think
of a better way to do that

27:15.900 --> 27:17.168
than the local bar

27:17.235 --> 27:18.837
that literally was the place

27:18.903 --> 27:20.338
that we grew up around,
you know?

27:20.405 --> 27:21.906
-I appreciate it, man.
-And you'll love

27:21.973 --> 27:23.408
this guy, too, man.

27:23.475 --> 27:25.043
You'll love Auggie Rocco.
He's a classic.

27:25.110 --> 27:27.412
<i>Rocco's Tavern is</i>
<i>a neighborhood institution.</i>

27:27.479 --> 27:30.315
You don't see those places
too much anymore, you know?

27:30.382 --> 27:32.817
<i>Rocco, who owns the place,</i>
<i>I love him to death.</i>

27:32.884 --> 27:35.887
<i>It's been a family-run bar</i>
<i>for over 75 years.</i>

27:35.954 --> 27:37.689
<i>My father used to go there,</i>

27:37.756 --> 27:39.924
<i>and, you know,</i>
<i>he had his own chair there, and</i>

27:39.991 --> 27:42.260
it's just very much the
neighborhood gathering joint.

27:42.327 --> 27:44.662
I'm gonna take you
through my alley.

27:44.729 --> 27:46.898
-Okay.
-'Cause I grew up...
I grew up in an alley.

27:46.965 --> 27:48.933
We would always get six
or seven of us,

27:49.000 --> 27:50.935
and then we'd get a good
Wiffle Ball game going.

27:51.002 --> 27:52.804
<i>-ROB: Yeah.</i>
<i>-And what we would do is,</i>

27:52.871 --> 27:55.440
<i>we would mark these yards.</i>
<i>Like,</i>

27:55.507 --> 27:57.208
if you hit it in that yard,
that was a single

27:57.275 --> 27:59.944
'cause the guy would let us
go get the ball.

28:00.011 --> 28:02.180
There's always one guy,
if you hit it in his yard,

28:02.247 --> 28:03.815
you're gonna get killed if you
don't get it out fast enough.

28:03.882 --> 28:05.683
-This is him.
-This is him.

28:05.750 --> 28:07.952
-This is the guy.
-What was his name?
Tell me his name.

28:08.019 --> 28:10.955
-Mr. Scanlon.
-Mr. Scanlon.

28:11.022 --> 28:12.090
Aah, we hated him.

28:12.891 --> 28:14.459
-ROB: And this is it.
-When you were underage,

28:14.526 --> 28:16.461
-this is what you aspired to.
-Yup.

28:16.528 --> 28:17.896
BILLY:
To be able to go have a beer

28:17.962 --> 28:19.230
with the guys at Rocco's,

28:19.297 --> 28:20.432
and I'm happy
to bring you in here.

28:20.498 --> 28:22.233
-Hey, Billy.
-Rocco! How are you, my brother?

28:22.300 --> 28:24.169
Give me a hug, kiddo.

28:24.235 --> 28:26.104
-Good to see you, baby.
Good to see you.
-How are you?

28:26.171 --> 28:28.073
-Is this your friend?
-This is Boston Rob.

28:28.139 --> 28:30.241
This is a Pittsburgh bar. You're
gonna have to take your hat off.

28:30.308 --> 28:32.477
Listen, this comes with me
everywhere I go.

28:32.544 --> 28:34.145
-I read a lot about you.
-This man's done a lot of work.

28:34.212 --> 28:36.014
We got to give him a pass.

28:36.081 --> 28:38.116
<i>BILLY:</i>
<i>Auggie has a special place</i>
<i>in my heart</i>

28:38.183 --> 28:40.852
<i>because he was such dear friends</i>
<i>with my father.</i>

28:40.919 --> 28:42.120
-And this was his seat.
-This was his seat, and...

28:42.187 --> 28:43.121
That was his seat, and there was

28:43.188 --> 28:44.389
no one allowed in that seat.

28:44.456 --> 28:46.057
That's right. And what
if somebody was in here?

28:46.124 --> 28:48.193
-Oh, he's gone.
-That's right.

28:48.259 --> 28:50.495
-You got... Some box seats, man.
-Right out of there.

28:50.562 --> 28:53.331
And one of the lovely things
he did when my dad passed, man,

28:53.398 --> 28:55.133
they put a picture
of him here,

28:55.200 --> 28:57.869
-and everybody came in
and celebrated my father.
-ROB: Yeah.

28:57.936 --> 29:00.138
It's hard not to get choked up
thinking about it.

29:00.205 --> 29:02.273
I could see him
coming through the door, yeah.

29:02.340 --> 29:04.142
-ROB: When you told me
about Auggie...
-Right.

29:04.209 --> 29:06.111
...I actually called him, and

29:06.177 --> 29:08.146
-we set a little something up.
-Oh, you did?

29:08.213 --> 29:11.282
This is something that we wanted
to do to commemorate

29:11.349 --> 29:14.252
your dad and all the time
he spent here.

29:14.319 --> 29:17.122
And this is going
to stay right here in his spot.

29:17.188 --> 29:19.424
-Ah, come on.
-We're going
to put it here permanently.

29:19.491 --> 29:20.425
Well, thank you.

29:20.492 --> 29:21.526
<i>Rob and Auggie</i>

29:21.593 --> 29:24.496
found a-a circular plaque
that said,

<i>uh, "This seat dedicated</i>
<i>to William 'Corky' Gardell,</i>

29:29.234 --> 29:32.103

You're a good man.
Thank you, brother.

29:33.505 --> 29:35.006
-Yeah.
-Thank you. Rocco. I love you.

29:35.073 --> 29:36.441
ROB: I know how much
your dad meant to you, brother.

29:36.508 --> 29:38.543
Everything. That's, uh...

29:38.610 --> 29:40.411
That's...

29:40.478 --> 29:42.313
-That's beautiful.
Thank you guys.
-Absolutely.

29:42.380 --> 29:43.448
-Thank you from my heart,
thank you.
-Yeah.

29:43.515 --> 29:44.516
<i>It really touched me.</i>

29:44.582 --> 29:46.284
They broke me in half with that.
I started crying.

29:46.351 --> 29:49.420
He'll always have a spot here.

29:49.487 --> 29:52.257
-Your dad'll always be here.
-He's always here, man.

29:52.323 --> 29:53.791
-Thank you both so much.
-ROB: Yeah.

29:53.858 --> 29:55.460

<i>NISCHELLE: With our two weeks in</i>
<i>Pittsburgh coming to a close,</i>

30:09.240 --> 30:11.042
<i>most of the hard work is done.</i>

30:11.109 --> 30:12.310
<i>In the three-seasons room,</i>

30:12.377 --> 30:14.112
<i>Rob finished painting the door,</i>

<i>with the wallpaper, just in time</i>
<i>for the big reveal tomorrow.</i>

30:23.254 --> 30:25.023
All right, once this glue starts

30:25.089 --> 30:27.058
-getting a little tacky...
-Yeah.

30:27.125 --> 30:30.395
we got
to start laying down the paper.

30:32.130 --> 30:34.165
Billy and I have one more wall
to do, and I have to say,

30:34.232 --> 30:36.901
this is the most fun
I've ever had wallpapering.

30:36.968 --> 30:38.469
This looks like the glue

30:38.536 --> 30:40.205
I used to eat
when I was in school.

30:40.271 --> 30:42.340
-Me... I did, too. The paste?
-Right? Didn't you?

30:42.407 --> 30:44.576
-I loved it.
-Why did we want
to eat it so much?

30:44.642 --> 30:46.177
I don't know.
It's the same reason

30:46.244 --> 30:47.412
you smelled the copies
for the test.

30:47.478 --> 30:49.347
They used to run them
on a mimeograph,

30:49.414 --> 30:52.050
and everybody would grab
the paper going... (sniffling)

30:52.116 --> 30:54.586
-Why?
-I don't know. Because
it was the '70s, and inhaling

30:54.652 --> 30:58.289
-chemicals was okay back then,
I guess.
-(laughs)

30:58.356 --> 31:00.225

38:52.863 --> 38:54.532
And we were looking through
some of your old pictures.

38:54.598 --> 38:56.534
-Yeah.
-And she thought
that would be a nice touch

38:56.600 --> 38:59.036
-to have you and Jer
right on the nightstand there.
-Yeah.

38:59.103 --> 39:00.538
That's such a great picture,
of you guys,

39:00.604 --> 39:02.406
and she found
a great frame for it.

39:02.473 --> 39:03.808
Eyes are killing me.

39:03.874 --> 39:05.976
That's what
I was saying earlier.

39:06.043 --> 39:10.715
It's funny. Marianne scanned the
room immediately, and, you know,

39:10.781 --> 39:12.983
<i>there's a lot of details</i>
<i>that were changed, but</i>

39:13.050 --> 39:15.686
<i>the really sweet thing was</i>
<i>she noticed this picture</i>

39:15.753 --> 39:17.388
<i>that, uh, Sabrina</i>

39:17.455 --> 39:19.423
had found of her
and her late husband,

39:19.490 --> 39:21.125
and she put it on the...
the nightstand.

39:21.192 --> 39:23.561
We just wanted to give back.

39:25.629 --> 39:27.565
Picture was of my husband
and myself down

39:27.631 --> 39:30.401
<i>at Ocean City, Maryland, where</i>
<i>we used to go with the kids.</i>

39:30.468 --> 39:31.969
And then, you know, you see
that, and you just like,

39:32.036 --> 39:33.604
"Oh, my God,
I remember that picture,"

39:33.671 --> 39:35.072
and you're kind of, like, weepy.

39:35.139 --> 39:37.708
And I looked at Billy,
and we were just, like, crying,

39:37.775 --> 39:39.410
you know?

39:39.477 --> 39:43.714
So it was very emotional, along
with being just overwhelmed.

39:43.781 --> 39:45.549
It's a lot to take in.

39:45.616 --> 39:46.717
I think it made her heart swell,
which is...

39:46.784 --> 39:48.486
This is what this is about.

39:48.552 --> 39:49.854
-It's beautiful. Thank you.
-BILLY: Every bit.
-Do you...?

39:49.920 --> 39:51.122
-NISCHELLE: You love it.
-I do.

39:51.188 --> 39:53.758
-So pretty.
-And-and Rob got all the floors

39:53.824 --> 39:55.126
<i>uh, refinished</i>
<i>so that they've...</i>

39:55.192 --> 39:56.627
<i>they've got life in 'em again.</i>

39:56.694 --> 39:58.596
<i>MARIANNE:</i>
<i>It's so pretty.</i>

39:58.662 --> 40:00.865
BILLY: We got rid
of that '70s carpet, Mare.

40:00.931 --> 40:02.399
-You know? You're going
to be okay with that?
-Aw.

40:02.466 --> 40:04.568
-That's not coming back?
-No, that's not coming back.

40:04.635 --> 40:06.971
<i>BILLY:</i>
<i>When Marianne reacted</i>
<i>the way she did,</i>

40:07.037 --> 40:08.939
it just said everything.
You could just see

40:09.006 --> 40:11.108
how happy she was
with the renovation.

40:11.175 --> 40:12.877
-We made sure that this...
-Oh, my rocker!

40:12.943 --> 40:14.712
-And we had to make sure
the rocker's in there.
-Oh.

40:14.779 --> 40:17.648
And-and Rob put a-a finisher
on there just to freshen it up,

40:17.715 --> 40:20.117
-and the wood drank it in
very, very nicely.
-Oh, my God.

40:20.184 --> 40:22.086
We kept the rocking chair there

40:22.153 --> 40:24.021
because that's where she's
rocked all her grandbabies.

40:24.088 --> 40:26.757
He's told us all the wonderful
things you've done

40:26.824 --> 40:29.026
and just how you took him in
and treated him like a son.

40:29.093 --> 40:30.895
-I mean, come on.
-BILLY: She has.
-Hug Billy.

40:30.961 --> 40:33.731
-I have to hug Billy.
-I love you. I love you.

40:33.798 --> 40:34.899
<i>NISCHELLE:</i>
<i>I think it was overwhelming</i>

40:34.965 --> 40:37.168
for her, all of this
to take in in a day.

40:37.234 --> 40:40.471
That's beautiful.
She has really such good taste.

40:40.538 --> 40:41.939
But she is so happy,

40:42.006 --> 40:44.608
and that makes us
just incredibly happy.

40:44.675 --> 40:46.177
-Open the door for you.
-Thank you.

40:46.243 --> 40:47.745
-Let's go relax in your new
patio area.
-Go back outside.

40:47.812 --> 40:50.114
-Yes.
-What do you think?
-Hello! So?

40:50.181 --> 40:52.116
-Oh, this gang.
-Oh, nice.
-What did you think?

40:52.183 --> 40:53.884
Oh, it's beautiful. Great job.

40:53.951 --> 40:56.687
Upstairs is just
unbelievably...

40:56.754 --> 40:59.190
You have a whole new extension
of your house to enjoy.

40:59.256 --> 41:01.559
-I do. I need more family now.
-(laughter)

41:01.625 --> 41:02.927
NISCHELLE:
You got us now.

41:02.993 --> 41:06.197
I'll have to send out invites,
right?

41:06.263 --> 41:09.533
You really made an impact
on someone's life

41:09.600 --> 41:11.669
like you made on his life.

41:11.735 --> 41:14.038
You know,
what does that say to you?

41:14.104 --> 41:16.974
Billy came into our life
as Joe's friend,

41:17.041 --> 41:18.809
and then he became family,

41:18.876 --> 41:21.078
and then we've just been close.

41:21.145 --> 41:22.847
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

41:22.913 --> 41:24.849
<i>My husband--</i>

41:24.915 --> 41:26.217
he'd have been blown away.

41:26.283 --> 41:27.918
He'd have been shouting,
"Billy! Billy!

41:27.985 --> 41:29.220
I can't believe it. Billy."

41:29.286 --> 41:31.956
Yeah, they-they did
really like each other

41:32.022 --> 41:34.558
and had a good time together.
But he would have.

41:34.625 --> 41:36.660
He probably would have cried
like I did.

41:36.727 --> 41:39.663
After my husband died,
I went out to California

41:39.730 --> 41:41.932
and spent about nine
or ten Thanksgivings out there

41:41.999 --> 41:43.701
with Billy.
You just don't think about it,

41:43.767 --> 41:46.070
-you know?
It's just like family.
-Mm.

41:46.136 --> 41:48.205
-The most important thing
is family.
-Yeah. Yeah.

41:48.272 --> 41:49.974
I just want to express to you

41:50.040 --> 41:52.176
why you were the top choice
for this.

41:52.243 --> 41:55.246
It's because of who you are

41:55.312 --> 41:58.282
and the love that
you've shown me over the years

41:58.349 --> 42:00.851
and, uh, for giving me
my best friend.

42:00.918 --> 42:03.153
-Aw.
-So I love you. Thank you.

42:03.220 --> 42:04.622
<i>To be able to come</i>

42:04.688 --> 42:07.124
and give back was
an incredible opportunity,

42:07.191 --> 42:09.593
and I'm very grateful
for that.

42:09.660 --> 42:11.061
-I love you, Mare.
-I love you back.

42:11.128 --> 42:13.163
<i>-Salud,</i> everybody.
-Group hug. Group hug.

42:13.230 --> 42:14.765
-Group hug.
-Group hug. Then let's sit.

42:14.832 --> 42:16.233
<i>BILLY: Because she is</i>
<i>incredibly deserving</i>

42:16.300 --> 42:17.568
of something like this.

42:17.635 --> 42:18.903
NISCHELLE:
It's a perfect day.

42:18.969 --> 42:20.004
How 'bout this, Mare?

42:20.070 --> 42:21.171
-ROB: Oh, this is nice.
-Whoo-hoo!

42:21.238 --> 42:22.306
NISCHELLE:
It's a perfect day.

42:22.373 --> 42:24.742
-This is Pittsburgh weather.
-Right?

42:24.808 --> 42:25.843
<i>She was one of the people</i>
<i>in our corner</i>

42:25.910 --> 42:26.844
<i>saying, "You guys can do it."</i>

42:26.911 --> 42:28.012
<i>So to be able to bring</i>

42:28.078 --> 42:29.613
<i>this surprise renovation</i>

42:29.680 --> 42:31.749
back here for her
and gift her this

42:31.815 --> 42:33.751
is just a huge honor.

42:33.817 --> 42:35.152
-To Mare!
-To Mare. Cheers.

42:35.219 --> 42:36.020
BILLY:
To Mare.<i> Salud.</i>
