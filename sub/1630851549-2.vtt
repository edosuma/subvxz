No.I didn't realize

20:28.488 --> 20:30.577
NYPD had updated
their Patrol Guide

20:30.620 --> 20:33.275
with pages
from the Old Testament.

20:33.319 --> 20:35.146
I gave him a ride home.

20:35.190 --> 20:37.105
I think you should go home.

20:37.845 --> 20:38.846
Now.

20:55.384 --> 20:56.733
Anthony.

20:56.777 --> 20:59.040
You sound surprised to find me.

20:59.083 --> 21:00.737
In my own office.

21:00.781 --> 21:02.217
I was looking for you.

21:02.261 --> 21:04.437
Did you think I was hiding
under those papers?

21:04.480 --> 21:06.874
Don't be cute.
You're in trouble with me.

21:06.917 --> 21:08.179
You're snooping
through my stuff,

21:08.223 --> 21:09.790
and I'm in trouble with you?

21:09.833 --> 21:11.661
I wasn't snooping.Yeah, good racket you got.

21:11.705 --> 21:14.882
I was not snooping-- I was
looking for the Debernardo file.

21:14.925 --> 21:16.710
And that would be
in the file cabinet

21:16.753 --> 21:17.798
with all the other files.

21:19.016 --> 21:21.149
Well, if you were here
from time to time,

21:21.192 --> 21:23.934
I wouldn't have to go looking
for stuff by myself.

21:23.978 --> 21:25.501
I was gone less than an hour.

21:25.545 --> 21:27.286
Gone where?Personal time.

21:27.329 --> 21:29.679
Well, you're taking a lot
of that this week, aren't you?

21:29.723 --> 21:30.724
Every time I
come in here,

21:30.767 --> 21:31.899
you've gone somewhere

21:31.942 --> 21:33.379
doing God knows what.

21:33.422 --> 21:35.729
I was at my doctor
having a consultation

21:35.772 --> 21:37.600
about my upcoming colonoscopy.

21:37.644 --> 21:39.341
Should I tell him not to bother

21:39.385 --> 21:41.561
now that you're doing
the procedure?

21:41.604 --> 21:43.302
You think you're funny?

21:43.345 --> 21:45.347
I thought that one
wasn't half bad.

21:46.174 --> 21:48.568
You know what I think?
I think you're up to something,

21:48.611 --> 21:52.180
and I'm gonna find out
exactly what it is.

21:53.747 --> 21:55.270
DANNY:
I mean, honestly,

21:55.314 --> 21:57.185
she has no idea
how difficult it is

21:57.228 --> 21:58.926
for us to even make a case

21:58.969 --> 22:00.101
these days.

22:00.144 --> 22:01.842
We got both hands tied
behind our backs,

22:01.885 --> 22:03.887
and every bad guy in the city
knows it.

22:03.931 --> 22:05.585
Then she makes it out
like I'm the one

22:05.628 --> 22:07.456
who did something wrong--
can you believe that?

22:08.457 --> 22:09.937
Yeah, Danny, I can.

22:09.980 --> 22:11.286
W...And you know that--
that's why

22:11.330 --> 22:12.853
you keep asking me
to let you off the hook.

22:12.896 --> 22:14.811
But I didn't ask you
for anything.

22:14.855 --> 22:17.597
Then why do you keep saying
the same thing over and over

22:17.640 --> 22:19.555
and waiting for my response?

22:19.599 --> 22:20.600
Because she's annoying.

22:20.643 --> 22:22.079
I'm trying to let you know

22:22.123 --> 22:24.691
how ridiculous
my sister's being.

22:24.734 --> 22:26.257
She'sthe one being ridiculous?

22:26.301 --> 22:29.086
Okay, so what, you're
pissed off at me, too, now?

22:29.130 --> 22:30.914
What did I do wrong?

22:30.958 --> 22:32.176
I think you know.

22:32.220 --> 22:34.527
No, I don't know. Honestly.

22:34.570 --> 22:37.007
Well, you should.

22:41.011 --> 22:42.622
But you have to.

22:43.405 --> 22:47.017
Okay, maybe not have to,
but should do.

22:49.150 --> 22:51.239
Or at least
strongly consider doing.

22:51.282 --> 22:53.459
Delivering the statement.

22:53.502 --> 22:55.199
I considered it.

22:55.243 --> 22:57.332
Well, if it was me,
I'd just bite the bullet

22:57.376 --> 22:59.029
and talk the
talk and...

23:00.901 --> 23:03.338
But it's not me.

23:03.382 --> 23:04.731
No.

23:04.774 --> 23:06.820
It's him.

23:06.863 --> 23:09.344
And no matter what I say
or how I say it,

23:09.388 --> 23:11.477
it's gonna come out as:
"Dear Leader,

23:11.520 --> 23:14.001
who am I but a stone
in your shoe."

23:14.044 --> 23:15.176
That's nowhere in here.

23:15.219 --> 23:17.831
Doesn't matter.

23:17.874 --> 23:19.833
And I think he's bluffing.

23:19.876 --> 23:21.400
Can you see his cards?

23:21.443 --> 23:22.749
I know his tells.

23:22.792 --> 23:24.664
Can you see his cards?

23:24.707 --> 23:26.274
[sighs]

23:27.493 --> 23:28.885
No.

23:28.929 --> 23:30.496
No.

23:30.539 --> 23:34.151
And speaking as someone
who's 100% behind you in this,

23:34.195 --> 23:36.589
not showing up is gonna
be taken by everybody

23:36.632 --> 23:38.547
as you escalating it.

23:38.591 --> 23:40.549
Is that what you want?

23:45.424 --> 23:47.426
No.

23:52.518 --> 23:54.563
[sighs]

23:58.567 --> 24:01.483
[low, indistinct chatter][cameras clicking]

24:07.358 --> 24:10.187
Afternoon, everybody.

24:10.231 --> 24:12.929
I'll make this quick.

24:14.801 --> 24:17.238
[sighs]:
I have a...

24:17.281 --> 24:20.023
statement regarding
the arrest my detail made

24:20.067 --> 24:23.897
on a quality-of-life misdemeanor
the other day

24:23.940 --> 24:28.336
and, uh, my part... in it.

24:30.381 --> 24:32.471
When you've been
a police officer

24:32.514 --> 24:37.040
as long as I was,
you can't help but react

24:37.084 --> 24:41.088
when you come upon a crime
in progress.

24:41.828 --> 24:43.917
However...

24:43.960 --> 24:49.575
that instinct
has to be tempered...

24:49.618 --> 24:51.228
by...

24:56.973 --> 25:00.673
Actually, my statement's
in the form...

25:00.716 --> 25:02.326
of a question.

25:02.370 --> 25:04.590
Who wants to live in a city

25:04.633 --> 25:07.549
where the police commissioner
comes upon a crime,

25:07.593 --> 25:09.638
in progress,

25:09.682 --> 25:12.119
and just keeps driving?

25:13.163 --> 25:15.557
What's the message there?

25:15.601 --> 25:19.169
[reporters shouting]

25:29.876 --> 25:31.573
Can I help you?

25:31.617 --> 25:33.357
Henry, it's me.

25:33.401 --> 25:34.620
Anthony.

25:34.663 --> 25:35.969
Abetamarco.

25:36.012 --> 25:37.187
I used to work for you,
remember?

25:37.231 --> 25:38.754
Doesn't ring a bell.

25:44.412 --> 25:45.935
A little senior citizen humor.

25:45.979 --> 25:48.982
Ah, you got me pretty good
there, I'll tell you.

25:49.025 --> 25:51.724
Then you're losing
a step, Detective.

25:51.767 --> 25:53.900
Look, I don't want to take
up too much of your time.

25:53.943 --> 25:57.077
Mets game doesn't start
for three hours. We're good.

25:57.120 --> 25:58.600
Okay, full disclosure.

25:58.644 --> 26:00.733
I've already approached
Danny and Jamie with this.

26:00.776 --> 26:02.256
They both sent me packing.

26:02.299 --> 26:03.605
So this is about Erin?

26:03.649 --> 26:05.868
You want to approach her
about something,

26:05.912 --> 26:07.304
but you don't know how?

26:07.348 --> 26:08.654
Yeah.Far as I can tell,

26:08.697 --> 26:11.657
nobody knows her these days
better than you.

26:11.700 --> 26:12.875
Fair point.

26:12.919 --> 26:14.834
But this is bigger
than just her and me.

26:14.877 --> 26:16.096
How big?

26:27.586 --> 26:29.370
Aha.

26:31.981 --> 26:33.069
I'll make the call.

26:33.113 --> 26:34.114
But not to Erin?

26:34.157 --> 26:35.202
No.

26:35.245 --> 26:37.726
To the one you came to me for.

26:42.339 --> 26:43.689
[footsteps approaching]

26:45.038 --> 26:46.822
[sighs]

26:49.695 --> 26:51.435
You were right.

26:52.393 --> 26:55.744
I'm sorry, can you
say that again so I can get it

26:55.788 --> 26:58.573
on video?Okay, enough.

26:58.617 --> 27:02.359
I admit it, I was...
[takes deep breath]

27:02.403 --> 27:04.448
[clears throat]Okay, Fonzi, spit it out.

27:04.492 --> 27:05.711
I...

27:05.754 --> 27:07.669
wasn't right.

27:07.713 --> 27:09.236
You were right.

27:09.279 --> 27:10.890
About what?

27:11.673 --> 27:13.719
You were right to be pissed off

27:13.762 --> 27:16.939
that I went out as a decoy
without backup.

27:17.723 --> 27:20.726
We're all struggling
with the new way of the world.

27:20.769 --> 27:23.250
We can't do things
the way we used to.

27:23.293 --> 27:25.600
I mean, it's frustrating,
I know,

27:25.644 --> 27:28.690
but it doesn't mean
you go it alone.

27:28.734 --> 27:31.388
I know. And I know
we've been over this before.

27:31.432 --> 27:33.652
It's just very difficult
to sit on my hands

27:33.695 --> 27:35.654
when there's a 14-year-old
in the hospital,

27:35.697 --> 27:37.743
and we can't nail
the sons of bitches who did it

27:37.786 --> 27:40.441
because they got everybody
running scared.

27:40.484 --> 27:41.921
Yeah, I'm with you on that one.

27:41.964 --> 27:43.923
But it doesn't mean
you go crashing through

27:43.966 --> 27:46.403
every rule and procedure
like the old days.

27:46.447 --> 27:48.405
You've still got to do it
by the book.

27:48.449 --> 27:50.843
Sometimes the book
doesn't get the job done,

27:50.886 --> 27:52.801
and that really sucks.

27:53.584 --> 27:56.849
It's like jujitsu--
instead of working

27:56.892 --> 27:59.068
against the book,
we make the book work for us.

27:59.112 --> 28:00.504
Well, how do we do that?

28:00.548 --> 28:02.985
Yeah, I spoke to a friend
of mine in the gang unit,

28:03.029 --> 28:04.770
and I told him about the case.

28:04.813 --> 28:07.250
And he showed me
some of the photos

28:07.294 --> 28:09.513
of the gang we're after.

28:11.559 --> 28:13.430
Hmm.

28:14.344 --> 28:16.520
No way.

28:23.353 --> 28:25.921
Yeah, that's Ricky, all right.

28:25.965 --> 28:28.184
Is Ricky part of your gang?

28:29.533 --> 28:31.231
Come on,
is he or isn't he?

28:31.274 --> 28:33.668
You forgetting something,
Detective?

28:34.843 --> 28:37.585
I'm sorry
for what happened to you.

28:39.021 --> 28:42.764
I shouldn't have dropped you off
into a situation like that.

28:42.808 --> 28:44.287
Sorry.

28:47.160 --> 28:48.770
We're good.

28:48.814 --> 28:50.337
That's the game.

28:50.380 --> 28:52.252
[softly]:
Well...

28:53.296 --> 28:54.820
Now that we're all friends,

28:54.863 --> 28:56.909
can you tell us
if Ricky's part of your crew?

28:56.952 --> 28:58.780
Think I want
my other nose broken?

28:58.824 --> 29:00.956
We already know
Ricky runs with you.

29:01.000 --> 29:03.350
The real question is,
why would Ricky let his own crew

29:03.393 --> 29:05.004
take out his brother?

29:05.047 --> 29:06.832
That ain't how it went down.

29:06.875 --> 29:08.572
Well, how did it go down?

29:10.052 --> 29:14.622
Seeing as I can't ever show
my face again in the hood...

29:14.665 --> 29:17.843
and we've gathered here
all friendly like...

29:17.886 --> 29:20.628
shouldn't we start talking
about a deal,

29:20.671 --> 29:24.327
Madam Assistant
District Attorney?

29:27.896 --> 29:29.376
[fans cheering on TV]

29:29.419 --> 29:31.030
EDDIE:
I'll be quick.

29:31.073 --> 29:33.206
Couple hours.

29:33.249 --> 29:35.382
SoulCycle takes two hours?

29:35.425 --> 29:37.079
I got to get there, change,

29:37.123 --> 29:39.168
and then come back.

29:39.212 --> 29:41.954
All right, have fun.
Don't forget your cycling shoes.

29:41.997 --> 29:43.520
Right.

30:01.625 --> 30:04.498
[footsteps approaching]

30:06.282 --> 30:08.458
[sighs]

30:09.546 --> 30:11.635
Okay. I'm outie.

30:13.159 --> 30:14.551
What?

30:15.291 --> 30:16.989
Work out tomorrow. Stay.

30:17.032 --> 30:18.817
Watch a movie with me.

30:19.600 --> 30:21.515
Just pick something good.

30:21.558 --> 30:23.647
We'll watch when I get home.

30:27.826 --> 30:30.176
GORMLEY:
Boss, these are crazy times.

30:30.219 --> 30:32.395
We all feel that.

30:32.439 --> 30:34.397
Which is why,
now more than ever,

30:34.441 --> 30:36.095
we need to hold steady.

30:36.138 --> 30:38.358
Need youto hold steady.

30:40.447 --> 30:42.449
Never steadier.

30:42.492 --> 30:45.017
Do you really want to risk
losing the war

30:45.060 --> 30:46.801
just to win a bar fight?

30:46.845 --> 30:48.498
That's not what I'm doing.This plays

30:48.542 --> 30:50.370
a lot like two rams
who've locked horns

30:50.413 --> 30:52.372
and are having a hard time
unlocking.

30:52.415 --> 30:53.895
Yeah, I've seen those videos.

30:53.939 --> 30:56.811
One of them has to bow down
and twist his neck.

30:56.855 --> 30:58.900
Not gonna be me.

30:58.944 --> 31:00.032
[chuckles softly]

31:00.075 --> 31:02.251
You have an answer
for everything.

31:02.295 --> 31:03.470
I give up. I really do.

31:03.513 --> 31:05.515
Garrett, it isn't pride.

31:05.559 --> 31:07.474
It isn't ego.

31:07.517 --> 31:09.824
If our cops second-guessed
every move

31:09.868 --> 31:12.087
the way they're asking me to,

31:12.131 --> 31:14.960
we'd be attending a funeral
every week.

31:15.003 --> 31:16.700
Yes,

31:16.744 --> 31:18.964
but you're not a cop;
you're their leader.

31:19.007 --> 31:19.834
All the more reason.

31:19.878 --> 31:21.618
To deescalate the situation.

31:21.662 --> 31:24.143
To lead by that example.That woman

31:24.186 --> 31:26.145
was genuinely afraid.

31:26.188 --> 31:28.799
She had Maryland plates--
she was probably just visiting

31:28.843 --> 31:31.454
or passing through--
and she had no idea

31:31.498 --> 31:33.979
what that guy
might be capable of.

31:34.022 --> 31:34.980
Look, I get that...

31:35.023 --> 31:36.329
So we deescalated.

31:36.372 --> 31:38.244
We stepped in.
We made the arrest.
