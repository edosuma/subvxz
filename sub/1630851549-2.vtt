WEBVTT

00:07.920 --> 00:10.140
So that's that?
We're dropping it?

00:10.184 --> 00:12.055
The D.A. says drop it,
so we drop it.

00:12.099 --> 00:14.362
All of a sudden we're
by-the-book boneheads?

00:14.405 --> 00:16.494
By-the-book boneheads?

00:16.538 --> 00:19.193
I don't know, it just came
out. You get my point.

00:19.236 --> 00:21.891
Look, I'm already in the
doghouse with Crawford, okay?

00:21.934 --> 00:23.588
So she says don't touch it...

00:23.632 --> 00:24.937
So what?
Touch it anyway.

00:24.981 --> 00:26.678
Wow, in this day and age,

00:26.722 --> 00:29.072
advising me to
inappropriately touch.

00:29.116 --> 00:30.595
Come on, you know what
I'm saying.

00:30.639 --> 00:32.293
We've done this
many times before.

00:32.336 --> 00:35.948
Okay, not this time,
not with this D.A., not now.

00:35.992 --> 00:39.213
You keep saying this stuff.
What makes you so sure?

00:39.256 --> 00:41.171
My gut instinct.

00:41.215 --> 00:45.001
Oh, yes. "And on the eighth day,
God created

00:45.045 --> 00:47.395
the Reagan gut instinct."
Give me a break.

00:47.438 --> 00:49.223
You think I'm making excuses?

00:49.266 --> 00:51.051
And Bingo was his name-o.

00:51.094 --> 00:52.182
Why would I do that?

00:52.226 --> 00:54.010
'Cause you're scared of her.Really?

00:54.054 --> 00:56.056
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
[whimpering]

00:56.099 --> 00:58.754
You're really not pulling
any punches today, are you?

00:58.797 --> 01:00.538
I've been pulling punches
for months,

01:00.582 --> 01:01.844
and I'm sick and tired of it.

01:01.887 --> 01:03.106
We're not touching it,
end of story.

01:03.150 --> 01:04.281
Where are you going?

01:04.325 --> 01:05.804
Back to my office
to dot my i's

01:05.848 --> 01:07.806
and cross my t's
like a good little

01:07.850 --> 01:08.981
by-the-book bonehead.

01:09.025 --> 01:10.200
We're in the middle of a fight.

01:10.244 --> 01:11.810
You can't walk out.

01:11.854 --> 01:13.812
Don't got no fight
left in me, sweetheart.

01:13.856 --> 01:17.947
For the love of God, that means
you have fight left.

01:17.990 --> 01:19.079
[sighs]

01:21.124 --> 01:22.169
So, is it true?

01:22.212 --> 01:23.909
Of course it's true.

01:23.953 --> 01:26.390
But can you be absolutely
certain that it's true?

01:26.434 --> 01:29.132
I feel like we're having this
conversation in quicksand.

01:29.176 --> 01:31.743
Well, how would you feel
without that thought?

01:31.787 --> 01:33.963
That it's absolutely true.

01:34.006 --> 01:35.834
What are you talking about?

01:35.878 --> 01:37.488
Come on, just answer
the question.

01:37.532 --> 01:38.446
Danny, stop.

01:38.489 --> 01:39.534
No, just answer it.

01:39.577 --> 01:40.926
No, I mean Danny, stop!

01:42.145 --> 01:43.581
[tires screeching]

01:51.937 --> 01:53.461
He's alive.Calling a bus.

01:53.504 --> 01:55.854
No, no time.
Get the door.

02:03.079 --> 02:05.995
[tires screech][siren wailing]

02:10.391 --> 02:11.783
Excuse me. Sergeant Reagan.

02:11.827 --> 02:13.176
I just got a call that
my wife was rushed here.

02:13.220 --> 02:15.178
Yes, right around the corner,
room 119.

02:15.222 --> 02:16.484
Thank you.

02:16.527 --> 02:19.095
Sarge, everything's okay.
Your wife is fine.

02:19.139 --> 02:22.011
Doctors wanted to make sure
it was just a sprain.What happened?

02:22.054 --> 02:23.621
She twisted her ankle
chasing down a perp.

02:23.665 --> 02:25.057
She was off-duty.

02:25.101 --> 02:27.364
Apparently she saw a guy
snatch a woman's purse,

02:27.408 --> 02:29.714
took off after him.In those?

02:29.758 --> 02:31.368
Pretty sure these were
responsible

02:31.412 --> 02:32.500
for the twisted ankle.

02:32.543 --> 02:33.544
All right. But she's fine?

02:33.588 --> 02:34.676
Barely a scratch.

02:34.719 --> 02:38.158
Thank you.
I appreciate it.

02:38.201 --> 02:39.985
Um...

02:40.029 --> 02:41.509
how come you guys brought her
all the way downtown?

02:41.552 --> 02:43.206
Happened a couple blocks
from here.

02:45.730 --> 02:47.950
Thank you.

02:50.735 --> 02:53.216
Your mind races
after things like this,

02:53.260 --> 02:56.088
and I keep coming back
to the same thought.

02:56.132 --> 02:58.917
If you guys didn't
show up when you did...

02:58.961 --> 03:00.223
Thankfully, we did.

03:00.267 --> 03:04.314
Yeah, but if you didn't,
Matthew wouldn't be here.

03:05.968 --> 03:08.927
We were in the right place
at the right time for a reason.

03:08.971 --> 03:10.625
You sure were.

03:10.668 --> 03:13.193
Look, I'll be honest with you,

03:13.236 --> 03:15.456
I've never really had a nice
thing to say about the police.

03:15.499 --> 03:19.634
But you saved baby bro's life.

03:20.635 --> 03:22.898
There's nothing bigger
than that.

03:22.941 --> 03:24.552
Just doing our job.

03:24.595 --> 03:26.293
I wish there was some way
I could repay you.

03:26.336 --> 03:28.947
Well, the best way
that you can help us

03:28.991 --> 03:31.036
is to tell us
who did this to you.

03:31.080 --> 03:32.560
I wish I could.

03:32.603 --> 03:34.126
There's nothing I want more
than to catch

03:34.170 --> 03:35.693
the guys who did this,

03:35.737 --> 03:37.869
but I just don't
remember anything.

03:37.913 --> 03:40.132
The doctors think
he blacked out.

03:40.176 --> 03:42.439
Any little bit helps.

03:42.483 --> 03:44.963
I'm sorry, there's
nothing there.

03:45.007 --> 03:46.617
You say you want to
catch the guys

03:46.661 --> 03:48.880
who did this to you?Yeah, of course.

03:48.924 --> 03:50.882
Do you remember how many
there were,

03:50.926 --> 03:52.667
since you said it was guys?

03:52.710 --> 03:56.627
Um... I'm not sure.

03:56.671 --> 03:59.326
More than three?Maybe. I don't know.

03:59.369 --> 04:01.502
Anyone familiar among them?

04:01.545 --> 04:03.460
Someone from the neighborhood?

04:03.504 --> 04:05.593
I didn't see any faces.

04:05.636 --> 04:08.726
Just a lot of bodies
out of nowhere.

04:08.770 --> 04:11.860
So they came at you
from behind?

04:11.903 --> 04:13.862
No, uh...

04:15.124 --> 04:16.386
I don't know.

04:16.430 --> 04:19.041
Look, we...
we know this happens a lot

04:19.084 --> 04:20.564
in the neighborhood.

04:20.608 --> 04:22.914
There's a crew running around
doing this to people

04:22.958 --> 04:25.177
three and four times a week.

04:25.221 --> 04:28.442
You're probably afraid
of retaliation; we get it.

04:28.485 --> 04:31.967
But until somebody
steps up to stop these guys,

04:32.010 --> 04:34.056
it's just gonna keep happening.

04:34.099 --> 04:37.189
They left you for dead, Matthew.

04:37.233 --> 04:39.191
Maybe the next person
won't be so lucky.

04:39.235 --> 04:41.368
We may not be in the
right place at the right time

04:41.411 --> 04:43.283
the next time this happens.

04:44.371 --> 04:47.939
I hear what you're saying.
I'll tell you what...

04:53.945 --> 04:57.819
Let the kid get
some rest, okay?

04:57.862 --> 04:59.951
I'll talk to him.

05:01.605 --> 05:02.954
Okay.

05:07.045 --> 05:08.351
[horns honking][people shouting]

05:08.395 --> 05:10.005
MAN: I gotta go to work!What's going on?

05:10.048 --> 05:12.660
WOMAN: Hey, you in the truck!
Move it, already. Move!

05:12.703 --> 05:14.183
Come on!

05:15.967 --> 05:17.578
I said no, thank you!

05:17.621 --> 05:20.276
Too bad about you, lady.
I already did it, now pay up.

05:20.320 --> 05:21.582
I'm not paying you.

05:21.625 --> 05:24.411
What'd you say? Huh?Get away from me.

05:24.454 --> 05:26.978
Hey! Get away!
What are you doing, you psycho?

05:27.022 --> 05:29.590
Get away from my car.
Get away.

05:29.633 --> 05:31.243
Get away from my car!Give me my money!

05:31.287 --> 05:32.462
Get away from my car!Where you going, huh?

05:32.506 --> 05:33.811
Get away!You can't go anywhere.

05:33.855 --> 05:35.639
Come on!Psycho!

05:35.683 --> 05:37.380
Hey. Police!

05:37.424 --> 05:39.600
You're under arrest.
Turn around.

05:39.643 --> 05:41.341
I didn't do nothin'.Put your hands behind your back.

05:41.384 --> 05:43.125
I was just cleaning
her car, man.

05:43.168 --> 05:44.996
NUCIFORO:
You all right, ma'am?

05:48.130 --> 05:51.351
â™ª

06:11.458 --> 06:13.242
Gotta be honest with you, boss.

06:13.285 --> 06:15.549
When I saw the video of
your detail cuffing him,

06:15.592 --> 06:17.289
ear-to-ear grin.

06:17.333 --> 06:18.465
Thank you.

06:18.508 --> 06:20.336
Millions of people
watched it also,

06:20.380 --> 06:21.772
not all of them grinning.

06:21.816 --> 06:23.557
Long time coming, boss.
The people are happy

06:23.600 --> 06:24.775
somebody's finally
standing up

06:24.819 --> 06:26.690
and saying enough is enough.

06:26.734 --> 06:28.344
I wouldn't count the mayor
among those people.

06:28.388 --> 06:31.173
What the squeegee guy did
was illegal.

06:31.216 --> 06:32.130
What the boss did

06:32.174 --> 06:33.741
was completely
on the up-and-up.

06:33.784 --> 06:35.960
Rank and file's
gonna love it, too.

06:36.004 --> 06:39.616
The mayor, however, will see it
as a personal insult.

06:41.618 --> 06:44.316
So you're saying
I did it intentionally

06:44.360 --> 06:45.579
just to piss him off?

06:46.318 --> 06:48.451
No. I think
you had the guy collared

06:48.495 --> 06:51.367
because you legitimately thought
it was the right thing to do.

06:52.324 --> 06:54.936
I also think that about
halfway through the whole thing

06:54.979 --> 06:57.634
it occurred to you how
this would play with the mayor,

06:57.678 --> 07:00.158
and decided to go through
with it anyway.Don't be ridiculous.

07:00.202 --> 07:02.639
Nobody thinks of
that much stuff

07:02.683 --> 07:03.814
in the heat of the moment.

07:03.858 --> 07:06.034
Have it your way,
but probably best

07:06.077 --> 07:08.602
to reach out to the mayor
before he reaches out to you.

07:08.645 --> 07:10.995
Reach out for what?

07:11.039 --> 07:14.738
Well, to apologize for
any imagined slight.

07:15.913 --> 07:19.308
I can't apologize
for something he imagined.

07:19.351 --> 07:21.789
Yeah, I could have stayed
in the car.

07:21.832 --> 07:23.181
But I felt it was important

07:23.225 --> 07:25.009
the rank and file see
who gave the order.

07:25.053 --> 07:27.751
And why not?
That kind of harassment

07:27.795 --> 07:29.231
is a quality-of-life issue.

07:29.274 --> 07:31.276
And you know what,
sometimes it's good

07:31.320 --> 07:33.104
to show who's boss.

07:35.019 --> 07:38.022
You've been summoned.

07:42.374 --> 07:45.943
You know, the mayor in Jaws
wasn't the hero of that movie.

07:47.554 --> 07:49.686
Something to think about.

07:49.730 --> 07:52.733
[siren wails]

07:53.690 --> 07:55.083
[loud knock]Oh!

07:55.126 --> 07:57.825
Hey, you.Hey, Jamie, oh...

07:57.868 --> 07:59.827
What are you,
sneaking up on me?

07:59.870 --> 08:01.568
Didn't mean to scare you.
Just saying hi.

08:01.611 --> 08:03.526
[chuckles]
Hi.

08:03.570 --> 08:05.049
How's the ankle?

08:05.093 --> 08:07.530
Fit as a fiddle,
like nothing ever happened.

08:07.574 --> 08:09.184
Everything okay?

08:09.227 --> 08:11.882
Oh, yeah.
Just paperwork, you know.

08:11.926 --> 08:13.362
Everything okay with you?

08:13.405 --> 08:15.016
Yeah.

08:15.059 --> 08:19.760
Well, something, um, actually
is kind of on my mind.

08:19.803 --> 08:21.849
Oh?Excuse me, Sarge.

08:26.244 --> 08:28.029
Last night when I
picked you up at the hospital,

08:28.072 --> 08:29.204
we were all the way downtown.

08:29.247 --> 08:30.988
Yeah, that's where they took me.

08:31.032 --> 08:32.468
Right, but you said you were
going out with your girlfriends

08:32.512 --> 08:33.513
on the Upper East Side.

08:33.556 --> 08:34.862
I have no idea why

08:34.905 --> 08:36.385
they took me there, Jamie.

08:36.428 --> 08:39.606
You'd have to ask them.Yeah. Right.

08:39.649 --> 08:40.868
I'm sure it's nothing.

08:40.911 --> 08:43.958
Um... I'll let you
get back to it.

08:54.534 --> 08:56.144
Hey!

08:56.187 --> 08:57.841
Look what the fat
dragged in.

08:57.885 --> 08:59.713
Danny!I meant cat.

08:59.756 --> 09:01.323
That's all right, Baez.

09:01.366 --> 09:03.891
I used to Reagan's insecurities
getting the best of him.

09:03.934 --> 09:05.893
I try to be the bigger man.

09:05.936 --> 09:08.591
You most certainly are
the larger man.

09:08.635 --> 09:09.853
You're right.

09:09.897 --> 09:12.552
And you're much, much thinner.Hey!

09:12.595 --> 09:13.901
You know, we're trying
to work here.

09:13.944 --> 09:15.598
What is it that you want,
anyway?

09:15.642 --> 09:18.775
A word in private,
if you don't mind, Detective.

09:20.777 --> 09:22.344
You're not gonna
eat me, are you?

09:22.387 --> 09:23.693
Seriously?

09:23.737 --> 09:25.173
Come on.

09:27.871 --> 09:30.744
Step right here
into my office.

09:30.787 --> 09:32.746
What can I do you for?

09:32.789 --> 09:34.617
I need your help
with something.

09:34.661 --> 09:35.879
Okay, what is it?

09:35.923 --> 09:37.315
I got something
serious to say,

09:37.359 --> 09:39.056
and I don't know how
to say it.

09:39.100 --> 09:41.493
Has to do with your sister.

09:41.537 --> 09:44.192
Okay, I'm listening.

09:51.808 --> 09:53.897
What am I supposed
to do with this?

09:53.941 --> 09:55.986
Tell me what you think.

09:57.640 --> 10:00.469
I think I'm gonna pretend
I never saw it.

10:04.691 --> 10:06.344
Hey.

10:06.388 --> 10:08.129
Hope you're here
with some good news.

10:08.172 --> 10:10.958
Sorry, Matthew doesn't
remember anything.

10:11.001 --> 10:13.961
Come on, it sure seemed like
he wanted to tell us something.

10:14.004 --> 10:16.659
Look, sorry, guys,
he's just not comfortable, okay?

10:16.703 --> 10:19.009
But I appreciate everything
you guys did for him.

10:20.315 --> 10:21.316
And I wanted you
to hear it from me.

10:21.359 --> 10:24.362
That's it? He won't reconsider?

10:26.016 --> 10:27.844
Take it easy, guys.Uh-huh.

10:27.888 --> 10:30.194
Take it easy.

10:30.238 --> 10:31.848
What now?

10:33.589 --> 10:34.982
[sighs]

10:38.028 --> 10:40.161
[loud rock music playing]DANNY: Pardon me.

10:40.204 --> 10:43.947
Sorry. Sorry.Oh!

10:43.991 --> 10:45.688
[laughs]: Whoa.Pardon me. Sorry.

10:45.732 --> 10:47.690
See you tomorrow.

10:47.734 --> 10:49.213
[exhales]

10:51.041 --> 10:53.087
Look at this scrub, man.

10:53.130 --> 10:54.958
Look like a lick to me.[laughter]

10:55.002 --> 10:56.568
Oh, stumbling!Yo, hard day at work?

10:56.612 --> 10:58.048
[chuckling]

10:58.092 --> 10:59.528
Hey, man, I know you got
something for me.Easy.

10:59.571 --> 11:01.008
Hit him, man.
Get him!

11:01.051 --> 11:02.966
[grunting]

11:04.098 --> 11:05.055
Come on, man,
let's go!

11:05.099 --> 11:06.100
Let's go, let's go!

11:06.143 --> 11:08.189
Police! Hey!This a cop?!

11:08.232 --> 11:09.930
Sobering news, ain't it?

11:09.973 --> 11:10.757
Hell nah!

11:16.806 --> 11:28.949
â™ª

11:28.992 --> 11:30.777
Sorry to keep you waiting,
Commissioner.

11:30.820 --> 11:32.604
You always keep me waiting.

11:32.648 --> 11:34.476
Is that some kind
of psych-out thing

11:34.519 --> 11:35.869
they taught you
in business school?

11:35.912 --> 11:38.175
You think I kept you waiting
as a tactic?

11:38.219 --> 11:39.873
Sure do.

11:39.916 --> 11:42.092
Well, I can see we're
getting this meeting off

11:42.136 --> 11:43.180
on the right foot.

11:43.224 --> 11:44.486
Well, wedidn't twiddle

11:44.529 --> 11:45.705
our thumbs for ten minutes.

11:45.748 --> 11:46.967
I did.

11:47.924 --> 11:51.058
You arrested that squeegee guy
in broad daylight

11:51.101 --> 11:53.538
to show me up.

11:53.582 --> 11:55.671
My detail arrested that man.

11:55.715 --> 11:56.803
Under your orders.

11:56.846 --> 11:57.934
Because he grew violent

11:57.978 --> 11:59.283
and posed an immediate threat.

11:59.327 --> 12:00.937
And the reason you got out
of your vehicle?

12:00.981 --> 12:03.897
In the event my detail needed
backup; standard procedure.

12:03.940 --> 12:06.247
More like you knew
every phone would be out

12:06.290 --> 12:07.552
and recording it,

12:07.596 --> 12:08.945
and you wanted to get
your close-up.

12:08.989 --> 12:12.601
You think I wanted to
create a media frenzy?

12:12.644 --> 12:14.777
Sure do.

12:16.387 --> 12:17.911
Is there a point
to this meeting?

12:17.954 --> 12:21.523
Apologize for the grandstanding.

12:21.566 --> 12:23.525
Read a statement to the press.

12:23.568 --> 12:26.267
Have Garrett write something up.

12:26.310 --> 12:27.703
I wasn't grandstanding.

12:27.747 --> 12:29.400
I'll even give you
some benefit of the doubt.

12:29.444 --> 12:31.315
Garrett can write that
you couldn't have seen

12:31.359 --> 12:33.927
the effects of your action
in the moment,

12:33.970 --> 12:36.538
but you now recognize
the perception was

12:36.581 --> 12:39.019
you were making
some kind of point.

12:39.062 --> 12:42.762
So... grandstanding.

12:42.805 --> 12:46.940
I'm sure Garrett has some more
neutral word he can use.

12:46.983 --> 12:48.637
For me to mealy mouth?

12:48.680 --> 12:51.509
For you to deliver with all
the force and certainty

12:51.553 --> 12:53.381
you are famous for.

12:56.340 --> 12:59.691
At any place of business
anywhere in this world,

12:59.735 --> 13:02.303
if your boss thinks
you made him look bad,

13:02.346 --> 13:04.740
you apologize and you fix it.

13:04.784 --> 13:07.917
And you're damn grateful
to be given the opportunity.

13:10.354 --> 13:13.183
That is all, Commissioner.

13:16.099 --> 13:18.188
[sighing]

13:20.843 --> 13:24.368
One, two, three,

13:24.412 --> 13:26.980
four, five,

13:27.023 --> 13:29.721
six.

13:29.765 --> 13:32.594
And that's just
in the last month, Ozzie.

13:32.637 --> 13:35.597
I don't know any
of these people.

13:35.640 --> 13:37.164
And I don't know what
you're talking about.

13:37.207 --> 13:39.427
Yes, you do.

13:39.470 --> 13:42.430
Look, I understand you think
it's very unlucky

13:42.473 --> 13:44.867
that you were the first person
that I caught.

13:44.911 --> 13:47.827
But in fact, it makes you
the lucky one.

13:47.870 --> 13:49.698
Because you get first crack
at making a deal.

13:49.741 --> 13:53.658
So give me the names
of the guys that were with you.

13:53.702 --> 13:55.660
No deal.

13:57.401 --> 13:59.012
You know, I understand.

13:59.055 --> 14:02.363
The city's turned upside down
on its head.

14:02.406 --> 14:03.886
We can't jump on every crime.
You know that.

14:03.930 --> 14:06.497
So why wouldn't you
take advantage, right?

14:06.541 --> 14:08.064
I got nothing to say to you.

14:08.108 --> 14:09.544
I caught you red-handed,

14:09.587 --> 14:11.502
and I got you for
attempted robbery and assault.

14:11.546 --> 14:12.852
Both felonies.

14:12.895 --> 14:14.592
If that was enough to put
any time on me,

14:14.636 --> 14:15.767
we wouldn't be talking.

14:15.811 --> 14:17.595
I'd be on the back
of the bus

14:17.639 --> 14:20.903
on my way to Rikers.
But we are talking.

14:20.947 --> 14:23.993
Astute point, but the thing is,
what's gonna happen

14:24.037 --> 14:25.386
when I put you in a lineup,

14:25.429 --> 14:27.779
and I parade a bunch
of people through,

14:27.823 --> 14:29.607
and they all point
the finger at you?

14:29.651 --> 14:31.958
You got a better chance of
attempted robbery and assault

14:32.001 --> 14:33.916
than any of these people
pointing fingers.

14:33.960 --> 14:36.397
And that's because they're
afraid of you and your crew?

14:36.440 --> 14:38.399
'Cause they live in
the real world.

14:38.442 --> 14:39.487
A place you should visit.

14:39.530 --> 14:42.229
Last chance.

14:42.272 --> 14:44.274
Names?

14:45.580 --> 14:47.408
Do what you gotta do.

14:47.451 --> 14:49.323
I'll be back home by dinner.

14:49.366 --> 14:51.412
You know, you're right again.

14:51.455 --> 14:53.414
You will be home by dinner.

14:53.457 --> 14:56.896
In fact... you're free
to go right now.

14:56.939 --> 14:58.941
Seriously?
Yes!

14:58.985 --> 15:01.770
In fact, why don't I
give you a ride home.

15:01.813 --> 15:03.815
Oh. We out.

15:07.210 --> 15:10.300
Actually, I think I'm good.

15:10.344 --> 15:13.913
Oh, no, I insist.

15:19.744 --> 15:21.877
Don't do this, man. Please.

15:21.921 --> 15:23.444
I thought you'd appreciate
a ride home.

15:23.487 --> 15:24.836
My crew sees me getting
out of your car,

15:24.880 --> 15:26.534
you know what
they gonna think.

15:26.577 --> 15:28.231
They're gonna think
I'm a courteous individual.

15:28.275 --> 15:30.799
Come on, man, quit playing.
They're gonna think I snitched.

15:30.842 --> 15:32.322
What does your crew do
to snitches?

15:32.366 --> 15:34.324
Please!

15:35.499 --> 15:38.111
Let's... let's work
something out.

15:38.154 --> 15:40.983
You already know what I want.Anything but that.

15:41.027 --> 15:43.420
Look, either you snitch,
or you look like a snitch.

15:43.464 --> 15:44.813
Either way I lose.

15:44.856 --> 15:47.381
Well, that's why they say
crime doesn't pay.

15:49.165 --> 15:51.080
[hip-hop music playing faintly]

15:51.124 --> 15:53.822
â™ª

15:56.346 --> 15:58.479
Oh, come on, man.
They're right there.

15:58.522 --> 16:00.176
DANNY:
I see 'em.

16:00.220 --> 16:02.831
Last chance.

16:02.874 --> 16:04.441
I can't.

16:04.485 --> 16:05.660
You know I can't.

16:05.703 --> 16:08.358
Thank you for driving with us.

16:09.098 --> 16:10.970
I'll get your door.

16:11.013 --> 16:14.886
What's up with this, man?
Cops everywhere. It's crazy.

16:18.151 --> 16:20.631
Right this way, sir.

16:20.675 --> 16:22.329
Appreciate
all your help.

16:22.372 --> 16:23.852
You need
anything at all,

16:23.895 --> 16:25.854
feel free to give me
a call, okay?

16:25.897 --> 16:28.639
Have a good one.

16:36.517 --> 16:41.043
[indistinct chatter]

16:41.087 --> 16:42.697
Hey.

16:42.740 --> 16:45.047
There you are. Come in, come in.
Shut the door.

16:45.091 --> 16:48.050
Thanks for stopping
by on short notice.

16:48.094 --> 16:50.052
Yeah, like I texted,
I was just next door in court.

16:50.096 --> 16:51.749
Yeah, but nobody saw you
come in here, right?

16:51.793 --> 16:53.186
Lots of people saw me come in.

16:53.229 --> 16:54.404
I went through security
and the whole thing.

16:54.448 --> 16:55.884
Yeah, but not your sister.

16:55.927 --> 16:57.016
No.

16:57.059 --> 16:58.452
Good, good, good.
Sit down, sit down.

16:58.495 --> 17:00.802
Anthony, is,
uh, everything okay?

17:00.845 --> 17:02.282
What's going on?I need

17:02.325 --> 17:04.545
your assistance with something,
and as usual,

17:04.588 --> 17:07.374
your brother Danny was
less than useful.

17:07.417 --> 17:08.853
Help with what?

17:18.994 --> 17:20.952
You talk to Danny already
about this?

17:20.996 --> 17:23.216
Yeah, and he told me
to take a hike.

17:23.259 --> 17:25.566
I second that motion.Oh, come on, Jamie.

17:25.609 --> 17:29.396
I expect that from your brother
but not from you.

17:29.439 --> 17:31.093
Yeah, well...

17:31.137 --> 17:33.095
You know what they say in city
government behind your back?

17:33.139 --> 17:35.793
I don't.They say forget Danny Reagan.

17:35.837 --> 17:38.231
The real rising star of the PD
is Jamie.

17:38.274 --> 17:41.060
He's the one that one day
could fill the old man's shoes.

17:41.103 --> 17:42.931
Even if that's true--
and I'm not sure it is--

17:42.974 --> 17:44.150
maybe it's
'cause I'm smart enough

17:44.193 --> 17:45.629
not to go touching
the third rail.

17:45.673 --> 17:48.328
All right,
I gave it my best shot.

17:48.371 --> 17:50.373
I was never here.

17:50.417 --> 17:52.288
Thanks.

17:52.332 --> 17:53.724
For nothing.

17:53.768 --> 17:56.249
[elevator bell dings]

17:56.292 --> 17:57.554
Oh!

17:57.598 --> 17:59.078
Oh...
Hey, what are you
doing here?

17:59.121 --> 18:00.992
I had a court appearance
next door and popped by

18:01.036 --> 18:03.604
to say hello,
but now I'm running late, so...Oh, well, wait.

18:03.647 --> 18:04.735
Hold up. How's Eddie?

18:04.779 --> 18:06.389
I heard she went
to the hospital.

18:06.433 --> 18:07.608
All better. Nothing's broken.

18:07.651 --> 18:09.523
That's great.Yeah.

18:09.566 --> 18:11.786
What?Nothing.

18:11.829 --> 18:13.004
You forget that I'm the one

18:13.048 --> 18:14.484
that used to pick you up
from school

18:14.528 --> 18:16.051
and help you with your homework

18:16.095 --> 18:17.400
and cook you dinner,

18:17.444 --> 18:19.794
so I know all your little looks,
Jameson Reagan.

18:19.837 --> 18:21.448
I'm sure it's nothing.

18:21.491 --> 18:24.538
Okay. Well, whatever it is,
it's tripping your Reagan gut.

18:24.581 --> 18:25.887
I can tell that.

18:25.930 --> 18:28.019
That Reagan gut--
a blessing and a curse.

18:28.063 --> 18:30.152
Tell me about it.
This one here,

18:30.196 --> 18:31.545
he is up to something.

18:31.588 --> 18:33.982
I don't know what it is.
I can't put my finger on it.

18:34.025 --> 18:35.505
[elevator bell dings]But...

18:35.549 --> 18:36.593
Oh, I got to go.

18:36.637 --> 18:37.551
Good to see you.Oh.

18:37.594 --> 18:39.030
Okay.

18:45.776 --> 18:47.909
[door opens]

18:47.952 --> 18:48.779
Surprise.

18:48.823 --> 18:50.433
I brought Wolfgangs.

18:50.477 --> 18:52.000
Jamie, I'm-I'm on my way out.

18:52.043 --> 18:53.784
I wish you would have told me.

18:53.828 --> 18:55.786
Oh, well, that's the thing
about surprises--

18:55.830 --> 18:58.876
they require the element...
of surprise.

18:58.920 --> 19:00.487
I'm sorry. Rain check?

19:00.530 --> 19:02.141
Sure, yeah. Where you headed?

19:02.184 --> 19:04.839
Charlotte is having boy troubles
again, so I'm meeting her

19:04.882 --> 19:07.146
for a drink.In those?

19:07.189 --> 19:09.017
What?Sure you don't want
to wear sneakers,

19:09.060 --> 19:11.324
in case you get
in another foot chase?

19:11.367 --> 19:12.499
Ha-ha.

19:12.542 --> 19:14.414
You know,
the thing about jokes is,

19:14.457 --> 19:16.720
they require the element
of funny.

19:17.460 --> 19:19.723
Have a good night.

19:20.463 --> 19:22.552
I love you.

19:23.553 --> 19:25.990
Oh, I remember
why EMS took me downtown.

19:26.034 --> 19:27.340
They said
the ER uptown

19:27.383 --> 19:29.907
was jampacked.

19:29.951 --> 19:31.431
Did they?

19:32.258 --> 19:33.563
Don't wait up.

19:51.973 --> 19:53.235
[sighs]

19:57.674 --> 20:00.155
Hello, Daniel.

20:00.938 --> 20:02.418
You only refer to me as Daniel

20:02.462 --> 20:04.855
when you're upset at me
about something.

20:04.899 --> 20:06.379
Look at him.

20:06.422 --> 20:08.076
Okay, before
your heart breaks

20:08.119 --> 20:09.686
into a million pieces,

20:09.730 --> 20:11.732
maybe you should look
at the innocent 14-year-old kid

20:11.775 --> 20:14.387
that him and his crew put
in a hospital bed.

20:14.430 --> 20:15.953
You walked him into a beatdown.

20:15.997 --> 20:17.085
No, I did not.

20:17.128 --> 20:18.434
I gave him a ride home.

20:18.478 --> 20:21.220
Whatever happens after that
is not on me.

20:21.263 --> 20:23.831
Maybe he'll learn
not to be so loyal

20:23.874 --> 20:25.267
to people
who aren't loyal to him.

20:25.311 --> 20:27.095
Oh, so now we're doing
an eye for an eye.

20:27.138 --> 20:28.444
[sighs]:
No.I didn't realize

20:28.488 --> 20:30.577
NYPD had updated
their Patrol Guide

20:30.620 --> 20:33.275
with pages
from the Old Testament.

20:33.319 --> 20:35.146
I gave him a ride home.

20:35.190 --> 20:37.105
I think you should go home.

20:37.845 --> 20:38.846
Now.

20:55.384 --> 20:56.733
Anthony.

20:56.777 --> 20:59.040
You sound surprised to find me.

20:59.083 --> 21:00.737
In my own office.

21:00.781 --> 21:02.217
I was looking for you.

21:02.261 --> 21:04.437
Did you think I was hiding
under those papers?

21:04.480 --> 21:06.874
Don't be cute.
You're in trouble with me.

21:06.917 --> 21:08.179
You're snooping
through my stuff,

21:08.223 --> 21:09.790
and I'm in trouble with you?

21:09.833 --> 21:11.661
I wasn't snooping.Yeah, good racket you got.

21:11.705 --> 21:14.882
I was not snooping-- I was
looking for the Debernardo file.

21:14.925 --> 21:16.710
And that would be
in the file cabinet

21:16.753 --> 21:17.798
with all the other files.

21:19.016 --> 21:21.149
Well, if you were here
from time to time,

21:21.192 --> 21:23.934
I wouldn't have to go looking
for stuff by myself.

21:23.978 --> 21:25.501
I was gone less than an hour.

21:25.545 --> 21:27.286
Gone where?Personal time.

21:27.329 --> 21:29.679
Well, you're taking a lot
of that this week, aren't you?

21:29.723 --> 21:30.724
Every time I
come in here,

21:30.767 --> 21:31.899
you've gone somewhere

21:31.942 --> 21:33.379
doing God knows what.

21:33.422 --> 21:35.729
I was at my doctor
having a consultation

21:35.772 --> 21:37.600
about my upcoming colonoscopy.

21:37.644 --> 21:39.341
Should I tell him not to bother

21:39.385 --> 21:41.561
now that you're doing
the procedure?

21:41.604 --> 21:43.302
You think you're funny?

21:43.345 --> 21:45.347
I thought that one
wasn't half bad.

21:46.174 --> 21:48.568
You know what I think?
I think you're up to something,

21:48.611 --> 21:52.180
and I'm gonna find out
exactly what it is.

21:53.747 --> 21:55.270
DANNY:
I mean, honestly,

21:55.314 --> 21:57.185
she has no idea
how difficult it is

21:57.228 --> 21:58.926
for us to even make a case

21:58.969 --> 22:00.101
these days.

22:00.144 --> 22:01.842
We got both hands tied
behind our backs,

22:01.885 --> 22:03.887
and every bad guy in the city
knows it.

22:03.931 --> 22:05.585
Then she makes it out
like I'm the one

22:05.628 --> 22:07.456
who did something wrong--
can you believe that?

22:08.457 --> 22:09.937
Yeah, Danny, I can.

22:09.980 --> 22:11.286
W...And you know that--
that's why

22:11.330 --> 22:12.853
you keep asking me
to let you off the hook.

22:12.896 --> 22:14.811
But I didn't ask you
for anything.

22:14.855 --> 22:17.597
Then why do you keep saying
the same thing over and over

22:17.640 --> 22:19.555
and waiting for my response?

22:19.599 --> 22:20.600
Because she's annoying.

22:20.643 --> 22:22.079
I'm trying to let you know

22:22.123 --> 22:24.691
how ridiculous
my sister's being.

22:24.734 --> 22:26.257
She'sthe one being ridiculous?

22:26.301 --> 22:29.086
Okay, so what, you're
pissed off at me, too, now?

22:29.130 --> 22:30.914
What did I do wrong?

22:30.958 --> 22:32.176
I think you know.

22:32.220 --> 22:34.527
No, I don't know. Honestly.

22:34.570 --> 22:37.007
Well, you should.

22:41.011 --> 22:42.622
But you have to.

22:43.405 --> 22:47.017
Okay, maybe not have to,
but should do.

22:49.150 --> 22:51.239
Or at least
strongly consider doing.

22:51.282 --> 22:53.459
Delivering the statement.

22:53.502 --> 22:55.199
I considered it.

22:55.243 --> 22:57.332
Well, if it was me,
I'd just bite the bullet

22:57.376 --> 22:59.029
and talk the
talk and...

23:00.901 --> 23:03.338
But it's not me.

23:03.382 --> 23:04.731
No.

23:04.774 --> 23:06.820
It's him.

23:06.863 --> 23:09.344
And no matter what I say
or how I say it,

23:09.388 --> 23:11.477
it's gonna come out as:
"Dear Leader,

23:11.520 --> 23:14.001
who am I but a stone
in your shoe."

23:14.044 --> 23:15.176
That's nowhere in here.

23:15.219 --> 23:17.831
Doesn't matter.

23:17.874 --> 23:19.833
And I think he's bluffing.

23:19.876 --> 23:21.400
Can you see his cards?

23:21.443 --> 23:22.749
I know his tells.

23:22.792 --> 23:24.664
Can you see his cards?

23:24.707 --> 23:26.274
[sighs]

23:27.493 --> 23:28.885
No.

23:28.929 --> 23:30.496
No.

23:30.539 --> 23:34.151
And speaking as someone
who's 100% behind you in this,

23:34.195 --> 23:36.589
not showing up is gonna
be taken by everybody

23:36.632 --> 23:38.547
as you escalating it.

23:38.591 --> 23:40.549
Is that what you want?

23:45.424 --> 23:47.426
No.

23:52.518 --> 23:54.563
[sighs]

23:58.567 --> 24:01.483
[low, indistinct chatter][cameras clicking]

24:07.358 --> 24:10.187
Afternoon, everybody.

24:10.231 --> 24:12.929
I'll make this quick.

24:14.801 --> 24:17.238
[sighs]:
I have a...

24:17.281 --> 24:20.023
statement regarding
the arrest my detail made

24:20.067 --> 24:23.897
on a quality-of-life misdemeanor
the other day

24:23.940 --> 24:28.336
and, uh, my part... in it.

24:30.381 --> 24:32.471
When you've been
a police officer

24:32.514 --> 24:37.040
as long as I was,
you can't help but react

24:37.084 --> 24:41.088
when you come upon a crime
in progress.

24:41.828 --> 24:43.917
However...

24:43.960 --> 24:49.575
that instinct
has to be tempered...

24:49.618 --> 24:51.228
by...

24:56.973 --> 25:00.673
Actually, my statement's
in the form...

25:00.716 --> 25:02.326
of a question.

25:02.370 --> 25:04.590
Who wants to live in a city

25:04.633 --> 25:07.549
where the police commissioner
comes upon a crime,

25:07.593 --> 25:09.638
in progress,

25:09.682 --> 25:12.119
and just keeps driving?

25:13.163 --> 25:15.557
What's the message there?

25:15.601 --> 25:19.169
[reporters shouting]

25:29.876 --> 25:31.573
Can I help you?

25:31.617 --> 25:33.357
Henry, it's me.

25:33.401 --> 25:34.620
Anthony.

25:34.663 --> 25:35.969
Abetamarco.

25:36.012 --> 25:37.187
I used to work for you,
remember?

25:37.231 --> 25:38.754
Doesn't ring a bell.

25:44.412 --> 25:45.935
A little senior citizen humor.

25:45.979 --> 25:48.982
Ah, you got me pretty good
there, I'll tell you.

25:49.025 --> 25:51.724
Then you're losing
a step, Detective.

25:51.767 --> 25:53.900
Look, I don't want to take
up too much of your time.

25:53.943 --> 25:57.077
Mets game doesn't start
for three hours. We're good.

25:57.120 --> 25:58.600
Okay, full disclosure.

25:58.644 --> 26:00.733
I've already approached
Danny and Jamie with this.

26:00.776 --> 26:02.256
They both sent me packing.

26:02.299 --> 26:03.605
So this is about Erin?

26:03.649 --> 26:05.868
You want to approach her
about something,

26:05.912 --> 26:07.304
but you don't know how?

26:07.348 --> 26:08.654
Yeah.Far as I can tell,

26:08.697 --> 26:11.657
nobody knows her these days
better than you.

26:11.700 --> 26:12.875
Fair point.

26:12.919 --> 26:14.834
But this is bigger
than just her and me.

26:14.877 --> 26:16.096
How big?

26:27.586 --> 26:29.370
Aha.

26:31.981 --> 26:33.069
I'll make the call.

26:33.113 --> 26:34.114
But not to Erin?

26:34.157 --> 26:35.202
No.

26:35.245 --> 26:37.726
To the one you came to me for.

26:42.339 --> 26:43.689
[footsteps approaching]

26:45.038 --> 26:46.822
[sighs]

26:49.695 --> 26:51.435
You were right.

26:52.393 --> 26:55.744
I'm sorry, can you
say that again so I can get it

26:55.788 --> 26:58.573
on video?Okay, enough.

26:58.617 --> 27:02.359
I admit it, I was...
[takes deep breath]

27:02.403 --> 27:04.448
[clears throat]Okay, Fonzi, spit it out.

27:04.492 --> 27:05.711
I...

27:05.754 --> 27:07.669
wasn't right.

27:07.713 --> 27:09.236
You were right.

27:09.279 --> 27:10.890
About what?

27:11.673 --> 27:13.719
You were right to be pissed off

27:13.762 --> 27:16.939
that I went out as a decoy
without backup.

27:17.723 --> 27:20.726
We're all struggling
with the new way of the world.

27:20.769 --> 27:23.250
We can't do things
the way we used to.

27:23.293 --> 27:25.600
I mean, it's frustrating,
I know,

27:25.644 --> 27:28.690
but it doesn't mean
you go it alone.

27:28.734 --> 27:31.388
I know. And I know
we've been over this before.

27:31.432 --> 27:33.652
It's just very difficult
to sit on my hands

27:33.695 --> 27:35.654
when there's a 14-year-old
in the hospital,

27:35.697 --> 27:37.743
and we can't nail
the sons of bitches who did it

27:37.786 --> 27:40.441
because they got everybody
running scared.

27:40.484 --> 27:41.921
Yeah, I'm with you on that one.

27:41.964 --> 27:43.923
But it doesn't mean
you go crashing through

27:43.966 --> 27:46.403
every rule and procedure
like the old days.

27:46.447 --> 27:48.405
You've still got to do it
by the book.

27:48.449 --> 27:50.843
Sometimes the book
doesn't get the job done,

27:50.886 --> 27:52.801
and that really sucks.

27:53.584 --> 27:56.849
It's like jujitsu--
instead of working

27:56.892 --> 27:59.068
against the book,
we make the book work for us.

27:59.112 --> 28:00.504
Well, how do we do that?

28:00.548 --> 28:02.985
Yeah, I spoke to a friend
of mine in the gang unit,

28:03.029 --> 28:04.770
and I told him about the case.

28:04.813 --> 28:07.250
And he showed me
some of the photos

28:07.294 --> 28:09.513
of the gang we're after.

28:11.559 --> 28:13.430
Hmm.

28:14.344 --> 28:16.520
No way.

28:23.353 --> 28:25.921
Yeah, that's Ricky, all right.

28:25.965 --> 28:28.184
Is Ricky part of your gang?

28:29.533 --> 28:31.231
Come on,
is he or isn't he?

28:31.274 --> 28:33.668
You forgetting something,
Detective?

28:34.843 --> 28:37.585
I'm sorry
for what happened to you.

28:39.021 --> 28:42.764
I shouldn't have dropped you off
into a situation like that.

28:42.808 --> 28:44.287
Sorry.

28:47.160 --> 28:48.770
We're good.

28:48.814 --> 28:50.337
That's the game.

28:50.380 --> 28:52.252
[softly]:
Well...

28:53.296 --> 28:54.820
Now that we're all friends,

28:54.863 --> 28:56.909
can you tell us
if Ricky's part of your crew?

28:56.952 --> 28:58.780
Think I want
my other nose broken?

28:58.824 --> 29:00.956
We already know
Ricky runs with you.

29:01.000 --> 29:03.350
The real question is,
why would Ricky let his own crew

29:03.393 --> 29:05.004
take out his brother?

29:05.047 --> 29:06.832
That ain't how it went down.

29:06.875 --> 29:08.572
Well, how did it go down?

29:10.052 --> 29:14.622
Seeing as I can't ever show
my face again in the hood...

29:14.665 --> 29:17.843
and we've gathered here
all friendly like...

29:17.886 --> 29:20.628
shouldn't we start talking
about a deal,

29:20.671 --> 29:24.327
Madam Assistant
District Attorney?

29:27.896 --> 29:29.376
[fans cheering on TV]

29:29.419 --> 29:31.030
EDDIE:
I'll be quick.

29:31.073 --> 29:33.206
Couple hours.

29:33.249 --> 29:35.382
SoulCycle takes two hours?

29:35.425 --> 29:37.079
I got to get there, change,

29:37.123 --> 29:39.168
and then come back.

29:39.212 --> 29:41.954
All right, have fun.
Don't forget your cycling shoes.

29:41.997 --> 29:43.520
Right.

30:01.625 --> 30:04.498
[footsteps approaching]

30:06.282 --> 30:08.458
[sighs]

30:09.546 --> 30:11.635
Okay. I'm outie.

30:13.159 --> 30:14.551
What?

30:15.291 --> 30:16.989
Work out tomorrow. Stay.

30:17.032 --> 30:18.817
Watch a movie with me.

30:19.600 --> 30:21.515
Just pick something good.

30:21.558 --> 30:23.647
We'll watch when I get home.

30:27.826 --> 30:30.176
GORMLEY:
Boss, these are crazy times.

30:30.219 --> 30:32.395
We all feel that.

30:32.439 --> 30:34.397
Which is why,
now more than ever,

30:34.441 --> 30:36.095
we need to hold steady.

30:36.138 --> 30:38.358
Need youto hold steady.

30:40.447 --> 30:42.449
Never steadier.

30:42.492 --> 30:45.017
Do you really want to risk
losing the war

30:45.060 --> 30:46.801
just to win a bar fight?

30:46.845 --> 30:48.498
That's not what I'm doing.This plays

30:48.542 --> 30:50.370
a lot like two rams
who've locked horns

30:50.413 --> 30:52.372
and are having a hard time
unlocking.

30:52.415 --> 30:53.895
Yeah, I've seen those videos.

30:53.939 --> 30:56.811
One of them has to bow down
and twist his neck.

30:56.855 --> 30:58.900
Not gonna be me.

30:58.944 --> 31:00.032
[chuckles softly]

31:00.075 --> 31:02.251
You have an answer
for everything.

31:02.295 --> 31:03.470
I give up. I really do.

31:03.513 --> 31:05.515
Garrett, it isn't pride.

31:05.559 --> 31:07.474
It isn't ego.

31:07.517 --> 31:09.824
If our cops second-guessed
every move

31:09.868 --> 31:12.087
the way they're asking me to,

31:12.131 --> 31:14.960
we'd be attending a funeral
every week.

31:15.003 --> 31:16.700
Yes,

31:16.744 --> 31:18.964
but you're not a cop;
you're their leader.

31:19.007 --> 31:19.834
All the more reason.

31:19.878 --> 31:21.618
To deescalate the situation.

31:21.662 --> 31:24.143
To lead by that example.That woman

31:24.186 --> 31:26.145
was genuinely afraid.

31:26.188 --> 31:28.799
She had Maryland plates--
she was probably just visiting

31:28.843 --> 31:31.454
or passing through--
and she had no idea

31:31.498 --> 31:33.979
what that guy
might be capable of.

31:34.022 --> 31:34.980
Look, I get that...

31:35.023 --> 31:36.329
So we deescalated.

31:36.372 --> 31:38.244
We stepped in.
We made the arrest.

31:38.287 --> 31:40.899
End of story.

31:41.682 --> 31:44.859
Boss, we just don't want you
to get fired.

31:44.903 --> 31:47.906
We're with you 100%,
like Garrett says.

31:49.255 --> 31:50.821
But we'd rather be
with you up here

31:50.865 --> 31:53.346
than, say, meeting for lunch
every couple of months,

31:53.389 --> 31:56.392
telling war stories.

31:57.741 --> 32:00.744
So, how do you budget
your integrity?

32:01.528 --> 32:02.964
How do you say...

32:03.008 --> 32:06.359
"Okay, just one more helping
of humble pie,

32:06.402 --> 32:08.578
and then that's it"?

32:08.622 --> 32:11.277
Nah. You got a lot of coin
in that bank.

32:11.320 --> 32:14.236
Hand to God, there is no one
who thinks you've shed an ounce

32:14.280 --> 32:17.326
of integrity over the course
of this very difficult year.

32:17.370 --> 32:20.416
What they said, times ten.

32:23.463 --> 32:25.682
Thank you.

32:25.726 --> 32:28.381
The moment Ithink that,

32:28.424 --> 32:30.949
the bugler
can start playing taps.

32:41.307 --> 32:44.049
Good to see you're out
of the hospital okay.Thank you.

32:44.092 --> 32:45.050
I'm feeling much better.

32:45.093 --> 32:46.747
That's great.Yeah.

32:46.790 --> 32:49.054
You, uh, able to
move about at all,

32:49.097 --> 32:51.578
or are you kind of just
stuck there on the sofa?

32:51.621 --> 32:53.014
No, I can get around
pretty good.

32:53.058 --> 32:55.060
Doctor said
he's about 90%.

32:55.103 --> 32:56.626
That's amazing.
Good for you.

32:56.670 --> 32:58.933
Yeah. You able
to stand up, too?

32:58.977 --> 33:00.239
Yeah, no problem.Hey.

33:00.282 --> 33:01.718
Show them how good you're doing.

33:01.762 --> 33:03.068
Well...

33:03.111 --> 33:05.157
Look, Ma, no hands.[laughs]

33:05.200 --> 33:07.115
Miracles of
modern medicine.

33:07.159 --> 33:09.639
We wouldn't be here if you guys
didn't show up the way you did.

33:09.683 --> 33:11.032
Eh.

33:11.076 --> 33:13.034
How about the rest
of your limbs?
I'm all good.

33:13.078 --> 33:15.863
Wow. Look at that--
he's got all the rotation back.

33:15.906 --> 33:16.820
Mm-hmm, yeah.

33:16.864 --> 33:18.561
But can you do
it in reverse,

33:18.605 --> 33:20.520
is the real question.Oh, yeah, easy peasy.

33:21.129 --> 33:22.957
Yo, yo, yo, what the...?Wait, what
are you doing?

33:23.001 --> 33:25.090
We're arresting both of you,
that's what we're doing.

33:25.133 --> 33:26.961
For what?For falsely reporting
an incident.

33:27.005 --> 33:29.572
It's a crime.I didn't falsely
report anything.

33:29.616 --> 33:30.704
Yes, you did.

33:30.747 --> 33:32.358
You weren't
robbed, Matthew.

33:32.401 --> 33:33.837
You were joining
that stupid gang.

33:33.881 --> 33:35.839
That beatdown was
your initiation.

33:35.883 --> 33:37.667
Orchestrated
by your own brother.

33:37.711 --> 33:41.367
So you can consider this
your initiation to life

33:41.410 --> 33:42.629
if you stay
in the gang.

33:42.672 --> 33:43.804
Let's go.[grunts]

33:45.153 --> 33:47.416
â™ª

34:09.047 --> 34:11.005
Okay, stop right there!

34:11.049 --> 34:13.181
Wha...?

34:13.225 --> 34:14.661
Jamie.

34:14.704 --> 34:15.749
Hey, what are you doing?

34:15.792 --> 34:18.012
What are youdoing?

34:18.056 --> 34:19.405
You following me?

34:19.448 --> 34:21.581
No.Yes, you are.

34:21.624 --> 34:23.713
Yeah, maybe I am.

34:23.757 --> 34:25.063
Why?

34:25.106 --> 34:26.499
Because you've been acting
really strange lately,

34:26.542 --> 34:28.109
and I can't figure out
what you're up to.

34:28.153 --> 34:29.676
Why don't you just ask me,

34:29.719 --> 34:32.679
instead of following me around
like a creepy stalker?

34:32.722 --> 34:35.029
Because I haveasked you,
and multiple times.

34:35.073 --> 34:37.771
But every time I do,
you get... you get defensive.

34:37.814 --> 34:39.599
I do not get defensive!

34:39.642 --> 34:41.079
You slam your computer shut
when I come in,

34:41.122 --> 34:42.689
you give me one-word
answers, and, Eddie,

34:42.732 --> 34:45.126
you lied to me.Lied?

34:45.170 --> 34:47.694
Yeah, when I came in the
hospital, I talked to the EMTs.

34:47.737 --> 34:49.696
They told me that they brought
you there because it was

34:49.739 --> 34:50.697
the closest hospital.

34:50.740 --> 34:51.959
You told me you were uptown!

34:53.091 --> 34:55.963
Okay, right, I did that.Well, why?

34:56.006 --> 34:58.226
'Cause I don't want you to know
what I'm doing.

34:58.270 --> 34:59.967
What are you doing?

35:00.010 --> 35:01.882
Nothing!

35:01.925 --> 35:04.406
Then who the hell is Barry?

35:06.016 --> 35:07.757
[exhales]

35:11.544 --> 35:13.807
Okay, future leaders of America,

35:13.850 --> 35:16.331
open your books to page 88.

35:16.375 --> 35:17.898
Roll call.

35:17.941 --> 35:21.162
Now, you've all been
on the receiving end of this.

35:21.206 --> 35:22.511
Now...

35:22.555 --> 35:24.034
Hey, Barry.

35:24.078 --> 35:25.645
Sorry I'm late.

35:26.428 --> 35:27.647
Now it's time

35:27.690 --> 35:29.257
to learn...

35:29.301 --> 35:30.911
That's Barry?

35:30.954 --> 35:33.000
Mm-hmm.

35:35.568 --> 35:37.961
You're studying
for the sergeant's exam.

35:39.876 --> 35:41.574
I was afraid to tell you.

35:41.617 --> 35:44.229
I didn't know
if you would like it.

35:44.272 --> 35:46.448
Are you mad?

35:47.232 --> 35:50.235
I think it's a great idea,
you trying to make sergeant.

35:50.278 --> 35:53.151
I have absolutely no problem
that you're here.

35:55.196 --> 35:59.722
But if I'm being honest,
I don't like how we got here.

36:19.742 --> 36:22.484
Must have been hell
to be your partner on the job.

36:22.528 --> 36:25.226
Nah. You could ask them.

36:26.358 --> 36:27.750
Guys who like the spotlight

36:27.794 --> 36:29.230
don't mind putting themselves
on the spot.

36:29.274 --> 36:31.580
I don't like the spotlight.They get antsy

36:31.624 --> 36:33.626
if they've been
out of the spotlight.

36:33.669 --> 36:35.367
So they start something.

36:35.410 --> 36:39.675
And everyone around them
is pinned in that spotlight.

36:40.502 --> 36:43.331
Aw, don't be so hard
on yourself.

36:44.202 --> 36:46.769
You knew damn well
what you were doing.

36:46.813 --> 36:48.641
Hey, I'm a cop at heart.

36:48.684 --> 36:50.295
I did what a cop does.

36:50.338 --> 36:54.037
A cop who subconsciously needs
the spotlight.

36:54.821 --> 36:56.301
That's all you got?

36:56.344 --> 36:58.303
Barstool Freud?

36:58.346 --> 36:59.521
[chuckles softly]

36:59.565 --> 37:00.609
No.

37:00.653 --> 37:02.220
That's not all I got.

37:06.093 --> 37:09.531
I want to respect your many
years of service to this city

37:09.575 --> 37:13.927
and the affection and loyalty
you command from our police.

37:15.624 --> 37:19.498
So I'll accept your resignation
instead of firing you.

37:19.541 --> 37:23.241
You can go out
under your own steam.

37:27.027 --> 37:30.160
Happy to coordinate
through Garrett.

37:30.204 --> 37:32.250
You guys take the wheel.

37:36.558 --> 37:38.952
I appreciate that.

37:40.301 --> 37:43.304
But I want to respect
the majority of citizens

37:43.348 --> 37:44.740
who elected you

37:44.784 --> 37:49.354
and your positive
accomplishments as mayor, so...

37:49.397 --> 37:52.835
I will respectfully decline
your offer.

37:53.575 --> 37:55.185
You want me to fire you?

37:55.229 --> 37:58.319
No. And you don't want
to fire me.

37:58.363 --> 38:00.713
And you don't want me to resign.

38:00.756 --> 38:02.105
I just said I did.

38:02.149 --> 38:04.543
No. Mr. Mayor,
think through the next step.

38:04.586 --> 38:05.805
What next step?

38:06.458 --> 38:07.937
My replacement.

38:07.981 --> 38:12.202
Who are you gonna get to step in
for the PC you fired

38:12.246 --> 38:13.769
for arresting a guy

38:13.813 --> 38:16.511
who was threatening a woman
on our streets.

38:16.555 --> 38:18.948
It's a pretty long list.

38:18.992 --> 38:23.562
Yeah, and the top 20 men
and women will sing your praises

38:23.605 --> 38:26.086
and then say they're busy
that night.

38:26.129 --> 38:28.131
You sure think a lot
of yourself.

38:28.175 --> 38:32.440
It's not about me or...
deference to me.

38:32.484 --> 38:34.268
It's about their own asses.

38:34.312 --> 38:37.445
It's about not being set up
to fail.

38:37.489 --> 38:38.925
You don't know that.

38:38.968 --> 38:40.622
Oh, yeah, I do know that.

38:40.666 --> 38:45.018
There's only a handful of people
who do what I do on this scale.

38:46.019 --> 38:48.195
And they got a grapevine.

38:51.807 --> 38:53.766
You poisoned the well?

38:53.809 --> 38:55.768
No. Not at all.

38:55.811 --> 38:59.075
But this thing of ours...

38:59.119 --> 39:01.904
this thing of ours is out there
for all to see,

39:01.948 --> 39:05.647
and the ones you'd want,
they've been watching.

39:07.475 --> 39:09.651
[sighs]

39:09.695 --> 39:11.523
Married couple with kids.

39:11.566 --> 39:14.177
They love their kids,
but each other not so much.

39:14.221 --> 39:17.093
They're good people,
but oil and water together,

39:17.137 --> 39:19.835
so they agree to separate.

39:19.879 --> 39:21.968
What?Like I said,

39:22.011 --> 39:23.839
good people, love their kids,

39:23.883 --> 39:27.147
so one doesn't bad-mouth
the other to the kids.

39:27.190 --> 39:29.497
One doesn't slash
the other's tires

39:29.541 --> 39:32.152
the weekend they have custody.

39:34.676 --> 39:36.939
Just go.

39:40.203 --> 39:41.901
Okay.

39:42.858 --> 39:45.208
Thanks for hearing me out.

39:46.253 --> 39:49.474
You comparing the citizens
and the cops of this city

39:49.517 --> 39:52.694
to kids in a divorce, how do
you think that's gonna play?

39:57.003 --> 40:00.093
I hope it doesn't play at all.

40:01.573 --> 40:03.183
[door closes]

40:03.226 --> 40:05.228
I'll bet you do.

40:13.715 --> 40:15.848
I was not playing chicken.

40:15.891 --> 40:17.240
Sounds like you were.

40:17.284 --> 40:18.851
Well, I wasn't.

40:18.894 --> 40:20.200
If it walks like a duck
and talks like a duck.

40:20.243 --> 40:21.984
Then it's definitely
a chicken.

40:22.028 --> 40:23.682
Pop, little help here?

40:23.725 --> 40:25.205
[quacking]

40:25.248 --> 40:27.120
That's more of a duck, Grandpa,
not a chicken.

40:27.163 --> 40:30.210
Okay, wise guy,
what's a chicken sound like?

40:30.253 --> 40:31.951
A chicken is more like a...
like a...

40:31.994 --> 40:34.257
[clucking loudly]
ERIN:
Sounds more

40:34.301 --> 40:36.390
like a seal to me.Yeah, like a wounded seal

40:36.434 --> 40:38.348
getting an enema.

40:38.392 --> 40:39.437
DANNY:
Ew.

40:40.786 --> 40:43.266
I'm sorry, I have no idea
where that came from.

40:44.311 --> 40:45.225
Okay.

40:45.268 --> 40:46.879
It was accurate, at least.Hey!

40:46.922 --> 40:49.882
[chuckles]:
Okay, is everyone finished
with this now?

40:49.925 --> 40:51.057
Yes, we're finished.

40:51.100 --> 40:53.015
And the verdict is in.

40:53.059 --> 40:54.756
He was definitely
playing chicken.

40:54.800 --> 40:56.018
Ridiculous!

40:56.062 --> 40:57.585
A dangerous game of chicken

40:57.629 --> 40:59.108
and one you could have lost.

40:59.152 --> 41:01.241
And then where
would we be?

41:01.284 --> 41:04.157
Hey, I just knew
it would work out, okay?

41:04.200 --> 41:06.072
You didn't know that.
You thought that.

41:06.115 --> 41:07.552
An educated guess,
at best.Yeah.

41:07.595 --> 41:10.032
The mayor could have fired you,
and frankly, I'm...

41:10.076 --> 41:11.599
I'm surprised he didn't.

41:11.643 --> 41:13.166
Okay.

41:13.209 --> 41:16.169
But a life well lived is one
where you risk everything

41:16.212 --> 41:19.259
for what really matters to you.

41:21.217 --> 41:22.741
Why do I feel like that

41:22.784 --> 41:25.265
was specifically directed
towards me?

41:25.308 --> 41:27.485
It wasn't.

41:29.182 --> 41:31.532
I'm gonna take the Fifth
on this conversation.

41:31.576 --> 41:32.446
SEAN:
I have no idea

41:32.490 --> 41:33.534
what's going on.

41:33.578 --> 41:34.622
The Fifth.

41:34.666 --> 41:35.754
Take the Fifth.

41:35.797 --> 41:37.146
JANKO:
Yeah, do not look at me.

41:37.190 --> 41:39.584
I'm still recovering
from that whole enema thing.

41:39.627 --> 41:41.977
Do you really want me
to put you on the stand

41:42.021 --> 41:43.457
and cross-examine you?

41:43.501 --> 41:45.590
No, I do not.Okay. So what's going on?

41:45.633 --> 41:48.288
Maybe you should look
under your placemat.

41:48.331 --> 41:50.290
Wonder what could be there.

42:06.393 --> 42:09.570
"Erin Reagan for
Manhattan District Attorney."

42:09.614 --> 42:10.789
[others oohing]

42:10.832 --> 42:12.878
[indistinct chatter]

42:12.921 --> 42:14.444
Where'd that come from?Who did this?

42:14.488 --> 42:15.707
Don't look at me.

42:15.750 --> 42:17.186
Wonder who did that.I don't know, really.

42:17.230 --> 42:19.101
[overlapping chatter]Still no idea.

42:19.145 --> 42:20.320
JANKO:So...

42:20.363 --> 42:21.887
Although it does have
a nice ring to it.

42:21.930 --> 42:23.279
Yeah. Little bit.

42:23.323 --> 42:25.238
Little bit of
a nice ring.

42:26.021 --> 42:28.284
All in favor?

42:29.285 --> 42:30.548
Aye.

42:31.505 --> 42:32.462
Aye.

42:32.506 --> 42:33.855
Aye.

42:34.595 --> 42:35.901
Aye.

42:37.206 --> 42:38.425
Aye.

42:38.468 --> 42:40.601

I'm just an accomplice.
