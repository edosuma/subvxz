Look, I'm not gonna let
you just pass me off...

00:18.888 --> 00:21.151
Ma'am, I need you
to calm down.I've been calm!

01:36.357 --> 01:38.489
Yes, the situation was contained
at the front gate.

01:38.533 --> 01:40.535
It was an isolated incident
with no connection

01:40.578 --> 01:41.884
to the lockdown we had
last month.

01:41.927 --> 01:43.364
Okay, appreciate it.

No comment at this time.
Thank you.

One reporter, Homeland,

01:50.632 --> 01:52.155
and Agent Wright
from the REACT team.

Who do you have, SECNAV?

01:55.027 --> 01:56.551
Oh, no, I'm making a reservation
at The Cooler.

01:56.594 --> 01:58.596
The Cooler?
Like, the restaurant

01:58.640 --> 01:59.989
where everything's made of ice?

02:00.032 --> 02:02.513
It's like a five-star meal
in a five-star igloo.

Oh, there's no way
you're getting in there.

02:04.211 --> 02:05.995
I heard Oprah's
in town this week--

even she can't get a table.
Special Agent McGee.

Hello.

02:14.438 --> 02:15.831
Before they put me on hold,

02:15.874 --> 02:17.224
I forwarded all my calls
to Reeves.

02:17.267 --> 02:19.182
Are you kidding me, bro?

02:19.226 --> 02:21.010
My phone has been
ringing double-time.

02:21.053 --> 02:22.707
Sucks to be you, baby.

Not everything's
about you, mate.

02:33.544 --> 02:35.198
It's not?Yeah, that's right.

02:35.242 --> 02:36.547
No new developments to speak of.

02:36.591 --> 02:38.941
You guys, it is a madhouse
down there.

There's a line
of news vans

right outside the gate.

Ooh, is Oprah touring
the navy yard?

No, no, there was an arrest
at the front gate this morning.

02:53.129 --> 02:56.045
What happened?We don't have full details yet--
still waiting

02:56.088 --> 02:58.134
on an update from Gibbs.

03:00.310 --> 03:02.138
Who is she?

03:02.182 --> 03:04.140
My mother.
Retired navy.

03:04.184 --> 03:05.228
Name?

03:05.272 --> 03:06.838
Chief Petty Officer
Mae Carter.

03:06.882 --> 03:08.492
And you are...

03:08.536 --> 03:10.625
Sara Carter.

03:10.668 --> 03:11.843
This isn't about me.

03:11.887 --> 03:14.368
You punch a guard
at the navy yard gate,

03:14.411 --> 03:15.891
it becomes about you.

03:15.934 --> 03:19.155
My mother was a master-at-arms/
command investigator.

03:19.199 --> 03:20.939
Did three tours
in the Middle East.

03:20.983 --> 03:23.290
This one was Kuwait.
Desert Storm.

03:26.293 --> 03:28.904
She left her kid and ran
straight into a war zone.

03:28.947 --> 03:31.907
Same as every man
she served with.

03:31.950 --> 03:34.257
Just like me.

03:34.301 --> 03:35.389
I left my daughter.

03:35.432 --> 03:37.521
Desert Storm.

03:41.395 --> 03:45.442
Guards found this in your
bag when they searched it.

03:45.486 --> 03:47.314
That your mom, too?

03:49.403 --> 03:51.405
It was taken
26 years later.

03:51.448 --> 03:53.189
It's a self-portrait.

03:53.233 --> 03:55.060
She took it a week
before she died.

03:55.104 --> 03:58.150
All right.

03:58.194 --> 04:00.240
All right, I'm listening.

04:02.459 --> 04:05.419
She was shot and killed by
an intruder in her own house.

04:05.462 --> 04:07.290
Virginia State Police
did nothing.

04:07.334 --> 04:09.161
They let it go unsolved
for a year.

04:09.205 --> 04:11.120
Yeah, well, getting yourself
arrested isn't gonna help.

04:11.163 --> 04:12.426
I don't need a lecture.

04:12.469 --> 04:13.644
I need you
to take this case.

04:13.688 --> 04:15.646
See, I don't like
that word "need."

04:15.690 --> 04:18.606
Come on with the dancing.
Okay?

04:18.649 --> 04:19.998
You don't get to sit
on that side of the table

04:20.042 --> 04:20.999
and make demands.

04:21.043 --> 04:22.087
Well, I'm making them!

04:25.221 --> 04:28.659
My mom gave 20 years of her life
to serve this country.

04:28.703 --> 04:31.140
You say you're a vet,
you know what that means.

04:33.708 --> 04:37.494
You kick me out of here,
I'll camp out at the front gate.

04:37.538 --> 04:39.453
Hell, I'll find your front door.

04:39.496 --> 04:44.327
I need you to take this case
and solve it.

04:44.371 --> 04:46.634
For her.

04:51.334 --> 04:53.510
NEWSMAN:
This morning's disturbance

04:53.554 --> 04:55.338
was caused by a woman
identified as

04:55.382 --> 04:57.209
28-year-old Sara Carter.

04:57.253 --> 05:00.125
Carter was reportedly there
to demand that NCIS

05:00.169 --> 05:01.692
solve the murder of her mother.

05:01.736 --> 05:03.215
And thanks to cell phone video

05:03.259 --> 05:04.956
taken by an onlooker
at the scene,

05:05.000 --> 05:06.784
we have a pretty good idea
of what happened

05:06.828 --> 05:08.569
when Carter's appeal went awry.

05:08.612 --> 05:09.918
She's got a heck of a left.

05:09.961 --> 05:12.094
Really fast.
So?

05:12.137 --> 05:14.879
SECNAV has asked me
to draft a press release.

05:14.923 --> 05:16.533
Let me guess.

05:16.577 --> 05:18.753
"We'll support
the Virginia State Police

05:18.796 --> 05:19.971
"in every way possible

05:20.015 --> 05:21.930
"to solve the murder
of Mae Carter.

05:21.973 --> 05:24.933
"However, this case does not
fall under the jurisdiction

05:24.976 --> 05:26.456
of NCIS."

05:26.500 --> 05:28.589
Once again. Say that slowly
so I can type it.

05:28.632 --> 05:30.330
Are you sure this is
the best route, Leon?

05:30.373 --> 05:33.550
You said it yourself--
murder of a veteran off-base.

05:33.594 --> 05:34.812
It's not our case.

05:34.856 --> 05:36.597
Sure, but what
about principle?

05:36.640 --> 05:38.381
Is that even a thing anymore?

05:38.425 --> 05:41.558
I did some digging
on the daughter,

05:41.602 --> 05:42.907
Sara Carter.

05:42.951 --> 05:44.822
Not only was her mom a vet,

05:44.866 --> 05:47.912
so was her grandmother,
and so is Sara.

05:47.956 --> 05:52.090
She was an individual
augmentee in Afghanistan.

05:52.134 --> 05:54.005
Recipient of the Purple Heart.

05:54.049 --> 05:55.572
She suffered
a broken clavicle

05:55.616 --> 05:57.095
and a traumatic
brain injury

05:57.139 --> 05:58.575
from a roadside bomb.

05:58.619 --> 06:02.144
A kindred spirit,
but still it's not our case.

06:02.187 --> 06:04.189
Taking the case, Leon.

06:04.233 --> 06:05.669
Gibbs, come on in.

06:05.713 --> 06:07.932
Police had their shot.

06:07.976 --> 06:10.021
We've got more resources.
We've got a better team.

06:10.065 --> 06:11.893
And her mother,
I understand her

06:11.936 --> 06:13.416
without even reading
a report.

06:13.460 --> 06:15.940
Cell phone videos
of this gate incident

06:15.984 --> 06:17.115
have gone viral.

06:17.159 --> 06:19.335
People are gonna
scrutinize and demonize

06:19.379 --> 06:20.815
until Mae Carter's
killer is found.

06:20.858 --> 06:23.644
If we take this on, we could be
setting up this agency

06:23.687 --> 06:25.254
for a PR nightmare.

06:25.297 --> 06:26.516
We're not gonna fail, Leon.

06:37.875 --> 06:39.573
All right, I'll let them know.
Thanks.

06:39.616 --> 06:42.271
That was Detective Olson
from Virginia State PD.

06:42.314 --> 06:43.881
He's giving us
the Mae Carter case.

06:43.925 --> 06:45.666
You talk to him?Yeah. He sent over

06:45.709 --> 06:47.581
his electronic files
about 15 minutes ago.

06:47.624 --> 06:48.886
Yeah, he said he was
more than willing.

06:48.930 --> 06:50.279
He's pulling up
the evidence for us now.

06:50.322 --> 06:52.542
Why be so willing
to hand over a case?

06:52.586 --> 06:54.544
'Cause normal people like
to work less.

06:54.588 --> 06:56.938
We are not normal
people, Torres.

06:56.981 --> 06:58.505
Give me an update.
Let's go.

06:58.548 --> 07:01.290
As a master-at-arms/
command investigator,

07:01.333 --> 07:04.728
CPO Mae Carter handled
POWs during wartime

07:04.772 --> 07:07.252
and investigated
non-felony crimes during peace.

07:07.296 --> 07:08.471
BISHOP:
She retired at 38

07:08.515 --> 07:10.212
and started a second career
as an assistant

07:10.255 --> 07:13.389
parole officer in the Virginia
Department of Corrections.

07:13.433 --> 07:14.434
McGEE:
One year ago, she was

07:14.477 --> 07:15.739
shot and killed
in her home

07:15.783 --> 07:17.567
in what appeared to be
a robbery gone bad.

07:17.611 --> 07:19.569
Detective Olson said that
her house went into foreclosure

07:19.613 --> 07:20.875
right after that.

07:20.918 --> 07:22.746
TORRES: The new owner
tore it down to rebuild.

07:22.790 --> 07:24.531
Yeah, so no going back
to the crime scene.

07:24.574 --> 07:26.881
Suspects?One primary.

07:26.924 --> 07:28.143
A guy named Robert Flynn.

07:28.186 --> 07:30.319
BISHOP: He was convicted
of attempted burglary.

07:30.362 --> 07:32.713
That happened on the same block
a few days before the murder.

07:32.756 --> 07:34.541
Flynn served six months
for that crime,

07:34.584 --> 07:35.890
but there was never
enough evidence

07:35.933 --> 07:37.369
to charge him with the murder
of Mae Carter.

07:37.413 --> 07:39.459
Torres, coordinate with Olson.
Transfer of evidence.

07:39.502 --> 07:41.286
Bishop, loop in Abby.

07:41.330 --> 07:42.940
McGee, you and me.All right.

07:42.984 --> 07:44.507
Robert the robber.

07:44.551 --> 07:45.943
I already tracked down
his location

07:45.987 --> 07:47.467
for the rest
of the afternoon.

07:52.994 --> 07:55.779
FLYNN:
I'm telling you, it's true.

07:55.823 --> 07:57.041
I am going for
the easiest target

07:57.085 --> 07:58.565
every single time.

07:58.608 --> 08:00.262
Now, remember,
for somebody like me,

08:00.305 --> 08:01.785
it's all about
opportunity.

08:01.829 --> 08:03.526
So, keep your doors locked,

08:03.570 --> 08:05.006
keep your eyes open,

08:05.049 --> 08:08.139
and keep your valuables with you
at all times,

08:08.183 --> 08:09.314
or else I'm gonna be
stealing 'em

08:09.358 --> 08:10.533
as you walk out of this room.

08:12.100 --> 08:13.449
I'm kidding, of course.

08:13.493 --> 08:14.537
Thank you guys so much.

08:14.581 --> 08:15.886
That's all the time that I got.

08:15.930 --> 08:17.148
I really appreciate it.

08:17.192 --> 08:18.802
Keep it real.

08:20.325 --> 08:22.284
Mr. Flynn, NCIS.

08:22.327 --> 08:23.285
FLYNN:
Let me guess.

08:23.328 --> 08:24.852
You're here about Mae Carter?

08:24.895 --> 08:26.897
The daughter has
her 15 minutes,

08:26.941 --> 08:28.377
you got reporters
and the navy cops calling.

08:28.420 --> 08:29.857
But tell you what.

08:29.900 --> 08:32.555
See that beautiful lady
right there in the blue?

08:32.599 --> 08:34.252
I just gave her an interview.

08:34.296 --> 08:36.037
If I were you, I'd go
talk to her, ask her

08:36.080 --> 08:37.168
if you could see it.

08:37.212 --> 08:38.561
That way you could
save me some time,

08:38.605 --> 08:39.910
I could get all this cleaned up.
No.

08:39.954 --> 08:42.391
Okay. Somebody came in hot.

08:42.434 --> 08:43.435
But look,

08:43.479 --> 08:46.264
I was a burglar, not a murderer.

08:46.308 --> 08:49.485
And, as you can see,
now I'm neither-- I'm reformed.

08:49.529 --> 08:51.052
The judge forced you
to do these talks

08:51.095 --> 08:52.314
as part of your parole.

08:52.357 --> 08:53.881
And I'm embracing 'em, bro.

08:53.924 --> 08:55.622
Mae Carter.
Talk.

08:55.665 --> 08:58.015
Yeah, look, it was, um...

08:58.059 --> 08:59.321
it was the middle
of a heat wave.

08:59.364 --> 09:00.931
I didn't have air in my car,

09:00.975 --> 09:03.543
so I only ended up
casing her street

09:03.586 --> 09:04.718
for about an hour.

09:04.761 --> 09:06.110
I tried to hit a house
down the block,

09:06.154 --> 09:07.111
and I got caught.

09:07.155 --> 09:08.199
That's it.
That's as close

09:08.243 --> 09:09.331
as I ever got to Mae Carter.

09:09.374 --> 09:10.506
You never entered her house?

09:10.550 --> 09:12.552
Nah, man, she had
lawn ornaments.

09:12.595 --> 09:14.858
That means there ain't nothing
worth nothing in there.

09:14.902 --> 09:17.165
:
If you know what I mean.

09:17.208 --> 09:19.559
Yeah, yeah, I did, uh...

09:19.602 --> 09:21.125
I did hear some yelling, though.

09:21.169 --> 09:22.344
Coming from her house?

09:22.387 --> 09:25.129
Yeah, yeah.
I couldn't, uh...

09:25.173 --> 09:26.870
couldn't make out the words,

09:26.914 --> 09:28.959
but it sounded like a couple
of females

09:29.003 --> 09:31.527
who were pretty pissed off
at each other.

09:31.571 --> 09:33.311
You tell that to the detective
on the case?

09:33.355 --> 09:35.226
What, Olson?
Oh, yeah, yeah.

09:35.270 --> 09:37.707
Me and him go way back,
like car seats.

09:37.751 --> 09:39.579
We got a special bond.
He, uh...

09:39.622 --> 09:42.364
he's the first cop
that ever arrested me, so...

09:42.407 --> 09:44.584
Good luck, guys.

09:47.935 --> 09:49.545
Tell you what,
if I wasn't knee-deep

09:49.589 --> 09:51.242
in a triple homicide,
I'd buy you a drink

09:51.286 --> 09:53.418
for taking this beast
off my hands.

09:53.462 --> 09:54.724
Well, do you have
a minute to chat?

09:54.768 --> 09:57.074
Uh, 30 seconds
would be better.

09:57.118 --> 09:59.424
Robert Flynn.
You like him for this?

09:59.468 --> 10:01.862
At first, yeah.

10:01.905 --> 10:04.386
But I could never
find anything solid

10:04.429 --> 10:05.561
tying him to the murder.

10:05.605 --> 10:06.736
And the Carter place was tossed.

10:06.780 --> 10:08.172
No valuables were taken.

10:08.216 --> 10:09.565
You think it was staged?

10:09.609 --> 10:11.001
The victim could have been
the target all along.

10:11.045 --> 10:13.613
I went down that road,
hit a dead end.

10:13.656 --> 10:14.614
And when I followed up
on the fight

10:14.657 --> 10:15.919
that Flynn told me about,

10:15.963 --> 10:17.921
three neighbors confirmed
there was arguing

10:17.965 --> 10:19.531
the entire week
leading up to the murder.

10:19.575 --> 10:20.663
Arguing between who?

10:20.707 --> 10:22.186
Between Mae Carter
and her daughter.

10:22.230 --> 10:23.623
Sara?
Yeah.

10:23.666 --> 10:25.363
She admitted to living
with her mother at the time,

10:25.407 --> 10:26.626
but she claims
she can't remember

10:26.669 --> 10:28.236
what the fights were about.Hard to believe.

10:28.279 --> 10:29.716
Well, when I first
got this case,

10:29.759 --> 10:33.633
I felt like I was staring
into a can of worms.

10:33.676 --> 10:36.766
The only person I ever
found that had a true beef

10:36.810 --> 10:38.463
with Mae Carter
was her daughter.

10:38.507 --> 10:41.249
All right, we'll be in touch.

10:41.292 --> 10:44.861
Yeah, you know
where to find me.

10:44.905 --> 10:46.384
ABBY:
Okay, let's see

10:46.428 --> 10:48.343
what's in this one.

10:50.954 --> 10:53.565
The bullets
that killed Mae Carter.

10:53.609 --> 10:55.524
A pair
of nine millimeters, check.

10:55.567 --> 10:58.309
And the clothes she was
wearing when she was murdered.

10:58.353 --> 10:59.963
Yep, they're all here.

11:00.007 --> 11:01.965
JIMMY: Did you guys see
these crime scene photos?

11:02.009 --> 11:04.968
See, the-the autopsy report said
that Mae fell onto her stomach

11:05.012 --> 11:07.710
when she was shot, but the
police report said she was found

11:07.754 --> 11:08.798
on her side.

11:08.842 --> 11:10.321
Why would the killer
have moved her?

11:11.409 --> 11:13.107
Is the answer
coming in already?

11:15.892 --> 11:17.720
What? I just got an e-mail

11:17.764 --> 11:19.591
saying that I was
randomly selected

11:19.635 --> 11:21.071
to have dinner for two

11:21.115 --> 11:23.073
at The Cooler this weekend.

11:23.117 --> 11:24.161
Yes! I'm in.

11:24.205 --> 11:25.685
What? No, no, no.

11:25.728 --> 11:27.512
I-I already know
what I'm gonna order.

11:27.556 --> 11:30.385
They serve this gourmet soup,
and there is

11:30.428 --> 11:33.170
this pumpkin chowder, Abbs,
that is supposed to be amazing.

11:33.214 --> 11:36.870
You know, I think I might
give it to Al, the janitor.

11:36.913 --> 11:38.349
His wife's been in the hospital,

11:38.393 --> 11:40.221
and they could probably use
a pick-me-up.

11:40.264 --> 11:42.049
No joke, Abby,

11:42.092 --> 11:45.226
you are like an angel in
platform shoes, you know that?

11:45.269 --> 11:48.708
Oh, oh, hey, it says here that
this offer is non-transferrable.

11:48.751 --> 11:51.101
That means, Abby,
you have to go.

11:51.145 --> 11:52.624
You have to take
one of us with you.

11:52.668 --> 11:53.713
Well, you can leave me
out of it.

11:53.756 --> 11:55.149
I don't really fancy soup.

11:55.192 --> 11:58.195
Hey, Abbs. Ladies'
night in an igloo?

11:58.239 --> 11:59.980
Huh?

12:00.023 --> 12:02.156
Wait a minute.
Guys, look at this.

12:02.199 --> 12:05.637
They're credit card bills,
all in Sara Carter's name,

12:05.681 --> 12:07.291
and they're all past due.

12:07.335 --> 12:10.381
So, she was fighting
with her mother,

12:10.425 --> 12:13.036
and thousands of
dollars in debt.

12:13.080 --> 12:15.038
Failed to mention it
to any of us.

12:15.082 --> 12:16.300
Think she was hiding something?

12:16.344 --> 12:17.519
One way to find out.

12:17.562 --> 12:19.477
I'll send you her address?

12:20.652 --> 12:23.046
All right, picture this:

12:23.090 --> 12:26.484
you and me,
subterranean coworkers

12:26.528 --> 12:29.792
dining on ice chairs.

12:29.836 --> 12:33.187
It feels so right.

12:37.626 --> 12:39.671
That's not her name. You sure
this is the right house?

12:39.715 --> 12:43.023
Well, it has to be.
This is the address she gave us.

12:58.168 --> 12:59.648
Hey, there she is.

13:08.135 --> 13:10.790
Ms. Carter.

13:12.487 --> 13:13.923
Who are you?

13:13.967 --> 13:15.577
NCIS.

13:15.620 --> 13:16.926
Oh, you're working
with Agent Gibbs?

13:16.970 --> 13:18.449
Yes.Did you find
something?

13:18.493 --> 13:19.755
Do you have a suspect?

13:19.799 --> 13:20.843
Actually want to ask
you a few questions,

13:20.887 --> 13:22.497
if you don't mind
coming with us.

13:22.540 --> 13:23.977
Yeah, I mind, I've got my kid.

13:27.284 --> 13:28.677
Look, some issues
have come up,

13:28.720 --> 13:29.939
and we need some clarification.

13:29.983 --> 13:31.158
Well, can it wait
until tomorrow

13:31.201 --> 13:32.333
when he's in school?

13:32.376 --> 13:34.248
Uh, no, it can't.

13:35.684 --> 13:38.121
Where are you going, Sara?

13:38.165 --> 13:39.819
I'm not going anywhere.

13:42.865 --> 13:44.693
Your car is packed.

13:46.173 --> 13:48.305
You were fighting with your
mother before she was killed,

13:48.349 --> 13:50.133
and now you're about
to skip town?

13:50.177 --> 13:52.353
I said I'm not going anywhere.

13:53.876 --> 13:55.835
This is everything you have,
isn't it?

13:57.271 --> 13:59.099
Your mother's house

13:59.142 --> 14:01.318
went into foreclosure, and...

14:02.929 --> 14:05.496
...this car's
where you've been living.

14:20.990 --> 14:23.863
Thank you. Hey, Leon.

14:23.906 --> 14:26.909
I just got off the phone with
a reporter named Diane Boyle.

14:26.953 --> 14:29.433
She's the newest member
of this TV news magazine,

14:29.477 --> 14:31.087
Profile 360.

14:31.131 --> 14:33.742
Yeah. Saw her when we went
to question Robert Flynn.

14:33.785 --> 14:36.005
She's doing a piece on the case?Mm-hmm.

14:36.049 --> 14:37.789
She's turning over
every rock she can find

14:37.833 --> 14:40.227
on the murder
of Mae Carter. In fact,

14:40.270 --> 14:42.577
she's got witnesses saying
that NCIS was hostile

14:42.620 --> 14:43.883
with Mae's daughter
in the street.

14:43.926 --> 14:45.449
Hey, Leon,

14:45.493 --> 14:46.886
I don't care what kind
of BS she's got.

14:46.929 --> 14:48.496
My only concern is justice

14:48.539 --> 14:50.063
for Mae Carter, that's it.

14:50.106 --> 14:52.500
Bear in mind, Gibbs,
when the world is watching,

14:52.543 --> 14:54.719
"no comment"
can only play for so long.

14:54.763 --> 14:56.504
Okay, guys, you're both right.

14:56.547 --> 14:58.071
Can we just please move on?

14:58.114 --> 15:00.073
The daughter, Sara Carter.

15:00.116 --> 15:03.598
That address she gave
us, it's not hers.

15:03.641 --> 15:06.209
The family that lives there
lets her use their shower.

15:06.253 --> 15:07.776
SLOANE:
The traumatic brain injury

15:07.819 --> 15:09.169
that Sara suffered
in Afghanistan

15:09.212 --> 15:10.387
resulted in migraines

15:10.431 --> 15:11.736
and trouble
concentrating.

15:11.780 --> 15:13.434
Hard to hold down a job.

15:13.477 --> 15:14.957
SLOANE: Which contributed
to her homelessness.

15:15.001 --> 15:17.525
This is not a unique case,
as we all know.

15:17.568 --> 15:19.092
Yeah. I know the numbers.

15:19.135 --> 15:21.355
The-the numbers are wrong, Leon,

15:21.398 --> 15:22.878
that's the point.

15:22.922 --> 15:24.880
Women are the fastest
growing segment

15:24.924 --> 15:27.013
of the homeless vet population.

15:27.056 --> 15:28.753
And-and women aren't
the vets that are standing

15:28.797 --> 15:29.972
on the side
of the road

15:30.016 --> 15:31.452
with a cardboard sign.

15:31.495 --> 15:33.280
They don't live in the streets
or shelters.

15:33.323 --> 15:35.630
It is safer to sleep in a car
or on someone's couch

15:35.673 --> 15:36.718
if you have kids.

15:36.761 --> 15:37.937
Exactly.

15:37.980 --> 15:39.112
It's like they're invisible.

15:39.155 --> 15:40.635
They're not even counted.

15:40.678 --> 15:43.246
So there are not enough
resources to help, I know.

15:43.290 --> 15:45.205
But our case isunique,
Agent Sloane.

15:45.248 --> 15:46.989
Living situation aside,

15:47.033 --> 15:48.817
Sara Carter is looking
like a suspect.

15:48.860 --> 15:50.384
Does the TBI affect her memory?

15:50.427 --> 15:52.821
Nothing in her charts
would suggest that, no.

15:52.864 --> 15:55.128
So there's no way she can't
recall a week-long argument

15:55.171 --> 15:56.781
leading up to the murder
of her mother.

15:58.522 --> 16:01.177
Find out what she's hiding.

16:06.400 --> 16:08.010
Sara Carter is waiting
in the conference room.

16:08.054 --> 16:10.404
I'll get her son settled
somewhere and meet you in there.

16:10.447 --> 16:11.709
I'd like to go with you
to talk to her.

16:11.753 --> 16:13.146
Too many people, her
guard will go up.

16:13.189 --> 16:14.190
Gibbs, we're not done here!

16:14.234 --> 16:16.758
Hey. That's not
your call to make.

16:16.801 --> 16:20.370
You know about the volunteer
work I've been doing.

16:20.414 --> 16:22.198
Yeah. Charity for homeless vets.

16:22.242 --> 16:23.504
Let me talk to Sara.

16:23.547 --> 16:26.202
I can benefit
this investigation.

16:28.291 --> 16:30.032
Okay, Reeves, you take my place.

16:30.076 --> 16:31.251
Thank you.

16:31.294 --> 16:33.209
You report back to me.

16:36.299 --> 16:37.474
Where'd they take Theo?

16:40.564 --> 16:42.697
Uh, he's just down the hall
with Agent Bishop.

16:42.740 --> 16:43.915
Please, have a seat.

16:46.005 --> 16:47.919
I don't know
what you want from me.

16:47.963 --> 16:50.705
Uh, do you remember stuff
you said a year ago?

16:50.748 --> 16:54.970
If it was one of the last things
I said to my mom, yeah.

16:56.537 --> 16:58.843
Sara, we know that
you were in debt.

16:58.887 --> 17:02.282
Did you ask
your mom for money?

17:02.325 --> 17:05.676
The sooner you talk to us, the
sooner you and your son can go.

17:09.028 --> 17:11.813
I-I didn't want my mom
to bail me out.

17:11.856 --> 17:13.771
Uh, she loved
taking pictures.

17:13.815 --> 17:18.254
So she cashed in her 401K
to start a photography studio.

17:19.603 --> 17:21.562
When she found out
how much I owed,

17:21.605 --> 17:24.826
she used the money
to pay for my bills instead.

17:26.697 --> 17:28.569
So that's why you were arguing.

17:28.612 --> 17:29.787
Yeah.

17:29.831 --> 17:31.615
Why didn't you tell
Detective Olson?

17:31.659 --> 17:33.791
I was ashamed.

17:35.619 --> 17:36.838
And it had nothing to do
with her murder anyway.

17:36.881 --> 17:38.144
I mean, that detective

17:38.187 --> 17:40.146
was looking in all
the wrong places.

17:40.189 --> 17:42.974
And so you came to us
because you wanted

17:43.018 --> 17:45.586
to take care of your mom
the way she took care of you.

17:45.629 --> 17:48.023
She did more than that.

17:48.067 --> 17:51.113
She took care of Theo.

17:51.157 --> 17:55.378
When I deployed,
she kept my baby safe and fed,

17:55.422 --> 17:57.380
she sang to him,

17:57.424 --> 18:00.253
she let him know he was loved,

18:00.296 --> 18:02.081
so I could complete
my mission.

18:02.124 --> 18:03.778
You know, she did
that for me.

18:03.821 --> 18:07.564
Now I'm going to do this
for her.

18:10.654 --> 18:13.222
Sara,

18:13.266 --> 18:16.225
you can't help anybody
if you don't help yourself.

18:16.269 --> 18:19.098
There's an organization
called Final Salute.

18:19.141 --> 18:20.795
And they have
a house

18:20.838 --> 18:22.623
for female vets and their kids.

18:22.666 --> 18:23.928
Look, I already told you...

18:23.972 --> 18:25.147
You could stay there

18:25.191 --> 18:26.279
until you get back on your feet.

18:26.322 --> 18:27.932
We're not homeless.

18:27.976 --> 18:29.804
Okay? As soon as this is over,

18:29.847 --> 18:32.633
Theo and I are gonna go live
with my aunt in Texas, okay?

18:35.723 --> 18:37.768
It's pre-paid.

18:37.812 --> 18:39.335
I've programmed in
my number.

18:39.379 --> 18:40.815
Just in case
you change your mind.

18:40.858 --> 18:43.122
Can we go get Theo now?

18:43.165 --> 18:44.949
Absolutely.

19:02.141 --> 19:04.099
McGEE:
Morning, Abby.

19:04.143 --> 19:06.188
Get ready, 'cause I've
got a surprise for you.

19:06.232 --> 19:07.581
Is it something to keep me warm

19:07.624 --> 19:09.887
while I'm having dinner
at The Cooler?

19:09.931 --> 19:11.062
Faux-fur skull earmuffs,
check 'em out.

19:11.106 --> 19:12.368
Thank you.

19:12.412 --> 19:14.283
You can put them here
on the table

19:14.327 --> 19:15.806
with the scarf from Torres

19:15.850 --> 19:17.852
and the leg warmers from Bishop

19:17.895 --> 19:19.854
and the soup spoon from Jimmy.

19:19.897 --> 19:21.290
Have you picked a plus one yet?

19:21.334 --> 19:23.858
No. I just want to make sure
that I choose the person

19:23.901 --> 19:25.251
who really deserves

19:25.294 --> 19:27.427
a fantastic night.

19:27.470 --> 19:29.385
Abby, I have known
and adored you longer

19:29.429 --> 19:30.604
than any of these people.

19:30.647 --> 19:32.475
I know, McGee.

19:32.519 --> 19:35.826
And I'm factoring that into
my dinner companion algorithm.

19:35.870 --> 19:36.827
Okay.

19:36.871 --> 19:38.829
Meanwhile, I found out

19:38.873 --> 19:40.570
why Mae's body was moved.

19:40.614 --> 19:42.790
She was turned onto her side
so the killer could

19:42.833 --> 19:44.357
get something out
of her front pocket.

19:44.400 --> 19:45.967
These the jeans
she was wearing?

19:46.010 --> 19:48.970
Yes. And I found
traces of paper here.

19:49.013 --> 19:50.145
McGEE:
What are those markings?

19:50.189 --> 19:51.233
Carbon black dye

19:51.277 --> 19:53.017
number 28.

19:53.061 --> 19:55.629
Because of the extreme heat
we were having,

19:55.672 --> 19:57.500
some of the ink
from the paper transferred

19:57.544 --> 19:59.285
onto the inside of the pocket.

19:59.328 --> 20:01.112
And you enhanced it.

20:01.156 --> 20:04.115
ABBY: Enhanced it,
unscrambled it and flipped it,

20:04.159 --> 20:06.030
and I could see that it's a list

20:06.074 --> 20:07.597
of alphanumeric characters,

20:07.641 --> 20:09.904
all beginning
with the letters "GC."

20:09.947 --> 20:10.818
Which means...?

20:10.861 --> 20:12.254
They're tracking numbers

20:12.298 --> 20:14.952
from a shipping company
called Global Courier.

20:14.996 --> 20:16.084
It's possible the killer
was looking

20:16.127 --> 20:17.477
for some kind of package.

20:17.520 --> 20:19.305
Were you able to find
any full numbers?

20:19.348 --> 20:21.220
I got one, and I
texted it to you.

20:21.263 --> 20:23.091
Wow, thanks, Abbs.

20:23.134 --> 20:24.745
By the way, those earmuffs?

20:24.788 --> 20:25.833
Velvet lined.

20:31.926 --> 20:34.842
WOMAN :
We need a forklift
at the loading dock, please.

20:34.885 --> 20:37.540
Yep, this is definitely one
of our tracking numbers.

20:37.584 --> 20:38.846
What was it for?

20:38.889 --> 20:40.456
We don't know
the contents,

20:40.500 --> 20:43.459
but it was
a six-by-nine envelope bag

20:43.503 --> 20:45.592
sent from Veteran Alpha Care.

20:45.635 --> 20:46.810
The mail order pharmacy.

20:46.854 --> 20:48.029
Yeah, that's the one.

20:48.072 --> 20:50.379
Let me see.

20:50.423 --> 20:53.077
The recipient was Earl Kraft
in Arlington.

20:53.121 --> 20:54.427
Package was delivered?

20:54.470 --> 20:55.732
February of last year.

20:55.776 --> 20:57.299
No, I take that back.

20:57.343 --> 20:59.432
It was initially marked
as delivered, but the recipient

20:59.475 --> 21:01.303
later reported
it stolen.

21:01.347 --> 21:02.913
Earl...?Earl Kraft.

21:02.957 --> 21:05.264
I can write down his address,
if that helps.

21:06.395 --> 21:08.397
Boss?

21:08.441 --> 21:10.051
Hey.

21:10.094 --> 21:12.140
You following us?Start rolling.

21:12.183 --> 21:13.620
You're with NCIS...I asked you a question.

21:13.663 --> 21:14.795
My name is Diane Boyle,
and we're here...

21:14.838 --> 21:16.449
Yeah, yeah,
I know who you are.

21:16.492 --> 21:17.754
Put that away.How do you
respond to claims

21:17.798 --> 21:19.234
that your agency was mistreating

21:19.278 --> 21:20.975
the victim's daughter

21:21.018 --> 21:23.151
I said put it down!

21:23.194 --> 21:25.545
Do you have any new suspects
on the murder of Mae Carter?

21:25.588 --> 21:27.242
Mr. Gunderson, do these people
have your permission

21:27.286 --> 21:29.810
to be on the property?

21:29.853 --> 21:32.334
N-No, they do not.

21:32.378 --> 21:33.988
I'm not gonna ask you again.

21:34.031 --> 21:35.946
All right, let's go-- okay.Get out of here.

21:38.166 --> 21:40.473
BISHOP:
Earl Kraft

21:40.516 --> 21:43.345
is an Army vet who was receiving
prescription painkillers

21:43.389 --> 21:46.087
from a mail order V.A. pharmacy.

21:46.130 --> 21:47.480
Did you talk to him?

21:47.523 --> 21:49.351
He died of a heart attack
about two months ago.

21:49.395 --> 21:51.222
According to the report he
filed, he believed his pills

21:51.266 --> 21:52.398
were stolen out of his mailbox.

21:52.441 --> 21:54.051
Give me a timeline.

21:54.095 --> 21:57.490
Theft happened a month
before Mae Carter was murdered.

21:57.533 --> 21:59.013
So it's possible
she got his tracking number

21:59.056 --> 22:00.536
and stole his pills.

22:00.580 --> 22:01.537
TORRES: It's funny, that
picture makes her look

22:01.581 --> 22:03.365
like a good citizen, but...

22:03.409 --> 22:05.846
Well, original case file shows
that she used her credit card

22:05.889 --> 22:08.196
to buy gas a few hours
before she died.

22:08.239 --> 22:10.938
That gas station
is in a bad neighborhood.

22:10.981 --> 22:12.853
We're talking
about Mad Maxbad.

22:12.896 --> 22:15.203
Hey, you talking about
the gas station bit?

22:15.246 --> 22:17.031
Yeah.

22:17.074 --> 22:18.859
Well, for that,
I have something.

22:18.902 --> 22:19.903
Traffic cam footage.

22:19.947 --> 22:21.557
You got to come closer, bro.

22:21.601 --> 22:23.690
No, Torres, your massive
head is... it's in the way.

22:23.733 --> 22:25.605
Can you just...? Thank you.

22:25.648 --> 22:27.389
The traffic cam
only took a picture

22:27.433 --> 22:29.696
because the car in front was
speeding through a red light.

22:30.914 --> 22:32.307
That's Mae's car in back,

22:32.351 --> 22:33.961
parked half a mile
from the gas station.

22:34.004 --> 22:35.092
We don't know how long
she stayed,

22:35.136 --> 22:36.093
we don't know where she went.

22:36.137 --> 22:37.617
Anything else in the area?

22:37.660 --> 22:39.401
There's a hostel on the
corner, and that's it, really.

22:39.445 --> 22:40.533
Why would she have stopped there

22:40.576 --> 22:41.708
the day she was murdered?

22:41.751 --> 22:43.753
Torres, Reeves, go.

22:43.797 --> 22:46.321
Bishop, other traffic cams.

22:46.365 --> 22:48.802
McGee, get Detective
Olson on the phone.

22:48.845 --> 22:52.066
Find out if any of this
means anything to him.

22:52.109 --> 22:55.852
They put me on hold for, like,
an hour, and then they tell me

22:55.896 --> 22:57.854
that I can't get a table
till next year.

22:57.898 --> 22:59.465
But Abby's got to
take me, right?

22:59.508 --> 23:01.597
I mean, I deserve
a fantastic night.

23:01.641 --> 23:03.730
Yeah, I'm sure you do, mate.

23:03.773 --> 23:05.558
What's your problem?

23:05.601 --> 23:07.168
What's my problem?

23:07.211 --> 23:09.953
Sara Carter doesn't have
an aunt who lives in Texas.

23:09.997 --> 23:11.607
I've seen this a dozen times.

23:11.651 --> 23:13.827
She needs help, but she's
scared that if she admits

23:13.870 --> 23:16.873
she's homeless, they'll take
her son away from her.

23:16.917 --> 23:18.875
That's heavy, man.

23:18.919 --> 23:20.486
Yeah.

23:20.529 --> 23:22.792
You know, I have
heavy thoughts, too.

23:22.836 --> 23:24.446
Weightlifting fantasies
don't count, mate.

23:24.490 --> 23:26.666
They don't?

23:30.496 --> 23:32.672
Hey. NCIS.

23:32.715 --> 23:34.456
You, too?

23:34.500 --> 23:37.328
I'm MI6, actually.MI6.

23:37.372 --> 23:39.940
That's dope, dude, you got
the accent and everything.

23:39.983 --> 23:41.898
All right, all right.

23:41.942 --> 23:43.465
You recognize her?

23:43.509 --> 23:45.075
Hmm, no.

23:45.119 --> 23:46.468
Why, should I?

23:46.512 --> 23:48.949
About a year ago,
she was in the neighborhood,

23:48.992 --> 23:50.951
parked on the corner.

23:50.994 --> 23:53.083
Well, that's kind of a stretch,
isn't it?

23:53.127 --> 23:54.433
TORRES:
Listen,

23:54.476 --> 23:55.956
how many beds
you have open tonight?

23:55.999 --> 23:57.610
Uh, I don't really do math.

23:57.653 --> 23:59.568
I just give people a bed
if I got one.

23:59.612 --> 24:02.136
Perfect. Then you won't mind
if we have a look around?

24:02.179 --> 24:04.530
No, do your thing.

24:05.661 --> 24:06.836
I got this!

24:06.880 --> 24:07.924
No, I got this!

24:11.362 --> 24:13.756
Hey!

24:15.802 --> 24:17.020
Come on.

24:17.064 --> 24:18.544
Go back, Clay,
I'm faster than you.

24:20.894 --> 24:22.243
MAN:
Hey!

24:22.286 --> 24:24.637
REEVES: Get over yourself,
bruv, I'm just jogging.

24:24.680 --> 24:27.030
TORRES:
How funny, so am I.

24:37.650 --> 24:38.825
Nick, out my bloody way!

24:38.868 --> 24:41.131
Really?

24:48.704 --> 24:49.531
Clay, stop!

24:51.838 --> 24:54.536
WOMAN:
Oh, my God.

25:04.546 --> 25:06.417
Name was Jax Wesley.

25:06.461 --> 25:08.289
He owned the hostel?
Yeah.

25:08.332 --> 25:09.986
TORRES: This guy must've
had a lot of practice

25:10.030 --> 25:11.335
running away from cops.

25:11.379 --> 25:12.641
He was quick.

25:12.685 --> 25:13.990
What about the
woman who hit him?

25:14.034 --> 25:15.992
She was lucky.

25:16.036 --> 25:17.559
Just a few
scratches.

25:17.603 --> 25:19.474
Wrong time, wrong place.Hmm.

25:19.518 --> 25:21.041
Could happen to the best of us.

25:21.084 --> 25:21.955
Yep.

25:23.434 --> 25:25.001
You know what? This body
needs to be covered.

25:25.045 --> 25:27.003
I'm gonna text Jimmy,
see how far away he is.

25:27.047 --> 25:28.701
Copy.

25:28.744 --> 25:29.876
Hey.

25:29.919 --> 25:31.442
Yo.
You all right, man?

25:31.486 --> 25:33.096
Yeah.

25:33.140 --> 25:35.403
You know, you never want
to see these things happen,

25:35.446 --> 25:36.970
even if the guy's
running away from you.

25:37.013 --> 25:38.188
Listen.

25:39.320 --> 25:40.582
You pulled me back

25:40.626 --> 25:41.888
when that truck hit.

25:41.931 --> 25:43.803
What?

25:43.846 --> 25:45.979
You think I was trying
to save your life?

25:46.022 --> 25:48.721
What, you weren't?

25:48.764 --> 25:52.072
No, man, I just-- I just can't
stand seeing you ahead of me.

25:55.684 --> 25:57.773
Oh, hey, and, Reeves?

25:57.817 --> 26:01.908
The only reason why you won
is because I pulled my hammy.

26:08.958 --> 26:11.918
So, what are we looking for?

26:11.961 --> 26:14.921
Well, Reeves said, once
they headed behind the desk,

26:14.964 --> 26:16.487
the guy ran.

26:18.707 --> 26:21.231
Hollow?
Mm-hmm.

26:24.887 --> 26:26.541
GIBBS:
Or you could push right here.

26:26.585 --> 26:27.629
My bad.

26:29.588 --> 26:31.677
This is more than a hostel.

26:31.720 --> 26:33.374
BISHOP:
Yeah, one-stop shop

26:33.417 --> 26:35.028
for all your illegal
prescription drug needs.

26:35.071 --> 26:36.638
Nine-mill.

26:36.682 --> 26:39.641
Same as the bullets
used to kill Mae Carter.

26:39.685 --> 26:40.860
Get it to Abby for ballistics.

26:40.903 --> 26:42.426
OLSON:
Agent Gibbs?Yeah.

26:42.470 --> 26:43.558
Detective Olson.

26:43.602 --> 26:44.864
Nice to meet you in person.

26:44.907 --> 26:46.387
Yeah. Same.

26:46.430 --> 26:47.910
Torres caught me up to speed.

26:47.954 --> 26:50.565
I ran the name Jax Wesley
through our system.

26:50.609 --> 26:52.045
Narcotics had a file on him.

26:52.088 --> 26:53.916
Find any prescription
drugs here?

26:53.960 --> 26:55.135
Oh, yeah.

26:55.178 --> 26:56.615
Wow.

26:56.658 --> 26:58.573
The guy wasn't kidding around.

26:58.617 --> 27:01.054
Narcotics was onto him
for the last two months,

27:01.097 --> 27:03.491
but they were keeping their
distance, trying to get an ID

27:03.534 --> 27:04.753
on his supplier.

27:04.797 --> 27:06.712
They come up with anything?No.

27:06.755 --> 27:08.757
You think his supplier
could've been Mae Carter?

27:08.801 --> 27:10.106
From me?

27:10.150 --> 27:11.630
She doesn't seem the type.

27:11.673 --> 27:13.414
Well, as far
as I can see,

27:13.457 --> 27:15.895
the tracking numbers
you found in Mae Carter's pocket

27:15.938 --> 27:18.506
could've been pills she stole,
brought here to sell.

27:18.549 --> 27:21.248
Or, possible,

27:21.291 --> 27:23.467
she was coming here to buy more.

27:29.212 --> 27:31.737
That's not my mom.

27:32.955 --> 27:35.131
She wasn't stealing
anyone's pills.

27:35.175 --> 27:36.785
She wouldn't steal anything.

27:36.829 --> 27:39.440
We took this case out of
respect for your mother.

27:39.483 --> 27:41.311
That hasn't changed.

27:41.355 --> 27:43.705
SLOANE:
Sara, we looked into her past.

27:43.749 --> 27:45.707
In 1998, she was hospitalized.

27:45.751 --> 27:48.144
She overdosed
on antidepressants.

27:48.188 --> 27:52.366
Yeah, my father couldn't handle
her being away on deployment.

27:52.409 --> 27:54.020
He left us.

27:54.063 --> 27:55.978
We're not judging her, Sara.No.

27:56.022 --> 27:57.501
You're accusing her.

27:58.807 --> 28:01.505
Desert Storm,

28:01.549 --> 28:04.465
guys were always looking
for trophies

28:04.508 --> 28:05.771
to smuggle back.

28:05.814 --> 28:07.250
Weapons, knives.

28:07.294 --> 28:09.470
I took a can
of Iraqi shoe polish.

28:11.080 --> 28:16.346
Made me think that we all...
polish our boots the same way.

28:16.390 --> 28:21.525
Me... the enemy...
the guy next to me.

28:21.569 --> 28:22.701
So what?

28:22.744 --> 28:24.964
And your mother, too.

28:25.007 --> 28:27.227
Oh, you think you know
my mom because,

28:27.270 --> 28:28.445
what, we're all the same?

28:28.489 --> 28:29.533
No.

28:29.577 --> 28:30.752
Not the same.

28:31.971 --> 28:33.059
We're all human.

28:33.102 --> 28:35.061
When she got out
of that hospital,

28:35.104 --> 28:36.627
she picked herself up

28:36.671 --> 28:38.412
and went straight
to rehab.

28:38.455 --> 28:41.415
Okay? My mother was not
stealing anything.

28:42.982 --> 28:44.331
And she damn sure

28:44.374 --> 28:45.724
wasn't taking anything either.

28:45.767 --> 28:48.857
She stayed sober
until the day she died.

28:48.901 --> 28:50.816
Wait, wait.
Excuse me, Sara, Sara?

28:50.859 --> 28:52.295
Wait, wait, wait.

28:52.339 --> 28:54.167
At least take
some food for Theo.

28:54.210 --> 28:56.778
Look, I'm late.

28:56.822 --> 28:58.649
I got to pick him up
from school.

28:58.693 --> 28:59.999
Please.

29:00.042 --> 29:03.742
You said you were going
to do right by my mom.

29:06.396 --> 29:09.138
Now all you're doing
is dragging her through the mud.

29:16.276 --> 29:18.713
DIANE:
Next week, on Profile 360,

29:18.757 --> 29:22.195
Sara Carter packed up her life,
putting off a cross-country move

29:22.238 --> 29:24.414
to find justice for her mother.

29:26.242 --> 29:28.027
My mom loved taking photos.

29:28.070 --> 29:30.986
Look, I'm only talking to you
so people know she mattered.

29:31.030 --> 29:34.511
Okay? So they can't just throw
her to the side.

29:34.555 --> 29:36.513
DIANE: We'll take you
through all the drama.

29:36.557 --> 29:38.559
I said, put it down!

29:38.602 --> 29:40.430
DIANE: Okay. All right.
All right, let's go.GIBBS: Get out of here!

29:40.474 --> 29:42.563
Camera adds ten pounds
to his temper.

29:42.606 --> 29:43.782
You want to make it 20?

29:43.825 --> 29:45.044
Gibbs!

29:45.087 --> 29:46.393
:
God, he's really quiet.

29:46.436 --> 29:47.829
DIANE:
All that and more next week...

29:47.873 --> 29:49.831
So glad you're here.

29:49.875 --> 29:52.051
Take a peek here at Jax Wesley.

29:52.094 --> 29:54.618
Now, what you're looking at

29:54.662 --> 29:56.620
are massive injuries
from the truck hit.

29:58.100 --> 29:59.275
That it?

29:59.319 --> 30:01.060
It's Abby. Ballistics came back.

30:01.103 --> 30:02.583
Jax's gun was
the one used

30:02.626 --> 30:04.193
to kill Mae Carter.

30:04.237 --> 30:05.934
Well, we've got
our killer right here.

30:05.978 --> 30:08.458
Mae Carter,
what about her tox screen?

30:09.808 --> 30:11.461
Police dropped the ball.

30:11.505 --> 30:13.855
They never did one on Mae
the time of the murder.

30:15.117 --> 30:16.292
So, if she had relapsed,

30:16.336 --> 30:17.772
we'll never know for sure.

30:17.816 --> 30:18.904
:
Yeah.

30:20.296 --> 30:24.083
Ladies and gentlemen,
are you ready?

30:24.126 --> 30:27.303
Made from scratch with our own
brilliant hands, of course,

30:27.347 --> 30:29.784
say hello to the monster pizzas.

30:36.312 --> 30:38.967
WOMAN:
Well, make sure you save
yourself a piece.

30:39.011 --> 30:41.491
It's called the Final Salute
HOME program.

30:41.535 --> 30:45.756
All the residents are homeless
women vets and their kids.

30:45.800 --> 30:49.630
So, this is what you were
collecting donations for?

30:49.673 --> 30:51.240
Yeah.

30:51.284 --> 30:52.676
Started volunteering

30:52.720 --> 30:54.026
as part of my recovery.

30:54.069 --> 30:56.985
See, a difference
between me and Sara,

30:57.029 --> 30:59.161
she has a load
of pictures of her mom.

30:59.205 --> 31:02.469
And, uh, I've only got the one.

31:02.512 --> 31:04.384
Aw, is that you?

31:04.427 --> 31:06.038
I was three years old
when she died.

31:07.909 --> 31:10.129
One of the only things
I know about her

31:10.172 --> 31:11.652
is that
she was homeless.

31:11.695 --> 31:14.220
Well, we were homeless together.

31:14.263 --> 31:17.832
So you volunteer to honor her.

31:17.876 --> 31:22.924
Yeah, it's like, uh, when I'm
here, I can see her, in a way.

31:22.968 --> 31:26.754
And I figured, when I'm retired,

31:26.797 --> 31:29.191
I'd start a charity of my
own and name it after her.

31:29.235 --> 31:32.238
But I think my, uh,
volunteer work is best kept

31:32.281 --> 31:33.674
to making pizza.

31:33.717 --> 31:35.415
Why?

31:35.458 --> 31:39.288
Because Sara didn't
accept your help?

31:39.332 --> 31:42.248
I mean, you can't
give up on her.

31:42.291 --> 31:45.164
I'm not. That's why I wanted you
to see this place,

31:45.207 --> 31:47.079
so you could talk to her.

31:47.122 --> 31:50.604
Me?Abby, you've got the biggest
heart I've ever seen.

31:50.647 --> 31:52.954
If anyone can convince Sara
to take help, it's you.

31:52.998 --> 31:54.477
I'm not doing it.

31:54.521 --> 31:56.088
Please, Abby.

31:56.131 --> 31:57.524
Sara doesn't trust me.

31:57.567 --> 31:58.873
You don't need me.

31:58.917 --> 32:01.702
Everything that this place
stands for,

32:01.745 --> 32:04.096
this is you, Clay.

32:06.359 --> 32:07.534
And you can't expect

32:07.577 --> 32:09.710
Sara to let her guard down

32:09.753 --> 32:11.451
if you don't
let your guard down.

32:14.149 --> 32:15.150
Yeah.

32:18.066 --> 32:19.676
This is Reeves.

32:19.720 --> 32:21.200
THEO:
Is this the police guy?

32:21.243 --> 32:22.462
Theo?

32:22.505 --> 32:23.854
My mom needs help.

32:28.903 --> 32:30.905
Theo, where are you?THEO: We're at the place

32:30.949 --> 32:32.646
where we parked our car.

32:32.689 --> 32:35.649
Please, come. Please!I'm on my way, Theo!

32:41.960 --> 32:43.091
Mom!

32:57.540 --> 33:01.544
It's okay. It's okay.

33:09.074 --> 33:10.901
We were coming
back from dinner.

33:10.945 --> 33:12.381
We saw him going
through our car.

33:13.948 --> 33:16.168
I mean, the guy wasn't leaving.

33:16.211 --> 33:18.431
I fought him until he ran off.

33:18.474 --> 33:20.041
You weren't able
to describe him, huh?

33:20.085 --> 33:22.174
He was wearing a mask.

33:22.217 --> 33:23.914
Well, it sounds like
he might have been looking

33:23.958 --> 33:25.438
for something in your car.

33:25.481 --> 33:26.787
Our stuff isn't
worth taking.

33:26.830 --> 33:30.008
You said the guy that
killed my mom was dead.

33:31.226 --> 33:32.445
Then who did this to us?

33:32.488 --> 33:34.360
Come in.

33:34.403 --> 33:36.579
Hey.
Reeves.

33:36.623 --> 33:37.580
There he is.

33:37.624 --> 33:39.060
My friend Abby
asked me

33:39.104 --> 33:41.019
to come and get you.

33:41.062 --> 33:43.456
That toy rocket ship
that was in your car,

33:43.499 --> 33:44.805
she fixed it.

33:46.241 --> 33:48.765
Actually, Abby asked me
to bring him down.

33:48.809 --> 33:51.507
Oh, she did?
Yup.

33:51.551 --> 33:54.771
Come on, Theo. Abby's so fun.

33:57.774 --> 33:59.950
Mind your manners, baby.

34:08.307 --> 34:09.699
Are you all right?

34:09.743 --> 34:13.790
I want you to know that
I'm not just some...

34:13.834 --> 34:18.317
You know, I have a job,
clean houses.

34:18.360 --> 34:20.449
I've been applying for
everything else I can find.

34:22.277 --> 34:26.499
You know, I'm trying
to be a good mom, you know?

34:26.542 --> 34:29.110
I'm trying.

34:29.154 --> 34:33.462
You know,

34:33.506 --> 34:37.597
my mother, she was, um...

34:37.640 --> 34:39.642
She was someone
who needed help, too.

34:41.514 --> 34:45.909
I mean, she wasn't
perfect, but...

34:45.953 --> 34:47.998
I love her for who
she was trying to be.

34:48.042 --> 34:50.610
Look, I'm scared

34:50.653 --> 34:54.266
that the second I say
I need help,

34:54.309 --> 34:55.919
they're gonna take him
away from me.

34:55.963 --> 34:58.096
I know you are, Sara.

35:00.663 --> 35:03.536
But you can trust me.

35:05.190 --> 35:08.280
Okay, there's something
I need to tell you.

35:08.323 --> 35:09.977
I didn't want to say it.

35:10.020 --> 35:12.284
A couple of weeks
before my mom died,

35:12.327 --> 35:15.156
my own pills went missing.

35:15.200 --> 35:16.462
Prescription?

35:16.505 --> 35:21.423
I take tramadol for my migraines
from the TBI.

35:21.467 --> 35:24.165
And I need those pills.

35:24.209 --> 35:26.167
So when they didn't
show up in the mail,

35:26.211 --> 35:28.648
you know, I got
so worked up.

35:28.691 --> 35:33.131
My mom said she was gonna call
the insurance company for me.

35:35.829 --> 35:38.005
You think she was back to using?

35:41.095 --> 35:43.489
Think she stole my pills, too?

35:46.231 --> 35:48.581
Boss, Mae Carter
didn't steal anything.

35:48.624 --> 35:50.017
We talked
to the insurance company.

35:50.060 --> 35:51.671
They had a record
of when Mae called

35:51.714 --> 35:53.194
about Sara's
missing pills.

35:53.238 --> 35:55.805
Mae asked them to e-mail
the tracking numbers

35:55.849 --> 35:57.764
to Sara's account in
the insurance portal.

35:57.807 --> 35:59.940
But they screwed up.

35:59.983 --> 36:02.769
They sent her a list
of tracking numbers of all

36:02.812 --> 36:04.901
the missing packages recorded
over the last year.

36:04.945 --> 36:07.252
Mae was a command investigator.
She knew how to dig.

36:07.295 --> 36:08.557
Boss, she was
single-handedly

36:08.601 --> 36:10.733
unraveling a
prescription drug ring.

36:10.777 --> 36:13.040
She wasn't going
to Jax for herself.

36:13.083 --> 36:14.563
She was tailing
the person

36:14.607 --> 36:16.826
who was stealing
the pills.Jax's supplier.

36:16.870 --> 36:19.046
So the supplier is the only one
left in the equation,

36:19.089 --> 36:20.395
has to be the one
who attacked Sara.

36:20.439 --> 36:22.223
Right, but what was he
looking for in her car?

36:22.267 --> 36:23.703
And how'd he even know
it was there?

36:23.746 --> 36:26.793
Bishop, get Abby.

36:26.836 --> 36:28.186
Hmm.

36:28.229 --> 36:29.839
McGee, pull up that
TV video thing.

36:29.883 --> 36:32.190
Oh, you mean "When
Gibbs Attacks"

36:33.582 --> 36:36.455
I'm sorry, that's-that's
what McGee calls it.

36:38.108 --> 36:39.632
GIBBS:
Fast-forward.

36:41.111 --> 36:42.200
Slow it down.

36:43.549 --> 36:45.507
Freeze it right there.
Zoom in.

36:47.683 --> 36:48.641
Uh, that's Jax Wesley.

36:48.684 --> 36:50.077
Outside his hostel.

36:50.120 --> 36:52.166
Who is he talking to?

36:52.210 --> 36:53.515
ABBY:
Who is who talking to?

36:53.559 --> 36:54.864
I'm like a step behind here,

36:54.908 --> 36:56.736
and it's making my brain
feel really weird.

36:56.779 --> 36:58.520
Abbs, we're looking
for a picture.

36:58.564 --> 37:01.001
McGEE:
And we only have a partial;
we need the full image.

37:01.044 --> 37:02.524
Yeah, I just sent you
the freeze-frame.

37:02.568 --> 37:04.918
No worries because
I have all the contents

37:04.961 --> 37:06.398
of Sara's car categorized,

37:06.441 --> 37:08.269
and the picture
you are looking for

37:08.313 --> 37:09.923
is...

37:09.966 --> 37:12.621
here.

37:15.320 --> 37:16.756
McGee.

37:16.799 --> 37:18.366
Boss, right behind you.

37:18.410 --> 37:21.935
Um, what just happened

37:21.978 --> 37:23.284
You got to check that
with the office.

37:23.328 --> 37:24.894
Head back down
there, let me know.

37:24.938 --> 37:26.853
Okay?

37:28.289 --> 37:30.683
Hey, there. You're back.

37:30.726 --> 37:32.119
So what can I
help you with?

37:36.166 --> 37:38.125
BISHOP: Mae Carter realized
her list of missing packages

37:38.168 --> 37:40.867
all went through your warehouse.

37:40.910 --> 37:43.609
She showed up
asking questions.

37:43.652 --> 37:46.525
And she suspected that
you were stealing packages

37:46.568 --> 37:48.483
from your own
warehouse.

37:48.527 --> 37:49.963
She followed you

37:50.006 --> 37:52.792
and watched you sell pills
to your buyer Jax.

37:54.010 --> 37:55.447
BISHOP:
You saw her there.

37:55.490 --> 37:58.276
You even saw her snap
a couple pictures.

37:59.538 --> 38:01.453
So you had Jax kill her

38:01.496 --> 38:02.802
and destroy the pictures.

38:02.845 --> 38:04.673
But when he tossed her house...

38:06.109 --> 38:07.807
...he didn't find the pictures.

38:07.850 --> 38:12.028
Which was okay until
you saw one resurface

38:12.072 --> 38:14.335
in the
Profile 360promo.

38:14.379 --> 38:16.990
Then you went looking for
it in Sara Carter's car.

38:17.033 --> 38:20.472
She fought you off
and, uh...

38:20.515 --> 38:22.343
...she kicked your ass.

38:22.387 --> 38:24.040
You know, that cut
looks good on you.

38:24.084 --> 38:26.521
I give it three seconds
before he lawyers up.

38:26.565 --> 38:29.568
I want a lawyer.

38:29.611 --> 38:31.831
Thank you very much.

38:31.874 --> 38:33.702
I'll give SECNAV the good news.

38:33.746 --> 38:35.443
And I'll assure her
there won't be any

38:35.487 --> 38:37.184
future installments
of "When Gibbs Attacks."

38:37.227 --> 38:38.141
Hmm.

38:41.797 --> 38:44.887
So this all started
with a mother

38:44.931 --> 38:46.715
trying to take away
her daughter's pain.

38:48.978 --> 38:50.371
Sounds about right.

38:50.415 --> 38:51.807
What about Sara?

38:51.851 --> 38:53.722
You know she doesn't really
have an aunt in Texas.

38:53.766 --> 38:56.029
Reeves is handling it.

38:56.072 --> 38:59.380
He's really coming
into his own, isn't he?

39:01.251 --> 39:06.735
♪ We were born
into a world on fire... ♪

39:16.441 --> 39:18.007
You staying for dinner?

39:18.051 --> 39:20.575
Um, I can't tonight.

39:20.619 --> 39:23.491
In fact, I should, uh,
I should really get going.

ABBY: McGee, I had five
different kinds of soups,

40:49.359 --> 40:50.622
and I feel like a...

40:50.665 --> 40:51.927
like a rainbow
inside an icicle.

40:51.971 --> 40:53.363
McGEE:
Rubbing it in.

40:53.407 --> 40:56.149
I'm not trying to rub it in.
I'm just being honest.

40:56.192 --> 40:57.977
That cold felt amazing!

40:58.020 --> 40:59.500
And now I officially
like soup!

41:01.197 --> 41:03.025
Okay, listen, you can
cry to us later.

41:03.069 --> 41:04.026
Good night, Abbs.

41:04.070 --> 41:06.289
I love you.

41:06.333 --> 41:08.030
Abby, cheers to you.

41:08.074 --> 41:09.205
For what?

41:09.249 --> 41:10.511
Choosing me to
come with you,

41:10.555 --> 41:13.775
and for convincing me
to talk to Sara.

41:13.819 --> 41:16.517
I told you,
you didn't need me.

41:16.561 --> 41:19.651
Come on, Abby,
everybody needs you.

41:19.694 --> 41:23.524
You're our angel in platforms.

41:23.568 --> 41:24.960
Spare some change?

41:25.004 --> 41:26.832
Oh, yeah, man,
absolutely.

41:26.875 --> 41:29.225
Of course.Just give me the whole thing.

41:31.880 --> 41:33.665
Listen, mate.

41:33.708 --> 41:36.189
You, too.
Give me your wallet now.

41:36.232 --> 41:37.495
Okay, no problem, man.

41:39.584 --> 41:42.108
Um, you know what,
maybe if-if we could talk,

41:42.151 --> 41:43.892
then, um, I could help you.

41:47.896 --> 41:50.246
You think you're better than me?

41:50.290 --> 41:52.597
Look, just
take it, yeah?

41:52.640 --> 41:54.076
You want to help me?

41:54.120 --> 41:55.469
Look, just take it
and go, yeah?

41:55.513 --> 41:57.602
You want to help me? Say it.
You want to help me?
