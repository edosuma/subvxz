Great game, huh, Pots?

01:27.054 --> 01:28.283
POTSIE:
Oldies.

01:28.422 --> 01:29.912
How can you people be watching

01:30.057 --> 01:31.718
a-a sports event here

01:31.858 --> 01:34.350
when there is
a Shirley Temple movie on?

Fonzie, Green Bay!

01:36.797 --> 01:38.162
Richie, Heidi!

01:38.298 --> 01:39.993
POTSIE:
Heidi?

01:40.133 --> 01:42.101
Don't you touch that dial.

01:42.235 --> 01:44.499
Can I have
your attention, please?

01:44.638 --> 01:47.039
Ah, now this is the menu

01:47.174 --> 01:48.733
for the Cunningham
Thanksgiving dinner

01:48.875 --> 01:50.707
will be as follows:

01:50.844 --> 01:51.936
tomato juice with lemon wedge,

01:52.079 --> 01:53.513
turkey with cranberry sauce,

01:53.647 --> 01:55.809
mashed potatoes, candied yams,

01:55.949 --> 01:57.815
giblet gravy, chestnut stuffing,
green beans,

01:57.951 --> 01:59.646
hot rolls and butter,

01:59.786 --> 02:01.049
celery and olives,

02:01.188 --> 02:02.713
Pumpkin pie,

02:02.856 --> 02:04.017
cider and coffee,

02:04.157 --> 02:06.717
and, of course, mints.

02:08.027 --> 02:09.426
Well, you know,
this is gonna be better

02:09.562 --> 02:11.156
than it reads on paper.

02:11.298 --> 02:14.063
(cheering)

02:14.201 --> 02:15.794
Oh, thank you.

02:15.936 --> 02:18.496
Thank you very much.

02:18.639 --> 02:21.973
Uh, Richard, will you mash
the potatoes, please?

02:22.109 --> 02:23.235
- Will do.
- Howard,

02:23.377 --> 02:24.469
will you take the turkey

02:24.611 --> 02:26.204
out of the oven
so it can cool?

02:26.346 --> 02:27.905
- Right away, sweetheart.
- Joanie, I'll need you

02:28.048 --> 02:30.016
to put the plates on the table.

02:30.150 --> 02:31.015
Okay, Mom.

02:31.151 --> 02:33.142
Arthur, will you
drain the veggies?

02:33.286 --> 02:34.412
Draining the veggies.

02:34.554 --> 02:35.578
Will you look
at those cheerleaders.

02:35.722 --> 02:37.417
- Cartwheels!
- RALPH: Yeah!

02:37.557 --> 02:40.720
Richard, the potatoes now!

02:40.861 --> 02:42.829
Yeah, in a second, Mom.
Green Bay's on the 20 yard line.

02:42.963 --> 02:45.330
- I think they're gonna...
- What are you doing?!

02:45.465 --> 02:46.591
Qynom!
"sports!

02:46.733 --> 02:48.098
- Now hear this!
- Uh-oh.

02:48.235 --> 02:49.964
I knew we should watch Heidi.

02:50.103 --> 02:52.299
What's wrong, sweetheart?

02:52.439 --> 02:53.873
Don't "sweetheart" me!

02:54.007 --> 02:55.634
Hey, Pots, a family fight.
Let's get out of here.

02:55.776 --> 02:57.505
Right, uh,
happy Thanksgiving.

02:57.644 --> 02:58.668
Let's go to my house.

02:58.812 --> 03:00.143
But your dad didn't invite me.

03:00.280 --> 03:02.271
That's okay.
He didn't invite me either.

03:04.017 --> 03:05.075
Listen, all of you.

03:05.218 --> 03:07.346
I have worked hard all day.

03:07.487 --> 03:09.319
I've set the table, I've washed
all of the good china

03:09.456 --> 03:10.821
and the dishes
and I've made the gravy

03:10.957 --> 03:13.085
and I've baked
and I've cooked and I've...

03:13.226 --> 03:14.421
I'm cooking the veggies.

03:14.561 --> 03:16.825
I've cooked the veggies.
Thank you, Arthur.

03:16.963 --> 03:19.523
I cooked the vegetables,
and I arranged the flowers,

03:19.666 --> 03:22.966
and not one of you has lifted
one finger to help me, not one!

03:23.103 --> 03:24.070
Yeah, but Marion...

03:24.204 --> 03:25.296
Thanksgiving is a time

03:25.439 --> 03:26.600
of family togetherness.

03:26.740 --> 03:28.174
A time of sharing
and working together

03:28.308 --> 03:30.572
toward a common,
uh, common turkey.

03:30.711 --> 03:33.203
I'm just working my fingers
to the bone,

03:33.346 --> 03:34.404
and what are you doing?

03:34.548 --> 03:36.073
You're all just sitting here
comfortably

03:36.216 --> 03:38.446
watching some stupid
little basketball game.

03:38.585 --> 03:41.054
I've had it! I've had it!

03:41.188 --> 03:44.123
The only company I've had today
is a tom turkey.

03:45.425 --> 03:47.450
You've insulted the memory
of our forefathers,

03:47.594 --> 03:50.894
those brave pilgrims
who began Thanksgiving Day

03:51.031 --> 03:53.056
and made it a day
to look forward to.

03:53.200 --> 03:55.760
You have forgotten the meaning
of Thanksgiving.

03:55.902 --> 03:57.461
I'll remind you.

03:57.604 --> 04:00.130
Now, in 1621...

04:00.273 --> 04:02.367
<i>the Pilgrims had
this wonderful harvest...</i>

04:10.584 --> 04:12.518
Mistress Joanie,

04:12.652 --> 04:14.780
maketh ready
for the choir practice.

04:14.921 --> 04:17.219
JOANIE:
I hear thee, Mother.

Advertise your product or brand here

04:28.668 --> 04:31.933
I should hath made
this door wider.

04:32.072 --> 04:34.370
You know, you would think
there would be

04:34.508 --> 04:37.534
at least one other blacksmith
in this colony.

04:37.677 --> 04:41.375
I can't keep up with the
business and do my chores, too.

04:41.515 --> 04:42.676
Greetings, wife.

04:42.816 --> 04:44.215
Greetings, husband.

04:44.351 --> 04:46.752
You are a good man, husband.

04:46.887 --> 04:49.151
Yes, I am.

04:49.289 --> 04:52.520
And I do good work, too.

04:52.659 --> 04:54.991
It's not like last year
when I first became a blacksmith

04:55.128 --> 04:58.996
and had to recall
20 defective horseshoes.

05:00.667 --> 05:01.793
Good evening, Mistress Joanie.

05:01.935 --> 05:05.667
Greetings, Father.

05:05.806 --> 05:07.706
Oh, oh, I'm sorry.

05:07.841 --> 05:10.572
I forgot you disapprove
of kissing, Father.

05:10.710 --> 05:12.144
Kissing is a tool
of the Devil.

05:12.279 --> 05:14.543
It could lead to other things.

05:14.681 --> 05:16.240
- Yes!
- Marion...

05:18.819 --> 05:20.548
You know, husband,

05:20.687 --> 05:22.280
tomorrow marketh the end

05:22.422 --> 05:25.255
of our first year
in the New World.

05:25.392 --> 05:28.259
Yes, and you know, wife,
it has been a bountiful harvest.

05:28.395 --> 05:29.487
I know, dear.

05:29.629 --> 05:32.098
I think we should have
a celebration.

05:32.232 --> 05:35.668
One of eating, singing,
and good fellowship.

05:35.802 --> 05:40.171
Yes, and we could call it
Bountiful Harvest Day.

05:40.307 --> 05:41.741
Will there be dancing?

05:41.875 --> 05:43.468
Hold your tongue, daughter.

05:44.678 --> 05:45.975
Dancing is another tool
of the Devil.

05:46.112 --> 05:48.171
Do you want to wind up
in the stocks?

05:48.315 --> 05:51.307
Boy, being a Pilgrim
sure is a drageth.

05:53.420 --> 05:57.118
Well, we womenfolks
were discussing it

05:57.257 --> 06:00.090
at the town meeting,
and we think

06:00.227 --> 06:02.924
that we should have a big feast

06:03.063 --> 06:05.555
and call it "Thanksgiving."

06:05.699 --> 06:07.064
Thanksgiving Day.

06:07.200 --> 06:09.464
Well, that's all right for now.

06:09.603 --> 06:12.038
Next year, let's have it
in warmer weather,

06:12.172 --> 06:14.698
say, the Fourth of July.

06:18.511 --> 06:19.876
Hail.

06:20.013 --> 06:22.141
Hail and well met,
Mistress Joanie...

06:22.282 --> 06:24.944
Father and Mother.

06:25.085 --> 06:28.419
Can't you just say "greetings"
like everyone else?

06:28.555 --> 06:30.080
Go to your loft.

06:30.223 --> 06:32.624
I can't.
I have to get to choir practice.

06:32.759 --> 06:36.525
Or I'll miss my place
next to that Pilgrim hunketh.

06:38.999 --> 06:41.491
Father, are you letting her
go out like that?

06:41.635 --> 06:42.727
Have you seen her skirt?

06:42.869 --> 06:43.893
It's up to her ankles!

06:44.037 --> 06:46.472
That's the way of the young.

06:46.606 --> 06:49.507
Well, I found some blueberries
up on the hill.

06:49.643 --> 06:51.634
Oh, what a thrill!

06:54.347 --> 06:55.246
(girls screaming outside)

06:55.382 --> 06:56.611
What was that?

06:56.750 --> 06:58.741
Oh.

07:00.620 --> 07:03.555
'Tis my friend, Master Fonzie.

07:03.690 --> 07:04.623
He has strange ways.

07:04.758 --> 07:07.352
I would not let him come
into this house.

07:07.494 --> 07:09.485
Too late now.

07:19.139 --> 07:22.473
Greet-eth-amundo.

07:22.609 --> 07:24.407
What can I do for you,
Master Fonzie?

07:24.544 --> 07:26.137
0, great blacksmith,
I need a new part.

07:26.279 --> 07:29.078
'Tis my brakes again.

07:29.215 --> 07:31.616
Mistresses, thank ye, thank ye.

07:31.751 --> 07:33.981
Inspiration Rock,

07:34.120 --> 07:35.747
two turns of the hour glass.

07:35.889 --> 07:38.119
Be there.

07:39.693 --> 07:42.185
Master Arthur,
will you sup with us?

07:42.329 --> 07:44.320
Oh, uh, thank ye,
but nay ye, uh...

07:46.599 --> 07:49.591
I got a res to sup
with the Standish triplets.

07:49.736 --> 07:50.965
Whoa!

07:52.005 --> 07:53.063
Oh, these colonial fires.

07:53.206 --> 07:56.198
They're not like they were
in England.

07:56.343 --> 07:59.369
Well, good dame Cunningham,
I'll take care of that.

07:59.512 --> 08:00.911
-(Marion sighs)
- No need, no need.

08:01.047 --> 08:03.038
Stand back.

08:11.958 --> 08:14.950
Hail, farewell, and whoa-eth.

08:18.231 --> 08:21.166
Husband, did see
what he did with the fire?

08:21.301 --> 08:23.099
Isn't he wonderful?

08:23.236 --> 08:25.227
I see it, and I do not like it.

08:25.372 --> 08:28.501
He has strange ways
for a Pilgrim.

08:28.641 --> 08:30.473
Well, he may dress
a little differently, but, uh...

08:30.610 --> 08:33.635
It's not that.

08:33.780 --> 08:37.010
It's... it's what he does
with the maidens.

08:37.150 --> 08:39.881
He only takes them
to Inspiration Rock.

08:40.020 --> 08:42.648
That, too,
is the way of the young.

08:42.789 --> 08:45.053
Wife, go cooketh.

08:45.191 --> 08:46.181
And another thing.

08:46.326 --> 08:48.351
He has no fear of the Indians.

08:48.495 --> 08:49.963
Why should we fear
the Indians, Father?

08:50.096 --> 08:51.894
They've done nothing
but help us.

08:52.032 --> 08:55.195
Oh, you're so young
and foolish!

08:55.335 --> 08:56.962
Our elders have ruled
that they are heathens.

08:57.103 --> 08:58.730
That we must keep our distance.

08:58.872 --> 09:01.864
Master Fonzie has broken
the rule,

09:02.008 --> 09:03.999
and we must let him know that.

09:07.247 --> 09:09.272
I think he knows.

09:14.654 --> 09:16.122
We'll be at our tableth.

09:16.256 --> 09:19.226
Yes, trapping and tracking
all day

09:19.359 --> 09:20.758
gives a man a mighty thirst.

09:20.894 --> 09:21.861
Yeah.

09:21.995 --> 09:23.520
Hurry up with those ciders!

09:23.663 --> 09:24.994
Here you are.

09:25.131 --> 09:27.293
- Two ciders.
- Ah.

09:27.434 --> 09:28.765
That'll be one raccoon pelt.

09:28.902 --> 09:30.961
You got change for a skunk?

09:31.104 --> 09:33.801
YEP, YEP, YEP, YEP, YEP-

09:34.741 --> 09:37.005
Squirrel tail, squirrel tail...

09:39.079 --> 09:41.707
...and one small rat.

09:41.848 --> 09:42.940
It was so much much easier

09:43.083 --> 09:45.780
when they let you run a tab.

09:45.919 --> 09:47.284
Innkeeper, I'm hungry.

09:47.420 --> 09:49.684
What have you got here
for two hungry trappers?

09:49.823 --> 09:51.587
The special tonight
is mooseburgers.

09:51.724 --> 09:53.988
The horns are extra.

09:54.127 --> 09:55.959
I think I just lost
my appetite.

09:56.096 --> 09:57.723
Ah, you'll love my mooseburgers.

09:57.864 --> 10:00.060
They go down very nicely.

10:00.200 --> 10:02.168
Yes, but do they stay down?
(laughing)

10:02.302 --> 10:04.202
I've still got it,
even in the New World.

10:04.337 --> 10:05.327
Yeah.

10:05.472 --> 10:06.701
- Huh, Wolf stalker?
- Yeah.

10:06.840 --> 10:08.831
Be right back, Bearslayer.

10:12.212 --> 10:13.646
Wait a minute...

10:13.780 --> 10:14.679
Wait a minute.

10:14.814 --> 10:16.509
You forgot to take a lamp.

10:16.649 --> 10:18.276
Don't get lost out there.

10:19.285 --> 10:21.720
He's such a wolf stalker.

10:22.989 --> 10:24.354
Hail, Alfred.

10:24.491 --> 10:25.617
Hail.

10:25.758 --> 10:27.248
What say ye to, uh,
a little credit?

10:27.393 --> 10:29.794
Ah, sorry, Master Richie,
but you know the rules.

10:29.929 --> 10:31.988
Pelts on the barrel head.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.196
I'll stand Master Richie
to a cider.

10:36.336 --> 10:38.896
Two squirrel tails
and keep the change.

10:39.038 --> 10:41.234
Take back your rat.

10:41.374 --> 10:44.605
Boy, that's some bathroom.

10:44.744 --> 10:48.146
I had to share with
a woodchuck and a moose.

10:48.281 --> 10:49.840
Were they friendly?

10:49.983 --> 10:51.576
Warm.

10:51.718 --> 10:53.482
Oh, thank you.

10:53.620 --> 10:55.019
- Hail, Wolf stalker!
- Hey!

10:55.155 --> 10:57.317
How goeth the trapping business
with you two?

10:57.457 --> 10:58.982
Not too good,
but we've invented a new trap,

10:59.125 --> 11:00.820
-and we'll be able
to catch anything. -Yeah.

11:00.960 --> 11:04.225
Then we'll be rich, Rich.

11:04.364 --> 11:06.162
Greetings!

11:06.299 --> 11:08.529
Hail and well met, Father.

11:08.668 --> 11:11.899
Can't you just say "greetings"
like everybody else?

11:13.173 --> 11:16.609
I have fixed
your cooking pots again, Alfred.

11:26.052 --> 11:28.680
Alfred, isn't that Icicle Annie?

11:28.821 --> 11:30.255
The same.

11:30.390 --> 11:32.722
She's not anymore.

11:32.859 --> 11:35.760
I tell you,
there are demons within him.

11:35.895 --> 11:38.387
Yeah, I wish
he'd loan me a couple.

11:38.531 --> 11:41.592
Hail, Friend Fonzie.

11:41.734 --> 11:42.860
Thank ye.

11:43.002 --> 11:43.992
- Come join us.
- Yeah.

11:44.137 --> 11:46.265
Thank ye.

11:49.242 --> 11:52.268
Are you Wolf stalker
and Deerslayer?

11:52.412 --> 11:55.382
That's, uh,
Wolf stalker and Bearslayer.

11:55.515 --> 11:57.950
Who careth?

11:58.084 --> 12:00.553
I got a bone to pick with you.

12:00.687 --> 12:01.848
Oh, we don't trade in bones.

12:01.988 --> 12:03.888
They're too hard to trap.

12:04.023 --> 12:06.458
- You come over on the Mayflower?
- Yeah.

12:06.593 --> 12:08.459
What boat's your brain
coming in on?

12:08.595 --> 12:11.223
(laughs)

12:11.364 --> 12:12.763
Oh...

12:12.899 --> 12:15.266
Good one, Master Fonz.

12:15.401 --> 12:17.699
I knoweth that.

12:17.837 --> 12:21.603
Now, I hear you've been cheating
some friends of mine.

12:21.741 --> 12:23.709
Master Fonzie,
what seems to be the trouble?

12:23.843 --> 12:26.608
Ask these hairy ones here.

12:26.746 --> 12:28.111
They've been buying pelts
from the Indians

12:28.248 --> 12:31.843
and trading them in,
uh, counterfeit wampum.

12:31.985 --> 12:33.578
Oh, you think it's easy
making counterfeit wampum

12:33.720 --> 12:36.121
when you don't know
what the real wampum looks like?

12:36.256 --> 12:37.621
Besides, who cares?

12:37.757 --> 12:39.623
They're only Indians.

12:39.759 --> 12:40.749
I care.

12:40.893 --> 12:42.418
And I, Master Fonzie.

12:42.562 --> 12:44.553
Because they're human beings.

12:44.697 --> 12:46.131
Those sniveling savages

12:46.266 --> 12:48.496
didn't have the courage
to accuse Bearslayer,

12:48.635 --> 12:50.865
-and face him eye to eye.
- Yeah.

12:54.574 --> 12:56.474
Indians! To arms! To arms!

12:56.609 --> 12:58.509
Ho, ho!
They're in our compound.

12:58.645 --> 13:01.444
Savages! Savages!
They'll destroy our homes.

13:01.581 --> 13:02.878
All right. Hold it.

13:03.016 --> 13:04.245
I invited them here.

13:04.384 --> 13:05.783
We have to settle this matter.
It's a matter of trust.

13:05.918 --> 13:07.147
Hear, hear!

13:07.287 --> 13:08.846
Well said.

13:08.988 --> 13:10.683
Master Fonzie,

13:10.823 --> 13:12.723
by bringing these savages
into the compound,

13:12.859 --> 13:15.089
you have broken the law
and endangered our lives.

13:15.228 --> 13:19.187
And the law says that you must
be put into the stocks.

13:19.332 --> 13:20.800
CROWD:
Yeah!

13:20.933 --> 13:22.992
You can't put Master Fonzie

13:23.136 --> 13:24.968
in the stocks
for trying to undo a wrong.

13:25.104 --> 13:27.072
Oh, yes, I can.

13:27.206 --> 13:28.901
The law's the law.

13:29.042 --> 13:31.568
And besides,
he cavorts with demons.

13:31.711 --> 13:34.612
Bearslayer, Wolf stalker,
lock him in.

13:34.747 --> 13:35.873
Right.

13:36.015 --> 13:37.483
Whoa-eth.

13:37.617 --> 13:40.643
On second thought, couldn't we
just ask him to leave?

13:40.787 --> 13:42.687
Bu the law has been broken.

13:42.822 --> 13:44.881
Now if we cannot punish
Master Fonzie,

13:45.024 --> 13:46.822
then we must punish
the intruders--

13:46.959 --> 13:48.017
- Yes.
-the Indians--

13:48.161 --> 13:50.152
and my guneth is loaded.

13:51.631 --> 13:54.225
Well, it waseth.

13:54.367 --> 13:55.766
All right, now, cooleth it.

13:57.303 --> 13:58.862
The Indians have done no wrong.

13:59.005 --> 14:00.234
Let them go in peace.

14:00.373 --> 14:03.240
I will go
to the stockades myself, huh?

14:12.618 --> 14:13.983
Master Fonzie.

14:14.120 --> 14:15.849
What're you going to do now?

14:15.988 --> 14:19.083
Uh, I figure I'd hang
around here for awhile.

14:27.467 --> 14:29.834
MARION:
Now, where was I? Oh, yes!

14:29.969 --> 14:31.835
The strange one
was in the stocks.

14:31.971 --> 14:33.530
That's me. (chuckles)

14:33.673 --> 14:35.368
And his friend
was trying to free him.

14:35.508 --> 14:36.532
That's you.

14:36.676 --> 14:37.871
So the friend got up

14:38.010 --> 14:40.035
this petition,
and he took it around

14:40.179 --> 14:41.340
to all the Pilgrims...

14:41.481 --> 14:43.472
(bell ringing)

14:48.821 --> 14:51.552
Hear ye, hear ye, hear ye.

14:51.691 --> 14:54.183
All right, all right.

14:54.327 --> 14:57.126
Today this brave man
is in the stocks

14:57.263 --> 14:59.857
because he stood up
for what he believed in.

14:59.999 --> 15:02.798
Well, tomorrow, it could be
any one of you.

15:02.935 --> 15:05.927
However, your signatures
on this petition

15:06.072 --> 15:08.404
demanding his immediate release

15:08.541 --> 15:11.033
will let the village elders know
where we stand.

15:11.177 --> 15:13.475
Now, are you with us?

15:16.749 --> 15:19.844
It was a good speech,
Master Richard.

15:19.986 --> 15:22.785
It just fell on deaf ears.

15:22.922 --> 15:24.913
Ah, thank you,
thank you very much.

15:28.127 --> 15:29.060
RALPH:
We're not signing the petition.

15:29.195 --> 15:31.061
The longer he stays
in the stocks,

15:31.197 --> 15:33.256
the more wenches for us-eth.

15:33.399 --> 15:35.595
Come on, let's bundle.

15:35.735 --> 15:36.793
- Freeze.
- Freeze?

15:36.936 --> 15:38.370
I don't think
you're in any position

15:38.504 --> 15:40.939
to give orders. (cackles)

15:47.747 --> 15:50.478
Just keeping her warm
for you, Master Fonz.

15:50.616 --> 15:51.674
He broke the stock.

15:51.818 --> 15:53.912
Hey, our first stockbroker.

15:59.859 --> 16:01.327
I'm here to tell you something.

16:01.461 --> 16:04.795
When Master Fonzie speaks,
everybody listens.

16:04.931 --> 16:06.729
He's loose.

16:06.866 --> 16:08.163
Let's go get the Indians.

16:08.301 --> 16:09.530
ALL:
Yeah, yeah.

16:09.669 --> 16:10.966
Cool it!

16:11.103 --> 16:12.195
Save your powder.

16:12.338 --> 16:13.863
I'll go back in the stocks.

16:14.006 --> 16:15.997
(crowd murmuring)

16:18.177 --> 16:20.509
Careful, oh, dear,
looketh, look, looketh.

16:20.646 --> 16:21.636
Ah, poor child.

16:21.781 --> 16:23.306
<i>Oh, oh.</i>

16:23.449 --> 16:25.440
Over here.

16:25.585 --> 16:27.576
Oh, help me.

16:28.588 --> 16:30.647
Zounds, our trap worked!

16:30.790 --> 16:32.189
Do we get to keep her?

16:32.325 --> 16:33.656
You fool!

16:33.793 --> 16:34.783
This is my daughter.

16:34.927 --> 16:36.656
- And my sister.
- Oh.

16:36.796 --> 16:38.355
Don't I get any credit?

16:38.498 --> 16:40.091
Now hear thee this,

16:40.233 --> 16:41.997
you chowderheads you,

16:42.134 --> 16:45.331
you put this trap right
in the middle of a pathway.

16:45.471 --> 16:47.701
We don't go in bushes.
We're afraid of animals.

16:47.840 --> 16:49.330
How do you open this?

16:49.475 --> 16:50.499
BOTH:
Open it?

16:50.643 --> 16:52.475
Which one of you is dim enough

16:52.612 --> 16:55.172
to build a trap
you didn't know how to open?

16:55.314 --> 16:56.372
BOTH:
He was.

16:56.516 --> 16:58.143
I can't spend the rest
of my life

16:58.284 --> 17:00.150
-in one of these.
- RALPH: You're right.

17:00.286 --> 17:01.981
Styles do change.

17:04.624 --> 17:06.285
We'll have, we'll have
to rescue Mistress Joanie,

17:06.425 --> 17:08.018
at least her foot.

17:08.160 --> 17:10.685
Perchance Master Fonzie
can help us.

17:10.829 --> 17:13.731
Master Fonzie?

17:13.866 --> 17:15.857
Ask and you shall receive.

17:16.002 --> 17:18.164
You would help us, strange one?

17:18.304 --> 17:21.705
If you release me
and let the Indians go in peace.

17:21.840 --> 17:24.037
A9 reed?

17:24.175 --> 17:25.905
- Father?
- Ag reed.

17:26.045 --> 17:28.241
- Someone get the key!
- No need.

17:30.483 --> 17:32.611
I love it when he does that.

17:39.692 --> 17:41.592
(gasps)

17:41.727 --> 17:43.718
Oh, it came off!

17:43.863 --> 17:46.491
Oh, husband, didst see that?

17:46.632 --> 17:47.622
(Howard grunts)

17:47.767 --> 17:50.236
Perhaps he does deal
with demons.

17:50.369 --> 17:52.929
There ain't no demons here.

17:53.072 --> 17:56.201
They say I have a knacketh.

17:56.342 --> 17:57.935
Master Fonzie, I was wrong.

17:58.077 --> 18:00.478
I see now there was no evil
intent in your strangeness.

18:00.613 --> 18:02.206
How can I repay you?

18:02.348 --> 18:05.716
Maybe we should invite him
to our Thanksgiving feast.

18:05.851 --> 18:07.546
Well, I'm very sorry.

18:07.687 --> 18:10.247
Uh, thank ye,
but I have a res to sup

18:10.389 --> 18:12.756
with some of my Indian friends.

18:12.892 --> 18:14.553
Better watch it, Master Arthur.

18:14.694 --> 18:17.254
Thee may be the main meal.

18:17.396 --> 18:18.727
Rumors.

18:18.864 --> 18:21.231
She listens to rumors.

18:21.367 --> 18:22.857
But, Master Fonzie,
they're savages.

18:23.002 --> 18:24.128
Yes, yes.

18:24.270 --> 18:25.738
Hold it! Hold it!
Just because they look different

18:25.871 --> 18:27.965
don't mean they're savages.

18:28.107 --> 18:30.599
-(murmuring) -Oh, yes, yes...
- RICHIE: Looketh!

18:30.743 --> 18:32.233
We came to this New World

18:32.378 --> 18:34.540
because people used
to think we were different.

18:34.680 --> 18:36.205
Yeah, we came here for freedom.

18:36.349 --> 18:39.182
Why should we take
that from somebody else?

18:39.318 --> 18:42.879
We came here 'cause the trapping
was so crummy in London.

18:45.491 --> 18:47.721
Master Fonzie is right.

18:47.860 --> 18:50.454
Perhaps we should get to know
the Indians better.

18:50.596 --> 18:52.462
Do you think they would accept
an invitation

18:52.598 --> 18:54.999
to our Thanksgiving feast?

18:55.134 --> 18:58.195
Yea, I accept in their behalf.

18:58.337 --> 19:00.601
As a matter of fact, to show you
what kind of sport I am...

19:00.740 --> 19:03.038
I think I'll bring
a kazooga along.

19:03.175 --> 19:04.836
- Oh, good.
- A kazooga!

19:04.977 --> 19:06.342
What's a kazooga?

19:06.479 --> 19:09.608
That's a surprise.
That's a surprise.

19:15.988 --> 19:16.887
Look!

19:17.023 --> 19:19.890
The John Aldens
have given us a pie

19:20.026 --> 19:21.653
for our Thanksgiving feast.

19:21.794 --> 19:24.320
Oh, uh, but, Father,

19:24.463 --> 19:26.898
there's only half a pie there.

19:27.033 --> 19:28.694
It was a long walk.

19:28.834 --> 19:30.461
I don't mind.

19:30.603 --> 19:34.506
Today is such a festive day,
nothing bothers me.

19:34.640 --> 19:35.835
(knocking on door)

19:35.975 --> 19:37.966
Ah, it's my getteth.

19:40.713 --> 19:42.681
- Hi there, Richard.
- Hail.

19:42.815 --> 19:44.442
We brought the, uh, chicken.

19:44.583 --> 19:47.052
Yes, the Plymouth Colonel

19:47.186 --> 19:49.177
was having
a Thanksgiving Day special.

19:49.321 --> 19:51.813
And I brought the cider.

19:51.957 --> 19:52.856
Hard?

19:52.992 --> 19:55.256
No, I rolled it part of the way.

19:56.595 --> 19:58.654
Mistress Cunningham,

19:58.798 --> 20:00.391
here are your chickens.

20:00.533 --> 20:01.864
- Thank you...
- Whoa!

20:02.001 --> 20:04.902
Oh, company's here.

20:05.037 --> 20:08.530
Must be Master Fonzie
and his friends.

20:09.542 --> 20:11.738
- Welcome. -Welcome.
- Welcome.

20:16.849 --> 20:20.342
Brave and noble Indians,

20:20.486 --> 20:23.251
we are honored

20:23.389 --> 20:26.324
to have you in...

20:26.459 --> 20:30.191
our humble home.

20:32.898 --> 20:34.457
What does he say, Master Fonzie?

20:34.600 --> 20:36.830
"Why can't you say 'greetings'
like everybody else?"

20:42.608 --> 20:44.440
And here is the kazooga
we promised you.

20:44.577 --> 20:46.841
Oh, it looks just like a turkey.

20:46.979 --> 20:50.074
Thank you very much, and won't
you all join our feast?

20:50.216 --> 20:52.207
(all agreeing)

20:55.287 --> 20:57.051
What does he say, Master Fonzie?

20:57.189 --> 20:59.624
He says he's glad to see
there's food on the table.

20:59.759 --> 21:01.124
He heard you had strange ways.

21:01.260 --> 21:04.093
He thought maybe he was going
to be the main course.

21:04.230 --> 21:07.256
Well, we certainly think alike.

21:07.399 --> 21:09.561
What do you think about kissing?

21:09.702 --> 21:11.602
Marion.

21:11.737 --> 21:12.704
Oh, yes, husband.

21:12.838 --> 21:14.829
Well, come join us, please.

21:16.842 --> 21:18.867
The bench.

21:19.011 --> 21:21.002
Sitteth.

21:25.117 --> 21:26.949
No, no, it's all right.
It's cool here.

21:27.086 --> 21:29.851
You see, it's their...
it's their custom.

21:29.989 --> 21:31.320
There's a great reverence
being close to the earth.

21:31.457 --> 21:34.324
ALL:
Ah.

21:34.460 --> 21:36.519
FONZIE:
Ah, excuse me.

21:36.662 --> 21:37.527
What?

21:37.663 --> 21:38.630
Oh, right, right, right.

21:38.764 --> 21:39.959
That's, uh,

21:40.099 --> 21:42.033
two drumsticks and a wing.

21:43.102 --> 21:44.126
Very little dressing.

21:44.270 --> 21:46.170
Now let us give thanks

21:46.305 --> 21:47.739
for our bountiful harvest.

21:47.873 --> 21:49.671
Master Richard?

21:49.809 --> 21:51.368
Thank you, 0, Lord,

21:51.510 --> 21:54.741
for leading us to this New World

21:54.880 --> 21:58.339
and thank you for the freedom

21:58.484 --> 22:01.215
that we can all share together.

22:01.353 --> 22:03.117
Amen.

22:03.255 --> 22:04.586
ALL:
Amen.

22:11.997 --> 22:16.093
The Indians and the Pilgrims
shared their bounteous feast

22:16.235 --> 22:17.930
and brotherhood,

22:18.070 --> 22:21.438
and that's what Thanksgiving
is about.

22:21.574 --> 22:23.565
I'm touched.

22:25.611 --> 22:27.841
But I'm sorry
that I lost my temper,

22:27.980 --> 22:29.345
and I promise all of you

22:29.481 --> 22:31.176
that I will never act
that way again.

22:31.317 --> 22:32.978
I ask for your forgiveness.

22:33.118 --> 22:36.520
Oh, sweetheart, we're the ones
who should be sorry.

22:36.655 --> 22:38.521
Yeah, Mom,
we just weren't thinking.

22:38.657 --> 22:40.216
Sorry, Mom.

22:40.359 --> 22:42.191
Ditto.

22:42.328 --> 22:43.693
Thank you.

22:43.829 --> 22:45.297
I feel so much better.

22:45.431 --> 22:47.024
- Pass the rolls.
- Yeah, right, right.

22:47.166 --> 22:50.227
You know, there's a lot
to say at Thanksgiving.

22:50.369 --> 22:53.100
A lot more than
"please pass the rolls"

22:53.239 --> 22:55.207
or "can I have the drumstick?"

22:55.341 --> 22:57.070
This is a day
to count your blessings.

22:57.209 --> 22:59.906
Everyone has something
to be thankful for.

23:00.045 --> 23:03.709
I have four big reasons.

23:03.849 --> 23:07.183
Howard, Joanie,
Richard and Arthur.

23:07.319 --> 23:09.515
I thank you all...

23:09.655 --> 23:12.249
for this house,

23:12.391 --> 23:13.950
this home,

23:14.093 --> 23:16.152
and for the love
that draws us close.

23:16.295 --> 23:19.925
(sighs)

23:20.065 --> 23:22.159
Well, I know beautiful words
when I hear them,

23:22.301 --> 23:24.770
and I say, to Mrs. C.

23:24.904 --> 23:26.303
- Mom. -To Mom.
- To Mrs. C.

23:27.706 --> 23:29.697
Oh, my-

23:33.445 --> 23:36.540
Sweetheart,
as long as you're up,

23:36.682 --> 23:38.776
would you like
to carve the kazooga?

23:38.918 --> 23:40.579
(laughter)

23:40.719 --> 23:44.155
Now, quick, before everything
gets cold.

23:53.699 --> 23:56.760
Ah, what a fine dinner that was.

23:56.902 --> 23:57.869
I'm so stuffed.

23:58.003 --> 24:01.564
I can't move an inch.

24:01.707 --> 24:02.606
That's good!

24:02.741 --> 24:04.072
That's bad. I got a heavy date.

24:04.209 --> 24:07.577
I can't operate in slow motion.

24:07.713 --> 24:09.511
No, "0. no, no, no!

24:09.648 --> 24:12.413
You just sit right down here
and relax.

24:12.551 --> 24:15.612
We are going
to clean up everything.

24:15.754 --> 24:17.188
- I'll wash.
- And I'll dry.

24:17.323 --> 24:18.586
And I'm gonna clear the table.

24:18.724 --> 24:22.092
I think I'll just stay
and keep Mrs. C. company.

24:22.227 --> 24:25.686
I think I'm gonna help
like you never saw.

24:25.831 --> 24:28.596
Now, sweetheart,

24:28.734 --> 24:31.465
you just go over there
and sitteth on the coucheth

24:31.603 --> 24:33.264
and watcheth the TV.

24:33.405 --> 24:36.136
We'll take care
of everything out here.

24:36.275 --> 24:37.902
Thank you. I'll do just that.

24:38.043 --> 24:40.740
I have the best family
in the world.

24:40.879 --> 24:43.780
Oh, you don't know how nice
it's gonna be

24:43.916 --> 24:47.079
to just sit here
and do nothing.

24:47.219 --> 24:49.745
Oh, Heidi's Still on.

24:51.824 --> 24:53.690
(dishes shattering)

24:53.826 --> 24:56.454
