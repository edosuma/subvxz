<i>Previously on</i> The Vampire Diaries...

00:03.463 --> 00:05.124
Bet you didn't see that coming.

00:05.126 --> 00:07.160
Go... to hell.

00:07.162 --> 00:09.028
You first.

00:11.666 --> 00:13.866
SELINE: <i>When the door
between this world and Cade's</i>

00:13.868 --> 00:17.263
<i>gets cracked open, it wipes
out everything for miles.</i>

00:17.266 --> 00:18.204
<i>In this case...</i>

00:18.206 --> 00:19.739
All of us in Mystic Falls.

00:19.741 --> 00:21.255
<i>All you got to do is make sure</i>

00:21.258 --> 00:22.709
<i>that bell rings 12 times.</i>

00:22.711 --> 00:25.378
I thought you had to figure things out.

00:25.380 --> 00:28.281
I couldn't see that everything
that I was looking for

00:28.283 --> 00:30.116
was right here in you.

00:30.118 --> 00:31.351
Will you marry me?

00:31.353 --> 00:32.719
Yes, of course.

00:33.955 --> 00:35.021
You didn't destroy hell.

00:35.023 --> 00:36.189
Thanks to you killing Cade,

00:36.191 --> 00:37.657
hell's never been in better hands.

00:37.659 --> 00:40.093
If Cade's not running hell, who is?

00:40.095 --> 00:42.362
The person who knows where
all your weak spots are.

00:42.364 --> 00:44.030
The one who wants revenge

00:44.032 --> 00:46.032
for what we did to her.

00:46.034 --> 00:47.700
Don't you dare say that name!

00:47.702 --> 00:49.502
The baddest bitch of all.

00:49.504 --> 00:51.838
Katherine.

Are you part of my Uber pool?

Oh, my God, you're...

01:43.725 --> 01:44.724
Hey.

01:44.726 --> 01:47.293
Hi.

01:49.197 --> 01:51.664
I know we have a lot to talk about,

01:51.666 --> 01:53.466
but I don't, I don't want to get into

01:53.468 --> 01:55.067
any of that right now.

01:55.069 --> 01:56.869
I don't want to talk about us or Enzo

01:56.871 --> 01:58.652
or Stefan or anything,

01:58.655 --> 02:00.740
except the trouble headed our way.

02:03.991 --> 02:06.238
You are gonna need this.

02:09.050 --> 02:11.384
So the victim was here until you closed.

02:11.386 --> 02:12.685
Did he say where he was going?

02:12.687 --> 02:14.353
If he was meeting up with anyone?

02:14.355 --> 02:15.688
No.

02:17.892 --> 02:19.863
- Give me a minute.
- Okay.

02:21.596 --> 02:23.963
- Dad, when did you get back?
- Just this morning.

02:23.965 --> 02:25.865
Hey, look, I would've called ahead,

02:25.867 --> 02:27.923
but I wanted to tell you in person.

02:27.926 --> 02:29.826
[door creaks open]

02:31.673 --> 02:33.306
Mom?

02:33.308 --> 02:34.907
Hi, Matty.

02:34.909 --> 02:36.709
Hey, I, uh, thought you were gonna

02:36.711 --> 02:38.338
give me a minute with him first.

02:38.341 --> 02:39.378
I saw you two talking.

02:39.380 --> 02:40.746
I couldn't wait to see my son.

02:40.748 --> 02:43.720
After waiting four years
since your last phone message?

02:43.723 --> 02:46.018
As I remember, I asked
you to call me back.

02:46.020 --> 02:48.087
Hey, look, look, I know it's sudden,

02:48.089 --> 02:50.189
but you gave me a second chance.

02:50.191 --> 02:51.757
Didn't turn out so bad, right?

02:51.759 --> 02:53.359
I thought you hated him for leaving us.

02:53.361 --> 02:55.661
That was a lifetime ago.

02:55.663 --> 02:57.129
Things have changed since then.

02:57.131 --> 02:59.765
I was... I was actually
glad to hear from him.

02:59.768 --> 03:01.683
I was hoping we could
all get dinner tonight.

03:01.686 --> 03:03.366
[phone chimes]

03:06.205 --> 03:08.614
I'm not sure I'll be free.

03:11.443 --> 03:13.443
All right, professor,

03:13.445 --> 03:15.378
how do we get rid of the queen of hell?

03:15.380 --> 03:17.271
Are you sure Katherine's in our world?

03:17.274 --> 03:19.850
When Cade crossed planes after
the 11th ring of the bell,

03:19.852 --> 03:21.451
other souls could step through, too.

03:21.453 --> 03:22.586
Same way Kai did.

03:22.588 --> 03:24.888
Katherine would have
jumped at that chance.

03:24.890 --> 03:26.990
Then why haven't we seen her yet?

03:26.992 --> 03:28.191
I thought by now she'd be

03:28.193 --> 03:30.060
strutting around, making demands,

03:30.062 --> 03:31.995
or trying to get us all killed.

03:31.997 --> 03:33.864
Maybe she's biding her time.

03:33.866 --> 03:35.757
Or putting her own plan together.

03:35.760 --> 03:37.501
Either way, you're
gonna need a new weapon.

03:37.503 --> 03:39.369
Is that Dorian?

03:39.371 --> 03:42.105
Yeah, I've asked Dorian to take point

03:42.107 --> 03:43.373
on our research front.

03:43.375 --> 03:45.575
This doesn't mean you and I are cool.

03:45.577 --> 03:47.811
I still have those files on you, so

03:47.813 --> 03:49.446
I'm here to hold you accountable

03:49.448 --> 03:50.914
for the rest of your God-given life.

03:50.916 --> 03:54.570
I hope that you do.

03:54.573 --> 03:56.419
So what have you guys come up with?

03:56.421 --> 03:59.422
Cade was killed with a dagger
that was made from his bones.

03:59.424 --> 04:01.658
It was fused into glass
by a white-hot flame.

04:01.660 --> 04:03.460
First things first, though,

04:03.462 --> 04:06.463
I don't suppose you know
where Katherine's bones are?

04:06.465 --> 04:08.754
Oh, who'd have ever thought
she'd have done us a favor?

04:08.757 --> 04:10.767
We've got every last
one of Katherine's bones

04:10.769 --> 04:11.894
in the cave,

04:11.897 --> 04:13.436
underneath the old church,

04:13.438 --> 04:15.105
left over from a traveler barbecue

04:15.107 --> 04:18.007
she had when she tried to possess Elena.

04:18.010 --> 04:20.577
But fusing the bones into glass...

04:20.579 --> 04:22.112
How do we make that kind of weapon?

04:22.113 --> 04:24.881
Would putting the bone in
a metal dagger do the trick?

04:24.883 --> 04:27.304
My parents are in town. I
could ask my dad for help.

04:27.307 --> 04:29.186
"Parents," plural?

04:29.188 --> 04:30.687
Unexpected family reunion,

04:30.689 --> 04:32.989
so now I've got two
nightmares to deal with.

04:32.991 --> 04:34.591
Gossip later, townies.

04:34.593 --> 04:37.222
Stefan and I will go
on bone-fetching duty.

04:37.225 --> 04:40.563
Dorian and I will research
an alternative to fight her.

04:40.566 --> 04:42.532
See, if Katherine's back,

04:42.534 --> 04:44.100
that means hell still exists.

04:44.102 --> 04:46.303
We need to figure out a way
to break her link to hell.

04:46.305 --> 04:49.206
BONNIE: These psychic dimensions
are tied to emotional trauma.

04:49.208 --> 04:51.708
Cade created his when he
was burned at the stake.

04:51.710 --> 04:56.246
I created mine... when
I saw Enzo get murdered.

04:56.958 --> 04:59.025
I'm just saying maybe there's a way

04:59.028 --> 05:00.650
to destroy the dimension itself.

05:00.652 --> 05:02.085
Destroying hell destroys her.

05:02.087 --> 05:05.488
Great. You guys are on
Hail Mary miracle duty,

05:05.490 --> 05:08.358
so how do the rest of us get
Katherine to show herself?

05:08.360 --> 05:09.860
Easy.

05:09.862 --> 05:11.328
She's obsessed with Stefan

05:11.330 --> 05:13.096
and insanely jealous.

05:13.098 --> 05:15.799
If she sees anyone making him happy,

05:15.801 --> 05:17.734
she won't be able to control herself.

05:17.736 --> 05:20.337
So she'll have no choice
but to come out of hiding.

05:20.339 --> 05:22.439
- Your point?
- My point is

05:22.441 --> 05:24.808
we shove Stefan's happiness in her face.

05:24.810 --> 05:28.044
We throw the one party
Katherine would never miss.

05:30.496 --> 05:32.496
Who doesn't love a wedding?

05:36.161 --> 05:38.169
Sure, Caroline, get married.

05:38.172 --> 05:40.290
The day you've dreamt
of your whole life,

05:40.292 --> 05:41.725
just throw it together like some

05:41.727 --> 05:43.360
shotgun Vegas wedding

05:43.362 --> 05:44.828
to lure out and murder your nemesis,

05:44.830 --> 05:46.496
all before the vows are over.

05:46.498 --> 05:49.032
Yeah, it's happening fast.

05:58.545 --> 06:01.686
I never got to explain to
you why I said yes to Stefan.

06:01.689 --> 06:04.547
I know why you said yes.

06:04.549 --> 06:07.186
You want to spend your life with him,

06:07.189 --> 06:08.755
in spite of everything.

06:10.589 --> 06:13.346
I get it, but

06:13.349 --> 06:15.182
I can't watch you marry him.

06:15.185 --> 06:18.720
Can't watch him be happy.

06:18.723 --> 06:21.031
And it's really hard for me to say

06:21.033 --> 06:23.466
that I won't be there with you.

06:23.468 --> 06:26.603
Because you know I would
do anything for you.

06:26.605 --> 06:29.506
I can't do that to myself.

06:29.508 --> 06:31.141
I won't.

06:35.314 --> 06:37.106
I understand.

06:40.419 --> 06:41.882
I'm so sorry.

06:43.255 --> 06:44.858
I'm sorry in ways

06:44.861 --> 06:47.316
that I didn't even know existed.

06:50.128 --> 06:52.729
I know that I am one step removed

06:52.731 --> 06:55.298
from the reason that you lost Enzo.

06:55.300 --> 06:59.469
So I am extremely grateful
that you're even sitting here

06:59.471 --> 07:01.170
being my friend right now.

07:03.241 --> 07:06.710
Bonnie, I love you so much.

07:06.712 --> 07:09.179
So much.

07:09.181 --> 07:10.443
Please know that.

07:10.446 --> 07:11.539
I do.

07:11.542 --> 07:13.742
I know you do.

07:21.893 --> 07:23.626
DAMON: How are those vows coming?

07:23.628 --> 07:27.397
I'm gonna go out on a limb and say that

07:27.399 --> 07:30.137
Katherine won't let the
ceremony get that far.

07:30.140 --> 07:32.435
Caroline and Bonnie are
probably already rehearsing.

07:32.437 --> 07:34.098
You don't want to seem unprepared.

07:39.111 --> 07:43.847
Look... what happened to Enzo

07:43.849 --> 07:45.815
is gonna haunt you

07:45.817 --> 07:47.450
and her for the rest of your lives.

07:47.452 --> 07:51.089
But the you standing with me right now,

07:51.092 --> 07:53.656
the you that's gonna marry
Caroline Forbes tomorrow,

07:53.658 --> 07:57.494
the you that I have known
for almost 200 years...

07:57.496 --> 07:59.062
You didn't do it.

08:00.198 --> 08:05.368
Evil, nasty, Ripper Stefan did it.

08:05.370 --> 08:07.103
And you are not him.

08:07.105 --> 08:09.806
You hear me?

08:09.808 --> 08:11.207
Yeah.

08:11.209 --> 08:13.343
Good.

08:15.013 --> 08:18.581
Did you know you can
get ordained online?

08:18.583 --> 08:20.283
DAMON: Did it this morning.

08:20.285 --> 08:24.487
You are looking at a bona
fide justice of the peace.

08:24.489 --> 08:26.356
[Damon groans]

08:26.358 --> 08:28.591
Rise and shine, kitty cat.

08:32.264 --> 08:34.496
Hi, I'm Katherine,

08:34.499 --> 08:36.698
the bitch that will destroy your lives

08:36.701 --> 08:39.736
for all eternity! [laughs]

08:39.738 --> 08:42.438
Uh, okay, why don't we
just, uh, get what we need

08:42.441 --> 08:43.673
and get out of here.

08:43.674 --> 08:45.475
It's pretty fitting, though.

08:45.477 --> 08:47.277
The woman that started this whole mess

08:47.279 --> 08:48.511
is back to try and end it.

08:48.513 --> 08:50.713
I wouldn't say it was all a mess.

08:50.715 --> 08:52.015
What are you talking about?

08:52.017 --> 08:54.184
Look at the path that she sent us down.

08:54.186 --> 08:57.699
Ripper sprees, the
Originals, the cure, Silas,

08:57.702 --> 08:59.527
- the Other Side...
- I'm just saying that...

08:59.530 --> 09:02.458
Prison worlds, Gemini twins, Heretics,

09:02.461 --> 09:04.260
and don't get me started on

09:04.262 --> 09:06.910
doppelgangers! [laughs]

09:06.913 --> 09:09.532
I'm just saying we had some good things

09:09.534 --> 09:11.468
happen to us, too, right?

09:11.470 --> 09:14.037
That's very glass-half-full
of you, brother.

09:14.039 --> 09:16.339
Well, I have to think
that way, otherwise I go

09:16.341 --> 09:18.652
- to a very dark place.
- All right, all right,

09:18.655 --> 09:21.222
before this turns into a sob-fest.

09:24.349 --> 09:26.427
Happy bachelor party, little brother.

09:29.646 --> 09:31.955
Oh, you can celebrate with us, too.

09:31.957 --> 09:34.157
[making chugging sounds]

09:34.964 --> 09:37.093
Sorry for the lack of
exotic dancers... you know,

09:37.095 --> 09:40.130
short notice and all.

09:40.132 --> 09:44.167
Oh, this place hasn't changed a bit.

09:44.169 --> 09:45.802
There's my table.

09:45.804 --> 09:48.171
Vicki used to fill my glass on the sly.

09:50.809 --> 09:52.108
Why are you really here?

09:55.280 --> 09:58.748
I've had a lot of time to
think these last few years.

09:58.750 --> 10:00.950
I stopped dwelling on the past.

10:00.952 --> 10:03.953
I want to do things better now.

10:03.955 --> 10:06.723
People do change, believe it or not.

10:09.995 --> 10:13.596
I know this is a lot for you, Matty.

10:13.598 --> 10:15.665
But I miss my family.

10:19.905 --> 10:22.372
[sniffles, chuckles]

10:23.945 --> 10:25.775
Don't worry, I won't get all weepy

10:25.777 --> 10:27.293
before the drinks arrive.

10:51.503 --> 10:53.970
TRUDY: She told me not to
post video, but screw her.

10:53.972 --> 10:57.840
Everyone should know what a slut she is.

10:57.842 --> 10:59.403
Uh, what is that?

11:00.395 --> 11:03.813
It's disgusting, isn't it?

11:03.815 --> 11:07.750
It's what happens when
you get older... and die,

11:07.752 --> 11:10.086
come back from hell.

11:10.088 --> 11:12.255
It's really rough on the body.

11:13.768 --> 11:16.593
But there is a short-term remedy.

11:16.595 --> 11:18.294
[screams]

11:38.568 --> 11:39.804
_

11:39.807 --> 11:42.631
_

11:43.897 --> 11:45.889
DAMON: All right, bulletin.

11:47.148 --> 11:49.215
Human Stefan is a lightweight.

11:49.218 --> 11:50.467
Damon.

11:50.470 --> 11:52.653

- This is not my fault, Caroline.

Oh, please, don't be
mad at me, Caroline.

12:01.163 --> 12:04.198
I'm not mad at you.

12:04.200 --> 12:06.266
Thank you for my present, by the way.

12:07.069 --> 12:08.635
Looks like I am gonna need

12:08.637 --> 12:09.870
a new drinking buddy.

12:09.872 --> 12:11.071
Pass.

12:11.073 --> 12:12.606
Oh, come on.

12:12.608 --> 12:14.141
It's your last night as a single gal.

12:14.143 --> 12:16.076
Let's blow this popsicle stand.

12:16.078 --> 12:17.544
- [groans]
- No.

12:17.546 --> 12:19.980
That is a $10,000 rug.

Psst.

12:48.744 --> 12:52.779
Perhaps you should consider
a less melancholy playlist.

Helps me stay connected to you.

12:56.151 --> 12:58.285
[exhales]

12:58.287 --> 13:01.722
You don't need pain to
keep our connection alive.

13:01.724 --> 13:03.156
You are a witch, after all.

13:03.158 --> 13:05.792
A witch who can't do magic.

13:05.794 --> 13:07.528
What do you call my presence, then?

13:16.338 --> 13:18.872
Clearly, I'm not a hallucination.

13:18.874 --> 13:21.642
There has to be magic involved;

13:21.644 --> 13:24.678
therefore, you don't need pain.

13:24.680 --> 13:26.213
Therefore, you can attend the wedding

13:26.215 --> 13:28.015
without fear of losing your link to me.

13:28.017 --> 13:30.918
That's not why I'm skipping the wedding.

13:30.920 --> 13:32.653
Stefan murdered you.

13:32.655 --> 13:35.322
That version of Stefan

13:35.324 --> 13:37.891
died when you gave him the cure.

13:37.893 --> 13:40.494
The real Stefan is back.

13:40.496 --> 13:42.400
He's the one who's
getting married tomorrow.

13:42.403 --> 13:45.966
Maybe when I'm dead I'll
be as evolved as you,

13:45.968 --> 13:49.570
but that is not how I feel about him.

13:52.103 --> 13:53.740
Then trust Caroline.

13:55.711 --> 13:59.413
Trust how she feels.

13:59.415 --> 14:01.148
Share in her happiness.

14:01.150 --> 14:02.849
It won't negate ours.

14:07.423 --> 14:09.723
Are you actually happy?

14:09.725 --> 14:12.693
Certainly, luv.

I'm imagining us next to
a little church I remember

14:19.435 --> 14:21.668

14:21.670 --> 14:23.971
It's in the middle of a lavender field.

14:23.973 --> 14:27.207
I always thought it would be
the perfect place to marry you.

14:29.676 --> 14:33.473
And after our wedding, we'd dance.

14:36.456 --> 14:40.354
And I'd tell you how much I love you.

14:40.356 --> 14:43.056
And I'd tell you the absolute truth,

14:43.059 --> 14:46.761
which is I'm the luckiest
man on the face of the Earth.

14:59.274 --> 15:01.808
All right. I got one more.

15:01.810 --> 15:05.212
No. No more practice speeches.

15:17.393 --> 15:20.427
and became one of my closest friends.

15:20.429 --> 15:24.164
She was strong. She was loving.

15:24.166 --> 15:26.266
And not only did she protect this town,

15:26.268 --> 15:28.335
but she raised an incredible daughter...

15:28.337 --> 15:30.437
[lightly chuckles]

15:30.439 --> 15:33.840
...that I now get to call family.

I hate that she is not here.

And Bonnie's not coming,

Elena won't be there.

16:02.104 --> 16:03.336
Hold that thought.

16:03.338 --> 16:08.108
So, I remember when you gave me this...

16:08.110 --> 16:09.476
at Christmas.

16:09.478 --> 16:10.811
You said it was for future me.

16:10.813 --> 16:13.480
A guy who'd one day ask
for your forgiveness.

16:13.482 --> 16:15.164
Is this you asking?

16:15.167 --> 16:18.551
Let's save that for another
Salvatore bonding night,

16:18.554 --> 16:20.554
- why don't we?
- [chuckles]

16:22.887 --> 16:24.491
I just wanted you to know that Elena

16:24.493 --> 16:26.660
would be with you tomorrow.

16:31.300 --> 16:34.301
But just so we're clear...

16:34.303 --> 16:36.036
I want that back.

16:36.038 --> 16:38.338
[laughs]

16:38.340 --> 16:40.974
Something borrowed.

16:40.976 --> 16:42.576

Oh, you girls look amazing.

17:53.436 --> 17:54.702
Ooh.

would smell a rat

18:02.178 --> 18:06.414
So... Stefan called in
a favor from Valerie.

18:06.417 --> 18:08.549
It turns out she has a
soft spot for Gemini twins.

18:08.551 --> 18:10.985
She put a protection spell on them,

18:10.987 --> 18:12.887
so they'll be safe no matter what.

Thank you for bringing them.

make from Katherine's bones.

I didn't think he'd want
to involve you in all this.

20:00.696 --> 20:02.296
Well, if we're gonna be a family again,

20:02.298 --> 20:04.365
we need to be honest with each other.

20:07.036 --> 20:08.435
Okay, then yes.

20:08.437 --> 20:10.471
Yeah, I... I finished
in time to take a shower

20:10.473 --> 20:11.939
so I could get here a little early.

20:11.941 --> 20:14.274
And where's the dagger?

Hey, are you okay?

Honestly, no.

20:36.032 --> 20:37.631
Maybe I should hold onto that.

No, I'm the bait. I should.

20:41.103 --> 20:44.438
Hey.

20:44.440 --> 20:47.741
Know this.

20:47.743 --> 20:49.843
If she lays a hand on you,

20:49.845 --> 20:52.212
I will cut her up into
tiny, little pieces

20:52.214 --> 20:56.617
and I will serve her
at the wedding buffet.

this one day with Elena.

the number of compelled guests.

CAROLINE: You girls will
go in front of Mommy,

22:14.525 --> 22:17.993
and then Mommy will just
walk herself down the aisle,

[exhales] Check this out.
So I've been reading about

23:26.113 --> 23:29.288
psychic energy manipulation.
If we could create

23:29.290 --> 23:31.690
a massive amount of energy that breaches

23:31.692 --> 23:33.725
the psychic plane of hell,

23:33.727 --> 23:35.427
we might be able to destroy it.

23:35.429 --> 23:37.296
Kind of like how they
blow out oil well fires

23:37.298 --> 23:39.307

23:39.310 --> 23:41.400
Except our explosion would be made

You know what? You look
like you need bourbon.

23:58.485 --> 24:01.420
I should find some bourbon.

24:01.422 --> 24:03.589
Did I ever tell you why
I came to Mystic Falls?

24:05.192 --> 24:06.992
I was hunting Damon.

24:09.330 --> 24:11.864
He had killed my first wife.

24:11.866 --> 24:15.734
Then I found out he had turned her,

24:15.736 --> 24:20.105
and that was what she wanted.

24:23.510 --> 24:26.144
Eventually, I got past that.

24:26.146 --> 24:28.013
How?

24:28.015 --> 24:33.018
I guess I didn't have the
energy to hate somebody forever.

The strange thing is...

25:11.492 --> 25:16.328
losing those people is
what brought us together.

25:16.330 --> 25:18.497
It's how we found each other.
