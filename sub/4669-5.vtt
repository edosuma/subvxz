Captain, here's the man
you were looking for.

00:32.457 --> 00:33.991
That's you, eh?

00:35.470 --> 00:37.338
Thought you'd be uglier.

00:37.363 --> 00:38.829
How did you get a submarine?

00:38.854 --> 00:41.654
[Chuckles] Yeah.

00:41.778 --> 00:43.244
Bit of a fluke, really.

00:43.269 --> 00:45.340
I was coxswain on her
less than six months ago.

00:45.365 --> 00:47.371
- Believe that?
- But then...

00:47.373 --> 00:49.506
Watch it. Sorry, mate.

00:49.531 --> 00:51.183
Then...

00:51.544 --> 00:53.944
That lovely little germ stowed away

00:53.946 --> 00:55.612
in some lieutenant's lungs.

00:55.614 --> 00:58.885
Next thing we know, the whole
crew were droppin' like flies.

00:58.910 --> 01:03.420
But me and me brother, no. Not us.

01:13.833 --> 01:17.526
"You're a lucky old git, Sean
Ramsey," I says to myself.

01:17.551 --> 01:20.537
But then... Then... Then...

01:20.562 --> 01:22.462
[Lowered voice] I had myself...

01:23.985 --> 01:26.420
My moment of revelation.

01:42.284 --> 01:44.784
- Design, mate.
- Yeah.

01:45.156 --> 01:47.120
That's what this is.

01:47.154 --> 01:48.754
- Mm-hmm.
- Design.

01:49.554 --> 01:51.712
Yeah.

01:52.586 --> 01:55.116
So, all's I had to do then

01:55.141 --> 01:57.944
was find a few people like us.

01:57.969 --> 01:59.276
- Immunes.
- Right.

01:59.278 --> 02:01.647
Train a crew to help me run this thing.

02:01.672 --> 02:05.883

02:38.455 --> 02:39.587
The man's our guest

02:39.612 --> 02:41.016

02:41.041 --> 02:43.174

I don't trust him.

He's our guest.

02:58.783 --> 03:00.985
Still nothing on sonar, sir.

03:01.010 --> 03:02.214
If they're submerged

03:02.239 --> 03:03.972
on the opposite side of the Northern Bank,

03:04.216 --> 03:05.782
we'll see them as soon
as we're far enough south

03:05.807 --> 03:07.089
to peer behind it.

03:07.114 --> 03:09.047

Sir?

03:16.306 --> 03:18.139
Anything?

03:18.422 --> 03:23.405
Only one thing I hate more than
seeing a submarine on sonar.

03:23.547 --> 03:24.746
What's that?

03:24.771 --> 03:27.605
Not seeing one.

03:31.062 --> 03:33.343
There's nothing behind the bank, sir.

03:34.472 --> 03:36.373
They must've hightailed it outta here.

03:36.375 --> 03:38.609
Yeah, but why? Where?

03:38.611 --> 03:40.298
Maybe our prisoner can enlighten us.

He conscious?

03:41.567 --> 03:43.761
Weak, but conscious.

quiet has gotta be a sub.

09:38.691 --> 09:41.792
I agree, sir, but something this quiet...

It... it must be a type 2-1-4.

Juan Carlos said it was
an <i>Astute</i> class.

09:46.107 --> 09:47.698

09:47.723 --> 09:49.323
If it were fitted with
the new sound matting.

09:49.609 --> 09:51.375

could barely hear its engine.

- No.

Ain't no freighters doing
business during an apocalypse.

10:28.177 --> 10:30.589
That ship ain't going slow
'cause it's underpowered.

It's going slow so's to be quiet.

10:38.832 --> 10:40.532
Calculate range and intercept.

10:40.557 --> 10:41.823
Calculating range, aye.

10:41.950 --> 10:43.446
Arm torpedoes.

10:43.471 --> 10:45.246
Arming torpedoes, aye.

10:53.869 --> 10:57.338
[Sonar pinging steadily]

10:59.740 --> 11:00.907
It's shallow where she is.

11:00.932 --> 11:02.198
I think I'm getting some kick

11:02.223 --> 11:03.658
from her prop off the sea bottom.

11:03.683 --> 11:05.857
How shallow?

11:07.141 --> 11:09.049
A guess, sir.

11:09.074 --> 11:11.330
I-I'd say 400 feet or less.

11:11.355 --> 11:13.022
Anybody else out there?

11:13.541 --> 11:16.000
I mean, I've got some biologics,
maybe 8, 10 miles south.

11:16.025 --> 11:17.959
Porpoises, maybe. Probably dolphins.

11:18.403 --> 11:21.068
Gate, if you follow
the bearing 2-3-5 out,

11:21.093 --> 11:22.496
where does it get that shallow?

11:22.521 --> 11:24.744
Uh, North end of the Bahama Bank,

11:24.769 --> 11:25.885
west of the islands, sir.

11:25.910 --> 11:27.142
That fit with what you're getting?

11:27.167 --> 11:30.142
Yes, sir. That would put
them roughly 50 miles out,

11:30.167 --> 11:32.712
and based on, uh, how much
louder they're getting, sir,

11:32.737 --> 11:35.460
I'd say they're heading... 0-7-5.

11:35.485 --> 11:37.041
Ballpark C.P.A.?

11:37.370 --> 11:40.041
Closest point of approach would be, um...

11:42.908 --> 11:44.588
We're near collision course now, sir.

11:44.613 --> 11:47.087
[Radio chatter]

11:47.622 --> 11:49.321
We don't know if he's seen us yet.

11:54.665 --> 11:56.387
[Beeps]

11:56.412 --> 11:58.512
Bridge, captain.

11:58.568 --> 12:00.168
<i>Try 20 degrees starboard.</i>

12:00.193 --> 12:02.087
20 degrees starboard, aye.

12:02.112 --> 12:03.579
See if he's paying attention.

12:04.676 --> 12:08.387
[Whirring]

12:20.635 --> 12:22.932
[Sonar pinging steadily]

12:43.673 --> 12:47.072
They're turning, too, sir.
They're turning to intercept.

12:50.375 --> 12:52.275
Ned: You see that?

12:52.300 --> 12:53.781
They're turning 'cause they see us.

12:53.806 --> 12:55.539
They're running. That's them. I know.

12:55.564 --> 12:56.735
What are you waitin' for?!

12:56.760 --> 12:58.626
Mind your P's and Q's, Ned.

12:59.490 --> 13:01.892
Sir, if he's an <i>Astute</i>
class, he's carrying a Spearfish,

13:01.917 --> 13:03.422
which means we're already in his range.

13:03.447 --> 13:04.847
I am aware of that.

13:04.872 --> 13:06.705
How long until we can hit him?

13:07.715 --> 13:10.821
At the rate we're closing,
almost another half hour.

13:12.042 --> 13:13.821
Are you expecting him to fire, sir?

13:13.846 --> 13:15.622
Not if he wants the cure.

13:15.647 --> 13:16.821
We don't want anything from him.

13:16.846 --> 13:19.013
We could fire first once we're in range.

13:19.038 --> 13:21.321
The instant we fire, we
give up our exact position.

13:21.346 --> 13:24.622
I know, sir, but what's the alternative?

13:27.911 --> 13:29.847
I'm working on it.

13:30.177 --> 13:32.847
We'll be in their fire range
in less than 30 minutes.

13:32.872 --> 13:35.247
Get your finger out! Come on!

13:36.042 --> 13:37.308
Well, you heard him.

13:37.333 --> 13:38.930
Let's blow their asses out the water.

13:38.955 --> 13:41.322
We need to get closer so as
we can pick up Juan Carlos.

13:41.337 --> 13:44.655
What? For all we know, Juan Carlos is dead.

13:44.680 --> 13:45.773
The way he was shot up,

13:45.775 --> 13:47.383
how's he supposed to
get off the ship anyway?

13:47.408 --> 13:48.382
He'll find a way.

13:48.407 --> 13:50.373
We don't even know if he's loyal!

13:50.398 --> 13:52.023
He could be sellin' us out,

13:52.048 --> 13:54.245
begging and groveling as we speak.

13:54.688 --> 13:57.993
It's not a question of loyalty, Ned.

13:58.018 --> 14:01.594
He's a believer, same as the rest of us.

14:03.171 --> 14:05.960
Your sub is closing on
us. What do they want?

14:05.985 --> 14:08.960
What do you mean? For the cure.
Are they gonna offer us a deal?

14:08.985 --> 14:11.660
No, no. They thought the
cure was on <i>Solace.</i>

14:11.685 --> 14:15.513
When... when we didn't find
it, the commander's brother,

14:15.538 --> 14:18.511
he became certain that
the cure was just a rumor.

14:18.536 --> 14:22.138
As far as they know, this is
just a floating warship, sir.

14:22.163 --> 14:24.511
[Coughs] So then why
are they comin' for us?

14:24.536 --> 14:27.737
[Breathes heavily] I don't know.

14:27.762 --> 14:29.336
It must be for revenge,

14:29.466 --> 14:31.047
for his men you killed on <i>Solace.</i>

14:31.072 --> 14:32.972
Not to rescue you?

14:33.149 --> 14:35.020
They don't care about me.

14:35.045 --> 14:36.845
He cares enough to avenge his other men.

14:36.870 --> 14:39.210
You got the better of him.

14:39.235 --> 14:42.210
Now he needs to fix that.

14:42.575 --> 14:44.611
[Coughing]

14:44.636 --> 14:47.611
He's in range, hasn't fired
yet. What do you make of that?

14:48.478 --> 14:50.878
He knows you have countermeasures.

14:50.920 --> 14:53.451
He wants to make sure he's
close enough to hit you.

14:53.476 --> 14:55.774
Uh-huh. Pretty soon, he'll
be within <i>our</i> range.

14:55.799 --> 14:58.074
The insane fear nothing.

14:58.350 --> 15:03.117
Sir, I have been cooperative. Have I not?

15:03.142 --> 15:04.717
- I...
- [Handcuff clinks]

15:04.742 --> 15:06.942
May I make one request, please?

15:07.390 --> 15:09.963
I speak to you as one sailor to another.

15:09.988 --> 15:11.618
I am a man of honor.

15:11.861 --> 15:15.064
If they engage you, if
they want to sink you...

15:15.089 --> 15:18.657
and they most certainly will... [Coughs]

15:18.682 --> 15:22.263
I don't wanna drown like
this, handcuffed to a bed.

15:22.288 --> 15:23.915
I swear to you,

15:23.940 --> 15:26.486
I won't jeopardize the safety of your ship.

15:26.743 --> 15:28.585
Take me outside.

15:28.610 --> 15:31.330
Above decks, please.

15:31.524 --> 15:34.592
I will tell you everything I know

15:34.617 --> 15:37.505
about every single member of that crew.

15:37.530 --> 15:39.063
[Coughs]

15:39.120 --> 15:40.486
Slattery: If they wanted to negotiate,

15:40.511 --> 15:42.305
they're well within
range to reach out to us.

15:42.330 --> 15:45.305
Their bridge to bridge. Morse code, even.

15:45.330 --> 15:46.696
They're gonna try to sink us.

15:46.721 --> 15:48.305
We go to quiet two.

15:48.644 --> 15:51.384
Turn southeast toward
the North Bahama Bank.

15:51.417 --> 15:52.850
Even at dead slow,

15:52.875 --> 15:55.976
we may lose them just long
enough to get behind the shoal.

15:56.061 --> 15:58.387
If he chases us in the blind,

15:58.412 --> 16:00.985
we send our helo, drop a few
torpedoes down their throats.

16:01.010 --> 16:03.978
Yeah, if he knows we've
slowed, he might just fire.

16:03.980 --> 16:07.087
At 4 knots, we'll have almost
no maneuverability to evade.

16:07.112 --> 16:08.287
You got a better move?

16:08.312 --> 16:10.626
Yeah, we fire first, take
our chances at a dogfight.

16:10.651 --> 16:12.525
You'd bet on me.

16:12.647 --> 16:14.666
Against a sub with Spearfish?

16:16.095 --> 16:18.662
Bet on you so far.

16:23.344 --> 16:27.314
[Radio chatter]

16:29.984 --> 16:32.652
[Indistinct conversations]

16:34.050 --> 16:36.217
Alert all hands.

16:36.242 --> 16:38.090
We're going to quiet two.

16:38.115 --> 16:42.186
[Indistinct conversations continue]

16:42.211 --> 16:43.986
Yes, sir.

16:54.041 --> 16:56.406
All stations T.A.O.
We're going to quiet two.

16:56.431 --> 16:59.750
O.O.D. Helmsman, drop to 4 knots.

16:59.774 --> 17:02.546
[Beeping]

17:02.571 --> 17:04.946
All engines ahead one-third for 4 knots.

17:04.972 --> 17:08.247
[Whirring slows]

17:11.156 --> 17:13.946
Emcon Alpha set throughout the ship.

17:27.580 --> 17:28.915
[Beeps]

17:28.940 --> 17:31.321
Now hear this...

17:32.592 --> 17:35.494
<i>This is the last 1mc
message for a while.</i>

17:35.519 --> 17:36.708
<i>As of this moment,</i>

17:36.733 --> 17:38.099
we're going to quiet two,

17:38.124 --> 17:39.907
all personnel, quiet two.

17:39.932 --> 17:42.607
[Clanks, whirring slows]

17:42.632 --> 17:43.999
<i>You all know your jobs.</i>

17:44.024 --> 17:46.506
<i>We've drilled this
drill a hundred times.</i>

17:46.531 --> 17:50.566
<i>But a footstep could
give away our position.</i>

17:50.591 --> 17:54.306
This one's for real. Lock it down.

17:54.331 --> 17:56.406
<i>Ahead slow.</i>

17:56.431 --> 18:00.006
<i>Silence, fore and aft.</i>

18:02.050 --> 18:04.806
Chung: No talking or moving, okay?

18:05.787 --> 18:08.107
Don't talk, don't move
until further orders.

18:08.132 --> 18:09.607
Tight as a drum, guys.

18:09.632 --> 18:12.006
Nothing moves.

18:12.797 --> 18:15.607
Not even you. Down.

18:15.632 --> 18:18.607
- There you go. Just like Frankie taught you.
- [Whimpers]

18:18.632 --> 18:19.911
[Whispers] Stay.

18:42.268 --> 18:44.602
[Taps keys]

18:44.627 --> 18:48.264
I told you. I told you!
Look, what did I say?

18:48.289 --> 18:53.064
Now look at that. Nothing
there! Silent ship! Gone!

18:53.600 --> 18:57.864
We should've taken the
shot! Now look at us!

19:00.688 --> 19:03.023
We should bloody well fire
off a dozen their ways.

19:03.048 --> 19:04.677
What? And hit 'em with dumb luck?

19:04.702 --> 19:06.177
And if we miss, what then?

19:06.202 --> 19:08.730
They killed seven of my men!

19:08.755 --> 19:11.856
Your men? <i>Your</i> men?

19:16.758 --> 19:19.081
How far to the Bahama
Bank, the North Shore?

19:19.106 --> 19:22.909
- 40 miles out, sir.
- Make a course, 0-3-0.

19:22.934 --> 19:24.500
Man: Right, 0-3-0.

19:24.525 --> 19:26.409
If he's going behind the island,

19:26.434 --> 19:28.634
- we'll meet him on the far side.
- Aye, sir.

19:28.659 --> 19:31.639
Patience, brother. Patience.

19:31.993 --> 19:35.094
His time will come.

19:55.703 --> 19:58.538
[Mouths words]

20:34.446 --> 20:36.927
[Exhales softly]

20:40.787 --> 20:45.026
- Sean: Is he back here, then?
- Man: Yes, sir. Hard at work.

20:45.124 --> 20:47.791
So, what'd you find?

20:47.816 --> 20:52.061
Well, the hospital ship was
the right place, as I thought.

20:52.086 --> 20:56.250
But it's a real pity that
your men had to run away

20:56.275 --> 20:58.075
before we got what we need.

20:58.903 --> 21:02.676
You are very fortunate
that I am here, you know?

21:02.701 --> 21:04.851
The Americans were preparing seriously

21:04.876 --> 21:06.351
for a delivery of the cure.

21:06.376 --> 21:07.551
We'll handle that.

21:07.576 --> 21:09.950
Yeah? What do you mean?

21:12.329 --> 21:13.763
[Coffeepot clatters]

21:13.788 --> 21:16.024
- We're gonna sink that Yankee ship.
- [Chuckles]

21:16.049 --> 21:17.648
How?

21:17.673 --> 21:21.024
Without a ship, their plans just collapse.

21:21.049 --> 21:23.492
What? No, I... that's...

21:23.517 --> 21:24.923
You said so yourself.

21:24.948 --> 21:27.391
Their captain is smart and dangerous,

21:27.416 --> 21:30.091
so he won't surrender,
but he can't beat me,

21:30.116 --> 21:32.192
not in the open sea.

21:32.217 --> 21:34.591
His ship sinks.

21:35.643 --> 21:37.891
Hey, fret not.

21:37.916 --> 21:40.249
There'll be survivors.

21:40.274 --> 21:43.591
Maybe even that precious doctor of yours.

21:43.891 --> 21:46.591
If she's as important as you say,

21:46.616 --> 21:49.591
they'll put her on the first lifeboat.

21:49.616 --> 21:53.413
Uh, yeah, I suppose that's
true, but it's so risky.

21:53.471 --> 21:55.814
Not with my man on that ship.

21:56.307 --> 21:59.413
Special operator first class.

21:59.438 --> 22:03.540
That ship goes down,
he'll find a way off it.

22:03.565 --> 22:07.400
Make no mistake, we'll have what we need.

22:11.359 --> 22:13.487
Sir, are we allowed to
talk? [Inhales deeply]

22:13.512 --> 22:14.987
Yeah, sound dissipates in the air.

22:15.012 --> 22:17.087
Sub can't hear what's going on on deck.

22:17.112 --> 22:20.087
[Sniffs, exhales]

22:21.211 --> 22:24.886
We are going much slower,
yes? Running more quiet?

22:24.911 --> 22:26.386
[Sneezes, coughs]

22:27.358 --> 22:29.686
Here. No, gracias.

22:30.021 --> 22:32.386
- [Continues coughing]
- I know you smoke.

22:32.411 --> 22:34.611
Seen your nicotine-stained fingers.

22:35.056 --> 22:36.886
Smelled your clothes.

22:36.918 --> 22:38.831
Just... [exhales sharply]

22:38.856 --> 22:41.190
Just some water, please.

22:41.776 --> 22:44.644
- [Coughing]
- Unh-unh.

22:47.829 --> 22:51.531
[Stifles cough, exhales sharply]

22:51.556 --> 22:55.491
[Continues coughing]

22:55.516 --> 22:57.817
[Gargles, spits]

22:57.842 --> 22:59.766
Water for information.

23:00.225 --> 23:02.926
[Coughing]

23:03.069 --> 23:05.766
What more do you want to know?

23:05.791 --> 23:07.865
What's our range?

23:08.138 --> 23:10.639
[Sonar pinging steadily]

23:10.664 --> 23:12.697
I put them...

23:15.650 --> 23:17.467
Just inside 40 miles, sir.

23:17.491 --> 23:19.524
Gator: Sir, they've turned North.

23:19.549 --> 23:21.666
They're moving to the same
side of the bank as we are.

23:21.691 --> 23:24.065
Must've figured we were trying
to put the shoal between us.

23:24.090 --> 23:25.558
Sir, we won't get any of
the bank between us now

23:25.583 --> 23:26.857
unless we increase our speed.

23:26.882 --> 23:29.256
Sir, if we increase our
speed, they'll hear us.

23:30.544 --> 23:32.745
Just a few more minutes.

23:34.015 --> 23:36.456
And how did you all avoid being infected?

23:36.481 --> 23:39.456
[Coughing]

23:39.719 --> 23:42.756
I've told you so much information already.

23:42.781 --> 23:45.157
Please, give me some water.

23:45.221 --> 23:47.902
- [Breathing heavily]
- Come on.

23:47.927 --> 23:53.130
[Panting]

23:53.155 --> 23:54.922
[Spits]

23:54.947 --> 23:56.296
[Gagging]

23:56.321 --> 24:00.195
What's going on with
you? What are you doing?

24:00.220 --> 24:02.596
There must've been something inside him.

24:02.621 --> 24:04.096
That's why he's bleeding.

24:04.121 --> 24:05.902
- [Continues gagging]
- That's why he was holding his chest.

24:05.927 --> 24:09.441
That's why he wanted up
on deck. Must be a beacon.

24:09.466 --> 24:11.425
- What do you got in there, huh? A little homing device?
- [Groaning]

24:11.450 --> 24:12.716
Is that what that is?!

24:12.741 --> 24:14.974
There's nothing you can do about it now.

24:14.999 --> 24:16.927
My people know exactly where you are.

24:16.952 --> 24:19.230
Oh, they're <i>your</i>
people now? Is that right?

24:19.255 --> 24:21.656
Yeah. My people.

24:21.681 --> 24:25.930
We have already taken Europe, all of it.

24:26.281 --> 24:28.930
The people like me.

24:29.135 --> 24:30.535
[Gasps]

24:30.560 --> 24:34.630
On my ship, they all... Like me.

24:34.655 --> 24:37.556
[Gags] All... Like me.

24:37.581 --> 24:39.130
<i>Sobreviveremos.</i>

24:39.155 --> 24:42.731
<i>Sobreviveremos.</i> [Gasps]

24:46.771 --> 24:49.774
[Gasping, speaking Spanish]

24:49.799 --> 24:51.473
No! [Groans]

24:51.896 --> 24:54.774
[Grunting]

25:06.613 --> 25:09.666
- What's going on here?
- [Whooshing]

25:10.148 --> 25:12.339
- [Groans]
- Rios: You're right.

25:12.365 --> 25:13.998
There's something there.
It's causing damage.

25:14.023 --> 25:15.910
We have to open him up.
You're the most qualified.

25:16.690 --> 25:18.479
- What? Here?
- Can't take him below decks,

25:18.504 --> 25:20.363
not while he's thrashing around like that.

25:20.388 --> 25:21.933
- Sedating him.
- Aah!

25:21.958 --> 25:24.667
- Shh! Quiet!
- I'm not in the habit of operating on somebody

25:24.692 --> 25:26.403
who's clearly resistant to help.

25:26.428 --> 25:28.428
I'm not even sure that it's legal!

25:28.453 --> 25:30.720
Legal? According to who?

25:30.852 --> 25:33.786
He could've been broadcasting
to an enemy sub this whole time.

25:33.811 --> 25:36.603
Blood pressure's dropping.
Pulse is 125 and weak.

25:36.628 --> 25:37.861
He's bleeding internally now.

25:37.886 --> 25:39.552
Well, looks like he's gonna die anyway.

25:39.577 --> 25:41.477
Why we wasting our time
trying to cut it out of him?

25:41.502 --> 25:42.738
We should just throw him overboard.

25:42.763 --> 25:44.362
That certainly would be the
most expedient thing to do.

25:44.387 --> 25:46.902
All right, all right, I will do it.

25:47.696 --> 25:49.529
- Where's the equipment?
- I'll get it.

25:49.554 --> 25:52.828
Rachel: Let's move him. Need some help.

26:00.257 --> 26:03.125
[Mouths words]

26:35.066 --> 26:36.934
Rios: Do you see it?

26:36.959 --> 26:38.086
Rachel: Not yet.

26:38.874 --> 26:40.740
It's an incredibly large bleed.

26:41.116 --> 26:43.186
We don't have time to blood type him.

26:43.751 --> 26:46.590
We have a universal blood donor on board?

26:46.638 --> 26:49.597
Somebody with O-Negative blood?

26:51.856 --> 26:53.600
Hell, he can have my damn kidney

26:53.625 --> 26:55.258
if it'll get that thing
out of there any quicker.

26:55.283 --> 26:57.049
Give me a needle.

26:57.074 --> 27:00.109
Where is he? How many miles out?

27:00.134 --> 27:01.900
Mason: I put them...

27:01.925 --> 27:03.692
[Pinging continues steadily]

27:03.743 --> 27:05.709
Just inside 40 miles, sir.

27:06.109 --> 27:10.645
And that beacon could
easily have a 30-mile range.

27:11.470 --> 27:15.373
- Green deck. Get the helo in the air.
- Yes, sir.

27:19.304 --> 27:22.632
Bridge, set flight
quarters. Helo's cleared.

27:22.657 --> 27:23.889
Green deck.

27:23.914 --> 27:28.385
[Helicopter blades whirring, radio chatter]

27:29.149 --> 27:32.541
[Radio chatter continues]

27:33.456 --> 27:37.340
T.A.O., have bridge come to course 0-1-0.

27:37.365 --> 27:38.631
T.A.O.I.

27:39.015 --> 27:41.541
North, sir? For open water?

27:41.566 --> 27:43.399
Let's see if we can do
it without him hearing.

27:44.305 --> 27:46.073
T.A.O.,

27:46.193 --> 27:48.593
5-degree increments,

27:48.829 --> 27:51.497
10 to 15 seconds apart,

27:51.522 --> 27:53.241
randomly.

27:53.266 --> 27:55.041
Yes, sir.

27:55.866 --> 27:59.200
We might just sound like those porpoises.

27:59.781 --> 28:02.241
Rachel: It's punctured the esophagus.

28:02.985 --> 28:05.986
Currently lodged in the wall
of the lower left carotid,

28:06.011 --> 28:08.062
just about the union
at the ascending aorta.

28:08.087 --> 28:10.066
We need to get a suture in the artery wall

28:10.091 --> 28:12.866
before we remove it or he'll
die as soon as it comes out.

28:12.891 --> 28:16.459
Number 6 suture on a 5-inch hemostat.

28:16.484 --> 28:18.866
Bayonet forceps.

28:20.278 --> 28:21.878
Thank you.

28:21.903 --> 28:24.515
Man: We're not doing nothing
if I can't hear shite!

28:24.540 --> 28:26.277
Max: Why don't you grow a set, would you?

28:26.302 --> 28:27.784
We fire now, he won't...

28:27.809 --> 28:30.017
At what? Fire at what, you moppet?

28:30.042 --> 28:32.476
- Are you...
- I said shut it! Shut it!

28:32.774 --> 28:34.340
There's still a chain of command here!

28:34.365 --> 28:36.466
Enough! I don't want to hear any more

28:36.491 --> 28:39.127
of your bloody squawking, all right?

28:39.152 --> 28:41.785
Now, what are the options? Sonar?

28:41.873 --> 28:43.181
Still no signal on passive.

28:43.206 --> 28:46.060
Weapons? Armed, loaded, ready to fire.

28:46.084 --> 28:47.755
Why don't we hear 'em?
Have they dead stopped?

28:47.780 --> 28:49.318
Let's go active sonar.

28:49.342 --> 28:52.145
- He'll hear us.
- What choice do we have?

28:52.285 --> 28:55.887
If you ask me, they could
be bloody hearing us now.

28:56.935 --> 28:59.807
How fast can you target once we go active?

28:59.832 --> 29:03.211
Less than one minute, sir.
You have my word on that.

29:07.102 --> 29:08.970
Go active sonar.

29:10.307 --> 29:11.975
Going active.

29:12.008 --> 29:13.541
[Submarine clanks]

29:15.082 --> 29:18.084
- Sir, they've gone active. We're getting pinged.
- [Siren blaring]

29:18.109 --> 29:19.105
They're turning at us.

29:19.969 --> 29:22.136
Bridge, all ahead, flank 3. Evasive action.

29:22.165 --> 29:23.470
Engage prairie masker air.

29:23.495 --> 29:25.126
T.A.O., three fish in the water now!

29:25.151 --> 29:27.407
Clear to starboard! Sonar,
calculating firing solution.

29:27.432 --> 29:28.976
Fire torpedoes down established bearings!

29:29.001 --> 29:30.657
- Solve for second salvo.
- Yes, sir!

29:30.682 --> 29:33.950
[Alarm beeping]

29:37.905 --> 29:40.582
[Torpedo whooshes]

29:44.555 --> 29:45.788
What was that?

29:45.984 --> 29:48.452
That was our torpedos.

29:48.477 --> 29:50.260
Second salvo, give 'em another three.

29:50.285 --> 29:51.784
Sonar, what's incoming?

29:51.809 --> 29:53.476
He's at full speed now, sir,
headed straight for us...

29:53.501 --> 29:56.260
He's fired, sir! Just fired two!

29:57.657 --> 30:00.673
Now three! Now four, sir!
He's fired four! Four incoming!

30:00.698 --> 30:02.264
Bridge, torpedoes inbound!

30:02.289 --> 30:06.661
Circle back over our wake
and point the ship 2-2-5!

30:10.445 --> 30:14.502
[Torpedoes whoosh]

30:16.872 --> 30:21.208
Active return, bearing 2-7-5!
We've got incoming torpedoes!

30:21.297 --> 30:24.702
Fire again, sir? I have a
point of origin. We can get 'em.

30:24.727 --> 30:27.327
- Hell, no! Dive!
- All hands, crash dive!

30:27.352 --> 30:29.619
- Turn it all off!
- Ian: Make fast gear and crew!

30:29.644 --> 30:31.702
Helm, 35 degrees hard starboard!

30:31.727 --> 30:33.405
- [Alarm blaring]
- Dive, dive, dive!

30:33.430 --> 30:36.105
It's too shallow here,
sir! We'll hit bottom!

30:39.718 --> 30:44.429
[Alarm continues blaring]

30:48.581 --> 30:50.882
[Whooshing]

30:50.907 --> 30:54.008
Incoming torpedoes range 500 yards!

30:54.756 --> 30:57.828
400 yards! All hands, brace for impact!

30:57.853 --> 31:00.229
[Radio chatter]

31:02.678 --> 31:04.872
300! Bridge, you see the trails.

31:04.897 --> 31:06.697
Call it if they're gonna hit!

31:06.699 --> 31:08.065
200 yards!

31:08.067 --> 31:10.729
[Torpedo whooshing]

31:17.835 --> 31:19.502
We're clear!

31:19.527 --> 31:22.124
Man: That's the last fish. Last
fish clear, last fish clear.

31:24.804 --> 31:27.473
[Radio chatter]

31:27.498 --> 31:29.364
Mason: Sir?

31:29.389 --> 31:31.733
He's stopping pinging. He's gone silent.

31:31.758 --> 31:32.624
Did we hit him?

31:32.649 --> 31:34.649
I don't know, sir. He's...

31:35.777 --> 31:37.778
He's just gone.

31:38.531 --> 31:42.499
Stand by for my confirmation.
No, no, there's still silence.

31:46.793 --> 31:49.477
Chandler: Did any of them
sound like hits to you?

31:49.502 --> 31:51.875
I can't be sure, sir.

31:52.115 --> 31:54.875
If I'd heard any secondaries,
I'd know, but this...

31:54.941 --> 31:57.141
It's just not enough information.

31:57.393 --> 31:58.826
- I'm sorry, sir.
- Hey.

31:58.867 --> 32:01.368
We're still here.

32:02.646 --> 32:05.066
You did your job.

32:06.219 --> 32:10.701
But if we didn't hit it, where did it go?

32:18.282 --> 32:21.807
[Rattling]

32:24.301 --> 32:25.969
[Rumbling]

32:26.237 --> 32:28.003
What the hell is that?

32:28.028 --> 32:31.117
We're scraping the canyon walls.

32:31.212 --> 32:33.715
[Rattle]

32:36.237 --> 32:37.904
[Scraping continues]

32:37.929 --> 32:39.647
Bloody hell.

32:39.672 --> 32:42.368
My God, the hull's gonna buckle!

32:50.234 --> 32:53.603
Nerve, men. Show some nerve.

32:53.628 --> 32:56.796
[Rattling continues]

32:56.821 --> 32:59.122
Courageous make their own luck.

32:59.758 --> 33:03.786
Never forget, we're the selected.

33:08.041 --> 33:11.482
[Squishing]

33:11.794 --> 33:13.462
I'm not exactly sure

33:13.487 --> 33:16.486
this is precisely what
you were looking for.

33:17.453 --> 33:21.389
It's a... Flash drive.

33:22.399 --> 33:24.000
Not a beacon.

33:26.942 --> 33:29.182
Bring up V.M.S. on the monitor.

33:29.207 --> 33:30.973
[Radio chatter]

33:31.103 --> 33:34.393
Okay, there's a very
narrow canyon here, sir.

33:34.418 --> 33:35.749
It's big enough for a sub

33:35.774 --> 33:37.641
that could do an emergency dive there?

33:37.861 --> 33:40.196
Into that? Blind at 20 knots?

33:40.221 --> 33:42.627
He's not a Royal Navy
captain. He's a wild card.

33:42.692 --> 33:44.992
Unless he knows how to helm a sub,

33:45.017 --> 33:47.684
he'll crack up along that canyon wall.

33:47.803 --> 33:49.503
[Door opens]

33:49.900 --> 33:52.062
It wasn't a beacon.

33:52.087 --> 33:54.354
[Panting]

33:54.379 --> 33:56.879
[Flash drive clicks]

33:56.904 --> 34:00.307
- [Beep]
- Sir, these files are completely corrupted.

34:00.332 --> 34:02.332
It's been inside him for 12 hours.

34:02.357 --> 34:04.090
Can you retrieve the data?

34:04.115 --> 34:07.221
We'll try to interpolate,
sir. It's gonna take some time.

34:19.960 --> 34:22.471
Dr. Hunter.

34:22.804 --> 34:24.938
Dr. Hunter. Of course.

34:25.498 --> 34:27.705
Where do you think you're going?

34:27.842 --> 34:31.424
I have something that
your captain needs to see.

34:31.581 --> 34:34.824
Take me to the bridge now!

34:37.683 --> 34:39.862
I found it.

34:40.692 --> 34:42.958
Dr. Hunter. Her mentor.

34:42.984 --> 34:44.205
I know where he is.

34:44.230 --> 34:46.097
He'll know the locations.

34:56.764 --> 34:58.297
His blood pressure's dropping.

34:58.322 --> 35:01.661
We need to get him to the medical bay now.

35:06.431 --> 35:09.925
Classified burst transmission from the CDC.

35:10.779 --> 35:12.412
So he got it from <i>Solace.</i>

35:12.437 --> 35:14.404
I've got geographical coordinates.

35:14.406 --> 35:16.439
They'll be decrypted in a moment, sir.

35:17.608 --> 35:20.585
Alisha: 40-45-38

35:20.610 --> 35:23.677
and 111-53-27.

35:23.702 --> 35:25.269
That's Salt Lake City, sir.

35:25.294 --> 35:27.572
- Decrypting the next location.
- [Beeping]

35:27.597 --> 35:29.263
Slattery: Phoenix.

35:29.288 --> 35:31.221
It's the labs.

35:32.729 --> 35:34.329
It's <i>all</i> the labs.

35:34.354 --> 35:36.654
He didn't wanna be up on
deck to transmit our location.

35:36.679 --> 35:39.835
He wanted to be up there
so he could swim to the sub

35:39.860 --> 35:41.126
once they'd sunk us.

35:41.151 --> 35:43.135
He wanted to deliver that thing to them.

35:43.468 --> 35:46.036
They want the cure, all right,
but they want <i>all</i> the cure

35:46.038 --> 35:47.404
so they can control it.

35:47.406 --> 35:49.072
Chandler: That's why they
went to <i>Solace,</i>

35:49.074 --> 35:50.907
to find the location of the other labs.

35:50.909 --> 35:53.147
How are they gonna get to
the inland ones from a sub?

35:53.172 --> 35:54.771
Sir, I got something on radar.

35:54.796 --> 35:56.572
What is it?

35:56.597 --> 36:00.172
- [Beeping rapidly]
- T.A.O., ballistic missile fire detected.

36:00.197 --> 36:02.030
Missiles.

36:02.145 --> 36:04.212
Climbing, just came over the horizon.

36:04.237 --> 36:06.433
- Inbound?
- No, sir. They're diverging.

36:06.465 --> 36:09.249
Already pretty spread out.

36:11.215 --> 36:13.083
How many? I've got 16.

36:13.108 --> 36:14.808
Now 17, 18.

36:14.810 --> 36:16.896
- Gotta be coming from the sub.
- Those missiles are headed

36:16.921 --> 36:18.405
toward the same coordinates
I just pulled up.

36:18.430 --> 36:20.334
- They're bombing the labs.
- Son of a bitch.

36:20.359 --> 36:22.839
- T.A.O., calculate a target to intercept.
- Calculating, sir.

36:22.841 --> 36:25.793
Fire SM-3s to intercept. Where
is that sub? Is it in range?

36:25.818 --> 36:27.543
- It's too far, sir.
- Damn it.

36:27.568 --> 36:30.154
Batteries release on
every target you got now!

36:30.179 --> 36:32.238
Yes, sir. Batteries release on all tracks.

36:32.263 --> 36:35.676
Birds away, track 2-5-7-1,
2-5-7-2, 2-5-7-3.

36:35.701 --> 36:37.279
Slattery: Granderson, we
gotta get a message to the lab.

36:37.304 --> 36:38.575
We gotta get those people out of there.

36:38.600 --> 36:44.737
[Missiles whooshing]

36:47.704 --> 36:49.372
Get out now.

36:49.397 --> 36:51.558
The lab you are will be under
missile attack within minutes.

36:51.583 --> 36:53.339
If you are hearing the sound of my voice

36:53.364 --> 36:55.925
and are located in any of
the labs listed on the CDC...

36:55.950 --> 36:58.889
If you are hearing me, get away
from the entire complex now!

36:58.914 --> 37:00.680
All staff, I want all staff 2 miles

37:00.705 --> 37:02.005
from your building immediately.

37:02.030 --> 37:04.196
All missiles now out of range, sir.

37:04.221 --> 37:05.887
How many we get?

37:05.912 --> 37:08.095
I have confirmation on...

37:09.552 --> 37:12.720
Two were in range, sir. We got them both.

37:12.839 --> 37:14.395
Out of how many?

37:14.420 --> 37:16.496
We logged 26.

37:18.028 --> 37:22.496
Virtually all of them were
out of range before we fired.

37:31.257 --> 37:34.553
I had him for a few
moments, but he slipped back.

37:34.578 --> 37:37.446
I tried everything I could.

37:39.541 --> 37:41.975
Why would they want to
destroy all the labs?

37:42.000 --> 37:43.917
It doesn't make any sense.

37:43.942 --> 37:46.276
[Takes off gloves]

37:46.301 --> 37:48.668
Unless already have the vaccine.

37:48.788 --> 37:51.288
Maybe that's how they "conquered" Europe.

37:51.313 --> 37:52.617
Is that possible?

37:52.642 --> 37:55.617
I don't see how anyone could
have the primordial besides me.

37:55.943 --> 37:57.743
Europe was decimated.

37:57.768 --> 38:00.450
It was one of the hottest
zones thanks to Niels.

38:01.285 --> 38:03.453
But yes.

38:03.823 --> 38:06.166
I suppose it's possible.

38:06.769 --> 38:08.702
Slattery: He never asked for the cure.

38:08.727 --> 38:10.768
I figured it was 'cause he knew

38:10.793 --> 38:12.767
he was never getting off the ship.

38:13.958 --> 38:17.567
Maybe he'd already gotten
it. Maybe they all had.

38:18.231 --> 38:20.131
He kept saying,

38:20.156 --> 38:23.267
"everyone on my ship is like me."

38:32.087 --> 38:35.329
<i>The seals think it was a
Tomahawk missile or a bomb.</i>

38:35.354 --> 38:36.720
<i>We didn't see it, but we heard it.</i>

38:36.722 --> 38:38.221
<i>It was really, really loud, dad.</i>

38:38.223 --> 38:40.036
<i>Grandpa said it was
just over the horizon.</i>

38:40.061 --> 38:41.536
<i>Yeah. Who's doing this, daddy?</i>

38:41.561 --> 38:44.235
There are people who want to stop us.

38:44.423 --> 38:46.636
I know that's hard to believe,

38:46.661 --> 38:50.235
but looks like I'm gonna be gone
a lot longer than we thought.

38:50.260 --> 38:53.317
<i>Do you think that we
need to move away?</i>

38:53.342 --> 38:55.976
<i>Kelly thought that maybe
it was a good idea.</i>

38:56.352 --> 38:58.485
<i>Yes, hi.</i>

38:58.510 --> 39:00.735
<i>Do you think we need
to move further inland?</i>

39:00.869 --> 39:02.768
As far as we can tell, you're safe there.

39:02.793 --> 39:05.661
These people wanted the labs. That's...

39:05.686 --> 39:07.819
Looks like it's all they wanted.

39:07.844 --> 39:08.843
<i>Why?</i>

39:08.868 --> 39:10.335
We don't know.

39:10.389 --> 39:12.756
<i>Tommy, we're okay.</i>

39:12.758 --> 39:14.991
<i>Kelly: Come with me, kids.</i>

39:15.016 --> 39:16.404
<i>Yeah.</i>

39:17.396 --> 39:19.982
<i>If there's any more action close by,</i>

39:20.007 --> 39:22.908
<i>I'll make the call to evacuate.</i>

39:22.933 --> 39:24.833
<i>And we'll keep you informed.</i>

39:24.858 --> 39:25.982
Thanks, dad.

39:26.007 --> 39:30.009
<i>Tom... You gotta take
these people out.</i>

39:30.135 --> 39:31.434
I know it.

39:31.545 --> 39:35.282
<i>Well, then... Get back to it.</i>

39:35.486 --> 39:37.353
<i>We got it covered here.</i>

39:37.378 --> 39:38.744
Yes, sir.

39:38.769 --> 39:40.102
[Knock on door]

39:40.331 --> 39:42.397
- [Taps key]
- Come on in.

39:49.296 --> 39:52.681
No response yet on the
roll call for the labs.

39:53.356 --> 39:55.189
It's possible they lost their comms, but...

39:55.214 --> 39:58.889
I know. I know why they bombed the labs.

39:58.914 --> 40:01.519
And why they're trying
to destroy <i>Solace.</i>

40:01.664 --> 40:04.228
It's not, in fact, because
they were vaccinated.

40:04.253 --> 40:06.086
Quite the opposite.

40:07.565 --> 40:10.300
I just tested Juan Carlos's blood.

40:10.977 --> 40:14.087
It turns out that he's naturally immune.

40:16.210 --> 40:19.261
None of the mercs on
<i>Solace</i> were C.B.R.

40:20.015 --> 40:22.183
Is it possible they're all immune?

40:22.208 --> 40:23.641
Everyone's like him?

40:23.666 --> 40:26.565
I cross-referenced his
blood against Bertrise's.

40:26.860 --> 40:29.213
Natural immunity,

40:29.344 --> 40:31.344
as it turns out,

40:31.369 --> 40:33.991
is a tad more common
than I initially thought.

40:34.016 --> 40:39.057
Anywhere between 1% and 5%
of the global population.

40:40.217 --> 40:43.857
That's how they took Europe.

40:45.478 --> 40:49.647
Now their mission is to destroy
the cure wherever it exists,

40:49.711 --> 40:52.252
on a nuclear-powered sub

40:53.047 --> 40:56.670
that <i>never</i> runs out of fuel.

40:56.695 --> 40:59.756
Yes, but we had the flash drive.

40:59.975 --> 41:03.357
How the hell did they
know where those labs were?

41:03.382 --> 41:07.256
You are all so fortunate
now that I'm here, yeah?

41:07.360 --> 41:09.956
Don't you agree?

41:09.981 --> 41:12.081
Admit it.

41:12.431 --> 41:14.456
You listen to me,

41:14.481 --> 41:17.756
and you have victories
too plentiful to count.

41:17.781 --> 41:19.557
Yeah?

41:21.346 --> 41:22.857
Now the <i>James.</i>

41:22.882 --> 41:24.956
No, Bruv.

41:27.567 --> 41:31.256
Now we take America.
