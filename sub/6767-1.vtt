WEBVTT

00:02.382 --> 00:03.679
That's a good idea.

00:06.086 --> 00:08.145
Well, that's it.

00:08.188 --> 00:10.918
Three more shots, and
we're done for the night.

00:10.957 --> 00:12.151
l'm so beat.

00:12.192 --> 00:13.989
l can't believe
we're two hours over.

00:14.027 --> 00:15.255
He's creaming us.

00:15.329 --> 00:16.557
Hmm. come here.

00:16.596 --> 00:18.188
Let me give you a hug.

00:18.231 --> 00:19.562
oh.

00:19.599 --> 00:21.362
How's that?

00:21.401 --> 00:22.993
Hmm. Great.

00:23.036 --> 00:25.027
Really great?

00:26.506 --> 00:27.871
Ecstasy.

00:27.908 --> 00:31.867
oh! oh, David,
we had such a great summer.

00:31.912 --> 00:33.106
Yeah, me, too.

00:33.146 --> 00:35.137
Mmm.

00:36.316 --> 00:37.806
Ah! All right.

00:37.851 --> 00:39.216
-oh.
-Don't go soft on me.

00:39.252 --> 00:41.277
We still have a
lot of work to do.

00:41.355 --> 00:42.549
l know.

00:42.589 --> 00:44.079
David, do you copy?

00:44.124 --> 00:46.024
Yeah, this is David.
We, uh, ready to roll?

00:46.059 --> 00:48.823
Uh, l think we have a problem.

00:48.862 --> 00:51.194
Taz says
his band is done for the night.

00:51.231 --> 00:52.596
They're leaving for

00:52.632 --> 00:53.929
their dressing rooms
as we speak.

00:53.967 --> 00:55.628
Damn it.

00:55.669 --> 00:57.466
Do you want to talk to him?

00:58.772 --> 01:01.002
No. No.
That'll just make him mad.

01:01.041 --> 01:02.235
Just-Just make sure...

01:03.677 --> 01:06.737
Make sure he's got the call time
for tomorrow.

01:06.780 --> 01:08.372
Will do.

01:09.816 --> 01:12.751
Well, that's it.
This guy is killing us.

01:12.786 --> 01:14.481
lt's not that bad.
We'll pick it up tomorrow.

01:14.521 --> 01:16.421
What kind of stupid answer
is that?

01:16.456 --> 01:17.616
come on, Donna.

01:17.657 --> 01:18.988
We've been putting this
together all summer,

01:19.025 --> 01:20.151
and we're over budget.

01:20.193 --> 01:21.353
We have to cut the scene.

01:21.395 --> 01:22.521
David, don't call me stupid.

01:22.562 --> 01:24.257
And if you had felt
that strongly about it,

01:24.297 --> 01:25.594
you should have talked Taz
into staying.

01:25.632 --> 01:29.693
Donna, he's the biggest artist
at MZA, all right?

01:29.736 --> 01:32.569
lf we blow this with him,
our career is through.

01:32.606 --> 01:34.471
-That's not true.
-Yes, it is.

01:34.508 --> 01:35.941
That's how it works
around here, all right?

01:35.976 --> 01:37.568
one bad video,
and you're out of the business

01:37.611 --> 01:38.873
as fast as you got into it.

01:38.912 --> 01:42.473
Well, at least
we've still got each other.

01:42.516 --> 01:44.416
Donna, focus, all right?

01:44.451 --> 01:46.282
Please?

01:46.319 --> 01:48.879
come on. We have a lot
of work to do.

01:48.922 --> 01:50.116
That's a wrap, everybody.

01:52.000 --> 01:58.074
Advertise your product or brand here

02:59.426 --> 03:01.587

03:01.628 --> 03:02.822
Thank you, Professor Doyle.

03:02.863 --> 03:06.162
Yes, l have decided
where l want to volunteer.

03:06.199 --> 03:07.894
Hi.

03:07.934 --> 03:10.232
l-l look forward to
talking to you about it.

03:10.303 --> 03:11.531
-okay, great.
-Thank you.

03:11.571 --> 03:12.833
Sounds good.

03:12.873 --> 03:14.135
See you then. Bye.

03:14.174 --> 03:15.505
-Hi!
-Hi. l'm home.

03:15.542 --> 03:16.668
Welcome home.

03:16.710 --> 03:18.234
-You look great.
-oh, thank you.

03:18.311 --> 03:20.006
l was just on my way out.

03:20.046 --> 03:21.946
l thought l was
going to miss you.

03:21.982 --> 03:23.882
oh, l know.
l got right through customs.

03:23.917 --> 03:26.078
Well, it's good to be home.

03:26.119 --> 03:28.917
Hmm. lt's been
kind of quiet here.

03:28.955 --> 03:29.922
Donna's been so busy,

03:29.956 --> 03:31.116
she's never around.

03:31.157 --> 03:32.784
lt'll be good to have the place
back to normal.

03:32.826 --> 03:34.726
Don't even talk
to me about normal.

03:34.761 --> 03:37.355
l am so jetlagged,
l'm probably not gonna sleep now

03:37.397 --> 03:38.864
for, like, three days.

03:38.899 --> 03:41.561
l was just headed off to school,
but then l'm going to the salon.

03:41.601 --> 03:42.727
Do you want to meet me?

03:42.769 --> 03:44.600
Yeah, sure.

03:44.638 --> 03:47.072
oh, um,
have you talked to Steve?

03:47.107 --> 03:49.371
Yes. l talked
to him and to Brandon,

03:49.409 --> 03:51.274
and they are making good time.

03:51.344 --> 03:53.471
They said
that they'll be staying

03:53.513 --> 03:55.606
at the Alamo Regency Hotel
in San Antonio

03:55.649 --> 03:57.742
tomorrow.
He left you the number.

03:57.784 --> 03:59.183
He said
he can't wait to see you.

03:59.219 --> 04:01.210
-Really?
-He's so cute.

04:01.254 --> 04:02.619
He said that three weeks

04:02.656 --> 04:04.817
without you was like cruel
and unusual punishment.

04:04.858 --> 04:07.383
You know, it's so weird.

04:07.427 --> 04:11.056
l didn't think l was gonna
miss him so much, but l did.

04:11.097 --> 04:12.428
Well, be prepared.

04:12.465 --> 04:14.490
He said that he'd be
banging down your bedroom door

04:14.534 --> 04:16.331
by Friday if he had
to drive all night

04:16.369 --> 04:17.563
and all day to get there.

04:17.603 --> 04:20.038
See ya.

04:20.072 --> 04:22.098
Bye.

04:46.132 --> 04:49.101
So, you boys were in Atlanta
for the olympics, huh?

04:49.135 --> 04:50.261
Yup.

04:50.303 --> 04:51.429
USA all the way.

04:51.471 --> 04:52.597
l love Atlanta.

04:52.639 --> 04:54.436
That's the greatest city
in the South.

04:54.474 --> 04:55.600
Yes siree.

04:55.642 --> 04:57.701
Hey, Lee, how long
you think it'll be

04:57.744 --> 04:59.609
before you can get
this water pump?

04:59.646 --> 05:01.170
Well, you two are in luck.

05:01.214 --> 05:03.011
Besides my garage,
l got a junkyard

05:03.049 --> 05:04.573
on the other side of town.

05:04.618 --> 05:06.745
oh, lots of Mustang parts.

05:06.786 --> 05:08.219
My boy-- he loves Mustangs.

05:08.288 --> 05:09.949
Whereabouts

05:09.990 --> 05:11.514
in california y'all from anyway?

05:11.558 --> 05:12.752
Beverly Hills.

05:12.792 --> 05:13.986
ooh!

05:14.027 --> 05:16.427
Swimming pools,
movie stars, huh?

05:29.075 --> 05:33.978
Well, it ain't Beverly Hills,
but we call it home.

05:34.014 --> 05:35.413
Lamar,

05:35.448 --> 05:37.712
l need you
to get over to the yard,

05:37.751 --> 05:39.946
pick up a water pump
off of that wrecked 'Stang

05:39.986 --> 05:41.578
we pulled in last month.

05:41.621 --> 05:43.919
Daddy, l told
Fred l'd help him.

05:43.957 --> 05:47.017
Yeah, well, l told these boys

05:47.060 --> 05:49.255
l'd have them on their way
this afternoon. Now get.

05:49.329 --> 05:51.763
come on, Fred.

05:57.937 --> 05:59.905
You guys from california,

05:59.939 --> 06:01.372
-huh?
-Yeah.

06:01.408 --> 06:03.433
Land of the fruits and the nuts.

06:04.944 --> 06:06.969
So tell me--
which one are you guys?

06:07.013 --> 06:08.844
oh, l'm sorry.
l didn't hear that question.

06:08.882 --> 06:10.440
He had his tongue in my ear.

06:16.089 --> 06:17.716
Don't mind Lamar.

06:17.757 --> 06:19.520
You guys go, uh,
have yourself a bite.

06:19.559 --> 06:21.754
l'll have you on your
way before you know it.

06:21.795 --> 06:23.820
Thanks, Lee.

06:27.367 --> 06:29.426
l can't believe this
happened to your car.

06:29.469 --> 06:31.232
clare thinks l'm
gonna be home Friday.

06:31.304 --> 06:32.566
So it will be Saturday.

06:32.605 --> 06:33.731
What's the big deal?

06:33.773 --> 06:35.035
l want to see her.

06:35.075 --> 06:36.337
l need to see her!

06:36.376 --> 06:38.810
Look, Steve, if you want
to blow off the Alamo,

06:38.845 --> 06:40.244
l'll drive you up to Houston,

06:40.313 --> 06:41.974
you can catch a plane
from there.

06:42.015 --> 06:43.448
You want to see the Alamo.

06:43.483 --> 06:44.916
l can't do that to you.

06:44.951 --> 06:47.818
You know, l've been on the road
by myself all summer.

06:47.854 --> 06:49.549
lf l want to see the Alamo,

06:49.589 --> 06:51.580
believe me,
l'm gonna see the Alamo.

06:51.624 --> 06:53.455
Huh.

06:53.493 --> 06:54.619
That's a bus to Houston.

06:54.661 --> 06:55.787
lt's a sign from God.

06:55.829 --> 06:57.421
-You got to get on it.
-Hmm.

06:59.299 --> 07:00.425
Yeah?

07:00.467 --> 07:02.560
You think l want
to listen to you complain

07:02.602 --> 07:04.934
and watch you limp around
for the next two days?

07:04.971 --> 07:07.064
Why don't you just
get out of here?

07:07.107 --> 07:09.439
okay, listen, if you call
home, don't tell anybody.

07:09.476 --> 07:11.341
l want to surprise clare.

07:11.377 --> 07:12.639
l'm sure you will.

07:12.679 --> 07:13.941
But be gentle, big boy.

07:13.980 --> 07:15.106
She's a small girl.

07:15.148 --> 07:17.878
Like a man possessed!

07:21.755 --> 07:24.189
Hello.

07:24.224 --> 07:25.521
Hey, Val. How's it going?

07:25.558 --> 07:27.492
lt's going. Where are you?

07:27.527 --> 07:29.051
Not exactly where l want to be.

07:29.095 --> 07:30.221
My car broke down.

07:30.263 --> 07:31.855
oh, l'm sorry to hear that.

07:31.898 --> 07:33.024
Hey, it's no biggie.

07:33.066 --> 07:34.226
lt's all an adventure, right?

07:34.267 --> 07:36.827
Sounds like
you're having a good time.

07:36.870 --> 07:38.132
oh, yeah.

07:38.171 --> 07:39.536
The road is my life.

07:39.572 --> 07:42.006
So, Val, uh, you taking care

07:42.041 --> 07:43.838
of paying the bills
and everything?

07:43.877 --> 07:45.606
Yes, l've been on top of it.

07:45.645 --> 07:47.636
Paying bills is the highlight
of my month.

07:47.680 --> 07:49.910
When are you guys coming home?
l miss you.

07:49.949 --> 07:52.144
l should be home
after the weekend.

07:52.185 --> 07:53.812
So, how's the club doing?

07:53.853 --> 07:55.753
More of the same. Lousy.

07:55.789 --> 07:57.188
Did you do what my Dad said

07:57.223 --> 07:58.781
and talk to someone
about getting some help?

07:58.825 --> 08:01.123
Yes. He set me up
with a cPA in his LA office.

08:01.161 --> 08:02.492
l'm supposed
to meet with him today.

08:02.529 --> 08:03.860
Great. Great.

08:03.897 --> 08:06.832
So, um,
everything's under control?

08:06.866 --> 08:07.992
Yes, sir.

08:08.034 --> 08:09.160
Everything is under control,
sir.

08:09.202 --> 08:11.193
Very funny.

08:11.271 --> 08:12.533
Just hurry home.

08:12.572 --> 08:14.005
lt's been lonely here.

08:14.040 --> 08:15.473
All right, l'm on my way to you.

08:15.508 --> 08:16.634
l'll see you soon.

08:16.676 --> 08:18.644
Bye.

08:28.288 --> 08:31.121
Why is everybody having fun
this summer except for me?

09:06.159 --> 09:08.127
Excuse me.

09:08.161 --> 09:10.152
Um, l'm looking for some
information on the Alamo.

09:10.196 --> 09:11.993
could you point me
in the right direction?

09:12.031 --> 09:14.829
Yes, most of our standard stuff
is in our Texas History section.

09:14.868 --> 09:17.302
But now, if you're a
Texaphile, we've got

09:17.337 --> 09:19.202
some interesting historical
documents in the back.

09:19.272 --> 09:21.297
Well, l wouldn't mind
a little of both.

09:21.341 --> 09:23.138
okay. l'll see what l can do.

09:23.176 --> 09:24.473
-Thanks.
-All right.

09:33.353 --> 09:35.913
So, how was your summer, clare?

09:35.955 --> 09:37.923
Well, after Steve went to the
olympics, l went to Switzerland

09:37.957 --> 09:39.720
to see these friends
that l went to school with.

09:39.759 --> 09:41.021
lt was so weird.

09:41.060 --> 09:42.322
They're all, like, married now.

09:42.362 --> 09:43.989
Well, supposedly,

09:44.030 --> 09:46.362
European women mature faster
than us.

09:46.399 --> 09:48.390
Well, if that's maturity,
they can have it.

09:48.434 --> 09:49.332
oh, how was summer school?

09:49.369 --> 09:50.768
lt was good.

09:50.803 --> 09:52.236
l still have to do an internship

09:52.305 --> 09:54.136
at a care facility
to finish up one course.

09:54.173 --> 09:56.004
Hmm. charming.

09:56.042 --> 09:57.407
Well, my suggestion?

09:57.443 --> 09:59.206
Find a place by the beach.

09:59.245 --> 10:00.610
Well, l'd like
to make it worthwhile

10:00.647 --> 10:02.581
if l'm going
to put in the time, you know?

10:02.615 --> 10:03.809
Yeah.

10:03.850 --> 10:05.044
Hold that thought.

10:05.084 --> 10:06.244
Hi, Val.

10:06.352 --> 10:08.081
Hi, clare.
Welcome back.

10:08.121 --> 10:09.247
Thank you.

10:09.289 --> 10:10.586
Hi, Kel.

10:10.623 --> 10:11.885
Hello, Valerie.

10:11.925 --> 10:13.051
How are you?

10:13.092 --> 10:14.719
Do you really want to know?

10:14.761 --> 10:16.023
l've been around all summer,

10:16.062 --> 10:17.859
and you haven't bothered
to inquire before.

10:17.897 --> 10:20.365
Just being polite. Sorry.

10:20.400 --> 10:23.563
So, how was your summer?

10:23.603 --> 10:25.537
-Uneventful.
-oh.

10:25.571 --> 10:27.471
What happened
to that, uh, cute FBl guy?

10:27.507 --> 10:29.270
He got reassigned to Miami.

10:29.342 --> 10:30.934
lt made the relationship
too difficult.

10:31.844 --> 10:33.971
oh. Poor Valerie. Alone again.

10:34.013 --> 10:35.981
Don't worry, Kel.

10:36.015 --> 10:38.575
l was thinking
l'd just wait for your new guy

10:38.618 --> 10:39.880
and go after him.

10:41.654 --> 10:43.121
Well, you should have, uh, fun

10:43.156 --> 10:44.885
at David and Donna's
wrap party tonight.

10:44.924 --> 10:46.289
Why? Aren't you going?

10:46.359 --> 10:50.386
No, l'm leaving straight
from here to go to San Antonio.

10:50.430 --> 10:52.625
Surprise attack
on Steve at the Alamo.

11:01.274 --> 11:02.400
Ta-da!

11:02.442 --> 11:04.740
l thought you might like
to see these as well.

11:04.777 --> 11:08.008
These are original orders signed
by colonel James Bowie.

11:08.047 --> 11:10.811
-oh, he of the famous knife,
cool. -Yeah.

11:10.850 --> 11:13.876
-So are you planning on visiting
the garrison? -Yeah.

11:13.920 --> 11:15.751
Yeah, l am actually, l...

11:17.390 --> 11:20.689
lt's, uh, it's always
fascinated me.

11:20.727 --> 11:24.254
okay, well, l've done my share
of research on it, so...

11:24.330 --> 11:25.729
-You have?
-Yeah.

11:25.765 --> 11:26.993
Did you discover anything new?

11:27.033 --> 11:30.366
Well... l did find

11:30.403 --> 11:33.531
that before the final battle,
General Santa Anna

11:33.573 --> 11:35.803
called on three angels to give
him and his men courage.

11:35.842 --> 11:37.275
-Must have worked.
-Mm-hmm.

11:37.343 --> 11:38.401
Any particular angels?

11:38.444 --> 11:41.538
Uriel, Raphael, and Michael.

11:41.581 --> 11:43.640
Are you sure those aren't
the Ninja Turtles?

11:43.683 --> 11:45.617
Positive.

11:45.651 --> 11:47.619
Angels are my specialty.

11:47.653 --> 11:50.087
-Really?
-Mm-hmm.

11:50.123 --> 11:52.182
-Have you ever met one?
-No.

11:52.225 --> 11:53.715
No, not personally.

11:53.760 --> 11:57.287
But the theme of angels
is so prevalent in, like,

11:57.397 --> 11:59.297
the art and lore
of almost every culture,

11:59.399 --> 12:00.627
so l presume they exist.

12:00.666 --> 12:03.464
The only angels l know
are the california Angels.

12:03.503 --> 12:05.971
l'm afraid there's no pennant
in their future though.

12:06.005 --> 12:08.200
Are you from L.A.?

12:08.241 --> 12:09.765
-Yeah.
-oh.

12:09.809 --> 12:11.538
-Yeah.
-oh, okay.

12:11.577 --> 12:13.704
Actually l was on my way back
there when my car broke down.

12:13.746 --> 12:15.737
lt's being fixed
at a garage down the street.

12:15.782 --> 12:17.249
-Uh-huh.
-Mariah.

12:17.283 --> 12:20.480
l believe you're supposed to be
cataloguing new acquisitions.

12:20.520 --> 12:23.250
Yes, l know, but, uh,
the gentleman had questions.

12:23.356 --> 12:26.348
-That's not why you're here.
-Excuse me.

12:26.392 --> 12:28.826
But that is part
of my responsibilities.

12:28.861 --> 12:30.089
l was being helpful.

12:30.129 --> 12:31.255
She was.

12:31.330 --> 12:35.266
You have an attitude problem,
young woman.

12:35.368 --> 12:37.802
l expect an apology right now.

12:37.837 --> 12:39.464
Well, you're not going
to get one.

12:39.505 --> 12:40.597
l'm doing my job.

12:40.640 --> 12:42.733
l warn you.
You are on thin ice.

12:43.743 --> 12:45.210
Really?

12:45.244 --> 12:46.438
Well, then l'm turning
in my skates.

12:47.513 --> 12:48.707
l quit.

12:48.748 --> 12:51.182
Wait a minute,
she didn't mean that.

12:51.217 --> 12:53.310
-Tell her you didn't mean that.
-l meant every word of it.

13:05.164 --> 13:06.392
l can't believe you did that.

13:06.432 --> 13:08.332
-l feel terrible.
-No, trust me.

13:08.367 --> 13:09.766
lt had nothing to do with you.

13:09.802 --> 13:12.168
lt's been a long time coming.

13:12.205 --> 13:14.435
At least-- at least
let me buy you lunch, huh?

13:14.474 --> 13:16.908
lt will make me feel better.

13:16.943 --> 13:19.935
Um, look, l, l usually don't

13:19.979 --> 13:21.640
accept invitations
from strangers.

13:21.681 --> 13:23.080
okay, okay, l understand that.

13:23.116 --> 13:25.949
Um, my name's Brandon Walsh.

13:27.920 --> 13:29.217
Mariah Murphy.

13:29.255 --> 13:31.485
Ah, see? See, now we're not
strangers any more.

13:31.524 --> 13:34.015
-old friends from the library.
-Mm-hmm.

13:37.130 --> 13:38.392
come on.

13:38.431 --> 13:40.058
l'll take you
to my favorite place.

13:40.099 --> 13:41.532
Great.

13:50.309 --> 13:51.640
Salt and Pepper.

13:52.812 --> 13:54.973
Don't that make you sick?

14:01.954 --> 14:04.650
-Hello? come on in.
-Hi.

14:04.690 --> 14:06.681
Take a seat.

14:09.328 --> 14:10.795
Well, Jim Walsh
told me about you.

14:10.830 --> 14:12.991
of course, he
neglected to mention

14:13.032 --> 14:15.125
you were so young,
so attractive.

14:15.168 --> 14:17.102
Well, thank you,
Mr. Bannerman.

14:17.136 --> 14:20.037
l was just on a conference call
with him.

14:20.072 --> 14:23.132
He's doing some wonderful work
for the firm in the Pacific Rim.

14:23.176 --> 14:25.440
So, uh--

14:25.478 --> 14:27.708
you know, l'd prefer if we were
on first name basis.

14:27.747 --> 14:28.736
lf that's okay with you,
Valerie?

14:28.781 --> 14:31.249
-Sure, Ken.
-Kenny.

14:31.317 --> 14:32.750
l prefer Kenny.

14:32.785 --> 14:34.912
Ken was
Barbie's boyfriend, right?

14:34.954 --> 14:36.945
Right.

14:36.989 --> 14:39.253
Well, Jim speaks
very highly of you.

14:39.325 --> 14:40.622
Well, l'm flattered.

14:40.660 --> 14:43.094
Truth is, he really showed me
the ropes around here.

14:43.129 --> 14:44.255
l owe him.

14:44.330 --> 14:45.820
You think you could help me out?

14:45.865 --> 14:47.696
Got to take a look
at your books first.

14:47.733 --> 14:48.927
What seems to be your problem?

14:48.968 --> 14:50.959
Well, the usual.

14:51.003 --> 14:52.766
-Money.
-Do you have a credit line?

14:52.805 --> 14:54.602
No.

14:54.640 --> 14:56.107
Well, if you qualify,
that might be something

14:56.142 --> 14:58.133
l could arrange to help you
with your cash flow problems.

14:58.177 --> 14:59.667
Great.

14:59.712 --> 15:00.974
My club is draining me.

15:01.013 --> 15:03.504
-Slow summer?
-Well, a lot of new competition.

15:03.549 --> 15:05.710
l was hoping that if l could
get some money together,

15:05.751 --> 15:07.446
l could reinvent the place.

15:07.486 --> 15:08.646
Bring the heat back.

15:08.688 --> 15:09.746
lt's a great space.

15:09.789 --> 15:11.051
Well, it sounds like
you have a vision.

15:11.090 --> 15:12.682
That along with passion
and hard work

15:12.725 --> 15:14.625
are always a good foundation
for success.

15:14.660 --> 15:15.820
Well, l hope you're right.

15:15.861 --> 15:17.886
Me, right?

15:17.930 --> 15:19.090
lt's been known to happen.

15:19.131 --> 15:20.928
Don't you worry
about a thing, Valerie.

15:20.967 --> 15:22.025
l'll do everything
l can for you.

15:23.469 --> 15:24.401
l'm your man.

15:24.437 --> 15:27.099
Sounds good to me.

15:34.113 --> 15:35.444
-Hey, Kel.
-Hi.

15:35.481 --> 15:36.914
You look great.

15:36.949 --> 15:38.712
oh, thanks. Do you think it's
okay for the wrap party?

15:38.751 --> 15:41.515
Between you and me,
we'll be lucky if we ever wrap

15:41.554 --> 15:43.215
-that stupid video.
-Yeah, what's going on?

15:43.256 --> 15:44.746
Aren't you supposed to be
filming right now.

15:44.790 --> 15:47.020
Yeah, the company's filming
down at the beach.

15:47.059 --> 15:50.085
l'm babysitting Taz Botel.
He insisted on peace and quiet,

15:50.129 --> 15:52.256
so David sent him off with me.
He's sleeping in my room.

15:52.365 --> 15:54.526
ooh, maybe we should have
the sheets bronzed.

15:54.567 --> 15:57.661
Yeah, he has to be up
and back by 2:00 or else.

15:57.703 --> 15:58.635
''or else,'' what?

15:58.671 --> 15:59.899
David explodes.

15:59.939 --> 16:01.770
He's so stressed, it's scary.

16:01.807 --> 16:04.503
Well, you're not letting
him take it out on you are you?

16:04.543 --> 16:06.534
No. No, not a chance.

16:06.579 --> 16:07.910
God! could you have a more

16:07.947 --> 16:09.437
freaking uncomfortable bed?

16:11.751 --> 16:13.218
oh, l, l'm sorry.

16:13.252 --> 16:15.584
So are you ready
to go back to work?

16:15.621 --> 16:16.645
-No.
-No.

16:16.689 --> 16:19.021
-l hardly slept at all.
-oh...

16:19.058 --> 16:20.491
oh, God.

16:20.526 --> 16:21.720
What?

16:21.761 --> 16:22.887
-l know you.
-Huh?

16:22.928 --> 16:25.658
-No, l don't think you do.
-Hell, yes.

16:25.698 --> 16:28.098
l never forget a face,
or any other

16:28.134 --> 16:30.398
body parts for that matter.

16:30.436 --> 16:32.495
lt's one of my gifts.

16:32.538 --> 16:34.768
l think you're mistaken, Taz.

16:34.807 --> 16:36.104
This is my friend, Kelly Taylor.

16:36.142 --> 16:37.666
This is Taz Botel from Bad cow.

16:37.710 --> 16:39.041
Hi.

16:39.078 --> 16:40.102
Exactly.

16:40.146 --> 16:42.910
Kelly Taylor.

16:42.948 --> 16:45.348
Right here before me.

16:45.384 --> 16:48.148
oh, cover girl,

16:48.187 --> 16:49.711
Seventeen magazine.

16:50.956 --> 16:53.982
May 1994. one of my
personal favorites.

16:54.026 --> 16:56.859
That was a long time ago.
How did you know that?

16:56.896 --> 16:59.126
oh, l had a girlfriend

16:59.165 --> 17:00.860
used to read Seventeen
all the time.

17:00.900 --> 17:03.027
l can't believe
l'm meeting you.

17:03.069 --> 17:05.127
l mean, we have got
to chat, girl.

17:05.171 --> 17:06.798
There's so much
that l want to know.

17:08.207 --> 17:09.606
You know, maybe we could do this

17:09.642 --> 17:11.200
on the way back to the shoot?

17:11.277 --> 17:12.675
Perfect. Perfect. Perfect.

17:12.712 --> 17:13.906
l'll let Kelly hear my song.

17:13.945 --> 17:15.675
Yeah, unless you're busy?

17:19.151 --> 17:21.118
No. l'd love to go.

17:21.153 --> 17:23.121
-oh...
-Great, great.

17:24.423 --> 17:25.515
Me and Kelly Taylor.

17:30.429 --> 17:32.420
Please?

17:45.144 --> 17:47.806
So you've been on the road
all this time by yourself?

17:47.847 --> 17:49.940
Yeah, pretty much.

17:49.982 --> 17:51.506
l'll tell you something though.

17:51.550 --> 17:55.008
This country that we live in
is huge and unbelievable.

17:55.054 --> 17:57.022
l think
about the people that l've met

17:57.056 --> 17:58.250
and the things that l've seen.

17:58.290 --> 18:00.258
lt's, uh, it's been
a great trip.

18:00.326 --> 18:03.386
Hmm, then you had to get stuck
in this one-horse town.

18:03.429 --> 18:05.659
come to think of it,
l haven't seen that horse yet.

18:05.698 --> 18:07.529
Where's he hiding out anyway?

18:09.068 --> 18:10.899
Now, wait a minute.

18:10.936 --> 18:13.370
l know there has to be a girl
waiting for you

18:13.406 --> 18:15.374
back in L.A.?

18:15.408 --> 18:16.602
Not any more.

18:16.642 --> 18:17.768
See, she was

18:17.810 --> 18:19.607
supposed to come with me
on this trip.

18:19.645 --> 18:21.840
l think l got
over her somewhere

18:21.881 --> 18:24.179
between Grand Junction
and Denver.

18:27.253 --> 18:29.050
How about you?

18:29.088 --> 18:30.214
How about me, what?

18:30.256 --> 18:31.655
l've never traveled anywhere.

18:32.892 --> 18:34.484
l've read a lot, though.

18:34.527 --> 18:36.893
l've always wanted to go
to New York and work there.

18:36.929 --> 18:37.896
As a librarian?

18:37.930 --> 18:39.227
Uh, hopefully not.

18:39.298 --> 18:40.595
No, l...

18:40.633 --> 18:43.067
l've saved up a little money.

18:43.102 --> 18:44.535
l want to be a writer.

18:44.570 --> 18:46.470
There's a book l'm researching.

18:46.505 --> 18:47.597
What's it about?

18:47.640 --> 18:48.937
Angels.

18:49.975 --> 18:51.943
of course.

18:51.977 --> 18:53.774
So what's been keeping you here?
certainly not your job.

18:53.813 --> 18:55.110
l was in a relationship.

18:55.147 --> 18:57.809
oh, yes, the old relationship.

18:57.850 --> 18:58.942
Mm-hmm.

18:58.984 --> 19:01.885
But like you, l got over it.

19:01.921 --> 19:03.081
You want to talk about it?

19:03.122 --> 19:04.282
You want to talk about yours?

19:04.323 --> 19:06.120
-Not a chance.
-Me, neither.

19:14.700 --> 19:17.897
Believe in nothing

19:17.937 --> 19:20.963
Don't trust your brother

19:21.006 --> 19:23.975
Do what l say

19:24.009 --> 19:27.137
Don't love your lover

19:27.179 --> 19:29.909
You want to survive
Do you want to survive?

19:29.949 --> 19:32.349
Well, l want to survive

19:32.384 --> 19:33.544
ln my eyes

19:33.586 --> 19:35.178
All you gotta do is

19:39.425 --> 19:42.326
Don't be, don't be

19:42.361 --> 19:43.760
Don't be

19:43.796 --> 19:45.161
What you can't be

19:45.197 --> 19:48.223
Don't be, don't be

19:48.300 --> 19:49.927
Don't be

19:49.969 --> 19:51.493
What you can't be

19:51.537 --> 19:54.768
Don't be, don't be

19:54.807 --> 19:56.035
Don't be

19:56.075 --> 19:59.135
What you can't be...

20:02.114 --> 20:04.912
Kelly!

20:04.950 --> 20:06.941
cut!

20:08.187 --> 20:10.018
What's going on?
The shot looked great.

20:10.055 --> 20:11.181
Sorry, man.

20:11.223 --> 20:12.383
l just remembered.

20:12.424 --> 20:14.221
l never asked Kelly
if she liked the song.

20:14.260 --> 20:16.091
oh, what and you've
got to do it now?

20:16.128 --> 20:18.619
Yeah, l do. You got
a problem with that?

20:18.664 --> 20:21.064
No. No, no problem.

20:21.100 --> 20:23.864
Good. Stay right there.

20:25.004 --> 20:27.097
Kelly.

20:27.139 --> 20:28.265
lt looks great.

20:28.307 --> 20:29.501
-oh, you like it?
-Mm-hmm.

20:29.542 --> 20:31.271
What the hell were you
thinking inviting Kelly here?

20:31.377 --> 20:32.969
What, are you trying
to ruin our career?

20:33.012 --> 20:35.173
-l thought it would help.
-Yeah, well, it didn't.

20:35.214 --> 20:37.444
Well, excuse me.

20:37.483 --> 20:39.781
How could you get him
so distracted by Kelly?

20:39.818 --> 20:41.046
l thought it would...

20:41.086 --> 20:42.451
No, you know what?

20:42.488 --> 20:45.013
l don't have to explain
myself to you.

20:45.057 --> 20:47.617
Taz, get your butt
on set right now!

20:47.660 --> 20:49.059
What was that?

20:51.263 --> 20:54.096
She's right. You should
probably get up there.

20:54.133 --> 20:55.395
-l should?
-oh, yeah, yeah.

20:55.434 --> 20:57.163
Definitely.

20:57.202 --> 20:59.602
You owe it... to the song.

20:59.638 --> 21:02.402
oh. okay.

21:02.441 --> 21:04.238
You know, l've been thinking
this song sucks,

21:04.276 --> 21:05.470
but if you like it, Kelly...

21:05.511 --> 21:08.241
oh, no. l love it.

21:08.314 --> 21:09.645
cool.

21:15.454 --> 21:16.944
Let's rock and roll!

21:31.337 --> 21:32.895
Play back.

21:32.938 --> 21:35.600
Action!

22:03.936 --> 22:05.494
Steve!

22:05.537 --> 22:07.698
Steve... hi.

22:07.740 --> 22:08.934
Hey, Val.

22:08.974 --> 22:11.238
Hi.

22:11.310 --> 22:12.368
oh, l'm so glad you're home.

22:12.411 --> 22:13.571
l missed you.

22:13.612 --> 22:16.206
Hey, l missed being home.
l missed you, too.

22:16.248 --> 22:17.579
-So, how did you get here?
-oh!

22:17.616 --> 22:20.983
l'm sorry, but that's
a very, very big secret.

22:22.054 --> 22:24.181
But you're supposed
to be in Texas.

22:24.223 --> 22:25.918
That's exactly

22:25.958 --> 22:28.654
what l want
a certain little honey...

22:28.694 --> 22:30.787
to think.

22:30.829 --> 22:32.262
-ooh.
-No.

22:32.297 --> 22:33.662
No, what?

22:33.699 --> 22:35.758
l'm gonna surprise the
hell out of clare today.

22:37.336 --> 22:39.861
l'm gonna wrap her in
my well-tanned arms.

22:39.905 --> 22:40.963
l'm gonna squeeze her

22:41.006 --> 22:43.065
with all the monkey
love that l got.

22:45.377 --> 22:46.935
Steve, listen to me, uh...

22:46.979 --> 22:48.378
You don't think
she'll be surprised?

22:48.414 --> 22:50.006
Well, Brandon and Nat
are the only people

22:50.049 --> 22:51.539
that know that l'm here so far.

22:51.583 --> 22:53.141
l've been keeping it
very low-key.

22:53.185 --> 22:56.154
oh, no, uh, she'll be surprised.

22:56.188 --> 22:58.850
She just flew to Texas
to surprise you.

22:58.891 --> 23:01.052
Valerie, you lie.

23:01.093 --> 23:02.492
No, l wish.

23:02.528 --> 23:04.291
l just saw her this afternoon.

23:05.330 --> 23:07.230
She was going to the Alamo.

23:07.332 --> 23:08.822
You're not kidding?

23:10.636 --> 23:12.126
lt will be all right.

23:12.171 --> 23:13.468
All right?

23:13.505 --> 23:14.733
l'm here; she's there.

23:14.773 --> 23:16.434
What's all right?

23:16.475 --> 23:17.703
She's gonna kill me.

23:17.743 --> 23:19.335
No, she'll appreciate
your gesture.

23:19.378 --> 23:20.777
She can't fault
your motives.

23:20.813 --> 23:22.804
No, she'll just maim me
below the waist.

23:22.848 --> 23:24.782
No, she'll understand,
and she'll forgive you.

23:24.817 --> 23:26.842
l mean, you flew back here
because you love her.

23:26.885 --> 23:28.716
Man, l should have
never left Brandon.

23:28.754 --> 23:29.948
How is he doing?

23:29.988 --> 23:32.479
Him? He'll be lucky if he
gets here by Labor Day.

23:32.524 --> 23:35.152
Well, at least he's not
rushing back to see Kelly.

23:36.795 --> 23:38.194
Valerie!

23:38.230 --> 23:39.197
oh, what, what?

23:39.231 --> 23:40.198
oh!

23:40.232 --> 23:41.699
l need a ride to the airport.

23:41.734 --> 23:43.759
Uh, well, where are you going?

23:43.802 --> 23:44.791
l'm going to Texas.

23:44.837 --> 23:46.270
l can still catch her.

23:52.911 --> 23:54.469
Hey, check it out.

23:54.513 --> 23:56.140
Hey, guys, what's going on?

23:57.182 --> 23:58.274
Nothing.

23:58.317 --> 24:00.114
ls something wrong
with the part?

24:03.122 --> 24:04.214
Nope.

24:04.256 --> 24:05.382
Well, when's it gonna be done?

24:05.424 --> 24:06.391
Do you mind?

24:06.425 --> 24:07.915
He's busy.

24:07.960 --> 24:09.086
Where's Lee?

24:09.128 --> 24:10.152
He's gone.

24:10.195 --> 24:11.856
Big wreck up on the interstate.

24:11.897 --> 24:13.956
Be working through the night
sorting it out.

24:13.999 --> 24:15.557
Yeah, but he promised me
it would get done.

24:15.601 --> 24:16.761
Uh-huh.

24:16.802 --> 24:18.667
Well, Mr. L.A....

24:18.704 --> 24:20.638
l don't know what to tell you.

24:22.007 --> 24:24.635
Maybe you can get it fixed
faster at some coon garage.

24:24.676 --> 24:27.236
Know of any
good places, Mariah?

24:27.346 --> 24:29.507
What exactly
is your problem, Lamar?

24:29.548 --> 24:30.742
come on, come on.

24:30.783 --> 24:31.750
come on, Brandon.

24:31.784 --> 24:32.808
Stop.

24:32.851 --> 24:34.250
You know we don't
talk to trash.

24:34.353 --> 24:35.786
Yeah, Mariah's always been

24:35.821 --> 24:37.721
an uppity African-American
''coon-ess''.

24:37.756 --> 24:39.155
ls that the proper term?

24:39.191 --> 24:41.250
-Yeah. -l think
you owe the lady an apology.

24:41.326 --> 24:42.258
Uh, Brandon, stop.

24:42.327 --> 24:44.227
Now, please.

24:44.263 --> 24:45.389
come on.

24:45.430 --> 24:47.022
He's not worth it.

24:47.065 --> 24:49.158
That's not what your mama said.

24:49.201 --> 24:50.566
He's not worth it.

24:50.602 --> 24:52.536
Brandon, stop it, won't you?

24:52.571 --> 24:54.766
Lee will be back tomorrow.

24:56.708 --> 24:58.972
Let it go. Let it go.

24:59.011 --> 25:00.911
Lee will fix your car
in the morning

25:00.946 --> 25:02.538
and whip the hell out of Junior.

25:02.581 --> 25:03.741
He's a good man.

25:03.782 --> 25:05.807
Then, how did his son
end up like that, huh?

25:05.851 --> 25:06.818
l don't know.

25:06.852 --> 25:08.183
Sometimes bigotry
skips a generation.

25:08.220 --> 25:09.778
Well, that's comforting.

25:09.822 --> 25:11.619
Uh, Brandon, listen.

25:11.657 --> 25:14.125
Maybe you should wait
for your car without me.

25:22.034 --> 25:23.365
ls that what you want?

25:24.403 --> 25:25.995
No, not at all.

25:26.038 --> 25:29.633
l just... you know,
if you wanted to walk away now,

25:29.675 --> 25:31.472
l understand.

25:40.452 --> 25:42.420
come on.

25:42.454 --> 25:44.251
Where are we going?

25:44.289 --> 25:46.348
l don't know.

26:02.975 --> 26:03.964
Hey, Nat.

26:04.009 --> 26:04.998
Hey, how are you?

26:05.043 --> 26:06.510
Hi.

26:06.545 --> 26:08.740
-Hi.
-oh, Joan, you look great.

26:08.780 --> 26:10.304
l feel great.

26:10.349 --> 26:11.748
l didn't think you guys
were coming.

26:11.783 --> 26:12.977
Neither did Donna
when she invited us,

26:13.018 --> 26:13.985
but Joanie insisted.

26:14.019 --> 26:15.418
Well, l'm gonna be

26:15.454 --> 26:17.115
a married woman
in a couple of weeks,

26:17.155 --> 26:19.020
and who knows
when l'll get out again?

26:19.057 --> 26:22.720
-So, where is Donna?
-Well, they just finished up.

26:22.761 --> 26:24.194
She's probably
around here somewhere.

26:38.877 --> 26:41.141
Kelly, where have
you been hiding?

26:41.179 --> 26:42.441
Hey, Taz.

26:42.481 --> 26:44.108
Um, l'd like you to meet
some friends-- this is Nat

26:44.149 --> 26:45.377
and Joan.

26:45.417 --> 26:46.441
-Hi.
-Hello.

26:46.485 --> 26:47.452
And Valerie.

26:47.486 --> 26:48.510
Hi.

26:48.553 --> 26:50.043
lt's nice to meet you.

26:50.088 --> 26:52.249
Uh, l was just talking
to your bass player,

26:52.291 --> 26:53.485
and, uh, Nat and l own

26:53.525 --> 26:54.617
this club in Beverly Hills,

26:54.660 --> 26:56.252
and l think it'd be perfect
for you

26:56.295 --> 26:58.490
to come down
and do your unplugged show.

26:58.530 --> 27:00.430
Kelly, l got
to apologize to you.

27:00.465 --> 27:02.160
l can't see you this evening.

27:02.200 --> 27:05.567
l foolishly, foolishly made
previous arrangements which...

27:05.604 --> 27:06.866
-l can't get out of.
-oh.

27:06.905 --> 27:08.463
l understand.

27:08.507 --> 27:10.975
But tomorrow is another day.

27:11.009 --> 27:13.102
And l'm not leaving
L.A. till the evening,

27:13.145 --> 27:15.136
so why don't we just
make plans right now?

27:15.180 --> 27:16.204
l couldn't.

27:16.248 --> 27:17.306
l already have plans.

27:17.349 --> 27:18.509
Break them.

27:18.550 --> 27:20.415
l can't-- it's for school.

27:20.452 --> 27:22.317
l start my work
at a care facility tomorrow.

27:23.488 --> 27:25.217
Kelly, l need care.

27:25.257 --> 27:26.383
Don't l count?

27:26.425 --> 27:28.655
lt's not like that, Taz.

27:28.694 --> 27:30.821
l'm volunteering
in an AlDS hospice.

27:33.765 --> 27:35.630
Uh...

27:42.541 --> 27:44.475
So sorry.

27:44.509 --> 27:45.840
My dates beckon me.

27:47.045 --> 27:49.912
-Cjao,
-Cjao,

27:51.016 --> 27:53.507
Well, that was a real
conversation ender.

27:53.552 --> 27:55.952
Are you serious about
helping out at a hospice?

27:55.988 --> 27:57.751
Yes, l think so.

27:57.789 --> 28:00.519
l'd say spending the day
with Taz seems more lively.

28:00.559 --> 28:02.823
or are you just going through
some kind of martyr phase?

28:02.861 --> 28:05.625
l'm not even gonna dignify that
with a response.

28:05.664 --> 28:07.723
Ladies, ladies.

28:07.766 --> 28:08.960
Where is Steve?

28:09.001 --> 28:10.434
l know it's supposed
to be a secret,

28:10.469 --> 28:11.834
but he said he
was gonna be here.

28:11.870 --> 28:13.633
Some secret. l just took him
to the airport.

28:13.672 --> 28:15.833
He's on his way to Texas
to catch up with clare.

28:15.874 --> 28:17.136
What?

28:17.175 --> 28:19.939
clare just called from Texas
looking for Steve.

28:19.978 --> 28:21.809
l told her

28:21.847 --> 28:23.212
that l heard
he was already home.

28:23.281 --> 28:24.680
She's probably flying back
right now.

28:31.156 --> 28:34.023
Attention, ladies and gentlemen.

28:34.059 --> 28:35.026
Hi, ma'am.

28:35.060 --> 28:36.118
can you please tell me what time

28:36.161 --> 28:37.492
the next flight
to San Antonio is leaving?

28:37.529 --> 28:38.496
l don't know, sir.

28:38.530 --> 28:39.895
All outgoing flights
have been grounded

28:39.931 --> 28:41.523
due to unstable
weather conditions.

28:41.566 --> 28:42.897
Unstable-- how could that be?

28:42.934 --> 28:44.128
l just arrived
without a problem.

28:44.169 --> 28:46.137
We apologize
for the inconvenience,

28:46.171 --> 28:47.195
but there's been reports

28:47.239 --> 28:48.831
of a wind shear
in the Houston area.

28:48.874 --> 28:51.069
For safety's sake,
we have to wait it out.

28:51.109 --> 28:52.133
This is nuts.

28:52.177 --> 28:53.405
l'm trying to see
my girlfriend.

28:53.445 --> 28:55.106
can't you just give me
some idea of the time?

28:55.147 --> 28:57.047
l wish l could, sir. Next.

28:57.082 --> 28:58.413
Please.

28:58.450 --> 28:59.974
A general announcement
for all...

29:00.018 --> 29:01.144
We're next.

29:02.187 --> 29:04.121
We are currently
experiencing delays

29:04.156 --> 29:06.488
due to extreme
weather conditions.

29:06.525 --> 29:10.461
We will keep you apprised of any
further updates as they develop.

29:10.495 --> 29:12.224
Thank you for your patience.

29:28.647 --> 29:30.080
Miss!

29:30.115 --> 29:32.845
Miss, please, just take
a look at this ticket now.

29:55.941 --> 29:59.377
So, have l apologized enough?

29:59.411 --> 30:01.038
Just forget about it.

30:01.079 --> 30:02.637
We survived.

30:04.116 --> 30:06.141
Yeah, we got a lot
of good work done.

30:06.184 --> 30:08.448
l think it's gonna
cut together well.

30:08.487 --> 30:10.682
Well, don't think about
it until tomorrow.

30:10.722 --> 30:12.189
You'll be fresher.

30:17.262 --> 30:18.957
Should we be worrying?

30:18.997 --> 30:21.124
l mean, no one
from MZA even showed up.

30:21.166 --> 30:22.724
Not even Budman.

30:22.767 --> 30:24.064
No.

30:24.102 --> 30:26.332
l mean, maybe he was busy.

30:28.106 --> 30:30.040
Yeah, well,
at least Taz promised

30:30.075 --> 30:32.202
he'd put a good word in for us.

30:32.244 --> 30:34.474
See, l told you things
would work out.

30:36.982 --> 30:38.279
oh, boy.

30:38.316 --> 30:39.510
What? Who's here?

30:39.551 --> 30:41.018
Budman's secretary.

30:42.721 --> 30:44.211
-Barbara, hey.
-Hi.

30:44.256 --> 30:45.382
Where's Erik?

30:45.423 --> 30:46.913
Erik couldn't make it.

30:46.958 --> 30:49.791
Actually, he wanted me to
tell you that he's been let go.

30:49.828 --> 30:51.295
Let go?

30:51.329 --> 30:52.455
What?

30:52.497 --> 30:53.521
Just like that?

30:53.565 --> 30:54.998
company's downsizing.

30:55.033 --> 30:56.022
Don't worry about Erik.

30:56.067 --> 30:57.295
Erik knows how
to land on his feet.

30:57.402 --> 30:58.801
Yeah, well,
where does that leave us?

30:58.837 --> 31:00.429
l mean, our contracts
are up for review

31:00.472 --> 31:02.201
-in two weeks.
-l don't know.

31:02.240 --> 31:03.969
He said that somebody would be
getting in touch with you.

31:05.010 --> 31:06.739
ls there any food left?

31:06.778 --> 31:09.474
Yeah, yeah, if you hurry up.

31:09.514 --> 31:10.776
okay. Thanks.

31:13.084 --> 31:14.676
You okay?

31:14.719 --> 31:16.516
Yeah.

31:16.555 --> 31:19.786
David, don't be worried.

31:19.824 --> 31:22.452
Love coming down on me

31:22.494 --> 31:25.088
Love making me dizzy

31:25.130 --> 31:28.930
Love that's shaping my heart

31:28.967 --> 31:32.095
l don't know what you...

31:37.075 --> 31:40.567
Somebody's hungry over there.

31:40.612 --> 31:42.273
Hope you're not
just being polite.

31:42.380 --> 31:43.404
Uh-uh.

31:43.448 --> 31:44.642
The chicken was fantastic.

31:44.683 --> 31:45.672
So were the potatoes.

31:45.717 --> 31:47.116
My compliments to the chef.

31:47.152 --> 31:49.950
Well, if my granny knew
l was heating up

31:49.988 --> 31:53.651
her home cooking
in a microwave, she'd flip.

31:53.692 --> 31:55.421
Where is your granny?

31:55.460 --> 31:57.223
Mmm... New orleans.

31:57.262 --> 31:58.854
Visiting friends.

31:59.898 --> 32:00.956
She's a great old lady.

32:00.999 --> 32:02.830
l guess she's
kind of the reason l stayed

32:02.867 --> 32:04.334
around here,
working in the library.

32:05.370 --> 32:06.667
She's a book lover?

32:06.705 --> 32:07.694
No, uh-uh.

32:07.739 --> 32:08.933
No, she never had the chance.

32:08.974 --> 32:10.566
Um, you know,
when she was my age,

32:10.609 --> 32:12.008
she wasn't even allowed
in that building.

32:12.043 --> 32:13.203
Whites only, you understand?

32:14.246 --> 32:16.908
So, l guess there has been
a little progress in this town.

32:16.948 --> 32:18.916
Well, there you go.

32:19.951 --> 32:21.680
What's it like in Los Angeles?

32:23.288 --> 32:25.381
Just like any other city,
l guess.

32:25.423 --> 32:27.983
Good people and bad people
sharing the same space.

32:30.028 --> 32:31.222
The world we live in.

32:31.263 --> 32:32.855
Unfortunately.

32:32.897 --> 32:34.831
You want some coffee?

32:34.866 --> 32:35.855
Yeah, thanks.

32:35.900 --> 32:36.992
lt's chicory.

32:37.035 --> 32:38.366
Sounds good.

32:39.971 --> 32:43.031
So, you'll be looking forward to
getting back to school, l guess.

32:43.074 --> 32:44.371
Uh, l don't know.

32:44.409 --> 32:46.240
l haven't really figured
out what l'm gonna do

32:46.278 --> 32:48.075
-this year.
-What do you mean?

32:48.113 --> 32:50.206
Well, last year, l was involved
with the school paper,

32:50.248 --> 32:54.207
but, uh, it's about the last
place l want to be this year.

32:55.253 --> 32:57.084
Why is that?

32:58.123 --> 32:59.090
oh.

32:59.124 --> 33:00.113
This has to do

33:00.158 --> 33:01.523
with that little girl,
doesn't it?

33:03.094 --> 33:05.119
Ah, you read me like a book.

33:05.163 --> 33:06.596
You know what?

33:06.631 --> 33:07.723
Forget the coffee.

33:07.766 --> 33:08.755
Do you like the blues?

33:08.800 --> 33:10.700
-Absolutely.
-come on.

33:10.735 --> 33:13.033
That's one place
Hadley city is not backward.

33:13.071 --> 33:15.562
come on, get your plate,
bring it to the kitchen.

33:15.607 --> 33:17.939
Southern women

33:18.943 --> 33:22.401
Just love Southern women

33:23.448 --> 33:27.179
Southern women

33:27.218 --> 33:29.015
Really know how to cook

33:31.456 --> 33:34.118
And when they make
sweet love

33:34.159 --> 33:37.253
They really don't read
no book

33:39.464 --> 33:41.432
Well, l'm going down south

33:41.466 --> 33:45.300
l'm gonna fill up
my whiskey cup

33:48.039 --> 33:50.701
And when they make sweet love

33:50.742 --> 33:54.872
They really don't,
really don't read no book.

34:00.218 --> 34:02.846
Don't forget-- have a good time,
we'll be right back.

34:02.887 --> 34:06.721
-We got more.
-oh, yeah, oh, yeah.

34:06.758 --> 34:07.725
Wow.

34:07.759 --> 34:09.818
l knew you would say wow.

34:09.860 --> 34:12.159
-oh, you did, did you?
-Mm-hmm.

34:12.197 --> 34:14.427
Well, did you know that
Michael Bolton and John Tesh

34:14.466 --> 34:15.728
are going to cover that song

34:15.766 --> 34:17.701
for their new album
Frankenstejn jn Polyester?

34:17.735 --> 34:18.760
You'd better be kidding.

34:18.803 --> 34:20.498
-l am kidding.
-Excuse me.

34:20.538 --> 34:22.505
Daniel.

34:22.540 --> 34:24.531
-Uh...
-Hiya, baby.

34:24.576 --> 34:26.134
Brandon, this, this is Daniel.

34:26.177 --> 34:27.235
Hey, Daniel, how you doing?

34:27.277 --> 34:29.940
Good.

34:29.981 --> 34:31.175
can l ask you a question...

34:31.216 --> 34:32.376
alone?

34:32.417 --> 34:33.384
l'll be right back.

34:33.418 --> 34:34.976
You know what?

34:41.393 --> 34:44.123
What do you think you're doing
with Daniel's girl?

34:44.161 --> 34:45.789
l just came here
for the music, man.

34:46.831 --> 34:49.800
Where you from, fool?

34:52.704 --> 34:53.795
And you are?

34:53.838 --> 34:56.237
Someone who can tie
your honky white butt up

34:56.274 --> 34:59.072
in a timber hitch
and kick it from here to GA.

34:59.110 --> 35:00.805
That's who.

35:00.845 --> 35:02.335
ls that so?

35:09.988 --> 35:11.956
Brandon, it...

35:11.990 --> 35:13.582
it appears as though
we're offending some people.

35:13.625 --> 35:15.855
-Do you want to leave?
-Sure.

35:15.894 --> 35:16.861
Mariah, we still need to talk.

35:16.895 --> 35:18.226
No, you need to listen.

35:18.296 --> 35:20.059
lt is over between us.

35:20.098 --> 35:21.588
l can be seen
with whoever l want,

35:21.633 --> 35:23.396
whatever color.

35:27.505 --> 35:28.767
Take me home, Brandon.

35:28.807 --> 35:30.798
okay.

35:32.510 --> 35:34.478
What are you doing?

35:34.512 --> 35:35.774
What is this?

35:35.814 --> 35:38.248
Are you threatening him?
Are you threatening him?

35:38.283 --> 35:40.046
You're just as bad
as a Hadley city redneck.

35:40.084 --> 35:41.051
You know that?

35:41.085 --> 35:42.848
Yeah, you do.

35:42.887 --> 35:43.854
come on.

35:43.888 --> 35:46.049
Sorry about that.

35:46.090 --> 35:48.217
Not as sorry as l am.

36:03.041 --> 36:05.168
ln just a few minutes,

36:05.210 --> 36:09.772
we'll begin boarding our 6:30
A.M. departure for San Antonio.

36:09.814 --> 36:12.544
Please proceed to gate 103
at this time

36:12.584 --> 36:15.382
and have your boarding cards
available for the gate agent.

36:15.420 --> 36:17.911
Thank you.

36:22.727 --> 36:24.024
clare?

36:26.397 --> 36:27.591
clare!

36:27.632 --> 36:30.396
Steve?

37:06.704 --> 37:08.672
What are you doing here?

37:08.706 --> 37:10.765
l was trying to surprise you,
you knucklehead.

37:10.808 --> 37:12.639
Why weren't you
where you were supposed to be?

37:12.677 --> 37:14.008
l couldn't help it;
l wanted to see you.

37:14.045 --> 37:15.012
l wanted to see you, too.

37:15.046 --> 37:16.138
Mm, l wanted to hold you.

37:16.180 --> 37:17.579
Mm, l wanted to hold you, too.

37:17.615 --> 37:18.877
So you're not mad at me?

37:18.917 --> 37:20.384
of course l'm mad at you.

37:20.418 --> 37:24.445
You're going to be punished
again and again.

37:24.489 --> 37:25.683
ooh, where are we going?

37:25.723 --> 37:26.747
The nearest motel.

37:26.791 --> 37:28.190
Are you threatening
me with a good time?

37:28.226 --> 37:29.215
You die.

37:29.260 --> 37:30.454
Hey, you know what today is?

37:30.495 --> 37:31.985
-What?
-Dress-up day.

37:32.030 --> 37:34.021
ooh...

37:48.313 --> 37:49.405
Good morning.

37:51.683 --> 37:55.084
Good morning.

37:55.119 --> 37:56.245
How long have you been up?

37:56.354 --> 37:57.252
A while.

37:57.355 --> 37:58.913
l went down to the garage.

37:58.957 --> 38:00.447
Lee's almost done with your car.

38:00.491 --> 38:01.856
-Excellent.
-Yeah.

38:01.893 --> 38:03.827
He said he should have you
up and at 'em in no time,

38:03.861 --> 38:05.158
so come on and get up.

38:05.196 --> 38:07.426
l got you some corn muffins
and some regular coffee

38:07.465 --> 38:09.057
because l didn't think
you liked the chicory.

38:09.100 --> 38:10.328
oh, thanks.

38:10.368 --> 38:13.531
Mm-hmm.

38:13.571 --> 38:17.871
Are, uh, are you trying
to get rid of me?

38:17.909 --> 38:20.173
Yes, l am, so go and eat your
corn muffin while it's hot.

38:20.211 --> 38:23.772
Well, you know, l don't have
to leave right away.

38:23.815 --> 38:25.874
l was thinking
maybe you could...

38:25.917 --> 38:27.851
show me the sights
of Hadley city.

38:27.885 --> 38:29.785
There's got to be a diner
around here somewhere

38:29.821 --> 38:31.789
that Elvis overate in
and then vomited,

38:31.823 --> 38:33.222
or maybe there's a house
around here

38:33.257 --> 38:34.815
-he's still living in.
-Maybe.

38:34.859 --> 38:36.884
Uh, Brandon, l'd love
to give you the grand tour.

38:36.928 --> 38:39.590
So why are you kicking me
out the door?

38:45.069 --> 38:49.233
There's a bus leaving
for St. Louis in an hour.

38:49.340 --> 38:51.399
From there,
l can transfer to New York.

38:51.442 --> 38:53.967
You're really going?

38:54.012 --> 38:56.378
l'm already packed.

39:01.586 --> 39:03.520
Good for you.

39:18.369 --> 39:19.336
Hello.

39:19.370 --> 39:22.339
Hello, Valerie.

39:22.373 --> 39:23.340
lt's Kenny Bannerman.

39:24.609 --> 39:26.099
-Hi, there.
-Hi.

39:26.144 --> 39:28.203
l just wanted you to know that l
went over your books last night,

39:28.246 --> 39:29.577
and l think
l can get you some cash.

39:29.614 --> 39:30.478
A bank loan?

39:30.515 --> 39:31.482
or an SBA.

39:31.516 --> 39:32.483
We'll float 'em both out there

39:32.517 --> 39:34.075
and see which one looks
more attractive.

39:34.118 --> 39:34.846
Great.

39:34.886 --> 39:36.080
And, um...

39:36.120 --> 39:37.553
...l-l'm gonna be gone
most of this week,

39:37.588 --> 39:38.987
but as soon as l get back,

39:39.023 --> 39:40.820
l promise to devote
some real attention to this.

39:40.858 --> 39:41.847
okay?

39:41.893 --> 39:43.588
Well, l was hoping
you'd say that.

39:43.628 --> 39:45.220
of course,
l might need to see you again

39:45.329 --> 39:47.627
just to go over a few details.

39:47.665 --> 39:49.599
Well, l'm all yours.
Just call.

39:49.634 --> 39:52.034
Good.

39:52.070 --> 39:53.469
l'm sorry if l woke you up.

39:53.504 --> 39:56.496
-lt's okay, no problem.
-Tough night?

39:56.541 --> 39:59.374
Well, they're all tough
when you're alone.

39:59.410 --> 40:02.811
Well, you, you never know when
your luck's going to change.

40:02.847 --> 40:04.712
Have a good week.

40:04.749 --> 40:06.717
You, too.
Bye.

40:06.751 --> 40:07.979
Bye.

40:22.467 --> 40:24.435
-Hey.
-Hey.

40:24.469 --> 40:25.663
l have room in this load,

40:25.703 --> 40:27.261
so if you want anything
washed, strip right now.

40:27.338 --> 40:28.737
oh, l've got a much better idea.

40:28.773 --> 40:31.765
What do you say we go up to MZA
and hang around the offices?

40:31.809 --> 40:33.276
And do what?

40:33.377 --> 40:35.436
check it out,
see what's going on.

40:35.480 --> 40:38.745
David, we've been working
for four weeks straight.

40:38.783 --> 40:40.375
You know what l want
to do today?

40:40.418 --> 40:44.377
l want to do my laundry, l want
to put my feet up, sit back,

40:44.422 --> 40:45.855
have an apricot-peach smoothie,

40:45.890 --> 40:48.484
and watch this fashion video
my dad taped for me.

40:48.526 --> 40:52.292
And that's what you really
want to do?

40:52.396 --> 40:56.492
Well, l realize it might not be
a day two can play, but...

40:57.535 --> 41:00.026
oh, no, it's just...

41:00.071 --> 41:02.505
Donna, there's a lot of people
we need to be talking to.

41:02.540 --> 41:03.973
And what do we say?

41:04.008 --> 41:06.738
l don't know.

41:06.778 --> 41:09.042
Then let's not say anything.

41:09.080 --> 41:11.207
Let's just,
let's just see what happens

41:11.249 --> 41:13.843
'cause maybe we should
just stay freelance

41:13.885 --> 41:15.477
because l don't ever want
to be pressured

41:15.520 --> 41:17.181
into working
with another Bad cow.

41:17.221 --> 41:18.688
l hated their music,
l hated Taz,

41:18.723 --> 41:20.918
l-l hated everything about them.

41:20.958 --> 41:21.947
Do me a favor, okay?

41:21.993 --> 41:23.620
When we go up to the offices,

41:23.661 --> 41:25.151
please don't say
anything about that.

41:25.196 --> 41:27.460
l'm not going up to the offices.

41:27.498 --> 41:30.228
But, Donna, we need a game plan.

41:30.268 --> 41:31.667
Maybe we should shop
our stuff around

41:31.702 --> 41:32.930
until MZA makes up their mind.

41:32.970 --> 41:35.063
Maybe we can shaft them
for the way they treated us.

41:35.106 --> 41:37.438
David, we're starting school
in three weeks.

41:37.475 --> 41:38.703
Let's not make this
so complicated.

41:38.743 --> 41:40.734
Let's not shaft anybody.

41:40.778 --> 41:45.272
Let's just be thankful for the
opportunity and the experience.

41:45.349 --> 41:46.577
Well, l'm not.

41:46.617 --> 41:48.209
l got a taste and l want more.

41:48.252 --> 41:49.947
How can you even
think about going

41:49.987 --> 41:51.545
back to school after this?

41:51.589 --> 41:53.147
l am gonna do my laundry now.

41:53.191 --> 41:54.681
-Good-bye. -You know, Donna,
you really need

41:54.725 --> 41:57.592
to take this partnership
a little more seriously.

41:57.628 --> 41:58.720
Yeah, l have.

41:58.763 --> 41:59.730
And you know what?

41:59.764 --> 42:00.731
l want out.

42:00.765 --> 42:02.756
What?

42:02.800 --> 42:04.392
Donna, you can't quit on me.

42:04.435 --> 42:06.369
l'm sorry, David,
my mind is made up.

42:06.404 --> 42:08.565
lf you walk now, there's
no guarantees about anything.

42:08.606 --> 42:11.632
The way you've been acting,
l don't want any.

42:19.350 --> 42:21.944
You all set?

42:21.986 --> 42:23.920
All set.

42:23.955 --> 42:25.479
Enjoy the Alamo.

42:25.523 --> 42:28.549
l think l'm gonna remember
Hadley city a lot more.

42:28.593 --> 42:29.582
Thanks for your hospitality.

42:29.627 --> 42:30.594
My pleasure.

42:32.864 --> 42:34.092
Well, good luck with your book.

42:34.131 --> 42:35.359
Thank you.

42:35.399 --> 42:36.991
l'm sure you'll make
a chapter all by yourself.

42:37.034 --> 42:38.763
Me?
l'm not an angel.

42:38.803 --> 42:41.601
No, but if you
hadn't come along,

42:41.639 --> 42:43.197
l probably wouldn't be going
anywhere.

42:44.375 --> 42:46.900
So you may be proof
that angels do exist.

42:46.944 --> 42:48.241
l think you might
be reaching there.

42:48.279 --> 42:49.507
Ah, maybe, but...

42:49.547 --> 42:51.811
...something had
to bring us together.

42:51.849 --> 42:52.941
Yeah.

42:52.984 --> 42:54.975
-So you have my address?
-Yes,

42:55.019 --> 42:56.213
and if you're ever
in New York...

42:56.254 --> 42:57.846
-l'll find you.
-okay.

42:57.889 --> 43:00.084
So, um...

43:03.594 --> 43:05.391
-l guess you better get going.
-Yeah, okay.

43:06.430 --> 43:08.523
-Bye, Brandon.
-Bye, Mariah.

43:25.850 --> 43:28.410
-Bye.
-Bye.
