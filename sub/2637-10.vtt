00:02.152 --> 00:06.054
No, see, the liquid-metal terminators
were created in the future by Skynet...

00:06.222 --> 00:08.281
...and Skynet was developed
by Miles Dyson...

00:08.458 --> 00:12.417
...but that future no longer exists
due to Dyson's death in Terminator 2.

00:12.595 --> 00:15.155
Okay, then riddle me this.

00:15.331 --> 00:16.992
Assuming all the good terminators...

00:17.167 --> 00:19.795
...were originally evil terminators
created by Skynet...

00:19.969 --> 00:23.029
...then reprogrammed by the future
John Connor, why would Skynet...

00:23.206 --> 00:25.106
...an artificial computer intelligence...

00:25.275 --> 00:29.473
...bother to create
a petite, hot, 17-year-old killer robot?

00:31.347 --> 00:33.440
Skynet is kinky? I don't know.

00:34.451 --> 00:37.978
Artificial intelligences
do not have teen fetishes.

00:38.154 --> 00:41.180
- All right, wait. They use it to lure-
- Eh! Too late, I win.

00:56.873 --> 00:58.841
What the hell is that?

00:59.709 --> 01:02.940
I don't know. But if cats could sing...

01:03.113 --> 01:04.808
...they'd hate it too.

01:14.657 --> 01:15.783
Hey, guys.

01:15.959 --> 01:18.154
- Hi, where are you going?
- What?

01:18.328 --> 01:21.729
We just had to mail some letters.

01:21.898 --> 01:25.061
And throw away some chicken.

01:42.452 --> 01:44.352
You'll never guess what just happened.

01:44.521 --> 01:45.988
- I give up.
- I don't guess.

01:46.156 --> 01:49.751
As a scientist, I reach conclusions
based on observation and experimentation.

01:50.727 --> 01:54.219
Although it occurs to me, you may
have been employing a rhetorical device...

01:54.397 --> 01:56.262
...rendering my response moot.

01:57.300 --> 02:00.497
- What was that?
- Believe it or not, personal growth.

02:00.670 --> 02:01.694
What happened?

02:01.871 --> 02:06.001
Remember when I auditioned for Rent but
I didn't get it and I couldn't figure out why?

02:06.176 --> 02:08.167
I have a conclusion
based on an observation.

02:08.344 --> 02:09.368
No, you don't.

02:09.545 --> 02:10.842
No, he doesn't.

02:11.281 --> 02:14.910
The girl picked to play Mimi, she dropped
out and they asked me to replace her.

02:15.084 --> 02:17.882
- Oh! Congratulations, what a lucky break.
- It's not a big a deal.

02:18.054 --> 02:20.818
Just one night,
but they invite casting people and agents.

02:20.990 --> 02:22.014
So you never know.

02:22.192 --> 02:24.626
- I think I know.
- No, you don't.

02:25.195 --> 02:28.255
- He doesn't.
- It's this Friday at 8, you guys wanna come?

02:28.431 --> 02:29.591
- No.
- No.

02:31.267 --> 02:36.136
Because Friday,
we are attending a symposium...

02:36.306 --> 02:37.898
...on molecular positronium.

02:38.074 --> 02:41.202
- I think that's a week from Tuesday at 6.
- No, it's this Friday.

02:41.778 --> 02:44.508
- At 8.
- Oh, too bad.

02:44.681 --> 02:46.945
- I gotta get to rehearsal. See you guys.
- See you.

02:52.889 --> 02:55.016
- You just lied to Penny.
- Yes, I did.

02:55.191 --> 02:56.522
And you did it so casually.

02:56.693 --> 02:59.628
No rapid breathing,
no increase in perspiration.

02:59.796 --> 03:02.026
- So?
- So lack of a physiological response...

03:02.198 --> 03:05.998
...while lying
is characteristic of a violent sociopath.

03:06.169 --> 03:08.467
Sheldon, are you worried
about your safety?

03:08.638 --> 03:12.768
No. I imagine if you were going to kill me,
you'd have done it a long time ago.

03:13.209 --> 03:15.370
That's very true.

04:01.891 --> 04:03.119
Leonard?

04:03.293 --> 04:04.555
Leonard?

04:04.727 --> 04:06.752
- Leonard?
What?

04:08.631 --> 04:10.462
I need to speak to you.

04:10.633 --> 04:12.965
- It's 2:00 in the morning.
- It's important.

04:13.136 --> 04:15.730
I highly doubt that.

04:15.905 --> 04:17.896
Go away.

04:21.678 --> 04:23.839
Are you still out there?

04:24.480 --> 04:26.038
Yes.

04:27.850 --> 04:29.477
What?

04:30.353 --> 04:32.844
You're right, it can wait until morning.

04:34.891 --> 04:37.086
What, what, what?
- Never mind.

04:37.260 --> 04:39.785
I clearly woke you up
in the middle of a REM cycle.

04:39.963 --> 04:43.364
- You're in no state of mind to talk.
- Sheldon, what is it?

04:44.934 --> 04:48.028
I'm uncomfortable
having been included in your lie to Penny.

04:48.638 --> 04:51.835
- What was I supposed to say?
- You could have told her the truth.

04:52.008 --> 04:53.635
That would have hurt her feelings.

04:54.444 --> 04:56.708
Is that a relevant factor?

04:56.879 --> 04:58.107
Yes.

04:58.281 --> 05:00.306
Then I suppose
you could have agreed to go.

05:00.483 --> 05:02.974
And what would I have said afterwards?

05:03.152 --> 05:05.211
I would suggest something
to the effect of:

05:05.388 --> 05:08.789
"Singing is neither an appropriate vocation
nor avocation for you...

05:08.958 --> 05:12.155
...and if you disagree, I recommend
a CAT scan to look for a tumor...

05:12.328 --> 05:15.855
...pressing on the cognitive
processing centers of your brain. "

05:17.166 --> 05:18.258
I couldn't say that.

05:18.434 --> 05:22.734
I would have to say, "You were terrific
and I can't wait to hear you sing again. "

05:23.373 --> 05:25.068
Why?

05:25.241 --> 05:27.038
It's the social protocol.

05:27.210 --> 05:28.234
It's what you do...

05:28.411 --> 05:31.812
...when you have a friend who's proud
of something they really suck at.

05:32.815 --> 05:34.248
I was not aware of that.

05:34.417 --> 05:37.011
- Well, now you are.
- Oh, all right.

05:37.186 --> 05:38.676
- Leonard?
- Yes?

05:38.855 --> 05:42.723
When we played chess earlier, you were
terrific, and I can't wait to play you again.

05:42.892 --> 05:44.416
Good night.

05:48.898 --> 05:50.490
Leonard? Leonard?

05:50.666 --> 05:53.032
Leonard? Leonard?

05:53.202 --> 05:56.399
This would be so much easier
if I were a violent sociopath.

05:56.572 --> 05:59.006
Leonard? Leonard?

06:00.209 --> 06:02.541
- What?
- I was analyzing our lie...

06:02.712 --> 06:05.772
...and I believe we're in danger
of Penny seeing through the ruse.

06:06.215 --> 06:08.149
- How?
- Simple.

06:08.317 --> 06:13.482
If she were to log on to www.
socalphysicsgroup. org/activities/other...

06:13.656 --> 06:17.217
...click on upcoming events, scroll to
seminars, download the PDF schedule...

06:17.393 --> 06:20.191
...and look for the seminar
on molecular positronium, then...

06:20.363 --> 06:24.060
...bippity boppity boo,
our pants are metaphorically on fire.

06:28.738 --> 06:32.105
Well, sir, my trousers
will not be igniting today.

06:34.610 --> 06:35.804
Penny?

06:35.978 --> 06:37.206
Penny?

06:37.380 --> 06:38.972
Penny?

06:39.549 --> 06:40.675
Good morning.

06:40.850 --> 06:43.580
- Do you have any idea what time it is?
- Of course I do.

06:43.753 --> 06:47.519
My watch is linked to the atomic clock
in Boulder, Colorado.

06:47.690 --> 06:50.158
It's accurate to one-tenth of a second.

06:50.326 --> 06:52.521
As I'm saying this
it occurs to me once again...

06:52.695 --> 06:55.255
...your question may
have been rhetorical.

06:55.698 --> 06:56.892
What do you want?

06:57.066 --> 06:59.330
Remember how Leonard told you
we couldn't come...

06:59.502 --> 07:02.994
...because we were attending a symposium
on molecular positronium?

07:04.674 --> 07:07.404
I remember symposium.

07:08.277 --> 07:10.507
Yes, well, he lied.

07:11.214 --> 07:12.772
Wait, what?

07:12.949 --> 07:16.214
He lied, and I'm feeling
very uncomfortable about it.

07:16.385 --> 07:18.444
Well, imagine how I'm feeling.

07:19.889 --> 07:21.186
Hungry?

07:22.692 --> 07:24.489
Tired?

07:24.660 --> 07:27.356
I'm sorry, this really isn't my strong suit.

07:28.030 --> 07:29.395
You told her I lied?

07:29.565 --> 07:31.430
Why would you tell her I lied?

07:32.001 --> 07:33.935
To help you.

07:34.770 --> 07:36.397
I'm sorry, I'm not seeing the help.

07:36.572 --> 07:38.904
She was going to see
through your lie eventually...

07:39.075 --> 07:41.543
...so I told her that you were lying
to protect me.

07:42.979 --> 07:45.539
Oh, I'm getting a bad feeling.

07:45.715 --> 07:47.410
Hunger?

07:48.251 --> 07:49.275
Indigestion?

07:49.452 --> 07:51.545
I'm sorry,
I'm really not very good at this.

07:51.988 --> 07:54.684
Anyway, Penny now believes
that on Friday night...

07:54.857 --> 07:59.521
...we're going to participate
in my cousin Leopold's drug intervention.

08:00.496 --> 08:01.690
Your cousin Leopold.

08:01.864 --> 08:04.389
Whom most people call Leo,
but he also answers to Lee.

08:04.567 --> 08:06.000
Remember that, it's important.

08:06.435 --> 08:08.528
- What's important?
- Details, Leonard.

08:08.704 --> 08:12.868
The success or failure
of our deceitful enterprise turns on details.

08:13.042 --> 08:16.569
- Do you have a cousin Leopold?
- No, I made him up.

08:17.280 --> 08:19.748
I think you'd call him Lee.

08:20.816 --> 08:24.582
I don't get it. I already told her a lie,
why replace it with a different lie?

08:24.754 --> 08:27.552
Well, first of all,
your lie was laughably transparent...

08:27.723 --> 08:30.157
...where mine is exquisitely convoluted.

08:31.360 --> 08:35.854
While you were sleeping,
I was weaving an un-unravelable web.

08:36.032 --> 08:38.432
- Un-unravelable?
- Yes.

08:38.601 --> 08:41.535
If she Googles Leopold Houston,
she'll find a Facebook page...

08:41.703 --> 08:44.264
...an online blog
depicting his descent into drug use...

08:44.440 --> 08:48.137
...and a desperate
yet hopeful listing on eHarmony. com.

08:49.011 --> 08:52.845
Okay, why would I go
to a drug intervention for your cousin?

08:53.015 --> 08:56.212
Ah! Because it's in Long Beach
and I don't drive.

08:57.620 --> 08:58.814
We're going to Long Beach?

08:58.988 --> 09:01.855
Of course not, there's no cousin Leo,
there's no intervention.

09:02.024 --> 09:04.618
- Focus, Leonard.
- Oh, come on.

09:05.494 --> 09:08.793
We just leave the house on Friday night
and return in the wee hours...

09:08.965 --> 09:12.731
...emotionally wrung out from the work
of convincing Leo to go back into rehab.

09:12.902 --> 09:14.392
So he goes back into rehab?

09:14.570 --> 09:19.803
Yes, but he can relapse if Penny
ever invites us to hear her sing again.

09:21.410 --> 09:22.877
You still told her I lied.

09:23.045 --> 09:24.307
Yeah, for a noble purpose.

09:24.480 --> 09:28.246
To spare me the social embarrassment
of having a drug-addled first cousin.

09:28.417 --> 09:31.147
- Which I'm assuming is embarrassing, yes?
- I don't know.

09:32.688 --> 09:36.488
- How am I supposed to remember all this?
- That's the best part, you don't have to.

09:36.659 --> 09:40.652
I told Penny that you would be embarrassed
if you knew she found out you had lied...

09:40.830 --> 09:44.732
...so she's agreed to operate
as if the original lie is still in force.

09:47.403 --> 09:52.340
So she's expecting me to lie
about going to a symposium in Pasadena...

09:52.508 --> 09:57.502
...when in actuality, we're pretending to go
to a drug intervention in Long Beach.

09:58.014 --> 09:59.504
Un-unravelable.

10:04.585 --> 10:07.383
Oh, hey, Penny. Wow, look at you,
all ready for your showcase.

10:07.555 --> 10:09.045
- You look great.
Thanks.

10:09.223 --> 10:13.387
I just wanted to come by and wish you
guys luck with your symposium.

10:14.161 --> 10:15.458
Oh.

10:15.629 --> 10:18.063
- Well, thank you.
- You know, I gotta tell you.

10:18.232 --> 10:21.429
A lot of friends would let their friend
go alone, but that's not you.

10:21.602 --> 10:25.333
You are the kind of guy
who stands by a friend when...

10:25.506 --> 10:28.407
When he has a symposium to go to.

10:31.545 --> 10:33.809
I don't know what to say.

10:34.515 --> 10:37.882
- It's okay, Leonard.
- Oh, okay, all right, good.

10:38.719 --> 10:40.209
- Oh, boy, group hug.
- Uh-uh.

10:40.387 --> 10:44.346
- Uh-uh?
- Okay. So, what's up?

10:44.525 --> 10:48.655
Well, Penny is on her way to perform in
a one-night showcase production of Rent...

10:48.829 --> 10:52.094
...which we are unable to attend,
because we're going to a symposium...

10:52.266 --> 10:56.635
...on molecular positronium
given by Dr. Emil Farmanfarmian.

10:56.804 --> 11:01.298
Wait a minute, Farmanfarmian is speaking
and you're bogarting the symposium?

11:01.542 --> 11:04.978
- Howard, I'm sorry, we would've-
- No, no, you're quark-blocking us.

11:07.281 --> 11:09.476
I don't know what to say.

11:10.017 --> 11:11.041
Wow.

11:11.218 --> 11:13.186
- Howard-
- It's your Millennium Falcon...

11:13.354 --> 11:16.187
...you and Chewbacca do
whatever you wanna do.

11:17.491 --> 11:21.018
Me and Princess Leia here will find
some other way to spend the evening.

11:21.195 --> 11:22.822
Howard, wait.

11:22.997 --> 11:26.057
Sheldon, I think we should tell them.

11:27.234 --> 11:28.565
Okay, sure.

11:28.736 --> 11:30.294
I don't see a problem with that.

11:31.639 --> 11:33.630
There's no symposium.

11:33.807 --> 11:35.900
Leonard lied to me.
Isn't that right, Leonard?

11:36.076 --> 11:37.566
Well...

11:38.279 --> 11:41.737
- I don't know what to say.
- It's okay, I do.

11:41.916 --> 11:44.544
Look, Leonard is helping Sheldon
through a family crisis.

11:44.718 --> 11:49.348
He made up the whole story about
the symposium with Dr. Farmanfarmian-

11:49.523 --> 11:50.581
- Good for you.
- Ha! Yeah.

11:52.293 --> 11:56.161
He didn't want Sheldon to be embarrassed.
There's nothing to be embarrassed about.

11:56.330 --> 11:58.264
Every family in America has a relative...

11:58.432 --> 12:01.560
...holed up in a garage somewhere
huffing paint thinner.

12:02.269 --> 12:05.170
No, I'm lost too.
I think she skipped a step.

12:05.973 --> 12:10.376
Now, look, Sheldon's cousin Leo escaped
rehab and he's in a Motel 8 in Long Beach.

12:10.544 --> 12:12.808
The whole family's going out
for an intervention.

12:12.980 --> 12:15.676
Leonard is driving Sheldon down
to help him through this...

12:15.849 --> 12:19.683
-... because he's such a good man.
- Oh, another hug? Thank you.

12:21.155 --> 12:23.646
- All right, you guys. Good luck.
- Thanks, Penny.

12:23.824 --> 12:25.553
- Break a leg.
- Yeah, break a leg.

12:27.127 --> 12:28.526
So road trip to Long Beach.

12:28.696 --> 12:31.062
- We're not going to Long Beach.
- Why not?

12:31.231 --> 12:34.291
Because Sheldon doesn't have
a drug-addicted cousin Leopold.

12:34.468 --> 12:36.231
Oh, too bad.

12:36.971 --> 12:39.235
I've always wanted to go to Long Beach.

12:39.406 --> 12:42.204
It's a very nice community.
The Queen Mary is docked there.

12:42.376 --> 12:45.743
Once the largest liner in the world,
it's now a hotel and restaurant...

12:45.913 --> 12:48.939
...where they host a surprisingly gripping
murder-mystery dinner.

12:49.850 --> 12:50.874
- Sounds fun.
- I'm game.

12:51.051 --> 12:53.281
- Shotgun.
- No, no, no.

12:53.988 --> 12:57.389
Leonard gets nauseous unless
he sits in front, and even then it's iffy.

12:59.126 --> 13:02.618
Wait, are we really going to Long Beach?

13:09.436 --> 13:12.337
Leonard? Leonard? Leonard?

13:12.506 --> 13:14.167
Let it go, Sheldon.

13:14.341 --> 13:17.640
The murderer was the first mate
whether it makes sense to you or not.

13:18.912 --> 13:20.777
No, that's the least of our worries.

13:20.948 --> 13:22.779
I've been doing research on addiction...

13:22.950 --> 13:25.111
...both the biochemical
and behavioral aspects...

13:25.285 --> 13:28.516
...and I think there's a problem
with the current version of our lie.

13:28.689 --> 13:31.658
What are you talking about?
It's fine, she bought it, it's over.

13:35.562 --> 13:37.757
Sadly, it's not.

13:37.931 --> 13:39.831
Substance abuse is a lifelong struggle.

13:40.000 --> 13:42.525
But beyond that,
I have realized the Leo I described...

13:42.703 --> 13:46.434
-... would not have agreed to go to rehab.
- Why not?

13:46.607 --> 13:48.040
Because Leo's a middle child.

13:48.809 --> 13:52.108
There's no Leo. How can you say that?

13:55.349 --> 13:57.840
You didn't read the bio, did you?

13:58.018 --> 14:01.078
He's not just a middle child,
he is the quintessential middle child.

14:01.255 --> 14:03.951
From a broken home, to boot.
Psychologically speaking...

14:04.124 --> 14:07.560
...the attention he gets by rebelling,
even to the point of destruction...

14:07.728 --> 14:10.697
...is more emotionally valuable
than help he would get at rehab.

14:10.864 --> 14:12.729
- I've got a solution.
- Great. What is it?

14:12.900 --> 14:15.198
Get out.

14:16.070 --> 14:17.537
Fine.

14:23.444 --> 14:25.071
I've hesitated to point this out...

14:25.245 --> 14:27.679
...but I must remind you
we are in our predicament...

14:27.848 --> 14:30.146
...because of your initial
and inadequate deceit.

14:30.317 --> 14:32.376
I'm just trying to clean up
after your mess.

14:36.690 --> 14:38.624
We'll talk in the morning.

14:51.105 --> 14:52.766
Morning.

14:53.340 --> 14:54.705
Who are you?

14:55.509 --> 14:57.101
I am Sheldon's cousin Leo.

14:57.277 --> 14:59.677
Oh, God.

15:02.249 --> 15:04.717
Sheldon does not have a cousin Leo.

15:04.885 --> 15:06.614
Au contraire.

15:06.787 --> 15:08.049
I'm 26 years old...

15:08.222 --> 15:13.558
...I'm originally from "Denton, Texas,"
but I was a Navy brat.

15:13.727 --> 15:16.719
I was brought up on a variety
of military bases around the world.

15:16.897 --> 15:20.333
As a result, I've often felt like an outsider,
never really fitting in...

15:20.501 --> 15:22.969
...probably the reason
for my substance-abuse problem.

15:23.137 --> 15:26.106
Excuse me, we just went over this.

15:26.273 --> 15:30.710
As the middle child, your addiction
is rooted in your unmet need for attention.

15:30.878 --> 15:33.642
Oh, Sheldon, are we really gonna go
with pop psychology?

15:33.814 --> 15:36.647
For your information,
this is all based on solid research.

15:36.817 --> 15:39.377
Just stick with the character profile
I wrote for you.

15:39.553 --> 15:41.145
- Sheldon?
- I'm sorry.

15:41.321 --> 15:42.879
Leonard, this is Toby Loobenfeld.

15:43.056 --> 15:45.786
He's a research assistant
in the particle-physics lab...

15:45.959 --> 15:49.087
...but he also minored in theater at MIT.

15:49.263 --> 15:51.128
It was more of a double major, actually.

15:51.498 --> 15:52.522
Theater and Physics.

15:52.699 --> 15:55.600
You can guess which one
my bourgeois parents pushed me towards.

15:55.769 --> 15:56.963
Yeah, I got it.

15:57.137 --> 15:59.071
Sheldon, why?

15:59.239 --> 16:01.799
You see, while Leo would not
have gone into rehab...

16:01.975 --> 16:05.968
...it is completely plausible that we would
have talked him into leaving the motel...

16:06.146 --> 16:08.307
-... and coming home with us.
- Oh...

16:08.582 --> 16:10.607
Sheldon, how about this
as my motivation?

16:10.784 --> 16:11.978
When I was 14 years old...

16:12.152 --> 16:16.179
...I was abused in the Philippines
by a clubfooted Navy chaplain.

16:17.758 --> 16:21.125
No, we're going with middle child
and a genetic predisposition...

16:21.295 --> 16:23.820
...to inadequate serotonin production.

16:23.997 --> 16:26.761
Swell, well, how do I play
genetic predisposition?

16:27.935 --> 16:30.096
Subtextually, of course.

16:33.140 --> 16:35.335
Just have fun with it.

16:40.180 --> 16:42.705
- Morning, Penny.
- Hi. How did the intervention go?

16:42.883 --> 16:45.784
Unfortunately, we weren't able
to convince him to go to rehab.

16:45.953 --> 16:49.150
Well, based on what you told me,
I'm not surprised.

16:51.625 --> 16:54.150
But we did convince him
to leave the motel.

16:54.328 --> 16:55.352
Come say hello.

16:57.097 --> 17:01.466
Leo, this is Penny,
our friend and neighbor.

17:01.635 --> 17:04.832
Hi, Leo, how are you feeling?

17:10.143 --> 17:11.666
Let me ask you something, Penny.

17:12.112 --> 17:16.377
Have you ever woken up in a fleabag motel
covered in your own vomit...

17:16.550 --> 17:19.314
...next to a transsexual prostitute?

17:22.256 --> 17:26.386
- No.
- Then don't ask me how I'm feeling.

17:28.895 --> 17:29.919
Well, that's Leo.

17:30.097 --> 17:34.363
Hey, why don't you tell me
about your showcase last night?

17:34.534 --> 17:35.728
Oh, it was okay, I guess.

17:35.902 --> 17:38.427
Wasn't a big turnout,
but they both seemed to like it.

17:39.106 --> 17:43.406
- There were only two people there?
- By the end, yeah.

17:43.610 --> 17:46.374
Damn you, Chaplain Horrigan.

17:48.348 --> 17:49.781
I'm sorry?

17:49.950 --> 17:51.918
The Philippines.

17:53.687 --> 17:55.814
1992.

17:55.989 --> 17:57.889
The Subic Bay Naval Station.

17:58.058 --> 18:01.050
A young boy on the cusp of manhood.

18:01.795 --> 18:06.630
His only companions,
mongrel dogs and malarial mosquitoes.

18:06.800 --> 18:10.133
Desperate and alone,
he reached out to a man...

18:10.304 --> 18:14.400
...who promised to introduce him
to a merciful, loving God...

18:14.574 --> 18:18.738
...but who instead introduced him
to a gin-pickled tongue...

18:18.912 --> 18:22.780
...shoved down his adolescent throat.

18:23.850 --> 18:25.249
What choice did he have...

18:25.419 --> 18:31.255
...but to drink, shoot
and snort his pain away?

18:31.425 --> 18:33.893
Don't forget genetic predisposition
towards addiction.

18:34.061 --> 18:35.085
Never been proven.

18:35.262 --> 18:37.662
- There have been studies.
- Not double-blind studies.

18:37.831 --> 18:40.299
How could there be?
Who would be the control group?

18:40.467 --> 18:42.526
As you can see,
detoxing can get pretty ugly.

18:42.703 --> 18:44.796
- Let's give them some privacy.
- Yeah.

18:44.971 --> 18:46.734
Do you wanna come over,
have coffee?

18:46.907 --> 18:49.933
- Sounds good.
- I have a video of me singing last night.

18:50.110 --> 18:51.941
Do you wanna see it?

18:52.179 --> 18:54.739
- Gee, why wouldn't I?
- This is even better...

18:54.915 --> 18:58.078
...than you coming to the showcase,
now I get to watch you watch me.

18:58.251 --> 18:59.582
Yeah.

19:00.620 --> 19:03.384
Funny how things work out.

19:03.957 --> 19:06.152
But he loved the companionship
and the wisdom...

19:06.326 --> 19:08.794
...that his own father failed to provide.

19:09.863 --> 19:11.694
Your parents made the right decision.

19:17.571 --> 19:20.233
I cannot work like this.

19:29.583 --> 19:35.180
This is amazing, just sitting on a couch
watching TV with a woman.

19:35.355 --> 19:40.793
Not being drunk or high
or wondering if you're a dude down there.

19:42.596 --> 19:46.123
Leo, you are a very sweet,
really funny guy.

19:46.299 --> 19:48.426
You're gonna do okay.

19:48.902 --> 19:50.927
One day at a time, Penny.

19:54.574 --> 19:56.769
One day at a time.

20:01.281 --> 20:03.943
How long is he going to stay here?

20:04.117 --> 20:07.848
He's a homeless drug addict, Leonard,
where is he going to go?

20:08.088 --> 20:10.784
Boy, you have a lot to learn about lying.
