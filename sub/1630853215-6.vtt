00:12.880 --> 00:16.720
Last night was my TED Talk,
and it couldn't have gone any better.

00:16.800 --> 00:19.880
Women who feel productive and creative
during their stay in prison

00:19.960 --> 00:22.600
are four times less likely to reoffend.

00:22.680 --> 00:24.120
Four.

00:24.200 --> 00:28.360
If desistance is where we want them to be,
how do we get them there?

00:29.560 --> 00:31.040
We sing.

00:31.120 --> 00:33.320
We sing and we desist.

00:33.920 --> 00:37.840
But it is business,
and there's a legal issue.

00:37.920 --> 00:40.080
-When isn't there?
-When nothing illegal has happened.

00:40.160 --> 00:41.320
Nothing illegal has happened.

00:41.400 --> 00:44.800
-What was the title of your TED Talk?
-"I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings."

00:44.880 --> 00:46.800
That does sound familiar.

00:46.880 --> 00:50.320
It is a pun based on the title
of a book by Maya Angelou.

00:50.400 --> 00:52.440
It's the exact title
of a book by Maya Angelou,

00:52.520 --> 00:55.600
which means it's not a pun, it's, um--
Oh, what do they call it?

00:55.680 --> 00:56.880
Plagiarism.

00:56.960 --> 00:59.960
It is a pun, and the matter
will be sorted by lunchtime.

01:00.040 --> 01:01.840
I'm waiting for their legal team
to call me.

01:01.920 --> 01:03.520
Oh, Laura, Laura, Laura.

01:03.600 --> 01:07.160
This is why you need me,
your wingman, your trusted number two.

01:07.240 --> 01:10.040
-Don't start this again.
-I would've spotted these silly mistakes.

01:10.120 --> 01:13.680
When will you ever learn there's no shame
in needing a number two?

01:13.760 --> 01:17.960
When will you ever learn
I don't need a number two?

01:18.040 --> 01:19.360
I bet you did last night.

01:19.440 --> 01:22.320
Think how more confident you would've felt
having a number two by the stage.

01:22.400 --> 01:24.920
Believe me, having a number two
by the side of the stage last night

01:25.000 --> 01:26.760
would have done very little
for my confidence.

01:28.960 --> 01:29.960
This would be them.

01:31.960 --> 01:32.960
Hello.

01:34.200 --> 01:35.200
Mm-hmm.

01:36.920 --> 01:37.960
Okay.

01:38.720 --> 01:39.920
Good to know.

01:40.560 --> 01:41.840
Thank you.

01:43.360 --> 01:46.200
I'm being sued by Maya Angelou's estate.

01:47.080 --> 01:48.400
Bloody hell.

01:48.480 --> 01:49.880
That sounds serious.

01:49.960 --> 01:51.040
It is.

01:52.560 --> 01:53.560
Are you okay?

01:54.840 --> 01:56.000
I need a shit.

02:05.600 --> 02:09.640
I know that, you know, people laugh
at the governor Laura and that,

02:09.720 --> 02:11.400
but she's doing it great
and I'm loving it.

02:11.480 --> 02:13.800
I'm loving it. I really love it,
and all the other girls are.

02:13.880 --> 02:16.800
They're really putting in the time
and I love it. I love it!

02:16.880 --> 02:18.000
I love it!

02:19.560 --> 02:22.360
I. Love. It.

02:23.440 --> 02:26.040
<i>Some good news just in.</i>

02:26.120 --> 02:29.040
Ange's trial has collapsed,
as we hoped it would.

02:29.120 --> 02:32.440
All charges have been dropped
and she is free to go.

02:32.520 --> 02:36.200
And as if that wasn't enough excitement
for one women's correctional facility,

02:36.280 --> 02:39.680
it is the first night
of <i>Songs From The Inside</i> .

02:39.760 --> 02:43.040
The joint is positively jumpin'.

02:46.240 --> 02:47.720
Look at his face.

02:49.240 --> 02:51.760
-Are you all packed up, Flange?
-Yeah, yeah.

02:51.840 --> 02:54.840
Just gotta settle up my room service bill,
then I'll be on me way.

02:56.040 --> 02:58.120
-Look, girls, I just want to say--
-Hold on.

02:58.200 --> 03:00.320
Let's just watch that lady fall
off that log.

03:04.240 --> 03:07.440
I-I don't--
I don't know what to say, really,

03:07.520 --> 03:10.000
other than thank you,

03:10.080 --> 03:12.600
all of you, for all of it.

03:12.680 --> 03:16.120
The friendship and the support
and the laughs

03:16.200 --> 03:19.400
-and for believing that I'm innocent.
-We're all innocent, love.

03:19.480 --> 03:21.960
Some more than others.

03:22.040 --> 03:26.240
Um, but what I just really want to say is,
um, just thank you for listening--

03:28.880 --> 03:30.520
Uh, sorry, Ange.

03:30.600 --> 03:33.120
It's all right.
Look, you lot have your fun.

03:33.200 --> 03:35.040
Bye.

03:36.200 --> 03:37.760
Good luck for the show tonight.

03:38.680 --> 03:42.720
I know we've had our differences,
but, um, I wish you well.

03:43.560 --> 03:45.600
Thanks. You too.

03:46.400 --> 03:47.400
Okay.

03:48.520 --> 03:51.760
Oh, you're not supposed
to say "good luck," are you?

03:51.840 --> 03:56.240
Because that brings bad luck or something.
It's, um, "break a leg," isn't it?

03:57.000 --> 03:58.320
Oh, well.

04:05.040 --> 04:06.840
For goodness' sake, Doug.

04:06.920 --> 04:09.080
Every time.

04:13.960 --> 04:16.880
I always know when she's coming,
but she falls for it…

04:17.640 --> 04:20.880
-For goodness' sake, Doug.

04:20.960 --> 04:22.800
…every time.

04:22.880 --> 04:24.240
Here she is.

04:24.320 --> 04:26.600
'Ey up. What's good today, then?

04:26.680 --> 04:27.880
Any recommendations?

04:27.960 --> 04:31.080
I keep having this recurring dream
about Cheryl.

04:31.160 --> 04:33.360
Steady, Gal,
there's a permanent record of this.

04:33.440 --> 04:35.840
Oh, no, it's not mucky.

04:35.920 --> 04:38.760
I'm in the Queen Vic, yeah,
waiting to be served.

04:38.840 --> 04:40.160
Cheryl's behind the bar.

04:40.240 --> 04:42.400
Now, it's not very busy
'cause it's a hot day,

04:42.480 --> 04:44.960
and there's a pop-up farmers market
in the square.

04:45.040 --> 04:47.960
Anyway, I'm really thirsty
and I'm trying to get her attention,

04:48.040 --> 04:49.720
but she keeps ignoring me.

04:49.800 --> 04:53.640
Then Dr. Legg walks in carrying
this big hoop that I jump through,

04:53.720 --> 04:55.880
but still, nothing from Cheryl.

04:55.960 --> 04:57.440
So, I say jokingly,

04:57.520 --> 04:59.960
"What's a bloke got to do
to get a drink around here?"

05:00.040 --> 05:01.920
And she leans over, and she says,

05:02.000 --> 05:04.760
"For God's sake, Gary,
why don't you fuck off?"

05:07.080 --> 05:09.360
I mean, what does that mean?

05:10.720 --> 05:12.760
Who could ever say, boo.

05:12.840 --> 05:14.240
Impenetrable.

05:20.760 --> 05:22.080
Funny old thing, ain't ya?

05:22.760 --> 05:23.880
Dreams?

05:31.840 --> 05:34.400
US southern state known for its mud pie.

05:34.480 --> 05:35.560
It's, um…

05:35.640 --> 05:37.480
Mississippi. Mississippi mud pie.

05:37.560 --> 05:40.200
-M-I-S-S-I-S-S-I-P-P-I.
-M-I-double-S-I-double-S-I-double-P-I.

05:40.280 --> 05:41.280
-What?
-What's your one?

05:41.360 --> 05:44.080
M-I-double-S-I-double-S-I-double-P-I.
What are you doing?

05:44.160 --> 05:47.240
M-I-S-S-I-S-S-I-P-P-I. Obvs.

05:47.320 --> 05:49.200
-Why do you do it that way?
-Why don't you?

05:49.280 --> 05:52.680
-Do you know how weird you both are?

05:52.760 --> 05:54.320
Mm-hmm.

05:54.880 --> 05:56.200
I shall write that in.

05:57.080 --> 06:00.160
But I shall say M-I-S-S-I-S-S-I-P-P-I.

06:00.240 --> 06:02.280
M-I-double-S-I-double-S-I-double-P-I.

06:02.360 --> 06:03.880
Ah, your one doesn't fit.

06:03.960 --> 06:04.960
-All right.

06:05.040 --> 06:06.920
I mean, how do they not see it?

06:07.000 --> 06:08.760
I don't object to the idea of a juice bar

06:08.840 --> 06:10.000
-in principle.
-Yes, you do.

06:10.080 --> 06:13.360
I just think along with the adult
soft-play area and the auditorium,

06:13.440 --> 06:15.240
there's not much room left
for an actual prison.

06:15.320 --> 06:17.800
That's ridiculous, isn't it? You know
I didn't ask for the auditorium.

06:17.880 --> 06:19.760
Any chance of a private word?

06:19.840 --> 06:22.040
Sure, yeah.
I'll just leave you to it, shall I?

06:22.120 --> 06:25.360
Hmm, I'm joking.
Of course you mean with me.

06:25.440 --> 06:26.640
Goodbye.

06:27.280 --> 06:29.040
-Be gone.

06:29.120 --> 06:33.440
-Come on in, Ros. What can I do for you?
-I-- I-I got this from-- from me mammy.

06:33.520 --> 06:35.720
I recognize the handwriting,
but I can't read.

06:35.800 --> 06:39.440
And she can read, but she don't speak.
And I don't trust anyone else.

06:39.520 --> 06:41.600
Why-- Why is she writing to me, Laura?

06:41.680 --> 06:45.800
Um, did something bad happen?
Is she not coming to see the show?

06:45.880 --> 06:48.400
'Cause she said she would,
and I know she really wants to.

06:48.480 --> 06:51.200
So, did-- did something bad happen to her?

06:51.280 --> 06:53.840
Okay, Ros. Just-- Why don't you
take a seat. Let me have a look.

07:03.040 --> 07:04.120
Is it bad?

07:05.280 --> 07:06.400
Um…

07:07.240 --> 07:08.920
Is she coming to see the show?

07:09.840 --> 07:11.240
No.

07:11.320 --> 07:12.320
Wh--

07:13.760 --> 07:14.760
Why?

07:15.400 --> 07:16.840
Why don't I, uh…

07:17.960 --> 07:19.520
Why don't I read it to you?

07:22.680 --> 07:24.360
"Dear Ros,

07:24.440 --> 07:26.440
I received the money. Thank you.

07:27.120 --> 07:29.440
But I haven't used it
to buy the camper van."

07:29.520 --> 07:30.640
What?

07:30.720 --> 07:32.800
"I'm sorry. I know this will be a shock.

07:33.880 --> 07:38.520
I can't go into details,
but I need to go away for both our sakes.

07:38.600 --> 07:41.680
I'm devastated I won't be able
to see your show,

07:41.760 --> 07:45.480
but I know you'll be really feckin good.

07:46.720 --> 07:50.520
So, sing your heart out for me,
my precious daughter.

07:51.320 --> 07:52.320
I love you.

07:53.480 --> 07:56.000
God bless. Mammy."

08:00.160 --> 08:02.880
Shit.

08:04.040 --> 08:05.480
She said that?

08:06.920 --> 08:08.000
Sh--

08:08.880 --> 08:10.200
She loves me.

08:11.040 --> 08:13.760
She loves me.

08:13.840 --> 08:15.920
I mean, I always knew
that she did…

08:16.000 --> 08:18.760
…but, you know,
to hear her say it, that's just--

08:18.840 --> 08:21.560
That's the best thing I've ever heard.

08:21.640 --> 08:24.360
This is everything.

08:24.440 --> 08:26.120
I'm gonna keep that forever.

08:27.600 --> 08:29.720
I can't wait to tell the other girls.

08:29.800 --> 08:31.880
Let 'em see it. Let 'em read it.

08:31.960 --> 08:34.400
My mammy loves me.

08:34.920 --> 08:36.000
Yeah, actually, Ros,

08:36.080 --> 08:38.880
I'm gonna have to just hang on to it
for a little while longer.

08:38.960 --> 08:40.760
Um, it's boring protocol stuff.

08:40.840 --> 08:42.799
Run it through the system,
blah, blah, blah.

08:42.880 --> 08:44.520
-And then you can have it back.
-Please.

08:44.600 --> 08:47.919
I will take special care of it, I promise.

08:48.000 --> 08:49.440
Thank you, Laura.

08:50.880 --> 08:52.400
You are most welcome.

08:59.120 --> 09:03.760
My mammy loves me.

09:14.480 --> 09:15.640
<i>"To Ros,</i>

09:15.720 --> 09:18.080
<i>by the time you read this,</i>
<i>I'll be long gone,</i>

09:18.160 --> 09:21.600
<i>and not in some poxy camper van,</i>
<i>but thanks for the money.</i>

09:21.680 --> 09:24.880
<i>I'm cutting off the deadwood.</i>
<i>You are the deadwood.</i>

09:24.960 --> 09:27.600
<i>And I'm not coming to see</i>
<i>your poofy show either,</i>

09:27.680 --> 09:28.920
<i>you feckin embarrassment."</i>

09:29.000 --> 09:30.640
Now speed it up. Speed it up.

09:30.720 --> 09:34.080
We're going so fast. We're going so fast!
We're going so fast!

09:35.040 --> 09:37.240
<i>"You were never the daughter</i>
<i>I wanted, anyways.</i>

09:37.320 --> 09:39.120
<i>God bless. Mammy."</i>

09:46.920 --> 09:49.800
Most of my inmates
have had dreadful lives.

09:50.440 --> 09:52.840
They've come
from unimaginable circumstances

09:52.920 --> 09:54.400
and I can't change that.

09:54.480 --> 09:59.000
But while they are here, with me,
that is where change can happen.

09:59.600 --> 10:03.320
No good would come
from Ros hearing her mother's vile words.

10:03.400 --> 10:07.120
It's about resetting the narrative,
sometimes literally.

10:08.080 --> 10:09.760
I had to fight really hard

10:09.840 --> 10:11.720
to make this musical happen.

10:11.800 --> 10:15.480
To convince people it isn't just about
prisoners singing songs.

10:15.560 --> 10:17.280
It's about so much more than that.

10:17.360 --> 10:21.080
It's about giving them purpose
and confidence and self-worth.

10:21.160 --> 10:24.920
Having something good in their lives,
perhaps for the first time.

10:26.200 --> 10:28.320
I want these women to fly.

10:29.400 --> 10:32.360
And I like to think
Maya Angelou would approve.

10:39.160 --> 10:43.160
Woo-hoo! Opening night's tonight!
Heather's done an amazing job with us.

10:43.240 --> 10:45.960
I know but I can't believe
we gotta perform it in front of people.

10:46.040 --> 10:47.720
Oh, shut up, you're making me nervous.

10:47.800 --> 10:50.600
I've puked twice already.
I'm fucking shit scared.

10:50.680 --> 10:52.600
My life, this is the best thing
I've ever done!

10:52.680 --> 10:55.880
It's the best thing any of us have done.
Let's hear it for our governor!

10:55.960 --> 10:57.080
-We love you!
-Love you, Laura!

10:57.160 --> 10:59.640
They let us
invite people. All our people are coming.

10:59.720 --> 11:01.280
It's great. All our families
are gonna see it.

11:02.360 --> 11:03.480
What she said!

11:18.880 --> 11:22.200
What's that? Your resignation letter
in case it all goes tits up tonight?

11:22.280 --> 11:26.360
Which it probably will,
so makes sense to get a jump start on it.

11:37.520 --> 11:39.240
Fuck off!

11:40.960 --> 11:43.200
Sometimes you've just got
to give it to her.

12:01.520 --> 12:03.080
-All right, everyone!

12:03.160 --> 12:06.240
-Big circle. Hold hands.
-Holding Heather's hand.

12:06.320 --> 12:09.280
Before you do, Heather,
we got you three a little something

12:09.360 --> 12:10.800
just to say thank you.

12:10.880 --> 12:12.400
Oh.

12:12.480 --> 12:15.160
You give us your time
and we really appreciate you.

12:15.240 --> 12:17.040
It means a lot and we'll never forget you.

12:17.120 --> 12:20.040
-Ah.

12:22.360 --> 12:24.440
That's a clay penis with the top cut off.

12:26.520 --> 12:27.960
Oh.

12:28.040 --> 12:30.160
Never again.

12:31.320 --> 12:33.120
-Not till the next time.

12:34.840 --> 12:36.200
One, two, three!

12:57.680 --> 12:59.000
I just farted.

13:00.760 --> 13:02.320
<i>I won't lie.</i>

13:02.400 --> 13:04.920
<i>There's a time when I'd have relished</i>
<i>this going wrong for her.</i>

13:05.000 --> 13:08.440
<i>Watch her humiliate herself again</i>
<i>with the same poor ideas, badly executed.</i>

13:08.520 --> 13:11.240
But this time feels different.

13:12.240 --> 13:13.240
What is it she says?

13:13.320 --> 13:15.480
"Rehabilitation through creativity,"
or something.

13:15.560 --> 13:17.880
I'm just joking.
That's exactly what she says.

13:18.560 --> 13:19.840
And I think she's right.

13:20.760 --> 13:21.960
Don't get me wrong,

13:22.040 --> 13:25.000
I still think she's a bit of a dick,
but you know what?

13:25.720 --> 13:27.320
Today's all about the win.

13:37.200 --> 13:40.080
I do feel quite nervous,
but, um, you know, it's not like--

13:40.160 --> 13:43.120
-I do know all the words and I know--
-What the fuck?

13:43.200 --> 13:44.800
Oh, my God. Have I pissed myself?

13:44.880 --> 13:47.120
Darling, it's all right.
Your waters have broken.

13:47.200 --> 13:49.200
-What's happened?
-What? But I'm not due yet.

13:49.280 --> 13:51.760
-She can't come today.
-Can we get some help, please?

13:51.840 --> 13:54.080
She's gone into labor. Come on, darling.
Let's get you out of here.

13:54.160 --> 13:56.320
Just checking, is there any chance
you have just pissed yourself?

13:58.040 --> 13:59.920
-Can you still sing?
-What's going on?

14:00.000 --> 14:00.920
It's a contraction.

14:01.000 --> 14:04.680
If you're certain, but only-- You know,
it's an hour and a half till curtain up.

14:04.760 --> 14:07.120
I'm pretty sure
she's having a baby, Heather.

14:07.200 --> 14:09.200
-Oh, my God.
-But she's playing the lead!

14:10.480 --> 14:12.000
Not now, Martin!

14:12.080 --> 14:13.080
My bad.

14:13.160 --> 14:14.360
Good luck with the baby!

14:14.440 --> 14:16.280
-Shit.
-What are we gonna do?

14:16.360 --> 14:19.240
-You're gonna have to do it.
-Oh, Jesus Christ.

14:19.320 --> 14:21.160
Hey, how are we getting on then, gang?

14:21.240 --> 14:23.920
For God's sake, Gary,
why don't you fuck off?

14:26.640 --> 14:27.880
Dream come true.

14:28.680 --> 14:29.720
Literally.

14:30.320 --> 14:32.280
-Panic over, Heather.

14:32.360 --> 14:34.760
What's got two thumbs
that's going to save the day?

14:34.840 --> 14:35.880
This one.

14:35.960 --> 14:37.960
No Charlee, no problem.

14:38.040 --> 14:39.040
I'll do it.

14:39.120 --> 14:41.600
I don't know any of her lines.
I don't know any of her songs.

14:41.680 --> 14:43.000
It doesn't matter.

14:43.080 --> 14:46.480
I'm gonna freestyle the shit out of this!

14:46.560 --> 14:48.080
And you're coming with me!

14:48.160 --> 14:49.880
It's my time to shine!

14:49.960 --> 14:51.920
Just follow my lead!

14:52.000 --> 14:54.040
I'm excited!

15:13.560 --> 15:15.800
On second thoughts, Heather,
she should do it.

15:15.880 --> 15:17.000
Great shout, Vivian.

15:19.640 --> 15:22.400
-Yeah!
-You saved the day!

15:22.480 --> 15:24.240
-I can't believe you!

15:31.320 --> 15:32.480
I did that.

15:32.560 --> 15:34.640
All right, everyone. You ready?

15:34.720 --> 15:36.440
Showtime!

15:37.880 --> 15:39.000
How lovely to see you.

15:42.320 --> 15:44.480
This is a great day.

15:44.560 --> 15:47.520
-All my favorite ladies in one room.
-Oh, yes.

15:47.600 --> 15:50.360
Mama Dede and Auntie Nala
will see my Rosalind

15:50.440 --> 15:51.800
-for the very first time.
-Yeah.

15:51.880 --> 15:54.640
We have already seen a photo.
She's a gift from heaven.

15:54.720 --> 15:58.680
-A very good match for our Sebastian.
-Hallelujah.

15:58.760 --> 16:01.520
So, Ros-- Rosalind is in it, yes.

16:01.600 --> 16:03.120
Thought I'd give it another go.

16:03.200 --> 16:05.720
Maybe my luck will change tonight. Nice to
show a bit of support though, isn't it?

16:05.800 --> 16:07.600
Very least,
I'll get another whiff of her hair.

16:07.680 --> 16:09.280
-Thank you for coming.
-Thank you.

16:09.360 --> 16:11.200
-Oh, hello.
-How are you? Yeah.

16:11.800 --> 16:13.000
I've got to go.

16:13.800 --> 16:15.600
Three weeks ago, there was no show.

16:15.680 --> 16:19.480
Now, we are teetering on the brink
of curtain up.

16:19.560 --> 16:22.640
Snatched victory
from the jaws of defeat, much?

16:23.440 --> 16:25.760
It's Laura, isn't it?
Heard so much about you, haven't we kids?

16:25.840 --> 16:28.120
Fantastic what you're doing here.
We're so excited, aren't we?

16:28.200 --> 16:30.520
Yeah, so excited!
Can't wait to see Mum on stage!

16:30.600 --> 16:33.000
You're the one
who got her that pretty dress, aren't you?

16:35.360 --> 16:38.840
All right, everyone.
We're ready to make our way through now.

16:59.160 --> 17:00.240
What's this for?

17:00.760 --> 17:02.440
<i>Oh, it's all happening.</i>

17:05.040 --> 17:07.600
Well, this is turning out
to be quite the day.

17:07.680 --> 17:10.000
-But we have a very fine…

17:10.079 --> 17:12.160
…albeit previously mute singer
to take your place.

17:12.240 --> 17:13.240
So we are peachy!

17:13.319 --> 17:16.960
-Don't worry, you haven't let anyone down.
-Yeah, that's not what I'm worried about.

17:17.040 --> 17:21.079
The show will go on.
This-- This hasn't ruined anything.

17:24.280 --> 17:27.680
I'll let you get on with it.
The ambulance is 20 minutes away.

17:27.760 --> 17:30.040
<i>Bonne chance.</i> Good luck. Knock 'em dead.

17:30.119 --> 17:32.319
-We've not got that long.
-Who's not got what now?

17:32.400 --> 17:33.960
This baby's coming now.

17:34.040 --> 17:36.920
This baby is coming now.
Well, I'll get out of your way then.

17:37.000 --> 17:38.520
-Laura.
-Yes?

17:38.600 --> 17:40.600
-Can you stay?
-Hmm?

17:40.680 --> 17:42.360
Please will you stay with me?

17:43.000 --> 17:45.720
You mean here? Not see the show?

17:46.400 --> 17:48.520
Please.

17:50.200 --> 17:51.200
Of course.

17:52.320 --> 17:53.480
Thank you.

18:03.840 --> 18:07.160
<i>How do I feel about</i>
<i>being excluded? It's killing me.</i>

18:09.280 --> 18:10.360
Fucking…

18:19.800 --> 18:21.960
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.

18:22.040 --> 18:24.000
I'm Cheryl Fergison,
and I've had the honor

18:24.080 --> 18:26.040
of directing these fantastic women.

18:28.880 --> 18:30.360
Cheryl Fergison.

18:30.440 --> 18:32.760
It's been a journey for all of us,
but throughout it all,

18:32.840 --> 18:34.720
I never doubted them for a second.

18:34.800 --> 18:38.160
So, without further ado,
let's get this party started!

18:38.240 --> 18:42.320
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give to you HMP Woldsley's production

18:42.400 --> 18:43.800
of <i>Songs From The Inside</i> .

18:45.520 --> 18:46.960
This is from my mammy.

18:50.160 --> 18:52.320
Sorry, Heather. Who's Cheryl?

18:52.400 --> 18:54.680
All right.
First positions, everyone. Come on.

19:10.120 --> 19:13.640
Can you hear that?
I hope it's going well for 'em.

19:37.440 --> 19:40.160
Oh! That is painful…

19:41.920 --> 19:44.680
…for both of us, I imagine.

19:45.440 --> 19:46.880
Whoo!

19:52.440 --> 19:54.520
I can't believe
I'm getting all my stuff back.

19:54.600 --> 19:57.800
-I'll go now.

19:57.880 --> 19:59.240
-You take care.
-Thank you.

20:16.200 --> 20:17.840
Oh! It's coming!

20:17.920 --> 20:23.480
-There, I can see something quite big…

20:23.560 --> 20:26.240
…out of something quite small!

20:28.440 --> 20:32.480
The thing is,
you just have to keep the fight,

20:33.240 --> 20:37.440
know who you are and that
your true self will win out in the end.

21:23.080 --> 21:24.680
That's what they call a ballad.

21:24.760 --> 21:27.120
-Just one more big push, okay?

21:27.200 --> 21:28.200
Okay?

21:28.920 --> 21:33.080
Incredible. There is a person
coming out of a person.

21:33.160 --> 21:35.160
You clever, clever girl.

21:47.920 --> 21:49.320
It's been a pleasure.

21:56.200 --> 21:59.280
<i>You see the very best</i>
<i>and the very worst of people in there.</i>

22:00.280 --> 22:02.360
<i>But all you've really got is each other.</i>

22:03.520 --> 22:07.160
<i>And if you don't understand that,</i>
<i>well, you're in trouble.</i>

22:14.600 --> 22:17.960
Some people understand
the importance of loyalty,

22:19.200 --> 22:22.600
<i>solidarity, sisterhood.</i>

22:28.120 --> 22:31.480
<i>Surround yourself</i>
<i>with those people if you can.</i>

22:37.200 --> 22:39.320
<i>And for those</i>
<i>who don't understand the power</i>

22:39.400 --> 22:40.960
<i>of standing shoulder to shoulder,</i>

22:41.040 --> 22:45.000
<i>well, I hope they learn</i>
<i>that lesson one day.</i>

22:54.200 --> 22:56.080
Well, it's never too late.

22:56.160 --> 22:58.720
Because like I always say,

22:58.800 --> 23:02.480
never underestimate
how good people can be.

23:03.200 --> 23:05.240
Not good.

23:06.760 --> 23:08.200
Stupid.

24:40.000 --> 24:45.120
I didn't know it was a real knife!
Why was it a real knife?

24:45.200 --> 24:46.920
Oh, my God, Rosalind!

25:10.840 --> 25:11.920
Do you want to hold?

25:15.440 --> 25:17.120
-Oh.

25:18.040 --> 25:21.080
All right. Yeah.

25:21.160 --> 25:23.720
Oh. Yeah.

25:23.800 --> 25:26.560
-Well, aren't you something?

25:28.880 --> 25:30.360
Laura, you've got to come with me.

25:30.440 --> 25:31.800
Dean.

25:32.960 --> 25:35.440
She's a boy.

25:36.200 --> 25:37.640
Now, Laura.

25:37.720 --> 25:40.800
Oh, you're my number two.
Can't you deal with it?

25:41.880 --> 25:43.000
Not this time.

25:43.720 --> 25:46.280
-Why?
-I want you to have him.

25:48.840 --> 25:51.200
-What?
-You'll be good at it.

26:11.960 --> 26:13.040
You Vicki?

26:16.840 --> 26:19.600
-Are we good?
-Yeah.
