WEBVTT

00:01.418 --> 00:03.420
The bad thing about television

00:03.420 --> 00:05.547
is that everybody

00:03.420 --> 00:05.547
you see on television

00:05.547 --> 00:08.550
is doing something

00:05.547 --> 00:08.550
better than what you're doing.

00:08.550 --> 00:11.303
You never see anybody on TV,

00:11.303 --> 00:13.138
like, just sliding off

00:11.303 --> 00:13.138
the front of the sofa

00:13.138 --> 00:14.974
with potato chip crumbs

00:13.138 --> 00:14.974
on their face.

00:14.974 --> 00:17.225
Some people have a little

00:14.974 --> 00:17.225
too much fun on television.

00:17.225 --> 00:19.186
The soda commercial people.

00:19.186 --> 00:22.940
Where do they summon

00:19.186 --> 00:22.940
this enthusiasm?

00:22.940 --> 00:24.316
Have you seen them?

00:24.316 --> 00:27.319
"We have soda! We have soda!

00:24.316 --> 00:27.319
We have soda!"

00:27.319 --> 00:31.740
Jumping, laughing,

00:27.319 --> 00:31.740
flying through the air.

00:31.740 --> 00:35.076
It's a can of soda.

00:35.076 --> 00:37.913
Have you ever been standing

00:35.076 --> 00:37.913
there and you're watching TV

00:37.913 --> 00:40.958
and you're drinking

00:37.913 --> 00:40.958
the exact product

00:40.958 --> 00:43.544
that they're advertising

00:40.958 --> 00:43.544
right there on TV?

00:43.544 --> 00:45.212
And it's like, you know,

00:45.212 --> 00:48.674
they're spiking volleyballs,

00:45.212 --> 00:48.674
jet skiing, girls in bikinis...

00:48.674 --> 00:49.967
and I'm standing there,

00:49.967 --> 00:52.177
"Maybe I'm putting

00:49.967 --> 00:52.177
too much ice in mine."

00:58.517 --> 00:59.977
So then, as we were leaving,

00:59.977 --> 01:01.729
we were just kind of

00:59.977 --> 01:01.729
standing there,

01:01.729 --> 01:03.647
and she was sort

01:01.729 --> 01:03.647
of smiling at me.

01:03.647 --> 01:05.816
I wasn't sure if she wanted me

01:03.647 --> 01:05.816
to ask her out.

01:05.816 --> 01:07.818
When women smile at me,

01:05.816 --> 01:07.818
I don't know what it means.

01:07.818 --> 01:09.611
Sometimes I interpret it

01:07.818 --> 01:09.611
like they're psychotic,

01:09.611 --> 01:11.864
and I don't know

01:09.611 --> 01:11.864
if I'm supposed to smile back,

01:11.864 --> 01:14.033
I don't know what to do,

01:11.864 --> 01:14.033
so I stood there like--

01:14.033 --> 01:15.242
Remember how Quayle looked

01:15.242 --> 01:16.535
when Bentsen gave him

01:15.242 --> 01:16.535
that Kennedy line?

01:16.535 --> 01:17.703
That's what I looked like.

01:17.703 --> 01:19.204
You didn't ask?

01:17.703 --> 01:19.204
No, I froze.

01:19.204 --> 01:20.664
Counter.

01:19.204 --> 01:20.664
Oh. Yeah.

01:20.664 --> 01:21.874
So wait, wait.

01:21.874 --> 01:23.333
Half-hour later,

01:21.874 --> 01:23.333
I'm back at the office,

01:23.333 --> 01:24.752
I tell Lloyd

01:23.333 --> 01:24.752
the whole story.

01:24.752 --> 01:26.754
He says, "So why don't

01:24.752 --> 01:26.754
you call her?"

01:26.754 --> 01:29.006
I says, "I can't."

01:26.754 --> 01:29.006
I couldn't do it right then.

01:29.006 --> 01:30.465
For me to ask a woman out,

01:30.465 --> 01:31.967
I've got to get

01:30.465 --> 01:31.967
into a mental state,

01:31.967 --> 01:33.844
like the karate guys

01:31.967 --> 01:33.844
before they break the bricks.

01:33.844 --> 01:37.138
So then, Lloyd

01:33.844 --> 01:37.138
calls me a wuss.

01:37.138 --> 01:38.766
He said "wuss"?

01:38.766 --> 01:41.184
Yeah. Anyway, he

01:38.766 --> 01:41.184
shamed me into it.

01:41.184 --> 01:42.143
So you called?

01:42.143 --> 01:43.687
Right.

01:43.687 --> 01:45.689
And to cover my nervousness,

01:43.687 --> 01:45.689
I started eating an apple,

01:45.689 --> 01:47.274
because I think

01:45.689 --> 01:47.274
if they hear you chewing

01:47.274 --> 01:48.567
on the other end of the phone,

01:48.567 --> 01:49.777
it makes you sound casual.

01:49.777 --> 01:51.528
Yeah, like a farm boy.

01:51.528 --> 01:53.572
Right. So, I call her up,

01:51.528 --> 01:53.572
I tell her it's me.

01:53.572 --> 01:55.282
She gives me

01:53.572 --> 01:55.282
an enthusiastic "Hi."

01:55.282 --> 01:57.117
Oh. Enthusiastic hi,

01:55.282 --> 01:57.117
that's beautiful.

01:57.117 --> 01:59.244
I don't get the enthusiastic

01:57.117 --> 01:59.244
hi, I'm out of there.

01:59.244 --> 02:00.746
All right,

01:59.244 --> 02:00.746
so you're chewing your apple,

02:00.746 --> 02:02.081
you got your enthusiastic hi,

02:00.746 --> 02:02.081
go ahead.

02:02.081 --> 02:03.665
So, we're talking,

02:03.665 --> 02:05.960
and I don't like to go too long

02:03.665 --> 02:05.960
before I ask them out.

02:05.960 --> 02:07.920
I want to get it over with

02:05.960 --> 02:07.920
right away,

02:07.920 --> 02:09.463
so I just blurt out,

02:09.463 --> 02:11.131
"What are you doing

02:09.463 --> 02:11.131
Saturday night?"

02:11.131 --> 02:12.173
And?

02:13.050 --> 02:15.552
She bought.

02:15.552 --> 02:17.387
Great day in the morning.

02:17.387 --> 02:19.431
Then I got off the phone

02:17.387 --> 02:19.431
right away.

02:19.431 --> 02:20.808
Sure, it's like

02:19.431 --> 02:20.808
robbing a bank.

02:20.808 --> 02:22.559
You don't loiter around

02:20.808 --> 02:22.559
in front of the teller

02:22.559 --> 02:24.561
holding that big bag of money.

02:24.561 --> 02:25.980
You make your hit

02:24.561 --> 02:25.980
and get out.

02:25.980 --> 02:27.188
It's amazing.

02:27.188 --> 02:28.649
We both have dates

02:27.188 --> 02:28.649
the same night.

02:28.649 --> 02:30.067
I can't remember

02:28.649 --> 02:30.067
the last time that happened.

02:33.236 --> 02:35.322
I can't stand

02:33.236 --> 02:35.322
doing laundry.

02:35.322 --> 02:37.157
That's why I have

02:35.322 --> 02:37.157
40 pairs of underwear.

02:37.157 --> 02:39.493
You do not.

02:37.157 --> 02:39.493
Absolutely,

02:39.493 --> 02:42.746
because instead of doing a wash,

02:39.493 --> 02:42.746
I just keep buying underwear.

02:42.746 --> 02:44.581
My goal is to have

02:42.746 --> 02:44.581
over 360 pair.

02:44.581 --> 02:46.834
That way, I only have

02:44.581 --> 02:46.834
to do wash once a year.

02:50.129 --> 02:52.464
[SCOTTISH ACCENT]:

02:50.129 --> 02:52.464
Come on, try it.

02:52.464 --> 02:54.466
Let me hear you try

02:52.464 --> 02:54.466
a Scottish accent.

02:54.466 --> 02:56.175
That's Irish.

02:56.175 --> 02:58.929
Irish, Scottish,

02:56.175 --> 02:58.929
what's the difference, lassie?

03:01.890 --> 03:04.518
So, uh, thanks for dinner.

03:01.890 --> 03:04.518
It was great.

03:04.518 --> 03:05.769
Yeah.

03:07.855 --> 03:09.397
We should do this again.

03:09.397 --> 03:12.818
Would you like to come upstairs

03:09.397 --> 03:12.818
for some coffee?

03:12.818 --> 03:13.902
Oh, no, thanks.

03:13.902 --> 03:15.570
I can't drink coffee

03:13.902 --> 03:15.570
late at night.

03:15.570 --> 03:17.156
I keeps me up.

03:19.158 --> 03:22.410
Oh. So, um...

03:22.410 --> 03:23.537
Okay.

03:25.122 --> 03:26.999
Okay.

03:26.999 --> 03:28.416
Good night.

03:28.416 --> 03:30.878
Yeah, take it easy.

03:41.304 --> 03:42.806
Thanks again

03:41.304 --> 03:42.806
for the movie.

03:42.806 --> 03:44.265
You're welcome.

03:44.265 --> 03:48.020
I'd invite you up,

03:44.265 --> 03:48.020
but the place is being painted.

03:48.020 --> 03:49.646
Oh, that's okay.

03:49.646 --> 03:51.773
Unless you want to go

03:49.646 --> 03:51.773
to your place.

03:51.773 --> 03:55.443
Okay, but there's

03:51.773 --> 03:55.443
no cake or anything,

03:55.443 --> 03:56.945
if that's what

03:55.443 --> 03:56.945
you're looking for.

03:58.072 --> 03:59.656
Take it easy...

03:59.656 --> 04:01.282
[WHEEZING LAUGH]

04:01.282 --> 04:02.826
Take it easy!

04:05.204 --> 04:08.123
I think if one's

04:05.204 --> 04:08.123
going to kill oneself,

04:08.123 --> 04:10.333
the least you could do

04:08.123 --> 04:10.333
is leave a note.

04:10.333 --> 04:11.668
It's common courtesy.

04:11.668 --> 04:13.087
I don't know...

04:13.087 --> 04:15.380
that's just the way

04:13.087 --> 04:15.380
I was brought up.

04:16.631 --> 04:18.341
Values are important.

04:18.341 --> 04:20.219
Oh, so important.

04:21.469 --> 04:23.055
So, what are you doing

04:21.469 --> 04:23.055
Thursday night?

04:23.055 --> 04:24.139
You want to have dinner?

04:24.139 --> 04:26.516
Thursday's great.

04:30.020 --> 04:32.439
Tan pants.

04:32.439 --> 04:35.316
Why do I buy

04:32.439 --> 04:35.316
tan pants, Donna?

04:35.316 --> 04:36.985
I don't feel

04:35.316 --> 04:36.985
comfortable in them.

04:36.985 --> 04:38.779
Are those cotton Dockers?

04:38.779 --> 04:42.199
Oh, I can't begin

04:38.779 --> 04:42.199
to tell you

04:42.199 --> 04:43.825
how much I hate

04:42.199 --> 04:43.825
that commercial.

04:43.825 --> 04:44.826
Really?

04:44.826 --> 04:48.371
I like that commercial.

04:52.333 --> 04:53.919
You like that commercial?

04:53.919 --> 04:56.630
Yeah, it's clever.

04:56.630 --> 04:58.339
Now, wait a second.

04:58.339 --> 05:01.051
You mean the one where the guys

04:58.339 --> 05:01.051
are all standing around,

05:01.051 --> 05:03.053
supposedly being

05:01.051 --> 05:03.053
very casual and witty?

05:03.053 --> 05:04.554
Yeah, that's the one.

05:06.890 --> 05:09.935
What could you possibly like

05:06.890 --> 05:09.935
about that?

05:09.935 --> 05:12.353
I don't know.

05:09.935 --> 05:12.353
I like the guys.

05:12.353 --> 05:13.605
Yeah, they're so funny

05:13.605 --> 05:15.149
and so comfortable

05:13.605 --> 05:15.149
with each other,

05:15.149 --> 05:16.399
and I could be

05:15.149 --> 05:16.399
comfortable too,

05:16.399 --> 05:19.027
if I had pants like that.

05:19.027 --> 05:21.155
I could sit on a porch

05:19.027 --> 05:21.155
and wrestle around

05:21.155 --> 05:24.407
and maybe even be part

05:21.155 --> 05:24.407
of a real bull session.

05:24.407 --> 05:25.993
Hey, I know guys

05:24.407 --> 05:25.993
like that.

05:25.993 --> 05:28.120
To me, the dialogue

05:25.993 --> 05:28.120
rings true.

05:31.915 --> 05:34.375
Even if the dialogue

05:31.915 --> 05:34.375
did ring true...

05:34.375 --> 05:38.755
Even if somehow, somewhere,

05:34.375 --> 05:38.755
men actually talked like that,

05:38.755 --> 05:42.217
what does that have

05:38.755 --> 05:42.217
anything to do with the pants?

05:42.217 --> 05:44.343
Doesn't that bother you?

05:44.343 --> 05:46.096
That's the idea.

05:46.096 --> 05:47.639
That is what is clever about it,

05:47.639 --> 05:49.057
that they're not talking

05:47.639 --> 05:49.057
about the pants.

05:49.057 --> 05:50.558
But they're talking

05:49.057 --> 05:50.558
about nothing!

05:50.558 --> 05:52.686
That's the point!

05:50.558 --> 05:52.686
I know the point!

05:52.686 --> 05:54.604
No one is telling you

05:52.686 --> 05:54.604
to like it.

05:54.604 --> 05:56.315
I mean, all those quick shots

05:54.604 --> 05:56.315
of the pants.

05:56.315 --> 05:57.607
Just pants, pants, pants,

05:57.607 --> 05:59.151
pants, pants, pants.

05:59.151 --> 06:01.778
What is that

05:59.151 --> 06:01.778
supposed to be?

06:03.322 --> 06:04.572
[SIGHS]

06:06.867 --> 06:08.910
What's brutal about the date

06:08.910 --> 06:11.746
is the scrutiny

06:08.910 --> 06:11.746
that you put each other through,

06:11.746 --> 06:14.875
because whenever you think

06:11.746 --> 06:14.875
about this person

06:14.875 --> 06:16.293
in terms of the future,

06:16.293 --> 06:18.795
you have to magnify

06:16.293 --> 06:18.795
everything about them.

06:18.795 --> 06:20.214
You know, like,

06:18.795 --> 06:20.214
the guy will be, like,

06:20.214 --> 06:24.718
"I don't think

06:20.214 --> 06:24.718
her eyebrows are even.

06:24.718 --> 06:28.596
Could I look at uneven eyebrows

06:24.718 --> 06:28.596
for the rest of my life?"

06:28.596 --> 06:30.473
And, of course,

06:30.473 --> 06:32.100
the woman's looking at the guy

06:30.473 --> 06:32.100
thinking,

06:32.100 --> 06:33.852
"What is he looking at?

06:33.852 --> 06:35.354
"Do I want someone

06:35.354 --> 06:37.689
looking at me like this

06:35.354 --> 06:37.689
for the rest of my life?"

06:39.691 --> 06:42.277
I'm supposed to see her

06:39.691 --> 06:42.277
again on Thursday,

06:42.277 --> 06:43.695
but can I go out with someone

06:43.695 --> 06:46.114
that actually likes

06:43.695 --> 06:46.114
this commercial?

06:46.114 --> 06:48.075
I once broke up with a guy

06:48.075 --> 06:50.244
because he didn't

06:48.075 --> 06:50.244
keep his bathroom clean enough.

06:50.244 --> 06:51.452
No kidding?

06:51.452 --> 06:52.913
Did you tell him

06:51.452 --> 06:52.913
that was the reason?

06:52.913 --> 06:54.539
Oh yeah,

06:52.913 --> 06:54.539
I told him all the time.

06:54.539 --> 06:56.958
You would not

06:54.539 --> 06:56.958
have believed his tub.

06:56.958 --> 07:00.461
Germs were building

06:56.958 --> 07:00.461
a town in there.

07:00.461 --> 07:02.214
They were constructing offices.

07:02.214 --> 07:05.175
Houses near the drain

07:02.214 --> 07:05.175
were going for $150,000.

07:08.636 --> 07:09.679
Hi.

07:13.934 --> 07:16.019
You're still

07:13.934 --> 07:16.019
thinking about this?

07:17.771 --> 07:20.857
She invites me up

07:17.771 --> 07:20.857
at 12:00 at night

07:20.857 --> 07:23.193
for coffee.

07:23.193 --> 07:25.779
And I don't go up.

07:25.779 --> 07:30.617
"No thank you,

07:25.779 --> 07:30.617
I don't want coffee.

07:30.617 --> 07:32.619
"It keeps me up.

07:32.619 --> 07:36.164
Too late

07:32.619 --> 07:36.164
for me to drink coffee."

07:36.164 --> 07:38.499
I said this to her.

07:38.499 --> 07:41.502
People this stupid

07:38.499 --> 07:41.502
shouldn't be allowed to live.

07:41.502 --> 07:43.463
I can't imagine

07:41.502 --> 07:43.463
what she must think of me.

07:43.463 --> 07:45.840
She thinks you're a guy

07:43.463 --> 07:45.840
that doesn't like coffee.

07:45.840 --> 07:47.508
She invited me up!

07:47.508 --> 07:49.386
Coffee's not coffee!

07:47.508 --> 07:49.386
Coffee is sex.

07:49.386 --> 07:51.054
Maybe coffee was coffee.

07:51.054 --> 07:52.306
Coffee's coffee in the morning.

07:52.306 --> 07:53.848
It's not coffee

07:52.306 --> 07:53.848
at 12:00 at night.

07:53.848 --> 07:55.642
Well, some people

07:53.848 --> 07:55.642
drink coffee that late.

07:55.642 --> 07:57.769
Yeah, people who work at NORAD

07:57.769 --> 08:00.981
who are on

07:57.769 --> 08:00.981
24-hour missile watch!

08:00.981 --> 08:03.524
Everything was

08:00.981 --> 08:03.524
going along so great.

08:03.524 --> 08:05.777
She was laughing,

08:03.524 --> 08:05.777
I was funny.

08:05.777 --> 08:07.528
I kept saying to myself,

08:07.528 --> 08:09.990
"Keep it up. Don't blow it.

08:07.528 --> 08:09.990
You're doing great."

08:09.990 --> 08:11.325
It's all in your head.

08:11.325 --> 08:13.076
All she knows is

08:11.325 --> 08:13.076
she had a good time.

08:13.076 --> 08:14.328
I think you

08:13.076 --> 08:14.328
should call her.

08:14.328 --> 08:16.371
I can't call her now.

08:14.328 --> 08:16.371
It's too soon.

08:16.371 --> 08:18.206
I'm planning

08:16.371 --> 08:18.206
a Wednesday call.

08:18.206 --> 08:19.540
Why?

08:19.540 --> 08:21.460
I love it when guys

08:19.540 --> 08:21.460
call me the next day.

08:21.460 --> 08:22.752
Of course you do,

08:22.752 --> 08:24.296
but you're imagining

08:22.752 --> 08:24.296
a guy you like,

08:24.296 --> 08:25.880
not a guy who goes,

08:25.880 --> 08:29.384
"Uh, no, I don't drink coffee

08:25.880 --> 08:29.384
late at night. Ha, ha, ha."

08:29.384 --> 08:31.678
If I call her now,

08:29.384 --> 08:31.678
she's gonna thing I'm too needy.

08:31.678 --> 08:33.263
Women don't want to see need.

08:33.263 --> 08:37.142
They want a take-charge guy.

08:33.263 --> 08:37.142
A colonel. A Kaiser. A czar.

08:37.142 --> 08:40.228
All she'll think

08:37.142 --> 08:40.228
is that you like her.

08:40.228 --> 08:42.689
That's exactly

08:40.228 --> 08:42.689
what I'm trying to avoid!

08:42.689 --> 08:44.524
She wants you to like her!

08:44.524 --> 08:46.360
Yes, she wants me

08:44.524 --> 08:46.360
to like her,

08:46.360 --> 08:47.652
if she likes me.

08:47.652 --> 08:49.821
But she doesn't like me.

08:49.821 --> 08:53.325
I don't know what your

08:49.821 --> 08:53.325
parents did to you.

08:54.617 --> 08:56.286
Hey.

08:56.286 --> 08:57.620
Hey! I just thought of

08:57.620 --> 08:59.164
a really funny thing

08:57.620 --> 08:59.164
for your act!

08:59.164 --> 09:01.166
All right, you're up there,

08:59.164 --> 09:01.166
you're on your stage,

09:01.166 --> 09:02.792
and you go,

09:02.792 --> 09:05.753
"Hey, did you ever notice

09:02.792 --> 09:05.753
how cars here in New York,

09:05.753 --> 09:08.006
"they never get out of the way

09:05.753 --> 09:08.006
of ambulances anymore?

09:08.006 --> 09:11.218
"Someone's in a life

09:08.006 --> 09:11.218
and death situation,

09:11.218 --> 09:12.802
"and we're thinking,

09:12.802 --> 09:14.513
"'Well, sorry, buddy,

09:12.802 --> 09:14.513
you should've thought of that

09:14.513 --> 09:16.056
"'when you were eating

09:16.056 --> 09:18.225
"'cheese omelets and sausages

09:16.056 --> 09:18.225
for breakfast

09:18.225 --> 09:20.185
every morning

09:18.225 --> 09:20.185
for the last 30 years.'"

09:21.561 --> 09:23.146
So you gonna

09:21.561 --> 09:23.146
use it?

09:23.146 --> 09:24.481
I don't think so.

09:24.481 --> 09:26.274
What? It's funny.

09:26.274 --> 09:27.984
It's funny.

09:27.984 --> 09:29.610
I like to do my own material.

09:29.610 --> 09:31.946
That's as good

09:29.610 --> 09:31.946
as anything you do.

09:34.074 --> 09:37.118
All right, I gotta make a call.

09:34.074 --> 09:37.118
Everybody out, come on.

09:37.118 --> 09:38.161
Why do we have to leave?

09:38.161 --> 09:39.454
Because I can't

09:38.161 --> 09:39.454
call a woman

09:39.454 --> 09:40.872
with other people

09:39.454 --> 09:40.872
in the room.

09:40.872 --> 09:42.123
Come on, let's go.

09:42.123 --> 09:43.708
Oh, see.

09:42.123 --> 09:43.708
This is the problem.

09:43.708 --> 09:45.085
You're kicking me

09:43.708 --> 09:45.085
out of my house?

09:45.085 --> 09:47.128
Yes.

09:45.085 --> 09:47.128
Don't forget.

09:47.128 --> 09:48.338
Right.

09:48.338 --> 09:50.340
Oh, Jerry,

09:48.338 --> 09:50.340
do you have any apples?

09:51.883 --> 09:53.676
Don't do the apples.

09:53.676 --> 09:55.345
It's enough already

09:53.676 --> 09:55.345
with the apples.

10:11.903 --> 10:14.072
CAROL'S VOICE:

10:11.903 --> 10:14.072
<i>Hi, it's Carol.</i>

10:11.903 --> 10:14.072
<i>I'll get back to you.</i>

10:14.072 --> 10:15.282
<i>[BEEPS]</i>

10:15.282 --> 10:16.991
Umm...hi.

10:16.991 --> 10:18.452
It's, uh, George.

10:18.452 --> 10:20.328
George Costanza. Remember me?

10:20.328 --> 10:22.997
The guy that didn't

10:20.328 --> 10:22.997
come up for coffee.

10:22.997 --> 10:25.666
You see, I didn't realize

10:25.666 --> 10:30.046
that coffee

10:25.666 --> 10:30.046
didn't really mean...

10:30.046 --> 10:32.006
Well, whatever.

10:32.006 --> 10:35.594
Anyway, it was fun.

10:35.594 --> 10:38.305
It was, um...

10:38.305 --> 10:39.931
It was fun.

10:39.931 --> 10:45.228
So, oh boy, um, so...

10:39.931 --> 10:45.228
you call me back...

10:45.228 --> 10:47.688
You know,

10:45.228 --> 10:47.688
i-i-if you want.

10:47.688 --> 10:52.319
That's up to you, you know.

10:47.688 --> 10:52.319
Whatever you want to do.

10:52.319 --> 10:57.407
Either way.

10:52.319 --> 10:57.407
The ball's in your court.

10:57.407 --> 11:01.202
So, uh...take it easy.

11:03.663 --> 11:05.165
JERRY: I'm just going

11:03.663 --> 11:05.165
to get my jacket.

11:05.165 --> 11:06.458
I'll meet you downstairs.

11:06.458 --> 11:07.875
What's the matter?

11:07.875 --> 11:10.044
Did you call?

11:10.044 --> 11:11.671
Got her machine.

11:11.671 --> 11:14.341
I'm dead. I'm a dead man.

11:11.671 --> 11:14.341
That's it, I'm dead.

11:14.341 --> 11:16.092
I'm a dead man. Dead man.

11:16.092 --> 11:17.218
What did you say?

11:17.218 --> 11:18.845
I don't know

11:17.218 --> 11:18.845
what the hell I said.

11:18.845 --> 11:21.097
I gave her an ultimatum,

11:18.845 --> 11:21.097
and there's nothing I can do.

11:21.097 --> 11:22.307
It's a machine!

11:22.307 --> 11:23.975
The little light

11:22.307 --> 11:23.975
is blinking right now.

11:23.975 --> 11:25.726
"Come and listen to the idiot!

11:25.726 --> 11:29.147
Hey, everybody! The idiot's on!"

11:29.147 --> 11:31.525
After one date, you try

11:29.147 --> 11:31.525
and improvise on a machine?

11:31.525 --> 11:33.527
Now I'm in

11:31.525 --> 11:33.527
the worst position of all.

11:33.527 --> 11:36.070
You know, my brother-in-law

11:36.070 --> 11:38.365
once left a message

11:36.070 --> 11:38.365
on this guy's machine,

11:38.365 --> 11:40.241
and he blurted out

11:38.365 --> 11:40.241
some business information

11:40.241 --> 11:41.451
he wasn't supposed to,

11:41.451 --> 11:43.786
and it would've cost him

11:41.451 --> 11:43.786
$15,000,

11:43.786 --> 11:45.997
so he waited

11:43.786 --> 11:45.997
outside the guy's house,

11:45.997 --> 11:47.374
and when the guy came home,

11:47.374 --> 11:49.125
he went upstairs with him

11:47.374 --> 11:49.125
and switched the tape.

11:49.125 --> 11:50.377
Hmm.

11:50.377 --> 11:51.586
He did that?

11:51.586 --> 11:52.629
Yeah.

11:52.629 --> 11:53.963
Somebody did that?

11:53.963 --> 11:56.257
She'll call you back.

11:53.963 --> 11:56.257
You're overreacting.

12:03.348 --> 12:05.892
Not once.

12:03.348 --> 12:05.892
Never?

12:05.892 --> 12:10.271
I have never seen one episode

12:05.892 --> 12:10.271
of<i> I Love Lucy</i> in my life.

12:10.271 --> 12:11.314
Ever.

12:11.314 --> 12:12.273
That's amazing.

12:12.273 --> 12:13.650
Thank you.

12:13.650 --> 12:15.860
Is there anything else about you

12:13.650 --> 12:15.860
I should know?

12:15.860 --> 12:18.446
Yes, I'm lactose intolerant.

12:18.446 --> 12:20.031
Really?

12:20.031 --> 12:23.201
I have no patience

12:20.031 --> 12:23.201
for lactose...

12:23.201 --> 12:25.286
and I won't stand for it.

12:25.286 --> 12:26.787
Um, I'll be right back.

12:33.169 --> 12:34.462
Wait till you hear this!

12:34.462 --> 12:36.715
Whoa, uh...I'm sorry.

12:36.715 --> 12:38.091
I didn't-- I had no idea.

12:38.091 --> 12:39.842
Wait, wait.

12:38.091 --> 12:39.842
He's in the bathroom.

12:39.842 --> 12:41.219
Oh.

12:41.219 --> 12:43.430
Well, I just wanted

12:41.219 --> 12:43.430
to talk to him for a minute,

12:43.430 --> 12:44.431
but I'll come back.

12:44.431 --> 12:45.515
You don't have to leave.

12:45.515 --> 12:46.516
You sure?

12:46.516 --> 12:47.517
Yes.

12:47.517 --> 12:49.352
Okay.

12:49.352 --> 12:50.395
I'm Donna.

12:50.395 --> 12:51.770
Donna.

12:51.770 --> 12:53.565
Oh, you're the one

12:51.770 --> 12:53.565
that likes that commercial.

12:54.899 --> 12:56.359
He told you that?

12:57.569 --> 13:01.197
No, he didn't actually

12:57.569 --> 13:01.197
tell me that.

13:01.197 --> 13:03.283
We were talking

13:01.197 --> 13:03.283
about that commercial.

13:03.283 --> 13:05.326
In fact,

13:03.283 --> 13:05.326
I think I brought it up,

13:05.326 --> 13:07.954
because I like that commercial.

13:07.954 --> 13:10.624
No, he would never actually

13:07.954 --> 13:10.624
tell me anything like that.

13:10.624 --> 13:14.168
He never discusses anything.

13:10.624 --> 13:14.168
He's-- He's like a clam.

13:14.168 --> 13:17.046
You're not gonna

13:14.168 --> 13:17.046
mention this to him...

13:17.046 --> 13:19.382
So you go around telling

13:17.046 --> 13:19.382
your friends I'm not hip

13:19.382 --> 13:20.759
because I like

13:19.382 --> 13:20.759
that commercial.

13:20.759 --> 13:22.885
What? What did you say?

13:22.885 --> 13:24.262
Say? What? Nothing.

13:22.885 --> 13:24.262
I didn't...

13:24.262 --> 13:26.805
You told him

13:24.262 --> 13:26.805
how I like the commercial.

13:26.805 --> 13:28.349
Well, so what if I said that?

13:28.349 --> 13:30.310
Well, so you didn't have

13:28.349 --> 13:30.310
to tell your friends.

13:30.310 --> 13:32.145
No, I had to tell my friends.

13:32.145 --> 13:33.812
My friends

19:50.648 --> 19:52.984
Well, let me just check

19:50.648 --> 19:52.984
my messages, and we'll go.

19:52.984 --> 19:55.111
Uh, Carol, could I talk to you

19:52.984 --> 19:55.111
for a second?

19:55.111 --> 19:56.529
Right now.

19:55.111 --> 19:56.529
Sure.

19:56.529 --> 19:59.115
Please. This is--

19:56.529 --> 19:59.115
This is very important.

20:06.122 --> 20:09.249
GEORGE:

20:06.122 --> 20:09.249
Tippy toe! Tippy toe!

20:06.122 --> 20:09.249
Uh, lemon tree!

20:09.249 --> 20:10.626
Now I know

20:09.249 --> 20:10.626
who you are!

20:10.626 --> 20:12.336
You're a comedian.

20:10.626 --> 20:12.336
I've seen you.

20:12.336 --> 20:13.629
It's been

20:12.336 --> 20:13.629
driving me crazy!

20:13.629 --> 20:15.422
Right. I am.

20:15.422 --> 20:19.135
Carol, that's so rude.

20:19.135 --> 20:21.846
Please, I'm serious,

20:19.135 --> 20:21.846
just for a moment,

20:21.846 --> 20:24.348
if you wouldn't mind,

20:21.846 --> 20:24.348
and then we'll talk to Jerry.

20:36.485 --> 20:39.989
Hey, you two,

20:36.485 --> 20:39.989
I'm ready to go.

20:39.989 --> 20:41.490
That's what you

20:39.989 --> 20:41.490
had to tell me?

20:41.490 --> 20:43.659
Your father

20:41.490 --> 20:43.659
wears sneakers in the pool?

20:47.080 --> 20:48.581
Don't you find that

20:47.080 --> 20:48.581
strange?

20:48.581 --> 20:50.750
Yes.

20:52.126 --> 20:54.587
Well, I'll just check my machine

20:52.126 --> 20:54.587
and we'll go.

20:57.924 --> 20:59.967
Nope, nothing here. Let's go.

20:59.967 --> 21:01.510
Oh, I forgot to tell you.

21:01.510 --> 21:03.345
After I talked to you today,

21:01.510 --> 21:03.345
my neighbor called me

21:03.345 --> 21:05.389
and played my messages

21:03.345 --> 21:05.389
for me over the phone.

21:06.432 --> 21:07.892
Oh, I...

21:07.892 --> 21:10.519
Yours were hilarious!

21:07.892 --> 21:10.519
We were both cracking up.

21:10.519 --> 21:12.271
I just love jokes like that.

21:21.321 --> 21:24.742
I love my phone machine.

21:24.742 --> 21:27.494
I wish I was a phone machine.

21:27.494 --> 21:29.288
I wish if I saw somebody

21:27.494 --> 21:29.288
on the street

21:29.288 --> 21:30.706
I didn't want to talk to,

21:30.706 --> 21:35.628
I could go, "Excuse me,

21:30.706 --> 21:35.628
I'm not in right now.

21:35.628 --> 21:37.504
"If you could just

21:35.628 --> 21:37.504
leave a message,

21:37.504 --> 21:39.006
I could walk away."

21:40.758 --> 21:45.221
I also have a cordless phone,

21:40.758 --> 21:45.221
but I don't like that as much,

21:45.221 --> 21:47.514
because you can't slam down

21:45.221 --> 21:47.514
a cordless phone.

21:47.514 --> 21:50.268
You get mad at somebody

21:47.514 --> 21:50.268
on a real phone,

21:50.268 --> 21:52.812
"You can't talk to me

21:50.268 --> 21:52.812
like that!" Bang! You know.

21:52.812 --> 21:54.647
Cordless phone,

21:54.647 --> 21:57.650
"You can't talk to me

21:54.647 --> 21:57.650
like that..."

22:02.571 --> 22:04.657
I told him.

22:15.918 --> 22:19.505
[♪♪♪]
