00:15.862 --> 00:19.448
<i>My name is April Jane,
and I am in my 50s.</i>

00:19.448 --> 00:22.724
I'm a vintage, rare find.

00:24.689 --> 00:27.172
<i>I live in Studio City, California,</i>

00:27.172 --> 00:31.448
<i>and I have three
amazing boys.</i>

00:31.448 --> 00:33.310
<i>I don't think
any of my sons realize</i>

00:33.310 --> 00:35.689
that I have
an extremely high libido.

00:35.689 --> 00:37.034
<i>Hold on.</i>

00:37.034 --> 00:38.172
Is that too much saying

00:38.172 --> 00:39.517
I have an extremely
high libido?

00:39.517 --> 00:41.379
Should I just have said
high libido?

00:44.000 --> 00:46.827
<i>My marriage was wonderful
for a while.</i>

00:46.827 --> 00:48.517
We got together
when we were very young.

00:48.517 --> 00:50.344
I am seven years
older than him.

00:50.344 --> 00:51.620
<i>We just realized that</i>

00:51.620 --> 00:54.793
<i>we weren't completely compatible.</i>

00:54.793 --> 00:56.482
<i>I thought I had
my whole life planned,</i>

00:56.482 --> 00:59.379
but now I'm here,
open to the adventure.

00:59.379 --> 01:01.103
<i>I'm open to having
a connection</i>

01:01.103 --> 01:02.620
<i>with another younger man.</i>

01:02.620 --> 01:05.034
I hope I'm really gonna
find love.

01:09.551 --> 01:10.724
<i>My name is Pola.</i>

01:10.724 --> 01:12.689
I am originally
from Mexico City,

01:12.689 --> 01:15.241
but right now I live in Miami,
in a paradise.

01:15.241 --> 01:16.896
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:16.896 --> 01:18.413
- How are you?
- I'm good.

01:18.413 --> 01:19.827
My name is Pola.
Nice to meet you.

01:19.827 --> 01:22.103
Hi, Pola.
Nice to meet you, too. April.

01:22.103 --> 01:23.689
April.
Nice to meet you. Pleasure.

01:23.689 --> 01:26.275
I'm expecting
for some guys to walk up

01:26.275 --> 01:27.586
and introduce themselves.

01:27.586 --> 01:30.413
And here comes Pola.

01:30.413 --> 01:31.586
And it surprised me.

01:31.586 --> 01:33.310
- Nice to meet you, Pola.
- Welcome to Mexico.

01:33.310 --> 01:34.448
Thank you.

01:34.448 --> 01:36.827
I'm not necessarily
a competitive person,

01:36.827 --> 01:38.724
but I'm confident,

01:38.724 --> 01:41.586
and she doesn't have
anything on me.

01:41.586 --> 01:43.413
- Where are you from?
- I'm from Los Angeles.

01:43.413 --> 01:45.206
- Oh, that's nice.
- Such pretty eyes.

01:45.206 --> 01:46.413
- You like Mexico?
- I love it.

01:46.413 --> 01:47.827
- It's beautiful, right?
- It's gorgeous.

01:47.827 --> 01:49.000
- Yes.
- It is gorgeous.

01:49.000 --> 01:51.103
When I was 23 years old,

01:51.103 --> 01:54.034
<i>my husband passed away
in a car accident.</i>

01:54.034 --> 01:55.758
<i>It was really hard,</i>

01:55.758 --> 01:58.344
<i>but I wanted a good life
for my kids,</i>

01:58.344 --> 02:01.620
so I decided I was gonna
live my life happily,

02:01.620 --> 02:03.482
make good memories
with my kids,

02:03.482 --> 02:05.344
and just move forward.

02:05.344 --> 02:07.172
- Salud.
- Salud.

02:08.448 --> 02:10.448
I'm totally ready
to take that risk

02:10.448 --> 02:11.862
and find that special guy.

02:13.172 --> 02:14.482
I'm that kind of woman

02:14.482 --> 02:16.344
that really likes
to be around a man.

02:16.344 --> 02:17.896
I've never been by myself.

02:17.896 --> 02:20.689
Like, in kindergarten,
I had boyfriends.

02:20.689 --> 02:23.827
Like, I've always been
around someone special.

02:23.827 --> 02:27.000
<i>So if someone proposed
while I'm here,</i>

02:27.000 --> 02:28.413
that would be great news.

02:28.413 --> 02:32.000
I don't know what...
if it's gonna happen or not,
but let's see.

02:32.000 --> 02:33.517
So what do you do in LA?

02:33.517 --> 02:34.586
- I'm a singer.
- Oh, really?

02:34.586 --> 02:35.862
Can I ask you your age?

02:37.000 --> 02:38.413
No, you can't. No.

02:39.620 --> 02:41.551
<i>My name is Soyoung.</i>

02:41.551 --> 02:43.689
<i>I am 50 years old.</i>

02:43.689 --> 02:46.517
When I meet good-looking,
my type of a man,

02:46.517 --> 02:48.000
I'll introduce myself and say,

02:48.000 --> 02:51.068
"Hey, I'm Soyoung
and I'm so [bleep]."

02:52.482 --> 02:53.827
- Hi.
- How are you?

02:53.827 --> 02:54.965
Hey! How are you?

02:54.965 --> 02:56.448
Good.
How are you?

02:56.448 --> 02:58.000
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

02:58.000 --> 02:59.172
I'm Soyoung.

02:59.172 --> 03:00.344
- Soyoung?
- Yes.

03:00.344 --> 03:02.551
I always dated a young guy.

03:02.551 --> 03:04.172
My second husband
was younger.

03:04.172 --> 03:05.758
<i>All my boyfriends was young.</i>

03:05.758 --> 03:08.482
<i>Always ten years younger.
I'm a fire love.</i>

03:08.482 --> 03:11.724
I have to have those fire,
love to have sex.

03:11.724 --> 03:14.689
If I don't have that,
I could have sex,

03:14.689 --> 03:18.172
but I can't kiss anybody
because that's disgusting.

03:18.172 --> 03:19.379
Where are you from?

03:19.379 --> 03:20.551
I'm originally
from South Korea.

03:20.551 --> 03:21.758
- Oh, are you?
- Yeah.

03:21.758 --> 03:23.172
- Oh, I love--
- Nice.

03:23.172 --> 03:24.724
How old were you
when you moved out?

03:24.724 --> 03:26.000
How many years ago
did you move to--

03:26.000 --> 03:29.551
That's when I was 19,
18 and a half. So yeah.

03:29.551 --> 03:32.034
- Adventurous.
- Yeah, I am.

03:32.034 --> 03:34.482
Like, I'm not afraid
of things, like anything.

03:34.482 --> 03:36.068
How about of this?

03:36.068 --> 03:37.551
Yes. Just like this.

03:38.793 --> 03:39.965
<i>Soyoung is cute.</i>

03:39.965 --> 03:41.310
I'm sure
she's gonna get picked

03:41.310 --> 03:42.758
with many other guys,

03:42.758 --> 03:46.137
<i>but if she likes
the same guy that I do like,</i>

03:46.137 --> 03:47.965
<i>I will be competitive. And...</i>

03:50.068 --> 03:51.724
I don't care about
any other thing.

03:51.724 --> 03:52.965
I want to win.

03:52.965 --> 03:54.137
We're gonna start the day.

03:54.137 --> 03:55.241
- Nice meeting you.
- Yay!

03:55.241 --> 03:56.655
- Nice to meet you.
- Woo-hoo!

03:58.034 --> 03:59.689
<i>My name is April.
I'm 43 years old.</i>

03:59.689 --> 04:01.103
<i>I'm from Detroit, Michigan.</i>

04:01.103 --> 04:03.137
I'm a very simple girl.

04:03.137 --> 04:04.931
I married
my high school sweetheart.

04:04.931 --> 04:06.620
I met him at 14.

04:06.620 --> 04:08.310
<i>We had our children together</i>

04:08.310 --> 04:10.551
<i>and we were married
for 14 years.</i>

04:10.551 --> 04:13.793
So that has been my really
longest relationship.

04:13.793 --> 04:14.931
- Hi!
- Hola.

04:14.931 --> 04:16.379
You guys look so pretty.

04:16.379 --> 04:19.724
- I'm April.
- April, I'm April.

04:19.724 --> 04:21.241
There's two Aprils.

04:21.241 --> 04:22.413
Right.

04:22.413 --> 04:24.896
I gave a lot of my youth
to raising my boys.

04:24.896 --> 04:28.275
<i>Now, at 43, I'm just looking
to have fun.</i>

04:28.275 --> 04:30.620
And I want
to date younger men

04:30.620 --> 04:32.896
because a lot of guys
that are older,

04:32.896 --> 04:34.655
they're like in "papa mode",

04:34.655 --> 04:36.724
and I want to get a chance
to do me a little.

04:36.724 --> 04:39.413
So when it's time for me
to be grandma, like I'm ready.

04:39.413 --> 04:40.655
I'm just not ready now.

04:45.655 --> 04:47.620
Ladies,
where's all the men at?

04:47.620 --> 04:49.620
Are you kidding me?
You guys look great.

04:49.620 --> 04:51.034
Hi.

04:51.034 --> 04:52.137
My name is Charlene.

04:52.137 --> 04:53.310
I'm from Jersey,

04:53.310 --> 04:56.275
but currently I live in
Los Angeles, Hollywood.

04:56.275 --> 04:58.068
- Hi.
- What did you say
your name was again?

04:58.068 --> 04:59.413
- Charlene.
- Charlene. Right.

04:59.413 --> 05:01.517
Yeah. I think it's my time
to find love.

05:01.517 --> 05:03.000
I really do.

05:03.000 --> 05:07.000
<i>Because life has,
you know, really given me
some curveballs,</i>

05:07.000 --> 05:09.896
and it took a long time
to get here.

05:09.896 --> 05:12.206
It's so nice to meet
new people, so, you know.

05:12.206 --> 05:14.068
So I'm wearing
two necklaces today.

05:14.068 --> 05:16.517
The first one
is an infinity necklace
that my daughter,

05:16.517 --> 05:18.620
Ashley, got for me.

05:18.620 --> 05:20.275
And she's my oldest daughter.

05:20.275 --> 05:22.689
She would be 28 right now.

05:22.689 --> 05:24.931
She just had her birthday,
but she passed away

05:24.931 --> 05:26.137
when she was 27.

05:27.379 --> 05:29.172
<i>So it's not even been
a year yet.</i>

05:30.379 --> 05:33.137
<i>Losing her was by far
the hardest thing</i>

05:33.137 --> 05:35.758
I've ever had to do,
and I'm doing it.

05:35.758 --> 05:37.275
That's the thing.
I'm doing it.

05:38.689 --> 05:42.137
My daughter was huge
in my life about dating.

05:42.137 --> 05:44.448
<i>She'd be the first person
I would talk to.</i>

05:44.448 --> 05:46.551
The first person I would ask.

05:46.551 --> 05:48.000
Are we looking for love,

05:48.000 --> 05:49.172
are we looking for romance?

05:49.172 --> 05:50.482
I'm looking for love?

05:50.482 --> 05:52.655
I mean, look, it's like
love is in the air here.

05:52.655 --> 05:54.448
- It's so...
- it's romantic.

05:54.448 --> 05:55.655
It is romantic.

05:55.655 --> 05:58.655
I am doing this for Ashley
in a lot of ways

05:58.655 --> 06:01.206
<i>because I think she wants me
to be happy.</i>

06:01.206 --> 06:02.655
I know she would want me
to be in love.

06:02.655 --> 06:03.827
Like, hey, that's the hope.

06:03.827 --> 06:04.965
Could I fall in love?

06:04.965 --> 06:07.758
Could I get married
and come out of the dark like,

06:07.758 --> 06:10.862
you know, a new chapter,
light on the horizon.

06:10.862 --> 06:12.896
But it's been so long,
I don't know.

06:12.896 --> 06:14.103
I never know how...

06:14.103 --> 06:15.724
how and why I'm gonna be
attracted to someone,

06:15.724 --> 06:17.344
like their personality
to me, it can be more--

06:17.344 --> 06:18.793
That's much more important.

06:18.793 --> 06:20.931
Sometimes,
like really good-looking guys,
they're so...

06:20.931 --> 06:22.896
They open their mouth...
- Yeah.

06:22.896 --> 06:24.758
- Yeah,
I was gonna say that.
- It's not...

06:24.758 --> 06:28.241
How about the guy
that are ugly and...
but he has a nice personality,

06:28.241 --> 06:29.517
nice to you,
you're gonna date?

06:29.517 --> 06:32.517
No,
no, no, no, no.

06:32.517 --> 06:36.827
I'm Kelle. I'm 50 years old,
and my alter ego
is Disco Mommy.

06:36.827 --> 06:38.551
Hey, girls!

06:38.551 --> 06:40.241
- Hey!
- Hello!

06:40.241 --> 06:42.517
How are you
hot ladies doing?

06:42.517 --> 06:45.551
<i>Disco Mommy loves house music
and Disco Mommy,</i>

06:45.551 --> 06:48.724
she's really spontaneous.
She's just fun.

06:48.724 --> 06:51.103
What can I get
you ladies to drink?

06:51.103 --> 06:52.586
Do we need a shot?

06:54.551 --> 06:56.275
Kelle has a big personality.

06:56.275 --> 06:57.862
Don't play with me.

06:57.862 --> 07:02.482
I do think that, for me,
it's really too much.

07:02.482 --> 07:04.620
She's just got to pare it back
just a little bit.

07:04.620 --> 07:06.620
One, two, three, four.

07:06.620 --> 07:10.758
All these women look amazingly
hot, but they're not me.

07:10.758 --> 07:12.344
Always good vibes.

07:12.344 --> 07:16.620
I have six amazing kids,
three girls and three boys,

07:16.620 --> 07:18.310
<i>and I feel like
I've been judged</i>

07:18.310 --> 07:21.586
by having multiple kids
from not having the same dad.

07:21.586 --> 07:24.551
In fact, that's
the number one question
people ask me, like...

07:24.551 --> 07:26.000
like, "From the same guy?"

07:26.000 --> 07:28.551
I'm like, "No, why would
I have six kids
from the same guy?

07:28.551 --> 07:29.758
Hello."

07:29.758 --> 07:31.068
You're a bad influence
already, girl.

07:31.068 --> 07:32.448
No, I'm an amazing influence
for sure.

07:32.448 --> 07:33.931
Yeah, you are.

07:33.931 --> 07:37.068
I think it's gonna be
a little bit hard to keep up
with Kelle.

07:37.068 --> 07:40.827
She's gonna be the party girl
in this house.

07:40.827 --> 07:42.275
- A good influence.
- To good influence.

07:42.275 --> 07:43.482
Cheers, ladies. Go.

07:43.482 --> 07:45.586
<i>Well, I used to think
that age was an issue</i>

07:45.586 --> 07:48.758
until the first guy I dated
out of my marriage, right?

07:48.758 --> 07:50.689
And he was like
14 years younger.

07:50.689 --> 07:52.620
And then it became like
kind of a theme

07:52.620 --> 07:56.344
that all these younger guys
I kept like hanging out
with and dating,

07:56.344 --> 07:58.931
and we literally had
the best time.

07:58.931 --> 08:01.034
And they taught me that,
you know,

08:01.034 --> 08:03.655
they could be drawn
to an older woman.

08:03.655 --> 08:06.551
<i>And then I realized
I can teach younger men
a lot of things.</i>

08:09.827 --> 08:11.689
I don't know if I can say
that on TV.

08:13.413 --> 08:14.793
Were you married before?

08:14.793 --> 08:16.758
I was married ten years.

08:16.758 --> 08:18.413
So how is dating
going for you now?

08:18.413 --> 08:20.034
Do younger guys gravitate
toward you?

08:20.034 --> 08:21.827
Yes.
Because you look so amazing.

08:21.827 --> 08:23.379
- Yes. Thank you.
- Yeah. Yeah.

08:23.379 --> 08:26.482
<i>Kelle is the most
risque of all the moms</i>

08:26.482 --> 08:28.413
with no shame whatsoever.

08:28.413 --> 08:30.275
I'm not mad about my body.

08:32.689 --> 08:36.896
I already feel
I'm the woman that will get
the least attention.

08:36.896 --> 08:39.241
<i>You could tell Kelle
has invested a lot of time</i>

08:39.241 --> 08:40.827
<i>into her body,
her sex appeal.</i>

08:40.827 --> 08:42.586
<i>And I know that
young men want that.</i>

08:42.586 --> 08:45.758
So she's got that
going for herself.

08:45.758 --> 08:47.758
I have the best trainer
in Orange County,

08:47.758 --> 08:50.137
- so if you guys want to come.
- Right.

08:50.137 --> 08:51.517
<i>Everyone's very pretty</i>

08:51.517 --> 08:53.379
<i>and I'm like
the biggest girl here.</i>

08:53.379 --> 08:55.241
Like, what do I have to offer?

08:55.241 --> 08:57.000
You know,
we're getting older, ladies.

08:57.000 --> 09:00.068
We're not getting younger,
even though we can think
that we can do things

09:00.068 --> 09:02.241
to make ourselves look
younger, we're really not.

09:02.241 --> 09:03.448
We're really not.

09:03.448 --> 09:05.103
<i>Marina Charlene is...</i>

09:05.103 --> 09:08.379
she probably was very hot
when she was younger,

09:08.379 --> 09:10.034
um, more in shape.

09:10.034 --> 09:12.620
<i>I just feel like
she doesn't know</i>

09:12.620 --> 09:14.379
how to glam herself up.

09:14.379 --> 09:17.137
I think she's just
a little worried about

09:17.137 --> 09:21.034
not being pleasing
in that way to the guys.

09:21.034 --> 09:22.551
I was asking them
what they do and then,

09:22.551 --> 09:24.310
now I'm thinking we should
try to guess what you--

09:24.310 --> 09:26.000
Just guess
what you do.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.379
- I feel like you do something
like with human resources.
- She's like corporate--

09:28.379 --> 09:30.758
- Yes, I was just
gonna say that.
- Yeah. Yeah, right?

09:30.758 --> 09:32.551
I plan corporate events
and meetings.

09:32.551 --> 09:34.068
- You're an event planner?
- Yes.

09:34.068 --> 09:35.206
<i>I enjoy my work.</i>

09:35.206 --> 09:37.068
I have had the opportunity
to travel the world,

09:37.068 --> 09:39.827
<i>but I wasn't always
a corporate events planner.</i>

09:39.827 --> 09:42.448
<i>I looked like the B-girl back
in the day
on the street corners</i>

09:42.448 --> 09:45.586
<i>doing the break dance
and then the pop and lock
and on the cardboard.</i>

09:45.586 --> 09:47.379
<i>So I like to have fun,
you know?</i>

09:47.379 --> 09:48.862
And I think
that most young men

09:48.862 --> 09:50.310
could probably
appreciate that,

09:50.310 --> 09:54.413
that I'm not stiff
and, you know,
or corny or prude.

09:54.413 --> 09:56.551
Have you guys been dating
during COVID?

09:56.551 --> 09:57.620
Have you been dating?

09:57.620 --> 09:59.482
- I haven't been.
- Not since.

09:59.482 --> 10:01.103
Well, I'm open,
you know,

10:01.103 --> 10:03.310
it's just
whatever God has, I guess.

10:03.310 --> 10:04.586
- Amen to that.
- Right?

10:04.586 --> 10:06.206
Whatever God's plan is.
It's actually really--

10:06.206 --> 10:07.758
It's probably
why we're all here right now.

10:07.758 --> 10:09.275
- Yes.
- Just seeing what's going on.

10:09.275 --> 10:10.448
Exactly.

10:10.448 --> 10:13.344
I've always been,
you know, a believer.

10:13.344 --> 10:17.655
<i>I love the Lord,
and I think it's important
with relationships.</i>

10:17.655 --> 10:21.896
I think your partner,
having God as the foundation
is very important.

10:21.896 --> 10:24.379
You know, I feel like
a lot of older guys

10:24.379 --> 10:26.827
don't want a commitment
because they're getting out
of a divorce.

10:26.827 --> 10:28.586
- That is so funny.
- I was thinking
the same thing.

10:28.586 --> 10:30.586
So they... they just want to
play the field a little bit.

10:30.586 --> 10:32.034
And you're like,
"Yeah, it's time for--"

10:32.034 --> 10:33.206
It's like, bro,
you're like 60.

10:33.206 --> 10:35.931
Yeah. And you look like
you're 80, like come on.

10:35.931 --> 10:37.724
And then you still want
to play the field?

10:37.724 --> 10:39.413
Like, go, bye.

10:39.413 --> 10:44.068
I am excited to see
what God has in store for me

10:44.068 --> 10:47.103
and we'll see what happens
on this amazing journey.

10:47.103 --> 10:48.551
I'm so thrilled.

10:48.551 --> 10:49.793
Wait, girls, hold on.

10:49.793 --> 10:51.862
- I got a text. It says...
- Oh, yeah?

10:51.862 --> 10:53.655
It says,
"Welcome to the villa.

10:53.655 --> 10:56.517
You're about to embark
on a dating experience
like none other."

10:56.517 --> 10:57.827
Oh!

10:57.827 --> 11:01.517
We all received phones so that
we could receive text messages

11:01.517 --> 11:03.655
telling us what we're gonna do
in the villa.

11:03.655 --> 11:06.517
<i>I'm a little excited,
but also nervous</i>

11:06.517 --> 11:09.034
because we have no idea
what to expect.

11:10.896 --> 11:12.931
"Please head to the house
where you will meet

11:12.931 --> 11:14.379
the new men in your life."

11:14.379 --> 11:16.655
Let's go.

11:16.655 --> 11:18.310
- Vamanos.
- All right.

11:18.310 --> 11:20.620
<i>I'm so excited to meet
with these guys</i>

11:20.620 --> 11:24.206
because I know that these guys
are going to be younger.

11:24.206 --> 11:26.517
<i>I have a very young,
free spirit,</i>

11:26.517 --> 11:29.965
and I connect to younger men,
especially in the bedroom.

11:32.896 --> 11:35.344
<i>All my life,
I've been looking for tall,</i>

11:35.344 --> 11:41.103
dark hair, blue eyes,
nice abs, thick thighs.

11:41.103 --> 11:42.689
<i>Hopefully he's here.</i>

11:42.689 --> 11:44.517
<i>If not there,
out there anyone,</i>

11:44.517 --> 11:46.689
please call me, Soyoung.

11:52.482 --> 11:55.172
<i>My special woman
has to be older,</i>

11:55.172 --> 11:58.689
<i>and I'm here in Paradise
hoping to find my soulmate.</i>

12:02.068 --> 12:04.000
<i>I am so excited
to come on this retreat</i>

12:04.000 --> 12:06.586
<i>and just meet
a ton of beautiful women</i>

12:06.586 --> 12:07.758
<i>that are mature</i>

12:07.758 --> 12:09.413
<i>and comfortable
with themselves.</i>

12:11.724 --> 12:14.206
<i>I love older women
that can keep up with me</i>

12:14.206 --> 12:15.862
<i>because I'm bringing
that young energy.</i>

12:15.862 --> 12:17.034
<i>I'm looking for love.</i>

12:17.034 --> 12:18.413
<i>I need a grown woman
out here.</i>

12:18.413 --> 12:19.896
<i>Let's go.</i>

12:19.896 --> 12:21.551
Here we go.
Here we go.

12:24.551 --> 12:26.655
- Whoa!
- Yeah!

12:26.655 --> 12:28.241
All right, now.

12:28.241 --> 12:29.448
Grrr.

12:29.448 --> 12:31.586
<i>So curious
as to what I can find here.</i>

12:31.586 --> 12:32.862
<i>I mean, this is it.</i>

12:32.862 --> 12:35.172
All of my moments
have led me to this one.

12:35.172 --> 12:37.689
And hopefully
there is somebody here

12:37.689 --> 12:39.862
that is gonna be
interested in me.

12:39.862 --> 12:41.206
I could be
interested in them.

12:44.793 --> 12:46.241
What's going on?

12:46.241 --> 12:47.931
Wait. They're our moms?

12:47.931 --> 12:49.448
Holy [bleep].

13:00.172 --> 13:01.586
Whoo!

13:03.137 --> 13:04.482
That's my mom right there.

13:08.965 --> 13:10.103
Oh, my God!

13:10.103 --> 13:12.620
I just saw straight
to Jose's eyes

13:12.620 --> 13:17.068
and just stayed there
for a couple of seconds
and say, "What is this?"

13:18.758 --> 13:20.379
I am really confused
right now.

13:20.379 --> 13:22.103
What is really happening here?

13:25.241 --> 13:26.793
I'm, like,
completely shocked.

13:26.793 --> 13:29.517
I see my son
back there and it's like,

13:29.517 --> 13:30.931
"Who are all these guys?"

13:32.655 --> 13:34.482
<i>So</i>[bleep] <i>cool.</i>

13:34.482 --> 13:36.758
We're supposed to date
the other moms?

13:36.758 --> 13:37.965
Uh...

13:37.965 --> 13:39.482
And you're here.
That's so weird.

13:39.482 --> 13:41.137
- Yeah.
- That is so weird.

13:44.137 --> 13:45.448
<i>I knew my son Gabriel</i>

13:45.448 --> 13:47.000
<i>was going to be
in Mexico with me.</i>

13:47.000 --> 13:49.586
I thought he was gonna be
on a separate dating retreat,

13:49.586 --> 13:51.965
<i>but he's in my dating pool.</i>

13:51.965 --> 13:55.103
And I'm gonna have to see
my son date these moms.

13:55.103 --> 13:56.620
This is crazy, bro.

13:59.689 --> 14:04.379
I'm feeling very overwhelmed
and a little scared.

14:04.379 --> 14:06.551
<i>Seeing my son standing
in that line</i>

14:06.551 --> 14:09.655
<i>made me feel very awkward
because they're my son's age.</i>

14:09.655 --> 14:12.689
We're up. Let's go. We're up.

14:12.689 --> 14:15.482
I was a little shocked
to see Ryan in the pool.

14:15.482 --> 14:17.000
<i>I didn't see that
coming at all.</i>

14:17.000 --> 14:18.206
<i>I'm gonna be honest.</i>

14:18.206 --> 14:19.551
<i>I'm thinking first pick
in the draft.</i>

14:19.551 --> 14:21.965
Like, I'm looking at
everything else before my mom.

14:21.965 --> 14:23.206
Thank God for that.

14:24.551 --> 14:25.827
Hi, Mom.
How are you doing?

14:25.827 --> 14:27.965
Hey.
What are you doing here?

14:27.965 --> 14:30.206
Why are you following me
on the retreat, Joey?

14:30.206 --> 14:32.310
I'm here to find love.
Don't get in my way.

14:32.310 --> 14:36.000
Honestly, honestly,
older women are very hot.

14:36.000 --> 14:39.655
<i>And I know I got the swag
and I got the game for them.</i>

14:39.655 --> 14:41.551
Wow. This is like news to me.

14:42.655 --> 14:45.137
- Yes, Mom. Yes.
- Hmm.

14:45.137 --> 14:46.448
I'm Joey.
Nice to meet you.

14:46.448 --> 14:48.275
- Hey.
- What's your name?

14:48.275 --> 14:49.793
- I'm April.
- April, nice to meet you.

14:49.793 --> 14:51.689
- How are you?
- I'm doing great.

14:51.689 --> 14:53.655
- How about you?
- I'm fine.

14:53.655 --> 14:55.793
But whenever
I bring a woman home,

14:55.793 --> 14:58.862
it's all up to my mom
whether I'm dating her or not.

14:58.862 --> 15:00.172
Yes!

15:03.068 --> 15:05.689
Been winning. Been winning.

15:05.689 --> 15:06.758
- Hi.
- Soyoung.

15:06.758 --> 15:08.000
- How are you?
- So young.

15:08.000 --> 15:10.827
- Oh, amazing.
- Soyoung.

15:10.827 --> 15:12.655
Amazing, amazing, amazing.

15:16.689 --> 15:19.827
I think I have eye on,
uh, Jose.

15:19.827 --> 15:21.413
He's a perfect age for me.

15:21.413 --> 15:22.827
He don't have a tattoo.

15:22.827 --> 15:25.172
He's got green eyes.

15:25.172 --> 15:27.586
Kind of what I'm looking for.

15:27.586 --> 15:28.827
How is everything?

15:28.827 --> 15:30.068
It's amazing.
How are you?

15:30.068 --> 15:31.206
- It's good.
- Good.

15:31.206 --> 15:32.413
- Yeah.
- Good to see you.

15:32.413 --> 15:34.344
<i>I'm feeling a little weird.</i>

15:34.344 --> 15:36.655
<i>All these women
are significantly older women,</i>

15:36.655 --> 15:38.724
so it's pretty alarming.

15:38.724 --> 15:41.275
Not in a bad way.

15:41.275 --> 15:44.206
Let's go.
We need to hit the bar.

15:44.206 --> 15:46.724
<i>But then I started
looking at these women,</i>

15:46.724 --> 15:51.034
and I was like, "Damn,
they are kind of beautiful."

15:51.034 --> 15:52.931
And then my mom's right there
and I was like...

15:55.758 --> 15:58.448
Hey, you guys,
I've got this text.

15:58.448 --> 16:01.517
So it says, "Greetings.

16:01.517 --> 16:04.310
You are about to start
a unique dating journey.

16:04.310 --> 16:06.241
All of you have expressed
an openness

16:06.241 --> 16:08.275
to intergenerational dating.

16:08.275 --> 16:10.793
In the real world, there
is often a double standard

16:10.793 --> 16:11.931
where an older man

16:11.931 --> 16:14.103
with a younger woman
is accepted,

16:14.103 --> 16:16.758
but an older woman
with a younger man isn't."

16:16.758 --> 16:19.068
- Mm-hmm.
-"Not here."

16:19.068 --> 16:20.172
Whoo!

16:21.310 --> 16:23.655
- Okay, I got one, too.
- Oh.

16:23.655 --> 16:25.448
"Over the next few weeks,

16:25.448 --> 16:27.896
you'll be part
of a dating experiment

16:27.896 --> 16:29.655
that will level
the playing field

16:29.655 --> 16:31.931
and see if you can find
that special someone

16:31.931 --> 16:33.758
from a different age group."

16:33.758 --> 16:35.310
I got a text guys.

16:36.551 --> 16:39.172
"You are not exactly
on the show
you thought you were on.

16:39.172 --> 16:41.241
You are now
in the same dating pool.

16:41.241 --> 16:42.413
Open your minds

16:42.413 --> 16:45.620
and have an experience
you may have never imagined."

16:45.620 --> 16:46.896
Hmm.

16:46.896 --> 16:48.482
I'll be in the hot tub
at 10:00.

16:50.103 --> 16:52.586
Please, Ma,
you gotta chill out.

16:52.586 --> 16:55.172
I'm so excited
to meet these other guys.

16:55.172 --> 16:57.068
Sign me up.

16:57.068 --> 16:59.137
Don't judge me.

16:59.137 --> 17:00.275
Sorry, ladies.

17:00.275 --> 17:02.517
I might be sleeping
with your son.

17:02.517 --> 17:04.517
Looks like we're going
on a date, Harrison.

17:04.517 --> 17:05.965
Yeah, right.

17:05.965 --> 17:08.517
He goes, "Yeah, right."

17:08.517 --> 17:10.482
- Do you need to go home?
- No.

17:10.482 --> 17:12.137
It feels awkward because,
like, I didn't think

17:12.137 --> 17:13.379
it was just gonna be all moms.

17:13.379 --> 17:14.827
I just got here.

17:14.827 --> 17:16.724
<i>I'm not saying
the women are unattractive.</i>

17:16.724 --> 17:18.896
I'm just saying
they all have sons.

17:18.896 --> 17:20.758
And, like,
um, this is gonna be

17:20.758 --> 17:22.758
a weird experience
getting close with the guys,

17:22.758 --> 17:25.862
then, you know, going out
on dates with their mothers.

17:29.758 --> 17:31.413
She's cutting open people
and stuff.

17:31.413 --> 17:33.241
I would die there.

17:33.241 --> 17:34.655
Like, I see
a little bit of blood,

17:34.655 --> 17:36.344
a little bit of blood
and me and you...

17:36.344 --> 17:37.482
you, too, we faint.

17:37.482 --> 17:38.689
Tell them
what your favorite is.

17:38.689 --> 17:40.482
- What do you like to do?
- Yeah.
Tell me, tell me.

17:40.482 --> 17:41.620
Heart surgeon.

17:41.620 --> 17:42.758
Heart?

17:42.758 --> 17:44.758
- Oh, my God.
You're my hero.
- What?

17:44.758 --> 17:47.413
I am here to find
a special connection,

17:47.413 --> 17:49.931
and I hope my mom also finds
a special connection.

17:49.931 --> 17:51.965
<i>She's getting older, you know,
like she's not really, like,</i>

17:51.965 --> 17:54.724
out there looking
for a lover every day, right?

17:54.724 --> 17:55.896
You're not really,
like, out there

17:55.896 --> 17:57.034
actively searching, are you?

17:57.034 --> 17:59.655
Well, Jimmy thinks so,
but who knows, right?

17:59.655 --> 18:02.379
We might find
the perfect love in here.

18:02.379 --> 18:04.586
Jimmy don't know about me.

18:04.586 --> 18:06.137
<i>It's not the blood
that makes me faint.</i>

18:06.137 --> 18:09.137
<i>It's more so like seeing
the beating heart in a body.</i>

18:09.137 --> 18:10.793
<i>I am open to all ages.</i>

18:10.793 --> 18:13.241
<i>My dating app is set to 65.</i>

18:13.241 --> 18:14.827
I'm close-minded, I guess.

18:14.827 --> 18:17.206
I don't want to date
with 65-years-old man.

18:18.413 --> 18:19.793
So you're gonna be 24.

18:19.793 --> 18:21.137
- Your son's 23?
- No, he's 20.

18:21.137 --> 18:22.758
I'm about 21.

18:22.758 --> 18:24.620
Oh, you're the baby.

18:24.620 --> 18:26.103
And you're gonna be 22, right?

18:26.103 --> 18:28.379
- I'm gonna be 22.
- He said you're both
the same age.

18:28.379 --> 18:30.724
Ooh...

18:32.793 --> 18:34.413
And I'm probably the oldest.

18:35.586 --> 18:37.620
Oh, no way.

18:37.620 --> 18:40.103
There's no way.

18:40.103 --> 18:43.137
April is the woman
who immediately caught my eye.

18:43.137 --> 18:45.758
<i>I would like to get closer
with April. Who knows?</i>

18:45.758 --> 18:48.482
Maybe I could get her
out of her comfort zone

18:48.482 --> 18:51.103
and show her what it's like
with a younger man.

18:51.103 --> 18:52.448
That's a beautiful ring,
by the way.

18:52.448 --> 18:53.586
Thank you.

18:53.586 --> 18:55.241
Kind of reminds me
of your face.

18:57.413 --> 18:59.448
Younger guys seem like
they have a zest for life.

18:59.448 --> 19:01.103
They're not jaded.

19:01.103 --> 19:03.310
And even though
I'm this age, I...

19:03.310 --> 19:05.931
I've always been very physical
and have a high sex drive.

19:05.931 --> 19:07.655
So if you're gonna have
a younger guy,

19:07.655 --> 19:10.965
there's gonna be
a lot more sex, I would think.

19:10.965 --> 19:12.862
Joey, Joey,
which one's your mom?

19:12.862 --> 19:14.103
- Yeah.
- Ha!

19:14.103 --> 19:15.620
- Just kidding.
- There she is.

19:15.620 --> 19:17.310
You really want me
to point her out?

19:17.310 --> 19:18.758
It's pretty obvious.

19:18.758 --> 19:20.448
Joey is just a young buck,

19:20.448 --> 19:22.482
and he's just probably gonna

19:22.482 --> 19:24.413
do something to my mom and try
and hit on another girl,

19:24.413 --> 19:25.551
then another girl.

19:25.551 --> 19:28.034
So he's not going
anywhere near my mother.

19:28.034 --> 19:29.482
Joey is gonna get a left hook.

19:29.482 --> 19:30.793
- I'm not kidding.
- He's fun.

19:30.793 --> 19:32.862
Joey is...
I'm not worried about Joey.

19:32.862 --> 19:34.482
Gabriel and I are both here

19:34.482 --> 19:38.310
because we wanted
to take this adventure.

19:38.310 --> 19:41.931
It literally fell in our lap
from the heavens, and...

19:41.931 --> 19:43.655
I can't. I'm sorry.
Oh, my God.

19:43.655 --> 19:45.827
Just, can you stop
and just let me talk?

19:45.827 --> 19:47.448
Can you do it again?
Can you not say...

19:47.448 --> 19:48.724
why are you saying heavens?

19:48.724 --> 19:50.379
Because
that's what I'm saying.

19:50.379 --> 19:51.931
I am my own person.

19:51.931 --> 19:53.310
But can you stop
interrupting me?

19:53.310 --> 19:54.931
So...

19:54.931 --> 19:56.172
I'm sorry.

19:56.172 --> 19:58.137
Ma, Jose is your man.

19:58.137 --> 19:59.655
Jose looks mad responsible.

19:59.655 --> 20:00.965
- Like, I would trust--
- What?

20:00.965 --> 20:02.862
Said you look mad
responsible, like...

20:02.862 --> 20:04.275
like you look
very trustworthy.

20:04.275 --> 20:07.000
Jose, cut the umbilical cord.

20:07.000 --> 20:08.620
No, I mean, we're having
a good conversation.

20:08.620 --> 20:09.827
We're learning a lot here.

20:09.827 --> 20:11.310
- We can, we can...
- Pola...

20:11.310 --> 20:12.965
You're more than
welcome to join.

20:12.965 --> 20:15.827
There's this super-hot guy
named Jose,

20:15.827 --> 20:17.379
<i>and he seems like a safe bet</i>

20:17.379 --> 20:19.310
because he's
very family-oriented.

20:19.310 --> 20:21.517
You can see, he's like tied
to his mom's hip.

20:21.517 --> 20:25.137
So I feel like he would
definitely just have my back

20:25.137 --> 20:28.793
and be by my side
and, you know,
be in my corner.

20:28.793 --> 20:30.172
I'm not calling you Dad.

20:31.482 --> 20:33.379
<i>I feel like I need
to get him away from his mom</i>

20:33.379 --> 20:36.379
and then see, you know,
what we can end up doing.

20:37.517 --> 20:39.172
You're not,
you're not calling him Dad.

20:39.172 --> 20:40.275
You're calling him Daddy.

20:41.758 --> 20:43.137
No, I'm calling him Daddy.

20:43.137 --> 20:45.344
Oh!

20:46.620 --> 20:48.689
Out of all
of the women here,

20:48.689 --> 20:51.965
Kelle is definitely going
for all of the attention.

20:51.965 --> 20:53.793
It's almost like
she's campaigning.

20:53.793 --> 20:55.137
You call him father.

20:56.793 --> 20:58.896
It seems like
a lot of work to me.

21:04.206 --> 21:05.517
"Attention, daters.

21:05.517 --> 21:07.689
There are eight duos here

21:07.689 --> 21:09.931
and there are eight bedrooms
in the villa.

21:11.103 --> 21:14.000
Each duo will share
a room together."

21:14.000 --> 21:16.517
I'll be honest, I had
concerns about rooming

21:16.517 --> 21:22.241
with Ryan because in the past
I have seen his home.

21:22.241 --> 21:25.344
Mmm, not the child
that I raised,

21:25.344 --> 21:26.758
<i>as far as cleanliness.</i>

21:26.758 --> 21:30.172
We don't get to spend
as much time together
as we used to.

21:30.172 --> 21:32.551
So instead of shading me,
if anything,

21:32.551 --> 21:35.724
this is a moment
to bring us closer together.

21:35.724 --> 21:37.551
"Not all the rooms
are the same.

21:37.551 --> 21:40.068
There are two large
master suites

21:40.068 --> 21:41.724
with hot tubs inside
the room."

21:41.724 --> 21:43.103
- That's crazy.
- Oh, my God.

21:43.103 --> 21:44.758
"Head outside,
where the moms

21:44.758 --> 21:47.965
who are the most
in touch with their sons
will win the suites."

21:49.068 --> 21:51.758
Okay. Super weird.

21:51.758 --> 21:53.344
<i>When we get the text
that we're gonna be</i>

21:53.344 --> 21:55.275
staying in the same bedroom,

21:55.275 --> 21:56.931
<i>my mom and I were
really close,</i>

21:56.931 --> 21:59.344
but dating lives
are very separate.

21:59.344 --> 22:01.655
<i>I don't want to see
who she's trying to flirt on,</i>

22:01.655 --> 22:04.275
<i>and now we're gonna be
living together.</i>

22:04.275 --> 22:07.068
What did I get myself into?

22:07.068 --> 22:08.896
Who wants to sleep
with their moms?

22:08.896 --> 22:10.137
Weird.

22:12.068 --> 22:14.448
All the young men
take their shirts off.

22:14.448 --> 22:15.827
<i>Who's ready
for a checkup</i>

22:15.827 --> 22:17.758
<i>at the doctor's office?</i>

22:17.758 --> 22:21.034
Oh, that's nice. Oh.

22:21.034 --> 22:24.551
I have no interest in watching
my mom feeling a man.

22:24.551 --> 22:25.827
<i>I'm not here for that.</i>

22:25.827 --> 22:27.758
<i>Nothing wrong
with a little touch and feel.</i>

22:30.586 --> 22:31.827
<i>Where are
we going with this?</i>

22:31.827 --> 22:33.931
Are we... you're trying
to get day one strokes?

22:33.931 --> 22:35.137
Like, I don't know.

22:35.137 --> 22:37.827
You're joking!

22:37.827 --> 22:39.172
I'm cock-blocking my mom

22:39.172 --> 22:41.655
because you've known him
for six hours.

22:41.655 --> 22:43.172
Calm down.

22:43.172 --> 22:44.379
No.

22:48.448 --> 22:50.068
- I have twins.
- Do you?

22:50.068 --> 22:51.655
Three boys.
Gabriel is a twin.

22:51.655 --> 22:52.793
Oh, wow.

22:52.793 --> 22:54.586
But they don't
look alike, fraternal.

22:54.586 --> 22:57.068
- Fraternal.
- So you brought
the ugly one. Thanks.

23:00.655 --> 23:01.793
We get a text.

23:01.793 --> 23:03.517
We have our first challenge,

23:03.517 --> 23:06.068
<i>and all the young men
take their shirts off.</i>

23:06.068 --> 23:10.137
I want you and you
and you and you.

23:10.137 --> 23:11.896
Everyone but me.

23:11.896 --> 23:13.000
Sorry.

23:13.000 --> 23:16.482
The moms get a blindfold
and they have to go up

23:16.482 --> 23:18.586
<i>and touch
all of the young men</i>

23:18.586 --> 23:22.413
<i>and figure out by touching
their chests and abs
and shoulders</i>

23:22.413 --> 23:24.344
<i>which one is their son.</i>

23:24.344 --> 23:26.413
<i>The two moms
that figure out</i>

23:26.413 --> 23:28.793
<i>who their son is
the quickest win</i>

23:28.793 --> 23:31.586
the best suites
in the whole house.

23:31.586 --> 23:34.000
So the competition is on.

23:34.000 --> 23:37.448
I need you guys to help me
find my son

23:37.448 --> 23:38.862
if you want to hang out
with me tonight.

23:40.758 --> 23:42.482
Oh, my God.

23:42.482 --> 23:45.000
<i>This challenge is
very important for you to win.</i>

23:45.000 --> 23:47.517
Okay, so be focused,
and we're gonna win.

23:47.517 --> 23:50.137
I want to stay in the suite,
so we have to be careful.

23:50.137 --> 23:51.344
Quick.

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
Who wants to win?

23:55.000 --> 23:56.931
You've never rubbed me up
and down.

23:56.931 --> 23:58.344
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah.

23:58.344 --> 24:00.551
You don't know
who's who, so...

24:02.275 --> 24:03.862
I'm ready.

24:03.862 --> 24:05.827
<i>I just hope she doesn't go
below the waist</i>

24:05.827 --> 24:07.172
whenever she's
groping these guys,

24:07.172 --> 24:10.448
because that,
that will be out of line.

24:10.448 --> 24:11.931
Out of line.

24:14.896 --> 24:17.827
There's still mommies
in the house!

24:17.827 --> 24:20.586
If I pick Joey, hopefully
I don't pick him first,

24:20.586 --> 24:23.931
because, yeah, we'll have
a nice room, but it's like...

24:25.172 --> 24:26.655
I kind of want more than that.

24:27.896 --> 24:29.068
Hmm.

24:29.068 --> 24:31.379
Not rigid, ain't it?

24:31.379 --> 24:32.517
No.

24:32.517 --> 24:34.137
Ooh.

24:36.517 --> 24:38.413
Mmm...

24:38.413 --> 24:40.137
I don't think so. Nope.

24:41.344 --> 24:43.068
No. Ow.

24:44.862 --> 24:47.965
<i>I've never experienced
something like this.</i>

24:47.965 --> 24:50.689
My mom never really shows me

24:50.689 --> 24:53.379
<i>like the younger guys
that she dates.</i>

24:53.379 --> 24:56.241
<i>Or especially, like,
touching them
in front of my face.</i>

24:56.241 --> 24:58.206
I mean, that's...
that's pretty weird to me.

25:01.551 --> 25:02.827
Joey?

25:03.931 --> 25:05.482
This is my son.

25:05.482 --> 25:08.275
Ugh, Ma!
You're one off.

25:09.413 --> 25:11.206
I got Jimmy?
I got Jimmy?

25:11.206 --> 25:13.103
Oh, Mom. Ugh!

25:13.103 --> 25:14.862
He got you!
I knew he would.

25:14.862 --> 25:16.551
- Yes! Yes!
- I knew he would!

25:16.551 --> 25:18.379
I wanted
you to be my son.

25:18.379 --> 25:21.068
Yeah! Whoo!

25:21.068 --> 25:23.379
Whoo! Yes!

25:23.379 --> 25:25.931
- Oh, my God.
- <i>Kelle gets Jimmy.</i>

25:25.931 --> 25:27.482
And she was
really touchy, touchy.

25:27.482 --> 25:29.241
Fantasy suite! Sorry,

25:29.241 --> 25:30.448
Soyoung.

25:33.724 --> 25:35.379
That would have been game, right?

25:35.379 --> 25:37.206
All men touching women.

25:37.206 --> 25:39.862
That would have been killer.

25:39.862 --> 25:41.103
You should've done that.

25:42.586 --> 25:44.379
Here we go.
Here we go.

25:45.965 --> 25:49.103
Who's ready for a checkup
at the doctor's office?

25:51.241 --> 25:54.448
Oh, that's nice.

25:54.448 --> 25:55.655
Oh.

25:55.655 --> 25:59.275
I have no interest in watching
my mom feel on men.

25:59.275 --> 26:00.655
I'm not here for that.

26:00.655 --> 26:03.172
Oh, nice pecks.

26:03.172 --> 26:04.413
Nice traps.

26:04.413 --> 26:06.620
Oh. Mmm.

26:06.620 --> 26:08.103
<i>We are both grown.</i>

26:08.103 --> 26:11.862
<i>And nothing wrong
with a little touch and feel.</i>

26:11.862 --> 26:13.655
- <i>Fine.</i>
- I'm just saying.

26:13.655 --> 26:14.793
Okay.

26:14.793 --> 26:16.655
This feels like my child.

26:16.655 --> 26:18.034
Okay, I'm gonna say yes.

26:18.034 --> 26:20.275
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.

26:23.551 --> 26:26.586
Like I will notice
Jose's shoulder.

26:26.586 --> 26:29.862
It's like very... deep.

26:29.862 --> 26:31.275
I know your shoulders.

26:31.275 --> 26:33.931
Me and Jose train
every day at my studio,

26:33.931 --> 26:36.034
so this is really easy for me.

26:37.241 --> 26:39.000
This is Jose. Oh!

26:45.413 --> 26:46.620
<i>I'm a trainer.</i>

26:46.620 --> 26:48.827
You know,
I appreciate muscle.

26:48.827 --> 26:51.758
So I actually like
this challenge.

26:51.758 --> 26:53.034
I didn't like this challenge.

26:54.689 --> 26:56.310
- That's my Gabriel.
- Yeah.

26:58.724 --> 27:00.344
Harrison.

27:00.344 --> 27:01.758
No?

27:01.758 --> 27:04.206
I was right here.
I was right here.

27:06.206 --> 27:08.517
Well, is there
somebody over here?

27:08.517 --> 27:09.724
Billy.

27:09.724 --> 27:11.206
- Wow.
- That was pretty quick.

27:11.206 --> 27:12.413
This is Billy.

27:19.137 --> 27:20.448
<i>I'm very excited,</i>

27:20.448 --> 27:22.344
so I could feel
the abs a little bit.

27:24.103 --> 27:25.344
Hmm.

27:33.965 --> 27:37.724
Soyoung's style of trying
to pick her son

27:37.724 --> 27:40.448
was very aggressive,
in my opinion.

27:41.896 --> 27:43.172
What?

27:44.344 --> 27:45.689
She's wild.

27:49.517 --> 27:50.862
That's my son.

27:50.862 --> 27:52.344
Yes, it is!

28:05.586 --> 28:07.448
Yeah, he does.

28:07.448 --> 28:08.551
<i>Can you not...</i>

28:08.551 --> 28:10.344
It sounds so bad. Yeah.
I picked up women, really?

28:10.344 --> 28:13.137
Okay, okay, okay. Okay. Okay.
I won't say that.

28:13.137 --> 28:15.482
I have definitely raised
a gentleman.

28:15.482 --> 28:17.482
Aww.

28:17.482 --> 28:19.000
Guys, I have a text.

28:20.517 --> 28:23.000
"Congratulations.
Your time is a winner."

28:25.275 --> 28:26.620
"You get the suite."

28:26.620 --> 28:28.068
Wow.

28:28.068 --> 28:29.586
Who's the second winner?

28:29.586 --> 28:30.931
Wait, another text message.

28:30.931 --> 28:32.344
I got a text message.

28:34.103 --> 28:35.827
So it says, congratulations.

28:35.827 --> 28:37.000
I was second place.

28:37.000 --> 28:40.137
I get the suite
with a hot tub on the patio.

28:40.137 --> 28:41.793
You're all welcome.

28:43.137 --> 28:45.241
Yeah, Jose!

28:45.241 --> 28:46.413
Jose, I got last.

28:46.413 --> 28:49.724
So you can meet me
at the bungalow outside.

28:49.724 --> 28:51.448
Oh.

28:51.448 --> 28:53.172
<i>I don't get Kelle very well.</i>

28:53.172 --> 28:56.655
She needs to do something
to bring the attention to her.

28:56.655 --> 28:57.793
And I don't think that's nice,

28:57.793 --> 29:00.482
because you don't need
to always be

29:00.482 --> 29:02.137
the center of everything.

29:02.137 --> 29:03.344
I can't.

29:03.344 --> 29:05.758
Sorry,
I can't hear you over there.

29:14.448 --> 29:15.551
Moving in.

29:15.551 --> 29:17.000
Are you joking?

29:17.000 --> 29:18.206
<i>Hi,</i>

29:18.206 --> 29:20.655
- <i>welcome to my house.</i>
- Oh, my God.

29:20.655 --> 29:22.206
This is amazing, you know.

29:22.206 --> 29:23.862
- We won.
- Yeah.

29:23.862 --> 29:25.689
- We've won the suite.
- Thank God.

29:25.689 --> 29:27.896
You guys got, like,
a living room area.

29:27.896 --> 29:30.068
- <i>We have everything.</i>
- <i>Wow.</i>

29:30.068 --> 29:31.827
<i>I'm stoked about
being able to, like,</i>

29:31.827 --> 29:33.034
get in the sauna.

29:33.034 --> 29:34.689
<i>And then we have
the hot tub, too.</i>

29:34.689 --> 29:36.862
<i>Yeah, that was a plus.</i>

29:36.862 --> 29:39.000
Just don't bring
any of the moms in here.

29:39.000 --> 29:41.517
- Please do not do that.
- Okay, I won't.

29:41.517 --> 29:44.206
Wow.
I feel like a queen.

29:44.206 --> 29:46.724
Like the suite is gorgeous.

29:46.724 --> 29:48.793
The space is huge.

29:48.793 --> 29:50.551
- Wow.
- Yeah, that's super cool.

29:50.551 --> 29:52.000
<i>You're not worried
a little bit,</i>

29:52.000 --> 29:53.896
like just sleeping
in a stranger house with--

29:53.896 --> 29:56.206
No, I'm just gonna
stay close to you.

29:56.206 --> 29:57.655
Oh, you have
a good relationship.

29:57.655 --> 29:58.862
- So there's...
- So it's okay, right?

29:58.862 --> 30:00.206
I mean, I guess.

30:02.000 --> 30:04.137
Everything is beautiful.
- Yeah.

30:10.344 --> 30:13.034
You know, it's more common
for the guys to like
the older girls,

30:13.034 --> 30:14.379
you know,
that's kind of a thing.

30:14.379 --> 30:16.068
Like, they have MILF,
they have cougar.

30:16.068 --> 30:19.034
We don't have a cute label
for young guys.

30:19.034 --> 30:21.137
You should just call them
Ryan Jevons.

30:21.137 --> 30:23.137
I'm gonna put that name
on the outside of my room.

30:23.137 --> 30:25.068
I'll see. All right.
See, that's...

30:25.068 --> 30:26.896
I don't know, that could be
taken a lot of ways.

30:29.034 --> 30:31.137
<i>Kelle is not
the natural esthetic</i>

30:31.137 --> 30:33.379
for people that I date,

30:33.379 --> 30:35.689
but Kelle's energy
is tight hot.

30:35.689 --> 30:38.172
Like, her spice level
is at an all-time high.

30:39.586 --> 30:41.517
You never know
what's bound to happen.

30:41.517 --> 30:44.379
What do you think
is the difference between
MILF and cougar?

30:44.379 --> 30:45.655
I'll...
I'll tell you exactly

30:45.655 --> 30:48.068
the difference
because I am still a MILF.

30:48.068 --> 30:50.379
I am not a cougar until
I reach a certain age.

30:50.379 --> 30:52.413
MILF is like
that age between.

30:52.413 --> 30:53.896
I don't look at age, though.

30:53.896 --> 30:56.724
I think that's where society
is totally messed up

30:56.724 --> 30:59.000
because I attract
a lot of younger men

30:59.000 --> 31:00.551
because I have a younger...

31:00.551 --> 31:02.793
Spirit.
...spirit and personality.

31:02.793 --> 31:05.137
I felt a little displaced
just being here

31:05.137 --> 31:06.448
and seeing everyone, you know.

31:06.448 --> 31:08.655
- But it's like...
- Well...

31:08.655 --> 31:10.793
I think, everybody just has
to get out of their shell.

31:10.793 --> 31:13.758
People become too guarded,
then you don't learn anything

31:13.758 --> 31:15.103
and you'll never know
what you'll find.

31:15.103 --> 31:16.379
Yeah,
that's the truth.

31:16.379 --> 31:17.620
- I mean...
- Toast to that.

31:17.620 --> 31:20.275
<i>I'm actually realizing, like,</i>

31:20.275 --> 31:22.793
this is a chance for us
to learn about ourselves.

31:22.793 --> 31:24.793
Whether we all find
true love or not,

31:24.793 --> 31:26.793
<i>it's an opportunity
for growth,</i>

31:26.793 --> 31:28.103
<i>and there's some
great people here.</i>

31:28.103 --> 31:30.310
<i>Like, let's just enjoy
this moment,</i>

31:30.310 --> 31:32.620
because that's meant to be.

31:32.620 --> 31:33.758
I'm gonna go to the restroom,

31:33.758 --> 31:35.551
so I'm gonna say good night
if I don't see you.

31:35.551 --> 31:37.482
- Good night.
- Good night.

31:37.482 --> 31:39.793
I mean,
I honestly learned a lot from,

31:39.793 --> 31:40.931
like all of that talking.

31:40.931 --> 31:42.413
- I mean...
- You did?

31:42.413 --> 31:44.655
Everything that's come out
of his mouth has been
just straight facts.

31:44.655 --> 31:45.896
I'm just wrong.
I'm just wrong.

31:45.896 --> 31:47.413
- You know, I'm just like...
- You're welcome.

31:47.413 --> 31:48.793
This is your dad.

31:50.310 --> 31:52.241
Mom, you gotta be joking.

31:52.241 --> 31:54.034
You know what room we're in.

31:54.034 --> 31:56.620
Although I know
she's got it in her to flirt,

31:56.620 --> 31:58.068
and she does do that a lot,

31:58.068 --> 32:01.862
I've never seen it
firsthand experience.

32:01.862 --> 32:03.344
Ready?

32:03.344 --> 32:05.482
You two,
I'll see you tomorrow.

32:05.482 --> 32:06.758
No, we're going in together.

32:06.758 --> 32:08.034
Sleep easy.

32:08.034 --> 32:10.275
- Still give me love.
- We're going in together.

32:10.275 --> 32:11.517
Bye, Joey.

32:11.517 --> 32:13.034
The reason why we're here

32:13.034 --> 32:15.448
is to date everyone
in the villa,

32:15.448 --> 32:17.724
<i>and I'm taking
that opportunity</i>

32:17.724 --> 32:20.344
so I can make a good decision
on if there would be

32:20.344 --> 32:22.310
a romantic connection
with somebody.

32:22.310 --> 32:24.000
How are we gonna move
your mama out of the room?

32:24.000 --> 32:25.344
Now,
how could I do that?

32:25.344 --> 32:26.724
Can you pick her up?

32:26.724 --> 32:29.689
Y'all moving
your mama out of the room?

32:29.689 --> 32:30.965
No!

32:30.965 --> 32:33.517
I'll be kicking
Joey out of my room.

32:33.517 --> 32:34.655
- No!
- Bye, Joey.

32:34.655 --> 32:36.310
I'm not sleeping
on the bathroom.

32:36.310 --> 32:37.448
Please, no.

32:37.448 --> 32:39.965
For some reason,
I'm immediately drawn to Ryan.

32:39.965 --> 32:41.827
<i>And I mean,
I get it, it's night one,</i>

32:41.827 --> 32:45.034
<i>but I'm very, very open
with sex.</i>

32:45.034 --> 32:47.931
<i>I mean, I would love
to find love if it's here,</i>

32:47.931 --> 32:51.482
but more so, I'm gonna have
a lot of fun.

32:51.482 --> 32:53.586
I'm texting him right now.

32:53.586 --> 32:54.965
Mom.

32:54.965 --> 32:57.137
I go, "WYD?"

32:57.137 --> 33:00.137
What are you doing?

33:00.137 --> 33:01.862
Oh, he's messaging me back.

33:04.793 --> 33:06.689
Oh, wait,
I just got a message.

33:07.931 --> 33:10.448
"Where are you?"

33:10.448 --> 33:13.034
You said, "Come up here."

33:13.034 --> 33:15.655
Mom! Mom!

33:19.551 --> 33:20.827
I'm going to the bathroom.

33:20.827 --> 33:21.931
You go to bathroom.

33:23.586 --> 33:26.793
If Joey continues
to cock-block me
this entire time,

33:26.793 --> 33:28.862
he's going to ruin
the experience for me.

33:35.103 --> 33:36.655
The second room on the left.

33:36.655 --> 33:38.586
Oh, my God!

33:38.586 --> 33:40.551
You've got to be joking.

33:40.551 --> 33:41.758
Just chilling.

33:41.758 --> 33:43.413
Bye, Joey.

33:43.413 --> 33:45.068
Don't be a hater, Joey.

33:45.068 --> 33:47.724
Ma, you gotta chill out.

33:47.724 --> 33:49.068
Come upstairs.

33:50.586 --> 33:52.275
So far, we've had
some great conversations.

33:52.275 --> 33:54.448
I've been very open.
I've been very real with her.

33:54.448 --> 33:58.034
So at this point, you know,
where are we going with this?

33:58.034 --> 34:00.206
Are we... you're trying to get
the day one strokes?

34:00.206 --> 34:01.344
Like, I don't know.

34:05.793 --> 34:08.172
You're joking!

34:10.310 --> 34:11.413
We got, like,
moms here.

34:11.413 --> 34:13.172
Like, we got to really
step our game up.

34:13.172 --> 34:15.068
<i>I'm not like
head over heels for anyone.</i>

34:15.068 --> 34:16.172
<i>Are you?</i>

34:16.172 --> 34:17.448
I mean, I got my eye on one, though.

34:17.448 --> 34:18.896
- That's about it.
- Who?

34:18.896 --> 34:21.482
- <i>Pola.</i>
- <i>Pola has these feet that
I just want to, like,</i>

34:21.482 --> 34:22.586
<i>shove them in my mouth.</i>

34:31.586 --> 34:34.241
You're joking!

34:34.241 --> 34:36.586
Really not trying
to sleep in here

34:36.586 --> 34:39.206
with Ryan on the other bed.

34:39.206 --> 34:41.137
I'm just telling you
to make sure

34:41.137 --> 34:43.103
you're up in time to go
to the gym in the morning, bro.

34:43.103 --> 34:45.448
- No, Joey.
- I'll see you
at the gym tomorrow morning.

34:45.448 --> 34:46.931
All right, tomorrow morning, bro.

34:46.931 --> 34:49.000
- Joey, lay down.
- Make sure you're up.

34:50.689 --> 34:54.310
I'm cock-blocking my mom
because first night, no.

34:54.310 --> 34:56.551
You've known him
for six hours.

34:56.551 --> 34:59.034
You can't just immediately
go into,

34:59.034 --> 35:02.689
you know, I want to...
and then... yeah.

35:02.689 --> 35:04.931
Joey, calm down.

35:04.931 --> 35:07.103
- Calm down.
- No.

35:19.724 --> 35:22.448
I'm not, like,
head over heels for anyone.

35:22.448 --> 35:23.689
Are you?

35:23.689 --> 35:25.172
I mean, I got
my eye on one, though.

35:25.172 --> 35:26.275
- That's about it.
- Who?

35:26.275 --> 35:28.103
Pola.

35:28.103 --> 35:29.206
Yeah.

35:29.206 --> 35:31.793
I find Pola
absolutely beautiful.

35:31.793 --> 35:33.517
I'm a man of great taste.

35:33.517 --> 35:34.862
I like great things.

35:34.862 --> 35:36.275
<i>I'm a very big feet person.</i>

35:36.275 --> 35:38.344
<i>And Pola has these feet
that I just want to, like,</i>

35:38.344 --> 35:40.517
oil up and lather
and just massage

35:40.517 --> 35:42.965
and get real warm
and then paint her toenails

35:42.965 --> 35:47.758
maybe a color and, like,
suck the acrylic off them toes

35:47.758 --> 35:49.758
and shove them in my mouth.

35:49.758 --> 35:51.448
Yeah.

35:51.448 --> 35:52.827
Ha-ha!

35:52.827 --> 35:55.310
We can't be vanilla, bro.
We got, like, moms here.

35:55.310 --> 35:57.310
Like, we gotta really
step our game up.

35:57.310 --> 35:58.793
No.

36:04.137 --> 36:05.241
Wow.

36:05.241 --> 36:06.689
You think
this is gonna be good?

36:06.689 --> 36:08.000
- Dude, it's...
- Wow.

36:08.000 --> 36:09.724
It's a pineapple martini.

36:09.724 --> 36:11.896
It looks beautiful.
Thank you.

36:11.896 --> 36:13.172
So...

36:15.655 --> 36:17.413
- Thank you so much.
- For you, Madame.

36:17.413 --> 36:19.586
- Gracias, senor.
- Oh, you're so welcome.

36:21.482 --> 36:22.724
So, Pola, I was thinking

36:22.724 --> 36:24.275
I really would love
to get to know you

36:24.275 --> 36:25.413
and go on
a paddleboarding date,

36:25.413 --> 36:26.620
maybe if you're,
like, interested.

36:26.620 --> 36:29.000
Yes. That's cool.
Let's do it. Yeah.

36:29.000 --> 36:30.275
So it's down on the beach.

36:30.275 --> 36:32.206
The paddleboards
are over there if you'd like
to go with me.

36:32.206 --> 36:34.068
- Yeah.
Let's go. Let's go.
- Let's go.

36:35.241 --> 36:38.862
My mom is picked to go out
on her first date.

36:38.862 --> 36:40.034
I don't know what to think.

36:40.034 --> 36:41.448
Okay.

36:41.448 --> 36:42.724
It's our paddleboards.

36:42.724 --> 36:44.551
<i>It's just that feeling inside</i>

36:44.551 --> 36:46.482
<i>that I don't really
trust these guys yet.</i>

36:54.103 --> 36:58.379
Well, yeah. Most of the guys
are too young for my mom.

36:58.379 --> 36:59.827
So have you ever
paddleboarded before?

36:59.827 --> 37:01.413
Actually, I have
a paddleboard just...

37:01.413 --> 37:02.931
- No way, at home in Miami?
- Yeah. I do.

37:02.931 --> 37:04.068
- Oh, it's...
- I do, I do.

37:04.068 --> 37:06.758
Just don't be as naive
as you usually are.

37:08.000 --> 37:09.655
I'm sure
he's a nice guy.

37:09.655 --> 37:13.103
Many times the nicest guys
are not the nicest guys.

37:13.103 --> 37:14.413
Just be careful.

37:17.413 --> 37:19.758
Let's go, faster.

37:24.448 --> 37:25.965
<i>I dance classical ballet</i>

37:25.965 --> 37:27.931
<i>since I was four years old.</i>

37:27.931 --> 37:31.310
<i>I love everything that
has to do with physical,
active life.</i>

37:31.310 --> 37:34.931
So if a man cannot keep up
with me physically,

37:34.931 --> 37:38.068
I think I'm not gonna be
attracted to him at all.

37:38.068 --> 37:40.517
<i>And Jimmy, the activity
that he chose, what...</i>

37:40.517 --> 37:42.758
<i>it's exactly
what I really enjoy.</i>

37:42.758 --> 37:45.965
So that's something
that I really like about him.

37:47.241 --> 37:48.413
Whoo!

37:48.413 --> 37:51.000
At first, I'm really
nervous about Pola and I.

37:52.655 --> 37:55.172
But wow,
she was a very playful person

37:55.172 --> 37:56.344
and I love it about her.

37:56.344 --> 37:58.137
All right,
let's go. Let's go.

37:58.137 --> 38:01.482
She has the idea,
let's do yoga and wants
to do the airplane.

38:01.482 --> 38:03.827
And I'm... I'm so for it.

38:08.517 --> 38:10.620
I was comfortable being,
you know, on top of her.

38:10.620 --> 38:12.655
Are you ready?

38:16.413 --> 38:17.827
That wasn't good.

38:17.827 --> 38:20.724
<i>It's really fun doing
the airplane
on the board with Jimmy.</i>

38:20.724 --> 38:23.379
And I used to do that
with Jose when he was smaller.

38:23.379 --> 38:24.655
I love to do that with kids.

38:24.655 --> 38:26.620
So this is really fun for me.

38:26.620 --> 38:28.517
Ah, we did it.

38:28.517 --> 38:29.862
Oh!

38:32.689 --> 38:35.034
<i>I'm super glad that
Jimmy and Pola</i>

38:35.034 --> 38:36.551
<i>are on their mini date</i>

38:36.551 --> 38:38.862
<i>because now I get
a chance to talk to Jose.</i>

38:38.862 --> 38:40.137
He's like super-hot

38:40.137 --> 38:41.758
and I'm hoping to get
to know him better.

38:41.758 --> 38:43.068
I guess we're going
in the bedroom now

38:43.068 --> 38:44.206
that your mom's gone.

38:44.206 --> 38:45.413
I guess so.

38:45.413 --> 38:47.137
Kelle is very assertive,

38:47.137 --> 38:50.068
very... very direct in
what she wants.

38:50.068 --> 38:52.862
And I find that
attractive and sexy.

38:52.862 --> 38:54.344
I've never gone paddleboarding.

38:54.344 --> 38:55.482
It's super fun.

38:55.482 --> 38:56.862
I'll show you.
It's really cool.

38:56.862 --> 38:58.206
I'll probably have to be
on my knees.

38:59.344 --> 39:00.931
Well, you can start
on your knees.

39:02.137 --> 39:04.137
<i>I don't think that
my mom would approve,</i>

39:04.137 --> 39:06.724
but I'm a grown man.
I don't need her approval.

39:06.724 --> 39:08.931
But don't tell her
I said that.

39:08.931 --> 39:10.310
I'm gonna tell Jimmy
to take your mom

39:10.310 --> 39:11.862
all the way over to
that island over there.

39:12.965 --> 39:14.620
We'll stay there
for a couple of days.

39:14.620 --> 39:16.034
Pola, bye.

39:18.000 --> 39:20.724
Pola, I get
the fantasy suite tonight.

39:20.724 --> 39:21.827
Never.

39:21.827 --> 39:24.310
Kelle is not the type of girl
for Jose.

39:24.310 --> 39:26.034
I'm 100% sure.

39:26.034 --> 39:27.413
Do you see his body language?

39:27.413 --> 39:28.551
- Look at it.
- No.

39:28.551 --> 39:29.931
Whether she likes it or not,

39:29.931 --> 39:32.724
I'm gonna do whatever it takes
to take my man home.

39:32.724 --> 39:33.862
I like to win.

39:33.862 --> 39:35.068
Hey, Mom.

39:35.068 --> 39:36.206
No, I can't.

39:40.965 --> 39:42.689
- Can I steal you?
- Yeah, sure.

39:42.689 --> 39:45.034
- Yeah.
I have a question for you.
- Sure.

39:46.551 --> 39:49.448
I've had my eye on Jose
from day one,

39:49.448 --> 39:51.724
and I'm definitely
going for it.

39:53.241 --> 39:55.344
So, have you ever
dated older women?

39:55.344 --> 39:56.620
I don't think
I asked you that.

39:56.620 --> 40:00.000
Yeah, I usually go for older.

40:00.000 --> 40:02.448
See, and I usually
attract younger men.

40:02.448 --> 40:07.448
Her weak spot in my eyes
are accents, I think.

40:07.448 --> 40:09.551
I think accents
really get her.

40:09.551 --> 40:12.137
It doesn't matter
what you look like.

40:12.137 --> 40:13.620
I think if you have an accent,

40:13.620 --> 40:15.655
you have a chance
with my mom.

40:15.655 --> 40:16.862
You do.

40:16.862 --> 40:18.310
<i>It's really
not about the accent.</i>

40:18.310 --> 40:20.379
<i>It's like they're raised
in a different country,</i>

40:20.379 --> 40:22.758
so they have
a different demeanor

40:22.758 --> 40:24.137
and they treat women differently.

40:24.137 --> 40:25.275
Mm-hmm.

40:25.275 --> 40:27.275
They just so happen
to have an accent.

40:27.275 --> 40:29.586
I don't know why you're, like,
latched on this accent thing.

40:29.586 --> 40:30.862
It's not about the accent.

40:30.862 --> 40:33.689
That's just a bonus,
like, if you ask me.

40:33.689 --> 40:35.310
Are you here...
what are you here for?

40:35.310 --> 40:37.793
- I guess I'm just curious.
- Okay.

40:37.793 --> 40:40.379
I'm here for the same reason
as everybody else is,

40:40.379 --> 40:46.655
I guess, to, um, go outside
of the culture values

40:46.655 --> 40:49.448
that we have and explore

40:49.448 --> 40:52.758
different opportunities,
different relationships,

40:52.758 --> 40:54.379
different connections
with people

40:54.379 --> 40:57.379
that we would never do before.

40:57.379 --> 40:58.586
Am I putting you on the spot?

40:58.586 --> 40:59.724
No. Not at all.

40:59.724 --> 41:01.172
- I mean, on the contrary...
- Sorry.

41:01.172 --> 41:02.448
...on the contrary, actually...

41:02.448 --> 41:05.379
it's actually very,
very cool that...

41:05.379 --> 41:07.172
- I'm just curious.
- Yeah, yeah.

41:07.172 --> 41:08.896
And I appreciate
your question.

41:08.896 --> 41:10.551
Jose and I were
really connecting,

41:10.551 --> 41:12.103
as far as I'm concerned.

41:12.103 --> 41:15.344
<i>I think he moves very slowly,
which I don't like to do,</i>

41:15.344 --> 41:18.517
but I feel like
there's a potential there.

41:18.517 --> 41:20.586
I would love to keep on going
with that conversation.

41:20.586 --> 41:22.000
- Okay.
- For sure.

41:22.000 --> 41:23.758
I was feeling it, too.

41:23.758 --> 41:25.758
<i>Who do I think
will hook up first?</i>

41:25.758 --> 41:29.586
<i>I would probably say Kelle.</i>

41:29.586 --> 41:32.655
Last night
she was all over Ryan.

41:32.655 --> 41:34.103
<i>Now she's after Jose.</i>

41:34.103 --> 41:35.931
But I expect that of her.

41:35.931 --> 41:37.620
<i>She definitely wants to be</i>

41:37.620 --> 41:39.758
the belle of the ball
or the Barbie.

41:39.758 --> 41:42.862
<i>But I think
that it's a little much,</i>

41:42.862 --> 41:44.689
like this isn't a game show.

41:44.689 --> 41:46.103
- Salud.
- Salud.

41:46.103 --> 41:49.000
Oh. So I have to ask.

41:49.000 --> 41:52.241
- What?
- What is your type?

41:52.241 --> 41:54.655
I really like men that like
to do things like

41:54.655 --> 41:55.862
- what we just did.
- Uh-huh.

41:55.862 --> 41:57.758
I don't like men
that just sit down on TV

41:57.758 --> 41:59.586
and just watch TV
and do nothing.

41:59.586 --> 42:01.103
- Yeah.
- Yeah. What about you?

42:01.103 --> 42:02.482
Oh, my type. Let's see.

42:02.482 --> 42:04.517
What... what is my type?

42:04.517 --> 42:06.137
- I like dark hair.
- You do?

42:06.137 --> 42:08.172
<i>Good teeth,
good smile.</i>

42:08.172 --> 42:11.000
Being with Pola,
I feel super comfortable.

42:11.000 --> 42:12.413
I'm not even thinking of age.

42:12.413 --> 42:14.241
It just feels very good
and fluid,

42:14.241 --> 42:15.793
and there's no worries
in the world

42:15.793 --> 42:17.172
and we can just be ourselves.

42:17.172 --> 42:18.655
I prefer darker complexion
with green eyes.

42:18.655 --> 42:19.827
You do?

42:19.827 --> 42:21.000
- Green... green...
- Me too.

42:21.000 --> 42:22.275
Yeah.
Green is my favorite color.

42:22.275 --> 42:23.413
- Yeah, me too.
- Oh, yeah.

42:23.413 --> 42:24.724
- And dark hair.
- Mm-hmm.

42:24.724 --> 42:26.103
I don't like blonds.

42:26.103 --> 42:28.068
If I would've got green eyes,
it would've been over.

42:28.068 --> 42:29.275
That would've been perfect.

42:29.275 --> 42:30.931
That would've been over
for the world.

42:30.931 --> 42:33.862
I totally feel
a great connection with Jimmy

42:33.862 --> 42:37.068
and I feel really good about
myself with him.

42:37.068 --> 42:38.517
Who do you think Jose likes?

42:38.517 --> 42:39.724
Anybody...
interested in anybody?

42:39.724 --> 42:40.827
- Not really?
- Not yet.

42:40.827 --> 42:42.000
- Not yet?
- No.

42:42.000 --> 42:43.827
It takes him a little time
to build up a little?

42:43.827 --> 42:45.517
No, I would see it.

42:45.517 --> 42:47.896
I don't see his eyes like
shining for anyone.

42:47.896 --> 42:49.620
- Mm-hmm.
- No.

42:49.620 --> 42:51.310
Do you see my eyes shining
for anybody?

42:51.310 --> 42:52.620
- Mmm, yeah.
- Okay. All right.

42:53.827 --> 42:55.793
Oh, la-la.

42:55.793 --> 42:57.586
- We was paddleboarding.
- I did see it.

42:57.586 --> 42:59.344
It doesn't look like
paddleboarding to me.

42:59.344 --> 43:00.482
We did.

43:00.482 --> 43:02.137
It's not
what it looks like, I swear.

43:02.137 --> 43:04.172
It was really fun.
You want rose, Jose?

43:04.172 --> 43:05.724
We'll bring you
some rose, Jose.

43:05.724 --> 43:07.034
- No, no, no.
- Beautiful, thank you.

43:07.034 --> 43:08.724
No, drink up.

43:08.724 --> 43:10.034
We have our own rose.

43:10.034 --> 43:13.517
Pola, I get
the fantasy suite tonight.

43:13.517 --> 43:14.827
You don't.

43:14.827 --> 43:18.000
You actually don't. Never.

43:18.000 --> 43:20.586
I don't really know
Kelle a lot,

43:20.586 --> 43:22.724
but what I see
and what I feel,

43:22.724 --> 43:26.068
she's really wild,
and I really believe

43:26.068 --> 43:30.482
she's gonna bring drama
to my family, to my son,

43:30.482 --> 43:31.724
and to the relationship

43:31.724 --> 43:33.827
I have between
Jose and myself.

43:33.827 --> 43:37.172
So I don't think
she's the good catch for Jose.

43:37.172 --> 43:38.482
No.

43:38.482 --> 43:39.793
What if Jose falls in love
with Kelle?

43:39.793 --> 43:41.000
No, he won't.

43:41.000 --> 43:42.551
You see
his body language, though.

43:42.551 --> 43:43.689
- Look at it.
- No.

43:43.689 --> 43:45.068
It's talking.
It's talking to me.

43:45.068 --> 43:46.689
No.
No, I know it's not.

43:46.689 --> 43:48.655
- I know him.
- Oh, okay.

43:48.655 --> 43:50.241
Look how close
he is to her face.

43:50.241 --> 43:52.724
- That's an intimate...
- Not okay, no.

43:52.724 --> 43:56.068
Pola makes it very clear that
she just does not like Kelle.

43:56.068 --> 43:57.586
<i>So if Kelle wants Jose,</i>

43:57.586 --> 44:00.000
I'm thinking that Kelle's
gonna have to either,

44:00.000 --> 44:03.758
one, go through Pola
or two go around her back.

44:03.758 --> 44:05.931
Kelle.
Kelle without the Y.

44:05.931 --> 44:07.482
Kelle with an E.

44:07.482 --> 44:10.896
I think Jose is open to love
and I'm gonna show him

44:10.896 --> 44:12.551
that I'm the one
he should be with.

44:13.793 --> 44:15.758
- You're mine.
- You like tall men?

44:17.241 --> 44:19.551
- I like confident men.
- Okay.

44:19.551 --> 44:22.137
There's something going on
between me and her.

44:22.137 --> 44:25.310
That could be the start
of something very powerful.

44:25.310 --> 44:27.862
Jose likes very, like,
quiet girls, nice girls.

44:27.862 --> 44:28.965
Mmm.

44:28.965 --> 44:31.413
Kelle is not the type
of girl for Jose.

44:31.413 --> 44:33.448
I'm 100% sure.

44:33.448 --> 44:36.034
<i>So she's not gonna get
anywhere with Jose. Never.</i>

44:37.517 --> 44:39.551
- That's not Jose's style.
- I'm saying--

44:39.551 --> 44:42.620
- That won't happen.
- Hey, Mom.

44:42.620 --> 44:46.206
I'm not sure
if Pola is embracing
this whole situation.

44:46.206 --> 44:48.758
<i>Like, I thought she came
here to date a younger guy,</i>

44:48.758 --> 44:49.931
<i>not her son.</i>

44:49.931 --> 44:52.137
But whether
she likes it or not,

44:52.137 --> 44:54.620
<i>I'm gonna do whatever
it takes to take my man home.</i>

44:54.620 --> 44:57.034
So there is no competition, babe.

44:57.034 --> 44:58.931
If I had a date,
would you want to go with me?

44:58.931 --> 45:00.241
Sure.

45:00.241 --> 45:01.517
I like to win.

45:03.413 --> 45:05.482
- <i>It won't happen.</i>
- <i>But what if?</i>

45:05.482 --> 45:07.000
No, I can't.
