09:37.011 --> 09:38.752
I take my coffee black.

09:38.882 --> 09:41.885
Gwen takes hers
with two sugars and skim milk.

09:43.495 --> 09:45.802
I love this.

09:45.933 --> 09:47.674
There's a deli
on Prince and Broadway.

09:47.804 --> 09:49.632
Bacon, egg,
and cheese on a roll.

09:49.763 --> 09:52.069
Gwen will have a grapefruit--
may I?

09:52.200 --> 09:55.595
A grapefruit
and a roll with butter.

09:55.725 --> 09:57.597
As far as dinner goes,
I'm gonna need reservations

09:57.727 --> 10:00.991
for four at Raul's.

10:01.122 --> 10:03.211
And Gwen is going to need a car

10:03.341 --> 10:05.648
to take her uptown
to 84th and Madison.

10:05.779 --> 10:07.607
I think it's 84th Street.

10:07.737 --> 10:09.565
I need to check on that.

10:09.696 --> 10:11.611
Oh, speaking of which,
did she, um,

10:11.741 --> 10:13.482
talk to you about her weekend
travel arrangements?

10:13.613 --> 10:15.919
I think she wants
to move her flight to Monday.

10:16.050 --> 10:18.269
Are you okay with all this?

10:18.400 --> 10:19.619
- No problem.

10:19.749 --> 10:21.142
- [chuckling]

10:21.272 --> 10:22.143
- What?

10:22.273 --> 10:23.971
- I'm just fucking with you.

10:24.101 --> 10:25.668
I told you
you didn't need to do

10:25.799 --> 10:28.105
any of this bullshit,
all right?

10:28.236 --> 10:30.107
Oh, but do make sure
you check about the flight.

10:30.238 --> 10:31.543
Oh, by the way,
do you have a passport?

10:31.674 --> 10:32.675
- Yeah. Why?

10:32.806 --> 10:33.981
- You'll be going to Milan

10:34.111 --> 10:35.852
to shop for fabric with Gwen.

10:35.983 --> 10:37.854
- Really?
When would this be?

10:37.985 --> 10:39.987
- Check with Gwen
for the details.

10:40.117 --> 10:42.206
Oh, kid, welcome to the team.

10:43.555 --> 10:44.992
- [laughs]

10:49.823 --> 10:52.042
- What are you doing here?

10:52.173 --> 10:53.696
- I'm gonna walk you
to your audition.

10:53.827 --> 10:55.132
- Why would you do that?

10:55.263 --> 10:56.743
Didn't we break up last night?

10:56.873 --> 10:58.179
- I know,

10:58.309 --> 11:00.834
but I still figured
you could use a pep talk.

11:00.964 --> 11:02.966
- All right.
Let's walk and talk.

11:03.097 --> 11:05.665
- So?
How are you?

11:05.795 --> 11:06.970
You got this?

11:07.101 --> 11:09.320
- No.
I'm fucking terrified.

11:09.451 --> 11:10.757
- That's understandable.

11:10.887 --> 11:12.019
But remember,

11:12.149 --> 11:14.064
you're an incredible dancer,right?

11:14.195 --> 11:15.109
You just go in there
and do it the same way

11:15.239 --> 11:17.198
you've been
rehearsing all week.

11:17.328 --> 11:19.679
Keep in mind they auditioned
over 500 girls for this

11:19.809 --> 11:21.158
and they're down to 20, right?

11:21.289 --> 11:23.117
So that means
you got a good chance.

11:23.247 --> 11:24.858
- Yeah, but they're only
choosing two new dancers,

11:24.988 --> 11:27.338
so what are the odds there?

11:27.469 --> 11:29.863
- Well, it's like
fucking ten to one, right?

11:29.993 --> 11:32.039
Which aren't good.

11:32.169 --> 11:33.997
But you are.

11:34.128 --> 11:34.868
You're gonna go in there,
and you're gonna

11:34.998 --> 11:36.783
get this fucking job.

11:38.959 --> 11:42.484
- Are you really
this nice a fucking guy, Luke?

11:42.614 --> 11:44.878
- No.

11:45.008 --> 11:46.967
I'm just in love with you.

11:48.795 --> 11:49.883
- All right.

11:50.013 --> 11:52.320
Come on.
- Yeah?

11:52.450 --> 11:54.148
- [laughs]
You think you need my help?

11:54.278 --> 11:55.671
No, Pags,
I need your help here, okay?

11:55.802 --> 11:57.064
I'm the one that's
sitting here contemplating

11:57.194 --> 11:58.282
dropping out of business school

11:58.413 --> 11:59.675
to join this band
that's already broken up.

11:59.806 --> 12:01.155
I mean, wh--
God, what is going on?

12:01.285 --> 12:03.157
- No, they're not
broken up, okay?

12:03.287 --> 12:05.725
It's--it's--
it's just a hiccup.

12:05.855 --> 12:07.552
And I'm gonna fix it.Just--

12:07.683 --> 12:10.686
I need a little bit of help,
so what happened?

12:10.817 --> 12:14.168
- I mean, well, Lizzie was
definitely in the wrong, okay?

12:14.298 --> 12:16.300
And she completely
dismissed Genie's song,

12:16.431 --> 12:18.999
and the worst part is it was
actually a really good song.

12:19.129 --> 12:21.131
- Ugh, God.
Just as we're about to get

12:21.262 --> 12:23.394
some success, we implode?

12:23.525 --> 12:24.700
I mean, who the fuck
do they think they are,

12:24.831 --> 12:26.136
the goddamn Sex Pistols?

12:26.267 --> 12:27.921
They break up after one album.

12:28.051 --> 12:30.271
- Forget the album, we didn't
even get to play the gig.

12:30.401 --> 12:32.055
If I am being honest though,

12:32.186 --> 12:34.797
I think I do know why Lizzie
reacted the way she did.

12:34.928 --> 12:36.451
I'm not even sure
she's entirely aware.

12:36.581 --> 12:38.366
- Wait, what do you mean?

12:38.496 --> 12:42.283
- The song, the--the lyrics are
all about this unrequited love.

12:42.413 --> 12:44.328
And by the way
Genie was looking at Lizzie

12:44.459 --> 12:47.157
the entire time
she was singing it,

12:47.288 --> 12:48.942
yeah, I'm pretty sure
Genie wrote this song

12:49.072 --> 12:50.117
about your sister.

12:50.247 --> 12:52.249
- Wait, wh--
what, you serious?

12:52.380 --> 12:54.643
- Yeah.
I mean, does that surprise you?

12:54.774 --> 12:56.210
They've been connected
at the hip forever.

12:56.340 --> 12:57.951
- Well, no.

12:58.081 --> 12:59.953
Now that you mention it,

13:00.083 --> 13:01.302
it kind of makes sense.

13:01.432 --> 13:04.044
Ah, you know what that means?

13:04.174 --> 13:06.742
Another inter-band
relationship.

13:06.873 --> 13:08.352
God, that's how we lost
the fucking drummer

13:08.483 --> 13:09.963
in the first place!

13:10.093 --> 13:11.965
They never work, ever.

13:12.095 --> 13:14.358
I mean, just think Stevie Nicks
and Lindsey Buckingham.

13:14.489 --> 13:16.186
- And John and Christine McVie.

13:16.317 --> 13:18.058
- Yeah, and that's all
in the same band.

13:18.188 --> 13:19.929
Not to mention
The Mamas and The Papas,

13:20.060 --> 13:21.235
fucking Sonny and Cher.

13:21.365 --> 13:22.279
- God, ABBA.

13:22.410 --> 13:23.715
Dude, both those
couples are divorced.

13:23.846 --> 13:26.109
- Ugh.

13:26.240 --> 13:29.765
This complicates things,
doesn't it?

13:29.896 --> 13:31.114
- I don't even know
if I'm right.

13:31.245 --> 13:33.203
I could be totally wrong
about Genie and Lizzie.

13:33.334 --> 13:34.814
I mean, I--
I might be totally off base.

13:34.944 --> 13:37.729
- Yeah, well,
if you are right...

13:37.860 --> 13:41.037
I don't think Lizzie's gonna
want to talk to me about it.

13:41.168 --> 13:44.954
So would you mind talking
to her for me?

13:45.085 --> 13:47.217
- For the sake
of our rock and roll dream--

13:47.348 --> 13:50.003
and a potentially
beautiful romance, yeah.

13:50.133 --> 13:52.179
Okay.
I'll do it again.

13:52.309 --> 13:53.310
- Is this for real?
You're not shitting me.

13:53.441 --> 13:54.703
You're taking me to Milan?
- [sighs]

13:54.834 --> 13:56.226
Have you ever been out
of the country before?

13:56.357 --> 13:58.838
- Uh, does Cancun
for spring break count?

13:58.968 --> 14:00.274
- No, but we are going
to rectify that,

14:00.404 --> 14:01.928
and you are going to love it.

14:02.058 --> 14:03.843
- Okay,
so when do we go?

14:03.973 --> 14:05.888
- We leave Monday,
and we'll be gone for a month.

14:06.019 --> 14:07.020
- Monday?
- Mm-hmm.

14:07.150 --> 14:09.370
- For a month?
[laughs]

14:09.500 --> 14:11.024
- No. No.

14:11.154 --> 14:12.373
What is happening?
- What?

14:12.503 --> 14:14.766
- You will not be leaving
some boyfriend behind

14:14.897 --> 14:17.204
that you're gonna be pining
for the whole time, are you?

14:17.334 --> 14:18.858
Because I had a girl
a few years ago.

14:18.988 --> 14:20.772
She lasted three days.

14:20.903 --> 14:22.774
That's right.
One, two, three.

14:22.905 --> 14:25.473
And then she got homesick and
had to run back to the asshole

14:25.603 --> 14:27.344
who already started
shtupping somebody else.

14:27.475 --> 14:29.129
- Yeah, no.
I got nothing like that.

14:29.259 --> 14:31.000
I mean, like, I did just sleep
with my ex-boyfriend and I do--

14:31.131 --> 14:32.262
- Okay.
Ah-da-da-da.

14:32.393 --> 14:33.263
I'm not your therapist.
I'm your boss.

14:33.394 --> 14:35.265
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay? Good.

14:35.396 --> 14:37.441
Because there's gonna be
a lot of travel in your future.

14:37.572 --> 14:39.226
And we work way too many hours

14:39.356 --> 14:41.881
and travel way too much
to ever really settle down.

14:42.011 --> 14:44.448
Teresa,
where's the plane ticket?

14:44.579 --> 14:45.536
Great job, honey.
- Here you go.

14:45.667 --> 14:47.364
Oh, thank you.

14:47.495 --> 14:49.192
- I was friends
with her mother, too.

14:49.323 --> 14:51.847
Now pack your bags.

14:51.978 --> 14:53.457
- Thank you.

14:53.588 --> 14:55.242
- [crying]

14:57.026 --> 14:58.985
- Stacey Ross?
- Yeah.

14:59.115 --> 15:00.290
- You're next.
Follow me, please.

15:00.421 --> 15:01.901
- Okay.

15:08.168 --> 15:10.083
- This is number 23.

15:14.435 --> 15:16.828
- What's your name?
- Um, it's Stacey Ross.

15:16.959 --> 15:19.005
And I just want to say
that it's an honor to be here.

15:19.135 --> 15:20.484
- Okay, Stacey.
Welcome back.

15:20.615 --> 15:23.923
- Can I just
take my sweater off?

15:24.053 --> 15:26.447
[clears throat]

15:26.577 --> 15:28.971
Uh, we're going to do the first
day's jazz combination.

15:29.102 --> 15:30.146
Is that all right?
- Yeah.

15:30.277 --> 15:31.234
Yeah, yeah, that sounds good.
- Great.

15:31.365 --> 15:32.366
Okay.

This is a thing of beauty.

- So you see, I am a man

17:16.122 --> 17:17.079
of my word, am I not?

17:17.210 --> 17:18.385
Do you remember years ago

17:18.515 --> 17:20.561
I said I was gonna
do this, right?

17:20.691 --> 17:23.129
I was going to buy an old
beater and restore it for you.

17:23.259 --> 17:25.218
I made a plan,
and I followed through.

17:25.348 --> 17:26.610
- [laughing]
Okay. And--

17:26.741 --> 17:28.134
and you're really just
giving this to me,

17:28.264 --> 17:29.483
even though I barely
helped you with it?

17:29.613 --> 17:31.267

17:31.398 --> 17:32.442
but on one condition.

17:32.573 --> 17:34.618

17:34.749 --> 17:36.533
making a plan
and following through,

17:36.664 --> 17:38.318
I want you to do the same thing
with your plan.

17:38.448 --> 17:40.102
And that means taking
your camera equipment,

17:40.233 --> 17:41.495
you're gonna load it
into this thing,

17:41.625 --> 17:43.062
and you're gonna
get on the road

17:43.192 --> 17:44.498
and take
that cross-country trip

17:44.628 --> 17:46.065
like you've been talking
about for years.

17:46.195 --> 17:47.718

It's--

17:47.849 --> 17:49.198
Right, you're right.

17:49.329 --> 17:50.591
- Are you sure?
Because I don't think

17:50.721 --> 17:51.940
you're ever gonna find
a better moment to do this.

17:52.071 --> 17:53.594
You're in between jobs.
You don't have a girlfriend.

17:53.724 --> 17:55.422

- Yeah, the timing it--

17:57.380 --> 17:58.425
it couldn't be better.

17:58.555 --> 18:01.384
- Well then, the car is yours.

- I would expect
nothing less, James.

18:13.396 --> 18:16.834
[engine revving]

18:17.792 --> 18:20.577
- Let's see what she can do.
- Let's see it, my man.

18:20.708 --> 18:23.580
[tires squealing]

18:30.848 --> 18:33.373
Like the kid said,
thing of beauty.

18:33.503 --> 18:36.463
[loud drumming]

18:42.860 --> 18:44.645
- Tammy.

18:44.775 --> 18:46.647
Tammy.

18:46.777 --> 18:49.128
Tammy!Tammy!

18:49.258 --> 18:50.607
- Oh. Hey.
Hi, Liz.

18:50.738 --> 18:52.566
Sorry.
- Hi.

18:52.696 --> 18:53.567
What the hell
are you doing here?

18:53.697 --> 18:56.744
- I was waiting
for you actually.

18:56.874 --> 18:58.093
Yeah, I was hoping
maybe we could talk

18:58.224 --> 19:00.269
about yesterday's rehearsal.

19:00.400 --> 19:02.445
- Man, did Nicky
put you up to this?

19:02.576 --> 19:05.709
- He did, but now
that I am also in the band,

19:05.840 --> 19:07.015
that is if we still
have a band...

19:07.146 --> 19:08.973
I don't know, I'd--

19:09.104 --> 19:11.759
I'd like to know what's
going on as well, you know?

19:11.889 --> 19:14.457
- Look, it's a nice song,
and I get that.

19:14.588 --> 19:15.980
All right?
- Mm-hmm.

19:16.111 --> 19:18.069
- And I said I would listen
to it and I did,

19:18.200 --> 19:19.723
but we don't
do shit like that.

19:19.854 --> 19:22.465
We don't.
We don't do fucking ballads.

19:22.596 --> 19:25.338
And we don't do fucking
acoustic folk, all right?

19:25.468 --> 19:26.817
That's the only reason
I said I didn't vibe it.

19:26.948 --> 19:28.602
- Okay, I understand that.
I do. I just think that,

19:28.732 --> 19:31.039
I don't know,
maybe rather than just

19:31.170 --> 19:33.302
dismissing it completely,
you could have talked to Genie,

19:33.433 --> 19:34.651
seen if you could work
on it together,

19:34.782 --> 19:37.045
make it fit the band,
instead of just

19:37.176 --> 19:39.047
immediately pissing on it.

19:39.178 --> 19:41.484
- Okay. Well, here's why
I immediately pissed on it,

19:41.615 --> 19:43.617
because in addition
to it being a love song,

19:43.747 --> 19:46.359
which I can't stand,
she wrote it by herself

19:46.489 --> 19:48.056
and we don't do that.

19:48.187 --> 19:50.145
She works on the music,
and then she comes to me,

19:50.276 --> 19:51.929
and we work on the lyrics
together as a team.

19:52.060 --> 19:54.628
And this one, she just fucking
went off and did it by herself.

19:54.758 --> 19:55.672
And if I'm
honest with myself,

19:55.803 --> 19:57.283
that's what pissed
me off the most.

19:57.413 --> 19:58.849
- Wait. Hang on.
Lizzie, is that

19:58.980 --> 20:00.329
really the only reason?

20:00.460 --> 20:01.504
- Yes, it's really
the only reason.

20:01.635 --> 20:03.245
- Have you listened
to the lyrics actually?

20:03.376 --> 20:05.421
- Yes--yes.
- Okay, um,

20:05.552 --> 20:07.815
"summers turned to fall,
my dreams as dead as Paul.

20:07.945 --> 20:11.601
"Linda--" or Lizzie,
"said she'd call.

20:11.732 --> 20:14.604
Now I'm crying in a ball
'cause I need her."

20:14.735 --> 20:16.302
Gosh.

20:16.432 --> 20:18.086
- Okay. So what
are you saying exactly?

20:18.217 --> 20:19.827
- Her.
You are--you are her.

20:19.957 --> 20:22.264
Linda. You are Linda.
Lizzie is Linda,

20:22.395 --> 20:23.657
the girl she's in love with.

20:23.787 --> 20:25.441
- What?

20:25.572 --> 20:26.834
No, get the fuck
out of here.

20:26.964 --> 20:28.531
- Yes.
- That's--no, it's not me.

20:28.662 --> 20:29.445
- Yes, it's like that--
- No, that's not possible.

20:29.576 --> 20:30.794
- Like that Jim Croce song,

20:30.925 --> 20:32.143
"I'll Have To Say
I Love You In a Song"

20:32.274 --> 20:33.449
'cause he couldn't tell it
to this girl's face,

20:33.580 --> 20:35.625
so he said it in a song.

20:35.756 --> 20:37.236
- Tammy, why would you think
I would ever know the lyrics

20:37.366 --> 20:38.802
to a Jim Croce song?

20:38.933 --> 20:40.630
- Lizzie, come on.
No, that's not--

20:40.761 --> 20:41.501
that's not the point here.

20:41.631 --> 20:44.286
The point is--God,

20:44.417 --> 20:46.897
Genie is in love with you.

20:47.028 --> 20:49.857
[engine rumbling]

21:06.395 --> 21:08.441
- Hey, man.
What year, '68?

21:08.571 --> 21:10.443
- Yeah.
Hey, good eye.

21:10.573 --> 21:12.793
- Yeah, I could tell by the
side markers and split grill.

21:12.923 --> 21:16.144
What you got under that hood?
The 351 or the 428?

21:16.275 --> 21:18.581
- Sorry to disappoint.
No, it's just a stock 302--

21:18.712 --> 21:20.714
with a little bit of extra.

21:20.844 --> 21:23.412
You know, nothing too big time,
but she goes.

21:23.543 --> 21:26.415
- Think you can pop it open
for me so I can take a look?

21:26.546 --> 21:28.417
- Yeah, sure.

21:30.550 --> 21:32.378
- Aw, nice.
What kind of carb you running?

21:32.508 --> 21:34.510
A Holly
or did you keep the stock?

21:34.641 --> 21:36.599
- No, yeah,
it's a Holly double pumper.

21:36.730 --> 21:38.949
This thing's gnarly, man.

21:39.080 --> 21:40.473
You know your shit, huh?

21:40.603 --> 21:41.952
- Yeah, a little bit.

21:42.083 --> 21:43.432
- A little bit.

21:43.563 --> 21:44.520
- Oh, and who did
this body work?

21:44.651 --> 21:45.739
That shit is sick.

21:45.869 --> 21:47.610
- Yeah, that was me
and my old man.

21:47.741 --> 21:49.264
Should have seen this thing
when we first got it.

21:49.395 --> 21:51.832
[scoffs] Who knows?
Maybe in a couple of years,

21:51.962 --> 21:53.355
you and your father will
do the same thing, huh?

21:53.486 --> 21:54.661
- Yeah.
Mights never.

21:54.791 --> 21:56.184
I ain't seen my old man
in years,

21:56.315 --> 21:57.620
but thanks again.

21:57.751 --> 21:59.753
I'll catch you later.

21:59.883 --> 22:01.320
- Yeah.

22:01.450 --> 22:02.843
I'll see you around.

22:04.932 --> 22:05.802
[knock on door]

22:05.933 --> 22:07.326
- Who is it?
- It's me.

22:07.456 --> 22:08.805
- Oh, come on in.

22:13.636 --> 22:15.159
- What's going on?
- Hey.

22:15.290 --> 22:16.900
Just give me a minute.
I'm looking for my passport.

22:17.031 --> 22:18.641
- Your passport?
Why?

22:18.772 --> 22:21.427
You taking a trip?
- Ooh! Yes, there it is.

22:21.557 --> 22:22.776
- Hi.
- Hi.

22:24.647 --> 22:25.996
Okay, we need to talk.
Do you want to sit down?

22:26.127 --> 22:27.781
- Sure.
- Great.

22:31.088 --> 22:32.699
Um...

22:34.657 --> 22:36.485
So I got some bad news.

22:36.616 --> 22:37.965
I mean, it's fucking
incredible news for me,

22:38.095 --> 22:40.402
but it's really--
uh, it's bad news for us.

22:40.533 --> 22:44.319
Um, I'm leaving on Monday
for Milan for a month for work.

22:44.450 --> 22:46.800
And I feel really terrible,

22:46.930 --> 22:48.410
'cause last night
was so incredible.

22:48.541 --> 22:50.543
But once again, our timing
is kind of off, you know?

22:50.673 --> 22:52.153
- Wh--really?

22:52.283 --> 22:54.460
- Yeah.

22:54.590 --> 22:58.246
- Yeah.
Yeah, that is bad news for us.

22:58.377 --> 23:00.204
But it's like you said,
it's great news for you.

23:00.335 --> 23:01.684
- Are you smiling?

23:01.815 --> 23:02.816
You happy about this?

23:02.946 --> 23:03.991
- No.

23:05.775 --> 23:06.994
I'm just relieved is all.

23:07.124 --> 23:08.648
- Relieved?

23:08.778 --> 23:10.389
What the fuck?
I thought you'd be devastated,

23:10.519 --> 23:11.607
you know, like always.

23:11.738 --> 23:13.870
- Well, it's just that

23:14.001 --> 23:15.611
I kind of promised my dad
I'd take off

23:15.742 --> 23:18.222
on this cross-country drive.

23:18.353 --> 23:20.573
He's been working on this car
for me all summer.

23:20.703 --> 23:22.488
Not that last night
wasn't great.

23:22.618 --> 23:23.924
It was.
It--

23:25.621 --> 23:27.841
Look, it really was.

23:27.971 --> 23:30.583
Brought back all sorts of...

23:30.713 --> 23:31.932
thoughts and feelings and--

23:32.062 --> 23:34.935
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I feel exactly the same way.

23:35.065 --> 23:36.676
There's no need to rush back
into a relationship.

23:36.806 --> 23:38.982
It'd be way too confusing.
- I totally agree.

23:39.113 --> 23:40.506
I totally agree.

23:40.636 --> 23:41.768
And it wouldn't be fair
to you either.

23:41.898 --> 23:43.465
You're taking off for a month.

23:43.596 --> 23:45.989
You shouldn't be focused on--

23:46.120 --> 23:47.687
on me or us.

23:47.817 --> 23:50.254
You--you got to focus
on doing a great job.

23:50.385 --> 23:51.995
- Yeah.
- Okay, this is your time, too.

23:52.126 --> 23:54.302
- Yeah.
That's really, really smart

23:54.433 --> 23:55.477
and mature of you,
Jimmy Farrell.

23:55.608 --> 23:57.610
I'm very impressed.
- Wow.

23:57.740 --> 24:00.569
Mature and smart.
Me?

24:00.700 --> 24:01.744
Two things you never
accused me of before.

24:01.875 --> 24:03.267
- [laughs]

24:03.398 --> 24:05.008
- At least as it relates
to our relationship.

24:05.139 --> 24:06.575
- Yeah, well.

24:13.539 --> 24:14.801
Okay.

24:16.585 --> 24:18.326
- Um--
[clears throat]

24:18.457 --> 24:20.763
well, maybe I'll--
uh, I'll still see you tonight.

24:20.894 --> 24:21.764
Tammy told you we're
doing a bonfire

24:21.895 --> 24:22.765
at the Promised Land, right?

24:22.896 --> 24:23.766
- Yeah, yeah, she told me.

24:23.897 --> 24:24.811
Stacey's gonna come, too.

24:24.941 --> 24:25.986
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

24:26.116 --> 24:27.466
- Cool.

24:27.596 --> 24:28.858
All right, well, uh,

24:28.989 --> 24:30.381
we'll have the whole crew
back together again.

24:30.512 --> 24:31.948
- Mm-hmm.

24:34.037 --> 24:36.649
See you there.

24:36.779 --> 24:38.955
- Yeah.
Yeah, see you there.

24:49.052 --> 24:50.053
- [grumbles]

24:54.797 --> 24:56.103
[knocks on door]

25:04.198 --> 25:06.374
Hey.

25:06.505 --> 25:08.028
- What do you want?

25:08.158 --> 25:10.421
- I'm sorry. I just wanted
to say I'm--I'm sorry.

25:10.552 --> 25:12.119
So, sorry.

25:13.599 --> 25:14.948
- Okay.

25:15.078 --> 25:18.081
- And, um,
I was talking to Tammy,

25:18.212 --> 25:21.607
and she's--she--
she said she thinks

25:21.737 --> 25:25.436
that the song
that you wrote is about us.

25:25.567 --> 25:28.788
And that I'm--that I'm Linda.

25:28.918 --> 25:30.790
And I was thinking about
the lyrics later and like,

25:30.920 --> 25:32.922
you know, the Paul--
the Paul McCartney reference.

25:33.053 --> 25:34.837
That's what that was, right?
That's amazing.

25:34.968 --> 25:36.926
That was like--
that's inspired and so subtle.

25:37.057 --> 25:40.495
It's really good.
But, um--

25:40.626 --> 25:41.844
but, yeah, is that true,
am I Linda?

25:44.586 --> 25:46.153
- Yeah.

25:48.111 --> 25:50.026
What do you think about that?

26:02.169 --> 26:03.953
[soft music]

26:04.084 --> 26:06.869
[laughs]

26:07.000 --> 26:08.915
- Sorry, did I--
does that--is that okay?

26:09.045 --> 26:10.438
Should I not--
should I not have done--

26:10.569 --> 26:12.527
- Yeah, it was okay,
you dummy.

26:12.658 --> 26:14.529
- Okay. Okay.

26:14.660 --> 26:16.444
[laughter]

26:16.575 --> 26:18.664
- Wait, listen, I know--I know
I'm a little high right now,

26:18.794 --> 26:20.666
but you know
what this reminds me of?

26:20.796 --> 26:22.189
The six of us sitting here
in a circle.

26:22.319 --> 26:24.583
Remember back in junior high
when we'd take our bikes

26:24.713 --> 26:26.628
over here and we played spin
the bottle with each other?

26:26.759 --> 26:28.630
- [chuckling]Yeah.

26:28.761 --> 26:30.545
Yeah, until, you know,

26:30.676 --> 26:32.808
Jill would land on Jimmy
and it would end the game

26:32.939 --> 26:34.157
'cause they'd go make out
for an hour.

26:34.288 --> 26:36.029
- Oh, yeah.

26:36.159 --> 26:38.466
- Whoops.
- You know what we should do?

26:38.597 --> 26:40.599
I think we should play
right now

26:40.729 --> 26:42.078
for old time's sake.

26:43.906 --> 26:45.821
You fucking wish, Pags.

26:45.952 --> 26:46.953
[laughter]
- Hey, fuck off.

26:47.083 --> 26:48.868
You're--
you're my flesh and blood.

26:48.998 --> 26:49.999
You're my sister.
I wouldn't fuck--

26:50.130 --> 26:51.522
- I'm not your fucking sister.

26:51.653 --> 26:53.916
- Okay!
It's essentially.

26:55.614 --> 26:58.617
- Hey, well, speaking
of fucking around, can we talk?

26:58.747 --> 27:01.663
- We'll see you two in an hour.
- Shut the fuck up.

27:01.794 --> 27:04.013
- Jimmy and Jill
went up the hill.

27:04.144 --> 27:06.712
- Yeah, to fuck in the back
of his Cougar.

27:06.842 --> 27:09.105
[laughter]

27:09.236 --> 27:12.239
["I Love You"
by Climax Blues Band playing]

27:13.196 --> 27:15.546
- So what's going on, huh?
Is everything all right?

27:15.677 --> 27:18.071
- No, everything's
not all right.

27:18.201 --> 27:19.899
Everything's fucked up.
Everything's a fucking mess.

27:20.029 --> 27:21.683
- What, because of me?
- Yeah, 'cause of you,

27:21.814 --> 27:23.990
and 'cause of me 'cause...

27:24.120 --> 27:25.905
I'm really pissed off
about our conversation earlier,

27:26.035 --> 27:29.517
'cause you being fine,
I'm--I'm not fine.

27:29.648 --> 27:30.997
I don't want to pretend that
I'm fine leaving you again,

27:31.127 --> 27:32.781
'cause I'm not fine
leaving you again.

27:32.912 --> 27:34.609
- Well, it's about time
you realized that.

I feel like I shouldn't go.

27:36.916 --> 27:38.134

Whoa, whoa.

27:38.265 --> 27:40.180
No way.
What, are you kidding me?

27:40.310 --> 27:42.661
This is a great
opportunity for you.

27:42.791 --> 27:44.880
Look, look. Hey.

27:45.011 --> 27:47.753
Trust me, I--I know
how hard and scary it is

27:47.883 --> 27:49.189
to take off
and leave home, okay?

27:49.319 --> 27:52.758
Especially when you're
leaving somebody behind.

27:52.888 --> 27:53.715
But this is something
you've been

27:53.846 --> 27:54.934
dreaming about
your whole life.

27:55.064 --> 27:56.065
- But, like,
a lot can happen in a month.

27:56.196 --> 27:57.980
I don't want to risk that.

27:58.111 --> 27:59.808
And I know that I'm always
the one that's, like,

27:59.939 --> 28:02.158
pushing you away, pushing you
away and asking for space.

28:02.289 --> 28:04.160
And now I feel like you need
to come closer to me.

28:04.291 --> 28:06.685
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Jill, Jill.

28:06.815 --> 28:09.731
This is kind of seeming like
a bit of a freak out, right?

28:09.862 --> 28:11.646
But that's usually
what I do, right?

28:11.777 --> 28:13.604
- Sure.
But like, I've been

28:13.735 --> 28:14.823
really trying
to convince myself

28:14.954 --> 28:16.216
for a long time
that I don't need you.

28:16.346 --> 28:19.262
And today, I just kind of
realized that I do need you.

28:19.393 --> 28:21.700
So I'm--
I'm sorry for freaking out.

28:21.830 --> 28:23.310
- You know, for months
I've been trying to tell myself

28:23.440 --> 28:25.268
that I don't need you.

28:25.399 --> 28:30.534
And the more I say it,
the less I believe it,

28:30.665 --> 28:32.145
'cause I love you, Jill.

28:33.973 --> 28:36.062
I fucking love you.

28:36.192 --> 28:38.934
And, uh...

28:39.065 --> 28:40.240
I can't fucking
believe I'm saying this,

28:40.370 --> 28:41.197
but you're getting
on that plane,

28:41.328 --> 28:43.156

28:43.286 --> 28:45.636

your fucking chance.

And I'm gonna get in this car
my fucking dad built for me,

29:11.706 --> 29:14.883
and--and I'm gonna go
on that road trip.

29:15.014 --> 29:16.189
And in a month,
we'll come back and--

29:16.319 --> 29:18.582

what's next.

29:18.713 --> 29:20.541

I know what's next.

us is next.

"We're gonna figure it out,"

it sounds like
we're kind of not

29:28.679 --> 29:30.072

so it just, like--

29:30.203 --> 29:32.248
- Hey, when you say,
"We'll figure it out"

29:32.379 --> 29:34.337
it usually means
we're breaking up.

29:34.468 --> 29:37.079

we'll figure it out.
